[28.94 --> 31.88]  No, I'm just convincing like that. I am an actor
[33.32 --> 38.46]  So I could act angry and you can act sick watch I'm gonna seem not enthused about this next topic
[40.46 --> 42.88]  Apple is setting its users free and
[43.62 --> 48.16]  Freedom is scary for them see here that part that blade I can tell
[50.86 --> 54.42]  Guys all I said was that I was an actor I didn't say it was a good one
[54.42 --> 58.08]  What else we got Texas schools embrace AI
[58.62 --> 64.54]  Graders. Oh, no, this is actually bad. No, this is really really this great everything about it is bad
[64.54 --> 66.74]  Don't you want this your future?
[67.98 --> 71.24]  Evaluated by AI that's good, right? Oh, that's awesome
[71.88 --> 73.80]  And what the heck is going on on YouTube?
[74.50 --> 77.36]  What are these these playables? What do they mean?
[77.68 --> 83.38]  Yeah, why are they here? Wait, are you asking because you actually don't know or are you just reading the headline a little bit about our doc?
[83.38 --> 86.80]  Nice, I've seen it and I was like, huh? And then I just ignored it nice
[86.80 --> 88.42]  And I'm gonna learn what it is and you know what?
[88.42 --> 93.58]  I know it's really early in the show and normally we run the intro here, but I just want to do wait
[93.58 --> 99.86]  Where's the oh by the way if you're on flow plane check out beta dot flow plane comm there's a react only version of the site and
[99.86 --> 105.76]  There won't be a significant amount change for you, but we need some feedback on it because it's it's likely some things are
[106.50 --> 108.94]  Not perfect. All right, we need to fix them for the go left
[108.94 --> 111.36]  But this is really important before we run the intro
[111.36 --> 117.58]  This is worth breaking the format for pre-sales for this year's limited edition Terry Fox run shirt
[117.72 --> 124.14]  They're now live you can get them at Terry Fox org all proceeds support cancer research that is
[124.14 --> 131.38]  Research for how to get rid of cancer not not for not for like upgrading it

[138.72 --> 141.82]  This is a super cool cause Terry Fox is a national hero
[141.82 --> 143.12]  and
[143.12 --> 148.26]  If you're aware of him and you're not Canadian then he's your hero too because he's actually that amazing
[148.26 --> 156.42]  Yeah, so Terry Fox org guys check it out no matter what you don't want the shirt for whatever reason they they can take direct donations as well
[156.42 --> 159.32]  Yeah, so Terry Fox org check that out. Let's roll that intro
[178.26 --> 184.82]  The show is brought to you today by AG one Ridge and Vessi
[184.82 --> 187.88]  So we jump right into our headline topic here
[187.88 --> 188.96]  Yes
[188.96 --> 191.82]  Good. What is it? Oh, yes
[191.82 --> 196.70]  The CEO of the motion picture association told a convention
[196.70 --> 206.80]  Of theater owners that the organization is planning to work with the United States Congress on legislation to require American ISPs to block
[206.80 --> 209.54]  piracy related websites
[209.54 --> 213.52]  With all the other stuff that they have to work on like the cost of insulin
[213.52 --> 216.70]  I'm sure this is a top priority and oh wait
[216.70 --> 227.44]  Uh, okay. Hmm. This might have a chance the proposed legislation would allow copyright holders to petition a judge to block a given site
[228.34 --> 236.22]  CEO Charles Rivkin claimed that piracy steals hundreds of thousands of jobs from workers and tens of billions of dollars
[236.22 --> 241.60]  From their economy including more than 1 billion in theatrical ticket sales in the United States
[241.60 --> 245.04]  Both tech companies and internet advocacy groups have warned
[245.04 --> 250.90]  That this proposed framework is likely to lead to over blocking of lawful content
[250.90 --> 257.34]  Yeah, which is what wound up undermining the stop online piracy act SOPA over a decade ago
[257.34 --> 261.52]  So our discussion question here is is this going to work?
[261.52 --> 262.52]  Um
[262.52 --> 271.34]  I I honestly don't necessarily feel like it would work even if it does go through they have to petition the individual sites
[271.34 --> 276.98]  They'll just spin up another Luke. I mean here's here's the domain is unimportant. Here's the question though
[277.62 --> 283.10]  What is this going to do that couldn't already be blocked with a VPN?
[283.10 --> 289.80]  Couldn't already be worked around yeah, exactly. Yeah, like what is this going because okay?
[290.38 --> 296.22]  Already already if you download a copyrighted work, okay, look, I'm just gonna I'm gonna come out and say it
[296.22 --> 298.30]  We were doing some video on emulating
[298.30 --> 303.64]  Something and it was more convenient for me to just download a Final Fantasy Tactics ISO than to rip it
[303.64 --> 307.10]  So I did and I didn't have my VPN on actually did this at work
[307.10 --> 312.66]  Um, and we got a notice we got it. We got a notice from our internet service provider
[312.66 --> 317.04]  Where they the rights holder. I don't actually was it Final Fantasy Tactics?
[317.04 --> 319.32]  I don't remember it was it was something that was
[319.32 --> 322.82]  Why does he do this from my point of view not morally an issue?
[322.82 --> 325.78]  Why does he do these things? I just because there I will never know
[325.78 --> 331.10]  It's not a moral issue to me to download a copy you do it on the work network. Oh, I was so lazy
[331.10 --> 336.46]  I didn't have my VPN installed but don't do that. Well, yeah, I know what look Luke
[337.38 --> 341.44]  This was like years ago, okay, you you weren't even working all right now. I don't care
[341.44 --> 346.02]  Yeah, it wasn't easy. Anyway, the point is like weeks ago. I was like, what are you talking about?
[346.02 --> 351.54]  The point is I don't personally considered a problem to download a copy of a game that I own that I don't care
[351.54 --> 354.08]  Yeah, I don't care and from my point of view
[354.08 --> 360.66]  You can tell me all day that I only own a license to use the game and its exact form and on the exact device that I don't I
[360.66 --> 361.98]  Actually don't care about any of that
[361.98 --> 368.42]  So anyway, I own the game from my point of view and I will download it if I feel like it, but I got a notice
[368.42 --> 375.62]  From my ISP that the DMCA rights holders blah blah blah had notified them that they forwarded it
[375.62 --> 381.46]  There's no actual punishment here. They can't actually do anything. They can't turn off your internet or anything like that
[381.46 --> 384.00]  But they already know
[384.00 --> 385.14]  um
[385.14 --> 390.70]  What is this exactly going to do? How are how are you going to enforce this?
[391.20 --> 391.68]  Unless
[391.68 --> 399.36]  You basically do you know back to our sort of our our title for this unless you actually do create like
[399.36 --> 401.22]  an authoritarian
[401.22 --> 402.74]  internet
[402.74 --> 405.72]  Censorship system. Yeah, yeah
[405.72 --> 411.20]  Like just blocking a website tools for it, you know, yeah, just well here's a question for you
[411.20 --> 416.82]  I mean, what are the odds that the American government basically already has it and is kind of ready to actually I don't know if they're that organized
[416.82 --> 419.86]  Never mind. I take it back
[419.86 --> 421.36]  I
[421.36 --> 427.18]  Mean they can see sites and they they could sure this type of stuff happen, but like it's slow
[427.18 --> 432.66]  Yes, and it's not really it's not really very effective and that's why you're on a larger scale
[432.66 --> 438.88]  That's why instead of going after them one by one and trying to get the trying to go after the
[438.88 --> 440.32]  um
[440.32 --> 447.38]  Trying to go after the companies that are providing them hosting or trying to go after their domain registrar or trying to go
[447.38 --> 452.82]  That's why instead of trying to go after them in in all these ways to get the site actually taken down
[452.82 --> 458.98]  They're trying to simply block users access to it. But my point with my story was that
[458.98 --> 464.36]  If you pirate content, you probably are already using a vpn anyway
[464.36 --> 475.48]  What difference will this make unless they fundamentally change the way that internet access works in north america?
[475.48 --> 478.16]  I mean, there's also stuff like I
[478.16 --> 483.98]  Don't know if you've gotten to this line yet. Maybe you have a ceo charles rivkin claimed that piracy steals
[483.98 --> 488.00]  I just thousand jobs including 1 billion theatrical ticket sales like no
[489.36 --> 493.34]  And there's there's there's all these arguments like I find it pretty interesting of
[493.90 --> 499.16]  Companies on steam steam has a very good and robust regional pricing tool
[499.82 --> 503.20]  And and companies are finding like they'll they'll see a lot of
[503.76 --> 505.76]  piracy in a single area
[506.22 --> 510.10]  Maybe wondering how they do that you look at like language in the discussion of the thing
[510.10 --> 514.28]  And then they'll adjust the pricing that area to be more reasonable
[514.28 --> 518.34]  Like maybe your take home is significantly lower your cost of living significantly higher
[518.34 --> 524.40]  You don't have the spending money to buy something in the equivalency of American dollars of whatever it's supposed to be
[524.40 --> 529.38]  They make it cheaper piracy drops off like a rock people are saying luke brazil luke brazil. Yeah
[529.38 --> 534.52]  There's a lot of examples pirate software has a video on on him reducing the cost of his game in brazil
[534.52 --> 538.98]  Specifically piracy shot down and his sales in that country went way up
[539.76 --> 546.30]  Because it's it's not that necessarily people want to pirate in order to effectively steal something from a company
[546.30 --> 550.80]  It's often that that thing is not super attainable either. You can't get it very easily
[551.04 --> 556.94]  Or it costs too much and it's like well right now with 10 billion different streaming services
[558.20 --> 561.96]  Acquiring video content can be really annoying and to be clear
[561.96 --> 565.08]  I also don't buy the argument that there is zero impact
[565.08 --> 568.20]  I'm, sorry, but there are people for whom
[568.20 --> 574.82]  They just aren't paying because they just if they don't have to they'd rather not but they could afford to
[574.82 --> 576.28]  um, so
[576.28 --> 584.72]  As usual with any argument the truth is somewhere in the middle is this stealing hundreds of thousands of jobs?
[585.26 --> 587.42]  Well, you know what? I don't know
[587.42 --> 589.06]  worldwide
[589.06 --> 595.30]  Gee man, that's a lot like how many how many bloody how many yeah, how do you even quantify that also also?
[595.30 --> 598.26]  Where is your where is your hand wringing?
[598.82 --> 599.82]  when
[599.82 --> 603.24]  You know, you've got a I encroaching on the industry
[603.92 --> 607.80]  From every side. Oh, yes, let's please use that as much as possible
[608.04 --> 613.70]  And like one of the issues that I have with this is I'm assuming that there's some equivalency of amount of times that something was pirated
[613.70 --> 618.26]  To the amount of money that you lost but it just doesn't work that way like when I was a kid pirating games
[618.26 --> 623.46]  I was not going to buy it if you made piracy and piracy impossible
[623.46 --> 627.70]  There just would have been no sale. I just would not have played that game. There was no
[628.34 --> 632.98]  Not give take everyone is like that though either. I know but I do I pirated games
[632.98 --> 634.98]  I could have afforded to buy when I was young
[635.46 --> 637.62]  Would you have bought them if you couldn't have pirated it?
[638.66 --> 646.02]  Um, I think in a lot of cases probably no i'm trying to think it's been a very long time and I don't really remember
[646.50 --> 652.58]  Here's something that I always found kind of interesting about my own habits was that if I pirated a game
[652.58 --> 656.42]  I tended not to really play it very much and I don't know what it is
[656.42 --> 660.18]  Like we've talked about this on the show before how like when I when when we were kids
[661.86 --> 666.58]  Pretty much everyone that I knew had no had somewhere between two and oh
[667.22 --> 669.22]  man, i'm trying to think like
[669.38 --> 673.78]  Five or six games for their console. Yeah, like we did not have
[674.58 --> 681.14]  If someone if I went to someone's house and they had like 10 or 20 nintendo games. Oh, you're rich. I was like, whoa
[681.14 --> 688.26]  Like damn there's some money here. Yeah, um, and we played those games
[689.06 --> 693.46]  Over and over and over and over and over again and for me
[695.38 --> 698.34]  Piracy was like this it it became like
[699.30 --> 706.42]  Like it was almost like my first exposure to kind of one of the problems with gaming now is that there's too many options so many options
[706.42 --> 712.74]  And such a finite amount of time that you can't possibly hope to enjoy them all
[713.30 --> 713.54]  um
[713.54 --> 719.54]  I don't I don't think I can think of a game that I actually played for a substantial amount of time
[720.26 --> 724.18]  That I pirated and then never ultimately bought bought. Yeah
[724.74 --> 726.74]  Um, so those aren't lost sales either
[727.38 --> 728.34]  Like I
[728.34 --> 733.70]  Obviously, there are going to be lost sales from piracy but saying that you can try to quantify it is like what?
[734.34 --> 734.90]  I don't know
[735.54 --> 740.98]  Where are you getting this one billion dollars in theatrical ticket sales because I have a major doubt on that one
[742.90 --> 745.86]  I mean, it's not that much in the grand scheme of things
[745.86 --> 749.54]  I mean when a single movie will do a billion dollars in ticket sales from time to time
[749.54 --> 754.10]  I mean, it's not like they're saying oh, yeah, we're we're selling half as many tickets as we would have if
[754.10 --> 761.54]  uh, um, if piracy wasn't a thing or whatever else I think there I that actually if they were saying a billion more tickets
[762.10 --> 768.58]  Obviously, we'd have to say strong down saying tens of billions of dollars from our economy including more than 1 billion in ticket sales
[768.58 --> 772.42]  The only reason why they said ticket sales is because it's the theater owners organization
[772.98 --> 776.66]  But they're saying tens of billions of dollars from the economy. I just don't believe that
[776.66 --> 778.66]  I
[778.66 --> 781.30]  Have a really hard time without any sources cited
[781.86 --> 790.26]  Believing tens of billions of dollars would show up in the american economy if they somehow deleted piracy. I don't see it happening
[791.06 --> 795.30]  I think the bigger issue for me is that we haven't really
[797.70 --> 800.42]  Oh, man, yeah, it's a tough one because you know
[800.42 --> 804.58]  At other points on this show we've talked about how
[805.30 --> 811.14]  The media production industry is obviously in trouble right now. Oh, it's in huge trouble
[812.10 --> 817.70]  But when you when you kind of dig down and try and figure out okay, like, you know, what is the trouble? Where is it coming from?
[818.50 --> 824.82]  Um, it seems to be from a lack of of of truly creative innovative
[825.38 --> 828.42]  Content right like when you're a realization of everything when you look at what happened
[828.42 --> 832.34]  I mean and it's funny because i'm the examples i'm about to use of of something that
[832.98 --> 841.86]  That broke out of the the doldrums that the movie industry is in are both huge ips right like the super mario movie and barbie, right?
[842.50 --> 849.62]  Um, but I think that showed that there's absolutely an appetite the problem with this is that the problem with this whole argument and
[850.58 --> 852.74]  Man, i'm gonna be in trouble for a hot take here
[852.74 --> 858.98]  Um, the problem with this argument that you've stolen hundreds of thousands of jobs from workers
[859.46 --> 863.46]  Is that I don't think that right now there is a?
[864.50 --> 866.18]  Um, there is a a content
[866.82 --> 872.18]  Volume problem when it comes to low quality garbage that people don't want to watch anyway
[872.58 --> 875.78]  I think the content problem that we have is innovative
[876.66 --> 878.18]  exciting
[878.18 --> 879.70]  content yeah and
[880.50 --> 881.38]  No offense
[882.18 --> 885.38]  But you are not hiring those hundreds of thousands of people
[886.18 --> 887.62]  Yeah in your hypothetical
[887.70 --> 894.50]  Scenario where there is no piracy and you have way more tickets fighting really hard to not hire them how many actual
[895.38 --> 896.26]  like
[896.26 --> 897.38]  directors have
[898.02 --> 904.50]  Financially successful, you know, let's say more than three financially successful movies under their belt and it's gonna be
[905.14 --> 907.14]  This is a number that's going to be in the dozens or hundreds
[907.86 --> 913.78]  Not the thousands tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands and obviously there's more than a director that just works on a movie
[913.78 --> 920.10]  But my point is just how small that tip of the iceberg of what we see at hollywood
[920.10 --> 925.22]  Is the the ones that break out the ones that are super successful versus the ones that?
[925.78 --> 926.18]  um
[927.14 --> 932.26]  Are just working on yet another reality tv show like are you telling me that if you had?
[933.22 --> 936.42]  More movie ticket sales you would stop making
[937.30 --> 942.74]  You know just stupid random reality tv series and you would you would you just be incentivized
[942.74 --> 947.46]  You take a home run swing at a movie. I don't know man. I don't know if I buy it
[947.46 --> 952.90]  Yeah, I just the the argument stinks in my opinion
[955.22 --> 960.98]  I'm not i'm not saying like rah rah piracy or anything. I just think a lot of the arguments around it are
[961.94 --> 963.94]  um
[963.94 --> 965.62]  very sensationalized
[965.62 --> 968.90]  I think i'm sure there's a financial impact to the industry
[969.62 --> 971.62]  um
[971.94 --> 973.94]  I think in in my opinion the
[974.66 --> 981.38]  Movie industry in general has always had a like acquisition issue movies and tv shows like how do I get this thing?
[982.26 --> 985.38]  What temporary service do I have to subscribe to to be able to watch it?
[985.54 --> 991.78]  I can't get a permanent copy at all anymore. That's the biggest problem for me right now. Yeah, like there's so many issues with that
[992.10 --> 993.30]  I
[993.30 --> 994.18]  I
[994.18 --> 996.18]  Could not really understand
[996.90 --> 1000.82]  What the point of piracy was during the golden days of netflix?
[1001.14 --> 1002.42]  Yeah, totally agreed
[1002.42 --> 1006.50]  I'm pretty sure we talked on wancho about like, you know putting the hat in the closet
[1006.98 --> 1008.98]  Because like there's no reason right now
[1008.98 --> 1009.54]  I
[1009.54 --> 1016.18]  Now it's strongly coming back out. Obviously, they don't have hard numbers on this, but I was reading a different article
[1016.18 --> 1018.82]  um, not the one that was about this recently
[1019.38 --> 1020.66]  that um
[1020.66 --> 1027.38]  Figured based on some number that someone pulled out of their butt somewhere that piracy was up about 12 year over year
[1027.94 --> 1028.66]  um
[1028.66 --> 1031.22]  And this is this is in america not surprised at all
[1032.02 --> 1034.66]  It doesn't surprise me one bit. I am
[1035.06 --> 1042.98]  simply not going to subscribe to disney plus and amazon prime and netflix and hulu and
[1043.06 --> 1045.06]  paramount plus and
[1045.22 --> 1050.18]  Whatever the hbo one is called now. I was sitting here trying to think of what its name was
[1051.06 --> 1056.26]  I don't care. I don't know. I don't care. Oh, yeah, it's ridiculous. I haven't seen game of thrones
[1056.82 --> 1057.70]  Yeah
[1057.70 --> 1062.18]  Because you don't have the thing well, that's also because I don't want to until he's done writing the books
[1062.18 --> 1066.90]  But I just mean I I don't think i've seen it. I don't think i've seen an hbo show since
[1068.82 --> 1075.30]  Oh, we're saying crave max is oh hbo max. Yeah, max. That's right craving one with letter kenny crave crave
[1075.30 --> 1080.98]  Crave licenses hbo shows in canada. Yeah crave crave has letter kenny, which is great, but then
[1081.62 --> 1087.54]  I don't want anything else on crave so it's just like I guess i'll subscribe and then try to binge watch it really hard and then leave
[1087.86 --> 1089.86]  Like I want to just buy it
[1090.02 --> 1093.70]  Syphilis says lol poor linus. He's gonna die before that book is done
[1094.42 --> 1096.42]  Are you is that a threat?
[1096.42 --> 1098.66]  Are you threatening me? I'm kidding. I know he means george rr
[1098.66 --> 1102.98]  I just what am I not allowed to pretend to misunderstand things. No
[1104.26 --> 1108.10]  Okay, oh, I can buy the deep they're just dvds. What's a dvd?
[1108.90 --> 1110.10]  letter kenny
[1110.10 --> 1114.42]  Oh, okay, cool, but I want blu-rays. I don't ever just use a I upscaling
[1118.02 --> 1126.10]  Got that good. I haven't done it. It's getting pretty good. Um, no, I wouldn't say that you can go to 480p and are from 480p and it'll be
[1126.10 --> 1130.82]  a great experience. Um, if you've got at least a 720p source
[1131.94 --> 1135.14]  It's looking pretty good on a 1080p source 4k is
[1136.74 --> 1144.18]  Like why bother? Yeah, um one thing that's not there yet is the sdr to hdr up conversion
[1145.06 --> 1148.74]  But I like seeing where nvidia's at with that today
[1149.30 --> 1154.74]  Right seeing where they started with upscaling in games and where they are now. Oh
[1155.38 --> 1159.62]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I think we're headed in in if give them a few more years and
[1161.14 --> 1161.94]  uh
[1161.94 --> 1164.18]  If they ever finally release a new shield pro
[1164.98 --> 1172.26]  So some more hardware give them a few more years and some more hardware and I am I am pretty stoked on where I think we're gonna be with
[1173.14 --> 1178.18]  Just being able to enjoy whatever copy of a piece of media you happen to own
[1178.18 --> 1181.78]  At whatever resolution and color space you want
[1182.98 --> 1188.18]  Obviously, it would be better to have a human do it properly and the definitive
[1188.90 --> 1193.62]  Piece uh or like the definitive version of that content is probably going to be that
[1194.18 --> 1200.90]  But I think that ai upscaling and ai sdr to hdr conversion is going to be good enough for most people
[1201.46 --> 1201.78]  um
[1201.78 --> 1209.54]  um, with that said a lot of the time the newer grade is not necessarily better if people are apparently like super p.o'd about
[1209.86 --> 1210.58]  uh
[1210.58 --> 1214.26]  Aliens is blu-ray 4k blu-ray release. Oh, yeah
[1214.90 --> 1218.98]  Something something it's it's more of it's more of like the film buff type stuff
[1219.46 --> 1223.14]  Than what I think the average person would care about but it's pretty common
[1223.14 --> 1229.70]  Not just to get like, you know, the the star wars or or et effect where they you know digitally remove
[1230.58 --> 1236.10]  Guns or you know who shot first or whatever else right? It's it's it's not all that kind of thing. Um,
[1236.10 --> 1240.10]  Sometimes it's just like oh, yeah, they they didn't go back to the original
[1240.74 --> 1241.54]  um
[1241.54 --> 1244.18]  Film like they they didn't restore it. They just took
[1244.74 --> 1246.50]  uh some some other
[1247.06 --> 1247.78]  um
[1247.78 --> 1249.22]  master and just kind of
[1250.02 --> 1256.66]  You know, I don't know applied an upscaling filter and then sharpened it and then re softened it to make it kind of look like
[1256.66 --> 1260.42]  It was higher res um, so I don't know exactly what happened with
[1261.94 --> 1262.82]  uh aliens
[1263.38 --> 1265.22]  Let's see if anyone is yeah, it looks like
[1265.78 --> 1272.42]  This is something that hasn't really made its way outside of you know r slash blu-ray or whatever the the blu-ray enthusiast subreddit is
[1272.42 --> 1274.26]  I don't even remember anymore, but
[1275.78 --> 1278.26]  Uh, some some people are definitely mad about it
[1279.86 --> 1280.58]  Oh, yeah, okay
[1280.58 --> 1286.74]  Someone said the matrix had some mastering issues where they got rid of the green and blue tints and that that's the kind of thing that can happen
[1287.46 --> 1291.38]  Accidentally if someone's working on and I don't know if that's what happened in that case
[1291.38 --> 1296.10]  But that's something that can happen accidentally if the people working on the the remaster
[1296.58 --> 1297.62]  Don't
[1297.62 --> 1302.42]  Understand or remember the original intent for why it was graded in that particular way and
[1302.42 --> 1304.42]  I
[1304.42 --> 1304.90]  I
[1304.90 --> 1308.58]  I was spending some googling trying to figure out how to get
[1309.06 --> 1313.70]  Shorzy and letter kenny, which is the two shows from the same group that are highly related same universe
[1314.26 --> 1315.06]  um
[1315.06 --> 1319.14]  And and a lot of the responses are like yeah, it's super annoying
[1319.14 --> 1323.70]  You just have to like actively be subscribed to crave by the junkie dvds or
[1323.70 --> 1324.34]  Or
[1324.34 --> 1328.34]  Insert what you can assume right and it's like yeah
[1328.34 --> 1329.14]  Yep
[1329.14 --> 1329.54]  Why
[1329.54 --> 1335.06]  Why can't I just get a high quality version that I can watch whenever I want?
[1335.62 --> 1340.18]  I don't want to binge they have like eight seasons of letter kenny and like multiple seasons of shorts
[1340.42 --> 1344.10]  No, I don't want to have a financial incentive to subscribe for one month
[1344.18 --> 1348.42]  And then just degen super hard and watch all of this in one month and then shut it off
[1348.98 --> 1350.98]  like just let me own the copies
[1351.62 --> 1352.50]  in
[1352.50 --> 1354.50]  decent quality
[1355.78 --> 1356.66]  And
[1356.66 --> 1359.70]  I've been pretty firm that i'm not gonna buy
[1359.70 --> 1365.14]  Any copy of a movie or tv show that is reliant upon a service staying up
[1365.70 --> 1367.70]  And we are already seeing
[1368.82 --> 1373.62]  That prediction of mine that anything that you buy from a web shop
[1374.18 --> 1376.66]  That is reliant upon accessing it through that web
[1376.66 --> 1381.38]  Or authorizing or anything like that you do not own yeah, they'll take it down. They'll edit it. They'll change
[1381.38 --> 1383.06]  They'll get acquired. It doesn't matter
[1383.86 --> 1385.46]  So this is one of those things where
[1385.46 --> 1390.34]  Guys to be clear. I mean, I think that you've heard my stance on piracy enough times
[1391.46 --> 1393.94]  Does it have does it have harms?
[1395.14 --> 1399.62]  Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's any question of that. Is it as easy to quantify as
[1400.66 --> 1404.82]  executives will make it sound when they're doing a little presentation to their little industry buddies
[1406.02 --> 1406.98]  No
[1406.98 --> 1411.38]  Are we telling you never do it or you're a bad person for doing it? No, we're not doing that either
[1411.38 --> 1414.02]  We're just telling you, you know, consider consider the impact
[1414.02 --> 1416.02]  Yeah, that's all I say
[1417.46 --> 1417.86]  Um
[1418.66 --> 1423.94]  And also good luck mpa you are going to have to fundamentally shift
[1424.90 --> 1430.58]  The north american the western philosophy of the internet in order to make this work
[1430.58 --> 1433.78]  And I really just don't think it's going to happen. Yeah
[1434.66 --> 1438.98]  Might be time to dust the hats off if you don't have one you can get it into the store
[1438.98 --> 1440.18]  Yeah, it's funny joke
[1441.22 --> 1444.66]  I'm trying to have plausible deniability that i'm not telling people to become pirates
[1445.70 --> 1446.42]  Really? Yeah
[1446.90 --> 1449.86]  And your way of doing that was telling them that they could do
[1450.18 --> 1451.62]  Oh way to go way to go
[1451.62 --> 1453.46]  Where did you even go? What did you where where?
[1453.46 --> 1456.74]  I just closed it. Oh, you closed it. Yeah, so you're sorry
[1456.74 --> 1459.14]  Your way was to tell them to buy a hat
[1459.14 --> 1463.46]  Yeah, because it was my plausible deniability that I wasn't saying pirate hat
[1463.46 --> 1464.02]  I see
[1464.82 --> 1466.42]  Prove that's not a pirate hat
[1468.90 --> 1475.22]  Modern pirates wear any hat they want also I couldn't help noticing that it is water resistant
[1475.22 --> 1480.82]  Which is perfect when you are on the high seas on the high seas
[1486.02 --> 1488.82]  Oh boy should we rename it to pirate hat?
[1491.38 --> 1495.70]  Kind of tempted just include like a trial for a vpn
[1497.78 --> 1499.78]  Change nothing change nothing just
[1501.70 --> 1503.70]  Okay
[1505.22 --> 1506.98]  Hear me out
[1509.06 --> 1513.22]  Do we take a vpn sponsorship again if we're just like
[1514.26 --> 1515.38]  here's the talking points
[1516.34 --> 1517.30]  it's for piracy
[1521.54 --> 1525.94]  That's the world's most honest vpn pitch I feel like the biggest issue with them
[1527.70 --> 1529.46]  is the talking points so like
[1529.46 --> 1533.14]  I mean our talking points were always fine clean
[1533.14 --> 1538.18]  Yeah, like it's one of those things where I feel like a lot of the negativity around vpn sponsorships
[1538.74 --> 1539.06]  was
[1540.18 --> 1546.98]  From creators who and to be clear. I don't actually blame them. You cannot expect every random
[1547.94 --> 1550.50]  makeup or gaming or
[1551.30 --> 1558.26]  Nature or history creator to completely understand the ins and outs of a technology product
[1558.26 --> 1560.26]  Like a vpn
[1560.26 --> 1565.30]  You know should creators have a responsibility for the products that they promote? Yeah, yes
[1565.86 --> 1566.98]  but I also
[1566.98 --> 1574.50]  think that the issues around vpns are a little bit more complicated and nuanced
[1574.98 --> 1576.10]  than
[1576.10 --> 1578.34]  You could reasonably expect you know
[1579.30 --> 1583.22]  Your aunt who makes youtube videos to fully grasp
[1584.82 --> 1591.86]  And so you know we pushed back on the vpn providers that we worked with especially as as my knowledge grew about them
[1591.86 --> 1597.70]  And we ensured that our talking points were aligned with what we believed was the usefulness of vpns
[1598.26 --> 1598.58]  um
[1601.38 --> 1608.18]  But I think a lot of negativity around vpn sponsorship came from these people who were promoting them in ways that just were not
[1609.14 --> 1610.02]  true
[1610.02 --> 1610.98]  um
[1610.98 --> 1615.30]  Now one of the challenges with that is that obviously they got those talking points from somewhere
[1615.86 --> 1619.94]  So we would be working with a company almost and all of almost all of them do this
[1619.94 --> 1625.38]  We would be working with a company that did actively promote their products in uh in a deceptive way
[1626.10 --> 1628.10]  so
[1628.66 --> 1631.94]  On the other hand it's clearly an important part
[1632.66 --> 1637.14]  Of your online privacy toolkit, which is the way that which is the way that we
[1637.14 --> 1642.10]  Had been positioning it most recently when we were working. Um
[1644.18 --> 1645.62]  When we were working with pia
[1646.66 --> 1646.98]  so
[1648.18 --> 1653.54]  In my opinion as long as your talking points are fine and clear, I think it's okay
[1653.78 --> 1659.78]  A lot of people when they talk about this including some of the people in the chat right now have been spamming links to a
[1660.34 --> 1661.38]  video
[1661.38 --> 1662.26]  um
[1662.26 --> 1666.74]  Whatever i'll just name it. It's a video from tom scott called this video is sponsored by blank vpn
[1666.98 --> 1671.06]  Tom scott's more recent videos are sponsored by a vpn company
[1672.26 --> 1678.82]  And what he was saying in this video is that the the marketing and the talking points are misleading and bad and he was totally right
[1680.10 --> 1685.78]  But he eventually takes the sponsorship from a vpn company and just doesn't have misleading and bad talking points
[1686.34 --> 1693.14]  So it's fine. Uh, and it's funny because there was a lot of brigading against us after he launched that video
[1694.18 --> 1696.18]  And I was kind of sitting here going
[1696.74 --> 1698.74]  What we agree? Yeah
[1701.06 --> 1703.14]  What do you want that was a very frustrating time?
[1704.34 --> 1706.34]  Super frustrating time
[1706.34 --> 1708.34]  Uh because his video was great
[1708.34 --> 1710.34]  um
[1710.34 --> 1712.58]  Yeah, it's a it's a good it's a good point
[1713.30 --> 1714.58]  um
[1714.58 --> 1718.42]  Cool story bro. Yeah, uh, we got you. Yeah, yeah
[1718.42 --> 1722.90]  And to be clear like this is this is this is mostly in the response to the to people
[1724.34 --> 1726.18]  Trying to use it to say that
[1726.74 --> 1730.34]  There should never be any vpn sponsorships and no one should ever use vpn. It's like well hold on
[1730.58 --> 1733.70]  You're swinging too far. The tom scott video didn't swing that far
[1735.46 --> 1739.22]  You're you're swinging beyond where it was going. Yeah, I don't know I um
[1739.22 --> 1744.26]  I don't know. I think I might just be I think I might just be open to
[1744.98 --> 1748.50]  To working with them again like I gotta I look full transparency with you guys
[1748.50 --> 1752.10]  Which always gets me in trouble, which is great, but for better or for worse exciting
[1752.58 --> 1755.78]  Those of you who are the real ones who understand that?
[1756.74 --> 1761.06]  We're being transparent with you and when we are transparent it doesn't mean that you know
[1761.06 --> 1764.02]  We have that much more to hide because that's the stuff he tells us
[1764.02 --> 1766.50]  We're actually just telling you like real talk how we do things here
[1766.90 --> 1769.46]  um vpn sponsorships are
[1770.10 --> 1772.10]  if not the
[1772.10 --> 1777.06]  Most financially impactful they are among the most financially impactful
[1777.86 --> 1780.90]  Out of everyone that we have ever worked with
[1781.54 --> 1784.26]  there's a lot of money in vpns to the point where
[1785.06 --> 1791.22]  We not only considered but even when as far as prototyping our own vpn it worked it was great
[1792.02 --> 1797.94]  Yeah, it was up multiple people were using it like it. It's actually incredibly easy to do
[1798.34 --> 1799.94]  It's not still up is it no
[1800.82 --> 1802.82]  are you sure?
[1802.90 --> 1804.02]  Yes
[1804.82 --> 1808.26]  I had to think for a second, but yeah, I remember it being shut down. All right, just making sure
[1808.26 --> 1811.22]  But I mean you could literally turn it back on in like 10 minutes. Oh my god
[1811.22 --> 1815.94]  Not to the degree that we had it because we actually had like distributed so it was it was it was really cool
[1816.50 --> 1817.70]  Jonathan and aj were like
[1818.42 --> 1822.90]  Really motivated because it seemed like a fun thing to do and they just smashed it. Um
[1823.54 --> 1827.38]  Yeah, it was actually like great. It makes me sad because it was
[1828.74 --> 1830.98]  Very well like thought out implemented done
[1832.02 --> 1837.14]  Future planned all that type of stuff. It was really really well scoped in those those guys did a great job with it
[1837.14 --> 1840.42]  And it just we didn't want to go anywhere because we started talking to
[1841.78 --> 1844.66]  Lawyers and they posed some questions to us about like
[1845.54 --> 1847.86]  You know if you want your stance to be
[1848.58 --> 1853.14]  No disclosure, whatever. Are you okay with these things happening on a service that you run and we were like
[1853.94 --> 1854.42]  uh
[1854.42 --> 1860.58]  No, basically the question was are you okay enabling pedos? Yeah, and we were like nah
[1860.58 --> 1867.06]  I guess we won't make all of the money in the world. It would have been all of the money in the world though. We ran the math
[1869.06 --> 1872.34]  It would have been the world would have run out of money before we would have yeah
[1873.46 --> 1880.42]  Especially with our audience and with the numbers that we know from working with vpn providers in the past it was that we know we could push
[1881.06 --> 1882.18]  it was
[1882.18 --> 1888.10]  Huge even if we retain if I remember correctly if we were able to capture I think it was like 25 percent
[1888.10 --> 1891.06]  Of what we had literally already captured
[1891.78 --> 1894.58]  We would have just been making monster money. Yep
[1895.70 --> 1896.74]  And it's like oh
[1897.54 --> 1898.10]  so then
[1899.38 --> 1901.14]  The question becomes what's the difference?
[1902.98 --> 1904.58]  What is the difference between
[1905.78 --> 1906.58]  us
[1907.46 --> 1915.46]  Making a vpn and making money and us taking the money from companies that are profiting off of sheltering
[1915.46 --> 1917.46]  Ne'er-do-wells?
[1917.46 --> 1919.06]  It is a it is an interesting one
[1919.06 --> 1924.10]  But I think that's a question that you could pose to like almost anything. Yeah, but don't what about isn't it?
[1925.78 --> 1926.42]  You just did
[1927.06 --> 1929.78]  That's what this is. No this question is no
[1930.34 --> 1934.02]  No, no, that's not what about ism. I i'm saying here's something really bad
[1934.34 --> 1938.74]  Yeah, and you're saying well, what about other things that are bad and i'm saying no answer the question
[1938.74 --> 1941.46]  Okay, I think it's I think it's still okay personally
[1942.10 --> 1948.82]  Because you're not you're not telling people hey are you this thing that's really bad use this one. It's good
[1950.58 --> 1955.54]  You're talking about actually in this situation specifically promoting it for piracy, which is
[1958.42 --> 1960.42]  Which is questionable in its own right
[1962.26 --> 1966.74]  And something we would not be able to do if it was our own service just to be super clear
[1966.74 --> 1972.26]  But what we could do is say vpns are for piracy now
[1974.18 --> 1977.14]  And then make our own vpn later but never mention it again
[1978.26 --> 1979.46]  Yeah, I um
[1982.82 --> 1988.98]  Yeah, it's so what is the difference between profiting from it directly and to be clear I actually like have an answer in mind
[1988.98 --> 1992.42]  I'm, not just trying to give you a hard time. I think it's doing the action of of
[1992.42 --> 1995.94]  Of knowing that you're covering the trace for a certain type of people
[1996.10 --> 2000.66]  So I thought that's kind of what I was expecting him to say and I guess I guess the difference is
[2001.22 --> 2002.58]  that
[2002.58 --> 2007.70]  As the owner right because there's no such thing as a completely untraceable connection
[2008.26 --> 2010.42]  It is traced to somewhere
[2011.54 --> 2013.94]  And then it is encrypted, right?
[2014.58 --> 2015.54]  So
[2015.54 --> 2020.34]  So when you're using a vpn it's it's a relay, right? So if there's some server hosting
[2021.22 --> 2022.66]  awful unspeakable
[2022.66 --> 2023.86]  It's not liability
[2023.86 --> 2026.42]  Content no, this is not a this is not a question of liability
[2026.98 --> 2031.22]  There's there's vpns that operate out of canada clearly it can be managed yeah
[2032.02 --> 2038.18]  So so if if there's a server that has some unspeakable image or or
[2038.18 --> 2042.58]  Video or whatever it is on it, right?
[2042.58 --> 2048.98]  And there's a user who's accessing it what the vpn does is it encrypts this leg, right?
[2048.98 --> 2054.74]  So if any traffic monitoring that is happening still shows that unspeakable content
[2055.30 --> 2057.22]  Arriving at your node
[2058.26 --> 2060.10]  So they will come and they will ask you
[2061.06 --> 2063.06]  Where did it go?
[2063.06 --> 2069.46]  And luke lafreniere cto or whatever c-suite like would have to die
[2070.18 --> 2072.18]  Title we give him would have to say
[2073.14 --> 2074.82]  I will not answer that question
[2075.54 --> 2076.90]  I know who they are
[2077.54 --> 2079.22]  Well, no or no logs
[2080.10 --> 2082.66]  Okay, but I could find out
[2083.30 --> 2088.26]  I could do it and I will choose not to I could do something about it dive in front of this person
[2088.50 --> 2089.70]  I will decide
[2089.70 --> 2096.74]  I will decide to not do this to do nothing about it. Yeah to stand idly by yeah
[2097.62 --> 2099.86]  And i'm just like literally not willing to do that. Yeah
[2099.86 --> 2105.38]  So if i'm not willing to do that and we advertise this service that people do use for that
[2106.74 --> 2108.58]  Saying hey, there's no logs
[2109.30 --> 2111.14]  Then we'd have to go against what we were saying
[2111.78 --> 2116.42]  Because i'm not going to say no to that so we're going to have logs and then it's like wait
[2116.42 --> 2120.66]  We said we weren't going to have logs so we can't really run this thing. Yeah
[2121.46 --> 2123.22]  But if someone else runs it we're okay with it
[2124.66 --> 2126.42]  People are going to use it no matter what
[2127.54 --> 2129.62]  If they want to use it and support us neat
[2131.06 --> 2138.26]  And the vast majority of our audience is going to use it for fine probably downloading movies we could promote kitchen knives
[2138.26 --> 2143.46]  People could use them for making food people could also use them for bad things
[2146.02 --> 2153.62]  In the kitchen knife scenario, there's no logging to figure out who used your thing for bad stuff. It's not a perfect analogy. No, it's really not but
[2154.90 --> 2158.34]  Like I don't know you can promote that people use something for good stuff
[2158.98 --> 2160.34]  um is piracy that
[2160.34 --> 2168.66]  Maybe some forms this is going to be the spiciest wanshow ever yeah, I don't know why we're doing this necessarily, but
[2169.22 --> 2174.90]  It's a good conversation. This is a good conversation. It's okay. I think so i'm i'm interested
[2175.78 --> 2179.54]  Let us know is this a good conversation are you guys interested no one's like move on
[2180.58 --> 2185.30]  Like they tell us when they hate what we're talking about there's people talking about drastically unrelated things
[2185.86 --> 2188.82]  Yeah, it's always like that. Yeah, people like this is great
[2189.70 --> 2191.70]  This is how we do here
[2191.86 --> 2198.50]  This is how we make decisions the conversations we have on wanshow are really not that different from the conversations that we have off of wanshow
[2198.50 --> 2204.26]  They're quite related. Yeah, except that y'all are watching it. Yeah, yeah voyeuristic weirdos
[2205.62 --> 2210.90]  Especially the ones that are here live. Do we uh, you can do that to the vpn as well. How do I do that?
[2210.90 --> 2212.90]  How do I how do I show them?
[2213.06 --> 2216.02]  Win cam look at that. We got some winners in the house
[2216.90 --> 2219.38]  Look at the prime seat up front. Wow
[2220.26 --> 2226.82]  That's a glorious position. Uh a while back. We ran a contest draw sweepstakes
[2226.82 --> 2234.02]  I don't know what to call it, but basically it's very comfy people who bought the 3d down jacket one in however many people who purchased it
[2234.50 --> 2236.50]  were eligible for and all
[2236.50 --> 2243.14]  Actually, I don't know if all expenses were paid but definitely the travel definitely the plane and hotel were paid
[2243.14 --> 2247.30]  Uh to come to the headquarters get a tour and uh hang out
[2247.30 --> 2250.10]  They're actually like I could almost spit on them
[2250.10 --> 2254.42]  But I wouldn't because they're above me and it would actually come back because gravity and hit me
[2254.42 --> 2258.90]  Um myself so I would I could spit on myself and almost reach them
[2258.90 --> 2261.14]  Uh, they're like right above us right now
[2261.14 --> 2268.42]  Um, I hope you guys are enjoying the wang show Dan are we doing live q a with these guys live merch messages?
[2268.42 --> 2271.70]  Is that a thing? Yeah, I believe they're gonna come down here and we can hang out
[2272.10 --> 2277.46]  Why don't we do another topic real quick and then we'll we'll bring on one of them for our merch message break after topic two
[2278.10 --> 2280.10]  I think part of it too is
[2280.10 --> 2285.54]  For the service to exist like at all it basically has to harbor bad stuff
[2285.54 --> 2292.82]  So there isn't really getting any any getting around how it has to work
[2293.30 --> 2294.74]  And i'm just not willing to run it
[2295.38 --> 2297.70]  But i've used them relatively extensively
[2298.10 --> 2301.14]  I suggest that other people use them relatively extensively
[2301.14 --> 2304.58]  So if i'm going to do so can i not also recommend one to use?
[2304.58 --> 2307.30]  I think that's fine, but i'm not willing to run it myself
[2308.74 --> 2310.02]  So there you go you know what
[2310.90 --> 2312.90]  Colton if you're watching this
[2313.46 --> 2316.02]  Get pia on the phone doors open yeah
[2317.14 --> 2317.70]  Let's uh
[2319.22 --> 2321.86]  It's fine to me like even when we stopped the sponsorship
[2322.42 --> 2329.86]  I was kind of like i kept using it okay yeah exactly like i haven't canceled like 80 of other creators that have like nord
[2329.86 --> 2335.62]  Sponsorships or whatever they are people aren't just going to find it there and you know what's funny is that what's the difference as far as
[2335.62 --> 2341.62]  I can tell and you know this is this is the more just like cynical business side of me as far as I can tell
[2341.62 --> 2347.78]  Stopping our vpn sponsorships has earned us exactly this much goodwill anyway
[2347.86 --> 2348.26]  Yeah
[2348.98 --> 2354.50]  I I didn't see during any controversy during any kind of kerfuffle
[2355.38 --> 2356.90]  I haven't seen a single
[2358.02 --> 2364.66]  Single person that's gone man. Remember when vpn sponsorships were not cool and
[2365.38 --> 2368.58]  Linus media group didn't take them for literally years
[2370.34 --> 2371.78]  Yeah
[2371.86 --> 2373.94]  And there's lots of other sponsors you've done the same thing for it
[2373.94 --> 2376.02]  So i'm kind of sitting here going like you know whatever
[2376.02 --> 2380.58]  I still i'm not saying that to be very clear just because someone's going to quote that and then yeah
[2380.58 --> 2382.98]  Try to throw me under 18 different buses
[2382.98 --> 2384.66]  I'm not saying that we shouldn't keep doing that
[2385.54 --> 2391.94]  But especially if like we genuinely don't like if yeah, we use vpns it's fine. This one seems fine cool
[2391.94 --> 2394.66]  And then we control the talking points what
[2395.78 --> 2400.90]  At this point, I think we're only doing it because people like asked us not to which is like whatever man
[2401.70 --> 2401.94]  Yeah
[2402.66 --> 2407.78]  If if we're gonna stop a sponsorship with someone because their customer support is super bad and we've had a lot of
[2408.18 --> 2410.26]  uh, you know our own user base
[2411.14 --> 2415.46]  Report that as an issue and we try to follow up on it and we haven't seen any good improvements
[2415.46 --> 2418.58]  Obviously every company is going to have some customer support issues here or there
[2418.58 --> 2423.06]  But like it's it's at unreasonable levels or we find that their product is not set
[2423.62 --> 2427.54]  Satisfactory enough for whatever reason whatever else like there's there's reasons why we cancel sponsorships
[2427.70 --> 2429.94]  There's reasons why we don't do certain things that's cool
[2429.94 --> 2432.90]  We should keep doing that but like if this was a goodwill move
[2433.46 --> 2437.78]  Yeah, I don't think it mattered anyways. No, I don't think it made any difference whatsoever
[2441.54 --> 2443.54]  I don't think we're going back to tunnel bear though
[2443.54 --> 2447.38]  Yeah, see but there was a reason suggesting yeah, yeah, yeah, like so like
[2449.30 --> 2454.42]  But pi is still around they seem fine. I haven't heard anything bad. I don't know. They were acquired by cape
[2454.74 --> 2460.74]  um, okay, and cape has has a cape has had a complicated history, okay?
[2460.74 --> 2465.78]  I think is probably the most generous possible stuff in years. I don't know me neither. Yeah
[2465.78 --> 2467.62]  Um, I have we should dip our toes back in
[2467.62 --> 2472.02]  I have no idea what cape is up to these days. I have no idea what nord's been up to lately
[2472.66 --> 2478.02]  A lot of people in chat are saying I'm I'm I use pia. I use pia lots blah blah blah
[2478.02 --> 2480.26]  It's like yeah, but we promoted pia for years as well
[2480.26 --> 2484.26]  So probably a lot of them that might be why they just still have the subscription. Yep, so
[2486.26 --> 2488.26]  Man now I wish we had the uh
[2490.34 --> 2497.06]  Yeah, top gear 1224 is like cancelling asus was wild after they paid for ltx so that's a perfect example
[2497.06 --> 2501.14]  Of how a I haven't seen anyone credit a we
[2501.14 --> 2505.86]  Don't earn goodwill when we do things the community calls for we just
[2506.34 --> 2509.94]  Get people mad at us when we don't do whatever they demand and be
[2510.58 --> 2512.10]  How the community does not?
[2513.14 --> 2517.54]  Understand how things work behind the scenes here and whenever they
[2518.58 --> 2523.70]  Make whenever they draw conclusions based on their understanding almost invariably
[2523.70 --> 2529.14]  Variably the conclusion is wrong because their understanding is wrong. Asus didn't pay for ltx
[2529.94 --> 2532.42]  The attendees paid for ltx
[2533.14 --> 2535.14]  Like the the amount of speculation
[2535.70 --> 2539.22]  That asus had us under their thumb because of the sponsor
[2539.22 --> 2539.78]  Well, okay
[2539.78 --> 2543.94]  Like they they're they're a major sponsor. I might be able to add some context there. Yeah, sure
[2543.94 --> 2545.30]  Uh, the amount
[2546.34 --> 2547.54]  You guys charged
[2548.18 --> 2552.74]  Is not in line with other conventions that i've seen for booths for
[2553.46 --> 2558.34]  Sponsored uh like title sponsors for anything like that the amount of income coming from those things was like
[2559.86 --> 2566.66]  Orders of magnitude lower than the numbers that I know from certain people that run other certain conventions like way way way way way lower
[2566.74 --> 2568.26]  even even considering
[2568.82 --> 2572.18]  Uh, like differences in attendance rates and stuff like that sure like it's
[2572.18 --> 2576.10]  It's and there's reasons for that because linus was super and i'm not against this
[2576.26 --> 2578.98]  I'm pointing at you because it was your idea, but I actually I liked it
[2579.22 --> 2581.86]  But linus was super militant about like if you have a booth
[2581.86 --> 2584.50]  There has to be something cool there that people can do and all this kind of stuff
[2584.50 --> 2588.74]  So the convention was really fun because you run you walk into all these conventions that are just like uh
[2590.02 --> 2594.02]  It's basically just a bunch of stores or a bunch of like info booths that aren't very interesting
[2594.02 --> 2595.78]  So we want it to be more interactive and cool
[2595.94 --> 2601.22]  But doing that meant that a lot of these big players that go and spend big money at these shows
[2601.22 --> 2605.86]  We're not really interested because they have a booth that they bring to shows all year
[2606.10 --> 2609.86]  It does one thing and they don't want to make it do a special thing just for this one show
[2610.18 --> 2612.18]  So we didn't capture a lot of that but
[2612.82 --> 2616.50]  I think that's probably where some assumption comes from is often those title sponsors are like
[2617.38 --> 2618.02]  big money
[2618.90 --> 2620.90]  Really big money. Well, that's fair enough
[2621.06 --> 2625.86]  Um top gear says whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn't say that I was just saying cancelling a headline sponsor type profile
[2625.86 --> 2628.02]  No, no, I'm not I don't I'm not meaning to call you out or anything
[2628.42 --> 2630.82]  I'm just saying that people generally do not
[2631.70 --> 2637.46]  Do not understand um the dynamics at play here and it wasn't you but it was a lot of people
[2638.50 --> 2644.42]  When when asus was under fire uh for their handling of particularly some some warranty issues
[2644.82 --> 2648.34]  There were a lot of people saying well ltt is not going to say anything because
[2648.34 --> 2654.18]  There there is no tech brand that we're not willing to
[2655.14 --> 2657.14]  speak out against
[2657.46 --> 2661.46]  And there's a reason that major tech brands either
[2662.26 --> 2664.82]  Don't work with us for years at a time
[2664.82 --> 2668.34]  We didn't work with nvidia for over two years on a sponsored basis
[2668.66 --> 2672.98]  They begrudgingly especially at first later on things were a lot smoother
[2672.98 --> 2679.06]  But at first they begrudgingly seated us cards for reviews just so that we could do our basic coverage of them
[2679.06 --> 2685.06]  That was it there are major tech brands that simply do not talk to us at all
[2685.06 --> 2687.06]  We're not in this industry to make friends
[2687.30 --> 2689.06]  Apple has my digits
[2689.06 --> 2694.82]  I know they do because i've exchanged emails with a rep one time when they needed something from me
[2695.38 --> 2697.70]  Every other time that i've reached out to them they have
[2698.50 --> 2700.50]  explicitly ignored it
[2700.50 --> 2702.50]  um so
[2704.74 --> 2706.42]  Consider who you're going after
[2707.30 --> 2712.74]  If it's if it's you know the corruption you're trying to root out if it's the people who play the game
[2714.74 --> 2717.54]  We've shown time and time and time again
[2719.86 --> 2724.10]  We're willing to stand behind what we say we're willing to stand behind what we believe um
[2726.10 --> 2730.26]  Where was the thing two two quick things on the convention topic if you want to look into
[2730.26 --> 2735.70]  booth prices something that's very interesting is battle state games to people that run tarkov are
[2736.58 --> 2740.42]  incorporated in the uk or something instead of russia and
[2741.62 --> 2745.22]  That means all of their corporate documents and finances and stuff are public
[2745.78 --> 2747.38]  You can look up how much they spend on booths
[2747.94 --> 2753.14]  It will blow your freaking mind really i'm talking like half a million dollars a show sometimes wow
[2753.46 --> 2755.54]  Like okay, yeah, we were not getting that kind of money. No
[2755.54 --> 2759.54]  They're also going on stuff like gamescom sure but like
[2761.30 --> 2766.98]  Yeah, huge huge money in booths. Um, also, uh, i'm going to open sauce
[2767.54 --> 2771.62]  Come say hi. It's gonna be really fun. I'm doing a panel and i'll be hanging out during the show
[2773.22 --> 2775.22]  I realize I haven't told anyone all right
[2775.22 --> 2779.62]  One more about to get us canceled topic nice. Let's go
[2780.42 --> 2786.18]  You organize your welches. Is that the topic? No, um, that's not going to get me canceled. They all have ocd anyway
[2787.22 --> 2787.62]  um
[2788.82 --> 2793.30]  That I i've made a grid out of my gummy candies here. You can't really see it because it's behind my perfectly
[2793.70 --> 2795.70]  They're all in the same direction linus has
[2795.70 --> 2796.82]  color
[2796.82 --> 2801.22]  This is a this is a good thing all right
[2802.10 --> 2808.58]  A small distraction over on floatplane asks is there ever an ethical gambling sponsorship adults can choose their vices
[2810.02 --> 2810.82]  like basically
[2811.78 --> 2814.26]  The question is if it's legal
[2815.22 --> 2820.90]  Why are we taking some kind of moral high ground here? It's something people enjoy it's something that has made its way into
[2821.70 --> 2825.46]  mainstream acceptance especially over the last five to ten years
[2826.26 --> 2833.38]  What's our problem? Why don't we just get the bag is i'm and i'm i'm expanding on the question a little bit obviously here, but
[2835.14 --> 2840.74]  Thinking of my my immediate jump to would go extreme levels of mental manipulation in order to ruin your life
[2841.78 --> 2842.58]  um
[2842.58 --> 2846.42]  And I think that's like genuinely the main goal of the entire thing
[2847.46 --> 2850.58]  I don't think there's a positive to it literally at all ever
[2851.38 --> 2853.38]  the only person i have ever seen
[2854.34 --> 2858.74]  That has had a healthy relationship with it was uh john martin actually
[2859.62 --> 2865.62]  Um and hit the way that he would do it was writer. Yeah, he would leave anything was john martin john martin still exists
[2865.62 --> 2866.50]  and still works here
[2866.50 --> 2867.06]  yeah, yeah
[2867.06 --> 2867.86]  um
[2867.86 --> 2868.82]  He uh
[2868.82 --> 2870.90]  Still cool. I meant because this is the story
[2870.90 --> 2874.26]  Christmas he looks great. Yeah, he actually does. Yeah, he's doing good
[2874.66 --> 2875.06]  um
[2875.06 --> 2877.30]  But anyway, he would leave any way of
[2877.86 --> 2879.94]  Increasing the amount of funds on hand at home
[2880.66 --> 2884.50]  Go with a fixed amount of money and he enjoyed the process so to him
[2884.50 --> 2887.14]  He was like i'll bring as much as I would take to go see a movie
[2887.78 --> 2890.58]  I'll get free food because they give you free food when you're there
[2890.58 --> 2895.94]  I'll play some games until i'm out of money or when I get a reasonable amount and feel like i'm happy and then i'll go home
[2895.94 --> 2900.26]  And then that is like I am accepting an entertainment expense for the night
[2900.66 --> 2904.18]  And there is no way for me to extend it. I respected that that seemed fine
[2904.58 --> 2904.82]  um
[2907.30 --> 2910.18]  The positives the winnings you know you don't get it man
[2910.18 --> 2915.46]  No, that's not you don't win the house always wins. Yeah, everybody knows that
[2915.46 --> 2919.38]  Yeah, sorry, dude, and like I appreciate your full-play subscriber all that kind of stuff, but like
[2920.26 --> 2921.38]  You're that's not
[2922.18 --> 2923.78]  You you lose
[2923.78 --> 2929.46]  That's how that works and you is not necessarily you personally. Yeah, you you is the personally
[2931.06 --> 2933.06]  Might have that one time
[2933.22 --> 2934.74]  unprecedented streak of luck
[2935.54 --> 2937.06]  but you collectively
[2938.02 --> 2939.94]  definitely mathematically
[2940.66 --> 2941.94]  lose
[2941.94 --> 2943.94]  yeah
[2943.94 --> 2948.42]  And like man the problem the problem with saying the upsides is the winnings. Yeah
[2948.98 --> 2951.38]  Is you just wholeheartedly accepting?
[2951.94 --> 2956.58]  The upside is the mental manipulation that is going to eventually rip all my money away
[2957.22 --> 2962.18]  And like one i've talked about you're taking the dopamine loop that they want you to take which is bad
[2962.18 --> 2968.66]  I've talked about this on the wan show before but like a big moment for me was just walking around in las vegas for the first time
[2968.66 --> 2973.30]  Every like man those the bathrooms
[2973.86 --> 2974.74]  Are so clean?
[2975.70 --> 2979.30]  Like you could eat off them. They're huge the ceilings are
[2979.78 --> 2986.26]  30 feet high and and painted like the sky like it's like every every every inch of it
[2986.26 --> 2989.30]  Every brick that was laid was laid with money
[2989.30 --> 2996.74]  They're doing everything they possibly can to communicate to you that you will lose and horrifically
[2996.74 --> 2999.22]  And this is how much you're gonna give us
[3000.50 --> 3002.50]  Not you personally necessarily
[3003.14 --> 3005.14]  You're walking into the mouth of a demon
[3005.38 --> 3006.50]  You collectively
[3006.50 --> 3010.10]  Are here to enrich us this?
[3010.90 --> 3011.30]  much
[3011.30 --> 3013.14]  and
[3013.14 --> 3015.30]  Even if you win guess what?
[3015.94 --> 3019.46]  We're gonna fill this place with fine food and
[3020.18 --> 3023.30]  Products that are also going to give you a dopamine hit and
[3023.94 --> 3027.54]  Activities which to be clear. I have no problem with activities the point is fun
[3027.62 --> 3031.14]  We're gonna fill this place with all this stuff so that even when you win
[3031.14 --> 3036.90]  You're gonna spend it easy come easy go you're gonna spend it. Oh, guess what on?
[3036.90 --> 3043.14]  Establishments within our buildings that we own that funnel that money back to us in the form of rent
[3043.54 --> 3049.14]  The whole thing is designed where even if you walk out of las vegas up
[3050.02 --> 3051.78]  $200 after you spent
[3052.74 --> 3058.18]  You know a hundred of it on let's say a necklace or something they are still
[3058.90 --> 3061.06]  They are still gonna keep some of your money there
[3062.34 --> 3064.74]  So why don't we take gambling sponsorships?
[3065.22 --> 3067.22]  because
[3067.94 --> 3070.34]  Neither luke nor I believe it has
[3073.22 --> 3080.34]  I used to I used to work at any reason to promote it. Yeah, we we don't I used to work at the bread factory and
[3081.06 --> 3083.06]  there was
[3083.14 --> 3086.34]  I'm not saying dudes there because there was only men there
[3086.34 --> 3090.42]  I'm saying dudes there because I actually don't think any of the women had negative gambling problems
[3090.98 --> 3092.26]  only the guys did so
[3092.82 --> 3093.86]  l men but
[3094.74 --> 3100.98]  There was many times and many different people that people would come into work and you'd hear them like begging for extra
[3100.98 --> 3104.82]  Hours and you try to figure out what's going on and it turns out that they yet again
[3105.38 --> 3107.38]  Gambled their rent away
[3108.02 --> 3109.70]  And are worried about becoming homeless
[3110.34 --> 3112.18]  They could have easily afforded their rent
[3112.90 --> 3117.54]  They were doing fine. We made pretty good money at that point in time. I knew these people. I knew they were doing okay
[3117.54 --> 3120.10]  They were living within means everything was okay, but they gambled away
[3120.50 --> 3122.50]  They lost it and then they'll oh
[3123.62 --> 3129.70]  Almost you know lost everything one more double or nothing. That was rough and then a few months later the same thing happens
[3130.34 --> 3134.58]  Because you're you're being mentally manipulated. You're being controlled like just don't
[3135.30 --> 3140.42]  Allow this to happen and don't feed into it and yeah, I don't know. I probably it's so bad
[3140.42 --> 3144.50]  I'd probably promote alcohol and cigarettes before I'd promote gambling speaking of vices, right?
[3144.50 --> 3147.62]  Like you were saying let people pick their vices they're adults and that's fair enough
[3147.94 --> 3152.74]  And you know what like to Luke's point some people can have a healthy relationship
[3153.06 --> 3155.30]  I actually fully respect John's approach
[3155.94 --> 3159.30]  I had not met someone with a healthy relationship
[3159.30 --> 3162.90]  And you're gonna your brains just about gonna fall out of your head
[3163.22 --> 3166.74]  I had not met someone with a healthy relationship with smoking
[3167.62 --> 3169.70]  Until I met one of my badminton friends
[3171.70 --> 3173.70]  She will light up one cigarette
[3174.66 --> 3175.70]  like
[3175.78 --> 3176.98]  once a quarter
[3177.62 --> 3179.78]  Just be like I like this
[3179.86 --> 3182.82]  I like to enjoy it once in a while and then we'll just
[3183.78 --> 3184.98]  not smoke for
[3184.98 --> 3191.22]  A month two months three months. I mean I still think it's bad, but it's not good for you
[3191.78 --> 3193.06]  But it's not gonna kill them
[3195.78 --> 3203.54]  Four cigarettes a year is not gonna kill someone luke inhaling smoke is just bad sure but you'd probably be worse off sitting around the campfire all summer
[3203.70 --> 3205.70]  That's very true
[3205.70 --> 3210.50]  That's why I hesitated a little bit. I was like there's a lot worse things. Let's be real here. Yeah, I mean it's
[3210.50 --> 3212.50]  I
[3213.94 --> 3215.86]  I mean it's not as bad as like chain smoking
[3219.14 --> 3223.30]  So I don't know it's one of those things where it's like yeah you can have a just
[3224.26 --> 3229.94]  There's really weird arguments you can make about the upsides of nicotine and things get really odd when you start going down that path
[3229.94 --> 3234.58]  But then there's there's much healthier ways to ingest nicotine if you're going for the
[3235.22 --> 3236.10]  the
[3236.10 --> 3239.30]  positive effects that it does have even though it does have really addictive properties all this other
[3239.30 --> 3241.30]  like it gets really messy, but
[3242.02 --> 3244.02]  yeah
[3244.02 --> 3246.02]  So it's one of those things to be clear
[3246.02 --> 3252.82]  Man, some people seem confused. We are not going to be promoting smoking or alcohol. No, no, no, no, that's not the point
[3254.10 --> 3254.42]  uh
[3254.42 --> 3256.58]  the point is just that
[3256.66 --> 3258.66]  it kind of doesn't matter because
[3259.22 --> 3263.78]  these are things that in general are designed to
[3264.74 --> 3265.78]  end trap
[3265.78 --> 3268.26]  uh to be addictive they're designed to
[3268.26 --> 3272.98]  Not necessarily they're designed to but they hurt you
[3272.98 --> 3278.50]  Yeah, and you know what? I think we make a bit of an exception for like mobile games for example
[3279.06 --> 3281.46]  Our line is that it has to be fun without paying
[3282.10 --> 3284.10]  um
[3284.10 --> 3286.10]  That's a pretty good line in my opinion
[3286.10 --> 3290.74]  Because there are mobile games that are fun. There are mobile games that are free that are fun
[3290.74 --> 3292.74]  Um, I like pokemon go
[3292.74 --> 3297.78]  I don't engage with it in a way that I feel like it is being predatory to me. I think it's fine
[3298.26 --> 3302.58]  I saw oh, I saw I saw one comment a little while back and unfortunately I
[3303.70 --> 3304.42]  I uh
[3304.42 --> 3307.46]  I lost it, but it was it was it was a good one
[3307.46 --> 3314.74]  Someone was basically like yeah gambling is fine if it's you and your buds playing poker and you know that if you lost your buddy won
[3315.14 --> 3316.26]  100%
[3316.26 --> 3318.98]  That's a totally different thing. I've got no problem with that
[3318.98 --> 3322.02]  If there was if there was gamble with your friends.com
[3322.66 --> 3325.14]  And their model was that they took like
[3325.86 --> 3327.30]  Let's say
[3327.30 --> 3333.22]  1% off the top or something like that because realistically a lot of the odds are are kind of like that anyway
[3333.22 --> 3334.26]  but
[3334.26 --> 3337.06]  the house was never just like
[3338.18 --> 3342.82]  Like like blackjack, right like the house was never just like taking all of someone's money
[3344.18 --> 3350.10]  I honestly think I could I could maybe accept that what would it even would it what would it it would just support poker?
[3350.10 --> 3354.26]  Is that correct? Sure, or just any anything where you are betting with
[3355.38 --> 3359.86]  Well, no, we can't enforce that. It's with people's friends. We can't enforce that relationship. Yeah
[3359.86 --> 3364.50]  Yeah, and then it just becomes a poker website. Yeah, okay. Well
[3365.38 --> 3366.50]  Hypothetically
[3366.50 --> 3368.50]  Right in a perfect, you know
[3369.38 --> 3378.98]  Imaginary utopia if there was gamble with your friends.com and it was the online equivalent of just you're all busy and don't have time to gather around that
[3379.38 --> 3382.34]  Stereotypical round table just off to the side in the kitchen
[3382.34 --> 3386.50]  Right. I know that some people don't like playing things like poker when there is no
[3387.14 --> 3393.78]  Uh stakes in this case the easiest one is probably financial, but some people will do other things and that's fine
[3394.10 --> 3399.78]  But uh, they don't play like playing it when there is none because people just like go all in every hand and like not really take it
[3399.78 --> 3403.86]  Very seriously. So you kind of want something on the line so people play it more seriously. That's all fine
[3404.02 --> 3407.22]  You do that with your buddies in the comfort of your own home, whatever
[3407.70 --> 3411.62]  Personally, I don't care at all go have fun. Um, it's it's the
[3411.62 --> 3416.82]  Yeah, it's the it's the more corporatized gambling. That's a problem
[3418.42 --> 3421.86]  I'm even like I I generally don't take bets of like almost any kind
[3423.94 --> 3424.26]  Lunch
[3424.26 --> 3431.54]  I'll do lunch. Yeah, but then that's like the result of this bet is we go hang out. Yes, which is like yeah
[3431.54 --> 3435.94]  Everybody wins. Yeah, exactly. I'm totally cool with those but like hey, I'll bet you
[3435.94 --> 3440.58]  I'll bet you 50 bucks that this team is going to beat this other team and insert sports game
[3440.58 --> 3443.14]  Like I have no interest in that at all. I don't know
[3443.14 --> 3445.14]  I don't know
[3448.58 --> 3453.62]  $20 buy-in no rebuy. Yeah, see like that seems decently healthy to me as long as everyone can afford it
[3453.62 --> 3458.66]  You might not have a friend that can so that gets a little weird uncle charlie mt volunteer fire department
[3458.82 --> 3463.22]  People hung around and played poker if you lost 20 bucks. You went home. Nobody wanted mad wives
[3464.10 --> 3470.74]  Nice see that seems pretty good. That's probably okay. Yeah, but there's no way to enforce that with an online service totally
[3470.74 --> 3473.46]  Yeah, I just don't see I don't see how we could get involved in that
[3474.02 --> 3477.30]  It's incredible how much money there isn't it though like absolutely
[3478.10 --> 3484.66]  Wild ah hey speaking of things that are incredible how much money is in them. Thank you so much for supporting us realttstore.com
[3484.98 --> 3488.42]  We are going to do some merch messages ladies and gentle folk
[3490.42 --> 3494.90]  The way merch messages work is all you got to do is instead of just throwing money at your screen randomly
[3494.90 --> 3499.46]  Like you normally would on youtube or twitch or whatever else you can throw money at
[3499.46 --> 3503.70]  Lttstore.com all you got to do is add one of our fabulous
[3504.18 --> 3510.18]  Products to your cart and a little here. Let's go. We'll check out our zip up at mock neck
[3511.70 --> 3515.54]  Look how stylish tiny looks okay available in up to triple xl
[3516.26 --> 3521.14]  We're going to add that to the cart and any time we the dark colored undershirt that actually works really well
[3521.46 --> 3524.74]  Anytime we are live there will be a merch message banner here
[3524.74 --> 3529.46]  So you can decide whether to make an anonymous or show your first and last name you can leave us a little message
[3529.86 --> 3531.86]  You can even pick your color
[3532.90 --> 3536.02]  How cute is that and it will go to producer dan?
[3536.26 --> 3542.18]  There he is who will curate your message for me and luke or respond to it himself or forward it to the appropriate person or just
[3542.66 --> 3546.34]  Blast it up on the bottom of the screen for everyone to admire
[3546.42 --> 3551.22]  And the best thing about merch messages is you can throw your money at the screen in order to interact with the show and
[3551.22 --> 3556.02]  even if we don't get to it or you know your answer is something that we
[3556.50 --> 3561.78]  Can't answer or whatever else it is you will still get your fantastic merchandise in the mail
[3562.02 --> 3565.54]  We've got a couple of new things that we are promoting on the store this week
[3566.26 --> 3572.18]  We are launching two new apparel items. We've got the pocket t-shirt and zip up mock neck
[3572.18 --> 3576.82]  So I showed you guys the zip up mock neck already. It looks great
[3577.78 --> 3579.14]  obviously
[3579.14 --> 3582.50]  Zipper pocket got the little subtle LTT branding
[3583.22 --> 3585.22]  How sharp does everybody look?
[3585.22 --> 3588.90]  YKK zipper of course because we are all about that quality
[3589.70 --> 3592.98]  The only thing that I don't like about our stealth branding in general
[3592.98 --> 3594.82]  I love it and I want it for myself
[3594.98 --> 3598.02]  The only thing I don't like is sometimes when I'm like driving to work and stuff
[3598.02 --> 3602.58]  I'll notice someone walking down the street wearing like a sweater with the backpack or something. I'm like hey cool
[3602.98 --> 3604.90]  And now I can't tell yeah
[3605.46 --> 3613.22]  Well, okay, that's fair. We're good quality stuff. Luke. We're gonna have something coming for you nice. It's gonna be very recognizable
[3614.34 --> 3620.98]  Very out there. I hope it's just your face. No, it will not be that. Do you remember the what was the dentist shirt?
[3620.98 --> 3622.98]  Dennis
[3624.18 --> 3628.66]  Oh, it's so good. We've also got our new pocket t-shirt. It's a t-shirt now
[3629.46 --> 3637.46]  With featuring pocket infinity percent more pocket. Whoa. Yeah, that's right. Look at that pocket boom right there

[3644.58 --> 3650.50]  Blue, I mean, I'm sure we've got slate. Yeah, we've probably got some fancy name for yes slate. That's a cool name for it slate
[3650.50 --> 3651.54]  I like that

[3684.90 --> 3688.34]  So yeah, okay. I think uh, this is connor, right? Yes
[3688.34 --> 3691.86]  Connor and we've got some questions perfect. Thanks guys
[3692.82 --> 3696.90]  What I wanted to ask was whatever happened to ice giant cooling
[3697.62 --> 3700.50]  Any updates on the next version of the pro siphon elite?
[3700.50 --> 3705.86]  Now that traditional air coolers and on uh, all-in-ones are so effective and cheap
[3706.74 --> 3708.74]  uh, did they miss the market opportunity?
[3708.74 --> 3718.82]  Good question in terms of what happened to them. I don't think that anything in particular has happened to them other than that they
[3719.54 --> 3722.34]  made a really cool really innovative product
[3723.06 --> 3724.34]  and
[3724.34 --> 3727.30]  Unfortunately, oh am I muted? I gotcha. Oh
[3727.30 --> 3731.46]  I I I don't think anything in particular has happened to them
[3732.02 --> 3736.90]  Insofar as I don't think they've gone out of business or anything the last time they showed up on my radar
[3736.90 --> 3741.14]  Someone on the forum messaged uh or messaged me or posted publicly
[3741.14 --> 3745.38]  I can't remember but I was paying attention to this this discussion that was taking place
[3745.94 --> 3750.02]  And they had an issue where they had lost their mounting hardware
[3750.42 --> 3754.42]  And they weren't able to mount it to their new upgraded computer, right?
[3754.42 --> 3757.94]  Because they were using one set and then they needed a new set ultimately
[3758.90 --> 3762.58]  I think the resolution to that was that ice giant did
[3763.22 --> 3765.54]  Get them a replacement mounting kit. So
[3766.10 --> 3770.74]  Evidently they still exist. Uh, luke is on their site right now. Yeah, and they have a
[3770.74 --> 3776.18]  Add to cart product page. They have listings on their product page for three different things two of them are in stock ones out of stock
[3776.18 --> 3778.34]  It looks like a real site. It's running through shopify. So
[3778.34 --> 3780.34]  So they're they're active there
[3780.34 --> 3788.42]  But the challenge for their product is that the problem that it solves is not necessarily one that most
[3789.22 --> 3790.26]  people have
[3790.26 --> 3796.82]  So they came along at what seemed like a really good time when threadripper 5000 and
[3796.82 --> 3801.94]  And subsequent generations of threadripper were looking like we were going to have this need
[3802.50 --> 3805.86]  for coolers that were not just able to
[3806.98 --> 3808.98]  Get the heat away from the cpu
[3809.38 --> 3815.54]  But were able to dissipate that heat to the air around them because that's the advantage of the thermosyphon, right?
[3815.86 --> 3821.46]  Is that it does an incredible job of drawing a colossal amount of heat
[3821.46 --> 3830.42]  And distributing it to the fins so that it can dissipate it to the air and it doesn't it doesn't suffer from the same bottlenecks that heat pipes do
[3831.54 --> 3833.54]  But the problem with that is
[3833.62 --> 3840.98]  That it's only really effective when you have a heat source that is outputting a ton of heat
[3841.38 --> 3848.50]  And the thing about a lot of modern cpus now that amd pays absolutely no attention to consumer threadripper whatsoever
[3848.50 --> 3856.50]  Like we got what we got these like super high priced threadripper and threadripper pro 7000 chips
[3856.50 --> 3856.98]  Yeah
[3857.30 --> 3859.30]  A year a year and a half
[3859.94 --> 3864.66]  Into the zen for life cycle like are you are you kidding me right now?
[3865.22 --> 3870.82]  Um, if i'm an enthusiast what did I did I wait that long to be on the latest architecture like come on
[3870.82 --> 3877.30]  Are you kidding me? Right? So realistically, this is something professional users are using the thermal challenges have been solved
[3877.30 --> 3878.10]  Um
[3879.14 --> 3884.58]  The people who are actually running these things overclocked to the point where they really need to avoid
[3885.06 --> 3885.54]  um
[3885.54 --> 3891.38]  overwhelming their heat pipes in order to get the heat away from the chips like who are these people and then on the intel side
[3892.10 --> 3894.26]  They're still using monolithic dies, right?
[3894.26 --> 3899.14]  They're still using and when I say monolithic I mean single I don't mean that they're actually big right
[3899.14 --> 3902.98]  They're still using these single dies where the bottleneck is not
[3904.10 --> 3907.22]  How much heat can we dissipate to the air?
[3907.62 --> 3913.86]  Like an nhd 15 is more than adequate to dissipate the 350 watts that you'll get out of a
[3914.50 --> 3914.98]  4900k
[3914.98 --> 3922.90]  The problem is that that heat is coming from such a concentrated tiny area that you can't get it away from there fast enough
[3922.90 --> 3926.34]  I mean, that's why you see intel actually we didn't talk about this on wancho
[3927.06 --> 3932.18]  Intel is allowing system integrators to ship their cpus delidded now
[3932.82 --> 3935.78]  Select system integrators are shipping delidded
[3936.58 --> 3941.14]  Top tier intel cpus. That's actually insane. Yeah, that blows my freaking mind with warranty
[3942.42 --> 3948.02]  Yeah, that's wild. I know right. That's not something I would have seen that we're going back to the bear die
[3948.02 --> 3954.50]  Yeah, like what year is it? 2003? That's not the intel had IHS is even then so
[3955.30 --> 3959.38]  My my point is that I don't think ice giant has gone anywhere
[3960.50 --> 3963.94]  So much as ice giants necessity of their product
[3964.50 --> 3970.18]  Has gone somewhere if we were getting regular updates for threadripper at a reasonable price and we had these large
[3970.74 --> 3974.26]  Chips where the challenge is how do we get all the heat?
[3974.26 --> 3978.18]  Heat dissipated to the air then I think there'd be a huge market for it
[3978.42 --> 3985.38]  But as it is on the intel side you got this tiny die and the thermosyphon does nothing to help with that and on the amd side
[3986.18 --> 3990.82]  There's no point overclocking their ryzen non threadripper chips. Anyway, what are you gonna do?
[3992.10 --> 3994.10]  Like get another
[3994.10 --> 3996.10]  50 megahertz out of it
[3996.10 --> 4000.26]  You can't even you can't even really push them beyond their power limit not really I mean you
[4000.26 --> 4006.42]  Obviously if you're an extreme overclocker, you're modifying the board. Yeah, exactly. I brought it to not interested
[4008.74 --> 4010.98]  Where where's my where Luke muted?
[4011.94 --> 4013.94]  Got him
[4013.94 --> 4015.06]  Yeah, I did
[4015.06 --> 4019.30]  Did you give me a fake button Dan? No, I just am bad at my job
[4020.98 --> 4027.30]  Oh, there it goes. Oh, I see it's I accidentally picked the same one that chooses a wide cam. How dare you?
[4027.30 --> 4032.42]  That makes sense. How dare you give me a fake Luke? No, you just push it until it turns red. You're fine. Sorry, Dan
[4035.06 --> 4039.94]  What what is happening? No, no, I'm just actually incompetent. It's just pushing until it turns red
[4040.58 --> 4045.14]  I appreciate you diving under that bus. I got you. All right. Good question. Thank you
[4045.14 --> 4048.74]  Yeah, no, I know they were talking about a copper version forever
[4048.74 --> 4053.94]  And I was just curious you just you never heard anything about it and it just makes me wonder
[4054.50 --> 4056.90]  What kind of they're gonna be doing in the future?
[4056.90 --> 4060.42]  I mean look it's even when you have a really successful product
[4060.58 --> 4068.10]  It's really tough to to maintain the kind of revenues that you need to support R&D to build another product
[4068.66 --> 4070.82]  Screwdriver you're supporting any other people
[4071.38 --> 4077.06]  Screwdriver has been colossally successful for us. We've sold over 130,000 screwdrivers now
[4077.06 --> 4082.50]  You know, that's pretty easy math to do you guys you can you can do it at home on your calculatrice
[4084.18 --> 4088.90]  But these days, I mean we are down to moving compared to what we did at launch, right?
[4089.38 --> 4094.34]  We are now moving in a month what we might have done in an hour on launch day, right?
[4094.34 --> 4096.34]  Like it's not it's not on the same scale
[4096.90 --> 4102.58]  And you have to continue to evolve the product and innovate you have to continue to support all the people who are out there
[4102.58 --> 4106.66]  Owning the product already and who are you know contacting you a year later?
[4106.66 --> 4108.66]  Hey, I'm having this issue or whatever the case may be
[4108.66 --> 4111.14]  There's a lot of overhead involved in running a business
[4111.62 --> 4116.74]  And so you know, that's why you see the really successful companies like the corsairs of the world go out
[4116.74 --> 4120.18]  And they're looking for a new vertical to attack pretty much
[4120.90 --> 4126.74]  Every year whether it's cases or power supplies or peripherals or streaming or whatever
[4126.74 --> 4134.02]  Those guys are doing freaking everything now and there's a reason for it because if you're not growing your product portfolio
[4134.58 --> 4138.58]  It's actually really really hard to sustain your business
[4138.74 --> 4142.26]  There's only so much innovation that you can do on a cooler. You could make a copper one
[4143.06 --> 4150.02]  Sure, but I mean I can tell you right now based on what I know about the differences in the thermal characteristics of aluminum and copper
[4150.02 --> 4156.50]  That copper cooler was going to be a degree or or three better and it was going to cost so much more that
[4157.38 --> 4160.82]  Realistically very few people were going to spring for the copper one looked sick
[4161.38 --> 4162.50]  I know right
[4162.50 --> 4164.50]  It looked really good. I know
[4165.06 --> 4169.70]  All right, Dan do you want to hit us with a digital merch message? Oh, okay. Thank you so much
[4170.58 --> 4171.70]  Let's have a look
[4172.90 --> 4175.78]  Okay, uh, hey a little
[4175.78 --> 4183.86]  Got a new job as a usb test engineer and i've almost convinced my supervisor to buy the 15 000 cable tester you guys reviewed
[4184.34 --> 4190.18]  What are the coolest tests lab has coming up in your opinion? I kind of wish we could ask some questions back
[4191.06 --> 4197.14]  I know right we know who they are could email them. We're actually upgrading our cable tester. So, uh
[4198.10 --> 4201.78]  That's gonna be something buy our used one because you know that we're work
[4201.78 --> 4208.90]  Well, I think we're still going to be using the one we have but we're going to need an upgraded one when we work on our cables because
[4209.54 --> 4211.30]  We want to validate them for
[4212.02 --> 4212.90]  um
[4212.90 --> 4217.46]  Data rates that our current cable tester is not capable of handling makes sense
[4218.02 --> 4220.02]  that's gonna be a
[4220.34 --> 4224.50]  Somewhat recurring expense, I guess I think probably the coolest
[4225.22 --> 4230.58]  Thing I don't know everything's cool. Those guys are working on so much cool stuff. I really cool one that I saw is this
[4231.54 --> 4235.70]  Thermal test platform that has I think it's like it's either six or nine
[4236.34 --> 4239.30]  sensor locations and they created a custom pcb
[4239.86 --> 4244.58]  for the uh for the monitoring piece that outputs the logs of
[4245.46 --> 4249.30]  the temperature in the case and all these different spots because we don't want to just
[4250.10 --> 4253.38]  review a gpu and show the gpu temps
[4253.38 --> 4263.06]  And the temps near your vrms and the temps on your like all over your case, right?
[4263.06 --> 4266.66]  So that we can so we can try to quantify okay this cooler design
[4267.22 --> 4270.50]  Does it assist with exhausting the hot air out of the back of the case?
[4270.50 --> 4274.66]  Does it uh does it blow all the hot air up toward your cpu area?
[4274.66 --> 4277.86]  Have you had any companies reach out and be like this is scary?
[4279.30 --> 4281.30]  Why are you guys looking so closely?
[4281.30 --> 4282.98]  Well, yeah
[4282.98 --> 4285.54]  That's our job. That's pretty funny
[4286.26 --> 4290.02]  Um, I haven't heard of that personally. That was a genuine question. I just yeah
[4290.74 --> 4293.70]  I mean, yeah, there's obviously going to be people that don't like it
[4296.10 --> 4299.62]  Most of them are smart enough to not express any trepidation
[4299.62 --> 4302.82]  Yeah, because then we're going to know to dig then you look further. Yeah, exactly
[4304.10 --> 4306.10]  Um, all right. Do you want to give me one more dan?
[4307.86 --> 4308.98]  Yep, absolutely
[4310.34 --> 4314.18]  Hi linus luke and dan well, this is weird they they're doing it normally
[4314.90 --> 4315.78]  uh
[4315.78 --> 4320.66]  Yeah, who does that what's wrong with that? How is daily driving high rr oled?
[4320.66 --> 4322.82]  Is it more efficient than ips lcd?
[4323.38 --> 4329.22]  Also ever tried tiny os 11. It's a stripped down windows 11 os. I use it and love it because there's no
[4329.46 --> 4336.66]  Useless crap we've had looking at alternative stripped down os is again on our list of things to do for a little while
[4336.66 --> 4341.30]  I think that we are we're going to get to it. It's it's a matter of time
[4341.86 --> 4343.46]  um, there can be some
[4345.30 --> 4347.78]  There's some issues. Yeah, there's some issues with these
[4348.74 --> 4354.42]  Some of them have kind of worked around the licensing issues with microsoft others. It seems like have not quite so much
[4354.98 --> 4359.54]  There's also issues around trust. You know, what is this script doing exactly?
[4359.54 --> 4362.26]  I haven't personally gone in and vetted every line of code
[4362.66 --> 4367.06]  So if I haven't, um, you know, what's my confidence level recommending it and there are some that are
[4367.54 --> 4369.06]  And then what if they update it after you do?
[4369.70 --> 4374.18]  Widely enough known that there's a level of trust there, but hey, uh, it's trust and verify, right?
[4374.18 --> 4376.50]  So if i'm just trusting then i'm not really verifying
[4376.50 --> 4379.86]  We've ran into this issue before where we'll release a video about something
[4379.86 --> 4383.78]  And then that thing will change but it's significantly harder to change the video
[4384.34 --> 4390.50]  Yep, and we've also run into um, we've also run into issues where even seemingly well-intentioned
[4390.50 --> 4393.94]  You know community efforts have evolved over time like it used to be
[4394.42 --> 4399.14]  that we would call out community like funny community uh domains
[4399.78 --> 4406.98]  um, like people would make people would make like funny websites and stuff based on jokes we'd make about domain name ideas
[4406.98 --> 4412.34]  And we'd we'd go to them and we'd laugh at the things that they've done and then we would find out that later
[4412.98 --> 4421.22]  um, they had altered it for like self-promotion or or some other kind of thing like they hadn't in good faith continued the joke
[4421.22 --> 4426.10]  There was one in particular that went like really far to the point where it it
[4426.82 --> 4428.34]  was super not okay
[4428.90 --> 4429.30]  um
[4430.02 --> 4431.62]  impersonation
[4431.62 --> 4436.26]  Trying to get money out of people tracking information all this type of stuff like it was really bad. So
[4437.06 --> 4441.70]  We try not to do that. Yeah, so we basically like it's this is why we can't have nice things right yeah
[4442.42 --> 4444.42]  As for daily driving high refresh rate oled
[4445.22 --> 4448.90]  I wouldn't say it's more efficient than ips. I mean oled has its own
[4449.70 --> 4451.14]  power draw issues
[4451.14 --> 4453.86]  um, in fact, i'm you know what i don't know
[4454.98 --> 4456.74]  I'm gonna go ahead and say i don't know
[4456.74 --> 4460.98]  I actually don't think power consumption is part of our test suite for most monitors these days
[4461.38 --> 4465.22]  Although we did check out a monitor recently that draws six watts
[4466.66 --> 4468.66]  31 and a half inches
[4468.74 --> 4474.82]  Does up to 2200 nits peak brightness what and draws six watts?
[4476.58 --> 4477.86]  See if you can figure it out
[4477.86 --> 4481.30]  I'll let him think for a second and then i'll finish talking about high refresh rate oled
[4481.30 --> 4485.30]  It's super cool. It's amazing. I don't know for sure
[4485.86 --> 4489.14]  If it will be you know if there will be zero burn in forever
[4489.86 --> 4490.26]  um
[4490.98 --> 4495.70]  It looks the the indications are that qd oled is pretty good these days
[4495.70 --> 4498.66]  But i did i did think of this before chat said it okay
[4499.22 --> 4503.94]  What is it? It's not e-ink is it? No. Yeah, okay, then i have no idea. It's lcd
[4504.66 --> 4506.02]  I have no clue
[4506.02 --> 4510.74]  It makes no sense to me at all. You heard it here first. Luke has no clue. Luke has no clue.com. Yeah. Oh
[4510.74 --> 4513.14]  I would you do this?
[4513.14 --> 4517.70]  We just talked because it's really funny, but it's gonna be a domain in like minutes. I know
[4518.82 --> 4521.30]  Don't go to it there. Oh, yeah
[4522.50 --> 4524.34]  But how else will they know that luke has no clue?
[4524.34 --> 4529.70]  What do you figure out Dan? I know what monitor is no that's cheating that video is gonna be incredible
[4530.58 --> 4535.94]  That's cheating Dan. No, I'm not i'm not saying nothing. I'm not even giving hints. You might say the video will be brilliant
[4538.42 --> 4540.42]  Dazzling
[4541.30 --> 4546.02]  I like knowing you might say that the video was a bright idea he's taunting or the monitor
[4546.02 --> 4550.18]  I want you to all understand this he's not saying things that will actually make me figure it out
[4550.18 --> 4557.30]  The video is uh, but he's just saying things to to bother me the things i'm saying right now are a reflection of how I feel about the video
[4558.50 --> 4560.10]  That's cool
[4560.10 --> 4562.10]  I've no idea
[4562.82 --> 4568.18]  We covered the full spectrum of things you might want to know about the product in our video
[4569.70 --> 4571.70]  I'm not gonna get it
[4576.34 --> 4579.22]  All right, i'll give you a better hint okay
[4579.22 --> 4581.22]  I'm probably not gonna get it so
[4581.54 --> 4582.50]  Gameboy advance
[4583.70 --> 4584.02]  What?
[4588.02 --> 4594.82]  Is it like magnifying the screen somehow? Nope. I have no idea. It has no backlight. Oh
[4596.34 --> 4596.82]  Why?
[4597.94 --> 4601.06]  How does it get to 2200 minutes peak brightness you ask?
[4602.18 --> 4604.74]  I don't know. Do you have to light it yourself?
[4604.74 --> 4609.14]  I will say that the power fits in the palm of my head
[4609.86 --> 4613.06]  Oh my god, I hate this whole conversation this whole thing just sucks
[4614.90 --> 4617.86]  You know you don't have to do and show you could end the streak and then I would win
[4619.22 --> 4621.78]  If I ended the stream now it wouldn't end the streak none of the streak
[4621.78 --> 4625.86]  Oh, oh you mean you would just quit halfway through no no no
[4627.54 --> 4628.74]  Quitters never prosper
[4628.74 --> 4630.58]  Then how would that apply to this conversation then?
[4630.58 --> 4632.58]  Look okay, this is a really good hint
[4632.90 --> 4635.70]  The power fits in the palm of my hand
[4636.66 --> 4638.50]  It's a pop culture reference good lord
[4638.50 --> 4638.90]  I don't
[4638.90 --> 4643.38]  How did you possibly think a pop culture reference was gonna help me?
[4643.94 --> 4644.50]  That's fair
[4646.02 --> 4649.06]  The power of the in the palm of my hand
[4649.06 --> 4650.26]  I have no idea
[4651.62 --> 4652.18]  Batman
[4653.70 --> 4654.90]  No, it's not Batman
[4655.54 --> 4656.50]  Nice to meet you
[4660.50 --> 4663.46]  Everyone in chat is spamming sun. Am I was I supposed to guess sun?
[4664.34 --> 4666.10]  So you put it in front of a window?
[4666.98 --> 4667.22]  Yeah
[4667.86 --> 4669.22]  That's kind of cool
[4669.78 --> 4671.22]  So and also really weird
[4671.22 --> 4672.02]  So basically
[4672.02 --> 4673.06]  It's nighttime
[4673.06 --> 4674.58]  So instead of a backlight
[4675.30 --> 4676.82]  It has a mirror like
[4677.86 --> 4680.58]  Surface behind the lcd panel
[4681.06 --> 4681.30]  Okay
[4681.94 --> 4683.06]  Is that cool or what?
[4683.06 --> 4684.26]  That's pretty neat
[4684.74 --> 4685.70]  What is it for?
[4685.70 --> 4686.98]  It's f***ing terrible
[4687.38 --> 4687.86]  Yeah
[4687.86 --> 4688.34]  Yeah
[4688.34 --> 4688.66]  Okay
[4688.66 --> 4690.58]  But it's in like the coolest way
[4690.58 --> 4692.34]  But it's interesting
[4692.34 --> 4693.78]  Oh, it's super interesting
[4693.78 --> 4695.06]  I'm excited to watch the video about it
[4695.06 --> 4696.26]  I don't think I'd want one
[4696.98 --> 4699.94]  I'm sure there's some application where it would be cool
[4699.94 --> 4700.58]  because you're like
[4701.70 --> 4704.98]  in an environment where power is like very difficult to come by
[4704.98 --> 4709.62]  I'm sure there's gotta be like somebody out there who's like oh my goodness I need this
[4710.42 --> 4711.78]  You gotta see it in person
[4711.78 --> 4712.90]  We'll grab it out for you
[4713.46 --> 4715.30]  It's something to behold I'll put it that way
[4715.30 --> 4720.02]  And we cover super cool applications of the technology in the video
[4720.02 --> 4721.94]  The muddy reptar got me
[4722.50 --> 4724.82]  He's like you can't quit while wearing a Terry Fox t-shirt
[4725.86 --> 4726.10]  Oh
[4728.98 --> 4730.98]  Now you're stuck with us forever
[4730.98 --> 4732.18]  Yeah, pretty much
[4733.86 --> 4734.66]  Oh, I love that
[4734.66 --> 4736.74]  That's a that's a deep cut for Canadians man
[4736.74 --> 4737.30]  That's true
[4737.30 --> 4739.38]  Yep, you would be letting down Terry
[4739.38 --> 4740.42]  Yeah, that's impossible
[4740.42 --> 4743.30]  Actually now is probably a good time for us to reiterate
[4743.30 --> 4750.90]  That the reason we're wearing these shirts are to support the Terry Fox run
[4751.38 --> 4754.26]  You can get your shirt at terryfox.org
[4754.26 --> 4756.58]  All proceeds support cancer research
[4756.58 --> 4761.30]  Registration for the 2024 Terry Fox run will open on April 12th
[4762.10 --> 4766.26]  And the 44th annual Terry Fox run will take place across Canada on September 15th
[4766.26 --> 4768.18]  Terry Fox is a national treasure
[4768.18 --> 4772.10]  We are extremely proud to partner with the Terry Fox Foundation
[4772.82 --> 4773.86]  When I say partner
[4773.86 --> 4776.10]  I realize that's a sponsorship
[4776.66 --> 4777.70]  Disclosure word
[4777.70 --> 4779.30]  That's not what's taking place here
[4779.30 --> 4780.02]  Obviously, we're not making money
[4780.02 --> 4781.94]  We were just thrilled to hear from them
[4781.94 --> 4785.22]  And absolutely honored to support the Terry Fox Foundation
[4785.70 --> 4788.42]  They've been doing absolutely incredible work
[4789.62 --> 4791.54]  If you don't know who Terry Fox is
[4791.54 --> 4794.50]  Then now's the time to google him learn about his life
[4794.50 --> 4795.30]  He was so young
[4795.30 --> 4798.90]  He was taken from us far too early
[4798.90 --> 4799.78]  And
[4802.82 --> 4804.26]  Yeah, absolutely incredible
[4804.26 --> 4806.02]  Diagnosed with cancer at a very young age
[4806.02 --> 4806.74]  Lost his leg
[4807.30 --> 4807.94]  Decided to
[4809.46 --> 4810.66]  Run across the country
[4811.78 --> 4812.66]  To raise awareness
[4813.22 --> 4814.82]  Raise cancer awareness and
[4815.86 --> 4817.14]  Raise money to fight cancer
[4817.14 --> 4818.34]  You're gonna break Linus up, man
[4818.34 --> 4819.22]  Damn it
[4819.22 --> 4819.94]  You're trying
[4821.54 --> 4822.34]  It's a big deal
[4822.34 --> 4822.82]  I'm done
[4822.82 --> 4824.42]  It's genuinely a very big deal
[4824.42 --> 4824.98]  Yeah
[4824.98 --> 4826.50]  And I said the obviously thing
[4826.50 --> 4828.50]  I know there's some creators that have taken money for
[4829.38 --> 4834.02]  Charity work stuff where I would like to think that it's obvious we're not doing that
[4835.94 --> 4837.54]  But yeah, just so you know
[4840.58 --> 4843.54]  Speaking of charitable sponsorships
[4845.38 --> 4847.06]  We actually are doing one
[4847.94 --> 4848.42]  Nice
[4848.42 --> 4849.22]  We are well
[4849.22 --> 4850.34]  No, it's a little complicated
[4850.34 --> 4856.66]  So we are doing a charity auction stream for bc children's hospital on april 17th
[4856.66 --> 4859.86]  This will be at around 1 p.m. Pacific on whatnot
[4860.58 --> 4862.50]  So whatnot is working with us
[4862.50 --> 4865.94]  They are an auction platform and they have kindly waived
[4865.94 --> 4866.90]  Oh, it's a little different
[4866.90 --> 4868.02]  All fees
[4868.02 --> 4871.14]  So that the proceeds will go directly to bc children's hospital
[4871.78 --> 4873.54]  We're really excited about this
[4873.54 --> 4879.22]  Our auction items include five incredibly powerful pcs that will be hand built by line of sebastian
[4879.78 --> 4883.78]  I'm just reading the talking points they put my name in there for some reason they will be built by me
[4883.78 --> 4885.70]  It's fun having you say your own last name
[4885.70 --> 4893.30]  The slowest one out of all the pcs and this is great has a 14 900k and an rtx 4080
[4894.18 --> 4897.78]  So these are going to be beast machines we're trying to raise some real money
[4897.78 --> 4901.86]  Which means huge shout out to all the companies that have donated to this cause
[4902.42 --> 4907.86]  In particular asus and corsair who have donated the majority of the components for our pc builds, but also
[4908.66 --> 4909.54]  hp
[4909.54 --> 4911.78]  Acer elgato which is also of course air
[4911.78 --> 4918.18]  uh, del intel google noctua sabrant logitech nothing
[4918.66 --> 4923.86]  The phone company not like thanks for nothing and many more wait wait wait
[4924.50 --> 4931.06]  What oh just donated to the cause okay? I get it. Yeah, I get it. I was like what computer parts are we getting from nothing and google?
[4931.06 --> 4932.18]  Yeah, don't worry about it
[4932.18 --> 4939.14]  All right, um, and we're gonna be auctioning a bunch of stuff. So not I'm gonna be building computers. Oh, but there's okay
[4939.14 --> 4943.46]  Things dude. I have wanted to do this video for like three years because it has the best title
[4944.66 --> 4946.58]  I will build you a pc right now
[4947.22 --> 4953.06]  Oh, that's gonna be the title of the video. That's pretty good right now. That's pretty so you will be able to bid
[4954.02 --> 4957.06]  On a computer while I am live. Oh
[4957.86 --> 4959.86]  It'll all be for charity
[4960.10 --> 4967.86]  And I will build it for you right in front of you. It's gonna be flipping awesome. Nice. Um, we've got a pre-built pc from main gear
[4967.86 --> 4973.86]  We've got an acer nitro 16 gaming laptop peripheral bundles phones all kinds of stuff that we're going to be auctioning for charity
[4974.26 --> 4975.14]  um
[4975.14 --> 4979.70]  Streaming bundles include custom merge from ltd store many other little bits of ltd history
[4979.94 --> 4984.26]  So if you're considering buying a computer or gaming headset or a mouse or something like that
[4984.58 --> 4988.10]  Consider doing it at our auction and having those dollars go to a good cause
[4988.10 --> 4994.66]  I doubt that the price is going to be the best price because people tend to go kind of wild when it comes to charity auctions, but
[4994.66 --> 4996.66]  But it's cool. That's a feature
[4997.14 --> 4999.14]  Not a bug quite literally um
[4999.62 --> 5005.54]  And as I already said all of the proceeds are going to go to bc children's hospital, which is one of our favorite
[5006.10 --> 5008.10]  causes to donate to
[5008.42 --> 5008.98]  I
[5008.98 --> 5013.78]  Think oh the last little update thing for those of you who sat through this
[5014.58 --> 5017.62]  This is kind of a big deal. It's funny. I um
[5017.62 --> 5024.34]  I came across a post and i'm not going to name any names, but it was basically like
[5025.54 --> 5027.86]  comparing sort of our
[5028.26 --> 5028.58]  um
[5029.54 --> 5033.54]  Our quality of our guests to another content creator
[5034.34 --> 5036.34]  and I was like
[5036.42 --> 5041.62]  I mean, we don't really like do guests last time we even had one and the and the issue for us is that we are
[5042.18 --> 5048.42]  Chronically not on schedule and the thing about having important guests is that if you are late for them. That's pretty fucked up
[5048.82 --> 5049.14]  um
[5049.14 --> 5052.02]  It's bad enough that we're late for the show in general and
[5052.74 --> 5054.26]  We are sincerely sorry
[5054.26 --> 5058.10]  It is all in the pursuit of building you guys the best float plane and the best content that we possibly can
[5058.10 --> 5060.10]  He's saying you're not important guests
[5060.10 --> 5063.54]  Not saying that they're not they're not guests. They're homies. That's different
[5064.82 --> 5065.94]  the point is that
[5066.66 --> 5068.66]  it's funny timing because
[5068.98 --> 5076.26]  Only a couple weeks after I came across that I had possibly the biggest guest this is fall into my lap
[5076.26 --> 5077.78]  This is actually crazy. Um
[5078.82 --> 5081.62]  And it was just it was serendipitous, but next week
[5082.42 --> 5083.86]  We will be having the one
[5083.86 --> 5089.14]  The only mr. Jim keller joining us for a call in
[5089.70 --> 5092.58]  uh, for those of you who do not know who this is
[5093.46 --> 5097.46]  Same thing with as with terry fox. Okay, totally different fields, right?
[5098.58 --> 5102.90]  But google him right now. Yeah, um, he is the ceo of tens torrent
[5103.54 --> 5107.54]  He was the lead architect of amd's k8 micro architecture
[5107.54 --> 5111.14]  He co-designed the x86 64 instruction set
[5111.62 --> 5114.90]  He was later the lead designer on the zen architecture
[5115.22 --> 5120.74]  He also had a big role in designing the apple a4 and a5 the company's first in-house socs
[5121.30 --> 5124.74]  And he worked at tesla during the development of their autopilot technology
[5125.54 --> 5127.38]  anyone asking who jim keller is
[5128.58 --> 5129.70]  please
[5129.70 --> 5130.42]  um
[5130.42 --> 5131.86]  So we're gonna have him on the show
[5131.86 --> 5135.38]  He's going to be talking about what he's doing at tens torrent guys an absolute
[5135.38 --> 5141.14]  Legend in the computing world. I'm just dropping links in the chat
[5141.78 --> 5143.46]  You guys are not going to want to miss this
[5144.02 --> 5148.98]  These links are to where you guys can suggest some topics of conversation
[5149.46 --> 5152.50]  Obviously i'm going to be asking him about his new gig right now
[5152.98 --> 5156.26]  But if you guys have any kind of questions that are not going to get him in
[5156.98 --> 5160.98]  You know non-disclosure agreement trouble or anything like that like don't ask him to like
[5161.62 --> 5163.94]  You know talk smack about previous companies
[5163.94 --> 5166.74]  We're for like it's not going to be that's not the kind of thing we're doing here
[5167.30 --> 5171.38]  But if you have anything that you want to kind of hear us discuss with mr. Jim keller
[5171.38 --> 5174.50]  We are getting an opportunity to talk to him. We're really excited about it
[5175.38 --> 5181.14]  We uh, it's funny because the topic came up in a conversation with tens torn about like hey, how do we
[5181.62 --> 5184.26]  How do we work together what you guys are doing looks really cool?
[5184.26 --> 5186.90]  And we saw you guys have this dev kit and
[5187.70 --> 5188.58]  um, you know
[5188.58 --> 5192.82]  Is is that our opportunity to cover it and talk about it or do you have something coming down the pipe?
[5192.82 --> 5196.34]  Basically, it was an exploratory call. I jumped on with them and they were like, oh, yeah
[5196.34 --> 5199.14]  You know, it'd be really cool as if we like had jim on and I was like
[5199.94 --> 5204.42]  Uh, they're like, yeah, we don't really know if you guys like do guests or anything. I'm like, well, here's the thing we don't
[5205.46 --> 5207.46]  But when is jim going to be able to join us?
[5207.46 --> 5209.46]  Yeah
[5210.34 --> 5216.10]  Um, it's one of those things where I this is funny. So I I assign someone to go through the
[5216.90 --> 5219.54]  um, to go through oh the formed the form doesn't work
[5220.18 --> 5224.90]  I will uh, I'll reach out to the guy who made it. Okay, dan will dan will get it fixed the point is
[5226.58 --> 5229.54]  I asked a couple people on the team to create the form and
[5230.34 --> 5236.10]  Go through the responses to the form to kind of see what's what are the biggest things the most common things people want to see
[5236.10 --> 5239.30]  Us talk about and I was like, okay, and can you also kind of put together?
[5239.86 --> 5242.98]  Um, you know some stuff to help guide the conversation because
[5243.70 --> 5246.34]  As much as I can talk fairly intelligently about
[5247.22 --> 5250.26]  Most areas of technology. I know just enough to be dangerous
[5250.90 --> 5257.14]  And I do not want to look like any more of an idiot by comparison than I already will
[5257.14 --> 5264.34]  With him on the show. It's yeah, it's gonna be bad. It's like most most people are pretty dumb dumb
[5264.58 --> 5266.10]  He's he's gotta be in my like
[5267.30 --> 5269.94]  I don't know exactly where but I was I was trying to think of like
[5270.58 --> 5276.26]  Of individuals exact names that i've like googled in my lifespan. He's got to be up there
[5277.22 --> 5279.78]  Yeah, every once in a blue moon. I'm just like what is he up to?
[5280.34 --> 5283.94]  I'll make him products with sick names. Have you seen their their product names?
[5283.94 --> 5285.46]  10s torrent? Yeah
[5285.46 --> 5286.90]  Yeah, gray skull
[5287.70 --> 5288.42]  So sick
[5289.06 --> 5291.06]  Everything's so boring these days
[5291.06 --> 5294.10]  Here, but the the gray skull e 75
[5294.10 --> 5298.18]  Yeah, this is the dev kit one, right? Yeah, this is this is the dev card
[5299.30 --> 5301.78]  This is already from chatting with them
[5302.74 --> 5304.74]  Kinda old news
[5305.54 --> 5311.94]  But this is all about so they he probably will talk about this and this is something that they are promoting right now
[5311.94 --> 5313.94]  Because they do want to get these in people's hands
[5315.62 --> 5316.42]  So that they can
[5317.38 --> 5321.30]  Interact with the hardware so that when the time comes
[5322.90 --> 5325.06]  Things are gonna work yeah, and they're
[5326.18 --> 5331.06]  Well, i'm gonna let him talk about how excited they are about what they're working on i'm so stoked
[5331.06 --> 5332.74]  Yeah, it's gonna be excited for this
[5336.58 --> 5337.86]  Oh, it's just a cool
[5337.86 --> 5338.42]  Coolio
[5338.42 --> 5340.66]  Hold on a second coolio ash says i'm gonna be honest
[5340.66 --> 5343.78]  I have no idea what the products he's made are used for but it's obvious. He's done some big things
[5343.78 --> 5344.82]  Okay, so let's go through it
[5345.70 --> 5346.50]  K8
[5346.58 --> 5347.70]  That was
[5347.70 --> 5348.82]  Before zen
[5348.82 --> 5350.66]  Okay, so before ryzen
[5350.66 --> 5355.94]  That was the last time that amd stole the performance crown from intel they stole it hard they came out of absolutely
[5356.66 --> 5357.62]  nowhere
[5357.62 --> 5362.58]  having been kind of languishing for a fairly extended period of time and
[5362.58 --> 5371.30]  crushed it not only did they come take the single core performance crown they beat intel to 64 bit they beat intel to
[5371.86 --> 5373.94]  multi-core computing and just
[5374.58 --> 5376.42]  slayed it
[5376.42 --> 5378.42]  Mr. Keller moved on
[5378.42 --> 5382.82]  I believe his next port of call was apple don't don't quote me on that
[5382.82 --> 5385.14]  I forget the exact order of operations here because
[5385.14 --> 5389.22]  I think he's done some shorter stints and gone back and stuff don't yeah, don't worry about it
[5389.46 --> 5395.54]  But the point is the a4 the a4 was when the iphone stopped using commodity chips guys
[5396.10 --> 5397.70]  Stopped using commodity chipsets
[5398.18 --> 5399.78]  That was when apple silicon
[5399.78 --> 5403.46]  I mean apple brands their computing their computer products apple silicon
[5403.46 --> 5408.98]  But that was where apple silicon was born when apple started designing processors
[5408.98 --> 5415.46]  That outperformed anything else that was on the market from companies that had been doing it forever and
[5416.34 --> 5420.10]  Obviously none of these things happen from just one person, but
[5421.86 --> 5426.82]  There's a bit of a pattern just look up look up his wikipedia page and look at his known for
[5427.14 --> 5432.26]  Athlon k7 amd k8 lead architect amd k12 amd zen
[5432.26 --> 5441.30]  Apple a4 apple a5 a co-author of x86 64 tesla hardware 3.0 and a co-author of hyper transport. It's like oh
[5444.02 --> 5445.86]  Whoa done some things yeah
[5446.66 --> 5451.54]  Um, so then anyway the what I was getting to was when amd finally came back
[5452.58 --> 5454.58]  ryzen
[5455.62 --> 5457.62]  What was the common thread
[5458.02 --> 5459.46]  Jim came back to amd
[5459.46 --> 5462.82]  Uh, he's not there now though. He's doing tens torrent
[5462.82 --> 5468.26]  So he's been he's been working on some ai stuff, which is definitely in his wheelhouse from that time spent on
[5468.50 --> 5471.06]  um, yeah, it was hardware 3.0 at tesla. I think
[5472.02 --> 5473.46]  Yeah, the um
[5474.50 --> 5480.74]  Uh, the autopilot hardware. Yeah, so yeah excited excited. It's gonna be awesome. Uh, dan, what are we supposed to be doing right now?
[5483.54 --> 5484.74]  Oh sponsors. Yes
[5485.62 --> 5487.62]  Let us indeed do that
[5488.10 --> 5489.54]  The form is fixed by the way
[5489.54 --> 5490.98]  Uh, the show is
[5490.98 --> 5492.26]  The show is brought to you by
[5493.78 --> 5494.50]  8g1
[5494.50 --> 5500.18]  Instead of swallowing hundreds of supplements like a carp eats pellets try ag1
[5500.50 --> 5503.22]  Which is a much easier spoonful to swallow?
[5503.62 --> 5507.94]  It's an all-in-one supplement that has 75 different vitamins minerals and antioxidants
[5508.34 --> 5514.02]  And their team is always trying to find better ways to source test and find the best quality ingredients available
[5514.02 --> 5517.38]  Ag1 tests for hundreds of contaminants and banned substances
[5517.38 --> 5520.74]  Which is much better than the supplement industry's average of 10?
[5521.78 --> 5523.62]  I mean that shouldn't surprise me, but
[5524.42 --> 5529.54]  Anyway, it really is as easy as one scoop a day instead of purchasing all your different vitamins separately
[5529.54 --> 5535.38]  Uh, luke dennis maria and actually a few other members here at lmg have tried or even use ag1 daily
[5535.38 --> 5540.58]  Whether it's because they wanted to stop cutting corners after a diet change or just because they like the way it tasted in a breakfast
[5540.58 --> 5544.90]  Smoothie ag1 just made sense and you can try ag1 and get a free

[5646.18 --> 5646.74]  We did
[5646.74 --> 5649.06]  But we didn't miss the rain
[5649.62 --> 5653.70]  Got him. It rains pretty often here in vancouver, but thankfully we have vessi
[5653.94 --> 5658.02]  Vessi makes comfortable and breathable shoes that most importantly are
[5658.66 --> 5662.02]  Highly water resistant they even say waterproof
[5662.58 --> 5666.26]  The best thing is they're not made with rubber like those generic rain boots
[5666.74 --> 5671.22]  Gross put those away. They're light and breathable and super easy to put on
[5671.22 --> 5678.82]  Also, all their products are vegan and cruelty free. That's right. They don't put any vegans into their products. Oh, that would have been cruel

[5699.30 --> 5700.50]  All right
[5700.50 --> 5703.86]  I I might have to report you to your boss. Why what did I do?
[5703.86 --> 5708.02]  Because when one of my employees was trying to work on something
[5708.42 --> 5712.26]  You put him on camera in order to shame his uh lack of performance
[5712.74 --> 5719.22]  Which seems unfair it wasn't the lack of performance. What was it? It was the um funniness of it
[5722.58 --> 5725.38]  I'm only trying to fix a form while doing sponsor reads
[5726.42 --> 5727.06]  It's fine
[5727.06 --> 5729.06]  It's fine
[5729.06 --> 5730.42]  Exactly exactly
[5730.42 --> 5734.74]  Here's what I want to know my bandwidth is unacceptable. Why doesn't luke think that you can handle this?
[5735.46 --> 5741.22]  Because luke does not trust me at all. He's a terrible manager and person exactly
[5741.22 --> 5742.74]  I guess I lose this game
[5742.74 --> 5745.86]  All I'm trying to demonstrate is that even with the spotlight on him
[5746.58 --> 5748.74]  Dan never crumbles
[5748.74 --> 5749.30]  He'll get my name one day
[5749.30 --> 5750.02]  Yeah
[5753.14 --> 5754.58]  Dane I was gonna say dane
[5754.58 --> 5755.54]  Why
[5755.54 --> 5756.18]  Dave
[5756.18 --> 5760.26]  Get out of here
[5760.26 --> 5761.14]  I like working here
[5761.14 --> 5761.54]  It's fine
[5761.54 --> 5764.66]  I gotta talk to my therapist about this
[5764.66 --> 5768.02]  But hey
[5768.02 --> 5768.66]  But hey
[5768.66 --> 5770.10]  It'll be partially covered
[5770.10 --> 5770.82]  That's right
[5770.82 --> 5771.22]  Yeah
[5771.22 --> 5774.26]  You pay for it so that I can deal with you day in and day out
[5774.26 --> 5776.10]  It's a perfect system
[5776.10 --> 5777.62]  I didn't think it was partial covering
[5777.62 --> 5778.66]  Well it depends
[5778.66 --> 5779.62]  Up to a certain amount
[5779.62 --> 5780.02]  Yeah
[5780.02 --> 5780.26]  I mean
[5780.26 --> 5780.82]  Yeah
[5780.82 --> 5782.50]  With the amount of therapy Dan needs
[5782.50 --> 5783.46]  So not covered at all
[5786.98 --> 5790.42]  I'm the reason why the uh the amount is lower for everybody else at the company
[5790.42 --> 5794.74]  Oh boy
[5794.74 --> 5795.30]  Where are we?
[5795.30 --> 5796.26]  Are we doing merch messages?
[5796.26 --> 5797.46]  Let's less cancel ourselves
[5797.46 --> 5797.70]  Yeah
[5797.70 --> 5798.82]  No it's just me
[5798.82 --> 5799.38]  Should be good
[5800.82 --> 5801.62]  Merch messages?
[5801.62 --> 5801.86]  Yeah
[5801.86 --> 5804.90]  How about Apple is setting its users free and freedom is scary?
[5805.46 --> 5805.78]  Oh
[5806.02 --> 5806.66]  Kind of funny
[5807.06 --> 5810.34]  Apple has further loosened some restrictions on iOS
[5810.34 --> 5811.86]  It's actually been really interesting
[5812.42 --> 5815.14]  Ever since the EU crackdown and now the US antitrust
[5815.14 --> 5817.70]  How quickly Apple is running around trying to be like
[5817.70 --> 5819.38]  Ah ah ah um
[5819.38 --> 5821.70]  Well no no like we're not a
[5823.14 --> 5825.54]  Apple has further loosened some restrictions on iOS
[5825.54 --> 5829.70]  Including now allowing retro game emulators on the iOS app store
[5830.66 --> 5833.70]  And reforming its pairs pairing
[5833.70 --> 5834.98]  It's pairs pairing system
[5834.98 --> 5839.30]  Its pairing system to allow more devices to be salvaged for parts
[5840.02 --> 5842.42]  This is pretty cool news
[5842.66 --> 5844.82]  Remember we talked recently about how we you know
[5845.54 --> 5847.46]  You never report on the good stuff right?
[5847.46 --> 5847.78]  Yeah
[5847.78 --> 5848.42]  Yeah
[5848.42 --> 5849.70]  This is good
[5849.70 --> 5850.18]  Yeah
[5850.18 --> 5853.06]  Apple never had a formal rule against emulators
[5853.06 --> 5856.26]  But it barred apps that ran external code
[5856.26 --> 5858.34]  Which included emulators
[5858.34 --> 5861.62]  Apple is now explicitly allowing emulators
[5861.62 --> 5866.82]  Though they will need to be age rated in accordance with the most explicit content available for them
[5866.82 --> 5870.10]  And they must comply with all relevant laws regarding emulation
[5870.74 --> 5872.10]  What was that old game?
[5874.42 --> 5875.30]  Leisure Suit Larry
[5875.30 --> 5875.54]  Yeah
[5875.54 --> 5878.74]  I knew where he's calling this
[5878.74 --> 5880.26]  That's gonna screw up all the emulators
[5880.82 --> 5881.06]  Yeah
[5881.06 --> 5887.14]  Anywho the change is primarily due to recent regulatory changes in Europe
[5887.78 --> 5891.30]  So yeah I said that Apple was changing things
[5891.30 --> 5895.70]  But realistically what's happening is Apple is finally being forced to play nice
[5896.42 --> 5902.18]  Apple has also announced that it will be working on a new framework to allow customers and independent repair shops
[5902.74 --> 5906.18]  To use more existing parts from used devices
[5906.18 --> 5911.22]  Rather than blocking their use with software locks under the assumption that the salvaged device has been stolen
[5911.70 --> 5914.90]  Apple says this new system will still protect users privacy
[5915.30 --> 5919.14]  This will also include calibration for used parts after they are installed
[5919.14 --> 5925.78]  So basically they are finally walking back some of the pairing that they've been requiring
[5925.78 --> 5931.86]  So there was this whole thing with batteries and with screens where you could take two perfectly working iphones
[5932.26 --> 5936.74]  Take them apart switch their screens boot them back up and you'd get like it
[5937.06 --> 5941.54]  Depending on the part you'd get an error message or you would get hindered functionality
[5942.18 --> 5946.34]  It's almost like it was never about privacy at all isn't it?
[5947.62 --> 5947.94]  Yeah
[5947.94 --> 5954.74]  Because now now that it's allowed they're like we can do it without compromising privacy almost never is
[5954.98 --> 5957.62]  It's almost like that was the point the whole time
[5958.50 --> 5960.90]  Was that they could or that was what they could have done the whole time?
[5960.90 --> 5965.86]  It's almost like this whole thing was just made up. Yeah. Wow really?
[5966.50 --> 5969.46]  Yeah, you don't say with that said this is really funny
[5970.98 --> 5977.38]  Some Apple fans don't seem to appreciate some of their new freedoms. This is great
[5977.94 --> 5984.18]  Thanks to the EU we have one more screen during the iPhone onboarding clown. Oh, no
[5984.18 --> 5988.18]  Not everyone knows what one more browser is far from it
[5988.18 --> 5993.62]  Why not ask for a default music player default mail app default camera app while we're at it?
[5995.06 --> 5997.86]  Unironically, that's a really good idea
[5997.86 --> 6002.42]  Is it I don't know I don't know if I care about that personally, I?
[6002.42 --> 6004.42]  I
[6004.90 --> 6011.22]  Think for music player, I don't I don't know if I care about camera app like that like this as far as I can tell this is them effectively
[6012.10 --> 6016.82]  Exposing like the app store as part of the opening your phone like no
[6016.82 --> 6022.10]  This is this is part of the the you can't have safari just be the only thing on Ios
[6022.10 --> 6023.54]  Yeah, but they're saying it's uh
[6023.54 --> 6029.46]  The onboarding personally, I don't necessarily think that this needs to be a part of the onboarding. It just needs to be something that you can do
[6029.46 --> 6030.66]  Oh, sure
[6030.66 --> 6031.38]  Um
[6031.38 --> 6032.90]  Sure, that's fair enough. I mean
[6033.46 --> 6035.46]  Honestly, I don't mind it at onboarding
[6035.70 --> 6039.30]  Um, I I don't know if I want every single thing that my phone can do
[6040.42 --> 6046.98]  I I don't necessarily want to make a choice where it now downloads that app or whatever instantly when I'm trying to set up a new device
[6046.98 --> 6049.14]  That's compromise kind of annoying one screen
[6049.14 --> 6055.54]  Where it has all the default apps you can click into them and change them or you can go all the way down and go continue
[6055.54 --> 6058.90]  I'm on board compromise. Give me that skip button. All right, let's go and then I don't care
[6058.90 --> 6062.82]  Yeah, because like what if I am an apple user that's just like yeah, I just want all the apple stuff
[6062.82 --> 6069.94]  Which there's gonna be tons of them and that's the whole thing that a lot of the people who argue for apple's walled garden and apple's
[6070.50 --> 6075.38]  Anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices will say they'll say well, I just want I don't want to pick
[6075.38 --> 6077.38]  I just want them to tell me what's good
[6077.38 --> 6082.10]  They still can and you can still just use whatever apple tells you to use
[6083.14 --> 6085.14]  It's okay
[6085.62 --> 6092.02]  It's fine. I find it interesting that chrome is at like the bottom of the list. Well, I mean no one said apple
[6092.82 --> 6096.18]  Couldn't maliciously comply. I will say uh
[6097.06 --> 6101.78]  I've been using I don't know if i've talked about this on the show ever. I've been using the firefox mobile browser
[6102.50 --> 6104.66]  for like a decade
[6104.66 --> 6108.74]  Never had a single problem. It's fantastic
[6109.30 --> 6115.30]  I have my my uh, like url bar search bar stuff is at the bottom. I prefer that a ton
[6115.30 --> 6119.54]  It's a user setting. It's stuck for like years. It's great. I love firefox mobile
[6120.66 --> 6122.66]  That's all I have to say. That's it
[6122.82 --> 6126.66]  Someone was surprised. They're like, wait, what is that? They saw my phone and they're like, what is that? I was like, it's
[6127.30 --> 6129.86]  My browser like what do you mean? It doesn't look like chrome. I was like
[6132.10 --> 6137.54]  It's not chrome it's firefox and they're like use firefox remote. Yeah, it's great. I don't know
[6138.82 --> 6142.50]  You're a liar. No, I'm not everyone who uses firefox lies. You told me that
[6142.50 --> 6146.18]  No, no, no, no
[6146.82 --> 6152.90]  All the people not all the people the contact the context for that was we did a poll on float plane during the wandshow
[6152.90 --> 6158.18]  Asking what percentage of people use firefox and I just and then luke not right went into
[6158.82 --> 6162.58]  Our logs for the actual access not me aj did sorry aj
[6163.06 --> 6169.46]  Uh went into our logs for the percentage of float plane users that use firefox and those numbers were not similar
[6169.46 --> 6172.34]  Not even sort of close and like some people are like, oh, yeah
[6172.34 --> 6177.78]  You can spoof what browser it is and some people do this for compatibility because a site will say that it doesn't work with firefox
[6177.78 --> 6181.38]  But if you just tell it that you're actually using chrome instead, it will actually work just fine
[6183.78 --> 6187.78]  There's pretty much no way the amount of people that do that make up the gap
[6188.50 --> 6194.26]  Um, I can't say for sure but pretty much no way. This is totally off topic, but do you make that poll dad?
[6195.78 --> 6197.78]  Is luke a liar?
[6197.78 --> 6201.14]  The options are yes and yes, but I use firefox
[6204.90 --> 6206.90]  They like their polls
[6206.90 --> 6212.58]  This is amazing. I get weird with them when we do the super checks after party the float plane exclusive stream. Oh, really?
[6212.66 --> 6213.94]  Yeah, uh, we
[6214.90 --> 6219.86]  Every single time you well like who's gonna win the round and they just get strange
[6219.86 --> 6221.86]  I
[6222.10 --> 6227.46]  I should look into that we have a we have a viewer. We can see every poll ever made and who made it. Oh, really?
[6227.46 --> 6230.34]  I didn't know that. Yeah, I should be more careful. Yeah
[6231.30 --> 6233.86]  um, this is just totally off topic, but
[6234.50 --> 6240.74]  I was I was looking at the chats and i'm obviously mostly looking at float plane chat, but twitch chat is upset because there's another ad break
[6240.74 --> 6243.22]  This is really weird. So
[6244.42 --> 6248.66]  Someone here turned on ads on twitch and like really intrusively
[6248.98 --> 6256.26]  Um, and I turned them off and then someone here. I think colton. I know yes colton colton turn them back on and said don't touch that setting anymore
[6256.26 --> 6259.30]  We're having ads on on twitch and I think they run every 20 minutes
[6259.30 --> 6261.86]  For some reason
[6262.50 --> 6264.98]  Even though the wan show gets interrupted
[6265.86 --> 6274.26]  Every 20 minutes on twitch for an ad break and there are no ad breaks on any other platform where it broadcasts
[6274.34 --> 6277.78]  Obviously, i'm not going to expect everyone to move over to float plane where there's a monthly subscription
[6277.78 --> 6285.22]  Does youtube not ad break during live streams there are we do not have them enabled on youtube. Oh, they're not enabled. I and they're not on facebook for sure
[6285.22 --> 6286.50]  We also stream on facebook
[6286.50 --> 6288.50]  What is it about?
[6289.46 --> 6291.54]  The experience of watching on twitch
[6292.26 --> 6294.18]  That makes it so that no no hold on hold on
[6294.58 --> 6301.70]  Nobody has abandoned it in spite of the ad breaks that are not on other platforms like our viewership is basically the same as it always is
[6301.70 --> 6303.70]  I have a theory
[6303.70 --> 6305.70]  as much as I hate it
[6305.70 --> 6307.70]  despise it even
[6308.10 --> 6310.10]  the people want
[6310.74 --> 6316.42]  A smaller internet they want to just stay on the sites that they use and if there's twitch frogs instead
[6316.42 --> 6318.98]  Of youtube users, they're just going to stay there
[6320.10 --> 6322.34]  They will not have alternatives
[6324.50 --> 6330.50]  It sucks we had this really cool internet where there was all these unique cool websites where people would do neat things and others like
[6330.74 --> 6333.46]  like justin.tv people use like five websites
[6334.42 --> 6337.94]  And yeah, oh, there's more than five websites that are possible. I mean individuals like
[6337.94 --> 6344.50]  There's it's very common that individual people will not navigate to more than a very very small handful of websites
[6344.66 --> 6346.66]  They'll be like yeah, i'm a
[6346.66 --> 6349.30]  reddit and facebook and twitter user
[6350.34 --> 6352.98]  And I google things sometimes and that's it
[6352.98 --> 6354.58]  Yeah, I can see that
[6354.58 --> 6355.30]  Oh
[6355.30 --> 6359.06]  Well, want to do a merch message? I need to run to the washroom. I drink this whole thing sure
[6359.06 --> 6359.70]  Sure
[6359.70 --> 6360.50]  Sure
[6360.50 --> 6362.74]  Let's see if I have any for luke
[6362.74 --> 6367.54]  By the way, the results of the poll are 71% is luke a liar? Yes, but I use firefox, which is
[6368.90 --> 6370.90]  I think I actually enjoy that good job
[6371.70 --> 6372.34]  Nice
[6372.34 --> 6378.42]  Yeah, I mean they're fun. They're like that. Yeah, um, I think I had one in here for you luke. Let me see if I can find it none
[6379.94 --> 6382.74]  Is this the secret part of the show where I get to talk about slay the spire 2?
[6382.74 --> 6388.90]  Oh, did they well there was actually one in here about kind of godot and stuff like that. Did they pivot?
[6388.90 --> 6389.70]  Yeah
[6389.70 --> 6390.98]  Yeah, it's in godot
[6390.98 --> 6391.54]  Hell, yeah
[6391.54 --> 6396.02]  So those part two's in godot. So they did dancing whatever I always forgot that already forgot the name of it
[6396.02 --> 6400.42]  Here I go. Oh, yeah, we talked about that last week dancing dancing duelists. Yeah
[6400.74 --> 6405.86]  So they did dancing duelists in godot and then they followed through with what they were talking about by the way dancing duelists is free
[6405.86 --> 6408.90]  You can just go get it. It's great. Um
[6409.70 --> 6412.66]  But yeah, they followed through with it. So this part two's coming in godot
[6412.90 --> 6414.90]  I looked at some of the screenshots
[6414.90 --> 6415.22]  That makes me so happy
[6415.22 --> 6419.14]  for slay the spire 2 and it like looks very similar and uh, yeah, sounds good
[6419.14 --> 6422.82]  I'm probably gonna spend uh, my whole rest of my life playing that game. So that's cool
[6423.70 --> 6430.98]  Um, I picked up one a while ago called core keeper, which was also done in in godot. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Well engine
[6431.30 --> 6432.58]  I found I'm gonna as well
[6432.58 --> 6438.50]  I'm gonna give same shameless promotion to someone else. Um, if you youtube godot
[6439.22 --> 6440.42]  for
[6440.42 --> 6444.02]  Tutorial 11 hours, it's probably gonna work. I bet you it works
[6444.58 --> 6448.50]  Yeah, there's a video from clear code the channels named clear code
[6448.50 --> 6451.06]  It has 1.1 million views right now as uploaded nine months ago
[6451.06 --> 6453.14]  Just you can make sure you're finding the right one
[6453.14 --> 6458.50]  It's a 11 and a half hour long tutorial that is called the ultimate introduction to godot 4
[6459.22 --> 6461.54]  And if you look into the description
[6463.46 --> 6465.46]  There's a part two
[6466.26 --> 6472.98]  Oh, I think I think i've been into this video and there's a part two for it and this tutorial is
[6473.78 --> 6475.78]  amazing
[6475.78 --> 6481.06]  I was like having a really hard time trying to decide between game maker and godot because I wanted to do a
[6482.02 --> 6484.90]  I wanted to do 2d game development and this tutorial
[6486.02 --> 6493.38]  Being as amazing as it is is what convinced me to work in godot because I actually think right now that I like the tutorial more than I like the engine
[6493.38 --> 6500.82]  Which I don't dislike the engine at all to be very clear, but the tutorial is just fantastic the person whoever does clear code
[6500.82 --> 6501.46]  um
[6501.46 --> 6507.22]  very very very good explanations really really interesting order of how they do everything
[6508.10 --> 6514.34]  And then they do a very good job of explaining concepts at a relatively base level and then
[6515.22 --> 6517.86]  Setting you up for like okay now here's your challenge
[6517.86 --> 6522.58]  These are the three things that I want you to do and those things are slightly more advanced than what they taught you
[6522.82 --> 6526.50]  But you know enough to figure it out yourself. So you have to work through the engine
[6527.14 --> 6530.02]  And see how it works and kind of navigate things and do it on your own
[6530.26 --> 6533.94]  And then you continue the video and he teaches you more things and then you keep going it's
[6533.94 --> 6540.34]  Very very well done and it doesn't start losing quality. I'm like four hours in or something and it's still amazing
[6540.74 --> 6548.50]  um, so if you're if you're interested in game development or godot, um, I would highly recommend checking out clear code and especially this
[6549.06 --> 6556.66]  The ultimate introduction to clear code video because it's our ultimate introduction to godot 4 video because it's it's fantastic. It is super long, but like
[6558.18 --> 6563.06]  I was trying to look at some of the like the shorter more digestible ones and i'm like yeah, this isn't enough of an introduction
[6563.94 --> 6570.26]  I haven't touched game engine seriously in a super long time. I really need a deep dive right and this thing was has been
[6571.06 --> 6574.18]  amazing so far. Um, so yeah, check it out
[6577.38 --> 6579.38]  Love it next
[6579.38 --> 6586.02]  Hey, DLL i'm curious on your opinions if any on mega crit switching from unity to cadeau
[6586.50 --> 6589.62]  Do you think more game companies should switch to open source engines?
[6589.62 --> 6592.82]  Uh, also any updates on ltd socks?
[6595.86 --> 6596.74]  Still working at it
[6596.74 --> 6600.90]  Open source engines are cool. Um open source is not
[6601.46 --> 6604.18]  Like it's not in my this i'm gonna piss some people off
[6604.82 --> 6611.46]  It it doesn't automatically become the best thing because it is open source. Um, I really like godot. It seems great so far
[6611.78 --> 6612.74]  um, I
[6613.62 --> 6618.66]  Do not believe that everyone making a 3d game in unreal should switch to godot
[6619.30 --> 6619.86]  um
[6620.18 --> 6624.42]  I I don't think everyone making a 2d game in game makers should switch to godot
[6624.74 --> 6629.94]  There might be some decent arguments for people making anything in unity switching to anything else
[6630.18 --> 6630.50]  um
[6631.14 --> 6634.18]  But those are those are based on like business practices stuff like that
[6634.66 --> 6634.98]  um
[6635.86 --> 6642.82]  But there there are really good things about open source and one of the things that can be scary about open source is the
[6643.38 --> 6645.30]  Abandonment of projects and things like that
[6646.02 --> 6651.70]  Um, something that can maybe increase confidence is when you start seeing bigger companies bigger groups
[6652.42 --> 6656.66]  um getting behind and using different open source projects mega crit
[6657.22 --> 6663.22]  um moving to godot and releasing eventually in 2025 slay the aspire 2 in godot
[6663.22 --> 6668.82]  Could be very big for godot adoption and be very important. Um
[6670.18 --> 6674.18]  But I don't know enough. I'm not here to recommend anything in that realm. I am a novice
[6674.18 --> 6677.22]  I'm just having fun going through that tutorial. So I don't know whatever
[6679.54 --> 6681.54]  Alexander asks
[6681.70 --> 6684.26]  Linus will you be going on to the yard at the end of this month?
[6685.22 --> 6687.22]  Ludwig said you'll be coming on
[6687.70 --> 6689.06]  Yes
[6689.06 --> 6691.78]  Nice. I'm gonna be on the yard. It's gonna be awesome
[6692.42 --> 6696.42]  I'm going down there for our collab. Uh, we're gonna do the bro versus bro
[6697.30 --> 6702.90]  Thing I'm probably gonna lose so that's cool. I suspect you might get more cancelled
[6704.02 --> 6709.94]  From being on there than being on here. Really? Well, I'm just hearing this now, so I'm assuming I won't be there
[6710.42 --> 6715.70]  And those guys are gonna have a very fun time seeing how far you'll go on things. I'm sure. Oh
[6715.70 --> 6718.90]  You've never heard the podcast have you?
[6720.10 --> 6720.82]  No, no
[6721.46 --> 6723.22]  It's gonna be sick. I mean
[6724.26 --> 6727.06]  I went on uh, KB mod. It's great back in the day
[6728.74 --> 6731.30]  I didn't get any trouble for that. Don't know if you should have brought that up or not
[6736.74 --> 6738.82]  Fair enough. I'm sure it'll be great
[6738.82 --> 6745.14]  I am mildly concerned. That's all I'll say. Oh wait, KB mod no pka. That's the one. Oh
[6746.18 --> 6747.54]  Painkiller already. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[6747.54 --> 6752.58]  I thought that was what wait hold on what was uh, I thought KB mod and pka had something to do with each other
[6753.22 --> 6755.22]  Hold on
[6756.90 --> 6758.34]  Hold on
[6758.34 --> 6761.94]  Uh, no, maybe they have nothing to do with each other. Okay. No, I completely forgot
[6762.82 --> 6764.66]  Well, cool
[6764.66 --> 6769.38]  Apparently, I don't even know what podcast i've been on so this is good. We're off to a really good start here
[6771.38 --> 6779.14]  Very commonly does podcast appearances. No, I don't even though. This is my that was the whole point. It does on every friday. What's wrong with you? Oh my goodness
[6785.30 --> 6786.66]  Wait, I did do KB mod
[6786.66 --> 6797.46]  I'm pretty sure that's me. I don't know look at sad linus. Oh boy
[6801.46 --> 6802.90]  Um, hold on
[6806.98 --> 6808.98]  Okay
[6808.98 --> 6811.06]  Yes, I I did both
[6811.06 --> 6817.06]  So yeah, nice, that's good sure
[6820.50 --> 6824.90]  Yep, sponsored by squarespace nice good stuff. I mean if squarespace sponsors it can't be that bad
[6826.02 --> 6831.14]  What do you mean memory of a goldfish? It was nine years ago. I don't remember almost anything from back then
[6831.14 --> 6837.30]  I'm supposed to remember every and I kind of remembered every podcast. I was on nine years ago
[6837.30 --> 6842.50]  You technically remembered both of them. KB mod was ten years ago. You just thought it might have been one or the other
[6843.62 --> 6845.62]  I don't even remember
[6845.62 --> 6846.82]  um
[6847.06 --> 6849.06]  Who was on it?
[6850.34 --> 6852.34]  Uh
[6852.34 --> 6854.34]  Okay, wow. Yeah, that's wild
[6855.46 --> 6857.46]  Does this still exist?
[6857.62 --> 6859.62]  Is this still a thing?
[6859.62 --> 6863.86]  Oh, yeah, no, the last thing they did was five years ago. Okay, uh, i'm okay
[6863.86 --> 6866.66]  Wait, who? KB mod? KB mod, yeah. Yeah, I don't think that's been a thing for a bit
[6867.46 --> 6869.46]  Okay, um
[6870.02 --> 6876.18]  PKA seems to still exist though. Oh, yeah, 100% they're talking about oj simpson
[6878.90 --> 6883.14]  Huh, all right. Well, uh, yeah, he like died. Yeah, yeah
[6884.90 --> 6886.90]  Neat karma's a bitch
[6890.90 --> 6894.02]  Probably took a little long let's do the next merch message, okay
[6894.02 --> 6896.74]  Let's do that. No, I want to lose my job
[6896.74 --> 6898.02]  The last of multiple minutes of this is
[6899.14 --> 6902.90]  Uh, let's see. Let's see. Um, maybe maybe they won't be the problem.
[6902.90 --> 6904.90]  Oh
[6904.90 --> 6906.90]  Maybe it'll just be you. Linus is gonna get them cancelled
[6906.90 --> 6908.74]  Yeah, my whole thought process here
[6908.74 --> 6913.94]  Is like the yard boys are gonna get Linus to go too far on something and now it's like, you know
[6913.94 --> 6914.90]  Luke can handle it
[6914.90 --> 6916.90]  Maybe maybe it'll be
[6917.62 --> 6919.62]  Linus getting the yard guys to go too far
[6919.62 --> 6923.14]  You and slime is gonna be a genuinely intriguing combination
[6926.34 --> 6928.34]  I'm excited. I'll definitely listen to that episode
[6928.34 --> 6935.06]  Next one. All right, let's see. Uh, how about a quick one? Hi, luke linus and dan tall sizes soon, please
[6935.06 --> 6937.54]  I beg you to give I want to give you my money
[6939.46 --> 6941.46]  Yes
[6942.18 --> 6949.30]  Hi, linus and luke, I work with a work with a non-profit and i'm looking to start a camp for kids on building computers
[6949.62 --> 6954.10]  How would you go about sourcing hardware without the option of electronics recycler?
[6954.10 --> 6960.82]  You don't um, there's just there's uh, it's not going to happen basically
[6961.22 --> 6963.94]  There's no one who's going to pony up that hardware
[6965.14 --> 6965.78]  Like why?
[6965.78 --> 6968.82]  Um, and if you're like, oh, well, I could just take older stuff
[6969.22 --> 6970.82]  They're gonna say well, where would I get that?
[6970.82 --> 6971.86]  Um
[6972.90 --> 6974.98]  At the kind of volumes that you would need
[6975.62 --> 6978.58]  Because the answer is going to be a hardware recycler
[6978.58 --> 6982.66]  So either you go to a hardware recycler or they go to a hardware recycler
[6982.66 --> 6985.46]  It's just um, it's just not gonna it's not gonna work
[6986.02 --> 6988.82]  Um, the cost of this stuff like I think that
[6989.78 --> 6993.78]  A lot of people have this perception that if something costs a hundred dollars well
[6994.66 --> 6997.86]  The matter like at the price the retail price is a hundred dollars
[6997.86 --> 7002.18]  Well, probably the manufacturing cost is what like 20 bucks like I see that I see that a lot
[7003.14 --> 7008.02]  Whether it's our screwdriver or whether it's uh, you know our own merch where I really do know the cost
[7008.02 --> 7014.42]  I know what they are um, or whether it's computer hardware product where I understand enough to understand the cost
[7014.42 --> 7016.26]  I see people have this perception that like
[7016.74 --> 7020.50]  I'm going to I'm spending five hundred dollars on a tv at best buy I'm getting ripped
[7020.50 --> 7023.30]  I'm getting ripped man five hundred dollars for a tv like
[7024.02 --> 7027.46]  Right, but it people who made it need to be paid
[7028.10 --> 7030.58]  And so that's that's how that works, right?
[7030.58 --> 7033.94]  Like the best buy does not have a ton of margin on a five hundred dollar tv
[7033.94 --> 7042.42]  I can tell you that with 100 confidence. Um, and so even at the manufacturing level the it industry is notoriously cutthroat
[7042.74 --> 7044.66]  for margins so they might have
[7046.82 --> 7052.26]  15 20 points on a motherboard so that hundred dollar motherboard is 80 bucks
[7052.26 --> 7054.10]  How many kids are you planning to have at this camp?
[7054.10 --> 7056.26]  I mean, it's not much of a camp unless it's like
[7056.90 --> 7060.02]  50 or something, right? Like what's what's a camp exactly to you?
[7060.02 --> 7064.58]  So they're going to give you what motherboards times 50 even if it's 20
[7065.14 --> 7070.58]  Like this is actually a ton of money you're asking for if you want computers for them to build
[7070.98 --> 7072.74]  so this is the kind of thing that over time
[7073.78 --> 7074.82]  you're going to have to
[7075.38 --> 7081.06]  acquire non-working hardware because if the goal is just for them to build it kind of more fun anyway doesn't have to function
[7081.70 --> 7082.26]  um
[7082.26 --> 7086.58]  Well, not even that so my i've told the story before but in high school my computers teacher
[7086.58 --> 7092.34]  Um found a way to acquire i'll speed through it partially found a way to acquire a whole bunch of
[7092.90 --> 7094.34]  Non-working pcs
[7094.82 --> 7099.94]  And then we we built a computer lab for the school out of these non-working pcs
[7100.26 --> 7106.26]  By sifting through them and finding what parts worked figured out what motherboards were working cpus working ram was working etc
[7106.26 --> 7111.38]  And building custom computers for this whole computer lab and it was great. It's a really fun experience
[7111.38 --> 7115.46]  You might be able to do that as well if there's like a recycler in the area that will allow you to
[7116.26 --> 7119.30]  Take some stuff for this experience, which might be a thing. I don't know
[7120.98 --> 7122.66]  And guys like
[7122.66 --> 7128.58]  It's there's no award for being wrong on the internet. I think twitch chat has lost their chat privileges for today
[7128.74 --> 7134.74]  It's terrible take line is saying this while these companies are making record profits guys best buys not making record profits
[7135.22 --> 7140.10]  It's not pandemic. It's not the pandemic anymore. People aren't buying computers. Yeah, your grocery store probably is
[7140.10 --> 7146.42]  But that doesn't mean that that's true of every single company. It's not it's not how these things work
[7148.42 --> 7150.10]  Industries
[7150.10 --> 7152.10]  bust and they boom
[7153.14 --> 7159.14]  And no like there there isn't a ton of money in being an electronics retailer if there was everyone would do it
[7159.14 --> 7163.14]  It wouldn't be consolidated down to just a handful of remaining options
[7164.98 --> 7166.98]  Little twitch anyway
[7170.10 --> 7172.10]  Uh sure. Yeah, let's do one more
[7172.42 --> 7179.30]  Hey, definitely not late dot DL. Oh, I heard a long time ago that having a hard drive at close to or at capacity
[7179.38 --> 7183.86]  Negatively affects performance of the drive. Is that still a thing with newer drives like m.2?
[7190.10 --> 7192.10]  Yeah
[7192.10 --> 7200.34]  Um, although for different reasons on hard drives the issue was the fragmentation of the files that would occur as they filled up over time
[7200.34 --> 7202.82]  So it as you installed a game
[7203.54 --> 7204.02]  um
[7204.02 --> 7210.98]  And then put some media files and then install another game and then put some dependencies that are needed for a game and and
[7211.30 --> 7215.22]  Essentially filled up the concentric circles that make up the platter
[7215.22 --> 7218.66]  Uh, you would end up with in many cases, um
[7219.14 --> 7223.86]  Applications or even individual files that had pieces of them kind of spread out all over the platter
[7223.86 --> 7227.30]  When you have officially or efficiently organized when you have a physical
[7227.54 --> 7231.14]  Needle that is moving back and forth seeking to access that data
[7231.14 --> 7234.90]  There's a delay as it goes around searching all over the disk for the pieces that it needs
[7234.90 --> 7237.62]  Uh, so what you would do is you would kind of
[7237.62 --> 7238.50]  Um
[7238.50 --> 7243.30]  Reorganize it to put all the data that goes together together to make it so that you're doing less seeking
[7244.02 --> 7246.02]  with ssds
[7246.02 --> 7252.34]  Everything is just handled on an address basis. There is no physical seeking time there. It does still take time
[7252.42 --> 7257.78]  But it's not from moving a physical object where you run into trouble with ssds is
[7258.34 --> 7260.58]  In the same in a similar way
[7262.58 --> 7264.58]  You can have
[7265.62 --> 7267.62]  Um
[7267.62 --> 7274.10]  You can have junk on the disk that isn't what you need. I shouldn't say disk because it's not a disk
[7274.10 --> 7277.62]  You can have junk on the drive that isn't what you need
[7278.18 --> 7281.30]  Um in a space that okay, I shouldn't say somewhere. It's not that similar
[7281.38 --> 7287.46]  So you can have junk on the drive that you don't need but hasn't been fully removed because that's not as efficient
[7287.46 --> 7288.18]  It's not as
[7289.06 --> 7297.14]  Good for the drives longevity because nand flash has a finite number of write cycles that it can survive before it just gives up the ghost
[7297.62 --> 7299.62]  So what happens is when you fill a drive
[7300.34 --> 7301.30]  you
[7301.30 --> 7302.26]  Uh
[7302.26 --> 7304.26]  And then and then delete a file
[7304.26 --> 7305.86]  It's just sort of shadow deleted
[7305.86 --> 7309.06]  It's not really deleted until such time as you actually need to
[7309.78 --> 7313.22]  Overwrite it until you actually need to fill up that space
[7313.54 --> 7316.34]  So what happens then is instead of just a write operation
[7316.34 --> 7318.50]  It needs to do a full
[7318.98 --> 7326.58]  Program array cycle it needs to actually wipe it then write it and in some cases having a really full drive can mean that there are
[7326.98 --> 7330.82]  Bits of data in some places and bits of data and other places that aren't consolidated
[7330.82 --> 7334.02]  Which is kind of similar ish to what we would see with hard drives
[7334.02 --> 7338.98]  And when the drives very full the odds that you're going to hit a block that needs to
[7339.94 --> 7340.50]  uh
[7340.50 --> 7342.18]  be erased and then
[7342.82 --> 7345.78]  Rewritten somewhere else and then written to
[7346.34 --> 7346.74]  um
[7347.54 --> 7354.50]  In order for it to stay organized is much much higher. This is like a super super crappy explanation of it
[7354.50 --> 7357.46]  But this is off the top of my head and I haven't looked at
[7358.02 --> 7360.02]  garbage collection trim and
[7360.34 --> 7360.74]  NAND
[7360.74 --> 7365.38]  I feel like this is a situation you should point to like a tech wiki or something
[7366.18 --> 7368.42]  I'm fairly certain we have tech wikis on these topics
[7372.26 --> 7378.82]  Basically, yes being more full means there's less room for this data organization to take place and it can be more delayed
[7379.46 --> 7382.98]  You can also have just annoyances with like temp file overflows and stuff like that
[7383.06 --> 7386.50]  And it's bad for the longevity of the drive as well because the more
[7386.50 --> 7391.38]  Shuffling it has to do for every right operation the more unnecessary writing that you're doing
[7399.14 --> 7399.46]  Dan
[7400.58 --> 7402.74]  Oh, are we doing topics now? Let's do it
[7403.22 --> 7408.34]  LTT labs nicholas if that is your if you're if you're who I think you are you should get a
[7409.22 --> 7410.58]  icon message me next week
[7410.58 --> 7412.58]  Oh
[7412.58 --> 7416.26]  Oh guest labs will just have to test drives at various levels of fill and wear I mean
[7417.30 --> 7419.30]  yeah, kind of
[7421.86 --> 7422.58]  Oh, that's great
[7422.58 --> 7424.34]  internalized screaming
[7424.90 --> 7426.26]  Texas schools
[7426.26 --> 7428.26]  embrace ai grading
[7428.26 --> 7436.02]  The texas education agency will be replacing human graders not fully replacing but certainly
[7436.98 --> 7437.94]  significantly
[7438.50 --> 7439.54]  augmenting
[7439.54 --> 7440.74]  I shouldn't say augmenting
[7440.74 --> 7443.30]  Well, they're replacing some the human graders are yeah some of them are gone
[7443.30 --> 7448.74]  Yeah, so we'll be replacing some of their human graders with an auto scoring engine
[7449.46 --> 7454.74]  And this is not for multiple choice. This is for written questions on standardized tests
[7454.74 --> 7458.02]  With the only exception being tests written in spanish
[7458.82 --> 7462.82]  If the ai indicates it has low confidence in its score
[7463.06 --> 7470.18]  The test will be referred to a human grader for review with the human grader score overruling the ai's if there's a disagreement between the two scores
[7470.98 --> 7472.18]  Texas estimates
[7473.62 --> 7480.02]  That 75 percent of tests will be graded without being sent for further review
[7480.82 --> 7484.82]  They estimate this will save 15 to 20 million dollars a year annually
[7485.46 --> 7489.70]  By hiring only a third as many temporary graders every year
[7490.26 --> 7496.74]  The state has insisted that while the auto scoring engine is based on similar technology to gpt4
[7496.74 --> 7498.74]  It will have systemic
[7499.46 --> 7507.70]  Systematic oversight from humans it won't learn from one response to the next but always defer to its original programming set up by the state
[7507.70 --> 7518.02]  It was apparently trained on 3 000 past tests that went through two rounds of review by human graders and is intended to give the same grade as a human
[7518.66 --> 7519.86]  would have
[7519.86 --> 7521.86]  the decision follows a
[7521.86 --> 7524.82]  2023 redesign of the star standardized
[7525.78 --> 7532.42]  Assignment assessment to include fewer multiple choice questions and six times more open-ended questions, which actually seems like a good idea having
[7533.06 --> 7536.34]  You know students answer with open-ended questions. I guess they're just like
[7536.34 --> 7541.86]  Well, um, this is a lot of work to grade. So I guess we'll just have a machine do it which
[7542.90 --> 7543.54]  um
[7543.54 --> 7550.26]  Yeah, critics have raised concerns that a machine may not be able to recognize and reward creativity or originality
[7551.38 --> 7554.26]  3 000 seems like not a lot of prior tests, huh?
[7554.98 --> 7560.58]  Honestly, no also a person one two three in full plane chat said this is even worse than it seems because those temporary graders
[7560.58 --> 7563.06]  I didn't put this together those temporary graders
[7563.62 --> 7568.90]  Who were losing their jobs were generally texas teachers trying to augment their crappy salaries
[7570.58 --> 7573.14]  Didn't think about that that makes sense. That's rough
[7574.98 --> 7575.30]  But
[7577.30 --> 7578.50]  Cool yeah
[7581.78 --> 7583.78]  Controversial take
[7583.78 --> 7590.34]  When did tax priorities shift from roads schools
[7591.06 --> 7591.54]  libraries
[7592.50 --> 7594.42]  First and then other stuff
[7595.06 --> 7596.26]  defense
[7596.26 --> 7599.06]  Realistically, it doesn't have to be like all of it, but there should be some
[7599.62 --> 7602.18]  when did it shift from that first then everything else
[7603.14 --> 7604.66]  to like
[7604.66 --> 7611.94]  Rando programs and vanity projects and then I guess if we have anything left over I guess we'll pay teachers something we can we can call some teachers
[7611.94 --> 7615.46]  When did when when when exactly did that happen?
[7616.58 --> 7616.90]  I don't know
[7617.86 --> 7621.38]  I'm just wondering just curious because like I pay a lot of taxes
[7622.10 --> 7623.38]  I wouldn't mind if they went to
[7624.66 --> 7626.66]  schools
[7626.82 --> 7630.82]  Schools seem cool. Trudeau's investing some billions of dollars in ai
[7632.26 --> 7637.22]  Yeah, but our government is also investing in subsidies for
[7637.22 --> 7644.26]  Homeowners instead of just allowing the market to fall so that people can actually afford the houses. They're just
[7644.98 --> 7646.18]  Giving rent subsidies
[7647.06 --> 7649.06]  That is actually not the solution
[7649.06 --> 7651.22]  It's totally to let the property values go up
[7651.46 --> 7654.02]  So the property taxes go up so you can give
[7654.58 --> 7660.90]  A pittance of that money to the people who now have unaffordable rent so they can give more money to land landowners
[7661.22 --> 7664.18]  Brilliant who can then pay more property taxes. It's great
[7664.18 --> 7669.78]  It's a perpetual motion machine. Good job flawless flawless victory stupid
[7671.22 --> 7671.94]  I
[7671.94 --> 7677.38]  I wouldn't necessarily have a huge problem with this if I think we were like
[7678.34 --> 7680.02]  Way down the line from where we are now
[7681.22 --> 7683.62]  This is way massively too early
[7683.62 --> 7689.62]  You can't put this stuff in a position where it could have any amount of impact on someone's future
[7690.18 --> 7690.58]  um
[7690.58 --> 7697.30]  Because it's like oh, yeah humans will grade it if if you know it has a low confidence
[7697.78 --> 7702.10]  But what if it is highly confidently incorrect which we have seen many times
[7705.70 --> 7709.38]  And then if you can dispute it and it will be graded by a real person
[7709.86 --> 7713.46]  Then everyone's gonna just dispute it and you didn't gain anything anyways
[7716.98 --> 7717.38]  I don't know
[7717.38 --> 7719.38]  I don't know
[7719.70 --> 7720.10]  Dumb
[7720.82 --> 7721.38]  Next topic
[7722.74 --> 7723.06]  Sure
[7724.42 --> 7726.34]  What's happening with youtube playables?
[7727.14 --> 7734.90]  At some point last year youtube added playables games that you can play directly on the platform via desktop or mobile devices as an experimental feature
[7735.22 --> 7742.18]  According to youtube's experiments page playables were supposed to be available until the 28th of march of this year
[7742.18 --> 7748.50]  However, there's still a support page for playables and they are still accessible on both desktop and android devices
[7748.82 --> 7753.94]  At the time of writing this based on reporting and this post which i'm assuming he's loading up
[7754.74 --> 7756.90]  No, he's not from the ltd subreddit
[7757.22 --> 7760.66]  Not many people seem to know youtube playables even exist
[7760.98 --> 7766.66]  Possibly because they seem to be only accessible through the explore section of youtube site and mobile app
[7766.98 --> 7768.82]  Which I?
[7768.82 --> 7770.82]  I don't think i've ever clicked on in my life
[7772.02 --> 7773.70]  Discussion question why do these exist?
[7773.78 --> 7775.70]  Why didn't youtube kill them when they said they would?
[7776.02 --> 7781.70]  What does this seeming ignorance surrounding the existence of playables say about youtube's ui ux?
[7781.70 --> 7786.74]  I don't know but i'm enraptured
[7787.70 --> 7789.38]  This game does not look fun
[7790.02 --> 7790.74]  What is that?
[7792.26 --> 7793.06]  You draw new legs?
[7793.06 --> 7794.02]  You draw the legs yeah
[7795.70 --> 7798.34]  Okay, that that actually sounds a little bit more fun than i thought
[7798.34 --> 7800.98]  It's playable i claimed 10 coin units
[7800.98 --> 7802.34]  What does that mean? What do you use those for?
[7802.34 --> 7802.74]  I don't know
[7802.74 --> 7804.34]  How do you buy more of them?
[7804.34 --> 7807.70]  Speed level 15 searching for an opponent
[7808.26 --> 7809.70]  No way it's multiplayer
[7809.70 --> 7811.70]  Whoa that guy's got like spring legs
[7811.70 --> 7812.34]  Okay
[7812.34 --> 7813.14]  Do your legs suck?
[7814.26 --> 7814.66]  Oh
[7815.22 --> 7815.86]  Okay, let's go
[7817.06 --> 7817.78]  Let's go
[7817.78 --> 7818.18]  Come on
[7818.74 --> 7819.30]  Give me some
[7819.94 --> 7820.42]  Let's go
[7820.42 --> 7820.98]  Oh
[7821.54 --> 7821.94]  Let's go
[7821.94 --> 7822.58]  I want a piece
[7822.58 --> 7823.54]  Wait did your leg break?
[7823.54 --> 7824.26]  What happened to my leg?
[7824.26 --> 7825.06]  Did my leg break?
[7826.10 --> 7827.54]  Can you draw new legs at any time?
[7827.54 --> 7829.06]  I need longer legs is what I need
[7829.06 --> 7829.62]  Boom
[7829.62 --> 7831.62]  Ba ba ba ba ba
[7831.62 --> 7832.98]  Oh i'm getting tuned here
[7832.98 --> 7834.18]  So you can draw new ones at any time
[7834.18 --> 7834.90]  I'm going fast
[7834.90 --> 7838.98]  So there's probably some theory to changing your legs depending on the terrain
[7838.98 --> 7839.38]  Yeah
[7840.42 --> 7841.14]  You got school
[7841.14 --> 7843.86]  I think you want shorter legs for going uphill
[7843.86 --> 7845.14]  I'm suddenly interested in this game
[7845.14 --> 7846.90]  Wait you can level up your speed though?
[7846.90 --> 7847.78]  That seems stupid
[7848.34 --> 7848.82]  Oh
[7848.82 --> 7850.82]  So other people just have like better speed?
[7850.82 --> 7851.14]  Maybe
[7851.14 --> 7852.82]  Wait am I just playing the same guy?
[7853.62 --> 7854.50]  That's stupid
[7854.50 --> 7856.02]  Or maybe it's just an AI
[7856.58 --> 7857.22]  Like a bot
[7858.58 --> 7859.14]  What's happening?
[7859.14 --> 7861.94]  Oh no it has to be an AI because it slows down while I'm drawing
[7862.82 --> 7863.06]  Well
[7863.94 --> 7868.50]  Well no not necessarily because they could record the inputs from the other players so they don't have to match like
[7869.38 --> 7869.86]  Yeah
[7869.86 --> 7870.90]  Oh I see what you mean
[7870.90 --> 7871.06]  Yeah
[7871.86 --> 7873.70]  So wait it's just going to stay slow
[7874.50 --> 7878.18]  While I decide when I want to put my small legs on
[7878.74 --> 7879.62]  Infinite slow-mo
[7879.62 --> 7881.78]  Because I'm like yeah this this seems like a hack
[7881.78 --> 7885.30]  Like an early 2000s game that you're doing built-in pre-made cheats on
[7885.94 --> 7886.82]  Yeah, exactly
[7886.82 --> 7888.26]  Also, why do I not fall?
[7888.26 --> 7890.18]  Does gravity no longer apply?
[7890.18 --> 7890.82]  All your bases are blown to us
[7890.82 --> 7893.14]  Do you just win the game because you went slow-mo?
[7894.10 --> 7894.82]  I think so
[7894.82 --> 7896.90]  I think if I just keep this held
[7897.78 --> 7899.30]  That's so sick
[7899.30 --> 7900.34]  I will not fall
[7901.14 --> 7902.18]  That's so cool
[7902.18 --> 7903.14]  Dude am I falling?
[7903.14 --> 7903.70]  I genuinely love that
[7903.70 --> 7904.34]  I don't think so
[7905.78 --> 7908.10]  Apparently I'm falling slowly says the chat
[7908.10 --> 7908.58]  Are you?
[7908.58 --> 7909.62]  But I'm not sure if I
[7909.62 --> 7910.90]  I'm not sure if I believe it
[7910.90 --> 7912.66]  It really doesn't seem like it
[7912.66 --> 7914.42]  I think I fell a lot faster before
[7914.42 --> 7915.14]  Yeah, exactly
[7915.14 --> 7916.82]  I don't think you were this high up before
[7916.82 --> 7918.98]  So there's there's at least some amount of effect
[7918.98 --> 7920.26]  Whether or not it's like
[7921.30 --> 7921.54]  You know
[7921.54 --> 7922.98]  Super noticeable or not
[7922.98 --> 7923.38]  I don't know
[7923.38 --> 7926.82]  Urban Fervor says I have a career in playtesting
[7926.82 --> 7927.30]  Yeah, this
[7927.70 --> 7930.02]  Man, I broke this game faster than I break Linux
[7931.38 --> 7931.94]  Are you sure?
[7931.94 --> 7933.14]  Yeah, I think so
[7933.14 --> 7938.10]  It took me a little while to break Linux the last couple of times I broke it
[7938.10 --> 7938.90]  Yeah, fair enough
[7939.94 --> 7941.46]  Like I am not falling guys
[7941.46 --> 7942.10]  I'm gonna win this
[7942.10 --> 7944.10]  Now is your leg gonna collide with this portion?
[7944.10 --> 7945.06]  No, I don't think so
[7945.06 --> 7946.50]  I'm pretty sure I'm still above it
[7947.30 --> 7949.62]  Danny's got nothing on me
[7949.62 --> 7949.86]  Yeah
[7951.22 --> 7952.66]  I'm so engaged right now
[7952.66 --> 7952.90]  See?
[7952.90 --> 7954.18]  Oh, it gets pretty close
[7954.18 --> 7954.98]  I think, I think
[7954.98 --> 7956.10]  Hold on, wait for it
[7956.10 --> 7956.98]  I think it might
[7957.62 --> 7958.50]  No, no
[7958.50 --> 7959.62]  Are they both the same length?
[7959.62 --> 7960.02]  Oh, yeah
[7960.02 --> 7960.50]  Oh, it did
[7960.50 --> 7961.38]  Oh, speed boost
[7961.38 --> 7963.38]  Let's go
[7963.38 --> 7964.26]  That's huge
[7964.26 --> 7965.14]  Hold on, is it gonna catch it?
[7965.14 --> 7966.18]  Is it gonna catch it?
[7966.18 --> 7967.70]  I no longer think so
[7969.22 --> 7970.02]  Right by it
[7971.06 --> 7972.50]  You're going fast now though
[7975.30 --> 7978.58]  So Danny seems to have his own glitch problem
[7978.58 --> 7981.94]  This is my favorite part of the show so far I think
[7981.94 --> 7983.14]  This is awesome
[7983.14 --> 7987.54]  I love that we have so many people watching you just like float
[7989.54 --> 7990.98]  Very slowly through the air
[7990.98 --> 7992.98]  I might say they're in a plane
[7992.98 --> 7993.46]  Oh
[7993.46 --> 7994.50]  Heyo
[7995.30 --> 7995.86]  So good
[7996.90 --> 7998.18]  I'm invested at this point though
[7998.18 --> 7999.22]  I want to see
[7999.22 --> 8000.90]  What on earth is going on?
[8000.90 --> 8002.82]  So this is a YouTube playable
[8003.62 --> 8004.82]  Something that I mean
[8004.82 --> 8006.18]  I didn't know they existed at all
[8006.18 --> 8008.42]  And apparently a lot of other people didn't know they existed either
[8008.42 --> 8012.18]  Because they were tucked away under the explore button on YouTube
[8012.18 --> 8014.18]  Which I suspect most people didn't click on
[8014.18 --> 8016.02]  There was a discussion question which is
[8016.02 --> 8017.46]  What does this seemingly
[8017.46 --> 8021.22]  Seeming ignorance surrounding the existence of playables say about YouTube's UI UX
[8021.22 --> 8023.86]  And in my opinion they just have so much stuff going on
[8023.86 --> 8026.82]  That adding things like this it's very hard to get visibility on it
[8026.82 --> 8028.90]  Why can't I be watching a short at the same time?
[8030.26 --> 8031.54]  This is a missed opportunity
[8031.54 --> 8031.94]  Honestly
[8032.90 --> 8035.22]  If they had short auto-scrolling
[8036.02 --> 8039.46]  Where after it finished playing one video it would just scroll to the next
[8039.46 --> 8041.54]  And you could play these playables on the side
[8042.02 --> 8043.46]  Move over subway surfers
[8043.46 --> 8044.66]  I bet you it would kill
[8045.38 --> 8046.50]  I don't think I would sleep
[8049.94 --> 8050.34]  Yeah
[8051.06 --> 8051.62]  I um
[8052.02 --> 8055.94]  Honestly, I'm sort of at the point now where I just kind of wish that YouTube would
[8056.90 --> 8057.86]  Do what it does?
[8057.86 --> 8058.50]  Holy crap
[8058.50 --> 8059.54]  It glitched in a new way
[8060.26 --> 8061.46]  I'm not moving anymore
[8062.82 --> 8063.22]  Uh oh
[8063.86 --> 8064.74]  I am static
[8064.74 --> 8066.02]  Are we both static?
[8066.90 --> 8068.10]  You can see the bar at the top
[8068.10 --> 8068.90]  Oh no, he's moving
[8068.90 --> 8069.46]  He's moving
[8069.46 --> 8070.02]  I'm not moving
[8070.02 --> 8070.34]  Okay
[8071.70 --> 8072.10]  Oh no
[8073.78 --> 8074.90]  Look it has line of size legs
[8074.90 --> 8076.10]  Oh, it's gonna be you
[8076.10 --> 8077.06]  Whoa, he's flying
[8077.06 --> 8078.02]  After all that
[8078.02 --> 8078.26]  No
[8079.94 --> 8080.18]  No
[8081.30 --> 8082.02]  No, no, I got this
[8082.02 --> 8082.82]  I got this
[8082.82 --> 8082.90]  No
[8082.90 --> 8083.62]  Are you kidding me?
[8083.62 --> 8083.94]  No
[8083.94 --> 8085.62]  No
[8085.62 --> 8086.66]  Okay, that wasn't cool
[8088.26 --> 8089.94]  All my hopes and dreams are gone
[8090.66 --> 8090.98]  Well
[8091.78 --> 8092.18]  All right
[8092.98 --> 8094.98]  I think that was my last attempt at that
[8094.98 --> 8095.22]  Yep
[8096.10 --> 8096.82]  So these are
[8096.82 --> 8097.78]  These are the games
[8097.78 --> 8098.10]  Is there no way
[8098.10 --> 8098.66]  Is this it?
[8098.66 --> 8101.22]  There's no microtransactions or anything even?
[8101.22 --> 8101.70]  I don't know
[8102.66 --> 8103.38]  Well, for now
[8103.38 --> 8104.90]  Like who's making these?
[8104.90 --> 8105.62]  I don't understand
[8105.62 --> 8106.90]  Bazooka boy
[8106.90 --> 8108.26]  Drag to aim, release to shoot
[8108.26 --> 8108.58]  I mean
[8109.62 --> 8110.10]  Uh
[8110.10 --> 8111.14]  But sure
[8111.14 --> 8112.58]  Wait, so they have
[8112.58 --> 8117.30]  YouTube officially has a game with explosions and you kill people
[8117.30 --> 8118.42]  There's a lot of blood as well
[8118.42 --> 8120.74]  Yeah, but like it's angry birds, Luke
[8120.74 --> 8121.62]  Yeah, but there's blood
[8121.62 --> 8122.90]  I mean, spurting blood
[8122.90 --> 8123.78]  He's dismembered
[8123.78 --> 8125.54]  And you shot someone with an RPG
[8126.26 --> 8128.74]  YouTube is full of all kinds of things
[8129.14 --> 8131.78]  Yeah, but they like don't want to be full of this stuff
[8132.34 --> 8132.90]  They don't?
[8132.90 --> 8134.42]  But then they have video games of it
[8134.42 --> 8134.98]  I don't know
[8134.98 --> 8137.86]  I think that YouTube mostly
[8137.86 --> 8138.74]  Oh yeah, lob it
[8138.74 --> 8142.42]  It has on it whatever it needs to have on it
[8142.42 --> 8145.06]  This guy played flash games in the 2000s
[8145.06 --> 8146.02]  Yeah, boys
[8146.02 --> 8147.06]  This man worms
[8147.06 --> 8147.78]  Oh
[8147.78 --> 8150.18]  Well, you are failed
[8150.18 --> 8151.22]  Okay, hold on a second
[8151.22 --> 8153.62]  Where are these games even coming from?
[8153.62 --> 8154.58]  Game over, yeah
[8154.58 --> 8159.06]  You are failed
[8159.06 --> 8160.42]  Oh no
[8160.42 --> 8162.82]  Want to crush me at chess?
[8163.58 --> 8163.94]  No
[8163.94 --> 8165.14]  I'm terrible
[8165.14 --> 8166.10]  I don't
[8166.10 --> 8167.20]  I haven't played in a long time
[8167.20 --> 8168.56]  I'd be really bad too
[8168.56 --> 8169.84]  There's no way you're worse than me
[8169.84 --> 8171.76]  I fall off so fast, it's weird
[8171.76 --> 8173.76]  No man, there's no way you're worse than me
[8173.76 --> 8174.40]  It's weird
[8174.40 --> 8175.76]  Running pet deck room
[8175.76 --> 8176.88]  What is this?
[8177.76 --> 8178.64]  Who made these games?
[8178.64 --> 8181.20]  I think I got to like 1100 or 1200 or something
[8181.20 --> 8183.68]  And then stopped playing and just sort of fell off
[8183.68 --> 8185.44]  I think I got to 11 or 12
[8186.08 --> 8186.40]  No
[8186.40 --> 8187.52]  Years old
[8187.52 --> 8187.76]  Oh
[8188.32 --> 8188.88]  Yeah
[8188.88 --> 8190.40]  Like honestly, there's no way
[8192.32 --> 8193.36]  Tap to play
[8193.36 --> 8193.68]  Roll
[8193.68 --> 8194.32]  Whoa
[8194.32 --> 8195.28]  Oh laggy
[8195.28 --> 8196.00]  Whoa
[8196.00 --> 8196.96]  Is it laggy on your screen?
[8196.96 --> 8197.48]  Oh yeah
[8197.48 --> 8198.80]  Oh buddy
[8198.80 --> 8199.36]  Oh
[8199.36 --> 8200.32]  What the
[8200.32 --> 8201.14]  What is happening?
[8201.58 --> 8201.92]  Jump
[8201.92 --> 8202.52]  Can you jump
[8202.52 --> 8203.28]  Or crouch, sorry
[8203.28 --> 8204.82]  Down arrow?
[8205.60 --> 8206.00]  No
[8206.00 --> 8206.80]  S
[8206.80 --> 8207.12]  Oh
[8207.12 --> 8208.80]  Okay
[8208.80 --> 8209.20]  W
[8209.20 --> 8210.40]  Or up arrow
[8210.40 --> 8210.90]  Yeah, okay
[8210.90 --> 8212.24]  So yeah, the arrows work
[8212.24 --> 8215.10]  On the ramp
[8215.10 --> 8216.14]  Woo
[8216.14 --> 8217.46]  Wait, I can't
[8217.46 --> 8219.48]  You're Sonic the cat
[8219.48 --> 8220.46]  Wait, I can't
[8220.46 --> 8222.18]  Wait, what the
[8222.18 --> 8222.64]  Oh
[8222.64 --> 8223.56]  Dang
[8223.56 --> 8224.80]  Hold on
[8224.80 --> 8224.82]  Hold on
[8224.82 --> 8225.60]  I'm so confused
[8225.60 --> 8226.94]  Sometimes the arrow keys work
[8226.94 --> 8228.40]  Sometimes they don't
[8228.40 --> 8230.34]  Tap here to build a room
[8230.34 --> 8232.28]  The arrow keys are not working right now
[8232.28 --> 8233.06]  Build a room
[8233.06 --> 8234.00]  What?
[8234.04 --> 8234.80]  I don't want to build a room
[8234.80 --> 8236.02]  Get a room
[8236.02 --> 8237.34]  Oh, I don't care
[8237.34 --> 8237.84]  Oh
[8237.84 --> 8239.60]  I have to buy a sofa
[8239.60 --> 8241.74]  Oh, I think this one has premium currency
[8241.74 --> 8243.04]  Oh my god
[8243.04 --> 8243.76]  Oh, check that out
[8243.76 --> 8245.64]  At the top, the diamonds
[8245.64 --> 8246.36]  Wait, don't
[8246.36 --> 8248.08]  You might have things connected to this laptop
[8248.08 --> 8248.54]  Oh yeah, don't do that
[8248.54 --> 8249.70]  Because you refuse to follow rules
[8249.70 --> 8251.44]  Okay, selected
[8251.44 --> 8252.96]  Roll?
[8253.34 --> 8254.24]  Like, do they mean like
[8254.24 --> 8254.94]  Avatar?
[8256.38 --> 8257.38]  How do I play?
[8257.54 --> 8258.02]  Just, okay
[8258.02 --> 8258.60]  Tap to play
[8258.60 --> 8259.36]  Okay, here we go
[8259.36 --> 8259.72]  Here we go
[8259.72 --> 8260.70]  Okay, okay
[8260.70 --> 8262.08]  The controls are working now
[8262.08 --> 8263.02]  So that's a big improvement
[8263.02 --> 8264.94]  Oh, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops
[8264.94 --> 8266.18]  Okay, so can I
[8266.18 --> 8268.08]  Okay, but why would I do that
[8268.08 --> 8269.46]  Instead of just going for the coins?
[8270.36 --> 8271.32]  Like, that seems stupid
[8271.32 --> 8272.88]  I mean, sometimes it might make sense
[8272.88 --> 8273.78]  Can I jump over
[8273.78 --> 8274.44]  Okay, yeah
[8274.44 --> 8275.40]  Can I jump over this car?
[8275.50 --> 8275.98]  Yeah, I can
[8275.98 --> 8276.66]  Yeah, dog
[8276.66 --> 8277.46]  Let's go
[8277.46 --> 8278.32]  Jump from thing to thing
[8278.32 --> 8278.58]  Woo!
[8278.92 --> 8280.06]  Oh, I bet
[8280.06 --> 8281.44]  You better press it twice, though
[8281.44 --> 8282.70]  Ah, interesting
[8282.70 --> 8283.34]  You can't hold it
[8283.34 --> 8284.76]  Oh, I pressed both
[8284.76 --> 8286.08]  This keyboard is really not
[8286.08 --> 8287.32]  In the ideal configuration
[8287.32 --> 8287.78]  For gaming
[8287.78 --> 8288.56]  It has one of those
[8288.56 --> 8288.96]  Yeah
[8288.96 --> 8290.20]  Combined up and downs
[8290.20 --> 8291.16]  So, anyway
[8291.16 --> 8291.58]  Single height
[8291.58 --> 8292.28]  Back to
[8292.28 --> 8293.92]  Back to playables
[8293.92 --> 8294.44]  Yeah
[8294.44 --> 8295.50]  Yeah
[8295.50 --> 8296.92]  So that's something they have
[8296.92 --> 8300.48]  I feel like YouTube is just kind of losing its identity a little bit
[8300.48 --> 8302.06]  And I've felt this way about
[8302.06 --> 8308.56]  Yeah, everything from stories to shorts to being a place to rent movies
[8308.56 --> 8310.10]  Like, I just, I kind of don't
[8310.10 --> 8315.70]  I kind of don't understand what YouTube wants to be
[8315.70 --> 8317.70]  Why not just be YouTube?
[8317.70 --> 8318.94]  If it's all video
[8318.94 --> 8320.44]  I sort of get it
[8320.44 --> 8321.48]  I blame capitalism
[8321.48 --> 8326.84]  Because the only way to have infinite growth is to have infinite number of products
[8326.84 --> 8330.66]  At a certain point, you're going to be saturated in terms of what you can serve for
[8330.66 --> 8331.10]  Yeah
[8331.10 --> 8332.70]  For long format video
[8332.70 --> 8335.18]  But that's not what investors demand
[8335.18 --> 8336.68]  Investors demand growth
[8336.68 --> 8337.76]  And when you already
[8337.76 --> 8338.80]  I mean, YouTube at some point
[8338.80 --> 8339.14]  I forget
[8339.14 --> 8340.30]  This was like four or five years ago
[8340.30 --> 8344.08]  Stopped regularly talking about their growth in daily active users
[8344.08 --> 8345.34]  Because it was like over a billion
[8345.34 --> 8345.96]  It's like, well
[8345.96 --> 8347.28]  Or not daily, monthly
[8347.28 --> 8348.10]  Or whatever it was
[8348.10 --> 8349.94]  They stopped talking about it regularly
[8349.94 --> 8350.98]  And it's just like
[8350.98 --> 8353.00]  Like if we want more people on the platform
[8353.00 --> 8354.70]  We need the world to birth more people
[8354.70 --> 8356.40]  Yeah, the only way for us to grow
[8356.40 --> 8358.06]  Is to extract more value
[8358.06 --> 8360.14]  Out of the people that exist
[8360.14 --> 8362.26]  Rather than hoping that there will be more at some point
[8362.26 --> 8362.76]  And it's just
[8362.76 --> 8364.78]  I don't know
[8364.78 --> 8365.84]  It kind of sucks
[8365.84 --> 8368.24]  Apparently the currency
[8368.24 --> 8370.16]  There's no microtransactions
[8370.16 --> 8371.44]  Apparently
[8371.44 --> 8373.92]  Yet
[8373.92 --> 8375.34]  Yeah
[8375.34 --> 8377.60]  I'm sure the whole thing is positioned for that
[8377.60 --> 8378.14]  Hurts
[8378.14 --> 8380.00]  Just these test schemes don't have any
[8380.00 --> 8381.18]  I'm hurt
[8381.18 --> 8382.12]  In better news
[8382.12 --> 8383.04]  Roku
[8383.04 --> 8385.32]  Has filed a patent for a technology
[8385.32 --> 8387.30]  That would allow its TVs to detect
[8387.30 --> 8388.90]  When you've paused a device
[8388.90 --> 8390.28]  That's connected via HDMI
[8390.28 --> 8391.88]  Such as a game console
[8391.88 --> 8394.50]  So the TV can show you ads
[8394.50 --> 8396.20]  Can you
[8396.20 --> 8396.88]  Can you
[8396.88 --> 8397.70]  We've already talked about this
[8397.70 --> 8398.26]  Can you
[8398.26 --> 8400.02]  Can you file a patent
[8400.02 --> 8401.22]  We've totally talked about this
[8401.22 --> 8402.62]  Can you file a patent
[8402.62 --> 8404.46]  And then
[8404.46 --> 8405.36]  Can you like
[8405.36 --> 8406.38]  File a patent
[8406.38 --> 8407.88]  So that no one can do a thing
[8407.88 --> 8410.42]  I mean I guess
[8410.42 --> 8411.88]  Like could you file this patent
[8411.88 --> 8412.66]  And then be like
[8412.66 --> 8413.58]  Yeah we filed this patent
[8413.58 --> 8414.32]  Because we
[8414.32 --> 8415.64]  Thought someone might do this
[8415.64 --> 8416.10]  And we were like
[8416.10 --> 8416.38]  Nah
[8416.38 --> 8417.24]  It's really
[8417.24 --> 8419.12]  I shouldn't say really expensive
[8419.12 --> 8420.86]  But it does cost money and time
[8420.86 --> 8422.48]  To file patents
[8422.48 --> 8424.36]  And filing defensive patents
[8424.36 --> 8425.60]  On behalf of
[8425.60 --> 8426.66]  Consumers
[8426.66 --> 8428.20]  Would probably be
[8428.20 --> 8429.44]  A fruitless endeavor
[8429.44 --> 8429.94]  Yeah
[8429.94 --> 8431.32]  Given the ease
[8431.32 --> 8432.28]  With which
[8432.28 --> 8433.30]  Large companies
[8433.30 --> 8434.24]  Can sort of
[8434.24 --> 8436.42]  Look if they can get around
[8436.42 --> 8437.24]  Each other's patents
[8437.24 --> 8438.48]  They can get around yours
[8438.48 --> 8439.92]  Is all I have to say about that
[8439.92 --> 8441.48]  And they have a lot more resources
[8441.48 --> 8442.26]  To do it
[8442.26 --> 8443.68]  I wasn't suggesting
[8443.68 --> 8444.70]  This is a thing that we do
[8444.70 --> 8445.44]  To be very clear
[8445.44 --> 8445.86]  Cool
[8445.86 --> 8446.38]  Yeah
[8446.38 --> 8446.86]  Yeah
[8446.86 --> 8447.94]  No I do not have
[8447.94 --> 8449.40]  Unlimited money to do that
[8449.40 --> 8451.02]  It was not the goal at all
[8451.02 --> 8453.38]  Goldball says I donate to that cause
[8453.38 --> 8454.36]  I was trying to make a joke
[8454.36 --> 8454.76]  About like
[8454.76 --> 8455.82]  Maybe they're doing this
[8455.82 --> 8456.62]  Knowing that they weren't
[8456.62 --> 8459.08]  So like a crowd sourced
[8459.08 --> 8461.14]  A crowd sourced
[8461.14 --> 8463.14]  Or like crowd funded
[8463.14 --> 8465.00]  Organization
[8465.00 --> 8466.20]  Like a not for profit
[8466.20 --> 8467.04]  That basically
[8467.04 --> 8468.62]  Preemptively files patents
[8468.62 --> 8470.12]  For terrible ideas
[8470.12 --> 8471.76]  That are anti-consumer
[8471.76 --> 8475.70]  I still don't think it would work
[8475.70 --> 8476.36]  It would be funny
[8476.36 --> 8480.48]  Yeah was that a topic in the top?
[8480.56 --> 8481.96]  Cause we absolutely talked about that last week
[8481.96 --> 8483.40]  Or a previous week
[8483.40 --> 8485.04]  Did we?
[8486.10 --> 8487.02]  Oh I didn't think we did
[8487.02 --> 8488.22]  Well whatever
[8488.22 --> 8489.20]  In case anyone missed it
[8489.20 --> 8489.72]  Like I did
[8489.72 --> 8491.34]  In addition to detecting
[8491.34 --> 8492.18]  When you've paused
[8492.18 --> 8493.60]  The patent also suggests
[8493.60 --> 8494.72]  Methods to identify
[8494.72 --> 8496.00]  What was displayed
[8496.00 --> 8497.36]  In the frame
[8497.36 --> 8498.58]  Before you paused
[8498.58 --> 8500.30]  And use that information
[8500.30 --> 8501.04]  To show you
[8501.04 --> 8502.64]  More relevant ads
[8502.64 --> 8503.26]  I don't think we had
[8503.26 --> 8503.96]  That information
[8503.96 --> 8505.16]  I think we knew
[8505.16 --> 8506.40]  That they were doing something
[8506.40 --> 8507.82]  With ads and consoles
[8507.82 --> 8508.62]  And stuff like that
[8508.62 --> 8509.00]  So
[8509.00 --> 8510.64]  So you guys know
[8510.64 --> 8512.64]  If this is implemented
[8512.64 --> 8513.74]  You could be using
[8513.74 --> 8515.14]  Your Roku brand TV
[8515.14 --> 8516.64]  As just a display
[8516.64 --> 8517.70]  Okay
[8517.70 --> 8518.44]  You could be
[8518.44 --> 8519.94]  Completely ignoring
[8519.94 --> 8520.76]  Roku's
[8520.76 --> 8521.98]  Streaming services
[8521.98 --> 8522.66]  Software
[8522.66 --> 8524.32]  And their smartness
[8524.32 --> 8525.06]  And all that stuff
[8525.06 --> 8526.62]  But
[8526.62 --> 8528.16]  Another device
[8528.16 --> 8528.92]  That is plugged
[8528.92 --> 8530.00]  Into one of the TV's
[8530.00 --> 8530.90]  HDMI ports
[8530.90 --> 8532.44]  Could be
[8532.44 --> 8533.46]  Red
[8533.46 --> 8534.14]  Essentially
[8534.14 --> 8535.20]  Like what was on it
[8535.20 --> 8536.48]  You could be watching
[8536.48 --> 8538.00]  Something
[8538.00 --> 8539.14]  Intimate
[8539.14 --> 8540.32]  For example
[8540.32 --> 8542.44]  And that could be used
[8542.44 --> 8543.18]  To serve you
[8543.18 --> 8543.84]  A targeted
[8543.84 --> 8544.58]  Ad
[8544.58 --> 8547.72]  What would the
[8547.72 --> 8548.54]  Targeted ad
[8548.54 --> 8549.12]  Be for
[8549.12 --> 8549.72]  If you were
[8549.72 --> 8550.42]  Watching something
[8550.42 --> 8551.60]  Intimate on your TV
[8551.60 --> 8553.22]  Like a dating service
[8553.22 --> 8554.50]  There's kids watching
[8554.50 --> 8554.82]  Okay
[8554.82 --> 8555.40]  Stop
[8555.40 --> 8559.90]  It'd be something
[8559.90 --> 8561.04]  It'd be fun to think about
[8561.04 --> 8561.68]  It'd be something
[8561.68 --> 8562.30]  And it would be
[8562.30 --> 8563.46]  Somewhere in between
[8563.46 --> 8564.36]  You know
[8564.36 --> 8565.20]  A hard solid
[8565.20 --> 8566.30]  And a liquid
[8566.30 --> 8570.98]  Nice
[8570.98 --> 8572.04]  Thanks
[8572.04 --> 8572.84]  That's pretty good
[8572.84 --> 8573.20]  Thanks
[8573.20 --> 8574.24]  Moving on
[8574.24 --> 8575.84]  Hot singles in your area
[8575.84 --> 8577.08]  Man so many of the ads
[8577.08 --> 8577.94]  I get served for that
[8577.94 --> 8579.90]  Like the second I hit my mid-30s
[8579.90 --> 8581.14]  I was like
[8581.14 --> 8582.28]  Do you want to have an affair?
[8582.84 --> 8583.50]  It's like how many times
[8583.50 --> 8584.04]  I have to tell you
[8584.04 --> 8584.68]  No I'm good
[8584.68 --> 8585.62]  Thank you
[8585.62 --> 8587.24]  But you might today
[8587.24 --> 8587.88]  Yeah but
[8587.88 --> 8588.68]  But look how hot
[8588.68 --> 8589.88]  The women in your area are
[8589.88 --> 8590.80]  I'm like those aren't real
[8590.80 --> 8592.96]  I've seen
[8592.96 --> 8594.14]  I've seen the women in my area
[8594.14 --> 8594.58]  No no
[8594.58 --> 8596.28]  That's just a joke
[8596.28 --> 8597.04]  Wait when I travel
[8597.04 --> 8598.74]  The pictures of the women in my area
[8598.74 --> 8599.56]  Are the same
[8599.56 --> 8600.02]  Yes
[8600.02 --> 8600.76]  What does this mean?
[8600.78 --> 8601.88]  I've seen the women in my area
[8601.88 --> 8602.90]  And they're not this person
[8602.90 --> 8604.04]  That's not to say
[8604.04 --> 8605.18]  They don't seem great
[8605.18 --> 8607.02]  Good personalities
[8607.02 --> 8608.46]  You know
[8608.46 --> 8609.48]  Healthy hair
[8609.48 --> 8612.96]  Nice
[8612.96 --> 8614.58]  What minus one's in a woman?
[8615.94 --> 8617.38]  Is your hair healthy?
[8617.80 --> 8619.26]  It's extremely important to me
[8619.26 --> 8620.34]  It's sorry
[8620.34 --> 8622.04]  It's a Bob's Burgers reference
[8622.04 --> 8622.36]  Sorry
[8622.36 --> 8623.70]  We get along really well
[8623.70 --> 8625.18]  But you just have too many split ends
[8625.18 --> 8625.56]  Yeah
[8625.56 --> 8627.94]  Look okay
[8627.94 --> 8628.84]  I need to explain this
[8628.84 --> 8630.10]  It's a Bob's Burgers reference
[8630.10 --> 8630.44]  Okay
[8630.44 --> 8632.48]  Louise is trying to get
[8632.48 --> 8634.48]  Pockets
[8634.48 --> 8635.92]  No regular size Rudy
[8635.92 --> 8637.32]  To not have a crush on her
[8637.32 --> 8638.40]  And she's like
[8638.40 --> 8640.24]  Do you like eating boogers?
[8640.30 --> 8641.58]  I eat my boogers all the time
[8641.58 --> 8642.42]  And he basically goes
[8642.42 --> 8643.90]  Oh well the whites of your eyes are bright
[8643.90 --> 8644.92]  And your hair is healthy
[8644.92 --> 8645.88]  And your fingernails
[8645.88 --> 8646.94]  Or whatever
[8646.94 --> 8648.92]  I can't say that I'm into it
[8648.92 --> 8650.30]  But you keep doing you sister
[8650.30 --> 8652.02]  Like it doesn't matter
[8652.02 --> 8653.22]  Very accepting
[8653.22 --> 8655.50]  The return of dumb phones?
[8657.10 --> 8657.90]  Yeah sure
[8657.90 --> 8658.52]  What is this article?
[8658.64 --> 8659.24]  Did you pick this one?
[8659.50 --> 8659.76]  Yeah
[8659.76 --> 8661.22]  Interest in dumb phones
[8661.22 --> 8662.48]  Has increased in recent years
[8662.48 --> 8663.96]  With many people being concerned
[8663.96 --> 8665.00]  About the addictive nature
[8665.00 --> 8665.78]  Of social media
[8665.78 --> 8667.92]  And constant online connectivity
[8667.92 --> 8669.28]  Dumb Wireless
[8669.28 --> 8670.24]  Great name
[8670.24 --> 8671.50]  An e-commerce site
[8671.50 --> 8672.82]  Specializing in dumb phones
[8672.82 --> 8673.82]  And smartphone restriction
[8673.82 --> 8675.30]  Launched in 2022
[8675.30 --> 8677.10]  In March of 2023
[8677.10 --> 8678.40]  The site sold about
[8678.40 --> 8680.68]  $7,000 worth of products
[8680.68 --> 8681.76]  Last month
[8681.76 --> 8682.62]  It sold
[8682.62 --> 8683.26]  Okay
[8683.26 --> 8683.86]  Alright
[8683.86 --> 8685.18]  Didn't see that twist coming
[8685.18 --> 8686.32]  So March 2023
[8686.32 --> 8687.90]  They sold $7,000 worth of products
[8687.90 --> 8688.66]  Last month
[8688.66 --> 8691.26]  It sold over $70,000 worth of products
[8691.26 --> 8692.90]  Startup Lite
[8692.90 --> 8695.10]  Released the LitePhone 2
[8695.10 --> 8695.90]  In 2019
[8695.90 --> 8697.32]  A smart-ish phone
[8697.32 --> 8698.90]  With a monochrome touchscreen
[8698.90 --> 8699.96]  And a limited library
[8699.96 --> 8700.90]  Of custom apps
[8700.90 --> 8702.36]  Lite's revenue doubled
[8702.36 --> 8704.04]  From 2022 to 2023
[8704.04 --> 8705.08]  And is on track
[8705.08 --> 8705.96]  To double again
[8705.96 --> 8706.74]  This year
[8706.74 --> 8708.88]  According to the New Yorker
[8708.88 --> 8709.80]  The startup's founders
[8709.80 --> 8711.08]  Say some of the most
[8711.08 --> 8712.70]  Willing LitePhone converts
[8712.70 --> 8714.06]  Are Gen Zers
[8714.06 --> 8715.40]  There are several
[8715.40 --> 8716.58]  Dumb solutions
[8716.58 --> 8717.40]  In addition to
[8717.40 --> 8718.54]  Fully dumb phones
[8718.54 --> 8719.50]  There are also phones
[8719.50 --> 8720.70]  Like the LitePhone 2
[8720.70 --> 8722.46]  Which has apps for directions
[8722.46 --> 8723.40]  As well as music
[8723.40 --> 8724.68]  And podcast libraries
[8724.68 --> 8726.26]  Some people only use
[8726.26 --> 8727.62]  Dumb phones when they go out
[8727.62 --> 8728.88]  Switching to a smartphone
[8728.88 --> 8729.70]  When they get home
[8729.70 --> 8730.28]  Interesting
[8730.28 --> 8732.14]  There are also companies
[8732.14 --> 8733.94]  Like Brick and Unplug
[8733.94 --> 8735.02]  They restrict the UI
[8735.02 --> 8736.44]  And apps on your phone
[8736.44 --> 8738.04]  Only allowing you
[8738.04 --> 8739.52]  To access blocked apps
[8739.52 --> 8741.38]  When you tap an NFC key
[8741.38 --> 8742.98]  That you can take with you
[8742.98 --> 8743.86]  Leave it home
[8743.86 --> 8745.04]  Or with a trusted person
[8745.04 --> 8746.24]  Or ditch completely
[8746.24 --> 8747.80]  Interesting
[8747.80 --> 8750.26]  I just don't think
[8750.26 --> 8750.94]  I could handle it
[8750.94 --> 8753.10]  I kind of want to try it
[8753.10 --> 8753.80]  I kind of want to do
[8753.80 --> 8754.66]  Like a one month thing
[8754.66 --> 8755.74]  But every time I bring it up
[8755.74 --> 8757.02]  People internally are like
[8757.02 --> 8757.22]  No
[8757.22 --> 8759.92]  We actually need to be able
[8759.92 --> 8760.64]  To reach you
[8760.64 --> 8761.04]  And I'm like
[8761.04 --> 8761.48]  Okay
[8761.48 --> 8763.96]  Honestly though
[8763.96 --> 8765.14]  Like if it wasn't for work
[8765.14 --> 8766.00]  I could probably be
[8766.00 --> 8766.72]  A dumb phone user
[8766.72 --> 8768.02]  Yeah
[8768.02 --> 8769.16]  Like I never go anywhere
[8769.16 --> 8769.40]  Anyway
[8769.40 --> 8770.22]  I just sit at my desktop
[8770.22 --> 8770.94]  I wonder if one of these
[8770.94 --> 8771.32]  Like
[8771.32 --> 8772.42]  I wonder if one of these
[8772.42 --> 8772.88]  What am I going to do
[8772.88 --> 8773.76]  Go see my friends
[8773.76 --> 8774.64]  Maybe
[8774.64 --> 8777.58]  Sorry
[8777.58 --> 8778.28]  I wonder if one of these
[8778.28 --> 8779.16]  Light phones would be able
[8779.16 --> 8780.88]  To support work communications
[8780.88 --> 8781.74]  Like Slack and Teams
[8781.74 --> 8782.12]  And whatnot
[8782.12 --> 8783.22]  I could see that
[8783.22 --> 8783.94]  But I mean
[8783.94 --> 8784.64]  It's funny
[8784.64 --> 8787.92]  How
[8787.92 --> 8790.06]  Aware I am
[8790.06 --> 8790.78]  Of how many people
[8790.78 --> 8791.36]  Use Teams
[8791.36 --> 8792.42]  For their social life
[8792.42 --> 8796.04]  It's
[8796.04 --> 8797.54]  Definitely a thing
[8797.54 --> 8799.58]  Yeah
[8799.58 --> 8799.92]  So
[8799.92 --> 8800.30]  Yeah
[8800.30 --> 8800.70]  I don't know
[8800.70 --> 8801.58]  I don't know if it would help
[8801.58 --> 8802.34]  That much
[8802.34 --> 8802.62]  Fair enough
[8802.62 --> 8803.00]  Yeah
[8803.00 --> 8803.96]  You shouldn't do that
[8803.96 --> 8804.38]  By the way
[8804.38 --> 8805.02]  Yeah
[8805.02 --> 8805.96]  It's like actually
[8805.96 --> 8806.68]  A bad idea
[8806.68 --> 8808.76]  Like you really shouldn't
[8808.76 --> 8809.40]  For real
[8809.40 --> 8813.08]  When you depart
[8813.08 --> 8813.84]  Said company
[8813.84 --> 8814.28]  Yeah
[8814.28 --> 8816.04]  That company can retain
[8816.04 --> 8816.82]  All of the messages
[8816.82 --> 8817.34]  Yes
[8817.34 --> 8818.70]  And you
[8818.70 --> 8820.80]  Can't retain all the messages
[8820.80 --> 8822.10]  Unless I guess you like
[8822.10 --> 8822.78]  Copy paste them
[8822.78 --> 8823.80]  Maybe there's a
[8823.80 --> 8824.70]  Data dump feature
[8824.70 --> 8825.22]  For users
[8825.22 --> 8825.70]  I don't know
[8825.70 --> 8826.04]  I have no idea
[8826.04 --> 8826.48]  But like
[8826.48 --> 8827.54]  You won't have
[8827.54 --> 8829.00]  That user account anymore
[8829.00 --> 8830.20]  So you should use
[8830.20 --> 8831.00]  Other ones
[8831.00 --> 8831.74]  And even if you could
[8831.74 --> 8832.30]  Dump that data
[8832.30 --> 8832.74]  You should be
[8832.74 --> 8834.04]  Extremely careful with it
[8834.04 --> 8835.42]  Because it might be
[8835.42 --> 8836.06]  Covered by your
[8836.06 --> 8837.08]  Organization's NDA
[8837.08 --> 8837.82]  For example
[8837.82 --> 8838.90]  And it might not
[8838.90 --> 8839.84]  Even be things you said
[8839.84 --> 8840.70]  It might be something
[8840.70 --> 8841.78]  That someone said to you
[8841.78 --> 8842.70]  But by the time
[8842.70 --> 8845.02]  You extract that data
[8845.02 --> 8846.20]  From their service
[8846.20 --> 8847.38]  That they pay for
[8847.38 --> 8849.10]  And it leaks
[8849.10 --> 8850.50]  Well the responsibility
[8850.50 --> 8851.28]  Wasn't your friend
[8851.28 --> 8852.24]  Because they sent
[8852.24 --> 8853.50]  An internal communication
[8853.50 --> 8854.60]  To an internal person
[8854.60 --> 8855.48]  That wasn't them
[8855.48 --> 8856.16]  That's on you
[8856.16 --> 8857.34]  So someone in chat
[8857.34 --> 8858.22]  Saying there's teams
[8858.22 --> 8859.82]  For personal use
[8859.82 --> 8861.26]  He's talking about
[8861.26 --> 8862.08]  Using work accounts
[8862.08 --> 8862.32]  Yes
[8862.32 --> 8863.74]  He's specifically
[8863.74 --> 8864.20]  Talking about
[8864.20 --> 8864.84]  Using work accounts
[8864.84 --> 8865.88]  Don't use work stuff
[8865.88 --> 8866.62]  For personal stuff
[8866.62 --> 8867.06]  Just
[8867.06 --> 8869.54]  Don't do it
[8869.54 --> 8872.20]  Floatplane chat
[8872.20 --> 8873.12]  Is talking about
[8873.12 --> 8874.14]  Killedbygoogle.com
[8874.14 --> 8876.08]  We are only
[8876.08 --> 8877.30]  A quarter of the way
[8877.30 --> 8878.00]  Into 2024
[8878.00 --> 8879.02]  And boy
[8879.02 --> 8879.68]  Do they ever have
[8879.68 --> 8880.40]  Some doozies
[8880.40 --> 8882.10]  Google domains
[8882.10 --> 8882.50]  Was
[8882.50 --> 8882.98]  Oh actually
[8882.98 --> 8883.38]  Technically
[8883.38 --> 8884.08]  That was the end
[8884.08 --> 8884.76]  Of last year
[8884.76 --> 8885.72]  I don't know
[8885.72 --> 8886.46]  What the keen is
[8886.46 --> 8887.06]  I don't care
[8887.06 --> 8888.12]  But google podcast
[8888.12 --> 8888.72]  Was killed
[8888.72 --> 8889.70]  11 days ago
[8889.70 --> 8890.58]  Is done
[8890.58 --> 8892.12]  Dropcam
[8892.12 --> 8892.94]  Remember dropcam
[8892.94 --> 8893.50]  Yeah
[8893.50 --> 8894.56]  That became nestcam
[8894.56 --> 8895.00]  Boom
[8895.00 --> 8895.50]  Done
[8895.50 --> 8896.12]  Dead
[8896.12 --> 8897.42]  Killed five days ago
[8897.42 --> 8899.14]  Jamboard we already knew about
[8899.14 --> 8900.20]  Google Jamboard is just
[8900.20 --> 8901.36]  Other more different jamboard
[8901.36 --> 8902.26]  Because google is
[8902.26 --> 8903.36]  VPN by google1
[8903.36 --> 8903.78]  Is dying
[8903.78 --> 8905.56]  VPN by google1
[8905.56 --> 8906.50]  Kicking the bucket
[8906.50 --> 8908.06]  In nine months
[8908.06 --> 8909.06]  It will be about
[8909.06 --> 8910.28]  Four years old
[8910.28 --> 8912.82]  Dang
[8912.82 --> 8914.62]  Apparently pixelvpn remains
[8914.62 --> 8915.66]  What's the difference
[8915.66 --> 8916.98]  I don't know
[8916.98 --> 8918.76]  I mean
[8918.76 --> 8919.56]  I'm often
[8919.56 --> 8920.36]  Confused
[8920.36 --> 8921.36]  By
[8921.36 --> 8923.04]  Differences
[8923.04 --> 8923.62]  In
[8923.62 --> 8924.58]  Backend
[8924.58 --> 8925.44]  For services
[8925.44 --> 8926.48]  That appear to be
[8926.48 --> 8927.94]  Exactly the same thing
[8927.94 --> 8928.60]  Like
[8928.60 --> 8929.16]  I
[8929.16 --> 8930.68]  There was something
[8930.68 --> 8931.92]  With the mobile app
[8931.92 --> 8934.20]  For youtube studio
[8934.20 --> 8935.26]  And I was like
[8935.26 --> 8935.90]  Well
[8935.90 --> 8936.98]  Like you have
[8936.98 --> 8937.70]  The data
[8937.70 --> 8939.10]  It's in the desktop app
[8939.10 --> 8939.52]  And they're like
[8939.52 --> 8940.00]  Yeah but it has
[8940.00 --> 8940.74]  A different backend
[8940.74 --> 8941.30]  And I'm like
[8941.30 --> 8943.24]  F***ing why
[8943.24 --> 8948.60]  I don't always know
[8948.60 --> 8950.14]  No but actually why
[8950.14 --> 8951.02]  I don't always know
[8951.02 --> 8953.36]  I am uninformed
[8953.36 --> 8954.68]  Need
[8954.68 --> 8955.70]  View count
[8955.70 --> 8956.72]  Database
[8956.72 --> 8957.36]  Lookup
[8957.36 --> 8958.26]  Location
[8958.26 --> 8958.80]  XY
[8958.80 --> 8959.52]  Return
[8959.52 --> 8960.74]  There's definitely reasons
[8960.74 --> 8961.68]  For apps
[8961.68 --> 8962.64]  If they're even
[8962.64 --> 8963.34]  Pretty similar
[8963.34 --> 8964.56]  Like I kind of understand
[8964.56 --> 8965.08]  Why the
[8965.08 --> 8966.12]  Teams work
[8966.12 --> 8967.20]  And Teams personal accounts
[8967.20 --> 8967.62]  Are different
[8967.62 --> 8968.48]  I wish they weren't
[8968.48 --> 8969.44]  Both called teams
[8969.44 --> 8970.72]  Because it's really annoying
[8970.72 --> 8971.52]  When I'm trying to launch
[8971.52 --> 8971.96]  One of them
[8971.96 --> 8972.34]  And I search teams
[8972.34 --> 8973.40]  Personal one MSN Messenger
[8973.40 --> 8973.98]  Let's go
[8973.98 --> 8974.70]  Yes please
[8974.70 --> 8975.64]  Like come on
[8975.64 --> 8976.90]  Or something else
[8976.90 --> 8977.58]  Whatever it is
[8977.58 --> 8978.16]  Just don't have
[8978.16 --> 8978.88]  Multiple names
[8978.88 --> 8979.82]  For effectively the same thing
[8979.82 --> 8980.30]  Anyways
[8980.30 --> 8982.16]  I get that
[8982.16 --> 8982.72]  But
[8982.72 --> 8984.14]  In some of these cases
[8984.14 --> 8984.84]  Yeah I have no idea
[8984.84 --> 8987.08]  No idea
[8987.08 --> 8989.36]  Anyways
[8989.36 --> 8989.98]  Moving on
[8989.98 --> 8991.30]  Should we do the Udeo thing
[8991.30 --> 8992.40]  Yeah let's do it
[8992.40 --> 8993.88]  Sora for music
[8993.88 --> 8995.86]  Former Google DeepMind engineers
[8995.86 --> 8996.64]  David Ding
[8996.64 --> 8997.78]  And Andrew Sanchez
[8997.78 --> 8999.16]  Have launched Udeo
[8999.16 --> 9000.48]  A platform for creating
[9000.48 --> 9001.96]  AI generated music
[9001.96 --> 9003.48]  It already features
[9003.48 --> 9004.52]  Tremendous tracks
[9004.52 --> 9004.98]  Like
[9004.98 --> 9006.22]  Wow
[9006.22 --> 9007.52]  I didn't know that
[9007.52 --> 9009.32]  Is that the name of it
[9009.32 --> 9011.14]  That's the name of the track
[9011.14 --> 9012.20]  Apparently
[9012.20 --> 9013.24]  I thought it would be
[9013.24 --> 9014.04]  In quotes maybe
[9014.04 --> 9014.28]  But
[9014.28 --> 9015.24]  Do you want to
[9015.24 --> 9016.26]  Do you want to listen to it together
[9016.26 --> 9017.38]  Should we finish the
[9017.38 --> 9018.12]  Stuff
[9018.12 --> 9019.50]  And then listen to it
[9019.50 --> 9019.62]  Or no
[9019.62 --> 9020.40]  No let's listen to it
[9020.40 --> 9021.08]  Together first
[9021.08 --> 9021.50]  Got it
[9021.50 --> 9021.88]  Okay
[9021.88 --> 9022.62]  Are we
[9022.62 --> 9023.66]  We're not playing it over stream
[9023.66 --> 9024.20]  We're just
[9024.20 --> 9024.84]  Yeah yeah
[9024.84 --> 9025.76]  We can play it over stream
[9025.76 --> 9026.82]  That is apparently
[9026.82 --> 9028.80]  The name of the track
[9028.80 --> 9029.22]  It's wow
[9029.22 --> 9029.80]  I didn't know that
[9029.80 --> 9030.08]  Oh yeah
[9030.08 --> 9031.96]  It has 70,000 playbacks
[9031.96 --> 9032.34]  Apparently
[9032.34 --> 9033.08]  Hold on
[9033.08 --> 9033.80]  This wasn't the one
[9033.80 --> 9035.24]  That I wanted to
[9035.24 --> 9040.64]  Hold on
[9040.64 --> 9041.16]  Let me see
[9041.16 --> 9042.60]  Let me open up my
[9042.60 --> 9043.68]  Teams for work
[9043.68 --> 9046.52]  This wasn't the
[9046.52 --> 9047.60]  This wasn't the song
[9047.60 --> 9049.88]  That I had wanted
[9049.88 --> 9050.84]  To listen to
[9050.84 --> 9052.42]  Okay yeah
[9052.42 --> 9053.06]  This is great
[9053.06 --> 9054.12]  How do I get this link
[9054.12 --> 9054.74]  To myself
[9054.74 --> 9055.44]  Hold on
[9055.44 --> 9056.12]  What's the name of it
[9056.12 --> 9056.86]  When you just search it
[9056.86 --> 9058.12]  That's a Twitter link
[9058.12 --> 9060.64]  Okay
[9060.64 --> 9061.48]  So I need to send it
[9061.48 --> 9062.38]  To LTT win
[9062.38 --> 9063.20]  Dan
[9063.20 --> 9064.12]  Are we able to listen
[9064.12 --> 9064.78]  To this together
[9064.78 --> 9065.32]  With the stream
[9065.32 --> 9066.16]  Yep
[9066.16 --> 9068.52]  That shouldn't be a problem
[9068.52 --> 9069.12]  Okay
[9069.12 --> 9070.86]  Maybe not on your phone
[9070.86 --> 9071.20]  But
[9071.20 --> 9071.80]  No no no no
[9071.80 --> 9072.86]  I'm sending it to myself
[9072.86 --> 9073.98]  Okay so first
[9073.98 --> 9074.56]  Let's listen to
[9074.56 --> 9075.32]  Wow I didn't know that
[9075.32 --> 9075.62]  Together
[9075.62 --> 9076.62]  Is this gonna work
[9076.62 --> 9078.20]  Oh well
[9078.20 --> 9078.96]  It helps to not
[9078.96 --> 9079.86]  Have my audio muted
[9079.86 --> 9081.74]  Here we go
[9081.74 --> 9083.38]  Oh also it helps
[9083.38 --> 9083.96]  To be connected
[9083.96 --> 9084.58]  To the right thing
[9084.58 --> 9085.12]  Okay Dan
[9085.12 --> 9085.86]  You got sound from me
[9085.86 --> 9087.42]  Yeah I saw a dingle
[9087.42 --> 9087.94]  Bing bing bing
[9087.94 --> 9088.94]  Okay here we go
[9088.94 --> 9089.70]  Let's see
[9089.70 --> 9100.42]  Oh boy
[9100.42 --> 9116.88]  We're in so much trouble
[9116.88 --> 9145.26]  Scroll down a bit
[9145.26 --> 9146.10]  I wanna see the lyrics
[9146.10 --> 9148.38]  It's on my screen
[9148.38 --> 9150.18]  Oh you got it
[9150.18 --> 9153.38]  Oh my gosh
[9153.38 --> 9155.44]  So
[9155.44 --> 9158.30]  That's a thing that exists
[9158.30 --> 9159.58]  Yeah we're totally screwed
[9159.58 --> 9160.56]  Hold on
[9160.56 --> 9161.46]  That was not actually
[9161.46 --> 9162.68]  The one that I wanted you
[9162.68 --> 9163.14]  To hear
[9163.14 --> 9163.86]  That
[9163.86 --> 9166.20]  Blew my mind
[9166.20 --> 9167.96]  This was tweeted by
[9167.96 --> 9169.14]  ABC Dent
[9169.14 --> 9170.18]  Minded
[9170.18 --> 9173.60]  They said
[9173.60 --> 9174.44]  I found an account
[9174.44 --> 9175.08]  On Udeo
[9175.08 --> 9175.78]  That is mostly
[9175.78 --> 9176.56]  Generating songs
[9176.56 --> 9177.42]  About how his friend
[9177.42 --> 9177.92]  Seth
[9177.92 --> 9178.88]  Shit his pants
[9178.88 --> 9179.60]  Don't work
[9179.60 --> 9182.62]  Oh my gosh
[9182.62 --> 9182.90]  Okay
[9182.90 --> 9183.50]  You guys ready
[9183.50 --> 9183.98]  For this one
[9183.98 --> 9185.44]  Yeah I got it muted
[9185.44 --> 9186.04]  For now
[9186.04 --> 9187.60]  Alright I gotcha
[9187.60 --> 9188.04]  Here we go
[9188.04 --> 9189.42]  I got me a man
[9189.42 --> 9190.36]  But there's
[9190.36 --> 9192.60]  Just one problem
[9192.60 --> 9196.28]  Well he works
[9196.28 --> 9197.18]  Nine to five
[9197.18 --> 9199.06]  And he's a hell of a guy
[9199.06 --> 9200.10]  But he's shitting
[9200.10 --> 9201.90]  His pants at work
[9201.90 --> 9204.00]  Oh Seth
[9204.00 --> 9205.90]  Why'd you have to go
[9205.90 --> 9207.92]  Shit his pants
[9207.92 --> 9209.86]  Can't believe you were
[9209.86 --> 9212.20]  Gonna take me to the dance
[9212.20 --> 9214.44]  With all that nasty poop
[9214.44 --> 9215.40]  In your pants
[9215.40 --> 9221.36]  I got me a man
[9221.36 --> 9222.10]  Um
[9222.10 --> 9224.60]  So yeah
[9224.60 --> 9225.42]  Oh wow
[9225.42 --> 9226.36]  Get rekt Seth
[9226.36 --> 9227.00]  Not gonna lie
[9227.00 --> 9228.16]  I hadn't heard that
[9228.16 --> 9229.14]  Country song one
[9229.14 --> 9232.46]  I would unironically
[9232.46 --> 9233.26]  Listen to that
[9233.26 --> 9234.94]  So
[9234.94 --> 9235.98]  About some dude
[9235.98 --> 9237.10]  Talking about how
[9237.10 --> 9238.56]  Uh
[9238.56 --> 9239.40]  Insurance fraud
[9239.40 --> 9240.08]  Is a federal crime
[9240.08 --> 9241.32]  And nobody told him
[9241.32 --> 9242.10]  It kind of reminds me
[9242.10 --> 9242.54]  Of the song
[9242.54 --> 9244.04]  Online by Brad Paisley
[9244.04 --> 9244.94]  Which is like
[9244.94 --> 9247.54]  One of my favorite
[9247.54 --> 9248.78]  Like parody songs
[9248.78 --> 9249.70]  Yeah like I
[9249.70 --> 9250.56]  Mentioned like
[9250.56 --> 9251.22]  We're in trouble
[9251.22 --> 9252.30]  And someone in chat
[9252.30 --> 9252.66]  Was like
[9252.66 --> 9253.64]  Yeah I don't think yet
[9253.64 --> 9254.46]  People would listen
[9254.46 --> 9254.96]  To this stuff
[9254.96 --> 9256.00]  That
[9256.00 --> 9257.06]  That country song
[9257.06 --> 9257.92]  About
[9257.92 --> 9260.24]  Well I didn't know that
[9260.24 --> 9261.40]  People will absolutely
[9261.40 --> 9261.70]  Listen to that
[9261.70 --> 9262.58]  It was well produced
[9262.58 --> 9263.12]  As well
[9263.12 --> 9263.54]  Yeah
[9263.54 --> 9264.90]  That messed me up
[9264.90 --> 9266.96]  Actually Ninja Man
[9266.96 --> 9268.14]  Asked that just now
[9268.14 --> 9269.04]  And you were way ahead of him
[9269.04 --> 9270.18]  What does Dan think about these
[9270.18 --> 9270.90]  Since he has experience
[9270.90 --> 9271.44]  In production
[9271.44 --> 9272.36]  Sometimes you can hear
[9272.36 --> 9273.04]  Vocal issues
[9273.04 --> 9273.90]  But is there things
[9273.90 --> 9275.08]  That the layman
[9275.08 --> 9276.20]  Might not notice here
[9276.20 --> 9277.46]  Like it's pretty obvious
[9277.46 --> 9278.40]  To me that
[9278.40 --> 9280.24]  They're hiding behind
[9280.24 --> 9281.56]  Like with these genres
[9281.56 --> 9282.98]  And with the styles
[9282.98 --> 9283.78]  Of both of these
[9283.78 --> 9284.70]  They're hiding behind
[9284.70 --> 9285.58]  Kind of a
[9285.58 --> 9287.86]  Kind of a
[9287.86 --> 9288.82]  A more analog
[9288.82 --> 9289.42]  Sound
[9289.42 --> 9290.70]  A little bit
[9290.70 --> 9291.20]  Like I think
[9291.20 --> 9291.70]  They might be
[9291.70 --> 9292.74]  Masking some
[9292.74 --> 9293.60]  Lack of clarity
[9293.60 --> 9294.14]  That way
[9294.14 --> 9296.08]  I've heard better
[9296.08 --> 9296.46]  Voices
[9296.46 --> 9297.56]  On the country
[9297.56 --> 9297.80]  One
[9297.80 --> 9298.76]  But the
[9298.76 --> 9299.60]  Like the
[9299.60 --> 9300.12]  50s
[9300.12 --> 9300.98]  Swing bop
[9300.98 --> 9302.28]  Seth pooping
[9302.28 --> 9302.56]  One
[9302.56 --> 9303.94]  Her voice
[9303.94 --> 9304.60]  Was very clean
[9304.60 --> 9306.26]  I've also
[9306.26 --> 9307.28]  Heard a lot of
[9307.28 --> 9308.08]  People that
[9308.08 --> 9308.54]  Take
[9308.54 --> 9309.84]  Normal talking
[9309.84 --> 9310.52]  And will turn them
[9310.52 --> 9311.46]  Into singing voices
[9311.46 --> 9312.18]  Or make
[9312.18 --> 9313.16]  Singing voices
[9313.16 --> 9314.18]  Out of characters
[9314.18 --> 9314.82]  And
[9314.82 --> 9316.52]  Those are kind of
[9316.52 --> 9317.70]  Similar to the
[9317.70 --> 9318.66]  The timbre of the
[9318.66 --> 9318.92]  Like
[9318.92 --> 9320.90]  The country guy
[9320.90 --> 9321.86]  But the
[9321.86 --> 9322.76]  The backing music
[9322.76 --> 9324.22]  Was far too good
[9324.22 --> 9324.90]  And that was
[9324.90 --> 9326.20]  Very concerning
[9326.20 --> 9327.16]  Mind-blowing
[9327.16 --> 9328.08]  Absolutely
[9328.08 --> 9328.88]  Incredible
[9328.88 --> 9330.36]  I wish I could see
[9330.36 --> 9331.00]  The prompt
[9331.00 --> 9332.06]  Like how did
[9332.06 --> 9332.96]  How did you get it
[9332.96 --> 9335.54]  How did you get it
[9335.54 --> 9336.24]  To write this
[9336.24 --> 9338.38]  Maybe you feed it
[9338.38 --> 9338.84]  The lyrics
[9338.84 --> 9339.44]  I don't know
[9339.44 --> 9341.20]  Maybe
[9341.20 --> 9342.58]  I mean obviously
[9342.58 --> 9343.28]  The Seth one
[9343.28 --> 9343.72]  Probably
[9343.72 --> 9346.70]  No because you
[9346.70 --> 9347.30]  Could just tell it
[9347.30 --> 9347.94]  Like the person's
[9347.94 --> 9348.48]  Name is Seth
[9348.48 --> 9349.12]  Like it might do
[9349.12 --> 9349.50]  The writing
[9349.50 --> 9350.22]  So anyway
[9350.22 --> 9351.72]  UDL will generate
[9351.72 --> 9353.14]  Two 32 second songs
[9353.14 --> 9353.94]  From a written prompt
[9353.94 --> 9354.96]  Giving users a choice
[9354.96 --> 9355.74]  Over which they
[9355.74 --> 9356.56]  Would like to use
[9356.56 --> 9357.32]  The song can then
[9357.32 --> 9358.04]  Be extended
[9358.04 --> 9359.40]  By adding sections
[9359.40 --> 9360.30]  Before or after
[9360.30 --> 9361.02]  The original clip
[9361.02 --> 9361.48]  With up to
[9361.48 --> 9362.78]  10 sections total
[9362.78 --> 9363.92]  The extensions
[9363.92 --> 9364.58]  Can be made
[9364.58 --> 9365.04]  With the same
[9365.04 --> 9365.40]  Prompt
[9365.40 --> 9366.24]  Or a completely
[9366.24 --> 9367.02]  Different one
[9367.02 --> 9368.12]  The platform
[9368.12 --> 9369.92]  Plans updates
[9369.92 --> 9370.54]  With more
[9370.54 --> 9371.54]  Musician focused
[9371.54 --> 9372.04]  Tools
[9372.04 --> 9373.00]  Like being able
[9373.00 --> 9373.46]  To add

[9377.50 --> 9378.70]  Creation options
[9378.70 --> 9379.70]  This comes just
[9379.70 --> 9380.62]  A couple of weeks
[9380.62 --> 9381.80]  After 200 plus
[9381.80 --> 9382.48]  Music artists
[9382.48 --> 9383.76]  Signed an open
[9383.76 --> 9384.06]  Letter
[9384.06 --> 9385.32]  In an attempt
[9385.32 --> 9385.82]  To prevent
[9385.82 --> 9386.36]  The creation
[9386.36 --> 9387.24]  Of exactly
[9387.24 --> 9387.82]  The type of

[9388.26 --> 9389.02]  UDO is
[9389.02 --> 9390.50]  Having said that
[9390.50 --> 9391.58]  UDO's founders
[9391.58 --> 9392.56]  Claim they have
[9392.56 --> 9393.62]  Strong copyright
[9393.62 --> 9394.38]  Protection measures
[9394.38 --> 9394.80]  In place
[9394.80 --> 9395.54]  So you can't
[9395.54 --> 9396.14]  Reference any
[9396.14 --> 9396.92]  Specific artist
[9396.92 --> 9398.12]  And any track
[9398.12 --> 9399.26]  That sounds like

[9411.80 --> 9413.20]  Here's a ready
[9413.20 --> 9413.74]  Well
[9413.74 --> 9414.72]  Maybe not
[9414.72 --> 9415.44]  My soul
[9415.44 --> 9422.20]  It's too good
[9422.20 --> 9423.28]  Oh no
[9423.28 --> 9424.74]  It's not about
[9424.74 --> 9425.70]  Processors
[9425.70 --> 9426.62]  Or graphics
[9426.62 --> 9427.78]  Cards in play
[9427.78 --> 9428.94]  It's about
[9428.94 --> 9430.40]  A strange concoction
[9430.40 --> 9432.00]  We'll sit today
[9432.00 --> 9433.88]  Mixing
[9433.88 --> 9434.62]  Pepsi
[9434.62 --> 9435.50]  And milk

[9441.56 --> 9442.80]  In the world
[9442.80 --> 9443.60]  Of tech
[9443.60 --> 9444.58]  Where it's
[9444.58 --> 9445.32]  Modulate
[9445.32 --> 9451.86]  Back to the one
[9451.86 --> 9459.60]  Oh it's got the formula down
[9459.60 --> 9460.82]  Like perfect
[9460.82 --> 9463.08]  No
[9463.08 --> 9465.12]  Oh man
[9465.12 --> 9474.60]  This one has some
[9474.60 --> 9476.12]  Some hints of AI-ness
[9476.12 --> 9476.84]  Oh yeah
[9476.84 --> 9477.42]  Yeah
[9477.42 --> 9478.84]  There's groups that
[9478.84 --> 9479.86]  Actually do that
[9479.86 --> 9480.88]  That's true
[9480.88 --> 9482.50]  They have the formula down
[9482.50 --> 9483.22]  They have the
[9483.22 --> 9484.92]  Like structure down
[9484.92 --> 9485.82]  They have the
[9485.82 --> 9487.26]  Strange modulation down
[9487.26 --> 9488.00]  It might actually be
[9488.00 --> 9488.42]  More
[9488.42 --> 9490.14]  It might be more
[9490.14 --> 9492.06]  Interesting to listen to
[9492.06 --> 9493.16]  Than modern pop music
[9493.16 --> 9493.96]  Because it will do
[9493.96 --> 9494.72]  Weird things
[9494.72 --> 9495.88]  That you're not expecting
[9495.88 --> 9497.44]  Using the pop formula
[9497.44 --> 9498.64]  So these might actually
[9498.64 --> 9499.58]  Be more
[9499.58 --> 9501.48]  Dopamine inducing
[9501.48 --> 9502.62]  Cheesecake brain
[9502.62 --> 9503.68]  Than actual
[9503.68 --> 9504.36]  Pop music
[9504.36 --> 9505.94]  Ah
[9505.94 --> 9507.26]  Well that's depressing
[9507.26 --> 9507.98]  Thanks Dan
[9507.98 --> 9508.36]  Cheesecake brain
[9508.36 --> 9509.20]  Cheesecake brain
[9509.20 --> 9509.58]  I use
[9509.58 --> 9510.64]  Oh yeah
[9510.64 --> 9511.70]  That might be my term
[9511.70 --> 9514.32]  Okay never mind
[9514.32 --> 9516.30]  Pop music triggers
[9516.30 --> 9517.90]  Like the cheesecake reflex
[9517.90 --> 9518.84]  I call it
[9518.84 --> 9520.28]  Your brain loves
[9520.28 --> 9521.50]  Sugar and salt
[9521.50 --> 9521.88]  By the way
[9521.88 --> 9522.86]  I thought you might like this
[9522.86 --> 9523.14]  We
[9523.14 --> 9524.04]  Linus and I have been
[9524.04 --> 9524.74]  Playing this game
[9524.74 --> 9526.02]  Called tape to tape
[9526.02 --> 9526.88]  Which is very fun
[9526.88 --> 9528.22]  But the developer
[9528.22 --> 9528.90]  Behind it is called
[9528.90 --> 9529.88]  Excellent rectangle
[9529.88 --> 9530.42]  Nice
[9530.42 --> 9531.04]  Hell yeah
[9531.04 --> 9532.40]  I like their logo
[9532.40 --> 9533.08]  Yeah
[9533.08 --> 9534.20]  Video game studio
[9534.20 --> 9535.64]  That's all you need
[9535.64 --> 9536.36]  To know about them
[9536.36 --> 9539.00]  That's great
[9539.00 --> 9539.40]  What
[9539.40 --> 9540.26]  Oh never mind
[9540.26 --> 9540.50]  Okay
[9540.50 --> 9541.12]  What's up
[9541.12 --> 9541.78]  I saw people
[9541.78 --> 9542.04]  I saw people also
[9542.04 --> 9543.48]  Search for it
[9543.48 --> 9543.72]  And I saw
[9543.72 --> 9544.36]  Slapshot rebound
[9544.36 --> 9545.16]  And I thought it was like
[9545.16 --> 9546.02]  They also made
[9546.02 --> 9546.44]  And I was like
[9546.44 --> 9547.26]  No way
[9547.26 --> 9547.98]  Slapshot rebound
[9547.98 --> 9548.48]  Sick too
[9548.48 --> 9548.80]  Yeah
[9548.80 --> 9550.00]  But tape to tape
[9550.00 --> 9550.48]  We've been having
[9550.48 --> 9551.36]  A lot of fun with
[9551.36 --> 9552.18]  It's a roguelite
[9552.18 --> 9553.26]  You go through a campaign
[9553.26 --> 9554.32]  You play against teams
[9554.32 --> 9555.46]  That have various
[9555.46 --> 9556.96]  Types of completely
[9556.96 --> 9558.04]  Unfair buffs
[9558.04 --> 9559.00]  There's basically
[9559.00 --> 9560.26]  No rules whatsoever
[9560.26 --> 9563.32]  Oh sick pass
[9563.32 --> 9566.80]  It's fun
[9566.80 --> 9567.24]  Yeah
[9567.24 --> 9569.14]  It's dumb fun
[9569.14 --> 9571.50]  Supports
[9571.50 --> 9573.14]  Multiplayer support
[9573.14 --> 9574.06]  Is a little complicated
[9574.06 --> 9575.68]  Because it only supports
[9575.68 --> 9576.72]  Local couch multiplayer
[9576.72 --> 9577.70]  So you can use
[9577.70 --> 9578.62]  Steam remote play
[9578.62 --> 9579.84]  But if you want to play
[9579.84 --> 9580.70]  With five people
[9580.70 --> 9581.72]  On a team
[9581.72 --> 9583.36]  Steam remote play
[9583.36 --> 9583.84]  Only supports
[9583.84 --> 9585.06]  Four controllers
[9585.06 --> 9586.72]  So we had to have
[9586.72 --> 9587.66]  One person
[9587.66 --> 9589.14]  Or we had to have
[9589.14 --> 9589.78]  Two people
[9589.78 --> 9590.54]  Side by side
[9590.54 --> 9591.20]  In the same place
[9591.20 --> 9591.66]  So that was me
[9591.66 --> 9592.52]  And Yvonne last night
[9592.52 --> 9593.12]  And then she was
[9593.12 --> 9593.66]  On the keyboard
[9593.66 --> 9594.66]  And I was on the controller
[9594.66 --> 9595.22]  And then we were able
[9595.22 --> 9595.76]  To have three more
[9595.76 --> 9596.58]  Controllers remote in
[9596.58 --> 9597.34]  That was the only way
[9597.34 --> 9597.72]  We could get
[9597.72 --> 9598.54]  Five players working
[9598.54 --> 9599.84]  So if anyone from
[9599.84 --> 9600.72]  Valve is watching
[9600.72 --> 9601.66]  Who works on
[9601.66 --> 9602.44]  Remote play
[9602.44 --> 9603.52]  Or anything like that
[9603.52 --> 9605.60]  Hey could we have
[9605.60 --> 9606.06]  A couple more
[9606.06 --> 9606.86]  Controllers supported
[9606.86 --> 9607.42]  In remote play
[9607.42 --> 9608.18]  That would be sick
[9608.18 --> 9608.92]  That would be great
[9608.92 --> 9609.72]  Obviously
[9609.72 --> 9611.94]  This is a niche use case
[9611.94 --> 9612.82]  But it's the kind of thing
[9612.82 --> 9613.80]  That every once in a while
[9613.80 --> 9614.64]  A Valve person
[9614.64 --> 9615.30]  Will just be like
[9615.30 --> 9616.22]  Hee hee hee
[9616.22 --> 9616.90]  That's a good idea
[9616.90 --> 9618.04]  Maybe I'll just make that
[9618.04 --> 9618.70]  Because I don't know
[9618.70 --> 9619.14]  If I even have
[9619.14 --> 9619.88]  A real boss anyway
[9619.88 --> 9622.18]  So if that situation
[9622.18 --> 9623.52]  Is going on right now
[9623.52 --> 9625.42]  We'd be super into that
[9625.42 --> 9628.80]  I've got one final thought
[9628.80 --> 9629.18]  On this
[9629.18 --> 9630.08]  If I can interject
[9630.08 --> 9633.52]  When is it going to be able
[9633.52 --> 9634.20]  To make like
[9634.20 --> 9635.50]  Death Grips songs
[9635.50 --> 9636.98]  You know
[9636.98 --> 9638.54]  That's the thing
[9638.54 --> 9639.34]  Is a lot of these
[9639.34 --> 9639.92]  Are trained on
[9639.92 --> 9640.66]  Massive amounts
[9640.66 --> 9643.28]  Of the most generic thing
[9643.28 --> 9644.06]  So like
[9644.06 --> 9645.02]  Pop music is dead
[9645.02 --> 9646.14]  Like this just kills
[9646.14 --> 9646.72]  Pop music
[9646.72 --> 9647.70]  Just like
[9647.70 --> 9648.24]  You know
[9648.24 --> 9649.52]  The AR art generators
[9649.52 --> 9650.12]  Are killing
[9650.12 --> 9651.74]  Single person
[9651.74 --> 9652.54]  Pin up art
[9652.54 --> 9654.08]  But
[9654.08 --> 9656.06]  If you're going to get weird
[9656.06 --> 9656.66]  Right
[9656.66 --> 9657.90]  Or like
[9657.90 --> 9658.36]  Or like
[9658.36 --> 9659.50]  Like backgrounds
[9659.50 --> 9660.08]  Do you know what I mean
[9660.08 --> 9660.72]  Did you just
[9660.72 --> 9661.52]  Hold on
[9661.52 --> 9662.04]  Hold on
[9662.04 --> 9662.52]  What
[9662.52 --> 9663.88]  Did you just describe
[9663.88 --> 9665.14]  Like
[9665.14 --> 9666.76]  Thirsty commissions
[9666.76 --> 9668.88]  As single person
[9668.88 --> 9669.82]  Pin up art
[9669.82 --> 9670.84]  Yeah
[9670.84 --> 9672.06]  Because that is the most
[9672.06 --> 9672.94]  Apt description
[9672.94 --> 9673.92]  I have ever heard
[9673.92 --> 9674.74]  For anything
[9674.74 --> 9675.34]  Ever
[9675.34 --> 9677.14]  Carry on
[9677.14 --> 9677.92]  Yeah
[9677.92 --> 9678.34]  You know
[9678.34 --> 9678.64]  Okay
[9678.64 --> 9679.16]  We've got a
[9679.16 --> 9680.48]  Beautiful painted background
[9680.48 --> 9680.92]  Right
[9680.92 --> 9682.02]  Nobody's going to do
[9682.02 --> 9682.44]  Those anymore
[9682.44 --> 9682.98]  But like
[9682.98 --> 9684.10]  Death Grips
[9684.10 --> 9685.86]  Or any of the other
[9685.86 --> 9687.00]  Really strange
[9687.00 --> 9688.16]  Kind of out there
[9688.16 --> 9689.44]  Types of
[9689.44 --> 9689.96]  So what you're saying
[9689.96 --> 9690.88]  Is humans have a niche
[9690.88 --> 9692.04]  It's just very weird
[9692.04 --> 9692.62]  Yeah
[9692.62 --> 9693.08]  Yeah
[9693.08 --> 9694.00]  Humans are going to make
[9694.00 --> 9694.82]  The weird stuff
[9694.82 --> 9696.48]  And then the
[9696.48 --> 9697.22]  Boring stuff
[9697.22 --> 9697.94]  Is Death Grips the band
[9697.94 --> 9699.62]  Where everyone gets pissed off
[9699.62 --> 9700.72]  If people don't record
[9700.72 --> 9701.40]  Their concerts
[9701.40 --> 9702.46]  Because they often have songs
[9702.46 --> 9703.58]  That they only play at like
[9703.58 --> 9704.98]  I have no idea
[9704.98 --> 9705.60]  I used to
[9705.60 --> 9706.94]  I used to despise them
[9706.94 --> 9707.90]  Because they were kind of
[9707.90 --> 9708.90]  Outside of that
[9708.90 --> 9710.34]  Understanding
[9710.34 --> 9712.02]  I don't find artists
[9712.02 --> 9712.42]  That I like
[9712.42 --> 9713.26]  I don't get this
[9713.26 --> 9714.00]  Very often
[9714.00 --> 9715.10]  And then Adam
[9715.10 --> 9716.42]  Made me listen to them
[9716.42 --> 9717.36]  A lot
[9717.36 --> 9717.80]  And
[9717.80 --> 9719.10]  And he said that
[9719.10 --> 9719.68]  They were good
[9719.68 --> 9721.10]  And so I had to
[9721.10 --> 9721.84]  Revisit it
[9721.84 --> 9722.48]  Now I get it
[9722.48 --> 9723.10]  I'm pretty sure
[9723.10 --> 9723.54]  I'm pretty sure
[9723.54 --> 9724.20]  That's Death Grips
[9724.20 --> 9724.64]  Probably
[9724.64 --> 9727.56]  Yeah
[9727.56 --> 9728.10]  I don't know
[9728.10 --> 9730.16]  I ended up on the subreddit
[9730.16 --> 9730.94]  Because we were
[9730.94 --> 9731.90]  Looking at that
[9731.90 --> 9733.10]  Generated song
[9733.10 --> 9733.52]  And apparently
[9733.52 --> 9734.64]  Mods at r slash
[9734.64 --> 9734.98]  The crew
[9734.98 --> 9735.68]  Are shutting down
[9735.68 --> 9736.42]  Any discussion
[9736.42 --> 9737.18]  Of Ubisoft
[9737.18 --> 9737.96]  Revoking players
[9737.96 --> 9738.64]  License keys
[9738.64 --> 9740.12]  So that's bad
[9740.12 --> 9742.14]  Do they have a
[9742.14 --> 9742.78]  Pinned post about it
[9742.78 --> 9743.20]  By any chance
[9743.20 --> 9745.56]  Over on r slash
[9745.56 --> 9745.88]  The crew
[9745.88 --> 9746.36]  Yeah
[9746.36 --> 9747.02]  Not sure
[9747.02 --> 9748.24]  That's a good question
[9748.24 --> 9748.80]  I want to go check
[9748.80 --> 9749.60]  Because sometimes
[9749.60 --> 9750.60]  Mods will do that
[9750.60 --> 9751.06]  Because
[9751.06 --> 9753.72]  Is it actually
[9753.72 --> 9754.92]  Just r slash
[9754.92 --> 9755.38]  The crew
[9755.38 --> 9755.94]  Because there's
[9755.94 --> 9756.52]  Nine members
[9756.52 --> 9760.96]  What is the
[9760.96 --> 9761.36]  What is the
[9761.36 --> 9761.88]  Actual subreddit
[9761.88 --> 9763.04]  r slash
[9763.04 --> 9763.46]  The crew
[9763.46 --> 9764.30]  I don't know
[9764.30 --> 9765.90]  Maybe it's not
[9765.90 --> 9767.74]  Hold on
[9767.74 --> 9768.42]  This has like
[9768.42 --> 9768.78]  One and a half
[9768.78 --> 9769.42]  Thousand up votes
[9769.42 --> 9769.78]  Though I don't
[9769.78 --> 9770.52]  Think they made it up
[9770.52 --> 9771.40]  No I don't think
[9771.40 --> 9771.70]  So either
[9771.70 --> 9772.18]  I'm just wondering
[9772.18 --> 9772.66]  What the actual
[9772.66 --> 9773.30]  Subreddit is
[9773.30 --> 9773.84]  I don't know
[9773.84 --> 9774.46]  I don't see a link
[9774.46 --> 9774.82]  To it
[9774.82 --> 9776.48]  They've also
[9776.48 --> 9777.08]  Locked the thread
[9777.08 --> 9777.60]  Explaining why
[9777.60 --> 9778.20]  They removed the
[9778.20 --> 9778.74]  First thread
[9778.74 --> 9780.06]  Because no one
[9780.06 --> 9780.72]  Was buying it
[9780.72 --> 9781.34]  Oh it's
[9781.34 --> 9782.22]  It's written
[9782.22 --> 9782.94]  Incorrectly
[9782.94 --> 9783.72]  It's the underscore
[9783.72 --> 9784.14]  Crew
[9784.14 --> 9784.68]  Oh yeah
[9784.68 --> 9785.08]  There you go
[9785.08 --> 9785.36]  There's your
[9785.36 --> 9785.58]  Problem
[9785.58 --> 9786.26]  Come on
[9786.26 --> 9786.60]  OP
[9786.60 --> 9791.08]  In other news
[9791.08 --> 9793.60]  Our short circuit
[9793.60 --> 9795.20]  For these
[9795.20 --> 9796.02]  Wireless routers
[9796.02 --> 9796.76]  Is finally live
[9796.76 --> 9800.92]  Yeah
[9800.92 --> 9801.76]  We do
[9801.76 --> 9802.66]  We do a little bit
[9802.66 --> 9803.34]  Of real world
[9803.34 --> 9804.22]  Testing with them
[9804.22 --> 9805.68]  Could a minion
[9805.68 --> 9806.68]  Router be any good
[9806.68 --> 9807.58]  No
[9807.58 --> 9808.92]  Luke
[9808.92 --> 9810.58]  Why are you
[9810.58 --> 9811.28]  Such a downer
[9811.28 --> 9812.44]  Seriously
[9812.44 --> 9813.30]  Like does that
[9813.30 --> 9813.94]  Make you happy
[9813.94 --> 9814.94]  To be unhappy
[9814.94 --> 9815.44]  Yes
[9815.44 --> 9816.90]  Except I'm not
[9816.90 --> 9817.26]  Unhappy
[9817.26 --> 9818.24]  But it makes me
[9818.24 --> 9818.88]  Happy to be a
[9818.88 --> 9819.62]  Downer about that
[9819.62 --> 9820.08]  So you want
[9820.08 --> 9820.62]  Everyone else
[9820.62 --> 9821.12]  To be unhappy
[9821.12 --> 9821.78]  Because you should
[9821.78 --> 9822.68]  Just buy a normal
[9822.68 --> 9823.28]  One and then if
[9823.28 --> 9823.72]  You really want
[9823.72 --> 9824.18]  To be a minion
[9824.18 --> 9824.68]  You should make
[9824.68 --> 9825.16]  It look like a
[9825.16 --> 9825.36]  Minion
[9825.36 --> 9827.58]  You don't need
[9827.58 --> 9828.26]  To buy like
[9828.26 --> 9829.94]  Products that are
[9829.94 --> 9831.02]  Just super weirdly
[9831.02 --> 9831.62]  Branded
[9831.62 --> 9833.32]  And probably up
[9833.32 --> 9833.94]  Priced like a
[9833.94 --> 9834.56]  Huge amount
[9834.56 --> 9835.30]  For no reason
[9835.30 --> 9836.10]  It's very
[9836.10 --> 9836.76]  Unnecessary
[9836.76 --> 9839.26]  Just modify it
[9839.26 --> 9840.12]  Make it your own
[9840.12 --> 9841.22]  There are
[9841.22 --> 9841.88]  Yeah I don't
[9841.88 --> 9842.04]  Know
[9842.04 --> 9844.12]  I don't think
[9844.12 --> 9844.64]  This happened
[9844.64 --> 9845.28]  I do know
[9845.28 --> 9846.12]  Sometimes that
[9846.12 --> 9847.38]  Like users
[9847.38 --> 9847.82]  Won't really
[9847.82 --> 9848.64]  Understand the
[9848.64 --> 9849.08]  Pressure that
[9849.08 --> 9850.28]  Moderators come
[9850.28 --> 9851.02]  Under when
[9851.02 --> 9851.64]  Things are going
[9851.64 --> 9852.42]  Just absolutely
[9852.42 --> 9853.14]  Wild
[9853.14 --> 9853.50]  Yep
[9853.50 --> 9855.38]  And what
[9855.38 --> 9856.22]  Can sometimes
[9856.22 --> 9856.84]  Happen which
[9856.84 --> 9857.34]  Doesn't really
[9857.34 --> 9857.84]  Look like this
[9857.84 --> 9858.46]  Happened so
[9858.46 --> 9858.94]  I don't know
[9858.94 --> 9859.92]  But what I was
[9859.92 --> 9860.38]  Kind of talking
[9860.38 --> 9860.72]  About there
[9860.72 --> 9862.04]  What can sometimes
[9862.04 --> 9862.72]  Happen is to let
[9862.72 --> 9863.72]  One post through
[9863.72 --> 9865.30]  And like pin it
[9865.30 --> 9866.16]  And then just
[9866.16 --> 9866.90]  Delete everything
[9866.90 --> 9867.52]  Else because
[9867.52 --> 9867.96]  They're like we
[9867.96 --> 9868.34]  Don't want to
[9868.34 --> 9868.94]  Sift through all
[9868.94 --> 9869.36]  This and try to
[9869.36 --> 9869.82]  Figure this out
[9869.82 --> 9872.44]  But yeah I
[9872.44 --> 9872.72]  Don't know
[9872.72 --> 9873.86]  I could write
[9873.86 --> 9874.62]  Better lyrics than
[9874.62 --> 9875.34]  That AI song
[9875.34 --> 9877.12]  Sorry I was just
[9877.12 --> 9877.52]  Looking at the
[9877.52 --> 9878.28]  Lyrics I'm sure
[9878.28 --> 9878.68]  You were saying
[9878.68 --> 9879.32]  Something interesting
[9879.32 --> 9880.12]  Very good
[9880.12 --> 9880.80]  Which one
[9880.80 --> 9882.10]  The Turpentine
[9882.10 --> 9882.56]  The Pilk one
[9882.56 --> 9883.04]  Turpentine
[9883.04 --> 9884.00]  Oh yeah
[9884.00 --> 9884.42]  Yeah
[9884.42 --> 9885.82]  Was that on
[9885.82 --> 9886.34]  The same
[9886.34 --> 9887.02]  Yudio was that
[9887.02 --> 9887.56]  On Yudio was
[9887.56 --> 9888.28]  That on Suno
[9888.28 --> 9888.80]  People are talking
[9888.80 --> 9890.04]  About Suno
[9890.04 --> 9892.12]  Suno
[9892.12 --> 9892.46]  Suno
[9892.46 --> 9893.06]  Suno whatever
[9893.06 --> 9893.32]  Yeah
[9893.32 --> 9894.94]  Wild
[9894.94 --> 9896.72]  Also I was
[9896.72 --> 9897.34]  Listening to you
[9897.34 --> 9897.74]  You were saying
[9897.74 --> 9898.94]  People on reddit
[9898.94 --> 9900.28]  Single pinned post
[9900.28 --> 9901.08]  I think this is
[9901.08 --> 9901.92]  Going to become
[9901.92 --> 9903.42]  I don't know
[9903.42 --> 9905.12]  Why is there so
[9905.12 --> 9905.86]  Many more Suno
[9905.86 --> 9906.70]  Posts in
[9906.70 --> 9907.30]  I can
[9907.30 --> 9908.74]  I can 100%
[9908.74 --> 9910.02]  See people just
[9910.02 --> 9910.84]  Putting on
[9910.84 --> 9911.76]  Play me some
[9911.76 --> 9912.88]  Here's here's
[9912.88 --> 9913.80]  Some songs I like
[9913.80 --> 9914.66]  Play me some
[9914.66 --> 9915.44]  Random bullshit
[9915.44 --> 9917.00]  That is stuff
[9917.00 --> 9917.60]  I might like
[9917.60 --> 9918.14]  And then you just
[9918.14 --> 9918.60]  Thumbs up and
[9918.60 --> 9919.14]  Thumbs down it
[9919.14 --> 9919.52]  And then it just
[9919.52 --> 9920.46]  Algorithmically feeds
[9920.46 --> 9920.78]  You
[9920.78 --> 9922.88]  Literally
[9922.88 --> 9924.10]  An unlimited
[9924.10 --> 9924.92]  Fire hose
[9924.92 --> 9927.00]  Of new music
[9927.00 --> 9927.46]  You've never
[9927.46 --> 9927.92]  Heard of
[9927.92 --> 9928.50]  And I use the
[9928.50 --> 9929.28]  Term music
[9929.28 --> 9930.70]  With finger quotes
[9930.70 --> 9931.88]  For the rest
[9931.88 --> 9932.32]  Of your life
[9932.32 --> 9933.02]  Like this is
[9933.02 --> 9934.50]  This is
[9934.50 --> 9935.82]  Life changing
[9935.82 --> 9936.36]  You know how
[9936.36 --> 9936.84]  Sometimes there'll
[9936.84 --> 9937.24]  Be like an
[9937.24 --> 9937.94]  Alternative YouTube
[9937.94 --> 9938.74]  Platform that'll
[9938.74 --> 9939.08]  Go up
[9939.08 --> 9939.36]  Yeah
[9939.36 --> 9939.78]  And they'll
[9939.78 --> 9940.46]  Get promoted
[9940.46 --> 9940.98]  Like crazy
[9940.98 --> 9941.56]  And then you
[9941.56 --> 9942.02]  Go on there
[9942.02 --> 9942.60]  And all the
[9942.60 --> 9943.18]  Videos have
[9943.18 --> 9943.82]  Like 10 views
[9943.82 --> 9945.40]  That's not the
[9945.40 --> 9945.68]  Case
[9945.68 --> 9947.72]  I'm on Suno
[9947.72 --> 9949.32]  Suno shows off
[9949.32 --> 9950.78]  Things more than
[9950.78 --> 9951.36]  Yudio as far
[9951.36 --> 9951.90]  As I can tell
[9951.90 --> 9953.02]  I only ate
[9953.02 --> 9954.06]  Three cheeseburgers
[9954.06 --> 9954.58]  Has a quarter
[9954.58 --> 9955.44]  Million plays
[9955.44 --> 9957.78]  Scroll down a
[9957.78 --> 9958.30]  Little bit
[9958.30 --> 9960.36]  Cat has almost
[9960.36 --> 9961.12]  Half a million
[9961.12 --> 9963.42]  Capybara has
[9963.42 --> 9963.94]  Over a quarter
[9963.94 --> 9964.20]  Million
[9964.20 --> 9964.70]  Of course we're
[9964.70 --> 9965.32]  Taking their word
[9965.32 --> 9965.78]  For this
[9965.78 --> 9967.08]  Yes that's a
[9967.08 --> 9967.78]  Pretty big deal
[9967.78 --> 9968.80]  Deep night has
[9968.80 --> 9969.60]  A quarter million
[9969.60 --> 9972.68]  It's very easy
[9972.68 --> 9973.78]  And quite common
[9973.78 --> 9975.68]  To I'll just
[9975.68 --> 9978.54]  Say that view
[9978.54 --> 9979.02]  Counts are not
[9979.02 --> 9979.48]  Always super
[9979.48 --> 9980.12]  Accurate and it's
[9980.12 --> 9980.82]  Very easy for them
[9980.82 --> 9981.82]  To not be super
[9981.82 --> 9982.82]  Accurate and I
[9982.82 --> 9983.84]  Think it's I have
[9983.84 --> 9985.32]  Personally deemed
[9985.32 --> 9986.24]  That a decent
[9986.24 --> 9986.84]  Amount of it is
[9986.84 --> 9987.78]  Intentional so
[9987.78 --> 9988.78]  Maybe but I have
[9988.78 --> 9990.44]  No idea I've
[9990.44 --> 9990.88]  Never heard of the
[9990.88 --> 9991.62]  Site but a lot
[9991.62 --> 9992.32]  Of people in chat
[9992.32 --> 9992.96]  Had known about it
[9992.96 --> 9993.60]  The second we
[9993.60 --> 9994.06]  Started talking
[9994.06 --> 9994.80]  About Yudio people
[9994.80 --> 9995.54]  Were posting a
[9995.54 --> 9996.06]  Bunch of links
[9996.06 --> 9997.44]  From Suno
[9997.44 --> 9997.90]  Wild
[9997.90 --> 10000.46]  Instagram is
[10000.46 --> 10000.90]  Going to be
[10000.90 --> 10001.34]  Adding a new
[10001.34 --> 10002.06]  Filtering feature
[10002.06 --> 10002.88]  Which detects
[10002.88 --> 10003.56]  And blurs
[10003.56 --> 10004.24]  Images that are
[10004.24 --> 10005.06]  Likely to contain
[10005.06 --> 10005.58]  Nudity
[10005.58 --> 10006.62]  This filtering
[10006.62 --> 10007.30]  Will reportedly
[10007.30 --> 10008.22]  Use on device
[10008.22 --> 10009.00]  Analysis so
[10009.00 --> 10009.46]  That's good
[10009.46 --> 10010.28]  Meaning that it
[10010.28 --> 10011.12]  Also works with
[10011.12 --> 10011.72]  End to end
[10011.72 --> 10012.20]  Encryption
[10012.20 --> 10013.22]  The feature will
[10013.22 --> 10014.12]  Also prompt users
[10014.12 --> 10014.90]  Who appear to be
[10014.90 --> 10015.92]  Attempting to send
[10015.92 --> 10016.48]  A nude photo
[10016.48 --> 10017.60]  To think twice
[10017.60 --> 10018.42]  Before sending
[10018.42 --> 10019.06]  Nude images
[10019.06 --> 10020.58]  Nudity filtering
[10020.58 --> 10021.18]  Will be turned on
[10021.18 --> 10021.78]  By default
[10021.78 --> 10022.52]  For all users
[10022.52 --> 10023.22]  Under 18
[10023.22 --> 10024.08]  Meaning
[10024.08 --> 10024.86]  Instagram is
[10024.86 --> 10025.22]  Dead
[10025.22 --> 10029.00]  No they'll
[10029.00 --> 10029.52]  Just lie about
[10029.52 --> 10030.06]  What age they are
[10030.06 --> 10031.68]  I don't know
[10031.68 --> 10032.86]  I don't know
[10032.86 --> 10033.26]  If they
[10033.26 --> 10034.54]  If they're doing
[10034.54 --> 10034.94]  This
[10034.94 --> 10036.32]  Presumably they
[10036.32 --> 10037.04]  Have some kind
[10037.04 --> 10037.52]  Of intent
[10037.52 --> 10038.34]  To enforce
[10038.34 --> 10038.70]  This
[10038.70 --> 10040.04]  I don't think
[10040.04 --> 10040.32]  It's going to
[10040.32 --> 10040.86]  Be that hard
[10040.86 --> 10041.36]  For them to
[10041.36 --> 10042.06]  Figure out
[10042.06 --> 10043.52]  If users
[10043.52 --> 10044.80]  Under the
[10044.80 --> 10045.62]  Legal age
[10045.62 --> 10046.64]  Are sending
[10046.64 --> 10047.68]  Nudity of
[10047.68 --> 10048.30]  Themselves
[10048.30 --> 10048.82]  Like
[10048.82 --> 10049.84]  Oh I see
[10049.84 --> 10051.86]  And
[10051.86 --> 10052.50]  Yeah
[10052.50 --> 10053.92]  I thought
[10053.92 --> 10054.30]  Of this
[10054.30 --> 10054.78]  As
[10054.78 --> 10055.96]  Wait hold
[10055.96 --> 10056.24]  On
[10056.24 --> 10057.36]  Yeah I think
[10057.36 --> 10058.06]  The filter
[10058.06 --> 10058.90]  Is for
[10058.90 --> 10060.72]  Receivers of
[10060.72 --> 10061.06]  The images
[10061.06 --> 10061.26]  Yes
[10061.26 --> 10062.04]  Yeah
[10062.04 --> 10063.16]  It's not
[10063.16 --> 10063.54]  Senders
[10063.54 --> 10064.26]  I think the
[10064.26 --> 10064.92]  Warning is just
[10064.92 --> 10065.18]  For senders
[10065.18 --> 10065.42]  Yeah the
[10065.42 --> 10065.94]  Warning is for
[10065.94 --> 10066.20]  Senders
[10066.20 --> 10066.50]  Yeah
[10066.50 --> 10067.36]  So it just
[10067.36 --> 10067.78]  Seems like
[10067.78 --> 10068.18]  They're headed
[10068.18 --> 10068.84]  In a direction
[10068.84 --> 10069.20]  Now that
[10069.20 --> 10069.38]  They've
[10069.38 --> 10069.94]  Acknowledged
[10069.94 --> 10070.50]  The problem
[10070.50 --> 10071.08]  Yeah
[10071.08 --> 10071.74]  They kind
[10071.74 --> 10072.00]  Of have
[10072.00 --> 10072.24]  To do
[10072.24 --> 10072.58]  Something
[10072.58 --> 10072.94]  Yeah
[10072.94 --> 10073.72]  And if
[10073.72 --> 10074.04]  They do
[10074.04 --> 10074.44]  Something
[10074.44 --> 10075.58]  They're done
[10075.58 --> 10075.92]  I wonder
[10075.92 --> 10076.56]  How much
[10076.56 --> 10077.04]  Of
[10077.04 --> 10078.86]  Like if
[10078.86 --> 10079.28]  I wonder
[10079.28 --> 10079.76]  How hard
[10079.76 --> 10080.00]  It would
[10080.00 --> 10080.94]  Be to
[10080.94 --> 10081.30]  Deal with
[10081.30 --> 10081.84]  The processing
[10081.84 --> 10082.20]  Of this
[10082.20 --> 10082.70]  For twitter
[10082.70 --> 10084.42]  Oh man
[10084.42 --> 10086.34]  I don't
[10086.34 --> 10086.94]  Read through
[10086.94 --> 10087.58]  Public threads
[10087.58 --> 10087.88]  Anymore
[10087.88 --> 10088.42]  You can't
[10088.42 --> 10088.68]  Yeah
[10088.68 --> 10089.26]  If it's
[10089.26 --> 10089.80]  A thread
[10089.80 --> 10090.08]  Of like
[10090.08 --> 10090.48]  Someone I
[10090.48 --> 10090.86]  Know I
[10090.86 --> 10091.22]  Might click
[10091.22 --> 10091.50]  On it
[10091.50 --> 10091.80]  If it's
[10091.80 --> 10092.10]  Not I
[10092.10 --> 10092.52]  Just don't
[10092.52 --> 10092.94]  If it's
[10092.94 --> 10093.82]  Very trending
[10093.82 --> 10094.16]  I just
[10094.16 --> 10094.48]  Don't click
[10094.48 --> 10094.64]  On it
[10094.64 --> 10094.96]  It's just
[10094.96 --> 10095.34]  Full of
[10095.34 --> 10095.66]  Bums
[10095.66 --> 10096.06]  Yeah
[10096.06 --> 10097.68]  Click on
[10097.68 --> 10097.94]  My
[10097.94 --> 10098.42]  Whatever
[10098.42 --> 10099.18]  Yeah
[10099.18 --> 10099.82]  Top
[10099.82 --> 10100.14]  Whatever
[10100.14 --> 10100.58]  Percent
[10100.58 --> 10101.02]  Yep
[10101.02 --> 10101.90]  Yep
[10101.90 --> 10102.24]  And the
[10102.24 --> 10102.58]  Text will
[10102.58 --> 10102.74]  Have
[10102.74 --> 10103.22]  Absolutely
[10103.22 --> 10103.58]  Nothing
[10103.58 --> 10103.94]  To do
[10103.94 --> 10104.22]  With the
[10104.22 --> 10104.62]  Imagery
[10104.62 --> 10104.96]  Nope
[10104.96 --> 10106.92]  According to
[10106.92 --> 10107.16]  Meta
[10107.16 --> 10107.76]  This is not
[10107.76 --> 10108.26]  Only to
[10108.26 --> 10108.76]  Protect people
[10108.76 --> 10109.20]  From seeing
[10109.20 --> 10109.74]  Unwanted
[10109.74 --> 10110.14]  Nudity
[10110.14 --> 10110.62]  But also
[10110.62 --> 10111.08]  To protect
[10111.08 --> 10111.44]  Them from
[10111.44 --> 10111.96]  Scammers
[10111.96 --> 10112.36]  Who use
[10112.36 --> 10112.78]  Nude images
[10112.78 --> 10113.28]  To catch
[10113.28 --> 10113.72]  Fish users
[10113.72 --> 10114.94]  Into sending
[10114.94 --> 10115.44]  Them extortion
[10115.44 --> 10115.88]  Material
[10115.88 --> 10116.32]  Yes
[10116.32 --> 10117.86]  That is
[10117.86 --> 10118.86]  Very important
[10118.86 --> 10119.40]  And honestly
[10119.40 --> 10119.98]  I agree
[10119.98 --> 10120.04]  How's it
[10120.04 --> 10120.32]  Going to do
[10120.32 --> 10120.58]  That
[10120.58 --> 10121.18]  This seems
[10121.18 --> 10122.38]  The intent
[10122.38 --> 10123.20]  Seems great
[10123.20 --> 10123.62]  How's it
[10123.62 --> 10123.92]  Going to do
[10123.92 --> 10124.12]  That
[10124.12 --> 10124.60]  Both warnings
[10124.60 --> 10126.82]  So it
[10126.82 --> 10127.44]  Warns the
[10127.44 --> 10127.80]  Sender
[10127.80 --> 10128.40]  Yeah
[10128.40 --> 10128.90]  It warns the
[10128.90 --> 10129.18]  Sender
[10129.18 --> 10130.08]  And it
[10130.08 --> 10130.82]  Blurs the
[10130.82 --> 10131.36]  Blurs the
[10131.36 --> 10131.84]  Imagery
[10131.84 --> 10133.26]  Basically
[10133.26 --> 10133.76]  They're putting
[10133.76 --> 10134.54]  Barriers in
[10134.54 --> 10135.42]  Place for
[10135.42 --> 10136.12]  Sexting
[10136.12 --> 10136.64]  I don't
[10136.64 --> 10137.02]  Think it's
[10137.02 --> 10137.24]  Going to
[10137.24 --> 10137.54]  Do
[10137.54 --> 10138.22]  The
[10138.22 --> 10138.54]  The
[10138.54 --> 10139.44]  Also protect
[10139.44 --> 10139.86]  Them from
[10139.86 --> 10140.24]  Scammers
[10140.24 --> 10140.82]  Who use
[10140.82 --> 10141.30]  Nude images
[10141.30 --> 10141.80]  To catfish
[10141.80 --> 10142.04]  Users
[10142.04 --> 10142.64]  It's not
[10142.64 --> 10142.76]  Going to
[10142.76 --> 10142.96]  Do that
[10142.96 --> 10143.20]  At all
[10143.20 --> 10143.86]  If people
[10143.86 --> 10144.40]  Wanted to
[10144.40 --> 10144.72]  See that
[10144.72 --> 10145.00]  Image
[10145.00 --> 10145.36]  They're just
[10145.36 --> 10145.62]  Going to
[10145.62 --> 10146.08]  Turn the
[10146.08 --> 10146.66]  Filter off
[10146.66 --> 10147.10]  Sure
[10147.10 --> 10147.60]  That's fair
[10147.60 --> 10147.90]  Enough
[10147.90 --> 10148.36]  But
[10148.36 --> 10149.28]  I'm not
[10149.28 --> 10150.08]  Saying the
[10150.08 --> 10150.52]  Goal is
[10150.52 --> 10151.04]  Like bad
[10151.04 --> 10151.48]  Or anything
[10151.48 --> 10151.84]  I just
[10151.84 --> 10152.24]  That's
[10152.24 --> 10152.56]  That's not
[10152.56 --> 10152.72]  Going to
[10152.72 --> 10152.88]  Happen
[10152.88 --> 10153.30]  I'm just
[10153.30 --> 10153.54]  Saying
[10153.54 --> 10153.88]  Look
[10153.88 --> 10154.72]  I'm just
[10154.72 --> 10154.84]  Say
[10154.84 --> 10155.64]  Twitter roulette
[10155.64 --> 10156.34]  Look at
[10156.34 --> 10156.74]  The comment
[10156.74 --> 10157.48]  Section of
[10157.48 --> 10158.22]  Any trending
[10158.22 --> 10158.68]  Tweet in
[10158.68 --> 10159.00]  Public
[10159.00 --> 10162.62]  There's a
[10162.62 --> 10163.04]  Bullet in
[10163.04 --> 10163.82]  Every chamber
[10163.82 --> 10164.52]  I have
[10164.52 --> 10165.14]  Specifically
[10165.14 --> 10166.20]  Opened and
[10166.20 --> 10166.72]  Then immediately
[10166.72 --> 10167.54]  Reflectively been
[10167.54 --> 10168.26]  Like oh jeez
[10168.26 --> 10168.88]  And closed
[10168.88 --> 10169.70]  Twitter before
[10169.70 --> 10170.50]  Because I was
[10170.50 --> 10171.00]  Like I'm in
[10171.00 --> 10171.56]  Public and I
[10171.56 --> 10172.50]  Can't really
[10172.50 --> 10173.36]  Guarantee that
[10173.36 --> 10174.02]  What comes up
[10174.02 --> 10174.38]  Is going to
[10174.38 --> 10175.04]  Be okay
[10175.04 --> 10175.64]  Oh yeah
[10175.64 --> 10176.20]  100%
[10176.20 --> 10176.74]  Nope
[10176.74 --> 10181.28]  Anyway my
[10181.28 --> 10181.94]  Point was just
[10181.94 --> 10182.76]  This direction
[10182.76 --> 10183.12]  That they're
[10183.12 --> 10183.88]  Heading in
[10183.88 --> 10184.46]  This goal
[10184.46 --> 10185.90]  Seems admirable
[10185.90 --> 10186.54]  Seems good
[10186.54 --> 10187.50]  The fact that
[10187.50 --> 10187.98]  They didn't
[10187.98 --> 10188.48]  Weren't working
[10188.48 --> 10189.14]  On this already
[10189.14 --> 10189.82]  Is the
[10189.82 --> 10190.44]  Opposite of
[10190.44 --> 10190.94]  All of that
[10190.94 --> 10191.50]  And now that
[10191.50 --> 10191.84]  They're doing
[10191.84 --> 10192.56]  This I just
[10192.56 --> 10192.90]  Don't think
[10192.90 --> 10193.26]  People are
[10193.26 --> 10193.40]  Going to
[10193.40 --> 10193.72]  Use it
[10193.72 --> 10194.36]  I mean
[10194.36 --> 10194.78]  It's no
[10194.78 --> 10195.22]  It's no
[10195.22 --> 10195.78]  Secret that
[10195.78 --> 10196.82]  People use
[10196.82 --> 10197.50]  The least
[10197.50 --> 10199.26]  Nannied
[10199.26 --> 10199.90]  Platform
[10199.90 --> 10200.82]  Because that's
[10200.82 --> 10201.10]  What they
[10201.10 --> 10202.00]  Want to do
[10202.00 --> 10202.60]  Yeah
[10202.60 --> 10204.26]  Avery studios
[10204.26 --> 10204.66]  And flowplane
[10204.66 --> 10205.02]  Says they
[10205.02 --> 10205.64]  Already warn
[10205.64 --> 10206.28]  About violent
[10206.28 --> 10207.26]  Content etc
[10207.26 --> 10207.74]  If you said
[10207.74 --> 10208.14]  It so
[10208.14 --> 10208.64]  This looks
[10208.64 --> 10208.94]  Like an
[10208.94 --> 10209.58]  Expansion of
[10209.58 --> 10209.96]  Something that
[10209.96 --> 10210.46]  They kind of
[10210.46 --> 10210.86]  Already do
[10210.86 --> 10211.90]  Content warnings

[10900.08 --> 10900.40]  Interesting

[10900.64 --> 10900.88]  You

[10906.62 --> 10906.82]  I
[10906.82 --> 10907.02]  Think
[10907.02 --> 10907.36]  It's
[10907.36 --> 10907.64]  Not
[10907.64 --> 10907.92]  The

[10911.60 --> 10913.08]  Yeah
[10913.08 --> 10913.62]  So
[10913.62 --> 10913.92]  Like
[10913.92 --> 10914.50]  Well
[10914.50 --> 10914.64]  I'm

[11021.80 --> 11022.04]  Idea
[11022.04 --> 11022.48]  I
[11022.48 --> 11022.76]  Wonder

[11025.50 --> 11025.74]  Of
[11025.74 --> 11026.50]  Frugality
[11026.50 --> 11027.56]  Maybe
[11027.56 --> 11027.98]  I
[11027.98 --> 11028.14]  Try

[11036.12 --> 11036.22]  Is
[11036.22 --> 11036.36]  Any
[11036.36 --> 11036.52]  Higher
[11036.52 --> 11036.70]  Than
[11036.70 --> 11037.06]  Absolutely
[11037.06 --> 11037.30]  Have

[11037.40 --> 11037.58]  Be
[11037.58 --> 11038.24]  I
[11038.24 --> 11038.96]  Will
[11038.96 --> 11039.72]  Be
[11039.72 --> 11040.20]  Really
[11040.20 --> 11040.74]  Annoying
[11040.74 --> 11041.14]  About
[11041.14 --> 11041.42]  Like
[11041.42 --> 11041.62]  If
[11041.62 --> 11041.78]  The
[11041.78 --> 11042.10]  Light's
[11042.10 --> 11042.38]  Red

[11043.40 --> 11044.28]  Advancing
[11044.28 --> 11044.62]  Towards
[11044.62 --> 11044.80]  It
[11044.80 --> 11046.34]  I
[11046.34 --> 11046.58]  Will
[11046.58 --> 11047.20]  Generally
[11047.20 --> 11047.60]  Slow
[11047.60 --> 11047.92]  Down
[11047.92 --> 11048.06]  And
[11048.06 --> 11048.16]  If
[11048.16 --> 11048.26]  I
[11048.26 --> 11048.42]  Can
[11048.42 --> 11048.68]  Not
[11048.68 --> 11049.20]  Stop
[11049.20 --> 11049.40]  Oh
[11049.40 --> 11049.58]  Yeah
[11049.58 --> 11049.88]  So
[11049.88 --> 11049.98]  I
[11049.98 --> 11050.10]  Can
[11050.10 --> 11050.26]  Just
[11050.26 --> 11050.46]  Get
[11050.46 --> 11050.78]  Really
[11050.78 --> 11051.20]  Slow
[11051.20 --> 11051.78]  100%
[11051.78 --> 11052.28]  And
[11052.28 --> 11052.46]  Then
[11052.46 --> 11052.72]  Keep
[11052.72 --> 11053.06]  Going
[11053.06 --> 11053.44]  Drivers
[11053.44 --> 11053.70]  Behind
[11053.70 --> 11053.88]  You
[11053.88 --> 11054.16]  Hate
[11054.16 --> 11054.26]  It
[11054.26 --> 11054.44]  Here
[11054.44 --> 11055.04]  I
[11055.04 --> 11055.26]  Don't
[11055.26 --> 11055.48]  Know
[11055.48 --> 11055.80]  Why
[11055.80 --> 11056.00]  I
[11056.00 --> 11056.10]  I
[11056.10 --> 11056.50]  I
[11056.50 --> 11057.58]  I
[11057.58 --> 11059.08]  Don't
[11059.08 --> 11059.24]  Get
[11059.24 --> 11059.44]  It
[11059.44 --> 11060.02]  Yeah
[11060.02 --> 11061.04]  Whatever
[11061.04 --> 11061.80]  I
[11061.80 --> 11061.96]  Don't
[11061.96 --> 11062.24]  Remember
[11062.24 --> 11062.42]  What
[11062.42 --> 11062.54]  The
[11062.54 --> 11062.84]  Question
[11062.84 --> 11063.14]  Was
[11063.14 --> 11063.30]  But
[11063.30 --> 11063.52]  Maybe
[11063.52 --> 11063.72]  That
[11063.72 --> 11064.18]  Adequately
[11064.18 --> 11064.56]  Addressed
[11064.56 --> 11064.76]  It
[11064.76 --> 11065.20]  Oh
[11065.20 --> 11065.32]  I
[11065.32 --> 11065.48]  Think
[11065.48 --> 11065.62]  I
[11065.62 --> 11065.74]  Think
[11065.74 --> 11065.92]  I
[11065.92 --> 11066.08]  Might
[11066.08 --> 11066.30]  Have
[11066.30 --> 11066.42]  A
[11066.42 --> 11066.64]  Feature
[11066.64 --> 11066.90]  Actually
[11066.90 --> 11067.16]  Based
[11067.16 --> 11067.30]  On
[11067.30 --> 11067.48]  Something
[11067.48 --> 11067.66]  That
[11067.66 --> 11068.00]  I
[11068.00 --> 11068.36]  Kind
[11068.36 --> 11068.42]  Of
[11068.42 --> 11068.58]  Like
[11068.58 --> 11068.86]  Sure
[11068.86 --> 11069.14]  You
[11069.14 --> 11069.32]  Know
[11069.34 --> 11070.58]  Efficient
[11070.58 --> 11070.92]  Car
[11070.92 --> 11071.38]  Driving
[11071.38 --> 11071.88]  Promoter
[11071.88 --> 11072.40]  Things
[11072.40 --> 11072.76]  In
[11072.76 --> 11073.10]  Cars
[11073.10 --> 11073.50]  Will
[11073.50 --> 11073.84]  Usually
[11073.84 --> 11074.14]  Be
[11074.14 --> 11074.98]  When
[11074.98 --> 11075.12]  You're
[11075.12 --> 11075.42]  Doing
[11075.42 --> 11075.80]  Well
[11075.80 --> 11075.96]  It
[11075.96 --> 11076.08]  Will
[11076.08 --> 11076.44]  Grow
[11076.44 --> 11076.62]  A
[11076.62 --> 11076.86]  Tree
[11076.86 --> 11077.04]  Or
[11077.04 --> 11077.28]  Whatever
[11077.28 --> 11078.12]  I
[11078.12 --> 11079.86]  I think I want the negativity version.
[11080.38 --> 11081.56]  You want a negativity version.
[11081.88 --> 11082.02]  Yeah.
[11082.08 --> 11086.92]  So every time you stomp on your accelerator, they murder a squirrel?
[11087.10 --> 11088.18]  Like, what are you asking for?
[11088.24 --> 11092.46]  It'll be like, oh, hey, looks like you, like, really pushed it there.
[11092.72 --> 11094.82]  That cost you this many extra dollars.
[11096.30 --> 11101.58]  And it's like when you get to the end of the drive, instead of being like, great job, you saved the planet every single time,
[11101.58 --> 11104.10]  it'll be like, hmm, that was actually kind of rough.
[11104.84 --> 11108.66]  You could have saved six extra bucks this drive if you didn't drive like that.
[11108.74 --> 11110.66]  That was 9% worse than your best.
[11111.48 --> 11111.74]  Yeah.
[11112.50 --> 11112.94]  Interesting.
[11113.12 --> 11115.74]  So gamify your driving efficiency.
[11115.74 --> 11117.26]  I found a way to gamify another thing.
[11117.62 --> 11118.46]  Okay, that's pretty cool.
[11118.70 --> 11119.68]  I kind of like that.
[11120.00 --> 11125.48]  Yeah, with, I think, a focus on kind of the drawbacks of it being bad.
[11125.60 --> 11126.88]  Oh, man, that'd be so cool.
[11127.06 --> 11129.80]  You rode your brakes really hard this drive.
[11129.90 --> 11133.94]  So you could compete, as long as they anonymized the data and didn't sell it to anyone,
[11133.94 --> 11135.48]  which we know won't happen.
[11135.70 --> 11136.88]  So yeah, I know, Dan.
[11137.00 --> 11137.34]  I know.
[11137.52 --> 11137.98]  I'm laughing.
[11138.34 --> 11142.36]  Dan, let me live in my fantasy utopia.
[11142.72 --> 11143.02]  No.
[11143.14 --> 11144.42]  It's fun here.
[11144.56 --> 11144.98]  No.
[11145.40 --> 11145.88]  Yes.
[11145.88 --> 11153.92]  How cool would it be if it compared you to everyone else who drove the same drive at
[11153.92 --> 11155.66]  the same time of day, including yourself?
[11156.44 --> 11158.40]  And you could, like, go for the high score.
[11158.88 --> 11159.08]  Yeah.
[11159.74 --> 11160.38]  That'd be kind of neat.
[11161.22 --> 11161.60]  That'd be sick.
[11161.60 --> 11166.74]  I like the idea that instead of, yeah, I think the just grow a tree thing, like, I never really
[11166.74 --> 11167.50]  care that much.
[11168.00 --> 11168.38]  Got them.
[11169.36 --> 11170.34]  I love trees.
[11170.34 --> 11171.14]  You heard it here first.
[11171.26 --> 11171.34]  Yeah.
[11171.42 --> 11172.06]  Luke hates trees.
[11172.36 --> 11172.70]  We should plant more.
[11173.28 --> 11174.06]  Lukehatestrees.com.
[11174.24 --> 11174.48]  Et cetera, et cetera.
[11174.90 --> 11176.42]  But it's just like, I want it.
[11176.44 --> 11177.20]  I kind of want it to.
[11177.28 --> 11179.04]  I want to feel the repercussions, you know?
[11179.16 --> 11180.72]  And maybe it's like, yeah, that was worth it.
[11180.74 --> 11181.98]  I had to get someone to the hospital or something.
[11182.04 --> 11182.36]  I don't know.
[11182.60 --> 11188.44]  But a lot of the time, it's like, really, I was just totally on time driving somewhere
[11188.44 --> 11189.56]  and just driving like a butt.
[11189.56 --> 11194.98]  Maybe it should tell me that me driving like a butt cost me X percent more on my brakes
[11194.98 --> 11195.88]  that I didn't need to.
[11196.00 --> 11197.78]  Cost me this much more on my gas.
[11199.62 --> 11199.98]  Yeah.
[11200.08 --> 11200.36]  I don't know.
[11200.40 --> 11201.04]  I think that'd be interesting.
[11201.14 --> 11203.42]  Not everyone is quite as financially motivated as you, though.
[11204.70 --> 11209.22]  Like, if you told the average person that they just wasted six cents of fuel, they'd be
[11209.22 --> 11209.94]  like, eh.
[11211.02 --> 11212.92]  You'd be like, shock and awe.
[11213.34 --> 11214.30]  I could have done better.
[11214.56 --> 11218.60]  I could have had one five cent candy plus tax for that six cents.
[11219.56 --> 11220.00]  Yeah.
[11222.56 --> 11222.92]  Yeah.
[11223.06 --> 11223.38]  I don't know.
[11223.46 --> 11224.64]  I would like it, though, personally.
[11227.94 --> 11228.94]  Does Luke get underpaid?
[11229.06 --> 11229.28]  No.
[11229.44 --> 11233.20]  I just, uh, I don't enjoy spending money.
[11233.30 --> 11235.18]  I don't like the act of spending money.
[11235.30 --> 11235.90]  I'll do it.
[11236.04 --> 11238.02]  But that's not the cool part.
[11238.16 --> 11238.46]  I do.
[11238.62 --> 11238.76]  Yeah.
[11238.98 --> 11239.44]  Will he?
[11239.54 --> 11240.08]  Does he, though?
[11240.22 --> 11240.44]  Really?
[11240.76 --> 11241.02]  Does he?
[11241.02 --> 11242.32]  My birds have been at the vet for a week.
[11242.94 --> 11243.34]  Ooh.
[11243.48 --> 11244.84]  I'm spending some money.
[11245.34 --> 11245.56]  Yeah.
[11245.56 --> 11246.22]  He's spending money.
[11246.68 --> 11247.00]  Yeah.
[11247.12 --> 11247.80]  How's Wally doing?
[11247.80 --> 11249.68]  Um, actually, I do have good news.
[11249.86 --> 11250.28]  Oh, good.
[11250.54 --> 11250.74]  Yeah.
[11250.88 --> 11252.72]  So they did, they did a blood draw.
[11253.02 --> 11255.50]  Doing a blood draw on budgies is like super sketch.
[11256.02 --> 11256.30]  Um.
[11256.52 --> 11257.94]  How much blood do they have?
[11258.66 --> 11259.06]  Exactly.
[11259.56 --> 11260.16]  That's, that's the problem.
[11260.16 --> 11261.02]  No, but seriously.
[11261.16 --> 11263.20]  Like, how many milliliters of blood do they have?
[11263.20 --> 11264.74]  I don't know exactly, but it's very small.
[11264.98 --> 11266.36]  There's, there's the, I like this quote.
[11266.64 --> 11268.70]  Uh, humans, you know, were mostly made of water.
[11269.18 --> 11270.46]  Birds, mostly made of air.
[11270.58 --> 11271.24]  Or at least budgies.
[11271.66 --> 11273.54]  So like, there isn't a lot there.
[11273.54 --> 11274.82]  So it's really dangerous.
[11274.82 --> 11278.18]  But the vet was like, yeah, we, we're not 100% certain what's going on.
[11278.24 --> 11279.02]  We need more information.
[11279.54 --> 11280.36]  Um, so they did it.
[11280.54 --> 11281.10]  Survived that.
[11281.18 --> 11281.56]  That's good.
[11281.72 --> 11284.30]  They detected that it was probably something to do with liver problems.
[11284.92 --> 11289.32]  So they started giving, uh, antibiotics, specifically targeting the liver to both birds.
[11289.54 --> 11290.82]  Both birds saw an improvement.
[11291.22 --> 11295.52]  Um, and it's at the point that Wally, which was one that was struggling, is no longer in
[11295.52 --> 11297.66]  an incubator as of today.
[11297.66 --> 11301.40]  And they're in the same cage again, as of today, which is good because they're extremely
[11301.40 --> 11302.14]  social animals.
[11302.82 --> 11303.88]  They're still monitoring them.
[11303.96 --> 11306.50]  I'm really hoping I'm going to get a call tomorrow that I can pick them up.
[11307.40 --> 11311.52]  One, because I want my birds back, but then also because it's really expensive.
[11312.58 --> 11313.22]  Fair enough.
[11313.44 --> 11313.62]  Yeah.
[11314.44 --> 11316.16]  Birds are mostly air.com.
[11316.78 --> 11317.98]  Oh my God.
[11319.80 --> 11322.50]  Everyone that you said so far has been turned into something.
[11322.62 --> 11325.64]  And I'm like trying to dissuade people not to do it because they keep posting in a full
[11325.64 --> 11325.80]  page.
[11325.88 --> 11327.04]  I'm like, we're not going to click on it.
[11327.04 --> 11328.52]  It's like, we're, we're not going to do it.
[11328.52 --> 11330.00]  We're not going to acknowledge it.
[11330.04 --> 11332.32]  You could be harvesting our IPs or doing whatever else.
[11332.32 --> 11332.68]  Exactly.
[11332.80 --> 11334.70]  Someone might've already, oh my goodness.
[11335.94 --> 11336.64]  Too late.
[11336.86 --> 11338.68]  Oh, that's too fast.
[11340.30 --> 11341.26]  My goodness.
[11341.44 --> 11341.84]  Okay.
[11342.04 --> 11342.56]  All right.
[11342.58 --> 11345.52]  I think we're ready for our next merch messenger live.
[11345.62 --> 11346.40]  Thank you very much.
[11346.40 --> 11346.94]  Thank you so much.
[11347.32 --> 11351.18]  One of the people that grabbed the last domain, they're like name had DevOps in the name.
[11351.52 --> 11353.06]  They're just like, this is what they do.
[11353.32 --> 11353.72]  Nice.
[11353.90 --> 11354.50]  Oh my goodness.
[11354.62 --> 11354.96]  Welcome.
[11355.54 --> 11356.06]  Thank you.
[11356.06 --> 11360.80]  And you're not going to click on it, but I already clicked on Luke has no clue and it
[11360.80 --> 11362.36]  redirects to LTT store.com.
[11362.54 --> 11363.24]  Oh no.
[11363.38 --> 11364.44]  So you don't have to do it.
[11364.52 --> 11364.82]  I got it.
[11364.88 --> 11366.00]  At least it did two hours ago.
[11366.14 --> 11366.88]  I don't know what it does now.
[11366.88 --> 11367.52]  For now it does.
[11367.60 --> 11368.14]  Don't click on it.
[11368.14 --> 11368.72]  Don't click on it.
[11368.72 --> 11368.84]  Okay.
[11368.98 --> 11371.30]  But thanks also for having me.
[11371.38 --> 11372.12]  It's been a great day.
[11372.22 --> 11372.68]  Our pleasure.
[11373.46 --> 11378.04]  My question is, how do you handle the pressure of being a public figure in the tech industry
[11378.04 --> 11381.58]  while still prioritizing your own well-being and personal time?
[11382.46 --> 11383.88]  That's a stupid question.
[11383.88 --> 11385.88]  I obviously don't.
[11385.88 --> 11386.28]  No, no.
[11386.34 --> 11386.64]  You're good.
[11386.72 --> 11386.92]  You're good.
[11386.98 --> 11387.28]  You're good.
[11389.62 --> 11390.82]  I don't at all.
[11391.72 --> 11392.54]  Well, why not?
[11392.72 --> 11394.96]  Honestly, it's not the tech industry that's the problem.
[11395.10 --> 11396.40]  I don't work in the tech industry.
[11396.50 --> 11397.50]  That's a common misconception.
[11397.86 --> 11400.30]  I work in the media industry and I cover tech.
[11400.96 --> 11403.78]  And being in the media industry used to be-
[11403.78 --> 11404.94]  You work in the tech industry, by the way.
[11405.48 --> 11406.04]  You're actually wrong.
[11406.18 --> 11406.54]  Okay.
[11406.82 --> 11407.22]  Fine.
[11407.74 --> 11408.32]  Thank you, Luke.
[11408.50 --> 11409.02]  Yes.
[11409.18 --> 11409.44]  No problem.
[11409.44 --> 11412.68]  I also work in the clothing industry, but let's be real here.
[11412.82 --> 11415.78]  Let me modify the tech and clothing industry and media.
[11416.00 --> 11416.84]  Thank you for that.
[11417.68 --> 11419.76]  So, ah, man.
[11419.76 --> 11425.58]  See, but my problem is not any part of the working in the tech industry or the clothing
[11425.58 --> 11426.50]  industry for that matter.
[11426.58 --> 11427.98]  I actually really enjoy those parts.
[11427.98 --> 11433.70]  The parts that I find that the most pressure comes from is the media industry.
[11433.88 --> 11438.32]  And that's one where, I mean, you know, we've-
[11438.32 --> 11441.84]  It used to be a lot easier.
[11441.96 --> 11445.76]  It used to be that our biggest controversy was, hey, we need to eat.
[11446.02 --> 11449.06]  So, we have baked in sponsor spots in our videos now.
[11450.34 --> 11452.76]  Whereas now, it feels like-
[11452.76 --> 11453.46]  That was a big deal.
[11453.54 --> 11454.46]  It's also-
[11454.46 --> 11455.38]  Yeah, that was like-
[11455.38 --> 11457.96]  People hated that for years, I think.
[11457.98 --> 11460.02]  Yeah, we were on the leading edge of that.
[11460.10 --> 11465.38]  We weren't the first to do it, but we were pretty early in terms of monetizing the content
[11465.38 --> 11466.66]  outside of just AdSense.
[11466.80 --> 11467.90]  We was first in tech, right?
[11467.96 --> 11468.32]  Is that right?
[11468.86 --> 11471.22]  As far as I know, we were the first in tech.
[11471.32 --> 11476.58]  Although, ironically, no one cared when the entire channel was funded by a computer retailer.
[11476.58 --> 11483.40]  I never actually really thought about that before, but that's pretty funny.
[11483.42 --> 11488.10]  Well, no, it's one of those things where people are so selectively outraged, right?
[11488.10 --> 11502.70]  How dare you compromise your integrity by promoting Intel's win a snowboard competition for Core i7 when you used to be-
[11502.70 --> 11504.48]  Used to be what?
[11504.58 --> 11506.54]  A salesman at a computer store.
[11506.54 --> 11508.68]  This is a step forward.
[11510.44 --> 11518.02]  And we've worked hard to maintain our independent voice over the years, but that was something that, you know, I guess it was jarring for people.
[11518.34 --> 11528.36]  And sometimes it's not about, you know, big picture, how big of a deal this is or how much this is actually compromising the integrity of the people or the content.
[11528.36 --> 11530.38]  And it's more just, what are you used to?
[11532.02 --> 11534.38]  What is the flavor of the week, right?
[11534.38 --> 11548.64]  And I do find the speed of the news cycle and the speed of the outrage engine to be the most exhausting part of this job.
[11550.10 --> 11556.68]  And, I mean, I said it in the I'm Thinking of Retiring stream, which maybe you've watched or maybe you haven't.
[11556.68 --> 11563.04]  And there's enough views on it that it's sort of fair for me to assume that a lot of people who watch the channel have seen it at this point.
[11563.48 --> 11564.62]  But I said it then.
[11564.66 --> 11565.26]  I said it now.
[11565.30 --> 11565.78]  I'm tired.
[11566.98 --> 11569.22]  The thing that keeps me going now is the team.
[11569.38 --> 11580.48]  We've got 100 people here who depend on me getting up and getting out of bed in the morning and, you know, being part of this thing and helping drive it and being that sort of creative voice.
[11582.02 --> 11583.40]  It's also the community.
[11583.40 --> 11586.60]  I think that what we're doing is incredibly important.
[11587.00 --> 11593.60]  And some of these things are, I think, probably not properly appreciated yet.
[11593.94 --> 11597.56]  But I understand why, because we're not done yet.
[11597.64 --> 11601.62]  They don't see what I see yet for something like the lab.
[11601.62 --> 11607.74]  They don't see necessarily why we make the decisions that we do.
[11608.20 --> 11616.96]  And so, you know, for us, another thing that drives me is doing it anyway, whether people see it and appreciate it or not.
[11618.22 --> 11619.76]  By the way, a new article on the lab.
[11620.20 --> 11620.46]  Sorry?
[11620.72 --> 11621.66]  A new article on the lab.
[11621.70 --> 11622.78]  Oh, really?
[11622.88 --> 11623.68]  I haven't seen this yet.
[11623.88 --> 11624.06]  Yeah.
[11624.24 --> 11624.48]  Sorry.
[11624.58 --> 11626.58]  I have now officially become derailed.
[11626.58 --> 11629.82]  With some pretty significant design changes based on user feedback.
[11630.44 --> 11632.00]  Well, let's check it out together, shall we?
[11632.32 --> 11632.54]  Yeah.
[11632.80 --> 11633.16]  Okay.
[11633.46 --> 11634.14]  Comparison bin.
[11634.30 --> 11635.26]  Welcome to the beta.
[11636.38 --> 11637.62]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[11637.62 --> 11638.62]  We'd love to hear your feedback.
[11638.76 --> 11640.42]  So make sure you do check that out at the top.
[11640.48 --> 11640.74]  Okay.
[11640.94 --> 11641.34]  Latest.
[11641.90 --> 11642.64]  Here we go.
[11642.72 --> 11642.84]  Okay.
[11642.88 --> 11643.62]  Oh, look at that.
[11643.68 --> 11643.98]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[11644.00 --> 11644.64]  We've got new imagery.
[11645.32 --> 11646.70]  We got a watermark now.
[11646.92 --> 11647.84]  That's pretty cool.
[11648.14 --> 11648.50]  Nice.
[11649.44 --> 11650.64]  That actually looks sharp.
[11651.44 --> 11652.06]  Oh, hold on.
[11652.26 --> 11654.34]  Is this...
[11654.34 --> 11656.58]  What makes it expand or not expand?
[11656.66 --> 11656.94]  You know what?
[11656.98 --> 11658.66]  I'm not going to worry too much about that right now.
[11658.80 --> 11660.70]  But this is...
[11660.70 --> 11662.24]  I believe this has been revised.
[11662.40 --> 11663.14]  I think you were...
[11663.14 --> 11663.32]  The summary.
[11663.32 --> 11666.22]  While you were scrolling with your fingers, I think you were actually clicking on the bars.
[11666.32 --> 11667.94]  Because you don't have to click on the actual symbol.
[11668.06 --> 11668.84]  You can click anywhere on the bar.
[11668.84 --> 11669.30]  Oh, okay.
[11669.38 --> 11670.12]  Well, very interesting.
[11671.42 --> 11674.54]  So this is something we talked about in our meeting this week.
[11674.54 --> 11677.80]  How are we going to handle what's good and what's bad over time?
[11678.54 --> 11682.20]  And we'd love to develop a system where it's kind of tag-based.
[11682.32 --> 11686.44]  And then we can decay the goodness of tags as the technology changes.
[11686.72 --> 11688.94]  For now, I think these are going to be manual.
[11689.26 --> 11692.00]  And, you know, these are going to be a product of their time.
[11692.18 --> 11696.50]  Rather than being something that can naturally...
[11696.50 --> 11701.64]  Or not naturally, but can decay in a controlled manner as our standards.
[11701.64 --> 11706.02]  You know, for what constitutes good 1440p performance evolve.
[11706.02 --> 11708.28]  But this is...
[11708.28 --> 11709.08]  This is...
[11709.08 --> 11709.98]  This looks great.
[11710.48 --> 11711.50]  I think it looks really good.
[11711.82 --> 11714.50]  I think the feedback that we got from the community was genuinely very helpful.
[11714.78 --> 11715.68]  So thank you for that.
[11715.84 --> 11717.84]  I genuinely, strongly appreciate it.
[11718.06 --> 11718.30]  Okay.
[11718.30 --> 11719.56]  This is just a link to LumaField.
[11720.10 --> 11721.56]  So it's not the thing we talked about yet?
[11721.58 --> 11722.32]  That thing is not...
[11722.32 --> 11723.12]  I don't think it's here yet.
[11723.18 --> 11723.38]  Okay.
[11723.58 --> 11725.00]  I'm not going to worry about that thing yet.
[11725.04 --> 11725.70]  So that's cool.
[11725.98 --> 11727.22]  We're not going to talk about the thing.
[11728.22 --> 11729.26]  It's the export design.
[11729.54 --> 11731.46]  Because we weren't sure about the whatever, whatever thing.
[11731.84 --> 11732.04]  Yep.
[11732.24 --> 11732.44]  Yep.
[11732.44 --> 11732.60]  Yep.
[11732.60 --> 11732.74]  Yep.
[11732.76 --> 11732.88]  Yep.
[11732.88 --> 11733.04]  Yep.
[11733.04 --> 11735.14]  Don't even worry.
[11735.26 --> 11735.82]  Don't even trip.
[11736.88 --> 11739.52]  Is there any other particular new thing that I should be showing people?
[11739.62 --> 11739.98]  Oh, wow.
[11739.98 --> 11741.32]  This is a ton of comparative data.
[11742.22 --> 11742.42]  Yeah.
[11742.50 --> 11743.20]  So that's pretty cool.
[11743.36 --> 11744.50]  Oh, is this highlight new?
[11745.04 --> 11745.24]  No.
[11745.56 --> 11746.00]  Oh, okay.
[11746.10 --> 11746.30]  Never mind.
[11746.34 --> 11746.70]  It's been there.
[11747.14 --> 11749.96]  In regards to things that are different.
[11750.02 --> 11751.22]  I mean, there is some stuff that are different.
[11751.34 --> 11755.02]  Like if before, if you loaded...
[11755.02 --> 11760.32]  If you selected dropdowns for something that didn't exist, it just wouldn't load anything.
[11760.32 --> 11762.06]  Now it communicates that we didn't test that.
[11762.06 --> 11762.92]  Oh, man.
[11762.92 --> 11763.52]  This is so cool.
[11763.60 --> 11766.54]  This like interactive chart thing.
[11766.78 --> 11769.80]  I really like just like playing with it.
[11771.24 --> 11772.96]  Matt did a fantastic job.
[11773.88 --> 11775.68]  It feels very nicely responsive.
[11776.76 --> 11776.92]  Yeah.
[11777.14 --> 11777.76]  It's great.
[11778.58 --> 11779.16]  It's great.
[11780.18 --> 11781.06]  Looks great.
[11781.58 --> 11782.56]  I notice you're in light mode.
[11786.50 --> 11787.86]  I can't address that.
[11788.52 --> 11788.84]  Yeah.
[11788.94 --> 11789.12]  Boom.
[11789.12 --> 11790.60]  Oh.
[11791.26 --> 11791.54]  Well.
[11792.16 --> 11792.68]  I don't know.
[11792.74 --> 11792.88]  Oh.
[11793.34 --> 11793.68]  Interesting.
[11793.98 --> 11795.18]  Well, that could maybe be fixed.
[11796.00 --> 11796.32]  What?
[11796.72 --> 11798.38]  Oh, it said I was in dark mode already.
[11798.96 --> 11800.60]  And then I clicked it and clicked dark mode.
[11800.60 --> 11800.76]  Oh, well.
[11801.08 --> 11801.34]  Nice.
[11801.34 --> 11801.68]  And then it...
[11801.68 --> 11801.82]  Yeah.
[11801.94 --> 11802.44]  That's fine.
[11802.66 --> 11802.94]  Nice.
[11803.26 --> 11803.38]  Yeah.
[11803.38 --> 11803.94]  Dark mode's pretty.
[11805.04 --> 11805.86]  Looks really good.
[11806.34 --> 11806.54]  Anyway.
[11806.54 --> 11808.78]  I always prefer dark mode, but I like dark mode on the lab site.
[11808.78 --> 11815.08]  So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I find coping mechanisms, find reasons to do
[11815.08 --> 11815.32]  it.
[11816.36 --> 11817.62]  The people are great.
[11817.84 --> 11821.12]  I legitimately like my colleagues, which helps a lot.
[11821.52 --> 11824.46]  I think if that wasn't true anymore, I would probably just quit.
[11824.66 --> 11824.84]  Yeah.
[11824.84 --> 11830.54]  Because that was a huge motivating factor for me to start the company was that I was tired
[11830.54 --> 11834.54]  of working with people that I didn't respect or didn't like.
[11834.54 --> 11840.34]  And for me, those are honestly, they're pretty hand in hand.
[11841.60 --> 11847.68]  I also didn't like explaining things that should be common sense to people who were in
[11847.68 --> 11854.68]  charge of what I was doing, especially when in many cases, and this is not true of every...
[11854.68 --> 11858.68]  I don't think I'm the smartest person in the world, but I think that we had some people
[11858.68 --> 11867.16]  in positions of authority who were especially not the best when it came to making decisions.
[11867.16 --> 11875.22]  And some of these differences in opinion don't just boil down to like, oh yeah, like I'm
[11875.22 --> 11876.32]  really smart and they're not smart.
[11876.36 --> 11881.86]  It's not that simple, but I just, I was tired of being the common sense police.
[11882.38 --> 11882.46]  Sure.
[11884.02 --> 11885.52]  I hope that answers your question.
[11885.62 --> 11885.92]  That does.
[11886.00 --> 11888.46]  Thank you for your time and good luck finding time for yourselves.
[11888.46 --> 11888.82]  All right.
[11888.88 --> 11890.46]  Now, thank you for your time.
[11890.56 --> 11892.60]  You came all the way out here and you're thanking me for my time.
[11892.70 --> 11893.34]  Appreciate you.
[11894.54 --> 11894.94]  All right.
[11896.16 --> 11897.32]  Next up, I guess.
[11897.66 --> 11898.52]  Yeah, do it.
[11898.54 --> 11898.90]  Come on in.
[11898.96 --> 11899.58]  Let's do it.
[11900.40 --> 11901.52]  Heyo, how you doing?
[11901.66 --> 11901.96]  Good.
[11902.08 --> 11902.22]  You?
[11902.62 --> 11902.98]  Excellent.
[11903.16 --> 11903.62]  Never better.
[11904.08 --> 11904.98]  Thank you for having me.
[11905.08 --> 11906.76]  I have a simple question, at least I think.
[11907.52 --> 11910.72]  Do you have any plans on expending on the hat line to include bucket hats?
[11911.68 --> 11912.38]  Bucket hats.
[11912.46 --> 11912.64]  Yeah.
[11913.28 --> 11913.66]  Wow.
[11914.16 --> 11914.56]  No.
[11914.88 --> 11917.06]  We have no plans for bucket hats.
[11917.06 --> 11920.92]  I think you're saying this like it's very out of the blue, but I think bucket hats
[11920.92 --> 11921.90]  are trendy right now.
[11922.20 --> 11922.52]  No.
[11922.62 --> 11922.74]  Yeah.
[11924.04 --> 11924.40]  Dude.
[11926.22 --> 11926.72]  Look at me.
[11926.72 --> 11927.38]  You would never know.
[11927.46 --> 11927.98]  Do I look trendy?
[11928.10 --> 11928.24]  Yeah.
[11928.38 --> 11929.32]  That's why I was letting you know.
[11929.32 --> 11930.44]  What would I know about trendy?
[11930.44 --> 11931.38]  That's why I was letting you know.
[11931.38 --> 11932.44]  What would you know about trendy?
[11933.52 --> 11934.46]  Not much more.
[11935.42 --> 11936.04]  If any.
[11936.46 --> 11939.10]  You could fit everything you know about trendy in a bucket hat.
[11939.66 --> 11939.98]  Probably.
[11939.98 --> 11943.88]  You know, you might actually know more than me because you talk to the people at Creative
[11943.88 --> 11945.34]  Warehouse more often.
[11946.96 --> 11947.74]  And they would know.
[11947.84 --> 11950.32]  They don't really try to pitch me things based on trendy, though.
[11950.44 --> 11951.58]  That's probably wise.
[11951.66 --> 11952.90]  They probably learned that over time.
[11953.02 --> 11953.52]  They did.
[11953.68 --> 11953.86]  Yeah.
[11953.98 --> 11954.16]  Yeah.
[11954.28 --> 11960.08]  They try to pitch me stuff based on like what they think our audience will like regardless
[11960.08 --> 11960.72]  of trend.
[11960.72 --> 11964.48]  And we do hop on trends a little bit.
[11965.02 --> 11971.58]  Like one of the trends that we've hopped on is that people need functional workware that
[11971.58 --> 11972.10]  is comfortable.
[11972.54 --> 11972.62]  Yeah.
[11972.72 --> 11976.78]  And we have like a lineup that essentially that we're building around that.
[11976.90 --> 11980.08]  Something that I appreciate a lot about the Creative Warehouse products in general is
[11980.08 --> 11981.48]  that it's not really.
[11981.58 --> 11984.72]  It's just good stuff that you'd like to have.
[11984.82 --> 11986.60]  We really need to stop using the word merge.
[11987.08 --> 11987.28]  Yeah.
[11987.28 --> 11992.80]  One of the one of the tour attendees actually brought that up during the tour today.
[11993.04 --> 11995.20]  And obviously they bought the 3D down jacket.
[11995.32 --> 11996.08]  That's why they're here.
[11996.18 --> 11997.40]  They won the contest.
[11997.54 --> 12002.00]  But they were like, yeah, no, I don't buy the stuff because like I like care especially
[12002.00 --> 12005.44]  about necessarily the channel or, you know, whatever.
[12005.58 --> 12007.62]  Like the design's cool, I guess, or whatever.
[12007.82 --> 12009.36]  But I buy it because it's really good.
[12009.44 --> 12012.08]  I'm like, yeah, that's exactly why you should buy something.
[12012.92 --> 12013.28]  I don't think.
[12013.32 --> 12013.92]  That's the actual goal.
[12013.92 --> 12017.48]  Have I ever asked someone to buy something from us because it's from us?
[12018.00 --> 12021.48]  Maybe, but not in a lot of years and not many times.
[12022.40 --> 12023.28]  I like this, Ashley.
[12023.38 --> 12023.52]  Sorry.
[12023.60 --> 12026.80]  Conrad is proposing instead of merch messages because we're trying to get away from merch
[12026.80 --> 12028.78]  that we call them good stuff messages.
[12029.72 --> 12030.82]  Good stuff messages.
[12030.98 --> 12033.14]  I mean, the branding probably needs a little bit of work.
[12033.52 --> 12034.68]  What do you call the bonus bin?
[12035.82 --> 12036.42]  Bonus bin.
[12036.50 --> 12037.36]  That's what it's called, isn't it?
[12037.40 --> 12038.24]  What does Luke call it?
[12038.24 --> 12040.46]  Oh, Luke's name for the bonus bin is terrible.
[12040.66 --> 12041.38]  It's not my name.
[12041.46 --> 12042.10]  It's Conrad's name.
[12042.14 --> 12043.18]  Well, it's terrible.
[12043.18 --> 12043.96]  I like that name.
[12044.02 --> 12044.40]  What is it?
[12044.62 --> 12045.06]  Come on, tell me.
[12045.12 --> 12047.64]  The Fuss, or the Free Upsell Shelf.
[12047.70 --> 12048.68]  It's not an upsell.
[12048.80 --> 12049.60]  It's free.
[12049.94 --> 12051.94]  You can't have a free upsell.
[12052.04 --> 12053.58]  That's not what an upsell is.
[12053.78 --> 12054.20]  Hey, man.
[12054.30 --> 12055.06]  I don't make the rules.
[12055.62 --> 12056.02]  It's great.
[12058.78 --> 12063.32]  Anywho, thank you for your message, or thing you said.
[12064.88 --> 12066.60]  I just love a good bucket hat.
[12066.98 --> 12067.58]  That's fair.
[12067.74 --> 12068.26]  That's fair.
[12068.36 --> 12068.98]  Yeah, it's a good one.
[12068.98 --> 12072.80]  If we made a bucket hat, it would be great, but we don't have any plans for a bucket hat
[12072.80 --> 12073.42]  right now.
[12073.94 --> 12074.50]  Thank you.
[12074.62 --> 12075.06]  Thank you.
[12075.64 --> 12076.36]  All right, Dan.
[12077.44 --> 12078.04]  All right.
[12078.24 --> 12079.16]  Oh, we got another one.
[12079.28 --> 12079.64]  Come on.
[12080.20 --> 12080.98]  Come on down.
[12081.14 --> 12081.38]  All right.
[12081.44 --> 12081.64]  Maybe.
[12081.64 --> 12086.82]  Maybe they're quality product questions instead of merch messages.
[12086.98 --> 12087.28]  I like that.
[12087.30 --> 12087.44]  Maybe.
[12087.96 --> 12089.88]  This one's probably pretty quick for you.
[12090.22 --> 12091.86]  I love my multi-nip shirt.
[12092.02 --> 12092.34]  Nice.
[12092.94 --> 12093.86]  Can I get one in pink?
[12095.08 --> 12095.38]  Oh.
[12096.42 --> 12099.70]  I think we actually did a prototype of that.
[12100.46 --> 12102.10]  When we did the...
[12102.10 --> 12103.92]  Oh, what did we ultimately release?
[12104.54 --> 12105.20]  Hold on a second.
[12105.36 --> 12105.86]  The gray one?
[12105.86 --> 12112.06]  Sometimes I can't remember the products that we work on versus the ones that actually make
[12112.06 --> 12112.60]  their way...
[12112.60 --> 12113.26]  Oh, man.
[12113.56 --> 12113.78]  Dude.
[12114.10 --> 12118.64]  I should have shown you guys the microfiber t-shirt when we were over there.
[12118.86 --> 12119.22]  What?
[12119.22 --> 12122.00]  We have a t-shirt in like...
[12122.00 --> 12125.76]  It's the yellow, like a microfiber cloth on the body.
[12126.44 --> 12130.70]  And then the sleeves are accented in that like soft, like baby blue.
[12130.82 --> 12131.32]  The blue, yeah.
[12131.68 --> 12136.36]  And it's like made of microfiber cloth.
[12136.64 --> 12138.56]  Like you would have the cleanest phone.
[12138.98 --> 12140.18]  You and all your friends.
[12140.18 --> 12141.82]  You'd have friends coming up behind you.
[12141.94 --> 12146.50]  They'd be rubbing their phone on you for good luck or good screen visibility.
[12146.86 --> 12147.48]  That'd be pretty funny.
[12147.48 --> 12147.54]  That'd be pretty funny.
[12147.56 --> 12148.84]  It's not very comfortable.
[12149.56 --> 12151.36]  But I think we're going to make it anyway.
[12151.60 --> 12154.08]  As someone with glasses, that's not a bad idea.
[12154.36 --> 12154.76]  Exactly.
[12154.88 --> 12155.66]  That's what I'm talking about.
[12155.66 --> 12160.30]  Anyway, the point is, I think we actually did prototype that at some point.
[12160.66 --> 12161.62]  Promotions with glasses stores.
[12161.82 --> 12165.92]  And I think we were worried that it would lack mainstream appeal.
[12166.08 --> 12167.12]  I was into it.
[12167.24 --> 12169.08]  We definitely did a blue one.
[12169.62 --> 12173.02]  I just can't remember if we ever did a...
[12173.02 --> 12177.08]  If we ever got past mock-up for a multinip shirt in pink.
[12177.18 --> 12178.68]  We released blue multinip?
[12179.14 --> 12180.20]  I don't think we released it.
[12180.38 --> 12182.90]  There was like a manufacturing issue.
[12182.90 --> 12185.08]  So they were sold for like 20 bucks or something.
[12185.08 --> 12185.92]  Or maybe even 10.
[12185.96 --> 12186.54]  Oh, there you go.
[12186.58 --> 12187.82]  I love that you know that.
[12188.00 --> 12188.64]  I have one.
[12188.74 --> 12190.36]  And I bought my mom one for her birthday.
[12190.62 --> 12191.52]  They're nice shirts, right?
[12191.68 --> 12192.24]  They're great.
[12192.40 --> 12195.54]  I wish it was more apparent what it looked like in a photograph.
[12195.70 --> 12196.02]  There you go.
[12196.04 --> 12197.08]  But they just...
[12197.08 --> 12199.70]  It doesn't look like that.
[12200.04 --> 12200.28]  Yeah.
[12200.36 --> 12201.60]  I mean, it looks kind of like that part.
[12201.66 --> 12203.14]  Now that we're zoomed in, it looks a bit better.
[12203.18 --> 12203.32]  Yeah.
[12204.08 --> 12204.72]  Basically, it's cool.
[12204.72 --> 12205.12]  It's more visible.
[12205.12 --> 12206.94]  It's cool and people love it.
[12207.00 --> 12208.12]  And we only have it in white and gray.
[12208.60 --> 12208.72]  Yeah.
[12210.28 --> 12212.70]  And this is such a good shirt.
[12215.90 --> 12220.24]  I just need enough to be a cartoon character and wear a different color of the exact same
[12220.24 --> 12221.42]  outfit every day of the week.
[12221.68 --> 12227.56]  I forget what the question was.
[12227.64 --> 12227.98]  Oh, yes.
[12228.00 --> 12228.64]  The pink multinip.
[12228.70 --> 12228.90]  Yeah.
[12228.90 --> 12229.26]  Sorry.
[12229.38 --> 12234.50]  I don't think there's any plans to expand the RGB shirt, which is what we call it now.
[12234.56 --> 12238.58]  I think originally we just called it multinip, which didn't mean a lot to a lot of people.
[12239.44 --> 12243.38]  I don't think there's any plans to expand the RGB shirt lineup right now.
[12243.66 --> 12244.72]  I could be mistaken, though.
[12244.76 --> 12245.34]  Like, maybe...
[12245.34 --> 12248.32]  Did we ever rerun those blue ones?
[12248.40 --> 12249.74]  Like, I can't even remember anymore.
[12250.26 --> 12251.54]  We have so many products now.
[12251.86 --> 12253.70]  Like, I can hardly keep track of everything on our store.
[12255.68 --> 12256.18]  All right.
[12256.90 --> 12258.24]  Okay, Dan, you want to hit us with another?
[12258.24 --> 12258.72]  Yes.
[12258.72 --> 12259.04]  Yes.
[12259.16 --> 12259.48]  Come on, Dan.
[12259.50 --> 12260.32]  Are we almost at the end?
[12260.44 --> 12261.22]  I think we've got two more.
[12261.96 --> 12262.32]  Fantastic.
[12263.42 --> 12264.56]  What can I do for you?
[12264.58 --> 12265.04]  That's all real questions.
[12265.18 --> 12269.72]  Okay, so the game industry, AAA Gaming, has recently produced a ton of flops.
[12269.90 --> 12275.06]  What do you think professional game studios are going to do to, like, combat this?
[12275.10 --> 12277.14]  Or are they just going to stay on the same path?
[12277.28 --> 12282.60]  They're going to wait for someone younger and hungrier and more innovative to make a cool
[12282.60 --> 12283.58]  game on their own.
[12283.68 --> 12285.10]  And then they're going to buy them.
[12285.16 --> 12286.82]  And then they're going to screw it up.
[12286.82 --> 12288.50]  And then they're going to rinse and repeat.
[12289.10 --> 12289.34]  Nice.
[12289.74 --> 12293.48]  So they're kind of going to stay on the same track, but just a slightly different room?
[12293.72 --> 12293.98]  Yeah.
[12294.12 --> 12298.48]  I think we might be witnessing somewhat of a turnover in companies.
[12298.82 --> 12301.64]  So, like, certain large companies that are starting to flounder.
[12301.64 --> 12306.70]  I think we're going to see offshoot companies, which there are a lot of examples of, starting
[12306.70 --> 12307.56]  to spawn up.
[12308.02 --> 12313.22]  And certain indie companies that are hitting very major success, potentially turning into
[12313.22 --> 12315.46]  the futures AAA companies.
[12315.68 --> 12319.52]  Certain offshoot companies forming out of these larger companies, potentially turning into
[12319.52 --> 12320.64]  the futures AAA companies.
[12321.00 --> 12322.66]  I think some companies are going to figure it out.
[12323.38 --> 12326.74]  I've noticed this is largely a North American game developer problem.
[12326.74 --> 12332.60]  Some examples from, like, Japan, for example, are not having the same type of hit.
[12333.18 --> 12339.24]  I do wish that I could agree that we're going to see these offshoots become the large companies,
[12339.24 --> 12341.16]  but I don't think they'll get a chance to get that big.
[12342.02 --> 12343.02]  Or they get gobbled again?
[12343.02 --> 12353.46]  Yeah, because the challenge is, unless your name is Larian Studios or Rockstar, I can't
[12353.46 --> 12357.46]  think of many game companies that can swing for the fences.
[12358.06 --> 12360.42]  Because remember, the question specifically was AAA gaming.
[12360.74 --> 12366.38]  I can't think of many companies that have managed this, like, Mark Rober, Mr. Beast approach
[12366.38 --> 12371.96]  to developing video games, where they swing for the fences, nail it on every release, and
[12371.96 --> 12377.10]  then can put their head down for three to six years and make the next absolute Grand
[12377.10 --> 12379.52]  Slam home run game that keeps the engine turning.
[12380.34 --> 12385.88]  So, at some point, when you grow big enough and you try to create AAA quality games, you
[12385.88 --> 12387.06]  collapse under your own weight.
[12387.54 --> 12392.68]  And companies like Microsoft and, to a lesser extent, you know, the EAs and UBs of the world
[12392.68 --> 12399.52]  are going to have this unlimited bucket of money that they can use to M&A you and bring
[12399.52 --> 12403.32]  your talented developers, ironically, some of which probably came from you in the first
[12403.32 --> 12410.12]  place, on board so that you can continue to do what you're doing, except probably with
[12410.12 --> 12411.86]  less passion and ultimately burn out.
[12412.04 --> 12415.30]  Like, it feels like it's in a really destructive cycle right now.
[12415.78 --> 12423.56]  And this ability of large organizations to just buy anything they want is not helping.
[12423.56 --> 12429.50]  I do agree, but I don't think everything is for sale now.
[12429.78 --> 12432.94]  Yes, this is because they're making those big hits.
[12433.62 --> 12440.08]  But I think we're seeing, like, there's quotes from the CEOs and other various people at companies
[12440.08 --> 12449.82]  like Larian and like Arrowhead that are very resistant to current AAA norms, if that makes
[12449.82 --> 12450.12]  sense.
[12450.48 --> 12452.32]  Like, on Arrowhead's website.
[12454.52 --> 12456.66]  This is so great.
[12457.96 --> 12461.08]  Fast Philly says, oh, I love it.
[12461.18 --> 12462.70]  I can't tell if this is self-aware or not.
[12463.36 --> 12470.82]  I think GTA 6 will be a technological marvel of gaming, but that at this point, there's
[12470.82 --> 12472.22]  no way it can live up to the hype.
[12477.56 --> 12478.38]  That's pretty good.
[12478.70 --> 12479.44]  I love it.
[12479.44 --> 12480.34]  The quote I was looking for.
[12480.36 --> 12481.14]  I hope it's self-aware.
[12481.42 --> 12483.04]  This is a quote on Arrowhead's website.
[12483.22 --> 12487.46]  I do not think most current AAA studios follow this type of mentality.
[12488.68 --> 12491.34]  But a game made for everyone is a game made for no one.
[12491.44 --> 12492.28]  That's Helldivers.
[12494.36 --> 12498.34]  Arrowhead clearly smashed it with Helldivers.
[12498.34 --> 12500.52]  And a lot of people really, really like that game.
[12500.80 --> 12505.16]  But they didn't design it for everyone in mind, right?
[12505.80 --> 12509.28]  And that's not really a mentality that you see a lot of these giant studios.
[12509.44 --> 12515.42]  Baldur's Gate was made for people, you know, that would really enjoy this type of thing.
[12516.22 --> 12520.52]  And it was just made so well that it hit a much more mass market.
[12520.84 --> 12522.32]  I think that's the same with Helldivers.
[12522.42 --> 12524.02]  I think that's the same with something like Elden Ring.
[12524.26 --> 12524.86]  Like, really?
[12524.86 --> 12531.38]  Looking at Elden Ring's success, would anyone have guessed that a game that hard would resonate so well with so many people?
[12531.76 --> 12532.16]  No.
[12532.26 --> 12534.88]  But it was a masterpiece of a game, so it did anyways.
[12534.88 --> 12539.60]  It's one message on Helldivers now.
[12540.42 --> 12541.06]  That's great.
[12542.02 --> 12542.78]  Yeah, I don't know.
[12543.40 --> 12547.20]  I was a little depresso about it, because I was like, games are dead.
[12547.42 --> 12548.70]  The whole industry is just dying.
[12549.04 --> 12553.86]  And then over the last few, the last couple maybe years, it's been looking a lot brighter.
[12554.76 --> 12556.34]  So, I'm not as worried about it anymore.
[12558.20 --> 12558.42]  Yeah.
[12560.94 --> 12569.66]  I think another big thing is that the community, as much as I doggone the gaming community for, like, buying too many microtransactions and stuff,
[12570.50 --> 12576.48]  but they seem to be much more willing to jump on and embrace games from non-AAA studios.
[12576.64 --> 12576.74]  Yeah.
[12576.86 --> 12578.60]  Fall Guys, Among Us.
[12578.60 --> 12579.22]  Fall Guys, Among Us.
[12579.70 --> 12582.42]  What is that game that looks like?
[12582.48 --> 12583.08]  Oh, Pal World.
[12583.30 --> 12583.42]  Yeah.
[12583.54 --> 12583.78]  Sure.
[12583.86 --> 12584.52]  Looks like Pokemon.
[12585.74 --> 12586.14]  Helldivers.
[12586.28 --> 12586.94]  Baldur's Gate 3.
[12587.20 --> 12588.80]  There's so many games that have smashed.
[12588.80 --> 12589.76]  Baldur's Gate 3 is AAA.
[12591.38 --> 12592.50]  I don't think technically.
[12592.88 --> 12593.22]  Is it?
[12593.42 --> 12593.92]  Maybe it is.
[12594.52 --> 12595.20]  I don't know.
[12595.90 --> 12597.14]  How many years did they work on it?
[12598.04 --> 12599.34]  Is that how you define AAA?
[12599.84 --> 12600.50]  I think AAA.
[12600.50 --> 12602.04]  I don't think you can call them a AAA studio.
[12602.04 --> 12602.44]  You know what?
[12602.56 --> 12604.78]  It depends, I guess, how you define AAA.
[12604.90 --> 12606.72]  I'm defining AAA in terms of scope.
[12607.64 --> 12608.58]  It's ambitious.
[12610.04 --> 12613.54]  Whether, because one person could conceivably build a game.
[12613.54 --> 12619.50]  Build a AAA quality game if they had 25 to 30 lifetimes to work on it or whatever.
[12619.50 --> 12622.70]  Like, to me, AAA is quality.
[12622.88 --> 12630.28]  But I could definitely understand if other people viewed it as more of like the dollars that were spent on it.
[12630.28 --> 12634.98]  But, I mean, in either case, Baldur's Gate 3, there's no way that that wasn't extremely expensive to create.
[12635.48 --> 12636.28]  Yeah, for sure.
[12636.54 --> 12638.94]  I just, how do you actually define AAA?
[12640.56 --> 12642.42]  Well, how do you define quadruple A?
[12642.48 --> 12642.64]  Okay.
[12642.94 --> 12645.88]  Baldur's Gate 3 had a budget of 100 million US dollars.
[12646.54 --> 12647.00]  Heck yeah.
[12648.62 --> 12649.38]  Is that accurate?
[12649.58 --> 12650.22]  Where'd you get that from?
[12651.14 --> 12652.32]  Uh, oh.
[12652.62 --> 12653.54]  That doesn't sound accurate.
[12653.62 --> 12654.60]  No, that's just a tweet.
[12654.90 --> 12655.12]  Yeah.
[12655.30 --> 12656.48]  I don't think that means anything.
[12657.70 --> 12658.26]  Hold on.
[12658.46 --> 12659.30]  Uh, hold on.
[12659.96 --> 12663.08]  This is from, oh no, this is just the forum on Larian Studios.
[12663.08 --> 12666.98]  Look, the point is, I believe that number.
[12667.42 --> 12668.78]  It's an enormous game.
[12668.88 --> 12669.82]  I don't.
[12670.12 --> 12670.44]  Really?
[12670.44 --> 12677.58]  And in talking to people that work there, a lot of people overestimate how much, how many resources they had going into it.
[12677.76 --> 12682.96]  A lot of people assumed that they received like a ton of money from Hasbro to make it when that was just not the case.
[12685.08 --> 12687.54]  It's, yeah, I don't know.
[12688.28 --> 12690.40]  It doesn't look like they've disclosed publicly.
[12690.66 --> 12691.34]  No, I don't think so.
[12691.34 --> 12694.12]  Because they are independent.
[12694.36 --> 12696.92]  I don't know if you want to call them an indie, but they are independent.
[12697.24 --> 12699.10]  Yeah, this Medium article just says.
[12699.10 --> 12704.86]  No one called them a AAA studio before reviews came in for BG3.
[12706.38 --> 12710.26]  No one was calling them a AAA studio when BG3 beta was public.
[12710.62 --> 12712.86]  No one was calling them a AAA studio at all these other times.
[12715.04 --> 12720.08]  But suddenly BG3 just smashes it out of the park and now they're called the AAA studio.
[12720.08 --> 12724.40]  Which, if that's how you become a AAA studio, then yeah, we saw it.
[12724.50 --> 12727.06]  We saw a developer go on the path that I'm talking about.
[12727.08 --> 12728.06]  Boy, was that ever a long path.
[12728.28 --> 12728.52]  Yeah.
[12729.28 --> 12730.10]  So, I don't know.
[12730.16 --> 12732.56]  Because they had been making a lot of games before BG3.
[12732.96 --> 12736.00]  A lot of people heard about them with BG3, but they've been making games forever.
[12736.26 --> 12737.22]  You want to know a fun one?
[12737.56 --> 12738.52]  Do you remember Magicka?
[12738.52 --> 12738.64]  Magicka?
[12740.28 --> 12741.26]  A weird game.
[12741.34 --> 12744.98]  You could do like, you played a little spellcaster, but a lot of inputs would do different things.
[12745.04 --> 12746.24]  And like, one of them was blue screen.
[12746.46 --> 12748.18]  Was the input that your character could do.
[12748.42 --> 12749.56]  Anyways, I used to play it back in the day.
[12749.60 --> 12752.56]  I'm sure you've, we've talked about it, and I'm sure you've played it at one point.
[12753.52 --> 12755.28]  But Arrowhead made Magicka.
[12755.84 --> 12758.80]  The guys that made Helldivers made Magicka.
[12758.88 --> 12759.86]  Which I thought was really cool.
[12761.12 --> 12762.14]  I'm pretty sure that's true.
[12762.30 --> 12763.40]  Let me verify this real quick.
[12763.40 --> 12768.00]  Yeah, Magicka.
[12768.68 --> 12769.42]  It's kind of neat.
[12769.72 --> 12771.04]  I swear I've never heard of this, Luke.
[12771.46 --> 12772.16]  I'm sure you have.
[12772.74 --> 12774.64]  I swear to you, I have never heard of this.
[12774.98 --> 12775.88]  Your memory is questionable.
[12776.26 --> 12776.86]  That's true.
[12777.38 --> 12779.32]  It's apparently from 13 years ago.
[12779.50 --> 12779.72]  Yeah.
[12780.32 --> 12783.98]  Or at least this video about it is from 13 years ago.
[12784.70 --> 12786.38]  Wow, four player adventure mode.
[12786.44 --> 12786.88]  That's cool.
[12787.30 --> 12787.54]  Yeah.
[12788.90 --> 12791.12]  And it's what, like an RPG or like?
[12793.40 --> 12795.58]  Uh, would that be the right way to call it?
[12795.70 --> 12796.82]  Maybe a dungeon crawler?
[12796.96 --> 12797.44]  Adventure game?
[12797.54 --> 12797.96]  Sure, yeah.
[12798.04 --> 12798.38]  Something like that.
[12798.38 --> 12799.54]  Recent reviews mixed.
[12799.96 --> 12802.06]  Yeah, I was, I wonder what that's about.
[12802.32 --> 12802.76]  I'm not sure.
[12804.56 --> 12807.98]  Crashes all the time when played online is the first negative review I found.
[12808.16 --> 12808.86]  Prone to crashing.
[12809.68 --> 12811.04]  It's a 13 year old game.
[12811.78 --> 12813.82]  Yeah, maybe it's not running well on modern systems anymore.
[12813.92 --> 12814.48]  Well, that's a bummer.
[12814.54 --> 12816.22]  Because all reviews is very positive.
[12816.62 --> 12816.88]  Yeah.
[12817.32 --> 12818.10]  Yeah, that's a bummer.
[12819.18 --> 12822.66]  This was a, this was an extremely positively looked at game at the time.
[12822.86 --> 12823.10]  Cool.
[12823.76 --> 12824.30]  All right.
[12824.40 --> 12825.94]  I think we're ready for our next one, Dan.
[12826.12 --> 12826.48]  Thank you.
[12826.56 --> 12827.10]  Thank you so much.
[12827.16 --> 12827.46]  Thank you.
[12827.60 --> 12828.06]  Thank you.
[12828.46 --> 12829.74]  I think your last one comes in.
[12829.76 --> 12830.12]  Last one.
[12830.78 --> 12831.20]  All right.
[12831.20 --> 12832.08]  Here we go.
[12833.10 --> 12834.50]  So vote for Magicka.
[12834.58 --> 12838.32]  It's like a great, like, single player together game to play.
[12838.86 --> 12841.92]  So not a real question here, necessarily.
[12842.22 --> 12843.06]  Dan might like it.
[12844.44 --> 12844.76]  UDO.
[12845.54 --> 12845.70]  Yes.
[12845.70 --> 12846.14]  LTT.
[12846.82 --> 12847.46]  Christmas album?
[12847.46 --> 12847.78]  No.
[12847.78 --> 12847.94]  No.
[12847.94 --> 12848.42]  Question mark.
[12848.42 --> 12848.84]  No.
[12850.24 --> 12850.76]  No.
[12850.98 --> 12851.52]  Wrong.
[12852.00 --> 12852.44]  No.
[12852.64 --> 12853.16]  And no.
[12853.88 --> 12854.78]  All of you know.
[12855.20 --> 12856.40]  Especially you know.
[12856.50 --> 12857.52]  You know why it's a no?
[12858.00 --> 12860.10]  Because we've got Dan and he could just make one in-house.
[12860.34 --> 12860.74]  Exactly.
[12861.02 --> 12861.34]  No, wait.
[12861.44 --> 12861.70]  No.
[12862.08 --> 12862.36]  No.
[12862.88 --> 12865.20]  You've got enough audio from Linus.
[12865.28 --> 12866.30]  You can just mix it up.
[12866.30 --> 12868.22]  You only need like a minute or two anyway.
[12869.28 --> 12870.28]  That is not the point.
[12871.00 --> 12872.34]  It's not about how much you need.
[12872.38 --> 12875.18]  It's about how much you should have.
[12875.24 --> 12876.38]  And the answer is none.
[12876.38 --> 12878.38]  I've got like 300 hours of like uncompressed.
[12878.38 --> 12879.00]  Uncompressed.
[12879.00 --> 12879.48]  Exactly.
[12879.70 --> 12880.78]  Single channel Linus.
[12880.88 --> 12881.08]  It's awful.
[12881.08 --> 12883.06]  You could have the whole album and just review it to him.
[12883.14 --> 12883.60]  Yeah, exactly.
[12884.66 --> 12889.02]  We could just play it constantly throughout his house and it would always be different.
[12889.26 --> 12890.48]  Oh, that'd be a fun channel.
[12890.54 --> 12890.94]  Super fun.
[12891.72 --> 12893.56]  Hijacking the audio in Linus' house.
[12893.56 --> 12898.26]  I think I'd figure it out.
[12898.26 --> 12898.46]  MKUltra.
[12898.72 --> 12899.40]  I think I'd figure it out.
[12899.40 --> 12900.32]  Floatplane exclusives.
[12901.78 --> 12902.56]  Oh, God.
[12903.32 --> 12908.06]  Speaking of floatplane exclusives, if you guys haven't checked them out, we've got a ton
[12908.06 --> 12909.22]  of really great ones.
[12909.66 --> 12914.00]  Our North Korean gaming console video is up in early access.
[12914.00 --> 12919.96]  We don't typically do early access necessarily on floatplane anymore, but hey, every once in
[12919.96 --> 12923.50]  a while, these videos do show up and this one is a doozy.
[12924.28 --> 12928.96]  We've also had a ton of great exclusive extended cut from the Ludwig collab.
[12929.68 --> 12938.90]  We've got the warning adult themes extras from the roasting Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace
[12938.90 --> 12939.86]  computer listings.
[12940.94 --> 12944.96]  This one was a little bit popular with the floatplane audience.
[12945.54 --> 12949.58]  Got that nice like-dislike ratio.
[12950.14 --> 12954.94]  And then from last week, the car break-in prank reveals what happened at the end of
[12954.94 --> 12955.62]  the Airpool Fools video.
[12955.70 --> 12958.36]  Man, we've had a ton of really good stuff lately.
[12959.04 --> 12963.44]  So make sure that you check it out over at lmg.gg slash floatplane.
[12964.74 --> 12965.26]  All right.
[12965.32 --> 12968.14]  I think that pretty much wraps up our in-person merch messages.
[12968.14 --> 12968.76]  So Dan.
[12968.92 --> 12969.48]  Oh, yeah.
[12969.60 --> 12969.74]  Okay.
[12969.84 --> 12970.06]  Never mind.
[12970.06 --> 12972.34]  So Dan, how do you want to handle this?
[12972.36 --> 12973.58]  Because we still have a couple topics.
[12973.84 --> 12976.32]  How much After Dark online merch messages there?
[12976.38 --> 12977.38]  What are we doing here?
[12978.42 --> 12979.18]  What's going on?
[12979.30 --> 12980.60]  I ask myself that a lot.
[12980.74 --> 12985.44]  I think maybe go do some topics and then if you want, you guys can move into After Dark
[12985.44 --> 12985.80]  yourself.
[12986.22 --> 12988.54]  You know what the light setting is.
[12988.66 --> 12989.52]  You know, we have the-
[12989.52 --> 12990.50]  Oh, you're leaving us.
[12990.76 --> 12992.38]  Well, we can either do some more topics.
[12992.72 --> 12993.18]  Oh, no, no.
[12993.28 --> 12993.52]  Okay.
[12993.58 --> 12996.98]  Or I can go like have more time to get set up if you're going to do some topics and then
[12996.98 --> 12998.28]  go directly into When After Dark.
[12998.28 --> 12998.32]  Right.
[12998.46 --> 13003.82]  So we're doing super checks, exclusively streaming on floatplane, Linus v. Luke.
[13003.90 --> 13006.84]  We're going to have a live audience, assuming they don't all go home because it's late.
[13007.14 --> 13008.32]  And I'm doing four cameras.
[13008.34 --> 13009.72]  I might need help from them this time.
[13009.74 --> 13010.52]  Four cameras.
[13010.62 --> 13011.30]  Four cameras.
[13011.36 --> 13013.02]  If I can get them working, one of them is freaking out.
[13013.12 --> 13014.32]  But four cameras.
[13014.86 --> 13019.46]  Do you maybe want to recruit your helpers to get Apple boxes to prop up the thing?
[13019.46 --> 13022.58]  Meant to ask, how many do you want and what are the sizes, etc.?
[13022.58 --> 13029.00]  Usually we use two full apples on the game and then I need two half apples to stand on
[13029.00 --> 13031.58]  because the game is too tall for me if it's Luke-sized.
[13032.72 --> 13033.72]  Most things are.
[13033.88 --> 13038.20]  It's funny because even if the score is in favor of me, he always wins because I end up
[13038.20 --> 13038.90]  emasculated.
[13039.00 --> 13039.74]  It is true.
[13042.48 --> 13043.58]  We both win.
[13043.64 --> 13044.04]  It's good.
[13045.38 --> 13047.30]  Unless I lose the game as well.
[13047.68 --> 13047.96]  Oh.
[13048.04 --> 13048.60]  That's fair.
[13048.60 --> 13048.96]  All right.
[13049.00 --> 13049.38]  I'm gone.
[13049.46 --> 13050.06]  That doesn't happen too long.
[13050.06 --> 13050.66]  See you later, Dan.
[13050.74 --> 13051.08]  Too bad.
[13051.20 --> 13052.80]  Xbox creates game preservation score?
[13052.80 --> 13053.46]  Yeah, let's do it.
[13053.50 --> 13054.08]  We've got to do this.
[13054.14 --> 13054.34]  What the hell?
[13054.42 --> 13055.54]  Xbox has created...
[13055.54 --> 13056.32]  Are you okay?
[13057.00 --> 13058.50]  The camera's following me.
[13059.62 --> 13061.26]  I forgot that it was magic.
[13061.48 --> 13062.98]  Oh, is that one of those...
[13062.98 --> 13064.14]  Yeah, it's got the facial tracker.
[13064.14 --> 13064.98]  ...Nexico ones or whatever?
[13065.10 --> 13065.86]  It's got the facial tracker.
[13065.86 --> 13066.50]  Who makes that one?
[13066.74 --> 13067.16]  I don't know.
[13068.54 --> 13069.42]  Isn't it on it?
[13069.84 --> 13070.90]  It's very...
[13070.90 --> 13071.12]  Not.
[13072.04 --> 13072.30]  Oh.
[13072.72 --> 13073.82]  I just want to look at you.
[13073.82 --> 13075.42]  You can't look at it closely without it.
[13075.90 --> 13076.38]  Like, yeah.
[13077.34 --> 13077.70]  Insta Link.
[13077.96 --> 13078.26]  Sorry.
[13078.40 --> 13079.14]  Insta 360.
[13079.62 --> 13080.54]  Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[13080.60 --> 13081.24]  Yeah, these things are cool.
[13081.32 --> 13082.00]  Wow, that's working great.
[13082.54 --> 13082.78]  Okay.
[13082.90 --> 13083.60]  What was I doing?
[13083.66 --> 13083.96]  Okay, goodbye.
[13085.02 --> 13090.44]  Anyways, Xbox has created a new team dedicated to game preservations, according to leaked emails
[13090.44 --> 13091.98]  from President Sarah Bond.
[13091.98 --> 13097.16]  Unlike many video game preservation efforts, which focus on old games from previous generations,
[13097.16 --> 13104.50]  this team is apparently focused on proactively preserving current games and ensuring backwards compatibility in future hardware.
[13104.94 --> 13105.86]  Actually, super cool.
[13106.00 --> 13106.58]  That's super cool.
[13106.68 --> 13111.62]  It's unclear how broad the team's scope will be, including whether it will cover online-only games
[13111.62 --> 13112.74]  that are dependent on servers.
[13113.26 --> 13119.26]  Sarah Bond likewise claimed in emails that Microsoft is moving full speed ahead on the next console generation.
[13120.34 --> 13120.92]  Discussion question.
[13120.92 --> 13126.04]  Is thinking ahead and demanding backwards compatibility the only way to ensure the survival of our favorite game?
[13126.10 --> 13127.08]  What an absolute Chad.
[13127.50 --> 13129.46]  I don't know Sarah Bond, but I like her already.
[13129.76 --> 13130.62]  Super, super cool.
[13130.80 --> 13132.88]  This is very, very important.
[13133.14 --> 13136.12]  No, it's not the only way to ensure the survival of games.
[13136.12 --> 13139.48]  But it's better than nothing, which is what we have right now.
[13139.58 --> 13145.28]  And I think taking a, you know, forward-thinking approach to it is just very wise.
[13146.62 --> 13149.54]  Because trying to do it after the fact can be really messy.
[13149.82 --> 13150.48]  It can be impossible.
[13150.82 --> 13151.28]  It can be impossible.
[13151.28 --> 13153.44]  In some cases, the source code's just lost and stuff.
[13153.54 --> 13154.48]  Assets are just lost.
[13154.52 --> 13154.92]  They're scattered.
[13155.44 --> 13157.02]  Yeah, it can be really wacky.
[13157.06 --> 13159.06]  So doing it up front is really good.
[13160.18 --> 13161.14]  What is this topic?
[13161.22 --> 13162.12]  Are we covering this topic?
[13162.74 --> 13164.10]  I mean, I thought it was pretty interesting.
[13164.10 --> 13166.04]  I don't know anything about it.
[13166.44 --> 13170.10]  AI doesn't understand interracial love.
[13171.08 --> 13173.36]  Okay, but this is meta-specific?
[13173.56 --> 13173.94]  Is that correct?
[13173.96 --> 13180.08]  Multiple AI image generators seem to struggle to understand prompts asking for mixed-race couples,
[13180.60 --> 13184.56]  especially Asian men with white women, according to a report by The Verge.
[13185.36 --> 13188.28]  This was first discovered with Instagram's image generator,
[13188.42 --> 13192.86]  which would almost always create two people of the same race when asked for an interracial couple.
[13192.86 --> 13198.32]  After this was widely reported, meta appears to have blocked prompts with keywords like Asian man,
[13198.68 --> 13201.62]  though this was quietly reversed after The Verge asked them about it.
[13202.48 --> 13206.68]  The Verge then replicated these results with Dolly 3 and Midjourney.
[13207.20 --> 13211.94]  For all three generators, it was possible to create an image of a white man with an Asian woman,
[13212.20 --> 13214.02]  or a black man with a white woman,
[13214.12 --> 13216.76]  though this was inconsistent and seemed to depend on the phrasing.
[13216.76 --> 13222.16]  Black man and white girlfriend wouldn't work, but white woman and black boyfriend would.
[13223.18 --> 13225.26]  When asked for an Asian man with a white wife,
[13225.46 --> 13230.58]  Dolly 3 and Midjourney repeatedly created an Asian man next to an Asian-featured woman with blonde hair
[13230.58 --> 13233.88]  and at least once a black man with a white woman in Asian-looking clothing.
[13233.88 --> 13238.98]  Verge's team was only able to get a straightforward image of an Asian man and white woman couple
[13238.98 --> 13239.90]  by using the prompt,
[13240.34 --> 13243.92]  Asian man and white woman standing in a yard academic setting.
[13244.58 --> 13246.88]  While The Verge attempted to test Gemini's image generator,
[13247.58 --> 13251.36]  Google still hasn't reinstated its ability to create images with human subjects,
[13251.72 --> 13257.96]  which was removed back in February following the racially diverse 1940s German soldiers episode,
[13258.08 --> 13259.92]  which we talked about on a previous WAN show.
[13259.92 --> 13261.94]  The feature was supposed to return in March,
[13262.04 --> 13263.78]  but it's still not available at this time.
[13263.84 --> 13265.14]  So we've got some images for this.
[13265.22 --> 13268.44]  This is absolutely mind-bending.
[13269.36 --> 13275.00]  So this is Asian man and Caucasian woman couple.
[13276.10 --> 13276.88]  Oh yeah.
[13277.90 --> 13279.78]  Asian man with Caucasian wife.
[13280.76 --> 13281.10]  Huh.
[13281.72 --> 13282.28]  Okay.
[13283.38 --> 13283.94]  Sure.
[13284.44 --> 13285.58]  What else we got here?
[13287.16 --> 13288.48]  I think these are...
[13288.48 --> 13289.58]  Asian woman with white husband.
[13289.92 --> 13290.86]  Uh-huh.
[13291.86 --> 13292.74]  Uh-huh.
[13293.36 --> 13296.56]  It seems to depend on phrasing and specific keywords.
[13297.66 --> 13299.10]  Because these were...
[13299.10 --> 13300.06]  You know.
[13301.54 --> 13302.30]  Interesting.
[13305.30 --> 13307.36]  Here's Dali in Midjourney.
[13307.62 --> 13309.78]  Fusing Asian slash white features.
[13311.10 --> 13311.78]  Interesting.
[13311.78 --> 13313.78]  Can you make me a photo of an Asian man and a white woman?
[13315.92 --> 13316.68]  Maybe.
[13316.86 --> 13317.30]  Kind of.
[13317.80 --> 13317.98]  Yeah.
[13317.98 --> 13318.38]  Sort of.
[13318.38 --> 13318.88]  Yeah.
[13319.92 --> 13320.92]  Uh...
[13320.92 --> 13322.86]  What are the prompts for this one?
[13323.30 --> 13325.08]  Because these look like it might have worked.
[13325.60 --> 13328.10]  For some reason, platonic seems to work fine.
[13328.34 --> 13328.96]  Check this out.
[13329.10 --> 13330.30]  And the keyword academic.
[13331.96 --> 13333.32]  This is weird.
[13334.12 --> 13335.18]  Isn't that weird?
[13335.28 --> 13335.98]  I wonder why.
[13335.98 --> 13338.60]  Well, I mean, it's how these things are trained.
[13338.70 --> 13345.12]  I mean, statistically speaking, it has no trouble generating the most common mixed race couples,
[13345.12 --> 13355.54]  but seems to just completely, completely fall on its face when trying to generate something that it hasn't seen.
[13355.54 --> 13364.58]  So, how would that explain the, whatever it was, black man with white girlfriend or white girlfriend with black boyfriend or whatever it was?
[13364.58 --> 13365.10]  So...
[13365.10 --> 13366.38]  Because that was just a wording reverse.
[13366.38 --> 13369.38]  It seems to me that instead of...
[13369.38 --> 13373.04]  And look, I don't work in AI development.
[13373.24 --> 13375.06]  I don't know how the black box works.
[13375.06 --> 13378.26]  All I can do is look at the output and take a guess as to what's inside it.
[13378.26 --> 13390.02]  It seems to me that they are somewhat, at least to a degree, dependent on the entire image of their sources, if that makes sense.
[13390.28 --> 13398.22]  As opposed to being able to use the entire image of a whole bunch of white women.
[13398.48 --> 13400.76]  So, you think that's why there would be feature blending as well?
[13400.92 --> 13402.54]  I think that's why there would be feature blending.
[13402.54 --> 13408.64]  I think that's why it would struggle to create an image that it doesn't have a full frame reference for.
[13408.82 --> 13411.84]  Yeah, that seems like that's something that's very solvable, to be honest.
[13412.10 --> 13412.72]  You would think!
[13412.74 --> 13413.86]  If that's the case...
[13413.86 --> 13418.04]  Well, I mean, it's honestly only been, like, a little while.
[13418.08 --> 13419.28]  I know, it's just...
[13419.28 --> 13421.30]  They're definitely going fast enough.
[13421.38 --> 13423.68]  I think the, you would think, is...
[13423.68 --> 13426.52]  We could leave them alone.
[13427.38 --> 13429.42]  AI is progressing quite quickly already.
[13429.42 --> 13432.82]  But, yeah, I don't know.
[13433.10 --> 13437.48]  It's an interesting problem, but I think it's definitely a solvable problem, which is good.
[13437.68 --> 13438.14]  Yeah, definitely.
[13438.14 --> 13438.84]  Because it doesn't seem...
[13438.84 --> 13441.32]  It's not like hallucinating fingers or doing anything like that.
[13441.42 --> 13441.92]  It's just...
[13441.92 --> 13443.04]  Well, I mean, I'm sure it also is.
[13443.42 --> 13445.18]  Actually, strategically...
[13445.18 --> 13445.64]  Check this out.
[13445.78 --> 13446.24]  This is great.
[13446.90 --> 13448.36]  All the hands are gone.
[13449.96 --> 13451.16]  I didn't think about that.
[13451.24 --> 13451.70]  That's funny.
[13452.00 --> 13452.36]  Hold on.
[13452.46 --> 13452.80]  There's one hand.
[13452.80 --> 13454.12]  Do any of these photos have hands?
[13454.26 --> 13454.60]  Yes.
[13456.38 --> 13458.28]  The meta AI ones.
[13458.28 --> 13460.58]  Yeah, that's not too bad.
[13464.44 --> 13465.30]  Yeah, anyway.
[13465.58 --> 13465.80]  Yep.
[13466.26 --> 13466.90]  I don't know.
[13467.02 --> 13469.42]  I just thought it was pretty funny because AI is funny.
[13470.08 --> 13470.22]  Yeah.
[13470.38 --> 13472.02]  Android AirTags are finally on their way.
[13472.42 --> 13476.22]  Google's rolling out a major update and expansion to the Find My Device network, which includes
[13476.22 --> 13479.94]  Bluetooth proximity tracking and compatibility with third-party Bluetooth trackers.
[13480.00 --> 13481.92]  So this is Android's answer to Apple's AirTags.
[13481.92 --> 13487.56]  It also has an unknown tracker alert feature, which tells users when a suspicious tracker
[13487.56 --> 13488.66]  appears to be following them.
[13489.18 --> 13492.46]  This update was supposed to come out last year, but was delayed by the effort to make
[13492.46 --> 13495.86]  the unknown tracker alert feature cross-compatible with Apple AirTags.
[13496.32 --> 13499.88]  Google apparently completed the work on their end in around a month, but Apple delayed at
[13499.88 --> 13503.96]  first waiting on a production implementation of the specification for unwanted tracking alerts,
[13503.96 --> 13505.90]  which became available in December of 2023.
[13505.90 --> 13510.46]  And then I guess they just took a while to get to it.
[13511.44 --> 13514.62]  The FCC is also rolling out broadband nutrition labels.
[13514.76 --> 13520.62]  This week, the broadband consumer labels rule came into effect, which require ISPs to prominently
[13520.62 --> 13525.08]  display standardized information labels designed to look like nutrition labels on food whenever
[13525.08 --> 13526.40]  a customer is signing up for a plan.
[13526.40 --> 13531.30]  And I actually think the design is phenomenally stupid, but the idea behind it that you can
[13531.30 --> 13535.52]  see what the name of the plan is, the length of the contract, the typical download and upload
[13535.52 --> 13540.88]  speeds, latency, and link to potential bundle and discount options is a really good thing.
[13541.34 --> 13547.86]  They must list the monthly price, whether that is an introductory rate, how long it will last,
[13547.86 --> 13550.32]  and any additional fees, whether one time or monthly.
[13550.74 --> 13554.36]  And they must include data caps and charges for exceeding them, as well as links to their network
[13554.36 --> 13556.36]  management and privacy policies.
[13556.36 --> 13557.68]  This is pretty cool.
[13558.48 --> 13565.76]  This is an example of good regulation, in my opinion.
[13565.88 --> 13569.50]  They're not actually making anybody do anything.
[13569.98 --> 13571.82]  This is very much open market.
[13572.64 --> 13577.44]  All they're requiring is that they communicate in a straightforward manner to potential customers
[13577.44 --> 13582.60]  so they can make an informed choice, which is how an open market needs to work.
[13582.60 --> 13584.50]  Very cool.
[13584.78 --> 13585.76]  And you know what else is cool?
[13585.84 --> 13586.56]  It's After Dark Time.
[13587.32 --> 13587.66]  Nice.
[13588.10 --> 13589.54]  So am I reading you things then?
[13589.68 --> 13590.00]  I don't know.
[13590.06 --> 13590.96]  You can read yourself things.
[13591.22 --> 13591.44]  Nope.
[13592.94 --> 13593.94]  I refuse, actually.
[13597.38 --> 13597.82]  Um...
[13597.82 --> 13599.22]  Wait a second.
[13600.90 --> 13602.96]  Would you just read out loud to yourself?
[13603.78 --> 13605.30]  You'd read out loud to someone else.
[13607.90 --> 13609.08]  I don't know where I'm going with this.
[13609.08 --> 13610.36]  Uh, anyways.
[13611.52 --> 13612.30]  Why can't I...
[13612.30 --> 13612.68]  There we go.
[13612.90 --> 13615.10]  Mr. Lafreniere, I read out loud to myself all the time.
[13615.18 --> 13615.38]  Oh!
[13615.70 --> 13619.00]  Oh, we didn't do the HP sued for alleged printer ink monopoly again.
[13619.14 --> 13620.88]  Well, I just broadcasted a merch message.
[13621.18 --> 13621.44]  So...
[13621.44 --> 13621.76]  All right.
[13621.98 --> 13622.54]  Well, then I will...
[13622.54 --> 13624.06]  Let's do this one and then go back to it.
[13624.08 --> 13624.16]  Nope.
[13624.16 --> 13626.32]  I'll mark this as something we'll touch on next week.
[13626.50 --> 13626.76]  All right.
[13626.78 --> 13627.24]  Sounds good.
[13627.90 --> 13628.84]  Hello, LLD.
[13629.12 --> 13631.98]  How can I get access to my family?
[13631.98 --> 13636.10]  How can I get across...
[13636.10 --> 13638.00]  Ooh, my brain is fun sometimes.
[13638.22 --> 13642.48]  How can I get across to my family the importance of cybersecurity and protecting their data on
[13642.48 --> 13642.98]  the internet?
[13644.18 --> 13645.54]  Who did the...
[13645.54 --> 13646.64]  I don't think you can.
[13649.26 --> 13650.16]  Can I say that word?
[13651.24 --> 13651.72]  I don't know.
[13652.72 --> 13656.88]  Some late night show comedian host guy.
[13657.08 --> 13657.46]  John Oliver?
[13657.70 --> 13658.46]  Yeah, maybe.
[13658.60 --> 13658.90]  I don't know.
[13658.90 --> 13660.24]  John Oliver is abrasive.
[13660.36 --> 13661.04]  It might not have been him.
[13661.04 --> 13662.62]  I think he's funny, but he's...
[13662.62 --> 13663.28]  I don't know who he was.
[13663.56 --> 13666.32]  He's a loud, assertive personality.
[13666.96 --> 13667.10]  Which one?
[13667.20 --> 13673.80]  Is he the one that got the 9-11 veterans their lung cancer or whatever it was money?
[13674.30 --> 13675.16]  Because if so, he's...
[13675.16 --> 13679.22]  It sounds like the kind of chatted out thing that John Oliver would do, but I'm not sure
[13679.22 --> 13679.84]  if that was him.
[13679.88 --> 13680.62]  Because that's pretty sick.
[13680.92 --> 13684.34]  One of those guys did a thing where to convince people...
[13684.34 --> 13685.30]  Apparently that was John Stewart.
[13686.14 --> 13686.76]  Okay, cool.
[13686.76 --> 13689.62]  Yeah, he only recently returned to TV, actually.
[13689.62 --> 13690.30]  He...
[13690.30 --> 13692.40]  Or to his show.
[13693.28 --> 13694.02]  Sorry, I'm listening.
[13694.46 --> 13696.00]  You've been fun to talk to tonight.
[13697.42 --> 13698.90]  I've been all over the place today, dude.
[13700.12 --> 13700.66]  I'm tired.
[13700.74 --> 13701.12]  It's Friday.
[13701.32 --> 13701.64]  It's okay.
[13702.36 --> 13704.08]  We played tape to tape pretty late.
[13705.10 --> 13705.90]  What was I going to say?
[13705.94 --> 13709.62]  Yeah, one of them did a thing where they were like, would you actually want...
[13710.16 --> 13711.34]  Man, what was it?
[13711.44 --> 13714.92]  It was something about data privacy and companies being able to see your files and stuff like
[13714.92 --> 13719.18]  that and it was like, do you want all your pictures of your thing being shared with companies?
[13719.72 --> 13721.20]  And it's the same kind of situation.
[13721.56 --> 13727.80]  Like maybe come up with something that would be horrible for them to lose or something that
[13727.80 --> 13730.88]  would be horrible for someone else to be able to have access to.
[13731.58 --> 13733.78]  And be like, is it worth risking this thing?
[13733.86 --> 13735.10]  Because this happens.
[13735.26 --> 13738.68]  And then give some examples of data loss that have happened.
[13738.88 --> 13740.10]  Because it's totally a thing.
[13740.10 --> 13745.40]  You can also put together practical demos, like generate a little, you know, generate
[13745.40 --> 13752.96]  a little clip of a political figure they admire doing something abhorrent and be like,
[13753.04 --> 13757.74]  hey, this is how easy it is to be fooled.
[13757.88 --> 13759.10]  You should really pay attention to...
[13759.10 --> 13760.74]  I don't think that's the question, but that is a very good idea.
[13760.74 --> 13761.98]  No, no, I was going somewhere with this.
[13762.06 --> 13762.22]  Okay.
[13762.50 --> 13767.72]  You need to pay careful attention to, you know, what the actual from field says in an email.
[13767.72 --> 13771.52]  Because there's a lot of really important...
[13772.64 --> 13774.80]  There's a lot of misinformation out there.
[13774.86 --> 13776.52]  And if you are not constantly vigilant...
[13777.12 --> 13781.98]  And the reason I brought this up is because my aunt actually showed me some of the emails
[13781.98 --> 13782.84]  that I sent her.
[13782.96 --> 13787.06]  That she's smart enough to not click anything in because they're suspicious, but she didn't
[13787.06 --> 13791.16]  understand how an email could say from Linus Sebastian and not be from me.
[13791.66 --> 13793.36]  Really good on her to not click that.
[13793.46 --> 13794.52]  That's actually huge.
[13794.52 --> 13798.24]  This is a huge problem that I see in Apple's default mail client.
[13798.82 --> 13802.78]  It doesn't show the email address by default, and it's not even obvious where to click.
[13802.86 --> 13803.68]  There's no hyperlink.
[13804.32 --> 13811.48]  You just have to touch the name and it expands and it shows it's from like xjfmb at some gibberish
[13811.48 --> 13812.60]  domain.com.
[13812.60 --> 13819.60]  And so just even the fact that it knows that sending her an email from Linus Sebastian makes
[13819.60 --> 13823.58]  her more likely to click on it is information that has been gathered about her.
[13823.78 --> 13832.72]  So the more you can do to put together practical demonstrations of how a lapse in cybersecurity,
[13832.90 --> 13836.64]  a lapse in vigilance can result in devastating consequences, I would say the better.
[13836.64 --> 13837.28]  Yeah.
[13837.28 --> 13837.38]  Yeah.
[13837.88 --> 13838.06]  Yeah.
[13838.12 --> 13838.48]  Good call.
[13839.20 --> 13843.70]  Chat says it was the John Oliver data broker story and it was incredible, says Matty L.
[13844.50 --> 13844.70]  Yeah.
[13844.72 --> 13846.82]  It's been a while, so I didn't remember, but yeah.
[13847.00 --> 13847.34]  Anyways.
[13848.50 --> 13849.30]  Next up.
[13850.06 --> 13851.30]  What did you guys look for?
[13851.66 --> 13852.04]  Oh, sorry.
[13852.24 --> 13856.14]  What did you guys look at when picking your shirt printer for the quality you were looking
[13856.14 --> 13856.42]  for?
[13856.84 --> 13861.22]  Want to get some images printed on the blank tees, but want to know what to look for?
[13861.22 --> 13866.70]  Um, so you're looking at the elasticity of the ink when it's dried.
[13866.90 --> 13872.94]  You want it to be thick enough that you don't really see the texture of the shirt too clearly,
[13872.94 --> 13877.26]  but you don't want it to be so thick that it'll be prone to cracking, uh, using high quality
[13877.26 --> 13877.78]  inks.
[13877.78 --> 13881.62]  Um, but that's something you're only going to know if you're talking to someone with experience.
[13882.16 --> 13883.90]  Um, how, yeah.
[13883.90 --> 13888.04]  How can you tell, like if you were picking a shirt printer, would they give you like sample
[13888.04 --> 13891.20]  shirts from, from like, cause this person, it sounds like they're going to be a
[13891.20 --> 13893.02]  very low run, maybe one or two.
[13893.10 --> 13893.66]  And that's tough.
[13893.74 --> 13895.82]  You just have to just have any on hand.
[13896.06 --> 13896.08]  Yeah.
[13896.08 --> 13896.64]  Previous work.
[13896.86 --> 13897.04]  Yeah.
[13897.06 --> 13897.26]  Okay.
[13897.32 --> 13899.78]  But that won't tell you how it's going to look after 10 or 20 washes.
[13900.00 --> 13901.54]  So your mileage may vary.
[13901.68 --> 13902.10]  That's fair.
[13902.28 --> 13902.52]  All right.
[13902.70 --> 13902.96]  Yeah.
[13903.60 --> 13904.00]  Okay.
[13907.00 --> 13911.92]  Hey, LLD, curious to know what you think about the freshwater situation in BC.
[13912.24 --> 13917.18]  I want to relocate there in the near future, but I'm worried about the potential COL crisis
[13917.18 --> 13919.10]  from drinking water to electricity.
[13919.40 --> 13919.64]  Yeah.
[13919.64 --> 13927.62]  Um, the lack of like glaciers anymore thing is going to be a big problem for Canada.
[13927.74 --> 13928.46]  Cost of living crisis.
[13928.62 --> 13931.26]  Like we can have, we can have all the water in the world.
[13931.72 --> 13936.42]  Um, but if we only have it for nine months out of the year, we're still all going to die
[13936.42 --> 13938.04]  in that three months that we don't have any water.
[13938.26 --> 13938.52]  Yeah.
[13938.66 --> 13939.14]  Kind of neat.
[13939.28 --> 13945.28]  And we don't have a lot of like BC lacks a lot of infrastructure to, um, I don't know
[13945.28 --> 13949.26]  what term you would use this artificially manually something to, to manage our water.
[13949.26 --> 13949.56]  Yeah.
[13949.82 --> 13952.24]  Because we're like, ah, I just have so much, it's just always there.
[13952.48 --> 13952.66]  Yeah.
[13952.70 --> 13953.50]  We don't need to do anything.
[13953.66 --> 13955.54]  And then suddenly it's not really there anymore.
[13955.54 --> 13960.24]  So we need to kind of retrofit our province to be able to retain water better, which is
[13960.24 --> 13961.04]  a little wacky.
[13961.44 --> 13965.26]  Um, but luckily there is a lot of tech already out there in regards to cost of living crisis.
[13966.48 --> 13968.72]  Um, maybe don't move to BC.
[13969.42 --> 13969.88]  Got him.
[13969.88 --> 13973.76]  Um, I don't know what to tell you, but it's just, I think you do know what to tell him.
[13973.84 --> 13974.54]  It's rough here.
[13974.64 --> 13975.40]  I think you just told him.
[13975.48 --> 13975.90]  That's fair.
[13976.26 --> 13976.60]  I did.
[13977.96 --> 13982.34]  Um, I mean, I'm not going to leave, but yeah, it can be challenging.
[13982.48 --> 13986.26]  If, if you, if there's some like great opportunity or something like obviously, yeah, come here.
[13986.26 --> 13991.10]  It's, it's, it's a great pace place to live in regards to like the nature that you're
[13991.10 --> 13995.54]  in and, and all that type of stuff, but it can get viciously expensive.
[13995.54 --> 13996.12]  This is great.
[13996.34 --> 13998.68]  Pit boy says, doesn't have anything to do with glaciers.
[13998.98 --> 14001.06]  Drinking water is snow on mountains.
[14001.06 --> 14002.26]  This year there wasn't much.
[14003.28 --> 14005.70]  Where do you think glaciers come from?
[14007.06 --> 14008.54]  From mummy and daddy glaciers?
[14010.12 --> 14010.58]  Sorry.
[14010.66 --> 14015.18]  I'm not, I'm not meaning, I'm not meaning to tease, but, um, snow pack becomes glaciers.
[14015.18 --> 14017.24]  Glaciers are started as snow.
[14017.68 --> 14019.18]  Um, so yes, they are.
[14019.26 --> 14021.46]  The things that you said are, are one in the same.
[14022.92 --> 14023.80]  Broadcasting again.
[14024.00 --> 14024.86]  What's up boys.
[14025.20 --> 14031.90]  Will there ever come a day when WAN show doesn't make sense to make weekly or say the CEO says
[14031.90 --> 14034.56]  no more WAN from a business, uh, standpoint?
[14036.96 --> 14037.44]  Hmm.
[14037.98 --> 14038.54]  No.
[14039.38 --> 14040.46]  WAN forever.
[14041.98 --> 14042.64]  Got him.
[14044.48 --> 14045.00]  Um.
[14046.18 --> 14046.68]  Next one.
[14046.74 --> 14049.92]  Hey DLL, what do you think about achievement hunting in games?
[14050.04 --> 14053.68]  Is it ridiculous to go back and do all the little things just to achieve 100% completion?
[14053.84 --> 14055.90]  Are you just trying to get different answers from the two of us?
[14055.94 --> 14058.44]  Because I think we feel very differently about this.
[14061.02 --> 14065.80]  I, uh, I don't get, I just don't get the dopamine hit from an achievement anymore.
[14066.80 --> 14067.84]  I just don't care.
[14067.84 --> 14077.48]  Um, for me, I, uh, I, I think it's, it's just that I, I no longer have the energy and attention
[14077.48 --> 14080.60]  to, to, to grind at something.
[14080.60 --> 14082.46]  If I'm not having fun, I will only.
[14082.92 --> 14083.22]  Yeah.
[14083.22 --> 14083.82]  Yeah.
[14083.82 --> 14083.88]  Yeah.
[14084.06 --> 14089.56]  I think for me, it's, it's like, I actually, I think I only have two games on Steam ever
[14089.56 --> 14093.24]  that I have a hundred percent completed, which I don't know if that'll surprise you or not.
[14094.06 --> 14094.76]  Assassin's Creed.
[14095.00 --> 14096.04]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[14096.46 --> 14097.24]  Black Flag.
[14099.02 --> 14099.36]  No.
[14099.36 --> 14100.30]  Wait, that's not on Steam.
[14100.64 --> 14101.08]  Yeah, no.
[14101.62 --> 14101.98]  Okay.
[14102.40 --> 14102.80]  FTL.
[14103.22 --> 14103.62]  Yeah.
[14104.32 --> 14104.84]  Is that one?
[14104.96 --> 14105.16]  Yeah.
[14105.24 --> 14105.44]  Yeah.
[14105.44 --> 14105.80]  Okay.
[14105.94 --> 14106.20]  Hold on.
[14106.22 --> 14106.94]  You should know the other one.
[14107.16 --> 14108.24]  I am thinking.
[14108.26 --> 14108.88]  You'll get it.
[14109.02 --> 14109.48]  I believe.
[14109.68 --> 14110.58]  I'm thinking.
[14110.78 --> 14111.40]  Slay the Spire.
[14111.52 --> 14111.68]  Yeah.
[14112.16 --> 14112.48]  Yes.
[14113.46 --> 14114.00]  Man, I'm kidding.
[14114.46 --> 14115.22]  And, uh.
[14115.24 --> 14118.62]  Is it, is it, like, is our relationship no fun anymore?
[14118.80 --> 14119.92]  Is there any mystery left?
[14120.92 --> 14122.06]  Now that we can just.
[14123.92 --> 14125.08]  I think it's still fun.
[14125.60 --> 14129.92]  Um, I, I think, I think we do sometimes need, like, outside things, though.
[14130.14 --> 14133.16]  We need, like, some new thing to talk about, because it's like, oh my goodness.
[14134.10 --> 14135.26]  There's, there's too much.
[14135.26 --> 14139.22]  I, I don't remember what it was the, um, what video was that?
[14139.32 --> 14141.02]  The guessing computer prices video?
[14141.80 --> 14142.02]  Yeah.
[14142.12 --> 14146.38]  There's a bunch of comments where it's like, Linus just, they just, like, know what the
[14146.38 --> 14147.42]  other one's doing all the time.
[14147.70 --> 14149.00]  Like, yeah, you get used to it.
[14149.34 --> 14149.54]  Um.
[14149.54 --> 14154.02]  The funny thing is we don't actually, we will sometimes go six months in a row without
[14154.02 --> 14155.72]  really interacting outside of WAN show.
[14156.28 --> 14157.12]  For real, though.
[14157.32 --> 14157.52]  Yeah.
[14157.74 --> 14162.06]  Very rarely that long, but regularly we will go a month without interacting outside of
[14162.06 --> 14162.44]  WAN show.
[14162.44 --> 14165.16]  And there have been periods where it was that long.
[14165.16 --> 14166.20]  Yeah, 100%.
[14166.20 --> 14166.84]  Yeah.
[14168.04 --> 14168.88]  I don't know.
[14169.28 --> 14170.30]  It's just a thing.
[14170.48 --> 14177.48]  But, um, yeah, I don't, for, for me, it's like, if I really like a game, but I'm starting
[14177.48 --> 14183.20]  to lose interest, but I, like, want to be interested in it still, it gives me another, it's like
[14183.20 --> 14184.80]  an alternative gameplay mechanic.
[14185.02 --> 14189.58]  But I almost feel like they've gotten too hard to account for the no-lifes that are going
[14189.58 --> 14190.12]  to do it anyway.
[14190.12 --> 14193.88]  Like, what, I'm going to go find every stupid Korok in Breath of the Wild?
[14193.88 --> 14196.08]  Like, I hate that type of stuff, though.
[14196.18 --> 14197.88]  Like, I just, I, no.
[14198.16 --> 14201.92]  Like, the Slay the Spire ones I liked a lot, and the FTL ones I liked a lot, because it
[14201.92 --> 14204.34]  made you play in, like, a weird way.
[14204.42 --> 14205.82]  Okay, like, are they skill-based?
[14205.82 --> 14206.76]  So you have to kind of figure out, kind of...
[14206.76 --> 14212.02]  Because it's just a tedious, walk the entire map, pixel by pixel grind.
[14212.82 --> 14215.54]  I just don't really, I don't really think...
[14215.54 --> 14215.74]  I'm not into that.
[14216.00 --> 14216.92]  I can do that.
[14217.48 --> 14220.68]  Assassin's Creed, I actually hate the achievements for Assassin's Creed, for the most part.
[14220.70 --> 14222.44]  You won 100% one of them.
[14224.46 --> 14231.00]  I 100%ed the synchronization, which was, like, basically perfect execution of every mission,
[14231.14 --> 14232.76]  which was not 100% of the achievements.
[14232.94 --> 14233.50]  Oh, okay.
[14233.54 --> 14238.54]  Because Assassin's Creed, like, Assassin's Creed 1 had horrible achievements that were based
[14238.54 --> 14241.64]  around, like, there's, I don't know, these, like, glowing feathers.
[14241.64 --> 14242.86]  There's, like, a thousand of them.
[14242.92 --> 14243.66]  Go find them all.
[14243.90 --> 14246.54]  It's like, dude, I don't care at all.
[14246.78 --> 14249.88]  This doesn't introduce a new way of playing the game.
[14249.98 --> 14252.00]  This doesn't change anything.
[14253.06 --> 14254.86]  It's just wander a lot.
[14255.66 --> 14255.82]  Yeah.
[14256.94 --> 14257.52]  I don't know.
[14257.56 --> 14258.76]  Like, there's other games to play.
[14258.82 --> 14263.16]  I think that's a big part of it, is now that there's other games to play, and so, so,
[14263.16 --> 14264.70]  so, so, so many.
[14265.80 --> 14270.26]  Wandering around, just for the sake of getting a little boop, boop, boop, you know, thing
[14270.26 --> 14271.46]  that pops up in the bottom of the screen.
[14271.46 --> 14272.10]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[14272.14 --> 14273.32]  I just can't be motivated for it.
[14273.52 --> 14277.60]  I did get a little bit more into achievements in general during a kind of lull there near
[14277.60 --> 14282.70]  the kind of beginning of COVID, mid-COVID area, where games were just trash, because
[14282.70 --> 14286.34]  I was like, well, I'm going to do something on my computer, so I guess this thing?
[14286.42 --> 14286.84]  I don't know.
[14286.90 --> 14287.56]  I'll go get that.
[14288.22 --> 14290.22]  But in general, I don't like playing that way.
[14291.78 --> 14292.62]  Okay, moving on.
[14292.62 --> 14301.54]  What was the worst slash most chaos-inducing deal Linus ever made during a WAN show?
[14302.30 --> 14304.52]  Oh, the one where I bought a bunch of GameStop.
[14306.76 --> 14307.44]  Yeah, okay.
[14307.52 --> 14307.86]  Good call.
[14307.94 --> 14308.18]  All right.
[14308.38 --> 14308.66]  Next.
[14308.66 --> 14309.60]  Hold on.
[14309.70 --> 14314.58]  And are there things he has been banned from offering, such as the time he gave in international
[14314.58 --> 14315.14]  free shipping?
[14320.82 --> 14322.00]  Banned from offering.
[14322.18 --> 14325.62]  I mean, I've been told not to leak products on WAN show anymore.
[14326.04 --> 14327.70]  I think that's fairly banned.
[14327.70 --> 14334.60]  Any Linus ban is a guideline more than anything anyways.
[14336.56 --> 14338.12]  It's daring me to do it again.
[14338.30 --> 14338.94]  Yeah, kind of.
[14339.30 --> 14339.98]  I don't know, man.
[14340.80 --> 14343.56]  Look, if I can't do this for fun, why would I even do this?
[14344.94 --> 14346.52]  Like, I've talked about this before.
[14346.62 --> 14347.64]  Like, I don't have to.
[14347.64 --> 14351.36]  So, like, let's have some fun.
[14351.94 --> 14354.46]  Tech is supposed to be fun.
[14354.60 --> 14356.48]  If it's not fun, then let's stop.
[14357.18 --> 14357.48]  You know?
[14357.60 --> 14358.42]  Like, no, man.
[14358.52 --> 14360.66]  Just, you know, we got to do our thing.
[14360.72 --> 14361.50]  We got to do things.
[14361.86 --> 14362.10]  Yeah.
[14362.22 --> 14363.76]  We'll play some super checks after this.
[14363.86 --> 14364.12]  Yeah.
[14364.26 --> 14364.94]  Yeah, let's do it.
[14364.98 --> 14365.86]  Dude, I'm going to have a hard time.
[14365.92 --> 14366.76]  I'm so sore.
[14367.70 --> 14369.80]  And I don't know what's going on.
[14369.94 --> 14370.18]  Let's go.
[14370.18 --> 14372.76]  I, like, thought this bottle was falling for a second.
[14372.86 --> 14373.82]  So, I went to go catch it.
[14373.82 --> 14374.02]  Nice.
[14374.02 --> 14374.86]  And it wasn't falling.
[14374.98 --> 14377.88]  And I'm having a really hard time with the dyslexia, with reading stuff.
[14378.08 --> 14378.84]  I think I might be tired.
[14378.94 --> 14379.08]  Yeah.
[14379.16 --> 14379.72]  How's being old?
[14379.72 --> 14382.12]  I think I'm buffering because I'm going to lose so bad.
[14382.20 --> 14384.48]  So, I'm trying to be like, ah, there's a lot of things going on.
[14384.50 --> 14384.62]  Yeah.
[14386.48 --> 14386.88]  I don't know if you're not made anymore.
[14387.06 --> 14388.14]  Yeah, it kind of sucks a lot.
[14388.16 --> 14388.72]  Yeah, I know, right?
[14389.56 --> 14390.38]  Hi, LLD.
[14390.56 --> 14395.66]  My recent project has me upgrade my, has had me upgrade my home server.
[14395.80 --> 14396.24]  There it goes.
[14396.58 --> 14402.72]  I was wondering why are the USB 3.2 Gen 2 adapters for 10 gig ethernet not ubiquitous?
[14402.72 --> 14407.44]  My motherboard has puny 1 gig card, which is my bottleneck now.
[14408.02 --> 14410.46]  Because, did you say 10 gig?
[14410.90 --> 14412.62]  10 gig chipsets are still expensive.
[14412.62 --> 14413.28]  Why is 10 gig not ubiquitous?
[14413.36 --> 14414.14]  Yeah, and it's cost.
[14414.14 --> 14422.54]  Yeah, because either you're going to have to have, okay, so you either have to have wider,
[14423.58 --> 14425.72]  you either have to have more lanes on the highway, right?
[14425.90 --> 14427.60]  So, then you would need more conductors.
[14427.82 --> 14429.48]  Or, you have to have faster signaling.
[14429.90 --> 14438.34]  And since we haven't changed the RJ45 connector in 30 years?
[14438.34 --> 14441.34]  I was going to say, I don't think I, like, have known of not existing.
[14441.56 --> 14443.64]  Yeah, I don't know how many years it's been.
[14444.30 --> 14445.84]  Then the signaling has to be faster.
[14445.94 --> 14451.80]  For the signaling to be faster, you're going to have to have more advanced transmission techniques.
[14451.80 --> 14454.64]  You're going to have to have faster decoding and encoding on both ends.
[14454.72 --> 14455.58]  It's just more complicated.
[14455.88 --> 14460.62]  And going from 10 megabit to 100 megabit to gigabit was pretty doable.
[14460.62 --> 14464.24]  Going from gigabit to 10 gigabit turns out it was really hard.
[14465.28 --> 14466.94]  They're getting a lot cheaper.
[14467.04 --> 14469.10]  They're getting way cheaper than they used to be.
[14469.16 --> 14475.50]  But it's not the kind of thing that most consumers are going to be expecting to pay extra for in a stupid little dongle.
[14475.58 --> 14477.46]  And it's not the kind of thing that most consumers need.
[14477.54 --> 14480.58]  If you're the kind of person who needs it, then you know you need it.
[14480.58 --> 14492.00]  And realistically, you need it for some kind of professional purpose, probably, because there's, to my knowledge, no reasonable average consumer application for 10 gig networking.
[14493.58 --> 14495.60]  You can make your NAS faster.
[14495.76 --> 14498.14]  That's about the only thing that really springs to mind.
[14498.70 --> 14500.42]  And even then, most things are going to do on that.
[14500.42 --> 14512.00]  And the only reason you would need it to be that fast, like need it to be that fast, is if you have astronomical amounts of data or if you're like video editing off of the NAS or something like that.
[14512.02 --> 14516.20]  And then we're kind of reaching the kind of prosumer professional level again here.
[14518.78 --> 14522.62]  Hey, I love your old t-shirts, but the new ones have really large neck openings.
[14522.62 --> 14524.56]  Is it just me or are they designed that way?
[14525.98 --> 14527.96]  I didn't know they had large neck openings.
[14527.98 --> 14528.70]  I didn't know that either.
[14528.70 --> 14532.10]  They seem like good sized neck openings to me.
[14532.10 --> 14532.64]  They seem the same to me.
[14533.00 --> 14533.80]  These aren't them.
[14534.06 --> 14535.18]  I checked my own real quick.
[14535.18 --> 14536.14]  I did too.
[14536.20 --> 14537.26]  I looked at myself in the picture.
[14539.22 --> 14540.04]  Yeah, I'm not sure.
[14542.38 --> 14547.38]  While XOC is mostly about the high score, have you seen it impact the development of new products?
[14547.52 --> 14553.34]  Is AMD slash Intel slash NVIDIA paying attention to the wild XOC achievements or is it too left field to matter?
[14555.54 --> 14556.44]  Not going to lie.
[14556.44 --> 14558.90]  XOC means what?
[14558.90 --> 14564.84]  So far we've got precision XOC, that EVGA overclocking software.
[14565.36 --> 14566.64]  XOC tequila grill.
[14567.42 --> 14571.80]  XOC lady XOC, a Maya Queen consort.
[14574.38 --> 14575.30]  XOC pharmaceuticals.
[14576.10 --> 14579.90]  I'm sorry, but I just actually have no idea what you're talking about right now.
[14579.90 --> 14582.86]  I'm terribly sorry and I will try better next time.
[14584.72 --> 14586.80]  If that's true, they probably don't care.
[14587.36 --> 14592.76]  If it's just a benchmark thing, it's probably not that big of a deal unless it's reported on really heavily.
[14593.34 --> 14595.10]  That's one way I would look at it.
[14595.10 --> 14598.64]  Or if it's reported on in very important arenas.
[14599.84 --> 14604.28]  Like if it's an enterprise thing, if some enterprise blog reports on it or something, it might be important.
[14606.16 --> 14607.08]  Howdy LLD.
[14607.26 --> 14613.70]  I'm an attorney and I've had experiences where opposing counsel can't even edit a PDF.
[14613.70 --> 14620.60]  I know your field is much more tech oriented, but what are some stories with some TEF deck people?
[14622.92 --> 14624.56]  Extreme overclocking, I guess.
[14624.80 --> 14625.26]  That's it.
[14625.76 --> 14626.06]  What?
[14626.26 --> 14627.94]  I've never seen extreme overclocking.
[14628.48 --> 14630.22]  Maybe I just ignored the acronym.
[14630.48 --> 14632.46]  Oh yeah, I've never seen it.
[14632.62 --> 14633.82]  Yeah, okay.
[14635.12 --> 14636.44]  I don't think they care.
[14636.54 --> 14637.26]  What was the question?
[14637.26 --> 14640.44]  Does this dictate design decisions?
[14640.62 --> 14641.00]  Oh no.
[14641.20 --> 14641.78]  Yeah, not at all.
[14641.92 --> 14642.54]  Heavens no.
[14642.88 --> 14648.28]  There's people at these companies that are super into it and love it and think it's super cool.
[14648.88 --> 14652.82]  And I think they live in the basement.
[14653.92 --> 14658.44]  And they do their science fair experiments there.
[14659.24 --> 14660.12]  And that's cool.
[14660.12 --> 14676.64]  And other than a like, you know, if one of the big wigs happens to be in the building and walks by and is like, that's probably about the most acknowledgement that they're going to get is the perception that I have.
[14676.70 --> 14679.62]  And I could be mistaken, but I know I really don't think they care.
[14680.90 --> 14681.30]  Yeah.
[14684.08 --> 14686.44]  Some tech deaf people.
[14686.80 --> 14687.22]  I don't know.
[14687.22 --> 14688.90]  In my life, it's usually fine.
[14690.12 --> 14691.52]  I mean.
[14691.74 --> 14694.26]  But I am surrounded by tech people in general.
[14694.56 --> 14697.54]  Yeah, I'm generally surrounded by tech people too.
[14701.36 --> 14704.78]  And maybe that's made me more patient in the workplace.
[14705.38 --> 14719.62]  Like there's no way that someone's going to be more of a challenge than, you know, the first time I tried to buy a computer for my grandpa and took it and like he couldn't wrap his head around horizontal movement translating to vertical movement on the screen.
[14719.62 --> 14719.92]  Whoa.
[14720.12 --> 14724.42]  I was just like, oh, so we're not going to exchange emails.
[14724.56 --> 14724.90]  All right.
[14725.94 --> 14726.32]  Yeah.
[14726.38 --> 14727.44]  There's a certain level.
[14729.68 --> 14730.30]  I don't know.
[14730.38 --> 14732.04]  I honestly don't have a very good example.
[14732.04 --> 14733.68]  I think most people have been very understanding.
[14733.68 --> 14739.34]  And if they are lacking some form of understanding, you can usually teach them fairly quickly and it's fine.
[14739.50 --> 14739.68]  Wow.
[14739.78 --> 14742.32]  Buddy Michael R bought two swipe plus bidets.
[14742.96 --> 14744.12]  Thousand dollar invoice.
[14744.38 --> 14745.16]  Getting his house out.
[14745.88 --> 14746.38]  Heck yeah.
[14746.38 --> 14753.20]  Luke mentioned some time ago that you use a knowledge base for float plane.
[14753.32 --> 14755.82]  What do you use as your knowledge base?
[14756.04 --> 14759.24]  Stack overflow team or confluence or just raw documents?
[14759.50 --> 14760.20]  None of the above.
[14760.30 --> 14761.06]  We use book stack.
[14763.16 --> 14763.68]  Slash.
[14763.68 --> 14765.54]  There's some stuff.
[14765.68 --> 14767.06]  You said float plane specifically.
[14767.22 --> 14768.48]  So I'm going to stick with book stack.
[14768.68 --> 14770.96]  But we use Peter.
[14771.12 --> 14771.58]  Hi, Peter.
[14772.38 --> 14775.64]  I was wondering why there wasn't a WAN VOD.
[14776.08 --> 14777.12]  That's kind of funny.
[14778.04 --> 14781.00]  This doesn't matter really to other people.
[14781.14 --> 14782.48]  But I don't know if you know this.
[14782.62 --> 14784.38]  We rolled out a new transcoding system.
[14785.00 --> 14786.12]  I did not know this.
[14786.22 --> 14786.46]  Yeah.
[14786.84 --> 14788.20]  It's probably good that you don't.
[14788.56 --> 14791.44]  Because that means it's not going as bad as it could have.
[14791.84 --> 14792.46]  Which is great.
[14793.00 --> 14793.74]  It's going pretty good.
[14794.10 --> 14795.02]  There's been some problems.
[14795.08 --> 14799.82]  But anytime you swap out a part of a system that's that big, there's going to be some problems.
[14799.88 --> 14800.96]  I think it's going great so far.
[14801.08 --> 14801.44]  Hi, Peter.
[14801.50 --> 14801.84]  How's it going?
[14804.88 --> 14805.44]  Anyways, yeah.
[14805.44 --> 14806.12]  We use book stack.
[14806.36 --> 14809.44]  A lot of the people use Google Docs.
[14809.50 --> 14809.94]  It's cool.
[14810.56 --> 14811.24]  That's about it.
[14811.50 --> 14811.76]  Thank you.
[14814.20 --> 14816.20]  Oh, one of them just moved.
[14816.32 --> 14817.08]  I don't know what happened.
[14817.78 --> 14821.32]  I don't know what one is displaying because it jumped right before I clicked the button.
[14821.32 --> 14822.18]  But hi, DLL.
[14822.36 --> 14824.68]  I've been watching since seventh grade 2012.
[14824.98 --> 14830.80]  As you've grown and hired a diverse team, what has been the biggest culture shock?
[14832.56 --> 14833.08]  Zoomers.
[14833.84 --> 14834.68]  Oh, okay.
[14834.68 --> 14836.10]  I actually don't really think so.
[14836.14 --> 14838.24]  I don't think there's been culture shock at all.
[14838.32 --> 14840.26]  Other than slang, right?
[14840.26 --> 14850.42]  Like, you know, what's funny is age is actually one of the ways that our company is the least diverse.
[14851.02 --> 14861.08]  Because if you look at all your sort of traditional ways that people are different or whatever, the kind of arbitrary lines that we draw.
[14861.08 --> 14864.64]  Our age spread is...
[14864.64 --> 14867.26]  We're becoming the old people of the company.
[14867.42 --> 14867.78]  Right?
[14868.50 --> 14873.48]  And even we are in our mid-30s still.
[14873.76 --> 14873.94]  Yeah.
[14873.94 --> 14876.12]  I still get to say mid at 37, I think.
[14877.86 --> 14878.22]  Borderline.
[14878.22 --> 14881.46]  I think that's allowable.
[14881.58 --> 14882.24]  But yeah, it's borderline.
[14882.34 --> 14883.10]  38, no.
[14883.36 --> 14885.00]  38 is late 30s.
[14885.10 --> 14885.32]  Almost.
[14885.56 --> 14886.38]  38 is almost 40.
[14886.42 --> 14886.68]  You know what?
[14886.68 --> 14887.44]  I'm probably late 30s.
[14887.44 --> 14888.46]  Let's go with late 30s.
[14888.56 --> 14890.24]  37, I think you could argue either way.
[14890.34 --> 14891.84]  Yeah, but my birthday is coming up.
[14891.84 --> 14893.92]  So I'm definitely late.
[14894.06 --> 14894.72]  I changed my mind.
[14896.64 --> 14900.06]  Yeah, so like I'm old at this company and...
[14905.06 --> 14908.94]  Everyone at this company either grew up connected, right?
[14909.00 --> 14912.22]  Because that's one of the big generational gaps, right?
[14912.90 --> 14915.06]  Either grew up connected or...
[14916.20 --> 14917.04]  Has worked in it.
[14917.08 --> 14920.18]  Or has worked in it extensively to the point where like...
[14920.18 --> 14923.50]  Like I'm thinking of someone like a Gary or someone like a Terran.
[14923.94 --> 14925.86]  These guys are lifelong gamers, right?
[14925.92 --> 14929.78]  Like they have been immersed in the culture for enough of their adult lives
[14929.78 --> 14931.82]  that functionally I don't really see them as really different.
[14931.82 --> 14934.14]  As far as I can tell, there's like basically no one on the planet
[14934.14 --> 14938.66]  that spends as much as their time doing like IT stuff as Sean does.
[14939.30 --> 14939.66]  Yeah.
[14940.28 --> 14942.18]  Like all these guys are just like...
[14944.00 --> 14944.18]  They're...
[14944.78 --> 14946.70]  You know, age is just a number.
[14947.62 --> 14948.80]  And it is.
[14948.80 --> 14951.60]  So like given that we tend to attract people
[14951.60 --> 14954.80]  who have this commonality of being into tech and into gaming...
[14956.60 --> 14959.72]  The whole like spending time doing it thing I think is a big deal
[14959.72 --> 14961.46]  because I find when you get older,
[14962.56 --> 14966.58]  you tend to do fewer different things.
[14967.56 --> 14970.34]  So like what your week might look like
[14970.34 --> 14975.02]  might be very similar to the previous week and the next week
[14975.02 --> 14977.00]  and you just do the same thing all the time.
[14977.08 --> 14980.00]  And that kind of results in it feel like time is going very quickly.
[14980.20 --> 14983.02]  And if you don't touch tech for, I don't know,
[14983.64 --> 14987.14]  like pushing bleeding edge tech for like six, seven years
[14987.14 --> 14988.68]  and then you're like,
[14988.72 --> 14990.40]  oh, I'm going to hobby get back into this.
[14990.62 --> 14992.30]  Yeah, it's probably going to be really weird.
[14992.82 --> 14993.72]  Things will have changed a lot.
[14993.78 --> 14995.06]  People are wearing goggles now.
[14995.14 --> 14996.18]  What the heck is going on?
[14996.22 --> 14996.60]  It's weird.
[14996.60 --> 14999.48]  But if you are in it every day,
[14999.56 --> 15000.46]  then whatever.
[15000.62 --> 15001.26]  It doesn't really matter.
[15004.42 --> 15006.18]  Anyways, archive that.
[15007.82 --> 15008.26]  Broadcast.
[15008.52 --> 15009.48]  WAN.dll.
[15009.66 --> 15010.14]  Great show.
[15010.30 --> 15013.28]  Curious about your thoughts on the YouTube UI change
[15013.28 --> 15016.54]  that shoves the description and comments into a tiny column
[15016.54 --> 15019.68]  and spams the rest of the page with endless video recommendations.
[15020.26 --> 15022.48]  Yeah, I've seen quite a few complaints about it.
[15022.54 --> 15025.62]  I haven't had it served to me yet.
[15025.80 --> 15027.88]  It doesn't surprise me that they're doing this.
[15028.04 --> 15030.00]  It's all about retention, retention, retention.
[15030.22 --> 15032.16]  And for some reason, retention doesn't mean,
[15032.22 --> 15035.12]  you know, making the comment section better
[15035.12 --> 15036.94]  and engaging that way.
[15037.00 --> 15039.18]  It means watch more video, watch more video,
[15039.28 --> 15039.90]  watch more video.
[15042.04 --> 15045.34]  I think that, you know, my opinion doesn't matter.
[15045.42 --> 15047.54]  If you don't like it, then you don't like it.
[15047.54 --> 15049.58]  I haven't tried to use it yet.
[15050.08 --> 15053.76]  As someone who tends to kind of ignore anything on a page
[15053.76 --> 15055.58]  that isn't the thing that I'm looking for,
[15055.64 --> 15057.20]  I probably won't notice it that much.
[15057.28 --> 15061.18]  But I don't necessarily agree with a lot of the things
[15061.18 --> 15062.72]  that YouTube is doing as a platform.
[15062.84 --> 15064.22]  I wish they'd kind of keep being YouTube,
[15064.34 --> 15065.86]  but maybe that's just me being a, you know,
[15065.94 --> 15068.50]  late 30-something fuddy-duddy at this point.
[15068.62 --> 15069.44]  I can't tell.
[15070.04 --> 15072.10]  I've been feeling actually very similar ways
[15072.10 --> 15073.46]  when looking at it about the like,
[15073.70 --> 15077.46]  am I the one who is wrong kind of situation?
[15077.78 --> 15078.58]  Because I look at it, I'm like,
[15078.62 --> 15080.30]  this looks messy and really chaotic.
[15080.30 --> 15084.08]  But then some people like watching a short
[15084.08 --> 15086.30]  that's split in half and there's content on one bit
[15086.30 --> 15087.42]  and a gameplay on the other bit.
[15087.46 --> 15090.48]  It's like, so maybe this is what the kids want.
[15090.56 --> 15091.56]  Maybe I'm the one who's wrong.
[15091.64 --> 15092.04]  I don't know.
[15092.38 --> 15092.82]  Nevermind.
[15092.96 --> 15093.14]  Nope.
[15093.20 --> 15093.98]  They're the one that's wrong.
[15094.08 --> 15094.46]  Screw off.
[15094.46 --> 15098.62]  Anyways, greetings DLL from the UK.
[15098.78 --> 15099.70]  Just catching up.
[15100.38 --> 15101.48]  I wait till he starts reading
[15101.48 --> 15102.72]  and then I curate another one.
[15102.88 --> 15103.78]  So cool.
[15104.14 --> 15105.24]  Just catching up here.
[15105.36 --> 15106.96]  I just tried PIA VPN.
[15107.40 --> 15110.06]  It cut my connection speed from 250 megabits per second
[15110.06 --> 15111.92]  to less than 70 megabits per second.
[15112.28 --> 15115.08]  Why does this happen and vary between VPN providers?
[15115.36 --> 15116.46]  Visiting Calgary soon.
[15116.46 --> 15120.56]  What you're doing is no longer going directly
[15120.56 --> 15122.02]  to the thing that you're doing it with.
[15122.08 --> 15123.10]  You're jumping through,
[15123.24 --> 15126.40]  you're hopping through a network of other servers.
[15126.92 --> 15128.58]  So depending on where you're hopping,
[15128.72 --> 15129.56]  it's going to affect it.
[15129.76 --> 15131.82]  You could try selecting different servers on there,
[15131.86 --> 15132.44]  see what happens.
[15132.52 --> 15135.04]  But using a VPN is generally not something
[15135.04 --> 15136.10]  that you do for speed.
[15136.32 --> 15137.14]  Yeah, it's not for performance.
[15137.14 --> 15139.72]  And don't forget that there's the encryption element as well.
[15139.78 --> 15140.98]  So you have to encrypt and decrypt.
[15140.98 --> 15141.46]  Yeah.
[15144.14 --> 15147.72]  Figures you'd be out of the bottle caps when mine breaks.
[15148.56 --> 15149.86]  Oh, that makes sense.
[15150.00 --> 15150.30]  Like these.
[15150.46 --> 15151.58]  Yeah, we do have a new one coming,
[15151.70 --> 15152.68]  but it's going to be a little bit.
[15153.08 --> 15154.50]  Are we restocking these at all?
[15155.06 --> 15156.12]  It's that but better.
[15157.16 --> 15158.70]  Oh, that's the new one that's coming?
[15158.84 --> 15159.58]  But you said it's going to be a bit.
[15159.74 --> 15161.48]  So like how long do you think we'll be out of stock of these?
[15162.00 --> 15162.42]  I don't know.
[15162.58 --> 15163.18]  Okay, got it.
[15163.30 --> 15164.28]  That's more of a net question.
[15164.40 --> 15165.20]  He's indisposed.
[15165.98 --> 15166.80]  Oh, yeah.
[15167.00 --> 15167.20]  Yeah.
[15167.44 --> 15168.22]  That makes sense.
[15168.22 --> 15172.34]  I'll settle for a gift for my wife and a question.
[15172.94 --> 15176.46]  What's your top three co-op games from childhood?
[15177.20 --> 15178.38]  Are they the same as today?
[15178.54 --> 15178.94]  Much love.
[15179.02 --> 15181.68]  Man, co-op was far less of a thing back then.
[15181.74 --> 15185.22]  I mean, a super cool one that existed during my childhood,
[15185.22 --> 15187.02]  but that I didn't play as a child.
[15187.14 --> 15188.76]  Child was Secret of Mana.
[15189.50 --> 15192.38]  Are you not including like teenager as childhood?
[15192.74 --> 15193.78]  Where does childhood end?
[15194.08 --> 15197.04]  I would say childhood ends at 11 or 12.
[15197.04 --> 15197.64]  11 or 12?
[15197.76 --> 15197.88]  Okay.
[15198.22 --> 15200.58]  Yeah, co-op.
[15200.74 --> 15202.12]  Lost Vikings for me.
[15202.42 --> 15202.68]  Okay.
[15202.78 --> 15203.58]  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[15203.78 --> 15204.00]  Yeah.
[15205.26 --> 15206.02]  Lost Vikings.
[15206.24 --> 15209.00]  And like it was kind of a weird form of co-op,
[15209.20 --> 15211.86]  but was it Super Mario Bros?
[15212.80 --> 15213.90]  You just kind of like took turns.
[15214.02 --> 15214.38]  Yeah, sure.
[15214.54 --> 15215.42]  Yeah, that's cool.
[15215.52 --> 15216.10]  It's technically co-op.
[15216.26 --> 15217.20]  Those would probably be my top two.
[15217.20 --> 15218.50]  I really enjoyed the first Trine.
[15218.62 --> 15220.90]  I was in my late teens.
[15221.14 --> 15222.92]  Like I was probably 19 when that came out.
[15223.04 --> 15223.64]  Ooh, maybe 20.
[15223.72 --> 15224.06]  I don't know.
[15224.46 --> 15225.64]  But Trine, super cool.
[15226.40 --> 15226.62]  Yeah.
[15226.62 --> 15228.58]  What else have we got?
[15231.24 --> 15233.44]  Man, there's a surprising number of merch messages today.
[15233.50 --> 15234.16]  What the heck happened?
[15234.22 --> 15235.78]  It was a pretty light merch message night,
[15235.86 --> 15238.08]  and then now it's like wild.
[15238.48 --> 15239.56]  That's when we start doing them.
[15240.08 --> 15244.82]  What games do you wish would be either completely reimagined or remastered?
[15244.82 --> 15248.16]  I'd love to see the Prince of Persia trilogy remade.
[15248.46 --> 15249.34]  I love Warrior Within.
[15249.62 --> 15250.38]  Thanks for the great merch.
[15250.38 --> 15258.30]  I want Freelancer.
[15259.66 --> 15260.10]  There.
[15261.38 --> 15262.44]  Freelancer is super cool.
[15262.58 --> 15262.80]  Ooh.
[15263.68 --> 15264.48]  Oh, man.
[15266.14 --> 15269.68]  That TIE Fighter, like, community rebuild thing was super cool.
[15269.74 --> 15270.70]  I didn't end up playing it, though.
[15270.76 --> 15271.94]  It was kind of...
[15271.94 --> 15275.22]  There were some things that were not working for me about it.
[15275.98 --> 15277.74]  Oh, that'd be super cool.
[15277.80 --> 15278.68]  I'd be super into that.
[15280.30 --> 15280.66]  Bull.
[15282.24 --> 15283.62]  Reimagined or remastered?
[15284.36 --> 15285.52]  I think back to anything.
[15285.70 --> 15290.28]  Like, the well's kind of been sucked dry for a lot of IPs.
[15290.28 --> 15292.50]  Like, if it had any merit whatsoever, it's...
[15292.50 --> 15293.28]  It's been addressed.
[15295.28 --> 15298.28]  Chrono Trigger is a good one from Kakaroto5045.
[15298.38 --> 15302.58]  Speaking of SNES RPGs, have you even touched Final Fantasy VI?
[15302.90 --> 15306.02]  Yes, but all of the gaming I've been doing lately is either with you
[15306.02 --> 15307.58]  or it's been making games, not playing them.
[15307.70 --> 15309.04]  But I've touched it a little bit.
[15309.12 --> 15309.54]  It works.
[15309.84 --> 15310.78]  My computer isn't crashed.
[15311.22 --> 15312.22]  I haven't gotten much further, though,
[15312.26 --> 15313.72]  because I'm trying to, like, remember where I was.
[15313.80 --> 15316.08]  So I loaded up and then just started, like, Googling things
[15316.08 --> 15317.72]  for where the heck I am and what I'm doing.
[15317.72 --> 15320.46]  But I'll play it this weekend for sure.
[15322.24 --> 15324.36]  For me, there's an obvious answer that you could guess.
[15324.46 --> 15326.08]  There's a less obvious answer because I was like,
[15326.10 --> 15327.56]  I've got to find something that isn't Morrowind.
[15328.78 --> 15332.62]  I don't want Morrowind reimagined at all.
[15333.42 --> 15336.50]  If they remastered it, I would hope that they just make it look better.
[15336.88 --> 15339.94]  Like the Super Mario RPG one where it's basically just,
[15340.32 --> 15341.88]  yeah, we, like, remade it but modern.
[15342.28 --> 15344.88]  Yeah, because I don't want them to have, like, a modern quest log.
[15344.88 --> 15347.14]  I want the journal to stay the journal.
[15347.14 --> 15348.10]  That would never happen.
[15348.88 --> 15349.20]  No, I know.
[15349.28 --> 15350.32]  So it's not going to be a thing.
[15350.72 --> 15351.94]  Another thing that won't be a thing,
[15352.06 --> 15353.72]  but a different answer that you might not expect,
[15354.08 --> 15355.24]  is Skull and Bumlins.
[15356.30 --> 15356.66]  Really?
[15356.90 --> 15357.88]  It just released.
[15358.06 --> 15359.14]  I don't want a remaster.
[15359.38 --> 15360.42]  I want a reimagined.
[15360.60 --> 15361.94]  You did the whole thing wrong.
[15362.22 --> 15364.68]  Just start over.
[15364.90 --> 15365.16]  Yeah.
[15365.64 --> 15367.06]  Trash the whole thing that you have
[15367.06 --> 15369.94]  and make the thing that the entire community asked you for
[15369.94 --> 15371.28]  the entire time.
[15371.40 --> 15373.24]  You pivoted, like, six times along the way.
[15373.46 --> 15374.48]  You never needed to.
[15374.48 --> 15376.28]  It was extremely well communicated,
[15376.40 --> 15377.32]  what everyone wanted,
[15377.42 --> 15378.48]  and then you didn't make that.
[15379.22 --> 15380.02]  You failed.
[15380.16 --> 15380.96]  Try again, please.
[15381.58 --> 15382.36]  I don't think they will.
[15382.70 --> 15384.80]  I don't think they're making any more quadruple-A games
[15384.80 --> 15387.20]  anytime soon, but, yeah.
[15389.26 --> 15390.26]  There's potentials.
[15390.26 --> 15391.22]  Are we looking through these?
[15391.94 --> 15392.64]  Aiden asked,
[15392.72 --> 15394.26]  are there some upcoming features or tools
[15394.26 --> 15395.66]  for your dev team that excite you?
[15397.12 --> 15399.68]  Does the new transcoding system count?
[15400.30 --> 15401.50]  That's very exciting to me.
[15401.50 --> 15402.46]  It's really cool.
[15402.62 --> 15403.62]  It's Kubernetes-based,
[15403.76 --> 15405.16]  so it's, like, in our whole thing,
[15405.84 --> 15407.66]  and it's nice and fast.
[15407.92 --> 15407.98]  Cool.
[15408.06 --> 15409.58]  It did the They're Just Movies podcast,
[15409.92 --> 15410.92]  which was really long,
[15411.24 --> 15411.90]  and it did it in, like,
[15411.92 --> 15413.06]  I think it was, like, half an hour or something.
[15413.12 --> 15413.46]  That's pretty good.
[15413.56 --> 15415.16]  And that's every version,
[15415.36 --> 15416.20]  so every resolution,
[15416.42 --> 15417.58]  that's the thumbnail thing,
[15417.64 --> 15418.56]  so you can scrub the video,
[15418.62 --> 15419.24]  all that type of stuff.
[15419.76 --> 15420.02]  Okay.
[15420.36 --> 15420.72]  It's cool.
[15421.28 --> 15421.82]  Torrent A,
[15422.02 --> 15424.84]  NVIDIA's new SDR to HDR conversion thing
[15424.84 --> 15425.50]  is pretty cool,
[15425.58 --> 15426.72]  but it only runs on PC,
[15427.24 --> 15428.96]  so I'd like to see...
[15428.96 --> 15430.96]  Oh, man, they want community-made-up mastering
[15430.96 --> 15432.70]  for SDR to HDR on a per-movie basis?
[15432.82 --> 15434.64]  I mean, that sounds super cool.
[15434.92 --> 15436.66]  I don't know if it's entirely realistic,
[15436.66 --> 15438.38]  but I could see something like that
[15438.38 --> 15440.36]  coming out in the future.
[15440.54 --> 15443.42]  It would be a colossal effort, though, I mean...
[15443.42 --> 15445.20]  But then there are things that have happened
[15445.20 --> 15446.34]  that I never thought were possible,
[15446.34 --> 15448.30]  like the way that you can just download subtitles
[15448.30 --> 15449.00]  for things,
[15449.26 --> 15451.38]  and they're just, like,
[15451.40 --> 15453.58]  there are, like, community open-source subtitles.
[15453.58 --> 15457.54]  That's another sort of incredible community effort
[15457.54 --> 15459.06]  that has taken place over the years
[15459.06 --> 15462.02]  that it's shocking to me sometimes
[15462.02 --> 15463.38]  how obscure a title can be
[15463.38 --> 15465.28]  and just how perfectly and flawlessly it works,
[15465.42 --> 15466.70]  so shout-out, you know,
[15466.74 --> 15469.56]  people for just being motivated motherfuckers.
[15472.48 --> 15474.04]  Anonymous is participating in
[15474.04 --> 15476.50]  a Skills Canada Provincial Robotics Competition
[15476.50 --> 15478.50]  at the Tradex in Abbotsford next Wednesday
[15478.50 --> 15480.88]  and says if anyone wants to come check it out,
[15480.92 --> 15481.64]  that'd be super cool,
[15481.72 --> 15482.62]  that would be super cool.
[15482.62 --> 15483.36]  So there you go.
[15483.42 --> 15484.94]  That's a thing that's happening next Wednesday.
[15485.26 --> 15485.48]  Nice.
[15486.72 --> 15487.46]  Anonymous says,
[15487.54 --> 15489.34]  hello, L2D2.
[15489.76 --> 15491.56]  What processes and tools do you use
[15491.56 --> 15492.96]  internally for product development?
[15493.40 --> 15494.34]  Safe, Jira?
[15494.82 --> 15495.76]  I'm a QA lead,
[15495.78 --> 15497.32]  and we often have to balance getting things done
[15497.32 --> 15499.34]  and having a robust company-wide process.
[15503.02 --> 15504.58]  Maybe a short answer for this one
[15504.58 --> 15505.86]  because we've got to get upstairs at some point.
[15505.88 --> 15507.32]  Yeah, I'm trying to think of a shorter answer.
[15507.74 --> 15509.18]  A lot of different teams around the company
[15509.18 --> 15510.02]  use their own things.
[15510.72 --> 15511.40]  I'll say that.
[15511.40 --> 15513.60]  Largely, it's not like super scrum,
[15513.68 --> 15515.38]  like individual small units of people
[15515.38 --> 15516.10]  use their own things,
[15516.20 --> 15517.32]  but it's usually like
[15517.32 --> 15519.80]  what I would define as a developmental unit
[15519.80 --> 15520.44]  within the company.
[15520.56 --> 15522.20]  So like Labs uses their own thing,
[15522.48 --> 15523.66]  Floatplane uses their own thing,
[15523.94 --> 15525.12]  Creative Warehouse uses their own thing,
[15525.46 --> 15526.70]  and it's good.
[15526.80 --> 15527.02]  It works.
[15528.60 --> 15529.74]  Okay, there's that one.
[15529.74 --> 15532.06]  I work for an LMS for online classes,
[15532.06 --> 15533.56]  and we're looking for a video streaming platform
[15533.56 --> 15534.58]  for our video content,
[15534.70 --> 15536.52]  preferably self-hosted, free open source,
[15536.76 --> 15539.62]  but what happened to Floatplane as a service?
[15539.62 --> 15543.14]  On the business side,
[15543.18 --> 15548.34]  we just haven't been motivated to develop and promote it
[15548.34 --> 15550.52]  and build a business case for it.
[15550.52 --> 15554.34]  I think this is a case of marketing and sales
[15554.34 --> 15555.20]  dropping the ball,
[15555.34 --> 15556.98]  and vision dropping the ball,
[15557.10 --> 15558.66]  and not the product not being good.
[15558.72 --> 15559.68]  The product is great.
[15559.96 --> 15561.02]  We just haven't done it.
[15561.02 --> 15562.18]  Floatplane as a service,
[15562.74 --> 15565.68]  partially, part of the code exists.
[15565.92 --> 15566.90]  We didn't delete it.
[15567.28 --> 15568.52]  We were working on it for a while.
[15568.94 --> 15570.54]  We just started prioritizing other things.
[15570.74 --> 15570.86]  Yeah.
[15572.94 --> 15575.86]  Just like we're prioritizing getting to the after party.
[15575.94 --> 15577.02]  You're going to play some super checks.
[15577.50 --> 15579.16]  We'll see you Floatplane peeps over there,
[15579.34 --> 15581.80]  and oh, how do we end the show?
[15582.04 --> 15582.98]  I don't know how to end the show.
[15584.38 --> 15585.66]  Oh, here comes Dan.
[15585.68 --> 15586.56]  I can hear him running.
[15587.40 --> 15589.16]  That was really funny, actually.
[15589.16 --> 15589.80]  That's hilarious.
[15589.82 --> 15590.66]  I don't know how to end the show.
[15591.70 --> 15594.96]  All right, well, we'll see you again next week.
[15594.96 --> 15596.24]  Same bad time,
[15596.62 --> 15598.16]  same bad channel.
[15598.76 --> 15599.68]  Someone in Floatplane chat said,
[15599.78 --> 15601.98]  I can tell it's late because Luke is speaking fast.
[15602.10 --> 15602.76]  Is that a thing?
[15604.82 --> 15605.68]  Well, you gotta say the thing.
[15605.80 --> 15606.12]  Bye.
[15618.12 --> 15619.72]  You did it.
[15622.72 --> 15624.02]  I got more.
[15624.96 --> 15628.30]  That's what you get for trying to improve your...
