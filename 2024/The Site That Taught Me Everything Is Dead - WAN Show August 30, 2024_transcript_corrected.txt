[0.64 → 8.46] What's up everybody and welcome to the WAN show. We've got a great show lined up for you this week, but it is a sad day.
[8.74 → 8.84] Yeah.
[9.20 → 21.10] Today we found out that Nantes has been shut down, and I don't know, I think it'd be kind of fun to, well, we'll do a quick rundown of exactly, you know, what went down.
[21.30 → 25.82] There's been some commentary from Dr. Ian Sutras who formerly worked there.
[26.24 → 34.46] And I think it'd be kind of cool for us to, you know, all kind of talk together about what that site meant to us and how it's impacted our journey in tech.
[34.54 → 41.42] Because it really, for those of you who are relatively new to the scene, it really was a big deal back in the day.
[42.82 → 44.24] Not so much these days.
[44.46 → 48.86] And I guess that's why it's dead.
[48.86 → 53.46] In other news, the Telegram CEO was arrested in France.
[54.24 → 55.72] This blew my mind.
[56.52 → 57.84] Absolutely blew my mind.
[57.90 → 58.82] We'll be talking about that.
[58.98 → 59.58] What else we got?
[60.56 → 66.12] We've got a fake person, a well-known activist that might apparently not even be real.
[66.54 → 71.40] Might seem like some pretty hedged wording here.
[71.40 → 72.48] It's like almost certainly not real.
[72.58 → 73.76] It looks bad.
[73.76 → 79.32] Speaking of hedged wording, a new version of Windows unlocks crazy Ry zen performance boost.
[79.84 → 80.18] Nice.
[80.68 → 82.04] Yeah, maybe they should have...
[82.04 → 83.06] Oh, wait, there's a blurb.
[83.16 → 84.80] Oh, I guess I do it after the intro.
[84.80 → 111.74] The show is brought to you by MSI, Ant lion Audio, Pulse way, our chair partner, Secret Lab,
[111.74 → 116.14] and our new laptop partner, LG.
[117.12 → 119.04] Always love me some LGs.
[119.08 → 120.84] And now Luke and I each have one.
[121.02 → 125.80] They sent over these new gram pros for us to use, and we finally have matching laptops.
[126.22 → 126.84] They're thin.
[127.18 → 130.16] They're super light, especially for being 17 inches.
[130.28 → 132.92] And they're packed with some pretty darn good specs, too.
[133.00 → 136.72] You can learn more about them at the link in the video description.
[137.44 → 139.78] Yep, we got some Mexican Gs right here.
[139.78 → 142.26] For LGs.
[145.32 → 150.24] Oh, by the way, I guess this is the part where I should probably do a framework sponsor disclosure.
[151.92 → 153.12] Hey, look, look.
[153.60 → 158.80] LG, the amount of conversations peoples have had about the laptops that we've used over the years,
[159.16 → 165.72] when they weren't sponsoring the placement, they can deal with this one being a little awkward to start.
[165.72 → 169.14] Don't worry, I'll do a really professional job the next time.
[171.26 → 171.70] Okay.
[171.80 → 174.70] Why don't we jump right into our headline topic today?
[174.88 → 177.56] Anand Tech has shut down.
[178.02 → 182.34] They've announced that the company will cease publication after 27 years.
[182.84 → 184.02] 27 years?
[184.40 → 185.10] Pretty crazy.
[185.10 → 186.80] I'm feeling old.
[187.00 → 188.44] That's a good reason to feel old.
[188.56 → 190.64] I didn't even think about that.
[190.64 → 192.42] I would not have thought it was 27 years old.
[192.42 → 198.50] That I started reading Anand Tech when it was pretty established, and it was 2003 or something.
[199.12 → 199.64] 2002?
[199.96 → 200.42] I don't know.
[200.52 → 204.44] Yeah, like 2002 was probably when I started avidly reading Anand Tech.
[204.44 → 209.58] The good news, there is a small silver lining here.
[210.34 → 218.14] The website will remain publicly available, and the Anand Tech forums will remain active, or at least as active as they are.
[218.14 → 218.58] For now.
[218.68 → 223.86] As far as I can tell, I saw a comment that there's no way to register on the site right now.
[224.24 → 227.60] I don't know if that applies to the forum, but comments under the articles.
[227.60 → 236.32] You apparently can't register, but people who have accounts can still comment, so we'll see how long that that keeps going.
[236.44 → 236.98] We'll see how long the forum lasts.
[237.96 → 238.90] Forums are tough.
[239.10 → 239.34] Yeah.
[239.44 → 241.42] It's a tough time to be a forum.
[241.72 → 247.82] Anyway, the site was founded by Anand Sh impi in 1997 when he was just 15 years old.
[248.22 → 253.50] It was purchased by Perch in late 2014 when Sh impi retired from journalism to join Apple.
[253.50 → 261.46] Then, in 2018, it was sold alongside other Perch-owned properties like Tom's Hardware to British publisher Future PLC.
[262.16 → 269.16] Former Anand Tech senior editor Dr. Ian Sutras has released a video on the closure in which he expressed that Anand Tech had been in decline for some time.
[269.60 → 270.94] It's an astute observation.
[271.52 → 280.62] We did need Dr. Sutras to come in and pull out his monos cope and have a look at it or whatever.
[280.62 → 284.56] I mean, that's absolutely the truth.
[287.28 → 290.52] Okay, we're going off script now.
[291.20 → 297.62] Anand Tech was seriously one of my half a dozen bookmarks in my browser.
[298.64 → 300.28] For me, it would have been...
[300.28 → 300.72] Oh, dude, Linus.
[300.96 → 301.12] Dude.
[301.12 → 312.10] When I first met Linus, if he wasn't working on a video for some reason or working at NCI or whatever, and sometimes even when he was, he usually had a non-tech opening.
[312.12 → 312.30] Yeah.
[312.64 → 313.68] Literally all the time.
[313.78 → 316.48] It was like my home away from home.
[316.60 → 317.56] Like, I had my email.
[318.12 → 321.18] I had NCI and the forum.
[321.18 → 326.78] I had separate bookmarks for each just in case I needed to shop really, really fast or go to the forum really, really fast.
[327.08 → 328.40] I had Extreme Systems.
[328.50 → 329.40] I had a non-tech.
[329.92 → 331.36] I had red flag deals.
[332.32 → 336.30] At some point when I was doing a lot of trading, I probably had, like, my heat wear in there.
[337.22 → 339.08] That was it.
[339.16 → 341.18] That was, like, my entire internet world.
[342.00 → 343.24] There were other sites that I read.
[343.24 → 344.10] I read Hard OCP.
[344.82 → 349.32] I would pop into Tom's hardware every once in a while.
[352.40 → 354.24] There's an extreme something.
[355.26 → 356.54] This is an interesting one.
[356.60 → 357.00] Guru 3D.
[357.16 → 358.00] I liked Guru 3D.
[358.44 → 360.28] This is an interesting one that I've been seeing a lot of.
[360.72 → 361.78] Phil H. in chat said,
[361.84 → 370.68] I'm amazed that Tom's hardware will have outlasted a non-tech as that place has been an ad-infested monstrosity for about a decade, but it somehow keeps going.
[371.88 → 372.90] That is how.
[373.24 → 384.92] Yeah, one of the things that Ryan Smith, who was the current editor-in-chief at a non-tech, said was that they were given the latitude to run the site the way that they wanted.
[385.04 → 397.72] I mean, I'm not sure that I entirely buy that because the non-tech that I used to read 10 years ago did not have nearly as much, like, clickbait garbage on it as the current version of the site.
[398.76 → 399.54] But they were.
[399.56 → 400.18] Yeah, but they might have been trying to.
[400.18 → 403.14] At least editorially, I think is what he was trying to say.
[403.24 → 406.14] But editorially, they were able to run the site the way that they wanted.
[406.92 → 424.54] And I guess that should give you guys some idea of how difficult it is to run a site that is not just churning out AI-generated or even just AI-assisted lists of products that the writer has never actually ever set their hands on.
[424.54 → 426.54] Let's see what else.
[426.54 → 428.88] Let's see what else.
[428.88 → 441.78] In Dr. Cutter's opinion, this was the result of the gradual attrition of key staff members who left as a non-tech's corporate owners pushed towards more commercial topics that they weren't interested in writing about.
[441.78 → 445.18] I suspect it's a little more complicated than that as well.
[445.18 → 448.86] But, I mean, I'm sure that he keeps in touch with folks there from time to time.
[449.36 → 456.64] What few new people were coming into the company weren't sufficient to replace those who left, leading to a negative feedback loop of declining capacity and scope.
[456.64 → 461.64] This then led to declining reinvestment on the part of a non-tech's owners and lower pay for freelancers.
[462.12 → 467.58] Cutter's also said that additional layers of management made communicating these issues upwards increasingly difficult.
[467.58 → 477.16] I can tell you as an outsider, the main issue for me was that I just wasn't really interested in what they were covering.
[477.92 → 485.76] And I don't know how much of this is topic choice and how much of this is how challenging the space has become.
[485.96 → 490.20] Like, there's not as much kitschy, interesting stuff these days.
[490.20 → 495.52] Like, I could see if I was shopping for an AIO cooler, like, this is fine, I guess.
[496.08 → 499.14] But, clearly, almost no one cared.
[500.08 → 501.68] But, like, what is this thing?
[502.52 → 508.52] The number of, like, random small form factor computers from brands that I've never heard of?
[508.52 → 515.24] I think that got the most comments outside the AMD Ryzen launch of anything that I'm seeing on the front page so far.
[515.34 → 516.80] Oh, no, you got to scroll down a bit, though.
[516.94 → 519.24] Like, what are all these coolers?
[519.24 → 522.58] Like, was that the only thing that they still had a test bench for?
[522.72 → 525.24] I mean, and it's not just recent.
[525.94 → 535.68] It's been for a very, very long time that I just haven't been able to get into the stuff that they've been reviewing.
[535.68 → 540.74] You can see, like, when there's something interesting to write about, they're still getting engagement.
[541.70 → 546.28] I mean, I'd be a little more interested in this than I think 16 comments merits.
[546.28 → 550.62] It's kind of cool, but it also kind of doesn't really matter.
[550.76 → 557.14] It's a power supply, and the things are on the edge, and it's going to probably be, like, kind of crayfish.
[557.28 → 558.84] It's probably not going to be the best one.
[558.84 → 565.46] Like, I guess there's just so many known quantities these days.
[566.26 → 571.42] This was another thing that I had noticed with a non-tech over the years was, like, Enema.
[572.18 → 573.06] Who cares?
[573.76 → 575.92] It's not 2003 anymore.
[575.92 → 585.46] Enema is such a small player in the enthusiast space these days in terms of how the average gamer might perceive them.
[585.52 → 586.82] They just haven't kept up.
[587.04 → 592.04] And to be clear, I'm not saying Enema is not a valid brand or that Enema makes a bad product.
[592.22 → 594.06] That absolutely is not what I'm saying.
[594.30 → 596.36] The brand doesn't carry a lot of clicks by its own.
[596.36 → 606.34] Compared to 2002, 2003, when it was Aztec, Enema, and irrelevant, right?
[606.66 → 613.36] Like, before OCT, like, stormed onto the scene, before power supplies were a twinkle in...
[613.92 → 615.00] Burned out?
[615.34 → 615.74] Sure.
[615.88 → 616.36] Fizzled out?
[616.36 → 624.84] Anyway, and before power supplies were a twinkle in Corsair's eye, Enema was hugely important.
[624.98 → 630.72] And it's like, why are you guys reviewing two Enema power supplies in a span of a month?
[631.72 → 638.20] So there were times when, you know, I wouldn't accuse a non-tech of, you know, pay-for-play.
[639.46 → 644.84] Especially because I read Ryan's article, and he said that they were left to their own devices editorially.
[644.84 → 646.64] But I would see stuff like this.
[646.72 → 652.64] What is the Gecko A7 mini PC, and how could I possibly care about this?
[652.72 → 658.36] How is that, how is that out of all the bazillion things that you could cover, the thing that you want to cover?
[658.46 → 660.40] I guess it's a pretty easy category to cover.
[660.80 → 662.64] Is it also, like, who they have?
[662.74 → 665.60] Like, someone likes doing those and specializes in those?
[665.70 → 667.38] So they're just, like, it's freelance writing?
[667.68 → 668.34] I don't know, man.
[668.34 → 676.98] Like, this is a tough one because, like, on the one hand, you know, I, okay, I hear something like that.
[677.02 → 680.38] And I go, well, management needs to manage that person.
[680.96 → 687.76] You know, they need to kind of work with them to develop an interest in something else.
[687.84 → 693.12] Something that is commercially viable.
[693.12 → 698.86] And in the case of a non-tech, I'm not even saying, like, hey, they should just do the most mainstream stuff.
[698.94 → 700.50] I mean, that's never what the site was.
[700.70 → 709.28] Commercially viable doesn't mean that it has to be what, you know, what Think Geek, or Think Geek, what was that?
[709.36 → 711.02] Life hacker, you know, like back in the day.
[711.36 → 713.26] You know, it doesn't have to be what Life hacker is doing.
[713.34 → 716.68] It doesn't have to be the most mainstream thing or The Verge or whatever else.
[716.68 → 726.54] It could be a deeper dive, but it just, it needs to be a deeper dive into not the I don't know.
[726.64 → 728.26] Here, I'm still scrolling here.
[728.36 → 731.34] So, I'm just going to, I'm going to go back to that last one that I was picking on.
[733.44 → 735.02] Whatever that weird thing was.
[735.02 → 738.82] Like, I think when I look at that writer, Ganesh TS.
[739.26 → 739.40] Yeah.
[739.66 → 742.20] When I look at that writer, it's a lot of these types of things.
[742.20 → 746.64] So, I feel like this might be a freelancer who's just interested in these types of things.
[746.72 → 749.28] I don't know if it's a management situation.
[749.52 → 764.02] But then the other side of it is like, as someone who works at a place, is it not worth considering if the work that you're doing is commercially viable and will continue to keep you gainfully employed?
[764.02 → 773.00] And maybe, maybe this is like old-fashioned or something, but when I was at NCI, I worried a lot about the value of the work that I was doing.
[773.52 → 775.00] Like, I know you're the same way.
[775.44 → 782.52] If it didn't feel valuable, not only did I not feel personally fulfilled by it, but I was stressed by it.
[782.64 → 789.40] Well, yeah, because you start to wonder, like, if the walls start to crumble, are you the easiest thing to drop?
[789.62 → 789.96] Yeah.
[790.50 → 790.90] Right?
[790.98 → 793.06] So, you question the value that you're bringing.
[793.06 → 799.28] You don't have to be the most valuable member of a team, but you never want to be an obvious place to cut.
[799.58 → 799.66] Yeah.
[800.76 → 802.12] And so, I don't know.
[802.20 → 813.06] I just, I look at a lot of the editorial decisions that were made in terms of what to cover and, you know, what was taking up space on the homepage.
[813.52 → 818.68] And I just, it doesn't, it doesn't surprise me that readership fell.
[819.04 → 821.04] Pete Kinetic says, if you're a freelancer, do you care?
[821.32 → 821.74] Yeah.
[821.74 → 822.14] Yeah.
[822.14 → 822.38] Yeah.
[822.38 → 824.06] Don't you like your freelance checks?
[824.58 → 825.54] Do you still have a job?
[825.54 → 826.36] Where do they come from?
[826.80 → 827.12] Yeah.
[828.40 → 828.76] Yeah.
[829.52 → 830.56] It still matters.
[831.68 → 833.38] And it's like your portfolio, right?
[833.60 → 838.66] Like, if my portfolio, and to be clear, I've never met, I've met Ryan.
[838.96 → 847.66] I haven't met, I don't think, certainly I haven't had a long conversation with anyone else on the who's on the non-tech team right now.
[847.66 → 848.38] It's super clear.
[848.46 → 850.44] I'm not saying it's this person's fault.
[850.44 → 850.68] Yeah.
[850.76 → 852.64] And it's nothing, it's absolutely nothing personal.
[852.64 → 859.34] But like, as a freelancer, wouldn't I want my portfolio to be something, someone that I send it to wants to read?
[859.34 → 859.78] Yeah.
[859.78 → 863.88] And it's possible this person did and might have wanted to do something else.
[863.88 → 869.52] And they had them on the team as a like mini PC person or something.
[869.66 → 870.40] And that's just what they want.
[870.48 → 870.60] Yeah.
[870.60 → 872.02] But then that's a management issue.
[872.16 → 872.80] I do agree.
[872.88 → 873.80] So that's what I'm saying.
[873.82 → 874.76] I'm not blaming anybody.
[874.76 → 883.52] I'm just saying, you know, as a team, you got to kind of, at some point, look at what you're doing and go, hey, is this valuable?
[883.82 → 886.36] Is this, is this moving the needle?
[886.78 → 886.98] Yeah.
[886.98 → 907.34] And I, you know, there's a lot to be said for, you know, the integrity of, you know, being interesting and passionate about something and, and single-mindedly pursuing that regardless of, you know, whether, whether your particular art, because I don't, I don't see writing a review as, as a, as a purely scientific endeavour.
[907.34 → 913.28] I think that there's an there's an art to making it engaging and making it accessible and making it interesting.
[913.28 → 916.30] I think as well, like looking at this, not going to lie.
[916.96 → 919.24] I think it's just, there isn't interesting things.
[919.72 → 921.86] Like they're releasing so many articles.
[923.38 → 923.86] Yeah.
[924.14 → 925.46] The stuff's just not there.
[925.92 → 926.20] Yeah.
[926.28 → 927.42] And like, I was, okay.
[927.44 → 929.30] Like there was some stuff that I was looking at.
[929.96 → 935.56] I hate to pick on Ganesh again, because it's like SSD reviews, like portable SSD reviews.
[935.78 → 937.20] And I'm like, really?
[937.20 → 944.04] But then SSD reviews were one of the things that Nantes really set themselves apart from.
[944.26 → 948.42] Like when I was learning how to test SSDs, I read a lot of Nantes articles.
[948.62 → 960.86] Anand's original review of the X25 series was what ultimately drove me to like get super into them and pay a bunch of money to get them for myself.
[960.86 → 965.04] Which is why I made videos.
[965.94 → 967.28] Is this going to be you're big?
[967.28 → 974.04] Like this, that I get, I got called out for SSD versus hard drives and like SSD buyers guides and stuff like this.
[974.30 → 975.60] Like you got called out for it?
[975.72 → 976.04] Yeah.
[976.18 → 982.48] Because back then people didn't get it because they thought that it was all about boot times.
[982.48 → 991.16] So that was why I, that was why I came up with this idea of putting together like a bunch of practical tests to show people that it wasn't just boot time.
[991.32 → 996.20] So I would do like application launches and game, game loading and stuff like that.
[996.20 → 998.00] And I did like a side by side drag race.
[1000.62 → 1006.80] Because a lot of the a lot of the marketing from the SSD makers and from the system makers was just boot times.
[1006.80 → 1007.98] And I was like, well, that's stupid.
[1008.08 → 1010.08] You don't, you don't boot up your computer very often.
[1010.08 → 1017.28] No wonder people think these things are stupid because you got to understand back then the price was so high for an SSD.
[1017.68 → 1023.38] And we were so used to waiting around for our hard drives that it, it felt like people called me chill.
[1023.52 → 1025.24] They called me ignorant.
[1025.48 → 1025.98] They called me whatever.
[1026.12 → 1028.86] They called me all kinds of things for saying, Hey, no SSDs.
[1028.86 → 1034.74] But it was actually like a non's coverage that, that got me really interested in them and got me really excited about them.
[1034.74 → 1047.16] I really think though that there's content on here that they're doing just because they need something to fill the pipeline.
[1047.40 → 1048.76] Like power supplies.
[1049.74 → 1050.94] There's a lot of them.
[1052.02 → 1055.86] They're not fascinating to all the viewers, but there's a ton of them.
[1055.86 → 1057.60] So they can fill the pipeline.
[1058.56 → 1058.92] Coolers.
[1059.00 → 1064.40] I don't think they're cooler reviews are getting a ton of traffic, but there's a ton of coolers.
[1064.62 → 1066.24] So you can make a lot of topics.
[1066.32 → 1067.02] Part of the issue.
[1067.20 → 1074.38] I haven't actually thought about a non-tech in so long because I just stopped reading because it got really boring.
[1074.38 → 1078.18] But part of the issue is that they're still doing a ancient school style of article.
[1078.64 → 1080.14] They're reviewing a cooler.
[1080.14 → 1083.04] You don't review a cooler anymore.
[1083.48 → 1088.56] You round up a bunch of price comparables, and they did round ups back in the day.
[1088.66 → 1092.14] But maybe the issue is that they just don't have the budget and time for it.
[1092.18 → 1092.30] Right.
[1092.32 → 1094.24] Like we don't, we don't know all the constraints.
[1094.56 → 1097.22] An interesting, let's just have a business meeting on the show.
[1097.56 → 1097.82] Oh.
[1099.12 → 1100.32] Why are we doing that then?
[1101.30 → 1106.86] So the idea is that, so to power supplies, like, are you talking power supplies specifically?
[1108.60 → 1109.00] Everything.
[1109.00 → 1109.14] Everything.
[1109.88 → 1111.04] So the idea.
[1111.04 → 1114.36] Right now, just for, because not a lot of people go to the website.
[1115.78 → 1119.10] Right now we have mice, keyboards, graphics cards, power supplies.
[1120.04 → 1125.98] So I think that we definitely need to figure out what our focus needs to be.
[1125.98 → 1133.92] But I can tell you that the reason that we started with power supplies was it's supposed to be something that we can automate to a significant degree.
[1133.92 → 1139.42] I don't know how deep you want to get into this business meeting.
[1139.56 → 1141.44] Oh, that.
[1142.34 → 1142.78] But.
[1143.68 → 1144.14] Sure.
[1144.40 → 1144.80] I don't know.
[1144.80 → 1155.80] But the representations to me about the degree to which they could be automated have been very different from how the situation actually is.
[1156.00 → 1156.46] Yeah.
[1156.46 → 1166.56] So, I mean, we haven't really talked about this much, but Luke is the interim head of the labs right now and has been doing a deep dive into how things are going over there.
[1167.24 → 1169.46] And why are we doing power supplies?
[1169.46 → 1172.22] Public service.
[1173.44 → 1175.08] Well, I need something that starts with a U.
[1175.38 → 1175.78] Undertaking.
[1176.42 → 1177.00] Oh, nice.
[1177.10 → 1177.32] Okay.
[1177.74 → 1179.00] That's the reason.
[1179.44 → 1181.78] I want to know which ones are bad, Luke.
[1182.00 → 1185.58] When we do a budget build guide, I want to know if it's going to blow up.
[1185.78 → 1186.00] Okay.
[1186.08 → 1187.82] Here's something you can't put a price tag on.
[1188.32 → 1189.54] We did a video recently.
[1189.86 → 1190.14] Okay.
[1190.32 → 1191.18] So, but the reason.
[1191.38 → 1191.80] No, no.
[1191.80 → 1192.10] Sorry.
[1192.44 → 1192.70] Go for it.
[1192.70 → 1192.88] Let me finish.
[1192.96 → 1193.38] Let me finish.
[1193.38 → 1198.00] We did a video recently where we bought systems from people on Facebook Marketplace.
[1198.24 → 1200.42] We bought three systems for $900.
[1201.08 → 1204.68] And in one of them, they used a Game Max power supply.
[1204.98 → 1210.18] Now, in the old days, I would have said, I've never really heard of these guys.
[1210.32 → 1212.08] They don't seem particularly reputable.
[1212.66 → 1218.84] But I have nothing to say, positive or negative, from my own personal experience about the quality of this unit.
[1218.84 → 1225.96] Thanks to LTT Labs, I was able to say, the Game Max products that we've tested have failed our testing.
[1226.76 → 1229.02] This is not a reputable brand.
[1229.48 → 1239.00] That knowledge has been now passed to the million and a half or so people, or 1.1 or 1.2 million people who watched that video.
[1239.00 → 1245.66] And we wouldn't have known unless Lucas did his fine work that he's doing.
[1245.76 → 1246.42] To be clear, not me.
[1246.84 → 1247.02] Yeah.
[1247.22 → 1247.42] Yeah.
[1247.48 → 1247.66] Luke.
[1247.78 → 1248.20] Oh, yeah.
[1248.24 → 1248.48] Sorry.
[1248.60 → 1249.02] Lucas.
[1249.72 → 1250.62] You win.
[1251.72 → 1252.80] The tall one.
[1253.18 → 1253.66] Yeah.
[1254.18 → 1254.54] Yeah.
[1254.70 → 1255.14] Very tall.
[1255.22 → 1255.58] Very smart.
[1255.66 → 1255.78] Yeah.
[1255.90 → 1256.90] Super cool guy.
[1257.02 → 1257.18] Yeah.
[1257.24 → 1261.94] If Lucas hadn't done his work, and I believe ONI did the write-up for that one.
[1262.06 → 1262.50] Yep.
[1262.50 → 1270.00] And if Sammy hadn't, you know, worked on how the visualizations for these things work, if those people hadn't done that work, we wouldn't know.
[1270.38 → 1272.44] Because who is out there testing this stuff?
[1272.48 → 1273.46] Because it's not profitable.
[1273.68 → 1274.00] Well, a non-tech.
[1275.38 → 1276.32] Well, they weren't.
[1276.40 → 1277.84] They didn't test any Game Max anything.
[1277.98 → 1280.28] They just test Thermal take and Enema for some reason.
[1280.84 → 1283.84] But here's, okay, here's a conflict of interest problem, though.
[1284.14 → 1284.78] Conflict of interest.
[1284.78 → 1288.34] Because we're just, we're continuing the business meeting.
[1288.34 → 1293.70] What about Linus's framework power supply investment?
[1294.46 → 1295.26] That's not what I meant.
[1295.68 → 1296.50] PSU linked.
[1296.64 → 1297.72] No, that's not what it's called.
[1297.90 → 1298.74] PSU circuit.
[1301.94 → 1302.46] All right.
[1302.54 → 1303.14] We're on your laptop.
[1303.28 → 1303.72] We're on your laptop.
[1303.94 → 1305.56] You're not in charge of labs now, are you?
[1308.20 → 1310.90] There's been conversations around this.
[1311.06 → 1313.06] Because this is PSU circuit, right?
[1313.72 → 1316.68] And some of these don't get very many views.
[1316.68 → 1323.46] And now it has been discussed that this is supposed to be just, like, again, a community service thing.
[1323.56 → 1324.06] So, okay.
[1324.42 → 1325.84] But it has also been stressed.
[1325.84 → 1326.08] Not community service.
[1326.34 → 1329.04] Neither of us has been convicted of a crime as yet.
[1329.18 → 1329.42] Oh.
[1329.58 → 1331.48] No, you can do, can you do that without?
[1331.66 → 1332.82] Well, I think that, I think.
[1333.02 → 1334.34] It would be called volunteering, I guess.
[1334.38 → 1334.68] Yeah.
[1334.84 → 1335.16] Okay.
[1335.48 → 1335.86] Fair enough.
[1335.92 → 1339.06] Yeah, I think the connotation of community service is that you had it coming.
[1339.32 → 1340.02] Yeah, fair enough.
[1340.10 → 1340.30] Okay.
[1340.72 → 1344.68] Because people have been pointing at things like the Sea sonic Focus GX750.
[1344.68 → 1348.34] And going, like, okay, this is not the launch.
[1348.50 → 1350.12] So, the launch one got 10k.
[1350.22 → 1350.34] Yeah.
[1350.34 → 1352.26] And then they got 2k after that for a little bit.
[1352.32 → 1353.26] And then they started faltering.
[1353.46 → 1353.56] Yeah.
[1353.56 → 1354.58] Sama, no one cared.
[1355.02 → 1356.10] I thought Sea sonic did pretty good.
[1356.30 → 1358.12] But this one, this one did pretty good.
[1358.20 → 1359.26] And then after that, blew.
[1359.78 → 1360.02] Yep.
[1361.10 → 1362.36] So, it's going to have to be a mix.
[1362.50 → 1367.96] It's going to have to be a mix of, basically, it needs to be a mix of the things people are buying.
[1368.30 → 1369.10] But then, like, this...
[1369.10 → 1370.16] And the things people shouldn't be buying.
[1370.22 → 1372.50] But this Sama one has gotten some flack.
[1372.92 → 1374.88] This is, again, this is internal business meeting.
[1375.02 → 1376.08] You guys are here as an accessory.
[1376.38 → 1376.52] Yeah.
[1376.78 → 1378.86] We thank you for being an audience.
[1379.02 → 1379.62] Thanks for attending.
[1379.98 → 1381.38] Yeah, this is actually really efficient.
[1381.38 → 1387.92] Because we're able to host a video while also having a conversation that we would have had to have anyway.
[1388.14 → 1388.34] Yeah.
[1388.62 → 1391.46] So, this one, there are a lot of reasons to test this one.
[1391.68 → 1393.38] One of them is that it's...
[1394.58 → 1400.22] The logo and stuff makes it really feel like it's a Sea sonic power spell.
[1400.64 → 1401.80] So, it's tricking some people.
[1402.46 → 1408.26] So, by getting the information out there, making it very searchable, all that type of stuff, we're still fitting that category.
[1408.26 → 1410.88] But then this is getting negative flack because it didn't perform very well.
[1410.88 → 1412.90] So, it's like we have to try to weigh...
[1412.90 → 1412.94] Wait, we're getting...
[1412.94 → 1414.82] Oh, are we getting flack because we covered it?
[1415.40 → 1416.74] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1417.56 → 1420.12] Oh, like internally people are questioning why we're bothering.
[1420.54 → 1421.52] Well, with the whole channel.
[1421.62 → 1423.14] But also specifically with that.
[1423.36 → 1424.68] It's going to have to be a mix.
[1425.28 → 1426.36] It's going to have to be a mix.
[1426.84 → 1427.22] We're going...
[1427.22 → 1428.30] But then we can't...
[1428.30 → 1428.50] Yeah.
[1428.62 → 1435.26] If it has to be a mix, then we can't stress the performance of the individual videos.
[1435.92 → 1437.62] And the performance of the individual pages.
[1438.54 → 1438.94] No.
[1440.22 → 1440.78] No what?
[1440.96 → 1441.66] No, we can't.
[1441.66 → 1441.88] Yeah.
[1442.20 → 1442.42] Yeah.
[1442.66 → 1442.94] Okay.
[1443.80 → 1444.30] All right.
[1444.44 → 1445.48] I mean, did I?
[1446.46 → 1447.06] I don't remember.
[1447.40 → 1447.64] Maybe.
[1447.80 → 1448.24] I don't think so.
[1448.24 → 1448.68] I've had a lot of talks.
[1449.50 → 1450.14] Probably not.
[1450.22 → 1450.52] I don't know.
[1450.60 → 1453.80] I think that the mix that we've had so far has been a little weird.
[1453.80 → 1457.66] Like the fact that almost every power supply has been 750 watt.
[1458.12 → 1458.74] Yeah, that's changing.
[1459.04 → 1459.24] Yeah.
[1459.50 → 1460.20] So, like...
[1460.20 → 1462.12] I will also credit that...
[1462.12 → 1462.26] Yeah.
[1462.26 → 1465.58] I mean, it started changing before I came in.
[1465.66 → 1466.08] Yeah, yeah.
[1466.08 → 1466.16] Yeah, yeah.
[1466.16 → 1466.74] That's fine.
[1466.96 → 1467.66] That's not a mean...
[1467.66 → 1472.76] I just mean, there's definitely some stuff that we've got to do to optimize the mix here.
[1472.76 → 1479.76] Um, there should definitely be more, you know, your Corsair, your Sea sonic, your reputable brands.
[1479.76 → 1483.82] Um, I would like to really focus on the stuff that people are buying.
[1484.26 → 1491.76] Like, the fact that we don't have, like, a Thermal take Smart 430 watt in there is, in my opinion...
[1492.34 → 1495.88] And, look, I, you know, I haven't been hand-holding this.
[1496.08 → 1500.10] Um, so I haven't necessarily given this feedback before.
[1500.24 → 1502.66] So, my apologies if this is a surprise to anybody.
[1502.66 → 1507.52] But the fact that we don't have, like, a 430 watt Thermal take in there is a huge miss to me.
[1507.52 → 1512.40] Because the number of people that are buying these things is enormous.
[1512.70 → 1515.70] And we can see that in the reviews on sites like New egg and Amazon.
[1516.18 → 1524.52] And what I want to know, as someone who is, you know, in charge of recommending products to people, is...
[1525.30 → 1527.12] Okay, but how bad is it?
[1527.50 → 1527.72] Yeah.
[1527.96 → 1529.68] Is it that bad?
[1530.30 → 1534.54] Like, is it, is it, is it bad, like, it's going to fail?
[1534.64 → 1536.08] Is it break your system in a year?
[1536.08 → 1540.74] Is it, is it bad, like, when it fails, it could light on fire?
[1540.96 → 1542.56] I need to know this stuff.
[1543.10 → 1550.76] And so, power supplies, I'd say, is probably the vertical that we are closest to.
[1550.90 → 1553.82] In terms of the vision for how the lab is supposed to function.
[1554.24 → 1560.38] And I have actually, repeatedly, talked about PSU Circuit as something that I consider to be a win.
[1560.38 → 1562.14] Yes, I know that.
[1562.32 → 1562.84] This is...
[1562.84 → 1565.68] I've been trying to explain to people why that's true.
[1566.54 → 1568.86] Because this is what we are trying to do.
[1569.04 → 1571.86] And it's going to take a long time for people to...
[1571.86 → 1581.20] This is something that's really important to slam home for people because of a conversation that we had during this topic a little bit earlier.
[1581.60 → 1587.72] We were talking about how people don't necessarily want to work on things that don't, like, do well.
[1587.72 → 1594.04] So, it's really important to communicate to a team that, like, you know, the web articles are getting tons of views.
[1594.04 → 1594.64] Because...
[1594.64 → 1600.56] We impacted, literally, even if we account for that, people don't watch the entire video.
[1600.84 → 1608.58] We impacted hundreds of thousands of people and made them aware that this brand is sketchy.
[1608.94 → 1610.66] They wouldn't have known otherwise.
[1610.90 → 1612.28] Because no one's covering this stuff.
[1612.30 → 1613.52] So, that was included in an LTT video?
[1613.52 → 1613.68] Yeah.
[1613.86 → 1614.46] Okay, yeah, yeah.
[1614.68 → 1618.30] Because the Game Max Circuit video got 1500 views.
[1618.62 → 1618.90] Sure.
[1619.66 → 1620.54] I was one of them.
[1621.80 → 1622.76] And now I know.
[1623.08 → 1623.46] Right?
[1623.46 → 1624.70] Like, that's what we're doing.
[1625.02 → 1627.12] That's what we're trying to do.
[1628.98 → 1637.42] And it's going to take time to build out the verticals that we want to build out.
[1637.52 → 1639.90] It's going to take time to automate what we need to automate.
[1640.10 → 1641.60] There's a lot of that to be done.
[1642.22 → 1643.78] There's a lot of work to do.
[1643.78 → 1648.64] There's also, like, I know there's been some criticism put towards the lab in regard to automation.
[1648.64 → 1653.22] Because some people have pointed out, like, the more you automate stuff, the more you remove the human touch.
[1653.22 → 1655.44] And you're less likely to catch things and stuff.
[1656.00 → 1661.12] We're not trying to automate a lot of those types of things, to be clear.
[1661.26 → 1669.96] And I'm not trying to increase automation in the labs actually necessarily to increase the amount that they can even do necessarily.
[1669.96 → 1675.32] I'm trying to make sure they can spend more time verifying results and retesting things and doing things like that.
[1676.52 → 1678.74] So, yeah, it's okay.
[1678.74 → 1679.30] Okay.
[1683.30 → 1687.62] I don't think we ever actually ended up finishing the...
[1687.62 → 1690.70] I do think it's an interesting thing to consider, though.
[1690.98 → 1697.56] That pretty much all the things that you just pointed at for a non-tech...
[1697.56 → 1697.74] Yep.
[1697.90 → 1703.18] We are diving into headfirst, attempting to do the same thing.
[1703.18 → 1708.72] But what percentage of our headcount is working on PSU Circuit?
[1712.40 → 1713.84] It's going to be three people.
[1714.46 → 1714.70] Okay.
[1714.90 → 1716.30] Which is a pretty considerable amount.
[1717.04 → 1717.60] But...
[1717.60 → 1719.66] It takes a very noticeable amount of time.
[1719.66 → 1729.76] But is there a benefit to the projects that the other people are working on that do make money to having this resource and to having this knowledge?
[1730.04 → 1730.36] Yes.
[1731.10 → 1731.52] All right.
[1731.84 → 1733.54] But it's just, you know...
[1733.54 → 1735.44] I'm just saying.
[1735.58 → 1736.08] I'm just saying.
[1736.20 → 1737.06] I have a vision.
[1738.02 → 1739.62] I have a vision right now.
[1739.86 → 1740.68] I'm having a vision.
[1740.76 → 1745.10] And to be clear, just because I think some people might be getting squiggly legs right now.
[1746.04 → 1747.84] I support the labs project.
[1747.84 → 1748.32] But...
[1748.32 → 1750.98] I'm just trying to push them a little bit.
[1752.40 → 1753.62] Look, I will...
[1753.62 → 1754.62] I'll defend it all day.
[1754.88 → 1755.10] Yeah.
[1755.28 → 1756.18] I'll defend it all day.
[1756.32 → 1757.12] Because...
[1757.12 → 1758.22] I'm just...
[1758.22 → 1758.80] I'm just saying.
[1759.22 → 1763.80] All the criticisms that you lobby towards, a non-tech, are the exact same things that we are doing.
[1763.86 → 1764.92] But what a non-tech doesn't...
[1764.92 → 1765.40] Or planning to do.
[1765.48 → 1769.16] What a non-tech doesn't have is it doesn't have LTT.
[1770.06 → 1770.30] Yeah.
[1770.80 → 1772.60] LTT is...
[1772.60 → 1776.64] Is basically this, like, evolution machine.
[1776.64 → 1780.42] It is taking the feedback from the community.
[1781.12 → 1783.94] It is processing it through the writing team, through me.
[1784.28 → 1787.12] And it is constantly shifting and changing.
[1787.94 → 1789.50] And sometimes it changes forward.
[1789.64 → 1790.86] Sometimes it changes backward.
[1791.00 → 1795.46] But it's constantly trying new things in order to increase engagement.
[1795.46 → 1798.04] In order to make sure that this business stays sustainable.
[1798.94 → 1803.68] In order to feed resources back into the machine that is supposed to build these resources.
[1803.68 → 1806.64] That will, in turn, make LTT more authoritative.
[1806.64 → 1811.04] Which will, in turn, bring more viewership and more resources.
[1811.04 → 1812.98] Which will allow us to continue to build it.
[1812.98 → 1821.30] The way that I've been seeing it is that some people have said that the LTT Labs team is supposed to be a support department for writing.
[1821.60 → 1823.58] And I don't necessarily see it that way.
[1823.66 → 1824.98] I think we are...
[1824.98 → 1828.50] We are supposed to support, yes.
[1828.54 → 1831.66] But we're supposed to support the content creation of the company.
[1831.66 → 1833.54] That doesn't necessarily just mean writing.
[1833.54 → 1836.46] That doesn't necessarily mean a singular part of writing.
[1836.46 → 1839.64] That just means content creation within the company at all.
[1839.78 → 1842.42] That also includes the LTT Labs website.
[1842.52 → 1844.30] Which is technically a separate thing from LTT Labs.
[1844.32 → 1847.20] But we're supporting the content of the LTT Labs website.
[1848.48 → 1855.40] And a lot of the ways that we do that is like this constant generation of articles and reviews that we're doing.
[1855.50 → 1856.94] Say, on the website.
[1856.94 → 1868.18] In reality, do we really expect those articles to make enough money to be like this awesome business within Linus Media Group?
[1869.10 → 1870.92] Cop, cough, look at what's happening to Anand.
[1871.04 → 1871.82] No, not really.
[1872.04 → 1876.08] But by doing that, we're going to keep up to speed.
[1876.36 → 1880.16] We're going to be in the dirt of what's happening with these components all the time.
[1880.16 → 1886.34] So we ideally know what's going on or have at least a good idea of what's going on.
[1886.34 → 1888.40] Because we'll be trying things out all the time.
[1888.48 → 1890.10] Will we be able to catch everything?
[1890.54 → 1890.92] No.
[1892.24 → 1897.62] But it should keep our level of educatedness on all of these topics up quite high.
[1897.80 → 1898.34] That's the goal.
[1898.50 → 1899.08] And you know what?
[1899.10 → 1899.76] It's been slow.
[1900.16 → 1904.92] And we're not going to rush anything at this point.
[1905.48 → 1906.16] So it's going to take...
[1906.16 → 1907.70] In some situations, we are slowing down.
[1908.04 → 1908.28] Yeah.
[1908.28 → 1911.56] And we're going to take as long as we need to take.
[1912.16 → 1912.28] And...
[1913.96 → 1916.12] Godspeed.
[1918.00 → 1918.78] Heck yeah.
[1921.28 → 1922.00] All right.
[1922.68 → 1924.66] Topic two, says our paper over there.
[1925.28 → 1928.20] The Telegram CEO was arrested in France.
[1928.30 → 1928.52] Yeah.
[1929.24 → 1936.24] Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, arrested this week on suspicion of failing to act against illicit actions on the service,
[1936.24 → 1942.06] service such as drug trafficking, fraud, and the exchange of child sexual assault material.
[1942.50 → 1948.24] His arrest has caused a debate about free speech and government censorship with figures such as...
[1948.84 → 1949.10] Ugh.
[1949.10 → 1954.02] You can't even say his name?
[1954.48 → 1956.62] Is this like your personal Voldemort now?
[1956.62 → 1957.94] No, but it's just so stupid.
[1961.32 → 1966.12] With figures such as Elon Musk and Edward Snowden publicly defending Duroc,
[1966.12 → 1974.94] as if Twitter doesn't follow all the rules with respect to, you know, backdoors and whatever else.
[1974.94 → 1980.48] It's like, it's only some irrelevant market in South America that they'll go to bat against.
[1980.74 → 1982.30] Give it a rest.
[1983.10 → 1986.56] Anyway, Edward Snowden has at least some street cred here.
[1986.56 → 1991.24] Duroc certainly seems to have a history of resisting government influence.
[1991.36 → 1995.32] Now, he seems to actually have a history of it, not just a history of being a blowhard.
[1995.92 → 2001.92] In 2006, he created the Facebook-like social media site now called VK in his native country of Russia.
[2002.42 → 2005.38] It quickly became adopted by Russia's political opposition.
[2005.94 → 2011.34] The Kremlin allegedly began pressuring Duroc to sell the site to more state-sympathetic parties in 2011.
[2011.34 → 2016.00] And when the Kremlin pressures you to do something, you either do it or you end up dead.
[2016.08 → 2025.02] It's actually very different from the kind of bleeding about, you know, political censorship or whatever else that happens from some people.
[2026.04 → 2032.80] Duroc left Russia in 2014, claiming it was to avoid requests from the Kremlin to hand over the data of Ukrainian protesters,
[2033.14 → 2036.16] though he did succumb to pressure and sell his VK shares.
[2036.30 → 2038.94] To be clear, government censorship does happen here.
[2039.26 → 2039.52] Yes.
[2039.52 → 2040.68] The bleeding or not.
[2040.92 → 2041.14] Yes.
[2041.34 → 2042.86] It's just, yeah.
[2043.24 → 2047.22] It's very different from, hey, you should sell your shares.
[2047.36 → 2052.54] And then if you don't, then you jump out of a window.
[2053.82 → 2055.76] And shoot yourself in the back of the head at the same time.
[2055.84 → 2056.08] Yeah.
[2056.32 → 2056.62] Yeah.
[2056.90 → 2057.10] Yeah.
[2057.70 → 2057.96] Yeah.
[2058.08 → 2058.22] Yeah.
[2058.74 → 2059.72] Very crafty.
[2060.36 → 2060.90] All right.
[2061.64 → 2065.06] While Telegram has a reputation for lax moderation,
[2065.48 → 2070.92] Duroc gave an interview to Financial Times this March where he claimed Telegram planned to improve moderation
[2070.92 → 2073.54] within the year using AI-related mechanisms,
[2073.54 → 2078.80] though he stated he didn't think the app should police people unless they cross red lines.
[2078.80 → 2082.12] It's not clear what those lines are to him.
[2082.12 → 2091.50] This arrest has reignited the conversation on end-to-end encryption since Duroc was also charged with providing encryption without the required declaration.
[2091.50 → 2097.78] But Telegram's encryption is actually pretty bad, says our notes.
[2097.78 → 2099.12] It's not on by default.
[2099.24 → 2101.12] The setting is not the easiest thing to find.
[2101.28 → 2107.70] It only works for one-on-one conversations and can only be enabled when your conversation partner is also online.
[2107.70 → 2108.26] Interesting.
[2108.84 → 2112.12] Which I have to confess, I actually didn't know that.
[2112.26 → 2118.40] I knew Signal was like the better one, but I actually didn't know these details.
[2119.82 → 2122.94] Is it actually bad or are the settings just bad?
[2123.64 → 2126.76] As I said, the encryption is bad, but is that true?
[2127.00 → 2130.86] Well, if it only works while your partner's online, it leaves a lot of room for error.
[2130.86 → 2133.36] It can only be enabled when the partner's online.
[2133.58 → 2134.46] It's also online, yeah.
[2134.46 → 2137.26] I'm assuming you turn it on, and then it's on for that conversation.
[2137.26 → 2141.22] Yeah, to me, that's a really poor mechanism for encryption.
[2141.54 → 2144.10] If I am using an app that I think is encrypted...
[2144.10 → 2146.12] Yeah, but that doesn't mean that the encryption itself is bad.
[2146.12 → 2146.98] No, no, no.
[2147.02 → 2149.80] I'm not saying AES, whatever, like the actual encryption.
[2149.98 → 2156.00] I'm saying the implementation of the encryption in the app leaves a lot of room for user error.
[2156.22 → 2157.52] Is that a better way of phrasing it?
[2157.72 → 2158.52] Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2158.52 → 2161.78] I just think saying the encryption is bad is rough.
[2161.86 → 2163.48] I'm trying to see, is this the one that I use?
[2163.54 → 2164.84] I always get them mixed up.
[2164.84 → 2172.04] But Wiley in Float plane Chat says, I've also seen some academic analyses that their crypto design is questionable at best.
[2172.30 → 2172.78] Okay, yeah.
[2173.14 → 2174.70] I'm not even saying it's not legit.
[2174.82 → 2175.70] I just, I don't know.
[2177.80 → 2181.30] Because it's hand-rolled implementation instead of using a standard, well-tested one.
[2181.30 → 2187.16] Yeah, there's a number of people that are talking in Float plane Chat about how it's like got issues, apparently.
[2187.76 → 2189.70] Or at least could have issues.
[2191.76 → 2193.42] So, Luke.
[2193.90 → 2194.22] Yes.
[2195.48 → 2196.32] I'm trying to figure, okay.
[2197.26 → 2199.78] An interesting take that I read on this.
[2199.78 → 2203.80] I believe this was an article somewhere I was reading.
[2204.28 → 2204.68] I forget.
[2205.04 → 2211.80] The point is, they basically were like, okay, here's a devil's advocate sort of take on this.
[2212.04 → 2213.68] You know, I signed up for Telegram.
[2213.86 → 2215.02] I, like, joined some groups.
[2215.02 → 2228.96] And within minutes, I had offers for everything from drugs to human trafficking to government, state-sponsored subterfuge.
[2229.62 → 2240.74] Like, it was absolutely wild how Telegram was essentially, should you choose to unlock that capability, which is very simple to do,
[2241.22 → 2244.42] was basically a black market, essentially.
[2244.42 → 2249.38] That's one perspective.
[2249.82 → 2256.58] Where if you were to go, okay, he's in trouble for, you know, what, providing people with encrypted communication.
[2256.58 → 2258.14] That sounds pretty bad.
[2258.98 → 2266.22] Or he is in trouble for essentially running a black market social network.
[2267.86 → 2271.76] I have a complicated position on this.
[2271.88 → 2273.78] But I thought maybe I'd let you go first.
[2273.78 → 2274.50] What are your thoughts?
[2275.44 → 2275.98] I don't know.
[2276.66 → 2279.70] Government-enforced platform moderation is always kind of a weird thing.
[2279.70 → 2282.78] State-sponsored subterfuge, not centrifuge.
[2283.06 → 2284.28] Did you say centrifuge?
[2284.34 → 2284.60] No.
[2284.88 → 2285.06] Oh.
[2285.44 → 2286.34] Who said centrifuge?
[2286.42 → 2287.40] Someone in the chat.
[2287.68 → 2288.98] That's Student, right?
[2292.48 → 2293.48] That's pretty good.
[2294.18 → 2295.02] For uranium?
[2295.02 → 2295.58] What?
[2297.58 → 2298.66] Oh, float plane chat.
[2298.66 → 2299.54] Oh, sorry.
[2299.62 → 2300.50] I liked Dan's comment.
[2302.62 → 2303.32] Yeah, I don't know.
[2303.98 → 2308.08] Yeah, like state-required moderation of platforms is weird.
[2308.08 → 2311.12] It goes both ways, right?
[2311.14 → 2313.30] It's the same thing as the opposite.
[2313.80 → 2317.24] State-required non-moderation of platforms is also weird, in my opinion.
[2317.24 → 2323.66] Like when people say like, rah-rah, but my free speech, it's like, sure, but this isn't government property.
[2323.66 → 2327.56] Or public property, or anything of the sort.
[2327.68 → 2329.12] This is my random website.
[2329.26 → 2335.44] We also have to be super careful with like free speech, because free speech means free of government oppression.
[2335.56 → 2338.56] It doesn't mean anything to do with a private entity that owns a platform.
[2338.78 → 2338.94] Yeah.
[2339.36 → 2348.22] So that's kind of weird in one side, but then the government forcing it is also weird.
[2348.22 → 2351.14] Because again, it's my platform, isn't it?
[2351.60 → 2352.46] So that's odd.
[2352.46 → 2357.12] But if they make certain things, I don't know.
[2357.52 → 2359.06] But there has to be some oversight, right?
[2359.06 → 2361.82] Because you can't say like...
[2361.82 → 2366.44] Because you can't harbour, there's the whatever, being an accessory to a crime or whatever.
[2366.44 → 2372.34] If I'm a government, and I tell you, look, you're not allowed to log anything from minors.
[2372.92 → 2374.26] Or even suspected minors.
[2374.38 → 2374.54] Yeah.
[2374.86 → 2376.34] So like I do support that.
[2376.60 → 2377.52] I would support that.
[2377.68 → 2377.80] Yeah.
[2378.44 → 2379.88] It's a nuanced conversation.
[2380.00 → 2380.30] Yes.
[2380.30 → 2385.90] But I don't think there's any avoiding that for me.
[2385.90 → 2394.82] I support the existence of a platform like this, even if I wouldn't run it.
[2394.82 → 2402.72] It's scary when there are no tools to not be observed by the government.
[2403.42 → 2408.88] Because we have seen so many times throughout history that just not go well.
[2409.38 → 2410.54] But the thing is that like...
[2410.54 → 2410.62] I don't know.
[2410.62 → 2413.96] But then you also don't want to harbour all this bad stuff.
[2414.08 → 2416.70] There should be an expectation of privacy.
[2417.16 → 2417.26] Yes.
[2417.26 → 2426.50] I mean, when you sent a letter in the year 1823 or whatever, the expectation was that it is illegal to read it.
[2426.58 → 2426.78] Yeah.
[2426.98 → 2428.02] I don't care who you are.
[2428.10 → 2429.36] You are not allowed to open it.
[2429.52 → 2429.70] Yeah.
[2429.82 → 2431.08] That's like not how that works.
[2431.08 → 2434.54] And that's basically all that Telegram is.
[2436.00 → 2436.52] Name?
[2436.86 → 2436.96] Yeah.
[2437.12 → 2437.20] Right?
[2437.76 → 2438.80] That's all it is.
[2439.00 → 2447.92] Is it's an implicitly telegrammed message to someone that is intended for their eyes and their eyes only.
[2448.18 → 2448.26] Yeah.
[2448.26 → 2450.68] And so, you know, I look at this and I go...
[2450.68 → 2454.62] So if a platform wants to do that, it's hard for me to say that they shouldn't be able to.
[2454.62 → 2465.14] And if they're Chad enough to stand up to the regimes that would oppress people for communicating about things that aren't human trafficking,
[2465.34 → 2469.98] that are just living their lives and existing and that aren't bothering anybody,
[2470.18 → 2476.58] like freedom of expression, freedom of religion, whatever the case may be, then that's great.
[2476.86 → 2477.84] Like, you go, girl.
[2477.84 → 2478.58] That's the weird thing.
[2478.70 → 2481.96] Like tools, screwdriver here, you could stab someone with it.
[2482.04 → 2484.10] You can use a hammer for bad things.
[2484.28 → 2487.00] This is an argument that works for so many things.
[2487.06 → 2493.54] Something that can absolutely be used for good can very often also be used for bad things.
[2494.62 → 2497.62] But I don't know.
[2497.70 → 2503.16] You put yourself in a terrible spot if you remove these things that can be used for good because they can also be used for bad.
[2503.36 → 2503.46] Yeah.
[2503.48 → 2505.44] You lose out on incredibly important things.
[2505.44 → 2509.38] I mean, we talked about this in our recent, like, hacking tools.
[2510.10 → 2510.32] Yeah.
[2510.78 → 2510.98] Yeah.
[2510.98 → 2511.76] Where it's like, what?
[2511.90 → 2512.96] So we get rid of hammers?
[2512.96 → 2513.14] If you ban those.
[2513.52 → 2513.70] Yeah.
[2513.72 → 2514.44] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2514.44 → 2514.84] Good point.
[2514.86 → 2515.60] It's the hammer argument.
[2515.74 → 2515.94] Yeah.
[2515.94 → 2525.42] But with the hacking tools, if you ban all the hacking tools, then people aren't going to know how secure their things are as easily.
[2525.42 → 2529.82] And also the people that have the ability to just make them anyway.
[2530.00 → 2530.22] Yeah.
[2530.22 → 2533.70] Because some of them aren't inherently that complicated.
[2533.88 → 2533.98] No.
[2533.98 → 2542.32] Or now that the like, plans for making them are online, if you're crafty, you can make maybe a not quite as good version, but you can make your own version anyway.
[2542.52 → 2544.66] So, like, they're still going to exist.
[2544.82 → 2544.92] But.
[2545.06 → 2547.66] And now it's just harder for good people to get their hands on it.
[2547.66 → 2556.76] But with all of that said, I couldn't look in the eye of a trafficking victim who had escaped and tell them.
[2556.76 → 2557.90] Which is why we didn't make our own VPN.
[2558.00 → 2562.48] And tell them, you know, I'm going to keep running this platform.
[2563.08 → 2566.64] I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't have it in me.
[2567.86 → 2570.20] Which is why we, yeah, we don't do that.
[2570.20 → 2573.64] So it's, honestly, for me, it's the same, it's the same logic.
[2574.14 → 2577.52] I, I, forget her name.
[2577.90 → 2579.66] Um, she's, like, super private.
[2580.08 → 2581.72] Um, hold on.
[2584.30 → 2585.12] What's her name?
[2585.34 → 2586.76] Uh, no, no, no, no, no.
[2590.12 → 2591.28] Ugh, I can't remember.
[2591.42 → 2594.64] There's, there's someone who works on another, like, privacy platform.
[2594.84 → 2595.98] She's, she's super cool.
[2596.56 → 2598.62] Uh, she did a she did an interview recently.
[2598.74 → 2599.98] She doesn't do that many of them.
[2600.30 → 2603.60] Um, but basically she was like, yeah, this is really important.
[2604.46 → 2605.96] Um, dang it.
[2606.30 → 2606.58] Anyway.
[2606.58 → 2609.74] Well, whatever her, her whole being private thing worked then.
[2610.46 → 2611.18] Uh, anyway.
[2611.28 → 2611.42] Yeah.
[2611.42 → 2614.22] The point is, yeah, for me, uh, it's, it's really important.
[2614.36 → 2617.06] I, I support end-to-end encryption.
[2617.70 → 2618.18] I.
[2618.48 → 2618.80] Me too.
[2620.68 → 2621.02] Huh.
[2621.14 → 2627.88] And, and, you know, I think there's room for, there's room for conversations around what that
[2627.88 → 2629.28] implementation looks like.
[2629.28 → 2635.88] Like, should we be allowed to have an end-to-end encrypted, um, you know, very large group
[2635.88 → 2641.04] chat, for example, where you could, you could organize a an attack or something like that.
[2641.04 → 2643.30] And it's like, well, oh yeah, maybe that would be bad.
[2643.30 → 2645.72] But then the flip side of that is, okay.
[2646.30 → 2651.04] Um, the government has, uh, has, has, oh, okay.
[2651.04 → 2651.50] This is great.
[2651.56 → 2656.70] The government has declared, um, that what's his, what's his nuts won the election, even
[2656.70 → 2660.74] though there's pretty significant evidence that he actually, um, didn't.
[2660.74 → 2665.46] And people need to, people need to organize so that they can gather so they can resist.
[2666.08 → 2668.82] Like, that's why, that's why these platforms need to exist.
[2668.92 → 2669.82] The only problem.
[2670.02 → 2673.36] What if a place is under attack, and you're trying to evacuate as many people as you possibly
[2673.36 → 2678.82] can and communications are being monitored so they can create choke points, and you want
[2678.82 → 2679.34] to avoid that.
[2679.40 → 2683.98] Like there's, there are lots of super legitimate reasons as to why you would want these tools.
[2683.98 → 2689.92] And, and the problem is that they don't move at the speed of a telegram anymore.
[2690.24 → 2690.64] Yeah.
[2690.74 → 2694.88] So they move so fast that they're hard for enforcement to stay on top of.
[2694.96 → 2696.72] They're hard to, they're hard to deal with.
[2696.74 → 2699.68] And there's, there's really, there's terrible stuff happening.
[2700.52 → 2703.68] And it's, it's not like this stuff isn't going to happen.
[2705.00 → 2706.80] Even if you take telegram away.
[2706.90 → 2711.44] No, but these tools are so powerful now they can happen so fast.
[2711.80 → 2712.50] No, I know.
[2712.50 → 2717.14] Money moves around in shadows just so much more easily than it used to.
[2717.22 → 2720.72] Like, I don't even want to name them because I don't want to, I'm, I'm going to,
[2720.72 → 2721.72] I don't want to name them.
[2721.72 → 2722.72] I don't want to name them.
[2722.72 → 2723.72] Yeah.
[2723.72 → 2724.72] I don't want to name them.
[2724.72 → 2725.72] I don't want to name them.
[2725.72 → 2726.72] Yeah.
[2726.72 → 2732.20] happens on their platform anyway but discord yeah practically everyone has it these days
[2732.20 → 2738.10] yeah, and you can set up a server and invite 2 000 people to it instantly, and it all works
[2738.10 → 2743.62] instantly and the there's no like personally identifying information to create an account
[2743.62 → 2748.52] throwaway account knowing it's going to be banned in two days yeah and not care and then just
[2748.52 → 2754.48] whether it's encrypted or not people are just going to be, and they're i oh man again i was
[2754.48 → 2761.14] reading some article about this or other um and apparently there's just all kinds of like
[2761.14 → 2771.20] shorthands for discussing illicit material that like i as a person who doesn't get into that
[2771.20 → 2775.88] um like i could read a conversation and i could have no idea that it's even about that
[2775.88 → 2782.96] well that was a whole thing i did not follow this enough okay and this is probably I'm gonna
[2782.96 → 2787.80] this is going to open a can of worms i just remember a lot of the whole keyword thing that you're
[2787.80 → 2793.44] talking about being a part of this conversation but the whole Pizzagate thing yeah pizza and hot
[2793.44 → 2797.66] dogs and do you want lunch and all this other type of stuff where it all means something else
[2797.66 → 2803.62] it's like okay these sound like completely normal conversations but like yeah i don't know
[2803.62 → 2808.46] uh
[2808.46 → 2814.76] russellmania says yeah uh crimes use code words i love that he called them crimes i read it too
[2814.76 → 2820.54] me to that's great, thank you for that okay we're not talking about the Pizzagate conspiracy theory
[2820.54 → 2827.44] around the like one pizza restaurant just um just the terminology okay bring it up i just remember
[2827.44 → 2832.54] there are a lot of conversations at that time about code words that's all um someone said discord needs
[2832.54 → 2841.26] to moderate their platform better do you have any concept at all of how genuinely insane that would
[2841.26 → 2849.74] be it'd be impossible what a crazy task if is we want properly like if we want moderated discord on
[2849.74 → 2856.00] the level that you're talking about i hope you're ready to pay 15 bucks a month like or more yeah that's
[2856.00 → 2863.60] the thing like these services are only viable as long as they're financially viable right like you
[2863.60 → 2874.94] can't just say oh well they need to okay with what army right like it is can't even just be it can't
[2874.94 → 2880.00] even just be random like these people would need training they need criminal record checks you know they
[2880.00 → 2885.86] would need the whole thing would have to be monitored and overseen who does it right
[2885.86 → 2895.28] comment said or pay per server lol yeah except discord killed all of those yeah ventral and TeamSpeak
[2895.28 → 2900.30] and all those services are gone basically i know i technically still use TeamSpeak some of them like
[2900.30 → 2907.68] the TeamSpeak technically exists but like come on it is not the same thing and the thing that killed
[2907.68 → 2912.58] them all was discord because the servers are free so
[2912.58 → 2927.56] but you know how to send a merch message but if you don't know don't send a twitch bit don't send a
[2927.56 → 2933.48] super chat if you want to interact with the show like this like Tara o down here all you got to do is
[2933.48 → 2938.52] send a merch message go to lttstore.com throw something in your cart we'll have a couple of
[2938.52 → 2942.40] suggestions for you in a minute we've got some stuff to talk about throw something in your cart, and you'll be
[2942.40 → 2950.94] prompted to send a merch message you'll get a reply from Dan okay which may or may not be useful depending on
[2950.94 → 2960.08] what kind of mood he's having um it was warranted they're always warranted, or he'll forward it internally, or he will
[2960.08 → 2965.84] curate it for me and Luke so we'll show you guys how some curated merch messages might look and then
[2965.84 → 2969.92] we'll give you guys kind of the update for what's going on the store hit me Dan
[2969.92 → 2976.46] sure thing let's see what we've got here hello Dan Luke and random beardless blonde dude
[2976.46 → 2981.74] uh Linus if when you retire from YouTube would you still do the wan show you guys are big part of my
[2981.74 → 2989.40] weekly routine i would hate to see you go um don't freak out but Luke and i have had this conversation
[2989.40 → 2999.30] very recently and i think we more or less agreed on yeah yeah yeah that the show must go on
[2999.30 → 3004.56] the wan show specifically i mean it's one of those things where it's kind of a's kind of a no-brainer
[3004.56 → 3012.84] because there's no way that Luke and i are going to stop like reading tech news um it's not really
[3012.84 → 3019.38] that much work for us to take the discord chats that we might have throughout the week and just
[3019.38 → 3027.34] not do that and then point a camera at you know when we get together and chat it's uh it's in a time
[3027.34 → 3032.62] slot that doesn't really interfere with people who don't have a life as lame as that is yeah
[3032.62 → 3040.04] it has very rarely been a problem for me yeah there's that Katie perry song i have no idea what
[3040.04 → 3047.14] she's talking about yeah we sat at a tabletop yeah we talked about some tech
[3047.14 → 3057.24] oh my goodness um and to be clear like we're we still got we still got a mission right like
[3057.24 → 3063.22] um having Luke taking a close look at what's going on with the labs has been really
[3063.22 → 3069.62] refreshing uh it's really exciting because we've we've got a lot of work to do um you know looking
[3069.62 → 3077.68] at the path forward for the channels the various channels here um it's been really nice to see LTT on
[3077.68 → 3085.52] the upswing again yeah and this is big agree this is in spite of how difficult it is to make tech
[3085.52 → 3090.44] interesting but damn it that's what we do that's what we do you guys are figuring it out there's
[3090.44 → 3096.38] there's been some real bangers that's what we do really, really well we've got a great team um
[3096.38 → 3102.06] the sentiment on scrapyard wars is insane yeah that was a lot of fun things are getting to
[3102.06 → 3107.30] the point where you can kind of get into things affordably again maybe a little bit as long as you've
[3107.30 → 3112.72] got a little bit of you know scrapyard war spirit, and you're willing to get in there and learn some
[3112.72 → 3120.86] stuff um which is danged it that's our wheelhouse right so man I'm uh I'm I'm excited I'm actually
[3120.86 → 3127.64] pretty good right now I'm optimistic um more so than I've been in a while to be perfectly honest
[3127.64 → 3134.94] with you guys right like if you look at how the last 365 days have gone for the channel um you know
[3134.94 → 3141.42] we were in we were in a pretty rough state last September it wasn't good, and you know we'd have a
[3141.42 → 3147.06] banger or two here we'd have a couple good uploads, and then it's been this kind of this pattern of
[3147.06 → 3151.80] like yeah we like to recover for a bit, and then it's like it's like we've been swimming against the
[3151.80 → 3159.92] current for a long, long time, but then you look at that trend line what happens here in July and i mean
[3159.92 → 3165.12] even this low point here is not nearly what we were looking at back there right so you look at
[3165.12 → 3171.86] this low point in July, and you go kind of like oh things are on the up and up you know
[3171.86 → 3177.68] finally we're we're pulling it together uh we're figuring out you know what is the new meta
[3177.68 → 3185.30] what are people looking for um what is the mix that we need of reviews of things that people need to
[3185.30 → 3194.14] know about like you know snapdragon x uh snapdragon x or um like okay yeah here's one that didn't
[3194.14 → 3200.78] perform particularly well uh AMD's new mobile AMD's new mobile chips versus you know what are what
[3200.78 → 3206.12] are the content styles that are going to appeal more broadly uh like this one's a really
[3206.12 → 3212.00] good example where it didn't necessarily start out doing too great honestly like if you look it's at
[3212.00 → 3217.82] the low end of what our of what our typical range is for video performance then it just keeps going
[3217.82 → 3224.04] but we figured out how to do this more often how to find stuff that achieves i call this like uh
[3224.04 → 3231.34] escape velocity yeah right where we're finding ways to make content that appeals algorithmically to
[3231.34 → 3237.10] the YouTube audience um in a way that we were struggling with for a while so I'm I'm actually I'm
[3237.10 → 3243.78] really optimistic because we're going to be able to do that better with more foundational testing and
[3243.78 → 3249.30] we're going to be able to afford to build foundational testing as long as we can continue to do that better
[3249.30 → 3255.30] as we go, and you know sometimes um the content that we're uploading these days has been a little
[3255.30 → 3260.36] controversial i mean that stock android one definitely ruffled some feathers but i don't think
[3260.36 → 3267.82] my thing has ever been having the same opinion as everybody else no and I'm I've been tired of that
[3267.82 → 3275.12] for i think i feel like it's been like two or maybe even three years when for some reason uh people in
[3275.12 → 3279.74] the tech space have been obsessed with all the reviewers saying the same thing and if they don't
[3279.74 → 3287.36] it's like a huge problem that's just rough I'm not going to do it no good like yeah that's okay not good
[3287.36 → 3294.10] and you know what the funny thing is in time a lot of the time the discourse kind of comes around to
[3294.10 → 3302.08] my position do you remember what a firestorm it set off when i said that ad block was piracy
[3302.08 → 3312.44] is that coming around yeah really oh yeah it's dude watching when i said that it was like it was
[3312.44 → 3317.68] like i had dropped a nuclear bomb on my career essentially like you wouldn't believe and some
[3317.68 → 3324.02] people are still super mad about if it's weird when i see the community wholeheartedly embrace
[3324.02 → 3328.78] piracy, and then you say this one thing is piracy, and they're like no it isn't it's like wait what
[3328.78 → 3335.42] but i never said don't do it i never said don't be able to are you all trading Linux ISOs on your
[3335.42 → 3340.16] Plex servers what are you even talking about like we meme on this stuff all the time yeah relax bro
[3340.16 → 3346.86] yeah um and it's the same thing it's the same thing with warranty gate yeah what all i said was
[3346.86 → 3356.38] if it's only worth the paper it's printed on the value of a warranty is solely i do think the value
[3356.38 → 3362.38] i will say of the company's willingness to fulfill it i will say i still think okay so i messaged it
[3362.38 → 3369.14] terribly yeah yeah yeah i messaged it terribly it was wrapped in like the worst packaging you could
[3369.14 → 3373.90] ever imagine but the underlying i don't disagree with the underlying statement well you know what
[3373.90 → 3379.32] it was Luke was I was thinking back to a conversation that I'd actually had with another content creator
[3379.32 → 3385.18] who knows who they are um I'm not going to name this content creator sure, but it was a conversation
[3385.18 → 3389.80] that i had with another content creator where i was talking about what the contingency plan was in
[3389.80 → 3394.58] the event of mine and Yvonne's passing and how the company could continue to operate and they
[3394.58 → 3401.34] basically said to me well my company is specifically set up with a poison pill clause so the second i
[3401.34 → 3406.58] drop-dead everything's gone everyone loses their jobs the brand can't continue because you know it
[3406.58 → 3412.42] could reflect on me posthumously and no one has any warranty and i was like that's pretty up was sort
[3412.42 → 3418.12] of my response to that and this is a content creator again they know who they are um and i was
[3418.12 → 3422.94] like nobody has any okay wow because they sell products you're you're an actual f***ING
[3422.94 → 3429.74] a**hole essentially right because like the level of narcissism on display was sort of
[3429.74 → 3435.78] mind-boggling to me yeah because of the the just whole thing or the warranty's not all of it
[3435.78 → 3440.74] okay all of it the fact that everyone is just like instantly out of a job because
[3440.74 → 3447.98] this thing couldn't possibly be good without you like are you do you have done you have any
[3447.98 → 3455.44] concerns does it smell bad living inside your own rectum like honestly though uh do you have
[3455.44 → 3460.78] is that a concern for you at all like i and i know you're mad at this thing but let's hold on
[3460.78 → 3466.98] so that was where i was coming from when i said that super weird thing about how whatever we put
[3466.98 → 3472.22] together should be something that can outlast because i remember whatever yeah it should be
[3472.22 → 3478.70] something that is structured correctly such that it could be maintained in the event that it wasn't
[3478.70 → 3484.62] just down to me saying trust me bro and making sure that whether it makes financial sense or not
[3484.62 → 3493.46] we just take care of it that was what i said, but it was super weird the way that i explained it
[3493.46 → 3501.34] and it got twisted by people who know who they are um and i think you probably should have just
[3501.34 → 3506.08] wrote down a warranty anyway but well probably, but we also hadn't written one down the product
[3506.08 → 3510.84] wasn't launched Luke yeah yeah the product wasn't launched that was the craziest thing for me
[3510.84 → 3518.46] i said it's like one i think it was Luke it was kind of weird like refusing to write one Luke
[3518.46 → 3523.48] but then it was also really weird how much feedback there was when the thing wasn't even out we had
[3523.48 → 3529.48] the f***ING integrity to not take people's money to what okay here's a counter here's a counter
[3529.48 → 3534.52] we could have pre-sold the crap out of those products okay we wouldn't take people's money
[3534.52 → 3538.90] because we didn't want them to have uncertainty about it because we wanted them to have third
[3538.90 → 3543.44] party feedback on it before we were willing to take their money Luke did we do the pop-up before
[3543.44 → 3550.86] the warranty no i don't remember no we didn't okay i thought we did I don't remember any okay
[3550.86 → 3556.40] the whole thing was absolutely unhinged
[3556.40 → 3563.58] and it's hilarious now because in every conversation around people like talking about
[3563.58 → 3570.50] our customer service you see people that are like Linus said like yeah i saw one recently it was
[3570.50 → 3578.54] some of the zipper like peeled off a backpack or something yeah um oh my goodness and like i
[3578.54 → 3583.62] definitely have thoughts about that like from a sustainability standpoint i would rather see
[3583.62 → 3589.64] people like go get that patched and I'd I'd rather give people like a small you know credit for that
[3589.64 → 3596.98] or something then send a whole new backpack, but we stand behind the product and i believe that person
[3596.98 → 3604.32] was offered a new backpack would that be a cool option there's a there's a lot of work some way
[3604.32 → 3609.22] there's a lot of work involved because yeah really difficult yeah like it's not like we're it's not
[3609.22 → 3613.42] like we're a huge multinational brand, and we can have like a backpack service centre in every major
[3613.42 → 3620.90] city or whatever but yeah i mean there's definitely there's definitely you know things about that
[3620.90 → 3630.50] i personally i wouldn't submit a warranty request for that but personally i would stand
[3630.50 → 3640.76] behind our product right so sorry i was looking at uh give me one second sorry yeah this is clean
[3640.76 → 3643.20] i was looking at the Subreddit
[3643.20 → 3649.80] someone posted that during the show
[3649.80 → 3664.88] oh my goodness sometimes going through the Reddit is a terrifying experience, and sometimes it's just
[3664.88 → 3670.04] hilarious there people got some screenshot i think it was from scrapyard wars or something and they
[3670.04 → 3676.12] they remade the like drake meme where it's like no or like yeah i saw that that's so funny I've been
[3676.12 → 3681.78] enjoying those i don't know um ski up ghosts asks what about those who were unable to claim back the
[3681.78 → 3688.56] 25 you promised only on buying a single new product we offered them a full refund at the end of the day
[3688.56 → 3697.44] my liability to you is absolutely not more than the cost you spent on the product if you weren't happy
[3697.44 → 3699.50] with the 25 credit
[3699.50 → 3708.34] we offered a refund that's it that at that point we have done all that we can do I'm not going to give
[3708.34 → 3715.36] you a back massage like i i said i said trust me bro not take advantage of me bro yeah oh
[3715.36 → 3717.16] that's only said to me
[3717.84 → 3722.80] not on the show
[3722.80 → 3726.14] we've talked about this
[3726.14 → 3736.94] anyway uh what about front massage says that's a nice chat
[3736.94 → 3744.70] oh man should we go through our announcements we've got yeah yeah we've got wait well no we're
[3744.70 → 3749.00] supposed to do a couple merch messages we did one merch message one i want to kind of change
[3749.00 → 3752.68] up the format a bit we do one merch message you read all your announcements then we'll do another one
[3752.68 → 3757.74] and then we'll move on oh nice look at this guy being a producer you know he's had the title for
[3757.74 → 3762.92] a long time but that that was some does produce that was some no that was some next level producing
[3762.92 → 3768.36] that was he just produced the out of us that's that i feel produced we need like
[3768.36 → 3773.86] we need like a logo in the corner of his webcam that's like SSS plus I'm going to produce a resignation
[3773.86 → 3779.20] no i don't accept it he just said we're doing Sancho forever yeah so like quit
[3779.20 → 3784.04] you're stuck yeah well we wouldn't be working together technically, but we would still be doing
[3784.26 → 3784.54] Sancho
[3784.54 → 3791.86] dude this streak is going to be longer than my underwear okay the streak can never end
[3791.86 → 3796.58] you still wear underwear smells better too
[3796.58 → 3808.70] my goodness wow oh man uh now it's my uh right right right so we've got some announcements speaking
[3808.70 → 3813.96] of pop-ups uh yeah we're hosting a pop-up event speaking of not being willing to take people's
[3813.96 → 3819.30] money for unproven products although honestly our engineering team and our fashion team are getting
[3819.30 → 3823.74] good enough that i might be willing to start relaxing that now probably fine i think it's time
[3823.74 → 3828.92] for us to just treat our product design capabilities as like we're actually like pretty
[3828.92 → 3834.04] good at this point anyway i do agree, but the pop-ups are also kind of fun pop-ups are kind of
[3834.04 → 3840.12] fun so we're doing another pop-up that makes sense um on saturday, September 7th we are going to be
[3840.12 → 3846.80] doing a pop-up where we will be launching slash making available our brand new LTT precision multi-bit
[3846.80 → 3852.92] screwdriver and bit kit and if you come to the pop-up you will be able to purchase one of 500
[3852.92 → 3859.76] numbered precision screwdrivers as well uh are they numbered on them or where's the number it's
[3859.76 → 3864.66] uh lasered onto them oh that's great well not these because these aren't part of it is can't be
[3864.66 → 3868.92] numbered if you have extra ones to show on the Sancho totally they when we number something
[3868.92 → 3872.92] we number it actually oh man okay sorry I'm this derailment
[3872.92 → 3881.26] Luke and i Luke and i nick and i had a conversation recently we found a bunch of those Lamb beanies
[3881.26 → 3892.20] do you remember the 69 only Lamb beanies and i didn't know what to do we found apparently for
[3892.20 → 3898.08] minimum order quantity purposes we ordered more than 69 of them also to have warranty and etc um
[3898.08 → 3908.80] because we said we would only sell 69 of them but i hate waste um so the conversation what nick
[3908.80 → 3915.34] wanted to do was uh do like a promo on Sancho or something like that and i basically was like
[3915.34 → 3921.68] if we say there's only this many there can only be this many but our options are either to what
[3921.68 → 3928.24] sell them hold on to them forever yeah you don't want to do that or throw them away, and you don't
[3928.24 → 3933.48] want to burn them which i don't want to do like the okay fashion company is it okay to give them
[3933.48 → 3939.02] away the chat says it's okay to give them away i think giving them away is okay i so the numbered
[3939.02 → 3943.58] ones can be the ones we sold yeah, but we could still give them away is that okay gauntlet wizard
[3943.58 → 3949.48] said give them away in a promo that i don't necessarily know because there have to be a genuine
[3949.48 → 3955.54] giveaway so we can profit from more than just money like that's something that you guys
[3955.54 → 3960.22] got to consider just because i turn off the AdSense on my video for example that doesn't mean that i
[3960.22 → 3966.08] didn't benefit that i didn't profit that there isn't that there isn't a net benefit to me of
[3966.08 → 3970.08] uploading that video let's say if it's something that's going to get a lot of views it's its not
[3970.08 → 3975.32] that black and white the world is about more than just money right so if i use it for a promo i am
[3975.32 → 3984.32] absolutely profiting even if it's not directly financially um most people seem to think it's
[3984.32 → 3993.08] pretty cool to give them away so how many are there it's like 40 or something like i like maybe
[3993.08 → 3997.68] we had to order a couple of hundred or i don't know or like 150 i don't know exactly them don't
[3997.68 → 4002.54] quote me on the number it's less that it's way less than a thousand it's more than 10 let me ask the
[4002.54 → 4008.60] audience this because i feel like they're the most likely to lean in one direction um but i feel
[4008.60 → 4013.32] one thing that i suspect will be opposite to the audience so i want to check with them just to
[4013.32 → 4021.90] counter my bias um is it better to give it away internally or externally um because if you give it
[4021.90 → 4026.12] away externally then you're not selling it you're there's actually a lot less benefit i think we should
[4026.12 → 4032.06] give it away externally then, but it's not always easy giving stuff away is not always easy like
[4032.06 → 4037.50] people don't need the whole fast fashion movement chat's mostly saying internally
[4037.50 → 4044.80] uh it's kind of both sides yeah that's a company benefit that's a perk now that we've provided so in
[4044.80 → 4049.86] terms of like are we getting something out of it we actually like kind of are yeah whereas if we give
[4049.86 → 4055.96] it away externally and do it quietly so that nobody knows about it then it's the least benefit to the
[4055.96 → 4060.94] company interesting its zero benefit, so this is really important our gauntlet wizard says
[4060.94 → 4067.68] you're also profiting on any charity events by that logic you all yeah that's like the whole billionaire
[4067.68 → 4073.86] playbook why do you think any of them charity anything oh i made a billion dollars and suddenly i am
[4073.86 → 4079.70] now philanthropist that there's also like it's a whole it's a whole it's a whole rabbit hole it's not even
[4079.70 → 4086.80] just the reputational uh management of charity stuff it's there's a whole it's a whole thing but um
[4086.80 → 4093.64] that's that's that's one of the reasons we don't really talk about stuff much um, although there is
[4093.64 → 4100.74] something that we get to talk about this week because the thing that precipitated the donation was a very
[4100.74 → 4108.66] public event uh we ended up raising twenty thousand dollars oh and to be clear for the people for the
[4108.66 → 4114.42] electronic frontier foundation oh nice twenty thousand dollars with that uh dot fish shirt so
[4114.42 → 4122.46] thank you guys very much that was the full profits from that shirt very exciting um what is what am
[4122.46 → 4129.36] i'm looking at here is this like uh oh well okay whatever so here's uh here's the thing about the
[4129.36 → 4132.92] electronic frontier foundation there you go you can learn about them there cool I'll pause the video
[4132.92 → 4136.94] or whatever so that that's pretty exciting uh but yeah that's that's the only way to do it
[4136.94 → 4144.06] is to donate something and not talk about it at all um yeah and to be clear that doesn't mean that
[4144.06 → 4149.42] creators doing charity streams and stuff like that are like bad or like specifically doing it for profit
[4149.42 → 4155.68] but there is a benefit to if it's not it's not benefitless it's its less beneficial than
[4155.68 → 4164.46] them just doing like a station or a donated to me drive and in of some form um they are still
[4164.46 → 4169.54] giving that money to charity still benefiting from it etc etc etc, but it's not benefitless
[4169.54 → 4176.74] navy EMT says can you donate it to uh to a developing country actually that whole thing is a big problem
[4176.74 → 4181.88] so back to what i was saying about fast fashion there's now an excess of secondhand clothing
[4181.88 → 4187.08] because people just buy stuff wear it a couple of times, and it's so cheap they just oh yeah well
[4187.08 → 4194.28] I'll donate it and then like i don't have to feel bad about the massive dumping amount of raw materials
[4194.28 → 4200.82] and labour that goes into these products that I'm consuming and then using a couple of times like we
[4200.82 → 4206.82] i feel like there's been a huge mentality shift like when people would talk about people would talk
[4206.82 → 4214.42] about never wearing the same pair of underwear as like a completely unhinged out of touch you know
[4214.42 → 4220.42] behaviour we would laugh about it and joke about it but now it really does seem like people will
[4220.42 → 4226.52] will wear a shirt a few times and be like out of style now I'll just pick up something new on team
[4226.52 → 4233.36] you or it's so cheap and manufactured so poorly that it might be like somewhat destroyed by the third
[4233.36 → 4240.12] wear um the logo is all wrecked or maybe not logo but the thing on it is all wrecked or whatever
[4240.12 → 4246.66] else and so back to donating to other countries it's actually not necessarily a net benefit because
[4246.66 → 4252.64] what it can do is it can destroy the local market for those products destroying the companies that
[4252.64 → 4260.46] produce them making them forever dependent creating this cycle of dependency on like team you garbage that
[4260.46 → 4265.96] gets shipped across one ocean worn a couple of times and then handled a bunch of times and then shipped
[4265.96 → 4275.22] across another freaking ocean like the whole thing is oh so inefficient um I'm not saying we won't donate
[4275.22 → 4280.92] them if anything i think that's clearly the position I'm advocating for here is that we give them away
[4280.92 → 4286.58] externally but what i am saying is that it's not that black and white it ain't that simple yep
[4286.58 → 4298.94] yep um yeah four com five says go feed your local ducks then stop the thing that happens next isn't nice
[4298.94 → 4306.34] um okay let's go back to talking about our pop-up shop shall we Linus came here it is oh yeah wait how
[4306.34 → 4312.76] did we would don't worry about it okay uh so we'll have some other popular items from ltdstore.com
[4312.76 → 4319.98] including our recently launched off-site laptop bag and uh oh should we talk about the product a
[4319.98 → 4323.34] little bit are we going to talk about this at all, so there are a few things that make the new
[4323.34 → 4327.70] precision driver really exciting you guys can sing up for a notification we're going to have that link
[4327.70 → 4332.14] down below right Dan people can get a notification yeah i believe it's down there i will double-check
[4332.14 → 4337.30] though so there are a few things that i really love about this kit uh number one is the driver itself
[4337.30 → 4344.32] uh super, super high quality machined aluminum nice strong magnet in the end that's just kind of
[4344.32 → 4348.76] going to be if we're going to have a staple for our screwdriver products that's going to be it we've
[4348.76 → 4354.62] got in-handle bit storage i can hold three of our precision bits which use the standard shank size
[4354.62 → 4358.80] and are actually the standard length but with a twist I'll talk about that in a minute speaking of
[4358.80 → 4364.82] twisting it's got a high quality bearing on the top that will spin for anywhere from let's say you
[4364.82 → 4369.40] know what i don't want to promise too much let's say anywhere from 20 seconds to we've had them
[4369.40 → 4374.98] spinning for darn near a minute depending on how you get them going it's going to be yeah there's a
[4374.98 → 4379.22] lot of there's a bit of finesse to it there 's's some variance in the bearings there's a lot
[4379.22 → 4383.96] of stuff going on uh we're going to have accessories including uh different tops so you can have a
[4383.96 → 4389.14] concave top if you like the finger hold we're going to have a convex top if you like to palm it and then
[4389.14 → 4392.74] by default it's going to ship with the flat top, but you'll be able to get top kits and
[4392.74 → 4397.44] who knows what kinds of tops we might have available for it in the future that's the driver
[4397.44 → 4405.42] itself then there's the kit super high quality case comes with a detachable top that you can use
[4405.42 → 4411.58] as a parts tray includes a sheet magnet inside along with little organizer spaces for the stuff that
[4411.58 → 4417.00] you're taking out of it there you go there's one of our bits in there and okay that is probably the
[4417.00 → 4422.72] worst bit you could have possibly put onto there for my next point our bits are also pretty exciting
[4422.74 → 4429.24] even though they are the same length that you would find from um well let's say you know other
[4429.24 → 4435.82] bit dang it other bit manufacturers that we respect a lot one of the things that we changed was the depth
[4435.82 → 4445.88] of the um uh the hex portion so you can see it drops into our driver there, and she's a little
[4445.88 → 4450.94] she's a little longer in the skinny part one of the issues that I've had with many of the precision
[4450.94 → 4456.82] drivers that I've used in the past is that they aren't deep enough to reach into in some cases like
[4456.82 → 4464.76] almost anything yeah um depending on the bits so we're really excited for these to be not super deep
[4464.76 → 4468.92] i mean they're still not a fixed shaft screwdriver you know you're going to need a fixed shaft screwdriver
[4468.92 → 4473.92] sometimes, and we're working on solutions for that, but they are a little bit deeper making the
[4473.92 → 4481.70] multi-bit a little bit more usable um and i guess that's all i have to say about that is there any
[4481.70 → 4487.84] other like major points that i missed here anodized aluminum end cap is interchangeable hybrid sine
[4487.84 → 4495.24] high ceramic hybrid bearing uh incredibly strong magnet yeah yeah oh, oh yeah right the driver will be
[4495.24 → 4500.94] available by itself if you already have an fixity kit uh we love fixity they're a great partner we love
[4500.94 → 4506.90] their mission we're not we're not trying to replace fixity we certainly never will I was just
[4506.90 → 4512.90] going to say no like all the replacement parts all the guides but we uh we're real passionate about
[4512.90 → 4517.94] screwdrivers really high-end tools um and we really love this thing comes with 61 different bits
[4517.94 → 4523.86] standard Phillips specialized bits for game consoles all kinds of different ones and i think that's pretty
[4523.86 → 4529.72] much all i have to say about that for right now so i said what time is the pop-up oh right uh okay so
[4529.72 → 4537.00] it'll be next saturday, September 7th from 10 a.m to 2 p.m at the Linus media group studio in surrey
[4537.00 → 4542.52] wait is that the studio or the lab yeah i was told studio okay so it'll be at the studio um
[4542.52 → 4549.60] now it's not raining this might be kind of exciting or whatever but do not travel far for this event
[4549.60 → 4555.54] why we didn't give you very much notice this will not be like Ltd or whale land um we will have some
[4555.54 → 4560.92] testing stations for you to like try out the product um you'll have uh you'll have an opportunity
[4560.92 → 4564.90] to talk to some of our design and engineering folks about how we develop our tools and products
[4564.90 → 4571.58] um there might be a few other things um but don't travel we literally don't have enough capacity
[4571.58 → 4576.54] for a ton of people to be here and everyone's just going to have a bad time if people are trekking
[4576.54 → 4586.08] out here from like wherever i stand um, so please don't uh yeah okay cool oh right there's a couple
[4586.08 → 4592.20] of other things for the store uh scribe drivers um the pen are now available to order again uh if you
[4592.20 → 4596.54] missed out on the last two drops, or you're looking to buy more you can secure yours on backorder at
[4596.54 → 4602.18] leg.GG slash pen uh so that's a good candidate if you guys want to send a merch message today i still
[4602.18 → 4607.98] haven't even been able to get one you don't have one yet no wow get wrecked scrub i tried to buy them
[4607.98 → 4615.92] in the last wave i couldn't get it fast enough i want to like do you want me to put a request in
[4615.92 → 4623.32] for you right now it's fine it's fine well okay this is not a rule etc etc etc i don't like putting
[4623.32 → 4629.34] in merch requests when customers can't get them so if the thing is perpetually sold out it's very
[4629.34 → 4635.74] noble of you proof literally took a small break from the shoot that we were doing together sat on
[4635.74 → 4640.48] his laptop ordered one and then came back and i was like what were you doing he's like ordering a scribe
[4640.48 → 4650.24] driver i was like really yeah so i want it to like be able to exist on the store for more than you
[4650.24 → 4655.04] know a couple of days and then I'll try to get one i mean you got keys in your head of instructor you
[4655.04 → 4660.00] could just turn off the cameras in 107 and just go grab a handful
[4660.00 → 4667.56] that's really smart you can't joke about that that's really smart you can't even joke about that
[4667.56 → 4672.40] it's just he's a smart guy yeah it's not like there's like massive amounts of logs and all of
[4672.40 → 4676.84] us get emails all the time if anybody would try to do something like that yeah it would be pretty
[4676.84 → 4684.56] obvious yeah um okay last couple things people in full plane chat are like grab me one
[4684.56 → 4693.80] i mean you could just do it with a Barrington i got you family oh man um last announcement is we are
[4693.80 → 4700.58] resuming our sponsor partnership with Asus uh we stopped working with them on January 5th of this
[4700.58 → 4706.82] year due to issues that we were seeing um through our community feedback team or through our community
[4706.84 → 4712.82] feedback mechanisms on the forum um i got oh, oh look at this Asus timeline what is this
[4712.82 → 4721.14] oh wow Colton put together a little document for me uh so in 2022 late 2022 we saw the first Asus
[4721.14 → 4728.42] complaints on the forum in um second quarter of 2023 we saw a detailed post about someone having
[4728.42 → 4735.22] issues with Asus support um followed shortly by some more issues and an influx of complaints
[4735.22 → 4741.72] regarding Asus like GPU mobs with display issues in early May of that year we told Asus that if
[4741.72 → 4745.38] we didn't see improvements or if they didn't do anything to address complaints we'd have to consider
[4745.38 → 4753.38] pausing partnership um so that was within a month of this sort of influx of complaints um
[4753.38 → 4762.26] in may 2020 what year are we in 2023 uh on the wan show i said that Asus was in the doghouse
[4762.26 → 4767.94] and that we were in talks about shoring up customer support uh with them um there's also a call to
[4767.94 → 4773.86] action in the segment encouraging people to go to the forum with their complaints um in August
[4773.86 → 4782.26] uh we let's see hold on we reiterate we're sharing the complaints the process takes time oh yeah okay
[4782.26 → 4786.36] yeah in August we posted regarding the large amount of complaints that we'd been receiving since early May
[4786.36 → 4794.04] we reiterate we're sharing the complaints in September um we were told that Asus had an action plan coming
[4794.04 → 4797.16] for how they wanted to change their processes we share with the forum that this is coming
[4797.80 → 4803.56] in December we went through the entire forum history and compiled a list of all sponsor complaints from 34
[4803.56 → 4808.68] different users and sent this to Asus we flagged the ones that were valid complaints that needed
[4808.68 → 4815.48] resolutions asap in also in December we had a call with Asus to go over each issue one by one and share what
[4815.48 → 4820.36] we thought the resolutions should look like in mid-December we posted our weekly forum update
[4821.00 → 4825.24] uh in January we announced that Asus would no longer be a sponsor of LTT
[4826.20 → 4830.76] in March we made a thread on the forum to assist with people needing RMA as it's still pinned
[4830.76 → 4836.28] in April we worked with Asus to audit people's issues we realized a few were still outstanding
[4836.28 → 4845.32] uh, so this is in 2024 now um in June um Colton and i actually met with Asus's CEO i don't think
[4845.32 → 4852.68] we've ever addressed this publicly um, but we sat down directly face to face with their CEO um i laid out
[4853.32 → 4860.76] what i needed to see happening with the ongoing issue with the SD card in the rogue ally i laid out what i
[4860.76 → 4867.32] needed to see happen because this was around the launch of the ally 2 or ally x excuse me um i laid
[4867.32 → 4878.52] out what um philosophically i felt was an underlying problem at Asus i sort of i spoke to some of the
[4878.52 → 4884.60] issues that i could see um that i could have empathy with um what i saw from speaking with him was
[4884.60 → 4892.20] someone who was told yes sir um when things weren't getting done and i told him i can
[4892.20 → 4899.88] empathize with that and i felt that what they needed was an improvement in upward communication um
[4899.88 → 4906.28] an ability for people to raise these issues in a way that would make it so that he wasn't blind sided
[4906.28 → 4911.56] by it because it's one of those things where you can kind of you can bash someone for what went wrong
[4912.12 → 4917.00] but i don't feel that that's actually the most effective way to enact change i think it's far
[4917.00 → 4921.96] more important to empathize with them and to try to figure out what went wrong because it was clear
[4921.96 → 4930.84] to me from speaking with him that he didn't want Asus to suck at all he wanted it to be great and so
[4930.84 → 4937.88] i was like okay well here's an issue um one of the other things that i outlined as being very important
[4937.88 → 4945.56] was I felt that Asus still had a very 2000s mentality sometimes fix it with a revision
[4945.56 → 4951.48] was something that i told him that i felt Asus had embraced for a lot of its history and that was
[4951.48 → 4958.84] a big part of Asus's success for a long time was to move fast and break things um and i was like look
[4959.48 → 4964.28] you guys are a grown-up company now and i think that's something that needs to change
[4964.28 → 4973.24] he seemed extremely receptive to everything that we talked about um so far we have actually seen
[4973.24 → 4980.36] very little in the way of overall activity around Asus support issues um you know one of the ones that
[4980.36 → 4986.36] i saw the person was outraged because there was a credit card hold for an advance RMA that's
[4986.92 → 4992.68] standard practice there's a credit card hold when you get an advance RMA so advance RMA is um is when
[4992.68 → 4996.76] they send you the new product, and they're waiting to receive, and then they're waiting to receive the
[4996.76 → 5001.16] old broken one back, and then they take the hold off the credit card that is completely normal and you
[5001.16 → 5007.96] need to chill um in fact offering advance RMA at all is like perfect i love advance RMA because then
[5007.96 → 5015.56] i don't have to have downtime if something's like kind of working so um we felt perfect about
[5015.56 → 5022.84] that things seem to be going okay and if anyone needs you know help to find the correct channels
[5022.84 → 5029.16] of support from Asus we still do have a topic here so you guys can check this out I'm going to post this
[5029.16 → 5034.84] in the float plane chat maybe uh Dan if you can chuck that in uh in some of the other chats um but we
[5034.84 → 5040.52] think we've we've seen enough that we're ready to work with them again but nothing's permanent
[5040.52 → 5052.04] right like we have begun and ended relationships with industry giants time and time
[5052.04 → 5057.96] and time again i mean NVIDIA has repaired them NVIDIA is a hilarious one right because they went from
[5057.96 → 5065.32] you know working together to not working together for a long time 24 to working together extremely
[5065.32 → 5073.08] closely to not working together for two years because we called them out to working
[5073.08 → 5076.68] together with them again we're working with them now we don't agree with everything they do but
[5076.68 → 5085.88] you're not going to get a lot done um from the outside people leave mentalities change yeah
[5085.88 → 5091.64] mentalities shift i mean i do think that NVIDIA has a bit of a chip on their shoulder from the top down
[5091.64 → 5093.00] sure i mean i
[5095.64 → 5102.92] i would not criticize Jensen's business acumen when you have to ask that nice of an oven
[5102.92 → 5107.56] you've got to be a shark to some or his knowledge everyone I've ever spoken to from NVIDIA is like
[5107.56 → 5112.76] the scariest thing about Jensen is that he thinks he can do your job better than you can and he probably
[5112.76 → 5118.12] can, and he's right yeah he'll walk in like two seconds and solve something that you've been spending
[5118.12 → 5125.56] a week on, and it's like that'd be terrifying you know that kind of pressure um, but it's very clear that
[5125.56 → 5135.00] NVIDIA is for out for NVIDIA first that's all that's all I'll say about that um so anyway I've got some
[5135.00 → 5142.04] questions about the screwdriver really quick oh yeah um that is what is the cost of things um what
[5142.04 → 5146.76] is the cost of the screwdriver itself what is the cost of the case with the bits and all that kind of
[5146.76 → 5151.40] stuff and what is the cost of the combo kit do we know any of that look at this face you don't know
[5151.40 → 5156.52] any of that does this look like a face that knows no okay all right i actually don't know can we
[5156.52 → 5161.80] figure that out um because i think they're it's public info isn't it at least for the screwdriver
[5161.80 → 5169.32] itself it is 8 13 everybodys I'm not messaging anybody right now all right yeah well i could
[5169.32 → 5174.52] i could call nick but uh i don't need i don't need to call nick for that I'm sure you will figure it out
[5174.52 → 5179.00] you'll figure it out oh i mean when it's out you'll know yeah exactly, exactly I'm not going to bother
[5179.00 → 5186.52] someone if it just like doesn't matter that much yeah uh okay Nick's gonna call in three no phone
[5186.52 → 5191.88] might be dead actually no, no no it's still got two percent i got a lot of teams messages oh no I'm
[5191.88 → 5195.80] kidding oh do you want to do another merch message before we move on i think we're supposed to right
[5195.80 → 5202.28] additional topics 10 minutes ago was that all the announcements there was a lot of them this week
[5202.28 → 5207.24] i have to make sure that you get through them all, or we get hit we get assaulted
[5207.96 → 5214.20] we did the pop-up event yeah yeah we're good we're good okay we have to be sure calm down boys
[5214.20 → 5219.00] they'll beat us with sticks they will not beat us with sticks they come out of the quarterly budget
[5219.00 → 5222.04] if they break us on us oh my god you have to
[5227.40 → 5233.08] you didn't use up your stick budget this quarter we're going to take it out of the fiscal report
[5233.08 → 5239.00] you know if we bought higher quality sticks then they wouldn't break us much no you know the price of sticks
[5242.60 → 5244.92] okay let's see they don't grow on trees
[5248.20 → 5255.08] yep that was my entire contribution to that bit and i ruined it i 100 ruined it you did too
[5255.08 → 5256.84] Avon fox branch manager
[5262.36 → 5265.24] oh okay let's see i can't even pick down
[5266.36 → 5266.60] uh
[5266.60 → 5272.68] uh hello and show how did the video game auctions god avid had an impressive collection
[5272.68 → 5282.04] oh i didn't ask him yeah i don't know i meant to ask him hopefully good probably good can we see
[5282.04 → 5286.68] okay that I'm not too bothered about just like asking someone okay I'll ask him I'll ask him I'll
[5286.68 → 5294.36] see if i hear back okay uh should I do another topic while you are you just calling him yeah give
[5294.36 → 5303.24] us one more Dan sure sure sure um let's see what piece of tech has the best value we've seen all the
[5303.24 → 5309.48] unique builds in your house but what do you value the most oh you value the most
[5309.48 → 5319.00] value is tough because like okay i was actually just talking to Yvonne today we were at the water
[5319.00 → 5325.72] slides and uh she was like oh are you going to leave your phone like at the like little tent
[5325.72 → 5330.60] site slash like blanket area i was like yeah i don't know she's like are you going to like cover
[5330.60 → 5335.88] it up I'm like oh sure like kick it under a blanket like i and i was telling her i actually
[5335.88 → 5340.52] love having a piece of crap phone that i don't have to care about yep this thing doesn't matter to
[5340.52 → 5348.04] me at all and i value that oh yeah absolutely so like what does value mean because you clearly said
[5348.04 → 5353.32] it's not money this is a mildly controversial part of the reason why i don't want a new car
[5355.00 → 5361.32] because it's broken in it's got the first scratch the 10th scratch 100th scratch
[5361.32 → 5367.24] if something it's more scratched than car I'll be sad if it like stops working but I'll just take
[5367.24 → 5372.20] to a mechanic if someone like bumps it i don't know i could probably get it fixed like I'm not
[5372.20 → 5376.20] super where it's a Honda effectively there's I'm sure there are parts, and they're probably not that
[5376.20 → 5381.96] expensive yeah like whatever it'll be fine yeah that's a very comfortable Luke's a bad driver I've
[5381.96 → 5387.32] never once been an accident in my life shut up no, no that's not the point like a scratch from like
[5388.04 → 5393.32] okay hold on I'm going to try and think of some of the hilarious no no no, no no, no yeah lean on it
[5393.32 → 5397.80] no I'm trying to think of some of the hilarious stuff you've had taking up the entire back seat of
[5397.80 → 5403.88] your car when I've gone to put my backpack in it okay no, no there's a good reason no, no he there
[5403.88 → 5410.04] he had this computer tower that had this like machined part that Jake made him in like high
[5410.04 → 5417.96] school or something it was back there for weeks months there was a water leak in my storage
[5417.96 → 5422.76] unit in my apartment so i effectively didn't have storage, so my car just like became storage right
[5422.76 → 5428.20] it's solved now so it's gone now my car is empty now really yeah i need a ride tonight so I'm gonna
[5428.20 → 5434.60] find out just how it is yeah it's actually like empty and that my friends is how you secure a ride home
[5434.60 → 5438.52] i noticed that because you had previously said you're gonna Uber but i mean i don't mind uh well
[5438.52 → 5446.76] no, no no, no no i no, no not home i meant from cultus from cultus lake when to get back here
[5447.72 → 5452.44] when are you going to call this i went today did you not notice me say i was at the water slides
[5452.44 → 5458.04] oh that no i was very focused he doesn't even listen to me and so much work for you
[5462.52 → 5470.04] uh anyway uh but yeah the car is the car is actually legitimately pretty clean at this point
[5470.76 → 5476.28] I'll be the judge of that sure all right yeah uh what are we talking about how it gets scratches but
[5476.28 → 5479.64] there 's's tons of ways because like if you're wearing jeans yeah like putting random
[5479.64 → 5484.04] he has so much stuff in it that too scratching things on the way in and out it has leather seats
[5484.04 → 5485.96] so for a while he's a friction boy i was
[5489.32 → 5493.32] uh for a while there i was worried about like you know putting something on the seats or whatever i
[5493.32 → 5498.44] would put like a blanket or a towel down or something try to protect the seat, and now it's
[5498.44 → 5503.48] like whatever dude yeah i don't know it was liberating spilling muriatic acid in my car
[5503.48 → 5507.64] right like it kind of sucks but at the same time you're like ah first one's out of the way yeah
[5507.64 → 5515.16] nothing's going to be worse than that yeah yeah i don't know like I've I've stored snowboards in my
[5515.16 → 5520.12] car now like yeah whatever at a certain point it's like i want to use it for what it's for
[5520.12 → 5525.96] yeah and not worry too much about all the little details yeah the friction is jeans part god i have
[5525.96 → 5531.32] never even gotten to the point there's the little like studs on your jeans that hold them together and
[5531.32 → 5535.64] if you lean against a car it could scratch the car i realized i thought you were going somewhere
[5535.64 → 5543.48] else entirely with that they've never popped off from the sheer size of my Luke you don't hold your
[5543.48 → 5554.28] jeans together sorry motion anyway we should probably move on oh my goodness we've got more sorry i thought
[5554.28 → 5562.52] there called stones we never answered their questions what do you value how did we get to that
[5562.52 → 5568.04] i don't know this is going so badly because you always bring it there I'll take that we start
[5568.04 → 5574.28] talking about your pants oh my goodness where did it go he takes it i can't
[5574.28 → 5586.20] oh no i don't know where the limit is so I'm going to keep my mouth shut uh what piece of tech has the
[5586.20 → 5596.28] best you really won't be able to whoa, whoa oh my face is starting to hurt my goodness mine too okay wow
[5596.28 → 5598.36] wow your face hurts
[5602.76 → 5606.60] is that like a weird nerve thing like where you kind of pinch here, but you feel it over here
[5612.76 → 5614.52] okay, okay okay
[5617.40 → 5623.24] was homoerotic vibes on the bingo part today i think that's the middle square
[5623.24 → 5625.56] should be the free one
[5629.32 → 5630.68] what is this stupid show
[5632.60 → 5637.32] most valuable piece of tech oh right right right okay so what do i value my NAS
[5638.92 → 5646.04] the NAS is the one i would save in a fire okay I'd try yeah, yeah good luck yeah um
[5646.04 → 5656.68] um oh man i have cloud backup of things i really care about now that you said the save in a fire
[5656.68 → 5662.60] thing like i wouldn't save any of my tech in a fire you wouldn't even take your phone if it's not
[5662.60 → 5666.92] already in my pocket yeah there's probably other things that's fair i have the birds i mean that
[5666.92 → 5673.96] figuratively you do not save anything in a fire unless it has a beating heart yeah yeah yeah but like i
[5673.96 → 5679.32] i mean even just like i don't know my phone i don't even like it yeah um i I'm not going to
[5679.32 → 5684.68] replace it because I'm too cheap but I'm not a fan of it so like whatever i if i can grab it on the
[5684.68 → 5691.64] way out sure it's just that I'm a little hurt right now why because that Bulbasaur computer was
[5691.64 → 5697.08] handcrafted by my children i would love you were not, and you would not choose that as your most valuable
[5697.08 → 5699.48] tech Charizard's going to win in this fight um
[5703.88 → 5709.00] it's so big and heavy, and it's like i I'd have to if i don't unplug it, it's going to be stuck I'm just
[5709.00 → 5710.52] waiting for him to bring up his Squirtle again
[5713.16 → 5720.12] got him oh CBN said what about your birds yeah that's essentially the problem right like yeah but
[5720.12 → 5724.76] how do you like save a bird in a fire like they don't have clipped wings they'll be dead literally
[5724.76 → 5728.60] I'd have to grab the cage and just run okay the cage as long as you have the cage then they have
[5728.60 → 5734.52] a chance out of the cage it's probably just over um if there's smoke, and they're out of the cage
[5734.52 → 5740.12] there are tricks to be able to catch them really um you have to make they have oddly enough i always
[5740.12 → 5745.32] thought the opposite for the longest time, but birds have at least budgies maybe this isn't true but oh
[5745.32 → 5749.88] interesting terrible night vision oh i thought you were going to say they're territorial no okay go ahead
[5749.88 → 5755.24] but owls have fantastic night vision as far as i know, but budgies have terrible night vision so if
[5755.24 → 5760.20] you just turn the lights low they can't see anything and i can just catch them oh i thought
[5760.20 → 5765.24] you meant like catch them outside no, no no, no no yeah if they get outside they're they're pretty gone
[5765.24 → 5771.88] yeah there are ways to catch them in that case, but that's like a process it's not yeah track dart
[5771.88 → 5779.80] dart no they would definitely die they're 30 grams they're the size of a tiny one
[5779.80 → 5784.04] obviously I'm not an idiot i think I've told i think I've told the story on Sancho but have I told you
[5784.04 → 5788.20] the story about how we were trying to catch that person's buddy that got out yeah i was walking
[5788.20 → 5793.32] around a park yeah yeah with a bird cage and a speaker playing bird noises looking absolutely insane
[5793.32 → 5798.20] yeah yeah yeah um yeah that's how you catch them because they hear other birds, and they're like okay
[5798.20 → 5803.72] that's good and then i see a cage like well that's where food often is right so I'll go there and then
[5803.72 → 5809.24] you just close the door nice, but then you have to figure out where the heck they are right so that
[5809.24 → 5817.40] can be rough put an air tag on it then it wouldn't fly away yeah that's true that's true hey oh speaking
[5817.40 → 5824.04] of pets uh we got two new cats yeah yep your arm is what i was pointing at oh yeah right i told the
[5824.04 → 5830.60] story last week yeah so how's that going great that they are super, super well socialized they
[5830.60 → 5836.12] are yeah on day one they were like scampering around climbing everything sitting in our laps
[5836.12 → 5840.20] couldn't believe it couldn't believe it the sitting your last part is pretty crazy yeah so are they
[5840.20 → 5848.12] integrating with the other cats at all here's Ivan day one wow yep just they are they be practically any
[5848.12 → 5855.88] animal baby that's chilling we put a little i found a cheap uh cat tree on Craigslist and our Facebook
[5855.88 → 5861.96] marketplace and just like put it in the bathroom where they're staying while we keep them isolated
[5861.96 → 5865.88] from the other cats yeah how long do you have to do oh they want to see show the class okay
[5865.88 → 5870.76] yeah here I'll send it I'll I'll uh I'll message it to dan how long do you have to do the isolation
[5870.76 → 5875.24] for we don't have to anything, but they have fleas, and we can't treat them for another three weeks
[5875.24 → 5881.56] and that also gives the other cats a little bit of time to kind of smell that something's going on
[5882.20 → 5887.96] and um it also gives these guys a little bit of time to get a little bigger, and you know stuff and
[5887.96 → 5894.52] stuff are they um you said they have fleas and there was a picture of Ivan sitting with them
[5895.08 → 5900.36] yeah so we're just you just watch take your clothes off wash them yeah do you yeah that makes sense um
[5900.36 → 5905.72] um, and realistically we're just going to have to like to treat everything after anyway so yeah yeah
[5905.72 → 5911.48] it is what it is yeah more over it yeah that's fair enough yeah birds usually do like a month
[5911.48 → 5919.40] even if there's no known issues just quarantine for a month yeah yep oh they're at the top of the dock
[5919.40 → 5924.20] oh okay i thought you were just going to put them up okay so all right here's uh here's my wife
[5924.20 → 5932.44] um I've managed to catch her not yawning is that cute or what that's pretty cute oh shoot
[5934.76 → 5935.80] leaked my wife's pussy
[5939.88 → 5947.88] that's the best one yet anyway uh here's them ridiculous are they cute or what oh yes
[5947.88 → 5956.84] they seem to be getting along quite well as well yeah that's good yep we'll see we'll see what the
[5956.84 → 5966.68] other cats think they have so many now yeah we're up to five that's that's like we're we're getting
[5966.68 → 5972.20] pretty close to crazy cat lady territory what is what is the line there oh i think is it five or
[5972.20 → 5977.96] you passed it like if you got one more are you now officially crazy cat lady we see it as a ratio
[5978.84 → 5984.84] we are a household of five people so you're we only actually have a one cat to one person ratio okay
[5984.84 → 5994.20] that doesn't seem that crazy if we had 15 cats well there'd need to be an intervention of some sort
[5995.96 → 6001.72] i don't know a lot of people have two cats yeah, but they have two people usually yeah you got five
[6001.72 → 6007.48] people there yeah that's ten cats yeah totally, totally reasonable so 10 i think 10 would be fine
[6007.48 → 6014.60] yeah pretty reasonable no yeah it's about the ratio Luke no i don't think it's okay i think it can
[6014.60 → 6019.64] be at least partially about the ratio, but it also has to be if you and i had two wives then it would
[6019.64 → 6028.12] be fine as long as there's two of us right so it's fine as long as between the two of us we don't
[6028.12 → 6034.76] have said six wives here in Canada anyway yes always doing the cult other than in bountiful
[6035.80 → 6041.96] yeah yeah it's like there's like a cult town in yeah in bc we're not really sure how that works no
[6041.96 → 6043.16] we want to do the cult town
[6045.56 → 6049.72] Linus tech town only YouTube it's not me LTT line's check down yeah it's already named
[6051.32 → 6056.04] it's already named what about second husband and then the and then where we do the uh where we do the
[6056.04 → 6062.60] bizarre experimentation on people could be LTT labs perfect it writes itself yeah
[6063.72 → 6069.08] it's that's actually that's amazing yeah i love it um we'll all eat blue oysters
[6072.36 → 6079.00] that's pretty good it's not good it's pretty good it was pretty good it took me a second i was like oh
[6079.00 → 6085.16] yeah that is a thing um speaking of things that are oh yeah a thing uh sponsors the show is brought to
[6085.16 → 6093.88] you today by MSI school season is starting soon oh look at your time to god that's not a real picture
[6094.44 → 6101.56] yeah it is well not the face no the face has been altered pretty notably um the hair not so much
[6101.56 → 6107.40] yeah yeah i was actually wearing overalls like that what does the shirt say walking restraining order
[6107.40 → 6115.88] waiting to happen don't worry about it, i liked funny shirts from warehouse one i did the same thing

[6343.40 → 6349.48] uh what else what else we got going on here today what do you want to talk about um
[6350.52 → 6356.28] i think we have another title topic which one was it oh yeah a new version of windows unlocks crazy
[6356.28 → 6362.20] rise and performance boost yeah early tests of AMD's uh branch prediction improvements in the upcoming
[6362.20 → 6368.60] 23 h2 version of Windows 11 show significant performance jumps in most games hardware lux
[6368.60 → 6375.40] found improvements between 13 and 41 for Starfield wow for all the dozens of people playing that game
[6375.40 → 6383.88] still great job this one's maybe a little better four to 61 for cyberpunk this is a huge delta um and
[6383.88 → 6392.20] roughly 10 to roughly 20 improvements for f1 2024 uh depending on CPU hardware unboxed found a two to
[6392.20 → 6398.68] four percent improvement in Halo Infinite but a 30 percent uh 30 plus percent improvement for gears 5
[6398.68 → 6404.28] and 13 percent improvement for Tom Clancy's rainbow six siege hardware unbox also found similar numbers
[6404.28 → 6412.04] to hardware lux for f1 uh 24 go check those videos out for more information um Microsoft has also
[6412.04 → 6418.84] backported these improvements into an optional update for the current version of windows oh that's exciting as
[6418.84 → 6427.88] well excellent so um yeah great work keep it up uh maybe next time you know at launch would be better
[6427.88 → 6432.20] yeah wait for that update letting everybody know you're using an admit account, and you know stuff like
[6432.20 → 6440.20] that yeah perfect that'd be nice um what else we got this week um there were a lot of people calling on me
[6440.20 → 6451.56] to how do i put this to kind of do a takedown of um hold on let me just uh i want to actually bring up the
[6452.36 → 6457.72] the topics' doc because i actually wrote some of my own thoughts in there and i they didn't necessarily
[6457.72 → 6464.28] make their way into the doc itself, so there were people particularly on Reddit calling on
[6464.28 → 6472.20] me to do like a takedown of Austin Evans's video on the framework 13. He published a review yesterday
[6472.20 → 6480.20] um talking about a lot of the downsides of the hyper repairable modular laptop uh investment
[6480.20 → 6486.92] disclosure I'm invested in framework um some of the downsides he identified were the relatively high
[6486.92 → 6493.00] price for the performance uh construction compromises for the sake of modularity the genericness of the
[6493.00 → 6497.40] keyboard um there's actually some stuff he talked about that isn't necessarily in my notes here he
[6497.40 → 6510.36] talked about um the lag for framework to have the latest processors um but I guess what I'm sort of
[6510.36 → 6519.88] trying to ask is why would I be doing a takedown of his video his conclusion was that essentially it
[6519.88 → 6525.32] wasn't for him, he didn't see the value of it and this ties directly back into the same thing
[6525.32 → 6531.08] that I've been complaining about which is not all reviewer people need to agree with each other and
[6531.08 → 6539.00] that's okay um Austin doesn't need to agree with your take if it's even different from your, but that's
[6539.00 → 6544.92] the thing is I don't even think he did if you watch the whole video and if you listen it's 20 minutes long
[6544.92 → 6551.00] like it's long and if you listen to everything he says he talks a lot about the positive things as
[6551.00 → 6557.88] well it's actually pretty balanced um and I think actually the lot of the negative he's getting
[6558.60 → 6564.20] roasted for it seems like it and I think a lot of the negativity toward the video actually demonstrates
[6564.20 → 6569.40] what a good job he did of outlining the compelling things about the framework and particularly the
[6569.40 → 6574.20] framework 13 because everyone who watched his video disagrees with his conclusion because he
[6574.20 → 6580.04] actually did a really great job of outlining everything that's perfect about it um there
[6580.04 → 6584.92] are a there are a couple of things that you know if I was to have a private conversation with him, I might
[6584.92 → 6591.96] say yeah here's you know something here's an alternate perspective or whatever else but i I don't know it was
[6593.40 → 6599.24] it was kind of disheartening for me um to see the people who were looking for some kind of drama or
[6599.24 → 6605.48] showdown between me and Austin there won't be there shouldn't be he gave his opinion he didn't make it
[6605.48 → 6613.64] personal nothing he said was personal everything he said was his opinion based on his time his experience
[6613.64 → 6620.52] with the product um, and he has different priorities I saw a couple of people criticizing the laptop that he
[6620.52 → 6625.56] compared it to saying that it wasn't a like for like the one that he found for half the price that
[6625.56 → 6630.76] had the same processor in it or whatever else and you know what that's fair but Austin's priorities
[6631.80 → 6638.84] might not be those things that are better about the framework 13 and I think you'd have to be a
[6638.84 → 6644.84] complete fanboy you'd have to be deluded to look at the framework 13 and say it's the best value laptop
[6644.84 → 6649.96] we don't even use them internally here and there's a variety of reasons for that a lot of our folks prefer
[6649.96 → 6654.36] touchscreen framework still doesn't have a touchscreen option that's feedback I've been giving them on an
[6654.36 → 6661.96] ongoing basis um the cost is not necessarily the most competitive for what the spec is there are
[6661.96 → 6666.28] departments where we have at least considered rolling them out and the ability to upgrade them
[6666.28 → 6671.40] over time is a key part of that the ability the ease with which you can get replacement parts is a key
[6671.40 → 6678.36] part of that, but it's not going to be perfect for every environment and guys investment or no investment
[6678.36 → 6686.20] I would never tell you that it's the perfect thing for every environment like look the second that i
[6686.20 → 6691.40] turn into a framework salesman you should stop buying frameworks, and you should stop watching LTT
[6691.40 → 6699.08] that hasn't happened, and it never will, it's ridiculous um yeah like what's uh hold on i saw a comment
[6699.08 → 6705.24] from someone that was like it felt like I think it was crystal it felt like he missed the point but he
[6705.24 → 6712.12] didn't he outlined the point really well he actually talked in detail about the point and about the
[6712.12 → 6721.48] benefits and i I don't agree with his conclusion which is fine yeah which is totally fine but what I do
[6721.48 → 6729.96] respect is the way that he outlined both sides before he presented his conclusion giving you an opportunity to
[6729.96 → 6735.16] to be armed with the facts and decide if you agree with him or not I don't know
[6737.32 → 6746.76] i uh I'm just so I'm so done with everybody having to agree and if we disagree not being able to do
[6746.76 → 6748.20] it in a manner that is respectful
[6751.08 → 6758.28] yeah you should get multiple perspectives I have always said that and the only perspective that I won't
[6758.28 → 6765.00] accept is the perspective that you don't need multiple perspectives there is no one truth there
[6765.00 → 6773.40] is no one answer it is never that simple you could look at the best benchmarks taken in the most scientific
[6773.40 → 6780.36] manner but if the most important thing to you is turning on all the eye candy with a bunch of mods
[6781.00 → 6786.36] those benchmarks are never going to be the most relevant thing to you because in the interest of
[6786.36 → 6793.80] repeatability they can never use those mods it's never black and white literally never
[6795.72 → 6803.40] just I'm tired of it man tired of if it's really frustrating uh speaking of frustrating Ubisoft patch
[6803.40 → 6810.12] resets player progress for Star Wars outlaws several hours after the launch of the paid three-day early
[6810.12 → 6816.12] access for Star Wars outlaws Ubisoft sent PS5 players an email telling them to install a day one
[6816.12 → 6821.88] patch that's a weird way of communicating that but sure uh the patch fixes some potentially game breaking
[6821.88 → 6827.72] bugs such as one that could lead to the player being forever stranded in space, but it also requires
[6827.72 → 6836.12] players to restart from a new save oof according to Ubisoft pre-patch save files will face issues and
[6836.12 → 6843.72] progression blockers um as compensation Ubisoft is giving these players an in-game cosmetic called a trailblazer
[6843.72 → 6850.12] trinket and 100 Ubisoft connect units is that a belly button ring or what
[6852.12 → 6858.12] what kind of trail be blazing no idea it says aka loyalty points oh my god get some treasure
[6858.12 → 6867.40] oh my goodness uh it says aka loyalty points I don't know what connect units are or whatever I have no
[6867.40 → 6873.56] idea uh the deluxe editions that include this three-day early access period cost 40 to 60 dollars on top
[6873.56 → 6883.00] of the price of the base game um some players lost 15 hours of play time okay so here's my thing
[6883.00 → 6886.04] save data
[6889.72 → 6893.08] should be compensated at like
[6894.36 → 6901.88] dude yeah the first time I did it wasn't work it was play it's definitely going to feel like work
[6901.88 → 6906.52] the second time it's definitely worked the second time a lot of probably this is one of the things
[6906.52 → 6910.28] that makes me so angry about Nintendo just they do a lot of things that are really great they make
[6910.28 → 6917.64] great games I'm going to keep giving them my money like but the way that they hold your save data hostage
[6918.84 → 6926.84] if you don't buy their online subscription is actually like i I can't make an argument for why
[6926.84 → 6933.16] it should be criminal but I wish it was yeah it's the fact that you can't back up that save data in any
[6933.16 → 6942.12] other way just so angry and so looking at this the fact that people had to pay extra to have to do
[6942.12 → 6949.88] work essentially doing QA for Ubisoft a multi-billion dollar company i just I can't, I can't abide it
[6949.88 → 6956.28] I speaking of this is a little off-topic but um in the realm of how you were like yeah Nintendo's
[6956.84 → 6960.52] makes some great stuff i they make really frustrating other things but I'll just keep giving
[6960.52 → 6966.68] them my money because they make great games uh mr dank pods over there has a video his most
[6966.68 → 6974.52] recent video it's called it's time to change it's time for Linux, and he basically talks in this video
[6974.52 → 6980.04] what year is it watch it yourself what year is it the year of Linux desktop is it the year is it the
[6980.04 → 6985.48] year of Linux desktop it's its I've got a story video go ahead it's its a great video it
[6985.48 → 6991.80] has half a million views already um we're not going to watch it, although it is you know this
[6991.80 → 6996.68] type of stuff uh, but you should go watch it yourself even if you're not going to switch to Linux honestly
[6996.68 → 7001.64] I think it's just a really I mean he's been doing this for a long time he's perfect at if it's a
[7001.64 → 7008.20] very good video um, but he talks about a lot of like good stuff, and he talks about how like people have
[7008.20 → 7012.92] flamed him for switching to Linux, but then he talks about how those same people are the people that say
[7012.92 → 7016.92] you should like vote with your wallet on things, and he's unhappy with what's happening with
[7016.92 → 7021.32] macOS, and he's unhappy with what's happening with windows he talked about how like you buy this
[7021.32 → 7026.52] operating system then you get ads in it which yeah that's ridiculous I tried to install an unsigned
[7026.52 → 7032.52] driver on macOS that was for like I had to clear like four or five different prompts dig into the
[7032.52 → 7037.72] settings in order to yeah it was wild yeah I was trying to get an old printer working and
[7037.72 → 7042.68] actually this was where I was going to get into year of Linux one of the things that is still
[7042.76 → 7049.96] just very difficult with Linux was we needed a Linux desktop like quick because we were just
[7049.96 → 7055.64] trying to see if like this old printer would work with it and I was like a steam deck I'll just grab
[7055.64 → 7062.04] a steam deck that's like the closest at hand machine, and you just reboot it in desktop mode it
[7062.04 → 7066.28] doesn't even reboot I don't think it just switches it fires up the desktop environment and
[7066.28 → 7074.84] valve didn't include any of the printer stuff because why would they I guess on a game console
[7074.84 → 7080.12] except that it's supposedly a desktop computer, and it's just completely not there, and it's like you
[7080.12 → 7085.00] could get it, but it's going to be annoying yeah he talks in the video about how there's every time I touch
[7085.00 → 7090.92] if it's just okay yeah side quest he talks about that it's like if Frodo had to put the ring in
[7090.92 → 7097.80] mount doom okay, but first he had to go play World of Warcraft harvest a bunch of pigs, and then he had
[7097.80 → 7105.00] to go you know get the in-game gold and get it on an USB and personally deliver it to freaking like you
[7105.00 → 7109.08] could argue there's some side questing in Lord of the Rings okay you could argue that there 's's a
[7109.08 → 7114.68] fair amount okay it's like he had to put the ring in the mount doom, but first he had to go and fight
[7114.68 → 7120.28] the wraith ring wraiths I don't know I never read the book, and he had to talk to tom Boabdil which
[7120.28 → 7125.64] is where I stopped reading fellowship of the ring every single time yeah that's it he had to talk to
[7125.64 → 7133.40] tom Boabdil the actually scariest character in the whole book dude the guy's deranged uh but yeah
[7133.40 → 7138.92] anyway every time I tried to read that book like three or four times can't get past it and I'm
[7138.92 → 7142.92] not the kind of person who can just skip yeah and I don't think there will ever be an abridged
[7143.80 → 7148.76] Lord of the Rings has someone done it has they actually published and I'm going to look it up i
[7148.76 → 7152.84] feel like a bridged fellowship of the rings before we get completely version I'm not counting that
[7152.84 → 7155.88] whether you're interested in Linux or not honestly I'll go watch the video I think it's perfect
[7157.08 → 7160.92] I think it's I think it's extremely based for consumers to just
[7161.80 → 7167.32] not buy into things that they actually really hate um so I strongly support what he's doing
[7168.92 → 7172.20] this is so pompous
[7177.88 → 7183.24] it is not possible even at great length to pot the Lord of the Rings in a paragraph or two
[7183.96 → 7189.88] it was begun in 1936 and every part has been written many times hardly a word in its 600 000 or
[7189.88 → 7196.12] more has been unconsidered and the pacing style size and contribution to the whole of all the features
[7196.12 → 7199.00] incidents in chapters has been laboriously pondered
[7201.16 → 7202.68] you could have bridged the Lord of the Rings
[7204.92 → 7213.40] uh yeah DRAC ray in full plane chat said abridged LOTR or yeah LOTR is the movies yeah I guess
[7213.40 → 7218.12] just kind of true but the books are still why didn't they just take the birds
[7218.12 → 7224.36] that's the abridged one oh we just go on the big crow and then just drop it in from the sky and then
[7225.08 → 7227.40] woo we saved the hobbles
[7229.16 → 7234.76] the hobbles there you go lord of the 30 minutes short
[7236.44 → 7242.76] zap rosewater says those are Tolkien's words I know that doesn't make them not pompous yeah
[7242.76 → 7253.32] I carefully hold on what's the hold on what's the line my use of that word was laboriously
[7253.32 → 7253.88] pondered
[7258.12 → 7262.84] oh man anyway i kind of respect it though I don't think you should abridge it
[7264.20 → 7271.80] um if you can't stomach bomb Boabdil tom Boabdil you can't stomach tom Boabdil just whatever just move on
[7273.40 → 7278.28] it's part of the damage yeah but I don't damage i just I want someone else to do the work for me
[7278.28 → 7282.36] I don't want to have to skim I don't want to skim to see when the boring part is over like leave
[7282.36 → 7286.84] I want the important parts I don't want to have to wade through the slop in order to get like an
[7286.84 → 7290.76] interesting conversation that takes place or something I think if you're really trying to
[7290.76 → 7299.48] understand the actual, and he was actually very into this um as someone who has read the Silmarillion and
[7299.48 → 7304.92] uh what is it called the sons of Huron or whatever it's called and all the other books
[7304.92 → 7309.32] uh I think he's trying to help you understand the world and understanding tom Boabdil does
[7309.32 → 7312.44] help with understanding the oh my god I'm so bored listening to you right now
[7312.44 → 7319.00] is out of place you're so tedious right now because you actually look more tired oh yeah
[7320.92 → 7322.68] oh yeah 100 yeah
[7322.68 → 7328.04] uh anyway uh where are we commenting yeah
[7331.88 → 7337.32] you probably can like does Goodreads have a comment section good reads
[7337.32 → 7339.08] hello try
[7342.52 → 7344.52] it has votes does it have comments
[7348.84 → 7355.00] uh there are reviews they're reviews not comments there are comments on the reviews there we
[7355.00 → 7363.96] go cliff's notes oh no let's go no let's go oh easy-peasy next the two towers let's go
[7363.96 → 7371.40] band of orcs capture Mary and pippin kills bar mere yeah Marion spoiler alert uh although treated
[7371.40 → 7375.16] roughly by the orcs Mary and pippin remain unharmed, and they're here I'm attacked the hobbits run to
[7375.16 → 7378.44] safety the forest yep yeah this seems pretty good okay you know what I'm just going to go with this i
[7378.44 → 7383.56] don't need to read the books now to be clear I'm a reader I actually am a reader i have I
[7383.56 → 7389.56] have read you know thick books and stuff it's not that I'm incapable of thick books I've read thick
[7389.56 → 7395.00] books and stuff I just can't get through tom Boabdil it's insufferable I've read thick books and i
[7395.00 → 7401.96] can't be fictitious I can't be fictitious yeah wait and i no cap what are you even saying yeah that
[7401.96 → 7407.72] basically all right um yeah I read the thickest books um
[7411.16 → 7415.16] yes I've considered skipping him that's what Luke tells me to do every time no someone should help
[7415.16 → 7420.60] someone should have to look that that's not my point is just that it's not that I am
[7420.60 → 7427.00] I don't have the attention span to read tom Boabdil is uh is a difficult section of the book
[7427.88 → 7435.00] it's really stupid between that and the unending descriptions of mountains I'm just like
[7437.00 → 7442.20] if I want to know what a mountain looks like I will literally just open my door and walk outside
[7442.20 → 7450.76] and touch grass I have mountains right there some people don't but i don't need that book for
[7450.76 → 7456.12] them oh so now we're hating on mountains' no I love hot dogs and hamburgers
[7458.20 → 7462.84] I like hamburger patties that are made of hot dog meat I'm going to wait no I don't think anyone would
[7462.84 → 7470.68] like that would that be would that be good that's not a hamburger patty sausage patty
[7470.68 → 7476.84] a sausage patty and also hot dog meat is not sausage is awful hot dog is a whole other
[7476.84 → 7483.00] level pork patties hot dogs made of ground beef okay hold on what are we even
[7483.00 → 7488.68] breakfast sausage did we just did we just invent food I think we might have just invented food
[7491.80 → 7497.40] I think we invented a food I think I'm going to go hike into the mountains and read lord of the
[7497.40 → 7500.92] rings in the mountains so I can read descriptions of mountains while on a mountain you're totally not
[7500.92 → 7505.32] going to do that probably not but I am going for a hike on Monday but anyway you're not going to take
[7505.32 → 7509.96] Lord of the Rings with you that'd be so that'd be so lame yeah that'd be so lame you wouldn't be able
[7509.96 → 7519.96] to hike on the mountain oh man you've been you've been on one today you've been good I'm spicy today you've been
[7519.96 → 7534.12] quick with those um police using AI to write reports um that's dumb axon formerly known as taser
[7534.12 → 7535.32] international is
[7539.80 → 7549.00] is selling soft company ink axon axon axon is selling software to law enforcement that uses AI to create
[7549.00 → 7555.16] draft police reports from body cam footage called draft one notably they're also the dominant vendor
[7555.16 → 7560.28] for police body cameras in the United States at least some police departments such as the Oklahoma
[7560.28 → 7565.96] city police are already using draft one the software is only intended to create a draft that
[7565.96 → 7570.60] an officer can then review and edit into a final report there's no way this could go wrong both
[7570.60 → 7575.48] because the AI is not 100 reliable and also because an officer who testifies in court needs to
[7575.48 → 7579.32] be consistent with written accounts authored under their name yeah they can't just read it before
[7579.32 → 7585.80] they go to court yeah happen let's see how this goes it'll surely not be terrible guaranteed to be
[7585.80 → 7592.92] terrible it'll surely not be terrible what a joke oh people suck so wait where did my where did my
[7592.92 → 7597.24] note on this go what happened to my notes on this what notes on what oh wait hold on what did I not
[7597.24 → 7606.20] have notes on this maybe I had notes on something else um no oh, oh man I was missing one of my
[7606.20 → 7611.96] perfect notes on something the non-tech shutting down thing I had wanted to talk about how one of the
[7611.96 → 7626.68] big challenges is um that there's no money in you know the the the the the the written media format that a non-tech so yeah
[7626.68 → 7631.24] relies on anyone I think it's also that the the the techie space is a higher percentage of ad block
[7631.24 → 7639.80] users ad block hits things like uh static web ads kind of the hardest uh there's no money there I know
[7639.80 → 7647.96] there 's's review sites of more Norrie things that do a lot better and lower ad tech is gonna basically
[7647.96 → 7655.24] tech is going to eat its own tail by you know automating things to death and i was like
[7655.24 → 7661.00] reminded of that when I saw this uh post on r slash hardware about our snapdragon for a month challenge
[7661.00 → 7669.16] where someone used an AI generated summary to basically there save you 18 minutes, and it's like
[7669.16 → 7679.40] you realize that an AI can't use these laptops in a real world situation um and then report on that
[7679.40 → 7684.28] unless someone is actually doing the work um like it's
[7688.76 → 7690.60] yep good luck everybody yep
[7693.24 → 7700.12] it's its super it's that that that's a weird community yeah it's its super weird the uh
[7700.12 → 7708.28] uh yeah how sort of tentative and scared people have to be to say I thought it was a good video
[7708.76 → 7717.48] there man the tribalism is uh it's an it's a whole thing anyway good luck everybody uh nice hash
[7718.12 → 7723.16] according to multiple reports online crypto broker nice hash has sent out an email announcing they'll be
[7723.16 → 7729.56] charging a six dollar a month service fee to users with inactive accounts starting on October 1st
[7729.56 → 7734.44] according to the email users can avoid this service fee by simply engaging in an activity on the
[7734.44 → 7740.60] platform such as buying or selling crypto it does not mention account deactivation as an option but many
[7740.60 → 7747.32] have rushed to do so regardless I guarantee I know why they're doing this they also implemented a series
[7747.32 → 7753.72] of other fees including ten dollars to change your account's email address look at this
[7757.08 → 7762.20] so um reset to fa 10 bucks recover account 10 bucks seriously 10 bucks
[7763.48 → 7768.12] okay you said you know why they're doing this other than just being okay this part I don't know
[7768.12 → 7773.40] the previous part I thought it was just because they probably had a lot of stagnant accounts from
[7773.40 → 7779.16] like the absolute peak of GPU mining, and they're sitting there with all these stagnant accounts
[7779.16 → 7784.20] that have bitcoin sitting in them oh, and they want to just slowly drain these out from people that are
[7784.20 → 7791.00] not paying attention to their accounts even if hey you know maybe i kind of sort of forgot about
[7791.00 → 7796.04] that account because it only had like 10 bucks in it, I did this over like a few weeks with my GPU and
[7796.04 → 7801.96] then sort of forgot it existed over time and yeah 10 bucks would be nice, but it wasn't impactful enough
[7801.96 → 7809.16] that i sort of forgot about it, you can drain that out, but you do that to 10 000 100 000 a million
[7809.16 → 7815.88] now it starts being a big deal so you can just but I don't know extremely highly monetizing their
[7815.88 → 7822.28] customer support was not a curveball I expected to come right after that so now I don't know well anyway
[7822.28 → 7827.16] we don't work with them any more uh we did one sponsored video with them back when they seemed pretty
[7827.16 → 7832.20] chill it blew up anyway yeah people were mad about it and hey yeah maybe they're maybe they're
[7832.20 → 7837.24] a**holes so great I'm glad we stopped working with them yeah like this one line the monthly service fee
[7837.24 → 7843.00] for inactive accounts yeah I suspect they're just you know if you're going to ignore it we're going to drain it
[7843.00 → 7848.44] which isn't a good thing but I understand why they're doing it the FBI is bad at shredding hard
[7848.44 → 7853.72] drives apparently this seemed a lot more interesting when I was first reading it but yeah basically government
[7853.72 → 7862.76] not do things properly sometimes and this is really exciting man there's been so much good like pro labour
[7863.32 → 7870.52] news lately and like pro you know like regular people news there's been some bad news uh like there
[7870.52 → 7875.24] was the Canadian government mandating the rail workers back to work that was not super cool but
[7875.24 → 7881.08] this is super cool uh following a year-long investigation the U.S. national labour relations board
[7881.08 → 7886.36] has found that Amazon is a joint employer of subcontracted drivers that work for its partner
[7886.36 → 7893.16] companies in palm dale California Amazon's refusal than to negotiate with their currently striking union
[7893.16 → 7900.28] was thereby determined to be illegal the company was likewise determined to have made unlawful threats I have
[7900.28 → 7908.68] no idea what the actual impact will be on Amazon, but this is sick being able to just hire
[7908.68 → 7918.68] a firm that can be spun up and closed down or uh contracted and not contracted at on a whim being able to
[7918.68 → 7925.80] hide behind that and essentially not have to pay people living wages and not have to treat them properly
[7925.80 → 7932.92] is such a broken loophole in I was going to say the American system but as far as I can tell it's like
[7932.92 → 7946.52] basically a lot of places and it's gross and this is far from a death blow, but this is a is a good start so let's let's do away with that
[7947.40 → 7952.60] at least one person checked their nice hash account because of that thing and found 150 bucks
[7952.60 → 7960.68] so maybe go check your nice hash account yeah go check your nice hash account to get the money out of
[7960.68 → 7965.24] there and then run away like back when it was cool it was actually pretty convenient and pretty cool which
[7965.24 → 7972.52] is why we worked with them yeah definitely get your money out before they take it found like four dollars
[7972.52 → 7982.28] and fifty cents nice 40 bucks 15 bucks someone said a lot somewhere I don't know what it was like a few hundred
[7982.60 → 7990.20] oh all right anyway all good you're good oh yeah okay it's time for one show after dark oh
[7990.60 → 7991.08] very nice
[7994.60 → 8000.92] I'll take him a second oh yeah Dan's on this man what's I going to talk about you know I lived here
[8000.92 → 8007.00] my whole life I had never been to the cultist lake water slides really never not once have you been
[8007.00 → 8013.88] have you done the 72-foot drop one uh is it super new I don't know if it's not super new then yes
[8013.88 → 8020.52] because I had it's basically like a vertical drop yeah they had uh they had kind of two that were sort
[8020.52 → 8025.64] of like that one of them was the tandem the wavy one yeah there's no tandem they only have one on the
[8025.64 → 8031.72] wavy one now no I mean sorry uh it was still a really steep drop, but it was the bowl oh no not that
[8031.72 → 8038.84] oh man we put my dad my brother and i all in one tube and did the bowl and my dad was able to touch
[8038.84 → 8045.72] the lip on the other side we got so much it was awesome
[8048.52 → 8055.48] we used to go and call this all the time um yeah it was good all right anyway yeah no I've never been
[8055.48 → 8060.68] so finally went um yeah yeah it was good it was pretty good yeah it's fun yeah um
[8062.52 → 8068.52] let's see what else is new oh wait 170 bucks people just keep chiming in like they find a
[8068.52 → 8073.24] bunch of money in their yeah go get that money yeah get some money zero but if it's not hey you
[8073.24 → 8078.04] got something spend it on LTT store woo that's cool I don't believe that one yeah well I mean you never
[8078.04 → 8085.24] know some people are pretty bro-y yeah you own any crypto right now no yeah I got nothing I'm out
[8085.24 → 8090.04] dude yeah I get it I'm there's been a bunch of times when I've called it and I like could have
[8090.04 → 8095.80] made money but i just at this point in time I just don't want to follow it exactly I don't want to put
[8095.80 → 8100.76] the effort in I'm sure if I did I could make some money but I don't other things like I don't like
[8100.76 → 8107.08] remember my passcodes on my like ledger it's also just like another job basically yeah i just
[8108.84 → 8114.84] I just don't care anymore I think I'm out yeah and like it's you know which exchange is the one
[8114.84 → 8120.12] that's like probably going to disappear and take all your money this time I've got a buddy that you
[8120.12 → 8124.36] know but oh yeah I'm not going to name yeah that's super into it and has made
[8127.08 → 8135.64] oh yeah disgusting money oh yeah and continues to be honest doing great oh yeah proud of the boy
[8135.64 → 8141.64] but it's yeah he pours a lot of work into it yeah it's his job that's what he does yeah so it's like
[8141.64 → 8145.88] okay cool but I don't want to do that I'm doing other stuff so it is what it is we all got our
[8145.88 → 8155.24] things i 5k nice hash not even joking completely forgot BTC was like 15k back then oh nice sick
[8155.24 → 8160.92] yeah good for you, I guess that makes sense if it wasn't necessarily super valuable back then yeah but
[8160.92 → 8166.84] it's gone up a huge amount yeah it's its sitting pretty good right now okay yeah so like 359.71
[8166.84 → 8174.76] cents in my nice hash don't forget hey don't forget who reminded you lttstore.com full point

[8205.00 → 8211.56] to tell me you'll have to remind me nope um and as part of doing that there are some things

[8219.88 → 8225.16] shipping so even without giving away some of his cool pieces or not giving away but even without
[8225.16 → 8231.08] auctioning some of his cool pieces he's still way up on what he spent on his collection okay so he is up

[8270.52 → 8275.08] you're on a Friday in life are important, and your partner needs to understand that yeah why didn't
[8275.08 → 8280.36] you put it on like a screen there you were on the streak now you're off the streak yeah weak yeah
[8281.72 → 8287.16] you're not a streak anymore you're a stain on this show yeah on this institution I'll suggest you
[8287.16 → 8295.32] let that marinate okay sorry what was the oh okay right what's your favourite memory from your wedding
[8295.32 → 8301.00] we were just busy berating you oh I'm sorry why are you two divorcing each other oh you missed
[8301.00 → 8309.32] Sancho he missed Sancho I can't live with this man he's intolerable ever since oh okay hold on we're
[8309.32 → 8314.28] going to come back to this for a second uh you had me put letter Kenny on my Plex server yeah
[8314.28 → 8320.68] I watched a few episodes I didn't think you'd get it at all I never suggested you watch it
[8321.24 → 8326.84] I just wanted to watch it um okay yeah you didn't think I'd get it I mean there's an entire episode
[8326.84 → 8331.88] about fart jokes I didn't think you'd necessarily people sharing their farts with each other wait you've
[8331.88 → 8338.60] watched that far you like it, I want I've watched three episodes I can't tell if it's like stupid
[8338.60 → 8344.04] funny or just stupid like i just i it's actually great what I think you might
[8344.04 → 8349.96] legitimately like more is shorty uh-huh okay yeah I didn't suggest you watch this at all people
[8349.96 → 8354.92] said fart book is the worst episode well that's good because it's not very good fart book was pretty
[8354.92 → 8362.04] rough okay it's like super campy just some like dudes in Canada doing what they can shorty is
[8362.92 → 8370.52] shorty is better in my opinion yeah okay a lot of people are like I like letter Kenny but
[8370.52 → 8375.08] shorty's better the shorty's far superior to letter Kenny if you're going to watch one of them watch
[8375.08 → 8383.56] shorty all right yeah okay anyway um but i didn't recommend you watch either yeah i I'm just
[8383.56 → 8391.96] yeah I'm just yeah i for me letter Kenny was side monitor content okay that was funny sometimes okay
[8391.96 → 8397.16] shorty's like actually pretty good okay all right um so favourite memory from my wedding
[8398.92 → 8402.52] um it's hard to pick one Luke wasn't there so
[8404.60 → 8410.04] oh um no, no he that's not because he is like missed it we did he didn't know me yet um
[8410.60 → 8414.76] favourite memory from my wedding yeah I met you like right afterwards I think like
[8414.76 → 8422.20] man how do I pick favourite it's hard there's its such an emotional day it's such a roller coaster
[8422.20 → 8428.36] you know like everything was chaos we were late for our own um I think that's surprisingly
[8428.36 → 8433.96] common uh yeah well like the reception I think you're saying no not the reception the like
[8433.96 → 8439.24] the actual ceremony like we were we were slightly late for its everyone was like already seated and
[8439.24 → 8444.36] like ready to go, and we rolled in because like our wedding day shoot ran a little bit late and like
[8445.16 → 8452.52] um the weather was incredible like we got married in late April, and we did that because it was
[8452.52 → 8459.72] cheaper um because as long as you're not in may the rates are way lower because the chances of the
[8459.72 → 8464.04] weather were in Vancouver so the chances of the weather being good in April are hit or miss and the
[8464.04 → 8470.36] whole day was on and off showers, but it was like the skies cleared every time we needed to be outside
[8471.00 → 8475.64] and then it rained the second we needed to go inside like it was actually kind of magical that's
[8475.64 → 8481.56] cool um like it was sprinkling, and then we had our outdoor ceremony and then as people were heading
[8481.56 → 8485.48] inside it started sprinkling again it was like wow this is incredible, and then it was clear for our
[8485.48 → 8491.96] shoot in the morning which was also outside um like the whole thing was just kind of incredible um you
[8491.96 → 8497.72] know obviously there's like you know the moment you know the wings, and she's walking
[8497.72 → 8501.96] up the aisle, and we had bubbled everyone in the audience had like bubble blowers, so there's
[8501.96 → 8504.60] like bubbles everywhere which was really cool um
[8508.04 → 8510.60] Ivan tearing up the dance floor was definitely a highlight
[8512.28 → 8512.92] that has to be
[8512.92 → 8520.28] um that's the Ivan that used to work here we were colleagues at NCI before he worked here um
[8522.52 → 8523.32] just the like
[8525.48 → 8531.32] breathing afterwards when it was over I could see that kind of going I think we threw a perfect
[8531.32 → 8536.92] party you know I could see that um because it's kind of like it was the first thing we accomplished
[8536.92 → 8543.72] as a married couple sure was to throw a hell of a party as kind of the way that we saw it because
[8543.72 → 8550.20] um Ivan had like an emotional breakdown in the lead up to the wedding realizing that she had
[8550.20 → 8554.60] completely lost control over like you know what do you mean we're doing it this way what do you mean
[8554.60 → 8559.96] we have this now why are people i I understand the desire to contribute but I actually didn't want
[8559.96 → 8566.84] that there don't bring it here and like and I basically was like Hun it's not about you
[8567.56 → 8576.84] like yes this is your wedding, but this is, but your mom is marrying her first daughter yeah if there's
[8576.84 → 8581.48] it's for there are other stakeholders because she was like I don't even know a lot of these people
[8581.48 → 8585.32] that are there just like you know like a lot of yeahs a lot of really tough stuff so it was basically
[8585.32 → 8592.92] like look here's the deal let's just go with the flow and what we're going to do is on our honeymoon
[8592.92 → 8598.12] we're going to take our wedding finery, and we're just going to what about second ceremony
[8599.00 → 8603.16] with just you and me and a witness, and we'll like we'll have someone over we'll do the
[8603.16 → 8608.84] cool photo we'll do the donkey ride through the town we'll do a new we'll do a new wedding photo shoot
[8608.84 → 8613.56] we'll do well we're just it's not going to have any legal significance or anything we'll sing the
[8613.56 → 8623.48] documents at home obviously but if that will allow us to just detach from this and just have fun with
[8623.48 → 8629.80] whatever it is and lose control a little bit of the details and then and then it won't matter if
[8631.08 → 8636.76] you know the the the don't have enough cake or if we or if someone isn't able to
[8636.76 → 8643.56] or if we don't, we never got to eat the food we just we had so many people there because
[8643.56 → 8648.36] our families wanted to invite people that we didn't even know, but we went around, and you know
[8648.36 → 8653.24] had face time with everyone which back then meant seeing people face to face not using your phone um
[8654.60 → 8656.60] so we we we were able to
[8659.24 → 8666.68] just throw a party and enjoy everyone else enjoying it and us enjoying that and enjoying parts
[8666.68 → 8671.08] ourselves and like there was stuff that we just weren't that into like some of the first dance
[8671.08 → 8675.56] stuff, and you know that other people it was really important to other people for tradition and stuff
[8675.56 → 8681.64] and then so before we had this sort of frame of mind change that was causing a lot of stress
[8682.28 → 8691.00] and I was like look the worst thing for this day is for it to cause stress oh yeah that is not what
[8691.00 → 8697.64] anybody will benefit from and I think the approach of like we'll just do it how you want
[8698.20 → 8703.40] on our own sort of version of it thing if you can afford to do that I think that's super sick
[8703.40 → 8709.40] because then yeah I think it helps release some of the pent-up like because some people they wait for
[8709.40 → 8717.08] that for their entire life so like if anything is slightly off they're going to go crazy over it so being
[8717.08 → 8721.56] else to let go of that is cool crystal says yikes shouldn't a wedding be about the couple
[8721.56 → 8728.68] sure in theory in practice the world is never that clean yeah it's just not that clean
[8729.40 → 8733.96] and at a certain point, and you can fight for that because sure enough that's true, but you can
[8733.96 → 8738.92] fight for that, but it's going to be a fight yeah, and you can have lines like you, you can absolutely
[8738.92 → 8749.16] have boundaries but at the end of the day are you willing to damage a relationship over it what is
[8749.16 → 8757.56] a wedding maybe depends on the thing yeah but is it worth it depends on the thing that's the question
[8757.56 → 8763.16] you got to ask yourself yeah you got to ask yourself is it worth it I'm trying to think of my brother's
[8763.16 → 8769.08] wedding my brother's wedding went fantastically well but I can think of a range of things that
[8769.08 → 8773.40] could have happened that i I probably would have like shielded him from needing to burn bridges but
[8773.40 → 8781.16] I would have burnt bridges with ferocity and like it's just if you know if certain things happen
[8782.60 → 8786.04] you have to distend there's that boundary line that you're talking about, but there 's's some
[8786.04 → 8791.32] amount of flexibility that you can have as well yeah I mean and to be clear like you know we were lucky
[8791.32 → 8795.72] we didn't have anyone get totally wasted and say something completely inappropriate or whatever
[8795.72 → 8800.52] like it was never it was nothing like that it was just preference things and so you gotta
[8800.52 → 8808.20] ask yourself is my preference really worth this fight does it actually really matter you might also
[8808.20 → 8813.56] at the exact same time that that's happening start questioning why this thing with that person would
[8813.56 → 8819.08] need to be a fight, and you can kind of like strategically reposition these relationships as you go but
[8819.08 → 8823.48] it might not be worth having that battle, but you have to kind of keep in mind that that person brought
[8823.48 → 8829.48] it to that point trouble but love it my wife and I eloped a few months before the wedding because we'd
[8829.48 → 8833.64] already lost so much control to her parents who were paying for it, we went into our big wedding then
[8833.64 → 8838.76] with so little stress because at that point it was just a regular party with a little recreation at
[8838.76 → 8842.92] the beginning that's cool and if you play your cards right there's some recreation at the end too
[8842.92 → 8849.32] yeah that's cool um I like that yeah
[8853.72 → 8863.48] sup LTT live in a closet guy here again nice I bought psvr2 as for content consumption without a PS5
[8863.48 → 8869.32] minus have you tried psvr2 on pc, yet thoughts also is merch messages end-to-end encrypted
[8869.32 → 8877.32] I give them we're going to read them out I think it's irrelevant but um what kind of I think they're
[8877.32 → 8883.32] just asking silly questions am I a chat I'll come here I'm sure you can answer but yeah my quantum
[8883.32 → 8890.60] computer safe um I haven't any I haven't tried psvr2 on pc yet i I probably should play around with it but
[8890.60 → 8897.08] um yeah it's its an it's a good headset the fact that you need the adapter kind of harms the value
[8897.08 → 8902.60] of the price a little bit i kind of wish you didn't, but it seems like a pretty good play it
[8902.60 → 8907.24] seems like a pretty good play I didn't get it insomniac in chat pointed it out he's Memling on
[8907.24 → 8914.12] the telegram subject yeah yeah I didn't yeah I was like what was immediately ready to defend his
[8914.12 → 8922.20] platform hard week we can make it worse he's had a hard week we can make it worse there's still time
[8922.20 → 8929.16] it'll be fine okay let's see uh hey Luke and Dan as an in fas infrastructure guys are there any
[8929.16 → 8934.92] benefits to my job's work from home practice of having us remote into pcs on our desk at the office
[8934.92 → 8945.56] instead of virtualized pcs on the company servers uh if they are relatively unsophisticated then there
[8945.56 → 8953.56] could be if everything is set up properly there should be no reason that you can't just use your
[8953.56 → 8960.92] system at home and like a like and remote into a virtualized pc from there yeah it depends on
[8960.92 → 8966.28] the security level of the things you're dealing with and sometimes, sometimes like if it's dumb and
[8966.28 → 8973.72] it works it's not dumb and if they're just if everything is just set up, and then they just don't
[8973.72 → 8977.48] have to change anything and don't have to figure anything out if you just remote into your workstation
[8980.92 → 8985.32] yeah it's probably fine again though it depends on the security level of the things you're dealing
[8985.32 → 8994.44] with um editing video is like sure okay do whatever yeah pretty much, but there's like there 's's
[8994.44 → 9003.08] other things that wouldn't be good yeah sinus lake and man you have talked about poor search engine
[9003.08 → 9008.12] algorithm functions recently your thoughts on YouTube shadow suppressing a video and claiming
[9008.12 → 9014.20] the algorithm any way to prove or disprove this sure I can prove it when one of the Paul brothers I forget
[9014.20 → 9022.60] which one because they're both the same to me um made the suicide forest video and yeah was it sure um
[9023.48 → 9028.76] and YouTube claimed that they weren't suppressing the channel, but they like definitely were
[9028.76 → 9034.44] because you could search for exactly the name of the channel, and it would be below the fold um there
[9034.44 → 9040.76] I proved it yeah that was pretty wild there was absolutely no way that that wasn't a thing yeah
[9042.04 → 9049.88] yep so they definitely can do that so okay cool uh hey what happened to the thing at the top
[9049.88 → 9055.72] of the merch message dashboard what about it did I leak it too many times, and now it doesn't exist
[9055.72 → 9059.88] anymore no, no it's under partner spots you've minimized one down you probably minimized oh stats
[9059.88 → 9065.88] there it is I accidentally minimized it oh wow you guys pre-ordered a lot of scribe drivers I've just
[9065.88 → 9074.76] been I've been curious all show i they're going to be gone again um I don't know another 10 000 of
[9074.76 → 9081.64] them I don't know man last time what they lasted three days well yeah, but surely there's a surely
[9081.64 → 9087.16] there's a limit to the number of pens people need like some number what could it be here hold on let
[9087.16 → 9094.20] me see if I can write it down on your arm oh that was not that easy to get off even
[9096.84 → 9103.96] and I had to i had to explain it just like the neck tattoos I forgot it was there and I never like
[9103.96 → 9112.52] warned Emma so she was like um what I think she'd be used to it by now sink plane says in her defence
[9112.52 → 9118.52] it wasn't like she was mad she was just like what's happening more weird stuff okay yeah yeah
[9118.52 → 9125.24] sink plane says please stop selling prime in your venting machines guys I said in the video they're
[9125.24 → 9130.28] they're just they're they were just in there for testing I don't know where they came from probably
[9130.28 → 9133.96] they just like someone who works there who doesn't even know who the Paul brothers are
[9133.96 → 9140.12] grabbed a bunch of random beverages don't worry about if it's fine also they didn't taste that bad
[9140.12 → 9141.88] i tried them they were not bad but the
[9144.84 → 9152.12] Luke is there anything in your fridge or freezer from nestle no then stop what not a single thing
[9153.72 → 9157.64] he's lying its impossible
[9160.28 → 9163.24] maybe that I didn't buy
[9165.80 → 9167.32] here we go
[9170.68 → 9179.56] anything from any of these brands so far no, no arrowhead crackers nope oh no arrowroot I was
[9179.56 → 9180.84] thinking of arrow I'm looking to
[9180.84 → 9190.76] with this baby I'm not going to have that one okay I'm not going to have bottled water uh go to the go to
[9190.76 → 9198.36] the cereal section really quick it's top right uh nope none of those okay all right I'm safe too
[9198.36 → 9204.44] any of this now is this all candy bars because just no okay all right is it all candy bars yeah okay so
[9204.44 → 9207.96] none of those we got I don't drink coffee okay hold on go to this
[9209.64 → 9214.20] did you all know no I don't have any of that stuff well i I don't know anything from Libby's I didn't
[9214.20 → 9220.36] know Maggie was owned by nestle jeez you want to know the cheat code to this why I'm pretty sure I'm
[9220.36 → 9229.00] right why chicken rice yeah that's fine and uh yeah but Maggie's like a seasoning it's like msg and brown
[9229.00 → 9233.80] oh seasoning that's going to be I don't I mean that's what was astounding that particular
[9234.36 → 9239.88] keep going I don't have meal replacements this looks like miller replacements okay all right healthier and
[9239.88 → 9247.72] healthier and healthier and ice cream okay pet care no oh anything from purina for me, I think
[9248.84 → 9254.60] I didn't know that was nestle i uh I got Purana one but no yeah cool I'm throwing that out and the
[9254.60 → 9262.04] cat because it's touched nestling now new cat oh my goodness my ruined it my point is just that
[9262.04 → 9269.24] if you're gonna if you're going to be like no you can't no problem isn't even who it's supporting sure
[9269.24 → 9277.56] my problem is that it has hydration claims that are not based on the ingredients not good sure yeah
[9277.56 → 9282.12] I didn't say it was good for you, I said it tastes good yeah I'm sure it probably does it just doesn't
[9282.12 → 9285.64] really do the thing that it's trying to sure publicly accomplish yeah that's fair enough I mean
[9285.64 → 9291.16] that's my only like trade should we carry trade actually I think trade is pretty good it has a
[9291.16 → 9297.32] lot of sugar in it, but it does have a significant amount of hydration stuff in it is has good salts and
[9297.32 → 9304.44] and things now who are they Pepsi I don't know this Powerade is Pepsi I think trade is
[9304.44 → 9312.04] PepsiCo and like it's a Powerade so many uh of so many food brands are like so bad I'm not trying to
[9312.04 → 9317.88] take that stance I'm there's no part of me that's like Logan Paul is more evil than nestle or whatever
[9317.88 → 9323.56] else I don't care about that that's that's whatever um wait how do you even know about the prime in the uh
[9323.56 → 9330.20] in the in oh how what how do they how do they know about the I have no idea what how did what's
[9330.20 → 9333.80] going on here video or a picture or something it's in a video that's coming out I think it's a picture

[9446.20 → 9453.00] message oh yeah hit me hey d to the LL in terms of scalability do you see wan show growing bigger
[9453.00 → 9458.44] with other hosts or production value or do you enjoy it being just the three of you no it's uh
[9459.48 → 9468.36] it's i i i I can't think of a production at Linus media group that has gotten less support for
[9468.36 → 9473.64] expanding from me than the wan show it's all held together back here with rubber bands and paper look at
[9473.64 → 9483.32] our set like seriously it's its not good it's a wall there are so many wrinkles on this I don't even
[9483.32 → 9489.00] I'm not even talking about the quality of the wall I'm just like you look at the go watch five seconds
[9489.00 → 9493.88] of the yard and then come back I don't know this view looks great look at the space we dedicate that's
[9493.88 → 9501.32] sick dude he's got a human organ bag behind him and then and then we go to the Linus's oh second wall
[9503.40 → 9505.56] hold on what about random merch
[9509.08 → 9515.56] there boom nice there's that blurry decoration blurry merch uh
[9515.56 → 9521.40] I just go between it as you poured too much production value into when it would get significantly worse
[9522.60 → 9528.60] yeah I feel that very strongly I support Luke's viewpoint because I don't want to spend anything
[9528.60 → 9534.28] on when yeah but also like dude if you try to make the like the new sections more
[9534.28 → 9540.36] structured or even more planned out it's just going to get worse yeah people want it to go off the rails
[9540.36 → 9547.64] people like it being fun oh including me speaking of off rails you guys were noticing this last week
[9547.64 → 9557.80] I have some bad news um there's a little line in if it's so minute um you're probably not going to be
[9557.80 → 9564.60] able to see it but basically where the plastic flows in uh where's the gate on this uh piece of
[9564.60 → 9568.44] the mould I think it's actually at the bottom with the gate so oh sorry well the gate is where the
[9568.44 → 9573.96] plastic shoots into the mould um I think it's on this side anyway the point is that where the plastic
[9573.96 → 9580.52] flows and meets on the flat of the screwdriver there's a little line that looks like a scratch
[9580.52 → 9586.04] down the two of the three flat sides and the only reason it doesn't show on the one flat side is
[9586.04 → 9590.36] because that's where uh the two halves of the mould meet, so there's already a line there's already
[9590.36 → 9594.52] a seam, but it basically just looks like a little scratch here and a little scratch here but the
[9594.52 → 9600.20] problem is that the scratch goes all the way through uh so you can never get rid of if it's there
[9600.68 → 9606.04] and it just looks like it's scratched out of the box and that's why transparent screwdriver is uh
[9607.56 → 9611.88] um not dead but certainly not happening anytime soon
[9614.28 → 9622.60] it looks really cool yeah I wouldn't mind the little line, but the problem is we can say that and
[9622.60 → 9630.68] Wang chat can say that yeah and then some users going to get it and see the line and RMA it and then
[9630.68 → 9634.52] we're going to say no we had it disclaimed on the product page, and they're going to say but what about
[9634.52 → 9640.04] the trust me bro guarantee and I'm gonna not want to deal with that yep, so product doesn't get released
[9640.04 → 9647.08] yep that's how it goes hey Landis missed the days of needing a PCI card for everything because I could have
[9647.08 → 9653.00] a cool computer with all the gadgets nice where can I get that nowadays what else has that nerdy
[9653.00 → 9658.52] customization energy framework laptop investment disclosure old cars you can get all kinds of cool
[9658.52 → 9664.44] like uh modules and stuff whether you need them or not I don't know well it's up to you but uh you
[9664.44 → 9672.28] can definitely get them what else has that get a modular and then not be able to afford anything ever again
[9672.28 → 9685.40] you're supposed to use it for the work, and you're supposed to bill people properly for the work so
[9685.40 → 9689.72] that you can afford the modular synth it's supposed to be a return on investment you didn't buy music
[9689.72 → 9696.76] from me, you don't know how much that costs okay do you bill those hours a lot more than you tried to
[9696.76 → 9706.36] bill me you bought a service okay yeah, but it's it all comes down to hours Dan it all comes down to
[9706.36 → 9713.96] hours and expertise you have to bill the hours appropriate for the level of expertise and for
[9713.96 → 9723.72] the and for this fight still going on because this Dan hasn't internalized that he lost yet that he lost
[9723.72 → 9728.92] yeah because you have to account for the sporadic ness of the work so the level of expertise
[9728.92 → 9732.76] and how feast and famine it is you got to account for that you got to have smoothing
[9733.88 → 9741.24] in your billing you got to smooth over the parts where it's the famine with the feast and the cats to
[9741.24 → 9747.08] protect the granary that's why I have so many of them this is good advice you should uh if you do
[9747.08 → 9753.08] freelance listen to this I know that's true I can't tell if he's mocking me or not if no I'm not
[9753.08 → 9757.64] I'm gonna look at his face I'm not mocking you keep the tone up and keep talking about this subject
[9757.64 → 9765.24] and then just sell courses dude I could make so much money selling courses infinite money dude it
[9765.24 → 9770.84] doesn't know offence it doesn't look that hard yeah I could do the music for them Colton's been trying
[9770.84 → 9779.40] to get me to do a course for literal years yeah literally yeah I keep telling him I'm like
[9779.40 → 9784.28] like nobody should buy a course from me everything that I am an expert on I should give away for free
[9784.28 → 9791.08] so I don't know i I give up, but then he always says no people would pay for it and I'm like yeah but
[9791.08 → 9797.24] like uh then it would have to be perfect I get I think that's part of it I get like anxiety
[9798.20 → 9802.36] like if it didn't have to if it could just be like generic nonsense but like with really high energy
[9802.36 → 9807.56] I could do that so easy oh yeah, but that's what most of them are I know that but i just i
[9807.56 → 9811.00] I couldn't take pride in that work no I'm not saying you should actually do it I'm saying if
[9811.00 → 9815.64] you did do it you'd rake in the cash dude you know what I would be the best at the right tone and stuff
[9815.64 → 9821.48] you know what I would be the best at is a televangelist oh yeah I could crush that so you're
[9821.48 → 9828.44] built for dude it's so easy I told you cult dude why won't you listen it looks so easy
[9828.44 → 9835.24] mind is tech town dude yeah you're you're you're basically just like a well well-kempt beggar
[9836.60 → 9844.36] and you just like you just man dude i went to church a lot of times in my life okay
[9845.64 → 9852.60] do you know how easy it is to just crack open that book read literally like two sentences I could total i
[9852.60 → 9856.84] could 100 you don't even have to do the work any more you can just pop it in ChatGPT just be like
[9856.84 → 9863.08] write a sermon about this because the message is usually only like five to ten minutes dude easy
[9863.08 → 9869.56] I could do it no problem I'm ready I wonder if pastors are using ChatGPT oh 100 100 probably no

[9881.56 → 9892.60] and this dude crazy nice yep um jesus.ai I'm afraid to click this but I'm going to do if it's just shrimp
[9892.60 → 9893.32] I'm clicking it
[9897.48 → 9904.28] yeah get out of there hmm not a good site don't go there yeah also you might be uh you might be banned
[9904.28 → 9907.64] now at least getting a little time out
[9911.72 → 9919.56] there yoiks don't go to that site hey LLD thoughts on computers going through the same fate as what GPUs
[9919.56 → 9926.92] did go from upgradable to upgradable and the backlash lunar lake is getting on not supporting
[9926.92 → 9930.04] upgradable you tweeted this at me, I literally replied to you
[9930.04 → 9937.16] they really liked their question I am sorry I don't read your twitter no, no no, no no that person
[9937.16 → 9942.76] i know no that well no I duplicated the message no the answer was that we made that video
[9943.40 → 9947.64] hold on hold well maybe they just want everyone to maybe they just want they think they have a great
[9947.64 → 9953.64] question they want it answered in front of more people um yeah so we made this we made this
[9953.64 → 9961.24] video the one and only uh Emily young here okay I just posted it in the chat um wish nothing but the
[9961.24 → 9967.24] best for her by the way so yeah we made this video build a pc while you still can they're changing
[9967.24 → 9972.68] whether we like it or not they're not going to be upgradable forever all right what's next
[9973.88 → 9980.20] when.dll with the FTC finally waking up to the monopolies of Google apple meta etc and the EU
[9980.20 → 9986.36] pushing for stronger regulation how does this end just more fines or is something bigger coming
[9986.36 → 9993.88] some breakups maybe um I mean which could be good yeah I think it could probably be a good thing if
[9993.88 → 9998.12] some of these tech giants were broken up apple's a funny one because it's a bit of a weird one
[9998.12 → 10003.64] though because they don't have that many products china's getting into the tech giant game yeah so and
[10003.64 → 10007.88] they're not going to break them up yep so if you break up all the American companies and make them less
[10007.88 → 10019.56] competitive that's a little weird it's a little weird um I'm not sure what to do there yeah because
[10019.56 → 10024.92] they're already going i it seems pretty clear to me at least that they're going with a
[10027.08 → 10031.48] a similar model to a lot of their other business where they're like we're pretty good, but we do
[10031.48 → 10036.60] everything, and we're cheaper so there it's its going to be a good decision for a lot of different companies
[10036.60 → 10044.92] companies um so if you break the other companies apart so they're less feature competitive
[10044.92 → 10050.28] and they're also still more expensive than yoiks that gets really rough
[10052.44 → 10058.92] hey Linus I'm opening an entertainment sports venue in October oh good for you, I'm curious what kinds of
[10058.92 → 10064.28] ideas you have for your badminton grand opening and if there's anything you really want to do but
[10064.28 → 10071.80] can't we're kind of going to keep it small I think um like we're at our capacity we're designed
[10071.80 → 10080.84] for like six times 14 like 28 times three yeah I don't know whatever that works out too so like 85
[10080.84 → 10088.68] people right so we don't want like 500 people there um no matter what kind of grand opening it is so
[10088.68 → 10095.64] we were kind of thinking like a hot dog barbecue in the parking lot like, and you can come check it
[10095.64 → 10098.76] out it's probably only hot dogs rated um
[10102.92 → 10105.72] I didn't say what kind of hot dogs they could have hamburger meat in them okay
[10108.84 → 10112.60] oh man that's pretty good sorry it was fast I'm sorry
[10112.60 → 10120.12] next up yeah so I think we're going to do a pretty we're going to do a pretty small thing so I don't
[10120.12 → 10126.36] really get rated I don't really have big plans yeah what about them um that's scary well they might
[10126.36 → 10133.00] just have to leave like we don't have any parking for like a bunch of people so it is what it is
[10133.00 → 10139.32] you might need to almost uh like security it and be like sorry too many beeps
[10139.32 → 10143.80] because I'm worried about the city's reaction if it gets a little out of control
[10144.44 → 10150.20] well theoretically they'll be there yeah we invited the mayor yeah so I'm worried about the city's
[10150.20 → 10151.56] reaction if it gets out of control
[10154.12 → 10161.56] i I'm honestly not that worried about it okay yeah don't show up if you're not going to like
[10162.44 → 10165.32] play badminton yeah it's for badminton that's it yeah
[10165.32 → 10177.24] hello when dot dill dot xc dot ping so many extra letters when Linus says something the community
[10177.24 → 10181.72] eventually comes around to his point of view how much of that is just him bringing attention to
[10181.72 → 10189.72] something nobody else has noticed a hundred percent both the warranty thing and the ad block piracy thing
[10189.72 → 10197.48] were a hundred percent just like this is i I still don't shoot the messenger the way that you packaged
[10197.48 → 10205.00] sure the warranty thing yeah I'm not denying it I did a bad job there's always you know you taught me about optics
[10205.00 → 10209.96] yeah optics on that were real bad yeah I did a bad job yeah what are you going to do about it
[10209.96 → 10214.68] nothing buy something from ltdstore.com I'm trying to buy the screwdriver or uh pen yeah
[10214.68 → 10223.72] look the thing is like I'm live here guys but driver guys I'm I'm live yeah the warranty one was
[10223.72 → 10230.44] persistent across a couple of events yeah but I was live every time that's probably fair enough and
[10230.44 → 10237.88] I'm not perfect and sometimes I'm sometimes i i i I'm in my own narrow viewpoint with the context that i
[10237.88 → 10243.00] have that other people don't necessarily have yeah and that I can't expect them to have, but that's pretty
[10243.00 → 10250.04] obvious to me like i I get it you've been making content for a long time there's a ridiculous
[10250.04 → 10255.56] amount of hours of your face on video sometimes things are going to be wrong yeah yeah I mean my
[10255.56 → 10260.60] favourite is I think my personal favourite is the time we did a wan show topic where a guy bought a
[10260.60 → 10268.20] house with bitcoin, and we were like yeah, but it'll never be used for anything real because it is didn't
[10268.20 → 10272.20] seem like it would the trans I mean even now the transaction costs are so high that it's
[10272.92 → 10283.24] woefully impractical but I mean people use it for stuff one day I'll find mine nice oh no 2009
[10283.80 → 10293.64] bitcoins or dollars or the year when I started oof 350 bitcoins somewhere in the world
[10293.64 → 10303.56] on a hard drive no way dude I started right at the beginning no way dude keeps me up at night
[10303.56 → 10309.40] sometimes 350 coins yeah something like that I mean they were like just coins back then you
[10309.40 → 10313.96] could just you know the there were hundreds in a block
[10313.96 → 10318.28] yikes this is a random number
[10321.56 → 10325.80] it's somewhere you have no idea where no
[10327.64 → 10334.12] how do you have no idea where it's 2009 so what I know where drives that I had in 2009 are I have
[10334.12 → 10340.60] checked all of them weird I mean they got written over oh so it's probably I have gone through all of
[10340.60 → 10348.76] them with like FBI grade recovery tools looking for blocks and things like that they're somewhere
[10350.28 → 10355.72] somewhere bummer one day they're probably on nice ash
[10358.60 → 10365.08] I should check probably uh okay probably not though couple more hey DLL Luke any advice on how to handle
[10365.08 → 10369.88] work when your natural workflow involves spikes of productivity, but management starts to expect
[10369.88 → 10377.72] consistent levels of productivity equal to your spikes that's pretty tough yeah um i uh
[10379.24 → 10386.44] I don't have any good advice for that I think I do your best be open and honest um that's all you
[10386.44 → 10393.32] can really do start a communication with your manager about overall resulting productivity not the
[10393.32 → 10423.00] productivity of every minute um and try to find trudge tasks like tasks that you know I don't know maybe your job is to do oh yeah good distraction tasks are good yeah like when you're distracted anyway yeah so like things that you can kind of just get through like maybe it's email maybe it's something else where like you know this is an annoying task anyway, and you know maybe you can be your mind is kind of somewhere else, but you'll, you'll feel yourself
[10423.00 → 10427.24] kind of click back in, and then you can get back to the main thing you're trying to work on like try to do
[10428.04 → 10435.88] something um even if it's not amazing um but yeah try to show your overall productivity over
[10435.88 → 10440.20] the course of a week or a month or whatever you want to use for your time frame um and show that you're still
[10440.20 → 10443.96] doing well and just explain you know my brain works a little different something like that
[10443.96 → 10455.24] this is the second message like this during this wan show go ahead Dan are you sure I mean I guess the
[10455.24 → 10463.00] second one it's the second one you didn't see the one in float plane chat no I didn't uh the only baby
[10463.00 → 10471.24] name my wife and I could somewhat agree on is for our second baby is Linus I promise it wasn't my idea does
[10471.24 → 10478.04] Linus give his blessing so just think about this it's slang for penis
[10481.32 → 10484.92] just seems like a pretty good name to me throwing that out there that's the case
[10485.64 → 10491.16] just line them up for success someone it's literally in like oceans 11 or something like
[10491.16 → 10495.72] Matt Damon refers to a penis as his Linus or something like that like it's this is actually a
[10495.72 → 10502.36] thing in an actual no no it is absolutely a thing I'm tired of arguing with you crystal um Linus i
[10502.36 → 10513.16] thank you for that that's great yeah so um just consider that it 100 is a thing and uh
[10514.44 → 10519.88] in response to the person in float plane chat earlier who said um you know I'm going to say that
[10519.88 → 10525.24] my kid is named after the Charlie Brown character can I at least give you guys an alternative okay
[10526.76 → 10537.64] go with this guy way more important than me okay if you must is you must name your child uh Linus okay
[10539.16 → 10547.56] two Nobel Prizes let's go okay there you go 1200 papers and books uh new scientists call them one of
[10547.56 → 10555.88] the 20 greatest scientists of all time this is apparently my namesake so let's all let's all
[10555.88 → 10560.76] just remember who the original Linus is actually I think it's a biblical name hold on
[10563.32 → 10565.00] uh not an important character
[10566.68 → 10571.16] uh pope line oh yeah there's pope lines no, no it goes farther back than that
[10572.04 → 10576.12] uh I looked it up and found a Reddit thread from 11 years ago
[10576.12 → 10581.96] um about this um and hilariously enough people are talking about you in it
[10583.64 → 10587.96] you seem to be urban dictionary also says it
[10590.84 → 10591.40] what is this
[10592.92 → 10597.80] where is it what billionaire there it is slang for the penis yeah there you go
[10598.92 → 10602.92] Charlie Brown is slang for the balls it is not if Charlie Brown was slang for anything it'd be a
[10602.92 → 10608.60] little further back than the balls yeah really but yeah I found this Reddit thread yeah
[10611.56 → 10615.64] they thought it was lioness yeah I've gotten that number of times but then
[10616.20 → 10621.08] there's people talking about you because apparently you linked this thread I did
[10623.40 → 10628.04] oh per Linus Sebastian Linus media group from three years ago, and then it's kind of weird that Linus
[10628.04 → 10632.84] linked to this thread and then apparently some tweet dude it's definitely a thing
[10636.52 → 10642.52] ocean's 11. I feel like it's a thing, but it's a thing for like four people no it's its in a movie
[10644.36 → 10651.88] I haven't seen anyone refer to the oceans 11 things it's a thing ah hold on
[10651.88 → 10661.40] oh man if is it turns out that you're wrong will you be disappointed if it turns out I'm wrong no

[10683.48 → 10691.16] in one of them they definitely say that it's definitely a thing we need we
[10691.16 → 10697.00] need the flow plane chat to research this and come back to us next week arrested development was it
[10697.00 → 10703.96] arrested development that Reddit thread that apparently you linked to was an arrested development
[10703.96 → 10712.92] Reddit thread buster referred to his dong that way it's definitely a thing I trust me it's a thing
[10717.00 → 10723.48] um I searched for Linus penis and now I am on the LTT only fans
[10723.48 → 10732.04] I thought we closed that down yeah we did but I think you can still maybe find an archive of it
[10732.04 → 10735.16] anyway speaking of things on Reddit
