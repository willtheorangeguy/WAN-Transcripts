[0.88 --> 7.10]  What is up guys? Welcome to the WAN show! I was hacked again! This time by Veritasium!
[7.30 --> 11.52]  And as many of you observed, my wife doesn't respect me.
[12.08 --> 12.20]  Oh?
[12.42 --> 15.26]  Have you read the comments on that video? It's wild. We'll talk about that later.
[15.40 --> 15.56]  What?
[15.62 --> 24.00]  Anyway, in other news this week, one of our friends in the industry has been embroiled in a little bit of controversy.
[24.90 --> 28.38]  I'll have to give you some background on that.
[28.38 --> 28.82]  What?
[28.82 --> 29.22]  Oh!
[33.16 --> 36.16]  We'll use our panel of judges to review. I just got signed out of the docs.
[36.74 --> 37.10]  Nice.
[39.92 --> 40.94]  I'm working on it.
[41.08 --> 45.66]  Wow, that's a good show! What a great show by a professional...
[45.66 --> 50.44]  Cloudflare wants to help block AI training bots, which is actually sick.
[50.44 --> 60.86]  And California is changing how companies have to communicate purchases versus basically renting software or renting a game.
[60.92 --> 62.14]  Which is pretty much what we do today.
[62.40 --> 64.94]  Which is... I'm very happy they're doing this. This is actually super cool.
[64.94 --> 93.92]  The show is brought to you today by Remotely, Squarespace, JumpCloud, and of course, our chair partner, Secret Lab, and laptop partner, LG.
[93.92 --> 97.66]  Why don't we jump into a little bit of behind the scenes.
[98.50 --> 101.04]  That Veritasium collab...
[101.04 --> 107.80]  We actually have been working on doing more collabs because we realized that we've kind of been stuck in our little bubble up here in Vancouver
[107.80 --> 112.56]  and haven't talked to anybody or collaborated with anybody pretty much since COVID.
[112.98 --> 118.36]  And there have been a couple of small exceptions, but we used to collab with other creators a fair bit and we just...
[118.36 --> 120.48]  stopped.
[120.82 --> 124.86]  In fairness to us, we've been a little busy, especially over the last year.
[124.94 --> 132.40]  We've had some work to do getting our house in order, but we kind of talked about this a couple of months ago, I guess, and aligned on that.
[132.50 --> 135.06]  Hey, we need to kind of, you know, get out there.
[135.40 --> 136.36]  Put ourselves out there.
[136.48 --> 138.00]  Start seeing people again.
[138.06 --> 139.34]  I was pushing for this for sure.
[139.42 --> 139.98]  Yeah, 100%.
[139.98 --> 140.46]  I think it's cool.
[140.60 --> 141.00]  It's a good...
[141.00 --> 143.90]  Yeah, it's a good part about being a creator.
[143.96 --> 144.88]  Well, and it's fun.
[145.04 --> 145.18]  Yeah.
[145.32 --> 146.66]  You know, I think it's fun for everybody.
[146.84 --> 147.92]  It's fun for me.
[148.02 --> 150.82]  I like to think I'm fun to collaborate with for other creators.
[150.96 --> 153.76]  And I think it's fun for the audience as well to see these crossovers.
[154.20 --> 158.70]  Anyway, the Veritasium collab was one that completely fell into our lap.
[159.34 --> 161.28]  Derek reached out and he was basically like,
[161.28 --> 166.24]  look, I think out of kind of everyone that I could work with on this,
[166.30 --> 171.20]  you're probably one of the ones that would appreciate what we're doing the most.
[171.56 --> 171.64]  Right.
[171.72 --> 175.16]  And I was like, this sounds like the coolest thing ever.
[175.32 --> 181.34]  But something people, I think, don't necessarily realize is that in a production like this,
[181.36 --> 183.40]  there is a little bit of movie magic.
[183.70 --> 186.84]  That is not to say that the attack vector isn't real.
[187.28 --> 188.26]  It is real.
[188.26 --> 195.48]  That is not to say that if Derek wanted, he couldn't have intercepted my phone number.
[195.50 --> 196.18]  You put a skin on it.
[196.76 --> 199.46]  Oh, we could talk about my skin a little bit later.
[199.66 --> 200.02]  Oh, okay.
[200.14 --> 200.56]  Not right now.
[200.66 --> 201.00]  All right.
[201.24 --> 202.04]  Don't worry about it.
[202.08 --> 202.34]  Okay.
[202.52 --> 205.78]  The point is that he could have intercepted my number.
[206.60 --> 206.84]  Yeah.
[207.08 --> 211.24]  But if you observed any things about the video that were a little weird,
[211.24 --> 221.56]  it's because it wasn't my number because Derek and our team had serious reservations around anybody,
[221.70 --> 225.96]  whether it's him or the security researcher that he partnered with or anybody,
[226.44 --> 230.64]  you know, just willy nilly intercepting my communications.
[230.88 --> 231.66]  I was mad.
[232.24 --> 232.72]  Were you?
[232.72 --> 237.72]  I saw video came up in my notifications and I had a massive like WTF.
[238.52 --> 239.86]  Why did you not tell me?
[240.26 --> 240.60]  Oh, yeah.
[240.60 --> 241.60]  That actually makes sense.
[241.68 --> 241.80]  Yeah.
[241.82 --> 242.76]  I probably should have mentioned it.
[242.76 --> 244.94]  And then I skipped through the video to be like, what happened?
[245.08 --> 248.54]  Do I need to be doing something about like no one told me anything happened.
[248.68 --> 250.94]  And then I see your phone at one point.
[250.98 --> 252.02]  And I was like, oh, it's not his phone.
[252.64 --> 252.88]  Okay.
[252.88 --> 255.62]  And then I went all the way back and just watched it casually.
[255.74 --> 257.86]  However, however, did you enjoy it?
[258.06 --> 258.48]  Yeah, it was good.
[258.62 --> 258.80]  Yeah.
[259.06 --> 269.18]  So, so one of the things that people seemed kind of upset about in the video was that Yvonne doesn't respect me.
[269.66 --> 269.80]  Why?
[269.94 --> 271.86]  Yeah, I don't, I don't understand.
[272.00 --> 276.28]  And I would just like to give you guys a little bit of background for what happened in our interaction.
[276.28 --> 288.04]  First of all, when I called her, so I knew it was coming from a real SIM, a SIM that they obtained over the counter, because the point was not to just do a theoretical demonstration.
[288.40 --> 293.40]  The point was to do a practical, real life demonstration of how this kind of an attack works.
[293.70 --> 294.94]  It is very real.
[295.44 --> 298.88]  So they just obtained a SIM and put it into a phone.
[299.20 --> 301.14]  But that wasn't my SIM.
[301.14 --> 307.36]  So when I called Yvonne, it was coming from a completely different phone number, one that she wasn't familiar with.
[307.54 --> 309.46]  Oh, I didn't even, because I knew that.
[309.58 --> 310.68]  So I didn't even register.
[311.96 --> 312.28]  Okay.
[312.62 --> 318.30]  So, so I, so when I first called her, I was just messing with her at the beginning of the call.
[318.44 --> 322.90]  Did you notice I tried to make my voice sound like, like kind of like a scam?
[322.90 --> 325.46]  I thought this was pretty obvious, to be honest.
[325.46 --> 332.88]  I, like, I didn't, I didn't even sort of, I've been sitting here confused about what they would have even been talking about.
[333.06 --> 335.16]  Because I thought it was like pretty apparent.
[335.48 --> 342.96]  So, um, so Yvonne hung up on me, not because she doesn't respect her husband or doesn't want to talk to me.
[343.14 --> 347.00]  She hung up on me because she is a smart lady.
[347.14 --> 347.56]  No, it's good.
[347.56 --> 354.52]  Who happens to be the financial controller for a small to medium sized business, depending on how you measure it.
[354.86 --> 359.96]  And is not interested in talking to AI robocaller spam people.
[360.30 --> 360.40]  Yeah.
[360.70 --> 362.50]  Um, she did a great job.
[362.70 --> 367.48]  It was actually partially just because I had an opportunity to just do a little test.
[367.52 --> 371.32]  Like if I sounded a little weird, would she stay on the line or would she hang up?
[371.38 --> 371.92]  No, that's good.
[371.96 --> 372.48]  She did the right thing.
[372.54 --> 374.04]  She did a hundred percent the right thing.
[374.04 --> 376.52]  If anything, I, yeah, I just, I thought that I didn't.
[377.56 --> 387.76]  So, so then I, the one that I do want to explain is that when I was actually talking to her and I was kind of explaining how the thing works and she said, I'm with Cindy.
[387.76 --> 389.68]  And I was immediately like, okay, bye.
[389.82 --> 391.16]  And she was like, bye.
[391.62 --> 394.16]  Um, the reason for that is because our cat was sick.
[394.82 --> 398.22]  Um, so we got two kittens a few weeks ago.
[398.28 --> 399.94]  Oh man, I guess it's almost a month ago now.
[400.00 --> 405.40]  We adopted two little kittens that were, uh, our neighbor's friend found them in their shed essentially.
[405.40 --> 407.92]  So these are just like wild cat kittens.
[408.46 --> 413.60]  Um, and one of them developed a fever and was super lethargic.
[413.60 --> 418.34]  And we contacted our vet friend and we were like, Hey, Cindy context.
[418.90 --> 421.84]  Um, how long should we wait?
[421.86 --> 429.58]  Like, cause I know from talking to you, like the smaller, the animal potentially the, the scarier, any kind of illness can be always, but for the most part.
[429.58 --> 429.76]  Yeah.
[430.08 --> 444.24]  But you know, if, if, if you don't like have a lot of blood and meat and liquid in you, you know, not drinking for a day is a lot bigger of a deal for something, you know, like this with no blood in it versus like if an elephant didn't drink for a day, it's probably going to be okay.
[444.56 --> 450.28]  It does vary a fair amount, but, but yeah, it, I think, I think we can say it's a general, in general, probably.
[450.28 --> 456.60]  So, so it was enough for me to ask and I'm like, yo, Cindy, like how long should we wait to, to, to bring him in?
[456.74 --> 459.70]  And she goes, a day at most.
[459.74 --> 460.92]  I'm like, okay.
[461.94 --> 464.80]  So what's your availability like?
[464.96 --> 466.90]  Um, so she squeezed us in.
[467.26 --> 472.66]  So the reason that I'm with Cindy meant this conversation needs to end right now.
[472.84 --> 473.46]  Oh yeah.
[473.52 --> 474.64]  Cause you're on a crazy time crunch.
[474.64 --> 480.08]  Was because she was at the vet who had graciously squeezed us in to take care of our sick kitten.
[480.88 --> 482.12]  If that was rude, I'm rude.
[482.36 --> 484.62]  I was filming a video not that long ago.
[484.84 --> 487.74]  Emma called me and I answered and was like, I'm a filling a video.
[487.78 --> 488.54]  And she was like, okay, bye.
[488.60 --> 489.58]  And just immediately hung up.
[489.80 --> 490.28]  She did.
[490.62 --> 490.86]  Yeah.
[491.22 --> 492.28]  So I don't know.
[492.42 --> 494.40]  Um, it's, it's all fine.
[494.50 --> 501.92]  So anyway, I just wanted to let you guys know there's a bit of, there's a bit of movie magic in stuff like this, but the video was great.
[501.92 --> 504.80]  And the attack is extremely real.
[505.12 --> 507.42]  And the demo was a hundred percent real.
[507.72 --> 512.26]  But if there was any kind of weirdness that you guys observed, it was because it was a little weird.
[512.36 --> 514.88]  I was calling from an unfamiliar number in the first place.
[515.02 --> 516.96]  I decided to do the voice cause I thought it was funny.
[517.48 --> 520.26]  Um, I'm actually kind of surprised he left that in the cut.
[520.32 --> 526.70]  I didn't really like, I didn't really contribute any of my thoughts to how he should cut it together or how his team should deal with that.
[526.96 --> 528.34]  They were super professional.
[528.82 --> 530.76]  Uh, it was super cool working with them.
[530.76 --> 532.20]  Um, I first met Derek.
[533.64 --> 534.82]  Quite a few years ago at this point.
[534.88 --> 536.64]  Five years ago or something like that.
[536.94 --> 537.80]  And, um.
[538.08 --> 539.02]  Remember the COVID gap.
[539.60 --> 539.96]  Yeah.
[539.98 --> 540.44]  Might be longer than that.
[540.44 --> 542.52]  No, no, it was pre-COVID gap at a creator summit, I think.
[543.20 --> 544.08]  So, yeah.
[544.46 --> 546.44]  So I first met him ages ago.
[546.46 --> 548.96]  No, I'm thinking like it might be closer to like seven is what I'm saying.
[549.00 --> 549.64]  No, I don't think so.
[549.76 --> 550.14]  I don't think so.
[550.14 --> 550.32]  20.
[551.46 --> 554.88]  Dude, seven years ago, I wasn't cool enough to get invited to a creator summit.
[555.00 --> 555.58]  That's 2017.
[556.32 --> 556.64]  I know.
[557.56 --> 558.54]  Yeah, no, I didn't go to creator.
[558.60 --> 558.72]  No.
[558.92 --> 559.16]  Really?
[559.26 --> 559.40]  Yeah.
[559.48 --> 559.76]  Yeah, no.
[559.76 --> 564.24]  Dude, even when I, even when I went, I think it was five years ago.
[564.36 --> 566.58]  I was like, not a cool kid.
[567.28 --> 567.58]  You know?
[568.10 --> 574.82]  Like, dude, there's seriously like, like massive personalities at these things with, you know,
[574.92 --> 578.54]  global, you know, followings and huge brands.
[578.54 --> 583.66]  And like, like, dude, I think that was around the time that like Dude Perfect was signing
[583.66 --> 585.24]  like deals with Nickelodeon.
[585.84 --> 586.22]  You know?
[586.72 --> 590.52]  And I'm like, hi, I make, I make tech tips.
[591.48 --> 592.64]  I can fix your computer.
[593.16 --> 595.04]  Do you want some tech tips?
[595.60 --> 596.52]  Do you like computers?
[598.08 --> 599.46]  Stop all the downloading.
[599.46 --> 600.46]  Give me to it.
[600.46 --> 600.48]  Give me to it.
[602.48 --> 602.88]  So.
[604.06 --> 604.70]  Got him.
[605.24 --> 612.96]  So I, um, so I was just happy that, you know, cool kids like Veritasium and Michael from Vsauce
[612.96 --> 615.30]  were even willing to like talk to me a little bit.
[615.84 --> 617.14]  That was, that was exciting.
[617.24 --> 618.60]  I never thought we'd collaborate.
[618.92 --> 621.56]  And then this one just happened completely out of nowhere.
[621.56 --> 622.92]  And I, I'm, I'm so excited.
[622.98 --> 624.12]  I think, I think Derek's great.
[624.52 --> 625.74]  Um, the video was great.
[625.84 --> 626.70]  Really appreciate it.
[626.88 --> 631.86]  I learned a bunch of stuff, but that's why it was a little weird and everything is okay.
[632.42 --> 633.18]  We're okay.
[633.44 --> 634.18]  Everyone's okay.
[634.62 --> 636.40]  Uh, what else do we want to talk about this week?
[636.42 --> 637.32]  You want to pick our next topic?
[637.96 --> 638.48]  Sure.
[638.94 --> 640.96]  Uh, do you want to talk about Cloudflare?
[641.74 --> 645.82]  Cloudflare has introduced and announced to not introduce announced a suite of tools called
[645.82 --> 651.02]  AI audit, which allows website owners to monitor which bots are crawling their site, as well
[651.02 --> 655.50]  as giving them background on the bots who owns them and what their purpose is.
[655.60 --> 660.94]  For example, scraping information for AI training, cataloging web pages, which, you know, you
[660.94 --> 663.76]  probably want them to do or collecting information for research.
[663.90 --> 669.72]  Users can also choose to block all bots to block them based on purpose or to block them
[669.72 --> 670.30]  individually.
[670.72 --> 675.22]  According to Cloudflare, users will eventually be able to sell access to their site to these
[675.22 --> 679.02]  bots, either with a flat rate or a scaled rate based on their purpose.
[680.40 --> 682.56]  Let's go Cloudflare.
[683.28 --> 689.62]  Yeah, it was actually kind of a good week for, like, tech giants doing pretty cool stuff.
[689.94 --> 692.12]  Doing big, like, enterprise-level stuff as well.
[692.22 --> 699.76]  Well, I don't know if it's in the dock, but Valve removed force arbitration from their end
[699.76 --> 700.38]  user agreement.
[700.86 --> 701.76]  Is it not in the dock?
[701.76 --> 703.38]  No, that's okay.
[703.54 --> 705.62]  I mean, it's a huge thing.
[705.74 --> 706.50]  The internet's very happy.
[706.62 --> 709.32]  There's a huge thing, but there's not a lot for us to say about it.
[709.32 --> 709.68]  There really isn't.
[709.72 --> 710.92]  Other than that, that happened.
[711.46 --> 713.02]  And that's super cool.
[713.26 --> 715.90]  It's like one of the only times ever that terms and conditions have changed.
[716.04 --> 717.28]  And it's like, oh, wow, that's good.
[717.34 --> 718.18]  For the better.
[718.34 --> 718.52]  Yeah.
[719.58 --> 721.14]  That is freaking awesome.
[721.68 --> 724.06]  There was another big one this week.
[724.14 --> 727.58]  Actually, why don't we jump right into one of our other kind of...
[727.58 --> 728.58]  Oh, this is sick.
[728.58 --> 729.76]  More exciting topics.
[730.02 --> 730.92]  I am not...
[730.92 --> 731.26]  It's a positive show.
[731.26 --> 738.16]  I am not necessarily the biggest fan of regulation for the sake of regulation.
[738.38 --> 745.18]  And I actually had a really interesting conversation at Creator Summit with a small creator who uses
[745.18 --> 748.74]  YouTube shorts to promote their snack business.
[748.74 --> 758.92]  Like, they are only really on YouTube because they made promotional videos for their, like, restaurant that they franchise out.
[759.28 --> 760.52]  And they did really well.
[761.14 --> 762.66]  And they're, like, at Creator Summit.
[762.74 --> 767.30]  I'm like, okay, well, this will be a cool conversation because that's not an origin story I've heard before.
[767.30 --> 767.70]  Anyway.
[772.02 --> 772.42]  Anyway.
[773.50 --> 774.88]  Anyway, so it was really cool.
[774.94 --> 782.94]  But one of the things that he mentioned to me was that working in the Lone Star State, you know, opening up in Texas was, like, easy as pie.
[782.94 --> 793.64]  And the regulatory burden for, like, a small, like, snack franchise somewhere like California, he said, was much higher and that it was very frustrating.
[793.96 --> 800.36]  But you got to give California props once in a while because this is awesome.
[800.36 --> 813.40]  California has passed AB 2426, a new law that forces digital storefronts to clearly state that they are only offering a digital license at the point of sale.
[813.70 --> 820.22]  These companies must list all restrictions on the license up front, including the fact that it can be revoked.
[820.22 --> 831.14]  Digital storefronts cannot imply that customers are buying a product that they will own unless the end user can permanently download the product and use it offline indefinitely.
[831.76 --> 832.12]  So good.
[832.34 --> 836.44]  Companies that fail to do this will be subject to a fine for false advertising.
[836.68 --> 837.54]  Because that's what it is.
[837.56 --> 838.80]  And so they should be.
[838.92 --> 840.42]  You do not buy games.
[840.50 --> 841.68]  You don't own games.
[842.06 --> 842.84]  You lease them.
[842.96 --> 845.82]  In fact, you don't even lease them because there isn't a clear term.
[845.92 --> 847.66]  There isn't a clear term to the agreement.
[848.44 --> 848.92]  You are.
[849.66 --> 850.64]  Well, what even is it?
[850.72 --> 851.04]  It's not.
[851.16 --> 852.48]  It's like month to month rental.
[852.66 --> 855.24]  Buying a temporary right or something.
[855.52 --> 856.14]  Right of access.
[856.32 --> 856.74]  I mean, it's.
[856.90 --> 857.26]  OK.
[857.46 --> 858.22]  Yes, yes, yes.
[858.22 --> 859.18]  It's an access license.
[859.26 --> 860.30]  I understand what it is.
[860.34 --> 865.20]  I just mean the way that they phrased it in the past makes it sound like you are buying games.
[865.20 --> 866.98]  You go on the valve.
[867.16 --> 867.38]  What?
[868.06 --> 868.86]  Which tab is it?
[868.90 --> 869.54]  What's it labeled?
[869.76 --> 870.08]  Store.
[870.26 --> 870.52]  Right.
[871.20 --> 872.02]  You go on the store.
[872.80 --> 874.46]  That sounds like I'm buying a game.
[874.52 --> 875.00]  Does it not?
[875.24 --> 876.38]  People are like, you forgot.
[876.52 --> 876.98]  G.O.G.
[876.98 --> 878.66]  No, we didn't.
[878.80 --> 880.84]  I don't know what you're even talking about.
[880.94 --> 881.70]  We're not even talking about G.O.G.
[881.94 --> 882.70]  Get off it.
[882.96 --> 883.60]  G.O.G.'s great.
[883.88 --> 884.04]  Yeah.
[884.16 --> 884.52]  Love G.O.G.
[884.62 --> 885.02]  Yes, yes.
[885.04 --> 888.76]  When you buy a game from G.O.G. that is a DRM free game that you download, you are buying
[888.76 --> 889.08]  the game.
[889.18 --> 890.90]  They're just not going to have to change anything.
[890.92 --> 892.36]  Yeah, we're not talking about G.O.G.
[892.40 --> 893.64]  Other people will have to change things.
[893.64 --> 895.18]  We're talking about literally everything else.
[895.36 --> 895.74]  Stop.
[895.94 --> 898.88]  I don't hate hot dogs!
[901.06 --> 901.80]  My goodness.
[901.80 --> 909.52]  The sponsor of the bill, Assemblymember Erwin, cited Ubisoft deleting the crew from players'
[909.66 --> 912.94]  accounts in April as an example of why the law was necessary.
[913.98 --> 915.48]  Absolute Chad.
[915.74 --> 916.24]  Nice move.
[916.40 --> 917.44]  Absolute Chad.
[917.44 --> 917.96]  Good moves.
[918.18 --> 918.56]  S plus.
[918.68 --> 923.36]  Thank you for paying attention to stuff that sucks and going, well, hold on a second.
[923.68 --> 927.42]  Is this a one-off or is this a systemic problem?
[927.96 --> 929.74]  This is a systemic problem.
[930.94 --> 935.76]  California also passed another law, the Phone-Free School Act, which requires schools to limit
[935.76 --> 940.14]  student access to cell phones except in case of emergency or with the permission of a teacher,
[940.30 --> 944.20]  administrator, doctor, or individualized education program for children with special needs.
[944.20 --> 947.80]  This makes California the 15th state to have passed such a law.
[948.14 --> 953.72]  I have got to say, there's recently been a lot of movement on cell phone bans in schools
[953.72 --> 954.78]  here in Canada as well.
[956.48 --> 958.94]  I'm kind of cool with it.
[959.02 --> 959.28]  Oh, yeah.
[959.48 --> 965.10]  I'm pretty glad that my kids, by the time they hit high school, are not just all going
[965.10 --> 966.90]  to be on their cell phones all day.
[967.00 --> 968.56]  I genuinely think it's a huge deal.
[968.90 --> 972.22]  Like, I don't have kids, but if I did, I would...
[972.22 --> 972.88]  That you know of.
[972.88 --> 973.76]  Oh, my goodness.
[974.16 --> 974.82]  If I did, I would...
[974.82 --> 977.18]  I mean, the 100 success rates got to count for something.
[977.20 --> 982.46]  Very much hope that this would exist because the brain rot is so intense.
[984.46 --> 989.62]  Billions of dollars going into trying to corrupt your mind into never leaving a device is not
[989.62 --> 992.22]  something that you want flowing into the brain of a child.
[992.64 --> 993.82]  Like, it's just...
[993.82 --> 994.26]  I don't know.
[994.26 --> 1001.08]  And, like, I realize that we both literally sound, but think of the children right now.
[1001.96 --> 1003.24]  But actually...
[1003.24 --> 1012.56]  But these are things that, at this point, it's becoming fairly well documented, have negative
[1012.56 --> 1014.44]  effects on still developing minds.
[1014.68 --> 1016.06]  It's a think of the everyone.
[1016.40 --> 1018.76]  Like, this screws over adults and stuff too, right?
[1018.76 --> 1021.04]  But, like, at a certain point, you can't control them.
[1021.08 --> 1022.24]  And they're not even really controlling.
[1022.28 --> 1023.48]  They're just controlling them at school.
[1024.24 --> 1026.48]  Which, like, that makes sense anyways.
[1026.72 --> 1026.90]  Yeah.
[1026.98 --> 1030.26]  What are you doing on your phone at school that you need your phone for?
[1031.08 --> 1031.80]  Theoretically, nothing.
[1032.00 --> 1032.42]  It's school.
[1032.58 --> 1035.02]  Don't a lot of the classrooms have laptops and stuff now?
[1035.14 --> 1035.80]  Yeah, depending.
[1036.04 --> 1036.70]  Depending, probably.
[1036.70 --> 1036.84]  Yeah.
[1036.94 --> 1038.36]  And if you need one, it does.
[1038.44 --> 1038.66]  Yes.
[1038.70 --> 1038.86]  Yeah.
[1039.34 --> 1040.86]  And if you don't need one, then...
[1040.86 --> 1041.70]  Then it's not going to.
[1041.78 --> 1042.58]  Then it doesn't need it.
[1042.64 --> 1042.86]  Yeah.
[1043.04 --> 1044.18]  So, you don't need your phone.
[1044.86 --> 1045.20]  Stop.
[1045.48 --> 1048.00]  It's like, I'm honestly surprised that they...
[1048.00 --> 1050.98]  I'm honestly surprised that this took as long as it did.
[1051.06 --> 1056.56]  I mean, they would literally stop us from intercepting pieces of paper that we passed to each other.
[1058.80 --> 1059.20]  So...
[1059.20 --> 1059.80]  How...
[1059.80 --> 1060.64]  How...
[1060.64 --> 1061.24]  How...
[1061.24 --> 1063.78]  I mean, I guess it can get kind of complicated, right?
[1064.04 --> 1066.28]  You know, oh, this is my personal property.
[1066.40 --> 1067.54]  You can't confiscate it from...
[1067.54 --> 1070.40]  But, like, that never stopped anyone from confiscating something from me.
[1070.52 --> 1073.24]  I mean, they confiscated my silly string when I sprayed that girl with it.
[1073.28 --> 1074.60]  I think the rules changed.
[1074.74 --> 1074.96]  Yeah.
[1075.14 --> 1077.72]  That was only because she was the daughter of a teacher, though.
[1077.90 --> 1078.42]  When I was in...
[1078.42 --> 1079.52]  They wouldn't have done it for anyone else.
[1079.54 --> 1082.68]  I got an in-school suspension for silly string.
[1083.22 --> 1084.22]  Who cares?
[1084.96 --> 1095.56]  When I was in grade one, I was racing little boats down the stream that was at my school with my friends on lunch or recess or whatever.
[1095.56 --> 1097.84]  And then I had my boat with me in class.
[1097.96 --> 1099.30]  And I wasn't even playing with it.
[1099.34 --> 1100.14]  I just had it with me.
[1100.18 --> 1100.88]  And she took it.
[1101.06 --> 1102.06]  And she never gave it back.
[1102.32 --> 1102.68]  Ever.
[1102.76 --> 1103.56]  That witch.
[1103.74 --> 1103.98]  Ever.
[1104.14 --> 1105.00]  How dare she.
[1105.38 --> 1107.42]  I will literally never get over this.
[1107.68 --> 1109.32]  This will bother me forever.
[1109.54 --> 1112.48]  The fact that she never gave it back is nuts.
[1112.56 --> 1113.50]  His paper boat.
[1113.90 --> 1115.58]  My silly string in suspension.
[1116.92 --> 1117.74]  Scarred for life.
[1117.88 --> 1118.44]  School's...
[1118.44 --> 1119.78]  School's traumatic, man.
[1120.48 --> 1121.46]  It's traumatic.
[1121.46 --> 1126.64]  I mean, my dad was always telling me about the Catholic school and they hit his knuckles with the ruler and everything.
[1126.76 --> 1129.32]  I'm like, Dad, you had it easy, brother.
[1129.42 --> 1130.00]  What about my silly string?
[1130.00 --> 1130.54]  You had it easy.
[1130.88 --> 1133.42]  What about my silly string?
[1135.52 --> 1136.30]  Oh, man.
[1136.74 --> 1138.50]  But no, seriously, I think it's good.
[1140.08 --> 1144.42]  There's the arguments of like, oh, yeah, but you would have it on you as a tool.
[1145.32 --> 1146.70]  So like learning how to use it.
[1146.88 --> 1147.28]  Yeah.
[1148.58 --> 1149.44]  It's not the point.
[1149.58 --> 1150.98]  You aren't doing that with it.
[1151.20 --> 1152.86]  You don't just immediately stop learning when you leave school either.
[1153.22 --> 1154.52]  And like you'll get into the...
[1154.52 --> 1159.48]  You will have no problem learning the habit that your phone has answers to things outside of school.
[1159.60 --> 1161.60]  Yeah, I'm really not worried about that.
[1161.66 --> 1164.88]  I don't think that kids need to be trained to use their phone more.
[1165.46 --> 1165.66]  Yeah.
[1165.76 --> 1167.64]  Let's be real here.
[1167.64 --> 1168.32]  Not an issue.
[1168.46 --> 1169.00]  Bad argument.
[1169.58 --> 1172.84]  One thing I want to add is there was a bunch of Cloudflare announcements, actually.
[1172.94 --> 1174.34]  And some of the other ones are really cool.
[1174.58 --> 1180.68]  One of the ones that I want to point out was tweeted out by Troy Hunt and shared to me by, I think it was Handyman.
[1181.80 --> 1182.78]  Any relation to Mike?
[1184.86 --> 1185.98]  You know Troy, right?
[1186.06 --> 1186.38]  I know.
[1186.50 --> 1186.70]  I know.
[1187.92 --> 1189.42]  I'm just being an a**hole.
[1191.82 --> 1199.10]  Wrap Cloudflare around your site and they can now automatically hit have I been pwned passwords during a login attempt.
[1199.42 --> 1202.80]  Check it against our DB, as in have I been pwned DB.
[1202.80 --> 1206.24]  And pass a request header to the origin if the password has been breached.
[1206.24 --> 1207.34]  That's so cool!
[1207.72 --> 1209.74]  Actually super awesome.
[1211.46 --> 1212.42]  Really awesome.
[1212.42 --> 1217.80]  If Cloudflare could figure out their enterprise support, I would be very happy.
[1217.80 --> 1221.72]  But your tools are great and have always been really awesome.
[1221.86 --> 1223.50]  I like working with you very much.
[1223.62 --> 1227.90]  No plans of ever cancelling subscriptions, so I'm putting myself in a bad negotiation position.
[1228.16 --> 1232.46]  But your enterprise support has always been a little bit questionable and it's really expensive.
[1232.46 --> 1234.36]  So if you could figure that out, that would be great.
[1234.64 --> 1235.20]  Thank you.
[1236.20 --> 1236.86]  Thank you very much.
[1236.92 --> 1237.14]  Sick.
[1238.30 --> 1242.82]  We should probably update the sign.
[1243.14 --> 1244.16]  What are we supposed to do next?
[1245.20 --> 1247.08]  If you want next, let's do a couple of merch messages.
[1247.42 --> 1247.84]  Heck yeah.
[1248.84 --> 1252.44]  I mean, how many topics do we have to get through?
[1252.52 --> 1254.28]  I mean, we can backload them.
[1254.32 --> 1254.66]  That's fine.
[1254.76 --> 1255.96]  I think we're gonna...
[1255.96 --> 1257.58]  We already did three topics, Dan.
[1258.14 --> 1258.70]  I don't know.
[1258.70 --> 1259.42]  I don't know what's going on.
[1259.42 --> 1263.02]  I was doing math the whole time trying to figure out when I'm supposed to end this show, so...
[1263.02 --> 1263.76]  Whatever.
[1264.72 --> 1266.98]  We don't expect him to actually listen to us.
[1267.02 --> 1267.82]  He just says...
[1267.82 --> 1270.14]  We only pay him enough to sit in the same room.
[1270.48 --> 1271.30]  All right, left mic.
[1271.38 --> 1271.88]  Let's keep going.
[1271.96 --> 1272.80]  To take out the...
[1272.80 --> 1276.08]  Come on.
[1276.60 --> 1277.52]  We got deadlines.
[1277.76 --> 1278.84]  We got dying birds.
[1279.02 --> 1279.44]  All right.
[1281.82 --> 1282.86]  Oh, dude.
[1284.06 --> 1284.42]  Dude.
[1285.56 --> 1286.86]  What the heck?
[1286.86 --> 1289.38]  You better hope they're alive when he gets home.
[1289.42 --> 1290.48]  Well, that's why I want to get them home.
[1290.82 --> 1291.56]  Otherwise, they will.
[1291.56 --> 1291.86]  They will be.
[1291.92 --> 1292.38]  They'll be fine.
[1292.44 --> 1292.96]  They're fine.
[1293.04 --> 1293.44]  They're fine.
[1293.54 --> 1294.62]  Guess what's here?
[1295.74 --> 1296.96]  Cargo pants!
[1297.22 --> 1303.08]  I would like to take a moment to just point out that these pants do not defy the laws of physics.
[1303.66 --> 1306.72]  So, you cannot fit a submarine in them.
[1306.86 --> 1307.12]  Oh.
[1307.56 --> 1308.04]  What?
[1308.60 --> 1309.28]  Well, just...
[1309.28 --> 1311.58]  There were some people upset about the size of the laptop bag.
[1311.68 --> 1315.00]  Somebody's gonna upload a picture with, like, a Lego submarine in their pocket or something.
[1315.00 --> 1315.70]  I'm sure they will.
[1315.82 --> 1316.84]  Linus lied again.
[1317.12 --> 1318.14]  He was wrong.
[1318.14 --> 1319.40]  Linus was wrong.
[1319.64 --> 1320.08]  Anyway.
[1320.36 --> 1320.84]  Get him, boys.
[1321.00 --> 1325.14]  The LTT cargo pants are now here for your wearing and...
[1325.14 --> 1325.52]  Is that you?
[1325.74 --> 1326.28]  Is that one you?
[1326.66 --> 1327.12]  Which one?
[1327.28 --> 1327.66]  This one?
[1328.20 --> 1328.40]  Yeah.
[1328.54 --> 1329.16]  Yeah, of course.
[1329.46 --> 1329.72]  Yeah.
[1329.72 --> 1332.90]  For your wearing and viewing pleasure.
[1332.90 --> 1341.46]  Complete with magnetic pocket flaps, hammer loops, zipper back pockets, YKKBB.
[1342.60 --> 1347.54]  Loads of carrying capacity with different sizes of either pass-through.
[1347.96 --> 1350.94]  So, see, these ones here are, like, pass-throughs for pens or whatever else.
[1351.22 --> 1352.64]  Or regular pockets.
[1353.52 --> 1354.08]  Yeah.
[1354.24 --> 1355.24]  We flippin' love these.
[1355.24 --> 1357.50]  We have spent a lot of time developing them.
[1357.50 --> 1362.46]  There's, like, an army of internal people that absolutely swear by them.
[1362.56 --> 1364.42]  Tynan, I don't think, ever takes them off.
[1364.62 --> 1365.30]  Yeah, he's always on.
[1365.34 --> 1369.30]  Andrew from the camera crew only rarely removes his.
[1369.60 --> 1371.00]  I have been dailying these.
[1371.08 --> 1373.84]  You've probably seen them a lot in the videos, in case you're wondering.
[1374.68 --> 1376.00]  This is how they patina.
[1378.52 --> 1381.56]  So, they definitely change in color a little bit.
[1381.98 --> 1382.64]  But, yeah.
[1383.00 --> 1385.38]  I actually really like the way they fade out.
[1385.50 --> 1387.86]  Yeah, I was gonna say, if anything, I think they might look better.
[1389.78 --> 1392.14]  Anyway, it's available now.
[1392.24 --> 1393.30]  21 pockets.
[1395.12 --> 1397.28]  Gusseted crotch that allows for a wide range of motion.
[1397.48 --> 1400.60]  Darted dual-layer knee pads that allow you to kneel in them comfortably.
[1400.60 --> 1406.52]  They're great for everyday wear with a soft, washed-down feel and available now at lmg.gg slash cargo pants.
[1406.70 --> 1412.40]  Now, there is a slight controversy already because I'm addicted to it.
[1413.94 --> 1419.74]  We only offer different waist sizes and a 30-inch inseam at this time.
[1419.88 --> 1425.80]  We are exploring alternate inseam lengths, which is gonna be good for taller boys.
[1426.68 --> 1428.34]  Yes, yes, Dan, I hear you.
[1428.34 --> 1431.14]  But we need to see if we've...
[1431.14 --> 1431.94]  Let me put it this way.
[1433.56 --> 1435.34]  We've never really had...
[1435.34 --> 1438.30]  Oh, Luke, you are standing in none of our camera views.
[1438.44 --> 1440.14]  Yeah, but you can't see my feet anyways.
[1440.18 --> 1440.64]  What a guy.
[1441.30 --> 1443.78]  There's no camera view that shows that.
[1443.98 --> 1444.64]  Yeah, they can.
[1445.62 --> 1447.34]  None of our cargo...
[1447.34 --> 1448.46]  Other website.
[1448.88 --> 1449.62]  Oh, my goodness.
[1450.60 --> 1456.84]  None of our lower half products have ever been particularly out-of-the-park grand slam hits.
[1456.84 --> 1462.64]  This one actually does look like it's going pretty well so far, but we didn't want to overcommit.
[1463.68 --> 1466.64]  Every additional inseam length adds another...
[1467.18 --> 1469.50]  Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...
[1469.50 --> 1470.76]  Nine skews.
[1471.96 --> 1474.88]  So, we would like to restock.
[1475.04 --> 1478.70]  We have actually already done the work for 32-inch and 34-inch inseams.
[1478.98 --> 1481.64]  Inseam is crotch to ankle, right?
[1481.74 --> 1482.06]  Is that right?
[1482.10 --> 1483.32]  If I recall correctly, yes.
[1483.32 --> 1485.12]  I don't know.
[1485.40 --> 1486.32]  So, anyway...
[1487.54 --> 1488.48]  Yep, we know.
[1488.72 --> 1489.78]  And we're working on it.
[1489.94 --> 1494.62]  And if these ones sell well, then we will absolutely be looking to do more.
[1494.82 --> 1495.06]  Yes.
[1495.90 --> 1502.60]  The other thing that is finally here is the new spout lids for LTT water bottles are now available.
[1502.96 --> 1504.84]  We cleared out all of the old ones.
[1505.88 --> 1506.72]  Da-da-da-da-da.
[1506.72 --> 1507.32]  Hey, hey!
[1507.48 --> 1512.64]  New and improved spout lid V2 on every LTT insulated water bottle.
[1513.12 --> 1514.12]  Easier to hold.
[1514.44 --> 1515.52]  Easier to clean.
[1515.94 --> 1516.98]  More durable.
[1517.20 --> 1518.26]  Those are the main benefits.
[1518.46 --> 1521.38]  And I have a spout lid for myself to upgrade to right now.
[1521.44 --> 1522.00]  Oh, look at that.
[1522.04 --> 1523.38]  We've got a bunch of different colors.
[1523.88 --> 1525.08]  How wonderful is that?
[1525.38 --> 1525.98]  Gotta love it.
[1526.86 --> 1529.68]  I think the water bottles have been out for a while, so now you can get them again.
[1530.22 --> 1530.62]  Yeah.
[1530.62 --> 1532.10]  The packaging is plastic.
[1532.58 --> 1535.66]  The reason is that these are from the same...
[1535.66 --> 1539.24]  It's the same packaging we used on our old spout lids that we had.
[1539.76 --> 1545.08]  And we just forgot that we still used plastic packaging the last time we ordered these,
[1545.16 --> 1545.96]  which was a long time ago.
[1546.02 --> 1546.94]  We ordered, like, a ton of them.
[1547.40 --> 1549.18]  And we never updated them on that.
[1549.24 --> 1550.98]  We wanted new packaging that didn't have plastic.
[1551.14 --> 1552.84]  So, we're sorry we've let you down.
[1553.22 --> 1554.44]  That is our bad.
[1555.06 --> 1559.40]  Anyway, I want to do a quick demo of the durability of the new lid.
[1559.40 --> 1564.10]  And this is either going to be a great moment in Wancho history...
[1564.10 --> 1567.52]  Is this an Elon Musk throws steel ball at windshield moment?
[1567.52 --> 1574.06]  Dude, we don't even need to go Elon Musk to find an example of an epic live fail when doing a product demonstration.
[1574.06 --> 1574.28]  Is this an us?
[1574.64 --> 1578.40]  Is this a backpack dual layer moment?
[1579.26 --> 1579.68]  Shank.
[1580.54 --> 1583.42]  So, here, we're going to go Linus Cam here.
[1583.68 --> 1585.30]  So, what are you going to whack it against the table?
[1585.34 --> 1587.82]  So, you're going to notice that the threads are on the outside.
[1588.08 --> 1589.32]  Yes, it feels a little funny.
[1589.40 --> 1592.12]  On the lips.
[1592.24 --> 1595.10]  But we felt that the improvement in cleanability...
[1595.66 --> 1596.50]  Incredibly easy to clean, though.
[1596.68 --> 1602.20]  ...was worth the slight issue there.
[1602.36 --> 1603.72]  We have these little pull tabs.
[1603.86 --> 1604.60]  Those are awesome.
[1604.68 --> 1605.32]  On our O-rings.
[1605.66 --> 1606.74]  In the top one, too.
[1606.98 --> 1607.18]  Yep.
[1608.12 --> 1611.12]  Also, in the top, there's a little pull tab in there.
[1611.24 --> 1612.80]  So, you can pull the O-rings out.
[1613.30 --> 1614.36]  Really clean them.
[1614.42 --> 1618.02]  Because, guys, you should pull them out and you should clean them.
[1618.12 --> 1620.42]  On your water bottle, on your thermos, on everything.
[1620.56 --> 1624.72]  It is disgusting, the amount of gunk that can get built up in these.
[1626.08 --> 1627.82]  You said it doesn't fit the old bottle, right?
[1627.86 --> 1628.78]  It does fit the old bottle.
[1628.90 --> 1629.38]  Fit the old bottle?
[1629.44 --> 1629.58]  Yeah.
[1629.58 --> 1630.60]  I don't think anyone said this.
[1630.60 --> 1631.08]  This is an old bottle?
[1631.34 --> 1631.46]  Yeah.
[1631.46 --> 1631.66]  Ah!
[1631.82 --> 1633.90]  The very, very OG bottles.
[1634.50 --> 1637.30]  The very, very first order that we ever placed.
[1637.50 --> 1639.90]  It fits them, but you've got to screw them on, like, really tighter.
[1640.00 --> 1640.26]  It leaks.
[1640.44 --> 1640.66]  Okay.
[1640.72 --> 1641.88]  They changed the threading a little bit.
[1641.92 --> 1643.44]  It won't affect pretty much anybody.
[1643.44 --> 1647.94]  Because anyone who upgraded to a new lid with those.
[1648.08 --> 1649.30]  I talked to customer service about it.
[1649.36 --> 1651.96]  They were like, yeah, basically anyone who complained about it, we replaced their bottles.
[1652.26 --> 1653.68]  And, like, it's pretty much dealt with.
[1654.46 --> 1656.38]  Anyway, the other thing.
[1656.50 --> 1657.50]  What's the other thing?
[1658.14 --> 1658.66]  Oh, yeah.
[1658.78 --> 1660.74]  So, this stays in place.
[1662.56 --> 1663.26]  Real good.
[1665.66 --> 1667.68]  But the big one is that.
[1667.98 --> 1668.86]  Yeah, what's he going to do?
[1668.86 --> 1673.02]  We have upgraded the durability of this handle here.
[1673.02 --> 1673.76]  Dripping on your laptop.
[1673.86 --> 1674.66]  Well, you know what?
[1674.76 --> 1676.88]  Maybe you should have thought of that before you gave me a laptop.
[1678.74 --> 1679.14]  Okay.
[1679.22 --> 1679.80]  So, there's.
[1680.08 --> 1683.28]  This one has, like, kind of a little, like, sharp spot.
[1683.36 --> 1683.78]  The old one.
[1684.08 --> 1686.08]  So, the new one is nicely rounded.
[1686.24 --> 1689.78]  So, when you're carrying it like this, it doesn't, like, cut into your fingers.
[1689.94 --> 1690.40]  That's what you mean.
[1690.56 --> 1691.20]  Okay.
[1692.18 --> 1694.68]  But the bigger difference is that.
[1694.98 --> 1695.68]  What is it?
[1695.72 --> 1696.20]  What's the plan?
[1697.68 --> 1698.02]  Hold on.
[1698.10 --> 1700.18]  Which way is tight?
[1700.18 --> 1703.66]  The old one breaks about that easily.
[1704.70 --> 1705.10]  Okay.
[1706.42 --> 1707.72]  That did, in fact, happen.
[1708.34 --> 1708.70]  Yep.
[1709.48 --> 1711.12]  I thought that was the new one.
[1711.38 --> 1713.32]  And I saw it instantly break when he did that.
[1713.40 --> 1714.64]  And I was like, oh, boy.
[1715.24 --> 1715.94]  Y'all ready for this?
[1716.12 --> 1716.28]  Yeah.
[1716.28 --> 1717.28]  Let me just hide the banner.
[1718.00 --> 1718.34]  Oh, yeah.
[1718.34 --> 1718.62]  For sure.
[1718.74 --> 1718.86]  Yeah.
[1719.34 --> 1719.60]  Cool.
[1719.60 --> 1729.40]  That's hitting pretty hard.
[1729.48 --> 1730.40]  That's harder than a drop.
[1731.10 --> 1731.66]  Let's go.
[1732.62 --> 1733.10]  Nice.
[1733.66 --> 1734.14]  Okay.
[1734.62 --> 1735.16]  All right.
[1735.70 --> 1736.42]  Break the table.
[1736.60 --> 1736.72]  Yeah.
[1738.72 --> 1742.10]  Oh, goodness.
[1743.44 --> 1744.14]  Still good.
[1744.42 --> 1745.00]  Luke, verify.
[1745.32 --> 1745.82]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1745.88 --> 1746.66]  Luke wouldn't lie to you.
[1746.78 --> 1746.92]  That's good.
[1747.20 --> 1747.54]  That's good.
[1747.54 --> 1750.34]  All right.
[1750.56 --> 1751.00]  Yeah, there is.
[1751.04 --> 1752.06]  I don't even think there's a mark.
[1752.52 --> 1753.50]  So, spout lid V2.
[1754.52 --> 1755.88]  There's probably a mark on the table.
[1757.00 --> 1757.50]  Is there?
[1758.00 --> 1758.30]  Yep.
[1758.68 --> 1758.94]  Yeah.
[1759.26 --> 1759.96]  Yeah, there's dents.
[1760.06 --> 1760.34]  All right.
[1760.40 --> 1761.74]  Well, water bottle one, I guess.
[1761.84 --> 1762.04]  Yep.
[1763.40 --> 1764.02]  So, yeah.
[1764.60 --> 1764.92]  Cool.
[1765.50 --> 1766.00]  There you go.
[1766.32 --> 1766.64]  Enjoy.
[1766.98 --> 1767.96]  So, right.
[1768.06 --> 1768.60]  Merch messages.
[1769.30 --> 1770.60]  Now's a great time to leave a merch message.
[1770.66 --> 1774.82]  All you got to do is go to lttstore.com, throw one of our great new water bottle V2 lid
[1774.82 --> 1779.16]  plus water bottles or just a lid in your cart and you'll see a little box pop up for
[1779.16 --> 1779.64]  merch messages.
[1779.76 --> 1781.04]  You can also check out the new cargo pants.
[1781.78 --> 1785.42]  Merch messages will go to producer Dan who will forward them to someone internally, respond
[1785.42 --> 1788.76]  to them himself, sometimes incomprehensibly.
[1789.20 --> 1793.52]  Or he can curate them for me and Luke to respond to.
[1793.62 --> 1797.20]  Dan, do you want to show them how merch messages work?
[1798.02 --> 1798.48]  Yeah, sure.
[1798.94 --> 1800.98]  Hey, Linus, I just got a kitten.
[1801.16 --> 1802.14]  His name is Kirkland.
[1802.32 --> 1802.98]  Really excited.
[1803.24 --> 1807.28]  Since you have more cables than anyone, how do you keep them from chewing on cables?
[1809.12 --> 1813.16]  You hope that your cat doesn't develop the habit of chewing on cables.
[1813.52 --> 1819.24]  In all seriousness, though, you can buy stuff that you kind of paint onto it that tastes really,
[1819.24 --> 1819.94]  really bad to them.
[1820.04 --> 1822.14]  That is probably the best way to go about it.
[1822.14 --> 1829.18]  You can also try keeping the little spritzer near and giving them the old spritz when they
[1829.18 --> 1830.94]  do something that they're really, really not supposed to.
[1831.90 --> 1835.12]  But the bitter stuff is probably your best bet.
[1836.20 --> 1843.54]  To my dear Linus, Luke, and Dan the man, I was wondering if any fixed shaft screwdrivers
[1843.54 --> 1844.14]  were in development.
[1844.56 --> 1849.16]  And if so, what are the different challenges in design compared to the existing screwdrivers?
[1849.26 --> 1849.74]  Fixed craft?
[1849.96 --> 1850.56]  Fixed craft.
[1850.56 --> 1851.22]  It's hard to say.
[1851.52 --> 1852.78]  Fixed shaft screwdrivers.
[1852.78 --> 1855.88]  Fixed shaft started development before precision did.
[1856.72 --> 1863.56]  We had sort of this grand concept of what it would look like where we would have like
[1864.28 --> 1872.76]  blades and handles that were kind of stocked as pieces and we would almost build to order.
[1872.76 --> 1879.24]  So the idea was that we would have kind of like with our desk pads where it was like and
[1879.24 --> 1884.86]  our water bottles where it's one price and you kind of decide what size of one you need.
[1884.98 --> 1885.24]  Right.
[1885.32 --> 1891.44]  The idea was that we would just have a screwdriver price and then you could mix and match your
[1891.44 --> 1892.66]  blades and your handles.
[1892.66 --> 1897.58]  So if you wanted like a giant you have giant hands and you wanted like a giant handle with like a little
[1897.58 --> 1901.46]  Phillips number one or something like that or you wanted a long one or a short one,
[1901.46 --> 1906.34]  you'd essentially be able to get a screwdriver in any configuration that you wanted.
[1906.34 --> 1913.02]  And if we could get the cold press fit right, then it would have all the strength and like rigidity
[1913.02 --> 1915.66]  and solidity of a fixed shaft screwdriver.
[1915.80 --> 1923.42]  But with the flexibility of a configurable screwdriver, we did a lot of development on that.
[1923.56 --> 1928.16]  We we worked on a version of the handle that has like a rubberized over mold.
[1928.16 --> 1933.08]  Um, I don't think that ever went to actual injection molding, but we have like prototypes
[1933.08 --> 1934.80]  that feel pretty darn good.
[1935.28 --> 1938.12]  Uh, we designed a bunch of different blades.
[1938.24 --> 1943.54]  We worked out sort of, you know, exactly what they would be, but where it kind of has stalled
[1943.54 --> 1951.26]  right now is a process for assembly and the risk of stocking that many SKUs.
[1951.80 --> 1956.72]  So if you think about it, Phillips number two, let's say, you know, for computer builders,
[1956.72 --> 1958.32]  that's going to be one you're familiar with.
[1958.86 --> 1962.24]  How many Phillips number two blades do I need?
[1962.30 --> 1962.88]  Oh, well, hold on.
[1962.92 --> 1964.06]  First, how many handles do I need?
[1964.14 --> 1966.24]  We wanted about, we wanted five sizes.
[1966.58 --> 1975.00]  We wanted, um, small, um, extra, extra small, small, medium, extra medium and large or something
[1975.00 --> 1975.38]  like that.
[1975.42 --> 1978.04]  I forget, I forget exactly what we called them, but it was internal goofy names.
[1978.16 --> 1983.44]  Like they weren't, they weren't, uh, customer ready of those micro medium of those.
[1983.44 --> 1985.96]  We were going to do, I think two shaft girths.
[1985.96 --> 1991.06]  So the, the two biggest sizes were going to be like a big boy or actually it might've
[1991.06 --> 1991.62]  been three.
[1991.96 --> 1993.86]  I think it was three shaft girths.
[1994.10 --> 1999.82]  So already for each handle, we're going to need two molds or an insert mold.
[2000.30 --> 2002.86]  Um, so that, that adds a bit of complexity as well.
[2002.86 --> 2007.46]  So like the big one, you could do like a giant, like slot number three, right?
[2007.50 --> 2009.08]  Or you could do like a Phillips two.
[2009.08 --> 2014.76]  And then the very smallest one, you could do like a tiny, like triple, triple zero Phillips,
[2014.76 --> 2017.54]  or you could do up to maybe like a Phillips one, right?
[2017.56 --> 2021.38]  So you'd have these like three, uh, these three blade sizes and these five handle sizes.
[2021.38 --> 2024.42]  And there's going to be, you wouldn't be able to do like the smallest blade in the
[2024.42 --> 2027.16]  biggest handle or vice versa, but there'd be some overlap there.
[2027.16 --> 2027.96]  Okay.
[2028.14 --> 2031.22]  Then we had to figure out all the different tip styles, right?
[2031.28 --> 2038.16]  So a Phillips number two, we were going to need at least probably two blades times, however
[2038.16 --> 2039.44]  many lengths we want to support.
[2039.56 --> 2045.16]  So if you want like a stubby length, a medium length and a long, like a long boy, then, okay,
[2045.16 --> 2046.74]  that's already, what, what is that?
[2046.80 --> 2049.38]  Like six blades for Phillips number two.
[2049.54 --> 2052.40]  So, and that's just, that's just one, that's just one tip.
[2052.40 --> 2058.18]  Um, then we had to figure out a modular system for labeling the cap because we wanted to be
[2058.18 --> 2063.36]  able to like put these into like a block, kind of like knives, um, and, and be able
[2063.36 --> 2067.70]  to easily see, or just like some kind of screwdriver holder, like a vertical one or, or angled one
[2067.70 --> 2068.06]  or whatever.
[2068.34 --> 2072.66]  Uh, we wanted to be able to, to do like a modular labeling system essentially.
[2072.66 --> 2074.38]  And we, we came up with a system for that.
[2074.44 --> 2078.00]  They were just going to be like silicone, like, like kind of butt plug shaped things.
[2078.00 --> 2082.32]  And they would just pop into the butt of the screwdriver, the butt end.
[2082.40 --> 2089.78]  Like, like in the butt, um, they were like plugs and they go in the, what you're making
[2089.78 --> 2090.12]  it dirty.
[2090.18 --> 2090.92]  It's the butt of a screwdriver.
[2091.26 --> 2093.10]  You danced around, you danced around everything else.
[2093.46 --> 2095.46]  And you just went right in on that one.
[2095.80 --> 2096.14]  Oh yeah.
[2096.18 --> 2096.62]  Right in.
[2096.96 --> 2097.36]  Yeah.
[2097.46 --> 2105.68]  With the, with the, just, um, did I, did I already say the, right.
[2105.68 --> 2106.04]  Okay.
[2106.14 --> 2111.78]  So the other issue is the, the workflow and product management issue of like how to just in
[2111.78 --> 2117.78]  time this, um, how to turn our, what is right now, mostly a warehousing operation that we
[2117.78 --> 2123.84]  work with into like, like screwdriver assembly on site as well, because for the regular screwdriver
[2123.84 --> 2127.58]  assembly is actually done at pH molds where they, where they do the molding.
[2127.58 --> 2129.52]  Cause they, they like warm fit them.
[2130.24 --> 2132.30]  Um, so it pretty much is stalled.
[2132.30 --> 2136.94]  We could just, we could just do what other people have done and just find a screwdriver
[2136.94 --> 2142.66]  set and just frigging, I don't know, like put our brand, like silk screen, our brand on
[2142.66 --> 2143.12]  it or whatever.
[2143.24 --> 2143.86]  We could do that.
[2144.42 --> 2153.44]  But we, for better or for worse, often approach a product and ask ourselves, what are we adding
[2153.44 --> 2154.22]  to this category?
[2154.22 --> 2159.46]  And if the answer is not really anything, then we kind of think maybe we just shouldn't
[2159.46 --> 2159.82]  bother.
[2160.24 --> 2166.44]  Um, we are currently exploring a new way to tackle like fixed ish shaft screwdriver.
[2166.44 --> 2172.24]  So it would be like a, um, a multi-bit screwdriver, but where you swap out the entire blade.
[2172.48 --> 2179.18]  But what I told the team is, look, if it's not, if there's any wobble, then to me, it isn't
[2179.18 --> 2180.34]  worth making.
[2180.34 --> 2183.48]  Like it's not a fixed shaft screwdriver competitor at that point.
[2183.56 --> 2184.70]  So let's just not even bother.
[2184.98 --> 2189.04]  Uh, but I think, uh, Robert from the engineering team at creator warehouse has actually been
[2189.04 --> 2190.54]  making some good progress on that.
[2190.64 --> 2195.18]  So, um, maybe we'll have something to share with you guys in the next like six to 12 months,
[2195.18 --> 2196.80]  but don't hold your breath.
[2196.82 --> 2198.64]  If you need a screwdriver, go buy a screwdriver, brother.
[2198.70 --> 2203.82]  Like I'm not gonna, uh, I'm not gonna tell you it's going to be like God's gift to screwdrivers.
[2203.82 --> 2207.84]  It's, it's, if we bring something out, it'll be great because otherwise why would we bother
[2207.84 --> 2208.34]  making it?
[2208.34 --> 2214.44]  But, um, don't deprive yourself of screwdriver ownership on my accord.
[2214.88 --> 2221.34]  Uh, the last thing that I'm supposed to cover for the, um, for the LTT announcements period
[2221.34 --> 2223.40]  of the show is mod mat signups.
[2223.52 --> 2226.36]  Uh, we're getting closer to finally launching mod mat.
[2226.44 --> 2229.86]  So we just want to remind you that if you want to get notified the moment it drops, you
[2229.86 --> 2232.40]  can sign up at lmg.gg slash mod mat.
[2232.58 --> 2233.68]  It's going to be affordable.
[2233.82 --> 2235.86]  It's going to be extremely high quality.
[2235.86 --> 2238.54]  I think you guys are going to be really, really impressed by it.
[2238.88 --> 2244.00]  And I am based on how the last couple launches have gone with the scribe driver and the precision.
[2244.16 --> 2247.62]  If you aren't on the email list, you're not getting one.
[2247.96 --> 2252.42]  We should, if, if that's going to be the case, we might want to just order more stuff.
[2252.42 --> 2259.58]  Um, we're having some conversations internally around our stocking strategy.
[2259.58 --> 2267.00]  I think, um, I think that, um, the pendulum had swung pretty far toward ordering a lot of
[2267.00 --> 2271.80]  stuff and then struggling to sell through it in a reasonable amount of time because unlike
[2271.80 --> 2277.48]  like a lot of retail operations, ours is not entirely, uh, self-contained.
[2277.48 --> 2283.80]  Uh, it has convenient access to media empire cash that it can just kind of use whenever
[2283.80 --> 2284.54]  it needs it.
[2284.54 --> 2290.54]  So it has, it had gotten kind of fast and loose with how much inventory it was allowed
[2290.54 --> 2290.96]  to carry.
[2290.96 --> 2296.30]  Um, so, you know, since Taron came on, one of his major priorities has been taking care
[2296.30 --> 2297.42]  of dead and aging inventory.
[2297.98 --> 2301.58]  Um, so we have freed up a lot of cash with, uh, lime day.
[2301.82 --> 2306.10]  And, uh, there was another promo that we did last black Friday, cyber Monday.
[2306.44 --> 2308.14]  Uh, so we, we freed up a lot of cash.
[2308.14 --> 2312.42]  So we actually have a lot of stuff on order right now, and we're going to be flush with
[2312.42 --> 2314.72]  inventory and more inventory of the right things.
[2314.72 --> 2319.28]  But I think in the interim, the pendulum might've swung a little too far the other way.
[2319.28 --> 2322.94]  And we were being very conservative about our order quantities.
[2323.12 --> 2329.48]  And this is just one of those things that, you know, look, we aren't your local retailer
[2329.48 --> 2336.52]  who is taking an inventory from their regional distributor, who is taking an inventory from
[2336.52 --> 2341.48]  their, um, you know, country distributor, who is taking an inventory from the manufacturer.
[2341.48 --> 2346.92]  And there's, and there's a well-developed supply chain here that has enough excess at each
[2346.92 --> 2351.00]  stage to help smooth out any, any bumps so that nobody gaps out.
[2351.06 --> 2351.26]  Right.
[2351.62 --> 2353.56]  And, and even then things gap out.
[2353.72 --> 2358.92]  Like Intel has a controversy with a 13th, 14th gen, and they're out of stock everywhere.
[2359.04 --> 2360.02]  Nobody can, nobody can get one.
[2360.06 --> 2362.90]  Like it happens even to companies that have been doing this for decades.
[2363.24 --> 2364.36]  We haven't.
[2364.48 --> 2369.34]  So, and we don't have the benefit of, of, of these additional layers of the supply chain
[2369.34 --> 2370.32]  to help smooth things out.
[2370.32 --> 2372.08]  We are ordering directly from factories.
[2372.26 --> 2374.30]  We are creating custom products.
[2374.38 --> 2380.90]  It's not like when, when we don't have a precision screwdrivers, uh, we can just like source another
[2380.90 --> 2383.00]  one and swap it into our bit sets and ship them.
[2383.12 --> 2384.78]  We know we'll, we have to get them made.
[2384.84 --> 2385.72]  We have to get them machined.
[2385.80 --> 2388.26]  We have to source all the pieces individually.
[2388.26 --> 2390.42]  It's, um, it's, it's complicated.
[2390.60 --> 2395.94]  And so when we gap out, we tend to gap out really hard because it could be a three, four
[2395.94 --> 2399.92]  month turnaround in order to actually get everything together, get it all assembled and bring
[2399.92 --> 2400.54]  it into the store.
[2400.98 --> 2403.14]  So we're, we're gonna, we're gonna be working on that.
[2403.22 --> 2404.90]  We're gonna, we're gonna do a better job for you guys.
[2404.90 --> 2408.96]  But in the meantime, sign up for a notification from odd mat.
[2409.36 --> 2411.76]  If you want one, because otherwise you might not get one.
[2412.04 --> 2413.30]  We ordered these a while back.
[2413.50 --> 2413.88]  Okay.
[2413.88 --> 2415.48]  This says, don't read the title.
[2415.68 --> 2416.62]  Read the first point.
[2417.14 --> 2417.80]  Good job.
[2417.80 --> 2421.28]  We have a very special message from our very own Riley.
[2421.86 --> 2422.76]  Let's watch.
[2423.80 --> 2424.02]  Um.
[2424.02 --> 2424.78]  Are you doing this?
[2424.94 --> 2426.80]  You're already playing audio.
[2426.96 --> 2429.02]  So pause it from somewhere else.
[2429.30 --> 2430.34]  Uh, yes, I will.
[2430.46 --> 2431.28]  I will do that.
[2431.52 --> 2433.36]  And I made sure it worked this week.
[2433.46 --> 2433.92]  Wow.
[2434.60 --> 2435.04]  Dan.
[2435.24 --> 2436.60]  I did the bare minimum.
[2436.92 --> 2437.12]  Yay.
[2437.34 --> 2438.08]  Good job.
[2438.84 --> 2439.72]  Good job.
[2439.82 --> 2441.92]  No, I think, I think that goes beyond bare minimum.
[2442.04 --> 2443.00]  I think that's minimum.
[2444.36 --> 2445.02]  Not bare.
[2445.02 --> 2446.22]  That's a clothed minimum.
[2448.06 --> 2448.66]  Thank you.
[2451.66 --> 2452.02]  Okay.
[2452.18 --> 2452.90]  Are we doing this?
[2453.28 --> 2455.78]  I was just gonna let it kind of hang here awkwardly for a little bit.
[2455.80 --> 2456.20]  We don't have to do that.
[2456.36 --> 2456.60]  We could.
[2456.62 --> 2456.96]  We could.
[2457.34 --> 2458.28]  No, it's fine.
[2458.38 --> 2458.70]  All right.
[2458.74 --> 2459.22]  Here we go.
[2460.16 --> 2460.30]  There.
[2460.38 --> 2460.58]  Okay.
[2460.66 --> 2462.96]  So if you play that, they should hear it.
[2463.06 --> 2463.68]  You should hear it.
[2463.74 --> 2464.12]  Back flip.
[2464.18 --> 2464.70]  Watch this.
[2465.70 --> 2465.94]  Whoa.
[2467.22 --> 2468.08]  That was gnarly.
[2468.18 --> 2468.86]  Hey, you want.
[2469.70 --> 2472.50]  What the f*** just happened?
[2472.50 --> 2477.18]  I have told that guy so many times.
[2478.46 --> 2480.18]  Not at work.
[2485.06 --> 2486.32]  It was off hours.
[2486.42 --> 2487.16]  Don't worry about it.
[2488.24 --> 2488.62]  I think.
[2488.94 --> 2489.78]  Do you know?
[2490.28 --> 2492.10]  I don't think that actually makes it okay.
[2492.26 --> 2494.26]  He has disclosed this publicly.
[2494.74 --> 2496.96]  He has had like so many concussions.
[2497.66 --> 2500.70]  Every time he's like, Linus, I could do a back flip.
[2500.86 --> 2502.08]  I'm going to do a back flip.
[2502.08 --> 2503.52]  I want to do a back flip on stream.
[2503.58 --> 2504.00]  I'm going to do that.
[2504.04 --> 2506.06]  I'm like, no, no, I don't.
[2506.20 --> 2510.96]  I, it is not worth the damage you could do to your brain.
[2511.16 --> 2512.52]  How did you allow this to happen?
[2513.74 --> 2515.04]  That was not during work hours.
[2515.30 --> 2516.40]  It doesn't matter.
[2517.28 --> 2519.10]  Don't encourage this behavior.
[2519.54 --> 2521.86]  Do you know what happened last time he fell down the stairs?
[2522.74 --> 2523.46]  I don't know.
[2523.64 --> 2525.58]  He missed work for like two months.
[2525.94 --> 2527.08]  But then he blew up.
[2527.86 --> 2529.42]  Now he's beloved boy.
[2529.42 --> 2532.20]  That is not the point.
[2533.56 --> 2535.04]  What's your takeaway from that?
[2535.86 --> 2536.56]  It was a funny edit.
[2539.88 --> 2540.32]  Sorry.
[2541.54 --> 2541.94]  Okay.
[2542.18 --> 2542.88]  There you go, guys.
[2543.02 --> 2543.42]  No more.
[2543.42 --> 2546.56]  Hurting yourself at work is a path to fame here.
[2547.06 --> 2548.66]  No, I don't know.
[2548.92 --> 2549.12]  No.
[2549.30 --> 2550.78]  Yeah, that's what he made it sound like.
[2550.84 --> 2551.06]  Yes.
[2551.06 --> 2555.66]  No, I do not approve of this.
[2555.94 --> 2558.06]  Anyway, let's just finish the thing.
[2559.40 --> 2560.92]  Want to learn more fun facts about me?
[2561.02 --> 2564.14]  Tune into Floatplane for Riley Week all next week.
[2564.22 --> 2565.26]  Here's some fun clips.
[2567.66 --> 2568.90]  Got to get the blood up.
[2568.90 --> 2575.12]  The core issue with Star Wars today, as I see it, is that it's struggling to change itself.
[2575.24 --> 2576.98]  How is your Tim Cook impression so good?
[2577.18 --> 2578.56]  I don't know.
[2578.82 --> 2580.10]  The ship is not moving.
[2580.56 --> 2581.36]  Shoot the ship.
[2581.92 --> 2584.36]  What does being a minimalist actually mean?
[2584.56 --> 2585.40]  I'm going to be so loud.
[2585.48 --> 2586.38]  I'm going to be so disruptive.
[2588.14 --> 2589.04]  Bing bong.
[2589.18 --> 2590.36]  How is Riley's mom?
[2590.36 --> 2594.84]  Uh-oh.
[2596.14 --> 2598.96]  You keep my mom's name out.
[2599.14 --> 2600.30]  Wow, those were great.
[2600.38 --> 2601.14]  You want more?
[2601.34 --> 2602.54]  Subscribe to Floatplane.
[2602.74 --> 2604.62]  I'm talking to you, Linus.
[2605.58 --> 2605.80]  Do it.
[2605.80 --> 2608.30]  I'm subscribed to Floatplane.
[2610.82 --> 2611.70]  Not technically.
[2611.96 --> 2613.80]  Well, yeah, I think I'm subscribed enough.
[2614.54 --> 2614.74]  Yeah.
[2616.38 --> 2620.18]  I think when you sign the checks to the development team, you're effectively subscribed.
[2621.36 --> 2622.66]  I don't think so, actually.
[2622.70 --> 2622.94]  All right.
[2622.98 --> 2627.64]  For those of you who don't know what people weeks are, it's when we dedicate a week of
[2627.64 --> 2631.20]  floatplane exclusives to one person with the addition of an extra floatplane exclusive.
[2631.34 --> 2634.02]  So that's three extras rather than the usual two a week.
[2634.46 --> 2639.52]  Riley Week includes an 18-minute Star Wars rant, office interviews, and answering your very
[2639.52 --> 2640.98]  own questions about Riley.
[2641.36 --> 2643.02]  Can you guess which one was his idea?
[2643.68 --> 2644.74]  18-minute Star Wars rant.
[2644.92 --> 2645.40]  Oh, yeah.
[2645.64 --> 2646.88]  I like how they put a time on it.
[2646.88 --> 2652.04]  Because Riley spent an immense amount of time writing his Star Wars rant.
[2652.16 --> 2653.20]  It was six pages.
[2653.62 --> 2658.10]  So please give him love and support by going to lmg.gg slash Riley24.
[2658.56 --> 2659.34]  What does that do?
[2659.48 --> 2660.60]  I have no idea.
[2661.10 --> 2661.54]  All right.
[2661.76 --> 2663.04]  Dan, hit us with a topic.
[2663.14 --> 2663.50]  You know what?
[2663.60 --> 2664.52]  Luke, hit us with a topic.
[2664.52 --> 2665.68]  I'm going to interject here.
[2665.78 --> 2666.80]  I got a message from Sammy.
[2667.02 --> 2670.84]  The floatplane wallpapers are currently unlisted.
[2671.18 --> 2673.56]  How do you want to distribute them?
[2673.56 --> 2674.18]  We'll talk about them later.
[2674.30 --> 2675.20]  As long as it's in your brain.
[2675.64 --> 2676.34]  Another topic?
[2676.46 --> 2676.54]  Yeah.
[2677.54 --> 2677.90]  Yeah.
[2678.06 --> 2678.26]  Okay.
[2678.42 --> 2679.46]  What do you want to talk about, Luke?
[2679.88 --> 2681.70]  YouTube premium prices are on the rise?
[2682.08 --> 2684.38]  Oh, it was such a good positive show so far.
[2685.40 --> 2685.76]  Okay.
[2686.02 --> 2686.34]  Okay.
[2686.38 --> 2687.48]  Let's go with something else.
[2688.98 --> 2690.04]  Intel Lunar Lake.
[2691.36 --> 2693.50]  No, it actually looks really promising.
[2693.50 --> 2693.78]  Yeah.
[2694.14 --> 2699.14]  Multiple outlets have now benchmarked Intel's Core Ultra Series 2 or Lunar Lake CPUs, at least
[2699.14 --> 2700.72]  the Ultra 7 258V.
[2700.72 --> 2703.20]  Unintelligible product names aside.
[2703.42 --> 2703.72]  Insane.
[2703.86 --> 2709.86]  The performance appears to fall behind AMD's top end Ryzen AI 9 HX370.
[2711.80 --> 2716.06]  But it is worth noting that this isn't the most performant Lunar Lake SKU.
[2716.20 --> 2720.32]  That would be the Ultra 9 288V, but Intel didn't send that one out for comparison testing.
[2720.32 --> 2729.32]  Despite this, the Arc Graphics 140VI GPU is apparently both faster and more efficient than the Ryzen Radeon.
[2729.32 --> 2730.90]  Oh, God.
[2730.94 --> 2731.28]  What did you do?
[2731.58 --> 2733.52]  Than Ryzen's Radeon 890M.
[2733.62 --> 2739.68]  According to Notebook Check, that is only a little bit exciting.
[2739.68 --> 2746.68]  You know, I personally don't necessarily need, you know, 8% faster mobile.
[2746.80 --> 2748.00]  I mean, I won't say no to it.
[2748.42 --> 2749.34]  That's fantastic.
[2749.82 --> 2754.72]  But what actually makes me excited about that is maybe Battle Mage won't suck.
[2755.26 --> 2755.60]  Oh.
[2756.00 --> 2758.00]  Maybe Battle Mage Dedicated won't suck.
[2758.50 --> 2760.44]  Maybe NVIDIA will have some pressure on them.
[2760.52 --> 2761.50]  Come on.
[2762.16 --> 2763.42]  Come on.
[2763.42 --> 2766.78]  I really need Arc Graphics to be good.
[2767.26 --> 2773.82]  And the other thing is that the battery life apparently rivals that of the Snapdragon laptops
[2773.82 --> 2774.52]  they've tested.
[2775.14 --> 2780.42]  PC World ran it through their standard video rundown test, looping a 4K video at fixed brightness,
[2780.72 --> 2786.86]  and Lunar Lake lasted 21 hours on a 73-watt-hour battery.
[2788.12 --> 2789.56]  You know what?
[2789.60 --> 2790.24]  I gotta tell you.
[2793.42 --> 2793.68]  Okay.
[2795.46 --> 2801.30]  Framework investment aside, I never stopped using my Qualcomm laptop.
[2802.44 --> 2805.86]  Like, dude, I love, watch this.
[2806.02 --> 2806.32]  Watch this.
[2806.38 --> 2807.22]  I'm gonna show you a magic trick.
[2810.48 --> 2811.26]  Okay, just wait.
[2811.82 --> 2812.26]  Just wait.
[2812.68 --> 2813.56]  It's a good magic trick.
[2813.64 --> 2814.08]  It's a good trick.
[2814.68 --> 2815.08]  Okay, watch.
[2816.20 --> 2816.66]  Wait for it.
[2818.32 --> 2819.00]  Exciting trick.
[2819.10 --> 2819.78]  It's not a very fast trick.
[2819.78 --> 2820.12]  Look at that.
[2821.30 --> 2822.40]  It's not about the speed.
[2822.40 --> 2823.34]  It's about the quality.
[2823.42 --> 2824.14]  Of the trick.
[2824.82 --> 2826.04]  I'm a quality trick.
[2830.46 --> 2831.64]  Not fast, though.
[2832.80 --> 2833.78]  Not a fast trick.
[2836.72 --> 2837.38]  Look at that.
[2838.64 --> 2839.72]  My battery isn't dead.
[2840.26 --> 2840.56]  Yeah.
[2841.04 --> 2841.24]  Dude.
[2841.68 --> 2843.90]  If you were me, if you were me, okay?
[2844.08 --> 2846.86]  This needs so much more story around it, this trick of yours.
[2846.86 --> 2848.46]  If you were me, okay?
[2848.72 --> 2854.24]  You would know that any other laptop in my backpack, if I pulled it out, it would be dead.
[2854.44 --> 2854.92]  Oh, okay.
[2854.92 --> 2858.14]  Because I am really bad about charging it.
[2859.14 --> 2866.38]  And I just, when I'm using it, I just, like, leave it on for long periods of time, because
[2866.38 --> 2868.08]  I'll be, like, referring back to it for notes.
[2868.54 --> 2871.08]  And so it'll just, my laptop is just always dead.
[2871.22 --> 2872.10]  Except this laptop.
[2872.30 --> 2872.88]  This laptop?
[2873.46 --> 2874.20]  Always alive.
[2874.58 --> 2875.24]  I love it.
[2875.24 --> 2875.64]  It's amazing.
[2875.64 --> 2881.94]  I just have my same, like, very old, at this point, laptop that I just drag the cable
[2881.94 --> 2884.48]  around everywhere for and plug in in every room I go to.
[2885.08 --> 2885.42]  Dude.
[2885.66 --> 2886.16]  It's awesome.
[2886.52 --> 2889.20]  MacBook battery life is a game changer.
[2889.20 --> 2894.82]  And I would have loved to enjoy it for the last few years, except I just can't macOS.
[2895.20 --> 2898.52]  I'm, I'm, I just, I, I just can't, like.
[2899.42 --> 2906.50]  And the funny thing is, I think that that was only because the last time I tried or thought
[2906.50 --> 2909.32]  about it was, like, three or four years ago.
[2909.32 --> 2917.36]  Now, I probably could macOS, because pretty much everything I do has transitioned, has
[2917.36 --> 2918.60]  transitioned to a browser.
[2918.90 --> 2919.06]  Yeah.
[2919.22 --> 2925.36]  In fact, I was kind of thinking my next challenge might be a Chromebook challenge.
[2925.78 --> 2926.14]  Oh.
[2926.90 --> 2933.20]  I, I, I have never, I have never really given Chrome OS a daily driver treatment.
[2933.52 --> 2935.36]  Like, a real fair shake.
[2935.36 --> 2940.10]  Like, and these days, like, yeah, I'm using Windows, but I'm using Windows with limited
[2940.10 --> 2940.66]  compatibility.
[2941.46 --> 2945.20]  If I'm going to use something with limited compatibility, I might as well open up my
[2945.20 --> 2948.20]  horizons to Mac or Linux or Chrome OS.
[2950.64 --> 2951.52]  Not Linux yet.
[2951.60 --> 2952.62]  I'm waiting for Steam OS.
[2952.86 --> 2955.90]  I want Steam OS before I, um, Linux again.
[2955.98 --> 2957.04]  Man, the Chromebooks are cheap.
[2957.16 --> 2958.14]  What the heck?
[2958.16 --> 2959.72]  Yeah, Chromebooks cost nothing, dude.
[2959.72 --> 2965.58]  I mean, part of that is because they just use cheaper, crappier hardware.
[2965.82 --> 2968.16]  Yeah, but still, like, a hundred bucks?
[2968.54 --> 2968.78]  Yeah.
[2969.14 --> 2970.36]  I mean, that's refurbished.
[2970.44 --> 2971.26]  That's refurbished.
[2971.36 --> 2971.66]  Come on.
[2972.50 --> 2973.20]  But still, yes.
[2973.20 --> 2974.04]  I didn't actually notice that part.
[2974.16 --> 2974.68]  You're not wrong.
[2974.68 --> 2974.82]  Renewed?
[2975.02 --> 2977.24]  Is that the new, like, fun name for refurbished?
[2978.38 --> 2979.32]  Is that what that is?
[2979.32 --> 2979.52]  Yeah.
[2980.14 --> 2980.36]  Wow.
[2980.36 --> 2981.10]  It's renewed.
[2981.62 --> 2984.84]  It, it, it, it wasn't new, but now it is re-newed.
[2985.22 --> 2985.58]  Okay.
[2985.58 --> 2986.42]  It's new again.
[2986.42 --> 2989.68]  Um, that's, that shouldn't have been allowed.
[2990.68 --> 2998.06]  Anyway, in other news, for Intel, the company released another microcode update to protect
[2998.06 --> 2999.48]  Raptor Lake CPUs from crashing.
[2999.92 --> 3004.14]  Specifically, it prevents the CPU from asking for too much power when it's sitting idle or
[3004.14 --> 3005.76]  performing light tasks.
[3006.88 --> 3007.58]  Um, so yeah.
[3007.94 --> 3009.42]  Well, good luck for them.
[3009.64 --> 3012.06]  I wish them luck with all of those things.
[3012.06 --> 3016.40]  I'm, I'm actually pretty, I'm pretty, uh, I know it's stupid.
[3016.42 --> 3020.04]  And, and it, and it maybe, uh, maybe it's, no, it's not stupid.
[3020.16 --> 3025.46]  I know that it doesn't affect me personally because realistically I'm going to, I'm going
[3025.46 --> 3028.54]  to go for a 50, 80 or a 50, 90 this next gen.
[3028.62 --> 3032.28]  I, I swore I wouldn't go 40 series and I didn't.
[3032.54 --> 3038.86]  Um, but I am still running 30 series or AMD and I am, I'm, I'm ready.
[3039.06 --> 3039.38]  Battlemage?
[3039.68 --> 3040.10]  I'm ready.
[3040.56 --> 3042.52]  I don't think there's going to be a high end skew.
[3042.76 --> 3043.00]  Yeah.
[3043.00 --> 3044.94]  And I would, I would like a high end.
[3045.02 --> 3051.74]  I, we shot a sponsored video this week and again, you know, investment, sponsorship,
[3052.04 --> 3057.06]  whatever, all of that aside, I upgraded to a 480 Hertz OLED.
[3059.14 --> 3061.32]  Oh, so good.
[3062.22 --> 3064.84]  Oh, good dude.
[3064.84 --> 3068.46]  So I, I want a faster GPU.
[3069.66 --> 3075.04]  I would like a faster GPU so that I can enjoy more of that, that super high refresh rate,
[3075.12 --> 3076.26]  high frame rate goodness.
[3076.78 --> 3082.02]  Um, and I'll probably upgrade my CPU too, even though I've already got a 79 50 X, like I'm,
[3082.02 --> 3083.38]  I'm probably going to want to go X3D.
[3083.52 --> 3089.74]  What I'm hoping is that 50 series and 9000 X3D will drop it around the same time.
[3089.74 --> 3093.52]  Or I mean, well, yeah, when is a, when is a core ultra two or whatever?
[3093.64 --> 3096.54]  When, when is the desktop core ultra rumored to be landing anyway?
[3096.92 --> 3099.30]  I haven't checked lately, but I'm kind of hoping it'll all line up.
[3099.48 --> 3101.26]  Handyman is saying that there's 50, 90 leaks.
[3101.96 --> 3102.30]  Oh yeah.
[3102.42 --> 3102.70]  Oh yeah.
[3102.72 --> 3105.62]  It's supposed to be like, we don't really do leaks on Wancho anymore.
[3105.74 --> 3108.32]  I don't know if you guys noticed that we don't really like do rumor miller leaks,
[3108.44 --> 3109.34]  but I don't even know that.
[3109.42 --> 3109.58]  Yeah.
[3109.68 --> 3110.94]  Well, I mean, we don't.
[3111.02 --> 3111.54]  It's just because.
[3111.94 --> 3112.16]  Yeah.
[3112.26 --> 3112.78]  You're not wrong.
[3112.96 --> 3113.74]  It's just because we don't care.
[3113.94 --> 3115.50]  Like we can talk about it once it's out.
[3115.60 --> 3116.08]  Pretty true.
[3116.08 --> 3120.08]  And a lot of the time, the problem with us reporting on leaks is that we would like,
[3120.16 --> 3120.34]  no.
[3121.10 --> 3124.04]  So it created a bit of a weird.
[3124.04 --> 3128.90]  It does get a little muddy trying to remember what you read online versus what you were told.
[3129.06 --> 3129.46]  Yeah.
[3129.60 --> 3131.08]  And knowing where the line is.
[3131.22 --> 3131.50]  Yeah.
[3131.64 --> 3132.44]  It is a little sketch.
[3132.50 --> 3134.82]  I don't know anything firsthand about 50, 90 though.
[3134.92 --> 3137.50]  So what I heard is that it's supposed to be 600 watts.
[3138.18 --> 3142.20]  But, but a real, a real daddy chip though.
[3142.46 --> 3144.06]  So 512 bit bus.
[3144.40 --> 3144.76]  Whoa.
[3144.76 --> 3146.40]  32 gigs GDDR7.
[3146.48 --> 3147.86]  That's, that's the current rumor, but.
[3148.28 --> 3150.32]  Are they going to put real power cables into it?
[3150.78 --> 3153.30]  Uh, no, it's probably still going to be.
[3153.94 --> 3158.42]  I heard they might even do two of the high voltage power connectors.
[3158.62 --> 3159.62]  So we'll see how that goes.
[3161.66 --> 3162.88]  What else we got today?
[3166.48 --> 3169.12]  Did we actually do all the announcements?
[3169.24 --> 3169.88]  I don't think we did.
[3169.98 --> 3170.32]  Did we do?
[3170.64 --> 3172.08]  No, but let's give them a break from announcements.
[3172.08 --> 3173.76]  There's a lot of announcements this week.
[3174.02 --> 3174.24]  Cool.
[3174.24 --> 3175.28]  Uh, U.S.
[3175.36 --> 3179.50]  Bans Chinese cars and Kaspersky becomes the malware.
[3179.86 --> 3184.52]  Uh, the current White House administration is planning to ban certain hardware and software
[3184.52 --> 3190.40]  made in China and Russia from vehicles due to the risks of surveillance and sabotage.
[3190.40 --> 3198.26]  The official press release expresses concern that foreign adversaries could gather information on both American citizens and critical infrastructure.
[3198.46 --> 3198.78]  Valid.
[3198.78 --> 3198.94]  Valid.
[3198.94 --> 3202.46]  Perhaps to disrupt the operations of said infrastructure.
[3202.68 --> 3202.94]  Valid.
[3202.94 --> 3212.30]  The proposal specifically mentions banning automated driving systems, suggesting the White House fears vehicles themselves could be used for possible sabotage.
[3212.72 --> 3215.82]  Um, somebody watched a little bit of Fast and the Furious.
[3216.22 --> 3226.44]  Uh, around the same time, Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky, uh, started uninstalling its antivirus software from American computers to comply with its own U.S. ban.
[3226.44 --> 3232.26]  But the company also installed a different antivirus software on said computers.
[3232.26 --> 3244.26]  While Kaspersky did tell customers via email their existing subscriptions would be transferred to alternative antivirus software, Ultra AV, users claimed the auto installation wasn't mentioned.
[3244.26 --> 3255.10]  However, Pango Group, owner of Ultra AV, claims that Kaspersky communicated the transition to users starting on September 5th, including an in-app pop-up stating,
[3255.56 --> 3259.18]  Ultra AV protection will be automatically activated on your device.
[3260.04 --> 3263.78]  Which, uh, I would immediately think that my computer had been...
[3263.78 --> 3264.18]  Oh, yeah.
[3264.52 --> 3265.52]  ...hatched to all heck.
[3265.60 --> 3266.32]  100%.
[3266.32 --> 3266.64]  So when you unplug it and just throw it out the window.
[3266.64 --> 3270.34]  Ultra AV protection doesn't even sound like, uh, like a real thing.
[3270.44 --> 3271.16]  No, not at all.
[3271.16 --> 3279.96]  Like, I, I'm, I'm sure it is, but it's not what we use and we have a team of people who determines what antivirus we use, so that's not something I've looked into a lot personally.
[3280.24 --> 3287.28]  I'm just saying that if you don't follow, you know, the antivirus industry, that could easily sound like a...
[3287.28 --> 3288.48]  Yeah, that sounds like fake.
[3288.74 --> 3290.82]  To be fair, a few of them do sound kind of fake.
[3291.36 --> 3291.72]  Um...
[3291.72 --> 3291.88]  Yeah.
[3292.54 --> 3293.30]  This is true.
[3294.10 --> 3295.62]  So, so, some...
[3295.62 --> 3296.04]  How...
[3296.04 --> 3296.80]  Crowd strike!
[3297.00 --> 3297.86]  Do you know...
[3297.86 --> 3298.78]  Sentinel won!
[3299.24 --> 3300.62]  They're all, like, so intense.
[3301.16 --> 3303.48]  Do you know how many years I called, uh...
[3303.48 --> 3305.56]  Um...
[3305.56 --> 3306.24]  Ah, no, never mind.
[3306.32 --> 3306.54]  Go ahead.
[3307.04 --> 3309.48]  Ninja won and Sentinel won, also being from two different companies.
[3309.70 --> 3310.36]  Blows my mind.
[3310.48 --> 3310.74]  Yeah.
[3310.94 --> 3311.06]  Insomely.
[3311.32 --> 3311.64]  Anyways.
[3312.32 --> 3312.96]  Um...
[3312.96 --> 3314.12]  Da, da, da, da, da.
[3314.14 --> 3315.10]  Some users were...
[3315.10 --> 3318.10]  Vicka says I'm pro IT and I've never heard of it, so I don't even feel that bad.
[3318.28 --> 3318.46]  Yeah.
[3318.98 --> 3325.04]  Uh, some users were especially freaked out because after using a third-party uninstaller app to completely remove Ultra AV,
[3325.04 --> 3327.86]  it just reinstalled itself after they rebooted.
[3328.42 --> 3328.86]  Whoa!
[3329.64 --> 3330.28]  Very cool.
[3330.48 --> 3331.62]  That is actual malware.
[3331.98 --> 3332.42]  Very cool.
[3332.42 --> 3333.92]  That is the definition of malware.
[3334.48 --> 3338.84]  Something that installs itself without user intervention and without user consent.
[3338.94 --> 3339.36]  I mean...
[3340.08 --> 3341.28]  Is that not malware?
[3341.56 --> 3342.62]  Well, it could be a form...
[3342.62 --> 3345.86]  Like, in their defense, it could be a form of...
[3345.86 --> 3348.96]  Like, it said a third-party uninstaller app, right?
[3349.06 --> 3350.40]  So it could be a defense.
[3353.98 --> 3357.86]  If you're an antivirus, do you want third-party uninstaller apps to be able to uninstall you?
[3358.04 --> 3358.34]  Yeah.
[3358.46 --> 3358.94]  Probably not.
[3360.06 --> 3360.72]  I will...
[3360.72 --> 3361.10]  I will...
[3361.10 --> 3363.22]  In their defense, I will put that out there.
[3365.08 --> 3367.50]  Like, if you use the actual uninstaller...
[3367.50 --> 3368.46]  I'd still be freaked out.
[3368.66 --> 3369.00]  Yes.
[3369.68 --> 3370.08]  100%.
[3370.08 --> 3372.14]  But I think I kind of get it.
[3372.14 --> 3377.06]  Especially if I knew anything about, like, you know, Kaspersky and the whole situation
[3377.06 --> 3381.20]  that's gone down with them and why they, like, aren't allowed in the United States anymore
[3381.20 --> 3382.12]  and stuff.
[3382.24 --> 3384.94]  Just the whole thing feeling sketchy.
[3385.14 --> 3385.64]  You know?
[3385.76 --> 3386.00]  Yeah.
[3387.92 --> 3388.32]  Okay.
[3390.08 --> 3390.84]  There's a...
[3390.84 --> 3391.06]  Yeah.
[3391.26 --> 3392.56]  There's a...
[3392.56 --> 3396.48]  There's a work conversation buried in there somewhere, but we'll deal with that another
[3396.48 --> 3396.82]  time.
[3399.60 --> 3400.72]  Reboot remaster update?
[3400.88 --> 3401.14]  Yeah.
[3401.22 --> 3402.04]  We could talk about that.
[3402.14 --> 3403.68]  Did we talk about that on the show, Dan?
[3404.00 --> 3404.68]  I don't think so.
[3404.72 --> 3404.96]  He doesn't...
[3404.96 --> 3409.54]  It was a topic for last week, but we didn't get to it, so it's continued into this week.
[3409.56 --> 3409.96]  That's right.
[3410.00 --> 3410.24]  Okay.
[3410.28 --> 3411.16]  Let's talk about it.
[3411.94 --> 3415.92]  We have been in the background providing a little bit of assistance.
[3415.92 --> 3420.02]  I don't want to give ourselves credit for the restoration because that goes to other
[3420.02 --> 3421.34]  people, but we've been trying to help.
[3421.82 --> 3426.50]  We've been trying to help Mark from Disappearing Inc. and the Reboot Rewind documentary team
[3426.50 --> 3432.60]  with their project to create high-quality versions of the classic 1994 CGI TV series Reboot.
[3432.60 --> 3437.80]  A few months ago, we reached out to the community for help getting the D1 machines in their possession
[3437.80 --> 3438.16]  running.
[3438.16 --> 3443.82]  They have since given us an update on their progress and some side-by-side comparison
[3443.82 --> 3444.52]  screenshots!
[3444.52 --> 3451.42]  They have one of three D1 machines running, and they have captured a few of the 200-plus
[3451.42 --> 3451.78]  tapes.
[3452.20 --> 3456.74]  The tapes do require some tender love and care because the magnetic media is showing
[3456.74 --> 3461.12]  signs of degradation, which is a good reminder of how physical media will degrade over time,
[3461.20 --> 3464.20]  and modernization is always an ongoing effort.
[3464.20 --> 3468.48]  We have sourced and now possess a full schematic set and user manual.
[3468.76 --> 3472.64]  Huge thanks to the community for all the leads, and a good reminder to support archival
[3472.64 --> 3473.00]  sites.
[3473.58 --> 3478.00]  And the tapes and the contents are still the property of the original studio mainframe,
[3478.26 --> 3481.84]  so the captured results are released as approved by mainframe.
[3481.96 --> 3483.92]  This is their intellectual property.
[3484.04 --> 3490.30]  But we do have some comparison images that I would be happy to show to you guys.
[3490.50 --> 3491.42]  Check this out.
[3491.42 --> 3492.48]  Here we go.
[3492.48 --> 3493.48]  Damn!
[3498.60 --> 3499.60]  Do the slider.
[3499.74 --> 3500.22]  Do the slider.
[3500.48 --> 3501.36]  It's a slider.
[3501.66 --> 3502.44]  Oh yeah, here we go.
[3502.48 --> 3502.78]  Here we go.
[3502.82 --> 3503.20]  Here we go.
[3503.26 --> 3505.44]  It's insanely better.
[3505.56 --> 3506.08]  Dude!
[3506.90 --> 3507.46]  Wow.
[3507.70 --> 3511.16]  This is what the artist, this is what the artist created.
[3511.40 --> 3515.92]  This is what 1994 technology could do via broadcast.
[3516.50 --> 3516.98]  Dude.
[3517.34 --> 3518.34]  Dude, they look...
[3518.34 --> 3519.38]  That is so sick.
[3519.38 --> 3520.94]  They look so good.
[3520.94 --> 3522.56]  That's wicked.
[3523.56 --> 3523.84]  Dude.
[3524.20 --> 3524.84]  Dude, dude, dude, dude.
[3524.96 --> 3525.72]  Stuff like this.
[3525.90 --> 3526.18]  Oh!
[3526.90 --> 3528.16]  Look how sharp that is!
[3528.68 --> 3529.90]  Look how sharp that is!
[3530.36 --> 3530.94]  I need...
[3531.82 --> 3533.78]  I need to rewatch this.
[3534.04 --> 3536.90]  Here's the first remastered episode on YouTube.
[3537.14 --> 3538.58]  Hopefully we don't get in trouble for this.
[3539.02 --> 3539.94]  Because, like...
[3539.94 --> 3540.64]  Please don't.
[3540.70 --> 3541.14]  Like, we...
[3541.14 --> 3542.74]  I swear we did help a little bit.
[3542.80 --> 3544.68]  We didn't do that much, but we did help a little bit.
[3544.74 --> 3545.34]  So please don't.
[3546.62 --> 3546.98]  Dude!
[3546.98 --> 3547.18]  Dude!
[3548.86 --> 3554.78]  Even me watching through YouTube, and you guys watching through my crappy stream, you guys
[3554.78 --> 3557.18]  are gonna be able to see that this is...
[3557.18 --> 3557.80]  So much better.
[3557.88 --> 3559.92]  So much better.
[3559.92 --> 3559.98]  So much better.
[3562.98 --> 3564.08]  Absolutely sick.
[3564.16 --> 3564.42]  Yeah, yeah.
[3564.48 --> 3564.86]  It's in HD.
[3566.82 --> 3567.26]  Ah!
[3568.08 --> 3568.96]  So exciting.
[3568.96 --> 3574.26]  We are extremely happy to be even a small part of this restoration effort.
[3574.38 --> 3577.84]  So massive shout-out to the Reboot Rewind documentary team and Mark from Disappearing Inc.
[3579.60 --> 3581.54]  What else we got for this week, Mr. Luke?
[3582.00 --> 3583.12]  Do you want to do a couple...
[3583.12 --> 3583.46]  Oh!
[3583.72 --> 3584.12]  No.
[3584.28 --> 3584.56]  iPhone?
[3584.96 --> 3586.32]  It's time for me to get mad.
[3586.56 --> 3586.78]  Oh.
[3587.66 --> 3588.46]  Uh-oh.
[3588.60 --> 3594.92]  It was brought to our attention, so shout-out to the subreddit, that Ghost Keyboards used
[3594.92 --> 3600.74]  a photo of me alongside a falsely attributed quote endorsing their product.
[3600.86 --> 3602.92]  I'm actually just gonna try and find...
[3604.48 --> 3607.96]  Let me see if I can track this down.
[3608.20 --> 3608.66]  Here it is.
[3608.74 --> 3609.90]  I can get it in the dock if you need.
[3609.96 --> 3610.14]  Okay.
[3610.86 --> 3613.50]  Got this ad from Ghost Keyboards.
[3614.40 --> 3614.92]  So this...
[3616.36 --> 3621.66]  Best keyboard I have ever used with, like, kind of, you know, creepy mustache, Photoshop
[3621.66 --> 3622.10]  thing.
[3622.10 --> 3623.32]  This is from...
[3623.32 --> 3630.98]  This is a capture from Elijah's AMD Ultimate Tech Upgrade, and they are promoting this keyboard,
[3631.28 --> 3633.72]  and they did a sale on it or whatever else.
[3633.94 --> 3635.16]  So here's the situation.
[3635.66 --> 3641.72]  If this was just, like, a meme, and obviously fake, and just posted on their Instagram, which
[3641.72 --> 3645.42]  they did also post it on Instagram, that would be one thing.
[3645.42 --> 3646.42]  Um...
[3646.42 --> 3654.30]  In my opinion, it was not obviously enough fake, for one thing.
[3655.16 --> 3655.42]  Um...
[3656.22 --> 3659.98]  For another thing, the quote, okay?
[3660.04 --> 3663.98]  If it was just the image, it's already our intellectual property being used for commercial
[3663.98 --> 3664.40]  purposes.
[3664.52 --> 3667.32]  That is absolutely not fair use.
[3667.32 --> 3668.32]  Um...
[3668.32 --> 3674.76]  The quote makes it much worse, because not only in that video did I not say it was the
[3674.76 --> 3676.12]  best keyboard I had ever used.
[3676.60 --> 3685.24]  I advocated against buying it, and I discussed with Elijah that I felt that it was not very
[3685.24 --> 3686.70]  good quality for the money.
[3687.54 --> 3688.64]  So that's issue number two.
[3688.64 --> 3695.76]  Issue number three is that, aside from them posting it as a meme on their Instagram or
[3695.76 --> 3702.62]  whatever else, there was a clear call to action for people to purchase this keyboard based on
[3702.62 --> 3703.04]  the image.
[3703.40 --> 3711.70]  And issue number four is that it was also sent, soliciting members of their email mailing list
[3711.70 --> 3714.04]  to buy the keyboard...
[3714.04 --> 3716.10]  Yeah, to purchase the keyboard.
[3716.10 --> 3726.90]  This goes so far beyond sort of, we didn't know better, or like, uh, engagement bait, or
[3726.90 --> 3734.16]  community engagement, or, or, you know, soft collaboration, or whatever the case may be.
[3734.68 --> 3738.88]  Um, I know that there's a number of people internally who thought it was funny.
[3739.26 --> 3740.78]  I didn't think it was funny.
[3740.78 --> 3748.00]  I think that if it was clearly marked that I did not think the keyboard was a good value,
[3748.12 --> 3752.48]  I did not think that it was something that people should buy, and if they were kind of
[3752.48 --> 3758.56]  memeing on that, Linus says, don't buy this keyboard, uh, we disagree, buy it, whatever
[3758.56 --> 3758.90]  else.
[3758.98 --> 3763.10]  There was potentially angles where this could kind of work.
[3763.14 --> 3765.64]  At the very least, we should have gotten a heads up.
[3765.64 --> 3767.08]  We didn't.
[3767.40 --> 3768.98]  It just appeared.
[3770.10 --> 3773.82]  Um, not cool.
[3775.12 --> 3778.98]  They have done at least one thing right since then.
[3779.26 --> 3782.84]  Um, Colton reached out to them via LinkedIn, I believe.
[3783.30 --> 3787.28]  Uh, they apologized, and they have removed the post from Instagram.
[3787.28 --> 3792.98]  Um, I personally think there should be a public retraction and a correction of the record.
[3793.78 --> 3795.80]  I would like to see that happen.
[3796.52 --> 3801.98]  Um, oh, it's ghost keyboards, those of you asking who exactly this was.
[3802.76 --> 3809.36]  Um, at this point, you know, if that doesn't happen, then I'm not going to, I'm not going
[3809.36 --> 3811.96]  to threaten any form of legal action or whatever else it is.
[3812.00 --> 3813.88]  They've already removed the offending material.
[3813.88 --> 3820.74]  However, I consider this a pretty solid first strike here, and I don't think we'd be open
[3820.74 --> 3826.48]  to collaborating with them in any way, any form, until they have publicly set the record
[3826.48 --> 3827.32]  straight on this.
[3827.52 --> 3828.44]  Um, not cool.
[3828.68 --> 3829.20]  Ghost keyboards.
[3829.48 --> 3829.96]  Not cool.
[3833.74 --> 3834.74]  What else we got?
[3835.64 --> 3838.04]  Uh, iPhones are, like, repairable or something?
[3838.42 --> 3838.82]  Dude.
[3838.98 --> 3839.82]  That's really cool.
[3839.82 --> 3843.76]  iPhone 16 got a 7 out of 10 repairability score from iFixit.
[3843.76 --> 3844.36]  That's crazy.
[3844.48 --> 3848.32]  Apple has launched its iPhone 16 lineup, which has demonstrated a significant improvement
[3848.32 --> 3850.72]  over the iPhone 15 in terms of repairability.
[3851.14 --> 3857.04]  iFixit has given the 16 and 16 plus a rating of 7 out of 10 compared to the 4 out of 10 that
[3857.04 --> 3858.02]  it gave to their predecessors.
[3859.00 --> 3861.08]  It's an actually, like, enormous jump.
[3861.60 --> 3865.34]  Uh, perhaps the most notable change is to the device's battery adhesive.
[3865.56 --> 3866.22]  This is so cool.
[3866.32 --> 3868.70]  Adhesive debonds on command.
[3868.90 --> 3869.68]  This is so cool.
[3869.68 --> 3871.92]  This is genuinely very cool.
[3872.10 --> 3873.94]  When an electric current is run through it.
[3873.94 --> 3874.62]  It's so cool.
[3874.84 --> 3875.12]  Dude.
[3876.18 --> 3876.62]  Sorry.
[3876.76 --> 3876.96]  Sorry.
[3877.06 --> 3877.52]  I interrupted.
[3877.66 --> 3878.02]  No, it's fine.
[3878.12 --> 3878.84]  No, I'm going to interrupt.
[3879.06 --> 3879.32]  Okay.
[3879.32 --> 3889.08]  I get so angry when I see Apple reinventing the wheel just to, like, screw people over.
[3889.20 --> 3889.64]  This is sick.
[3889.64 --> 3895.00]  Just to make the device incompatible with a third-party, you know, version that costs a
[3895.00 --> 3895.54]  third as much.
[3895.78 --> 3896.02]  You know?
[3896.02 --> 3903.86]  Apple has colossal, monumental, enormous engineering resources at their disposal.
[3904.14 --> 3910.48]  And when they use it to work against the interests of the consumer, it drives me absolutely
[3910.48 --> 3914.78]  crazy because this is what they could have been doing.
[3914.92 --> 3916.14]  That is so cool.
[3916.26 --> 3916.78]  So cool.
[3916.92 --> 3918.46]  That is so cool.
[3919.86 --> 3920.42]  Huh.
[3920.92 --> 3921.44]  Okay, go ahead.
[3921.44 --> 3929.48]  While this will require users to acquire a new tool, it allows for a clean, easily repeatable
[3929.48 --> 3934.76]  process for removing the battery that limits the potential for unintentional damage during
[3934.76 --> 3935.06]  repair.
[3935.08 --> 3936.24]  And it makes it safer.
[3937.44 --> 3943.14]  Those pillow batteries, they can be extremely dangerous if they're bent too much or they're
[3943.14 --> 3943.62]  punctured.
[3943.62 --> 3944.50]  If they're punctured.
[3945.06 --> 3948.54]  This improves safety, not just, not for the user.
[3948.80 --> 3950.20]  This time it's for the technician.
[3950.20 --> 3954.14]  It's out of consideration of the people who work on these bloody things.
[3955.54 --> 3958.84]  Apparently the adhesive tape is a product.
[3959.44 --> 3960.12]  I don't care.
[3960.22 --> 3960.84]  It doesn't really matter.
[3961.06 --> 3961.62]  I don't care.
[3962.34 --> 3964.44]  They integrated it into their device.
[3964.54 --> 3965.68]  They did the validation.
[3966.40 --> 3967.80]  They did the work.
[3967.90 --> 3968.38]  It's done.
[3968.54 --> 3969.60]  It's in the product.
[3969.88 --> 3971.24]  It benefits the user.
[3971.42 --> 3972.16]  I love it.
[3972.16 --> 3976.70]  The removal process is similar to jumping a car battery and requires a pair of alligator
[3976.70 --> 3980.28]  clip leads attached to a 12 to 30 volt power source.
[3980.28 --> 3985.46]  The user attaches the black cable to a grounding screw near the phone's charging port, then
[3985.46 --> 3988.40]  attaches the red cable to a special tab on the battery.
[3989.20 --> 3989.50]  Really?
[3989.50 --> 3995.26]  The current will cause a chemical reaction that debonds the adhesive and allows the battery
[3995.26 --> 3999.70]  to easily detach from the device after around a minute and a half.
[4000.14 --> 4005.34]  These batteries also use a hard steel case instead of a soft pouch, reducing the possibility
[4005.34 --> 4006.12]  of puncturing the battery.
[4006.28 --> 4006.92]  Also cool.
[4007.44 --> 4012.64]  Dude, are we on the timeline where Apple goes back to like battery packs?
[4012.64 --> 4015.60]  I mean, we're slowly making our way there.
[4015.72 --> 4016.52]  I'd be down with it.
[4017.30 --> 4023.06]  There's so many times that like I catch myself constantly walking around with my phone tethered
[4023.06 --> 4023.98]  to a battery bank.
[4024.20 --> 4025.90]  It apparently works with lower voltages.
[4026.26 --> 4028.44]  You can just use a nine volt battery and just...
[4028.44 --> 4031.02]  If you can do that, then you don't really need a special tool.
[4031.08 --> 4031.58]  So cool.
[4031.76 --> 4031.96]  Yeah.
[4032.08 --> 4032.78]  So cool.
[4032.88 --> 4033.52]  Which is awesome.
[4034.78 --> 4041.50]  The Pro's battery doesn't feature the new adhesive, but does have the steel case.
[4041.50 --> 4043.92]  The Pro Max has no battery improvements.
[4044.86 --> 4045.04]  Really?
[4045.50 --> 4048.10]  Probably because they stuffed as much battery in as possible.
[4048.40 --> 4050.94]  That thing gets 27 hours of video playback.
[4051.16 --> 4051.70]  Holy crap.
[4051.72 --> 4051.94]  Yeah.
[4052.60 --> 4053.82]  So, okay.
[4054.06 --> 4061.00]  Nonetheless, both now incorporate the dual entry design that debuted with the iPhone 14,
[4061.18 --> 4066.48]  which allows the phone to be opened from the front or the back, which allows many repairs
[4066.48 --> 4069.04]  to avoid removing the fragile screen, which is cool.
[4069.04 --> 4072.56]  So iOS 18 also has a new repair assistant.
[4072.76 --> 4078.02]  While the feature is currently a little buggy, it allows users to independently calibrate replacement
[4078.02 --> 4079.86]  parts so that the device will recognize them.
[4080.02 --> 4080.28]  That's cool.
[4080.46 --> 4081.08]  That is cool.
[4081.40 --> 4086.10]  The company is also making device repairs easier by no longer requiring the device's serial
[4086.10 --> 4091.30]  number in some cases, adding a section of settings that shows users the history of
[4091.30 --> 4092.52]  the device's parts and repairs.
[4092.66 --> 4093.38]  That's cool.
[4093.48 --> 4093.60]  Yeah.
[4093.60 --> 4093.86]  Why not?
[4094.26 --> 4099.86]  It's also introducing an anti-theft feature to block the repair if the new part was from
[4099.86 --> 4102.52]  a phone that had been reported as lost or stolen.
[4104.00 --> 4105.06]  I'm also down with that.
[4105.06 --> 4105.08]  Okay.
[4105.08 --> 4109.74]  It started off with Apple just, you know, fixing its own problem that it created and
[4109.74 --> 4110.52]  then ended pretty cool.
[4110.66 --> 4110.90]  Yeah.
[4111.08 --> 4112.44]  If they can actually enforce this.
[4112.52 --> 4119.04]  I mean, that's the thing about, you know, sleazy, you know, black market people is they're
[4119.04 --> 4120.12]  going to find a way around this.
[4120.34 --> 4121.96]  But hey, you know what?
[4121.96 --> 4126.92]  This overall seems like what they're doing is good.
[4127.40 --> 4127.48]  Yes.
[4127.70 --> 4134.56]  And to the benefit of their customer rather than just to milk their customer.
[4135.20 --> 4141.46]  I mean, they are going to milk you, but they're going to at least milk you to your benefit.
[4142.70 --> 4144.72]  It's a mutually beneficial milking.
[4144.72 --> 4155.12]  What are we supposed to be talking about?
[4155.36 --> 4157.24]  Should we talk about the last?
[4157.24 --> 4157.88]  Oh my God.
[4157.92 --> 4159.08]  We haven't done sponsors yet.
[4159.56 --> 4159.82]  Okay.
[4159.94 --> 4161.40]  The show is brought to you by Remotely.
[4161.88 --> 4167.18]  Being the only person with technology in your family can be a super obnoxious thing when
[4167.18 --> 4170.44]  grandma calls wondering how to check the Facebooks.
[4170.74 --> 4174.08]  But thankfully, there's our sponsor Remotely.
[4174.08 --> 4179.22]  Remotely offers secure remote desktop software so you can connect to your home PC whenever
[4179.22 --> 4180.16]  and wherever.
[4180.64 --> 4184.84]  It uses its own private relay server and connection cloud, ensuring your connection meets the highest
[4184.84 --> 4185.78]  encryption standards.
[4186.16 --> 4190.14]  Whether you're helping mom troubleshoot, need to work from home, or even if you need to
[4190.14 --> 4193.18]  game from the office, Remotely has you covered.
[4193.48 --> 4197.08]  It supports up to 4K resolution, HDR10, and...
[4197.88 --> 4198.26]  Okay.
[4198.54 --> 4201.84]  This says zero latency, and that should not have made its way into our talking points.
[4201.84 --> 4208.04]  It's very low latency in direct P2P connections while also providing reliable and fast cloud
[4208.04 --> 4208.52]  connections.
[4208.98 --> 4212.84]  Currently, it's available on Windows and Android with macOS and iOS versions coming in 2025.
[4213.32 --> 4216.22]  And to make things even better, their free version is not time-gated.
[4216.70 --> 4217.90]  It's actually free.
[4218.40 --> 4221.60]  Remotely offers solid pricing for both home and business users, and you can check them out
[4221.60 --> 4223.26]  at the link in the video description.

[4282.60 --> 4286.14]  Do you know why your IT team is always glued to their desks, looking like they're in the
[4286.14 --> 4287.04]  middle of diffusing a bomb?
[4287.44 --> 4291.62]  It's because they're too busy wrestling with 47 different systems and resetting Colton's
[4291.62 --> 4293.08]  password for the 12th time this week.
[4293.32 --> 4296.18]  But thanks to our sponsor, JumpCloud, they can finally take a breather.

[4333.24 --> 4333.68]  All right.
[4333.70 --> 4335.48]  We're supposed to do three merch messages now, apparently.
[4335.68 --> 4336.14]  Thank you, Dan.
[4336.74 --> 4337.58]  You're welcome.
[4338.22 --> 4340.12]  How's your fingies doing this week?
[4340.34 --> 4340.88]  They're pretty good.
[4340.94 --> 4342.46]  We've sold a lot of cargo pants.
[4342.58 --> 4342.72]  Yeah.
[4342.72 --> 4343.82]  People seem to like them.
[4343.96 --> 4344.22]  Yeah.
[4344.46 --> 4345.26]  Cargo pants.
[4345.34 --> 4345.96]  They seem good.
[4346.02 --> 4348.22]  So far, I've been sitting in them for about two hours.
[4348.34 --> 4348.66]  They're comfy.
[4349.48 --> 4349.94]  That's good.
[4350.48 --> 4350.98]  That's good.
[4350.98 --> 4351.34]  Nice.
[4351.76 --> 4356.02]  Luke didn't get any of the pre-production samples, so he's just trying them now.
[4356.24 --> 4356.46]  Yeah.
[4356.86 --> 4357.18]  Correct.
[4357.86 --> 4358.32]  Oh, no.
[4358.32 --> 4359.16]  On the topic of...
[4359.16 --> 4359.74]  Oh, no.
[4359.88 --> 4360.54]  Here it comes.
[4360.60 --> 4361.60]  No, I was going to save that for later.
[4361.80 --> 4362.04]  Oh.
[4362.28 --> 4362.58]  All right.
[4363.72 --> 4364.22]  Oh, fine.
[4364.26 --> 4364.48]  What?
[4364.74 --> 4366.48]  Luke, how is Star Wars Outlaws?
[4366.58 --> 4366.94]  Ah!
[4367.48 --> 4367.88]  Ah!
[4367.88 --> 4368.24]  Ah!
[4369.02 --> 4369.64]  Last week.
[4370.16 --> 4374.30]  Those of you who don't have the context, last week, Luke was like, oh, yeah, why is it
[4374.30 --> 4374.80]  last week?
[4374.94 --> 4375.38]  I think so.
[4375.46 --> 4377.04]  Why is everybody hating so hard on this?
[4377.06 --> 4381.10]  I fired it up, and I went around the, like, opening area, and it seems pretty good, and
[4381.10 --> 4384.36]  I logged off, and then this week, he showed up on WAN Show Set.
[4384.42 --> 4386.44]  He goes, I logged back in, and...
[4386.44 --> 4386.90]  I'm bored.
[4389.30 --> 4391.78]  The lockpicking mechanic is amazing.
[4392.08 --> 4393.28]  I will die on that hill.
[4393.28 --> 4395.22]  The lockpicking mechanic is incredible.
[4395.22 --> 4398.20]  It's the best one I've ever ran into in a game, ever.
[4398.90 --> 4399.30]  Personally.
[4400.32 --> 4401.10]  It's great.
[4402.54 --> 4410.28]  And then, you start needing to do more stuff in the game at all, and it's like, ah...
[4410.28 --> 4411.88]  Okay.
[4412.68 --> 4413.38]  I'm done.
[4414.14 --> 4414.56]  I don't know.
[4414.64 --> 4416.52]  It's like, it's very much...
[4416.52 --> 4422.64]  You know that old, like, meme about MMOs, where they're like, ah, yes, here's a new quest.
[4422.64 --> 4424.54]  Get me that book across the room.
[4424.96 --> 4425.06]  Yeah.
[4425.06 --> 4426.54]  And then you have to walk over and grab it and bring it back.
[4426.64 --> 4427.74]  It's very much like...
[4427.74 --> 4429.38]  It's like, why don't you use the Force to get it?
[4429.68 --> 4430.08]  Yeah.
[4430.50 --> 4431.34]  You jackass.
[4431.42 --> 4431.76]  Yeah.
[4431.96 --> 4433.52]  It's just like, I don't know.
[4433.70 --> 4434.98]  It's...
[4434.98 --> 4440.90]  I don't think it's as bad as most people are saying, but it's...
[4440.90 --> 4442.18]  I don't know.
[4442.46 --> 4443.04]  It's okay.
[4444.26 --> 4444.52]  Cool.
[4444.64 --> 4445.80]  That's a ringing endorsement.
[4445.82 --> 4446.36]  It's fine.
[4446.50 --> 4448.54]  For a, like, $70, $80 game.
[4448.74 --> 4448.94]  Yeah.
[4448.94 --> 4452.78]  I mean, it's better than a lot of other Star Wars stuff coming out.
[4453.38 --> 4454.38]  A ringing endorsement.
[4454.38 --> 4458.94]  But yeah, I don't know.
[4460.66 --> 4462.68]  Get the Sabacc cheats if you haven't already.
[4462.88 --> 4466.32]  What I'm probably going to do now is not launch it again.
[4466.96 --> 4467.76]  Uninstall it.
[4467.92 --> 4468.62]  Best mod.
[4470.06 --> 4471.98]  Just, I've got other things going on.
[4472.06 --> 4475.52]  I don't have the time for games that are all right right now, unfortunately.
[4475.52 --> 4477.52]  But...
[4477.52 --> 4479.66]  Yeah.
[4479.80 --> 4480.38]  I don't know.
[4480.98 --> 4483.18]  Maybe I'll play it again someday, but...
[4483.18 --> 4484.08]  You probably won't.
[4484.14 --> 4485.34]  How's Final Fantasy VI going?
[4486.08 --> 4486.48]  Good.
[4486.78 --> 4488.08]  Enjoying it more than...
[4488.08 --> 4489.42]  What is it even called?
[4489.50 --> 4489.86]  Outlaws?
[4490.16 --> 4490.40]  Yeah.
[4490.46 --> 4491.42]  Oh, how far are you now?
[4492.80 --> 4493.54]  Where am I?
[4493.76 --> 4495.44]  Thanks for helping me keep him accountable.
[4495.44 --> 4495.96]  Yeah.
[4495.96 --> 4498.96]  I finished all of my stuff, like, a year ago.
[4498.98 --> 4500.10]  You had so much less stuff to do.
[4500.10 --> 4501.52]  Like, a year ago, though.
[4501.70 --> 4502.26]  That's fair.
[4502.62 --> 4504.50]  Dude, you've had so long.
[4505.56 --> 4508.30]  Like, at this rate, you're going to take longer to beat it than I did.
[4508.34 --> 4509.54]  And I took, like, ten years.
[4509.54 --> 4513.00]  Because I first got it when I was, like, six.
[4513.60 --> 4516.06]  I have free use of the airship now.
[4516.06 --> 4517.22]  No, I was older than that.
[4518.34 --> 4524.84]  And we just went through the long series of effectively cinematics.
[4525.00 --> 4528.60]  They're not technically, but effectively cinematics of you talking to them.
[4528.64 --> 4529.62]  Man, what are they called again?
[4529.74 --> 4529.98]  Espers?
[4530.28 --> 4531.92]  You see the esper-like realm.
[4532.62 --> 4535.22]  And you make a baby.
[4535.54 --> 4536.42]  Oh, yeah, you do.
[4536.62 --> 4538.56]  And you, like, go through all those steps.
[4538.56 --> 4540.22]  And then I have free use of the airship.
[4540.38 --> 4543.34]  And right now, I'm trying not to, like, you know, just Google everything.
[4543.62 --> 4545.60]  So, they're like, yeah, go to that place.
[4545.76 --> 4547.40]  And I'm like, where is that?
[4547.40 --> 4548.20]  Hey, you got the map.
[4548.28 --> 4549.08]  I gave you the map.
[4549.16 --> 4549.50]  I do.
[4549.76 --> 4552.46]  He's got the paper map from my physical copy of the game.
[4552.46 --> 4554.88]  So, I think based on that, I figured out where it was.
[4555.26 --> 4555.90]  Flew over there.
[4556.26 --> 4556.92]  Landed the ship.
[4557.40 --> 4558.48]  And then logged off for there.
[4558.50 --> 4558.94]  Yeah, okay.
[4559.06 --> 4559.82]  So, that's where I'm at.
[4560.36 --> 4563.66]  So, I haven't actually entered the place to figure out if I actually did find it or not.
[4563.92 --> 4565.16]  But I don't know.
[4565.46 --> 4565.98]  Educated guess.
[4565.98 --> 4567.42]  Okay, so, who's your mains?
[4568.56 --> 4571.92]  What is his name?
[4572.48 --> 4576.06]  Okay, so, the traitor chick that has Rudic power.
[4576.06 --> 4576.16]  I'll fight you.
[4576.76 --> 4578.02]  I'm not going to even remember anything.
[4578.04 --> 4578.46]  No, I'm kidding.
[4578.56 --> 4579.04]  Solz is great.
[4579.20 --> 4579.64]  Okay, yeah.
[4579.78 --> 4580.44]  She's one of them.
[4581.26 --> 4583.60]  The guy that has the, what is it, Blitz moves?
[4584.14 --> 4584.36]  Yeah.
[4584.72 --> 4584.96]  Sabin.
[4585.12 --> 4586.26]  He's my favorite one so far.
[4586.26 --> 4591.16]  I really like the, whatever the one is that sends a bunch of him across the screen when
[4591.16 --> 4591.58]  they're on fire.
[4592.38 --> 4593.24]  Oh, fire dance.
[4593.54 --> 4593.76]  Yeah.
[4593.90 --> 4594.06]  Yeah.
[4594.30 --> 4594.84]  That one's great.
[4594.96 --> 4596.44]  I don't think it's actually called that in this version.
[4596.44 --> 4596.84]  No, it's not.
[4597.04 --> 4599.90]  I'm like, some of the characters' names are even different.
[4600.02 --> 4603.64]  So, I'm going original SNES Final Fantasy 3.
[4603.64 --> 4604.42]  Three, yeah.
[4604.42 --> 4607.12]  And he's talking Final Fantasy 6, yeah.
[4607.36 --> 4607.54]  Yeah.
[4608.20 --> 4611.42]  And then the other one is, he uses tools.
[4611.94 --> 4613.10]  And he has auto crossbow.
[4613.20 --> 4613.54]  Yeah, Edgar.
[4613.82 --> 4614.06]  Yeah.
[4614.22 --> 4615.48]  So, those are the four I tend to run.
[4615.74 --> 4616.32]  That was four?
[4617.06 --> 4618.66]  Well, and then, wait.
[4619.34 --> 4620.36]  I think that was three.
[4621.20 --> 4621.88]  That was three.
[4622.14 --> 4624.80]  So, then who's my fellas?
[4625.32 --> 4625.68]  That one?
[4626.12 --> 4627.22]  Oh, and the thief guy.
[4627.30 --> 4628.48]  But he, like, sucks.
[4629.26 --> 4630.52]  Well, why do you main him then?
[4630.64 --> 4631.44]  I don't main him.
[4631.44 --> 4634.24]  He's been with me for a while now because of how the story's been going.
[4634.24 --> 4634.62]  I see.
[4634.72 --> 4634.90]  Okay.
[4635.06 --> 4635.38]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4635.50 --> 4635.80]  Okay.
[4636.76 --> 4638.58]  Don't tell him, you guys.
[4638.64 --> 4639.18]  Don't tell him.
[4640.86 --> 4642.60]  Oh, I'm assuming he, like, gets good or something.
[4643.04 --> 4646.70]  I try to steal all the time.
[4647.42 --> 4648.56]  It never does anything.
[4648.56 --> 4650.38]  But I'm like, I want to try.
[4650.56 --> 4656.06]  So, I try at least one version of, like, every mob that I fight, I will try to steal from.
[4656.38 --> 4658.88]  I think it's worked once the whole game.
[4658.96 --> 4661.42]  Dude, stealing from mobs is a complete waste of time.
[4662.24 --> 4663.02]  Don't even bother.
[4663.12 --> 4664.14]  They never have anything good.
[4664.56 --> 4665.34]  They never have anything?
[4666.14 --> 4667.04]  Yeah, that too.
[4667.62 --> 4668.70]  I'm like, why?
[4668.80 --> 4670.12]  Why can you even do it?
[4670.14 --> 4672.92]  There's the occasional one that's good, like the fossil fangs.
[4673.04 --> 4676.72]  You can steal, I think it's like elixirs or something from them.
[4676.72 --> 4677.04]  Okay.
[4677.50 --> 4681.44]  As long as you can get it before they, like, zombie your whole party and you just die.
[4681.84 --> 4685.10]  There's, like, there's stuff that's good to steal from, but for the most part, it's a waste of time.
[4685.10 --> 4687.32]  I just, I'm trying to be very thorough.
[4688.76 --> 4697.06]  So, like, I think I told you in that one town near the beginning of the game, I was trying to figure out, like, you know, you bring the guy alcohol and then he lets you do whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4697.26 --> 4699.30]  And it turns out I was doing it, like, too early.
[4699.38 --> 4701.06]  You're supposed to do it the next time you come back or whatever.
[4701.20 --> 4702.54]  So, I'm like, I'm trying to be very thorough.
[4702.62 --> 4703.48]  I'm talking to everybody.
[4703.54 --> 4703.70]  Yeah.
[4703.70 --> 4704.48]  I'm doing everything.
[4704.64 --> 4707.26]  So, I don't want to miss something because I didn't try to steal.
[4708.54 --> 4710.44]  So, I'm just every combat.
[4710.86 --> 4711.28]  All right.
[4711.46 --> 4712.20]  Almost, you know.
[4712.32 --> 4714.36]  When I run into a repeat, I don't do it again.
[4714.48 --> 4714.68]  Yeah.
[4714.72 --> 4714.98]  Okay.
[4715.06 --> 4715.34]  Okay.
[4716.10 --> 4716.42]  Nice.
[4716.54 --> 4716.76]  All right.
[4716.80 --> 4717.98]  Well, glad you're enjoying it.
[4718.04 --> 4720.62]  It is truly one of my favorite games of all time.
[4721.02 --> 4721.12]  Yeah.
[4721.18 --> 4721.94]  It's been good.
[4723.12 --> 4724.70]  You've played Chrono Trigger, right?
[4725.20 --> 4725.52]  No.
[4725.60 --> 4726.24]  Oh, my God.
[4727.60 --> 4730.24]  You know, I had a really good...
[4730.24 --> 4737.30]  I had a really good chat with Carl Jacobs at Creator Summit.
[4737.82 --> 4737.96]  Yeah.
[4738.12 --> 4740.60]  He is an appreciator of quality games.
[4740.82 --> 4741.50]  I don't know.
[4741.60 --> 4744.00]  I think I would trust him for game recommendations over you.
[4744.18 --> 4744.58]  I'm sorry.
[4745.12 --> 4747.30]  But you're not familiar enough with the classics.
[4748.50 --> 4749.74]  Did you like Titanfall?
[4750.48 --> 4751.28]  Yes, I did.
[4751.44 --> 4751.70]  Two.
[4751.94 --> 4752.52]  Titanfall 2.
[4752.52 --> 4754.34]  He made me play the single-player campaign.
[4754.56 --> 4755.12]  All right.
[4756.38 --> 4756.78]  Yeah.
[4756.92 --> 4758.00]  What was the question?
[4759.30 --> 4759.70]  Oh, yeah.
[4759.80 --> 4760.10]  Okay.
[4760.24 --> 4760.40]  Okay.
[4760.50 --> 4761.44]  Dan, carry on.
[4763.82 --> 4764.86]  Star Wars.
[4765.16 --> 4766.58]  How like Star Wars.
[4766.64 --> 4767.28]  Yeah, we figured it out.
[4767.28 --> 4767.80]  Hello, LLD.
[4767.98 --> 4771.70]  Will there be, at any point, an LTT belt for the cargo pants?
[4777.16 --> 4779.16]  Is this an actual product from us?
[4782.14 --> 4782.50]  Oh!
[4782.86 --> 4783.18]  Oh!
[4786.14 --> 4787.38]  That was perfectly timed.
[4787.48 --> 4788.06]  I don't know how we did that.
[4788.06 --> 4788.94]  I want one so bad.
[4789.04 --> 4789.72]  The answer is no.
[4789.72 --> 4790.52]  Oh!
[4790.92 --> 4791.22]  Oh.
[4791.76 --> 4799.52]  We have not been able to find a supplier that meets my standards for, like...
[4799.52 --> 4800.36]  I was excited.
[4800.56 --> 4802.12]  Cracking and...
[4802.12 --> 4805.10]  And or delamination.
[4805.70 --> 4806.42]  Ooh, yeah.
[4806.42 --> 4807.08]  Yeah.
[4807.08 --> 4810.54]  Part of this might just be the nature of leather goods.
[4810.54 --> 4811.54]  Yeah.
[4811.54 --> 4812.54]  But I...
[4812.54 --> 4813.30]  I...
[4813.30 --> 4813.96]  It's just...
[4813.96 --> 4814.58]  It's this, like...
[4814.58 --> 4820.16]  It's this, like, top plasticky layer that basically everyone and their dog wants to put
[4820.16 --> 4820.64]  on them.
[4820.64 --> 4827.20]  And I think we ended up trying, like, between four and six different suppliers, just looking
[4827.20 --> 4833.16]  for someone who could give me something that was just a big old big piece of...
[4833.16 --> 4834.90]  God, you know?
[4834.90 --> 4835.70]  Like, just...
[4835.70 --> 4836.74]  Just that.
[4836.94 --> 4837.70]  Nothing else.
[4838.24 --> 4840.68]  And nobody could do it.
[4841.00 --> 4841.64]  And, yeah.
[4841.76 --> 4844.54]  Because, like, if you look at it, it's just, like...
[4844.54 --> 4845.16]  It's a mess.
[4845.24 --> 4845.56]  Oh, yeah.
[4845.60 --> 4845.74]  I know.
[4845.74 --> 4846.12]  I can tell.
[4846.18 --> 4847.66]  And this is the kind of thing that I just...
[4847.66 --> 4848.52]  I wouldn't be...
[4848.52 --> 4849.96]  I wouldn't be comfortable selling.
[4850.34 --> 4850.78]  So...
[4850.78 --> 4853.78]  The one from the island that made us these is probably screaming right now.
[4854.92 --> 4855.32]  Yeah.
[4855.38 --> 4860.20]  I mean, I'm sure if we wanted to, like, you know, artisan, you know, make...
[4860.20 --> 4861.04]  Way too expensive per belt.
[4861.04 --> 4862.20]  Make 23 belts.
[4862.68 --> 4862.92]  Yeah.
[4863.10 --> 4864.52]  Sell 23 belts a year or whatever.
[4864.64 --> 4865.88]  Like, I'm sure we could figure it out.
[4867.74 --> 4868.14]  But...
[4868.14 --> 4869.46]  No.
[4869.62 --> 4871.90]  You just need to get natural leather, not finished leather.
[4872.88 --> 4873.40]  Well...
[4873.40 --> 4874.10]  Make them out of metal.
[4874.44 --> 4875.28]  Like a watch band.
[4875.44 --> 4877.04]  Maybe we'll figure it out another time.
[4877.22 --> 4880.76]  But the other thing is, like, back to our conversation earlier about how one of the
[4880.76 --> 4884.52]  the things that we look for in any category is, you know, what are we adding to the conversation?
[4884.66 --> 4889.82]  I couldn't figure out what we were adding to the conversation if, like, strap-o leather
[4889.82 --> 4890.90]  already exists.
[4891.50 --> 4894.86]  Like, my old Kirkland belt lasted a really long time.
[4895.56 --> 4897.64]  Do I really want to go toe-to-toe with Costco?
[4898.40 --> 4899.16]  Maybe not.
[4900.68 --> 4901.54]  What about shirts?
[4902.36 --> 4902.72]  Shirts?
[4903.00 --> 4903.20]  Yeah.
[4903.46 --> 4904.22]  Our shirts are great.
[4904.74 --> 4904.98]  Yeah.
[4905.26 --> 4905.48]  Yeah.
[4907.16 --> 4908.06]  Make a great belt?
[4908.48 --> 4908.70]  Oh.
[4908.70 --> 4909.76]  Well, yeah.
[4910.76 --> 4914.30]  Well, we haven't found the right, great supplier yet.
[4914.42 --> 4914.96]  I'm just saying.
[4915.06 --> 4917.32]  That doesn't mean you can just never do belts.
[4917.80 --> 4918.30]  You're right.
[4918.38 --> 4918.64]  You're right.
[4918.74 --> 4922.24]  And if we succeed at pants for the first time ever...
[4922.24 --> 4923.30]  Maybe there's...
[4923.30 --> 4925.12]  Then maybe we will look at belts.
[4925.30 --> 4925.54]  Sure.
[4925.76 --> 4926.50]  That's reasonable.
[4926.72 --> 4927.34]  That's very reasonable.
[4927.40 --> 4931.18]  So far, cargo pants are looking like they are going to be a success.
[4932.54 --> 4935.10]  And if that happens, then, yeah, we want to...
[4935.10 --> 4936.20]  We want to do more inseams.
[4936.34 --> 4937.58]  We want to do...
[4937.58 --> 4937.76]  Sure.
[4937.86 --> 4938.00]  Yeah.
[4938.00 --> 4939.00]  We want to do more inseams.
[4939.00 --> 4939.20]  Yeah.
[4939.26 --> 4940.80]  No, I know they're a little short on you.
[4940.94 --> 4941.10]  Yep.
[4941.38 --> 4941.60]  Yep.
[4941.76 --> 4942.24]  Duly noted.
[4942.42 --> 4942.96]  I get it.
[4943.74 --> 4949.54]  The good news is we've so far sold through probably about a fifth of our inventory.
[4950.40 --> 4951.00]  So...
[4951.00 --> 4951.30]  Nice.
[4951.48 --> 4951.66]  Yeah.
[4951.78 --> 4955.18]  We might move through them all, in which case, yeah, we might be able to restock some other sizes.
[4955.46 --> 4955.70]  Cool.
[4956.92 --> 4957.34]  All right.
[4957.60 --> 4959.38]  How about one more?
[4959.48 --> 4959.98]  What do we got here?
[4959.98 --> 4960.00]  Sure.
[4960.00 --> 4960.50]  Hit me, Dan.
[4960.50 --> 4968.08]  Hey, DLL, I wanted to order a DualSense 30th anniversary controller this week, but they sold out, apparently mostly to scalpers.
[4968.36 --> 4972.92]  What can companies like Sony do to combat this relatively shitty behavior?
[4973.04 --> 4973.60]  Hey, Dan.
[4973.76 --> 4974.16]  I'm sorry.
[4974.24 --> 4975.64]  I just read what was on the prompter.
[4975.72 --> 4976.34]  That was my fault.
[4979.14 --> 4979.58]  Whoops.
[4982.70 --> 4983.18]  Jesus.
[4983.18 --> 4986.04]  Is it really just gray?
[4990.12 --> 4990.90]  What's just gray?
[4991.10 --> 4991.80]  What if you just got skins that made it gray?
[4991.80 --> 4993.78]  No, no, it comes with a cool cable.
[4993.90 --> 4994.30]  Dang it!
[4994.50 --> 4994.70]  Oh.
[4995.92 --> 4996.60]  Scroll down.
[4996.68 --> 4997.98]  See if they have a picture of the cable.
[5001.40 --> 5002.66]  Where's the cool charging cable?
[5002.74 --> 5004.26]  I thought it comes with a cool charging cable.
[5004.92 --> 5006.98]  There's a whole conversation internally about this.
[5009.98 --> 5012.64]  I thought it comes with a cool USB-C cable.
[5013.18 --> 5014.00]  Oh, wait.
[5014.06 --> 5014.82]  Cable not included.
[5015.40 --> 5015.78]  Seriously?
[5016.64 --> 5018.20]  Okay, well, what happened to the cool cable?
[5018.20 --> 5020.82]  Just go get a gray skin for your controller.
[5022.96 --> 5023.82]  I mean, yeah.
[5024.00 --> 5024.40]  Sorry.
[5025.80 --> 5026.92]  It's PS1 gray?
[5027.12 --> 5032.14]  I'm sure somebody sells PS1 gray skins.
[5033.98 --> 5034.34]  Probably.
[5034.82 --> 5035.66]  I don't know, dude.
[5035.82 --> 5037.82]  I, um...
[5037.82 --> 5040.24]  This is one of those things where, and you know what?
[5040.36 --> 5040.58]  Yeah.
[5040.78 --> 5042.12]  The behavior, like, sucks.
[5042.12 --> 5045.48]  People who actually want it should be the ones who have it.
[5045.98 --> 5047.12]  But also...
[5047.12 --> 5048.56]  It is very difficult to stop.
[5048.94 --> 5049.30]  Yeah.
[5049.44 --> 5052.58]  I mean, we tried, and I actually think we did a really great job.
[5052.76 --> 5053.14]  We did pretty all right.
[5053.28 --> 5054.38]  But it wasn't perfect.
[5054.66 --> 5058.68]  And, you know, for example, one of the things that was pointed out about the verified actual
[5058.68 --> 5064.86]  gamer program where we had people, like, play a game, essentially, as, like, the ultimate
[5064.86 --> 5069.16]  reCAPTCHA to prove that you were not only a human, but a gamer.
[5069.42 --> 5073.60]  One of the things that was pointed out to us after the first few of them was it's not
[5073.60 --> 5074.44]  really accessible.
[5074.98 --> 5079.68]  You know, someone could be a gamer, but, like, not be able to interface...
[5079.68 --> 5080.54]  Play that type of game.
[5080.54 --> 5080.72]  Yeah.
[5080.82 --> 5082.54]  Interface with their computer that way.
[5082.64 --> 5084.16]  And we were like, okay, shoot.
[5084.34 --> 5094.26]  I'm like, what do you do to be accessible enough for every person, but also not easily defeated
[5094.26 --> 5096.76]  by a program, right?
[5096.80 --> 5098.80]  It's really, really challenging.
[5098.80 --> 5101.86]  And I guess it kind of is what it is.
[5101.96 --> 5106.22]  And the good news is that it is a 30th anniversary controller.
[5106.56 --> 5107.90]  It is not water.
[5109.24 --> 5110.26]  Yeah, you'll be all right.
[5110.90 --> 5111.90]  Yeah, it's...
[5111.90 --> 5113.62]  I understand people are educating me.
[5113.70 --> 5118.34]  Apparently, the buttons are colored, and they're not always colored.
[5119.62 --> 5121.98]  Sometimes their gray controller looks like that.
[5123.46 --> 5126.50]  And now it looks like that because the buttons are colored.
[5126.50 --> 5127.16]  But, uh...
[5127.16 --> 5129.84]  Guys, you're not going to convince Luke with that argument.
[5129.92 --> 5131.18]  Look at the look on his face.
[5131.26 --> 5131.30]  I think you'll be all right.
[5131.30 --> 5132.22]  I think you'll be okay.
[5135.96 --> 5136.28]  Yeah.
[5136.90 --> 5137.66]  I just...
[5137.66 --> 5138.74]  I don't know, man.
[5139.88 --> 5142.26]  Oh, I was expecting it to be, like, wicked.
[5142.38 --> 5145.74]  And then when you were like, oh, it's the cable, I was like, okay, this is going to be sick.
[5145.82 --> 5147.32]  And then...
[5147.32 --> 5149.28]  It's gray.
[5150.48 --> 5151.64]  The cable's pretty cool.
[5151.80 --> 5153.50]  Here, let me see if I can find this.
[5154.42 --> 5154.56]  Here.
[5155.34 --> 5156.08]  Luke is not nostalgic?
[5156.08 --> 5156.86]  No, I am.
[5156.92 --> 5157.58]  It's just...
[5157.58 --> 5159.16]  Okay, that is pretty cool.
[5159.22 --> 5161.24]  Yeah, so it's a USB-C cable with the thing.
[5161.24 --> 5162.38]  I like that a lot more than the controller itself.
[5162.38 --> 5164.26]  So, yeah, it comes with the console.
[5165.20 --> 5166.68]  That, yeah, that actually looks pretty legit.
[5166.80 --> 5167.26]  I like that.
[5169.94 --> 5171.14]  But this is...
[5171.14 --> 5172.10]  This is a toy.
[5173.28 --> 5173.80]  You know?
[5174.22 --> 5177.36]  It's an expensive toy for adults, but it's a toy.
[5177.98 --> 5179.10]  And I...
[5179.10 --> 5180.96]  It's not even a toy that provides access.
[5180.96 --> 5183.22]  Because you can just have any other controller.
[5183.56 --> 5187.90]  Like, it's not like, you know, when PS5s themselves were being scalped and no one could get a PS5.
[5188.26 --> 5188.48]  Yeah.
[5188.70 --> 5191.32]  Like, to be clear, I like cool controllers.
[5191.62 --> 5192.04]  Yeah, me too.
[5192.38 --> 5193.38]  I really do.
[5193.48 --> 5193.98]  Like, I...
[5193.98 --> 5200.64]  My favorite of my Xbox controllers, of which I own probably somewhere between a dozen and 15...
[5200.64 --> 5200.88]  Yeah.
[5200.88 --> 5206.12]  Is the one that went out to the people who developed the console.
[5206.36 --> 5206.50]  Yeah.
[5206.50 --> 5207.54]  A handful of them flipped them.
[5208.18 --> 5209.48]  And, you know what?
[5209.54 --> 5212.36]  I paid way too much money for that controller.
[5213.30 --> 5217.88]  But realistically, it was a fraction of what I paid for my most expensive controller, so...
[5219.88 --> 5222.36]  That's a bit of an investment.
[5222.56 --> 5227.40]  Yeah, if anyone wants to buy a golden Xbox controller, by the way, the previous buyer flaked.
[5227.40 --> 5230.10]  So, you know, get in touch.
[5230.10 --> 5231.10]  He gold flaked?
[5231.34 --> 5232.82]  It's very much for sale.
[5234.54 --> 5236.82]  Didn't you want that Gears of War Xbox controller?
[5236.96 --> 5238.10]  Yeah, and I got it.
[5238.20 --> 5238.38]  Yeah.
[5238.68 --> 5240.54]  But just like, I don't know.
[5241.98 --> 5249.02]  But the Gears of War Xbox controller has like claw marks in the controller that go into the plastic.
[5249.78 --> 5252.02]  Yeah, they actually did a different mold for it at least.
[5252.08 --> 5252.16]  Yeah.
[5252.68 --> 5253.36]  So that's something.
[5254.80 --> 5255.56]  This is...
[5255.56 --> 5256.94]  It is a cool controller.
[5256.94 --> 5262.74]  It has the retro PlayStation logo with the colors on it and stuff like that that they should have never ditched, etc.
[5263.08 --> 5264.22]  But it's also...
[5264.22 --> 5265.64]  It's just a great controller.
[5265.92 --> 5266.20]  Okay.
[5266.54 --> 5266.94]  I mean...
[5267.98 --> 5268.76]  Oh, okay.
[5268.84 --> 5269.64]  So confirm pre-order.
[5269.76 --> 5274.82]  So you have to pay $150 on top of the like $80 it is for the controller or whatever.
[5275.76 --> 5276.68]  On top of?
[5276.86 --> 5277.90]  Yeah, I would assume so.
[5278.62 --> 5279.04]  Really?
[5280.60 --> 5281.62]  Confirmed order.
[5281.78 --> 5281.88]  Yeah.
[5281.88 --> 5283.14]  Are you buying an order?
[5283.14 --> 5283.98]  I think you're buying...
[5283.98 --> 5285.28]  Or are you buying the controller?
[5287.34 --> 5290.96]  Oh, apparently that Gears of War was laser etched.
[5291.44 --> 5291.80]  So, okay.
[5291.88 --> 5292.12]  Okay.
[5292.28 --> 5292.78]  Either way.
[5292.90 --> 5293.56]  Like, they're doing...
[5293.56 --> 5294.08]  It was different.
[5294.18 --> 5294.62]  It was cool.
[5295.24 --> 5297.00]  Is this just like nostalgia baiting?
[5297.36 --> 5297.56]  Yeah.
[5297.64 --> 5298.10]  Oh, it's...
[5298.10 --> 5299.84]  Dude, it's 100% nostalgia baiting.
[5299.90 --> 5300.06]  Yeah.
[5300.64 --> 5301.84]  A hundred percent.
[5302.36 --> 5302.98]  So you got...
[5302.98 --> 5303.48]  And it's sick.
[5303.52 --> 5306.02]  If you were going to buy a controller anyways, this is a cool controller to buy.
[5306.02 --> 5309.20]  But if you pay a bunch of money, you're getting nostalgia baited.
[5309.48 --> 5309.76]  Yeah.
[5311.32 --> 5312.06]  Nostalgia baited?
[5312.14 --> 5312.70]  I got it.
[5313.12 --> 5313.88]  It's pretty good.
[5313.96 --> 5314.12]  Yeah.
[5314.76 --> 5315.64]  It's pretty good.
[5315.68 --> 5316.42]  I was reaching for it.
[5316.48 --> 5316.96]  It was pretty good.
[5316.96 --> 5317.48]  I was reaching for it a little bit.
[5317.80 --> 5318.34]  All right.
[5318.50 --> 5319.94]  We've got a couple more topics here.
[5320.02 --> 5321.86]  Why don't we talk about...
[5321.86 --> 5324.62]  The Concord controller is cooler than the game was.
[5325.22 --> 5326.00]  That looks pretty neat.
[5328.54 --> 5330.04]  Kind of funny that they're selling these.
[5330.14 --> 5330.70]  Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[5330.70 --> 5337.12]  Why don't we talk about our friend in the industry?
[5338.20 --> 5338.78]  Ah, yes.
[5339.04 --> 5340.90]  The big controversy this week.
[5341.58 --> 5342.90]  The one, the only.
[5344.12 --> 5350.00]  MKBHD released a wallpaper app for your phone.
[5350.40 --> 5350.60]  Okay?
[5350.72 --> 5351.72]  iOS and Android.
[5353.40 --> 5360.58]  And a significant portion of the community was quite, let's say...
[5360.70 --> 5361.24]  Put out.
[5362.20 --> 5362.60]  Yeah.
[5364.22 --> 5365.76]  About this situation.
[5365.86 --> 5367.06]  Their rabbles were roused.
[5367.06 --> 5375.66]  This is one of those things where, you know, honestly speaking, guys, I'm not going to comment on the business decisions of a fellow creator.
[5376.20 --> 5386.26]  But what I will say is it was very clear that the community was not happy about the option for a $50 a year premium subscription
[5386.26 --> 5388.26]  that effectively paywall.
[5388.26 --> 5399.08]  That effectively paywalled the maximum quality of these wallpapers for people who were not interested in that.
[5399.40 --> 5406.72]  There was also some upset around some of the requested permissions of the particular app.
[5406.72 --> 5413.66]  There was some commentary and some observations around the quality of the app.
[5413.96 --> 5414.02]  Yeah.
[5414.02 --> 5416.86]  I believe that it turned out...
[5416.86 --> 5421.54]  Is it true that it was functionally just linking to a shared Google Drive repo?
[5421.54 --> 5426.76]  It was a Firebase download server, but there was no authentication on it.
[5427.06 --> 5428.36]  So anyone could just download it.
[5428.44 --> 5432.02]  And people set up bots to scrape it because they were talking about how they were going to do like...
[5432.02 --> 5435.66]  You know, I don't remember exactly the details, so I'm sorry, but like some type of...
[5435.66 --> 5441.48]  Part of the idea of the subscription is that they were going to drop new like artist packs and things like that.
[5441.52 --> 5443.42]  So you could get new wallpapers all the time.
[5443.42 --> 5451.46]  So people set up bots that were scraping it, which because they never signed any type of agreement or anything.
[5451.86 --> 5452.78]  It's technically...
[5452.78 --> 5454.68]  They didn't technically even bypass anything.
[5454.98 --> 5456.18]  It's technically legal then.
[5456.30 --> 5456.50]  Yeah.
[5456.50 --> 5463.16]  There was also some upset about the revenue share, which from my understanding was 50-50.
[5464.18 --> 5477.38]  And then even going into the hours leading up to this show, there has been some upset that Marquez himself didn't really properly address the community's concerns on the latest Waveform podcast.
[5478.04 --> 5480.38]  So that's kind of the summary that...
[5480.38 --> 5487.02]  That I think that's probably the best summary I can give you guys of why people are upset.
[5487.56 --> 5491.86]  I'll give sort of a short devil's advocate argument here.
[5492.16 --> 5493.60]  At least they're not NFTs.
[5494.40 --> 5494.64]  Yeah.
[5494.88 --> 5495.24]  Yeah.
[5495.30 --> 5500.70]  Honestly, they did give you just a straight up download of the...
[5500.70 --> 5506.20]  I think the word scam is one that gets overused a lot these days.
[5506.72 --> 5510.76]  I saw a lot of people describe the wallpaper app as a scam.
[5511.80 --> 5512.94]  What it is...
[5512.94 --> 5513.38]  Not a scam.
[5513.38 --> 5518.96]  What it is is, for a lot of people, probably not a great value.
[5519.70 --> 5521.86]  What it isn't is a scam.
[5522.02 --> 5525.72]  It communicates pretty clearly what you're going to get and what it costs.
[5525.72 --> 5526.64]  And what you're going to give up.
[5526.82 --> 5527.04]  Yeah.
[5527.04 --> 5532.08]  And if that's a value proposition that is acceptable to you...
[5532.08 --> 5532.68]  Then it's not a scam.
[5532.72 --> 5534.64]  Then you are more than welcome to pay it.
[5534.94 --> 5539.16]  And if that is not a value proposition, then you are more than welcome to not pay it.
[5539.62 --> 5541.56]  That is not a scam.
[5541.78 --> 5546.22]  A scam is representing something as something that it isn't.
[5546.22 --> 5552.18]  A scam would be if I said, go to LTT store right now.
[5552.70 --> 5560.16]  And every order comes with a free, this secret skin that I have on the back of my phone.
[5561.30 --> 5562.14]  And then it just...
[5562.14 --> 5562.76]  I'm still wondering about.
[5562.84 --> 5564.12]  And then it just didn't arrive.
[5564.60 --> 5564.76]  Yeah.
[5564.78 --> 5565.78]  That would be a scam.
[5566.24 --> 5566.50]  Yeah.
[5567.04 --> 5568.38]  It isn't a scam.
[5569.68 --> 5576.00]  Hobblestoff says, but Linus, is there a line where something is bad enough value that it becomes a scam?
[5576.72 --> 5577.14]  No.
[5577.76 --> 5580.46]  That is not what scam means.
[5581.04 --> 5582.94]  Scam means that you have been deceived.
[5583.38 --> 5584.70]  You have not been deceived.
[5585.18 --> 5587.34]  You are getting image files.
[5587.84 --> 5591.56]  You are sending money and permissions on your phone.
[5592.20 --> 5593.82]  Those things are all disclosed.
[5594.40 --> 5596.24]  Therefore, it is not a scam.
[5597.00 --> 5598.08]  It's not your thing.
[5598.26 --> 5599.62]  It's not your bag, baby.
[5601.10 --> 5602.52]  But it isn't a scam.
[5603.32 --> 5604.70]  Does that kind of make sense?
[5604.70 --> 5605.06]  No.
[5605.26 --> 5605.70]  No.
[5605.82 --> 5609.58]  Some people don't seem to understand this.
[5614.08 --> 5619.26]  I looked up scam.
[5619.26 --> 5619.28]  Okay.
[5619.34 --> 5619.72]  So Vinan...
[5619.72 --> 5623.06]  Is it a fraudulent or deceptive act or operation?
[5623.52 --> 5627.48]  Vinan says, by the same argument, $1,000 HDMI cables are not a scam.
[5627.78 --> 5629.58]  Well, they can or they can't be.
[5629.58 --> 5637.26]  If they claim to give you better audio quality or better video quality, then they are a scam because they don't do that.
[5637.92 --> 5651.04]  If they are just expensive and they literally just say, there are $1,000 HDMI cables that make you feel a warm feeling inside for being able to afford them when other people can't, then that's not a scam.
[5651.04 --> 5653.04]  I am...
[5653.04 --> 5653.72]  I...
[5653.72 --> 5654.04]  I...
[5654.04 --> 5655.04]  This shouldn't...
[5655.04 --> 5659.08]  This really shouldn't surprise me that much given how many people...
[5659.08 --> 5663.44]  I mean, I started this segment with a lot of people seem to misuse the word scam.
[5663.44 --> 5669.14]  So I really shouldn't be that confused that a lot of people don't know what it means.
[5669.28 --> 5669.44]  But that...
[5670.56 --> 5673.10]  That's not what scam means.
[5674.06 --> 5675.14]  Scam is fraud.
[5675.36 --> 5676.48]  Scam is lying.
[5677.20 --> 5677.96]  Nobody lied.
[5678.14 --> 5679.36]  Nobody scammed anybody.
[5680.24 --> 5684.72]  Nobody's money was removed forcefully against their will.
[5685.34 --> 5686.94]  So it's not a scam.
[5686.94 --> 5694.08]  Would I charge a $50 subscription for wallpaper images?
[5695.22 --> 5696.80]  I was about to say yes.
[5697.16 --> 5697.64]  You know what?
[5698.22 --> 5698.78]  Sure.
[5699.40 --> 5700.76]  Let's do it.
[5701.34 --> 5701.98]  New.
[5702.88 --> 5704.24]  Announcing now.
[5704.36 --> 5705.48]  Here on the WAN show.
[5705.64 --> 5708.74]  Now available at Flowplane.com.
[5712.32 --> 5715.86]  Is the LTT Wallpaper Pack.
[5715.86 --> 5717.96]  I'm going to...
[5717.96 --> 5719.24]  Can I show the CMS?
[5719.56 --> 5720.16]  Is that okay?
[5720.30 --> 5721.04]  Can I show the CMS?
[5721.28 --> 5721.68]  That's fine.
[5721.86 --> 5723.20]  I think I just...
[5723.20 --> 5724.08]  I'm going to show the CMS.
[5724.82 --> 5725.76]  It'll be fine.
[5726.04 --> 5726.90]  It'll be fine.
[5726.96 --> 5727.44]  You'll like it.
[5727.52 --> 5727.78]  Okay.
[5728.10 --> 5729.04]  I'm showing the CMS.
[5729.60 --> 5730.44]  Right now.
[5730.76 --> 5733.16]  Going live for LTT...
[5733.16 --> 5738.26]  Sorry, LTT Supporter OG and LTT Supporter and Just Text Posts.
[5738.70 --> 5744.60]  Going live only for LTT Supporter Plus, which is available for $10 a month or $50 a year.
[5744.60 --> 5747.36]  You said earlier in the show that you're going to do the $5 one.
[5747.58 --> 5748.06]  No, I didn't.
[5748.56 --> 5749.08]  I think you did.
[5749.26 --> 5749.60]  Oh, wait.
[5749.94 --> 5750.22]  Oh, yeah.
[5750.28 --> 5750.40]  No, no.
[5750.44 --> 5751.06]  That's right.
[5751.44 --> 5751.80]  Scam!
[5751.96 --> 5752.24]  No, no.
[5752.26 --> 5753.02]  I did the math wrong.
[5753.06 --> 5753.78]  He almost scammed.
[5754.12 --> 5755.40]  I did the math wrong, but no.
[5755.44 --> 5756.80]  You got to do OG as well.
[5756.98 --> 5757.34]  No, I don't.
[5758.10 --> 5759.24]  Oh, but they're supposed to get everything.
[5760.24 --> 5762.64]  No, they only get everything that we originally promised them.
[5763.02 --> 5763.72]  This is new.
[5763.98 --> 5764.72]  This is net new.
[5764.88 --> 5765.40]  Scam radar.
[5765.80 --> 5767.44]  No, no, no, no.
[5768.02 --> 5768.38]  All right.
[5768.44 --> 5768.82]  Tell you what.
[5768.86 --> 5769.06]  Fine.
[5769.06 --> 5769.38]  Sure.
[5770.54 --> 5775.88]  You will get these wallpapers created.
[5776.72 --> 5779.46]  This actually looks like all Sarah's stuff.
[5779.94 --> 5781.50]  I believe this is all Sarah.
[5781.50 --> 5781.86]  Okay.
[5781.94 --> 5782.66]  There's also this.
[5782.78 --> 5783.58]  They just kind of scrambled.
[5783.98 --> 5784.22]  Yeah.
[5784.30 --> 5786.30]  They just threw this together.
[5786.46 --> 5788.82]  They threw this together in the minutes before the show.
[5789.22 --> 5792.44]  You will be able to get all of these wallpapers.
[5792.44 --> 5798.88]  All you have to do is sign up for Floatplane at at least our $5 a month or $50 a year tier.
[5799.26 --> 5799.38]  Yeah.
[5799.50 --> 5800.06]  There you go.
[5800.28 --> 5800.48]  Yeah.
[5802.10 --> 5802.86]  Let's see.
[5803.04 --> 5803.60]  Let's see.
[5803.76 --> 5807.52]  Let's watch people turn this into Linus's scamming his audience.
[5807.72 --> 5808.86]  I'm excited for it.
[5808.88 --> 5809.24]  Oh, man.
[5809.28 --> 5810.80]  They did a dead pixel one.
[5810.90 --> 5811.44]  Yeah, dog.
[5812.20 --> 5815.42]  The dead pixel one could be used.
[5816.04 --> 5818.36]  LTT phone wallpapers for floaties.
[5818.48 --> 5819.38]  Let's go.
[5820.22 --> 5820.50]  Woo!
[5820.78 --> 5821.48]  Look at that.
[5821.48 --> 5822.76]  Wow, what a wallpaper.
[5823.42 --> 5824.18]  Yeah, dead pixel.
[5824.54 --> 5826.10]  That's on purpose.
[5826.50 --> 5827.72]  I was expecting these to be garbage.
[5827.90 --> 5828.76]  These are actually pretty cool.
[5828.82 --> 5829.72]  These are actually legit.
[5829.94 --> 5830.98]  What did you just say?
[5831.16 --> 5834.98]  What did you just say about the valued member of our team?
[5834.98 --> 5835.20]  No, no, no.
[5835.34 --> 5837.28]  I wasn't sure how hard you were going to meme.
[5837.42 --> 5840.22]  Like, you know, when we were doing those sales and it's 9 p.m.
[5840.22 --> 5844.20]  and Nick Light's only there and he goes like, he draws a stick figure, like more orange shirts.
[5844.50 --> 5845.22]  No, this is like.
[5845.22 --> 5845.54]  No, this is.
[5845.68 --> 5847.48]  I was surprised at how fast she turned all these around.
[5847.50 --> 5847.90]  These are great.
[5848.10 --> 5848.34]  Yeah.
[5848.34 --> 5854.50]  The one with the waves on it and the logo is what we use on the YouTube background as
[5854.50 --> 5854.70]  well.
[5854.84 --> 5855.90]  That one's pretty damn cool.
[5856.12 --> 5856.60]  We've got.
[5856.98 --> 5858.12]  Oh, hold on.
[5858.52 --> 5858.72]  Bye.
[5859.26 --> 5861.04]  Wait, which ones are the desktop ones?
[5861.10 --> 5861.70]  I thought there were.
[5861.82 --> 5862.08]  Oh, wait.
[5862.12 --> 5863.02]  No, they're only phones.
[5863.16 --> 5863.32]  Yeah.
[5864.72 --> 5865.80]  Here are some wallpapers.
[5865.90 --> 5867.74]  No reason why they're uploaded now.
[5867.74 --> 5872.20]  Thank you for that, Sammy.
[5874.42 --> 5874.74]  Okay.
[5874.78 --> 5875.20]  I thought we had.
[5875.32 --> 5877.50]  Oh, that makes sense that they would be phone ones that we got to.
[5877.58 --> 5878.24]  We got to compete.
[5878.34 --> 5881.42]  We got to compete head to head with our competitors in the industry.
[5881.42 --> 5885.78]  It's not like we're planning on this necessarily being like a thing that we do all the time.
[5885.86 --> 5886.52]  No, it's really not.
[5886.98 --> 5889.12]  We're just we're just having some fun with it.
[5889.12 --> 5896.26]  So do I think that this was the world's most brilliant tactical move?
[5897.30 --> 5901.00]  I can't say that based on the community feedback.
[5902.36 --> 5905.90]  It seems like it.
[5905.90 --> 5909.26]  Is it a scam?
[5909.66 --> 5909.92]  No.
[5910.10 --> 5910.46]  No.
[5910.82 --> 5913.84]  It is factually by definition not a scam.
[5914.16 --> 5914.56]  So like.
[5915.44 --> 5919.62]  Calling it a scam is just telling other people you don't understand what a scam is.
[5919.88 --> 5920.04]  Yeah.
[5920.78 --> 5921.84]  But I do think.
[5921.84 --> 5924.32]  Maybe, you know, maybe count itself lucky for that.
[5925.10 --> 5930.24]  But I do think that this is, you know, maybe something that needs to be addressed in order
[5930.24 --> 5933.38]  to sort of rebuild goodwill with the community.
[5933.38 --> 5939.28]  And so that's probably the that's probably the best advice, which I think they're doing.
[5940.10 --> 5941.24]  I'm sure they're working on it.
[5941.28 --> 5942.78]  I hope they're working on it.
[5942.84 --> 5944.34]  I hope they're I hope they're working on it.
[5944.44 --> 5944.56]  Funny.
[5944.78 --> 5946.68]  Funny Hats asks me, what about a ripoff?
[5947.92 --> 5950.78]  I think lots of things are a ripoff.
[5950.96 --> 5956.68]  I think that basically any designer label article of clothing is a ripoff.
[5956.78 --> 5961.66]  I was recently made aware that the T-shirt that the Zuck wears that just like gray T-shirt
[5961.66 --> 5963.28]  is like 400 US dollars.
[5963.38 --> 5963.84]  Of course.
[5963.84 --> 5963.88]  Of course.
[5964.80 --> 5967.26]  I personally consider that to be a ripoff.
[5967.64 --> 5968.66]  He doesn't.
[5969.68 --> 5970.38]  A ripoff.
[5970.66 --> 5972.44]  It absolutely could be.
[5972.70 --> 5974.28]  But a ripoff is subjective.
[5975.10 --> 5976.30]  Scam is not.
[5976.90 --> 5978.92]  That's where these two terms differ.
[5979.20 --> 5980.84]  It's definitely not a scam.
[5981.02 --> 5983.86]  If you think it's a ripoff, it's a ripoff.
[5985.34 --> 5986.06]  That's it.
[5986.14 --> 5987.36]  And we could discuss that.
[5987.60 --> 5988.00]  Right.
[5988.00 --> 5990.24]  But it isn't a scam.
[5990.62 --> 5991.10]  That's all.
[5992.70 --> 5994.98]  Do you have any idea how many LTT shirts you can get for $400?
[5995.82 --> 5996.46]  I do.
[5996.68 --> 5998.74]  Actually, you can get 20.
[6000.06 --> 6001.44]  Well, don't forget about the shipping.
[6001.52 --> 6002.70]  Maybe 15 plus shipping.
[6002.86 --> 6003.14]  Taxes.
[6003.26 --> 6004.06]  Depending on where you live.
[6004.20 --> 6004.36]  Okay.
[6004.44 --> 6004.66]  All right.
[6004.70 --> 6004.88]  All right.
[6004.92 --> 6005.26]  Taxes.
[6005.38 --> 6005.46]  Sure.
[6006.28 --> 6008.70]  Mind you, you have to pay taxes on the $400 shirt too.
[6008.74 --> 6010.10]  Actually, you got to pay shipping on that too.
[6010.54 --> 6011.64]  Actually, I think we're doing pretty good.
[6011.64 --> 6011.96]  Hey.
[6011.96 --> 6012.32]  Yeah.
[6016.40 --> 6016.94]  Luke's birds.
[6017.44 --> 6019.68]  Unfortunately, this is my last week on Floatplane.
[6020.12 --> 6020.98]  Oh, no.
[6021.18 --> 6023.84]  You won't get our second pack of wallpapers.
[6024.40 --> 6024.90]  Just kidding.
[6024.98 --> 6026.60]  I don't think we're going to do another one.
[6026.66 --> 6027.28]  Probably not.
[6027.46 --> 6028.68]  I asked Sarah to just kind of.
[6028.74 --> 6029.34]  Oh, no.
[6029.60 --> 6032.24]  Linus, your face is now my MacBook screen.
[6032.42 --> 6032.72]  Yeah.
[6032.96 --> 6033.38]  Okay.
[6033.80 --> 6034.56]  That's great.
[6035.48 --> 6038.62]  Guess who just resubbed to Floatplane just for wallpapers?
[6038.80 --> 6039.52]  This guy.
[6041.96 --> 6042.78]  The system works.
[6042.88 --> 6044.00]  That wasn't the point.
[6044.92 --> 6046.14]  You knew what you were doing.
[6046.38 --> 6046.76]  In turn.
[6046.88 --> 6051.94]  I was mostly just memeing for the people who are already subscribed to Floatplane, Dan.
[6053.06 --> 6056.04]  They're just PNGs or JPEGs or whatever they are.
[6056.14 --> 6056.58]  There's no.
[6057.04 --> 6058.16]  Screen cap the screen.
[6058.52 --> 6058.70]  Yeah.
[6058.82 --> 6059.08]  People.
[6061.00 --> 6061.44]  Yeah.
[6061.58 --> 6062.58]  Right click the YouTube.
[6062.58 --> 6064.62]  If you want to steal it, just there.
[6064.74 --> 6064.98]  Quick.
[6065.48 --> 6066.26]  Press print screen.
[6066.36 --> 6066.94]  You got this.
[6067.50 --> 6069.04]  You can go through all.
[6069.16 --> 6069.68]  Go for it.
[6069.74 --> 6070.56]  I'm going to do it again.
[6070.68 --> 6071.36]  I'm going to do it again.
[6071.36 --> 6073.00]  Get the merch message out of the way.
[6073.00 --> 6073.84]  Yeah, get the merch message out of there.
[6073.92 --> 6075.10]  Get that merch message out of there.
[6075.24 --> 6075.82]  I'm doing it.
[6075.82 --> 6076.12]  I'm doing it.
[6076.14 --> 6076.44]  Hold on.
[6076.54 --> 6076.80]  I can move it.
[6076.80 --> 6077.42]  No, I'll move it down.
[6077.48 --> 6077.84]  I'll move it down.
[6077.84 --> 6078.28]  I got you.
[6078.34 --> 6078.86]  No, I got you.
[6078.88 --> 6079.42]  I got you, Dan.
[6079.46 --> 6080.12]  Okay, here you go.
[6080.50 --> 6081.24]  Okay, quick, quick.
[6081.32 --> 6081.66]  That one's...
[6081.66 --> 6083.00]  Quick, screenshot that white dot.
[6083.08 --> 6083.30]  Yeah.
[6086.56 --> 6088.50]  I actually love that Floatplane one.
[6088.50 --> 6091.78]  They also really don't have to be that fast because once they get the VOD, they can just
[6091.78 --> 6092.08]  part.
[6092.08 --> 6092.70]  They're really cool.
[6092.78 --> 6093.52]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6093.54 --> 6094.64]  They're like actually good.
[6094.74 --> 6095.68]  Yeah, well, of course they are.
[6095.76 --> 6096.02]  It's Sarah.
[6096.02 --> 6099.48]  I'm always blown away by the stuff that comes out of that company.
[6099.78 --> 6103.10]  Well, I thought she had like five minutes and would do like one.
[6103.54 --> 6104.42]  I didn't expect it was going to be a bunch.
[6104.42 --> 6105.36]  She did have like five minutes.
[6105.44 --> 6106.52]  She just has a lot of...
[6106.52 --> 6109.54]  She has just a lot of really great artwork that she's worked on over the years.
[6109.54 --> 6110.76]  And is extremely competent.
[6110.98 --> 6111.14]  Yeah.
[6111.86 --> 6113.56]  I like competent people.
[6115.08 --> 6116.22]  I just do.
[6116.60 --> 6117.24]  I really do.
[6119.86 --> 6120.66]  Let's play a game.
[6121.52 --> 6121.82]  Okay.
[6122.04 --> 6123.06]  Let's play a game really quick.
[6123.06 --> 6132.72]  Um, what do you think will be the dominant misinterpretation of that segment we just did?
[6132.90 --> 6134.72]  Oh, yeah, that's a good one.
[6136.30 --> 6146.78]  Um, downplaying the privacy stuff.
[6149.16 --> 6149.98]  Oh, okay.
[6150.14 --> 6150.36]  Okay.
[6150.38 --> 6151.34]  Well, let's address that then.
[6151.42 --> 6152.36]  Let's address that really quick.
[6152.36 --> 6153.42]  Like, it's really bad.
[6154.30 --> 6154.60]  Okay.
[6154.98 --> 6155.28]  Okay.
[6155.28 --> 6155.76]  What's next?
[6156.02 --> 6161.36]  Sounds like in, in, if I can throw my hat in the ring there as someone who has had to,
[6161.80 --> 6168.58]  in some cases, write, in other cases, work with lawyers to write in other, other cases,
[6168.98 --> 6173.24]  write, and then work with lawyers to write and then rewrite it for them and be like, is this better?
[6173.24 --> 6174.22]  And they're like, yeah.
[6174.32 --> 6174.96]  And I'm like, cool.
[6175.04 --> 6175.36]  Thanks.
[6175.56 --> 6175.76]  Yeah.
[6175.76 --> 6177.60]  Um, that has happened actually.
[6177.86 --> 6178.44]  More than once.
[6178.44 --> 6178.66]  More than once.
[6180.86 --> 6182.64]  Um, these things.
[6182.66 --> 6184.02]  More than he knows even.
[6184.38 --> 6184.98]  Yeah, I bet.
[6185.10 --> 6185.30]  Yeah.
[6185.68 --> 6186.60]  These things suck.
[6187.12 --> 6190.24]  And I, I have no idea.
[6190.38 --> 6192.40]  I have literally talked to none of them.
[6192.54 --> 6192.72]  Yeah.
[6192.72 --> 6196.52]  I bet you they were just like, Hey, lawyer people, can you please write one of these for
[6196.52 --> 6196.68]  us?
[6196.68 --> 6197.38]  And they were like, sure.
[6197.60 --> 6197.96]  Blank.
[6197.96 --> 6204.10]  And just wrote it too aggressive because in a tweet that I saw, I think they were like,
[6204.14 --> 6205.38]  yeah, we're not even gathering all this stuff.
[6205.44 --> 6209.20]  We just like wrote it too, too harsh.
[6209.98 --> 6210.38]  Yeah.
[6210.70 --> 6211.16]  I do.
[6211.30 --> 6215.06]  I suspect there is some amount of stuff for the free tier for the advertisement delivery,
[6215.14 --> 6215.62]  stuff like that.
[6215.62 --> 6220.60]  And there is, there is some stuff they really just like needed to not do like that.
[6220.60 --> 6224.10]  Like the whole thing about, yeah, it took a colossal amount of work to make it launch
[6224.10 --> 6226.04]  on Android and iOS at the same time.
[6226.04 --> 6228.22]  When it's a multi, Kotlin multi-platform.
[6228.56 --> 6230.44]  There was a, there was a couple things.
[6230.66 --> 6235.32]  Why say that if you like, don't, you know, didn't do that.
[6235.92 --> 6241.78]  If it was, maybe give us a ring next time we got you.
[6242.22 --> 6247.30]  It is actually kind of funny to me how often I watch other creators just like stumble through
[6247.30 --> 6247.86]  things.
[6248.92 --> 6250.26]  Making stuff is hard.
[6250.44 --> 6256.00]  When, when, when we already stumbled through it and like they have my digits and like had
[6256.00 --> 6257.48]  been happy to chat with them about it.
[6257.54 --> 6257.96]  I don't know.
[6258.18 --> 6263.88]  I, you know, on the other hand though, we, we, we can, we can kind of, we can YOLO things
[6263.88 --> 6264.36]  as well.
[6264.36 --> 6266.46]  We YOLO things as well.
[6266.66 --> 6267.64]  That's a really good point.
[6267.80 --> 6269.66]  We do that literally all the time.
[6270.46 --> 6270.74]  Yep.
[6270.74 --> 6278.44]  Maybe, maybe creators just actually kind of suck at reaching out sometimes, including
[6278.44 --> 6280.18]  very much us.
[6282.22 --> 6284.04]  There's, there's some, there's some pretty good ones.
[6284.10 --> 6285.46]  There's some pretty good ones in the chat.
[6286.52 --> 6292.60]  Linus doesn't understand how words change over time, which is just another way of them
[6292.60 --> 6297.48]  saying they don't understand that scam actually does have a definition and it doesn't mean that.
[6297.48 --> 6299.78]  Uh, we got another one.
[6299.96 --> 6303.70]  Linus is just out to protect other tech tubers, unwilling to criticize them.
[6304.40 --> 6306.22]  Um, we, we straight up did.
[6306.82 --> 6308.40]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[6308.40 --> 6309.16]  This isn't, no, no, no.
[6309.20 --> 6309.44]  It's not.
[6309.56 --> 6312.48]  Oh, these are theories on what the controversy might be.
[6312.82 --> 6313.66]  Don't be so defensive.
[6314.02 --> 6315.70]  For once it's him and not me.
[6315.80 --> 6316.44]  This is great.
[6316.78 --> 6317.46]  Let's fight.
[6317.98 --> 6320.22]  Oh no, there was another, there was another really good one.
[6320.30 --> 6321.20]  There was another really good one.
[6321.70 --> 6326.50]  Uh, Linus criticizes Marquez's wallpapers, then launches his own behind a subscription.
[6326.50 --> 6327.98]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[6328.10 --> 6329.34]  At the same price.
[6329.44 --> 6330.56]  Actually accurate take.
[6330.86 --> 6331.14]  Yeah.
[6331.30 --> 6332.42]  Actually accurate take.
[6332.58 --> 6332.86]  Yeah.
[6332.98 --> 6333.50]  I love it.
[6334.10 --> 6338.10]  Um, Trevor, Trevor W. asks, bad faith question.
[6338.20 --> 6339.98]  How is this different than your stance on horse armor?
[6340.34 --> 6347.40]  My stance on horse armor is that it, it was the first pebble rolling down the hill that
[6347.40 --> 6351.14]  caused an avalanche of colossal shittiness in gaming.
[6351.32 --> 6354.68]  Which fundamentally changed how games are made and played moving forward.
[6354.68 --> 6357.32]  Nobody is buying this wallpaper app.
[6357.46 --> 6358.82]  This is not going to change.
[6359.04 --> 6360.14]  I guarantee you some people do.
[6360.30 --> 6360.94]  Okay, sure.
[6361.08 --> 6366.22]  But this is not going to fundamentally change anything about the wallpaper economy, which
[6366.22 --> 6371.62]  is infinitesimally, I forget the word, but whatever.
[6371.74 --> 6373.98]  It's, it's, it's vanishingly small.
[6373.98 --> 6378.52]  And the idea of paying for wallpapers has existed for decades.
[6378.72 --> 6383.30]  And the number of people who pay for them is still exactly what it is today.
[6383.38 --> 6388.84]  This is going to change nothing is, is sort of why I don't really care about it.
[6388.84 --> 6389.12]  Yeah.
[6391.36 --> 6391.88]  Yeah.
[6391.96 --> 6393.82]  I think the negative reaction to it was overblown.
[6394.30 --> 6399.92]  Um, I think the negative reaction to a lot of stuff in this space is insanely overblown
[6399.92 --> 6401.56]  and has been for a while now.
[6401.62 --> 6402.08]  I do.
[6402.20 --> 6408.68]  I do also understand why, um, like why people were so frustrated in this case.
[6408.68 --> 6415.84]  I mean, because it's someone whose job is to advise people on making good value decisions
[6415.84 --> 6418.68]  when they purchase mobile electronics.
[6419.58 --> 6423.78]  Um, and this doesn't seem to be aligned with that.
[6424.42 --> 6430.44]  Um, I do think that I do think that there's also some friction that's around just paying
[6430.44 --> 6430.90]  for art.
[6431.04 --> 6435.64]  Um, and I think that's contributing to the outrage, but I do also, I do see where people
[6435.64 --> 6436.38]  are coming from.
[6436.38 --> 6439.84]  Um, I just think that this could have been messaged better.
[6439.98 --> 6441.02]  It could have been handled better.
[6441.14 --> 6442.54]  It didn't have to be a disaster.
[6442.68 --> 6446.06]  And I think that in the longer term, I just think it won't be overblown.
[6446.16 --> 6453.76]  Like we saw, we saw like genuinely taking over the internet level trending of people just
[6453.76 --> 6455.80]  like trying to light them on fire.
[6455.80 --> 6458.14]  And it's like, yeah, it's been a lot.
[6458.46 --> 6459.36]  Maybe chill.
[6459.66 --> 6460.56]  It's been a lot.
[6460.56 --> 6462.92]  Like you can, you can express your.
[6462.92 --> 6471.12]  Like it's not good, but I can personally think of times that would have made more sense to
[6471.12 --> 6472.08]  light Marquez up over.
[6472.54 --> 6478.46]  Like it's just, well, no, I, I just, I just mean it's, yeah, it's an overpriced product.
[6478.86 --> 6479.30]  Yeah.
[6480.02 --> 6480.42]  Dude.
[6480.42 --> 6484.00]  And there's some, there's some, yeah.
[6485.48 --> 6489.98]  Subjectively, subjectively, by the way, I just got, I don't know how crystal manages this,
[6490.06 --> 6492.62]  but she manages like something I respond to.
[6492.68 --> 6498.50]  And basically like every show, it feels like at Linus, we need a scam shirt.
[6498.50 --> 6503.84]  It's exactly the same as every other shirt, but it costs like, but it costs like four
[6503.84 --> 6506.14]  times as much and just says scam on the front.
[6506.66 --> 6510.30]  I am so down and I'm down right now.
[6510.86 --> 6512.92]  I am sending this to Nick and Sarah.
[6513.08 --> 6515.22]  I am sending it to them right now.
[6516.30 --> 6522.32]  I will bring you, I will bring you the biggest scam t-shirt that you have ever seen.
[6522.32 --> 6528.40]  Oh, what if you, what if you, it's probably not worth it, but what if you got it like poorly
[6528.40 --> 6528.82]  printed?
[6530.12 --> 6531.44]  No, unacceptable.
[6531.82 --> 6532.06]  Yeah.
[6532.32 --> 6533.04]  I wouldn't do that.
[6533.16 --> 6533.40]  Okay.
[6533.96 --> 6535.92]  Actually, or what if we didn't print it at all?
[6536.14 --> 6539.72]  What if it's just our blank shirt and it just costs more?
[6542.22 --> 6546.20]  It's, it's, it's our blank shirt and we just like include a Sharpie.
[6546.96 --> 6552.22]  No, we should, we should put like, we should, we should screen print like a little scam
[6552.22 --> 6553.38]  like on the inside.
[6553.88 --> 6557.62]  So you'll know you got scammed, but no one else will see it.
[6558.34 --> 6559.32]  It's pretty good.
[6559.58 --> 6561.06]  Um, okay.
[6561.10 --> 6565.46]  Well, we'll work, we'll work on some concepts for a scam shirt, but what I can promise you
[6565.46 --> 6568.10]  is that it will cost more than our regular shirt.
[6568.58 --> 6571.16]  That's the only thing that I will promise you right now.
[6571.54 --> 6572.94]  It will be more expensive.
[6574.06 --> 6574.46]  Why?
[6576.26 --> 6577.56]  Cause you got scammed.
[6577.72 --> 6577.86]  Yeah.
[6577.96 --> 6578.46]  That's why.
[6578.54 --> 6578.92]  Okay.
[6580.22 --> 6580.54]  Oh, wait.
[6580.54 --> 6581.10]  It's not even a scam.
[6581.10 --> 6582.40]  No, it's not even a scam.
[6582.54 --> 6582.70]  Yeah.
[6582.78 --> 6583.02]  Okay.
[6583.26 --> 6583.54]  Okay.
[6583.54 --> 6585.04]  We'll have to make some, oh no.
[6585.12 --> 6585.90]  Oh, this is dangerous.
[6585.90 --> 6586.90]  I don't think you can actually do it.
[6586.90 --> 6588.00]  No, I can't actually.
[6588.28 --> 6588.48]  Yeah.
[6588.64 --> 6588.90]  Okay.
[6588.94 --> 6589.46]  Well, whatever.
[6589.54 --> 6590.58]  You'll think it's a scam.
[6590.80 --> 6592.26]  Maybe put scam in quotes.
[6593.46 --> 6593.78]  Hmm.
[6595.04 --> 6595.22]  Okay.
[6595.22 --> 6596.32]  Well, we'll, we'll work on it.
[6596.38 --> 6597.36]  Well, we're going to work on it.
[6597.40 --> 6598.24]  We're going to work on it.
[6598.98 --> 6602.42]  You could, uh, you could pay to have the concept of a shirt shipped to you and then you
[6602.42 --> 6603.26]  just ship them a box.
[6605.30 --> 6607.54]  We could share half of the profits with MKBHD.
[6607.54 --> 6611.40]  We could, uh, people are just, they're, they're offering, they're offering suggestions.
[6612.06 --> 6614.32]  Uh, workshop the scam shirt.
[6615.60 --> 6618.24]  Now I'm going to, I'm going to let, I'm going to let Sarah do her magic.
[6618.38 --> 6619.16]  You've, you've already seen.
[6619.20 --> 6623.00]  I just, I think people going in and being like, you've ruined your whole reputation for
[6623.00 --> 6624.72]  Oh, that's so stupid.
[6624.72 --> 6626.84]  But this is, but like there was a lot of people.
[6627.22 --> 6627.92]  That's so stupid.
[6628.26 --> 6629.68]  It's like, guys, chill.
[6630.28 --> 6632.72]  It's, it's, it's all the people who have never made a mistake.
[6632.84 --> 6633.12]  Yeah.
[6633.42 --> 6635.32]  Like it's the never made a mistake crowd.
[6635.68 --> 6636.04]  Relax.
[6636.20 --> 6636.76]  I don't know.
[6636.82 --> 6637.18]  I don't know.
[6637.22 --> 6639.98]  I mentioned this on the pre-show and we're deep enough in the show now.
[6640.04 --> 6646.58]  Maybe I'll just say it, but like, honestly, I'm pretty thrilled with Marquez right now.
[6647.14 --> 6648.20]  Oh, you're right.
[6648.32 --> 6648.54]  Right.
[6648.66 --> 6648.82]  Yeah.
[6648.92 --> 6649.06]  Yeah.
[6649.06 --> 6649.16]  Yeah.
[6649.92 --> 6655.40]  He has single-handedly done more to take the heat off of me for a change than any other
[6655.40 --> 6657.08]  human being on the face of the planet.
[6659.44 --> 6660.46]  Thank you, Marquez.
[6660.46 --> 6660.78]  Yes.
[6661.58 --> 6665.58]  For once, I am not the most controversial tech chupers.
[6668.18 --> 6668.90]  It's nice.
[6669.28 --> 6669.70]  It's nice.
[6669.86 --> 6670.10]  Yeah.
[6670.16 --> 6673.30]  I feel like I need like a celebratory donut or something.
[6673.40 --> 6675.42]  Like I just, it feels good.
[6675.56 --> 6676.26]  It feels good.
[6676.44 --> 6678.72]  Send them like a thank you cake or something.
[6679.42 --> 6680.68]  Mind you, mind you.
[6680.76 --> 6686.48]  Now that we've, now that we've launched our own, our own wallpaper subscription, maybe we'll
[6686.48 --> 6688.28]  be embroiled in the same controversy.
[6688.28 --> 6688.80]  Yeah.
[6688.80 --> 6696.14]  I mentioned you can get yours now at floatplane.com slash post slash Z4G.
[6696.26 --> 6696.74]  Well, whatever.
[6696.86 --> 6697.84]  You'll, you'll figure it out.
[6698.10 --> 6698.22]  Yeah.
[6698.24 --> 6699.22]  You guys will figure it out.
[6699.42 --> 6699.62]  Yeah.
[6700.30 --> 6701.00]  Oh my God.
[6701.48 --> 6702.32]  This is so funny.
[6702.32 --> 6704.22]  Apparently all the wallpapers are already posted on Reddit.
[6704.54 --> 6705.38]  Yeah, of course they are.
[6706.32 --> 6707.82]  This is, dude, this is great.
[6707.90 --> 6709.02]  Look at the comments on this.
[6709.78 --> 6711.46]  I never thought I'd subbed to floatplane.
[6711.54 --> 6712.30]  This was too good of a deal.
[6712.52 --> 6713.86]  I think I missed some context.
[6714.18 --> 6715.38]  Why is everyone saying scam?
[6715.60 --> 6716.68]  I know it's a joke, but.
[6719.54 --> 6720.58]  Oh my goodness.
[6720.70 --> 6721.42]  This is amazing.
[6721.56 --> 6721.74]  Yeah.
[6721.80 --> 6722.56]  Thank you guys so much.
[6722.56 --> 6725.88]  I used Riley 24 to subscribe and download these.
[6726.04 --> 6727.48]  That's pretty good as well, actually.
[6728.00 --> 6731.42]  Cause they're, they're tracking that to see how well the, the concept.
[6731.60 --> 6732.28]  Oh, thank you.
[6732.36 --> 6732.78]  Thank you.
[6733.10 --> 6736.04]  We genuinely appreciate your guys' support by the way.
[6736.44 --> 6739.00]  Floatplane pays for our development team.
[6739.10 --> 6743.42]  It pays for people like Sammy to, to do their jobs, bringing you guys great behind the scenes
[6743.42 --> 6743.94]  content.
[6744.56 --> 6745.20]  Thank you.
[6745.32 --> 6746.14]  Thank you very much.
[6746.22 --> 6746.88]  The wallpapers.
[6747.44 --> 6753.02]  If you decide to throw a couple of bucks at it, Hey, we, we, we got to pay Sarah somehow.
[6753.20 --> 6757.74]  You should probably after go check out the exclusives or something, which is what the
[6757.74 --> 6759.04]  platform's like actually for.
[6759.04 --> 6761.92]  It's very unlikely we're ever going to upload wallpapers again.
[6762.00 --> 6763.14]  This is not a wallpaper thing.
[6763.44 --> 6765.34]  Also, we might be bringing back some early access.
[6766.36 --> 6766.76]  Oh, cool.
[6766.84 --> 6766.96]  Yeah.
[6766.98 --> 6770.98]  Not across the board, but selectively, um, to add to the floatplane fun, we're doing
[6770.98 --> 6774.40]  an early access release for our newest secret shopper this time.
[6774.48 --> 6775.82]  Who are we secret shopping?
[6776.30 --> 6778.08]  I'm actually pretty excited about this.
[6780.38 --> 6780.82]  Framework.
[6781.32 --> 6782.80]  We secret shopped framework.
[6783.30 --> 6784.38]  Linus is not involved.
[6784.58 --> 6785.42]  They don't know.
[6786.22 --> 6786.68]  They know now.
[6786.68 --> 6787.72]  Did we talk about this last week?
[6787.84 --> 6788.50]  I don't think so.
[6788.50 --> 6789.16]  Oh, okay.
[6789.68 --> 6791.54]  So I, I'm pretty sure I learned about it today.
[6791.54 --> 6794.00]  So yeah, they don't, they don't know.
[6794.56 --> 6797.28]  Um, they are finding out probably now.
[6797.50 --> 6797.68]  Yeah.
[6797.74 --> 6798.24]  Right now.
[6798.38 --> 6798.56]  Yep.
[6798.76 --> 6800.28]  Someone's sending a frantic message.
[6800.48 --> 6801.36]  Which order was it?
[6801.74 --> 6803.06]  Um, yeah.
[6803.38 --> 6804.64]  Do you have them shipped here?
[6805.06 --> 6805.40]  No.
[6805.60 --> 6805.72]  Yeah.
[6805.74 --> 6806.30]  I didn't think so.
[6806.30 --> 6806.44]  Of course not.
[6806.60 --> 6806.74]  Yeah.
[6806.82 --> 6806.94]  Yeah.
[6806.94 --> 6808.88]  Also, I didn't have them do anything.
[6808.98 --> 6809.66]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[6809.76 --> 6811.32]  We, I, I, this was all.
[6811.32 --> 6812.26]  Apparently it was mentioned last week.
[6812.30 --> 6812.84]  I don't remember that.
[6812.92 --> 6813.06]  Okay.
[6813.18 --> 6813.40]  Weird.
[6813.40 --> 6814.56]  Well, it was all delegated.
[6814.66 --> 6815.98]  I recused myself.
[6816.88 --> 6820.00]  Anyway, uh, it comes out tomorrow, September 28th on float plane.
[6820.00 --> 6821.46]  And then later on in the week on YouTube.
[6821.72 --> 6821.90]  Cool.
[6822.00 --> 6823.98]  Uh, finally, the last announcements thing.
[6824.02 --> 6825.76]  We gotta, we gotta pair these down a little bit next week.
[6825.84 --> 6826.04]  Yeah.
[6826.04 --> 6827.06]  Is Ridge Wallet Collab.
[6827.20 --> 6829.26]  We've been working with Ridge for five plus years.
[6829.38 --> 6830.66]  Oh, oh, sick.
[6831.02 --> 6832.62]  And we finally got around.
[6833.48 --> 6833.76]  Whoops.
[6834.72 --> 6835.12]  Whoops.
[6835.22 --> 6835.42]  Whoops.
[6835.58 --> 6835.80]  Whoops.
[6835.96 --> 6836.52]  I'll get this.
[6836.84 --> 6840.78]  We finally got around to doing a proper product collab.
[6841.22 --> 6844.14]  This is on a wallet that we'll be launching on October 1st.
[6844.14 --> 6848.48]  It has a cool circuit board design from our one and only Sarah Butt.
[6848.94 --> 6852.56]  And it comes with both a cash strap and a money clip.
[6852.56 --> 6858.56]  And it has extra silver screws in the box so you can change the look according to your tastes.
[6859.16 --> 6860.80]  Maybe you had to drop something.
[6861.22 --> 6862.00]  Well, look.
[6862.12 --> 6862.44]  Okay.
[6862.68 --> 6866.16]  I saw the sticker and I was like, wow, I'm surprised you saved that.
[6866.42 --> 6866.78]  All right.
[6866.84 --> 6867.46]  So there you go.
[6867.68 --> 6868.60]  There's your money clip.
[6868.78 --> 6872.56]  And then there's the super cool like circuit inspired design.
[6873.42 --> 6873.90]  Looks sharp.
[6874.16 --> 6874.90]  Very cool.
[6876.80 --> 6877.34]  All right.
[6877.36 --> 6878.52]  What else are we talking about today?
[6878.62 --> 6878.88]  Oh, wait.
[6878.94 --> 6879.84]  Is this after dark, Dan?
[6880.52 --> 6881.92]  I can never tell anymore.
[6881.92 --> 6883.64]  No, we're not in after dark yet.
[6883.66 --> 6884.54]  It says that on the thing.
[6884.54 --> 6885.64]  What's going on with your phone, dude?
[6885.70 --> 6887.44]  That means you're supposed to do it.
[6887.44 --> 6888.32]  We can talk about that in after dark.
[6889.10 --> 6891.54]  We've got, what, 45 minutes left?
[6891.78 --> 6893.72]  Did we talk about YouTube premium prices going up?
[6894.20 --> 6894.64]  I don't think so.
[6894.74 --> 6897.72]  Well, they're going up in a lot of parts of the world and that's a bummer.
[6898.14 --> 6898.50]  Okay.
[6898.70 --> 6898.84]  There.
[6898.94 --> 6899.76]  We did a quick one there.
[6900.38 --> 6901.84]  We might see Hi-Fi Rush 2.
[6902.22 --> 6902.82]  That's exciting.
[6903.46 --> 6903.78]  Nice.
[6906.22 --> 6907.94]  Floppy Bird returns, but it's a scam.
[6908.52 --> 6908.88]  Okay.
[6909.02 --> 6910.76]  Might actually legitimately be a scam.
[6910.76 --> 6911.98]  I'm not sure, but maybe.
[6912.12 --> 6912.72]  Don't do that.
[6913.16 --> 6914.68]  And Discord introduces Dave.
[6915.08 --> 6917.62]  They're rolling out end-to-end encryption for audio and video calls.
[6917.62 --> 6923.72]  It will not, however, be encrypting text communication, which they say is to facilitate moderation
[6923.72 --> 6925.16]  and ensure safety on the platform.
[6925.90 --> 6927.98]  But if it's an audio call, then you don't need to.
[6928.02 --> 6928.22]  Anyway.
[6928.60 --> 6932.64]  Discord's current moderation involves both user reporting and a combination of image hashing
[6932.64 --> 6934.40]  and machine scanning to flag CSAM.
[6934.84 --> 6938.54]  Other forms of automated moderation are controlled by community moderators on the server level.
[6938.54 --> 6943.48]  The full technical details for Discord's audio-visual end-to-end encryption protocol, which they
[6943.48 --> 6947.48]  call Dave, is outloaded, outlined in a white paper they've published.
[6947.66 --> 6951.92]  Likewise, its backing libraries are open source to allow for public transparency and scrutiny
[6951.92 --> 6953.02]  by security researchers.
[6953.14 --> 6954.02]  At least it's progress.
[6954.40 --> 6955.08]  I'll say that much.
[6955.50 --> 6955.70]  Sure.
[6956.36 --> 6956.86]  All right.
[6957.10 --> 6958.36]  Let's switch over to After Dark.
[6959.04 --> 6959.44]  Shall we?
[6960.42 --> 6960.68]  Yeah.
[6960.80 --> 6961.70]  Yes, we shall.
[6963.58 --> 6964.02]  Okay.
[6964.26 --> 6966.02]  Phone time while he gets set up.
[6966.10 --> 6966.60]  Oh, okay.
[6966.78 --> 6966.94]  Yeah.
[6966.94 --> 6967.34]  Really?
[6967.44 --> 6968.30]  Is this that important to you?
[6968.32 --> 6970.22]  Just why won't you say it?
[6971.00 --> 6972.38]  I think that's why I'm so interested.
[6973.02 --> 6973.84]  I'm being baited.
[6974.44 --> 6977.48]  So, Dan, can I ask you to do me a big favor?
[6977.76 --> 6978.02]  Yes.
[6978.38 --> 6979.74]  It's not going to be an easy favor.
[6980.30 --> 6980.68]  Oh, boy.
[6982.58 --> 6983.40]  What are you trying to do?
[6983.46 --> 6983.94]  I need...
[6984.88 --> 6985.88]  Um...
[6985.88 --> 6986.94]  I need the entire...
[6987.76 --> 6991.14]  I need the entire place to go completely dark.
[6991.72 --> 6992.00]  Oh.
[6992.44 --> 6992.88]  Oh, okay.
[6993.12 --> 6993.62]  Can you do that?
[6993.62 --> 6994.92]  I think that's actually pretty easy for him.
[6994.92 --> 6997.76]  Ideally, this one last.
[6998.62 --> 6999.02]  Which...
[6999.02 --> 6999.62]  For the overhead?
[6999.90 --> 7000.44]  Yes, sir.
[7007.24 --> 7009.64]  Feel free to do a merch message or something in the meantime, Luke.
[7010.34 --> 7010.82]  Oh, sure.
[7011.08 --> 7012.02]  There's a bunch in there for you.
[7012.44 --> 7012.78]  Okay.
[7014.46 --> 7015.12]  Uno momento.
[7015.12 --> 7015.22]  Uno momento.
[7015.22 --> 7020.96]  And then...
[7020.96 --> 7023.40]  I've got to get the back ones.
[7023.78 --> 7024.64]  The back ones are manual.
[7024.74 --> 7025.60]  We have to climb a ladder.
[7025.80 --> 7027.14]  No, we just turn everything off.
[7027.64 --> 7029.10]  Oh, well, I have to climb a ladder.
[7029.32 --> 7030.18]  Maybe Dan can reach.
[7030.58 --> 7032.08]  Okay, let's see what this breaks.
[7032.28 --> 7032.90]  Should just be nothing.
[7033.46 --> 7033.74]  You ready?
[7034.56 --> 7035.48]  Oh, God.
[7035.54 --> 7036.60]  You're turning off the battery backup?
[7037.00 --> 7037.22]  Yeah.
[7037.22 --> 7037.70]  Okay.
[7038.18 --> 7038.58]  Okay.
[7039.24 --> 7039.50]  Ready?
[7040.62 --> 7041.50]  Yeah, I guess.
[7043.42 --> 7043.82]  Whoa!
[7045.96 --> 7046.32]  Whoa!
[7048.50 --> 7049.40]  That's so bright.
[7049.42 --> 7049.96]  Hold on, hold on.
[7050.00 --> 7051.90]  I'm going to have to play around with the focus a little bit here.
[7053.28 --> 7055.82]  Yeah, because it looks way better in person.
[7060.44 --> 7062.60]  It's going to have a hard time in the dark, I think.
[7062.60 --> 7067.00]  That's very bright.
[7076.26 --> 7076.66]  So...
[7076.66 --> 7078.28]  Okay, you can finish when the light's back on.
[7080.28 --> 7082.00]  Chat's actually asking the same question I have.
[7082.10 --> 7083.60]  How much radiation...
[7084.76 --> 7085.82]  How much radiation?
[7085.92 --> 7086.20]  Yeah, what is it?
[7086.20 --> 7087.14]  Well, this is glow-in-the-dark.
[7087.40 --> 7087.86]  Yeah, what is it?
[7087.86 --> 7088.50]  Are we still live?
[7088.66 --> 7089.14]  Okay, yeah, we are.
[7089.92 --> 7090.38]  Sorry, what?
[7090.38 --> 7091.30]  What makes it glow-in-the-dark?
[7091.30 --> 7092.78]  It's cool.
[7094.62 --> 7095.36]  What is it?
[7095.48 --> 7095.88]  It's cool.
[7096.04 --> 7098.30]  Why are you being so cagey about your phone skin?
[7098.76 --> 7101.56]  Because, I don't know, some stuff might happen.
[7102.04 --> 7102.90]  Did you make this?
[7103.04 --> 7104.50]  Because how is it for that phone?
[7104.62 --> 7105.12]  That's another...
[7105.12 --> 7107.10]  I think that's the thing that's been driving me the most.
[7107.10 --> 7108.38]  What, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9?
[7108.46 --> 7110.96]  This is a popular device that many people still enjoy.
[7111.24 --> 7113.34]  Yeah, how do you have a...
[7113.34 --> 7115.40]  So, this was custom-made for you?
[7117.18 --> 7118.54]  Oh, man, it's textured, too.
[7118.66 --> 7119.18]  Isn't that cool?
[7119.36 --> 7120.60]  That's really nice, actually.
[7120.60 --> 7121.72]  Pretty cool, eh?
[7121.84 --> 7123.62]  It's also our company's orange.
[7124.82 --> 7126.24]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[7126.58 --> 7127.04]  Interesting.
[7127.96 --> 7128.92]  It feels nice.
[7129.12 --> 7129.68]  Yeah, I know.
[7130.46 --> 7131.28]  Kind of grippy.
[7131.70 --> 7132.46]  Kind of feels good.
[7133.48 --> 7134.68]  Yeah, interesting, right?
[7139.30 --> 7139.92]  All right.
[7140.34 --> 7140.80]  Cool.
[7141.06 --> 7141.32]  Okay.
[7141.32 --> 7143.62]  I'm sure I'll have more to say at some point.
[7144.10 --> 7144.32]  Yeah.
[7144.80 --> 7146.24]  But, um...
[7146.24 --> 7147.00]  Photo for essence.
[7147.16 --> 7147.88]  Is that fine?
[7149.06 --> 7153.52]  All I know about glow-in-the-dark stuff is they used to do it with incredibly radioactive stuff.
[7153.66 --> 7153.84]  Oh, no.
[7153.84 --> 7154.86]  That was a long time ago.
[7155.00 --> 7156.22]  Ethically sourced radon now.
[7157.38 --> 7159.70]  Yeah, I'm just going to give them a closer look at it.
[7159.92 --> 7161.36]  And then you can feel free to do it.
[7161.36 --> 7162.16]  It looks sharp.
[7162.50 --> 7162.62]  Sure.
[7162.82 --> 7163.06]  All right.
[7163.06 --> 7163.78]  For Luke.
[7164.02 --> 7164.72]  Hey, Wan.
[7165.28 --> 7171.12]  Luke, if you can share, what is the Flowplane algorithm for deciding username color on a live?
[7171.70 --> 7172.42]  In live chat, yeah.
[7172.44 --> 7173.22]  I guess live chat.
[7173.34 --> 7173.46]  Yeah.
[7176.72 --> 7177.72]  We're just stopping it there?
[7177.82 --> 7178.46]  We're not doing the...
[7178.46 --> 7180.42]  Oh, there's a Linus question after that.
[7180.44 --> 7180.72]  I see.
[7180.80 --> 7180.98]  Okay.
[7181.06 --> 7181.38]  Got it.
[7181.38 --> 7183.10]  I don't remember.
[7183.24 --> 7184.80]  That's entirely a Jaden thing.
[7186.06 --> 7186.82]  I think it's a secret.
[7186.82 --> 7189.12]  If I remember correctly, I don't think it's a secret.
[7189.30 --> 7190.38]  I think, yeah.
[7190.86 --> 7192.40]  Conrad's saying it's just a hash table.
[7192.64 --> 7196.44]  I thought it was either that or it was the first letter that it was based off of.
[7196.96 --> 7198.00]  Yeah, you can see the texture.
[7198.00 --> 7198.42]  Something like that.
[7198.50 --> 7198.94]  Yeah, there you go.
[7198.98 --> 7199.08]  Perfect.
[7199.08 --> 7206.12]  If I remember correctly, you can even play with the capitalization of your name and it will change it or something.
[7206.60 --> 7207.74]  I don't remember exactly how it works.
[7207.74 --> 7214.66]  If you ever see Jaden in the chat, poke him and he'll be able to tell you if he feels like it.
[7214.70 --> 7217.06]  Or he won't because he might not feel like it because he's not on shift.
[7219.20 --> 7219.92]  Sounds about right.
[7219.94 --> 7220.82]  I'm not going to tell him what to do.
[7221.64 --> 7222.42]  Yeah, that's it.
[7222.68 --> 7226.82]  Linus, how do you feel about PlayStation raising the prices on Horizon Zero Dawn?
[7228.00 --> 7229.52]  Is this for the remaster or whatever?
[7230.32 --> 7233.02]  Like it's $10 more, but now it's the remaster or something?
[7233.18 --> 7234.56]  Or what are we talking about?
[7236.00 --> 7236.76]  Raising the price?
[7236.76 --> 7239.52]  I heard something happened, but I don't know.
[7239.76 --> 7240.04]  I don't know.
[7240.10 --> 7241.16]  It costs however much it costs.
[7241.22 --> 7244.54]  If you like the price and you buy it at the price, if you don't like the price, you don't pay for it.
[7245.88 --> 7250.98]  PlayStation quietly raises Horizon Zero Dawn PS4 price following remaster announcement.
[7252.78 --> 7254.24]  Yeah, I guess don't buy it.
[7254.74 --> 7256.32]  I mean, I don't know, guys.
[7256.38 --> 7256.82]  Come on.
[7257.74 --> 7258.74]  Like, yeah, it sucks.
[7258.90 --> 7259.86]  Games cost a lot of money.
[7259.98 --> 7263.64]  But like you had like four, five years to buy Horizon.
[7263.70 --> 7265.44]  When did Horizon Zero Dawn come out?
[7265.44 --> 7266.38]  Yeah, really.
[7267.02 --> 7271.30]  Horizon Zero Dawn release PS4.
[7271.40 --> 7274.18]  Because like I bought it on PC like three years ago, I feel like.
[7274.52 --> 7276.50]  Dude, this game came out in 2017.
[7277.16 --> 7278.62]  It came out seven years ago.
[7278.86 --> 7280.58]  If you wanted to play it, just play it.
[7281.78 --> 7283.36]  I don't know, guys.
[7284.84 --> 7285.62]  It's a scam.
[7286.00 --> 7286.16]  There.
[7287.02 --> 7287.44]  It's a scam.
[7287.84 --> 7288.18]  It's a scam.
[7288.38 --> 7288.50]  It's a scam.
[7288.50 --> 7289.82]  Scam.
[7290.46 --> 7293.08]  I mean, I'm not a fan of game prices going up.
[7293.14 --> 7296.72]  But like, honestly, we've talked about it extensively on the show before.
[7296.92 --> 7301.82]  The fact that game prices haven't gone up a lot more is crazy.
[7302.18 --> 7306.64]  I feel like it's been a standoff where different companies are just like, who's going to go first?
[7306.84 --> 7313.92]  Dude, there's probably more people who work in the marketing department of a modern AAA game than worked on Super Mario World in its entirety.
[7313.92 --> 7314.24]  Right?
[7314.98 --> 7315.40]  Like, it's.
[7316.72 --> 7321.08]  And that was a $60 cartridge back in 1994.
[7321.92 --> 7322.36]  93?
[7323.08 --> 7324.60]  When did Super Mario World come out?
[7324.88 --> 7325.98]  Was it 92, was it?
[7326.02 --> 7326.78]  I think it was 93.
[7327.40 --> 7328.08]  Was it two?
[7329.42 --> 7329.82]  1990!
[7330.36 --> 7330.92]  Good Lord!
[7331.22 --> 7331.42]  Right?
[7331.64 --> 7333.04]  So, yeah.
[7333.16 --> 7334.62]  Games are flipping expensive.
[7334.76 --> 7339.14]  I mean, do I think the whole we're remastering a seven-year-old game thing is a little bit ridiculous?
[7339.14 --> 7344.50]  And sort of, you know, playing around with the hype cycle and the fact that it's in the news and raising the price or whatever.
[7344.60 --> 7345.58]  It's like, yeah, sure, whatever.
[7345.98 --> 7347.88]  But realistically, guys, this is games.
[7348.12 --> 7351.72]  Wait another three months and it's probably going to be on sale again or whatever.
[7351.78 --> 7352.92]  And you can get it for a lower price.
[7352.98 --> 7353.36]  Like, I really.
[7353.86 --> 7354.98]  Yeah, I don't think it's.
[7355.06 --> 7356.12]  I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[7356.40 --> 7358.02]  Personally, I'm sorry.
[7358.64 --> 7359.12]  Man, I'm.
[7359.64 --> 7360.16]  I'm going to.
[7360.54 --> 7361.18]  I'm going to get.
[7361.36 --> 7362.16]  I'm going to get in trouble.
[7365.32 --> 7365.98]  Ah, okay.
[7366.12 --> 7366.66]  I see.
[7367.44 --> 7368.64]  I knew there'd be more to it.
[7369.14 --> 7369.62]  Um.
[7372.44 --> 7373.52]  Naturally, when people saw the.
[7373.64 --> 7373.94]  This is.
[7374.06 --> 7375.32]  I'm reading off of Dual Shockers.
[7375.52 --> 7376.86]  I'm going to just share my screen.
[7377.14 --> 7379.66]  Uh, because they seem to have actually pretty good coverage of this.
[7379.96 --> 7383.82]  Uh, naturally, when people saw the price spike of Horizon Zero Dawn, it left them scratching their heads.
[7383.92 --> 7384.48]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[7384.58 --> 7386.40]  It's, it's like almost doubled in.
[7386.50 --> 7387.80]  Or it's effectively doubled in price.
[7388.74 --> 7389.72]  Following the.
[7389.84 --> 7392.34]  The title of this article is it closes a loophole.
[7392.72 --> 7393.58]  So I was like, what does that mean?
[7394.14 --> 7394.50]  Uh.
[7394.84 --> 7395.50]  Apparently, you.
[7395.62 --> 7395.90]  If you.
[7396.02 --> 7399.12]  If you own the original version, you can upgrade to the remaster version.
[7399.32 --> 7401.58]  So they released the remaster version at this price.
[7401.66 --> 7403.78]  People were just buying the old one and then upgrading.
[7404.12 --> 7405.00]  Oh, I've got it.
[7405.08 --> 7405.32]  Okay.
[7405.46 --> 7406.26]  Uh, so.
[7407.68 --> 7408.04]  Okay.
[7408.24 --> 7409.00]  Well, that makes sense.
[7409.88 --> 7414.32]  Luca 103 on the subject of scams asks, where's your iPhone Linus?
[7414.32 --> 7418.78]  After I shot the short circuit, they needed it for some other content.
[7418.78 --> 7420.54]  So they're going to give it to me when they're done with it.
[7420.76 --> 7421.08]  16?
[7421.64 --> 7422.80]  Yeah, I'm going with 16 plus.
[7422.92 --> 7423.54]  You're going to run one?
[7424.08 --> 7424.20]  Yeah.
[7424.20 --> 7424.56]  Like Mayline?
[7424.68 --> 7424.88]  Oh yeah.
[7425.00 --> 7425.76]  You're going to put that away?
[7426.10 --> 7426.28]  Yeah.
[7426.34 --> 7426.52]  Yep.
[7426.92 --> 7427.18]  Wow.
[7427.32 --> 7427.82]  It's going away.
[7428.20 --> 7428.90]  It's going away.
[7429.90 --> 7430.78]  D Starfire.
[7430.86 --> 7433.04]  Actually, there's a couple of questions from floatplane chat from earlier.
[7433.52 --> 7438.54]  D Starfire asked, I've always wondered, what is LMG's stance on like the LTT GIFs and Discord
[7438.54 --> 7439.30]  and stuff like that?
[7439.66 --> 7440.94]  We don't mind that kind of thing.
[7441.00 --> 7444.68]  This was in response to the ghost keyboards situation.
[7444.68 --> 7449.30]  Oh, you're not marketing something with an endorsement with Linus.
[7449.34 --> 7449.56]  Yeah.
[7449.98 --> 7450.18]  Yeah.
[7450.22 --> 7454.46]  You're not creating a fake endorsement of a product that I explicitly said I don't think
[7454.46 --> 7455.10]  is a good value.
[7455.24 --> 7455.46]  Yeah.
[7455.64 --> 7457.24]  I think the GIFs are hilarious.
[7457.58 --> 7457.78]  Yeah.
[7458.14 --> 7458.90]  I...
[7458.90 --> 7465.18]  We are pro-community engagement and community use of our likenesses.
[7465.48 --> 7472.54]  Anytime some like meme face of me takes over the subreddit for a little while, it's
[7473.58 --> 7474.28]  great fun.
[7474.68 --> 7476.68]  Yeah.
[7478.44 --> 7480.26]  Toru Milkson asks, how's the cat?
[7480.34 --> 7483.50]  I realized after I said that the cat was at the vet, I never really gave an update.
[7483.60 --> 7484.32]  He's doing great.
[7485.10 --> 7487.46]  We don't know what exactly his deal was.
[7488.10 --> 7489.64]  He was favoring a leg a little bit.
[7489.72 --> 7493.74]  Maybe he just did something stupid because he's a dumb kitten and he got a little bit
[7493.74 --> 7498.46]  of inflammation, got a little bit of a fever and then they gave him...
[7498.46 --> 7502.72]  They just gave him an anti-inflammatory and painkillers and he was fine in like two days.
[7503.00 --> 7503.18]  Cool.
[7503.38 --> 7504.06]  So yeah, he's doing great.
[7504.68 --> 7504.92]  All right.
[7505.50 --> 7507.32]  What's up, Lee and Lee?
[7507.58 --> 7512.84]  I chimed in a while back asking Luke if he had played body cam and his opinions on it.
[7513.06 --> 7513.76]  Is there any updates?
[7513.82 --> 7516.84]  And if so, how does he feel about the camera movement and mechanics?
[7517.00 --> 7518.18]  Did I ever talk about it?
[7518.28 --> 7519.26]  I don't know if you ever did.
[7519.26 --> 7523.50]  There was a brief discussion about it when it sort of just first started.
[7523.50 --> 7526.08]  Yeah, I thought that might have been on the pre-show though or it might have been off camera.
[7526.08 --> 7529.26]  I remember talking about the laser scans and the details and things like that.
[7529.36 --> 7530.28]  But it might have been pre-show.
[7530.28 --> 7530.68]  Back to it.
[7530.68 --> 7531.86]  I hated it.
[7532.86 --> 7534.36]  Sorry to the body cam.
[7534.42 --> 7535.34]  Tell us how you really feel.
[7535.56 --> 7536.26]  Was it a scam?
[7538.08 --> 7538.44]  Yes.
[7538.56 --> 7539.14]  No, no, no, no.
[7539.14 --> 7542.32]  It has a really interesting aesthetic.
[7543.48 --> 7544.82]  They cooked.
[7545.14 --> 7546.66]  They did interesting things with it.
[7546.72 --> 7550.08]  But there was parts of the game that were just like, what?
[7550.08 --> 7557.38]  The gameplay that I was playing was like Seek and Destroy style where when you die, you're out until the next round, right?
[7557.80 --> 7560.54]  But you would then be able to pilot a drone.
[7561.44 --> 7566.14]  So you could just fly around the map almost noclip style because you have a drone.
[7566.54 --> 7567.70]  Find where they are.
[7567.90 --> 7571.80]  And then the in-game voice chat, you could tell your teammates where they were.
[7572.28 --> 7574.08]  Oh, well, that seems like an oversight.
[7574.20 --> 7574.94]  So stupid.
[7575.40 --> 7576.04]  That's a scam.
[7576.32 --> 7579.48]  So my team had one less player than their team.
[7580.08 --> 7584.52]  The KD ratios of everyone on our team was better than them in general.
[7584.52 --> 7589.20]  But we would just always lose because it would come down to a one, like, I don't know.
[7589.20 --> 7589.66]  Skill issue.
[7592.12 --> 7592.56]  Probably.
[7592.64 --> 7594.24]  I was pretty bad to be completely honest.
[7596.76 --> 7598.16]  I did not do well.
[7598.32 --> 7599.76]  But it was also super annoying.
[7599.90 --> 7604.20]  Like, you would actually get someone and you'd be stoked and then you'd hear the drone come around.
[7604.64 --> 7605.68]  And it's like, oh, okay.
[7606.36 --> 7607.18]  Guess I'm screwed.
[7607.78 --> 7608.04]  Nice.
[7608.04 --> 7611.96]  And you just, you hear the voice chatting drone telling them where you are.
[7612.10 --> 7612.44]  It's like.
[7613.64 --> 7616.28]  I Racer 6 says they will announce a scam shirt next week.
[7616.42 --> 7617.02]  Calling it now.
[7617.66 --> 7621.60]  You must have missed the part of the show where we said, we are going to do a scam shirt.
[7622.44 --> 7622.80]  Yeah.
[7623.64 --> 7624.00]  Yeah.
[7624.04 --> 7627.18]  And it like, it was, it was one of those games where they're like, it's realistic.
[7627.18 --> 7629.18]  So they just made it like feel horrible.
[7630.04 --> 7630.76]  Oh, sure.
[7630.76 --> 7634.56]  Like you're super clunky and like coming to a stop is really slow.
[7634.74 --> 7637.74]  And like, no, it's really not actually that slow.
[7637.84 --> 7638.98]  We don't have to play this way.
[7639.06 --> 7641.18]  People can turn on a dime pretty quickly.
[7641.42 --> 7641.64]  Yeah.
[7642.98 --> 7643.60]  I don't know.
[7643.68 --> 7646.04]  But it is the, you know, the aesthetics are really interesting.
[7646.20 --> 7647.40]  What they did with it is really interesting.
[7647.40 --> 7651.78]  Just, I did not enjoy the gameplay and I did not enjoy the gameplay mechanics.
[7651.78 --> 7653.96]  Like the whole drone thing and stuff that drove me nuts.
[7655.02 --> 7656.28]  So I bailed out.
[7656.64 --> 7657.64]  But yeah.
[7657.82 --> 7660.18]  I'm going to try to dump through some more Luke ones here.
[7660.30 --> 7662.04]  The reviews are in for our wallpaper app.
[7665.58 --> 7665.98]  Nice.
[7666.68 --> 7667.08]  Nice.
[7667.18 --> 7667.84]  That's pretty good.
[7667.84 --> 7667.96]  Thanks.
[7668.56 --> 7669.42]  Hi, Wansho.
[7669.50 --> 7670.36]  Question for Luke.
[7670.56 --> 7675.04]  What are your thoughts on companies asking employees to return to office such as Amazon?
[7678.70 --> 7680.36]  I'm glad I don't have to answer this.
[7680.88 --> 7682.26]  They just asked Luke.
[7683.68 --> 7684.74]  I don't know.
[7684.74 --> 7691.58]  I think, I think just like with pretty much any situation, a lot of it's going to come down to the management.
[7692.48 --> 7695.04]  I think there are people.
[7695.94 --> 7696.50]  I have.
[7696.50 --> 7699.14]  Can I talk vaguely enough about this?
[7699.20 --> 7699.70]  I think so.
[7700.40 --> 7710.00]  I have employed people that didn't work out because in my opinion, they weren't necessarily a bad worker, but they were not capable of work from home work.
[7711.52 --> 7717.26]  They, they were, you could, you could kind of tell they were not, you know, they weren't doing it.
[7717.40 --> 7718.50]  They probably needed more micromanagement.
[7719.30 --> 7720.66]  They probably needed more.
[7721.06 --> 7724.64]  Someone can literally see what they're doing all the time level micromanagement.
[7724.64 --> 7728.86]  Um, which you can't effectively do with work from home.
[7728.92 --> 7731.98]  This whole like monitor their mouse movement thing, whatever.
[7732.16 --> 7734.00]  You will always lose that war.
[7734.34 --> 7736.38]  And also just, can we not?
[7737.10 --> 7737.58]  Yeah.
[7737.86 --> 7738.36]  That too.
[7738.60 --> 7740.14]  But the companies are never going to win.
[7740.30 --> 7741.18]  So they, can we just not?
[7741.26 --> 7742.26]  They shouldn't even do it.
[7742.42 --> 7742.64]  Yeah.
[7742.64 --> 7746.06]  Because it's like invasive and weird and you're not going to win anyways.
[7746.12 --> 7747.32]  So just stop.
[7747.50 --> 7747.62]  Yeah.
[7747.90 --> 7754.60]  Um, but properly managed teams with good people that are going to be honest and do their work.
[7755.86 --> 7757.52]  Work from home versus work in office.
[7757.74 --> 7758.24]  I don't know.
[7758.26 --> 7758.80]  It doesn't really matter.
[7758.92 --> 7762.42]  At this point, I think it's like easier to manage people that are work from home.
[7762.54 --> 7764.38]  I think you navigated that really well.
[7764.38 --> 7769.88]  The tough thing is that I feel like in our super polarized world, I need a, I need a more
[7769.88 --> 7770.54]  aggressive take.
[7770.68 --> 7772.16]  No, no, no, no, no, it's not that.
[7772.24 --> 7773.32]  No, no, no.
[7773.32 --> 7777.08]  In our super polarized world, you're either with us or you're against us.
[7777.36 --> 7783.26]  And so I think for you to, I think that, you know, you would talk to like the Kevin O'Leary's
[7783.26 --> 7784.50]  of the world or whatever else.
[7784.50 --> 7789.58]  And if you say anything other than the employer has the absolute right to dictate when and
[7789.58 --> 7793.66]  where the worker works, then they'll be like, this is communism, you know?
[7793.70 --> 7795.24]  And to be clear, I don't know Kevin O'Leary.
[7795.38 --> 7799.26]  I don't know if he, I just, every time I, every time I read anything about his take on
[7799.26 --> 7801.18]  something, it's usually what I disagree with.
[7801.26 --> 7803.58]  So I just, so I'm just picking on him essentially.
[7803.58 --> 7806.74]  I don't know exactly what his take is on this, but I'd probably disagree with it.
[7806.84 --> 7811.58]  And then on the other side, you've got like r slash anti work that basically goes, I
[7811.58 --> 7818.30]  should work when I want, however I want, and if I want and whatever else.
[7819.02 --> 7825.94]  And, and there's sort of this, like, for you to have sort of a, a middle ground feels impossible.
[7826.02 --> 7833.84]  Like for you to say something like, you know, yeah, sometimes the employer, you know, abuses
[7833.84 --> 7835.28]  their, their power.
[7836.02 --> 7839.34]  You know, that's going to upset your, your, your capitalist fat cats.
[7839.34 --> 7845.72]  And for you to say, sometimes the worker is not in good faith, contributing positively
[7845.72 --> 7850.82]  to the success of the company that by the way, it pays their, you know, paychecks.
[7851.34 --> 7857.18]  Um, then the other crowd is going to be up in arms because no person could, would ever
[7857.18 --> 7857.60]  do that.
[7857.62 --> 7859.08]  So what you're saying is I just pissed off everybody.
[7859.50 --> 7859.74]  Yeah.
[7859.78 --> 7860.14]  Kind of.
[7860.24 --> 7860.40]  Nice.
[7860.72 --> 7861.04]  Nice.
[7861.16 --> 7861.48]  I don't know.
[7861.60 --> 7862.32]  Way to be a centrist.
[7862.32 --> 7862.80]  Yeah.
[7863.12 --> 7868.30]  I also have people literally on my team right now that I think I could objectively say just
[7868.30 --> 7869.74]  work better by working from home.
[7870.50 --> 7873.80]  More on task, if anything, like that, that type of stuff.
[7873.80 --> 7877.90]  Like there's just people are people and people are different.
[7878.06 --> 7878.70]  Oh, dude, this is great.
[7878.82 --> 7879.34]  People work.
[7879.58 --> 7883.86]  Floatplane chats lighting up with just like dumb shit that Kevin O'Leary has said.
[7883.86 --> 7888.52]  Oh, man.
[7889.38 --> 7890.14]  Oh, man.
[7890.46 --> 7892.80]  I don't even like, he was on Shark Tank, right?
[7893.80 --> 7894.10]  Yeah.
[7894.22 --> 7895.08]  The Canadian one.
[7895.42 --> 7895.78]  Oh, okay.
[7895.84 --> 7896.00]  Yeah.
[7896.08 --> 7897.14]  The like, you know.
[7897.24 --> 7897.86]  Whale tank.
[7898.10 --> 7899.04]  I don't know what it's called.
[7902.18 --> 7903.00]  Salmon tank.
[7903.20 --> 7903.56]  Anyway.
[7903.58 --> 7904.02]  Paper Dan.
[7904.22 --> 7904.60]  Anyway.
[7904.60 --> 7904.90]  Yeah.
[7905.02 --> 7910.90]  The reality of it is, is there are good faith and bad faith bosses and there are good
[7910.90 --> 7912.54]  faith and bad faith employees.
[7912.92 --> 7913.02]  Yeah.
[7913.02 --> 7920.28]  And any kind of blanket, this and only this is the interpretation of the situation is
[7920.28 --> 7921.10]  wrong.
[7921.42 --> 7921.64]  Yeah.
[7922.04 --> 7922.34]  Period.
[7922.76 --> 7922.98]  Yep.
[7923.60 --> 7925.14]  It's a different type of management.
[7925.58 --> 7930.52]  It also takes a, sometimes, not always, but sometimes it takes kind of a different type
[7930.52 --> 7931.02]  of employee.
[7931.90 --> 7932.42]  Yep.
[7932.42 --> 7934.06]  I think it can be beneficial for some people.
[7934.14 --> 7935.46]  I think it'd be negative for other people.
[7935.62 --> 7941.24]  I think sometimes if it is negative for that person, they might be willing to make certain
[7941.24 --> 7942.54]  compromises to make it work.
[7942.54 --> 7946.54]  If it like saves them a bunch of money or if it saves a bunch of time or whatever else.
[7946.54 --> 7949.94]  I've also found that if it's negative for people, they tend to be the kinds of people
[7949.94 --> 7952.88]  that lack the self-awareness to recognize that it's negative for them.
[7952.88 --> 7955.82]  That is almost certainly also a thing.
[7956.64 --> 7958.74]  I think that's also on both sides though.
[7958.74 --> 7965.88]  I think sometimes when, if managers can't figure out how to manage remote employees, they will
[7965.88 --> 7967.92]  just say, Oh, this system doesn't work.
[7968.00 --> 7968.80]  It's easy to blame.
[7968.80 --> 7972.88]  All these people are bad and I'm good and no one else, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[7972.88 --> 7979.94]  When realistically, it's just, it's a, you know, if you are on a remote team and you
[7979.94 --> 7982.84]  like it, try to do good by it.
[7982.84 --> 7987.26]  If you want it to stay existing, because there is a bit of a war on this stuff going on right
[7987.26 --> 7987.38]  now.
[7987.38 --> 7992.68]  And I think being unrealistic about its potential downsides is not going to help.
[7992.68 --> 7997.10]  Um, and I also think that there is, there's bad faith arguments on both sides, you know?
[7997.30 --> 7997.70]  Absolutely.
[7998.18 --> 7999.02]  Yeah, it is what it is.
[8000.60 --> 8001.68]  How about some more Luke ones?
[8001.88 --> 8002.26]  Hi, Luke.
[8002.32 --> 8005.20]  As an avid active curler from California.
[8005.36 --> 8005.58]  Sick.
[8005.80 --> 8006.94]  Yes, we curl in California.
[8007.08 --> 8007.60]  In California?
[8007.84 --> 8008.06]  Yeah.
[8008.22 --> 8009.24]  You had me in, yeah.
[8009.84 --> 8010.76]  Not going to lie.
[8010.86 --> 8012.04]  They had us in the first half.
[8012.30 --> 8015.88]  Do you have other recreational sports or is that it?
[8016.32 --> 8019.78]  Uh, my question is lead, second, vice or skip.
[8020.30 --> 8022.20]  Which one are you usually playing?
[8022.20 --> 8024.10]  Also, do you prefer draws or hits?
[8025.32 --> 8027.60]  Oh, generally, uh, hits.
[8027.78 --> 8028.82]  No idea what we're talking about.
[8029.00 --> 8029.32]  Hits?
[8029.86 --> 8031.48]  Are you a curler from California?
[8032.62 --> 8034.34]  I only hear them called takeouts.
[8034.74 --> 8036.80]  Um, I'm probably wrong.
[8036.88 --> 8037.40]  They're probably right.
[8037.74 --> 8040.98]  Um, I bet you a hit is when it, anyways, don't worry.
[8041.00 --> 8041.38]  It doesn't matter.
[8041.68 --> 8044.08]  Uh, I, I believe I'm usually second.
[8044.22 --> 8048.76]  My dad is always the skip and I don't foresee myself ever playing curling if it's not with
[8048.76 --> 8049.24]  my dad.
[8049.30 --> 8050.88]  So I will not be that role.
[8050.88 --> 8051.92]  Um, nice.
[8052.20 --> 8053.76]  Usually my brother's the lead.
[8053.88 --> 8054.46]  I'm second.
[8054.80 --> 8059.58]  My uncle or someone else playing, depending on if my uncle can make it or not, is third.
[8059.72 --> 8060.62]  And then my dad is skip.
[8062.26 --> 8062.64]  Yeah.
[8062.76 --> 8065.24]  It's basically just the order that you throw the rocks in.
[8065.70 --> 8066.24]  No, I know.
[8066.40 --> 8067.44]  First, second, and third.
[8067.44 --> 8067.72]  I've curled.
[8068.24 --> 8069.10]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8069.64 --> 8070.08]  What'd you say?
[8070.26 --> 8071.52]  First, second, and third.
[8071.72 --> 8073.02]  And then skip is just last.
[8073.14 --> 8075.58]  But it's essentially like the team captain of sorts.
[8075.86 --> 8076.22]  I'm sorry.
[8076.22 --> 8079.78]  I was just, I was a little thrown off because you like kept forgetting your dad's name.
[8080.38 --> 8080.82]  What?
[8081.02 --> 8081.54]  It's Rob.
[8082.18 --> 8083.08]  It's not skip.
[8083.42 --> 8083.62]  What?
[8084.42 --> 8086.00]  No, I'm just, I know the positions.
[8086.22 --> 8086.26]  Okay.
[8087.14 --> 8087.96]  I'm just bugging him.
[8088.26 --> 8089.08]  That's my uncle.
[8090.38 --> 8090.78]  Oh.
[8090.78 --> 8094.58]  Oh, that's actually pretty funny.
[8094.68 --> 8094.96]  Terrible.
[8095.34 --> 8097.62]  But no, it's not even just the throwing order.
[8097.68 --> 8100.38]  Each one of them has like slightly different roles and responsibilities.
[8101.14 --> 8103.12]  Anyways, most of it lays on the scale.
[8103.12 --> 8105.64]  And that I don't know anything about because I've only ever done it once.
[8105.88 --> 8106.08]  Yeah.
[8106.34 --> 8106.70]  All right.
[8107.56 --> 8108.94]  Okay, back up to the top.
[8108.94 --> 8109.82]  Hi, DLL.
[8110.00 --> 8114.44]  Notice the new ad insert tests compared to the normal ones on recent videos.
[8114.64 --> 8115.80]  Can you talk about these?
[8116.10 --> 8117.38]  How are they doing?
[8117.52 --> 8118.36]  Any learnings?
[8118.52 --> 8120.48]  Enjoying the change up personally?
[8120.78 --> 8125.74]  I got to tell you guys, I'm as surprised as you to see some of them.
[8126.06 --> 8131.20]  The one where my son gets swapped out with Dennis was a little jarring.
[8131.90 --> 8133.32]  Oh, I did see that.
[8133.32 --> 8136.62]  That was not in the version of the video that I reviewed.
[8137.94 --> 8140.72]  Normally, I'm the final pass review on LTT videos.
[8140.82 --> 8142.26]  I did not see that.
[8143.00 --> 8144.52]  I thought it was really funny.
[8144.68 --> 8145.20]  It was funny.
[8145.28 --> 8145.46]  Yeah.
[8145.46 --> 8145.90]  Yeah.
[8148.06 --> 8148.38]  Yeah.
[8148.50 --> 8152.34]  I think we're just, we're trying to, we're trying to have fun with it a little bit.
[8152.34 --> 8154.22]  Like we used to do more of that kind of stuff.
[8154.22 --> 8156.50]  And then we just got kind of formulaic.
[8156.50 --> 8162.22]  And that's Dennis's job now is to make our, make our sponsorship spots as engaging as our content.
[8162.34 --> 8165.88]  I think he's, um, sorry, excuse me.
[8165.92 --> 8168.94]  I think he's doing a really good job in terms of making it more engaging.
[8168.94 --> 8174.58]  I think that the team is still kind of working on, you know, what KPIs look like for sponsors
[8174.58 --> 8176.50]  to, to drive more revenue from it.
[8176.58 --> 8180.34]  But if nothing else, if we're entertaining you guys, then we consider it a good investment.
[8180.34 --> 8180.78]  I think.
[8180.94 --> 8181.18]  Yeah.
[8181.46 --> 8183.58]  Um, it doesn't all fall into my department.
[8183.58 --> 8187.56]  Now you got to understand that everything that I say now, uh, comes from the perspective
[8187.56 --> 8193.58]  of a member of the upper management, but not the one who makes, even when he doesn't show
[8193.58 --> 8195.92]  up to upper management meetings, not the one who makes all the decisions.
[8195.92 --> 8196.84]  I show up sometimes.
[8197.04 --> 8197.48]  Sometimes.
[8197.48 --> 8197.84]  Yeah.
[8197.96 --> 8198.76]  And I get summaries.
[8199.68 --> 8204.56]  You can, I told, I told you, I told you, you can always like,
[8204.58 --> 8208.08]  like call me in if you need, you know, backup on something or whatever.
[8208.18 --> 8208.74]  I told you that.
[8208.82 --> 8210.02]  It's not even necessarily that.
[8210.12 --> 8214.22]  I think your general input on things would be good though.
[8214.38 --> 8217.44]  Well, and you can always table something for a future discussion.
[8217.44 --> 8222.56]  If you're just like, yeah, I've known Linus for 1000 years and I feel very strongly that
[8222.56 --> 8227.42]  as the investor, primary shareholder of the company, he would think this is phenomenally
[8227.42 --> 8227.78]  stupid.
[8228.12 --> 8229.56]  Like we can always have conversations.
[8229.70 --> 8230.56]  Nothing's set in stone.
[8230.72 --> 8233.76]  We, we make it, we try to make decisions as a team.
[8233.76 --> 8236.98]  Um, and I do think we do a pretty good job.
[8237.06 --> 8240.98]  I just think sometimes it's surprising the amount of times that the discussion goes to
[8240.98 --> 8243.70]  what would Linus think?
[8243.98 --> 8248.42]  And it's like, wow, this would be insanely more efficient if he was here and said what
[8248.42 --> 8249.14]  he was thinking.
[8249.68 --> 8250.46]  Um, okay.
[8250.46 --> 8252.74]  But I got like videos to shoot.
[8252.84 --> 8256.80]  I know the challenge is like, if all I had to do was be an executive, I could, I could
[8256.80 --> 8258.24]  probably do a pretty good job of it.
[8258.42 --> 8259.30]  I'd be bored as hell.
[8259.30 --> 8262.16]  I, I struggled to stay on task in that way.
[8262.22 --> 8266.38]  I like creating reports and it's a weird world reviewing reports.
[8266.38 --> 8267.38]  Like I can kind of do it.
[8267.38 --> 8269.70]  Like I can hyper-focus and I can like power through it.
[8269.96 --> 8273.58]  I don't know if you probably got a bunch of emails from me like one morning.
[8273.76 --> 8274.06]  Yeah.
[8274.32 --> 8274.62]  Yeah.
[8274.96 --> 8276.16]  I, I, I understand.
[8276.38 --> 8282.40]  This doesn't even, I went through like 300 unreads in my inbox and just like powered
[8282.40 --> 8283.30]  through it on a flight.
[8283.30 --> 8287.22]  And like, that's the kind of thing I can do, but I'm, I'm more of a, I'm a sprinter.
[8287.36 --> 8288.50]  I'm not a marathon runner.
[8289.14 --> 8291.60]  And, um, and I'm just like, I, I don't know.
[8291.62 --> 8294.28]  I just, I get pulled in all these different directions and I, I enable it.
[8294.70 --> 8300.62]  My behavior enables the way that people pull me into side conversations and like, like talk
[8300.62 --> 8301.32]  to me about things.
[8301.42 --> 8303.76]  So I guess what I'm saying is I'm more than happy to do that.
[8303.98 --> 8304.30]  Yeah.
[8304.84 --> 8308.54]  But, um, yeah, I, I won't be in exec meeting every time.
[8308.54 --> 8314.78]  Um, anyway, the point is, um, yeah, I'm a member of the exec team, but everything that
[8314.78 --> 8317.12]  I say is a perspective of mine now.
[8317.22 --> 8320.42]  It's not just what the company is doing.
[8320.62 --> 8322.06]  I am not the CEO.
[8322.46 --> 8324.32]  The company's big and there's a lot of execs.
[8324.44 --> 8330.50]  And I, I had a conversation with Taryn yesterday that was basically like, he was like, uh, you
[8330.50 --> 8331.56]  know, yeah.
[8331.92 --> 8333.86]  Uh, you know, are we, are we doing this?
[8333.88 --> 8335.76]  It was like something that he wants to do that.
[8335.76 --> 8340.54]  I was kind of lukewarm on and I was like, well, you said we're doing it.
[8341.30 --> 8342.46]  So we're doing it.
[8342.46 --> 8344.68]  Like, and I was kind of, I was kind of joking with him.
[8344.68 --> 8349.26]  I was like, you know, if I, if, if I give you the title, it's not a title, it's, it's
[8349.26 --> 8349.92]  a responsibility.
[8350.44 --> 8358.00]  And so, you know, um, as long as you have the title until such time as you are fired,
[8358.46 --> 8364.30]  um, you have my sword, you know, like, do you, do you ask shareholders?
[8364.30 --> 8366.98]  Do you have the board of directors permission to do things?
[8367.30 --> 8372.16]  You, it would be more the board of directors, but the board of directors would often represent
[8372.16 --> 8373.52]  the interests of the shareholders.
[8374.20 --> 8378.16]  Theoretically, everyone is sort of representing the interests of the shareholders, but members
[8378.16 --> 8382.94]  of the board of directors, especially in smaller companies like ours are often the shareholders.
[8383.16 --> 8384.76]  People are tagging me and they're just saying warm.
[8386.34 --> 8386.70]  Nice.
[8386.70 --> 8390.28]  Um, yeah.
[8390.34 --> 8393.06]  Cause I, I mean, I think it's, I think it's still in, in Taryn's defense.
[8393.06 --> 8396.84]  I think it's still valid to ask the shareholders what they want.
[8397.00 --> 8397.66]  Yeah, absolutely.
[8397.80 --> 8398.30]  No, it is.
[8398.34 --> 8399.40]  It is a hundred percent.
[8399.50 --> 8399.64]  Yeah.
[8399.72 --> 8399.82]  Yeah.
[8400.02 --> 8406.90]  And, and, and, and for me, my role is not to micromanage that it's to set the direction.
[8406.90 --> 8412.02]  And, you know, if there's a particular, let's say a personnel decision, or if there's a,
[8412.02 --> 8416.98]  like a, like an investment decision, um, like if there's some, some kind of action.
[8417.20 --> 8420.88]  I just think in both of those, him going to, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in defend Taryn mode now.
[8421.06 --> 8422.84]  Um, he's doing great in both of those.
[8422.92 --> 8424.50]  I'm not saying you're saying he's not doing great.
[8424.50 --> 8432.66]  I just, in both of those situations, um, vision man makes sense to consult in both of the things
[8432.66 --> 8433.44]  that you just described.
[8433.68 --> 8440.86]  And depending on the impact, severity, et cetera, of those things, consulting shareholders might
[8440.86 --> 8441.52]  also make sense.
[8441.66 --> 8441.76]  Sure.
[8441.96 --> 8449.58]  But what I'm trying to say is that what I will probably say is here's your rope, which is
[8449.58 --> 8449.76]  fair.
[8449.92 --> 8453.58]  Use it to go as far as you can or use it to hang yourself.
[8454.50 --> 8455.94]  Well, it's an expression.
[8459.70 --> 8460.34]  Fair enough.
[8460.54 --> 8460.68]  Right.
[8460.74 --> 8461.72]  Cause that, that's the way it is.
[8461.78 --> 8463.48]  That's what, that's what leadership is.
[8463.72 --> 8468.72]  You either, you have to be given the leeway to successfully lead until such time as you
[8468.72 --> 8471.48]  lose the confidence of the board of directors and then you're fired.
[8471.86 --> 8472.26]  Right.
[8472.28 --> 8474.66]  Like, cause it's the top, it's the top position in the company.
[8474.70 --> 8475.46]  It's realistic.
[8475.46 --> 8480.30]  So you either are capable of leading or you've lost, or you've lost confidence and you're done.
[8481.22 --> 8481.44]  Right.
[8481.46 --> 8484.48]  Like there's no real, like, it's not like I can be like, oh, well, why don't we
[8484.48 --> 8487.42]  demote you to VP of happiness or whatever?
[8487.58 --> 8487.72]  Right.
[8487.78 --> 8490.56]  Like, that's not how that works.
[8490.56 --> 8491.88]  When someone is brought in to lead.
[8492.04 --> 8494.88]  I feel like that is a role that some company has somewhere.
[8495.02 --> 8499.18]  I mean, probably, but I don't think Taryn would be the one to occupy it.
[8500.34 --> 8502.22]  That guy has the worst resting face.
[8502.22 --> 8504.58]  It's, it's pretty bad.
[8504.82 --> 8505.96]  I'm used to it at this point.
[8506.02 --> 8506.94]  It doesn't faze me anymore.
[8507.06 --> 8507.26]  Yeah.
[8507.48 --> 8511.74]  And to be clear, I'm not saying anything about him that I haven't told him to his face multiple
[8511.74 --> 8512.36]  times.
[8512.48 --> 8512.78]  Yeah.
[8513.06 --> 8513.24]  Yeah.
[8513.30 --> 8515.50]  He told me like almost immediately.
[8515.62 --> 8516.86]  He told you that?
[8516.96 --> 8517.22]  That's great.
[8517.22 --> 8518.64]  I suspect he probably, yeah.
[8518.74 --> 8521.28]  I was going to say it was incredibly important for him to say that.
[8521.28 --> 8523.64]  Otherwise I would have been crying every time I talked to him.
[8524.98 --> 8525.38]  No.
[8525.56 --> 8526.52]  You get used to it.
[8526.66 --> 8527.10]  It's super.
[8527.46 --> 8530.42]  If I know and everybody's like, no, he's just like this.
[8530.48 --> 8531.14]  Then it's like, okay.
[8531.28 --> 8531.46]  Yeah.
[8531.56 --> 8533.10]  I can, I can, I can handle that.
[8533.20 --> 8533.46]  That's fine.
[8533.48 --> 8534.48]  He's just like this.
[8535.92 --> 8536.60]  By the way.
[8536.64 --> 8537.06]  That's great.
[8537.46 --> 8538.14]  Oh, what now?
[8538.38 --> 8540.06]  What is a chief happiness officer?
[8540.32 --> 8541.12]  Oh my goodness.
[8541.22 --> 8541.42]  Yeah.
[8541.44 --> 8543.36]  You can't have a chief happiness officer without.
[8543.70 --> 8548.36]  That is the most dystopian term I have ever heard in my entire life.
[8548.36 --> 8551.22]  Beatings will continue until morale improves.
[8552.88 --> 8554.50]  All right.
[8555.14 --> 8558.36]  Top performers get an additional one minute break.
[8560.16 --> 8565.92]  Dear Linus, if ad block is piracy, but closing your eyes isn't, then what is your opinion
[8565.92 --> 8569.28]  on a robot that detects ads and puts a blindfold over your face until it's over?
[8569.78 --> 8570.86]  Kind of joking, but also curious.
[8571.08 --> 8573.26]  I'm going to ask, have either of you seen Black Mirror?
[8574.12 --> 8574.72]  I should.
[8574.90 --> 8576.04]  I've only seen bits and pieces.
[8576.04 --> 8577.84]  First season, 15 million merits.
[8577.84 --> 8579.76]  There is actually this.
[8580.26 --> 8583.58]  They're forced to watch advertisements or they can pay to make them stop.
[8584.22 --> 8590.26]  And if you cover your eyes, a rising tone gets louder and louder and louder.
[8590.26 --> 8593.48]  And it says, resume viewing, resume viewing.
[8593.84 --> 8595.84]  And you have to watch it.
[8596.40 --> 8597.74]  Just in order to.
[8598.72 --> 8599.46]  You know what I think?
[8599.62 --> 8600.86]  I think it's a scam.
[8601.38 --> 8601.66]  Yep.
[8602.20 --> 8602.64]  Scam.
[8603.04 --> 8603.28]  Yep.
[8603.64 --> 8603.90]  Okay.
[8603.90 --> 8605.20]  I'm going to give you a serious answer.
[8605.58 --> 8606.60]  It's the automation.
[8606.60 --> 8610.22]  It's the automation that makes it that.
[8611.72 --> 8616.52]  So anything you do, anything you do manually and then resume manually that requires your
[8616.52 --> 8618.24]  attention because that's essentially the payment.
[8618.32 --> 8619.18]  The payment is attention.
[8619.60 --> 8620.74]  It can be attention on the ad.
[8621.02 --> 8623.34]  It can be attending to not paying attention to the ad.
[8623.34 --> 8624.98]  But I don't look at ads.
[8625.66 --> 8627.54]  I mean, we've talked about this extensively.
[8628.30 --> 8634.92]  Like I actually, it is a matter of personal pride that I do not like to be influenced by
[8634.92 --> 8635.16]  ads.
[8635.36 --> 8636.74]  Occasionally, I'll click on stuff.
[8637.60 --> 8638.66]  Very, very occasionally.
[8638.76 --> 8640.54]  But I don't like doing it.
[8640.54 --> 8645.06]  And I will actually go out of my way to just like avert my eyes for nine seconds and then
[8645.06 --> 8645.86]  like check back in.
[8646.22 --> 8647.72]  But attention is the form of payment.
[8647.84 --> 8650.90]  So you're either paying attention to when it's over or you're paying attention to it
[8650.90 --> 8652.76]  playing through.
[8652.76 --> 8656.60]  And anyway, it's not piracy.
[8656.72 --> 8657.26]  It's privateering.
[8657.94 --> 8658.74]  We've been through this.
[8659.12 --> 8659.28]  Yeah.
[8659.64 --> 8659.92]  Yeah.
[8661.98 --> 8662.78]  Interesting take.
[8663.58 --> 8667.82]  Hey, Linus, Luke and Dan, during a fresh Windows install Windows update downloaded and
[8667.82 --> 8669.40]  flashed my bias on restart.
[8669.58 --> 8673.36]  Is there an end in sight for the amount of power Microsoft is taking lately?
[8673.42 --> 8673.90]  Actually, hold on.
[8673.92 --> 8675.54]  I want to go back to the other thing for a second.
[8675.64 --> 8679.38]  It's also it's also down to like I'm not condemning anything.
[8679.38 --> 8682.20]  Whatever you're comfortable with, you just do your thing there.
[8682.90 --> 8684.82]  OK, is there an entity to be fair?
[8686.32 --> 8691.54]  Actually, the bios flashing thing, I believe that's more down to the system integrator like
[8691.54 --> 8693.12]  that would never happen with a custom machine.
[8693.26 --> 8695.20]  So I don't think this is really Windows.
[8695.98 --> 8701.34]  This is more Windows update having a functionality that the system integrator is choosing to make
[8701.34 --> 8706.18]  use of as opposed to Microsoft seizing power.
[8706.18 --> 8709.78]  There's plenty of Microsoft abusing power lately that we could point at.
[8709.86 --> 8710.80]  I don't think this is it.
[8712.72 --> 8713.40]  All right.
[8715.06 --> 8717.02]  OK, what else?
[8717.26 --> 8718.88]  I got to make sure that that is broadcast.
[8719.64 --> 8724.64]  Since LMG has such a wide array of different jobs, how does growing in your own field look
[8724.64 --> 8729.06]  like, for example, graphic designer, particularly with the continual growth of the company?
[8729.36 --> 8734.56]  Like a lot of small slash medium, I think technically we still qualify as small by a lot
[8734.56 --> 8735.06]  of definitions.
[8736.24 --> 8742.36]  Like a lot of small companies, we struggle with this because and we've had to, in some
[8742.36 --> 8748.28]  cases, create sort of I don't want to call them artificial because they are reflective
[8748.28 --> 8753.66]  of the increased experience and or compensation that is associated with them.
[8753.66 --> 8760.02]  But we've had to kind of create new segmentations sometimes within roles that previously would
[8760.02 --> 8760.58]  have been the same.
[8760.58 --> 8761.76]  So we previously had writer.
[8762.24 --> 8763.80]  Now we have junior writer and senior writer.
[8764.40 --> 8769.56]  In order to take you could take a piece from like Silicon Valley tech stuff where you have
[8769.56 --> 8771.26]  like numbered levels.
[8771.76 --> 8771.90]  Yeah.
[8772.08 --> 8772.28]  Yeah.
[8772.36 --> 8772.94]  Something like that.
[8773.20 --> 8773.36]  Three.
[8773.54 --> 8776.80]  That would be one good thing that could come from Silicon Valley tech.
[8779.22 --> 8782.22]  I'm sure it's misused for horrible reasons somehow.
[8782.48 --> 8787.56]  It's absolutely something that we have looked at a little bit and it's absolutely something that
[8787.56 --> 8789.98]  we haven't looked at enough and haven't solved.
[8793.32 --> 8797.64]  Linus, I remember you saying you had to go to Saskatoon to get your tie can.
[8797.84 --> 8801.36]  How did you like your visit to our flat chunk of dirt?
[8801.74 --> 8803.46]  I did not say that.
[8804.22 --> 8807.62]  This kind of thing, this kind of thing happens a lot.
[8807.76 --> 8812.26]  I read a lot of things that I apparently said that I definitely never said and definitely
[8812.26 --> 8812.92]  never happened.
[8812.92 --> 8815.40]  I imported it from Quebec.
[8816.12 --> 8817.00]  So you're close.
[8818.52 --> 8821.84]  Just got the province wrong and you got who went where wrong.
[8822.70 --> 8826.16]  However, conveniently, I have been to Saskatchewan.
[8826.70 --> 8828.82]  I think I drove through Regina though.
[8829.06 --> 8832.18]  Which one does the one road go through?
[8833.98 --> 8835.94]  It was a long time ago.
[8836.06 --> 8840.30]  I was 16 years of age, but I did drive through the prairies.
[8840.30 --> 8844.54]  I didn't really think they were as flat as people make them out to be.
[8845.30 --> 8845.52]  Yeah.
[8845.54 --> 8846.24]  I went through Regina.
[8846.38 --> 8847.62]  I did not go through Saskatoon.
[8847.76 --> 8849.88]  That was, oh boy, would that ever have been a long way out of the way.
[8851.94 --> 8852.26]  Yeah.
[8852.30 --> 8855.50]  I mean, they were like, they were flat, but I just, the way people talk about it, it's
[8855.50 --> 8858.12]  like, yeah, you could see for like a thousand miles in every dirt.
[8858.20 --> 8861.02]  I mean, like, yeah, it's sort of like there's rolling hills and stuff.
[8861.02 --> 8866.36]  At least, at least in the, the, the bottom part of Saskatchewan that I drove through.
[8867.60 --> 8871.22]  Regina, you guys, Regina, it's a city.
[8871.50 --> 8872.16]  Calm down.
[8872.28 --> 8873.32]  I knew it was going to happen immediately.
[8874.98 --> 8875.42]  Immediately.
[8875.86 --> 8877.16]  All Canadians giggle too.
[8877.38 --> 8877.96]  Good job, chat.
[8878.52 --> 8879.56]  Question to Linus.
[8879.60 --> 8883.40]  Is there any other tech or house dream upgrades you want to make?
[8883.56 --> 8884.78]  Thanks for all the amazing content.
[8885.34 --> 8887.00]  Um, I don't know.
[8887.02 --> 8888.46]  It's all like kind of awesome.
[8889.28 --> 8892.48]  I'm getting pretty stoked on something we're going to be working on.
[8892.76 --> 8893.52]  I forget.
[8894.02 --> 8895.48]  Um, no, not us.
[8895.62 --> 8896.12]  Oh, cool.
[8896.22 --> 8900.04]  Uh, we, as in myself and Emma, um, my roommate is gone.
[8900.32 --> 8900.72]  Yeah.
[8900.88 --> 8902.64]  Birds were sick, which sucked.
[8902.74 --> 8903.74]  They were gone for a long time.
[8903.76 --> 8909.48]  It was very expensive, but that let us, you know, get crazy chemical carpet cleaners in
[8909.48 --> 8911.16]  there and just really like clean things up.
[8911.70 --> 8914.14]  Um, not a great review of your former roommate.
[8914.78 --> 8915.94]  For the whole house.
[8916.12 --> 8917.24]  In his defense.
[8917.40 --> 8917.74]  I'm just playing.
[8917.74 --> 8922.06]  It was pretty bad, but we did do it for the whole house.
[8922.52 --> 8926.78]  Um, and we're going to be moving all the like computers and stuff.
[8926.86 --> 8927.22]  Oh, sick.
[8927.62 --> 8929.62]  And we're already kind of planning out.
[8929.80 --> 8935.50]  There's still more things to plan out, but you know, um, both desks against one wall with
[8935.50 --> 8938.14]  like a little Island in the middle for where the birds are going to go and stuff.
[8938.14 --> 8940.00]  It's going to be, it's going to be pretty cool.
[8940.12 --> 8940.50]  Sick.
[8940.76 --> 8941.32]  It's going to be cool.
[8941.32 --> 8946.20]  I can't really think of any, uh, any tech upgrades that I need to make right now.
[8946.28 --> 8948.52]  My, my tech setup at my house is like kind of.
[8949.00 --> 8950.02]  Oh, and that's awesome.
[8950.26 --> 8951.44]  No, I won't go into it.
[8951.68 --> 8952.18]  Oh, okay.
[8953.40 --> 8954.24]  Now I'm curious.
[8954.24 --> 8960.68]  Uh, it's, it doesn't really matter, but what go away.
[8960.92 --> 8961.36]  Okay.
[8961.42 --> 8961.62]  Sorry.
[8962.04 --> 8967.94]  Uh, does stopping a long form YouTube video and finishing it later or the next day negatively
[8967.94 --> 8969.08]  affect the creator?
[8969.20 --> 8970.66]  I can't answer for sure.
[8970.66 --> 8974.82]  But what I can say is that probably that would actually be a positive signal.
[8974.82 --> 8981.90]  Uh, we have videos that have extremely low retention, but extremely long, uh, strong performance
[8981.90 --> 8982.70]  over time.
[8983.52 --> 8989.18]  Um, here, let me see if I can just, uh, what is happening right now?
[8989.18 --> 8992.32]  Google analytics is a weird or YouTube analytics is a weird.
[8992.82 --> 8993.22]  Yeah.
[8993.34 --> 8995.18]  So here, magic here, check this out.
[8995.90 --> 8999.54]  Um, I'm just going to share my screen real quick here.
[8999.54 --> 9001.98]  So how to build a PC, the last guide you'll ever need.
[9002.04 --> 9003.52]  Let's, let's look at the original one.
[9006.78 --> 9010.84]  This retention graph is absolute poo poo.
[9011.22 --> 9016.74]  Like by the end of this video, only 16% of people are watching this video.
[9016.92 --> 9023.00]  And yet this got served for a whopping 12 million views on the platform.
[9023.16 --> 9024.76]  So like for context here.
[9024.80 --> 9025.00]  Okay.
[9025.02 --> 9029.18]  Let's take something, um, let's take something more recent.
[9029.30 --> 9029.42]  Okay.
[9029.42 --> 9031.72]  Can you have too many wifi routers?
[9032.10 --> 9035.34]  Obviously it's a much shorter video, but you can, you can clearly see here.
[9035.44 --> 9039.48]  We're looking at more like by the time the end sponsorship spot, 45%.
[9039.48 --> 9041.34]  It's above typical retention, right?
[9041.38 --> 9044.96]  By the time we reach the end, I don't know, 1.3 million views.
[9045.04 --> 9047.70]  Let's not, let's not, let's not serve that as much.
[9048.08 --> 9053.02]  Uh, YouTube home down YouTube recommendations down.
[9053.58 --> 9055.04]  Uh, why would that be?
[9055.40 --> 9058.92]  Because the first video I showed you guys is reference material.
[9058.92 --> 9062.50]  The overall watch time is huge because it's like two hours long.
[9062.50 --> 9067.62]  So that 16% or whatever it was at the end amounts to longer watch time.
[9067.72 --> 9068.88]  And YouTube wants you on the platform.
[9068.98 --> 9070.54]  The other thing is that people look at it.
[9070.76 --> 9074.66]  They go, well, that's nice, but I'm not building a computer right now.
[9074.66 --> 9078.76]  And then they come back when it is time to build a computer.
[9079.20 --> 9081.20]  That is a very strong signal.
[9081.20 --> 9086.20]  So you just have to think about what kind of signal your behavior is sending algorithmically.
[9086.50 --> 9089.16]  Looking at something going, I don't have time for this right now.
[9089.16 --> 9096.40]  And going out of your way, going out of your way to take part of your day and search for it and go back to it and finish it.
[9096.40 --> 9099.80]  That is a very strong signal that you were quite engaged by that content.
[9100.00 --> 9102.26]  So I would say it's a very good thing, actually.
[9102.58 --> 9103.72]  Don't, don't like do that.
[9103.78 --> 9108.48]  Don't just like start videos and then like, like go back on purpose to go watch them or whatever.
[9108.56 --> 9112.62]  Just, just, you know, use the platform and it should theoretically tune itself for you.
[9112.62 --> 9112.98]  Yeah.
[9113.52 --> 9117.90]  Hey Linus, now that you are switching to iPhone, will you also be trying the Apple ecosystem?
[9118.26 --> 9119.98]  Watch, macOS, maybe HomeKit.
[9120.28 --> 9122.68]  I don't really have any need to switch to macOS right now.
[9122.76 --> 9127.64]  And besides, I think my perspective with iPhones was always using an iPhone as a Windows guy.
[9128.00 --> 9130.66]  And that will continue to be my perspective, I think.
[9131.46 --> 9136.08]  DLL currently working for a tech startup in a decision-making position and my team is scaling quickly.
[9136.52 --> 9140.22]  What methods have you used to evaluate if you're making the right decisions for growth?
[9140.22 --> 9142.96]  These are hard questions.
[9143.18 --> 9143.64]  Yeah, it's hard.
[9143.74 --> 9146.84]  I mean, realistically, you could take an entire degree of that.
[9147.16 --> 9147.34]  Yeah.
[9147.56 --> 9147.96]  So.
[9148.18 --> 9149.88]  And you'd still barely know what you're doing.
[9150.34 --> 9150.64]  Yeah.
[9152.66 --> 9157.62]  Find data you can trust at least a bit and then try to be guided.
[9158.06 --> 9162.62]  Also, as much as I'm not a fan of the guy, Bezos has an interesting quote on data stuff
[9162.62 --> 9166.06]  that I've been trying to push around a little bit lately as we're, as we're getting more and more data driven.
[9167.50 --> 9170.00]  That the, it's very easy for data to lie.
[9170.22 --> 9173.58]  It's also very easy for you to misinterpret what the data really means.
[9173.78 --> 9179.66]  So if the sentiment and the, it's really good to capture data and to read it and try to figure out what's going on.
[9179.66 --> 9186.02]  But if the sentiment and the data notably don't match, try to figure out what's going on.
[9186.10 --> 9188.72]  But generally you should strongly consider the sentiment.
[9189.22 --> 9190.46]  It says something along that line.
[9190.52 --> 9191.26]  So I don't remember what it is.
[9191.26 --> 9199.86]  How have power tool companies been given a pass for so long for locking consumers into their ecosystems with batteries?
[9200.02 --> 9203.72]  While companies like Apple or Google are criticized for being anti-consumer.
[9203.72 --> 9212.86]  Because, uh, it's a different, less, um, okay.
[9213.66 --> 9216.38]  First of all, if you talk to any trades, they hate that.
[9216.92 --> 9217.74]  Drives them crazy.
[9218.44 --> 9221.24]  Um, you know, you talk to, uh, talk to farmers.
[9221.24 --> 9223.70]  They hate lockdown John Deere tractors.
[9223.90 --> 9226.64]  You know, they're not, they're not getting a pass.
[9227.26 --> 9232.06]  Um, we tech folk just aren't really talking about it because it doesn't affect us day to day.
[9232.30 --> 9239.92]  Because no offense to you, uh, but you probably don't work with a drill every day because you watch this show.
[9239.92 --> 9244.46]  And yes, yes, you, I know you do, but most of the views don't.
[9244.82 --> 9252.36]  So we tend to kind of fixate on the things that affect us day to day, the things that we are closest to.
[9252.42 --> 9258.42]  I mean, that's, that's probably a significant contributor to how flipped out everybody was over MKBHD's wallpaper app.
[9258.88 --> 9264.22]  Uh, if someone that you didn't know, you know, if, uh, if, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, what's, what's her name?
[9264.32 --> 9268.14]  The, uh, uh, the goop, goop actress.
[9268.40 --> 9268.70]  Oh.
[9268.70 --> 9269.82]  Oh, whatever.
[9269.98 --> 9270.62]  The goop actress?
[9270.64 --> 9273.72]  Yeah, if she, if she launched some, uh, Gwyneth Paltrow.
[9273.74 --> 9274.04]  Oh, goop.
[9274.32 --> 9283.32]  Yeah, if she, if she launched some, if she launched some goop product that was like a hundred dollar, you know, cucumber slice that you put on your eye.
[9283.32 --> 9283.82]  You're not going to hear about it.
[9283.96 --> 9285.14]  You won't hear about it.
[9285.20 --> 9285.86]  You won't care.
[9285.96 --> 9288.26]  That doesn't mean that she got away with it, you know?
[9288.60 --> 9288.92]  Yeah.
[9289.18 --> 9290.16]  You just didn't care.
[9290.60 --> 9290.86]  Yeah.
[9291.58 --> 9293.00]  I'm fighting with a Milwaukee guy.
[9293.16 --> 9294.96]  You're forgetting about the brand loyalty as well.
[9294.96 --> 9301.74]  Um, yeah, they also might not care because they will happily give like Milwaukee $300 for a radio.
[9301.90 --> 9302.64]  Boo, Milwaukee.
[9302.88 --> 9305.34]  Get the Makita espresso machine that's battery powered.
[9305.48 --> 9306.42]  Yes, it's a real thing.
[9306.80 --> 9309.84]  There's a lot of brand war in trucks and tools.
[9309.84 --> 9311.98]  It's really intense with, uh, tools.
[9312.24 --> 9314.40]  Trucks and tools is a crazy one.
[9314.40 --> 9315.98]  You have a Ford.
[9316.08 --> 9317.26]  We can't be friends now.
[9317.28 --> 9318.84]  My dad's a Ryobi guy.
[9318.90 --> 9319.50]  I like the green.
[9319.66 --> 9325.74]  Dude, there's people who would actually just like use a manual screwdriver versus use a drill from a brand that they don't like.
[9325.88 --> 9327.82]  It's, it's, it is mind blowing too.
[9327.90 --> 9328.28]  As they should.
[9330.28 --> 9332.00]  I will not touch team red.
[9332.12 --> 9334.88]  So I wasn't, um, I wasn't kidding about that.
[9335.44 --> 9339.18]  This is, uh, this is a radio for $300 Canadian.
[9339.18 --> 9342.68]  Um, yeah, KMS tools is right.
[9343.56 --> 9346.24]  Look, uh, you gotta, you gotta show the Makita coffee maker.
[9347.48 --> 9348.26]  You have to.
[9348.30 --> 9348.90]  Makita coffee maker?
[9348.90 --> 9349.82]  I need you to.
[9350.52 --> 9351.92]  I know we're pressed for time, but.
[9352.90 --> 9353.30]  Okay.
[9354.00 --> 9356.12]  Well, at least it's cheaper than the other thing.
[9357.40 --> 9357.84]  Okay.
[9357.92 --> 9358.42]  I'm over it.
[9358.44 --> 9358.92]  I don't need to click.
[9359.00 --> 9359.60]  Yeah, that's fine.
[9359.64 --> 9360.22]  You get the point.
[9360.36 --> 9360.66]  All right.
[9361.66 --> 9362.96]  I appreciate you all.
[9363.02 --> 9367.08]  I am curious about how Linus's solar panels have been impacting his electric bill.
[9367.08 --> 9368.62]  Maybe an idea for a future video.
[9368.62 --> 9370.06]  Lowering it a bit.
[9372.16 --> 9379.62]  Hey, LLD, love how you guys keep reviews on LTT store as they are and don't censor poor reviews.
[9379.80 --> 9382.68]  That said, why are we not able to review products after a few months?
[9384.80 --> 9385.60]  I don't know.
[9386.90 --> 9388.48]  Just review them right away, I guess.
[9388.68 --> 9392.58]  Well, no, that's stupid because then if you wanted to leave a long-term review, you wouldn't be able to.
[9392.68 --> 9394.94]  I, uh, I don't know.
[9394.94 --> 9405.40]  Uh, we had an issue with our reviews, um, our reviews plugin this week where, uh, someone thought we were, uh, we, we had changed the, the gradient.
[9406.40 --> 9408.20]  Oh, it's still, it's still like this.
[9408.24 --> 9408.44]  Okay.
[9408.86 --> 9414.64]  So it, on some with very few reviews, it, the way the gradients work on the lower ones.
[9414.74 --> 9418.26]  Oh no, it's the, oh yeah, no, this is, this is better because the opacity was different.
[9418.90 --> 9419.22]  Opacity?
[9420.10 --> 9420.42]  Opaque.
[9420.78 --> 9421.10]  Opacity.
[9421.10 --> 9421.14]  Opacity.
[9421.54 --> 9424.44]  Oh, was it like blue at the, so it's harder to see or what?
[9424.46 --> 9425.56]  Um, yeah, the colors were different.
[9425.56 --> 9430.24]  So it made it seem like these ones were not as big when they were, yeah.
[9430.36 --> 9431.16]  We weren't doing that intentionally.
[9431.16 --> 9432.06]  No, no, we didn't do that intentionally.
[9432.08 --> 9432.46]  No, no, no, no.
[9432.48 --> 9432.84]  It's okay.
[9432.84 --> 9433.08]  It's okay.
[9433.16 --> 9433.38]  It's okay.
[9433.50 --> 9434.62]  Anyway, Conrad already fixed it.
[9434.64 --> 9437.02]  But the point is that, um, we didn't do that intentionally.
[9437.32 --> 9444.26]  The plugin that we use for customer reviews just like updated and like we didn't know and we had to manually intervene in order to make it not do that.
[9444.62 --> 9448.04]  Um, so it's possible that might just be a limitation of the platform we use.
[9448.08 --> 9450.90]  We don't, we didn't create our own review system.
[9451.10 --> 9455.82]  And like, I, there are things I don't like about it.
[9456.12 --> 9457.94]  Uh, I don't want us to make our own.
[9458.14 --> 9458.32]  Yeah.
[9458.66 --> 9460.14]  That's basically where we're at on this.
[9460.58 --> 9461.50]  It is what it is.
[9461.60 --> 9461.74]  Cool.
[9461.96 --> 9464.34]  I don't think anyone else internally wants us to make our own either.
[9464.46 --> 9464.70]  So.
[9464.92 --> 9465.12]  Yep.
[9465.60 --> 9465.96]  Sorry.
[9466.14 --> 9467.22]  That will not be an initiative.
[9467.58 --> 9470.72]  Yo, Linus, have you played Paper Mario, the thousand year door?
[9470.84 --> 9473.06]  It seems like the sort of RPG you'd have fun playing.
[9473.82 --> 9475.04]  I have not, but I should.
[9475.42 --> 9478.12]  Uh, it definitely seems like the sort of RPG I would enjoy.
[9479.02 --> 9480.12]  Oh, I accidentally.
[9480.46 --> 9480.88]  That's fine.
[9480.88 --> 9482.28]  Just archived a second one.
[9482.40 --> 9483.26]  Hi, Wansho.
[9483.34 --> 9484.00]  This is for you.
[9484.30 --> 9487.76]  Linus, uh, you have mentioned that you are emotionally needy in relationships.
[9487.98 --> 9492.16]  How did you and Yvonne deal with this and what conversation complications did you both have?
[9492.16 --> 9493.92]  Well, we're both emotionally needy.
[9493.92 --> 9506.44]  So we, um, met and then basically, you notice I never talk about friends that I have other
[9506.44 --> 9507.82]  than like people I work with.
[9507.82 --> 9510.34]  It's because Yvonne and Yvonne and I met.
[9510.34 --> 9514.74]  It's because Yvonne and I met, became completely, I believe the word is enmeshed.
[9515.74 --> 9516.10]  Enmeshed.
[9516.10 --> 9516.42]  Yeah.
[9516.42 --> 9516.46]  Yeah.
[9516.76 --> 9519.64]  And, um, healthy or not.
[9519.86 --> 9522.38]  Um, hey, we're coming up on 20 years, baby.
[9522.70 --> 9523.48]  I'd say that's healthy.
[9523.64 --> 9523.94]  Yeah.
[9524.06 --> 9524.48]  Congratulations.
[9524.78 --> 9525.26]  Um.
[9525.26 --> 9529.62]  So cool.
[9530.42 --> 9530.66]  All right.
[9530.70 --> 9532.08]  I found the one that you deleted.
[9532.76 --> 9534.06]  Uh, hello, WAN.DLL.
[9534.36 --> 9540.88]  I'm currently without power and internet due to four days due to the hurricane Helene, uh,
[9540.94 --> 9541.54]  but safe.
[9541.54 --> 9546.20]  How would you handle getting your tech family through a similar situation without power?
[9550.00 --> 9552.58]  I'm, I'm super obsessive about battery banks.
[9552.80 --> 9557.56]  I have tons and they tend to be rather charged.
[9558.10 --> 9562.68]  Um, I've got, I've got food and water reserves.
[9564.90 --> 9567.84]  The problem is that he's currently without power.
[9567.98 --> 9568.30]  Ah.
[9568.50 --> 9570.42]  That makes things really hard.
[9570.42 --> 9571.58]  You haven't already prepped.
[9571.90 --> 9572.10]  Yeah.
[9572.20 --> 9572.54]  I don't know.
[9573.04 --> 9579.46]  What, uh, what we did for a long time is we got an old generator from a boat.
[9580.40 --> 9581.90]  Diesel generator from a boat.
[9582.52 --> 9585.42]  And you could run that thing on like old engine oil if you wanted to.
[9585.82 --> 9586.80]  It was really powerful.
[9586.92 --> 9591.50]  Very, very, uh, easy to run, but giant, but also very cheap.
[9591.50 --> 9597.18]  A lot of people do the natural gas ones outside, but that doesn't really work if the natural gas
[9597.18 --> 9598.50]  infrastructure explodes.
[9598.50 --> 9599.04]  It explodes.
[9600.46 --> 9601.08]  Don't know.
[9601.34 --> 9604.46]  Code red 255 and float plane asks, is this a rerun?
[9607.34 --> 9611.42]  The WAN show is always live except for that one time.
[9611.48 --> 9614.86]  Was it April fools that we did a prerecorded one or was it Christmas?
[9614.86 --> 9616.18]  I think we did one on Christmas.
[9616.24 --> 9616.88]  I think it was Christmas.
[9617.30 --> 9619.12]  I think we've done it once or twice.
[9619.16 --> 9620.44]  We've prerecorded the WAN show.
[9621.40 --> 9623.86]  Um, I'll prove it.
[9625.54 --> 9627.34]  See, I wouldn't do that if it was prerecorded.
[9627.34 --> 9628.54]  Why would I think to prerecord that?
[9629.40 --> 9630.26]  That'd be crazy.
[9630.48 --> 9631.20]  40 chess.
[9632.78 --> 9633.74]  With time travel.
[9634.20 --> 9634.52]  Yeah.
[9634.52 --> 9637.44]  Okay.
[9637.60 --> 9638.64]  Well, last one then.
[9639.14 --> 9640.54]  Oh, ouch.
[9641.70 --> 9645.54]  Linus, I have heard you recommend Anno 1800 for years.
[9645.68 --> 9646.86]  I finally got the game for Steam.
[9647.26 --> 9651.22]  I have been playing on my Framework 13, do-it-yourself, Intel 12th gen.
[9651.30 --> 9651.52]  Nice.
[9651.52 --> 9653.62]  Do you have any suggestions for Annoob?
[9654.36 --> 9659.94]  Um, watch at least a couple of just like people's startup videos.
[9660.66 --> 9665.22]  And then invest no more than probably like 30 to 60 minutes in that.
[9665.34 --> 9666.02]  Cause it's fine.
[9666.06 --> 9668.40]  You'll, you'll, you'll want to explore for yourself, right?
[9668.42 --> 9670.34]  Like you'll want to kind of figure out your own way to do things.
[9670.36 --> 9676.14]  And then the other big one is look at just one or two videos of people kind of showing
[9676.14 --> 9681.12]  off their final states, because that'll give you some ideas in your mind for what you
[9681.12 --> 9685.04]  need to plan ahead for as you're laying the foundation of your city or cities.
[9686.96 --> 9692.34]  My thing would actually be something that Linus hammered in, hammered home for me.
[9692.76 --> 9696.76]  Um, I was somewhat sheltered when I, when I kind of first started playing Anno because
[9696.76 --> 9701.52]  I would just like be the military ship guy and then Linus would build all the islands.
[9701.70 --> 9705.34]  But something he used to mention all the time was to look at your production.
[9706.38 --> 9710.38]  So instead of just like looking at the map and, you know, you highlight over something
[9710.38 --> 9711.58]  and you're like, Oh, I don't have enough of this.
[9711.62 --> 9714.20]  I'll build another thing so that I can have more of it.
[9714.80 --> 9716.96]  Um, that's actually a pretty bad way to go.
[9717.18 --> 9723.60]  You want to look into your production and see how much you're, you're like resource harvesting
[9723.60 --> 9729.80]  places are generating versus how much your, your product producing places are using those
[9729.80 --> 9733.38]  things and making new ones and how many of those things you actually need and balance
[9733.38 --> 9734.06]  the equation.
[9734.06 --> 9739.86]  Um, instead of just like building kind of stuff that you think you might need, it's wildly
[9739.86 --> 9742.98]  more efficient and I find more rewarding.
[9742.98 --> 9749.66]  And once you figure that out on one Island, then the efficiency growth of like, Oh, actually
[9749.66 --> 9752.06]  potatoes take up a lot of freaking space.
[9752.06 --> 9754.66]  So I found this other Island that has potatoes.
[9754.66 --> 9757.74]  Maybe I'll just grow those there and I'll set up a trade route back and forth and do it
[9757.74 --> 9758.20]  that way.
[9758.20 --> 9761.32]  Doing stuff like that starts to become very natural.
[9762.56 --> 9762.68]  Yeah.
[9765.66 --> 9766.58]  This is cool.
[9766.70 --> 9767.56]  I didn't know about this.
[9769.20 --> 9770.76]  Someone pointed this out in chat.
[9771.34 --> 9773.70]  CAS multi-brand battery system.
[9775.16 --> 9776.36]  CAS brands.
[9777.48 --> 9781.50]  Um, cordless Alliance something.
[9781.58 --> 9783.70]  I think you just need like an adapter or something.
[9784.70 --> 9786.14]  Uh, I don't know.
[9786.88 --> 9787.20]  Um, I don't know.
[9788.20 --> 9789.04]  Metabo.
[9789.04 --> 9789.54]  Metabo.
[9792.12 --> 9793.24]  CAS cordless.
[9793.54 --> 9793.80]  Sorry.
[9794.14 --> 9797.04]  The drill communicates with the battery itself.
[9798.00 --> 9801.86]  The BMS has a specialized computer in it on each battery.
[9802.44 --> 9808.06]  Um, I know because, uh, family friend is a Makita dealer and he gets us buckets of old
[9808.06 --> 9810.40]  batteries that have basically just failed.
[9810.40 --> 9814.08]  And then we Frankenstein them back together, make adapter plates and things like that.
[9814.48 --> 9817.04]  Um, it's very interesting.
[9817.04 --> 9818.26]  Cool.
[9818.36 --> 9820.42]  I forget what does CAS stand for?
[9820.46 --> 9821.66]  I think we've love hugged to the site.
[9821.76 --> 9822.98]  Oh, cordless Alliance system.
[9823.08 --> 9823.44]  There it is.
[9823.98 --> 9824.32]  Cool.
[9824.58 --> 9825.58]  Well, good luck with that.
[9825.58 --> 9829.64]  And good luck with you guys finding something else to do now.
[9830.40 --> 9831.44]  Cause it's the end of the show.
[9831.80 --> 9832.00]  Yeah.
[9832.12 --> 9832.84]  We'll see you again next week.
[9832.90 --> 9833.34]  Same bad time.
[9833.40 --> 9833.86]  Same bad channel.
[9834.58 --> 9834.94]  Bye.
[9837.86 --> 9838.42]  Go home.
[9838.90 --> 9839.54]  Medicate your birds.
[9839.54 --> 9840.34]  Yes.
[9840.34 --> 9841.60]  You.
[9841.66 --> 9842.32]  Go to이션.
[9842.32 --> 9846.26]  Hey.
[9846.52 --> 9847.56]  Go home.
[9847.72 --> 9851.60]  Oh, God.
[9851.60 --> 9863.86]  Outro Music
