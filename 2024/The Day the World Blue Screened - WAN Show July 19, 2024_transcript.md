[0.00 --> 2.60]  And welcome to the WAN show!
[4.24 --> 6.82]  We've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today.
[6.96 --> 12.66]  Of course, there was the big global IT meltdown
[12.66 --> 16.68]  that took place thanks to cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.
[16.90 --> 19.56]  We'll be talking a little bit about that as well as just the
[19.56 --> 26.58]  implications of how hyper-centralized our global IT infrastructure is.
[26.76 --> 28.40]  It's kind of scary.
[28.40 --> 33.02]  We'll also be talking about an STI screening app
[33.02 --> 37.46]  that asked people to submit genital pictures
[37.46 --> 42.38]  for AI screening, or for AI evaluation.
[42.84 --> 44.62]  That got shut down by the FTC.
[44.76 --> 45.58]  We'll be talking about that.
[45.64 --> 46.44]  What else we got?
[46.62 --> 50.26]  There's an MMO publisher saying that Intel is selling defective chips,
[50.74 --> 51.60]  which is rough.
[51.60 --> 56.52]  And a company apologized to reviewer Golden Sound
[56.52 --> 58.08]  for threatening them.
[58.40 --> 58.98]  Yeah.
[59.16 --> 59.76]  Oh my.
[59.86 --> 61.24]  You shouldn't threaten Golden Sound.
[61.26 --> 61.84]  Don't do that.
[61.86 --> 63.06]  I'm going to give you a golden shower.
[64.12 --> 64.48]  Um.
[68.42 --> 68.90]  What?
[70.40 --> 70.84]  Um.
[72.84 --> 74.08]  We just started.
[75.52 --> 76.40]  You can't.
[76.40 --> 77.18]  You can't do that.
[77.18 --> 79.46]  Going to be that kind of show today, folks.
[79.54 --> 80.16]  Oh, wow.
[80.38 --> 80.58]  Woo.
[80.96 --> 81.94]  That's a case of rule.
[82.04 --> 82.60]  Here we go.
[83.14 --> 90.70]  Show is brought to you today by Vessi Ridge, RFs, and Secret Lab, our chair partner.
[91.16 --> 92.20]  There's also going to be.
[92.20 --> 93.24]  At least those shoes are water resistant.
[93.24 --> 93.80]  Um.
[94.10 --> 97.40]  There's also going to be something a little bit special.
[97.56 --> 98.48]  Ahrefs, excuse me.
[98.54 --> 99.34]  I pronounced that wrong.
[99.40 --> 100.04]  I always do that.
[100.40 --> 103.78]  Ahrefs, there's also a special extra sponsor today.
[104.92 --> 106.48]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[106.66 --> 108.32]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[108.32 --> 108.40]  Uh.
[109.90 --> 110.96]  We're doing it live.
[111.08 --> 111.90]  The classic.
[112.28 --> 113.46]  We're doing it live.
[113.58 --> 114.40]  We're doing it live.
[114.58 --> 115.44]  We're doing it live.
[115.46 --> 115.94]  I think.
[116.16 --> 117.54]  Wait, I don't see any.
[117.54 --> 117.74]  Who's doing it?
[118.54 --> 119.00]  Did anyone?
[119.44 --> 120.02]  I have it.
[120.20 --> 120.52]  Okay.
[121.18 --> 122.88]  I think they wanted you to do some of it.
[123.02 --> 124.04]  We're doing it live.
[124.18 --> 125.32]  Are you just going to do some of it?
[127.32 --> 129.76]  Luke, I already did some of it.
[129.86 --> 130.30]  Wait, what?
[130.92 --> 131.20]  Whoa!
[131.72 --> 131.96]  Whoa!
[131.96 --> 132.24]  Whoa!
[132.24 --> 132.60]  Whoa!
[132.60 --> 133.20]  Whoa!
[137.30 --> 138.90]  I'll explain that later.
[139.14 --> 140.76]  You've always been facing me.
[140.88 --> 142.56]  I genuinely had no idea.
[143.00 --> 145.30]  That was a fully real reaction.
[146.34 --> 148.18]  I never saw that.
[149.82 --> 151.86]  Okay, so you're doing the rest of it.
[151.92 --> 155.64]  All right, let's jump right into our big topic this week.
[155.74 --> 156.04]  Wow.
[156.04 --> 161.46]  Today, the world was struck with an historic IT outage
[161.46 --> 166.26]  as Windows systems in businesses and government buildings around the globe
[166.26 --> 169.24]  were sent into endless boot loops.
[169.84 --> 173.78]  This has led to business at airports and banks grinding to a halt
[173.78 --> 177.30]  while hospitals have wound up canceling non-emergency operations
[177.30 --> 182.58]  and, this one's really awful, emergency hotlines, so 911,
[183.18 --> 185.72]  even went down in multiple U.S. states.
[186.58 --> 189.94]  Cybersecurity company, Microsoft's got to be sitting there going,
[189.94 --> 194.88]  okay, this is bad, but at least it wasn't us.
[195.62 --> 200.26]  Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike has taken responsibility for the outage,
[200.38 --> 203.68]  which was apparently caused by a faulty software update
[203.68 --> 206.10]  for their Falcon Sensor security platform.
[206.34 --> 210.72]  The company has enacted a fix, but, okay, dude,
[211.26 --> 213.42]  have you looked at the replies on their Twitter?
[214.72 --> 215.06]  Yeah.
[215.06 --> 222.60]  Okay, I saw everything from people claiming to be shareholders
[222.60 --> 229.84]  asking pointed questions about how they're going to regain trust
[229.84 --> 233.14]  and have a functioning business moving forward
[233.14 --> 239.30]  to IT managers demanding to know what the compensation is going to be.
[239.30 --> 241.70]  And if you're wondering why they're so mad, guys,
[241.82 --> 245.46]  this is not like, oh, roll it back, okay?
[245.78 --> 247.36]  The fix is in.
[248.00 --> 249.86]  That's not what that means, but the point is,
[249.98 --> 252.40]  there is a fix, but unfortunately,
[252.80 --> 256.30]  it requires the affected computer to be...
[256.30 --> 259.82]  Oh, it's turned on.
[259.90 --> 260.42]  It needs to work.
[260.60 --> 261.30]  It needs to be online.
[261.30 --> 263.52]  It can't turn on right now because it's boot looping.
[263.52 --> 266.84]  So you have to have physical access to the machine,
[267.20 --> 268.74]  boot into some safe mode,
[268.96 --> 271.10]  and then manually remove files.
[271.32 --> 271.52]  Yes.
[271.66 --> 273.76]  So first of all, the computer has to be online,
[273.90 --> 275.32]  and then there's the other fix,
[275.66 --> 279.60]  which they suggest rebooting the computer as many as 15 times
[279.60 --> 280.78]  might fix it.
[281.14 --> 282.78]  So that one, okay, great.
[282.78 --> 284.74]  And then there's the one that Luke said
[284.74 --> 286.30]  where you can reboot in safe mode,
[286.62 --> 287.70]  remove some files,
[287.88 --> 290.92]  and then boot again, be online, and get it fixed.
[291.06 --> 291.92]  And CrowdStrike,
[292.62 --> 295.10]  there was groups before CrowdStrike said anything,
[295.18 --> 295.60]  I believe,
[295.98 --> 298.24]  that came up with ways to fix it,
[298.30 --> 298.92]  which was cool.
[299.10 --> 301.84]  And then CrowdStrike put out like an official way to do it,
[301.84 --> 302.80]  which was a little bit cleaner
[302.80 --> 305.12]  and worked well.
[305.12 --> 309.04]  But you need manual in-person intervention.
[309.04 --> 312.84]  So companies that have outsourced or remote IT
[312.84 --> 315.82]  are in a pretty rough spot right now.
[316.00 --> 317.24]  Yeah, this is kind of scary.
[317.46 --> 318.38]  Also, a fun one.
[318.48 --> 319.66]  Did you see the BitLocker stuff?
[319.76 --> 320.34]  Is that in here?
[320.58 --> 322.40]  No, I heard about it.
[322.62 --> 325.62]  I have only heard about as much as you just said.
[325.92 --> 329.32]  Apparently, Microsoft is like nuking BitLocker keys
[329.32 --> 330.22]  or something like that.
[330.30 --> 331.60]  Can you elaborate?
[331.60 --> 334.62]  So a lot to do with this story
[334.62 --> 337.10]  is happening kind of live.
[337.26 --> 339.58]  This is still a little early to talk about it, I think.
[339.84 --> 341.76]  I've read a decent amount of stuff
[341.76 --> 343.60]  that has turned out to be misinformation already.
[343.76 --> 345.08]  This doesn't seem to be one of those things.
[345.16 --> 346.48]  I'm just warning people that that's true.
[346.84 --> 349.24]  Also, as with all of these types of topics,
[349.34 --> 350.98]  there's only so far we can really go into it.
[350.98 --> 352.86]  I would recommend checking out
[352.86 --> 358.26]  various people that cover this type of thing more in depth.
[358.54 --> 359.96]  But the BitLocker stuff,
[359.96 --> 363.70]  you know, to be able to get into the computer in that way,
[363.76 --> 364.96]  you're going to need your BitLocker key.
[365.14 --> 367.94]  A lot of these companies are storing their BitLocker keys
[367.94 --> 372.54]  on systems that currently can't turn on.
[376.20 --> 379.32]  So they literally are just stuck.
[380.18 --> 383.38]  They might even have IT teams ready to come in
[383.38 --> 384.72]  and fix this stuff in person.
[384.80 --> 385.72]  They might be ready to go
[385.72 --> 386.82]  and there's nothing they can do
[386.82 --> 388.68]  because they can't even get the computers
[388.68 --> 390.40]  to the point where they could even fix it
[390.40 --> 392.00]  because they need the BitLocker keys
[392.00 --> 393.88]  and the BitLocker keys are stuck on a computer
[393.88 --> 394.86]  that they can't fix.
[396.32 --> 396.82]  So rough.
[397.90 --> 400.26]  Linux systems are unaffected by the outage
[400.26 --> 402.32]  as are Windows systems in Russia,
[402.42 --> 403.16]  of all places,
[403.32 --> 406.32]  where CrowdStrike software is unavailable due to sanctions.
[406.68 --> 407.96]  And coupled in with that,
[408.04 --> 409.74]  effectively, just it's CrowdStrike.
[409.74 --> 411.16]  So if you don't have CrowdStrike on your system,
[411.24 --> 412.16]  you're not affected.
[412.16 --> 414.36]  So our discussion question here is,
[414.48 --> 417.50]  this is kind of like if Y2K actually happened
[417.50 --> 419.54]  the way that people worried it would.
[420.04 --> 422.96]  Obviously, on a relatively small scale,
[422.96 --> 426.02]  because not every organization is using CrowdStrike,
[426.10 --> 427.20]  I have to confess to you,
[427.42 --> 429.22]  I was not aware of them.
[429.32 --> 430.50]  I don't live in that space.
[430.66 --> 431.64]  I have heard a data point.
[431.72 --> 433.18]  I think this came from John Hammond.
[433.32 --> 436.24]  I heard a data point that was over 500
[436.24 --> 438.94]  of the top 1,000 U.S. companies run CrowdStrike.
[439.42 --> 440.34]  With that said,
[440.56 --> 441.24]  with that said,
[441.34 --> 443.24]  Y2K was...
[444.32 --> 445.24]  It was supposed to be everything.
[445.38 --> 446.30]  You were pretty young
[446.30 --> 448.12]  when the fear-mongering was going on.
[448.14 --> 449.30]  Oh, but I was walking around Best Buy
[449.30 --> 450.78]  when they all had the Y2K stickers
[450.78 --> 451.60]  and all that kind of stuff.
[451.96 --> 453.76]  Y2K was a huge deal.
[454.12 --> 456.84]  Literally, the FUD that was floating around
[456.84 --> 460.00]  was that when the clock struck midnight
[460.00 --> 461.60]  on the year 2000,
[461.86 --> 465.48]  and every software that had a calendar
[465.48 --> 468.04]  that was only programmed to go as high as 1999,
[468.50 --> 469.62]  and then it would just crash...
[469.62 --> 471.64]  Like, literally every computer,
[472.12 --> 473.64]  unless it was, you know,
[473.90 --> 475.82]  Hacksword to be Y2K compliant,
[475.90 --> 476.80]  but even then, I don't know,
[476.84 --> 477.38]  it might break.
[477.56 --> 480.66]  And all software was just going to stop working.
[481.06 --> 483.28]  Planes were going to fall out of the sky.
[483.50 --> 485.08]  Like, just everything was going to be
[485.08 --> 486.60]  absolute chaos and on fire.
[487.00 --> 488.70]  And this was horrible,
[489.82 --> 490.58]  but it wasn't quite that.
[490.66 --> 491.08]  It wasn't that.
[491.26 --> 492.92]  I've heard everyone and their mom
[492.92 --> 494.22]  bringing up the Y2K reference.
[494.22 --> 496.24]  There's been a lot of people saying the same things
[496.24 --> 497.66]  about this whole CrowdStrike thing,
[497.84 --> 500.60]  but hugely impactful.
[500.86 --> 501.58]  Hugely impactful.
[501.74 --> 503.92]  I think it's going to take quite a while
[503.92 --> 507.26]  for us to actually really understand
[507.26 --> 509.50]  what the impact was.
[511.42 --> 513.08]  Because, like, I mean, I saw...
[513.08 --> 514.76]  And you don't know what of these images
[514.76 --> 516.12]  are doctored or not doctored,
[516.20 --> 518.24]  but I saw an image of an MRI machine
[518.24 --> 519.32]  that was blue screened out.
[519.32 --> 523.26]  There's questions on, like,
[523.28 --> 525.38]  what is this going to do to global supply chain?
[526.52 --> 528.32]  Anytime global supply chain is impacted,
[528.42 --> 529.44]  I know a lot of people might be like,
[529.48 --> 530.50]  oh, it doesn't affect me.
[530.56 --> 531.70]  It affects everybody.
[531.78 --> 531.96]  Yeah.
[532.52 --> 534.92]  From food to standard consumables,
[534.92 --> 535.76]  like toilet paper,
[535.84 --> 536.84]  we've seen that happen before.
[536.94 --> 537.34]  Transportation, everything.
[537.48 --> 538.12]  General transportation.
[539.00 --> 541.30]  It's the amount of people that were grounded
[541.30 --> 543.14]  because a lot of the airlines weren't running.
[544.14 --> 545.98]  How is that going to impact things?
[546.10 --> 547.14]  Some of those travel...
[547.72 --> 549.32]  Some of that travel wasn't just people, like,
[549.42 --> 550.82]  going on vacation for funsies.
[551.02 --> 551.16]  Yeah.
[551.22 --> 553.20]  It was very important things happening.
[553.92 --> 556.58]  Southwest, I heard this through grapevines.
[556.68 --> 557.92]  This is another one of the things that we're like,
[557.98 --> 558.96]  I don't know if it's true or not,
[559.20 --> 560.74]  but I've heard that Southwest is still up
[560.74 --> 561.64]  and running just fine
[561.64 --> 564.04]  because they're still running Windows 3.1.
[566.44 --> 567.98]  So no problems there.
[569.52 --> 571.04]  Here's my big question,
[571.04 --> 572.44]  or here's my big fear.
[573.14 --> 575.14]  This was an oopsie doodles.
[575.82 --> 575.96]  Yeah.
[576.42 --> 577.12]  Oh, yeah.
[577.38 --> 579.04]  The implication of that is insane.
[579.26 --> 582.26]  I think we're looking at what effectively war would be like
[582.26 --> 585.84]  if it was through large, like, world powers.
[586.08 --> 586.10]  Yeah.
[586.16 --> 589.30]  If we were looking at state-sponsored activity,
[589.48 --> 593.14]  that was not just, you know, harassment, you know.
[593.26 --> 594.36]  Trolling, fake news, harassment.
[594.36 --> 595.36]  Digital skirmishes, you know.
[595.36 --> 595.46]  Yeah.
[595.86 --> 599.26]  Like what an actual all-out assault
[599.26 --> 602.30]  on our digital infrastructure might look like.
[602.30 --> 604.72]  Because we've often talked about things like power,
[605.08 --> 606.84]  power, water,
[606.98 --> 609.04]  these like standard infrastructure things.
[609.24 --> 610.76]  I don't think we've thought about something
[610.76 --> 611.84]  on this level before.
[612.30 --> 615.76]  And like another part of that topic
[615.76 --> 617.90]  is it's often discussed about how,
[617.98 --> 619.56]  like, the most effective way
[619.56 --> 621.68]  to deliver malware
[621.68 --> 623.78]  is effectively usually like social engineering.
[623.78 --> 625.50]  What if you just got a job
[625.50 --> 626.50]  at one of these companies
[626.50 --> 628.06]  and then push something?
[630.54 --> 631.56]  Sheesh, man.
[631.86 --> 632.18]  Yeah.
[632.48 --> 633.04]  So...
[633.04 --> 634.96]  If it's a, you know,
[635.16 --> 635.94]  I don't remember exactly what,
[636.00 --> 636.90]  state-sponsored,
[637.24 --> 638.20]  like that might be something
[638.20 --> 639.10]  that's a viable option.
[639.48 --> 639.60]  Yeah.
[639.60 --> 640.78]  And to be clear,
[640.78 --> 641.18]  like,
[641.92 --> 644.20]  we don't necessarily,
[644.62 --> 644.78]  like,
[644.86 --> 646.06]  we know enough...
[646.06 --> 646.36]  We don't know.
[646.48 --> 647.90]  ...to kind of go,
[648.00 --> 648.52]  oh, you know,
[648.58 --> 650.22]  that could potentially be plausible
[650.22 --> 652.06]  or that couldn't or...
[652.06 --> 653.36]  But we don't know
[653.36 --> 655.58]  exactly what exploits
[655.58 --> 656.34]  are
[656.34 --> 657.40]  there.
[657.48 --> 658.66]  And I guarantee you,
[658.70 --> 660.20]  what I can tell you for sure
[660.20 --> 662.00]  is that there are
[662.00 --> 663.64]  zero days
[663.64 --> 664.24]  that
[664.24 --> 666.12]  large entities
[666.12 --> 667.28]  have in their back pocket
[667.28 --> 668.56]  that they are
[668.56 --> 670.00]  waiting
[670.00 --> 671.12]  to use.
[671.78 --> 672.74]  And they are constantly
[672.74 --> 673.88]  developing new ones
[673.88 --> 675.78]  as these things get patched
[675.78 --> 676.34]  and as
[676.34 --> 678.04]  the holes get filled in.
[678.54 --> 679.40]  And it is
[679.40 --> 681.44]  terrifying
[681.44 --> 682.96]  to think of
[682.96 --> 683.88]  trying to
[683.88 --> 684.46]  operate
[684.46 --> 685.86]  in this modern world
[685.86 --> 686.96]  if there was
[686.96 --> 687.80]  a capable
[687.80 --> 689.82]  organized actor
[689.82 --> 690.60]  that was working
[690.60 --> 691.58]  to prevent us
[691.58 --> 692.32]  from having access
[692.32 --> 693.24]  to what we...
[693.24 --> 695.18]  What is a basic necessity now,
[695.28 --> 695.54]  like,
[695.74 --> 696.30]  power
[696.30 --> 697.62]  and running water?
[698.24 --> 698.46]  Right?
[698.52 --> 699.48]  Like, it's not like...
[699.48 --> 701.10]  It's not like we just got
[701.10 --> 701.92]  in-home plumbing
[701.92 --> 702.86]  20 years ago
[702.86 --> 704.38]  and the well,
[704.92 --> 705.22]  you know,
[705.26 --> 706.16]  still works.
[706.38 --> 707.04]  And everyone,
[707.32 --> 708.22]  for the most part,
[708.38 --> 709.16]  still lives
[709.16 --> 710.72]  walking distance from it.
[711.00 --> 711.22]  You know,
[711.22 --> 713.22]  like, it's...
[713.22 --> 713.64]  Yeah.
[714.26 --> 715.02]  We'd be ducks!
[715.80 --> 716.74]  Ducks that are sitting!
[717.20 --> 717.68]  That's...
[717.68 --> 718.76]  That's the word for it, right?
[718.90 --> 719.62]  Ducks that are sitting?
[720.50 --> 721.42]  Sitting ducks, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[721.44 --> 721.66]  No, no,
[721.72 --> 722.38]  ducks that are sitting.
[723.62 --> 724.34]  Nobody says it
[724.34 --> 725.24]  that weird way you said it.
[725.24 --> 727.74]  Someone posted this.
[727.82 --> 728.14]  Apparently,
[728.30 --> 729.76]  Air India's systems were down,
[729.84 --> 730.26]  so they started
[730.26 --> 731.30]  handwriting tickets.
[732.36 --> 733.18]  Oh, my goodness.
[734.10 --> 734.52]  I mean,
[734.66 --> 736.20]  you gotta respect the hustle.
[736.40 --> 737.00]  I actually...
[737.00 --> 737.60]  I kinda like it.
[737.92 --> 738.60]  You gotta do what you gotta do.
[739.46 --> 739.82]  So,
[740.30 --> 740.74]  CrowdStrike,
[740.88 --> 741.80]  do they survive this?
[743.80 --> 744.20]  Remember,
[744.36 --> 745.46]  this is America.
[746.22 --> 747.10]  This is the land
[747.10 --> 747.76]  of the lawsuit.
[748.72 --> 749.86]  People are gonna die.
[750.26 --> 751.30]  Well, people...
[751.30 --> 752.00]  Rather,
[752.28 --> 752.90]  they're gonna start
[752.90 --> 753.80]  tallying up.
[753.80 --> 755.20]  Yeah,
[755.44 --> 756.54]  it's gonna be billions.
[759.16 --> 759.92]  I don't know.
[760.80 --> 761.58]  It's hard to tell.
[761.90 --> 762.96]  CW Float says,
[763.16 --> 764.44]  renewals are gonna suffer.
[766.98 --> 767.46]  Yeah.
[770.04 --> 770.96]  Oh, man.
[771.66 --> 773.20]  No, this took out the FAA.
[775.02 --> 775.70]  I'm not...
[775.70 --> 776.42]  They apparently lost
[776.42 --> 777.94]  about 20% of their valuation.
[777.94 --> 778.78]  Yeah, their stock
[778.78 --> 780.76]  tanked pretty hard.
[781.44 --> 781.94]  I just...
[781.94 --> 782.18]  I don't know.
[782.26 --> 783.16]  They're an actually
[783.16 --> 785.30]  enormous company,
[785.30 --> 786.00]  but it's not like
[786.00 --> 787.50]  there isn't other options
[787.50 --> 788.20]  sitting there.
[788.34 --> 789.24]  And honestly,
[789.24 --> 790.30]  it's not like
[790.30 --> 791.20]  plug-and-playing
[791.20 --> 792.18]  some of these other options
[792.18 --> 792.76]  would even be
[792.76 --> 793.54]  all that hard.
[793.86 --> 794.88]  I'm sure companies
[794.88 --> 795.74]  like SentinelOne,
[795.84 --> 796.64]  the one that we use,
[796.84 --> 798.06]  are looking at this
[798.06 --> 799.42]  just hungry.
[799.42 --> 802.08]  This is crazy.
[802.36 --> 803.06]  Tiltlord says,
[803.14 --> 803.64]  did you see the
[803.64 --> 804.92]  Wall Street bets post
[804.92 --> 806.28]  a few hours before
[806.28 --> 806.92]  the update
[806.92 --> 808.02]  where a guy was saying
[808.02 --> 809.40]  CrowdStrike was overvalued
[809.40 --> 810.30]  and shorted the
[810.30 --> 811.08]  stuffing out of it?
[812.18 --> 812.84]  Good job.
[813.68 --> 814.54]  Lucky job.
[814.96 --> 815.84]  Congrats on my yacht.
[816.06 --> 817.00]  Congratulations on
[817.00 --> 817.84]  winning the lottery
[817.84 --> 819.18]  because that's what
[819.18 --> 819.66]  you did.
[819.92 --> 820.00]  Yeah.
[820.00 --> 821.00]  But, uh...
[822.16 --> 822.74]  Wow.
[825.46 --> 825.90]  Cool.
[826.22 --> 827.12]  Why don't we do
[827.12 --> 828.20]  our next topic?
[828.46 --> 829.12]  Luke, would you like
[829.12 --> 829.98]  to pick one?
[830.26 --> 830.62]  Sure.
[831.40 --> 832.40]  Not that one.
[832.92 --> 833.26]  What?
[834.08 --> 835.02]  Oh, I just assumed
[835.02 --> 835.74]  you'd want to start
[835.74 --> 836.28]  the hair dye.
[837.04 --> 837.78]  Oh, no.
[838.10 --> 838.84]  We'll do that later.
[839.02 --> 839.26]  Yeah.
[840.20 --> 841.68]  Netflix would rather you...
[841.68 --> 842.64]  Wait, no.
[842.72 --> 843.66]  Why don't you just pick it?
[843.78 --> 844.88]  No, I'm not going to pick it.
[844.96 --> 845.80]  I'm not going to pick it.
[846.38 --> 848.02]  What I am going to do, though,
[848.10 --> 849.98]  is I am going to announce
[849.98 --> 850.92]  that we have added
[850.92 --> 853.48]  some surprise WAN show deals
[853.48 --> 855.22]  to celebrate Lime Day.
[855.84 --> 856.86]  They are live on
[856.86 --> 858.76]  LTTstore.com now,
[858.96 --> 860.00]  but we've also given
[860.00 --> 861.14]  Linus a button to drop
[861.14 --> 862.68]  other deals throughout
[862.68 --> 863.32]  the show.
[863.92 --> 865.70]  Very limited quantity deals.
[865.82 --> 866.52]  Do you not know about that?
[866.56 --> 867.86]  Make sure you stay tuned
[867.86 --> 868.86]  for the whole thing.
[869.00 --> 869.72]  They showed me
[869.72 --> 871.22]  a mechanism to do stuff.
[871.30 --> 871.82]  I haven't looked
[871.82 --> 873.52]  especially closely at it.
[874.38 --> 875.30]  So we're going to have
[875.30 --> 876.80]  some amazing deals
[876.80 --> 877.40]  coming up.
[877.40 --> 878.78]  We're also offering
[878.78 --> 879.72]  free shipping
[879.72 --> 880.90]  on all orders
[880.90 --> 882.66]  over $100.
[883.82 --> 885.66]  So if you're looking
[885.66 --> 886.84]  for some of the deals
[886.84 --> 887.48]  that we have
[887.48 --> 888.70]  going on right now,
[888.76 --> 889.28]  we've got the
[889.28 --> 890.42]  dropout hoodie.
[891.02 --> 892.14]  Do I have like a...
[892.14 --> 893.04]  Do I have like a sheet
[893.04 --> 894.22]  that has maybe...
[894.22 --> 895.70]  Maybe the things?
[895.84 --> 896.32]  I don't know.
[897.12 --> 898.08]  Is there a summary
[898.08 --> 898.70]  of the deals?
[899.14 --> 899.98]  Well, I don't know,
[900.06 --> 901.56]  but Artie put some reviews
[901.56 --> 903.30]  of the various items
[903.30 --> 904.20]  that are on sale in here,
[904.24 --> 905.04]  so I'm going to read those.
[905.48 --> 906.22]  The dropout hoodie.
[906.22 --> 907.20]  When Luke claimed
[907.20 --> 907.80]  on Wancho,
[907.84 --> 908.70]  this is from Tobias,
[908.90 --> 909.58]  that this hoodie
[909.58 --> 910.20]  was comfortable,
[910.38 --> 911.34]  he sure wasn't lying.
[911.60 --> 911.62]  Yeah.
[911.76 --> 912.40]  It's from a heavier
[912.40 --> 913.12]  and thicker material
[913.12 --> 913.98]  than other hoodies I own.
[914.26 --> 915.62]  It is hella comfy.
[916.08 --> 916.82]  We've also got
[916.82 --> 918.30]  the windbreaker on promo.
[918.46 --> 919.16]  Kyle R. says,
[919.28 --> 920.40]  even better than expected.
[920.74 --> 921.66]  This jacket's awesome.
[921.82 --> 922.58]  It's light and comfortable
[922.58 --> 923.22]  while being great
[923.22 --> 923.90]  for wind and rain.
[924.02 --> 924.76]  It also rolls up
[924.76 --> 925.34]  small enough
[925.34 --> 926.18]  for me to shove it
[926.18 --> 926.72]  in my backpack
[926.72 --> 927.56]  while at an event,
[927.60 --> 928.40]  which is very helpful.
[928.82 --> 929.92]  We've got the button-up shirt.
[930.32 --> 930.92]  Business look,
[930.98 --> 931.54]  casual feel,
[931.68 --> 932.54]  awesome shirt,
[932.86 --> 934.00]  says Nathaniel M.
[934.00 --> 934.74]  from Australia.
[935.40 --> 935.86]  Great feel,
[935.98 --> 937.04]  comfortable with a bit of stretch.
[937.24 --> 938.64]  Quickly self-ironing,
[938.68 --> 939.16]  so to speak,
[939.34 --> 941.50]  as if as soon as it's washed,
[941.54 --> 942.34]  you put it on a coat hanger
[942.34 --> 942.82]  to dry.
[944.80 --> 945.82]  Oh, more colors
[945.82 --> 946.34]  and short sleeves
[946.34 --> 947.14]  so I can throw out
[947.14 --> 948.00]  all my other business shirts.
[948.14 --> 949.04]  Please, Linus.
[949.44 --> 950.44]  John W. says,
[950.52 --> 951.40]  of the RGB hoodie,
[951.50 --> 952.76]  which is also on promo.
[952.98 --> 954.10]  That's a desk pad review.
[954.10 --> 955.10]  I think someone...
[956.30 --> 958.20]  Of the PCMR desk pad.
[958.56 --> 958.88]  Okay.
[960.58 --> 961.18]  There you go.
[961.26 --> 961.66]  Thanks, Artie.
[962.00 --> 962.74]  Don't worry, I got you.
[963.00 --> 963.88]  After a month of use,
[963.94 --> 964.54]  I can say this, Matt,
[964.56 --> 965.56]  has been wonderful.
[966.20 --> 967.84]  And of the women's PJ set,
[967.96 --> 968.76]  Allison W. says,
[969.04 --> 971.18]  most comfortable PJs.
[972.00 --> 972.52]  Got them.
[973.18 --> 973.58]  Nice.
[974.02 --> 974.30]  Nice.
[974.64 --> 975.04]  All right.
[975.30 --> 975.66]  Cool.
[976.06 --> 976.82]  So, oh, yeah.
[976.88 --> 977.54]  So the windbreaker
[977.54 --> 978.52]  is 33% off.
[978.58 --> 979.10]  The dropout hoodie
[979.10 --> 980.26]  is 25% off.
[980.26 --> 981.14]  The button-up shirt
[981.14 --> 982.68]  is 25% off.
[983.04 --> 984.16]  The fruit underwear?
[984.30 --> 984.94]  The fruit underwear
[984.94 --> 986.02]  is 50% off?
[986.36 --> 986.60]  Okay.
[986.68 --> 987.54]  Well, Artie's populating
[987.54 --> 988.08]  this list.
[988.44 --> 989.24]  Why don't you go ahead
[989.24 --> 990.16]  and pick a topic
[990.16 --> 992.40]  while people frantically
[992.40 --> 993.52]  browse the site?
[993.94 --> 994.88]  Some of these deals
[994.88 --> 996.28]  are also limited quantity
[996.28 --> 997.28]  in addition to the
[997.28 --> 998.78]  surprise random ones.
[999.04 --> 999.44]  So get rid...
[999.44 --> 1000.22]  Oh, my God.
[1001.96 --> 1002.90]  Oh, oh, no, no.
[1002.94 --> 1003.68]  I'm looking at the...
[1003.68 --> 1004.16]  I'm looking...
[1004.16 --> 1004.62]  I'm still looking
[1004.62 --> 1005.16]  at the dashboard
[1005.16 --> 1006.00]  from last week,
[1006.12 --> 1006.92]  I think.
[1007.92 --> 1008.42]  Which one?
[1008.42 --> 1009.16]  No, I don't think you are.
[1009.88 --> 1010.32]  What?
[1010.46 --> 1010.72]  Really?
[1012.50 --> 1012.90]  Uh...
[1012.90 --> 1013.50]  Dan?
[1013.66 --> 1014.30]  How you doing?
[1014.46 --> 1015.10]  We have two people
[1015.10 --> 1015.42]  on this.
[1015.46 --> 1015.70]  We're good.
[1015.80 --> 1016.44]  How you doing, buddy?
[1016.60 --> 1017.10]  We're doing fine.
[1017.16 --> 1017.86]  You doing okay, buddy?
[1017.96 --> 1018.40]  Yeah, we're everywhere.
[1018.58 --> 1019.36]  Lots of practice.
[1019.92 --> 1020.62]  Oh, yeah, I gotta start
[1020.62 --> 1021.72]  minimizing the whole sections.
[1022.20 --> 1023.38]  Holy crap.
[1023.60 --> 1024.06]  We're doing good.
[1024.12 --> 1024.62]  We're doing good.
[1025.20 --> 1025.96]  Uh, okay.
[1026.12 --> 1026.68]  But you're gonna be
[1026.68 --> 1027.56]  in control on this one.
[1027.56 --> 1028.42]  Are we fire-selling
[1028.42 --> 1029.18]  the...
[1029.18 --> 1029.72]  Everything.
[1030.24 --> 1030.94]  The thermal pads?
[1032.22 --> 1033.34]  Uh, yeah,
[1033.42 --> 1034.14]  no one talked to me
[1034.14 --> 1034.70]  about that.
[1034.88 --> 1035.20]  Oh.
[1036.16 --> 1037.34]  Are they on, like,
[1037.38 --> 1038.02]  crazy promo,
[1038.18 --> 1038.78]  or are they just
[1038.78 --> 1039.58]  a little bit promo?
[1040.24 --> 1041.14]  Um, they've been
[1041.14 --> 1042.12]  a really good seller.
[1042.28 --> 1042.80]  People...
[1042.80 --> 1043.62]  It's a great product,
[1043.62 --> 1044.38]  and people were just
[1044.38 --> 1046.00]  looking for a reputable
[1046.00 --> 1046.94]  place to buy it,
[1047.32 --> 1048.78]  um, at a reasonable price.
[1048.82 --> 1049.20]  Like, there were
[1049.20 --> 1049.86]  other places,
[1050.00 --> 1051.36]  but they were marked
[1051.36 --> 1052.56]  up so high.
[1052.64 --> 1053.22]  We were just like,
[1053.66 --> 1054.72]  what even is this?
[1054.72 --> 1055.20]  So we...
[1055.20 --> 1056.24]  So we bought a bunch,
[1056.58 --> 1057.50]  and now you're
[1057.50 --> 1058.38]  buying it from us.
[1059.08 --> 1059.68]  That's, like,
[1059.72 --> 1060.22]  right, that's how

[1096.84 --> 1098.24]  a huge spike in sales.

[1142.70 --> 1143.04]  All right.
[1143.14 --> 1143.50]  Topic.
[1144.82 --> 1145.50]  Wanna pick one?
[1146.10 --> 1146.50]  Sure.
[1146.82 --> 1147.36]  I already did.
[1147.36 --> 1148.48]  The Netflix one.
[1148.70 --> 1149.64]  Uh, Netflix would rather
[1149.64 --> 1150.44]  you watch ads.
[1150.46 --> 1151.16]  Oh, yeah.
[1151.52 --> 1153.00]  Netflix is discontinuing
[1153.00 --> 1154.26]  its $11.99.
[1154.64 --> 1156.02]  Nope, I'll call that $12.
[1156.50 --> 1158.12]  Netflix is discontinuing
[1158.12 --> 1160.02]  their $12 basic ad-free plan
[1160.02 --> 1161.58]  in the US and France,
[1161.96 --> 1163.24]  uh, pushing subscribers
[1163.24 --> 1164.82]  to choose from other options
[1164.82 --> 1167.42]  like $7 monthly plan.
[1167.80 --> 1169.30]  Like a $7 monthly plan
[1169.30 --> 1169.90]  with ads
[1169.90 --> 1173.10]  or a $15.50 standard HD plan
[1173.10 --> 1176.40]  or a $23 premium
[1176.40 --> 1177.54]  ultra HD plan
[1177.54 --> 1178.52]  without ads.
[1178.74 --> 1179.64]  The company saw
[1179.64 --> 1181.32]  a 34% increase
[1181.32 --> 1182.72]  in ad-supported subscriptions
[1182.72 --> 1183.84]  after introducing
[1183.84 --> 1184.72]  the standard
[1184.72 --> 1185.80]  with ads tier
[1185.80 --> 1188.00]  in November 2022,
[1188.54 --> 1189.56]  contributing to a record
[1189.56 --> 1192.38]  277.65 million subscribers.
[1192.74 --> 1193.56]  Holy...
[1193.56 --> 1194.18]  Isn't that wild?
[1194.24 --> 1194.56]  Wow.
[1195.16 --> 1195.46]  Yeah.
[1195.46 --> 1197.56]  In the second quarter
[1197.56 --> 1198.28]  of 2024.
[1199.18 --> 1200.90]  Partly due to increased signups
[1200.90 --> 1202.24]  for the cheaper plan
[1202.24 --> 1202.94]  and efforts
[1202.94 --> 1204.12]  to limit password sharing.
[1204.52 --> 1205.94]  Uh, this isn't a discussion question,
[1206.06 --> 1207.12]  but do you think
[1207.12 --> 1208.38]  it's gonna go back
[1208.38 --> 1209.96]  to being not many services
[1209.96 --> 1210.68]  other than Netflix?
[1210.68 --> 1212.26]  Because as far as I can tell,
[1212.96 --> 1214.54]  these other services
[1214.54 --> 1215.94]  are not really doing that well.
[1216.06 --> 1217.18]  Yeah, Paramount Plus
[1217.18 --> 1218.20]  just, uh,
[1218.30 --> 1219.96]  just ditched the, um,
[1219.96 --> 1221.36]  I think it's Paramount Plus
[1221.36 --> 1222.48]  that's not renewing Halo.
[1223.12 --> 1224.02]  Yeah, two years.
[1224.18 --> 1224.50]  I mean,
[1224.74 --> 1227.86]  what a show though.
[1228.28 --> 1228.94]  I never,
[1229.04 --> 1229.88]  I heard it was terrible.
[1230.42 --> 1231.90]  I was excited for it,
[1232.00 --> 1232.54]  um,
[1233.84 --> 1235.04]  and then I heard
[1235.04 --> 1235.94]  he takes off his helmet
[1235.94 --> 1236.54]  and I,
[1236.54 --> 1237.76]  I literally didn't even look
[1237.76 --> 1238.46]  for like anything.
[1238.46 --> 1239.14]  Like immediately?
[1239.76 --> 1240.76]  I don't even know.
[1240.96 --> 1241.86]  I never watched the show,
[1242.00 --> 1242.96]  but I just heard
[1242.96 --> 1244.04]  that he takes off his helmet
[1244.04 --> 1244.72]  and I was like,
[1244.72 --> 1247.42]  I'm not gonna like the show.
[1248.56 --> 1249.18]  I just,
[1249.26 --> 1250.48]  I just know immediately
[1250.48 --> 1251.16]  right then,
[1251.18 --> 1251.50]  I was like,
[1251.52 --> 1252.32]  it's not a show for me.
[1253.52 --> 1254.76]  And not because like,
[1254.82 --> 1255.06]  oh,
[1255.20 --> 1255.88]  I don't know.
[1255.94 --> 1256.26]  It's just,
[1256.44 --> 1257.42]  he never takes off
[1257.42 --> 1258.20]  his helmet in the game.
[1258.68 --> 1259.88]  So if they're doing that,
[1260.22 --> 1261.20]  what else are they doing?
[1262.12 --> 1263.30]  Probably stuff that's dumb.
[1263.58 --> 1263.90]  Yeah.
[1264.22 --> 1265.02]  So I'm just not gonna
[1265.02 --> 1265.72]  waste my time.
[1265.90 --> 1266.78]  In the first episode.
[1266.88 --> 1267.12]  Really?
[1267.32 --> 1267.80]  He takes off
[1267.80 --> 1268.62]  the first episode?
[1269.54 --> 1270.66]  Like they probably thought
[1270.66 --> 1271.24]  this was gonna be
[1271.24 --> 1272.66]  some huge payoff for the fans
[1272.66 --> 1273.38]  and it's just like,
[1273.62 --> 1273.90]  no.
[1274.72 --> 1275.60]  Yeah, you don't understand.
[1275.86 --> 1277.20]  Master Chief is
[1277.20 --> 1278.86]  the guy in the helmet.
[1278.98 --> 1279.22]  Yeah.
[1279.68 --> 1280.76]  That's the whole thing.
[1280.80 --> 1281.10]  Yeah.
[1281.40 --> 1282.36]  He's a space marine
[1282.36 --> 1282.90]  in a helmet.
[1283.08 --> 1283.32]  Yeah.
[1284.20 --> 1285.24]  Don't take it off.
[1285.68 --> 1286.50]  The only time
[1286.50 --> 1287.30]  he takes it off,
[1287.72 --> 1289.24]  you just,
[1289.44 --> 1289.76]  you like,
[1289.82 --> 1290.76]  I think you hear him
[1290.76 --> 1291.24]  take it off.
[1291.30 --> 1292.20]  You don't actually see him
[1292.20 --> 1293.24]  and people,
[1293.92 --> 1295.66]  I don't know if it was
[1295.66 --> 1296.58]  on like PC or something,
[1296.66 --> 1297.28]  they found some way
[1297.28 --> 1298.04]  to like no clip
[1298.04 --> 1298.68]  into the ship
[1298.68 --> 1299.24]  that he's in
[1299.24 --> 1300.46]  and he like takes
[1300.46 --> 1301.04]  the helmet off.
[1301.12 --> 1301.88]  There's an animation for it.
[1301.90 --> 1302.08]  He's just,
[1302.24 --> 1303.08]  there's just another one.
[1303.08 --> 1304.92]  That's so cool.
[1305.14 --> 1305.66]  I remember this
[1305.66 --> 1306.90]  from like forever ago
[1306.90 --> 1307.66]  and I remember
[1307.66 --> 1308.30]  when I heard that
[1308.30 --> 1308.60]  I was like,
[1308.72 --> 1309.08]  nice.
[1309.80 --> 1311.04]  Because now it's still
[1311.04 --> 1312.82]  just Master Chief,
[1313.00 --> 1313.82]  which is great.
[1313.82 --> 1316.04]  No,
[1316.24 --> 1318.06]  it does kind of seem
[1318.06 --> 1318.98]  like it's going that way.
[1319.08 --> 1319.24]  I mean,
[1319.32 --> 1320.76]  Disney has talked about
[1320.76 --> 1322.16]  how they're backtracking
[1322.16 --> 1322.90]  on the whole,
[1323.04 --> 1323.20]  yep,
[1323.28 --> 1325.22]  Disney Plus is all our stuff,
[1325.30 --> 1325.94]  only our stuff.
[1326.00 --> 1326.80]  You can't see our stuff
[1326.80 --> 1327.54]  anywhere else
[1327.54 --> 1329.82]  and they're open
[1329.82 --> 1330.90]  for business again
[1330.90 --> 1332.28]  when it comes to licensing
[1332.28 --> 1333.56]  to third party platforms
[1333.56 --> 1334.60]  and I think Netflix
[1334.60 --> 1336.26]  is still the monster.
[1336.26 --> 1338.82]  I can't remember
[1338.82 --> 1340.16]  if I said it out loud,
[1340.28 --> 1341.04]  but I'm pretty sure
[1341.04 --> 1343.18]  this is a classic Linus
[1343.18 --> 1345.34]  I told you so moment.
[1345.54 --> 1346.70]  I remember people
[1346.70 --> 1347.38]  talking about
[1347.38 --> 1348.28]  how Netflix
[1348.28 --> 1349.42]  is cracking down
[1349.42 --> 1350.36]  on password sharing,
[1350.52 --> 1351.40]  boycott, boycott,
[1351.52 --> 1351.96]  they're never going
[1351.96 --> 1352.52]  to survive the,
[1353.44 --> 1353.80]  yeah.
[1354.16 --> 1354.60]  With two,
[1354.82 --> 1357.22]  almost 300 million subscribers.
[1357.42 --> 1358.72]  They like immediately
[1358.72 --> 1360.82]  saw a huge boost
[1360.82 --> 1361.62]  in subscriptions
[1361.62 --> 1362.56]  once they started
[1362.56 --> 1363.14]  cracking down
[1363.14 --> 1364.08]  on password sharing.
[1364.08 --> 1366.06]  I'm a little surprised
[1366.06 --> 1366.84]  to see them
[1366.84 --> 1368.90]  come back again
[1368.90 --> 1370.00]  so soon
[1370.00 --> 1370.74]  after getting
[1370.74 --> 1372.56]  so many more signups
[1372.56 --> 1374.06]  and increasing price
[1374.06 --> 1375.34]  and this is something
[1375.34 --> 1376.46]  that I've talked about
[1376.46 --> 1377.38]  before on the show
[1377.38 --> 1378.36]  so this isn't going to be
[1378.36 --> 1379.60]  a super long topic.
[1379.82 --> 1379.92]  They,
[1381.04 --> 1382.12]  I don't think
[1382.12 --> 1383.52]  they increased the price.
[1383.94 --> 1384.12]  Well,
[1384.16 --> 1385.38]  they're discontinuing
[1385.38 --> 1387.22]  the $12 ad-free plan.
[1388.00 --> 1388.48]  Like,
[1388.56 --> 1389.28]  that sucks.
[1389.44 --> 1390.42]  But there's a $7
[1390.42 --> 1392.24]  monthly plan.
[1392.24 --> 1393.28]  But that's with ads.
[1394.08 --> 1394.56]  Oh,
[1394.64 --> 1395.20]  I see what's going on.
[1395.20 --> 1395.36]  No,
[1395.44 --> 1396.26]  it's going to cost you,
[1396.26 --> 1397.12]  it's going to cost you
[1397.12 --> 1398.76]  $15.50
[1398.76 --> 1400.16]  for what you used
[1400.16 --> 1401.52]  to pay $12 for.
[1401.56 --> 1402.60]  So I'm not a subscriber.
[1402.76 --> 1403.62]  And you know what?
[1403.64 --> 1404.06]  I don't subscribe
[1404.06 --> 1404.90]  to any of the platforms.
[1405.10 --> 1405.40]  Look,
[1405.50 --> 1405.88]  I don't,
[1405.88 --> 1406.54]  I don't work
[1406.54 --> 1407.58]  in government policy.
[1408.06 --> 1408.30]  Okay?
[1408.74 --> 1409.92]  So I'm sure
[1409.92 --> 1410.52]  that there are,
[1410.60 --> 1411.34]  there are challenges
[1411.34 --> 1412.36]  and there are obstacles
[1412.36 --> 1413.92]  that I don't have
[1413.92 --> 1414.88]  familiarity with.
[1415.08 --> 1415.10]  I,
[1415.32 --> 1415.94]  I,
[1416.08 --> 1416.62]  I'm going to,
[1416.68 --> 1417.14]  I'm going to say
[1417.14 --> 1417.68]  that up front.
[1418.28 --> 1421.00]  But I do not understand
[1421.00 --> 1423.34]  given that this is something
[1423.34 --> 1424.08]  that basically
[1424.08 --> 1425.20]  every living,
[1425.40 --> 1426.12]  breathing human
[1426.12 --> 1427.22]  with a credit card
[1427.22 --> 1427.98]  has experienced
[1427.98 --> 1428.68]  at some point.
[1428.82 --> 1430.30]  I don't understand
[1430.30 --> 1432.06]  how nobody
[1432.06 --> 1433.30]  who works
[1433.30 --> 1434.12]  within
[1434.12 --> 1436.06]  these large
[1436.06 --> 1437.20]  governments
[1437.20 --> 1439.14]  has ever thought,
[1439.52 --> 1440.46]  you know,
[1440.66 --> 1442.34]  when I sign up
[1442.34 --> 1442.98]  for something
[1442.98 --> 1444.48]  and we agree
[1444.48 --> 1445.24]  on a price
[1445.24 --> 1446.52]  and we agree
[1446.52 --> 1447.46]  on a product
[1447.46 --> 1448.18]  or service,
[1448.18 --> 1450.36]  that should be
[1450.36 --> 1450.96]  the deal.
[1451.90 --> 1453.00]  You should not
[1453.00 --> 1453.78]  be able to
[1453.78 --> 1455.00]  unilaterally say
[1455.00 --> 1456.40]  that is not
[1456.40 --> 1457.40]  the deal anymore.
[1457.72 --> 1458.32]  Hold on,
[1458.40 --> 1458.98]  are they though?
[1459.42 --> 1459.82]  I'm,
[1459.82 --> 1460.14]  I'm genuinely,
[1460.26 --> 1460.42]  okay,
[1460.50 --> 1460.84]  so how,
[1460.92 --> 1461.40]  how would you
[1461.40 --> 1461.96]  solve this?
[1462.42 --> 1463.12]  I would solve
[1463.12 --> 1463.80]  this by saying,
[1463.88 --> 1464.10]  look,
[1464.20 --> 1464.94]  it has to be
[1464.94 --> 1465.60]  grandfathered in.
[1467.94 --> 1468.94]  You have to,
[1468.96 --> 1469.56]  you have to
[1469.56 --> 1470.30]  grandfather in.
[1470.30 --> 1471.20]  But does that
[1471.20 --> 1472.04]  work forever?
[1472.68 --> 1473.10]  Like,
[1473.18 --> 1473.50]  okay,
[1473.66 --> 1473.98]  let's,
[1474.06 --> 1474.70]  let's use this
[1474.70 --> 1475.36]  in a float plane
[1475.36 --> 1475.84]  context,
[1475.84 --> 1476.04]  right?
[1476.06 --> 1476.54]  So we have,
[1476.54 --> 1477.66]  we have grandfathered
[1477.66 --> 1477.98]  subscribers
[1477.98 --> 1479.48]  and for a long time
[1479.48 --> 1481.16]  we have grandfathered
[1481.16 --> 1481.92]  subscribers from
[1481.92 --> 1482.94]  2017.
[1483.76 --> 1484.24]  Yep.
[1484.44 --> 1484.76]  Wait,
[1485.06 --> 1485.44]  do we have,
[1485.92 --> 1486.42]  do we have grant?
[1486.66 --> 1487.42]  We might have
[1487.42 --> 1487.96]  grandfathered
[1487.96 --> 1488.52]  subscribers from
[1488.52 --> 1489.84]  2016 technically.
[1490.38 --> 1491.78]  It's the $3 tier,
[1491.84 --> 1491.96]  right?
[1491.98 --> 1492.78]  We've never increased
[1492.78 --> 1493.04]  it.
[1493.54 --> 1494.34]  And I,
[1494.38 --> 1495.10]  I like that.
[1495.16 --> 1495.52]  That's cool.
[1495.60 --> 1495.82]  That's,
[1495.88 --> 1496.64]  that's good stuff.
[1496.74 --> 1496.98]  Whatever.
[1497.08 --> 1497.56]  Sounds cool.
[1497.56 --> 1498.44]  Um,
[1498.70 --> 1500.96]  but what if it's
[1500.96 --> 1502.38]  like 30 years from
[1502.38 --> 1502.58]  now?
[1502.66 --> 1503.34]  So here's the
[1503.34 --> 1504.06]  solution to that
[1504.06 --> 1505.26]  because right now
[1505.26 --> 1505.90]  they want to eat
[1505.90 --> 1506.62]  their cake and have
[1506.62 --> 1507.00]  it too.
[1507.30 --> 1508.66]  If they want to
[1508.66 --> 1509.84]  have certain,
[1510.16 --> 1510.82]  if they want to
[1510.82 --> 1511.84]  have a fixed term
[1511.84 --> 1512.64]  on this agreement,
[1512.64 --> 1513.90]  then they need to
[1513.90 --> 1514.58]  stop fucking
[1514.58 --> 1515.36]  charging my credit
[1515.36 --> 1516.58]  card at the end
[1516.58 --> 1517.12]  of that term.
[1517.48 --> 1517.92]  Okay.
[1518.04 --> 1518.82]  It should be like
[1518.82 --> 1519.54]  anything else.
[1519.54 --> 1520.14]  So if you want to
[1520.14 --> 1520.40]  change,
[1520.48 --> 1520.76]  if you want to
[1520.76 --> 1521.52]  update the pricing,
[1521.52 --> 1522.48]  you have to cancel
[1522.48 --> 1523.10]  all current
[1523.10 --> 1523.58]  subscription.
[1523.72 --> 1524.12]  Exactly.
[1524.42 --> 1524.56]  Yeah.
[1524.64 --> 1525.08]  And there's going
[1525.08 --> 1525.70]  to be a lot of
[1525.70 --> 1526.40]  attrition there
[1526.40 --> 1527.34]  because the
[1527.34 --> 1528.38]  friction to get
[1528.38 --> 1529.18]  someone to
[1529.18 --> 1530.90]  re-sign up for
[1530.90 --> 1531.24]  someone,
[1531.32 --> 1531.96]  something is
[1531.96 --> 1532.82]  extremely high.
[1532.94 --> 1533.50]  Here's a spicy
[1533.50 --> 1534.20]  question for you.
[1534.20 --> 1534.36]  Sure.
[1534.88 --> 1535.64]  We've talked on
[1535.64 --> 1536.26]  Wancho how about
[1536.26 --> 1536.86]  how there is a
[1536.86 --> 1537.66]  possibility that
[1537.66 --> 1538.56]  we'll be increasing
[1538.56 --> 1539.76]  full plane prices.
[1540.26 --> 1540.80]  I don't think that's
[1540.80 --> 1541.34]  a possibility.
[1541.50 --> 1541.90]  I think that's
[1541.90 --> 1542.32]  something that's
[1542.32 --> 1542.60]  happening.
[1543.00 --> 1543.46]  And we'd be
[1543.46 --> 1543.78]  grand,
[1544.14 --> 1544.82]  it just hasn't
[1544.82 --> 1545.24]  happened yet,
[1545.30 --> 1545.66]  which is why I
[1545.66 --> 1546.16]  word it that way.
[1546.26 --> 1546.40]  Right.
[1546.60 --> 1547.00]  Um,
[1547.52 --> 1548.38]  and we'd be,
[1548.50 --> 1548.84]  I guess,
[1548.92 --> 1549.06]  yeah,
[1549.12 --> 1549.40]  we'd be
[1549.40 --> 1550.24]  grandfathering people.
[1550.34 --> 1550.62]  Of course.
[1550.74 --> 1550.90]  Okay.
[1551.02 --> 1551.84]  So if you wanted
[1551.84 --> 1553.00]  to increase the price
[1553.00 --> 1554.22]  on say the $3 tier
[1554.22 --> 1555.56]  in 30 years or
[1555.56 --> 1555.90]  whatever,
[1555.90 --> 1556.92]  um,
[1557.22 --> 1557.92]  you would cancel
[1557.92 --> 1558.74]  all their
[1558.74 --> 1559.20]  subscriptions,
[1559.20 --> 1562.38]  but then allow them
[1562.38 --> 1563.36]  to subscribe at like a
[1563.36 --> 1564.06]  now increased,
[1564.18 --> 1565.22]  but still grandfathered,
[1565.22 --> 1566.24]  discounted something.
[1567.90 --> 1568.88]  Like how would you?
[1568.88 --> 1569.70]  I wouldn't do that
[1569.70 --> 1570.06]  either.
[1570.26 --> 1570.58]  Okay.
[1570.58 --> 1571.58]  Cause that's lame.
[1572.04 --> 1572.66]  So you just,
[1572.78 --> 1573.28]  it's not cool.
[1573.38 --> 1574.24]  You just grandfathered them
[1574.24 --> 1575.06]  for literally ever.
[1575.22 --> 1575.46]  Yeah.
[1575.50 --> 1576.40]  Or if it's not
[1576.40 --> 1577.26]  sustainable anymore,
[1577.26 --> 1578.20]  then I guess we
[1578.20 --> 1579.12]  closed down the service.
[1582.38 --> 1582.78]  Well,
[1582.86 --> 1583.66]  look,
[1583.82 --> 1584.46]  it's not like,
[1584.56 --> 1585.64]  it's not like these
[1585.64 --> 1586.68]  changing different product.
[1586.80 --> 1588.82]  It is a different product,
[1588.94 --> 1590.34]  but it's very related.
[1590.60 --> 1590.76]  Yeah.
[1590.76 --> 1590.96]  It's,
[1590.96 --> 1592.34]  it's pretty darn related.
[1592.48 --> 1593.32]  Floatplane has a lot
[1593.32 --> 1594.18]  of the same,
[1594.18 --> 1595.10]  um,
[1595.30 --> 1596.80]  dynamics that something
[1596.80 --> 1597.82]  like a Netflix does.
[1597.92 --> 1598.60]  We pay for bandwidth,
[1598.72 --> 1599.42]  we pay for storage,
[1599.48 --> 1600.34]  we pay for development,
[1600.34 --> 1601.66]  we pay for content production.
[1601.88 --> 1603.42]  You guys pay us for
[1603.42 --> 1604.86]  all of those things.
[1605.20 --> 1605.42]  Yeah.
[1605.56 --> 1606.12]  Like when,
[1606.14 --> 1606.74]  when I mentioned,
[1606.82 --> 1607.40]  like I don't subscribe
[1607.40 --> 1608.34]  to any of those platforms,
[1608.48 --> 1610.62]  I meant things like Netflix.
[1610.62 --> 1611.38]  So like Netflix,
[1611.58 --> 1614.20]  Disney plus Amazon prime video,
[1614.32 --> 1614.50]  whatever,
[1614.58 --> 1615.22]  those types of things.
[1615.48 --> 1615.88]  Um,
[1615.88 --> 1618.08]  I do technically like I,
[1618.14 --> 1621.28]  I support at least one.
[1621.34 --> 1622.14]  I don't remember how many
[1622.14 --> 1623.54]  creators on floatplane
[1623.54 --> 1624.90]  where I'm technically paying
[1624.90 --> 1625.90]  for the full plane subscription.
[1625.90 --> 1626.52]  That is a thing.
[1626.90 --> 1629.84]  And I also support,
[1629.84 --> 1631.12]  I have at least one
[1631.12 --> 1632.20]  Patreon thing
[1632.20 --> 1633.64]  where I'm supporting a creator.
[1633.64 --> 1634.24]  Like I,
[1634.30 --> 1635.62]  I've support creators individually.
[1635.62 --> 1638.26]  I don't support the Omega video platforms.
[1638.38 --> 1638.76]  They're different.
[1638.98 --> 1640.08]  But here's the thing,
[1640.12 --> 1640.30]  right?
[1640.30 --> 1642.28]  Like if they don't like that,
[1643.06 --> 1644.34]  it was an option
[1644.34 --> 1645.94]  to not do it.
[1645.94 --> 1646.50]  Like,
[1646.54 --> 1646.82]  okay,
[1646.90 --> 1647.20]  look at,
[1647.20 --> 1648.24]  look at something like Uber.
[1648.24 --> 1648.80]  It's,
[1648.88 --> 1649.60]  it's finally,
[1649.98 --> 1652.24]  people have kind of finally figured out
[1652.24 --> 1654.52]  what the Uber play was.
[1654.52 --> 1656.70]  They took a bunch of VC money.
[1657.30 --> 1660.28]  They essentially undercut the traditional,
[1660.54 --> 1661.32]  and to be clear,
[1661.38 --> 1662.36]  there were a lot of problems
[1662.36 --> 1664.18]  and a lot of corruption
[1664.18 --> 1665.78]  in the cab industry,
[1665.78 --> 1667.54]  at least here in North America anyway.
[1668.16 --> 1668.44]  And,
[1668.44 --> 1669.58]  um,
[1670.36 --> 1672.20]  and other sort of just like private,
[1672.38 --> 1672.72]  uh,
[1672.72 --> 1674.40]  private transportation companies.
[1674.58 --> 1675.50]  So they came in,
[1675.62 --> 1677.00]  they took a bunch of VC money,
[1677.18 --> 1679.50]  they funneled it into undercutting everybody
[1679.50 --> 1681.34]  until the infrastructure
[1681.34 --> 1683.04]  and these companies decayed
[1683.04 --> 1684.02]  to the point of
[1684.02 --> 1686.06]  negligibility.
[1686.38 --> 1688.72]  And then they jacked up the rates
[1688.72 --> 1689.62]  to the point where now
[1689.62 --> 1691.60]  it cost me more to take an Uber today
[1691.60 --> 1693.24]  than it did to take a cab
[1693.24 --> 1694.08]  before they came in
[1694.08 --> 1696.76]  and disrupted these industries.
[1697.02 --> 1697.44]  Right?
[1697.90 --> 1698.26]  So,
[1699.08 --> 1699.76]  they didn't,
[1700.18 --> 1700.50]  if they,
[1700.52 --> 1702.30]  if they were to come back,
[1702.34 --> 1702.68]  you know,
[1702.78 --> 1703.16]  uh,
[1703.16 --> 1704.22]  10 years later,
[1704.22 --> 1704.50]  right?
[1704.58 --> 1705.30]  And say,
[1705.50 --> 1706.06]  well,
[1706.08 --> 1707.72]  this is totally unsustainable.
[1708.14 --> 1708.38]  It's like,
[1708.46 --> 1708.58]  well,
[1708.64 --> 1708.82]  well,
[1708.82 --> 1709.00]  yeah,
[1709.00 --> 1710.14]  but you had an option
[1710.14 --> 1711.58]  to not
[1711.58 --> 1713.74]  just dump money
[1713.74 --> 1715.96]  in what is essentially
[1715.96 --> 1717.84]  an anti-competitive manner,
[1717.84 --> 1718.76]  uh,
[1718.80 --> 1719.62]  into this
[1719.62 --> 1719.98]  to,
[1719.98 --> 1721.42]  to kneecap your competitors.
[1721.54 --> 1721.90]  That was,
[1722.00 --> 1723.68]  that was totally an option.
[1723.96 --> 1725.26]  You could have run the business
[1725.26 --> 1726.38]  and built it
[1726.38 --> 1727.46]  in a sustainable fashion
[1727.46 --> 1728.32]  in the first place.
[1728.42 --> 1729.44]  And I get that
[1729.44 --> 1730.88]  that's not what your investors want.
[1731.00 --> 1731.82]  I get that that's not
[1731.82 --> 1733.06]  the Silicon Valley model,
[1733.24 --> 1734.04]  but guess what?
[1734.06 --> 1735.52]  I don't feel bad for you.
[1736.04 --> 1737.46]  That was a choice.
[1737.46 --> 1739.30]  Nobody had a gun
[1739.30 --> 1740.00]  to your head
[1740.00 --> 1740.76]  and said,
[1740.88 --> 1741.98]  you have to,
[1742.10 --> 1742.98]  you have to charge
[1742.98 --> 1744.72]  razor thin margins
[1744.72 --> 1745.80]  on this
[1745.80 --> 1747.12]  and grow your,
[1747.20 --> 1748.18]  your install base
[1748.18 --> 1749.66]  at a breakneck speed
[1749.66 --> 1750.54]  instead of building
[1750.54 --> 1751.24]  something slowly
[1751.24 --> 1752.02]  and sustainably.
[1753.08 --> 1753.52]  So,
[1753.60 --> 1753.72]  no,
[1753.92 --> 1754.12]  no,
[1754.18 --> 1754.36]  I don't,
[1754.36 --> 1755.18]  I don't feel bad.
[1755.26 --> 1755.86]  I don't care.
[1755.86 --> 1760.40]  Yeah,
[1760.52 --> 1761.20]  Electro Bot says,
[1761.28 --> 1761.34]  yeah,
[1761.42 --> 1762.16]  same thing Airbnb.
[1762.48 --> 1763.20]  It's more expensive
[1763.20 --> 1764.24]  and a worse experience
[1764.24 --> 1764.98]  than a hotel now.
[1765.44 --> 1765.68]  It's like,
[1765.72 --> 1765.86]  you're,
[1765.92 --> 1766.54]  you're actually,
[1766.88 --> 1767.70]  a lot of the times
[1767.70 --> 1768.78]  better off to go to a hotel
[1768.78 --> 1769.52]  where they will clean
[1769.52 --> 1770.28]  the towels for you.
[1770.76 --> 1771.08]  Yeah,
[1771.10 --> 1771.70]  I feel that way.
[1772.12 --> 1773.04]  I'm a flanker said,
[1773.12 --> 1773.74]  the difference is that
[1773.74 --> 1774.58]  yours is in-house
[1774.58 --> 1775.40]  without being required
[1775.40 --> 1776.04]  to compete,
[1776.32 --> 1778.26]  complete multiple compliance
[1778.26 --> 1779.72]  in multiple nations.
[1779.84 --> 1780.48]  We do actually.
[1780.60 --> 1780.90]  Actually,
[1780.98 --> 1781.16]  we do.
[1781.34 --> 1782.32]  We absolutely have to do that.
[1782.32 --> 1782.76]  And it's like,
[1782.84 --> 1783.02]  man,
[1783.08 --> 1784.64]  tax is so complicated
[1784.64 --> 1786.64]  for a multinational
[1786.64 --> 1787.48]  online platform
[1787.48 --> 1788.12]  like Flowplane.
[1788.34 --> 1789.46]  It's actually a really
[1789.46 --> 1790.32]  stupid project
[1790.32 --> 1790.92]  that we should have
[1790.92 --> 1791.74]  never started.
[1792.00 --> 1792.14]  Yeah.
[1793.30 --> 1794.54]  It's kind of sick though.
[1795.12 --> 1795.56]  Hey,
[1795.68 --> 1796.92]  now that we got it.
[1798.14 --> 1798.30]  Hey,
[1798.86 --> 1799.26]  if I,
[1799.42 --> 1800.66]  if anyone want to license
[1800.66 --> 1801.68]  some really cool tech?
[1802.00 --> 1802.38]  I had,
[1802.48 --> 1803.74]  I had very good,
[1803.82 --> 1804.44]  very intelligent,
[1804.58 --> 1805.88]  very connected friends of mine
[1805.88 --> 1808.02]  go through a lot of effort
[1808.02 --> 1808.86]  to try to convince me
[1808.86 --> 1809.82]  not to do it at the time
[1809.82 --> 1810.56]  and I did it anyways.
[1810.68 --> 1811.32]  It is what it is.
[1811.66 --> 1812.06]  Um,
[1812.06 --> 1814.20]  they were right,
[1814.32 --> 1815.16]  but we're here now
[1815.16 --> 1815.68]  and it's good.
[1815.78 --> 1816.24]  I like it.
[1816.62 --> 1816.98]  Um,
[1817.40 --> 1817.68]  okay.
[1817.68 --> 1818.24]  I'm going to continue
[1818.24 --> 1818.60]  his message.
[1818.88 --> 1819.88]  I'm not crying for Netflix,
[1819.88 --> 1820.86]  but they need the ability
[1820.86 --> 1821.66]  to change pricing.
[1821.76 --> 1822.70]  The cost should absolutely
[1822.70 --> 1824.70]  be that if it's,
[1824.70 --> 1825.22]  uh,
[1825.54 --> 1826.36]  over inflation,
[1826.36 --> 1827.32]  then you have the ability
[1827.32 --> 1828.54]  to cancel without a penalty.
[1829.44 --> 1829.84]  Yeah,
[1829.86 --> 1830.74]  but inflation is such
[1830.74 --> 1832.16]  an arbitrary number anyway.
[1832.38 --> 1833.90]  Netflix has zero contract length.
[1834.04 --> 1834.78]  So technically you can
[1834.78 --> 1835.82]  leave whenever that's,
[1835.82 --> 1837.44]  it's way worse in telecoms.
[1837.50 --> 1838.02]  So that,
[1838.10 --> 1839.10]  that was my one point
[1839.10 --> 1840.16]  is that you can technically
[1840.16 --> 1840.80]  leave whenever.
[1840.80 --> 1841.30]  So like,
[1841.30 --> 1842.84]  especially on monthly to monthly,
[1842.90 --> 1843.94]  like your contract is really
[1843.94 --> 1844.84]  up at the end of the month.
[1844.98 --> 1845.12]  If they,
[1845.24 --> 1846.06]  if they change,
[1846.14 --> 1846.80]  like if you subscribe
[1846.80 --> 1847.48]  for a year,
[1847.48 --> 1848.96]  um,
[1848.96 --> 1850.26]  and they like change it
[1850.26 --> 1851.38]  and then bill your card
[1851.38 --> 1852.30]  because they're like,
[1852.30 --> 1853.42]  well,
[1853.42 --> 1854.18]  we changed our price.
[1854.24 --> 1855.20]  That's total BS.
[1855.20 --> 1856.20]  If you subscribe for a year
[1856.20 --> 1856.56]  and they're like,
[1856.56 --> 1857.32]  when it renews,
[1857.32 --> 1858.22]  it will be more expensive.
[1858.40 --> 1858.54]  Yep.
[1858.54 --> 1860.52]  That's why it's legal.
[1860.76 --> 1861.04]  Yeah.
[1861.24 --> 1862.86]  But what it isn't is cool.
[1863.90 --> 1864.30]  Yeah.
[1864.36 --> 1865.32]  And that's my problem.
[1865.48 --> 1866.70]  It's definitely not cool,
[1866.70 --> 1867.56]  but I don't know about it
[1867.56 --> 1868.14]  being illegal.
[1868.30 --> 1868.44]  Like,
[1868.50 --> 1868.94]  oh man,
[1869.04 --> 1869.20]  yeah,
[1869.28 --> 1871.84]  sometimes it could be.
[1872.14 --> 1873.10]  Do you see the,
[1873.10 --> 1873.28]  uh,
[1873.28 --> 1874.10]  the recent kerfuffle
[1874.10 --> 1875.18]  over Microsoft
[1875.18 --> 1876.52]  and their Game Pass changes?
[1876.56 --> 1877.74]  So we talked about this last week,
[1877.74 --> 1878.84]  how prices went up
[1878.84 --> 1879.74]  and everything was confusing
[1879.74 --> 1880.76]  and they're kind of gating
[1880.76 --> 1882.52]  access to the new car.
[1882.52 --> 1883.08]  that,
[1883.38 --> 1884.98]  that should actually,
[1885.10 --> 1885.50]  because they,
[1885.56 --> 1886.42]  they announced it.
[1886.42 --> 1888.08]  The FTC is not
[1888.08 --> 1889.74]  le impress right now.
[1889.74 --> 1890.52]  I think that is good
[1890.52 --> 1891.10]  because when,
[1891.22 --> 1892.18]  I brought this up
[1892.18 --> 1892.66]  during the show,
[1892.72 --> 1893.38]  but they announced
[1893.38 --> 1893.90]  that it was going to be
[1893.90 --> 1894.34]  game,
[1895.16 --> 1896.30]  day one Game Pass
[1896.30 --> 1896.94]  for everyone.
[1897.46 --> 1897.80]  Yeah.
[1897.80 --> 1899.16]  And then they pulled that back.
[1899.30 --> 1899.46]  Yeah.
[1899.46 --> 1900.52]  And people might have subscribed
[1900.52 --> 1901.40]  because of that.
[1901.54 --> 1903.04]  So that's a totally different thing
[1903.04 --> 1903.70]  in my opinion.
[1904.04 --> 1904.20]  Yeah.
[1904.42 --> 1904.62]  Yeah.
[1904.62 --> 1905.38]  That's rough.
[1905.64 --> 1906.42]  That's actually bad.
[1906.52 --> 1906.88]  Yeah.
[1907.76 --> 1908.24]  So,
[1908.38 --> 1908.78]  uh,
[1908.78 --> 1909.88]  I mean,
[1909.92 --> 1910.70]  at this point,
[1910.96 --> 1912.46]  Activision and Microsoft
[1912.46 --> 1914.40]  are like integrated.
[1914.96 --> 1915.38]  Um,
[1915.40 --> 1915.92]  but the,
[1915.92 --> 1916.14]  the,
[1916.14 --> 1917.02]  the FTC is basically
[1917.02 --> 1917.68]  looking at it going,
[1917.78 --> 1917.94]  okay,
[1918.56 --> 1919.94]  you guys said this was going
[1919.94 --> 1921.96]  to be a super huggy muggy,
[1921.96 --> 1923.14]  nice acquisition.
[1923.14 --> 1924.26]  And then you came in
[1924.26 --> 1926.88]  and laid a bunch of people off.
[1927.18 --> 1930.26]  And now you're going back
[1930.26 --> 1931.02]  on your promises
[1931.02 --> 1932.46]  that this is all about
[1932.46 --> 1933.04]  so,
[1933.04 --> 1934.52]  so very much content
[1934.52 --> 1935.26]  for gamers
[1935.26 --> 1936.96]  and everyone's going to get
[1936.96 --> 1938.36]  day one access to call.
[1938.46 --> 1941.04]  The big question for me though,
[1941.12 --> 1942.32]  is who,
[1942.32 --> 1943.08]  who the f**k cares?
[1943.52 --> 1944.54]  How about just don't play
[1944.54 --> 1945.08]  call of duty?
[1945.64 --> 1945.90]  Yeah.
[1946.24 --> 1946.86]  Gamers though,
[1946.92 --> 1948.52]  you guys have no discipline
[1948.52 --> 1949.50]  and look,
[1949.74 --> 1950.52]  I'm not trying to,
[1950.60 --> 1951.24]  I'm not trying to just,
[1951.46 --> 1952.56]  amazing topic transition.
[1953.54 --> 1953.94]  Holy,
[1954.36 --> 1955.30]  I'm going to interrupt
[1955.30 --> 1956.16]  the topic transition
[1956.16 --> 1957.18]  because it was so good.
[1957.28 --> 1958.36]  That's ridiculous.
[1958.60 --> 1958.90]  I even,
[1959.00 --> 1959.96]  I know where you're going
[1959.96 --> 1961.08]  and that's nuts.
[1961.70 --> 1962.14]  Thank you.
[1962.22 --> 1963.34]  What the heck,
[1963.46 --> 1963.70]  man?
[1963.78 --> 1964.74]  I'm not bringing this up
[1964.74 --> 1965.70]  and lecturing you guys
[1965.70 --> 1966.34]  for no reason.
[1966.34 --> 1967.62]  I'm doing it
[1967.62 --> 1969.56]  because a recent survey
[1969.56 --> 1972.04]  of 5,000 American adults
[1972.04 --> 1973.14]  who play video games
[1973.14 --> 1977.24]  found that 82% of them
[1977.24 --> 1978.26]  said they had made
[1978.26 --> 1979.18]  an in-game purchase
[1979.18 --> 1980.54]  in a free-to-play game,
[1980.68 --> 1982.12]  not ever,
[1982.68 --> 1984.82]  in the last year.
[1985.88 --> 1986.34]  82%.
[1986.34 --> 1986.94]  82%.
[1986.94 --> 1988.34]  It's literally,
[1988.72 --> 1989.60]  it is literally,
[1989.92 --> 1990.24]  okay,
[1990.68 --> 1991.38]  you guys,
[1991.88 --> 1992.84]  take your two,
[1992.98 --> 1994.16]  take your two hands,
[1994.60 --> 1994.92]  okay?
[1995.34 --> 1996.16]  Take your
[1996.16 --> 1998.08]  two feet
[1998.08 --> 1999.38]  and you won't need
[1999.38 --> 2000.28]  your fifth appendage,
[2000.48 --> 2001.06]  okay?
[2004.34 --> 2005.46]  You will,
[2005.60 --> 2005.86]  yes.
[2006.18 --> 2007.70]  And if you have anything else
[2007.70 --> 2008.34]  that's pointy,
[2008.46 --> 2008.90]  point it.
[2010.08 --> 2011.90]  Four of the five things
[2011.90 --> 2012.92]  you're pointing at
[2012.92 --> 2015.96]  bought a microtransaction.
[2016.34 --> 2020.58]  in the last year.
[2021.30 --> 2022.52]  Oh my goodness.
[2023.36 --> 2024.66]  And Salmo says,
[2024.74 --> 2025.32]  right here,
[2025.40 --> 2025.96]  no shame.
[2026.32 --> 2026.98]  But it's like,
[2027.04 --> 2027.78]  we sit here
[2027.78 --> 2028.68]  and we complain
[2028.68 --> 2029.32]  about the
[2029.32 --> 2030.84]  in-ification of gaming
[2030.84 --> 2034.66]  and 82%
[2034.66 --> 2037.98]  are directly contributing.
[2038.14 --> 2038.64]  I don't mean
[2038.64 --> 2039.82]  directly contributing
[2039.82 --> 2040.30]  like,
[2040.46 --> 2041.04]  like,
[2041.12 --> 2041.62]  they're,
[2041.62 --> 2041.96]  like,
[2042.40 --> 2044.26]  passively standing by
[2044.26 --> 2045.16]  or they're,
[2045.16 --> 2045.74]  or they're
[2045.74 --> 2047.56]  pirating games
[2047.56 --> 2047.96]  that,
[2048.02 --> 2048.86]  that reject
[2048.86 --> 2049.80]  the freemium
[2049.80 --> 2050.98]  business model
[2050.98 --> 2051.66]  instead of
[2051.66 --> 2052.98]  contributing that money
[2052.98 --> 2054.08]  to the developers
[2054.08 --> 2055.34]  that continue to invest
[2055.34 --> 2055.76]  in these games.
[2055.96 --> 2057.10]  I am talking
[2057.10 --> 2059.26]  giving money
[2059.26 --> 2060.46]  to the people
[2060.46 --> 2061.58]  who develop
[2061.58 --> 2062.56]  programs
[2062.56 --> 2063.78]  to extract
[2063.78 --> 2064.50]  as much of it
[2064.50 --> 2065.30]  as possible,
[2065.30 --> 2066.30]  who literally
[2066.30 --> 2067.10]  call you
[2067.10 --> 2068.24]  f***ing whales.
[2068.24 --> 2068.98]  I mean,
[2069.06 --> 2070.08]  who would do that?
[2071.48 --> 2071.74]  Okay,
[2071.78 --> 2072.52]  we had an entire
[2072.52 --> 2073.20]  LAN event
[2073.20 --> 2073.56]  for,
[2073.64 --> 2073.90]  for,
[2074.02 --> 2074.68]  for our whales.
[2074.80 --> 2075.56]  We love our whales.
[2075.94 --> 2076.60]  I think it's higher.
[2077.34 --> 2077.94]  Higher than what?
[2078.32 --> 2078.72]  82%.
[2078.72 --> 2078.84]  Oh,
[2078.88 --> 2079.32]  that's the ones
[2079.32 --> 2080.14]  that admitted to it.
[2080.28 --> 2080.44]  Yes.
[2080.78 --> 2081.64]  Any survey
[2081.64 --> 2082.16]  that's like,
[2082.20 --> 2083.18]  I don't know,
[2083.24 --> 2083.82]  how many times,
[2083.82 --> 2084.56]  it's gotta be over 90.
[2084.56 --> 2085.14]  How many times
[2085.14 --> 2085.98]  do you f*** a day
[2085.98 --> 2086.60]  or whatever,
[2086.82 --> 2086.92]  right?
[2086.92 --> 2087.08]  Like,
[2087.08 --> 2087.84]  it's always gonna,
[2087.84 --> 2088.46]  it's always gonna
[2088.46 --> 2089.34]  underestimate
[2089.34 --> 2090.16]  if it's something
[2090.16 --> 2090.74]  embarrassing.
[2091.02 --> 2091.16]  Yeah.
[2092.00 --> 2092.26]  It's,
[2092.30 --> 2092.82]  it's gotta be
[2092.82 --> 2093.46]  higher than 82.
[2093.46 --> 2096.28]  Some commentators
[2096.28 --> 2096.96]  have suggested,
[2097.08 --> 2098.00]  come back to my notes now,
[2098.56 --> 2099.46]  that this kind of data
[2099.46 --> 2100.16]  might indicate
[2100.16 --> 2101.24]  why the freemium model
[2101.24 --> 2102.16]  has become so popular.
[2102.24 --> 2102.80]  This is a note.
[2103.44 --> 2103.68]  Uh,
[2103.70 --> 2103.94]  okay,
[2104.02 --> 2104.16]  well,
[2104.20 --> 2104.42]  anyway,
[2104.74 --> 2105.46]  it might likewise
[2105.46 --> 2106.32]  indicate that
[2106.32 --> 2107.48]  at least some of the people
[2107.48 --> 2108.86]  critical of this
[2108.86 --> 2109.90]  monetization strategy
[2109.90 --> 2110.82]  are themselves
[2110.82 --> 2112.28]  paying into it.
[2112.86 --> 2113.34]  Further,
[2113.96 --> 2115.92]  around 45%
[2115.92 --> 2116.70]  of respondents
[2116.70 --> 2117.28]  claimed
[2117.28 --> 2118.86]  that they didn't
[2118.86 --> 2120.40]  mind watching ads
[2120.40 --> 2121.18]  that offered
[2121.18 --> 2122.52]  in-game rewards.
[2122.84 --> 2123.14]  Ah!
[2123.46 --> 2123.58]  Ah!
[2124.58 --> 2125.92]  This is how conditioned
[2125.92 --> 2126.42]  we are,
[2126.48 --> 2126.66]  Luke.
[2127.06 --> 2127.50]  I don't,
[2127.66 --> 2129.08]  the interesting thing
[2129.08 --> 2129.74]  to me is like,
[2129.80 --> 2130.62]  we'll just take it.
[2130.92 --> 2131.20]  I've never,
[2131.20 --> 2131.94]  we've all been playing
[2131.94 --> 2133.24]  Bend Over Simulator
[2133.24 --> 2135.06]  and we didn't even know it.
[2135.74 --> 2136.06]  I've,
[2136.06 --> 2136.78]  I've never actually
[2136.78 --> 2138.26]  disagreed with all of it.
[2138.66 --> 2139.10]  Um,
[2139.14 --> 2139.46]  like,
[2140.22 --> 2141.46]  I've usually used
[2141.46 --> 2141.98]  League of Legends
[2141.98 --> 2142.70]  as a model
[2142.70 --> 2143.44]  of like,
[2143.56 --> 2144.00]  uh,
[2144.24 --> 2145.60]  I haven't played in forever,
[2145.82 --> 2146.58]  so I don't know
[2146.58 --> 2147.46]  what it's like anymore.
[2147.68 --> 2148.90]  But when League of Legends
[2148.90 --> 2149.46]  first came out,
[2149.48 --> 2150.20]  it was a free game,
[2150.68 --> 2151.36]  it was really good,
[2152.06 --> 2153.28]  and there was some skins,
[2153.28 --> 2154.24]  and they weren't
[2154.24 --> 2155.04]  so expensive.
[2155.28 --> 2155.98]  I've heard there's
[2155.98 --> 2157.58]  some real expensive ones now.
[2157.70 --> 2157.80]  Yeah,
[2157.84 --> 2158.38]  wasn't there like
[2158.38 --> 2160.16]  $300 one a little while ago?
[2160.16 --> 2160.38]  Something like that,
[2160.42 --> 2160.76]  I don't know.
[2160.84 --> 2161.42]  But they were like
[2161.42 --> 2162.22]  a few bucks
[2162.22 --> 2163.34]  or something,
[2163.66 --> 2164.14]  and,
[2164.80 --> 2165.00]  you know,
[2165.04 --> 2165.86]  you support the company.
[2165.98 --> 2167.14]  And the way that I viewed it
[2167.14 --> 2167.50]  was like,
[2167.56 --> 2167.72]  okay,
[2167.78 --> 2168.38]  look at how much
[2168.38 --> 2169.18]  I play this game,
[2169.66 --> 2170.24]  look at how much
[2170.24 --> 2171.40]  I would spend on games,
[2171.40 --> 2172.82]  I'll buy a few skins
[2172.82 --> 2173.72]  to support the company
[2173.72 --> 2174.16]  because I actually
[2174.16 --> 2174.88]  really like this game,
[2174.94 --> 2175.46]  and then I'll like,
[2175.64 --> 2176.50]  I'll keep it at a very
[2176.50 --> 2177.28]  reasonable level.
[2177.44 --> 2178.04]  That's technically
[2178.04 --> 2179.00]  a microtransaction.
[2179.36 --> 2180.38]  I'm wondering like,
[2181.66 --> 2182.28]  you know,
[2182.34 --> 2182.96]  if you ask
[2182.96 --> 2184.26]  who has made
[2184.26 --> 2185.08]  a microtransaction
[2185.08 --> 2185.88]  at all,
[2186.32 --> 2187.58]  or who has made
[2187.58 --> 2188.32]  like egregious
[2188.32 --> 2189.14]  microtransactions,
[2189.26 --> 2189.70]  like I wonder
[2189.70 --> 2190.68]  if this is different.
[2191.00 --> 2191.46]  I don't know.
[2192.32 --> 2192.86]  I don't know.
[2193.34 --> 2194.38]  Like even Rocket League,
[2194.44 --> 2194.98]  that is a game
[2194.98 --> 2195.76]  that I purchased,
[2196.40 --> 2197.02]  but I played
[2197.02 --> 2198.46]  the crap out of it,
[2198.46 --> 2199.00]  and I purchased it
[2199.00 --> 2199.66]  for like $4
[2199.66 --> 2200.32]  or something
[2200.32 --> 2200.62]  because it was
[2200.62 --> 2201.42]  on a crazy sale.
[2201.74 --> 2202.10]  So I bought
[2202.10 --> 2203.00]  a couple of seasons passes
[2203.00 --> 2203.46]  because I felt
[2203.46 --> 2204.30]  like they deserved it.
[2204.84 --> 2205.32]  And then they were
[2205.32 --> 2205.98]  bought out by Epic,
[2206.06 --> 2206.42]  and I was like,
[2206.50 --> 2206.68]  whatever.
[2207.22 --> 2208.62]  Mad Economist says,
[2208.76 --> 2210.02]  nuclear hot take.
[2210.46 --> 2211.80]  I love free-to-play games
[2211.80 --> 2212.82]  with microtransactions.
[2213.20 --> 2214.00]  They allow me
[2214.00 --> 2215.14]  to sponge off of people
[2215.14 --> 2216.14]  who spend much more
[2216.14 --> 2216.70]  money on them.
[2217.64 --> 2218.52]  Sponge off of?
[2218.60 --> 2218.80]  Yeah.
[2219.96 --> 2220.28]  Like,
[2220.36 --> 2220.58]  I mean,
[2220.66 --> 2220.88]  that's,
[2221.16 --> 2222.60]  I like Halo Infinite.
[2223.04 --> 2224.32]  I have never given
[2224.32 --> 2225.74]  Microsoft a dollar for it.
[2225.88 --> 2226.58]  A lot of games,
[2226.58 --> 2226.88]  though.
[2226.98 --> 2228.20]  Somebody else paid for it,
[2228.24 --> 2228.94]  and I'm going to play it.
[2229.00 --> 2229.64]  So this is where
[2229.64 --> 2230.44]  it gets kind of funny
[2230.44 --> 2230.72]  to me.
[2230.72 --> 2231.72]  Enjoy your weird,
[2232.14 --> 2232.64]  spiky,
[2232.70 --> 2233.36]  mohawk,
[2233.60 --> 2234.18]  cringe,
[2234.30 --> 2235.10]  makes it easier
[2235.10 --> 2236.04]  to see your head
[2236.04 --> 2237.56]  cosmetic bullshit.
[2238.08 --> 2239.42]  So I agree with that
[2239.42 --> 2239.76]  fully.
[2239.94 --> 2240.14]  Yeah.
[2240.24 --> 2240.72]  I think,
[2240.86 --> 2241.08]  though,
[2241.26 --> 2242.26]  for every game
[2242.26 --> 2243.10]  like Halo Infinite,
[2243.30 --> 2243.54]  there's,
[2243.64 --> 2245.26]  and League,
[2245.76 --> 2246.94]  there's probably
[2246.94 --> 2248.72]  like four Diablo,
[2249.04 --> 2249.60]  whatever the heck
[2249.60 --> 2249.92]  that is,
[2249.98 --> 2250.50]  mobile game.
[2251.96 --> 2252.32]  Immortal.
[2252.70 --> 2253.50]  Diablo Immortal.
[2253.50 --> 2254.90]  where in a game
[2254.90 --> 2256.22]  like that,
[2256.22 --> 2258.22]  the like,
[2258.34 --> 2258.98]  I'm a sponge
[2258.98 --> 2259.48]  for the people
[2259.48 --> 2260.16]  that spend money,
[2260.42 --> 2261.10]  your content
[2261.10 --> 2263.04]  for the paying
[2263.04 --> 2264.14]  members of this game
[2264.14 --> 2264.72]  because they're just
[2264.72 --> 2265.38]  going to farm you
[2265.38 --> 2265.94]  because you are
[2265.94 --> 2266.62]  weaker than them.
[2266.92 --> 2267.40]  That's like,
[2267.62 --> 2268.44]  that's where I start
[2268.44 --> 2269.22]  to have an issue
[2269.22 --> 2270.46]  with these types of things.
[2270.46 --> 2270.62]  Well,
[2270.68 --> 2271.84]  I don't mind the games
[2271.84 --> 2272.98]  where there isn't
[2272.98 --> 2276.06]  a huge competitiveness
[2276.06 --> 2276.64]  disparity.
[2276.88 --> 2277.00]  Like,
[2277.14 --> 2277.82]  in Halo Infinite,
[2278.00 --> 2278.78]  I don't feel like
[2278.78 --> 2279.24]  I'm at a,
[2279.24 --> 2280.36]  I don't feel like
[2280.36 --> 2281.22]  I'm at a disadvantage.
[2281.52 --> 2281.60]  No.
[2281.76 --> 2282.18]  And like,
[2282.24 --> 2282.96]  we've worked with
[2282.96 --> 2284.10]  mobile games before
[2284.10 --> 2284.86]  in the past,
[2285.00 --> 2286.02]  before we tightened
[2286.02 --> 2286.78]  up our policies
[2286.78 --> 2287.40]  around them,
[2287.50 --> 2289.08]  where they are
[2289.08 --> 2291.16]  too pay to win.
[2291.90 --> 2293.08]  And so we,
[2293.14 --> 2293.40]  we,
[2293.50 --> 2294.52]  we don't anymore.
[2295.60 --> 2296.08]  Yeah.
[2298.26 --> 2298.96]  Pay to win
[2298.96 --> 2299.82]  is a tough metric
[2299.82 --> 2300.70]  in some games.
[2301.08 --> 2301.48]  Yeah.
[2301.74 --> 2302.70]  But pay for advantage,
[2302.96 --> 2303.38]  pay to win,
[2303.44 --> 2303.88]  whatever you want
[2303.88 --> 2304.32]  to call it.
[2304.36 --> 2304.70]  Like that,
[2304.80 --> 2306.32]  that being better
[2306.32 --> 2307.00]  than other players
[2307.00 --> 2307.62]  because you spent
[2307.62 --> 2308.24]  money on the game.
[2309.22 --> 2309.66]  Yeah.
[2309.66 --> 2310.70]  I think for me,
[2310.78 --> 2311.40]  it's less,
[2311.64 --> 2313.00]  it's less about
[2313.00 --> 2314.24]  can you be better
[2314.24 --> 2315.18]  by spending more?
[2315.34 --> 2316.38]  And it's more about
[2316.38 --> 2317.32]  are you worse
[2317.32 --> 2318.20]  for not spending?
[2318.76 --> 2320.62]  So if I could also
[2320.62 --> 2323.28]  grind and be just as good,
[2323.58 --> 2324.54]  I'm fine with that.
[2325.14 --> 2326.80]  But if I just can't
[2326.80 --> 2327.96]  do anything about it.
[2328.26 --> 2329.02]  Or if the grind
[2329.02 --> 2329.86]  is unreasonable.
[2330.20 --> 2330.38]  Yeah.
[2330.46 --> 2330.94]  Because what,
[2330.94 --> 2331.12]  what,
[2331.16 --> 2331.66]  what was it?
[2331.70 --> 2332.64]  Who was it that was
[2332.64 --> 2334.40]  under fire for having
[2334.40 --> 2334.84]  that?
[2336.34 --> 2336.74]  Oh,
[2336.76 --> 2337.62]  I forget what it was.
[2337.72 --> 2338.48]  There was like a series
[2338.48 --> 2339.22]  of Mordor.
[2339.46 --> 2339.84]  No,
[2339.88 --> 2340.70]  it wasn't that there
[2340.70 --> 2341.84]  was a series of challenges
[2341.84 --> 2343.32]  or something as part
[2343.32 --> 2344.40]  of their season
[2344.40 --> 2345.34]  or battle pass
[2345.34 --> 2345.60]  or like,
[2345.64 --> 2346.40]  I don't even remember,
[2346.58 --> 2347.88]  but someone did the math
[2347.88 --> 2348.72]  and there weren't,
[2348.84 --> 2350.12]  there wasn't enough hours.
[2350.36 --> 2351.26]  Like if they did
[2351.26 --> 2352.32]  absolutely nothing,
[2352.32 --> 2352.98]  but eat,
[2353.20 --> 2353.48]  sleep,
[2353.48 --> 2354.54]  and play the game,
[2354.54 --> 2355.22]  there wasn't enough
[2355.22 --> 2356.52]  hours to like earn
[2356.52 --> 2357.32]  the best item.
[2358.86 --> 2359.50]  Apparently it was
[2359.50 --> 2360.38]  Battlefront 2.
[2360.52 --> 2360.72]  Thanks,
[2360.82 --> 2361.06]  Elijah.
[2362.54 --> 2363.16]  And that was like,
[2363.20 --> 2363.62]  it was like,
[2363.70 --> 2364.20]  it was like,
[2364.40 --> 2364.70]  oh no,
[2364.72 --> 2364.80]  no,
[2364.80 --> 2365.32]  I don't even think
[2365.32 --> 2366.04]  it was Battlefront 2.
[2366.18 --> 2366.88]  Because Battlefront 2,
[2366.94 --> 2367.52]  it was like you could
[2367.52 --> 2368.66]  never earn Darth Vader
[2368.66 --> 2369.56]  or it would take like,
[2369.82 --> 2370.88]  it was an absurd amount
[2370.88 --> 2371.18]  of time.
[2371.36 --> 2371.92]  Like an absurd amount.
[2372.00 --> 2372.14]  No,
[2372.24 --> 2372.48]  it was,
[2372.56 --> 2373.38]  I think it was something,
[2373.46 --> 2374.38]  I think it was something else.
[2374.42 --> 2375.26]  It was some kind of,
[2375.58 --> 2376.56]  was it World of Warships?
[2377.26 --> 2377.82]  I don't know.
[2378.14 --> 2378.70]  It might have been
[2378.70 --> 2379.44]  World of Warships
[2379.44 --> 2380.86]  because I seem to recall
[2380.86 --> 2381.70]  it being a ship.
[2381.92 --> 2383.02]  The pride and accomplishment
[2383.02 --> 2384.10]  quote was,
[2384.10 --> 2385.50]  was Battlefront 2.
[2386.54 --> 2386.74]  Oh,
[2386.80 --> 2388.02]  sense of pride
[2388.02 --> 2388.68]  and accomplishment.
[2388.86 --> 2389.06]  Yeah.
[2390.22 --> 2391.14]  You do know
[2391.14 --> 2393.34]  that that pitch
[2393.34 --> 2394.02]  worked
[2394.02 --> 2395.60]  back when
[2395.60 --> 2396.78]  all you got was
[2396.78 --> 2397.82]  that the princess
[2397.82 --> 2399.08]  was in this castle.
[2399.08 --> 2399.82]  Like you don't,
[2400.06 --> 2401.32]  it doesn't have to be
[2401.32 --> 2401.88]  a multi,
[2402.24 --> 2402.44]  you know,
[2402.50 --> 2403.88]  hundreds of hours
[2403.88 --> 2404.60]  grind.
[2406.54 --> 2406.98]  Anyway.
[2407.94 --> 2408.76]  What are we supposed
[2408.76 --> 2409.50]  to be doing now,
[2409.56 --> 2409.72]  Dan?
[2410.86 --> 2413.10]  You're still on topic two.
[2413.18 --> 2414.12]  You've got six minutes
[2414.12 --> 2415.00]  till merch messages.
[2415.22 --> 2415.42]  Nah,
[2415.46 --> 2416.14]  let's do it now
[2416.14 --> 2417.00]  because there's going to be
[2417.00 --> 2417.74]  a few merch messages
[2417.74 --> 2418.44]  to go through today,
[2418.48 --> 2418.90]  I feel like.
[2419.50 --> 2419.76]  Sure.
[2421.88 --> 2422.28]  Okay,
[2422.38 --> 2422.76]  let's see.
[2423.12 --> 2423.28]  Hey,
[2423.42 --> 2424.54]  Land Duke and Dynas,
[2424.62 --> 2426.08]  I work in the post-production
[2426.08 --> 2427.42]  house in the film industry
[2427.42 --> 2428.70]  and I think doing a deep dive
[2428.70 --> 2430.04]  into the behind the scenes
[2430.04 --> 2430.52]  of cinemas
[2430.52 --> 2432.36]  would be a cool video.
[2432.78 --> 2433.98]  Go into DCPs
[2433.98 --> 2434.98]  and film delivery.
[2436.02 --> 2436.92]  Super cool
[2436.92 --> 2438.58]  and something that
[2438.58 --> 2439.82]  for some reason
[2439.82 --> 2440.96]  we've never really
[2440.96 --> 2441.94]  been able to
[2441.94 --> 2443.14]  nail.
[2443.42 --> 2444.46]  I don't know what it is.
[2444.92 --> 2445.60]  Our audience
[2445.60 --> 2447.06]  is super into tech
[2447.06 --> 2448.88]  but as soon as that
[2448.88 --> 2450.30]  cool processor
[2450.30 --> 2452.54]  or that cool algorithm
[2452.54 --> 2454.16]  is in a camera,
[2455.18 --> 2455.98]  it seems like
[2455.98 --> 2456.54]  people just,
[2456.90 --> 2457.18]  like,
[2457.28 --> 2458.08]  they just kind of
[2458.08 --> 2458.82]  tune out of it.
[2459.06 --> 2459.22]  Yeah.
[2459.32 --> 2459.96]  Whereas,
[2460.46 --> 2461.28]  whenever I,
[2461.38 --> 2462.94]  whenever I see an audience
[2462.94 --> 2464.46]  that's really dialed in
[2464.46 --> 2465.80]  to the behind the scenes,
[2465.80 --> 2467.60]  to the technology
[2467.60 --> 2469.52]  of film production
[2469.52 --> 2470.92]  and TV production,
[2471.48 --> 2473.30]  it almost seems like
[2473.30 --> 2474.54]  they're less of a
[2474.54 --> 2475.30]  nuts and bolts
[2475.30 --> 2477.12]  CPUs and cores
[2477.12 --> 2477.92]  and megahertz
[2477.92 --> 2479.62]  and more of like a,
[2479.62 --> 2480.68]  you know,
[2480.72 --> 2481.48]  more of like a,
[2481.48 --> 2481.84]  like a,
[2481.84 --> 2482.88]  like a lighting
[2482.88 --> 2483.92]  and,
[2483.92 --> 2487.12]  and codex
[2487.12 --> 2487.48]  and like,
[2487.50 --> 2487.92]  like it's almost,
[2488.02 --> 2489.06]  it's a different kind
[2489.06 --> 2489.62]  of geek.
[2490.06 --> 2490.68]  Like there's a,
[2490.74 --> 2491.46]  there's an overlap
[2491.46 --> 2492.30]  between us
[2492.30 --> 2492.80]  and a channel
[2492.80 --> 2493.64]  like Corridor Digital.
[2494.68 --> 2495.82]  But it's a different kind.
[2495.88 --> 2496.94]  It's not as big
[2496.94 --> 2497.84]  as I think you guys
[2497.84 --> 2498.40]  would think.
[2498.48 --> 2499.08]  Like we did a video
[2499.08 --> 2499.92]  a little while back
[2499.92 --> 2500.72]  on one of those,
[2500.76 --> 2502.44]  one of those motion
[2502.44 --> 2503.14]  capture setups
[2503.14 --> 2504.20]  with all the cameras
[2504.20 --> 2505.40]  and someone goes inside
[2505.40 --> 2506.40]  the like globe
[2506.40 --> 2507.20]  of cameras
[2507.20 --> 2508.46]  and like did fine.
[2509.26 --> 2510.24]  And the people
[2510.24 --> 2510.86]  who thought it was cool
[2510.86 --> 2511.74]  thought it was really cool
[2511.74 --> 2512.46]  and we did that,
[2512.50 --> 2513.78]  we did that studio tour
[2513.78 --> 2514.28]  of,
[2514.84 --> 2517.16]  speaking of Shadow of Mordor,
[2517.40 --> 2518.14]  what,
[2518.14 --> 2518.20]  what,
[2518.20 --> 2518.66]  what,
[2518.66 --> 2520.14]  help me,
[2520.50 --> 2521.38]  what's that studio called?
[2521.74 --> 2522.22]  Mono,
[2522.22 --> 2523.14]  Monolith?
[2523.38 --> 2524.10]  Is it Monolith?
[2527.04 --> 2528.72]  Shadow of Mordor.
[2530.60 --> 2531.42]  Monolith Productions.
[2531.46 --> 2531.56]  Yeah,
[2531.60 --> 2531.86]  Monolith,
[2531.96 --> 2532.10]  yeah.
[2532.28 --> 2532.78]  We did that,
[2532.82 --> 2533.44]  we did that tour
[2533.44 --> 2533.88]  of Monolith
[2533.88 --> 2536.20]  and that was super cool too
[2536.20 --> 2538.42]  but it was relatively niche.
[2538.54 --> 2539.02]  Like it didn't,
[2539.06 --> 2539.84]  it didn't perform,
[2540.14 --> 2541.44]  it didn't perform that well.
[2541.54 --> 2541.78]  Man,
[2541.80 --> 2543.08]  was it cool to do though.
[2543.22 --> 2543.48]  Oh,
[2543.58 --> 2543.88]  that was,
[2544.10 --> 2545.06]  that was so sick.
[2545.10 --> 2545.86]  So cool.
[2546.40 --> 2547.14]  So cool.
[2547.14 --> 2547.90]  That was really awesome.
[2549.60 --> 2550.04]  So,
[2550.20 --> 2550.92]  I don't know
[2550.92 --> 2551.52]  that that's something
[2551.52 --> 2552.22]  you're gonna see
[2552.22 --> 2553.98]  a ton of from us.
[2554.08 --> 2554.52]  Like we,
[2554.62 --> 2555.48]  we got an opportunity
[2555.48 --> 2556.66]  to see one of those
[2556.66 --> 2557.70]  big video walls
[2557.70 --> 2559.34]  like they famously used
[2559.34 --> 2560.10]  on The Mandalorian
[2560.10 --> 2561.02]  for virtual production
[2561.02 --> 2561.56]  season one
[2561.56 --> 2563.54]  and I was like,
[2563.62 --> 2563.94]  okay,
[2564.72 --> 2565.58]  can we game on it?
[2565.64 --> 2565.82]  You know,
[2565.86 --> 2566.22]  like I'm,
[2566.28 --> 2566.62]  like I'm,
[2566.62 --> 2567.88]  I'm looking for an angle
[2567.88 --> 2568.32]  that's,
[2568.32 --> 2568.76]  yeah,
[2568.90 --> 2569.82]  where I can tie it
[2569.82 --> 2570.58]  into our audience
[2570.58 --> 2571.94]  which is really technophiles,
[2572.08 --> 2572.40]  gamers.
[2573.78 --> 2574.58]  We have a,
[2574.62 --> 2575.58]  we have a lot of folks
[2575.58 --> 2576.86]  that are really into
[2576.86 --> 2577.94]  the enterprise side
[2577.94 --> 2578.82]  of IT as well
[2578.82 --> 2580.18]  but at the end of the day
[2580.18 --> 2581.94]  all those things tie back
[2581.94 --> 2583.88]  into the IT side
[2583.88 --> 2584.82]  of gaming,
[2584.92 --> 2585.94]  the IT side
[2585.94 --> 2586.54]  of,
[2586.88 --> 2588.10]  of sort of,
[2588.14 --> 2588.28]  you know,
[2588.28 --> 2589.12]  corporate infrastructure.
[2589.28 --> 2590.16]  It's IT
[2590.16 --> 2592.28]  rather than consumer electronics
[2592.28 --> 2594.26]  and the distinction
[2594.26 --> 2594.84]  between them
[2594.84 --> 2595.68]  always felt kind of
[2595.68 --> 2596.66]  arbitrary to me
[2596.66 --> 2597.74]  because my interest
[2597.74 --> 2598.48]  has always been
[2598.48 --> 2599.20]  in both of them.
[2599.40 --> 2600.04]  So I thought
[2600.04 --> 2601.30]  until I went to CES
[2601.30 --> 2601.88]  and I realized
[2601.88 --> 2602.64]  I actually didn't care
[2602.64 --> 2603.40]  about most of it
[2603.40 --> 2604.54]  and I mostly cared
[2604.54 --> 2605.50]  about the IT stuff.
[2605.82 --> 2605.98]  Like,
[2606.08 --> 2606.24]  oh,
[2606.32 --> 2606.50]  okay,
[2606.64 --> 2606.82]  yeah,
[2606.92 --> 2607.68]  I guess that makes sense.
[2607.90 --> 2608.62]  Over time,
[2608.72 --> 2610.04]  I've grown more interested
[2610.04 --> 2610.34]  in it
[2610.34 --> 2611.40]  but you got to understand
[2611.40 --> 2612.00]  when I attended
[2612.00 --> 2612.76]  my first CES
[2612.76 --> 2613.92]  I didn't even own a TV.
[2615.44 --> 2615.96]  Why would I?
[2616.00 --> 2617.12]  I have a perfectly good monitor
[2617.12 --> 2617.72]  right here.
[2617.98 --> 2618.52]  I didn't either.
[2618.70 --> 2619.08]  Exactly.
[2619.42 --> 2619.70]  So,
[2621.04 --> 2621.64]  it's just a,
[2621.64 --> 2622.48]  it's just a funny thing
[2622.48 --> 2623.10]  where the overlap
[2623.10 --> 2623.78]  is not as big
[2623.78 --> 2624.42]  as you might think.
[2624.76 --> 2626.12]  I completely agree with that.
[2626.24 --> 2626.40]  I,
[2626.56 --> 2627.58]  I will say though
[2627.58 --> 2628.74]  there's a corridor video
[2628.74 --> 2630.04]  I'm trying to find it right now
[2630.04 --> 2630.56]  but they,
[2631.08 --> 2632.16]  they do this like,
[2633.06 --> 2633.26]  they,
[2633.32 --> 2634.16]  they like resurrect
[2634.16 --> 2635.24]  I think Dan is gonna
[2635.24 --> 2636.56]  be able to call it out actually.
[2636.70 --> 2636.82]  Huh?
[2637.14 --> 2637.58]  Yeah.
[2638.08 --> 2640.02]  A green screen style technology
[2640.02 --> 2640.58]  that they did
[2640.58 --> 2641.80]  with these weird bulbs.
[2642.76 --> 2643.08]  Oh,
[2643.20 --> 2643.60]  God,
[2643.72 --> 2643.92]  yeah,
[2643.96 --> 2644.80]  that was amazing.
[2644.84 --> 2646.36]  That was really interesting.
[2646.50 --> 2646.92]  The last,
[2646.92 --> 2647.90]  I was talking about Mary Poppins?
[2648.04 --> 2648.20]  Yeah,
[2648.28 --> 2649.24]  the last Disney technology
[2649.24 --> 2650.44]  with the sodium lamps,
[2650.52 --> 2650.60]  right?
[2650.64 --> 2650.78]  Yeah.
[2650.90 --> 2651.48]  Sodium lamps.
[2651.48 --> 2651.78]  Oh,
[2651.82 --> 2653.40]  that was such a cool video.
[2653.64 --> 2654.62]  Wicked cool
[2654.62 --> 2655.42]  even if you're not
[2655.42 --> 2656.06]  into camera stuff.
[2656.06 --> 2656.24]  Yep,
[2656.26 --> 2656.80]  very cool.
[2657.00 --> 2657.20]  Yeah.
[2658.26 --> 2658.70]  Um,
[2659.62 --> 2659.92]  yeah,
[2660.06 --> 2660.86]  so just want to
[2660.86 --> 2661.36]  shout that out
[2661.36 --> 2661.78]  because that was,
[2661.94 --> 2662.48]  that was sick.
[2662.68 --> 2662.84]  More?
[2663.68 --> 2663.94]  Yeah.
[2664.86 --> 2665.18]  Uh,
[2665.24 --> 2665.54]  Linus,
[2665.56 --> 2665.98]  what are your thoughts
[2665.98 --> 2667.04]  on the Intel factory
[2667.04 --> 2668.30]  coming to Ohio?
[2668.54 --> 2669.48]  Your videos inspired me
[2669.48 --> 2669.90]  to pursue.
[2669.90 --> 2670.12]  Ohio?
[2670.46 --> 2670.96]  Ohio?
[2671.68 --> 2672.46]  Why would,
[2672.70 --> 2673.38]  isn't that the one
[2673.38 --> 2674.02]  that everybody wants
[2674.02 --> 2674.46]  to leave?
[2674.46 --> 2675.54]  I am young gentleman
[2675.54 --> 2679.04]  saying young gentleman meme.
[2679.04 --> 2681.32]  Oh no.
[2681.62 --> 2682.06]  Skibbity.
[2684.50 --> 2685.02]  Bonkers.
[2686.02 --> 2686.42]  Uh,
[2686.42 --> 2686.72]  your,
[2686.82 --> 2687.98]  your videos inspired me
[2687.98 --> 2688.74]  to pursue a career
[2688.74 --> 2690.00]  in electrical engineering.
[2690.18 --> 2690.70]  Hey,
[2690.76 --> 2692.14]  that is super cool.
[2692.14 --> 2693.00]  I am,
[2693.10 --> 2695.90]  I am extremely excited
[2695.90 --> 2696.86]  to see semiconductor
[2696.86 --> 2698.56]  manufacturing moving,
[2698.56 --> 2699.68]  um,
[2699.86 --> 2700.62]  on continent.
[2700.62 --> 2702.44]  I think that we are
[2702.44 --> 2703.60]  headed into a period
[2703.60 --> 2704.78]  of unprecedented
[2704.78 --> 2706.70]  global conflict.
[2706.94 --> 2708.24]  Maybe not unprecedented,
[2708.52 --> 2709.60]  but certainly unprecedented
[2709.60 --> 2711.04]  in my young lifetime.
[2711.22 --> 2711.62]  Um,
[2711.62 --> 2713.04]  and,
[2713.04 --> 2715.10]  or how would I say this?
[2715.14 --> 2715.72]  Not a conflict.
[2715.80 --> 2716.14]  I'll say uncertainty.
[2716.86 --> 2718.36]  We are headed into a period
[2718.36 --> 2718.92]  of uncertainty
[2718.92 --> 2719.92]  that I have never seen
[2719.92 --> 2720.88]  before in my lifetime.
[2720.88 --> 2722.40]  That is my revised statement.
[2722.52 --> 2723.68]  That one I will stand behind.
[2724.48 --> 2725.04]  And,
[2725.16 --> 2726.24]  seeing us
[2726.24 --> 2727.24]  building up
[2727.24 --> 2728.08]  infrastructure
[2728.08 --> 2729.62]  to continue
[2729.62 --> 2730.20]  to maintain
[2730.20 --> 2731.36]  our digital independence
[2731.36 --> 2732.12]  in the event
[2732.12 --> 2733.62]  that things hit the fan,
[2733.78 --> 2734.48]  uh,
[2734.52 --> 2735.22]  is pretty,
[2736.34 --> 2737.68]  seems pretty important
[2737.68 --> 2738.40]  to me.
[2738.54 --> 2739.08]  And,
[2739.26 --> 2740.48]  it's because Canada
[2740.48 --> 2741.70]  has no money,
[2742.04 --> 2742.66]  um,
[2742.84 --> 2743.20]  or,
[2743.94 --> 2744.28]  really,
[2744.44 --> 2745.92]  much strategic value
[2745.92 --> 2746.88]  for the most part.
[2747.36 --> 2747.38]  Um,
[2747.38 --> 2748.56]  everything's declining here.
[2748.56 --> 2748.92]  Yeah,
[2749.00 --> 2749.30]  it's,
[2749.40 --> 2749.52]  well,
[2749.56 --> 2750.10]  our population
[2750.10 --> 2750.86]  keeps going up,
[2750.92 --> 2751.22]  but we don't,
[2751.34 --> 2751.40]  like,
[2751.84 --> 2752.50]  build more houses
[2752.50 --> 2753.34]  to put anybody in.
[2753.44 --> 2753.58]  So,
[2753.74 --> 2754.02]  you know,
[2754.02 --> 2755.88]  that seems stupid to me.
[2756.04 --> 2756.20]  Yeah.
[2756.42 --> 2756.78]  Anyway,
[2756.94 --> 2758.04]  the point is that
[2758.04 --> 2758.62]  it's good to see
[2758.62 --> 2759.78]  our neighbors to the south
[2759.78 --> 2760.88]  and their,
[2760.88 --> 2762.66]  and their corporate partners,
[2762.92 --> 2763.40]  you know,
[2763.44 --> 2763.72]  whatever,
[2763.84 --> 2764.72]  however that relationship
[2764.72 --> 2765.44]  is complicated,
[2765.64 --> 2765.84]  works.
[2765.92 --> 2766.86]  If you did want to
[2766.86 --> 2768.18]  have a hat as a country,
[2768.18 --> 2768.68]  you might be able
[2768.68 --> 2769.50]  to buy us soon.
[2769.92 --> 2770.98]  If things keep going
[2770.98 --> 2771.44]  the way we are.
[2771.46 --> 2771.70]  I mean,
[2771.74 --> 2772.00]  at this,
[2772.06 --> 2772.52]  at this rate,
[2772.60 --> 2773.72]  Nvidia could buy us.
[2773.88 --> 2774.40]  Never mind.
[2774.70 --> 2774.80]  Yeah.
[2774.80 --> 2774.82]  Yeah,
[2774.82 --> 2775.04]  anyway.
[2775.16 --> 2775.44]  True.
[2775.44 --> 2775.88]  Um,
[2776.28 --> 2776.92]  I don't think the,
[2777.00 --> 2778.14]  I don't think the United States
[2778.14 --> 2778.74]  has any money,
[2778.88 --> 2779.82]  but Nvidia does.
[2780.64 --> 2781.68]  They have the ability
[2781.68 --> 2782.58]  to have more debt.
[2783.40 --> 2783.84]  Yeah.
[2784.16 --> 2784.60]  Anywho,
[2784.74 --> 2785.30]  um,
[2786.22 --> 2787.38]  it's a good thing.
[2787.52 --> 2788.84]  I'm happy to see it.
[2791.38 --> 2793.22]  Saving up for a backpack,
[2793.36 --> 2795.04]  a $10 gift card at a time.
[2795.26 --> 2796.56]  Why are graphic cards so big,
[2796.64 --> 2799.48]  but you can buy loose CPUs?
[2799.58 --> 2800.80]  No build your own graphics card?
[2800.80 --> 2801.42]  Fun fact,
[2801.54 --> 2803.20]  that used to be more of a thing.
[2803.32 --> 2804.78]  I don't know that I ever saw
[2804.78 --> 2806.74]  a socketed GPU,
[2807.06 --> 2808.28]  but you could definitely
[2808.28 --> 2808.82]  buy,
[2808.92 --> 2809.28]  uh,
[2809.28 --> 2810.16]  graphics cards
[2810.16 --> 2812.72]  that had sockets for memory.
[2812.88 --> 2814.98]  So you could actually configure them
[2814.98 --> 2815.96]  with the amount of,
[2815.96 --> 2816.30]  uh,
[2816.30 --> 2818.16]  video memory that you wanted them to have,
[2818.20 --> 2819.40]  depending on your application.
[2819.62 --> 2821.52]  The challenge is that
[2821.52 --> 2823.32]  the same integration
[2823.32 --> 2824.80]  that we're seeing take place,
[2824.80 --> 2825.64]  um,
[2825.74 --> 2826.48]  on mobile,
[2826.76 --> 2827.22]  uh,
[2827.22 --> 2830.28]  right now with CPUs slash SOCs,
[2830.28 --> 2831.80]  where we're seeing the RAM
[2831.80 --> 2834.58]  either soldered onto the main board
[2834.58 --> 2836.84]  or even on package,
[2836.96 --> 2838.96]  like right next to the CPU die.
[2839.38 --> 2839.84]  Um,
[2839.96 --> 2842.66]  that same trend took place on GPUs
[2842.66 --> 2843.82]  way,
[2844.08 --> 2845.34]  way longer ago
[2845.34 --> 2847.32]  because they are so hungry
[2847.32 --> 2848.40]  for memory bandwidth
[2848.40 --> 2849.88]  that getting those traces
[2849.88 --> 2851.04]  as close as possible
[2851.04 --> 2852.74]  and getting those cards
[2852.74 --> 2854.28]  as integrated as possible
[2854.28 --> 2856.14]  was more performance critical
[2856.14 --> 2858.34]  than it was on CPUs,
[2858.34 --> 2858.82]  or at least
[2858.82 --> 2860.28]  it was much faster
[2860.28 --> 2863.06]  that the performance advantage
[2863.06 --> 2863.92]  outweighed
[2863.92 --> 2865.58]  the modularity advantage
[2865.58 --> 2866.42]  from a,
[2866.52 --> 2867.22]  from a cost
[2867.22 --> 2869.30]  and consumer preference standpoint.
[2869.80 --> 2870.40]  So,
[2870.40 --> 2872.28]  graphics cards are big
[2872.28 --> 2874.18]  because their orientation
[2874.18 --> 2876.50]  makes them extremely difficult
[2876.50 --> 2878.20]  to efficiently cool
[2878.20 --> 2879.26]  and stay quiet.
[2879.50 --> 2879.82]  Like,
[2879.88 --> 2881.02]  if you put a tower cooler
[2881.02 --> 2881.64]  on a GPU,
[2881.64 --> 2882.44]  it doesn't need to be
[2882.44 --> 2883.50]  nearly as big
[2883.50 --> 2884.44]  as,
[2884.56 --> 2885.08]  as,
[2885.16 --> 2885.86]  as these like
[2885.86 --> 2887.20]  sideways monstrosities
[2887.20 --> 2888.42]  because they're so limited
[2888.42 --> 2890.06]  by the skinny fans
[2890.06 --> 2890.78]  and,
[2890.88 --> 2891.32]  um,
[2891.60 --> 2892.14]  and the,
[2892.30 --> 2892.76]  and the,
[2892.84 --> 2893.76]  the way that the air
[2893.76 --> 2895.68]  has to flow through them.
[2895.68 --> 2895.88]  It's,
[2895.88 --> 2896.08]  it's,
[2896.14 --> 2896.96]  it's a lot worse
[2896.96 --> 2898.20]  than just flowing straight through
[2898.20 --> 2899.96]  like something like a CPU tower heat sink.
[2899.96 --> 2900.48]  So,
[2900.52 --> 2902.10]  they're big for that reason.
[2902.10 --> 2903.66]  And then as for
[2903.66 --> 2905.46]  why you can't buy a loose GPU,
[2905.82 --> 2906.62]  it's because
[2906.62 --> 2909.12]  they're just so tightly integrated
[2909.12 --> 2910.12]  that there would be nothing
[2910.12 --> 2911.72]  you could do with a loose GPU.
[2911.96 --> 2913.30]  There are exceptions to that.
[2913.38 --> 2914.84]  I believe there have been some,
[2914.84 --> 2915.26]  uh,
[2915.26 --> 2916.04]  some tech shops
[2916.04 --> 2916.84]  slash YouTubers
[2916.84 --> 2918.56]  slash both
[2918.56 --> 2920.20]  that have actually performed
[2920.20 --> 2921.62]  some pretty wild upgrades.
[2921.72 --> 2923.40]  I thought I saw someone put a 4090
[2923.40 --> 2923.96]  on a 3090
[2924.56 --> 2926.24]  or 3090 Ti PCB.
[2926.56 --> 2927.66]  Don't quote me on that,
[2927.72 --> 2929.34]  but there have definitely been cases
[2929.34 --> 2931.64]  where socket compatible chips
[2931.64 --> 2933.22]  have been desoldered
[2933.22 --> 2934.24]  and then re-soldered
[2934.24 --> 2935.38]  onto other PCBs,
[2935.42 --> 2938.96]  but that is extremely uncommon.
[2941.22 --> 2941.92]  Your video,
[2941.98 --> 2942.74]  you did a video on this.
[2942.84 --> 2942.98]  Uh,
[2943.14 --> 2943.70]  no.
[2943.98 --> 2944.12]  No,
[2944.16 --> 2946.42]  that was repairing a MacBook
[2946.42 --> 2947.82]  and also it didn't work.
[2947.88 --> 2948.10]  It died.
[2951.56 --> 2953.56]  It wasn't putting on a different one.
[2953.62 --> 2954.94]  I guess we never explained
[2954.94 --> 2955.94]  merch messages
[2955.94 --> 2956.74]  and also
[2956.74 --> 2958.98]  I have never
[2958.98 --> 2959.98]  launched
[2959.98 --> 2961.00]  a crazy
[2961.00 --> 2962.64]  surprise deal
[2962.64 --> 2963.12]  yet.
[2963.58 --> 2963.88]  So,
[2964.08 --> 2964.68]  why don't we explain
[2964.68 --> 2965.76]  how merch messages work?
[2965.84 --> 2966.64]  You're probably seeing
[2966.64 --> 2968.18]  people's messages down here.
[2968.56 --> 2969.56]  Dan is replying
[2969.56 --> 2970.34]  to some of your messages.
[2970.56 --> 2971.64]  We just responded
[2971.64 --> 2973.04]  to a few of them ourselves.
[2973.28 --> 2973.64]  Let's see,
[2973.68 --> 2974.38]  our fingers on fire.
[2974.44 --> 2975.10]  I don't see any smoke,
[2975.20 --> 2975.58]  so that's good.
[2976.00 --> 2976.18]  Uh,
[2976.18 --> 2976.80]  we just responded
[2976.80 --> 2977.64]  to a few of them ourselves.
[2977.78 --> 2978.24]  All you gotta do
[2978.24 --> 2979.58]  is go to lttstore.com
[2979.58 --> 2980.24]  where we are currently
[2980.24 --> 2980.88]  celebrating
[2980.88 --> 2982.32]  Lime Day
[2982.32 --> 2983.64]  with some pretty
[2983.64 --> 2985.06]  wild deals.
[2985.24 --> 2985.78]  Here's a little
[2985.78 --> 2986.92]  summary for y'all
[2986.92 --> 2987.66]  who are just tuning
[2987.66 --> 2988.30]  into the show
[2988.30 --> 2988.98]  right now.
[2989.28 --> 2990.20]  It's Lime Day,
[2990.28 --> 2990.52]  baby!
[2990.70 --> 2991.84]  Free shipping on orders
[2991.84 --> 2992.46]  over $100.
[2992.84 --> 2993.00]  Also,
[2993.06 --> 2993.96]  we got a ton
[2993.96 --> 2994.70]  of deals!
[2995.90 --> 2996.64]  And all you gotta do
[2996.64 --> 2997.58]  is go to your cart.
[2997.72 --> 2998.08]  There's gonna be
[2998.08 --> 2998.66]  a little box
[2998.66 --> 2999.60]  whenever we're live
[2999.60 --> 3000.40]  and you can type
[3000.40 --> 3001.00]  a merch message
[3001.00 --> 3001.58]  and it'll go to
[3001.58 --> 3002.38]  producer Dan
[3002.38 --> 3003.32]  who will reply to it,
[3003.42 --> 3004.16]  forward it to someone
[3004.16 --> 3004.92]  who can take care
[3004.92 --> 3005.52]  of your message
[3005.52 --> 3007.46]  or send it to me
[3007.46 --> 3008.26]  and Luke
[3008.26 --> 3009.16]  as a curated
[3009.16 --> 3009.80]  merch message
[3009.80 --> 3010.86]  for us to respond to.
[3010.96 --> 3011.36]  So we just did
[3011.36 --> 3011.92]  a few of those
[3011.92 --> 3012.92]  and I'm gonna give
[3012.92 --> 3013.58]  you an A.
[3014.70 --> 3015.18]  Rude.
[3015.48 --> 3016.18]  And I'm gonna give
[3016.18 --> 3017.00]  you an incentive
[3017.00 --> 3020.86]  to try it out.
[3021.18 --> 3021.78]  I don't know.
[3022.36 --> 3023.02]  Tell you what.
[3023.46 --> 3023.82]  Luke?
[3025.32 --> 3025.76]  Four.
[3026.24 --> 3026.58]  Oh.
[3027.14 --> 3027.50]  Alright,
[3027.56 --> 3028.44]  he's way ahead of me.
[3029.98 --> 3030.84]  I just guessed.
[3031.44 --> 3031.70]  Okay.
[3032.24 --> 3033.16]  We don't have
[3033.16 --> 3034.08]  a lot of these
[3034.08 --> 3035.26]  and I suspect
[3035.26 --> 3035.82]  they're gonna go
[3035.82 --> 3036.68]  pretty fast
[3036.68 --> 3037.90]  which is
[3037.90 --> 3039.20]  gonna be a theme
[3039.20 --> 3040.54]  for these surprise
[3040.54 --> 3041.72]  lightning deals.
[3041.72 --> 3042.26]  Let's call them
[3042.26 --> 3043.18]  lightning deals.
[3045.32 --> 3045.76]  Oh.
[3045.94 --> 3046.68]  We found some
[3046.68 --> 3047.84]  Swacket V2s.
[3048.34 --> 3048.82]  I don't know
[3048.82 --> 3049.48]  what kind of
[3049.48 --> 3051.24]  sizing mix we have
[3051.24 --> 3052.56]  or anything like that
[3052.56 --> 3052.98]  in here.
[3053.62 --> 3054.76]  Can I check?
[3054.82 --> 3055.46]  Can I check our stock?
[3055.56 --> 3055.70]  Oh,
[3055.86 --> 3057.18]  we do have a little bit
[3057.18 --> 3058.14]  of everything.
[3059.64 --> 3060.36]  The one that you are...
[3060.36 --> 3061.30]  Not a lot of some of those.
[3061.42 --> 3061.66]  Yeah,
[3061.74 --> 3062.94]  not a lot of some of them.
[3064.34 --> 3065.86]  And we are putting up
[3065.86 --> 3066.90]  the very last
[3066.90 --> 3068.50]  of the Swacket V2s
[3068.50 --> 3070.76]  for 50% off.
[3071.62 --> 3073.62]  So that's gonna be...
[3073.62 --> 3074.64]  What does that work out to?
[3074.74 --> 3076.32]  Good gravy.
[3076.52 --> 3077.36]  This is an interesting question.
[3077.46 --> 3078.24]  Do you know this, Linus?
[3078.36 --> 3078.98]  If...
[3078.98 --> 3079.70]  The question was
[3079.70 --> 3080.62]  from Lumet Man.
[3080.76 --> 3081.08]  He said,
[3081.16 --> 3081.98]  if he releases
[3081.98 --> 3082.64]  multiple deals
[3082.64 --> 3083.08]  throughout the show
[3083.08 --> 3083.78]  and I want to lock in
[3083.78 --> 3084.40]  each one of them,
[3084.46 --> 3085.46]  will multiple individual
[3085.46 --> 3086.36]  orders be combined
[3086.36 --> 3087.02]  for shipping?
[3087.14 --> 3087.96]  Do we do combined shipping?
[3087.96 --> 3090.10]  I think that if the order
[3090.10 --> 3093.00]  is in North America,
[3093.00 --> 3093.88]  we can.
[3094.60 --> 3098.36]  And that's our less loss.
[3100.12 --> 3101.80]  And if they are outside of there
[3101.80 --> 3103.10]  because of like shipping manifests
[3103.10 --> 3104.68]  and stuff and import and stuff,
[3104.72 --> 3105.42]  we can't.
[3105.94 --> 3107.60]  But as long as you add
[3107.60 --> 3108.48]  a couple of other things
[3108.48 --> 3109.16]  to your cart,
[3109.78 --> 3111.02]  then you...
[3111.02 --> 3111.26]  Well,
[3111.32 --> 3112.20]  if you get over $100,
[3112.62 --> 3113.46]  then you get free shipping
[3113.46 --> 3114.30]  on the entire order anyway.
[3114.30 --> 3115.26]  Oh, they're saying
[3115.26 --> 3117.62]  they want to catch your deals
[3117.62 --> 3118.28]  as you're saying them
[3118.28 --> 3118.90]  throughout the show.
[3119.02 --> 3119.66]  So they want to do
[3119.66 --> 3121.24]  like a bunch of orders.
[3121.44 --> 3121.68]  Yeah.
[3121.76 --> 3122.44]  Yeah, you're going to need
[3122.44 --> 3123.50]  to place orders.
[3123.86 --> 3124.04]  Yeah.
[3124.38 --> 3125.82]  Yeah, I'm not...
[3125.82 --> 3126.40]  It is what it is.
[3126.42 --> 3127.64]  You can't buy every deal.
[3127.74 --> 3128.72]  That's not a...
[3128.72 --> 3130.34]  I'm not even going to facilitate that.
[3130.38 --> 3130.64]  You know what?
[3130.66 --> 3130.86]  No.
[3131.06 --> 3131.66]  No, I'm not.
[3131.72 --> 3132.16]  No, I'm not.
[3132.16 --> 3132.50]  I'm not.
[3132.50 --> 3133.94]  I'm not facilitating that.
[3134.28 --> 3135.60]  No, no, no, no.
[3135.64 --> 3135.90]  Anyway.
[3136.04 --> 3136.52]  Yeah, you have to buy
[3136.52 --> 3137.40]  every deal twice.
[3137.56 --> 3138.50]  Anyway, the Swack It deal
[3138.50 --> 3139.08]  is up.
[3139.08 --> 3140.16]  80-something percent of gamers
[3140.16 --> 3141.40]  do microtransactions, dude.
[3141.62 --> 3142.68]  There it is, baby.
[3142.68 --> 3143.96]  $49.99.
[3145.42 --> 3146.48]  Can I pay $5 more
[3146.48 --> 3147.16]  to get it in blue?
[3147.76 --> 3148.14]  No.
[3148.36 --> 3148.90]  In blue?
[3149.16 --> 3151.00]  Yeah, I want a different skin.
[3151.74 --> 3152.66]  Oh, my God.
[3153.78 --> 3154.72]  Thank you for that, Dan.
[3155.38 --> 3156.06]  What do you want
[3156.06 --> 3157.06]  our next topic to be, Luke?
[3157.26 --> 3158.46]  Oh, sorry.
[3158.52 --> 3159.58]  I was stunned by Dan.
[3160.52 --> 3160.94]  Sorry.
[3161.22 --> 3161.74]  I'm sorry.
[3162.46 --> 3163.54]  Let me find one.
[3164.28 --> 3165.70]  STI screening app
[3165.70 --> 3168.34]  for pics of your dong
[3168.34 --> 3171.12]  is shut down by the FTC.
[3171.12 --> 3173.18]  A company called
[3173.18 --> 3173.82]  He Health
[3173.82 --> 3174.84]  has shut down
[3174.84 --> 3175.78]  its app called
[3175.78 --> 3176.46]  Calmara
[3176.46 --> 3178.08]  following investigation
[3178.08 --> 3178.94]  by the FTC.
[3179.44 --> 3180.68]  Calmara purported
[3180.68 --> 3181.96]  to be able
[3181.96 --> 3182.72]  to use
[3182.72 --> 3183.62]  AI
[3183.62 --> 3185.00]  to screen
[3185.00 --> 3185.64]  your dong
[3185.64 --> 3186.02]  pics
[3186.02 --> 3186.64]  for signs
[3186.64 --> 3187.60]  of 10 sexually
[3187.60 --> 3188.14]  transmitted
[3188.14 --> 3189.20]  really?
[3190.14 --> 3191.02]  10 sexually
[3191.02 --> 3191.66]  transmitted
[3191.66 --> 3192.42]  infections
[3192.42 --> 3193.50]  with up to
[3193.50 --> 3194.44]  94%
[3194.44 --> 3194.94]  accuracy.
[3195.16 --> 3196.36]  This happened?
[3196.90 --> 3198.32]  Are you kidding me?
[3198.32 --> 3199.56]  Notably...
[3199.56 --> 3200.88]  I can't believe you missed this.
[3201.08 --> 3202.22]  No, I had no idea.
[3202.30 --> 3203.10]  This was like...
[3203.10 --> 3205.58]  Dude, everyone was talking about this
[3205.58 --> 3206.54]  in the office this week.
[3206.60 --> 3208.28]  This was like the big tech news.
[3209.66 --> 3211.84]  Like, forget about CrowdStrike.
[3212.02 --> 3212.66]  This was...
[3212.66 --> 3214.62]  This was the biggest tech news
[3214.62 --> 3215.38]  for us this week.
[3215.38 --> 3216.58]  At least all these lonely dudes
[3216.58 --> 3218.58]  aren't gonna harass women anymore.
[3218.66 --> 3219.66]  They're gonna send it to this company,
[3219.76 --> 3219.94]  I guess.
[3219.94 --> 3220.18]  Yeah.
[3220.18 --> 3222.24]  Notably, many STIs
[3222.24 --> 3223.56]  lack any visible
[3223.56 --> 3225.30]  external symptoms.
[3225.56 --> 3225.96]  Further,
[3226.24 --> 3226.84]  an investigation
[3226.84 --> 3228.08]  by the Los Angeles Times
[3228.08 --> 3229.06]  discovered that the app
[3229.06 --> 3230.00]  wasn't always great
[3230.00 --> 3230.72]  at distinguishing
[3230.72 --> 3231.98]  between penises
[3231.98 --> 3233.40]  and phallic-shaped
[3233.40 --> 3234.52]  inanimate objects
[3234.52 --> 3235.90]  issuing a clean bill
[3235.90 --> 3236.40]  of health
[3236.40 --> 3237.80]  to a novelty cake
[3237.80 --> 3238.84]  shaped like a dong.
[3242.34 --> 3243.40]  The FTC
[3243.40 --> 3244.82]  opened an investigation
[3244.82 --> 3245.86]  into He Health
[3245.86 --> 3248.10]  as making health-related claims
[3248.10 --> 3248.88]  without adequate
[3248.88 --> 3249.82]  scientific data
[3249.82 --> 3251.14]  is very illegal.
[3251.18 --> 3251.80]  Unless you're
[3251.80 --> 3253.08]  a supplement company.
[3253.70 --> 3253.90]  Yeah.
[3254.10 --> 3254.40]  True.
[3254.82 --> 3255.02]  Yeah.
[3255.66 --> 3256.56]  The FTC found
[3256.56 --> 3257.32]  that He Health
[3257.32 --> 3258.48]  had only tested
[3258.48 --> 3259.12]  their algorithm
[3259.12 --> 3260.52]  on a limited number
[3260.52 --> 3261.26]  of images.
[3262.72 --> 3263.48]  I mean...
[3263.48 --> 3264.94]  Good, I guess.
[3265.06 --> 3265.64]  There are a lot
[3265.64 --> 3266.20]  of those images
[3266.20 --> 3266.76]  on the internet.
[3266.90 --> 3267.48]  They probably could have
[3267.48 --> 3268.56]  used a bigger sample set.
[3269.12 --> 3269.40]  Likewise,
[3269.62 --> 3270.56]  a study associated
[3270.56 --> 3271.12]  with the app
[3271.12 --> 3271.74]  only...
[3271.74 --> 3275.24]  How did they test positives?
[3276.00 --> 3277.12]  Is like someone on stat...
[3277.12 --> 3277.30]  Oh.
[3278.34 --> 3278.82]  On stat.
[3278.88 --> 3279.32]  I get it.
[3279.54 --> 3280.06]  Yeah.
[3280.50 --> 3280.82]  Likewise,
[3281.00 --> 3281.80]  a study associated
[3281.80 --> 3282.36]  with the app
[3282.36 --> 3283.16]  only claimed
[3283.16 --> 3284.58]  it could identify
[3284.58 --> 3285.62]  four STIs,
[3285.72 --> 3286.28]  not ten.
[3286.70 --> 3287.24]  The FTC
[3287.24 --> 3288.36]  has thus ordered
[3288.36 --> 3289.50]  the app closed
[3289.50 --> 3290.58]  and all associated
[3290.58 --> 3292.12]  user data deleted.
[3292.32 --> 3292.78]  None of this
[3292.78 --> 3293.80]  is even the worst part.
[3294.42 --> 3294.72]  Do you know
[3294.72 --> 3296.10]  about the microtransactions
[3296.10 --> 3297.28]  within the app?
[3297.84 --> 3298.26]  No.
[3299.04 --> 3299.46]  That's right.
[3299.52 --> 3300.16]  People could buy
[3300.16 --> 3300.88]  four skins.
[3300.88 --> 3310.04]  ten out of ten.
[3310.04 --> 3310.10]  Ten out of ten.
[3311.96 --> 3313.04]  I want mine to be
[3313.04 --> 3313.64]  a different color.
[3313.92 --> 3314.24]  Anyway,
[3314.74 --> 3318.04]  our discussion questions...
[3318.62 --> 3320.52]  It depends on the STI.
[3320.52 --> 3324.86]  Our discussion questions
[3324.86 --> 3325.78]  are many here.
[3326.06 --> 3326.98]  Do we really need
[3326.98 --> 3327.66]  what is essentially
[3327.66 --> 3329.28]  a giant dick pic repository?
[3329.78 --> 3330.08]  Apparently.
[3330.24 --> 3331.58]  Do we not already have that?
[3331.58 --> 3332.30]  A bigger one, actually.
[3332.40 --> 3332.80]  They didn't have
[3332.80 --> 3333.62]  a big enough sample set.
[3333.62 --> 3334.56]  Is chat roulette
[3334.56 --> 3335.22]  not enough?
[3335.22 --> 3338.82]  Sorry, that's a dated reference.
[3338.96 --> 3339.22]  I don't know
[3339.22 --> 3340.22]  whatever the current
[3340.22 --> 3341.62]  random chat
[3341.62 --> 3342.52]  with strangers app
[3342.52 --> 3343.72]  that I'm sure
[3343.72 --> 3344.86]  is full of penises.
[3345.30 --> 3345.56]  Yeah.
[3346.08 --> 3347.04]  As is tradition.
[3347.30 --> 3348.16]  Privacy-wise,
[3348.38 --> 3349.18]  what if someone
[3349.18 --> 3349.96]  submits a picture
[3349.96 --> 3350.94]  of someone else's penis?
[3351.08 --> 3351.58]  I mean, yeah,
[3351.74 --> 3352.70]  that would be...
[3352.70 --> 3353.40]  I thought that was
[3353.40 --> 3354.26]  part of their pitch
[3354.26 --> 3354.86]  for this thing
[3354.86 --> 3355.62]  was that you could
[3355.62 --> 3356.42]  submit one
[3356.42 --> 3357.66]  that someone sent to you
[3357.66 --> 3359.10]  and be like,
[3359.18 --> 3360.14]  is it safe to have
[3360.14 --> 3361.16]  unprotected sex
[3361.16 --> 3361.88]  with this person?
[3362.10 --> 3363.34]  It can...
[3363.34 --> 3364.00]  Oh, man.
[3364.12 --> 3364.40]  I mean,
[3364.50 --> 3365.20]  they are...
[3365.22 --> 3366.76]  They are lucky
[3366.76 --> 3368.18]  they got shut down
[3368.18 --> 3369.62]  because if they had
[3369.62 --> 3371.22]  gone down by lawsuit...
[3371.90 --> 3372.18]  Yeah.
[3372.48 --> 3373.36]  ...from people that...
[3373.36 --> 3374.08]  Longer period of time.
[3374.16 --> 3375.36]  ...they got a sexually
[3375.36 --> 3376.22]  transmitted infection...
[3376.76 --> 3377.04]  Oh!
[3380.86 --> 3382.10]  This doesn't necessarily
[3382.10 --> 3382.98]  mean that they won't.
[3384.66 --> 3385.92]  That could still happen.
[3386.54 --> 3387.12]  Still time.
[3387.74 --> 3387.96]  Yeah.
[3388.20 --> 3389.60]  Dude, my mind is...
[3389.60 --> 3390.64]  My mind is...
[3390.64 --> 3391.88]  My mind is blown.
[3391.88 --> 3395.34]  Can I make a segue
[3395.34 --> 3396.16]  off that somehow?
[3396.54 --> 3396.98]  Yeah.
[3397.20 --> 3397.48]  Oh.
[3397.86 --> 3398.24]  Well,
[3398.38 --> 3399.22]  we would have been able
[3399.22 --> 3400.66]  to segue to this topic.
[3400.82 --> 3401.34]  From it,
[3401.56 --> 3403.20]  a little bit more challenging.
[3404.82 --> 3406.84]  What are we supposed
[3406.84 --> 3407.74]  to be doing, Dan?
[3407.80 --> 3408.88]  What even is this show?
[3408.88 --> 3409.34]  Topics?
[3409.34 --> 3410.72]  The company apologizes
[3410.72 --> 3412.18]  for threatening reviewer.
[3412.78 --> 3413.48]  David Stephen,
[3413.68 --> 3414.62]  the managing director
[3414.62 --> 3416.52]  of audio brand DCS,
[3416.60 --> 3417.80]  has apologized to YouTuber
[3417.80 --> 3419.68]  and reviewer Cameron Oatley,
[3419.90 --> 3421.00]  also known as Golden Sound,
[3421.28 --> 3422.08]  following allegations
[3422.08 --> 3422.80]  that a representative
[3422.80 --> 3423.52]  from the company
[3423.52 --> 3424.66]  threatened to sue him
[3424.66 --> 3425.54]  over a review
[3425.54 --> 3426.86]  from three years ago.
[3427.72 --> 3428.78]  According to Golden Sound,
[3428.94 --> 3429.90]  he was contacted
[3429.90 --> 3431.18]  by a company representative
[3431.18 --> 3433.08]  in October of last year,
[3433.40 --> 3434.34]  alleging inaccuracies
[3434.34 --> 3435.96]  in his 2021 review
[3435.96 --> 3437.48]  of a DCS product.
[3438.10 --> 3438.90]  Oatley asked
[3438.90 --> 3439.78]  for further details
[3439.78 --> 3441.10]  so he could correct
[3441.10 --> 3442.38]  any factual inaccuracies,
[3442.70 --> 3443.54]  but didn't hear back
[3443.54 --> 3444.16]  from DCS
[3444.16 --> 3446.12]  until May of 2024
[3446.12 --> 3447.32]  when he received
[3447.32 --> 3448.44]  a list of errors
[3448.44 --> 3449.52]  alongside the threat
[3449.52 --> 3450.78]  of potential legal action
[3450.78 --> 3451.90]  if they were not fixed
[3451.90 --> 3452.96]  within 10 days
[3452.96 --> 3453.74]  after that delay.
[3454.00 --> 3454.20]  Yeah, sure.
[3454.70 --> 3456.00]  Oatley claims, however,
[3456.18 --> 3457.66]  that none of the listed complaints
[3457.66 --> 3459.18]  were true factual errors.
[3459.62 --> 3460.30]  Managing director
[3460.30 --> 3461.24]  David Stevens
[3461.24 --> 3462.10]  originally refuted
[3462.10 --> 3462.76]  these allegations,
[3462.96 --> 3463.76]  claiming that the company
[3463.76 --> 3464.50]  had not provided
[3464.50 --> 3467.46]  a list of inaccuracies
[3467.46 --> 3468.46]  in 2022
[3468.46 --> 3470.04]  and Oatley failed
[3470.04 --> 3471.02]  to follow up on them
[3471.02 --> 3472.08]  and that there was
[3472.08 --> 3473.26]  no threat of litigation.
[3473.84 --> 3475.00]  Following further rebuttal
[3475.00 --> 3476.12]  from Oatley's employer,
[3476.46 --> 3477.30]  Headphones.com,
[3477.56 --> 3479.00]  and internal investigation
[3479.00 --> 3479.88]  at DCS,
[3480.24 --> 3481.20]  Steven now says
[3481.20 --> 3482.18]  that his initial statement,
[3482.40 --> 3484.28]  while issued in good faith,
[3484.52 --> 3486.10]  was based on faulty information
[3486.10 --> 3486.88]  given to him
[3486.88 --> 3487.80]  by someone who
[3487.80 --> 3489.82]  now no longer works
[3489.82 --> 3491.12]  for DCS.
[3491.62 --> 3493.40]  Stevens apologized to Oatley,
[3493.40 --> 3494.98]  stating that certain messages
[3494.98 --> 3495.58]  sent to him
[3495.58 --> 3497.16]  were totally unacceptable.
[3497.66 --> 3498.78]  DCS apparently plans
[3498.78 --> 3499.64]  to meet with Oatley
[3499.64 --> 3500.32]  in person
[3500.32 --> 3501.16]  and has sworn
[3501.16 --> 3502.30]  to repair their relationship.
[3503.18 --> 3503.68]  Good.
[3504.18 --> 3504.44]  Yeah.
[3505.08 --> 3505.48]  I mean,
[3505.50 --> 3506.86]  this is about as well
[3506.86 --> 3507.52]  as you can expect
[3507.52 --> 3508.56]  something like this to end.
[3508.76 --> 3511.54]  I saw this kerfuffle startup
[3511.54 --> 3512.98]  and I basically was like,
[3513.68 --> 3515.52]  just let us know
[3515.52 --> 3516.74]  what you need.
[3517.22 --> 3518.62]  The Headphones.com folks
[3518.62 --> 3519.98]  are super awesome.
[3519.98 --> 3520.70]  We've worked with them
[3520.70 --> 3521.34]  a number of times
[3521.34 --> 3521.96]  in the past.
[3523.12 --> 3525.70]  I think this is mutual,
[3526.00 --> 3527.82]  but we feel
[3527.82 --> 3529.00]  that our missions
[3529.00 --> 3530.90]  are pretty closely aligned
[3530.90 --> 3532.92]  to demystifying technology
[3532.92 --> 3533.50]  for people
[3533.50 --> 3535.50]  and seeing them bullied
[3535.50 --> 3536.10]  like this
[3536.10 --> 3538.20]  was absolutely unacceptable
[3538.20 --> 3540.66]  from our standpoint.
[3541.04 --> 3542.64]  So we're really glad
[3542.64 --> 3543.84]  to see that this was
[3543.84 --> 3546.38]  hopefully just a miscommunication.
[3546.90 --> 3548.12]  Oh, Golden Sound is here.
[3548.62 --> 3549.60]  Oh, sick.
[3549.66 --> 3550.34]  What's up, Golden Sound?
[3550.42 --> 3550.84]  That's cool.
[3550.94 --> 3551.54]  I didn't know that.
[3551.84 --> 3552.04]  What's up?
[3552.04 --> 3552.52]  Yeah, Golden Sound's
[3552.52 --> 3553.24]  in floatplane chat.
[3553.34 --> 3553.74]  Chat says,
[3553.82 --> 3554.64]  thanks for your support with this.
[3554.70 --> 3555.22]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3555.22 --> 3555.84]  I saw you do that.
[3555.90 --> 3556.28]  Reach out.
[3556.52 --> 3557.44]  Yeah, we got you.
[3557.52 --> 3558.48]  Don't even trip, dog.
[3558.66 --> 3559.86]  Highly respected the approach.
[3559.94 --> 3560.52]  I just want to say.
[3560.64 --> 3561.14]  Yeah, well,
[3561.22 --> 3562.18]  it's one of those things
[3562.18 --> 3564.04]  where there's another one
[3564.04 --> 3564.90]  behind the scenes
[3564.90 --> 3565.86]  where they're not ready
[3565.86 --> 3566.68]  to talk about it yet
[3566.68 --> 3567.66]  because there could be
[3567.66 --> 3569.66]  some pending stuff.
[3571.02 --> 3572.96]  But we've got there back too
[3572.96 --> 3574.66]  and if it comes down to it
[3574.66 --> 3576.18]  and if this goes public
[3576.18 --> 3577.84]  and turns into a big show,
[3578.38 --> 3580.76]  then we're in it to win it.
[3580.96 --> 3581.24]  We're ready.
[3581.52 --> 3581.68]  Yeah.
[3583.22 --> 3583.66]  Yeah.
[3584.88 --> 3586.52]  Yeah, so the discussion question is,
[3586.62 --> 3588.20]  is this a happy ending of a sort?
[3588.32 --> 3589.70]  I think so, to be honest.
[3589.92 --> 3590.46]  Yeah, I mean,
[3590.52 --> 3591.94]  the most that you can do
[3591.94 --> 3593.52]  when you do something wrong
[3593.52 --> 3595.42]  is apologize.
[3595.42 --> 3596.16]  Let's make it right.
[3596.32 --> 3598.52]  And make it right moving forward.
[3598.98 --> 3601.60]  I'm not going to ask DCS
[3601.60 --> 3602.98]  to just shut down.
[3603.12 --> 3603.28]  No.
[3603.28 --> 3604.80]  Like, that's not constructive.
[3605.24 --> 3605.36]  No.
[3605.38 --> 3607.58]  So as long as they're moving forward
[3607.58 --> 3608.16]  in good faith,
[3608.22 --> 3608.92]  then I think that's all
[3608.92 --> 3610.08]  that we can really ask for.
[3610.22 --> 3611.40]  And thank you very much
[3611.40 --> 3613.16]  for being mature enough
[3613.16 --> 3614.16]  to investigate,
[3614.52 --> 3615.56]  figure out what went wrong,
[3615.72 --> 3617.58]  and try to find a path forward.
[3618.38 --> 3619.50]  Yeah, Golden Sound in chat
[3619.50 --> 3619.92]  just said,
[3620.00 --> 3621.22]  here's hoping this sort of stuff
[3621.22 --> 3622.88]  is not something we see more of.
[3623.02 --> 3623.78]  I think we will.
[3624.02 --> 3624.84]  I think we will,
[3624.90 --> 3626.44]  but I also do agree as well.
[3626.62 --> 3627.58]  But as long as,
[3627.62 --> 3628.98]  I think as long as tech media
[3628.98 --> 3630.18]  has each other's backs
[3630.18 --> 3631.64]  and as long as we present
[3631.64 --> 3632.80]  a united front against
[3632.80 --> 3633.74]  this kind of behavior,
[3634.18 --> 3634.34]  you know,
[3634.34 --> 3635.30]  kind of like what happened
[3635.30 --> 3637.24]  with Hardware Unboxed
[3637.24 --> 3637.92]  back in the day,
[3638.38 --> 3639.38]  then I think it,
[3639.44 --> 3642.20]  I think it acts as a deterrent.
[3642.28 --> 3642.92]  It's almost like,
[3642.92 --> 3643.88]  it's almost like a,
[3643.88 --> 3645.44]  like a unionization of sorts.
[3645.44 --> 3646.12]  Like, obviously,
[3646.12 --> 3647.00]  we're all independent
[3647.00 --> 3647.96]  from each other.
[3648.04 --> 3649.02]  We don't, like,
[3649.46 --> 3650.00]  we're not,
[3650.24 --> 3650.52]  we don't,
[3650.52 --> 3651.42]  we don't pay dues
[3651.42 --> 3653.26]  into a fund or anything.
[3653.34 --> 3654.42]  Like, it's not formal, right?
[3654.42 --> 3655.62]  But I think as long as we,
[3655.96 --> 3657.10]  as long as we recognize
[3657.10 --> 3658.74]  that we're all on the same team,
[3658.84 --> 3659.64]  team consumer,
[3660.22 --> 3661.26]  and we,
[3661.34 --> 3662.88]  and we treat each other as such
[3662.88 --> 3664.52]  and we treat manufacturers,
[3664.74 --> 3666.06]  manufacturers as such,
[3666.10 --> 3667.08]  then I think there's,
[3667.86 --> 3670.26]  I think there's less risk
[3670.26 --> 3671.28]  that this can become
[3671.28 --> 3672.30]  a widespread problem.
[3672.64 --> 3672.80]  Yeah.
[3673.24 --> 3673.58]  Yeah, yeah.
[3675.50 --> 3675.90]  Okay.
[3676.46 --> 3676.90]  Okay.
[3677.16 --> 3678.76]  I'm going to give you two options
[3678.76 --> 3679.98]  for what we can do next.
[3679.98 --> 3682.78]  we can either,
[3682.98 --> 3685.12]  we can either
[3685.12 --> 3686.54]  talk about
[3686.54 --> 3688.62]  Scrapyard Wars Rise of Skywalker
[3688.62 --> 3692.78]  or
[3692.78 --> 3694.30]  we can talk about
[3694.30 --> 3695.40]  what happened here.
[3696.98 --> 3698.58]  Oh, man.
[3705.38 --> 3706.58]  I think, I think,
[3706.58 --> 3710.68]  I think we got to hang them
[3710.68 --> 3711.70]  on the hair a little bit
[3711.70 --> 3712.04]  and,
[3712.12 --> 3712.74]  and talk about
[3712.74 --> 3713.42]  Scrapyard Wars.
[3713.66 --> 3714.18]  All right.
[3714.20 --> 3714.98]  Because I think that's
[3714.98 --> 3716.42]  the funniest possible option
[3716.42 --> 3716.98]  out of the two.
[3717.14 --> 3717.90]  So guys,
[3718.76 --> 3721.02]  it's back.
[3721.68 --> 3722.88]  When you look from afar,
[3722.96 --> 3724.20]  I really don't look that different.
[3726.12 --> 3727.70]  I was thinking about this.
[3728.02 --> 3728.80]  I read a,
[3728.88 --> 3730.18]  I read a comment on it.
[3731.00 --> 3732.28]  You can see the reception
[3732.28 --> 3733.70]  pretty positive.
[3733.84 --> 3734.52]  This just went up
[3734.52 --> 3735.24]  a little while ago.
[3735.24 --> 3736.58]  I,
[3736.66 --> 3738.08]  I was reading a comment
[3738.08 --> 3739.02]  where someone said,
[3739.08 --> 3740.78]  Luke looks completely
[3740.78 --> 3741.98]  unrecognizable.
[3742.18 --> 3742.44]  Really?
[3742.44 --> 3742.74]  Linus,
[3742.78 --> 3743.86]  I can totally identify.
[3744.22 --> 3744.62]  Whoa,
[3744.68 --> 3745.74]  I feel completely different.
[3745.84 --> 3747.86]  And I feel completely differently
[3747.86 --> 3749.38]  and I was thinking about it
[3749.38 --> 3750.98]  and what I realized
[3750.98 --> 3751.98]  is that
[3751.98 --> 3753.60]  my wife,
[3753.68 --> 3754.86]  who I think is very beautiful,
[3755.06 --> 3756.34]  has kind of a funny nose.
[3757.82 --> 3759.04]  I am not really
[3759.04 --> 3759.92]  a nose person
[3759.92 --> 3762.52]  and your only prosthetic
[3762.52 --> 3763.50]  was the nose.
[3763.58 --> 3764.52]  is on your nose.
[3764.52 --> 3766.20]  I am such
[3766.20 --> 3767.42]  an eyes person.
[3767.42 --> 3768.32]  So coming back to
[3768.32 --> 3768.88]  my wife,
[3768.88 --> 3769.66]  who I think is
[3769.66 --> 3771.26]  spectacularly beautiful,
[3771.26 --> 3772.68]  I think she has
[3772.68 --> 3773.30]  some of the most
[3773.30 --> 3774.88]  amazing eyes ever.
[3775.12 --> 3776.26]  And that to me
[3776.26 --> 3777.30]  is very important.
[3777.30 --> 3778.40]  When I look at someone,
[3778.54 --> 3779.96]  I'm looking in their eyes,
[3780.08 --> 3781.50]  I'm looking at their eyes.
[3781.62 --> 3782.76]  So when I
[3782.76 --> 3784.10]  saw you here,
[3784.64 --> 3785.40]  I just saw
[3785.40 --> 3786.30]  Luke.
[3786.34 --> 3787.04]  I didn't even
[3787.04 --> 3787.84]  notice.
[3788.26 --> 3788.38]  Yeah.
[3788.38 --> 3789.58]  And I saw him in person.
[3789.94 --> 3791.18]  I didn't even know
[3791.18 --> 3793.08]  that you had a nose prosthetic
[3793.08 --> 3794.70]  until I watched the video
[3794.70 --> 3796.04]  and I watched them put it on.
[3796.12 --> 3796.74]  What's funny is
[3796.74 --> 3797.58]  I technically have
[3797.58 --> 3799.10]  three other prosthetics.
[3800.36 --> 3801.00]  If you look,
[3801.06 --> 3802.12]  they call them 11s.
[3802.74 --> 3803.68]  So right here.
[3804.68 --> 3805.18]  So you can see
[3805.18 --> 3805.72]  I have like,
[3805.78 --> 3806.54]  it almost looks like
[3806.54 --> 3807.04]  I'm frowning
[3807.04 --> 3807.92]  even though I'm not frowning.
[3808.02 --> 3808.28]  Oh yeah,
[3808.36 --> 3809.94]  I guess I have those too.
[3810.02 --> 3810.50]  They didn't tell me
[3810.50 --> 3811.08]  what they were called.
[3811.18 --> 3811.88]  We have those as well.
[3811.88 --> 3813.54]  And then I have fake eye bags,
[3813.66 --> 3814.54]  but I told her
[3814.54 --> 3815.42]  while she was doing them,
[3815.46 --> 3815.76]  I was like,
[3816.00 --> 3817.10]  I kind of just
[3817.10 --> 3818.88]  have eye bags all the time.
[3819.00 --> 3820.04]  So I was like,
[3820.10 --> 3820.90]  I don't think
[3820.90 --> 3821.50]  this is going to be
[3821.50 --> 3822.18]  a big sell.
[3822.66 --> 3823.88]  I can't even tell
[3823.88 --> 3824.74]  looking right now.
[3825.48 --> 3827.66]  Luke has the Superman disguise
[3827.66 --> 3828.90]  or like the fake nose
[3828.90 --> 3829.38]  and mustache.
[3829.58 --> 3829.66]  No,
[3830.00 --> 3831.64]  but for some people,
[3832.20 --> 3833.66]  my disguise is great
[3833.66 --> 3835.18]  and Luke's is junk
[3835.18 --> 3837.70]  and Luke's disguise is great
[3837.70 --> 3838.44]  and mine is junk.
[3838.54 --> 3839.12]  And don't worry guys,
[3839.64 --> 3840.80]  this is not much of a spoiler.
[3841.00 --> 3841.84]  It's in the thumbnail
[3841.84 --> 3843.02]  of the video that
[3843.02 --> 3844.72]  that's the angle
[3844.72 --> 3845.86]  that we've never told
[3845.86 --> 3846.60]  we've never told
[3846.60 --> 3847.30]  the broader audience.
[3847.54 --> 3847.66]  Oh,
[3847.90 --> 3850.18]  I didn't realize that.
[3850.38 --> 3850.70]  This,
[3851.00 --> 3851.54]  my friends,
[3852.14 --> 3852.90]  is how,
[3853.42 --> 3854.94]  this was like a dream.
[3855.32 --> 3856.06]  It came to me,
[3856.12 --> 3857.36]  it came to me during,
[3857.68 --> 3859.18]  during one of the
[3859.18 --> 3861.32]  like film production disruptions.
[3861.44 --> 3862.32]  I think it was
[3862.32 --> 3863.04]  the writers,
[3863.18 --> 3863.78]  the writer's strike
[3863.78 --> 3864.96]  or something like that.
[3865.00 --> 3865.28]  I forget,
[3865.42 --> 3865.96]  or it might've been
[3865.96 --> 3866.62]  one before that.
[3866.66 --> 3866.88]  Anyway,
[3867.32 --> 3867.80]  I like,
[3868.50 --> 3869.44]  like it was one of those
[3869.44 --> 3870.16]  like middle of the night.
[3870.18 --> 3871.06]  I need to write this down.
[3871.06 --> 3873.20]  This is how we bring back
[3873.20 --> 3874.04]  Scrapyard Wars.
[3874.48 --> 3875.82]  We add a makeup
[3875.82 --> 3876.92]  and effects budget.
[3878.08 --> 3879.82]  That's the only way
[3879.82 --> 3880.88]  to go back
[3880.88 --> 3882.16]  to reset the clock
[3882.16 --> 3883.10]  because like,
[3883.20 --> 3884.16]  that's the problem
[3884.16 --> 3884.98]  with basically
[3884.98 --> 3886.58]  any media franchise
[3886.58 --> 3888.28]  is they always have
[3888.28 --> 3889.38]  to increase the stakes.
[3889.94 --> 3890.02]  And,
[3890.02 --> 3891.38]  sorry,
[3891.48 --> 3891.66]  I just,
[3891.74 --> 3892.02]  I saw,
[3892.10 --> 3892.70]  I saw somebody
[3892.70 --> 3893.74]  and before we get too far
[3893.74 --> 3894.98]  off of just the makeup stuff,
[3895.28 --> 3896.08]  Bubbly Charizard said,
[3896.16 --> 3897.06]  Luke is definitely obvious,
[3897.18 --> 3898.46]  Linus is actually a bit different.
[3898.78 --> 3900.78]  My costume goes a little further
[3900.78 --> 3901.26]  than that.
[3901.36 --> 3901.60]  Yes.
[3902.18 --> 3902.58]  So,
[3903.70 --> 3904.50]  it's actually okay.
[3904.58 --> 3904.68]  Yeah,
[3904.68 --> 3905.74]  wait till he takes off his pants.
[3906.08 --> 3907.32]  He'll see some real prosthetics.
[3909.08 --> 3910.42]  Any media franchise
[3910.42 --> 3911.50]  It's not fake.
[3912.02 --> 3913.40]  eventually runs out of
[3913.40 --> 3914.34]  stakes to raise,
[3914.40 --> 3914.64]  right?
[3914.64 --> 3917.00]  Sorry,
[3917.16 --> 3917.86]  just dance.
[3919.34 --> 3920.54]  You went too early, Dan.
[3920.60 --> 3921.40]  We're gonna get him someday.
[3921.84 --> 3923.20]  That always happens.
[3931.48 --> 3932.30]  Oh no.
[3932.40 --> 3933.04]  Sorry, Luke,
[3933.14 --> 3933.92]  you're talking about
[3933.92 --> 3935.26]  your giant prosthesis?
[3941.36 --> 3942.04]  I'll wait.
[3942.04 --> 3943.16]  What were we,
[3943.16 --> 3944.80]  what were we even talking about?
[3945.14 --> 3946.16]  Every media franchise
[3946.16 --> 3947.52]  eventually runs out of
[3947.52 --> 3948.26]  stakes to raise.
[3948.36 --> 3948.80]  The Avengers
[3948.80 --> 3950.02]  save the town,
[3950.12 --> 3951.00]  then they save the country,
[3951.08 --> 3951.50]  then the world,
[3951.58 --> 3952.24]  then the universe,
[3952.50 --> 3952.86]  and then,
[3953.08 --> 3954.20]  and then what?
[3954.36 --> 3954.70]  Oh,
[3954.78 --> 3955.34]  I don't know,
[3955.42 --> 3956.52]  the multiverse,
[3956.84 --> 3958.02]  and now there's even more
[3958.02 --> 3958.98]  multiverses,
[3959.10 --> 3959.12]  or,
[3959.34 --> 3960.58]  I don't know,
[3960.62 --> 3960.72]  right?
[3961.06 --> 3961.74]  And then,
[3961.74 --> 3962.86]  and then it sort of,
[3962.88 --> 3964.04]  it sort of becomes
[3964.04 --> 3965.12]  so contrived
[3965.12 --> 3965.82]  that the stakes
[3965.82 --> 3966.96]  don't even feel real.
[3967.06 --> 3967.72]  We're gonna go into
[3967.72 --> 3969.08]  the quantum dimension.
[3969.74 --> 3970.24]  Who cares?
[3970.80 --> 3970.96]  Right?
[3971.06 --> 3971.20]  So,
[3971.20 --> 3971.74]  so you just,
[3971.80 --> 3972.42]  you just kind of,
[3972.54 --> 3973.90]  it loses relatability,
[3974.02 --> 3974.20]  right?
[3974.28 --> 3974.70]  And that's,
[3974.80 --> 3975.40]  I think that's what
[3975.40 --> 3976.24]  happened to Scrapyard Wars,
[3976.30 --> 3977.32]  is we kept trying to come up
[3977.32 --> 3979.40]  with a new and interesting twist
[3979.40 --> 3980.74]  when what people fell in love
[3980.74 --> 3981.32]  with was
[3981.32 --> 3982.42]  a simple,
[3982.88 --> 3983.66]  mano a mano,
[3984.00 --> 3985.74]  who can build the best computer
[3985.74 --> 3987.10]  for a relatable,
[3987.54 --> 3988.68]  realistic budget
[3988.68 --> 3990.40]  on a fixed timeline,
[3990.40 --> 3990.70]  and,
[3990.70 --> 3990.94]  and,
[3991.04 --> 3991.42]  and the,
[3991.46 --> 3992.32]  and the shenanigans
[3992.32 --> 3993.16]  and hijinks
[3993.16 --> 3995.08]  that just naturally arise
[3995.08 --> 3996.84]  from a situation like that.
[3996.84 --> 3997.96]  and so it,
[3997.96 --> 3999.16]  it just like came to me
[3999.16 --> 4000.28]  in the middle of the night,
[4000.92 --> 4001.12]  well,
[4001.14 --> 4001.92]  we just have to,
[4002.04 --> 4003.64]  we just have to be new people.
[4004.48 --> 4005.08]  We re,
[4005.12 --> 4005.78]  we reboot
[4005.78 --> 4007.50]  rather than
[4007.50 --> 4008.72]  try to continue.
[4009.18 --> 4009.28]  Yeah.
[4009.28 --> 4009.70]  So that,
[4010.26 --> 4011.78]  that is what Scrapyard Wars 9
[4011.78 --> 4013.30]  or Scrapyard Wars 2024
[4013.30 --> 4014.52]  is,
[4014.62 --> 4015.62]  is it's more of like
[4015.62 --> 4017.20]  a series reboot.
[4017.68 --> 4019.12]  Why did we ditch the number?
[4019.62 --> 4019.94]  Um,
[4020.04 --> 4021.38]  because the number
[4021.38 --> 4022.42]  is kind of meaningless.
[4023.02 --> 4024.08]  It's Scrapyard Wars 2024
[4024.08 --> 4025.24]  and then we'll probably
[4025.24 --> 4026.46]  change it in a month or two
[4026.46 --> 4027.54]  to Scrapyard Wars 9
[4027.54 --> 4028.32]  so that when people
[4028.32 --> 4029.08]  are going through the playlist
[4029.08 --> 4029.90]  it makes more sense.
[4030.10 --> 4031.20]  But as we're launching it,
[4031.24 --> 4031.86]  like the title
[4031.86 --> 4032.80]  for this one
[4032.80 --> 4034.04]  is going to be this
[4034.04 --> 4034.60]  for probably about
[4034.60 --> 4035.58]  the first 20 minutes
[4035.58 --> 4037.34]  because we want to try
[4037.34 --> 4037.86]  and get a little bit
[4037.86 --> 4038.48]  more momentum
[4038.48 --> 4040.88]  from like notification watchers.
[4041.08 --> 4041.20]  Yeah.
[4041.64 --> 4042.28]  And then we're going to
[4042.28 --> 4043.16]  change it after that
[4043.16 --> 4044.30]  and then there's another title
[4044.30 --> 4045.18]  that we're going to change it to
[4045.18 --> 4046.52]  probably a couple months after
[4046.52 --> 4047.66]  once the whole series is out.
[4047.72 --> 4048.58]  It seems good.
[4048.72 --> 4048.88]  Yeah.
[4048.96 --> 4049.68]  Seems wise.
[4049.84 --> 4049.94]  Yeah.
[4049.98 --> 4050.92]  We're trying to kind of
[4050.92 --> 4052.00]  kind of take advantage of that.
[4052.26 --> 4052.66]  But,
[4052.76 --> 4053.04]  um,
[4053.06 --> 4053.20]  yeah,
[4053.22 --> 4054.18]  a couple cool things.
[4054.32 --> 4054.80]  Don't worry.
[4054.90 --> 4055.46]  No spoilers,
[4055.64 --> 4055.96]  guys.
[4056.36 --> 4056.48]  Yeah.
[4056.48 --> 4056.88]  Um,
[4057.04 --> 4059.44]  Scrapyard Wars is back though.
[4059.44 --> 4060.12]  Unless you,
[4060.26 --> 4061.34]  unless you want to watch it.
[4061.70 --> 4062.06]  Um,
[4062.14 --> 4062.62]  this is,
[4062.70 --> 4064.06]  this is one of our most
[4064.06 --> 4066.20]  beloved series ever.
[4066.42 --> 4066.82]  Uh,
[4066.82 --> 4068.32]  it's back for a ninth run.
[4068.40 --> 4068.62]  Uh,
[4068.62 --> 4070.10]  we're going live next week
[4070.10 --> 4070.88]  with the first,
[4071.14 --> 4071.34]  uh,
[4071.34 --> 4072.88]  with the first part on YouTube.
[4073.26 --> 4074.60]  I don't remember exactly
[4074.60 --> 4075.54]  what day it will be,
[4075.62 --> 4077.88]  but it is on float plane already.
[4078.34 --> 4078.86]  And,
[4079.80 --> 4081.10]  also a throwback,
[4081.30 --> 4082.50]  we are bringing back
[4082.50 --> 4084.42]  early access on float plane
[4084.42 --> 4086.60]  for Scrapyard Wars specifically.
[4086.78 --> 4088.06]  It's not going to be a full week
[4088.06 --> 4089.16]  and I don't know that
[4089.16 --> 4089.84]  it's going to be
[4089.84 --> 4090.88]  completely consistent.
[4091.10 --> 4091.28]  Yeah.
[4091.42 --> 4093.34]  But what I can promise you guys
[4093.34 --> 4094.12]  is that,
[4094.12 --> 4094.62]  uh,
[4094.68 --> 4096.12]  float plane is going to be getting
[4096.12 --> 4099.32]  both access to Scrapyard Wars episodes
[4099.32 --> 4101.34]  before they are available on YouTube
[4101.34 --> 4102.54]  and it's going to be getting
[4102.54 --> 4103.28]  some extras.
[4103.40 --> 4103.70]  In fact,
[4104.28 --> 4104.92]  there was a,
[4104.92 --> 4105.12]  uh,
[4105.12 --> 4107.08]  there was a Reddit post today.
[4107.60 --> 4109.64]  Someone caught an accidental
[4109.64 --> 4112.50]  momentary making something live
[4112.50 --> 4114.28]  and then unmaking it live.
[4114.36 --> 4114.60]  Okay.
[4114.60 --> 4115.78]  So you do know about this.
[4116.28 --> 4116.60]  Um,
[4116.62 --> 4119.10]  so there was an extra piece of content
[4119.10 --> 4120.92]  that people saw the title,
[4121.04 --> 4121.94]  but nothing else,
[4121.94 --> 4122.30]  uh,
[4122.30 --> 4123.10]  on float plane today.
[4123.16 --> 4124.82]  If you're not familiar with float plane,
[4124.98 --> 4125.42]  it's,
[4125.54 --> 4125.76]  uh,
[4125.96 --> 4127.26]  do you really watch WAN show?
[4127.40 --> 4127.60]  Anyway,
[4127.60 --> 4127.88]  welcome,
[4127.98 --> 4128.80]  welcome to WAN show.
[4128.98 --> 4129.36]  Uh,
[4129.36 --> 4129.76]  if you don't,
[4129.86 --> 4131.02]  if you're not familiar with float plane,
[4131.14 --> 4131.54]  uh,
[4131.54 --> 4132.08]  it's our,
[4132.08 --> 4134.18]  our video platform that has,
[4134.18 --> 4134.78]  uh,
[4134.78 --> 4136.32]  videos from great content creators
[4136.32 --> 4138.40]  like LTT and TechWiki
[4138.40 --> 4139.48]  and Short Circuit
[4139.48 --> 4141.66]  and it's got lots of great exclusives
[4141.66 --> 4144.28]  that are not available anywhere else.
[4144.28 --> 4144.58]  Uh,
[4144.64 --> 4146.04]  extras from our AMD,
[4146.40 --> 4146.72]  uh,
[4146.72 --> 4148.56]  and Intel tech upgrades.
[4149.08 --> 4149.48]  Um,
[4150.40 --> 4152.14]  this cool series called closer look
[4152.14 --> 4153.56]  where the writer is getting into
[4153.56 --> 4154.42]  a little bit more depth
[4154.42 --> 4155.60]  than we can really get into
[4155.60 --> 4156.54]  super cool
[4156.54 --> 4157.58]  in the YouTube video
[4157.58 --> 4158.76]  because something's,
[4158.86 --> 4159.02]  you know,
[4159.02 --> 4160.18]  something's got to get cut.
[4160.68 --> 4161.02]  Um,
[4161.22 --> 4162.70]  we've done Dan week and Luke week
[4162.70 --> 4164.82]  where we focused in on some fan favorites
[4164.82 --> 4165.74]  and talked about,
[4165.84 --> 4166.06]  you know,
[4166.06 --> 4167.42]  their cars and their hobbies
[4167.42 --> 4168.58]  and their birds
[4168.58 --> 4170.16]  and cool stuff like that.
[4170.22 --> 4170.48]  So there's,
[4170.60 --> 4172.22]  there's literally,
[4172.56 --> 4174.08]  are there literally hundreds
[4174.08 --> 4176.14]  of exclusive videos to watch?
[4176.24 --> 4176.70]  there's close to a thousand,
[4176.84 --> 4177.02]  I think.
[4177.06 --> 4177.22]  Yeah.
[4177.44 --> 4178.16]  So it's,
[4178.26 --> 4179.20]  it's pretty awesome.
[4179.40 --> 4179.78]  Uh,
[4179.78 --> 4180.54]  behind the design,
[4180.66 --> 4181.58]  LTT scubby screwdriver
[4181.58 --> 4182.96]  featuring the one and only
[4182.96 --> 4183.78]  Kyle Therrett.
[4183.92 --> 4184.28]  There's,
[4184.36 --> 4184.86]  there's so much,
[4184.92 --> 4185.70]  there's so much good stuff
[4185.70 --> 4186.08]  over there.
[4186.12 --> 4186.32]  Anyway,
[4186.44 --> 4187.12]  Scrapyard Wars,
[4187.44 --> 4188.00]  sign up.
[4188.16 --> 4189.24]  Now's the time to do it.
[4190.06 --> 4190.46]  Uh,
[4190.50 --> 4190.76]  oh yeah,
[4190.78 --> 4190.96]  right.
[4191.00 --> 4191.62]  So we're going to talk,
[4191.74 --> 4192.44]  I mean,
[4192.46 --> 4193.30]  what are we talking about?
[4193.88 --> 4194.28]  Um,
[4195.76 --> 4196.86]  airing on something,
[4197.02 --> 4197.32]  something,
[4197.42 --> 4199.70]  later today,
[4199.80 --> 4200.64]  later today,
[4200.64 --> 4202.32]  there's going to be 70 minutes
[4202.32 --> 4204.10]  of additional exclusive content
[4204.10 --> 4206.16]  with much more coming each week.
[4206.84 --> 4208.10]  Today on float plane.
[4208.24 --> 4208.82]  Do you know about this?
[4208.96 --> 4209.60]  For Scrapyard Wars?
[4209.72 --> 4210.08]  Apparently.
[4210.44 --> 4211.42]  70 minutes?
[4212.88 --> 4213.84]  I mean,
[4214.10 --> 4215.96]  I was talking basically continuously
[4215.96 --> 4217.18]  while I was in the makeup chair
[4217.18 --> 4217.84]  for four hours.
[4217.90 --> 4218.60]  I don't know about you.
[4219.06 --> 4220.86]  So that doesn't surprise me that much.
[4220.86 --> 4221.18]  I was,
[4221.22 --> 4222.94]  I was sick for the whole thing.
[4223.04 --> 4224.36]  So there was definitely times
[4224.36 --> 4225.78]  where I was recouping energy
[4225.78 --> 4227.38]  so that I could be more energetic
[4227.38 --> 4228.52]  for the camera next time.
[4228.62 --> 4230.02]  So I definitely probably
[4230.02 --> 4231.20]  wasn't talking as much,
[4231.28 --> 4232.00]  but I think,
[4232.22 --> 4232.66]  I think,
[4232.72 --> 4233.02]  uh,
[4234.32 --> 4235.94]  I made sure there was some juice.
[4236.28 --> 4236.82]  This time around,
[4236.82 --> 4237.84]  we've partnered with the folks
[4237.84 --> 4238.52]  at Jawa
[4238.52 --> 4240.24]  and we'll be launching giveaways
[4240.24 --> 4241.78]  and other exciting bonuses
[4241.78 --> 4243.16]  throughout the run.
[4243.16 --> 4244.68]  So stay tuned for more information
[4244.68 --> 4245.16]  on that.
[4245.52 --> 4246.92]  Their giveaway is going to start
[4246.92 --> 4248.14]  when the YouTube release drops,
[4248.22 --> 4248.72]  but in the meantime,
[4248.84 --> 4249.58]  you can check them out
[4249.58 --> 4251.16]  and sign up for float plane
[4251.16 --> 4253.26]  at the links in the video description.
[4254.32 --> 4255.12]  Super excited.
[4256.46 --> 4256.86]  Now,
[4257.00 --> 4259.50]  what would you like to do next?
[4260.26 --> 4262.06]  I guess we just keep going through,
[4262.38 --> 4263.66]  we got to get rid of these articles
[4263.66 --> 4264.82]  so we can just start powering through.
[4264.82 --> 4265.86]  Should we do the thing on After Dark?
[4267.10 --> 4268.38]  Let's do the thing on After Dark.
[4268.60 --> 4269.50]  What thing on After Dark?
[4270.00 --> 4271.40]  How do you keep forgetting about this?
[4272.78 --> 4273.14]  Oh,
[4273.38 --> 4273.66]  oh,
[4273.94 --> 4274.22]  oh,
[4274.52 --> 4274.82]  oh.
[4275.24 --> 4275.58]  It's not,
[4275.72 --> 4277.38]  how do you keep forgetting about this?
[4277.38 --> 4279.08]  I literally can't see it at all.
[4279.12 --> 4279.84]  It's on my mind.
[4279.84 --> 4280.94]  completely occluded.
[4285.18 --> 4285.50]  Yeah,
[4285.54 --> 4285.74]  I mean,
[4285.76 --> 4286.30]  let's do it.
[4286.58 --> 4286.80]  No,
[4286.84 --> 4286.96]  no,
[4286.96 --> 4287.70]  let's do it After Dark.
[4287.94 --> 4288.20]  Really?
[4288.28 --> 4288.88]  We're doing it After Dark,
[4288.92 --> 4289.06]  yeah.
[4289.94 --> 4290.10]  Yeah,
[4290.12 --> 4290.52]  I'm going to string them along.
[4290.52 --> 4291.28]  I guess After Dark
[4291.28 --> 4292.32]  doesn't have to be
[4292.32 --> 4292.96]  just merge messages.
[4292.98 --> 4293.82]  Y'all just got strung.
[4293.96 --> 4294.94]  It can be whatever we want.
[4295.14 --> 4296.48]  Y'all got a long strung.
[4297.14 --> 4297.38]  Yeah.
[4297.56 --> 4298.16]  All right.
[4298.72 --> 4299.02]  All right,
[4299.02 --> 4299.82]  let's do a topic then.
[4299.90 --> 4300.40]  What do we got?
[4300.64 --> 4301.68]  Record companies
[4301.68 --> 4303.60]  are suing Verizon
[4303.60 --> 4305.16]  and this is like
[4305.16 --> 4306.02]  two point,
[4306.06 --> 4307.06]  this is a billions
[4307.06 --> 4309.04]  of dollars lawsuit here
[4309.04 --> 4310.60]  and they are suing Verizon
[4310.60 --> 4313.08]  for not shutting off
[4313.08 --> 4314.24]  pirates'
[4314.88 --> 4315.84]  internet service.
[4316.42 --> 4317.68]  Universal Music Group,
[4317.96 --> 4318.96]  Warner Music Group
[4318.96 --> 4320.16]  and Sony Music
[4320.16 --> 4321.40]  are suing Verizon
[4321.40 --> 4322.76]  for two point six
[4322.76 --> 4324.20]  billion dollars
[4324.20 --> 4324.80]  in damages
[4324.80 --> 4325.76]  on the grounds
[4325.76 --> 4326.34]  that Verizon
[4326.34 --> 4327.16]  has profited
[4327.16 --> 4328.34]  from continuing
[4328.34 --> 4329.26]  to provide service
[4329.26 --> 4330.14]  to thousands
[4330.14 --> 4331.02]  of customers
[4331.02 --> 4332.06]  that are engaged in
[4332.06 --> 4333.24]  flagrant
[4333.24 --> 4334.36]  and repeat
[4334.36 --> 4335.36]  piracy.
[4335.36 --> 4337.16]  The legal strength
[4337.16 --> 4337.72]  of this argument
[4337.72 --> 4339.12]  is currently unclear
[4339.12 --> 4340.34]  but it has been tested
[4340.34 --> 4341.96]  in another very similar case.
[4342.42 --> 4343.24]  A few years ago,
[4343.50 --> 4344.70]  these same record companies
[4344.70 --> 4346.04]  sued Cox Communications
[4346.04 --> 4347.12]  on similar grounds.
[4347.72 --> 4348.66]  The court found
[4348.66 --> 4350.26]  that Cox was guilty
[4350.26 --> 4351.76]  of failing to stop
[4351.76 --> 4352.56]  privacy,
[4352.74 --> 4353.26]  privacy,
[4353.50 --> 4354.00]  piracy.
[4354.62 --> 4354.92]  However,
[4355.08 --> 4356.20]  the damages were overturned
[4356.20 --> 4356.58]  on appeal
[4356.58 --> 4357.64]  because the record companies
[4357.64 --> 4358.64]  failed to prove
[4358.64 --> 4359.18]  that Cox
[4359.18 --> 4360.84]  directly profited
[4360.84 --> 4361.98]  from the infringement,
[4362.14 --> 4362.52]  i.e.
[4362.88 --> 4364.26]  Cox makes more money
[4364.26 --> 4365.36]  because it didn't punish
[4365.36 --> 4366.12]  its paying customers
[4366.12 --> 4367.20]  but it doesn't make
[4367.20 --> 4368.00]  more money from a customer
[4368.00 --> 4368.68]  who commits piracy
[4368.68 --> 4370.04]  than one who doesn't.
[4370.84 --> 4372.66]  If they win this time,
[4373.66 --> 4379.82]  this could be crushing.
[4380.32 --> 4382.18]  The biggest sale
[4382.18 --> 4383.60]  of VPNs ever?
[4384.00 --> 4384.30]  Yeah.
[4385.12 --> 4386.08]  Did I mention,
[4386.24 --> 4386.68]  by the way,
[4386.84 --> 4387.66]  PIA!
[4387.96 --> 4388.50]  Our partner,
[4388.60 --> 4389.52]  Private Internet Access.
[4389.64 --> 4390.14]  Hey, Dan,
[4390.20 --> 4391.12]  do we have a PIA link
[4391.12 --> 4391.86]  in the video description?
[4391.86 --> 4393.20]  If not,
[4393.28 --> 4394.40]  please make sure we do.
[4396.08 --> 4397.84]  A VPN is...
[4397.84 --> 4398.94]  I just copy-paste.
[4399.12 --> 4400.68]  A VPN is absolutely
[4400.68 --> 4402.60]  not the silver bullet
[4402.60 --> 4404.88]  to your online privacy
[4404.88 --> 4405.92]  and security woes.
[4405.94 --> 4406.92]  We actually do, yes.
[4407.02 --> 4407.64]  Good, excellent.
[4407.74 --> 4408.30]  It's down there.
[4408.56 --> 4410.12]  But what it absolutely is
[4410.12 --> 4411.34]  is a way of keeping
[4411.34 --> 4412.16]  your ISP
[4412.16 --> 4412.80]  from snooping
[4412.80 --> 4413.82]  on exactly
[4413.82 --> 4415.58]  which ones and zeros
[4415.58 --> 4417.08]  are being downloaded
[4417.08 --> 4418.40]  to your drive
[4418.40 --> 4419.94]  and in what order.
[4419.94 --> 4421.86]  So it is a great way
[4421.86 --> 4422.76]  to prevent
[4422.76 --> 4424.30]  something like this
[4424.30 --> 4425.62]  from impacting you
[4425.62 --> 4426.66]  in the future.
[4428.00 --> 4429.08]  What else is there
[4429.08 --> 4429.88]  for us to really say
[4429.88 --> 4430.44]  about this
[4430.44 --> 4431.02]  other than
[4431.02 --> 4431.90]  this, yeah,
[4431.96 --> 4433.16]  sounds absolutely terrible
[4433.16 --> 4433.68]  for normies
[4433.68 --> 4434.14]  who don't know
[4434.14 --> 4434.94]  about VPNs.
[4436.28 --> 4436.84]  Yeah.
[4437.52 --> 4438.50]  MMO Publisher
[4438.50 --> 4439.48]  says Intel
[4439.48 --> 4440.18]  is selling
[4440.18 --> 4442.16]  defective chips.
[4442.34 --> 4442.90]  Yeah.
[4443.72 --> 4444.76]  Alderaan Games
[4444.76 --> 4445.80]  says that it is
[4445.80 --> 4446.66]  switching its
[4446.66 --> 4447.64]  Intel 13th
[4447.64 --> 4448.88]  and 14th gen servers
[4448.88 --> 4449.74]  and we touched on this
[4449.74 --> 4450.52]  last week
[4450.52 --> 4452.46]  when I hadn't
[4452.46 --> 4453.30]  watched the Level 1
[4453.30 --> 4454.20]  text video yet
[4454.20 --> 4455.20]  but we did talk about
[4455.20 --> 4455.74]  how Wendell from
[4455.74 --> 4456.50]  Level 1 text
[4456.50 --> 4458.48]  has been talking about
[4458.48 --> 4459.64]  how Intel's 13th
[4459.64 --> 4460.62]  and 14th gen chips
[4460.62 --> 4461.52]  are having some
[4461.52 --> 4462.40]  serious problems.
[4462.88 --> 4463.72]  Well, Alderaan
[4463.72 --> 4464.60]  says that they are
[4464.60 --> 4465.70]  switching them out
[4465.70 --> 4466.34]  for AMD
[4466.34 --> 4467.90]  following significant
[4467.90 --> 4468.86]  stability issues.
[4469.34 --> 4470.42]  According to Alderaan,
[4470.72 --> 4471.32]  their servers
[4471.32 --> 4471.82]  have had
[4471.82 --> 4473.16]  extremely high
[4473.16 --> 4473.92]  failure rates
[4473.92 --> 4474.64]  which is
[4474.64 --> 4475.42]  overwhelmingly
[4475.42 --> 4477.04]  due to errors
[4477.04 --> 4478.22]  from Intel chips
[4478.22 --> 4479.34]  and I can hear
[4479.34 --> 4479.84]  you already
[4479.84 --> 4480.30]  asking
[4480.30 --> 4481.58]  why the devil
[4481.58 --> 4482.64]  is Alderaan
[4482.64 --> 4483.18]  games
[4483.18 --> 4484.16]  using
[4484.16 --> 4487.14]  Core i7s
[4487.14 --> 4488.86]  and Core i9s
[4488.86 --> 4489.64]  for servers?
[4490.60 --> 4491.62]  That's not as crazy
[4491.62 --> 4492.40]  as you might think.
[4493.24 --> 4493.82]  It's actually
[4493.82 --> 4494.66]  I still
[4494.66 --> 4496.36]  while Intel
[4496.36 --> 4497.00]  and AMD
[4497.00 --> 4498.12]  have at times
[4498.12 --> 4498.76]  certainly
[4498.76 --> 4499.96]  and especially
[4499.96 --> 4500.34]  NVIDIA
[4500.34 --> 4501.52]  have certainly
[4501.52 --> 4502.40]  put pressure
[4502.40 --> 4503.38]  on bare bones
[4503.38 --> 4504.54]  chassis manufacturers
[4504.54 --> 4505.94]  and solution
[4505.94 --> 4506.54]  providers
[4506.54 --> 4509.50]  to steer
[4509.50 --> 4510.38]  their clients
[4510.38 --> 4511.18]  toward
[4511.18 --> 4512.50]  Xeon
[4512.50 --> 4513.76]  and Epic
[4513.76 --> 4515.22]  and I don't know
[4515.22 --> 4516.26]  what's NVIDIA's
[4516.26 --> 4516.94]  branding even?
[4517.04 --> 4517.58]  It's not Tesla
[4517.58 --> 4518.46]  anymore but whatever.
[4518.80 --> 4519.84]  What's their branding
[4519.84 --> 4520.44]  for their GPS?
[4520.82 --> 4521.28]  Grid,
[4521.52 --> 4522.04]  who knows?
[4522.74 --> 4523.78]  But their enterprise
[4523.78 --> 4524.28]  solutions,
[4524.38 --> 4524.94]  while they certainly
[4524.94 --> 4525.66]  steer them,
[4526.38 --> 4527.34]  sometimes those
[4527.34 --> 4528.22]  enterprise solutions
[4528.22 --> 4529.22]  don't necessarily
[4529.22 --> 4530.20]  make the most sense
[4530.20 --> 4531.12]  and in the case
[4531.12 --> 4531.68]  of something like
[4531.68 --> 4532.42]  a game server
[4532.42 --> 4533.68]  where performance
[4533.68 --> 4535.18]  and value
[4535.18 --> 4536.24]  might be more
[4536.24 --> 4537.20]  meaningful to you
[4537.20 --> 4537.66]  than running
[4537.66 --> 4538.58]  ECC memory
[4538.58 --> 4539.82]  for the utmost
[4539.82 --> 4540.56]  instability,
[4541.34 --> 4542.54]  it could make
[4542.54 --> 4543.66]  sense to deploy
[4543.66 --> 4547.12]  just like
[4547.12 --> 4548.08]  one use
[4548.08 --> 4549.12]  of game servers
[4549.12 --> 4549.54]  or even
[4549.54 --> 4551.68]  I think I've seen
[4551.68 --> 4552.46]  ones that are like
[4552.46 --> 4553.92]  four
[4553.92 --> 4555.04]  four and a one
[4555.04 --> 4555.34]  you
[4555.34 --> 4555.86]  or
[4555.86 --> 4556.92]  oh we looked at
[4556.92 --> 4557.36]  oh man
[4557.36 --> 4557.82]  what was that
[4557.82 --> 4558.32]  cool one
[4558.32 --> 4558.98]  that we looked at
[4558.98 --> 4561.02]  from Supermicro
[4561.02 --> 4561.78]  it was about a year
[4561.78 --> 4562.90]  ago but it was a
[4562.90 --> 4563.56]  bunch of just like
[4563.56 --> 4564.14]  Ryzens
[4564.14 --> 4566.62]  in little like
[4566.62 --> 4567.28]  blades
[4567.28 --> 4568.36]  super cool
[4568.36 --> 4568.70]  anyway
[4568.70 --> 4570.10]  the point is
[4570.10 --> 4570.60]  that it is
[4570.60 --> 4572.12]  way more common
[4572.12 --> 4572.64]  than you would
[4572.64 --> 4573.32]  think to run
[4573.32 --> 4574.26]  desktop chips
[4574.26 --> 4576.74]  so let's have a
[4576.74 --> 4577.44]  look at what
[4577.44 --> 4578.04]  the breakdown
[4578.04 --> 4578.82]  is here
[4578.82 --> 4581.56]  in Alderaan's
[4581.56 --> 4582.02]  testing
[4582.02 --> 4582.66]  the chips
[4582.66 --> 4583.56]  initially worked
[4583.56 --> 4584.06]  fine
[4584.06 --> 4585.08]  but later
[4585.08 --> 4586.08]  deteriorated
[4586.08 --> 4586.96]  failing at a
[4586.96 --> 4587.38]  rate of
[4587.38 --> 4587.94]  nearly
[4587.94 --> 4590.16]  100%
[4590.16 --> 4591.34]  and you
[4591.34 --> 4591.82]  can see
[4591.82 --> 4592.10]  here
[4592.10 --> 4593.02]  which models
[4593.02 --> 4593.82]  seem to be
[4593.82 --> 4594.28]  the most
[4594.28 --> 4595.44]  likely to be
[4595.44 --> 4596.00]  affected
[4596.00 --> 4596.64]  although we
[4596.64 --> 4597.40]  don't know
[4597.40 --> 4598.04]  what exactly
[4598.04 --> 4599.00]  the mix is
[4599.00 --> 4599.96]  of their
[4599.96 --> 4600.48]  deployment
[4600.48 --> 4600.88]  so
[4600.88 --> 4603.10]  the K's
[4603.10 --> 4603.98]  and this is
[4603.98 --> 4604.76]  already something
[4604.76 --> 4606.40]  that has been
[4606.40 --> 4607.22]  touched on
[4607.22 --> 4608.62]  K's seem to be
[4608.62 --> 4609.44]  experiencing the
[4609.44 --> 4610.10]  worst failures
[4610.10 --> 4611.34]  the lower core
[4611.34 --> 4612.12]  count lower
[4612.12 --> 4613.08]  clocked skews
[4613.08 --> 4613.72]  seem to be
[4613.72 --> 4614.76]  impacted less
[4614.76 --> 4617.62]  and according
[4617.62 --> 4618.28]  to level one
[4618.28 --> 4618.92]  text this
[4618.92 --> 4620.16]  looks like
[4620.16 --> 4620.80]  hardware
[4620.80 --> 4621.62]  we talked
[4621.62 --> 4622.00]  about this
[4622.00 --> 4622.62]  last week
[4622.62 --> 4623.24]  about you
[4623.24 --> 4623.48]  know
[4623.48 --> 4624.08]  Intel
[4624.08 --> 4625.22]  could need
[4625.22 --> 4625.62]  to do a
[4625.62 --> 4626.18]  recall here
[4626.18 --> 4626.66]  if they can't
[4626.66 --> 4627.20]  figure out how
[4627.20 --> 4627.80]  to fix this
[4627.80 --> 4629.40]  good lord
[4629.40 --> 4630.30]  what would
[4630.30 --> 4630.76]  this look
[4630.76 --> 4631.06]  like
[4631.06 --> 4632.50]  I don't
[4632.50 --> 4633.28]  think in
[4633.28 --> 4634.12]  my time
[4634.12 --> 4635.20]  as a
[4635.20 --> 4635.60]  PC
[4635.60 --> 4636.74]  enthusiast
[4636.74 --> 4638.52]  I have
[4638.52 --> 4639.12]  seen
[4639.12 --> 4640.08]  such a
[4640.08 --> 4640.34]  high
[4640.34 --> 4640.86]  CPUs are
[4640.86 --> 4641.96]  always rock
[4641.96 --> 4642.26]  solid
[4642.26 --> 4643.32]  like
[4643.32 --> 4644.68]  well
[4644.68 --> 4645.18]  here's the
[4645.18 --> 4645.68]  exception that
[4645.68 --> 4645.98]  proves the
[4645.98 --> 4646.10]  rule
[4646.10 --> 4646.68]  well no
[4646.68 --> 4647.12]  there's been
[4647.12 --> 4647.68]  bad stuff
[4647.68 --> 4648.20]  I thought
[4648.20 --> 4648.80]  copper mine
[4648.80 --> 4649.36]  was a huge
[4649.36 --> 4649.96]  disaster
[4649.96 --> 4651.52]  what was that
[4651.52 --> 4652.96]  Pentium 3
[4652.96 --> 4653.38]  yeah
[4653.38 --> 4654.22]  that's what I'm
[4654.22 --> 4654.46]  saying
[4654.46 --> 4655.22]  like in
[4655.22 --> 4656.00]  pretty much
[4656.00 --> 4658.00]  like that was
[4658.00 --> 4658.56]  before I was in
[4658.56 --> 4659.08]  high school
[4659.08 --> 4659.98]  that's 25
[4659.98 --> 4660.60]  years ago
[4660.60 --> 4661.20]  it's been a
[4661.20 --> 4662.06]  decent assumption
[4662.06 --> 4663.10]  that your CPU
[4663.10 --> 4663.78]  is like not
[4663.78 --> 4664.20]  really the
[4664.20 --> 4664.54]  problem
[4664.54 --> 4666.02]  for a
[4666.02 --> 4666.66]  long time
[4666.66 --> 4668.38]  absolutely
[4668.38 --> 4668.98]  freaking
[4668.98 --> 4669.94]  wild man
[4669.94 --> 4671.74]  I just
[4671.74 --> 4672.54]  yeah I have
[4672.54 --> 4673.20]  absolutely no
[4673.20 --> 4673.72]  idea what this
[4673.72 --> 4674.16]  would look like
[4674.16 --> 4675.78]  because you
[4675.78 --> 4676.58]  got to go a
[4676.58 --> 4677.44]  step beyond
[4677.44 --> 4679.12]  just you
[4679.12 --> 4679.64]  know oh
[4679.64 --> 4680.32]  well you
[4680.32 --> 4680.86]  know Intel
[4680.86 --> 4681.94]  takes the
[4681.94 --> 4682.42]  chips back
[4682.42 --> 4683.32]  right like
[4683.32 --> 4683.86]  that that's a
[4683.86 --> 4684.48]  recall right
[4684.48 --> 4687.72]  no what
[4687.72 --> 4688.26]  is good what
[4688.26 --> 4688.62]  are they gonna
[4688.62 --> 4689.10]  what are they
[4689.10 --> 4689.80]  gonna issue
[4689.80 --> 4691.04]  people in
[4691.04 --> 4692.52]  exchange like
[4692.52 --> 4692.88]  what are they
[4692.88 --> 4693.50]  gonna give them
[4693.50 --> 4693.88]  now is there
[4693.88 --> 4694.30]  an inherent
[4694.30 --> 4695.30]  flaw there's
[4695.30 --> 4696.08]  there's a
[4696.08 --> 4697.22]  there's like
[4697.22 --> 4697.78]  okay okay
[4697.78 --> 4698.50]  like let's look
[4698.50 --> 4698.94]  at it from a
[4698.94 --> 4699.24]  couple of
[4699.24 --> 4699.74]  different angles
[4699.74 --> 4700.60]  like recall
[4700.60 --> 4701.00]  the car
[4701.00 --> 4701.54]  replace the
[4701.54 --> 4702.02]  airbag and
[4702.02 --> 4702.36]  give you the
[4702.36 --> 4702.80]  car back
[4702.80 --> 4703.66]  yeah I like
[4703.66 --> 4704.40]  I've got my
[4704.40 --> 4705.28]  let's say I'm
[4705.28 --> 4706.00]  I'm an end
[4706.00 --> 4706.50]  user customer
[4706.50 --> 4706.98]  okay I
[4706.98 --> 4707.60]  bought a
[4707.60 --> 4708.36]  motherboard from
[4708.36 --> 4709.42]  gigabyte and
[4709.42 --> 4710.20]  some crucial
[4710.20 --> 4710.86]  memory and I
[4710.86 --> 4711.22]  see sonic
[4711.22 --> 4711.66]  power supply
[4711.66 --> 4712.02]  I've got my
[4712.02 --> 4712.54]  computer here
[4712.54 --> 4713.60]  right and
[4713.60 --> 4714.38]  and I got
[4714.38 --> 4714.88]  this bad
[4714.88 --> 4715.56]  Intel chip
[4715.56 --> 4716.00]  and I need
[4716.00 --> 4716.54]  I need a
[4716.54 --> 4716.82]  new one
[4716.82 --> 4717.34]  Intel here
[4717.34 --> 4717.64]  you go
[4717.64 --> 4718.06]  you got my
[4718.06 --> 4718.28]  chip
[4718.28 --> 4720.14]  well now
[4720.14 --> 4720.38]  what
[4720.38 --> 4722.20]  they send
[4722.20 --> 4722.56]  back a
[4722.56 --> 4723.00]  fixed one
[4723.00 --> 4723.68]  well no
[4723.68 --> 4725.06]  you this
[4725.06 --> 4725.54]  is the
[4725.54 --> 4727.94]  Intel's R&D
[4727.94 --> 4728.48]  teams
[4728.48 --> 4729.56]  okay are
[4729.56 --> 4730.02]  working on
[4730.02 --> 4730.68]  CPUs that
[4730.68 --> 4730.98]  are coming
[4730.98 --> 4731.34]  out next
[4731.34 --> 4731.84]  year the
[4731.84 --> 4732.36]  year after
[4732.36 --> 4732.78]  and the
[4732.78 --> 4733.16]  year after
[4733.16 --> 4734.76]  that that
[4734.76 --> 4735.12]  gives you
[4735.12 --> 4735.90]  some idea
[4735.90 --> 4736.76]  of how
[4736.76 --> 4737.60]  long you're
[4737.60 --> 4738.10]  working on
[4738.10 --> 4738.58]  a chip
[4738.58 --> 4739.72]  before it
[4739.72 --> 4740.20]  ever sees
[4740.20 --> 4740.52]  the light
[4740.52 --> 4740.96]  of day
[4740.96 --> 4742.52]  just the
[4742.52 --> 4743.02]  the spin-up
[4743.02 --> 4743.36]  time if you
[4743.36 --> 4743.76]  watched our
[4743.76 --> 4744.36]  Intel fab
[4744.36 --> 4745.08]  tour the
[4745.08 --> 4745.80]  spin-up time
[4745.80 --> 4746.80]  from okay
[4746.80 --> 4747.70]  we've got
[4747.70 --> 4748.44]  the design
[4748.44 --> 4749.54]  finished and
[4749.54 --> 4751.02]  now at least
[4751.02 --> 4752.12]  in principle
[4752.12 --> 4753.08]  and now we
[4753.08 --> 4753.64]  need a physical
[4753.64 --> 4754.44]  one in order
[4754.44 --> 4754.90]  to try to
[4754.90 --> 4755.60]  power it on
[4755.60 --> 4756.92]  is I
[4756.92 --> 4757.26]  forget if
[4757.26 --> 4757.50]  it was
[4757.50 --> 4758.00]  weeks or
[4758.00 --> 4759.94]  months but
[4759.94 --> 4760.50]  it's a long
[4760.50 --> 4761.16]  flipping time
[4761.16 --> 4761.84]  because all of
[4761.84 --> 4762.20]  the different
[4762.20 --> 4762.96]  steps that are
[4762.96 --> 4763.66]  required to
[4763.66 --> 4764.60]  manufacture a
[4764.60 --> 4765.30]  modern processor
[4765.30 --> 4766.02]  for Intel to
[4766.02 --> 4767.56]  fix this in
[4767.56 --> 4768.32]  hardware
[4768.32 --> 4771.12]  they would
[4771.12 --> 4771.74]  this is
[4771.74 --> 4772.96]  enormously
[4772.96 --> 4773.60]  costly
[4773.60 --> 4773.94]  they're gonna
[4773.94 --> 4774.36]  have they
[4774.36 --> 4774.72]  would have to
[4774.72 --> 4775.48]  pull teams
[4775.48 --> 4776.34]  that are
[4776.34 --> 4776.92]  working on
[4776.92 --> 4777.90]  future products
[4777.90 --> 4779.18]  and get them
[4779.18 --> 4780.48]  essentially back
[4780.48 --> 4781.94]  on the CPU
[4781.94 --> 4783.10]  design of
[4783.10 --> 4783.74]  13th and
[4783.74 --> 4784.66]  14th gen
[4784.66 --> 4786.00]  and even if
[4786.00 --> 4786.74]  they did that
[4786.74 --> 4787.42]  yesterday
[4787.42 --> 4788.86]  it would be
[4788.86 --> 4790.64]  months before
[4790.64 --> 4791.30]  they would have
[4791.30 --> 4792.24]  a single unit
[4792.24 --> 4792.76]  to ship to
[4792.76 --> 4793.88]  anyone and
[4793.88 --> 4794.10]  when you
[4794.10 --> 4794.68]  consider how
[4794.68 --> 4795.10]  much of their
[4795.10 --> 4796.36]  manufacturing capacity
[4796.36 --> 4797.00]  would have been
[4797.00 --> 4798.28]  used over the
[4798.28 --> 4799.30]  last couple of
[4799.30 --> 4800.80]  years to ship
[4800.80 --> 4801.40]  all the chips
[4801.40 --> 4801.92]  that they had
[4801.92 --> 4803.22]  it would be
[4803.22 --> 4805.14]  months-er
[4805.14 --> 4806.66]  maybe even a
[4806.66 --> 4807.30]  year plus
[4807.30 --> 4808.06]  before they could
[4808.06 --> 4809.12]  actually manufacture
[4809.12 --> 4809.78]  enough of these
[4809.78 --> 4810.46]  bloody things
[4810.46 --> 4811.74]  in order to
[4811.74 --> 4812.82]  issue all the
[4812.82 --> 4814.38]  fixes so in
[4814.38 --> 4814.96]  the meantime
[4814.96 --> 4815.92]  imagine you
[4815.92 --> 4817.18]  are not a
[4817.18 --> 4817.80]  gamer who
[4817.80 --> 4818.24]  just bought
[4818.24 --> 4818.88]  one chip and
[4818.88 --> 4819.38]  put it in your
[4819.38 --> 4819.94]  computer and
[4819.94 --> 4820.22]  are kind of
[4820.22 --> 4820.58]  going where
[4820.58 --> 4821.10]  the devil's my
[4821.10 --> 4821.94]  chip now
[4821.94 --> 4822.66]  imagine that
[4822.66 --> 4822.98]  you're a
[4822.98 --> 4823.56]  customer like
[4823.56 --> 4824.40]  the United
[4824.40 --> 4824.98]  States government
[4824.98 --> 4826.70]  or Dell
[4826.70 --> 4828.54]  your expectations
[4828.54 --> 4829.08]  are now
[4829.08 --> 4830.08]  completely different
[4830.08 --> 4830.72]  and there's a
[4830.72 --> 4832.34]  huge cost to
[4832.34 --> 4832.80]  you especially
[4832.80 --> 4833.04]  if you're
[4833.04 --> 4833.34]  someone like
[4833.34 --> 4833.78]  an OEM
[4833.78 --> 4834.28]  like a Dell
[4834.28 --> 4834.86]  or Lenovo
[4834.86 --> 4836.44]  HP the
[4836.44 --> 4837.24]  cost to you
[4837.24 --> 4837.96]  of these
[4837.96 --> 4838.54]  systems that
[4838.54 --> 4839.14]  you've designed
[4839.14 --> 4839.68]  around this
[4839.68 --> 4840.40]  now defective
[4840.40 --> 4843.08]  part is
[4843.08 --> 4843.64]  monumental
[4843.64 --> 4846.60]  good luck
[4846.60 --> 4846.86]  Intel
[4846.86 --> 4847.54]  it's gonna be
[4847.54 --> 4847.88]  rough
[4847.88 --> 4849.26]  yep
[4849.26 --> 4849.82]  Intel is
[4849.82 --> 4850.34]  currently working
[4850.34 --> 4850.94]  on a fix for
[4850.94 --> 4851.88]  the ETVB bug
[4851.88 --> 4852.26]  it says
[4852.26 --> 4852.92]  contributed to
[4852.92 --> 4853.40]  the instability
[4853.40 --> 4854.02]  but there's no
[4854.02 --> 4855.04]  indication that
[4855.04 --> 4855.72]  the company has a
[4855.72 --> 4856.30]  fix for the root
[4856.30 --> 4857.24]  problem says the
[4857.24 --> 4857.68]  last of our
[4857.68 --> 4857.94]  notes
[4857.94 --> 4859.72]  well
[4859.72 --> 4862.40]  cool
[4862.40 --> 4867.30]  I mean I guess
[4867.30 --> 4867.76]  yeah one
[4867.76 --> 4868.20]  option
[4868.20 --> 4870.38]  is they can
[4870.38 --> 4870.80]  just
[4870.80 --> 4872.40]  keep sending
[4872.40 --> 4872.96]  you more of
[4872.96 --> 4873.56]  them as long
[4873.56 --> 4874.02]  as you're under
[4874.02 --> 4874.40]  warranty
[4874.40 --> 4876.12]  and then hope
[4876.12 --> 4876.68]  that
[4876.68 --> 4879.18]  everyone's
[4879.18 --> 4879.52]  warranty
[4879.52 --> 4880.34]  expires at
[4880.34 --> 4880.84]  some point
[4880.84 --> 4881.94]  and
[4881.94 --> 4882.98]  that this
[4882.98 --> 4883.90]  doesn't leave
[4883.90 --> 4884.60]  too bad of a
[4884.60 --> 4885.04]  stain on their
[4885.04 --> 4885.38]  brand
[4885.38 --> 4886.52]  I think
[4886.52 --> 4886.86]  it's a pretty
[4886.86 --> 4887.50]  big stain on
[4887.50 --> 4887.82]  their brand
[4887.82 --> 4888.18]  I think
[4888.18 --> 4888.86]  that's probably
[4888.86 --> 4889.60]  more realistic
[4889.60 --> 4890.40]  and the stain
[4890.40 --> 4891.00]  on the brand
[4891.00 --> 4891.88]  to consumers
[4891.88 --> 4892.64]  is not the
[4892.64 --> 4893.02]  one that I'm
[4893.02 --> 4893.40]  worried about
[4893.40 --> 4893.98]  if I'm Intel
[4893.98 --> 4895.24]  like yeah
[4895.24 --> 4895.88]  sure
[4895.88 --> 4896.32]  whatever
[4896.32 --> 4897.72]  the amount
[4897.72 --> 4898.20]  of cares
[4898.20 --> 4898.90]  for consumer
[4898.90 --> 4899.38]  sales right
[4899.38 --> 4899.76]  now is
[4899.76 --> 4900.16]  never
[4900.16 --> 4900.76]  that and
[4900.76 --> 4901.30]  like gamers
[4901.30 --> 4902.18]  already mostly
[4902.18 --> 4902.72]  kind of hate
[4902.72 --> 4903.14]  them anyway
[4903.14 --> 4904.62]  so realistically
[4904.62 --> 4905.32]  what difference
[4905.32 --> 4905.82]  does it make
[4905.82 --> 4908.30]  it's the
[4908.30 --> 4908.90]  brand
[4908.90 --> 4909.72]  it's the
[4909.72 --> 4910.78]  reputational
[4910.78 --> 4911.38]  damage
[4911.38 --> 4911.84]  with the
[4911.84 --> 4912.12]  Dells
[4912.12 --> 4912.56]  and the
[4912.56 --> 4913.12]  HPs
[4913.12 --> 4913.56]  and the
[4913.56 --> 4914.84]  large
[4914.84 --> 4915.48]  institutions
[4915.48 --> 4916.58]  that I'm
[4916.58 --> 4917.10]  really worried
[4917.10 --> 4917.30]  about
[4917.30 --> 4917.70]  because a
[4917.70 --> 4918.12]  big part
[4918.12 --> 4918.54]  of why
[4918.54 --> 4919.02]  Intel
[4919.02 --> 4920.20]  has
[4920.20 --> 4921.18]  managed
[4921.18 --> 4921.86]  to maintain
[4921.86 --> 4922.40]  the kind
[4922.40 --> 4922.76]  of
[4922.76 --> 4923.40]  for example
[4923.40 --> 4924.18]  server market
[4924.18 --> 4924.58]  share that
[4924.58 --> 4925.04]  they have
[4925.04 --> 4925.98]  is because
[4925.98 --> 4926.88]  you never
[4926.88 --> 4927.44]  get fired
[4927.44 --> 4927.94]  for buying
[4927.94 --> 4928.34]  Intel
[4928.34 --> 4931.24]  not because
[4931.24 --> 4931.92]  their performance
[4931.92 --> 4932.78]  has necessarily
[4932.78 --> 4933.22]  been better
[4933.22 --> 4933.70]  there are
[4933.70 --> 4934.60]  other reasons
[4934.60 --> 4935.86]  Intel makes
[4935.86 --> 4936.38]  investments
[4936.38 --> 4936.84]  that AMD
[4936.84 --> 4937.50]  traditionally
[4937.50 --> 4937.92]  hasn't
[4937.92 --> 4938.30]  because they
[4938.30 --> 4938.60]  haven't had
[4938.60 --> 4939.10]  the resources
[4939.10 --> 4939.54]  for it
[4939.54 --> 4939.86]  in terms
[4939.86 --> 4940.56]  of deployments
[4940.56 --> 4941.00]  management
[4941.00 --> 4941.48]  and stuff
[4941.48 --> 4941.94]  like that
[4941.94 --> 4942.78]  but
[4942.78 --> 4945.50]  a big part
[4945.50 --> 4945.84]  of it is
[4945.84 --> 4946.38]  you don't
[4946.38 --> 4946.90]  get fired
[4946.90 --> 4947.38]  for buying
[4947.38 --> 4947.74]  Intel
[4947.74 --> 4949.24]  and now
[4949.24 --> 4949.86]  you might
[4949.86 --> 4952.96]  yeah
[4952.96 --> 4955.28]  in other
[4955.28 --> 4955.66]  news
[4955.66 --> 4956.80]  PS Portal
[4956.80 --> 4958.50]  still selling
[4958.50 --> 4959.46]  like gangbusters
[4959.46 --> 4960.38]  so can I
[4960.38 --> 4961.42]  have a Linus
[4961.42 --> 4961.82]  was right
[4961.82 --> 4962.16]  moment
[4962.16 --> 4962.62]  I think
[4962.62 --> 4963.20]  you get it
[4963.20 --> 4963.74]  yeah
[4963.74 --> 4964.52]  you get the
[4964.52 --> 4964.82]  point
[4964.82 --> 4965.40]  you get the
[4965.40 --> 4966.00]  token
[4966.00 --> 4966.68]  Linus was
[4966.68 --> 4967.02]  correct
[4967.02 --> 4967.50]  I don't know
[4967.50 --> 4967.90]  people are
[4967.90 --> 4968.44]  still mad at
[4968.44 --> 4968.76]  me about
[4968.76 --> 4968.94]  it
[4968.94 --> 4969.34]  I'm sure
[4969.34 --> 4969.68]  they are
[4969.68 --> 4970.48]  recent sales
[4970.48 --> 4971.46]  figures indicate
[4971.46 --> 4972.18]  that the
[4972.18 --> 4972.92]  PlayStation Portal
[4972.92 --> 4973.54]  is still going
[4973.54 --> 4974.16]  strong eight
[4974.16 --> 4974.80]  months post
[4974.80 --> 4975.22]  launch
[4975.22 --> 4976.14]  it has even
[4976.14 --> 4976.90]  beat Sony's
[4976.90 --> 4977.72]  own projections
[4977.72 --> 4978.28]  to the point
[4978.28 --> 4978.82]  that it's the
[4978.82 --> 4979.42]  best-selling
[4979.42 --> 4979.96]  video game
[4979.96 --> 4980.46]  accessory
[4980.46 --> 4981.56]  in dollar
[4981.56 --> 4982.34]  sales in
[4982.34 --> 4982.72]  the US
[4982.72 --> 4983.60]  for 2024
[4983.60 --> 4985.06]  so far
[4985.06 --> 4985.46]  I don't
[4985.46 --> 4986.06]  believe that
[4986.06 --> 4987.32]  yeah
[4987.32 --> 4987.96]  there's no
[4987.96 --> 4988.38]  way
[4988.38 --> 4989.10]  controllers
[4989.10 --> 4991.04]  yeah but
[4991.04 --> 4991.54]  it's 250
[4991.54 --> 4992.66]  controllers
[4992.66 --> 4994.26]  that's two
[4994.26 --> 4994.66]  and a half
[4994.66 --> 4995.26]  controllers
[4995.26 --> 4996.06]  okay tell
[4996.06 --> 4996.38]  me this
[4996.38 --> 4997.82]  how many
[4997.82 --> 4998.92]  controllers did
[4998.92 --> 4999.58]  your friends have
[4999.58 --> 4999.84]  for their
[4999.84 --> 5000.18]  consoles
[5000.18 --> 5003.98]  you're an
[5003.98 --> 5004.82]  adult right
[5004.82 --> 5005.14]  like
[5005.14 --> 5005.86]  I'm trying to
[5005.86 --> 5006.14]  yeah I'm
[5006.14 --> 5006.50]  trying to think
[5006.50 --> 5006.96]  a lot of
[5006.96 --> 5007.68]  console owners
[5007.68 --> 5008.20]  have one
[5008.20 --> 5008.90]  controller Luke
[5008.90 --> 5009.36]  yeah
[5009.36 --> 5010.60]  not anymore
[5010.60 --> 5011.22]  but you said
[5011.22 --> 5012.10]  I think you're
[5012.10 --> 5012.62]  referring to
[5012.62 --> 5013.54]  like before
[5013.54 --> 5014.26]  and there's so
[5014.26 --> 5015.00]  many options
[5015.00 --> 5015.60]  for controllers
[5015.60 --> 5016.04]  now
[5016.04 --> 5016.98]  not everybody
[5016.98 --> 5017.54]  buys a first
[5017.54 --> 5018.00]  party one
[5018.00 --> 5018.54]  views are
[5018.54 --> 5018.98]  different
[5018.98 --> 5019.24]  yeah
[5019.24 --> 5020.10]  okay
[5020.10 --> 5021.80]  sorry $200
[5021.80 --> 5022.64]  sorry $200
[5022.64 --> 5023.26]  that still
[5023.26 --> 5023.82]  seems kind of
[5023.82 --> 5023.98]  nuts
[5023.98 --> 5024.42]  I'm Canadian
[5024.42 --> 5024.88]  I don't know
[5024.88 --> 5025.10]  how much
[5025.10 --> 5025.44]  things cost
[5025.44 --> 5027.56]  what could
[5027.56 --> 5028.38]  one controller
[5028.38 --> 5029.20]  cost Luke
[5029.20 --> 5030.52]  $120
[5030.52 --> 5031.80]  doesn't it cost
[5031.80 --> 5032.28]  $79
[5032.28 --> 5032.84]  no no
[5032.84 --> 5033.26]  there's a
[5033.26 --> 5033.84]  banana reference
[5033.84 --> 5035.16]  this is a
[5035.16 --> 5036.42]  side tangent
[5036.42 --> 5037.26]  Arrested Development
[5037.26 --> 5037.52]  sorry
[5037.52 --> 5038.02]  I remember now
[5038.02 --> 5040.82]  how frustrating
[5040.82 --> 5041.66]  is it as a
[5041.66 --> 5042.00]  Canadian
[5042.00 --> 5043.42]  how much more
[5043.42 --> 5044.22]  difficult it has
[5044.22 --> 5045.00]  gotten to just
[5045.00 --> 5045.92]  navigate to the
[5045.92 --> 5046.66]  American version
[5046.66 --> 5047.50]  of a web page
[5047.50 --> 5048.82]  drives me
[5048.82 --> 5049.98]  flipping crazy
[5049.98 --> 5051.30]  oh you're in
[5051.30 --> 5051.66]  Canada
[5051.66 --> 5052.40]  you must want
[5052.40 --> 5052.94]  this thing
[5052.94 --> 5054.22]  no I am
[5054.22 --> 5055.02]  making a video
[5055.02 --> 5055.78]  and I want to
[5055.78 --> 5056.60]  know how many
[5056.60 --> 5057.60]  bloody freedom
[5057.60 --> 5058.98]  units people
[5058.98 --> 5060.42]  have to spend
[5060.42 --> 5060.98]  in order to
[5060.98 --> 5061.38]  get it
[5061.38 --> 5062.60]  oh I see you
[5062.60 --> 5063.60]  manually navigated
[5063.60 --> 5064.12]  back to the
[5064.12 --> 5064.64]  American site
[5064.64 --> 5065.40]  that must have
[5065.40 --> 5065.94]  been a mistake
[5065.94 --> 5066.70]  no problem
[5066.70 --> 5067.18]  here's the
[5067.18 --> 5067.70]  Canadian site
[5067.70 --> 5068.32]  for you again
[5068.32 --> 5070.22]  leave me alone
[5070.22 --> 5072.88]  yeah I've had
[5072.88 --> 5073.18]  that problem
[5073.18 --> 5073.64]  with best buy
[5073.64 --> 5073.92]  Krenn says
[5073.92 --> 5075.12]  another VPN
[5075.12 --> 5076.18]  plug opportunity
[5076.18 --> 5077.08]  LMAO
[5077.08 --> 5079.22]  not planned
[5079.22 --> 5080.00]  but there you
[5080.00 --> 5080.66]  go PIA
[5080.66 --> 5082.12]  Sony also
[5082.12 --> 5082.82]  appears to have
[5082.82 --> 5083.40]  worked out
[5083.40 --> 5084.44]  the supply chain
[5084.44 --> 5085.18]  issues that led
[5085.18 --> 5085.56]  to the portal
[5085.56 --> 5086.16]  recently running
[5086.16 --> 5086.68]  out of stock
[5086.68 --> 5087.48]  so that's good
[5087.48 --> 5088.34]  for them I guess
[5088.34 --> 5089.46]  in the past
[5089.46 --> 5090.22]  Sony has alluded
[5090.22 --> 5090.86]  to potentially
[5090.86 --> 5091.68]  adding cloud
[5091.68 --> 5092.54]  gaming functionality
[5092.54 --> 5093.42]  but there is
[5093.42 --> 5095.06]  currently no
[5095.06 --> 5095.92]  confirmation that
[5095.92 --> 5096.56]  that is the
[5096.56 --> 5096.98]  case
[5096.98 --> 5099.54]  so anyway
[5099.54 --> 5100.92]  let this be a
[5100.92 --> 5101.82]  lesson sometimes
[5101.82 --> 5102.44]  and I didn't
[5102.44 --> 5103.10]  buy a PS portal
[5103.10 --> 5104.14]  I don't even
[5104.14 --> 5104.58]  have a PlayStation
[5104.58 --> 5105.06]  5
[5105.06 --> 5107.06]  but sometimes
[5107.06 --> 5107.78]  when you review
[5107.78 --> 5108.48]  a product
[5108.48 --> 5110.06]  it's helpful
[5110.06 --> 5110.82]  to put yourself
[5110.82 --> 5111.56]  in the mindset
[5111.56 --> 5112.78]  of someone who
[5112.78 --> 5113.48]  might be considering
[5113.48 --> 5114.14]  it in the first
[5114.14 --> 5114.50]  place
[5114.50 --> 5115.78]  so when we gave
[5115.78 --> 5116.78]  a positive review
[5116.78 --> 5117.68]  to the PS portal
[5117.68 --> 5118.74]  while also
[5118.74 --> 5119.74]  acknowledging and
[5119.74 --> 5120.48]  complaining about
[5120.48 --> 5121.16]  some of the things
[5121.16 --> 5122.10]  that bothered us
[5122.10 --> 5122.50]  about it
[5122.50 --> 5123.10]  like how locked
[5123.10 --> 5123.76]  down it was
[5123.76 --> 5125.14]  it was in the
[5125.14 --> 5126.38]  context of someone
[5126.38 --> 5127.68]  who cares about
[5127.68 --> 5128.92]  the PS portal
[5128.92 --> 5129.80]  not the context
[5129.80 --> 5130.42]  of someone who
[5130.42 --> 5131.46]  wants another Vita
[5131.46 --> 5132.10]  because you aren't
[5132.10 --> 5132.96]  getting another Vita
[5132.96 --> 5134.12]  what you're getting
[5134.12 --> 5134.96]  is a portal
[5134.96 --> 5136.02]  and you can either
[5136.02 --> 5137.10]  like it or not
[5137.10 --> 5138.28]  I know like three
[5138.28 --> 5138.78]  people that have
[5138.78 --> 5139.30]  Playstations
[5139.30 --> 5140.66]  they all have
[5140.66 --> 5141.10]  portals
[5141.10 --> 5141.78]  and they all
[5141.78 --> 5142.22]  like them
[5142.22 --> 5144.16]  the good news
[5144.16 --> 5145.14]  is that even
[5145.14 --> 5146.00]  in spite of the
[5146.00 --> 5146.28]  haters
[5146.28 --> 5147.84]  we won the
[5147.84 --> 5148.54]  battle for PS
[5148.54 --> 5148.82]  portal
[5148.82 --> 5149.36]  we are the number
[5149.36 --> 5150.00]  one video for
[5150.00 --> 5150.64]  the PS portal
[5150.64 --> 5152.10]  I think there is
[5152.10 --> 5152.80]  one that has more
[5152.80 --> 5153.42]  views than us
[5153.42 --> 5153.64]  those are two
[5153.64 --> 5154.48]  really similar
[5154.48 --> 5154.96]  thumbnails
[5154.96 --> 5156.28]  these two right
[5156.28 --> 5156.50]  here
[5156.50 --> 5157.06]  oh yeah look at
[5157.06 --> 5157.28]  that
[5157.28 --> 5157.88]  wow
[5157.88 --> 5159.20]  oh that's both
[5159.20 --> 5159.54]  from the same
[5159.54 --> 5159.80]  person
[5159.80 --> 5160.60]  oh that would
[5160.60 --> 5161.06]  explain it
[5161.06 --> 5161.74]  that's very
[5161.74 --> 5162.14]  reasonable
[5162.14 --> 5162.80]  yeah there you
[5162.80 --> 5162.98]  go
[5162.98 --> 5163.80]  this is cute
[5163.80 --> 5165.42]  I actually
[5165.42 --> 5166.28]  don't necessarily
[5166.28 --> 5167.48]  like browse
[5167.48 --> 5168.12]  other people's
[5168.12 --> 5168.76]  thumbnails that
[5168.76 --> 5169.06]  often
[5169.06 --> 5169.80]  oh
[5169.80 --> 5170.86]  game ranks
[5170.86 --> 5171.26]  is great
[5171.26 --> 5171.80]  yeah there's
[5171.80 --> 5172.26]  not really a
[5172.26 --> 5172.72]  lot of
[5172.72 --> 5173.44]  there's not
[5173.44 --> 5173.94]  really a lot
[5173.94 --> 5174.64]  of buzz
[5174.64 --> 5174.88]  around
[5174.88 --> 5175.30]  ah yes
[5175.30 --> 5175.74]  yes this
[5175.74 --> 5175.96]  one
[5175.96 --> 5176.86]  this one
[5176.86 --> 5177.34]  was like a
[5177.34 --> 5178.12]  month earlier
[5178.12 --> 5178.60]  than us
[5178.60 --> 5179.16]  it's a really
[5179.16 --> 5179.78]  good video
[5179.78 --> 5180.96]  and it was
[5180.96 --> 5181.88]  it was that
[5181.88 --> 5182.92]  video actually
[5182.92 --> 5184.22]  that was part
[5184.22 --> 5185.00]  of our
[5185.00 --> 5185.98]  conversation about
[5185.98 --> 5186.70]  why we
[5186.70 --> 5187.62]  should not
[5187.62 --> 5188.64]  accept
[5188.64 --> 5189.26]  Sony's
[5189.26 --> 5189.86]  sponsorship
[5189.86 --> 5190.28]  for the
[5190.28 --> 5190.80]  PS portal
[5190.80 --> 5191.84]  so Sony
[5191.84 --> 5192.44]  this was
[5192.44 --> 5192.90]  for the
[5192.90 --> 5193.54]  first time
[5193.54 --> 5193.84]  ever
[5193.84 --> 5194.10]  I don't
[5194.10 --> 5194.46]  think they'd
[5194.46 --> 5195.04]  ever offered
[5195.04 --> 5195.46]  to sponsor
[5195.46 --> 5195.98]  us before
[5195.98 --> 5197.32]  but maybe
[5197.32 --> 5197.84]  they did
[5197.84 --> 5198.44]  their research
[5198.44 --> 5198.94]  and knew
[5198.94 --> 5199.68]  that I was
[5199.68 --> 5200.36]  an advocate
[5200.36 --> 5201.00]  for and I
[5201.00 --> 5201.20]  was an
[5201.20 --> 5201.82]  enthusiast
[5201.82 --> 5202.70]  about remote
[5202.70 --> 5203.36]  game streaming
[5203.36 --> 5204.60]  and they
[5204.60 --> 5205.14]  reached out
[5205.14 --> 5205.58]  to us
[5205.58 --> 5207.66]  and part
[5207.66 --> 5207.84]  of the
[5207.84 --> 5208.42]  conversation
[5208.42 --> 5209.68]  was a
[5209.68 --> 5210.04]  we think
[5210.04 --> 5210.40]  this could
[5210.40 --> 5210.84]  be a
[5210.84 --> 5211.02]  pretty
[5211.02 --> 5211.54]  controversial
[5211.54 --> 5212.30]  product
[5212.30 --> 5212.70]  among our
[5212.70 --> 5213.14]  audience
[5213.14 --> 5214.18]  and our
[5214.18 --> 5214.80]  take is
[5214.80 --> 5215.28]  going to be
[5215.28 --> 5216.10]  positive in a
[5216.10 --> 5216.86]  way that some
[5216.86 --> 5217.24]  of them might
[5217.24 --> 5217.92]  get mad about
[5217.92 --> 5218.70]  we certainly
[5218.70 --> 5219.18]  nailed that
[5219.18 --> 5219.40]  one
[5219.40 --> 5220.46]  and so if
[5220.46 --> 5221.42]  we take the
[5221.42 --> 5222.04]  money and say
[5222.04 --> 5222.50]  hey it's the
[5222.50 --> 5223.02]  same video we
[5223.02 --> 5223.38]  would have made
[5223.38 --> 5223.84]  anyway they
[5223.84 --> 5224.14]  might not
[5224.14 --> 5225.08]  believe us
[5225.08 --> 5227.50]  considering how
[5227.50 --> 5227.86]  many people
[5227.86 --> 5228.34]  thought the
[5228.34 --> 5228.72]  video was
[5228.72 --> 5229.26]  sponsored even
[5229.26 --> 5229.50]  though it
[5229.50 --> 5230.40]  wasn't I
[5230.40 --> 5230.74]  guess we
[5230.74 --> 5231.18]  kind of nailed
[5231.18 --> 5232.02]  that but
[5232.02 --> 5232.78]  another part of
[5232.78 --> 5233.86]  it was that
[5233.86 --> 5234.66]  we were getting
[5234.66 --> 5235.62]  it too late
[5235.62 --> 5236.94]  for like a
[5236.94 --> 5237.84]  sponsored overview
[5237.84 --> 5238.82]  to be of any
[5238.82 --> 5239.26]  value
[5239.26 --> 5240.74]  because of this
[5240.74 --> 5241.02]  video
[5241.02 --> 5242.80]  this video was
[5242.80 --> 5243.52]  so good that
[5243.52 --> 5243.90]  we were like
[5243.90 --> 5244.48]  okay in order
[5244.48 --> 5244.92]  for us to
[5244.92 --> 5245.38]  really add
[5245.38 --> 5245.94]  anything to the
[5245.94 --> 5246.52]  conversation
[5246.52 --> 5247.56]  we're gonna
[5247.56 --> 5248.22]  have to get
[5248.22 --> 5248.56]  you just got
[5248.56 --> 5249.00]  called out
[5249.00 --> 5249.74]  deeper into the
[5249.74 --> 5250.26]  nuts and bolts
[5250.26 --> 5250.74]  oh who'd I
[5250.74 --> 5251.24]  get called out
[5251.24 --> 5251.46]  by
[5251.46 --> 5251.98]  whiskey nerd
[5251.98 --> 5252.38]  88
[5252.38 --> 5253.34]  who's whiskey
[5253.34 --> 5253.86]  nerd 88
[5253.86 --> 5254.60]  they sponsored
[5254.60 --> 5255.30]  your setup in a
[5255.30 --> 5255.92]  storage container
[5255.92 --> 5258.80]  that's true
[5258.80 --> 5259.34]  got him
[5259.34 --> 5259.92]  I blocked
[5259.92 --> 5260.50]  that video
[5260.50 --> 5262.50]  and that
[5262.50 --> 5263.18]  was um
[5263.18 --> 5264.56]  okay so
[5264.56 --> 5265.66]  working with
[5265.66 --> 5266.30]  companies like
[5266.30 --> 5267.48]  sony can be
[5267.48 --> 5269.12]  very complicated
[5269.12 --> 5270.62]  so that
[5270.62 --> 5272.02]  was sony's
[5272.02 --> 5273.20]  uh home audio
[5273.20 --> 5274.20]  slash consumer
[5274.20 --> 5275.20]  electronics division
[5275.20 --> 5276.12]  which as far as
[5276.12 --> 5276.60]  I can tell
[5276.60 --> 5277.32]  operates like
[5277.32 --> 5278.12]  a completely
[5278.12 --> 5279.40]  different company
[5279.40 --> 5280.64]  we um
[5280.64 --> 5281.02]  you know
[5281.02 --> 5281.52]  you know how
[5281.52 --> 5282.38]  that video came
[5282.38 --> 5283.04]  out shortly
[5283.04 --> 5283.78]  before the launch
[5283.78 --> 5284.48]  of the playstation
[5284.48 --> 5284.90]  5
[5284.90 --> 5285.62]  oh man
[5285.62 --> 5285.94]  this is all
[5285.94 --> 5286.28]  this is all
[5286.28 --> 5286.62]  coming back
[5286.62 --> 5286.98]  to me now
[5286.98 --> 5288.18]  that video
[5288.18 --> 5288.92]  was shot
[5288.92 --> 5289.92]  before the
[5289.92 --> 5290.70]  ps5 came
[5290.70 --> 5290.92]  out
[5290.92 --> 5291.60]  but I believe
[5291.60 --> 5292.48]  it was released
[5292.48 --> 5293.78]  after the ps5
[5293.78 --> 5294.20]  came out
[5294.20 --> 5295.32]  and it has a
[5295.32 --> 5296.32]  ps4 in it
[5296.32 --> 5296.72]  oh
[5296.72 --> 5297.38]  and we tried
[5297.38 --> 5297.82]  to get them
[5297.82 --> 5298.66]  to delay it
[5298.66 --> 5299.54]  so that we
[5299.54 --> 5300.82]  could like
[5300.82 --> 5301.54]  but that division
[5301.54 --> 5302.20]  like didn't care
[5302.20 --> 5302.88]  didn't care
[5302.88 --> 5303.80]  and just wanted
[5303.80 --> 5304.66]  their thing out
[5304.66 --> 5306.08]  so yeah

[5308.72 --> 5309.82]  about sony
[5309.82 --> 5310.82]  was still true
[5310.82 --> 5311.50]  as long as
[5311.50 --> 5312.80]  we mean that
[5312.80 --> 5313.58]  part of sony

[5396.38 --> 5397.40]  zero
[5397.40 --> 5399.34]  one
[5399.34 --> 5400.34]  of a
[5400.34 --> 5400.62]  Sony
[5400.62 --> 5402.00]  is that
[5402.00 --> 5402.28]  is that

[5405.90 --> 5406.50]  yeah
[5406.50 --> 5407.88]  no
[5407.88 --> 5408.16]  we're

[5408.72 --> 5409.08]  we are
[5409.08 --> 5409.52]  point
[5409.52 --> 5410.22]  one
[5410.22 --> 5411.16]  of a
[5411.16 --> 5411.50]  Sony
[5411.50 --> 5412.70]  we have
[5412.70 --> 5412.96]  a hundred
[5412.96 --> 5413.28]  people
[5413.28 --> 5413.68]  don't we
[5413.68 --> 5413.78]  have
[5413.78 --> 5414.02]  slightly
[5414.02 --> 5414.22]  more
[5414.22 --> 5414.34]  than
[5414.34 --> 5414.56]  that
[5414.56 --> 5415.06]  slightly
[5415.06 --> 5415.26]  more

[5416.74 --> 5417.04]  thousand
[5417.04 --> 5417.36]  so I
[5417.36 --> 5417.48]  think

[5419.10 --> 5419.64]  in 2023
[5419.64 --> 5420.54]  so if
[5420.54 --> 5421.04]  they hired
[5421.04 --> 5421.44]  they might
[5421.44 --> 5421.78]  have more
[5421.78 --> 5422.06]  than that
[5422.06 --> 5422.28]  now
[5422.28 --> 5422.96]  yeah
[5422.96 --> 5423.86]  yeah
[5423.86 --> 5424.04]  we're
[5424.04 --> 5424.28]  one
[5424.28 --> 5425.10]  thousandth
[5425.10 --> 5425.84]  the size

[5515.48 --> 5516.22]  this so I'm
[5516.22 --> 5516.70]  gonna do the
[5516.70 --> 5517.52]  read and then
[5517.52 --> 5517.90]  you're gonna
[5517.90 --> 5518.36]  tell me what
[5518.36 --> 5518.74]  you think
[5518.74 --> 5519.00]  sure
[5519.00 --> 5519.90]  Google has
[5519.90 --> 5520.62]  updated its
[5520.62 --> 5521.06]  community
[5521.06 --> 5521.74]  guidelines
[5521.74 --> 5522.32]  regarding the
[5522.32 --> 5522.98]  depiction of
[5522.98 --> 5523.46]  firearms
[5523.46 --> 5524.52]  when this was
[5524.52 --> 5525.06]  announced earlier
[5525.06 --> 5525.58]  this month
[5525.58 --> 5526.12]  Google said
[5526.12 --> 5526.56]  that starting
[5526.56 --> 5527.68]  July 18th
[5527.68 --> 5528.18]  it would
[5528.18 --> 5528.78]  prohibit
[5528.78 --> 5529.16]  videos
[5529.16 --> 5529.84]  demonstrating
[5529.84 --> 5530.52]  how to
[5530.52 --> 5530.78]  remove
[5530.78 --> 5531.46]  safety devices
[5531.46 --> 5532.10]  from firearms
[5532.10 --> 5533.34]  and age
[5533.34 --> 5533.76]  restricting
[5533.76 --> 5534.40]  videos showing
[5534.40 --> 5535.30]  automatic weapons
[5535.30 --> 5536.18]  or homemade
[5536.18 --> 5536.98]  firearms
[5536.98 --> 5537.98]  however
[5537.98 --> 5538.92]  according to
[5538.92 --> 5539.68]  Greg Kinman
[5539.68 --> 5540.16]  who runs
[5540.16 --> 5540.66]  the popular
[5540.66 --> 5541.36]  gun enthusiast
[5541.36 --> 5541.78]  channel
[5541.78 --> 5542.68]  Hickcock
[5542.68 --> 5543.38]  45
[5543.38 --> 5544.60]  his YouTube
[5544.60 --> 5545.20]  rep says
[5545.20 --> 5545.62]  that a
[5545.62 --> 5546.62]  previous ban
[5546.62 --> 5547.26]  on content
[5547.26 --> 5548.22]  selling firearms
[5548.22 --> 5549.08]  has been
[5549.08 --> 5549.92]  expanded
[5549.92 --> 5551.10]  to any
[5551.10 --> 5551.66]  content
[5551.66 --> 5552.20]  sponsored
[5552.20 --> 5552.66]  by the
[5552.66 --> 5553.10]  firearms
[5553.10 --> 5553.88]  industry
[5553.88 --> 5554.78]  meaning
[5554.78 --> 5555.10]  that he
[5555.10 --> 5555.34]  has had
[5555.34 --> 5555.66]  to take
[5555.66 --> 5555.88]  down
[5555.88 --> 5556.66]  a large
[5556.66 --> 5557.00]  number
[5557.00 --> 5557.44]  of videos
[5557.44 --> 5557.78]  from his
[5557.78 --> 5558.02]  back
[5558.02 --> 5558.46]  catalog
[5558.46 --> 5559.00]  in order
[5559.00 --> 5559.48]  to avoid
[5559.48 --> 5560.04]  a channel
[5560.04 --> 5560.48]  strike
[5560.48 --> 5561.66]  many
[5561.66 --> 5562.30]  if not
[5562.30 --> 5562.80]  most
[5562.80 --> 5563.36]  popular
[5563.36 --> 5563.86]  gun
[5563.86 --> 5564.28]  content
[5564.28 --> 5564.70]  channels
[5564.70 --> 5565.54]  have some
[5565.54 --> 5565.94]  form of
[5565.94 --> 5566.46]  relationship
[5566.46 --> 5566.94]  with the
[5566.94 --> 5567.26]  firearms
[5567.26 --> 5567.74]  industry
[5567.74 --> 5568.52]  including
[5568.52 --> 5568.94]  companies
[5568.94 --> 5569.32]  providing
[5569.32 --> 5569.76]  ammo
[5569.76 --> 5570.46]  and sample
[5570.46 --> 5570.84]  firearms
[5570.84 --> 5571.44]  for testing
[5571.44 --> 5571.90]  as well
[5571.90 --> 5572.64]  as direct
[5572.64 --> 5573.80]  sponsorships
[5573.80 --> 5578.02]  ammo
[5578.02 --> 5578.28]  is really
[5578.28 --> 5578.68]  expensive
[5578.68 --> 5579.04]  that
[5579.04 --> 5579.46]  partnership
[5579.46 --> 5579.94]  is really
[5579.94 --> 5580.24]  common
[5580.24 --> 5580.50]  in this
[5580.50 --> 5580.88]  space
[5580.88 --> 5581.58]  also
[5581.58 --> 5582.20]  a lot
[5582.20 --> 5582.64]  of
[5582.64 --> 5583.50]  firearms
[5583.50 --> 5583.86]  YouTubers
[5583.86 --> 5584.76]  are almost
[5584.76 --> 5585.48]  exclusively
[5585.48 --> 5586.52]  sponsored
[5586.52 --> 5587.16]  by
[5587.16 --> 5587.82]  companies
[5587.82 --> 5588.50]  in the
[5588.50 --> 5588.82]  firearm
[5588.82 --> 5589.34]  industry
[5589.34 --> 5591.42]  especially
[5591.42 --> 5591.84]  there's
[5591.84 --> 5592.44]  one
[5592.44 --> 5593.18]  I don't
[5593.18 --> 5593.40]  remember
[5593.40 --> 5593.74]  the name
[5593.74 --> 5594.00]  of it
[5594.00 --> 5594.94]  it's
[5594.94 --> 5595.24]  like
[5595.24 --> 5595.56]  a
[5595.56 --> 5596.66]  gunsmithing
[5596.66 --> 5597.42]  company
[5597.42 --> 5597.80]  or a
[5597.80 --> 5598.28]  university
[5598.28 --> 5598.96]  or something
[5598.96 --> 5599.86]  Sonoran Desert
[5599.86 --> 5600.30]  Institute
[5600.30 --> 5600.68]  I believe
[5600.68 --> 5601.06]  it is
[5601.06 --> 5602.44]  they sponsor
[5602.44 --> 5602.80]  like a
[5602.80 --> 5603.00]  bunch
[5603.00 --> 5603.38]  of stuff
[5603.38 --> 5603.90]  I'm sure
[5603.90 --> 5604.58]  that is
[5604.58 --> 5605.00]  still
[5605.00 --> 5606.24]  included
[5606.24 --> 5608.22]  in
[5608.22 --> 5609.32]  this
[5609.32 --> 5610.16]  because
[5610.16 --> 5610.84]  I'm sure
[5610.84 --> 5611.72]  a gunsmithing
[5611.72 --> 5612.16]  university
[5612.16 --> 5613.10]  is considered
[5613.10 --> 5613.60]  as in the
[5613.60 --> 5613.88]  firearms
[5613.88 --> 5614.24]  industry
[5614.24 --> 5614.72]  yeah
[5614.72 --> 5616.22]  and if
[5616.22 --> 5616.48]  they're
[5616.48 --> 5618.84]  gating
[5618.84 --> 5619.34]  depictions
[5619.34 --> 5619.86]  of
[5619.86 --> 5620.28]  homemade
[5620.28 --> 5620.80]  firearms
[5620.80 --> 5621.32]  I'm certain
[5621.32 --> 5621.90]  any kind
[5621.90 --> 5622.24]  of
[5622.24 --> 5623.48]  smithing
[5623.48 --> 5623.94]  of anything
[5623.94 --> 5624.52]  it would
[5624.52 --> 5624.84]  just be
[5624.84 --> 5625.38]  a sponsor
[5625.38 --> 5625.66]  so they
[5625.66 --> 5625.80]  don't
[5625.80 --> 5626.04]  show
[5626.04 --> 5626.28]  I
[5626.28 --> 5626.60]  understand
[5626.60 --> 5626.94]  I just
[5626.94 --> 5627.20]  mean
[5627.20 --> 5627.58]  clearly
[5627.58 --> 5628.20]  they have
[5628.20 --> 5631.96]  manufacturing
[5631.96 --> 5632.72]  of firearms
[5632.72 --> 5633.14]  in there
[5633.14 --> 5635.12]  crosshairs
[5635.12 --> 5638.66]  I didn't
[5638.66 --> 5639.26]  I didn't
[5639.26 --> 5639.54]  see where
[5639.54 --> 5639.78]  that was
[5639.78 --> 5640.04]  going
[5640.04 --> 5640.54]  I knew
[5640.54 --> 5640.78]  you were
[5640.78 --> 5641.30]  on fire
[5641.30 --> 5641.70]  tonight
[5641.70 --> 5642.12]  pun of
[5642.12 --> 5642.46]  sorts
[5642.46 --> 5642.78]  but I
[5642.78 --> 5642.96]  didn't
[5642.96 --> 5643.42]  see
[5643.42 --> 5643.58]  no
[5643.58 --> 5644.06]  notes
[5644.06 --> 5645.20]  yeah
[5645.20 --> 5645.60]  this is
[5645.60 --> 5645.94]  going to
[5645.94 --> 5646.30]  be
[5646.30 --> 5647.00]  very
[5647.00 --> 5647.64]  tough
[5647.64 --> 5648.26]  YouTube
[5648.26 --> 5648.82]  has come
[5648.82 --> 5649.36]  for
[5649.36 --> 5649.88]  firearms
[5649.88 --> 5650.44]  creators
[5650.44 --> 5650.94]  on YouTube
[5650.94 --> 5651.78]  many times
[5651.78 --> 5653.14]  changing
[5653.14 --> 5653.58]  what type
[5653.58 --> 5653.98]  of content
[5653.98 --> 5654.26]  they can
[5654.26 --> 5654.44]  have
[5654.44 --> 5654.96]  changing
[5654.96 --> 5655.46]  the size
[5655.46 --> 5655.72]  of the
[5655.72 --> 5656.16]  magazines
[5656.16 --> 5656.88]  changing
[5656.88 --> 5657.60]  can you
[5657.60 --> 5657.86]  show
[5657.86 --> 5658.42]  full auto
[5658.42 --> 5658.92]  or not
[5658.92 --> 5659.60]  can you
[5659.60 --> 5659.94]  show
[5659.94 --> 5660.28]  bump
[5660.28 --> 5660.64]  firing
[5660.64 --> 5661.06]  or not
[5661.06 --> 5661.76]  all of
[5661.76 --> 5661.94]  these
[5661.94 --> 5662.18]  different
[5662.18 --> 5662.46]  rules
[5662.46 --> 5662.76]  over the
[5662.76 --> 5662.96]  years
[5662.96 --> 5663.14]  have
[5663.14 --> 5663.46]  expanded
[5663.46 --> 5663.80]  expanded
[5663.80 --> 5664.12]  expanded
[5664.12 --> 5664.30]  many
[5664.30 --> 5665.02]  many
[5665.02 --> 5665.20]  many
[5665.20 --> 5665.50]  times
[5665.50 --> 5666.22]  I don't
[5666.22 --> 5666.44]  think
[5666.44 --> 5666.68]  they've
[5666.68 --> 5666.84]  ever
[5666.84 --> 5667.20]  come
[5667.20 --> 5667.38]  for
[5667.38 --> 5667.54]  their
[5667.54 --> 5668.14]  monetization
[5668.14 --> 5668.52]  before
[5668.52 --> 5669.48]  I think
[5669.48 --> 5669.84]  this is
[5669.84 --> 5670.16]  the first
[5670.16 --> 5670.36]  time
[5670.36 --> 5670.66]  they've
[5670.66 --> 5670.84]  gone
[5670.84 --> 5670.98]  for
[5670.98 --> 5671.12]  their
[5671.12 --> 5671.74]  monetization
[5671.74 --> 5672.90]  what are
[5672.90 --> 5673.04]  they
[5673.04 --> 5673.28]  supposed
[5673.28 --> 5673.76]  to do
[5673.76 --> 5674.50]  it
[5674.50 --> 5674.76]  really
[5674.76 --> 5675.02]  feels
[5675.02 --> 5675.20]  like
[5675.20 --> 5675.42]  YouTube
[5675.42 --> 5675.86]  doesn't
[5675.86 --> 5676.12]  want
[5676.12 --> 5676.34]  them
[5676.34 --> 5677.36]  but
[5677.36 --> 5677.84]  where
[5677.84 --> 5677.96]  are
[5677.96 --> 5678.06]  they
[5678.06 --> 5678.32]  supposed
[5678.32 --> 5678.52]  to
[5678.52 --> 5678.74]  go
[5678.74 --> 5679.22]  it's
[5679.22 --> 5679.38]  not
[5679.38 --> 5680.14]  like
[5680.14 --> 5680.26]  there
[5680.26 --> 5680.62]  haven't
[5680.62 --> 5680.82]  been
[5680.82 --> 5681.30]  attempts
[5681.30 --> 5681.54]  to
[5681.54 --> 5681.90]  make
[5681.90 --> 5683.02]  firearms
[5683.02 --> 5683.42]  tube
[5683.42 --> 5685.42]  and
[5685.42 --> 5686.14]  it's
[5686.14 --> 5686.32]  not
[5686.32 --> 5686.56]  like
[5686.56 --> 5686.76]  this
[5686.76 --> 5686.90]  is
[5686.90 --> 5687.08]  the
[5687.08 --> 5687.34]  first
[5687.34 --> 5687.64]  time
[5687.64 --> 5687.78]  that
[5687.78 --> 5687.88]  a
[5687.88 --> 5688.22]  firearms
[5688.22 --> 5688.74]  creator
[5688.74 --> 5689.58]  has
[5689.58 --> 5690.02]  looked
[5690.02 --> 5690.14]  at
[5690.14 --> 5690.26]  the
[5690.26 --> 5690.78]  situation
[5690.78 --> 5691.18]  on
[5691.18 --> 5691.50]  YouTube
[5691.50 --> 5692.00]  especially
[5692.00 --> 5692.28]  with
[5692.28 --> 5692.62]  respect
[5692.62 --> 5692.90]  to
[5692.90 --> 5693.44]  monetizing
[5693.44 --> 5693.60]  their
[5693.60 --> 5693.96]  content
[5693.96 --> 5694.18]  and
[5694.18 --> 5694.40]  gone
[5694.40 --> 5695.10]  wow
[5695.10 --> 5695.52]  this
[5695.52 --> 5696.20]  is
[5696.20 --> 5697.26]  untenable
[5697.26 --> 5697.46]  I
[5697.46 --> 5697.68]  mean
[5697.68 --> 5698.30]  we
[5698.30 --> 5698.84]  have
[5698.84 --> 5699.34]  one
[5699.34 --> 5699.70]  actually
[5699.70 --> 5700.06]  really
[5700.06 --> 5700.72]  great
[5700.72 --> 5701.58]  firearms
[5701.58 --> 5702.02]  creator
[5702.02 --> 5702.26]  on
[5702.26 --> 5702.50]  slow
[5702.50 --> 5702.78]  plane
[5702.78 --> 5706.08]  but
[5706.08 --> 5706.26]  it
[5706.26 --> 5706.60]  seems
[5706.60 --> 5706.94]  like
[5706.94 --> 5707.18]  this
[5707.18 --> 5707.32]  is
[5707.32 --> 5707.50]  a
[5707.50 --> 5707.84]  major
[5707.84 --> 5708.80]  escalation
[5708.80 --> 5710.74]  oh
[5710.74 --> 5711.06]  who'd
[5711.06 --> 5711.12]  I
[5711.12 --> 5711.34]  forget
[5711.34 --> 5711.66]  about
[5711.66 --> 5711.96]  the
[5711.96 --> 5712.66]  TGC
[5712.66 --> 5713.00]  oh

[5715.00 --> 5715.20]  sorry
[5715.20 --> 5715.30]  it's
[5715.30 --> 5715.46]  okay
[5715.46 --> 5716.02]  the
[5716.02 --> 5716.16]  gun
[5716.16 --> 5716.44]  collective
[5716.44 --> 5716.68]  that's
[5716.68 --> 5716.86]  right
[5716.86 --> 5718.70]  but
[5718.70 --> 5718.94]  this
[5718.94 --> 5719.18]  seems
[5719.18 --> 5719.40]  this
[5719.40 --> 5719.60]  seems
[5719.60 --> 5719.76]  like
[5719.76 --> 5719.96]  a
[5719.96 --> 5720.30]  major
[5720.30 --> 5721.18]  escalation
[5721.18 --> 5721.78]  yeah
[5721.78 --> 5721.90]  and
[5721.90 --> 5722.08]  people
[5722.08 --> 5722.38]  are
[5722.38 --> 5722.96]  shouting
[5722.96 --> 5723.20]  float
[5723.20 --> 5723.34]  plane
[5723.34 --> 5723.90]  chat
[5723.90 --> 5724.24]  which
[5724.24 --> 5724.62]  like
[5724.62 --> 5724.82]  I
[5724.82 --> 5725.16]  appreciate
[5725.16 --> 5725.32]  it
[5725.32 --> 5725.42]  but
[5725.42 --> 5725.60]  we're
[5725.60 --> 5725.90]  not
[5725.90 --> 5726.66]  YouTube
[5726.66 --> 5726.86]  we're
[5726.86 --> 5727.00]  not
[5727.00 --> 5727.08]  a
[5727.08 --> 5727.28]  YouTube
[5727.28 --> 5727.64]  competitor
[5727.64 --> 5728.00]  it's
[5728.00 --> 5728.28]  not
[5728.28 --> 5728.48]  we
[5728.48 --> 5728.92]  never
[5728.92 --> 5729.28]  have
[5729.28 --> 5729.48]  been
[5729.48 --> 5729.68]  and
[5729.68 --> 5729.88]  it's
[5729.88 --> 5730.20]  it's
[5730.20 --> 5730.38]  not
[5736.08 --> 5736.36]  Patreon
[5736.36 --> 5736.82]  competitor
[5736.82 --> 5737.24]  but
[5737.24 --> 5737.62]  with
[5737.62 --> 5738.06]  actual
[5738.06 --> 5738.46]  like
[5738.46 --> 5739.40]  video
[5739.40 --> 5740.02]  Patreon
[5740.02 --> 5740.24]  has
[5740.24 --> 5740.52]  video
[5740.52 --> 5740.88]  I
[5740.88 --> 5740.98]  would
[5740.98 --> 5741.24]  like
[5741.24 --> 5741.38]  I
[5741.38 --> 5741.52]  would
[5741.52 --> 5741.70]  like
[5741.70 --> 5741.88]  this
[5741.88 --> 5742.26]  I
[5742.26 --> 5742.44]  think
[5742.44 --> 5742.58]  our
[5742.58 --> 5742.74]  video
[5742.74 --> 5742.86]  is
[5742.86 --> 5743.08]  better
[5743.08 --> 5743.32]  but
[5743.32 --> 5743.58]  Patreon
[5743.58 --> 5743.88]  does
[5743.88 --> 5744.04]  have
[5744.04 --> 5744.20]  video
[5744.20 --> 5744.40]  where
[5744.40 --> 5744.78]  I
[5744.78 --> 5745.10]  say
[5745.10 --> 5745.24]  that
[5745.24 --> 5745.34]  we're
[5745.34 --> 5745.66]  video
[5745.66 --> 5746.24]  focused
[5746.24 --> 5746.82]  sure
[5746.82 --> 5748.10]  that's
[5748.10 --> 5748.18]  a
[5748.18 --> 5748.38]  nice
[5748.38 --> 5748.54]  way
[5748.54 --> 5748.64]  of
[5748.64 --> 5748.82]  putting
[5748.82 --> 5749.06]  it
[5749.06 --> 5749.42]  yeah
[5749.42 --> 5750.44]  yeah
[5750.44 --> 5751.56]  but
[5751.56 --> 5751.72]  yeah
[5751.72 --> 5752.38]  there's
[5752.38 --> 5752.64]  been
[5752.64 --> 5753.46]  YouTube
[5753.46 --> 5753.70]  is a
[5753.70 --> 5754.04]  monopoly
[5754.04 --> 5754.60]  effectively
[5754.60 --> 5755.60]  nobody
[5755.60 --> 5755.84]  can
[5755.84 --> 5756.12]  really
[5756.12 --> 5756.44]  compete
[5756.44 --> 5756.62]  with
[5756.62 --> 5756.86]  them
[5756.86 --> 5757.18]  and
[5757.18 --> 5757.34]  if
[5757.34 --> 5757.48]  you
[5757.48 --> 5757.78]  make
[5757.78 --> 5758.30]  a
[5758.30 --> 5758.78]  people
[5758.78 --> 5758.92]  are
[5758.92 --> 5759.14]  saying
[5759.14 --> 5759.38]  that
[5759.38 --> 5759.58]  a
[5759.58 --> 5759.72]  bunch
[5759.72 --> 5759.84]  of
[5759.84 --> 5760.20]  creators
[5760.20 --> 5760.68]  just
[5760.68 --> 5761.06]  launched
[5761.06 --> 5761.36]  one
[5761.36 --> 5761.66]  called
[5761.66 --> 5762.24]  Pepperbox
[5762.24 --> 5762.70]  TV
[5762.70 --> 5763.90]  I
[5763.90 --> 5764.10]  wish
[5764.10 --> 5764.28]  them
[5764.28 --> 5764.42]  the
[5764.42 --> 5764.66]  best
[5764.66 --> 5764.80]  of
[5764.80 --> 5765.02]  luck
[5765.02 --> 5765.20]  I
[5765.20 --> 5765.34]  don't
[5765.34 --> 5765.54]  think
[5765.54 --> 5765.68]  it's
[5765.68 --> 5765.80]  going
[5765.80 --> 5765.88]  to
[5765.88 --> 5766.10]  work
[5766.10 --> 5766.40]  they're
[5766.40 --> 5766.50]  going
[5766.50 --> 5766.58]  to
[5766.58 --> 5766.96]  discover
[5766.96 --> 5767.24]  it's
[5767.24 --> 5767.54]  really
[5767.54 --> 5768.06]  hard
[5768.06 --> 5768.56]  yeah
[5768.56 --> 5768.86]  it's
[5768.86 --> 5769.28]  really
[5769.28 --> 5769.52]  hard
[5769.52 --> 5769.66]  it's
[5769.66 --> 5769.80]  really
[5769.80 --> 5770.14]  expensive
[5770.14 --> 5770.66]  and
[5770.66 --> 5771.06]  people
[5771.06 --> 5771.38]  come
[5771.38 --> 5771.56]  to
[5771.56 --> 5771.82]  YouTube
[5771.82 --> 5772.22]  for
[5772.22 --> 5772.38]  a
[5772.38 --> 5772.76]  variety
[5772.76 --> 5772.96]  of
[5772.96 --> 5773.20]  things
[5773.20 --> 5773.42]  not
[5773.42 --> 5773.66]  usually
[5773.66 --> 5773.90]  just
[5773.90 --> 5774.16]  one
[5774.16 --> 5774.44]  thing
[5774.44 --> 5775.52]  and
[5775.52 --> 5775.66]  that
[5775.66 --> 5775.90]  it's
[5775.90 --> 5776.04]  the
[5776.04 --> 5777.02]  discoverability
[5777.02 --> 5777.28]  of
[5777.28 --> 5777.54]  YouTube
[5777.54 --> 5778.12]  that
[5778.12 --> 5778.60]  allows
[5778.60 --> 5778.80]  it
[5778.80 --> 5778.94]  to
[5778.94 --> 5779.08]  hit
[5779.08 --> 5779.28]  that
[5779.28 --> 5779.68]  critical
[5779.68 --> 5780.12]  mass
[5780.12 --> 5780.32]  that
[5780.32 --> 5780.62]  makes
[5780.62 --> 5780.94]  ad
[5780.94 --> 5781.48]  supported
[5781.48 --> 5782.66]  tenable
[5782.66 --> 5783.22]  so
[5783.22 --> 5783.80]  apparently
[5783.80 --> 5785.12]  Hickok
[5785.12 --> 5785.58]  posted
[5785.58 --> 5785.82]  an
[5785.82 --> 5786.26]  update
[5786.26 --> 5787.32]  and
[5787.32 --> 5787.46]  it
[5787.46 --> 5787.90]  apparently
[5787.90 --> 5788.40]  only
[5788.40 --> 5788.86]  prevents
[5788.86 --> 5789.08]  from
[5789.08 --> 5789.44]  linking
[5789.44 --> 5789.72]  to
[5789.72 --> 5789.94]  their
[5789.94 --> 5790.38]  sites
[5790.38 --> 5790.82]  not
[5790.82 --> 5791.00]  the
[5791.00 --> 5791.34]  actual
[5791.34 --> 5792.16]  sponsorships
[5792.16 --> 5793.28]  which
[5793.28 --> 5793.80]  is
[5793.80 --> 5794.02]  going
[5794.02 --> 5794.22]  to
[5794.22 --> 5794.38]  hurt
[5794.38 --> 5794.64]  those
[5794.64 --> 5795.20]  sponsorships
[5795.20 --> 5795.60]  a lot
[5795.60 --> 5796.18]  yeah
[5796.18 --> 5796.48]  it'll
[5796.48 --> 5796.84]  hurt
[5796.84 --> 5797.66]  okay
[5797.66 --> 5798.38]  that's
[5798.38 --> 5798.88]  less
[5798.88 --> 5799.20]  bad
[5799.20 --> 5799.36]  than
[5799.36 --> 5799.50]  that
[5799.50 --> 5799.66]  is
[5799.66 --> 5800.18]  definitely
[5800.18 --> 5800.52]  less
[5800.52 --> 5800.74]  bad
[5800.74 --> 5800.86]  but
[5800.86 --> 5801.02]  that
[5801.02 --> 5801.22]  kills
[5801.22 --> 5801.38]  the
[5801.38 --> 5801.80]  tracking
[5801.80 --> 5802.16]  but
[5802.16 --> 5802.50]  like
[5802.50 --> 5802.94]  and
[5802.94 --> 5803.08]  the
[5803.08 --> 5803.24]  other
[5803.24 --> 5803.48]  thing
[5803.48 --> 5803.76]  too
[5803.76 --> 5804.10]  is
[5804.10 --> 5804.64]  I
[5804.64 --> 5804.80]  mean
[5804.80 --> 5804.96]  you
[5804.96 --> 5805.30]  remember
[5805.30 --> 5805.50]  how
[5805.50 --> 5805.70]  much
[5805.70 --> 5805.92]  we
[5805.92 --> 5806.24]  freaked
[5806.24 --> 5806.52]  out
[5806.52 --> 5806.86]  back
[5806.86 --> 5807.06]  when
[5807.06 --> 5807.38]  YouTube
[5807.38 --> 5808.12]  seemed
[5808.12 --> 5808.38]  like
[5808.38 --> 5808.56]  they
[5808.56 --> 5808.76]  were
[5808.76 --> 5810.44]  right
[5810.44 --> 5810.72]  before
[5810.72 --> 5810.90]  we
[5810.90 --> 5811.08]  moved
[5811.08 --> 5811.22]  to
[5811.22 --> 5811.40]  this
[5811.40 --> 5811.76]  office
[5811.76 --> 5812.66]  YouTube
[5812.66 --> 5813.10]  sent
[5813.10 --> 5813.28]  out
[5813.28 --> 5813.52]  that
[5813.52 --> 5813.94]  deck
[5813.94 --> 5815.02]  oh
[5815.02 --> 5816.58]  yeah
[5816.58 --> 5817.46]  where
[5817.46 --> 5817.80]  they
[5817.80 --> 5818.12]  were
[5818.12 --> 5820.30]  telegraphing
[5820.30 --> 5820.72]  a move
[5820.72 --> 5820.90]  where
[5820.90 --> 5821.04]  they
[5821.04 --> 5821.18]  were
[5821.18 --> 5821.30]  going
[5821.30 --> 5821.42]  to
[5821.42 --> 5821.70]  crack
[5821.70 --> 5822.18]  down
[5822.18 --> 5822.50]  on
[5822.50 --> 5822.78]  third
[5822.78 --> 5823.04]  party
[5823.04 --> 5823.68]  sponsorships
[5823.68 --> 5824.50]  this
[5824.50 --> 5824.76]  was
[5824.76 --> 5825.46]  really
[5825.46 --> 5827.14]  scary
[5827.14 --> 5827.46]  and
[5827.46 --> 5827.68]  so
[5827.68 --> 5827.96]  I
[5827.96 --> 5828.34]  can
[5828.34 --> 5829.24]  100%
[5829.24 --> 5829.58]  relate
[5829.58 --> 5829.74]  to
[5829.74 --> 5829.90]  what
[5829.90 --> 5830.20]  firearms
[5830.20 --> 5830.56]  creators
[5830.56 --> 5830.76]  are
[5830.76 --> 5831.06]  feeling
[5831.06 --> 5831.66]  even
[5831.66 --> 5832.12]  if
[5832.12 --> 5832.42]  they're
[5832.42 --> 5832.62]  still
[5832.62 --> 5832.86]  allowed
[5832.86 --> 5833.02]  to
[5833.02 --> 5833.34]  accept
[5833.34 --> 5833.90]  sponsorships
[5833.90 --> 5834.14]  because
[5834.14 --> 5834.42]  the
[5834.42 --> 5834.72]  rules
[5834.72 --> 5835.00]  back
[5835.00 --> 5835.34]  then
[5835.34 --> 5835.92]  were
[5835.92 --> 5836.16]  that
[5836.16 --> 5836.62]  basically
[5836.62 --> 5837.18]  it
[5837.18 --> 5837.40]  looked
[5837.40 --> 5837.60]  like
[5837.60 --> 5837.86]  someone
[5837.86 --> 5838.04]  at
[5838.04 --> 5838.28]  YouTube
[5838.28 --> 5838.52]  had
[5838.52 --> 5838.84]  decided
[5838.84 --> 5839.02]  they
[5839.02 --> 5839.22]  wanted
[5839.22 --> 5839.76]  a piece
[5840.72 --> 5840.84]  direct
[5840.84 --> 5841.42]  sponsorships
[5841.42 --> 5841.58]  that
[5841.58 --> 5841.70]  were
[5841.70 --> 5842.02]  happening
[5842.02 --> 5842.30]  to
[5842.30 --> 5842.70]  YouTubers
[5842.70 --> 5843.62]  so
[5843.62 --> 5844.38]  they
[5844.38 --> 5844.58]  put
[5844.58 --> 5844.96]  these
[5844.96 --> 5845.86]  draft
[5845.86 --> 5846.42]  this
[5846.42 --> 5846.88]  proposal
[5846.88 --> 5847.30]  draft
[5847.30 --> 5847.58]  rules
[5847.58 --> 5847.68]  I
[5847.68 --> 5847.76]  don't
[5847.76 --> 5847.86]  know
[5847.86 --> 5847.96]  what
[5847.96 --> 5848.08]  to
[5848.08 --> 5848.28]  call
[5848.28 --> 5848.40]  it
[5848.40 --> 5848.60]  but
[5848.60 --> 5849.02]  essentially
[5849.02 --> 5849.24]  I
[5849.24 --> 5849.40]  got
[5849.40 --> 5849.60]  this
[5849.60 --> 5850.00]  deck
[5850.00 --> 5850.52]  that
[5850.52 --> 5850.84]  laid
[5850.84 --> 5851.14]  out

[5863.46 --> 5863.86]  if
[5863.86 --> 5864.06]  we
[5864.06 --> 5864.28]  wanted
[5864.28 --> 5864.46]  to
[5864.46 --> 5864.70]  have
[5864.70 --> 5864.98]  those

[5867.48 --> 5867.96]  YouTube
[5867.96 --> 5868.96]  had
[5868.96 --> 5869.16]  to
[5869.16 --> 5869.50]  buy
[5869.50 --> 5869.88]  out
[5869.88 --> 5871.76]  the
[5871.76 --> 5872.22]  complete
[5872.22 --> 5872.80]  inventory
[5872.80 --> 5873.80]  of
[5873.80 --> 5874.02]  either
[5874.02 --> 5874.26]  that
[5874.26 --> 5874.66]  video
[5874.66 --> 5874.98]  or
[5874.98 --> 5875.16]  the

[5875.56 --> 5875.88]  during
[5875.88 --> 5876.10]  some
[5876.10 --> 5876.36]  period
[5876.36 --> 5876.50]  of
[5876.50 --> 5876.70]  time
[5876.70 --> 5876.88]  like
[5876.88 --> 5877.24]  essentially
[5877.24 --> 5877.48]  they
[5877.48 --> 5877.62]  were
[5877.62 --> 5878.08]  inserting
[5878.08 --> 5878.66]  themselves
[5878.66 --> 5879.60]  between
[5879.60 --> 5880.26]  creators
[5880.26 --> 5880.78]  and their
[5880.78 --> 5881.12]  direct
[5881.12 --> 5881.64]  sponsors
[5881.64 --> 5882.58]  the
[5882.58 --> 5882.80]  whole
[5882.80 --> 5883.06]  thing
[5883.06 --> 5883.52]  ultimately
[5883.52 --> 5883.80]  went
[5883.80 --> 5884.12]  nowhere
[5884.12 --> 5884.68]  but
[5884.68 --> 5884.80]  it
[5884.80 --> 5885.12]  was
[5885.12 --> 5885.56]  the
[5885.56 --> 5885.92]  tipping
[5885.92 --> 5886.54]  factor
[5886.54 --> 5886.84]  for
[5886.84 --> 5887.02]  me
[5887.02 --> 5887.22]  that
[5887.22 --> 5887.40]  made
[5887.40 --> 5887.54]  me
[5887.54 --> 5887.76]  sign
[5887.76 --> 5887.94]  with
[5887.94 --> 5888.28]  vessel
[5888.28 --> 5889.20]  so
[5889.20 --> 5889.36]  that
[5889.36 --> 5889.62]  was
[5889.62 --> 5889.82]  the
[5889.82 --> 5890.46]  precursor
[5890.46 --> 5890.86]  essentially
[5890.86 --> 5891.10]  to
[5891.10 --> 5891.36]  float
[5891.36 --> 5891.62]  plane
[5891.62 --> 5891.80]  that
[5891.80 --> 5892.02]  was
[5892.02 --> 5892.24]  run
[5892.24 --> 5892.66]  by
[5892.66 --> 5894.26]  Jason
[5894.26 --> 5895.50]  Kilroy
[5895.50 --> 5895.66]  or
[5895.66 --> 5895.84]  something
[5895.84 --> 5896.04]  like
[5896.04 --> 5896.16]  that
[5896.16 --> 5896.24]  I
[5896.24 --> 5896.40]  forget
[5896.40 --> 5896.54]  his

[5900.12 --> 5901.26]  Kilar
[5901.26 --> 5902.14]  Kilmar
[5902.14 --> 5903.90]  that
[5903.90 --> 5904.12]  guy
[5904.12 --> 5904.86]  yeah
[5904.86 --> 5906.06]  Kilar
[5906.06 --> 5906.56]  Jason
[5906.56 --> 5906.86]  Kilar
[5906.86 --> 5907.02]  I
[5907.02 --> 5907.20]  think
[5907.20 --> 5909.18]  anyway
[5909.18 --> 5909.48]  that
[5909.48 --> 5909.62]  was
[5909.62 --> 5910.06]  the
[5910.06 --> 5910.30]  tipping
[5910.30 --> 5910.56]  point
[5910.56 --> 5910.74]  for
[5910.74 --> 5910.86]  me
[5910.86 --> 5911.00]  that
[5911.00 --> 5911.14]  made
[5911.14 --> 5911.24]  me
[5911.24 --> 5911.38]  go
[5911.38 --> 5911.64]  holy
[5911.64 --> 5912.06]  crap
[5912.06 --> 5913.32]  no
[5913.32 --> 5913.80]  sponsor
[5913.80 --> 5914.12]  is
[5914.12 --> 5914.28]  going
[5914.28 --> 5914.38]  to
[5914.38 --> 5914.54]  want
[5914.54 --> 5914.70]  to
[5914.70 --> 5914.86]  pay
[5914.86 --> 5915.02]  for
[5915.02 --> 5915.16]  a
[5915.16 --> 5915.58]  sponsorship
[5915.58 --> 5915.82]  where
[5915.82 --> 5915.92]  I
[5915.92 --> 5916.12]  can't
[5916.12 --> 5916.24]  put
[5916.24 --> 5916.40]  their
[5916.40 --> 5916.70]  logo
[5916.70 --> 5916.88]  or
[5916.88 --> 5917.00]  a
[5917.00 --> 5917.22]  freaking
[5917.22 --> 5917.62]  link
[5917.62 --> 5918.78]  how
[5918.78 --> 5918.90]  am
[5918.90 --> 5918.96]  I
[5918.96 --> 5919.06]  going
[5919.06 --> 5919.16]  to
[5919.16 --> 5919.34]  deal
[5919.34 --> 5919.52]  with
[5919.52 --> 5919.86]  this
[5919.86 --> 5920.38]  how
[5920.38 --> 5920.48]  am
[5920.48 --> 5920.54]  I
[5920.54 --> 5920.64]  going
[5920.64 --> 5920.70]  to
[5920.70 --> 5921.08]  monetize
[5921.08 --> 5921.22]  my
[5921.22 --> 5921.42]  bloody
[5921.42 --> 5921.86]  content
[5921.86 --> 5922.46]  and
[5922.46 --> 5922.70]  that
[5922.70 --> 5922.88]  was
[5922.88 --> 5923.06]  what
[5927.48 --> 5928.24]  an
[5928.24 --> 5928.62]  upfront
[5928.62 --> 5929.08]  payout
[5929.08 --> 5929.36]  because
[5929.36 --> 5929.62]  they
[5929.62 --> 5929.84]  were
[5929.84 --> 5930.14]  trying
[5930.14 --> 5930.36]  to
[5930.36 --> 5930.94]  court
[5930.94 --> 5931.38]  creators
[5931.38 --> 5931.56]  and
[5931.56 --> 5931.68]  bring
[5931.68 --> 5931.80]  them
[5931.80 --> 5931.96]  onto
[5931.96 --> 5932.14]  their
[5932.14 --> 5932.58]  platform
[5932.58 --> 5932.76]  to
[5932.76 --> 5932.90]  do
[5932.90 --> 5933.20]  early
[5933.20 --> 5933.74]  access
[5933.74 --> 5934.82]  and
[5934.82 --> 5936.58]  that
[5936.58 --> 5937.46]  actually
[5937.46 --> 5937.86]  paid
[5937.86 --> 5938.14]  for
[5938.14 --> 5938.48]  a
[5938.48 --> 5938.96]  sizable
[5938.96 --> 5939.54]  portion
[5939.54 --> 5939.82]  of
[5939.82 --> 5940.16]  the
[5940.16 --> 5941.78]  renovation
[5941.78 --> 5942.28]  that we
[5942.28 --> 5942.44]  did
[5942.44 --> 5942.62]  here
[5942.62 --> 5942.96]  the tenant
[5942.96 --> 5943.32]  improvement
[5943.32 --> 5943.62]  that we
[5943.62 --> 5943.76]  did
[5943.76 --> 5944.04]  in this
[5944.04 --> 5944.36]  building
[5944.36 --> 5944.62]  so
[5944.62 --> 5944.82]  it's
[5944.82 --> 5945.34]  a bunch
[5945.34 --> 5945.46]  of
[5945.46 --> 5945.84]  ancient
[5945.84 --> 5946.30]  LMG
[5946.30 --> 5946.70]  history
[5946.70 --> 5947.04]  but
[5947.04 --> 5948.18]  yeah
[5948.18 --> 5948.72]  exactly
[5948.72 --> 5949.10]  but
[5949.10 --> 5949.40]  anyway
[5949.40 --> 5949.82]  the point
[5949.82 --> 5950.14]  is
[5950.14 --> 5950.34]  that
[5950.34 --> 5950.50]  I
[5950.50 --> 5952.06]  100%
[5952.06 --> 5953.18]  relate
[5953.18 --> 5953.54]  to
[5953.54 --> 5953.76]  what
[5953.76 --> 5953.96]  these
[5953.96 --> 5954.22]  folks
[5954.22 --> 5954.38]  are
[5954.38 --> 5954.64]  feeling
[5954.64 --> 5954.88]  right
[5954.88 --> 5955.18]  now
[5955.18 --> 5955.74]  and
[5955.74 --> 5957.22]  I
[5957.22 --> 5957.76]  wish
[5957.76 --> 5957.90]  I
[5957.90 --> 5958.04]  had
[5958.04 --> 5958.16]  a
[5958.16 --> 5958.44]  solution
[5958.44 --> 5958.76]  for
[5958.76 --> 5958.92]  you
[5958.92 --> 5959.18]  but
[5959.18 --> 5959.48]  I
[5959.48 --> 5960.36]  think
[5960.36 --> 5960.82]  that
[5960.82 --> 5962.24]  building
[5962.24 --> 5962.72]  a
[5962.72 --> 5963.10]  platform
[5963.10 --> 5963.32]  is
[5963.32 --> 5963.46]  going
[5963.46 --> 5963.50]  to
[5963.50 --> 5963.60]  be
[5963.60 --> 5963.86]  really
[5963.86 --> 5964.26]  challenging
[5964.26 --> 5964.66]  because
[5964.66 --> 5965.26]  what
[5965.26 --> 5965.60]  makes
[5965.60 --> 5965.86]  ad
[5965.86 --> 5966.20]  supported
[5966.20 --> 5966.60]  work
[5966.60 --> 5966.92]  is
[5966.92 --> 5967.82]  volume
[5967.82 --> 5968.98]  and
[5968.98 --> 5970.16]  we've
[5970.16 --> 5970.38]  seen
[5970.38 --> 5970.72]  attempts
[5970.72 --> 5971.02]  in the
[5971.02 --> 5971.34]  past
[5971.34 --> 5972.16]  good
[5972.16 --> 5972.92]  attempts
[5972.92 --> 5973.44]  from
[5973.44 --> 5973.90]  smart
[5973.90 --> 5974.34]  people
[5974.34 --> 5975.02]  that
[5975.02 --> 5975.42]  didn't
[5975.42 --> 5975.66]  work
[5975.66 --> 5975.86]  out
[5975.86 --> 5976.30]  because
[5976.30 --> 5976.66]  you
[5976.66 --> 5978.50]  can't
[5978.50 --> 5978.70]  build
[5978.70 --> 5978.92]  that
[5978.92 --> 5979.14]  kind
[5979.14 --> 5979.26]  of
[5979.26 --> 5979.60]  volume
[5979.60 --> 5979.86]  up
[5979.86 --> 5980.48]  and
[5980.48 --> 5980.78]  the
[5980.78 --> 5981.04]  other
[5981.04 --> 5981.36]  two
[5981.36 --> 5981.76]  major
[5981.76 --> 5982.16]  models
[5982.16 --> 5982.44]  right
[5982.44 --> 5982.74]  there's
[5982.74 --> 5982.86]  the
[5982.86 --> 5982.98]  all
[5982.98 --> 5983.12]  you
[5983.12 --> 5983.26]  can
[5983.26 --> 5983.38]  eat
[5983.38 --> 5983.70]  model
[5983.70 --> 5984.10]  like
[5984.10 --> 5984.46]  a
[5984.46 --> 5984.78]  Netflix
[5984.78 --> 5985.92]  where
[5985.92 --> 5986.22]  you
[5986.22 --> 5986.76]  pay
[5986.76 --> 5986.90]  a
[5986.90 --> 5987.16]  monthly
[5987.16 --> 5987.68]  subscription
[5987.68 --> 5987.90]  and
[5987.90 --> 5988.02]  then
[5988.02 --> 5988.20]  you
[5988.20 --> 5988.60]  watch
[5988.60 --> 5988.74]  what
[5988.74 --> 5988.84]  you
[5988.84 --> 5989.10]  want
[5989.10 --> 5991.80]  I've
[5991.80 --> 5992.28]  never
[5992.28 --> 5992.60]  seen
[5992.60 --> 5992.84]  that
[5992.84 --> 5993.12]  work
[5993.12 --> 5993.38]  either
[5993.38 --> 5993.96]  because
[5993.96 --> 5994.62]  on
[5994.62 --> 5994.86]  something
[5994.86 --> 5995.08]  like
[5995.08 --> 5995.20]  a
[5995.20 --> 5995.48]  Netflix
[5995.48 --> 5995.76]  it
[5995.76 --> 5996.06]  works
[5996.06 --> 5996.40]  because
[5996.40 --> 5996.72]  you've
[5996.72 --> 5997.12]  got
[5997.12 --> 5998.22]  hundreds
[5998.22 --> 5999.00]  of
[5999.00 --> 5999.42]  content
[5999.42 --> 5999.92]  pieces
[5999.92 --> 6000.54]  right
[6000.54 --> 6001.44]  that
[6001.44 --> 6002.40]  millions
[6002.40 --> 6003.08]  hundreds
[6003.08 --> 6004.04]  of millions
[6004.04 --> 6004.64]  of people
[6004.64 --> 6005.36]  are watching
[6005.36 --> 6005.72]  so you've
[6005.72 --> 6006.02]  got this
[6006.02 --> 6006.36]  extremely
[6006.36 --> 6006.80]  high
[6006.80 --> 6007.52]  concentration

[6158.20 --> 6158.78]  contributing
[6158.78 --> 6159.12]  those
[6159.12 --> 6160.10]  significant
[6160.10 --> 6160.86]  amounts
[6160.86 --> 6161.06]  of
[6161.06 --> 6161.36]  money
[6161.36 --> 6163.24]  it
[6163.24 --> 6164.68]  doesn't
[6164.68 --> 6165.92]  actually
[6165.92 --> 6166.24]  make
[6166.24 --> 6166.44]  that
[6166.44 --> 6166.74]  big
[6166.74 --> 6167.44]  of a
[6167.44 --> 6167.94]  difference
[6167.94 --> 6168.26]  right
[6168.26 --> 6168.50]  like
[6168.50 --> 6168.68]  if
[6168.68 --> 6169.40]  it's
[6169.40 --> 6169.74]  less
[6169.74 --> 6170.16]  than
[6170.16 --> 6170.94]  a
[6170.94 --> 6171.20]  few
[6171.20 --> 6171.88]  dollars
[6171.88 --> 6172.72]  times
[6172.72 --> 6173.74]  a hundred
[6173.74 --> 6174.30]  people
[6174.30 --> 6175.24]  think
[6175.24 --> 6175.70]  about
[6175.70 --> 6175.84]  it
[6175.84 --> 6176.10]  right
[6176.10 --> 6176.68]  like
[6176.68 --> 6176.86]  if
[6176.86 --> 6177.10]  you're
[6177.10 --> 6177.68]  paying
[6177.68 --> 6178.02]  five
[6178.02 --> 6178.34]  bucks
[6178.34 --> 6178.54]  and
[6178.54 --> 6178.66]  you're
[6178.66 --> 6178.90]  watching
[6178.90 --> 6179.18]  ten
[6179.18 --> 6179.48]  different
[6179.48 --> 6180.14]  creators
[6180.14 --> 6182.36]  each
[6182.36 --> 6182.48]  of
[6182.48 --> 6182.64]  them
[6182.64 --> 6182.90]  at
[6182.90 --> 6183.28]  most
[6183.28 --> 6183.52]  is
[6183.52 --> 6183.80]  getting
[6183.80 --> 6184.50]  50 cents
[6184.50 --> 6184.96]  a month
[6184.96 --> 6186.76]  but
[6186.76 --> 6186.98]  also
[6186.98 --> 6187.16]  the
[6187.16 --> 6187.52]  platform
[6187.52 --> 6188.24]  needs
[6188.24 --> 6188.72]  to be
[6188.72 --> 6189.24]  paid
[6189.24 --> 6189.56]  for
[6189.56 --> 6190.08]  so
[6190.08 --> 6190.46]  these
[6190.46 --> 6190.86]  numbers
[6190.86 --> 6191.26]  start
[6191.26 --> 6191.54]  to get
[6191.54 --> 6192.30]  vanishingly
[6192.30 --> 6192.80]  small
[6192.80 --> 6193.78]  the more
[6193.78 --> 6194.14]  people
[6194.14 --> 6194.38]  they're
[6194.38 --> 6194.56]  split
[6194.56 --> 6194.84]  across
[6194.84 --> 6195.02]  so
[6195.02 --> 6195.22]  that's
[6195.22 --> 6195.40]  why
[6195.40 --> 6195.60]  that
[6195.60 --> 6195.94]  Patreon
[6195.94 --> 6196.24]  model
[6196.24 --> 6196.52]  works
[6196.52 --> 6196.76]  that's
[6196.76 --> 6196.90]  why
[6196.90 --> 6197.10]  we
[6197.10 --> 6197.34]  can
[6197.34 --> 6197.80]  sustain
[6197.80 --> 6197.98]  the
[6197.98 --> 6198.26]  site
[6198.26 --> 6200.66]  so
[6200.66 --> 6200.84]  I
[6200.84 --> 6201.18]  really
[6201.18 --> 6201.52]  wish
[6201.52 --> 6201.68]  them
[6201.68 --> 6201.86]  luck
[6201.86 --> 6201.96]  and
[6201.96 --> 6202.08]  I
[6202.08 --> 6202.38]  want
[6202.38 --> 6202.54]  them
[6202.54 --> 6202.72]  to
[6202.72 --> 6203.10]  succeed
[6203.10 --> 6204.28]  like
[6204.28 --> 6205.76]  yeah
[6205.76 --> 6207.04]  go for
[6207.04 --> 6207.16]  it
[6207.16 --> 6207.28]  and
[6207.28 --> 6207.40]  the
[6207.40 --> 6207.56]  good
[6207.56 --> 6207.78]  news
[6207.78 --> 6207.94]  is
[6207.94 --> 6208.22]  building
[6208.22 --> 6208.44]  a
[6208.44 --> 6208.70]  video
[6208.70 --> 6209.24]  platform
[6209.24 --> 6209.80]  today
[6209.80 --> 6210.16]  is a
[6210.16 --> 6210.30]  lot
[6210.30 --> 6210.58]  easier
[6210.58 --> 6210.74]  than
[6210.74 --> 6210.84]  it
[6210.84 --> 6211.04]  was
[6211.04 --> 6211.50]  way
[6211.50 --> 6211.88]  easier
[6211.88 --> 6213.32]  and
[6213.32 --> 6213.56]  I
[6213.56 --> 6213.70]  mean
[6213.70 --> 6213.88]  we
[6213.88 --> 6214.20]  talked
[6214.20 --> 6214.42]  about
[6214.42 --> 6214.60]  this
[6214.60 --> 6214.84]  back
[6214.84 --> 6214.96]  in
[6214.96 --> 6215.04]  the
[6215.04 --> 6215.14]  day
[6215.14 --> 6215.28]  I
[6215.28 --> 6215.46]  don't
[6215.46 --> 6215.66]  remember
[6215.66 --> 6215.90]  how
[6215.90 --> 6216.10]  the
[6216.10 --> 6216.36]  math
[6216.36 --> 6216.64]  works
[6216.64 --> 6216.84]  out
[6216.84 --> 6216.96]  but
[6216.96 --> 6217.12]  it's
[6217.12 --> 6217.38]  like
[6217.38 --> 6218.76]  I
[6218.76 --> 6218.78]  I
[6218.78 --> 6218.96]  sure
[6218.96 --> 6219.16]  you've
[6219.16 --> 6219.26]  heard
[6219.26 --> 6219.38]  me
[6219.38 --> 6219.56]  say
[6219.56 --> 6219.74]  this
[6219.74 --> 6219.96]  quote
[6219.96 --> 6220.08]  I
[6220.08 --> 6220.22]  think
[6220.22 --> 6220.36]  it's
[6220.36 --> 6220.48]  like
[6220.48 --> 6220.74]  every
[6220.74 --> 6221.06]  three
[6221.06 --> 6221.52]  years
[6221.52 --> 6221.98]  things
[6221.98 --> 6222.12]  are
[6222.12 --> 6222.32]  three
[6222.32 --> 6222.62]  times
[6222.62 --> 6222.84]  easier
[6222.84 --> 6223.00]  to
[6223.00 --> 6223.24]  make
[6223.24 --> 6223.54]  when
[6223.54 --> 6223.64]  it
[6223.64 --> 6223.86]  comes
[6223.86 --> 6224.12]  to
[6224.12 --> 6224.90]  stuff
[6224.90 --> 6225.08]  on
[6225.08 --> 6225.20]  the
[6225.20 --> 6225.44]  internet
[6225.44 --> 6226.28]  I
[6226.28 --> 6226.44]  think
[6226.44 --> 6226.62]  this
[6226.62 --> 6226.72]  is
[6226.72 --> 6226.82]  a
[6226.82 --> 6227.16]  conversation
[6227.16 --> 6227.34]  we
[6227.34 --> 6227.52]  had
[6227.52 --> 6227.76]  back
[6227.76 --> 6227.86]  in
[6227.86 --> 6227.94]  the
[6227.94 --> 6228.14]  day
[6228.14 --> 6228.76]  about
[6228.76 --> 6228.94]  how
[6228.94 --> 6229.20]  like
[6229.20 --> 6229.54]  we're
[6229.54 --> 6229.76]  we're
[6229.76 --> 6230.00]  starting
[6230.00 --> 6230.26]  this
[6230.26 --> 6230.62]  now
[6230.62 --> 6231.80]  it's
[6231.80 --> 6232.08]  easier
[6232.08 --> 6232.24]  than
[6232.24 --> 6232.32]  it
[6232.32 --> 6232.44]  would
[6232.44 --> 6232.50]  have
[6232.50 --> 6232.64]  been
[6232.64 --> 6232.84]  three
[6232.84 --> 6233.08]  years
[6233.08 --> 6233.36]  ago
[6233.36 --> 6233.58]  but
[6233.58 --> 6233.88]  it's
[6233.88 --> 6234.54]  three
[6234.54 --> 6234.82]  times
[6234.82 --> 6235.10]  harder
[6235.10 --> 6235.28]  than
[6235.28 --> 6235.36]  it
[6235.36 --> 6235.48]  will
[6235.48 --> 6235.62]  be
[6235.62 --> 6235.76]  in
[6235.76 --> 6235.92]  three
[6247.38 --> 6248.76]  but
[6248.76 --> 6249.06]  that's
[6249.06 --> 6249.28]  okay
[6249.28 --> 6251.10]  so
[6251.10 --> 6251.56]  yeah
[6251.56 --> 6251.78]  I
[6251.78 --> 6251.86]  don't
[6251.86 --> 6252.00]  know
[6252.00 --> 6252.26]  it's
[6252.26 --> 6252.38]  way
[6252.38 --> 6252.60]  easier
[6252.60 --> 6252.82]  now
[6252.82 --> 6253.06]  it's
[6253.06 --> 6253.26]  also
[6253.26 --> 6253.70]  expensive
[6253.70 --> 6253.96]  and
[6253.96 --> 6254.14]  really
[6254.14 --> 6254.44]  annoying
[6254.44 --> 6254.86]  and
[6254.86 --> 6255.58]  takes
[6255.58 --> 6256.12]  expensive
[6256.12 --> 6256.58]  employees
[6256.58 --> 6256.88]  and
[6256.88 --> 6257.14]  stuff
[6257.14 --> 6257.28]  like
[6257.28 --> 6257.52]  that
[6257.52 --> 6257.84]  so
[6257.84 --> 6259.20]  it's
[6259.20 --> 6259.36]  a
[6259.36 --> 6259.66]  tough
[6259.66 --> 6260.32]  undertaking
[6260.32 --> 6260.86]  Bambi
[6260.86 --> 6260.98]  on
[6260.98 --> 6261.28]  Floatplane
[6261.28 --> 6261.56]  asks
[6261.56 --> 6261.92]  how long
[6261.92 --> 6262.06]  was
[6262.06 --> 6262.38]  Floatplane
[6262.38 --> 6262.64]  in the
[6262.64 --> 6262.82]  red
[6262.82 --> 6263.10]  for
[6263.10 --> 6263.86]  Floatplane
[6263.86 --> 6264.32]  was
[6264.32 --> 6264.78]  never
[6264.78 --> 6264.98]  in
[6264.98 --> 6265.08]  the
[6265.08 --> 6265.34]  red
[6265.34 --> 6265.58]  you
[6265.58 --> 6266.02]  guys
[6266.02 --> 6267.68]  incredibly
[6267.68 --> 6268.68]  contributed
[6268.68 --> 6269.60]  to us
[6269.60 --> 6270.10]  right
[6270.10 --> 6270.50]  from the
[6270.50 --> 6270.82]  outset
[6270.82 --> 6271.62]  when
[6271.62 --> 6272.06]  all we
[6272.06 --> 6272.38]  had
[6272.38 --> 6272.90]  was
[6272.90 --> 6273.96]  a
[6273.96 --> 6274.64]  rudimentary
[6274.64 --> 6275.00]  file
[6275.00 --> 6275.56]  download
[6275.56 --> 6276.08]  on

[6276.76 --> 6277.28]  forum
[6277.38 --> 6279.02]  I
[6279.02 --> 6279.38]  also
[6279.38 --> 6279.74]  want to
[6279.74 --> 6279.92]  make
[6279.92 --> 6280.12]  sure
[6280.12 --> 6280.32]  to
[6280.32 --> 6280.56]  shout
[6280.56 --> 6280.74]  out
[6280.74 --> 6280.90]  the
[6280.90 --> 6281.16]  early
[6281.16 --> 6281.50]  members
[6281.50 --> 6281.68]  of
[6281.68 --> 6281.84]  our
[6281.84 --> 6282.18]  team
[6282.18 --> 6283.90]  like
[6283.90 --> 6284.52]  Alexandre
[6284.52 --> 6284.80]  Jacques
[6284.80 --> 6285.34]  Saint-Jacques
[6285.34 --> 6286.56]  who
[6286.56 --> 6287.46]  were
[6287.46 --> 6288.74]  instrumental
[6288.74 --> 6289.64]  in
[6289.64 --> 6290.14]  keeping
[6290.14 --> 6290.34]  the
[6290.34 --> 6290.62]  platform
[6290.62 --> 6290.96]  up and
[6290.96 --> 6291.20]  running
[6291.20 --> 6291.52]  on a
[6291.52 --> 6292.00]  shoestring
[6292.00 --> 6292.38]  budget
[6292.38 --> 6293.60]  we pay
[6293.60 --> 6293.76]  him
[6293.76 --> 6294.12]  properly
[6294.12 --> 6294.52]  now
[6294.52 --> 6299.50]  it was
[6299.50 --> 6299.78]  really
[6299.78 --> 6300.18]  desperate
[6300.18 --> 6300.58]  times
[6300.58 --> 6300.84]  it was
[6300.84 --> 6301.14]  a really
[6301.14 --> 6301.48]  scary
[6301.48 --> 6301.90]  time
[6301.90 --> 6302.34]  vessel
[6302.34 --> 6302.70]  was a
[6302.70 --> 6303.12]  significant
[6303.12 --> 6303.58]  portion
[6303.58 --> 6303.88]  of our
[6303.88 --> 6304.12]  revenue
[6304.12 --> 6304.94]  payment
[6304.94 --> 6305.36]  if I
[6305.36 --> 6305.50]  remember
[6305.50 --> 6305.76]  correctly
[6305.76 --> 6306.12]  was a
[6306.12 --> 6306.50]  thank you
[6306.50 --> 6306.98]  monitor
[6306.98 --> 6307.50]  I think
[6307.50 --> 6307.70]  we
[6307.70 --> 6308.38]  shipped
[6308.38 --> 6308.54]  him
[6308.54 --> 6308.68]  a
[6308.68 --> 6309.06]  monitor
[6309.06 --> 6311.16]  he
[6311.16 --> 6311.36]  was
[6311.36 --> 6311.54]  a
[6311.54 --> 6312.22]  volunteer
[6312.22 --> 6314.68]  on
[6314.68 --> 6314.80]  the
[6314.80 --> 6315.14]  forum
[6315.14 --> 6315.38]  we
[6315.38 --> 6315.52]  were
[6315.52 --> 6315.66]  a
[6315.66 --> 6315.86]  much
[6315.86 --> 6316.22]  smaller
[6316.22 --> 6316.66]  company
[6316.66 --> 6317.02]  then
[6317.02 --> 6317.30]  I
[6317.30 --> 6317.44]  would
[6317.44 --> 6317.90]  like
[6317.90 --> 6319.72]  to
[6319.72 --> 6319.90]  make
[6319.90 --> 6320.04]  it
[6320.04 --> 6320.80]  extremely
[6320.80 --> 6321.40]  clear
[6321.40 --> 6322.08]  that

[6323.44 --> 6324.06]  principled
[6324.06 --> 6324.52]  stance
[6324.52 --> 6324.80]  these
[6324.80 --> 6325.16]  days
[6325.16 --> 6325.64]  on
[6325.64 --> 6326.62]  compensation
[6326.62 --> 6327.10]  speaking
[6327.10 --> 6327.62]  of which

[6334.64 --> 6334.84]  you
[6334.84 --> 6335.04]  I'm
[6335.04 --> 6335.22]  not
[6335.22 --> 6335.36]  going
[6335.36 --> 6335.48]  to
[6335.48 --> 6335.68]  pay

[6339.84 --> 6340.42]  Dan
[6340.42 --> 6341.40]  I have
[6341.40 --> 6341.96]  service
[6341.96 --> 6342.34]  levels
[6342.34 --> 6342.96]  Dan did
[6342.96 --> 6343.66]  some contract
[6343.66 --> 6344.76]  work for me
[6344.76 --> 6346.14]  to help me
[6346.14 --> 6346.82]  with my
[6346.82 --> 6347.66]  sister's memorial
[6347.66 --> 6349.26]  and I
[6349.26 --> 6349.92]  appreciated
[6349.92 --> 6351.02]  Dan helping
[6351.02 --> 6351.44]  with that
[6351.44 --> 6352.06]  because it
[6352.06 --> 6352.50]  was a lot
[6352.50 --> 6353.34]  easier for me
[6353.34 --> 6353.74]  to have
[6353.74 --> 6354.14]  I actually
[6354.14 --> 6354.58]  pulled in
[6354.58 --> 6354.98]  Brandon
[6354.98 --> 6356.14]  Lee
[6356.14 --> 6356.96]  it was a lot
[6356.96 --> 6357.72]  easier for me
[6357.72 --> 6358.28]  to have people
[6358.28 --> 6358.72]  that I was
[6358.72 --> 6359.64]  familiar with
[6359.64 --> 6360.34]  as the video
[6360.34 --> 6360.76]  crew
[6360.76 --> 6361.90]  that I
[6361.90 --> 6362.14]  was
[6362.14 --> 6363.22]  I mean
[6363.22 --> 6363.48]  I wasn't
[6363.48 --> 6363.88]  comfortable
[6363.88 --> 6364.42]  talking at
[6364.42 --> 6364.58]  all
[6364.58 --> 6364.88]  but that
[6364.88 --> 6365.18]  I would
[6365.18 --> 6365.38]  feel
[6365.38 --> 6365.62]  more
[6365.62 --> 6365.98]  comfortable
[6365.98 --> 6366.34]  with
[6366.34 --> 6366.84]  than
[6366.84 --> 6367.24]  having
[6367.24 --> 6367.78]  strangers
[6367.78 --> 6368.04]  there
[6368.04 --> 6368.26]  that I
[6368.26 --> 6368.50]  have to
[6368.50 --> 6368.84]  coordinate
[6368.84 --> 6369.10]  with
[6369.10 --> 6369.36]  anyway
[6369.36 --> 6370.60]  the point
[6370.60 --> 6370.94]  is
[6370.94 --> 6371.72]  that
[6371.72 --> 6372.34]  I told
[6372.34 --> 6372.58]  them
[6372.58 --> 6373.22]  explicitly
[6373.22 --> 6373.68]  because
[6373.68 --> 6374.24]  this is
[6374.24 --> 6374.64]  this is
[6374.64 --> 6374.96]  one of
[6374.96 --> 6375.10]  our
[6375.10 --> 6375.40]  core
[6375.40 --> 6375.98]  principles
[6375.98 --> 6376.66]  that
[6376.66 --> 6377.02]  people
[6377.02 --> 6377.38]  should
[6377.38 --> 6377.52]  be
[6377.52 --> 6377.72]  paid
[6377.72 --> 6377.90]  for
[6377.90 --> 6378.04]  their
[6378.04 --> 6378.48]  expertise
[6378.48 --> 6378.76]  and
[6378.76 --> 6378.88]  they
[6378.88 --> 6379.02]  should
[6379.02 --> 6379.14]  be
[6379.14 --> 6379.32]  paid
[6379.32 --> 6379.48]  for
[6379.48 --> 6379.62]  their
[6379.62 --> 6379.82]  work
[6379.82 --> 6379.94]  I
[6379.94 --> 6380.10]  told
[6380.10 --> 6380.46]  both
[6380.46 --> 6380.60]  of
[6380.60 --> 6380.78]  them
[6380.78 --> 6381.34]  I
[6381.34 --> 6381.58]  do
[6381.58 --> 6381.98]  not
[6381.98 --> 6382.26]  want
[6382.26 --> 6382.38]  to
[6382.38 --> 6382.78]  discount
[6382.78 --> 6383.44]  I'm
[6383.44 --> 6383.92]  asking
[6383.92 --> 6384.20]  you
[6384.20 --> 6384.64]  guys
[6384.64 --> 6385.40]  as
[6385.40 --> 6385.56]  a
[6385.56 --> 6385.84]  friend
[6390.76 --> 6391.70]  correctly
[6391.70 --> 6393.26]  okay
[6393.26 --> 6394.02]  and I
[6394.02 --> 6394.22]  told
[6394.22 --> 6394.38]  them
[6394.38 --> 6394.54]  to
[6394.54 --> 6394.90]  both
[6394.90 --> 6395.12]  to
[6395.12 --> 6395.30]  bill
[6395.30 --> 6395.48]  me
[6395.48 --> 6395.98]  properly
[6395.98 --> 6396.94]  one
[6396.94 --> 6397.12]  of
[6397.12 --> 6397.34]  them
[6397.34 --> 6397.80]  managed
[6397.80 --> 6398.02]  to
[6398.02 --> 6398.24]  follow
[6398.24 --> 6398.44]  my
[6398.44 --> 6398.74]  simple
[6398.74 --> 6399.28]  instructions
[6399.28 --> 6400.12]  at a
[6400.12 --> 6400.34]  time
[6400.34 --> 6400.58]  when I
[6400.58 --> 6400.76]  really
[6400.76 --> 6401.10]  don't
[6401.10 --> 6401.24]  want
[6401.24 --> 6401.30]  to
[6401.30 --> 6401.46]  be
[6401.46 --> 6401.74]  following
[6401.74 --> 6401.94]  up
[6401.94 --> 6402.06]  with
[6402.06 --> 6402.28]  people
[6402.28 --> 6402.48]  about
[6402.48 --> 6402.66]  this
[6402.66 --> 6402.82]  kind
[6402.82 --> 6402.94]  of
[6402.94 --> 6403.34]  bullshit
[6403.34 --> 6403.86]  and
[6403.86 --> 6404.06]  one
[6404.06 --> 6404.18]  of
[6404.18 --> 6404.32]  them
[6404.32 --> 6404.84]  didn't
[6404.84 --> 6406.08]  so
[6406.08 --> 6406.56]  this
[6406.56 --> 6406.72]  is
[6406.72 --> 6406.90]  why
[6406.90 --> 6407.16]  I'm
[6407.16 --> 6407.52]  upset
[6407.52 --> 6407.86]  and
[6407.86 --> 6408.08]  it's
[6408.08 --> 6408.22]  been
[6408.22 --> 6408.46]  sitting
[6408.46 --> 6408.60]  in
[6408.60 --> 6408.74]  my
[6408.74 --> 6409.06]  inbox
[6409.06 --> 6409.22]  for
[6409.22 --> 6409.28]  a
[6409.28 --> 6409.46]  while
[6409.46 --> 6409.60]  and
[6409.60 --> 6409.68]  I
[6409.68 --> 6409.84]  don't
[6409.84 --> 6410.06]  like
[6410.06 --> 6411.02]  particularly
[6411.02 --> 6411.34]  know
[6411.34 --> 6411.48]  how
[6411.48 --> 6411.62]  to
[6411.62 --> 6411.94]  discuss
[6411.94 --> 6412.08]  it
[6412.08 --> 6412.26]  with
[6412.26 --> 6412.44]  you
[6412.44 --> 6413.08]  because
[6413.08 --> 6413.26]  I
[6413.26 --> 6413.46]  guess
[6413.46 --> 6413.62]  we're
[6413.62 --> 6413.84]  doing
[6413.84 --> 6414.00]  it
[6414.00 --> 6414.34]  live
[6414.34 --> 6414.68]  yeah
[6414.68 --> 6415.08]  because
[6415.08 --> 6415.32]  I
[6415.32 --> 6415.54]  thought
[6415.54 --> 6415.72]  you
[6415.72 --> 6416.10]  trusted
[6416.10 --> 6416.58]  me
[6416.58 --> 6417.06]  to
[6417.06 --> 6417.78]  understand
[6417.78 --> 6418.04]  your
[6418.04 --> 6418.32]  wishes
[6418.32 --> 6418.90]  and bill
[6418.90 --> 6419.38]  accordingly
[6419.38 --> 6421.00]  I
[6421.00 --> 6421.44]  believe
[6421.44 --> 6421.82]  that you
[6421.82 --> 6422.10]  spent
[6422.10 --> 6422.50]  more than
[6422.50 --> 6422.88]  two and a
[6422.88 --> 6423.36]  half hours

[6427.54 --> 6427.88]  work

[6488.98 --> 6489.56]  no
[6489.56 --> 6490.34]  that's
[6490.34 --> 6490.52]  fine
[6490.52 --> 6490.98]  I'm
[6490.98 --> 6491.36]  misty
[6491.36 --> 6491.58]  no
[6491.58 --> 6491.76]  it's
[6491.76 --> 6491.96]  okay
[6491.96 --> 6494.50]  go back
[6494.50 --> 6494.76]  to merch
[6494.76 --> 6495.04]  messages
[6495.04 --> 6495.16]  what
[6495.16 --> 6495.38]  were we
[6495.38 --> 6495.70]  talking
[6495.70 --> 6495.98]  about
[6495.98 --> 6496.46]  we
[6496.46 --> 6496.88]  were
[6496.88 --> 6497.10]  talking
[6497.10 --> 6497.38]  about
[6497.38 --> 6497.72]  the
[6497.72 --> 6498.30]  forum
[6498.30 --> 6498.50]  and
[6498.50 --> 6498.82]  flowplane
[6498.82 --> 6498.96]  being
[6498.96 --> 6499.12]  hard
[6499.12 --> 6499.22]  to
[6499.22 --> 6499.34]  start
[6499.34 --> 6499.44]  up
[6499.44 --> 6499.62]  and stuff
[6499.62 --> 6499.78]  I
[6499.78 --> 6499.88]  have
[6499.88 --> 6499.90]  a
[6499.90 --> 6500.22]  story
[6500.22 --> 6500.48]  about
[6500.48 --> 6500.74]  AJ
[6500.74 --> 6501.08]  that I
[6501.08 --> 6501.58]  that I love
[6501.58 --> 6503.00]  when I hired
[6503.00 --> 6503.56]  AJ
[6503.56 --> 6504.42]  so that we
[6504.42 --> 6504.96]  could stop
[6504.96 --> 6505.36]  paying him
[6505.36 --> 6506.04]  in monitors
[6506.04 --> 6508.10]  I think you
[6508.10 --> 6508.60]  mean monitor
[6508.60 --> 6509.08]  I don't think
[6509.08 --> 6509.52]  we sent him
[6509.52 --> 6510.08]  more than one
[6510.08 --> 6510.30]  yeah
[6510.30 --> 6510.56]  I think
[6510.56 --> 6511.16]  we only sent him
[6511.16 --> 6511.36]  one
[6511.36 --> 6513.34]  when I
[6513.34 --> 6513.84]  hired AJ
[6513.84 --> 6514.48]  that was the
[6514.48 --> 6514.98]  first person
[6514.98 --> 6515.56]  that I had
[6515.56 --> 6515.90]  like
[6515.90 --> 6516.62]  completely
[6516.62 --> 6517.46]  solo hired
[6517.46 --> 6518.00]  hold on
[6518.00 --> 6518.40]  before you
[6518.40 --> 6518.66]  tell your
[6518.66 --> 6518.84]  story
[6518.84 --> 6519.06]  I just
[6519.06 --> 6519.28]  want to
[6519.28 --> 6519.46]  say
[6519.46 --> 6519.78]  it was
[6519.78 --> 6520.12]  a big
[6520.12 --> 6520.62]  sort of
[6520.62 --> 6521.28]  glow up
[6521.28 --> 6521.64]  moment
[6521.64 --> 6522.08]  for me
[6522.08 --> 6523.18]  when we
[6523.18 --> 6523.66]  could bid
[6523.66 --> 6524.16]  adieu
[6524.16 --> 6525.26]  to barter
[6525.26 --> 6525.70]  deals
[6525.70 --> 6526.50]  and like
[6526.50 --> 6527.48]  paying people
[6527.48 --> 6528.44]  in GPUs
[6528.44 --> 6529.86]  and monitors
[6529.86 --> 6530.90]  and you know
[6530.90 --> 6531.56]  whatever else
[6531.56 --> 6532.56]  like for me
[6532.56 --> 6533.04]  it's a point
[6533.04 --> 6533.56]  of pride
[6533.56 --> 6535.14]  that we can
[6535.14 --> 6535.80]  pay people
[6535.80 --> 6537.00]  money
[6537.00 --> 6537.80]  we worked
[6537.80 --> 6538.38]  hard to get
[6538.38 --> 6538.62]  there
[6538.62 --> 6539.42]  so that's
[6539.42 --> 6540.24]  that's why
[6540.24 --> 6540.72]  this means
[6540.72 --> 6541.16]  so much
[6541.16 --> 6541.48]  to me
[6541.48 --> 6541.80]  anyway
[6541.80 --> 6542.30]  carry on
[6542.30 --> 6542.74]  yeah
[6542.74 --> 6543.14]  I mean
[6543.14 --> 6543.56]  we didn't
[6543.56 --> 6544.10]  at the very
[6544.10 --> 6544.44]  beginning
[6544.44 --> 6544.72]  of the
[6544.72 --> 6545.00]  flowplane
[6545.00 --> 6545.28]  project
[6545.28 --> 6545.60]  we didn't
[6545.60 --> 6545.74]  know
[6545.74 --> 6545.92]  what we
[6545.92 --> 6546.10]  were going
[6546.10 --> 6546.34]  to do
[6546.34 --> 6546.66]  with it
[6546.66 --> 6547.00]  and then
[6547.00 --> 6547.24]  AJ
[6547.24 --> 6547.90]  really made
[6547.90 --> 6548.78]  it a thing
[6548.78 --> 6549.24]  that we could
[6549.24 --> 6549.82]  actually really
[6549.82 --> 6550.76]  do professionally
[6550.76 --> 6551.84]  and then that's
[6551.84 --> 6552.12]  when we were
[6552.12 --> 6552.78]  like oh okay
[6552.78 --> 6553.24]  well I guess
[6553.24 --> 6553.72]  we should like
[6553.72 --> 6554.28]  hire people
[6554.28 --> 6554.82]  because like
[6554.82 --> 6555.10]  we didn't
[6555.10 --> 6555.82]  know that we
[6555.82 --> 6556.02]  were going
[6556.02 --> 6556.32]  to make
[6556.32 --> 6556.70]  it a thing
[6556.70 --> 6557.06]  at first
[6557.06 --> 6557.38]  we had
[6557.38 --> 6557.84]  no idea
[6557.84 --> 6558.14]  it wasn't
[6558.14 --> 6558.54]  even called
[6558.54 --> 6558.88]  flowplane
[6558.88 --> 6559.18]  it was called
[6559.18 --> 6559.72]  rip vessel
[6559.72 --> 6560.38]  when AJ
[6560.38 --> 6560.66]  joined
[6560.66 --> 6561.72]  it was mostly
[6561.72 --> 6562.34]  a joke
[6562.34 --> 6563.12]  we were just
[6563.12 --> 6563.44]  trying to like
[6563.44 --> 6564.14]  do something
[6564.14 --> 6565.14]  well we needed
[6565.14 --> 6565.42]  we
[6565.42 --> 6567.02]  it wasn't that
[6567.02 --> 6567.54]  we were trying
[6567.54 --> 6567.98]  to do something
[6567.98 --> 6568.64]  it was we needed
[6568.64 --> 6569.42]  to do something
[6569.42 --> 6570.06]  to do something
[6570.06 --> 6570.40]  yeah
[6570.40 --> 6571.96]  so when I
[6571.96 --> 6572.64]  when I hired him
[6572.64 --> 6573.28]  because I had like
[6573.28 --> 6574.42]  been a part
[6574.42 --> 6575.46]  of hiring groups
[6575.46 --> 6577.24]  for hiring other people
[6577.24 --> 6577.94]  like there would be
[6577.94 --> 6578.74]  like two or three of us
[6578.74 --> 6579.10]  that would work
[6579.10 --> 6579.86]  on hiring a person
[6579.86 --> 6580.18]  or whatever
[6580.18 --> 6580.94]  I'd been a part of that
[6580.94 --> 6581.34]  but I'd never
[6581.34 --> 6582.08]  sold one before
[6582.08 --> 6582.40]  yeah
[6582.40 --> 6583.82]  so when I hired him
[6583.82 --> 6585.06]  I remember I realized
[6585.06 --> 6585.80]  like it was kind of weird
[6585.80 --> 6586.30]  that he'd never
[6586.30 --> 6587.64]  talked to Yvonne
[6587.64 --> 6590.72]  do you know this story now
[6590.72 --> 6591.62]  do you know what I'm talking about
[6591.62 --> 6593.40]  I have a vague familiarity
[6593.40 --> 6594.30]  with this
[6594.30 --> 6595.10]  so I
[6595.10 --> 6596.22]  so you're talking about
[6596.22 --> 6596.96]  his onboarding
[6596.96 --> 6597.72]  I called
[6597.72 --> 6598.06]  yeah
[6598.06 --> 6599.58]  I called AJ
[6599.58 --> 6600.72]  and was like
[6600.72 --> 6601.50]  I think we were talking
[6601.50 --> 6601.90]  about something
[6601.90 --> 6602.34]  then I was like
[6602.34 --> 6603.22]  hey you should talk
[6603.22 --> 6604.10]  to Yvonne by the way
[6604.10 --> 6604.54]  and he was like
[6604.54 --> 6604.84]  okay
[6604.84 --> 6606.24]  and then I just
[6606.24 --> 6606.98]  handed my phone
[6606.98 --> 6607.52]  to Yvonne
[6607.52 --> 6608.16]  and was like
[6608.16 --> 6609.24]  here this is AJ
[6609.24 --> 6610.00]  I just hired him
[6610.00 --> 6610.62]  and she was like
[6610.62 --> 6611.64]  hi
[6611.64 --> 6613.06]  probably one of the
[6613.06 --> 6613.64]  most awkward
[6613.64 --> 6614.78]  conversations I've
[6614.78 --> 6615.40]  overheard
[6615.40 --> 6616.60]  like ever
[6616.60 --> 6617.62]  neither of them
[6617.62 --> 6618.38]  knew what to say
[6618.38 --> 6619.22]  at all
[6619.22 --> 6621.02]  the hiring was
[6621.02 --> 6621.68]  already done
[6621.68 --> 6622.08]  there was no
[6622.08 --> 6622.70]  interviewing that
[6622.70 --> 6623.38]  needed to happen
[6623.38 --> 6623.78]  or anything
[6623.78 --> 6624.64]  she eventually
[6624.64 --> 6625.46]  had the phone back
[6625.46 --> 6626.06]  and I was just like
[6626.06 --> 6627.04]  well I'm sorry
[6627.04 --> 6628.92]  that was really awkward
[6628.92 --> 6632.22]  it was completely
[6632.22 --> 6632.96]  my fault
[6632.96 --> 6633.90]  it wasn't either
[6633.90 --> 6634.92]  their fault at all
[6634.92 --> 6636.32]  it wasn't because
[6636.32 --> 6636.84]  we were like
[6636.84 --> 6637.80]  trying to do
[6637.80 --> 6638.44]  a bad job
[6638.44 --> 6639.10]  yeah I just
[6639.10 --> 6640.04]  never done it before
[6640.04 --> 6640.68]  and I was like
[6640.68 --> 6641.48]  I mean it's
[6641.48 --> 6642.92]  at that point in time
[6642.92 --> 6644.28]  it would have been
[6644.28 --> 6645.28]  pretty weird to like
[6645.28 --> 6645.98]  join the company
[6645.98 --> 6646.84]  and not talk to Yvonne
[6646.84 --> 6647.58]  it turns out you're
[6647.58 --> 6648.70]  not born knowing
[6648.70 --> 6649.62]  how to do things
[6649.62 --> 6650.78]  and it's not because
[6650.78 --> 6652.10]  in bad faith
[6652.10 --> 6653.12]  we you know
[6653.12 --> 6653.90]  tried to screw
[6653.90 --> 6654.46]  things up
[6654.46 --> 6655.34]  it's because we just
[6655.34 --> 6656.44]  we're new at this
[6656.44 --> 6656.70]  right
[6656.70 --> 6657.12]  yeah
[6657.12 --> 6658.12]  because like
[6658.12 --> 6659.74]  it was always
[6659.74 --> 6660.54]  like we've talked
[6660.54 --> 6661.10]  about this a bunch
[6661.10 --> 6661.40]  of times
[6661.40 --> 6662.36]  Yvonne always did
[6662.36 --> 6662.88]  a huge amount
[6662.88 --> 6663.34]  at the company
[6663.34 --> 6664.06]  but she was very
[6664.06 --> 6664.68]  behind the scenes
[6664.68 --> 6665.18]  so a lot of people
[6665.18 --> 6665.58]  didn't know
[6665.58 --> 6666.20]  so like
[6666.20 --> 6667.72]  he was gonna need
[6667.72 --> 6668.52]  to interface with her
[6668.52 --> 6669.00]  a lot
[6669.00 --> 6669.48]  yeah
[6669.48 --> 6670.38]  so like I wanted
[6670.38 --> 6671.34]  them to touch base
[6671.34 --> 6672.16]  but then it was just
[6672.16 --> 6673.60]  it wasn't the right
[6673.60 --> 6674.18]  time and it was
[6674.18 --> 6674.96]  the worst possible
[6674.96 --> 6675.28]  intro
[6675.28 --> 6677.00]  anyways
[6677.00 --> 6678.54]  yeah
[6678.54 --> 6680.44]  what do we got left
[6680.44 --> 6681.16]  I think we're supposed
[6681.16 --> 6681.88]  to do sponsors
[6681.88 --> 6682.70]  real quick here
[6682.70 --> 6683.06]  okay
[6683.06 --> 6684.00]  why don't we jump
[6684.00 --> 6684.50]  into that
[6684.50 --> 6685.16]  the show is brought
[6685.16 --> 6685.62]  to you today
[6685.62 --> 6686.52]  by Vessi
[6686.52 --> 6687.42]  you might have
[6687.42 --> 6688.42]  wasted lots of
[6688.42 --> 6689.16]  money on useless
[6689.16 --> 6690.12]  stuff like
[6690.12 --> 6690.74]  Sherrod
[6690.74 --> 6693.36]  did you watch
[6693.36 --> 6694.28]  his AMD upgrade
[6694.28 --> 6694.50]  I did
[6694.50 --> 6694.90]  yeah
[6694.90 --> 6695.80]  oh my god
[6695.80 --> 6697.12]  or you could
[6697.12 --> 6697.56]  buy something
[6697.56 --> 6698.34]  practical from
[6698.34 --> 6698.84]  our sponsor
[6698.84 --> 6699.26]  Vessi

[6700.50 --> 6701.16]  that Vessi's
[6701.16 --> 6702.02]  shoes are more
[6702.02 --> 6702.92]  stylish than

[6703.62 --> 6704.36]  plus
[6704.36 --> 6706.12]  Vessi advertises
[6706.12 --> 6706.68]  that they are
[6706.68 --> 6707.92]  very waterproof

[6872.48 --> 6872.94]  that's fair
[6872.94 --> 6873.46]  who else is
[6873.46 --> 6875.02]  gonna throw
[6875.02 --> 6875.68]  your party
[6875.68 --> 6876.12]  if you don't
[6876.12 --> 6876.46]  do it for
[6876.46 --> 6876.80]  yourself
[6876.80 --> 6877.42]  but I don't
[6877.42 --> 6877.94]  know I always
[6877.94 --> 6878.80]  just like
[6878.80 --> 6880.36]  I don't know
[6880.36 --> 6880.86]  I just stopped
[6880.86 --> 6881.42]  I don't like
[6881.42 --> 6882.24]  gifts giving

[6883.10 --> 6883.48]  don't throw a
[6883.48 --> 6883.96]  birthday party
[6883.96 --> 6884.34]  no one will
[6884.34 --> 6885.00]  give me a gift
[6885.00 --> 6885.94]  and then I
[6885.94 --> 6886.28]  won't have to
[6886.28 --> 6886.80]  give them one
[6886.80 --> 6887.72]  I also don't
[6887.72 --> 6888.26]  get invited to

[6888.78 --> 6889.34]  parties though
[6889.34 --> 6889.82]  so I guess
[6889.82 --> 6891.22]  that's my
[6891.22 --> 6891.94]  social isolation
[6891.94 --> 6893.02]  strategy right
[6893.02 --> 6893.30]  there

[7010.82 --> 7011.24]  life
[7011.24 --> 7012.56]  that's a cop out
[7012.56 --> 7013.60]  excuse you suck
[7013.60 --> 7014.34]  why do you hate
[7014.34 --> 7014.94]  float planes
[7014.94 --> 7015.46]  it's not
[7015.46 --> 7016.20]  is it because they
[7016.20 --> 7017.58]  all use Firefox
[7017.58 --> 7019.24]  I use Firefox now
[7019.24 --> 7020.66]  were you there for
[7020.66 --> 7021.16]  that conversation
[7021.16 --> 7021.96]  yeah probably
[7021.96 --> 7022.72]  yeah all right
[7022.72 --> 7023.30]  moving on
[7023.30 --> 7024.20]  I use Firefox for
[7024.20 --> 7024.80]  okay I got another
[7024.80 --> 7025.24]  one for Luke
[7025.24 --> 7026.22]  okay fine
[7026.22 --> 7027.52]  uh how much do
[7027.52 --> 7028.62]  birds factor into
[7028.62 --> 7029.30]  your diet
[7029.30 --> 7030.58]  our cockatoo likes
[7030.58 --> 7032.06]  eating everything I
[7032.06 --> 7032.82]  eat and I find
[7032.82 --> 7033.82]  myself eating more
[7033.82 --> 7034.54]  fruit and veggies
[7034.54 --> 7035.68]  because of it so I
[7035.68 --> 7036.30]  can share
[7036.30 --> 7037.66]  I joke she's my
[7037.66 --> 7038.58]  diet bird
[7038.58 --> 7039.54]  that's good
[7039.54 --> 7040.48]  that's adorable
[7040.48 --> 7041.70]  and also cute
[7041.70 --> 7043.28]  not at all because
[7043.28 --> 7044.10]  my birds don't eat
[7044.10 --> 7045.22]  anything that I
[7045.22 --> 7046.84]  eat um I think
[7046.84 --> 7049.04]  budgies are more
[7049.04 --> 7050.86]  skittish than
[7050.86 --> 7052.44]  did you say
[7052.44 --> 7052.90]  cockatoo
[7052.90 --> 7054.98]  I think so yeah
[7054.98 --> 7056.16]  are more skittish
[7056.16 --> 7056.50]  than that
[7056.50 --> 7057.46]  they're sold out
[7057.46 --> 7057.78]  already
[7057.78 --> 7058.60]  wow I mean
[7058.60 --> 7060.04]  $11 sweatpants
[7060.04 --> 7060.80]  yeah that's not
[7060.80 --> 7061.20]  surprising
[7061.20 --> 7063.50]  um yeah but they
[7063.50 --> 7063.98]  don't they don't eat
[7063.98 --> 7064.88]  anything that I
[7064.88 --> 7065.98]  I will say however
[7065.98 --> 7067.06]  that they they
[7067.06 --> 7068.36]  our kitchen is like
[7068.36 --> 7069.70]  right by where our
[7069.70 --> 7070.96]  our birds are so
[7070.96 --> 7072.78]  we can't cook well
[7072.78 --> 7073.66]  we could we don't
[7073.66 --> 7074.36]  really want to cook
[7074.36 --> 7075.38]  while they're out
[7075.38 --> 7076.94]  um or not covered up
[7076.94 --> 7077.48]  at the very least
[7077.48 --> 7078.66]  because of if we're
[7078.66 --> 7079.66]  cooking stovetop or
[7079.66 --> 7081.08]  something fume smoke
[7081.08 --> 7083.86]  whatever um so I
[7083.86 --> 7084.78]  there's more meal
[7084.78 --> 7085.92]  prep going on than
[7085.92 --> 7086.60]  there has been in the
[7086.60 --> 7088.08]  past I guess that has
[7088.08 --> 7088.88]  affected the diet a
[7088.88 --> 7090.28]  little bit yeah
[7090.28 --> 7093.14]  okay I know I see
[7093.14 --> 7093.80]  what I just got I
[7093.80 --> 7094.44]  didn't do it for a
[7094.44 --> 7095.08]  little kaisy
[7095.08 --> 7100.26]  um he ldl I'm a
[7100.26 --> 7101.76]  digikey software
[7101.76 --> 7103.34]  engineer nice who
[7103.34 --> 7104.28]  was inspired to get
[7104.28 --> 7105.12]  into computer science
[7105.12 --> 7105.66]  because of your
[7105.66 --> 7107.02]  videos awesome if
[7107.02 --> 7107.94]  luke couldn't have
[7107.94 --> 7109.28]  birds what would he
[7109.28 --> 7109.96]  have instead
[7109.96 --> 7113.00]  uh my my house
[7113.00 --> 7116.06]  um grew up as a
[7116.06 --> 7116.56]  dog
[7116.56 --> 7124.98]  my mom was a dog
[7124.98 --> 7126.52]  groomer and she ran
[7126.52 --> 7127.38]  the dog grooming shop
[7127.38 --> 7128.20]  out of our garage
[7128.20 --> 7129.52]  um so there was
[7129.52 --> 7130.42]  dogs around all the
[7130.42 --> 7131.70]  time and we had
[7131.70 --> 7132.78]  dogs of our own
[7132.78 --> 7134.02]  and my mom would
[7134.02 --> 7135.52]  would train our dogs
[7135.52 --> 7136.76]  really really well and
[7136.76 --> 7137.22]  then bring them to
[7137.22 --> 7138.04]  dog shows and all
[7138.04 --> 7138.36]  this other kind of
[7138.36 --> 7138.96]  stuff we had a great
[7138.96 --> 7139.72]  day in growing up so
[7139.72 --> 7140.40]  dogs have always been a
[7140.40 --> 7141.02]  big part of my life
[7141.02 --> 7142.38]  dog and I want a dog
[7142.38 --> 7144.66]  but after dog sitting
[7144.66 --> 7146.54]  someone else's dog I
[7146.54 --> 7147.96]  have no desire to have
[7147.96 --> 7149.02]  a dog in an apartment
[7149.02 --> 7152.02]  I want a yard it's very
[7152.02 --> 7154.82]  difficult to afford so I
[7154.82 --> 7157.50]  don't know um but one
[7157.50 --> 7158.50]  day I'll get a dog but
[7158.50 --> 7159.38]  only when I have a yard I
[7159.38 --> 7160.28]  will not get a dog before
[7160.28 --> 7161.34]  I have a yard dogs in
[7161.34 --> 7162.08]  apartments don't make
[7162.08 --> 7162.84]  sense to me personally
[7162.84 --> 7164.12]  it's the work for me
[7164.12 --> 7166.36]  yeah I mean it's way more
[7166.36 --> 7167.14]  work if you're in an
[7167.14 --> 7168.16]  apartment and imagine
[7168.16 --> 7169.24]  like imagine you have
[7169.24 --> 7171.76]  a little puppy and
[7171.76 --> 7172.78]  you're trying to potty
[7172.78 --> 7173.66]  train the little puppy
[7173.66 --> 7174.64]  oh it needs to go to
[7174.64 --> 7175.52]  the washroom I'm gonna
[7175.52 --> 7178.46]  put it outside in a few
[7178.46 --> 7179.94]  minutes I guess because I
[7179.94 --> 7180.64]  have to get out of my
[7180.64 --> 7181.86]  apartment building like
[7181.86 --> 7183.62]  what the heck I don't
[7183.62 --> 7184.86]  know yeah it's pretty
[7184.86 --> 7185.68]  challenging I mean there
[7185.68 --> 7186.56]  there are definitely
[7186.56 --> 7188.66]  solutions um also
[7188.66 --> 7190.42]  properly exercising the
[7190.42 --> 7192.02]  size and breed of dog
[7192.02 --> 7192.94]  that I would probably end
[7192.94 --> 7194.46]  up wanting in an
[7194.46 --> 7195.72]  apartment yeah you got
[7195.72 --> 7196.54]  to remember he's gonna be
[7196.54 --> 7197.70]  a big dog guy yeah
[7197.70 --> 7201.14]  um so I'm I will I
[7201.14 --> 7202.20]  will not have a life
[7202.20 --> 7203.26]  ever because I'll have
[7203.26 --> 7204.14]  to be walking the dog
[7204.14 --> 7205.68]  100% of the time if
[7205.68 --> 7206.66]  when I'm away at work
[7206.66 --> 7207.28]  and stuff it's just
[7207.28 --> 7209.44]  stuck like okay I
[7209.44 --> 7210.62]  don't know so yeah I
[7210.62 --> 7212.20]  will not get a dog until
[7212.20 --> 7213.50]  I have somewhere that it
[7213.50 --> 7215.32]  can play no Dan's
[7215.32 --> 7217.42]  messaging me um Dan
[7217.42 --> 7219.24]  yeah what do you what
[7219.24 --> 7219.82]  do you want Dan
[7219.82 --> 7220.58]  whatever did you even
[7220.58 --> 7221.76]  know it was him it was
[7221.76 --> 7222.50]  him how did you know
[7222.50 --> 7226.36]  that um oh I don't
[7226.36 --> 7227.68]  know Dan you can um
[7227.68 --> 7229.22]  you guys can just
[7229.22 --> 7230.14]  curate a little bit
[7230.14 --> 7231.58]  more but yeah do you
[7231.58 --> 7232.54]  want food like should
[7232.54 --> 7233.46]  we do food during
[7233.46 --> 7234.38]  after dark I know some
[7234.38 --> 7235.16]  people hate it when we
[7235.16 --> 7235.96]  eat but we have we
[7235.96 --> 7237.46]  have um we have
[7237.46 --> 7238.50]  mute buttons now so
[7238.50 --> 7239.40]  you can only hear me
[7239.40 --> 7241.32]  sometimes and uh we
[7241.32 --> 7241.98]  have close to a
[7241.98 --> 7242.60]  thousand merch
[7242.60 --> 7243.68]  messages yeah maybe we
[7243.68 --> 7245.08]  should do food I've
[7245.08 --> 7245.96]  only got 22 and
[7245.96 --> 7248.38]  incoming yeah but when
[7248.38 --> 7249.02]  there's not that many
[7249.02 --> 7250.08]  curated you guys can
[7250.08 --> 7251.10]  probably curate more
[7251.10 --> 7255.96]  they they oh I muted
[7255.96 --> 7259.16]  my mic shots fired he
[7259.16 --> 7260.34]  said something into a
[7260.34 --> 7261.90]  muted mic that was
[7261.90 --> 7264.28]  spicy he said you guys
[7264.28 --> 7265.34]  suck at merch messages
[7265.34 --> 7266.32]  pretty much to be
[7266.32 --> 7267.24]  completely honest that's
[7267.24 --> 7268.04]  basically what he said
[7268.04 --> 7268.92]  I think it's because
[7268.92 --> 7269.94]  people are just like
[7269.94 --> 7271.34]  buying things right
[7271.34 --> 7272.48]  normally people buy
[7272.48 --> 7273.30]  stuff on the WAN show
[7273.30 --> 7273.90]  because they have a
[7273.90 --> 7274.56]  question that they want
[7274.56 --> 7275.48]  to ask it's very pointed
[7275.48 --> 7276.48]  and directed that's true
[7276.48 --> 7277.62]  that's true a lot of
[7277.62 --> 7278.46]  them have been like
[7278.46 --> 7279.36]  yay thank you for
[7279.36 --> 7281.58]  things haha you know
[7281.58 --> 7282.44]  good on day like
[7282.44 --> 7283.64]  today thanks for the
[7283.64 --> 7284.72]  cheap stuff because
[7284.72 --> 7285.60]  realistically we're
[7285.60 --> 7286.40]  gonna get to a small
[7286.40 --> 7287.18]  fraction of them but
[7287.18 --> 7288.30]  I'm super down to I'm
[7288.30 --> 7289.14]  super down to get some
[7289.14 --> 7290.32]  food I'm really hungry I
[7290.32 --> 7290.80]  don't know about you
[7290.80 --> 7291.88]  guys but I did not
[7291.88 --> 7292.82]  really get a chance I
[7292.82 --> 7295.40]  um we have uh we we
[7295.40 --> 7297.00]  have uh food delivery
[7297.00 --> 7299.28]  for the office on um two
[7299.28 --> 7300.20]  days a week and one of
[7300.20 --> 7301.72]  the days is Friday and
[7301.72 --> 7302.42]  the thing that I ordered
[7302.42 --> 7304.08]  today was like uh like a
[7304.08 --> 7306.08]  vegetarian kebab thing
[7306.08 --> 7307.86]  and I was like this is
[7307.86 --> 7310.88]  delicious for I don't
[7310.88 --> 7311.82]  know was this 23
[7311.82 --> 7313.34]  calories like I'm I'm
[7313.34 --> 7314.66]  so hungry right now

[7319.02 --> 7320.12]  than last week oh yeah
[7320.12 --> 7321.08]  not by much but a little
[7321.08 --> 7322.82]  bit um so yeah if you
[7322.82 --> 7324.10]  if you actually I can
[7324.10 --> 7325.86]  legitimately tell I
[7325.86 --> 7327.16]  hadn't looked but you
[7327.16 --> 7329.14]  can see it boobies you've
[7329.14 --> 7329.76]  got some check because
[7329.76 --> 7331.08]  you you've got the the
[7331.08 --> 7333.38]  dip here it's visible
[7333.38 --> 7335.38]  anyway you've cleavage
[7335.38 --> 7336.60]  the fashion team's gonna
[7336.60 --> 7339.52]  be so mad because like
[7339.52 --> 7342.28]  when my body changes
[7342.28 --> 7344.04]  materially it throws off
[7344.04 --> 7344.84]  like their measurements
[7344.84 --> 7345.98]  for like clothing
[7345.98 --> 7347.06]  development for the stuff
[7347.06 --> 7348.36]  that I am trying on and
[7348.36 --> 7350.00]  stuff anyway that's
[7350.00 --> 7351.80]  pretty funny yeah so um
[7351.80 --> 7353.06]  what do you guys want to
[7353.06 --> 7355.10]  eat though I don't know
[7355.10 --> 7356.28]  dude okay delivery is
[7356.28 --> 7357.16]  tough getting something
[7357.16 --> 7358.98]  that's like worth the
[7358.98 --> 7359.98]  calories from delivery is
[7359.98 --> 7361.18]  hard well wait does it
[7361.18 --> 7362.20]  have to be delivery if we
[7362.20 --> 7363.00]  don't have that many
[7363.00 --> 7364.28]  incoming is chewy working
[7364.28 --> 7365.70]  like I believe chewy's
[7365.70 --> 7367.18]  still here and I'm almost
[7367.18 --> 7368.26]  out of incoming I know
[7368.26 --> 7369.36]  it's not like technically
[7369.36 --> 7370.90]  his job but it wouldn't
[7370.90 --> 7371.84]  necessarily have to be
[7371.84 --> 7375.44]  delivery um I don't even
[7375.44 --> 7376.22]  know if that helps it
[7376.22 --> 7377.18]  might it probably does I'm
[7377.18 --> 7379.00]  sure it does I just I
[7379.00 --> 7379.72]  don't know if you guys
[7379.72 --> 7380.86]  pick a place I'll be able
[7380.86 --> 7382.82]  to find sure okay um
[7382.82 --> 7383.86]  pad thai you said pad
[7383.86 --> 7384.90]  thai you got me thinking
[7384.90 --> 7386.58]  about pad thai I'm down
[7386.58 --> 7388.50]  for pad thai fighting phone
[7388.50 --> 7389.84]  scams with AI this is
[7389.84 --> 7390.68]  actually a leftover from
[7390.68 --> 7391.46]  last week that we didn't
[7391.46 --> 7392.44]  get to but it's pretty
[7392.44 --> 7394.06]  cool Australian researchers
[7394.06 --> 7395.60]  have created an AI chat
[7395.60 --> 7396.48]  bot system that is
[7396.48 --> 7398.02]  designed to waste
[7398.02 --> 7399.58]  scammers time and
[7399.58 --> 7401.38]  resources as well as
[7401.38 --> 7403.56]  study them the system is
[7403.56 --> 7405.60]  called apathe after the
[7405.60 --> 7406.58]  Greek goddess of
[7406.58 --> 7408.68]  deception it can take on
[7408.68 --> 7410.44]  a range of personas with
[7410.44 --> 7411.88]  different ages genders and
[7411.88 --> 7414.08]  accents and is designed to
[7414.08 --> 7415.80]  keep scam callers on the
[7415.80 --> 7418.08]  phone as long as possible
[7418.08 --> 7420.04]  it's at least partially
[7420.04 --> 7421.52]  inspired by older scam
[7421.52 --> 7422.66]  baiting chat bots like
[7422.66 --> 7424.24]  Lenny a relatively simple
[7424.24 --> 7425.46]  system created in 2011
[7425.46 --> 7427.12]  that cycled through several
[7427.12 --> 7428.26]  pre-recorded lines
[7428.26 --> 7429.10]  pretending to be a
[7429.10 --> 7430.32]  forgetful and lonely old
[7430.32 --> 7432.04]  man until the scammer hung
[7432.04 --> 7434.54]  up in frustration apathe is
[7434.54 --> 7436.10]  now in use among telecom
[7436.10 --> 7437.86]  companies in Australia who
[7437.86 --> 7440.02]  have diverted around two
[7440.02 --> 7441.40]  billion I mean I know I get
[7441.40 --> 7442.82]  a lot of scam calls but like
[7442.82 --> 7445.16]  everybody is the sheer volume
[7445.16 --> 7446.78]  of this is incredible have
[7446.78 --> 7448.64]  diverted around two billion
[7448.64 --> 7450.32]  likely scam calls to the
[7450.32 --> 7451.78]  system which is also
[7451.78 --> 7452.96]  collecting information on
[7452.96 --> 7454.44]  tactics and trends and
[7454.44 --> 7455.52]  scams which are typically
[7455.52 --> 7457.04]  run by large criminal
[7457.04 --> 7459.92]  organizations authorities are
[7459.92 --> 7460.98]  hoping to use this
[7460.98 --> 7462.36]  information to warn and
[7462.36 --> 7463.84]  protect potential future
[7463.84 --> 7465.64]  victims the apathe team
[7465.64 --> 7467.32]  likewise trials different
[7467.32 --> 7468.50]  strategies for keeping the
[7468.50 --> 7469.86]  scammers on the call as long
[7469.86 --> 7471.76]  as possible and refines its
[7471.76 --> 7472.96]  output based on that
[7472.96 --> 7474.48]  information of course the
[7474.48 --> 7476.16]  scammers are going to
[7476.16 --> 7477.52]  increase their volume by
[7477.52 --> 7479.22]  moving to AI callers and
[7479.22 --> 7479.98]  we're going to have AI's
[7479.98 --> 7480.90]  talking to AI's
[7480.90 --> 7484.04]  so we have fake internet
[7484.04 --> 7485.78]  theory now it's like fake
[7485.78 --> 7487.58]  phone call theory oh my
[7487.58 --> 7489.96]  gosh all the phone calls are
[7489.96 --> 7491.86]  just robots I actually don't
[7491.86 --> 7493.26]  know where my pad thai is
[7493.26 --> 7495.84]  from uh yeah only Vance
[7495.84 --> 7498.38]  would know I literally don't
[7498.38 --> 7499.14]  know where he gets it
[7499.14 --> 7502.58]  sorry I thought this man has an
[7502.58 --> 7504.12]  executive assistant I will
[7504.12 --> 7505.52]  ask him where he gets
[7505.52 --> 7506.80]  Linus's food that he likes
[7506.80 --> 7509.30]  I know how this works I know
[7509.30 --> 7510.54]  where my chicken comes from
[7510.54 --> 7513.10]  Langley Vietnamese cuisine
[7513.10 --> 7514.82]  oh love it that's the best
[7514.82 --> 7516.32]  oh I mean I'd be down for
[7516.32 --> 7517.50]  that too but I'm also down
[7517.50 --> 7518.54]  for that pad thai are they
[7518.54 --> 7520.88]  open oh I don't know I don't
[7520.88 --> 7522.16]  know what their hours are I
[7522.16 --> 7523.16]  will check all right do you
[7523.16 --> 7524.52]  want to hit uh or we should
[7524.52 --> 7526.16]  do oh more topics no you know
[7526.16 --> 7527.50]  what we should do if we're if
[7527.50 --> 7529.38]  we're stalling for time it
[7529.38 --> 7530.48]  goes in 10 minutes don't do
[7530.48 --> 7531.52]  that that's oh yeah don't do
[7531.52 --> 7532.44]  that's mean they would
[7532.44 --> 7533.66]  totally do it for us they
[7533.66 --> 7534.50]  would but they actually
[7534.50 --> 7536.26]  specifically opened for us
[7536.26 --> 7537.52]  once without us realizing
[7537.52 --> 7540.02]  yeah I felt so bad yeah I
[7540.02 --> 7540.92]  was pretty I'm pretty sure I
[7540.92 --> 7542.06]  was there and yeah I agree
[7542.06 --> 7543.68]  yeah uh I was like I would
[7543.68 --> 7545.08]  not have asked you guys to
[7545.08 --> 7546.02]  do this and they were like
[7546.02 --> 7547.06]  no no no it's our pleasure
[7547.06 --> 7548.32]  like people from here eat
[7548.32 --> 7549.80]  there all the time like they
[7549.80 --> 7550.94]  know who all of us are but
[7550.94 --> 7551.80]  I think they were taking
[7551.80 --> 7552.88]  time off because they had
[7552.88 --> 7554.30]  like family in town and we
[7554.30 --> 7555.18]  didn't realize that they were
[7555.18 --> 7556.48]  closed and we like called the
[7556.48 --> 7558.02]  reserve or something yeah I
[7558.02 --> 7564.76]  felt terrible let's um should
[7564.76 --> 7565.72]  we do it if you're in town
[7565.72 --> 7566.64]  it's an amazing place yes
[7566.64 --> 7568.02]  okay we're moving to
[7568.02 --> 7569.36]  WAN show after dark oh Dan
[7569.36 --> 7569.98]  do you want to do it oh
[7569.98 --> 7571.94]  wait yeah yeah okay yeah
[7571.94 --> 7573.28]  sure yeah do we have any
[7573.28 --> 7574.28]  topics left I don't think
[7574.28 --> 7575.14]  so right no I think we're
[7575.14 --> 7577.02]  good on topics I mean we
[7577.02 --> 7578.06]  can talk about someone who
[7578.06 --> 7578.98]  put the WAN show on the
[7578.98 --> 7582.40]  jumbotron yeah this is great
[7582.40 --> 7585.66]  that's awesome that's super
[7585.66 --> 7587.28]  cool yeah that may be full
[7587.28 --> 7588.22]  screen it next time but you
[7588.22 --> 7589.22]  know you're doing really
[7589.22 --> 7590.60]  good yeah yeah you just
[7590.60 --> 7591.92]  don't just dim teasing
[7591.92 --> 7594.62]  obviously you leave the mouse
[7594.62 --> 7596.88]  over the transport bar also
[7596.88 --> 7599.56]  also somebody somebody flagged
[7599.56 --> 7600.74]  this for us but I wasn't
[7600.74 --> 7601.92]  really I haven't looked into
[7601.92 --> 7603.04]  it at all apparently NVIDIA
[7603.04 --> 7603.88]  just open source their
[7603.88 --> 7609.86]  driver what what like Linux no
[7609.86 --> 7612.30]  I I I I read the text really
[7612.30 --> 7613.50]  they open source their I don't
[7613.50 --> 7614.36]  know I don't know I don't
[7614.36 --> 7616.36]  know hold on two days ago
[7616.36 --> 7619.30]  uh sure whatever transitions
[7619.30 --> 7620.64]  fully toward open source GPU
[7620.64 --> 7628.36]  kernel modules this this seems
[7628.36 --> 7630.14]  this seems like a huge deal
[7630.14 --> 7634.26]  um transitioning fully to open
[7634.26 --> 7635.52]  source GPU kernel modules is the
[7635.52 --> 7636.32]  right move we're making the
[7636.32 --> 7638.64]  change in the upcoming r560
[7638.64 --> 7642.42]  driver release whoa I mean
[7642.42 --> 7647.22]  awesome how did I not heard
[7647.22 --> 7649.24]  about this I mean it was this
[7649.24 --> 7650.80]  was two days ago the sky would
[7650.80 --> 7653.28]  be yeah two days ago I mean
[7653.28 --> 7654.38]  remember there's been a lot going
[7654.38 --> 7657.40]  on like in the in the tech world
[7657.40 --> 7661.98]  so yeah I guess um uh crowd
[7661.98 --> 7665.58]  strike really really had that pop
[7665.58 --> 7668.44]  yeah super super exciting though
[7668.44 --> 7670.06]  there's not a ton of coverage about
[7670.06 --> 7671.34]  this that's weird
[7671.34 --> 7674.92]  this seems really cool is it not
[7674.92 --> 7676.66]  cool for some reason there's only
[7676.66 --> 7678.82]  uh like I I looked on YouTube
[7678.82 --> 7680.88]  NVIDIA open source driver there's
[7680.88 --> 7682.58]  one video from two hours ago and
[7682.58 --> 7684.38]  everything else is from like months
[7684.38 --> 7686.48]  or years ago there's not a lot of
[7686.48 --> 7686.88]  coverage
[7686.88 --> 7691.74]  huh there's like two comments on this
[7691.74 --> 7692.40]  blog post
[7692.40 --> 7696.20]  yeah like what it's not the whole
[7696.20 --> 7696.68]  driver
[7696.68 --> 7699.10]  it's a big step
[7699.10 --> 7703.08]  I don't know
[7703.08 --> 7706.30]  well let's uh let's let's hope that
[7706.30 --> 7708.70]  this is just another step towards
[7708.70 --> 7710.98]  being more Linux and open source
[7710.98 --> 7712.04]  friendly from NVIDIA
[7712.04 --> 7713.92]  agreed I don't think we have time to
[7713.92 --> 7716.14]  like properly write and whatnot that
[7716.14 --> 7717.94]  topic but yep hopefully it's good
[7717.94 --> 7720.00]  okay after dark Dan you got to do the
[7720.00 --> 7721.88]  thing we have different colors for
[7721.88 --> 7724.14]  after dark now right oh oh yeah you
[7724.14 --> 7725.18]  already did that thing that's it
[7725.18 --> 7727.86]  okay I guess I also need the other
[7727.86 --> 7728.26]  thing
[7728.26 --> 7734.36]  yeah you have a thing to put on I do
[7734.36 --> 7738.50]  yeah uh I don't know where it is
[7738.50 --> 7740.24]  okay it's like after dark on the floor
[7740.24 --> 7742.12]  right there or do you have it okay
[7742.12 --> 7743.78]  okay Dan's got everything yeah we've
[7743.78 --> 7745.40]  got a thing so or he does I'll tell
[7745.40 --> 7747.62]  the story uh while we kind of get set
[7747.62 --> 7749.98]  up for this um once upon a time
[7749.98 --> 7752.76]  I actually forget the full context
[7752.76 --> 7757.12]  but once upon a time dbrand uh made
[7757.12 --> 7762.74]  an offer to sponsor me to dye my hair
[7762.74 --> 7765.50]  back to the blonde color that you see
[7765.50 --> 7767.84]  in this picture right here
[7767.84 --> 7773.86]  um oh right I filmed a short circuit
[7773.86 --> 7778.00]  earlier this week where um I was given
[7778.00 --> 7778.66]  this letter
[7778.66 --> 7781.98]  dearest mr sebastian they really did
[7781.98 --> 7785.14]  send me a letter on february 10th 2024 a
[7785.14 --> 7786.60]  thread was published on your subreddit
[7786.60 --> 7788.84]  titled let oh that's what happened let's
[7788.84 --> 7791.00]  get dbrand's attention to sponsor linus to
[7791.00 --> 7793.78]  dye his hair blonde again over the past 159
[7793.78 --> 7796.40]  days we have indeed been trying to get
[7796.40 --> 7799.38]  your attention emails texts and dms have
[7799.38 --> 7801.28]  been met with non-responsive evasion not
[7801.28 --> 7803.70]  good we even went so far as to purchase the
[7803.70 --> 7807.44]  domain blonde linus.com in both american and
[7807.44 --> 7810.88]  canadian spellings during last friday's when
[7810.88 --> 7813.40]  show at precisely 23 minutes and 20 seconds you
[7813.40 --> 7816.42]  stated dbrand wanted to bring the blonde hair back
[7816.42 --> 7819.26]  i thought they were going to sponsor me to dye it again on the show or something
[7819.26 --> 7823.80]  i'm down dbrand come at me it's going to be a big bag of money or i'm not doing it
[7823.80 --> 7826.88]  though today your evasive maneuvers will be ineffective
[7826.88 --> 7832.76]  before we fork over a big bag of money we'd like to engage in the age-old tradition of
[7832.76 --> 7837.74]  try before you buy inside this box you will find hair bleach
[7837.74 --> 7840.74]  grab that grab the hair bleach turn the box around and look at it
[7840.74 --> 7846.62]  yes i've seen it i saw this on short circuit uh here i'll get you guys a
[7846.62 --> 7851.98]  better look at it yep that's um that's a picture all right that is a thing that exists
[7851.98 --> 7860.94]  use it to dye a small portion of your hair right now on camera if we like what we see
[7860.94 --> 7867.66]  you'll get your bag of money so luke didn't notice this until you guys saw earlier on the show but
[7867.66 --> 7876.46]  f***ing jake belevance who i trusted during the short circuit
[7876.46 --> 7885.70]  okay i mixed up the bleach and i was like okay i can't see what i'm doing right now it's not like
[7885.70 --> 7894.12]  i have a mirror go ahead and dye okay according to the instructions a small portion of my hair
[7894.12 --> 7899.42]  they did this huge spot put some bit put some bleach in the top of the
[7899.42 --> 7913.78]  ivan cried from laughing okay but she she actually like real tears was crying when she saw this she
[7913.78 --> 7923.28]  was like oh my god you're gonna you're it looks like a bald spot like it so incredibly worse than
[7923.28 --> 7933.68]  just doing the whole thing yeah yeah yeah so so so basically um what i said after that was bell
[7933.68 --> 7942.20]  let this let the business team know okay get in touch with dbrand they are they are sponsoring the
[7942.20 --> 7949.62]  when show tomorrow like this is not this cannot this cannot stand this for an extended period of time
[7949.62 --> 7958.64]  um so anyway i uh cat os is saying that bell did it on purpose and dbrand bribed him which honestly i
[7958.64 --> 7963.94]  believe that that would make sense i would not be surprised if that was true so anyway what we're
[7963.94 --> 7970.48]  going what we're going to do now is we are going to finish the job and i i don't know luke are you
[7970.48 --> 7975.70]  going to do the honors have you ever have you ever hair dyed before never you have never hair dyed
[7975.70 --> 7981.42]  before in the last what two months if i do this i will have cut someone's hair and dyed someone's
[7981.42 --> 7987.34]  hair so this is getting uh for the first time both yes oh this is becoming a thing might have been
[7987.34 --> 7994.50]  a small spoiler oh well they don't know whose yeah and they don't know they don't know what video
[7994.50 --> 8001.80]  it might have been for yeah um okay well i i'm not going to expect you to know how to do this but i'm
[8001.80 --> 8008.30]  gonna i'm gonna help so yeah right so i'm gonna help so basically you take this thing right here
[8008.30 --> 8015.46]  which is the developer cream okay hey it's cream for me and that yeah like you develop anything that's
[8015.46 --> 8021.04]  true okay then you dump that powder in it hold on let me just double check into this yeah into into
[8021.04 --> 8027.60]  that uh container yes why wouldn't they just do that uh well because it has a reactor yeah luke
[8027.60 --> 8033.76]  dang it uh okay this is the french side which i could read but is a lot of work uh carefully pour
[8033.76 --> 8040.34]  the entire packet yes screw the flat cap onto the developer cream bottle and shake okay so then you'll
[8040.34 --> 8047.20]  put this on and then shake it okay shake it like it's your money maker in the meantime i'm gonna give
[8047.20 --> 8054.86]  the people another lightning deal oh no pick a number uh do we have other gloves are those other
[8054.86 --> 8059.28]  gloves are these do we only have one size of glove yeah we only have one size of glove i'll get you
[8059.28 --> 8065.64]  some larger gloves okay i'll be back in a second can you really not get okay this is hilarious those
[8065.64 --> 8069.88]  are other those are other gloves these are not the same this is hilarious look at my hands in them
[8069.88 --> 8071.60]  i can't even like
[8071.60 --> 8080.46]  no i think this is the same size glove no it's not it just it just looks gigantic on my hand no
[8080.46 --> 8085.94]  they're actually different gloves let's see can you get your hand in it yeah well more easily
[8085.94 --> 8093.02]  i really do think they're the same gloves luke they're not going on they're not going on luke why
[8093.02 --> 8099.58]  are you forcing this you're being so weird about it i do i do this with gloves all the time this is
[8099.58 --> 8104.98]  i have to put these types of gloves on none of them just go on luke they are the same gloves they're
[8104.98 --> 8111.28]  not they're not look dude look dude no the first pair of gloves luke it comes with one pair of
[8111.28 --> 8116.20]  gloves he pulled these out of a package i know no he pulled these out of a box of gloves oh these
[8116.20 --> 8120.54]  are different gloves okay okay i'm not look okay yeah yeah yeah they're different you're right you're
[8120.54 --> 8124.50]  right okay i thought they were the gloves that came with the one that i opened on set for short
[8124.50 --> 8128.36]  circuit yeah no no no and it was just the other the pair from that and the pair from this because i
[8128.36 --> 8133.62]  has a box of gloves they just they just don't why does dan just have a box of gloves lying around
[8133.62 --> 8136.76]  are you that surprised maybe he's a boxer
[8136.76 --> 8141.26]  and he likes boxing gloves
[8141.26 --> 8146.96]  blow into the glove it makes it easier just a packaging enthusiast
[8146.96 --> 8152.46]  i don't think um i'd yeah i don't think that's gonna do it it's not gonna make a difference
[8152.46 --> 8157.42]  now he's just pre-moistened it before his hand i felt that too it's just gonna stick it's really
[8157.42 --> 8162.98]  it's just gonna stick yeah i could so i i think i could get my hand in this one but it's already
[8162.98 --> 8168.12]  ripping so i i would kind of destroy it so maybe if he has bigger ones that'd be great if not i'll
[8168.12 --> 8176.38]  make it work all right uh give me a number between two and six do i do it
[8176.38 --> 8185.94]  you have to give me a number this is your choice four there's free oh my god you have you know you
[8185.94 --> 8192.14]  have free will right um yeah which is why i'm picking four why you gotta pick this kind of stuff
[8192.14 --> 8198.66]  it's it's random that i pick for every time and true randomness will show weird patterns sometimes
[8198.66 --> 8201.70]  because it is actually random it's not random everything is predetermined
[8201.70 --> 8210.34]  okay we don't have every size of this but we have mystery sweatpants we've got about 150 of them
[8210.34 --> 8213.80]  and they are 11 dollars
[8213.80 --> 8225.94]  i i don't know man i it's a it's the write-off sale yeah but like it's the inventory management
[8225.94 --> 8229.92]  sale i mean look it is it is it is challenging right when you've got
[8229.92 --> 8239.38]  okay come on i can't i can't actually like you don't okay this is wait what you only got one of
[8239.38 --> 8249.60]  these thanks tynen these aren't appropriate gloves i'm starting to wonder if anyone who
[8249.60 --> 8254.42]  wears here is actually on my team they do fit they fit great that's all we had that would probably
[8254.42 --> 8261.00]  fit that were out of the large nitrials oh okay so i'll just have to try to make because these i
[8261.00 --> 8263.92]  can't there's no dexterity in me dexterity
[8263.92 --> 8271.02]  is that what you said no that is not what i said why do you have to look at them so hard
[8271.02 --> 8280.36]  is there another one that put all his points in dexterity oh my goodness no strength
[8280.36 --> 8288.76]  but if you ask him to make a low strength repetitive movement many times he's really good at that
[8288.76 --> 8291.30]  unfortunately solo party
[8291.30 --> 8297.26]  okay wait i'm making this one work i need the other glove though why are you doing it under the
[8297.26 --> 8303.12]  table it felt easier i don't know don't all you're doing is making everyone watching you more
[8303.12 --> 8311.70]  uncomfortable i'm uncomfortable i i got it i got it is there another one of this sir linus i think the
[8311.70 --> 8316.60]  box only came with one of those no no no no no no there should have been two well what's that second
[8316.60 --> 8321.88]  other glove you've got there these are the other oh no bell used the other one oh this isn't a new
[8321.88 --> 8327.16]  pack this is this is uh i i used only a little bit of it you know waste not want not so this is the
[8327.16 --> 8334.12]  original pack that they say i only need one yeah i mean sure go ahead go ahead and dump the thing okay
[8334.12 --> 8339.22]  so i put this package thingy in this thingy and then i shake it oh my god that deal is going so fast
[8339.22 --> 8344.30]  we have a bunch of yeah i wonder why we have a bunch of smalls left if you're a small go for it
[8344.30 --> 8349.18]  go for it and don't forget it's free shipping on orders over a hundred dollars free shipping
[8349.18 --> 8353.98]  you guys always complain about shipping and then i'm like whoa free shipping and you're like
[8353.98 --> 8359.52]  i don't know maybe no go for it do it do it uh dan do you want to hit me with the merch message in
[8359.52 --> 8366.08]  the meantime while luke figures out how yeah that little foray cost me 75 potentials um let's
[8366.08 --> 8372.16]  hate you i hate you so much i had it down to five uh merch messages per minute right now is at 14
[8372.16 --> 8377.30]  i haven't done the calculation let me stall for time and do that so we've been live for
[8377.30 --> 8384.12]  four hours and 16 minutes there's a calculator isn't there no i'm i made one uh and that's there's
[8384.12 --> 8387.78]  no there's a running one it's built into the thing no no but it doesn't do per second so we've
[8387.78 --> 8392.70]  been live for over four hours and 15 minutes and i've been doing one every 15 seconds for that
[8392.70 --> 8403.54]  entire time well aren't you getting help nice yeah yeah sure we are yeah uh hey lld uh what's
[8403.54 --> 8409.82]  what is it what what is it with time that you have grown to enjoy the most out of each other
[8409.82 --> 8417.52]  oh wow now you're now you guys are just fishing for the 20 minute messages
[8417.52 --> 8424.02]  what a try hard merch message um in all seriousness though um
[8424.02 --> 8432.86]  i don't know luke just gets it i don't have to explain things to luke but if i feel like talking
[8432.86 --> 8438.74]  for a long time because i don't know the sound of my own voice amuses me or because that's just
[8438.74 --> 8443.90]  something that i needed to get out uh you know he'll listen anyway even though realistically he
[8443.90 --> 8449.52]  probably knew what i was going to say there's definitely stuff i can say to luke that i can't
[8449.52 --> 8458.10]  say to almost anyone else like i would say anything to yvonne she's s plus tier but then luke is like
[8458.10 --> 8468.40]  is like s tier plus if that makes sense because he's because he's s tier plus things that i could tell
[8468.40 --> 8477.52]  yvonne but she just wouldn't fucking care about it oh i spilled i was doing so good until then
[8477.52 --> 8479.80]  oh wow you really made a mess
[8479.80 --> 8484.58]  darn it maybe you should have stared instead of touching it
[8484.58 --> 8492.24]  wow she's got all the scare points um and like there's things that yvonne would give me a courtesy
[8492.24 --> 8499.98]  chuckle for but that like you know i can indulge my inner complete toddler and and luke will reinforce
[8499.98 --> 8505.28]  my behavior you know so yeah i mean it's it's kind of like it's kind of like asking someone you know
[8505.28 --> 8509.90]  like what have you grown to enjoy about having a friend like i don't really have a ton of adult
[8509.90 --> 8517.02]  friends um like i joke about how i have none and it's funniest because i'm saying that in front of
[8517.02 --> 8521.88]  the one person whose feelings would be most hurt by me saying i don't have any friends
[8521.88 --> 8528.70]  um but i genuinely have very few i don't have i don't have time for um
[8528.70 --> 8536.24]  did you spill no i just realized what that what i'm doing it's okay you're wearing gloves
[8536.24 --> 8544.30]  you're just saying something about talking jokes there you go
[8544.30 --> 8547.74]  what have you come to enjoy
[8547.74 --> 8555.42]  he's a giver he's a giver
[8555.42 --> 8564.86]  oh my goodness friends friends in the largest quotation marks
[8564.86 --> 8572.58]  oh no um how much do i have to shave this i think you're good okay
[8572.58 --> 8578.32]  he'll tell you when it's stopped yeah do i put this thing back on it um i don't know
[8578.32 --> 8580.12]  has the cream started coming out the end yet
[8580.12 --> 8587.44]  okay okay get the towel uh so you okay now
[8587.44 --> 8593.14]  no you can't use my shower my mom's coming over later
[8593.14 --> 8600.30]  get out now you take no no you don't put that on yet you gotta put this um this is the
[8600.30 --> 8606.76]  hyper lightning cream coloring um how much it's just bleached man it's uh yeah this is
[8606.76 --> 8613.48]  how much uh all of it oh what yeah do it you coward i think are you only supposed to put in part of it
[8613.48 --> 8623.02]  uh uh oh yeah oh yeah all of it squeeze the contents in and then uh shake until the mixture is
[8623.02 --> 8630.70]  rich and creamy that's actually in here all right rich and creamy
[8630.70 --> 8633.14]  um
[8633.14 --> 8640.74]  what are we talking about i don't i think this was a merch oh yeah what have you grown to enjoy the
[8640.74 --> 8647.36]  most out of each other well he enjoys fondling i guess look are you a cuddler
[8647.36 --> 8651.40]  uh don't answer that it's such a manageable size
[8651.40 --> 8658.56]  i can't actually kind of answer that to a certain degree without being that weird uh i sweat a lot
[8658.56 --> 8663.78]  so like i don't actually like it that much um unless it's like cold but it's rarely cold
[8663.78 --> 8672.16]  yeah that's fair okay moving on uh hey linus luke and dan has anyone from the canadian government
[8672.16 --> 8677.92]  or military ever approached you about collaboration to help with recruiting tech focused people would
[8677.92 --> 8684.48]  you be interested the canadian military reached out to us once about sponsoring something or maybe
[8684.48 --> 8692.06]  it was like doing a tour of one of our decrepit military things or something i i forget what
[8692.06 --> 8697.52]  exactly it was okay i i make fun of the canadian military because realistically everyone does uh but
[8697.52 --> 8703.14]  why would you make fun of our boat but we steve and dave in the canoe will be very upset
[8703.14 --> 8712.28]  yeah we uh we we we upgraded the we upgraded the engines um we now have huskies running on the on
[8712.28 --> 8718.42]  hamster wheels inside instead of actual hamsters um yeah i mean we we have some we have some hardware
[8718.42 --> 8724.24]  that would actually make for a pretty cool video uh but i i don't remember why it just it never really
[8724.24 --> 8730.58]  worked out but yeah potentially i don't know that i necessarily want to be a mouthpiece for military
[8730.58 --> 8736.98]  recruitment um like like a like a hard sell but if you guys just wanted to show off some cool stuff
[8736.98 --> 8741.06]  you're doing or whatever else and i could i could see there maybe being some synergies there
[8741.06 --> 8747.06]  i guess i have to lose my i guess i gotta lose my headphones for a little bit and uh yeah oh i guess we
[8747.06 --> 8752.42]  we didn't really give any thought to how to handle the audio of this i guess i'm on merch messages and luke is on
[8752.42 --> 8760.82]  um this uh okay so dan do you wanna are you able to actually make that camera a little wider also i
[8760.82 --> 8767.30]  don't think it's in focus yep minor minor details and i guess i will i will just start reading from
[8767.30 --> 8772.74]  the curated merch messages for a little bit while this happens i don't know what to do i just you
[8772.74 --> 8778.90]  basically your hair and then rub it around or what so i don't know if they can hear you or not but
[8779.62 --> 8790.34]  yikes um double yikes that's good enough yeah anywho um i have never done this before where part of it
[8790.34 --> 8796.18]  is like already done already died try to work around that area yeah so i do all of it because that area
[8796.18 --> 8800.98]  should be the same color or would that over bleach that no it would it would double bleach that area and
[8800.98 --> 8806.66]  like i don't know maybe it'll fall out so in in theory in theory you're supposed to kind of avoid
[8806.66 --> 8811.62]  the scalp but when you're bleach yeah i know when you're bleaching the whole thing i've always felt
[8811.62 --> 8817.78]  like that's kind of a stupid like cya instruction because if someone's hair all falls out then they
[8817.78 --> 8821.14]  can be like well we told you not to rub it on the scalp but realistically how are you going to dye
[8821.14 --> 8826.26]  your whole head all the way down to the roots without getting any bloody dye or bleach on the scalp that
[8826.26 --> 8834.98]  doesn't that doesn't compute for me uh so if i had to guess i would say go for the heaviest application
[8835.70 --> 8842.82]  um everywhere except where it's already bleached and maybe just go for a very very light application
[8842.82 --> 8850.02]  there and all of this assumes that your nozzle and head massage control is a lot better than jake
[8850.02 --> 8857.22]  belevance who claims that he actually tried to do a small spot but it just spiraled out of control
[8859.70 --> 8866.74]  so um i want to make it super clear i have no idea what i'm doing yeah we we um we get it oh my god
[8869.22 --> 8877.30]  not a great start oh we're yeah this is this is incredible um i hope we get some like really serious
[8877.30 --> 8883.30]  questions anonymous asks could you talk any more about the small backpack and what you're aiming
[8883.30 --> 8887.54]  for or what the design process has been like i heard you mentioned recently it's still a long way from
[8887.54 --> 8893.06]  completion i actually are you gonna did you take the top cap oh you did you you may want to put it on
[8893.06 --> 8897.94]  your hand yeah and you may want to yeah you yeah you may want yeah yeah there you go you may want to
[8897.94 --> 8902.10]  hold the bottle in the in the good hand and then the yeah yeah you're good so you could just put it on
[8902.10 --> 8905.94]  your hand it's basically like add a ton more because i added that i want to see how much it
[8905.94 --> 8911.46]  just do it like putting in shampoo okay yeah okay so this is totally nice
[8914.18 --> 8918.58]  you're gonna want to do more of like yeah like do you not wash your hair like do you know how to
[8918.58 --> 8924.82]  do you know how shampoo works yeah there we there we go is that right okay well i don't know i didn't
[8924.82 --> 8930.82]  know it was the same yeah it's a funny thing like um i i've thought about this sometimes when i've had to
[8930.82 --> 8935.38]  do acting things for for our videos i'm not an actor but occasionally i'll have to do something
[8935.38 --> 8941.06]  that's like kind of an acting thing and it occurs to me sometimes that um and actually it was when i
[8941.06 --> 8947.46]  was showering on camera for some reason i was like i've never thought about if the way that i shower is
[8947.46 --> 8956.82]  normal yeah right like i you know is top to bottom chill is it is it dirtiest parts first is it last is
[8956.82 --> 8961.86]  it like like i've never really thought about if i if i do it right i actually really wish i had two
[8961.86 --> 8966.10]  glove tanks you're gonna need way more of this yeah i just yeah there's a lot of it in one spot i got
[8966.10 --> 8974.34]  you gloves compensate compensate by putting more of it everywhere okay okay the the longer you spend
[8974.34 --> 8984.42]  on it the more unevenly bleached it will be getting it all on there is pretty good um anyway as for the
[8984.42 --> 8989.70]  small backpack i got a new sample so we've reduced the number of pockets but we've got more of like
[8989.70 --> 8996.74]  a pocket of holding now which is really nice and we have um we have put a little bit more thought
[8996.74 --> 9006.98]  into how our pocket layout is going to work and how weird is this for you it's not that bad for me i'm just getting to work
[9006.98 --> 9013.38]  it's not the most normal thing that i've ever experienced you need so much more of this just
[9013.38 --> 9019.94]  yeah is it supposed to be like white just give her yeah just yeah just give her um it's a long way
[9019.94 --> 9026.18]  from completion still but i have one that i can start daily driving again i just haven't um
[9028.26 --> 9031.54]  i haven't started doing it yet i've just been really busy this week and i haven't had time to
[9031.54 --> 9041.46]  move all of my stuff over okay cool uh dan you want to hit me with a merch message uh yeah sure
[9041.46 --> 9047.78]  let's see um linus as an owner of your own small own business do you ever feel like your employees
[9047.78 --> 9053.94]  don't have the same passion you do how do you cope with this hashtag asking for a friend happy cs
[9053.94 --> 9061.30]  disaster day huh it's tough because everybody's motivation for doing what they do is completely
[9061.30 --> 9067.06]  different some people do what they do purely out of passion and would do the exact same thing
[9067.06 --> 9072.98]  whether they made any money or not some people do things purely for the money and absolutely hate
[9072.98 --> 9079.54]  everything about it other than their paycheck and then realistically almost everyone is somewhere in
[9079.54 --> 9086.50]  between on that spectrum do i feel like they don't have the same passion i do absolutely i i i do what
[9086.50 --> 9092.18]  i do because it's what i would have done anyway and there's very very few people who fall completely
[9092.18 --> 9101.86]  into that category um to be clear i also have to eat and the money is absolutely a factor i was very
[9101.86 --> 9108.02]  very upfront from day one that when we split off from ncix this was my job we were starting a company
[9108.02 --> 9112.90]  and it was going to need to be sustainable which means it was going to need to be profitable and grow and
[9112.90 --> 9120.26]  hire people and you know do all those things um but it is what i would have been doing in my free time
[9120.26 --> 9126.02]  chatting with people about tech anyway i just have to do a lot of you know business stuff that i
[9126.02 --> 9134.82]  frankly am a lot less passionate about uh on top of that you're doing you're doing this luke what i was
[9134.82 --> 9139.86]  going to say you're doing great but then i realized that there's no possible way i'm doing great we have an
[9139.86 --> 9148.26]  honest relationship and i don't really feel that way you may at some point wish to yeah i'm doing that
[9148.26 --> 9163.46]  right now okay cool um yeah so dbrand sponsored this for those of you who are tuning in late
[9163.46 --> 9170.66]  and i'm fairly certain that this is what i'm going to look like afterward how certain if it's anything
[9170.66 --> 9178.10]  other than this then i'm asking l'oreal for a refund do you think you need more stuff or less stuff way
[9178.10 --> 9187.30]  more way you got to saturate it all right saturate that biz like especially here has like nothing oh man
[9187.30 --> 9195.54]  okay um okay dan oh wait how do i cope with it well you cope with it by learning to manage right like
[9195.54 --> 9202.50]  you um everyone has different styles so you you you make the company a place that people want to work
[9202.50 --> 9207.86]  in different ways if they're not quite as passionate as you are about you know it widgets or whatever
[9207.86 --> 9214.58]  else um neither of you guys showed up but one of the examples is you know extracurricular activities
[9214.58 --> 9220.10]  that are fun for people we had softball night last night it was flipping awesome we had a 20 we
[9220.10 --> 9227.30]  actually we had over 20 people turn up for it which you know sounds like okay yeah that's a softball
[9227.30 --> 9232.90]  night right but that was our biggest that was our biggest turnout ever and if you think about it a
[9232.90 --> 9238.74]  little more that's a fifth of the company softball light is freaking popular and it's freaking awesome
[9239.46 --> 9245.94]  um so yeah whether it's whether it's events or perks or or pay or uh working conditions uh you know one
[9245.94 --> 9250.82]  of the things that we feel very strongly about is that warehouse workers uh deserve air conditioning too
[9251.38 --> 9257.70]  the vast majority of the warehouses in the lower mainland do not have air conditioning and uh ours do
[9257.70 --> 9263.38]  because we think our logistics team deserves to not sweat like pigs all day every day i know that's
[9263.38 --> 9271.06]  an expression pigs don't actually sweat but yeah chill okay hit me dan linus with it being a month
[9271.06 --> 9278.26]  since the ally x video i'm curious to know have you been playing it since then if so what games have you
[9278.26 --> 9284.66]  tried on it uh the ally x is to my knowledge still under review embargo so if i was to share with you
[9284.66 --> 9292.66]  anything other than what i said in the first video i would probably be doing a bad so um and the truth
[9292.66 --> 9298.66]  is that that was a pre-production hardware piece anyway so i haven't been playing with it there's
[9298.66 --> 9302.98]  nothing for me to glean from it other than that i like the ergonomics which i already knew from doing
[9302.98 --> 9313.14]  the first video oh goodness okay what do you guys think is he doing a good job oh now there's some bleach on
[9313.14 --> 9317.38]  my keyboard no no you're good now my eyes sting you're doing great luke
[9319.86 --> 9324.66]  just make just make sure you get everything please that's what i'm currently working on is making sure
[9324.66 --> 9332.66]  there's no dead spots people are saying no using too little i don't know like no one told me how much
[9332.66 --> 9340.74]  to use all of it yeah that wasn't said until after i was already going is all of it on there now no no
[9340.74 --> 9346.18]  no he's used like get the rest on there half just to get it on his hair before he dies
[9348.82 --> 9352.90]  well all right before he doesn't die before he dies oh
[9354.66 --> 9356.98]  because it's gonna get worse you can tell luke is
[9356.98 --> 9370.18]  what's that okay what's that face there okay yeah that's a strong that's a strong uh smell and um
[9370.82 --> 9378.18]  everything else about everything else that is happening right now temple oh my god okay dan hit me
[9378.18 --> 9385.22]  uh sure on the wrong tab ends of the front if i just have like oh you've got the ends are good
[9385.22 --> 9391.78]  brown tips it's gonna look pretty stupid okay uh greetings to everyone question for all three of
[9391.78 --> 9398.26]  you what is the most seriously that was the solution solution you've ever had while troubleshooting oh
[9398.26 --> 9406.66]  oh oh man there's gotta be so many of those but remembering them might be yeah i feel like i i often
[9406.66 --> 9417.38]  just block these things from my mind um i've gotta man there's gotta be something with like uh
[9418.26 --> 9423.86]  like a ram something oh i remember okay i've got i've had scrapyard wars on the brain
[9423.86 --> 9432.82]  and i think the most seriously that was the solution was was uh was scrapyard wars 4 with bob with bob and
[9432.82 --> 9442.66]  rod okay so it didn't really make it into the cut very well we were under extreme time pressure to get
[9442.66 --> 9448.42]  those bloody videos out and the editors weren't the same ones who shot it so they weren't necessarily
[9448.42 --> 9454.82]  there for every crazy moment in the last episode we kind of allude to this really quickly but honestly
[9454.82 --> 9461.86]  it would be pretty cool to dig back into the archive at some point pull this footage out and like do a
[9461.86 --> 9472.18]  float plane exclusive video on what happened because we had a motherboard that either worked and then didn't
[9472.18 --> 9480.18]  or we broke it or we broke it something happened and it ended up with scratched traces on it it was and it was
[9480.18 --> 9488.58]  dead it was not working and i don't remember if it was bob's idea or if it was my idea but somehow we came up
[9488.58 --> 9501.30]  with the idea of bypassing the broken trace by jumpering one of the fan headers onto another fan header or something
[9502.74 --> 9511.54]  it was absolutely wild we did it the system powered up and was stable throughout testing so we were
[9511.54 --> 9516.58]  able to complete if it hadn't worked we would have not had a working computer you want an interesting
[9516.58 --> 9521.22]  follow-up on that story apparently it was bob who bodged the wire i apparently doubted him the whole
[9521.22 --> 9526.42]  time that that checks out i don't i don't blame you for doubting him that was a crazy thing to do and
[9526.42 --> 9531.86]  i'm surprised it worked you want to follow up to that story yes i ended up buying that motherboard and see
[9531.86 --> 9538.02]  you bought that motherboard i did it's still running isn't it gave it to my brother it still works it
[9538.02 --> 9544.50]  still works that is sick no particular maintenance on it nothing's ever gone wrong it's not like the
[9544.50 --> 9548.74]  fan stopped working nothing happened everything's been fine as far as my understanding goes maybe he
[9548.74 --> 9556.42]  didn't tell me those things okay so have you saturated it i don't know i think so it seems pretty
[9556.42 --> 9563.06]  saturated to me well i can't see there's like goop everywhere but like i don't know okay i've never
[9563.06 --> 9566.98]  done this before do you have all the way to the roots at the front there i don't think so yeah watch
[9566.98 --> 9575.22]  those bang roots there's goo at the roots i don't know okay cool okay oh man it really looks like at the
[9575.22 --> 9583.78]  at the front here you have temples temples in the bangs okay i was pointing here but sure oh yeah
[9583.78 --> 9593.94]  that's not done oh i thought i got this part but apparently not eyebrows serenity now no uh no this
[9593.94 --> 9600.02]  is not designed for eyebrows this is the really strong stuff that is designed for the head okay dan hit me
[9600.02 --> 9609.06]  uh let's see uh what's up ll and d what was your best trip or vacation that wasn't planned
[9609.06 --> 9613.94]  i don't think i've ever taken a vacation that wasn't planned do people take unplanned vacations
[9614.66 --> 9621.06]  uh those seem like crazy people how does that happen you just like end up leaving i don't know like i
[9621.06 --> 9625.38]  i've definitely known people that are like oh yeah i'll just like start driving and i'll like arrive
[9625.38 --> 9634.18]  somewhere um but i have never i've never done that okay so you've got it saturated everywhere now i
[9634.18 --> 9639.46]  think so but i haven't used all the goop okay if you've got it saturated everywhere and you're 100
[9639.46 --> 9644.82]  certain then we're gonna have you dyed hair not for a very long time okay can you run over here and
[9644.82 --> 9651.30]  evaluate okay okay okay dan's apparently gonna come take a look so i guess i will find another merch
[9651.30 --> 9656.98]  message this one is from alan j oh actually no you know what i'll do is i'll do less here because
[9656.98 --> 9665.22]  it was already done back there the last crazy deal i think is gone it's not probably okay oh no we still
[9665.22 --> 9677.30]  have 14 small mystery sweatpants for 11 do it you cowards if you want i don't know uh luke yeah give me
[9677.30 --> 9689.38]  a number please four between like all over here four okay that looks very gooped to me but i will add goop
[9692.82 --> 9697.78]  it's not about the goop quantity it's about working it into the hair oh my god thank you
[9697.78 --> 9707.06]  dan for helping him because this was very painful um i can't imagine why okay in here it's 50 off
[9707.70 --> 9717.94]  the technicolor keys desk pad oh that's a cool design um yep once again we don't have a flipping
[9717.94 --> 9725.86]  ton of these uh we've only got a little over a hundred and they are going to be yeah 50 off 15 bucks
[9727.78 --> 9734.50]  i am setting it active now so if you need a desk pad this is a great deal don't forget we've got free
[9734.50 --> 9744.82]  shipping on orders over a hundred dollars this is the most unhinged wan show that i think has ever wan showed
[9747.06 --> 9747.62]  here it is
[9750.42 --> 9755.62]  good reviews cool design great packaging courtesy of sarah butt here's what it looks like with a
[9755.62 --> 9761.30]  a keyboard and a mouse on it i am so stressed right now um cool
[9764.42 --> 9764.74]  okay
[9768.42 --> 9777.46]  uh alan j says linus media group and lld i'm starting a manufacturing startup and struggling to keep up with
[9777.46 --> 9784.90]  deadlines as my family's farm helping support the startup demands 12 plus hour days seven days a week
[9785.62 --> 9786.58]  advice sheesh
[9788.90 --> 9796.10]  okay oh this is a tough one because you know the last thing i want to tell you is give up on your
[9796.10 --> 9804.18]  manufacturing startup dream and the second last thing i want to tell you is you know let your family know
[9804.18 --> 9811.54]  that they need to take a hike but what i can tell you is you've got to set boundaries
[9811.54 --> 9819.70]  um there are as you've discovered only so many hours in a day alan and if you've if you've if you've
[9819.70 --> 9827.22]  got you know it's if you've got a dream and you've got your heart set on something um and your family
[9827.22 --> 9833.38]  family is supportive then hopefully they can find a way to
[9839.14 --> 9841.78]  hopefully they can find a way to support what you're doing as
[9842.34 --> 9846.98]  like it's actually important in exchange or not in exchange i mean it's family it shouldn't be in
[9846.98 --> 9852.26]  exchange hopefully you guys can be mutually supportive of each other have an honest conversation
[9852.26 --> 9859.22]  conversation that's the most important thing honest conversation about what is feasible for you
[9859.94 --> 9867.46]  what they need from you and how you can mutually achieve your goals because communication is clearly
[9867.46 --> 9873.22]  an issue here if you're asking me rather than talking to them about it and i'm not saying you've
[9873.22 --> 9879.22]  done anything wrong i'm just saying that um obviously the current situation isn't working and you're
[9879.22 --> 9888.66]  going to need to do something so hard to take linus serious right now um okay so are we good i don't
[9888.66 --> 9894.02]  know i feel like it but i've never done this before okay we're good so the next thing that i need is a
[9894.02 --> 9900.50]  plastic bag do i do i have a plastic bag do we have a plastic bag in the house luke go ahead and have a
[9900.50 --> 9908.18]  seat all right well i should probably put this somewhere just any plastic bag uh yeah you could just just
[9908.18 --> 9915.22]  uh make it inside out and then uh it's good or oh yeah that's not the uh anyway uh good luck with
[9915.22 --> 9920.90]  that is he even going to be able to remove the glove yeah i'm not sure yeah i'm trying to do it without
[9920.90 --> 9931.06]  like being messy um okay thanks dan uh yeah yeah yeah very funny uh okay
[9931.06 --> 9939.22]  uh okay uh these dyes tend to work a little bit better with heat same with bleach
[9941.62 --> 9946.90]  so i'm just gonna get a bit of a plastic helmet going on here and um
[9948.74 --> 9952.98]  let it set for a little bit longer luke took so long that realistically
[9952.98 --> 9961.70]  there's not much leave-in time left but i can't have the parts that he just did rinsed now so
[9962.98 --> 9968.26]  don't worry about it guys um realistically i used to leave these things in for probably about
[9968.26 --> 9972.90]  double what they recommend in the box with the heat helmet so um
[9974.42 --> 9977.54]  if i was gonna if i was gonna lose all my hair it would have happened before
[9977.54 --> 9984.26]  i think my teachers sucked to be completely honest because somebody told me at the beginning
[9984.26 --> 9988.74]  that it maybe doesn't have to go on the scalp and i'm like okay i'm gonna take i'm gonna take some
[9988.74 --> 9992.18]  advice from that and then somebody else is like actually you need to massage it in
[9993.38 --> 9998.10]  what are you guys saying we said it was like shampoo no one said amount of time nobody said until i was
[9998.10 --> 10001.62]  significantly through that i had to use the entire we said it was like shampoo
[10001.62 --> 10007.30]  do you shampoo you know what goofy boys you know it doesn't matter shampoo that can't touch your scalp
[10007.30 --> 10013.14]  dan hit me yeah what uh terrible teachers what about using conditioner that's not supposed to go
[10013.14 --> 10018.90]  on your scalp yeah wait it's not no i put i man i i just go ham with the conditioner definitely
[10018.90 --> 10025.54]  i mean your hair is so short it doesn't actually matter oh okay oh uh i have adhd and work in startups
[10025.54 --> 10031.54]  i enjoy hearing linus talk about his experiences in his professional life what are the aspects
[10031.54 --> 10038.58]  of adhd he thinks benefit him and what is his advice to others i mean hyper focus is the one benefit
[10038.58 --> 10045.62]  that i can think of with adhd when it's on the right thing i will have absolutely zero productivity
[10045.62 --> 10051.38]  and then i'll be like minutes from my deadline and i will get an hour of work done in those minutes
[10051.38 --> 10057.06]  um it's not because i want to procrastinate it's yeah i'm probably not going to use it it's not because
[10057.06 --> 10066.18]  i want to procrastinate it's more just that i find it almost impossible to focus until the moment when
[10066.18 --> 10075.62]  i need to focus um i'd say that's the biggest one as for advice to others do everything you can to stay
[10075.62 --> 10081.86]  organized write down everything because one of my biggest distractions can be forgetting a good idea and
[10081.86 --> 10087.54]  trying to get it back and then i end up missing out on probably five other good ideas in the time
[10087.54 --> 10092.58]  that i spent thinking about that um that one that i would the one that got away i think that's the
[10092.58 --> 10098.74]  other thing too is um adhd again another superpower is that you're kind of going in a hundred different
[10098.74 --> 10102.58]  directions at once and i think in a creative industry like we're in that can be a benefit as
[10102.58 --> 10107.62]  much as it can be a challenge it can be helpful one of the biggest things i've done in managing people
[10107.62 --> 10114.02]  with adhd that's been helpful is creating uh sacred time for them to stay in flow and stay focused
[10115.22 --> 10123.78]  very helpful all right um stinks you guys oh yeah it stinks you guys got a couple that you can do
[10123.78 --> 10131.30]  while i run to the shower i'm sure yeah yeah wish me luck guys god this is this is very blonde already
[10131.30 --> 10135.70]  there's bits that aren't so that bodes well
[10138.90 --> 10139.70]  let's just do it again
[10145.38 --> 10152.02]  he looks so bemused i think i think you did a good job luke that that face means he's bits i think
[10152.02 --> 10154.90]  he's i think you you dyed most of his skin as well
[10154.90 --> 10160.18]  did you you tried not to get it on his skin you guys are gonna drive me nuts man right well you
[10160.18 --> 10167.06]  should have worn the gloves that i bought you i just i don't know i thought i needed dexterity
[10167.06 --> 10172.90]  nobody told me it was just smash it into the skull it wasn't smashing the skull it was very like
[10174.66 --> 10180.74]  you know forget it forget it uh short tall and regular sized luke how do you know you've nailed
[10180.74 --> 10188.50]  a work-life balance how would i know that's why i wanted to ask this because haha let me know when
[10188.50 --> 10195.22]  you find out yeah um the thing is either of the people currently present are 100 work
[10197.46 --> 10198.82]  that is technically a balance
[10202.66 --> 10208.74]  you did not you did not specify what kind of ratio that you like it's really easy to not have a life
[10208.74 --> 10211.46]  when you just do work and then you don't have to worry about a whole bunch of things
[10212.98 --> 10221.22]  yeah i think i mean neither of us have a child so oh my for me if i'm not doing uh what i call work
[10221.22 --> 10227.70]  work which is work here yeah um then i'm probably gonna find ways to do other forms of it basically
[10227.70 --> 10234.34]  fun work yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think that's a good balance if you if you asked me if i would have
[10234.34 --> 10240.26]  done that when i was a kid i would have said obviously not and now i do it so it is what it is
[10240.82 --> 10250.98]  i do my fun work for work work too yeah yeah i just like working here it's fun i find oh my gosh
[10253.94 --> 10261.06]  oh okay thank you so nice why'd you say oh my gosh because the food's here oh i was excited for a
[10261.06 --> 10269.06]  second no sorry hello thank you hopefully this is from the right place we couldn't get a hold of
[10271.70 --> 10278.74]  thank you so much i appreciate you thank you uh work-life balance bad uh let's see what else
[10279.62 --> 10284.42]  yeah i don't know i'm not necessarily saying work-life balance is bad i i try to defend it for
[10284.98 --> 10288.10]  my my people as much as i can i just don't defend it for myself
[10288.10 --> 10292.18]  um but i also know what works for me my
[10295.30 --> 10301.14]  i i kind of do this all the time so sometimes i'll be like super dialed in and then other times i'm not
[10301.14 --> 10308.66]  as dialed in and it just kind of flows and i allow that to flow and my low point is you know i'm there
[10308.66 --> 10313.62]  for eight hours a day and i'm putting in good work my high point is like i need to do stuff my brain just
[10313.62 --> 10318.74]  like wants to work on things and then i end up putting in more but it is what it is i find that
[10318.74 --> 10324.90]  it's also important to not get upset with yourself when you're in those low points yeah i found for a
[10324.90 --> 10331.30]  very long time i was getting down on myself for you know just getting eight hours of work done or maybe
[10331.30 --> 10339.38]  nine you know do a couple hours at home that's not very good uh and kind of pushing for those 12 hours
[10339.38 --> 10346.18]  and yeah that can be dangerous so if your work-life balance if you have a healthy relationship with
[10346.18 --> 10352.82]  yourself yes then it can be healthy at no matter what side of the scale it's on yeah if i'm if my
[10352.82 --> 10358.98]  brain isn't in hyper work mode you got to be okay with letting yourself not be in that yeah if my brain's
[10358.98 --> 10364.74]  in hyper if if my brain is not in hyper work mode what i try to do is resist the temptation to
[10364.74 --> 10370.58]  degen super hard into really bad things and what i'll do is instead try to focus on like you know
[10370.58 --> 10376.42]  what uh brain's not really feeling like getting certain work goals done this week instead i'm
[10376.42 --> 10382.34]  gonna try to walk really far or like a huge amount of total steps this week or like i'll make sure i'm
[10382.34 --> 10388.10]  really consistent at the gym or like find some other thing that i can do that gets the dopamine wheel
[10388.10 --> 10392.98]  spinning in a good way instead of like a doom scrolling way or something like that
[10394.90 --> 10399.86]  dopamine control is probably what i would say especially for adhd people as well dopamine
[10399.86 --> 10410.98]  control is an extremely difficult thing to manage and to maintain yeah scary okay let's see what else we
[10410.98 --> 10418.66]  got mm-hmm glass is gonna be so pissed i don't even take full blame i got like no training yeah i don't
[10418.66 --> 10425.46]  know i don't know whatever happens uh hello lld as a person busy with my work as a software developer
[10425.46 --> 10430.82]  how do you balance putting extra time into work versus personal development in order to become a
[10430.82 --> 10439.22]  better professional it's like the same question not exactly but it's very similar i mean i've been going
[10439.22 --> 10446.82]  up and down the list here because this person's kind of saying like okay become a better professional do i
[10446.82 --> 10451.78]  do that through doing my own work or do i do that towards putting extra time into work
[10453.30 --> 10458.74]  do i want to be a better me or do i want to be a better career person i think is basically the crux of
[10458.74 --> 10465.30]  this maybe that's a very personal question and i think can change depending on the scenario and stuff
[10465.30 --> 10470.50]  so like could they they don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive if you're a better you you
[10470.50 --> 10473.38]  become a better professional yeah that's totally a thing
[10475.94 --> 10481.14]  yeah rising tide makes all the ships in the sea
[10481.14 --> 10491.46]  yes yep not my goat not my horse or whatever the saying is uh let's see what else i got here
[10492.66 --> 10501.94]  so many of these are things i think linus would want to like have an in on yeah um these are hard
[10501.94 --> 10512.50]  uh oh i can hear him oh he sounds angry yeah he does he's like he's doing a lot of yelling he is
[10513.54 --> 10516.10]  and storming about i just heard him i heard a
[10520.74 --> 10523.06]  crashing about he's gonna be so upset
[10523.06 --> 10529.06]  oh god oh oh god oh he's walking above us right now
[10531.38 --> 10535.78]  face time of on live we should do that he's not gonna be able to facetime but he should he
[10535.78 --> 10541.78]  should video call a vaughn i mean she could just watch wanger i want us i know you say you don't
[10541.78 --> 10546.74]  like presents do you like cards i don't think he really particularly likes anything but it depends
[10547.94 --> 10550.66]  there have been ones of both that he has liked
[10553.06 --> 10555.06]  you
[10559.54 --> 10560.10]  i hear him
[10561.78 --> 10564.10]  ah what oh that's not fair
[10565.86 --> 10571.38]  it's not fair okay wait wait wait you haven't revealed yet uh what if you what if you video call
[10571.38 --> 10576.90]  yvonne you want me to video call yvonne i think so uh i don't know if they can hear me right now
[10576.90 --> 10580.98]  yes they can yes what's that they can hear you okay what's up y'all
[10583.06 --> 10589.86]  all right that was a good idea i i wasn't sure why you're upstairs that makes sense i thought you
[10589.86 --> 10594.02]  were yelling at us showmanship kind of did too no it's good it's good presentation
[10594.02 --> 10602.74]  all right uh hold on i'm gonna call on um a data application rather than phone
[10602.74 --> 10613.54]  hello hey lady you are live on the wan show
[10613.54 --> 10623.30]  yvonne can you hear me uh yeah i can hear you just fine you're live on the wan show
[10624.58 --> 10628.34]  okay um what's up well we did a thing today
[10628.34 --> 10635.94]  did you finish dying your hair um well here's the thing
[10637.62 --> 10643.94]  you know how i've dyed my hair like over a dozen times and i'm pretty experienced at it and um
[10643.94 --> 10650.90]  you know with nothing but a mirror and some common sense i can do a pretty good job of it
[10653.06 --> 10654.18]  did luke or dan do it
[10656.82 --> 10662.02]  luke did it and not only has he never dyed hair before he doesn't appear to have ever shampooed
[10662.02 --> 10666.58]  hair either you told me not to put it on the scalp you put shampoo on you you work shampoo into your
[10666.58 --> 10674.26]  scalp i just what do you my teacher was really bad i i i maintain this okay i don't know if it can be
[10674.26 --> 10681.46]  worse than yesterday honestly um we'll see i was literally crying yesterday i have a feeling the
[10681.46 --> 10687.86]  sideburns aren't uh fully done there's some other things there that's gonna put you on his mic sure
[10687.86 --> 10694.82]  and then turn on video calling okay wait is it on that means that means i need to put my my phone on
[10694.82 --> 10704.90]  speaker one sec oh you can put on the video feed that's fine she can't see yet you gotta put her like
[10704.90 --> 10713.14]  right on the tip okay okay we good yeah
[10713.14 --> 10724.74]  well it's everywhere it's just orange
[10727.78 --> 10732.10]  no why is it orange why is it orange do you not leave it in long enough
[10735.14 --> 10740.82]  it does seem to be everywhere it doesn't seem that bad honestly i was expecting way worse
[10740.82 --> 10748.02]  is there everywhere the certain tips are just darker it's fine it's supposed to be that way
[10748.02 --> 10753.30]  uh-huh can we do it again it's called orange flame it's a it's a design can we do it again
[10754.10 --> 10755.94]  is that is that okay if we do it twice
[10759.22 --> 10766.02]  okay see the brown spot you can snip that uh-huh that's fine i don't know i haven't even seen the
[10766.02 --> 10772.26]  rest of it yet so uh oh no how's the okay how's the blending on the the previous circle
[10773.62 --> 10779.94]  the spot in the back is still there i don't know yeah it's brighter she says the spot in the back is
[10779.94 --> 10781.30]  still there you can tell it's brighter
[10784.90 --> 10790.10]  do you have more can i help you fix it i don't know if you can help fix this but we're certainly not
[10790.10 --> 10799.78]  gonna do it with luke's help so i'll let you go now hon okay bye bye it really does look orange
[10799.78 --> 10804.98]  it's really very orange well i told you i used to leave them in for about double the amount of time
[10804.98 --> 10809.46]  that they say on the package but i was seeing how much it was lightening under the thing but i
[10809.46 --> 10816.74]  think i was seeing areas like this where you you know put die 15 minutes before you put it in other
[10816.74 --> 10826.82]  places do you want me to have a go or is it is it possible to try again no yeah you certainly
[10826.82 --> 10834.98]  shouldn't try again like the same day um wow this is probably the best result for dbrand to be
[10834.98 --> 10841.22]  perfectly honest man we're gonna have to start pushing the ltt hat pro in our videos a lot i
[10841.22 --> 10847.62]  unironically think it looks pretty all right it doesn't look like it's supposed to i i look like
[10847.62 --> 10852.50]  it looks kind of cool i look like i'm going through a midlife crisis you look like you're supposed to be
[10852.50 --> 10857.78]  in like a early 2000s punk band sponsored by deep no i look like i was in an early 2000s punk band
[10857.78 --> 10864.10]  in the early 2000s grew out of it yeah yeah yeah that makes sense johnny rotten had better hair look at the back
[10864.98 --> 10872.34]  there's like a there's like a brown ring it's kind of much of the same yeah yeah yeah
[10874.74 --> 10878.50]  i think it looks cool it just doesn't even sort of remotely look like what's it's supposed to
[10879.46 --> 10886.50]  based on the box oh wow those uh those desk pads are gone well um do you want another one should we do
[10886.50 --> 10892.10]  should we do more there's some pretty crazy stuff yeah also that's another thing chat disagreed with you
[10892.10 --> 10901.46]  guys all the time about what chat was saying you rinsed it way too soon oh chat we're also saying
[10902.90 --> 10908.98]  the soap analogy or the yeah the soap analogy was bad no no shampoo is fine if you just put it i i've
[10908.98 --> 10914.18]  done this a lot of times i don't have super sensitive skin on my scalp so if i just put it in like shampoo
[10914.98 --> 10920.10]  do the heat thing but why did you tell me the avoid scalp thing you're gonna have to watch it
[10920.10 --> 10924.42]  back i think you were very focused on what you were doing oh yeah we're not listening he said to
[10924.42 --> 10930.66]  absolutely hit the scalp i was focusing the camera and i remember that instruction but you can't you
[10930.66 --> 10934.58]  should you should know from teaching people that are new at things you don't say the part that they're
[10934.58 --> 10938.50]  not supposed to do then you shouldn't say avoid the scalp but you know on mine you can go for it
[10938.50 --> 10943.70]  because then they're still going to hesitate that's a very like beginner teacher thing that you should
[10943.70 --> 10951.86]  know okay i gotta say i look sassier like this yeah i like it i don't know if i agree i don't think
[10951.86 --> 10961.46]  you look sad it makes it more biting serious no no he looks like he's uh violent violent the orange does
[10961.46 --> 10965.54]  help with that a little bit if it was actually pure blonde i don't think so no but he looks a little
[10965.54 --> 10972.18]  insane looks like he's had some problems yeah like look at that face like he's just gonna stab you
[10972.18 --> 10979.38]  let me look at the face we didn't change anything about the face yeah but like the face no uh all
[10979.38 --> 10987.54]  right hit me dan uh sure i might have to get you guys to read them yourself okay anonymous says hey lld
[10988.18 --> 10995.30]  sweet sweet sour lime day deals linus badminton talk what's your racket and string combo in your play style
[10995.30 --> 11002.10]  uh i play with the nano flare 700 for you i like to smash a lot but more of like uh more of an
[11002.10 --> 11010.10]  accuracy focus smash rather than a super hard smash thank you i saw that um i uh i have good defense but
[11010.10 --> 11017.94]  my my my light touch could use a lot of improvement richard says it's 2024 how come we don't have
[11017.94 --> 11025.06]  individually addressable sprinkler heads in our irrigation systems yet i mean that can be done but i i i
[11025.06 --> 11034.42]  i would counter your question with my own question why is individual room hvac not completely normal
[11034.42 --> 11040.42]  now yeah because it's been a thing but when i got quoted to do the ac system at my old place they
[11040.42 --> 11046.50]  quoted me like 20 something thousand dollars and it was just like one thermostat in one place it's so bad
[11046.50 --> 11049.30]  which is so stupid
[11051.46 --> 11056.02]  setting up a system where you can have where you can have um
[11057.78 --> 11064.74]  oh not that baffles the things the things in the ducts man why is this word escaping from me right now
[11064.74 --> 11070.26]  i've turned into a blonde now i know how you feel not really it's more orange
[11070.26 --> 11080.42]  um dampers louvers whatever yeah dampers dampers so i think that's what we call them here um so like
[11080.42 --> 11085.46]  why wouldn't you just have damper control on a per room basis so you can dump cold into it or not
[11085.46 --> 11089.62]  dump cold how do these not communicate back how's that not it's like a little bit of wire and a tiny
[11089.62 --> 11098.18]  motor like for the cost of these hvac installations it seems so obvious like everyone can relate to this
[11098.18 --> 11105.78]  like being in at work and like person a's office is always freezing and person b's office is always
[11105.78 --> 11112.50]  boiling why is this not obvious and then when i did it myself i did it with mini splits rather than
[11112.50 --> 11118.74]  with ducted central ac and that just had per room control built into it not and it was a fraction of
[11118.74 --> 11125.14]  the price i'm sitting here going why is anybody doing anything other than this i it's so obvious it
[11125.14 --> 11130.66]  seems genuinely very weird yeah i don't want to ac my whole house i'm i'm sleeping in one room
[11131.78 --> 11137.30]  it just i don't know maybe it's just like a silly like north america if we can you know we'll just make
[11137.30 --> 11144.34]  a bigger ac and cool the whole thing like i i don't know what it is but i'm yeah individual control of
[11144.34 --> 11150.50]  things seems like like it should just be especially where the cost is so low it just seems like a thing
[11150.50 --> 11160.82]  that we should we should do more um all right what else we got here uh joseph v says full kit for
[11160.82 --> 11167.78]  myself the new wife and our cat what old you get oh drop out scoop brawl that bunch of stuff luke and
[11167.78 --> 11174.18]  linus as newlyweds we'd love to know some of the hilarious quirks about your sos that were unexpected
[11174.18 --> 11181.62]  adjustments so yvonne and i lived together in her parents house for at least a couple of years
[11181.62 --> 11187.06]  before we moved in together so there wasn't really anything unexpected but one of the ones that drove me
[11187.70 --> 11194.34]  crazy and that to her credit i don't know how she did this because old habits are hard to break she
[11195.14 --> 11201.78]  corrected for me is she had a habit of using approximately correct words
[11201.78 --> 11211.62]  words so she would say put it on the floor when she was talking about the ground or she'd say
[11211.62 --> 11217.86]  i left it on the table when she was talking about the counter now english is not yvonne's first language
[11217.86 --> 11223.06]  even though she speaks it as well or better than the vast majority of the native speakers that i've ever
[11223.06 --> 11232.74]  met but so so so so so that combined with the fact that she grew up in a non-english first household
[11232.74 --> 11239.38]  means that there were some idiosyncrasies to her communication that make a very literal person like me
[11240.58 --> 11247.78]  very frustrated because i and and that's something i've worked on too when she says check the counter i
[11247.78 --> 11254.58]  know to look at any horizontal surface now but i didn't back then and so she would say i left it on
[11254.58 --> 11258.18]  the counter i would go look on the counter it wouldn't be there i would truck all the way back
[11258.18 --> 11262.82]  to where she is i'd be like it's not there and she'd come back up with me and it would be on the
[11262.82 --> 11266.98]  table i'd be like she's like look there it is i'm like yeah that's the table i didn't i didn't look at
[11266.98 --> 11272.26]  the that's not where you told me it was um so that that took some adjustment that's something we worked
[11272.26 --> 11282.50]  together on i'm good fair enough uh next up hayley says hey linus i know you don't like presents do
[11282.50 --> 11288.50]  you like cards oh sorry and just to address some of the comments no i'm not abstaining because they're
[11288.50 --> 11294.66]  so bad or something i'm abstaining because i just i don't feel like it he's hungry he's cranky
[11295.78 --> 11300.58]  and then he'll want answered merch messages later well no just not that one i'm not gonna like drop
[11300.58 --> 11305.30]  dig on my on my partner i don't i don't feel like i need to oh so you're saying i'm a bad person
[11305.30 --> 11310.74]  no i think that one i get it because you know i get it you gave the uh english not first language
[11310.74 --> 11315.70]  thing and and there's some like she can speak really well but there's some translation oddities
[11315.70 --> 11319.94]  between languages that might make things like kind of weird whatever i got one here for you
[11320.50 --> 11322.98]  hey there goldie twink and the two bears um
[11322.98 --> 11332.82]  thank you so much that is so uncomfortable for so many reasons
[11337.46 --> 11343.70]  looks all right sorry uh apart from bleach blonde what's the worst hairstyle each of you ever had
[11343.70 --> 11350.18]  oh yeah i can head this one up i probably had the worst between both of us which is quite a feat given
[11350.18 --> 11354.66]  some of the hairstyles linus has had that a lot of the audience has even actually seen um
[11355.78 --> 11362.82]  i used to go to uvic and those were some blender years if any but um at one point in time i went to
[11362.82 --> 11368.66]  this barber shop downtown victoria and just told them to you know i don't know do whatever i just need
[11368.66 --> 11375.70]  a haircut um and the guy like joked with me about how like you know you should probably pick something
[11375.70 --> 11380.58]  and i was like no and he's like well we do some like pretty crazy stuff and i'm like really not
[11380.58 --> 11384.98]  paying attention because i like actually don't care because this is what i've done all the time and i
[11384.98 --> 11389.54]  end up just getting like very normal haircuts so who cares right yeah i'm more specific now um
[11390.42 --> 11395.46]  he did carving it was a barber shop where they do carving at least that's what they called it then
[11395.46 --> 11400.50]  i'm sure they call it something else now um but i had waves on the side of my head and then a star on the back
[11400.50 --> 11408.98]  and then i had to go to my my girlfriend at the time's prom because she was one grade below me
[11408.98 --> 11414.58]  this was my first year in university and i it was mostly grown up but you could still see it
[11415.22 --> 11420.42]  oh let me ask this how much was that haircut not very much at all okay then that was a really cheap
[11420.42 --> 11425.70]  lesson yeah i'm pretty sure he didn't upcharge me for like the carving stuff like he would normally
[11425.70 --> 11432.50]  um and yeah it was like i lived in dorms at the time so it was like a joke for a while
[11433.06 --> 11438.98]  and then my hair grew back and it was fine um so yeah any any crazy hair color that you may have done
[11438.98 --> 11443.86]  when you were younger at least you didn't have a star cut into your head yeah you win yeah you just
[11443.86 --> 11450.50]  automatically win yeah so you looked like a college student dating a high schooler um sure we were
[11450.50 --> 11457.54]  we didn't look like it get over it um yeah i mean i've done a lot of colors and i've had a lot of
[11457.54 --> 11463.94]  like you know kind of not very trendy hairstyles i guess um but i can't say that i've ever done that
[11464.98 --> 11465.70]  so that's cool
[11468.74 --> 11475.78]  i win how did you not notice well you started okay and you were just like well what do you do now
[11475.78 --> 11484.18]  tell them to keep going yeah whatever like i i thought it would be better to just like embrace
[11484.18 --> 11490.26]  it at that point um and then be like okay i have this like big line in the side of my head or something
[11490.82 --> 11497.22]  um i don't know it ended up being like kind of funny i don't know i didn't really care i was obviously
[11497.22 --> 11501.94]  never going to do it again but like it didn't it didn't ruin my life or anything like it whatever
[11501.94 --> 11508.34]  i didn't it didn't actually like i was happy when my hair grew out and it was gone at least she still
[11508.34 --> 11513.38]  took you to the problem with her yeah yeah i don't know how happy she was about it but it also didn't
[11513.38 --> 11518.10]  really show up in photos and stuff because like the big bit was on the back nice so like yeah
[11521.38 --> 11528.90]  did the star look good i mean i mean did you ever see it not not directly like pictures and stuff um
[11528.90 --> 11536.10]  um it it was a star on the back of my head so like by default no um but like were the lines clean
[11536.10 --> 11546.26]  and stuff like yeah he did a good job yeah okay let's see what else we got here you answered the
[11546.26 --> 11551.70]  cards one right maybe i don't know uh no i didn't answer the cards one what was it linus you don't like
[11551.70 --> 11558.82]  presents but are you okay with getting cards yeah sure i like graphics cards network cards storage cards
[11558.90 --> 11564.74]  i'm gonna get you a 1080 to frame on your wall uh no i think cards are a waste of paper
[11565.30 --> 11573.54]  and e-cards are a waste of time man what about an nft remember e-cards i had quite genuinely
[11573.54 --> 11580.10]  forgotten probably for years until you just mentioned it that was a relatively short but that was quite
[11580.10 --> 11587.54]  a phase of the internet yeah wow just send me a text that's all that's yeah if you must like
[11587.54 --> 11593.14]  congratulate me on making it around the sun again i like sending my friends uh just birth
[11594.10 --> 11596.10]  just the word yeah
[11598.66 --> 11600.66]  it feels a little less contrived
[11600.66 --> 11609.86]  um yeah let's see let's see uh wet noodle says grandparents send me e-cards oh wait hold on
[11609.86 --> 11615.30]  oh wet noodle says grandparents still send e-cards to this day treasure it someday they won't
[11618.66 --> 11623.30]  linus would you be willing to ever make an appearance at a land type convention like quake con
[11623.30 --> 11639.38]  we kind of do our own right uh yeah i did um fragapalooza a thousand years ago i met fps doug we
[11639.38 --> 11646.10]  both that's cool i remember that's how you got your poster signed yep um we both separately because
[11646.10 --> 11651.70]  before we met used to go to local lands all the time yep 100 but there isn't really any local
[11651.70 --> 11658.58]  lands anymore except for ours i don't know it's like um that'd be cool it'd be fun i like going to
[11658.58 --> 11666.90]  lands but um these days if i'm gonna go to one it's gonna be like one that we throw so i i probably
[11666.90 --> 11675.46]  wouldn't like travel for it i don't know it's tough it's tough uh no i'm not planning to go to pax west
[11675.46 --> 11681.62]  i'm not the biggest i'm not the biggest pax guy luke was a big i was pax guy it's not as good
[11681.62 --> 11690.26]  anymore it's not the same thing yeah okay let's see here sorry i was chewing another thing i'll say
[11690.26 --> 11700.26]  about lands is modern lands uh really need good administration of the people um a lot of modern
[11700.26 --> 11708.50]  like like the pax west land used to be really fun and now it sucks um largely because everyone's just like
[11708.50 --> 11712.74]  sitting on social media or watching youtube or doing something like there's no
[11715.06 --> 11719.46]  they're not land partying they're sitting at their computer it's a totally different thing
[11719.46 --> 11727.38]  um and there's actually a pretty serious amount of trying to make sure everyone's engaged in doing
[11727.38 --> 11731.78]  things that happen at our lands well i remember you talking to me about this how you felt like
[11731.78 --> 11740.02]  over time a lot of the byoc seats at pax turned into a place for people to stash their stuff yeah
[11740.02 --> 11745.06]  rather than a place for them to hang out all day and play video games yeah totally that's that's
[11745.06 --> 11752.02]  absolutely a thing um people started prioritizing the the show more but that that was like a self-fulfilling
[11752.02 --> 11758.02]  prophecy because once some people started doing it it impacted the quality of the land which made other
[11758.02 --> 11762.98]  people less interested in the land so they started doing it and then that just kind of kept looping
[11762.98 --> 11767.06]  and it turned into a thing where like no one was really landing during the day and then even after
[11767.06 --> 11773.38]  the expo hall closed people were still just using it as like mostly a crash pad or or a place to sit
[11773.38 --> 11779.06]  at their computer instead of really focusing on playing games early packs lands were sick i think
[11779.06 --> 11784.26]  there was also some form of administration change like the the people or the person that was running it
[11784.26 --> 11790.18]  early on stopped and wasn't running it later on and i think that had a significant impact as well
[11790.18 --> 11794.98]  um but yeah it's it's not really that great anymore okay to be fair i never went over co but i haven't
[11794.98 --> 11798.26]  been in technically since 2019. number between two and four
[11800.90 --> 11801.86]  that is a tough one
[11806.10 --> 11810.58]  four you know you're just delaying the best deals

[11909.06 --> 11915.22]  i have not played around with education tech really very much like you got to understand when i was in
[11915.22 --> 11920.82]  high school they still used overhead projectors to teach math like i have almost no experience with
[11920.82 --> 11924.42]  smart whiteboards i was trying to figure out how they wrote this because it was like tech you have
[11924.42 --> 11930.98]  tinkered with for education so is that education tech or is that tech that you tinkered with for learning
[11930.98 --> 11931.62]  specifically
[11935.54 --> 11943.30]  i assumed it was tech for education i mean you know data projectors have gotten a lot more affordable and a lot

[12006.26 --> 12011.22]  whoever set up this talk um all right dan we got a couple more actually wrong merch message yeah the
[12011.22 --> 12018.42]  doc's wrong the doc says uh 49.99 discount 50 that's okay we threw this together at the last second i don't
[12018.42 --> 12027.22]  blame anybody but yeah it's uh it's 59.99 sorry sorry will you guys ever do throwback merch um i got some of the
[12027.22 --> 12032.34]  holographic keyboard t-shirts at one point but they were damaged in a water leak and i'd love to get
[12032.34 --> 12039.22]  some replacements uh we've thought about it but i don't know we tend to be more of a like move forward
[12039.22 --> 12045.62]  instead of move back kind of mentality place here nothing's impossible but i don't think we have any
[12045.62 --> 12054.18]  specific plans right now i've been waiting for sweatpants and hoodies to go on sale i've been
[12054.18 --> 12060.50]  taking advantage of the lime day sales all week my question is what do you think the future of amd's
[12060.50 --> 12061.54]  x3d chips are
[12061.54 --> 12076.26]  x3d is super cool i um looking back i don't remember a time when cash was so important to
[12076.26 --> 12081.62]  gaming yeah like i i've never been able to find it again but i did this really cool video um or not
[12081.62 --> 12088.58]  video um article on hardware canucks back in the core 2 duo core 2 quad era where there was a pentium chip
[12088.58 --> 12100.50]  a um a celeron chip a core like core branded chip and then like something else an extreme or something
[12100.50 --> 12104.82]  and the only difference between all of them they all had the same core count and they all had the
[12104.82 --> 12109.70]  same clock speed the only difference between all of them it was either three or four chips i seriously
[12109.70 --> 12114.74]  can't remember uh but the only difference was the cash amount and i basically was like okay
[12114.74 --> 12122.02]  we keep getting told more cash more cash is more better how much does it matter for gamers and i
[12122.02 --> 12129.30]  specifically benchmarked games and what i found was that shockingly even the lowly celeron
[12130.58 --> 12137.94]  at this with the same constraints at the same core count at the same clock speed almost kept up it didn't
[12138.58 --> 12143.62]  you know the i think the the happy medium was actually the like like pentium dual core or whatever it was
[12143.62 --> 12149.78]  um but i i was shocked at how little it mattered past a certain point so when amd first pitched x3
[12150.34 --> 12156.10]  with that very limited outdated data set i was like oh well i wonder if everything's the same and they
[12156.10 --> 12159.86]  just add a bunch more cash if this is really going to make a material difference for gamers and as it
[12159.86 --> 12167.78]  turned out it definitely did zen is super super sensitive to uh data access latency and adding a
[12167.78 --> 12172.98]  hunk ton of cash to it makes a big big difference um especially in certain workloads like gaming so
[12173.94 --> 12180.74]  i don't see x3d going anywhere anytime soon it's obvious that it's really challenging for amd to
[12180.74 --> 12187.94]  build i mean we saw this in the uh in the way that they kind of baby these x3d chips in terms of the
[12187.94 --> 12193.14]  amount of voltage they're willing to put through them but hey at least they uh at least they're doing
[12193.14 --> 12201.70]  that instead of them dying in the field so that's cool rough aside from terry fox what is something
[12201.70 --> 12207.46]  about canada you think is underrated that should be embraced as a source of pride and or patriotism
[12209.78 --> 12215.70]  i legitimately thought that about tim portens at one point in time oh don't remind me it's been a
[12215.70 --> 12222.18]  long time frozen donuts i think that tim hortons blows so many chunks it's so bad now i'm proud of
[12222.18 --> 12228.74]  duffin's donuts duffin's donuts that gives me pride at least in vancouver i don't even i don't even know
[12228.74 --> 12236.02]  like what's uh what's cool about canada we're tree yeah we got rocks and trees and trees and rocks and
[12236.02 --> 12242.50]  rocks and trees and trees and rocks and rocks but also we just trees and rocks ship them to china
[12242.50 --> 12250.58]  and then buy back sand trees and trees and rocks and water which is good that's a that's a real song
[12250.58 --> 12256.90]  by the way that is actually a real song by the arrogant worms great and proud canadians um i used
[12256.90 --> 12264.10]  to like canada more i think canada had more of a its own culture before and i think it has less of its
[12264.10 --> 12277.86]  own culture now i think that's not great um yeah i don't know it's pretty yeah it's pretty
[12279.86 --> 12286.66]  somewhere some places i don't know i think um this is probably a super confusing thing for like
[12286.66 --> 12293.22]  some people from other places to watch i know that uh you know in america in particular um we took our
[12293.22 --> 12299.14]  kids on a trip down to washington state and they were a little confused that there were like american
[12299.14 --> 12305.06]  flags everywhere and we're like is that like normal like what what's the deal with that and we're like
[12305.06 --> 12314.50]  oh yeah just like americans are like hyper patriotic and stuff um and we i think don't get that beaten
[12314.50 --> 12319.78]  into us quite as hard and so it's probably a little confusing for people from other places to watch us kind
[12319.78 --> 12326.10]  of struggling to think of something that we're proud of canada for um it's not because we like
[12326.10 --> 12333.06]  hate canada you also put up terry fox yeah um you're trying to you we're trying to find something
[12333.06 --> 12336.98]  that's on the level of terry fox yeah if you ask a canadian for something that they're proud about
[12336.98 --> 12341.86]  that's on the level of terry fox they're probably going to struggle um yeah it's like we don't we don't
[12341.86 --> 12352.74]  hate canada we obviously either of us could leave anytime we want so to be fair yeah if it wasn't for
[12352.74 --> 12359.46]  this i'd be gone that's no that's true i wouldn't well thinking
[12362.02 --> 12366.90]  no well i don't know a lot of the reasons that i would stay are not necessarily anything to do with
[12366.90 --> 12371.54]  canada anyway and to be fair i wouldn't be gone because i like notably dislike canada i actually like
[12371.54 --> 12377.86]  canada for a amount um he just likes it's just the nordic countries better certain other places
[12377.86 --> 12386.82]  that i like a little bit more um yeah but canada is cool it's just i think it doesn't get televised
[12386.82 --> 12392.82]  as much but canada has been really going through some stuff lately um what what gets the views on the
[12392.82 --> 12400.34]  interwebs wherever you're from practically as far as i can tell is american politics and i think canadian
[12400.34 --> 12405.62]  politics are even less interesting because we're so physically close to america that it's just it
[12405.62 --> 12410.02]  just seems like america light to a lot of other people but we're we're like actually really going
[12410.02 --> 12417.70]  through it right now um financially canada is doing really poorly right now um so much of our
[12418.58 --> 12427.22]  like gdp is just increases in land value yep which has been just ripping the population apart because
[12427.22 --> 12431.78]  no one can afford housing and people are genuinely seriously questioning how they're going to live
[12431.78 --> 12437.38]  literally anywhere in this enormous country because it can't afford to live anywhere and there's all
[12437.38 --> 12442.90]  this incentive to not build enough housing and and crank immigration like crazy so that the the housing
[12442.90 --> 12449.62]  prices keep going up no matter what and just like yep it's um yeah a lot of the things that we were known
[12449.62 --> 12455.54]  for and we were kind of good at we don't even really do anymore um or it's not as much of a focus it's uh
[12456.10 --> 12460.98]  vancouver which is close to where we live is like literally one of the most corrupt places in all of
[12460.98 --> 12468.18]  north america um that's been reported on pretty extensively but like money laundering and criminal
[12468.18 --> 12476.50]  finance is like realistically probably the main export of vancouver um racism is becoming crazy in
[12476.50 --> 12480.98]  canada right now i would say that it's probably growing more than i've ever seen it before there's
[12480.98 --> 12485.86]  like wasn't a thing when i was a kid and it's becoming a thing there's a casino in coquitlam
[12486.82 --> 12493.14]  in the middle of absolutely nowhere it's in an industrial zone they made exceptions for it to be
[12493.14 --> 12498.90]  there for who knows why some reason and as far as i can tell it exists only for money laundering yeah
[12499.54 --> 12504.82]  like it's not an entertainment hub it's not it's just like it's just like easy access on the freeway it's
[12504.82 --> 12512.02]  the only reason that anything like that would be there yeah so it's like i don't know there's uh
[12512.02 --> 12516.82]  i i understand it's it seems like kind of the whole world's going through it right now see if name says
[12516.82 --> 12520.74]  it's a terrible casino as well but that's not the point the point is just that you can launder money
[12520.74 --> 12527.38]  there yeah yeah nothing nothing else matters yeah i get everyone's going through it i'm not trying to
[12527.38 --> 12532.58]  say it's necessarily worse here than elsewhere we're just very much going through the whole world's kind
[12532.58 --> 12538.18]  of going through it that's what i'm saying if we're being honest right like and there's a lot of
[12538.18 --> 12547.22]  um there's a lot of pessimism um and you know i'm i i i'm not a i'm not a huge fan at this point of like
[12547.22 --> 12554.82]  taking sides in an election um what's what's the point right um but what i will say is that there's a
[12554.82 --> 12561.86]  lot of problems with every option for our upcoming election yeah and i think that there's a lot of our
[12561.86 --> 12568.50]  there's a lot of fine folks down south that can probably relate to that um a little bit i have
[12568.50 --> 12574.82]  i have never been less interested in an election than the one we're currently going through and not
[12574.82 --> 12579.70]  because i think the answer is going to matter it's because i've never seen an election where both sides
[12579.70 --> 12590.34]  were so flawed yeah and it's like cool okay so i'm like voting for lesser evil but the lesser evil is
[12590.34 --> 12599.62]  like really bad so cool like i don't know it just it feel it it it feels kind of tough and i say all
[12599.62 --> 12604.18]  this while like i'm pretty sure last show i was talking about how i i've been trying to actively like
[12604.18 --> 12608.02]  avoid negativity spaces on the internet and stuff so i'm not trying to i'm not trying to do that but
[12608.02 --> 12618.34]  i'm just trying to be real like it's it's rough right now um i i think the um always online nature
[12618.34 --> 12622.66]  of modern life is really really really bad for people and i think that we're starting to feel that
[12623.22 --> 12629.62]  um in in places that aren't even just online now i think just the general negativity of like everyone
[12629.62 --> 12634.42]  is is partially that partially other things i don't know but it is what it is you know this show was
[12634.42 --> 12641.30]  kind of an upper until now yeah we shouldn't feed you on the show because clearly you just you're you're
[12641.30 --> 12646.18]  you're a downer luke low blood sugar is happy luke apparently
[12649.94 --> 12654.74]  it's idea it's because he's not getting his chicken and rice it's like oh this doesn't have
[12654.74 --> 12660.42]  this doesn't have four thousand bottles of red frank's hot sauce of sando my body has to deal with
[12660.42 --> 12666.58]  economy is terrible foreign thing it is never dealt with this type of food yeah it's only ever chicken
[12666.58 --> 12672.66]  rice what is noodles it has a spice in it um i don't know why i imagined you're just eating boiled
[12672.66 --> 12678.26]  rice and boiled chicken why the devil mr besser are there still so many curated merch messages i thought
[12678.26 --> 12685.94]  we were oh well when we did the dying thing i got another 200 merch messages if you want if you want
[12685.94 --> 12694.26]  to have a look at the stats page i see um well okay cool i'm gonna do the last lightning deal then
[12694.26 --> 12700.74]  okay i'll give it here i'll give a no never mind there's actually a lame ending i won't do it
[12701.86 --> 12707.78]  all right well i'm gonna make sure that the deal is what it says in my sheet first and then i'm gonna
[12708.42 --> 12714.02]  i'll set it live oh this one's pretty good okay yeah we have a few hundred of these but these are
[12714.02 --> 12716.66]  gonna go fast mystery hoodies
[12720.18 --> 12730.82]  9.99 whoa guys please for the love of all that is good if in in the name of whatever it is that you
[12730.82 --> 12736.90]  believe in please put something profitable in the cart with these mystery hoodies um fill it up
[12736.90 --> 12746.18]  100 bucks uh gets you free shipping for your order uh do it mystery hoodies 9.99 i'm fine i just i'm not
[12746.18 --> 12752.98]  acting i just actually don't get it oh it's like so far below cost it's crazy that's okay they're gonna
[12752.98 --> 12757.62]  they're gonna help me out are they they're gonna buy something else at the same time but like you
[12757.62 --> 12762.98]  didn't have to go so hard quite genuine i know that's like a line but like i don't even mean it that
[12762.98 --> 12768.42]  way you just didn't i know if it was five dollars more i literally think nothing would have changed i
[12768.42 --> 12776.10]  literally intervened on this one to make it lower to make it stupid why what can i say i'm a fan of
[12776.10 --> 12785.30]  the black eyed peas we're gonna get it started the boots with the fur we didn't know we didn't
[12785.30 --> 12793.30]  everybody was looking at her get us out of here again apple bar jesus turn the car off
[12795.30 --> 12802.90]  you're locked in here with us luke uh let's see uh jesus this is a real job that i have looking
[12803.62 --> 12808.02]  looking back over the amazing content that you have created not this show what is something you wish you
[12808.02 --> 12816.34]  could redo now that uh you have some notoriety and how would you do it to be different
[12818.10 --> 12823.70]  okay let's try that again unless you got what i was saying no i uh no i got it i got it i uh
[12824.34 --> 12830.02]  i don't know i i again back to the looking forward not looking back i i think um we're there's
[12830.02 --> 12834.98]  definitely things that we could have done differently with a bit more planning or you know what oh no i i
[12834.98 --> 12840.58]  lied nerd sports i'd redo nerd sports really channel super fun yeah what would you change or
[12840.58 --> 12844.98]  you just want to do it again i i think it would be a blast to do again for one thing but i would
[12844.98 --> 12848.18]  change i would make the i would make it more structured i'd make it more like a show more
[12848.18 --> 12853.54]  like my original vision for it okay so like uh like an external host more that's like inflicting
[12853.54 --> 12858.82]  things instead of like you hosting it and playing at the same time yeah and just and the and the episode
[12858.82 --> 12863.62]  format being more clearly defined from one to the next it was supposed to be and it just
[12863.62 --> 12869.38]  i'm i'm not going to blame any one person it was a big challenge and we were a very small team um
[12870.02 --> 12874.58]  but i think it could have been a lot better nerd sports 2 would be sick and i think all of those
[12874.58 --> 12878.74]  are out of stock now says flipping chat yeah i'm not surprised what
[12878.74 --> 12888.90]  what
[12892.90 --> 12893.70]  he's speechless
[12898.10 --> 12899.78]  what's going on i'm scared
[12899.78 --> 12906.90]  huh okay we probably didn't have to go quite that hard
[12911.06 --> 12912.50]  please tell me you guys bought other things
[12914.82 --> 12919.54]  no they were moving too fast did you get because they had to race everyone else because the deal was
[12919.54 --> 12924.82]  so insane there's people in chat that are saying no right now and also there's someone in chat that
[12924.82 --> 12928.34]  was like yeah i couldn't even get through the checkout process and they only tried to buy the
[12928.34 --> 12936.74]  the hoodie it was too cheap yeah this guy just uh this is just a hoodie yeah i'm gonna send a mean
[12936.74 --> 12944.10]  response no nice do it will the keyboard pins ever come back why didn't you buy
[12944.10 --> 12950.10]  something else yeah yeah
[12955.54 --> 12960.26]  we're gonna be like one of those restaurants where like the shtick is that the the servers are rude
[12960.26 --> 12965.94]  to you yeah yeah just all of dan's replies now are like why did you buy more i need to keep working
[12965.94 --> 12968.18]  here you're gonna get us all
[12971.86 --> 12974.02]  oh no why oh man
[12976.10 --> 12980.18]  uh i gotta keep asking these i think uh let's see
[12981.86 --> 12989.30]  uh hey dll i work in the motion picture industry do you think generative ii will be as big a
[12989.30 --> 12995.30]  disruption to the industry as a lot of my co-workers think or do you see being like the advent
[12995.30 --> 12996.26]  of cgi
[12999.86 --> 13005.94]  i think it's going to be pretty disruptive i think that if you look at the very like cutting edge
[13005.94 --> 13011.30]  original content that's coming out of hollywood right now like i'm going to point at something
[13011.30 --> 13015.70]  like barbenheimer is something that clearly was different from what came before that subverted
[13015.70 --> 13023.38]  expectations uh the barbie movie in particular turned my expectations for what a corporate sellout movie
[13023.38 --> 13032.34]  could be on their heads um 100 percent that is never going to be ai there might be a little
[13032.34 --> 13040.42]  bit of inspiration and ai could be a tool for facilitating more out there ideas potentially
[13040.42 --> 13047.54]  um but the execution it's just it's such a tight package that's that's it's so original it's never
[13047.54 --> 13057.86]  going to be ai however the like just generic uh just filler material catalog filler material your
[13057.86 --> 13061.94]  hallmark movies your catalog filler material on platforms like netflix
[13061.94 --> 13071.38]  marvel stuff that's debatable that's still it's not always done well but i think there's a high
[13071.38 --> 13076.74]  degree of handcraftedness to marvel stories um especially the ones that have i don't mean
[13076.74 --> 13080.18]  the whole thing at all i mean like as a form of contribution
[13080.18 --> 13089.54]  i'm i'm thinking more like you're like your whole film written or done by it not written you're you're
[13089.54 --> 13096.58]  you're you're 25 rotten tomatoes like rom-coms right like that's that's what i'm talking about
[13096.58 --> 13102.26]  all of the hallmark films ever yeah though those are the ones that i really do see ai
[13102.26 --> 13111.94]  significantly um replacing writing on and like no disrespect to the writers i suspect it's a it's a
[13111.94 --> 13116.10]  budgetary constraint as much as anything a lot of the time i think it's further out than people think
[13116.10 --> 13123.62]  though i i've yeah i think people massively discounted the hallucination issue early on
[13123.62 --> 13127.54]  and thought things were going to be here like right away but the hallucination issue was a huge deal
[13127.54 --> 13135.22]  and it's still a huge deal and i don't know how much better it's gotten um emma and i might my
[13135.22 --> 13142.98]  my partner have been playing the new york times games recently um i don't pay for it you get a free
[13142.98 --> 13149.22]  game of each version every day so we play like wordle and connections and uh i'm not gonna remember
[13149.22 --> 13155.14]  the name of them but there's one game where there's what is it 12 letters there's three on each side of
[13155.14 --> 13161.38]  like a square and you have to make words out of the letters um actually i'll just bring it up give me a
[13161.38 --> 13168.18]  second uh new york time games it would be a lot easier if i just showed you
[13168.18 --> 13186.74]  almost there i don't know if we have a way of doing this but i can't i i will say in advance that
[13186.74 --> 13192.66]  if we dig in and if there's a way to do this and people i saw oh i don't know if we have a way to do
[13192.66 --> 13199.22]  this but i will say this up front here um if we dig in and you're muted apparently i unmuted and
[13199.22 --> 13203.62]  there's a lot of people who did this and we have a way to manually undo it if people ordered like 10
[13203.62 --> 13209.14]  of those mystery hoodies we're gonna manually go in and change it to just one don't be a dick um
[13210.34 --> 13214.90]  so i saw a couple people kind of talking about that in the chat so i'm gonna have a conversation
[13214.90 --> 13220.50]  with nick about that next week cool that's a good call okay like that's just not it's not cool you
[13220.50 --> 13227.38]  know like yeah you technically can but um like if people if like literally 10 people just went in there
[13227.38 --> 13234.74]  and you know bought 40 hoodies each that's uh that's not cool yeah okay um so this is the game it's called
[13234.74 --> 13245.14]  letterboxed um you you have to spell words using help this box so we'll do h e oh no you can't okay
[13245.14 --> 13249.30]  so part of the game and i think this is a big part of the reason why it has oh sorry there's a p in
[13249.30 --> 13258.66]  there too i'm sorry i wasn't even watching um no just kidding uh is that you have to use uh a different
[13258.66 --> 13264.10]  side every time so you could never have like a repeat letter in a word because i couldn't pick
[13264.10 --> 13269.78]  l twice for example um and you have to try to spell uh you have to solve see it says try to
[13269.78 --> 13273.46]  solve in four words sometimes it's five words sometimes it's six words but you have to try to
[13273.46 --> 13279.38]  solve so you have to touch each letter yeah i get it to solve it um and you have to try to solve it in
[13279.38 --> 13286.50]  as few words as possible um we were having we always try to beat the amount that it says to do it
[13286.50 --> 13291.38]  in so try to solve in four words and we'll try to do it in three or something right sure um there was
[13291.38 --> 13295.70]  one that we were doing that was like try to solve in six words and i think we got it in four and we
[13295.70 --> 13302.98]  were trying to see if we could do it in three but we were really struggling yeah um and screen oh people
[13302.98 --> 13308.66]  are trying to tell me to do it i'm not going to do the whole puzzle right now um so what i did was i
[13308.66 --> 13315.06]  used open ai's because normally we don't use external tools but i was wondering like okay are we just not
[13315.06 --> 13321.14]  good enough could like uh could could an ai do this for us so i you i screenshot it and i copy and
[13321.14 --> 13325.30]  paste it because if you click under the question mark you can get the exact rules for the game
[13325.30 --> 13330.42]  so i copy and pasted the exact rules for the game uh pasted that in through text and then i screenshot
[13330.42 --> 13338.34]  the square that we had and i asked it to solve it and i could not no matter what make it do it no matter
[13338.34 --> 13343.70]  what i did i i it would it would like pick letters from the same side repeatedly and i would tell it that
[13343.70 --> 13347.70]  that it did that and it would be like oh sorry here's your solve and then it wouldn't actually
[13347.70 --> 13353.06]  solve for all the letters it would leave out like half of them um it just i would constantly tell it
[13353.06 --> 13356.66]  like no you broke this rule you broke this rule you broke this rule you broke this rule blah blah blah
[13356.66 --> 13362.18]  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and it just would never work i could not get it to do it
[13362.18 --> 13366.66]  um so like it's cool that it can pass the bar and stuff but it still can't do everything you know
[13366.66 --> 13376.82]  um so it's it's both further than i think a lot of people think and not nearly as far as a lot of
[13376.82 --> 13381.94]  people think um it has a lot of issues still and it has a lot of issues that are gonna be extremely
[13381.94 --> 13388.50]  difficult to solve and take some serious time um but then there is an incredible amount of investment
[13388.50 --> 13394.66]  that's going into it and i do think these problems are eventually solvable so we'll see yeah
[13394.66 --> 13402.98]  linus do you ever consider how many people whose lives have changed by interacting with your content
[13404.34 --> 13411.22]  um it's easy to lose track you know we get our head down in the work and we get focused um
[13412.18 --> 13418.10]  but adam actually sent me one sent me one today he sent me an email today a nice reminder of the
[13418.10 --> 13423.30]  positive impact we can have and i'm gonna anonymize this obviously a little bit so i'm gonna change it a
[13423.30 --> 13429.38]  bit so this person cannot be identified but someone just um sent them a message sent adam a message
[13429.94 --> 13437.78]  and said um i was watching your setup doctor video and absolutely loved it it also moved me quite a bit
[13437.78 --> 13442.66]  it was genuinely relaxing to see the before and after shots of all the setups it made me reflect on
[13442.66 --> 13447.46]  the state i've kept my own pc setup in over the years i've only recently realized i was struggling with
[13447.46 --> 13453.06]  depression uh part of me part of trying to grow past it was to reclaim my pc setup so i can feel
[13453.06 --> 13458.42]  comfortable again just wanted to thank you for doing this video it uh absolutely made my day and
[13458.42 --> 13463.86]  it's like you never know what is meaningful to someone right you never know what someone's going
[13463.86 --> 13469.14]  through and i guess if you throw enough pieces of spaghetti at the wall eventually something's gonna
[13469.14 --> 13478.82]  stick for somebody right and i thought that was really cool hello dll linus what brand and type of
[13478.82 --> 13483.62]  paint do you recommend for painting base boyards trims and walls any painting tips for somebody new to
[13483.62 --> 13494.58]  painting uh just get these a lot interior get semi-gloss um you know yeah i i like cloverdale paint but
[13494.58 --> 13498.50]  that's just because i have experience with them i think it's a good quality product uh it's a local
[13499.22 --> 13503.54]  local chain obviously so you probably won't be able to buy it but uh get wrecked they're great good
[13503.54 --> 13509.46]  luck with that i wouldn't like travel here to shop there yeah not worth it but they are cool i've been
[13509.46 --> 13511.86]  there too not eggshell semi-gloss for trim
[13514.50 --> 13521.86]  hi i've been watching since luke was slick you've said in the past setting up a warehouse overseas is
[13521.86 --> 13529.62]  complex why don't you partner with local distributors uh p.s why is the lux bag not real leather holy
[13529.62 --> 13538.10]  crap breaking news reddit is down whoa what nice that doesn't happen all the time constantly
[13538.90 --> 13544.74]  upstream connect error or disconnect reset before headers reset reason connection failure it works on
[13544.74 --> 13551.70]  my machine really we'll just ship my machine then i think he's memeing no
[13551.70 --> 13556.98]  no i actually have it oh yeah no someone else said it's working i just got i got a different
[13556.98 --> 13562.90]  error this time no healthy upstream i mean that's the thing about whenever a site is going through
[13562.90 --> 13568.02]  trouble is everyone will start f5ing and that really really doesn't help um
[13571.06 --> 13576.26]  oh yeah no i've got another one uh transport failure reason delayed connect error 111 no i'm
[13576.26 --> 13582.50]  it is it is not up for me uh the reason the lux bag is not leather is because a it's much more
[13582.50 --> 13587.94]  challenging to work with aside from the cost it would be like a two thousand dollar bag or whatever
[13587.94 --> 13592.74]  um aside from the cost it's much more challenging to work with and our backpack is an extremely
[13592.74 --> 13598.58]  detailed design like i just don't even think we could build it out of uh like like uh like full
[13598.58 --> 13601.46]  whatever's the good one full grain leather whatever we would want to use
[13601.46 --> 13606.98]  uh i just don't see how we would do that and number two we were really really impressed
[13607.62 --> 13610.98]  by the apple leather that we used and we were comfortable moving forward with it
[13618.02 --> 13623.94]  hey wanda dll aspiring software developer here i have constantly stressed about my code not being
[13623.94 --> 13628.58]  secure do you have any suggestions on how to secure your software so that you don't do a crowd strike
[13628.58 --> 13639.30]  uh the bare minimum i don't know just keep trying to get better um ask your friends to try to pen test
[13639.30 --> 13646.58]  it if you can um try to pen test it yourself look into how you would do that so that you can learn how
[13646.58 --> 13652.50]  that works so that you can understand when you're writing stuff how that could possibly potentially work
[13653.38 --> 13660.66]  um figure out what cross-site scripting is i feel like that's a type of thing that a lot of newer devs
[13660.66 --> 13666.50]  would end up accidentally making a thing that could do that i don't know let's say three more merch messages
[13666.50 --> 13670.50]  yeah can i do can do
[13670.50 --> 13684.10]  and then you're done yeah i want to swim tonight cool yeah all right okay i'm gonna throw this one
[13684.10 --> 13690.82]  in for me oh oh shoot sorry i thought i was muted um uh uh three more merch messages and then uh luke and
[13690.82 --> 13695.54]  i are agreeing that we're both swimming tonight okay sure i've got this one this will be free i guess x
[13695.54 --> 13700.98]  stylist hair turns orange when lightened because natural undertones are exposed always tone after
[13700.98 --> 13705.94]  lightning reapply lightener in one to two days google hair lightening levels for appropriate toner
[13707.46 --> 13713.38]  i don't know man sure sounds good i like that luke just messed up i'm solving time to try and find an
[13713.38 --> 13717.94]  actual merch message that's probably a better storyline or do you want to pick one yeah i'm probably just
[13717.94 --> 13721.70]  going to leave it the way it is no dan go for it i actually genuinely think the orange just kind of
[13721.70 --> 13727.46]  looks no it doesn't i like it it looks like an amateur job oh yeah no i'm not trying to cover that up
[13729.22 --> 13733.70]  i like this kind of story now yeah if if you had done his hair and it was perfect it would be oh yeah
[13733.70 --> 13746.90]  cool now it's luke's fault and there's story now there's story yeah you messed up bud uh let's see as a
[13746.90 --> 13753.14]  biohacker i wonder if linus or luke would ever get an rfid chip implanted in their hands i thought
[13753.14 --> 13759.14]  about it a few times quite a few times we had a trip tentatively planned um taren van hemer i think
[13759.14 --> 13763.46]  was going to go i was going to go at least a couple other people on staff were going to go we were all
[13763.46 --> 13767.06]  going to go down to um down to washington state there was somewhere that we'd already like talked
[13767.06 --> 13770.90]  to and everything and we're all going to do it we're going to make a video and then covered and then
[13770.90 --> 13781.78]  we didn't go anywhere and then i forgot and then oh yeah uh linus has there ever been a promotional
[13781.78 --> 13787.14]  stunt that dbrand asked you to do that you actually turned down also any idea when the
[13787.14 --> 13789.86]  screwdriver shaft extensions will be back in stock
[13789.86 --> 13804.74]  extensions will come in when they come in i have no idea um as for dbrand promotional stunts
[13805.30 --> 13811.46]  i don't know part of my thing is like i i think a lot of people take themselves too seriously and i
[13811.46 --> 13818.34]  think that's part of the reason that i have ended up with a bit of a like perception that i'm not a
[13818.34 --> 13824.90]  serious person because i don't take myself super seriously like from who oh i just like i mean
[13824.90 --> 13831.94]  community-wise no not from people who actually know me okay um and so so i think that's where you
[13831.94 --> 13837.94]  know some of the the the perception that uh this is not a serious operation or that we don't take
[13837.94 --> 13844.90]  things seriously might come from um but you know what i don't care um i i think that i think that some
[13844.90 --> 13851.06]  people are a little too uptight about their image i think some people like i'm dude i don't think
[13851.06 --> 13857.78]  anything makes me cringe harder than especially in like the music scene and i think you know like
[13857.78 --> 13862.50]  kind of who i'm the kind of characters i'm talking about the people who are never pictured smiling
[13864.90 --> 13871.70]  like crawl out of your own ass and just take a nice picture with somebody for a change you don't
[13871.70 --> 13879.30]  have to you don't have to always look cool you know um it's part of the brand though uh yeah i also
[13879.30 --> 13884.58]  the world is like so dark and crappy just smile sometimes yeah i just i yeah i just i can't um
[13885.86 --> 13892.02]  it's it's it's cringe it's cringe uh and so i'd rather i'd rather be i'd rather be outwardly cringe
[13892.02 --> 13901.54]  than be like cringe and not even know it if that makes sense yeah uh okay last one i got for you
[13901.54 --> 13907.62]  then hey dll i'm confused about gaming handhelds why are they all so big why is there no steam deck
