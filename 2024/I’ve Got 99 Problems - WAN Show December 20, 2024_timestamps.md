I have had the need to frequently change my time settings on windows... when I was dual-booting with linux. IIRC, one of the two auto-sets the BIOS clock to UTC and adjusts the OS clock based on timezone, while the other assumes the BIOS clock is in current timezone and doesn't check... or something along those lines.
The end result is that linux has the correct time but windows does not, until you toggle the "auto-detect timezone" switch on and off.
Maybe that's fixed by now in W11, or maybe it was the Dell BIOS's fault. But it was annoying at the time when I needed both OSs (AND an accurate timestamp on digital signatures).
I don't bother dualbooting anymore. Anything I need windows for can sit in a VM.

Ohh so many of these resonate...
For sleep my biggest issue is my mouse always wakes my pc and I can't get it to stop. And it's super sensitive, if the desk gets nudged, pc wakes up. I should be able to tell windows to ONLY wake if the keyboard wants it, rather than have to hunt down the 300 different virtual devices and it still waking up because the wind blows. 
For monitors going to sleep without a signal, my previous one, a Samsung Odyssey G7 I think, was really terrible at that... It had a timeout of 3 seconds, and it was also pretty slow to wake. So if I turned my pc on, it was just awake to let me get a brief flash of the post screen, then it would turn off again in the brief time before the windows login screen appeared and I'd be waiting for it to wake up again. It was infuriating and strangely enough the LG C4 I use as a monitor now even gives me a better experience (with the unofficial app).
For Teams, ugh there's so much... One of the worst is that Teams does not use Windows' own localisation settings. I'm Dutch but I prefer my software to be in English. But if I set Teams to US, the date is displayed as month day year and if I copy that to Excel it gets messed up. Also if you try to copy something from a message, it's very hard to only copy what you want instead of the whole message including headers. And if you actually want to copy multiple messages, it randomly decides when to include timestamps and when not... It's like they actively try to make this program as bad as they can...
