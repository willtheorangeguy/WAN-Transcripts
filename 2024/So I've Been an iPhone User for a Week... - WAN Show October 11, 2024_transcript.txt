[0.00 --> 11.60]  Happy Friday everybody and welcome to the WAN show. We have a fantastic show lined up for you guys this week because both Dan and Luke are in uncharacteristically good moods.
[11.60 --> 11.90]  Yeah!
[14.90 --> 16.20]  And they...
[16.20 --> 17.80]  Dan's just trying to fly away apparently.
[18.48 --> 21.74]  They're in good moods so rarely they don't know how to express it.
[21.90 --> 23.08]  So they're just awkward.
[25.02 --> 28.50]  I don't know what this emotion is.
[28.50 --> 29.76]  I'm scared.
[30.00 --> 38.68]  On the show we'll be talking about the video that we did on me taking the A plus exam and the fact that it is down.
[38.68 --> 45.00]  We will also be live verifying whether my certificate is still active or not.
[45.16 --> 46.90]  If it's not we have to like burn it or something.
[47.14 --> 49.02]  I guess so. I think that's how it works.
[49.54 --> 58.58]  We'll also be talking about my experience so far with the iPhone 16 plus which I have a lot of notes about.
[58.90 --> 59.16]  Oh.
[59.16 --> 60.30]  Like a lot.
[60.74 --> 61.10]  Oh.
[61.52 --> 62.84]  What else we got this week Luke?
[63.04 --> 67.66]  The WordPress feud is kind of bad news for like a bunch of the internet.
[67.66 --> 71.08]  And also a bunch of M1 Macs are breaking.
[71.76 --> 72.10]  Really?
[72.26 --> 74.32]  I guess Apple wants you to finally upgrade.
[74.84 --> 75.04]  Oh.
[75.54 --> 75.84]  Huh.
[76.16 --> 77.26]  That's one way to do it.
[77.26 --> 101.70]  The show is brought to you today by Supermicro NSI Ridge.
[101.70 --> 104.06]  And of course our chair partner Secret Lab.
[104.06 --> 107.88]  Our laptop partner LG and our wrap partner Dbrand.
[108.84 --> 109.42]  That's a lot of partners.
[109.58 --> 110.30]  They wrapped our table.
[110.38 --> 111.50]  We have so many partners.
[111.72 --> 111.82]  Yeah.
[111.82 --> 113.96]  We're like an open relationship channel.
[114.02 --> 115.70]  We're almost like that one in Seattle but not quite.
[115.94 --> 116.86]  We got a long way to go.
[116.90 --> 117.82]  There's a thing in Seattle?
[118.00 --> 119.20]  Oh have you heard of that?
[119.32 --> 119.50]  No.
[119.50 --> 120.22]  Dan's heard of that.
[120.46 --> 121.90]  Dan why does Dan know about this?
[121.98 --> 123.24]  Dan where did you come from again?
[123.34 --> 124.36]  Everybody knows about it.
[124.44 --> 125.58]  We're all in it.
[126.50 --> 129.72]  There's like a massive polycule in Seattle or something like that.
[129.84 --> 130.62]  And there's so many jokes.
[130.74 --> 132.68]  There's like 30,000, 40,000 people.
[133.34 --> 134.30]  How big is it?
[134.32 --> 135.72]  I actually don't know what the real number is.
[135.72 --> 136.02]  Wow.
[136.08 --> 136.36]  Okay.
[136.48 --> 139.24]  Well why don't we talk about tech for a little bit shall we?
[141.24 --> 145.72]  I originally planned to do only one video on the iPhone 16.
[146.14 --> 147.00]  Oh you're doing more.
[147.24 --> 149.26]  Well I'm going to talk about it.
[149.26 --> 150.60]  I'm going to talk about it a little bit.
[150.62 --> 151.48]  iPhone wars.
[151.60 --> 153.36]  The original plan was one video.
[153.36 --> 156.70]  I was going to wait, I was going to use it for like a month.
[157.04 --> 159.48]  Wait for iOS 18.1 to come out.
[159.60 --> 161.90]  Which is going to have the new Apple intelligence features.
[162.04 --> 166.74]  So that I could do one video reviewing the complete iPhone 16 experience.
[166.78 --> 167.86]  Except here's a small problem.
[168.04 --> 168.26]  Okay.
[168.40 --> 171.70]  This is my document of notes so far.
[173.96 --> 174.44]  Whoa.
[176.84 --> 177.86]  That's more than a video.
[178.24 --> 182.34]  If those are good, like you know, sometimes a whole section of notes comes down into like a line.
[182.34 --> 186.86]  But if those are, you know, not very compressible, that's multiple videos.
[187.22 --> 192.88]  This is one of the buggiest device experiences that I have had in recent memory.
[193.56 --> 193.80]  Whoa.
[194.16 --> 198.38]  And I shouldn't say, it's not just the bugginess either.
[198.92 --> 200.70]  And you're 100% sure it's bugginess.
[200.84 --> 202.68]  It's not unfamiliarity.
[202.68 --> 203.30]  I'll tell you what.
[203.30 --> 207.76]  I'm about to send a file to Dan that is probably going to blow your mind.
[209.58 --> 211.00]  You're sending this file through Teams.
[211.08 --> 211.66]  Is this Teams?
[212.10 --> 212.42]  No.
[213.26 --> 215.02]  What do you mean I'm sending this file through Teams?
[215.26 --> 215.76]  No, no, no.
[215.76 --> 216.60]  It's a screen recording.
[217.16 --> 217.72]  Or no, sorry.
[217.80 --> 218.66]  It's a camera clip.
[218.76 --> 219.76]  It's a clip I recorded.
[220.08 --> 220.38]  Okay.
[220.60 --> 221.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[221.02 --> 223.18]  I'm just sending a file to Dan.
[223.28 --> 224.34]  He's going to play it for the show.
[224.44 --> 225.58]  But are you doing it through Teams?
[225.72 --> 225.86]  What?
[225.92 --> 226.08]  Yeah.
[226.40 --> 226.62]  Okay.
[226.70 --> 227.16]  It doesn't matter.
[227.28 --> 228.46]  Okay, the sending is not the issue.
[228.48 --> 228.68]  No, no.
[228.68 --> 229.30]  It's just a file.
[229.38 --> 229.80]  Okay, I'm missing.
[229.80 --> 230.40]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[230.46 --> 231.64]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[231.94 --> 232.48]  Oh, dude.
[232.56 --> 235.06]  No, I know Teams is a steaming pile of fun.
[236.16 --> 245.06]  I really like, by the way, if anyone from Microsoft is watching, I genuinely feel like I could be helpful if you wanted to improve Teams.
[245.50 --> 251.12]  I have some very easily actionable, extremely massively improving feedback that I could give you.
[251.12 --> 252.44]  And look how good his hair is today.
[252.54 --> 252.78]  Yeah.
[252.92 --> 255.14]  You got to take somebody seriously when they have hair this good.
[255.14 --> 256.96]  That's probably a Microsoft thing.
[257.10 --> 257.30]  Yeah.
[257.40 --> 258.16]  They probably care.
[258.32 --> 259.56]  Yeah, they care a lot.
[259.56 --> 260.14]  Hear me out.
[260.24 --> 260.88]  I can help you.
[260.88 --> 261.86]  That's why they got rid of Balmer.
[265.16 --> 266.48]  That's why they had all those problems.
[266.66 --> 267.36]  More like Baldmer.
[269.90 --> 273.20]  Luke, you can't attack people for, like, male pattern baldness.
[273.28 --> 275.54]  That's, like, half of our audience.
[275.78 --> 276.40]  Oh, yeah.
[276.56 --> 277.04]  Can you not?
[277.14 --> 277.60]  It's fine.
[277.72 --> 281.86]  I thought I was going to be bald my whole life because my dad was bald, and I didn't know that's not how that worked.
[282.28 --> 287.10]  Yeah, I thought I was, too, because I was told it's the men on your mother's side.
[287.10 --> 289.32]  And my grandfather went bald in high school.
[289.60 --> 290.06]  Oh, yeah.
[290.06 --> 292.10]  See, my grandpa had hair the whole time.
[292.10 --> 299.96]  From a very young age, I was like, well, that was part of the reason that I would dye my hair, like, wacky colors in high school.
[300.06 --> 301.40]  I was like, well, I got it.
[301.40 --> 302.36]  Might as well enjoy it while you have it.
[302.58 --> 303.64]  I just never cared.
[303.72 --> 304.82]  I thought my dad was cool.
[304.98 --> 305.60]  He was bald.
[305.60 --> 306.38]  So I was like, whatever.
[306.66 --> 307.44]  I'll just be bald.
[307.70 --> 308.20]  Okay, Dan.
[308.32 --> 309.66]  Do you have that file ready for us?
[309.82 --> 310.02]  Yep.
[310.38 --> 310.60]  Okay.
[310.78 --> 311.80]  Can he hear audio?
[311.96 --> 315.72]  Is that something that we can just do smoothly now, or is that still hit or miss?
[315.84 --> 317.38]  No, it should be good to go.
[317.40 --> 317.74]  Let's do it.
[317.78 --> 318.00]  Okay.
[318.24 --> 318.90]  Play the clip.
[319.26 --> 319.56]  Okay.
[320.24 --> 322.14]  I've always wanted to say, play the clip.
[322.16 --> 322.74]  Play the clip.
[323.16 --> 323.42]  Okay.
[323.74 --> 324.10]  All right.
[324.14 --> 326.06]  Let's see if I mess this up.
[327.82 --> 328.18]  Date?
[328.78 --> 329.14]  Okay.
[329.32 --> 329.54]  Yeah.
[329.54 --> 329.60]  Yeah.
[329.60 --> 329.66]  Yeah.
[335.60 --> 340.16]  I take it this is not intentional.
[343.72 --> 346.32]  Wait, is it playing like four songs at once or something?
[348.24 --> 350.34]  4.16 out of 3.34?
[354.18 --> 355.04]  Oh, my.
[355.38 --> 357.42]  And that's not a problem with your car?
[357.70 --> 358.26]  That's...
[358.26 --> 358.74]  Not as far...
[358.74 --> 362.06]  I've never had a problem with Android Auto in my car like that.
[362.14 --> 362.46]  All right.
[362.46 --> 362.86]  All right.
[363.06 --> 363.46]  All right.
[363.64 --> 364.64]  So it's...
[364.64 --> 366.62]  So there's so many layers of problems here.
[367.50 --> 369.74]  That's not the song that was on the display.
[369.92 --> 370.32]  Okay.
[370.52 --> 373.14]  It was playing at what sounded like at least double the speed.
[373.36 --> 373.38]  Oh, yeah.
[373.46 --> 374.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[374.06 --> 376.22]  And the counter was obviously broken.
[377.00 --> 381.02]  Now, fixing it was as simple as turning it off and turning it back on.
[381.22 --> 381.54]  Okay.
[381.66 --> 381.86]  Right?
[382.62 --> 387.06]  But the issue is that I've had a number of those types of problems.
[387.06 --> 388.06]  Here's another fun one.
[388.40 --> 392.18]  I haven't daily driven an iOS device in a long time.
[392.18 --> 396.70]  And back when I used to iPhone, I used to game on my phone from time to time.
[396.74 --> 401.52]  And one of the games that I liked as just like a pass the time toilet game was Jetpack Joyride.
[401.84 --> 401.96]  Nice.
[401.96 --> 406.72]  And as I was going through and ticking all of the boxes that for all the apps that I used
[406.72 --> 409.80]  to have and just kind of, you know, mass dumping apps onto the phone.
[410.18 --> 415.86]  Because when I did the migration wizard, it prompted me for if I wanted to migrate my apps.
[416.52 --> 420.32]  And the migration wizard is specifically an Android app.
[420.84 --> 422.68]  So it asked me, do you want to migrate your apps?
[422.72 --> 423.92]  And I'm like, sure.
[424.04 --> 424.88]  That sounds convenient.
[425.22 --> 426.82]  So it'll just like grab Twitter.
[427.00 --> 428.92]  No, it just didn't install any of them.
[428.92 --> 430.42]  Absolutely none.
[430.56 --> 431.28]  Absolutely zero.
[432.88 --> 436.10]  So anyway, I was manually installing my apps.
[436.96 --> 438.66]  And like a caveman.
[439.52 --> 441.40]  I fired up Jetpack Joyride.
[441.66 --> 445.06]  And I was like, OK, let's let's play this game.
[445.82 --> 448.48]  And I was sitting on the floor next to the cats.
[448.62 --> 449.72]  And I was like, do, do, do, do, do.
[449.78 --> 450.60]  Yeah, I am.
[450.60 --> 453.86]  I don't know, firing bullets to fire my Jetpack or whatever.
[453.86 --> 455.10]  And I put it down like this.
[455.64 --> 457.72]  And it auto rotated to the other side.
[457.92 --> 459.82]  And then I went, oh, shoot.
[459.86 --> 460.94]  I should have gotten a video of that.
[461.00 --> 462.22]  Because it wouldn't come back.
[463.66 --> 466.86]  OK, well, that's apparently resolved now.
[468.02 --> 470.44]  The developers over at Apple are working fast.
[470.66 --> 471.52]  They're getting it done.
[471.72 --> 473.14]  And I don't think I've gotten any updates.
[473.30 --> 473.72]  So that may.
[474.26 --> 475.14]  I'm just trolling.
[476.02 --> 477.90]  Oh, you know what I bet it was?
[477.98 --> 479.88]  No, I bet I know how to replicate it now.
[479.96 --> 480.18]  Hold on.
[480.22 --> 480.60]  Give me a sec.
[480.68 --> 481.12]  Give me a sec.
[481.12 --> 482.58]  I think I can probably replicate it.
[482.58 --> 484.08]  Here we go.
[485.60 --> 485.92]  OK.
[486.54 --> 487.40]  So I'm resuming.
[487.78 --> 488.76]  I'm putting it down.
[488.92 --> 490.04]  It's going to flip the other way.
[490.18 --> 491.30]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[491.52 --> 492.38]  I bring it back.
[494.14 --> 494.46]  Yeah.
[494.62 --> 495.24]  It's upside down.
[495.48 --> 495.66]  Yeah.
[495.80 --> 496.86]  Why is it upside down, Luke?
[496.96 --> 500.50]  It's a really cool level in Jetpack Joyride where you have to, you have to, oh.
[502.08 --> 502.40]  Well.
[503.94 --> 504.30]  Oh.
[505.34 --> 505.92]  I don't know.
[505.96 --> 506.52]  That seems weird.
[506.58 --> 507.52]  You'd think it would rotate.
[507.62 --> 508.06]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[508.06 --> 508.48]  You'd think that.
[508.48 --> 510.22]  Rotation lock isn't on or anything like that.
[510.22 --> 511.10]  Rotation lock is on.
[511.32 --> 511.60]  Oh.
[511.60 --> 514.52]  But it will only lock one.
[514.68 --> 516.78]  Und exactly one way.
[516.98 --> 518.18]  That just sounds like an Apple thing.
[518.32 --> 519.10]  I don't think that's a bug.
[519.62 --> 526.94]  No, it's an Apple thing in that it is Apple obstinately refusing to implement a landscape
[526.94 --> 527.92]  lock on iOS.
[527.92 --> 532.60]  So iOS only has a portrait lock.
[532.60 --> 534.60]  Portrait orientation lock.
[535.64 --> 542.60]  iPadOS and actually iOS on the iPad both support landscape orientation lock.
[542.60 --> 545.66]  But iOS does not.
[545.66 --> 553.08]  So if you have your display locked and an app forces landscape mode, you can only hold it
[553.08 --> 553.36]  one.
[553.52 --> 555.50]  Oh, it's exactly one way.
[555.62 --> 558.26]  I was going to say, I'm going to steal this from someone in full plane chat named a unique
[558.26 --> 559.96]  username, but you're just holding it wrong.
[561.24 --> 562.34]  Classic Apple problem.
[562.34 --> 565.60]  The thing is that I'm not because the camera bump is here.
[565.80 --> 567.82]  And if I hold it like this, that blows.
[568.30 --> 570.90]  Whereas if I hold it like this, it's a lot better.
[571.20 --> 571.50]  Hold on.
[571.56 --> 572.34]  Can I hold it for a sec?
[572.44 --> 573.00]  Yeah, absolutely.
[573.26 --> 573.64]  I wonder.
[575.22 --> 576.72]  You know you don't have to ask permission, right?
[577.42 --> 577.78]  Sorry.
[577.78 --> 585.32]  And this whole orientation lock.
[585.42 --> 586.38]  I think I disagree.
[586.78 --> 587.10]  Really?
[589.26 --> 590.62]  Finger connects there.
[590.96 --> 593.36]  If I go like this, nothing touches the camera.
[594.62 --> 595.64]  This is more comfortable.
[595.64 --> 599.76]  You have much larger hands than me, which to be clear is fine.
[600.16 --> 605.12]  If some people prefer this way and some people prefer this way, that's totally cool.
[605.12 --> 609.44]  Unless your name is Apple, in which case that is not totally cool.
[609.68 --> 610.22]  Not allowed.
[611.76 --> 616.30]  And so we use iPhones as teleprompters.
[616.46 --> 617.28]  Volume buttons are up.
[617.98 --> 619.92]  We use iPhones as teleprompters.
[620.14 --> 625.88]  And so the inability to lock them in landscape and leave them has resulted in us needing to
[625.88 --> 630.68]  do this really obnoxious onset maneuver that we call the dip.
[630.68 --> 636.82]  So every time one of the camera operators, you know, let's go to the camera to do something
[636.82 --> 641.82]  with their hands or whatever and picks it back up, it'll have gone back to portrait orientation
[641.82 --> 642.24]  or whatever.
[642.36 --> 643.50]  And I'll have to be like, do the dip.
[643.84 --> 647.40]  And they have to go like this with the whole camera rig and then lift it back up in order
[647.40 --> 652.62]  to reorient the teleprompter because you cannot lock it in landscape mode.
[652.62 --> 658.60]  And so even apps that do force the iPhone to go to landscape mode will leave it locked
[658.60 --> 665.98]  in the wrong orientation potentially because it doesn't properly have a landscape orientation
[665.98 --> 666.36]  lock.
[667.02 --> 672.96]  And dude, there have been so many things like that.
[673.02 --> 674.52]  There's a lot of stuff that's really good.
[674.70 --> 680.62]  In fact, I would say probably a solid 60 to 70% of this is really good stuff.
[680.62 --> 684.26]  Their background playback is so cool.
[684.46 --> 685.38]  So check this out.
[685.44 --> 687.40]  I'm going to, I'm going to load something up on my Plex.
[689.38 --> 689.74]  Okay.
[689.78 --> 690.36]  So check this out.
[690.42 --> 691.74]  We're going to go, we're going to go.
[692.02 --> 694.28]  Oh, and the speakers are great.
[695.02 --> 696.06]  Speakers are fricking amazing.
[696.24 --> 696.54]  Okay.
[696.68 --> 696.92]  Okay.
[696.92 --> 697.70]  That was another thing.
[697.82 --> 700.36]  Did you see how I swiped it up and it went up into the dynamic Island?
[701.06 --> 701.42]  Sure.
[702.00 --> 702.32]  Okay.
[702.58 --> 704.68]  This time it goes to picture in picture.
[704.78 --> 706.52]  I, I can't find the pattern here.
[706.58 --> 708.14]  That's probably how much you're.
[708.28 --> 708.54]  Yeah.
[708.54 --> 714.26]  I thought that, um, and then I swiped it really fast and it like totally didn't go up into
[714.26 --> 714.64]  the Island.
[714.78 --> 714.98]  Huh?
[715.12 --> 715.98]  So I don't know.
[716.02 --> 717.10]  I haven't looked it up.
[717.22 --> 719.40]  I'm, I will, I will figure that out before the read.
[719.40 --> 722.42]  I cannot get YouTube to go picture in picture no matter what I do.
[722.66 --> 724.60]  Uh, but Plex sometimes goes on the Island.
[724.70 --> 728.02]  Sometimes goes picture in picture, but when it is working, check this out, check this out.
[728.28 --> 728.88]  Background playback.
[729.02 --> 729.42]  Watch this.
[730.22 --> 730.48]  Boom.
[730.96 --> 731.70]  Tucked it over there.
[732.62 --> 733.26]  Background playback.
[733.38 --> 733.82]  Still going.
[733.96 --> 734.58]  There's a little arrow.
[734.74 --> 734.92]  Boom.
[735.26 --> 736.24]  Bring it back out like that.
[736.24 --> 738.16]  So cool.
[738.36 --> 738.84]  That's neat.
[739.04 --> 739.46]  That's nice.
[739.60 --> 747.78]  If you're into background playback, um, that's a really cool sort of extra background that
[747.78 --> 749.32]  you can, that you can push it back to.
[749.38 --> 750.02]  And you know what?
[750.04 --> 753.38]  I'm sure there's variants of Android that do support stuff like that.
[753.88 --> 758.90]  Um, but this was my first experience with it and I loved it.
[758.90 --> 762.54]  Oh, I have a whole paragraph on this.
[762.54 --> 764.46]  Do you see what's going on on the phone right now?
[766.82 --> 767.34]  Yeah.
[767.60 --> 768.20]  Camera's open.
[768.60 --> 768.86]  Okay.
[769.12 --> 777.76]  This, this camera button is probably the greatest difference between how good an idea seems
[777.76 --> 781.60]  on paper and how bad it is in practice that I have ever seen.
[782.56 --> 784.72]  In theory, it's great.
[784.92 --> 786.06]  I want to use my camera.
[786.22 --> 788.52]  I'm like, boom, camera button.
[789.12 --> 789.68]  Let's go.
[789.80 --> 790.80]  I'm taking pictures.
[791.12 --> 791.50]  Boom, boom.
[791.60 --> 793.06]  I'm taking pictures with this button.
[793.20 --> 793.60]  Let's go.
[793.84 --> 797.48]  You can also click it a little bit and you can like adjust stuff and it's, it's super cool.
[797.56 --> 798.20]  You can zoom.
[798.30 --> 798.72]  You can zoom.
[798.78 --> 799.04]  Let's go.
[799.12 --> 799.66]  Let's zoom.
[799.66 --> 806.74]  In practice, the ratio of times I hit it on purpose to times I hit it by accident is about
[806.74 --> 807.36]  one to five.
[808.84 --> 812.80]  Cause every time I hold the bloody phone, where else am I supposed to hold it?
[812.94 --> 814.72]  It's got the volume buttons over here.
[814.84 --> 816.18]  The action button over here.
[816.26 --> 817.76]  It's got the lock button over here.
[817.86 --> 818.74]  It's got the camera button.
[818.74 --> 824.34]  Where the hell am I supposed to hold this phone and not have it start changing my volume
[824.34 --> 826.74]  or locking itself or fricking opening the camera?
[826.82 --> 828.02]  It's driving me absolutely crazy.
[828.10 --> 828.28]  Yes.
[828.32 --> 829.48]  I know I'm holding it wrong.
[829.56 --> 830.44]  Ghost of jobs.
[830.62 --> 831.92]  I don't care.
[833.52 --> 837.52]  If I'm going to complain about a Bixby button, I'm going to complain about a camera button.
[837.62 --> 838.38]  It's that simple.
[839.90 --> 841.18]  My phone has a camera button.
[841.54 --> 842.56]  I don't have issues with it.
[843.04 --> 844.82]  Well, how nice for you, Dan.
[844.96 --> 845.96]  How nice for you.
[845.96 --> 851.24]  Hey, animations make iOS feel fricking slow.
[851.78 --> 856.52]  Sometimes like just every single time you unlock your phone, you need to wait around
[856.52 --> 856.94]  for that.
[857.34 --> 862.86]  Oh, and the fact that you have to, the fact that you have to interact with the screen to
[862.86 --> 866.84]  unlock the phone drives me crazy.
[866.84 --> 867.58]  Can you do it again?
[867.92 --> 868.14]  Sorry.
[868.20 --> 868.64]  Can I see it again?
[869.98 --> 872.86]  Oh, well, first I have to buy it.
[872.86 --> 873.40]  Oh my God.
[873.92 --> 874.32]  Sorry.
[875.96 --> 877.00]  Okay.
[877.08 --> 878.34]  So first you biometrically authenticate.
[878.44 --> 879.40]  I am unlocked right now.
[879.46 --> 879.70]  Okay.
[879.94 --> 881.68]  But I have to interact with it again.
[881.82 --> 882.02]  Yeah.
[882.14 --> 883.82]  And I have to wait around for that animation.
[884.00 --> 885.88]  Because mine has an animation too, but it's a lot faster.
[886.06 --> 886.24]  Yeah.
[886.44 --> 886.64]  Yeah.
[886.72 --> 892.26]  And you don't have to touch your screen in order to get rid of the lock screen.
[892.26 --> 898.10]  So for those of you who are iOS users, you can just touch your touch sensor or face your
[898.10 --> 900.20]  phone and you are just at the desktop.
[900.28 --> 903.42]  You don't have to swipe at it.
[903.98 --> 904.24]  Yeah.
[905.04 --> 905.48]  Oh man.
[905.54 --> 906.06]  What else is there?
[906.06 --> 908.34]  Apparently you can turn off the animations in accessibility.
[909.08 --> 910.12]  Why does Apple hide?
[910.20 --> 912.08]  So actually I have a whole paragraph on that.
[912.36 --> 912.60]  Thank you, Dan.
[912.60 --> 912.80]  Good.
[913.00 --> 913.12]  Or Dan.
[913.12 --> 915.58]  Why does Apple hide all the coolest features under accessibility?
[916.22 --> 920.78]  They have this new display tech that allows them to go all the way down to one nit.
[921.22 --> 921.86]  And apparently.
[922.04 --> 924.30]  We haven't actually tested whether it can do one nit or not.
[924.30 --> 928.38]  But what I can tell you is it gets really dim at night.
[928.80 --> 933.30]  As long as you go into the accessibility menu and enable whatever this is called.
[934.58 --> 934.94]  Whatever.
[935.08 --> 937.16]  This little sun thing here in the control center.
[937.16 --> 938.30]  Like why?
[938.48 --> 940.46]  Especially if you're going to have the feature in your keynote.
[941.76 --> 943.32]  Why is it hidden in accessibility?
[943.58 --> 948.82]  It's like when for so long they hid mouse support on the iPad under accessibility.
[949.46 --> 952.56]  Maybe it's a bid to try to normalize accessibility options.
[954.30 --> 957.00]  I think that.
[957.00 --> 958.42]  It seems like a maybe Apple thing.
[958.64 --> 958.88]  That.
[959.04 --> 960.72]  I don't think so.
[961.40 --> 961.86]  I'm going to.
[961.94 --> 964.04]  I'm going to go with no.
[965.96 --> 968.54]  I have considered a no.
[969.12 --> 969.50]  Yeah.
[969.50 --> 970.28]  I have no idea.
[971.58 --> 973.08]  Android locks them in developer mode.
[973.30 --> 973.50]  Yeah.
[974.88 --> 977.48]  But I feel like it has less of them to lock.
[977.72 --> 978.20]  If you know what I mean.
[979.42 --> 980.00]  I'm going to.
[980.02 --> 981.36]  I'm going to add a note here.
[982.02 --> 984.28]  Check the animation speeds.
[984.30 --> 986.20]  See if it can be improved.
[987.24 --> 991.30]  The thing that I'm pretty sure can't be is I'm pretty sure you have to physically interact
[991.30 --> 992.68]  with the device in order to unlock it.
[992.76 --> 994.42]  And that's the thing that slows me down the most.
[994.50 --> 995.30]  Because I pretty much.
[996.90 --> 1000.56]  Like I pretty much need a second hand in order to.
[1000.76 --> 1001.42]  In order to.
[1001.72 --> 1001.94]  Here.
[1002.02 --> 1002.30]  Hold on.
[1002.50 --> 1002.56]  Bleh.
[1002.76 --> 1002.94]  Bleh.
[1002.94 --> 1006.22]  I pretty much need a second hand.
[1006.70 --> 1008.62]  In order to get all the way to the bottom.
[1009.00 --> 1009.94]  Especially on the plus.
[1010.16 --> 1011.76]  And if you can't get all the way to the bottom.
[1012.00 --> 1012.92]  You can't just swipe here.
[1013.00 --> 1014.22]  Because that'll just pull up your notifications.
[1014.64 --> 1015.68]  And you can't just go again.
[1016.78 --> 1017.22]  It doesn't.
[1017.42 --> 1017.72]  It doesn't.
[1017.78 --> 1019.34]  You have to get all the way down to the bottom.
[1019.48 --> 1020.64]  In order to unlock it.
[1021.04 --> 1023.64]  Another thing that drives me absolutely crazy.
[1024.04 --> 1025.60]  Is the scrolling speed is locked.
[1026.12 --> 1026.70]  It's gated.
[1027.54 --> 1029.98]  So when I'm just like scrolling through a news feed or something.
[1030.30 --> 1030.68]  Like here.
[1030.84 --> 1031.08]  I bet.
[1031.36 --> 1031.70]  I bet.
[1032.26 --> 1034.62]  Have you tried to daily drive an iPhone like ever?
[1035.04 --> 1035.28]  Okay.
[1035.52 --> 1037.24]  So just scroll through a news feed.
[1037.40 --> 1038.42]  And see how that feels for you.
[1038.52 --> 1039.70]  Just like you're skimming.
[1039.70 --> 1040.88]  It opened eBay.
[1041.48 --> 1041.68]  Oh.
[1041.86 --> 1043.30]  And I don't know how to go back on iPhone.
[1044.26 --> 1044.92]  Oh man.
[1045.00 --> 1047.04]  I got like two paragraphs on that.
[1047.08 --> 1047.58]  I already.
[1047.70 --> 1050.02]  I got stuck in literally less than a second.
[1051.96 --> 1052.36]  Dude.
[1052.50 --> 1054.22]  That's a user error to be clear.
[1054.86 --> 1055.02]  Dude.
[1055.24 --> 1055.50]  I've got.
[1055.58 --> 1055.70]  Yeah.
[1055.70 --> 1056.68]  I've got two paragraphs.
[1056.70 --> 1058.08]  Two paragraphs on back.
[1058.84 --> 1059.08]  Because.
[1059.14 --> 1060.06]  How do you go back?
[1060.10 --> 1060.34]  Well.
[1060.50 --> 1060.82]  There's.
[1060.88 --> 1061.54]  I didn't see a back button.
[1061.54 --> 1062.12]  There's a gesture.
[1062.24 --> 1063.78]  There's a back gesture where you swipe from the left.
[1063.86 --> 1064.00]  Oh.
[1064.10 --> 1064.64]  It's from the other.
[1064.64 --> 1065.38]  So when you're.
[1065.38 --> 1066.40]  When you're like in a.
[1066.44 --> 1066.68]  In a.
[1066.84 --> 1067.20]  You know.
[1067.20 --> 1068.52]  Browser window or whatever else.
[1068.56 --> 1068.98]  You just go for.
[1069.08 --> 1069.22]  Okay.
[1069.26 --> 1069.84]  Well I'm not.
[1071.06 --> 1071.56]  Oh right.
[1071.60 --> 1072.22]  I'm not using Chrome.
[1072.34 --> 1073.16]  I'm using Safari.
[1073.28 --> 1074.24]  I'm trying to have the Apple experience.
[1074.36 --> 1074.46]  Okay.
[1074.50 --> 1075.42]  So I'm on LTT store.
[1076.18 --> 1076.98]  If I want to go back.
[1077.06 --> 1077.48]  I go like that.
[1077.84 --> 1077.96]  Yeah.
[1078.02 --> 1079.12]  And if I want to go between tabs.
[1079.18 --> 1079.66]  I go like that.
[1079.82 --> 1080.20]  It's actually.
[1080.42 --> 1080.58]  Yeah.
[1080.58 --> 1081.20]  That's kind of cool.
[1081.26 --> 1081.36]  Sure.
[1081.66 --> 1083.40]  And I have a whole two paragraphs.
[1083.86 --> 1085.74]  On the convenience of the back gesture.
[1087.50 --> 1088.96]  When it works.
[1089.80 --> 1092.16]  Because there's still so many apps.
[1092.16 --> 1095.48]  That use the old iOS paradigm of back is up and in the top left.
[1095.48 --> 1095.66]  Yeah.
[1095.66 --> 1095.90]  Which is.
[1096.02 --> 1097.30]  For a right handed user.
[1097.42 --> 1097.96]  Super annoying.
[1098.00 --> 1099.70]  The single worst possible place.
[1099.72 --> 1099.92]  Yeah.
[1100.14 --> 1101.06]  To have the back button.
[1101.36 --> 1101.68]  iOS.
[1102.18 --> 1103.88]  Whether Apple users know it or not.
[1104.64 --> 1104.96]  iOS.
[1105.46 --> 1105.94]  Needs.
[1106.26 --> 1107.56]  A proper universal.
[1108.28 --> 1109.14]  Back something.
[1109.14 --> 1111.16]  And so I've started documenting.
[1111.44 --> 1112.84]  All the times I've encountered.
[1113.00 --> 1114.80]  When back gesture doesn't go back.
[1114.82 --> 1115.02]  I wonder if.
[1115.14 --> 1115.84]  Do you think you could.
[1116.36 --> 1116.54]  Hmm.
[1117.04 --> 1119.54]  I think you should try to pour through the accessibility options.
[1119.60 --> 1122.14]  Because I wonder if you can switch which side it goes back.
[1122.20 --> 1122.42]  I will.
[1122.48 --> 1123.12]  But it doesn't matter.
[1123.52 --> 1124.94]  Because it just isn't.
[1124.94 --> 1126.60]  It just doesn't go back a lot.
[1126.92 --> 1129.16]  Because like needing to swipe from the left hand side.
[1129.22 --> 1130.22]  Sounds less convenient.
[1130.44 --> 1130.66]  Oh yeah.
[1130.68 --> 1132.64]  It's possible that there's an accessibility option for that.
[1132.76 --> 1132.88]  I'm.
[1133.28 --> 1134.14]  I'm not done.
[1134.50 --> 1135.02]  This is just.
[1135.12 --> 1135.92]  This is raw notes.
[1136.20 --> 1137.94]  And this is what I would take.
[1137.94 --> 1140.16]  Into sort of sitting down descriptor review.
[1140.72 --> 1141.62]  And then I would.
[1141.70 --> 1143.10]  I would go and I would figure out.
[1143.30 --> 1143.62]  If they're.
[1143.70 --> 1144.50]  If they're valid or not.
[1144.56 --> 1146.10]  Like I specifically have stuff in here.
[1146.18 --> 1146.62]  That I'm like.
[1148.52 --> 1148.96]  Check.
[1149.86 --> 1150.62]  Check into this.
[1150.86 --> 1151.74]  Follow this up.
[1152.18 --> 1152.60]  Anyway.
[1152.84 --> 1153.54]  So here.
[1154.74 --> 1155.66]  Is a news feed.
[1155.78 --> 1155.98]  So.
[1156.46 --> 1157.28]  Flip like you're like.
[1157.46 --> 1158.94]  Trying to get past ads and stuff.
[1159.62 --> 1160.22]  That's too slow.
[1160.56 --> 1160.96]  It's.
[1162.30 --> 1162.78]  Way.
[1163.18 --> 1163.76]  Too slow.
[1163.92 --> 1165.08]  It feels like you.
[1165.28 --> 1165.48]  Oh.
[1165.80 --> 1166.20]  Interesting.
[1167.08 --> 1167.68]  If I.
[1167.76 --> 1168.30]  If I like.
[1168.88 --> 1169.92]  Preload some things.
[1169.92 --> 1170.88]  By scrolling a bunch.
[1171.08 --> 1172.62]  And then scroll all the way back up.
[1173.76 --> 1175.04]  I can get it to.
[1175.26 --> 1175.78]  Go quick.
[1176.18 --> 1177.16]  But only for.
[1177.36 --> 1177.96]  Like a little.
[1178.12 --> 1178.48]  Little bit.
[1179.06 --> 1179.32]  Like.
[1179.52 --> 1180.48]  If you go all the way to the top.
[1180.60 --> 1181.42]  And then try to crank.
[1181.52 --> 1181.94]  It'll go.
[1182.34 --> 1183.80]  It's still not the speed.
[1184.08 --> 1185.92]  But it feels artificially slowed down.
[1185.98 --> 1186.74]  What it isn't.
[1186.96 --> 1188.52]  Is the speed that I'm moving my finger.
[1188.60 --> 1188.82]  Yeah.
[1188.82 --> 1189.78]  Whereas.
[1190.38 --> 1191.26]  An Android phone.
[1191.46 --> 1192.50]  For the most part.
[1192.98 --> 1193.46]  Will scroll.
[1193.72 --> 1193.74]  Yeah.
[1193.74 --> 1194.86]  As fast as you flick it.
[1194.96 --> 1196.76]  I did one flick of my thumb.
[1196.86 --> 1196.96]  Yeah.
[1196.96 --> 1198.94]  And I got all the way through the whole news reel.
[1199.06 --> 1200.16]  Down to where it had to load more.
[1200.28 --> 1200.40]  Yeah.
[1200.40 --> 1200.86]  And one just.
[1202.22 --> 1203.42]  Which feels way more natural.
[1203.54 --> 1204.04]  I am.
[1205.04 --> 1208.08]  I am quickly coming back to my old conclusion.
[1208.08 --> 1208.64]  That.
[1209.14 --> 1212.78]  iOS is best enjoyed by people who aren't as busy as I am.
[1212.78 --> 1217.98]  Because pretty much everything takes a little bit longer on iOS.
[1218.78 --> 1220.38]  Pretty much everything I do.
[1220.82 --> 1222.88]  In spite of how slow the Note 9 is.
[1223.10 --> 1224.98]  When I'm not gated by the SoC.
[1225.40 --> 1228.78]  So installing an app for instance is much faster on the iPhone.
[1228.90 --> 1230.84]  Compared to a five year old phone.
[1230.88 --> 1232.10]  Or however old that stupid thing is.
[1232.10 --> 1232.42]  Sure.
[1233.50 --> 1235.96]  But in terms of just the interface.
[1236.56 --> 1238.98]  Do you know you can't resize the keyboard?
[1242.12 --> 1242.56]  What?
[1242.78 --> 1242.96]  Why?
[1243.48 --> 1244.92]  Can you install third party keyboards?
[1245.12 --> 1245.58]  Yes.
[1245.80 --> 1246.04]  Okay.
[1246.14 --> 1247.34]  And even SwiftKey.
[1247.42 --> 1248.32]  I can't resize.
[1248.64 --> 1249.16]  Oh weird.
[1249.40 --> 1249.62]  Okay.
[1249.78 --> 1250.92]  And I can't.
[1250.92 --> 1252.98]  I can't long press for special characters.
[1253.20 --> 1256.40]  I'm one of the few people remaining on the planet who cares about punctuation.
[1256.90 --> 1259.86]  And I like actually just literally can't on this thing.
[1260.42 --> 1261.12]  Like yeah.
[1261.26 --> 1262.02]  I can navigate.
[1262.16 --> 1263.16]  Is that actually not a thing?
[1263.28 --> 1263.56]  There's no.
[1263.60 --> 1263.76]  Yeah.
[1263.82 --> 1263.92]  No.
[1263.96 --> 1266.36]  I can navigate to a sub menu of special characters.
[1266.82 --> 1270.26]  And then what about second sub menu of special characters?
[1270.46 --> 1270.76]  And I can.
[1270.76 --> 1271.40]  I've noticed that.
[1271.40 --> 1273.20]  That drives me actually insane.
[1273.70 --> 1274.96]  I hate the second.
[1275.10 --> 1276.30]  I hate the second menu.
[1277.46 --> 1277.96]  Oh my god.
[1277.96 --> 1279.02]  People are saying you can.
[1280.16 --> 1280.60]  Where?
[1280.74 --> 1281.72]  You can resize the keyboard.
[1281.76 --> 1282.94]  It's probably in accessibility options.
[1284.54 --> 1285.80]  Just long press on the key.
[1286.00 --> 1286.14]  Yeah.
[1286.22 --> 1288.62]  People are saying long press works for them and you can resize the keyboard.
[1289.34 --> 1289.68]  These are.
[1289.68 --> 1291.42]  In Linus's defense.
[1291.56 --> 1291.88]  Hold on.
[1291.94 --> 1292.70]  These are notes.
[1293.06 --> 1293.74]  They're not done.
[1293.84 --> 1294.00]  Okay.
[1294.04 --> 1294.34]  Hold on.
[1294.40 --> 1294.64]  Hold on.
[1294.68 --> 1294.92]  Hold on.
[1294.96 --> 1295.00]  Hold on.
[1295.00 --> 1295.14]  No, no.
[1295.18 --> 1295.70]  I'm going to switch.
[1295.80 --> 1296.80]  I'm going to switch my keyboard.
[1297.32 --> 1298.86]  I'm going to switch my keyboard right now.
[1298.90 --> 1299.76]  You guys are going to show me.
[1301.70 --> 1303.52]  What are you guys talking about?
[1303.52 --> 1307.66]  Are you talking about like accents?
[1308.32 --> 1309.84]  Like an accented E?
[1309.84 --> 1310.18]  That's not what he means.
[1310.32 --> 1311.14]  That's not what he means.
[1311.26 --> 1314.00]  That is super duper not what I'm talking about.
[1314.08 --> 1314.84]  He wants to hold press.
[1314.90 --> 1315.22]  What is it?
[1315.32 --> 1315.58]  Four?
[1315.66 --> 1316.78]  And then you get asterisk or whatever.
[1316.90 --> 1318.46]  Like he wants that type of stuff.
[1318.58 --> 1320.12]  Hold the bottom left emoji?
[1320.26 --> 1320.84]  Oh my god.
[1320.84 --> 1324.48]  It is amazing how like.
[1327.74 --> 1329.42]  Some people are saying accessibility.
[1330.06 --> 1335.24]  How much better iOS could be.
[1338.42 --> 1339.34]  And isn't.
[1339.72 --> 1340.04]  Okay.
[1340.14 --> 1340.68]  I'm going to go in.
[1340.74 --> 1341.80]  I'm going into accessibility.
[1342.08 --> 1346.88]  We're headed into the accessibility menu because that's apparently where all the good things.
[1347.02 --> 1347.38]  The whole phone.
[1347.60 --> 1348.26]  On the iPhone are.
[1348.80 --> 1349.28]  Okay.
[1349.32 --> 1349.88]  Here we go.
[1349.88 --> 1351.22]  Side button.
[1351.44 --> 1352.34]  Camera control.
[1353.14 --> 1353.70]  Camera control.
[1353.76 --> 1353.86]  Yeah.
[1353.88 --> 1354.92]  You can just disable that.
[1355.02 --> 1357.24]  So that might be what I end up needing to do.
[1358.50 --> 1359.48]  Hearing devices.
[1360.20 --> 1361.24]  Subtitles and captioning.
[1361.30 --> 1361.78]  Speech access.
[1361.88 --> 1362.40]  Keyboard and typing.
[1362.50 --> 1362.74]  Here we go.
[1362.78 --> 1363.04]  Here we go.
[1363.08 --> 1363.38]  Here we go.
[1363.86 --> 1364.08]  Okay.
[1364.16 --> 1364.74]  Hover typing.
[1364.74 --> 1365.58]  Key repeat.
[1365.90 --> 1367.34]  Show lowercase keys.
[1368.58 --> 1369.28]  Slow keys.
[1369.50 --> 1370.30]  Sticky keys.
[1370.70 --> 1372.14]  I was saying long press the globe.
[1372.26 --> 1373.12]  I thought that was a joke.
[1373.56 --> 1373.58]  But.
[1373.76 --> 1374.62]  Long press the globe.
[1374.72 --> 1374.86]  Okay.
[1374.92 --> 1375.20]  Hold on.
[1375.24 --> 1375.48]  Hold on.
[1375.56 --> 1376.02]  Hold on.
[1376.08 --> 1376.70]  Hack the world.
[1376.98 --> 1377.74]  Hack the world.
[1377.78 --> 1378.22]  Hack the planet.
[1378.38 --> 1379.10]  Long press the globe.
[1379.22 --> 1379.32]  Okay.
[1379.32 --> 1379.66]  Here we go.
[1379.66 --> 1381.34]  Long press the globe.
[1382.50 --> 1382.98]  Okay.
[1383.44 --> 1384.14]  Keyboard settings.
[1384.22 --> 1384.48]  Here we go.
[1384.52 --> 1384.78]  Here we go.
[1384.82 --> 1385.14]  Here we go.
[1385.92 --> 1386.36]  Okay.
[1388.58 --> 1391.02]  Long press the globe was apparently a real sentence.
[1391.74 --> 1394.22]  I literally thought they were just trolling.
[1394.60 --> 1395.92]  Everything's so obfuscated.
[1395.92 --> 1396.36]  Okay.
[1396.36 --> 1398.94]  So I have a one handed keyboard here.
[1399.60 --> 1402.68]  I have show math results.
[1405.46 --> 1406.54]  Period shortcut.
[1406.82 --> 1407.52]  Slide to type.
[1407.82 --> 1408.10]  Delete.
[1408.42 --> 1409.56]  Slide to type by word.
[1409.66 --> 1410.40]  Enable dictation.
[1410.48 --> 1411.30]  Auto punctuation.
[1411.30 --> 1414.22]  I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[1414.22 --> 1418.42]  So the bottom options to scoot it to the left or right.
[1418.62 --> 1419.98]  Why would I want to do that?
[1420.92 --> 1422.72]  I don't think that's what he means by resize.
[1423.36 --> 1424.40]  Oh my God.
[1424.46 --> 1425.60]  You can resize it.
[1425.98 --> 1429.84]  As long as you resize it exactly the way that Apple wants you to resize it.
[1429.88 --> 1430.68]  You guys don't.
[1431.52 --> 1435.06]  See, this is the funny thing is it's just like the T9 dialing thing.
[1435.68 --> 1442.38]  Where talking to iOS users is a little hard because it almost feels like we're speaking a completely different language.
[1442.70 --> 1447.48]  When I say resize a keyboard, I mean move it wherever the fuck you want.
[1447.92 --> 1449.88]  And make it any size you want.
[1452.10 --> 1454.86]  That is not resizing a keyboard.
[1455.10 --> 1455.30]  Well.
[1456.44 --> 1457.58]  I mean it is.
[1457.96 --> 1459.50]  But not in the way that you meant.
[1461.04 --> 1462.32]  It's not a stupid feature.
[1462.42 --> 1463.08]  No, it's cool.
[1463.46 --> 1463.62]  Yeah.
[1463.62 --> 1469.08]  Because by shoving it to one side, especially if you have smaller hands, you can reach all the keys significantly more easily.
[1469.66 --> 1476.32]  And by being able to put it to either side, that means that it can work that way for people that are left or right handed.
[1476.94 --> 1479.36]  Especially, say, if you only have one hand.
[1480.36 --> 1483.24]  But what he's talking about is completely different.
[1483.66 --> 1486.24]  Pugboy asks, but how many people really do these things often?
[1486.76 --> 1487.16]  Nobody.
[1487.74 --> 1489.04]  Nobody does them often.
[1489.16 --> 1492.40]  You do them one time so that your phone works really well for you.
[1492.40 --> 1496.40]  I'm pretty sure I set up my keyboard like close to a decade ago.
[1496.52 --> 1499.30]  And just every time I've migrated Android phones, it just comes with me.
[1499.88 --> 1500.08]  Yeah.
[1500.26 --> 1500.92]  Like, I don't know.
[1501.24 --> 1503.18]  I don't remember the last time I did anything with the keyboard.
[1503.30 --> 1507.30]  But I spent quite a while like grinding on keyboard settings like forever ago.
[1507.46 --> 1508.54]  Found a thing that I like.
[1508.74 --> 1511.00]  And now I can like go fast and everything seems good.
[1511.00 --> 1512.54]  Oh, man.
[1512.62 --> 1515.94]  This is like such a, this is a take that just drives me crazy.
[1516.12 --> 1519.34]  Sifrin says, yes, it's a device not for someone like you.
[1519.46 --> 1520.14]  That's the point.
[1520.40 --> 1521.80]  I hope they don't make it like you want.
[1521.90 --> 1522.76]  That would be an Android.
[1524.40 --> 1524.80]  No.
[1525.60 --> 1527.28]  It would just be a better iPhone.
[1527.28 --> 1531.62]  And then if you never wanted to turn any of that stuff on, you could just not.
[1532.20 --> 1533.54]  Just, yeah, just bury it under settings.
[1534.16 --> 1539.72]  Additional settings are like basically never bad as long as they're dumped in menus.
[1540.36 --> 1540.86]  So when I.
[1540.98 --> 1541.78]  Dumped deeper in menus.
[1541.98 --> 1543.30]  So when I say long press guys.
[1543.32 --> 1544.20]  You don't want them in front of the users.
[1544.24 --> 1545.92]  Here, let me, let me explain what I mean.
[1546.28 --> 1546.76]  Um.
[1546.76 --> 1549.70]  Long pressing for special characters.
[1549.94 --> 1550.58]  Oh my God.
[1550.62 --> 1551.62]  You're not going to be able to see this.
[1551.78 --> 1551.98]  Well.
[1552.16 --> 1553.94]  That's, it's quite a flashbang you have there.
[1554.12 --> 1554.86]  Yeah, I know.
[1554.90 --> 1555.12]  Right.
[1555.32 --> 1558.12]  So basically what happens is every one of my characters.
[1558.76 --> 1562.40]  I have every one of my alpha characters has a secondary character on it.
[1562.74 --> 1564.22]  So Q is percent.
[1564.42 --> 1566.50]  W is the little hat.
[1566.60 --> 1567.88]  I always forget what that thing's called.
[1568.34 --> 1570.68]  I've got my parentheses over on the right over here.
[1570.72 --> 1571.82]  I've got my at on the A.
[1572.20 --> 1575.00]  So all I have to do is long press for 200 milliseconds.
[1575.00 --> 1577.30]  And I can type that special character.
[1577.64 --> 1579.12]  And like I dialed that in.
[1579.18 --> 1580.88]  So mine is shorter than 200 milliseconds.
[1581.40 --> 1589.26]  So if you type really quickly on your phone, then it's super useful to be able to say,
[1589.40 --> 1593.34]  hey, if I hold it ever so slightly longer, I get a special character instead of interacting
[1593.34 --> 1598.64]  one, two, three times in order to type a special character.
[1599.22 --> 1599.74]  Um.
[1600.14 --> 1604.08]  Assuming that it's two menus deep, which it sometimes very well can be.
[1604.08 --> 1612.48]  And when I say resize your keyboard, um, what I mean is here, let me get into the, uh, let
[1612.48 --> 1613.76]  me get into the settings for this.
[1613.84 --> 1615.30]  This you'll be able to see from there.
[1615.30 --> 1625.74]  And I hate actually editing this because, uh, like once I get kind of dialed into it, I'm
[1625.74 --> 1627.12]  yeah, pretty fast.
[1627.38 --> 1637.90]  Uh, when I say resize your keyboard, I mean like, like that or like that or like that or
[1637.90 --> 1639.02]  like however you want.
[1639.02 --> 1643.54]  Basically, I mean actually resize your keyboard.
[1643.66 --> 1644.34]  Oh, reset.
[1644.44 --> 1644.80]  There we go.
[1645.38 --> 1649.86]  Um, I don't mean give me a couple options for if I like to type one handed.
[1651.12 --> 1651.52]  Um.
[1655.26 --> 1655.70]  Yeah.
[1656.36 --> 1656.58]  Yeah.
[1656.64 --> 1658.28]  Four presses, including getting back to letters.
[1658.38 --> 1658.92]  Yes, you're right.
[1658.92 --> 1665.40]  So, yeah guys, um, how many times do you change its size?
[1665.44 --> 1666.16]  That's the whole point.
[1666.22 --> 1667.02]  You change it one time.
[1667.72 --> 1672.16]  Um, and if you change phones, for example, if you were to go from a regular iPhone to an
[1672.16 --> 1675.66]  iPhone plus, you might be really used to using a smaller keyboard.
[1675.86 --> 1680.52]  And it may be beneficial for you, A, to be able to type more accurately, to just set it
[1680.52 --> 1681.42]  to a smaller size.
[1681.42 --> 1684.46]  And B, to get back more of your screen space.
[1684.90 --> 1690.02]  That's one of the things that blows me away about the iPhone 2 is how, how undense the
[1690.02 --> 1690.74]  interface is.
[1690.92 --> 1697.96]  There is no way to change the home screen layout to be a by five tile grid.
[1698.58 --> 1699.42]  You can't do it.
[1699.46 --> 1700.28]  It's just by four.
[1700.68 --> 1703.48]  It's like, okay, but I, I don't, I don't like that.
[1703.52 --> 1705.02]  I like to see more things on my screen.
[1705.08 --> 1706.28]  It's like, nope, nope, you can't.
[1706.28 --> 1707.58]  At least you can have blank spaces now.
[1707.66 --> 1710.40]  At least you can have, at least you can have blank spaces now.
[1710.40 --> 1711.04]  Moving forward.
[1711.42 --> 1719.58]  Um, apparently you can touch the one, two, three button and then slide into the normal
[1719.58 --> 1721.78]  keyboard area to get special characters.
[1721.88 --> 1722.00]  Okay.
[1722.04 --> 1722.60]  Let's try that.
[1722.80 --> 1723.94]  The one, two, three button.
[1724.60 --> 1725.22]  And then slide.
[1725.34 --> 1726.06]  Yes, you can.
[1726.20 --> 1730.54]  So that gives you a relatively limited number of special characters because it uses up a
[1730.54 --> 1733.46]  whole row with numbers, but it does give you the main ones.
[1734.30 --> 1736.62]  It's slower, but it's less slower.
[1736.84 --> 1737.26]  Thank you.
[1737.40 --> 1737.70]  That's helpful.
[1738.26 --> 1738.58]  Yes.
[1738.72 --> 1740.62]  That's very, that's very helpful to know.
[1740.62 --> 1741.14]  Pretty neat.
[1741.14 --> 1747.68]  Um, I was so disappointed though, to discover that, uh, and yes, that works on Swift key
[1747.68 --> 1750.32]  as well because that is the Apple implementation.
[1750.58 --> 1754.48]  I was so disappointed to discover that my third party keyboard didn't operate the way that
[1754.48 --> 1758.50]  I would want it to, because to me, that's kind of the point of a third party.
[1758.50 --> 1762.54]  Like if the Apple one is super locked down, I don't really mind that too much as well as,
[1762.54 --> 1764.40]  you know, you could install another one.
[1766.18 --> 1772.68]  So anyway, there's been a lot of things that have just been a little slower and a little
[1772.68 --> 1774.66]  frustrating, but there's been a lot of things that are really good.
[1774.72 --> 1776.92]  And I realized I've been really focused on the frustrating things.
[1777.36 --> 1781.00]  Um, the easy access to the dictation button is amazing.
[1781.00 --> 1784.56]  Uh, regardless of what keyboard you're using, you don't have to like long press anything.
[1784.56 --> 1786.14]  It's completely separate from the keyboard.
[1786.22 --> 1788.58]  It's just down in the bottom and it just works like immediately.
[1788.58 --> 1792.80]  And part of my problem with dictation on this thing is that it's like old and buggy and
[1792.80 --> 1797.10]  just kind of a piece of crap, but that doesn't change the fact that I have absolutely appreciated
[1797.10 --> 1797.36]  that.
[1797.48 --> 1804.52]  I also love the better integration with third party calling apps on Android, like teams
[1804.52 --> 1808.72]  when you're on Android auto, for example, the interface is terrible.
[1808.72 --> 1813.72]  I don't actually think there's a way to hang up a WhatsApp call with my Android phone and
[1813.72 --> 1818.18]  my car when I, when, when, when I'm, when I'm using Android auto, like if I want to hang
[1818.18 --> 1820.94]  up the call, I either have to tell the other person to do it, or I have to like do it on
[1820.94 --> 1822.58]  my phone, which you're not supposed to do.
[1822.88 --> 1828.24]  Uh, whereas on iOS and with car play, the interface, other than just saying, this is
[1828.24 --> 1830.04]  a team's call, this is a WhatsApp call.
[1830.44 --> 1835.00]  It looks exactly the same as a regular phone call, which is something that I really appreciate.
[1835.34 --> 1836.32]  It's a big deal.
[1837.22 --> 1841.00]  Um, care, Kakarato says, Oh yeah.
[1841.06 --> 1842.02]  Does it call Yvonne?
[1842.58 --> 1843.48]  Yes, it does.
[1844.14 --> 1845.52]  Hey, that's a big improvement.
[1845.66 --> 1847.22]  So that's something that's pretty big.
[1847.22 --> 1848.74]  It won't call almost anyone else.
[1848.96 --> 1852.94]  Um, I haven't figured out a fast way to sync my Google contacts with it just yet.
[1853.08 --> 1854.06]  Oh, well that's not it.
[1854.12 --> 1859.78]  So what's funny is my address book is like a, it's like a time capsule from back when
[1859.78 --> 1861.02]  I dailyed an iPhone.
[1861.20 --> 1861.44]  Oh yeah.
[1861.44 --> 1865.08]  So I was like, who are all these, who are all these people?
[1865.08 --> 1868.22]  Cause I've since purged my address book multiple times.
[1868.70 --> 1869.94]  Um, so that's been kind of fun.
[1869.94 --> 1874.44]  It would be kind of neat actually, if there would be a way to be like, I haven't contacted
[1874.44 --> 1880.50]  this person like show me all the contacts that I haven't contacted in over a decade.
[1880.50 --> 1882.72]  So, and then a purge all button.
[1882.72 --> 1884.22]  So I haven't, okay.
[1884.30 --> 1887.52]  I haven't figured out the contact sync thing because it hasn't been a priority.
[1887.64 --> 1888.92]  I'm not saying you can't do it.
[1889.28 --> 1891.88]  Um, but what happened is they appear to have moved it.
[1892.12 --> 1898.24]  So your accounts menu used to be in the settings menu as one of the like top level things.
[1898.44 --> 1899.72]  So you could stop it.
[1899.72 --> 1905.48]  So accounts, if I recall correctly, and I might be gaslighting myself, but I feel like
[1905.48 --> 1907.28]  accounts used to be here.
[1907.60 --> 1911.70]  And so you had all of your like third party accounts and stuff.
[1912.54 --> 1914.44]  Now it's not there.
[1915.26 --> 1923.12]  Um, and I think the way to sync it is to use like the, um, apparently go under the mail
[1923.12 --> 1924.20]  section to find accounts.
[1924.32 --> 1924.58]  Yeah.
[1924.70 --> 1925.58]  That's what I was about to say.
[1925.58 --> 1930.00]  I think the way to sync it is to use the Apple mail app, which I don't use.
[1930.04 --> 1931.12]  I use the Gmail app.
[1931.42 --> 1937.82]  So I have a whole paragraph on this as well, where I was like, if I use Gmail and I had
[1937.82 --> 1943.52]  no intention of using the Apple mail account because of the way they've changed that interface.
[1944.04 --> 1949.64]  Let me know on this, by the way, guys, did it, did it used to, did it used to be there?
[1949.70 --> 1953.04]  Like I imagine it used to, because I could have sworn.
[1953.16 --> 1953.56]  No idea.
[1953.64 --> 1955.40]  It was just in the top level of the settings menu.
[1955.40 --> 1957.40]  There was just an accounts thing.
[1957.96 --> 1960.26]  Sam Phoenix is saying Linus has gaslighted himself.
[1960.38 --> 1961.32]  It has always been that way.
[1961.42 --> 1962.28]  It's always been that.
[1962.40 --> 1962.54]  No.
[1962.98 --> 1964.88]  Frey says, yes, it used to be in the main settings.
[1965.00 --> 1965.20]  Yes.
[1965.88 --> 1966.32]  Fight.
[1966.48 --> 1966.72]  Yes.
[1966.78 --> 1967.70]  There used to be an accounts.
[1967.88 --> 1973.02]  So as someone who hasn't touched iOS in a while, I was able to kind of figure out,
[1973.10 --> 1974.50]  okay, maybe that's it.
[1975.16 --> 1981.98]  But there is no other obvious place to sign into your Gmail account unless you use the
[1981.98 --> 1986.88]  Apple mail app, which was not particularly intuitive to me.
[1987.10 --> 1987.52]  Sorry.
[1987.62 --> 1988.12]  One second.
[1988.70 --> 1988.96]  Yeah.
[1989.70 --> 1994.28]  Kin Deej in Flowplane Chat said, I wrote an automation that texts every contact I have,
[1994.54 --> 1995.84]  have a great weekend.
[1995.98 --> 1998.50]  And then I delete every contact that replies, who dis?
[1998.50 --> 2002.72]  That's actually pretty funny.
[2002.84 --> 2003.06]  Sorry.
[2003.28 --> 2004.70]  How often do you do that?
[2004.70 --> 2005.04]  Yeah.
[2009.88 --> 2013.74]  Apparently it's, you go to, oh my God, this is terrible.
[2014.06 --> 2019.16]  You go to settings, apps, and then mail.
[2019.16 --> 2019.24]  Mail.
[2021.42 --> 2025.38]  And then mail accounts.
[2025.92 --> 2026.60]  Once per year, apparently.
[2027.78 --> 2030.32]  That's how you, that's how you add a system-wide account.
[2030.52 --> 2030.86]  There you go.
[2030.94 --> 2031.92]  That's where they've moved it to.
[2031.92 --> 2033.16]  Isn't that pretty similar to Android?
[2033.70 --> 2034.10]  No.
[2036.10 --> 2037.20]  No, it isn't.
[2039.48 --> 2040.74]  Apparently it's not mail.
[2041.42 --> 2042.10]  Go to, okay.
[2042.42 --> 2044.02]  Oh, oh, well this is so much better.
[2044.02 --> 2050.34]  Okay, so if you want to, if you want to sync your, your contacts, Luke, don't go to your
[2050.34 --> 2050.94]  phone thing.
[2051.06 --> 2051.54]  Not here.
[2052.32 --> 2052.92]  Not here.
[2053.10 --> 2054.00]  Don't edit here.
[2054.18 --> 2055.18]  Don't look for settings.
[2055.36 --> 2057.96]  Oh, uh, how visible was my screen there?
[2058.92 --> 2059.12]  Dan?
[2059.30 --> 2060.02]  Not particularly.
[2060.20 --> 2060.32]  Good.
[2060.50 --> 2060.70]  Okay.
[2061.24 --> 2065.42]  Uh, so if I just go to contacts here, there's no way to do it in here because the Apple way
[2065.42 --> 2069.36]  is that you go into the settings menu, which of course you can't access from the control
[2069.36 --> 2071.18]  center, not even by customizing it.
[2071.18 --> 2078.30]  The fact that they still don't offer you the option to have one of the controls be
[2078.30 --> 2081.36]  the settings menu is mind boggling to me.
[2081.36 --> 2083.04]  Settings, contacts, accounts, people are saying.
[2083.08 --> 2083.32]  Yes.
[2083.52 --> 2083.86]  No, no, no.
[2083.86 --> 2084.08]  I know.
[2084.24 --> 2084.46]  Okay.
[2084.60 --> 2088.94]  So you still can't go to settings here from the control center.
[2089.04 --> 2092.66]  You can't make one of, you can make these things pretty much anything you can imagine
[2092.66 --> 2093.34]  under the sun.
[2093.46 --> 2093.68]  Whoops.
[2093.90 --> 2095.22]  I keep out of control.
[2096.16 --> 2096.86]  Except settings.
[2097.02 --> 2100.52]  Look at all the options I have here, but one of them cannot be open the settings
[2100.52 --> 2100.70]  menu.
[2100.70 --> 2103.92]  You must access the settings through the home screen and through the settings cog.
[2104.06 --> 2109.98]  So then you go apps, contacts, and then contact accounts.
[2110.88 --> 2112.90]  Wait, but it would work in mail too, wouldn't it?
[2113.94 --> 2119.66]  It should work in basically anyone because that should be, that should be an OS wide sign
[2119.66 --> 2119.80]  in.
[2119.98 --> 2122.00]  It's the exact same interface it used to be.
[2122.00 --> 2123.96]  Oh my God.
[2123.98 --> 2124.56]  What just happened?
[2125.38 --> 2126.18]  Hold on a second.
[2126.58 --> 2126.70]  Yeah.
[2126.78 --> 2127.18]  Add account.
[2127.38 --> 2127.52]  Yeah.
[2127.66 --> 2129.94]  This is the exact same interface that it used to be.
[2130.04 --> 2131.70]  It's just that it used to be really easy to find.
[2131.70 --> 2135.52]  You're expecting iOS to work like Android.
[2135.60 --> 2135.98]  No, I'm not.
[2135.98 --> 2138.28]  I'm expecting iOS to work like iOS used to work.
[2139.50 --> 2142.16]  So that's not really that unreasonable.
[2142.88 --> 2143.36]  Actually.
[2145.12 --> 2145.72]  No.
[2145.72 --> 2152.26]  Add a shortcut to control center for settings.
[2152.70 --> 2154.12]  It's not there though, guys.
[2157.42 --> 2159.34]  Use the open app widget.
[2159.62 --> 2160.44]  I don't know what that is.
[2160.80 --> 2161.24]  Jesus.
[2161.24 --> 2166.12]  Just passing on information.
[2166.38 --> 2168.56]  Use the open app widget.
[2168.76 --> 2169.14]  Okay.
[2169.58 --> 2174.20]  I'm assuming there's a widget that opens any app on your phone and then you set that widget
[2174.20 --> 2176.46]  to settings.
[2176.82 --> 2177.10]  Okay.
[2177.32 --> 2177.82]  I'm assuming that's how it works.
[2177.84 --> 2178.20]  Here we go.
[2178.24 --> 2178.44]  No, no.
[2178.48 --> 2179.20]  I'm going to find it.
[2179.24 --> 2179.96]  I'm going to find it.
[2180.28 --> 2182.02]  Is it an accessibility shortcut?
[2182.20 --> 2182.48]  Maybe.
[2184.16 --> 2185.00]  Motor accessibility.
[2185.40 --> 2185.60]  It would be a widget.
[2185.60 --> 2186.08]  Vision accessibility.
[2186.10 --> 2186.66]  Can you add a widget?
[2186.92 --> 2187.62]  I'm working on it.
[2187.66 --> 2188.42]  I'm working on it.
[2189.76 --> 2190.90]  Translate voice memo.
[2191.60 --> 2192.30]  Screen mirroring.
[2192.36 --> 2192.74]  Capture.
[2192.84 --> 2194.28]  I'm sure it's in here somewhere.
[2195.56 --> 2196.32]  Orientation lock.
[2199.68 --> 2200.04]  Here.
[2200.08 --> 2201.04]  I'm tired of you guys calling.
[2201.18 --> 2201.60]  Oh, here we go.
[2201.62 --> 2201.90]  Here we go.
[2201.92 --> 2202.24]  Here we go.
[2202.40 --> 2202.78]  Here we go.
[2203.38 --> 2203.74]  Okay.
[2204.60 --> 2213.46]  So if you want to open the settings menu in the control center, you go down to shortcuts.
[2214.26 --> 2215.00]  Open app.
[2216.92 --> 2219.20]  And you can open the settings app.
[2219.20 --> 2223.64]  You can't be mad at them for having too many options after being mad at them for not having
[2223.64 --> 2224.26]  enough options.
[2224.80 --> 2225.44]  There we go.
[2226.34 --> 2228.38]  Well, I didn't, I didn't say it's too many options.
[2229.26 --> 2233.74]  Settings is not an app to me, but maybe that's, maybe that's me doing it wrong.
[2233.74 --> 2234.16]  Android ism.
[2234.18 --> 2234.50]  I don't know.
[2234.60 --> 2237.32]  I don't think so because settings isn't an app on a Mac.
[2239.34 --> 2239.70]  Okay.
[2239.78 --> 2240.40]  It just isn't.
[2240.44 --> 2241.04]  It's not a Mac though.
[2241.04 --> 2247.08]  I know, but I'm just saying you can't, you can't, you can't point at, you know, a platform
[2247.08 --> 2252.76]  that literally didn't exist when settings was not an app on the Mac and go, oh, well,
[2252.76 --> 2253.86]  that's an Android invention.
[2254.24 --> 2255.80]  That settings is an app or whatever.
[2255.80 --> 2256.04]  Whatever.
[2256.16 --> 2260.02]  Like it's, it's not like Android invented the idea that settings is not an app.
[2260.22 --> 2260.36]  Sure.
[2260.50 --> 2262.00]  I don't mind that too much.
[2262.00 --> 2267.92]  Um, settings was an app prior to Mac OS 10.
[2268.96 --> 2269.88]  Was it really?
[2269.98 --> 2270.76]  Someone changed.
[2270.96 --> 2271.36]  I don't know.
[2271.62 --> 2273.78]  I could have sworn there were settings you could change.
[2274.00 --> 2275.44]  System preferences app.
[2276.70 --> 2277.96]  System preferences app.
[2278.72 --> 2278.96]  Okay.
[2279.36 --> 2280.60]  Settings is an app on the Mac.
[2280.74 --> 2282.66]  That is, that is wild, dude.
[2283.68 --> 2284.90]  It is still an app apparently.
[2285.40 --> 2286.14]  That is wild.
[2286.66 --> 2288.74]  System settings has an icon on launch pad.
[2288.88 --> 2289.52]  It is an app.
[2290.44 --> 2291.16]  I disagree.
[2291.16 --> 2293.36]  So settings is an app on windows.
[2294.18 --> 2294.92]  Is it?
[2296.06 --> 2300.32]  Is it control panel is kind of, can you open it from run?
[2300.54 --> 2301.56]  It's more of a folder.
[2303.08 --> 2305.24]  I'd say it's what is control panel?
[2313.08 --> 2313.92]  Help me out.
[2314.16 --> 2316.46]  I don't know the windows.
[2316.60 --> 2316.76]  Okay.
[2316.82 --> 2317.34]  So windows.
[2317.48 --> 2317.62]  Okay.
[2317.70 --> 2318.30]  So hold on.
[2318.34 --> 2318.66]  Hold on.
[2320.00 --> 2320.68]  Oh man.
[2320.68 --> 2322.16]  See settings in an app is tough.
[2322.26 --> 2327.94]  Cause like here, let's, uh, here, let's, let's, let's screen, let's screen share for a second
[2327.94 --> 2328.12]  here.
[2328.16 --> 2329.20]  I'm just going to make sure this is muted.
[2329.28 --> 2329.50]  Okay.
[2329.82 --> 2330.02]  Okay.
[2330.02 --> 2330.88]  So Linus laptop.
[2331.12 --> 2331.50]  Okay.
[2331.54 --> 2337.42]  So this is settings, but I wouldn't say that this is an app.
[2338.42 --> 2339.22]  You know what I mean?
[2339.22 --> 2340.22]  Is that settings though?
[2340.22 --> 2342.48]  Is that settings though?
[2342.60 --> 2347.74]  Well, I can change settings, but if I click this, that's an app.
[2347.82 --> 2348.74]  Is this an app?
[2350.74 --> 2351.10]  Yeah.
[2352.04 --> 2352.40]  Yeah.
[2352.56 --> 2353.32]  I think so.
[2353.52 --> 2353.86]  Okay.
[2353.98 --> 2354.34]  All right.
[2354.38 --> 2355.98]  Settings isn't settings is an app.
[2356.10 --> 2357.20]  Cause it's just application.
[2358.48 --> 2358.82]  Yeah.
[2358.88 --> 2359.24]  Okay.
[2359.24 --> 2363.44]  So is, so everything's an application then close to it.
[2364.52 --> 2365.12]  Let's see.
[2365.26 --> 2367.58]  Let's see if I can think of something that's not an application.
[2367.94 --> 2370.94]  There's things that aren't an application that you control through an application.
[2372.72 --> 2373.16]  Sure.
[2375.10 --> 2377.38]  Would you consider Explorer an application?
[2378.26 --> 2379.60]  Uh, yeah, you can end the task.
[2380.00 --> 2385.16]  Yes, but you actually, you actually can't because it'll automatically relaunch because there's
[2385.16 --> 2386.58]  so many dependencies on Explorer.
[2386.58 --> 2387.64]  You can still end it though.
[2388.32 --> 2388.64]  Okay.
[2388.68 --> 2389.36]  This is true.
[2390.22 --> 2390.80]  I mean, okay.
[2390.80 --> 2394.14]  So by that logic then, yeah, basically any process is an app then.
[2394.22 --> 2394.64]  Pretty much.
[2395.00 --> 2396.02]  But is it though?
[2396.22 --> 2397.82]  Is any process an app, Luke?
[2397.92 --> 2398.52]  I don't know.
[2398.64 --> 2399.46]  I don't know either.
[2399.56 --> 2403.82]  Uh, I don't actually think so because like, I don't think like the, like the, yeah, the
[2403.82 --> 2404.88]  service hosts and stuff.
[2404.92 --> 2407.62]  I don't know if I would consider those an app, an application.
[2409.74 --> 2411.80]  You can replace Explorer with another shell.
[2411.80 --> 2412.20]  Yeah.
[2412.32 --> 2412.62]  Okay.
[2412.72 --> 2413.02]  Okay.
[2413.02 --> 2416.44]  Settings on phone.
[2416.54 --> 2417.14]  Isn't an app.
[2417.20 --> 2417.52]  What do you mean?
[2417.58 --> 2418.16]  Settings on phone.
[2418.22 --> 2418.90]  Isn't an app.
[2419.22 --> 2419.34]  Yeah.
[2419.40 --> 2422.16]  I don't think being able to end the task means it's an app.
[2422.58 --> 2422.98]  Technically.
[2424.02 --> 2425.50]  Is there a definition for this?
[2425.50 --> 2430.88]  I think if you look up the definition of app, you're just going to find a lot of people
[2430.88 --> 2436.12]  arguing about app versus application and it'll be like 10 years, 15 years old when people
[2436.12 --> 2437.10]  were still mad about that.
[2437.16 --> 2440.24]  Like, I don't, I don't think we're going to find any useful discourse about this.
[2440.72 --> 2442.24]  No, but I just want to see anyways.
[2442.36 --> 2443.16]  Is puffery an app?
[2443.24 --> 2447.78]  Anyway, long story short, long story short.
[2448.34 --> 2448.82]  I am.
[2449.12 --> 2449.58]  Services aren't apps.
[2449.64 --> 2449.78]  Yeah.
[2449.82 --> 2451.92]  I feel that way as well, but you can end them.
[2451.92 --> 2454.42]  I was trying to make my argument on like, you can end the task.
[2454.42 --> 2458.04]  So that doesn't work if services aren't apps.
[2458.20 --> 2458.38]  Anyways.
[2458.62 --> 2459.52]  Long story short.
[2460.28 --> 2464.22]  I have a lot to say about my experience with the iPhone.
[2464.38 --> 2465.06]  He has words.
[2465.36 --> 2465.90]  I clearly.
[2466.22 --> 2471.06]  You got to work with like Horst or someone on it though, to make sure that you're not
[2471.06 --> 2471.90]  just like missing something.
[2471.92 --> 2472.92]  No, no, that's, that's fine.
[2473.06 --> 2474.18]  No, I'm not, I'm not worried about that.
[2474.22 --> 2475.22]  This is rough notes.
[2475.44 --> 2475.60]  Yeah.
[2475.60 --> 2475.76]  Yeah.
[2475.94 --> 2476.00]  Yeah.
[2476.00 --> 2481.44]  Um, let's see if I, uh, man, speech to text.
[2481.62 --> 2489.40]  Oh, dude, the way it like proactively hounds you about apps tracking you and notifications
[2489.40 --> 2495.58]  and stuff is actually amazing because you can 100% configure all that stuff on Android.
[2495.82 --> 2496.70]  No problem.
[2497.02 --> 2501.42]  But the way that it proactively is like, Hey, are you sure you want this?
[2501.42 --> 2502.58]  Are you sure you want notifications?
[2503.98 --> 2507.26]  Here's the ramifications of the data this app is collecting.
[2507.42 --> 2508.30]  Are you sure about that?
[2509.68 --> 2510.52]  Kind of amazing.
[2510.74 --> 2510.92]  Wicked.
[2511.26 --> 2512.24]  Always thought that was very cool.
[2512.36 --> 2512.50]  Yeah.
[2512.84 --> 2513.20]  Outstanding.
[2513.92 --> 2520.30]  Also, uh, Apple and their privacy stuff is like obviously correct.
[2520.42 --> 2521.00]  I don't, I don't remember.
[2521.36 --> 2524.52]  I don't, I doubt this is in the, in the doc today, but I was skimming through news articles
[2524.52 --> 2525.56]  and I didn't read enough of it.
[2525.60 --> 2526.60]  So sorry if this is wrong.
[2526.60 --> 2532.58]  Um, but I think it was like nation state hackers from China or something gained crazy backdoors
[2532.58 --> 2537.34]  to something because, uh, some government agency was like, yeah, we need to have these.
[2537.44 --> 2538.14]  No one else will get them.
[2538.20 --> 2540.44]  And Apple has always been like, uh, yeah, they will.
[2540.94 --> 2544.90]  Um, so yeah, as we've said in the past, they're definitely correct about that.
[2545.86 --> 2550.86]  There, there's some things that are like definitely better about the Apple way.
[2551.20 --> 2554.50]  Um, but I also have an Android phone.
[2554.50 --> 2559.44]  And there are definitely things that are absolutely brain dead stupid about the Apple way.
[2559.84 --> 2567.02]  And, um, the fact that we don't acknowledge this is, uh, I, I, I, I just don't even know
[2567.02 --> 2567.52]  what to say.
[2567.58 --> 2569.38]  Like Luke, here's a, here's an example.
[2569.60 --> 2573.88]  So if I want to get into my like Bluetooth settings, like I really want to get into my
[2573.88 --> 2574.50]  Bluetooth settings.
[2574.56 --> 2575.66]  So I go my control center.
[2575.70 --> 2576.54]  Oh, angle swipe.
[2576.62 --> 2577.06]  I go.
[2577.26 --> 2577.58]  Yeah.
[2577.62 --> 2577.78]  Yeah.
[2577.78 --> 2578.34]  It's from the corner.
[2578.42 --> 2579.32]  You can't do it from the top.
[2579.68 --> 2580.04]  Really?
[2580.20 --> 2580.42]  Yeah.
[2580.56 --> 2582.36]  Well, I'm not, I'm used to that at this point.
[2582.40 --> 2582.68]  Okay.
[2582.76 --> 2583.86]  I don't agree with it.
[2583.86 --> 2586.32]  I think it's kind of stupid, but that's notifications.
[2587.18 --> 2588.22]  That's control center.
[2588.54 --> 2591.60]  Isn't it just the left or right side of the Island?
[2591.82 --> 2592.56]  Not the corner.
[2592.76 --> 2593.38]  I don't think so.
[2593.70 --> 2595.24]  I think it's just left or right side of the Island.
[2595.34 --> 2595.46]  No.
[2596.28 --> 2596.64]  Really?
[2596.80 --> 2596.92]  Yeah.
[2596.98 --> 2598.96]  Look notifications.
[2599.82 --> 2600.14]  Corner.
[2601.52 --> 2601.88]  Yeah.
[2601.88 --> 2603.28]  I, I'm not, I'm not a fan.
[2603.64 --> 2605.14]  I just, I don't, it just seems weird.
[2605.26 --> 2605.84]  I'm not a fan.
[2605.98 --> 2606.34]  It doesn't matter.
[2606.42 --> 2606.94]  I'm used to it.
[2607.02 --> 2607.18]  Sure.
[2607.18 --> 2608.56]  Um, okay.
[2608.68 --> 2609.88]  So I open up my Bluetooth.
[2610.12 --> 2610.98]  I long press my Bluetooth.
[2611.10 --> 2611.88]  I can configure it.
[2611.90 --> 2614.16]  So Bluetooth is one of the main ones that I can interact with right away.
[2614.24 --> 2614.34]  Okay.
[2614.34 --> 2615.42]  So I go to my Bluetooth settings.
[2615.50 --> 2620.44]  Finally, why did it navigate through the menus like that?
[2621.04 --> 2622.32]  Why would it do that?
[2622.32 --> 2627.72]  Like, why?
[2628.06 --> 2629.14]  That seems a little weird.
[2630.02 --> 2630.68]  I don't know.
[2631.00 --> 2631.78]  Oh man.
[2632.60 --> 2632.92]  Yeah.
[2633.20 --> 2636.82]  Apparently Luke, they're saying Luke is right, except I just showed you guys.
[2636.90 --> 2637.58]  I watched him.
[2638.68 --> 2639.56]  Oh, that time it did it.
[2639.76 --> 2641.34]  You watched me do it last time.
[2641.34 --> 2641.84]  I watched you.
[2642.02 --> 2643.20]  Do you just have to be more over?
[2643.32 --> 2645.96]  I thought it was on, on this side of the Island at all.
[2646.08 --> 2647.82]  Well, I'm on that side of the Island and I just did it.
[2648.24 --> 2649.96]  I just brought down the notification shade.
[2650.06 --> 2651.66]  So do you just have to, you just have to be.
[2651.66 --> 2652.26]  Yeah.
[2652.26 --> 2653.34]  You just have to be more over.
[2653.64 --> 2656.82]  I think it makes more sense to be left or right side of the Island.
[2657.00 --> 2664.36]  Not it's, it's 75% of this side of the screen and 25% of the other side of the screen.
[2665.12 --> 2666.28]  Anyways, whatever.
[2668.78 --> 2674.70]  I'm assuming that's because they still want one hand pull down to be able to be done for either one of them.
[2675.32 --> 2677.68]  I guess, but I, there's no way I could.
[2677.82 --> 2680.08]  I'm trying to think of the reasoning and that, I think that makes sense.
[2680.08 --> 2682.18]  There's no way I could reach notifications from there.
[2683.28 --> 2683.52]  Yeah.
[2686.14 --> 2686.46]  Yeah.
[2686.72 --> 2691.90]  I mean, I also don't think I would bother because if I wanted to see notifications, I wouldn't even like unlock it.
[2692.00 --> 2693.22]  I, I would just do that.
[2693.52 --> 2693.70]  Yeah.
[2693.70 --> 2695.20]  What if your, what if your phone's already open?
[2696.70 --> 2697.96]  Uh, yeah.
[2698.18 --> 2700.66]  Would you like quick lock and then check that way?
[2701.18 --> 2708.60]  Getting all the way over there for me though, with one hand, I'd have to have like a pop thing or something, which I would, I would not install on my phone.
[2708.80 --> 2709.98]  I don't, I don't really like the.
[2709.98 --> 2710.84]  I'm not a fan of them.
[2710.88 --> 2712.58]  I like being able to slide it in and out of my pocket.
[2713.00 --> 2713.06]  Yeah.
[2713.32 --> 2715.06]  I find it catches on too many things.
[2716.58 --> 2716.94]  Um.
[2718.64 --> 2721.52]  The swipe was designed like this before iPhones had islands or notches.
[2721.66 --> 2721.88]  Yeah.
[2722.04 --> 2725.64]  But Apple has like a monstrously big and good development team.
[2725.64 --> 2730.86]  And I'm sure they could go, eh, I'm sure it wouldn't take that much effort.
[2731.10 --> 2734.60]  Based on how long T9 dialing took, I'm not actually convinced.
[2735.26 --> 2742.14]  By the way, this thing is causing way more mic interference than just about any other phone we've ever had on set.
[2742.30 --> 2744.42]  Other than my like clearly broken one.
[2744.98 --> 2745.42]  Yeah.
[2746.38 --> 2750.18]  That's been a, that's been, that's, that could be a bit of a problem.
[2750.56 --> 2753.20]  I don't think you guys are hearing it, but it's very annoying for us.
[2753.20 --> 2753.96]  Oh, do they not hear that?
[2753.98 --> 2754.50]  I don't think so.
[2754.50 --> 2754.78]  The buzzing?
[2754.78 --> 2755.70]  Oh, interesting.
[2755.90 --> 2756.24]  If they don't, right Dan?
[2756.54 --> 2758.28]  Um, it might be processed out.
[2758.64 --> 2758.92]  Um.
[2758.92 --> 2759.66]  Oh, they can hear it.
[2760.00 --> 2760.22]  Oh.
[2760.52 --> 2762.98]  Then that's very loud then.
[2763.10 --> 2763.26]  Yeah.
[2763.26 --> 2764.68]  That one was particularly bad.
[2764.70 --> 2764.72]  It's brutal.
[2764.72 --> 2766.12]  I don't think they could hear mine.
[2766.86 --> 2774.08]  It was very quiet and sometimes if no one's talking while it happens, then, um, then that'll get kind of gated out.
[2774.22 --> 2775.52]  We hear it, but it's not very loud.
[2775.60 --> 2775.84]  Okay.
[2776.02 --> 2776.24]  Yeah.
[2776.24 --> 2777.22]  It's loud for us.
[2777.72 --> 2778.70]  We're direct monitoring.
[2778.98 --> 2779.22]  Yeah.
[2779.58 --> 2780.88]  It's like quite loud for me.
[2782.74 --> 2783.14]  Crazy.
[2783.14 --> 2783.58]  Crazy.
[2783.58 --> 2784.02]  Anyways.
[2784.38 --> 2785.00]  Trying to move on?
[2785.18 --> 2785.50]  Yeah.
[2785.64 --> 2786.14]  iPhone done?
[2786.62 --> 2786.86]  Yeah.
[2787.00 --> 2788.76]  Now we talk about how the second video.
[2788.92 --> 2789.96]  I'll be using it for a while.
[2790.12 --> 2790.46]  Oh, yeah.
[2790.52 --> 2792.40]  No, I meant for this part of the show.
[2792.68 --> 2793.10]  What are those?
[2793.14 --> 2794.58]  Are you cheating on your normal ones?
[2796.10 --> 2796.52]  What?
[2797.14 --> 2797.44]  What?
[2797.44 --> 2798.56]  How could you?
[2798.78 --> 2799.74]  We're not allowed to talk.
[2799.98 --> 2800.20]  What?
[2800.74 --> 2804.94]  Why is everyone so, like, interested in talking about whatever snack I'm having?
[2805.08 --> 2810.22]  Before you got here, they were, like, talking a bunch about the new, like, gummies.
[2810.38 --> 2812.52]  Well, you're cheating on your regular.
[2813.74 --> 2815.00]  They're still Welch's.
[2815.62 --> 2816.82]  They're just juicefuls.
[2816.88 --> 2817.78]  They're like fruit gushers.
[2817.92 --> 2818.46]  Still a lady.
[2818.46 --> 2820.46]  Like the...
[2820.46 --> 2826.46]  Okay.
[2826.46 --> 2827.02]  Okay.
[2835.02 --> 2836.30]  And still delicious.
[2836.30 --> 2840.98]  All right.
[2841.08 --> 2841.60]  Anyways.
[2843.14 --> 2844.12]  My man.
[2845.46 --> 2847.28]  You had another video get taken down.
[2848.76 --> 2849.20]  Yes.
[2849.40 --> 2849.90]  How long?
[2849.98 --> 2850.54]  Has it...
[2850.54 --> 2852.44]  Was it a month ago since the last one?
[2852.52 --> 2853.06]  I think so.
[2853.06 --> 2857.02]  So, like, none in basically forever, and then two in a month.
[2857.02 --> 2865.28]  So, sharp-eyed viewers have noticed that our video about CompTIA's A-plus certification exam is no longer available on YouTube or Floatplane.
[2865.94 --> 2876.32]  Without getting into the exact details of why it's been removed, let's talk about some of the reasons that it could be more important than ever to watch our videos immediately when you see them.
[2881.54 --> 2882.98]  Without naming any names.
[2883.58 --> 2883.92]  Ugh.
[2884.44 --> 2885.66]  What a spin, dude.
[2885.66 --> 2892.34]  There are a lot of ways that a video's ability to be on the internet could be threatened.
[2892.88 --> 2892.98]  Yeah.
[2892.98 --> 2907.00]  I think that our perceived permanence, or the perceived permanence of videos on YouTube or of websites on the internet or pages on said websites is a lot higher than it actually is.
[2907.34 --> 2914.08]  So, some examples of ways that videos can be taken down could be copyright overreach.
[2914.08 --> 2918.76]  So, you know, whether something is or isn't fair use...
[2918.76 --> 2922.08]  That's something that would have to be challenged in court.
[2922.26 --> 2928.16]  That's not the kind of thing that is just, oh, yeah, well, it's fair use, and then, yeah, I guess everything's chill.
[2928.70 --> 2933.96]  Until a judge decides that something is or isn't fair use, it's just a defense.
[2933.96 --> 2934.96]  It's an argument.
[2934.96 --> 2935.14]  It's an argument.
[2935.14 --> 2940.64]  And I think that a lot of what we do could fall pretty easily under fair use.
[2940.64 --> 2956.18]  For example, we will, and maybe recklessly, maybe, you know, making an informed, you know, risk choice, we will frequently show, like, copyrighted films on displays that we're reviewing.
[2956.18 --> 2964.74]  From our point of view, we are not negatively impacting the potential market for that film by you seeing a small snippet of it on a display in the background.
[2965.32 --> 2969.08]  We are not using a substantial portion of the work.
[2970.04 --> 2971.46]  Have you ever had a problem with that?
[2971.60 --> 2971.72]  Nope.
[2971.86 --> 2972.46]  I didn't think so.
[2972.46 --> 2978.28]  Well, what we have had problems with is watching trailers and ads on WAN Show.
[2978.46 --> 2979.26]  Yes, constantly.
[2979.32 --> 2980.60]  Which, again, I would...
[2980.60 --> 2981.20]  It's so stupid.
[2981.28 --> 2984.78]  I would make the argument is absolutely fair use.
[2984.96 --> 2987.22]  As media, we are covering it.
[2987.82 --> 2991.48]  It's, if anything, going to have a positive impact on the market for the work.
[2991.96 --> 2997.36]  It's highly transformative in nature, given that we're not just repurposing it.
[2997.42 --> 2998.84]  We are discussing it.
[2998.84 --> 3002.84]  This is not React content where we're just, like...
[3002.84 --> 3005.04]  Or chair streaming.
[3005.16 --> 3007.12]  You know, like, it's not that.
[3008.50 --> 3019.28]  And I would say that, you know, if we were, say, for example, providing commentary on, you know, a class.
[3019.56 --> 3020.82]  Let's use the word class.
[3020.82 --> 3031.28]  If we were providing commentary on a class and in order to do so, needed to get into some of the specifics, I would say that we would probably have a fairly strong fair use defense.
[3031.56 --> 3033.48]  But that would have to play out in court.
[3033.74 --> 3039.70]  And we would have to have both the means and the will to take it to that bitter, bloody end.
[3039.70 --> 3048.62]  Some of the other reasons that a video could be taken down could be, you know, just, like, corporate butt covering.
[3049.14 --> 3058.90]  And that can often take the form of, like, a legal threat or a letter or a, you know, a polite request or, you know, whatever it is.
[3058.90 --> 3060.88]  It can come in various forms.
[3061.40 --> 3068.68]  And in those cases, there may not be any solid legal foundation for, you know, why a request is being made.
[3069.00 --> 3072.82]  But it might just be that, you know, there's things that they don't...
[3072.82 --> 3074.14]  Maybe you don't want to go to court.
[3074.38 --> 3077.34]  Yeah, they don't want people talking about and they don't want people seeing.
[3077.34 --> 3089.66]  And, you know, they feel strongly that, you know, given enough time and given enough resources, they could find a way to make life unpleasant enough that it's just not worth the fight.
[3090.00 --> 3095.94]  And if you have enough time and enough resources in regards to lawyers, you can pretty much always find a way.
[3096.24 --> 3096.42]  Yep.
[3096.88 --> 3103.58]  And I don't know if I want to get into the example that I would have of something like that.
[3103.58 --> 3106.46]  That actually happened in the past before a video was ever posted.
[3107.34 --> 3114.28]  I just don't feel like opening that can of worms because the rule that I made for myself about that particular company is that we just never speak their name again.
[3115.64 --> 3117.22]  So not going to get into that.
[3117.30 --> 3124.96]  But another potential way that a video could go down is not bribery, but just companies paying for problems to go away.
[3125.32 --> 3129.20]  I want to make it very clear about this one that that is absolutely not the case here.
[3129.32 --> 3131.92]  For no amount of money would we take down a video.
[3132.68 --> 3136.78]  But something like this did happen recently with the emulator Ryugen X.
[3136.78 --> 3144.22]  Where as far as we can tell, because it didn't violate Nintendo's intellectual property in any way, it was fully reverse engineered.
[3144.74 --> 3149.12]  Ryugen X appeared to be immune to the same takedowns that took down Yuzu.
[3149.12 --> 3159.04]  But what seems to have happened was the project owner was just offered a bag of money to quietly delete everything and go away.
[3163.84 --> 3165.26]  Our discussion question.
[3165.26 --> 3177.24]  Is it a problem for consumer journalism when companies use copyright protections or other legal tactics to avoid people criticizing their methods and the material they are presenting?
[3177.24 --> 3183.02]  We'll let you guys be the judge.
[3183.28 --> 3186.16]  We'll let you guys have a little discussion in the comments.
[3186.42 --> 3188.74]  In the meantime, what I would like to find out...
[3188.74 --> 3189.48]  We've got to check your cert, dude.
[3189.68 --> 3192.44]  ...is if I am still A-plus certified.
[3193.74 --> 3194.46]  Because this...
[3194.46 --> 3196.16]  So this is from last time.
[3196.22 --> 3197.68]  What's on the screen right now is from last time.
[3197.72 --> 3198.56]  Yeah, this is from...
[3198.56 --> 3199.20]  We need to recheck.
[3199.20 --> 3200.50]  This is from last week.
[3200.90 --> 3202.64]  So here's my certification.
[3202.82 --> 3206.28]  We're going to find out very shortly if I need to burn that or not.
[3206.40 --> 3206.60]  Yeah.
[3213.92 --> 3214.72]  Hold on, hold on.
[3214.82 --> 3215.24]  No, no, no.
[3216.48 --> 3217.34]  Hold on, hold on.
[3218.56 --> 3219.34]  Still active.
[3220.02 --> 3221.72]  What kind of disappointed I wanted to burn it?
[3226.72 --> 3228.56]  I don't think it's going to be active for long.
[3229.20 --> 3233.76]  I can tell you that with a fair degree of confidence.
[3235.04 --> 3237.42]  Maybe the flames will still burn bright.
[3238.02 --> 3254.76]  I believe it is extremely important for people to be able to have transparency into how the certifications that in some cases could even impact the hiring practices of national security agencies operate.
[3254.76 --> 3258.64]  I think that that is an incredibly important thing.
[3258.64 --> 3264.68]  And I think it is a public good that outweighs any other concerns.
[3264.90 --> 3270.96]  I have absolutely no regrets about making the video that we do, that we did.
[3271.20 --> 3274.36]  And for anyone who watched it, I hope you enjoyed it.
[3274.36 --> 3278.64]  But it is down and it is not coming back is all I have to say about that.
[3278.64 --> 3279.06]  From us.
[3279.06 --> 3280.28]  Yes.
[3280.28 --> 3280.32]  Yes.
[3280.68 --> 3286.28]  There has been precedent set in the past that when this happens, people tend to re-upload the things.
[3287.02 --> 3288.46]  Well, they would have...
[3288.46 --> 3289.88]  There's nothing we can really do about that.
[3289.96 --> 3293.90]  They would have already archived it because we did not keep any copies.
[3294.12 --> 3294.30]  No.
[3294.56 --> 3297.60]  So even the source video files, we do not have them anymore.
[3297.60 --> 3297.76]  Oh, okay.
[3297.76 --> 3298.12]  Yeah.
[3298.12 --> 3298.28]  Yeah.
[3298.98 --> 3299.22]  Yeah.
[3300.54 --> 3302.04]  I purged them myself.
[3302.46 --> 3303.16]  Oh, did you really?
[3303.24 --> 3303.44]  Yeah.
[3303.72 --> 3304.54]  Good for you, Dan.
[3304.92 --> 3305.16]  Mm-hmm.
[3305.30 --> 3307.08]  People auto-archive all our stuff, though.
[3307.76 --> 3309.68]  No, I command line gone on.
[3309.68 --> 3311.80]  Oh, I don't mean internally.
[3312.12 --> 3312.38]  Oh.
[3313.62 --> 3316.02]  Well, people have like Plex scripts for float planes and stuff.
[3316.14 --> 3316.32]  Yeah.
[3316.52 --> 3316.92]  Yeah.
[3317.92 --> 3318.32]  Yeah.
[3318.52 --> 3319.14]  Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[3319.14 --> 3320.64]  Like a bunch of people have it.
[3320.98 --> 3323.78]  It's actually kind of inconvenient for our server infrastructure.
[3324.36 --> 3324.68]  Oh, yeah.
[3324.74 --> 3325.52]  We've fixed that.
[3325.58 --> 3326.24]  Oh, we've rottled it?
[3326.42 --> 3326.64]  Yeah.
[3326.88 --> 3327.16]  Nice.
[3327.28 --> 3328.46]  Yeah, we did that like a long time ago.
[3328.74 --> 3328.96]  Nice.
[3329.22 --> 3332.54]  And people didn't notice for a super long time because they're all just running scripts.
[3332.74 --> 3334.98]  So it was still downloaded by the time they wanted it.
[3335.06 --> 3335.28]  Right.
[3335.36 --> 3337.18]  Because like it's not throttled that much.
[3337.40 --> 3340.94]  I had to ask AJ to un-throttle the office.
[3341.36 --> 3341.70]  Yeah.
[3341.74 --> 3343.38]  What were you doing when you did that, though?
[3343.48 --> 3345.00]  You downloaded like a ton of stuff.
[3345.04 --> 3347.26]  I downloaded every single exclusive.
[3347.70 --> 3347.94]  Yeah.
[3348.12 --> 3349.20]  So like, okay.
[3352.06 --> 3353.62]  At once, multiple times.
[3354.80 --> 3355.20]  Yeah.
[3355.20 --> 3356.32]  But that was for work.
[3356.74 --> 3359.06]  So I guess you can hit the data.
[3359.44 --> 3359.66]  Yeah.
[3360.70 --> 3360.92]  Yeah.
[3361.98 --> 3366.94]  Anyway, if you were looking for a way to help us make up for any losses that we might have
[3366.94 --> 3369.36]  incurred for not being able to keep our video up.
[3370.26 --> 3371.06]  Is it time?
[3371.88 --> 3373.12]  You could send a merge message.
[3373.50 --> 3379.02]  And we've got something pretty exciting that you can check out this week.
[3379.02 --> 3381.26]  We did it!
[3381.80 --> 3383.40]  Oh my goodness, man.
[3383.48 --> 3384.94]  Oh, they're here.
[3385.94 --> 3386.42]  They're here.
[3386.56 --> 3388.56]  Look at how happy Dan is.
[3388.62 --> 3390.24]  This is the second time I've smiled.
[3390.48 --> 3390.88]  Look at that.
[3391.08 --> 3391.46]  Oh.
[3391.46 --> 3392.84]  That's crazy.
[3393.00 --> 3393.28]  Oops.
[3393.50 --> 3395.14]  You've never seen Dan the happy.
[3395.92 --> 3396.96]  You never have.
[3397.22 --> 3397.94]  Oh, yeah.
[3398.02 --> 3399.72]  This has been a long time coming.
[3399.94 --> 3401.62]  I'm sorry it took so long.
[3402.00 --> 3403.68]  But this is such a great picture.
[3403.80 --> 3405.38]  He's like, look at this.
[3405.76 --> 3406.88]  You can't see my belt.
[3407.56 --> 3409.12]  It makes the pocket go away.
[3409.22 --> 3409.62]  It's amazing.
[3409.62 --> 3410.44]  It's so nice.
[3410.52 --> 3411.34]  Look, the arms fit.
[3412.32 --> 3413.38]  This is a medium.
[3413.52 --> 3414.56]  There's a medium.
[3414.76 --> 3415.68]  I'm wearing a medium.
[3415.96 --> 3417.06]  You want to see another happy Dan?
[3417.12 --> 3418.20]  Go down to the last photo.
[3418.52 --> 3419.04]  Oh, yeah.
[3419.92 --> 3420.24]  Oh, no.
[3420.58 --> 3421.78]  There's too many photos.
[3421.96 --> 3422.36]  Too far.
[3423.42 --> 3424.78]  Wait, we have long sleeves as well?
[3424.92 --> 3425.74]  I'm wearing one right now.
[3425.76 --> 3427.04]  And it goes to his wrist.
[3427.60 --> 3428.38]  It's a medium.
[3428.38 --> 3429.08]  Look how happy he is about this.
[3429.08 --> 3430.04]  It's a medium.
[3430.54 --> 3430.90]  Amazing.
[3431.56 --> 3432.92]  This has never happened.
[3433.28 --> 3435.98]  I've done the laundry like almost every day this week
[3435.98 --> 3437.72]  because I took home one of these.
[3438.28 --> 3441.02]  And every day I'd wake up and be like, oh.
[3442.78 --> 3443.26]  Okay.
[3443.50 --> 3446.04]  Well, I want to wear it again.
[3446.38 --> 3448.02]  So, yeah.
[3448.10 --> 3451.14]  I just have to buy like a ton of them, I guess.
[3451.38 --> 3452.26]  Pretty exciting.
[3452.86 --> 3453.62]  So, yeah.
[3453.62 --> 3455.72]  We have tall blank T-shirts and long sleeves.
[3455.84 --> 3457.60]  It's our signature blank T.
[3458.62 --> 3460.96]  Improved to fit taller, lankier builds.
[3461.26 --> 3463.16]  Custom made to provide the comfort and durability
[3463.16 --> 3464.38]  that we want in a T.
[3464.38 --> 3466.48]  available with short or long sleeve.
[3466.58 --> 3466.90]  Oh, wait.
[3466.98 --> 3467.76]  That's in there twice.
[3467.84 --> 3468.20]  Well, whatever.
[3468.28 --> 3471.72]  The point is, it uses our tried and true 6040 cotton poly blend
[3471.72 --> 3473.90]  that you can find on most of our printed LTT shirts.
[3474.02 --> 3475.84]  We are slowly rolling these out.
[3476.02 --> 3478.54]  So, the initial inventory is a little limited.
[3478.80 --> 3480.26]  So, if you want them, get them.
[3480.36 --> 3481.30]  It's to gauge interest.
[3481.40 --> 3482.48]  It's only black for now.
[3482.80 --> 3485.32]  But our hope is to expand our tall lineup
[3485.32 --> 3487.62]  in the months and years to come.
[3488.12 --> 3489.42]  Also, for the store this week,
[3489.42 --> 3492.54]  the Tech Sack is finally back in stock.
[3492.54 --> 3496.68]  The five-star reviewed Tech Sack.
[3496.88 --> 3497.32]  Let's go.
[3497.52 --> 3498.96]  Go check out people's reviews.
[3499.66 --> 3502.06]  Great as a diabetic sack, apparently.
[3502.30 --> 3502.96]  Oh, that makes sense.
[3503.06 --> 3504.10]  I never thought about that.
[3504.18 --> 3504.72]  Good to know.
[3504.96 --> 3505.90]  The greatest sack.
[3506.08 --> 3506.98]  So many pockets.
[3507.42 --> 3509.18]  I use it as a toiletries bag.
[3509.26 --> 3509.56]  Me too.
[3510.00 --> 3510.50]  I use it when I travel.
[3510.50 --> 3510.86]  No, not I.
[3511.00 --> 3511.32]  Hold on.
[3511.92 --> 3512.82]  I was reading a review.
[3513.02 --> 3513.24]  Oh.
[3514.32 --> 3515.00]  Where'd it go?
[3515.84 --> 3517.98]  I use it as a toiletries bag for travel.
[3518.36 --> 3518.74]  Yeah, me too.
[3520.22 --> 3520.84]  Thank you, Luke.
[3520.90 --> 3521.44]  Thank you for that.
[3522.00 --> 3523.58]  Anyway, the point is, check it out.
[3523.70 --> 3525.12]  Tech Sack, finally back in stock.
[3526.74 --> 3527.44]  What else is that?
[3527.46 --> 3529.06]  I think that's pretty much it for the store.
[3529.14 --> 3529.76]  So, merch messages.
[3529.90 --> 3530.76]  If you want to leave a merch message,
[3530.80 --> 3531.94]  all you got to do is go to LTT Store,
[3532.00 --> 3532.80]  add something to your cart,
[3532.86 --> 3534.32]  and in the cart, whenever we're live
[3534.32 --> 3535.60]  and accepting merch messages,
[3535.68 --> 3537.06]  there'll be a box for merch messages.
[3537.16 --> 3537.96]  You fill out your merch message,
[3538.02 --> 3538.68]  you place your order,
[3538.94 --> 3540.28]  and it'll go to producer Dan,
[3540.42 --> 3542.18]  who will pop it up down there
[3542.18 --> 3543.38]  so you can shout out your mom
[3543.38 --> 3543.90]  or your girlfriend.
[3544.02 --> 3545.14]  Just kidding, they're not watching.
[3545.34 --> 3546.42]  So you can shout out your dad
[3546.42 --> 3546.96]  or your boyfriend.
[3549.18 --> 3551.40]  Okay, we actually do have women
[3551.40 --> 3552.04]  who watch the show.
[3552.34 --> 3552.58]  Yes.
[3552.66 --> 3553.60]  It's remarkable to me.
[3553.76 --> 3553.84]  Yes.
[3553.84 --> 3554.84]  But they...
[3554.84 --> 3555.68]  Not very many.
[3556.02 --> 3556.96]  And send merch messages.
[3557.22 --> 3558.50]  They're real, and I see them.
[3558.62 --> 3559.14]  I see you.
[3559.34 --> 3559.58]  Thank you.
[3560.36 --> 3561.54]  Anyway, it'll go to Dan,
[3561.58 --> 3562.52]  who will pop it down here,
[3562.60 --> 3563.64]  or who will forward it to someone
[3563.64 --> 3564.42]  who can answer your question,
[3564.50 --> 3565.52]  or who will answer it himself,
[3565.68 --> 3567.50]  or who will send it to me and Luke
[3567.50 --> 3568.82]  as a curated merch message,
[3568.84 --> 3569.88]  and we're going to show you how that works.
[3570.90 --> 3571.96]  Jeremy, I've got a couple here.
[3572.18 --> 3573.12]  How do you guys handle
[3573.12 --> 3574.46]  healthy workplace environments
[3574.46 --> 3577.00]  in a heavily male-dominated industry?
[3577.42 --> 3579.10]  I'm in school for CS
[3579.10 --> 3580.22]  and work in construction
[3580.22 --> 3580.98]  as my day job,
[3581.02 --> 3582.26]  and it can be hard as a woman
[3582.26 --> 3583.58]  being disregarded.
[3583.90 --> 3585.40]  Oh, you mean like socially healthy workplace?
[3585.40 --> 3586.10]  How topical.
[3586.84 --> 3587.08]  Exactly.
[3589.28 --> 3591.68]  I mean, ask questions?
[3592.36 --> 3592.62]  Yeah.
[3592.62 --> 3597.56]  It's not always...
[3597.56 --> 3598.40]  It's not always...
[3598.40 --> 3599.54]  I mean, that's...
[3599.54 --> 3601.42]  That's not always a guarantee.
[3601.92 --> 3602.92]  You can ask someone,
[3603.06 --> 3604.40]  does this work for you?
[3604.76 --> 3606.08]  Are you comfortable with this?
[3606.32 --> 3607.06]  And they might say,
[3607.62 --> 3607.94]  yes.
[3608.08 --> 3609.12]  They might feel pressured
[3609.12 --> 3610.72]  into saying yes in the scenario
[3610.72 --> 3612.52]  if you are like their boss
[3612.52 --> 3613.38]  or something like that.
[3614.00 --> 3615.00]  That's a...
[3615.00 --> 3616.10]  You got to be careful with that line.
[3616.10 --> 3617.26]  I mean,
[3617.38 --> 3618.18]  one of the things
[3618.18 --> 3619.06]  that I like to do
[3619.06 --> 3620.66]  is I will explicitly say,
[3620.84 --> 3622.70]  if not, that's fine.
[3623.50 --> 3624.56]  We'll do this instead
[3624.56 --> 3627.12]  so that there's a clear out.
[3627.26 --> 3628.94]  Give the other option.
[3629.08 --> 3629.90]  I have to confess,
[3630.04 --> 3630.98]  sometimes I'm in a hurry
[3630.98 --> 3633.36]  and I forget to like
[3633.36 --> 3635.50]  do every step.
[3637.28 --> 3637.68]  Yeah.
[3637.84 --> 3638.62]  I don't know.
[3638.72 --> 3639.72]  I mean, I would say...
[3639.72 --> 3641.12]  I would say that
[3641.12 --> 3642.20]  it's not for any...
[3642.20 --> 3643.84]  It's never for any lack of intent.
[3644.66 --> 3645.14]  Or...
[3645.14 --> 3645.74]  Sorry.
[3645.96 --> 3647.52]  It's never for a lack of intent
[3647.52 --> 3649.50]  to make the environment
[3649.50 --> 3651.58]  like good.
[3651.98 --> 3652.82]  But I mean,
[3652.86 --> 3653.18]  this is...
[3653.18 --> 3654.42]  Yeah, this is a great point.
[3654.68 --> 3655.26]  Poison says,
[3655.32 --> 3656.34]  seems weird to ask men
[3656.34 --> 3657.08]  how they manage
[3657.08 --> 3658.66]  like making things better
[3658.66 --> 3659.90]  for women in a male-dominated industry.
[3659.98 --> 3660.38]  I don't know.
[3660.38 --> 3661.08]  All I can really do
[3661.08 --> 3661.74]  is ask questions
[3661.74 --> 3662.70]  because a lot of the time
[3662.70 --> 3664.62]  I just don't fully understand
[3664.62 --> 3665.14]  the challenges.
[3665.82 --> 3666.68]  And I can't
[3666.68 --> 3667.44]  unless you tell me.
[3668.02 --> 3670.78]  And even if one person tells me,
[3670.92 --> 3671.50]  doesn't mean that
[3671.50 --> 3672.06]  that's going to apply
[3672.06 --> 3672.82]  to another person.
[3673.00 --> 3673.90]  You can't...
[3673.90 --> 3674.74]  You can't really...
[3674.74 --> 3675.72]  Like, this is why...
[3675.72 --> 3676.52]  This is why
[3676.52 --> 3678.08]  the entire concept
[3678.08 --> 3678.96]  of, you know,
[3679.10 --> 3680.18]  sexism or racism
[3680.18 --> 3681.70]  is just so fucking stupid.
[3681.92 --> 3682.28]  Right?
[3682.36 --> 3684.28]  Because trying to bundle
[3684.28 --> 3685.04]  individuals
[3685.04 --> 3686.62]  into any kind of bucket
[3686.62 --> 3688.58]  is just a complete waste of time.
[3688.70 --> 3689.32]  You're making assumptions.
[3689.32 --> 3691.34]  You will always be making assumptions.
[3691.34 --> 3692.34]  And so...
[3692.34 --> 3695.70]  I know one of the main things
[3695.70 --> 3696.32]  I've heard
[3696.32 --> 3697.24]  is the whole,
[3697.36 --> 3698.72]  like, people react differently
[3698.72 --> 3700.46]  to the same thing
[3700.46 --> 3702.36]  depending on if it's coming
[3702.36 --> 3704.02]  from, like, a man or a woman.
[3704.14 --> 3704.54]  So, like,
[3704.56 --> 3706.10]  if you try to be assertive
[3706.10 --> 3707.36]  as a man,
[3707.50 --> 3708.68]  people see it as, like,
[3709.06 --> 3709.46]  oh, yeah,
[3709.56 --> 3710.74]  good personality trait.
[3710.88 --> 3711.68]  You try to be assertive
[3711.68 --> 3712.08]  as a woman
[3712.08 --> 3713.40]  and people see you as...
[3713.40 --> 3714.02]  I don't know if I can say
[3714.02 --> 3714.44]  this word or not.
[3714.48 --> 3714.74]  Bitchy.
[3714.74 --> 3716.04]  Um...
[3716.04 --> 3716.64]  Probably.
[3716.82 --> 3717.18]  I don't know.
[3717.72 --> 3718.20]  Um...
[3718.20 --> 3719.20]  Um...
[3719.20 --> 3720.26]  So, I think
[3720.26 --> 3721.12]  just try to be careful
[3721.12 --> 3721.86]  to not treat people differently.
[3721.86 --> 3722.38]  Am I the one
[3722.38 --> 3723.10]  who's always cancelled?
[3724.10 --> 3725.40]  No, I'm saying that's...
[3725.40 --> 3726.06]  Oh, my goodness.
[3726.14 --> 3727.20]  I'm not saying that's a thing.
[3727.76 --> 3728.36]  Um...
[3728.36 --> 3729.24]  I'm saying that's a...
[3729.24 --> 3730.58]  That's a line of complaint
[3730.58 --> 3732.28]  that I have heard...
[3732.28 --> 3732.42]  Yep.
[3732.66 --> 3733.60]  ...people in that sphere
[3733.60 --> 3734.96]  discuss being a problem
[3734.96 --> 3735.84]  at their workplaces.
[3736.06 --> 3737.38]  So, try to, you know,
[3737.46 --> 3738.76]  just treat people the same.
[3738.96 --> 3740.76]  So, if someone's being assertive,
[3741.48 --> 3742.88]  treat that person the same
[3742.88 --> 3744.18]  that you would treat anyone else
[3744.18 --> 3744.70]  being assertive.
[3744.72 --> 3746.92]  So, we have someone, um...
[3746.92 --> 3748.86]  To make this harder to identify,
[3749.30 --> 3749.92]  I'm gonna say
[3749.92 --> 3751.76]  we, at some point,
[3752.04 --> 3753.08]  had someone,
[3753.78 --> 3754.22]  a woman,
[3754.60 --> 3756.18]  in, like, a supervisory
[3756.18 --> 3757.46]  slash managerial...
[3757.46 --> 3759.14]  Basically, who had subordinates
[3759.14 --> 3760.36]  who reported to her.
[3760.98 --> 3761.82]  Um...
[3761.82 --> 3762.78]  And...
[3762.78 --> 3764.82]  And I remember
[3764.82 --> 3766.00]  having to
[3766.00 --> 3767.94]  explicitly
[3767.94 --> 3770.80]  multiple times
[3770.80 --> 3772.08]  make it clear
[3772.08 --> 3773.80]  that my expectation
[3773.80 --> 3774.92]  was
[3774.92 --> 3776.52]  forthrightness
[3776.52 --> 3777.74]  and pushback.
[3779.74 --> 3780.74]  Like, to me.
[3781.44 --> 3782.16]  Um...
[3782.16 --> 3783.76]  And that, like...
[3783.76 --> 3785.30]  Like, that was good.
[3785.94 --> 3786.92]  And anything else
[3786.92 --> 3788.16]  was not good.
[3788.16 --> 3788.58]  Well, because it's...
[3788.58 --> 3789.12]  It's possible...
[3789.12 --> 3789.62]  That's another thing.
[3789.72 --> 3790.02]  It's...
[3790.02 --> 3791.76]  Everyone comes into
[3791.76 --> 3792.74]  every single conversation
[3792.74 --> 3793.16]  ever
[3793.16 --> 3794.10]  with their own
[3794.10 --> 3794.94]  custom baggage.
[3795.48 --> 3795.74]  Um...
[3795.74 --> 3796.56]  So, that person
[3796.56 --> 3797.12]  may have gotten
[3797.12 --> 3797.86]  a lot of pushback
[3797.86 --> 3798.48]  for that type of thing
[3798.48 --> 3798.88]  in the past.
[3798.88 --> 3798.94]  Exactly.
[3798.94 --> 3800.06]  So, you have to try
[3800.06 --> 3800.46]  to make sure
[3800.46 --> 3801.10]  that they understand
[3801.10 --> 3801.70]  that that's, like,
[3801.74 --> 3802.30]  something that you...
[3802.30 --> 3802.60]  Exactly.
[3802.80 --> 3803.36]  I'm not saying
[3803.36 --> 3804.30]  it's a bad thing
[3804.30 --> 3805.70]  that I had to say it.
[3805.82 --> 3806.74]  Well, it is.
[3806.84 --> 3807.72]  It's a bad thing
[3807.72 --> 3808.88]  that this individual
[3808.88 --> 3809.84]  had experiences
[3809.84 --> 3810.42]  in the past
[3810.42 --> 3811.02]  that led
[3811.02 --> 3812.30]  to that
[3812.30 --> 3813.42]  not being something
[3813.42 --> 3814.28]  that they could assume
[3814.28 --> 3815.54]  is their right
[3815.54 --> 3816.26]  in the workplace
[3816.26 --> 3817.22]  to...
[3817.22 --> 3817.88]  to...
[3817.88 --> 3819.28]  give their opinion
[3819.28 --> 3819.94]  in a...
[3819.94 --> 3820.76]  in a...
[3820.76 --> 3822.04]  I wouldn't say,
[3822.16 --> 3823.08]  like, not forceful,
[3823.14 --> 3824.72]  but in, like, uh...
[3824.72 --> 3825.18]  I don't know,
[3825.28 --> 3827.02]  in a confident manner?
[3827.02 --> 3828.02]  In a...
[3828.02 --> 3828.62]  In a...
[3828.62 --> 3829.02]  Assertive?
[3829.34 --> 3830.40]  Yeah, assertive manner.
[3830.64 --> 3832.20]  Because that's totally fine.
[3832.38 --> 3833.46]  And that should be
[3833.46 --> 3834.14]  totally fine.
[3834.86 --> 3835.38]  And you can...
[3835.38 --> 3836.82]  You can say something
[3836.82 --> 3837.46]  assertively,
[3837.60 --> 3838.44]  but still be open
[3838.44 --> 3839.50]  to feedback on it,
[3839.54 --> 3840.22]  if that makes sense.
[3841.06 --> 3841.62]  Yeah, of course.
[3841.62 --> 3842.58]  Like, you can confidently
[3842.58 --> 3843.44]  hold the position
[3843.44 --> 3844.34]  and say it assertively.
[3844.40 --> 3844.56]  Yeah.
[3844.94 --> 3846.06]  And, look, I mean,
[3846.12 --> 3847.20]  something Yvonne tells me
[3847.20 --> 3847.74]  all the time
[3847.74 --> 3849.02]  is that, like,
[3849.08 --> 3849.70]  I...
[3849.70 --> 3851.02]  I...
[3851.02 --> 3852.16]  I tend to
[3852.16 --> 3852.98]  overpower
[3852.98 --> 3854.22]  the conversation sometimes,
[3854.22 --> 3855.24]  whether it's intentional
[3855.24 --> 3855.88]  or not,
[3855.94 --> 3857.60]  by just being confident
[3857.60 --> 3858.42]  in my position,
[3859.16 --> 3859.98]  being kind of loud,
[3860.74 --> 3861.14]  uh...
[3861.14 --> 3862.38]  being kind of energetic
[3862.38 --> 3863.02]  and...
[3863.02 --> 3863.96]  and...
[3863.96 --> 3864.80]  um...
[3864.80 --> 3865.24]  and...
[3865.24 --> 3866.18]  and kind of bombastic
[3866.18 --> 3867.42]  in my body language.
[3868.20 --> 3868.72]  Bombastic.
[3868.84 --> 3870.06]  And so she'll say,
[3870.16 --> 3870.44]  like, look,
[3870.52 --> 3871.44]  whether you're intending
[3871.44 --> 3872.10]  to or not,
[3872.16 --> 3873.12]  you can kind of make it
[3873.12 --> 3874.52]  hard to talk to you
[3874.52 --> 3875.08]  sometimes.
[3875.36 --> 3876.74]  And so, you know,
[3876.80 --> 3877.48]  in those...
[3877.48 --> 3878.92]  in those situations,
[3878.92 --> 3880.04]  it's something that
[3880.04 --> 3880.76]  I have to be, like,
[3880.86 --> 3882.16]  actively aware of
[3882.16 --> 3883.16]  and go, like,
[3883.20 --> 3883.24]  okay...
[3883.24 --> 3885.48]  This is a modern thing
[3885.48 --> 3885.98]  for Linus.
[3886.02 --> 3886.82]  I've seen him do it.
[3886.92 --> 3887.70]  Here's my...
[3887.70 --> 3888.58]  Here's my take.
[3888.84 --> 3889.60]  And this is why
[3889.60 --> 3890.38]  I think we should do it.
[3892.24 --> 3892.64]  But...
[3892.64 --> 3893.44]  Um...
[3893.44 --> 3893.94]  You guys go.
[3894.06 --> 3895.00]  I'm not married to it.
[3895.14 --> 3895.38]  Yeah.
[3896.20 --> 3896.86]  And he'll do that.
[3896.90 --> 3897.54]  He'll sit back.
[3898.62 --> 3899.58]  Because he's, like,
[3899.90 --> 3901.70]  physically removing himself
[3901.70 --> 3902.44]  from the conversation
[3902.44 --> 3903.12]  because if he doesn't,
[3903.20 --> 3904.02]  he can't help himself.
[3907.02 --> 3908.70]  Am I wrong?
[3908.70 --> 3909.70]  Yeah.
[3915.16 --> 3915.94]  It is what it is.
[3916.00 --> 3916.12]  Well,
[3917.26 --> 3918.00]  the thing is that
[3918.00 --> 3918.54]  a lot of the time
[3918.54 --> 3919.66]  the answer is obvious to me,
[3919.98 --> 3920.74]  which is a blessing
[3920.74 --> 3922.22]  because I can come to
[3922.22 --> 3923.26]  the answer really quickly,
[3923.26 --> 3924.56]  but also a curse
[3924.56 --> 3925.86]  because I can be wrong
[3925.86 --> 3926.56]  like anybody.
[3926.92 --> 3927.20]  Yeah.
[3927.76 --> 3928.24]  Um...
[3928.24 --> 3929.18]  And you also
[3929.18 --> 3930.36]  kind of need
[3930.36 --> 3931.60]  everybody to get there.
[3932.20 --> 3932.80]  Um...
[3932.80 --> 3933.72]  And, you know,
[3933.76 --> 3934.42]  in some scenarios
[3934.42 --> 3935.16]  someone might get there
[3935.16 --> 3935.86]  before you do
[3935.86 --> 3936.82]  and other scenarios
[3936.82 --> 3938.26]  you might get there
[3938.26 --> 3938.80]  before them
[3938.80 --> 3940.06]  and you need everybody
[3940.06 --> 3940.58]  to get to
[3940.58 --> 3942.48]  at least a similar spot.
[3942.74 --> 3943.28]  You might not get
[3943.28 --> 3944.20]  a 100% agreement
[3944.20 --> 3945.06]  across the whole board,
[3945.18 --> 3946.20]  but you need everybody
[3946.20 --> 3947.16]  to be...
[3947.16 --> 3947.94]  You need buy-in.
[3948.06 --> 3948.30]  Yeah.
[3948.62 --> 3949.52]  Buy-in is a word
[3949.52 --> 3950.98]  that matters to me a lot
[3950.98 --> 3952.72]  because whether you're talking...
[3952.72 --> 3953.04]  You can disagree,
[3953.20 --> 3953.68]  but buy-in.
[3953.76 --> 3953.92]  Yeah.
[3953.94 --> 3955.08]  If you're talking to a supervisor,
[3955.26 --> 3956.24]  if you're talking to a subordinate,
[3956.48 --> 3957.88]  it doesn't matter.
[3958.40 --> 3960.34]  You need to get buy-in
[3960.34 --> 3960.98]  or you're never going
[3960.98 --> 3961.72]  to get anything done
[3961.72 --> 3963.46]  because they will
[3963.46 --> 3964.72]  either undermine you
[3964.72 --> 3965.62]  or override you.
[3965.86 --> 3966.26]  Yeah.
[3966.32 --> 3967.24]  If you don't have buy-in.
[3967.36 --> 3968.24]  You have to have buy-in.
[3968.32 --> 3968.92]  That's why...
[3968.92 --> 3969.68]  I mean, I've talked about this
[3969.68 --> 3970.28]  on the show before.
[3970.60 --> 3971.34]  Everything is sales.
[3971.52 --> 3972.10]  Life is sales.
[3972.58 --> 3973.46]  You're selling everything.
[3973.58 --> 3974.24]  You're selling yourself
[3974.24 --> 3976.62]  to your potential partner.
[3976.98 --> 3978.04]  You're selling yourself
[3978.04 --> 3981.16]  to, you know, the...
[3981.16 --> 3982.14]  You're selling yourself
[3982.14 --> 3983.04]  to your current partner
[3983.04 --> 3984.56]  hoping you stay together.
[3984.74 --> 3985.02]  Yeah.
[3985.22 --> 3986.06]  It's always sales.
[3986.30 --> 3987.18]  Sales never stops.
[3988.80 --> 3989.86]  You're selling yourself
[3989.86 --> 3990.70]  to, you know,
[3990.86 --> 3991.82]  the interviewer.
[3992.14 --> 3993.08]  You're selling yourself
[3993.08 --> 3994.46]  to the, you know,
[3994.46 --> 3995.64]  the freaking...
[3995.64 --> 3996.88]  The waiter at the restaurant.
[3997.42 --> 3998.88]  Why should they give you
[3998.88 --> 3999.40]  good service?
[3999.52 --> 4000.40]  Why should they...
[4000.40 --> 4001.92]  Why should they pay attention to you?
[4001.94 --> 4003.08]  I know it's their job.
[4003.60 --> 4003.94]  But like,
[4004.40 --> 4005.66]  be a good customer.
[4006.16 --> 4006.32]  Yeah.
[4007.06 --> 4007.32]  Yeah.
[4007.64 --> 4008.64]  Because like the...
[4008.64 --> 4009.04]  I don't know.
[4009.84 --> 4011.32]  I find the easiest way
[4011.32 --> 4013.92]  to have service workers
[4013.92 --> 4015.06]  go above and beyond
[4015.06 --> 4017.04]  when they're serving you
[4017.04 --> 4018.96]  is to just not be
[4018.96 --> 4020.26]  a giant a**hole.
[4021.46 --> 4022.92]  Because they have to deal
[4022.92 --> 4024.06]  with them so often
[4024.06 --> 4025.44]  that if you're just like
[4025.44 --> 4026.88]  refreshing and you're not
[4026.88 --> 4027.94]  rushing them too much
[4027.94 --> 4028.86]  and you're just kind of chilling,
[4029.04 --> 4030.32]  like usually they're super nice.
[4031.14 --> 4032.42]  Because so many other people
[4032.42 --> 4033.30]  are jerks.
[4033.68 --> 4034.56]  Pretty much everyone
[4034.56 --> 4035.66]  in the world is nice
[4035.66 --> 4036.68]  if you're nice to them.
[4036.72 --> 4036.98]  Yeah.
[4037.10 --> 4038.88]  It's a pretty cool life hack.
[4039.00 --> 4040.04]  I mean, there are exceptions,
[4040.32 --> 4040.68]  right?
[4040.88 --> 4041.18]  Sure.
[4041.32 --> 4042.46]  Like there are just, you know...
[4042.46 --> 4043.08]  Maybe they're just having
[4043.08 --> 4044.08]  a horrible day.
[4044.18 --> 4045.00]  Or there's just like...
[4045.00 --> 4046.34]  Filthy racists
[4046.34 --> 4047.34]  and you happen to be
[4047.34 --> 4048.08]  the wrong color
[4048.08 --> 4048.94]  and walk up to them.
[4049.02 --> 4049.20]  Yeah.
[4050.12 --> 4051.02]  You know, like...
[4051.02 --> 4051.58]  Not much you can do
[4051.58 --> 4051.82]  about that.
[4051.82 --> 4052.28]  There's not much
[4052.28 --> 4053.14]  you can do about that.
[4053.88 --> 4054.12]  Yeah.
[4056.68 --> 4057.04]  Yeah.
[4058.64 --> 4059.38]  Don't be addicted
[4059.38 --> 4060.10]  to people who handle
[4060.10 --> 4060.54]  your food.
[4060.70 --> 4060.86]  Yeah.
[4061.12 --> 4061.46]  Yeah.
[4061.58 --> 4061.90]  Yeah.
[4062.26 --> 4062.60]  Yeah.
[4062.60 --> 4063.24]  Or, I mean,
[4063.26 --> 4063.76]  just anyone?
[4065.02 --> 4065.38]  Yeah.
[4069.06 --> 4070.02]  It's just honestly
[4070.02 --> 4072.66]  way less stressful
[4072.66 --> 4073.52]  of a way to go
[4073.52 --> 4073.98]  through life.
[4073.98 --> 4075.56]  All right, Dan.
[4077.08 --> 4078.16]  You got anything else
[4078.16 --> 4078.98]  heavy for us
[4078.98 --> 4079.90]  or maybe something lighter?
[4080.12 --> 4080.74]  No, it's all lighter
[4080.74 --> 4081.30]  after this.
[4081.42 --> 4081.70]  Nice.
[4082.66 --> 4083.76]  Yeah, it was a tough one
[4083.76 --> 4084.18]  to start with.
[4084.28 --> 4084.58]  Start guys.
[4084.68 --> 4085.94]  Like our lanky
[4085.94 --> 4087.58]  tall fit t-shirts.
[4088.36 --> 4089.44]  They're not technically
[4089.44 --> 4089.96]  lighter.
[4090.18 --> 4090.66]  They might even
[4090.66 --> 4091.58]  actually be heavier.
[4091.82 --> 4092.60]  But you can get them
[4092.60 --> 4093.58]  and by getting them
[4093.58 --> 4094.36]  you can support
[4094.36 --> 4095.78]  more shirts
[4095.78 --> 4096.52]  on the store
[4096.52 --> 4097.12]  being made
[4097.12 --> 4098.18]  in tall format.
[4098.34 --> 4099.20]  Not that I have
[4099.20 --> 4099.62]  an agenda.
[4099.70 --> 4100.34]  Yeah, no horse
[4100.34 --> 4101.26]  in this race at all.
[4101.68 --> 4103.20]  Buy 400 of each of them.
[4103.20 --> 4104.22]  That would be cool.
[4105.02 --> 4105.58]  Yeah, then we might
[4105.58 --> 4106.34]  get graphic wands
[4106.34 --> 4107.24]  or other stuff, right?
[4107.50 --> 4107.76]  Yeah.
[4107.80 --> 4108.48]  If these do well.
[4108.70 --> 4109.00]  Yeah.
[4109.60 --> 4110.16]  Let's see.
[4111.02 --> 4112.00]  Something a little lighter.
[4112.72 --> 4113.74]  During the massacre
[4113.74 --> 4114.64]  that happened in...
[4114.64 --> 4115.00]  Oh, no, wait.
[4115.06 --> 4115.34]  Hold on.
[4117.24 --> 4117.80]  I'm...
[4117.80 --> 4120.42]  I'm building a computer
[4120.42 --> 4121.54]  to attach to my TV.
[4121.94 --> 4122.80]  Is there a good way
[4122.80 --> 4123.66]  to have it automatically
[4123.66 --> 4125.16]  wake or turn on
[4125.16 --> 4126.20]  when turning on the TV?
[4126.20 --> 4129.58]  That's a good question.
[4130.50 --> 4130.98]  Does...
[4130.98 --> 4131.50]  Does...
[4131.50 --> 4132.46]  Does C...
[4132.46 --> 4133.04]  What's it called?
[4133.14 --> 4133.82]  C-whatever...
[4133.82 --> 4134.52]  C-whatever C.
[4134.62 --> 4135.90]  What's the stupid
[4135.90 --> 4137.22]  HDMI control thing called?
[4139.08 --> 4139.80]  C-E-C.
[4139.80 --> 4140.16]  I can think of a way
[4140.16 --> 4140.68]  you can do it.
[4140.82 --> 4141.84]  HDMI C...
[4141.84 --> 4142.56]  Is it C-E-C?
[4142.92 --> 4143.52]  I think so.
[4144.16 --> 4144.38]  Yeah.
[4144.64 --> 4145.28]  Yeah, C-E-C.
[4147.98 --> 4149.98]  Does C-E-C work
[4149.98 --> 4152.64]  on consumer graphics cards?
[4153.38 --> 4154.80]  Not that I'm aware of.
[4154.80 --> 4156.18]  Hook up that power switch
[4156.18 --> 4156.90]  to that computer.
[4157.42 --> 4158.72]  Oh, I mean, yeah, you could...
[4158.72 --> 4160.04]  Split the line to an RF signal.
[4160.18 --> 4160.80]  You could go blind
[4160.80 --> 4161.60]  by like a...
[4161.60 --> 4162.14]  Do both.
[4162.30 --> 4162.92]  You could buy like
[4162.92 --> 4164.00]  a universal remote
[4164.00 --> 4164.96]  or something like that.
[4165.04 --> 4165.90]  Like, I've still got
[4165.90 --> 4166.64]  an old Harmony
[4166.64 --> 4168.64]  that is like my one button
[4168.64 --> 4169.96]  power everything on,
[4170.04 --> 4171.58]  but I think they're asking
[4171.58 --> 4172.56]  for C-E-C
[4172.56 --> 4174.32]  and apparently some Intel
[4174.32 --> 4176.00]  nooks supported it.
[4176.58 --> 4177.78]  You need adapters,
[4177.88 --> 4178.94]  but that won't wake it.
[4180.18 --> 4180.62]  Interesting.
[4180.74 --> 4181.44]  I don't know, man.
[4181.50 --> 4182.86]  I mean, C-E-C is such
[4182.86 --> 4184.78]  a flaming pile of garbage
[4184.78 --> 4186.28]  as it is.
[4186.34 --> 4187.26]  Like, even on devices
[4187.26 --> 4188.32]  that support it properly,
[4188.40 --> 4189.08]  I wouldn't imagine
[4189.08 --> 4190.06]  that adding some like
[4190.06 --> 4190.90]  weird accessory
[4190.90 --> 4192.78]  that like has HDMI
[4192.78 --> 4193.48]  pass-through
[4193.48 --> 4194.46]  and can also like
[4194.46 --> 4195.84]  plug in an Ethernet cable
[4195.84 --> 4196.76]  with a magic packet
[4196.76 --> 4197.04]  or something.
[4197.16 --> 4197.92]  Like, I wouldn't imagine
[4197.92 --> 4200.04]  that's gonna work.
[4202.16 --> 4203.82]  I have a Switch bot
[4203.82 --> 4205.24]  that presses the button
[4205.24 --> 4206.78]  connected to Home Assistant.
[4206.94 --> 4207.92]  Yeah, the fact that
[4207.92 --> 4209.28]  that is the solution
[4209.28 --> 4210.54]  tells me everything
[4210.54 --> 4211.30]  I need to know.
[4211.30 --> 4212.14]  I remember with
[4212.14 --> 4212.98]  the Fallout bomb,
[4213.16 --> 4214.16]  I just split it
[4214.16 --> 4215.44]  so that it played
[4215.44 --> 4217.14]  the like toy bomb sound
[4217.14 --> 4218.48]  and turned the computer on.
[4220.70 --> 4222.04]  So you just make it do both.
[4223.18 --> 4224.84]  So you open up your TV.
[4225.54 --> 4225.74]  No, the controller.
[4225.74 --> 4227.20]  You find the power switch circuit.
[4227.26 --> 4227.48]  The controller.
[4227.70 --> 4229.08]  You splice your computer
[4229.08 --> 4230.30]  power switch into it.
[4230.36 --> 4230.88]  You're pressing,
[4231.06 --> 4233.48]  you're pressing the power switch
[4233.48 --> 4234.24]  on your TV.
[4234.46 --> 4235.62]  They're using a controller, right?
[4235.62 --> 4238.54]  You can open that controller up.
[4239.24 --> 4242.08]  Um, that is a terrible solution.
[4242.24 --> 4242.96]  Oh, it's awesome.
[4243.74 --> 4245.20]  I like the way Luke works.
[4245.84 --> 4246.94]  Man, after my own heart.
[4248.52 --> 4249.50]  It's totally doable.
[4249.70 --> 4250.64]  Got a string attached
[4250.64 --> 4251.22]  to the breaker
[4251.22 --> 4252.04]  for the living room.
[4253.54 --> 4254.98]  Hot glue the power button
[4254.98 --> 4255.98]  down on the PC.
[4256.80 --> 4257.54]  Danthony says,
[4257.64 --> 4258.54]  it works on Linux.
[4259.04 --> 4260.00]  Sure, but I don't have
[4260.00 --> 4261.52]  three days to learn
[4261.52 --> 4262.06]  how to do it.
[4262.18 --> 4263.84]  So that's tough.
[4264.42 --> 4265.34]  That's pretty tough.
[4266.18 --> 4266.58]  Um,
[4267.16 --> 4268.02]  I turn on my TV
[4268.02 --> 4268.92]  and use moonlight
[4268.92 --> 4269.92]  to wake up my PC.
[4270.02 --> 4270.98]  Yeah, there's lots of,
[4271.22 --> 4272.82]  there's lots of different ways
[4272.82 --> 4273.68]  and none of them
[4273.68 --> 4274.52]  are what you were asking.
[4274.68 --> 4276.36]  So I think the answer is no.
[4278.18 --> 4279.42]  It's kind of looking that way.
[4279.48 --> 4279.88]  I'm sorry.
[4280.32 --> 4280.72]  Unless.
[4280.86 --> 4281.76]  A wire running
[4281.76 --> 4282.40]  from the remote
[4282.40 --> 4283.06]  to the computer.
[4283.18 --> 4284.60]  Okay, that would be hilarious.
[4284.72 --> 4285.68]  That would definitely work though.
[4285.70 --> 4287.04]  So you actually just like,
[4287.16 --> 4288.88]  when you press that button,
[4289.00 --> 4290.78]  you like put two leads on it
[4290.78 --> 4291.34]  that are just,
[4291.44 --> 4292.06]  they just short
[4292.06 --> 4293.36]  and turn on the computer.
[4293.50 --> 4294.46]  How about a foot switch
[4294.46 --> 4295.74]  underneath the couch?
[4295.86 --> 4296.56]  The problem is
[4296.56 --> 4297.66]  with anything like that.
[4297.98 --> 4299.00]  Because it's a momentary,
[4299.12 --> 4300.62]  like, like short, right?
[4301.02 --> 4301.42]  Yeah.
[4301.62 --> 4302.86]  I turn my computers on
[4302.86 --> 4304.14]  with the screwdriver
[4304.14 --> 4304.76]  all the time.
[4304.92 --> 4305.66]  That's actually not bad.
[4305.70 --> 4307.10]  You could just get another remote
[4307.10 --> 4307.96]  for your computer.
[4308.22 --> 4309.48]  Silverstone has that little remote kit.
[4309.48 --> 4310.68]  You could do a clapper,
[4311.10 --> 4311.40]  you know,
[4311.44 --> 4312.72]  to turn the lights on and off
[4312.72 --> 4314.56]  and it closes the switch
[4314.56 --> 4316.18]  for the PC.
[4316.44 --> 4318.00]  You do like a really sick goal
[4318.00 --> 4318.66]  in Rocket League
[4318.66 --> 4319.54]  and cheer for yourself
[4319.54 --> 4320.86]  and your computer turns off.
[4321.26 --> 4322.02]  Just turns off,
[4322.26 --> 4322.82]  just hibernates.
[4322.90 --> 4323.60]  Well, you could disable
[4323.60 --> 4324.30]  the power button
[4324.30 --> 4325.38]  to like close down
[4325.38 --> 4326.58]  in Windows.
[4326.76 --> 4327.42]  I vote for this.
[4327.78 --> 4328.30]  I use,
[4328.56 --> 4329.62]  that looks like great.
[4330.12 --> 4330.46]  Yeah.
[4331.22 --> 4332.02]  For my lighthouses,
[4332.22 --> 4334.48]  I have those like remote things.
[4334.58 --> 4334.74]  Yeah.
[4334.74 --> 4336.44]  So you got to pull this apart.
[4336.60 --> 4337.46]  Hot glue it to the back
[4337.46 --> 4338.12]  of the other remote.
[4338.14 --> 4338.74]  And take the burn from inside
[4338.74 --> 4340.12]  the controller
[4340.12 --> 4341.50]  and put it in,
[4341.98 --> 4342.98]  in your TV remote,
[4343.12 --> 4344.24]  which is somehow big enough
[4344.24 --> 4344.82]  to house this.
[4344.90 --> 4345.48]  Don't worry about it.
[4346.44 --> 4347.50]  So you 3D print
[4347.50 --> 4349.08]  a new TV remote housing.
[4349.86 --> 4350.02]  Yeah.
[4350.02 --> 4350.80]  Yeah, that sounds like
[4350.80 --> 4351.66]  even more work
[4351.66 --> 4352.82]  than a lot of the other stuff.
[4352.92 --> 4353.82]  Now I want to do this.
[4353.90 --> 4354.68]  That's awesome.
[4354.86 --> 4355.60]  Oh my God.
[4356.98 --> 4357.94]  Weekend project,
[4358.18 --> 4358.54]  I'll, uh,
[4358.96 --> 4360.36]  I'll have done,
[4360.64 --> 4361.32]  It's all home weekend.
[4361.60 --> 4362.36]  Half finished
[4362.36 --> 4363.78]  and then I won't be able
[4363.78 --> 4365.32]  to use any of my living rooms.
[4368.24 --> 4369.52]  Sounds like a pretty good weekend.
[4369.86 --> 4370.96]  Who needs your living room
[4370.96 --> 4371.82]  when you have this project
[4371.82 --> 4373.26]  to pay attention to?
[4373.32 --> 4374.04]  You've just described
[4374.04 --> 4375.54]  the last 15 years of my life.
[4375.66 --> 4376.36]  It could be like,
[4376.38 --> 4377.86]  uh, Sebastian's room.
[4378.20 --> 4379.02]  If you guys watched
[4379.02 --> 4380.88]  the fantastic video,
[4381.32 --> 4382.40]  Sebastian's, uh,
[4382.42 --> 4383.72]  AMD ultimate upgrade thing,
[4384.16 --> 4384.70]  um,
[4384.82 --> 4385.92]  where he has
[4385.92 --> 4387.26]  10 million projects going on,
[4387.30 --> 4388.28]  but it doesn't look like it.
[4388.90 --> 4389.98]  That was very impressive.
[4389.98 --> 4393.56]  I think he might've tied it up
[4393.56 --> 4394.28]  a little bit for us.
[4394.48 --> 4394.80]  Maybe.
[4395.98 --> 4396.38]  Maybe.
[4397.92 --> 4398.72]  Question for you.
[4398.96 --> 4399.18]  Hmm.
[4400.30 --> 4401.36]  I asked you to watch
[4401.36 --> 4402.24]  a particular video
[4402.24 --> 4402.82]  on the channel.
[4403.64 --> 4404.62]  Did you watch it?
[4406.16 --> 4406.82]  What video?
[4407.20 --> 4408.12]  I don't remember this at all.
[4408.58 --> 4409.50]  How to get a $500
[4409.50 --> 4410.84]  motherboard for 50 bucks.
[4411.70 --> 4412.06]  Oh yeah.
[4412.24 --> 4412.98]  The motherboard resurrection.
[4412.98 --> 4413.86]  That was awesome.
[4414.00 --> 4414.44]  That was like,
[4414.52 --> 4415.80]  that was a sick video.
[4416.02 --> 4416.74]  I didn't remember
[4416.74 --> 4417.70]  that you even asked me to.
[4417.70 --> 4419.26]  I happily watched
[4419.26 --> 4420.00]  the whole thing.
[4420.14 --> 4420.74]  That was probably
[4420.74 --> 4422.30]  the most fun I've had
[4422.30 --> 4423.10]  shooting a video
[4423.10 --> 4424.92]  in a very long time.
[4425.14 --> 4426.42]  Genuinely very entertaining
[4426.42 --> 4426.88]  to watch.
[4426.98 --> 4428.20]  Absolutely stuff that like,
[4428.44 --> 4429.70]  I think it has the,
[4429.84 --> 4430.08]  you know,
[4430.12 --> 4430.90]  the spirit of why
[4430.90 --> 4431.40]  we started doing
[4431.40 --> 4432.04]  Scrapyard Wars
[4432.04 --> 4432.62]  where it's like,
[4433.30 --> 4433.86]  you're finding,
[4434.20 --> 4435.78]  watching the value ticker.
[4435.92 --> 4437.84]  We have had historically
[4437.84 --> 4439.88]  a problem of our videos
[4439.88 --> 4441.20]  having like trackable
[4441.20 --> 4441.96]  elements in them
[4441.96 --> 4443.34]  and being able to watch
[4443.34 --> 4443.56]  like,
[4443.60 --> 4444.78]  like Alex updating you
[4444.78 --> 4446.10]  with like how much money
[4446.10 --> 4446.60]  you've saved
[4446.60 --> 4447.28]  versus how much money
[4447.28 --> 4447.58]  you spent.
[4447.58 --> 4448.16]  As you go through
[4448.16 --> 4449.48]  was mind blowing.
[4449.68 --> 4450.12]  The,
[4450.26 --> 4451.64]  the level of,
[4451.78 --> 4452.80]  wow,
[4452.84 --> 4454.78]  that board is mangled
[4454.78 --> 4455.84]  and then you were able
[4455.84 --> 4456.50]  to fix it
[4456.50 --> 4457.90]  was mind blowing.
[4457.90 --> 4460.40]  And the lack of expense
[4460.40 --> 4461.78]  in the things required
[4461.78 --> 4462.52]  to fix it.
[4462.64 --> 4462.78]  Yeah.
[4462.82 --> 4463.04]  That,
[4463.18 --> 4463.40]  that,
[4463.54 --> 4464.10]  uh,
[4464.14 --> 4464.46]  whatever.
[4464.78 --> 4464.90]  Microscope.
[4465.02 --> 4465.24]  Yeah.
[4465.36 --> 4465.92]  That thing.
[4466.00 --> 4466.60]  It's like a hundred bucks.
[4466.88 --> 4467.16]  Under,
[4467.22 --> 4467.74]  under a hundred bucks.
[4467.74 --> 4468.50]  I think it was 70
[4468.50 --> 4469.02]  or something.
[4469.22 --> 4469.36]  Yeah.
[4469.36 --> 4470.10]  By the time you pay
[4470.10 --> 4470.86]  shipping and taxes,
[4471.00 --> 4472.06]  it's still under a hundred bucks.
[4472.06 --> 4472.84]  That's not cheap,
[4472.88 --> 4474.52]  but you buy a broken board,
[4474.64 --> 4475.68]  you buy that,
[4475.78 --> 4476.64]  you fix it.
[4476.64 --> 4478.02]  Now you have this tool
[4478.02 --> 4478.60]  permanently.
[4478.60 --> 4479.08]  Yeah.
[4479.16 --> 4480.48]  And you just saved money
[4480.48 --> 4480.98]  on the board.
[4481.08 --> 4481.24]  Yeah.
[4481.28 --> 4482.42]  It was still cheaper.
[4482.70 --> 4484.04]  That was super cool.
[4484.38 --> 4485.60]  There's been a bunch of videos
[4485.60 --> 4486.30]  that have come out lately
[4486.30 --> 4487.56]  that I've just organically
[4487.56 --> 4489.16]  wanted to click on
[4489.16 --> 4490.70]  and watched the whole thing
[4490.70 --> 4491.06]  and was like,
[4491.14 --> 4491.28]  wow,
[4491.32 --> 4492.10]  that was really good.
[4492.90 --> 4494.10]  You guys have been doing great.
[4494.16 --> 4494.28]  Well,
[4494.28 --> 4494.62]  thanks.
[4494.84 --> 4495.04]  Yeah.
[4495.04 --> 4495.48]  Yeah.
[4496.48 --> 4496.88]  No,
[4496.94 --> 4497.36]  that was,
[4497.46 --> 4498.56]  that was a lot of fun
[4498.56 --> 4499.82]  and the editors have been doing
[4499.82 --> 4500.54]  a great job.
[4500.62 --> 4501.86]  They've been putting in the extra,
[4502.20 --> 4503.62]  they've been putting in the extra effort
[4503.62 --> 4504.14]  on those,
[4504.26 --> 4504.72]  like you said,
[4504.78 --> 4505.74]  those trackable elements.
[4505.90 --> 4507.00]  I think that was way better
[4507.00 --> 4507.92]  in Scrapyard Wars 9
[4507.92 --> 4508.68]  than previous ones.
[4508.68 --> 4508.96]  Yes.
[4509.22 --> 4510.30]  Like tracking the budgets
[4510.30 --> 4511.52]  and like what deals
[4511.52 --> 4512.36]  we're working on.
[4512.76 --> 4513.70]  That was one of the reasons
[4513.70 --> 4514.96]  that first of all,
[4515.08 --> 4515.92]  the first one was,
[4516.02 --> 4516.74]  was delayed.
[4516.92 --> 4518.18]  And then second of all,
[4518.28 --> 4519.84]  one of the middle episodes
[4519.84 --> 4520.64]  was delayed
[4520.64 --> 4522.20]  because I basically sent it back
[4522.20 --> 4522.78]  and I was like,
[4523.86 --> 4524.16]  guys,
[4524.24 --> 4525.42]  you've done a great job
[4525.42 --> 4526.96]  with the time that you had.
[4528.16 --> 4529.02]  Here's more time.
[4529.92 --> 4531.26]  Go do a greater job
[4531.26 --> 4532.06]  because it,
[4532.06 --> 4532.12]  it,
[4532.12 --> 4532.98]  it needs that.
[4533.10 --> 4534.28]  And there's another one
[4534.28 --> 4535.08]  coming soon
[4535.08 --> 4537.38]  that was also sent back
[4537.38 --> 4538.62]  to the kitchen for,
[4539.10 --> 4539.46]  uh,
[4539.46 --> 4540.68]  I asked for about 10 minutes
[4540.68 --> 4541.74]  to be removed from it.
[4541.84 --> 4543.38]  And then I also asked
[4543.38 --> 4544.16]  for the tracking
[4544.16 --> 4544.80]  to be,
[4544.88 --> 4545.94]  to be updated a little bit.
[4546.02 --> 4546.84]  So it was a little clearer
[4546.84 --> 4547.88]  what people are talking about.
[4548.00 --> 4549.42]  But the good news
[4549.42 --> 4550.50]  is that the final cut
[4550.50 --> 4551.44]  is awesome.
[4551.44 --> 4552.28]  Um,
[4552.34 --> 4552.50]  they,
[4552.60 --> 4553.60]  they finally did it.
[4553.98 --> 4554.98]  You know how we've talked
[4554.98 --> 4555.78]  a thousand times
[4555.78 --> 4556.78]  and I've rejected the idea
[4556.78 --> 4557.64]  a thousand times
[4557.64 --> 4558.42]  about doing like
[4558.42 --> 4559.50]  a PC build challenge
[4559.50 --> 4561.26]  just instead of going out
[4561.26 --> 4561.80]  and buying stuff,
[4561.88 --> 4562.86]  just using our warehouse.
[4563.36 --> 4564.24]  See who can build
[4564.24 --> 4564.84]  the best PC
[4564.84 --> 4565.72]  out of like the parts
[4565.72 --> 4566.30]  we have here.
[4566.74 --> 4568.78]  So credit to David,
[4568.96 --> 4569.96]  he came up with a way
[4569.96 --> 4570.88]  to make it not stupid.
[4571.14 --> 4571.42]  Okay.
[4571.50 --> 4571.94]  Cause you know how
[4571.94 --> 4573.10]  my response was always like,
[4573.20 --> 4573.36]  well,
[4573.58 --> 4573.84]  okay,
[4573.84 --> 4574.36]  it's just,
[4574.74 --> 4575.72]  it's just like,
[4575.76 --> 4577.30]  go get the best thing.
[4577.30 --> 4577.92]  Like that's not,
[4578.08 --> 4578.80]  that's not a challenge.
[4578.80 --> 4579.78]  There's no way to win.
[4579.86 --> 4580.50]  There's no way to lose.
[4580.50 --> 4582.60]  You just get stuff
[4582.60 --> 4583.30]  and build a computer.
[4583.38 --> 4583.90]  It's not relatable.
[4584.32 --> 4585.52]  Is it all broken things?
[4585.90 --> 4586.80]  They had no internet.
[4587.62 --> 4588.02]  Okay.
[4588.14 --> 4588.80]  So they weren't allowed
[4588.80 --> 4589.72]  to look up pricing
[4589.72 --> 4590.68]  or information
[4590.68 --> 4591.56]  or specs or anything.
[4592.22 --> 4594.00]  They had a $1,000 budget
[4594.00 --> 4594.76]  with penalties
[4594.76 --> 4595.72]  for going over.
[4597.04 --> 4597.90]  And the goal
[4597.90 --> 4598.48]  was to build,
[4599.04 --> 4599.82]  do they have to guess
[4599.82 --> 4600.40]  the price?
[4600.56 --> 4600.74]  Yeah.
[4600.74 --> 4602.06]  So it was,
[4602.14 --> 4602.66]  it was an,
[4602.88 --> 4604.02]  are we out of touch video?
[4604.96 --> 4605.78]  So they had to,
[4605.88 --> 4606.60]  that's a pretty good angle.
[4606.64 --> 4607.62]  They had to know the price
[4607.62 --> 4609.00]  with no internet access.
[4609.24 --> 4609.46]  Wow.
[4609.54 --> 4610.70]  And then they had to,
[4610.94 --> 4611.56]  sorry,
[4611.62 --> 4612.48]  what was the third thing?
[4612.62 --> 4613.80]  That no internet,
[4614.30 --> 4614.84]  they had to,
[4614.92 --> 4615.14]  oh yeah,
[4615.20 --> 4615.64]  and they had to have
[4615.64 --> 4616.78]  the best performance possible.
[4617.56 --> 4618.72]  So the best performance,
[4619.04 --> 4620.04]  don't go over budget.
[4620.28 --> 4622.14]  You can't research online.
[4622.34 --> 4623.04]  So it was like,
[4623.52 --> 4623.84]  oh,
[4624.08 --> 4625.20]  and to get parts
[4625.20 --> 4626.38]  because there's a lot of things
[4626.38 --> 4627.28]  we only have one of,
[4627.44 --> 4628.58]  it was a draft system.
[4629.06 --> 4630.84]  So they were given 45 seconds,
[4631.72 --> 4633.44]  team one to go grab a part,
[4633.96 --> 4635.30]  team two to go grab a part,
[4635.42 --> 4636.34]  team three to go grab a part,
[4636.50 --> 4637.64]  then team three goes again,
[4637.88 --> 4638.48]  then team two,
[4638.74 --> 4639.40]  then team one.
[4640.34 --> 4642.22]  And so there were cases
[4642.22 --> 4644.16]  where someone got them.
[4644.16 --> 4644.70]  They wanted something that was gone.
[4644.80 --> 4645.90]  Someone got the board I wanted.
[4646.34 --> 4647.72]  It should be really good.
[4647.84 --> 4648.28]  I think the,
[4648.48 --> 4650.06]  I think David and I talked about it
[4650.06 --> 4651.34]  and we agree
[4651.34 --> 4653.68]  that the original like 32
[4653.68 --> 4656.20]  or 35 minute cut is good.
[4656.94 --> 4657.88]  But my issue
[4657.88 --> 4659.10]  when I talked to him about it
[4659.10 --> 4659.40]  was like,
[4659.46 --> 4659.64]  look,
[4660.34 --> 4662.70]  there's two great videos here.
[4663.08 --> 4664.64]  There's one that is super driven
[4664.64 --> 4665.40]  by personality
[4665.40 --> 4667.42]  and there's one that is super nuts
[4667.42 --> 4668.34]  and bolts on the hardware.
[4669.72 --> 4671.20]  There's only room for one video
[4671.20 --> 4671.78]  on the,
[4671.86 --> 4672.60]  in the YouTube cut.
[4672.68 --> 4673.82]  It's got to be one or the other.
[4674.04 --> 4675.86]  And so that's why we ended up
[4675.86 --> 4676.46]  and I kind of went,
[4676.54 --> 4677.14]  which one is it?
[4677.38 --> 4677.72]  Yeah,
[4677.76 --> 4678.84]  it's the personality one.
[4678.90 --> 4679.32]  It's the,
[4679.42 --> 4680.86]  it's the engaging,
[4681.30 --> 4682.42]  fun version.
[4682.42 --> 4684.32]  So what I think is going to happen
[4684.32 --> 4685.66]  is I think we're going to get
[4685.66 --> 4686.10]  the,
[4686.10 --> 4687.16]  the,
[4687.16 --> 4688.74]  the YouTube cut on YouTube
[4688.74 --> 4689.76]  and I think we're going to get
[4689.76 --> 4691.78]  like the David Snyder cut.
[4692.12 --> 4692.56]  Nice.
[4692.72 --> 4693.50]  On float plane.
[4693.66 --> 4693.92]  Nice.
[4694.84 --> 4695.28]  Sick.
[4695.84 --> 4696.66]  So I think that's,
[4696.72 --> 4697.16]  I think that,
[4697.24 --> 4698.44]  I think that's the right way
[4698.44 --> 4700.74]  to kind of not have that footage
[4700.74 --> 4702.50]  just lost to the ether.
[4703.12 --> 4703.56]  Um,
[4704.18 --> 4705.64]  have people be able to enjoy it
[4705.64 --> 4707.54]  because there is a little bit more
[4707.54 --> 4708.90]  analysis
[4708.90 --> 4710.50]  and thought process
[4710.50 --> 4711.66]  behind some of the parts,
[4711.80 --> 4713.46]  but sometimes I was just like,
[4713.50 --> 4714.30]  I was watching it
[4714.30 --> 4714.50]  and I,
[4714.58 --> 4716.24]  like I could feel myself tuning out
[4716.24 --> 4717.08]  because of how many,
[4717.22 --> 4718.04]  you know,
[4718.22 --> 4720.40]  first word latency,
[4721.20 --> 4721.80]  uh,
[4721.94 --> 4724.54]  balancing act of the CL,
[4724.88 --> 4725.18]  whatever,
[4725.36 --> 4726.82]  like not that,
[4726.90 --> 4727.84]  but I was just trying to come up
[4727.84 --> 4728.92]  with something that was kind of jargony,
[4729.04 --> 4730.62]  but basically just a lot of
[4730.62 --> 4732.84]  wiffle waffling
[4732.84 --> 4734.48]  about which one to get
[4734.48 --> 4734.88]  and,
[4734.88 --> 4735.04]  and,
[4735.04 --> 4735.68]  and discussion.
[4735.68 --> 4737.74]  And if you are super,
[4737.86 --> 4738.22]  super,
[4738.22 --> 4739.18]  super techie,
[4739.30 --> 4740.74]  it'll be really interesting.
[4741.04 --> 4743.12]  But for the other
[4743.12 --> 4744.72]  two million people
[4744.72 --> 4745.78]  that are going to watch the video,
[4745.84 --> 4746.66]  I think it's just,
[4746.74 --> 4747.72]  it's not that engaging.
[4747.72 --> 4748.74]  So we had to,
[4748.84 --> 4749.96]  we had to
[4749.96 --> 4751.42]  give her the old
[4751.42 --> 4753.48]  anyway,
[4754.76 --> 4756.36]  Kaboom Pau says,
[4756.42 --> 4758.02]  I've never heard so much joy
[4758.02 --> 4758.74]  out of Linus
[4758.74 --> 4760.46]  than in that motherboard repair video.
[4760.72 --> 4762.78]  This man loves getting some deals.
[4762.90 --> 4763.54]  That's part of the reason
[4763.54 --> 4764.68]  why it was fun to watch though.
[4764.68 --> 4766.14]  It was like you clearly cared
[4766.14 --> 4767.56]  and really wanted
[4767.56 --> 4769.08]  to make every one of them work.
[4769.20 --> 4769.34]  Dude.
[4769.46 --> 4770.30]  Which mirrors
[4770.30 --> 4771.90]  how you would feel
[4771.90 --> 4772.76]  if you were actually
[4772.76 --> 4773.72]  just doing this.
[4773.74 --> 4773.90]  Dude,
[4774.10 --> 4775.32]  making every one of them work
[4775.32 --> 4776.60]  was not the goal.
[4777.46 --> 4778.78]  That was not the plan.
[4778.88 --> 4779.16]  Fair,
[4779.28 --> 4780.20]  but you cared
[4780.20 --> 4781.48]  about making every one of them work.
[4781.50 --> 4782.78]  Once it was attainable,
[4782.96 --> 4784.66]  I wanted it so bad.
[4787.04 --> 4788.04]  Once it felt like
[4788.04 --> 4788.80]  it was in reach,
[4788.88 --> 4789.02]  dude,
[4789.18 --> 4790.10]  I would have been happy
[4790.10 --> 4791.08]  if I got half of them.
[4791.16 --> 4791.92]  I would have been thrilled
[4791.92 --> 4794.00]  if I had done half of them.
[4794.00 --> 4794.10]  Well,
[4794.10 --> 4794.60]  I think you still
[4794.60 --> 4795.36]  would have been profitable
[4795.36 --> 4795.96]  on half.
[4795.98 --> 4796.14]  Yeah,
[4796.30 --> 4797.02]  I think so.
[4797.14 --> 4797.30]  Yeah,
[4797.52 --> 4798.08]  pretty sure.
[4799.22 --> 4800.02]  And some of them
[4800.02 --> 4801.82]  weren't like crazy deals either.
[4802.74 --> 4803.84]  They were all pretty good,
[4803.94 --> 4804.58]  but some of them
[4804.58 --> 4805.64]  were clearly better deals
[4805.64 --> 4806.18]  than others,
[4806.32 --> 4807.02]  which is fine.
[4807.12 --> 4808.24]  If you were really
[4808.24 --> 4809.00]  trying to do this
[4809.00 --> 4810.10]  and make money off of it,
[4810.34 --> 4810.68]  you could,
[4811.10 --> 4811.82]  you know,
[4813.10 --> 4813.42]  spend,
[4813.90 --> 4815.00]  be a bit more picky
[4815.00 --> 4816.00]  about certain purchases.
[4816.00 --> 4816.42]  I think so.
[4816.42 --> 4818.54]  But it was,
[4818.60 --> 4819.60]  it was the right decision
[4819.60 --> 4820.28]  for the video
[4820.28 --> 4821.50]  to try to like
[4821.50 --> 4822.60]  push the line a little bit.
[4824.28 --> 4825.32]  Steve J3D says,
[4825.40 --> 4826.66]  I love the $50 motherboard video.
[4826.80 --> 4827.64]  Didn't like the,
[4827.80 --> 4829.04]  we try and break things for fun
[4829.04 --> 4830.16]  one you posted the other day.
[4830.48 --> 4831.72]  We did not try
[4831.72 --> 4832.58]  to break things for fun.
[4832.62 --> 4833.00]  In fact,
[4833.04 --> 4834.06]  as far as I know,
[4834.18 --> 4835.08]  nothing was broken.
[4835.40 --> 4836.20]  That motherboard
[4836.20 --> 4837.86]  had issues already.
[4838.32 --> 4839.12]  They didn't affect
[4839.12 --> 4839.98]  our ability to like
[4839.98 --> 4840.88]  play a game
[4840.88 --> 4841.34]  and run cinemas,
[4841.42 --> 4842.24]  the indulging thoughts one.
[4842.86 --> 4842.98]  Yeah.
[4843.46 --> 4844.86]  Not when you sprayed water
[4844.86 --> 4845.24]  all over it
[4845.24 --> 4845.76]  while it was running?
[4846.10 --> 4846.84]  That didn't break anything?
[4846.94 --> 4847.08]  No.
[4847.50 --> 4847.74]  Okay.
[4848.00 --> 4849.18]  And none of the parts
[4849.18 --> 4850.18]  that we were using
[4850.18 --> 4850.98]  for any of the,
[4851.20 --> 4852.50]  actually that one might have,
[4852.78 --> 4853.72]  but none of the parts
[4853.72 --> 4854.58]  that we were using
[4854.58 --> 4857.04]  were not sacrificial parts.
[4857.06 --> 4857.86]  It was clearly mentioned
[4857.86 --> 4858.58]  in the video
[4858.58 --> 4859.78]  that those were all parts
[4859.78 --> 4860.28]  that were like
[4860.28 --> 4861.12]  already having issues
[4861.12 --> 4861.88]  and were on their way out.
[4861.92 --> 4862.04]  Yeah.
[4862.44 --> 4862.60]  Yeah.
[4862.94 --> 4863.22]  So,
[4863.48 --> 4864.24]  so don't,
[4864.28 --> 4865.14]  yeah,
[4865.24 --> 4865.52]  don't,
[4865.60 --> 4866.48]  don't overthink it.
[4866.54 --> 4867.52]  We are not about
[4867.52 --> 4868.64]  destroying perfectly
[4868.64 --> 4869.92]  working stuff here.
[4870.48 --> 4871.14]  And so.
[4871.36 --> 4872.16]  There's been a lot
[4872.16 --> 4872.60]  of pitches
[4872.60 --> 4873.40]  over the years
[4873.40 --> 4874.12]  that would result
[4874.12 --> 4875.70]  in hardware dying
[4875.70 --> 4878.50]  that would have been videos
[4878.50 --> 4879.06]  that would have gotten
[4879.06 --> 4880.36]  millions of views
[4880.36 --> 4881.78]  that Linus has said no to.
[4882.02 --> 4883.60]  Just throwing that out there.
[4884.70 --> 4885.68]  Schraf 2K says,
[4885.80 --> 4886.68]  thanks for jacking up
[4886.68 --> 4887.54]  eBay mobile prices
[4887.54 --> 4888.62]  for the foreseeable future.
[4889.02 --> 4890.14]  This is a criticism
[4890.14 --> 4891.16]  that we get a lot.
[4892.30 --> 4892.56]  You know,
[4892.60 --> 4894.00]  every time we kind of.
[4894.16 --> 4895.10]  He might be kidding,
[4895.28 --> 4895.38]  but.
[4895.82 --> 4896.04]  Sorry?
[4896.28 --> 4897.28]  He might just be ribbing you,
[4897.38 --> 4897.48]  but.
[4897.60 --> 4897.72]  Yeah,
[4897.76 --> 4898.00]  maybe.
[4898.20 --> 4898.66]  But it's,
[4898.66 --> 4899.26]  it's a criticism
[4899.26 --> 4900.36]  we legitimately get
[4900.36 --> 4901.10]  a fair bit
[4901.10 --> 4902.08]  whenever we do a video
[4902.08 --> 4902.84]  about something
[4902.84 --> 4903.96]  that's kind of like a,
[4904.72 --> 4905.72]  like an open secret,
[4905.72 --> 4906.84]  but like a,
[4907.12 --> 4907.86]  or like a,
[4908.14 --> 4908.60]  you know,
[4908.64 --> 4909.60]  a niche community
[4909.60 --> 4911.92]  or a niche community.
[4912.04 --> 4912.60]  I think probably
[4912.60 --> 4913.64]  the best example
[4913.64 --> 4915.10]  of it was Windows 9.
[4915.46 --> 4916.38]  Oh yeah.
[4916.70 --> 4917.32]  When we,
[4917.46 --> 4918.52]  when we talked
[4918.52 --> 4919.42]  about that modified
[4919.42 --> 4921.66]  Windows 8 ISO
[4921.66 --> 4923.20]  that was super cool
[4923.20 --> 4924.40]  and all the bloat
[4924.40 --> 4925.20]  was stripped out
[4925.20 --> 4926.36]  at a time
[4926.36 --> 4927.22]  when Windows 10
[4927.22 --> 4928.12]  was still kind of
[4928.12 --> 4928.68]  a steaming pile
[4928.68 --> 4929.10]  of garbage
[4929.10 --> 4929.50]  and people
[4929.50 --> 4930.04]  didn't want
[4930.04 --> 4930.58]  to migrate
[4930.58 --> 4931.06]  to it.
[4931.60 --> 4932.76]  That project
[4932.76 --> 4933.90]  probably
[4933.90 --> 4935.52]  directly
[4935.52 --> 4936.62]  because of
[4936.62 --> 4938.02]  us highlighting it
[4938.02 --> 4940.72]  came under
[4940.72 --> 4941.68]  pretty intense
[4941.68 --> 4942.76]  scrutiny from Microsoft.
[4942.96 --> 4943.06]  Now,
[4943.12 --> 4944.04]  I believe since then
[4944.04 --> 4944.76]  they've kind of
[4944.76 --> 4945.62]  risen from the shadows
[4945.62 --> 4946.44]  with a different method
[4946.44 --> 4947.72]  where you download
[4947.72 --> 4948.70]  the ISO from Microsoft
[4948.70 --> 4949.44]  and then you download
[4949.44 --> 4950.56]  a modifier script
[4950.56 --> 4951.04]  from them
[4951.04 --> 4952.12]  instead of downloading
[4952.12 --> 4953.04]  the modified ISO
[4953.04 --> 4953.60]  because that was
[4953.60 --> 4954.30]  Microsoft's problem.
[4954.30 --> 4954.88]  you were downloading
[4954.88 --> 4957.22]  Windows from them
[4957.22 --> 4959.82]  which is bad.
[4960.14 --> 4960.54]  Kind of fair.
[4960.64 --> 4961.74]  But here's my,
[4961.78 --> 4962.70]  here's my counterpoint.
[4964.32 --> 4966.96]  I didn't post that
[4966.96 --> 4967.64]  on the internet.
[4970.04 --> 4971.84]  I didn't make
[4971.84 --> 4973.22]  Microsoft's terms
[4973.22 --> 4974.22]  of service
[4974.22 --> 4975.06]  and copyright
[4975.06 --> 4975.88]  and, you know,
[4976.26 --> 4977.06]  intellectual property
[4977.06 --> 4977.64]  protection.
[4979.00 --> 4981.00]  And what is my job
[4981.00 --> 4982.54]  if not to talk
[4982.54 --> 4983.22]  about what's going
[4983.22 --> 4983.86]  on in tech?
[4984.30 --> 4985.02]  And sometimes
[4985.02 --> 4986.14]  it's going to,
[4986.34 --> 4987.16]  sometimes it's going
[4987.16 --> 4987.58]  to make,
[4988.28 --> 4988.66]  you know,
[4988.72 --> 4989.72]  the prices go up
[4989.72 --> 4990.70]  on used hardware
[4990.70 --> 4991.28]  or sometimes
[4991.28 --> 4992.36]  it's going to
[4992.36 --> 4994.06]  draw unwanted
[4994.06 --> 4995.12]  attention
[4995.12 --> 4996.30]  to a,
[4996.30 --> 4997.86]  to a project.
[4998.34 --> 4999.16]  But like,
[5000.08 --> 5000.42]  isn't,
[5000.56 --> 5001.70]  isn't it my job
[5001.70 --> 5002.92]  to talk about
[5002.92 --> 5003.56]  what's going on
[5003.56 --> 5003.90]  in tech?
[5004.14 --> 5005.14]  Sometimes it's
[5005.14 --> 5005.72]  going to cause
[5005.72 --> 5013.22]  sometimes it's
[5013.22 --> 5013.62]  going to cause
[5013.62 --> 5014.56]  problems for me.
[5014.62 --> 5014.96]  Careful,
[5015.04 --> 5015.52]  we have to burn
[5015.52 --> 5015.66]  that.
[5015.72 --> 5016.12]  You can't break
[5016.12 --> 5016.38]  it yet.
[5016.86 --> 5017.46]  But like,
[5017.50 --> 5018.48]  that's my job,
[5018.48 --> 5019.12]  right?
[5019.22 --> 5019.70]  Isn't it?
[5020.16 --> 5020.40]  Yeah.
[5020.60 --> 5020.80]  No,
[5020.86 --> 5021.22]  I mean,
[5021.24 --> 5021.82]  I defend it.
[5023.78 --> 5024.60]  I defend it.
[5024.68 --> 5025.32]  And to be clear,
[5025.40 --> 5026.10]  Scharf was just
[5026.10 --> 5026.50]  removing you.
[5026.70 --> 5027.46]  Or Schraf,
[5027.60 --> 5027.80]  sorry.
[5027.80 --> 5029.66]  And I think we're
[5029.66 --> 5030.16]  going to have a
[5030.16 --> 5030.76]  video coming.
[5030.96 --> 5031.46]  And that's
[5031.46 --> 5032.26]  actually the main
[5032.26 --> 5033.20]  reason why I'm
[5033.20 --> 5033.84]  addressing this.
[5034.36 --> 5035.14]  We're going to
[5035.14 --> 5035.92]  have a video
[5035.92 --> 5037.12]  coming that
[5037.12 --> 5037.58]  there's going to
[5037.58 --> 5038.72]  be a lot of
[5038.72 --> 5040.20]  people coming
[5040.20 --> 5040.84]  after me for,
[5041.04 --> 5041.90]  for that.
[5042.48 --> 5043.34]  We will be
[5043.34 --> 5044.06]  shedding a light
[5044.06 --> 5044.86]  on something
[5044.86 --> 5046.78]  that is super
[5046.78 --> 5048.00]  cool for techie
[5048.00 --> 5049.14]  people to know.
[5049.14 --> 5052.42]  but it's like a
[5052.42 --> 5053.08]  secret that
[5053.08 --> 5053.68]  techie people
[5053.68 --> 5053.96]  know.
[5054.22 --> 5055.06]  And I think
[5055.06 --> 5055.86]  you and I
[5055.86 --> 5056.80]  are kind of
[5056.80 --> 5057.60]  aligned on that
[5057.60 --> 5058.22]  we don't have
[5058.22 --> 5058.58]  secrets.
[5058.76 --> 5059.24]  We have
[5059.24 --> 5060.80]  information for
[5060.80 --> 5061.40]  the people and
[5061.40 --> 5062.06]  that's our job.
[5062.94 --> 5064.52]  And I don't even
[5064.52 --> 5065.06]  know what this is,
[5065.14 --> 5065.42]  but yeah,
[5065.48 --> 5066.06]  I agree with that.
[5066.14 --> 5066.52]  Make sure you
[5066.52 --> 5067.04]  watch the video
[5067.04 --> 5067.52]  when it comes
[5067.52 --> 5067.80]  out.
[5067.88 --> 5068.14]  Yeah.
[5069.08 --> 5069.74]  Because I don't
[5069.74 --> 5070.66]  know if it's
[5070.66 --> 5071.24]  going to last.
[5071.26 --> 5071.70]  Do I know what
[5071.70 --> 5072.08]  this is?
[5072.16 --> 5072.50]  We'll see.
[5073.32 --> 5073.68]  No,
[5073.72 --> 5074.18]  I don't think so.
[5074.28 --> 5074.36]  Okay.
[5074.48 --> 5074.68]  Okay.
[5074.68 --> 5075.28]  Yeah,
[5075.36 --> 5075.86]  I don't think so.
[5075.90 --> 5076.16]  I don't know.
[5076.22 --> 5076.48]  We've been,
[5076.72 --> 5077.44]  I've been feeling
[5077.44 --> 5077.92]  kind of,
[5077.92 --> 5078.86]  I've been feeling
[5078.86 --> 5079.78]  kind of irreverent
[5079.78 --> 5080.14]  lately.
[5081.32 --> 5082.10]  Not going to
[5082.10 --> 5082.38]  lie.
[5082.94 --> 5083.28]  One sec.
[5085.26 --> 5086.08]  I spelled it
[5086.08 --> 5086.24]  wrong.
[5092.22 --> 5092.88]  I've been
[5092.88 --> 5093.24]  feeling,
[5093.68 --> 5094.50]  I've been
[5094.50 --> 5095.22]  feeling a little,
[5096.54 --> 5097.44]  you know,
[5098.66 --> 5099.12]  fuck it
[5099.12 --> 5099.96]  lately.
[5102.28 --> 5103.58]  I liked the
[5103.58 --> 5104.16]  video,
[5104.68 --> 5105.32]  that recently
[5105.32 --> 5105.72]  got taken
[5105.72 --> 5106.24]  down because
[5106.24 --> 5107.16]  I'll refer to
[5107.16 --> 5107.72]  it that way
[5107.72 --> 5108.72]  to add a little
[5108.72 --> 5109.28]  bit of buffer
[5109.28 --> 5109.80]  because there's
[5109.80 --> 5110.38]  technically two
[5110.38 --> 5110.90]  videos that
[5110.90 --> 5111.42]  recently got
[5111.42 --> 5111.80]  taken down.
[5111.86 --> 5112.30]  So who knows?
[5112.78 --> 5113.26]  Yeah.
[5113.50 --> 5115.22]  Because that's
[5115.22 --> 5115.44]  been,
[5115.50 --> 5116.32]  that's been a
[5116.32 --> 5118.46]  laughed about
[5118.46 --> 5119.68]  non-secret for
[5119.68 --> 5120.74]  so long.
[5121.02 --> 5121.46]  Yeah.
[5121.82 --> 5123.58]  But there's
[5123.58 --> 5124.24]  always new people
[5124.24 --> 5125.06]  entering the
[5125.06 --> 5125.44]  space.
[5125.68 --> 5125.88]  Yeah.
[5125.92 --> 5126.72]  So it's also a
[5126.72 --> 5128.00]  question that I've
[5128.00 --> 5129.56]  received forever.
[5129.94 --> 5131.04]  Like since I was a
[5131.04 --> 5131.88]  kid, people are
[5131.88 --> 5132.44]  like, is this thing
[5132.44 --> 5132.80]  legit?
[5133.20 --> 5133.42]  Yeah.
[5133.42 --> 5135.76]  No, no one
[5135.76 --> 5136.06]  cares.
[5136.60 --> 5137.38]  So it's like,
[5137.64 --> 5138.68]  yeah, I don't
[5138.68 --> 5138.82]  know.
[5139.06 --> 5139.70]  I'm down with it.
[5139.78 --> 5140.38]  I was down with
[5140.38 --> 5140.68]  it when it
[5140.68 --> 5140.96]  happened.
[5141.36 --> 5142.14]  I think how
[5142.14 --> 5142.62]  everything went
[5142.62 --> 5143.04]  was fine.
[5143.60 --> 5143.96]  Personally.
[5144.32 --> 5145.14]  Luca asks, are
[5145.14 --> 5145.74]  you trying to get
[5145.74 --> 5146.62]  canceled, Linus?
[5147.28 --> 5147.68]  Dude.
[5147.68 --> 5153.68]  if I was trying to
[5153.68 --> 5154.62]  get canceled, you'd
[5154.62 --> 5154.88]  know.
[5157.88 --> 5158.76]  I don't know, man.
[5158.84 --> 5159.60]  We talked about
[5159.60 --> 5160.50]  this a few weeks
[5160.50 --> 5161.20]  ago, so I'm not
[5161.20 --> 5162.02]  going to like get
[5162.02 --> 5162.80]  into it again or
[5162.80 --> 5163.72]  anything, but I
[5163.72 --> 5164.86]  think I'd be, I
[5164.86 --> 5165.46]  think I'd be a
[5165.46 --> 5165.84]  little more
[5165.84 --> 5167.60]  difficult to, to
[5167.60 --> 5168.92]  you can't kill
[5168.92 --> 5169.56]  the undead.
[5170.12 --> 5170.52]  Yeah.
[5171.52 --> 5172.20]  I was going to
[5172.20 --> 5172.62]  say, we already
[5172.62 --> 5173.38]  came back from the
[5173.38 --> 5173.68]  sticks.
[5173.68 --> 5178.58]  Oh, man.
[5179.26 --> 5180.40]  Like it is, it
[5180.40 --> 5181.64]  is no, it is no
[5181.64 --> 5184.04]  secret that, you
[5184.04 --> 5185.02]  know, we have.
[5185.12 --> 5185.70]  You're kind of a
[5185.70 --> 5185.96]  bard.
[5186.54 --> 5187.30]  You're close to a
[5187.30 --> 5187.54]  bard.
[5188.16 --> 5188.88]  I thought they
[5188.88 --> 5189.94]  died when you gave
[5189.94 --> 5191.24]  them healing damage.
[5192.30 --> 5193.70]  Like works backwards
[5193.70 --> 5194.52]  for undead.
[5195.10 --> 5196.10]  Like it is, it is
[5196.10 --> 5197.84]  no, it is no
[5197.84 --> 5199.60]  secret that after
[5199.60 --> 5200.66]  July of last
[5200.66 --> 5202.00]  year, we
[5202.00 --> 5202.92]  experienced a
[5202.92 --> 5204.34]  precipitous drop
[5204.34 --> 5205.94]  in viewership and
[5205.94 --> 5207.48]  therefore our
[5207.48 --> 5210.94]  bidness that we
[5210.94 --> 5211.06]  have.
[5211.06 --> 5211.70]  These graphs are
[5211.70 --> 5212.46]  super informative
[5212.46 --> 5213.18]  of like how
[5213.18 --> 5214.66]  channels work, what
[5214.66 --> 5216.02]  things impact their
[5216.02 --> 5217.28]  success and their
[5217.28 --> 5218.58]  non-success and
[5218.58 --> 5220.56]  yeah, they're, I
[5220.56 --> 5221.52]  think people would
[5221.52 --> 5222.74]  have a surprisingly
[5222.74 --> 5224.72]  fun time actually
[5224.72 --> 5225.74]  just poking around
[5225.74 --> 5226.52]  social blade and
[5226.52 --> 5227.50]  like seeing how
[5227.50 --> 5228.68]  different channels do
[5228.68 --> 5228.98]  things.
[5228.98 --> 5229.38]  Yeah.
[5229.52 --> 5230.50]  It's, it's genuinely
[5230.50 --> 5231.82]  surprisingly enlightening.
[5232.14 --> 5233.36]  So this is 28.
[5233.62 --> 5234.44]  Oh, this is, this is,
[5234.58 --> 5235.44]  this is 30 days.
[5235.60 --> 5237.90]  So we are, we are
[5237.90 --> 5240.54]  not there, but boy
[5240.54 --> 5241.26]  are we ever.
[5241.42 --> 5242.22]  But that's a line
[5242.22 --> 5242.94]  that's going up.
[5243.16 --> 5244.18]  Boy are we ever, we
[5244.18 --> 5245.22]  are tracking back.
[5245.40 --> 5245.56]  Yeah.
[5245.70 --> 5246.94]  And you can feel it,
[5246.98 --> 5247.22]  man.
[5247.36 --> 5248.30]  The videos feel good.
[5248.66 --> 5248.84]  Yeah.
[5248.86 --> 5249.20]  I know I've been
[5249.20 --> 5249.96]  saying that a lot on
[5249.96 --> 5250.78]  Wayne lately, but like
[5250.78 --> 5251.70]  they actually just do.
[5252.00 --> 5252.66]  No, the vibe, the
[5252.66 --> 5253.38]  vibes feel good.
[5253.50 --> 5255.74]  I think it's, I think
[5255.74 --> 5257.24]  it's, I think it's, I
[5257.24 --> 5257.90]  think it's good.
[5257.90 --> 5258.98]  I think things are
[5258.98 --> 5259.18]  good.
[5259.28 --> 5260.20]  Oh, whoa, dude.
[5260.68 --> 5261.08]  What up?
[5262.56 --> 5263.26]  What is this?
[5264.08 --> 5264.94]  Streams with Sarah
[5264.94 --> 5265.48]  announcement.
[5265.72 --> 5266.56]  Floatplane exclusive
[5266.56 --> 5267.12]  merch.
[5267.36 --> 5267.52]  Yeah.
[5267.56 --> 5267.98]  You didn't know
[5267.98 --> 5268.26]  about this?
[5268.36 --> 5269.02]  I did not know
[5269.02 --> 5269.40]  about this.
[5271.24 --> 5271.84]  It's cool.
[5272.00 --> 5273.02]  What am I, what am I
[5273.02 --> 5273.38]  looking at?
[5273.42 --> 5274.04]  This is 48.
[5274.20 --> 5275.10]  What the, what the
[5275.10 --> 5275.92]  heck is going on?
[5275.92 --> 5277.52]  What is this video?
[5277.82 --> 5278.62]  I have not watched
[5278.62 --> 5279.02]  this.
[5279.02 --> 5282.88]  Where did we come
[5282.88 --> 5283.16]  from?
[5283.64 --> 5284.72]  I don't know, but that
[5284.72 --> 5285.84]  was the timestamp we
[5285.84 --> 5286.24]  were at.
[5286.38 --> 5290.54]  Why did, um, what am I
[5290.54 --> 5291.46]  even, what do, what do
[5291.46 --> 5292.48]  they have me saying?
[5292.64 --> 5293.26]  I don't know.
[5294.20 --> 5295.02]  Uh, okay.
[5295.12 --> 5295.86]  Well, you know what?
[5295.98 --> 5296.12]  Sure.
[5296.32 --> 5297.70]  I think the idea is
[5297.70 --> 5298.70]  basically that she's
[5298.70 --> 5299.60]  going to be streaming
[5299.60 --> 5301.38]  on Floatplane and she's
[5301.38 --> 5302.60]  going to take community
[5302.60 --> 5304.46]  input on a design.
[5304.46 --> 5307.74]  Um, and then I think I
[5307.74 --> 5308.46]  could be wrong about
[5308.46 --> 5308.80]  this.
[5309.48 --> 5310.32]  It's going to say in
[5310.32 --> 5311.34]  the post, so you should
[5311.34 --> 5312.00]  really just read the
[5312.00 --> 5313.94]  post, but I think that's
[5313.94 --> 5314.86]  going to be a Floatplane
[5314.86 --> 5316.32]  exclusive shirt, but it
[5316.32 --> 5317.00]  doesn't mean that the
[5317.00 --> 5317.88]  design is going to have
[5317.88 --> 5318.70]  like the Floatplane logo
[5318.70 --> 5320.16]  on it necessarily, unless
[5320.16 --> 5320.98]  the community asks for
[5320.98 --> 5321.24]  that.
[5321.56 --> 5323.00]  Um, and she riffs on it
[5323.00 --> 5323.70]  in a certain way.
[5324.36 --> 5326.06]  Um, maybe I should just
[5326.06 --> 5326.82]  read the post.
[5328.82 --> 5329.60]  It's on the first
[5329.60 --> 5330.20]  Floatplane exclusive
[5330.20 --> 5330.80]  merch live.
[5330.88 --> 5331.50]  You can also contribute
[5331.50 --> 5332.36]  to the design in chat.
[5332.48 --> 5332.62]  Yep.
[5332.62 --> 5335.06]  This is the clip Linus
[5335.06 --> 5336.14]  and Luke will react to
[5336.14 --> 5337.98]  today on WAN, but
[5337.98 --> 5338.88]  there's an early access
[5338.88 --> 5340.46]  to our fellow floaties.
[5340.56 --> 5341.12]  Are we doing that
[5341.12 --> 5341.38]  today?
[5342.10 --> 5342.98]  I don't, I think we
[5342.98 --> 5343.72]  want to jump the gun.
[5344.18 --> 5345.10]  I think, oh, I think
[5345.10 --> 5346.62]  this is the early access.
[5347.96 --> 5348.36]  Maybe.
[5348.64 --> 5349.78]  Well, okay then.
[5351.06 --> 5352.02]  Great job.
[5353.06 --> 5353.46]  Professionals.
[5353.46 --> 5354.36]  Uh, yes, we were
[5354.36 --> 5355.06]  supposed to react to
[5355.06 --> 5355.84]  that on WAN, so maybe
[5355.84 --> 5356.92]  we should get audio
[5356.92 --> 5357.80]  and get that going.
[5358.00 --> 5358.42]  Uh, okay.
[5361.00 --> 5362.40]  Hey, conveniently, we
[5362.40 --> 5363.66]  already made sure that
[5363.66 --> 5365.12]  audio works if we're
[5365.12 --> 5366.96]  watching videos, uh, on
[5366.96 --> 5368.48]  the computer machine.
[5368.66 --> 5369.70]  Uh, okay, cool.
[5369.80 --> 5370.72]  Told you I fixed it.
[5371.10 --> 5372.10]  We did from Dan's.
[5372.24 --> 5372.56]  Sure.
[5373.22 --> 5373.78]  And make sure.
[5374.70 --> 5375.12]  Okay.
[5375.40 --> 5375.82]  Um.
[5378.84 --> 5379.72]  Hey, Sarah.
[5380.62 --> 5381.92]  Let's do Floatplane
[5381.92 --> 5383.00]  exclusive merch.
[5383.38 --> 5384.78]  I'm Linus, and I love
[5384.78 --> 5385.66]  badminton.
[5386.22 --> 5387.44]  I'm also the average
[5387.44 --> 5388.42]  height for a Canadian
[5388.42 --> 5389.58]  male my age.
[5389.58 --> 5390.90]  That's a weird thing
[5390.90 --> 5392.60]  to say, but sure.
[5393.24 --> 5394.08]  And make sure to
[5394.08 --> 5395.30]  stream it on Floatplane.
[5395.50 --> 5396.90]  It'll be lots of fun.
[5397.12 --> 5398.20]  Uh, okay.
[5398.50 --> 5399.36]  Um, I'll stream it
[5399.36 --> 5399.98]  next Thursday.
[5400.36 --> 5401.84]  I love eating chicken.
[5402.28 --> 5402.80]  Starfleet.
[5403.80 --> 5404.72]  Starfleet.
[5404.72 --> 5404.84]  Starfleet.
[5405.52 --> 5406.74]  Maybe you guys can help.
[5407.02 --> 5408.36]  Drop by at 10 a.m.
[5408.76 --> 5409.30]  And we will.
[5409.30 --> 5409.36]  No.
[5410.10 --> 5411.24]  Where we'll be making
[5411.24 --> 5412.84]  our first ever Floatplane
[5412.84 --> 5413.72]  exclusive merch.
[5414.08 --> 5414.74]  See you there.
[5414.74 --> 5421.82]  Linus, you paid people
[5421.82 --> 5422.52]  to make that.
[5424.42 --> 5425.48]  I didn't.
[5426.54 --> 5427.30]  Linus Media Group
[5427.30 --> 5428.34]  Incorporated did.
[5428.98 --> 5429.88]  Who owns most of that?
[5429.90 --> 5430.78]  I would never have done
[5430.78 --> 5431.00]  that.
[5431.22 --> 5432.14]  Who owns most of that?
[5432.58 --> 5432.92]  Me.
[5433.26 --> 5433.96]  I'm all crazy.
[5435.98 --> 5436.90]  Oh, that was great.
[5437.76 --> 5438.28]  Starfield.
[5438.60 --> 5440.08]  I love eating chicken.
[5440.52 --> 5441.04]  Starfield.
[5441.62 --> 5442.58]  My goodness.
[5442.74 --> 5443.48]  I think you like eating
[5443.48 --> 5444.90]  hot sauce with chicken.
[5445.26 --> 5445.50]  Yeah.
[5446.04 --> 5446.82]  Yeah, it's an important
[5446.82 --> 5448.42]  part of the equation.
[5449.08 --> 5449.60]  Yeah, I'm going to be
[5449.60 --> 5450.06]  setting that up.
[5450.12 --> 5451.50]  That's going to be so fun.
[5451.72 --> 5452.52]  I think it's going to be
[5452.52 --> 5452.56]  really fun.
[5452.56 --> 5453.46]  We've done a few of those.
[5453.58 --> 5454.42]  Sarah has done some
[5454.42 --> 5455.10]  in the before.
[5455.32 --> 5457.30]  I think the Gone Fishing
[5457.30 --> 5458.60]  original one was done
[5458.60 --> 5459.74]  on Floatplane Stream.
[5459.84 --> 5460.98]  I think the Privateer shirt
[5460.98 --> 5461.82]  was designed on
[5461.82 --> 5462.94]  Floatplane Stream as well.
[5463.28 --> 5464.04]  Every Halloween we do
[5464.04 --> 5465.48]  pumpkin carving ones too.
[5465.48 --> 5465.50]  But it wasn't exclusive.
[5465.74 --> 5465.92]  No.
[5466.14 --> 5467.78]  So this is using our
[5467.78 --> 5469.52]  connector to the LTT store.
[5469.66 --> 5470.22]  So you'll have to
[5470.22 --> 5471.56]  Does that finally work?
[5471.90 --> 5472.68]  Oh, is it like
[5472.68 --> 5473.66]  exclusive exclusive?
[5474.58 --> 5475.20]  No, I mean,
[5475.22 --> 5475.90]  does it work on
[5475.90 --> 5477.12]  like the store side though?
[5477.44 --> 5478.42]  I know Floatplane
[5478.42 --> 5479.34]  has supported the feature
[5479.34 --> 5480.00]  for a long time,
[5480.06 --> 5481.00]  but like do we finally
[5481.00 --> 5481.68]  have integration
[5481.68 --> 5482.38]  between the store
[5482.38 --> 5482.78]  and Floatplane?
[5482.94 --> 5483.72]  We've had that since
[5483.72 --> 5484.58]  LTX 2023.
[5486.12 --> 5487.34]  Like to do what though?
[5487.82 --> 5489.38]  To make it so that,
[5489.46 --> 5490.46]  okay, so it goes,
[5490.62 --> 5491.48]  it's one directional.
[5492.10 --> 5492.26]  Yeah.
[5492.34 --> 5493.42]  So you can log into
[5493.42 --> 5493.76]  the store.
[5493.76 --> 5494.52]  It's got that one thing.
[5494.52 --> 5495.86]  Using your Floatplane account.
[5496.14 --> 5496.66]  And then there
[5496.66 --> 5497.84]  It doesn't know it's beautiful.
[5498.26 --> 5499.10]  Exclusive things
[5499.10 --> 5500.36]  given to you because you have
[5500.36 --> 5501.48]  It's the best feature ever.
[5502.12 --> 5502.74]  Because you've been
[5502.74 --> 5503.48]  authenticated as a
[5503.48 --> 5503.88]  Floatplane user.
[5504.06 --> 5505.36]  What we still don't have
[5505.36 --> 5507.70]  is like if you buy
[5507.70 --> 5508.86]  something on LTT store,
[5509.00 --> 5509.60]  you are granted
[5509.60 --> 5510.46]  something on Floatplane.
[5510.52 --> 5511.54]  It doesn't go the other way.
[5511.78 --> 5512.70]  It just goes
[5512.70 --> 5514.10]  Floatplane to LTT store,
[5514.18 --> 5515.28]  not LTT store to Floatplane.
[5515.50 --> 5516.34]  We do want to do that
[5516.34 --> 5516.76]  eventually,
[5516.90 --> 5517.94]  but it's far,
[5518.34 --> 5518.66]  far,
[5519.04 --> 5519.88]  far, far, far roadmap.
[5520.10 --> 5520.28]  There's
[5520.28 --> 5522.92]  many things we need to do
[5522.92 --> 5523.98]  that are high priority
[5523.98 --> 5525.78]  from both the users,
[5525.94 --> 5526.38]  the creators,
[5526.38 --> 5527.92]  and the people running
[5527.92 --> 5528.44]  the service
[5528.44 --> 5529.60]  that want done
[5529.60 --> 5530.48]  before we would be able
[5530.48 --> 5531.06]  to get to that.
[5531.42 --> 5531.82]  Got it.
[5532.00 --> 5532.22]  Yeah.
[5533.04 --> 5533.28]  Neat.
[5533.28 --> 5533.86]  Just making it clear
[5533.86 --> 5534.50]  before people are like,
[5534.54 --> 5535.02]  where is it?
[5535.06 --> 5535.52]  I want it.
[5535.60 --> 5536.06]  It's like, no,
[5536.16 --> 5536.90]  it's probably not coming
[5536.90 --> 5537.72]  for a very long time.
[5537.72 --> 5539.06]  2% cash back rewards
[5539.06 --> 5539.70]  on LTT store
[5539.70 --> 5540.60]  from Floatplane subs
[5540.60 --> 5541.10]  when, yeah,
[5541.46 --> 5542.62]  no time soon.
[5543.50 --> 5543.86]  Ever.
[5544.40 --> 5545.26]  Let's say that.
[5545.32 --> 5545.62]  All right.
[5545.68 --> 5546.70]  That will never happen.
[5546.92 --> 5547.22]  Cool.
[5547.94 --> 5549.18]  Floatplane is too cheap
[5549.18 --> 5550.76]  that we would just
[5550.76 --> 5551.54]  lose money.
[5551.54 --> 5554.58]  Oh, I subscribed
[5554.58 --> 5555.10]  to Floatplane
[5555.10 --> 5555.74]  for one month
[5555.74 --> 5556.18]  and then bought
[5556.18 --> 5556.86]  all the different
[5556.86 --> 5557.40]  screwdrivers
[5557.40 --> 5557.96]  and a backpack
[5557.96 --> 5559.06]  and then unsubscribed.
[5559.20 --> 5559.56]  Wow.
[5559.82 --> 5560.72]  I just made
[5560.72 --> 5561.72]  so much money.
[5562.48 --> 5563.90]  It's only 2%.
[5563.90 --> 5564.52]  If they buy
[5564.52 --> 5565.16]  a bunch of stuff,
[5565.20 --> 5566.18]  I think we still win.
[5566.70 --> 5566.92]  Well,
[5567.56 --> 5568.00]  if they have a
[5568.00 --> 5569.54]  grandfathered OG sub,
[5569.66 --> 5570.34]  it's $3.
[5570.92 --> 5571.58]  That's true.
[5571.94 --> 5572.42]  And there's
[5572.42 --> 5573.64]  payment transaction fees
[5573.64 --> 5574.70]  and stuff that we lose.
[5575.62 --> 5575.82]  Yeah,
[5575.92 --> 5577.50]  the OG subs
[5577.50 --> 5578.28]  are like really
[5578.28 --> 5580.26]  not profitable.
[5580.26 --> 5582.06]  They technically are.
[5582.20 --> 5582.60]  Are they?
[5582.78 --> 5582.98]  Yeah.
[5583.78 --> 5584.70]  Because certain costs
[5584.70 --> 5585.60]  of things have gone down.
[5585.84 --> 5586.32]  Oh, I see.
[5586.62 --> 5586.80]  Yeah.
[5586.96 --> 5587.30]  Okay.
[5587.34 --> 5588.24]  I think the last time
[5588.24 --> 5588.92]  we talked about it,
[5588.94 --> 5590.12]  it was breakeven at best.
[5590.18 --> 5590.74]  It was basically
[5590.74 --> 5591.40]  not so much.
[5591.58 --> 5591.80]  Well,
[5592.04 --> 5592.86]  it also depends,
[5592.98 --> 5593.06]  like,
[5593.12 --> 5594.64]  do you account
[5594.64 --> 5595.58]  for like dev time?
[5596.24 --> 5596.92]  I mean,
[5597.26 --> 5597.84]  yeah.
[5598.02 --> 5599.14]  Then probably not.
[5599.24 --> 5599.58]  Okay.
[5599.82 --> 5601.00]  But the rest of them are,
[5601.08 --> 5601.88]  so we're good.
[5602.20 --> 5602.96]  Let's go.
[5606.16 --> 5606.82]  It's fine.
[5607.24 --> 5607.88]  Everything's fine.
[5608.82 --> 5609.58]  What about us
[5609.58 --> 5610.66]  $10 ballers,
[5610.76 --> 5610.96]  Luke?
[5611.38 --> 5611.78]  Yeah,
[5611.84 --> 5612.54]  you guys are great.
[5612.70 --> 5613.06]  Thank you.
[5613.14 --> 5613.30]  Well,
[5613.32 --> 5613.88]  thank you very much.
[5614.00 --> 5614.16]  Yeah.
[5614.22 --> 5614.86]  Mind you,
[5614.96 --> 5615.64]  with how much
[5615.64 --> 5616.86]  you watch the streams,
[5617.08 --> 5617.88]  I'm not sure
[5617.88 --> 5619.26]  if you individually are.
[5622.10 --> 5623.00]  Streaming basically
[5623.00 --> 5624.10]  just completely
[5624.10 --> 5625.64]  destroys the business model.
[5626.50 --> 5627.14]  Not that you
[5627.14 --> 5627.84]  shouldn't watch the stream.
[5627.84 --> 5628.00]  Yeah,
[5628.06 --> 5629.14]  you should watch the streams.
[5629.20 --> 5629.68]  You should watch
[5629.68 --> 5630.24]  on float plane.
[5630.84 --> 5631.50]  But yeah,
[5631.58 --> 5633.32]  streaming is super expensive.
[5633.32 --> 5634.50]  The sickest combo
[5634.50 --> 5635.76]  is the,
[5636.20 --> 5637.50]  watches the entire
[5637.50 --> 5638.44]  WAN show stream
[5638.44 --> 5639.08]  every time
[5639.08 --> 5639.88]  and every other stream
[5639.88 --> 5640.96]  that happens on the platform
[5640.96 --> 5641.70]  OG sub.
[5642.76 --> 5643.30]  Oh yeah.
[5643.34 --> 5644.28]  That one's the like.
[5644.34 --> 5645.24]  That's the money loser
[5645.24 --> 5645.50]  right there.
[5645.50 --> 5646.42]  That's a gamer move.
[5646.84 --> 5647.04]  Yeah.
[5647.18 --> 5647.36]  Yeah.
[5647.44 --> 5648.42]  Not that you shouldn't do it.
[5648.50 --> 5648.84]  Go ahead.
[5648.96 --> 5649.82]  We are doing fine
[5649.82 --> 5650.72]  to be super clear.
[5650.82 --> 5651.10]  Yes.
[5651.28 --> 5651.76]  Streaming is.
[5651.90 --> 5652.92]  Don't not use the platform.
[5652.92 --> 5654.62]  Streaming is very expensive
[5654.62 --> 5655.32]  compared to VOD.
[5655.40 --> 5656.18]  It can't be buffered
[5656.18 --> 5656.72]  essentially
[5656.72 --> 5658.04]  if you want decent latency,
[5658.22 --> 5659.04]  which I think we have
[5659.04 --> 5659.80]  on float plane.
[5660.38 --> 5660.72]  Yeah.
[5660.72 --> 5662.66]  That's a big part
[5662.66 --> 5663.20]  of the problem.
[5664.08 --> 5665.10]  And the beta site
[5665.10 --> 5666.20]  now has manual controls.
[5666.82 --> 5667.68]  Manual controls?
[5667.84 --> 5667.98]  Yeah.
[5668.00 --> 5668.62]  I've been telling people
[5668.62 --> 5668.98]  in the,
[5668.98 --> 5669.72]  in the float plane chat
[5669.72 --> 5670.14]  all day.
[5670.82 --> 5671.38]  What do you mean
[5671.38 --> 5672.52]  by manual controls?
[5672.72 --> 5673.84]  We had a player limitation
[5673.84 --> 5674.66]  for a long time
[5674.66 --> 5675.98]  where for live streaming
[5675.98 --> 5677.90]  it was just auto quality.
[5678.56 --> 5678.96]  Oh.
[5679.38 --> 5680.78]  And people didn't like that
[5680.78 --> 5681.50]  because sometimes
[5681.50 --> 5682.46]  it would jump too much.
[5682.68 --> 5684.02]  It would switch too often.
[5684.60 --> 5685.92]  So on the beta site
[5685.92 --> 5686.94]  we added manual controls.
[5687.10 --> 5687.70]  Oh right.
[5687.76 --> 5688.44]  I'm not on the beta.
[5688.76 --> 5689.92]  You're doing real time
[5689.92 --> 5690.86]  conversion?
[5691.14 --> 5691.78]  I thought you weren't.
[5692.84 --> 5693.24]  What?
[5693.88 --> 5695.14]  You said switching qualities.
[5695.32 --> 5696.18]  Oh, for live streams?
[5696.48 --> 5696.68]  Yeah.
[5697.32 --> 5698.04]  You do multi...
[5698.04 --> 5699.32]  Not what we're pushing up.
[5699.54 --> 5700.78]  What people are taking down.
[5701.40 --> 5702.02]  Oh, okay.
[5704.24 --> 5704.64]  Okay.
[5705.74 --> 5706.60]  Oh, look at that.
[5706.80 --> 5707.02]  Oh.
[5707.34 --> 5707.52]  Yeah.
[5708.12 --> 5708.46]  There you go.
[5709.16 --> 5709.84]  So that's a thing now.
[5709.98 --> 5710.60]  My understanding
[5710.60 --> 5711.30]  was that you had to
[5711.30 --> 5712.26]  real time transcode
[5712.26 --> 5713.56]  all of those at the same time.
[5713.84 --> 5714.50]  Does that still happen?
[5714.90 --> 5715.08]  Yeah.
[5715.50 --> 5715.84]  Oh, okay.
[5716.32 --> 5717.76]  I thought you weren't doing that.
[5717.90 --> 5718.22]  That's what I meant.
[5718.22 --> 5718.78]  We're not doing that.
[5718.78 --> 5720.06]  Someone is.
[5720.16 --> 5720.76]  Don't worry about it.
[5720.84 --> 5720.98]  Yeah.
[5722.82 --> 5723.22]  Basically.
[5723.72 --> 5724.42]  It's not really...
[5724.42 --> 5724.74]  It's just...
[5724.74 --> 5725.34]  It's not going to be
[5725.34 --> 5726.34]  very interesting for...
[5726.34 --> 5727.28]  Speaking of sites
[5727.28 --> 5729.24]  that use someone else's
[5729.24 --> 5731.16]  underlying technology...
[5731.16 --> 5731.92]  Oh, Noherty!
[5732.36 --> 5733.54]  It's Jack Doherty!
[5735.32 --> 5736.58]  We're talking about this?
[5737.04 --> 5738.34]  Internet personality
[5738.34 --> 5739.46]  Jack Doherty...
[5739.46 --> 5740.12]  This is in the doc?
[5740.38 --> 5740.62]  Yeah.
[5740.84 --> 5741.54]  A 21-year-old
[5741.54 --> 5742.32]  who's primarily known
[5742.32 --> 5743.96]  for controversial prank videos
[5743.96 --> 5745.36]  crashed his McLaren
[5745.36 --> 5746.22]  during a live stream
[5746.22 --> 5747.08]  this past weekend.
[5747.08 --> 5748.52]  Footage of the incident
[5748.52 --> 5749.70]  appears to show him
[5749.70 --> 5751.08]  speeding in rainy conditions
[5751.08 --> 5752.28]  while glancing back and forth
[5752.28 --> 5753.28]  at a phone in his hand
[5753.28 --> 5754.18]  before he loses control
[5754.18 --> 5754.66]  of the vehicle,
[5755.12 --> 5756.38]  crosses multiple lanes of traffic
[5756.38 --> 5757.44]  and hits a guardrail.
[5758.70 --> 5760.22]  Doherty continued filming
[5760.22 --> 5761.90]  the aftermath of the accident.
[5762.56 --> 5763.10]  His cameraman,
[5763.40 --> 5763.90]  Michael David,
[5764.06 --> 5765.56]  who was sitting in the passenger seat,
[5765.82 --> 5766.52]  had his head injured
[5766.52 --> 5767.04]  in the accident
[5767.04 --> 5768.24]  and later received stitches.
[5768.82 --> 5769.56]  At one point
[5769.56 --> 5770.06]  in the footage
[5770.06 --> 5770.86]  from the crash site,
[5771.06 --> 5772.54]  Doherty hands the device
[5772.54 --> 5773.02]  to David,
[5773.26 --> 5774.90]  who is bleeding from a head wound,
[5774.90 --> 5775.98]  and instructs him
[5775.98 --> 5776.86]  to continue filming.
[5777.50 --> 5778.48]  When another young man
[5778.48 --> 5779.54]  suggests that someone else
[5779.54 --> 5780.28]  should take over filming
[5780.28 --> 5780.76]  from David,
[5780.88 --> 5781.70]  seeing as his face
[5781.70 --> 5782.46]  appeared to be injured,
[5783.06 --> 5783.84]  Doherty prevents anyone
[5783.84 --> 5784.52]  from taking over,
[5784.68 --> 5786.14]  instead giving the concerned man
[5786.14 --> 5787.48]  another device to film with
[5787.48 --> 5788.32]  and telling him
[5788.32 --> 5789.38]  to make it look good.
[5790.48 --> 5791.24]  Some images
[5791.24 --> 5792.48]  that Mr. Doherty posted
[5792.48 --> 5793.00]  to Instagram
[5793.00 --> 5793.82]  appear to show him
[5793.82 --> 5794.70]  posing shirtless
[5794.70 --> 5795.36]  with the wreck.
[5796.02 --> 5796.76]  Note that he was
[5796.76 --> 5797.60]  wearing a shirt
[5797.60 --> 5799.06]  when the accident occurred.
[5799.06 --> 5802.06]  Some online observers
[5802.06 --> 5803.42]  noted that Doherty
[5803.42 --> 5805.32]  re-uploaded edited clips
[5805.32 --> 5805.94]  of the aftermath
[5805.94 --> 5806.56]  of the accident,
[5806.82 --> 5808.06]  but not his actions
[5808.06 --> 5809.60]  immediately preceding the crash,
[5809.68 --> 5810.48]  so it wasn't obvious
[5810.48 --> 5811.54]  that he was on his phone.
[5812.54 --> 5813.66]  This is why this is on topic.
[5814.10 --> 5815.06]  Streaming site Kik
[5815.06 --> 5817.36]  has removed his account
[5817.36 --> 5818.00]  and given him
[5818.00 --> 5819.14]  a lifetime ban
[5819.14 --> 5820.00]  for violating
[5820.00 --> 5821.10]  a community guideline
[5821.10 --> 5822.52]  prohibiting reckless behavior
[5822.52 --> 5823.94]  and the endangerment
[5823.94 --> 5825.12]  of others.
[5825.82 --> 5827.62]  So this is actually
[5827.62 --> 5828.66]  what I want to talk about.
[5829.06 --> 5832.52]  Have we found the line?
[5833.42 --> 5834.76]  And if this is the line,
[5835.30 --> 5836.70]  why wasn't the line
[5836.70 --> 5839.00]  setting off fireworks indoors?
[5839.72 --> 5840.40]  Oh, did that happen?
[5840.84 --> 5843.48]  Not from whatever his name is.
[5843.50 --> 5843.62]  Not him?
[5843.68 --> 5844.88]  Not from Jack, no,
[5845.00 --> 5846.56]  but that's definitely
[5846.56 --> 5847.60]  something that has
[5847.60 --> 5848.94]  actually occurred.
[5849.12 --> 5849.66]  Did you see the stuff
[5849.66 --> 5850.50]  that happened at TwitchCon?
[5851.00 --> 5851.44]  No.
[5851.72 --> 5852.36]  Oh, yeah.
[5852.88 --> 5853.24]  Why?
[5853.56 --> 5854.72]  Kik streamers were just like
[5854.72 --> 5855.94]  straight up harassing people
[5855.94 --> 5856.52]  at TwitchCon.
[5857.26 --> 5857.70]  Cool.
[5857.82 --> 5858.38]  It's very cool.
[5859.06 --> 5859.56]  Very cool.
[5859.64 --> 5859.98]  Very cool.
[5860.22 --> 5862.02]  Kik is not Microsoft
[5862.02 --> 5862.86]  D-Star Fire.
[5863.10 --> 5864.68]  Not that any form
[5864.68 --> 5865.54]  of content creation
[5865.54 --> 5866.30]  is honestly like
[5866.30 --> 5867.78]  just a bastion
[5867.78 --> 5868.62]  of perfect people.
[5869.54 --> 5869.80]  No.
[5870.00 --> 5871.16]  But I think Kik
[5871.16 --> 5873.02]  has a pretty bad rap
[5873.02 --> 5873.52]  for a reason.
[5873.52 --> 5878.84]  And the indoor fireworks thing
[5878.84 --> 5880.10]  was actually not.
[5881.40 --> 5882.58]  That was not on Kik.
[5882.62 --> 5883.42]  I think that was on Twitch.
[5884.42 --> 5886.28]  So I guess the conversation
[5886.28 --> 5887.34]  is like,
[5887.56 --> 5888.60]  have we finally
[5888.60 --> 5890.86]  reached the line?
[5891.52 --> 5892.48]  Because as someone...
[5892.48 --> 5893.10]  Wait, indoor fireworks thing,
[5893.18 --> 5894.08]  that was KSI, right?
[5894.14 --> 5895.04]  That was fake.
[5896.40 --> 5897.28]  Someone definitely
[5897.28 --> 5898.52]  actually did it at some point.
[5898.52 --> 5898.82]  Oh, okay.
[5898.82 --> 5899.34]  I don't know who.
[5899.60 --> 5899.78]  All right.
[5901.46 --> 5902.18]  The KSI one,
[5902.40 --> 5903.46]  or not KSI, yeah,
[5903.54 --> 5904.32]  sorry, Kaisenat.
[5904.64 --> 5905.46]  That one was,
[5905.58 --> 5906.66]  I think it was a Mr. Beast
[5906.66 --> 5907.94]  and Kaisenat thing
[5907.94 --> 5908.82]  and it was faked.
[5909.44 --> 5909.64]  Yeah.
[5910.00 --> 5911.32]  Someone definitely
[5911.32 --> 5912.68]  did it at some point.
[5914.76 --> 5915.18]  Apparently,
[5915.30 --> 5915.78]  iShowSpeed
[5915.78 --> 5916.60]  actually did it.
[5916.70 --> 5916.90]  Oh.
[5917.02 --> 5917.46]  Says chat.
[5917.70 --> 5917.96]  Okay.
[5918.20 --> 5918.72]  So, cool.
[5919.30 --> 5919.70]  Anyway,
[5919.90 --> 5920.78]  the point is that
[5920.78 --> 5922.26]  as someone who grew up
[5922.26 --> 5923.22]  in the generation
[5923.22 --> 5924.70]  of like,
[5924.96 --> 5926.42]  when I was a kid
[5926.42 --> 5927.80]  heading into adolescence
[5927.80 --> 5928.74]  and teenagehood,
[5928.98 --> 5929.90]  like CKY.
[5930.48 --> 5931.12]  To become a man,
[5931.22 --> 5932.16]  you have to crash your McLaren.
[5932.38 --> 5932.82]  Jackass.
[5932.82 --> 5933.38]  Back in the day.
[5933.70 --> 5934.42]  Tom Green.
[5935.02 --> 5935.92]  This kind of like,
[5936.02 --> 5936.96]  this kind of shock,
[5937.16 --> 5938.82]  do anything humor.
[5939.20 --> 5939.40]  Yeah.
[5939.76 --> 5941.36]  I've kind of watched it
[5941.36 --> 5942.72]  progress
[5942.72 --> 5944.30]  to the point where,
[5944.54 --> 5944.86]  you know,
[5944.98 --> 5946.58]  we stopped doing these things
[5946.58 --> 5948.22]  under professional supervision
[5948.22 --> 5949.24]  on closed courses.
[5949.24 --> 5951.54]  we started doing
[5951.54 --> 5953.16]  more and more,
[5953.44 --> 5954.64]  not just insane,
[5954.84 --> 5956.80]  but inane things.
[5957.30 --> 5959.42]  I saw this really unsettling footage
[5959.42 --> 5961.86]  of someone breaking their back
[5961.86 --> 5963.40]  doing the milk crate challenge.
[5964.44 --> 5964.98]  What is that?
[5965.50 --> 5966.70]  You stack milk crates
[5966.70 --> 5967.56]  to make stairs.
[5968.38 --> 5968.68]  Okay.
[5968.82 --> 5969.20]  Like, you know,
[5969.24 --> 5970.22]  those square milk crates.
[5970.40 --> 5971.32]  And then you see
[5971.32 --> 5972.56]  how high you can go.
[5972.70 --> 5973.80]  Except that the problem is
[5973.80 --> 5974.54]  that by the time
[5974.54 --> 5975.08]  you're high enough
[5975.08 --> 5975.80]  that it's unstable,
[5975.96 --> 5977.72]  you're like six to eight feet up.
[5977.96 --> 5979.02]  And if you fall,
[5979.02 --> 5980.34]  onto milk crates.
[5982.06 --> 5983.08]  That should give you
[5983.08 --> 5984.30]  like a pretty good idea
[5984.30 --> 5986.20]  of what's going to happen.
[5987.56 --> 5988.52]  And I guess
[5988.52 --> 5989.40]  I've just been kind of
[5989.40 --> 5989.96]  sitting here
[5989.96 --> 5991.20]  patiently waiting
[5991.20 --> 5992.74]  for either people
[5992.74 --> 5993.50]  to get smarter,
[5993.78 --> 5994.06]  which
[5994.06 --> 5995.54]  I'll probably be waiting
[5995.54 --> 5996.22]  a long time.
[5996.38 --> 5996.58]  Yeah.
[5996.84 --> 5997.56]  Or for
[5997.56 --> 5999.20]  whether it's platforms,
[5999.56 --> 6000.14]  regulators,
[6000.14 --> 6001.06]  or parents,
[6001.14 --> 6001.74]  I don't know,
[6001.84 --> 6002.54]  for someone
[6002.54 --> 6003.66]  to kind of say,
[6004.34 --> 6004.86]  hey, okay,
[6005.52 --> 6008.10]  that's the limit.
[6009.84 --> 6011.06]  That's the limit there.
[6011.98 --> 6013.24]  It's time to stop.
[6015.12 --> 6017.42]  And is this finally it?
[6017.66 --> 6018.84]  So operating your phone
[6018.84 --> 6019.40]  while driving
[6019.40 --> 6019.94]  is the limit?
[6020.98 --> 6021.28]  Well,
[6021.44 --> 6022.22]  the thing is that
[6022.22 --> 6023.06]  I don't even know
[6023.06 --> 6024.02]  if that's...
[6024.02 --> 6026.24]  And to be clear,
[6026.34 --> 6027.48]  it's dumb and reckless
[6027.48 --> 6029.40]  because you're streaming,
[6029.86 --> 6030.30]  driving,
[6030.64 --> 6031.44]  poor conditions,
[6031.76 --> 6033.30]  and operating a phone.
[6033.48 --> 6034.20]  And then I think
[6034.20 --> 6036.40]  that's already bad,
[6036.84 --> 6037.92]  but I think it's sort of
[6037.92 --> 6038.28]  the flagrant...
[6038.28 --> 6039.12]  But which parts are bad?
[6039.16 --> 6040.42]  Because we've recorded videos
[6040.42 --> 6040.98]  while driving,
[6041.06 --> 6042.68]  so is the streaming portion bad?
[6042.68 --> 6044.52]  It's the flagrant disregard,
[6044.96 --> 6045.38]  I think,
[6045.50 --> 6047.22]  for any kind of consequences
[6047.22 --> 6049.38]  after the fact.
[6049.38 --> 6050.56]  But that's an impossible
[6050.56 --> 6051.30]  thing to measure.
[6052.32 --> 6053.22]  No, you're right.
[6053.32 --> 6054.48]  It's totally impossible
[6054.48 --> 6055.76]  to measure.
[6055.86 --> 6056.04]  I mean,
[6056.14 --> 6057.96]  it's a compound problem,
[6058.04 --> 6058.28]  I think.
[6058.40 --> 6059.12]  Context menu,
[6059.20 --> 6059.46]  I think,
[6059.52 --> 6060.16]  kind of nailed it.
[6060.58 --> 6061.70]  Any one of those things,
[6061.82 --> 6062.10]  you know,
[6062.32 --> 6063.58]  I would say is
[6063.58 --> 6065.20]  compared to the
[6065.20 --> 6066.08]  kind of stuff
[6066.08 --> 6067.00]  other people
[6067.00 --> 6067.66]  are streaming online,
[6067.74 --> 6067.88]  right?
[6067.90 --> 6068.76]  Because we're not talking
[6068.76 --> 6069.52]  about whether those things
[6069.52 --> 6070.22]  were wrong and bad.
[6070.76 --> 6071.88]  Absolutely wrong and bad.
[6072.56 --> 6073.78]  What we're talking about is...
[6073.78 --> 6074.44]  Is streaming while driving
[6074.44 --> 6075.18]  wrong and bad?
[6075.26 --> 6075.80]  The line.
[6076.36 --> 6077.60]  I don't think it has to be.
[6078.24 --> 6078.36]  Okay.
[6078.36 --> 6078.98]  I think if you have
[6078.98 --> 6080.46]  a fixed GoPro on your dash
[6080.46 --> 6082.20]  and you're...
[6082.20 --> 6083.10]  It's basically the same thing
[6083.10 --> 6084.02]  as talking on the phone.
[6084.06 --> 6085.14]  It's basically comedians
[6085.14 --> 6086.06]  in cars or whatever.
[6086.12 --> 6086.80]  Yeah, exactly.
[6086.94 --> 6087.34]  Like Seinfeld.
[6087.46 --> 6088.66]  Like, I don't think...
[6088.66 --> 6089.36]  Because I don't think
[6089.36 --> 6090.70]  I've ever been
[6090.70 --> 6091.90]  in a compromised position
[6091.90 --> 6092.58]  driving around
[6092.58 --> 6093.40]  for Scrap Red Wars.
[6093.62 --> 6094.18]  You know what I mean?
[6094.18 --> 6095.78]  Like, it hasn't...
[6095.78 --> 6096.34]  There's this,
[6096.40 --> 6096.94]  there's this,
[6096.94 --> 6097.16]  like,
[6097.42 --> 6098.72]  super low-budget
[6098.72 --> 6099.50]  Canadian show
[6099.50 --> 6100.36]  that I only know about
[6100.36 --> 6101.24]  because it was on
[6101.24 --> 6102.66]  while I was in a dentist chair
[6102.66 --> 6103.70]  and I couldn't get away from it.
[6103.94 --> 6104.94]  It's called, like,
[6105.10 --> 6105.82]  Cash Cab
[6105.82 --> 6107.36]  or something like that.
[6107.42 --> 6108.16]  Yeah, here we go.
[6108.48 --> 6108.80]  Is it...
[6108.80 --> 6109.42]  Oh my God,
[6109.44 --> 6110.46]  it's an American show.
[6110.56 --> 6111.64]  It's actually a whole thing.
[6111.72 --> 6111.90]  Well,
[6112.68 --> 6113.44]  there was a...
[6113.44 --> 6113.94]  There was a...
[6113.94 --> 6114.50]  I have no idea.
[6116.80 --> 6117.44]  Okay, well,
[6117.52 --> 6118.36]  it was definitely
[6118.36 --> 6119.64]  on a Canadian channel
[6119.64 --> 6120.74]  and they were definitely
[6120.74 --> 6121.34]  driving around
[6121.34 --> 6122.04]  a Canadian city
[6122.04 --> 6122.60]  and it was, like,
[6122.62 --> 6123.42]  the production value
[6123.42 --> 6124.24]  was garbage.
[6125.30 --> 6126.56]  So I think it must have been,
[6126.68 --> 6126.76]  like,
[6126.78 --> 6128.14]  a Canadian rip-off of it.
[6128.14 --> 6128.92]  Oh yeah,
[6129.30 --> 6129.76]  Cash Cab
[6129.76 --> 6130.72]  Canadian game show.
[6131.00 --> 6132.00]  It's called the same thing
[6132.00 --> 6133.20]  but there's a Canadian one.
[6133.42 --> 6133.62]  Yeah,
[6133.72 --> 6134.24]  and it's, like,
[6134.32 --> 6135.06]  probably worse
[6135.06 --> 6136.62]  because it seemed pretty bad.
[6136.70 --> 6137.30]  Anyway...
[6137.30 --> 6138.66]  200 plus episodes,
[6138.80 --> 6139.48]  eight seasons.
[6139.70 --> 6139.94]  Yeah.
[6140.08 --> 6140.64]  Whoa.
[6140.74 --> 6140.90]  Yeah,
[6141.20 --> 6142.04]  the Canadian one?
[6142.16 --> 6142.40]  Yeah.
[6142.66 --> 6143.18]  Anyway,
[6144.06 --> 6145.58]  you're really trying
[6145.58 --> 6146.44]  to get cancelled.
[6146.76 --> 6147.06]  Come on.
[6147.16 --> 6147.68]  Okay, look,
[6148.14 --> 6149.98]  I'm not saying that...
[6149.98 --> 6150.18]  Okay.
[6151.04 --> 6151.92]  The point is...
[6152.80 --> 6153.78]  The point is
[6153.78 --> 6154.78]  that clearly
[6154.78 --> 6155.58]  they're driving
[6155.58 --> 6156.36]  and, like,
[6156.86 --> 6158.08]  doing a trivia show.
[6158.80 --> 6159.12]  So,
[6159.42 --> 6160.50]  it can be done.
[6161.28 --> 6161.80]  Yeah.
[6163.80 --> 6165.60]  But not in poor conditions.
[6166.20 --> 6167.72]  Not while also texting.
[6168.38 --> 6168.98]  Not while...
[6168.98 --> 6169.78]  Not in poor conditions?
[6169.98 --> 6171.10]  So you can't, like...
[6171.10 --> 6171.66]  This is...
[6171.66 --> 6172.42]  I think this is the line
[6172.42 --> 6173.20]  I keep coming back to.
[6173.36 --> 6173.66]  It's like,
[6173.72 --> 6174.34]  does that mean
[6174.34 --> 6175.10]  that we can't film
[6175.10 --> 6176.02]  for Scrapyard Wars
[6176.02 --> 6176.92]  while driving
[6176.92 --> 6177.48]  when it's raining?
[6177.48 --> 6180.56]  Because, like,
[6180.60 --> 6181.44]  I don't personally
[6181.44 --> 6182.20]  see the difference
[6182.20 --> 6183.40]  between streaming
[6183.40 --> 6184.82]  and recording a VOD.
[6184.86 --> 6185.42]  I think we'd have
[6185.42 --> 6186.24]  to use our GameSense.
[6186.30 --> 6187.08]  No, there's a big difference
[6187.08 --> 6187.62]  between streaming
[6187.62 --> 6188.28]  and recording a VOD
[6188.28 --> 6190.32]  because with streaming...
[6190.32 --> 6190.70]  Okay, here.
[6190.80 --> 6191.60]  I'll show you the difference
[6191.60 --> 6192.18]  between streaming
[6192.18 --> 6192.94]  and recording a VOD.
[6193.00 --> 6193.18]  Sure.
[6198.82 --> 6199.44]  Well, no,
[6199.52 --> 6200.20]  because you don't have
[6200.20 --> 6200.94]  to go on your phone.
[6200.96 --> 6201.78]  I'm showing you the difference.
[6202.32 --> 6203.10]  You don't have
[6203.10 --> 6203.80]  to go on your phone.
[6204.00 --> 6204.68]  Oh, I'm showing you
[6204.68 --> 6205.08]  the difference.
[6207.48 --> 6211.32]  What are you doing?
[6215.26 --> 6215.66]  Okay.
[6216.36 --> 6217.58]  So, continuing with the show,
[6217.84 --> 6218.76]  I can take a break.
[6219.12 --> 6219.46]  Gotcha.
[6219.64 --> 6221.30]  If I need my focus...
[6221.30 --> 6222.60]  You can just be a bad streamer
[6222.60 --> 6223.36]  and take a break, though.
[6223.52 --> 6224.54]  But you won't
[6224.54 --> 6226.10]  because when you're streaming...
[6227.16 --> 6228.24]  Right, but how many...
[6228.24 --> 6230.38]  What's your typical concurrence, okay?
[6233.68 --> 6235.06]  Like, you're not fighting
[6235.06 --> 6236.02]  algorithmically
[6236.02 --> 6237.38]  for...
[6237.38 --> 6237.52]  Yeah.
[6237.52 --> 6238.16]  ...for relevance, really.
[6238.16 --> 6238.86]  This isn't my thing.
[6238.90 --> 6239.62]  You don't care.
[6239.78 --> 6240.06]  Yeah, yeah.
[6240.30 --> 6241.80]  And so, when you're streaming,
[6242.00 --> 6243.56]  there's this constant pressure
[6243.56 --> 6244.34]  to be on,
[6244.64 --> 6245.68]  to be talking about something,
[6245.80 --> 6246.90]  to be changing the subject,
[6247.16 --> 6247.96]  to be, you know,
[6248.04 --> 6248.98]  changing what people
[6248.98 --> 6249.54]  are looking at.
[6249.56 --> 6250.00]  Oh, my God,
[6250.04 --> 6250.78]  it's Producer Dan.
[6250.98 --> 6251.84]  Oh, Andy's gone.
[6252.06 --> 6252.92]  But, like, I think that's...
[6252.92 --> 6254.24]  I think that's my...
[6254.24 --> 6255.12]  Where I said, like,
[6255.12 --> 6255.72]  you don't have to go
[6255.72 --> 6256.16]  on your phone
[6256.16 --> 6256.64]  because, like,
[6256.68 --> 6257.14]  if you're streaming,
[6257.14 --> 6257.92]  you're going to want
[6257.92 --> 6258.44]  to see chat,
[6258.66 --> 6259.90]  but someone else
[6259.90 --> 6260.78]  could see chat.
[6261.12 --> 6262.40]  Someone else could be producing.
[6262.86 --> 6263.62]  Someone else could be
[6263.62 --> 6264.38]  doing these other things.
[6264.60 --> 6264.68]  Yeah, yeah.
[6264.68 --> 6265.94]  Someone else could be making sure
[6265.94 --> 6267.02]  that there isn't gaps
[6267.02 --> 6267.62]  in the entertainment
[6267.62 --> 6268.30]  of the stream.
[6268.52 --> 6269.48]  But that's the problem
[6269.48 --> 6270.86]  is they didn't.
[6271.12 --> 6272.50]  So it's a compound problem.
[6272.74 --> 6273.94]  Samet has streamed
[6273.94 --> 6274.56]  while drifting
[6274.56 --> 6276.08]  and not had a problem.
[6276.36 --> 6276.56]  Yeah.
[6276.72 --> 6278.14]  And so I'm not saying
[6278.14 --> 6280.12]  that just being on stream
[6280.12 --> 6281.14]  is necessarily a problem,
[6281.14 --> 6281.86]  but you have to have
[6281.86 --> 6282.56]  the game sense.
[6282.70 --> 6283.50]  And that, to me,
[6283.50 --> 6284.02]  is the difference
[6284.02 --> 6284.54]  with a VOD.
[6284.62 --> 6285.14]  With a VOD,
[6285.20 --> 6286.32]  I think it's easier
[6286.32 --> 6288.06]  to turn on your game sense
[6288.06 --> 6289.14]  and go,
[6290.08 --> 6290.72]  okay,
[6291.30 --> 6292.56]  I got an update for you.
[6294.82 --> 6296.42]  We got to merge
[6296.42 --> 6297.04]  onto the highway.
[6297.24 --> 6298.24]  Let's do it
[6298.24 --> 6299.18]  when we're on the highway.
[6299.72 --> 6300.12]  Because, like,
[6300.16 --> 6301.30]  I've had that kind of
[6301.30 --> 6301.84]  back and forth
[6301.84 --> 6302.80]  with my camera operator.
[6302.92 --> 6303.08]  I have too, yeah.
[6303.22 --> 6304.64]  Where, like, okay,
[6304.76 --> 6305.74]  one example was
[6305.74 --> 6306.90]  I was going somewhere
[6306.90 --> 6308.36]  where I didn't want to
[6308.36 --> 6309.20]  dox the person
[6309.20 --> 6310.24]  I was traveling to.
[6310.50 --> 6311.48]  Yep, I've done that too.
[6311.50 --> 6312.36]  And so I was like,
[6312.42 --> 6312.68]  okay,
[6313.40 --> 6313.84]  I've got to,
[6314.20 --> 6314.74]  okay, write down,
[6314.88 --> 6315.60]  there's a few things
[6315.60 --> 6316.16]  I want to address
[6316.16 --> 6316.90]  in this next clip.
[6316.90 --> 6318.42]  If you can note those down.
[6319.32 --> 6320.10]  And then I'm going to
[6320.10 --> 6321.16]  turn around on this highway
[6321.16 --> 6323.70]  so that from the last shot
[6323.70 --> 6324.30]  that they see,
[6324.40 --> 6325.00]  we'll be going in,
[6325.06 --> 6325.88]  like, two different directions
[6325.88 --> 6326.54]  and it's going to be
[6326.54 --> 6327.58]  super bamboozily.
[6328.76 --> 6329.12]  Points,
[6329.16 --> 6329.94]  if anybody, like,
[6330.02 --> 6331.16]  noticed that in the video.
[6331.42 --> 6332.10]  It was pretty funny.
[6332.80 --> 6333.12]  Anyway,
[6334.12 --> 6335.78]  so let's do that.
[6335.94 --> 6336.22]  And then,
[6336.22 --> 6336.78]  and then,
[6336.86 --> 6337.24]  you know what?
[6337.78 --> 6338.42]  I'm not going to,
[6338.42 --> 6339.58]  I'm not going to lie to you guys,
[6339.64 --> 6340.20]  especially because
[6340.20 --> 6341.58]  in earlier Scrapyard Wars,
[6341.66 --> 6342.44]  you guys probably saw me
[6342.44 --> 6342.88]  on my phone
[6342.88 --> 6343.80]  while I was driving anyway.
[6344.36 --> 6345.66]  So I'll, like,
[6345.84 --> 6346.50]  glance at it
[6346.50 --> 6346.98]  and then,
[6347.08 --> 6347.26]  okay,
[6347.28 --> 6347.94]  let's do the clip
[6347.94 --> 6349.40]  while we're just cruising
[6349.40 --> 6350.18]  at highway speed.
[6350.42 --> 6352.20]  I am a very defensive driver
[6352.20 --> 6353.22]  so I will,
[6353.36 --> 6354.04]  I will typically
[6354.04 --> 6355.60]  not have anyone
[6355.60 --> 6356.64]  on either side of me.
[6356.78 --> 6357.96]  I will always accelerate
[6357.96 --> 6358.66]  past someone
[6358.66 --> 6360.24]  or brake to be behind them.
[6360.40 --> 6360.72]  Like, I never.
[6360.72 --> 6361.12]  Do you decide someone
[6361.12 --> 6362.02]  feels so uncomfortable?
[6362.24 --> 6362.62]  I hate it.
[6362.66 --> 6363.38]  Oh my God.
[6363.38 --> 6369.06]  I apparently got a ticket
[6369.06 --> 6369.76]  and left it in.
[6369.86 --> 6370.78]  I forgot about that.
[6371.26 --> 6372.46]  I don't remember that at all.
[6372.86 --> 6373.28]  That's hilarious.
[6373.28 --> 6376.18]  Anyway, so,
[6376.58 --> 6377.74]  so I tend to be
[6377.74 --> 6379.78]  a very defensive driver.
[6380.02 --> 6380.28]  That doesn't,
[6380.36 --> 6381.02]  I'm not saying
[6381.02 --> 6381.86]  good driver, guys.
[6381.86 --> 6382.24]  I'm saying
[6382.24 --> 6383.02]  defensive driver.
[6383.36 --> 6384.58]  I don't like to be near
[6384.58 --> 6385.36]  other things
[6385.36 --> 6385.86]  that are moving.
[6385.86 --> 6389.26]  And so,
[6389.38 --> 6390.76]  if I'm at cruising speed
[6390.76 --> 6392.62]  and there's nobody near me,
[6392.72 --> 6392.90]  no,
[6393.00 --> 6393.54]  I don't think
[6393.54 --> 6394.32]  that it's going to be
[6394.32 --> 6395.16]  the end of the world
[6395.16 --> 6396.06]  if I,
[6396.14 --> 6397.50]  if I like glance
[6397.50 --> 6398.60]  toward my glimps
[6398.60 --> 6399.58]  for,
[6399.78 --> 6400.84]  for a second or two,
[6400.96 --> 6401.24]  you know,
[6401.28 --> 6401.80]  for emphasis
[6401.80 --> 6402.38]  or, you know,
[6402.38 --> 6403.24]  for whatever it is
[6403.24 --> 6403.94]  that I'm doing hosting.
[6404.16 --> 6404.32]  It's the same thing
[6404.32 --> 6405.10]  as glancing towards
[6405.10 --> 6405.62]  your passenger,
[6405.82 --> 6406.68]  which everybody does.
[6406.76 --> 6407.56]  But streaming
[6407.56 --> 6409.56]  is in my mind
[6409.56 --> 6410.36]  a different beast
[6410.36 --> 6411.28]  unless you're really
[6411.28 --> 6411.94]  in a mindset
[6411.94 --> 6413.60]  where you are,
[6413.74 --> 6414.86]  you're not trying
[6414.86 --> 6416.04]  to be on the whole time,
[6416.10 --> 6417.60]  but so many streamers are.
[6418.46 --> 6419.14]  They're trying to be
[6419.14 --> 6420.22]  constantly engaging.
[6420.22 --> 6420.52]  If that's your thing,
[6420.80 --> 6421.98]  you probably are
[6421.98 --> 6422.80]  trying to constantly
[6422.80 --> 6423.32]  be engaging
[6423.32 --> 6424.48]  because that's how you
[6424.48 --> 6426.18]  perform in the streaming world,
[6426.26 --> 6426.94]  which makes sense.
[6428.62 --> 6429.44]  SigmaSalt says,
[6429.62 --> 6431.08]  unless you're ignoring chat,
[6431.42 --> 6432.82]  it's over the line 100%.
[6432.82 --> 6433.92]  I think that's honestly
[6433.92 --> 6435.38]  a pretty good point.
[6436.84 --> 6437.68]  Where'd it go?
[6438.16 --> 6438.90]  Having his friend
[6438.90 --> 6439.82]  recording the aftermath
[6439.82 --> 6440.56]  while bleeding
[6440.56 --> 6441.84]  also didn't help.
[6441.94 --> 6442.34]  Yeah.
[6442.78 --> 6443.54]  Crystal D said,
[6443.62 --> 6444.00]  but the issue
[6444.00 --> 6444.52]  was speeding,
[6444.68 --> 6445.52]  looking at his phone,
[6445.98 --> 6446.98]  and doing that
[6446.98 --> 6447.74]  while hydroplaning.
[6447.96 --> 6449.00]  And I understand that.
[6449.04 --> 6449.94]  My point is that
[6449.94 --> 6452.34]  if we try to draw a line,
[6452.44 --> 6453.40]  but the line is like,
[6453.46 --> 6453.96]  I don't know,
[6454.18 --> 6455.10]  then it's not a line.
[6456.00 --> 6457.22]  So we need to define
[6457.22 --> 6457.84]  the things
[6457.84 --> 6459.24]  that cross the line.
[6459.66 --> 6460.02]  So like,
[6460.16 --> 6461.24]  you're saying like,
[6461.76 --> 6462.78]  maybe streaming sites
[6462.78 --> 6463.82]  should ban
[6463.82 --> 6465.26]  streaming while driving.
[6466.10 --> 6467.02]  I don't know.
[6467.42 --> 6468.40]  While being the driver.
[6468.76 --> 6469.12]  I mean,
[6469.32 --> 6470.22]  can we...
[6470.22 --> 6472.54]  I don't necessarily
[6472.54 --> 6473.48]  think it's inherently
[6473.48 --> 6474.04]  a problem.
[6475.30 --> 6477.10]  No, I am 100% certain
[6477.10 --> 6478.12]  that even if I tried
[6478.12 --> 6479.26]  to be consistently entertaining,
[6479.40 --> 6479.98]  I could stream
[6479.98 --> 6480.84]  and drive at the same time.
[6480.88 --> 6481.26]  No problem.
[6482.80 --> 6484.22]  I'm 100% confident.
[6484.36 --> 6484.96]  You wouldn't be able
[6484.96 --> 6485.84]  to be engaging
[6485.84 --> 6486.88]  and entertaining though.
[6487.28 --> 6488.38]  With other people
[6488.38 --> 6489.36]  in the car though.
[6489.44 --> 6490.00]  With the other people
[6490.00 --> 6490.38]  in the car,
[6490.52 --> 6490.98]  easy.
[6491.26 --> 6491.50]  Yeah.
[6491.68 --> 6492.38]  Easy peasy.
[6492.56 --> 6493.42]  If there's no one else
[6493.42 --> 6493.88]  in the car,
[6494.04 --> 6495.12]  I do agree with you.
[6495.28 --> 6495.52]  Yeah.
[6495.52 --> 6496.42]  Because then you're,
[6496.54 --> 6496.70]  you know,
[6496.74 --> 6497.44]  you're not reading chat.
[6497.54 --> 6498.54]  Unless you're doing something,
[6498.66 --> 6499.30]  like unless you're like
[6499.30 --> 6500.40]  a rally driver,
[6500.68 --> 6502.08]  a drift car person,
[6502.40 --> 6504.40]  doing something unique.
[6504.40 --> 6505.18]  If you're driving
[6505.18 --> 6505.86]  through a city,
[6506.00 --> 6507.16]  unless your stream
[6507.16 --> 6508.90]  literally is like POV,
[6509.00 --> 6509.76]  driving through city.
[6509.94 --> 6510.20]  Yeah.
[6510.76 --> 6511.20]  Then,
[6511.46 --> 6511.74]  yeah,
[6511.80 --> 6512.22]  I don't know.
[6513.80 --> 6514.28]  Try it.
[6514.40 --> 6516.24]  I think I like literally have.
[6516.34 --> 6517.74]  I've streamed while snowboarding.
[6517.88 --> 6519.70]  Like I've done weird stuff
[6519.70 --> 6520.88]  and it's never been an issue for me.
[6520.88 --> 6524.78]  But I also have never had that be my career.
[6524.96 --> 6526.18]  So I have never cared.
[6526.38 --> 6528.46]  And if I needed to not be entertaining for a while,
[6528.48 --> 6530.00]  I would just not be entertaining for a while.
[6530.14 --> 6531.58]  So I also have that benefit,
[6531.74 --> 6532.70]  which isn't fair.
[6534.26 --> 6534.54]  Yeah.
[6535.30 --> 6537.72]  Is the line just like committing a crime while streaming?
[6537.94 --> 6538.10]  I'm,
[6538.70 --> 6541.02]  that's effectively the line for Flowplane.
[6541.16 --> 6542.12]  You can't break the law.
[6542.42 --> 6542.66]  Yeah.
[6542.72 --> 6543.52]  That's what we did.
[6543.78 --> 6544.08]  So,
[6544.34 --> 6544.62]  yeah.
[6545.98 --> 6546.38]  Yeah.
[6546.40 --> 6548.32]  I guess there's just a lot of things that like,
[6549.46 --> 6549.86]  are,
[6549.86 --> 6551.58]  horrible,
[6551.78 --> 6551.96]  but,
[6552.20 --> 6552.90]  and stupid,
[6553.10 --> 6553.98]  but not a crime.
[6554.18 --> 6554.44]  Like,
[6554.48 --> 6555.96]  I know I come back to this a fair bit,
[6556.02 --> 6557.64]  but it was just so egregious.
[6558.08 --> 6560.60]  Like when Dr. Disrespect was streaming from the bathroom.
[6561.30 --> 6563.22]  And I think it was at TwitchCon or whatever it was.
[6563.58 --> 6563.76]  Like,
[6563.80 --> 6564.12]  I don't,
[6564.20 --> 6567.74]  I don't think that's technically illegal necessarily,
[6568.04 --> 6569.98]  but it just shouldn't have to be,
[6570.24 --> 6570.48]  you know,
[6570.50 --> 6572.10]  you shouldn't have to make that law.
[6572.20 --> 6573.54]  It should just be kind of obvious.
[6573.98 --> 6577.90]  And I guess that's the problem for me is that we've got people just
[6577.90 --> 6578.74]  pushing,
[6578.74 --> 6581.08]  pushing the,
[6581.14 --> 6582.74]  the boundaries of what's,
[6583.44 --> 6583.90]  um,
[6585.50 --> 6585.80]  pushing,
[6585.92 --> 6586.64]  based on what is,
[6586.72 --> 6590.62]  what is legal rather than what is kind of necessary and,
[6590.62 --> 6591.66]  and okay to do.
[6592.02 --> 6592.42]  Uh,
[6592.42 --> 6595.12]  people are saying it's illegal as far as I'm aware.
[6595.20 --> 6595.36]  Okay.
[6595.40 --> 6595.66]  Maybe,
[6595.84 --> 6596.46]  maybe it is.
[6596.58 --> 6597.68]  So then record in a bathroom,
[6597.78 --> 6598.14]  you don't like,
[6598.22 --> 6599.82]  why was this a permanent band then?
[6599.86 --> 6601.14]  And why was that a temporary band?
[6601.18 --> 6601.34]  I mean,
[6601.34 --> 6603.50]  he ultimately did end up permanently banned anyway,
[6603.50 --> 6605.88]  but for a different thing,
[6605.88 --> 6606.24]  I think.
[6606.52 --> 6606.88]  Oh yeah.
[6606.88 --> 6607.76]  It was for something else.
[6608.10 --> 6608.50]  Um,
[6609.00 --> 6609.50]  I don't know,
[6609.54 --> 6609.72]  man.
[6609.76 --> 6610.18]  And like,
[6610.78 --> 6611.18]  should,
[6611.70 --> 6612.04]  okay.
[6612.06 --> 6614.44]  Should Jack Doherty be able to,
[6614.44 --> 6614.72]  you know,
[6614.72 --> 6617.74]  come back on Twitch or come back streaming on YouTube?
[6617.74 --> 6618.42]  Like should,
[6619.70 --> 6619.96]  should,
[6620.08 --> 6623.72]  because I know that YouTube has policies around off platform behavior.
[6623.72 --> 6628.50]  You don't necessarily have to do something on YouTube to be banned from YouTube.
[6629.18 --> 6629.26]  Yeah.
[6631.04 --> 6631.50]  Like,
[6631.56 --> 6632.00]  is this,
[6632.24 --> 6633.66]  should this just be the end?
[6633.70 --> 6635.44]  Because I don't know guys,
[6635.58 --> 6637.38]  for some reason,
[6637.38 --> 6643.46]  I don't feel like the audience will discipline this.
[6644.38 --> 6644.56]  Oh no,
[6644.66 --> 6644.96]  they'll,
[6645.20 --> 6645.46]  uh,
[6645.46 --> 6646.48]  traditionally they reward it.
[6646.64 --> 6648.30]  I've seen people come back from,
[6648.58 --> 6649.64]  from worse.
[6650.36 --> 6650.52]  I don't,
[6650.52 --> 6652.38]  I don't know when the lion,
[6652.38 --> 6653.46]  when we're way up here,
[6653.56 --> 6656.86]  it's hard to tell what's farther and what's not farther over the line.
[6656.94 --> 6658.14]  Like stuff that's just obviously wrong.
[6658.28 --> 6661.96]  If people were still watching this guy after all the stuff that he's done in the past,
[6662.62 --> 6662.88]  uh,
[6662.88 --> 6664.70]  I don't think this is going to stop them.
[6664.70 --> 6665.26]  If anything,
[6665.46 --> 6668.02]  this was probably top tier premium content,
[6668.16 --> 6670.20]  which is the reason why we're talking about it now.
[6670.36 --> 6675.76]  And the whole freaking internet has talked about it and he's getting more press than he's ever gotten before,
[6675.90 --> 6678.42]  despite all the crazy deplorable things he's done in the past.
[6678.60 --> 6679.22]  I'd never heard of him.
[6679.38 --> 6680.10]  I'll tell you that much.
[6680.22 --> 6680.62]  I have.
[6681.14 --> 6681.54]  Um,
[6681.54 --> 6682.18]  and,
[6682.18 --> 6683.26]  uh,
[6683.26 --> 6685.44]  if he's able to be platformed somewhere,
[6685.44 --> 6686.34]  he'll get tons of views.
[6686.94 --> 6687.18]  The,
[6687.26 --> 6687.82]  this is not,
[6687.98 --> 6690.64]  this is not generally penalized by the internet audience.
[6691.08 --> 6691.52]  Um,
[6691.52 --> 6692.60]  there's some people that would be like,
[6692.66 --> 6693.40]  I would.
[6693.80 --> 6694.20]  Yeah.
[6694.22 --> 6696.10]  But you weren't watching him.
[6696.80 --> 6697.20]  Yeah.
[6697.56 --> 6699.40]  Like it's not you.
[6701.06 --> 6701.74]  I don't know.
[6702.24 --> 6702.76]  It is what it is.
[6703.00 --> 6706.40]  I worry about the kinds of stuff that like,
[6706.40 --> 6707.20]  not my kids.
[6707.20 --> 6709.42]  Cause they like,
[6709.48 --> 6710.74]  I have access to their watch history.
[6710.74 --> 6711.44]  I know what they're watching.
[6711.80 --> 6712.14]  Um,
[6712.46 --> 6715.02]  but like what their peers are watching.
[6715.42 --> 6716.46]  What if they delete stuff?
[6717.18 --> 6717.60]  Um,
[6718.00 --> 6721.58]  they are,
[6721.72 --> 6728.54]  they have demonstrated their truthfulness elsewhere where it wouldn't be possible enough.
[6728.54 --> 6731.18]  And as far as they know,
[6731.18 --> 6732.96]  I can access things.
[6732.96 --> 6733.44]  They delete.
[6734.40 --> 6738.40]  As far as they know right now in time,
[6738.40 --> 6739.80]  they'll figure things out better.
[6740.02 --> 6740.50]  And,
[6740.66 --> 6741.24]  you know,
[6741.24 --> 6742.40]  I won't be able to rely on that,
[6742.40 --> 6743.04]  but for now,
[6743.52 --> 6743.86]  um,
[6743.90 --> 6746.88]  even in cases where I can't prove it,
[6747.32 --> 6747.70]  um,
[6747.80 --> 6750.62]  and where I don't necessarily have the power to know exactly what happened,
[6750.62 --> 6751.26]  uh,
[6751.26 --> 6753.78]  they have shown themselves to be extremely honest.
[6753.78 --> 6754.28]  And I,
[6754.38 --> 6757.96]  and I mean that as a parent with my eyes completely wide open,
[6757.96 --> 6761.34]  who knows that children are just little humans who lie,
[6761.50 --> 6761.70]  cheat,
[6761.84 --> 6762.06]  steal,
[6762.14 --> 6763.06]  and will even kill.
[6763.56 --> 6764.04]  Um,
[6764.14 --> 6764.38]  they're,
[6764.42 --> 6764.60]  they're,
[6764.64 --> 6765.20]  they're humans.
[6765.32 --> 6765.88]  They're just people.
[6766.02 --> 6766.60]  They're just smaller.
[6766.88 --> 6767.84]  I'm not saying this to,
[6767.96 --> 6769.90]  to say that the other ones aren't,
[6769.92 --> 6772.96]  I've just spent more time with this one and he's older,
[6772.96 --> 6776.96]  but little man is definitely intelligent and clever enough to figure it out.
[6776.96 --> 6777.82]  If he wanted to.
[6778.18 --> 6779.22]  And he has,
[6779.32 --> 6780.02]  um,
[6780.48 --> 6782.82]  he has bypassed parental controls before,
[6782.82 --> 6786.82]  and we have talked about it and he did get busted.
[6786.98 --> 6791.90]  And that's why he thinks that I know because I did catch him before.
[6791.90 --> 6793.96]  And it was a pretty clever workaround.
[6795.20 --> 6797.26]  That I was not aware of.
[6797.40 --> 6799.00]  Is it bad that I'm like a little proud?
[6804.24 --> 6805.26]  We can move on.
[6809.46 --> 6810.18]  Oh man,
[6810.24 --> 6810.74]  I forget.
[6810.90 --> 6813.58]  I actually forget what exactly the workaround was.
[6813.64 --> 6814.44]  I think it was,
[6814.50 --> 6814.84]  um,
[6814.88 --> 6816.24]  I think it was that the,
[6816.30 --> 6818.64]  the screen time wasn't counted.
[6819.14 --> 6822.48]  If you like quickly locked and unlocked the phone or something like that,
[6822.48 --> 6822.84]  or like,
[6822.92 --> 6823.74]  I forget what it was,
[6823.74 --> 6824.20]  but it was a,
[6824.20 --> 6825.52]  it was a pretty clever workaround.
[6826.52 --> 6826.96]  Um,
[6827.24 --> 6828.62]  but yeah,
[6828.68 --> 6828.86]  no,
[6828.96 --> 6829.26]  I,
[6829.42 --> 6829.78]  um,
[6832.22 --> 6832.72]  I,
[6832.94 --> 6833.42]  I,
[6833.66 --> 6838.52]  he's at the age now where instead of the conversation being,
[6838.52 --> 6840.62]  you need to be 100% honest all the time.
[6840.62 --> 6853.10]  The conversation is you need to learn the importance of honesty and you need to be man enough to be honest at times when it's hard.
[6853.10 --> 6855.38]  But no,
[6855.42 --> 6857.88]  I don't expect you to tell the truth to absolutely everyone in your life.
[6857.88 --> 6858.70]  100% of the time.
[6858.86 --> 6860.66]  Eventually you need to learn a lesson that you shouldn't.
[6860.88 --> 6861.00]  Yeah.
[6861.52 --> 6864.84]  Eventually you're going to need to learn to hold your cards closer to your chest.
[6864.92 --> 6865.36]  So we've,
[6865.62 --> 6866.00]  we've,
[6866.10 --> 6869.76]  he's headed into adolescence and we've started to have those conversations instead of just,
[6869.82 --> 6870.02]  I mean,
[6870.24 --> 6870.62]  it's like,
[6870.62 --> 6871.72]  there's appropriate time.
[6871.82 --> 6872.42]  It's like physics,
[6872.52 --> 6872.70]  right?
[6873.02 --> 6878.28]  Where you learn the laws of it and then you're ignoring air resistance and everything you learned was wrong.
[6878.42 --> 6878.64]  Yeah.
[6878.76 --> 6880.56]  And then you learn that everything you learned then was wrong.
[6880.58 --> 6881.96]  And then you learn that everything you learned then was wrong.
[6881.98 --> 6882.10]  Right?
[6882.10 --> 6882.26]  Like,
[6882.32 --> 6882.54]  like,
[6882.70 --> 6882.98]  you know,
[6883.00 --> 6884.72]  the early conversations with your kids are,
[6884.98 --> 6885.52]  you know,
[6885.56 --> 6885.76]  it,
[6885.82 --> 6886.38]  it doesn't,
[6886.38 --> 6888.08]  it doesn't matter if you win or lose,
[6888.08 --> 6888.58]  uh,
[6888.58 --> 6889.70]  as long as you try your best.
[6890.48 --> 6890.88]  Well,
[6891.04 --> 6891.42]  you know,
[6891.56 --> 6894.78]  probably about a year ago,
[6894.78 --> 6896.84]  maybe between a year and a year and a half ago,
[6896.84 --> 6898.90]  I had to have the first conversation with my son.
[6898.90 --> 6901.22]  So it's coming real soon for my eldest daughter.
[6901.38 --> 6902.24]  That was like,
[6902.40 --> 6902.58]  Hey,
[6902.76 --> 6903.50]  what I told you,
[6903.60 --> 6904.72]  that's actually bullshit.
[6905.46 --> 6905.90]  Um,
[6906.10 --> 6906.90]  in life,
[6906.94 --> 6907.92]  it matters if you win.
[6909.22 --> 6910.40]  If you didn't win,
[6910.66 --> 6911.26]  you lost.
[6911.96 --> 6912.40]  Um,
[6912.46 --> 6913.84]  and if you tried really hard,
[6914.42 --> 6915.00]  um,
[6915.00 --> 6916.80]  you still lost.
[6917.60 --> 6918.00]  And,
[6918.12 --> 6918.28]  you know,
[6918.34 --> 6918.98]  I think it was,
[6919.04 --> 6920.52]  I think it was after a tournament or something.
[6920.52 --> 6921.52]  And he was like,
[6922.02 --> 6922.32]  uh,
[6922.32 --> 6923.02]  I was tired.
[6923.24 --> 6924.50]  And to make my point,
[6924.62 --> 6927.36]  I brought up like some,
[6927.64 --> 6927.98]  some,
[6927.98 --> 6930.02]  someone who lost like a major match.
[6930.62 --> 6931.50]  And I was like,
[6931.70 --> 6931.88]  Hey,
[6931.92 --> 6932.20]  look,
[6932.56 --> 6933.40]  have you seen this?
[6933.96 --> 6934.36]  Uh,
[6934.46 --> 6935.30]  on the results,
[6935.30 --> 6936.22]  it says that,
[6936.30 --> 6937.32]  that the score was this,
[6937.42 --> 6938.90]  but this guy was tired here.
[6938.96 --> 6939.22]  Look.
[6939.88 --> 6940.50]  And he goes,
[6940.52 --> 6941.24]  it doesn't say that.
[6941.28 --> 6941.60]  I said,
[6941.62 --> 6941.76]  yeah,
[6941.80 --> 6942.16]  exactly.
[6945.00 --> 6946.56]  Yeah.
[6947.52 --> 6947.88]  Yeah.
[6948.00 --> 6950.36]  It doesn't say his tummy hurt because nobody cares.
[6951.42 --> 6951.78]  Um,
[6952.18 --> 6957.06]  at some point you're going to need to win and it's not going to matter.
[6957.14 --> 6958.20]  Nothing else is going to matter.
[6958.22 --> 6959.04]  If you want to win,
[6959.28 --> 6962.10]  then you're going to have to leave everything else at the door.
[6962.10 --> 6962.68]  And you can,
[6962.78 --> 6964.26]  you can understand as well.
[6964.36 --> 6968.56]  Like you can basically decide that it's not worth the effort that you know,
[6968.56 --> 6970.78]  that you might have to put into this thing in order to win.
[6970.78 --> 6971.98]  And you can be like,
[6972.04 --> 6972.18]  okay,
[6972.18 --> 6976.10]  I'm going to accept that I'm at a certain level of casualness with this thing.
[6976.30 --> 6977.20]  But if you're like,
[6977.30 --> 6977.48]  no,
[6977.56 --> 6977.98]  this is,
[6978.10 --> 6979.36]  this is my thing.
[6979.46 --> 6980.20]  I must win.
[6980.66 --> 6981.40]  And it's like,
[6981.48 --> 6981.66]  well,
[6981.96 --> 6982.52]  then win.
[6982.90 --> 6983.24]  Yeah.
[6983.76 --> 6984.12]  Um,
[6984.30 --> 6984.98]  put in the effort.
[6985.08 --> 6985.32]  So yeah,
[6985.38 --> 6985.52]  we,
[6985.68 --> 6985.92]  you know,
[6985.94 --> 6986.52]  and I,
[6986.52 --> 6989.86]  I think we were also having the conversation about like school as well.
[6989.90 --> 6990.32]  It's like,
[6990.36 --> 6990.58]  look,
[6991.02 --> 6991.56]  you're right.
[6991.58 --> 6991.96]  You can,
[6992.16 --> 6993.64]  you can get a good enough grade,
[6993.64 --> 6997.46]  but at some point you're going to have to decide if good enough is good enough.
[6997.46 --> 7000.68]  Or if you want to excel,
[7000.68 --> 7001.54]  um,
[7001.54 --> 7002.18]  because like,
[7002.22 --> 7002.54]  let's,
[7002.74 --> 7003.36]  let's be real.
[7003.98 --> 7004.38]  Um,
[7004.82 --> 7008.68]  our kids have ended up with a really interesting mix of,
[7008.68 --> 7009.90]  of,
[7010.14 --> 7010.24]  well,
[7010.26 --> 7010.80]  their parents,
[7010.90 --> 7011.36]  obviously.
[7011.36 --> 7011.64]  Right.
[7011.64 --> 7013.14]  Cause that's like how genetics work.
[7013.58 --> 7014.06]  Um,
[7014.82 --> 7015.38]  and,
[7015.46 --> 7016.50]  and they've,
[7016.52 --> 7017.14]  they've got this,
[7017.22 --> 7022.20]  they've got this fascinating sort of spectrum that they sit on between the
[7022.20 --> 7026.38]  things that are great about my mind,
[7026.50 --> 7032.58]  which is sort of this raw creative dragon energy and things that are great about Yvonne's
[7032.58 --> 7032.88]  mind,
[7032.98 --> 7035.86]  which is this spectacular attention to detail.
[7036.48 --> 7037.04]  Um,
[7037.40 --> 7040.28]  and I think they have a lot of potential,
[7040.28 --> 7044.22]  but I think they have a lot of the same challenges that,
[7044.22 --> 7045.02]  um,
[7045.14 --> 7046.96]  I had and she had,
[7047.44 --> 7047.74]  um,
[7047.78 --> 7051.06]  and that she figured out and that I didn't until a lot later.
[7051.06 --> 7056.14]  And that's that it's hard to learn to work hard when you don't have to.
[7056.80 --> 7057.28]  Um,
[7057.32 --> 7060.86]  and Yvonne figured it out still when she was still in elementary school,
[7060.86 --> 7063.06]  like when she was pretty early,
[7063.16 --> 7063.50]  she,
[7063.68 --> 7064.12]  when they,
[7064.24 --> 7064.80]  when they basically,
[7064.80 --> 7067.88]  when they started giving out letter grades was,
[7067.98 --> 7070.06]  and she got bees and she was like,
[7070.22 --> 7070.92]  excuse me,
[7070.98 --> 7071.60]  what the fuck?
[7071.88 --> 7077.16]  I thought I was an a student and kind of cleaned up her act.
[7077.26 --> 7077.84]  Got it.
[7078.02 --> 7078.40]  Um,
[7078.74 --> 7079.74]  whereas for me,
[7079.90 --> 7080.86]  I,
[7081.06 --> 7082.06]  I don't know.
[7082.14 --> 7083.44]  I cleaned it up in late grade nine,
[7083.44 --> 7084.08]  I think,
[7084.34 --> 7086.74]  but then I completely fell apart.
[7087.00 --> 7087.48]  Um,
[7087.54 --> 7088.56]  when I started dating,
[7088.56 --> 7090.00]  just,
[7090.18 --> 7091.78]  just,
[7092.28 --> 7092.68]  yeah,
[7092.92 --> 7094.30]  not focused.
[7096.00 --> 7097.92]  Like flunked out of university,
[7098.10 --> 7098.64]  like hard.
[7098.86 --> 7101.66]  I don't think I really got it until I landed at BCIT.
[7101.66 --> 7102.66]  Um,
[7102.66 --> 7104.66]  because I would get really,
[7105.36 --> 7106.08]  um,
[7106.18 --> 7107.92]  like touchy,
[7107.98 --> 7108.76]  but my teachers,
[7108.76 --> 7114.08]  like I had a terrible grade in English for reasons that are probably self-explanatory at this point.
[7114.50 --> 7114.90]  Um,
[7115.28 --> 7116.78]  until I got an English teacher,
[7116.78 --> 7117.10]  blonde,
[7117.10 --> 7117.78]  uh,
[7117.78 --> 7122.96]  until I got an English teacher that was just an absolute badass,
[7123.20 --> 7123.50]  Mr.
[7123.58 --> 7123.90]  Thompson.
[7124.70 --> 7125.10]  Fantastic.
[7125.84 --> 7126.32]  Um,
[7127.04 --> 7130.56]  and then my English grade cranked and I got into AP English out of nowhere.
[7130.56 --> 7133.40]  I was like barely passing for my whole life.
[7133.40 --> 7136.66]  And then I got a high A and then AP English the next year.
[7136.66 --> 7139.40]  And then he was a professional writer for a while,
[7139.48 --> 7141.10]  which was a choice.
[7141.10 --> 7141.74]  Um,
[7141.90 --> 7142.48]  and then,
[7142.48 --> 7147.18]  and that was kind of similar for a lot of different things in school where like,
[7147.20 --> 7148.16]  if I had a good teacher,
[7148.16 --> 7150.46]  I would get like dialed in and do super well.
[7150.46 --> 7151.72]  But if I had a bad teacher,
[7151.76 --> 7153.46]  I had this like,
[7154.28 --> 7154.46]  well,
[7154.46 --> 7155.24]  I don't like that teacher.
[7155.32 --> 7155.98]  I'm not going to try,
[7156.16 --> 7156.46]  which is stupid.
[7157.74 --> 7158.02]  Um,
[7159.66 --> 7160.62]  Panda asks,
[7160.70 --> 7161.46]  made my brain happy.
[7161.56 --> 7161.96]  Hey Linus,
[7162.00 --> 7164.22]  have any of your kids displayed ADHD traits?
[7166.86 --> 7167.82]  What do you think?
[7171.10 --> 7172.28]  I mean,
[7172.28 --> 7173.00]  I don't know,
[7173.06 --> 7173.32]  man.
[7173.36 --> 7177.06]  It's one of those things where it's like neuro neurodivergence.
[7177.20 --> 7177.42]  Right.
[7177.80 --> 7183.00]  And I think that if you want to be at a certain level of excellence in certain things,
[7183.00 --> 7185.64]  you probably have to be on extremes somewhere.
[7186.26 --> 7190.36]  You're probably on some kind of spectrum of some sort.
[7191.02 --> 7191.34]  Sick.
[7191.72 --> 7192.14]  Um,
[7192.52 --> 7193.02]  and it's,
[7193.02 --> 7195.46]  and it's one of those things where like,
[7195.52 --> 7196.58]  I've,
[7196.58 --> 7196.78]  uh,
[7196.78 --> 7199.06]  I've had conversations with people where they're like,
[7199.48 --> 7199.80]  okay,
[7199.88 --> 7200.10]  yeah,
[7200.18 --> 7200.52]  Linus,
[7200.52 --> 7203.14]  but I don't feel bad for you because for you,
[7203.22 --> 7203.50]  you know,
[7203.50 --> 7206.00]  the hyper focus and sort of the inability to,
[7206.00 --> 7208.98]  to pay attention to one thing for a long time.
[7208.98 --> 7210.38]  And you kind of like are,
[7210.50 --> 7211.58]  you go off on these tangents.
[7211.58 --> 7212.46]  It's like a superpower.
[7213.28 --> 7213.60]  And,
[7213.60 --> 7214.38]  and,
[7214.48 --> 7214.58]  you know,
[7214.64 --> 7214.86]  for me,
[7214.88 --> 7215.60]  it's not like that.
[7215.62 --> 7215.96]  And it's like,
[7216.00 --> 7216.24]  yeah,
[7216.78 --> 7221.08]  but at some point you're going to have to decide if you want to make excuses or if you want to win.
[7222.46 --> 7223.34]  I was a,
[7223.44 --> 7224.44]  yeah,
[7225.12 --> 7227.40]  that was a lesson I got from my physics teacher.
[7227.68 --> 7228.00]  Really?
[7228.26 --> 7228.54]  Yeah.
[7228.54 --> 7233.00]  I won't name him because not a lot of people are stoked about this lesson,
[7233.08 --> 7234.16]  but it was interesting at the time,
[7234.16 --> 7234.94]  uh,
[7235.12 --> 7236.80]  where there was someone in class.
[7237.00 --> 7237.50]  There was someone in class.
[7237.56 --> 7238.02]  I have,
[7238.12 --> 7238.88]  I have certain,
[7239.06 --> 7239.32]  you know,
[7239.32 --> 7239.76]  I can't,
[7239.76 --> 7241.20]  I can't read all that great,
[7241.20 --> 7241.50]  but,
[7241.72 --> 7242.16]  um,
[7242.16 --> 7243.40]  someone in class had a,
[7243.50 --> 7244.92]  some form of,
[7244.92 --> 7245.32]  um,
[7246.80 --> 7247.46]  learning disability.
[7247.54 --> 7248.28]  I don't remember what it was.
[7248.68 --> 7249.10]  And,
[7249.46 --> 7250.00]  um,
[7250.00 --> 7251.54]  it was,
[7251.60 --> 7252.44]  it was constant,
[7252.52 --> 7252.64]  right?
[7252.68 --> 7253.72]  Every single class,
[7253.72 --> 7256.12]  when we broke it into doing work,
[7256.12 --> 7259.40]  this person requested help and the teacher would help them.
[7259.50 --> 7260.50]  Never a problem with that.
[7260.60 --> 7260.72]  Yeah.
[7260.86 --> 7261.66]  And then they,
[7261.76 --> 7262.52]  they asked for,
[7262.58 --> 7266.36]  I think they asked for something else.
[7266.58 --> 7270.74]  It was like a lower required grade to pass the class or something like that.
[7271.20 --> 7271.64]  Um,
[7272.00 --> 7275.16]  and he drew like an extremely hard line and he was like,
[7275.16 --> 7275.36]  no,
[7275.40 --> 7276.36]  because when you leave,
[7276.84 --> 7277.92]  this will never be a thing.
[7278.74 --> 7279.38]  So like,
[7279.44 --> 7280.82]  you got to figure it out now,
[7280.82 --> 7281.48]  but he's like,
[7281.52 --> 7284.28]  I'm here at all times to help.
[7284.46 --> 7284.82]  Yeah.
[7285.00 --> 7285.54]  But like,
[7285.62 --> 7285.96]  you know,
[7285.98 --> 7286.36]  I can,
[7286.62 --> 7287.92]  I can help you after class.
[7287.92 --> 7289.00]  I can help you on lunch.
[7289.00 --> 7291.44]  I can help you on various other breaks.
[7291.44 --> 7292.64]  If you take a spare period,
[7292.64 --> 7293.64]  I can help you during that.
[7293.64 --> 7294.42]  If I have time,
[7294.42 --> 7297.90]  I can potentially help you outside of class.
[7297.90 --> 7299.58]  Like I can give you everything,
[7299.58 --> 7301.66]  but you have to pass the same bar.
[7302.50 --> 7302.90]  Um,
[7302.90 --> 7306.04]  and overhearing that cause you could,
[7306.12 --> 7307.26]  they were like talking in the corner,
[7307.26 --> 7307.54]  right?
[7307.56 --> 7309.76]  But you could kind of still hear it overhearing that.
[7309.86 --> 7310.16]  I was like,
[7310.24 --> 7310.50]  huh?
[7310.88 --> 7311.20]  Okay.
[7311.72 --> 7314.64]  I need to kind of shut up about my reading thing and like,
[7314.76 --> 7315.36]  figure it out.
[7315.62 --> 7316.70]  And to be clear,
[7316.90 --> 7318.52]  shut up and figure it out.
[7318.52 --> 7319.60]  Isn't the right way either.
[7319.78 --> 7321.08]  Not always get support.
[7321.20 --> 7321.44]  Yeah.
[7321.48 --> 7322.30]  Talk to people,
[7322.44 --> 7322.94]  you know,
[7322.94 --> 7323.90]  get a diagnosis,
[7324.50 --> 7324.82]  you know,
[7324.90 --> 7326.04]  find resources.
[7326.40 --> 7326.88]  For me,
[7326.88 --> 7327.62]  it was the right thing.
[7327.62 --> 7328.34]  Oh yes.
[7328.54 --> 7329.36]  And that's fine.
[7329.68 --> 7330.52]  But your way,
[7330.64 --> 7332.12]  your path might be totally different.
[7332.26 --> 7332.44]  Very.
[7332.60 --> 7332.76]  Yeah.
[7332.90 --> 7335.68]  Your path is probably going to be very different.
[7336.02 --> 7337.70]  It might also inform like,
[7338.10 --> 7338.42]  you know,
[7339.06 --> 7341.02]  maybe you should do a slightly different thing.
[7341.98 --> 7342.28]  Yeah.
[7342.50 --> 7343.44]  I think the,
[7343.64 --> 7343.76]  our,
[7343.76 --> 7345.22]  our generation was hammered with the,
[7345.32 --> 7346.26]  like everyone can do anything.
[7346.52 --> 7347.54]  You can be anything.
[7347.66 --> 7347.86]  Yeah.
[7347.98 --> 7351.34]  Like literally we were told we could be astronauts.
[7351.52 --> 7351.80]  Yeah.
[7352.32 --> 7354.40]  I cannot be an astronaut.
[7354.76 --> 7354.98]  Yeah.
[7354.98 --> 7355.76]  If I had,
[7355.86 --> 7358.22]  if I had focused every,
[7358.38 --> 7362.26]  every ounce of my being on being an astronaut,
[7362.26 --> 7363.58]  from the age of two,
[7364.08 --> 7366.92]  I would be no closer to space than I am right now.
[7366.92 --> 7368.50]  And that is exactly five feet,
[7368.62 --> 7370.16]  six inches off of the earth.
[7371.64 --> 7372.00]  Five,
[7372.08 --> 7372.26]  nine.
[7372.36 --> 7372.88]  If I jump.
[7373.18 --> 7373.44]  Yeah.
[7374.08 --> 7374.90]  And I think,
[7374.98 --> 7375.24]  honestly,
[7375.32 --> 7376.54]  I think that advice was,
[7376.62 --> 7377.66]  was kind of poisonous.
[7377.66 --> 7378.46]  Um,
[7378.90 --> 7379.12]  yeah,
[7379.14 --> 7379.70]  I think so too.
[7380.48 --> 7380.86]  And I,
[7380.86 --> 7382.80]  I think sometimes recognizing like,
[7382.90 --> 7383.20]  okay,
[7383.78 --> 7384.32]  um,
[7385.08 --> 7386.74]  I am,
[7386.82 --> 7388.78]  I am clearly not good at this thing,
[7388.80 --> 7389.70]  even if I like it.
[7389.76 --> 7389.94]  Well,
[7390.06 --> 7393.06]  there's practically infinite other possibilities in the world.
[7393.20 --> 7396.18]  Maybe I should find something else that I like and I can do well.
[7396.28 --> 7398.04]  That was something that I really struggled with.
[7398.04 --> 7398.74]  There's so many options.
[7398.74 --> 7400.38]  We weren't exposed to that much.
[7400.46 --> 7401.46]  At least I wasn't.
[7401.54 --> 7401.72]  Yeah.
[7401.84 --> 7402.50]  It was like,
[7402.56 --> 7403.80]  do you want to be a tradesperson,
[7403.90 --> 7404.28]  a policeman,
[7404.38 --> 7404.98]  a firefighter,
[7404.98 --> 7405.48]  an astronaut?
[7405.48 --> 7405.92]  Or a teacher.
[7405.92 --> 7406.72]  Don't forget teacher.
[7407.00 --> 7407.14]  Yeah.
[7407.50 --> 7407.74]  Yeah.
[7407.92 --> 7408.38]  And like,
[7408.66 --> 7410.96]  so I just thought I wanted to be a teacher because I was like,
[7410.98 --> 7411.32]  I don't know.
[7411.36 --> 7412.10]  My mom's a teacher.
[7412.24 --> 7413.12]  There's like five options.
[7413.32 --> 7413.88]  Stepdad's a teacher.
[7413.96 --> 7414.74]  My aunt's a teacher.
[7414.90 --> 7415.04]  Yeah.
[7415.12 --> 7416.76]  Every adult in my life.
[7416.80 --> 7418.00]  Like I just listed all the things.
[7418.00 --> 7418.98]  My teachers are all teachers.
[7419.24 --> 7422.48]  I didn't know what people went to business school for until I was in like high school.
[7423.98 --> 7424.50]  I was like,
[7424.52 --> 7425.02]  what do you mean?
[7425.64 --> 7426.90]  You just do like these things.
[7427.24 --> 7427.46]  Yeah.
[7427.54 --> 7429.38]  Cause it's all anyone would ever tell you.
[7429.54 --> 7431.52]  You just have a boss and you just do what they tell you.
[7431.58 --> 7431.84]  Yeah.
[7431.96 --> 7432.20]  Yeah.
[7432.20 --> 7432.90]  Like I know.
[7433.42 --> 7433.78]  Oh,
[7434.08 --> 7434.44]  okay.
[7434.82 --> 7435.02]  Yeah.
[7435.02 --> 7435.20]  You know,
[7435.22 --> 7436.02]  you figured out eventually,
[7436.02 --> 7436.96]  but it was,
[7437.06 --> 7441.04]  it was a weird time in regards to communication of what like schools and teachers were telling
[7441.04 --> 7441.20]  you,
[7441.20 --> 7441.46]  you could,
[7441.64 --> 7443.20]  you could do when you grew up.
[7444.20 --> 7444.82]  Dwindland says,
[7444.90 --> 7446.82]  I still don't know what people go to business school for.
[7447.08 --> 7449.06]  I think it's for a common sense education.
[7449.06 --> 7449.50]  Honestly,
[7449.50 --> 7455.02]  a lot of what people seem to cover there is just like how to interact with people,
[7455.02 --> 7455.92]  how to,
[7455.92 --> 7458.18]  how to do basic analysis,
[7458.18 --> 7459.88]  how to generate a,
[7459.88 --> 7460.60]  that's pretty valuable.
[7461.10 --> 7461.54]  Communication.
[7461.92 --> 7462.10]  I know,
[7462.18 --> 7462.46]  I know.
[7463.14 --> 7464.64]  How to generate a report.
[7464.88 --> 7465.10]  Dude,
[7465.10 --> 7466.18]  it's such a huge problem.
[7466.30 --> 7467.60]  How to do a meeting.
[7468.18 --> 7469.06]  How to sell.
[7469.76 --> 7471.12]  It all comes back to how to sell.
[7471.12 --> 7473.58]  You were talking earlier in the show about how you have to be selling all the time.
[7473.70 --> 7473.94]  These are,
[7474.00 --> 7475.86]  these are genuinely very valuable things.
[7475.86 --> 7477.02]  Always be closing.
[7477.80 --> 7478.16]  Yeah.
[7481.00 --> 7481.44]  Um,
[7482.22 --> 7484.32]  yeah.
[7485.38 --> 7485.78]  Conversely,
[7485.80 --> 7487.40]  if you find a way to do,
[7488.54 --> 7490.04]  find a way to love what,
[7490.10 --> 7490.94]  see reading problems,
[7491.14 --> 7494.48]  you find a way to love what does work surrounding yourself with others.
[7494.68 --> 7495.08]  Okay.
[7495.08 --> 7495.92]  I can't read that properly,
[7495.92 --> 7496.58]  but yeah,
[7496.58 --> 7496.84]  I mean,
[7496.84 --> 7497.06]  there's,
[7497.12 --> 7498.18]  there's alternatives to everything,
[7498.18 --> 7498.40]  right?
[7498.40 --> 7498.92]  Like there's,
[7499.04 --> 7499.28]  um,
[7499.28 --> 7500.88]  um,
[7500.88 --> 7502.08]  there's a guy who,
[7502.18 --> 7504.52]  who doesn't have any arms and is a,
[7504.62 --> 7505.26]  uh,
[7505.26 --> 7507.12]  a race car drifting person.
[7507.32 --> 7511.14]  I think he does literally formula drift and he doesn't have arms.
[7511.30 --> 7515.74]  He steers the wheel with one of his legs and then he manages all the pedals of his other,
[7515.84 --> 7516.86]  like amazing,
[7517.30 --> 7518.04]  super sick,
[7518.28 --> 7518.78]  made it work.
[7518.92 --> 7520.02]  There's routes for sure.
[7520.14 --> 7520.62]  I saw this.
[7520.86 --> 7524.20]  You also have to understand that was way harder for him than anybody else.
[7524.20 --> 7525.96]  And there was no,
[7525.96 --> 7526.34]  like,
[7526.54 --> 7528.80]  I saw this incredible video of a mom,
[7528.80 --> 7529.38]  uh,
[7529.38 --> 7533.30]  with no arms lifting her baby onto,
[7533.60 --> 7537.18]  into a seat and then like out of it and stuff with her legs.
[7537.52 --> 7538.40]  That's so sick.
[7538.46 --> 7538.94]  Just like from,
[7539.06 --> 7539.48]  like from a,
[7539.56 --> 7540.42]  from a chair position,
[7540.42 --> 7544.68]  like being an absolute badass super mom without arms.
[7544.68 --> 7545.08]  But like,
[7545.50 --> 7545.76]  yeah,
[7546.30 --> 7546.58]  yeah.
[7547.88 --> 7548.44]  And like,
[7548.46 --> 7548.60]  it,
[7548.60 --> 7551.02]  it sucks that that's harder for her for sure.
[7551.14 --> 7555.70]  But I think wallowing in self pity over it isn't going to help.
[7557.40 --> 7558.08]  Might help.
[7558.74 --> 7559.14]  No.
[7559.94 --> 7560.42]  Might help.
[7560.62 --> 7561.30]  I don't think so.
[7561.54 --> 7561.80]  It could.
[7562.80 --> 7563.92]  You won't know unless you try.
[7564.04 --> 7564.26]  Go ahead.
[7564.30 --> 7564.44]  Try.
[7567.32 --> 7567.86]  Let's see.
[7567.98 --> 7568.66]  Let's see if it helps.
[7568.74 --> 7569.00]  Go ahead.
[7569.00 --> 7569.06]  Okay.
[7569.06 --> 7569.12]  Okay.
[7569.12 --> 7569.16]  Okay.
[7569.16 --> 7569.20]  Okay.
[7569.20 --> 7569.64]  Okay.
[7569.64 --> 7569.70]  Okay.
[7569.70 --> 7569.76]  Okay.
[7569.76 --> 7570.12]  Okay.
[7570.12 --> 7571.06]  Okay.
[7571.06 --> 7571.12]  Okay.
[7571.12 --> 7571.18]  Okay.
[7571.18 --> 7571.72]  Okay.
[7571.72 --> 7571.74]  Okay.
[7571.74 --> 7572.20]  Okay.
[7572.20 --> 7573.14]  Okay.
[7573.14 --> 7573.20]  Okay.
[7573.20 --> 7573.66]  Okay.
[7573.66 --> 7585.84]  Okay.
[7585.84 --> 7587.26]  All right.
[7588.38 --> 7589.70]  What are we doing?
[7590.80 --> 7596.62]  I just want to make it clear that everything that Luke and I say comes with a little bit of survivorship bias as well.
[7596.86 --> 7602.16]  Obviously we have powered through and succeeded in our respective fields.
[7602.16 --> 7607.20]  And so, you know, it's easy for us to say, hey, this, this worked, this works great.
[7607.74 --> 7615.54]  But, but I think the most important thing I said was the part where I said, learn about yourself, find yourself, know yourself.
[7615.84 --> 7615.96]  Yeah.
[7615.96 --> 7621.20]  And then, you know, seek out a diagnosis, seek out strategies, seek out support, find your own path.
[7621.20 --> 7627.16]  If what, if the path that you're on isn't working, understand that you can almost certainly find another path.
[7627.22 --> 7629.20]  I think that's the biggest thing for me.
[7629.20 --> 7634.02]  It's like, there's, there's things that I wanted to do when I was growing up that I was able to self-recognize.
[7634.02 --> 7636.30]  Like this just isn't a good route for me.
[7636.48 --> 7638.70]  And there's ways to win that are not being an astronaut.
[7639.18 --> 7639.34]  Yeah.
[7639.34 --> 7639.98]  And that's okay.
[7640.08 --> 7641.48]  You don't have to win that hard.
[7641.48 --> 7651.22]  Dude, the, the need for, oh man, if you get into, as far as I can tell, literally any trade in BC, you will just kill it.
[7651.28 --> 7651.60]  Oh yeah.
[7652.26 --> 7653.24]  My goodness.
[7653.26 --> 7654.06]  Actually crush it.
[7654.06 --> 7654.32]  You will destroy.
[7654.70 --> 7656.72]  Like it's, it's, yeah.
[7656.78 --> 7664.08]  And not all of them are like excruciating pain and like, yeah, like requiring a ton of strength.
[7664.34 --> 7664.42]  Like.
[7664.48 --> 7669.50]  There's a lot of tools that are coming out that are, that can help assist with that type of stuff in really cool ways.
[7669.50 --> 7673.54]  Like if you don't even, if you don't like getting dirty, being an electrician, you know, if you.
[7674.14 --> 7675.52]  Well, some of them still get dirty.
[7675.52 --> 7675.76]  Okay.
[7675.76 --> 7680.70]  Some of them still get dirty, but there's definitely a lot of jobs where you don't get as dirty.
[7680.86 --> 7685.42]  Like you don't, you don't have to do, you know, residential, you know, plumbing repair.
[7685.86 --> 7686.70]  You know, like there's.
[7687.04 --> 7687.40]  Yeah.
[7687.50 --> 7688.62]  There's lots of trades.
[7689.06 --> 7689.26]  Yeah.
[7689.26 --> 7690.70]  Is the point that I'm trying to make here.
[7690.88 --> 7691.12]  There's tons.
[7694.68 --> 7695.14]  Hold on.
[7695.18 --> 7696.72]  There was something here that I thought was really funny.
[7696.94 --> 7697.70]  Stay the path says.
[7697.78 --> 7697.90]  Whoa.
[7697.90 --> 7699.48]  I can't help but feel like they're talking directly.
[7699.50 --> 7700.40]  directly to me.
[7701.82 --> 7702.18]  Sorry.
[7702.68 --> 7702.92]  1987.
[7703.22 --> 7705.82]  Dadson in full plane chat said, I'm a lineman in the States.
[7706.00 --> 7707.72]  I make over 200 K a year.
[7707.88 --> 7710.08]  The trades of the way I didn't even go to college.
[7711.54 --> 7712.18]  200 K a year.
[7712.30 --> 7713.00]  You ass.
[7713.38 --> 7713.60]  Yeah.
[7713.64 --> 7714.58]  That's like real money.
[7716.78 --> 7717.22]  Yeah.
[7717.76 --> 7718.00]  Yeah.
[7718.00 --> 7718.96]  Like I, I don't know.
[7719.08 --> 7719.82]  There's, there's routes.
[7720.08 --> 7720.60]  There's routes.
[7720.74 --> 7724.06]  A lot of like people, people troll garbage men all the time, dude.
[7724.20 --> 7725.56]  They make cash.
[7725.88 --> 7726.32]  Yeah.
[7726.44 --> 7728.18]  And a lot of, a lot of the garbage routes.
[7728.34 --> 7729.28]  This was, this was.
[7729.28 --> 7730.78]  I think you mean sanitation professional.
[7730.92 --> 7731.12]  Sure.
[7731.22 --> 7731.38]  Whatever.
[7731.58 --> 7736.64]  Uh, a lot of the sanitation professional routes, as far as I've heard are based on completion,
[7736.64 --> 7737.88]  not time.
[7738.56 --> 7741.02]  So you'll notice how they, they often work really fast.
[7741.36 --> 7741.80]  Oh yeah.
[7741.94 --> 7742.98]  They get paid the same.
[7743.28 --> 7743.52]  Right.
[7743.62 --> 7747.40]  So you get a team of people, people that are going to hustle and they finish this eight
[7747.40 --> 7749.20]  hour route in like five and a half.
[7749.84 --> 7752.58]  Then you just have the whole rest of the day off and you didn't lose any income.
[7752.94 --> 7754.20]  Kind of a sick job.
[7755.22 --> 7756.68]  Like cool.
[7757.04 --> 7761.30]  And then if you're a hustler, go start a side hustle in that extra two and a half hours
[7761.30 --> 7761.58]  every day.
[7761.58 --> 7763.58]  And then you're just making major bank.
[7763.58 --> 7764.90]  Like, I don't know.
[7764.98 --> 7768.38]  There's, there's a lot of really cool options, like legitimately really cool options.
[7768.84 --> 7775.34]  Especially I find if you look at jobs that are like less traditionally attractive because
[7775.34 --> 7777.18]  then there usually isn't as much competition.
[7777.42 --> 7782.64]  And when there isn't as much competition, it's often, um, you know, you end up making more
[7782.64 --> 7783.14]  money for it.
[7783.70 --> 7784.80]  So, yeah.
[7784.80 --> 7790.96]  Um, speaking of making money, the show was brought to you by Supermicro.
[7791.32 --> 7792.48]  Look up in the sky.
[7792.72 --> 7793.42]  It's a bird.
[7793.50 --> 7794.04]  It's a plane.
[7794.14 --> 7796.20]  It's Supermicro.
[7796.30 --> 7796.98]  Oh my God.
[7797.50 --> 7798.16]  That's right.
[7798.36 --> 7804.14]  Supermicro is taking things to the next level with their H14 generation servers powered by
[7804.14 --> 7813.06]  AMD's Epic 9005 processors with a staggering 192 cores and 384 threads bird chip and powered
[7813.06 --> 7816.08]  by Radeon Instinct MI325X GPUs.
[7816.12 --> 7819.60]  These servers are designed to provide maximum performance and efficiency.
[7820.56 --> 7822.44]  That was an up to 192 cores, by the way.
[7822.90 --> 7826.62]  And Supermicro's building block architecture allows for customization of expansion, acceleration,
[7826.84 --> 7831.02]  networking, and storage supporting AMD Zen 4 and Zen 5 processors.
[7831.60 --> 7836.18]  Supermicro also has industry leading time to deployment taking just weeks from design
[7836.18 --> 7838.44]  to validation and delivery rather than months.
[7838.90 --> 7843.02]  We actually visited their headquarters recently and did a series of videos on all things H14
[7843.06 --> 7844.88]  which you can check out on their channel.
[7845.30 --> 7847.64]  No heat vision or super speed required.
[7848.18 --> 7853.82]  Visit the link in the description for more information on Supermicro's H14 servers today.
[7854.12 --> 7857.24]  The show is also brought to you by MSI.
[7857.30 --> 7858.10]  Oh my God.
[7858.54 --> 7866.04]  They say diamonds are a girl's best friend, but MSI's MegCore LiquidEye 360 can be a gamer
[7866.04 --> 7867.96]  girl's best friend.
[7867.96 --> 7873.58]  With a design inspired by the angular cuts of diamonds, the 360 liquid cooler is sure
[7873.58 --> 7875.68]  to catch an eye or two in those fancy builds.
[7876.20 --> 7880.56]  Their dual-sided infinity mirror design further highlights the diamond theme and then blings
[7880.56 --> 7883.08]  it the heck out with that sweet, sweet RGB.
[7884.74 --> 7888.10]  And to keep things neat and tidy, it comes with covers for its pre-installed fan cables,
[7888.20 --> 7889.36]  creating a cleaner setup.
[7889.36 --> 7895.64]  If super whirling jet engines are not your thing, no worries because their LDB technology
[7895.64 --> 7900.44]  in the fans is there to lower noise levels, improve heat dissipation, and extend the lifespan
[7900.44 --> 7901.34]  of the cooler.
[7902.50 --> 7905.74]  All the goodies you need are included right there in the box like thermal paste, mounting
[7905.74 --> 7910.34]  screws, cables, and even an integrated uni installation bracket for both Intel and AMD sockets.
[7910.54 --> 7915.24]  So go check out the MSI MegCore LiquidEye 360 cooler using our link in the video description.
[7915.24 --> 7917.56]  Finally, the show is brought to you by Ridge.
[7917.88 --> 7922.96]  If you missed the reveal a few WAN shows back, our collab with Ridge is now available for you
[7922.96 --> 7927.30]  to pick up with a circuit board design thanks to our very own Cerabut.
[7927.56 --> 7933.58]  We hope it catches as many eyes for you as I dropped it when filming this spot.
[7933.68 --> 7935.00]  Catches as many eyes for you.
[7935.04 --> 7936.48]  I don't know, Dennis probably liked this.
[7937.08 --> 7937.98]  And it's a wallet.
[7938.40 --> 7941.96]  So besides being impossible to take your eyes off of, it's functional.
[7942.26 --> 7942.90]  Here's some features.
[7942.90 --> 7947.28]  It holds 112 cards, it's RFID blocking, it includes an extra set of silver screws, and
[7947.28 --> 7949.42]  it comes with a cash strap and money clip.
[7949.64 --> 7950.58]  Plus, it's a Ridge product.
[7950.72 --> 7952.06]  So, you know, the quality is top notch.
[7952.12 --> 7954.24]  I mean, we've been partnered with them for over five years.
[7954.30 --> 7954.98]  Is that really true?
[7955.26 --> 7957.28]  That sounds true, actually.
[7960.18 --> 7961.00]  Still not sure?
[7961.32 --> 7966.34]  Well, they have a limited lifetime warranty and a 99-day free trial, which means there's
[7966.34 --> 7967.64]  really no reason not to try it out.
[7967.64 --> 7971.92]  So go to ridge.com slash circuit board or click the link in the video description to
[7971.92 --> 7973.04]  pick one up today.
[7974.58 --> 7975.16]  All right.
[7975.26 --> 7976.50]  Dan, what are we supposed to be doing now?
[7976.86 --> 7980.96]  I want to show something really quick before we move on.
[7981.28 --> 7986.10]  We were talking about, you know, being able to do different things and technology moving
[7986.10 --> 7988.12]  forward and allowing you to do maybe some more things.
[7988.38 --> 7989.08]  But blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[7989.30 --> 7990.20]  Have you seen this?
[7990.20 --> 7994.40]  Japanese cafe employs paralyzed people to control robots.
[7994.58 --> 7995.22]  That's just so cool.
[7995.50 --> 7996.28]  So sick.
[7996.46 --> 7997.42]  That is so cool.
[7997.54 --> 7998.22]  So sick.
[8000.14 --> 8000.96]  That is so cool.
[8001.02 --> 8003.70]  The staff is robots, but they are controlled by people.
[8005.60 --> 8006.66]  Actually so cool.
[8007.54 --> 8009.22]  I love stuff like this.
[8011.38 --> 8011.82]  Huh.
[8014.82 --> 8019.30]  They're avatars for people with diseases and illnesses, such as ALS, to connect with people
[8019.30 --> 8020.94]  while they're stuck bedridden.
[8021.26 --> 8022.86]  It's a fantastic concept.
[8023.04 --> 8023.92]  Add it to your itinerary.
[8024.84 --> 8026.84]  Dude, my sister-in-law just got back from Japan.
[8026.96 --> 8028.54]  I would have totally told her to go check that out.
[8028.78 --> 8029.30]  Super cool.
[8029.90 --> 8031.00]  Absolutely love this idea.
[8035.32 --> 8036.06]  No, Ducati.
[8036.16 --> 8038.36]  There are no plans for an ad-supported floatplane tier.
[8038.36 --> 8041.20]  We'd have to build an entire new ad sales department.
[8042.10 --> 8044.00]  And no.
[8044.96 --> 8049.06]  Lee School said, as a disabled person, I find this more dystopian than cool.
[8049.26 --> 8049.52]  Really?
[8049.84 --> 8050.04]  Oh.
[8051.28 --> 8051.56]  Wow.
[8053.34 --> 8053.58]  Hmm.
[8053.80 --> 8054.12]  Okay.
[8054.90 --> 8055.06]  I've seen a lot of positive feedback.
[8055.06 --> 8058.72]  In this case, it's specifically called out diseased people, though.
[8058.96 --> 8060.06]  Not necessarily...
[8062.62 --> 8062.86]  Hmm.
[8064.30 --> 8065.40]  Well, okay.
[8067.02 --> 8067.80]  Duly noted.
[8069.80 --> 8070.24]  Hmm.
[8072.98 --> 8074.12]  The WordPress...
[8074.12 --> 8074.42]  Oh, wait.
[8074.48 --> 8075.36]  We're supposed to do merge messages.
[8075.54 --> 8075.78]  All right.
[8075.84 --> 8076.16]  Hit us.
[8076.34 --> 8076.50]  Sure.
[8076.50 --> 8077.88]  Message for Luke.
[8078.24 --> 8079.54]  Fellow listexic here.
[8080.94 --> 8083.96]  Have you ever read or heard of the dyslexic advantage?
[8085.58 --> 8085.98]  No.
[8086.28 --> 8088.20]  What would be a dyslexic advantage?
[8088.42 --> 8090.12]  You also missed part of this merch message.
[8090.80 --> 8092.50]  I thought you'd have a Google of that.
[8093.16 --> 8094.90]  LMG crew, keep up the good work.
[8095.10 --> 8097.04]  And who the F is this Dan guy?
[8099.66 --> 8100.06]  Interesting.
[8100.24 --> 8102.18]  I ain't gonna prompt you at this week, Linus.
[8102.18 --> 8105.08]  That was very embarrassing.
[8105.24 --> 8105.92]  I'm sorry about that.
[8108.72 --> 8110.64]  The dyslexic advantage is a thing.
[8110.82 --> 8114.50]  I have to say, this being a book has got to be the most hilarious thing.
[8115.74 --> 8117.04]  I'm sure you've seen the font.
[8117.22 --> 8120.72]  It's got to be the funniest thing I've, like, ever heard.
[8120.72 --> 8126.54]  That's like somebody writing an ADHD book that's 12,000 pages.
[8126.68 --> 8127.84]  Yeah, something like that.
[8128.84 --> 8130.10]  I would be...
[8130.10 --> 8132.74]  It would be interesting if it was in one of those fonts that's easier to read.
[8133.46 --> 8134.86]  But no, I haven't heard of this.
[8135.04 --> 8135.44]  I don't know.
[8136.02 --> 8137.08]  Just get an audio book.
[8137.90 --> 8138.14]  Yeah.
[8141.28 --> 8143.24]  Reviews are really positive, it seems.
[8144.06 --> 8145.08]  Wish I read it sooner.
[8145.08 --> 8146.08]  Interesting.
[8147.36 --> 8150.04]  Yeah, I have no idea what it's supposed to be.
[8150.32 --> 8152.96]  I mean, have you found an advantage on your own?
[8153.22 --> 8153.36]  No.
[8153.66 --> 8155.20]  Okay, then I guess you need this book.
[8155.44 --> 8158.42]  Unless I'm, like, already doing it and don't realize it or something.
[8158.64 --> 8158.96]  I don't know.
[8158.96 --> 8159.00]  Yeah.
[8159.18 --> 8160.58]  But it just makes reading harder.
[8160.82 --> 8163.80]  Maybe it makes cooking chicken easier.
[8163.96 --> 8164.20]  Yeah.
[8165.40 --> 8165.80]  Expert.
[8166.10 --> 8166.38]  Maybe.
[8166.88 --> 8167.28]  Maybe.
[8167.28 --> 8167.40]  Maybe.
[8167.72 --> 8168.18]  You don't know.
[8172.16 --> 8173.06]  Up next.
[8173.06 --> 8179.02]  Why does Linus focus on the bill of materials cost when arguing a product isn't overpriced?
[8179.14 --> 8183.16]  If bomb costs exceed the value to consumers, then the product needn't exist.
[8183.58 --> 8186.64]  Sales data seems like a better indicator of value.
[8187.72 --> 8188.08]  Okay.
[8189.40 --> 8190.06]  So...
[8192.18 --> 8197.70]  Overpriced, to me, is not a measure of value.
[8198.26 --> 8200.30]  It's a measure of the price.
[8200.30 --> 8203.40]  And the price is the price.
[8203.50 --> 8205.64]  The price of, um...
[8205.64 --> 8209.40]  Let's say, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
[8209.40 --> 8210.06]  Man.
[8210.90 --> 8213.54]  Oh, this is a tough one.
[8216.18 --> 8217.58]  Value is subjective.
[8218.80 --> 8221.40]  Cost and price is not.
[8221.54 --> 8222.88]  They are objective.
[8222.88 --> 8232.48]  So, if something has a bill of materials cost of $100 and a retail price of $150 or $200,
[8232.98 --> 8241.22]  it is objectively priced within the range of what you would expect based on, um, how...
[8241.22 --> 8249.12]  What a brand would have to price it at in order to account for all of the various other expenses that they need to manage within their business.
[8249.12 --> 8255.76]  All of their administrative overhead, customer service, breakage and warranty, and, like, after-sales support.
[8255.96 --> 8258.02]  All of that overhead that they have to cover.
[8258.02 --> 8264.92]  You can typically expect a markup on a product to be anywhere from, like, 50 to 100 points, bare minimum.
[8265.32 --> 8267.90]  Luxury brands get away with a lot more than that.
[8268.28 --> 8272.28]  But that's sort of pretty, pretty normal.
[8272.74 --> 8273.22]  Um, and...
[8273.22 --> 8276.32]  And it can even be normal to go quite a bit higher.
[8276.48 --> 8280.80]  Like, software companies, for example, will have margins way higher than that.
[8281.40 --> 8283.42]  So, if you were...
[8283.42 --> 8283.80]  Glasses.
[8284.04 --> 8284.74]  Yeah, glasses.
[8284.92 --> 8286.32]  Glasses have a lot of margin.
[8286.32 --> 8286.98]  Glasses will...
[8286.98 --> 8288.38]  Pharmaceuticals, a lot of margin.
[8288.66 --> 8292.50]  But the thing about pharmaceutical margin, and I'm not going to defend the big pharma companies,
[8292.50 --> 8296.76]  but the thing about pharmaceutical margin is there is a lot of R&D that goes in up front,
[8296.92 --> 8300.42]  and there is a need to cash in on that.
[8300.72 --> 8301.70]  Have they gone a little far?
[8302.42 --> 8302.82]  Absolutely.
[8303.18 --> 8305.82]  Like I said, you'll never hear me defend big pharma.
[8305.90 --> 8307.10]  Yeah, there's a lot of R&D in a lot of things.
[8308.42 --> 8311.06]  But there can be, especially in the past.
[8311.10 --> 8312.32]  I'd say it's less true now.
[8312.76 --> 8313.90]  Especially in the past.
[8313.90 --> 8318.88]  You could work for years trying to develop a drug, spend millions and millions and millions of dollars,
[8319.04 --> 8320.38]  and develop nothing.
[8320.50 --> 8324.70]  Like, it was a strike it rich or die trying industry.
[8325.00 --> 8328.20]  I think that with a lot of the new tools they have for drug development these days,
[8328.32 --> 8330.42]  it's less like that.
[8331.04 --> 8333.74]  But there was a time when it was like that anyway.
[8333.74 --> 8341.26]  So the cost of something and the price of something is just, it's objective, it's measurable.
[8342.86 --> 8345.94]  The value of something is subjective.
[8346.88 --> 8353.12]  And so when you say sales data seems like a better indicator of value, I would agree with that.
[8353.12 --> 8358.16]  I would agree that if something sells really well, then it's a good value.
[8358.36 --> 8363.82]  And if something doesn't sell very well, then it either was a bad value or there was bad marketing.
[8363.94 --> 8366.78]  There could be a variety of reasons that something doesn't sell very well.
[8367.06 --> 8370.48]  Actually, there can be a variety of reasons that something sells really well, including great marketing,
[8370.64 --> 8372.24]  and it not necessarily being a great value.
[8372.32 --> 8377.34]  But yes, I would agree with you that sales data is probably a better indicator of value.
[8377.34 --> 8380.50]  But value is up to you.
[8380.96 --> 8381.18]  Yeah.
[8381.26 --> 8382.02]  Or it's up to you.
[8382.34 --> 8382.54]  Yeah.
[8382.60 --> 8383.38]  Or it's up to me.
[8383.50 --> 8383.66]  No.
[8384.46 --> 8384.74]  What?
[8385.08 --> 8385.30]  No.
[8385.36 --> 8386.58]  Well, for me to make a purchase.
[8386.68 --> 8386.82]  No.
[8387.06 --> 8387.58]  Them and me.
[8388.22 --> 8388.46]  Okay.
[8388.54 --> 8388.98]  That's it.
[8389.20 --> 8389.38]  Yep.
[8390.32 --> 8391.44]  Value is personal.
[8391.96 --> 8401.04]  And so if I were to say this water bottle, I'm going to price it at $29.99.
[8401.52 --> 8402.84]  My cost is $15.
[8403.48 --> 8407.52]  You can say that's overpriced.
[8407.88 --> 8411.54]  And I can say you're wrong because it isn't.
[8411.66 --> 8412.68]  That's just what it costs.
[8412.72 --> 8414.16]  And you might not want one of these.
[8414.24 --> 8416.78]  You might not think that the insulated wall matters.
[8416.78 --> 8423.50]  You might like to drink out of a mason jar, which you can just get with the preserves that
[8423.50 --> 8426.64]  you would normally buy, and you can just repurpose it.
[8426.70 --> 8427.34]  And that's great.
[8427.42 --> 8429.80]  That costs you nothing, and that's a better value for sure.
[8429.90 --> 8430.20]  Sick.
[8430.20 --> 8432.20]  But this isn't overpriced.
[8432.92 --> 8435.38]  It's just not something that has a value to you.
[8435.44 --> 8437.46]  So value is subjective, and price is objective.
[8437.62 --> 8438.80]  And that's the difference.
[8438.90 --> 8440.08]  That took an awful long time.
[8440.64 --> 8441.02]  Carry on.
[8443.24 --> 8443.76]  Sure.
[8443.76 --> 8450.80]  I'm at my wedding's welcome party, and we're getting married tomorrow.
[8451.50 --> 8456.72]  Any advice for the newlyweds on the day of and for a happy life together onwards?
[8458.18 --> 8458.64]  Have fun.
[8459.18 --> 8459.66]  Don't.
[8461.26 --> 8461.82]  What?
[8462.06 --> 8462.94]  Don't have fun.
[8462.94 --> 8464.92]  That's all I meant.
[8465.66 --> 8466.54]  Don't get married.
[8466.74 --> 8471.72]  It's always so cringy when you see those, like, gifs or whatever of, like, somebody pushing
[8471.72 --> 8475.62]  their partner's face into the cake or something like that, and then it ruins the whole thing.
[8475.62 --> 8479.98]  Just don't do that.
[8481.68 --> 8487.34]  Don't, like, push your partner into doing something during the day that they're going to regret
[8487.34 --> 8488.42]  or might ruin their day.
[8488.48 --> 8494.32]  I'm assuming, based on, you know, demographics of our viewership, that this is a dude.
[8494.32 --> 8501.88]  Um, if your partner is a woman, there's a higher chance that they care about their appearance
[8501.88 --> 8502.36]  and stuff.
[8503.26 --> 8505.62]  So, you know, be careful.
[8505.82 --> 8509.66]  Don't, don't shove cake in their face, even if you've seen it on a meme and it looked funny
[8509.66 --> 8510.42]  and they enjoyed it.
[8510.74 --> 8511.94]  Uh, don't risk it.
[8512.54 --> 8513.38]  Ask first.
[8514.20 --> 8515.24]  Do stuff like that.
[8515.54 --> 8516.66]  Luke, consent tips.
[8516.76 --> 8517.18]  Be careful.
[8517.18 --> 8525.28]  It's just a lot of people put a ton of value into this day, right?
[8525.70 --> 8530.44]  So, just, you know, chill and be careful.
[8530.66 --> 8532.68]  Don't ruin it for your partner who might care a lot.
[8537.96 --> 8538.32]  Next.
[8539.02 --> 8540.28]  Ah, two to three more topics.
[8540.34 --> 8541.08]  What do you want to talk about?
[8541.84 --> 8543.18]  How about the WordPress feud?
[8545.04 --> 8545.40]  Yeah.
[8545.40 --> 8548.06]  Okay, I'm going to do the background here.
[8548.92 --> 8554.62]  WordPress.org is an open source web publishing project, which powers around 40% of the top
[8554.62 --> 8555.58]  10 million websites.
[8556.94 --> 8557.72]  We assume.
[8558.68 --> 8565.22]  It is owned by Matt Mullenweg, who is also the CEO of Automatic, which owns WordPress.com,
[8565.76 --> 8570.38]  a freemium web building platform based on WordPress.org.
[8571.42 --> 8572.16]  All right.
[8572.16 --> 8579.04]  A month ago, Automatic sent a cease and desist letter to WP Engine, a third-party WordPress
[8579.04 --> 8583.78]  hosting service, for using the WordPress trademark on their site because, according to Automatic,
[8584.34 --> 8589.92]  WordPress, excuse me, WP Engine doesn't contribute enough to the open source project.
[8590.80 --> 8596.28]  WP Engine sent their own cease and desist letter and claimed that Mullenweg told them he'd take
[8596.28 --> 8602.22]  a scorched-earth nuclear approach unless they paid 8% of their revenue as a trademark fee
[8602.22 --> 8606.50]  or dedicated an equivalent amount of employee time to the project.
[8607.50 --> 8614.10]  Mullenweg has since banned WP Engine from using WordPress.org's servers, which has broken WP Engine
[8614.10 --> 8615.12]  customers' websites.
[8615.12 --> 8619.24]  Last week, WP Engine sued WordPress for extortion.
[8619.84 --> 8625.92]  Further, 159 automatic employees who disagreed with Mullenweg's leadership accepted a severance
[8625.92 --> 8631.54]  package and left the company, which this isn't in our notes, but he apparently took to mean
[8631.54 --> 8637.18]  that everyone who remained agreed with him, which is not how that works.
[8637.18 --> 8638.18]  Yeah.
[8646.78 --> 8652.36]  Discussion question is, as much as it's good for people to contribute to open source projects,
[8652.60 --> 8656.20]  how are people supposed to trust open source projects when the rug can get pulled out from
[8656.20 --> 8657.82]  under them at a moment's notice?
[8658.62 --> 8660.40]  That's true for closed source projects, too.
[8660.48 --> 8662.18]  That's just part of life.
[8665.58 --> 8666.26]  I don't know.
[8666.26 --> 8667.02]  Yeah, it sucks.
[8668.62 --> 8675.30]  That being said, of like all the times in the internet's history, this is the easiest
[8675.30 --> 8676.74]  one to pivot off.
[8677.84 --> 8684.74]  So as much as it's, you know, terrible, I'm sure there are services that will welcome you
[8684.74 --> 8686.90]  with open arms, Wix, Squarespace, etc.
[8686.90 --> 8690.24]  How much work have you done on your WordPress implementation, though?
[8690.34 --> 8690.94]  No, it sucks.
[8691.02 --> 8692.20]  I'm not trying to say it doesn't suck.
[8692.46 --> 8692.72]  Okay.
[8692.72 --> 8696.20]  Um, just as long as you're not trying to say it doesn't suck, because it definitely
[8696.20 --> 8696.60]  sucks.
[8696.76 --> 8697.68]  Yeah, no, it sucks a lot.
[8698.18 --> 8703.36]  Um, just I think what I'm trying to say is like, I wouldn't just automatically throw in
[8703.36 --> 8703.78]  the towel.
[8703.78 --> 8708.50]  Um, you might feel like you want to do it right now.
[8708.54 --> 8709.02]  You sure might.
[8709.68 --> 8710.96]  And I wouldn't blame you.
[8711.36 --> 8716.56]  But, you know, uh, even compared to like a year ago, the, the internet is more equipped
[8716.56 --> 8720.52]  to move your business off of WordPress than it ever has been.
[8720.52 --> 8723.74]  So there is, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
[8724.00 --> 8730.66]  Um, I suspect there's even going to be companies that pop up that are designed to help you with
[8730.66 --> 8730.96]  this.
[8731.46 --> 8735.94]  Um, and you know, you might not have the money to go that route.
[8736.00 --> 8738.76]  I work for a publishing company says context menu.
[8738.92 --> 8743.64]  We have over 50 sites running WordPress with hundreds of custom plugins.
[8743.64 --> 8744.56]  Yeah.
[8744.56 --> 8748.26]  The custom plugins part is that's painful.
[8748.54 --> 8749.42]  Oh yeah.
[8749.52 --> 8751.20]  It's all, it's all really rough.
[8751.56 --> 8756.28]  Um, like this could actually be a death blow for certain businesses.
[8756.28 --> 8756.86]  Oh, it will be.
[8756.94 --> 8757.82]  I'm a hundred percent certain.
[8757.98 --> 8760.74]  I don't know for how many, but I'm sure it'll take a couple of them out.
[8760.90 --> 8765.38]  There's a lot of businesses that, uh, you know, at a certain point, they almost become
[8765.38 --> 8770.04]  a passion project and it's like, I can keep this thing going, but that's pretty much all
[8770.04 --> 8770.54]  I've got.
[8770.54 --> 8773.66]  Uh, and a blow this big is just going to completely take it out.
[8774.24 --> 8778.64]  Um, watch the fire ship video on it.
[8778.70 --> 8781.58]  It was really, really good and explain both sides better than your notes did.
[8781.82 --> 8782.94]  Fire ship does good stuff.
[8783.10 --> 8785.38]  So I'm not too surprised.
[8785.54 --> 8789.08]  Uh, maybe if you're interested in, in seeing more on this, go check out fire ship.
[8789.88 --> 8799.90]  Um, Matt, Matt from labs web says WordPress is an, is awful as a product regardless of drama.
[8799.90 --> 8802.08]  Anytime is the right time to move on from it.
[8802.32 --> 8804.18]  Uh, I guess I don't disagree.
[8806.76 --> 8809.72]  I would, I would generally echo that sentiment.
[8809.80 --> 8812.76]  That being said, you don't want it ripped out from under you.
[8813.14 --> 8818.88]  Um, you would want to migrate off of it, um, carefully and while taking your time and
[8818.88 --> 8819.84]  stuff like that.
[8819.84 --> 8826.70]  Um, but yeah, this is, this is the, the wrong circumstances to be unbudging.
[8826.70 --> 8831.30]  Brady says WordPress is the notepad of blog sites.
[8831.38 --> 8832.26]  Change my mind.
[8832.36 --> 8836.36]  I won't be able to because you're unbudging, but I liked it.
[8836.94 --> 8837.36]  Yeah.
[8837.40 --> 8838.48]  I also don't disagree with that.
[8838.68 --> 8842.78]  Uh, WordPress is just, uh, I think their, their time has passed in my opinion.
[8842.78 --> 8846.22]  I know there's cool things that they do and stuff, but that's just, I don't know.
[8847.14 --> 8849.04]  Speaking of, I can't remember the last time I recommended them.
[8849.06 --> 8849.90]  Speaking of cool things.
[8849.96 --> 8851.00]  I used to make money through WordPress.
[8851.24 --> 8851.64]  Fun fact.
[8851.68 --> 8851.88]  Really?
[8852.20 --> 8852.40]  Yeah.
[8852.52 --> 8855.22]  I bought a package of WordPress themes.
[8855.66 --> 8858.28]  This was one of my many small business ideas that I had.
[8858.36 --> 8862.70]  I bought a package of WordPress themes and then I would just set up info pages for like
[8862.70 --> 8863.78]  local businesses and stuff.
[8864.22 --> 8865.04]  Cause it was really easy.
[8865.08 --> 8866.40]  I have the theme, so it looks nice.
[8866.66 --> 8868.56]  And I just put their info on it, put their logos on it.
[8868.56 --> 8869.08]  And I was like, cool.
[8869.86 --> 8870.52]  Wicked smart.
[8870.52 --> 8873.14]  It was, it was, uh, it was simple.
[8873.22 --> 8873.52]  It was easy.
[8873.58 --> 8873.86]  It was good.
[8873.96 --> 8875.10]  It was fantastic at the time.
[8875.18 --> 8876.22]  It was exactly what I needed.
[8876.40 --> 8877.82]  It was the best tool for the job at the time.
[8879.24 --> 8880.90]  And I would recommend moving off of it now.
[8882.10 --> 8883.30]  Let's move off this topic.
[8883.50 --> 8883.68]  Yeah.
[8883.82 --> 8885.30]  Behold the cyber cab.
[8886.44 --> 8891.98]  Oh, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, part-time CEO, held an event yesterday to unveil the company's
[8891.98 --> 8897.26]  long promised fully autonomous vehicles in the form of a new one, not the ones he said
[8897.26 --> 8898.38]  were fully autonomous before.
[8898.38 --> 8904.70]  The Tesla robo taxi, the so-called cyber cab currently consists of 20 apparently functional
[8904.70 --> 8905.68]  prototype vehicles.
[8906.26 --> 8910.64]  It lacks any steering wheels or pedals, which means it would need special authorization from
[8910.64 --> 8911.10]  regulators.
[8911.50 --> 8916.08]  Despite lacking any driver and appearing roughly the size of a standard car, it only has two
[8916.08 --> 8916.50]  seats.
[8916.76 --> 8920.76]  It also lacks a charging plug and will apparently charge wirelessly.
[8921.76 --> 8926.22]  Musk says that Tesla will launch a fully autonomous driving in Tesla, in Texas and California
[8926.22 --> 8932.88]  next year and that the cyber cab will enter production in 2026, the 10 year anniversary
[8932.88 --> 8936.86]  of when he said full self-driving would be available, though it could be delayed until
[8936.86 --> 8937.52]  2027.
[8938.24 --> 8944.00]  Musk also unveiled a prototype for a driverless 20 passenger robo van, which has no official
[8944.00 --> 8945.74]  timetable for development or production.
[8945.74 --> 8948.82]  And this is a great tweet from 2017.
[8950.70 --> 8952.70]  At Bore something, I forget.
[8953.26 --> 8957.54]  Every two or three weeks, a tech guy accidentally invents the concept of the city bus.
[8958.80 --> 8959.32]  Yes.
[8960.36 --> 8965.38]  The event also showed off the humanoid optimist robot again, which Musk claims would one day
[8965.38 --> 8969.32]  be able to be a teacher, babysit your kids and be your friend.
[8969.32 --> 8974.62]  The bots were shown serving drinks and interacting with guests at the event, but these were apparently
[8974.62 --> 8977.20]  at least partially telepiloted by human operators.
[8977.80 --> 8982.70]  Following the event, Tesla stock dropped by 8% while stocks for Uber and Lyft rose.
[8984.78 --> 8985.26]  Cool.
[8987.66 --> 8989.22]  Well, good luck with that.
[8989.44 --> 8990.22]  I think it looks neat.
[8991.14 --> 8991.40]  Yeah.
[8991.80 --> 8993.76]  It looks better than the regular Cybertruck.
[8994.54 --> 8994.80]  Yeah.
[8995.36 --> 8995.68]  Well.
[8996.18 --> 8997.48]  I mean, that's a low bar.
[8997.54 --> 8998.34]  It's not a truck, though.
[8998.34 --> 8998.96]  So, yeah.
[8999.88 --> 9000.62]  But, yeah.
[9000.84 --> 9001.54]  I think it looks neat.
[9001.94 --> 9002.14]  Yeah.
[9002.78 --> 9003.52]  Two-seater, though.
[9003.74 --> 9005.46]  That's, um...
[9005.46 --> 9007.66]  kind of a downer.
[9007.82 --> 9011.86]  What's with the, like, the, like, Star Wars shuttle-looking version?
[9012.56 --> 9013.46]  This one on the right.
[9013.52 --> 9014.34]  Oh, no, that's the bus.
[9015.20 --> 9016.74]  Yeah, okay, so that's what I'm talking about, then.
[9016.82 --> 9017.68]  Not the Cyber Cab.
[9017.92 --> 9018.06]  Yeah.
[9018.06 --> 9019.02]  I think the bus looks neat.
[9019.80 --> 9019.94]  Yeah.
[9020.12 --> 9022.82]  The Cyber Cab just looks like a slightly different Model X, as far as I can tell.
[9023.98 --> 9026.64]  And it looks like between a Cybertruck and a Model X.
[9027.10 --> 9027.38]  This one?
[9027.58 --> 9027.80]  Yeah.
[9027.80 --> 9028.40]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9028.40 --> 9029.12]  It's got kind of that angular thing.
[9029.12 --> 9030.06]  It's got that angled butt.
[9030.20 --> 9030.48]  Yeah.
[9030.78 --> 9031.00]  Yeah.
[9031.20 --> 9032.00]  Yeah, I don't mind it.
[9032.16 --> 9032.40]  Sure.
[9032.54 --> 9033.06]  I don't mind it.
[9033.12 --> 9034.02]  It looks better than the Cybertruck.
[9034.66 --> 9034.88]  Yeah.
[9035.70 --> 9037.22]  Anyway, yeah, good luck, everybody.
[9037.56 --> 9038.24]  To the moon, dude.
[9038.44 --> 9039.20]  To the moon.
[9039.58 --> 9040.58]  Or through the ground.
[9040.64 --> 9041.42]  Stock just went down.
[9041.52 --> 9042.24]  Invest now, right?
[9042.36 --> 9042.64]  Yeah.
[9042.90 --> 9043.10]  Yeah.
[9043.26 --> 9043.52]  Not investment advice.
[9043.52 --> 9044.62]  This is not investment advice.
[9046.26 --> 9047.40]  M1 Macs are breaking.
[9047.40 --> 9053.12]  Since mid-2023, a significant number of M1 iMac users have reported screen degradation,
[9053.36 --> 9056.76]  resulting in a pattern of horizontal lines appearing across their displays.
[9057.30 --> 9060.94]  The issue typically crops up after a couple years of use, meaning that the devices are out
[9060.94 --> 9061.44]  of warranty.
[9062.12 --> 9065.70]  Apple has yet to acknowledge the problem, though one user reported that the technician
[9065.70 --> 9071.10]  they went to blamed the issue on a flex cable powering the LCD, burning out because it has
[9071.10 --> 9074.90]  to sustain voltage of about 50 volts at the screen's highest brightness setting.
[9074.90 --> 9082.78]  Due to how the devices are constructed, fixing this issue typically means replacing the whole screen at a cost of around $600 to $700.
[9083.58 --> 9089.14]  It is currently unclear whether Apple has fixed the issue in more recent generations of iMac.
[9089.62 --> 9097.74]  And our discussion question here is, and this is one that I kind of wrote, is does Apple get an adequate amount of
[9097.74 --> 9099.02]  journalistic scrutiny?
[9099.02 --> 9108.56]  Because it seems like in the last 20 years, they have gone from being covered by professional journalists
[9108.56 --> 9114.26]  to still being covered by professional journalists, but also having cultivated a following of fans.
[9115.48 --> 9120.30]  I think professional journalism is, I think this is almost a different conversation than it's that a lot of professional
[9120.30 --> 9121.18]  journalism is dying.
[9121.70 --> 9127.94]  But Apple is, uh, is, Apple almost uniquely plays the game.
[9127.94 --> 9137.50]  So well, at least in the tech space of, of the, the sort of the, the praise for access model.
[9138.54 --> 9145.44]  Um, if you, if you not only it's not, and it's not even as simple as if you say the right things about Apple,
[9145.44 --> 9149.24]  you'll get invited to the Steve Jobs theater and you'll, you know, attend the keynotes or whatever.
[9149.32 --> 9150.24]  It's, it's not that simple.
[9150.48 --> 9150.64]  Yeah.
[9150.64 --> 9156.60]  It's, you have to not only say the right things, you have to be the right things.
[9156.68 --> 9158.52]  You have to, you have to,
[9158.52 --> 9164.38]  what's the word I'm looking for?
[9164.48 --> 9166.86]  You, you, you almost have to have the right aura.
[9167.04 --> 9167.70]  You have to.
[9168.22 --> 9169.06]  That is a trend.
[9169.12 --> 9170.92]  That is very good.
[9171.50 --> 9172.02]  Good job.
[9172.74 --> 9174.60]  You've communicated to the, the young.
[9174.60 --> 9183.04]  You have to personify the ideal Apple customer is what you have to do.
[9183.56 --> 9191.32]  And I, um, I almost wonder if that's detrimental for Apple in the longterm.
[9193.20 --> 9197.64]  I don't, I don't know if they, I don't, I mean, they get a lot of criticism, but I almost,
[9197.64 --> 9205.66]  I like seeing, seeing all the, seeing all the better things about iOS 18, right?
[9205.88 --> 9207.66]  Seeing how much better it is.
[9208.38 --> 9213.82]  I don't know if it makes me, I don't know if it makes me think that they have heard all
[9213.82 --> 9216.50]  the things that they're supposed to be doing and then just weren't doing it.
[9216.78 --> 9220.54]  Or if they were shut off from it and are finally hearing it.
[9220.54 --> 9227.12]  Like, I don't know what it is exactly that, that made them sort of ignore these obvious,
[9227.26 --> 9230.94]  egregious, glaring issues for so long, like not being able to rearrange your, your icons
[9230.94 --> 9232.14]  on your home screen and stuff like that.
[9232.36 --> 9232.48]  Yeah.
[9232.52 --> 9236.24]  But people were pointing the issue out even when there was more negative journalism.
[9236.24 --> 9238.12]  They were, but were those voices powerful enough?
[9238.12 --> 9239.10]  I guess is the question.
[9239.24 --> 9239.72]  They're pretty loud.
[9239.72 --> 9243.36]  Is Apple under enough scrutiny, but are they loud in the right places?
[9243.36 --> 9249.04]  Remember, you're not necessarily reading a random discussion forum on Mac rumors.
[9249.04 --> 9254.72]  If you're, if you're a decision maker at Apple, like the people with access, the people who
[9254.72 --> 9259.88]  can actually talk directly to decision makers, are they putting the right amount of pressure
[9259.88 --> 9260.32]  on them?
[9261.28 --> 9264.32]  Cause like, I'm looking at this, I'm looking at this screen issue, right?
[9266.34 --> 9273.72]  When, when ASUS didn't acknowledge the SD card problem with the ally, we weren't the only
[9273.72 --> 9277.92]  ones having meetings with top level executives, basically saying you guys need to do this.
[9279.04 --> 9279.26]  Yeah.
[9279.84 --> 9284.76]  I don't know if anybody holds that kind of power over Apple and I don't think Apple wants
[9284.76 --> 9285.06]  that.
[9285.58 --> 9286.76]  Oh, they definitely don't.
[9287.00 --> 9291.26]  But will that be, but will that be damaging to them in the longer term is the question
[9291.26 --> 9291.82]  that I'm asking.
[9291.82 --> 9294.44]  I have a hard time believing, honestly, any company wants that.
[9294.60 --> 9300.00]  I feel like most companies will comply with that to try to, uh, soften the blow.
[9300.00 --> 9301.20]  I actually disagree.
[9301.88 --> 9307.78]  Um, and no company is, is monolithic, but there are certainly ones that I've encountered
[9307.78 --> 9310.72]  that value criticism.
[9311.84 --> 9312.32]  Okay.
[9312.72 --> 9313.36]  At a high level.
[9313.54 --> 9317.86]  I think what I was pointing out was the, the public nature of a lot of the criticism that
[9317.86 --> 9318.64]  happened around ASUS.
[9318.72 --> 9319.86]  I don't think anybody wants that.
[9320.36 --> 9323.58]  No, I don't think anybody wants a media firestorm necessarily.
[9323.58 --> 9323.90]  Yeah.
[9324.26 --> 9330.90]  But I think that, um, I do definitely think there are companies that really want measured,
[9331.28 --> 9332.98]  accurate, constructive criticism.
[9333.12 --> 9333.40]  Definitely.
[9333.60 --> 9338.02]  There are, there are quite a few companies that like, I don't know if Apple does pay money
[9338.02 --> 9339.98]  to have that, let alone just want it.
[9340.06 --> 9343.10]  CMD Karini says, who says Apple isn't adequately addressing the issue?
[9343.22 --> 9344.42]  Well, they haven't acknowledged it.
[9344.50 --> 9346.68]  That's step one of addressing the issue.
[9346.74 --> 9347.86]  And Apple has a long history.
[9347.86 --> 9354.48]  Yeah, they have, they have a long history of ignoring things so hard, uh, hoping that
[9354.48 --> 9361.22]  they'll go away only to finally acknowledge them only if they, if they get enough backlash.
[9361.44 --> 9365.90]  Um, butterfly keyboard, for example, bump gate on the, the older Mac books.
[9365.90 --> 9368.42]  Like this is, this is not, this is not a new thing.
[9368.58 --> 9369.78]  Let's, let's not pretend.
[9370.50 --> 9374.32]  Um, you're holding it wrong.
[9374.42 --> 9375.44]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[9375.58 --> 9376.00]  Vertigo one.
[9376.00 --> 9378.34]  Um, that's about it.
[9378.88 --> 9383.32]  Fisker can't sell its cars due to server issues.
[9383.94 --> 9384.26]  Ruff.
[9384.42 --> 9392.08]  This is such a cautionary tale and we should all listen extremely intently for the next
[9392.08 --> 9392.80]  two minutes.
[9393.66 --> 9399.04]  As part of its bankruptcy proceedings, EV company Fisker has been attempting to liquidate its
[9399.04 --> 9401.68]  assets in order to pay back creditors.
[9401.68 --> 9408.62]  In June, rental company American lease agreed to purchase Fisker's remaining 3,300 vehicles
[9408.62 --> 9410.04]  for $46.3 million.
[9410.94 --> 9417.74]  As of last week, American lease had paid $42.5 million and had accepted delivery of a third
[9417.74 --> 9418.54]  of the vehicles.
[9418.54 --> 9426.48]  Last Friday, Fisker revealed that they couldn't transfer the vehicle's cloud link to another
[9426.48 --> 9429.94]  company's servers due to an underlying technical issue.
[9429.94 --> 9435.50]  It is unclear how long Fisker knew about this problem prior to informing American lease.
[9435.50 --> 9440.98]  I wonder what that issue is.
[9441.14 --> 9442.04]  It doesn't matter.
[9442.22 --> 9443.36]  Like it's a bankruptcy thing.
[9443.40 --> 9444.66]  So just give them the servers.
[9445.00 --> 9450.80]  The point is, well, not necessarily because not every car will be owned by American lease.
[9451.64 --> 9453.14]  There are still end users out there.
[9453.20 --> 9454.42]  So it could be a privacy issue.
[9454.50 --> 9455.14]  It could be anything.
[9455.24 --> 9456.22]  It could be a technical issue.
[9456.28 --> 9457.48]  It could be a contractual issue.
[9457.52 --> 9458.04]  We don't know.
[9458.04 --> 9464.00]  Because American lease would struggle to run the fleet of vehicles without the cloud-based
[9464.00 --> 9468.22]  features, the company has filed an emergency objection to Fisker's liquidation plan.
[9468.80 --> 9472.70]  The DOJ has filed its own objection based on claims that Fisker has been asking owners
[9472.70 --> 9475.46]  of their vehicles to cover the costs of their own recall repairs.
[9476.10 --> 9480.10]  Fisker also appears to be under investigation by the SEC, but the exact focus of the investigation
[9480.10 --> 9481.32]  is currently unknown.
[9488.04 --> 9490.24]  So here's the problem.
[9490.60 --> 9493.42]  The problem is not Fisker necessarily here.
[9493.56 --> 9496.94]  The problem is not just this car or this server.
[9497.24 --> 9506.00]  The problem is that this will happen to basically everything that you own once it is reliant on
[9506.00 --> 9507.00]  cloud-based services.
[9507.14 --> 9514.10]  Absolutely everything that you purchase, because is it really a purchase if it just stops working
[9514.10 --> 9514.68]  when somebody...
[9514.68 --> 9515.06]  Everything you rent.
[9515.66 --> 9515.80]  Yeah.
[9515.80 --> 9519.54]  When somebody sort of decides they don't feel like paying for it anymore.
[9522.46 --> 9524.82]  I forget how I started the sentence, so it doesn't matter.
[9524.92 --> 9533.36]  The point is that everything is literally one bad decision or one key person being hit by
[9533.36 --> 9540.76]  a bus or one infrastructure error away from being a brick.
[9541.02 --> 9542.98]  And this is terrifying.
[9544.30 --> 9544.74]  Yeah.
[9545.80 --> 9547.86]  Back to Tesla for a minute.
[9547.86 --> 9551.52]  Back to every single day that goes by, I like my car more.
[9552.26 --> 9558.00]  They have done a very good job, actually, by and large, of providing OTA updates to their
[9558.00 --> 9560.58]  vehicles, going back to pretty much the first ones.
[9561.10 --> 9566.72]  From day one, I said these things are going to be a disaster because they keep revving the
[9566.72 --> 9567.80]  hardware so frequently.
[9567.80 --> 9582.72]  And the ongoing overhead of supporting all of these various models and all of these various iterations of the hardware is going to be completely untenable.
[9583.06 --> 9585.50]  And they're just going to start sort of deprecating them.
[9585.50 --> 9587.30]  I was wrong.
[9587.30 --> 9593.60]  They have actually done overall a pretty spectacular job in that regard.
[9594.08 --> 9596.44]  They've done a pretty bad job of a lot of other things.
[9596.62 --> 9598.82]  But that, I got to give credit.
[9598.82 --> 9604.30]  But that doesn't mean that I was overall wrong about that problem.
[9605.14 --> 9615.06]  And Fisker, anyone who bought a Fisker or 3,300 Fiskers is going to, is finding that out the hard way.
[9615.06 --> 9618.66]  And I'm just, I don't know what to do.
[9620.24 --> 9621.76]  What do we do, Luke?
[9622.54 --> 9623.22]  Help me.
[9630.02 --> 9642.54]  I want to say vote with your wallet, but like what can you even, how many cars even are there that aren't basically susceptible to a similar issue like this right now that you would buy new?
[9642.54 --> 9646.08]  Yeah, this, I wrote this in the, in the topic doc.
[9647.66 --> 9650.72]  This is f***ed and applies to basically every car.
[9651.04 --> 9651.80]  Yeah, yeah.
[9651.86 --> 9656.28]  For prep for this one, I'd love to have a list of car brands that existed in the 90s and don't exist anymore.
[9656.50 --> 9661.18]  If you think your car company is going to last and this won't be a problem, you are literally wrong.
[9661.66 --> 9662.10]  Pontiac.
[9662.64 --> 9663.28]  Yeah, there's one.
[9665.00 --> 9665.40]  Mercury.
[9665.80 --> 9666.48]  Yeah, nice.
[9667.62 --> 9668.80]  Is Saturn still around?
[9669.56 --> 9669.88]  Nope.
[9670.26 --> 9672.48]  Speaking of planet-based car companies.
[9672.54 --> 9672.98]  I know, right?
[9673.10 --> 9673.38]  Saab.
[9673.52 --> 9674.44]  Saab, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9674.54 --> 9674.94]  Scion.
[9675.10 --> 9675.34]  Scion.
[9676.20 --> 9677.32]  Not 90s, but DeLorean.
[9677.58 --> 9677.72]  Yeah.
[9677.82 --> 9678.38]  Oldsmobile.
[9679.10 --> 9683.26]  Yeah, a lot of these were bought out by other companies, but that's sort of what's happening here.
[9683.40 --> 9684.42]  Suzuki pulled out of Canada.
[9685.06 --> 9685.46]  Yeah.
[9687.74 --> 9688.22]  Datsun.
[9688.58 --> 9689.02]  Daewoo.
[9689.22 --> 9689.54]  Yep.
[9691.36 --> 9692.60]  It's a lot of companies.
[9692.98 --> 9693.22]  Yep.
[9693.22 --> 9698.20]  I mean, some of them have like still exist, but have changed ownership like multiple times.
[9698.20 --> 9701.66]  Like Jaguar is not a British car manufacturer.
[9702.98 --> 9706.06]  Who has owned Jaguar?
[9706.44 --> 9708.06]  I thought they were like Australian or something.
[9708.26 --> 9711.70]  They became nationalized in 1975 due to financial difficulties.
[9712.10 --> 9712.86]  I don't know if they were British.
[9712.86 --> 9716.92]  Uh, but in 1984, uh, it became its own company again.
[9717.30 --> 9722.82]  Ford Motors purchased them in 1999 and then Land Rover in 2000 selling both to Tata Motors
[9722.82 --> 9724.00]  in 2008.
[9724.42 --> 9725.12]  Where's Tata?
[9725.40 --> 9726.36]  Uh, India, I think.
[9726.58 --> 9726.90]  Okay.
[9726.90 --> 9730.36]  Was it an Australian movie where they talk about it then or something?
[9730.62 --> 9731.68]  There was, there was something.
[9731.80 --> 9732.52]  I don't, I don't remember.
[9732.76 --> 9733.08]  Anyways.
[9737.06 --> 9737.46]  Yeah.
[9737.66 --> 9737.94]  Yeah.
[9738.00 --> 9739.82]  Tata is based in, uh, Mumbai.
[9742.22 --> 9743.04]  Wild though, right?
[9743.28 --> 9743.98]  Uh, AMC.
[9744.10 --> 9744.84]  There's another one.
[9745.58 --> 9750.16]  Um, Holden was apparently the, uh, the Australian one.
[9750.32 --> 9751.58]  A lot of these were bought.
[9751.74 --> 9752.04]  Yeah.
[9755.24 --> 9755.72]  All right.
[9755.74 --> 9756.26]  What else we got?
[9756.30 --> 9756.84]  Is there good news?
[9757.00 --> 9757.40]  Plymouth.
[9757.82 --> 9758.46]  Is there good news?
[9758.82 --> 9761.10]  Behold, Nintendo's Alarmo.
[9761.84 --> 9766.72]  On Wednesday, Nintendo announced new hardware that has spent 10 years developing.
[9767.06 --> 9769.38]  A $100 alarm clock called Alarmo.
[9769.94 --> 9774.22]  Alarmo has an optional motion detection feature and will make game sounds when its user moves.
[9774.78 --> 9778.48]  Users can use gestures to enable snooze on their alarm and turn it off simply by getting
[9778.48 --> 9778.96]  out of bed.
[9779.32 --> 9780.90]  It likewise tracks the user's sleep.
[9781.24 --> 9784.52]  Nintendo suggests not using the motion tracking feature if you sleep with another person.
[9784.52 --> 9794.48]  Tell me the product is only for forever alone without telling me that.
[9794.48 --> 9796.04]  In addition to this announcement...
[9796.04 --> 9796.88]  Probably kids.
[9797.08 --> 9800.20]  ...Nintendo has published a four-part interview with the Clox developers.
[9801.62 --> 9802.06]  Oh.
[9804.18 --> 9804.58]  Um.
[9804.58 --> 9806.94]  Discussion question.
[9806.94 --> 9809.76]  Does Nintendo not understand what people want from them?
[9809.76 --> 9815.40]  Or is there actually a huge untapped market for Nintendo-themed alarm clocks that you can't use if you have a girlfriend?
[9815.40 --> 9817.40]  I...
[9817.40 --> 9817.76]  I...
[9817.76 --> 9817.90]  I...
[9817.90 --> 9820.88]  I just saw this and I was like, what?
[9821.68 --> 9827.66]  Like, Nintendo has made all kinds of things over the years, especially if you go back to their pre-video game days.
[9827.86 --> 9830.40]  Like, they're an old company and...
[9830.40 --> 9831.36]  Playing cards.
[9831.50 --> 9835.24]  Yeah, they've created some utterly unbelievable products.
[9835.34 --> 9837.54]  But this one, I'm just like...
[9837.54 --> 9838.48]  Why?
[9838.64 --> 9839.78]  Who was asking for this?
[9841.00 --> 9841.54]  Like, I could...
[9841.54 --> 9841.96]  I could...
[9841.96 --> 9844.02]  I could see if it was a Switch dock or something.
[9844.16 --> 9845.32]  Switch dock with a built-in clock.
[9845.40 --> 9846.04]  Like, I don't...
[9846.04 --> 9846.52]  I don't know...
[9846.52 --> 9847.48]  They've been interested...
[9847.48 --> 9848.04]  There's a...
[9848.04 --> 9848.06]  What?
[9848.30 --> 9851.66]  There's an add-on thing you can get for Pokemon Go that tracks your sleep.
[9852.14 --> 9855.52]  There's a game called Pokemon Sleep.
[9856.56 --> 9857.62]  And now they have this.
[9857.68 --> 9861.66]  They've been really into sleep stuff for actually a long time.
[9861.66 --> 9867.96]  This isn't their only thing right now that deals with sleep.
[9869.22 --> 9874.90]  El Bardo says, I love Nintendo because they do their own thing without paying attention to trends.
[9875.48 --> 9876.90]  Sometimes you get the Switch.
[9877.32 --> 9878.72]  Sometimes you get this.
[9879.36 --> 9879.74]  Yeah.
[9880.54 --> 9882.04]  You gotta diversify.
[9882.56 --> 9883.44]  What the...
[9883.44 --> 9883.66]  Oh.
[9884.00 --> 9884.70]  I just...
[9884.70 --> 9885.48]  Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[9885.56 --> 9886.38]  Maybe we should...
[9886.38 --> 9887.98]  Maybe we should do an alarm clock.
[9888.08 --> 9888.66]  Like, I just...
[9888.66 --> 9891.64]  It just feels so random.
[9891.96 --> 9896.60]  Why don't you want the sleep motion tracking of all of your employees in the Linus Town?
[9897.86 --> 9898.16]  What?
[9898.28 --> 9899.24]  Why are we talking about the Linus Town again?
[9899.24 --> 9901.06]  You can make sure everyone goes to bed on time.
[9901.16 --> 9901.46]  It's good.
[9901.60 --> 9904.74]  It'll only work if you sleep with somebody else.
[9905.26 --> 9906.58]  It'll only work.
[9906.70 --> 9907.32]  It'll only work.
[9907.32 --> 9909.14]  Because we need more members of the Linus Town.
[9909.24 --> 9909.62]  Absolutely.
[9910.28 --> 9911.58]  Oh my goodness, you guys.
[9911.94 --> 9913.64]  We're not doing Linus Town.
[9915.56 --> 9918.48]  Even if I had the money, I wouldn't spend it on Linus Town.
[9918.66 --> 9919.72]  That would be embarrassing.
[9921.22 --> 9925.60]  That would actually be, like, cringe-worthingly narcissistic.
[9926.96 --> 9928.22]  Yeah, but we all want it.
[9928.22 --> 9929.36]  More so than everything else?
[9929.44 --> 9929.76]  Yes.
[9931.42 --> 9932.92]  They're gonna back me up on this one.
[9932.96 --> 9934.02]  They hate agreeing with me.
[9934.08 --> 9934.80]  But guys, come on.
[9934.98 --> 9936.46]  It's almost to the point...
[9936.46 --> 9939.84]  It's almost to the point where it's annoying to type in our website domains.
[9939.84 --> 9942.08]  Because they all start with either Linus or L.
[9942.66 --> 9943.86]  Every single one of them.
[9943.98 --> 9946.20]  Searching for your name on documents?
[9946.20 --> 9946.86]  They don't.
[9947.04 --> 9947.96]  Or in Teams?
[9947.96 --> 9950.14]  The ones is, like, impossible.
[9951.50 --> 9952.00]  Floatplane?
[9952.14 --> 9953.10]  You can use that against me?
[9953.84 --> 9954.90]  The one that...
[9956.38 --> 9957.12]  Oh, well...
[9957.12 --> 9958.24]  LTT Store.
[9958.26 --> 9959.10]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[9959.10 --> 9960.40]  LTT Labs.
[9960.90 --> 9962.28]  Flying Ness Media Group.
[9962.38 --> 9962.98]  Creator Warehouse.
[9962.98 --> 9963.62]  Flying Ness Tech Tips.
[9963.62 --> 9965.02]  Creator Warehouse.com, boom.
[9965.66 --> 9966.52]  Short line is stuck.
[9966.52 --> 9966.78]  Weird.
[9966.86 --> 9968.66]  It seems like it redirected to something.
[9969.20 --> 9969.76]  Well, yeah.
[9969.76 --> 9970.32]  It seems like you...
[9970.32 --> 9971.60]  Fine, I will use this against you.
[9971.60 --> 9971.80]  You found a way to...
[9971.80 --> 9972.28]  Boom, got him.
[9972.36 --> 9972.58]  Yeah.
[9972.58 --> 9972.94]  Yeah.
[9973.30 --> 9974.04]  Floatplane.com.
[9974.08 --> 9974.46]  Let's go.
[9974.68 --> 9974.90]  Yeah.
[9975.00 --> 9976.46]  Oh, look at this video coming.
[9976.62 --> 9977.80]  Young people try Windows XP.
[9978.60 --> 9979.62]  Oh, that's actually kind of cool.
[9979.78 --> 9980.62]  Yeah, that's...
[9980.62 --> 9988.60]  The question we set out to answer is, is Windows XP actually as goaded as the people who remember
[9988.60 --> 9989.52]  it think it is?
[9989.68 --> 9990.08]  Yes.
[9990.20 --> 9990.44]  Yes.
[9990.44 --> 9992.94]  You may be disappointed.
[9993.38 --> 9994.00]  I don't care.
[9994.22 --> 9994.50]  Okay.
[9994.72 --> 9995.10]  They're wrong.
[9995.10 --> 9995.66]  Windows 7.
[9995.66 --> 9996.10]  Kids are wrong.
[9996.34 --> 9997.38]  Windows 7, goat.
[9998.38 --> 9999.06]  Well, yeah.
[10000.76 --> 10001.16]  Yeah.
[10001.56 --> 10002.54]  But Windows XP is safe.
[10002.54 --> 10002.90]  We'll see.
[10003.02 --> 10008.34]  Windows XP was better because you can right-click something and it uses it as a click instead
[10008.34 --> 10010.32]  of having to left-click and then right-click.
[10010.32 --> 10012.26]  That is actually the best thing ever.
[10012.26 --> 10015.28]  The problem with the wrong opinions about the people that are going to be in this video
[10015.28 --> 10021.50]  is that they are valuing convenience over quality.
[10022.12 --> 10024.42]  You are making a lot of assumptions about these people.
[10024.44 --> 10025.00]  There's only one...
[10025.00 --> 10025.70]  Why don't you just wait?
[10025.90 --> 10030.64]  There's only one settings application for the whole computer instead of two that are split
[10030.64 --> 10034.14]  and then one of them opens another one and some of the settings are in one but they're
[10034.14 --> 10035.16]  also in another one.
[10035.16 --> 10038.82]  But they probably won't have to open on Windows 11 so they'll think that's better.
[10039.64 --> 10041.30]  I'm just waiting for Windows 12.
[10042.74 --> 10044.80]  Intel has unveiled Arrow Lake.
[10045.28 --> 10053.76]  Their new Core Ultra 200S series CPUs, also known as Arrow Lake S, have been announced
[10053.76 --> 10057.18]  and sales and pre-orders will begin on October 24th.
[10057.60 --> 10062.50]  For about the same price as 14th gen Core chips, you'll be getting parity performance,
[10063.06 --> 10065.96]  asterisk, at about half the power consumption.
[10065.96 --> 10072.00]  Of course, you'll need to buy a new Z890 motherboard since Arrow Lake S needs the new LGA1851 socket
[10072.00 --> 10077.70]  and also Z890 boards do not support DDR4 so you'll probably need some new RAM.
[10078.54 --> 10080.06]  Also, the performance isn't quite the same.
[10080.06 --> 10089.30]  Team Blue admits the Geo mean of the gaming performance of the flagship Core Ultra 9 285k is actually 5% less than the 14900k,
[10089.30 --> 10096.50]  but they do claim an 8% increase in single-threaded performance and 15% in multi-threaded workloads compared to 14th gen.
[10096.94 --> 10100.38]  Oh, and they have NPUs, but they're not good enough for Copilot Plus.
[10101.82 --> 10102.30]  So...
[10102.30 --> 10102.72]  Nice.
[10102.72 --> 10110.74]  So our discussion question is, if the performance was identical to 14th gen at half the power consumption,
[10111.94 --> 10113.96]  would anyone find these chips worth the upgrade?
[10115.60 --> 10116.68]  Upgrade? I don't know.
[10116.78 --> 10117.52]  I think we are...
[10117.52 --> 10119.00]  Happy about a new purchase? Definitely.
[10119.20 --> 10124.40]  I think we are long past upgrading from the last generation product.
[10124.40 --> 10127.16]  I think we've been long past for a long time, in my opinion.
[10127.16 --> 10131.94]  And I think we've probably beat this horse enough talking about the latest iPhones,
[10132.22 --> 10134.90]  and there was something else that came out recently that I was like, eh.
[10135.36 --> 10137.54]  I mean, I don't think that's necessarily true of everything.
[10137.74 --> 10144.82]  I think on the GPU side, we should expect a generational upgrade for how bloody long we wait for a new generation of product.
[10144.98 --> 10146.86]  That's fair. You don't wait as long for CPU, though.
[10147.04 --> 10151.04]  I think also it's very likely that a lot of the people watching the show right now
[10151.68 --> 10157.10]  either don't pay for their own power or have relatively cheap power.
[10157.72 --> 10157.88]  Yeah.
[10157.88 --> 10159.58]  There are places in the world where...
[10159.58 --> 10161.34]  We have less Euro audience here, but...
[10161.34 --> 10166.90]  Yeah. There's quite a few places in the world where power costs are like a huge factor.
[10167.42 --> 10170.26]  So you might not care about it, but someone else might.
[10170.62 --> 10172.62]  But that might just mean this might not be for you.
[10172.72 --> 10173.90]  This product might not be for you.
[10173.94 --> 10175.36]  You already have a CPU that's pretty good.
[10176.60 --> 10177.80]  It's probably not for you.
[10178.62 --> 10183.68]  Assuming your power costs are also either not way too high or you don't pay for it.
[10183.68 --> 10185.60]  I didn't...
[10185.60 --> 10186.72]  And Fleming.
[10186.86 --> 10189.48]  I didn't mean everyone watching.
[10190.04 --> 10190.30]  Yeah.
[10191.60 --> 10192.68]  It just meant a lot.
[10192.68 --> 10197.70]  In other breaking news, yes, piracy does cause a drop in revenue for games.
[10197.70 --> 10201.48]  A peer-reviewed study...
[10201.48 --> 10203.34]  But I really don't agree with this study.
[10203.62 --> 10204.00]  Here we go.
[10204.04 --> 10204.80]  Putting that out there.
[10204.80 --> 10209.36]  A peer-reviewed study compared games with Denuvo DRM and found that games where a crack
[10209.36 --> 10213.56]  was available at launch suffered an average loss of 19% of legitimate sales in those early
[10213.56 --> 10215.94]  weeks compared to games where no crack was available.
[10216.16 --> 10216.88]  How do you measure that?
[10216.88 --> 10224.02]  However, piracy resulted in nearly zero mean total revenue loss when the DRM survived for
[10224.02 --> 10228.12]  12 or more weeks because new sales drop off quickly after the first few months.
[10228.86 --> 10233.66]  According to the study, there was no apparent connection between the type of game and its
[10233.66 --> 10236.32]  likelihood of getting cracked earlier or later.
[10238.72 --> 10245.24]  Discussion question here is, should game publishers consider ditching DRM a few months post-launch?
[10245.24 --> 10247.02]  Hey, what would you think of that, Luke?
[10247.60 --> 10248.60]  It's an interesting idea, actually.
[10248.64 --> 10249.34]  Launch DRM.
[10249.86 --> 10250.14]  Yeah.
[10250.30 --> 10255.82]  And then, okay, you know, it's going to be cheaper now anyway, so if you're not desperate
[10255.82 --> 10262.12]  to play it immediately anyway, then we can just screw off and take our hooks out of your
[10262.12 --> 10263.40]  kernel or whatever.
[10264.78 --> 10266.08]  I actually kind of love that.
[10266.18 --> 10267.92]  It's an interesting way to go for sure.
[10269.78 --> 10272.44]  I want to say, I really want to know who funded the study.
[10275.24 --> 10278.02]  I want to know if it's time for Wine After Dark.
[10282.72 --> 10283.04]  Dan?
[10283.76 --> 10284.28]  Dan?
[10284.28 --> 10284.46]  Dan?
[10284.56 --> 10285.62]  I thought you were asking Luke.
[10285.70 --> 10286.26]  No, I'm not.
[10286.32 --> 10286.92]  I'm asking Dan.
[10287.04 --> 10287.68]  I think it should be.
[10287.76 --> 10288.82]  It looks like I'll get out of here soon.
[10289.20 --> 10289.38]  Yeah.
[10290.82 --> 10294.28]  I will push the button, and then I will push these other buttons.
[10295.38 --> 10296.38]  There's a lot of buttons.
[10298.02 --> 10298.80]  Which one is it?
[10298.80 --> 10302.00]  Well, they say nothing was a problem, which is what it is.
[10303.72 --> 10304.10]  Sorry?
[10305.08 --> 10308.22]  Here's the Declaration of Competing Interest.
[10308.54 --> 10311.74]  What is up with the capitalization on the word credit?
[10311.98 --> 10312.44]  I don't know.
[10313.80 --> 10314.70]  Declaration of Competing Interest.
[10314.70 --> 10316.70]  The authors declare they have no...
[10317.24 --> 10319.28]  That means so much.
[10319.48 --> 10319.90]  Okay.
[10319.90 --> 10322.54]  All right.
[10324.42 --> 10324.82]  Okay.
[10326.16 --> 10327.38]  Make of it what you will.
[10327.48 --> 10330.00]  You can like it or not like it or believe it or not believe it.
[10332.42 --> 10339.96]  I don't think anyone's ever going to agree on this because by its very definition, it cannot be measured.
[10340.28 --> 10340.42]  No.
[10344.22 --> 10346.20]  Because you're talking about different games now.
[10347.00 --> 10349.50]  It's like there's so many variables involved with that.
[10349.50 --> 10350.50]  There are so many variables.
[10350.50 --> 10352.68]  What if that game just wasn't going to sell as much?
[10352.94 --> 10353.98]  There are a lot of variables.
[10356.24 --> 10356.64]  Like...
[10356.64 --> 10363.72]  And we know that our ability to predict that is not perfect, or else certain games wouldn't be made.
[10365.42 --> 10366.30]  I don't know.
[10369.10 --> 10370.50]  How about some merch messages?
[10370.98 --> 10371.30]  Do it.
[10372.34 --> 10373.70]  I've been loving my hat.
[10374.38 --> 10375.06]  And as if...
[10375.06 --> 10378.82]  The person who did the study is a developer who made a game.
[10379.50 --> 10380.50]  So, like...
[10380.50 --> 10386.86]  I'm not saying it makes them biased, but I think just having a statement that says, like,
[10386.90 --> 10390.00]  we're definitely not, is also not necessarily fair.
[10390.66 --> 10391.02]  Anyways.
[10391.20 --> 10397.04]  What if you just have no DRM and then understand that the people who pirate your game are not going to be the people that purchased it?
[10397.16 --> 10398.36]  And there will be some.
[10398.60 --> 10398.94]  Probably.
[10399.04 --> 10400.12]  Yeah, there will be some.
[10400.12 --> 10403.68]  Didn't lose $2 billion in revenue because of account sharing.
[10404.12 --> 10405.42]  That was never their money.
[10405.92 --> 10406.84]  Anyway, merch messages.
[10407.44 --> 10413.28]  I've been loving my hat, and as a theater tech, I'm sure I'll get a lot of use from a blank black tee.
[10413.76 --> 10415.20]  Question for LLND.
[10415.86 --> 10418.66]  Did any of you guys see the northern lights last night?
[10418.66 --> 10419.14]  No.
[10419.14 --> 10419.82]  Uh, no.
[10420.00 --> 10420.14]  No.
[10420.14 --> 10423.48]  We had a solar event a little while ago.
[10424.08 --> 10425.60]  Like, I mean, a few months ago, I guess.
[10425.70 --> 10431.66]  I don't remember exactly when it was, but I saw people posting pictures of it, and I was like, wow, that looks really cool.
[10431.90 --> 10434.54]  And then I went and I looked at it in person, and I was like, oh.
[10435.00 --> 10440.74]  And I pointed my phone camera at it, and I was like, oh, wow, sure it looks a lot better in pictures.
[10440.86 --> 10443.96]  I probably could have just looked at this in pictures, and it actually would have been better.
[10443.96 --> 10449.82]  So that's kind of where I'm at on looking at the northern lights, at least this far south.
[10450.40 --> 10452.06]  This far south, it's like kind of a problem.
[10452.14 --> 10452.96]  They're usually kind of crap.
[10453.74 --> 10459.00]  If you're in places in Alberta and stuff, there's some pretty cool spots to catch it.
[10459.18 --> 10459.54]  But, yeah.
[10459.96 --> 10462.86]  I'm looking through this person's, like, personal blog, and they actually seem pretty cool.
[10463.04 --> 10466.04]  But I maintain that I don't think it can be properly measured.
[10467.88 --> 10468.24]  Okay.
[10469.74 --> 10473.18]  Yes, it can't be properly measured, but I also think it's naive.
[10473.18 --> 10477.02]  I believe to say that every person who pirated wasn't going to buy it.
[10477.08 --> 10477.60]  Oh, absolutely.
[10477.84 --> 10478.06]  Okay.
[10478.06 --> 10480.16]  You're definitely losing some amount.
[10480.74 --> 10480.90]  I think.
[10481.12 --> 10482.84]  20%, there's like no way.
[10482.90 --> 10485.20]  I think measuring it is basically impossible.
[10485.36 --> 10485.64]  Yes.
[10485.72 --> 10486.92]  I think we can agree on that.
[10487.24 --> 10487.44]  Yeah.
[10487.64 --> 10491.90]  I really don't think 20% is, that's got to be way too high.
[10492.54 --> 10495.76]  I don't even think 20% of gamers would know how to pirate it.
[10495.76 --> 10502.72]  That I don't know about, necessarily.
[10503.80 --> 10506.94]  And it's probably changed a lot over the years.
[10507.06 --> 10507.68]  That's why.
[10507.68 --> 10515.14]  Like, I would think 20% of PC gamers in the mid-2000s probably could figure out how to pirate a game.
[10515.22 --> 10515.52]  Yes.
[10515.76 --> 10516.16]  Now?
[10516.50 --> 10517.28]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10517.34 --> 10519.60]  And it could be very genre-dependent as well.
[10519.92 --> 10525.06]  Like, if you've got a game that, like, is super appealing to, like, tech heads and engineering sorts,
[10525.14 --> 10528.48]  you like a Kerbal Space program, or you have, like, a Satisfactory or something like that.
[10528.48 --> 10528.58]  Sure.
[10528.58 --> 10533.66]  I would say piracy is more of a threat than if you've got, like, a hyper-casual Fall Guys.
[10534.60 --> 10534.80]  You know?
[10536.12 --> 10538.12]  Assuming we don't need the online whatever.
[10538.20 --> 10538.54]  Yeah, online.
[10538.82 --> 10539.28]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[10539.36 --> 10540.56]  But, like, that type of a game.
[10540.92 --> 10541.22]  Yeah.
[10541.42 --> 10542.84]  Like, something more casual.
[10544.06 --> 10544.46]  Interesting.
[10545.08 --> 10545.34]  Okay.
[10545.64 --> 10546.30]  Let's move on.
[10546.56 --> 10547.86]  I don't feel like arguing about it.
[10548.14 --> 10553.00]  Why is it okay that NVIDIA locks down every setting and makes everything closed source,
[10553.16 --> 10555.12]  but it's a problem when Apple does the same thing?
[10555.12 --> 10558.86]  Do you see the value of Apple's walled garden as safer?
[10559.32 --> 10562.16]  When did I ever seem like I was super chill with NVIDIA's approach?
[10562.38 --> 10564.76]  Well, you've negatively pointed this out like a trillion times.
[10565.04 --> 10566.02]  And a lot of people do.
[10566.44 --> 10570.14]  People dunk on that constantly, especially when it comes to their Linux support.
[10570.36 --> 10574.30]  I have talked multiple times on this show.
[10574.48 --> 10581.76]  I'm going to say many times on this show about the fact that NVIDIA and Apple do not work together on anything.
[10582.64 --> 10584.24]  They do not work together at all.
[10584.24 --> 10585.20]  Do you know why?
[10585.86 --> 10592.74]  Because there is no room that is large enough to fit two penises that big.
[10594.04 --> 10597.96]  There's no room for them to swing them around, so they just don't do it.
[10600.56 --> 10601.36]  Won't work.
[10601.56 --> 10602.14]  Can't work.
[10603.12 --> 10603.70]  They used to.
[10604.16 --> 10606.24]  There used to be NVIDIA GPUs and MacBooks.
[10606.28 --> 10606.82]  Think about it.
[10607.42 --> 10608.00]  What happened?
[10608.00 --> 10610.00]  Bumpgate happened.
[10610.80 --> 10617.86]  And neither of them could admit any kind of failure to each other, to the public.
[10619.00 --> 10620.06]  And that was it.
[10620.52 --> 10623.24]  They never worked together again.
[10623.46 --> 10624.20]  It was that simple.
[10627.40 --> 10628.60]  Hello, Linus.
[10628.60 --> 10636.68]  They both have just a spectacularly arrogant way of doing business.
[10638.28 --> 10638.80]  Yeah.
[10638.90 --> 10641.20]  And no, it's not good when either of them does it.
[10641.30 --> 10643.84]  They're different in their approaches.
[10643.84 --> 10651.90]  I think Apple's is far more anti-consumer, like directly to their customers.
[10652.66 --> 10658.68]  But, I mean, I guess NVIDIA's is anti their purchasers of their equipment as well.
[10658.80 --> 10664.64]  It just manifests far more behind the scenes because you are not an NVIDIA customer.
[10664.64 --> 10668.72]  Ad-in board partners are NVIDIA customers.
[10669.02 --> 10672.30]  Solutions providers and system integrators are NVIDIA customers.
[10672.50 --> 10680.02]  And NVIDIA absolutely treats them with the exact same level of contempt that Apple does
[10680.02 --> 10680.60]  their customers.
[10680.72 --> 10681.68]  It's just way less visible.
[10683.44 --> 10684.18]  All right.
[10684.62 --> 10685.92]  Hello, Linus.
[10686.02 --> 10691.96]  When purchasing your Taycant, were you aware of its sibling, the Audi e-tron GT?
[10691.96 --> 10696.36]  It has real buttons inside and no Porsche tacks.
[10696.60 --> 10698.10]  Mechanically, they are nearly identical.
[10698.54 --> 10699.82]  I was aware of it.
[10699.94 --> 10701.46]  I didn't like it as much.
[10703.62 --> 10706.16]  Also, it's really expensive, too.
[10707.20 --> 10707.80]  What do you...
[10707.80 --> 10709.26]  I mean, it has an Audi tacks.
[10710.46 --> 10712.00]  So, right?
[10712.40 --> 10717.28]  No one at work drives an Audi, and I find that very reasonable.
[10718.94 --> 10719.42]  Okay.
[10719.42 --> 10720.72]  Where's even, like, the Locus?
[10721.30 --> 10721.70]  Locus?
[10722.12 --> 10725.16]  Where's the most local Audi dealership?
[10725.26 --> 10726.16]  Where's the closest one?
[10726.30 --> 10726.72]  I don't know.
[10726.80 --> 10727.26]  I mean, there's...
[10727.26 --> 10728.04]  They exist.
[10728.56 --> 10729.10]  I mean, there's definitely...
[10729.10 --> 10729.64]  Not even a used...
[10729.64 --> 10730.72]  I don't see very many...
[10730.72 --> 10731.90]  Not even a used Audi's.
[10732.18 --> 10734.64]  Yeah, I don't see very many Audi's in BC at all.
[10736.66 --> 10737.54]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10738.06 --> 10740.50]  Oh, no, it is quite a bit less expensive.
[10742.82 --> 10745.00]  I admittedly didn't look that close.
[10745.00 --> 10745.34]  Oh, okay.
[10745.40 --> 10745.92]  No, hold on.
[10745.96 --> 10746.16]  No, no.
[10746.16 --> 10748.18]  They just have a sort of different model for it.
[10748.18 --> 10752.42]  So, it only has one trim, but then you just add stuff to it.
[10752.46 --> 10753.14]  So, hold on a second.
[10753.22 --> 10757.44]  If you, like, add a bunch of, like, fancy crap to it, you can...
[10757.44 --> 10758.64]  Oh, you can definitely...
[10758.64 --> 10761.42]  You can definitely get her...
[10761.42 --> 10768.10]  Like, if you want heated rear seats and blah, blah, blah, fine Nappa leather, you can...
[10768.10 --> 10771.46]  Oh, no, actually, no, you cannot make it as expensive as a Taycan.
[10771.70 --> 10771.92]  Nope.
[10772.02 --> 10772.60]  Not even close.
[10773.30 --> 10774.00]  So, yeah, you're right.
[10774.02 --> 10774.40]  It's cheaper.
[10774.90 --> 10775.76]  I went to see it.
[10775.80 --> 10776.72]  I didn't really like it.
[10777.08 --> 10778.30]  And I think it's kind of that simple.
[10778.30 --> 10787.20]  First purchase as a full-time software engineer, gearing up for the home projects to come.
[10787.62 --> 10788.86]  Question for Linus.
[10789.02 --> 10792.16]  Are there any videos similar to the Intel Fab Tour in the pipeline?
[10793.48 --> 10794.18]  Fab Tour?
[10794.80 --> 10795.16]  Oh!
[10795.80 --> 10797.50]  Um, we're going to look at an ISP.
[10798.96 --> 10799.32]  Oh.
[10799.58 --> 10799.80]  Yeah.
[10799.92 --> 10800.50]  Well, that'll be sick.
[10801.06 --> 10801.76]  Yeah, that'll be fun.
[10801.84 --> 10802.58]  That's cool, actually.
[10802.72 --> 10803.18]  That's awesome.
[10803.34 --> 10805.50]  Yeah, and I think there's, like, uh...
[10805.50 --> 10807.26]  Oh, man, what is it again?
[10807.26 --> 10808.72]  No, it's, like, uh...
[10808.72 --> 10811.44]  It's really interesting for some reason.
[10812.26 --> 10813.56]  Uh, why is it interesting?
[10815.90 --> 10817.30]  Yeah, no, it's going to be really cool.
[10817.64 --> 10822.26]  I think it's an ISP or a data center or something, and I think it's, um...
[10822.26 --> 10825.78]  I don't want to say what it is exactly, but it's really cool.
[10825.94 --> 10828.48]  I forget, because I think I remember what it is, but I don't remember.
[10829.12 --> 10830.02]  If I think I...
[10830.02 --> 10830.82]  If I remember right.
[10833.46 --> 10836.74]  If it's what I think it is, it's going to be the coolest thing ever.
[10836.74 --> 10840.76]  And if it's just a random data center or ISP, then it's still going to be really cool.
[10841.60 --> 10841.84]  There.
[10844.38 --> 10848.16]  How do current-gen consoles use GDDR as system RAM?
[10848.34 --> 10853.84]  Why hasn't this been done on laptops or handheld gaming devices to increase integrated GPU memory bandwidth?
[10854.16 --> 10856.36]  That's a good question for an engineer.
[10856.36 --> 10860.36]  Um, I admit that I do not...
[10861.22 --> 10874.00]  I am not familiar enough with the differences between regular DDR and GDDR enough to tell you why it works fine for a console and why it doesn't work fine for a computer.
[10874.00 --> 10878.36]  Uh, my understanding, and there have been computers that do use GDDR memory.
[10878.36 --> 10880.64]  There was that weird, um...
[10880.64 --> 10886.18]  I forget the brand, but that weird, like, China-only console PC that did use GDDR.
[10886.42 --> 10899.30]  Uh, we've also seen, like, these bizarre, um, like, Frankenstein console boards that, uh, you can, like, install Windows on and stuff, and they are definitely using GDDR.
[10899.30 --> 10915.08]  Um, my understanding is it just comes down to that DDR has better latency, which is better for running an operating system, and GDDR has better bandwidth, excuse me, better bandwidth, which is better for graphics, where throughput is the most important thing.
[10915.52 --> 10926.30]  And these console operating systems are optimized so that they don't have as many sort of random processes running, so there's not as much of a hit from having higher latency.
[10926.30 --> 10928.58]  But beyond that, I couldn't tell you.
[10929.06 --> 10940.70]  And I, Diane, I have to admit, I don't really understand why, as we make our way into, you know, DDR6X, um, why the latency might not be good enough to use as your system memory as well.
[10940.76 --> 10947.22]  I mean, Apple is clearly using shared system memory, although, in that case, um, I, are they using, are they using HBM?
[10947.32 --> 10949.56]  I can't, I actually can't remember off the top of my head right now.
[10949.56 --> 10952.58]  Uh, M3 Mac memory type.
[10952.66 --> 10955.34]  No, I think it's just, is it DDR?
[10956.06 --> 10956.34]  Bleh!
[10956.78 --> 10957.88]  Why can't I remember right now?
[10958.46 --> 10958.86]  Help me.
[10960.48 --> 10961.62]  LP DDR5X.
[10961.66 --> 10963.78]  Yeah, okay, so it's, it's not GDDR.
[10964.24 --> 10972.92]  So, Apple clearly uses regular DDR as GPU memory, and consoles clearly use GDDR as system memory.
[10972.92 --> 10976.82]  Ask the engineers.
[10980.70 --> 10982.94]  Trying again, since we ran out of time last week.
[10983.12 --> 10986.66]  What is one regulation in your industry that you'd like to change or remove?
[10987.06 --> 10989.10]  And maybe one that you would like to add?
[10990.98 --> 10995.72]  In my industry, a regulation that I'd like to change or remove.
[10996.10 --> 10998.06]  I hate, I hate zoning regulations.
[10999.20 --> 11000.28]  I think they suck.
[11000.28 --> 11009.56]  I think that if you are, you know, building something tasteful and safe, and, um.
[11009.56 --> 11010.74]  I don't think all zoning sucks.
[11011.56 --> 11014.80]  Mixed residential business, mixed residential business.
[11014.84 --> 11020.14]  Yeah, but I don't necessarily want, like, uh, highly polluting factories in residential areas.
[11020.18 --> 11021.24]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[11021.48 --> 11022.68]  Not all zoning sucks.
[11022.74 --> 11024.74]  There's value to zoning, but I am, I'm.
[11024.74 --> 11026.26]  Most zoning, on the other hand.
[11026.94 --> 11027.24]  Yeah.
[11027.58 --> 11028.02]  Terrible.
[11028.16 --> 11028.48]  Downer.
[11028.48 --> 11028.84]  Downer.
[11028.84 --> 11029.20]  Okay.
[11029.20 --> 11034.80]  Uh, I think the one that I would want to get rid of is the, I don't remember what it is,
[11034.84 --> 11041.36]  but there's some type of claim or something that you can put on a YouTube video where you end up getting people's person identifiable information.
[11042.52 --> 11042.88]  Really?
[11043.02 --> 11044.00]  If you want to fight it.
[11045.44 --> 11045.80]  Oh.
[11046.40 --> 11046.72]  Yeah.
[11047.18 --> 11047.98]  That's pretty gross.
[11048.18 --> 11049.00]  Yeah, it's a problem.
[11049.00 --> 11063.90]  Like, I think some VTuber was going through this recently or something where, uh, people are putting some form of claim against their account, uh, because if they want to fight that claim, they have to give them their information and they don't want to be publicly identifiable.
[11063.90 --> 11066.36]  So they can't fight the whole reason why they're a VTuber.
[11066.74 --> 11068.16]  So they can't fight the claim.
[11068.44 --> 11069.50]  That's super icky.
[11069.50 --> 11070.52]  Yeah, it's gross.
[11071.72 --> 11076.78]  Um, I mean, even for us, like you don't necessarily want to give them personal information.
[11078.16 --> 11080.40]  Iron mouse and fake copyright claim to get personal info.
[11080.50 --> 11080.66]  Yeah.
[11081.02 --> 11081.28]  Yeah.
[11081.40 --> 11082.76]  Some article I was reading the other day.
[11082.76 --> 11085.22]  Yeah, it's gross.
[11086.12 --> 11086.68]  Don't do that.
[11087.36 --> 11087.78]  Be cool.
[11088.26 --> 11089.12]  Yeah, that's junkie.
[11089.80 --> 11091.10]  John Vellestep from Prairie.
[11091.42 --> 11094.68]  Does your interaction or relationship with Taryn change after hiring him?
[11094.92 --> 11098.80]  If Taryn's no longer working with LMG, where will you find a new CEO?
[11099.34 --> 11101.14]  Who will you trust for such a position?
[11102.04 --> 11107.48]  Um, no, I don't think that our relationship has changed much.
[11107.48 --> 11110.32]  We do periodic check-ins where I'm just like, hey, how you doing?
[11110.62 --> 11110.98]  You talk more often.
[11111.32 --> 11111.56]  Sorry?
[11111.56 --> 11112.70]  You talk more often.
[11112.80 --> 11114.46]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we talk more.
[11114.82 --> 11121.58]  Um, but like, I wouldn't say that the way we interact changes or has changed.
[11121.68 --> 11124.32]  He's still extremely brutally honest with me.
[11124.44 --> 11126.98]  I'm still extremely brutally honest with him.
[11127.46 --> 11129.24]  Uh, he made an offhand comment.
[11129.86 --> 11134.18]  Um, I sent a follow-up email a little while ago being like, yeah, I was kind of cranky when
[11134.18 --> 11134.62]  he said that.
[11134.64 --> 11139.88]  And he sends me this snarky ass response that was like, yeah, I can tell when you're sending
[11139.88 --> 11140.56]  emails.
[11140.56 --> 11142.14]  And I'm just like, yeah, okay.
[11142.20 --> 11143.12]  So we're good still.
[11147.82 --> 11149.80]  So yeah, it seems fine.
[11150.02 --> 11152.36]  Um, as for, you know, where would I find a new CEO?
[11152.46 --> 11153.68]  Who would I trust for such a position?
[11153.74 --> 11154.44]  I have no idea.
[11154.44 --> 11157.52]  I, um, I think he has pretty good job security at this point.
[11157.62 --> 11162.26]  Not because everything he does is perfect, but because, uh, you know, he has the room as
[11162.26 --> 11164.12]  far as, you know, I'm concerned still.
[11164.66 --> 11166.94]  Um, I, I don't agree with everything he does.
[11167.00 --> 11172.08]  I mean, I've talked about that a fair bit on the show recently, but I do support what he
[11172.08 --> 11172.42]  does.
[11172.42 --> 11174.64]  It's that we were talking about it earlier in the show, right?
[11175.48 --> 11178.78]  Um, I don't remember that not with, not about Terrence specifically.
[11179.34 --> 11181.64]  Um, but it was like the whole buy-in thing.
[11181.64 --> 11182.08]  Yeah.
[11182.20 --> 11184.08]  You don't necessarily have to agree, but we're on the same ship.
[11184.28 --> 11184.42]  Yeah.
[11184.58 --> 11184.96]  Yeah.
[11185.42 --> 11188.86]  Um, I, who would I trust?
[11188.90 --> 11196.32]  I mean, if he resigned, um, I'd probably have to step in until such time as we could find
[11196.32 --> 11196.84]  someone else.
[11196.84 --> 11198.94]  And I have no idea what that process would even look like.
[11199.00 --> 11204.58]  I have no experience hiring CEOs, um, other than just like, oh yeah, this guy was able
[11204.58 --> 11206.88]  to like deal with my at once.
[11206.96 --> 11208.28]  He should probably be able to do it again.
[11209.74 --> 11211.42]  That was the process last time.
[11211.50 --> 11212.20]  Yeah, I know.
[11217.24 --> 11220.18]  Hey guys at Luke as a 3d artist.
[11220.18 --> 11225.12]  I look for stretched textures in games to see if the developers put effort into their game.
[11225.12 --> 11229.80]  Does your profession help you in any way judge how good something is in games or otherwise?
[11230.06 --> 11237.62]  Dude, I have such a hard time enjoying certain forms of media now, especially YouTube.
[11239.18 --> 11245.24]  Because when I see something that is meant to look like a casual conversation between
[11245.24 --> 11245.70]  people.
[11245.78 --> 11248.16]  Oh, drives me nuts, dude.
[11248.16 --> 11252.96]  But I can tell that it was filmed from four different angles on three different days.
[11253.32 --> 11253.68]  Not gonna lie.
[11253.68 --> 11255.10]  I get this with you guys sometimes.
[11256.12 --> 11257.56]  We don't try to hide it, dude.
[11258.42 --> 11259.76]  That might be why.
[11260.04 --> 11260.18]  Yeah.
[11260.26 --> 11261.56]  We don't, we don't try to hide it.
[11261.58 --> 11265.74]  For a long time there, I don't even know if I could define the era, but you were making
[11265.74 --> 11270.18]  videos in a way that I think you didn't want to or something.
[11270.34 --> 11271.68]  I don't know how I would even define it.
[11271.80 --> 11272.98]  And I could tell.
[11273.42 --> 11277.06]  And I don't think like almost anyone else could tell, but I could tell it.
[11277.06 --> 11278.82]  And it honestly made them unwatchable.
[11278.82 --> 11283.70]  I couldn't watch any of it because I was just like, I know for a fact he doesn't want to
[11283.70 --> 11284.10]  do this.
[11284.64 --> 11286.68]  And that just, I don't know, that threw me off.
[11286.78 --> 11287.50]  I don't even remember.
[11288.10 --> 11296.32]  For me, it makes me a little bit more sympathetic to certain software issues and also significantly
[11296.32 --> 11298.08]  more critical about other ones.
[11298.96 --> 11299.46]  Because when like...
[11299.46 --> 11300.72]  You know how little work it was.
[11300.86 --> 11301.14]  Yeah.
[11301.56 --> 11302.14]  To do that better.
[11302.14 --> 11303.76]  Or I know that it was a decision.
[11304.38 --> 11304.68]  Right.
[11304.80 --> 11305.02]  Yep.
[11305.40 --> 11307.04]  And that'll drive me nuts too.
[11307.34 --> 11307.64]  Sure.
[11307.74 --> 11313.50]  Or I'll be able to tell, you know, like somebody just felt like not doing it.
[11313.58 --> 11317.18]  So they convinced someone else on the team or something that it like wasn't possible or
[11317.18 --> 11317.46]  whatever.
[11317.54 --> 11318.56]  And it's just like, oh man.
[11318.56 --> 11322.18]  I think part of what ruins stuff for me is the people that I'm surrounded with.
[11322.18 --> 11327.14]  Like Brandon Lee, who used to work here as a camera op, editor before that, mostly camera
[11327.14 --> 11327.38]  guy.
[11329.34 --> 11332.18]  So, you know, we're having like a cinematography discussion, right?
[11332.92 --> 11338.30]  And then it kind of shifts into like, there's, you know, and he's telling me like, look, like
[11338.30 --> 11341.56]  as a cinematographer, there's certain types of formats I just can't watch.
[11341.72 --> 11342.86]  And I was like, well, what do you mean?
[11342.88 --> 11343.60]  He's like sitcoms.
[11343.64 --> 11344.02]  I'm like, what?
[11344.48 --> 11345.48]  Why can't you watch a sitcom?
[11345.64 --> 11346.08]  Like, who cares?
[11346.16 --> 11347.06]  They make funny joke.
[11347.26 --> 11348.18]  Guy walks in room.
[11348.26 --> 11348.84]  Everyone laughs.
[11348.90 --> 11349.92]  You know, like all the tropes.
[11349.96 --> 11350.14]  Right.
[11350.14 --> 11355.10]  And he's like, the laugh track, actually, you know, on that side, anything with a laugh
[11355.10 --> 11356.68]  track, I can't, I can't watch it.
[11356.84 --> 11362.52]  And then he has me watch this, um, this edit of the Big Bang Theory without the laugh track.
[11362.78 --> 11364.82]  It's so rough, dude.
[11364.96 --> 11369.74]  It's, and that was, that was a show that at least the first few seasons I thought were,
[11369.92 --> 11370.84]  I thought were pretty funny.
[11371.28 --> 11374.40]  Um, they, it was, it was pretty light entertainment for me.
[11374.40 --> 11377.98]  Like it was the kind of thing that I would watch while like bouncing the baby to sleep.
[11377.98 --> 11381.96]  So it wasn't like, you know, my, my attention was super focused on it, but I enjoyed it.
[11382.48 --> 11387.30]  And, uh, and after that, I just, I, I couldn't look at it the same.
[11388.02 --> 11390.92]  I, I just, I couldn't enjoy it at all.
[11390.94 --> 11392.44]  Cause you know they're all standing there silently.
[11392.94 --> 11393.28]  Yeah.
[11395.14 --> 11395.54]  Completely.
[11395.70 --> 11400.30]  So, so part of it is just like the, it's, it's not necessarily working in the industry
[11400.30 --> 11404.36]  that ruins something for me, but it's like the, the, the professionals that I'm surrounded
[11404.36 --> 11407.12]  by and sort of their own, their influence.
[11407.64 --> 11411.02]  Um, yeah, totally ruined.
[11411.08 --> 11413.34]  I, I don't think I've watched a sitcom since then.
[11414.18 --> 11414.62]  Yeah.
[11415.44 --> 11415.70]  Yeah.
[11416.74 --> 11420.32]  I watched an edit of Death Note with all the inner monologues removed.
[11421.50 --> 11423.18]  That was awful.
[11425.18 --> 11426.16]  Just ridiculous.
[11426.16 --> 11430.68]  But yeah, there'll, there'll, there'll be like, I, I think honestly, if anything, it
[11430.68 --> 11432.62]  makes me appreciate my developers a lot.
[11433.58 --> 11439.78]  Cause I'll look at other sites and services, use it and then be like, uh, and then look
[11439.78 --> 11443.54]  up like how many developers does this company have and be like, whoa, okay.
[11443.66 --> 11444.80]  We're doing pretty good.
[11447.88 --> 11448.24]  Yeah.
[11448.40 --> 11448.98]  I don't know.
[11449.20 --> 11450.52]  Oh, teams, Microsoft teams.
[11450.74 --> 11454.50]  I always, I always give you a pat on the back when Luke is feeling bad.
[11454.50 --> 11459.40]  Oh, helps cheer him up a little bit or makes you hate teams more.
[11459.48 --> 11460.30]  I don't know which one it is.
[11460.44 --> 11465.64]  Why, why does it not highlight your box when you are talking in a call?
[11466.86 --> 11469.08]  Why are you making everyone go, is my mic working?
[11469.20 --> 11472.76]  You should be able to tell cause it should highlight just like it does for everyone else.
[11473.08 --> 11476.70]  That is the worst feature decision in the world.
[11476.94 --> 11480.66]  Why can't I schedule a message to a group chat that I just created?
[11480.66 --> 11481.78]  Why can't I do that?
[11482.18 --> 11483.30]  Why is that a limitation?
[11483.30 --> 11485.82]  Why does that possibly exist?
[11486.40 --> 11487.14]  You could make an argument.
[11487.14 --> 11489.22]  I could do that in everything else that has scheduled messages.
[11489.22 --> 11492.36]  If this was a free app, you could make an argument that it's an anti-spam feature.
[11492.36 --> 11493.38]  But Discord's better!
[11494.14 --> 11495.90]  But teams is a paid app.
[11496.96 --> 11498.90]  Teams for the workplace is a paid app.
[11500.08 --> 11504.34]  Nobody is joining an organization to create groups and spam it.
[11504.34 --> 11507.64]  And if they are, then that organization has some shit to figure out.
[11507.96 --> 11516.78]  As I regain control, I would like to reiterate that Microsoft, if you have any interest, I would be very happy to consult on making teams better.
[11516.92 --> 11518.14]  I will do it for free.
[11519.00 --> 11520.96]  I might have an in on that.
[11520.96 --> 11522.00]  I'll see what I can do.
[11522.00 --> 11524.24]  We might not even keep using teams.
[11525.18 --> 11533.66]  And even if we stop using teams, in the hopes of making it better for all of the rest of the people in the world that have to use your app,
[11534.02 --> 11537.54]  I would love to consult for free on making it better.
[11537.80 --> 11546.18]  There are objective and incredibly easy things that you can do that would make it a way better experience for literally everyone.
[11546.18 --> 11547.58]  Cool.
[11548.06 --> 11548.48]  Nice.
[11550.26 --> 11550.66]  Nice.
[11551.16 --> 11552.84]  So many people have to use your software.
[11554.50 --> 11558.34]  For Luke, imagine you're hired as an AI researcher.
[11558.78 --> 11563.06]  Once you sign an NDA, they show you an incredible human-like AGI.
[11563.60 --> 11565.62]  Or maybe they're just hazing you.
[11565.92 --> 11568.26]  What's the craziest advance you'd believe?
[11569.88 --> 11572.46]  What's the craziest advance I would believe?
[11572.46 --> 11579.14]  Like craziest level that they had gotten to that had been hidden from the public and I'm now told?
[11579.32 --> 11579.86]  Is that what they mean?
[11580.04 --> 11580.70]  Yeah, let's get that.
[11580.88 --> 11581.02]  Yeah.
[11581.56 --> 11582.58]  I think that's exactly.
[11585.18 --> 11587.76]  I think an advancement on what we currently have.
[11587.88 --> 11589.78]  I would not believe AGI.
[11590.08 --> 11597.98]  I would be, you know, the first time I ever saw a mineral oil computer, I traced the monitor cable to the monitor because I didn't believe it.
[11597.98 --> 11602.40]  But I would be doing stuff like that, you know, trying to figure out what are you doing?
[11602.52 --> 11605.38]  Is there a person in the box of this Mechanical Turk?
[11606.68 --> 11612.60]  But if it was like a, you know, the tasking thing that they have now?
[11613.20 --> 11621.46]  If they had a version of that that was just like very unrestrained, didn't have token limits, stuff like that, was able to pull on resources way more heavily.
[11621.46 --> 11622.80]  I would believe that.
[11623.20 --> 11631.20]  I think the, the greatest, I wasn't asked, but I think the, the best advance that I'd believe is near real time latency.
[11631.64 --> 11638.42]  Cause right now that's a, that's a huge, like, I think that's a huge impediment to making these things believable.
[11638.62 --> 11639.20]  The tasking one?
[11639.20 --> 11641.52]  How long everything takes to respond.
[11641.52 --> 11647.20]  Like it makes the, it's not, okay.
[11647.96 --> 11652.42]  Think back to when we were hosting the WAN show remotely during COVID.
[11652.76 --> 11653.48]  Oh, I see.
[11653.76 --> 11662.74]  Even just the, the, you know, 40 milliseconds of a video call, 50 milliseconds of a video call is enough that our interaction is not natural.
[11662.74 --> 11670.18]  Is it fair if it uses some form of like filler or if it reframes partway through in the same way that humans do?
[11670.36 --> 11670.44]  Yeah.
[11670.44 --> 11672.68]  Like what if it, what if it does stuff like that?
[11672.70 --> 11680.40]  That's the best that I could believe right now is if they could nail down the latency, but it would still like say weird stuff and hallucinate and stuff.
[11680.46 --> 11683.62]  Like, I don't think we're, I don't think we're close to fixing that.
[11686.56 --> 11692.06]  I was wondering why all of the underwear are out of stock and say they're not coming back.
[11692.06 --> 11696.22]  Does this mean you guys are getting out of the underwear business or is it something new is coming?
[11697.10 --> 11699.60]  We have issues with our supplier yet again.
[11700.44 --> 11704.34]  At what point do you become the supplier?
[11704.86 --> 11708.44]  We can't, I mean, we can't, we're not a like fabric mill.
[11709.44 --> 11711.34]  No, it's an answer.
[11711.74 --> 11714.96]  I bet we could make textiles.
[11714.96 --> 11716.16]  I'm just drawing.
[11716.16 --> 11716.20]  I'm just drawing.
[11716.84 --> 11717.24]  Chill.
[11718.92 --> 11719.64]  Build it.
[11720.42 --> 11720.76]  Yeah.
[11721.42 --> 11722.50]  No, don't do that.
[11722.74 --> 11724.48]  No, no, we don't.
[11724.58 --> 11724.78]  We don't.
[11724.90 --> 11725.34]  It's going to happen.
[11725.42 --> 11729.22]  Sometimes we just, we're having a surprising amount of them at the moment, but like, I don't know.
[11729.68 --> 11730.06]  It's fine.
[11730.06 --> 11733.86]  Thanks, Tynan.
[11733.86 --> 11733.96]  Tynan.
[11740.96 --> 11744.38]  Tynan from the creator where I was team up in float plane chat here.
[11748.16 --> 11749.36]  No isn't an answer.
[11749.48 --> 11749.96]  Holy moly.
[11750.06 --> 11750.94]  Luke, well played.
[11750.94 --> 11753.96]  We're going to find a solution.
[11754.10 --> 11756.96]  It just isn't going to be to become a textile mill.
[11757.06 --> 11757.60]  That's all.
[11759.60 --> 11761.12]  And it will take some time.
[11762.68 --> 11763.12]  Yeah.
[11763.24 --> 11766.70]  We're not dependent on our ability to produce and sell underwear.
[11766.90 --> 11767.76]  So we'll be fine.
[11767.88 --> 11768.90]  We have time.
[11770.48 --> 11770.92]  Okay.
[11771.30 --> 11772.94]  You could just buy shirts and cut them up.
[11772.94 --> 11777.24]  The more, the more tall shirts you buy, the better it looks.
[11777.40 --> 11778.76]  So turn those into underwear.
[11778.98 --> 11779.22]  Yeah.
[11779.26 --> 11780.10]  Not a bad solution.
[11780.20 --> 11780.94]  Not a bad solution.
[11781.24 --> 11781.46]  Yeah.
[11781.94 --> 11782.34]  Okay.
[11783.06 --> 11783.62]  Oh man.
[11783.70 --> 11785.78]  I even know what the name of the company could be.
[11786.64 --> 11786.96]  LTT.
[11789.28 --> 11790.04]  Textile tips.
[11790.24 --> 11790.44]  Yeah.
[11790.68 --> 11791.04]  Nice.
[11792.72 --> 11793.06]  Nice.
[11793.18 --> 11794.64]  Another domain that starts with lines.
[11794.76 --> 11795.60]  I'm just trying to help you out.
[11795.60 --> 11796.12]  It's good.
[11796.20 --> 11796.56]  Thank you.
[11796.62 --> 11796.78]  Yeah.
[11796.78 --> 11798.06]  We need to own all of them.
[11798.06 --> 11803.26]  I actually have a problem because I often use shorthand to get to domains.
[11803.48 --> 11803.64]  Nice.
[11803.76 --> 11805.18]  So like Gmail, right?
[11805.48 --> 11806.46]  I'm not typing Gmail.
[11806.66 --> 11807.74]  Just GM enter.
[11807.98 --> 11808.20]  Yeah.
[11808.88 --> 11809.94]  I can't do that.
[11810.04 --> 11810.26]  No.
[11810.54 --> 11811.38]  With ours.
[11811.94 --> 11813.16]  It drives me crazy.
[11813.34 --> 11815.60]  Just set up our shortener.
[11815.96 --> 11816.80]  Our LMG.GG.
[11817.14 --> 11818.60]  Just give myself some.
[11818.60 --> 11819.32]  Give myself some.
[11820.38 --> 11821.24]  Add affiliate.
[11821.24 --> 11821.42]  Lab.
[11821.68 --> 11822.02]  Store.
[11822.82 --> 11823.68]  Add affiliate links.
[11824.00 --> 11824.30]  Forum.
[11824.68 --> 11828.04]  I mean, your team controls like our DNS settings and everything.
[11828.34 --> 11832.06]  So you could just add some like custom resolving rules and just.
[11832.54 --> 11832.80]  Oh yeah.
[11832.80 --> 11833.94]  We could do that for the whole company.
[11834.08 --> 11834.26]  Yeah.
[11834.38 --> 11835.18]  If you just typed it.
[11835.32 --> 11837.86]  If you just like typed FP into a browser bar.
[11838.02 --> 11838.14]  You could.
[11838.52 --> 11839.80]  I will do that right now.
[11841.10 --> 11843.40]  This just sounds like you're not trying hard enough to solve it.
[11843.58 --> 11845.50]  I tried to say no was the answer.
[11845.58 --> 11846.22]  That's my bad.
[11846.30 --> 11846.52]  Yep.
[11846.66 --> 11846.88]  Yep.
[11846.88 --> 11847.48]  Way to go.
[11847.70 --> 11847.94]  Oops.
[11848.12 --> 11849.38]  This is not how you lead, Luke.
[11852.82 --> 11854.58]  Your team is looking down on you.
[11854.68 --> 11855.64]  I got work to do.
[11855.78 --> 11856.92]  Hi LDL.
[11857.00 --> 11858.02]  How's the bike painting?
[11858.06 --> 11858.42]  Coming.
[11858.70 --> 11861.22]  I'm interested in doing a custom paint job on my car hood.
[11861.48 --> 11864.34]  Do you have any tips for someone getting into auto body painting game?
[11864.66 --> 11866.34]  Into the audio body game.
[11867.42 --> 11868.40]  Car paint.
[11871.30 --> 11871.78]  Don't.
[11873.14 --> 11877.44]  Unless you have many, many hours and many hundreds of dollars to invest in it.
[11877.50 --> 11878.16]  Just stay out.
[11880.54 --> 11881.40]  So close.
[11882.08 --> 11883.10]  I lost it at the end.
[11883.10 --> 11883.54]  I'm sorry.
[11885.60 --> 11888.56]  When is the last time you bought your wife flowers, Linus?
[11889.56 --> 11889.96]  What?
[11890.26 --> 11893.76]  She always tells me that they're not good use of money.
[11894.46 --> 11895.94]  She is the perfect woman.
[11896.94 --> 11897.80]  Lego flowers.
[11897.88 --> 11898.98]  She likes the Lego flowers, I think.
[11899.06 --> 11900.12]  She does like Lego flowers.
[11900.20 --> 11900.32]  Yeah.
[11900.32 --> 11904.86]  Last time I bought my wife flowers.
[11906.60 --> 11907.40]  I'm trying to think.
[11907.78 --> 11910.02]  I bought her something random.
[11910.14 --> 11911.02]  She likes O'Henry bars.
[11911.14 --> 11912.76]  I got her an O'Henry bar a couple weeks ago.
[11912.76 --> 11915.40]  That's what she likes.
[11915.48 --> 11915.98]  What did you?
[11916.58 --> 11918.80]  No, I wasn't smiling because I thought it was like.
[11918.80 --> 11922.98]  Rule number one is actually listen and actually get them what they actually like.
[11923.10 --> 11923.90]  That's rule number one.
[11924.10 --> 11924.28]  Yeah.
[11926.28 --> 11928.12]  I was smiling because it was cute, not because it was bad.
[11928.18 --> 11929.06]  Yeah, it was adorable.
[11930.16 --> 11934.42]  Linus, when you could start driving, what safety measures and rules will you implement?
[11935.18 --> 11936.68]  Android Auto CarPlay only.
[11936.88 --> 11939.62]  New car with loads of smart safety features or an old clunker?
[11939.82 --> 11941.64]  Does little man get to drive the Porsche?
[11941.64 --> 11942.88]  No, absolutely not.
[11943.38 --> 11944.58]  Yeah, you got to be kidding me.
[11944.76 --> 11944.94]  Ever?
[11945.02 --> 11949.10]  The first thing I did when I started driving was I like hit a pillar in a parking lot.
[11949.26 --> 11949.56]  Like there's.
[11950.96 --> 11952.30]  Yeah, there's no way.
[11952.94 --> 11954.16]  I've never hit anything yet.
[11954.40 --> 11955.24]  No, I think if he has.
[11955.32 --> 11958.10]  I think if he has a big date, then I don't see why not.
[11959.22 --> 11960.56]  But like the flip side of it is.
[11960.56 --> 11962.46]  You got to prove some responsible driving before then.
[11962.56 --> 11962.74]  Yeah.
[11962.82 --> 11967.68]  And the flip side of it is like if she's the kind of girl who's impressed by that,
[11968.54 --> 11970.52]  is she the kind of girl that.
[11970.52 --> 11971.74]  That you want around.
[11972.16 --> 11973.08]  Likes you for you.
[11973.30 --> 11973.58]  Yeah.
[11973.82 --> 11974.14]  You know?
[11974.32 --> 11974.58]  Yeah.
[11974.84 --> 11976.96]  So I don't know.
[11977.28 --> 11981.58]  And like, and it's one of those things that's like, do I want to encourage, you know, putting
[11981.58 --> 11982.12]  on airs?
[11982.18 --> 11982.82]  That's not his car.
[11982.82 --> 11987.80]  I wouldn't tell him not to rent a nice car to impress a girl.
[11987.94 --> 11991.68]  But borrowing your dad's car is not like you haven't actually done anything.
[11992.68 --> 11993.08]  Really?
[11993.16 --> 11993.46]  You wouldn't?
[11993.52 --> 11994.22]  I'm actually surprised.
[11994.96 --> 11997.20]  You wouldn't tell him not to rent a nice car to impress a girl.
[11997.68 --> 11999.56]  That does not seem like a Linus-ism actually.
[12000.56 --> 12000.96]  I.
[12001.58 --> 12001.96]  Okay.
[12002.06 --> 12004.04]  I wouldn't not allow it, I guess.
[12004.16 --> 12004.84]  Like it, like it.
[12004.84 --> 12006.18]  And it's not up to me anyway.
[12006.42 --> 12006.66]  Yeah.
[12006.92 --> 12007.18]  Right.
[12007.18 --> 12013.10]  Like, um, and remember rent a nice car to impress a girl can mean rent a limo for a
[12013.10 --> 12013.36]  prom.
[12013.92 --> 12015.24]  That's renting a nice car.
[12015.38 --> 12015.70]  Okay.
[12015.94 --> 12016.74]  Might impress her.
[12016.82 --> 12022.34]  Like, I'm just, I'm just saying there's, there's context where him actually doing something.
[12022.40 --> 12024.50]  Cause remember the thing that's impressive is the effort.
[12024.98 --> 12025.44]  Right.
[12025.44 --> 12030.10]  And so if you're trying to impress her with your effort, which is the thing that I would
[12030.10 --> 12031.84]  hope she would be valuing about it.
[12031.92 --> 12032.34]  Right.
[12032.38 --> 12034.34]  Because we aren't all just materialistic here.
[12034.74 --> 12039.70]  Um, then you have to actually put in the effort and be like, Hey dad, can I have the keys?
[12040.08 --> 12040.90]  Is not effort.
[12041.38 --> 12043.68]  So I would never say don't make an effort.
[12044.38 --> 12044.82]  Yeah.
[12045.40 --> 12047.60]  But borrowing my car isn't effort.
[12047.82 --> 12048.08]  Yeah.
[12048.58 --> 12053.44]  Working hard and mowing lawns and renting a cool car for a day is effort.
[12053.44 --> 12056.30]  And he had to do those things in order to borrow your car.
[12057.50 --> 12063.14]  Um, but then maybe he could get a cooler car by my car.
[12064.82 --> 12065.48]  I don't know.
[12066.32 --> 12067.84]  Or maybe, yeah, I don't know.
[12067.88 --> 12069.48]  It just seems, it just seems lame.
[12069.62 --> 12070.18]  It seems lame.
[12071.36 --> 12075.32]  I have so many additional questions I want to ask, but they're information that should
[12075.32 --> 12076.30]  not end up on the stream.
[12076.40 --> 12077.42]  So I'm going to leave it there.
[12077.68 --> 12083.42]  Like how long until this is going to be a thing and stuff like that, which we shouldn't
[12083.42 --> 12083.86]  go into.
[12084.70 --> 12086.00]  Until what's going to be a thing?
[12087.32 --> 12088.08]  He's driving.
[12088.66 --> 12090.18]  Oh, I mean, a while.
[12090.60 --> 12093.92]  Like I would expect him to get his license right when he is of age.
[12094.60 --> 12096.64]  That's apparently not a thing anymore.
[12096.86 --> 12097.58]  Have you heard about that?
[12098.52 --> 12099.34]  That's interesting.
[12099.34 --> 12101.48]  I have some pretty strong feelings about that.
[12101.48 --> 12101.80]  Yeah.
[12101.94 --> 12102.94]  That might not be popular.
[12102.94 --> 12109.28]  Um, I, I see driving as a fundamental life skill.
[12109.94 --> 12116.66]  Um, I, I see it as being just an important part of being a competent adult.
[12116.66 --> 12119.30]  Your insurance gets cheaper the longer you have your license.
[12119.30 --> 12123.00]  I was so scared that we would have, uh, differing opinions.
[12123.50 --> 12126.54]  Oh, I thought you were going to take the, nah, driving's not necessary.
[12126.54 --> 12127.98]  And I would have just left.
[12130.20 --> 12131.20]  All the goodwill.
[12133.20 --> 12133.64]  Okay.
[12133.80 --> 12134.00]  Goodbye.
[12134.00 --> 12139.38]  And there's a lot of places in the world where you might never use the skill or certainly
[12139.38 --> 12140.02]  not often.
[12140.28 --> 12142.46]  But just in case you do, your insurance is super cheap.
[12142.54 --> 12146.50]  Look, I don't agree with my mother about everything, but you know, when she was, when
[12146.50 --> 12151.46]  she was convincing me to learn to drive stick, um, and I don't necessarily think that most
[12151.46 --> 12153.10]  people need to learn stick anymore.
[12153.22 --> 12157.86]  There were a lot more stick shift cars back in the early 2000s and 2000s than there are
[12157.86 --> 12158.16]  today.
[12158.16 --> 12162.68]  Uh, but when she was convincing me that I needed to learn to drive stick, a manual transmission
[12162.68 --> 12169.56]  with the shifter, um, her rationale for it was, you don't know where you're going to be
[12169.56 --> 12173.00]  and what the situation is going to be when there's an emergency.
[12174.16 --> 12180.86]  If the driver is incapacitated for some reason, and we need to get to the hospital now, you
[12180.86 --> 12181.94]  need to be able to drive.
[12182.24 --> 12184.86]  You need to be able to drive any vehicle and you need to be ready for it.
[12184.86 --> 12189.14]  You don't need to be the most practiced operator of the thing, but you damn well need to know
[12189.14 --> 12189.66]  how to do it.
[12190.16 --> 12192.56]  And, um, I kind of carried that with me.
[12192.64 --> 12193.76]  I, I agree.
[12194.10 --> 12195.20]  I strongly agree.
[12195.86 --> 12202.22]  Um, and I think that even if you will probably never drive, you should learn to drive.
[12203.02 --> 12203.42]  Yeah.
[12203.84 --> 12208.36]  Uh, vertig one said being able to drive isn't the same thing as having a license.
[12208.50 --> 12214.14]  I do agree with that, but I don't think at least here getting a license is not that big
[12214.14 --> 12218.32]  of a step and the potential benefits behind it are really big.
[12218.62 --> 12223.20]  Like, Oh, if you do need a car for whatever reason, uh, your insurance is way cheaper.
[12223.30 --> 12227.86]  The ability to upgrade your license in case you need to have an upgraded license for a
[12227.86 --> 12229.56]  certain line of work that you might need to do.
[12229.56 --> 12229.92]  Yeah.
[12230.02 --> 12232.66]  It opens up so many work possibilities.
[12233.04 --> 12237.30]  Keeping yourself limited in that way and making it so that if you do need it, it's going to be
[12237.30 --> 12242.80]  very expensive, um, just seems really oddly short-sighted for something that is not that
[12242.80 --> 12243.50]  big of a barrier.
[12243.82 --> 12246.02]  Are you always going to live in a super walkable city?
[12246.14 --> 12247.30]  Maybe you want to move.
[12247.38 --> 12247.92]  I don't know.
[12247.96 --> 12248.14]  Yeah.
[12248.20 --> 12249.34]  It's, it's the arguments.
[12249.48 --> 12251.64]  Look at the cost of housing and stuff lately.
[12251.64 --> 12253.98]  Like you're probably going to move at some point.
[12253.98 --> 12258.12]  And it's one of those things where not, not everybody is in a life situation where they're
[12258.12 --> 12258.80]  able to.
[12259.28 --> 12259.68]  Yeah.
[12260.12 --> 12261.54]  And the barrier might be too high.
[12261.64 --> 12262.82]  And the barrier might be too high.
[12262.92 --> 12264.26]  They may not have access to a vehicle.
[12264.36 --> 12265.58]  They might not have someone to teach them.
[12265.58 --> 12266.84]  They might have a physical disability.
[12267.04 --> 12267.86]  I don't know.
[12267.92 --> 12269.32]  Everyone's life situation is different.
[12269.32 --> 12269.84]  But if the opportunity is there.
[12270.06 --> 12275.96]  But if you have the opportunity and you're just like, I disagree.
[12278.60 --> 12279.00]  Yeah.
[12279.60 --> 12280.00]  Yeah.
[12280.56 --> 12285.38]  Like I knew people that didn't have access to a vehicle in order to take their test.
[12285.46 --> 12286.86]  And that was a pretty big barrier.
[12287.28 --> 12290.94]  Some of them still got over it by like, you know, paying a friend to borrow theirs, which
[12290.94 --> 12292.98]  is kind of sketchy to be clear.
[12293.08 --> 12293.34]  Oh yeah.
[12293.34 --> 12293.38]  Yeah.
[12294.14 --> 12296.46]  Or, or other various options.
[12296.60 --> 12300.78]  I think there's also places where you can, you can rent a car, but then renting a car
[12300.78 --> 12301.60]  is really expensive.
[12302.52 --> 12306.12]  And I think it's, as far as my understanding goes, it's even more expensive when you're
[12306.12 --> 12307.24]  renting it for that reason.
[12308.62 --> 12313.46]  There's like, there's lots of different reasons why it might not make sense, but the dip in people
[12313.46 --> 12318.62]  getting their licenses does not match those reasons being more legitimate.
[12318.78 --> 12319.20]  You know what I mean?
[12319.20 --> 12321.16]  Like that, it doesn't follow that line.
[12321.56 --> 12321.68]  So.
[12322.38 --> 12322.90]  Arbiter K.
[12322.96 --> 12326.62]  I don't know if this is true, but Arbiter K says Gavin Free of slow-mo guy's fame is
[12326.62 --> 12328.42]  in his thirties and does not have a driver's license.
[12328.42 --> 12329.84]  That actually blows my mind.
[12329.84 --> 12340.84]  And I will say that Gavin, who I have met, is in a life situation where he doesn't need
[12340.84 --> 12341.88]  to drive himself anywhere.
[12342.14 --> 12343.16]  So that's something.
[12344.30 --> 12345.32]  You are not.
[12345.32 --> 12348.68]  Just get it.
[12348.68 --> 12349.26]  Just get it.
[12349.60 --> 12350.56]  Just get it.
[12351.60 --> 12352.56]  Oh my goodness.
[12352.90 --> 12355.34]  That's, uh, I don't know if that's true anyway, though.
[12356.30 --> 12359.36]  UK licensing is, it's a very hard test.
[12359.76 --> 12360.32]  Oh yeah?
[12360.86 --> 12362.32]  We would be put to shame.
[12363.14 --> 12364.62]  I mean, that's not too surprising.
[12366.22 --> 12367.14]  Uh, hello, hello.
[12367.34 --> 12371.22]  Oh, and to be clear, there's lots of cities that I wouldn't drive in, even though I do know
[12371.22 --> 12371.74]  how to drive.
[12371.74 --> 12374.40]  Like there's, there's places I've been that I'm just like, this is terrifying.
[12374.64 --> 12374.94]  This is crazy.
[12375.16 --> 12375.40]  Yep.
[12376.28 --> 12377.68]  So there's that as well.
[12377.92 --> 12381.56]  There's also places where like, if you have an international driver's license, you're allowed
[12381.56 --> 12385.86]  to drive, but like the road laws are so different that you just probably shouldn't.
[12386.14 --> 12386.24]  Yeah.
[12386.36 --> 12386.52]  Yeah.
[12386.76 --> 12387.00]  Yeah.
[12387.02 --> 12393.20]  I wouldn't even consider driving in like, uh, an, uh, a metropolitan city and like India.
[12393.54 --> 12393.90]  Yeah.
[12394.02 --> 12396.50]  I wouldn't even begin to consider it.
[12396.50 --> 12401.12]  Not, not even the rules of the road, just the styles of driving are so different.
[12401.12 --> 12401.66]  So different.
[12401.90 --> 12402.58]  My goodness.
[12403.92 --> 12404.14]  Yeah.
[12405.10 --> 12405.86]  Hello, LLD.
[12406.12 --> 12411.36]  I'm a power sports student who was told to buy a quality ratcheting screwdriver.
[12412.34 --> 12413.14]  Power sports?
[12413.54 --> 12414.68]  Uh, motorsports.
[12415.04 --> 12415.22]  Okay.
[12416.02 --> 12416.30]  Yeah.
[12417.00 --> 12421.18]  Uh, Linus, has there been any consideration towards motorcycle riding when designing any
[12421.18 --> 12422.06]  products on the store?
[12422.06 --> 12424.12]  I'd say the only one is the backpack.
[12424.68 --> 12430.24]  And the only consideration really was that it would fit over like my shoulder pads.
[12430.24 --> 12438.84]  Um, on my riding jacket and that, uh, the carabiner zipper pulls were because a, I thought they
[12438.84 --> 12439.34]  were kind of cool.
[12439.42 --> 12440.92]  I saw them somewhere and I thought they were cool.
[12440.92 --> 12446.68]  And B, because I, uh, would ride with my rackets, my badminton racket sticking out of the bag.
[12446.68 --> 12451.20]  And so I needed a zipper system that would hold, but not come apart.
[12451.48 --> 12451.58]  Yeah.
[12451.76 --> 12453.98]  Um, but hold, but not close completely.
[12453.98 --> 12455.98]  Um, yeah.
[12458.38 --> 12459.26]  That's about it.
[12459.58 --> 12461.72]  Good evening, Daniel, Lucas, and Sebastian.
[12462.26 --> 12465.88]  I'm looking to get into swimming as my exercise routine.
[12465.96 --> 12466.64]  It's not my name.
[12467.46 --> 12467.96]  Oh, it is now.
[12467.96 --> 12468.46]  Sorry, keep going.
[12468.88 --> 12473.08]  Curious as to how that is going for you and any tips on getting started.
[12473.08 --> 12475.58]  Um, it was great this summer.
[12475.66 --> 12479.40]  Like I actually like got boobs and my cardio is way better.
[12479.74 --> 12483.88]  Um, I've switched over to Beat Saber now that the weather sucks and I am looking forward
[12483.88 --> 12486.48]  to swimming again, um, next year.
[12487.44 --> 12490.06]  The only tip I can give you is do it.
[12490.14 --> 12490.64]  You coward.
[12491.14 --> 12495.04]  Uh, it's, it's so hard to get motivated to get to the pool.
[12495.04 --> 12500.24]  Even when it's in my backyard, it's still hard to like go get changed and like get in
[12500.24 --> 12504.56]  the water, but once you get going, it's, um, it's good.
[12504.86 --> 12507.32]  The relatively long drive to my gym sucks.
[12507.80 --> 12512.76]  Um, but the gym that's closer to my house is way overpopulated to the point where if I
[12512.76 --> 12517.80]  wanted to do the same workout that I do at the gym that I go to, it would take, uh, sometimes
[12517.80 --> 12522.22]  up to four times as long to the point where in a three hour period, I might not be able
[12522.22 --> 12527.40]  to get enough time on each one of the machines to even finish my workout that I can do in an
[12527.40 --> 12528.14]  hour at the other gym.
[12528.38 --> 12528.82]  That's frustrating.
[12529.00 --> 12529.52]  It's not even worth it.
[12529.56 --> 12530.00]  I have to drive.
[12530.56 --> 12534.96]  Um, the other thing I would say is if you don't want to pull a me and get an ear infection,
[12534.96 --> 12538.08]  if you're going to be swimming all the time, maybe get earplugs or something.
[12539.18 --> 12540.20]  They're pretty cheap.
[12540.70 --> 12545.84]  I bought some like Nike ones and they were like $9 or something, $10, $12, somewhere around
[12545.84 --> 12546.02]  there.
[12547.74 --> 12549.02]  Last one I've got for you today.
[12549.34 --> 12549.78]  Hi, DLL.
[12550.04 --> 12552.32]  What features are in the works for float plane?
[12552.48 --> 12554.90]  And are there any features that you would like to implement?
[12555.20 --> 12558.28]  What kinds of things does the team do for the other companies?
[12558.28 --> 12560.18]  That's a lot of questions.
[12560.32 --> 12560.62]  Whoa.
[12561.28 --> 12569.44]  Uh, could you give us a product roadmap and, uh, also a business proposal for the quarter
[12569.44 --> 12573.88]  Q, a quarterly business review for what the, what's your Q5 looking like?
[12573.88 --> 12575.92]  Oh yeah.
[12576.04 --> 12580.54]  Honestly, each one of those I could make a whole show about.
[12580.80 --> 12582.16]  Um, wow.
[12582.26 --> 12588.26]  The roadmap I'm not giving you, um, because I have learned my lesson on that.
[12588.26 --> 12594.44]  And if we make any change of decision or do anything whatsoever to alter it, you'll say
[12594.44 --> 12595.18]  you won't be mad.
[12596.34 --> 12598.54]  People will go freaking nuclear.
[12598.80 --> 12602.24]  Uh, we're working on stuff and it's good.
[12602.48 --> 12602.92]  Yep.
[12602.92 --> 12605.96]  And people are going to be happy and it is what it is.
[12606.04 --> 12611.92]  We don't have like, you know, the, the agility or the speed that some notably larger teams
[12611.92 --> 12612.46]  have.
[12612.54 --> 12616.32]  We don't have feature parody with things like YouTube and Twitch and stuff like that.
[12616.44 --> 12617.84]  And that just is what it is.
[12617.88 --> 12620.54]  We don't have the, the developer base.
[12620.84 --> 12623.72]  We don't have the armies of developers to do stuff like that.
[12623.72 --> 12624.28]  And that's okay.
[12624.28 --> 12626.90]  We still have cool things.
[12626.90 --> 12632.88]  Uh, I think full plane is, is good and we're going to keep doing good stuff and it does
[12632.88 --> 12639.64]  feel like over time we are trending to getting closer to them, which I find interesting, um,
[12639.68 --> 12640.46]  and cool.
[12640.46 --> 12642.56]  So it's getting, it's getting better over time, which is good.
[12642.66 --> 12647.78]  So I'll say that, uh, in regards to other things that the team does, um, that has slowly
[12647.78 --> 12651.14]  shifted into more dedicated positions than it originally was.
[12651.14 --> 12655.50]  So you have people like, uh, Conrad doing things for, uh, LTT store.
[12655.50 --> 12659.44]  Technically the float plane team encompasses the labs web team.
[12659.56 --> 12662.20]  So the labs website is technically on the float plane team.
[12662.58 --> 12669.36]  Um, Oh, did we ever talk about the changes to LTC labs on the, uh, on the show?
[12669.52 --> 12670.78]  I don't even think you've seen them all.
[12671.48 --> 12671.94]  Them all?
[12672.16 --> 12672.94]  Have you seen them all?
[12673.62 --> 12674.66]  When's the last time you used the site?
[12675.62 --> 12677.68]  Uh, when I saw us tweet about it.
[12678.38 --> 12679.24]  Tweet about what?
[12679.34 --> 12680.76]  About the new layout and stuff.
[12681.18 --> 12682.58]  Oh, have you seen the page layout though?
[12682.62 --> 12683.14]  Not this.
[12683.14 --> 12685.66]  Have you seen the layout changes to the actual product pages?
[12685.84 --> 12686.42]  Have you seen this?
[12686.58 --> 12686.68]  Yeah.
[12687.06 --> 12689.70]  Where it like animates the hardware notes thing on the left hand side and stuff?
[12689.88 --> 12690.06]  Yeah.
[12690.30 --> 12691.58]  See when it, it loads the next thing.
[12691.66 --> 12692.26]  It's like, what did you do?
[12692.30 --> 12692.72]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12692.74 --> 12694.54]  I came on when, when we tweeted about it.
[12694.66 --> 12696.66]  I found out about it in a tweet, which is hilarious.
[12696.86 --> 12697.98]  I didn't even know we tweeted about it.
[12698.06 --> 12698.38]  Oh yeah.
[12698.66 --> 12698.98]  Okay.
[12699.16 --> 12699.34]  Yeah.
[12700.04 --> 12702.16]  They were like, Hey, come check out the, uh,
[12702.16 --> 12703.08]  I think it's awesome.
[12703.16 --> 12703.96]  I think it looks great.
[12704.14 --> 12704.98]  I think it's really awesome.
[12705.02 --> 12705.58]  Looks super pro.
[12705.58 --> 12706.30]  Yeah.
[12707.30 --> 12714.08]  Um, I will, I will yet again, not publicly say the, the roadmap, but there is, uh, something
[12714.08 --> 12717.32]  that we're looking into working on right now, which I think people will like a lot.
[12717.32 --> 12721.64]  And it's in the spirit of some of the redesigns we've done to the, to the front page and the
[12721.64 --> 12722.18]  product pages.
[12722.18 --> 12725.02]  And honestly, I, I think it's really sharp.
[12725.66 --> 12729.64]  Um, I think some of the, the work that's been done there has been really, really good.
[12729.74 --> 12730.00]  Oops.
[12730.02 --> 12730.84]  I clicked the wrong link.
[12730.84 --> 12734.28]  Are we fans of fanless power supplies?
[12734.36 --> 12735.40]  This is actually pretty cool.
[12736.00 --> 12738.66]  Um, they looked at articles we've been doing are awesome.
[12738.78 --> 12740.28]  They've got thermals and efficiency.
[12741.24 --> 12747.44]  Um, the answer, unless you're a liar or stupid is almost always, it's pretty much always going
[12747.44 --> 12747.96]  to be, it depends.
[12748.14 --> 12748.52]  It depends.
[12749.46 --> 12752.60]  So then you got to read the rest of the, you got to read the rest of the thing.
[12752.90 --> 12753.14]  Yeah.
[12753.74 --> 12754.06]  Yeah.
[12754.06 --> 12758.26]  I really like the, the aesthetic direction that we're taking with the lab site right now.
[12758.26 --> 12764.50]  I think the changes that were done to the sections of the product pages, um, even it might not
[12764.50 --> 12769.88]  seem that important, but even like, like this, I'm going to bring up my, so where it says hardware
[12769.88 --> 12775.64]  notes here, it's going to seem really small, but just when you scroll down, having it do
[12775.64 --> 12780.24]  that makes the page feel a lot more dynamic in my opinion.
[12780.42 --> 12780.66]  Yeah.
[12780.82 --> 12784.50]  So as you're going through, we used to have all the sections automatically minimize.
[12784.60 --> 12785.48]  They don't do that anymore.
[12785.48 --> 12787.22]  Um, which I think is better.
[12787.74 --> 12790.30]  Um, it has that little animation thing.
[12790.38 --> 12791.92]  So the page kind of feels alive.
[12792.08 --> 12796.46]  I really, really like Dan's whole concept here by having other Dan.
[12796.92 --> 12797.32]  Yes.
[12797.52 --> 12802.40]  Uh, by, by having all of the like picture and stat information on the right and the write
[12802.40 --> 12803.32]  up stuff on the left.
[12803.42 --> 12808.70]  So it feels like, and the write up stays with you as you're scrolling through the stat information.
[12808.70 --> 12811.22]  So it's just, I don't know what the flow just feels really good.
[12811.82 --> 12816.98]  Um, I'm, I really like how the site feels right now.
[12817.44 --> 12820.58]  Um, I think it's, I think it's great.
[12821.08 --> 12822.38]  There's, there's still work to be done.
[12822.52 --> 12825.84]  We need to work on stuff like the, uh, comparison bin, stuff like that.
[12825.84 --> 12830.48]  Um, but yeah, it's really, it's really coming into its own in my opinion.
[12832.92 --> 12835.56]  So you're still interim head of labs, right?
[12836.72 --> 12837.16]  Sure.
[12837.28 --> 12839.26]  Are you applying for the job or like?
[12839.26 --> 12840.34]  Am I applying for the job?
[12840.34 --> 12840.66]  I don't know.
[12840.70 --> 12841.26]  I don't know how this works.
[12841.26 --> 12842.70]  I'm not applying for the, I don't audition.
[12842.84 --> 12843.58]  I just work here.
[12844.98 --> 12845.80]  Don't audition.
[12846.46 --> 12848.24]  You take me or you don't, brother.
[12848.50 --> 12849.76]  We'll see you again next week.
[12849.84 --> 12851.66]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[12851.90 --> 12852.30]  Bye.
[12852.30 --> 12852.36]  Bye.
[12853.12 --> 12854.36]  I don't audition.
[12854.78 --> 12855.10]  Jesus.
[12855.10 --> 12861.46]  It's after eight.
[12861.54 --> 12862.06]  You need to go.
[12862.24 --> 12862.38]  Oh.
[12864.22 --> 12866.30]  I lost, I lost track.
[12867.14 --> 12868.12]  And then I realized.
[12868.54 --> 12869.72]  I was tracking the game.
[12870.76 --> 12871.24]  Oh.
[12875.24 --> 12875.92]  Oh, yeah.
[12875.92 --> 12876.32]  I lost.
[12876.32 --> 12876.96]  I lost.
[12876.96 --> 12877.54]  I lost.
[12883.78 --> 12884.52]  I lost.
[12884.76 --> 12885.18]  I lost.
[12885.32 --> 12887.14]  I lost.
[12887.14 --> 12887.22]  I lost.
[12887.22 --> 12889.40]  I lost.
[12895.40 --> 12896.24]  I lost.
[12896.38 --> 12896.82]  I lost.
[12896.82 --> 12897.10]  I lost.
[12897.10 --> 12897.18]  I lost.
