[0.00 → 4.74] What is up everyone and welcome to what I hope is going to become a new trend on the WAN show.
[5.66 → 6.24] We're on time?
[6.66 → 7.58] We are early.
[7.88 → 8.12] Oh.
[8.32 → 13.46] Now think about this. If we could be this early for a consecutive year.
[13.52 → 14.46] We could like to make up.
[14.50 → 16.90] We could make our way back to neutral.
[17.12 → 18.36] That is a good point.
[18.48 → 22.62] We've got a great show lined up for you guys today. Of course our headline topic is
[22.62 → 30.06] Adobe getting their just deserts of finally getting at least some attention on some of the
[30.06 → 39.44] if not illegal at least very anti-consumer and offensive billing practices that they have
[39.44 → 43.96] participated in over the last little while. I got signed out of Google Docs right as I was
[43.96 → 51.02] saying that so Luke gets to pick three topics today. No Luke. Luke it's your day. It's your day to shine.
[51.02 → 57.46] The Snapdragon X launch was not quite what people had hoped, but there are there is some
[57.46 → 63.22] good news. Also, Nvidia becomes the world's most valuable company. Didn't they already become?
[63.72 → 70.64] Oh yeah. Continues to do extremely Nvidia like things. Nice. We'll also discuss and
[70.64 → 80.00] his brain develops real-time emotion cancelling tech. It was a very, very short break, but his brain was
[80.00 → 86.08] like I have done two topics now. Surely the intro will come.
[86.08 → 110.36] Today's show is brought to you by Squarespace, MSI,
[110.36 → 118.80] Control D and of course our chair partner Secret Lab. Why don't we jump right into the big Adobe topic
[118.80 → 126.24] first assuming that I can find it? Ah, yes. Okay no I don't want to do that. What I want to do first
[126.24 → 133.26] is I want to talk about the moment when I realized Adobe had completely jumped the shark. So when we were
[133.26 → 140.64] in the early but not quite like ridiculous growth phase where we added like 50 people in 18
[140.64 → 146.22] months or 24 months or whatever it was but when we were growing at a pretty steady clip and adding
[146.22 → 154.92] creatives to our cloud. I don't I actually don't think of our team as a cloud of employees that's
[154.92 → 163.86] actually super weird. They're not sperm. I thought you're going somewhere else with that. Anymore.
[163.92 → 175.26] What? I haven't slept much. Oh, man. The point is the point is that when we were when we were growing
[175.26 → 182.24] at a pretty steady clip. One of the things that you have to do is you have to add seats to your
[182.24 → 187.78] Adobe Creative Cloud subscription right. So every time we would add a new person part of the onboarding
[187.78 → 194.38] was for us to grab a new Adobe Creative Cloud subscription and set it to their email and they
[194.38 → 199.80] would have you know two concurrent logins and all those rules and everything right. But then
[199.80 → 206.14] one day something bizarre happened. Someone left or was fired or something. I can't remember but
[206.14 → 213.58] for the first time in forever our headcount in the editing department or in the creative
[213.58 → 220.16] one of the creative departments went down by one, and I was like oh okay I was the administrator of
[220.16 → 226.06] our Adobe account at the time, and I was like well surely this is no problem. I will simply go in and
[226.06 → 228.06] I'll see you.
[228.06 → 235.76] You can't remove a seat. When when you just like when you're an organization that has I mean at
[235.76 → 240.12] that point we probably had somewhere between half a dozen and a dozen seats or something like that
[240.12 → 244.70] and when you're an organization that has a bunch of seats when you add another seat
[244.70 → 252.20] you you can't cancel it unless you pay I think you can pay like an um I think you
[252.20 → 258.82] can pay a cancelling yeah an early termination fee but that that blew my mind the fact that
[258.82 → 266.24] adding and adding seats was like permanent like if you is your company didn't just grow forever
[266.24 → 273.70] yeah that that that was it. The whole seat system is just crazy to me in general like there's a lot of
[273.70 → 280.82] enterprise software enterprise SaaS solutions that operate on a seat system, and it doesn't make any
[280.82 → 287.22] sense to me. Of course that's not the part that's necessarily illegal let's get into why Adobe is being
[287.22 → 293.16] jointly sued by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission alleging that the company
[293.16 → 302.36] imposed a hidden early termination fee and complex and challenging cancellation process upon subscribers
[302.36 → 308.64] violating the restore online shoppers' confidence act wow what a catchy name which has been around since
[308.64 → 314.68] 2010. So it's the hidden nature it's the dark patterns that were present in the sign-up process
[314.68 → 320.22] that made it so that, and you know what truthfully if I had read the entire terms and conditions
[320.22 → 325.88] I probably would have known I probably would have known that I was signing up for a one-year subscription
[325.88 → 333.22] not simply adding another seat to my monthly bill that I was that I was paying because from my
[333.22 → 340.22] point of view I wasn't terminating anything I was just altering the deal pray I don't alter it further
[340.22 → 345.66] you know like I was just I was just changing the amount I was paying them per month but from their
[345.66 → 354.46] point of view no, no we have a dozen individual year-long contracts and I don't know whichever one you've
[354.46 → 359.84] cancelled is whichever one has the longest amount left no I actually don't know that part um I do
[359.84 → 364.44] wonder how that works now this is pretty cool oh right, so I was going to say sure I could have read
[364.44 → 371.00] all of that, but realistically I was running a fledgling business what I was going to I was going to spend a
[371.00 → 376.46] bunch of money on a lawyer that we can't afford to read a EULA for me, or I was going to sit
[376.46 → 381.48] and waste like two hours of my day reading a EULA they know that isn't going to happen and that's why
[381.48 → 388.72] they hide these details in these verbose documents now this is the most interesting part
[388.72 → 396.98] of this because some like a**hole company uh having deceptive or misleading subscription practices is not
[396.98 → 404.48] exactly newsworthy, but what is really fascinating about this to me is that the lawsuit is targeting
[404.48 → 412.04] specific Adobe executives Manner Şahin San president of digital media business and
[412.04 → 421.50] David Wadai the VP of digital go-to-market and sales I don't I don't follow this as closely as
[421.50 → 427.12] you know some legal scholars probably do so for you in the comments thank you for your scholarship
[427.12 → 434.56] in the field of legality um and I appreciate that you've noticed this before, but I haven't
[434.56 → 442.44] noticed this before going after a company while also specifically naming individuals who would have
[442.44 → 450.64] had to be complicit in these practices it seems I love it is seems good I love it I think
[450.64 → 459.04] it's good why do you get to why do you get to just be like well no a corporation is a person, and I was just the
[459.04 → 468.64] like shoulder skin cell surely you can't convict me of murder just because the right hand was all stab stab stab stab
[472.08 → 478.64] there should be some accountability for the individuals in these organizations that are making these decisions
[478.64 → 488.40] enthusiastically yes I I am happy anyway uh the US DOJ and FTC alleged that Adobe pushed Creative Cloud
[488.40 → 493.52] subscribers into annual plans without disclosing that cancelling the first year could cost hundreds of
[493.52 → 499.44] dollars under the leadership of chair Lena Khan the FTC has been cracking down on deceptive practices
[499.44 → 504.72] like this last year they filed a similar lawsuit against Amazon for their prime membership sign up and
[504.72 → 511.60] the end cancellation process which was awesome I'm I'm super happy about this I think this is absolutely
[511.60 → 518.00] fantastic um it turned out we didn't end up cancelling our subscription because we knew we were probably going
[518.00 → 526.40] to hire someone because we were growing and that is exactly the kind of I'm going to say it outright theft
[526.40 → 532.88] that these kinds of practices allow where I signed a deal not understanding the terms not because I'm an
[532.88 → 538.16] idiot but because they buried it somewhere knowing that I would be sort of an idiot some fractional
[538.16 → 545.52] amount of an idiot um but aren't we all justifiably idiotic there I need a shirt that says that on it
[547.60 → 552.80] I'm an idiot in a way that I can really that I can really put my convictions behind
[552.80 → 563.20] So they took that money from me because I didn't properly understand the deal where I paid for nothing for some period of time
[563.68 → 567.92] Until we actually added another person a lot of people are saying they would buy that shirt
[568.24 → 571.20] The jokes on you though adobe because at that time
[571.36 → 576.08] We were using our second sign-in to have twice as many editors as we had license
[576.08 → 582.32] Yeah get owned yeah, yeah, I broke your terms of service, and I don't even feel bad
[583.44 → 586.32] Also, we used pirated cs6 for like the first
[587.20 → 589.20] probably year or two
[591.44 → 594.00] I don't remember when we actually first bought creative cloud
[594.24 → 596.96] We used pirated Sony Vegas before that if it helps
[597.92 → 598.64] Was that real?
[598.64 → 599.36] That was paid
[599.36 → 606.72] Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I actually I am one of the dozens who purchased Sony Vegas movie studio
[608.24 → 612.24] I kind of liked it. Yeah, if you don't do anything special in it at all
[612.80 → 617.60] It's really easy to use you can even do some like kind of some cool stuff in it
[617.60 → 619.68] Some special things in it. The fact that oh, man
[619.76 → 622.64] The fact that adobe software has so many
[623.28 → 631.20] Tiny tiny tiny little icons and I get it. I get it macros and and and hotkeys and everything are absolutely
[631.76 → 633.76] an essential part way to go of
[634.00 → 636.00] using this software but
[636.16 → 639.28] Imagine for a moment if you know there were certain
[640.00 → 642.48] manipulations that I could do on the timeline that just
[643.28 → 645.28] Didn't require me to click on a
[645.92 → 650.40] Teeny tiny little indicator button and also didn't require me to press anything on my keyboard
[650.40 → 654.32] And the whole thing was just a lot more casual. I actually quite liked
[654.88 → 657.76] Editing at Sony Vegas. Yes, it's owned by magics now
[658.32 → 659.52] um
[659.76 → 661.44] Who is magics?
[661.44 → 669.68] Someone yeah, it's magics Vegas. That's a worse name. Yeah, I assume that there are lions involved or tigers. Dang it
[669.68 → 678.24] My brain is so tired that I was like Sigmund and Freud. No, wait
[678.64 → 680.16] Siegfried and Roy that's the one
[683.28 → 684.64] Why don't we do another topic?
[686.96 → 691.76] Oh, fantastic my brain doesn't turn on before noon at the best of times
[691.76 → 697.60] Oh, yeah last night. I was up pretty late working on a slideshow. So yeah, I am
[698.56 → 700.48] I'm in a'm a vibe today
[701.12 → 706.96] My hair is as flat as I feel tired. Come on. Let's get this some let's get this some elevation here
[706.96 → 711.76] That did not work at all. Okay. Well, you work on that. I'll go with the snapdragon x launch
[712.08 → 715.36] Snapdragon x launch not quite Microsoft's Apple Silicon moment
[715.36 → 720.48] But hey, they sleep and wake real good, which is actually I mean, I mean that's uh, that's a win
[720.48 → 726.48] That's a genuine w I'm I'm honestly that would make me consider switching
[727.60 → 729.84] Right that what do I even do on my laptop?
[730.80 → 732.40] Browser like nothing. Yeah
[734.08 → 737.36] Do I look as tired as I think I do? I think we sort of both do
[738.40 → 740.08] I think you
[740.08 → 743.36] You probably look a little bit more tired because I probably got a little bit more sleep, but nice
[744.00 → 747.52] But yeah, what were you up so late doing? Oh, just being me
[747.52 → 753.20] I wasn't up nearly as lazy. Okay. Yeah, so just dumb. Yeah, nice. Yeah
[753.68 → 757.68] Justifiably so though. Yeah, yeah, yeah, cool. He needed the time
[761.52 → 766.96] But like I mean yeah, Elijah, it's just me and I'm actually not kidding get back to work
[766.96 → 771.12] Turn off the land show you can watch later. You're being a very bad example
[772.64 → 774.24] Okay, go optics
[775.28 → 779.12] It took me like six years of that speech to get it you'll get there eventually. Yeah, man
[780.40 → 783.36] Dude the conversations I used to have with this guy be like look
[783.92 → 787.92] Okay, if I like to slip you a power supply or something like don't
[788.96 → 791.44] Don't make a song and dance of it because like
[791.44 → 798.40] You can't give a power supply to everyone, you know, just like you're going to make it so that we can't do
[798.72 → 800.80] This is why we can't have nice things because
[802.00 → 806.16] As soon as, as soon as people make a big deal about stuff. It's like, okay, well look
[806.16 → 810.80] We can't give out a hundred power supplies every time, you know, we do something
[810.80 → 814.32] It's like now people aren't allowed to borrow stuff from the office anymore. Yep
[815.20 → 817.92] Way to go Luke. I think that was mostly camera stuff, wasn't it?
[817.92 → 820.80] um, it started with the camera stuff because
[821.44 → 824.24] camera operators would borrow things, and it was
[825.04 → 829.36] Mostly fine except that all of a sudden we had so many creatives and only
[830.00 → 836.08] So many cameras and all of a sudden we're sitting here going okay. So sorry, what are we going to create like a sign-out sheet?
[836.32 → 842.56] Like a prioritization system and one of the big challenges is that if they don't have
[843.04 → 847.76] Actual third-party insurance for the shoot that they're doing which mostly they didn't because it was like little indie projects
[847.76 → 850.56] Yeah stuff if they don't have it legally
[851.20 → 855.76] I actually am not allowed to just like take it out of their pay or whatever
[856.00 → 856.88] Right, that makes sense
[856.88 → 862.80] They can voluntarily pay it back and I could choose to accept that
[863.44 → 867.84] But if is something gets broken like from a legal standpoint here in bc
[868.32 → 870.88] I can't just like dock someone's pay to be
[871.28 → 873.92] Decompensated for something that they broke or lost it doesn't work that way
[873.92 → 879.92] So the liability of having people just like borrowing stuff all the time and the tracking of it was all of a sudden going to be like a
[880.48 → 883.52] Substantial amount of someone's job, and we're looking at it going like how does this
[884.24 → 886.24] How does this make any sense?
[888.48 → 891.84] All right snapdragon x sorry, I go on no worries
[891.84 → 897.04] Yeah, the first copilot plus laptops powered by Qualcomm's arm-based snapdragon x series chips
[897.04 → 901.44] Officially launched on Tuesday and so far reviews are tentatively positive
[902.00 → 905.52] Praising the arrival of windows laptops that actually sleep and wake properly
[905.84 → 911.76] But get ready for the caveats the only full reviews on launch day were for the Asus VivoBook
[912.16 → 915.76] S15 featuring the lowest tier snapdragon x elite the
[916.72 → 920.00] x1e78 100 can I interrupt for a second
[920.00 → 924.48] As part of our briefing with Qualcomm
[925.12 → 925.84] um
[926.00 → 931.36] This part clearly did not make it into the sponsored piece that we did on the launch
[931.92 → 934.24] um, but as part of our breeding with breeding
[936.24 → 938.08] As part of our briefing with Qualcomm
[938.64 → 938.96] um
[939.92 → 943.36] I probably let them have it for about
[944.08 → 945.28] 13
[945.28 → 945.68] minutes
[946.48 → 949.84] on their naming scheme for these things yeah during your uh
[950.64 → 955.60] Dude, you let them have it for 13 minutes. Yeah. Yeah, during your what yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no, no, no
[955.60 → 957.76] That was much less than 13 minutes. Are you kidding me?
[959.04 → 962.64] Do you know how happy Yvonne would be if I could go 13 minutes? No. Oh, no, um
[963.36 → 968.16] So that is the dude that is the actual model number of that chip
[969.76 → 974.08] X1e-78-100 is a consumer facing model number
[974.08 → 982.40] I'm I'm not even I'm and I was like no you guys need to change that now
[982.96 → 984.80] And they're like what's wrong with it?
[985.68 → 990.32] What does it even stand for so x1e? I'm assuming is like x1 elite
[990.88 → 993.28] Yes, but then what is 78 and 100?
[993.52 → 996.48] So I didn't even realize they all seem to end in 100
[996.48 → 1000.72] I didn't even realize until we were doing our briefing with them that there are
[1002.40 → 1002.96] uh
[1002.96 → 1010.00] That there are that there are various um bins of the various snapdragon elite chips
[1010.00 → 1016.16] So here you go. Here's the here's the skew lineup, uh, from like some article or something that this just
[1016.72 → 1018.08] Demonstrates my point
[1018.08 → 1024.88] So it's its snapdragon x1 elite and snapdragon or snapdragon x elite and snapdragon x
[1025.68 → 1029.68] Plus I've got I've got no problem with that. That's fine. Sure
[1029.68 → 1031.68] And they were like, so yeah, so what's wrong with it?
[1031.68 → 1035.60] It's snapdragon x elite and snapdragon x plus I'm like nothing that's great
[1035.60 → 1043.12] That's basically like your you know, your good better best. It's your it's your it's your i5 i7. It's your um, you know
[1043.68 → 1049.92] Uh, your your your regular your LE your see your touring or whatever, you know coming back to cars
[1049.92 → 1056.72] It's you sure that's fine. You got your different trim levels. You got your different stratified product lines
[1057.44 → 1059.44] No problem
[1059.44 → 1061.76] What the ever loving is this?
[1061.76 → 1067.44] So I'm like, okay, no problem. We got x1 elite I'm with you here
[1068.08 → 1070.08] Then we've got a designation
[1070.72 → 1078.72] Okay, so we got 84 80 and 78, so these are three different bins of the chip that run at uh different clock speeds
[1079.28 → 1080.72] that ironically
[1081.44 → 1084.08] If I'm kind of looking at this, okay, so the
[1084.64 → 1088.96] 84 is four more than 80, and it gets
[1088.96 → 1095.12] 0.2 gigahertz more but we oh, no, but the uh, but the GPU is a lot
[1096.00 → 1100.08] Faster and then the 80 is only two more than the 78
[1100.48 → 1106.88] But it's clocked like way the crap higher on two core max turbos on the CPU, but it gets the same GP
[1108.08 → 1112.00] What does this mean also? Why is there a random 100 at the end?
[1112.00 → 1119.60] I think you can either keep the one in between the x and the e, or you can keep the 100 you got to pick one drop the other
[1120.16 → 1120.32] um
[1120.32 → 1121.44] I
[1122.00 → 1123.84] I do not understand
[1124.56 → 1126.88] Uh, the 100 is probably the generation. I don't care
[1127.36 → 1133.52] But then what's the one in between the x1e basically I what I told them was I was like look have you ever been to London drugs?
[1133.52 → 1141.44] London drugs is a regional sort of I don't know what they sell everything they have like bag chips and
[1141.60 → 1147.52] Cosmetics and TVs like a really expensive corner store that also has a pharmacy small appliances like it's its I don't know
[1147.52 → 1149.20] It's kind of a weird it's kind of a weird chain
[1149.20 → 1154.40] Yeah, they seem like they seem like kind of cool people sort of cowboys, but like in a cool way anyway
[1154.88 → 1156.08] London drugs everyone
[1156.08 → 1158.08] London drugs seems like cowboys
[1158.08 → 1164.40] Like I just mean like, you know, like yeah, you know, they just yeah, they yeah exactly all right they're cowboys. Yeah, um
[1165.36 → 1169.04] So I went into one recently to buy a television for my grandparents
[1169.52 → 1174.32] they just needed a bigger TV so that they could see the picture on the screen and
[1175.36 → 1179.44] They carry a handful of brands and what I noticed was that hey
[1179.44 → 1183.76] It's been a while since I've been in a small regional electronics store because you know
[1183.76 → 1186.48] I used to work at one, and then I had no reason to go to one after that
[1186.48 → 1192.32] And I was walking I was trying to compare TVs to each other because I've been out of the loop for a little bit sure on
[1192.32 → 1193.84] On on on budget TVs
[1193.84 → 1199.28] Like I kind of know what's going on at the high end that everyone wants to talk to you about at a trade show or whatever
[1199.28 → 1202.56] But in terms of what people actually buy I was like, okay
[1202.56 → 1205.04] Well, I'm just I'm gonna need to kind of refresh myself on
[1205.44 → 1208.88] You know does this one how many local dimming zones does this have and
[1209.36 → 1209.76] uh
[1209.76 → 1216.16] Does this one have how many HDMI inputs does this have like that kind of thing and as I went around, and I looked at the little
[1216.16 → 1218.48] Product cards, right? I realized that
[1219.76 → 1221.60] They weren't comparable to each other at all
[1222.24 → 1224.24] They told me basically nothing
[1224.40 → 1230.32] Um, and so this was custom like this is our version of whatever well it just there was no consistency
[1230.88 → 1234.96] So Joe in the warehouse might have printed up this one
[1235.44 → 1240.64] And then sally at the in the front might have printed up this one, and she didn't look at what Joe did
[1240.64 → 1244.96] So do you she just kind of made up her own list of key important specs?
[1245.44 → 1246.32] So they were
[1246.32 → 1250.08] I see okay there. It was so hard to compare and
[1250.72 → 1251.92] realistically
[1251.92 → 1254.24] I talked to I talked to sally
[1254.96 → 1260.32] No, it was some dude. I don't remember their name, but I talked to someone I was like this is even less helpful
[1260.80 → 1262.40] um
[1262.56 → 1267.36] But that's what that's what a lot of people are dealing with when they go to when they go to buy something
[1267.36 → 1269.84] And frankly the big box stores are not a lot better
[1270.32 → 1275.68] And so like I was at a Costco, and I was comparing the cards on the different pcs and TVs and stuff just because
[1276.16 → 1280.64] I was thinking about this afterward, and I was like, yeah, it's its better, but it's not consistent either
[1281.12 → 1283.52] And so what I was talking to them about is I was like look
[1285.36 → 1286.48] This
[1286.48 → 1290.24] Is confusing this is going to end up on their like what does it mean?
[1290.24 → 1294.96] And they like they brought out their decoder sheet kind of like intel has for it for their product names
[1294.96 → 1298.80] And I was like right, but the consumer's not going to have that so
[1299.44 → 1300.48] basically
[1300.48 → 1302.24] My problem so far
[1302.80 → 1310.16] Because we haven't gotten through the rest of the topic is I would like to see a coherent naming scheme. I would like to see I would like to see these
[1311.36 → 1312.48] You know what I give up
[1313.20 → 1315.20] This is the same company that just has
[1315.92 → 1318.40] snapdragon 8 gen whatever
[1319.60 → 1323.76] I actually no forget it. Let's keep going. It's just not going to happen. Yep. Carry on
[1323.76 → 1325.36] Okay
[1326.24 → 1332.64] Most performance and efficiency benchmarks have it matching or slightly exceeding intel and AMD's current competitors, which is
[1333.28 → 1341.76] Good to hear it usually beats apple's base m3 in multicore but is worse when it comes to single core performance and efficiency
[1342.40 → 1347.20] Gaming performance is still in question the copilot plus pcs are not gaming laptops
[1347.28 → 1351.20] But despite launching a dedicated website to catalogue game compatibility
[1351.20 → 1358.80] Early reviews noted games like overwatch 2 and Witcher 3 performed much worse than their ratings would actually suggest
[1359.36 → 1362.80] Some reviews covering the faster x1e 80 100
[1363.44 → 1365.04] Wow
[1365.04 → 1365.68] That sucks
[1365.68 → 1367.52] Uh, and the x1e 80
[1367.52 → 1372.72] 4 100 have started to trickle out but truly comprehensive reviews are in short supply
[1372.72 → 1375.84] I want to see the 100 dropped Qualcomm if you're watching this
[1376.24 → 1381.20] Just lose the 100, and we're good x1e 80 and x1e 84 would have been great
[1381.28 → 1384.32] And then when you go to next generation just makes it make it x2e
[1384.32 → 1387.44] Yeah, perfect, and it would be solution solved. Yep
[1388.00 → 1394.00] According to windows central's Zach Baden many media outlets only received review units on Tuesday
[1394.16 → 1396.24] thanks to Microsoft's last minute recall
[1396.80 → 1398.00] of its
[1398.00 → 1402.88] Recall feature that is a funny line, but yeah it also something that actually happened
[1402.88 → 1412.32] Uh, Microsoft has also reportedly changed copilot from a locally run to a progressive web app removing its ability to control windows settings, which
[1412.32 → 1414.72] um, is less convenient
[1415.28 → 1423.52] But probably perfect for security better with that said sorry. I'm totally gonna tangent again. Sure. We did a super cool video this week
[1424.24 → 1425.84] That's not the show. That's sort of the show
[1426.80 → 1429.84] It's an integral part of the show people care about
[1430.96 → 1432.48] All right
[1432.48 → 1439.92] We did a really cool video this week. We got our hands on a hard drive that contained basically every
[1440.56 → 1444.32] Malware known to man. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you see you know about this. Yeah, um, well, I know about
[1445.20 → 1448.00] Both the hard drive and the fact that we have it. Yeah, um
[1448.96 → 1454.24] Yeah, is your team like terrified that that is sitting on a shelf here? Oh, no, it's like a thing you can just get those
[1454.24 → 1459.52] I know yeah, yeah, but does it bother you that it's just like here and someone could like to grab it and do something with it?
[1462.08 → 1468.56] Not really doesn't really matter you can download all the same stuff. It's from a place called VX underground. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, super cool
[1468.56 → 1476.56] Uh, a little sketchy. I actually I I I we don't really know anything about the folks that are behind it
[1476.56 → 1479.76] So I'm not there is no recommendation here. Uh, just
[1480.48 → 1481.20] We bought a hard drive
[1481.20 → 1486.64] But it's cool, and it's an it's a fascinating tool for like learning about how this stuff works
[1486.64 → 1491.04] Yes, and I will tell you that I know fundamentally
[1491.04 → 1499.28] Understood, you know how things can get pwned, and you know people can you know remote access whatever what you know remote access Trojan
[1499.28 → 1502.56] You know rat and you whatever I'd never seen the interface
[1503.36 → 1505.36] I'd never used one
[1505.36 → 1507.36] um
[1511.60 → 1514.56] We fired up the boar rat
[1514.56 → 1523.28] And like oh my god the fact that copilot can't change your settings anymore or whatever
[1523.28 → 1524.64] It's like honestly
[1525.36 → 1531.44] Probably kind of irrelevant like yes more attack vectors is worse. It's a different way in but
[1532.16 → 1537.20] Realistically knowing that social engineering is so much of how people are got
[1537.20 → 1542.32] And the fact that an application like this exists that allows you to do
[1543.04 → 1544.24] Literally
[1544.24 → 1548.08] Anything to the target computer you can do anything you can
[1548.88 → 1550.56] BSOD it for fun you
[1553.84 → 1558.24] Like you can do anything so guys check out the video it's going to be it's going to be a lot of fun
[1558.80 → 1559.60] um
[1560.64 → 1561.76] But
[1561.76 → 1566.88] Basically, what I'm saying is yeah, it's probably good that copilot is not going to be an attack vector
[1566.88 → 1570.96] Fewer holes in the Swiss cheese less holes in the Swiss cheese, but realistically
[1571.68 → 1573.36] There are a lot of holes in the Swiss cheese. Yeah
[1573.84 → 1577.12] They don't call it Swiss cheese because it's a solid block right now
[1577.76 → 1580.64] Modern Windows machines with windows defender are pretty good
[1581.84 → 1586.16] Sure, it's a lot better than it used to be yeah like actually oh trust me. I know I mean
[1586.64 → 1587.52] I and I
[1588.48 → 1594.88] I remember when you couldn't have your network port plugged in while you installed Windows XP if you had an old disk because
[1595.44 → 1601.04] Otherwise blaster worm would literally infect the system just randomly before you did anything
[1601.68 → 1604.00] Faster than you could download an antivirus program
[1607.20 → 1609.20] Oh, man
[1610.88 → 1613.28] Okay, where was I? I don't know
[1614.24 → 1621.60] Microsoft also reportedly changed copilot. Oh, right. No already read that the surprisingly capable new arm chips are in danger of being
[1621.60 → 1628.56] Being overshadowed in a couple of months by intel's very impressive looking lunar lake and AMD's dozen AI
[1629.68 → 1634.40] 300 laptop chips not to mention m4 macBooks expected in the fall
[1635.20 → 1638.08] Wait, hold on. Yeah, can we actually give apple props?
[1639.44 → 1641.44] For what is their chip names?
[1642.00 → 1643.76] Yes, they're good. Yes
[1643.76 → 1650.88] They are good. They're good. They're easy to understand extremely what is a m1 ultra quick a
[1651.76 → 1653.76] better m1
[1654.64 → 1656.64] Sort of
[1656.64 → 1659.52] It well, okay. I haven't followed it at all
[1660.80 → 1664.96] Okay, so a m1 there's there's m1 plus m1 m1 m1
[1664.96 → 1666.16] It's either pro or plus
[1666.16 → 1669.76] uh, m1 max and then m1 ultra is two m1 maxes
[1670.08 → 1673.44] Okay, so basically they've got they've got good better best
[1674.40 → 1676.80] ultimate which is totally fine
[1677.36 → 1680.32] You've got you've got m which is your know
[1681.04 → 1685.28] What it is? I don't know. It's apple m silicon. Don't worry about it. And then you've just got a generation name
[1685.60 → 1690.16] It's funny because apple is both the best and the worst at this stuff
[1691.04 → 1696.00] Even the even as bloated as the like give it a good name or just don't actually name it at all
[1696.00 → 1701.04] As bloated as the iPhone lineup has become with you know pro and plus and pro max
[1702.00 → 1706.40] Everything has a clear meaning what is pro it means it has sort of
[1706.40 → 1710.08] Something extra that probably most people don't need um
[1712.08 → 1716.80] It got a little bit confusing when they did that generation I forget what it was where they had both
[1717.28 → 1719.76] What was it the eight and the ten, and then they like skipped nine?
[1719.76 → 1724.64] That was all that when they had the x yeah, because but I at least there was a reason for it
[1724.64 → 1730.80] It was the 10th anniversary and they the 3g and 3gs sort of generation had gotten a little
[1731.28 → 1736.24] Muddy with respect to you know what gen was what, and they were kind of like they were almost like
[1736.64 → 1743.04] Like fixing it um, and okay, there has been again a little bit of muddiness where sometimes
[1743.68 → 1749.28] You know you get a generational number on an iPhone, but it actually has the last gen chip that the current gen is like that
[1749.28 → 1753.20] If I recall correctly, we're only the like pro got the current gen chip
[1753.20 → 1755.36] Okay, so things can get a little bit confusing
[1756.88 → 1760.24] But year to year it's very clear exactly
[1760.24 → 1768.32] You know which one you've got, and then they've got if you're buying an iPhone then they've got stuff like the mac pro
[1769.76 → 1773.44] They just keep calling it mac pro and I'm expected to know
[1774.16 → 1777.20] What portion of which year it was released?
[1777.44 → 1780.72] I'm supposed to keep track of that like that's absolutely ridiculous
[1780.72 → 1788.16] So I don't get it because clearly apple knows how to name things so that it so that you understand that there's like
[1788.64 → 1792.56] A benefit to upgrading to it, but sometimes they just don't want you to know that
[1793.60 → 1800.88] You just have MacBook Air, and it's like, okay. Yeah, I've got I've got MacBook Air. Why can't I install a modern browser on it?
[1801.68 → 1803.20] uh, what is this name?
[1804.48 → 1804.96] seas
[1804.96 → 1806.96] Contra
[1808.40 → 1813.36] We got the Europeans in the chat today. There's going to be some dates. I can't pronounce very well nice
[1813.68 → 1820.64] Um, he said but the processor completes the name now. Uh, this is the mac pro with m2 chip
[1823.36 → 1827.20] Okay, well then that's good help a bit that helps a lot that helps a lot so hey
[1827.92 → 1833.36] Kudos for improvement. Yeah. Yeah, way to go. Yeah, I'm happy to see it
[1833.92 → 1838.72] There are a lot of mac pros that do not have that. Yes, just to be clear. Yes
[1839.68 → 1841.92] All right, considering not to uh, so
[1842.56 → 1844.56] There's the new intel and AMD
[1844.80 → 1850.88] Laptops coming and also the new m4 macBooks are expected in the fall a new leak indicates that Qualcomm
[1851.36 → 1856.72] Has more unannounced x-series CPUs coming, although they are on the lower end of the lineup
[1856.72 → 1858.72] So it probably isn't gonna matter
[1858.72 → 1861.92] Um, you should stream this time of day more often what the heck we have like
[1863.44 → 1864.88] Significantly more viewers than usual
[1865.60 → 1868.16] Is it just because it's abnormal? I have no idea
[1869.12 → 1872.08] nice nice nice
[1872.96 → 1873.36] um
[1874.40 → 1878.80] Yeah, we were spoiled by apple's amazing arm transition. That was wild
[1879.36 → 1882.96] um Qualcomm might have overhyped these we also don't
[1882.96 → 1886.48] Know how the better tier chips are supposed to perform
[1887.04 → 1889.52] Uh, we don't we don't even have a clear idea
[1890.08 → 1894.72] Necessarily of how all the different devices with this chip are going to perform because
[1895.52 → 1898.64] Qualcomm allows their partners to run the net
[1899.36 → 1901.36] Wide range of different TD uh
[1901.92 → 1907.36] They don't use TDP. They use total. I don't care a wide range of total power envelopes
[1907.36 → 1908.24] Um
[1909.52 → 1914.56] I'm still I'm still pretty excited just because a lot of what I do
[1915.36 → 1916.40] I don't need to game
[1917.28 → 1921.12] um, I need working sleep and wake so if that's working great
[1922.00 → 1926.40] That's a w for me. I need great battery life and I need to I need to run a browser
[1926.88 → 1929.76] um, so I am definitely going to start
[1930.48 → 1934.08] I'm gonna daily drive one for some extended period of time
[1934.08 → 1941.36] Um, and we're going to see how it goes. I'm I'm pretty excited apparently Qualcomm's exclusivity deal with Microsoft is coming
[1941.84 → 1946.80] Near to its close and media tech is interested in moving into the space
[1946.80 → 1948.80] So it's not even just going to be
[1948.80 → 1949.84] snapdragon
[1949.84 → 1951.92] whatever dash 100
[1951.92 → 1956.80] Whatever chips, uh, we might also get some media tech chips and if anyone from media tech is watching
[1957.20 → 1960.96] You have an opportunity today to have a coherent naming scheme
[1960.96 → 1965.36] That might literally win over customers reflect on that. Yeah
[1967.04 → 1967.44] Coherency
[1968.24 → 1971.12] It's good. Yeah, it's cash money
[1974.56 → 1976.56] It's Ohio uh
[1977.28 → 1982.00] Kibitz or something no, I was just like, you know, I genuinely don't know what those like a coherent cash
[1983.68 → 1987.04] It's yeah, I don't even deserve the bell
[1987.04 → 1993.12] Uh, all right. Oh, what are we supposed to be doing?
[1993.12 → 1994.00] Yeah, nice
[1995.76 → 2000.72] The muted bell, uh, yeah, you can do another topic. We could do a couple merch messages up to you
[2001.28 → 2003.28] Oh, why don't we do
[2003.28 → 2009.52] Why don't we do a merch message? Let's do a merch message. All right, so if you're not familiar with the show merch messages are the way
[2009.52 → 2014.00] To chat with us don't do a super chat don't do a twitch bit
[2014.64 → 2019.44] Yes, I've seen some criticism of merch messages recently. Yes, the minimum
[2020.40 → 2023.20] Is higher than those other methods is it?
[2023.76 → 2027.36] Yeah, because I think this the cheapest thing is a ten dollar gift card
[2027.92 → 2031.36] And you could, you can send a super chat for like a dollar or something like that
[2031.36 → 2034.56] Um, so you're right. The minimum is higher, but
[2035.44 → 2036.48] That's by design
[2037.12 → 2044.08] Guys, we want you to get something for the money that you're spending which means we actually have to like produce something and ship it to you and all of that stuff
[2044.64 → 2047.12] Um, because we don't want you just throwing money at your screen
[2047.60 → 2054.16] And the reason that we don't want to take your you know the couple of bucks is because if the difference between two and ten dollars
[2054.72 → 2057.20] Is a lot for you. I don't want your money
[2057.20 → 2061.60] For real. I I I actually I actually don't want it
[2062.32 → 2065.84] Um, but if you want to shop on the store go to lttstore.com in the
[2066.40 → 2069.92] cart, uh, there'll be a box whenever we're live where you can leave a merch message
[2070.24 → 2075.52] It can pop up down there at the bottom of the screen. Hey, thank slogan m. Oh, look at that Dan replied to this one
[2075.52 → 2081.28] So he might give you a reply directly. He might forward to someone who might know the answer to your question better
[2081.28 → 2085.60] Or he might curate your message for me and a Luke
[2085.60 → 2090.96] Yeah, hold on a second. We've got we've got someone plate float plane complaining to co says but Linus
[2090.96 → 2092.64] I want to burn my money. That's totally fine
[2093.12 → 2094.32] Just burn more of it
[2095.20 → 2098.96] And if you can't afford to burn that much of it, then that's totally fine
[2099.52 → 2106.32] Don't burn any of it. I'm trying to be a good influence. Yeah, good influence. Yeah. All right. Hit me Dan
[2106.32 → 2108.32] Show us how the merch messages work
[2108.88 → 2115.28] Sure thing. Hey DLL Linus with the announcement of fantasia neo dimension being released on multiple platforms
[2115.28 → 2119.36] Are you going to replay the game on different platforms with the updated features? No
[2121.12 → 2122.80] Easy, I enjoyed the game
[2123.28 → 2129.28] um, I enjoyed the so for those um, for those not familiar uh fantasia
[2130.08 → 2132.96] is a kind of under the radar
[2133.60 → 2134.80] um RPG
[2135.44 → 2142.08] that uh involved uh, I'm going to butcher the pronunciation, but uh, Harunobu Yamaguchi and
[2142.08 → 2143.76] Nob mats
[2143.76 → 2147.20] But basically like OG Final Fantasy
[2148.00 → 2151.68] um lead and OG Final Fantasy composer
[2152.56 → 2156.56] Is kind of all you need to know uh really, really unique
[2157.36 → 2161.68] Visual style so the environments instead of being rendered
[2162.40 → 2168.40] Oh man, this is horrible. Here we go. The environments instead of being rendered are handcrafted
[2168.40 → 2169.28] Dioramas
[2169.84 → 2171.12] that were then captured
[2172.56 → 2174.32] And then the um
[2175.28 → 2178.88] The rendered elements are cool. They are I like that art style it
[2178.88 → 2180.08] honestly
[2181.12 → 2182.40] Is enjoyable just
[2183.04 → 2184.08] Walking around
[2184.08 → 2186.16] Yeah in these environments. It's absolutely incredible
[2186.40 → 2191.28] I do wish that they weren't so limited by the hardware that they were running on because
[2191.28 → 2194.96] Uh, the game was an Apple Arcade exclusive for
[2195.84 → 2198.24] uh, I mean it's been at least a couple of years now
[2198.80 → 2202.40] and I was so excited about this game and
[2203.12 → 2204.32] that I was like
[2205.28 → 2209.28] on it like I rarely I'm like okay when's this game coming when's this game and then
[2209.28 → 2214.24] It's like oh, it's Apple Arcade exclusive. Oh, it's Apple Arcade exclusive basically forever. I
[2214.24 → 2221.76] Think this is the first time in my life that I have bought a console just to play a game
[2222.08 → 2226.40] I went, and I bought an Apple TV something or other Apple TV 4k or something like that
[2226.96 → 2230.88] I went to Costco. I bought a stupid Apple TV so I could sit and play this game
[2230.88 → 2236.40] This is the only thing you ever used it for it is the only thing I ever did with it, and it now is not even plugged in anymore
[2236.40 → 2243.92] uh, so I played through it and I loved how delightfully old school it was because
[2244.48 → 2251.84] It really was like a back to basics that the music's beautiful. The environments are beautiful. The combat is is is fun
[2252.16 → 2258.96] It's got this dimension system whereas you're walking around you get random encounters just like a classic RPG and there's
[2259.44 → 2261.68] Kind of too many of them just like a classic RPG
[2261.68 → 2268.64] But the main character has this device he carries with him that allows you to just cue up multiple random encounters
[2269.44 → 2270.88] So as you walk, it's just like
[2271.76 → 2275.28] You got a random one and the monsters just go into this like
[2275.84 → 2278.80] Weird alternate dimension, and then you can fight them all at once
[2279.52 → 2284.40] And it's kind of nice actually that makes some of the attacks that have like these long arcs or like these
[2285.12 → 2288.80] Shoot through abilities and stuff like that make more sense because instead of fighting
[2288.80 → 2297.52] You're fighting two to five at a time you're fighting like 20 to 40 at a time, and they like to spawn in as you kill them and stuff and uh
[2299.04 → 2302.48] I never really stopped enjoying the combat which was
[2303.04 → 2307.60] Pretty unusual for a RPG where a lot of the time it's just like okay. Well, I just
[2308.40 → 2311.12] Max out flare, and then I spend all my money on
[2311.76 → 2316.48] Like ethers and then who cares anymore? Like this is just this is just tedious
[2316.48 → 2324.08] Uh, yeah, at least the loading times are short because it's an old one on SNES or whatever like oh man playing on like the playstation 2 is painful
[2324.08 → 2325.04] Sometimes yeah
[2325.04 → 2328.08] Anyway, the point is that uh, the combat never really got old
[2328.40 → 2331.92] Um, I will say that there are some things that were less delightfully
[2332.80 → 2339.68] Retro like I I I wouldn't say that you know, I'm the kind of person that is gonna you know boycott a studio over uh
[2339.68 → 2341.68] over a less than modern
[2341.68 → 2345.44] representation of say for example women um
[2346.08 → 2348.08] But I will say that
[2348.08 → 2352.00] Even even to me, I was kind of like
[2353.52 → 2356.56] These women characters were written by men
[2358.64 → 2361.12] You know yikes like the level of
[2362.08 → 2364.72] I get it. He's a he's a studly guy
[2365.20 → 2371.52] You know the per the protagonist character that I get to you know player insert my myself into the role-playing
[2371.68 → 2373.68] You know roll
[2374.16 → 2378.24] um, you know, I get it, but the level of fawning here is uh
[2379.92 → 2380.24] Wow
[2381.60 → 2389.28] And to be clear it really isn't that different from the kind of media that you know the other side will consume right like
[2390.64 → 2394.32] The whole point of twilight is that kind of ordinary
[2395.28 → 2400.72] Young lady has these supernatural beings vying for her, you know, right like
[2401.52 → 2405.92] We get the same level of ridiculousness both ways, but it just felt a little
[2406.96 → 2410.56] Much for me in this particular in this particular game
[2410.88 → 2415.44] And they have a philosophy for boss fights that I think is both really cool and also kind of um
[2416.40 → 2417.20] kind of
[2417.20 → 2418.64] frustrating so
[2419.28 → 2422.56] In a boss encounter you kind of have to figure it out
[2423.20 → 2428.48] You can't just go in and hit with your hardest attacks and just and watch the attack pattern
[2428.48 → 2431.76] You really do need to change up your party a lot
[2432.40 → 2436.80] Like it's one of those games where if you've got a big roster, and you will use
[2437.36 → 2442.16] Almost all of them in every boss fight, or you're interesting, or you're pretty much doing it wrong. That's cool
[2442.16 → 2445.76] um, but what I found really frustrating was that
[2447.52 → 2449.68] You often wouldn't have time to figure it out
[2449.68 → 2456.64] It's one of those games where the only way to figure it out on a first play through is to read the strategy guide ahead of time
[2457.44 → 2464.16] And some of some of the things you would need to do would involve not just making sure you have the right characters in your roster
[2464.64 → 2469.60] But making sure that not only have you levelled them up suitably like that specific one
[2469.84 → 2473.68] But you've got like that specific branch of the tech tree to its credit
[2473.68 → 2479.92] You can respect your tech tree anytime you want, but there is a lot of micromanaging tedious and not just tedious
[2479.92 → 2482.88] but like and the creative thinking is kind of cool, but
[2483.68 → 2484.96] the way that
[2484.96 → 2487.28] um, the way that so many of the bosses can just
[2487.76 → 2494.80] One or two hit wipe you or just like, you know, three hit combo combo you no matter how many buffs you had um
[2496.56 → 2501.60] And how long the fights go so i I'm I'm I'm no I have no problem with it both ways
[2501.60 → 2506.24] Okay, give me a long-drawn-out tedious boss fight. I'll fight a boss for an hour
[2506.96 → 2508.48] No problem
[2508.48 → 2513.28] Or I will fight a boss where there's like a gimmick and once I figure it out
[2514.00 → 2516.00] Like it's over
[2516.00 → 2517.20] Don't give me both
[2517.20 → 2520.00] I don't want a gimmick that I have to grind through for an hour
[2520.56 → 2526.24] Oh, like there were some that were really quite like that and part of my problem is
[2526.24 → 2528.24] There's a part where your party gets split up
[2528.24 → 2533.44] And there were two that you're like supposed to find first but for whatever reason I didn't I found a bunch of the other ones first
[2533.68 → 2540.64] So they were way under levelled, and then I came up against a part in the game where there are a couple of boss fights that I really need them levelled up and etched up morph
[2541.28 → 2546.08] And it was really tedious to grind those levels because of the way the exp curve
[2546.32 → 2549.04] Works for what you're fighting and how much exp you get anyway, right?
[2549.04 → 2556.48] um, I made it I made it to the final of the like three or four stages or whatever it is of the final boss
[2557.28 → 2562.56] I died at that point. I had already been fighting him for like an hour and a half or something like that
[2562.56 → 2564.72] And I was just sitting here going like I get it
[2565.36 → 2568.00] I don't need to play the game again, but I also
[2568.64 → 2571.44] Would recommend it if you do enjoy classic RPGs
[2572.16 → 2574.56] I felt the game needed a little bit more play testing
[2575.36 → 2578.80] I think that part of it was just a philosophical difference. It's intended to be hard
[2579.28 → 2586.24] Do you think it is might this new version that came out might have addressed that it does it have like a normal
[2586.88 → 2588.88] which means Norrie
[2589.36 → 2590.88] difficulty mode
[2590.88 → 2592.96] So I think it's coming out for switch
[2592.96 → 2598.24] And then there was a steam dB entry for it a while back, but I actually don't know if they've made any announcements
[2598.88 → 2602.80] About it formally. So I don't know if it's actually coming to pc or not
[2605.36 → 2607.52] I forget what the question was I'm assuming
[2608.80 → 2613.28] I'm trying to look up the like YouTube announcement trailer. I'm assuming at the end it'll, it'll show
[2614.24 → 2618.16] The things it's launching on are you going to replay the game on different platforms? No
[2619.20 → 2623.44] Yeah, that like my saves on Apple Arcade, I guess so if I wanted to new game plus it
[2623.44 → 2629.04] I have no idea if I can export that I doubt it got another one for you here Linus my steam deck doesn't work
[2629.04 → 2631.04] There you go. You got mine
[2631.60 → 2632.72] There we go
[2632.72 → 2637.84] There deemed oh look at that switch PS5 PS4 Xbox Series X and s and steam
[2638.56 → 2641.84] Kind of crazy that they're doing this through square Unix
[2641.84 → 2645.20] Yeah, I think square Unix is helping with the porting don't quote me on that
[2645.68 → 2650.96] But um, my understanding was at some point there had been like some kind of falling out at some point
[2651.52 → 2656.80] um, so that's yeah, that's pretty, pretty wild life's too short for grudges man. Yeah, yeah
[2656.80 → 2661.68] Yeah, there's a quote from fallout new Vegas that I've always really liked. Um
[2662.80 → 2665.44] Oh, oh, oh, oh, I can't switch it back
[2666.32 → 2668.40] There we go. Yeah, that's okay. We share
[2670.72 → 2671.12] You know
[2673.92 → 2674.72] All right, where is it?
[2676.88 → 2682.16] No, no, no, no, I didn't want it on my screen. Uh lastly waging war against good people is bad for the soul
[2682.16 → 2687.28] This may not seem important to you now, but it's the most important thing I've said it's a good quote. Yeah, yeah, good quote
[2687.28 → 2694.64] Yeah, I like that. Yeah, I like that. I should uh, I should have my extended family play. Uh, what was it? Fallout New Vegas
[2694.64 → 2695.52] Fallout New Vegas, yeah
[2697.04 → 2699.60] That'd probably be kind of interesting. Let me get on that
[2702.72 → 2707.52] Oh boy, um, are we doing another merch message? I got another merch message. Sure. Yeah, we'll do one
[2708.00 → 2710.56] Hello guys, anode here. Oh
[2710.56 → 2716.88] Hard at work making the next game look good. Nice. Have you played the other titles before 1800?
[2716.88 → 2720.40] What was your favourite setting? Excited to get my hands on the screwdriver
[2721.60 → 2722.72] So
[2722.72 → 2723.92] Uh-oh
[2723.92 → 2725.76] Do you remember?
[2725.76 → 2728.16] You watched the Ludwig bro versus pro, right? Yeah
[2728.56 → 2733.20] Um, I actually I don't know if this made it into the cut for bro versus bro, but I didn't hear anything about ANO in it
[2733.20 → 2739.12] It no, no, not ANO related. Uh, it did make it into the uh episode of the yard that I was on
[2739.12 → 2742.24] Of course, wait, hold on. Sorry. Of course the ANO dev is watching now
[2743.04 → 2744.08] That makes sense
[2745.60 → 2751.60] Nice. Okay, sorry, keep going. Um, so I think it made it into the yard where I basically told him look
[2751.60 → 2752.96] I will play you
[2752.96 → 2758.48] Uh, any halo game as long as it's halo combat evolved or Halo Infinite, and he's like
[2758.48 → 2767.12] Why those two? I was busy. I was like because I've been because I was busy for a long time in between multiple kids and a company
[2767.60 → 2772.40] Things happen. I just had a lot. Yeah, and I was you know, I was in a very
[2772.96 → 2778.80] Whirlwind relationship even before that like, you know, I was pretty into Yvonne when I met her
[2779.12 → 2780.96] I thought she was pretty darn cool
[2781.44 → 2786.88] Um, so I spent a ton of pretty into her now. I'm pretty I'm pretty into her. Yeah, um
[2786.88 → 2793.20] Um, yep. Yeah, I'm she's great, you know, so I just I had a lot going on in between
[2793.44 → 2797.52] halo combat evolved and Halo Infinite and um
[2798.72 → 2802.48] Anna. Yeah, same story. I have played 1602 ad
[2803.04 → 2811.12] Which was the the the like western eye or well further Westernized name the north Americanised name
[2811.12 → 2817.36] Of Anna 1602, and then I have played Anna 1800 and that's it
[2817.36 → 2825.60] I I I briefly pirated the like futuristic one, and I only played it for I just didn't really understand
[2826.48 → 2827.52] how
[2827.52 → 2829.52] um, not obvious the grid was
[2830.24 → 2832.88] Like the building grid compared to 1602
[2832.88 → 2838.48] Yeah, and I didn't have a lot of time in those days that I wasn't busy playing left for dead 2 with my wife
[2839.04 → 2842.00] Um, and so I just I kind of dropped it immediately
[2842.64 → 2849.36] But I really enjoyed both of them and I really enjoyed the differentness of both of them
[2849.36 → 2855.92] Um 1602 had land battles. I don't know if you know that I did not they were kind of bad interesting. Um, and
[2856.00 → 2856.88] and
[2856.88 → 2863.28] And having played 1800. I don't even know that I would necessarily want that they weren't that practical because
[2863.84 → 2867.84] like men taking territory by land was
[2868.96 → 2869.92] so
[2869.92 → 2875.76] Expensive oh I'm sure because you could build instantly and there was no penalty for building
[2876.40 → 2881.44] Like next to an incoming army so you could just hoard a little bit of brick and cannon
[2882.00 → 2884.16] And then when they make landfall build towers
[2885.12 → 2886.40] Yeah, and just
[2888.16 → 2893.44] Annihilate whatever's there and then cannons like siege cannons were ridiculous
[2893.44 → 2899.36] Like you would want to have like a handful of cavalry, but then you would just have you would just like roll your cannon slowly across
[2900.08 → 2904.24] Assuming that they can't tower you, and then they would like one hit anything
[2904.72 → 2907.12] Like it was it was pretty broken
[2907.12 → 2914.08] It was a RTS made by people who have read about a RTS in a magazine once like it right no offence. Yeah, um
[2914.64 → 2917.84] 1800 is fantastic. We both really like it, but it was cool
[2918.24 → 2924.00] It was cool, and it was different and then Anna 1800 didn't have that at all and that was super cool
[2924.40 → 2930.40] And that was super different, and I love both of them in their own ways. I absolutely love them
[2930.40 → 2935.68] I forget what the question was had you played a previous Anna the only previous Anna that I had played
[2935.68 → 2937.92] was Anna 2070
[2938.48 → 2944.16] Okay, and I did not enjoy part of Anna though is having someone to kind of hold your hand
[2944.16 → 2947.60] I think so through the like so figuring out the economy and
[2948.32 → 2954.32] Figuring out trading I played 2070, and I was like this is a weird game and I don't like it and I'm never gonna
[2954.32 → 2956.72] Go back to Anna again, and then Linus was like
[2957.36 → 2959.36] Play 1800 with me or something
[2959.60 → 2961.92] And then I tried it, and I was like this game's actually really sick
[2961.92 → 2966.72] And now I even play it so single player every once in a blue moon. Yeah, it's oh, it's its so good
[2966.72 → 2975.76] Um, and man the soundtrack for 1602 absolutely slaps. Yeah, it's so good. I'm genuinely very excited for
[2976.32 → 2977.76] 117 the theme
[2977.76 → 2982.56] Yeah, I think it's going to be amazing
[2983.12 → 2984.56] Yeah, um
[2984.56 → 2989.76] I'm very excited and having like actually given 1800 a proper shot
[2990.24 → 2993.92] Because I bet you when I played 2070 I didn't really play for very long
[2993.92 → 2997.84] Yeah, I probably got it on like a humble bundle or something exact trying it out
[2998.40 → 3000.56] Um, it didn't really give it a fair shake
[3001.36 → 3004.00] Because I actually went back to it
[3004.00 → 3009.92] Recently really, really yeah just to give it a shot again or what because I was wondering like
[3010.80 → 3016.24] It's funny that this question came up because I was wondering what like my more recent thoughts would be about this game
[3016.24 → 3020.88] If I gave it an actual fair shake and I went back to it, and it's so old at this point that like
[3021.92 → 3026.96] It was a little rough. It's from 2011 the quality of life has improved a fair bit in
[3027.44 → 3032.88] 13 years, but I bet you if I gave it enough time I probably would have enjoyed that game
[3033.60 → 3039.68] But the concept of how it works was similar enough to 1800 that I was like 1800 is just
[3040.32 → 3046.80] Just a better game. I might as well go play that because it's not from 2011. Yeah, like it's not really a day gone
[3046.80 → 3047.84] 2070
[3047.84 → 3053.44] It's just I didn't feel a need to play that game. It had no nostalgia factor for me, but I was like, okay
[3053.44 → 3056.48] This was a good game. I just didn't give it enough of a chance
[3056.48 → 3063.44] Oh more topics sure we can do more topics Dan
[3064.08 → 3067.36] Nvidia becomes the most valuable company for a few days
[3068.08 → 3070.96] Immediately tries to strong-arm their enterprise customers
[3071.60 → 3080.40] Totally sounds right on Tuesday Nvidia became the world's most valuable company surpassing Microsoft and market cap as it passed apple a week before
[3080.40 → 3081.12] I
[3081.12 → 3083.12] Oh, man
[3083.12 → 3087.28] Riley puts in a little note here. Wow, I guess gamers must really be picking up a lot of GPUs
[3087.76 → 3088.00] Sorry
[3088.00 → 3090.48] Yeah, not not not even a little
[3091.04 → 3094.72] Perhaps in hopes that what goes up could just keep going up
[3094.80 → 3099.84] Nvidia is reportedly trying to pressure partners like dell hp enterprise and super micro
[3099.84 → 3105.60] Into buying complete server rack designs from Nvidia starting with the GB 200
[3106.08 → 3113.68] This would deprive these companies of the margin. They usually make from designing their own racks. We've heard that story before and that is why
[3114.72 → 3116.32] I don't actually know this
[3116.56 → 3118.56] But what I do know is
[3118.56 → 3120.56] Nvidia's manner of behaving
[3120.64 → 3125.20] And that is why VGA is no longer in the GPU business because NVIDIA
[3126.00 → 3127.04] slowly
[3127.04 → 3128.16] carefully
[3128.16 → 3130.16] Generation by generation
[3130.16 → 3137.92] Extracts more and more of the total value of every dollar coming in to anything that has anything to do with one of their solutions
[3138.40 → 3141.92] Until there is absolutely nothing left for their so-called partners
[3142.56 → 3148.64] um, they and I've I've told them this to their faces and they even have sponsored us recently
[3148.72 → 3150.72] I've told them they are the cheapest
[3151.60 → 3154.56] That I have ever worked with
[3155.12 → 3156.16] um
[3156.16 → 3157.20] Yeah
[3157.20 → 3159.20] Because they've been they've been
[3159.76 → 3164.80] Very rich for a very long time. It's just reached a whole new level lately, but they
[3166.48 → 3166.96] the
[3166.96 → 3167.04] the
[3169.04 → 3170.24] I don't know how difficult
[3170.80 → 3175.92] how difficult they can be sometimes in what I would consider to be
[3175.92 → 3177.04] um
[3179.84 → 3180.48] Partnership
[3180.48 → 3181.68] um
[3181.68 → 3182.48] um
[3182.48 → 3183.68] In a partnership relationship
[3183.68 → 3187.60] Yeah, it can be very challenging, and you know
[3187.60 → 3190.96] Don't imagine for a second that they're the only ones
[3190.96 → 3195.68] I think I just rag on them a lot because the disparity between
[3196.24 → 3196.64] um
[3197.28 → 3197.52] how
[3197.52 → 3199.28] how well they do
[3200.08 → 3200.24] and
[3200.24 → 3203.20] how hard it is to sort of
[3203.20 → 3209.20] It seems like the better they do, the more they want to be difficult to work with
[3209.76 → 3212.32] and I don't think I don't think it and
[3212.88 → 3216.80] I don't think all of I don't think it's wanting to be difficult to work with I think it's just
[3217.44 → 3218.32] um
[3218.32 → 3220.96] thinking and in many cases rightly
[3220.96 → 3224.80] That if you want to play with our ball, you're going to have to play with our rules
[3225.84 → 3226.48] I get it
[3227.12 → 3230.56] It's not like it's not an attitude that people can kind of understand
[3231.20 → 3235.12] It's like so I'm so I'm sorry you want to you want to build NVIDIA GPUs
[3235.52 → 3238.16] Well, like we have all the NVIDIA GPUs
[3238.16 → 3245.12] And if you don't like the way that you know, we do GPU partnership, you're more than welcome to go make art
[3246.88 → 3248.24] Right like it's not it's
[3248.88 → 3254.32] Yeah, they technically have competitors, but they don't really I'm sure it was going on before this
[3254.32 → 3257.92] What felt like the beginning of the end to me was when they started controlling how
[3258.56 → 3260.56] brands could do box art
[3262.08 → 3268.00] That was like a big sign of like oh boy, that was a public facing sign yes in the
[3268.00 → 3273.28] Background all kinds of other things were going on. I remember when hard OCP back in the day
[3273.92 → 3282.16] Blew the lid off of project green light where they were also controlling how their board partners could build the cards and validate the cards themselves
[3283.28 → 3289.84] One of the ones that drives me absolutely crazy. Do you know why the framework 16 has an AMD GPU?
[3291.76 → 3297.60] I've heard the story, but I don't remember I don't know this for sure because you know what to frameworks credit
[3298.16 → 3300.16] They don't tell me anything
[3300.72 → 3306.00] And I don't mean that no, I mean that in a good way. No, I was going to say like didn't you basically ask for that?
[3306.88 → 3307.12] um
[3309.52 → 3310.00] I guess
[3311.36 → 3317.20] Sort like indirectly whether I did or not though it wouldn't have mattered me asking for that was just a demonstration that were aligned
[3317.60 → 3322.08] um, but I actually I was chatting with the CEO at computer and
[3322.08 → 3325.28] uh, I was just ribbing him about something
[3325.28 → 3327.28] I can't remember what it was, but
[3327.28 → 3332.08] uh, basically I don't even know what my shares are worth, and so he was he was joking
[3332.08 → 3335.52] He was I was joking with him. I was like you don't tell you don't tell me anything man
[3335.52 → 3337.68] I don't I don't even know how much my shares are worth
[3337.68 → 3338.24] He's like, oh
[3338.96 → 3341.20] I can actually get you that I'm like no forget it
[3342.08 → 3343.84] It actually doesn't matter um
[3343.84 → 3350.72] Um, but the point is that anything that is bound by NDA he intentionally keeps me kind of at arm's reach
[3350.72 → 3351.36] Oh good
[3351.36 → 3357.20] Even compared to other investors in some cases because he recognizes that I'm a member of the media and even though
[3357.44 → 3363.44] He trusts me he recognizes that his agreement is that he won't talk to a member of the media about this
[3363.84 → 3367.68] So it doesn't matter if I also happen to be investor. He's just not going to do it
[3368.24 → 3371.20] And I respect that I actually really like that
[3371.76 → 3375.92] uh, because you know someone who like, you know, is trustworthy but like
[3377.04 → 3379.20] Tells you something it's not trustworthy, right?
[3379.20 → 3385.04] Yeah, so I legitimately do not know the answer to this question
[3385.60 → 3388.56] But what I do know is a lot of things about NVIDIA
[3389.04 → 3394.88] What I do know is a lot of things about how other partners have found working with NVIDIA
[3394.88 → 3398.80] Um, so what I will tell you is that my best guess
[3399.44 → 3406.40] This is a very educated guess my best guess is that the reason that the framework 16 has an AMD GPU
[3406.40 → 3415.12] And has no NVIDIA options whatsoever is that NVIDIA won't allow their partners to build a non-standard form factor GPU
[3415.92 → 3421.60] They don't care if the engineering is fine. They don't care if a customer wants it
[3421.60 → 3424.80] They don't care if there's more, you know
[3424.96 → 3425.28] uh
[3425.28 → 3431.04] Repairability and sustainability in this approach where you don't have to swap out your entire main board
[3431.28 → 3436.40] If something goes wrong with a know a GPU memory die, they don't care about any of that
[3436.40 → 3440.56] What they care about is controlling the ecosystem, and they have decided
[3441.12 → 3445.36] They've been man. They've been trying to kill mm for so many generations
[3445.36 → 3452.72] So that's that's the old kind of standard mobile GPU form factor that manufacturers like levo have been relying on for the like
[3452.88 → 3455.76] Big fat desktop replacement machines for many years
[3456.32 → 3457.60] um, but they've been trying man
[3457.60 → 3466.72] They've been trying to kill that forever and imagining for a second that NVIDIA is going to allow some you know new form factor to pop up is just
[3467.60 → 3468.56] I mean
[3468.56 → 3471.12] It's one of the things that I told framework when I
[3471.84 → 3474.88] First heard early rumours that they were working on a gaming laptop
[3474.88 → 3479.28] It's its one of the first things I told framework is like look. How are you guys going to do a GPU?
[3479.28 → 3481.20] Like I don't understand this product
[3481.20 → 3487.52] Um, and as it turns out they managed to get AMD to play ball or at least one of AMD's partners to just you know YOLO it and do it
[3487.52 → 3493.68] But NVIDIA's partners don't dare step out of line, and it's one of those things where like think about
[3494.32 → 3496.32] Think about if you met a couple
[3496.32 → 3496.64] Okay
[3498.08 → 3503.12] You don't have to see what he does to notice that his wife never speaks. Yeah
[3504.32 → 3504.80] You know
[3505.52 → 3511.12] Or like flinches at times little things like there's a lot of signs that can tell you kind of what's going on
[3512.00 → 3515.12] So the fact that none of NVIDIA's partners say anything
[3516.00 → 3519.44] Doesn't mean that everything's going great. Yeah. Um, yeah
[3520.48 → 3522.80] To be clear. That's a good point to be clear
[3522.80 → 3525.12] Our new contact there has been great
[3525.76 → 3528.72] We're back. There's we're back engaged with NVIDIA right now
[3528.72 → 3533.84] Just like every company there 's's perfect people there and there 's's really not
[3534.40 → 3540.56] But it's clear scales a lot. It's clear the relationship NVIDIA cares most about is the one with their shareholders
[3541.04 → 3543.04] And you know what to NVIDIA's credit
[3543.60 → 3546.48] They're doing real great by their shareholders right now. Oh, yeah
[3546.88 → 3549.44] They're I can't even man that stock split
[3549.44 → 3553.52] It dude at the rate it's continued to go up. I'm kind of sitting here going are we are
[3553.52 → 3555.28] We going to get above a thousand dollars again like
[3556.00 → 3561.36] What is going on here? Like I man, I don't own any NVIDIA, but I sure wish I did at this point good lord
[3562.32 → 3564.40] um
[3564.40 → 3565.68] Hopefully not for long
[3565.68 → 3569.36] Yeah, um, and we'll, we'll see if they tolerate me, you know saying this about them
[3569.36 → 3572.24] Sometimes I wonder because I know Jensen knows who I am
[3572.72 → 3577.36] Uh, like we've met before and stuff like that. Sometimes I wonder does he hear me talk about you know
[3577.60 → 3583.60] Nvidia's tight grip on its partnerships and does he go oh Linus is being mean to me or does he go?
[3584.48 → 3589.44] Linus gets it. That's how I do things. Yeah, I'm not sure if I genuinely suspect it's that
[3589.44 → 3593.36] He is's not like he shies away from being like
[3594.40 → 3601.12] Yeah, a strong leader, and you know what in a weird way. I kind of if he does own it like that. I
[3601.84 → 3603.84] Do respect that slightly more?
[3604.24 → 3607.04] Because it is worse in my opinion if like no
[3607.60 → 3615.44] No, I don't, and then you just do it anyway. Okay. Yeah, he owned it like that's still bad. I agree with you that hypocrisy
[3616.00 → 3622.16] Makes any crime worse. Yeah, I'm not saying it's a good thing. Yeah, yeah, but I do agree with you. Yeah
[3622.88 → 3625.52] hypocrisy makes any transgression
[3626.32 → 3628.80] Much, much more if he did watch this and was like yeah
[3629.52 → 3634.80] Yep, that's how we do it. That's how we that's how we've crushed it since I founded this company
[3634.80 → 3639.60] And that's how we're going to keep crushing it. We are you know, one of the world's most valuable companies
[3639.60 → 3643.52] We have like one product. Okay, they don't have one product, but they have
[3643.52 → 3650.40] GPUs and GPU accessories essentially right? Yeah, that Melanie acquisition man looking when I saw it
[3650.40 → 3653.92] I was like that seems pretty smart, you know data centre, you know communicate
[3654.48 → 3659.52] I didn't know where they were going with it. That was so much bigger than I realized. Yeah, dude
[3660.72 → 3662.56] Dude, he's got that vision. So
[3662.56 → 3671.04] When does NVIDIA just like acquire AMD?
[3671.92 → 3675.60] There's no way antitrust wise there's no way they could do it and sort of but like
[3676.96 → 3678.56] Nvidia plus AMD
[3679.76 → 3684.96] I feel like that's something that they super don't want to do. Oh, no, I don't think they want to do it
[3684.96 → 3687.12] They don't they don't actually want to be a monopoly
[3687.84 → 3692.32] But I'm imagining what a powerhouse that could be not that you know
[3692.32 → 3694.96] What maybe the x86 license just doesn't matter anymore though?
[3694.96 → 3698.24] Because that's the kind of thing that you used to kind of like think about five years ago
[3698.24 → 3700.96] It's like oh, yeah, man, like what if NVIDIA
[3702.16 → 3706.96] You had an x86 license because like how many years ago you think x86 has left on it
[3708.32 → 3709.60] Did you see framework?
[3709.60 → 3717.12] I'm, I'm so excited has a risk five board is it in the dock? I'm actually not sure if we can actually like to want to buy one
[3718.32 → 3722.72] I think it's more exciting to me than like a switches really it's so cool
[3723.04 → 3724.64] So I
[3724.64 → 3729.84] I asked framework because I like just asking questions. I know I'm not going to get an answer to
[3730.40 → 3735.28] I asked framework at computer if they had anything coming with the new Qualcomm chips because
[3735.84 → 3740.16] On the one hand, it's obviously a turning point for the pc industry
[3740.80 → 3746.24] We're turning in some direction here and I was, and actually I continue to be pretty jazzed about it. I'm
[3747.12 → 3753.76] There's going to be some there's some early growing pains for sure, but I'm I'm legitimately excited about windows on arm
[3754.32 → 3758.80] So I asked them I was like hey, are you guys going to have Qualcomm snapdragon x chips?
[3758.80 → 3759.36] um
[3760.16 → 3762.16] And they were like
[3762.16 → 3764.80] I guess you know, I can't answer that, and I was like, all right
[3765.44 → 3766.32] um
[3766.32 → 3770.72] But what they especially didn't answer was that they were just like
[3771.76 → 3772.72] you know
[3772.72 → 3776.72] leapfrogging going like oh man arm old news
[3777.28 → 3782.80] We're going to have our risk five board so sick. We have a topic in the dock for this framework risk
[3782.80 → 3791.92] Let's just do it now then and another risk five laptops to a company called deep computing is creating a framework laptop 13 main board powered by a
[3792.40 → 3794.48] Star 5 Jr
[3794.48 → 3795.12] 7
[3795.12 → 3797.52] 1 1 0 risk 5 processor
[3798.08 → 3800.08] It's a developer focused product
[3800.48 → 3803.76] Aided making tinkering with risk 5 more accessible
[3804.24 → 3810.96] Still it's one of the first instances of a consumer focused product built with the risk 5 which is why I in particular am excited
[3810.96 → 3814.00] Which FYI is a fully open architecture?
[3814.00 → 3818.08] So anyone can create their own processors without paying a fee so cool
[3818.08 → 3818.88] So cool
[3819.60 → 3827.52] But look there's another one to the size speed LMA compute module is a small board with a t
[3828.08 → 3829.04] head
[3829.04 → 3830.08] the
[3830.08 → 3836.88] 1520 risk 5 processors. I still like it better than Qualcomm's naming scheme. Yeah, these are both somehow better head
[3836.88 → 3839.68] Uh, t head is rough. What are you British?
[3845.04 → 3847.28] Oh, no, oh, man
[3849.44 → 3852.56] Anyway, you can get that t head processor in there
[3853.04 → 3854.96] Uh spiffing Brit in a computer
[3855.68 → 3861.28] That can be used to power various pc form factors like the lychee book 4a
[3861.28 → 3870.24] The discussion question is I lack any context necessary to understand the capabilities of these processors, but I'm sure they're pretty neat
[3871.28 → 3874.96] It's very cool that they're showing up in consumer products. That is really cool
[3874.96 → 3880.24] And I'm way more excited about them now that I've seen the accelerated
[3881.12 → 3884.00] uh trajectory of uh emulation
[3884.00 → 3892.32] Yeah, so yeah risk obviously risk 5 is is is not as simple as just taking your x86 code or your arm code and just
[3892.96 → 3897.92] You know plopping it on there, especially things as complex as operating systems and games
[3898.48 → 3898.96] um
[3899.76 → 3901.76] It's its going to be it's going to be slow
[3902.88 → 3907.84] But if we look at the accelerating rate of change
[3907.84 → 3914.00] So the like accelerating acceleration or whatever the point is
[3914.56 → 3918.56] No, no, that makes accelerating rate of change. Yeah, no, I know it makes sense, but it's just like
[3919.28 → 3920.48] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[3920.48 → 3929.92] If we look at the the the accelerating rate of change in development of emulation and in the portability of software and by
[3929.92 → 3933.84] By portability, I mean from platform to platform that really
[3933.84 → 3939.76] We have the iPhone to thank for
[3943.36 → 3945.20] Think about it. Yeah, I think I see it
[3946.88 → 3947.52] It's weird
[3948.32 → 3951.60] It's a weird thing to think about but if it wasn't for
[3952.48 → 3956.96] the iPhone would we have ever gotten a big enough platform
[3956.96 → 3957.60] platform
[3957.60 → 3961.76] That real developers like big developers
[3962.40 → 3963.12] Would have made
[3963.84 → 3965.84] team viewer and adobe
[3966.40 → 3970.64] Adobe creative apps and and and all these things even, even like being
[3971.28 → 3974.16] I mean, you can ssh into servers from your phone would there have
[3974.72 → 3978.40] I mean, you could do that. You could do that on you know, a blackberry or whatever
[3978.88 → 3980.56] But the difference but the difference
[3981.20 → 3983.36] Is that what apple built was momentum?
[3984.40 → 3986.48] They built an installation base
[3988.96 → 3993.52] That led to very significant development being done for arm
[3994.40 → 3999.20] that led to very significant work being done on porting
[3999.84 → 4002.00] applications from x86 to arm
[4002.40 → 4002.96] um
[4002.96 → 4005.52] So obviously this is not a solo effort thing
[4005.52 → 4011.28] But if we were going to look at sort of if we were trying to find a turning point, you know back to turning points again
[4012.08 → 4014.08] Man, the iPhone was such a moment
[4014.08 → 4016.08] um
[4017.68 → 4018.96] Freaking incredible
[4018.96 → 4025.68] um, and so-and-so looking at how long that transition took until we went oh, yeah, these arm chips are great
[4025.68 → 4027.68] Why don't we just you know put them in a laptop?
[4028.24 → 4032.24] And looking at your know, how far away we are probably from someone being like oh, well
[4032.24 → 4035.76] If it's great in a laptop, why don't we just throw it in a small form factor desktop?
[4035.76 → 4037.92] And then I think you can kind of see where we're going from there, right?
[4038.88 → 4044.08] Looking at how long that took and then looking at the momentum risk 5 has right now
[4044.24 → 4049.76] You know, we got a game running on like a random risk 5 motherboards with like an AMD GPU and it's running Linux, right?
[4049.76 → 4056.16] I did not know. Yeah, tanner got like trucker simulator running or something like that. So sick and it looked like but
[4057.28 → 4061.92] Yeah, it was terrible. It's so cool. But the fact that it ran yeah
[4061.92 → 4064.16] Yeah
[4064.24 → 4068.16] This is this it's happening right now man. It's its it's exciting
[4068.48 → 4074.32] Um, and I think it's super cool that framework investment disclosure not that I haven't talked about it plenty on the show so far today
[4074.56 → 4078.40] I think it's super cool that framework is ending up, you know
[4079.60 → 4085.76] In as part of this transition. I mean they didn't make the board themselves, but like they're they're a platform
[4085.76 → 4090.32] I guess if you want to make they're an enabler if you were going to make
[4090.96 → 4092.48] a motherboard
[4092.48 → 4097.68] Thinking oh, yeah, I needed I need a mother. I'm going to make them. Furthermore, I'm going to make a laptop motherboard
[4098.32 → 4101.76] And I want there to be some hope that there's an installation base
[4102.32 → 4104.32] For people to put it in
[4104.72 → 4109.04] Yeah, who else but framework? Yeah, I didn't even wait. Maybe I did think of that
[4109.28 → 4113.92] But it's not something I've thought about in a long time the idea of third parties
[4114.64 → 4116.80] Creating motherboards for framework laptops
[4116.80 → 4122.32] I wonder how hard it would be
[4123.20 → 4125.28] To do this is interesting
[4126.08 → 4130.80] You know that like, uh, you know someone like an Asus or like a total or whatever, you know
[4130.80 → 4136.96] They do board designs like all the time for GPS that just never make it to market because NVIDIA won't green-light it, or you know
[4137.28 → 4143.28] Whatever else. Um, I wonder how hard it would be to make like a 40
[4143.28 → 4145.76] 60 mobile GPU
[4146.40 → 4148.16] Like to just get one made
[4149.68 → 4152.00] Like if I just bought a 40 60 like
[4153.04 → 4156.72] desktop card or if I bought a lap like a 40 60 laptop
[4157.60 → 4162.40] Like I actually wonder obviously I couldn't do it myself. You need like design docs and stuff like that
[4162.64 → 4165.84] But I wonder if I could find someone who would stealthily
[4165.84 → 4167.44] There's no way it would be affordable
[4167.44 → 4171.28] But that would be a banger video. How crazy would that be if I was like
[4171.28 → 4173.28] Like there is no reason
[4173.92 → 4174.88] NVIDIA couldn't
[4176.00 → 4180.72] Make a framework GPU, and we like went to someone and like quietly made one, and we're just like
[4181.36 → 4181.84] like look
[4182.56 → 4186.08] I I'm sworn to secrecy. I won't, I won't tell NVIDIA who made it for me
[4186.08 → 4187.84] I wonder if you could work with strange parts
[4188.72 → 4188.96] um
[4189.76 → 4190.80] probably
[4190.80 → 4194.80] Probably we wouldn't need to not not that I wouldn't be down love Scotty
[4194.80 → 4195.84] Yeah, um
[4195.84 → 4201.68] But the way to get it done would probably just be to go to a partner directly and we know the major board guys like
[4202.72 → 4203.44] It should be fine
[4205.28 → 4209.84] That'd be so cool. That'd be pretty sick. Uh, no key says I mean it is possible. Yeah, exactly
[4210.48 → 4214.08] Most of the board is just a bunch of power regulators and mini caps and resist yeah
[4214.08 → 4219.20] We know it's we know it's possible like yeah. Oh, 100 100 possible. It's just you know
[4219.20 → 4226.80] Not exactly within our capabilities I'm assuming at least who knows no these days. It's not yeah
[4229.36 → 4235.52] We awesome we got some fancy people here though. Oh, kingpins apparently at any now. Yeah. Oh, wow. Okay
[4236.40 → 4238.24] Speaking of people who know a lot about board design
[4240.00 → 4241.68] Cool. All right, what's up? What's up next?

[4424.80 → 4431.60] Is it service or system some of my talking points today are pretty broken? I'm not going to buy
[4433.28 → 4438.32] System, okay, it is system. Wow. That's that's that's great. Anyway, it's a tool that turns

[4489.20 → 4493.44] We moved the show up by like six and a half hours or something like that today
[4493.44 → 4496.48] So people didn't have their normal amount of time to prep things, but uh
[4497.12 → 4502.64] Yeah, I think the think the sponsor talking points did not get the usual once over
[4502.64 → 4512.16] Got some merch messages for you sure hit me Dan actually this one's for Luke not you. Oh, fine. Hello, Wanda DLL question for Luke
[4512.24 → 4517.04] Any fun stories from open sauce get a chance to meet up with nerd forge or other creators?
[4517.28 → 4521.04] I drive by the cow palace every day, but sadly couldn't make it myself
[4521.76 → 4527.36] Cow palace was cool. That was a good venue for it. Uh, I did meet up with nerd forge. They were awesome. I had never met them before
[4527.36 → 4530.56] Oh, so cool. I wasn't in office when they did the thing cool
[4531.20 → 4533.76] Very cool people was very happy. I got to meet up with them
[4534.00 → 4537.04] I got to meet up with a bunch of other creators as well, which was fantastic
[4537.60 → 4539.60] um
[4540.32 → 4546.80] Probably the coolest individual moment. Did you see the yard boys? Yeah, I got to meet them for the first time too, which was cool
[4547.36 → 4548.48] um
[4548.48 → 4552.16] The coolest moment was when Adam savage said his thing
[4552.16 → 4558.80] Um, when he saw the screwdriver the stubby so we brought the like three well, we uh
[4559.36 → 4565.52] Sebastian and tine and brought the 3x stubby. Oh, they're from the creator warehouse engineering team. Yeah, and uh
[4566.16 → 4571.84] Adam savage was very happy to see it. Yeah, Sebastian was telling me he's like it was pretty cool
[4572.40 → 4576.32] Just like you did it. Yeah, and you did it. Yeah, it's cool
[4576.32 → 4581.36] There's a whole circle of people, and he spotted it like through the circle and then and then got all excited
[4581.52 → 4588.40] Apparently, he loves the screwdriver, which I'm finding out for the first time, which is super cool. Yeah. Yeah, massive very much
[4588.40 → 4591.60] So massive kudos to the team. Yeah, I
[4592.72 → 4598.56] I was thinking like okay, it's because my understanding of why like I form lines at Ltd is
[4599.28 → 4603.76] Just really hardcore fans go to Ltd and really hardcore fans watch wan show
[4603.76 → 4607.44] So I don't really show up in much other content and haven't for years
[4608.72 → 4615.60] No, but there also are old like kind of evergreen videos with you that have millions and millions of views and there's some residual
[4615.92 → 4619.92] Like oh, yeah, that guy I went to open sauce and was like
[4620.00 → 4625.04] I'm going to do a couple panels, and it'll be cool to like go see the show. No one's really going to know who I am
[4625.52 → 4627.76] I made it one booth onto the floor
[4628.40 → 4632.96] And had a line for three and a half hours and then someone had to pull me out of it so I could go to a panel
[4632.96 → 4636.88] And then that happened again
[4637.76 → 4638.16] Nice
[4638.16 → 4641.52] I got to see two booths because it was the first booth
[4641.52 → 4648.56] I saw one time and then the first booth I saw another time and then the whole rest of the show was the whole thing is like it's that crowd though, right? Like
[4649.28 → 4650.56] low-key
[4650.56 → 4653.68] You and your team run one of the mean
[4654.32 → 4661.52] Maybe not, you know, maybe not top 10 but certainly top 100 like video platforms like on the internet
[4662.40 → 4664.96] Flow plane there was a surprising amount of people
[4665.60 → 4669.76] That when you know you like maybe ask a couple questions and stuff when you say hi
[4670.24 → 4676.08] That we're talking about like the engineering behind full plane. Yeah, and it's interesting. I don't mean by necessarily
[4676.48 → 4682.16] Yeah, I don't I don't necessarily mean by you know the number of creators on it because we aren't top anything for that
[4682.16 → 4686.88] We don't we only have a small handful on there, but in terms of bandwidth served
[4687.44 → 4692.00] Um, it's actually decently high flow plane is like a decent sized platform
[4692.56 → 4697.28] Um, and you're you and your team are like what 10 people at this point
[4697.52 → 4699.28] You want to flow plane a lot less than that?
[4699.28 → 4703.68] Oh, yeah, that's that's true the ones that actually are dedicated to flow plane. It's more like five so
[4703.68 → 4707.36] Yeah, yeah, and one of them is only like halftime
[4707.68 → 4713.04] So yeah, I mean that's that's something that this crowd would think is super cool
[4713.04 → 4714.80] Yeah, we had a lot of conversations about that, too
[4714.96 → 4717.44] I had a couple of people that guessed how many people were on the team, and they were like
[4718.16 → 4720.32] Like 10x the amount that it actually is
[4720.88 → 4726.08] Um, it's a perfect. It's an awesome team. Furthermore, it was a very, very cool event. Um
[4727.04 → 4730.48] The panels are the recordings anywhere. I think so actually
[4730.48 → 4733.04] I think you might have to pay to access them. I'm not sure
[4733.52 → 4737.20] Um, but yeah, the William Osman and his team did a fantastic job
[4737.76 → 4742.16] As far as I know, this is only the second one, and it doesn't show you'd have no idea
[4742.16 → 4744.64] This was the second one. It feels like a fairly mature show
[4745.20 → 4746.32] We should have them do our shows
[4748.32 → 4752.32] There was there were some takeaways in regard to like if we do another Ltd again
[4752.32 → 4754.24] There are things that they did that were perfect
[4754.40 → 4757.52] There's also things about Ltd that I think might have been a little bit better
[4757.52 → 4762.48] Um, there was there were positives and negatives all over the place, but open sauce was a
[4762.96 → 4767.60] Really, really cool event not only did they have the main stage in the secondary stage
[4767.60 → 4772.72] So they had a lot of panels that you'd be able to go to but the creator museum
[4773.52 → 4777.28] Was such a cool idea where like I'm sure
[4777.92 → 4784.56] Someone on the team organizing the event understands that a lot of the people that would be interested in going to that event are
[4785.20 → 4790.08] creators and makers of some form whether they are creators and makers that post YouTube videos or not
[4790.32 → 4795.52] Who knows, but they're creators and makers so they had this idea of the creator museum, and you could bring
[4796.24 → 4798.24] Pieces to just show people
[4798.64 → 4803.04] Um, and I believe the creator museum was not a paid placement thing
[4803.76 → 4806.72] That's super cool. It's like I just have something neat. I want people to be able to see it
[4806.72 → 4808.40] You could just have a little area
[4808.40 → 4812.40] Um, and they had tons of stuff in there that was fascinating that I didn't really get to see
[4812.40 → 4817.52] But I heard through the grapevine there were fascinating things. Uh, like one was a shrimp that fries rice
[4820.96 → 4829.20] So it used like a camera to track the shrimp like an actual around a fake submerged little kitchen
[4829.20 → 4832.80] And then it would like, uh, I think recreate the movement in like a
[4833.68 → 4836.72] Walk thingy that's frying the right like just hilarious
[4836.72 → 4838.72] It's maker stuff
[4839.28 → 4846.40] Um, I yeah, I don't know really cool event tons of really cool things to see if you follow maker creators
[4847.04 → 4850.72] Or tech creators or whatever on YouTube a lot of their stuff was there
[4851.28 → 4856.32] People would bring like these cool projects that they spent like months making, and they'll just bring it, and you can
[4856.96 → 4862.64] Touch it and use it and in some cases like ride around on it because there was like rideable that people had just made
[4862.64 → 4868.24] So cool super, super cool really, really cool event. So I don't know if you're interested go next year. It's fantastic
[4868.24 → 4872.00] Hopefully, I'll be there and I'm trying to convince some more people on the team to come down. So
[4872.88 → 4878.64] Yeah, I'm taking vacation next year. Nice. I'm definitely going it was really you would really like it
[4878.64 → 4884.00] I would have been following basically everyone there for forever. Yeah, amazing. It was great
[4884.56 → 4887.52] Um next up. This is a question I've been getting a lot actually
[4887.52 → 4893.28] Do you plan bringing back the older water bottle colours, which previously existed?
[4894.40 → 4895.76] Uh, I have no idea
[4896.72 → 4901.60] I'm going to be honest with you. I don't really know why we don't have any water bottles in stock
[4901.60 → 4902.80] I think it was a whole
[4903.44 → 4910.96] Like we were trying to we were trying to get our stocking strategy sort of figured out, and then we like didn't place orders for a bit
[4910.96 → 4916.56] And then maybe fulfillment was slow. I actually have no idea what's going on with water bottles. You might have to forward that one
[4916.56 → 4918.56] We do have some
[4920.96 → 4926.32] Just reducing some of the colours do we yes, we have some oh wow, we have very few colours
[4926.96 → 4932.40] Yeah, I believe colours are colours were limited down, but we have the classic we have the stealth
[4932.80 → 4939.20] We have the black and gold we have the black white and black, and then we're sold out on the Atlantic blue
[4939.28 → 4943.36] Okay, but we used to have like a ton of other whack ton of colours
[4943.36 → 4948.96] Do we also have one of the capacitor ones these are so fun these don't sell?
[4950.16 → 4955.52] Like they do but like at a trickle the capacity it took it's a big capacitor
[4956.08 → 4959.36] It looks like a big giant capacitor on your desk. How do you not love it?
[4960.56 → 4964.40] Anyway, oh, do we have any like store news or anything like that?
[4964.40 → 4968.48] Oh, there's something under your desk. Oh my god, we're finally launching this
[4968.88 → 4972.08] How did I not talk about this in like the first five minutes of the show?
[4972.08 → 4974.24] It's under your desk. Are you taking it home?
[4974.80 → 4980.16] I already have one that makes sense because of course I do I'm getting a cat on Monday. Oh, you are yeah
[4980.64 → 4981.28] Oh
[4981.28 → 4986.88] Congrats, right? You're like yeah. Yeah, I remember that. Okay. Yeah
[4986.88 → 4994.24] I just I don't know. I want to say it's vague and ambiguous. Don't continue. Yeah, all right. Yeah, that's fine
[4994.24 → 4996.24] Yeah, we're good. It's fine. Just fine. Yeah
[4997.12 → 4998.88] This is it
[4998.88 → 5001.28] The retro monitor pet cave
[5003.20 → 5005.84] How cute is it look how cute it is
[5006.40 → 5015.04] It's a little CRT monitor. That's a little cat or dog bed and uh, and Lloyd made it look like a little monitor
[5015.04 → 5018.64] Look, it has little ports and has a little as a little
[5019.20 → 5025.12] C13 power connector and I forget what this barcode does. Can you scan that probably Rick rolls you?
[5025.12 → 5028.56] I don't know. Oh, and then on the inside. It's its static
[5031.28 → 5037.92] Okay, it's got a little dial interface. That's pretty good. It's a little CRT monitor and oh
[5038.08 → 5041.68] Oh, and it's very come and thoughtfully designed as always
[5041.68 → 5045.84] Oh smart. So the pillow is removable in case you your cat, you know
[5046.96 → 5049.52] It looks like a minecraft shirt in continent
[5050.00 → 5055.44] Um, and also this side. Okay. Okay. Hold on touch it. No, no, not with your hand
[5056.00 → 5056.80] No, no, no, no
[5056.80 → 5062.64] With his hand. Uh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead and go ahead and touch it. Yeah
[5063.20 → 5066.96] Is it soft? It is soft. It's soft. Okay. Okay. Now touch this side
[5066.96 → 5070.40] That is less soft. Yeah, okay. I feel like if I
[5071.36 → 5072.24] But that's by design
[5072.80 → 5076.88] So posited liquid on it. It would go well. Yeah. Well, no, no, no, no. It's not waterproof
[5077.52 → 5081.04] But what it is um is less hair
[5081.76 → 5086.16] Ah, nice. Okay, so depending on like what type of cat or dog you have
[5086.16 → 5092.24] You might want to flip it. Yeah, so you can flip it depending on what's better for kind of your situation
[5092.48 → 5098.56] And it has a convenient zipper to pull out the pillow, and you can wash this separately, or you know
[5098.88 → 5103.44] If it comes down to it, you could just restuff it with you know something else if uh
[5104.00 → 5105.92] Which it might which might happen
[5106.48 → 5108.48] um
[5109.28 → 5111.92] It has little uh little grippy dots on the bottom
[5112.72 → 5113.52] but
[5114.96 → 5120.64] Kind of try and catch the light here. Yeah, it has little grippy dots on the bottom so it won't, you know accidentally scoot around and
[5121.76 → 5122.96] You know why this took so long?
[5124.32 → 5125.84] Packing
[5125.84 → 5130.64] Figuring out how to fold it down. Yeah, this is what collapse it. Yeah, it comes collapsed
[5130.80 → 5133.76] So this is what it looks like right when you pop it out
[5133.76 → 5138.16] And if you want you can steam it, and you can get it like looking real clean, right?
[5138.16 → 5143.28] Right, but the initial packing solution from these guys it would come out looking just terrible
[5143.28 → 5148.64] And we wanted the unboxing experience to be a lot better. Good. Yeah, so figuring out how to nail this down was
[5151.60 → 5153.60] Everything
[5153.68 → 5158.80] everything takes us like three times longer because we're obsessive
[5158.80 → 5164.96] Uh, how sturdy is the top? Oh guys, it's its it's its like
[5165.68 → 5172.00] Collapsible like a cat is not sitting on the top. It's its for going inside. They'd probably enjoy jumping on it and getting enveloped
[5172.88 → 5175.68] Maybe not the first time. Yeah, definitely not the first time
[5176.64 → 5178.64] Anyway, it's 49.99
[5179.28 → 5181.44] Hey, my birds could stand on it, and it wouldn't collapse
[5181.84 → 5185.12] And I guess I covered all the other talking points on my own
[5185.12 → 5192.08] I get your pet off your pc setup and into their own is apparently our tagline for this thing. Let's go ahead and
[5193.12 → 5198.64] How cute is that picture? That is ridiculously cute. Oh, I love it

[5224.32 → 5227.36] So much better. Why aren't there more cute cat pictures though?
[5227.36 → 5229.36] No
[5233.92 → 5238.80] Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I think there's an oh oh oh interesting. This is some more news
[5238.80 → 5243.92] Yeah, this is not Ltd store related, but we are doing a garage sale for the first time in
[5245.20 → 5249.20] Nine years eight years. Can I go buy stuff? I don't see why not
[5249.92 → 5252.88] July 6th from 10 a.m to 2 p.m
[5253.12 → 5255.04] At the Ltd labs building
[5255.84 → 5261.52] We have 400 plus items. We have keyboards mice headsets speakers computer components
[5262.08 → 5268.40] ltdstore.com items will not be available for purchase. We do not have inventory of that here
[5268.64 → 5272.40] This is just a garage sale of just random stuff. We need to get rid of
[5272.40 → 5278.56] Um, you must park on the street somewhere or Uber or something
[5278.56 → 5283.68] We don't have parking for you. So you'll have to go on Google Maps and the parking on the street is rough
[5284.00 → 5287.84] It's terrible to be prepared to walk be prepared to hike. Yes, um
[5288.40 → 5296.24] And it is credit debit only we are not going to be taking cash. So there you go guys garage sale. Uh, it's coming July 6th
[5296.24 → 5306.00] Um, yeah, I guess staff can buy stuff. It's its probably going to be like reverse auction style kind of like we did it last time
[5307.12 → 5309.68] So you know how an auction you start low and just go up high
[5310.16 → 5315.92] So this in this case, I think we'll probably start with I'll probably I'm probably going to be like running a lot of it
[5316.16 → 5318.88] And I'll just be like, I don't know. I think this is worth 20 bucks
[5319.44 → 5321.44] Oh, I can also just do that if you want, uh
[5322.56 → 5322.88] 12
[5322.88 → 5326.32] Who wants it? What would be kind of funny? Yes
[5327.92 → 5332.80] I can't, I could help you run that and then if prices of certain things get low enough. I'll just be like well
[5334.16 → 5336.16] I'll take it
[5337.04 → 5339.04] Just leave your credit card with Yvonne. Yeah
[5340.48 → 5342.88] Swipe it I'm putting this one in the back
[5345.60 → 5351.36] All right, that's uh people are asking is it worth flying here? I know I mean no
[5351.36 → 5358.40] The amount you're going to spend on the plane ticket. Yeah, is going to make the discount on the items. Yeah, just buy yourself a stick of ram
[5358.64 → 5360.88] Yeah, like you're good. You're good. You're good, buddy
[5361.84 → 5363.84] That's not how you bargain shop
[5364.40 → 5365.84] Yeah
[5365.84 → 5368.16] Let me fly somewhere and get a hotel and rent a car
[5370.96 → 5372.88] Okay, I mean, you know people like
[5373.52 → 5376.40] Do travel for shopping sometimes. Yeah, but not for like
[5376.40 → 5380.08] That I'm just saying I'm just saying it's totally a thing
[5380.72 → 5386.56] I don't know. I get a kick out of it when people are buying like commodity stuff. They're like, oh, yeah, I'm buying jewellery. I'm like
[5388.48 → 5391.12] The price of gold is the same everywhere in the world
[5391.84 → 5393.52] What are you what are you talking about?
[5394.32 → 5396.80] Yeah, anywho? Yeah, all right
[5396.80 → 5401.68] I got a couple more for you here unless you want to save them for later up to you. Yeah, let's save them for later
[5401.68 → 5405.92] I think sounds good. I think we might sell a few retro monitor pet caves now
[5406.88 → 5407.68] Yeah
[5407.68 → 5414.32] Yeah, they were not registering on the most popular item list, and now they are number three soon to be number two with the way that things are going
[5414.88 → 5417.36] So, uh, let's go retro monitor pet cave
[5418.00 → 5419.36] Let's go
[5419.36 → 5421.36] Uh, all right topic. What do you want to do?
[5421.36 → 5429.52] Our I think our last title topic main topic call out topic whatever SoftBank developing real-time emotion cancelling tech
[5429.52 → 5432.96] Okay, this is the smartest use of AI that I have seen yet
[5433.84 → 5438.88] Yeah, I think people are going to work around it, but yeah, actually how will they work around it?
[5439.68 → 5440.56] I
[5440.56 → 5444.64] Will I'll get to that. All right, fine. Japanese well only sort of work around it
[5444.96 → 5452.96] Japanese tech giant SoftBank has announced it is working on emotion cancelling AI technology that alters the tone and pitch of angry customers in real time
[5453.20 → 5455.20] Making them sound calmer
[5455.52 → 5462.56] When they call customer service representatives the project is designed to protect workers from customer harassment a press
[5463.04 → 5469.20] Oppressing issue in many places, but one that's referred to specifically in Japan as Sahara
[5470.16 → 5472.40] Which just sounds like customer harassment, but
[5473.20 → 5480.00] Not English, uh, but it doesn't change the words being spoken and for service reps being told to de-escalate angry customers
[5480.00 → 5486.64] Not getting the full context of what's being said might make that job harder one Redditor argues
[5486.64 → 5491.28] This is treating a symptom rather than the cause likening it to Foxconn factory
[5491.84 → 5498.80] To a Foxconn factory in China responding to distraught workers throwing themselves out of windows by surrounding the building with nets back in 2017
[5500.16 → 5502.88] I don't think it's that I think that's a pretty drastic yeah
[5502.88 → 5507.20] I don't agree with that comparison at all. I think that some people are just
[5507.84 → 5509.36] Jerks yep, and
[5510.24 → 5513.04] If is you could just if you could just
[5513.76 → 5519.52] Make a customer service agents day a little bit less unpleasant that sounds great. I don't think you're going to be missing
[5520.24 → 5525.36] I don't think you're going to be missing any context you would need oh, no, I'm I'm worried
[5525.36 → 5527.44] the only thing I'm worried about is that if
[5527.44 → 5534.32] This if the knowledge of this thing existing becomes widespread people are going to become more colourful with their language to compensate
[5534.32 → 5534.72] I
[5534.72 → 5538.40] I doubt it. Yeah, I think especially when people are angry
[5538.80 → 5541.12] They're gonna talk in if anything
[5541.84 → 5546.88] A more natural way they start getting into like almost autopilot rage mode. Yeah
[5547.60 → 5551.60] No, I actually strongly disagree. I think that this is a win
[5552.16 → 5553.92] I think that oh, no, I think it's a good thing
[5553.92 → 5557.12] I'm, just worried people are going to try to work around it and
[5557.84 → 5560.16] Use worse language, but overall, I think it's a good thing
[5560.16 → 5565.52] Yeah, I don't think people I don't think the average person calling a customer support line and yelling at someone
[5566.16 → 5572.32] Is going to be that smart like coherent enough to do that. I I I have this theory that a lot of anger
[5572.80 → 5576.08] Is actually not anger. It's just misunderstanding
[5576.32 → 5579.76] I think that if we understood a situation
[5579.76 → 5583.44] There are many times when it wouldn't be as
[5583.44 → 5588.96] Necessary to be angry about it think about the average customer support ticket though, Luke
[5589.28 → 5595.84] I'm not talking about being angry. Okay, okay about inequality in the world in the realm of customer
[5596.56 → 5601.84] Okay, I mean just it just the kind of like the stuff I've had to see Joe deal with
[5601.84 → 5609.60] Exactly, exactly right and to be clear the vast majority of tickets he deals with are fine
[5609.60 → 5613.36] Of course, it's just every once in a while stuff. That's just like what exactly going on
[5613.44 → 5620.72] So if we think about when I talk about anger, I don't mean I don't mean like a deep a deeply held belief
[5621.20 → 5625.68] In fairness that the world is not you know living up to
[5625.68 → 5629.44] I'm not that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about like
[5630.72 → 5632.72] you know, just uh, I
[5634.72 → 5635.76] My
[5635.76 → 5636.72] phone's
[5637.76 → 5639.76] Glass is broken
[5640.88 → 5644.08] Maybe if I didn't do that to it, you know, my glass might not be broken, right?
[5644.08 → 5646.08] He actually hooked it at the crowd
[5647.52 → 5649.52] phonies
[5650.32 → 5655.36] That was real like I'm talking about I'm talking about that kind of
[5655.68 → 5658.24] Of just like irrational anger
[5658.88 → 5664.08] Right where realistically if you stopped and slowed down and thought okay
[5664.08 → 5666.24] What is the cause of this situation?
[5666.24 → 5669.36] I'm finding myself in it might be that I'm not careful
[5670.16 → 5673.12] It might be that I need to do a little bit of introspection
[5673.76 → 5681.36] I also think a lot of the time that if you're calling in and raging at customer support, which is not okay for a variety of reasons
[5681.36 → 5688.32] I'm sort of almost hoping that a lot of you the rest of your day was like terrible, and it's just being
[5689.12 → 5694.16] Yeah, this is like a venting situation, which is not how you should do that but like
[5695.20 → 5702.24] Yeah, so, so anyway, I think I think a lot of I think a lot of anger is just being um
[5704.00 → 5704.56] kind of dumb
[5704.56 → 5713.52] Or like emotionally when you're yelling at the YouTube people on the phone then which YouTube people
[5713.60 → 5715.12] Haven't you done that before?
[5715.12 → 5715.84] Yell at them?
[5715.84 → 5718.00] Yeah, or wait right angry emails, I guess
[5718.72 → 5721.84] I mean I've certainly written irate emails
[5724.16 → 5727.84] But a lot of the time the thing that I am the thing that I am
[5728.72 → 5729.68] frustrated by
[5729.68 → 5732.88] Is pretty justifiable?
[5733.44 → 5737.52] Okay, like so when you write irate emails, it's not here. Well, do you want me to?
[5737.76 → 5743.76] Oh, absolutely. Oh, I never said I'm not dumb sometimes. Okay, I wear the oh dude. I wear that on my sleeve
[5744.56 → 5747.20] I'm not perfect. Yeah, I'm not perfect
[5749.04 → 5755.60] But I think there's a big difference between the kind of temper tantrums that this is designed to mitigate versus like
[5755.60 → 5757.60] Yeah, yeah
[5757.60 → 5758.00] Yeah, um
[5758.88 → 5762.72] So so I don't think it changes the point that like that sort of just
[5763.36 → 5770.72] You know not understanding because a lot of the time what people are mad about is they like they don't understand that paying for express
[5771.04 → 5771.92] shipping
[5771.92 → 5774.80] doesn't mean that someone was standing there like
[5775.68 → 5778.72] Looking at the incoming orders and like being like okay
[5778.72 → 5782.80] There it is in the morning throwing it in a box at three in the morning on a Saturday
[5783.52 → 5787.20] Right, it just means that once we hand it to the shipper it will go
[5788.08 → 5793.28] That leg of the journey faster, right faster. We would run into that at NCI all the time people be like
[5793.92 → 5800.48] Express shipping says two to four days. It's been five days. We're like you place sir sir
[5801.36 → 5804.72] Sir you place it at 11 59 on Friday
[5805.52 → 5809.04] Okay, we sir sir sir. We don't work we could sir
[5809.04 → 5814.96] I'm going to have to ask it sir. Please calm down right and oh here's a question
[5814.96 → 5818.64] Yeah, do you think it's going to run all the time or do you think it's going to detect?
[5820.00 → 5825.04] Oh, I think it would almost certainly detect because I think if it ran all the time that would kind of suck
[5825.60 → 5828.16] Because if you're just listening to like monotone robot voice
[5828.16 → 5830.72] No, I think it literally all day if is it works well
[5831.20 → 5833.60] It would detect when someone kick in yep
[5833.60 → 5838.08] And people are saying like people will change their language to be more colourful to make their point
[5838.24 → 5842.48] I think there's no reason it couldn't detect that too. Oh, sure. Yeah, just like it says
[5842.48 → 5846.24] It's not gonna change the worst. Oh, it could bleep though. It could bleep swear words sure why not? Yeah
[5847.44 → 5851.44] I mean, I think this, so this will create like almost more fun water cooler talk
[5851.44 → 5856.88] I think it would be pretty entertaining to be the team in charge of creating the list of words and phrases that are going to be bleeped
[5856.88 → 5864.72] It's like man, I'm so wow that's fascinating. We're allowed to discuss this right now. I
[5867.04 → 5874.16] I just I love the water cooler talk idea of just like man. I had the craziest emotion cancelled today. The guy was going off
[5877.04 → 5879.04] Oh, I love that
[5879.44 → 5883.60] Pretty sure there's already a good dictionary for that says Omega total yeah urban dictionary.com
[5884.40 → 5886.40] Everyone knows urban dictionary.com
[5886.88 → 5889.12] Man, man
[5889.12 → 5892.32] I had a boomer say sweet to me the other day
[5893.76 → 5898.16] Is that coming back? I don't think so. I think it's just as like second or third language
[5898.16 → 5902.32] I would probably learn to speak English from Millennials. Why 2k fashion is coming back
[5902.32 → 5907.76] But it is just like it blew my mind because I was like, I'll pick you I'll pick you up in front of the building, and they were like sweet
[5908.80 → 5911.92] I like sweet. Aren't you like 10 12 years younger than me?
[5913.12 → 5914.80] I sorry have you seen that?
[5914.80 → 5918.56] Why 2k fashion? Yeah, so there's this like fashion again
[5921.20 → 5923.36] Fashion from the year 2000
[5924.08 → 5928.32] Oh, when you say why 2k I assume you mean like the y2k bug. Okay, that makes sense
[5928.64 → 5929.04] um
[5929.04 → 5934.72] But nobody got the year. Nobody refers to the year 2000 as y2k
[5934.72 → 5936.72] That's fair
[5936.72 → 5936.96] That's fair
[5936.96 → 5938.00] That's fair
[5938.00 → 5938.08] Come on
[5938.08 → 5938.56] Um
[5938.56 → 5940.72] 2000s fashion then okay
[5940.72 → 5942.96] There's this like I don't know what it was on because
[5943.44 → 5944.40] Emma showed me
[5944.40 → 5947.04] I know low-rise jeans are back probably Instagram or something
[5947.04 → 5952.88] Uh, but there's this there's this girl talking to her mom about modern fashion trends
[5952.88 → 5957.04] And she mentions y2k fashion and her mom's like wait, what is that?
[5957.04 → 5959.60] And she's like, oh, you wouldn't know it's like too new
[5959.60 → 5966.72] And you can tell like it definitely wasn't a staged video
[5967.36 → 5967.76] um
[5968.96 → 5974.32] Because the daughter's like mildly annoyed at the conversation because she's like oh my goodness like you wouldn't you wouldn't know
[5974.32 → 5978.00] You know, what's hilarious is fashion's always been cyclical to a degree
[5978.00 → 5980.00] I thought it wouldn't be anymore because the internet
[5980.00 → 5983.28] But look but hold on but hold on look at how
[5984.08 → 5990.56] The cycle of everything is speeding up speeding the news cycle is faster the meme cycle is faster is the fashion cycle
[5990.88 → 5993.60] so fast now that instead of
[5994.56 → 5996.80] Coming back around to you know
[5997.60 → 6000.80] What was cool right before or after your mom?
[6001.28 → 6007.20] You're actually coming right back around to like what was cool for your when your mom was cool at the same age
[6008.00 → 6009.44] what?
[6009.52 → 6012.64] Yeah, I mean it seems like it because that that seems weird to me
[6013.04 → 6017.84] There was some stuff that was pretty dumb in the early 2000 remember those jeans that didn't have the seam down the middle
[6018.32 → 6022.40] Yeah, those were horrible. Those were dumb. There was some pretty dumb stuff
[6022.48 → 6026.72] But overall if everyone just kind of dressed like the early 2000s again, I'd be down me too
[6026.80 → 6029.60] I also heard that people are partying to blink-182 music and stuff
[6030.24 → 6032.08] Dude all of I'm like super down
[6032.08 → 6039.12] I think I've had this conversation with you already about how like new music is really struggling because of streaming and algorithms and just
[6039.12 → 6041.52] kind of and the the the
[6042.56 → 6048.64] Aging libraries of established artists are being sucked up by like yes, that's the capital raise
[6048.64 → 6052.80] VC capital backed just like holding firms and like
[6053.76 → 6058.80] pretty much the value of old music for the first time ever is greater than the value of new music
[6058.80 → 6065.92] like I put on I put on just popular music on some random streaming platform, and it just plays stuff that I'm like
[6067.20 → 6070.72] Whereas when I listen to stuff that my mom and dad listened to I'm like
[6070.72 → 6076.24] That's very different. Yeah, but as soon as everything just went computerized
[6076.88 → 6078.24] well
[6078.24 → 6085.76] Okay, yeah, we're just playing around with new ideas of what we can do with a computer essentially, and I know that obviously there's going to be niche genres that are
[6087.52 → 6089.28] different or whatever but at the end of the day
[6090.08 → 6094.48] A lot of the lot of the popular music is still going to be like you've seen that bit
[6094.48 → 6099.92] I forget what the guys are called but they every, so every popular song is like three chords or whatever. Yeah, yeah
[6099.92 → 6100.56] It's funny
[6100.56 → 6105.76] But yeah, and that's that's not going to stop being a thing because there's actual physiological reasons for it
[6105.76 → 6112.48] like the resonance and like of those chords like feels good in your body and stuff like it's an it's a whole thing
[6112.96 → 6114.96] So it's not going it's not going away
[6115.36 → 6120.48] But yeah, I was at I was at a dance recital for one of my progeny
[6120.48 → 6127.60] And the main act from like the senior kids was a dance-off between
[6128.16 → 6129.84] M&M's and M&M's
[6129.84 → 6134.32] um, so they they they played a variety of like
[6135.04 → 6141.04] And when I say M&M music, I don't mean anything. He's done semi recently. I mean like
[6141.92 → 6150.08] Hi, my name is really what my name is like like like old like 1999 1998 M&M music
[6150.48 → 6153.60] And then they had the other team of dancers
[6156.40 → 6158.32] Being like I want candy
[6159.12 → 6164.88] So they were M&M's yeah and M&M's yeah, and they did kind of like a dance battle between it was pretty cute
[6166.08 → 6168.00] Anyway, I'm kind of sitting here going
[6171.68 → 6173.36] Why are why is this relevant?
[6174.56 → 6179.12] This doesn't make any sense. It does seem kind of weird, right? Like I don't know
[6180.96 → 6186.16] I had a had a theory very temporarily that people were partying to blink-182 so that the like
[6186.80 → 6187.20] uh
[6188.08 → 6190.16] Millennials next door wouldn't get mad
[6191.52 → 6196.64] But I don't know I mean I'd rock up to blink-182 apparently simple plan like just never got uncool
[6197.60 → 6202.96] Emily said and I were bonding over like loving simple plan on the way back from our trip to see the steam deck
[6202.96 → 6206.96] Because we forget why, but we ended up having to drive
[6207.52 → 6212.08] Um, and we ended up stuck in the car for you know three and a half hours or something like that
[6212.64 → 6218.08] Um, I don't know that they like still are because I was just trying to see if they still really like music we both
[6219.20 → 6222.56] Were like super into simple plan in high school and I'm like dude
[6223.12 → 6226.88] We are not close enough in age to be into the same stuff in high school
[6226.88 → 6231.04] She's also a Gilmore girls fan which also ended way before
[6231.60 → 6235.12] But simple plan didn't end like she was listening to new simple plan in high school
[6235.12 → 6238.80] And so was I so she didn't even know a lot of their old songs and I'm like dude
[6239.36 → 6244.96] Dude, and she's like dude, this is great. They have us. They have a song from eight months ago. That has a million views
[6245.76 → 6250.48] That's not like insane for music these days on YouTube. Nope, but it's not
[6250.48 → 6252.72] It's still a million views. Yep
[6253.84 → 6258.24] For a band that's been going this long. That's like pretty good, and they make their money touring anyway
[6258.72 → 6263.28] Like any small a lot of their videos are touring videos for sure like any small band like I
[6263.76 → 6268.08] I saw them live at the Croatian cultural centre. Yeah, to give you some idea
[6268.56 → 6275.44] Um, it was awesome super intimate venue nowhere to sit. I prefer those by a lot. It was great
[6275.44 → 6280.40] I saw them again. I saw them again at the pacific coliseum and it was fine. Yeah, not as good
[6280.40 → 6282.48] But like Croatian cultural centre dude
[6283.36 → 6288.16] It was awesome. I I I actually just think I might be over going to big concerts
[6289.76 → 6292.56] So I agree but I I am
[6293.76 → 6297.92] Agreeing with you even more them and I went to go see the star dew valley concert
[6298.56 → 6299.60] Wait
[6299.60 → 6302.00] simple plan is opening for Avril
[6302.96 → 6304.96] She was in town
[6304.96 → 6306.00] I was like
[6306.00 → 6308.40] I found out the day before the show, and I was like fun
[6308.40 → 6311.60] Do you want to like to go because she's got a bunch of Avril in her playlist right now?
[6312.16 → 6316.24] And she was like, I don't know. Maybe not and I was like, okay. Yeah, sure
[6316.24 → 6316.72] Forget it
[6316.72 → 6320.24] If I knew simple plan was there too, I think that might have pushed me over the edge
[6321.36 → 6323.36] Sorry, go ahead
[6323.36 → 6328.72] Uh, right. Yeah, em and I went to the star dew valley concert, and it was in a very
[6328.72 → 6334.56] Surprisingly small venue. I guarantee you they could have booked one significantly larger and still sold out
[6335.20 → 6337.68] Because they sold out like fast, but it was great
[6338.48 → 6342.00] It was awesome and a big part of the reason why it was awesome was because it wasn't huge
[6342.40 → 6344.40] I saw the bare naked ladies
[6344.40 → 6345.68] at a
[6345.68 → 6347.68] WWF not
[6347.68 → 6349.68] World wrestling federation
[6349.68 → 6351.68] World wildlife fund at a
[6351.68 → 6357.68] WWF benefit concert in like a small one of the like small Vancouver theatres. Yeah, so it was like 400
[6357.68 → 6359.68] 400 500 people or something like that
[6360.56 → 6365.36] Mind-blowing so good, and then I saw them again at like gym place or whatever that arena is called now
[6365.36 → 6368.08] And it was like, man, I can kind of I can kind of make out like
[6368.72 → 6372.64] The weird guy who ended up being like coked out doing his weird like kick dance or whatever
[6373.12 → 6378.56] Like I don't know. It wasn't that great. And thank you duke of condor. I agree. My connect shirt is sick
[6378.96 → 6381.20] Um, my sister made it for me
[6381.20 → 6383.68] She had kind of a thing where she would
[6383.68 → 6389.28] Um, she would go to thrift stores and buy unloved things that had something wrong with them
[6389.28 → 6395.92] And then she would combine them into something that someone would love, and she actually made me a couple of so you can see it's uh
[6398.56 → 6402.56] Handstitched right kind of poorly because she was just like I don't know whatever
[6402.96 → 6406.56] Um, realistically looks like it looks like it was meant to look that way
[6406.56 → 6407.36] Yeah, realistically
[6407.36 → 6414.24] Like any amount of remaining life in this is more than it had before yeah, so she actually made me a couple of these
[6414.64 → 6416.88] Uh one was this because she was just like yeah
[6416.88 → 6421.12] I don't know you like the Canucks because I was pretty into I was pretty into the Canucks back then and
[6421.36 → 6423.52] It was hard to buy merch with the old logo
[6423.92 → 6428.72] And I liked the old logo more the old logo is sick and skate very close
[6428.72 → 6436.00] She did me another one that was she found a marine land shirt, you know that aquarium water
[6436.00 → 6441.04] Uh exhibition like that park that was in Niagara Falls Ontario or maybe is still there
[6441.52 → 6446.08] So she and I did a cross-country trip with my mom when I got my driver's license
[6446.80 → 6447.68] and um
[6447.68 → 6448.96] So you drove?
[6448.96 → 6450.96] Yeah, that's kind of the day I got my license
[6450.96 → 6452.40] You went across the country?
[6452.40 → 6452.96] Yeah
[6452.96 → 6453.52] Nice
[6453.52 → 6458.40] Um, and my sister went too because she got her license at the same time as me actually even though she was older
[6458.80 → 6461.28] And so the three of us went across the country
[6461.76 → 6462.08] um
[6463.28 → 6464.48] One heck of a way to learn
[6464.48 → 6466.32] Yep, one moment
[6466.32 → 6466.80] No worries
[6469.76 → 6471.20] Do you want me to cover something, or you're good?
[6471.20 → 6472.16] Anyway, no I'm good
[6472.16 → 6473.04] Okay, um
[6473.76 → 6479.60] So one of the places that I wanted to go was marine land and the only reason I wanted to go there
[6479.60 → 6480.80] It was like my one request
[6481.44 → 6485.04] Okay, so my mom wanted to go to Halifax and eat Atlantic lobster
[6485.76 → 6489.12] Okay, yeah, we're going across the country, but we're not going to eat Atlantic lobster good goal
[6489.12 → 6495.04] All right, absolutely, um, and my thing was I wanted to go to marine land and the only reason that I cared
[6495.68 → 6495.84] um
[6496.80 → 6501.04] It was that they had this super catchy jingle on TV when I was a little kid
[6501.04 → 6506.16] It worked the marketing was effective
[6506.16 → 6511.76] Yeah, so they just had this like this uh this catch this catchphrase in the jingle everyone loves marine land
[6511.76 → 6513.68] Oh, my yeah, I remember it. You know the one
[6513.68 → 6514.64] Niagara
[6514.64 → 6516.88] Niagara Falls on Terri
[6516.88 → 6518.08] I couldn't think of it, please
[6518.08 → 6520.88] Marin eland is the place to go
[6520.88 → 6523.68] See and friends you missed a great big kiss
[6524.16 → 6526.16] Everyone loves marine land
[6526.16 → 6526.72] Yeah, so
[6527.68 → 6529.68] So that's the only reason I cared
[6529.68 → 6531.52] That was so well done
[6532.72 → 6533.52] Um
[6533.52 → 6534.32] Oh my goodness
[6534.32 → 6538.64] So yeah, it's an ear it's an ear uh, what it is an earworm for sure
[6538.64 → 6540.80] Yeah, so anyway, um
[6540.80 → 6542.96] We didn't get to marine land because
[6543.68 → 6550.64] My birthday and the start of the school year lined up in such a way that our trip was pretty short
[6550.88 → 6554.48] Yeah, and we made the difficult call to not
[6555.68 → 6561.44] Go down into the into Canada's penis and uh and visit Niagara Falls
[6562.00 → 6562.16] um
[6562.16 → 6563.44] It's kind of true
[6563.44 → 6564.96] Yeah, and
[6564.96 → 6566.08] Get America
[6567.60 → 6568.00] Anyway
[6568.00 → 6574.72] I mean they definitely put more of their culture in us than we do in them
[6576.08 → 6581.12] Yeah, um any who we didn't make it so so many years later
[6581.12 → 6583.92] She came across a random marine land t-shirt
[6584.48 → 6589.68] And so she cut it out for me and made me she also made me a marine land shirt
[6589.68 → 6593.04] And the reason I don't have that one on today is that I um
[6593.04 → 6598.96] Um, I actually wore it so much like it was this obnoxious bright orange t-shirt with like
[6599.60 → 6602.00] Sort of poorly cut out and that was kind of the vibe
[6602.00 → 6604.00] Yeah, like it was kind of her jam, right?
[6604.00 → 6604.08] Yeah
[6604.08 → 6608.32] It was that it didn't look it didn't look like it was supposed to be like that
[6608.32 → 6609.76] But it looks like it was done
[6609.76 → 6610.24] Yeah
[6610.24 → 6610.88] On purpose
[6610.88 → 6611.04] Yeah
[6611.04 → 6611.84] That's not like I
[6612.40 → 6613.68] It feels like a design
[6613.68 → 6618.64] So I just had this random marine land logo on the shirt and um
[6618.64 → 6623.68] And that's the story I forget why I'm even I oh I forget why am I even talking about this story?
[6623.68 → 6626.24] Oh, yeah, someone said they liked my Canuck shirt. Yeah, thank you very much
[6626.24 → 6629.04] So that's the memorial I'm attending today. Yeah
[6630.08 → 6632.08] Yeah
[6632.56 → 6633.68] Um
[6633.68 → 6635.68] AMD publishes bad benchmarks
[6635.76 → 6636.64] Sure
[6636.64 → 6642.40] AMD released benchmarks for their new zen 3 chips the 5800 XT and the 5900 XT
[6642.64 → 6646.48] Apparently binned versions of the 5800 x and the 5950 x
[6646.48 → 6653.44] Which claimed that gaming performance is on par or better than intel's 13th gen i5-13600k f
[6654.56 → 6657.52] And the i7-13700k respectively
[6658.08 → 6664.24] They achieved these misleading results by pairing each CPU with a three-year-old entry-level GPU
[6664.80 → 6671.84] The radon rx6600 which effectively neutralizes the performance difference of each CPU by heavily
[6671.84 → 6676.16] GPU limiting their tests hardware unbox called out the bogus benchmarks and
[6676.16 → 6683.20] And published results of their own tests using both this rx6600 and the rx7900 XT
[6683.28 → 6687.84] Which showed significant differences in the performance of the various CPUs when performance
[6689.68 → 6692.00] When GPU limitations were less of a factor
[6694.32 → 6701.20] And the discussion question is AMD's marketing lying about the performance of their CPUs or simply setting up a scenario that points
[6701.20 → 6704.56] Uh paints their hardware in the best possible light does it matter?
[6705.04 → 6708.24] I mean it matters. Um, it matters, but it also
[6708.24 → 6712.32] Is why we have independent media and why we need to take
[6713.12 → 6716.24] The funny thing to me about this one is that AMD doesn't
[6717.12 → 6717.28] like
[6718.00 → 6719.60] Have to do this. Yeah
[6720.32 → 6722.96] They're doing really well in the CPU game right now and I
[6722.96 → 6724.56] I it's its so
[6725.76 → 6731.44] It's like an unnecessary risk back to my Qualcomm meeting. It's um, you know when someone's coming in from a position of strength
[6732.32 → 6737.44] Like they are, you know with their battery life claims and all of that. Hey, you can go to sleep. It's very rare
[6737.92 → 6742.56] It's very rare that they are the ones that are fudging
[6742.56 → 6750.08] You know, like NVIDIA was in such a dominant position for so long that they started actually creating tools like their cat which
[6750.80 → 6753.76] Completely changed the game for power monitoring for GPUs
[6754.40 → 6758.80] Uh, their fact which completely changed the game for monitoring uh frame times
[6758.80 → 6763.36] Yeah, um, they came out with these tools and equipped independent media
[6763.84 → 6766.64] To better validate that their solution was way better
[6767.28 → 6772.48] And that was in their best interest. So normally when you're in a position of strength
[6773.28 → 6775.28] You're the one who is like
[6775.60 → 6779.28] working hard to make sure that independent media coverage
[6779.84 → 6785.60] Correctly identifies how much butt you're kicking. Yeah, right. It's very unusual
[6786.32 → 6789.20] for the leader to come in and just
[6791.28 → 6795.92] Fool around like this and this is one of those that I kind of look at, and I go
[6797.68 → 6801.36] There's no way that the technical people liked this
[6801.36 → 6805.20] Like I've met plenty of people at AMD over the years
[6805.20 → 6808.72] There's no way the technical anyone liked this
[6809.36 → 6814.64] I don't even think that this is particularly aligned with AMD's overall behaviour as a company
[6814.64 → 6818.00] So I have a hard time believing that top brass thought this was okay
[6818.40 → 6822.64] This seems like one of those slipped through this seems like one of those middle layer things
[6823.04 → 6827.04] Where someone in a with decision-making power of some sort
[6827.60 → 6830.88] Was like some bonus structure they're trying to hit something maybe they're trying
[6830.96 → 6834.00] They're really trying to sell a bunch of these chips for some reason
[6834.00 → 6842.32] And pushed this through and AMD needs to go back internally and figure out what happened here and make sure it doesn't happen again
[6842.96 → 6845.68] Yeah, no, this is over the line for me for sure
[6845.68 → 6854.80] This is past this is beyond presenting your product in the best light and this is into misleading territory
[6855.84 → 6859.92] This does look like I just found the actual chart. Uh, do you want to go to my screen?
[6859.92 → 6860.56] I don't know why it doesn't
[6863.20 → 6864.48] It's pretty suspicious
[6867.20 → 6869.20] What
[6869.20 → 6873.04] All results are up to yeah
[6873.68 → 6874.00] Yeah
[6874.00 → 6874.32] Yeah
[6875.52 → 6876.72] It's pretty suspicious
[6876.72 → 6881.20] They have other charts as well. Uh, I don't remember exactly where they are. There we go
[6882.64 → 6885.52] Which also feel what pretty suspicious
[6887.04 → 6888.08] What is that chart?
[6890.96 → 6894.72] All results are up to again, by the way. Yeah, sure. All right. 100% of what?
[6894.72 → 6897.68] Uh, the 13 600 whatever
[6897.68 → 6899.20] Yeah, yeah
[6900.88 → 6901.20] All right
[6902.00 → 6903.04] What else we got? Oh
[6903.68 → 6905.68] DJI drones? Oh, is it?
[6906.24 → 6910.16] Oh, it's its it's when after dark, but it's not late. So what are we calling it?
[6910.16 → 6916.24] When afternoon, but it's not afternoon yet. We can do topics for six minutes. Let's do that. All right. Okay
[6916.80 → 6921.36] The US House of Representatives approves a bill that could ban the sale into use of DJI drones. Wow
[6921.36 → 6925.20] I didn't know that second part not just the sale. You can't even use them. Oh
[6925.20 → 6927.20] Oh
[6927.20 → 6929.20] Oh
[6929.20 → 6931.20] What a name
[6931.20 → 6938.08] And that will place DJI on the FCC's covered list banning them from sale to any entity receiving federal funding
[6938.08 → 6938.72] Oh, okay
[6938.72 → 6939.28] Ah
[6939.28 → 6945.84] The features that sparked concerns of spying from us regulators were first implemented by DJI because of us regulators
[6945.84 → 6947.84] And government pressure
[6947.84 → 6953.20] It's uncertain whether the FCC would also ban DJI drones from using regulated wireless frequencies
[6953.20 → 6959.92] Should they do so DJI would effectively be blocked from operating in the US and existing drones could be grounded
[6961.92 → 6962.72] Wow
[6962.72 → 6963.20] Uh
[6963.20 → 6967.36] Discussion question here is at what point are American regulators shooting themselves in the foot?
[6967.36 → 6972.40] There is no us-made alternative for consumers and DJI is like 80 of the drone market
[6973.92 → 6974.24] Yeah
[6975.04 → 6977.20] Neat they might be trying to make one
[6977.52 → 6982.64] um, if you've been paying attention to the war in Ukraine
[6982.96 → 6987.92] um, there's a really crazy documentary out called um
[6989.28 → 6992.56] is it darwin Ukraine
[6992.56 → 6999.44] Yeah, if you just YouTube Darwin in Ukraine, you'll find a scrips' news video
[6999.44 → 7002.32] Which is a really crazy like mini doc on
[7002.96 → 7004.88] The drone warfare that's going on over there
[7005.28 → 7006.80] Um, and there's
[7007.36 → 7012.40] Really kind of wild things happening as well to the up armouring that's happening to
[7013.12 → 7016.16] Tanks and other various armoured vehicles to defend themselves from yeah
[7016.16 → 7022.24] With like netting hanging off of them and stuff like that and just like extra plates that are offset from the tank
[7022.24 → 7024.48] It's like there's all this crazy stuff going on
[7025.60 → 7026.56] so
[7026.56 → 7028.88] owning drone manufacturing and
[7029.60 → 7034.40] Um having that supply chain in your own country might actually be something that us wants
[7034.40 → 7038.96] And this might be one of the ways that they try to strong-arm it is like open up a big market segment
[7039.20 → 7042.16] So that some us company can come up and start making stuff right?
[7042.32 → 7044.32] I don't know. That's some pretty uh
[7046.24 → 7050.80] I'm stretching the theory there a little bit, but I wouldn't be too surprised just looking at the things going on
[7050.80 → 7052.80] It's not the craziest thing I've heard. Yeah
[7054.32 → 7056.80] Uh more random stuff what you want to do gaming roundup?
[7057.52 → 7063.12] Where's that? Yeah, David threw this in Nintendo direct Legend of Zelda echoes of wisdom is the first
[7063.68 → 7066.96] Legend of Zelda game where Zelda is the protagonist
[7067.52 → 7074.24] Except it's the third time. She was the main character in two different CDI games that Nintendo was hoping we uh had forgotten about
[7074.24 → 7083.28] It looks similar in style to 2019's lynx awakening remake but differentiates itself with a nifty echo mechanic that allows you to make copies of certain objects
[7083.52 → 7088.32] That's cool. Pretty cool. Metro id prime 4 still exists. We got to see the first gameplay snippets
[7088.32 → 7093.04] It's coming to switch one but hard to believe that what we saw in the trailer is actually running on that hardware
[7093.12 → 7096.80] So good luck everybody and there's a new Mario party called jamboree
[7096.80 → 7101.20] Hopefully it doesn't suck seven boards with two returning classics over 110 mini-games
[7101.76 → 7105.28] 20 player online multiplayer in the cooperation mode
[7105.68 → 7108.88] But will they still make you sit through a tutorial every time you play?
[7109.52 → 7115.92] Only time will tell probably lots of RPGs like Mario and Luigi brother ship fantasia dragon quest 3 HD
[7116.56 → 7122.32] 2d remake and HD remasters of Donkey Kong country returns and Luigi's mansion 2
[7122.32 → 7129.68] In other gaming news get ready to be mad Todd Howard says he wants to make annual DLC for Starfield will Luke play
[7130.56 → 7131.36] no
[7131.36 → 7131.92] got him
[7133.84 → 7140.16] The next line says maybe they should focus on making players happy first to stop the recent review bombing due to monetizing mods
[7141.20 → 7142.16] Yeah, yeah
[7142.88 → 7148.24] Yeah, if you want to cyberpunk your game you need to make it good not just keep working on it
[7148.24 → 7154.40] uh beyond good and evil's getting a HD remaster for its 20th anniversary and the original has been pulled from storefronts
[7154.88 → 7161.92] And the sequel still never got released. Oh, it's pretty funny. Uh, okay. Okay. Okay. The last news topic that we have here is
[7162.56 → 7163.92] banana
[7164.00 → 7172.00] Last week we brought up banana a steam game that has now touched first place on the steam charts for current active players
[7172.72 → 7178.72] In this game players click a banana to try to earn banana skins that can be sold on the steam marketplace
[7179.36 → 7184.24] Some had speculated early on that this game was a scam or some form of market manipulation
[7184.80 → 7191.76] Even more so once they found out that one of the devs these lions had been involved with a steam market bitcoin cam
[7192.48 → 7193.92] bug before
[7193.92 → 7201.76] bananas co-owner aesthetic spartan released a statement on their discord server saying we did not know about this until recent videos started to point this out
[7202.08 → 7206.88] And we had a talk almost immediately with the whole team about the situation. What do you mean whole team?
[7206.88 → 7208.88] The whole team
[7208.88 → 7214.32] We gave him the chance to explain the situation to us, and we know he is showing remorse and is sorry about what happened in the past
[7215.20 → 7221.60] Since then the banana team has parted ways with these lions adding that his inventory was cleared out of bananas
[7222.08 → 7224.40] To help calm any concerns with the community
[7225.60 → 7227.12] Discussion question
[7227.12 → 7232.08] Banana has said they assure you this isn't a scam, and they do have big plans for content
[7232.56 → 7234.16] For this game in the future
[7234.80 → 7239.92] What do you think their plans could be you literally click a banana? Well, I think it's more skins
[7241.76 → 7244.08] I think it's more skins maybe peels
[7245.52 → 7248.96] But oh man, there was a pun there maybe appealing ones damn it
[7248.96 → 7258.24] Clearly off my game today. That was a good pun though. You just got it a little late. Yeah, you really slipped on that one. Oh
[7259.60 → 7261.60] That's a bruiser
[7261.60 → 7263.60] Oh
[7263.60 → 7265.60] No, make it stop
[7267.20 → 7269.20] I hate it here
[7269.20 → 7274.08] Oh, yeah, okay. I'm like scared. There's more coming. Um
[7275.04 → 7276.80] What like a bunch more puns? Oh
[7285.76 → 7290.88] I think really if they wanted to do anything other than just add more skins, which is probably all they're actually going to do
[7291.52 → 7295.20] The only real route forward is just cookie flickering it even more
[7295.20 → 7300.88] How do you cookie click or something more just partially automate the game?
[7301.44 → 7302.08] Oh god
[7303.20 → 7307.36] Make it so that you can buy like banana farms make it so that make it go faster
[7307.36 → 7312.00] So the game only automates if you're willing to let your GPU mine crypto in the background
[7312.56 → 7313.76] Yeah, yeah
[7314.48 → 7317.04] For them. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they'll give you skins. Yeah, yeah
[7317.60 → 7324.80] Banana coin. Yeah, here we go. They should make it so that uh, the upgrades that increase the automation rate
[7325.20 → 7329.92] Instead of liking cookie clicker where you just like buy them with cookies in this game
[7330.56 → 7331.68] They should be tradable
[7332.32 → 7336.00] So you can buy them with dollars. What do you call like a counterfeit skin?
[7338.64 → 7340.64] A banana phony
[7343.92 → 7344.80] Oh, man
[7346.00 → 7348.00] I can't take it anymore
[7351.52 → 7354.88] Oh, uh, all right. I think it's time for afternoon
[7355.20 → 7359.44] Which is what we're calling after dark today. So I guess hold on. I think I've got an idea
[7364.40 → 7366.72] I think Luke is going bananas. Oh, no
[7371.60 → 7374.00] Oh, it's brighter. Oh, wow
[7376.08 → 7379.04] Oh, wow. Hey look nice, Dan
[7379.04 → 7381.04] Thank you
[7382.16 → 7387.76] Oh, you added the flying stuff. When did you do that? That was Conrad. We have flying toasters for this week
[7388.00 → 7392.08] And uh, I believe we also have the new after darks afternoon sponsors
[7392.08 → 7396.64] Okay, I legitimately don't think we should use those because that there could be a copyright concern
[7397.36 → 7400.80] Explicitly said don't Conrad. You have to ask me before you do that
[7401.52 → 7402.24] um
[7403.20 → 7408.64] Anyway, I think it was actually Dan's idea to turn up the lights for after oh, no, I think that was Luke. That was me
[7408.64 → 7409.44] Oh, was it you?
[7409.44 → 7411.84] I played it off because it seemed more fun at the moment that you made it up
[7411.84 → 7416.56] Yeah, that's that's why I that's why I did that. Oh, it just seemed it seemed like you know it
[7417.12 → 7420.08] Whatever the point is Dan one hit us with a merch message for
[7420.72 → 7423.04] Oh, that is really bright and uh
[7423.12 → 7426.80] The heater has come on, or the cooler has come on as well
[7426.80 → 7430.72] I'm gonna just take the lights like trying really hard something like this. Oh
[7431.84 → 7433.68] I think that's part. No, no, I forbid it
[7434.80 → 7440.32] I wanted it full brightness. Yeah, done. Yeah, it's just part of it's part of the vibe. It's midday. It's hot out
[7440.32 → 7443.68] We need a fan. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Oh, I forgot about the OLED safe
[7445.20 → 7450.80] We can hear the fan. Yeah, because it's its afternoon. Yeah, it's the sun. That's what the sun sounds like
[7450.80 → 7457.20] 100% What's up LDL this one specifically for Luke knowing that you've played a lot of Markov and other first-person shooters
[7457.20 → 7462.08] Have you tried body cam and if so, what are your thoughts on the game? It looks crazy. Have you seen it?
[7462.08 → 7466.96] I saw the early previews and I saw that it's out now. We've talked about it on when it looks wild
[7466.96 → 7468.96] I haven't had a chance to try it. Okay, I
[7469.60 → 7472.96] Try it this week maybe because I'm excited to hear your thoughts on it
[7472.96 → 7474.96] I will try it before next way
[7474.96 → 7479.84] And I will, I'll give you guys that because we've talked about this on way in a couple just like he's going to finish Final Fantasy six
[7479.84 → 7481.84] Yeah, yeah, just like that
[7482.56 → 7486.32] I will this is the first weekend. I will have been home for in a month interesting
[7487.36 → 7493.52] So because I mean yeah, you have to be home to you know play up what's practically a mobile game at this point sure kind of
[7493.52 → 7496.48] Yeah, sure kind of maybe if you weren't such a cheap
[7497.04 → 7499.52] And you would have a don't know a steam deck or something
[7500.88 → 7502.88] That has made it more complicated
[7503.52 → 7507.04] Up next yo yo to dot DLL question for Luke again
[7507.04 → 7510.48] Uh, what technology have you used in your weight loss or fitness journey?
[7510.48 → 7515.12] I want something for tracking my heart rate that isn't a watch to use my kettlebells
[7515.60 → 7517.28] This is going to make you disappointed
[7518.32 → 7527.04] Quite genuinely for a long time the extent of the technology that I used was a phone so that I could have AirPods in listening to either podcast or music
[7527.36 → 7530.40] And quite literally a pen and paper
[7530.40 → 7534.56] Um, you really don't need much tracking your heart rate
[7534.56 → 7537.84] One of the fairly easy ways to sort of do it
[7537.84 → 7541.84] Um is if you have to breathe with your mouth open
[7542.40 → 7543.92] You're probably in zone two
[7544.96 → 7545.84] So you're doing good
[7547.36 → 7550.64] If is you can get by just breathing through your nose
[7550.64 → 7552.64] That's like
[7552.64 → 7555.76] Not a super high heart rate generally
[7555.76 → 7561.68] Um, so try to push it like a little bit more if you're trying to get like cardio out of that situation
[7562.32 → 7565.92] Um, and if is it gets to the point where you have to breathe through your mouth
[7565.92 → 7568.88] Then you're you're pushing yourself a bit. You're probably in zone two
[7569.36 → 7574.08] There are exceptions, but for most people if what you're trying to do is get in better shape
[7574.08 → 7582.08] Then whatever time you spent earning money to buy whatever gadget you spent time shopping for you should have just been you just worked out
[7582.56 → 7582.80] Yep
[7583.76 → 7585.68] And there are ways that are super
[7586.96 → 7589.60] Simple like if you're very not in shape
[7590.32 → 7591.76] Go for a walk
[7591.76 → 7596.96] Not even a like high speed walk just get outside and move, and it'll be
[7597.60 → 7600.56] A million miles better than what you were doing before
[7601.04 → 7603.36] Um, there 's's another one where like
[7603.36 → 7610.24] If speed is an issue like if there are issues with I don't know something and going fast is a problem
[7610.24 → 7612.88] So the walking is good, and you're trying to up it
[7612.88 → 7617.36] But jogging is like an issue for some reason you can crank the
[7618.08 → 7625.12] The angle of the treadmill in the gym and then stay at a walking speed but have an increased angle, and it's way harder
[7625.44 → 7627.20] And it'll, it'll crank your heart rate up
[7627.84 → 7630.16] It'll use muscles in your legs quite heavily
[7630.16 → 7637.44] You can just walk at like three kilometres an hour on a treadmill but have the angle be really high, and it'll be difficult for you
[7637.76 → 7638.00] um
[7638.88 → 7640.00] But yeah, honestly
[7640.96 → 7644.32] I didn't use much I didn't use a heart rate monitor. I didn't use
[7644.72 → 7645.60] uh
[7645.60 → 7650.40] Any anything really way too fancy. I just got out and did stuff and saw results and was happy
[7651.36 → 7656.96] Linus you once mentioned cats being like lightning in a bottle. Can you please elaborate also howdy Luke
[7656.96 → 7658.96] Well, think about it this way
[7660.96 → 7663.12] Lightning very dangerous
[7664.08 → 7665.12] Lightning in a bottle
[7665.92 → 7671.84] Not very dangerous like you know those little like plasma globes that they have at you know little like science exhibits
[7671.84 → 7676.16] So I think you could like just buy them on at like dollar stores now and stuff like that? Yeah, um
[7676.80 → 7682.08] So what I like is very, very dangerous stuff
[7682.08 → 7685.92] But like cute sized and so to me
[7687.28 → 7691.36] Cats are basically that they are such a honed
[7692.64 → 7693.76] killing
[7693.76 → 7695.28] machine like
[7696.24 → 7704.56] The I love them. I think they're beautiful everything about them is designed to as efficiently as possible
[7705.20 → 7706.24] um
[7706.24 → 7708.24] remove the on trails of
[7708.72 → 7713.28] Anything that they decide to remove the on trails of they are apex predators
[7713.76 → 7716.72] And the only reason that a house cat isn't
[7717.36 → 7722.48] Is its size and so you know, I like things that if I was much smaller
[7722.80 → 7726.80] So if I was this big that bottled lightning would be very dangerous
[7727.36 → 7732.88] And in the same way if I was this tall my cat would not be fun
[7732.88 → 7738.56] My cat would be terrifying. Oh, yeah, but because I'm much larger than it
[7743.28 → 7748.08] That's when I that's why I want a main soon good answer. Yeah, I've always wanted an animal in my house
[7748.08 → 7750.56] That if I sleep in too long, it'll just probably eat me
[7751.92 → 7753.92] The fear makes it fun
[7753.92 → 7758.88] Funny hat says house cats are one of the most efficient predators with an extremely high success rate
[7758.88 → 7764.08] Yeah, but its small things don't let your house cats outdoors unless you don't like having birds in your neighbourhood
[7764.08 → 7770.64] It's actually a problem. Yes decimated the population. Yeah, I've also I've got a message here. That's not a merch message from jams
[7771.28 → 7773.28] Strive, uh, you know him
[7773.28 → 7776.16] Yes, uh, wondering if you guys want to discuss this on the show
[7776.64 → 7784.00] What does the audience think of us playing homage to quarter cruise VFX artist react thumbnails by copying their thumbnail style in our tech?
[7784.00 → 7790.48] Experts react thumbs. Did we do that? Would that be perceived as homage or rip off stealing? I don't know. I think it's fine
[7791.44 → 7793.68] I don't I don't think Nico would care. I think that's
[7794.24 → 7798.16] Sort of how YouTube has sort of always worked. Yeah, I don't know
[7798.56 → 7800.56] I mean you guys let us know but I
[7801.44 → 7805.20] I don't even think that's a question. I think I already I think I thought I already told jams just do it
[7806.32 → 7809.60] Because our click-through is not great on that video, but it's a great video and people love it
[7809.60 → 7814.72] So I just need more people to click on it. Yeah, yeah, as long as our colour is different. I don't think it really matters
[7815.60 → 7816.16] Hi, DLL
[7816.16 → 7820.08] It's not like they invented the concept of like people react to anything anyway
[7820.48 → 7823.68] In fact famously fine bros tried to trademark
[7824.24 → 7830.96] React videos at some point or like the React branding for videos, and it failed miserably and everyone hated that
[7830.96 → 7834.40] So like no, it's its very much just a genre at this point
[7834.40 → 7838.80] Yeah, don't do the yellow outline. Yeah, don't do a yellow outline because that's there
[7838.80 → 7843.44] That's clearly there's that that feels like brand identity stuff. Don't take that. Yeah
[7845.44 → 7853.12] Hi, DLL would the snapdragon x elite have been better received if it had been marketed as a low power alternative rather than all the
[7853.12 → 7858.16] Hype of an x86 killer is this the gen AMD wins mobile
[7860.32 → 7862.32] Um, I don't think that
[7863.04 → 7867.52] Well, I mean it depends because AMD's success in mobile comes more down to
[7868.24 → 7871.76] How much fab capacity they've booked than the strength of their design?
[7871.76 → 7875.28] they've had a stronger design for a couple of gens now and
[7876.64 → 7880.96] Yeah, just it's you can't, you can't build out an entire
[7881.76 → 7887.20] mobile product portfolio based on AMD's mobile chips because they just don't they don't have enough of them
[7887.20 → 7892.00] At some point, you're just not going to get a shipment. Not everyone can do that all at once. They can't just
[7892.00 → 7895.60] You know quintuple, or I forget what their market share is in mobile, but
[7896.40 → 7903.20] Essentially, they would have to like five or plus x their shipping output in order to just completely displace intel
[7903.20 → 7906.32] Whereas intel has their own fabs, right? So it's its just not that simple
[7907.04 → 7907.28] um
[7908.08 → 7914.40] But in terms of like winning the battery life and performance men like I've been using a flow x 13 for the last little bit
[7914.40 → 7916.48] And it just kills dude. It's awesome
[7917.12 → 7920.32] And that's that's an AMD based uh, that's an AMD based design
[7920.32 → 7925.84] And if I didn't have that 40 70 GPU in it, it would probably be even more efficient. I
[7927.12 → 7928.32] Oh that
[7928.32 → 7930.16] Merge message got uh archived
[7930.16 → 7933.92] I was kind of referring back to it because my brain is still no, no, it's fine. It's all good. Um
[7934.88 → 7938.40] I think that I think that overhyping things is bad
[7938.88 → 7944.56] But I also don't know if it was a tactical error on Qualcomm's part because I think that
[7944.56 → 7949.04] The percentage of people that watch a Dave 2d video
[7949.52 → 7952.32] Compared to the percentage of people that saw the hype machine
[7952.88 → 7956.24] Um, is probably much lower, and I think overall
[7957.04 → 7962.88] The message is actually going to end up being correct for the majority of people who would buy a thin in light laptop
[7963.36 → 7966.16] So that's a that's a major thing to consider is that
[7966.56 → 7970.24] Something can be true to one person and not necessarily true to another
[7970.24 → 7974.64] I could hand you a Chromebook and I could say this does anything that you would need to do with a computer
[7975.28 → 7979.68] Depending on who I'm talking to that's either very true or very false
[7980.40 → 7987.28] Or somewhere in between right and I think to the Qualcomm customer for this thin and light design what they're saying
[7987.68 → 7991.60] About it being an x86 killer is very true. I think that there are
[7992.48 → 7997.60] Ways that they could have tempered expectations particularly on the gaming side. Yeah, um
[7997.60 → 8000.00] The gaming's well
[8000.08 → 8003.68] We'll see you once more benchmarks come out, but yeah, it feels like it's going that direction overall
[8003.68 → 8007.20] I'm still pretty optimistic and on the gaming side. We actually have a stream planned
[8007.52 → 8013.04] I believe we're going to be doing it next week when you guys are going to be telling us what games you want to see nice
[8013.28 → 8018.72] Yeah, so we'll be we'll probably be doing a benchmark. Yeah, like merch messages for people to let us know what game cool
[8018.88 → 8026.32] Um, and we'll just we'll just be trying stuff. It's going to be yeah, it's going to be fun. I really like the whole like live benchmarks of a new thing
[8026.32 → 8029.84] Concept I think we've been talking about that for years. I think it's great
[8030.88 → 8032.16] Mmm
[8032.16 → 8033.44] Land show
[8033.44 → 8039.28] Afternoon is brought to you by a Pia VPN head to Pia vpn.com slash Linus when for a special deal
[8039.28 → 8044.40] We've got a little QR code there. So the number man the number of people that watch on their TVs just keeps
[8044.96 → 8048.24] Going up. So just yeah, just point your phone your TV QR code
[8048.24 → 8053.12] Pretty wild hey, I get it now. Yeah, TV viewers
[8053.12 → 8056.48] Why would I ever do that YouTube is like taking over the TV?
[8057.52 → 8063.28] It makes sense. Yeah, living room strategy is like totally huge for them right now. Yeah
[8063.92 → 8065.92] anyway, wild
[8066.32 → 8069.76] You sign up for Pia you forgot to use the code. No you

[8074.56 → 8076.40] You can, you retroactively add it?
[8077.44 → 8078.72] Unsubscribe from Pia
[8080.32 → 8082.32] Resubscribe with our code
[8083.76 → 8089.04] Pia is not going to like that actually they're probably not going to care. I don't think they even like what I don't think they even watch our spots
[8089.28 → 8093.52] Yeah, okay, go ahead. Yeah. Hi DLL. I work for an automotive
[8093.52 → 8100.80] OEM as a troubleshooting engineer since starting I have noticed how little some people know about areas outside their own
[8101.36 → 8103.68] Are other areas in tech like this?
[8104.08 → 8105.84] Yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
[8106.72 → 8112.08] That's how the world works and the big the where we really run into trouble
[8112.64 → 8114.40] is when people assume
[8115.28 → 8119.04] That other people know anything about their little bubble that they live in
[8119.84 → 8121.84] or care
[8121.84 → 8124.64] Yeah, that one's rough. Yeah. Yeah
[8125.44 → 8128.64] Because the truth is I suspect you have a decent amount of problems with that actually
[8129.28 → 8134.80] Yeah, probably in the automotive industry. There's probably a decent as a troubleshooting engineer don't care the number of people
[8135.36 → 8137.36] that want to hear about
[8138.00 → 8142.64] Oh, man, the number of people that want to hear about you know, this like switch failure that
[8143.04 → 8149.76] You know, you spent three months chasing down or whatever like I care. I think that's super cool. Me too. Thank you for doing that work
[8149.76 → 8152.16] Yeah, I appreciate you, but a lot of people are going to be like
[8158.48 → 8159.28] All right next up
[8161.36 → 8168.24] Okay, let's see LLD when trading a phone in I always format then max out storage with Linux ISOs
[8168.24 → 8171.44] And then reformat been called paranoid
[8171.44 → 8175.28] But with the recent apple issues, this is an effective way to protect personal data
[8175.28 → 8180.56] Well, I don't know if that would help with the recent apple issue because I thought that was things getting restored from my cloud anyway, so
[8181.20 → 8181.68] um
[8181.84 → 8183.76] No, for flash storage
[8183.76 → 8191.36] To my knowledge if you do a secure erase which formatting a phone should do there is absolutely no reason to fill it up with Linux ISOs
[8192.72 → 8199.36] Sounds fun though. Hello funny names here Linus. Have you noticed any changes in viewership in recent weeks?
[8199.44 → 8203.60] I feel like my YouTube homepage is no clue what I actually want to see lately. Yes
[8203.60 → 8205.92] Um, YouTube's going to be up for a visit
[8205.92 → 8209.76] Uh, very shortly, and I plan to have some conversations with them
[8210.64 → 8213.92] About some of the trends that I've noticed recently where
[8215.68 → 8216.56] um
[8216.56 → 8220.00] It feels like they have an extremely
[8220.72 → 8224.48] extremely fast burn on new content where they'll
[8225.36 → 8229.36] Put it up. They'll promo it and if it doesn't go absolutely mega bang or viral
[8230.08 → 8232.08] Within a day. They're just like you know what forget it
[8232.08 → 8237.92] And I'm having so in general that absolutely seems correct. I'm not saying I disagree
[8238.56 → 8240.88] But they seem to have weird cases as well
[8240.88 → 8245.60] We're like I've had one particular video that was suggested to me on the day that it launched
[8246.08 → 8252.40] And it is now four weeks old, and it has suggested it to me every single time I've loaded YouTube since
[8253.92 → 8260.32] Like what I'm clearly not clicking on it, I'm choosing not to click on this every time that's tough
[8260.32 → 8265.84] Why are you still serving so I'm also noticing so what I'm noticing is the curve instead of looking
[8266.40 → 8267.92] parabolic
[8267.92 → 8270.16] Right and approaching an asymptote
[8271.44 → 8273.44] It goes up
[8273.44 → 8274.64] flattens
[8274.64 → 8276.64] And then in some cases
[8277.12 → 8282.48] Very slowly like doesn't quite asymptote. So some videos are still doing okay
[8283.12 → 8285.84] um, but a lot of them are just
[8285.84 → 8292.16] Um, so YouTube has this metric in the dashboard where they tell you out of your last 10 uploads
[8292.56 → 8298.64] What the one that you just uploaded is ranked, and it updates it constantly because it has to be relative
[8299.12 → 8304.72] To the know hour after release right if it's only been up for an hour obviously it would be the worst out of the last 10
[8305.28 → 8309.84] Because they were uploaded you know anywhere from a week to three weeks ago, and they've got lots more views right?
[8309.84 → 8311.84] So it's so it's relative to
[8312.40 → 8314.40] the original upload time
[8314.40 → 8318.80] And for the over the last couple of weeks since computer we have had
[8319.52 → 8321.92] many like not one or two or
[8323.76 → 8325.84] Probably more than five I think yeah
[8325.84 → 8334.40] So like many we've had many videos many examples of videos that have started out above the fold, you know like as a top five and then
[8334.40 → 8343.76] Flattened out and gone like bottom two bottom three yeah over and over and over and over again and um
[8344.48 → 8348.00] I don't know if it's related but do you remember that video? I showed you of that
[8348.64 → 8350.32] crazy underhand pitcher
[8350.96 → 8356.16] That I shared with you like a long time ago. I think so where he's got this like yeah
[8356.80 → 8361.68] Wild deliver, and then he'll throw it behind his back and the batter never even knows he like released the ball like yeah
[8361.68 → 8364.96] Okay, I was trying to find that video to show chewy
[8365.84 → 8370.80] And I kept searching you probably heard me like raging about this after softball yesterday
[8371.36 → 8376.72] Because I couldn't, I couldn't find it. I kept searching like underhand history
[8377.52 → 8379.44] Weirdest picture like I kept I
[8380.08 → 8381.36] 19 20s
[8381.36 → 8383.52] 1930s like I was I
[8384.08 → 8387.28] kept searching for every search term I could possibly think of
[8388.00 → 8391.60] To find this guy, and it kept just giving me like modern MLB highlights
[8392.64 → 8397.36] Or not even like that modern like a video from eight years ago, but
[8398.16 → 8403.60] 100% MLB no matter how many times I searched underhand
[8404.24 → 8408.32] Softball it didn't matter. It just kept talking about what's it called?
[8408.48 → 8414.00] So there's overhand there's sidearm and then there 's's there's like a there's like a like an overhand pitch motion
[8414.00 → 8418.48] But like under or something that is called something it kept bringing up stuff about that. I'm like
[8420.16 → 8426.72] I am looking for not that and no matter what I searched for it was bringing up like the same half dozen videos
[8426.72 → 8434.48] I was in a meeting with Tarzan. Yeah, trying to find one of my like ancient like seven or eight-year-old videos for as an example of something
[8434.48 → 8437.60] Really quick. Yeah, and we kept on talking about other things in the meeting
[8437.60 → 8440.56] I spent probably 20 25 minutes trying to find it
[8440.72 → 8446.64] I ended up getting the search terms right, and it just wouldn't show it to me when I finally found it
[8446.88 → 8451.28] I had the title I was searching for the title of the video, and it wouldn't bring it up
[8451.44 → 8457.84] But it would bring up it was all Linus tech tip stuff. Yeah, but it was just all within like the last however many months
[8458.72 → 8462.64] It would not find like almost exact word for word title that I was searching
[8462.64 → 8468.96] so I've told them this before but in the early days of them responding to ticktock they um
[8469.92 → 8475.68] I think I felt they leaned too hard into immediacy the importance of immediacy
[8476.16 → 8479.68] And I think it doesn't feel like YouTube. I think they've gone down that path again
[8480.24 → 8484.32] Where it's like no YouTube is a repository YouTube is not about
[8484.96 → 8488.64] Only what's been uploaded in the last little while that's not the point of it anyway
[8488.64 → 8492.88] uh, for those of you who are wondering it's about a half hour video um
[8494.40 → 8498.88] I think this is the one that I watched let me just see if I can find it
[8499.76 → 8500.32] um
[8502.48 → 8506.56] This might not yeah, this might not be the one that I actually watched about him. Let me
[8508.08 → 8510.64] Let me see if I can find it. Let me see if I can find it
[8510.64 → 8512.40] Um
[8515.28 → 8518.24] Anyway, whoops look up Eddie fainer
[8520.48 → 8521.12] Absolutely
[8521.92 → 8527.20] Incredible I forget whose video on him is like really awesome. Uh, it might be
[8528.48 → 8530.88] It might be this one from tony something
[8532.00 → 8534.40] Uh, no, someone did a whole history on him
[8534.40 → 8540.96] But he is the wildest pitcher that you've ever heard of if you don't care about baseball or softball at all
[8541.52 → 8545.68] Doesn't matter. Um, go look it up. You know what? Maybe I'll find the exact
[8546.16 → 8550.48] Maybe I'll find the exact video the one video that's doing pretty well on him is from a couple of years ago
[8550.48 → 8553.60] It's called why you've never heard of the best athlete ever
[8554.56 → 8556.56] um
[8556.64 → 8562.32] I don't know if this is the one that I watched that was so good though. I actually no, I don't think it is
[8562.32 → 8564.80] Anyway, oh
[8565.36 → 8570.64] Someone's calling. Uh, yeah, please text me cool. See you later
[8572.48 → 8573.52] All right, what else we got?
[8574.40 → 8579.60] Linus, what is your preferred flavour of halo CE 2v2 4v4 or 8b8?
[8579.60 → 8584.16] Do you have any strong opinions on spawn killing things? So fun fact, um, I
[8585.28 → 8589.52] Didn't have a lot of money and I didn't actually buy halo CE
[8589.52 → 8591.20] I played the demo
[8592.00 → 8598.40] Which had one map blood bulk the best one. So it's okay. Yeah, and had one mode capture the flag the best one
[8598.40 → 8603.36] So it's okay. So I just played blood bulk 8v8 capture the flag, um until my
[8604.40 → 8609.04] My wrist was raw from rubbing against my mouse pad luckily that is the way to go
[8612.08 → 8612.40] Yeah
[8613.12 → 8616.00] Hey on the subject of borrowing sorry one sec is that coming through?
[8616.00 → 8619.68] I have no idea maybe I can hear it, but yeah
[8619.68 → 8623.04] Um, we have a little bit of a different feed. I'm going to go scream at them
[8623.04 → 8626.32] Uh, I just want to make sure that people don't like to say stuff that
[8626.88 → 8631.44] Shouldn't be on when you know, okay, cool because it's there like lunchtime. That's true
[8631.44 → 8634.88] Uh, hey on the subject of borrowing things from the office
[8634.88 → 8637.84] What has been the most painful item that has gone missing from inventory?
[8638.56 → 8641.12] Oh, the most painful by far was the um
[8641.12 → 8645.28] Um, eight gpus server
[8647.04 → 8650.88] Um that went missing from inventory. Yeah, we accidentally threw it away
[8653.84 → 8659.92] The eight GPUs are an eight c uh eight gamers one CPU the like super micro multi GPU server
[8660.48 → 8662.32] How do we throw something like that away?
[8663.20 → 8666.00] dude if I knew um
[8666.00 → 8673.12] I thought you're going to say the pippin. Oh, yeah, that too. I thought it was called the pigeon and then someone in chat said pippin
[8673.12 → 8677.28] Yeah, our at mark pippin went missing. I don't know what happened to that because that's sad
[8680.96 → 8682.80] Especially because it was in like perfect condition
[8683.60 → 8689.12] Man, I I I still can't find the right Eddie fainer video. There's one that's like it's tough
[8689.12 → 8693.12] There's one that's like a VHS of him like training on stuff. It feels like
[8693.92 → 8697.44] we lost like an encyclopedia of humanity
[8698.08 → 8703.84] To a certain degree because like there's there are old videos that are important that you like can't find anymore
[8703.84 → 8705.84] Which isn't how it's supposed to work?
[8706.40 → 8708.40] It's bad
[8709.92 → 8714.08] I've also personally found that I'm actually like less motivated to watch
[8715.04 → 8718.72] YouTube things these days, which seems bad for them. So maybe they want to address that
[8720.00 → 8722.00] Because it will forcibly
[8722.72 → 8726.48] You know only give me the new things or randomly decide some video
[8726.48 → 8729.44] They're just going to recommend to me for a month straight without me clicking on it
[8730.00 → 8730.96] um
[8730.96 → 8737.28] Is resulting in a lot less like rabbit holing like my favourite thing to do on YouTube where I like to find some weird section of YouTube
[8737.28 → 8739.84] I haven't seen in a long time. That's not happening as much
[8740.40 → 8745.20] Because it's not suggesting me these like weird off-the-wall things that hasn't happened for a long time
[8745.20 → 8747.44] I used to love YouTube, and now it's just
[8747.44 → 8752.80] Even, even one video that I've specifically searched out. It's now recommending me things that
[8753.52 → 8760.32] It thinks I want to watch instead of allowing me to do that. Yeah, like you have to click on a sub tab that is
[8761.76 → 8765.44] Uh about this topic, and it's not always correct. Yeah
[8765.44 → 8767.68] Yeah, yeah, don't like
[8768.40 → 8774.48] More icky. Yes, uh, this one's for Luke. Are you done ff6 yet? I've been playing it with my daughter
[8774.48 → 8776.56] We are going to finish it before you at this rate
[8777.52 → 8780.48] Linus, thanks for the sweet merch uh products heck. Yeah
[8780.48 → 8783.36] I'm home this weekend. I'm going to try to play it. Sure
[8783.36 → 8784.40] I have to play the
[8784.40 → 8788.48] You have to play the other thing, and then you also have to do that other thing as well. So yeah, never
[8788.88 → 8795.76] Uh, how would YouTube function with Linus's CEO? This is great. Uh, would people be mad at YouTube being public with Linus being transparent about?
[8795.92 → 8802.16] Projects as opposed to the secret approach YouTube takes with experiments. I just wouldn't be able to um
[8802.16 → 8808.48] I like legally they would have a lot of obligations
[8808.48 → 8812.56] um around secrecy that I just wouldn't really be able to uh
[8813.92 → 8818.64] Yeah, that I just I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to be transparent about
[8820.80 → 8831.20] Hi DLL my city just adopted AI in its non-emergency 911 line to ease work of the 911 operators as they are
[8831.20 → 8837.04] Understaffed if it hears certain phrases or words it will transfer you to a human
[8837.84 → 8839.84] thoughts
[8839.84 → 8840.64] Uh
[8841.44 → 8843.44] Really doesn't seem that great
[8845.52 → 8851.84] Hey Linus, how did you find sea of stars? I loved it. My kids were really into it
[8851.84 → 8857.84] Which was great now that fantasia has been allowed out of iOS jail. Are you going to pick it up again?
[8857.84 → 8864.16] Um, no, I'm not we talked about that earlier. Um, what was the earlier part of that question?
[8865.36 → 8868.32] Uh, sea of stars. Yeah, I thought sea of stars was good. It was shallow
[8868.32 → 8868.96] um
[8869.76 → 8874.00] And I don't want any spoilers, but I didn't like one of the directions they went with
[8874.96 → 8876.00] story something
[8876.00 → 8876.96] Yeah, yeah
[8876.96 → 8887.84] Hey DLL my pet bed comes in time since moving in with my girlfriend. We don't have to know that much her dog fits it perfectly
[8890.96 → 8892.88] Oh good. Thanks for that Luke
[8894.72 → 8903.68] Yucky uh question for Linus did you ever work on side projects that required money investment, but wife didn't agree or trusted sure
[8903.68 → 8907.60] You're looking at one right now? No, no, she she she
[8910.24 → 8915.36] Oh, man, um, no, we we believe in getting aligned on things, right? So
[8916.24 → 8920.72] If we don't agree then we have to keep talking about it until we agree
[8921.36 → 8927.44] So either I'm working on the side project, and she agrees or I'm not working on the side project, and she agrees
[8927.44 → 8930.40] Yeah
[8932.16 → 8937.92] What do you guys think of the treatment of AI as product versus a feature of a larger product?
[8937.92 → 8940.48] it seems to me that AI forward projects are
[8941.20 → 8945.60] uh, AI forward products are finally dying off, and we can get back to real tech
[8947.52 → 8953.92] Man finally dying off is a strong statement to make while basically every startup is just trying to like to be an AI startup
[8953.92 → 8959.04] And oh, we'll figure out what to do with it later. Yeah, um, no, I think we're very much in the thick of that
[8959.04 → 8962.48] By the way, I think the video I'm looking for may just not be available anymore
[8962.88 → 8966.32] Because I found someone that has a playlist of a bunch of like Eddie fainer videos
[8966.96 → 8968.00] and um
[8968.00 → 8970.64] Maybe it used like copyrighted footage or something
[8970.64 → 8975.36] But it was way better than all of these because it had like a ton of him just pitching
[8976.00 → 8981.76] Just like wild pitches. It was not wild pitches like what it means in baseball where you like to throw it way away from the base
[8981.76 → 8984.88] But like just these wicked crazy pitches
[8985.68 → 8988.96] But yeah, I suspect that maybe it's just been removed
[8988.96 → 8994.00] So that's really unfortunate because it was a really awesome video and there's just not enough about this guy. He's super cool
[8994.96 → 8997.12] Sup boys question for Mr
[8997.12 → 9004.16] Lafrontend, I think you previously mentioned you played rugby. Yeah, so, uh, did you enjoy it and what position did you play?
[9004.80 → 9006.80] I did I played eighth man, which
[9006.80 → 9011.28] uh, I've heard I'm I don't really have the build for, but I was
[9012.48 → 9017.20] I definitely did well enough. Um, my school was terrible
[9017.52 → 9020.96] Uh, but it was fun that the people on the team were fun
[9021.60 → 9021.84] um
[9022.64 → 9023.60] we had like
[9024.64 → 9032.16] Our whole manoeuvre was this guy named Jesse would get it as far up the field as he could, and then he would pass to me
[9032.16 → 9038.32] And I would get it up as far the field as I could and if that didn't make it pretty much the whole way
[9038.32 → 9041.04] We pretty much would not score a try. That was like
[9042.16 → 9045.44] Sort of how it worked, but it was entertaining. The team was really cool. Um
[9046.08 → 9051.12] I had a lot of fun and I enjoyed the sport. I just you know, we just weren't great, but it is what it is
[9052.08 → 9058.24] And last one I've got for you here. Hi, dan's boss and Dan's boss's boss majority shareholder
[9058.24 → 9069.04] Uh with that's that's a good one with most companies in the semi late stage capitalism blatantly disregarding consumer rights is legislation the only solution left
[9069.04 → 9071.04] yep
[9072.96 → 9076.00] Yeah, yeah, that's it. That's all I got I mean
[9076.96 → 9082.00] We could ask consumers to band together for our rights and boycott companies
[9082.00 → 9092.56] Oh, yeah, that's hilarious. Uh, all right. Well, hey, thank you guys very much for tuning into the wan show
[9092.96 → 9097.20] We will see you again next time. Um, different bad time
[9097.84 → 9100.72] But the same bad channel. Yeah. Bye
[9100.72 → 9120.16] I'm so annoyed that I can't find this video. I think it's gone and like I'm so annoyed that I can't tell if it's gone because I can't tell if
[9121.20 → 9122.56] um
[9122.56 → 9124.56] If this is just bad, yeah
