[0.00 --> 1.74]  to the WAN show
[1.74 --> 3.12]  WAN show
[3.12 --> 7.64]  WAN show
[7.64 --> 7.84]  WAN show
[7.84 --> 9.22]  yeah
[9.22 --> 10.84]  it's my favorite show
[10.84 --> 13.34]  because it is my show
[13.34 --> 15.96]  this would be, if it was your show
[15.96 --> 18.56]  it would be your favorite, I forget how the song goes
[18.56 --> 19.62]  but whatever, it was Tom Green
[19.62 --> 21.96]  Tom Green show
[21.96 --> 23.82]  it's not the green Tom, I don't remember the tune
[23.82 --> 25.82]  because I never watched the Tom Green show, I didn't really like it
[25.82 --> 25.96]  but
[25.96 --> 27.84]  oh really?
[27.84 --> 30.50]  yeah, I don't
[30.50 --> 32.02]  I can't tell you why
[32.02 --> 35.26]  Tom Green show, I'm not mistaken, that's the duct tape one
[35.26 --> 35.46]  right?
[37.24 --> 38.72]  oh, I don't know
[38.72 --> 41.26]  wait, no, that's the red green show
[41.26 --> 43.18]  I like the red green show
[43.18 --> 45.54]  you don't know who Tom Green is?
[46.16 --> 47.18]  he was like
[47.18 --> 49.88]  he was like the pre-jackass
[49.88 --> 51.34]  jackass, like the shock
[51.34 --> 52.34]  the shock value
[52.34 --> 54.28]  yeah, like he
[54.28 --> 57.06]  televised his testicular cancer
[57.06 --> 58.48]  operation and stuff like that
[58.48 --> 58.90]  great
[58.90 --> 60.62]  yeah, that's him
[60.62 --> 62.64]  well, I mean, conquering cancer is good
[62.64 --> 63.10]  yeah
[63.10 --> 64.60]  I don't want to look at his balls
[64.60 --> 65.04]  nope
[65.04 --> 65.82]  so there's
[65.82 --> 68.58]  good things and bad things about all of this
[68.58 --> 70.30]  not much
[70.30 --> 71.66]  not much bad to say about
[71.66 --> 72.46]  our first
[72.46 --> 74.10]  sort of teaser topic of the day
[74.10 --> 76.14]  so Skylake CPU's information
[76.14 --> 77.06]  has been leaked
[77.06 --> 79.60]  oh, right
[79.60 --> 80.98]  I'm also the next one
[80.98 --> 82.58]  I heard there was a lake in the sky
[82.58 --> 83.52]  oh
[83.52 --> 85.42]  I heard that was the information that was leaked
[85.42 --> 86.58]  is the Skylake leaking?
[87.18 --> 87.84]  could be
[87.84 --> 91.26]  what are we going to do
[91.26 --> 92.90]  without our sky water?
[93.34 --> 94.52]  is that what rain is?
[95.78 --> 97.26]  Skylakes leaking
[97.26 --> 100.12]  clouds are actually just these big puffy bowls
[100.12 --> 101.56]  you are the rain man
[101.56 --> 103.46]  the cloud just moves too quickly
[103.46 --> 105.36]  and then the water shifts over the side
[105.36 --> 106.84]  and it just falls down
[106.84 --> 107.84]  that's what rain is
[107.84 --> 109.08]  anyways
[109.08 --> 111.18]  Google Project Fi
[111.18 --> 113.32]  and I'm not going to really say anything else about that
[113.32 --> 114.40]  we'll talk more about it later
[114.40 --> 116.04]  it's a good thing this show is about technology
[116.04 --> 116.52]  and not
[116.52 --> 117.60]  and not science
[117.60 --> 118.82]  not weather patterns
[118.82 --> 122.28]  that's why when it's sunny out
[122.28 --> 123.62]  it doesn't look like the clouds are moving
[123.62 --> 125.02]  that's why when it's stormy out
[125.02 --> 126.42]  it looks like the clouds are moving really fast
[126.42 --> 127.40]  speaking of stormy
[127.40 --> 129.24]  my whole world is stormy right now
[129.24 --> 131.16]  because Valve has released an update
[131.16 --> 133.20]  that enables paid mods through the workshop
[133.20 --> 134.24]  something that
[134.24 --> 137.38]  yeah, we'll have to talk about later
[137.38 --> 140.88]  okay, also the first USB Type-C phones
[140.88 --> 142.48]  are being announced
[142.48 --> 144.78]  and this is important for a number of reasons
[144.78 --> 147.64]  and we'll hit you with that later too
[147.64 --> 148.72]  first, the intro
[148.72 --> 149.44]  will it work?
[149.70 --> 150.20]  will it work?
[150.58 --> 151.06]  no
[151.06 --> 152.70]  how did that not work?
[152.88 --> 153.56]  I told you
[153.56 --> 154.82]  it's constantly broken
[154.82 --> 156.48]  that is so stupid
[156.48 --> 157.04]  it is
[157.04 --> 158.52]  this is a local file
[158.52 --> 159.46]  square space
[159.46 --> 161.00]  no, just
[161.00 --> 162.44]  hold on
[162.44 --> 163.12]  let me just turn
[163.12 --> 164.96]  the volume's so loud
[164.96 --> 166.72]  I'm sorry headphone users
[166.72 --> 167.72]  I'm sorry
[167.72 --> 169.62]  oh god, click the thing
[169.62 --> 170.32]  there you go
[170.32 --> 170.76]  okay
[170.76 --> 172.50]  how do I make that go away?
[172.84 --> 173.18]  awesome
[173.18 --> 175.10]  I got this
[175.10 --> 177.52]  I wouldn't be able to do that right now
[177.52 --> 179.04]  no, you wouldn't
[179.04 --> 180.04]  your knee is broken
[180.04 --> 180.96]  just like
[180.96 --> 182.50]  just like the difference
[182.50 --> 184.30]  between these two things is broken
[184.30 --> 185.02]  oh jeez
[185.02 --> 185.62]  also
[185.62 --> 186.28]  Linda
[186.28 --> 189.10]  fresh books
[189.10 --> 192.72]  it's so exciting
[192.72 --> 194.32]  I'm so excited
[194.32 --> 196.32]  I would like my books to be fresh
[196.32 --> 198.38]  and I just can't hide it
[198.38 --> 199.38]  oh
[199.38 --> 200.98]  I'm glad it's Friday
[200.98 --> 205.88]  I am so glad it is Friday today
[205.88 --> 206.90]  I'm glad it's Friday too
[206.90 --> 210.14]  it has been a long friggin
[210.14 --> 211.02]  five weeks
[211.02 --> 214.28]  it has been a long five weeks
[214.28 --> 214.70]  like
[214.70 --> 215.44]  guys
[215.44 --> 216.58]  I was on vacation
[216.58 --> 217.18]  but
[217.18 --> 218.14]  you know what?
[218.22 --> 218.74]  okay, I'm sorry
[218.74 --> 220.40]  we'll get into the actual show later
[220.40 --> 222.00]  first I'm going to talk about my vacation
[222.00 --> 223.46]  I was on vacation
[223.46 --> 224.38]  but it was like
[224.38 --> 226.74]  the worst vacation ever
[226.74 --> 227.58]  I mean
[227.58 --> 228.66]  infants
[228.66 --> 230.08]  toddlers
[230.08 --> 231.44]  you name it
[231.44 --> 232.42]  they were there
[232.42 --> 234.18]  and they were my problem
[234.18 --> 235.22]  and they were sick
[235.22 --> 236.38]  I mean imagine this
[236.38 --> 237.32]  okay, think about this
[237.32 --> 238.52]  you ever been on a plane, right?
[238.62 --> 239.34]  and there's like
[239.34 --> 240.36]  a crying baby
[240.36 --> 242.10]  right across the aisle from you
[242.10 --> 243.20]  and you're just like
[243.20 --> 244.88]  holy crap
[244.88 --> 246.46]  won't that
[246.46 --> 247.38]  parent
[247.38 --> 248.56]  shut that
[248.56 --> 249.06]  kid
[249.06 --> 249.62]  up
[249.62 --> 250.88]  I could go over there
[250.88 --> 252.82]  and pound them into the ground
[252.82 --> 254.04]  and take that kid
[254.04 --> 255.46]  and throw it out the plane
[255.46 --> 256.64]  I don't even like babies
[256.64 --> 257.74]  so yes, that
[257.74 --> 259.74]  now imagine for a second
[259.74 --> 261.24]  that you're that person
[261.24 --> 263.94]  with everyone staring at you
[263.94 --> 265.76]  well maybe you should shut the kid up
[265.76 --> 266.50]  staring daggers
[266.50 --> 268.06]  what are you supposed to do?
[268.12 --> 268.40]  I don't know
[268.40 --> 268.94]  I'm not a dad
[268.94 --> 269.44]  it's your job
[269.44 --> 270.32]  you want to hit them?
[270.60 --> 271.74]  you think then they won't cry?
[271.90 --> 273.10]  you think that's how it works?
[273.14 --> 274.62]  I can't tell welders how to weld
[274.62 --> 276.30]  I'm not going to tell a dad how to dad
[276.30 --> 278.82]  do you think there's a friggin manual?
[279.04 --> 279.34]  yes
[279.34 --> 280.60]  well there is
[280.60 --> 281.96]  but it's not very good
[281.96 --> 285.16]  no, the government of BC
[285.16 --> 285.88]  they have like
[285.88 --> 286.26]  seriously?
[286.46 --> 286.76]  yeah, yeah
[286.76 --> 287.24]  there's a manual
[287.24 --> 287.74]  that's awesome
[287.74 --> 288.98]  yeah, there's like an infant one
[288.98 --> 290.08]  and like a toddler one
[290.08 --> 290.30]  is it Finland?
[290.58 --> 292.24]  where they send you like a whole package
[292.24 --> 293.80]  it's like this big box
[293.80 --> 295.34]  and you have a whole bunch of supplies
[295.34 --> 297.06]  and I don't know if there's any books
[297.06 --> 297.72]  on how to do anything
[297.72 --> 299.04]  but there's a whole bunch of supplies and stuff
[299.04 --> 300.02]  and then when you're done
[300.02 --> 301.04]  you empty out the box
[301.04 --> 302.10]  like when you take everything out of it
[302.10 --> 303.10]  the box becomes a crib
[303.10 --> 304.24]  you lost me at packages
[304.24 --> 305.70]  I thought we were talking about something else
[305.70 --> 306.68]  but I mean
[306.68 --> 307.76]  that's a cool story though
[307.76 --> 309.42]  so anyway
[309.42 --> 311.06]  worst vacation ever
[311.06 --> 311.46]  yeah
[311.46 --> 313.40]  and then I come back
[313.40 --> 315.14]  for like two or three days
[315.14 --> 315.66]  or something like that
[315.66 --> 316.28]  two days I think
[316.28 --> 316.84]  and then
[316.84 --> 317.42]  well hold on
[317.42 --> 318.18]  at the end of the vacation
[318.18 --> 318.82]  I go to Japan
[318.82 --> 320.20]  and I have to hang out with this guy
[320.20 --> 321.96]  for like three days
[321.96 --> 323.26]  or something like that
[323.26 --> 323.44]  yeah
[323.44 --> 323.86]  two
[323.86 --> 325.92]  and we did the Japan Whan
[325.92 --> 326.66]  oh my goodness
[326.66 --> 328.06]  that was such a long day
[328.06 --> 329.58]  like we must have worked 18 hours that day
[329.58 --> 331.16]  I was either in airports
[331.16 --> 332.32]  or in the air
[332.32 --> 333.70]  longer than I was in Japan
[333.70 --> 335.14]  for that trip
[335.14 --> 336.02]  awesome
[336.02 --> 338.92]  so after Japan I came back
[338.92 --> 340.32]  I was home for two or three days
[340.32 --> 341.62]  then I went down to Florida
[341.62 --> 343.56]  to film a thing for Intel and HP
[343.56 --> 346.00]  and I was down there for like three days
[346.00 --> 348.20]  so basically like I arrived late at night
[348.20 --> 349.68]  because that's not a short flight
[349.68 --> 352.28]  Vancouver to Florida is about as far as it gets
[352.28 --> 353.48]  within North America
[353.48 --> 354.12]  not quite
[354.12 --> 356.12]  but like pretty darn close
[356.12 --> 358.46]  so I like waste an entire day flying
[358.46 --> 359.60]  plus the time change
[359.60 --> 360.36]  so that's you know
[360.36 --> 361.28]  11 hours
[361.28 --> 362.44]  in the air
[362.44 --> 362.86]  no
[362.86 --> 365.16]  and if you count being at the airport on time
[365.16 --> 365.80]  so it's like
[365.80 --> 367.96]  13 or 14 hours
[367.96 --> 369.86]  including like transit times and stuff
[369.86 --> 371.84]  then I basically crash
[371.84 --> 374.06]  film all day the next day
[374.06 --> 375.56]  go home and work
[375.56 --> 377.00]  go back to the hotel work
[377.00 --> 377.62]  crash
[377.62 --> 379.64]  then I burn the entire next day
[379.64 --> 381.38]  going back up to Canada
[381.38 --> 383.14]  thankfully I got my three hours back
[383.14 --> 384.70]  but it was like an early morning flight
[384.70 --> 385.32]  so I get back
[385.32 --> 386.02]  I go to NCIX
[386.02 --> 386.64]  I film
[386.64 --> 387.72]  I come back here
[387.72 --> 388.98]  I film WAN show
[388.98 --> 390.44]  after filming a couple things
[390.44 --> 391.24]  then I'm like
[391.24 --> 393.98]  I go home
[393.98 --> 395.74]  I sleep Friday night
[395.74 --> 397.64]  I get Saturday with my family
[397.64 --> 400.14]  and then 1pm Sunday
[400.14 --> 402.00]  I ship off to Munich
[402.00 --> 403.56]  so I go to Germany
[403.56 --> 405.38]  with Nick Van Burkle
[405.38 --> 406.28]  and then I'm there
[406.28 --> 407.44]  until Thursday
[407.44 --> 409.00]  this Wednesday night
[409.00 --> 409.68]  this week
[409.68 --> 411.58]  finally yesterday
[411.58 --> 413.02]  I was back in the office
[413.02 --> 414.24]  back in action
[414.24 --> 416.48]  today I was back in the office
[416.48 --> 420.18]  it is good to be back
[420.18 --> 421.78]  and we are going to get going
[421.78 --> 422.88]  on some of those projects
[422.88 --> 423.12]  that have
[423.12 --> 424.22]  I mean people have been asking
[424.22 --> 426.32]  why is Luke in so many of the videos
[426.32 --> 426.94]  these days
[426.94 --> 428.94]  because Linus has been
[428.94 --> 430.36]  all over the freaking planet
[430.36 --> 432.46]  it hasn't been in the studio
[432.46 --> 433.10]  quite literally
[433.10 --> 434.86]  when are we getting more scrapyard boards
[434.86 --> 435.68]  well gee I don't know
[435.68 --> 436.62]  maybe we would have to have
[436.62 --> 438.58]  one of our two co-hosts
[438.58 --> 440.64]  in the country
[440.64 --> 441.96]  for that to happen
[441.96 --> 444.22]  for like any reasonable amount of time
[444.22 --> 444.78]  so I'm
[444.78 --> 446.34]  okay you had a plan
[446.34 --> 447.86]  to shoot a scrapyard wars
[447.86 --> 448.60]  that was insane
[448.60 --> 449.50]  that was insane
[449.50 --> 450.46]  but at one point in time
[450.46 --> 450.76]  he's like
[450.76 --> 452.32]  no man we gotta do another one
[452.32 --> 453.58]  I'll be back for two days
[453.58 --> 454.60]  I can land
[454.60 --> 456.16]  we can film the whole thing
[456.16 --> 456.98]  all of it
[456.98 --> 457.96]  in the two day period
[457.96 --> 458.30]  I'm like
[458.30 --> 459.30]  what
[459.30 --> 460.98]  there's no way
[460.98 --> 461.68]  that's gonna work
[461.68 --> 462.68]  but
[462.68 --> 463.74]  I'm back
[463.74 --> 463.76]  I'm back
[463.76 --> 466.00]  and we will have
[466.00 --> 466.88]  we will be filming
[466.88 --> 468.00]  a scrapyard wars
[468.00 --> 468.94]  to coincide
[468.94 --> 469.58]  with the opening
[469.58 --> 470.32]  of the new office
[470.32 --> 472.22]  you guys should let me know
[472.22 --> 473.32]  if you want to see
[473.32 --> 474.42]  a new office update
[474.42 --> 476.28]  presumably they've been working on it
[476.28 --> 477.16]  I haven't seen it
[477.16 --> 478.18]  I would love to go in
[478.18 --> 479.00]  and show you guys
[479.00 --> 480.42]  how the sets are going
[480.42 --> 481.42]  and how the office
[481.42 --> 482.32]  building out is going
[482.32 --> 483.66]  I'm personally
[483.66 --> 485.48]  mostly focused these days
[485.48 --> 487.12]  on building up
[487.12 --> 488.40]  the new IT infrastructure
[488.40 --> 489.64]  to put into the new office
[489.64 --> 491.40]  I'm really excited about that
[491.40 --> 492.48]  Luke and I were looking
[492.48 --> 493.12]  at the numbers
[493.12 --> 493.88]  kind of going
[493.88 --> 495.84]  oh snap son
[495.84 --> 496.58]  we're gonna have
[496.58 --> 498.48]  two $4,500 Zeons
[498.48 --> 499.46]  we're gonna have
[499.46 --> 500.04]  I think it was
[500.04 --> 501.34]  11k worth of
[501.34 --> 502.60]  Kingston SSDs
[502.60 --> 502.76]  yeah
[502.76 --> 504.00]  we're gonna have
[504.00 --> 504.66]  I think it was
[504.66 --> 505.92]  16k worth of
[505.92 --> 507.04]  Seagate hard drives
[507.04 --> 507.96]  and this is
[507.96 --> 508.80]  this is just
[508.80 --> 510.88]  like four things
[510.88 --> 512.38]  out of all the
[512.38 --> 512.80]  servers
[512.80 --> 513.54]  so I think we're gonna have
[513.54 --> 513.96]  something like
[513.96 --> 514.90]  three or four racks
[514.90 --> 515.30]  in there
[515.30 --> 515.78]  we're gonna have
[515.78 --> 516.08]  anyway
[516.08 --> 517.52]  there's the Norco racks
[517.52 --> 519.00]  there's everything else
[519.00 --> 520.80]  there's the 45 drives rack
[520.80 --> 521.96]  there's potentially
[521.96 --> 523.58]  a rack for the
[523.58 --> 524.36]  a dedicated rack
[524.36 --> 525.28]  for the security system
[525.28 --> 525.74]  that you don't even
[525.74 --> 526.40]  know about yet
[526.40 --> 528.62]  well a lot of
[528.62 --> 529.46]  high-end security systems
[529.46 --> 530.36]  need rack mount
[530.36 --> 530.74]  stuff
[530.74 --> 531.66]  so I'm not surprised
[531.66 --> 531.86]  at all
[531.86 --> 532.50]  so that's a whole
[532.50 --> 533.14]  other thing
[533.14 --> 534.02]  so yeah
[534.02 --> 534.80]  so we're gonna be
[534.80 --> 535.48]  looking at like
[535.48 --> 536.72]  some pretty mad
[536.72 --> 538.36]  gear in that room
[538.36 --> 539.12]  so I'm gonna be
[539.12 --> 540.04]  I'm getting all of
[540.04 --> 540.70]  that arranged
[540.70 --> 541.32]  ahead of time
[541.32 --> 542.34]  so that when we move in
[542.34 --> 543.12]  we're gonna have
[543.12 --> 544.14]  some wicked infrastructure
[544.14 --> 545.30]  I don't know
[545.30 --> 546.10]  if some of you guys
[546.10 --> 547.54]  saw the Instagram post
[547.54 --> 548.32]  that I sent out
[548.32 --> 549.22]  before the WAN show
[549.22 --> 549.46]  today
[549.46 --> 550.04]  but what I've been
[550.04 --> 550.78]  working on most
[550.78 --> 551.48]  of the day today
[551.48 --> 552.98]  is consolidating
[552.98 --> 553.66]  all of the data
[553.66 --> 554.80]  off of the stupid
[554.80 --> 555.76]  shelf covered in
[555.76 --> 556.44]  hard drives
[556.44 --> 558.12]  onto the
[558.12 --> 558.82]  Storinator
[558.82 --> 560.14]  so that's the
[560.14 --> 561.40]  the 45 drives
[561.40 --> 563.56]  rack mountable system
[563.56 --> 565.12]  and I've been
[565.12 --> 566.12]  building up
[566.12 --> 567.16]  the new
[567.16 --> 568.00]  day-to-day
[568.00 --> 569.00]  use server
[569.00 --> 569.68]  so that's the one
[569.68 --> 570.90]  with the 24
[570.90 --> 571.86]  by the way
[571.86 --> 572.42]  they are not
[572.42 --> 573.78]  V300 SSDs
[573.78 --> 574.42]  so many people
[574.42 --> 574.72]  are like
[574.72 --> 575.38]  oh why are you
[575.38 --> 576.28]  using Kingston V300
[576.28 --> 576.82]  they're actually
[576.82 --> 578.14]  Kingston KC series
[578.14 --> 578.48]  drive
[578.48 --> 579.10]  so they're the new
[579.10 --> 579.74]  KC
[579.74 --> 581.48]  wow I should really
[581.48 --> 582.04]  know this
[582.04 --> 583.72]  the box they came in
[583.72 --> 584.36]  was here somewhere
[584.36 --> 585.14]  but I've lost it
[585.14 --> 585.82]  don't worry about it
[585.82 --> 586.98]  KC something or other
[586.98 --> 587.26]  anyways
[587.26 --> 588.34]  their new KC series
[588.34 --> 589.14]  business drive
[589.14 --> 590.90]  so that is what
[590.90 --> 591.94]  we're actually using
[591.94 --> 592.62]  so it's gonna have
[592.62 --> 594.58]  24 drives
[594.58 --> 595.94]  in RAID 50
[595.94 --> 596.92]  oh KC 310
[596.92 --> 598.84]  24 drives
[598.84 --> 599.74]  in RAID 50
[599.74 --> 601.30]  so just for LOLs
[601.30 --> 604.26]  I made a 24 drive
[604.26 --> 605.00]  RAID 0
[605.00 --> 606.54]  so each 8 drive
[606.54 --> 607.98]  chunk is RAID 0
[607.98 --> 609.88]  then I RAID 0
[609.88 --> 610.68]  striped
[610.68 --> 611.56]  the entire
[611.56 --> 612.84]  3 arrays
[612.84 --> 614.20]  on each of the
[614.20 --> 615.20]  3 RAID cards
[615.20 --> 615.74]  and that
[615.74 --> 616.58]  I had a lot of
[616.58 --> 616.98]  people saying
[616.98 --> 618.00]  oh Linus has got
[618.00 --> 618.62]  a RAM drive
[618.62 --> 619.10]  set up
[619.10 --> 621.50]  no
[621.50 --> 623.02]  no that's
[623.02 --> 624.94]  24 SSDs
[624.94 --> 626.48]  running in RAID 0
[626.48 --> 628.02]  on some pretty
[628.02 --> 629.18]  high end LSI
[629.18 --> 629.70]  controllers
[629.70 --> 630.02]  those are
[630.02 --> 631.40]  9271s
[631.40 --> 632.78]  pretty nice
[632.78 --> 633.74]  controller cards
[633.74 --> 634.24]  so
[634.24 --> 635.62]  internal
[635.62 --> 636.36]  people in chat
[636.36 --> 636.62]  are like
[636.62 --> 637.86]  WTF is RAID 50
[637.86 --> 638.94]  RAID 50
[638.94 --> 639.52]  ah yes
[639.52 --> 639.84]  ok
[639.84 --> 643.08]  it's RAID 5
[643.08 --> 643.84]  I think that was
[643.84 --> 644.16]  nope
[644.16 --> 644.82]  that's the only
[644.82 --> 645.56]  explanation they need
[645.56 --> 646.76]  I was doing this
[646.76 --> 647.04]  because I was
[647.04 --> 647.62]  expecting you were
[647.62 --> 648.18]  going to talk
[648.18 --> 648.78]  and I was going to
[648.78 --> 649.42]  do the symbolism
[649.42 --> 649.88]  while you were
[649.88 --> 650.14]  talking
[650.14 --> 651.12]  I actually do that
[651.12 --> 651.94]  a surprisingly large
[651.94 --> 653.02]  amount of time
[653.02 --> 654.34]  but it didn't work out
[654.34 --> 654.78]  because there was
[654.78 --> 655.30]  no speech
[655.30 --> 655.98]  so it was just like
[655.98 --> 656.92]  ok I can talk now
[656.92 --> 658.26]  so RAID 50
[658.26 --> 658.84]  is the way we're
[658.84 --> 659.66]  actually going to
[659.66 --> 660.66]  run the SSDs
[660.66 --> 661.36]  and that is with
[661.36 --> 662.84]  three 8 drive
[662.84 --> 663.86]  RAID 5s
[663.86 --> 664.42]  so that's
[664.42 --> 665.82]  7 plus 1
[665.82 --> 666.48]  for parity
[666.48 --> 668.02]  ok so we lose
[668.02 --> 669.22]  3 drives worth
[669.22 --> 669.84]  of capacity
[669.84 --> 671.00]  and then I'm going
[671.00 --> 671.52]  to take those
[671.52 --> 672.54]  3 RAID 5s
[672.54 --> 672.98]  and use the
[672.98 --> 673.72]  operating system
[673.72 --> 674.44]  to software
[674.44 --> 675.20]  stripe them
[675.20 --> 675.88]  so we're going
[675.88 --> 676.40]  to get a total
[676.40 --> 676.90]  of I think it's
[676.90 --> 678.56]  around 19 terabytes
[678.56 --> 679.40]  of usable
[679.40 --> 681.34]  RAID 50 storage
[681.34 --> 681.94]  and I ran some
[681.94 --> 682.76]  benchmarks on that
[682.76 --> 683.02]  too
[683.02 --> 684.36]  performance is looking
[684.36 --> 685.12]  really good
[685.12 --> 686.38]  especially for reads
[686.38 --> 687.54]  which is what we want
[687.54 --> 688.42]  because this is
[688.42 --> 689.14]  something that people
[689.14 --> 690.30]  are going to be using
[690.30 --> 692.30]  to play back media
[692.30 --> 693.78]  in real time
[693.78 --> 694.78]  in 4k
[694.78 --> 695.68]  on their project
[695.68 --> 696.06]  timelines
[696.06 --> 696.76]  on their individual
[696.76 --> 697.46]  workstations
[697.46 --> 698.60]  so that one's going
[698.60 --> 700.92]  to have 20 gigabytes
[700.92 --> 702.70]  excuse me
[702.70 --> 703.00]  sorry
[703.00 --> 704.08]  20 gigabytes
[704.08 --> 705.18]  of SSD storage
[705.18 --> 705.78]  ish
[705.78 --> 707.12]  and then it can
[707.12 --> 708.04]  withstand up to
[708.04 --> 708.98]  three drives being
[708.98 --> 709.78]  lost as long as
[709.78 --> 710.62]  it's one per array
[710.62 --> 711.32]  and there's going to be
[711.32 --> 711.92]  a cold spare
[711.92 --> 712.70]  just in case something
[712.70 --> 713.22]  does fail
[713.22 --> 713.90]  so we can pop
[713.90 --> 714.28]  that in there
[714.28 --> 714.96]  I could have gone
[714.96 --> 716.36]  with a hot spare
[716.36 --> 717.48]  and a RAID 5
[717.48 --> 718.58]  but then I only get
[718.58 --> 719.96]  18 drives worth
[719.96 --> 720.56]  of capacity
[720.56 --> 722.10]  which kind of sucks
[722.10 --> 723.08]  and especially
[723.08 --> 723.64]  because we're going
[723.64 --> 724.42]  to be backing it up
[724.42 --> 725.48]  constantly to another
[725.48 --> 726.56]  server throughout the day
[726.56 --> 727.92]  I figure what the hey
[727.92 --> 729.52]  let's just let it do
[729.52 --> 730.48]  its thing
[730.48 --> 731.26]  you know what I mean
[731.26 --> 733.06]  so that's going to be
[733.06 --> 733.96]  super awesome
[733.96 --> 734.62]  then it's going to have
[734.62 --> 736.14]  20 gigabit per second
[736.14 --> 737.70]  bandwidth to the rest
[737.70 --> 739.14]  of the office
[739.14 --> 740.44]  so people will be able
[740.44 --> 742.50]  to actually draw data
[742.50 --> 744.14]  off of it at 2 gigabytes
[744.14 --> 745.60]  per second
[745.60 --> 746.62]  sustained
[746.62 --> 748.08]  madness
[748.08 --> 749.02]  absolutely
[749.02 --> 749.54]  no
[749.54 --> 750.58]  SPARTA
[750.58 --> 751.28]  no
[751.28 --> 753.30]  new office
[753.30 --> 755.20]  get it
[755.20 --> 758.16]  you have to like
[758.16 --> 759.18]  spit a lot though
[759.18 --> 759.94]  so I was
[759.94 --> 760.90]  I can't do it
[760.90 --> 761.40]  because it's going to
[761.40 --> 761.96]  peak the crap
[761.96 --> 762.38]  out of the mic
[762.38 --> 763.26]  yeah I was kind of
[763.26 --> 764.10]  thinking about it too
[764.10 --> 765.06]  I was like
[765.06 --> 766.52]  should I do it
[766.52 --> 767.22]  if we had like a
[767.22 --> 768.30]  really good attenuation
[768.30 --> 768.80]  set up
[768.80 --> 770.24]  I'd just go for it
[770.24 --> 771.40]  but all the headphone
[771.40 --> 772.26]  users are just going to
[772.26 --> 773.30]  like literally bleed
[773.30 --> 774.00]  yeah I'm going to get
[774.00 --> 775.18]  saliva all over the
[775.18 --> 775.62]  blade
[775.62 --> 776.48]  well you could like
[776.48 --> 777.68]  and then go up
[777.68 --> 778.80]  yeah it would still
[778.80 --> 780.36]  spray on there
[780.36 --> 781.16]  like it could even
[781.16 --> 781.82]  get on you
[781.82 --> 782.24]  and I mean
[782.24 --> 783.12]  there are certain
[783.12 --> 784.04]  there are ways I like
[784.04 --> 784.90]  to apply saliva to you
[784.90 --> 785.60]  collateral damage
[785.60 --> 786.38]  for an epic yell
[786.38 --> 787.34]  oh wow
[787.34 --> 790.80]  so let's go ahead
[790.80 --> 792.72]  and get this show
[792.72 --> 793.54]  underway
[793.58 --> 794.62]  so let's start with
[794.62 --> 795.92]  the squeaklockers article
[795.92 --> 796.76]  someone just said
[796.76 --> 797.80]  20 gigabyte raid
[797.80 --> 798.48]  wow Linus
[798.48 --> 800.46]  nope that's wrong
[800.46 --> 801.06]  anyways
[801.06 --> 802.24]  did I say 20 gigabyte
[802.24 --> 803.20]  oh I did too
[803.20 --> 803.66]  I'm sorry
[803.66 --> 803.92]  oh did you
[803.92 --> 804.60]  yeah I did
[804.60 --> 805.24]  oh that's funny
[805.24 --> 806.72]  20 terabyte raid
[806.72 --> 807.82]  sorry sorry
[807.82 --> 808.92]  no no
[808.92 --> 811.10]  um anyways
[811.10 --> 812.46]  squeaklockers article
[812.46 --> 813.34]  I can actually post it
[813.34 --> 813.90]  in the chat
[813.90 --> 815.50]  the chat
[815.50 --> 820.10]  wow
[820.10 --> 821.58]  Wensho
[821.58 --> 823.84]  it's a good thing
[823.84 --> 824.72]  it's live
[824.72 --> 827.08]  for who
[827.08 --> 828.10]  I don't know
[828.10 --> 830.46]  uh so
[830.46 --> 831.36]  oh man
[831.36 --> 832.30]  as you might expect
[832.30 --> 833.08]  this might be a little
[833.08 --> 833.94]  bit hard to read
[833.94 --> 835.32]  um but if you can
[835.32 --> 836.14]  scroll down
[836.14 --> 837.24]  you can make pretty
[837.24 --> 838.12]  good sense of
[838.12 --> 838.86]  the chart
[838.86 --> 839.86]  or I believe
[839.86 --> 840.58]  on the Linus
[840.58 --> 841.50]  tech tips article
[841.50 --> 842.82]  which I can also post
[842.82 --> 844.02]  I think it has an
[844.02 --> 844.70]  English version
[844.70 --> 846.14]  so basically
[846.14 --> 847.26]  I mean it's mostly
[847.26 --> 848.74]  it's mostly numbers
[848.74 --> 849.64]  and things that we
[849.64 --> 850.24]  can pretty much
[850.24 --> 851.08]  interpret on our own
[851.08 --> 852.02]  so the top end
[852.02 --> 853.00]  Skylake model
[853.00 --> 854.28]  is going to be a
[854.28 --> 854.82]  four core
[854.82 --> 855.90]  eight thread
[855.90 --> 857.04]  four gigahertz
[857.04 --> 858.92]  uh 95 watt
[858.92 --> 859.46]  TDP
[859.46 --> 860.66]  sounds an awful
[860.66 --> 861.70]  lot like
[861.70 --> 862.94]  um
[862.94 --> 863.66]  the last
[863.66 --> 865.24]  so 4790k has an
[865.24 --> 866.48]  88 watt TDP
[866.48 --> 867.76]  has the same
[867.76 --> 868.54]  amount of L3
[868.54 --> 869.06]  cache
[869.06 --> 870.04]  turbos to a
[870.04 --> 870.72]  higher amount
[870.72 --> 871.70]  at 4.4
[871.70 --> 872.60]  has the same
[872.60 --> 873.28]  base
[873.28 --> 874.08]  and the same
[874.08 --> 874.68]  core and thread
[874.68 --> 874.94]  count
[874.94 --> 878.60]  so unless
[878.60 --> 879.38]  there are
[879.38 --> 880.72]  some serious
[880.72 --> 882.40]  IPC improvements
[882.40 --> 883.18]  here we are
[883.18 --> 883.88]  looking at
[883.88 --> 885.36]  another generation
[885.36 --> 886.76]  of status quo
[886.76 --> 887.40]  yep
[887.40 --> 888.16]  um
[888.16 --> 889.26]  sounds very much
[889.26 --> 890.02]  like status quo
[890.02 --> 890.60]  I'm sure there
[890.60 --> 891.74]  will be a 10%
[891.74 --> 892.40]  improvement
[892.40 --> 895.14]  uh the 6600k
[895.14 --> 896.04]  breaks the
[896.04 --> 897.18]  traditional naming
[897.18 --> 898.28]  scheme of the
[898.28 --> 899.36]  core i5
[899.36 --> 900.90]  uh four core
[900.90 --> 901.86]  four thread
[901.86 --> 903.06]  variant of the
[903.06 --> 903.94]  high end one
[903.94 --> 905.28]  which is exceptional
[905.28 --> 906.26]  for no reason
[906.26 --> 907.00]  whatsoever
[907.00 --> 911.00]  I don't know
[911.00 --> 911.72]  we have a pretty
[911.72 --> 913.18]  high clocked T-Skew
[913.18 --> 914.00]  which is actually
[914.00 --> 915.22]  pretty sexy looking
[915.22 --> 916.00]  there is a
[916.00 --> 917.76]  2.8 gigahertz
[917.76 --> 919.36]  3.6 turbo
[919.36 --> 920.78]  35 watt
[920.78 --> 921.40]  processor
[921.40 --> 922.94]  so I can geek
[922.94 --> 923.60]  out over that a
[923.60 --> 923.96]  little bit
[923.96 --> 924.70]  that's kind of cool
[924.70 --> 926.48]  I mean if you're
[926.48 --> 927.14]  into like
[927.14 --> 929.10]  wow that's actually
[929.10 --> 929.70]  I mean that
[929.70 --> 930.82]  that's pretty cool
[930.82 --> 931.52]  that's pretty cool
[931.52 --> 932.68]  there's no like
[932.68 --> 933.76]  super badass
[933.76 --> 935.10]  option
[935.10 --> 935.94]  but there's the
[935.94 --> 936.24]  like
[936.24 --> 938.08]  but the good
[938.08 --> 939.06]  news is that
[939.06 --> 939.42]  really really nice
[939.42 --> 940.10]  Prius option
[940.10 --> 941.34]  Intel has finally
[941.34 --> 943.00]  actually restored
[943.00 --> 943.92]  some validity
[943.92 --> 944.72]  to the high end
[944.72 --> 945.16]  platform
[945.16 --> 946.74]  so 2011 v3
[946.74 --> 948.08]  is
[948.08 --> 949.22]  but you don't
[949.22 --> 949.76]  want people to
[949.76 --> 950.58]  restore validity
[950.58 --> 951.30]  to something by
[951.30 --> 952.08]  like stopping
[952.08 --> 952.78]  making the other
[952.78 --> 953.28]  thing better
[953.28 --> 954.20]  right
[954.20 --> 954.58]  it's not like
[954.58 --> 954.98]  they stopped
[954.98 --> 955.52]  making it better
[955.52 --> 956.00]  but like
[956.00 --> 958.02]  you know what I
[958.02 --> 958.20]  mean
[958.20 --> 959.26]  because there
[959.26 --> 959.86]  might be
[959.86 --> 960.54]  improvements in
[960.54 --> 961.06]  other areas
[961.06 --> 961.34]  that don't
[961.34 --> 961.72]  really show up
[961.72 --> 962.22]  like tried
[962.22 --> 962.64]  very well
[962.64 --> 963.54]  but it's
[963.54 --> 964.10]  probably going
[964.10 --> 964.56]  to be that
[964.56 --> 965.02]  good old
[965.02 --> 965.92]  10% that we've
[965.92 --> 966.56]  gotten used to
[966.56 --> 967.58]  so
[967.58 --> 968.96]  35 watts
[968.96 --> 969.30]  suck it
[969.30 --> 969.74]  um
[969.74 --> 970.52]  the first
[970.52 --> 971.52]  USB type
[971.52 --> 972.38]  C phones
[972.38 --> 973.28]  are being
[973.28 --> 973.72]  announced
[973.72 --> 974.46]  this is
[974.46 --> 975.04]  off of
[975.04 --> 975.96]  stuff.tv
[975.96 --> 981.04]  and you've
[981.04 --> 981.70]  probably never
[981.70 --> 982.12]  heard of it
[982.12 --> 982.46]  you know what
[982.46 --> 983.04]  I'm going to
[983.04 --> 983.34]  confess
[983.34 --> 983.84]  I haven't
[983.84 --> 984.72]  actually looked
[984.72 --> 985.34]  at this yet
[985.34 --> 985.72]  so
[985.72 --> 986.76]  I believe
[986.76 --> 987.20]  they're all
[987.20 --> 988.06]  Chinese phones
[988.06 --> 988.94]  so I don't
[988.94 --> 989.60]  think any of
[989.60 --> 990.02]  them are going
[990.02 --> 990.66]  to be necessarily
[990.66 --> 991.50]  available here
[991.50 --> 991.94]  they're all
[991.94 --> 992.56]  I believe
[992.56 --> 993.56]  Li TV
[993.56 --> 994.52]  or L E TV
[994.52 --> 995.10]  I'm not sure
[995.10 --> 995.38]  how you're
[995.38 --> 995.82]  actually supposed
[995.82 --> 995.84]  to say it
[995.84 --> 996.36]  Le TV
[996.36 --> 997.32]  would be my
[997.32 --> 997.58]  guess
[997.58 --> 998.84]  I could be
[998.84 --> 999.20]  wrong
[999.20 --> 1000.68]  but I like
[1000.68 --> 1001.28]  it that way
[1001.28 --> 1001.94]  Le TV
[1001.94 --> 1002.62]  phone
[1002.62 --> 1004.56]  USB type
[1004.56 --> 1004.70]  C
[1004.70 --> 1004.86]  anyway
[1004.86 --> 1005.16]  I think it's
[1005.16 --> 1005.78]  one or two
[1005.78 --> 1006.56]  phones and a
[1006.56 --> 1006.98]  phablet
[1006.98 --> 1008.06]  um
[1008.06 --> 1008.94]  so you're not
[1008.94 --> 1009.84]  even classifying
[1009.84 --> 1010.46]  them as phones
[1010.46 --> 1010.88]  anymore
[1010.88 --> 1013.96]  no
[1013.96 --> 1014.42]  alright
[1014.42 --> 1015.28]  I'm not
[1015.28 --> 1015.60]  I'm not
[1015.60 --> 1016.20]  against you
[1016.20 --> 1017.00]  I'm just
[1017.00 --> 1017.42]  saying
[1017.42 --> 1018.30]  they're just
[1018.30 --> 1018.92]  so
[1018.92 --> 1019.98]  dumb
[1019.98 --> 1022.76]  not a big
[1022.76 --> 1023.46]  phablet guy
[1023.46 --> 1023.90]  because I'm
[1023.90 --> 1024.30]  not a big
[1024.30 --> 1024.64]  guy
[1024.64 --> 1025.48]  oh
[1025.48 --> 1026.38]  oh
[1026.38 --> 1027.12]  I get why
[1027.12 --> 1027.66]  some people
[1027.66 --> 1028.08]  like them
[1028.08 --> 1028.72]  just to be
[1028.72 --> 1029.00]  clear
[1029.00 --> 1029.58]  I get why
[1029.58 --> 1030.02]  some people
[1030.02 --> 1030.46]  like them
[1030.46 --> 1031.26]  but you know
[1031.26 --> 1031.94]  it was really
[1031.94 --> 1032.76]  refreshing for
[1032.76 --> 1033.40]  me to see
[1033.40 --> 1034.32]  the Galaxy
[1034.32 --> 1035.30]  S6
[1035.30 --> 1035.92]  just
[1035.92 --> 1037.32]  be a normal
[1037.32 --> 1037.78]  size
[1037.78 --> 1039.10]  and not have
[1039.10 --> 1039.56]  to up the
[1039.56 --> 1039.86]  ante
[1039.86 --> 1040.96]  in terms of
[1040.96 --> 1041.52]  just making
[1041.52 --> 1042.00]  it bigger
[1042.00 --> 1043.12]  I do have to
[1043.12 --> 1043.46]  say though
[1043.46 --> 1043.92]  this phone
[1043.92 --> 1044.46]  is too small
[1044.46 --> 1045.22]  the iPhone
[1045.22 --> 1045.72]  5S
[1045.72 --> 1046.12]  yeah
[1046.12 --> 1046.92]  height is
[1046.92 --> 1047.56]  probably okay
[1047.56 --> 1048.12]  but like
[1048.12 --> 1048.82]  when my thumb
[1048.82 --> 1049.48]  takes up
[1049.48 --> 1050.26]  that much
[1050.26 --> 1050.82]  of the screen
[1050.82 --> 1051.78]  I can't type
[1051.78 --> 1052.98]  I don't have
[1052.98 --> 1053.80]  my 6 on me
[1053.80 --> 1054.16]  but I bet
[1054.16 --> 1054.64]  the 6 would
[1054.64 --> 1055.14]  be more like
[1055.14 --> 1055.66]  your size
[1055.66 --> 1056.36]  I typo
[1056.36 --> 1057.20]  almost every
[1057.20 --> 1057.48]  word
[1057.48 --> 1058.64]  like it's
[1058.64 --> 1059.12]  insane
[1059.12 --> 1060.02]  the thing
[1060.02 --> 1060.36]  I don't
[1060.36 --> 1061.04]  the thing
[1061.04 --> 1061.46]  I don't like
[1061.46 --> 1062.02]  about the 6
[1062.02 --> 1062.48]  though is the
[1062.48 --> 1063.12]  rounded edges
[1063.12 --> 1063.58]  it just
[1063.58 --> 1064.46]  it doesn't
[1064.46 --> 1065.10]  work for me
[1065.10 --> 1065.54]  I like this
[1065.54 --> 1066.52]  one's form
[1066.52 --> 1066.84]  factor
[1066.84 --> 1067.58]  very much
[1067.58 --> 1068.38]  except I
[1068.38 --> 1068.76]  just wish
[1068.76 --> 1069.24]  like just
[1069.24 --> 1069.88]  make it a bit
[1069.88 --> 1070.16]  wider
[1070.16 --> 1070.74]  and then
[1070.74 --> 1071.14]  everything else
[1071.14 --> 1071.90]  would be great
[1071.90 --> 1074.28]  so I actually
[1074.28 --> 1074.92]  finished my
[1074.92 --> 1075.70]  Galaxy S6
[1075.70 --> 1076.08]  review
[1076.08 --> 1077.14]  okay hold on
[1077.14 --> 1077.62]  we should probably
[1077.62 --> 1079.22]  talk about USB 3
[1079.22 --> 1079.80]  Type-C
[1079.80 --> 1080.90]  so just to be
[1080.90 --> 1081.38]  clear guys
[1081.38 --> 1082.36]  USB 3
[1082.36 --> 1083.78]  USB Type-C
[1083.78 --> 1085.28]  doesn't necessarily
[1085.28 --> 1085.98]  have to be
[1085.98 --> 1087.14]  USB 3.1
[1087.14 --> 1087.74]  this is actually
[1087.74 --> 1088.74]  something I didn't
[1088.74 --> 1089.32]  realize
[1089.32 --> 1090.20]  I think I even
[1090.20 --> 1090.62]  did
[1090.62 --> 1091.48]  as fast as
[1091.48 --> 1091.88]  possible
[1091.88 --> 1092.62]  where I might
[1092.62 --> 1093.18]  have actually
[1093.18 --> 1093.66]  covered
[1093.66 --> 1095.20]  that it doesn't
[1095.20 --> 1095.66]  have to be
[1095.66 --> 1096.28]  10 gigabit
[1096.28 --> 1096.64]  but didn't
[1096.64 --> 1097.26]  like absorb
[1097.26 --> 1097.98]  yeah
[1097.98 --> 1099.06]  I think I
[1099.06 --> 1099.64]  covered it a
[1099.64 --> 1100.02]  little bit
[1100.02 --> 1100.38]  in my
[1100.38 --> 1101.22]  MSI coverage
[1101.22 --> 1102.14]  at CES
[1102.14 --> 1102.62]  I thought
[1102.62 --> 1103.10]  they all
[1103.10 --> 1103.50]  had to be
[1103.50 --> 1104.10]  10 gigabit
[1104.10 --> 1104.70]  turns out
[1104.70 --> 1105.46]  they don't
[1105.46 --> 1106.16]  so the
[1106.16 --> 1107.84]  first USB 3
[1107.84 --> 1108.46]  Type-C
[1108.46 --> 1109.14]  device that
[1109.14 --> 1109.66]  we'll be
[1109.66 --> 1110.00]  getting
[1110.00 --> 1110.64]  like finished
[1110.64 --> 1111.10]  device
[1111.10 --> 1112.14]  I don't know
[1112.14 --> 1112.64]  if I'm allowed
[1112.64 --> 1113.28]  to say
[1113.28 --> 1114.02]  anything about
[1114.02 --> 1114.36]  it but
[1114.36 --> 1114.76]  it's gonna
[1114.76 --> 1115.58]  be a USB
[1115.58 --> 1116.74]  3.0
[1116.74 --> 1117.54]  Type-C
[1117.54 --> 1118.46]  so that's
[1118.46 --> 1119.14]  5 gigabit
[1119.14 --> 1119.64]  per second
[1119.64 --> 1120.50]  versus USB
[1120.50 --> 1121.36]  3.1
[1121.36 --> 1121.78]  Type-C
[1121.78 --> 1122.06]  which is
[1122.06 --> 1122.54]  10 gigabit
[1122.54 --> 1122.84]  per second
[1122.84 --> 1123.60]  so I'm not
[1123.60 --> 1124.50]  necessarily expecting
[1124.50 --> 1125.34]  phones to have
[1125.34 --> 1125.98]  10 gigabit
[1125.98 --> 1126.44]  per second
[1126.44 --> 1127.28]  connectivity
[1127.28 --> 1128.22]  because there
[1128.22 --> 1128.42]  would be
[1128.42 --> 1128.90]  literally
[1128.90 --> 1130.12]  no benefit
[1130.12 --> 1130.66]  at all
[1130.66 --> 1131.42]  like even
[1131.42 --> 1132.02]  high-end
[1132.02 --> 1132.58]  phones like
[1132.58 --> 1133.04]  the Galaxy
[1133.04 --> 1133.82]  S6 right
[1133.82 --> 1134.78]  now would
[1134.78 --> 1135.28]  not be
[1135.28 --> 1136.06]  even close
[1136.06 --> 1136.80]  to saturating
[1136.80 --> 1138.28]  USB 3.0
[1138.28 --> 1139.18]  if in
[1139.18 --> 1139.60]  just in
[1139.60 --> 1140.00]  sustained
[1140.00 --> 1140.64]  transfer rate
[1140.64 --> 1141.00]  so it's
[1141.00 --> 1141.74]  not a
[1141.74 --> 1142.30]  concern at
[1142.30 --> 1142.86]  all for
[1142.86 --> 1143.20]  the time
[1143.20 --> 1143.50]  being
[1143.50 --> 1144.56]  but the
[1144.56 --> 1145.12]  benefits
[1145.12 --> 1146.26]  either way
[1146.26 --> 1146.64]  are that
[1146.64 --> 1146.80]  it's
[1146.80 --> 1147.14]  reversible
[1147.14 --> 1147.98]  so you
[1147.98 --> 1148.24]  don't have
[1148.24 --> 1148.62]  to fumble
[1148.62 --> 1148.98]  for it
[1148.98 --> 1149.18]  in the
[1149.18 --> 1149.42]  dark
[1149.42 --> 1149.76]  in
[1149.76 --> 1150.28]  theory
[1150.28 --> 1150.66]  although
[1150.66 --> 1151.06]  this has
[1151.06 --> 1151.58]  not
[1151.58 --> 1151.96]  been
[1151.96 --> 1152.46]  validated
[1152.46 --> 1152.96]  yet
[1152.96 --> 1153.94]  it is
[1153.94 --> 1154.20]  more
[1154.20 --> 1154.84]  durable
[1154.84 --> 1155.50]  than
[1155.50 --> 1156.20]  micro
[1156.20 --> 1157.50]  USB
[1157.50 --> 1158.18]  I
[1158.18 --> 1158.70]  have
[1158.70 --> 1158.98]  some
[1158.98 --> 1159.36]  worries
[1159.36 --> 1159.64]  about
[1159.64 --> 1159.90]  that
[1159.90 --> 1160.48]  I
[1160.48 --> 1160.76]  do
[1160.76 --> 1161.10]  too
[1161.10 --> 1161.50]  but you
[1161.50 --> 1161.72]  know
[1161.72 --> 1162.06]  what
[1162.06 --> 1162.56]  if there
[1162.56 --> 1162.78]  were
[1162.78 --> 1163.26]  two
[1163.26 --> 1164.04]  companies
[1164.04 --> 1164.60]  that I
[1164.60 --> 1164.78]  would
[1164.78 --> 1165.26]  expect
[1165.26 --> 1165.60]  to
[1165.60 --> 1165.96]  kind
[1165.96 --> 1166.30]  of
[1166.30 --> 1167.42]  validate
[1167.42 --> 1168.14]  something
[1168.14 --> 1168.82]  before
[1168.82 --> 1170.14]  tossing it
[1170.14 --> 1170.40]  out to
[1170.40 --> 1170.70]  all their
[1170.70 --> 1171.22]  customers
[1171.22 --> 1171.94]  they would
[1171.94 --> 1172.28]  be
[1172.28 --> 1172.84]  Apple
[1172.84 --> 1174.44]  Apple
[1174.44 --> 1175.00]  implemented
[1175.00 --> 1175.24]  it
[1175.24 --> 1175.32]  yeah
[1175.32 --> 1176.38]  but
[1176.38 --> 1177.16]  Apple
[1177.16 --> 1177.60]  has been
[1177.60 --> 1178.00]  changing
[1178.00 --> 1178.38]  a lot
[1178.38 --> 1178.74]  Apple
[1178.74 --> 1179.38]  has never
[1179.38 --> 1180.04]  adopted
[1180.04 --> 1180.68]  micro
[1180.68 --> 1180.90]  B
[1180.90 --> 1181.18]  though
[1181.18 --> 1182.42]  and
[1182.42 --> 1182.74]  Lightning
[1182.74 --> 1183.18]  is an
[1183.18 --> 1183.68]  excellent
[1183.68 --> 1184.18]  connector
[1184.18 --> 1185.16]  yeah
[1185.16 --> 1185.42]  I think
[1185.42 --> 1185.68]  Lightning
[1185.68 --> 1185.92]  is a
[1185.92 --> 1186.12]  lot
[1186.12 --> 1186.32]  better
[1186.32 --> 1186.50]  than
[1186.50 --> 1186.86]  Type-C
[1186.86 --> 1187.68]  so
[1187.68 --> 1188.08]  I
[1188.08 --> 1188.70]  in terms
[1188.70 --> 1189.02]  of the
[1189.02 --> 1189.32]  just
[1189.32 --> 1189.56]  the
[1189.56 --> 1189.94]  physical
[1189.94 --> 1190.34]  connector
[1190.34 --> 1190.64]  they
[1190.64 --> 1190.98]  adopted
[1190.98 --> 1191.40]  Type-C
[1191.40 --> 1192.12]  not only
[1192.12 --> 1192.42]  did they
[1192.42 --> 1192.74]  adopt
[1192.74 --> 1193.30]  Type-C
[1193.30 --> 1193.50]  I mean
[1193.50 --> 1194.02]  and remember
[1194.02 --> 1194.82]  Apple's
[1194.82 --> 1195.40]  warranty
[1195.40 --> 1196.00]  policies
[1196.00 --> 1196.44]  are
[1196.44 --> 1196.92]  extremely
[1196.92 --> 1197.36]  good
[1197.36 --> 1197.78]  yeah
[1197.78 --> 1198.30]  for them
[1198.30 --> 1198.72]  to go
[1198.72 --> 1199.18]  okay
[1199.18 --> 1199.78]  we're
[1199.78 --> 1200.04]  betting
[1200.04 --> 1200.28]  on
[1200.28 --> 1200.80]  Type-C
[1200.80 --> 1201.26]  being
[1201.26 --> 1201.94]  the
[1201.94 --> 1202.86]  only
[1202.86 --> 1203.44]  connector
[1203.44 --> 1204.40]  to plug
[1204.40 --> 1204.52]  in
[1204.52 --> 1204.94]  anything
[1204.94 --> 1205.40]  else
[1205.40 --> 1206.68]  apparently
[1206.68 --> 1207.50]  they expect
[1207.50 --> 1207.86]  that to
[1207.86 --> 1208.16]  last
[1208.16 --> 1208.62]  for the
[1208.62 --> 1209.04]  lifetime
[1209.04 --> 1209.36]  of that
[1209.36 --> 1209.68]  device
[1209.68 --> 1210.00]  with the
[1210.00 --> 1210.32]  Type-C
[1210.32 --> 1210.58]  that I've
[1210.58 --> 1210.84]  worked with
[1210.84 --> 1211.28]  so far
[1211.28 --> 1211.62]  and this
[1211.62 --> 1212.10]  could be
[1212.10 --> 1212.62]  a
[1212.62 --> 1213.62]  not fully
[1213.62 --> 1214.02]  released
[1214.02 --> 1214.44]  thing
[1214.44 --> 1216.00]  because it
[1216.00 --> 1216.56]  was all
[1216.56 --> 1217.52]  tester stuff
[1217.52 --> 1218.50]  this could be
[1218.50 --> 1219.10]  a wasn't
[1219.10 --> 1219.76]  worn in enough
[1219.76 --> 1220.30]  at all
[1220.30 --> 1220.74]  yet
[1220.74 --> 1221.18]  thing
[1221.18 --> 1221.40]  because it
[1221.40 --> 1221.92]  was fresh
[1221.92 --> 1222.74]  but like
[1222.74 --> 1223.80]  to plug it
[1223.80 --> 1224.20]  in you have
[1224.20 --> 1224.48]  to like
[1224.48 --> 1225.54]  push
[1225.54 --> 1226.70]  pretty hard
[1226.70 --> 1227.10]  and to
[1227.10 --> 1227.78]  take it out
[1227.78 --> 1228.10]  you have to
[1228.10 --> 1228.72]  pull pretty
[1228.72 --> 1229.04]  hard
[1229.04 --> 1229.70]  like when I
[1229.70 --> 1230.08]  first plugged
[1230.08 --> 1230.34]  it in
[1230.34 --> 1230.88]  I thought it
[1230.88 --> 1231.24]  was fully
[1231.24 --> 1231.70]  plugged in
[1231.70 --> 1232.34]  and then
[1232.34 --> 1232.76]  let go
[1232.76 --> 1233.24]  and was like
[1233.24 --> 1233.74]  oh interesting
[1233.74 --> 1234.10]  I didn't
[1234.10 --> 1234.42]  feel it
[1234.42 --> 1234.70]  lock
[1234.70 --> 1235.38]  and then
[1235.38 --> 1235.64]  Burkle
[1235.64 --> 1236.14]  was like
[1236.14 --> 1237.48]  and like
[1237.48 --> 1238.12]  shoved it
[1238.12 --> 1238.64]  in and it
[1238.64 --> 1239.10]  clicked in
[1239.10 --> 1239.28]  and I was
[1239.28 --> 1239.76]  like wow
[1239.76 --> 1240.16]  okay
[1240.16 --> 1240.50]  and then
[1240.50 --> 1240.82]  you have to
[1240.82 --> 1242.62]  reef on it
[1242.62 --> 1243.06]  pretty hard
[1243.06 --> 1243.40]  to get it
[1243.40 --> 1243.50]  out
[1243.50 --> 1243.98]  like it's
[1243.98 --> 1244.72]  weird
[1244.72 --> 1245.40]  and I'm
[1245.40 --> 1246.72]  worried about
[1246.72 --> 1247.28]  the amount
[1247.28 --> 1247.60]  of force
[1247.60 --> 1248.08]  it takes
[1248.08 --> 1248.84]  right
[1248.84 --> 1249.28]  I feel like
[1249.28 --> 1249.62]  it could be
[1249.62 --> 1250.34]  bad for
[1250.34 --> 1251.06]  multiple things
[1251.06 --> 1251.50]  interesting
[1251.50 --> 1252.56]  well I have
[1252.56 --> 1253.18]  a Type-C
[1253.18 --> 1253.80]  motherboard
[1253.80 --> 1254.96]  and prototype
[1254.96 --> 1256.22]  device downstairs
[1256.22 --> 1256.76]  that I'll be
[1256.76 --> 1257.24]  checking out
[1257.24 --> 1257.66]  maybe I'll take
[1257.66 --> 1257.86]  it home
[1257.86 --> 1258.20]  this weekend
[1258.20 --> 1258.66]  this was quite
[1258.66 --> 1259.12]  a while ago
[1259.12 --> 1259.54]  and this was
[1259.54 --> 1259.84]  with like
[1259.84 --> 1260.60]  super tester
[1260.60 --> 1261.36]  level stuff
[1261.36 --> 1261.66]  so
[1261.66 --> 1262.96]  that could
[1262.96 --> 1263.20]  all be
[1263.20 --> 1263.68]  wrong
[1263.68 --> 1264.84]  so anyway
[1264.84 --> 1265.92]  those phones
[1265.92 --> 1267.40]  oh yeah
[1267.40 --> 1267.68]  oh right
[1267.68 --> 1268.08]  there's a bunch
[1268.08 --> 1268.32]  of other
[1268.32 --> 1268.66]  benefits
[1268.66 --> 1269.14]  so you can
[1269.14 --> 1269.56]  connect your
[1269.56 --> 1270.00]  device to
[1270.00 --> 1270.38]  an external
[1270.38 --> 1270.90]  display
[1270.90 --> 1271.52]  through it
[1271.52 --> 1272.28]  I mean
[1272.28 --> 1272.58]  you can do
[1272.58 --> 1273.08]  a lot of
[1273.08 --> 1273.58]  different things
[1273.58 --> 1273.90]  through it
[1273.90 --> 1274.70]  with dongles
[1274.70 --> 1275.16]  and whatnot
[1275.16 --> 1276.22]  thanks to
[1276.22 --> 1276.74]  the USB
[1276.74 --> 1277.44]  at least
[1277.44 --> 1278.14]  3.0
[1278.14 --> 1278.60]  bandwidth
[1278.60 --> 1280.20]  as well
[1280.20 --> 1280.64]  as just
[1280.64 --> 1281.18]  the flexibility
[1281.18 --> 1281.68]  of the
[1281.68 --> 1281.96]  connector
[1281.96 --> 1282.42]  standard
[1282.42 --> 1284.18]  I have
[1284.18 --> 1284.48]  a lot
[1284.48 --> 1284.80]  of hope
[1284.80 --> 1285.12]  for it
[1285.12 --> 1285.56]  being better
[1285.56 --> 1285.74]  than
[1285.74 --> 1286.22]  Micro B
[1286.22 --> 1286.66]  because
[1286.66 --> 1287.54]  almost anything
[1287.54 --> 1287.90]  would be
[1287.90 --> 1288.24]  better than
[1288.24 --> 1288.68]  Micro B
[1288.68 --> 1290.30]  so there's
[1290.30 --> 1290.56]  that
[1290.56 --> 1291.14]  we can talk
[1291.14 --> 1291.48]  a little bit
[1291.48 --> 1291.88]  about those
[1291.88 --> 1292.16]  phones
[1292.16 --> 1292.48]  so there's
[1292.48 --> 1292.90]  a low end
[1292.90 --> 1293.30]  one with
[1293.30 --> 1294.06]  a 5.5
[1294.06 --> 1294.78]  inch 1080p
[1294.78 --> 1295.46]  display
[1295.46 --> 1296.60]  a MediaTek
[1296.60 --> 1298.10]  X10 processor
[1298.10 --> 1299.08]  3 gigs of RAM
[1299.08 --> 1300.14]  3000 milliamp
[1300.14 --> 1300.52]  power battery
[1300.52 --> 1301.08]  it's funny how
[1301.08 --> 1302.30]  like a 3000
[1302.30 --> 1302.78]  milliamp
[1302.78 --> 1303.40]  power battery
[1303.40 --> 1304.30]  3 gigs of RAM
[1304.30 --> 1305.14]  and a 1080p
[1305.14 --> 1305.72]  screen are
[1305.72 --> 1306.36]  low end phone
[1306.36 --> 1306.74]  these days
[1306.74 --> 1307.32]  it's nice
[1307.32 --> 1308.16]  the mid range
[1308.16 --> 1309.34]  one has a
[1309.34 --> 1310.24]  2k display
[1310.24 --> 1311.08]  Snapdragon 810
[1311.08 --> 1311.58]  processor
[1311.58 --> 1312.62]  4 gigs of RAM
[1312.62 --> 1313.72]  and the high end
[1313.72 --> 1314.32]  phablet one
[1314.32 --> 1315.10]  is also a 2k
[1315.10 --> 1315.62]  display but
[1315.62 --> 1316.76]  6.3 inch
[1316.76 --> 1317.60]  so it's huge
[1317.60 --> 1318.84]  4 gigs of RAM
[1318.84 --> 1319.84]  Snapdragon 810
[1319.84 --> 1321.10]  and AKG
[1321.10 --> 1321.72]  audio apparently
[1321.72 --> 1322.18]  they're getting
[1322.18 --> 1322.90]  into the whole
[1322.90 --> 1324.28]  you know
[1324.28 --> 1324.76]  that's really
[1324.76 --> 1325.96]  rebranded
[1325.96 --> 1326.76]  audio
[1326.76 --> 1327.48]  thing
[1327.48 --> 1327.82]  you know
[1327.82 --> 1328.14]  the funny
[1328.14 --> 1328.60]  thing about
[1328.60 --> 1329.08]  that is
[1329.08 --> 1329.62]  the companies
[1329.62 --> 1330.08]  that are
[1330.08 --> 1331.22]  rebranding
[1331.22 --> 1332.10]  the phones
[1332.10 --> 1332.40]  whether
[1332.40 --> 1332.88]  be it
[1332.88 --> 1333.38]  Beats
[1333.38 --> 1334.48]  or AKG
[1334.48 --> 1335.52]  or you know
[1335.52 --> 1336.24]  Harman Kardon
[1336.24 --> 1336.64]  or whatever
[1336.64 --> 1336.98]  else
[1336.98 --> 1337.66]  none of them
[1337.66 --> 1338.60]  make DAX
[1338.60 --> 1343.84]  and for that
[1343.84 --> 1344.02]  matter
[1344.02 --> 1344.68]  does AKG
[1344.68 --> 1345.14]  even make
[1345.14 --> 1345.68]  speakers
[1345.68 --> 1348.02]  not that I
[1348.02 --> 1348.48]  know of
[1348.48 --> 1348.82]  but I could
[1348.82 --> 1349.26]  totally be
[1349.26 --> 1349.70]  wrong about
[1349.70 --> 1349.86]  that
[1349.86 --> 1350.14]  I don't
[1350.14 --> 1350.42]  know
[1350.42 --> 1351.26]  enough
[1351.26 --> 1351.60]  so I guess
[1351.60 --> 1351.98]  it's just
[1351.98 --> 1352.34]  like a
[1352.34 --> 1352.90]  certification
[1352.90 --> 1353.94]  process
[1353.94 --> 1354.70]  or something
[1354.70 --> 1355.64]  maybe the
[1355.64 --> 1356.02]  microphone
[1356.02 --> 1356.60]  is really
[1356.60 --> 1356.94]  good
[1356.94 --> 1358.22]  or something
[1358.22 --> 1358.66]  anyway
[1358.66 --> 1360.00]  let's move
[1360.00 --> 1360.52]  on to
[1360.52 --> 1360.88]  another
[1360.88 --> 1361.30]  phone

[1366.58 --> 1367.04]  lifestyle
[1367.04 --> 1367.48]  and it
[1367.48 --> 1367.92]  shows that

[1368.32 --> 1368.82]  hugging
[1368.82 --> 1369.26]  what I
[1369.26 --> 1369.60]  presume
[1369.60 --> 1369.94]  is his
[1369.94 --> 1370.24]  girlfriend
[1370.24 --> 1370.86]  and it's

[1438.24 --> 1440.14]  to be um
[1440.14 --> 1442.08]  reintroducing
[1442.08 --> 1442.54]  the invite
[1442.54 --> 1443.94]  system with
[1443.94 --> 1444.64]  the launch
[1444.64 --> 1445.06]  of the
[1445.06 --> 1445.86]  one plus
[1445.86 --> 1447.10]  two which
[1447.10 --> 1447.66]  we're expecting
[1447.66 --> 1448.56]  sometime in
[1448.56 --> 1448.90]  the third
[1448.90 --> 1449.58]  quarter so
[1449.58 --> 1450.00]  sometime in
[1450.00 --> 1450.28]  about the
[1450.28 --> 1450.84]  next three
[1450.84 --> 1451.64]  to six
[1451.64 --> 1452.70]  months
[1452.70 --> 1453.80]  so as
[1453.80 --> 1454.48]  annoyed as
[1454.48 --> 1455.00]  you were
[1455.00 --> 1455.80]  with one
[1455.80 --> 1456.58]  plus and
[1456.58 --> 1457.34]  the whole
[1457.34 --> 1458.26]  you know
[1458.26 --> 1459.44]  invite system
[1459.44 --> 1460.24]  or send
[1460.24 --> 1460.58]  us your
[1460.58 --> 1461.36]  sexy photos
[1461.36 --> 1461.90]  and you
[1461.90 --> 1462.24]  can get
[1462.24 --> 1462.76]  a phone
[1462.76 --> 1463.14]  or you
[1463.14 --> 1463.48]  can buy
[1463.48 --> 1463.96]  a phone
[1463.96 --> 1465.30]  or whatever
[1465.30 --> 1466.02]  all of the
[1466.02 --> 1466.46]  completely
[1466.46 --> 1467.24]  all coming
[1467.24 --> 1467.44]  back
[1467.44 --> 1468.00]  disastrous
[1468.00 --> 1468.54]  stuff
[1468.54 --> 1469.44]  I guess
[1469.44 --> 1469.80]  it's all
[1469.80 --> 1470.56]  coming back
[1470.56 --> 1471.28]  um they do
[1471.28 --> 1471.84]  have some
[1471.84 --> 1472.62]  comments about
[1472.62 --> 1473.24]  the one plus
[1473.24 --> 1473.98]  two so
[1473.98 --> 1474.98]  we'll be far
[1474.98 --> 1475.70]  more prepared
[1475.70 --> 1477.02]  to to make
[1477.02 --> 1477.84]  the uh the
[1477.84 --> 1479.02]  transition into
[1479.02 --> 1479.78]  whatever the
[1479.78 --> 1480.66]  original transition
[1480.66 --> 1481.28]  was something
[1481.28 --> 1482.30]  something uh
[1482.30 --> 1482.86]  we're committed
[1482.86 --> 1483.56]  to maintaining
[1483.56 --> 1484.80]  razor thin margins
[1484.80 --> 1485.28]  in order to
[1485.28 --> 1485.76]  give as much
[1485.76 --> 1486.48]  value as
[1486.48 --> 1487.02]  possible back
[1487.02 --> 1487.56]  to users
[1487.56 --> 1488.36]  and this
[1488.36 --> 1488.94]  increases our
[1488.94 --> 1489.54]  risk it will
[1489.54 --> 1489.92]  bring the
[1489.92 --> 1490.64]  challenges that
[1490.64 --> 1491.16]  came along with
[1491.16 --> 1491.50]  a brand new
[1491.50 --> 1491.94]  product and
[1491.94 --> 1492.48]  initially our
[1492.48 --> 1493.06]  invite system
[1493.06 --> 1493.52]  will help us
[1493.52 --> 1494.14]  to manage that
[1494.14 --> 1495.48]  risk it also
[1495.48 --> 1496.48]  helps us to be
[1496.48 --> 1497.14]  sure that every
[1497.14 --> 1497.80]  one plus two
[1497.80 --> 1498.62]  user gets the
[1498.62 --> 1499.92]  amazing experience
[1499.92 --> 1500.80]  that they
[1500.80 --> 1502.00]  deserve
[1502.00 --> 1503.36]  sure man
[1503.36 --> 1504.20]  so
[1504.20 --> 1504.56]  there's some
[1504.56 --> 1505.16]  rumored specs
[1505.16 --> 1505.84]  of the one plus
[1505.84 --> 1506.78]  two there's a
[1506.78 --> 1507.64]  qualcomm snapdragon
[1507.64 --> 1508.66]  810 processor
[1508.66 --> 1510.54]  android 5 dual sim
[1510.54 --> 1511.20]  card support which
[1511.20 --> 1511.96]  is kind of cool for
[1511.96 --> 1512.98]  like some people
[1512.98 --> 1514.42]  i think it's kind of
[1514.42 --> 1514.90]  cool but not
[1514.90 --> 1515.12]  everyone
[1515.12 --> 1516.86]  yeah i would like
[1516.86 --> 1517.82]  it too four gigs
[1517.82 --> 1518.74]  of ram micro sd
[1518.74 --> 1519.44]  card support which
[1519.44 --> 1520.54]  is going away on a
[1520.54 --> 1521.14]  lot of phones so
[1521.14 --> 1522.06]  that's nice yeah i
[1522.06 --> 1522.96]  was really surprised
[1522.96 --> 1524.26]  to see galaxy s6
[1524.26 --> 1525.24]  with no removable
[1525.24 --> 1526.00]  battery and no
[1526.00 --> 1527.52]  micro sd yeah and
[1527.52 --> 1528.62]  a 3300 milliamp
[1528.62 --> 1530.06]  hour battery with
[1530.06 --> 1531.72]  that said the one
[1531.72 --> 1533.40]  time that i've ever
[1533.40 --> 1534.80]  really had to use
[1534.80 --> 1535.80]  micro sd on an
[1535.80 --> 1536.64]  android device it
[1536.64 --> 1537.96]  let me down i
[1537.96 --> 1538.72]  tried to use the
[1538.72 --> 1539.68]  micro sd expansion
[1539.68 --> 1541.34]  on my shield uh
[1541.34 --> 1542.14]  shield portable but
[1542.14 --> 1543.46]  i can't i can't
[1543.46 --> 1543.88]  figure out what
[1543.88 --> 1544.50]  nvidia is calling
[1544.50 --> 1545.14]  any of this stuff
[1545.14 --> 1545.68]  is that one of our
[1545.68 --> 1546.52]  news articles today
[1546.52 --> 1547.84]  no i didn't look at
[1547.84 --> 1548.48]  it in the article but
[1548.48 --> 1550.12]  they renamed the
[1550.12 --> 1551.84]  shield console they
[1551.84 --> 1552.62]  renamed it shield
[1552.62 --> 1554.18]  android tv it's like
[1554.18 --> 1555.04]  what are you are you
[1555.04 --> 1556.28]  android tv are you
[1556.28 --> 1557.66]  shield you don't know
[1557.66 --> 1558.56]  what you are and
[1558.56 --> 1561.94]  oh so and so i think
[1561.94 --> 1562.72]  it's still called the
[1562.72 --> 1563.58]  shield portable the
[1563.58 --> 1565.68]  handheld one okay so i
[1565.68 --> 1567.12]  wanted to store some
[1567.12 --> 1568.58]  emulated games some
[1568.58 --> 1569.82]  roms on it and the
[1569.82 --> 1570.98]  original shield yeah
[1570.98 --> 1572.64]  okay see exactly
[1572.64 --> 1574.76]  shield classic there's
[1574.76 --> 1575.68]  a shield now with
[1575.68 --> 1576.66]  more aspartame the
[1576.66 --> 1577.24]  shield tablets
[1577.24 --> 1578.04]  technically handheld
[1578.04 --> 1579.76]  yeah you're that's
[1579.76 --> 1581.54]  true like i'm not
[1581.54 --> 1582.20]  saying you're wrong
[1582.20 --> 1583.20]  it's just confusing
[1583.20 --> 1584.16]  it's incredibly
[1584.16 --> 1585.68]  confusing so i wanted
[1585.68 --> 1586.52]  to put some roms on
[1586.52 --> 1588.32]  an sd card turns out
[1588.32 --> 1589.66]  that if you load a
[1589.66 --> 1590.86]  rom off an sd card
[1590.86 --> 1592.58]  with the retro whatever
[1592.58 --> 1593.98]  arc retro arc whatever
[1593.98 --> 1595.06]  it's called uh
[1595.06 --> 1595.72]  something something
[1595.72 --> 1597.28]  save states right
[1597.28 --> 1597.94]  yeah not that we
[1597.94 --> 1599.36]  condone uh original
[1599.36 --> 1600.48]  cartridges and all that
[1600.48 --> 1601.96]  noise um so save
[1601.96 --> 1604.18]  states don't save
[1604.18 --> 1605.42]  they try to save and
[1605.42 --> 1606.42]  then there's like a
[1606.42 --> 1607.42]  write permissions
[1607.42 --> 1608.64]  problem something
[1608.64 --> 1609.48]  something i have to
[1609.48 --> 1610.08]  put it on the actual
[1610.08 --> 1610.74]  internal memory so i'm
[1610.74 --> 1611.14]  sitting here going
[1611.14 --> 1612.62]  what do you people
[1612.62 --> 1613.86]  actually use this for
[1613.86 --> 1614.76]  because i've switched
[1614.76 --> 1615.98]  to a streaming music
[1615.98 --> 1618.46]  service and so you
[1618.46 --> 1619.16]  don't use the videos
[1619.16 --> 1621.90]  part photos okay but
[1621.90 --> 1622.28]  you're not going to
[1622.28 --> 1623.02]  take photos with your
[1623.02 --> 1623.82]  shield i'm not going to
[1623.82 --> 1624.92]  take well even on my
[1624.92 --> 1625.70]  phones i'm not going to
[1625.70 --> 1627.14]  take more than like 16
[1627.14 --> 1628.66]  gigs is not enough no so
[1628.66 --> 1629.86]  i don't buy into that
[1629.86 --> 1630.82]  but i'm not going to
[1630.82 --> 1632.50]  take 32 gigs of photos
[1632.50 --> 1634.46]  and i don't need a
[1634.46 --> 1635.38]  bazillion apps like i
[1635.38 --> 1636.84]  think i i like to think
[1636.84 --> 1637.64]  people have mostly
[1637.64 --> 1639.02]  gotten over the i need
[1639.02 --> 1640.34]  200 apps on my phone
[1640.34 --> 1642.48]  thing because there's i
[1642.48 --> 1643.62]  mean i can't come up
[1643.62 --> 1644.30]  with a reason to have
[1644.30 --> 1646.08]  more than about 50 you
[1646.08 --> 1646.90]  know or like and then
[1646.90 --> 1648.08]  like a plus or minus you
[1648.08 --> 1649.16]  know like 10 for like
[1649.16 --> 1650.08]  the couple games you're
[1650.08 --> 1651.36]  playing right now like
[1651.36 --> 1652.60]  the i have the junk
[1652.60 --> 1653.30]  folder and then i have
[1653.30 --> 1654.60]  the super junk folder and
[1654.60 --> 1655.44]  the super junk folder i
[1655.44 --> 1656.38]  don't have probably more
[1656.38 --> 1657.60]  than 50 but the super
[1657.60 --> 1658.68]  junk folder is literally
[1658.68 --> 1660.18]  just like the stuff that
[1660.18 --> 1660.90]  comes with the phone that
[1660.90 --> 1661.66]  i can't get rid of
[1661.66 --> 1663.00]  the mobility apps yeah
[1663.00 --> 1664.36]  yeah or like whatever
[1664.36 --> 1666.18]  junk that i might need to
[1666.18 --> 1667.76]  access once in however
[1667.76 --> 1669.84]  long somehow dbrand managed
[1669.84 --> 1671.10]  to send me a bell phone
[1671.10 --> 1673.44]  and i was just like great
[1673.44 --> 1676.46]  i'm sure glad i didn't just
[1676.46 --> 1677.48]  get a random carrier
[1677.48 --> 1678.34]  unlocked one
[1678.34 --> 1680.88]  it's like how did you find
[1680.88 --> 1682.44]  this they're not even
[1682.44 --> 1682.96]  canadian
[1682.96 --> 1686.14]  that's so random but yeah
[1686.14 --> 1687.40]  i mean i found that even
[1687.40 --> 1689.58]  having some apps installed
[1689.58 --> 1690.72]  on my phone tanks the
[1690.72 --> 1691.70]  battery life like i had
[1691.70 --> 1693.04]  that issue with and maybe
[1693.04 --> 1694.12]  it's resolved by now and
[1694.12 --> 1694.76]  maybe it was just
[1694.76 --> 1695.98]  particular to the one m8
[1695.98 --> 1697.12]  but i had that issue with
[1697.12 --> 1699.74]  plex just junking the
[1699.74 --> 1700.74]  battery life of the one i
[1700.74 --> 1701.60]  made even when i wasn't
[1701.60 --> 1704.76]  using it at all so i like i
[1704.76 --> 1706.00]  don't know i think 32 gigs
[1706.00 --> 1708.24]  is lots i think 64 gigs is
[1708.24 --> 1711.74]  tons um and the 128 gigs that
[1711.74 --> 1712.98]  i have on the iphone 6 is
[1712.98 --> 1714.20]  like way more than enough
[1714.20 --> 1716.80]  so uh i don't know i'm not
[1716.80 --> 1717.70]  i don't care that much
[1717.70 --> 1719.36]  about sd expansion and i
[1719.36 --> 1720.38]  don't really care that much
[1720.38 --> 1721.90]  about removable battery but
[1721.90 --> 1723.80]  i do wish that the galaxy s6
[1723.80 --> 1724.44]  had a larger
[1724.44 --> 1726.20]  had a higher capacity battery
[1726.20 --> 1726.76]  are they
[1726.76 --> 1728.84]  oh a bunch of people were
[1728.84 --> 1729.44]  like what
[1729.44 --> 1730.48]  they are canadian
[1730.48 --> 1731.48]  oh oops

[1797.64 --> 1798.52]  enough that they were the
[1798.52 --> 1799.80]  first that i think they were the
[1799.80 --> 1801.20]  second hit for one plus light
[1801.20 --> 1802.46]  something along those lines
[1802.46 --> 1804.90]  wow their site is slow look at
[1804.90 --> 1807.14]  all them yeah holy actual balls
[1807.14 --> 1808.50]  and they don't have just like a
[1808.50 --> 1810.06]  wow it's just so many things are
[1810.06 --> 1811.52]  loading it's just a link to john
[1811.52 --> 1815.20]  rettinger's video and then like a
[1815.20 --> 1818.26]  mass ton of ads the most ads holy
[1818.26 --> 1819.70]  crap and like a bunch of clickbait
[1819.70 --> 1822.30]  crap okay this site is terrible so
[1822.30 --> 1823.94]  i don't care anymore i've i've
[1823.94 --> 1825.62]  i've lost my attention span for
[1825.62 --> 1828.70]  it so google project five yeah
[1828.70 --> 1829.98]  original article here is from
[1829.98 --> 1831.60]  the verge.com so i'll go ahead
[1831.60 --> 1834.08]  just in case you weren't sure if
[1834.08 --> 1836.22]  google has all of your data yet
[1836.22 --> 1838.86]  yeah now you can be 100 sure
[1838.86 --> 1840.26]  because they can be your cellular
[1840.26 --> 1843.28]  provider tell me this that news last
[1843.28 --> 1844.88]  week about bell selling customer
[1844.88 --> 1847.48]  information who would you rather
[1847.48 --> 1849.52]  google or bell at this point
[1849.52 --> 1853.20]  you might as well keep it all in
[1853.20 --> 1854.72]  one place you might as well just
[1854.72 --> 1856.12]  have all of it since they already
[1856.12 --> 1858.28]  have it all anyway like whatever i
[1858.28 --> 1860.04]  don't know well they yeah they know
[1860.04 --> 1861.26]  okay they do know where you are
[1861.26 --> 1865.18]  all right okay taryn posted on
[1865.18 --> 1867.44]  something the other day that he was
[1867.44 --> 1869.28]  happy that that service that he posted
[1869.28 --> 1872.84]  it on um didn't necessarily know where
[1872.84 --> 1875.34]  he worked and lived and what he did
[1875.34 --> 1877.28]  for work and all this kind of stuff
[1877.28 --> 1879.08]  because it would keep asking him about
[1879.08 --> 1881.42]  it and i read it and didn't comment
[1881.42 --> 1884.64]  on it but i was like dude they know
[1884.64 --> 1886.24]  where you're logging in and where you
[1886.24 --> 1888.02]  stay logged in overnight and then they
[1888.02 --> 1890.52]  know where you log in every day and who
[1890.52 --> 1892.50]  else all logs in there and then who
[1892.50 --> 1894.18]  else has those things filled in their
[1894.18 --> 1897.44]  profiles while you're there like they
[1897.44 --> 1899.78]  know they just want you to fill it out
[1899.78 --> 1901.40]  so that it can tell everyone else really
[1901.40 --> 1903.44]  easily and so that you give them 100%
[1903.44 --> 1905.50]  permission to know that information they
[1905.50 --> 1907.96]  know exactly what's going on yeah like
[1907.96 --> 1910.64]  that's why what is it like uh kmart or
[1910.64 --> 1912.42]  whatever knows when people are pregnant
[1912.42 --> 1914.04]  often before they do because they're
[1914.04 --> 1915.56]  like shopping patterns will change and
[1915.56 --> 1920.04]  stuff like they know yeah it's done
[1920.04 --> 1921.24]  anyways they want to be a cellular
[1921.24 --> 1924.52]  provider um it will be running on both
[1924.52 --> 1927.00]  sprint and t what running both sprint and
[1927.00 --> 1928.82]  t-mobile switching between the two as
[1928.82 --> 1930.64]  well as wi-fi base which is pretty cool
[1930.64 --> 1932.44]  we'll talk about that more later um 20
[1932.44 --> 1934.36]  bucks a month gets you talking texting
[1934.36 --> 1936.32]  and wi-fi tethering and international
[1936.32 --> 1938.84]  coverage in 120 plus countries and a
[1938.84 --> 1940.34]  flat this is a really interesting pay
[1940.34 --> 1941.74]  model for their data hold on can i jump
[1941.74 --> 1944.52]  in for a minute yes how is wi-fi tethering
[1944.52 --> 1948.06]  not included it i mean in other places
[1948.06 --> 1950.42]  yeah how is wi-fi tethering still a
[1950.42 --> 1954.26]  feature it is 2015 yeah man that makes me
[1954.26 --> 1956.00]  mad every time i go down to the states
[1956.00 --> 1957.96]  and because i'm just using a pay as you
[1957.96 --> 1960.32]  go and like i get it you're not going to
[1960.32 --> 1962.38]  give you know you're not going to give
[1962.38 --> 1965.38]  it all away to the you know pay once
[1965.38 --> 1967.46]  per use customers if you know what i'm
[1967.46 --> 1969.08]  something wherever i was going with that
[1969.08 --> 1972.36]  and it's just depart um so i like i get
[1972.36 --> 1973.86]  it you're not going to have every feature
[1973.86 --> 1975.96]  i don't expect to have you know voicemail
[1975.96 --> 1977.76]  transcribing to text messages and sending
[1977.76 --> 1980.32]  it to me like i like i get that but not
[1980.32 --> 1982.28]  being able to use the data that i paid
[1982.28 --> 1985.64]  for is really frustrating like i was trying
[1985.64 --> 1988.64]  to do something playing the show oh uh
[1988.64 --> 1992.70]  no all which people are saying sorry i'm
[1992.70 --> 1993.92]  confused all which people are like hey
[1993.92 --> 1995.32]  line it's the wine show starting i'm like
[1995.32 --> 1999.28]  what the i don't know uh don't just mute
[1999.28 --> 2003.68]  it just in case it's muted that one oh
[2003.68 --> 2007.58]  sure cool okay sorry um so where was i
[2007.58 --> 2009.00]  going with this right right right right
[2009.00 --> 2011.44]  right i paid for the data why can't i use
[2011.44 --> 2012.90]  it on my laptop like i was trying to
[2012.90 --> 2014.98]  figure out a login problem with paypal and
[2014.98 --> 2016.88]  i was like freaking out and the mobile
[2016.88 --> 2019.32]  site wasn't working properly on my phone
[2019.32 --> 2021.90]  i was just like i would really like to
[2021.90 --> 2023.50]  use another device right now for like
[2023.50 --> 2025.84]  two minutes i just need to load a couple
[2025.84 --> 2030.66]  pages reset a password anyway sorry go
[2030.66 --> 2032.36]  ahead it's not like you're gonna not do
[2032.36 --> 2033.56]  it you're just gonna do it in a more
[2033.56 --> 2035.54]  annoying way google's including tethering
[2035.54 --> 2037.30]  so google's including it and then this is
[2037.30 --> 2039.40]  a really interesting pay model for data
[2039.40 --> 2043.16]  i like i don't know okay so it's a flat
[2043.16 --> 2045.28]  ten dollars per gigabyte of data in the
[2045.28 --> 2048.34]  u.s and abroad which is nuts for one but
[2048.34 --> 2050.42]  then if you don't use your data you get
[2050.42 --> 2053.04]  credit back for what you didn't use so if
[2053.04 --> 2055.46]  you go with a three gigabyte plan so it's
[2055.46 --> 2058.14]  thirty dollars and only use 1.4 gigabytes in
[2058.14 --> 2060.24]  a month you get sixteen dollars back and if
[2060.24 --> 2063.16]  you go over you only pay the same ten
[2063.16 --> 2064.02]  dollars per gigabyte
[2064.02 --> 2070.68]  what so why have a why isn't it all just
[2070.68 --> 2071.38]  flex plans
[2071.38 --> 2079.20]  right like what like i'm sitting here
[2079.20 --> 2081.74]  reading this but like okay isn't it gonna
[2081.74 --> 2083.74]  be a lot more work to deal with all the
[2083.74 --> 2084.78]  credits back and forth
[2084.78 --> 2088.22]  why don't you just make everything a
[2088.22 --> 2090.20]  flex plan anyways i don't know so if you
[2090.20 --> 2093.32]  go over your cap it's exactly the same as
[2093.32 --> 2094.94]  if you didn't go over your cap but had a
[2094.94 --> 2095.50]  higher cap
[2095.50 --> 2098.48]  so you can put like a data cap in your
[2098.48 --> 2100.44]  phone and cap it that way or you can
[2100.44 --> 2101.96]  just pay the same amount all the time
[2101.96 --> 2102.42]  and it's fine
[2102.42 --> 2105.90]  anyways so it's pay for only what you
[2105.90 --> 2106.74]  use which is great
[2106.74 --> 2108.38]  it requires not pay for only what you
[2108.38 --> 2109.78]  use it's pay for as much as you think
[2109.78 --> 2111.28]  you'll use and get credit back for what
[2111.28 --> 2111.94]  you didn't use
[2111.94 --> 2115.34]  i guess requires a special sim card for
[2115.34 --> 2117.86]  project 5 which makes sense uh works on
[2117.86 --> 2120.30]  both existing nexus nexus 6 devices and
[2120.30 --> 2121.84]  new ones so i don't know if it's only a
[2121.84 --> 2124.40]  nexus thing uh oh right available for
[2124.40 --> 2125.66]  only nexus 6 owners my bad
[2125.66 --> 2127.98]  um no contract no family plans
[2127.98 --> 2130.58]  available but it's pretty freaking cheap
[2130.58 --> 2133.82]  so whatever um phone numbers live in
[2133.82 --> 2136.28]  the cloud so you'd be able to make uh
[2136.28 --> 2138.64]  calls and do text messaging stuff from
[2138.64 --> 2140.44]  your computer through your phone number
[2140.44 --> 2142.70]  some that's definitely going to be a
[2142.70 --> 2144.26]  hangouts integration thing yeah that's
[2144.26 --> 2145.44]  going to be that's that's awesome i
[2145.44 --> 2146.62]  mean it was one of the things that i
[2146.62 --> 2148.92]  liked about um i forget i don't even
[2148.92 --> 2150.26]  remember what the word they have for it
[2150.26 --> 2152.04]  now is but when i had the imac and the
[2152.04 --> 2156.44]  iphone 6 at the same time um shoot i
[2156.44 --> 2157.70]  don't know whatever i don't remember
[2157.70 --> 2158.88]  what the word for it was but i could
[2158.88 --> 2160.44]  take calls on the imac which was a
[2160.44 --> 2161.88]  terrible experience because the
[2161.88 --> 2163.28]  microphone is on the back of the
[2163.28 --> 2164.70]  display because apparently apple's
[2164.70 --> 2166.18]  engineers don't understand how sound
[2166.18 --> 2166.58]  works
[2166.58 --> 2168.98]  but uh on a on a device that actually
[2168.98 --> 2170.90]  has a decent headphone microphone
[2170.90 --> 2172.20]  solution plugged into it that would be
[2172.20 --> 2173.42]  that would be awesome my phone could
[2173.42 --> 2175.20]  just stay in my pocket and i could just
[2175.20 --> 2176.74]  throw my headset on when i'm sitting at my
[2176.74 --> 2180.22]  computer at work freaking great yeah so
[2180.22 --> 2181.38]  i'm happy about that i think that's
[2181.38 --> 2181.80]  really cool
[2181.80 --> 2185.32]  um so it's invite only so there's that
[2185.32 --> 2187.96]  also uh looks like it's nexus 6 only
[2187.96 --> 2191.18]  for now so basically most people unless
[2191.18 --> 2193.58]  they have large hands and an invitation
[2193.58 --> 2196.42]  are not going to be taking advantage of
[2196.42 --> 2197.60]  this particular offer
[2197.60 --> 2201.58]  um all right uh yeah i'm sure it'll
[2201.58 --> 2203.10]  open up more later but for now it's
[2203.10 --> 2203.86]  pretty locked down
[2203.86 --> 2205.88]  i send invitations to people with large
[2205.88 --> 2206.24]  hands
[2206.24 --> 2214.30]  anyways doj which i don't know what
[2214.30 --> 2214.76]  that stands for
[2214.76 --> 2215.70]  department of justice
[2215.70 --> 2217.48]  cool they could stop comcast from
[2217.48 --> 2219.20]  becoming a mega terrible thing with
[2219.20 --> 2220.58]  time warner which is good because of
[2220.58 --> 2221.34]  antitrust laws
[2221.34 --> 2224.10]  um so apparently comcast has actually
[2224.10 --> 2226.82]  dropped its 45.2 billion dollar bid
[2226.82 --> 2229.94]  on time warner in light of uh the doj
[2229.94 --> 2231.60]  becoming mad and being like you can't
[2231.60 --> 2233.52]  do that i think they're gonna what is it
[2233.52 --> 2234.24]  actually called
[2234.24 --> 2237.38]  uh lawsuit they were gonna put down a
[2237.38 --> 2239.42]  federal lawsuit so then comcast was
[2239.42 --> 2240.16]  like nope
[2240.16 --> 2243.38]  um we don't even necessarily need to
[2243.38 --> 2244.48]  keep talking about it because i guess
[2244.48 --> 2246.08]  it's not happening but it could have
[2246.08 --> 2248.08]  made them control 30 percent of the
[2248.08 --> 2249.60]  market for pay tv which is
[2249.60 --> 2251.86]  a lot um they would have controlled
[2251.86 --> 2253.72]  more than 50 percent of broadband
[2253.72 --> 2255.56]  internet market in the united states
[2255.56 --> 2256.98]  which is a crap ton
[2256.98 --> 2260.46]  so i'm happy that the doj did something
[2260.46 --> 2262.94]  i i guess i just the thing that i
[2262.94 --> 2264.06]  don't um
[2264.06 --> 2267.36]  that like the the thing that continues
[2267.36 --> 2268.68]  to bother me though is that they're
[2268.68 --> 2270.62]  cozy enough that they wanted to merge
[2270.62 --> 2273.14]  so it's not like having them remain
[2273.14 --> 2274.50]  separate it's not like they're not
[2274.50 --> 2276.16]  gonna work together yeah it's it's it's
[2276.16 --> 2277.90]  not it's not like it's not like the
[2277.90 --> 2280.36]  consumer wins it's not like yeah
[2280.36 --> 2282.74]  choice free market already have been
[2282.74 --> 2284.26]  avoiding each other in terms of market
[2284.26 --> 2286.68]  share yeah so like that's not gonna
[2286.68 --> 2288.44]  stop it might even just get a little
[2288.44 --> 2290.44]  bit more aggressive that's all i i doubt
[2290.44 --> 2292.94]  it like why you already have enough
[2292.94 --> 2294.08]  money to buy the earth and all the
[2294.08 --> 2294.38]  heavens
[2294.38 --> 2296.06]  so no it might become more aggressive
[2296.06 --> 2298.40]  about not oh being in the same
[2298.40 --> 2300.04]  market share yeah like they might
[2300.04 --> 2301.56]  even just avoid each other more see
[2301.56 --> 2303.12]  it's funny because i thought you meant
[2303.12 --> 2304.50]  business aggressive but what you
[2304.50 --> 2306.22]  actually meant was just being a
[2306.22 --> 2308.26]  jackass aggressive okay well
[2308.26 --> 2310.34]  aggressively aggressively jackass we
[2310.34 --> 2312.94]  need like a shirt aggressively is
[2312.94 --> 2316.42]  such a nicely like a dynamic word
[2316.42 --> 2319.08]  because you can be aggressively in
[2319.08 --> 2320.16]  love with someone or you can
[2320.16 --> 2321.96]  aggressively hate no you can't or
[2321.96 --> 2325.34]  you can you can you can or something
[2325.34 --> 2327.88]  can have aggressive lines okay tell me
[2327.88 --> 2332.40]  tell me this uh okay hold on you're in
[2332.40 --> 2333.68]  love with someone and then someone
[2333.68 --> 2335.42]  smacks that person we're gonna we're
[2335.42 --> 2337.96]  gonna we're gonna straw pull this
[2337.96 --> 2341.24]  because if if it's like uh okay
[2341.24 --> 2349.60]  aggressive love uh yes no uh you know
[2349.60 --> 2351.44]  pursuing one's aims or intents
[2351.44 --> 2354.20]  forcefully sometimes unduly so hold on
[2354.20 --> 2356.54]  let's just can we just can we just put
[2356.54 --> 2358.52]  this out to the can we just put this out
[2358.52 --> 2360.74]  to the audience it it doesn't matter
[2360.74 --> 2364.00]  because words mean what we decide that
[2364.00 --> 2366.00]  words mean because without us you've
[2366.00 --> 2367.84]  defended the exact opposite of what you
[2367.84 --> 2370.52]  just said so many times can we all just
[2370.52 --> 2372.78]  calm down for a second half the twitch
[2372.78 --> 2374.50]  chat is talking about rape right now
[2374.50 --> 2375.82]  i didn't say it was a good thing
[2375.82 --> 2380.16]  oh okay i didn't say it was a good thing
[2380.16 --> 2381.84]  at all right all right okay so you're
[2381.84 --> 2384.84]  not saying it's a good thing but um
[2384.84 --> 2390.90]  because what i was gonna say is if if
[2390.90 --> 2393.84]  i'm you know staring into her eyes and
[2393.84 --> 2396.46]  and it's like okay i gotta think of like
[2396.46 --> 2397.98]  something charming to say right now
[2397.98 --> 2399.62]  that's not what i said am i gonna be like
[2399.62 --> 2401.70]  that's not what i said at all my love for
[2401.70 --> 2402.38]  you is aggressive
[2402.38 --> 2407.24]  no don't do that it attacks me
[2407.24 --> 2410.48]  don't do that it carves out chunks of my
[2410.48 --> 2413.92]  body and soul and takes it for itself i
[2413.92 --> 2416.08]  guess in like the right context if you
[2416.08 --> 2418.60]  were like a no there's no context an
[2418.60 --> 2421.08]  emo scene couple maybe what you just said
[2421.08 --> 2425.22]  no no i don't know no no i'm just
[2425.22 --> 2426.46]  putting the option out there the
[2426.46 --> 2427.88]  audience it's a bad one but they're
[2427.88 --> 2428.40]  wrong
[2428.40 --> 2430.70]  they're wrong it's like i now know what
[2430.70 --> 2432.58]  percentage of our audience is single
[2432.58 --> 2438.44]  aggressive love is it works it's just
[2438.44 --> 2441.20]  not necessarily a good thing it works
[2441.20 --> 2445.12]  terms don't have to be good okay i think
[2445.12 --> 2447.96]  it's time to i think it's time to uh to
[2447.96 --> 2450.30]  move on let's actually let's do our let's

[2537.68 --> 2539.20]  free trial
[2539.20 --> 2547.02]  yeah uh you know who's aggressive
[2547.02 --> 2550.44]  square space square space you don't
[2550.44 --> 2552.52]  even know the song no you haven't
[2552.52 --> 2554.34]  listened to the song since we did that
[2554.34 --> 2556.06]  spot meaning i never listened to the
[2556.06 --> 2557.48]  song because i didn't have headphones why
[2557.48 --> 2558.96]  do you even the only one that could hear
[2558.96 --> 2561.18]  it why do you even try square space
[2561.18 --> 2564.06]  build it beautiful no that's okay that
[2564.06 --> 2566.22]  is their new slogan or not as new since
[2566.22 --> 2568.04]  the song but that's not how okay
[2568.04 --> 2571.22]  square space actually has a pretty
[2571.22 --> 2573.56]  aggressive thing going on right now
[2573.56 --> 2579.02]  if you go to nycommit.squarespace.com
[2579.02 --> 2583.22]  they are aggressively seeking new software
[2583.22 --> 2586.32]  engineers and if you get an interview you
[2586.32 --> 2589.06]  actually get to come to new york and
[2589.06 --> 2591.22]  experience the city as part of the
[2591.22 --> 2593.14]  interview process and it's not like if
[2593.14 --> 2595.36]  you don't end up getting hired or anything
[2595.36 --> 2597.56]  like that they like make you pay for it or
[2597.56 --> 2600.26]  something so just just getting an interview
[2600.26 --> 2602.98]  is good enough to go down and get a taste of
[2602.98 --> 2605.88]  the city that made square space possible and
[2605.88 --> 2608.44]  if you guys don't know what square space is at
[2608.44 --> 2610.68]  all at this point for only eight bucks a month
[2610.68 --> 2613.82]  to start you get a domain if you buy square space for a year
[2613.82 --> 2617.78]  and it's an easy platform to build a beautiful functional website that works
[2617.78 --> 2623.46]  on your computer your phone or even other people's computers and phones so you
[2623.46 --> 2626.34]  won't be the only one to visit your website i mean that would be good you
[2626.34 --> 2629.04]  might be the only one to visit your website there's nothing square space can
[2629.04 --> 2632.42]  do about that but if people visit your website whether it's your blog your
[2632.42 --> 2637.08]  store or your portfolio they will have a good experience and they will feel
[2637.08 --> 2640.72]  like you are competent enough to have a website you could apply to
[2640.72 --> 2644.44]  squarespace get a trip to new york and start a blog about your trip to new york
[2644.44 --> 2647.68]  on squarespace that would probably even help your application
[2647.68 --> 2652.72]  so uh go to squarespace.com and use offer code linus to save
[2652.72 --> 2659.08]  you know this is why i really truly wonder how we even get through sponsor
[2659.08 --> 2664.56]  spots when i'm not here because your entire purpose for being here when i'm
[2664.56 --> 2671.38]  trying to talk about freshbooks.com for example seems to be to throw me off which
[2671.38 --> 2676.76]  i will not allow you to do freshbooks is an online tool to allow you to focus on
[2676.76 --> 2680.02]  your business and i don't mean toilet business this isn't a dollar shave club
[2680.02 --> 2683.48]  spot it could be what if you're a plumber okay
[2683.48 --> 2687.64]  actually the plumber example is a good one because we even tied your dad into this
[2687.64 --> 2691.56]  last time did your mom see that i don't think so did your dad see it i
[2691.56 --> 2694.68]  neither of them have commented so maybe they both saw it and they're just like
[2694.68 --> 2699.20]  nope just not going to talk about that it's very possible so luke's dad's problem
[2699.20 --> 2704.08]  all right seems to be uh to do with billing okay he had no problem coming in
[2704.08 --> 2708.52]  and installing a fantastic copper pipe liquid cooling system for us
[2708.52 --> 2711.58]  but when it came time to send us the bill for his work
[2711.58 --> 2716.38]  it took him uh just about the gestation period of a human
[2716.38 --> 2722.14]  to actually give me an invoice with freshbooks you can do that stuff online
[2722.14 --> 2726.44]  you can log your hours so you know how to bill your clients you can send invoices
[2726.44 --> 2730.78]  by email and then you can even get confirmations when they've looked at the
[2730.78 --> 2733.18]  invoice and have people pay by credit card
[2733.18 --> 2737.76]  for the utmost simplicity so you can spend your time running your business as
[2737.76 --> 2741.08]  opposed to dealing with tedious accounting things
[2741.08 --> 2745.30]  it's all cloud-based so you can take it with you on your phone or you can work on
[2745.30 --> 2748.38]  it on your computer and if you visit freshbooks.com slash when
[2748.38 --> 2754.90]  you can claim your free trial today to try it out and decide if you like it
[2754.90 --> 2760.20]  see i didn't let you screw me up i didn't even who was that sponsor i used to
[2760.20 --> 2764.80]  always get the amount wrong for remember i used to never know how much it
[2764.80 --> 2765.18]  cost
[2765.18 --> 2770.08]  yeah i think i think that's the one i think that is the one i don't know
[2770.08 --> 2779.22]  yeah i screwed up nothing today ha take that all of you all right so uh what do
[2779.22 --> 2783.46]  we have 11 pages of topics today we've actually been fairly on topic today and
[2783.46 --> 2787.08]  we're still like there's a lot of rapid fire stuff we're still
[2787.08 --> 2793.04]  boned all right so norway this is phenomenal norway will be the first
[2793.04 --> 2799.76]  country to shut down fm radio the ministry of culture has finalized a
[2799.76 --> 2805.92]  transition date in 2017 and i think this is asinine there's a lot of technological
[2805.92 --> 2814.00]  advancements that i believe in but there are advantages to radio that
[2814.00 --> 2823.14]  are not necessarily overcome by mobile data networks um i i yeah okay yeah
[2823.14 --> 2828.60]  yeah so it's not like it's not like there isn't you know another plan so it'll be
[2828.60 --> 2834.22]  digital audio broadcasting also known as dab which will offer better audio quality
[2834.22 --> 2837.90]  plus sorry specifically plus the dab radios will not work
[2837.90 --> 2841.74]  uh so better audio quality other functionality like showing information about the
[2841.74 --> 2845.92]  station you're listening to and what song is playing which by the way we have
[2845.92 --> 2851.62]  on fm radio um so that's a thing uh the transition will cost norway the
[2851.62 --> 2857.88]  equivalent of 1.3 billion u.s dollars and the 200 000 dab radios will become
[2857.88 --> 2862.32]  useless as they don't support dab plus they've already started advertising for
[2862.32 --> 2868.60]  the switch you get more radio in a digital radio and i i just i plain don't get
[2868.60 --> 2876.68]  it because the reality of it is we use fm radio because it's cheap because it's got
[2876.68 --> 2882.26]  great legacy compatibility and because it's good enough both in terms of
[2882.26 --> 2887.60]  broadcast range and in terms of audio quality i mean we can get radio stations
[2887.60 --> 2892.40]  from seattle up here i do want time which i do all the time if you want
[2892.40 --> 2898.04]  to reach a bunch of people radio is still a great way to do it because the
[2898.04 --> 2905.72]  reality of it is pretty much everyone still owns at least one radio and we can
[2905.72 --> 2909.24]  kind of count on that to work like when everyone you know jumps on their cell
[2909.24 --> 2913.70]  phones in an emergency radio is yeah i was just gonna say radio is a lot of time
[2913.70 --> 2919.82]  the emergency frequencies yeah so and and i i get it dab plus radios are not cell
[2919.82 --> 2924.36]  phones but we're counting on people to have them so the people who don't have
[2924.36 --> 2928.80]  those and we can't necessarily reach by cell phone or mobile data because let's
[2928.80 --> 2932.00]  say there's an emergency and everyone jumps on it and it's totally congested
[2932.00 --> 2935.72]  radio is going to be the way to reach these people i don't understand why we need to
[2935.72 --> 2940.40]  phase this out someone in chat said that they live in norway and it just seems
[2940.40 --> 2942.30]  like they always just want the newest stuff
[2942.30 --> 2950.30]  all right well newest is not necessarily always the best thing i mean i i actually
[2950.30 --> 2954.62]  had a really i had a good conversation with brandon about the uh some of the new cameras
[2954.62 --> 2959.18]  that were released at nab so uh those of you who were following our nab coverage
[2959.18 --> 2964.96]  probably less than half of you based on the view counts um would know that there was a it was about
[2964.96 --> 2970.62]  half of our normal view counts even for show coverage uh would know that red released an 8k
[2970.62 --> 2976.00]  sensor upgrade to their red whatever it is whichever platform it is i think it's the dragon
[2976.00 --> 2982.88]  um so this is called the red weapon and i think whatever i think the camera once you put the upgrade
[2982.88 --> 2988.34]  in it is called a red weapon it's very confusing because they had the because if you upgraded the red
[2988.34 --> 2994.62]  epic to the new sensor it became a red dragon and then yeah anyway so i didn't think the weapon
[2994.62 --> 3000.48]  was an upgrade i thought you had to like buy the weapon not sure anyway you could uh exchange
[3000.48 --> 3005.56]  and then it's 20 grand or 10 grand or something it was 10 grand at the show 20 grand after the point
[3005.56 --> 3009.78]  is they have an 8k sensor and i was i was talking to brandon about it because marcus has ordered
[3009.78 --> 3015.62]  one already as we know and uh we were we were just kind of talking about it going why would we
[3015.62 --> 3022.54]  be using this um 4k is already i mean sort of i'm gonna let you guys in on a little secret
[3022.54 --> 3028.50]  uh we were releasing 4k videos on youtube that were up sampled 1080p for a long time nobody ever
[3028.50 --> 3035.66]  noticed no one can tell because the main advantage of 4k playback on youtube right now is the higher
[3035.66 --> 3042.52]  bit rate um and when you factor in also that the cameras that we shoot on the sony fs 700 and the
[3042.52 --> 3050.16]  panasonic gh4 both have 4k sensors so their 1080p is actually down sampled it's like super sampled
[3050.16 --> 3056.16]  because it's down sampled 4k when you blow that back up it looks pretty darn freaking good
[3056.16 --> 3060.78]  anyway especially at any kind of reasonable viewing distance so unless you're pixel peeping
[3060.78 --> 3066.08]  4k is way more than enough for web video and to which i kind of went well there's the future
[3066.08 --> 3070.90]  proofness argument maybe you need more pixels in case you want to republish am i ever going to
[3070.90 --> 3076.56]  republish a youtube video on like some kind of futuristic you know five ten years from now platform
[3076.56 --> 3082.68]  probably not so we were we were talking about it a little bit and we kind of decided that 4k is
[3082.68 --> 3087.84]  already more than enough for us so we'll be sticking with 4k and i just feel like shooting at a higher
[3087.84 --> 3093.22]  resolution is going to complicate the workflow in a way that is just not worthwhile to me i mean if
[3093.22 --> 3097.68]  you're just one person working on it i guess i can see why marcus would like to do it because he's got
[3097.68 --> 3102.02]  the time to kind of tinker around with it and play with it and only one person has to learn a new
[3102.02 --> 3108.20]  workflow with us we're trying to figure out okay maybe we could invest that you know ten thousand
[3108.20 --> 3116.40]  or twenty thousand dollars on back-end equipment that makes the 4k workflow butter smooth and
[3116.40 --> 3122.28]  absolutely perfect as opposed to yeah so so things like like storage servers that's something that a
[3122.28 --> 3130.58]  lot of content creators completely ignore for some inexplicable reason is having a proper storage
[3130.58 --> 3136.68]  setup which is what we're moving to finally so and and that's the kind of thing that for the price
[3136.68 --> 3143.54]  of something like a decked out mac pro and like you know a red weapon for example you could have an
[3143.54 --> 3150.66]  amazing workflow as opposed to a couple of really cool pieces of equipment so i guess it's a priorities
[3150.66 --> 3157.92]  thing and also a scale thing because i'm not going to go and buy 12 core mac pros for four editors
[3157.92 --> 3162.74]  that is like straight up not happening whereas if it was for one then maybe you could pull my
[3162.74 --> 3172.12]  you know twist my arm a little bit yeah um google is uh yeah wow look at that is ditching the old
[3172.12 --> 3177.72]  youtube api so let's go ahead probably as big of a deal as it sounds um for instance the linus
[3177.72 --> 3182.74]  tech tips dot com website used v2 and now uses v3
[3182.74 --> 3190.34]  okay i don't know um not a huge deal they will have to retroactively update devices so
[3190.34 --> 3196.80]  things that use the v2 api such as some smart tvs android and apple tvs game certain game consoles
[3196.80 --> 3202.64]  ios devices that are old and outdated stuff like that yeah um would need an update but it's not like
[3202.64 --> 3208.10]  they can't be updated well an ios 5 locked device might not be able to be updated so you might
[3208.10 --> 3213.44]  straight up not be able to use youtube if you're using an apple tv second generation or older there's
[3213.44 --> 3219.34]  no current way to watch youtube on these devices straight up that's pretty brutal so that's really
[3219.34 --> 3226.22]  sucky i guess um i guess we learned a lesson about buying functionality locked boxes yeah
[3226.22 --> 3235.70]  pc for life it just won't really affect like your website things yeah so it's fine because like
[3235.70 --> 3240.92]  every website ever was like oh and then just updated it by the way thank you colonel mortis
[3240.92 --> 3249.90]  oh my goodness colonel mortis yeah why that was posted by alex goes hi oh okay right we should
[3249.90 --> 3257.78]  probably be saying who posted lord sparkle bottom roozy top war gamer cool kingler one i like mac and pc
[3257.78 --> 3267.56]  um syntax vgm lord sparkle bottom again and alex goes hi have given us the news for this week so far
[3267.56 --> 3273.94]  and wordo 165 i both appreciate your effort and wish you had never brought this to our attention at all
[3273.94 --> 3281.82]  because this is basically the worst news of the week steam has introduced a new way to support workshop
[3281.82 --> 3287.96]  creators and line the pockets of valve executives wait they don't have that second part in the
[3287.96 --> 3294.48]  in the smallest possible way and line the pockets of valve executives as much as possible starting with
[3294.48 --> 3301.70]  the elder schools 5 skyrim of course of course it does buying from the steam workshop try any mod risk
[3301.70 --> 3307.70]  free for 24 hours nothing to do with long-term support though that's kind of funny buying mods and
[3307.70 --> 3314.32]  made by like you know casuals that don't have to support it at all after that wow that's really weird
[3314.32 --> 3321.04]  so uh with over 24 000 free mods i guess there's nothing here about the ones that are becoming paid
[3321.04 --> 3328.42]  very quickly now that there is a price on it and uh calling all creators uh earn money doing what you love
[3328.42 --> 3335.12]  yeah set your own price that's cool you can add contributors and uh where's the where's the part
[3335.12 --> 3344.72]  about the 25 percent hold on 75 percent oh that's not on here that's weird so let's let's dive into this
[3344.72 --> 3350.80]  this is very much a developing story right now so everything we're saying now um take it as the
[3350.80 --> 3355.20]  information that we had in sort of the hours leading up to wan show today and not much more than that
[3355.20 --> 3362.12]  but um i guess i'm let's go with just the facts then i think each of us will probably have to weigh
[3362.12 --> 3366.28]  in separately because i think we're going to have kind of differing opinions here sure um so why don't
[3366.28 --> 3371.00]  we just do the facts the initiative was introduced yesterday pitched as a way to support the people
[3371.00 --> 3375.66]  that made the mods i mean we saw that on the page uh compensating these creators as a way to inspire
[3375.66 --> 3381.26]  new modders to try their hand at creating new higher quality items and experiences uh you can make
[3381.26 --> 3386.34]  cosmetic items sound packs custom skins fancy houses epic quests entire new cities horse genitals
[3386.34 --> 3393.52]  whatever the case may be for elder scrolls 5 skyrim um many more of your favorite workshop games will
[3393.52 --> 3398.74]  support paid content in the coming weeks and they offer refunds for mods that are broken or don't work
[3398.74 --> 3407.30]  as promised within 24 hours of your purchase the sort of stuff that wasn't on the page uh that was
[3407.30 --> 3412.42]  discovered later and has outraged some consumers and presumably some creators is that the creator
[3412.42 --> 3420.60]  only receives 25 percent of the revenue from the mod sale so a 10 mod is actually giving two dollars and
[3420.60 --> 3428.38]  fifty cents to your favorite creator and seven dollars and fifty cents to valve there's um i guess let's
[3428.38 --> 3435.44]  let you go first you're you're running with it i can go first okay yeah one thing let's hear your opinion
[3435.44 --> 3441.76]  one thing is i i we like total biscuit here he's been on the show before he has a video on it his content
[3441.76 --> 3448.22]  patch number 195 is all about this and he's probably way more well informed than we are so we will talk
[3448.22 --> 3452.56]  about it for sure but i actually highly suggest going and checking out his thing i have not watched it
[3452.56 --> 3457.36]  yet um i'll watch it later i didn't know there was a thing i will also watch it later i'm very interested
[3457.36 --> 3462.26]  in what he has to say about it good old john bain um i don't like this for a number of reasons
[3462.26 --> 3470.44]  first off is the 24 hour support thing what hey um people are like going off and chat about this
[3470.44 --> 3477.14]  there's more information that came out apparently the 75 percent is 45 developer 30 valve like 45
[3477.14 --> 3487.68]  original game developer okay okay so i'm just i'm just 75 valve okay all right so 45 45 game developer
[3487.68 --> 3493.00]  yep 30 valve 25 mod developer that's what people in the chat are saying okay
[3493.00 --> 3499.68]  okay that's interesting good to know um doesn't really change my opinion on it okay so carry on
[3499.68 --> 3506.20]  then yes um well maybe slightly but not enough to really make an impact so a big part of my issue
[3506.20 --> 3510.32]  with this is that a lot of mods break things straight up break things they can corrupt save files
[3510.32 --> 3515.36]  sometimes they can make this that you can maybe the save file isn't corrupted but you can't play it with
[3515.36 --> 3521.58]  that mod and you can't play without that mod so it's useless um there's there's they can conflict
[3521.58 --> 3529.74]  like crazy um there's just a huge amount of issues with mods and that's fine when they're all free but
[3529.74 --> 3534.30]  what what happens if you have a whole bunch of free mods installed and then you install a paid one and
[3534.30 --> 3538.64]  it breaks all your free ones or the other way around you have a whole bunch of paid mods installed
[3538.64 --> 3543.62]  you install a free one it breaks all of those it doesn't matter for 24 hours and like okay if it breaks
[3543.62 --> 3549.74]  my whole save i don't care about the one dollar and 50 cents that the mod cost me i care about the
[3549.74 --> 3553.92]  hundreds and hundreds of potential hours that i have into this game we're talking about stuff like
[3553.92 --> 3559.66]  skyrim i could have played that game for 800 hours have a whole bunch of content mods installed that
[3559.66 --> 3565.60]  like double quadruple the actual game length massively increase what i'm doing i could have been playing
[3565.60 --> 3570.36]  on that one character the whole time and it could be totally screwed because of that yeah you can say
[3570.36 --> 3573.42]  you should be backing up your save file you should be doing all this other kind of stuff but still
[3573.42 --> 3578.00]  it's going to happen to someone and that's that's crazy you only have a 24 hour window to get your
[3578.00 --> 3583.84]  money back and getting your money back isn't even the biggest problem there okay continuing on past
[3583.84 --> 3592.46]  that part the 75 thing is ridiculous 45 goes to the game oh for just including mod support like i'm
[3592.46 --> 3597.34]  totally down with supporting the game developer and sure maybe some percentage of it should go to the game
[3597.34 --> 3603.22]  developer because we want to encourage them to actually have stuff like mod support and with single player
[3603.22 --> 3609.30]  experiences like skyrim where is their recurring revenue nothing yeah exactly so i'm actually i'm cool
[3609.30 --> 3618.42]  with giving some of the money to the game 45 is really high i think they need to invert this whole system
[3618.42 --> 3626.66]  i think valve needs to get maybe 25 i think the game needs to get maybe 30 then i think the mod developer
[3626.66 --> 3634.52]  needs to get probably more than 45 i think it needs to be completely flipped anyways if it even keeps
[3634.52 --> 3638.78]  those percentages at all yeah i don't think that added to 100 but i get your point that's the numbers
[3638.78 --> 3644.24]  you gave me oh 45 30 and 20 that's why i'm like what oh i thought i got confused when you were oh okay
[3644.24 --> 3649.32]  no no i know it doesn't work there's five percent no it's 25 25 25 mod yeah 25 mod that's your problem
[3649.32 --> 3654.78]  um okay so i i have some thoughts on this as well so there's there's a couple of things one
[3654.78 --> 3660.64]  very positive takeaway from this is you see the big blockbuster games like your skyrim hold up hold
[3660.64 --> 3665.34]  up see this is what people are that's a whole that's a whole other that's a whole other thing
[3665.34 --> 3670.68]  400 total yeah we can we can talk about the we can talk about the fact that people are stealing mods
[3670.68 --> 3677.74]  and re-uploading them um and valve will not pay the yeah there's a there's a 400 cap anyway
[3677.74 --> 3685.00]  all of these little rules are basically just sort of piling on to the crappiness that is getting
[3685.00 --> 3690.14]  dealt to the modder and all of this in in all of this stuff i was actually reading up on a couple of
[3690.14 --> 3695.16]  these things as you were talking but there's a couple main main sort of bigger picture things that
[3695.16 --> 3701.66]  i that i want to address here so number one is that it makes sense to me that the game developers
[3701.66 --> 3708.36]  who are spending the time to develop these great single player experiences are getting paid for it
[3708.36 --> 3713.98]  i mean we we see mod support with games like grand theft auto and with games like elder scrolls where
[3713.98 --> 3719.24]  these are big budget games where they're expecting to sell uh you know a thousand bazillion copies
[3719.24 --> 3726.84]  and pretty much okay we don't have any recurring revenue from this game but it's okay because we're
[3726.84 --> 3731.70]  going to make that massive amount of money and there's going to be a really long tail on the sales
[3731.70 --> 3737.20]  for years like you you could still buy oblivion and it would still be a great gaming experience today
[3737.20 --> 3744.18]  even though it's been out for like eight years or something along those lines so i so so the blockbuster
[3744.18 --> 3750.04]  games they can include mod support kind of without worrying about it too much but what incentivizes a
[3750.04 --> 3758.46]  smaller game developer to build a great single player experience almost nothing why are we why do
[3758.46 --> 3764.94]  we see a billion you know online online multiplayer games why do we see a billion mobas with you know
[3764.94 --> 3770.60]  microtransactions for skins why do we see everyone in their dog i mean this was more of an issue five or
[3770.60 --> 3775.70]  six years ago but why did we see everyone in their dog trying to build an mmo because game developers
[3775.70 --> 3781.54]  want a recurring revenue stream for their work and they want to keep going ahead and working on it
[3781.54 --> 3789.12]  and developing it now with all of that said do i think taking 45 percent of the revenue for the
[3789.12 --> 3795.92]  developer as opposed to the modder who is the one actually extending the usability of the product and
[3795.92 --> 3801.90]  potentially driving new sales of that product to new users based on the whether it's missions or
[3801.90 --> 3808.14]  whether it's new texture packs that make people want to reinvest in this game or or buy the game
[3808.14 --> 3812.82]  when they haven't played it before do i think that the game developers should be getting the lion's
[3812.82 --> 3820.06]  share of this deal absolutely not are they supporting the mod are they are they are they
[3820.06 --> 3825.30]  creating a system yeah are they creating a system where they're they're certain that the mod will be
[3825.30 --> 3831.34]  whitelisting things are they qc-ing it are they making it so you can roll back the mod are they are they
[3831.34 --> 3837.96]  creating a mod module so you can manage your mods really well and so that if something does damage
[3837.96 --> 3841.80]  to something you can easily undo it are they putting these systems in places that is that what
[3841.80 --> 3848.86]  the 45 percent is for i doubt it what about valves 30 percent i mean you look at the people blatantly
[3848.86 --> 3855.38]  uploading stolen mods already taking advantage of the system is valve investing their 30 percent in
[3855.38 --> 3859.54]  painstakingly going through the mods and making sure that they work that would fall under customer
[3859.54 --> 3865.08]  service so no right well i'm okay we all knew the answer to this i was i was being i know i was
[3865.08 --> 3873.90]  taking a shot of the customer um and then and then as for as for the dev the 25 percent is completely
[3873.90 --> 3881.40]  unreasonable as a youtube creator it's it's it's a source of friction between youtube creators and
[3881.40 --> 3889.38]  google that google takes 45 percent when ultimately we are creating the content that sits on their
[3889.38 --> 3895.50]  platform now with that said i've accepted the 45 percent youtube tax and i've made a really good
[3895.50 --> 3903.34]  living for myself and for the people around me with the 45 percent youtube tax with abandoning that to
[3903.34 --> 3909.70]  them and all of that good stuff because sorry hosting videos is going to be a lot more of an overhead
[3909.70 --> 3915.16]  yeah the the back end that google needed to do the storage of all of our videos the distribution of
[3915.16 --> 3921.76]  all the videos and stuff is much harder than the really small and youtube brought us a really big
[3921.76 --> 3930.34]  audience compared to what valve is offering modders simply by listing mods the way that you were already
[3930.34 --> 3937.20]  able to do in the workshop um so so the youtube platform has contributed enough that i kind of go
[3937.20 --> 3943.56]  oh crap that's a lot of money but yeah fine i like i get it you actually have ongoing overhead
[3943.56 --> 3951.64]  associated with with supporting me it sucks but it's understandable yes with this system unless valve
[3951.64 --> 3959.38]  is contributing a lot more than it seems like they are i mean i get it bandwidth is expensive totally get
[3959.38 --> 3964.64]  that but that's the kind of thing where you could have the modder actually just pay per use or something
[3964.64 --> 3970.78]  like that uh because there's there's no there's no real reason why a very very small mod needs to
[3970.78 --> 3977.24]  have a bunch of bandwidth costs associated with it and i think 25 is a completely unreasonable amount
[3977.24 --> 3985.34]  of money to offer someone who actually did all of the work literally all of it i mean in many cases
[3985.34 --> 3990.16]  these mods have their own dedicated websites where you can go and visit the developer blog
[3990.16 --> 3993.94]  find out what's coming find out what's not coming the ones that are well supported
[3993.94 --> 4000.22]  especially deserve a proper amount of money for what they're doing something interesting one thing i have
[4000.22 --> 4006.22]  to butt in about is gta has no official mod support oh thank you it's it's uh there's there's a bunch
[4006.22 --> 4011.74]  of games that do um but anyways but at least it is moddable there are games that are a lot more
[4011.74 --> 4016.32]  difficult there won't be like a workshop thing for it yeah no no that's anyways yeah that's fine yeah
[4016.32 --> 4024.12]  um oh crap what was i gonna say now oh i forgot after that if you're stuck the the the people that are
[4024.12 --> 4028.36]  supporting their own mods and stuff a lot of the times they'll have donate options and donate
[4028.36 --> 4032.46]  options it's all going to go to them except for like the little paypal cut or whatever yeah but
[4032.46 --> 4037.58]  like the one point that's so much more worth it to these people two point whatever percent um so much
[4037.58 --> 4044.76]  more worth it so okay so so so but with all that said so i'm super upset about the way this whole
[4044.76 --> 4050.88]  thing is structured i think it makes absolutely no sense but there is something that i've seen people
[4050.88 --> 4059.00]  upset about that has really annoyed me as as a content creator the idea that mods should be free
[4059.00 --> 4069.36]  why if it's crappy sure but don't pay for it if it's crappy then they're gonna release the mod
[4069.36 --> 4074.50]  they're gonna get a couple of one star reviews on whatever marketplace it happens to be i'm okay with
[4074.50 --> 4078.94]  like super bass huge content mods or whatever costing money that's fine yeah that's your problem but but
[4078.94 --> 4082.88]  but no i know i know you're not gonna have a problem with this but and people are saying
[4082.88 --> 4088.10]  modders can still upload for free if they want and that's fine but why should they if modders are
[4088.10 --> 4094.56]  putting a lot of work into this why shouldn't they make money doing it i mean the whole internet
[4094.56 --> 4100.76]  mentality that everyone should do everything as a passion project um doesn't make a lot of sense to me
[4100.76 --> 4108.44]  because with monetary investment from the users comes i believe and and i mean this is my
[4108.44 --> 4114.18]  principles as a content creator should come better investment into the quality of the content
[4114.18 --> 4120.54]  i mean if a mod is as amazing as it is and it's free and it's something that someone did purely as a
[4120.54 --> 4126.42]  passion project imagine if you freed up that person's time by making it so they didn't have to have a day
[4126.42 --> 4132.56]  job anymore if that person has you know some principles that they stand on where they believe
[4132.56 --> 4135.80]  that if they're getting paid they should work hard and they should do a good job
[4135.80 --> 4141.42]  that should in turn turn into a better quality mod for you to enjoy and maybe it costs you four
[4141.42 --> 4146.14]  dollars and 95 cents or whatever the case may be i don't understand why people are upset about that
[4146.14 --> 4153.12]  at all i just have a problem with you know the four dollar 95 cent mod ultimately turning into a
[4153.12 --> 4158.46]  buck 25 in the pocket of the modder because that is a lot i mean when we consider what a mod is going to
[4158.46 --> 4164.76]  cost i would expect most mods to be and you can buy a game on steam for you know under 20 bucks a lot of
[4164.76 --> 4171.02]  the time like a good game an older triple a game even so i don't expect mods to go for 20 bucks very
[4171.02 --> 4177.94]  often so when we're talking about five dollar mods or you know ten dollar mods expecting people to live
[4177.94 --> 4184.68]  off of an average revenue per transaction of a dollar fifty to two dollars and a buck twenty five
[4184.68 --> 4191.78]  to two dollars and fifty cents is absolutely ridiculous and unreasonable and frankly insulting
[4191.78 --> 4198.12]  so that's what someone's saying hold on a second you're not taking into account the major modders
[4198.12 --> 4202.42]  are not wanting this who cares then they can release their mod for free it's about choice
[4202.42 --> 4209.10]  the community being upset makes no sense if a modder wants to do something where they want to turn
[4209.10 --> 4214.68]  you know they're modding they're modding passion into a business why shouldn't they be able to do
[4214.68 --> 4219.58]  their passion i'm sure a lot of people are still going to release uh mods for free especially a lot
[4219.58 --> 4224.54]  of the just like texture mod things where or not even just texture mods but uh actually specifically
[4224.54 --> 4228.76]  not texture mods got someone saying linus your car is being stolen no that wouldn't have been my car
[4228.76 --> 4233.32]  it doesn't have no alarm and it's not it's not locked so they wouldn't have to break into it
[4233.32 --> 4241.14]  fantastic now everyone knows your car's unlocked um anyways though like here's a single sword which
[4241.14 --> 4246.06]  i actually found kind of funny was a lot of the ones that you're able to currently pay for i think a
[4246.06 --> 4250.32]  lot of that kind of stuff might stay free because people are going to go like oh i want to design a
[4250.32 --> 4253.98]  sword and they'll go and like design a sword for skyrim and be like oh that's pretty cool all right
[4253.98 --> 4258.76]  people can have it like i think that'll happen quite a bit i don't think people are just going to
[4258.76 --> 4262.50]  stop modding out of passion because now there's a potential way to make money yep
[4262.50 --> 4269.24]  but i mean like i don't know so for me personally the fact that i could make a business out of youtube
[4269.24 --> 4274.76]  inspired me to build a team and to make much higher quality content i think we can all agree
[4274.76 --> 4280.46]  that what we're doing now is light years ahead of what i was able to do on my own back when i
[4280.46 --> 4285.32]  didn't have this awesome team around me and i would like to believe that there will be the basement
[4285.32 --> 4288.94]  modders who don't want to be paid and just want to do it for fun and don't want the pressure
[4288.94 --> 4294.68]  of customers that's a real thing not wanting the pressure of people who are paying for your content
[4294.68 --> 4299.82]  wanting people to have it for free so that if like that's something goes wrong you can just go whoa
[4299.82 --> 4305.40]  hey yeah well this was free dude it comes with all the warranties associated with free stuff that's
[4305.40 --> 4309.82]  sometimes i brought this up earlier i forgot about it that's actually one of the reasons why i was
[4309.82 --> 4314.14]  scared about this and one of the reasons why i like buying things sometimes because if i buy something
[4314.14 --> 4319.08]  and it breaks there's someone that i can hold accountable yep and i can be like hey fix this
[4319.08 --> 4325.48]  i paid for it fix it or else i'll like bring hell on you as much as i possibly can um if i'm downloading
[4325.48 --> 4332.20]  stuff for free if anything goes wrong with it i'm just like okay i'll submit a bug report or like try
[4332.20 --> 4338.06]  to fix it myself and if neither of those things work then i guess that's about how that goes
[4338.06 --> 4344.36]  i've got a lot of people talking about how modders if they want to go legit in their business so this
[4344.36 --> 4348.90]  is this is more of an okay so two things number one people want us to talk about the 400 payment
[4348.90 --> 4354.88]  threshold from valve which is nonsense by the way that is ridiculous the typical payment threshold is
[4354.88 --> 4359.72]  a hundred dollars for things like google adsense uh well for things like google adsense if you're
[4359.72 --> 4365.56]  gonna have actually affiliate programs that i've been part of um i think amazon's is a hundred dollars
[4365.56 --> 4370.22]  when you make a hundred dollars yeah it's when you make the same as this no it's 400 no you get
[4370.22 --> 4377.36]  a hundred dollars when you make a hundred dollars yeah okay yeah it's the same thing but it's not but
[4377.36 --> 4381.58]  much less because lots of mods will never like you could make a sword and you could be like this is a
[4381.58 --> 4387.34]  one dollar sword and 350 people might buy it and you will never get your your one hundred dollar check
[4387.34 --> 4392.44]  i believe it was nick or ghost or i don't know someone just updated this you need to get a hundred
[4392.44 --> 4397.00]  dollars before you can withdraw the funds so you must sell at least four hundred dollars yeah
[4397.00 --> 4402.42]  before you can withdraw the funds um and then shoot there was something else that uh that people were
[4402.42 --> 4409.52]  bringing up on uh that people are bringing up that i wanted to address right um so the whole thing about
[4409.52 --> 4415.50]  about modders a lot of them kind of being kind of gray and sketch because they're releasing it for free
[4415.50 --> 4422.20]  so a lot of them are not using paid versions of the often very expensive software that's involved in
[4422.20 --> 4428.32]  3d modeling and game creation um so honestly that's the kind of thing that is just going to have to be
[4428.32 --> 4432.62]  up to the modders the ones that want to continue to do it for free and fly under the radar i think
[4432.62 --> 4436.58]  are going to be put under a lot less scrutiny than the ones that decide to go okay yeah i'm going to make
[4436.58 --> 4439.80]  a business out of this we're going to make items we're going to make game mods we're going to make
[4439.80 --> 4447.08]  texture packs and i guess i better invest in some actual software now because i mean honestly there's um
[4447.08 --> 4453.96]  there there's there's not a lot that valve or the game developer can do to police this and people are
[4453.96 --> 4458.28]  just going to have to be responsible and if they're not able to be responsible that's ultimately going
[4458.28 --> 4463.40]  to be on them which is which is sort of just yet yet another thing like we're putting all the extra
[4463.40 --> 4471.26]  overhead on the modder for their 25 that they get out of this out of this whole thing yeah the whole
[4471.26 --> 4480.76]  thing is ridiculous and yeah i don't know i actually didn't really read our notes i was just
[4480.76 --> 4484.40]  going off the top of my head on a lot of this well a lot of this has been updated while we've been
[4484.40 --> 4490.58]  sitting here um so there's that um one of the interesting things too is going to be the people
[4490.58 --> 4497.56]  that potentially make it a paid mod on the workshop and a free mod um in other ways like if you install
[4497.56 --> 4501.64]  it through like skyrim nexus or whatever yeah to make it a free mod that way and a paid mod on the
[4501.64 --> 4506.52]  workshop that could be fairly interesting that could pull people away from the whole workshop platform
[4506.52 --> 4517.18]  but then that'll only work for certain games i guess i don't know um i don't know what else to
[4517.18 --> 4524.46]  talk about we've got like 12 minutes left um gamers in the uk showing a tendency of uh curbing pre-order
[4524.46 --> 4527.50]  habits yeah i guess there's not really a whole lot to say about that did you ever post the
[4527.50 --> 4534.02]  link for the valve thing i think so okay cool um 20 of uk gamers have said that they have either
[4534.02 --> 4540.04]  stopped pre-ordering or pre-ordered less games um there's more information in that article but it's
[4540.04 --> 4546.92]  not a ton more information so that's cool it looks like um you know i was actually totally down to
[4546.92 --> 4552.34]  pre-order games a long time ago yep i used to yeah and it was fine and i actually never had a problem
[4552.34 --> 4558.16]  with it yep i i got burned on bioshock too and then i was done yeah and actually i got semi-burned
[4558.16 --> 4561.44]  on left for dead too i thought left for dead too was a complete waste of money for what they were
[4561.44 --> 4569.72]  charging for it uh that should have been an expansion pack for 1999 um okay yeah okay well
[4569.72 --> 4576.08]  we can do this really really quickly liber liber land is the new european nation that runs off bitcoin
[4576.08 --> 4580.80]  so they've got some pretty unorthodox practices taxes all cryptocurrencies all cryptocurrencies
[4580.80 --> 4587.88]  primarily bitcoin uh so it's a small piece of land between croatia and serbia um it's the has no
[4587.88 --> 4593.86]  military taxes are optional um they should have a military they just have like one dude with a
[4593.86 --> 4599.68]  border with a nail through it and be like yeah that's our military yep so they won't let in people
[4599.68 --> 4604.82]  who have communist nazi or extremist past you can't be punished for past criminal offenses
[4604.82 --> 4609.66]  you have to have respect for other people and respect the opinions of others regardless of their
[4609.66 --> 4615.10]  race ethnicity orientation or religion and have respect for private ownership that is untouchable
[4615.10 --> 4620.60]  so registrations and applications for the new country are going swimmingly as over 20 000 people
[4620.60 --> 4625.76]  have already applied with over 100 000 expected by the week's end i actually didn't know it was that
[4625.76 --> 4630.28]  simple to just start a nation we should start linus land i don't think it's that i'd want it to be
[4630.28 --> 4635.00]  more of a theme park though because you have to have the land let's just buy a theme park okay linus
[4635.00 --> 4641.28]  land and it can be the theme park nation theme park nation i'm clearly not talking about anything real
[4641.28 --> 4650.70]  at this point so let's go ahead and uh let's do a little bit of video card news yeah so gtx 980 metal
[4650.70 --> 4662.54]  and 980 ti let's go ahead and pull up the kit guru article here so the 980 ti is rumored to be coming
[4662.54 --> 4670.18]  next month with a 980 metal in the works so the rumored specs of the 980 ti would put it pretty darn
[4670.18 --> 4680.42]  close to the titan x so it would have a fully featured gm 200 processor um it would have six gigs of memory
[4680.42 --> 4689.14]  compared to 12 gigs on the titan x and be basically pretty darn badass with 3072 stream processors etc etc
[4689.14 --> 4693.80]  actually i don't know if that's the full number of texture units because i can't remember the titan x
[4693.80 --> 4698.98]  specs off the top of my head but the point is it'll be super fast it'll be cheaper than a titan x
[4698.98 --> 4708.20]  and uh not buy a whole heck of a lot i guess that's pretty much all there is to say about it yeah i i mean
[4708.20 --> 4713.76]  nvidia is pretty good these days at not making you know people who bought the high-end thing feel too
[4713.76 --> 4717.54]  bad about it i think people who bought titans really got a lot of mileage out of that card even though
[4717.54 --> 4727.54]  they paid a thousand dollars for it um the 980 metal enhanced version it's unknown exactly what that
[4727.54 --> 4733.76]  is um kit guru speculates that it's highly unlikely it'll be based on a cut down version of the gm200 gpu
[4733.76 --> 4741.40]  um i would i would hard to say we don't really know much about highly likely oh highly likely oh
[4741.40 --> 4747.92]  right yeah i was just gonna say that i don't agree with that at all because both titan x and 980 ti
[4747.92 --> 4754.10]  rumors would indicate a fully featured chip so if any of these are have defective units on them they
[4754.10 --> 4760.56]  got to do something with them yeah okay so 980 metal might might be it uh no idea what performance or
[4760.56 --> 4765.24]  time frame will be and nvidia of course didn't comment they generally don't really do that
[4765.24 --> 4775.12]  uh another article from kit guru is that 390x availability might be limited thanks to low yields
[4775.12 --> 4782.98]  of hbm memory so that's that new extremely high performance memory that is going to be the 390x's
[4782.98 --> 4788.28]  sort of feature presentation in terms of what it's doing that hasn't been done before
[4788.28 --> 4793.76]  so i guess that's that's about it pretty much all there is to really say about that it's basically
[4793.76 --> 4799.84]  a rapid fire topic yeah um i mean there's a whole bunch of other stuff in here about hbm memory so
[4799.84 --> 4807.52]  stacks 4d ram dies with 228 bit channels blah blah blah etc etc it results in a memory device with a
[4807.52 --> 4815.16]  1024 bit interface so yeah it's like super crazy fast but supply may be constrained so a fairly
[4815.16 --> 4819.48]  interesting thing that i want to talk about hammering on steam again a little bit oh really
[4819.48 --> 4824.48]  what they do depends on what you think about this uh i'm not a huge fan but i'll talk about why in a
[4824.48 --> 4830.34]  moment anyway steam users now have to spend five dollars um in purchases before they can add friends
[4830.34 --> 4833.94]  so i don't even think that means just adding five dollars to your account i think you actually
[4833.94 --> 4840.30]  actually buy five dollars worth of things um you cannot send friend invites open a group chat vote on
[4840.30 --> 4848.62]  reviews on green light or participate in the steam market etc so you can't like sell csgo skins if
[4848.62 --> 4855.62]  you've been gifted csgo because then you wouldn't have spent money okay um i've had that problem before
[4855.62 --> 4861.36]  i've made a new account gifted at something and then been unable to do certain things i think you
[4861.36 --> 4868.12]  already couldn't participate on the market i'm not entirely sure right um dominic is saying something
[4868.12 --> 4871.64]  apparently you can just put five dollars in your wallet but it does say specifically purchases
[4871.64 --> 4881.98]  so i i like this personally um i mean i was talking to did you know that over um which one is it
[4881.98 --> 4889.12]  overclock.net is no no crap which one is it extreme systems sorry extreme systems is a paid forum now
[4889.12 --> 4896.98]  haven't they been for yeah years yeah okay yeah yeah yeah so it's i think it's like a dollar to
[4896.98 --> 4903.26]  join forever it's a dollar to join forever and their comment um their comments about it i actually
[4903.26 --> 4910.02]  i i realized when i went there not signed in and i was like what the crap this is a paid site now
[4910.02 --> 4915.06]  and then i logged into my old account found out that it was fine because it had been created and
[4915.06 --> 4921.16]  not banned during the the prepaid days um and so i messaged one of the one of the old mods that i
[4921.16 --> 4925.08]  that i kind of used to know over there and i was like what what the crap's going on he's like oh
[4925.08 --> 4932.00]  um it's the best spam prevention of course we could have possibly implemented it cost people practically
[4932.00 --> 4936.66]  nothing but it validates that they're a real person it validates that they actually people who
[4936.66 --> 4942.32]  have invested something into a platform are much less likely to dink around with it and you know
[4942.32 --> 4948.02]  spam people i mean this is a big problem i've always talked about like when eso was coming out
[4948.02 --> 4954.40]  and i hadn't realized that it was a giant pile of junk yet um i kept on saying on the stream that i
[4954.40 --> 4960.38]  hoped it was a paid game i wanted there to be like a subscription or at least a fee to buy the game or
[4960.38 --> 4964.16]  something like that and then once i realized it was going to be junk i said that it was going to go
[4964.16 --> 4971.90]  to free play and it did um but anyways that's regardless free games get the toxic community
[4971.90 --> 4977.00]  all the time because you can just be like uh whatever i don't know if i'm going to come back
[4977.00 --> 4981.10]  to this game time to just flame everyone as hard as i can until i get banned because if i decide to
[4981.10 --> 4985.90]  come back i'll just get a new free account right who cares i might lose my character or whatever but
[4985.90 --> 4990.46]  i can also just trade all my stuff to my buddy then get banned and then if i want to come back he can
[4990.46 --> 4996.06]  just give me some amount of value back or everything back or whatever um what i'm not a huge fan of on
[4996.06 --> 5003.44]  this is someone who could have not much access to any money or say their parents don't want them to
[5003.44 --> 5007.80]  make online purchases at all and all they want to do is do something like play tf2 online with their
[5007.80 --> 5009.06]  friends will be unable to
[5009.06 --> 5020.04]  which is kind of poop um you could i guess like if you hook up through skype or whatever voice chat
[5020.04 --> 5025.70]  application you could like tell people ips bounce back and forth that way and then just make sure all
[5025.70 --> 5029.40]  your communication is completely outside of the game but it's kind of annoying that you wouldn't
[5029.40 --> 5032.40]  be able to communicate through the steam platform so it's not completely stopping them because you
[5032.40 --> 5039.68]  could still join servers through that but there's a fair amount of games um i think csgo if you want
[5039.68 --> 5046.72]  to do matchmaking i i know you can join servers on csgo but i think if you want to do like the matchmaking
[5046.72 --> 5052.88]  side of things um you have to have access to the friend system right so like if your buddy wants to
[5052.88 --> 5058.76]  buy you csgo and sends it to your account then you'd only be able to really play like i think
[5058.76 --> 5061.96]  you could do matchmaking but i don't think you could do matchmaking lobbies with your friends
[5061.96 --> 5065.78]  because i don't know how you could invite someone to it there might be some way around that twitch
[5065.78 --> 5071.38]  chat is probably correcting me right now but it's just kind of annoying i don't know i've got lance b
[5071.38 --> 5075.90]  taylor saying on twitch chat twitch should be paid to get rid of the idiots well a lot of streamers do
[5075.90 --> 5080.62]  that they have their yeah subscriber chat subscriber only chat a lot of people have asked why we
[5080.62 --> 5084.88]  don't have subscribers on this show it's because we only stream once a week so i don't think it's
[5084.88 --> 5090.24]  a great value we think people who are giving us a recurring monthly contribution should be doing it
[5090.24 --> 5094.14]  because of the content in general not just because of our twitch streaming so they should just be
[5094.14 --> 5100.28]  contributing through the website yeah um just as a quick way to address that so uh next article is on
[5100.28 --> 5106.12]  ars technica i've got the link this time but it boop boop and i fix it has completed their
[5106.12 --> 5111.68]  teardown of the apple watch which is rumored and this is pure speculation i don't know why this
[5111.68 --> 5118.54]  news article is getting uh spread so so rapidly rumored to have sold uh i think it was how many
[5118.54 --> 5125.56]  uh did it no up further uh three uh three million units and that would be two billion dollars of
[5125.56 --> 5133.54]  revenue and or something anyway it's a it's an estimate um so think big analytics though estimates
[5133.54 --> 5137.58]  that gross margins on the apple watch are in excess of 60 percent making it extraordinarily
[5137.58 --> 5144.54]  profitable i fix it says replacing the apple watch's battery is easy replacing the processor is
[5144.54 --> 5150.12]  hard something to do with resin and whatnot replacing the screen is apparently fairly easy and they gave
[5150.12 --> 5157.14]  it a repairability score of five out of ten not too bad not too bad for a watch yeah not as good as the
[5157.14 --> 5162.52]  iphone 6 but pretty darn good considering the compactness of the device with that said i don't know if
[5162.52 --> 5168.88]  they've taken apart the edition edition for example though um sony has announced the edition edition was
[5168.88 --> 5174.84]  just gold and no other changes yeah i think you're right okay yeah i'm not i'm not i'm not sure if they
[5174.84 --> 5178.98]  would have made any if that would change anything about the construction though right yeah uh i mean
[5178.98 --> 5184.68]  different metals can make a difference yeah sony announces the xperia z4 their flagship for 2015
[5184.68 --> 5195.16]  basically they changed not a whole heck of a lot um snapdragon 810 32 gig storage every single phone is the
[5195.16 --> 5203.42]  same micro sd 3 gigs of ram 29 30 milliamp hour battery 20.7 megapixel rear camera and it is dust and
[5203.42 --> 5204.04]  waterproof
[5204.04 --> 5214.24]  seriously every single phone is the same all of the phone announcements today were 810s except for one and it was
[5214.24 --> 5214.96]  low-end one
[5214.96 --> 5223.20]  anyways oh well is that it are we good uh amd revealed that windows 10 will launch in late july
[5223.20 --> 5230.78]  i've actually i was kind of trying to wait till windows 10 to move everyone's workstations um and
[5230.78 --> 5237.72]  sort of re re osify everything around here but i actually yeah we picked up a couple of uh windows 8
[5237.72 --> 5243.72]  licenses today actually for a couple of the new servers yes i know it's not a server os i don't care
[5243.72 --> 5249.98]  it doesn't actually matter for most of the things we're doing if we decide to virtualize the 36 core
[5249.98 --> 5255.70]  machine and we have which we probably will which we i don't want to say probably i will say we may do
[5255.70 --> 5263.58]  um it depends it depends if i know but it's not gonna be able to yeah if media encoder handles it okay
[5263.58 --> 5268.40]  then we'll just have it be a single machine i agree i just seriously doubt that it will if it doesn't
[5268.40 --> 5272.18]  then what we may end up actually doing that would that might actually be kind of smart if we did
[5272.18 --> 5277.58]  eight virtual machines each with 32 gigs of ram so we'd have to double the ram and then we gave
[5277.58 --> 5284.10]  every editor their own render box and it was all running off of the one box that has benefits and
[5284.10 --> 5289.66]  downsides yeah it does conversation to have anyway because you wouldn't be able to just like pound out
[5289.66 --> 5296.22]  videos yeah well it would still be really quick but not as fast yeah um but but they wouldn't use
[5296.22 --> 5302.10]  each other's resources and you could have parallelized rendering yeah amd reveals windows 10 will launch in
