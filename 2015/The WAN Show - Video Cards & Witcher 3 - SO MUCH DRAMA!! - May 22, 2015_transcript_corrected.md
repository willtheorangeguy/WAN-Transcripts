[0.00 → 10.72] Okay, so we're live maybe and we super-duper hope that we're back.
[13.14 → 17.02] And I'm seeing load video so we're definitely getting an ad on Twitch.
[17.16 → 22.08] They've got that aspect of the whole experience working, which is great.
[22.16 → 23.34] When was the last time you had Pringles?
[24.24 → 28.24] You know, I do eat like a Pringles or two every once in a while.
[28.24 → 28.72] Oh really?
[28.72 → 31.64] I particularly love Pizza Pringles.
[32.04 → 33.56] Oh, Pizza Pringles are the best.
[33.58 → 33.96] I know.
[34.04 → 38.90] Well, they didn't have them, at least not in Canada, for a really long time.
[39.04 → 41.12] So they brought them back, and I binged a bit.
[41.38 → 46.38] And then it was a terrible, terrible thing for everyone involved.
[47.04 → 54.60] So I guess since we apparently didn't actually have a working stream for quite some time last time around,
[54.60 → 59.60] we're going to go ahead, and we'll intro our topics, and we'll just kind of, yeah, it's definitely working now.
[59.64 → 60.02] There you go.
[60.10 → 60.92] I don't know what it was.
[60.98 → 62.96] We tried turning it off and turning it back on again in networks.
[63.16 → 65.44] We were uploading fine and encoding fine.
[66.26 → 66.66] Yeah.
[66.66 → 69.64] So we've got some great topics for you guys today.
[69.76 → 75.66] CD Project Red is, well, basically they've tackled the whole downgrade issue head on.
[76.30 → 76.80] The tackling.
[77.32 → 79.82] We haven't actually seen any of that happen yet.
[79.86 → 80.82] We haven't seen the tackle.
[81.30 → 84.10] They like dove, and they're right here.
[84.10 → 89.30] I wouldn't even say they've gotten that far because they've got X's and O's drawn on the whiteboard.
[90.02 → 92.04] There is a plan to tackle.
[92.48 → 94.24] Well, they've been developing.
[94.94 → 95.26] Yeah.
[95.94 → 96.70] But still planning.
[96.92 → 98.40] Maybe they're in the huddle at this point.
[98.54 → 98.76] Okay.
[98.92 → 102.68] Or like they're lined up on, maybe they're lined up on the line of scrimmage.
[102.86 → 103.14] All right.
[103.24 → 104.24] Maybe they've gotten that far.
[104.58 → 105.06] Okay.
[105.24 → 110.32] AMD is super, super mad about NVIDIA Game works again.
[110.92 → 111.30] What else we got?
[111.30 → 113.12] Because there's a new NVIDIA Games Works game.
[113.12 → 113.58] Yeah.
[113.58 → 114.08] It makes sense.
[114.50 → 120.10] Also, there's apparently a four gigabyte limit for the first HBM graphics card from AMD,
[120.62 → 121.76] which they're talking a lot about.
[122.04 → 125.50] And LG is unveiling a wallpaper OLED display.
[125.68 → 128.10] Don't tell them anything else about it because there's really not much more.
[128.64 → 129.66] Which is something.
[131.22 → 132.68] Stay tuned to find out.
[134.02 → 134.22] Oh.
[134.78 → 135.26] Wait.
[135.50 → 136.02] It's gone.
[136.12 → 136.58] Where is it?
[137.24 → 137.58] Where is it?
[139.58 → 140.28] The audio.
[140.40 → 140.56] Audio.
[140.94 → 141.48] There's audio?
[141.48 → 141.88] Way too long.
[141.88 → 142.02] Oh.
[142.20 → 142.34] Oh.
[142.54 → 143.18] Sorry, everyone.
[143.18 → 144.12] Sorry, everyone.
[144.24 → 144.90] I'm working on it.
[144.98 → 145.42] There we go.
[145.58 → 145.92] Sorry.
[146.08 → 146.48] Sorry.
[146.76 → 147.20] Sorry.
[148.00 → 148.44] Sorry.
[148.68 → 149.16] Sorry.
[149.28 → 149.60] Sorry.
[150.28 → 151.16] We love you guys.
[151.28 → 152.14] Sorry to your ears.
[152.14 → 156.12] Maybe at some point.
[156.12 → 158.62] What we should do is...
[158.62 → 159.14] Oh, whoops.
[159.34 → 160.28] I forgot to put...
[160.28 → 160.74] Squarespace!
[160.74 → 161.38] Squarespace!
[162.38 → 162.82] Fresh books!
[162.82 → 163.38] Fresh books!
[164.38 → 165.82] I fix it!
[166.34 → 167.30] I fix it.
[168.14 → 168.98] You're not going to sing it?
[170.36 → 171.10] I fix it!
[171.10 → 172.78] Wow.
[172.78 → 173.62] That's awful.
[173.62 → 174.74] That's basically what you did.
[174.82 → 175.70] It's probably just as well.
[175.76 → 177.06] It's probably just as well you did.
[177.06 → 178.12] We were just playing horse.
[178.74 → 179.50] Playing horse.
[179.70 → 181.26] We're wearing almost the same shirt.
[181.82 → 182.62] Yes, we are.
[182.76 → 184.82] We were also wearing almost the same shirt earlier.
[184.94 → 185.48] That's true.
[185.56 → 187.12] We were wearing inverted shirts earlier.
[187.24 → 188.38] He had the...
[188.38 → 189.52] The gray Twitch shirt.
[189.54 → 193.76] The gray Twitch shirt with the purple logo, and I was rocking the purple Twitch shirt with
[193.76 → 194.64] the...
[194.64 → 196.58] Used to be white, but I own it.
[196.58 → 199.44] So now it's gray logo on it.
[200.24 → 200.76] Alright.
[201.16 → 207.60] So CD Project Red is taking the Witcher 3 downgrade issues head on.
[207.70 → 211.34] This was posted by that guy who twirls his pen on the forum.
[211.48 → 213.16] That is a fantastic username.
[213.34 → 217.50] And the original article here is from Eurogamer.net.
[217.58 → 220.02] So let's go ahead and pull that bad boy up.
[220.50 → 222.60] And pretty much the quote here...
[222.60 → 223.50] This is great.
[223.60 → 224.42] The sub-headline is,
[224.42 → 226.44] We don't feel good about it.
[226.58 → 230.00] They...
[230.00 → 230.58] They've...
[230.58 → 237.26] One thing they've done well throughout all of this is they've actually maintained a lot
[237.26 → 241.62] more openness and a lot more honest dialogue with the community.
[241.62 → 242.76] Instead of just saying,
[243.24 → 244.58] No, that never happened.
[245.32 → 246.72] They've come out, and they've said,
[246.76 → 247.34] Well, look.
[247.58 → 250.96] Yeah, we could have made The Witcher 3 a PC exclusive title.
[251.58 → 254.20] Yes, it would have had better graphics.
[254.20 → 258.20] Would we have had the financial ability,
[259.28 → 260.26] were that the case,
[260.30 → 262.44] to make it such a large and immersive game?
[262.76 → 264.06] No, we would not have.
[264.56 → 266.70] So we developed it on multiple platforms.
[266.94 → 269.44] From the sound of what people think about the game so far,
[269.52 → 270.62] that was probably worth it.
[271.08 → 271.42] Yeah.
[271.42 → 272.78] So the thing is,
[272.84 → 275.72] is that the game is getting rave reviews everywhere.
[275.96 → 279.74] People are sinking hours and hours upon hours of time into it already.
[280.34 → 287.22] So it's just unfortunate that the launch had to be sullied by this graphical downgrade issue.
[287.30 → 291.04] The good news is CD Project Red has an action plan.
[291.04 → 295.72] They've drawn it out on the strategy whiteboard in a boardroom somewhere,
[295.88 → 297.32] presumably at their headquarters.
[297.72 → 297.94] Maybe.
[298.16 → 300.58] Or maybe it's a boardroom somewhere else.
[300.92 → 303.22] Technically, everything that he said is possible.
[303.72 → 304.06] Yes.
[304.92 → 307.32] So pretty much there's a patch with updates coming.
[307.54 → 310.20] And these are looking pretty impressive.
[310.20 → 315.40] Not only will they give us more options to tweak in the graphical options' menu,
[315.60 → 319.30] they will also be allowing users to push graphical settings
[319.30 → 322.90] and tweak them even further by modifying INI files,
[323.00 → 324.40] which shouldn't be a feature.
[324.60 → 326.04] In a less Jacky kind of way.
[326.06 → 329.96] Because, like, Quake 3 supports widescreen
[329.96 → 335.10] because you just change your FOV and your resolution in the INI file.
[335.26 → 336.18] It's a pretty old game now.
[336.76 → 338.58] It should not be a feature.
[338.58 → 341.88] But the good news is that at least we're getting it.
[342.14 → 342.28] Yes.
[342.32 → 343.76] So what's the timeline on that?
[344.26 → 347.64] I think it's next week.
[347.80 → 348.08] Okay.
[348.38 → 348.84] Sometime?
[348.98 → 349.42] 27.
[349.56 → 351.06] Yeah, sometime around next week, I think.
[351.50 → 351.72] Yeah.
[351.88 → 352.44] So it's...
[352.44 → 352.76] Oh, yeah.
[352.78 → 353.66] It's waiting in certification,
[353.66 → 357.74] so it should actually be dropping on Tuesday of next week.
[357.82 → 359.54] Now, this is kind of nice.
[359.78 → 360.58] Although...
[360.58 → 363.94] So, quoted...
[363.94 → 365.88] Quote from CD Project Red,
[365.88 → 368.66] For those who are still not 100% decided,
[369.08 → 371.04] I definitely encourage them to wait
[371.04 → 374.66] and see what we will be releasing in patches, updates, and whatnot.
[374.84 → 378.46] So it's very high road of CD Project Red to say,
[378.58 → 380.50] Hey, you know, if you're not sure about it,
[380.72 → 383.84] we really want you guys to be sure about the game before you purchase.
[384.30 → 386.12] I mean, did you guys accept pre-orders?
[387.16 → 388.74] Did you show off in-game footage
[388.74 → 392.02] that didn't actually end up being in the shipping product?
[392.02 → 393.86] And did you take pre-orders on that?
[393.96 → 394.78] Like, did you do that?
[394.96 → 397.18] If we hadn't caught you on this, would you have...
[397.18 → 398.90] Did you really think no one was going to catch it?
[399.34 → 400.48] That's the big question.
[401.04 → 401.66] I...
[401.66 → 405.82] If it's only taking them a couple of weeks to fix this stuff,
[406.26 → 407.92] why wasn't it fixed already?
[408.32 → 408.54] Yeah.
[408.92 → 410.44] Because surely they knew,
[410.60 → 412.62] after the Watch Dogs debacle,
[413.32 → 417.52] that someone was going to look at gameplay footage
[417.52 → 419.36] from a gaming event from before
[419.36 → 421.68] and compare and see that they're not the same.
[421.68 → 423.94] Surely they figured that would happen.
[424.00 → 425.26] You know what is pretty funny, though,
[425.34 → 428.60] is the amount of, like, PCMR threads on Reddit and stuff
[428.60 → 429.88] of people...
[429.88 → 432.16] I think I only saw two of them.
[432.24 → 433.76] Maybe there was some more.
[433.84 → 435.52] But people looking at the IGN footage
[435.52 → 436.76] where they actually did a comparison
[436.76 → 438.48] and being like,
[438.56 → 440.02] Oh, I think they might have screwed up.
[440.08 → 442.14] And, like, they labelled it improperly.
[442.20 → 443.16] And they totally didn't.
[443.38 → 444.60] And the PC one looks way better.
[444.92 → 446.90] And you just don't know what good graphics look like.
[447.42 → 448.12] It's kind of funny
[448.12 → 451.06] because it doesn't seem that complicated, does it?
[451.06 → 451.20] No.
[451.68 → 453.66] Anyway, so speaking of good graphics,
[453.76 → 454.32] some of the things...
[454.32 → 455.34] We actually never mentioned this.
[455.36 → 457.02] Some of the things that you'll be able to tweak
[457.02 → 458.08] with the upcoming patch
[458.08 → 460.40] are things like grass and vegetation density.
[460.58 → 463.26] So if you just have more GPU horsepower
[463.26 → 464.30] to throw at it,
[464.38 → 465.94] then go hard, more grass.
[465.94 → 466.70] That looks perfect.
[466.74 → 468.12] Looking at a lot of the Skyrim mods
[468.12 → 469.38] that just add grass,
[469.44 → 470.20] and that's all they do,
[470.26 → 471.38] it makes it look perfect.
[471.40 → 472.80] Grass makes every experience better.
[473.16 → 475.10] And you can add post-processing effects
[475.10 → 475.88] like sharpening,
[475.94 → 477.26] and you can increase draw distances.
[477.42 → 477.84] For me,
[478.24 → 480.80] draw distances are a huge one.
[480.80 → 483.54] Draw distances are the difference
[483.54 → 488.10] between circa 2008 World of Warcraft
[488.10 → 490.32] and a game that looks modern.
[490.88 → 492.26] Being able to amp that up,
[492.28 → 493.72] you can have the cartoonist,
[493.84 → 495.40] the stupidest graphics in the world,
[495.40 → 497.12] and great draw distances
[497.12 → 499.16] make the world feel bigger.
[499.26 → 501.00] And I'm not talking draw distance like
[501.00 → 503.44] there's kind of this triangle in the distance,
[503.66 → 505.74] and there's kind of like a jagged line
[505.74 → 506.88] on the top of it that's white.
[506.88 → 507.78] That's not a mountain.
[507.78 → 509.38] I'm talking draw distances
[509.38 → 512.00] that scale in a way that feels natural.
[512.16 → 513.30] So things like trees,
[513.48 → 515.48] not just as you come over a hill,
[515.82 → 518.10] and like the entire forest pops in
[518.10 → 519.30] as you take three steps forward.
[519.58 → 520.92] That's hideous.
[521.02 → 522.44] That takes me right out of the game.
[522.76 → 524.52] Whereas being able to increase that
[524.52 → 526.28] if you have the horses for it
[526.28 → 527.58] means more to me
[527.58 → 529.14] than some tessellation here
[529.14 → 530.60] or a more detailed shadow there.
[530.70 → 532.58] I would love that to be an option in a game
[532.58 → 534.26] for all the things that are like
[534.26 → 535.58] pretty far away in draw distance
[535.58 → 537.40] to just be drawn like a little kid did it.
[537.90 → 539.16] So like the trees are like,
[539.28 → 539.60] yeah,
[539.82 → 541.24] with like some random triangles
[541.24 → 541.98] coming off the side,
[542.06 → 542.90] and a mountain is just
[542.90 → 544.50] literally a triangle with a squiggly.
[544.62 → 545.06] You know what?
[545.08 → 546.44] If someone could find a way
[546.44 → 548.34] to do that artfully,
[549.54 → 552.00] that could actually be really cool.
[552.60 → 552.76] Yeah.
[552.80 → 554.66] Like as the object gets closer,
[554.78 → 557.16] it looks as if an older and older kid drew it.
[557.32 → 557.96] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[558.08 → 559.96] So like you could even go from,
[560.66 → 561.16] uh,
[561.48 → 561.80] yeah,
[561.90 → 562.24] I don't know.
[562.24 → 562.94] That's kind of interesting.
[563.06 → 565.98] Just upgrade based on tiers of quality.
[566.16 → 566.64] Like you said,
[566.68 → 567.76] older and older kid did it.
[568.10 → 569.32] So like from really far away,
[569.40 → 570.26] it's super Derby,
[570.36 → 571.28] but you can barely see it.
[571.32 → 572.42] And as you get closer and closer
[572.42 → 573.44] and closer and closer and closer,
[573.54 → 574.20] it keeps on getting better.
[574.26 → 574.36] Well,
[574.40 → 575.74] what the dev would have to do
[575.74 → 580.46] is quantitatively figure out
[580.46 → 581.54] like the
[582.02 → 582.68] the
[582.68 → 582.78] the
[582.78 → 583.00] the
[583.00 → 584.26] because not every tree
[584.26 → 585.18] could be the same tree.
[585.40 → 587.12] You can just have some two-year-old
[587.12 → 587.96] come in and draw a tree
[587.96 → 589.24] and then that's like your tree
[589.24 → 589.86] from X distance
[589.86 → 590.82] because then you're going to have that.
[590.82 → 591.28] It's,
[591.36 → 592.68] there's not going to be anything,
[592.68 → 593.24] um,
[593.56 → 594.50] smooth about it
[594.50 → 595.40] as you move towards it.
[595.50 → 596.48] It'll just be pop,
[596.58 → 596.78] pop,
[596.88 → 597.10] pop,
[597.18 → 598.60] different objects
[598.60 → 599.54] that will look horrible.
[599.88 → 602.02] Whereas if they could quantify
[602.02 → 604.90] the drawing accuracy
[604.90 → 605.48] and,
[605.54 → 606.88] and seamlessly meld
[606.88 → 608.88] from one level to another
[608.88 → 609.82] as you get closer to it.
[609.84 → 610.80] You'd probably have to go backwards.
[611.12 → 611.86] You'd probably have to draw
[611.86 → 612.98] the really nice one first
[612.98 → 614.22] and then kind of break it down.
[614.26 → 615.80] It would probably make your eyes bleed
[615.80 → 616.28] regardless,
[616.54 → 618.30] but it seems like a cool idea.
[618.32 → 618.86] I would like to see it
[618.86 → 619.70] and I don't know why.
[619.70 → 619.94] Yeah,
[619.96 → 620.76] I'd like to see it
[620.76 → 621.32] and then go,
[621.48 → 622.14] that's cool.
[622.20 → 622.84] That was cool.
[623.12 → 624.16] Thanks for all that work.
[624.28 → 624.86] Good for you.
[624.96 → 626.04] Let's not use it now.
[626.22 → 626.48] Yeah.
[627.18 → 627.84] Oh man.
[628.04 → 628.46] All right.
[628.56 → 628.98] So,
[629.48 → 630.74] more Witcher discussion
[630.74 → 632.08] this time posted by
[632.08 → 632.68] Cameron,
[632.88 → 633.34] Cameron,
[633.34 → 633.94] Cameron,
[634.34 → 635.08] sorry about that,
[635.14 → 635.46] Cameron.
[635.46 → 635.80] Um,
[636.58 → 637.82] AMD says,
[637.82 → 639.92] and this is going to be a lot
[639.92 → 640.90] of AMD says,
[641.00 → 641.86] Nvidia says,
[641.94 → 642.44] because,
[642.98 → 643.54] um,
[644.02 → 646.54] we haven't signed
[646.54 → 647.50] an NDA
[647.50 → 649.30] to see the source code
[649.30 → 651.10] for Nvidia Game works features.
[651.50 → 651.98] So,
[652.04 → 652.92] we don't know
[652.92 → 654.10] what's on the NDA
[654.10 → 656.02] to see the source code
[656.02 → 657.12] for Nvidia Game works.
[657.22 → 657.40] Now,
[657.82 → 658.90] the good news
[658.90 → 660.66] is that the source code
[660.66 → 661.80] is available,
[661.80 → 663.04] um,
[663.10 → 664.12] to game developers
[664.12 → 665.34] who are implementing features
[665.34 → 666.72] such as Hair works,
[666.78 → 668.50] which makes hair more realistic
[668.50 → 670.04] with tessellated strands.
[670.28 → 671.48] But the bad news
[671.48 → 672.02] is that,
[672.16 → 673.34] and this is what AMD is saying,
[673.96 → 675.64] they cannot get access
[675.64 → 676.64] to the source code
[676.64 → 677.42] and are saying,
[677.82 → 678.32] therefore,
[678.50 → 679.78] they cannot optimize
[679.78 → 680.74] their driver
[680.74 → 682.96] for these particular features.
[683.08 → 683.68] Something that
[683.68 → 685.92] particularly makes them upset
[685.92 → 688.16] because AMD developed features
[688.16 → 689.20] like Tress FX,
[689.64 → 690.32] featured in games
[690.32 → 691.80] such as Tomb Raider 2013,
[691.80 → 696.48] were possible
[696.48 → 697.28] to optimize
[697.28 → 697.96] quite easily
[697.96 → 699.46] on Nvidia's hardware
[699.46 → 700.24] thanks to,
[700.82 → 701.06] oh,
[701.18 → 701.72] thanks Norton.
[702.20 → 702.76] Oh,
[702.88 → 703.52] thanks Norton.
[703.82 → 704.34] Oh my god.
[704.66 → 705.76] Oh my god.
[706.36 → 707.30] Thanks again Norton.
[707.54 → 708.72] This is why people need
[708.72 → 710.00] Norton removal tool.
[710.18 → 710.34] Yeah,
[710.40 → 710.58] I know,
[710.62 → 710.76] right?
[711.20 → 711.62] Um,
[712.46 → 713.70] so pretty much
[713.70 → 714.66] AMD's come out
[714.66 → 715.16] and said
[715.16 → 716.44] that when Nvidia
[716.44 → 718.44] dropped the Hair works code
[718.44 → 719.10] on the game
[719.10 → 720.44] two months before launch,
[720.44 → 722.80] it completely sabotaged
[722.80 → 725.44] Witcher 3 performance.
[725.66 → 725.82] Now,
[725.92 → 727.04] with that said,
[727.34 → 729.50] you can turn Hair works off.
[729.72 → 729.98] Yep.
[730.02 → 731.58] You do not have to use it.
[731.66 → 731.88] Yep.
[732.08 → 732.40] So,
[732.76 → 733.74] that's an option.
[733.90 → 735.34] And when we do comparative testing
[735.34 → 736.12] in Witcher 3,
[736.48 → 736.78] uh,
[736.78 → 738.26] we are probably going to have to turn
[738.26 → 738.94] Hair works off
[738.94 → 740.08] just because it does
[740.08 → 740.76] completely,
[740.76 → 741.64] uh,
[742.72 → 743.94] widen the gap
[743.94 → 745.14] between an Nvidia card
[745.14 → 745.94] and an AMD card
[745.94 → 746.64] to the point where
[746.64 → 748.06] it seems like,
[748.38 → 748.84] ugh,
[748.98 → 749.08] yeah,
[749.14 → 749.54] that's tough.
[749.54 → 750.22] We're to the point where
[750.22 → 751.36] you can't
[751.36 → 752.68] quantitatively
[752.68 → 754.26] talk about the difference
[754.26 → 754.76] in performance
[754.76 → 755.44] between the cards
[755.44 → 756.28] because it becomes
[756.28 → 756.94] very subjective
[756.94 → 757.46] when you go,
[757.56 → 757.62] well,
[757.64 → 759.56] this one's at 62 FPS
[759.56 → 760.58] and this one's 67
[760.58 → 761.56] but in this one,
[761.86 → 762.12] you know,
[762.22 → 763.60] Gerald's chest hair,
[763.98 → 764.34] uh,
[764.40 → 764.64] you know,
[764.70 → 766.24] curls very convincingly.
[766.24 → 767.16] It looks a lot more manly.
[767.22 → 767.46] Yeah,
[767.58 → 768.94] so it becomes a very
[768.94 → 769.82] difficult discussion
[769.82 → 770.76] whereas we like to talk
[770.76 → 771.30] pure numbers
[771.30 → 772.26] whenever possible.
[772.94 → 773.34] Um,
[773.44 → 774.98] I don't know
[774.98 → 776.50] what else there is to say.
[776.54 → 776.72] I mean,
[776.72 → 777.84] something to understand.
[777.86 → 778.90] It's a lot of the same story.
[778.90 → 779.22] Yeah,
[779.30 → 780.34] something to understand
[780.34 → 780.90] about this,
[780.96 → 781.36] you guys,
[781.70 → 783.52] is that AMD's cards,
[783.96 → 784.56] whether we're talking
[784.56 → 785.20] Witcher 3
[785.20 → 786.20] or whatever else,
[786.28 → 786.66] straight up,
[786.74 → 788.14] do not perform as well
[788.14 → 789.76] with heavy tessellation
[789.76 → 790.74] as Nvidia cards.
[791.30 → 791.62] So,
[791.72 → 793.04] until AMD releases
[793.04 → 793.54] the
[793.70 → 794.02] let's say,
[794.06 → 794.84] a rumoured upcoming
[794.84 → 795.98] 390X,
[796.06 → 796.64] for example,
[797.20 → 797.52] with,
[797.58 → 797.88] you know,
[798.00 → 798.74] amped up,
[798.96 → 799.34] you know,
[800.06 → 800.72] you know,
[800.78 → 803.04] injections of steroids
[803.04 → 804.96] directly into the muscle tissue,
[805.08 → 805.82] not that that would
[805.82 → 806.92] necessarily help.
[807.40 → 807.80] Um,
[808.14 → 809.82] until it's got tessellation,
[809.92 → 810.10] you know,
[810.16 → 811.10] out the Yazoo,
[811.54 → 812.04] uh,
[812.16 → 814.18] it just may not even be possible
[814.18 → 815.20] for AMD to optimize.
[815.38 → 816.22] And one of the things
[816.22 → 817.48] that Nvidia pointed out
[817.48 → 818.66] is that,
[818.66 → 819.82] um,
[820.14 → 820.82] a lot of the time
[820.82 → 821.82] the driver optimizations
[821.82 → 822.62] done by AMD
[822.62 → 823.44] or Nvidia
[823.44 → 824.68] on a game-by-game basis
[824.68 → 826.46] are based on binary builds,
[826.54 → 827.66] not on source code anyway.
[827.80 → 827.92] So,
[827.98 → 829.02] Nvidia's basically going,
[829.50 → 830.36] blah, blah, blah, blah,
[830.36 → 832.08] AMD shouldn't even need a source,
[832.30 → 833.34] need the source code
[833.34 → 834.74] in order to optimize anyhow.
[836.88 → 837.44] So,
[837.72 → 838.90] this is one of those things
[838.90 → 839.16] where,
[839.30 → 839.98] unfortunately,
[840.58 → 841.56] an Nvidia says
[841.56 → 842.52] there's nothing
[842.52 → 843.34] in their agreement
[843.34 → 844.88] with a game developer
[844.88 → 846.02] that prevents AMD
[846.02 → 846.68] from working
[846.68 → 847.58] with the game developer
[847.58 → 848.24] to optimize.
[848.90 → 849.94] Unless we actually
[849.94 → 851.46] had those contracts
[851.46 → 852.34] and could read them,
[852.58 → 853.36] we actually
[853.36 → 855.14] can't say for sure.
[855.72 → 856.04] So,
[856.26 → 857.04] that's pretty much
[857.04 → 857.96] all there is to it.
[858.26 → 858.58] Um,
[858.98 → 860.48] the game performs better
[860.48 → 862.00] with Hair works on,
[862.00 → 863.48] an Nvidia feature
[863.48 → 864.70] on Nvidia cards.
[865.38 → 866.38] Is Nvidia right
[866.38 → 867.90] to develop their features
[867.90 → 870.50] and not really lift a finger
[870.50 → 871.88] to help people
[871.88 → 873.10] who are not their customers
[873.10 → 874.42] enjoy the features better?
[875.18 → 875.56] Um,
[875.98 → 877.46] you could probably say
[877.46 → 877.78] yes,
[877.86 → 878.34] they are.
[879.04 → 879.56] But,
[879.76 → 880.56] should they be
[880.56 → 881.36] specifically
[881.36 → 883.12] sabotaging the performance
[883.12 → 884.40] on a competitor's cards?
[884.86 → 885.12] Then,
[885.22 → 886.22] definitely not.
[886.32 → 886.84] Unfortunately,
[887.18 → 887.94] we just have
[887.94 → 888.82] no way of knowing
[888.82 → 889.64] unless we actually
[889.64 → 892.06] sat in the meeting room,
[892.42 → 893.04] we have no way
[893.04 → 893.56] of knowing
[893.56 → 895.80] if Nvidia really has
[895.80 → 897.16] that tightest triangle
[897.16 → 898.50] hold on these game developers
[898.50 → 900.00] that they can convince them
[900.00 → 900.92] to sabotage
[900.92 → 901.90] their game's performance
[901.90 → 904.18] on 25 to 30%
[904.18 → 905.92] of the discrete graphics cards
[905.92 → 906.32] out there.
[906.44 → 906.74] Which,
[906.82 → 907.70] when I put it like that,
[907.76 → 908.92] sounds pretty far-fetched,
[908.94 → 909.34] doesn't it?
[909.76 → 910.36] Can you imagine
[910.36 → 911.02] a game developer
[911.02 → 911.96] that's so concerned
[911.96 → 913.06] about selling enough units
[913.06 → 914.32] that they develop
[914.32 → 915.52] for multiple platforms
[915.52 → 918.00] just saying goodbye
[918.00 → 918.76] to performance
[918.76 → 920.40] and annoying the customers
[920.40 → 921.68] for a third
[921.68 → 922.62] of the PC gamers?
[924.32 → 925.04] I don't know.
[925.68 → 926.50] It's possible,
[926.72 → 926.92] but yeah.
[926.92 → 927.82] Anything's possible.
[928.40 → 929.18] Speaking of anything,
[929.26 → 929.62] it's possible.
[929.62 → 930.82] we are going to do
[930.82 → 932.06] a Witcher 3 performance thing,
[932.32 → 933.98] like he slightly mentioned,
[934.12 → 935.32] but I think at this point
[935.32 → 936.08] it'll probably be
[936.08 → 936.92] after Computer.
[937.24 → 937.44] Oh,
[937.54 → 937.76] okay.
[938.30 → 938.52] Yeah.
[939.00 → 940.56] I have reasons for that.
[941.80 → 942.60] Fair enough.
[942.72 → 942.90] Yeah.
[942.90 → 943.38] Alright,
[943.64 → 945.34] so this one was posted
[945.34 → 946.28] by Notional
[946.28 → 947.46] and this is looking
[947.46 → 948.90] pretty freaking cool.
[949.00 → 949.90] The original article
[949.90 → 951.18] is from
[951.18 → 955.18] english.yonhapnews.co.kr
[955.18 → 955.56] Oh, yeah.
[955.56 → 956.12] Yo-nap.
[956.52 → 958.70] LG display unveils
[958.70 → 961.44] wallpaper OLED panel.
[962.04 → 964.68] Look at that.
[965.34 → 966.42] The thing on the right.
[967.34 → 968.00] Jeez.
[969.14 → 972.16] So this OLED display,
[972.16 → 973.02] you can see,
[973.14 → 975.70] is being lifted
[975.70 → 976.72] so you can see the thickness.
[976.84 → 978.02] You can see it's not just
[978.02 → 979.12] embedded in the wall
[979.12 → 980.36] like a total cheat.
[980.98 → 981.96] This OLED display
[981.96 → 982.88] is less than
[982.88 → 984.74] one millimetre thick,
[985.30 → 986.10] weighs less than
[986.10 → 987.40] five pounds
[987.40 → 988.54] for a...
[988.54 → 989.32] 1.9 kilograms.
[989.88 → 990.10] Yeah.
[990.22 → 990.76] 1.9.
[990.76 → 991.14] Thank you.
[991.20 → 992.02] That's an exact weight.
[992.36 → 993.14] And what was that?
[993.22 → 994.36] For a 55-inch?
[994.36 → 995.82] 55-inch OLED panel.
[996.08 → 997.84] Less than five pounds.
[998.24 → 998.54] Oh, wait.
[998.58 → 998.70] What?
[998.80 → 999.06] Yes.
[999.06 → 1001.42] And they're saying
[1001.42 → 1002.86] that their sales targets
[1002.86 → 1003.62] for OLED panels
[1003.62 → 1005.12] is 600,000 in 2015
[1005.12 → 1007.16] and almost triple that
[1007.16 → 1009.22] of 1.5 million for 2016
[1009.22 → 1010.20] and that apparently
[1010.20 → 1012.84] LCDs took 10 years
[1012.84 → 1014.12] to reach these kinds
[1014.12 → 1015.52] of manufacturing yields.
[1015.52 → 1016.28] So LG,
[1016.80 → 1017.42] given that they're
[1017.42 → 1018.36] one of the few
[1018.36 → 1019.10] that is investing
[1019.10 → 1020.26] heavily in OLED
[1020.26 → 1022.16] versus just kind of
[1022.16 → 1023.38] continuing to push
[1023.38 → 1024.50] the bar on LCD
[1024.50 → 1025.18] and try and sell
[1025.18 → 1025.72] more LCD,
[1026.12 → 1026.96] this could put LG
[1026.96 → 1029.56] in a fantastic position
[1029.56 → 1030.88] when it comes to
[1030.88 → 1032.66] anything with a display
[1032.66 → 1033.08] on it
[1033.08 → 1033.98] because OLED has
[1033.98 → 1036.04] some compelling advantages
[1036.04 → 1036.84] whether we're talking
[1036.84 → 1037.84] about mobile devices
[1037.84 → 1039.04] where they save power
[1039.04 → 1040.30] and where...
[1040.30 → 1041.12] or rather we're talking
[1041.12 → 1042.70] about really anything else
[1042.70 → 1043.34] with a display
[1043.34 → 1044.42] where they save thickness
[1044.42 → 1045.70] and they increase
[1045.70 → 1046.86] contrast ratio.
[1047.36 → 1047.94] All of those things
[1047.94 → 1048.30] are good.
[1048.64 → 1049.04] Apparently,
[1049.18 → 1049.98] they're also planning...
[1049.98 → 1050.26] What was it?
[1050.28 → 1051.62] A 99-inch?
[1054.62 → 1055.06] Yes,
[1055.18 → 1055.98] 99 inches.
[1056.18 → 1057.06] As big as a...
[1057.06 → 1057.50] For this year.
[1057.66 → 1059.02] For this year.
[1059.40 → 1060.96] 99-inch OLED panel.
[1061.10 → 1062.20] And given how much room
[1062.20 → 1062.66] you're saving
[1062.66 → 1063.76] in terms of deploying things,
[1063.98 → 1064.62] what I want to know
[1064.62 → 1065.10] is how you're going
[1065.10 → 1066.08] to plug anything into it.
[1066.08 → 1067.62] I mean,
[1067.64 → 1068.24] I guess you'll just
[1068.24 → 1069.24] have to have...
[1069.24 → 1070.46] You'll just have to have
[1070.46 → 1070.86] like a...
[1070.86 → 1073.30] Like a ribbon cable
[1073.30 → 1074.06] that goes to like
[1074.06 → 1075.36] a control breakout box
[1075.36 → 1075.72] or what?
[1075.74 → 1075.80] Yeah, I was going to say
[1075.80 → 1076.40] a breakout box
[1076.40 → 1076.96] like the MacBook.
[1076.96 → 1077.86] They're going to have
[1077.86 → 1078.64] to have something
[1078.64 → 1079.70] more consumer friendly,
[1079.86 → 1080.34] obviously.
[1080.70 → 1081.60] It doesn't show any cables
[1081.60 → 1083.64] in the thing,
[1083.82 → 1084.70] which means it's probably
[1084.70 → 1085.58] plugged in through the back.
[1085.68 → 1086.68] Yeah, it's probably behind.
[1086.90 → 1087.18] Yeah.
[1087.52 → 1088.66] I mean, remember guys,
[1088.70 → 1089.46] that's the panel,
[1089.58 → 1090.30] so it's still going to need
[1090.30 → 1091.26] some electronics in there.
[1091.32 → 1091.78] It's not like we're going
[1091.78 → 1092.88] to get away from PCBs
[1092.88 → 1093.56] anytime soon.
[1093.56 → 1096.52] But very, very impressive.
[1096.70 → 1097.76] The fact that you'll be able
[1097.76 → 1099.66] to basically...
[1099.66 → 1100.80] Well, I mean, okay.
[1101.46 → 1102.38] Okay, we have a lot
[1102.38 → 1103.50] of thin TVs already,
[1103.76 → 1105.58] but they'll be even thinner.
[1106.00 → 1106.96] One of the challenges,
[1107.12 → 1107.42] apparently,
[1107.48 → 1108.66] I was talking to Corning
[1108.66 → 1110.12] about this at CES
[1110.12 → 1111.40] this last year.
[1111.44 → 1112.18] One of the challenges,
[1112.80 → 1113.64] now that displays
[1113.64 → 1114.60] are getting so thin,
[1114.66 → 1116.60] is not just making them thinner.
[1116.98 → 1117.30] Apparently,
[1117.30 → 1118.54] they can just do that now.
[1118.90 → 1120.04] It's not making them thinner.
[1120.16 → 1121.10] It's actually making them
[1121.10 → 1122.04] strong enough
[1122.04 → 1123.50] to work at all.
[1123.96 → 1124.90] So Corning was saying
[1124.90 → 1126.32] that one of the materials
[1126.32 → 1127.26] that they developed,
[1127.40 → 1128.30] I think this was for,
[1128.40 → 1129.96] I want to say for LCDs.
[1130.14 → 1130.86] Yeah, it must have been
[1130.86 → 1131.36] for LCDs.
[1131.42 → 1131.80] You wouldn't need this
[1131.80 → 1132.08] for OLED.
[1132.60 → 1133.92] Is a glass
[1133.92 → 1134.90] that is able
[1134.90 → 1136.68] to disperse light evenly
[1136.68 → 1137.80] in the same way
[1137.80 → 1139.06] that the plastic layer
[1139.06 → 1140.80] in your existing LCD TV would
[1140.80 → 1141.68] because apparently
[1141.68 → 1142.32] this gives it
[1142.32 → 1143.22] a lot more strength
[1143.22 → 1144.04] and you can save
[1144.04 → 1145.94] an entire reinforcing layer
[1145.94 → 1147.48] that you would have
[1147.48 → 1148.72] otherwise needed.
[1149.20 → 1150.50] Not that for me
[1150.50 → 1151.36] it really makes
[1151.36 → 1152.30] any particular difference.
[1152.30 → 1152.96] I think my TV
[1152.96 → 1153.90] is about this thick
[1153.90 → 1155.30] and I've never thought
[1155.30 → 1155.80] to myself,
[1155.96 → 1156.34] you know,
[1157.14 → 1158.22] if only my TV
[1158.22 → 1159.20] was an inch thinner,
[1159.78 → 1161.42] then that show
[1161.42 → 1162.02] would look better.
[1162.26 → 1162.92] It's still cool
[1162.92 → 1163.74] that that's an option
[1163.74 → 1164.30] because if you went
[1164.30 → 1164.82] to the store
[1164.82 → 1166.10] and it was the same price
[1166.10 → 1166.72] and that much thinner,
[1166.86 → 1167.42] then that's cool.
[1167.42 → 1168.08] It might as well.
[1168.08 → 1170.38] Yeah, but you're right.
[1170.58 → 1171.54] I wouldn't rush
[1171.54 → 1172.08] into the store
[1172.08 → 1173.22] and replace your TV.
[1173.34 → 1173.92] Your TV's fine.
[1174.06 → 1175.04] If your TV is
[1175.04 → 1176.38] like a piece of furniture,
[1176.66 → 1178.34] if it's like a show,
[1178.68 → 1179.64] if your house is all
[1179.64 → 1181.32] modern and amazing,
[1181.64 → 1182.72] mine will never,
[1183.22 → 1183.58] ever be
[1183.58 → 1184.48] because there's no way
[1184.48 → 1184.96] I could spend
[1184.96 → 1185.94] that kind of money
[1185.94 → 1186.76] to replace things
[1186.76 → 1187.56] I already own.
[1188.12 → 1188.82] But if you're
[1188.82 → 1189.88] into that sort of thing,
[1189.94 → 1190.38] then I'm sure
[1190.38 → 1190.88] you'll be into
[1190.88 → 1191.66] this sort of thing.
[1192.00 → 1192.20] Yeah.
[1192.32 → 1193.36] And we could all
[1193.36 → 1194.12] be into things
[1194.12 → 1195.12] and that's cool.
[1195.20 → 1195.68] That's fine.
[1196.52 → 1198.12] Toyota Prius batteries
[1198.12 → 1199.16] apparently being targeted
[1199.16 → 1200.26] by car thieves.
[1200.36 → 1200.80] This was posted
[1200.80 → 1202.42] by Were 165.
[1202.84 → 1203.50] I guess it was
[1203.50 → 1204.28] a matter of time
[1204.28 → 1205.50] because if thieves
[1205.50 → 1207.00] are going to steal
[1207.00 → 1207.94] the copper out of
[1207.94 → 1208.72] power lines
[1208.72 → 1210.98] and risk getting killed.
[1211.34 → 1211.86] That happened
[1211.86 → 1212.80] not way too long ago,
[1212.92 → 1214.28] like relatively close
[1214.28 → 1214.64] to here.
[1215.20 → 1215.58] Did it really?
[1215.76 → 1216.04] Yeah.
[1216.20 → 1217.10] I think they were
[1217.10 → 1217.70] stealing it out of
[1217.70 → 1218.40] like an abandoned
[1218.40 → 1220.12] feeder or something.
[1220.60 → 1221.02] There you go.
[1221.02 → 1221.86] The power hadn't been
[1221.86 → 1222.94] turned off to the theatre.
[1223.22 → 1223.60] Well, there you go.
[1223.60 → 1224.04] So they're ripping
[1224.04 → 1224.90] copper wire out
[1224.90 → 1225.86] and just, yeah.
[1225.94 → 1226.70] And there you go.
[1226.82 → 1227.68] Bad news bears.
[1228.02 → 1228.94] And that's how it happens,
[1229.10 → 1229.62] my friends.
[1229.78 → 1231.56] So 2003 to 2009
[1231.56 → 1232.44] Primuses are just
[1232.44 → 1233.04] kind of starting
[1233.04 → 1233.44] to come up
[1233.44 → 1234.30] on battery replacement
[1234.30 → 1234.74] timings.
[1234.86 → 1235.70] That costs around
[1235.70 → 1238.70] $2,500 US.
[1239.10 → 1239.78] So it's not cheap.
[1240.38 → 1241.86] But you can buy them
[1241.86 → 1242.72] on Craigslist
[1242.72 → 1244.46] for $900 to $1,000.
[1246.86 → 1248.08] Now they don't
[1248.08 → 1249.16] put a serial number
[1249.16 → 1250.36] or a VIN number
[1250.36 → 1251.10] on the batteries.
[1251.38 → 1252.16] So they're pretty
[1252.16 → 1253.16] much untraceable.
[1253.40 → 1255.02] That, and it's being
[1255.02 → 1255.90] said that you can
[1255.90 → 1257.08] walk out with a
[1257.08 → 1258.24] Prius battery in
[1258.24 → 1259.10] about 20 minutes
[1259.10 → 1259.98] if you've got a
[1259.98 → 1260.52] couple people.
[1260.90 → 1261.74] Now, to be clear,
[1261.82 → 1262.96] this is not as much
[1262.96 → 1263.90] of an issue for a
[1263.90 → 1264.94] pure electric vehicle
[1264.94 → 1265.72] like something like
[1265.72 → 1266.68] a Tesla Model S
[1266.68 → 1267.80] because for one,
[1267.96 → 1268.84] it's much harder
[1268.84 → 1269.64] to get at the battery
[1269.64 → 1270.50] and it's in a more
[1270.50 → 1271.44] secure location.
[1271.62 → 1272.02] It's not just
[1272.02 → 1272.78] under the trunk.
[1273.24 → 1274.34] And for number two,
[1274.70 → 1275.78] it's extremely heavy.
[1275.84 → 1276.24] What is it?
[1276.40 → 1277.30] A thousand pounds
[1277.30 → 1278.02] or something stupid
[1278.02 → 1278.38] like that?
[1278.38 → 1278.56] Yeah, no,
[1278.64 → 1279.56] that's really not
[1279.56 → 1279.74] light.
[1279.82 → 1280.44] Tesla Model S
[1280.44 → 1281.64] batteries weigh
[1281.64 → 1282.26] about a thousand
[1282.26 → 1282.52] pounds.
[1282.58 → 1283.12] Weigh about a thousand
[1283.12 → 1283.56] pounds compared
[1283.56 → 1284.44] to a hundred and
[1284.44 → 1285.22] fifty pounds
[1285.22 → 1286.36] for something like
[1286.36 → 1287.34] a hybrid vehicle.
[1287.62 → 1288.22] Good luck having
[1288.22 → 1288.84] you and your buddy
[1288.84 → 1289.18] haul that.
[1289.22 → 1289.78] It's possible
[1289.78 → 1290.28] if you're both
[1290.28 → 1291.76] huge dudes.
[1291.76 → 1292.48] A thousand pounds?
[1292.48 → 1293.28] Big dudes.
[1293.68 → 1294.04] Depending.
[1294.30 → 1295.08] Like, if you had to
[1295.08 → 1296.20] like bend over
[1296.20 → 1296.88] to lift it out
[1296.88 → 1297.30] or something,
[1297.44 → 1298.12] like, come on.
[1298.12 → 1298.62] Could be terrible.
[1298.82 → 1299.66] Could be terrible.
[1299.72 → 1300.02] Yeah.
[1300.42 → 1302.02] Um, so, yeah,
[1302.06 → 1302.76] that seems like
[1302.76 → 1303.94] a pretty easy way
[1303.94 → 1305.24] for things to make
[1305.24 → 1305.80] a thousand bucks
[1305.80 → 1306.24] pretty quick.
[1306.26 → 1306.90] On a Tesla,
[1307.08 → 1307.76] you'd have to raise
[1307.76 → 1308.64] the whole car.
[1309.52 → 1309.88] Yeah.
[1310.30 → 1311.06] And then, like,
[1311.86 → 1312.62] somehow get it
[1312.62 → 1313.16] out of the bottom.
[1313.32 → 1313.92] If it was worth
[1313.92 → 1314.52] enough, I wonder
[1314.52 → 1315.38] if they'd find a way
[1315.38 → 1315.86] to do it.
[1316.86 → 1317.40] Very interesting.
[1317.40 → 1318.32] It's probably going
[1318.32 → 1319.32] to happen at some point.
[1319.42 → 1320.10] Yep, it'll probably
[1320.10 → 1321.04] happen at some point,
[1321.04 → 1322.48] but it's hilarious.
[1322.48 → 1322.90] Someone's going to
[1322.90 → 1323.86] go get their car repaired
[1323.86 → 1325.32] and not at a Tesla facility
[1325.32 → 1326.54] and they'll drop
[1326.54 → 1328.92] the relatively new battery
[1328.92 → 1329.50] out and put in
[1329.50 → 1330.24] some crappy one
[1330.24 → 1330.60] or something.
[1331.06 → 1331.88] It's hilarious.
[1332.06 → 1332.58] The, um,
[1333.00 → 1334.68] Yahoo Auto reports
[1334.68 → 1335.48] that the theft
[1335.48 → 1336.76] seemed to be localized
[1336.76 → 1338.12] to San Francisco
[1338.12 → 1339.54] at the moment.
[1340.28 → 1341.26] That's not surprising.
[1341.26 → 1342.10] They said as if
[1342.10 → 1343.00] that was somehow
[1343.00 → 1344.80] going to be a fact
[1344.80 → 1345.34] that we all
[1345.34 → 1346.92] didn't completely assume
[1346.92 → 1348.72] because I don't remember
[1348.72 → 1349.18] the last time
[1349.18 → 1350.42] I saw a Prius Hybrid.
[1351.04 → 1352.08] No, no, no.
[1352.24 → 1353.38] I've only ever seen,
[1353.46 → 1354.38] I think, one or two
[1354.38 → 1355.30] Teslas in Vancouver
[1355.30 → 1355.82] at all.
[1356.42 → 1357.74] And in the time
[1357.74 → 1358.62] we were in San Fran,
[1358.84 → 1360.10] I think we saw one or two
[1360.10 → 1361.42] like at all points in time.
[1362.42 → 1364.14] So, yeah.
[1364.52 → 1365.00] I don't know.
[1365.34 → 1366.24] Lots of places aren't
[1366.24 → 1367.22] super on the electric
[1367.22 → 1367.98] car thing yet.
[1368.54 → 1369.58] Um, other places
[1369.58 → 1370.04] totally are.
[1370.14 → 1371.10] San Fran's huge.
[1371.38 → 1372.06] I know Norway,
[1372.18 → 1373.52] they were everywhere.
[1374.06 → 1374.86] It was nuts.
[1375.46 → 1376.40] Anyway, that's,
[1376.50 → 1378.00] that's a surprisingly
[1378.00 → 1378.90] large amount of money
[1378.90 → 1379.56] that you can get
[1379.56 → 1380.36] from stealing something
[1380.36 → 1380.78] in a car
[1380.78 → 1381.94] because one thing
[1381.94 → 1382.70] with stealing cars
[1382.70 → 1383.22] is they're really
[1383.22 → 1384.06] difficult to sell.
[1384.40 → 1384.74] A lot of times
[1384.74 → 1385.62] you have to get rid
[1385.62 → 1386.02] of them for like
[1386.02 → 1386.78] scrap or whatnot.
[1387.94 → 1388.62] And they're not
[1388.62 → 1389.22] going to have too
[1389.22 → 1390.12] many pieces that
[1390.12 → 1391.12] are worth a thousand
[1391.12 → 1392.52] bucks with a ready
[1392.52 → 1393.86] buyer ready to rock.
[1393.86 → 1395.42] Now, one thing that
[1395.42 → 1396.90] people are being advised
[1396.90 → 1398.40] to do is replace the
[1398.40 → 1399.28] bolts holding in your
[1399.28 → 1400.40] battery with security
[1400.40 → 1401.82] bolts of some sort
[1401.82 → 1402.78] and that will help
[1402.78 → 1403.52] our security nuts,
[1403.66 → 1404.12] excuse me.
[1404.30 → 1404.36] Yeah.
[1404.66 → 1406.24] Um, but...
[1406.24 → 1407.02] You can also just buy
[1407.02 → 1407.32] those.
[1407.82 → 1408.86] You, uh...
[1408.86 → 1409.02] Hmm?
[1409.22 → 1409.96] You can also just buy
[1409.96 → 1410.84] the drivers for those.
[1410.96 → 1411.74] Yeah, you can buy
[1411.74 → 1412.40] the drivers for those
[1412.40 → 1413.82] but if everyone and
[1413.82 → 1414.68] their dog is using a
[1414.68 → 1415.64] different kind of,
[1415.78 → 1416.62] a kind of, you know,
[1416.66 → 1417.02] nut, I mean,
[1417.04 → 1417.56] it's going to take...
[1417.56 → 1417.68] That's true.
[1417.76 → 1418.78] It's always an arms race.
[1418.86 → 1419.38] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1419.38 → 1420.06] And thieves aren't
[1420.06 → 1420.60] going to be able to
[1420.60 → 1421.66] carry around, you know,
[1421.76 → 1422.08] 30...
[1422.08 → 1422.80] Oh, they probably can.
[1422.88 → 1425.00] But the likelihood...
[1425.00 → 1426.74] Anyway, the point for me
[1426.74 → 1428.60] is not necessarily just,
[1428.78 → 1429.46] okay, maybe they didn't
[1429.46 → 1430.02] steal your battery.
[1430.14 → 1430.86] It's that they already
[1430.86 → 1431.68] smashed your window
[1431.68 → 1432.90] and they already
[1432.90 → 1434.04] roughed up your car
[1434.04 → 1435.02] only to find out
[1435.02 → 1435.60] that you've got your
[1435.60 → 1436.22] battery in with
[1436.22 → 1437.04] security nuts.
[1437.24 → 1437.98] In which case,
[1438.08 → 1438.48] I don't know,
[1438.52 → 1439.40] do they vandalize it?
[1440.02 → 1440.38] Like...
[1440.38 → 1441.46] More?
[1442.20 → 1442.42] Yeah.
[1442.42 → 1442.64] Right?
[1443.10 → 1443.74] You know, do they
[1443.74 → 1444.56] slash your seats
[1444.56 → 1445.24] while they're at it?
[1445.28 → 1445.98] That'll teach you
[1445.98 → 1446.88] for securing your...
[1446.88 → 1447.90] I don't know.
[1447.96 → 1448.88] It doesn't seem to help
[1448.88 → 1449.66] because once someone's
[1449.66 → 1450.54] broken into your car,
[1450.62 → 1451.12] they've basically
[1451.12 → 1451.84] done the damage.
[1451.98 → 1453.52] Like, I had my car...
[1453.52 → 1454.04] Back when I used
[1454.04 → 1455.00] to lock my doors,
[1455.34 → 1456.18] I had my car
[1456.18 → 1457.44] broken into twice
[1457.44 → 1458.60] to steal my deck
[1458.60 → 1459.40] that was worth
[1459.40 → 1460.12] less than $100,
[1460.62 → 1461.56] costing me multiple
[1461.56 → 1462.38] hundreds of dollars
[1462.38 → 1463.38] in window replacements.
[1463.70 → 1464.44] So I just stopped
[1464.44 → 1465.10] locking my car.
[1465.18 → 1465.44] Fine.
[1465.52 → 1466.26] If you want my deck,
[1466.34 → 1466.92] just take it.
[1466.92 → 1467.86] And the funny thing is
[1467.86 → 1468.98] no one's taken my deck
[1468.98 → 1469.58] since then!
[1471.46 → 1472.12] Because I think
[1472.12 → 1473.46] they saw the deck
[1473.46 → 1474.28] or not,
[1474.48 → 1475.22] they broke in
[1475.22 → 1475.74] seeing if maybe
[1475.74 → 1476.66] there's anything else
[1476.66 → 1477.74] that's actually worth
[1477.74 → 1478.18] something,
[1478.18 → 1479.70] and then...
[1479.70 → 1480.46] Because I don't know
[1480.46 → 1480.82] if the deck
[1480.82 → 1481.66] is worth breaking in for.
[1481.84 → 1482.56] I don't know.
[1483.02 → 1484.04] The funny thing is
[1484.04 → 1484.58] I wonder if
[1484.58 → 1485.86] leaving your doors
[1485.86 → 1486.74] unlocked will even help
[1486.74 → 1487.38] or if people are
[1487.38 → 1487.98] just going to walk up
[1487.98 → 1488.20] to it,
[1488.32 → 1489.18] assume that it's locked
[1489.18 → 1489.78] and break the window
[1489.78 → 1490.16] anyway.
[1490.56 → 1491.50] I haven't had my window
[1491.50 → 1492.30] broken since then.
[1492.46 → 1492.90] That's true.
[1493.06 → 1494.00] So there you go.
[1494.00 → 1495.18] It happened twice
[1495.18 → 1496.54] in like three months
[1496.54 → 1497.58] back where I used to live.
[1497.66 → 1498.50] That's pretty insane.
[1498.78 → 1499.70] Yeah, that was pretty
[1499.70 → 1500.20] not cool.
[1500.20 → 1502.48] All right.
[1502.48 → 1504.86] So this is very interesting.
[1505.20 → 1506.86] We've got an update
[1506.86 → 1508.92] to the Pentium D lineup.
[1509.62 → 1511.32] And we're getting
[1511.32 → 1512.60] Leon Ds.
[1513.50 → 1514.86] And I'm all about the D.
[1515.14 → 1516.16] This was posted by
[1516.16 → 1516.92] Ah Ming.
[1517.06 → 1517.50] Oh, I am.
[1517.94 → 1519.54] And the original article here
[1519.54 → 1522.90] is from CPU-world.com.
[1522.90 → 1524.20] So we're getting
[1524.20 → 1526.76] a quad-core Pentium D.
[1527.22 → 1529.38] That's a 25 water.
[1529.90 → 1530.28] Yeah.
[1530.50 → 1531.06] However,
[1531.40 → 1531.98] I don't think
[1531.98 → 1533.24] we should be expecting
[1533.24 → 1534.26] any kinds of
[1534.26 → 1535.60] impressive clock speeds
[1535.60 → 1536.12] for that.
[1536.28 → 1537.58] And there doesn't seem
[1537.58 → 1538.70] to be any kind
[1538.70 → 1539.30] of information
[1539.30 → 1539.84] about whether
[1539.84 → 1540.88] they'll be unlocked
[1540.88 → 1542.52] like the previous
[1542.52 → 1545.06] Pentium anniversary edition.
[1545.32 → 1546.56] So just because
[1546.56 → 1548.06] Pentium Ds,
[1548.14 → 1548.66] which were,
[1548.74 → 1549.90] what did that stand for?
[1549.94 → 1550.38] I think that was
[1550.38 → 1551.52] Pentium Dual Core.
[1551.52 → 1552.82] That back when it was
[1552.82 → 1554.06] actually a high-end product.
[1554.48 → 1554.90] So just because
[1554.90 → 1555.98] the Pentium D name
[1555.98 → 1556.62] is coming back
[1556.62 → 1557.18] doesn't mean we're
[1557.18 → 1558.06] necessarily getting
[1558.06 → 1559.18] anything that's spectacular.
[1559.36 → 1559.74] Although,
[1560.30 → 1562.48] seeing a 25 watt quad-core
[1562.48 → 1563.74] with 6 legs of cache
[1563.74 → 1564.96] is looking pretty cool.
[1565.36 → 1566.42] And Leon Ds,
[1566.70 → 1568.56] hyper low power Eons,
[1568.74 → 1569.82] probably very low
[1569.82 → 1570.76] clock speed again,
[1571.02 → 1572.78] with 9 or 12 legs of cache
[1572.78 → 1574.46] at 35, 35,
[1574.68 → 1577.52] and 45 watt TDPs.
[1577.64 → 1579.08] So this is going to be
[1579.08 → 1580.96] great, mate.
[1580.96 → 1582.18] 8 out of 8
[1582.18 → 1582.94] for folks who want
[1582.94 → 1583.78] to build like,
[1584.22 → 1584.98] you know,
[1585.04 → 1586.76] a cheapo free NAS server
[1586.76 → 1587.42] for example,
[1587.72 → 1588.58] where you need
[1588.58 → 1589.98] ECC memory support,
[1590.10 → 1590.62] but you don't want
[1590.62 → 1591.10] to be spending
[1591.10 → 1592.42] multiple hundreds of dollars
[1592.42 → 1593.76] on a CPU necessarily,
[1594.30 → 1594.96] unless you're building
[1594.96 → 1596.50] like some edentulous,
[1596.66 → 1596.86] you know,
[1596.92 → 1598.08] massive high performance
[1598.08 → 1598.82] array and putting,
[1598.92 → 1599.12] you know,
[1599.16 → 1600.46] 10 gig Ethernet into it.
[1600.60 → 1601.60] There's no point.
[1601.86 → 1602.48] You might as well
[1602.48 → 1603.32] save the power
[1603.32 → 1604.22] and save the cost
[1604.22 → 1604.88] and get something
[1604.88 → 1606.06] that's pretty low end.
[1606.06 → 1608.38] There's not really
[1608.38 → 1609.16] a ton else to say
[1609.16 → 1609.52] about it,
[1609.56 → 1610.10] I don't think.
[1610.24 → 1611.56] There's a...
[1611.56 → 1611.68] Yeah,
[1611.72 → 1613.06] it's still preliminary specs.
[1613.14 → 1613.60] It doesn't really
[1613.60 → 1614.44] tell us anything.
[1614.58 → 1614.82] Yeah,
[1614.90 → 1615.94] mostly boring stuff.
[1616.02 → 1616.20] Yep.
[1616.50 → 1617.40] I guess we'll hear more
[1617.40 → 1618.24] in the relatively
[1618.24 → 1619.02] near future.
[1619.62 → 1620.52] So up next,
[1620.60 → 1621.06] we've got,
[1621.12 → 1621.68] and this was posted
[1621.68 → 1622.34] by Obscure Mammal.
[1622.34 → 1623.18] Maybe Computer?
[1623.56 → 1624.10] Maybe Computer?
[1624.10 → 1625.24] We know nothing about it,
[1625.28 → 1625.76] so...
[1625.76 → 1626.00] Yeah,
[1626.24 → 1627.18] I doubt it.
[1627.56 → 1628.00] Probably not.
[1628.02 → 1629.00] Rumours for Intel stuff
[1629.00 → 1630.10] are usually really early
[1630.10 → 1631.04] and really accurate.
[1631.18 → 1631.70] That's a good point.
[1631.70 → 1634.30] So maybe like
[1634.30 → 1635.48] Q1 next year,
[1635.54 → 1636.04] I don't know.
[1636.50 → 1636.86] Yes.
[1637.22 → 1638.18] This was posted by
[1638.18 → 1639.32] Obscure Mammal
[1639.32 → 1639.94] on the forum
[1639.94 → 1640.96] and the original article
[1640.96 → 1641.80] here is from
[1641.80 → 1642.68] Ars Technica
[1642.68 → 1643.80] and I'll let you kind of...
[1643.80 → 1644.64] If you just let me
[1644.64 → 1645.58] post it first,
[1645.70 → 1647.04] I'll be back in a moment.
[1647.96 → 1650.02] So it has infected
[1650.02 → 1651.20] a fair number
[1651.20 → 1652.14] of web servers,
[1652.50 → 1653.84] largely...
[1653.84 → 1654.70] Tens of thousands!
[1655.22 → 1656.04] Largely websites
[1656.04 → 1656.90] and mail servers
[1656.90 → 1657.56] specifically.
[1657.84 → 1659.30] It's about 8.4%
[1659.30 → 1660.00] of the top
[1660.00 → 1660.90] 1 million websites,
[1660.90 → 1662.62] so it's not an insane amount,
[1662.98 → 1663.76] but it's...
[1663.76 → 1664.32] Pretty impressive.
[1664.60 → 1665.44] ...definitely noteworthy.
[1666.48 → 1667.30] Don't worry,
[1667.44 → 1668.16] ours are fine.
[1668.54 → 1668.90] Anyway,
[1669.34 → 1671.52] basically what happens
[1671.52 → 1672.80] is you're able to
[1672.80 → 1674.68] weaken the HTTPS
[1674.68 → 1677.18] encryption bit key.
[1677.18 → 1677.58] So,
[1678.18 → 1679.18] basically,
[1679.92 → 1680.58] I think you can
[1680.58 → 1682.22] down it to 512 bits
[1682.22 → 1683.94] instead of 1024 or above.
[1684.50 → 1684.70] So,
[1686.28 → 1686.74] yeah.
[1687.14 → 1688.18] That's kind of bad
[1688.80 → 1689.70] because then people
[1689.70 → 1691.16] can crack it much easier.
[1691.28 → 1692.00] Researchers are already
[1692.00 → 1692.86] working on developing
[1692.86 → 1695.18] patches for major browsers
[1695.18 → 1695.64] like Chrome,
[1695.76 → 1696.02] Firefox,
[1696.28 → 1697.02] and Safari,
[1697.56 → 1697.94] which,
[1698.10 → 1698.72] where they will
[1698.72 → 1700.22] reject encryption connections
[1700.22 → 1701.04] that are below
[1701.04 → 1702.32] 1024 bits.
[1703.24 → 1703.60] So,
[1704.36 → 1704.64] yeah,
[1704.88 → 1705.28] I don't know.
[1705.38 → 1706.40] It's really not that big of a deal.
[1706.66 → 1706.80] Yeah,
[1706.86 → 1708.24] apparently this has been around
[1708.24 → 1709.62] for a long time.
[1709.70 → 1710.88] Most of these are around
[1710.88 → 1711.56] for a long time,
[1711.64 → 1712.12] to be honest.
[1712.12 → 1712.52] So,
[1712.64 → 1713.48] this was established,
[1713.76 → 1714.84] so basically it's just a way
[1714.84 → 1716.20] of snooping on your data
[1716.20 → 1716.78] again.
[1716.98 → 1717.16] Yeah.
[1717.20 → 1717.98] And this was established
[1717.98 → 1719.58] by the Clinton administration.
[1719.58 → 1720.06] So,
[1720.12 → 1721.30] the FBI and other agencies
[1721.30 → 1722.58] could break the encryption
[1722.58 → 1724.00] used by foreign entities.
[1724.42 → 1724.64] Yeah.
[1724.86 → 1725.20] So,
[1725.20 → 1725.58] so,
[1725.58 → 1726.40] honestly,
[1726.98 → 1728.02] you probably don't have
[1728.02 → 1728.92] much to worry about.
[1729.32 → 1730.76] It's 8.4% of websites.
[1732.66 → 1733.10] You,
[1734.10 → 1735.78] that sounds pretty worrisome.
[1736.22 → 1736.60] The
[1736.60 → 1736.86] the
[1736.86 → 1738.32] so the attack has been
[1738.32 → 1739.50] dubbed logjam.
[1740.10 → 1740.30] Yeah.
[1740.42 → 1740.92] Um,
[1741.18 → 1742.86] and it can only be exploited
[1742.86 → 1744.44] against a subset of servers
[1744.44 → 1745.44] that support the
[1745.44 → 1747.22] Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
[1747.42 → 1747.58] Yeah.
[1747.58 → 1747.88] So,
[1747.94 → 1749.08] that allows the two parties
[1749.08 → 1750.38] to exchange a secret key
[1750.38 → 1752.12] over an unsecured public channel.
[1752.28 → 1752.56] So,
[1752.62 → 1753.70] it basically takes that
[1753.70 → 1755.24] and it downgrades the encryption
[1755.24 → 1756.96] so that it can be easily cracked.
[1757.10 → 1757.34] It's,
[1757.40 → 1757.66] it's,
[1758.00 → 1758.82] still encrypted.
[1759.52 → 1759.88] Yes.
[1760.32 → 1761.00] To be clear.
[1761.12 → 1761.58] It's like,
[1761.64 → 1761.84] it's,
[1761.84 → 1763.30] it's honestly not that bad.
[1763.48 → 1764.68] It sounds a little bit worse
[1764.68 → 1765.14] than it is.
[1765.22 → 1766.40] It's not a good thing
[1766.40 → 1767.66] by any means,
[1767.82 → 1768.66] but the browser guys
[1768.66 → 1769.22] are already releasing
[1769.22 → 1770.02] patches for it.
[1770.14 → 1771.66] It's still technically encrypted.
[1771.88 → 1772.58] They're still going to have to
[1772.58 → 1773.44] fight through your stuff
[1773.44 → 1774.54] and it's still going to have to be
[1774.54 → 1775.60] kind of man in the middle attack.
[1775.72 → 1775.90] So,
[1776.24 → 1777.24] using your
[1777.24 → 1778.92] already existing knowledge
[1778.92 → 1779.78] as tech folks,
[1780.10 → 1781.48] maybe don't log into your bank
[1781.48 → 1783.04] on a public Wi-Fi network.
[1785.24 → 1785.64] Yeah.
[1786.74 → 1787.14] Um,
[1787.14 → 1787.48] and like,
[1787.52 → 1788.72] have different passwords for things.
[1789.02 → 1789.38] It's,
[1789.44 → 1790.28] it's not great,
[1790.38 → 1791.20] it's a bad thing,
[1791.20 → 1792.82] but there's been much worse
[1792.82 → 1794.02] in recent history
[1794.02 → 1795.02] in terms of like,
[1795.40 → 1796.52] online virus stuff.
[1796.64 → 1797.82] Isn't that a sad state of affairs?
[1797.82 → 1799.36] That is kind of a sad state of affairs.
[1799.70 → 1799.98] But like,
[1800.04 → 1800.26] yeah.
[1800.26 → 1801.10] That has to be your spin
[1801.10 → 1801.74] on this article.
[1801.80 → 1801.98] That's all I have to say.
[1802.16 → 1802.78] It is though.
[1802.80 → 1803.58] That's what you have to say.
[1803.60 → 1803.90] It is.
[1804.00 → 1804.16] Like,
[1804.24 → 1805.14] stuff like Heart bleed
[1805.14 → 1805.92] was way worse.
[1806.52 → 1806.82] Right.
[1807.26 → 1807.66] Um,
[1807.74 → 1809.04] and whatever the other
[1809.04 → 1809.78] recent ones were.
[1809.94 → 1811.02] I just remember Heart bleed
[1811.02 → 1812.04] because the name is really cool.
[1812.68 → 1813.04] Um,
[1813.88 → 1814.36] but yeah.
[1814.54 → 1815.02] Log Jam,
[1815.14 → 1815.88] not a good thing.
[1816.64 → 1818.00] Not as bad as it maybe sounds
[1818.00 → 1818.32] immediately.
[1818.74 → 1819.68] I'm trying to remember
[1819.68 → 1820.64] what some of the like,
[1821.14 → 1821.88] some of the
[1821.88 → 1822.86] some of the exploits
[1822.86 → 1823.28] with like,
[1823.32 → 1824.18] really cool names
[1824.18 → 1824.54] were like,
[1824.62 → 1825.72] Blaster Virus.
[1826.26 → 1826.66] Yeah.
[1827.16 → 1828.10] MS Blaster.
[1828.74 → 1830.32] Cool named viruses.
[1831.46 → 1832.62] Is someone really going to have,
[1832.70 → 1832.90] you know,
[1832.92 → 1833.50] it's the internet,
[1833.66 → 1833.84] of course they do.
[1833.84 → 1834.66] List of viruses.
[1835.10 → 1835.48] List of,
[1835.64 → 1835.84] oh.
[1836.20 → 1836.60] Oh,
[1836.72 → 1837.06] no.
[1837.32 → 1837.56] Oh,
[1837.60 → 1838.76] the top 10 most destructive
[1838.76 → 1839.62] computer viruses.
[1839.80 → 1840.42] There you go.
[1840.52 → 1840.92] There we go.
[1840.98 → 1841.60] Fourth hit.
[1841.78 → 1842.38] Of course,
[1842.46 → 1843.44] everyone's going to have,
[1843.58 → 1843.98] like,
[1843.98 → 1844.76] someone on the internet
[1844.76 → 1846.08] is going to have a list like that.
[1846.24 → 1847.28] I'm excited right now.
[1847.32 → 1848.04] So what do you get?
[1848.34 → 1848.74] Student.
[1848.90 → 1849.78] That's not that cool.
[1849.78 → 1851.04] That's not that cool sounding.
[1851.64 → 1852.00] Confider.
[1852.20 → 1852.52] No,
[1852.64 → 1853.80] that's not cool sounding.
[1854.18 → 1854.42] No.
[1854.62 → 1855.02] Zeus?
[1855.42 → 1855.82] Zeus,
[1855.92 → 1856.84] I guess so.
[1857.52 → 1857.84] My Doom.
[1857.86 → 1858.34] My Doom?
[1858.70 → 1858.94] Yeah,
[1859.06 → 1859.96] My Doom is cool.
[1860.08 → 1860.82] My Doom might win.
[1861.22 → 1861.56] Okay,
[1861.74 → 1862.08] so,
[1862.20 → 1862.58] uh,
[1862.70 → 1863.88] let's go ahead and...
[1863.88 → 1864.62] Slammer.
[1865.30 → 1866.12] Code Red.
[1866.18 → 1866.44] Okay,
[1866.52 → 1866.76] okay.
[1867.14 → 1868.14] This is getting a little old.
[1868.14 → 1869.18] Microsoft reveals
[1869.18 → 1871.16] upgrade paths to Windows 10.
[1871.28 → 1872.62] This was posted by Goodbyes
[1872.62 → 1874.12] and the original article here
[1874.12 → 1876.16] is winbeta.org.
[1876.46 → 1876.94] So,
[1877.44 → 1879.48] nothing too surprising here.
[1879.78 → 1881.64] If you have Windows 7
[1881.64 → 1883.42] or 8 or 8.1
[1883.42 → 1884.70] within the first 12 months,
[1884.74 → 1885.56] you get a free upgrade
[1885.56 → 1886.40] to Windows 10.
[1886.78 → 1887.82] This we already knew.
[1888.06 → 1889.44] So the main difference here
[1889.44 → 1890.96] is that they're explaining,
[1891.24 → 1891.46] well,
[1891.66 → 1893.02] which version you have
[1893.02 → 1893.80] which corresponds
[1893.80 → 1895.74] to which version of Windows 10.
[1895.84 → 1896.68] One thing I was wondering
[1896.68 → 1897.52] about here, though,
[1897.64 → 1898.54] isn't there
[1898.54 → 1899.44] a Windows 10 Ultimate?
[1900.28 → 1900.96] I don't think so.
[1901.56 → 1902.52] Where's that Windows 10
[1902.52 → 1903.90] versions list that we had?
[1904.00 → 1904.22] Uh,
[1904.22 → 1905.60] that's from last week
[1905.60 → 1906.20] because there's like
[1906.20 → 1908.04] 100 bazillion versions of it.
[1908.04 → 1908.18] Yeah.
[1908.18 → 1909.02] But I think in terms of
[1909.02 → 1909.70] what they're selling
[1909.70 → 1910.82] in a box to customers,
[1910.82 → 1912.24] it's going to pretty much
[1912.24 → 1913.32] be Windows 10 Home,
[1913.78 → 1914.92] Windows 10 Pro.
[1915.20 → 1915.52] Okay.
[1915.74 → 1916.76] So if you have Windows 8
[1916.76 → 1917.52] or 8.1,
[1917.58 → 1918.66] you get Windows 10 Home.
[1918.74 → 1919.58] If you have Windows 7
[1919.58 → 1920.14] Home Basic,
[1920.28 → 1921.10] which is cool,
[1921.70 → 1922.66] or Home Premium,
[1922.94 → 1924.14] you get Windows 10 Home.
[1924.50 → 1925.34] What an upgrade!
[1925.34 → 1926.50] Oh, that's pretty cool.
[1926.62 → 1927.72] Yeah, so if you...
[1927.72 → 1928.38] Home Basic, that's sick.
[1928.40 → 1929.48] If you cheaper out
[1929.48 → 1931.42] on Windows 7 Home Basic,
[1932.00 → 1933.18] which had like...
[1933.18 → 1935.06] I forget what the limitations are.
[1935.28 → 1935.62] Like when...
[1935.62 → 1936.50] Four gigs of RAM, I think.
[1936.52 → 1937.52] Was it four gigs?
[1937.52 → 1938.06] I think so.
[1938.94 → 1939.86] And it is like...
[1939.86 → 1941.06] I know there's a RAM limitation
[1941.06 → 1941.74] of some sort.
[1941.96 → 1942.40] Yeah.
[1943.22 → 1945.12] Was it even two gigs of RAM?
[1945.12 → 1945.88] It might have been two.
[1946.00 → 1946.80] I don't remember what it was.
[1946.84 → 1947.20] I just remember
[1947.20 → 1947.94] it was really super...
[1947.94 → 1948.62] It was brutal.
[1948.74 → 1949.26] It was available
[1949.26 → 1950.90] in emerging markets.
[1951.32 → 1953.20] Some Windows Aero options
[1953.20 → 1954.04] were excluded.
[1954.48 → 1954.76] Ugh.
[1955.34 → 1957.28] Activation restrictions.
[1958.00 → 1958.68] Blah, blah, blah.
[1959.56 → 1960.36] Anyway, yeah.
[1960.44 → 1961.66] It was lame.
[1962.18 → 1962.86] Someone at Twitch chat
[1962.86 → 1963.52] is going to tell us.
[1963.58 → 1964.48] Yeah, of course they are.
[1964.84 → 1966.94] So you are actually going to get
[1966.94 → 1969.02] an upgrade to Windows 10
[1969.02 → 1969.88] the real deal.
[1970.60 → 1971.36] Is it Home Basic?
[1971.62 → 1971.88] Okay.
[1972.02 → 1972.64] No, four gigs.
[1972.76 → 1973.14] Four gigs.
[1973.14 → 1974.02] People are saying both.
[1974.20 → 1974.60] Yeah, okay.
[1974.66 → 1975.00] Four gigs?
[1975.12 → 1975.20] Yeah.
[1975.72 → 1976.38] Maximum physical...
[1976.38 → 1977.50] Starter was two gigs.
[1977.56 → 1978.42] Starter was two gigs.
[1978.52 → 1979.00] That's...
[1979.00 → 1979.18] Yeah.
[1979.30 → 1980.22] That's the brutal one.
[1980.32 → 1982.76] So 32-bit is four.
[1982.88 → 1984.14] 64-bit, you could have
[1984.14 → 1985.02] eight gigs of RAM.
[1986.02 → 1987.96] There was a 64-bit version
[1987.96 → 1989.66] available, but not in retail SKUs.
[1989.84 → 1991.08] So that's another cool thing
[1991.08 → 1991.98] is you're going to be able
[1991.98 → 1993.58] to upgrade to a 64-bit OS
[1993.58 → 1995.32] if you only had a 32-bit one.
[1995.38 → 1995.82] That's cool.
[1995.92 → 1997.86] Partial support for Windows Aero.
[1998.34 → 2000.56] No built-in DVD decoder.
[2001.12 → 2001.68] Oh my goodness.
[2001.68 → 2003.30] No multitouch support.
[2003.38 → 2004.68] No Windows Media Centre.
[2005.04 → 2006.60] No premium games included.
[2007.14 → 2008.90] If anyone cares about that.
[2008.90 → 2012.08] No encrypting file system.
[2012.26 → 2013.36] No group policies.
[2013.58 → 2014.82] No Windows XP mode.
[2014.96 → 2016.30] So no backwards compatibility.
[2016.96 → 2018.34] Ease of use thing.
[2018.38 → 2019.28] I've used that before.
[2019.42 → 2020.24] It's been very useful.
[2020.76 → 2022.36] Like, lots of things.
[2022.48 → 2023.84] Basically, it's like a ginormous...
[2024.36 → 2025.14] It's just total poo.
[2025.24 → 2026.32] ...column of red.
[2027.02 → 2027.84] Total poo.
[2027.84 → 2029.64] Yeah, so this is it here.
[2029.96 → 2030.88] So super cool.
[2031.04 → 2032.88] And then if you have Windows 7
[2032.88 → 2033.82] or Windows 8,
[2034.38 → 2036.08] Ultimate or Professional,
[2036.32 → 2036.88] then you're going to get
[2036.88 → 2037.96] a copy of Windows 10 Pro.
[2038.34 → 2038.52] Yeah.
[2038.80 → 2039.46] So those...
[2039.46 → 2040.18] That all makes sense.
[2040.40 → 2041.42] Those Ultimate folks,
[2041.48 → 2042.70] they just never really got
[2042.70 → 2043.56] anything for their money,
[2043.62 → 2043.90] did they?
[2043.94 → 2044.22] No.
[2044.98 → 2046.20] No, they did not.
[2046.34 → 2047.38] It was never worth it.
[2047.40 → 2048.82] Remember when Vista launched
[2048.82 → 2050.86] and Microsoft had all those promises
[2050.86 → 2052.02] about Ultimate
[2052.02 → 2053.14] and, like, the additional,
[2053.26 → 2054.88] like, cool stuff it was going to get?
[2056.74 → 2057.92] I guess they get an update
[2057.92 → 2058.82] to Windows 10.
[2059.76 → 2060.66] No, they don't.
[2060.96 → 2061.16] No.
[2061.16 → 2061.76] Because that was Vista.
[2061.76 → 2062.24] Because...
[2062.24 → 2063.08] They get nothing.
[2063.52 → 2064.74] That would be cool.
[2065.26 → 2066.16] If Microsoft was like,
[2066.22 → 2066.64] okay.
[2067.12 → 2068.72] Do you still have this involved?
[2069.06 → 2072.10] If you actually spent
[2072.10 → 2074.88] $250 or whatever it was
[2074.88 → 2076.96] on Windows Vista Ultimate,
[2078.12 → 2079.64] we're going to give you Windows 10.
[2079.82 → 2080.76] They should have just randomly,
[2080.94 → 2082.18] like, four years down the line,
[2082.24 → 2082.58] been like,
[2082.98 → 2085.60] you all get free Office 365
[2085.60 → 2086.38] for four years.
[2086.52 → 2087.52] Or something like that.
[2087.56 → 2088.58] They should have just done something.
[2088.58 → 2089.54] Like, we like you guys.
[2090.10 → 2090.56] Because, like,
[2090.62 → 2091.66] I remember there was, like,
[2091.74 → 2092.68] Ultimate Extras
[2092.68 → 2094.22] on, like, the installation disk
[2094.22 → 2095.46] and they were stupid.
[2095.84 → 2096.60] And I was just like,
[2096.96 → 2098.02] what is this rubbish?
[2098.34 → 2098.96] So, like,
[2099.04 → 2100.76] anyone installing a legitimate OS,
[2100.84 → 2101.46] you could tell
[2101.46 → 2102.26] who was pirating.
[2102.50 → 2103.14] Because they'd have
[2103.14 → 2104.42] Windows Vista Ultimate.
[2104.70 → 2105.56] Well, yeah, yeah.
[2105.56 → 2106.98] Like, no one really installed it
[2106.98 → 2107.74] but they bought it.
[2107.82 → 2109.18] I worked in tech shops
[2109.18 → 2110.22] at that point in time.
[2110.30 → 2111.16] So, you'd go
[2111.16 → 2112.18] and you'd be updating the machine.
[2112.30 → 2112.90] You'd go to Windows Update
[2112.90 → 2114.42] and there's all the language packs.
[2114.86 → 2115.56] And it's just like...
[2115.56 → 2119.56] Just in case you...
[2119.56 → 2120.26] Obviously pirated.
[2120.28 → 2121.98] Just in case you wanted Croatian.
[2122.12 → 2122.58] Yeah, yeah.
[2123.18 → 2123.92] Well, I'm just like,
[2124.02 → 2124.56] okay, well...
[2126.04 → 2127.00] There's no way this dude
[2127.00 → 2128.68] has a legit version of Windows
[2128.68 → 2129.30] at all.
[2129.54 → 2131.30] Looking at how his setup is running.
[2131.46 → 2131.90] Yeah.
[2132.42 → 2132.86] Just like,
[2133.20 → 2133.98] Windows Ultimate
[2133.98 → 2135.34] makes zero sense
[2135.34 → 2136.48] in almost any build
[2136.48 → 2137.36] let alone this one.
[2138.36 → 2138.88] All right.
[2139.14 → 2139.90] So, let's move on
[2139.90 → 2140.46] to our next one.
[2140.60 → 2141.58] Another article
[2141.58 → 2142.98] from Ars Technica
[2142.98 → 2144.38] and the original poster here
[2144.38 → 2145.34] is Sam Fisher.
[2146.54 → 2147.06] What?
[2147.32 → 2147.84] Stealthy.
[2148.24 → 2148.76] Celebrity.
[2149.76 → 2151.40] AMD confirms
[2151.40 → 2153.90] four gigabyte limit
[2153.90 → 2156.00] for first HBM graphics card.
[2156.06 → 2156.86] Now, to be clear,
[2156.86 → 2158.74] that headline
[2158.74 → 2160.88] is a little bit misleading
[2160.88 → 2162.54] because it says
[2162.54 → 2164.10] four gigabyte limit.
[2166.00 → 2166.76] I mean,
[2166.84 → 2167.88] the amount of memory
[2167.88 → 2168.98] on a graphics card
[2168.98 → 2170.10] could be defined
[2170.10 → 2171.04] as the limit
[2171.04 → 2172.54] to the memory on it.
[2172.54 → 2174.40] But that doesn't necessarily mean
[2174.40 → 2175.78] that the rumoured
[2175.78 → 2176.54] R9 390X
[2177.10 → 2177.88] will never get
[2177.88 → 2178.74] an eight gig version.
[2179.38 → 2179.78] Right.
[2179.78 → 2180.92] All that means
[2180.92 → 2181.66] is that it's going
[2181.66 → 2182.88] to be a four gig card.
[2183.34 → 2184.28] So, calling it a limit
[2184.28 → 2185.32] is true,
[2185.50 → 2186.24] but just...
[2186.24 → 2187.54] That is super sketchy, though.
[2187.56 → 2188.82] It's really wonky wording.
[2189.12 → 2189.44] That's all.
[2189.44 → 2189.58] Yeah.
[2189.98 → 2190.76] So, basically,
[2190.96 → 2192.16] the way that HBM works
[2192.16 → 2193.28] and the problems
[2193.28 → 2194.70] with GDDR5
[2194.70 → 2196.66] are that it takes up
[2196.66 → 2197.74] a lot of space,
[2197.88 → 2198.88] which requires
[2198.88 → 2200.00] a lot of traces
[2200.00 → 2200.80] on the PCB.
[2201.16 → 2202.74] It uses a lot of power.
[2203.32 → 2204.38] So, GDDR5
[2204.38 → 2205.48] has increased
[2205.48 → 2206.68] in the last
[2206.68 → 2207.94] three years
[2207.94 → 2208.54] by what?
[2208.68 → 2209.00] Like,
[2209.62 → 2211.22] one gig transfer
[2211.22 → 2212.30] per second
[2212.30 → 2213.20] in terms of, like,
[2213.24 → 2214.16] the stock clock speeds
[2214.16 → 2214.66] on cards?
[2214.76 → 2214.96] Like,
[2215.76 → 2216.96] it's at the limit
[2216.96 → 2217.52] to the point
[2217.52 → 2218.54] where AMD is saying
[2218.54 → 2220.20] if we push GDDR5
[2220.20 → 2221.18] any further,
[2221.48 → 2222.58] we're going to use up
[2222.58 → 2223.36] so much of that
[2223.36 → 2224.22] power budget
[2224.22 → 2224.94] that they have
[2224.94 → 2226.02] to build a graphics card
[2226.02 → 2226.90] because if they want it
[2226.90 → 2228.40] to be PCI Express compliant,
[2228.88 → 2229.60] it has to fit
[2229.60 → 2230.16] within a certain
[2230.16 → 2230.80] power envelope.
[2231.02 → 2231.66] They're going to use up
[2231.66 → 2232.42] so much of that
[2232.42 → 2233.48] addressing RAM
[2233.48 → 2234.40] that they're not
[2234.40 → 2235.44] going to have enough left
[2235.44 → 2236.68] to build a GPU
[2236.68 → 2237.64] that's powerful enough
[2237.64 → 2238.74] to drive performance forward.
[2239.60 → 2240.50] With that said,
[2240.58 → 2241.22] NVIDIA hasn't had
[2241.22 → 2241.76] any trouble with that.
[2241.76 → 2242.58] I was just going to say,
[2242.88 → 2244.62] I don't know,
[2245.28 → 2246.32] maybe just make your GPU
[2246.32 → 2247.04] more efficient.
[2247.18 → 2248.24] That could be a thing.
[2248.44 → 2248.98] Well, remember,
[2249.24 → 2250.14] a big part of the problem
[2250.14 → 2250.78] right now
[2250.78 → 2251.92] is that smaller
[2251.92 → 2253.10] manufacturing processes
[2253.10 → 2254.24] are not readily available
[2254.24 → 2255.10] to the GPU guys.
[2255.18 → 2255.86] These are large,
[2256.28 → 2257.22] complicated chips,
[2257.44 → 2259.24] and we're only just now,
[2259.64 → 2260.28] finally,
[2260.64 → 2261.30] seeing Intel
[2261.30 → 2262.82] rolling out 14 nanometers
[2262.82 → 2265.02] CPUs beyond those
[2265.02 → 2265.88] Core M,
[2265.98 → 2266.32] like,
[2266.64 → 2266.98] you know,
[2267.12 → 2267.64] for like,
[2267.86 → 2268.98] Ultrabooks and tablets
[2268.98 → 2269.64] and stuff,
[2269.96 → 2270.46] processors.
[2270.68 → 2272.26] We're only just now
[2272.26 → 2272.88] seeing rumours
[2272.88 → 2273.64] that Samsung's
[2273.64 → 2274.46] going to be manufacturing
[2274.46 → 2275.86] the upcoming A9 chip
[2275.86 → 2276.44] for Apple
[2276.44 → 2277.46] at 14 nanometers.
[2277.82 → 2279.02] So GPU guys,
[2279.14 → 2279.38] I mean,
[2279.80 → 2281.10] how far down
[2281.10 → 2282.58] are they on the pecking order
[2282.58 → 2283.58] compared to Apple
[2283.58 → 2284.70] and like,
[2284.90 → 2286.54] Intel making its own stuff
[2286.54 → 2287.80] in its own fabs
[2287.80 → 2288.72] that it doesn't
[2288.72 → 2289.50] lease to others?
[2289.76 → 2289.98] No.
[2290.26 → 2290.58] So,
[2291.10 → 2291.42] never.
[2292.42 → 2293.48] Can you imagine
[2293.48 → 2294.96] an AMD graphics chip
[2294.96 → 2296.22] being manufactured
[2296.22 → 2296.80] by Intel?
[2298.80 → 2299.36] Nope.
[2299.60 → 2300.20] In a world.
[2300.40 → 2301.44] I literally can't.
[2301.68 → 2303.26] I can't even join your story.
[2303.52 → 2304.50] I literally can't imagine that.
[2304.50 → 2305.46] You're just not even gonna,
[2305.64 → 2307.24] you're not going to walk down this,
[2307.50 → 2308.96] go down this rabbit hole
[2308.96 → 2309.46] with me, eh?
[2309.54 → 2310.72] Just imagine how scary
[2310.72 → 2311.32] that would be.
[2311.88 → 2312.14] I mean,
[2312.48 → 2313.46] would Intel be able
[2313.46 → 2314.26] to talk them into
[2314.26 → 2315.06] having like,
[2315.12 → 2315.40] you know,
[2315.48 → 2316.74] like a little eye even?
[2317.04 → 2317.28] You know,
[2317.42 → 2318.46] like a year number,
[2318.64 → 2319.72] like date stamped on,
[2319.82 → 2320.48] like...
[2320.48 → 2322.32] I...
[2322.32 → 2323.26] I don't know
[2323.26 → 2323.76] if I would even
[2323.76 → 2324.52] want to see that.
[2324.90 → 2325.56] Just do like
[2325.56 → 2326.48] double-digit things.
[2326.82 → 2327.00] So,
[2327.14 → 2327.72] i13,
[2328.52 → 2329.20] i15,
[2329.34 → 2329.86] i17.
[2330.82 → 2331.22] Um,
[2331.42 → 2331.70] okay,
[2331.76 → 2332.42] what else can we say
[2332.42 → 2332.82] about it?
[2332.96 → 2333.10] So,
[2333.18 → 2334.52] this is cool.
[2335.48 → 2335.72] So,
[2335.84 → 2336.46] AMD says
[2336.46 → 2337.38] one gigabyte
[2337.38 → 2338.34] of GDDR5
[2338.34 → 2338.80] takes up
[2338.80 → 2340.62] 672 millimetres
[2340.62 → 2341.64] squared of space
[2341.64 → 2342.66] versus a
[2342.66 → 2344.08] one gigabyte stack.
[2344.28 → 2344.52] So,
[2344.56 → 2345.14] they have like
[2345.14 → 2346.38] these through-fares
[2346.38 → 2347.76] through the stacked memory
[2347.76 → 2348.96] of HBM
[2348.96 → 2349.52] that takes up
[2349.52 → 2351.04] just 35 millimetres
[2351.04 → 2351.40] squared.
[2351.54 → 2351.68] So,
[2351.84 → 2352.58] this is something
[2352.58 → 2353.24] that's kind of funny
[2353.24 → 2354.26] because one of the
[2354.26 → 2355.32] renders floating around
[2355.32 → 2356.34] of the 390X
[2356.34 → 2357.56] had it as like
[2357.56 → 2358.46] a stubby card.
[2359.30 → 2360.24] With the amount
[2360.24 → 2360.94] of space
[2360.94 → 2361.86] that AMD is saving
[2361.86 → 2362.44] on the PCB,
[2362.72 → 2363.36] what are they gonna
[2363.36 → 2363.90] put on it?
[2364.42 → 2364.70] Yeah,
[2364.88 → 2365.12] really.
[2365.30 → 2365.98] Power delivery
[2365.98 → 2367.44] and a GPU
[2367.44 → 2368.90] and like...
[2368.90 → 2369.72] Little any bit
[2369.72 → 2370.98] like four
[2370.98 → 2371.96] memory chips.
[2372.24 → 2372.54] Because like,
[2372.60 → 2372.84] remember,
[2372.98 → 2373.50] like one of the
[2373.50 → 2374.06] marks of a
[2374.06 → 2375.00] high-end card
[2375.00 → 2375.66] was like
[2375.66 → 2376.48] the big PCB
[2376.48 → 2377.40] with like,
[2377.94 → 2378.28] you know,
[2378.54 → 2379.90] 12 memory chips
[2379.90 → 2380.98] on each side
[2380.98 → 2381.36] of it
[2381.36 → 2382.34] because it had
[2382.34 → 2383.34] so much RAM.
[2383.44 → 2383.48] Well,
[2383.50 → 2384.12] we're not necessarily
[2384.12 → 2384.70] even gonna need
[2384.70 → 2385.16] that anymore.
[2385.28 → 2385.44] I mean,
[2385.56 → 2386.12] one approach
[2386.12 → 2386.52] could be that
[2386.52 → 2387.10] we could start
[2387.10 → 2387.94] putting 16 to
[2387.94 → 2388.82] 24 gigs of RAM
[2388.82 → 2389.26] on a GPU.
[2389.26 → 2389.48] yeah,
[2389.98 → 2391.58] 64 gigs of RAM.
[2392.10 → 2392.54] But,
[2392.94 → 2393.66] I don't think
[2393.66 → 2394.28] we're at a point
[2394.28 → 2394.98] yet where the
[2394.98 → 2395.60] data integrity...
[2395.60 → 2395.86] Put the entire
[2395.86 → 2396.94] game into VRAM.
[2397.02 → 2397.20] Yeah,
[2397.28 → 2397.82] like the data
[2397.82 → 2398.60] integrity is not
[2398.60 → 2399.16] even going to be
[2399.16 → 2399.82] high enough
[2399.82 → 2401.36] to put that
[2401.36 → 2401.94] much memory
[2401.94 → 2402.62] on a GPU
[2402.62 → 2403.50] at this stage.
[2404.10 → 2404.60] You'd have to
[2404.60 → 2405.64] put ECC memory
[2405.64 → 2406.06] on it.
[2406.80 → 2407.50] That would be
[2407.50 → 2407.96] pretty cool,
[2408.04 → 2408.14] though,
[2408.18 → 2408.74] if you could
[2408.74 → 2409.70] load the whole
[2409.70 → 2410.32] game into
[2410.32 → 2411.20] all the game's
[2411.20 → 2411.72] texture files
[2411.72 → 2412.32] into VRAM.
[2412.50 → 2413.12] You know what?
[2413.16 → 2413.86] This actually
[2413.86 → 2414.82] ties in pretty
[2414.82 → 2415.58] well to
[2415.58 → 2416.82] a tweet.
[2417.92 → 2418.66] A tweet?
[2419.16 → 2419.48] Oh,
[2419.50 → 2420.26] it's from my
[2420.26 → 2421.70] good buddy,
[2421.82 → 2422.62] Johan Anderson.
[2423.34 → 2423.62] Okay,
[2423.68 → 2424.30] I met him once.
[2424.64 → 2425.26] But he's really
[2425.26 → 2425.72] nice.
[2426.14 → 2427.00] Super nice.
[2427.00 → 2428.48] Super nice.
[2428.60 → 2429.52] He is like
[2429.52 → 2430.40] the guy
[2430.40 → 2431.28] for Frostbite.
[2431.50 → 2431.72] So,
[2432.20 → 2433.04] there you go.
[2433.38 → 2434.16] This actually
[2434.16 → 2435.36] looks a lot
[2435.36 → 2435.74] like...
[2435.74 → 2436.06] That looks
[2436.06 → 2436.94] really nice.
[2436.96 → 2437.38] ...the render.
[2438.66 → 2439.02] Okay,
[2439.16 → 2439.60] so hold on.
[2439.70 → 2440.10] Does it look
[2440.10 → 2440.56] like a stubby
[2440.56 → 2440.74] card?
[2442.52 → 2442.92] Yeah.
[2443.58 → 2444.28] Is that the
[2444.28 → 2444.58] end of the
[2444.58 → 2444.80] card?
[2446.02 → 2446.42] Maybe.
[2446.64 → 2447.18] It could also
[2447.18 → 2447.92] just be a
[2447.92 → 2448.56] shiny part.
[2449.08 → 2449.20] Yeah.
[2449.20 → 2449.46] And that could
[2449.46 → 2449.78] be the end
[2449.78 → 2450.28] of the black.
[2450.40 → 2450.58] Oh,
[2450.70 → 2451.24] I'm not
[2451.24 → 2451.76] screen sharing.
[2451.92 → 2452.58] I'm sorry.
[2452.76 → 2453.18] Very good.
[2453.28 → 2453.78] There we go.
[2453.82 → 2454.36] Very, very good.
[2454.42 → 2454.86] So, we're just
[2454.86 → 2455.56] wondering if this
[2455.56 → 2455.86] is...
[2455.86 → 2456.40] I don't know.
[2456.40 → 2458.08] Yeah, I see that.
[2458.08 → 2458.82] I see the pixels.
[2459.08 → 2459.52] You could definitely
[2459.52 → 2459.96] be right.
[2460.20 → 2460.70] It could also
[2460.70 → 2461.52] just be a shiny
[2461.52 → 2462.24] reflection thing.
[2462.50 → 2462.90] Enhance!
[2463.48 → 2464.52] Dun dun dun.
[2464.76 → 2465.16] Enhance.
[2465.30 → 2466.10] No, I think so.
[2466.72 → 2467.44] Yeah, no, you could...
[2467.44 → 2467.94] Now that we've
[2467.94 → 2468.52] enhanced it.
[2468.76 → 2469.12] Now that...
[2469.12 → 2469.38] Yes.
[2469.60 → 2470.54] It was only because
[2470.54 → 2471.06] of the enhancement.
[2471.70 → 2472.42] I didn't wave my
[2472.42 → 2472.84] hand enough.
[2473.08 → 2473.48] Enhance!
[2474.04 → 2474.44] Enhance.
[2474.84 → 2475.38] Zoom in there.
[2475.52 → 2475.88] Zoom in.
[2475.94 → 2476.54] You press the hot
[2476.54 → 2477.12] key while I wave
[2477.12 → 2477.50] my hand.
[2479.18 → 2479.58] Enhance!
[2480.22 → 2480.62] Enhance!
[2480.62 → 2481.40] Why?
[2481.40 → 2481.44] Why?
[2482.50 → 2482.90] Why?
[2483.42 → 2484.34] I want to see that
[2484.34 → 2486.68] emoji closer.
[2487.08 → 2487.46] Emoji?
[2487.58 → 2488.20] It's happy.
[2489.00 → 2490.86] Should I keep calling
[2490.86 → 2491.92] them emoticons?
[2492.42 → 2493.28] Because, like, I'm the
[2493.28 → 2493.98] older generation.
[2494.18 → 2495.02] That's what we used to
[2495.02 → 2495.36] call them.
[2495.36 → 2495.90] Well, that's an emoticon.
[2497.02 → 2498.00] Wait, they're different?
[2498.26 → 2500.06] Is an emoji the icon?
[2501.16 → 2502.44] Well, we used to call the...
[2502.44 → 2503.16] We used to call...
[2503.16 → 2504.40] You mean, like, the image-based
[2504.40 → 2504.74] ones, right?
[2504.76 → 2504.96] Yeah.
[2505.10 → 2505.84] We used to call those
[2505.84 → 2506.54] emoticons, too.
[2507.04 → 2507.66] Yeah, I...
[2507.66 → 2508.02] Yeah.
[2508.20 → 2508.58] I did.
[2509.00 → 2509.26] Yeah.
[2509.72 → 2510.04] So...
[2510.04 → 2511.42] Are emoji, like, a
[2511.42 → 2512.24] specific thing?
[2512.40 → 2513.52] This could be a great
[2513.52 → 2514.50] discussion topic.
[2516.36 → 2518.10] Emoji versus emoticon.
[2518.64 → 2520.00] Theguardian.com has an
[2520.00 → 2521.20] article from February 6th.
[2521.20 → 2522.18] We should do as fast as
[2522.18 → 2523.10] possible on this.
[2523.18 → 2524.46] Alex Hearn sets the
[2524.46 → 2526.60] record straight once and
[2526.60 → 2527.20] for all.
[2527.26 → 2528.40] Okay, I have to know.
[2528.74 → 2529.22] I do, too.
[2529.28 → 2529.94] I'm really interested.
[2530.04 → 2530.70] I'll read with you.
[2530.70 → 2532.22] They are not the same
[2532.22 → 2532.64] thing.
[2533.00 → 2533.14] Okay.
[2533.42 → 2534.54] And this is bold.
[2534.54 → 2536.24] The Continued Confusion of
[2536.24 → 2537.80] the Two Will Not Stand.
[2538.28 → 2538.60] Ah!
[2539.06 → 2540.08] It's not bold, actually.
[2540.18 → 2540.74] Um...
[2540.74 → 2541.66] But I wish it was.
[2542.00 → 2543.72] At issue was a piece of
[2543.72 → 2544.94] information that the Silk
[2544.94 → 2546.14] Road founder's lawyer
[2546.14 → 2547.20] suggested was critically
[2547.20 → 2548.78] important, yet was
[2548.78 → 2549.76] emitted by federal
[2549.76 → 2550.44] prosecutors.
[2550.66 → 2551.22] An emoji.
[2552.18 → 2552.84] This is what sometimes
[2552.84 → 2554.00] calls a version of a
[2554.00 → 2554.96] smiley face.
[2555.82 → 2557.00] An emoticon is a
[2557.00 → 2558.80] typographic display of a
[2558.80 → 2559.62] facial representation,
[2560.28 → 2561.08] like this.
[2561.34 → 2562.34] And there you go.
[2562.40 → 2563.08] It looks like you're
[2563.08 → 2563.34] right.
[2563.34 → 2565.36] An emoji is apparently
[2565.36 → 2567.76] an actual picture.
[2568.86 → 2569.30] Okay.
[2569.58 → 2570.62] So, like, your little
[2570.62 → 2572.46] Skype or Google Hangouts
[2572.46 → 2574.74] little emoji things are
[2574.74 → 2575.12] emojis.
[2575.54 → 2576.70] And actually typing, like,
[2576.78 → 2578.12] colon bracket is a
[2578.12 → 2578.38] emoticon.
[2578.62 → 2580.16] So, emoji are treated by
[2580.16 → 2580.86] the computer.
[2580.98 → 2581.58] This is an important
[2581.58 → 2581.96] distinction.
[2582.08 → 2583.46] So, the reason we care is
[2583.46 → 2584.34] not because the meaning is
[2584.34 → 2585.46] different, but because
[2585.46 → 2586.72] emoji are treated by the
[2586.72 → 2588.14] computer as letters from a
[2588.14 → 2589.84] non-Western language in
[2589.84 → 2590.60] much the same way that a
[2590.60 → 2592.22] Japanese or Chinese character
[2592.22 → 2592.56] would.
[2592.78 → 2593.04] Interesting.
[2593.04 → 2594.08] Which also means that the
[2594.08 → 2596.32] software has to explicitly
[2596.32 → 2597.36] support them.
[2597.76 → 2599.00] So, all this makes perfect
[2599.00 → 2599.76] sense to me.
[2599.84 → 2601.90] Now, I think this distinction
[2601.90 → 2603.18] must have come later,
[2603.50 → 2606.34] because, to my knowledge,
[2606.48 → 2607.90] MSN Messenger, which is
[2607.90 → 2609.78] where I cut my teeth on
[2609.78 → 2611.28] online chat, sort of.
[2611.28 → 2612.76] I guess I was also on, uh,
[2613.36 → 2614.46] what was that other one?
[2614.80 → 2615.46] ICQ, right.
[2616.36 → 2616.84] I wasn't.
[2616.84 → 2617.04] Uh-oh.
[2617.26 → 2618.32] I was Messenger forever.
[2618.60 → 2619.32] Only Messenger.
[2619.48 → 2620.90] You're too young for ICQ,
[2621.00 → 2621.44] pretty much.
[2621.62 → 2622.76] Like, it was already dying.
[2623.22 → 2623.42] Yeah.
[2623.54 → 2624.14] It was dying.
[2624.26 → 2625.02] It was falling off pretty
[2625.02 → 2625.24] quick.
[2625.36 → 2626.26] I knew people that had it.
[2626.38 → 2627.06] I knew people that wanted
[2627.06 → 2627.98] me to get it, but it was,
[2628.10 → 2629.12] like, kind of falling out of
[2629.12 → 2629.36] grace.
[2629.50 → 2630.84] So, MSN Messenger called
[2630.84 → 2632.98] them emoticons or emoticons
[2632.98 → 2635.46] even once, even once that,
[2635.56 → 2637.42] once they had, like, real
[2637.42 → 2638.16] images in it, so.
[2638.34 → 2638.50] Yeah.
[2639.04 → 2639.54] All right.
[2639.54 → 2640.64] Well, oh, oh, right.
[2640.72 → 2641.88] We should probably do our,
[2641.88 → 2642.64] our sponsors.
[2643.40 → 2644.70] Sponsor call-outs.
[2645.74 → 2647.18] Are we going to do, like,
[2647.42 → 2648.78] manly sponsor call-outs?
[2648.88 → 2649.34] We could.
[2650.04 → 2651.34] Should I sabotage Nick?
[2652.38 → 2652.86] Sabotage Nick.
[2652.86 → 2653.26] All right.
[2653.34 → 2655.48] So, our first sponsor is
[2655.48 → 2656.62] FreshBooks.
[2657.74 → 2658.18] FreshBooks.
[2658.38 → 2660.22] FreshBooks.com slash WAN.
[2660.32 → 2661.14] So, what is FreshBooks,
[2661.26 → 2661.62] you might ask?
[2661.62 → 2661.98] You know that smell of a new
[2661.98 → 2662.26] book?
[2662.68 → 2663.56] That's not it.
[2663.78 → 2664.54] But it smells good.
[2664.56 → 2665.82] There is no book involved.
[2665.98 → 2666.38] No, actually.
[2666.38 → 2668.74] But it is a fresh way of doing
[2668.74 → 2669.82] your bookkeeping.
[2670.14 → 2670.40] It is.
[2670.40 → 2671.66] See how I brought that train
[2671.66 → 2672.88] right back on the rails?
[2673.06 → 2673.26] Yep.
[2673.28 → 2674.92] So, FreshBooks is an online tool
[2674.92 → 2676.12] if you run your own business
[2676.12 → 2677.56] and you're self-employed,
[2677.58 → 2678.74] or they're both very similar,
[2678.84 → 2679.14] I guess.
[2679.28 → 2680.02] The point is,
[2680.08 → 2681.12] if you're your own boss,
[2681.44 → 2682.76] FreshBooks allows you to
[2682.76 → 2684.58] keep track of little things,
[2684.60 → 2686.30] like how many hours you worked
[2686.30 → 2687.62] on a particular job,
[2688.04 → 2690.46] any invoices that you have to
[2690.46 → 2692.12] expense for a particular job,
[2692.24 → 2693.96] creating the invoice for your clients,
[2694.42 → 2695.62] sending it off to them,
[2695.62 → 2696.94] seeing that they've read it,
[2697.48 → 2699.62] that is such a huge thing.
[2699.70 → 2700.14] It's kind of cool.
[2700.20 → 2701.22] Like, as someone who,
[2701.38 → 2702.86] it's stuff like that
[2702.86 → 2703.72] that gets my attention.
[2703.88 → 2704.04] It's like,
[2704.12 → 2706.00] so they can't claim
[2706.00 → 2707.66] that they didn't get my invoice?
[2708.44 → 2710.04] Not to mention that with FreshBooks,
[2710.12 → 2711.62] you don't have to muck around
[2711.62 → 2713.38] in your existing accounting software.
[2713.70 → 2714.64] You'll have it with you,
[2714.84 → 2715.60] on the go,
[2715.74 → 2716.92] and your customers can even
[2716.92 → 2718.26] pay you by credit card,
[2718.54 → 2719.92] making it easy for you
[2719.92 → 2721.02] to know they got the bill
[2721.02 → 2722.86] and easier for them to pay it.
[2722.86 → 2724.50] If you want to feel like a boss,
[2724.74 → 2726.14] then go ahead and use products
[2726.14 → 2727.40] that make you feel like a boss.
[2727.50 → 2729.22] Visit freshbooks.com slash WAN,
[2729.60 → 2731.72] and in how did you hear about us,
[2732.06 → 2733.38] enter WAN.
[2734.38 → 2734.82] WAN.
[2735.26 → 2736.04] WAN, just WAN.
[2736.36 → 2737.08] WAN show.
[2737.14 → 2737.82] They're not going to know
[2737.82 → 2738.50] what they mean.
[2738.58 → 2739.54] Just WAN.
[2739.60 → 2740.60] Well, they'll probably know.
[2740.72 → 2740.94] All right.
[2740.94 → 2741.58] We had WAN.
[2741.64 → 2742.76] Next up, oh, where's your kit?
[2743.98 → 2744.96] ifixit.com.
[2745.24 → 2746.70] Why do we like these guys?
[2746.86 → 2748.44] Because they save our butts
[2748.44 → 2749.50] on a daily basis.
[2750.30 → 2750.70] What?
[2751.00 → 2751.68] I have this thing.
[2751.68 → 2752.48] You have what thing?
[2752.60 → 2752.96] This thing.
[2753.02 → 2753.54] Oh, right.
[2753.72 → 2754.68] Is there audio?
[2755.04 → 2755.94] No, I don't think so.
[2756.06 → 2756.32] But.
[2756.58 → 2757.96] Well, that's the thing I'm holding,
[2758.12 → 2758.78] and that's their.
[2758.78 → 2759.62] It looks better, though.
[2759.76 → 2761.66] That's their Pro-Tech toolkit
[2761.66 → 2762.92] that we absolutely love.
[2763.00 → 2763.60] Brandon did it.
[2763.64 → 2764.76] So there's like some
[2764.76 → 2766.34] tricking screwdrivers,
[2766.46 → 2767.52] security Torres,
[2767.78 → 2769.26] there's your anti-static wrist strap.
[2769.34 → 2770.48] Which we used in the Makey video.
[2770.48 → 2771.46] Which you should always wear.
[2771.88 → 2772.82] There's some little
[2772.82 → 2774.60] prying tools and pokers.
[2774.98 → 2775.46] You know, it's funny.
[2775.60 → 2776.28] The blue ones
[2776.28 → 2777.70] are the ones that I thought
[2777.70 → 2778.38] were important,
[2778.38 → 2780.32] but it turns out
[2780.32 → 2781.64] I was using the blue ones
[2781.64 → 2783.00] in a lot of situations
[2783.00 → 2784.30] where I was actually
[2784.30 → 2785.38] supposed to use the black ones?
[2785.38 → 2786.60] Supposed to use this one.
[2786.60 → 2786.76] The ESD ones.
[2787.14 → 2787.40] Yeah.
[2787.66 → 2789.18] So this one is,
[2789.34 → 2789.66] well, no,
[2789.70 → 2790.72] it's not about the ESD.
[2790.80 → 2791.74] I thought that one was ESD.
[2791.80 → 2793.24] It's about the fact that
[2793.24 → 2794.94] it doesn't get damaged
[2794.94 → 2795.38] as easily
[2795.38 → 2796.14] when you're poking at stuff.
[2796.14 → 2796.68] It's made out of
[2796.68 → 2797.64] a bit of a harder plastic.
[2797.72 → 2798.06] Interesting.
[2798.06 → 2800.08] So this one is a harder plastic
[2800.08 → 2801.20] for kind of working on metal.
[2801.38 → 2802.06] Whereas that,
[2802.30 → 2803.00] the blue ones
[2803.00 → 2804.46] are soft enough
[2804.46 → 2806.44] that you can work on plastic
[2806.44 → 2808.10] without accidentally damaging it.
[2808.24 → 2808.42] Cool.
[2808.46 → 2809.36] So they've got lots
[2809.36 → 2810.26] of different stuff in there,
[2810.32 → 2811.82] a variety of different tweezers.
[2812.14 → 2812.68] Want to know something
[2812.68 → 2813.58] I discovered recently?
[2814.00 → 2814.22] What?
[2815.12 → 2817.22] In the screwdriver kit,
[2817.72 → 2819.20] one of these at the top
[2819.20 → 2820.08] is not a socket.
[2820.54 → 2821.66] It's actually a magnet.
[2822.76 → 2823.32] Oh, no way.
[2823.40 → 2824.06] Yeah, it's a socket
[2824.06 → 2825.02] with a magnet in it.
[2825.08 → 2825.82] Okay, that's pretty cool.
[2825.82 → 2826.72] I actually had no idea.
[2826.80 → 2827.84] Yeah, it's a little Gabby tool.
[2828.06 → 2828.72] And you know what's funny
[2828.72 → 2830.48] is I realized that
[2830.48 → 2831.46] and immediately lost it.
[2831.46 → 2832.12] I would legit use it.
[2832.20 → 2832.56] Oh.
[2833.00 → 2833.62] Then I found it.
[2833.62 → 2834.04] Okay.
[2834.48 → 2835.02] So anyway,
[2835.10 → 2835.88] the Protect Toolkit
[2835.88 → 2837.20] is just one of the products
[2837.20 → 2838.22] on fixity's website
[2838.22 → 2839.30] that allows you to easily,
[2839.48 → 2840.32] well, fix.
[2841.30 → 2841.60] Oh.
[2841.80 → 2842.54] Or just tear apart
[2842.54 → 2843.18] and not fix.
[2843.36 → 2844.42] You know, whatever, cowboy.
[2844.86 → 2846.30] To fix your electronics.
[2846.64 → 2847.72] So the cool thing here...
[2847.72 → 2849.02] Ignore that offer code.
[2849.06 → 2850.28] Oh, ignore that offer code.
[2850.30 → 2851.66] It is Wansho06.
[2852.04 → 2852.44] Wans ho...
[2852.44 → 2853.46] Wow, we're that far behind?
[2853.48 → 2854.28] You will save $10
[2854.28 → 2855.38] off any purchase
[2855.38 → 2856.42] of $50 or more.
[2856.60 → 2857.66] And the Protect Toolkit
[2857.66 → 2858.62] is $64.95.
[2858.96 → 2859.50] So...
[2859.50 → 2861.12] Basically, it's $54.95.
[2861.44 → 2861.90] Go hard.
[2862.06 → 2862.28] Yeah.
[2862.54 → 2863.18] All right.
[2863.18 → 2865.26] Finally, we've got Squarespace.
[2865.90 → 2867.18] Squarespace is one of the
[2867.18 → 2868.66] the longest standing sponsors
[2868.66 → 2869.52] of the Wans ho.
[2869.98 → 2871.88] And what can we say?
[2871.96 → 2873.00] We love those guys.
[2873.14 → 2873.84] It's pretty much
[2873.84 → 2875.84] the way to build your website
[2875.84 → 2877.10] easily, quickly,
[2877.48 → 2878.28] and affordably.
[2878.52 → 2879.56] I use them personally
[2879.56 → 2882.22] and not as a sponsorship thing.
[2882.32 → 2883.24] I specifically didn't go
[2883.24 → 2883.92] through our contacts.
[2884.34 → 2884.60] Really?
[2884.86 → 2885.06] Yeah.
[2885.16 → 2885.76] I actually didn't know
[2885.76 → 2886.22] that part of it.
[2886.26 → 2886.42] Yeah.
[2886.90 → 2887.94] No, I think you told me
[2887.94 → 2888.40] that before.
[2888.64 → 2888.78] Yeah.
[2888.78 → 2889.42] I remember saying
[2889.42 → 2890.20] I didn't know that.
[2890.40 → 2890.62] Probably.
[2890.62 → 2891.44] So at one point,
[2891.86 → 2892.72] I didn't know that.
[2893.42 → 2894.04] Which was now.
[2894.14 → 2895.16] And then I didn't know it again.
[2895.46 → 2895.68] Yeah.
[2897.04 → 2898.16] So the point is,
[2898.44 → 2899.30] if you want your site
[2899.30 → 2900.16] to look beautiful
[2900.16 → 2901.66] and operate smoothly,
[2901.66 → 2902.92] whether it's on a phone
[2902.92 → 2904.62] or whether it's on...
[2904.62 → 2906.42] A tablet or a computer.
[2906.42 → 2908.30] Whatever the case may be,
[2908.42 → 2909.72] no coding is required.
[2909.84 → 2910.14] However,
[2910.30 → 2911.66] if you do know some coding,
[2911.78 → 2912.56] then you can actually
[2912.56 → 2913.34] play around with it
[2913.34 → 2913.86] a little bit
[2913.86 → 2915.04] and get into the nuts and bolts
[2915.04 → 2916.48] as well.
[2916.94 → 2918.84] Their templates are beautiful.
[2919.02 → 2919.28] They're great
[2919.28 → 2920.24] if you want to make a blog,
[2920.36 → 2921.36] if you want to make a portfolio,
[2921.62 → 2922.94] if you want to run a store.
[2923.20 → 2923.32] Store.
[2923.46 → 2924.72] Yeah, their commerce stuff is great.
[2924.80 → 2925.46] The commerce stuff
[2925.46 → 2926.20] is a big one
[2926.20 → 2926.76] that they've added
[2926.76 → 2927.26] in the time
[2927.26 → 2927.88] that we've actually
[2927.88 → 2928.84] been talking about them
[2928.84 → 2929.44] on Wan show.
[2929.52 → 2930.04] Store software
[2930.04 → 2931.30] is way better than ours.
[2931.66 → 2932.44] I've kind of been thinking
[2932.44 → 2933.62] about just redirecting
[2933.62 → 2934.78] the button that you click.
[2934.78 → 2935.54] We should probably
[2935.54 → 2936.28] actually do that.
[2936.42 → 2936.56] Yeah.
[2936.68 → 2937.12] Straight up.
[2937.18 → 2938.26] I was thinking about that too
[2938.26 → 2939.40] and then I forgot to tell you.
[2939.94 → 2941.20] So it's an idea.
[2941.34 → 2941.86] It's probably just
[2941.86 → 2942.78] a way better idea
[2942.78 → 2943.98] because our storefront
[2943.98 → 2944.42] is terrible.
[2944.42 → 2945.76] It's just balling.
[2945.78 → 2946.08] Anyway,

[2958.96 → 2959.44] Squarespace.
[2959.72 → 2960.08] Squarespace.
[2960.08 → 2960.52] Build it beautiful.
[2962.36 → 2963.14] It's in the notes.
[2963.18 → 2964.76] I know it's in the notes.
[2964.78 → 2965.90] I'm just following the notes.
[2965.90 → 2966.30] All right.
[2966.54 → 2967.44] So this is the part
[2967.44 → 2969.20] where I don't screw over Nick
[2969.20 → 2970.44] because I wasn't talking
[2970.44 → 2971.18] about getting all
[2971.18 → 2972.40] the sponsor reads wrong.
[2972.52 → 2973.44] Not that that hasn't
[2973.44 → 2974.20] happened before.
[2974.84 → 2976.52] Nick and I have a bet.
[2977.18 → 2978.04] This is a pretty
[2978.04 → 2980.52] serious business bet.
[2980.66 → 2981.54] It's a lot more serious
[2981.54 → 2982.20] than I think he's
[2982.20 → 2983.24] really going to put on.
[2983.34 → 2983.50] Yeah.
[2983.56 → 2984.54] I'm not going to tell you
[2984.54 → 2985.36] guys what it is,
[2985.40 → 2986.08] but if you're subscribed
[2986.08 → 2987.06] to Channel Super Fun,
[2987.20 → 2987.92] you are going to see
[2987.92 → 2989.02] the result one way
[2989.02 → 2989.46] or another.
[2989.62 → 2989.96] Oh my God.
[2989.96 → 2990.48] And it's going to
[2990.48 → 2991.44] either be amazing
[2991.44 → 2992.50] or really unpleasant.
[2992.50 → 2995.18] So pretty much
[2995.18 → 2996.52] we have
[2996.52 → 2997.54] Pretty much you're screwed.
[2997.92 → 2998.34] Finally,
[2998.52 → 3000.04] I have refused
[3000.04 → 3001.60] for so long.
[3002.04 → 3003.34] He's pushed for it.
[3003.52 → 3003.76] Yep.
[3004.02 → 3005.14] Nick's pushed for it.
[3005.26 → 3006.78] My wife's pushed for it.
[3007.16 → 3008.66] Everyone has wanted this
[3008.66 → 3010.76] for quite some time.
[3010.84 → 3011.68] Can you post that please?
[3011.68 → 3012.14] Thank you.
[3012.14 → 3012.18] Yeah, I got it.
[3012.18 → 3012.66] It was like
[3012.66 → 3015.08] just a plain Linus Tech Tips shirt.
[3015.70 → 3016.82] I always kind of went,
[3017.22 → 3018.36] so like if you feel like
[3018.36 → 3019.94] why would I want a Linus Tech Tips logo
[3019.94 → 3020.58] on my chest?
[3021.28 → 3022.38] I've always been with you.
[3022.56 → 3023.88] It never made any sense to me.
[3024.24 → 3025.50] Linus Tech Tips to me
[3025.50 → 3027.36] was like not the kind of thing.
[3027.40 → 3027.62] I just,
[3027.90 → 3029.40] it's not that I didn't want one.
[3029.48 → 3030.70] Like I'm proud to wear it,
[3030.76 → 3031.14] but I just,
[3031.30 → 3031.74] I wasn't,
[3031.84 → 3032.66] I didn't know
[3032.66 → 3033.66] that our viewers
[3033.66 → 3034.60] were going to be like,
[3034.68 → 3035.50] would be amped up
[3035.50 → 3036.66] about like just a plain,
[3037.00 → 3038.32] clean Linus Tech Tips shirt.
[3038.56 → 3039.94] So I refused to make one.
[3040.04 → 3040.34] I was like,
[3040.38 → 3040.50] no,
[3040.56 → 3041.20] let's have like
[3041.20 → 3042.84] bro fist on the front
[3042.84 → 3043.40] or like,
[3044.00 → 3044.28] you know,
[3044.32 → 3045.38] a picture of a cat.
[3045.50 → 3046.56] Which are cool.
[3046.62 → 3047.54] Like a naughty word on it.
[3047.54 → 3048.70] And all of those are great things,
[3048.88 → 3050.92] but we are finally doing it.
[3051.58 → 3052.92] A Linus Tech Tips shirt.
[3053.06 → 3054.52] Now this one will be available
[3054.52 → 3055.68] in the long term
[3055.68 → 3058.30] on some store, actually.
[3058.44 → 3059.16] It might be not
[3059.16 → 3060.40] on districtlines.com
[3060.40 → 3061.08] but somewhere else.
[3061.20 → 3061.64] More details.
[3061.70 → 3062.46] It'll be in the link
[3062.46 → 3063.44] of the description of the video
[3063.44 → 3064.50] that we tell you it's on.
[3064.60 → 3064.80] Yeah,
[3064.88 → 3065.58] it'll be somewhere.
[3066.00 → 3066.66] But for now,
[3066.74 → 3067.58] it's on Tee spring
[3067.58 → 3069.02] as a limited edition campaign.
[3069.28 → 3070.24] And the only difference
[3070.24 → 3071.10] between this one
[3071.10 → 3071.76] and the ones
[3071.76 → 3072.84] that'll be available later
[3072.84 → 3074.24] are that these
[3074.24 → 3076.00] as a nod
[3076.00 → 3077.96] to the people
[3077.96 → 3079.20] who love to be first
[3079.20 → 3081.00] say first on the back.
[3081.68 → 3082.82] We love you guys.
[3083.06 → 3083.74] Please don't comment
[3083.74 → 3084.50] on our videos.
[3085.08 → 3085.88] But we're still
[3085.88 → 3086.82] going to pander to you
[3086.82 → 3087.88] by releasing a shirt
[3087.88 → 3089.12] that says first
[3089.12 → 3090.06] on the back.
[3090.24 → 3090.82] Although if you comment
[3090.82 → 3091.28] on the video
[3091.28 → 3091.94] and say first
[3091.94 → 3092.52] and then link
[3092.52 → 3093.76] an image
[3093.76 → 3095.34] to you wearing the shirt
[3095.34 → 3096.44] with first on the back.
[3097.60 → 3098.00] Then
[3098.00 → 3099.76] we'll still hate you.
[3100.16 → 3100.76] But it'll be less.
[3100.76 → 3101.36] Not as much.
[3101.54 → 3101.74] Yeah.
[3102.16 → 3102.72] There you go.
[3103.32 → 3104.32] Slightly lower.
[3104.46 → 3105.20] It's never really
[3105.20 → 3106.10] bothered me that much.
[3106.20 → 3106.86] Like I've actually
[3106.86 → 3108.02] done it on my own videos.
[3108.40 → 3108.56] I've seen that.
[3108.56 → 3109.58] Before I said it live.
[3109.64 → 3110.26] I've seen that.
[3110.28 → 3110.80] I'll post first.
[3110.88 → 3111.48] I like that.
[3111.50 → 3112.90] Just because I'm
[3112.90 → 3114.20] kind of troll by nature.
[3115.66 → 3116.84] But the internet
[3116.84 → 3117.46] at large
[3117.46 → 3118.62] will definitely hate you
[3118.62 → 3120.08] for posting first
[3120.08 → 3120.78] with your first shirt.
[3120.98 → 3121.98] So there you go.
[3122.06 → 3123.18] Apparently 14 of them
[3123.18 → 3123.84] are gone already.
[3123.94 → 3124.90] How quickly did that happen?
[3124.98 → 3127.26] Everyone in chat
[3127.26 → 3127.90] is already
[3127.90 → 3128.98] saying first
[3128.98 → 3129.60] all over the place.
[3129.86 → 3130.28] Excellent.
[3130.80 → 3131.02] Alright,
[3131.16 → 3131.86] so there you go guys.
[3131.86 → 3133.12] We finally have
[3133.12 → 3134.22] Alina's Tech Tips shirt.
[3134.34 → 3135.04] They're on Tee spring
[3135.04 → 3136.02] so they'll be available
[3136.02 → 3137.04] sometime in the summer.
[3137.16 → 3138.18] You'll actually receive it.
[3138.38 → 3139.48] They've actually gotten faster
[3139.48 → 3140.56] in the time we've been using them.
[3140.84 → 3141.38] That's cool.
[3141.82 → 3142.78] Let's move on to
[3142.78 → 3143.58] more topics,
[3143.68 → 3144.06] shall we?
[3144.06 → 3145.96] More topics.
[3147.68 → 3148.44] What do we get?
[3148.58 → 3149.22] Oh, here we go.
[3149.58 → 3150.30] Ah, yes.
[3150.88 → 3152.74] More AMD news.
[3153.04 → 3154.18] Word on the street
[3154.18 → 3156.36] is that AMD's Fiji,
[3156.58 → 3158.18] so the rumoured 390X,
[3158.18 → 3158.74] What, Nick?
[3159.00 → 3160.28] will retail at...
[3160.28 → 3161.22] Why are you here?
[3161.32 → 3161.48] What?
[3161.48 → 3162.04] I thought you guys
[3162.04 → 3163.02] were still talking about shirts.
[3163.10 → 3163.68] I just wanted to say
[3163.68 → 3164.54] we have lots of different
[3164.54 → 3165.50] variations available
[3165.50 → 3166.56] including ladies' shirts.
[3166.64 → 3167.12] You should get them.
[3167.18 → 3167.70] Yeah, woo!
[3168.38 → 3169.10] We have ladies' shirts available?
[3169.10 → 3169.96] We do have ladies' shirts.
[3169.96 → 3171.02] We have a ladies' v-neck,
[3171.12 → 3171.98] a ladies' tank top,
[3172.02 → 3173.18] and a ladies' regular t-shirt.
[3173.20 → 3173.58] Oh, no way.
[3173.62 → 3174.42] I'm getting one for my wife.
[3174.60 → 3175.04] And then, like, frickin'
[3175.20 → 3176.74] a lot of just, like,
[3176.80 → 3177.84] men's or whatever.
[3177.92 → 3178.48] Oh, that's cool.
[3178.88 → 3179.74] When she doesn't wear it,
[3179.76 → 3180.36] I'm going to be, like,
[3180.52 → 3181.50] super sad.
[3181.86 → 3182.24] When what?
[3182.38 → 3183.90] When my wife doesn't wear it.
[3184.76 → 3185.58] I'm just going to be like...
[3185.58 → 3186.06] We should...
[3186.06 → 3187.14] Get her seven of them.
[3187.14 → 3187.82] We should all...
[3187.82 → 3188.82] She has to wear them every day.
[3188.84 → 3189.86] We should all get
[3189.86 → 3191.20] women's shirts
[3191.20 → 3192.22] for the respective ladies
[3192.22 → 3192.86] in our lives.
[3193.16 → 3193.34] Yeah.
[3193.38 → 3194.40] And then just, like,
[3194.44 → 3195.38] I'll get one for my mom.
[3195.46 → 3196.54] My mom will wear it,
[3196.60 → 3197.82] but, like, no one else will.
[3197.82 → 3199.50] And then when we don't see them wearing it,
[3199.52 → 3199.88] you should be like,
[3200.30 → 3201.08] Why not?
[3201.10 → 3201.98] Why don't you like my mom?
[3201.98 → 3203.52] Are you not proud of me?
[3204.78 → 3206.54] Why don't you wear the shirt?
[3206.80 → 3207.08] Sorry.
[3207.22 → 3207.68] Hi, chat.
[3207.80 → 3208.36] Thanks, guys.
[3209.40 → 3210.02] All right.
[3210.10 → 3212.50] So, this is from Fudzilla.com.
[3212.60 → 3215.94] Is it the single most reputable site
[3215.94 → 3216.68] on the internet?
[3216.86 → 3217.28] No.
[3217.78 → 3219.62] But Judo also gets it right
[3219.62 → 3221.10] a fair amount of...
[3221.10 → 3223.00] A fair amount of the time.
[3223.08 → 3223.26] Judo?
[3224.14 → 3224.78] Foo added.
[3224.88 → 3225.70] Judo's is a nickname.
[3225.92 → 3226.18] Okay.
[3226.36 → 3226.54] Yeah.
[3226.90 → 3227.14] Okay.
[3227.14 → 3227.78] Yeah.
[3227.96 → 3229.06] I didn't know his nickname was Judo.
[3229.20 → 3232.26] He is also jumping on my bandwagon
[3232.26 → 3233.60] about that other headline
[3233.60 → 3235.10] about the 4 gig limit.
[3235.40 → 3237.54] 4 gig first, 8 gig to follow, apparently.
[3237.54 → 3237.90] Oh, okay.
[3238.04 → 3240.26] I do know that 8 gigs is more complicated,
[3240.44 → 3241.14] and I do...
[3241.14 → 3242.74] I have heard rumours that
[3242.74 → 3245.80] the HBM chips' yields are not fantastic,
[3246.34 → 3247.62] so a high-capacity card
[3247.62 → 3249.12] might be prohibitively expensive.
[3249.46 → 3251.04] Not that NVIDIA minds releasing
[3251.04 → 3253.40] a graphics card for $1,000 anyway,
[3254.00 → 3254.14] but...
[3254.98 → 3255.66] Slightly more than that.
[3255.66 → 3258.10] AMD is being the value solution again
[3258.10 → 3259.60] and aiming, apparently,
[3259.98 → 3261.08] for around $850.
[3261.46 → 3263.00] Value solution, $850.
[3263.48 → 3265.40] Somewhere between the Titan X
[3265.40 → 3269.02] and the GeForce GTX 980.
[3269.26 → 3270.92] I don't know if we can call that
[3270.92 → 3271.72] the value solution.
[3272.22 → 3273.40] I don't know if I'm okay with that.
[3273.96 → 3275.66] With that said...
[3275.66 → 3276.64] That's really expensive
[3276.64 → 3277.82] for a value solution.
[3278.00 → 3279.00] There are rumours...
[3279.00 → 3281.18] Hey, saving $150
[3281.18 → 3282.88] is saving $150.
[3283.66 → 3285.52] Yeah, but it's a graphics card
[3285.52 → 3288.14] for, like, over $800.
[3288.74 → 3290.92] And it does only have 4 gigs of memory.
[3291.16 → 3291.46] Yeah.
[3291.50 → 3292.92] Compared to Titan X's 12.
[3293.88 → 3294.24] Huh.
[3294.80 → 3295.16] Okay.
[3295.40 → 3297.36] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3297.36 → 3298.92] Wait for the performance stuff.
[3299.14 → 3299.98] I just don't know if you can say
[3299.98 → 3300.68] it's a value card.
[3300.68 → 3302.58] We also really need to see
[3302.58 → 3304.00] what the counter is going to be
[3304.00 → 3305.02] from the green camp.
[3305.42 → 3306.94] Because there are a lot of rumours
[3306.94 → 3307.74] floating around
[3307.74 → 3310.30] about a GTX 980 Ti.
[3310.90 → 3312.72] A lot of rumours floating around.
[3312.84 → 3313.96] I've seen some rumours
[3313.96 → 3315.40] about that particular thing.
[3315.80 → 3318.02] But what we don't know anything about
[3318.02 → 3319.30] is pricing.
[3320.04 → 3323.64] So, if NVIDIA released a 980 Ti,
[3324.20 → 3325.50] would they price it
[3325.50 → 3328.68] more similarly to the GTX 980 now
[3328.68 → 3330.72] and drop the price of the 980
[3330.72 → 3333.16] really putting in the thumbscrews on AMD?
[3333.64 → 3334.04] Potentially.
[3334.22 → 3336.06] Unless the 390X crushes the Titan X.
[3336.24 → 3336.84] Which we don't know.
[3337.14 → 3337.92] Yeah, that's true.
[3338.04 → 3338.92] I think, honestly,
[3339.06 → 3340.20] they'll play very reactionary.
[3340.60 → 3341.78] If they need to, they'll drop it.
[3341.82 → 3342.48] They've done that before.
[3343.12 → 3344.30] If they don't need to,
[3344.40 → 3345.22] they won't drop it.
[3345.32 → 3346.14] They've done that before.
[3346.36 → 3347.46] Here's the funny thing, though.
[3347.58 → 3348.80] The funny thing is this.
[3349.58 → 3350.62] I guarantee you,
[3350.88 → 3352.48] AMD knows everything there is to know
[3352.48 → 3353.88] about the 980 Ti right now.
[3354.60 → 3356.66] And NVIDIA knows everything there is to know
[3356.66 → 3358.40] about the 390X right now.
[3358.68 → 3361.86] They probably even have cards.
[3362.66 → 3363.74] Like, straight up.
[3365.16 → 3368.20] So, whatever happens,
[3368.30 → 3369.46] it's just going to be like,
[3369.82 → 3372.38] it's like a game of cards
[3372.38 → 3374.38] where they just can both see each other's cards.
[3374.92 → 3375.22] So just,
[3375.50 → 3376.70] because you know how we've seen it
[3376.70 → 3377.50] time and time again
[3377.50 → 3378.54] in the last couple of years,
[3378.74 → 3380.18] where every card that launches
[3380.18 → 3381.96] slots in perfectly
[3381.96 → 3383.14] with the rest of the landscape.
[3383.14 → 3384.74] both of these cards
[3384.74 → 3386.26] are just going to make perfect sense
[3386.26 → 3387.52] depending on whether you have
[3387.52 → 3389.10] $850 to spend
[3389.10 → 3391.22] or however much a 980 Ti costs.
[3391.54 → 3392.92] I can't wait for you to do
[3392.92 → 3394.34] a value build log
[3394.34 → 3396.06] with an $850 graphics card.
[3396.32 → 3397.60] That would be awesome!
[3397.98 → 3399.32] You should just try to find
[3399.32 → 3401.64] the cheapest possible way
[3401.64 → 3403.06] to build all the rest of the computer
[3403.06 → 3404.36] and then keep it under a grand.
[3404.44 → 3404.96] No, dog.
[3405.24 → 3406.24] The intro!
[3406.82 → 3407.88] The intro for that...
[3407.88 → 3409.04] Like, Crab Yard Wars eBay,
[3409.30 → 3409.98] all the parts.
[3410.50 → 3411.06] Except for...
[3411.88 → 3414.24] Except for the graphics card.
[3414.60 → 3416.02] The intro for that video
[3416.02 → 3416.98] writes itself.
[3417.24 → 3417.96] Because remember,
[3418.12 → 3419.32] there was that whole headline
[3419.32 → 3420.62] with Lisa Su,
[3420.70 → 3421.40] AMD's CEO,
[3421.54 → 3422.60] saying they don't want to be known
[3422.60 → 3423.76] as the value solution.
[3423.76 → 3423.84] Again,
[3424.68 → 3427.24] an $850 graphics card,
[3427.40 → 3428.80] you guys keep releasing those,
[3428.96 → 3429.34] you're going to be
[3429.34 → 3430.82] the value solution forever.
[3433.96 → 3434.98] Oh my god,
[3435.02 → 3436.90] we could troll the crap out of them.
[3437.04 → 3437.82] That would be hilarious.
[3438.46 → 3439.66] Super awesome!
[3440.22 → 3441.54] That would be kind of a fun idea
[3441.54 → 3442.44] for a build, though.
[3443.46 → 3444.24] Put in, like,
[3444.32 → 3445.56] the cheapest stuff
[3445.56 → 3447.44] that will be able to actually run
[3447.44 → 3449.26] that graphics card,
[3449.40 → 3450.76] but with modern things.
[3451.74 → 3452.54] Let's see how it goes.
[3453.14 → 3453.54] Alright,
[3453.54 → 3454.82] so this is actually,
[3454.82 → 3457.52] this is actually going to be,
[3457.82 → 3459.72] this actually ties in pretty well.
[3460.12 → 3460.86] So we've got,
[3460.96 → 3462.26] we're going to do a Twitter blitz here.
[3462.82 → 3463.10] Alright?
[3463.74 → 3464.64] And this is always
[3464.64 → 3466.56] my favourite kind of question.
[3466.94 → 3467.96] Because it's the question
[3467.96 → 3469.26] where there is no answer,
[3469.62 → 3471.36] there's just speculation.
[3471.96 → 3473.68] So many people ask me this all the time.
[3473.98 → 3474.18] Like,
[3474.30 → 3476.10] what is going to be
[3476.10 → 3478.00] the graphics card to buy
[3478.00 → 3479.36] of the next generation?
[3479.36 → 3480.44] Because it looks like
[3480.44 → 3482.00] it's going to be 980Ti
[3482.00 → 3482.92] versus 390.
[3482.92 → 3483.88] 390X.
[3484.10 → 3485.32] And this is actually
[3485.32 → 3486.16] about,
[3486.64 → 3487.08] um,
[3487.80 → 3488.18] or wait,
[3488.38 → 3489.60] that doesn't really tie in that well.
[3490.34 → 3490.68] You know what?
[3490.74 → 3491.56] Let's do it anyway.
[3491.84 → 3492.78] So we're going to do it
[3492.78 → 3493.82] as a straw poll instead,
[3494.00 → 3495.20] since it's a fairly,
[3495.20 → 3496.20] I have no idea what's going to be.
[3496.20 → 3496.70] question to answer.
[3497.18 → 3497.40] So,
[3497.66 → 3498.50] GTX,
[3499.02 → 3500.40] 780Ti
[3500.40 → 3501.10] versus
[3501.10 → 3502.42] R9,
[3502.54 → 3503.20] 390X.
[3503.22 → 3504.56] And I'm just even speculating.
[3505.06 → 3505.46] Yes,
[3505.86 → 3506.34] no,
[3506.78 → 3507.28] and,
[3507.38 → 3508.26] What is yes and no
[3508.26 → 3508.88] to this question?
[3509.04 → 3509.26] Oh,
[3509.36 → 3509.54] right.
[3509.64 → 3510.46] Those aren't really very,
[3510.52 → 3510.74] okay,
[3510.84 → 3511.22] I'm sorry.
[3511.38 → 3511.96] GTX,
[3512.36 → 3512.88] GTX,
[3512.88 → 3515.42] It's like,
[3515.48 → 3516.10] what the heck?
[3516.36 → 3517.58] Is that 780Ti?
[3517.90 → 3518.12] Yeah,
[3518.24 → 3518.58] oh,
[3518.70 → 3519.08] crap.
[3519.32 → 3520.36] So is the title.
[3521.04 → 3521.86] What are you doing?
[3521.96 → 3523.12] What am I even doing?
[3523.84 → 3525.60] Why is the 780Ti
[3525.60 → 3526.66] the only card
[3526.66 → 3527.32] that exists
[3527.32 → 3528.22] in my mind?
[3528.48 → 3529.10] Because they're
[3529.10 → 3529.78] nerfing it.
[3530.20 → 3530.62] Are they?
[3530.76 → 3531.06] What?
[3531.50 → 3532.30] What are you talking about?
[3532.30 → 3534.08] They nerfed it.
[3534.08 → 3534.22] What?
[3534.70 → 3535.62] There's people talking about
[3535.62 → 3537.46] new NVIDIA driver revisions.
[3537.58 → 3538.10] I don't know how this
[3538.10 → 3538.96] didn't end up in the doc,
[3539.18 → 3540.38] but apparently new NVIDIA
[3540.38 → 3541.24] driver revisions
[3541.24 → 3542.94] are making the 780Ti
[3542.94 → 3543.78] a little bit worse.
[3544.64 → 3545.16] 780Ti?
[3545.30 → 3545.56] Yeah.
[3546.04 → 3546.28] Really?
[3546.34 → 3547.32] Because I heard about them,
[3547.50 → 3548.84] I haven't looked into it enough
[3548.84 → 3549.80] to talk about it in depth,
[3549.88 → 3550.68] but I heard about them
[3550.68 → 3552.54] possibly nerfing
[3552.54 → 3553.60] the overclocking
[3553.60 → 3554.54] on the 970M
[3554.54 → 3555.42] and 980Ms again.
[3556.02 → 3556.42] Interesting.
[3556.70 → 3556.84] No,
[3556.86 → 3558.06] this is desktop card stuff,
[3558.16 → 3558.30] though.
[3559.30 → 3560.64] I haven't had time
[3560.64 → 3561.08] to try it.
[3561.12 → 3561.98] I do kind of want
[3561.98 → 3562.54] to check it out.
[3564.14 → 3565.04] How fascinating.
[3565.40 → 3566.34] It could also just be fixed
[3566.34 → 3567.32] in the very next driver.
[3567.60 → 3567.88] Right.
[3568.78 → 3569.78] It's also possible.
[3570.30 → 3571.46] I am trying to post
[3571.46 → 3572.08] the straw poll.
[3572.26 → 3573.44] I do not straight up
[3573.44 → 3574.74] remember my Twitch password,
[3575.06 → 3576.90] so that is very challenging
[3576.90 → 3577.98] for me at this time.
[3578.06 → 3578.80] I'm a challenged
[3578.80 → 3579.58] sort of person,
[3579.58 → 3581.82] and it doesn't really help
[3581.82 → 3582.88] when the chat loads
[3582.88 → 3583.80] phenomenally slowly.
[3583.94 → 3584.66] Here we go.
[3585.14 → 3585.78] Ba-door-boop!
[3586.46 → 3587.42] There's our straw poll.
[3587.48 → 3588.08] Ba-due-bum.
[3589.58 → 3590.58] Oh, wait,
[3590.66 → 3591.56] where'd my link to it go?
[3591.56 → 3592.22] There it is.
[3592.44 → 3593.06] This is what happens
[3593.06 → 3593.52] when you have,
[3593.56 → 3594.38] oh, that's not it,
[3594.48 → 3595.06] when you have like
[3595.06 → 3596.40] 300 bazillion tabs.
[3596.60 → 3597.78] So let's see the results
[3597.78 → 3598.88] as they roll in,
[3598.92 → 3599.32] and let's move on
[3599.32 → 3600.06] into our next topic.
[3600.12 → 3600.44] What do we get?
[3600.44 → 3600.64] What?
[3601.12 → 3601.68] What?
[3601.68 → 3601.84] What?
[3601.84 → 3601.88] What?
[3601.88 → 3602.18] What?
[3602.18 → 3602.38] What?
[3602.38 → 3602.78] What?
[3602.78 → 3602.88] What?
[3602.88 → 3602.98] What?
[3602.98 → 3603.08] What?
[3603.08 → 3603.18] What?
[3603.18 → 3603.40] What?
[3603.40 → 3603.78] What?
[3603.78 → 3604.00] What?
[3604.00 → 3604.10] What?
[3604.10 → 3604.20] What?
[3604.20 → 3604.28] What?
[3604.28 → 3604.40] What?
[3604.40 → 3604.70] What?
[3604.70 → 3616.54] 2% of you
[3616.54 → 3616.94] have to Cum
[3616.94 → 3617.86] to Cum
[3617.86 → 3618.84] where the
[3618.84 → 3619.28] YouTube launches
[3619.28 → 3620.52] 60 FPS live-streaming
[3620.52 → 3621.82] in quest to take on
[3621.82 → 3622.56] Twitch.
[3622.82 → 3623.30] This was posted
[3623.30 → 3624.24] on The Purge.
[3624.24 → 3628.00] It was posted on the forum by Tantra.
[3628.54 → 3630.72] You know what the funny thing about these straw polls is?
[3630.94 → 3631.08] What?
[3631.18 → 3634.36] Is it just straight up doesn't matter how long we look at the results.
[3634.70 → 3637.96] After the first, like, ten seconds, the proportion never changes.
[3638.18 → 3638.34] Yeah.
[3639.02 → 3642.38] It's like, how big of a sample size is enough?
[3643.28 → 3644.92] Apparently the first ten seconds.
[3645.32 → 3646.56] Because it's, like, done.
[3647.40 → 3650.94] Let's see if we can even change it if we want to.
[3651.16 → 3653.68] Guys, if you haven't voted, get in there.
[3653.98 → 3654.62] Turnip power.
[3654.96 → 3655.48] Come on.
[3655.66 → 3656.46] Vote for turnip.
[3656.54 → 3657.44] Vote for turnip.
[3657.52 → 3658.74] Hashtag vote for turnip.
[3658.94 → 3659.32] Yes.
[3659.58 → 3664.92] We've got to bring the turnip in line with the 980 Ti or beat it.
[3665.04 → 3665.30] Okay?
[3665.98 → 3666.88] Come on, turnip.
[3667.20 → 3668.16] And I've enabled.
[3668.36 → 3670.06] Actually, this is news we didn't even.
[3670.22 → 3672.74] Okay, so I'm going to put away the straw poll so you guys can't see if it's working.
[3672.86 → 3673.86] Look how beautiful that is.
[3674.36 → 3675.76] How could you not vote for that?
[3675.76 → 3677.18] There's a new feature on Twitch.
[3677.50 → 3683.44] So before we get into YouTube 60fps streaming, Twitch has a new feature that has shortened
[3683.44 → 3684.44] the delay.
[3684.80 → 3689.38] Remember back when they changed their server configuration so that there was that massive,
[3689.38 → 3691.76] up to over a minute delay between stream and chat?
[3692.20 → 3698.32] Now there is a beta feature that you can go ahead and enable within your dashboard in
[3698.32 → 3699.00] order to...
[3699.00 → 3700.44] Sorry, I can't keep a straight face.
[3700.84 → 3703.20] Turnip is beating 390X.
[3703.20 → 3704.38] Turnip power, man.
[3704.38 → 3705.38] Turnip power.
[3705.38 → 3705.74] Yes!
[3706.88 → 3707.62] Come on.
[3708.10 → 3710.46] So is this how politicians win elections?
[3710.46 → 3710.54] Two more percent.
[3710.88 → 3713.44] It's just if we tell them hard enough to vote for it, they'll be...
[3713.44 → 3713.86] Yes!
[3714.00 → 3714.26] Turnip power!
[3714.26 → 3714.62] Yes!
[3714.62 → 3715.16] Turnip power!
[3715.68 → 3715.92] Yes!
[3717.38 → 3719.40] This is what campaigning is all about.
[3719.64 → 3720.12] That's right.
[3720.42 → 3722.64] That's why going door-to-door works, kids.
[3722.64 → 3723.64] Turnip power.
[3723.64 → 3723.68] Yeah.
[3723.68 → 3727.74] For turnip, we should just go door-to-door and leave turnips on the doorsteps.
[3728.24 → 3730.94] With like a little toothpick in it, a little sign, vote for turnip.
[3731.40 → 3732.74] Next time there's a local election.
[3732.96 → 3737.72] Vermin Supreme just goes around and leaves boots with little turnips on the top on everyone's
[3737.72 → 3737.92] door.
[3738.40 → 3738.68] Awesome.
[3738.68 → 3739.78] How many people will get that reference?
[3739.92 → 3744.58] So Twitch has a new feature that allows us to interact with you guys more closely.
[3744.98 → 3747.64] Does it bring it back to the way it was before?
[3747.64 → 3748.08] No.
[3749.52 → 3754.00] But I think it's able to shorten it up to like 15 to 20 seconds or something like that.
[3754.08 → 3755.62] Like definitely a significant difference.
[3755.82 → 3756.00] Yeah.
[3756.38 → 3756.60] Yeah.
[3756.72 → 3757.42] It's a lot better.
[3757.56 → 3758.78] So very, very good news.
[3758.92 → 3763.12] It's better to the point where you're not waiting like two minutes for a response because
[3763.12 → 3766.44] you type it in, and it takes so long for him to see it, and then he says that it takes
[3766.44 → 3768.54] so long for you to see it, and it's just ridiculous.
[3769.20 → 3769.56] All right.
[3769.60 → 3771.36] So the original article here is from The Verge.
[3771.42 → 3772.90] Let's go ahead and fire that up.
[3774.34 → 3775.02] Ba-door-boop.
[3775.54 → 3776.14] Ba-due-bum.
[3777.64 → 3778.52] Ba-due-bum.
[3778.86 → 3779.92] So what is there to really...
[3779.92 → 3780.26] Oh no.
[3780.56 → 3781.62] I just closed the dock.
[3781.66 → 3782.22] Way to go.
[3782.34 → 3782.92] I'll be there in a moment.
[3783.12 → 3788.16] There isn't a ton to specifically say other than the title, but it is interesting that YouTube
[3788.16 → 3789.36] is trying this hard.
[3789.50 → 3790.48] There's been a huge...
[3790.48 → 3794.80] We've talked about this a little bit in previous shows, but there's been a huge push
[3794.80 → 3796.76] for online video in general.
[3797.62 → 3802.18] Streaming especially I'd actually say with Azure getting tons of funding lately.
[3802.50 → 3802.58] Yeah.
[3802.78 → 3805.30] Twitch continuing to completely explode.
[3805.30 → 3808.30] Twitch just being absolutely insane.
[3808.50 → 3810.86] Acquired by Amazon and not exactly a small deal.
[3811.26 → 3817.10] Google trying to kind of start a fight which looks a lot more interesting than Azure's so
[3817.10 → 3819.70] far not super successful push but anyway.
[3819.70 → 3821.58] The thing about YouTube is that...
[3821.58 → 3827.32] And there's something that they have to overcome here is that Google finally woke up to the
[3827.32 → 3829.62] fact that gaming content is popular on YouTube.
[3829.62 → 3829.80] Yeah.
[3830.40 → 3833.90] And has decided to actually give two craps about it at all.
[3834.26 → 3834.40] Yeah.
[3834.40 → 3836.14] So it took them so long.
[3836.22 → 3838.78] There was never any reason for Twitch to be allowed to exist.
[3839.48 → 3846.54] YouTube could have easily supported these features before and maybe Twitch would have never been
[3846.54 → 3852.16] able to spring up out of completely the woodwork and just completely dominate online
[3852.16 → 3852.74] game streaming.
[3852.74 → 3860.36] But the good news for YouTube is that Twitch is not interested right now in being a video
[3860.36 → 3861.04] repository.
[3861.84 → 3861.96] Yeah.
[3861.96 → 3867.90] So gamers have had to kind of support both platforms because if you want to archive anything
[3867.90 → 3872.70] and have it be actually discoverable on you know what is it the second-largest search
[3872.70 → 3877.28] engine or whatever that thing everyone likes to say is second-largest search engine in the
[3877.28 → 3877.58] world.
[3877.74 → 3878.92] They want to be discoverable.
[3878.92 → 3882.16] They have to support YouTube even if their followings aren't as big over there.
[3882.36 → 3886.12] And if they want to live stream Twitch has been the only way to do it because that's
[3886.12 → 3891.54] where you get the actual support for things like third party streaming software like Split
[3891.54 → 3892.32] which we love.
[3892.86 → 3898.24] Or if you want to say for example stream at 60 FPS which people love or stream at resolutions
[3898.24 → 3899.90] other than 1080p which people love.
[3900.32 → 3902.74] So you have to support these two platforms.
[3903.28 → 3908.90] So guys like us who are heavily invested in YouTube actually have a pretty decent job.
[3908.92 → 3914.04] presence on Twitch if the push ever came to shove, and we wanted to start investing in
[3914.04 → 3914.68] Twitch more heavily.
[3915.16 → 3921.46] And many Twitch streamers maybe they don't have you know 1.3 million subscribers on YouTube
[3921.46 → 3922.68] or whatever the number is.
[3922.74 → 3928.06] Maybe they've got 800 or 80,000 or 150,000 or something like that compared to a massive following
[3928.06 → 3928.48] on Twitch.
[3928.56 → 3931.04] Well hey that's not insignificant either.
[3931.04 → 3938.64] A huge part of building a channel is that first 20 or 30 or 50,000 you work so much harder
[3938.64 → 3944.32] for the first 100,000 subscribers than you do for a subsequent 250,000.
[3944.66 → 3945.76] That's the way it works.
[3946.08 → 3947.60] Once you gain critical mass.
[3947.66 → 3952.00] I mean if you were never going to hit 100,000 subscribers then like none of this is applicable.
[3952.16 → 3955.52] But if you were going to get big you work so much harder for it at the beginning.
[3955.52 → 3958.88] Um so you know very interesting.
[3959.28 → 3963.02] I don't necessarily see it changing immediately.
[3963.54 → 3967.06] Yeah I really wonder how this is going to go because Twitch has such a good relationship
[3967.06 → 3968.20] with all the game streamers.
[3968.30 → 3971.72] They bring them out to shows like the Twitch booths that shows are insane.
[3972.00 → 3972.08] Yeah.
[3972.16 → 3974.78] They directly support them in so many different ways.
[3975.04 → 3975.06] Yeah.
[3975.22 → 3979.80] And they're just so like the connections and networking that Twitch has is so incredibly strong.
[3979.80 → 3986.52] And at least in our experience the whole networking and connections and support side from Google
[3986.52 → 3989.26] is really not great.
[3989.48 → 3990.82] Google's an engineering company.
[3991.10 → 3991.28] Yes.
[3991.50 → 3998.46] And Twitch seems to be they seem to have a much better feel for what it means to be a relationship company.
[3998.54 → 4001.96] And there's fascinating things on Twitch which is going to keep streamers there like
[4001.96 → 4005.16] uh openly being able to do donate stuff with no problems.
[4005.24 → 4006.64] You're able to do contests.
[4006.64 → 4012.14] It's not really able to do but happens all the time everywhere and kind of everyone ignores it.
[4012.56 → 4012.66] Yeah.
[4012.66 → 4015.36] Um there's subscribe buttons which helps people a ton.
[4015.46 → 4018.40] You can get icons if you subscribe which helps people a ton.
[4018.40 → 4022.26] With that said some of these features exist or will exist on YouTube as well.
[4022.90 → 4028.90] And YouTube's um like kind of pay pass you know some kind of premium paid option feature
[4028.90 → 4030.58] that's been rumoured forever.
[4030.58 → 4031.24] Oh I don't know that one.
[4031.32 → 4035.08] I don't I don't know like yeah like uh like more like what Vessel's doing.
[4035.08 → 4036.32] I thought you were talking about the tip jar.
[4036.32 → 4036.64] I got it.
[4036.64 → 4037.30] No not that one.
[4037.30 → 4037.46] Yeah.
[4037.46 → 4041.50] More like what Vessel's doing where there's a paid YouTube and you just don't see any ads.
[4041.50 → 4047.38] Um that's been rumoured for a long time and that could come along and put a lot of money in streamers pockets.
[4047.88 → 4053.08] If you know they're rolling ads at will and people who are paying a monthly subscription
[4053.08 → 4056.12] and like only watching that streamer are effectively giving them a few bucks.
[4056.12 → 4059.40] And the volume could be potentially much higher.
[4059.50 → 4064.02] I mean YouTube is a huge audience as PewDiePie can certainly attest to.
[4064.54 → 4071.90] I wonder if um I wonder if there's some form of exclusivity agreement in the Twitch contract
[4071.90 → 4078.22] because it would be interesting if you just streamed uh to both.
[4078.22 → 4080.18] Which is possible.
[4081.18 → 4081.66] Yeah.
[4081.94 → 4083.42] It's not impossible that's for sure.
[4083.84 → 4084.28] It would be.
[4084.32 → 4085.00] Need more upload.
[4085.18 → 4086.20] Not super easy.
[4086.84 → 4088.20] But it would definitely be possible.
[4088.20 → 4089.32] You could stream to both.
[4089.50 → 4089.64] Yeah.
[4090.00 → 4091.70] I mean you'll always have to have a primary.
[4092.06 → 4096.20] And that's something that we've discovered is that when we say don't forget to subscribe
[4096.20 → 4098.48] only YouTube has subscribed.
[4099.46 → 4099.98] I say follow.
[4100.52 → 4100.72] Yeah.
[4100.82 → 4102.34] And I've started saying follow too.
[4102.54 → 4104.76] But there are a lot of other things too like click the annotation.
[4105.48 → 4107.30] Other video platforms don't support annotations.
[4107.30 → 4110.08] So if we started uploading on Billy for example.
[4110.08 → 4114.58] Yeah but if it's a stream you can address that much more easily.
[4114.88 → 4115.30] Sort of.
[4115.32 → 4116.92] And like you can mix your chats and stuff.
[4116.98 → 4117.18] Okay.
[4117.34 → 4119.38] Something a lot of streamers do is subscriber only chat.
[4120.38 → 4124.48] So are they just going to ignore the YouTube chat and just talk to their Twitch chat?
[4124.80 → 4125.40] I don't know.
[4125.66 → 4126.26] That's interesting.
[4126.40 → 4126.44] Yeah.
[4126.44 → 4129.24] Because there will be a lot of spam in that YouTube chat unless there's a subscriber
[4129.24 → 4129.62] only mode.
[4129.68 → 4129.92] And then what?
[4129.98 → 4131.16] Are you going to ask for subscribers on both?
[4131.20 → 4132.32] Are you going to monitor two chat windows?
[4132.40 → 4132.74] Come on.
[4133.42 → 4134.06] That's tough.
[4134.66 → 4136.86] There will definitely be.
[4136.86 → 4137.84] There are all you guys who do it.
[4138.06 → 4139.88] Browser hook which mixes those chats.
[4140.52 → 4143.70] And then that's a total mess because then they can't see each other.
[4144.64 → 4146.86] Not that anyone can really talk to each other in a half way.
[4146.86 → 4148.28] No I mean for the streamer.
[4148.64 → 4149.50] Oh for the streamer.
[4149.50 → 4150.50] So the streamer can monitor everything.
[4150.80 → 4151.02] Yeah.
[4151.26 → 4152.12] But I don't know.
[4152.18 → 4154.32] It's just it will fragment it for sure.
[4154.40 → 4154.50] Yeah.
[4154.64 → 4154.74] Yeah.
[4154.88 → 4155.96] The degree to which it does it?
[4156.04 → 4156.44] I don't know.
[4157.06 → 4158.40] But it will fragment it for sure.
[4158.40 → 4159.40] Okay.
[4159.40 → 4160.40] Yeah.
[4160.40 → 4161.40] Okay.
[4161.40 → 4162.00] Okay.
[4162.00 → 4162.32] Okay.
[4162.32 → 4164.82] So let me have.
[4164.82 → 4165.50] You know what?
[4165.96 → 4167.72] This is our next Twitter Blitz.
[4167.82 → 4172.06] And this is actually from Lenovo has their upcoming Tech World event.
[4172.06 → 4175.96] And there are a couple of hashtags that we want you guys to use in it.
[4176.08 → 4177.74] So we haven't done a Twitter Blitz in a while.
[4177.96 → 4181.16] And this one is pretty much open-ended.
[4181.54 → 4184.76] So we're supposed to talk about what we think is next.
[4185.18 → 4187.26] And it's for the upcoming Tech World event.
[4187.26 → 4193.06] So I'm assuming if I were to talk about houseplants that have genes injected into them
[4193.06 → 4194.04] that make them glow.
[4194.96 → 4196.40] Well I guess that's kind of tech, isn't it?
[4196.52 → 4196.62] Yeah.
[4196.68 → 4196.86] Okay.
[4196.92 → 4198.70] But let's talk computer tech.
[4198.98 → 4202.52] So I want you guys to post about what you think is next.
[4202.68 → 4203.86] At Linus Tech on Twitter.
[4204.20 → 4205.80] Use these two hashtags.
[4206.48 → 4206.88] Book.
[4207.26 → 4208.52] At Linus Tech on Twitter.
[4208.64 → 4209.40] And we're going to go ahead.
[4209.48 → 4213.76] We're going to blitz through you guys in the next little while here.
[4214.76 → 4216.04] And it can be vague.
[4216.12 → 4217.18] So do you want me to go first?
[4217.82 → 4218.14] Sure.
[4218.44 → 4218.62] Okay.
[4219.02 → 4220.82] So for me what's next?
[4220.92 → 4224.36] Whether I like it or not is wires are going away.
[4225.06 → 4232.32] That is something that is kind of like I've been kind of inching towards this for a while.
[4232.32 → 4235.66] You look at Intel's what is it?
[4235.96 → 4238.78] 50 gigahertz or whatever that stupid.
[4239.42 → 4241.02] What's the 58 gigahertz?
[4241.16 → 4242.38] I don't remember exactly what it is.
[4242.86 → 4246.04] The very short range Wi-Fi.
[4246.04 → 4248.02] Or the very short range wireless.
[4248.48 → 4249.60] Someone's going to correct me.
[4253.60 → 4256.92] Short range wireless high speed.
[4257.04 → 4259.12] I think it was like gigabit speeds or something.
[4259.18 → 4260.48] Something ridiculous like that.
[4260.88 → 4261.12] High.
[4261.38 → 4262.10] The Y gig.
[4262.10 → 4263.20] 60 gigahertz.
[4263.20 → 4263.94] There we go.
[4264.74 → 4269.12] So seeing technology like that demoed and actually working.
[4269.74 → 4271.34] Seeing companies like Apple.
[4271.54 → 4275.32] So the MacBook 2015 was the thing that kind of feels like wow.
[4275.32 → 4277.76] Someone's already doing this.
[4277.76 → 4279.60] So when you go on Apple.com.
[4281.16 → 4283.76] They've got the iPhone.
[4284.14 → 4284.82] The iPad.
[4285.60 → 4287.44] They've got the MacBook.
[4288.30 → 4290.98] And they've got the watch.
[4291.24 → 4292.60] They've got the Apple Watch.
[4292.96 → 4294.46] And they've got them all arranged.
[4295.14 → 4296.02] In like.
[4296.28 → 4297.64] I can't find the page right now.
[4297.64 → 4299.68] But they've got them all arranged.
[4299.86 → 4301.22] And it just says better together.
[4301.90 → 4303.72] And what struck me about those products.
[4303.94 → 4308.22] Is that none of them encourage external connectivity.
[4308.72 → 4311.28] They all encourage cloud-based storage.
[4311.78 → 4312.84] They all encourage.
[4313.20 → 4316.24] And cloud-based backup for things like photos.
[4316.48 → 4319.32] They all encourage sync between the devices.
[4319.52 → 4320.62] Without thinking about it.
[4320.68 → 4321.84] Without plugging anything in.
[4321.84 → 4323.08] And you know.
[4323.42 → 4324.52] Whether you're one of those people.
[4324.68 → 4325.40] Who believes Apple.
[4325.52 → 4326.02] When they say.
[4326.52 → 4327.40] DSLR like.
[4327.92 → 4328.74] Photo quality.
[4329.20 → 4330.50] Or whether you're one of those people.
[4330.62 → 4330.96] Who's like.
[4331.10 → 4331.64] Uh no.
[4331.80 → 4333.26] I'm still going to need a USB cable.
[4333.36 → 4333.96] And a card reader.
[4334.06 → 4336.34] To transfer photos off my real freaking camera.
[4336.78 → 4337.72] Whoever you are.
[4338.20 → 4340.78] Apple is trying to push that future forward today.
[4341.18 → 4342.54] And if they're trying to do it.
[4342.82 → 4344.26] Then someone's going to come along.
[4344.40 → 4345.56] And take that concept.
[4345.86 → 4346.46] And clone it.
[4346.64 → 4347.34] And do it better.
[4347.38 → 4349.00] Once the technology catches up a little bit.
[4349.08 → 4350.42] And that future I think is coming.
[4350.80 → 4351.60] Wireless charging.
[4351.84 → 4352.76] Wireless data.
[4353.38 → 4353.74] And.
[4354.86 → 4357.34] The camera that I'm borrowing right now.
[4357.54 → 4359.86] Can transfer pictures to my phone over NFC.
[4360.94 → 4361.62] That's cool.
[4361.96 → 4362.16] Yeah.
[4362.52 → 4363.28] So there you go.
[4363.66 → 4363.92] Still.
[4364.04 → 4364.62] So there you go.
[4365.00 → 4365.50] That's what.
[4365.60 → 4366.96] That's what I think is.
[4367.08 → 4367.74] What's next.
[4367.96 → 4369.22] Is wires are just.
[4369.38 → 4370.06] Going to be gone.
[4370.72 → 4371.40] Completely gone.
[4372.24 → 4372.98] I think.
[4374.58 → 4375.14] Personally.
[4375.28 → 4377.06] Solar power is going to be a much bigger thing.
[4377.88 → 4379.08] The efficiency.
[4379.66 → 4380.14] Of.
[4380.14 → 4381.92] The panels themselves.
[4381.92 → 4383.90] And the efficiency of storage mechanisms.
[4383.90 → 4384.92] Have massively.
[4385.32 → 4385.68] Massively.
[4385.84 → 4386.84] Increased over the last little while.
[4386.96 → 4388.16] The home battery is a big deal.
[4388.16 → 4388.36] Hey.
[4388.56 → 4388.80] Yeah.
[4388.96 → 4389.20] Yeah.
[4389.62 → 4391.38] There's a study that just came out of MIT.
[4391.76 → 4394.36] Talking about how we need to focus on it much more.
[4394.36 → 4394.80] Because.
[4395.14 → 4397.00] There's just so much available power.
[4397.36 → 4398.30] It's not even like.
[4398.40 → 4398.64] Oh.
[4398.78 → 4399.12] Well.
[4399.44 → 4401.08] It's better for the planet.
[4401.46 → 4401.48] Or.
[4401.68 → 4402.02] Deep.
[4402.08 → 4402.44] Deep.
[4402.44 → 4402.94] It's just like.
[4403.00 → 4403.24] No.
[4403.60 → 4404.82] There's a lot of it.
[4404.96 → 4406.00] And it's super available.
[4406.18 → 4406.96] And it's sitting right there.
[4407.02 → 4409.02] And it's really not hard to take advantage of.
[4409.64 → 4411.32] And it's literally there.
[4411.40 → 4412.12] Whether we like it or not.
[4412.18 → 4412.48] Yeah.
[4412.64 → 4412.88] Like.
[4412.96 → 4413.94] It's super easy.
[4413.94 → 4416.28] Unless Mr. Burns builds a sun blocker.
[4416.46 → 4417.84] We're kind of stuck with the sun.
[4417.92 → 4418.18] Yeah.
[4418.40 → 4418.58] Yeah.
[4419.44 → 4420.06] So yeah.
[4420.66 → 4420.96] All right.
[4421.00 → 4422.34] So let's have a look at what you guys think.
[4422.44 → 4424.04] We never do Twitter blitzes anymore.
[4424.22 → 4424.66] To you which.
[4424.78 → 4425.34] I wanted to.
[4425.52 → 4426.24] One of the.
[4426.84 → 4428.64] I should talk to you about.
[4429.08 → 4430.00] Prospective projects.
[4430.14 → 4430.90] Not on the land show.
[4431.14 → 4431.34] Oh.
[4431.46 → 4431.66] Okay.
[4432.20 → 4434.22] Amy says the 6S.
[4434.74 → 4435.08] Gotcha.
[4435.66 → 4436.06] Okay.
[4436.94 → 4437.72] No idea.
[4437.72 → 4438.74] But it better be shiny.
[4439.58 → 4441.46] GPUs coming from the manufacturer.
[4441.84 → 4443.06] With water cooling.
[4443.22 → 4445.12] Being more common than ones with air cooling.
[4445.48 → 4446.80] That is an out there prediction.
[4447.32 → 4448.56] That is a very out there prediction.
[4448.58 → 4451.50] I think that will probably never happen.
[4452.02 → 4456.26] I think water cooled out of the box is going to be not a thing for a while.
[4456.62 → 4459.00] Kevin Hall says virtual reality contact lenses.
[4459.36 → 4461.76] Dear Lord would I ever love for that to be next.
[4461.84 → 4462.94] I don't think that's next.
[4463.22 → 4463.56] That's.
[4463.94 → 4465.98] And it's hopefully augmented reality.
[4466.16 → 4467.72] Because VR contact lenses.
[4467.82 → 4468.86] How do I take them out?
[4469.76 → 4470.76] When I want to see.
[4471.22 → 4471.48] Well.
[4471.62 → 4472.94] It's like I want to eat my food.
[4473.38 → 4473.74] Yeah.
[4474.02 → 4476.74] You're going to have a camera somewhere for augmented reality.
[4477.20 → 4477.56] No.
[4477.56 → 4478.56] Because if you can see through them.
[4478.56 → 4479.06] Augmented reality would be fine.
[4479.06 → 4480.46] So if you can see through them.
[4480.68 → 4482.04] Then augmented reality is fine.
[4482.52 → 4484.48] And if they were VR you couldn't see through them.
[4484.54 → 4484.68] Yeah.
[4484.98 → 4485.30] So.
[4485.60 → 4487.64] You'd have to like to wear a head mounted camera then.
[4487.86 → 4489.36] And that'd have to like to connect to them.
[4489.58 → 4490.58] Mind you if there are no wires.
[4491.50 → 4492.32] And if I'm right.
[4492.48 → 4493.50] And no wires is next.
[4493.60 → 4494.38] Then this will be later.
[4494.54 → 4495.24] And there won't be any wires.
[4495.24 → 4496.30] But then that doesn't mean it's next.
[4496.64 → 4497.44] That doesn't mean it's next.
[4497.44 → 4497.92] Um.
[4498.12 → 4499.90] Although did you hear about the uh.
[4500.10 → 4500.56] Bionic.
[4500.56 → 4500.96] Uh.
[4501.02 → 4501.66] Bionic lenses.
[4502.60 → 4502.92] Yeah.
[4503.26 → 4503.38] Yeah.
[4503.38 → 4503.50] Yeah.
[4503.50 → 4503.98] Yeah.
[4503.98 → 4505.88] So that's some pretty freaking cool stuff.
[4505.94 → 4507.68] I don't have an article to show you guys or anything.
[4507.68 → 4511.28] But my wife and I were talking about apparently in the next two to three years.
[4511.68 → 4516.94] Bionic lenses are coming with all the advantages and none of the drawbacks of surgeries like LAST.
[4517.46 → 4518.20] So uh.
[4518.48 → 4518.88] Wow.
[4519.68 → 4520.08] Um.
[4520.34 → 4520.72] Yeah.
[4521.02 → 4522.70] Like they don't degrade over time.
[4522.78 → 4523.84] You're not going to need glasses later.
[4523.84 → 4526.26] So I should just still not buy glasses.
[4526.54 → 4526.70] No.
[4526.76 → 4527.88] You should still get glasses.
[4528.00 → 4528.54] He wants me.
[4528.62 → 4530.16] But it's coming in like two or three years.
[4530.22 → 4532.40] He wants me to buy him a bigger Teleprompter.
[4533.30 → 4534.78] So that he doesn't have to buy.
[4534.92 → 4536.52] We should have a bigger Teleprompter anyway.
[4536.60 → 4537.76] So that he doesn't have to buy glasses.
[4537.96 → 4538.28] No.
[4538.44 → 4539.82] We should have a bigger Teleprompter anyway.
[4540.08 → 4540.32] Okay.
[4540.54 → 4540.58] So.
[4540.78 → 4542.04] Teleprompter is crap.
[4542.80 → 4544.02] Even today filming it.
[4544.06 → 4544.92] It's like the the the the the.
[4544.98 → 4546.84] The text on the screen is jumping all over the place.
[4546.84 → 4548.00] That's the best app.
[4548.48 → 4549.60] You should see the other ones.
[4549.62 → 4550.80] So get something that isn't based on an app.
[4550.82 → 4552.14] You should see the other ones.
[4552.36 → 4553.34] Oh I believe it.
[4553.42 → 4555.00] But get something that's not based on an app.
[4555.12 → 4555.32] Alright.
[4555.44 → 4557.56] Next is another interesting VR presentation.
[4557.86 → 4558.06] Yeah.
[4558.14 → 4558.38] Okay.
[4558.52 → 4559.64] Most likely VR movies.
[4559.80 → 4561.36] That is not next.
[4561.70 → 4562.56] But I do hope.
[4562.60 → 4564.08] I mean I think they're kind of called video games.
[4564.50 → 4566.42] Because to shoot a movie in VR.
[4567.26 → 4568.66] And like have it be.
[4568.74 → 4572.14] Like how would you even get a camera rig that records in all directions.
[4572.26 → 4572.74] So people can.
[4572.74 → 4573.92] I think they're already working on that stuff.
[4573.96 → 4574.18] Yeah.
[4574.18 → 4576.06] Like they have 360 degree.
[4576.06 → 4576.78] They already have the camera rig.
[4576.84 → 4576.96] Yeah.
[4577.04 → 4577.78] They have that.
[4577.90 → 4580.32] But how could you shoot it in a way that.
[4582.16 → 4584.70] Like I think it would actually detract.
[4584.90 → 4585.18] I'm too sure.
[4585.18 → 4587.82] From the movie watching experience in certain ways.
[4588.14 → 4589.48] Like there's probably been a tech demo.
[4589.50 → 4591.98] It will be a totally different style.
[4592.26 → 4593.56] Like super different style.
[4593.68 → 4594.24] That's one thing to me.
[4594.24 → 4597.34] Part of the movie experience is the filmmaker.
[4597.96 → 4602.04] The filmmaker's control over your emotions and your experience.
[4602.36 → 4604.60] You're having the experience that they give you.
[4604.66 → 4606.08] Otherwise you might as well play a game.
[4608.26 → 4608.62] Yeah.
[4608.62 → 4609.52] So yeah.
[4609.62 → 4609.84] So yeah.
[4609.84 → 4609.94] So yeah.
[4609.94 → 4610.36] Here we go.
[4610.44 → 4612.96] So this is an article from The Verge from like January this year.
[4613.14 → 4615.74] So you hide from a cyborg or something like that.
[4616.70 → 4619.12] I don't see movies moving there.
[4619.30 → 4623.82] I see movies and games moving closer together as opposed to VR movies.
[4623.82 → 4625.48] So, yes, do agree, Alan?
[4625.66 → 4628.14] I don't think it's next, and I don't know what it'll be called,
[4628.26 → 4629.82] but it'll be some kind of...
[4630.54 → 4632.28] Moorage?
[4633.46 → 4633.94] Moorage.
[4634.10 → 4634.42] Gamy?
[4635.22 → 4636.66] Moorage?
[4637.32 → 4638.90] Something, some combination of the two.
[4641.04 → 4641.72] What's coming?
[4641.82 → 4642.84] Wireless power for PCs.
[4643.12 → 4645.08] I think we're a ways away from that, too.
[4645.60 → 4647.24] Mind you, as PC power goes down,
[4647.34 → 4650.60] I can't think of any reason why a next or...
[4650.60 → 4651.40] Tell me you could do it now.
[4651.40 → 4654.04] Or two gens from now, like MacBook, for example,
[4654.96 → 4657.56] could be wirelessly powered from a range that would make sense.
[4657.82 → 4659.66] Yeah, because technically you could do that now.
[4659.72 → 4661.04] It's just going to be super not great.
[4661.22 → 4663.00] David Rice, cheaper, higher-resolution OLED?
[4663.20 → 4666.22] That is a super safe prediction there.
[4666.52 → 4667.72] USB 3.1 Type-C?
[4667.80 → 4669.12] That's already here, sort of.
[4669.44 → 4671.40] Yes, we do have one device that supports it.
[4671.98 → 4673.62] Cheaper, high-capacity SSDs?
[4673.62 → 4674.84] That's all definitely happening.
[4675.34 → 4676.14] Networked graphics?
[4676.32 → 4677.58] Would love that.
[4677.70 → 4679.36] I don't know if it's next, but...
[4679.36 → 4679.90] Well, okay.
[4679.90 → 4682.06] Strictly speaking, network graphics is already a thing.
[4682.16 → 4684.34] NVIDIA Grid is on a network, even if it's the internet.
[4684.50 → 4686.20] But I think you mean local network graphics.
[4687.06 → 4688.84] Better battery tech for laptops and phones?
[4688.90 → 4690.18] That's always coming next.
[4690.50 → 4691.40] Yeah, it's...
[4691.40 → 4691.82] I don't know.
[4692.32 → 4692.76] I don't know.
[4693.50 → 4695.36] 36-core Core i7 processor?
[4695.54 → 4696.28] That won't be for a while.
[4696.40 → 4697.36] I don't think it's coming next.
[4697.46 → 4699.90] I don't really think the battery thing is going to change a lot
[4699.90 → 4701.00] until we change technologies.
[4701.54 → 4702.66] Seven-day phone batteries.
[4702.74 → 4703.62] Did you see the light phone?
[4704.40 → 4705.14] The light phone.
[4705.14 → 4706.10] Yeah, this thing's bananas.
[4706.62 → 4708.46] It's like the stupidest thing ever.
[4708.88 → 4710.48] But like, people will like it.
[4710.82 → 4712.02] It's on Kickstarter right now.
[4712.10 → 4716.44] We don't generally cover Kickstarter stuff just because a lot of it ends up never existing.
[4717.88 → 4721.24] So the light phone by light, it met its goal.
[4721.74 → 4725.52] And pretty much what it is, is a credit card sized phone.
[4725.52 → 4729.60] And you have to take it with a big grain of salt whenever any manufacturer says credit card sized
[4729.60 → 4730.94] because it could be as thick as you want.
[4731.34 → 4732.48] Yeah, that's not credit card.
[4732.48 → 4733.54] That's not credit card sized.
[4733.64 → 4735.52] But the battery apparently lasts for 20 days.
[4736.20 → 4740.36] And straight up, all it does is make and receive phone calls.
[4741.18 → 4741.74] That's it.
[4741.86 → 4742.68] It is not smart.
[4744.96 → 4745.48] All right.
[4745.54 → 4746.26] And it's 100 bucks.
[4747.06 → 4747.42] I'm like, okay.
[4747.84 → 4748.24] Okay.
[4748.46 → 4749.06] I guess I get it.
[4749.08 → 4750.02] So we're bringing back the brick.
[4750.08 → 4750.86] Would you need a SIM?
[4751.02 → 4752.04] But it's like a sexy brick.
[4752.20 → 4752.94] Yeah, you'd need a SIM.
[4753.62 → 4754.30] That sucks.
[4754.30 → 4754.42] Yes.
[4755.26 → 4756.14] Speaker phone.
[4756.52 → 4756.88] Here we go.
[4756.98 → 4757.38] There you go.
[4757.38 → 4759.40] I guess you could always rip the SIM from your dead smartphone.
[4759.96 → 4760.20] Yeah.
[4761.10 → 4763.38] The light phone is a prepaid GSM cell phone.
[4763.38 → 4763.76] There you go.
[4763.78 → 4766.46] The voice independent of your carrier comes preloaded with minutes, a SIM card, and an
[4766.46 → 4767.76] app to use with your existing phone.
[4767.76 → 4768.22] Okay, that's cool.
[4768.70 → 4769.42] So there you go.
[4769.78 → 4770.84] So they're a carrier now.
[4770.98 → 4771.62] The light phone.
[4772.56 → 4773.12] By light.
[4776.26 → 4779.52] I love companies that don't have a crazy amount of forethought in their product names.
[4782.26 → 4782.90] It's great.
[4782.90 → 4783.90] I think it's awesome.
[4784.30 → 4784.76] All right.
[4784.82 → 4785.46] So what else we got?
[4785.56 → 4785.92] More responses from people?
[4786.56 → 4787.04] Oh, yeah.
[4787.12 → 4787.46] Yeah, sure.
[4787.54 → 4787.70] Okay.
[4787.76 → 4788.58] So we'll do 10 more.
[4788.64 → 4789.76] 10 more Twitter blitzes.
[4790.52 → 4792.68] Less local storage and more theft of data.
[4792.84 → 4793.04] Yeah.
[4793.30 → 4793.56] Okay.
[4794.20 → 4795.06] That's unfortunate.
[4796.68 → 4800.06] MADE says lower latency wireless to make things like wireless gaming peripherals a real
[4800.06 → 4800.66] viable option.
[4800.66 → 4800.80] Yeah.
[4800.84 → 4804.64] Right now, the only wireless gaming peripherals we have been extraordinarily expensive.
[4804.64 → 4812.28] And part of the problem with that is that when you add $3 to the arm cost of a peripheral
[4812.28 → 4817.20] product with the margin structure of that particular industry, you're adding anywhere from, I don't
[4817.20 → 4823.58] know, $5 to $15 to the actual retail price because retailers are expecting deep double-digit margins.
[4823.58 → 4825.82] The manufacturer is making deep double-digit margins.
[4826.20 → 4828.12] And people have different expectations for these products.
[4828.20 → 4831.16] If there's something wrong with it, they expect you to pop a new one in the mail for them and
[4831.16 → 4833.34] you expect to get it and not bother sending the old one back.
[4833.34 → 4838.22] And that's not the kind of thing that, you know, a motherboard manufacturer is ever going to
[4838.22 → 4840.44] support because the margins on that product don't support it.
[4840.50 → 4846.04] So in order to not fall behind in customer service and perceived value, you can't actually just
[4846.04 → 4848.64] make your product cheaper and then expect people to just accept that.
[4848.72 → 4851.38] They're going to expect all the other stuff and a better product and cheaper.
[4851.98 → 4853.12] So, yeah, good point.
[4853.38 → 4855.26] Lower cost and lower latency wireless.
[4856.36 → 4857.56] Yeah, it's always batteries.
[4857.82 → 4860.26] It's always batteries when we discuss what do people want.
[4860.42 → 4862.14] Well, I completely agree.
[4862.14 → 4863.22] I just don't think it's coming.
[4863.54 → 4865.26] Helix Slash, I hope you're wrong.
[4866.16 → 4867.14] VR system, yes.
[4867.36 → 4869.46] Curve screen laptop, wow, I hope you're wrong.
[4870.50 → 4872.90] If you had one that was flexible, maybe.
[4873.44 → 4874.00] But why?
[4874.12 → 4878.14] But I've used a 24-inch curved display, and it doesn't make sense.
[4878.98 → 4879.30] No.
[4879.50 → 4884.02] So, like, the curve from that, at that size doesn't make sense.
[4884.10 → 4887.72] So for a laptop, unless you're, like, you've got it, like, right to your face, I don't think
[4887.72 → 4888.60] it makes a ton of sense.
[4889.86 → 4890.86] That's quite the prediction.
[4890.86 → 4893.88] Apple will have nothing to do with unprecedented technologies at all.
[4895.08 → 4895.76] I don't...
[4895.76 → 4897.18] Well, actually, that's not really fair.
[4897.26 → 4898.34] I mean, Thunderbolt was unprecedented.
[4898.48 → 4899.58] They certainly had a lot to do with that.
[4900.52 → 4900.88] Just saying.
[4901.42 → 4903.14] I don't have much to say, but hi.
[4903.46 → 4903.94] All right.
[4903.94 → 4907.28] Another episode of Junkyard Wars.
[4907.52 → 4907.96] Wow.
[4908.24 → 4909.50] Now we're never filming again.
[4909.96 → 4910.54] Now we're...
[4910.54 → 4910.78] Okay.
[4910.94 → 4911.44] That's enough.
[4911.62 → 4912.52] No more Twitter blips.
[4912.58 → 4914.46] You just ruined it for everyone, Kevin Hall.
[4914.76 → 4915.74] Wow, Kevin Hall.
[4915.82 → 4916.76] Wow, Kevin Hall.
[4916.90 → 4917.94] Jeez, Kevin Hall.
[4918.02 → 4919.84] It's called Scrapyard Wars.
[4920.04 → 4920.64] I'm going to tweet that.
[4920.64 → 4921.30] When we do it.
[4921.42 → 4923.14] Junkyard Wars is some other show.
[4923.68 → 4924.66] In a junkyard.
[4924.74 → 4925.58] It probably smells.
[4926.28 → 4928.26] I just typed in tweet.com.
[4928.52 → 4929.80] That's how distraught I am.
[4929.80 → 4933.00] That's pretty distraught right there.
[4933.10 → 4934.64] That's quite distraught.
[4935.64 → 4938.80] Spotify is apparently going to have a New York press event.
[4939.12 → 4939.72] So this is...
[4939.72 → 4940.08] Oh, no.
[4940.16 → 4940.62] Not apparently.
[4940.74 → 4941.62] This is apparently a thing.
[4942.38 → 4947.98] So Spotify moves into video and podcasts with major media partnerships.
[4947.98 → 4953.08] So Spotify is not ready to lie down and have Apple completely eat their lunch on music streaming,
[4953.30 → 4956.60] nor are they wanting to limit themselves to music streaming forever.
[4956.60 → 4962.34] So short form videos and podcasts sourced from BBC, ESPN, and Comedy Central.
[4962.70 → 4965.38] ESPN is such a huge one.
[4965.72 → 4967.72] Sports is something that...
[4967.72 → 4969.58] I mean, where did we go for sports?
[4969.90 → 4970.78] Justin.tv?
[4970.98 → 4971.50] That's gone.
[4971.80 → 4973.12] Twitch no longer cares about that.
[4974.44 → 4975.18] So what?
[4975.22 → 4979.74] You have to just go to the individual sports network's website every time?
[4980.02 → 4982.58] To be honest, there was a lot of people watching the May weather fight on Twitch.
[4983.48 → 4984.80] It just wasn't a legal thing.
[4984.80 → 4986.88] Wow.
[4987.82 → 4993.30] Anyway, that's something YouTube doesn't do particularly well.
[4993.42 → 4997.78] It's something that some of the leagues, particularly the NHL, doesn't do particularly well,
[4998.16 → 5000.66] is things like highlights and analysis on YouTube.
[5001.16 → 5005.38] Having someone like ESPN come online with someone like Spotify,
[5005.90 → 5008.20] having other sports networks potentially sign up,
[5008.26 → 5010.44] that could be freaking awesome.
[5010.44 → 5010.56] Awesome.
[5010.92 → 5014.40] That's the kind of thing where if they start to get some really great content,
[5014.78 → 5016.38] maybe I get off Google Play Music.
[5016.50 → 5017.98] Maybe I start paying for Spotify instead.
[5018.28 → 5019.12] Get my music and that.
[5019.22 → 5020.64] And Comedy Central is another big one too,
[5020.74 → 5023.70] although regional licensing is going to be a huge one
[5023.70 → 5026.06] because Comedy Central, I doubt very much...
[5026.06 → 5026.18] Yeah.
[5026.30 → 5028.50] So service will be launched in US, UK, Germany, and Sweden.
[5028.64 → 5031.10] So Comedy Central is probably not coming to Canada anytime soon
[5031.10 → 5035.90] because I think there's some complicated stuff between Comedy Central and Comedy Network.
[5035.90 → 5036.20] Yeah.
[5036.20 → 5037.34] And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5038.12 → 5039.12] Regional, man.
[5039.56 → 5040.00] Sucks.
[5040.14 → 5040.72] It's annoying.
[5041.04 → 5041.42] Um.
[5041.74 → 5043.14] It's super hyper duper annoying.
[5043.28 → 5044.72] Apparently, this is cool though,
[5044.84 → 5047.14] Spotify's new version will have tempo detection,
[5047.40 → 5050.74] which will keep pace with your feet when you are working out.
[5050.74 → 5054.52] Why would you want that?
[5054.58 → 5055.18] I'd like that.
[5056.38 → 5058.38] Like something a little bit like...
[5058.38 → 5058.78] What?
[5058.78 → 5060.72] Like when you're walking, you listen to a different...
[5060.72 → 5061.10] No, no, no.
[5061.14 → 5062.80] The song doesn't speed up or slow down.
[5062.94 → 5063.20] That would be awful.
[5063.20 → 5063.44] Oh, yeah.
[5063.50 → 5065.12] I was like, what is the crap?
[5065.26 → 5066.12] Okay, that makes sense.
[5066.18 → 5067.32] So for song selection.
[5067.60 → 5067.88] Yeah.
[5068.68 → 5071.60] So if you're doing like a super hard workout, then like cool.
[5071.86 → 5073.76] And if you're not, then like that's cool too.
[5073.96 → 5075.16] Tempo as in...
[5075.16 → 5076.46] I'd like to see it tied to...
[5076.46 → 5077.94] I wish heart rate.
[5078.02 → 5078.96] I was just going to say.
[5079.04 → 5079.12] Yeah.
[5079.12 → 5080.42] I'd like to see it tied to heart rate instead.
[5080.42 → 5081.76] But this is a step in the right direction.
[5082.08 → 5082.98] Because that's one annoying thing.
[5083.04 → 5085.48] That watch that I'm not going to talk a ton about right now.
[5085.74 → 5087.94] I'll go bust out like a pretty intense workout.
[5088.96 → 5090.20] And then come home and be like,
[5090.38 → 5092.28] you were active for one minute today.
[5092.66 → 5093.92] And I'm like, screw you.
[5094.22 → 5095.28] That's not true.
[5096.50 → 5098.74] Is it because of the phone?
[5098.74 → 5099.88] Not a ton of movement.
[5101.22 → 5101.70] Right.
[5101.84 → 5102.82] Because you're like lifting.
[5103.20 → 5106.82] If I'm moving from like a squat rack to a bench or whatever,
[5107.12 → 5109.38] like it's really not that far.
[5109.38 → 5112.90] So what you're saying is that fitness trackers still have a ways to go
[5112.90 → 5115.86] for all the different types of fitness that happens to be.
[5115.94 → 5119.12] So me, for example, I engage in mind fitness.
[5119.58 → 5119.98] Wow.
[5120.68 → 5124.24] That's where I sit and think so hard about fitness that I get ripped.
[5124.94 → 5125.42] Nope.
[5125.72 → 5126.04] Nope.
[5126.26 → 5128.20] What about that belt that you can wear that vibrates?
[5128.52 → 5128.84] Oh.
[5128.84 → 5131.66] It is so funny.
[5131.88 → 5134.78] Like the celebrities that have sold out so hard.
[5134.90 → 5135.70] Well, that's exactly it.
[5135.76 → 5136.76] It's the celebrity endorsements.
[5137.06 → 5140.56] I saw a commercial for one of those things that had like Denise Richards and someone else
[5140.56 → 5140.88] in it.
[5141.22 → 5145.34] And I was like, are you really worth that little?
[5146.14 → 5149.34] If it worked, everyone would have one.
[5150.48 → 5151.00] Everybody.
[5151.00 → 5154.26] You know, they reached out about doing advertising with us once.
[5154.78 → 5155.30] One of them.
[5155.38 → 5156.38] I can't remember which one.
[5156.76 → 5157.56] We should do a review.
[5158.30 → 5158.80] No, no.
[5158.92 → 5160.76] It was like they weren't going to send a review unit.
[5160.88 → 5161.58] That was not the deal.
[5161.60 → 5162.24] Get them to send us.
[5162.36 → 5163.70] I'll wear it for like a month.
[5163.82 → 5164.06] Okay.
[5164.46 → 5164.48] So.
[5164.64 → 5166.50] Actually, no, it won't because I'm going to work out naturally.
[5166.64 → 5167.00] It's like dumb.
[5167.00 → 5171.40] Um, so, so basically I had never looked into them.
[5171.50 → 5173.42] Like I knew they were on late night TV.
[5173.70 → 5176.08] Not everything on late night TV is bad.
[5176.34 → 5178.84] The AMX, for example, is a great-handheld mixer.
[5179.18 → 5184.26] And it's one of those as seen on TV, like stupid commercial with, and you get the, the
[5184.26 → 5185.80] not scrambler with it.
[5185.98 → 5186.62] And that was the actual thing.
[5186.62 → 5188.16] Well, George Foreman grills are actually perfect.
[5188.16 → 5188.94] George Foreman grills.
[5189.08 → 5189.92] Also awesome.
[5190.16 → 5192.60] Probably anything that Billy Mays ever advertised.
[5193.72 → 5195.36] Because it's Billy freaking Mays.
[5195.38 → 5195.56] Am I a puppy?
[5195.76 → 5195.92] Really?
[5196.34 → 5196.70] I don't know.
[5196.72 → 5196.96] Okay.
[5197.00 → 5197.40] Anyway.
[5197.76 → 5202.18] Um, so I'd never looked into them because I just assumed they were stupid, but now we
[5202.18 → 5204.02] were having a real conversation with money involved.
[5204.08 → 5205.94] So I was like, okay, I should probably find out if they're dumb.
[5206.50 → 5210.10] And every site I found was so positive.
[5210.32 → 5214.06] And I was like, no, nothing can be that amazing.
[5214.60 → 5221.02] And it was at that time that I realized that basically they just spam websites.
[5221.32 → 5223.10] I was not aware of this particular strategy.
[5223.18 → 5226.58] I've never really looked into the ways people get scammed online because it was never really
[5226.58 → 5227.08] a concern for me.
[5227.08 → 5227.80] It's super a thing.
[5227.80 → 5230.60] I navigate directly to a website that I want to go to.
[5230.60 → 5231.58] I'm not much of a surfer.
[5231.58 → 5234.18] So I was like, oh.
[5234.18 → 5242.60] So they just create endless websites with slightly different SEO strategies so that something will
[5242.60 → 5242.96] surface.
[5242.96 → 5248.64] And they create them over and over and over again all the time so that something positive
[5248.64 → 5253.46] will surface before all the reviews about how it's completely stupid and pointless are
[5253.46 → 5254.52] able to be found.
[5254.52 → 5256.60] And I was like, okay, no.
[5257.00 → 5259.40] And go away.
[5259.40 → 5261.28] But yeah.
[5261.58 → 5262.90] I don't remember where I was going with this anymore.
[5263.54 → 5265.78] OCT has a new NVMe SSD.
[5266.14 → 5267.92] So NVMe SSDs are coming.
[5268.48 → 5268.88] Hooray.
[5269.02 → 5271.50] This was posted by NumLock21 on the forum.
[5271.60 → 5273.40] What available formats are there for this?
[5273.70 → 5274.84] The show's kind of over, by the way.
[5274.92 → 5275.40] But we can do this.
[5275.40 → 5275.72] Is it?
[5275.80 → 5276.32] What time is it?
[5276.44 → 5277.12] 6.10.
[5277.38 → 5278.22] How did that happen?
[5278.30 → 5278.94] 6.10.
[5279.18 → 5279.88] 6.10.
[5279.96 → 5282.46] I was going to say 9, but I assumed the minute was going to flip over.
[5283.14 → 5283.88] And then there we go.
[5283.96 → 5284.62] Now it's 6.10.
[5284.62 → 5291.74] While you were speaking, you thought the minute would actually flip over.
[5291.90 → 5292.24] I did.
[5292.36 → 5293.10] Like mid-word.
[5293.34 → 5293.58] I did.
[5293.60 → 5295.00] You were going to time it that precisely.
[5295.16 → 5296.14] That was the plan.
[5296.22 → 5296.58] You're a hero.
[5296.74 → 5298.26] I was off by like five seconds.
[5299.18 → 5305.42] So capacities anywhere from, I think it was 800 gigs to 6.4 terabytes.
[5305.70 → 5305.96] Boom.
[5307.90 → 5310.76] They're compliant with NVMe 1.1.
[5310.76 → 5314.98] They support two hosts accessing them simultaneously.
[5315.20 → 5317.28] Or apparently that update is coming in Q3 or something.
[5317.46 → 5320.54] Which is completely bananas.
[5321.18 → 5322.60] Like what the heck?
[5323.50 → 5330.78] Like so you could have a virtual machine natively accessing, like two virtual machines accessing
[5330.78 → 5332.46] it natively or something is what that sounds like to me.
[5332.50 → 5337.08] I'm sure someone's going to correct me, but that sounds completely off the hook.
[5337.08 → 5341.70] Um, and performance is in the neighbourhood of like three gigabytes per second.
[5342.18 → 5343.18] Uh, not, not quite.
[5343.32 → 5351.82] So sequential read speeds at 2.9 gigabytes per second and write speeds at 1.9 megabytes per
[5351.82 → 5352.80] second.
[5354.08 → 5354.96] Sustained!
[5356.06 → 5358.28] Using 19 nanometre NAND.
[5358.46 → 5363.98] And there's both a 6000 series using NLC flash and a 6300 series using Enterprise Grand
[5363.98 → 5365.14] ENAC flash.
[5366.02 → 5366.90] Very cool.
[5366.90 → 5368.72] Do we know what form factors it comes in?
[5369.00 → 5370.12] PCI Express, I would assume.
[5370.46 → 5371.90] No, uh...
[5372.52 → 5373.44] Really doubt it.
[5374.42 → 5379.30] Yeah, but it'll support, uh, self-encryption, uh, in, uh, Q, in the Q3 update.
[5380.30 → 5382.14] Um, end-to-end data protection.
[5382.48 → 5384.20] So this is all important Enterprise stuff.
[5384.30 → 5386.18] But yeah, okay, so here's the dual port functionality.
[5386.66 → 5390.18] It's going to launch with single port functionality with an upgrade in Q3.
[5390.18 → 5397.60] Uh, it does this using a newer generation of the 16-channel PMC Sierra Princeton controller than what is found on competing models.
[5397.60 → 5403.16] And the advantage of having dual port functionality is it allows two hosts to access the drive both concurrently.
[5403.16 → 5405.16] That's ridiculous.
[5405.16 → 5406.28] Okay, then.
[5406.78 → 5409.30] I guess we'll see what that sort of means.
[5409.42 → 5409.72] Yeah.
[5409.98 → 5410.94] Later on down the road.
[5411.48 → 5414.34] Um, should we do a couple of our, of our quick, our rapid fires?
[5414.58 → 5415.18] We can.
[5415.44 → 5416.62] We're 12 minutes over time.
[5416.62 → 5421.82] Uh, Dame Killer, um, posted on the forum that Ducky is teasing their first mouse.
[5422.46 → 5422.94] What?
[5423.60 → 5426.30] We don't have a whole ton of detail about this yet.
[5426.32 → 5428.72] Ducky never, they're always just like, random photo on Facebook.
[5429.04 → 5430.10] That's their whole thing.
[5430.48 → 5431.80] It's always ridiculous.
[5432.88 → 5433.64] Ducky Secret.
[5433.66 → 5435.86] Oh, dude, this will probably be in Taiwan.
[5436.22 → 5437.16] Continual improvement.
[5438.42 → 5440.28] Oh, yeah, they're definitely showing it at Computer.
[5441.22 → 5442.12] Uh, that's a thing.
[5442.62 → 5443.38] So, yep.
[5445.30 → 5446.14] La-di-da.
[5446.14 → 5447.70] DA-da-da-da.
[5447.70 → 5449.40] Doesn't look fascinating.
[5449.88 → 5451.24] Could a mouse look that interesting?
[5451.42 → 5451.78] No.
[5452.40 → 5454.54] Quality and precision is what matters, Luke.
[5454.64 → 5461.02] Hey, we put one of the like, very few good sensors in it and some plastic around it.
[5461.62 → 5462.52] That isn't bad.
[5462.70 → 5463.72] And Common switches.
[5464.16 → 5466.90] EA is apparently teasing Need for Speed Underground 3.
[5467.12 → 5467.56] Nice.
[5468.04 → 5471.22] So, they're going to have to prove that that's a good game before I play it.
[5471.22 → 5475.06] Yeah, someone told me, I think Nick told me about this, and I was like, yup, don't care.
[5475.06 → 5479.52] Was a huge fan of the previous ones, and I have no confidence that this will be good.
[5479.78 → 5481.26] But, I will pay attention.
[5481.40 → 5484.56] I'm not going to get hyped up, because there are so many ways that they could screw it up.
[5485.06 → 5489.66] Uh, the Logitech G29 is apparently in the final stages of validation.
[5489.66 → 5492.60] That is allegedly what it looks like.
[5492.94 → 5498.72] So, it's got a whack ton of buttons and seems to be targeted more at the PlayStation crowd.
[5498.94 → 5501.94] If we're to go by that, apparently, PlayStation logo.
[5502.04 → 5503.56] That looks like a PlayStation logo to me.
[5503.62 → 5504.08] It does.
[5504.12 → 5506.26] And the circle square X triangle button arrangement.
[5506.26 → 5508.22] That could be a different model thing, though.
[5508.22 → 5508.72] Could be.
[5509.00 → 5510.04] Absolutely could be.
[5510.38 → 5511.86] So, and you would only need two models.
[5511.86 → 5514.96] And they've done PlayStation exclusive wheels in the past.
[5515.16 → 5517.48] And then you could have like an Xbox slash PC one.
[5517.86 → 5518.04] Yeah.
[5518.48 → 5524.68] Um, Racer, uh, launched the Firefly Chroma Mouse Pad.
[5524.88 → 5529.60] So, this is posted by, oh, and the last one was, uh, from Tank Slayer X.
[5530.06 → 5531.04] Or just Tank Slayer, I guess.
[5531.24 → 5532.54] And this one's from Ah Ming.
[5532.70 → 5534.70] An original article here is from Tom's Hardware.
[5534.70 → 5541.90] Um, so, if the question you were asking yourself was, what can we put RGB LEDs in next?
[5542.00 → 5543.10] The answer is a mouse pad.
[5545.18 → 5547.70] You know, I was really amped about the RGB keyboards.
[5548.46 → 5549.76] And I super don't care anymore.
[5549.88 → 5550.58] Do you care anymore?
[5550.98 → 5552.58] I still have one on my desk.
[5553.08 → 5553.34] Okay.
[5553.54 → 5554.70] And I have it set to...
[5554.70 → 5554.72] I don't.
[5554.96 → 5559.30] I have it set to kind of purple colour that's very similar to the UV lights in my case.
[5559.42 → 5559.68] Okay.
[5559.68 → 5563.58] And since then, I have not touched any kinds of effects or anything.
[5563.80 → 5564.98] Because it's kind of distracting.
[5565.30 → 5565.68] It is.
[5566.08 → 5566.72] And I don't care.
[5567.06 → 5567.44] And you know what?
[5567.48 → 5571.12] I like my PBT keycaps so much that I just want that and no glow.
[5571.56 → 5573.42] Because I never look at my keyboard anyway.
[5573.58 → 5574.68] I do still like the backlight.
[5575.54 → 5576.50] I like the backlight.
[5576.52 → 5576.84] Sure.
[5577.06 → 5577.72] That's fine.
[5577.92 → 5578.52] But I don't know.
[5578.80 → 5580.10] I was super hyped for it too.
[5580.18 → 5582.22] I was like, yay, innovation in keyboards.
[5582.40 → 5584.52] And then I was like, I actually don't care.
[5584.76 → 5586.08] I just like my nice keycaps.
[5586.22 → 5586.88] So there you go.
[5586.88 → 5589.98] Now you can plug your mouse pad in via USB as well.
[5590.68 → 5594.58] I'm really glad they didn't put LEDs on the actual surface of the mouse pad.
[5594.70 → 5596.82] Because it probably would have wrecked tracking on every mouse ever.
[5596.88 → 5599.46] But I'm sure Rays are smart enough to not do something that phenomenally stupid.
[5599.92 → 5600.96] So there you go.
[5601.16 → 5601.82] You can have a...
[5601.82 → 5603.06] The next product comes out.
[5603.52 → 5603.88] Yeah.
[5605.32 → 5606.24] Interlaced LEDs.
[5607.42 → 5611.70] The woven fibres of the mouse pad have LED elements at either end.
[5611.76 → 5612.92] And you can like to make a rainbow.
[5613.08 → 5614.16] You can like make man cat.
[5614.42 → 5615.84] They're in the shape of snakes.
[5615.84 → 5620.20] They slither across the mouse pad in a destructive manner.
[5622.20 → 5622.60] Um...
[5622.60 → 5625.44] This is just funny because of his name.
[5625.64 → 5626.94] Original articles from Polygon.
[5627.02 → 5628.12] This was posted by Goodbyes.
[5628.52 → 5629.80] Nintendo's new VP of sales.
[5629.82 → 5629.94] Oh yeah.
[5629.94 → 5631.52] His name is actually Doug Bowser.
[5632.00 → 5632.32] Yeah.
[5633.28 → 5637.00] In his like photo that they took of him in his new office or whatever.
[5637.22 → 5638.78] Saying like thank you for the warm welcome.
[5638.78 → 5641.14] There's uh...
[5641.14 → 5646.84] Mario and Luigi tied up by a Game Cube controller in the background on the shelf.
[5647.52 → 5648.90] That was like a joke.
[5649.76 → 5650.14] Yeah.
[5650.30 → 5651.08] So that's uh...
[5651.08 → 5651.62] That's...
[5651.62 → 5652.48] That's pretty funny.
[5652.72 → 5653.18] That's kind of great.
[5653.32 → 5653.64] Um...
[5653.64 → 5656.18] And I guess that's pretty much all there is to say about that.
[5656.28 → 5658.66] Thank you guys very much for tuning in to the WAN show.
[5658.66 → 5659.66] Um...
[5659.66 → 5662.94] Oh that's kind of cool.
[5663.02 → 5666.78] Wounded turtle can return to the ocean thanks to a 3D printed titanium beak.
[5666.78 → 5672.02] It's like a future turtle.
[5672.74 → 5673.38] Look at that man.
[5673.76 → 5674.54] Wow that's badass.
[5675.02 → 5675.28] Yeah.
[5675.38 → 5676.92] It actually looks like uh...
[5676.92 → 5677.94] Like uh...
[5677.94 → 5680.78] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles like...
[5680.78 → 5681.82] Character or something.
[5682.78 → 5683.52] That's cool.
[5683.78 → 5689.36] Someone is going to make a video game bad guy or like movie character based on this picture.
[5689.46 → 5689.98] Mark my words.
[5690.08 → 5690.52] But do...
[5690.52 → 5692.20] That's the coolest looking thing ever.
[5692.20 → 5695.26] People already have like metal replacement stuff.
[5695.26 → 5697.00] Yeah but it'll be like really based on this.
[5697.08 → 5697.98] Like it'll be very close.
[5698.80 → 5699.52] It'll be close.
[5699.70 → 5700.00] Okay.
[5700.32 → 5701.72] It's a prediction that I can't lose on.
[5702.46 → 5703.94] Unlike the one about these t-shirts.
[5704.22 → 5705.12] Which I can lose on.
[5705.48 → 5707.52] Did I tell them what exactly the wager was?
[5707.62 → 5707.84] No.
[5708.56 → 5708.96] Okay.
[5709.10 → 5709.54] I thought you weren't going to.
[5709.54 → 5710.64] Well I'll do that on After Party.
[5711.32 → 5711.60] Rest.
[5711.94 → 5713.54] Alright, so thanks for watching guys.
[5713.98 → 5714.38] Bye.
[5714.54 → 5715.02] Long show.
[5715.14 → 5715.76] See you next week.
[5716.38 → 5718.86] No I don't think the show was actually long because we started quite late.
[5720.08 → 5721.44] It wasn't crazy long.
[5721.44 → 5722.18] We'll find out.
[5722.28 → 5723.72] It's like five minutes long or something.
[5724.56 → 5725.24] Sometimes it's long.
[5725.26 → 5725.76] Yeah.
[5727.18 → 5728.52] Sometimes it's not about the length.
[5729.96 → 5730.48] You know what?
[5730.60 → 5732.20] The girth of the show.
[5733.04 → 5734.48] Is the girth your bandwidth?
[5736.64 → 5737.04] Um.
[5737.24 → 5737.60] I don't know.
[5737.66 → 5739.16] Because what would like to ping times be then?
[5740.10 → 5740.84] Your uh.
[5740.86 → 5742.04] How fast you are.
[5742.20 → 5742.72] Repetition.
[5743.74 → 5745.12] No because ping is just.
[5745.14 → 5745.42] Iteration?
[5745.54 → 5745.88] Iteration.
[5745.88 → 5745.94] Iteration.
