[0.00 --> 4.00]  Okay.
[4.00 --> 11.72]  You may not be able to tell this, but we have actually moved since last week.
[11.88 --> 12.54]  Not much.
[12.66 --> 13.00]  Well...
[13.60 --> 14.26]  Is it an improvement?
[14.60 --> 15.76]  It was enough that...
[15.76 --> 16.76]  No, it's not an improvement.
[17.76 --> 18.48]  It was...
[18.48 --> 21.04]  You might not know this, but things got worse.
[21.28 --> 22.32]  Welcome to the WAN Show.
[22.42 --> 23.78]  We're only half an hour late.
[24.34 --> 25.42]  What is this music?
[25.60 --> 26.92]  And his laptop has audio.
[27.26 --> 28.52]  Oh, shut up.
[28.52 --> 30.08]  All right.
[30.22 --> 30.60]  Good.
[30.80 --> 31.70]  We've got cool topics.
[31.70 --> 33.76]  Yeah, we've got great topics today.
[33.84 --> 34.66]  So at least there's that.
[34.82 --> 43.38]  And the reason we're late is actually pretty much the coolest video that I have ever made.
[43.54 --> 43.84]  Wow.
[43.98 --> 45.18]  Do you think I'm overselling it?
[46.64 --> 47.48]  Do you think...
[47.48 --> 47.70]  Really?
[47.74 --> 48.30]  There was a bug.
[48.36 --> 49.54]  Okay, what have I...
[49.54 --> 52.08]  Okay, do you think I'm overselling this video?
[52.08 --> 52.86]  Maybe not.
[53.06 --> 55.66]  I think there's really good contenders, but this is pretty badass.
[55.88 --> 58.26]  So guys, it's a build log.
[58.52 --> 62.84]  But it's going to be a build log where the part where I physically build the computer
[62.84 --> 67.58]  is literally like 30 seconds to a minute.
[67.80 --> 69.06]  And like the least important part.
[69.18 --> 72.92]  Yeah, it's the single least interesting part of the build log.
[73.22 --> 74.58]  It's like over there.
[74.64 --> 79.22]  It actually legitimately isn't working now, but there's a good reason for that.
[79.22 --> 82.98]  And people are like, the WAN show logo is too big.
[83.08 --> 83.64]  You know what?
[83.92 --> 84.54]  We have...
[85.02 --> 85.74]  You're too big.
[86.64 --> 88.52]  There's no such thing as too big.
[88.84 --> 89.28]  Technically.
[90.88 --> 92.14]  You could train up to it.
[92.14 --> 98.68]  We have had way worse issues than like the WAN show logo is a little bit big.
[98.96 --> 99.74]  Way worse.
[99.90 --> 100.36]  Way worse.
[100.50 --> 101.54]  Beyond way worse.
[101.92 --> 104.10]  Please fix the left hand logo.
[104.44 --> 105.16]  You know what?
[105.70 --> 106.34]  Tell you what.
[106.52 --> 108.34]  That'll be what we tackle next week.
[108.52 --> 114.40]  Instead of completely moving the entire set to make room to make the coolest video that
[114.40 --> 118.62]  I have ever done, I will change the location of the WAN show logo.
[118.70 --> 121.88]  In the meantime, though, we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today.
[122.64 --> 128.98]  Microsoft announced a whack ton of hardware, including the Lumia 950 and 950 XL, the Surface
[128.98 --> 130.62]  Pro 4, the Surface Book.
[131.00 --> 132.84]  I've actually got a Surface Pro 4.
[132.92 --> 135.40]  I will be unboxing it live later on the show.
[135.48 --> 137.26]  So we'll be getting our first impressions of it.
[137.88 --> 138.66]  What else we got?
[138.68 --> 140.88]  You can hack smartphones with just a text message.
[140.88 --> 145.48]  Thank you, Edward Snowden, for telling us these things.
[145.92 --> 146.82]  Yeah, basically.
[147.52 --> 151.58]  The People site that we smashed on last week, and honestly, I thought of a ton of reasons
[151.58 --> 157.84]  why it was even worse later on after the show, has apparently kind of disappeared, but the
[157.84 --> 159.50]  creator is still moving ahead with the release.
[160.24 --> 162.78]  Dell's got a bunch of interesting stuff that they want.
[162.80 --> 164.94]  Actually, there's just like a ton of stuff this week.
[165.32 --> 168.98]  Ars Technica has their Android Marshmallow review up, so we'll be talking about that a
[168.98 --> 169.28]  little bit.
[169.28 --> 170.74]  So stay tuned.
[170.86 --> 173.60]  And there's a sale on the Linus Tech Tips District Line Store.
[173.72 --> 175.54]  All remaining inventory is 50% off.
[175.64 --> 178.20]  Mostly small in 2X and 3XL shirts are remaining.
[178.56 --> 180.34]  Lanyards are still there for only $3.99.
[181.58 --> 182.40]  Oh, okay.
[182.52 --> 183.64]  Weren't we supposed to do that later?
[183.82 --> 184.58]  I don't know.
[185.00 --> 186.06]  We can also do it later.
[199.28 --> 215.54]  We can also do it later.
[215.54 --> 217.26]  We can also do it later.
[217.26 --> 219.42]  We can also do it later.
[219.42 --> 220.88]  Look.
[220.88 --> 222.14]  What's up?
[222.40 --> 224.42]  Are you really selfie-ing during the WAN show?
[224.52 --> 225.80]  You're taking a blurry selfie.
[226.04 --> 227.82]  You managed to close your eyes.
[228.26 --> 228.58]  Okay.
[228.82 --> 229.04]  What?
[229.36 --> 229.68]  No, no.
[229.68 --> 230.30]  No, no.
[230.40 --> 230.88]  No, no.
[230.88 --> 231.08]  No, no.
[231.28 --> 232.04]  No, they're open.
[233.26 --> 234.04]  It's not even that bad.
[234.06 --> 234.38]  Oh, okay.
[234.38 --> 235.36]  You're just not smiling.
[235.46 --> 236.40]  You're like, what?
[236.76 --> 238.96]  Your selfie cam is not very good on that phone, actually.
[238.96 --> 239.96]  It's pretty terrible, actually.
[239.96 --> 240.30]  Wow.
[240.92 --> 242.32]  That's actually kind of surprising.
[242.44 --> 243.90]  You know what has a great selfie cam?
[244.12 --> 245.08]  The new Galaxies.
[245.52 --> 245.88]  Oh, really?
[245.92 --> 247.72]  Yeah, the S6 and the Note 5.
[247.86 --> 250.58]  They have wicked selfie cams.
[250.58 --> 251.72]  It's actually kind of amazing.
[251.84 --> 252.02]  Okay.
[252.36 --> 254.86]  Because I was going to say, that would be a whole other level of fail.
[255.34 --> 258.40]  Managing to blink when you're the one controlling the shutter.
[260.10 --> 262.60]  I've probably done it, just to be fair.
[262.68 --> 265.94]  It's one thing to be like, someone else is taking a picture, and you're like,
[266.40 --> 268.90]  right when they take the picture.
[269.08 --> 269.20]  Yeah.
[269.20 --> 270.94]  That's like still kind of fail.
[271.32 --> 271.86]  A little bit.
[271.94 --> 273.10]  It's a little bit fail.
[273.16 --> 273.28]  Yeah.
[273.32 --> 275.54]  But to do it to yourself is pretty bad.
[275.62 --> 277.18]  Oh, you know what else arrived today?
[277.40 --> 280.28]  I got my rose gold iPhone 6S.
[280.54 --> 281.00]  Oh, damn.
[281.00 --> 283.78]  Also known as pink iPhone 6S.
[283.78 --> 284.22]  I was just going to say, yeah.
[284.32 --> 289.06]  Because calling it rose gold is the most pretentious nonsense thing ever.
[289.36 --> 291.96]  Is it actually, does it have a golden hinge, or is it just super pink?
[292.54 --> 293.24]  Well, okay.
[293.24 --> 293.72]  Do you have it?
[293.74 --> 295.54]  We've got to be careful of bumping the mic.
[296.98 --> 298.28]  Sorry about the mic bumps.
[300.20 --> 307.72]  Like, it has a rose gold look to it in the same sense that the gold iPhone is not a yellow
[307.72 --> 311.44]  iPhone, which it like, it doesn't look gold.
[311.54 --> 314.64]  It looks like kind of, you know, orangey, yellowy, kind of gold-ish.
[314.64 --> 318.44]  So it looks rose gold in the same sense that something...
[318.44 --> 319.66]  It's behind the...
[319.66 --> 320.48]  They can't see that at all.
[320.48 --> 322.66]  Something rose gold would look kind of pink.
[322.76 --> 325.14]  So, well, you guys can't see this at all.
[325.24 --> 326.02]  So, whatever.
[326.46 --> 332.24]  You'll see the roll of it in the review that I do later on, which...
[332.24 --> 333.24]  I had that there for a reason.
[333.46 --> 334.82]  I know, but you can't see it.
[335.42 --> 336.04]  It's okay.
[336.04 --> 337.60]  You can't see it because it's behind me.
[338.00 --> 339.08]  We'll deal with that later.
[339.80 --> 340.16]  Okay.
[340.34 --> 340.50]  There.
[340.90 --> 343.16]  So, let's go ahead and...
[343.16 --> 345.58]  Why don't we just kick things off with our first topic here today?
[345.64 --> 345.90]  Sure.
[346.52 --> 349.90]  We'll actually start the show immediately for a change.
[350.34 --> 354.90]  So, the 10 most important things from the Microsoft event.
[355.58 --> 357.88]  This was posted by Matt Woodson on the forum.
[358.00 --> 362.42]  I'm going to go ahead and pull up the original article here from Ars Technica.
[362.50 --> 364.18]  You want to go ahead and throw that forum link in there?
[364.18 --> 364.62]  I wasn't sure which one you're going to.
[364.62 --> 364.82]  Oh, no.
[364.82 --> 367.28]  I thought you were doing the forum link in the chat, right?
[367.46 --> 367.82]  Okay.
[368.20 --> 369.12]  Don't we usually do that?
[369.24 --> 369.48]  No.
[369.70 --> 369.98]  Oh.
[370.70 --> 372.28]  Well, okay then.
[372.38 --> 372.82]  I can.
[374.64 --> 375.40]  Hands on.
[375.40 --> 379.90]  The Surface Pro 4 is a design that's settled down.
[381.20 --> 384.72]  Refines almost everything but keeps the basic look and feel of the Pro 3.
[384.86 --> 385.18]  Excellent.
[385.32 --> 385.76]  Very nice.
[385.86 --> 386.02]  Okay.
[386.08 --> 388.82]  So, let's go through what all happened at the event there.
[388.94 --> 389.78]  There goes a train.
[390.32 --> 391.98]  So, they announced the Lumia 950.
[392.08 --> 394.66]  This is the Windows 10 mobile flagship.
[394.88 --> 401.86]  It's got a Snapdragon 808 processor which seems to be what the smart smartphone makers are using these days.
[401.86 --> 402.32]  Yep.
[402.32 --> 423.58]  We actually have a video up on Vessel where I took two Snapdragon 810 based phones, a Snapdragon 808 based phone, an Apple A9 based phone, and an Exynos 7420 based phone, and liquid cooled them all to find out how much they throttle and how much they're capable of if they don't thermal throttle.
[423.58 --> 428.30]  And both of our 810 based phones were just abominable.
[428.42 --> 429.14]  Like, it was terrible.
[429.14 --> 433.36]  Tablet class liquid cooling technology.
[433.60 --> 436.48]  As if it needs that with an 808, but whatever.
[436.74 --> 438.26]  It features USB Type-C.
[438.90 --> 440.22]  Huge thumbs up there.
[440.26 --> 446.38]  I don't even care about rapid quick charge features compared to having a Type-C connector.
[446.38 --> 447.74]  Okay, compared to you.
[447.88 --> 449.04]  I was going to say they're pretty cool.
[449.12 --> 449.94]  No, no, I do care.
[450.00 --> 450.28]  Yeah.
[450.92 --> 459.88]  Like, I've actually found myself not being bothered nearly as much by iPhone battery this time around.
[459.96 --> 460.70]  And I don't know.
[460.80 --> 468.26]  Maybe I got a TSMC chip versus a Samsung chip which is supposed to get better battery or something.
[468.60 --> 469.42]  But bleh.
[470.06 --> 471.24]  And I haven't checked.
[471.30 --> 473.12]  I haven't checked what CPU mine is using.
[473.20 --> 475.82]  But I found I'm actually doing really well.
[475.82 --> 478.82]  Like, I had a three and a half hour call with someone yesterday.
[479.00 --> 482.88]  In addition to using my phone like I normally do, I've got the Apple Watch.
[483.06 --> 485.08]  So I'm paired via Bluetooth all the time.
[485.54 --> 488.20]  And I almost made it to bedtime.
[488.44 --> 491.02]  Like, it ran out like half an hour before I was going to go to bed.
[491.10 --> 492.86]  That's still so not okay though.
[492.98 --> 493.40]  I know.
[493.56 --> 494.12]  But hold on.
[494.24 --> 498.64]  But then you plug it in for like 20 minutes and you've got a very significant charge.
[498.80 --> 498.90]  I don't care.
[499.14 --> 499.48]  Yeah.
[499.80 --> 504.00]  Like, there's a fail or not fail for me.
[504.00 --> 506.18]  And if you fail, you just fail.
[506.34 --> 507.30]  I don't care if it was close.
[507.46 --> 508.12]  You just still fail.
[508.18 --> 510.98]  Droid Turbo 2 is rumored to be coming in about a week.
[510.98 --> 521.44]  So I have already started trying to get my tentacles into either Motorola or D brand or someone.
[521.62 --> 522.02]  I don't care.
[522.26 --> 525.22]  Heck, I would even talk to Verizon if it was.
[526.10 --> 528.88]  It's going to be a Verizon exclusive again is the rumor.
[529.88 --> 531.72]  But man, I am super stoked on that.
[531.72 --> 536.26]  It looks like the battery capacity may be a touch lower than last time actually.
[537.22 --> 541.66]  But, I mean, assuming they get a bunch of other optimizations right, it could still deliver.
[541.76 --> 543.34]  Just exceptional time on.
[543.62 --> 545.22]  Anyway, back to the Lumia 950.
[545.32 --> 547.58]  Sorry, I got distracted by phones that matter.
[548.02 --> 549.74]  Oh, dang.
[550.08 --> 553.42]  Actually, Windows 10 Mobile has some pretty cool looking stuff.
[553.60 --> 554.32]  So, yeah.
[554.38 --> 557.52]  USB Type-C, 32 gigs of storage with a microSD slot.
[557.84 --> 559.92]  And launching in November for $549.
[559.92 --> 564.58]  There will also be an XL version featuring the Snapdragon 810 processor.
[564.72 --> 566.94]  Hopefully, the chassis is big enough to dissipate the heat.
[568.96 --> 570.18]  With blah, blah, blah.
[570.30 --> 571.00]  What else changes?
[571.14 --> 571.60]  Not a whole lot.
[571.66 --> 573.26]  5.7 inch screen.
[574.18 --> 575.36]  So, there are some other devices.
[575.52 --> 576.44]  There's a Lumia 550.
[576.76 --> 579.76]  So, this replaces the 640 and 640 XL.
[581.20 --> 582.66]  The Surface Dock.
[582.76 --> 584.76]  So, it's a display dock.
[585.06 --> 589.32]  So, this will allow you to turn your phones into a PC-like experience.
[589.92 --> 591.42]  This is some cool stuff.
[591.42 --> 592.38]  Now, to be clear.
[592.82 --> 595.64]  Because these Snapdragon processors are ARM-based.
[595.74 --> 600.02]  You're not going to be, you know, running friggin' XSplit on it.
[600.24 --> 602.06]  And, you know, game streaming off your phone.
[602.06 --> 604.38]  You won't be running x86 applications.
[605.14 --> 610.04]  But, you will still be able to have a very Windows-like experience.
[610.40 --> 615.02]  And, for applications that do have ARM versions, like Office, for example,
[615.34 --> 617.84]  you will be able to use those.
[618.10 --> 619.28]  This is something I was wondering about.
[619.28 --> 621.84]  I was actually going to pitch this to you as a Linus Tech Tips video.
[622.42 --> 624.04]  Again, I've done this before.
[624.24 --> 625.18]  It's probably a terrible idea.
[625.40 --> 626.46]  I'll just pitch it to you on stream.
[626.66 --> 627.28]  We'll see what you think.
[627.28 --> 631.44]  I was thinking about, like, OTG extravaganza.
[632.42 --> 638.80]  Where we take a phone and try to be like, could you manage to, like, go through school with just your phone?
[639.10 --> 642.58]  So, it's an OTG cable and, like, splitters and an inline power thing.
[642.58 --> 644.04]  So, you would want to do it the ghetto way.
[644.24 --> 644.58]  Yeah.
[644.58 --> 647.62]  See if we can get, like, a keyboard and a mouse.
[647.88 --> 650.56]  Maybe even see if we can get that portable monitor running off of it.
[650.62 --> 653.16]  Off of, like, a massive battery bank or something?
[653.30 --> 653.60]  Yeah.
[654.88 --> 655.28]  Well, no.
[655.34 --> 656.26]  Because you're in class.
[656.32 --> 657.40]  You could plug it into the wall.
[659.10 --> 659.42]  Yeah.
[659.54 --> 659.96]  I don't know.
[660.04 --> 663.48]  Back when I was in school, there was a severe shortage of plugs.
[663.72 --> 663.96]  Like...
[663.96 --> 665.12]  I went to class with a power bar.
[665.96 --> 666.28]  Okay.
[666.40 --> 666.80]  Fair enough.
[666.82 --> 667.74]  Everyone loved me.
[667.74 --> 669.08]  You could just tell someone else.
[669.08 --> 672.52]  You want to make quick, techie friends in school, bring a power bar.
[672.64 --> 673.08]  I'm not even kidding.
[673.16 --> 673.66]  That's all you need.
[673.86 --> 674.18]  Anyways.
[674.38 --> 674.58]  Sorry.
[674.90 --> 675.80]  But I thought it could be fun.
[675.86 --> 677.80]  Just, like, what is the extent you could go...
[677.80 --> 680.58]  And with, like, modern, pretty fast phones that you could have word processors on...
[680.58 --> 680.76]  Right.
[681.80 --> 682.08]  Yeah.
[682.30 --> 686.08]  Is it enough to just, like, take notes with a keyboard and mouse and maybe a bigger screen?
[686.08 --> 687.32]  Microsoft wants it to be doable out of the box.
[687.50 --> 687.62]  Yeah.
[687.62 --> 688.98]  But then you'd have to use a Windows phone.
[689.42 --> 689.68]  Yeah.
[689.84 --> 691.44]  And, like, how much does that thing cost?
[691.86 --> 693.04]  So, you have to have a Windows phone.
[693.64 --> 693.84]  Yeah.
[693.84 --> 694.84]  And you have to buy this thing.
[694.84 --> 695.50]  You have to buy the dog.
[695.50 --> 698.56]  The idea is, like, hopefully you just have to kind of buy the adapters and you already
[698.56 --> 699.20]  have a keyboard and mouse.
[699.20 --> 700.50]  The dog is pretty cool, though.
[700.56 --> 704.80]  So, it plugs in with the Type-C connector and provides ports for HDMI, DisplayPort, and
[704.80 --> 706.54]  three full-size USB ports.
[706.82 --> 712.08]  So, you really could have, like, a very desktop-like experience plugging into this bad boy.
[712.68 --> 712.82]  Yeah.
[713.18 --> 713.90]  Other things.
[713.98 --> 715.30]  So, the Surface Pro 4.
[715.40 --> 718.58]  Maybe now's a good time to do the live unboxing.
[718.58 --> 718.60]  There you go.
[723.34 --> 724.88]  Hopefully it doesn't just fall out.
[724.88 --> 726.54]  My box is very plain.
[726.68 --> 730.44]  I actually got this from the Vancouver Microsoft folks.
[730.50 --> 731.44]  They dropped it off today.
[731.92 --> 736.00]  The timing is terrible because I ordered one last night thinking that I was just going to
[736.00 --> 737.68]  have to buy one in order to get one.
[738.38 --> 739.22]  Can you just cancel it?
[739.32 --> 739.58]  Yeah.
[739.68 --> 739.82]  Yeah.
[739.90 --> 742.10]  No, I still can because it's just a pre-order.
[742.50 --> 743.76]  So, I will cancel my order.
[744.00 --> 745.36]  But there you go.
[745.62 --> 746.82]  It's the Surface Pro 3.
[746.94 --> 750.12]  The pen is sort of magnetically stuck to it right now.
[750.22 --> 753.06]  I'm actually legitimately not sure if that's supposed to go there.
[753.06 --> 757.02]  No, that's for the type cover.
[757.96 --> 758.68]  So, we'll go ahead and...
[758.68 --> 758.94]  Do you have a type cover?
[759.00 --> 759.94]  Is that for the type cover?
[760.02 --> 761.32]  I do have a type cover, yes.
[761.32 --> 761.46]  Cool.
[761.84 --> 765.68]  I actually, I asked them that too because I was legitimately not even going to bother
[765.68 --> 768.32]  taking the device from them if they didn't have a type cover for it.
[768.32 --> 772.98]  Because I was just like, yeah, realistically, I can't review a Surface device without the
[772.98 --> 773.84]  type cover anyway.
[774.30 --> 775.90]  So, I might as well just wait.
[776.20 --> 777.66]  People are saying three or four?
[778.24 --> 778.78]  Three or four what?
[778.78 --> 779.02]  Did you say three?
[779.44 --> 779.98]  Did I say three?
[780.06 --> 780.20]  Sorry.
[780.28 --> 781.48]  No, this is the Surface Pro 4.
[781.70 --> 781.96]  Yeah.
[782.18 --> 782.44]  Okay.
[782.72 --> 784.62]  So, there we go.
[785.04 --> 787.06]  That snaps on a little something like that.
[787.52 --> 789.68]  It's got a kickstand a little something like that.
[789.68 --> 792.84]  It still closes, something like that.
[792.90 --> 797.22]  It's got a couple of different angles and junk so you can do things with it.
[798.34 --> 803.90]  I sort of think I agree so far with Ars Technica's evaluation.
[805.26 --> 811.08]  Not having a Surface Pro 3 in front of me, you could just tell me this is a Surface Pro
[811.08 --> 814.26]  3 and I would literally never know the difference at all.
[814.26 --> 818.54]  So, you've got your mini display port here, you've got a regular USB connector.
[819.62 --> 823.98]  Over on the other side, you've got your headphone jack, you've got your webcam, you've got your
[823.98 --> 824.78]  microSD slot.
[824.86 --> 826.76]  Yeah, pretty much looks like the same damn thing.
[827.26 --> 828.72]  I've got the 128 gig model.
[828.72 --> 830.54]  Show the screen disconnect joint.
[831.40 --> 832.70]  The screen disconnect joint.
[832.70 --> 835.92]  Is it not the same as the old one?
[836.94 --> 838.52]  This isn't the Surface Book.
[838.90 --> 841.38]  Yeah, this is not the Surface Book.
[841.38 --> 844.22]  This is the Surface Pro 4.
[844.44 --> 850.74]  So, this is still just the tablet that I turned off when I went to turn it around and show you
[850.74 --> 852.78]  guys the screen, which...
[852.78 --> 853.08]  Whoa!
[853.46 --> 853.90]  Whatever.
[854.04 --> 855.16]  Let's just get through the specs.
[855.36 --> 856.32]  There will be a review coming.
[856.64 --> 862.78]  I do also have an order in for the top tier Surface Book and I will be reviewing that as
[862.78 --> 863.18]  well.
[863.46 --> 868.04]  So, the Surface Pro 4, 12.3 inch display with reduced bezels, so a bigger screen without
[868.04 --> 869.68]  actually increasing the device size.
[869.94 --> 870.30]  There you go.
[870.30 --> 873.30]  Up to a terabyte of SSD storage, up to 16 gigs of RAM.
[873.48 --> 874.52]  Thank you!
[875.30 --> 880.74]  Both the Surface Book and the Surface Pro 4 are available with up to 16 gigs of RAM.
[881.30 --> 882.02]  Thank you!
[882.02 --> 886.08]  Given how much memory a freaking web browser can use these days.
[886.16 --> 887.50]  And don't tell me it's Chrome.
[887.62 --> 888.80]  It's all a Chrome problem.
[889.36 --> 889.80]  All right?
[889.92 --> 891.34]  They're all guilty of it.
[891.34 --> 896.98]  16 gigs of RAM is a must if you are multitasking.
[897.34 --> 900.66]  It features a 6-gen Intel Core i5 or i7.
[900.72 --> 902.06]  I think there's an i3 model, actually.
[902.42 --> 903.38]  Skylake processor.
[903.78 --> 908.84]  And they're claiming it is 50% faster than a MacBook Air and 30% faster than a Surface
[908.84 --> 909.28]  Pro 3.
[909.28 --> 912.02]  But is its battery life as good as a MacBook Air?
[912.14 --> 913.50]  Yeah, that is a serious...
[913.50 --> 914.28]  Damn, that was impressive.
[914.28 --> 919.54]  That is a serious thing to overcome about the MacBook Air if you're going to try and compete with
[919.54 --> 920.02]  that puppy.
[920.24 --> 920.46]  Yeah.
[920.60 --> 925.64]  It's got a fingerprint scanner, a hybrid cooling system, Gorilla Glass 4, and you can call
[925.64 --> 929.06]  Cortana by holding down the button on the Surface Pen.
[929.58 --> 931.50]  The type cover is also the thinnest ever.
[931.90 --> 934.04]  Actually, that may be noticeable.
[934.46 --> 936.14]  It's been a while since I've played with one, though.
[936.28 --> 938.38]  And has a 40% larger trackpad.
[938.38 --> 943.12]  That is a noticeable improvement with 5-point multi-touch support.
[944.22 --> 948.02]  And the Surface Book is the first ever 2-in-1 laptop built by Microsoft.
[948.28 --> 950.04]  This really looks like a game changer.
[950.14 --> 952.48]  Like, I'm somewhat interested in the Surface Pro 4.
[952.56 --> 957.84]  As you guys know, I wasn't a huge fan of the Surface Pro 3, and this looks like very much
[957.84 --> 959.44]  an iterative improvement.
[960.08 --> 965.84]  Surface Book, on the other hand, though, that could be a game changer.
[965.84 --> 968.18]  I think that's what people in chat were kind of looking for.
[968.18 --> 969.48]  And I understand that, too.
[969.62 --> 969.82]  Yeah.
[969.96 --> 973.20]  13.5-inch display, 267 pixels per inch.
[973.26 --> 974.96]  That is one high-resolution screen.
[975.60 --> 978.70]  Pixel Sense for touch, 6th generation Skylake processor.
[979.28 --> 981.60]  Latest generation NVIDIA GeForce GPU.
[981.74 --> 982.72]  They're being very coy.
[982.88 --> 983.40]  I hate that.
[983.46 --> 985.04]  About the graphics processor in it.
[986.04 --> 991.84]  Apparently, Microsoft worked with its Xbox team to tune in graphics performance.
[992.78 --> 993.16]  Okay.
[993.16 --> 996.02]  It's advertised at 12 hours of battery life per charge,
[996.02 --> 1001.24]  and has a dynamic fulcrum hinge that can accept the screen in either direction.
[1001.24 --> 1004.96]  So you can have it turned this way for, like, a laptop, or you can turn it around and use
[1004.96 --> 1005.68]  it as a tablet.
[1006.02 --> 1013.54]  And it starts at $1,500 with the highest-end model at $2,699 with the unnamed NVIDIA GPU.
[1013.54 --> 1018.06]  I am super stoked on this one.
[1018.32 --> 1024.88]  Really excited to see if it throttles because it looks like a really slim, like, very beautiful device,
[1025.06 --> 1028.42]  but maybe thick enough that they actually managed to cool the bloody thing,
[1028.56 --> 1030.50]  unlike the 2015 Retina MacBook.
[1030.86 --> 1031.04]  Yeah.
[1031.04 --> 1035.70]  Which we got literally double the performance out of when we water-cooled it.
[1035.84 --> 1037.54]  So, yeah.
[1037.62 --> 1038.26]  I don't know.
[1038.80 --> 1042.52]  I don't really know what else to say about that other than that I'm stoked.
[1042.52 --> 1044.00]  I think that's about it until we see it.
[1044.04 --> 1044.20]  Yeah.
[1044.26 --> 1045.42]  I'm, like, super stoked.
[1045.64 --> 1047.66]  I've pre-ordered the Core i7 model.
[1048.14 --> 1049.98]  So, yeah!
[1050.72 --> 1053.32]  Facebook has a new universal Windows 10 app.
[1053.52 --> 1056.46]  That's honestly basically all I have to really say there.
[1056.46 --> 1056.96]  Yeah.
[1056.96 --> 1058.64]  Um, yeah.
[1059.00 --> 1062.82]  It'll work on all your Windows 10 platforms, and everyone just uses Windows 10 computers.
[1063.94 --> 1064.74]  So, yeah.
[1065.02 --> 1068.54]  But if you get, like, a tablet or a phone, it'll work on there, too.
[1070.08 --> 1071.32]  It's just so boring.
[1072.22 --> 1072.54]  Yeah.
[1073.18 --> 1076.76]  The Microsoft Band is being positioned as the ultimate fitness device.
[1076.92 --> 1080.14]  Everyone wants to sell you a freaking wearable based on fitness.
[1080.82 --> 1082.32]  How many people actually work out?
[1082.82 --> 1085.34]  Think about how much money you make out of that.
[1085.34 --> 1089.78]  And honestly, so many of them are useless.
[1090.62 --> 1091.28]  I know.
[1091.48 --> 1098.12]  If they don't have a heart rate monitor, then don't buy it as a fitness device.
[1098.90 --> 1101.80]  Because there's a huge amount of stuff that can count your steps.
[1102.48 --> 1107.68]  Like, you can get, like, a couple dollar things that you just reset every day that can count your steps.
[1107.86 --> 1110.46]  And you don't have to spend, like, hundreds of dollars on this crap.
[1110.58 --> 1110.92]  I don't know.
[1110.98 --> 1111.46]  You know what?
[1111.60 --> 1114.42]  Austin was saying this, and I think it's pure bullshit.
[1114.42 --> 1116.20]  I mean, I think he believes it.
[1116.30 --> 1118.44]  But, like, for me, it doesn't work at all.
[1118.50 --> 1125.14]  But he was saying one of the things he loves about the Apple Watch is the little fitness tracking bars.
[1125.14 --> 1131.36]  Like, the step tracking and standing bars that are like, hey, you've only done, like, 40% of enough for today.
[1131.42 --> 1132.92]  And every time he looks at it, it's a reminder.
[1133.12 --> 1134.54]  You can get free apps on your phone.
[1134.94 --> 1137.50]  But you don't stare at your phone every time you want to know the time.
[1137.76 --> 1138.56]  Well, okay, you do.
[1138.70 --> 1141.64]  But, okay, just calm down for a second, okay?
[1141.64 --> 1144.66]  You're less likely to see something else.
[1144.72 --> 1150.18]  Because, like, I don't know about you, but Droid Turbo, I straight up do not even have to unlock it to see the time.
[1150.58 --> 1150.70]  I do.
[1150.70 --> 1152.32]  I will legitimately not see anything.
[1152.46 --> 1154.54]  I really like that about Motorola stuff.
[1154.92 --> 1155.16]  Yeah.
[1155.48 --> 1155.70]  Yeah.
[1155.70 --> 1156.22]  It's pretty cool.
[1156.22 --> 1167.12]  If the Droid Turbo 2 doesn't have the proximity sensor and, like, wave to preview my notifications crap, I'd straight up not interested in it.
[1167.24 --> 1168.34]  That was my favorite thing about the phone.
[1168.34 --> 1168.88]  That is a killer.
[1169.02 --> 1171.56]  Also, why isn't everyone doing this?
[1172.74 --> 1173.82]  Jester for flashlight.
[1174.62 --> 1175.50]  I don't even have to think.
[1175.66 --> 1177.16]  Why isn't everybody doing this?
[1177.18 --> 1178.02]  That's really cool.
[1178.22 --> 1180.12]  There's a few little things about that phone that I love.
[1180.68 --> 1183.12]  So, anyway, here, let's do my straw poll results here.
[1183.20 --> 1183.90]  Linus is clean.
[1184.22 --> 1185.94]  Do you even work out, bro?
[1186.22 --> 1195.06]  We've got 32% of you saying yes, with 42% of you saying no, and 27% of you weighing in with turnip throw away your votes.
[1195.32 --> 1196.68]  I mean, this is one of those things.
[1196.76 --> 1202.00]  It's like you're trying to sell wearables to, like, I mean, I guess maybe that's it.
[1202.14 --> 1204.46]  They're not trying to sell them to geeks.
[1204.62 --> 1204.84]  No.
[1205.28 --> 1206.30]  Not specifically.
[1206.72 --> 1207.02]  Yeah.
[1207.48 --> 1211.66]  Because, like, there's a lot of people that buy wearables that aren't geeks.
[1212.70 --> 1212.98]  Okay.
[1213.44 --> 1213.68]  Yeah.
[1213.68 --> 1217.96]  Like, I have friends of mine that aren't geeks that want to get a fitness wearable.
[1218.02 --> 1219.56]  Would they buy a Microsoft band?
[1220.24 --> 1220.92]  It's Microsoft.
[1221.12 --> 1221.76]  Probably not.
[1222.10 --> 1224.10]  But Microsoft is probably trying to get there.
[1224.64 --> 1227.64]  So, it's got an OLED screen, a curved Gorilla Glass display.
[1227.64 --> 1233.64]  Apparently, there are lots of third-party partners like Subway, Starbucks, Twitter, and Uber.
[1233.98 --> 1234.18]  Huh?
[1234.54 --> 1235.56]  Good luck with that.
[1236.02 --> 1237.76]  Run to Subway and run back home.
[1237.76 --> 1242.94]  It can track elevation with the built-in barometer, and it's coming for $249 on October 30th.
[1243.44 --> 1244.00]  And Uber?
[1244.00 --> 1246.62]  I understand it's, like, so you can call a cab, but, like, Uber.
[1246.82 --> 1250.54]  Like, run for a little bit, and then Uber for the rest of your run, and then run back home.
[1251.54 --> 1258.56]  It's like, for Halloween, I'm gonna go as a Microsoft fanboy with my Microsoft band.
[1258.56 --> 1259.24]  Oh, my God.
[1259.28 --> 1260.98]  We have to do something for what?
[1261.78 --> 1262.08]  What?
[1262.34 --> 1263.38]  When does Halloween happen?
[1263.72 --> 1264.84]  On the 31st?
[1264.90 --> 1265.72]  Oh, my goodness.
[1265.80 --> 1266.50]  No, on Saturday.
[1266.66 --> 1267.30]  I was wondering what day.
[1267.52 --> 1267.84]  Oh!
[1268.54 --> 1269.72]  So, we have to do it.
[1269.84 --> 1271.24]  The 30th, the day before.
[1271.38 --> 1271.60]  Yeah?
[1271.96 --> 1272.60]  Is Wancho.
[1272.72 --> 1272.98]  Oh.
[1273.14 --> 1273.96]  We have to do something.
[1274.12 --> 1275.12]  Oh, I don't know what to do.
[1275.18 --> 1276.38]  I'm just so tired lately.
[1276.80 --> 1278.70]  Just tell someone else to figure it out.
[1279.10 --> 1282.12]  Yeah, I guess that is the point of hiring people.
[1282.42 --> 1283.04]  Yeah, Colton.
[1283.88 --> 1284.20]  Colton.
[1284.32 --> 1285.92]  So, this is kind of huge.
[1286.08 --> 1287.90]  Huge price tag, that is.
[1287.90 --> 1288.88]  So sad.
[1289.88 --> 1293.72]  I wanted one so bad, and now there's no way I'm gonna get one.
[1293.94 --> 1296.34]  HoloLens dev kits, $3,000.
[1296.72 --> 1298.28]  I don't even have to look at the doc to know that.
[1298.44 --> 1302.14]  It's just, oh, so expensive.
[1303.26 --> 1308.58]  The kits will apparently be fully untethered, so no cables or connection to a PC is required.
[1308.96 --> 1314.10]  So, you could trade in your PC towards buying that HoloLens dev kit.
[1314.12 --> 1316.10]  I wouldn't even, I don't even think it would cover it.
[1316.16 --> 1316.58]  No, it wouldn't.
[1316.58 --> 1321.18]  And prospective augmented reality devs can put in an application now.
[1321.54 --> 1323.96]  So, the dev kit is coming Q1 of 2016.
[1324.12 --> 1329.46]  We were actually just commenting the other day that the whole HoloLens thing has been extremely quiet lately.
[1329.46 --> 1331.10]  They just completely shut up about it.
[1331.22 --> 1334.04]  And then now they're talking about it, and I want them to shut up again.
[1334.52 --> 1334.84]  Yeah.
[1335.12 --> 1335.54]  Go away.
[1335.78 --> 1336.88]  Figure out a way to make it cheaper.
[1337.06 --> 1337.42]  Go away.
[1338.62 --> 1340.02]  Find some way to make it cheaper.
[1340.02 --> 1342.20]  Apparently, Colton's going to be a Halloween stuff for us.
[1342.26 --> 1343.10]  Okay, good.
[1343.82 --> 1347.12]  Alright, so that's pretty much it for the Microsoft event.
[1347.12 --> 1349.46]  I wish we had more to say about HoloLens.
[1350.12 --> 1354.16]  So, this article is from gatek.edu.
[1354.74 --> 1355.10]  Edu.
[1355.10 --> 1358.88]  Oh, like itch.
[1359.02 --> 1360.28]  Yeah, this is the Georgia Tech site.
[1360.44 --> 1360.64]  Yeah.
[1360.64 --> 1367.14]  Okay, so liquid cooling moves onto the chip for denser electronics.
[1367.76 --> 1370.52]  This is looking like some pretty freaking cool stuff.
[1370.52 --> 1380.00]  So, microfluidic passages cut directly into the backsides of production field programmable gate array devices.
[1380.20 --> 1394.76]  So, FPGA devices could allow better density of transistors and therefore better device performance per size, which could lower costs.
[1394.76 --> 1401.10]  Although, we would need to know how much this costs to implement.
[1401.36 --> 1403.22]  And could improve performance as well.
[1403.30 --> 1410.04]  So, if we're not looking at low-cost devices, then just packing everything in denser could improve performance as well.
[1410.12 --> 1419.64]  To make this, they etched cooling passages into the silicon, incorporating silicon cylinders approximately 100 microns in diameter to improve heat transmission.
[1419.90 --> 1420.20]  Jeez.
[1420.20 --> 1427.40]  So, the information presented on September 28th at the IEEE conference in San Jose, California.
[1428.12 --> 1432.26]  And like all the, like, wow, that's crazy bananas technology.
[1432.58 --> 1438.04]  Stuff that we talk about, we could be looking at years before any of this ever gets implemented.
[1438.22 --> 1439.46]  If any of it ever gets implemented.
[1439.46 --> 1443.30]  When things are presented at IEEE, you see them in a while.
[1443.30 --> 1444.10]  Yeah.
[1445.10 --> 1452.34]  Apparently, with water inlet temperature at approximately 20 degrees Celsius and an inlet flow rate of 147...
[1452.34 --> 1454.70]  You've got to stop putting the thing over what I'm reading.
[1454.82 --> 1455.64]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[1455.70 --> 1456.16]  I'm trying to...
[1456.16 --> 1458.60]  I'm reading along and I'm trying to be an active listener.
[1460.82 --> 1462.76]  147 millimeters per minute.
[1462.76 --> 1463.02]  Milliliters.
[1463.26 --> 1464.34]  Milliliters per minute.
[1464.78 --> 1469.72]  The liquid-cooled FPGA operated at less than 24 degrees Celsius, which is pretty crazy actually.
[1469.72 --> 1470.86]  That is so cool.
[1470.86 --> 1473.10]  They don't talk about...
[1473.10 --> 1475.30]  What that FPGA was doing.
[1475.46 --> 1477.46]  Or what is actually dissipating the heat.
[1477.58 --> 1477.84]  Yeah.
[1478.56 --> 1480.86]  So, like, I don't know...
[1481.70 --> 1488.68]  You know, like, would your motherboard have the liquid cooling radiator for the CPU, like, at the back?
[1488.92 --> 1490.76]  If it's soldered in, maybe?
[1492.18 --> 1494.40]  So, yeah.
[1495.32 --> 1495.62]  Yeah.
[1495.76 --> 1497.34]  We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
[1497.46 --> 1497.64]  Yeah.
[1497.64 --> 1505.38]  I mean, and then, like, to be clear, FPGA is not, like, an Intel CPU.
[1505.76 --> 1506.28]  That would...
[1506.28 --> 1507.96]  Totally different class of device.
[1508.02 --> 1509.80]  That's why I took back my soldered in comment.
[1509.98 --> 1510.16]  Yeah.
[1511.18 --> 1511.92]  All right.
[1512.60 --> 1519.52]  Smartphones can be hacked into with just one text message and then used to spy on the owners.
[1519.52 --> 1529.84]  So, this is according to Edward Snowden, the famous whistleblower for the whole NSA shenanigans thing that's been going on for...
[1529.84 --> 1531.58]  God, it's been over a year now, hasn't it?
[1532.88 --> 1533.28]  Jeez.
[1534.36 --> 1534.84]  All right, so...
[1534.84 --> 1535.90]  Have you heard about his Twitter account?
[1536.82 --> 1537.22]  Sorry?
[1537.34 --> 1539.50]  He made a Twitter account, which was immediately official.
[1539.74 --> 1541.78]  So, this was obviously planned, which is probably smart.
[1541.78 --> 1546.60]  One thing I was wondering about is, does he have a login method just for him?
[1547.56 --> 1547.70]  I don't know.
[1547.70 --> 1549.40]  Does he have a special way to log into Twitter?
[1549.74 --> 1550.14]  I don't know.
[1550.14 --> 1551.06]  I kind of bet you he does.
[1552.10 --> 1554.52]  And I bet you his login is monitored, like, all the time.
[1554.72 --> 1558.36]  Anyways, he had, like, a huge amount of followers already.
[1558.60 --> 1558.74]  Yeah.
[1558.74 --> 1561.56]  He's following one thing, and it's the NSA.
[1561.80 --> 1562.00]  Yeah.
[1562.46 --> 1562.82]  Hilarious.
[1563.18 --> 1564.68]  Anyways, so, yeah.
[1564.76 --> 1568.88]  Apparently, they can be hacked into with just one text message and then used to spy on their owners, as he said.
[1568.88 --> 1576.68]  And the Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ, has a set of tools called the Smurf Suite.
[1577.12 --> 1577.92]  There's...
[1577.92 --> 1579.06]  Which is kind of hilarious.
[1579.20 --> 1579.94]  There's three of them.
[1580.20 --> 1583.22]  First one is Dreamy Smurf, lets the phone be powered on and off.
[1583.46 --> 1588.16]  Nosey Smurf, which lets spies turn the microphone on and listen in, even if the phone is off.
[1588.42 --> 1591.80]  And Paranoid Smurf, which hides the fact that the phone has been taken over.
[1592.42 --> 1598.70]  Apparently, Snowden says that the NSA has spent $1 billion on similar tools.
[1598.88 --> 1600.32]  That's where your taxpayer money's going.
[1601.22 --> 1601.98]  If you're American.
[1602.50 --> 1603.46]  Or UK.
[1603.46 --> 1604.10]  I hope you appreciate that.
[1604.80 --> 1604.92]  Yeah.
[1605.44 --> 1605.72]  Woo!
[1606.48 --> 1606.74]  Yay!
[1606.74 --> 1608.78]  Let's have a tax party.
[1610.34 --> 1611.44]  I think that's what it's called.
[1611.68 --> 1614.18]  We're in the whatever eyes thing.
[1614.34 --> 1615.62]  Probably our tax money, too.
[1615.72 --> 1616.38]  Oh, I know.
[1616.50 --> 1617.74]  I was just being...
[1617.74 --> 1619.98]  I was just being smug about being Canadian.
[1620.16 --> 1621.60]  There's nothing to really be smug about it.
[1621.82 --> 1621.94]  Yeah.
[1622.12 --> 1624.06]  Our tax dollars probably went towards that, as well.
[1624.26 --> 1625.48]  With respect to this, anyway.
[1625.48 --> 1630.54]  Australian researchers make a quantum computing breakthrough.
[1631.08 --> 1633.70]  This is from smh.com.au.
[1634.28 --> 1635.26]  Are you posting the link?
[1635.28 --> 1635.90]  Yeah, I got it.
[1635.98 --> 1636.28]  Okay.
[1637.14 --> 1640.28]  Paving the way for world-first chip.
[1641.66 --> 1643.34]  Ooh, quantum.
[1643.60 --> 1644.26]  It could be a real thing.
[1644.34 --> 1650.90]  Now, okay, again, to be clear, even if a quantum chip existed, you wouldn't be installing it in your home computer.
[1650.90 --> 1651.10]  Yeah.
[1651.10 --> 1651.16]  Yeah.
[1651.16 --> 1655.74]  For a very, very, very long time.
[1655.86 --> 1660.32]  I thought it might be super good once we're able to do that, due to encryption and all this other kind of stuff.
[1662.00 --> 1662.92]  Not for now.
[1662.92 --> 1670.98]  So, basically, until now, this technology has relied on exotic materials to construct quantum computers, making them completely unsuitable for commercial production.
[1671.08 --> 1679.76]  Like, we're talking, like, we have to have it at, like, this, like, hugely sub-zero temperature and, like, maintain it, like, exactly there.
[1679.84 --> 1682.38]  And then, like, it'll do something for a bit.
[1682.38 --> 1684.66]  And, yeah, proof of concept.
[1686.66 --> 1693.28]  But they have apparently patented a way to scale their technology to millions of qubits.
[1693.44 --> 1695.32]  So, that's, like, quantum bits.
[1695.64 --> 1701.14]  Using standard industrial manufacturing techniques to build the world's first quantum processor chip.
[1701.14 --> 1712.90]  So, basically, their patented design modifies the transistors found in regular computer chips to store zero or one on the spin of a single electron, which works like a tiny compass needle.
[1713.36 --> 1717.96]  So, it builds on previous research that produced the first quantum computing transistor of this type.
[1718.06 --> 1718.38]  Interesting.
[1718.52 --> 1726.12]  So, they've demonstrated the first time that we can do the first quantum calculation on a silicon chip working with two of these quantum bits.
[1726.74 --> 1729.22]  So, stay tuned, I guess.
[1729.22 --> 1737.86]  And, to be clear, quantum computing is not going to be, like, the be-all and end-all of, oh, now we can do, like, way better 3D graphics for gaming.
[1738.44 --> 1741.68]  But it's great for things like Luke was saying, like encryption, for example.
[1741.86 --> 1743.18]  Way faster for that.
[1743.54 --> 1744.14]  This is kind of—
[1744.14 --> 1748.18]  And, like, the idea is if you mess with the data, it will change the data.
[1748.44 --> 1753.18]  So, if you try to read it and you're the wrong person, I believe, it will actually change what the data is.
[1753.54 --> 1756.90]  So, if someone tries to break into your encrypted whatever, it won't matter.
[1756.90 --> 1760.52]  It will suck, because if you try to read it later on, it will be changed.
[1761.32 --> 1766.74]  But it's kind of like the idea of, like, having your phone wipe itself if it gets read too many times.
[1766.82 --> 1766.96]  Yeah.
[1767.14 --> 1768.36]  That's actually a good thing.
[1768.66 --> 1770.90]  I had to turn that feature off, because I have children.
[1771.72 --> 1772.08]  Yes.
[1772.82 --> 1773.22]  Yes.
[1773.46 --> 1777.78]  I've had someone, like, grab my phone and they're just like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do, and fail a whole bunch of logins.
[1777.82 --> 1779.76]  I'm like, no, stop, please.
[1780.12 --> 1781.18]  What are you doing?
[1781.18 --> 1781.58]  Yeah.
[1782.82 --> 1788.40]  So, to get some idea of why that is, I mean, look at CPUs and GPUs.
[1788.54 --> 1792.88]  How they are much better for—hold on a second.
[1793.12 --> 1798.80]  How they're much better for specific workloads than each other, not because, like, one is better and the other is worse,
[1798.92 --> 1801.66]  but because they're optimized for different workloads.
[1801.92 --> 1806.90]  So, I'm going to go ahead and fire up this article from the BBC, and Luke is going to handle this people topic.
[1806.90 --> 1807.90]  Okay.
[1807.90 --> 1808.12]  Okay.
[1808.72 --> 1809.78]  Didn't see that coming.
[1811.36 --> 1815.58]  And, yes, I know that's not exactly how quantum encryption works.
[1816.74 --> 1817.62]  Give me a break.
[1818.12 --> 1819.52]  It's actually not a bad representation.
[1819.72 --> 1820.36]  You can go look it up.
[1821.10 --> 1827.46]  If you want to know more about quantum anything, you should probably look more deeply into it than, like, a couple-second description on a land show.
[1828.26 --> 1829.38]  People sites disappear.
[1829.50 --> 1830.94]  Creator is still moving ahead with release.
[1831.02 --> 1831.86]  That is what he opened, right?
[1832.12 --> 1832.42]  Yes.
[1832.42 --> 1836.94]  So, the People website is inaccessible for many, so I'm just getting a landing page.
[1837.06 --> 1840.80]  Social outlets such as People's Twitter and People's Facebook pages have been taken down,
[1840.92 --> 1848.54]  but co-creator Julia Cordray is still planning to release the app, pushing its release date from November to next week.
[1848.90 --> 1852.80]  Probably just because how much people have been talking about it, you've got to jump on that hype train as much as you can.
[1853.26 --> 1858.78]  Adjustments to the app include individuals cannot be reviewed without their permission, which is probably a good idea.
[1858.78 --> 1864.54]  No way to make a negative review at all, apparently, and a review must be approved before it is posted.
[1865.14 --> 1870.36]  So, basically, it's just going to be a circle jerk of everyone telling each other that they're great because nothing else is going to get approved,
[1870.92 --> 1873.48]  unless people want to be self-deprecating about it.
[1874.36 --> 1882.06]  Emily Laidlaw, a University Calgary assistant law professor, says the app could potentially have huge legal ramifications for its creators,
[1882.28 --> 1883.76]  which is super not surprising.
[1883.76 --> 1891.52]  She also states that in Canada, if you run an app or you're hosting a website and you are informed that you're carrying content that is defamatory,
[1892.12 --> 1898.70]  you now have knowledge and you have control, so you risk liability if you don't take the content down.
[1903.34 --> 1908.00]  That being said, they probably won't run or host it in Canada.
[1908.00 --> 1911.36]  So, that probably doesn't matter, but they could.
[1911.54 --> 1917.00]  There is actually one good hosting company in Canada that I know of, maybe a few more than that.
[1917.82 --> 1919.14]  So, who knows?
[1919.42 --> 1919.90]  I don't know.
[1920.24 --> 1921.56]  I can't really open another topic.
[1922.08 --> 1924.60]  So, let me try.
[1926.78 --> 1927.84]  Give me one second.
[1928.40 --> 1931.56]  What we're going to talk about, as Linus comes back,
[1931.56 --> 1934.70]  Can you open that topic?
[1934.84 --> 1936.02]  It's hard, like, around the mic.
[1936.36 --> 1937.02]  Which one?
[1937.14 --> 1937.34]  Japan?
[1937.42 --> 1938.08]  Japan one, yes.
[1938.08 --> 1939.52]  Oh, that is so cool!
[1940.48 --> 1942.10]  Yeah, I'm, like, super stoked on this.
[1942.22 --> 1947.38]  So, Japan display, 8K, 17-inch LCD.
[1948.54 --> 1948.94]  Bam!
[1951.18 --> 1952.46]  Why are you super stoked on that?
[1952.98 --> 1953.68]  I don't know, that's cool.
[1954.50 --> 1959.74]  Can you tell the difference between a 4K screen at that size?
[1961.56 --> 1962.20]  Um...
[1962.20 --> 1965.44]  Maybe.
[1966.38 --> 1967.40]  Yeah, yeah, probably.
[1967.52 --> 1968.20]  4K and 8K?
[1968.68 --> 1972.10]  Yeah, I, I, well, okay, uh, if you get close enough.
[1972.20 --> 1974.64]  To be fair, I heard you talking and didn't read it and heard 7-inch,
[1974.84 --> 1976.50]  and was like, why does he care?
[1976.88 --> 1978.14]  17-inch makes a little bit more sense.
[1978.14 --> 1978.74]  Oh, yes.
[1978.96 --> 1979.16]  Yeah.
[1979.26 --> 1980.14]  Yeah, 17-inch.
[1980.20 --> 1982.02]  I mean, to be clear, okay, okay.
[1982.60 --> 1983.66]  Like, the...
[1983.66 --> 1983.94]  Okay.
[1984.50 --> 1985.56]  Like, it...
[1985.56 --> 1989.42]  Okay, it's just cool because it's, like, nerdy cool.
[1989.42 --> 1992.86]  Yeah, it's cool because it's 510 PPI on a 17-inch screen.
[1993.32 --> 1993.72]  Yeah.
[1994.12 --> 1994.72]  That's pretty bad.
[1994.76 --> 1997.26]  I mean, this isn't groundbreaking pixels per inch, even.
[1997.44 --> 2001.52]  Like, Sony's upcoming Xperia Z5 is gonna be, like, 700 or something like that.
[2001.52 --> 2002.58]  But that's not 17 inches.
[2002.58 --> 2011.50]  But it's not 17 inches, and it's a mere 4K display, so it's actually one quarter as many pixels as they've managed to build here.
[2011.64 --> 2014.84]  I gotta wonder, how much does it cost them to build this thing?
[2015.08 --> 2016.14]  This is cool, though.
[2016.14 --> 2022.12]  So, the module can actually run at a refresh rate of 120 hertz.
[2022.12 --> 2028.46]  I don't know what they're using to drive this thing because there's no display...
[2028.46 --> 2035.58]  There's no off-the-shelf display interface in existence that can drive 8K at 60 hertz, let alone 120 hertz.
[2036.30 --> 2036.50]  That...
[2036.50 --> 2037.16]  And I'm talking...
[2037.16 --> 2043.12]  Obviously, there's other stuff that exists, but I'm talking, like, you know, your HDMI or your DisplayPort or...
[2043.12 --> 2046.40]  Heaven forbid, DVI or whatever else the case may be.
[2046.88 --> 2049.44]  So, I have no idea what they're using to drive this thing.
[2049.44 --> 2055.04]  In fact, I've been tempted at CES sometimes to be like, okay, so that's an 8K TV.
[2055.50 --> 2056.98]  You're playing back some 8K content.
[2057.86 --> 2059.62]  Can I see what's behind here?
[2059.80 --> 2061.62]  Like, what is plugged into this?
[2062.54 --> 2063.86]  How are you running this?
[2063.90 --> 2070.10]  Like, it must just be, like, a proprietary flash-based, like, direct-to-the-display interface or something.
[2070.40 --> 2072.46]  Could you build it as memory into the display?
[2073.64 --> 2074.08]  Maybe.
[2074.96 --> 2075.40]  Maybe.
[2075.80 --> 2076.56]  I don't know.
[2076.56 --> 2082.98]  Like, if you actually used RAM, like, if you just had, like, flash-based storage that loaded it into RAM that interfaced directly with the display.
[2083.04 --> 2085.24]  Like, I have no idea how they're driving.
[2085.32 --> 2087.50]  Like, 8K.
[2087.66 --> 2088.40]  Okay, so hold on.
[2088.70 --> 2090.24]  8K resolution.
[2090.70 --> 2091.76]  Let's find out what that is.
[2091.80 --> 2095.04]  So, that's 7680 by 4320.
[2095.04 --> 2095.94]  Okay.
[2096.60 --> 2098.26]  So, calculator.
[2100.52 --> 2100.96]  What?
[2101.60 --> 2101.80]  What?
[2102.18 --> 2103.78]  Why are these things happening to me?
[2105.40 --> 2105.88]  Calculator.
[2106.00 --> 2106.22]  Okay.
[2106.36 --> 2109.00]  So, 7680.
[2109.82 --> 2110.22]  RCA?
[2111.14 --> 2111.58]  Time.
[2111.78 --> 2112.26]  No.
[2112.56 --> 2112.96]  I know.
[2113.04 --> 2113.94]  A bunch of people are saying that.
[2114.02 --> 2114.44]  No.
[2114.76 --> 2115.34]  I can't do it.
[2115.46 --> 2115.90]  No.
[2116.58 --> 2117.82]  Many people are saying that.
[2117.90 --> 2118.58]  Why would that work?
[2118.58 --> 2121.38]  So, this is 33 megapixels.
[2121.92 --> 2122.92]  Like, think about it.
[2122.96 --> 2127.18]  If you're, like, a DSLR photographer, so you take high-resolution photos.
[2127.24 --> 2129.80]  Even then, you're not taking 33 megapixel photos.
[2130.04 --> 2135.04]  How long it takes just to, like, open one of them on your computer.
[2135.04 --> 2139.22]  So, we're talking 120 of those per second.
[2140.02 --> 2141.16]  Freaking bananas.
[2143.50 --> 2145.02]  Sometimes I don't really understand.
[2145.18 --> 2146.16]  Is this a Colton thing?
[2146.50 --> 2154.88]  Like, how that gets classified as a main topic and, like, other stuff gets classified as, like, a rapid-fire topic.
[2154.94 --> 2155.48]  I don't know.
[2155.74 --> 2158.04]  I often do not really understand the logic.
[2158.16 --> 2161.30]  Because there's nothing to really say other than, like, that looks bananas.
[2161.58 --> 2163.92]  I guess I'll enjoy it in about four or five years.
[2163.92 --> 2165.22]  We're still saying RCA.
[2165.78 --> 2167.02]  The Twitch chat is great.
[2169.52 --> 2173.98]  Also, I can't believe that you didn't think of having 60 different VGA connections together.
[2175.80 --> 2176.24]  What?
[2176.34 --> 2176.72]  Why not?
[2177.30 --> 2178.42]  Yeah, that's probably it.
[2178.52 --> 2178.74]  Why not?
[2178.80 --> 2179.18]  All right.
[2179.24 --> 2182.16]  So, the Dell XPS lineup has been refreshed.
[2182.44 --> 2184.76]  Oh, we haven't been saying who's been posting stuff on the forum.
[2184.92 --> 2185.12]  Wow.
[2185.18 --> 2186.64]  So, this is from SirSquid.
[2186.78 --> 2188.72]  The Japan display one is from Goodbytes.
[2188.80 --> 2191.80]  The people site disappearing is from StuartT211.
[2191.80 --> 2194.96]  The Australian researchers with the quantum computer thing is Kill Comic.
[2195.30 --> 2198.70]  Smartphones being hacked into with just one text message comes from Cyborg Warrior.
[2199.30 --> 2202.94]  And liquid cooling moving onto the chip is from Numpad.
[2203.98 --> 2204.68]  All right.
[2204.82 --> 2210.02]  So, I am sort of stoked on certain things and super stoked on others.
[2210.12 --> 2215.96]  So, the things I mostly don't give a crap about are the XPS 13 Refresh and XPS 15.
[2215.96 --> 2221.04]  So, I guess they have slim bezels, which is cool.
[2221.14 --> 2221.68]  That is cool.
[2221.86 --> 2222.44]  It's cool.
[2222.52 --> 2227.00]  But the old XPS 13 that they announced at CES this year had really slim bezels.
[2227.06 --> 2227.58]  I reviewed it.
[2227.58 --> 2228.04]  It was nice.
[2228.16 --> 2230.50]  The old one that they announced at CES this year.
[2230.50 --> 2231.36]  Well, whatever.
[2231.58 --> 2235.68]  I mean, the slightly less new one.
[2236.28 --> 2237.82]  Whatever you want to call it.
[2237.82 --> 2243.40]  So, the 13 and 15 are getting updated processors and packing more storage into their thin frames.
[2243.88 --> 2246.00]  Finally, they're available with 16 gigs of RAM.
[2246.58 --> 2248.04]  I definitely care about that.
[2248.36 --> 2249.14]  I ripped on the X...
[2249.14 --> 2249.98]  It seems to be a universal thing.
[2250.32 --> 2255.30]  I ripped on the 13 so hard for only going up to 8 gigs of RAM,
[2255.40 --> 2257.78]  considering how much money was getting spent on that computer.
[2258.26 --> 2264.10]  There's an optional NVIDIA GDDR5 GPU that can be added to the notebook.
[2264.24 --> 2265.32]  So, they're being coy again.
[2265.32 --> 2274.84]  So, NVIDIA basically is like, yeah, you can announce it, but don't tell people what it is.
[2275.02 --> 2275.52]  Or whatever.
[2275.64 --> 2277.76]  I'm trying to do like a...
[2277.76 --> 2278.86]  It was supposed to be a cigar.
[2279.04 --> 2280.14]  I think that came off as weed.
[2280.38 --> 2281.30]  Yeah, whatever.
[2281.74 --> 2283.68]  I screwed up the pan thing.
[2283.72 --> 2284.86]  Yeah, I made an effort.
[2285.94 --> 2287.32]  I think it's a cigar like...
[2288.32 --> 2288.68]  Maybe.
[2290.24 --> 2290.72]  Cigarette?
[2290.92 --> 2291.48]  No, but that's both.
[2291.58 --> 2293.08]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2293.14 --> 2294.34]  You got to make sure it's big.
[2294.34 --> 2296.56]  Yeah, I didn't make sure it was big enough.
[2296.66 --> 2299.54]  I mean, that could just be like a really big...
[2299.54 --> 2300.60]  That's true.
[2301.50 --> 2302.50]  I mean, that would...
[2302.50 --> 2303.78]  When the blunt's too strong.
[2303.84 --> 2306.82]  Yeah, that would be totally, totally, totally big.
[2307.20 --> 2310.56]  But then, like you were saying earlier in the show, it can never be too big around.
[2311.70 --> 2313.68]  Circumference, diameter, these are good things.
[2313.68 --> 2318.00]  So, I can have up to one terabyte of PCI Express-based storage.
[2318.72 --> 2321.90]  And, I don't know, they still have webcams on the bottom of the screen, which is kind
[2321.90 --> 2325.54]  of a bummer if you have like kind of an upturned nose and you don't want people looking at your
[2325.54 --> 2326.60]  brain while they talk to you.
[2326.68 --> 2326.78]  Yeah.
[2327.94 --> 2328.26]  Okay.
[2328.58 --> 2329.64]  But, the XPS 12.
[2329.72 --> 2333.20]  This is the one I care about because I used an XPS 12 for...
[2333.20 --> 2336.92]  Man, it must have been like over a year I was using that as my daily driver.
[2336.92 --> 2338.64]  In fact, Luke's inherited it now.
[2338.76 --> 2338.90]  Yep.
[2339.20 --> 2340.40]  Great little device.
[2340.62 --> 2341.30]  It's been durable.
[2341.54 --> 2343.02]  It's been rained on and survived.
[2343.02 --> 2343.24]  It's really durable.
[2343.56 --> 2345.22]  It's got a great keyboard.
[2345.50 --> 2346.46]  Love that device.
[2346.72 --> 2348.56]  So, it is finally getting an upgrade.
[2349.12 --> 2353.18]  12.5 inch full HD display with an upgrade to a 4K touchscreen.
[2353.98 --> 2357.26]  Two Thunderbolt 3 ports using USB Type-C connectors.
[2357.82 --> 2359.56]  Has support for the Dell Pen if you care.
[2360.14 --> 2364.50]  And Dell is positioning it as a competitor to the Surface Pro 4.
[2364.50 --> 2373.04]  I am super excited because I like the concept of a convertible that doesn't have a kickstand
[2373.04 --> 2377.78]  versus a convertible that does have a kickstand quite a bit more.
[2379.28 --> 2382.46]  Let's see if I can pull up some pictures here.
[2383.22 --> 2384.14]  New XPS 12.
[2384.20 --> 2384.64]  Here we go.
[2384.98 --> 2391.76]  So, it remains to be seen for me if this hinge design is going to light as many fires for me
[2391.76 --> 2394.34]  as the old pinwheel design did.
[2395.12 --> 2396.66]  Actually, we can show that here.
[2397.46 --> 2398.20]  So, check it out.
[2398.28 --> 2399.74]  So, this is the way the old XPS...
[2399.74 --> 2401.22]  Well, we broke it a bit when we dropped it.
[2401.22 --> 2401.94]  We broke it a little bit.
[2402.28 --> 2403.88]  But it usually...
[2403.88 --> 2405.62]  Like, that was a pretty good...
[2405.62 --> 2406.12]  Just...
[2406.12 --> 2408.26]  It popping out doesn't work as well as it used to.
[2408.34 --> 2408.46]  Yeah.
[2408.58 --> 2409.50]  It going back in is...
[2409.50 --> 2411.20]  So, you turn it around, flip it into a tablet.
[2411.40 --> 2413.46]  This one is using a bit of a different approach here.
[2414.12 --> 2415.76]  But, yeah.
[2415.76 --> 2419.70]  So, it's like actually disconnecting and reconnecting.
[2419.76 --> 2423.40]  But I still like that better than I like the whole kickstand thing
[2423.40 --> 2425.48]  because the kickstand is so inflexible.
[2425.62 --> 2429.74]  Like, if you're not sitting on a table, it's kind of inconvenient.
[2429.88 --> 2431.52]  Like, even sitting on an airplane, which is like...
[2431.52 --> 2431.86]  Very inconvenient.
[2432.06 --> 2433.02]  I hate kickstands.
[2433.18 --> 2434.28]  Which is like...
[2434.28 --> 2438.36]  If I was going to pitch, you know, who is the Surface Pro designed for,
[2438.42 --> 2440.08]  I would go, okay, you know, maybe the traveler.
[2440.08 --> 2444.92]  But the airline trays are so slim that you can't actually put your keyboard
[2444.92 --> 2446.12]  and the kickstand on the back of it.
[2446.44 --> 2449.40]  The good news is that I did discover that you can kind of lean it against the seat
[2449.40 --> 2453.12]  in front of you, but it's definitely not as secure.
[2453.30 --> 2453.86]  That's not great.
[2453.96 --> 2455.02]  I wouldn't trust it as much.
[2456.54 --> 2458.30]  This is huge.
[2458.48 --> 2462.76]  Original article here from The Verge posted by Rune on the forum.
[2464.42 --> 2469.60]  Volvo says it will take the blame if one of its self-driving cars
[2469.60 --> 2470.28]  just crashes.
[2470.38 --> 2473.40]  So does this mean you wouldn't have to have insurance?
[2474.04 --> 2474.34]  No.
[2475.00 --> 2476.52]  I think you would still need insurance,
[2476.52 --> 2480.98]  but I think your insurance company would go to Volvo for the claim.
[2481.46 --> 2484.74]  So it'll likely be like a convoluted process.
[2484.92 --> 2487.96]  I'd imagine there's all kinds of legal ramifications here,
[2488.08 --> 2489.50]  like from one country to another,
[2489.64 --> 2491.88]  this might be implemented somewhat differently.
[2493.54 --> 2495.82]  But basically, up until now,
[2495.82 --> 2498.26]  no one's been willing to step up and say,
[2498.40 --> 2501.00]  okay, if an automated car,
[2501.08 --> 2502.66]  running in autonomous mode, by the way,
[2502.74 --> 2503.74]  if you crash it,
[2503.78 --> 2505.18]  they're not taking responsibility for it.
[2505.24 --> 2506.38]  Right, so you'd have to have insurance
[2506.38 --> 2507.62]  because there's manual mode.
[2507.68 --> 2507.88]  Yes.
[2508.24 --> 2510.24]  So running in autonomous mode,
[2510.34 --> 2512.32]  no one has really stepped up and said,
[2512.42 --> 2512.94]  okay, yes,
[2513.00 --> 2514.62]  we will take responsibility for this,
[2514.72 --> 2515.96]  whether it's your Google
[2515.96 --> 2517.60]  or your car manufacturer
[2517.60 --> 2518.76]  or your insurance company
[2518.76 --> 2520.28]  or, I mean, the owner.
[2520.28 --> 2523.46]  As sort of a driver,
[2523.62 --> 2524.40]  I would kind of go,
[2524.72 --> 2526.08]  well, shoot, you know,
[2526.14 --> 2527.22]  like, I don't,
[2527.40 --> 2528.38]  if I make a mistake.
[2528.40 --> 2529.74]  Even though I'm probably not as good
[2529.74 --> 2530.74]  as a self-driving car,
[2530.82 --> 2532.90]  I would rather take responsibility
[2532.90 --> 2534.16]  for my own actions
[2534.16 --> 2535.36]  instead of the possibility
[2535.36 --> 2537.04]  of taking responsibility for one another's.
[2537.30 --> 2537.62]  Yes.
[2538.22 --> 2538.68]  Thank you.
[2538.80 --> 2539.74]  That was very succinct.
[2540.10 --> 2540.28]  Yeah.
[2540.78 --> 2541.84]  So it's frustrating,
[2541.90 --> 2542.92]  and that's a huge problem
[2542.92 --> 2544.02]  with self-driving cars in general.
[2544.10 --> 2544.98]  So it's cool that these guys
[2544.98 --> 2545.88]  are actually standing up.
[2546.26 --> 2547.90]  I would like to see everyone else,
[2547.90 --> 2550.04]  everyone else that's making self-driving cars
[2550.04 --> 2550.76]  do the same thing,
[2550.98 --> 2552.92]  although proving that it was properly
[2552.92 --> 2554.38]  in self-driving mode
[2554.38 --> 2557.18]  could prove to be difficult.
[2557.28 --> 2558.08]  They also said
[2558.08 --> 2560.46]  they want hacking a car
[2560.46 --> 2562.86]  turned into a criminal offense.
[2563.06 --> 2564.80]  I don't think they'll have a problem doing that,
[2564.90 --> 2567.42]  but they also need to properly defend their own cars.
[2567.70 --> 2567.90]  Yes.
[2568.06 --> 2569.18]  We saw this problem with Jeep
[2569.18 --> 2569.82]  and all that kind of stuff.
[2569.88 --> 2571.42]  The only ones doing it properly right now
[2571.42 --> 2572.00]  are Tesla.
[2572.00 --> 2573.86]  If everyone takes the same stance as Tesla,
[2574.04 --> 2574.98]  I'd be okay with that,
[2575.06 --> 2576.70]  but if people just leave giant holes
[2576.70 --> 2577.96]  in the security of their vehicles
[2577.96 --> 2578.52]  and they go like,
[2578.60 --> 2579.54]  well, it's illegal.
[2579.56 --> 2580.06]  It's illegal.
[2580.18 --> 2581.32]  You probably shouldn't do it.
[2581.74 --> 2583.10]  Then that's still not okay.
[2583.48 --> 2583.70]  Yeah.
[2585.46 --> 2586.36]  I think that's about it.
[2586.54 --> 2587.56]  Yeah, I think that's about it for that.
[2587.60 --> 2588.24]  Why don't we do sponsors?
[2588.68 --> 2588.94]  Yes.
[2589.14 --> 2591.38]  So we've actually got a couple sponsors today.
[2591.56 --> 2593.54]  One is squarespace.com,
[2593.62 --> 2594.70]  the place to go to...
[2595.96 --> 2596.56]  Build it beautiful.
[2596.62 --> 2597.20]  Thank you, Luke.
[2597.58 --> 2598.40]  So basically,
[2598.56 --> 2600.22]  Squarespace allows you to use
[2600.22 --> 2603.70]  one of their many very flexible templates.
[2604.44 --> 2604.84]  And beautiful.
[2604.84 --> 2605.86]  And thank you.
[2605.98 --> 2607.02]  And beautiful templates
[2607.02 --> 2608.36]  to create your blog
[2608.36 --> 2610.54]  or your store
[2610.54 --> 2611.84]  or your portfolio
[2612.46 --> 2614.12]  or whatever the case may be.
[2614.82 --> 2615.36]  And then...
[2615.36 --> 2615.96]  Or show off your beauty.
[2616.22 --> 2616.68]  Thank you.
[2616.76 --> 2617.84]  They handle the...
[2618.44 --> 2620.00]  That could be a blog or a portfolio.
[2620.24 --> 2620.34]  It could.
[2620.80 --> 2621.12]  Both.
[2621.40 --> 2623.38]  My portfolio would show off my beauty.
[2623.62 --> 2624.08]  It would.
[2624.40 --> 2624.96]  Yes, it would.
[2624.98 --> 2625.76]  It probably does.
[2625.90 --> 2626.64]  It probably does.
[2626.96 --> 2627.86]  So basically,
[2627.98 --> 2628.84]  they handle the hosting.
[2629.04 --> 2630.26]  If you sign up for a year,
[2630.44 --> 2631.38]  they include a domain
[2631.38 --> 2633.60]  and they've got 24-7 tech support
[2633.60 --> 2636.02]  via live chat and email.
[2636.30 --> 2638.84]  You unfortunately probably can't get beautiful.com.
[2639.04 --> 2640.28]  That domain is probably taken.
[2640.50 --> 2640.84]  Yeah.
[2643.24 --> 2644.44]  Why are you even here?
[2644.56 --> 2645.40]  Why are you even here?
[2645.40 --> 2646.34]  Why are you even here?
[2646.38 --> 2647.88]  That's the beauty of the whole question.
[2648.00 --> 2648.30]  All right.
[2648.38 --> 2649.92]  So visit squarespace.com
[2649.92 --> 2651.04]  and use offer code Linus
[2651.04 --> 2653.16]  to save 10% today
[2653.16 --> 2656.04]  and start creating your beautiful website.
[2656.18 --> 2656.54]  Thank you.
[2657.12 --> 2658.56]  Our next sponsor, FreshBooks.
[2658.64 --> 2659.16]  You know what?
[2659.70 --> 2661.12]  I don't remember if it was you
[2661.12 --> 2662.24]  I was talking to about this,
[2662.32 --> 2663.64]  but I finally clued in
[2663.64 --> 2665.40]  to why FreshBooks sponsors us.
[2665.90 --> 2666.62]  Because I was like,
[2667.78 --> 2669.96]  who in our audience is like,
[2670.10 --> 2671.62]  wow, I need accounting software
[2671.62 --> 2673.50]  because I run a small business?
[2673.76 --> 2674.32]  Was it you?
[2674.76 --> 2675.12]  No.
[2675.30 --> 2675.50]  Okay.
[2675.50 --> 2676.62]  I would counter argue
[2676.62 --> 2677.82]  potentially a lot of them.
[2678.02 --> 2678.24]  Well, yeah.
[2678.36 --> 2679.66]  Because maybe it was Nick.
[2679.66 --> 2680.38]  Because he was like,
[2680.78 --> 2682.22]  how many people in your audience
[2682.22 --> 2683.14]  do you think are running
[2683.14 --> 2685.30]  a small-time computer repair business?
[2685.46 --> 2685.66]  Yeah.
[2685.80 --> 2687.08]  And I was like, oh, yeah.
[2687.30 --> 2688.24]  I feel like we've talked about this
[2688.24 --> 2688.86]  on the WAN show.
[2689.20 --> 2690.24]  Oh, maybe we have.
[2690.68 --> 2691.22]  Well, whatever.
[2691.46 --> 2692.34]  The last time there was a sponsor,
[2692.48 --> 2692.84]  I was like,
[2692.92 --> 2694.60]  tons of you would be interested in this
[2694.60 --> 2696.06]  because small-time computer repair
[2696.06 --> 2696.92]  or computer building
[2696.92 --> 2697.84]  or IT work
[2697.84 --> 2699.56]  or, or, or, or.
[2699.58 --> 2700.30]  So the point is,
[2700.38 --> 2701.82]  FreshBooks is a cloud-based
[2701.82 --> 2703.24]  accounting software
[2703.24 --> 2705.42]  that allows you to track your jobs,
[2705.74 --> 2706.70]  track your hours,
[2707.14 --> 2708.98]  submit bills to your customers,
[2708.98 --> 2710.66]  and have them pay you
[2710.66 --> 2712.02]  via credit card.
[2712.10 --> 2713.30]  You can actually even see
[2713.30 --> 2715.14]  once they've opened the bill,
[2715.30 --> 2716.68]  which is great to know.
[2716.86 --> 2717.06]  So it-
[2717.06 --> 2718.12]  That is actually really cool.
[2718.18 --> 2719.06]  It really is.
[2719.06 --> 2720.62]  It takes away excuses
[2720.62 --> 2722.20]  and lets you focus on
[2722.20 --> 2724.10]  actually doing the repair work
[2724.10 --> 2725.24]  or, or plumbing
[2725.24 --> 2726.22]  or whatever industry
[2726.22 --> 2727.30]  you happen to be in
[2727.30 --> 2728.88]  that you want to be doing
[2728.88 --> 2730.94]  so you are earning money.
[2730.94 --> 2732.40]  You can access it from anywhere
[2732.40 --> 2733.82]  and you can try it out
[2733.82 --> 2734.68]  for free today
[2734.68 --> 2736.26]  at freshbooks.com
[2736.26 --> 2736.96]  slash
[2736.96 --> 2739.86]  when.
[2740.64 --> 2743.18]  And we have a new sponsor today.
[2743.64 --> 2745.34]  Logitech has us showing off.
[2745.44 --> 2747.58]  I actually haven't done my review yet,
[2747.66 --> 2749.34]  so you're the only one sitting here
[2749.34 --> 2750.78]  who has actually used it,
[2750.84 --> 2751.90]  but they've got us showing off
[2751.90 --> 2755.70]  the G633 Artemis Spectrum headset.
[2755.70 --> 2758.18]  It features 7.1 Dolby surround sound
[2758.18 --> 2759.64]  with Logitech gaming software,
[2760.04 --> 2762.30]  40mm Pro-G audio drivers,
[2762.78 --> 2763.78]  it's compatible with the PC
[2763.78 --> 2765.84]  as well as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
[2765.98 --> 2767.70]  and it has adjustable RGB lighting
[2767.70 --> 2768.84]  with custom tags.
[2768.96 --> 2769.82]  One thing that I have to say
[2769.82 --> 2772.00]  is the, with Logitech gaming software
[2772.00 --> 2773.18]  with the Dolby surround sound thing,
[2773.44 --> 2774.82]  what I do actually like about that
[2774.82 --> 2776.20]  is that it has Dolby surround sound
[2776.20 --> 2776.96]  and DTS,
[2777.56 --> 2779.56]  and you can have either one of them on
[2779.56 --> 2781.44]  or you can have them off.
[2782.22 --> 2783.80]  Because I do know that there's some people
[2783.80 --> 2784.98]  that wouldn't want that
[2784.98 --> 2786.16]  touching their sound.
[2786.34 --> 2786.48]  Yep.
[2786.70 --> 2787.94]  So you can just turn it off.
[2788.22 --> 2789.88]  So that's a good thing,
[2789.98 --> 2791.10]  but if you think it's a bad thing,
[2791.16 --> 2792.02]  you can just turn it off,
[2792.08 --> 2792.86]  which makes it a good thing.
[2793.32 --> 2794.24]  I just wanted to clarify that.
[2794.88 --> 2795.60]  Good job.
[2795.82 --> 2796.08]  Yay.
[2796.24 --> 2797.34]  There's a couple other things
[2797.34 --> 2798.68]  that I've already observed about it.
[2798.72 --> 2800.40]  I did get hands-on with it,
[2800.44 --> 2801.88]  although I didn't get to listen to it,
[2801.92 --> 2803.32]  unfortunately, at PAX.
[2803.76 --> 2805.00]  And it's that they actually,
[2805.42 --> 2808.18]  just, they took a common sense approach,
[2808.40 --> 2809.82]  which seems like the kind of thing
[2809.82 --> 2812.92]  that I shouldn't really have to say is amazing.
[2813.02 --> 2814.34]  It's not super common
[2814.34 --> 2815.40]  with gaming headsets, though.
[2815.46 --> 2815.92]  I know.
[2815.94 --> 2817.44]  So it's a point that is good to make.
[2817.46 --> 2819.36]  But the ear cups are actually designed
[2819.36 --> 2821.28]  in like the shape of a human ear,
[2821.48 --> 2824.26]  as opposed to whatever types of ears are round,
[2824.66 --> 2825.88]  like perfect circles.
[2826.08 --> 2826.36]  To be fair,
[2826.48 --> 2828.68]  he doesn't mean like they exactly
[2828.68 --> 2829.68]  follow the shape of a human ear,
[2829.74 --> 2831.00]  but like they're more vertical.
[2831.28 --> 2832.76]  Yeah, they're shaped in somewhat
[2832.76 --> 2833.92]  the shape of a human ear.
[2834.50 --> 2835.78]  So yeah, I actually,
[2835.78 --> 2839.56]  I think this is not our WAN show,
[2839.78 --> 2841.30]  like showcase sample.
[2841.50 --> 2843.22]  This is supposed to be my review sample.
[2843.22 --> 2844.86]  So I'm supposed to be working on a review.
[2845.34 --> 2846.52]  So stay tuned for that.
[2846.56 --> 2847.16]  But in the meantime,
[2847.16 --> 2848.34]  if you guys want to check it out,
[2848.66 --> 2850.44]  there's a link that I posted in the chat.
[2850.50 --> 2851.00]  I'm going to go ahead
[2851.00 --> 2851.92]  and post it one more time.
[2851.94 --> 2853.18]  And if you guys are watching the archive,
[2853.40 --> 2855.08]  then the link is in the video description
[2855.08 --> 2857.48]  to where you can check it out on Amazon.
[2858.74 --> 2859.96]  There's also like a
[2859.96 --> 2861.62]  how they made it video
[2861.62 --> 2863.58]  where I have a very, very short comment
[2863.58 --> 2865.52]  on the end about how I thought they were.
[2865.94 --> 2867.00]  Oh, yeah.
[2867.08 --> 2867.70]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[2867.72 --> 2869.22]  I didn't want to comment on it in depth.
[2869.28 --> 2870.86]  And I'll say basically the same thing here,
[2870.86 --> 2872.98]  which was I didn't have
[2872.98 --> 2874.24]  direct comparative data
[2874.24 --> 2875.78]  to things that I use all the time.
[2875.78 --> 2876.72]  And I didn't have the music
[2876.72 --> 2877.76]  that I use all the time.
[2877.76 --> 2877.98]  Right.
[2878.26 --> 2880.40]  So I can't like very accurately
[2880.40 --> 2881.72]  say exactly how they sound,
[2881.88 --> 2883.92]  but I was pleasantly surprised
[2883.92 --> 2884.70]  for a gaming headset.
[2885.70 --> 2886.28]  And I didn't,
[2886.42 --> 2887.26]  if you put it on
[2887.26 --> 2888.48]  and didn't tell me it was a gaming headset,
[2888.60 --> 2890.34]  which you can hide the mic very well.
[2890.60 --> 2892.12]  So you might have been able to convince me.
[2892.30 --> 2893.36]  I wouldn't have immediately thought
[2893.36 --> 2894.02]  it was a gaming headset,
[2894.28 --> 2896.26]  which is like pretty good praise.
[2896.44 --> 2897.44]  Well, I will be,
[2897.48 --> 2899.14]  I will be pulling out all the headphones.
[2899.24 --> 2899.50]  Yes.
[2899.66 --> 2901.30]  So that's the proper audio review
[2901.30 --> 2901.76]  you should wait for.
[2901.76 --> 2902.36]  So take that.
[2902.98 --> 2903.14]  Yeah.
[2903.80 --> 2904.84]  So this is interesting.
[2904.98 --> 2905.50]  This is actually,
[2905.58 --> 2905.98]  it's funny,
[2906.08 --> 2907.08]  this isn't rapid fire,
[2907.16 --> 2908.12]  but this is the first thing
[2908.12 --> 2909.20]  we've really talked about today
[2909.20 --> 2911.18]  that actually has some discussion
[2911.18 --> 2912.18]  that we can do about it.
[2912.58 --> 2914.26]  The video game voice actors
[2914.26 --> 2915.50]  give the national board
[2915.50 --> 2916.46]  the green light
[2916.46 --> 2918.58]  to vote to strike if needed.
[2919.72 --> 2920.62]  So there you go.
[2920.66 --> 2921.74]  The original article here
[2921.74 --> 2922.84]  is from GameSpot.
[2922.90 --> 2925.08]  And this was an overwhelmingly positive
[2925.08 --> 2926.74]  response to the vote here
[2926.74 --> 2929.18]  with 96.52% of members
[2929.18 --> 2930.26]  voting in favor
[2930.26 --> 2932.20]  of the interactive media agreement
[2932.20 --> 2933.64]  strike authorization referendum.
[2933.76 --> 2935.40]  They only needed 75%
[2935.40 --> 2938.10]  in order for this to get authorized,
[2938.66 --> 2940.14]  or in order to give the national board
[2940.14 --> 2940.88]  that authority.
[2941.48 --> 2942.34]  And so basically,
[2943.02 --> 2944.00]  what they're coming
[2944.00 --> 2946.08]  to the negotiating table with
[2946.08 --> 2947.04]  is,
[2947.46 --> 2948.04]  let's see,
[2948.04 --> 2948.90]  so the original agreement
[2948.90 --> 2950.58]  was signed in the mid-1990s
[2950.58 --> 2952.26]  and is still in effect today
[2952.26 --> 2954.28]  despite very significant
[2954.28 --> 2955.06]  industry changes.
[2955.14 --> 2955.26]  Like,
[2955.30 --> 2955.76]  we're talking
[2955.76 --> 2957.22]  in the days when
[2957.22 --> 2958.30]  a game studio
[2958.30 --> 2958.84]  like,
[2958.94 --> 2959.10]  oh,
[2959.16 --> 2959.56]  I don't know,
[2959.78 --> 2960.14]  Blizzard
[2960.14 --> 2961.20]  would have been
[2961.20 --> 2962.30]  a small company
[2962.30 --> 2964.60]  to now
[2964.60 --> 2966.02]  blockbuster games
[2966.02 --> 2967.42]  getting as much
[2967.42 --> 2968.58]  or more,
[2968.72 --> 2969.40]  if you look at stuff
[2969.40 --> 2970.58]  like Grand Theft Auto 5,
[2970.68 --> 2971.30]  spent on them
[2971.30 --> 2972.92]  compared to a blockbuster movie.
[2973.20 --> 2973.60]  Witcher 3
[2973.60 --> 2974.52]  was 80 million too.
[2974.52 --> 2975.68]  The industry is
[2975.68 --> 2976.18]  very,
[2976.34 --> 2977.24]  very different today
[2977.24 --> 2978.08]  and the board
[2978.08 --> 2978.94]  is basically asking
[2978.94 --> 2980.36]  for a couple of things.
[2980.50 --> 2980.60]  So,
[2980.70 --> 2981.52]  better transparency
[2981.52 --> 2982.98]  in the additioning process
[2982.98 --> 2983.60]  for games
[2983.60 --> 2985.38]  and they're asking for,
[2985.42 --> 2986.82]  I think they're asking for some,
[2986.96 --> 2987.96]  when the parts
[2987.96 --> 2989.10]  that they're doing
[2989.10 --> 2990.34]  are particularly strenuous,
[2990.74 --> 2991.96]  they're asking for limits
[2991.96 --> 2992.70]  to how long
[2992.70 --> 2993.64]  they can work for
[2993.64 --> 2994.84]  at a time
[2994.84 --> 2995.80]  and they're asking
[2995.80 --> 2996.92]  for better compensation
[2996.92 --> 2997.66]  including
[2997.66 --> 2999.56]  a performance bonus
[2999.56 --> 3001.68]  for every 2 million copies
[3001.68 --> 3002.82]  slash subscribers
[3002.82 --> 3004.20]  sold of a game.
[3004.52 --> 3005.20]  So,
[3005.28 --> 3005.74]  that's the part
[3005.74 --> 3006.92]  that I want to talk about
[3006.92 --> 3007.34]  because
[3007.34 --> 3010.88]  who gets
[3010.88 --> 3013.26]  the performance bonus
[3013.26 --> 3014.28]  when something
[3014.28 --> 3016.46]  does really well?
[3016.58 --> 3017.16]  I know
[3017.16 --> 3018.46]  that there have been cases
[3018.46 --> 3019.72]  where actors
[3019.72 --> 3020.54]  have negotiated
[3020.54 --> 3021.30]  such a thing
[3021.30 --> 3022.64]  but it usually
[3022.64 --> 3023.88]  comes along
[3023.88 --> 3024.44]  with
[3024.44 --> 3025.66]  negotiating
[3025.66 --> 3027.36]  for a low salary
[3027.36 --> 3028.66]  to participate
[3028.66 --> 3029.38]  in the project.
[3029.40 --> 3029.80]  I was just going to bring that up.
[3029.90 --> 3030.66]  That's usually
[3030.66 --> 3032.50]  a per case thing.
[3033.00 --> 3033.56]  Usually only
[3033.56 --> 3035.28]  the really big actors
[3035.28 --> 3035.98]  get it
[3035.98 --> 3037.98]  and it's like,
[3038.24 --> 3039.54]  I think probably,
[3039.68 --> 3040.88]  I'd say that it's probably
[3040.88 --> 3041.96]  less common now
[3041.96 --> 3043.80]  due to people seeing
[3043.80 --> 3044.88]  how ridiculously epic
[3044.88 --> 3045.38]  it was.
[3045.62 --> 3045.68]  Like,
[3045.78 --> 3045.98]  didn't,
[3046.32 --> 3048.22]  I'm going to forget his name
[3048.22 --> 3048.80]  which is going to make me
[3048.80 --> 3049.46]  a terrible person,
[3049.56 --> 3050.32]  but the actor that played
[3050.32 --> 3050.82]  Han Solo.
[3051.58 --> 3051.98]  Really?
[3052.30 --> 3053.16]  Harrison Ford.
[3053.24 --> 3054.08]  Didn't Harrison Ford
[3054.08 --> 3054.98]  get a,
[3055.04 --> 3055.32]  like,
[3055.74 --> 3056.68]  the copy sold
[3056.68 --> 3057.46]  whatever agreement
[3057.46 --> 3058.74]  on Star Wars?
[3059.74 --> 3060.14]  Um...
[3060.14 --> 3061.46]  Wasn't that just insane?
[3061.88 --> 3062.32]  Hold on,
[3062.40 --> 3063.12]  I'm not sure,
[3063.24 --> 3063.96]  I'm not sure.
[3064.04 --> 3065.00]  I feel like someone did
[3065.00 --> 3065.28]  in that cast.
[3065.28 --> 3066.60]  I feel like someone did
[3066.60 --> 3067.84]  and I don't remember
[3067.84 --> 3068.38]  who it was.
[3068.48 --> 3069.30]  Someone in Twitch chat
[3069.30 --> 3070.30]  is probably already
[3070.30 --> 3070.94]  telling us.
[3071.02 --> 3071.22]  Well,
[3071.40 --> 3072.90]  in between slaying me
[3072.90 --> 3073.82]  for forgetting his name.
[3073.98 --> 3074.12]  Yeah.
[3074.20 --> 3074.68]  People are like,
[3074.78 --> 3075.38]  oh wow,
[3075.52 --> 3075.86]  wow,
[3075.86 --> 3076.12]  wow,
[3076.12 --> 3076.24]  wow,
[3076.24 --> 3076.86]  wow,
[3076.86 --> 3076.90]  wow,
[3076.90 --> 3076.92]  wow,
[3076.92 --> 3076.96]  wow,
[3076.96 --> 3078.72]  wow,
[3078.80 --> 3079.86]  Luke is dead to me.
[3079.98 --> 3080.98]  He forgot Ford?
[3081.32 --> 3082.12]  Oh wow,
[3082.34 --> 3082.70]  wow,
[3082.84 --> 3083.14]  wow,
[3083.26 --> 3083.52]  wow,
[3083.60 --> 3083.82]  wow.
[3083.90 --> 3084.66]  How does he not know
[3084.66 --> 3084.86]  Harrison Ford?
[3084.86 --> 3085.78]  Luke just lost
[3085.78 --> 3086.76]  all nerd cred.
[3087.48 --> 3088.44]  You are stupid.
[3088.44 --> 3089.18]  I remember the guy's
[3089.18 --> 3090.02]  name on the show.
[3090.28 --> 3091.32]  I remember Han Solo
[3091.32 --> 3092.52]  but I remember Harrison Ford.
[3092.62 --> 3093.66]  Alec Guinness.
[3094.00 --> 3094.64]  Alec Guinness.
[3094.72 --> 3095.90]  It was Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[3096.16 --> 3096.22]  There we go.
[3096.22 --> 3096.84]  He did that.
[3096.96 --> 3097.20]  Okay.
[3097.40 --> 3097.62]  Yeah,
[3097.70 --> 3097.84]  there we go.
[3097.84 --> 3098.50]  And then he made
[3098.50 --> 3099.86]  like huge amounts
[3099.86 --> 3100.44]  of money off of it.
[3100.44 --> 3100.66]  Yeah.
[3101.32 --> 3101.60]  Yeah,
[3101.70 --> 3102.44]  I'm not convinced
[3102.44 --> 3103.48]  he ever worked again.
[3104.76 --> 3105.70]  And apparently Spielberg
[3105.70 --> 3106.90]  also got a royalty cut
[3106.90 --> 3107.40]  from Lucas.
[3107.78 --> 3108.02]  Okay.
[3108.20 --> 3109.06]  So anyway,
[3109.18 --> 3109.96]  the point is,
[3110.32 --> 3111.22]  if the movie does
[3111.22 --> 3111.82]  really well,
[3111.92 --> 3113.24]  that can be very disastrous
[3113.24 --> 3114.78]  for the folks
[3114.78 --> 3116.06]  that are investing
[3116.06 --> 3117.44]  the actual money
[3117.44 --> 3118.64]  into the project.
[3118.86 --> 3119.08]  I mean,
[3119.16 --> 3119.94]  with that said,
[3119.98 --> 3120.64]  it's not like
[3120.64 --> 3121.78]  an investment of time
[3121.78 --> 3123.72]  isn't also an investment
[3123.72 --> 3126.62]  but it gets looked at
[3126.62 --> 3127.70]  a little bit differently
[3127.70 --> 3128.82]  when we're talking about
[3128.82 --> 3130.44]  the actual money
[3130.44 --> 3131.42]  that gets paid out
[3131.42 --> 3132.18]  when the project
[3132.18 --> 3133.78]  gets super successful.
[3134.46 --> 3135.72]  So companies tend
[3135.72 --> 3136.84]  to shy away
[3136.84 --> 3138.54]  from agreements like that
[3138.54 --> 3139.12]  because it means
[3139.12 --> 3140.02]  that they can't really
[3140.02 --> 3141.86]  control their costs
[3141.86 --> 3143.16]  after the fact.
[3143.24 --> 3144.04]  So,
[3144.44 --> 3144.92]  I don't know.
[3145.12 --> 3145.78]  Do you think
[3145.78 --> 3146.44]  it is fair
[3146.44 --> 3147.64]  for voice actors
[3147.64 --> 3150.44]  to ask for royalties
[3150.44 --> 3151.66]  based on how many
[3151.66 --> 3152.38]  copies are sold?
[3152.74 --> 3154.28]  I don't necessarily
[3154.28 --> 3155.72]  think that it's fair
[3155.72 --> 3157.64]  that that is a guarantee
[3157.64 --> 3159.86]  in every single contract.
[3160.52 --> 3161.00]  Right.
[3161.00 --> 3162.10]  I think that it is fair
[3162.10 --> 3162.94]  for them to ask.
[3163.04 --> 3163.70]  I think it is fair
[3163.70 --> 3165.04]  for them to negotiate for.
[3165.28 --> 3165.50]  Right.
[3165.58 --> 3166.64]  I don't know if,
[3166.88 --> 3167.42]  as a company,
[3167.54 --> 3168.46]  I would hire
[3168.46 --> 3169.78]  as many voice actors,
[3169.90 --> 3170.52]  and this is something
[3170.52 --> 3171.04]  I think they need
[3171.04 --> 3171.62]  to realize
[3171.62 --> 3172.68]  if I know
[3172.68 --> 3174.12]  that every single
[3174.12 --> 3175.34]  voice actor that I hire
[3175.34 --> 3176.00]  is going to get
[3176.00 --> 3176.84]  a performance bonus
[3176.84 --> 3177.80]  for every 2 million
[3177.80 --> 3178.50]  copies of the game
[3178.50 --> 3179.04]  that I sell.
[3179.40 --> 3180.08]  And for games
[3180.08 --> 3181.26]  that try to strive
[3181.26 --> 3182.28]  for having every single
[3182.28 --> 3183.06]  one of their characters
[3183.06 --> 3184.36]  having an individual
[3184.36 --> 3185.44]  voice actor,
[3185.64 --> 3187.26]  which is awesome,
[3187.98 --> 3189.02]  that is super cool
[3189.02 --> 3189.74]  when you're playing a game
[3189.74 --> 3190.64]  that everyone you talk to
[3190.64 --> 3191.32]  sounds different.
[3191.46 --> 3191.72]  Right.
[3191.72 --> 3193.08]  I wouldn't want to pay
[3193.08 --> 3194.06]  each individual
[3194.06 --> 3194.52]  one of them out
[3194.52 --> 3196.20]  unless it's like 50 cents per,
[3196.36 --> 3197.04]  which they probably
[3197.04 --> 3198.22]  have some extra lines
[3198.22 --> 3198.96]  saying that it has to be
[3198.96 --> 3199.62]  a certain percentage
[3199.62 --> 3200.02]  or whatever.
[3200.54 --> 3201.72]  So, I don't know.
[3201.82 --> 3202.60]  That makes me a little
[3202.60 --> 3203.10]  bit uneasy,
[3203.68 --> 3205.02]  but I do think
[3205.02 --> 3208.86]  the ability to request it
[3208.86 --> 3209.74]  should be there.
[3209.88 --> 3210.14]  Right.
[3210.52 --> 3210.92]  And I mean,
[3210.98 --> 3211.50]  quite frankly,
[3211.60 --> 3212.90]  that probably already exists.
[3213.06 --> 3213.22]  I mean,
[3213.28 --> 3214.24]  if you're freaking
[3214.24 --> 3215.36]  Samuel L. Jackson
[3215.36 --> 3215.88]  or something,
[3216.00 --> 3216.44]  and you're like,
[3216.60 --> 3217.48]  yep, I'm going to want
[3217.48 --> 3218.38]  a performance bonus
[3218.38 --> 3219.14]  based on...
[3219.14 --> 3219.96]  What was it in Fallout 3?
[3220.04 --> 3220.88]  Liam Neeson, I think?
[3221.72 --> 3223.64]  Like, there's pretty big names
[3223.64 --> 3225.22]  that do these voice acting things,
[3225.26 --> 3226.36]  and I'm sure they could
[3226.36 --> 3227.48]  pull for leverage on that
[3227.48 --> 3228.34]  if they really wanted to.
[3228.42 --> 3229.30]  I don't know if I agree
[3229.30 --> 3229.82]  with it being in
[3229.82 --> 3231.04]  every single contract.
[3231.36 --> 3232.40]  Having more transparency,
[3232.98 --> 3233.86]  super cool.
[3234.66 --> 3236.36]  Possibly getting compensated better.
[3237.16 --> 3237.76]  You know what?
[3238.52 --> 3239.82]  I want really good voice actors.
[3239.94 --> 3240.52]  If that helps
[3240.52 --> 3241.50]  really good voice actors
[3241.50 --> 3242.10]  be a thing,
[3242.76 --> 3243.12]  cool.
[3244.00 --> 3244.20]  Yeah.
[3244.64 --> 3245.16]  I had...
[3245.16 --> 3246.02]  Actually, speaking of
[3246.02 --> 3247.02]  really good voice actors,
[3247.22 --> 3247.68]  it's funny.
[3247.92 --> 3248.98]  I saw some comments
[3248.98 --> 3250.24]  on the...
[3250.24 --> 3250.98]  This was posted by
[3250.98 --> 3251.94]  Boozoo on the forum,
[3252.00 --> 3252.34]  by the way,
[3252.38 --> 3253.46]  and in the original thread,
[3253.68 --> 3254.54]  I saw some comments
[3254.54 --> 3255.42]  from people saying like,
[3255.86 --> 3256.78]  oh, why are they
[3256.78 --> 3257.58]  being such bitches?
[3257.70 --> 3258.66]  All they do is like,
[3259.00 --> 3260.16]  sit in front of their microphone
[3260.16 --> 3260.82]  and like,
[3261.24 --> 3261.96]  voice act.
[3262.04 --> 3262.66]  It's easy.
[3262.84 --> 3263.34]  It's not as easy
[3263.34 --> 3263.78]  as you think.
[3263.78 --> 3263.96]  Yeah.
[3266.14 --> 3267.72]  Literally, you do it.
[3267.78 --> 3268.70]  There was Skywind.
[3269.08 --> 3270.28]  Skywind is like a whole bunch
[3270.28 --> 3270.94]  of people are trying to develop
[3270.94 --> 3271.62]  for Skywind.
[3271.96 --> 3273.02]  And I decided that I would
[3273.02 --> 3274.16]  try to do voice acting
[3274.16 --> 3275.04]  because they were looking
[3275.04 --> 3275.76]  for voice actors
[3275.76 --> 3276.32]  to do a whole bunch
[3276.32 --> 3276.88]  of different parts.
[3277.08 --> 3278.30]  And I knew I had like
[3278.30 --> 3279.22]  an okay mic.
[3279.36 --> 3280.06]  It was the snowball.
[3280.28 --> 3281.04]  It wasn't great.
[3281.18 --> 3281.28]  Yeah.
[3281.28 --> 3282.10]  But like they said
[3282.10 --> 3282.56]  on the thing
[3282.56 --> 3283.02]  that it was one
[3283.02 --> 3283.76]  of the approved mics
[3283.76 --> 3284.44]  and I was going to try
[3284.44 --> 3285.44]  to get like a ghetto
[3285.44 --> 3286.28]  pop filter for it
[3286.28 --> 3286.62]  and stuff.
[3286.98 --> 3287.72]  And I went through the list
[3287.72 --> 3288.60]  trying to pick like,
[3288.60 --> 3289.82]  what could my voice
[3289.82 --> 3290.60]  work for in here?
[3290.72 --> 3291.10]  And I'm like,
[3291.18 --> 3291.56]  wow.
[3293.12 --> 3293.56]  Nothing.
[3294.38 --> 3295.40]  Oh, wow.
[3295.60 --> 3296.32]  And then like found
[3296.32 --> 3296.82]  something that it would
[3296.82 --> 3297.28]  work for.
[3297.58 --> 3299.04]  Did like 80 takes
[3299.04 --> 3299.80]  of the one line
[3299.80 --> 3300.54]  that I had to do.
[3301.10 --> 3301.90]  Remembering and listening
[3301.90 --> 3302.62]  to that line
[3302.62 --> 3303.28]  being delivered
[3303.28 --> 3304.50]  from the original Morwind
[3304.50 --> 3305.06]  and then eventually
[3305.06 --> 3305.50]  being like,
[3305.68 --> 3306.00]  nope.
[3306.24 --> 3307.02]  There's better people.
[3307.24 --> 3307.76]  They'll do it.
[3307.94 --> 3308.42]  I suck.
[3308.66 --> 3309.26]  And moving on.
[3309.72 --> 3309.82]  Yeah.
[3309.88 --> 3310.08]  I mean,
[3310.10 --> 3311.28]  especially when you
[3311.28 --> 3312.54]  don't even have any
[3312.54 --> 3313.58]  actions to go along
[3313.58 --> 3313.88]  with it.
[3313.98 --> 3314.34]  Yes.
[3314.46 --> 3314.88]  You can't even
[3314.88 --> 3315.98]  necessarily look at the
[3315.98 --> 3317.18]  character doing what
[3317.18 --> 3317.86]  they're supposed to be doing.
[3317.86 --> 3318.90]  Like trying to emote
[3318.90 --> 3320.04]  in a way that is
[3320.04 --> 3321.82]  going to not look
[3321.82 --> 3323.36]  and sound completely
[3323.36 --> 3324.30]  weird and unnatural
[3324.30 --> 3324.90]  when the player
[3324.90 --> 3325.72]  is experiencing it
[3325.72 --> 3327.84]  is not an easy task.
[3327.84 --> 3328.70]  And you could kind of go,
[3329.06 --> 3329.68]  oh, well, you know,
[3329.74 --> 3331.28]  once they practice it up
[3331.28 --> 3332.14]  and get good at it,
[3332.16 --> 3333.08]  then it's easy for them.
[3333.52 --> 3334.22]  Well, you know what?
[3334.28 --> 3335.36]  That's the investment
[3335.36 --> 3336.12]  they made
[3336.12 --> 3337.86]  into developing a skill.
[3338.20 --> 3339.06]  I mean, quite frankly,
[3339.56 --> 3340.24]  here, here,
[3340.30 --> 3340.58]  I'm going to,
[3340.62 --> 3341.68]  I'm going to blow your mind.
[3342.42 --> 3343.74]  Pretty much everything
[3343.74 --> 3345.06]  is easy.
[3345.44 --> 3345.68]  Yeah.
[3345.68 --> 3346.82]  If you break it down enough
[3346.82 --> 3349.40]  is plumbing rocket science.
[3349.90 --> 3350.36]  No.
[3351.54 --> 3352.46]  So why is it that
[3352.46 --> 3353.36]  I have to pay someone
[3353.36 --> 3354.76]  $75 an hour
[3354.76 --> 3355.58]  to come to my house
[3355.58 --> 3356.12]  and do it?
[3356.48 --> 3357.90]  Because I don't know how.
[3358.30 --> 3359.46]  And because that person
[3359.46 --> 3360.86]  invested that time
[3360.86 --> 3361.82]  into learning how.
[3362.08 --> 3363.34]  And if I were to go
[3363.34 --> 3364.58]  and educate myself
[3364.58 --> 3365.60]  on how to do it
[3365.60 --> 3367.26]  for the four times
[3367.26 --> 3368.44]  in my entire life
[3368.44 --> 3369.66]  that it'll ever come up
[3369.66 --> 3370.66]  and go acquire
[3370.66 --> 3371.32]  all the tools,
[3371.52 --> 3372.40]  another investment,
[3372.66 --> 3373.40]  that I would need
[3373.40 --> 3374.54]  in order to do it
[3374.54 --> 3375.78]  with any standard of quality,
[3375.78 --> 3377.24]  I would spend more
[3377.24 --> 3377.84]  than it costs
[3377.84 --> 3378.72]  to just pay someone
[3378.72 --> 3379.26]  to do it.
[3379.66 --> 3380.54]  That is how
[3380.54 --> 3381.64]  these things work.
[3381.64 --> 3382.38]  Some people think
[3382.38 --> 3383.40]  math is very easy
[3383.40 --> 3384.68]  and they're probably
[3384.68 --> 3385.94]  justified to a certain degree.
[3386.20 --> 3386.82]  And some people think
[3386.82 --> 3387.70]  art is very easy
[3387.70 --> 3388.90]  and they're probably
[3388.90 --> 3390.00]  justified to a certain degree.
[3390.42 --> 3391.12]  And some,
[3391.24 --> 3392.02]  but not all,
[3392.12 --> 3392.74]  of those people
[3392.74 --> 3394.00]  don't cross over.
[3395.16 --> 3396.14]  Some things are easy
[3396.14 --> 3396.66]  for some people
[3396.66 --> 3397.20]  and they're hard for others.
[3397.20 --> 3397.62]  Oh, okay.
[3397.68 --> 3398.60]  Well, I was talking more
[3398.60 --> 3399.44]  in terms of like
[3399.44 --> 3401.34]  practical, practical things.
[3401.48 --> 3402.22]  I wasn't necessarily
[3402.22 --> 3402.76]  talking about,
[3403.26 --> 3403.60]  I wasn't,
[3403.94 --> 3406.76]  okay, by practical,
[3406.96 --> 3407.44]  I mean things
[3407.44 --> 3408.48]  that you like do.
[3408.66 --> 3409.24]  You don't do math?
[3410.02 --> 3410.32]  You don't,
[3410.52 --> 3410.96]  you're not being
[3410.96 --> 3411.32]  very helpful.
[3411.40 --> 3412.20]  I wasn't talking about,
[3412.20 --> 3413.38]  I wasn't talking about
[3413.38 --> 3415.68]  like high level thinking
[3415.68 --> 3416.74]  conceptual stuff
[3416.74 --> 3417.18]  or,
[3417.18 --> 3418.98]  or subjective art.
[3419.16 --> 3420.02]  I was talking about
[3420.02 --> 3420.62]  things like,
[3420.62 --> 3421.22]  like plumbing
[3421.22 --> 3422.34]  or things like
[3422.34 --> 3423.30]  drywalling.
[3423.42 --> 3424.98]  Is drywalling hard?
[3425.44 --> 3425.96]  Not if you know
[3425.96 --> 3426.64]  how to do it,
[3426.64 --> 3428.04]  but you have to
[3428.04 --> 3429.08]  actually learn how to,
[3429.08 --> 3430.48]  oh, shut up.
[3431.16 --> 3432.40]  Shut up with your math.
[3432.70 --> 3433.00]  He just,
[3433.08 --> 3433.44]  he just,
[3433.58 --> 3434.68]  he likes ragging on me
[3434.68 --> 3435.94]  because I can't do math.
[3436.90 --> 3437.84]  Both of the things
[3437.84 --> 3438.22]  you said
[3438.22 --> 3439.48]  both have math involved.
[3439.62 --> 3440.66]  Plumbing and drywalling
[3440.66 --> 3441.72]  both have math involved.
[3443.32 --> 3443.94]  All right.
[3444.34 --> 3445.38]  So Ars Technica
[3445.38 --> 3445.42]  has their,
[3445.42 --> 3446.64]  You can do it without math.
[3446.76 --> 3447.28]  Ars Technica
[3447.28 --> 3448.04]  has their Android
[3448.04 --> 3448.88]  marshmallow review.
[3449.04 --> 3449.42]  This was posted
[3449.42 --> 3450.90]  by Zmule on the forum.
[3453.32 --> 3454.44]  Basically brings in
[3454.44 --> 3455.48]  a lot of user
[3455.48 --> 3456.38]  requested features,
[3456.68 --> 3458.38]  but still has no
[3458.38 --> 3459.38]  update solution.
[3459.52 --> 3460.50]  I'm glad that Ars
[3460.50 --> 3461.24]  brought this up
[3461.24 --> 3463.56]  because it really is
[3463.56 --> 3464.88]  the Achilles heel
[3464.88 --> 3466.84]  of Android right now.
[3466.92 --> 3467.94]  The fact that there is
[3467.94 --> 3470.26]  just no strategy
[3470.26 --> 3471.10]  in place
[3471.10 --> 3472.54]  to address the way
[3472.54 --> 3473.72]  that Apple updates
[3473.72 --> 3474.62]  their older devices
[3474.62 --> 3475.90]  and that Microsoft
[3475.90 --> 3476.90]  is coming out saying,
[3477.02 --> 3477.66]  yep, Windows 10
[3477.66 --> 3479.30]  is like the last Windows,
[3479.44 --> 3480.00]  and I'm sure there's
[3480.00 --> 3480.88]  an asterisk in there
[3480.88 --> 3481.18]  somewhere,
[3481.34 --> 3482.40]  but the last Windows.
[3482.40 --> 3482.42]  The last Windows
[3482.42 --> 3483.02]  until we release
[3483.02 --> 3483.56]  another Windows.
[3483.68 --> 3483.80]  Yeah.
[3484.38 --> 3484.90]  But,
[3484.96 --> 3485.18]  but,
[3485.26 --> 3486.42]  but basically it's a statement
[3486.42 --> 3487.90]  about support as well
[3487.90 --> 3488.50]  where they're saying
[3488.50 --> 3489.56]  on notebooks,
[3489.72 --> 3490.36]  on desktops,
[3490.44 --> 3491.14]  on phones,
[3491.62 --> 3492.66]  we want this to be
[3492.66 --> 3493.18]  the Windows
[3493.18 --> 3493.96]  that just kind of
[3493.96 --> 3494.16]  you,
[3494.20 --> 3494.42]  you,
[3494.48 --> 3495.64]  you do rolling updates
[3495.64 --> 3496.38]  to the way
[3496.38 --> 3497.06]  that you would
[3497.06 --> 3498.40]  with a mobile OS.
[3499.10 --> 3500.32]  So there's some good stuff.
[3500.42 --> 3501.18]  There's a new home screen
[3501.18 --> 3501.98]  with some genuinely
[3501.98 --> 3502.76]  useful features
[3502.76 --> 3503.58]  like app search,
[3503.82 --> 3504.54]  predictive apps,
[3504.60 --> 3505.30]  and vertical scrolling.
[3505.40 --> 3506.04]  I feel like we talked
[3506.04 --> 3506.76]  about this last week.
[3506.76 --> 3507.84]  We did, yes.
[3508.06 --> 3508.86]  Yeah, we covered this
[3508.86 --> 3509.28]  last week.
[3509.34 --> 3510.10]  Why the hell is this
[3510.10 --> 3510.82]  in the Wanshow dog?
[3510.84 --> 3511.64]  I don't know.
[3514.46 --> 3515.34]  Womp womp.
[3516.40 --> 3516.54]  I,
[3516.64 --> 3517.58]  I think,
[3517.94 --> 3518.90]  it's not the first time
[3518.90 --> 3519.42]  this has happened,
[3519.50 --> 3520.40]  but it hasn't happened
[3520.40 --> 3520.94]  in a while.
[3521.04 --> 3521.60]  It's been a bit.
[3522.08 --> 3523.34]  There are some more
[3523.34 --> 3524.30]  companies added
[3524.30 --> 3526.38]  to the diesel emissions
[3526.38 --> 3527.74]  scandal.
[3528.54 --> 3529.18]  Mercedes-Benz,
[3529.34 --> 3529.66]  Honda,
[3529.86 --> 3530.26]  Mazda,
[3530.36 --> 3531.36]  and Mitsubishi.
[3532.60 --> 3532.82]  Ooh,
[3532.82 --> 3534.86]  that's not a small amount
[3534.86 --> 3535.98]  at all.
[3535.98 --> 3536.42]  Yep.
[3536.88 --> 3537.26]  So,
[3537.78 --> 3539.36]  things are getting
[3539.36 --> 3540.20]  real here,
[3540.32 --> 3540.74]  kids.
[3542.46 --> 3542.90]  Ah.
[3547.08 --> 3547.64]  So,
[3547.82 --> 3549.14]  in some realistic
[3549.14 --> 3550.12]  on-road tests,
[3550.26 --> 3551.08]  some Honda models
[3551.08 --> 3552.16]  admitted six times
[3552.16 --> 3553.32]  the regulatory limit,
[3553.72 --> 3554.80]  while some unnamed
[3554.80 --> 3555.68]  4x4 models
[3555.68 --> 3556.98]  had 20 times
[3556.98 --> 3557.42]  the limit
[3557.42 --> 3557.86]  coming out
[3557.86 --> 3558.88]  of their exhaust pipes.
[3559.00 --> 3559.58]  Last week,
[3559.94 --> 3560.86]  whoa,
[3560.98 --> 3561.52]  I'm going to fail
[3561.52 --> 3562.10]  at saying a bunch
[3562.10 --> 3562.42]  of these.
[3564.12 --> 3564.74]  Is it Renault?
[3565.18 --> 3565.64]  Renault,
[3565.72 --> 3565.96]  Nissan,
[3566.30 --> 3566.64]  Hyundai,
[3567.16 --> 3567.54]  Citroen,
[3567.68 --> 3567.94]  Fiat,
[3568.10 --> 3568.40]  Volvo,
[3568.56 --> 3568.90]  and Jeep
[3568.90 --> 3569.36]  were all that
[3569.36 --> 3570.12]  added to the list
[3570.12 --> 3570.60]  last week?
[3570.78 --> 3571.84]  I think it's Renault?
[3572.10 --> 3572.48]  Renault?
[3572.54 --> 3572.98]  Renault?
[3573.16 --> 3573.52]  Renault?
[3574.08 --> 3574.80]  It's French,
[3574.96 --> 3575.60]  so Renault.
[3575.92 --> 3576.26]  Renault.
[3576.94 --> 3577.22]  Whatever,
[3577.36 --> 3577.70]  someone's going
[3577.70 --> 3578.28]  to correct us.
[3578.42 --> 3578.54]  Oh,
[3578.56 --> 3579.08]  we're going to get
[3579.08 --> 3579.72]  slammed.
[3579.88 --> 3580.34]  I haven't watched
[3580.34 --> 3581.10]  enough Top Gear.
[3582.00 --> 3582.34]  Yeah.
[3582.52 --> 3582.92]  Oh,
[3582.96 --> 3583.68]  we're getting slammed.
[3583.76 --> 3583.90]  Yeah,
[3583.94 --> 3584.20]  whatever.
[3584.36 --> 3584.60]  Oh,
[3584.60 --> 3585.08]  there it goes.
[3585.46 --> 3585.86]  So,
[3585.98 --> 3586.98]  this is hilarious.
[3588.06 --> 3589.50]  VW's North American,
[3589.68 --> 3590.10]  I want to say
[3590.10 --> 3590.84]  president or something
[3590.84 --> 3591.34]  like anyway,
[3591.70 --> 3593.94]  basically came out
[3593.94 --> 3594.50]  and said,
[3594.72 --> 3594.92]  like,
[3594.92 --> 3595.84]  it was a couple
[3595.84 --> 3596.86]  of rogue engineers
[3596.86 --> 3599.26]  who did this
[3599.26 --> 3600.52]  behind everyone's back.
[3600.60 --> 3601.36]  I'm paraphrasing.
[3601.48 --> 3602.08]  Bullshit.
[3602.08 --> 3604.10]  And so,
[3604.46 --> 3605.14]  so yeah,
[3605.28 --> 3605.66]  and then,
[3605.80 --> 3606.68]  and then basically
[3606.68 --> 3607.78]  just pulled the diesel
[3607.78 --> 3608.96]  lineup from North America,
[3608.96 --> 3609.96]  which is about
[3609.96 --> 3611.40]  one in five of the cars
[3611.40 --> 3612.12]  that they're selling
[3612.12 --> 3613.18]  across VW
[3613.18 --> 3614.16]  and Audi
[3614.16 --> 3615.04]  in North America.
[3615.32 --> 3616.12]  So it is,
[3616.18 --> 3616.98]  it is going to be
[3616.98 --> 3618.46]  dark times for VW
[3618.46 --> 3619.10]  over the next
[3619.10 --> 3619.86]  little bit here.
[3620.30 --> 3620.90]  And,
[3621.04 --> 3621.42]  um,
[3621.42 --> 3622.50]  this is interesting.
[3622.84 --> 3623.94]  Some consumers
[3623.94 --> 3625.46]  are refusing
[3625.46 --> 3626.34]  the recall.
[3626.34 --> 3629.20]  And in California,
[3629.20 --> 3630.20]  I believe there's
[3630.20 --> 3631.66]  legislation that can,
[3631.70 --> 3632.18]  um,
[3632.50 --> 3633.92]  cause them to not be able
[3633.92 --> 3635.20]  to re-register their vehicle.
[3635.82 --> 3636.24]  I was going to say,
[3636.34 --> 3636.56]  you're not,
[3636.72 --> 3636.90]  they're,
[3636.90 --> 3638.12]  they're illegal to be on the road.
[3638.22 --> 3638.74]  You can't just.
[3639.22 --> 3640.46]  But in some states,
[3640.46 --> 3641.58]  there is actually
[3641.58 --> 3643.16]  no law in place
[3643.16 --> 3644.42]  that would prevent people
[3644.42 --> 3645.66]  from continuing
[3645.66 --> 3646.68]  to drive the vehicle,
[3646.78 --> 3647.26]  even though.
[3647.40 --> 3648.20]  Wouldn't they have to pass
[3648.20 --> 3649.08]  like environmental standards?
[3649.20 --> 3649.46]  Is that,
[3649.58 --> 3650.44]  because we have that up here.
[3650.52 --> 3651.30]  Do they not have that?
[3651.30 --> 3652.00]  Aircare's gone.
[3652.80 --> 3653.20]  Oh.
[3654.02 --> 3654.30]  Yeah.
[3654.88 --> 3655.28]  Yeah,
[3655.32 --> 3655.84]  Aircare's gone.
[3655.92 --> 3656.58]  It was dissolved,
[3656.72 --> 3656.86]  I think,
[3656.90 --> 3657.26]  last year.
[3657.92 --> 3658.98]  That doesn't seem
[3658.98 --> 3659.70]  like a good idea.
[3659.84 --> 3660.86]  I don't know.
[3661.34 --> 3661.68]  Um,
[3661.68 --> 3662.06]  anyway,
[3662.18 --> 3662.94]  the point is,
[3663.26 --> 3663.92]  some people,
[3664.22 --> 3666.54]  citing performance concerns,
[3667.12 --> 3667.50]  cause it,
[3667.50 --> 3668.82]  it will nerf the car a bit,
[3668.98 --> 3670.20]  are saying they don't want
[3670.20 --> 3671.32]  their car recalled.
[3671.42 --> 3672.32]  They don't want it fixed.
[3672.60 --> 3673.54]  I don't want your car
[3673.54 --> 3674.92]  dumping crap into the air.
[3675.00 --> 3675.22]  Yeah,
[3675.30 --> 3675.56]  I mean,
[3675.62 --> 3676.24]  it has been,
[3676.32 --> 3676.86]  it has been,
[3677.12 --> 3677.34]  like,
[3677.42 --> 3677.74]  there's some,
[3677.80 --> 3678.54]  there's some more numbers
[3678.54 --> 3678.96]  out now.
[3679.04 --> 3679.76]  I think it's something
[3679.76 --> 3681.18]  like 400,000.
[3681.18 --> 3683.04]  California has emission standards,
[3683.34 --> 3685.42]  but it depends on the state.
[3685.70 --> 3686.46]  In some states,
[3686.56 --> 3687.66]  they just don't care.
[3687.68 --> 3688.20]  I said that.
[3688.62 --> 3689.36]  I'm clarifying.
[3689.36 --> 3689.60]  Oh,
[3689.72 --> 3689.96]  okay.
[3690.12 --> 3690.90]  Cause you said you think,
[3691.00 --> 3691.26]  didn't you?
[3691.50 --> 3691.68]  Oh,
[3691.74 --> 3691.94]  maybe.
[3692.32 --> 3692.54]  Okay,
[3692.62 --> 3692.92]  so yes,
[3693.00 --> 3694.14]  California for sure.
[3694.82 --> 3695.22]  Um,
[3695.32 --> 3695.62]  anyway,
[3695.78 --> 3696.82]  so it's something along the lines
[3696.82 --> 3699.22]  of 350 or 400,000 cars.
[3699.60 --> 3699.98]  Um,
[3700.06 --> 3700.14]  I,
[3700.30 --> 3700.58]  I,
[3700.66 --> 3701.22]  this was an article
[3701.22 --> 3702.58]  I was just reading earlier today.
[3702.72 --> 3703.06]  It's not,
[3703.12 --> 3703.92]  I don't have notes on it,
[3703.98 --> 3704.18]  but,
[3704.54 --> 3704.82]  um,
[3704.82 --> 3705.32]  that are using,
[3705.32 --> 3705.52]  like,
[3705.54 --> 3706.60]  a first gen engine
[3706.60 --> 3707.80]  or something like that,
[3707.82 --> 3710.34]  that requires not just a software update,
[3710.34 --> 3712.86]  but also physical changes.
[3714.74 --> 3715.22]  Hilarious.
[3715.48 --> 3717.24]  And then I think it's only the third gen
[3717.24 --> 3718.68]  and maybe second gen ones
[3718.68 --> 3719.88]  that can maybe be fixed
[3719.88 --> 3720.98]  with a software update.
[3721.54 --> 3722.48]  So this is,
[3722.58 --> 3723.20]  this is,
[3723.66 --> 3724.06]  I mean,
[3724.42 --> 3724.74]  the,
[3724.80 --> 3725.00]  the,
[3725.08 --> 3726.26]  the bottomless,
[3726.40 --> 3727.72]  the bottomless pit
[3727.72 --> 3729.86]  of how much this is going to cost VW
[3729.86 --> 3731.46]  just continues to,
[3731.46 --> 3733.40]  to gape open.
[3733.40 --> 3734.30]  Um,
[3734.44 --> 3734.74]  yeah,
[3734.80 --> 3735.82]  this is looking pretty ugly.
[3736.04 --> 3736.36]  Hmm.
[3737.58 --> 3737.96]  Actually,
[3737.96 --> 3738.90]  some of these topics
[3738.90 --> 3739.70]  are kind of boring.
[3740.28 --> 3742.68]  So I think I'm just going to kind of
[3742.68 --> 3744.10]  skim over a lot of them.
[3744.46 --> 3744.86]  Womp,
[3745.02 --> 3745.50]  womp.
[3745.98 --> 3746.86]  What ones are you skimming
[3746.86 --> 3747.66]  so I know where to show them?
[3747.66 --> 3747.90]  I don't know,
[3747.96 --> 3748.24]  kind of,
[3748.26 --> 3749.24]  kind of a lot of them.
[3749.32 --> 3749.48]  Oh,
[3749.54 --> 3749.74]  right.
[3750.10 --> 3750.56]  Um,
[3750.56 --> 3750.82]  oh,
[3750.86 --> 3751.48]  this is cool.
[3752.04 --> 3752.52]  So,
[3753.20 --> 3754.46]  Anantek article here,
[3754.60 --> 3757.28]  the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus,
[3758.42 --> 3758.58]  they,
[3759.10 --> 3761.56]  Anantek showed some preliminary results
[3761.56 --> 3764.06]  that revealed that they are using
[3764.06 --> 3765.82]  an NVMe SSD,
[3766.52 --> 3769.46]  which is a huge,
[3769.68 --> 3770.88]  huge deal.
[3770.96 --> 3772.36]  They also appear to be using
[3772.36 --> 3773.58]  a smart SLC,
[3773.76 --> 3776.84]  kind of hybrid SLC TLC NAND solution
[3776.84 --> 3779.24]  that gives it really fast burst performance
[3779.24 --> 3781.52]  with slower sustained performance,
[3781.64 --> 3783.38]  something that's not terribly important
[3783.38 --> 3785.64]  because you would almost never be writing,
[3785.70 --> 3785.96]  like,
[3786.42 --> 3788.38]  huge files continuously
[3788.38 --> 3790.24]  that would exceed
[3790.24 --> 3792.12]  what the TLC flash is capable of.
[3792.18 --> 3792.28]  Like,
[3792.28 --> 3793.88]  even recording video continuously
[3793.88 --> 3795.94]  is going to be fine.
[3796.34 --> 3798.06]  It's been measured at up to,
[3798.20 --> 3798.62]  I think,
[3798.76 --> 3799.04]  uh,
[3799.04 --> 3800.40]  I've got in my notes
[3800.40 --> 3801.86]  up to,
[3801.86 --> 3802.70]  uh,
[3804.84 --> 3806.26]  sequential read speeds
[3806.26 --> 3807.78]  in the neighborhood of,
[3807.98 --> 3808.22]  oh,
[3808.54 --> 3808.82]  balls.
[3808.82 --> 3809.02]  No,
[3809.08 --> 3809.88]  I don't think that,
[3809.90 --> 3810.94]  I don't think that number's right.
[3811.06 --> 3811.14]  So,
[3811.22 --> 3811.60]  I'm just going to,
[3811.60 --> 3812.84]  I'm just going to ignore it.
[3813.34 --> 3813.70]  Um,
[3813.82 --> 3815.24]  sequential reads of,
[3815.84 --> 3816.06]  okay,
[3816.12 --> 3816.36]  oh yeah,
[3816.46 --> 3818.10]  256 kilobytes sequential reads
[3818.10 --> 3818.92]  in megabytes per second
[3818.92 --> 3821.16]  of 400 megs per second
[3821.16 --> 3822.42]  with sequential writes
[3822.42 --> 3824.50]  of 160 megabytes per second.
[3824.60 --> 3824.70]  So,
[3824.76 --> 3825.40]  we're talking,
[3825.96 --> 3827.12]  getting pretty close
[3827.12 --> 3828.46]  to an entry level
[3828.46 --> 3830.74]  SSD controller in here.
[3831.18 --> 3832.12]  Not to mention that
[3832.12 --> 3833.26]  because it's NVMe,
[3833.60 --> 3834.60]  random performance
[3834.60 --> 3836.16]  is significantly improved.
[3836.16 --> 3836.48]  Yeah.
[3836.62 --> 3837.76]  I had been trying
[3837.76 --> 3838.98]  to put my finger on
[3838.98 --> 3839.60]  because I,
[3839.72 --> 3840.66]  I have not done
[3840.66 --> 3841.42]  any actual,
[3841.56 --> 3841.98]  You just can't put
[3841.98 --> 3842.60]  your finger on?
[3842.84 --> 3843.30]  Thank you.
[3843.66 --> 3844.72]  Objective benchmarks
[3844.72 --> 3846.24]  on the iPhone 6S.
[3846.38 --> 3847.26]  But I've been trying
[3847.26 --> 3848.12]  to put my finger on
[3848.12 --> 3848.48]  Oh no.
[3848.48 --> 3850.12]  Why the crap?
[3850.66 --> 3851.52]  App launching
[3851.52 --> 3852.28]  and switching
[3852.28 --> 3854.14]  was so fast.
[3854.66 --> 3855.88]  And features like
[3855.88 --> 3856.20]  the,
[3856.20 --> 3856.40]  uh,
[3856.40 --> 3857.34]  the 3D touch
[3857.34 --> 3858.70]  to preview web pages.
[3859.42 --> 3860.74]  Why web pages
[3860.74 --> 3862.28]  even seem to load faster?
[3862.38 --> 3862.50]  Like,
[3862.58 --> 3863.78]  everything about this phone
[3863.78 --> 3865.46]  is just so fast.
[3865.52 --> 3865.98]  And I was like,
[3866.52 --> 3866.88]  yeah,
[3867.08 --> 3868.32]  the CPU is better,
[3868.44 --> 3869.50]  but that really
[3869.50 --> 3870.70]  doesn't account for
[3870.70 --> 3872.34]  enough of the difference
[3872.34 --> 3873.00]  in performance.
[3873.38 --> 3874.44]  It's because
[3874.44 --> 3875.28]  the NAND
[3875.28 --> 3877.24]  absolutely blows away
[3877.24 --> 3878.00]  anything that we've
[3878.00 --> 3878.70]  ever seen before.
[3878.82 --> 3878.96]  Like,
[3879.04 --> 3879.80]  here's the graph
[3879.80 --> 3880.54]  on a non-tech
[3880.54 --> 3882.12]  comparing this to,
[3882.26 --> 3883.42]  so here's the 6 Plus,
[3883.54 --> 3884.40]  6S Plus
[3884.40 --> 3885.88]  up at the top here.
[3886.24 --> 3886.68]  So,
[3886.96 --> 3887.70]  the iPhone 6
[3887.70 --> 3888.58]  and 6 Plus
[3888.58 --> 3889.48]  were already
[3889.48 --> 3890.72]  pretty fast,
[3890.74 --> 3891.38]  but compared to
[3891.38 --> 3892.42]  the Galaxy S6,
[3892.46 --> 3893.10]  it's like almost
[3893.10 --> 3894.08]  twice as fast.
[3894.78 --> 3895.64]  That's killer.
[3896.68 --> 3897.04]  So,
[3897.16 --> 3897.44]  um,
[3897.56 --> 3898.02]  so yeah,
[3898.12 --> 3898.70]  the iPhone,
[3899.00 --> 3899.46]  yes,
[3899.52 --> 3900.78]  it's an expensive phone.
[3901.38 --> 3901.64]  Yes,
[3901.70 --> 3902.60]  Apple charges a lot
[3902.60 --> 3903.14]  for phones,
[3903.20 --> 3904.92]  but this is a conversation
[3904.92 --> 3905.74]  that I've been meaning
[3905.74 --> 3906.78]  to have on Wancho
[3906.78 --> 3907.54]  for a little bit.
[3908.32 --> 3908.68]  Oops.
[3909.64 --> 3909.96]  Oh,
[3910.06 --> 3910.26]  look,
[3910.30 --> 3910.68]  it worked.
[3911.68 --> 3912.78]  Everyone looks
[3912.78 --> 3913.78]  at something expensive
[3913.78 --> 3916.02]  and wants to use
[3916.02 --> 3916.46]  the word
[3916.46 --> 3917.80]  overpriced immediately.
[3918.56 --> 3920.00]  What is overpriced?
[3921.08 --> 3921.64]  Overpriced
[3921.64 --> 3922.58]  means you're not
[3922.58 --> 3923.14]  getting
[3923.14 --> 3924.92]  something for
[3924.92 --> 3925.38]  your money
[3925.38 --> 3925.98]  compared to
[3925.98 --> 3926.74]  what you could get
[3926.74 --> 3927.34]  for that money
[3927.34 --> 3928.20]  somewhere else.
[3929.12 --> 3929.94]  If someone's like,
[3930.26 --> 3930.58]  no,
[3930.78 --> 3932.00]  this costs more
[3932.00 --> 3932.66]  because,
[3932.82 --> 3932.98]  okay,
[3933.04 --> 3933.84]  look at the Razorblade.
[3933.84 --> 3934.50]  You could say
[3934.50 --> 3935.46]  the Razorblade 14
[3935.46 --> 3936.96]  is overpriced.
[3937.92 --> 3938.36]  Okay?
[3938.68 --> 3939.62]  Compared to what?
[3940.58 --> 3941.64]  Compare it to something.
[3942.22 --> 3943.24]  If you want something
[3943.24 --> 3943.90]  that has
[3943.90 --> 3944.72]  all the stuff
[3944.72 --> 3945.38]  that it has,
[3945.44 --> 3946.06]  slim design,
[3946.44 --> 3947.44]  high-powered GPU,
[3948.12 --> 3948.40]  uh,
[3948.58 --> 3948.88]  touchscreen.
[3948.88 --> 3949.00]  I don't think that's
[3949.00 --> 3949.88]  the only definition
[3949.88 --> 3950.74]  of overpriced.
[3951.28 --> 3951.50]  Well,
[3951.56 --> 3952.34]  what does overpriced
[3952.34 --> 3952.72]  mean then?
[3953.00 --> 3954.14]  If you have a chocolate bar
[3954.14 --> 3955.06]  and there's no other
[3955.06 --> 3955.52]  chocolate bars
[3955.52 --> 3956.16]  that are exactly
[3956.16 --> 3957.10]  like that chocolate bar
[3957.10 --> 3957.86]  and you charge
[3957.86 --> 3959.08]  $50 for that chocolate bar,
[3959.56 --> 3960.04]  it's probably
[3960.04 --> 3960.80]  still overpriced.
[3960.80 --> 3963.06]  Yes,
[3963.18 --> 3964.20]  because other
[3964.20 --> 3965.42]  similar chocolate bars
[3965.42 --> 3966.76]  that could have
[3966.76 --> 3967.84]  similar features
[3967.84 --> 3969.10]  and similar performance
[3969.10 --> 3970.22]  in your mouth.
[3970.44 --> 3971.80]  But what if they don't?
[3971.80 --> 3972.50]  What if they don't?
[3972.56 --> 3973.44]  What if it actually
[3973.44 --> 3974.70]  tastes 50 times better
[3974.70 --> 3975.64]  than another chocolate bar?
[3975.76 --> 3976.56]  Then it's not overpriced.
[3976.56 --> 3976.68]  But it would have to
[3976.68 --> 3977.30]  actually taste
[3977.30 --> 3978.12]  50 times better.
[3978.36 --> 3978.60]  Right.
[3978.70 --> 3979.28]  Because if I just like
[3979.28 --> 3980.38]  put chunks of licorice
[3980.38 --> 3981.30]  in my chocolate bar,
[3981.50 --> 3982.28]  no other chocolate bar
[3982.28 --> 3982.78]  has that.
[3982.94 --> 3983.90]  That's a unique feature.
[3984.12 --> 3984.96]  You cannot get that
[3984.96 --> 3985.54]  anywhere else.
[3985.68 --> 3986.42]  You'd have to tear
[3986.42 --> 3987.24]  the chocolate bar apart
[3987.24 --> 3988.20]  and put it back together.
[3988.42 --> 3989.28]  That's not the same.
[3989.28 --> 3990.44]  That's not an out-of-package
[3990.44 --> 3991.00]  experience.
[3991.32 --> 3991.64]  Therefore,
[3992.26 --> 3993.16]  you could price it
[3993.16 --> 3993.96]  as whatever you want.
[3994.02 --> 3994.50]  But if you price it
[3994.50 --> 3994.74]  at $50,
[3995.04 --> 3996.04]  it's obviously overpriced.
[3996.10 --> 3996.84]  Okay, so bringing it back
[3996.84 --> 3997.02]  to...
[3997.02 --> 3997.82]  You can't just do
[3997.82 --> 3998.42]  comparative data
[3998.42 --> 3999.00]  for overpriced.
[3999.02 --> 3999.78]  So bringing it back
[3999.78 --> 4000.72]  to your phone...
[4000.72 --> 4001.22]  It has to be value.
[4002.16 --> 4003.08]  But okay,
[4003.20 --> 4004.70]  but with the...
[4004.70 --> 4005.26]  Okay, fine.
[4005.32 --> 4006.10]  But let's talk value
[4006.10 --> 4006.62]  because that's why
[4006.62 --> 4007.20]  I'm saying you have
[4007.20 --> 4007.76]  to compare it
[4007.76 --> 4008.22]  to other stuff
[4008.22 --> 4008.80]  that's out there.
[4009.06 --> 4009.58]  So if you take
[4009.58 --> 4010.44]  the iPhone 6S
[4010.44 --> 4010.78]  and you go,
[4010.88 --> 4011.42]  yeah, this costs
[4011.42 --> 4011.84]  a lot more
[4011.84 --> 4013.02]  than a Galaxy S6,
[4013.52 --> 4015.22]  but it has this
[4015.22 --> 4016.00]  technology that the
[4016.00 --> 4016.36]  other thing
[4016.36 --> 4017.50]  completely straight up
[4017.50 --> 4018.96]  doesn't have
[4018.96 --> 4020.08]  because Apple went
[4020.08 --> 4020.62]  and invested
[4020.62 --> 4021.28]  in building
[4021.28 --> 4023.08]  their own NVMe solution.
[4023.60 --> 4024.10]  They built
[4024.10 --> 4024.70]  their own storage.
[4024.74 --> 4026.22]  So is it...
[4026.22 --> 4027.30]  It's not off the shelf.
[4027.60 --> 4027.88]  Okay.
[4028.00 --> 4028.54]  It's kind of like
[4028.54 --> 4029.00]  what they did
[4029.00 --> 4031.48]  in the iMac 27-inch retina
[4031.48 --> 4032.36]  where they're like,
[4032.52 --> 4033.34]  okay, well,
[4033.48 --> 4034.70]  nothing can drive 5K,
[4035.22 --> 4035.78]  so we're just
[4035.78 --> 4036.14]  going to build
[4036.14 --> 4036.66]  our own thing.
[4036.68 --> 4036.78]  But if they charged
[4036.78 --> 4037.64]  $50,000 for the phone,
[4037.70 --> 4038.52]  then it would be overpriced.
[4038.88 --> 4040.04]  Overpriced can be independent.
[4040.18 --> 4041.22]  Value can be seen
[4041.22 --> 4041.66]  independently.
[4042.08 --> 4043.58]  Yes, it should cost more.
[4044.24 --> 4044.92]  They have put more
[4044.92 --> 4045.66]  research into it.
[4045.66 --> 4047.28]  The thing that is inside
[4047.28 --> 4048.58]  is better than the other thing
[4048.58 --> 4049.54]  that is inside the other thing.
[4049.70 --> 4050.50]  It should cost more,
[4050.60 --> 4051.28]  but it should cost
[4051.28 --> 4052.36]  a scalable amount more.
[4052.58 --> 4053.14]  I'm not even saying
[4053.14 --> 4053.80]  you're necessarily wrong
[4053.80 --> 4054.62]  for just the phone,
[4054.94 --> 4055.86]  but saying that overpriced
[4055.86 --> 4056.64]  is based off of
[4056.64 --> 4057.66]  comparing it to something else
[4057.66 --> 4058.10]  that's similar
[4058.10 --> 4059.26]  is not technically right.
[4059.90 --> 4060.80]  Something can be overpriced
[4060.80 --> 4061.20]  on its own.
[4061.26 --> 4062.00]  Well, it can be...
[4062.00 --> 4062.78]  You have to compare
[4062.78 --> 4063.46]  to something
[4063.46 --> 4064.76]  to evaluate price.
[4064.76 --> 4065.24]  What if there isn't
[4065.24 --> 4066.02]  something to compare to?
[4066.16 --> 4067.42]  Because I didn't say
[4067.42 --> 4068.72]  it's not worth it
[4068.72 --> 4069.90]  or it's worth it.
[4071.68 --> 4072.12]  Overpriced.
[4072.12 --> 4073.86]  Yeah, value is...
[4073.86 --> 4076.82]  No, no, overpriced is...
[4076.82 --> 4077.44]  Okay, so here,
[4077.54 --> 4079.24]  let's take another good example
[4079.24 --> 4080.24]  would be...
[4080.24 --> 4082.92]  Okay, like a diamond-studded phone.
[4083.46 --> 4083.80]  Okay.
[4084.24 --> 4084.60]  Okay.
[4085.02 --> 4086.32]  Does it cost $50,000?
[4086.86 --> 4087.26]  Yes.
[4087.58 --> 4088.48]  Is it overpriced?
[4088.86 --> 4090.10]  If it has, you know,
[4090.14 --> 4091.66]  $40,000 or $45,000
[4091.66 --> 4092.90]  worth of diamonds on it,
[4093.16 --> 4093.38]  no.
[4093.90 --> 4094.50]  Okay, actually,
[4094.62 --> 4095.60]  diamonds are a bad example
[4095.60 --> 4096.50]  because they are,
[4096.84 --> 4097.34]  by definition,
[4097.48 --> 4098.00]  overpriced
[4098.00 --> 4099.52]  because they're actually worthless.
[4099.52 --> 4100.46]  Okay, so let's talk
[4100.46 --> 4102.50]  a solid gold phone then.
[4102.66 --> 4102.90]  Okay.
[4103.12 --> 4104.26]  So if this thing...
[4104.26 --> 4104.66]  But then if the value's
[4104.66 --> 4105.26]  in the gold
[4105.26 --> 4106.56]  and there's a reasonable
[4106.56 --> 4107.38]  amount of markup,
[4107.44 --> 4108.42]  then it wouldn't be overpriced.
[4108.46 --> 4108.64]  Right.
[4108.80 --> 4109.84]  So it's not overpriced.
[4109.86 --> 4110.38]  That's what I'm saying.
[4110.44 --> 4111.30]  So if the feature...
[4111.30 --> 4112.22]  We're trying to say
[4112.22 --> 4112.94]  the same thing.
[4113.30 --> 4114.10]  Not necessarily.
[4114.60 --> 4115.40]  I wasn't saying
[4115.40 --> 4116.06]  that the phone
[4116.06 --> 4117.08]  you are talking about
[4117.08 --> 4118.16]  is even overpriced.
[4118.24 --> 4119.12]  That wasn't my argument.
[4119.38 --> 4119.76]  Okay.
[4120.04 --> 4121.16]  Because it might be
[4121.16 --> 4121.92]  worth the value
[4121.92 --> 4122.56]  because there's,
[4122.66 --> 4123.08]  like I said,
[4123.18 --> 4124.12]  technologies that are in it
[4124.12 --> 4124.76]  that are better
[4124.76 --> 4125.50]  than the other ones,
[4125.56 --> 4126.42]  so it should cost more
[4126.42 --> 4127.46]  because they invested in it
[4127.46 --> 4128.06]  and they made it better
[4128.06 --> 4128.52]  and then they should
[4129.52 --> 4130.54]  that's how markets work.
[4130.86 --> 4131.64]  But saying that something
[4131.64 --> 4133.58]  is overpriced solely
[4133.58 --> 4134.88]  because you're comparing it
[4134.88 --> 4135.94]  to one other thing,
[4137.36 --> 4138.20]  that you can look at it
[4138.20 --> 4139.06]  from more angles than that.
[4139.98 --> 4141.00]  You were saying that
[4141.00 --> 4142.48]  you determine if something
[4142.48 --> 4143.04]  is overpriced
[4143.04 --> 4144.40]  by comparing it to...
[4144.40 --> 4144.72]  Something.
[4145.20 --> 4145.56]  Yeah.
[4146.02 --> 4146.86]  You can say something
[4146.86 --> 4147.34]  is overpriced
[4147.34 --> 4147.76]  if there's nothing
[4147.76 --> 4148.36]  to compare it to.
[4149.40 --> 4150.96]  If I offer a stick...
[4150.96 --> 4151.98]  Well, okay, but you would...
[4151.98 --> 4152.76]  That happens to have...
[4152.76 --> 4153.78]  You would still compare
[4153.78 --> 4155.26]  because you would have to compare.
[4155.36 --> 4155.80]  So let's go back
[4155.80 --> 4156.50]  to your chocolate bar.
[4156.84 --> 4157.76]  You would have to compare it
[4157.76 --> 4158.70]  to the cost of licorice
[4158.70 --> 4159.18]  and chocolate.
[4160.24 --> 4161.48]  That's still a comparison.
[4162.10 --> 4163.36]  You have to compare
[4163.36 --> 4164.20]  to something
[4164.20 --> 4166.04]  because otherwise
[4166.04 --> 4167.20]  there's no point of reference.
[4167.34 --> 4167.72]  Like how much
[4167.72 --> 4168.72]  does Jupiter cost?
[4169.14 --> 4169.56]  HoloLens.
[4170.00 --> 4170.44]  HoloLens.
[4170.78 --> 4171.12]  Okay.
[4171.40 --> 4171.98]  It's $3,000.
[4172.36 --> 4173.12]  It's $3,000.
[4173.44 --> 4173.70]  Yeah.
[4174.10 --> 4174.92]  What if HoloLens
[4174.92 --> 4175.80]  was $50,000?
[4176.38 --> 4177.68]  If it was $50,000...
[4177.68 --> 4178.80]  Because $3,000 is like,
[4179.00 --> 4179.38]  ugh,
[4179.50 --> 4180.20]  but they have a whole bunch
[4180.20 --> 4180.72]  of tech in there
[4180.72 --> 4181.38]  that might be interesting.
[4181.50 --> 4182.24]  I don't know how much that cost.
[4182.26 --> 4182.78]  Well then, same thing.
[4182.90 --> 4184.76]  You have to break it back down
[4184.76 --> 4185.08]  to the components inside.
[4185.08 --> 4185.98]  But it's not going to cost
[4185.98 --> 4186.62]  $50,000.
[4186.72 --> 4187.64]  That would be overpriced.
[4187.64 --> 4188.06]  It won't.
[4188.06 --> 4189.30]  What are you going to compare it to?
[4189.58 --> 4190.30]  You would compare it to...
[4190.30 --> 4191.08]  You can't compare it
[4191.08 --> 4192.06]  to the $3,000 version
[4192.06 --> 4192.40]  that doesn't exist in the universe.
[4192.40 --> 4192.88]  No, no, no.
[4192.88 --> 4193.42]  You can't.
[4193.58 --> 4194.16]  You compare it
[4194.16 --> 4195.28]  to what's actually in it.
[4195.90 --> 4197.44]  So is it made of unobtainium?
[4197.70 --> 4198.46]  Then, okay, fine.
[4198.46 --> 4199.02]  That's what I'm saying.
[4199.02 --> 4200.80]  So if it has an NVMe device in it,
[4200.84 --> 4201.66]  it's not in the other one,
[4201.72 --> 4202.18]  it's fine.
[4202.22 --> 4203.20]  But you don't have to compare it
[4203.20 --> 4203.84]  to another phone
[4203.84 --> 4204.74]  that doesn't have it in it.
[4205.38 --> 4206.04]  You have to compare it
[4206.04 --> 4207.04]  to what made up the phone.
[4207.50 --> 4208.44]  Okay, I see.
[4208.56 --> 4209.70]  Yes, you can do that.
[4209.84 --> 4210.58]  It has to be value.
[4210.76 --> 4211.58]  There's going to be markups.
[4211.58 --> 4212.38]  There's going to be distribution.
[4212.64 --> 4214.42]  You can individualize the comparison.
[4214.42 --> 4215.16]  The problem is that
[4215.16 --> 4215.88]  a lot of people
[4215.88 --> 4217.02]  don't consider...
[4217.60 --> 4219.36]  Because if you look at bomb cost,
[4219.42 --> 4220.04]  a lot of people,
[4220.22 --> 4220.58]  when they say,
[4220.66 --> 4222.20]  oh, the iPhone is overpriced,
[4222.64 --> 4223.50]  they don't consider
[4223.50 --> 4225.02]  that there's an enormous team
[4225.02 --> 4226.02]  of people working on it
[4226.02 --> 4226.54]  for a year.
[4226.54 --> 4229.20]  That's because they're ignorant.
[4230.02 --> 4230.76]  Oh, okay.
[4231.70 --> 4233.46]  Because there's R&D teams,
[4233.56 --> 4234.12]  there's distribution,
[4234.36 --> 4235.06]  there's manufacturing,
[4235.38 --> 4237.24]  there's resale.
[4237.24 --> 4237.60]  Yeah, I know.
[4239.44 --> 4240.64]  I don't really remember
[4240.64 --> 4241.62]  my original point,
[4241.70 --> 4242.84]  and I don't know what yours is.
[4243.46 --> 4245.00]  Mine was that you were stating
[4245.00 --> 4249.66]  how you were lining up
[4249.66 --> 4250.82]  your phrase was not right.
[4251.84 --> 4252.52]  You were saying,
[4252.58 --> 4253.32]  everyone's wrong
[4253.32 --> 4254.36]  because everyone compares
[4254.36 --> 4255.86]  overpriced this thing
[4255.86 --> 4256.92]  because saying it's overpriced
[4256.92 --> 4257.56]  because of whatever.
[4258.10 --> 4258.98]  I'm going to have to go back
[4258.98 --> 4259.74]  and watch the archive
[4259.74 --> 4260.38]  and figure out
[4260.38 --> 4261.30]  what the crap I said.
[4261.78 --> 4263.20]  Okay, my point
[4263.20 --> 4265.36]  is that you can't just say
[4265.36 --> 4266.44]  something's overpriced
[4266.44 --> 4267.44]  because it's expensive.
[4268.36 --> 4268.78]  Yes.
[4268.94 --> 4270.14]  You cannot say that.
[4271.14 --> 4272.18]  That's stupid.
[4272.44 --> 4273.24]  Because it really...
[4273.24 --> 4273.52]  You can't do it.
[4273.56 --> 4273.78]  Yes.
[4274.10 --> 4275.52]  Because something could
[4275.52 --> 4277.50]  be very expensive,
[4278.02 --> 4279.38]  and it could still be a phone,
[4279.72 --> 4281.74]  and it could not be overpriced
[4281.74 --> 4284.70]  because whether it's full of gold
[4284.70 --> 4286.14]  or whether it is full
[4286.14 --> 4287.14]  of a bunch of technology
[4287.14 --> 4288.10]  that was very expensive
[4288.10 --> 4288.58]  to develop.
[4289.02 --> 4289.58]  You can say...
[4289.58 --> 4290.24]  There's the value of the components.
[4290.34 --> 4291.24]  You can say,
[4291.76 --> 4294.08]  that doesn't have a value to me,
[4294.26 --> 4294.88]  and therefore,
[4295.06 --> 4296.66]  I will not spend my money on it.
[4296.86 --> 4298.30]  But that doesn't mean
[4298.30 --> 4299.46]  it's overpriced.
[4299.62 --> 4302.86]  That means you don't want to buy it
[4302.86 --> 4304.56]  or you can't buy it
[4304.56 --> 4306.02]  because it costs too much
[4306.02 --> 4307.08]  for you to justify
[4307.08 --> 4308.22]  compared to the other things
[4308.22 --> 4308.80]  in your life.
[4308.92 --> 4310.02]  Like, for example,
[4310.22 --> 4310.80]  let's take...
[4310.80 --> 4312.58]  Okay, let's take the Model S.
[4313.20 --> 4313.88]  Great example.
[4314.16 --> 4315.04]  Is it overpriced?
[4315.34 --> 4315.80]  No.
[4316.26 --> 4317.72]  Is it too expensive for me?
[4317.96 --> 4318.28]  Yes.
[4318.42 --> 4318.68]  Yes.
[4318.82 --> 4319.50]  Is it...
[4319.50 --> 4320.60]  Okay, in this context,
[4320.76 --> 4322.26]  is it overpriced for me?
[4323.00 --> 4323.40]  Sure.
[4324.26 --> 4325.98]  So, like, for my means,
[4326.06 --> 4326.92]  it's overpriced.
[4327.02 --> 4328.10]  But that doesn't mean
[4328.10 --> 4329.38]  it's overpriced.
[4329.38 --> 4331.12]  It means it's just expensive.
[4331.52 --> 4332.14]  So there.
[4332.36 --> 4333.08]  That's the distinction
[4333.08 --> 4333.94]  I'm trying to make.
[4334.06 --> 4335.06]  The difference between
[4335.06 --> 4337.20]  overpriced and expensive
[4337.20 --> 4338.54]  deal with it,
[4338.74 --> 4339.24]  sunglasses,
[4339.64 --> 4341.28]  and they're not the same thing.
[4342.10 --> 4342.34]  Okay.
[4342.60 --> 4343.28]  So anyway,
[4343.44 --> 4344.68]  a lot of people say
[4344.68 --> 4347.34]  the iPhone is overpriced.
[4347.68 --> 4348.86]  But in this context,
[4349.06 --> 4350.06]  or in this case,
[4350.66 --> 4352.06]  Apple has delivered something
[4352.06 --> 4353.44]  that is truly different
[4353.44 --> 4354.36]  and truly unique
[4354.36 --> 4355.36]  in spite of the fact
[4355.36 --> 4356.86]  that it looks exactly
[4356.86 --> 4358.38]  the same thing
[4358.38 --> 4359.84]  as the previous damn iPhone.
[4359.94 --> 4360.72]  It looks like they haven't
[4360.72 --> 4361.44]  done a bloody thing,
[4361.52 --> 4361.88]  but they went...
[4361.88 --> 4363.00]  They developed a new processor.
[4363.38 --> 4365.00]  They developed a new storage solution
[4365.00 --> 4366.82]  that flips things on...
[4366.82 --> 4367.60]  That flips the industry
[4367.60 --> 4368.40]  on its head
[4368.40 --> 4369.14]  in a way that
[4369.14 --> 4369.92]  hasn't been done before.
[4370.00 --> 4371.30]  Much like Apple
[4371.30 --> 4372.32]  went and introduced
[4372.32 --> 4373.24]  the Retina display
[4373.24 --> 4374.08]  and then all of a sudden,
[4374.18 --> 4374.36]  like,
[4374.72 --> 4376.20]  the Android handset makers,
[4376.58 --> 4377.50]  they never know
[4377.50 --> 4378.30]  when it's been enough
[4378.30 --> 4378.98]  of a good thing.
[4379.08 --> 4379.54]  And they're like,
[4379.60 --> 4379.92]  okay,
[4380.56 --> 4381.68]  1080p,
[4382.02 --> 4383.28]  1440p,
[4383.34 --> 4383.66]  4K!
[4383.66 --> 4383.98]  More!
[4384.56 --> 4385.36]  And then Apple
[4385.36 --> 4386.14]  runs and goes,
[4386.56 --> 4386.94]  meanwhile,
[4387.52 --> 4388.28]  you idiots
[4388.28 --> 4389.12]  are all increasing
[4389.12 --> 4390.64]  your freaking screen resolution
[4390.64 --> 4391.50]  for no reason.
[4391.84 --> 4392.64]  We're going to go
[4392.64 --> 4393.86]  and make the storage faster.
[4394.06 --> 4394.88]  Which totally makes sense
[4394.88 --> 4395.86]  because in computers,
[4396.14 --> 4397.14]  if you're making a computer
[4397.14 --> 4397.52]  for someone
[4397.52 --> 4398.28]  who wants to do
[4398.28 --> 4398.94]  a lot of the things
[4398.94 --> 4399.58]  that you're going to be doing
[4399.58 --> 4399.92]  on a phone,
[4400.00 --> 4400.60]  not everything,
[4400.78 --> 4401.08]  I know,
[4401.18 --> 4401.82]  but a lot of the things
[4401.82 --> 4402.48]  you're doing on the phone,
[4402.82 --> 4404.06]  a lot of times in SSDs,
[4404.12 --> 4405.08]  their biggest upgrade.
[4405.24 --> 4405.42]  Yes.
[4405.76 --> 4406.28]  And as you know,
[4406.30 --> 4406.82]  it's really funny
[4406.82 --> 4407.40]  because people,
[4407.64 --> 4409.44]  everyone loves to get pissed off
[4409.44 --> 4409.96]  and be like,
[4410.36 --> 4411.74]  Apple never invented anything.
[4411.84 --> 4412.26]  And you know what?
[4412.28 --> 4412.88]  In this case,
[4412.92 --> 4414.58]  Apple didn't invent NVMe.
[4414.88 --> 4416.66]  They didn't invent SSDs.
[4416.78 --> 4417.82]  They didn't invent
[4417.82 --> 4418.60]  the concept
[4418.60 --> 4419.82]  of fast storage
[4419.82 --> 4420.52]  being important,
[4420.52 --> 4422.10]  but they ran out
[4422.10 --> 4423.08]  and they actually did it.
[4423.16 --> 4424.08]  They put it in a product
[4424.08 --> 4425.80]  and no one else had the balls.
[4425.94 --> 4426.38]  Someone in the chat
[4426.38 --> 4427.42]  is saying they didn't do that.
[4427.50 --> 4428.42]  Part of it was Samsung.
[4428.66 --> 4429.32]  It doesn't matter.
[4429.46 --> 4430.04]  It's in that phone.
[4431.04 --> 4431.74]  Who cares?
[4431.96 --> 4432.56]  It's in that phone.
[4432.72 --> 4434.14]  Apple cut the PO.
[4434.56 --> 4434.82]  Yeah.
[4435.00 --> 4435.94]  Apple put their money
[4435.94 --> 4436.98]  where their mouth was.
[4437.16 --> 4438.68]  They ordered the NAND chips.
[4438.86 --> 4440.00]  They ordered the controllers.
[4440.34 --> 4441.72]  They invested in the R&D
[4441.72 --> 4442.60]  to put it in a phone
[4442.60 --> 4443.72]  and they put it in a phone.
[4444.58 --> 4445.36]  No one else
[4445.36 --> 4446.28]  had the balls
[4446.28 --> 4447.10]  or the resources
[4447.10 --> 4448.86]  or some combination of the two
[4448.86 --> 4450.92]  to just do it.
[4451.12 --> 4452.06]  And that's what it sometimes
[4452.06 --> 4452.66]  comes down to.
[4452.74 --> 4454.10]  You don't have to invent it.
[4454.26 --> 4455.34]  You just have to do it.
[4455.64 --> 4456.58]  We didn't invent
[4456.58 --> 4457.86]  a weekly podcast.
[4458.64 --> 4459.02]  No.
[4459.46 --> 4460.78]  That concept existed
[4460.78 --> 4463.44]  since before I like
[4463.44 --> 4464.56]  knew how to,
[4465.04 --> 4465.60]  I don't know.
[4465.82 --> 4466.46]  I'm trying to come up
[4466.46 --> 4467.12]  with something internet related.
[4467.12 --> 4467.80]  Before you were a host
[4467.80 --> 4468.72]  of anything, I think.
[4468.84 --> 4469.38]  I've got people saying
[4469.38 --> 4470.08]  this topic sucks.
[4470.16 --> 4470.56]  I don't care.
[4470.92 --> 4471.84]  It's my podcast.
[4472.20 --> 4472.58]  So,
[4472.72 --> 4473.86]  and his too,
[4473.98 --> 4474.32]  actually.
[4474.50 --> 4474.86]  We share it.
[4474.86 --> 4475.02]  Aw.
[4475.26 --> 4475.70]  Aw.
[4475.70 --> 4476.22]  So,
[4476.22 --> 4477.00]  we didn't invent
[4477.00 --> 4477.64]  the concept
[4477.64 --> 4480.02]  of a video podcast,
[4480.40 --> 4482.12]  but we went and did it.
[4482.56 --> 4483.36]  We didn't invent
[4483.36 --> 4484.82]  the concept of YouTube videos.
[4484.94 --> 4485.12]  Yep.
[4485.30 --> 4486.30]  I definitely didn't invent YouTube.
[4486.30 --> 4486.76]  We didn't invent the concept
[4486.76 --> 4487.80]  of unboxings.
[4488.00 --> 4488.30]  Nope.
[4488.54 --> 4488.82]  Nope.
[4489.26 --> 4489.76]  In fact,
[4489.84 --> 4491.00]  I just did unboxings
[4491.00 --> 4492.64]  because I was like,
[4492.70 --> 4494.18]  I need to do product overviews
[4494.18 --> 4494.96]  and I need a keyword
[4494.96 --> 4496.92]  that's like somewhat useful.
[4497.72 --> 4497.96]  Yeah.
[4498.42 --> 4499.08]  People are like,
[4499.16 --> 4500.32]  we hate this topic.
[4500.72 --> 4501.62]  And other people are like,
[4501.68 --> 4502.86]  I love this topic.
[4503.42 --> 4504.50]  Want to talk about something
[4504.50 --> 4505.62]  that we used to hate
[4505.62 --> 4507.62]  and that is hopefully
[4507.62 --> 4508.90]  getting less worse.
[4509.00 --> 4509.90]  What are we talking about?
[4510.04 --> 4511.26]  Need for Speed from EA.
[4511.56 --> 4512.14]  Oh, yes.
[4512.16 --> 4513.18]  This isn't in the doc,
[4513.48 --> 4514.76]  but I'll throw the link
[4514.76 --> 4515.32]  in the chat
[4515.32 --> 4516.44]  and you should be able
[4516.44 --> 4517.54]  to Google this pretty easily.
[4517.72 --> 4518.38]  The one I'm looking at
[4518.38 --> 4519.22]  is on PC Gamer.
[4519.52 --> 4520.34]  Just look at PC Gamer
[4520.34 --> 4520.90]  Need for Speed.
[4521.02 --> 4521.28]  You should be able
[4521.28 --> 4521.70]  to find it.
[4521.70 --> 4521.82]  Sure.
[4522.24 --> 4523.00]  I'll throw it
[4523.00 --> 4524.10]  in the Twitch chat.
[4524.56 --> 4525.62]  This was like,
[4525.86 --> 4526.24]  ah,
[4526.56 --> 4526.96]  I didn't,
[4527.04 --> 4528.40]  my brain is like
[4528.40 --> 4529.42]  not okay
[4529.42 --> 4530.38]  with accepting this,
[4530.48 --> 4531.22]  but EA looks like
[4531.22 --> 4532.22]  they're doing cool things,
[4533.00 --> 4534.36]  which is good.
[4534.50 --> 4535.26]  We have to give them
[4535.26 --> 4536.38]  credit for doing cool things.
[4536.78 --> 4537.22]  I just,
[4537.42 --> 4538.34]  I have trust issues
[4538.34 --> 4539.50]  when it comes to EA.
[4540.04 --> 4541.12]  Are you going to pre-order?
[4542.04 --> 4542.52]  No,
[4542.80 --> 4543.50]  I will not.
[4544.34 --> 4545.10]  Need for Speed
[4545.10 --> 4547.26]  is not going to have
[4547.26 --> 4549.12]  any microtransactions
[4549.12 --> 4549.70]  in the game.
[4549.80 --> 4550.80]  They're saying that for sure,
[4550.90 --> 4551.76]  but they're saying it
[4551.76 --> 4553.66]  probably won't have
[4553.66 --> 4554.26]  paid DLC.
[4554.60 --> 4555.62]  So I'm going to go with
[4555.62 --> 4556.22]  there's probably going
[4556.22 --> 4556.94]  to be paid DLC.
[4557.16 --> 4558.14]  And car customization
[4558.14 --> 4560.22]  is like huge
[4560.22 --> 4561.02]  and expansive
[4561.02 --> 4562.04]  and awesome.
[4562.42 --> 4563.52]  And it looks like
[4563.52 --> 4564.66]  an old Need for Speed game.
[4564.94 --> 4565.64]  And that makes me
[4565.64 --> 4566.14]  really excited.
[4566.20 --> 4567.34]  Right down to the shiny road.
[4567.56 --> 4567.88]  Yeah.
[4568.32 --> 4569.10]  That's cool.
[4569.26 --> 4570.00]  I don't care.
[4570.58 --> 4571.64]  This whole time,
[4571.70 --> 4572.40]  I've just wanted like
[4572.40 --> 4573.56]  the old school style
[4573.56 --> 4574.30]  Need for Speed games.
[4574.68 --> 4577.42]  And I saw an example
[4577.42 --> 4578.30]  of someone driving around
[4578.30 --> 4579.44]  and the car physics
[4579.44 --> 4580.24]  looked ridiculous.
[4580.36 --> 4580.74]  And I was like,
[4580.82 --> 4581.14]  yay,
[4581.22 --> 4581.76]  thank you.
[4582.16 --> 4583.46]  You know what's really funny
[4583.46 --> 4584.46]  about this
[4584.46 --> 4586.38]  is that all EA
[4586.38 --> 4587.70]  ever had to do
[4587.70 --> 4588.96]  to make Need for Speed
[4588.96 --> 4589.80]  fans happy
[4589.80 --> 4591.44]  is apply
[4591.44 --> 4593.32]  their NHL
[4593.32 --> 4594.30]  NBA
[4594.30 --> 4595.70]  formula
[4595.70 --> 4596.48]  to Need for Speed.
[4596.48 --> 4596.66]  Yeah.
[4596.92 --> 4597.54]  Here it is.
[4597.62 --> 4598.48]  The same game,
[4598.62 --> 4599.18]  new roster.
[4599.56 --> 4599.96]  Please.
[4600.16 --> 4600.62]  And they would have,
[4600.72 --> 4601.66]  people would have actually
[4601.66 --> 4602.52]  just been happy.
[4602.62 --> 4603.38]  Every time I played
[4603.38 --> 4604.06]  a Need for Speed game
[4604.06 --> 4604.52]  back in the day,
[4604.54 --> 4604.78]  I was like,
[4604.90 --> 4605.22]  wow,
[4605.44 --> 4606.74]  this storyline's terrible
[4606.74 --> 4607.88]  and I love it.
[4608.52 --> 4610.04]  Because that's not the point.
[4610.04 --> 4612.64]  And I want to not feel bad
[4612.64 --> 4614.06]  for skipping cutscenes ever
[4614.06 --> 4614.98]  and I just want to go
[4614.98 --> 4616.22]  into some crazy race
[4616.22 --> 4617.14]  and then have cops
[4617.14 --> 4618.06]  chase me for no reason
[4618.06 --> 4618.96]  and then have things
[4618.96 --> 4619.74]  blow up.
[4620.04 --> 4620.28]  No reason,
[4620.42 --> 4620.88]  you're speeding.
[4621.56 --> 4623.10]  Smash into some other car
[4623.10 --> 4624.38]  and then be like,
[4624.48 --> 4624.76]  lol,
[4624.94 --> 4625.74]  I'll just go around the corner
[4625.74 --> 4626.70]  and my car's fine anyways
[4626.70 --> 4628.22]  and be going so fast
[4628.22 --> 4628.92]  in one of the games
[4628.92 --> 4630.40]  that grinding against the wall
[4630.40 --> 4631.18]  to go around the corner
[4631.18 --> 4632.22]  was actually more effective
[4632.22 --> 4632.84]  than braking.
[4633.44 --> 4634.14]  Need for Speed.
[4634.86 --> 4635.84]  That was awesome.
[4635.94 --> 4636.64]  I'm just trying to picture
[4636.64 --> 4637.50]  you getting pulled over
[4637.50 --> 4638.20]  by a cop.
[4638.70 --> 4639.02]  And be like,
[4639.06 --> 4639.78]  there was no reason.
[4639.78 --> 4640.52]  There was no reason
[4640.52 --> 4640.54]  for you to pull me over.
[4640.54 --> 4641.36]  I was only going
[4641.36 --> 4642.60]  200 miles an hour.
[4642.72 --> 4642.90]  Yeah.
[4644.66 --> 4645.10]  Alright,
[4645.28 --> 4646.18]  well I think that pretty much
[4646.18 --> 4646.72]  wraps it up
[4646.72 --> 4647.98]  for our topics today.
[4649.38 --> 4649.78]  Yeah,
[4649.82 --> 4650.54]  I got nothing else.
[4650.62 --> 4651.60]  Thank you guys very much
[4651.60 --> 4652.30]  for tuning in.
[4652.56 --> 4653.40]  We will see you again
[4653.40 --> 4653.96]  next week.
[4654.08 --> 4654.96]  Same bat time,
[4655.34 --> 4656.72]  same bat channel.
[4659.46 --> 4659.82]  Vote.
[4659.82 --> 4674.28]  I have to film three fastest
[4674.28 --> 4677.36]  possibles right now.
[4677.36 --> 4690.96]  and I also am tired,
[4690.96 --> 4694.24]  so maybe we'll just do a very...
[4694.24 --> 4697.76] maan Bo cercada.
[4697.84 --> 4699.22]  I have to do a sets.
[4711.58 --> 4711.80]  If you're here,
[4711.86 --> 4712.30]  I have to climb,
[4712.40 --> 4712.90]  I will dock you again
[4713.02 --> 4714.16]  to get out to heal.
[4714.16 --> 4714.68]  If you are close to that inch file,
[4714.96 --> 4715.84]  I could go following my professional
[4715.98 --> 4717.20]  because this is too much
[4717.20 --> 4718.32]  coming in your space.
[4718.98 --> 4720.14]  I villan over here and one
[4720.14 --> 4720.84]  really gets me
[4721.10 --> 4721.66]  open.
