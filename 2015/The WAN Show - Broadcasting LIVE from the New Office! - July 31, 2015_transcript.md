[0.00 --> 0.74]  The whole time.
[1.04 --> 2.28]  That would be sick.
[2.46 --> 6.32]  That would actually be an excellent show, probably.
[6.50 --> 6.58]  Burkle.
[7.08 --> 8.46]  Yeah, Burkle would watch it.
[8.64 --> 9.94]  No, I'm saying Burkle should do it.
[10.06 --> 10.30]  Yeah.
[11.68 --> 16.30]  I don't know if I want to encourage him to do any more downhill biking than he already does.
[16.34 --> 16.60]  I do.
[16.68 --> 19.48]  If he ruins his legs, he can just wheelchair into his editing chair.
[19.48 --> 20.28]  Forget his legs.
[20.70 --> 25.24]  He could have ruined his entire self in that last accident.
[25.24 --> 27.78]  You can't not do things because they're scary.
[27.78 --> 30.70]  I think he should keep downhill biking.
[30.90 --> 34.32]  I think he should not break himself, but I do think he should keep biking.
[34.74 --> 36.12]  So, they've actually...
[36.12 --> 37.14]  This is kind of funny.
[37.34 --> 41.82]  A number of you have been asking about this.
[41.94 --> 42.50]  No orange.
[42.66 --> 47.68]  To be clear, this is actually not the WAN show set at the new office.
[47.68 --> 52.32]  Should I pick up the camera and look out the window and stuff, or should I super not?
[52.40 --> 53.58]  You know what we could do?
[54.28 --> 55.06]  No way.
[55.28 --> 56.30]  We could do this.
[56.30 --> 58.80]  Where is my other capture card?
[59.18 --> 59.42]  Okay.
[59.60 --> 60.66]  It's in inventory.
[61.76 --> 62.84]  Do you want to...
[62.84 --> 65.44]  What would be the best way to do this?
[66.06 --> 69.10]  Brandon has a wireless HDMI thing.
[69.22 --> 69.38]  Oh.
[69.68 --> 74.72]  So, maybe like a special sneak peek at moving vlog stuff that...
[74.72 --> 77.52]  Well, mind you, we've got moving vlog coming out like every day right now.
[77.52 --> 79.78]  I just wanted to show this room to show how temporary it was.
[79.78 --> 81.16]  Sure, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[81.16 --> 81.90]  Sure, sure, sure.
[82.40 --> 83.34]  Show them the room.
[83.44 --> 84.16]  Show them what's up.
[85.16 --> 89.70]  Get your landmarks for where the framing goes so that you can put it back easily.
[89.70 --> 90.54]  Oh, I can't see.
[91.38 --> 92.68]  There's a menu on here.
[92.88 --> 93.16]  Oh.
[94.74 --> 96.12]  I'm going to not move it.
[96.20 --> 96.62]  Sure.
[97.30 --> 97.74]  Okay.
[97.74 --> 99.86]  Never mind, you don't get to see anything.
[100.08 --> 101.04]  But it's super temporary.
[101.04 --> 103.26]  Yeah, it's basically, it's horrible.
[103.56 --> 103.82]  Yeah.
[104.82 --> 106.42]  Wait, I have a new solution.
[106.84 --> 107.00]  What?
[107.04 --> 107.86]  Okay, I'll be right back.
[107.90 --> 108.48]  I'll be right back.
[108.56 --> 108.88]  Okay.
[109.88 --> 111.70]  I don't know how far away he's going.
[111.84 --> 113.70]  Okay, he's going pretty far away.
[114.96 --> 119.72]  Basically, we're in what's going to be, I think, this is the library.
[120.94 --> 122.26]  Ed's looking at me through the window.
[122.48 --> 123.82]  I think windows here is going to be really weird.
[123.92 --> 124.78]  Can you hear me at all?
[125.80 --> 126.64]  Can you hear me?
[127.68 --> 129.02]  Is this the library?
[131.04 --> 135.26]  Yes.
[135.44 --> 135.90]  Yes, okay.
[136.00 --> 140.50]  So we're in what will be eventually the library, which isn't really going to be a library at all.
[140.68 --> 143.14]  It's actually just going to be kind of a quiet area.
[143.32 --> 143.60]  Dude.
[144.06 --> 146.30]  So I walk past John.
[146.42 --> 147.02]  Oh, cool.
[147.22 --> 152.10]  And, oh, I have, I can unplug my mouse.
[152.26 --> 152.90]  Nope, it's all good.
[153.14 --> 158.62]  So I walk past John and I hear on his headphones, no, wait, I have a solution.
[158.62 --> 163.72]  Right as I get over there and implement my solution.
[164.14 --> 166.54]  I'm like, John, why are you watching Wanshu?
[166.76 --> 168.30]  He's supposed to be moving things.
[168.58 --> 172.08]  So we are still not quite done.
[172.18 --> 174.34]  We're still not quite done the move.
[174.48 --> 174.64]  Yeah.
[174.64 --> 176.12]  It's coming very soon.
[176.12 --> 176.36]  Quite done.
[176.80 --> 179.00]  We still have a ton more in there.
[179.02 --> 179.04]  Sorry.
[179.04 --> 180.06]  I meant to say inventory.
[180.26 --> 181.76]  We're not quite done inventory.
[182.18 --> 183.78]  Like none of the desks are built.
[184.00 --> 185.54]  None of the computers are rebuilt.
[186.36 --> 188.30]  None of the monitors are unpacked.
[188.58 --> 192.78]  There's, yeah, there's huge amounts of work still to be done.
[192.78 --> 196.76]  But, yes, most things are actually in inventory.
[197.06 --> 201.58]  And that, I guess, is another teaser for the hot dog day.
[202.34 --> 202.86]  Yes.
[203.72 --> 203.96]  Yeah.
[204.08 --> 210.48]  So for those of you who don't know, there will be, we actually haven't confirmed hot dogs.
[210.74 --> 213.98]  There are some potential liability issues with serving food.
[214.28 --> 214.48]  Oh.
[214.48 --> 219.48]  Yeah, because we're not a licensed, established restaurant and beverage.
[219.48 --> 221.34]  So, chip bags and pop.
[221.56 --> 225.48]  So, so basically, yeah, it's, it's really not certain what kind of.
[225.48 --> 225.84]  Wait, what?
[226.18 --> 227.06]  This is like bull crap.
[227.16 --> 229.66]  Because like every bank or whatever will have like.
[230.04 --> 231.58]  Yeah, you might have to get a.
[231.68 --> 232.86]  But, okay, we're looking into it.
[233.10 --> 234.26]  Oh, you might need like a caterer.
[234.26 --> 236.52]  You might need like a permit or like something.
[236.64 --> 237.28]  I don't know.
[237.54 --> 238.50]  I don't know.
[238.60 --> 240.28]  I don't know if we're going to have time to deal with it.
[240.30 --> 244.22]  My bank is legitimately small enough that I could probably ask whoever runs it how they do it.
[244.48 --> 245.24]  Okay.
[245.32 --> 249.12]  Well, either way, I haven't actually promised food in any way.
[249.26 --> 249.36]  Okay.
[249.36 --> 249.66]  My bad.
[249.76 --> 251.58]  What will definitely be happening.
[251.60 --> 252.06]  Bing day.
[252.20 --> 253.00]  Is a meetup.
[253.26 --> 255.46]  So we're doing a meetup on August 21st.
[255.80 --> 259.62]  We're all going to roll into work a little late, like maybe noonish.
[259.90 --> 261.22]  And then we're going to work a little late.
[261.22 --> 264.86]  So people who work can, can swing by a little bit later on in the day.
[265.00 --> 268.48]  There will also be an accompanying garage sale.
[268.68 --> 269.00]  Yes.
[269.62 --> 270.10]  Yes.
[270.16 --> 270.48]  Yeah.
[270.48 --> 276.32]  The legendary garage sale that we've been talking about since we were supposed to be moving.
[276.52 --> 278.32]  Someone in chat says you can get one from City Hall.
[279.22 --> 279.48]  Okay.
[279.58 --> 280.42]  Well, whatever.
[280.74 --> 282.58]  I straight up don't know if we're going to have time.
[283.24 --> 285.26]  So forget about the food for now.
[285.60 --> 286.56]  It may or may not happen.
[286.70 --> 286.86]  Yeah.
[286.92 --> 287.90]  If it's there, it's a bonus.
[288.00 --> 288.90]  I'm promising nothing.
[289.12 --> 290.28]  You can bring your own food.
[290.36 --> 291.92]  You could certainly bring food.
[291.92 --> 294.38]  But what there will be is a meetup.
[294.52 --> 296.12]  What there will be is a garage sale.
[296.26 --> 299.66]  So we need to get rid of some space consuming stuff.
[300.04 --> 306.20]  We're also potentially, depending on what the demand is, potentially going to do tours of the new office.
[306.72 --> 315.96]  So in small groups, if people want to come around accompanied by someone, they'll be able to check out where the magic will be happening from now on.
[315.96 --> 317.48]  So that is happening on August 21st.
[317.48 --> 322.72]  You know how museums and stuff will have the airport line management things?
[322.90 --> 323.38]  That would be sick.
[323.52 --> 325.62]  We should just do it with Ethernet cables.
[326.80 --> 330.24]  Just tape Ethernet cables over certain doors you can't go in.
[330.24 --> 347.36]  If I didn't think that someone somewhere was going to murder you for wrecking their awesome cable wrapping job by unwrapping all the cables, then I would say sure.
[348.58 --> 356.44]  Berkley spent two days, entire days, working on wrapping up cables and categorizing them correctly.
[357.36 --> 358.50]  It's awesome, though.
[358.56 --> 360.18]  I needed a power squid for this room.
[360.24 --> 361.94]  And it was just instantly available.
[362.16 --> 362.38]  Yep.
[362.62 --> 365.12]  Everything is a place for everything.
[365.28 --> 366.22]  Everything in its place.
[366.30 --> 366.52]  Okay.
[366.96 --> 370.44]  So here's my solution to checking out this room.
[370.48 --> 370.72]  Hold on.
[370.76 --> 371.32]  Let me just fix this.
[371.36 --> 373.42]  I'm going to try not to make you guys too nauseated.
[373.98 --> 377.98]  So in the ceiling, you can see that many of the ceiling tiles.
[378.44 --> 381.58]  Well, you would be able to see that if it wasn't for the, yeah, there we go.
[381.88 --> 382.50]  For the light there.
[382.50 --> 384.84]  Many of the ceiling tiles are missing.
[385.16 --> 388.80]  That is so that we can get our final inspection at a later time.
[388.80 --> 395.48]  You can also see things like that glass door has a big blue X on it.
[395.68 --> 397.98]  There's a wire sticking out of the wall.
[398.46 --> 401.48]  There is debris on the floor.
[401.94 --> 403.60]  And a fan because we still don't have air conditioning.
[403.60 --> 405.64]  It is so hot.
[405.82 --> 406.44]  Really hot.
[406.56 --> 411.78]  It is so, here is me trying to get the WAN show going quickly.
[412.28 --> 414.70]  Just dumping things out of my bag.
[414.70 --> 422.54]  Oh, and some people commented on Luke's sick chair with the Linus Tech Tips embroidery.
[423.30 --> 430.44]  That was one brand's attempt to win us over for the chairs that we're going to be using for the new office.
[430.44 --> 433.38]  But we actually didn't go with them.
[433.52 --> 443.10]  We ended up going with Maxnomic just because we found that out of all the, like, racing, gamery-looking chairs that we've tried, they were the most comfortable.
[443.76 --> 446.16]  And the construction on them is really, really solid.
[446.30 --> 447.66]  So we ended up going that route.
[448.70 --> 449.76]  Everyone saw my knife.
[450.54 --> 452.76]  Oh, are they talking about your knife or my knife?
[453.32 --> 454.06]  Possibly your knife.
[454.06 --> 456.98]  Because my knife was also sitting on the floor when I panned around to my bag.
[457.08 --> 458.06]  Probably your knife, thanks.
[458.70 --> 459.16]  There you go.
[459.42 --> 460.42]  Yeah, I really like this knife.
[460.48 --> 461.22]  I got it on Mass Drop.
[461.32 --> 463.18]  They're not a sponsor today, though, so I don't have to talk about them.
[463.84 --> 464.32]  All right.
[464.42 --> 467.72]  So why don't we actually do, why don't we actually do a topic here?
[467.78 --> 471.88]  I'm going to pull the, yeah, I don't, you know, guys.
[471.88 --> 476.32]  Another thing that we should do on WAN show sometime, we should do the WAN show about people that were late.
[476.62 --> 480.70]  And we should do a WAN show where the entire time we are almost starting a topic.
[480.70 --> 483.44]  And we never actually complete any topic.
[484.28 --> 488.04]  We should always just almost lead into one and then sidetrack every time.
[488.08 --> 488.76]  The time stamp.
[489.26 --> 493.08]  You know, the thing about that idea is now that you've said it, it won't happen.
[493.50 --> 495.06]  But we could do it in like a year.
[495.36 --> 497.60]  No, but it could have easily happened on its own.
[497.74 --> 498.76]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[498.80 --> 499.44]  I mean, how many.
[499.46 --> 500.56]  I think we've been pretty close.
[500.66 --> 505.46]  How many times have we been trying to talk about some kind of actual topic on this show,
[505.64 --> 510.26]  only to be led into like, I mean, okay, get this.
[510.26 --> 517.48]  The access points that we're using for the new office, they're made by Xclaim.
[517.88 --> 522.00]  So I actually reviewed it, the XI3 fairly recently.
[522.44 --> 523.32]  Love it.
[523.66 --> 525.44]  The hardware is awesome.
[525.98 --> 535.26]  It is basically almost exactly the same hardware as like some ruckus access point that is pretty much just badass.
[536.64 --> 537.84]  Which is slightly limited, right?
[537.84 --> 541.82]  Yeah, the rated speeds are not amazing, but it actually does it.
[541.82 --> 547.34]  And it can handle boatloads of clients and lots of traffic much more gracefully than a consumer-grade access point.
[547.38 --> 552.98]  Anyway, the point is it lacks the management capabilities of the higher-end ruckus gear,
[553.26 --> 557.50]  which is why you're paying like a third as much or whatever that works out to for awesome hardware.
[557.50 --> 564.30]  So one of the things that's missing is like a super awesome management interface.
[564.74 --> 570.34]  And I went and put a couple of already configured access points.
[571.62 --> 572.60]  What is that?
[573.58 --> 577.54]  25, 28 feet up in the rafters of this building?
[577.54 --> 582.96]  And the way that it works with Xclaim is that it's app-based.
[583.72 --> 588.50]  And the phone that I configured them with, that I believe it's tied to unless something,
[588.94 --> 592.28]  the phone I configured it with has been formatted since then.
[592.48 --> 601.64]  So I'm going to have to get a scissor lift to hit or hit that button on my access point unless...
[601.64 --> 602.24]  All of them?
[602.24 --> 603.68]  Unless there's only two up there.
[603.74 --> 604.06]  Okay.
[604.18 --> 605.96]  Unless Xclaim can walk me through this.
[606.02 --> 608.14]  Now they've said I should be able to do it.
[608.34 --> 608.62]  Okay.
[608.72 --> 613.14]  But I have tried getting into the web console, which does exist, even though it's bare bones.
[613.46 --> 620.68]  The problem is I think one of mine might be really old inventory that doesn't have the firmware update yet.
[620.80 --> 627.40]  Or something like it's just a serendipitous comedy of errors thing.
[627.56 --> 629.34]  Are you allowed to just grab one of the scissor lifts?
[629.34 --> 634.14]  Yes, but the problem is that our inventory system is in the way of the one in the back corner.
[634.28 --> 634.60]  Whoa.
[635.32 --> 636.96]  So, yeah.
[637.16 --> 639.50]  Because, like, they're really easy to operate.
[639.92 --> 641.78]  Yeah, it's been just one thing after another.
[642.06 --> 643.74]  Like, I mean, this is really great.
[643.74 --> 653.76]  So, the editors have been bothering me for access to the archive, to the Vault server, all week.
[654.02 --> 656.66]  And I've just been like, yeah, I'll get to it, yeah, I'll get to it, yeah, I'll get to it.
[656.68 --> 664.56]  The problem is that the Vault server uses an SFP Plus network card.
[665.26 --> 667.88]  This episode brought to you by McDonald's.
[667.88 --> 672.96]  Delicious dollar drinks for only a dollar, as large as you can drink.
[673.44 --> 677.28]  And ice cream that is a little bit melted because heat is a thing.
[677.50 --> 677.68]  Yep.
[677.80 --> 678.64]  And this room is hot.
[678.74 --> 687.22]  Luke, don't expect him to participate much for the next little bit unless he wants dripping white liquid running down his face and hands.
[687.22 --> 692.62]  That wouldn't be terrible, but, like, I don't really want to be that sticky when I can't even shower here.
[692.78 --> 692.92]  Oh, that's good.
[692.92 --> 693.82]  We should get a shower here.
[694.26 --> 694.94]  You know what?
[695.02 --> 696.98]  It's something that we literally could do.
[697.64 --> 697.90]  I know.
[697.92 --> 704.50]  Because I was actually thinking, so right now we have two bathrooms, which is a huge improvement over the last office.
[704.56 --> 714.58]  You know what's really funny is so many people have been saying, like, one of the things they're really looking forward to about the new office is more than one bathroom.
[714.58 --> 716.32]  Funny story.
[717.28 --> 719.70]  The old office has two bathrooms.
[720.02 --> 720.82]  Three, actually.
[721.16 --> 721.44]  Yes.
[721.84 --> 728.08]  So it had three bathrooms, one of which was completely functional and completely accessible.
[728.62 --> 733.74]  The reason that people weren't allowed to use it was because no one would clean it.
[733.74 --> 746.94]  So absolutely, and since we're going to have exactly the same issue here and we're going to probably get, like, a cleaning service or something to deal with that, nothing would have prevented us from just having the cleaning service at the old place.
[746.94 --> 758.74]  But the problem is, much like the window-mounted air conditioning, I kept getting updates from our construction company that we were, you know, two weeks or three weeks out or whatever.
[758.92 --> 759.32]  And so I wasn't...
[759.32 --> 770.18]  I do want to say that my dad, like, peeked through the window and gave a time estimate, which is probably still going to be on track for, like, exactly correct.
[770.18 --> 771.18]  Oh.
[772.74 --> 781.02]  So it's been very frustrating that no one other than Luke's dad, who didn't share this information with me, knew when our...
[781.02 --> 783.02]  I told you and you were like, no, no, no, it'll be three weeks.
[784.08 --> 785.12]  And he was like, two months.
[785.24 --> 787.08]  What I said was, no, no, no, they say.
[787.22 --> 787.94]  Okay, okay.
[788.16 --> 790.52]  Because I was pretty skeptical, too.
[790.58 --> 791.02]  That's fair.
[791.02 --> 793.84]  That's all I had to go on, right?
[794.98 --> 798.86]  So, um, so, what was I, what was I even talking about?
[798.94 --> 800.06]  Right, the bathrooms?
[800.48 --> 800.64]  Yeah.
[800.80 --> 802.06]  People are excited about bathrooms.
[802.06 --> 802.78]  Two bathrooms, yeah.
[802.88 --> 803.42]  Yeah, no.
[803.42 --> 804.20]  Oh, right, the shower.
[804.20 --> 804.76]  I want a cot and a shower.
[805.08 --> 806.18]  Yeah, no cot.
[806.32 --> 808.18]  But there will be a sectional in the library.
[808.34 --> 808.82]  That works.
[809.04 --> 809.20]  Yep.
[810.38 --> 813.06]  And there's a new plan for the conference room.
[813.20 --> 816.60]  So we are no longer building up that thing to be a bench.
[816.60 --> 822.14]  What we're going to have, and Esther mapped it out and drew it out, and it looks like
[822.14 --> 825.74]  it'll work with enough room for chairs, is we're actually going to have kind of a figure
[825.74 --> 826.70]  eight shaped table.
[828.08 --> 833.50]  So the people sitting on the side with less space can scooch their chairs back towards
[833.50 --> 834.58]  each other to get out.
[835.94 --> 836.58]  They're okay.
[836.96 --> 837.22]  Yeah.
[837.90 --> 839.00]  So that's the new plan.
[840.08 --> 840.80]  Should be good.
[841.04 --> 842.04]  That sounds super weird.
[842.72 --> 844.42]  Yeah, I actually kind of like the idea.
[844.56 --> 845.64]  It's like, I don't know.
[845.64 --> 850.66]  And if you have a smaller group, it won't feel quite so big with a square table.
[850.98 --> 853.72]  Because it's very rare that we're going to have a meeting with 10 people in there.
[853.72 --> 854.16]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[854.18 --> 854.32]  Yeah.
[855.16 --> 856.14]  So I don't know.
[856.32 --> 858.94]  Because even Monday morning meetings should probably just be in the warehouse.
[859.30 --> 859.62]  Mm-hmm.
[860.08 --> 860.44]  Yeah.
[860.62 --> 861.54]  Or in the editing den.
[861.72 --> 862.52]  They can be anywhere.
[862.66 --> 863.46]  Everyone can just stand.
[863.50 --> 865.14]  Somewhere where you can stand a bunch of people.
[865.16 --> 866.04]  Yeah, they're like 10 minutes long.
[866.10 --> 866.24]  Yeah.
[866.52 --> 868.56]  Back to your shower request.
[868.96 --> 869.12]  Yes.
[869.12 --> 873.88]  So I was actually thinking, two bathrooms, by the time we have 15 people working here
[873.88 --> 877.04]  or whatever, actually isn't necessarily even that great.
[877.18 --> 881.02]  Especially when you might have any upwards of three to five people working in the warehouse
[881.02 --> 881.84]  at any given time.
[882.16 --> 886.30]  So I was kind of thinking, because this is actually three separate units, we could just
[886.30 --> 893.16]  build a little standing shower and toilet and sink box and bring water in.
[893.16 --> 896.42]  Because I want to bring a water line in from the main mechanical room.
[896.50 --> 898.44]  Because we actually don't have water in the warehouse.
[898.44 --> 898.72]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[898.88 --> 899.84]  All we have are sinks.
[900.12 --> 903.90]  So I was thinking we have like an industrial sink sitting on the other side of the wall.
[904.32 --> 908.06]  And then we have the plumbing for like a shower and a toilet and a sink in there.
[908.06 --> 911.54]  The reason why I want a shower, I don't know why we're talking about this on my show,
[911.58 --> 916.62]  but whatever, is for people that might either bike to work or go work out before work starts.
[916.82 --> 919.14]  And you're not the first person to request it.
[919.14 --> 920.94]  I've also requested it months ago.
[921.28 --> 923.28]  I realized why we wouldn't do it immediately.
[923.48 --> 924.42]  It would just be pretty cool.
[924.62 --> 926.70]  I also want a cot so that I can sleep here.
[927.02 --> 927.24]  Yeah.
[927.44 --> 929.24]  And then I just never have to leave because there's a shower.
[929.70 --> 932.02]  And then I could like store toothpaste and stuff somewhere.
[932.02 --> 935.12]  This is all part of your plan to game stream from here.
[935.22 --> 935.36]  Yep.
[935.56 --> 937.20]  Like late into the night, isn't it?
[937.28 --> 937.44]  Yep.
[938.36 --> 941.18]  I knew it was going to be a mistake to give you a key to this place.
[943.14 --> 944.76]  That's exactly what I'm going to be doing.
[945.08 --> 945.64]  I don't know.
[946.30 --> 948.92]  I've got people saying, we don't care about your bathroom.
[948.92 --> 949.88]  Where's the tech news?
[950.38 --> 953.68]  Well, 6,000 people apparently care about our bathroom.
[954.34 --> 958.06]  You know what's funny is, speaking of caring about the bathroom, for those of you who aren't
[958.06 --> 966.08]  on Vessel, I think at least two of the new office moving vlogs have footage of the insides
[966.08 --> 966.98]  of toilets in them.
[967.84 --> 970.00]  It is 100% Terrence's fault.
[970.42 --> 970.92]  What the?
[971.04 --> 972.88]  100% Terrence's fault.
[972.94 --> 973.30]  Why?
[973.94 --> 977.00]  Well, one of them I get, and might have been my idea.
[978.82 --> 980.34]  Well, he pointed the camera at it.
[980.38 --> 981.28]  That makes it his fault.
[981.38 --> 988.36]  It's like, if it's my idea to, you know, rid the world of Justin Bieber, if someone else
[988.36 --> 991.56]  points a gun at him and pulls the trigger, I mean, I can't take responsibility for that.
[991.60 --> 992.74]  Lots of people had that idea.
[993.74 --> 994.06]  Right.
[994.06 --> 996.14]  And I didn't pay him to do it.
[996.16 --> 997.66]  Well, I guess I did pay Terrence to.
[997.68 --> 998.20]  You did pay him.
[998.40 --> 998.96]  I did pay Terrence.
[998.96 --> 1000.66]  And did you give him an order to do it?
[1002.12 --> 1003.28]  Because that's a little bit different.
[1003.30 --> 1005.02]  Well, what I said was point the camera at the toilet.
[1005.28 --> 1006.58]  So you told him to do it.
[1007.22 --> 1010.48]  You specifically told him to do it and were paying him to do so.
[1010.56 --> 1010.82]  Right.
[1010.94 --> 1013.00]  But, see, I've had this conversation with all of you.
[1013.04 --> 1014.62]  I have all kinds of terrible ideas.
[1014.62 --> 1020.82]  My expectation from my team is that they will apply, you know, a filter to the things that
[1020.82 --> 1021.30]  I say.
[1021.88 --> 1023.96]  I know, but you went to the kill Justin Bieber thing.
[1024.96 --> 1026.68]  Well, you know, that's a whole other issue.
[1026.82 --> 1027.98]  I think you're changing the subject.
[1027.98 --> 1028.68]  You're changing the subject.
[1028.68 --> 1034.00]  If you were a commander and you told a soldier to point and shoot the gun, you can't completely
[1034.00 --> 1034.64]  absolve yourself.
[1034.64 --> 1035.56]  Does this look like the military to you?
[1035.96 --> 1038.22]  You just kill someone analogy.
[1038.70 --> 1040.22]  You think Justin Bieber's in the army.
[1040.52 --> 1042.82]  You think Justin Bieber would last a day in the army.
[1043.10 --> 1043.24]  No.
[1043.24 --> 1044.82]  I did not say he's in the army.
[1045.40 --> 1045.92]  I did not.
[1045.94 --> 1053.14]  So, anyway, the reason that that one was interesting was that it was the toilet that it was in
[1053.14 --> 1053.90]  the server room.
[1054.12 --> 1060.98]  So it had been not, the lid had never been opened for like two years since we put the
[1060.98 --> 1062.14]  printer on top of it.
[1063.34 --> 1065.98]  So I was like, I wonder what's in there.
[1067.26 --> 1071.88]  Dried on, caked on, probably remnants of whatever eats fecal matter.
[1071.88 --> 1077.04]  Because I suspect the fecal matter would have been consumed by some kind of bacteria, which
[1077.04 --> 1078.22]  would have been died probably.
[1079.74 --> 1080.10]  Okay.
[1081.00 --> 1082.84]  Ed is apparently Instagramming us.
[1085.00 --> 1086.14]  Show the McDonald's stuff.
[1086.20 --> 1086.86]  It's for the sponsorship.
[1087.00 --> 1087.96]  I pulled the thing off.
[1088.54 --> 1089.24]  No, I'm just kidding.
[1089.28 --> 1090.18]  There's no McDonald's sponsorship.
[1090.18 --> 1090.94]  I do that every time.
[1091.04 --> 1091.38]  I don't know why.
[1093.46 --> 1096.16]  No, I can totally see that.
[1096.60 --> 1098.58]  Because otherwise, there is...
[1098.58 --> 1099.12]  Is this table backwards?
[1099.26 --> 1100.08]  Otherwise, there is...
[1100.08 --> 1100.54]  Yes, it is.
[1100.54 --> 1100.80]  Yes.
[1100.96 --> 1103.76]  So our knees are like right into the face.
[1103.80 --> 1104.78]  I don't fit under the table.
[1105.38 --> 1109.40]  Otherwise, there is a distinct possibility that you will eat the paper.
[1110.42 --> 1110.78]  Yeah.
[1111.58 --> 1112.58]  I have had this problem.
[1112.88 --> 1113.08]  Yeah.
[1113.18 --> 1114.60]  Not with ice cream cones, usually.
[1114.94 --> 1116.22]  That's a pretty big piece of paper.
[1116.78 --> 1121.14]  But on at least one occasion, I've picked up an apple.
[1122.14 --> 1124.92]  I've gone, if I don't remove that tag, I'm going to eat it.
[1125.12 --> 1126.52]  And then you don't remove it, and then you eat it.
[1126.54 --> 1129.50]  And then I'm like, oh, I should take the tag off that...
[1129.50 --> 1129.68]  Oh.
[1129.68 --> 1129.78]  Oh.
[1131.54 --> 1135.12]  Because, okay, let's talk apple eating strategies for a minute here.
[1135.18 --> 1135.30]  Okay.
[1135.86 --> 1136.88]  Apple eating strategies.
[1136.96 --> 1137.68]  How do you eat your apples?
[1137.68 --> 1143.72]  I peel the thing off first every single time, no question, before I even start.
[1144.00 --> 1145.04]  I wash it.
[1145.26 --> 1145.44]  Yeah.
[1145.54 --> 1147.62]  And then I basically use my bottom teeth.
[1148.04 --> 1148.32]  I like...
[1148.32 --> 1149.64]  You're a bottom toother.
[1149.86 --> 1150.42]  I'm a bottom toother.
[1150.76 --> 1151.94]  You're a bottom toother.
[1152.36 --> 1153.64]  You know what is...
[1153.64 --> 1157.70]  You know what's funny about that is I think it probably has...
[1157.70 --> 1159.56]  Did you ever get like a dental correction?
[1160.52 --> 1162.68]  Like braces or anything like that?
[1162.72 --> 1162.90]  Okay.
[1163.24 --> 1163.88]  So what did they correct?
[1163.88 --> 1166.04]  I still have a bar behind my...
[1166.04 --> 1166.38]  You do?
[1166.58 --> 1167.60]  Behind my lower teeth.
[1167.68 --> 1169.40]  I've never noticed that when we've...
[1169.40 --> 1169.64]  Sorry.
[1171.42 --> 1172.56]  What were you saying?
[1173.56 --> 1175.20]  So what did they correct for you?
[1175.58 --> 1176.50]  Just tooth straightening?
[1176.52 --> 1177.32]  Just alignment, yeah.
[1177.38 --> 1177.76]  Just alignment.
[1177.90 --> 1178.04]  Okay.
[1178.52 --> 1179.22]  So I had...
[1179.22 --> 1180.46]  And bite a little bit, but not much.
[1180.46 --> 1181.12]  Under or over?
[1181.66 --> 1182.34]  I don't remember.
[1182.42 --> 1182.62]  Okay.
[1182.72 --> 1183.96]  And it wasn't very much at all.
[1184.02 --> 1184.60]  So I had a severe...
[1184.60 --> 1185.78]  They weren't even sure if they had to do it.
[1185.80 --> 1187.32]  I had like a ball and overbite.
[1187.48 --> 1188.66]  I was like horse kid.
[1189.06 --> 1189.26]  Oh.
[1189.26 --> 1190.20]  Like it's amazing.
[1190.20 --> 1193.72]  Like when I had like this mullet and I had like these...
[1193.72 --> 1195.80]  I have kind of big front teeth in the first place.
[1196.30 --> 1201.78]  And you know when they're like a good, you know, half a centimeter ahead of the bottom ones,
[1201.98 --> 1202.98]  it's like...
[1202.98 --> 1204.32]  Smile like that.
[1204.42 --> 1205.42]  Man, I was that kid.
[1205.42 --> 1209.60]  So I was always...
[1209.60 --> 1212.02]  Like I would do things like open pop cans with my front teeth.
[1212.18 --> 1212.54]  Like...
[1212.54 --> 1213.90]  Like...
[1213.90 --> 1214.24]  Oh yeah.
[1214.50 --> 1215.18]  That was me.
[1215.82 --> 1217.40]  Like they were way out there.
[1217.92 --> 1221.18]  So I am definitely a top teeth eater.
[1221.86 --> 1223.32]  But here's the next thing.
[1223.80 --> 1225.28]  Big bites or small bites?
[1226.44 --> 1226.84]  Big.
[1227.34 --> 1227.64]  Okay.
[1228.14 --> 1229.36]  So for me...
[1229.36 --> 1231.86]  Like annoyingly, uncomfortably big bites.
[1232.04 --> 1232.44]  Yes.
[1232.66 --> 1232.92]  Okay.
[1232.92 --> 1234.06]  Then we're...
[1234.06 --> 1235.58]  Different teeth, same strategy.
[1235.72 --> 1237.24]  Because I'm all about...
[1237.24 --> 1238.60]  You got to get it kind of low.
[1238.92 --> 1243.78]  And then I'm going for as close to a perpendicular entry for the teeth as possible.
[1243.90 --> 1243.92]  Yep.
[1243.92 --> 1244.02]  Yep.
[1244.20 --> 1247.38]  So you can pry basically a third of the apple away.
[1247.72 --> 1247.92]  Yeah.
[1248.30 --> 1250.16]  I just do that with my lower teeth.
[1250.22 --> 1252.66]  It is all about the first two bites of the apple.
[1252.98 --> 1254.52]  After that, everything goes downhill.
[1254.78 --> 1255.04]  Yep.
[1256.54 --> 1258.44]  Because I don't like mushy apple.
[1259.18 --> 1259.66]  Yep.
[1260.14 --> 1261.66]  Like I'm actually one of those people.
[1261.66 --> 1262.82]  I don't chew my food right.
[1263.46 --> 1267.28]  Like you know how you're supposed to chew food like 20 times or 30 times or whatever
[1267.28 --> 1268.22]  before you swallow it?
[1269.48 --> 1269.92]  Okay.
[1269.98 --> 1271.20]  I don't chew my food right.
[1272.20 --> 1273.96]  If that's the case, I don't...
[1273.96 --> 1274.18]  Right.
[1274.38 --> 1277.06]  Because for me, eating is like...
[1277.06 --> 1280.88]  It's like 60% flavor, 40% texture experience.
[1281.00 --> 1281.28]  Oh, yeah.
[1281.28 --> 1284.16]  And the texture of eating food.
[1284.76 --> 1288.32]  It's like, would I eat it if someone else chewed it up and put it on the plate?
[1288.60 --> 1289.98]  Do I want that in my mouth?
[1290.36 --> 1290.62]  No.
[1290.62 --> 1290.92]  No.
[1291.18 --> 1291.74]  And it's like...
[1291.74 --> 1292.88]  And it's not just about germs.
[1293.20 --> 1295.24]  Like it's like, you know, I'll kiss my wife.
[1295.28 --> 1299.92]  It's not like I have a problem with mouth to mouth contact or saliva exchange.
[1299.92 --> 1300.48]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1300.66 --> 1304.50]  But like if she chewed up food and put it on a plate, I'm not going to eat that shit.
[1304.50 --> 1305.78]  Have you ever done like a gum swap?
[1306.64 --> 1307.16]  Oh, yeah.
[1307.42 --> 1307.62]  Yeah.
[1307.72 --> 1308.18]  Who cares?
[1308.34 --> 1308.82]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1308.82 --> 1308.92]  Yeah.
[1310.04 --> 1312.32]  Because that doesn't ruin the texture of the gum.
[1312.44 --> 1312.64]  No.
[1313.06 --> 1313.38]  See?
[1313.38 --> 1314.72]  That's actually why I asked that.
[1315.20 --> 1319.58]  Because it reinforces your not worrying about the germs thing, but caring about the texture
[1319.58 --> 1319.80]  thing.
[1319.82 --> 1320.16]  Okay.
[1321.02 --> 1322.42]  Toothbrush share or no?
[1325.46 --> 1327.98]  I would never do it, but I don't actually care.
[1328.60 --> 1330.00]  You would never do it?
[1330.12 --> 1330.34]  No.
[1330.50 --> 1331.06]  Would you...
[1331.06 --> 1331.34]  Okay.
[1332.80 --> 1336.06]  Because I would always assume that the other person wouldn't want that to happen.
[1336.06 --> 1336.30]  Okay.
[1336.32 --> 1338.70]  There's kind of two ways you can go with this, though.
[1339.12 --> 1343.14]  So you would never borrow someone's, but would you let someone borrow yours?
[1343.78 --> 1344.40]  Depends who.
[1344.76 --> 1347.34]  Well, we're assuming this is a significant other.
[1347.92 --> 1350.80]  If it's a significant other, then yes, I would.
[1350.92 --> 1351.32]  What about me?
[1351.32 --> 1357.34]  But then she brushes her teeth like six times a day.
[1359.76 --> 1360.82]  Is that like a tick?
[1361.12 --> 1364.32]  Breakfast, dinner, and after every time she eats anything.
[1364.68 --> 1366.96]  She keeps the toothbrush and toothpaste in her purse.
[1367.32 --> 1367.78]  Really?
[1368.02 --> 1368.24]  Yeah.
[1368.38 --> 1369.06]  That's fascinating.
[1369.06 --> 1371.40]  So like it would probably clean the toothbrush.
[1373.38 --> 1375.98]  Okay.
[1376.06 --> 1379.30]  They've been through this on Friends, so we don't have to rehash this.
[1379.82 --> 1383.98]  But just because you're the cleanest thing in the house doesn't mean the towel gets cleaner
[1383.98 --> 1385.32]  when you wipe yourself with it.
[1385.76 --> 1386.48]  That's true.
[1387.18 --> 1387.58]  Um.
[1389.78 --> 1390.58]  I don't know.
[1390.72 --> 1391.16]  I don't know.
[1391.26 --> 1393.08]  I'm not that worried about it because I...
[1393.08 --> 1393.82]  I don't know.
[1393.96 --> 1396.96]  I clean it up before and after every time I use it.
[1397.06 --> 1397.34]  Right.
[1397.48 --> 1397.78]  Okay.
[1397.78 --> 1398.78]  So like...
[1398.78 --> 1401.62]  So here's the reason that I wouldn't use my wife's.
[1401.62 --> 1402.88]  I'll let my wife use mine.
[1403.06 --> 1403.34]  Okay.
[1403.46 --> 1405.68]  As long as I get to it after she's done.
[1405.96 --> 1406.24]  Okay.
[1406.28 --> 1409.62]  Because she doesn't hang it out to dry.
[1410.08 --> 1410.82]  I dry mine too.
[1411.18 --> 1414.20]  She lets it sit in the puddle.
[1414.44 --> 1415.34]  Mine has a stand.
[1416.48 --> 1417.58]  So I put it on the stand.
[1417.66 --> 1418.64]  I'm way too cheap for that.
[1418.64 --> 1421.02]  Well, I got mine for free.
[1421.16 --> 1421.34]  Okay.
[1421.68 --> 1422.74]  Did I have it told you this story?
[1423.76 --> 1425.36]  I got an electric toothbrush and refill...
[1425.36 --> 1428.84]  Why would I know the story of your free toothbrush holder?
[1429.04 --> 1429.74]  No, because...
[1429.74 --> 1430.88]  Well, it wasn't a toothbrush holder.
[1430.96 --> 1432.26]  It has a charging stand.
[1432.76 --> 1434.18]  It has an induction charging stand.
[1434.20 --> 1434.60]  Oh, that's cool.
[1434.92 --> 1439.98]  Because I went to the dentist and he was doing work or whatever and he was supposed to freeze
[1439.98 --> 1445.02]  part of my mouth but he like pushed the injection thing after he pulled it out and it like
[1445.02 --> 1448.82]  froze a whole bunch of my face unnecessarily and it was like...
[1448.82 --> 1450.58]  Was this when you were getting your wisdom teeth out?
[1451.12 --> 1452.60]  It was the start of that.
[1453.06 --> 1457.74]  So he like super screwed up and was like, please don't sue me.
[1457.98 --> 1459.74]  Here's a free really expensive toothbrush.
[1460.30 --> 1461.46]  And I was like, okay.
[1464.24 --> 1469.46]  So I have this like super ball and electric toothbrush that I paid $0 for and then for
[1469.46 --> 1471.46]  the whole rest of the day my face was just like...
[1471.46 --> 1472.74]  Awesome.
[1473.04 --> 1474.52]  Oh, well, totally worth it in my opinion.
[1474.52 --> 1476.20]  So yeah, it has the stand thing.
[1476.80 --> 1479.10]  So I cleaned it off and then put it on the stand every time.
[1479.60 --> 1479.88]  Okay.
[1479.92 --> 1481.32]  So I think it's actually relatively clean.
[1481.52 --> 1483.62]  Like even when I throw them away, they look super clean.
[1483.78 --> 1484.84]  Just the bristles are all messed up.
[1484.86 --> 1488.50]  I just used my toothpaste tube and I rested on it.
[1488.64 --> 1488.84]  Yeah, yeah.
[1488.84 --> 1489.70]  I used to do that.
[1489.76 --> 1490.52]  I'd lay it on that.
[1490.68 --> 1496.38]  I discovered a pro brushing tip though and I didn't like look this up but I couldn't figure
[1496.38 --> 1496.74]  this out.
[1496.78 --> 1500.80]  I was like, the first time I brushed my teeth with a new toothbrush because you're supposed
[1500.80 --> 1502.00]  to use Extra Soft, right?
[1502.00 --> 1504.90]  Like everyone universally is supposed to use Extra Soft.
[1505.24 --> 1509.72]  And I actually have an issue with my gums receding which is apparently pretty common in people
[1509.72 --> 1510.50]  who have had braces.
[1511.30 --> 1514.56]  And I just brushed too hard for a long, long time.
[1514.78 --> 1517.50]  And awesome pro tip for you guys.
[1517.50 --> 1524.42]  I was like, every time I get an Extra Soft toothbrush within a week, it's like, it feels really hard
[1524.42 --> 1525.48]  and really stiff.
[1525.48 --> 1538.30]  So now, my morning routine and my nighttime routine is I run water on the toothbrush first and then let it sit for two to five minutes while I do everything
[1538.30 --> 1538.68]  else.
[1539.10 --> 1540.58]  And the bristles are soft.
[1540.76 --> 1541.34]  Yeah, no, I do.
[1541.46 --> 1542.12]  I didn't know that.
[1542.30 --> 1542.44]  Yeah.
[1542.58 --> 1543.54]  Do people know this?
[1543.54 --> 1544.12]  I have like...
[1544.12 --> 1544.76]  Strupple time!
[1544.96 --> 1548.70]  I have relatively extensive toothbrush cleaning before and after.
[1549.14 --> 1550.14]  After, I like scrub it.
[1550.14 --> 1552.58]  Well, no, I'll clean it right away, but then I would use it right away.
[1553.30 --> 1553.66]  Oh.
[1553.96 --> 1555.62]  So I wouldn't let it soak for a bit.
[1555.68 --> 1556.52]  Yeah, I don't let it soak.
[1557.36 --> 1558.76]  It makes it way softer.
[1559.06 --> 1559.30]  Oh.
[1559.60 --> 1559.96]  Yeah.
[1560.20 --> 1560.70]  I didn't know that was a good one.
[1560.70 --> 1564.12]  So do you pre-soak your toothbrush?
[1565.70 --> 1568.48]  So yes, I knew about this.
[1568.72 --> 1569.62]  No, I didn't.
[1571.58 --> 1572.06]  Turnip.
[1572.78 --> 1573.52]  All right.
[1573.80 --> 1574.50]  Blah, blah, blah.
[1576.50 --> 1579.34]  I've got some people complaining this is the worst WAN show ever.
[1579.66 --> 1582.58]  This is some of our best viewership on the WAN show ever.
[1582.70 --> 1587.30]  We have 7,700 people watching and we are half an hour into the show.
[1587.52 --> 1588.98]  And haven't talked about anything.
[1588.98 --> 1590.80]  That is an all-time high.
[1591.10 --> 1593.60]  Like by a significant margin.
[1596.54 --> 1599.04]  Why don't we even bother talking about tech at all?
[1599.34 --> 1601.72]  We should just completely rebrand the WAN show.
[1602.36 --> 1603.80]  The weekly...
[1603.80 --> 1606.42]  The weekly lack of analysis and news show.
[1606.58 --> 1609.40]  Yeah, the WLAN show.
[1609.40 --> 1609.74]  The WLAN show.
[1609.74 --> 1610.78]  The WLAN show!
[1611.08 --> 1611.32]  Yeah!
[1613.64 --> 1615.36]  And like it's unreliable.
[1616.82 --> 1618.50]  Because it's late all the time.
[1618.50 --> 1619.80]  Because it's wireless!
[1620.24 --> 1620.40]  Yeah!
[1623.56 --> 1624.98]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[1626.36 --> 1628.10]  Apparently I'm on the main page of Twitch.
[1628.80 --> 1632.08]  So apparently it's just because nothing is going on in esports right now.
[1632.18 --> 1633.34]  So there you go.
[1633.46 --> 1635.86]  It has nothing to do with us hosting a good show.
[1636.24 --> 1637.80]  Nothing to do with that at all.
[1638.06 --> 1641.44]  We often stream when there's like nothing specifically going on.
[1641.62 --> 1641.98]  Yeah.
[1642.62 --> 1642.86]  Take that.
[1642.86 --> 1644.38]  Summer Games Done Quick is going on.
[1644.44 --> 1645.62]  What are you guys even talking about?
[1646.24 --> 1649.40]  Oh, I don't know how to screen share with you guys easily here.
[1649.48 --> 1650.16]  Hold on a second.
[1651.32 --> 1652.60]  Games Done Quick is awesome.
[1653.16 --> 1654.00]  Yeah, but...
[1654.00 --> 1654.94]  Okay.
[1655.10 --> 1657.88]  Yeah, I had that set up a specific way.
[1658.28 --> 1658.58]  You know what?
[1658.62 --> 1659.32]  Give me a sec.
[1659.36 --> 1662.70]  I'm going to have to figure out how to screen share this with you guys.
[1662.92 --> 1663.50]  Scene 7.
[1663.64 --> 1663.88]  Oh.
[1664.34 --> 1664.66]  Okay.
[1664.66 --> 1669.56]  Yeah, there's 132,000 people watching Super Mario Bros. 3.
[1670.74 --> 1671.88]  132,000 people?
[1672.00 --> 1673.26]  It's Summer Games Done Quick.
[1673.42 --> 1674.88]  There is important stuff going on.
[1675.04 --> 1675.34]  Yeah!
[1675.50 --> 1675.72]  Yeah!
[1675.80 --> 1676.88]  Take that, you guys.
[1677.54 --> 1679.22]  So add screen capture.
[1680.22 --> 1682.40]  And let's just grab this browser window.
[1682.56 --> 1683.06]  Boom!
[1683.40 --> 1683.56]  Ha!
[1683.72 --> 1684.90]  I can sit over top of Luke.
[1684.94 --> 1685.62]  I hate that guy.
[1685.74 --> 1686.16]  Hey!
[1686.28 --> 1686.56]  Hey!
[1687.22 --> 1687.78]  Take that.
[1687.84 --> 1688.46]  All right.
[1688.84 --> 1690.06]  That's the lightest show.
[1690.46 --> 1691.64]  Do you pre-soak your toothbrush?
[1691.90 --> 1692.16]  No!
[1692.16 --> 1703.20]  47% of you either do not pre-soak your toothbrush or your brushing habits involve a tuber for some reason.
[1704.06 --> 1709.66]  Only 24% of you knew about this pro tip, so I'm feeling pretty good about that little life hack right there.
[1709.74 --> 1712.90]  That's a pretty high percentage considering I've never seen someone do that ever.
[1713.08 --> 1713.46]  Okay.
[1713.68 --> 1717.54]  So we have got a lot of people talking about the fire pole.
[1718.40 --> 1718.72]  Do we...
[1718.72 --> 1719.06]  Should we...
[1719.06 --> 1721.28]  Is there anything to address at this point?
[1721.28 --> 1726.70]  Other than to beg you to please stop spamming my social media...
[1726.70 --> 1726.94]  Please stop?
[1727.20 --> 1728.72]  With hashtag fire pole.
[1728.74 --> 1730.22]  More like please continue.
[1730.70 --> 1732.62]  Depending on who you ask.
[1733.02 --> 1737.50]  My girlfriend's Instagram is literally just hashtag fire pole.
[1739.00 --> 1742.52]  Any photo that she posts, she'll be like, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1742.58 --> 1744.52]  This random thing that has nothing to do with computers.
[1744.86 --> 1745.68]  Hashtag fire pole.
[1746.04 --> 1746.78]  The whole thing.
[1746.78 --> 1747.32]  Wow.
[1748.16 --> 1749.72]  I feel kind of bad.
[1750.28 --> 1750.76]  You should.
[1750.76 --> 1752.54]  Her friends don't even post on it anymore.
[1752.74 --> 1756.34]  Because it's been just completely taken over by viewers.
[1756.72 --> 1760.26]  I mean, is that a kind of like cyber attack?
[1760.50 --> 1761.16]  A little bit.
[1761.42 --> 1762.44]  Hashtag spamming?
[1762.44 --> 1765.06]  She can't have like her own Instagram anymore.
[1765.44 --> 1768.48]  Because it's been completely taken over by viewers.
[1768.90 --> 1769.66]  It's kind of like...
[1769.66 --> 1771.88]  It's kind of like mafia wives, you know?
[1772.76 --> 1775.38]  Like online personality wives.
[1775.50 --> 1776.44]  They just...
[1776.44 --> 1777.90]  You know, they just can't...
[1777.90 --> 1779.94]  They just can't live normal lives anymore.
[1780.14 --> 1780.30]  Yeah.
[1780.48 --> 1781.34]  That's all there is to it.
[1781.40 --> 1782.96]  Their social media is just doomed.
[1783.14 --> 1783.38]  Yeah.
[1783.62 --> 1784.30]  From now on.
[1786.04 --> 1787.22]  How's the audio in here?
[1787.62 --> 1788.22]  I have no idea.
[1788.22 --> 1789.26]  Have you listened to the show at all?
[1789.34 --> 1789.76]  I have not.
[1789.76 --> 1790.58]  You don't have headphones on.
[1790.58 --> 1791.64]  I haven't seen anyone complaining.
[1791.88 --> 1792.10]  Yeah.
[1792.22 --> 1793.12]  I haven't seen anyone complaining.
[1793.38 --> 1793.88]  And you know what?
[1793.90 --> 1796.40]  I think the bot is just going on a banning spree right now.
[1796.42 --> 1799.36]  This should be pretty much about as bad as it gets.
[1799.44 --> 1802.92]  We're in the library right now, which is not designed for audio at all.
[1802.92 --> 1803.08]  No.
[1803.40 --> 1805.46]  And also has no furniture in it yet.
[1805.60 --> 1806.92]  And has like holes in the ceiling.
[1807.52 --> 1807.72]  Yeah.
[1807.76 --> 1811.54]  When we're out in the studio, it should be significantly better than this.
[1811.60 --> 1813.88]  I am so excited about this place.
[1813.90 --> 1814.02]  Oh my God.
[1814.02 --> 1816.54]  The bot is banning so many people.
[1816.92 --> 1819.10]  Guys, I would be careful about the spam.
[1819.10 --> 1820.76]  Guys, these are perma-bans.
[1820.90 --> 1822.10]  The bot will wreck you.
[1822.26 --> 1822.58]  Yeah.
[1823.98 --> 1826.18]  Well, the bot wasn't up last week, so.
[1826.26 --> 1826.68]  That's true.
[1826.72 --> 1827.78]  The bot is back.
[1828.14 --> 1828.58]  Bam!
[1828.78 --> 1830.28]  I was wrecking people last week.
[1830.30 --> 1831.08]  Ah, yes.
[1831.16 --> 1832.40]  The manual wreckage.
[1832.48 --> 1834.28]  I banned like 20, 25 people.
[1835.60 --> 1837.74]  Because people were like, oh, the bot's not up.
[1837.76 --> 1838.76]  And then posting stuff.
[1838.84 --> 1839.72]  And I was like, nope.
[1840.98 --> 1841.34]  Goodbye.
[1841.34 --> 1841.58]  Bye.
[1844.46 --> 1844.78]  Oh.
[1846.28 --> 1847.84]  So, internet speed.
[1848.46 --> 1849.42]  Speed test.
[1849.42 --> 1849.52]  Mm-hmm.
[1851.02 --> 1853.40]  New office update, you guys.
[1853.40 --> 1857.70]  So, I was here until almost midnight the other night.
[1857.90 --> 1860.86]  I think it was like 10, 30, 11, something like that.
[1861.42 --> 1864.46]  And it was for a very good reason.
[1865.56 --> 1867.14]  Check this out.
[1867.64 --> 1870.64]  So, as usual, hold on.
[1870.70 --> 1872.00]  Group by date.
[1872.22 --> 1874.48]  Sorry, I just set up Windows 8 on my laptop.
[1874.68 --> 1877.34]  So, I'm like super not set up properly yet.
[1877.70 --> 1878.66]  You set up Windows 8.
[1878.66 --> 1880.10]  I really like it so far.
[1880.76 --> 1881.74]  You mean 10.
[1881.90 --> 1882.12]  10.
[1882.26 --> 1882.84]  Did I say 8?
[1882.94 --> 1883.16]  Yes.
[1883.24 --> 1884.04]  Oh, no, no, no.
[1884.12 --> 1885.16]  I'm running Windows 10 now.
[1885.16 --> 1888.40]  I was going to be like, you set up Windows 8 when everyone else got Windows 10.
[1888.40 --> 1889.80]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1889.88 --> 1890.08]  Sorry.
[1891.06 --> 1892.34]  So, I hold on.
[1892.62 --> 1893.70]  Where is it?
[1894.22 --> 1895.28]  Yeah, that's fine.
[1895.38 --> 1896.12]  I'm not worried about that.
[1896.64 --> 1897.36]  You weren't allowed.
[1897.86 --> 1898.54]  No, it's okay.
[1898.66 --> 1899.52]  I actually talked to them.
[1900.06 --> 1901.02]  I talked to them about it.
[1901.02 --> 1901.56]  I cleared it with them.
[1901.74 --> 1901.98]  Cool.
[1902.14 --> 1903.10]  So, oh.
[1903.86 --> 1905.74]  What the crap?
[1906.74 --> 1908.30]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[1908.88 --> 1912.80]  I actually haven't used the new version of XSplit that extensively.
[1913.22 --> 1914.00]  It's pretty sweet.
[1914.00 --> 1919.60]  So, I guess what I have to do is I have to grab this side of the screen somewhat manually
[1919.60 --> 1920.16]  now, though.
[1920.70 --> 1921.06]  Okay.
[1921.16 --> 1921.68]  So, there you go.
[1921.72 --> 1922.92]  I'm replacing Luke again.
[1923.56 --> 1923.96]  Bye.
[1924.18 --> 1927.60]  That, my friends, is why I was here late.
[1927.60 --> 1938.84]  So, apparently, our ping to the nearest hub is two milliseconds.
[1939.56 --> 1942.02]  We are extremely close to it.
[1942.84 --> 1948.96]  He was tunneled in doing some tests, and he was like, whoa, what's your address again?
[1949.82 --> 1950.84]  And I was like, blah, blah, blah.
[1950.84 --> 1955.38]  He's like, yeah, you are like blocks from it.
[1956.42 --> 1958.46]  Two millisecond ping to the node.
[1958.98 --> 1963.90]  And so, this test here was actually to a server in, like, Kelowna or something.
[1963.90 --> 1964.10]  Yeah.
[1964.42 --> 1967.28]  So, it's, I don't even know if it's a great server.
[1967.30 --> 1968.78]  That Kelowna server is not going to be great.
[1968.86 --> 1969.10]  Yeah.
[1969.36 --> 1972.72]  Like, our best server to test to is actually in Seattle.
[1972.86 --> 1975.52]  So, Google was six milliseconds.
[1975.84 --> 1976.30]  There you go.
[1976.38 --> 1976.92]  From here.
[1977.04 --> 1977.28]  Yeah.
[1977.78 --> 1979.30]  Freaking sick.
[1979.30 --> 1987.26]  So, the 200 up, 200 down is actually not the most important aspect of our speed test.
[1987.78 --> 1992.82]  What's actually far more important for a speed test is the latency.
[1993.18 --> 2002.30]  Because when you're browsing the web, you have to wait for your side and the other side to acknowledge each other first.
[2003.10 --> 2005.04]  Before any data is transferred at all.
[2005.04 --> 2012.74]  So, when you're doing something like downloading a Steam game, yeah, that bandwidth number, that throughput number, that's key.
[2013.20 --> 2013.30]  Yeah.
[2013.30 --> 2020.84]  But when you're doing something like browsing social media, you know, refreshing your Facebook page, little transactional stuff like that.
[2021.12 --> 2023.78]  There's a guy in the Twitch chat with the handle LinusLateTips.
[2023.96 --> 2024.84]  LinusLateTips.
[2025.00 --> 2025.16]  Yeah.
[2025.36 --> 2025.60]  Sorry.
[2025.78 --> 2026.46]  That's just awesome.
[2026.68 --> 2026.88]  Keep going.
[2026.88 --> 2034.12]  So, when you're doing little transactional things, that latency makes way more of a difference.
[2034.26 --> 2034.40]  Yeah.
[2034.52 --> 2036.36]  So, that low-leg connection, man.
[2036.36 --> 2038.78]  I was just explaining this whole thing to someone like yesterday.
[2039.42 --> 2040.56]  So, that's really funny.
[2041.56 --> 2043.60]  Because I was talking about my new internet that I'm getting.
[2043.80 --> 2044.08]  Right.
[2044.16 --> 2047.78]  That should also let me stream better from home because I was not able to do that.
[2047.78 --> 2049.36]  You're moving to Telus Fiber, aren't you?
[2049.36 --> 2049.64]  Yeah.
[2050.12 --> 2053.76]  And my network connection will be like doubling.
[2054.78 --> 2055.22]  Nice.
[2055.44 --> 2057.26]  So, I'll be getting like twice as fast.
[2057.26 --> 2059.76]  They have a 200 down service now, don't they?
[2060.14 --> 2060.78]  No, 100.
[2061.10 --> 2062.10]  But you were on 50 down.
[2062.12 --> 2062.80]  I was on 50.
[2062.84 --> 2063.20]  Nice.
[2063.80 --> 2067.00]  And so, my upload should be better for those Twitch streams.
[2067.72 --> 2069.98]  And it should just be better overall.
[2070.20 --> 2070.40]  Nice.
[2070.40 --> 2071.60]  Hopefully, I'll be able to actually stream from there.
[2071.68 --> 2073.64]  But honestly, I'll probably mainly be streaming from here.
[2076.18 --> 2076.88]  Oh, man.
[2076.88 --> 2077.28]  I'm amazed at that.
[2077.54 --> 2078.06]  All right.
[2078.64 --> 2079.08]  Yeah.
[2079.08 --> 2080.96]  I'm really excited about the new network connection.
[2081.48 --> 2082.24]  You guys, seriously.
[2082.24 --> 2083.58]  It's sick.
[2084.02 --> 2089.72]  So, we're on Wi-Fi on some like horrible ancient D-Link router right now.
[2089.72 --> 2091.30]  I was like, what the heck?
[2091.38 --> 2094.24]  Because all the access points are stuck in the roof.
[2095.82 --> 2102.40]  So, but we were uploading videos to YouTube and it's just like, wow.
[2102.66 --> 2104.20]  Like, I uploaded a pretty short one.
[2104.24 --> 2105.46]  It was only a 30 second clip.
[2105.46 --> 2107.16]  But it's 4K and like stuff.
[2107.34 --> 2108.36]  Like, it's...
[2108.36 --> 2109.08]  A fair amount of data.
[2109.08 --> 2109.16]  Yeah.
[2109.16 --> 2110.44]  It's still a fair amount of data.
[2110.44 --> 2110.56]  Yeah.
[2110.56 --> 2112.64]  And I was like, hey guys, you've got to come see this.
[2112.70 --> 2113.62]  The upload's so fast.
[2113.98 --> 2117.82]  And Ed and Taryn are like walking over and they get to me.
[2117.92 --> 2119.24]  They're only like 20 paces away.
[2119.28 --> 2120.00]  And I'm like, sorry, it's done.
[2120.00 --> 2121.00]  That's awesome.
[2121.00 --> 2122.72]  That's awesome.
[2122.72 --> 2124.08]  The internet connection's too fast.
[2124.08 --> 2125.38]  It's actually faster than you.
[2126.38 --> 2128.84]  Oh, I should put my server here.
[2136.06 --> 2136.66]  Yeah.
[2137.32 --> 2138.40]  I should do that.
[2139.02 --> 2139.76]  What server?
[2140.04 --> 2140.38]  Nothing.
[2140.82 --> 2141.16]  No.
[2143.20 --> 2144.52]  Absolutely not.
[2144.52 --> 2145.88]  I'll just hide it.
[2147.04 --> 2147.44]  No.
[2147.60 --> 2148.64]  It's a really big office.
[2149.14 --> 2149.54]  No.
[2149.92 --> 2151.90]  It's a really big office that like...
[2151.90 --> 2153.30]  I could probably put it in the roof panels.
[2153.40 --> 2153.74]  No.
[2155.92 --> 2156.36]  No.
[2156.36 --> 2156.48]  No.
[2156.48 --> 2163.68]  Oh, what else is there to say?
[2164.08 --> 2167.76]  A lot of people have noticed that my wife has been helping us with the moving blog.
[2167.98 --> 2168.50]  You know what?
[2168.56 --> 2171.14]  This is actually something I've been needing to address for a little while.
[2171.44 --> 2176.00]  I had said in some of the new office updates that I've been trying to get my wife to come
[2176.00 --> 2176.62]  work for us.
[2177.04 --> 2180.94]  And I saw some people commenting about how she would only work for us because she's the
[2180.94 --> 2181.70]  boss's wife.
[2181.70 --> 2184.80]  And, you know, she hasn't helped with Linus Media Group or whatever else.
[2184.80 --> 2188.16]  You guys, my wife co-runs this company with me.
[2188.40 --> 2193.18]  Just because she's not in front of the camera and just because she also has a full-time job
[2193.18 --> 2199.62]  and also had two babies in the last three years, she's like had a lot of crap on her
[2199.62 --> 2199.84]  plate.
[2200.26 --> 2202.26]  She does all of our bookkeeping.
[2202.62 --> 2202.72]  Yeah.
[2202.82 --> 2205.06]  She does a lot of our organizational stuff.
[2205.24 --> 2206.66]  She takes care of payroll.
[2207.24 --> 2210.66]  She coordinated the new office.
[2210.66 --> 2215.00]  I basically, it was like her being like, uh, what do you want?
[2215.44 --> 2217.58]  And me being like, I don't know, this, this, this, and this.
[2217.68 --> 2220.06]  And then everything else was done by her.
[2220.14 --> 2227.56]  She is 100% a Linus Media Group, like OG Linus Media Group.
[2227.56 --> 2232.60]  So it would, there would be nothing ceremonial about her having an office and a title.
[2232.84 --> 2233.92]  Someone asked if she cooks.
[2234.10 --> 2238.56]  And I know that was probably a sexist comment, but I have to say very well.
[2238.72 --> 2238.96]  Yep.
[2240.14 --> 2240.86]  Very well.
[2241.04 --> 2241.96]  I love my life cooking.
[2241.96 --> 2243.32]  But I really like cooking and she's really good.
[2243.50 --> 2243.72]  Yep.
[2244.40 --> 2245.52]  So there you go.
[2245.64 --> 2245.76]  Yeah.
[2245.82 --> 2250.88]  There would be, there would be nothing not earned about it if she got an office here.
[2251.04 --> 2254.24]  I, I straight up, no one in the company would object to that.
[2254.24 --> 2255.96]  So there you go.
[2256.20 --> 2257.96]  Isn't that, she, she has one.
[2258.34 --> 2258.62]  Yeah.
[2258.62 --> 2259.56]  It's going to sit empty.
[2259.90 --> 2261.16]  And she's not even an employee.
[2261.38 --> 2262.78]  Until she decides to work here.
[2262.80 --> 2265.76]  I think, I think that probably gets the point across.
[2265.76 --> 2267.92]  The problem is that she works at Costco.
[2268.40 --> 2268.60]  Yeah.
[2268.68 --> 2271.52]  So she's got like great benefits.
[2271.68 --> 2272.26]  Better than ours.
[2272.40 --> 2273.24]  Better than ours.
[2273.32 --> 2277.40]  She's got like sick RRSP this and that.
[2277.48 --> 2280.98]  She's got like, she's got more vacation days a year than I do.
[2280.98 --> 2284.54]  She, like, she's, she's got a good salary.
[2284.82 --> 2285.96]  So all that stuff.
[2286.06 --> 2290.94]  So it's like, I haven't been a big enough company yet to even try to entice her.
[2291.16 --> 2292.84]  But I figured, come on man, office?
[2293.02 --> 2293.62]  We're getting there.
[2293.74 --> 2295.36]  And she's like, is there a window?
[2295.60 --> 2298.22]  And I'm like, well, you helped to design the office.
[2298.32 --> 2299.68]  Only my office has a window.
[2301.26 --> 2303.00]  You know, so I'm, I'm working it.
[2303.04 --> 2304.44]  I'm working the angles, you know?
[2304.52 --> 2305.06]  This guy.
[2305.16 --> 2306.02]  I'm working the angles.
[2306.02 --> 2309.34]  I love how you have the least accessible office in the whole freaking place.
[2310.12 --> 2311.32]  Except for maybe Nick.
[2311.56 --> 2314.48]  But then he's not even going to use it because he wants to be more accessible.
[2315.24 --> 2316.58]  Oh, is he not planning to use it?
[2316.64 --> 2317.40]  Hasn't he told you about that?
[2317.40 --> 2318.16]  I haven't talked to him about it.
[2318.16 --> 2319.88]  He wants to use it as a call room.
[2320.78 --> 2322.38]  So anyone can use it as a call room.
[2322.56 --> 2326.26]  So all the guys will be on the floor and then people can go in there whenever they need to do calls.
[2326.26 --> 2327.12]  That makes sense.
[2327.24 --> 2330.82]  And then if, and that way if the main meeting room is taken up, then people can pop in there.
[2330.82 --> 2334.60]  And like only if we're desperate, if there's someone from the outside.
[2335.00 --> 2335.62]  You know what?
[2335.64 --> 2337.24]  That's actually a really crazy thing.
[2337.64 --> 2339.44]  We have a lot of partners.
[2339.76 --> 2344.06]  Like, you know, whether it's Intel or Monster Cat even.
[2344.26 --> 2349.02]  Like we use a lot of their music and, you know, Twitch or whatever.
[2349.16 --> 2350.86]  Like we've got so many partners.
[2352.32 --> 2356.08]  We have never invited, actually, yeah, I saw that.
[2356.14 --> 2357.00]  I'm going to talk about it in a minute.
[2357.00 --> 2362.42]  We've only ever, I think, had two vendors visit us at the office.
[2364.08 --> 2365.40]  Exforma was there.
[2365.42 --> 2365.94]  Exforma, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2366.02 --> 2367.60]  And EK Waterblocks came.
[2367.60 --> 2370.84]  Yeah, and Cooler Master.
[2371.34 --> 2372.36]  And Cooler Master.
[2373.08 --> 2377.00]  So because, like, there's only a few guys that...
[2377.64 --> 2379.04]  He's not a partner, but Lou.
[2379.64 --> 2380.48]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[2380.56 --> 2381.94]  Lou from Unbox Therapy has been there.
[2382.56 --> 2384.16]  But he's like a friend.
[2384.50 --> 2384.66]  Yeah.
[2384.66 --> 2388.04]  So anyway, like not many partners that we actually do like...
[2388.04 --> 2389.66]  Josh, but that wasn't at this office.
[2389.82 --> 2390.94]  Yeah, that was at the old one.
[2390.94 --> 2391.38]  That was at the garage.
[2391.62 --> 2396.38]  So that we do actual business, you know, monetary transactional business with.
[2396.58 --> 2400.86]  We don't invite people to our office because it was so horrible.
[2401.04 --> 2402.60]  It was honestly...
[2402.60 --> 2405.18]  Like we did interviews relatively recently.
[2405.96 --> 2408.70]  Yeah, that was for potential new hires.
[2408.76 --> 2411.14]  And that was like kind of embarrassing.
[2411.14 --> 2414.84]  The first thing I said when they walked in the door, guys, we're getting a new office, like, in a week.
[2416.68 --> 2417.84]  What else can I say?
[2417.96 --> 2418.14]  Yeah.
[2418.24 --> 2419.42]  Because it was just embarrassing.
[2419.84 --> 2425.74]  Whereas now, now that we'll have like a meeting room and like, you know, an office for people to walk through,
[2425.82 --> 2428.62]  I'm actually kind of excited to have people, you know, come and meet with us.
[2428.70 --> 2430.78]  I'm excited for this room and the benching room.
[2430.92 --> 2431.18]  Did I tell you...
[2431.18 --> 2432.30]  This is where I'll be all the time.
[2432.34 --> 2433.78]  YouTube said they want to come see it.
[2434.04 --> 2434.54]  That's cool.
[2434.72 --> 2434.98]  Yeah.
[2435.50 --> 2436.26]  That's really cool.
[2436.30 --> 2436.50]  Yeah.
[2436.72 --> 2438.14]  We actually, like, we finally have...
[2438.14 --> 2439.22]  Hey, we recognized us.
[2439.24 --> 2440.20]  We finally have...
[2440.20 --> 2440.38]  Yeah.
[2440.58 --> 2441.36]  No, totally.
[2441.56 --> 2445.86]  Well, I went down and I sat on that panel at the creator session.
[2446.40 --> 2453.22]  And then a couple of the people that I talked to there were just blown away that we have a studio.
[2453.58 --> 2455.62]  And they were like, yeah, can we come see it when it's done?
[2455.62 --> 2456.50]  I'm like, yeah, totally.
[2456.64 --> 2457.08]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2457.08 --> 2458.96]  I know Vessel is planning to come visit.
[2459.08 --> 2459.38]  Sick.
[2460.24 --> 2461.04]  That's really cool.
[2461.44 --> 2461.60]  Yeah.
[2461.74 --> 2465.60]  So, yeah, they're particularly stoked on it because...
[2465.60 --> 2468.82]  Well, the Vessel guys have been up here too, but they didn't come to the office.
[2468.88 --> 2469.22]  No.
[2469.84 --> 2470.20]  Exactly.
[2470.40 --> 2470.60]  Yeah.
[2470.66 --> 2472.00]  Because we didn't want them to come in.
[2472.24 --> 2472.28]  Yeah.
[2472.58 --> 2473.48]  Well, that's...
[2473.48 --> 2474.50]  Because, like, it's gross.
[2474.76 --> 2475.46]  Yeah, it was horrible.
[2475.94 --> 2477.50]  So, yeah, the thing...
[2477.50 --> 2481.84]  I think what Vessel's really interested in seeing is what they helped build because...
[2481.84 --> 2483.90]  And I've wanted to address this on the WAN show for a while.
[2484.38 --> 2488.26]  We did a crowdfunding campaign to help us with the cost of the new office.
[2488.26 --> 2492.80]  We raised something in the neighborhood of $30,000 to $35,000, something along that line.
[2493.22 --> 2494.16]  Huge help.
[2494.50 --> 2496.50]  Made a really, really big difference.
[2497.20 --> 2503.60]  But some of you watched or read, rather, the interview that I gave with Vessel, like
[2503.60 --> 2510.54]  the creator profile thing, where Vessel talked about how their funding helped us expand our
[2510.54 --> 2513.36]  building plans for our new office in a really big way.
[2513.36 --> 2517.38]  So, I want to just put it in the right sort of context here.
[2517.78 --> 2520.50]  The $35,000 helped us in an immense way.
[2521.00 --> 2527.22]  Anyone who knows anything about new office construction knows that that is not what this
[2527.22 --> 2528.18]  project cost.
[2528.80 --> 2530.08]  Not even close.
[2530.66 --> 2531.94]  So, there was a lot...
[2531.94 --> 2537.72]  So, some people were really upset about Vessel kind of taking the credit for that.
[2537.72 --> 2540.36]  And no, they shouldn't have taken all the credit.
[2540.36 --> 2541.52]  We had it updated.
[2542.06 --> 2542.10]  Yeah.
[2542.22 --> 2544.22]  And the article was actually updated.
[2544.38 --> 2546.86]  Because I realized that was a wording error.
[2547.22 --> 2547.42]  Yeah.
[2547.76 --> 2548.24]  That's not fair.
[2548.26 --> 2554.98]  But the deal that we made with Vessel has contributed a huge chunk of why we were able
[2554.98 --> 2556.26]  to build out the upstairs right away.
[2557.04 --> 2561.54]  And, I mean, the reason that was important is because we didn't want construction going
[2561.54 --> 2562.82]  on up there while we're trying to film.
[2563.06 --> 2563.90]  Especially now that...
[2563.90 --> 2566.56]  That would stop us from filming for a fairly considerably large amount of time.
[2566.56 --> 2570.46]  And then, like, even just the dust from that would actually be kind of a problem with,
[2570.58 --> 2571.48]  like, lenses and stuff.
[2572.16 --> 2575.62]  Can you believe how big the old office is now that it's empty?
[2575.86 --> 2576.18]  I don't know.
[2577.86 --> 2578.26]  Burkle.
[2578.50 --> 2578.76]  Yeah.
[2579.06 --> 2580.38]  Burkle was blown away.
[2580.74 --> 2583.40]  So, Burkle has only worked with us for, like, what?
[2583.46 --> 2583.88]  Six months?
[2584.02 --> 2584.60]  Something like that?
[2585.40 --> 2586.80]  I want to say six months.
[2587.24 --> 2587.64]  Probably.
[2587.80 --> 2587.92]  Sure.
[2588.66 --> 2591.50]  So, Burkle's only worked with us for about six months.
[2591.60 --> 2592.18]  No, it's a year.
[2592.40 --> 2592.90]  Is it a year?
[2592.90 --> 2593.56]  Shut up.
[2595.00 --> 2595.44]  No.
[2595.44 --> 2595.76]  No.
[2596.54 --> 2598.50]  No, he was at his old job a year ago.
[2598.58 --> 2599.94]  But he was close to quitting.
[2600.04 --> 2601.06]  I think it's been, like, eight.
[2601.40 --> 2601.78]  Okay.
[2601.92 --> 2602.34]  Well, okay.
[2602.44 --> 2602.68]  Okay.
[2603.24 --> 2605.54]  Oh, my life is just passing me by.
[2606.40 --> 2607.86]  So, we...
[2607.86 --> 2609.96]  Well, think about how long, like, Taryn's been here for.
[2610.10 --> 2610.58]  I know.
[2610.68 --> 2611.80]  Taryn's been here a long time.
[2612.96 --> 2616.62]  So, anyway, we cleared everything out of the old office.
[2616.62 --> 2619.06]  And he was like, holy crap.
[2619.26 --> 2620.76]  This place is huge.
[2620.76 --> 2621.12]  Yeah.
[2621.48 --> 2624.02]  It was so full of stuff.
[2624.40 --> 2629.00]  Like, floor to ceiling, full of stuff that you couldn't even tell how big it was.
[2629.04 --> 2631.66]  And stuff, like, I completely forgot.
[2631.74 --> 2633.58]  The whole chat is like, shut up.
[2633.82 --> 2636.70]  That there was an enormous window in the living room.
[2637.08 --> 2638.88]  Because we had a green screen in front of it.
[2638.88 --> 2638.90]  Yeah.
[2638.90 --> 2639.36]  Two of them.
[2639.40 --> 2640.44]  For two years.
[2640.58 --> 2641.74]  No, two giant windows.
[2641.74 --> 2642.00]  Yeah.
[2642.40 --> 2642.92]  Oh, my goodness.
[2642.92 --> 2646.46]  I had completely forgotten there was natural light in that building.
[2646.70 --> 2647.98]  Taking stuff down was interesting.
[2648.12 --> 2650.20]  Because I remember, like, when we were putting up that green screen.
[2650.44 --> 2651.68]  And you and me were like, oh, whatever.
[2651.82 --> 2654.24]  Let's go to Home Depot and just, like, buy random wire.
[2654.48 --> 2657.18]  Like, just screw it into the roof.
[2658.30 --> 2659.54]  I had to take that down.
[2659.60 --> 2661.34]  I was just like, this is so janky.
[2661.44 --> 2663.66]  Do you remember what a temporary solution that was?
[2663.66 --> 2663.88]  Okay.
[2664.14 --> 2664.36]  Okay.
[2664.50 --> 2671.14]  So, our plan, okay, was to get a really nice green screen.
[2671.74 --> 2673.60]  Like, material.
[2673.96 --> 2674.18]  Yeah.
[2674.40 --> 2676.26]  Like, a really great green screen.
[2676.44 --> 2679.24]  And, like, a really great huge stand.
[2679.88 --> 2683.88]  And temporarily, we were just like, oh, let's just order this cheap one on eBay.
[2684.70 --> 2688.14]  And, yeah, okay, yeah, let's just get this and we'll just build it.
[2688.22 --> 2690.28]  And hopefully that'll be fine until...
[2690.28 --> 2692.96]  Because I think we were originally going to put a green screen in the garage.
[2693.54 --> 2693.76]  Yeah.
[2694.22 --> 2695.74]  That never happened.
[2695.74 --> 2696.10]  No.
[2696.26 --> 2699.56]  The garage was floor to ceiling full of computer cases.
[2699.66 --> 2699.86]  Yeah.
[2700.02 --> 2700.42]  Always.
[2700.42 --> 2702.60]  And there was audio problems with the garage.
[2702.66 --> 2706.24]  There was barely any room to park one car.
[2706.74 --> 2712.06]  Like, you could, like, worry about knocking over a pile of cases or having cases fall onto
[2712.06 --> 2712.56]  a vehicle.
[2712.68 --> 2713.48]  Like, it was bad.
[2713.68 --> 2713.84]  Yeah.
[2713.84 --> 2718.26]  So, we got this, the cheapest green screen we could on eBay that would fit in the living room.
[2718.56 --> 2720.08]  Supposed to be a very temporary solution.
[2720.42 --> 2721.40]  We got it.
[2721.54 --> 2722.90]  And we were like, wow.
[2723.14 --> 2724.86]  This is the crappiest thing ever.
[2724.86 --> 2731.24]  So, the cool thing about that green screen was that the actual green screen fabric was, what,
[2731.24 --> 2731.72]  really long?
[2731.72 --> 2732.82]  About 10 feet high.
[2733.52 --> 2735.92]  And then it must have been about 30 feet long total.
[2735.92 --> 2736.76]  Really, really long.
[2736.78 --> 2737.78]  So, you could stand on it.
[2737.80 --> 2738.86]  You could do full body stuff.
[2739.00 --> 2739.78]  No, wait.
[2740.20 --> 2741.20]  No, you couldn't.
[2741.20 --> 2742.20]  The light was just right.
[2742.20 --> 2748.24]  Because the material was so sheer that because there was a window behind it, even though we
[2748.24 --> 2752.40]  had all the shutters closed, even the light leaking, right through it.
[2752.44 --> 2752.66]  Yeah.
[2752.66 --> 2754.62]  Just went right through it.
[2755.28 --> 2755.76]  Terrible.
[2755.76 --> 2756.40]  That's horrible.
[2756.56 --> 2758.40]  So, we had to fold it over three times.
[2759.66 --> 2765.90]  Then, when we did that, what happened was the weight of the fabric was so much that the
[2765.90 --> 2772.00]  cheap, crappy bar that goes between the two cheap, crappy stems bowed in the middle so you
[2772.00 --> 2773.38]  could never get the wrinkles.
[2773.38 --> 2773.80]  Yeah.
[2782.66 --> 2783.66]  Like that.
[2784.72 --> 2792.66]  Or like that, what we know is, what are futuro才american pierwsze paisancies that I am
[2792.66 --> 2793.66]  having compared to the light that happened on it.
[2793.66 --> 2796.42]  So, that point was given, was someone that you could never go behind come back ewes,
[2796.44 --> 2799.46]  and people used to study they were well-being and how I oscillate their ties with them.
[2799.46 --> 2801.60]  It nearly biết it zouden series.
[2802.32 --> 2805.28]  Cause why I was afraid of that, what were being Bono?
[2805.28 --> 2806.20]  Oh, go.
[2806.20 --> 2808.60]  Okay, continue this to be a littletuous bag acum.
[2808.66 --> 2811.00]  Menu, let's just like textbookcoming, Lenertale続zeit stuffEST.
[2811.00 --> 2840.98]  Thank you.
[2841.00 --> 2870.98]  Thank you.
[2871.00 --> 2871.92]  Is it? Is that the issue?
[2872.58 --> 2873.76]  Look how loose that is.
[2873.82 --> 2874.34]  What the heck?
[2875.54 --> 2876.84]  Oh, okay.
[2876.90 --> 2877.66]  Well, we're live again.
[2878.48 --> 2879.48]  So, okay.
[2879.48 --> 2882.02]  I think that's why I fixed it and didn't fix it.
[2882.14 --> 2883.42]  I unplugged it and plugged it back in.
[2883.56 --> 2883.90]  Okay.
[2883.90 --> 2884.86]  But I don't know if that was enough.
[2885.26 --> 2888.14]  So, one of the things that we've organized in the last little bit.
[2888.20 --> 2889.12]  Sorry about that, guys.
[2889.64 --> 2892.52]  We were just saying, I don't think we've ever had...
[2892.52 --> 2892.80]  Wow.
[2893.20 --> 2893.44]  There it is.
[2893.44 --> 2897.92]  We broke 10,000 live viewers for the first time ever on WAN Show.
[2897.92 --> 2900.80]  And we haven't covered a single real topic.
[2900.90 --> 2901.14]  Okay.
[2901.36 --> 2904.76]  Maybe we should do a real topic to celebrate.
[2905.76 --> 2906.16]  Really?
[2906.58 --> 2907.32]  No real topics?
[2907.66 --> 2909.90]  There is some pretty good stuff this week.
[2910.02 --> 2910.34]  There is.
[2910.34 --> 2910.92]  Are you sure?
[2910.92 --> 2913.24]  But we got 10K without any topics.
[2913.34 --> 2914.36]  Maybe that's what people want.
[2914.44 --> 2915.54]  That feels wrong.
[2916.18 --> 2917.26]  Oh, my goodness.
[2917.64 --> 2921.40]  That video that you filmed this week looks so amazing.
[2921.56 --> 2921.80]  Yes.
[2921.82 --> 2922.70]  Have you seen it?
[2922.80 --> 2924.80]  I have seen a very small part.
[2924.92 --> 2925.34]  Okay.
[2925.96 --> 2929.74]  Guys, I'm going to reveal something here that is amazing.
[2930.82 --> 2931.74]  So, wait.
[2933.00 --> 2933.52]  What?
[2933.90 --> 2934.60]  Is it out again?
[2936.22 --> 2936.74]  Hello?
[2936.90 --> 2937.10]  Hello?
[2937.62 --> 2937.90]  Oh, no.
[2937.98 --> 2938.38]  It's good.
[2938.60 --> 2939.06]  Sorry.
[2939.14 --> 2939.72]  I'm freaking out.
[2940.08 --> 2940.32]  Okay.
[2940.32 --> 2949.18]  So, we had a lot of requests from our viewers, okay, who like the kitchen set in the old house.
[2949.56 --> 2950.98]  They're like, yeah, you know what?
[2951.02 --> 2952.30]  It feels really real.
[2952.58 --> 2954.06]  It feels really homey.
[2954.62 --> 2960.44]  And so, we had a lot of requests to rebuild the kitchen set at the new office.
[2961.22 --> 2962.30]  We have done it.
[2963.50 --> 2968.36]  Luke will be hosting his G29 wheel review in the kitchen set.
[2968.36 --> 2974.22]  In spite of that being the first video shot here at the new office.
[2974.30 --> 2974.44]  Yep.
[2975.08 --> 2975.40]  And...
[2975.40 --> 2976.58]  You heard it here first, folks.
[2976.70 --> 2983.24]  Outside of just the kitchen being rebuilt, if you guys want to see more, like, racing wheel and joystick videos, be sure to let us know.
[2983.68 --> 2984.00]  Yeah.
[2984.00 --> 2984.44]  You know what?
[2984.48 --> 2988.94]  That's actually a really good thing for a straw pool here, I think.
[2990.68 --> 2992.62]  Racing wheel stuff.
[2992.72 --> 2993.76]  I mean, you've been using...
[2993.76 --> 2995.72]  You were using Project Cars for most of your testing, right?
[2995.88 --> 2996.18]  Yes.
[2996.98 --> 2998.40]  Project Cars is freaking great.
[2999.48 --> 3000.54]  It's super great.
[3001.24 --> 3005.32]  It makes me want to play racing games again, which makes me really happy.
[3005.96 --> 3008.02]  I'm glad we picked up a copy then.
[3008.26 --> 3008.58]  Yes.
[3009.08 --> 3009.42]  Me too.
[3009.96 --> 3011.32]  Did you have one of your own already?
[3011.90 --> 3012.48]  Project Cars?
[3012.54 --> 3012.68]  Yeah.
[3012.82 --> 3013.00]  No.
[3013.24 --> 3013.58]  Oh, okay.
[3013.76 --> 3015.00]  So, it's just on the benchmark account?
[3015.10 --> 3015.22]  Yeah.
[3015.34 --> 3015.84]  Okay, cool.
[3016.26 --> 3017.04]  Maybe I'll check it out too.
[3018.28 --> 3019.66]  I love the benchmark account.
[3019.80 --> 3020.84]  It's so great.
[3020.98 --> 3022.42]  Always the latest games.
[3022.66 --> 3024.10]  Always a business expense.
[3024.28 --> 3025.52]  Family and friends sharing.
[3026.04 --> 3026.40]  Yay!
[3027.18 --> 3027.88]  Did we say that?
[3028.28 --> 3028.58]  What?
[3028.86 --> 3029.42]  I don't know.
[3029.50 --> 3030.72]  Yeah, is it family and friends?
[3030.80 --> 3031.50]  I mean, we're friends.
[3032.38 --> 3032.78]  Yes.
[3032.78 --> 3034.96]  Whose account is it?
[3035.66 --> 3037.20]  It's, like, mine, right?
[3037.94 --> 3038.50]  Is it mine?
[3038.72 --> 3039.32]  Does it belong to Linus?
[3039.32 --> 3040.08]  Technically it is.
[3040.08 --> 3041.48]  No, it belongs to Linus Media Group.
[3041.52 --> 3042.48]  It's Linus Media Group.
[3042.66 --> 3045.08]  Right, but Linus Media Group is owned by me.
[3045.40 --> 3046.68]  But it's in my name.
[3046.94 --> 3047.52]  But it's...
[3047.52 --> 3048.22]  Okay, that's...
[3048.22 --> 3049.56]  That gets really confusing.
[3049.70 --> 3050.06]  Right, so...
[3050.06 --> 3055.04]  Okay, so if I'm your friend, then I can definitely use it.
[3055.62 --> 3061.34]  And if you work for Linus Media Group and you're my friend and I own Linus Media Group,
[3061.34 --> 3062.80]  then you can definitely use it.
[3062.96 --> 3063.74]  Yeah, I think it works.
[3064.14 --> 3064.44]  Yeah!
[3065.04 --> 3065.48]  Yeah.
[3065.52 --> 3065.74]  Yeah!
[3066.00 --> 3066.68]  I think it's fine.
[3066.84 --> 3067.74]  That should be no problem, right?
[3067.76 --> 3068.72]  Either way, that's...
[3068.72 --> 3071.64]  Like, most of the games I play on Steam these days is just...
[3071.64 --> 3075.00]  They come from the sharing from that account.
[3075.44 --> 3079.80]  Okay, so we've got 13% of people are party poopers.
[3081.94 --> 3082.40]  Oh.
[3082.96 --> 3084.12]  And do not turn up.
[3084.50 --> 3086.24]  And they do not racing wheel.
[3086.52 --> 3087.52]  That's super sad.
[3087.58 --> 3088.66]  So that is very unfortunate.
[3088.66 --> 3091.98]  So the Obato, should we try and find a place for it here?
[3092.36 --> 3092.64]  Yeah.
[3092.64 --> 3096.66]  Because I put it in a side room in my house, and then I have literally not touched it.
[3096.96 --> 3098.86]  And what I kind of want to do with that room instead...
[3098.86 --> 3100.58]  Have I told you my plan for that side room?
[3100.82 --> 3101.10]  No.
[3101.28 --> 3102.08]  Well, maybe...
[3102.08 --> 3102.42]  Okay.
[3102.62 --> 3103.72]  I thought it was for the Obato.
[3104.02 --> 3105.36]  Well, that was part of the plan.
[3105.52 --> 3105.74]  Okay.
[3105.74 --> 3106.94]  So I wanted to turn...
[3106.94 --> 3109.60]  So I have, like, this weird, like...
[3109.60 --> 3110.52]  I don't know what it is.
[3110.56 --> 3111.56]  What would you describe it as?
[3114.58 --> 3116.06]  Like, like...
[3116.06 --> 3119.28]  I don't know what to describe it as, but it's like a little hidden den thing that kids would
[3119.28 --> 3120.34]  love to go hide into.
[3120.34 --> 3120.62]  Yeah.
[3120.82 --> 3125.04]  And the reason, kids specifically, is that at its highest point, I think the ceiling is,
[3125.16 --> 3125.70]  like, six feet.
[3125.92 --> 3127.36]  And then the slope of the roof.
[3127.78 --> 3130.80]  Like, there's a room that's, like, right in the front of my house with the roof over
[3130.80 --> 3131.36]  top of it.
[3131.52 --> 3135.56]  And there was only so much flat, sort of normal ceiling height room.
[3135.64 --> 3140.56]  And then after that, there's these two weird rooms that have the slope of the roof interfering
[3140.56 --> 3140.96]  with them.
[3140.98 --> 3142.02]  And they're really small.
[3142.22 --> 3145.32]  So I was planning to just have the Obato in one of them.
[3145.42 --> 3150.24]  And then I was going to get a CRT TV and, like, a bunch of retro consoles and a beanbag
[3150.24 --> 3150.64]  chair.
[3150.76 --> 3153.78]  And I was just going to have, like, this weird little, like, gaming den thing.
[3154.36 --> 3156.40]  But I put the Obato in there.
[3156.40 --> 3159.28]  It takes up, like, half of the room.
[3161.48 --> 3165.14]  And I think I just kind of give up.
[3165.36 --> 3168.50]  So I still want to do the retro gaming thing.
[3168.68 --> 3172.06]  But then I could have room for a couple beanbag chairs or, like, four beanbag chairs.
[3172.16 --> 3173.44]  Play some Mario Kart 64.
[3173.84 --> 3175.48]  I think that might actually be better.
[3176.06 --> 3179.18]  So if we can find room for it here, maybe we'll just move it back here.
[3179.22 --> 3183.04]  And then we can just use it whenever we do our reviews of, like, wheels and joysticks.
[3183.04 --> 3185.52]  That's why I said I wanted to keep it, actually, is that would be cool.
[3185.52 --> 3191.84]  One thing that I'm super excited for is not only VR testing in terms of graphics cards,
[3192.64 --> 3195.48]  because I think that's going to be interesting, because we're going to have to start looking
[3195.48 --> 3196.52]  at minimums a lot more.
[3196.68 --> 3200.50]  And I have, like, a whole thing planned for that in many ways.
[3200.50 --> 3206.72]  When I was playing Project Cars, and I started getting really into it with the racing wheel,
[3206.82 --> 3210.46]  and there's force feedback, and everything's awesome, and I'm like, if I was just wearing an Oculus,
[3210.62 --> 3212.44]  this would be so cool right now.
[3213.90 --> 3215.50]  And I want to...
[3215.50 --> 3217.78]  I'm going to pitch this to you on camera.
[3218.04 --> 3218.48]  Oh, wow.
[3218.48 --> 3219.40]  No pressure, though.
[3219.40 --> 3224.52]  When I was in Taiwan, when we went to that really cool tech mall, there was a guy there.
[3225.72 --> 3226.64]  I thought it was...
[3226.64 --> 3228.78]  I think it was, like, Jack's Racing.
[3229.36 --> 3230.14]  Jack's Racing.
[3230.56 --> 3230.92]  Gotcha.
[3230.92 --> 3240.08]  He was an official, like, French race driver, and if you took this course with him, you
[3240.08 --> 3243.76]  could get your driving certificate to be able to race in, like, competitive racing stuff.
[3243.80 --> 3244.34]  It was crazy.
[3244.66 --> 3246.96]  That tech mall had a lot of really weird stuff in it.
[3247.58 --> 3248.64]  But he had...
[3248.64 --> 3248.66]  Okay.
[3248.82 --> 3250.80]  He had this $50,000 unit.
[3250.90 --> 3251.82]  I'm not saying we buy it.
[3252.04 --> 3252.44]  Don't worry.
[3252.64 --> 3253.66]  I'm not saying we buy it at all.
[3253.66 --> 3255.22]  Is it the one that can spin freely?
[3255.84 --> 3260.46]  It can spin freely, and, like, if you go around a corner and crash, it's like, boom,
[3260.54 --> 3261.90]  and the whole thing freaks out.
[3262.00 --> 3262.78]  I've seen it.
[3262.86 --> 3264.28]  I contacted them already.
[3264.52 --> 3264.92]  Oh.
[3265.82 --> 3267.12]  I wasn't even going to say that.
[3267.20 --> 3268.36]  I want us to build our own.
[3268.88 --> 3270.58]  It is not worth it.
[3270.92 --> 3271.24]  Oh.
[3272.38 --> 3272.74]  Okay.
[3273.48 --> 3276.22]  I have straight up looked into this.
[3276.58 --> 3277.48]  Well, yeah.
[3277.82 --> 3278.98]  It is horrifying.
[3278.98 --> 3279.62]  Okay, wait, no.
[3279.70 --> 3282.32]  His wasn't to spin freely, because it wasn't a spaceship one.
[3282.78 --> 3283.66]  Okay, there's...
[3283.66 --> 3285.98]  His was planted, and it would lean.
[3286.14 --> 3297.56]  Okay, there's one that is, I think, closer to $80,000 or, like, maybe $150,000 that can
[3297.56 --> 3304.10]  not only lean and tilt and rock, but it can actually spin freely.
[3304.24 --> 3306.06]  So you could spin out in it.
[3306.16 --> 3310.80]  And then it can go as many times as you want in one direction without losing the connection.
[3311.18 --> 3311.28]  Wow.
[3311.38 --> 3312.72]  So it doesn't twist up.
[3312.94 --> 3313.32]  Wow.
[3313.32 --> 3315.32]  So that is...
[3316.14 --> 3319.72]  Like, the only people who buy this are, like, for...
[3319.72 --> 3321.26]  It's, like, a showcase piece.
[3321.56 --> 3322.72]  Or, like, simulation tester.
[3322.84 --> 3325.02]  They custom build every single unit.
[3325.22 --> 3327.42]  It's, like, a family that builds them or something.
[3327.54 --> 3333.90]  Like, I actually contacted them, and I was like, so, you know, how much is it?
[3333.92 --> 3334.82]  I'm just curious.
[3335.04 --> 3336.36]  And it was some horrifying number.
[3336.42 --> 3337.70]  I've even blocked it from my memory.
[3337.76 --> 3338.30]  I don't remember.
[3338.30 --> 3340.82]  Like, it might have been a quarter million dollars.
[3340.82 --> 3342.08]  Like, it was horrifying.
[3342.08 --> 3345.60]  Like, we're talking Saudi princes are ordering this thing.
[3345.70 --> 3347.08]  Not Linus Media Group.
[3347.20 --> 3347.40]  Yeah.
[3347.40 --> 3352.46]  And honestly, without the ability to spin, I don't know if I'm that sold on it.
[3353.16 --> 3353.46]  You know?
[3353.46 --> 3354.64]  It was pretty good.
[3354.98 --> 3355.16]  Yeah?
[3355.16 --> 3363.28]  Because when you spin out in the one that I had, it would do this really hardcore.
[3363.48 --> 3363.94]  Right.
[3363.94 --> 3364.48]  Okay.
[3364.48 --> 3368.54]  You feel, like, there's so much movement going on that you kind of feel like...
[3368.54 --> 3370.56]  Like, it's just disorienting kind of thing.
[3370.72 --> 3370.82]  Yeah.
[3370.82 --> 3370.88]  Right?
[3370.94 --> 3371.60]  That makes sense.
[3371.70 --> 3376.48]  And, like, if you were to do a burn out, it's just going to lean you really hardcore to the one way.
[3376.80 --> 3377.00]  Oh.
[3377.00 --> 3379.04]  So it's going to feel like you're being pulled around the curve.
[3379.28 --> 3379.50]  Right.
[3379.50 --> 3382.02]  It wouldn't work for certain things.
[3382.10 --> 3382.50]  Right.
[3382.88 --> 3384.34]  But it's usually fine.
[3384.58 --> 3385.30]  You mean spin out?
[3387.18 --> 3387.82]  Like, if you...
[3387.82 --> 3388.26]  Oh, yes.
[3388.50 --> 3388.90]  Donut.
[3388.98 --> 3389.20]  Sorry.
[3389.44 --> 3389.70]  Okay.
[3389.70 --> 3390.28]  I didn't say donut.
[3390.48 --> 3390.58]  Yeah.
[3391.90 --> 3392.58]  You know what?
[3392.60 --> 3394.12]  We should probably do our sponsor spot.
[3394.12 --> 3396.12]  We have only one sponsor today.
[3396.42 --> 3397.44]  Linda.com.
[3397.48 --> 3397.92]  Linda.
[3398.50 --> 3398.78]  Wait.
[3399.12 --> 3399.76]  Oh, crap.
[3399.86 --> 3401.04]  That's the wrong lower third.
[3401.22 --> 3401.72]  Dang it.
[3402.38 --> 3402.82]  Luke.
[3403.02 --> 3403.46]  What?
[3403.50 --> 3404.62]  That wasn't my fault at all.
[3405.36 --> 3406.24]  No, I don't believe it was.
[3406.24 --> 3407.18]  I even found you the right one.
[3407.20 --> 3407.44]  Yeah.
[3407.66 --> 3410.54]  I actually legitimately did not.
[3410.54 --> 3411.80]  Linda.com.
[3412.08 --> 3413.88]  More than 3,000 courses available.
[3415.62 --> 3416.54]  Blah, blah, blah.
[3417.16 --> 3420.36]  There might even be one on creating something like this lower third.
[3420.36 --> 3420.86]  Oh, that one has a logo.
[3421.02 --> 3421.64]  That one has a logo.
[3421.74 --> 3422.44]  Oh, God.
[3422.52 --> 3423.16]  Oh, oh.
[3423.16 --> 3423.76]  We're gone.
[3423.76 --> 3424.50]  Oh, crap.
[3424.76 --> 3425.84]  We'll be back.
[3425.96 --> 3426.80]  Oh, crap.
[3427.06 --> 3427.76]  Every Friday.
[3427.96 --> 3428.88]  Every Friday.
[3428.98 --> 3432.38]  At 4.30 plus or minus 30, but only plus, never minus.
[3433.44 --> 3435.58]  We should start early sometime.
[3435.80 --> 3437.36]  I do that every time you're not here.
[3437.48 --> 3438.16]  Oh, all right.
[3438.22 --> 3438.82]  Well, whatever.
[3439.56 --> 3440.70]  Linda.com.
[3440.76 --> 3441.00]  Linda.com.
[3441.00 --> 3447.80]  The place to learn online when you're not learning from us about how to stall for literally an hour.
[3447.80 --> 3450.68]  And almost a half.
[3450.68 --> 3451.96]  And almost a half.
[3451.96 --> 3452.48]  Woo!
[3452.48 --> 3452.88]  Woo!
[3452.88 --> 3452.92]  Woo!
[3452.92 --> 3453.04]  Woo!
[3453.04 --> 3453.48]  Woo!
[3453.48 --> 3460.72]  So they've got all kinds of great courses, whether it's coding, business, Photoshop, Adobe Premiere,
[3461.22 --> 3465.92]  you know, learning new job skills, or just getting better at a hobby like photography.
[3465.92 --> 3470.92]  Head over to Linda.com slash WANshow and get a 10-day trial for free.
[3471.04 --> 3471.90]  All you can eat.
[3472.30 --> 3477.44]  Linda.com is great for accessing through your browser and, like, you know, streaming the videos.
[3477.64 --> 3483.24]  Hey, but they also support downloading them and watching them back on your Android or iOS device.
[3483.24 --> 3486.40]  You can create playlists that you can share with your friends so you guys can learn together.
[3486.40 --> 3492.46]  I actually know a few people that use the offline feature already because of stuff like the SkyTrain.
[3493.16 --> 3493.42]  Yep.
[3493.42 --> 3497.44]  They get the SkyTrain into Vancouver to go to work and the SkyTrain will go through tunnels and you'll lose signals.
[3497.54 --> 3499.14]  So you can't really stream video the whole time.
[3499.48 --> 3500.82]  So download it and then watch on SkyTrain.
[3500.84 --> 3506.50]  To be clear, the SkyTrain is us being Canadian and calling a monorail a SkyTrain.
[3507.20 --> 3509.92]  For those of you who don't know what a SkyTrain is, it's a monorail.
[3510.12 --> 3511.06]  It's not in the sky at all.
[3511.28 --> 3511.44]  Yeah.
[3511.44 --> 3511.92]  It's on a rail.
[3511.92 --> 3512.92]  It's on a rail.
[3513.24 --> 3514.18]  And there's one rail.
[3514.40 --> 3515.34]  And it's called a monorail.
[3515.44 --> 3515.62]  Yeah.
[3515.98 --> 3517.34]  I don't understand.
[3517.82 --> 3518.24]  So, right.
[3518.30 --> 3519.64]  That was lynda.com slash my own show.
[3519.80 --> 3523.40]  I don't understand why we have to call it something special.
[3524.52 --> 3528.30]  Like, why can't we just call it what it is?
[3528.30 --> 3529.06]  Because TransLink.
[3529.10 --> 3530.22]  This is the monorail.
[3530.30 --> 3530.52]  Monorail.
[3530.52 --> 3531.68]  The Vancouver monorail.
[3533.14 --> 3534.06]  I wish it was called monorail.
[3534.06 --> 3538.34]  I'm sweating, like, so hardcore through my shirt right now.
[3538.48 --> 3539.90]  But you know what's cool about it?
[3539.96 --> 3540.54]  Check this out.
[3540.54 --> 3544.98]  Is I'm actually, like, I'm, like, sweating my cut abs.
[3545.32 --> 3546.10]  Oh, wow.
[3547.30 --> 3547.72]  Wow.
[3549.22 --> 3549.70]  Wow.
[3550.32 --> 3550.76]  Wow.
[3551.14 --> 3552.48]  That's not what's happening.
[3552.64 --> 3552.90]  No.
[3556.48 --> 3557.14]  At all.
[3557.14 --> 3559.46]  I don't think this is what is happening.
[3559.60 --> 3561.60]  But that would be more likely if you had rolls.
[3562.86 --> 3563.34]  Oh.
[3563.72 --> 3564.96]  I don't think that's what's happening.
[3564.98 --> 3567.12]  Don't make me prove I don't have rolls on the show again.
[3567.14 --> 3567.68]  That's what I...
[3567.68 --> 3568.04]  No.
[3568.04 --> 3569.44]  No one wants to see that.
[3569.52 --> 3570.30]  He doesn't have rolls.
[3570.30 --> 3574.62]  Speaking of not wanting to see that, what is up with Dennis's nipple being in the moving vlog?
[3575.62 --> 3577.78]  Why is it all over the moving vlog?
[3577.82 --> 3578.68]  Because he was naked.
[3579.02 --> 3579.96]  Why was he naked?
[3580.08 --> 3580.88]  For, like, a day.
[3581.46 --> 3583.60]  Does he not understand our culture here?
[3583.60 --> 3586.26]  It was only him and Burkle at the old office.
[3586.28 --> 3587.74]  And so they, like...
[3587.74 --> 3589.02]  Yeah.
[3589.56 --> 3590.74]  That's why they took so long.
[3591.02 --> 3592.28]  Remember when they were late with the U-Haul?
[3592.42 --> 3593.14]  By, like, an hour?
[3593.32 --> 3594.32]  Oh, that's right.
[3594.58 --> 3595.94]  Burkle lasts a little while.
[3596.32 --> 3596.72]  Wow.
[3596.92 --> 3597.90]  They were really late.
[3598.04 --> 3598.28]  Yeah.
[3599.00 --> 3600.76]  I gotta get some tips from that guy.
[3602.04 --> 3603.14]  Or at least one.
[3605.46 --> 3606.26]  Gerth Birks.
[3607.18 --> 3608.06]  Gerth Birks.
[3608.52 --> 3612.98]  I feel so bad about the Channel Super Fun upload schedule.
[3613.56 --> 3613.66]  Yeah.
[3613.66 --> 3614.70]  Like, straight up bad.
[3614.86 --> 3616.04]  You know whose fault it is?
[3616.30 --> 3616.86]  Nick Light.
[3617.74 --> 3620.74]  No, he's been really busy.
[3620.82 --> 3621.46]  Like, I get it.
[3621.56 --> 3626.08]  Because there's been vacations and there's been moving and there's been all this stuff that's been going on.
[3626.16 --> 3629.88]  And normally, I'm helping him with a lot of the stuff that he does.
[3630.04 --> 3632.08]  And I've been completely consumed by the move.
[3632.18 --> 3635.76]  Like, basically, I look at my email once per day right now.
[3636.24 --> 3637.02]  That's it.
[3637.32 --> 3641.36]  I blitz through, like, 80 to 100 emails every night throughout the move.
[3641.78 --> 3643.82]  And other than that, I'm not looking at anything.
[3643.82 --> 3644.82]  So, I'm...
[3644.82 --> 3646.80]  He'd, like, walk up.
[3646.80 --> 3649.80]  He'd be like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3649.96 --> 3651.10]  I'm like, no.
[3652.20 --> 3653.08]  Not right now.
[3654.44 --> 3657.94]  So, he's like, okay, I'll figure it out on my own.
[3658.44 --> 3660.42]  So, he's been getting LTT up.
[3660.56 --> 3663.08]  And then the other channels haven't been...
[3663.08 --> 3666.24]  Someone just said you should make up for it by offering tours of the new office.
[3666.56 --> 3667.18]  We are.
[3667.28 --> 3667.94]  We are.
[3668.16 --> 3668.40]  Yeah.
[3668.48 --> 3669.12]  Straight up.
[3669.24 --> 3670.28]  August 21st.
[3670.36 --> 3670.60]  Yeah.
[3670.84 --> 3673.26]  I've heard people are actually flying into this.
[3673.50 --> 3673.60]  Yeah.
[3674.10 --> 3677.14]  That is some hardcore stuff right there.
[3677.14 --> 3677.84]  That's super cool.
[3677.84 --> 3678.40]  Yeah.
[3678.40 --> 3680.36]  I mean, I will be...
[3680.36 --> 3681.08]  I'll be...
[3681.08 --> 3683.50]  I'll still be amazed if anyone actually does it.
[3683.62 --> 3687.02]  But I've seen a number of people saying that they're planning to do it.
[3687.06 --> 3688.40]  So, I guess we better not move the day.
[3688.48 --> 3688.64]  Hey.
[3688.80 --> 3689.16]  Ha ha.
[3689.50 --> 3689.90]  Yeah.
[3689.90 --> 3690.20]  Yeah.
[3690.50 --> 3690.84]  No, we are...
[3690.84 --> 3691.36]  Don't do it better.
[3691.36 --> 3692.18]  We actually...
[3692.18 --> 3693.06]  We set it.
[3693.44 --> 3694.30]  This is funny.
[3694.60 --> 3701.16]  Back on the subject of the ETA for completion of the new office, we had originally set in
[3701.16 --> 3706.08]  our calendar the day of the tours and the meetup.
[3706.14 --> 3706.98]  Let's just call it the meetup.
[3707.22 --> 3708.80]  The meetup and garage sale day.
[3709.14 --> 3710.00]  Is it out again?
[3710.10 --> 3710.40]  Pop.
[3710.94 --> 3711.22]  Yep.
[3715.22 --> 3717.00]  We've got to throw in the cable when we're done.
[3717.28 --> 3717.90]  Yes, we do.
[3717.94 --> 3718.12]  Yep.
[3718.18 --> 3718.56]  Blah, blah.
[3718.66 --> 3719.04]  Yep, we're good.
[3719.26 --> 3719.54]  Okay.
[3719.54 --> 3723.58]  So, we had originally set the day for the meetup for like a week ago.
[3724.16 --> 3724.48]  Yeah.
[3724.74 --> 3725.96]  We would straight up...
[3725.96 --> 3729.62]  It would have straight up been a dangerous construction site here.
[3730.06 --> 3730.46]  Yeah.
[3730.72 --> 3733.30]  It would have not been safe to have the meetup.
[3734.30 --> 3737.22]  So, I'm really glad that we actually ended up moving it.
[3737.28 --> 3738.82]  We buffered by like a month.
[3739.28 --> 3739.62]  Yeah.
[3740.10 --> 3741.48]  And it looks like by the time...
[3741.48 --> 3743.66]  We'll probably end up eating a lot of that buffer.
[3743.86 --> 3744.06]  Yeah.
[3744.26 --> 3748.60]  So, it's probably going to be a week before we're like up and running here.
[3748.60 --> 3752.86]  And then I would say it's going to be like a couple months before everything's like perfect.
[3753.08 --> 3753.32]  Oh, yeah.
[3753.54 --> 3755.02]  But it will be...
[3755.02 --> 3756.60]  It won't be perfect by the time you guys show up.
[3756.62 --> 3757.56]  But it'll be pretty good.
[3757.64 --> 3761.12]  On August 21st, we're going to have the meetup and garage sale.
[3761.22 --> 3763.14]  And we hope that it's going to be pretty awesome.
[3763.30 --> 3764.02]  I think like...
[3764.02 --> 3764.28]  Okay.
[3764.82 --> 3766.92]  It will be very good by the time you guys show up.
[3766.92 --> 3770.92]  By perfect, I mean like we'll be settled in and kind of know...
[3772.44 --> 3773.28]  Back to the routine.
[3773.50 --> 3774.30]  The feel of it a lot more.
[3774.40 --> 3774.80]  Yeah, yeah.
[3774.80 --> 3775.04]  Exactly.
[3775.04 --> 3775.40]  Back to the routine.
[3775.52 --> 3775.88]  Because there's a lot of...
[3775.88 --> 3777.80]  Everything will feel more automatic.
[3778.06 --> 3780.68]  Because there's a lot of stuff that we're just going to have to straight up custom build.
[3780.78 --> 3783.66]  Like we've been thinking about cables a lot.
[3783.66 --> 3786.14]  And I think what we're going to do...
[3786.14 --> 3787.58]  Actually, I wanted to run this by you.
[3787.84 --> 3788.06]  Okay.
[3788.12 --> 3790.34]  So you know the wall outside the server room?
[3790.42 --> 3790.68]  Yes.
[3790.94 --> 3791.22]  Okay.
[3791.94 --> 3798.80]  The original plan for that wall was to have tables and then like a Velcro wall that we
[3798.80 --> 3801.66]  could stick chargers to for...
[3801.66 --> 3804.56]  And so the table and the wall would just be all chargers.
[3804.88 --> 3809.88]  And you could have like camera stuff chargers and like drone chargers and battery chargers and
[3809.88 --> 3810.14]  whatever.
[3810.14 --> 3811.38]  So...
[3811.38 --> 3817.90]  Burkle wants to take up about half of the wall with like these massive steel rods that
[3817.90 --> 3818.72]  stick out of the wall.
[3818.90 --> 3821.16]  And then you just hang cables on them by type.
[3822.38 --> 3826.78]  Do you think that seems like we should do it or should we just have bins of cables?
[3827.20 --> 3829.68]  Because that helps them take up almost no space.
[3830.84 --> 3833.52]  And they're really easy to access as well.
[3833.62 --> 3835.80]  Especially for heavy stuff like extension cables.
[3836.90 --> 3837.80]  Extension cords.
[3838.10 --> 3839.14]  Are they technically a cable?
[3839.22 --> 3839.80]  I can't remember.
[3840.82 --> 3842.02]  They're definitely cords.
[3842.24 --> 3842.44]  Yeah.
[3842.52 --> 3843.32]  But they might not be...
[3843.32 --> 3844.24]  But they might be cables.
[3844.76 --> 3845.90]  I think they're cables.
[3846.02 --> 3846.16]  Anyway.
[3846.16 --> 3847.64]  I always have to re-reference that video.
[3847.72 --> 3848.26]  I know.
[3848.68 --> 3850.14]  There's so many crossover...
[3850.14 --> 3852.90]  Surprisingly few people have watched the cables...
[3852.90 --> 3854.02]  Probably like a quarter me.
[3854.30 --> 3855.70]  Cables versus wires.
[3856.32 --> 3858.00]  I think is what it's called.
[3858.54 --> 3858.76]  Yeah.
[3858.82 --> 3860.62]  That only has 167,000 views.
[3860.70 --> 3861.96]  That's pretty low for a tech quickie.
[3862.00 --> 3863.46]  But yeah, that's a fair amount of just me.
[3864.48 --> 3866.50]  Probably make up like at least 100 of those views.
[3866.50 --> 3867.56]  So what do you think of that idea?
[3867.78 --> 3868.42]  I don't mind it.
[3868.42 --> 3870.34]  Maybe not for everything.
[3870.64 --> 3872.10]  We don't need a micro USB...
[3872.94 --> 3873.38]  No.
[3873.98 --> 3874.64]  But like...
[3874.64 --> 3875.50]  But like Ethernet.
[3875.96 --> 3878.30]  Ethernet, extension cords...
[3878.30 --> 3879.48]  And then you can do it by length.
[3879.48 --> 3879.72]  Maybe some HDMI.
[3880.26 --> 3881.06]  You can do it by length.
[3881.44 --> 3881.62]  Yeah.
[3881.62 --> 3884.60]  So like Ethernet over 10 meters, Ethernet under 10 meters.
[3885.02 --> 3891.18]  And then the 10 meter cables we can just like scatter around everywhere because they fit in nowhere.
[3891.18 --> 3894.98]  Things that'll be giant and take up like a whole freaking drawer anyways.
[3895.18 --> 3895.38]  Yeah.
[3895.46 --> 3897.02]  I think makes sense to go up on things.
[3897.22 --> 3902.40]  And there's like a lot of stuff that we meant to have done before we moved in and straight up never got to.
[3902.48 --> 3906.54]  Like the shelves for the benchmarking room never got done.
[3906.66 --> 3909.30]  So we're just going to have to hammer away at that.
[3909.66 --> 3910.94]  Get everything sorted out.
[3910.98 --> 3912.00]  Did we just not order those?
[3912.00 --> 3918.36]  Well, the plan was we were going to get them from that person on Craigslist and then they bailed.
[3918.46 --> 3919.56]  And then we found some...
[3919.56 --> 3923.58]  The plan as far as I knew for so long was that we were just having contractors build them.
[3923.74 --> 3924.12]  Yeah.
[3924.72 --> 3925.72]  That's expensive.
[3926.48 --> 3933.20]  And then I think the contractor told us that it's actually more economical to Frankenstein together IKEA stuff.
[3933.20 --> 3939.44]  And so we're maybe doing that, but then there's something that I don't know.
[3939.66 --> 3942.20]  Also, we never did find a plan for...
[3942.78 --> 3943.98]  We wanted to build...
[3943.98 --> 3946.38]  This is actually surprisingly rare.
[3946.80 --> 3955.76]  There's one Rubbermaid product and that was all I could find for like a bin that's designed to be like kind of a drawer.
[3956.06 --> 3958.26]  But then you can also remove it and it's just a bin.
[3958.26 --> 3960.78]  So we want that for our workbench tables.
[3960.90 --> 3965.34]  And I found a great DIY project on YouTube, but that was like it.
[3965.58 --> 3967.88]  There's like one guy who DIY'd it.
[3968.10 --> 3977.70]  And there's no bins that are specifically built with really rigid sides so that they don't fold and then fall out in that kind of a configuration.
[3977.70 --> 3979.72]  That seems like the most obvious thing ever to me.
[3979.72 --> 3979.96]  Yeah.
[3980.32 --> 3980.50]  Yeah.
[3980.66 --> 3983.30]  Like a rail system bin kind of thing.
[3983.30 --> 3983.48]  Yeah.
[3983.48 --> 3989.28]  It's possible we could find like a pre-done thing and then just Frankenstein that.
[3989.38 --> 3990.68]  Just pull the actual drawers out of it.
[3990.68 --> 3999.20]  The problem with rail bin things is that a lot of times you need something for the bin to sit on because too much weight on the far side.
[3999.30 --> 4000.78]  The bin is just going to fold in and fall.
[4001.06 --> 4001.18]  Yeah.
[4001.18 --> 4004.54]  So I don't even think it would be that hard to make.
[4004.62 --> 4007.20]  So there's a lot of things still left to figure out.
[4007.34 --> 4009.36]  You know, we want to build like a lighting grid.
[4009.36 --> 4020.14]  Like, so that's like a, like a, like a metal structure that sits over the sets that we can actually like clamp lights to instead of having just floor standing lights all the time.
[4020.14 --> 4020.34]  Yeah.
[4020.66 --> 4022.60]  Because my goal is to keep the warehouse clean.
[4024.08 --> 4027.20]  I want to do something about concrete dust at some point.
[4027.44 --> 4027.88]  Oh.
[4028.12 --> 4035.62]  So maybe we, we're going to have to like move everything to one side, seal the floor, move everything to the other side, seal the rest of the floor.
[4035.62 --> 4041.28]  Like we are so far away from it being perfect, perfect, but we've made a lot of progress.
[4041.40 --> 4042.14]  We're really excited.
[4042.52 --> 4045.64]  Should we do one tech topic just for old time's sake?
[4046.96 --> 4047.36]  Sure.
[4047.54 --> 4047.84]  Okay.
[4047.92 --> 4050.54]  Why don't we, why don't we rapid fire through a few of these?
[4050.60 --> 4050.92]  Okay.
[4051.22 --> 4051.46]  So.
[4051.46 --> 4053.12]  A lot of these don't need a ton of explanations.
[4053.48 --> 4055.26]  No, they super don't.
[4055.26 --> 4058.84]  So here's the Ars Technica article for this one.
[4058.92 --> 4060.42]  Do you want to post them to Twitch chat?
[4060.80 --> 4061.04]  Sure.
[4061.24 --> 4063.64]  Model S is going to have autonomous steering and parking.
[4063.64 --> 4065.56]  It's a level two autonomous vehicle.
[4065.80 --> 4067.80]  There's levels zero through four.
[4067.98 --> 4068.96]  Four is fully autonomous.
[4069.14 --> 4070.42]  Zero is not autonomous at all.
[4070.80 --> 4075.34]  Autonomous parking has been done before and actually a very long time ago.
[4075.34 --> 4075.46]  Yeah.
[4075.46 --> 4076.40]  It's like 10 years ago.
[4076.70 --> 4080.30]  But only in, well, that one was only available in one area.
[4080.58 --> 4080.78]  So like.
[4080.78 --> 4080.94]  Yeah.
[4081.70 --> 4083.20]  Toyota did it in Japan.
[4083.42 --> 4088.24]  And like the one series that I demoed a little while ago, that had it.
[4088.58 --> 4089.38]  Stuff like that.
[4089.42 --> 4092.04]  It's not, autonomous parking isn't very new.
[4092.04 --> 4099.82]  I think the bigger news here is simply the fact that, this is simply the contrast between
[4099.82 --> 4106.18]  Tesla's approach to updating their cars and the traditional automakers approach to updating
[4106.18 --> 4106.88]  their cars.
[4107.20 --> 4113.70]  Traditional automakers, you have to make a huge splash in the news about their car being
[4113.70 --> 4115.24]  literally hacked.
[4115.76 --> 4122.04]  Whereas Tesla is like, let's add functionality to our car throughout its life cycle and add
[4122.04 --> 4125.42]  additional value that wasn't on the original spec sheet to the customer.
[4125.88 --> 4132.74]  When is the last, I would love for you guys to correct me if I'm wrong, but has any car
[4132.74 --> 4137.78]  maker ever updated the firmware to add new functionality to their car?
[4137.78 --> 4140.84]  Like think about all these cars with built-in dashes and like.
[4140.84 --> 4143.02]  And not something that was announced and didn't come with it.
[4143.10 --> 4143.34]  Yeah.
[4143.64 --> 4143.84]  Yeah.
[4143.86 --> 4147.92]  Like something that straight up, you had no idea that that was coming.
[4148.50 --> 4151.62]  Um, you know, like, like you think about the, the onboard computers in these cars.
[4151.62 --> 4155.18]  Like you even have to pay for your map updates after the.
[4155.26 --> 4157.70]  A map update for my car is like $500.
[4158.38 --> 4158.68]  Yeah.
[4159.00 --> 4159.82]  Like it's absurd.
[4160.00 --> 4160.36]  What?
[4160.36 --> 4162.96]  It's absolutely absurd.
[4163.78 --> 4165.24]  Apparently Volvo did.
[4165.42 --> 4168.58]  Apparently Hyundai did with the Sonata for Android Auto.
[4169.56 --> 4170.12]  Okay.
[4170.84 --> 4172.18]  Oh, but it's Android Auto.
[4173.32 --> 4174.24]  I don't know.
[4175.58 --> 4177.74]  So I think Android Auto had an update.
[4178.78 --> 4183.96]  But, but much like the phone, like Android updates for phones, it probably had to be implemented
[4183.96 --> 4185.22]  and vetted by Hyundai.
[4185.40 --> 4185.46]  Right.
[4185.90 --> 4186.34]  Okay.
[4186.94 --> 4187.76]  Well, there you go.
[4187.76 --> 4190.36]  The Mercedes apparently comes with wheels included.
[4190.48 --> 4191.10]  Thank you for that.
[4191.18 --> 4193.08]  This is why I don't talk to you guys, Twitch chat.
[4193.44 --> 4194.64]  I talk to Twitch chat.
[4194.72 --> 4195.02]  Yeah.
[4195.22 --> 4196.74]  Actually, I love you guys, Twitch chat.
[4196.90 --> 4198.12]  You make, you make.
[4198.22 --> 4200.46]  It's all about proactive mental filtering.
[4200.78 --> 4203.74]  You just got to sort through the whole Twitch chat as it goes.
[4203.94 --> 4205.18]  So this is hilarious.
[4205.50 --> 4208.52]  You know how Kim Kardashian figured she could break the internet?
[4209.92 --> 4211.84]  Um, with like a nude pic or whatever.
[4212.44 --> 4216.28]  Windows 10 straight up almost broke the internet.
[4216.28 --> 4218.90]  Um, the rollout of Windows 10.
[4219.08 --> 4222.90]  How much did Microsoft, uh, set aside for themselves?
[4223.90 --> 4232.78]  Um, Microsoft Windows 10, um, internet congestion.
[4232.78 --> 4235.46]  I actually, this isn't, this isn't in the doc.
[4236.06 --> 4237.60]  Um, so blah, blah, blah.
[4237.70 --> 4242.76]  Windows 10 rollout will break internet traffic records.
[4242.76 --> 4248.14]  So they set aside some terabit blah, blah, blah speed.
[4248.14 --> 4252.44]  And apparently they, they are just absolutely smashing it.
[4252.52 --> 4252.76]  Okay.
[4252.86 --> 4253.44]  Based on comfort.
[4253.60 --> 4254.66]  According to Rayburn.
[4254.66 --> 4258.38]  And this is based on conversations he had with sources.
[4258.78 --> 4260.76]  So take all this with a grain of salt.
[4260.96 --> 4261.08]  Cool.
[4261.28 --> 4270.16]  Microsoft has reserved up to 40 terabit per second capacity from multiple content delivery networks or CDNs.
[4270.16 --> 4279.70]  By comparison, Apple's release of iOS 8 last year crested at about three terabit per second.
[4279.70 --> 4288.58]  And other major web events, including some of Apple's most widely watched live stream presentations, peaked at eight terabit per second.
[4289.36 --> 4295.76]  Now, bear in mind, you guys, that Windows 10 is a massive file compared to an iOS update.
[4295.76 --> 4299.52]  So the sustained transfer is going to be longer.
[4299.52 --> 4301.20]  It'll last longer and then total to a higher amount.
[4301.46 --> 4308.02]  And this ties in really nicely to Luke's big told you so news topic, which is huge.
[4308.02 --> 4311.86]  The pirates are successfully upgrading to Windows 10 for free.
[4311.86 --> 4319.18]  If you cracked Windows 7 very well, it works with Windows 8 too, but it was much easier with Windows 7.
[4319.28 --> 4330.66]  If you cracked it very well and convinced Windows that you had a real version and then got the upgrade, your key was then recycled and turned into a new Windows 10 key, which was validated.
[4330.66 --> 4333.12]  So you just are winning.
[4333.42 --> 4335.70]  There's some people that are being detected.
[4336.18 --> 4339.28]  And when they upgrade, it's like, oh, you need a Windows 10 key.
[4339.40 --> 4340.38]  Haha, you're screwed.
[4340.64 --> 4343.06]  But that's a very low percentage.
[4343.76 --> 4348.84]  So the pirates are pretty big fans of Windows 10 right now.
[4348.84 --> 4356.78]  I have to imagine, I have to imagine that Microsoft could have blocked this if they wanted to.
[4356.80 --> 4357.12]  Probably.
[4357.82 --> 4359.22]  I have to imagine that.
[4360.14 --> 4362.24]  Is this, is this just.
[4362.24 --> 4365.36]  Oh, was Windows loader ever on your computer at any point in time?
[4366.04 --> 4368.24]  Oh, invalidated.
[4368.40 --> 4371.36]  Is this just, is this just a.
[4371.36 --> 4372.62]  I think they're just going to eat it.
[4372.68 --> 4373.98]  Straight market share play?
[4374.18 --> 4374.32]  Yeah.
[4374.32 --> 4374.92]  And just eat it?
[4375.00 --> 4375.54]  I think so.
[4375.54 --> 4380.62]  Like, are they just taking Apple head on with the whole free OS updates thing?
[4380.98 --> 4381.18]  Yep.
[4381.32 --> 4382.60]  That's super what I think it is.
[4382.64 --> 4390.94]  Because honestly, right now, not to give anyone ideas, but right now, you could go get a plain Windows 7 ISO from anywhere.
[4391.56 --> 4393.58]  Get the thing that does the thing.
[4394.06 --> 4394.82]  Do the thing.
[4395.10 --> 4396.34]  And then upgrade to Windows 10.
[4397.30 --> 4398.14]  And you're good.
[4399.34 --> 4401.66]  I think you can still get reserved.
[4401.66 --> 4402.26]  Don't quote us on this.
[4402.32 --> 4403.38]  We're not piracy experts.
[4403.38 --> 4406.68]  No, that's not what I'm talking about, but you can still get Windows 10 reserves, right?
[4407.22 --> 4407.84]  I think so, yeah.
[4408.00 --> 4408.20]  Yeah.
[4408.28 --> 4411.74]  So if you can, then theoretically nothing has changed and you'd be able to do it.
[4411.88 --> 4413.74]  And they're not actively trying to stop it.
[4413.82 --> 4416.04]  So, like, I think they're just fighting for market share.
[4416.52 --> 4420.30]  Speaking of actively trying to stop things, you want to post this, puppy?
[4420.72 --> 4421.08]  Sure.
[4421.08 --> 4426.04]  This is some terrible, terrible news for our pals over at NVIDIA.
[4426.78 --> 4429.04]  This was the first email I read this morning.
[4429.12 --> 4431.20]  And I was like, I sent a reply right away.
[4431.26 --> 4436.58]  I'm like, so, does my breast sample actually also get covered by this?
[4437.08 --> 4442.86]  And they're like, yes, you also get a new Shield tablet because this is a fire hazard.
[4442.86 --> 4454.62]  And I think the last thing NVIDIA wants is a news story about, like, popular technology journalist, you know, whoever, burned in his sleep or her sleep.
[4455.40 --> 4456.86]  From beloved tablets.
[4456.94 --> 4463.56]  NVIDIA recalled all Shield tablets due to a battery fire hazard.
[4464.68 --> 4465.56]  Uh-oh.
[4466.50 --> 4466.98]  Whoa.
[4467.32 --> 4467.60]  Whoa.
[4468.34 --> 4470.68]  Whoever makes that battery is in a world of hurt.
[4470.68 --> 4472.70]  So, the battery can overheat.
[4472.88 --> 4481.76]  NVIDIA is asking consumers to stop using the recalled tablet except as needed to participate in the recall and to back up their data.
[4482.10 --> 4486.54]  At launch, NVIDIA made a big deal about the extra thermal dissipation in the design.
[4487.12 --> 4490.50]  There is a dedicated website for owners to recall their devices.
[4490.50 --> 4496.44]  They probably are making the big deal about the extra thermal dissipation of the, like, CPU, GPU.
[4496.44 --> 4497.00]  The CPU, yeah.
[4497.00 --> 4497.42]  Stuff.
[4498.12 --> 4498.94]  Not the battery.
[4498.94 --> 4503.06]  I wonder if the summer has anything to do with the timing of this.
[4503.06 --> 4503.52]  Very probably.
[4504.46 --> 4509.68]  That's going to get interesting because every summer we have is like, oh, records broken everywhere again.
[4510.30 --> 4510.58]  Yep.
[4510.92 --> 4511.18]  So.
[4511.40 --> 4515.46]  So it's NVIDIA.com slash support slash tablet recall.
[4515.98 --> 4521.12]  That's where you guys are going to want to go if you have a broken NVIDIA Shield tablet.
[4521.36 --> 4522.82]  YouTube and Google Plus are divorcing.
[4523.98 --> 4524.72]  They're done.
[4524.72 --> 4527.30]  That is such a sensationalist headline for this.
[4527.38 --> 4527.72]  It is.
[4527.76 --> 4528.52]  Are you covering this?
[4528.54 --> 4530.92]  Because I could put the article in front of my face for a change.
[4531.46 --> 4531.90]  Woo!
[4532.30 --> 4533.10]  Look at that, baby.
[4533.42 --> 4534.36]  I don't have a ton to say.
[4534.46 --> 4538.70]  Don't delete your Google Plus account right now because they haven't done it yet.
[4538.84 --> 4541.70]  So if you delete your Google Plus account, your YouTube account is gone.
[4542.18 --> 4543.46]  So don't do that yet.
[4544.14 --> 4544.54]  PSA.
[4544.54 --> 4544.64]  Okay.
[4545.36 --> 4549.28]  Basically, everything has bailed off of Google Plus.
[4549.40 --> 4550.20]  Photos is split.
[4550.42 --> 4551.20]  Others are coming.
[4551.40 --> 4552.22]  YouTube is split.
[4552.74 --> 4554.38]  Nobody's a fan of Google Plus anymore.
[4555.16 --> 4556.50]  YouTube comments and stuff.
[4557.00 --> 4559.50]  Well, none of the Google services are.
[4559.56 --> 4560.30]  Was anyone ever?
[4560.58 --> 4561.48]  Google services were.
[4561.54 --> 4562.20]  Ah, yes.
[4562.20 --> 4566.68]  Your YouTube comments aren't going to show up in your Google Plus profile anymore, which
[4566.68 --> 4569.22]  is awesome because that was super, super dumb.
[4569.84 --> 4571.56]  And Google Plus will stay here.
[4571.70 --> 4576.76]  Just it will be more focused, more useful, more engaging, and no more people will use it.
[4577.50 --> 4577.74]  Yep.
[4577.98 --> 4579.82]  I'm so done with Google Plus now.
[4579.88 --> 4580.06]  Yep.
[4580.06 --> 4585.66]  I would seriously start Periscoping or Snapchatting or both before I would focus any more of my
[4585.66 --> 4586.62]  attention on Google Plus.
[4586.88 --> 4587.00]  Yep.
[4587.00 --> 4592.68]  I mean, I feel bad for the people who like really invested their time in Google Plus because
[4592.68 --> 4594.88]  that, yeah, that did not work.
[4595.04 --> 4595.40]  Nope.
[4595.52 --> 4595.96]  At all.
[4596.46 --> 4596.78]  Yep.
[4597.20 --> 4599.88]  Um, do you want to cover the tour thing?
[4600.78 --> 4603.18]  I didn't see that until I saw it right now.
[4603.18 --> 4603.34]  All right.
[4603.38 --> 4610.68]  Let's talk about it next week because honestly, until literally 5.30 today, I was getting our
[4610.68 --> 4612.02]  storage servers up and running.
[4612.32 --> 4613.18]  So everyone, 4.30.
[4613.26 --> 4613.62]  Thank you.
[4613.70 --> 4614.64]  See, I don't even know what time it is.
[4614.64 --> 4618.34]  Until 4.30 today, I was getting our storage servers up and running.
[4619.26 --> 4620.32]  And, uh...
[4620.32 --> 4620.90]  I got this one.
[4621.00 --> 4621.80]  Yeah, you got this one?
[4621.88 --> 4622.14]  Okay.
[4622.68 --> 4626.82]  And so I literally walked in and I was like, okay, how set up is the WAN show?
[4626.90 --> 4628.92]  And it like still needed a microphone.
[4628.92 --> 4632.98]  And like I told everyone, I was like, yeah, we'll run it off my laptop today.
[4633.00 --> 4633.62]  No big deal.
[4634.06 --> 4636.94]  And like I was using my laptop to configure the servers.
[4637.40 --> 4639.24]  So it was not here.
[4639.56 --> 4640.76]  I love this laptop.
[4640.98 --> 4642.82]  It is working so hard right now.
[4642.90 --> 4643.76]  It's just so loud.
[4643.76 --> 4645.14]  But it is like doing okay.
[4645.30 --> 4646.08]  Like it is loud.
[4646.22 --> 4646.88]  Listen to this, guys.
[4647.44 --> 4651.42]  But like this, it will do this when there's nothing going on.
[4651.88 --> 4652.28]  Sometimes.
[4652.48 --> 4652.76]  You know what?
[4652.80 --> 4653.80]  I figured out what it is.
[4653.80 --> 4654.28]  No.
[4654.46 --> 4659.68]  It's a Windows service that sometimes takes like 15% CPU utilization and then like...
[4659.68 --> 4660.56]  So it'll tweak out.
[4660.56 --> 4668.30]  And so the Blade has a really aggressive fan profile that seems to be based on load rather than thermals.
[4669.08 --> 4670.52]  And I understand...
[4670.52 --> 4672.04]  I guess I can react faster that way.
[4672.04 --> 4673.78]  I understand why that is.
[4673.78 --> 4676.10]  But that doesn't mean I have to like it.
[4676.10 --> 4676.66]  Yeah.
[4677.66 --> 4678.82]  So it would be nice.
[4679.26 --> 4679.58]  Yeah.
[4679.66 --> 4682.92]  And it keeps the CPU turboing really aggressively, which is great for gaming.
[4683.54 --> 4686.86]  But doesn't always make me super stoked about...
[4686.86 --> 4688.18]  I got it thermal throttle though.
[4688.90 --> 4692.20]  Starcraft 2 on ultra max res.
[4692.36 --> 4694.04]  So running at 3200 by 1800.
[4694.38 --> 4694.60]  Yeah.
[4695.12 --> 4696.30]  Had it working pretty hard.
[4696.30 --> 4700.74]  So what I had to do was I threw in an FPS cap and then I was good.
[4700.90 --> 4701.02]  Cool.
[4701.82 --> 4702.06]  Yeah.
[4702.26 --> 4704.88]  Obama has ordered the world's fastest supercomputer.
[4705.36 --> 4706.14]  Dun, dun, dun.
[4706.14 --> 4706.82]  For 2025.
[4707.58 --> 4708.84]  So like it's going to be a while.
[4709.28 --> 4713.98]  It would be capable of making one quintillion, so a billion billion calculations per second,
[4714.06 --> 4720.16]  also known as one exaflop, to perform complex calculations, aid scientific research, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4720.44 --> 4724.00]  Basically weather data and cancer diagnoses.
[4724.00 --> 4727.44]  Although a lot of people think it's for password cracking.
[4729.68 --> 4733.50]  Well, I guess, you know what?
[4733.64 --> 4738.52]  As much as it's become just an internet punchline, it's going to be as...
[4738.52 --> 4742.08]  For whoever's president in 2025, it'll be as simple as blaming Obama.
[4742.34 --> 4742.60]  Yep.
[4743.14 --> 4746.40]  And with that, we bid you adieu.
[4746.82 --> 4751.10]  Thank you all 10 freaking thousand of you.
[4751.10 --> 4754.42]  That's a considerable amount over 9,000.
[4754.66 --> 4754.98]  Yes.
[4755.44 --> 4758.04]  All 10,000 of you for tuning into the WAN show.
[4758.28 --> 4760.02]  This is a record stream.
[4760.68 --> 4763.58]  And not only that, but a sustained record stream.
[4763.70 --> 4765.02]  You guys are freaking awesome.
[4765.70 --> 4768.22]  Stay tuned for the WAN show next week.
[4768.30 --> 4770.24]  I don't know if we'll be on the actual set.
[4770.54 --> 4771.24]  I doubt it.
[4771.26 --> 4771.76]  I doubt it.
[4771.76 --> 4773.08]  We might be in the library again.
[4773.24 --> 4773.70]  We might be...
[4773.70 --> 4774.16]  Who knows?
[4774.56 --> 4775.74]  But we'll see you again.
[4776.10 --> 4778.02]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4778.60 --> 4780.74]  And thanks for watching, guys.
[4780.74 --> 4804.10]  Landed our call!
[4804.22 --> 4804.48]  Woo!
[4806.90 --> 4807.54]  Okay.
[4807.54 --> 4807.66]  Okay.
