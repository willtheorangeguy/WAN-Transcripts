[0.00 --> 4.32]  Are we live?
[5.58 --> 9.62]  Oh, I was looking at the wrong thing.
[9.98 --> 12.52]  I was like, there's no frames encoded yet.
[13.54 --> 14.02]  Oh.
[14.22 --> 15.26]  We couldn't be live yet.
[15.38 --> 16.04]  No, but there are.
[16.14 --> 16.96]  I was looking at viewers.
[17.40 --> 17.80]  Oh.
[18.22 --> 19.22]  There are no viewers yet.
[19.64 --> 22.92]  Well, also that thing is like either broken or hella delayed.
[22.92 --> 23.32]  Yeah.
[23.42 --> 23.66]  No, no.
[23.72 --> 24.40]  I know that.
[24.52 --> 29.30]  I was seeing that zero value because usually there's that little delay before the frames
[29.30 --> 29.92]  start encoding.
[30.08 --> 35.48]  And I'm like, if I say welcome to the WAN show, then it's going to come across to the
[35.48 --> 35.98]  WAN show.
[36.14 --> 37.96]  Like they're not going to hear the beginning of it.
[38.00 --> 39.72]  But instead I waited too long and I made it awkward.
[40.26 --> 41.14]  Why were we late this time?
[41.82 --> 43.00]  Why were we late this time?
[44.32 --> 45.38]  Well, we were late this time.
[45.38 --> 45.54]  Well, okay.
[45.64 --> 46.58]  Not actually why we were late.
[46.60 --> 47.92]  But what did you do today?
[48.10 --> 48.42]  Okay.
[48.42 --> 49.42]  It's not actually why we were late.
[49.42 --> 51.84]  For the last three hours?
[51.96 --> 52.44]  Two and a half.
[52.50 --> 53.78]  About two and a half hours.
[54.08 --> 56.80]  I have been overhauling the WAN show setup.
[56.80 --> 63.26]  I have reinstalled the audio compressor that we haven't used since way a long time ago.
[63.40 --> 63.82]  Wait, what?
[64.06 --> 64.64]  We can just...
[64.64 --> 65.40]  No, no.
[65.48 --> 67.34]  It's not quite tweaked yet.
[67.40 --> 67.50]  Yeah.
[67.50 --> 68.48]  But it's a lot better.
[68.66 --> 70.74]  So I have reinstalled the audio compressor.
[71.08 --> 73.88]  I have switched to an XLR microphone.
[73.88 --> 76.42]  We do not have a mount for this one yet.
[76.48 --> 77.64]  So I have installed this...
[77.64 --> 78.30]  It's a foamy thing.
[78.30 --> 79.06]  This absolute...
[79.06 --> 80.22]  Here, I'll give you guys a look at it.
[80.22 --> 80.26]  I'll give you guys a look at it.
[80.26 --> 80.56]  Let's see it.
[80.64 --> 80.80]  Yeah.
[81.20 --> 83.78]  This absolutely gorgeous shock mount.
[84.22 --> 84.40]  Yeah.
[84.80 --> 85.70]  Piece of foam.
[85.84 --> 85.96]  Yeah.
[86.32 --> 87.38]  What else did I do?
[87.62 --> 89.04]  I'm sure I did other things.
[89.32 --> 90.68]  There was a platform swap.
[90.90 --> 94.00]  There was some good things done in terms of the audio setup.
[94.08 --> 95.68]  I tried some different capture cards.
[96.56 --> 98.22]  Mostly I was playing around with audio.
[98.48 --> 100.18]  So there you go.
[100.74 --> 102.38]  People are like, the microphone's terrible.
[102.38 --> 103.90]  I know for a fact it isn't.
[104.12 --> 105.42]  And that's another thing I did today.
[105.96 --> 108.88]  Is I actually listened to the stream and tested it.
[108.98 --> 110.18]  So screw you guys.
[110.22 --> 110.40]  Yep.
[110.46 --> 111.12]  So get wrecked.
[111.70 --> 112.72]  Get wrecked, dogs.
[113.00 --> 115.84]  Screw a relatively small portion of you guys.
[116.02 --> 117.00]  And the rest of you are great.
[117.14 --> 117.30]  Yeah.
[117.36 --> 118.38]  The rest of you are awesome.
[118.58 --> 119.32]  But it's just...
[119.32 --> 119.96]  Thanks for watching.
[120.14 --> 121.06]  It's the...
[121.06 --> 122.56]  All right.
[122.62 --> 124.44]  So we've got a great show for you guys today.
[124.68 --> 124.86]  Yeah.
[126.00 --> 127.44]  There is...
[127.44 --> 128.18]  It's official.
[128.50 --> 130.50]  A modular smartwatch.
[131.64 --> 132.24]  Kind of.
[132.38 --> 132.72]  Kind of.
[132.80 --> 133.42]  There isn't one.
[133.52 --> 133.70]  No.
[134.02 --> 135.26]  But there might be one.
[135.32 --> 136.22]  There could be one.
[136.56 --> 137.24]  There could be one.
[137.64 --> 143.74]  The PlayStation 4 has been revealed to be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 games.
[143.84 --> 145.42]  But there's more to the story than that.
[145.92 --> 146.86]  AMD could...
[146.86 --> 147.16]  Could.
[147.16 --> 148.80]  Be profitable in two years.
[149.12 --> 149.36]  Could.
[149.50 --> 149.78]  Could.
[149.98 --> 150.18]  Could.
[150.78 --> 154.38]  And also, Samsung is making a smart flip phone.
[154.46 --> 155.32]  And finally...
[155.32 --> 155.70]  They're doing that.
[155.70 --> 159.42]  My fingernails could all fall off right now.
[162.02 --> 163.00]  But they didn't.
[163.38 --> 163.94]  But they didn't.
[163.96 --> 164.62]  But they could have.
[164.84 --> 165.54]  But they could have.
[165.76 --> 166.80]  That was a potential.
[166.80 --> 167.06]  What a...
[167.14 --> 167.78]  musste.
[172.34 --> 173.02]  They could have...
[173.08 --> 173.62]  It was real.
[174.22 --> 175.06]  It's cool.
[175.22 --> 175.56] 磋.
[175.56 --> 200.76]  And I remembered.
[201.20 --> 201.88]  Oh.
[202.06 --> 203.48]  I put the intro back today.
[203.60 --> 204.24]  Very nice.
[204.24 --> 204.74]  Very nice.
[204.74 --> 211.84]  Why don't we just kind of get the show started this week with a thing that's completely not on the schedule at all.
[212.02 --> 214.40]  That sounds about right. That's usually what we do.
[214.46 --> 215.44]  That is usually what we do.
[215.44 --> 224.80]  Okay, so I had a lot of people calling bullshit on this post that I made on Instagram,
[225.58 --> 228.56]  where I put a GTX.
[228.70 --> 233.50]  There's a lot of people declaring this to be video card X, Y, or Z,
[233.50 --> 235.80]  when actually almost no one got it right.
[236.22 --> 238.06]  It is a GTX 980.
[238.42 --> 241.84]  Okay, so I put a GTX 980 on this setup,
[241.84 --> 246.50]  and I declared it to be a cheap 8-core gaming setup.
[246.72 --> 249.46]  So this video is actually coming out on,
[250.12 --> 255.38]  I want to say Monday morning, Sunday night.
[255.46 --> 257.46]  So midnight Pacific on Sunday.
[257.64 --> 258.80]  It's pretty freaking sick.
[259.22 --> 260.84]  And no lies.
[261.76 --> 262.78]  There is no nonsense.
[262.78 --> 264.54]  I am not pulling your guys' legs.
[265.06 --> 269.68]  Eight Intel processing cores, 16 gigs of RAM, and a motherboard.
[269.80 --> 271.92]  We're talking under $150 US.
[272.54 --> 274.94]  We're talking with a GTX 980.
[275.10 --> 277.76]  And yes, I understand that a GTX 980 is expensive.
[277.88 --> 278.76]  It's not the point.
[279.04 --> 283.82]  The point of putting the 980 in there was demonstrating that this gaming platform
[283.82 --> 290.40]  is not a substantial bottleneck, even for a high-end graphics card.
[290.54 --> 290.74]  Okay?
[290.96 --> 292.96]  So we're talking like now...
[292.96 --> 294.04]  Oh, no, no.
[294.08 --> 295.16]  That was the comparison one.
[295.20 --> 299.00]  We're talking about 75 FPS in Battlefront.
[299.38 --> 299.68]  Okay?
[300.10 --> 301.94]  Star Wars Battlefront, 75 FPS.
[302.20 --> 302.72]  What settings?
[302.72 --> 304.04]  Butter Smooth Ultimate.
[304.60 --> 305.00]  Boom!
[306.16 --> 307.42]  Or Ultra, or whatever they call it.
[307.44 --> 308.20]  Whatever the top one is.
[308.22 --> 309.48]  The highest tier preset.
[309.70 --> 309.72]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[309.72 --> 310.44]  I got you.
[310.44 --> 311.68]  1080p, 75 FPS.
[312.94 --> 313.28]  Yeah.
[313.70 --> 314.30]  That's right.
[314.30 --> 316.70]  So stay tuned for that.
[316.74 --> 318.08]  That's going to be freaking awesome.
[318.54 --> 322.92]  I'm just trying to think if there's any other internal, like, LMG stuff we've had going
[322.92 --> 323.36]  on this week.
[323.40 --> 325.46]  It's been kind of a crazy week, but I don't know why.
[325.46 --> 326.46]  Well, we can't...
[327.46 --> 328.76]  No, that was last week.
[328.90 --> 330.36]  We can't talk about that, but that was last week.
[330.46 --> 331.46]  This week...
[332.00 --> 332.54]  Top secret.
[333.02 --> 333.94]  I did a lot of prepping.
[334.52 --> 334.88]  Prepping.
[334.98 --> 335.70]  Yeah, we prepared.
[336.10 --> 336.88]  This week we prepared.
[337.32 --> 339.46]  Actually, I've been getting a lot of help...
[339.46 --> 341.62]  I did that thing, but I can't.
[341.96 --> 342.30]  Oh, yeah.
[342.36 --> 343.32]  More security stuff.
[343.32 --> 344.98]  So, sort of.
[345.42 --> 347.14]  We actually added a new member.
[347.94 --> 348.10]  Yeah.
[348.48 --> 348.74]  Yep.
[348.82 --> 354.44]  So we have, like, a new sort of, sort of, like, maintenance guy.
[355.10 --> 359.42]  But I'm going to wait until after his probation period in order to, you know...
[359.42 --> 360.48]  Standard procedure, whatever.
[360.82 --> 362.40]  Standard operating procedure, introduce him to...
[362.40 --> 363.10]  Oh, yeah.
[363.20 --> 364.32]  We added another new member.
[364.42 --> 365.36]  That happened this week.
[365.88 --> 367.10]  So it's official.
[367.60 --> 368.42]  Oh, well...
[368.42 --> 373.02]  My wife will be joining us here at Linus Media Group starting in the new year.
[373.32 --> 379.90]  To be fair, she has basically already done enough work to be an employee and, like, kind
[379.90 --> 380.94]  of really is already.
[381.48 --> 385.30]  She's just going to, like, physically be in the office now, which is way better.
[385.38 --> 387.28]  And she won't have to do her other job anymore.
[387.40 --> 387.66]  Yes.
[387.70 --> 388.98]  Which is also way better.
[388.98 --> 389.20]  Yeah.
[389.20 --> 391.96]  So, and, you know, it's really funny.
[392.24 --> 397.20]  One of the things that she stressed out about was that the...
[397.20 --> 397.90]  Okay.
[398.02 --> 405.92]  First, I mean, she's sometimes emotions, you know, take precedent over rational thought.
[406.56 --> 407.60]  She doesn't watch my own show.
[407.98 --> 408.04]  She's pretty rational.
[408.04 --> 409.42]  She is, but...
[409.42 --> 410.04]  Like...
[410.56 --> 411.04]  She's...
[411.64 --> 412.02]  Yeah.
[412.14 --> 414.58]  She still has two X chromosomes, okay?
[414.92 --> 415.20]  So...
[415.20 --> 415.48]  Whoa.
[417.10 --> 417.82]  I'm just saying...
[417.82 --> 420.88]  I went to the H.R. McMillan Space Center...
[420.88 --> 421.16]  Yes.
[421.16 --> 425.24]  ...on my birthday and met many incredibly intelligent...
[425.24 --> 426.54]  That's nothing to do with intelligence.
[427.10 --> 428.62]  My wife is incredibly intelligent.
[428.62 --> 429.52]  Very rational, people.
[429.52 --> 430.60]  And she's very rational.
[430.86 --> 431.12]  Okay.
[431.26 --> 435.24]  But that doesn't mean that sometimes she doesn't...
[435.24 --> 435.86]  Well, okay.
[435.94 --> 446.86]  Anyway, the point is, her first concern was that LMG employees would feel like I was only hiring her because nepotism.
[447.00 --> 447.16]  No.
[447.38 --> 448.42]  And she's my wife.
[448.54 --> 448.86]  No.
[449.46 --> 449.80]  Okay?
[450.20 --> 457.02]  And I was like, my dear, I love you dearly, but that is the single most ridiculous thing you've ever said to me.
[457.02 --> 460.32]  So, stop.
[460.60 --> 465.36]  I think that might, like, she got, like, the second dopest office in the whole thing.
[466.22 --> 468.20]  There's, like, probably part of it has to do with that.
[468.58 --> 468.86]  Yeah.
[468.86 --> 469.78]  At least a small degree.
[469.86 --> 470.34]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[470.34 --> 472.74]  Like, the reason why she's coming, no.
[472.96 --> 473.82]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[473.86 --> 477.14]  Or, like, even if part of it is that she earned her way through other things.
[477.14 --> 482.40]  She even needs the privacy in the office because she's the only one of us that actually does, like, accounting and stuff.
[483.74 --> 484.06]  Yeah.
[484.36 --> 484.88]  So...
[484.88 --> 488.24]  Some of the things that I do should probably not be done.
[488.32 --> 489.06]  That's true, too.
[489.44 --> 489.66]  Okay.
[490.08 --> 490.46]  But...
[490.46 --> 491.40]  But, like, yeah.
[491.62 --> 492.56]  More, much more.
[492.70 --> 497.76]  But anyway, so next, so the next thing was, everyone's like, Linus is so sexist.
[497.80 --> 500.46]  It's like, okay, okay, okay.
[500.52 --> 506.16]  I'm not gonna get, I'm not gonna get too deep into this because, quite frankly, who could handle that?
[506.62 --> 507.88]  Well, apparently...
[509.08 --> 509.42]  Oh.
[509.42 --> 510.24]  Okay, anyway.
[510.78 --> 511.14]  Yeah!
[511.74 --> 512.70]  I'm not gonna get...
[512.70 --> 513.04]  Yes!
[513.14 --> 516.76]  I'm not gonna get too deep into this, but men and women are different.
[518.20 --> 519.22]  They're not the same.
[519.34 --> 519.80]  They're different.
[520.48 --> 521.10]  And that's okay.
[521.66 --> 530.60]  All right, so anyway, the next thing she was worried about was that the viewers would think that the only reason she was involved was because she was, like, the boss's wife.
[531.14 --> 533.34]  And I was like, no, I'm gonna clear that up.
[533.52 --> 534.54]  I'm gonna make sure they know.
[534.54 --> 536.96]  So I'm addressing it on WAN Show once and for all.
[537.82 --> 543.38]  Yvonne has been an integral part of Linus Media Group since before its incorporation date.
[543.62 --> 552.82]  She helped me start the company from, like, day negative, you know, like, 90 when I was working on this for, like, months before we actually kicked off.
[552.82 --> 563.66]  And she has been deeply involved, not just in, like, you know, creating people's paychecks and depositing things in the bank and all those things that she does to help everything run smoothly here.
[563.84 --> 565.62]  Core decisions on direction and stuff like that.
[565.64 --> 579.22]  But she has also been deeply involved in many core decisions involving HR, involving our hiring, involving our content, involving our overall strategy, involving the way that we address things publicly, like our PR.
[579.22 --> 582.10]  So she's very much a part of what we do.
[582.66 --> 583.84]  And she's approved.
[583.96 --> 592.14]  And, like, if people are worried about content control and stuff, she's approved stuff that was, like, we were pretty unsure about it.
[592.20 --> 592.46]  Yeah.
[592.74 --> 595.00]  And she was like, yeah, I mean, you can probably do it.
[595.06 --> 597.86]  We ran How to Hide Your Porn after, Pastor.
[598.28 --> 600.56]  We had, like, a little mini conference call thing.
[600.76 --> 600.98]  Yep.
[601.32 --> 605.64]  And she was like, it's sketchy, but yeah.
[606.06 --> 606.72]  And we were like, okay.
[607.22 --> 607.58]  All right.
[607.58 --> 610.98]  Well, I think I have – that's great.
[611.04 --> 612.06]  Yvonne of the Yukon.
[612.70 --> 615.72]  She hates that reference.
[616.34 --> 626.28]  So what I would recommend is whenever she shows up in a channel super fun or whatever else because she thinks she's not going to be in videos, but I straight up told her that's not going to happen or is going to happen.
[626.76 --> 630.72]  Whatever the part where she is going to be in videos is, that will happen.
[631.18 --> 635.38]  So make sure you leave some comments about Yvonne of the Yukon under the video.
[635.38 --> 635.60]  Yeah.
[635.60 --> 636.68]  She'll love that.
[637.16 --> 639.20]  Well, mostly I'll love teasing her about that.
[639.38 --> 641.00]  And then, you know, it'll be good.
[641.16 --> 641.46]  It'll be good.
[641.84 --> 641.94]  Yeah.
[642.62 --> 644.84]  Got people asking if she'll be hosting anything.
[645.14 --> 646.60]  No, I don't think so.
[646.60 --> 647.28]  I doubt that.
[647.48 --> 648.44]  Not really her shtick.
[648.76 --> 650.50]  I mean, she's actually –
[650.50 --> 652.12]  I expect she'd probably be on channel super fun.
[652.12 --> 653.12]  Yeah, yeah.
[653.28 --> 654.78]  I'd expect her to show up on super fun.
[654.90 --> 663.32]  Like, we'll definitely pull some kind of – actually, we have to haze her when she first starts.
[663.86 --> 667.38]  Like, we have to pull some kind of, like, initiation prank on her.
[667.58 --> 667.90]  What?
[668.10 --> 669.22]  In, like, her first week.
[669.68 --> 671.14]  Oh, like, channel super fun stuff.
[671.26 --> 671.58]  Yeah.
[671.76 --> 673.50]  Okay, I was like, what are you talking about?
[673.66 --> 675.02]  No, no, no.
[675.14 --> 675.44]  We should –
[675.44 --> 678.46]  You get tied to a pole for a day because we're a frat party.
[679.60 --> 680.00]  No.
[680.56 --> 682.02]  That's why I'm like, what are you talking about?
[682.02 --> 682.78]  Not at work.
[685.58 --> 688.22]  That's not even what I meant this time.
[688.30 --> 689.10]  That's not what I meant.
[689.50 --> 691.02]  Anyways, yeah, no, that sounds good.
[691.06 --> 692.10]  We have to think of something cool, though.
[692.16 --> 692.60]  Yeah, yeah.
[692.66 --> 694.08]  We'll have to come up with something cool.
[694.24 --> 695.40]  Like, there's the classics.
[695.58 --> 699.20]  There's, like, putting the noise maker above the ceiling tile in the office or whatever.
[699.20 --> 703.38]  But I want to come up with something a little bit better than that.
[703.64 --> 705.24]  I think we can do that.
[705.58 --> 705.94]  All right.
[705.94 --> 710.46]  So I think that's pretty much it for, like, the Linus Media Group catch-up.
[710.54 --> 716.64]  So why don't we jump right into NVIDIA unveiling their Pascal architecture somewhat.
[717.06 --> 717.52]  Kind of.
[718.10 --> 718.26]  Yeah.
[718.40 --> 719.82]  Somewhat, sort of.
[720.00 --> 725.46]  So at the Japanese edition of NVIDIA GTC, the GPU technology conference, they've unveiled
[725.46 --> 729.44]  some details about their 2016 graphics architecture codename Pascal.
[729.44 --> 730.86]  Oh, the name of this team is The After Party.
[731.06 --> 731.42]  I'm sorry?
[732.36 --> 732.90]  Oh, really?
[733.14 --> 733.58]  I think so.
[734.04 --> 734.62]  Oh, derp.
[734.62 --> 735.44]  That's what it shows online.
[735.44 --> 735.90]  Oh.
[736.82 --> 738.20]  Well, that's not right.
[738.86 --> 740.24]  The WAN show.
[742.46 --> 750.64]  Tech and, whoops, gaming talk Fridays at 1630 Pacific-ish.
[751.48 --> 752.32]  There we go.
[752.40 --> 752.66]  All right.
[752.70 --> 753.18]  We fixed that.
[754.18 --> 754.58]  Okay.
[754.58 --> 759.46]  So basically there's, I mean, there's not a whole lot here that we didn't kind of see coming.
[759.46 --> 763.34]  Up to 16 gigabytes of HBM memory.
[763.58 --> 767.70]  Is what it's going to be launching with, but it can support up to 32.
[768.28 --> 768.58]  Yes.
[768.58 --> 772.62]  So we're talking one terabyte per second in bandwidth.
[772.62 --> 775.42]  Although, and this will be HBM 2, by the way.
[775.42 --> 780.24]  So NVIDIA apparently just kind of went, yep, we're going to sit out this first generation.
[780.58 --> 785.56]  We're going to wait until there's a die shrink, and then we are going to pack as many more
[785.56 --> 787.38]  transistors as we can into our GPU.
[787.38 --> 793.40]  And we're going to go HBM at the same time and deliver, hopefully, something really, really
[793.40 --> 794.04]  groundbreaking.
[795.84 --> 799.32]  Which the GPU market kind of needs, to be completely honest.
[799.32 --> 802.06]  Because with VR around the corner, they're going to be really far behind.
[802.06 --> 809.06]  And it has been, we have been stuck at the same manufacturing process node for so long.
[809.92 --> 811.52]  It's a problem, actually, right now.
[811.54 --> 812.48]  It's been awful.
[812.72 --> 815.46]  Like, they have had to do so many crazy tricks.
[815.58 --> 822.32]  Both NVIDIA and AMD have been, like, tricking all over the, or, okay, that came across wrong.
[823.26 --> 826.78]  Well, clever chip design.
[826.88 --> 827.72]  Why don't we call it that?
[827.72 --> 833.10]  But they have also revealed that Pascal will be available in multi-GPU packaging.
[833.74 --> 838.66]  NV Link is going to enable up to 80 gigabyte per second communication.
[839.66 --> 845.50]  They're going to have higher performance through the use of, oh, man, why am I having trouble
[845.50 --> 846.20]  talking today?
[846.22 --> 848.24]  There's HBM2, which will help from performance.
[848.38 --> 850.60]  There's also a manufacturing node shrink that he's talking about.
[850.70 --> 855.34]  16 nanometer FinFET process, which is still going to be done by TSMC.
[856.90 --> 857.30]  Yeah.
[857.30 --> 860.04]  Yeah, and we're expecting it sometime in the first half of 2016.
[860.26 --> 861.08]  So it shouldn't be that long.
[861.16 --> 861.68]  Stay tuned.
[861.76 --> 863.32]  I wonder what they're going to call the new Titan.
[863.82 --> 866.38]  Because X and Z are the only really cool letters.
[867.42 --> 867.94]  Titan Y?
[868.82 --> 869.26]  No.
[870.08 --> 871.22]  Titan Y.
[871.44 --> 874.12]  Titan Y are you so expensive?
[874.40 --> 875.62]  What if it's, like, Titan H?
[877.38 --> 877.78]  Yeah.
[878.46 --> 880.30]  But the H looks like a very, like, structurally...
[880.30 --> 880.94]  Dropping the H bombs.
[881.76 --> 882.20]  Wow.
[882.72 --> 885.30]  Very structurally sound, like...
[885.92 --> 887.16]  I don't know.
[887.16 --> 888.36]  So what, it looks like an I-beam?
[888.72 --> 889.08]  Yeah.
[893.98 --> 895.94]  Why don't they just call it the Titan Triangle, then?
[895.96 --> 896.44]  Is this the third...
[896.44 --> 897.94]  It's the strongest shape!
[898.16 --> 900.12]  Because Titan, Titan Black, and...
[900.12 --> 903.02]  Well, the Titan Z was the dual GPU one.
[903.16 --> 903.62]  Oh, Z.
[903.78 --> 903.96]  Damn.
[903.96 --> 909.64]  I was going to say, because if this was the third one, they could do Titan 3, and then that would fit with the 3D transistors.
[911.74 --> 912.18]  I...
[912.18 --> 912.74]  I...
[912.74 --> 913.62]  But it's not.
[914.12 --> 914.42]  Ooh.
[914.66 --> 915.74]  So, I don't know.
[915.74 --> 916.48]  All right.
[916.48 --> 916.52]  All right.
[916.56 --> 917.58]  So, this is kind of cool.
[917.76 --> 920.10]  Original article here is from Ars Technica.
[920.46 --> 921.24]  Here we go.
[921.68 --> 932.20]  For a few truly bad DMCA takedowns, YouTube is offering to cover legal costs to protect some video makers who lean on fair use.
[932.20 --> 942.08]  So, one of the examples of fair use would be things like reviews, where you'll be using clips of, you know, Hollywood movies or AAA games.
[942.18 --> 944.54]  Things that would normally be...
[944.54 --> 946.14]  Well, I guess games to a lesser extent.
[946.22 --> 948.92]  But would normally be, you know, very protected.
[949.04 --> 952.04]  No unauthorized reproduction of the blah, blah, blah, etc.
[952.36 --> 954.34]  Fines in jail time, etc.
[954.34 --> 964.72]  But for the sake of critique, you know, this is how channels that do movie reviews, for example, are able to show what they're actually talking about in the video.
[964.78 --> 965.68]  The point of the video.
[966.06 --> 970.98]  And that's what helps them get around the copyright law.
[971.06 --> 974.50]  The point of the video is not the movie.
[974.70 --> 981.32]  The point of the video is their own content that's illustrated by them pointing at what they're talking about in the movie.
[981.32 --> 992.72]  So, with that said, there have been some issues with...
[992.72 --> 995.00]  Here, there were a couple of examples.
[995.54 --> 997.92]  Total Biscuit, I believe, was one of them.
[998.46 --> 1000.76]  Unfortunately, that didn't make it into...
[1000.76 --> 1000.96]  It is not here.
[1001.18 --> 1003.38]  That unfortunately didn't make it into the notes.
[1004.76 --> 1005.38]  Really?
[1005.38 --> 1013.86]  Okay, well, unfortunately, there have been a couple of situations where folks that feel like they really should be protected by fair use are not being.
[1014.26 --> 1018.14]  And YouTube is offering up to a million dollars to protect them.
[1018.24 --> 1019.88]  So, that's pretty interesting.
[1020.02 --> 1028.20]  And it actually comes on the heels, for me, this news of a really unfortunate situation that we ran into this week.
[1028.20 --> 1036.20]  Where we used a classical piece of music from the YouTube Music Library that was composed over 50...
[1036.76 --> 1037.20]  So, it was...
[1037.88 --> 1040.72]  The original composer died over 50 years ago.
[1041.10 --> 1042.58]  Making it public domain.
[1042.68 --> 1044.24]  Making the actual sheet music itself.
[1044.32 --> 1047.46]  The composition public domain in the U.S. and Canada.
[1047.46 --> 1048.46]  But...
[1048.46 --> 1054.46]  And then the player who actually...
[1054.46 --> 1063.90]  The recorder who went ahead and played the music and then made their recording of it free for commercial use and all that stuff.
[1064.06 --> 1066.54]  And, you know, allowed it to be in the YouTube Music Library.
[1066.86 --> 1069.02]  Said, you know, yep, everything's cool with me.
[1069.02 --> 1074.30]  But, international copyright law, it turns out, is a bit of a bear.
[1074.50 --> 1080.92]  And in Germany, you have to wait until 70 years after the artist passes.
[1081.28 --> 1082.84]  So, it hasn't been 70 years yet.
[1082.90 --> 1086.78]  So, we actually got a letter about a video that we uploaded ages ago.
[1086.86 --> 1088.24]  It's got like a million views now.
[1088.70 --> 1092.02]  We got a letter saying that we owe 4,500 euros...
[1092.64 --> 1093.36]  Oh, my God.
[1093.36 --> 1098.24]  ...as a retroactive worldwide license for this song because they are the rights holder of the sheet music.
[1098.24 --> 1102.48]  Even though in our territory, it is not protected.
[1102.60 --> 1109.58]  Now, this is one of those situations where I really don't think there's going to be a whole lot that's going to come of it.
[1109.68 --> 1115.74]  Because this music has been used an awful lot over a span of a year.
[1115.88 --> 1121.36]  And the fact that they're just sitting on it now, waiting for an opportunity to go after people.
[1121.36 --> 1126.60]  Like, I really don't think they're going to be able to target the potentially tens of thousands of YouTube creators...
[1126.60 --> 1131.70]  ...who have used that particular composition and extract 4,500 euros from all of them.
[1132.38 --> 1135.76]  And there was already a post on Reddit where someone went through the same thing...
[1135.76 --> 1137.56]  ...whose lawyer advised them not to pay.
[1137.56 --> 1139.48]  And eventually, the whole thing went away.
[1140.36 --> 1152.56]  But it really does bring up an excellent point about whose responsibility is what in this whole online content creation thing.
[1152.56 --> 1154.56]  Because if YouTube is providing the music library...
[1154.56 --> 1159.38]  ...which technically they do have a disclaimer on saying, you know, we're not responsible for whatever.
[1161.30 --> 1162.52]  But that opens up...
[1162.52 --> 1165.80]  Like, let's say in all of our 3,000 videos we had used this song...
[1165.80 --> 1169.66]  ...we could potentially owe, you know, whatever that works out to.
[1169.76 --> 1173.06]  So, 4,500 euros times 3,000...
[1173.06 --> 1174.00]  Sorry, I'm not that great at...
[1174.00 --> 1175.10]  This is going to be really brutal.
[1175.10 --> 1178.82]  So, we could owe 13.5 million euros, potentially.
[1179.74 --> 1184.90]  Which, I don't know how much you guys know about how much YouTube channels make...
[1184.90 --> 1187.38]  ...but that sure as heck ain't it.
[1188.24 --> 1189.76]  There's a lot of misconceptions there.
[1190.70 --> 1192.40]  A lot of people think we make way more than we do.
[1192.60 --> 1194.04]  Right. Okay. Well, no.
[1194.52 --> 1198.10]  In the entire time that Linus Media Group has ever existed...
[1198.72 --> 1202.76]  ...and for the foreseeable future, 13.5 million euros will be out of reach.
[1202.76 --> 1203.72]  Way more.
[1203.72 --> 1204.38]  Yeah.
[1205.66 --> 1207.90]  So, yeah.
[1208.04 --> 1208.52]  I mean, I'm not...
[1208.52 --> 1209.56]  I guess I'm just not really...
[1209.56 --> 1211.32]  I'm not really sure where I'm going with this.
[1211.32 --> 1215.38]  Other than to say that I'm glad that at least in these cases...
[1215.38 --> 1217.12]  The first four...
[1217.12 --> 1217.56]  Oh, here we go.
[1217.60 --> 1219.42]  The first four videos in the program...
[1219.42 --> 1220.96]  I was trying to read that.
[1221.12 --> 1223.20]  That was a really confusing little bit.
[1223.32 --> 1224.04]  And I don't get it.
[1224.32 --> 1224.66]  So, one thing...
[1224.66 --> 1225.24]  Here's one...
[1225.24 --> 1225.92]  Sorry, did I say...
[1225.92 --> 1226.40]  Oh, you know what?
[1226.40 --> 1228.84]  I actually don't know if TotalBiscuit was one of them.
[1228.86 --> 1230.02]  I know Jim Sterling was, though.
[1230.34 --> 1231.36]  So, here's one of them.
[1231.36 --> 1233.60]  This video is not available in your country.
[1233.60 --> 1235.52]  If you do a copyright claim, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[1236.00 --> 1237.94]  So, oh, this is a playlist of the four.
[1238.24 --> 1239.10]  So, there's actually...
[1239.10 --> 1239.78]  There's a few here.
[1240.86 --> 1241.22]  Okay.
[1241.50 --> 1242.26]  So, let's go back.
[1242.52 --> 1243.18]  There we go.
[1243.48 --> 1243.92]  No, sorry.
[1244.00 --> 1244.44]  One of them...
[1244.44 --> 1245.20]  Jim Sterling.
[1245.32 --> 1245.96]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[1246.00 --> 1246.70]  I totally screwed up.
[1246.76 --> 1247.54]  I thought it was...
[1247.54 --> 1249.06]  I thought it was TotalBiscuit.
[1249.06 --> 1251.92]  But I think what I did was I read this article and then I watched...
[1251.92 --> 1256.64]  I watched a TotalBiscuit thing about copyright or something along those lines of fair use or whatever else.
[1257.24 --> 1258.56]  Because he has...
[1258.56 --> 1262.34]  He just does such a great job of explaining some of these more complicated things.
[1262.40 --> 1262.64]  He does. Yeah.
[1262.64 --> 1263.14]  Yeah.
[1263.14 --> 1263.54]  Um...
[1263.54 --> 1264.94]  Yeah.
[1265.20 --> 1266.56]  So, they can't...
[1266.56 --> 1274.32]  Basically, they're saying they can't offer legal protection for every creator, but they will resist legally unsupported DMCA takedowns.
[1274.32 --> 1278.74]  Because in the past, it's been as simple as like, um, yeah, that's mine.
[1278.86 --> 1280.66]  So, you know, no.
[1280.66 --> 1288.54]  And it goes down right away without them actually having to provide any proof other than just signing a thing that says, yep, I'm the rights holder.
[1288.66 --> 1293.32]  I mean, I've gone through the process a lot of times and I haven't issued any by mistake.
[1293.56 --> 1297.30]  Like, all of mine are actually content that I own and was...
[1297.30 --> 1299.08]  And were re-uploaded without my approval.
[1299.48 --> 1300.82]  Except by one that accidentally...
[1300.82 --> 1302.24]  Well, we can tell that story after.
[1302.34 --> 1303.40]  That's pretty funny story.
[1304.78 --> 1306.56]  But it's so easy.
[1307.08 --> 1309.52]  All I have to do is go, this is my digital signature.
[1309.52 --> 1310.00]  Yep.
[1310.42 --> 1312.18]  You know, I'm a representative of this.
[1312.26 --> 1312.68]  Blah, blah, blah.
[1312.80 --> 1315.24]  And boom, it goes down usually within a couple hours.
[1316.04 --> 1316.76]  Just like that.
[1317.18 --> 1320.04]  And unfortunately, sometimes the system can work too well.
[1321.78 --> 1323.74]  We got a copyright strike this week.
[1323.78 --> 1325.82]  Actually, there's a lot of stuff that's happened this week.
[1325.88 --> 1326.94]  It's been kind of a crazy week.
[1327.26 --> 1330.44]  We got a copyright strike, which I have never had before.
[1331.02 --> 1338.82]  And it basically disabled a ton of my YouTube creator profile until I went to copyright school.
[1338.82 --> 1340.38]  Which I failed, by the way.
[1341.04 --> 1343.82]  Well, I tried to challenge the test and I got one thing wrong.
[1344.16 --> 1344.46]  Oh.
[1345.60 --> 1348.86]  But what's funny about it is that it gave me access to my control panel anyway.
[1349.90 --> 1354.78]  So I really don't know what the point of copyright school was in that case.
[1354.78 --> 1365.32]  Anyways, so when we dug further into it, so we got a copyright strike because a successful DMCA takedown had been issued for some of our content.
[1366.06 --> 1367.46]  And I was like, what?
[1367.90 --> 1370.68]  And it was like, what was it?
[1370.70 --> 1375.06]  It was one of the Silverstone headphone stand design contest videos.
[1375.40 --> 1377.78]  And I was like, I don't even think there was any music in there.
[1377.78 --> 1380.00]  What is this even about?
[1380.88 --> 1386.98]  And so finally, because my account is so limited and because the video has been pulled down, it's hard to find any information about it.
[1387.00 --> 1388.20]  But I finally got to the right page.
[1389.10 --> 1391.58]  And the claimant was Linus Media Group.
[1394.44 --> 1398.68]  So when I dug into it, the contact email was for Colton.
[1398.68 --> 1400.96]  So I was like, okay.
[1401.54 --> 1406.08]  That guy whose bio on the site says that he's just not as good as Nick.
[1406.30 --> 1407.32]  Not as good as Nick.
[1407.40 --> 1408.08]  Nick Light.
[1408.44 --> 1417.74]  So apparently he's not as good as Nick at filing takedowns because he managed to do a takedown on our own damn video.
[1418.64 --> 1419.46]  Which, okay.
[1419.54 --> 1426.76]  And this was after I had sent a super irate email to YouTube being like, hey, yo, I need my account back right away.
[1426.76 --> 1428.46]  We've got uploads to do and stuff.
[1428.88 --> 1433.28]  And they're just like, um, it was issued by you.
[1433.38 --> 1435.24]  Have you tried retracting the takedown?
[1436.30 --> 1438.06]  No, I will look into that.
[1438.56 --> 1439.04]  Colton!
[1441.38 --> 1444.58]  Okay, so he's changed his little blurb now.
[1444.64 --> 1445.44]  So that's a little bit better.
[1445.52 --> 1447.12]  But we might need to add to that.
[1447.32 --> 1449.18]  Also tries to attack own company.
[1449.28 --> 1450.26]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1451.02 --> 1454.92]  Protects the intellectual property of Linus Media Group.
[1454.92 --> 1456.28]  Against Linus Media Group.
[1456.32 --> 1458.10]  To an unprecedented degree.
[1458.68 --> 1462.46]  Oh my goodness.
[1462.66 --> 1463.14]  Oh, man.
[1464.06 --> 1466.14]  Oh, oh, Colton's texting.
[1466.36 --> 1467.10]  Colton's texting.
[1467.44 --> 1467.68]  Yeah.
[1467.90 --> 1468.64]  Colton's texting.
[1468.78 --> 1469.72]  He sent me hashtag wrecked.
[1469.74 --> 1471.16]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1471.34 --> 1472.44]  So it's okay, Colton.
[1472.50 --> 1472.96]  We love you.
[1473.02 --> 1473.66]  We love you dearly.
[1473.72 --> 1476.26]  Although I don't know why you're watching WAN show instead of doing actual work.
[1476.26 --> 1477.16]  Yeah, go back to work!
[1477.16 --> 1478.08]  Yeah, get back to work.
[1478.16 --> 1479.74]  We don't have to yell he's watching the show.
[1480.26 --> 1480.88]  He shouldn't be.
[1481.08 --> 1481.28]  Right.
[1481.96 --> 1482.76]  But he is.
[1482.84 --> 1484.04]  So we don't have to yell.
[1484.16 --> 1484.66]  That's fair.
[1485.16 --> 1486.18]  Go back to work.
[1486.92 --> 1487.36]  Okay.
[1487.84 --> 1489.00]  So this is...
[1489.00 --> 1489.68]  I always...
[1489.68 --> 1490.66]  Oh, I love...
[1490.66 --> 1491.14]  I want to test that.
[1491.26 --> 1493.40]  ...these articles so much.
[1493.40 --> 1497.10]  So this is from Barron's.com.
[1497.50 --> 1498.02]  Ah, yes.
[1498.22 --> 1498.56]  Yes.
[1499.02 --> 1500.10]  Get the full story.
[1500.20 --> 1501.88]  Yeah, I think I can live without the full story.
[1502.84 --> 1506.12]  AMD could be profitable in 24 months.
[1506.88 --> 1508.90]  This is according to JP Morgan.
[1508.90 --> 1517.70]  The chip firm needs to drive share gains and remain disciplined on expenses to reach operating profitability.
[1518.30 --> 1521.00]  And they should probably send samples on time.
[1521.26 --> 1521.78]  Oh, my.
[1521.98 --> 1522.86]  Yeah, that's...
[1522.86 --> 1533.78]  Okay, so you know what's really funny is normally when we're late on a review for like a key launch product, Intel CPU, AMD GPU, NVIDIA GPU.
[1533.78 --> 1539.06]  I was going to say AMD CPU, but that hasn't happened in the entire timeline as media group has existed.
[1541.52 --> 1545.34]  Usually, there's going to be a couple of different camps, right?
[1545.40 --> 1548.88]  There's the camp that's just like, hey, I want to watch the video.
[1549.58 --> 1552.36]  And then there's the camp that's like, hey, you're so biased.
[1552.46 --> 1553.38]  You didn't cover this.
[1554.34 --> 1557.40]  For the 380X, crickets.
[1557.88 --> 1562.20]  I didn't get a single message asking why we didn't review the 380X.
[1562.20 --> 1564.66]  Because literally no one cared.
[1564.82 --> 1566.54]  It seems like a really good value card.
[1566.76 --> 1567.80]  Yeah, it seems all right.
[1567.88 --> 1569.42]  But you know what else was interesting?
[1571.18 --> 1572.82]  Anantek doesn't have a review app.
[1573.44 --> 1573.84]  Whoa.
[1574.14 --> 1574.54]  Yeah.
[1574.74 --> 1576.06]  Don't they have AMD Zone or whatever?
[1576.86 --> 1579.68]  Do they still have the AMD Zone on Anantek.com?
[1579.78 --> 1580.20]  I don't see it.
[1580.20 --> 1580.32]  Is it gone?
[1580.60 --> 1581.38]  Yeah, it's gone.
[1581.48 --> 1581.74]  It's gone.
[1581.82 --> 1582.88]  The AMD Zone is gone.
[1584.02 --> 1584.66]  All right, then.
[1584.76 --> 1584.96]  Yeah.
[1586.00 --> 1586.98]  Wow, Zotac.
[1587.08 --> 1587.88]  That must have cost a fortune.
[1587.88 --> 1590.86]  I was just going to say, that Zotac ad, literally a takeover.
[1590.86 --> 1592.24]  It has an entire takeover.
[1592.36 --> 1595.60]  They've got the top banner spot, left, right banner.
[1596.04 --> 1597.84]  So they've got the background here.
[1598.04 --> 1601.34]  And then they've also got the tower banner above the fold here.
[1601.68 --> 1603.20]  And then poor Corsair.
[1603.36 --> 1603.86]  And the...
[1604.38 --> 1604.70]  Yep.
[1606.08 --> 1606.90]  More down here.
[1607.02 --> 1607.76]  No, no, no.
[1607.84 --> 1608.46]  There's the...
[1608.46 --> 1609.86]  Wow, there's so many ads.
[1611.92 --> 1613.00]  Oh, my God.
[1613.28 --> 1616.68]  I wonder if anyone has ever seen this banner before we did it just now.
[1616.80 --> 1617.44]  Maybe not.
[1617.76 --> 1618.50]  Possibly not.
[1618.50 --> 1620.28]  But yeah.
[1620.72 --> 1623.52]  So I haven't actually talked to Ryan over there.
[1623.68 --> 1627.88]  But my assumption is they probably ran into the same thing we did.
[1628.18 --> 1631.22]  And it's funny because this really never used to happen to us that often.
[1631.22 --> 1633.52]  But it's happened twice in the last little while.
[1634.34 --> 1640.56]  Our 6700K Skylake chip ended up in Peru twice before coming to us two weeks late.
[1640.56 --> 1645.16]  And our 380X arrived a couple of hours before Wensho started today.
[1645.72 --> 1650.24]  So we actually were probably the most on the ball that we had...
[1650.24 --> 1652.72]  This was the most prepared we've been for any GPU video ever.
[1652.86 --> 1653.58]  Ever been.
[1653.92 --> 1654.18]  Okay.
[1654.68 --> 1658.88]  All other cards were already tested using the latest driver.
[1659.08 --> 1660.34]  All of them from the NVIDIA stack.
[1660.44 --> 1661.54]  All of them from AMD stack.
[1661.54 --> 1668.86]  The bench, which we have actually moved to a tower case now so we can do better thermal evaluations.
[1669.18 --> 1669.50]  And better...
[1669.50 --> 1673.90]  Because especially now that cards are going to boost differently depending on whether they're in a case or not.
[1673.92 --> 1673.94]  Yeah.
[1674.00 --> 1674.48]  Really important.
[1674.58 --> 1675.28]  Really important.
[1675.46 --> 1676.46]  So we were like, yeah.
[1676.60 --> 1678.00]  We're like on this.
[1678.12 --> 1678.66]  We're ready.
[1679.08 --> 1680.70]  We're just going to throw that card in there.
[1680.76 --> 1682.18]  We're going to run six benchmarks.
[1682.44 --> 1684.62]  And it's going to be ready to freaking rock.
[1684.62 --> 1685.62]  Nope.
[1686.62 --> 1688.80]  And so we have emails.
[1689.04 --> 1690.86]  Like our email chain with AMD is hilarious.
[1691.34 --> 1693.72]  Because it's like, yeah, your card's shipped.
[1694.26 --> 1696.10]  Yeah, your card should be there by now.
[1696.14 --> 1696.96]  Do you have a tracking number?
[1697.80 --> 1699.70]  Let me look into that and get back to you.
[1700.58 --> 1703.00]  And I'm like, yo, do you have a tracking number?
[1703.50 --> 1705.06]  Oh yeah, your card didn't ship.
[1705.66 --> 1706.66]  I'm like, okay.
[1706.86 --> 1708.40]  So what made you think our card shipped?
[1709.74 --> 1711.36]  Oh, we're going to get one from someone else.
[1711.44 --> 1712.00]  It's here now.
[1712.08 --> 1712.68]  It's here now.
[1712.68 --> 1715.06]  So we're going to hit that early next week.
[1715.06 --> 1715.18]  Live unboxing?
[1715.58 --> 1716.34]  And get that going.
[1716.36 --> 1716.70]  Sure.
[1717.14 --> 1719.58]  We haven't done a live unboxing in a dog's age.
[1719.94 --> 1722.58]  Oh, do you want to grab, do you want to grab, oh, here.
[1722.74 --> 1723.48]  Okay, guys.
[1723.80 --> 1724.00]  Hang on.
[1724.06 --> 1724.88]  Go, go, go, go.
[1725.02 --> 1725.92]  I'll get the other thing.
[1726.32 --> 1728.00]  We'll be right back after these messages.
[1740.00 --> 1740.36]  What?
[1740.68 --> 1740.84]  What?
[1741.16 --> 1741.30]  What?
[1741.30 --> 1745.20]  I don't know where he is.
[1746.82 --> 1747.60]  Let's do this.
[1750.30 --> 1751.94]  Why is there like no one watching?
[1752.26 --> 1753.10]  Did we do something wrong?
[1753.44 --> 1753.74]  Did we?
[1754.04 --> 1755.68]  There's 4,800.
[1756.82 --> 1757.16]  Really?
[1757.16 --> 1759.20]  No, 6,800 according to this.
[1759.28 --> 1760.38]  But no, that's usually not right.
[1760.78 --> 1761.24]  6,800.
[1761.46 --> 1761.80]  Yeah, yeah.
[1761.86 --> 1762.10]  No, no, no.
[1762.10 --> 1762.82]  I'm so terrible.
[1762.88 --> 1763.56]  No, we've got it.
[1763.58 --> 1767.30]  We've got actually a great live audience today in spite of the fact that we've gotten almost
[1767.30 --> 1767.76]  nothing done.
[1767.80 --> 1767.92]  Okay.
[1768.00 --> 1768.22]  No, no.
[1768.22 --> 1768.48]  Hold on.
[1768.54 --> 1768.72]  Hold on.
[1769.00 --> 1769.82]  I went and got a webcam.
[1770.20 --> 1770.68]  Yeah.
[1770.68 --> 1771.52]  Old school.
[1771.52 --> 1772.52]  Yeah, man.
[1772.52 --> 1773.58]  Yeah, man.
[1773.58 --> 1773.68]  Yeah, man.
[1773.68 --> 1777.68]  I hate you.
[1777.68 --> 1777.72]  I hate you.
[1777.72 --> 1779.68]  I hate you.
[1779.68 --> 1781.42]  I hate you.
[1781.42 --> 1782.32]  I hate you.
[1782.40 --> 1783.02]  I hate you.
[1783.02 --> 1785.36]  It's funny because that is old school.
[1785.36 --> 1785.76]  Yeah.
[1785.76 --> 1786.86]  Because we've totally done that.
[1786.86 --> 1786.98]  Yeah.
[1786.98 --> 1787.64]  We've definitely done that.
[1787.64 --> 1788.80]  We have definitely pretended.
[1788.80 --> 1796.64]  We've even done takes in a video where I'll cut the one side and then we'd open it.
[1796.64 --> 1796.76]  Yeah.
[1796.96 --> 1800.10]  And we'd turn it around so we can break the seal on camera again.
[1800.32 --> 1800.50]  Okay.
[1800.56 --> 1800.80]  Hold on.
[1800.82 --> 1801.02]  Hold on.
[1801.04 --> 1803.26]  I've got to get the resolution right here.
[1803.44 --> 1803.64]  Hold on.
[1803.64 --> 1803.86]  Hold on.
[1803.98 --> 1805.16]  I can't turn it around, unfortunately.
[1806.00 --> 1806.20]  Okay.
[1806.34 --> 1809.26]  I'm just going to go for 720p here.
[1810.02 --> 1811.90]  Oh, look at that view of my ugly sweater.
[1812.74 --> 1812.96]  Yeah.
[1813.00 --> 1813.90]  You guys want to look at that?
[1814.08 --> 1814.22]  Oh, yeah.
[1814.22 --> 1814.62]  Mmm.
[1814.80 --> 1815.00]  Mmm.
[1815.00 --> 1819.32]  I feel like we're watching a very different type of content right now.
[1819.38 --> 1819.62]  Yeah.
[1819.86 --> 1820.20]  Okay.
[1820.30 --> 1820.56]  All right.
[1820.60 --> 1820.74]  All right.
[1820.74 --> 1824.24]  We're going to break the seal for definitely the first time ever.
[1824.38 --> 1824.62]  Wow.
[1824.76 --> 1826.36]  That cut so easily.
[1826.66 --> 1826.82]  Oh.
[1828.16 --> 1828.68]  Oh.
[1829.00 --> 1829.66]  It switched over.
[1830.22 --> 1830.62]  Dang.
[1830.86 --> 1831.48]  Dang, nabbit.
[1832.88 --> 1833.40]  Audio.
[1835.30 --> 1835.78]  Yeah.
[1836.68 --> 1836.96]  Nope.
[1837.16 --> 1837.32]  Just.
[1837.70 --> 1838.66]  Oh, camera's worse.
[1838.86 --> 1838.96]  Oh.
[1840.48 --> 1841.00]  Here.
[1841.76 --> 1842.12]  Okay.
[1843.14 --> 1844.32]  Theoretically, that's fixed.
[1844.34 --> 1844.74]  Wait.
[1845.00 --> 1845.56]  No.
[1845.56 --> 1846.00]  Um.
[1846.34 --> 1846.58]  No.
[1846.68 --> 1847.82]  Let's just go for it.
[1847.86 --> 1848.60]  Let's just go for it.
[1848.70 --> 1851.16]  Breaking the seal for the first time for the third time.
[1852.58 --> 1852.94]  Woo.
[1854.28 --> 1855.40]  Aw, yeah.
[1858.56 --> 1859.04]  Okay.
[1859.16 --> 1861.14]  So, we've got some pretty standard packaging here.
[1861.48 --> 1861.74]  Oh.
[1862.50 --> 1862.84]  Oh.
[1863.44 --> 1863.96]  Hold on.
[1864.06 --> 1864.56]  Do you still suck?
[1866.68 --> 1867.16]  Uh.
[1867.58 --> 1868.90]  Apparently not fixed.
[1869.04 --> 1869.26]  Oh.
[1869.36 --> 1869.68]  Okay.
[1869.82 --> 1870.04]  Well.
[1871.06 --> 1871.50]  Um.
[1871.64 --> 1872.54]  Oh, man.
[1872.54 --> 1877.20]  I was so determined to.
[1879.60 --> 1880.04]  There.
[1880.78 --> 1881.76]  How about now?
[1881.86 --> 1882.36]  It shouldn't matter.
[1882.44 --> 1884.22]  You should just change the master source, right?
[1884.56 --> 1885.60]  The master source?
[1885.74 --> 1885.94]  Yeah.
[1885.94 --> 1886.24]  Like.
[1886.24 --> 1886.34]  Oh.
[1887.34 --> 1887.72]  Hold on.
[1889.72 --> 1890.16]  Audio.
[1891.48 --> 1891.88]  Yeah.
[1892.22 --> 1893.00]  Default microphone.
[1893.70 --> 1894.20]  Oh.
[1898.12 --> 1899.10]  There we go.
[1899.22 --> 1899.50]  Okay.
[1899.50 --> 1900.00]  That should be good.
[1900.00 --> 1900.24]  Good work.
[1900.30 --> 1900.46]  Yeah.
[1900.54 --> 1900.72]  Okay.
[1901.38 --> 1901.82]  Okay.
[1902.00 --> 1904.22]  Cutting the seal for the first time for the fourth time.
[1904.34 --> 1904.72]  Yes.
[1905.62 --> 1906.06]  Shrink.
[1906.42 --> 1906.90]  Wow.
[1907.02 --> 1907.16]  Wow.
[1907.16 --> 1908.28]  It's not focusing either.
[1908.40 --> 1908.46]  So wonderful.
[1909.36 --> 1909.98]  Oh, God.
[1910.12 --> 1911.10]  Is it on manual focus?
[1911.60 --> 1912.88]  No, I don't think so.
[1913.10 --> 1913.46]  Okay.
[1914.14 --> 1914.90]  Oh, there we go.
[1915.84 --> 1918.48]  Oh, so we've got some pretty standard brown packaging.
[1918.66 --> 1919.94]  Oh, look at that brown package.
[1919.96 --> 1921.56]  I think that's sapphire's kind of thing.
[1921.74 --> 1922.26]  They do that.
[1922.88 --> 1924.50]  We do have foam, which is good.
[1924.56 --> 1924.80]  All right.
[1924.86 --> 1926.00]  Protective foam for shipping.
[1926.00 --> 1926.60]  Look at the bumps.
[1927.20 --> 1927.48]  Oh.
[1927.92 --> 1929.34]  It's like 100 nipples.
[1930.62 --> 1933.26]  There's a CD, which you should throw away.
[1933.54 --> 1933.90]  Whoa.
[1934.22 --> 1934.54]  Whoa.
[1935.22 --> 1938.08]  There's some packaging stuff, which you probably don't care about.
[1938.60 --> 1939.08]  Whatever.
[1939.32 --> 1940.24]  And then there's the graphics card.
[1940.24 --> 1941.44]  You're making such a mess right now.
[1942.24 --> 1943.86]  I'll deal with it in a moment.
[1944.90 --> 1947.70]  I was even Casey Neistat.
[1947.82 --> 1949.44]  You're making a mess and you're terrible.
[1949.68 --> 1950.62]  Okay, so it's tall.
[1950.92 --> 1951.68]  It's really tall.
[1951.70 --> 1952.36]  Oh, that's interesting.
[1952.52 --> 1953.58]  I don't know if that's standard.
[1953.88 --> 1954.74]  It's the Luke edition.
[1956.00 --> 1957.54]  I don't know if it's supposed to be that tall.
[1957.72 --> 1958.70]  It also has a backplate.
[1958.80 --> 1960.44]  It's tall and it has two fans.
[1962.32 --> 1963.46]  Your mom and your dad.
[1963.72 --> 1963.86]  Yeah.
[1964.00 --> 1964.50]  Get rekt.
[1964.68 --> 1965.22]  You're a dick.
[1966.26 --> 1969.98]  It says on the box with a sticker that it has a backplate included.
[1970.24 --> 1973.66]  So I don't necessarily think that's a standard thing.
[1973.84 --> 1974.12]  Backplate.
[1974.12 --> 1974.36]  Yay.
[1974.56 --> 1977.66]  I don't know if, I don't really think all 280Xs come with a backplate.
[1977.94 --> 1981.40]  I'm also wondering if this is aftermarket so much that it has an extra thing.
[1981.62 --> 1982.52]  Yeah, it seems like it.
[1982.58 --> 1984.38]  Yeah, that's definitely a non-reference.
[1984.46 --> 1986.92]  Although I don't even know if they have a reference PCB for this card.
[1987.00 --> 1987.70]  I have no idea.
[1988.00 --> 1989.34]  Two six pins for power.
[1989.38 --> 1989.72]  Yeah.
[1989.72 --> 1992.46]  No fingers, obviously, because it goes through the board now.
[1992.64 --> 1993.46]  There's a switch.
[1993.54 --> 1995.80]  So I'm assuming there's dual BIOS on this board.
[1995.80 --> 1996.82]  Ooh, a dual BIOS switch.
[1996.82 --> 1997.42]  That's pretty nice.
[1997.60 --> 1998.90]  Got two giant fans.
[1999.14 --> 1999.38]  Yep.
[1999.64 --> 2002.14]  Oh, don't talk about your parents that way.
[2002.66 --> 2004.34]  No, I mean giant as in like effort.
[2005.34 --> 2006.66]  They're trying really hard.
[2006.66 --> 2009.34]  There's, looks like there's four heat pipes.
[2009.88 --> 2010.44]  Four heat pipes.
[2010.60 --> 2012.00]  Yeah, with a copper base plate.
[2012.58 --> 2014.36]  Ooh, maybe a vapor chamber?
[2014.62 --> 2014.84]  Maybe.
[2014.84 --> 2016.26]  No, no, I don't, I'm not sure.
[2016.26 --> 2016.68]  I don't think so.
[2016.80 --> 2017.30]  Hard to say.
[2017.38 --> 2018.50]  They definitely would have said.
[2018.88 --> 2019.14]  Yeah.
[2019.66 --> 2022.96]  10 centimeter fans, dual X cooling, back plate.
[2023.48 --> 2027.52]  Watching someone read off the box really does remind me of the old unboxings.
[2028.46 --> 2029.40]  That's how we did it, man.
[2029.42 --> 2029.90]  So great.
[2030.26 --> 2034.18]  I like that it's not a super complicated, like this would be super easy to take off, which
[2034.18 --> 2034.70]  is kind of cool.
[2034.82 --> 2035.10]  Yeah, okay.
[2035.10 --> 2037.76]  The cooler's pretty thick, but again, I don't think they're all going to come like this.
[2037.76 --> 2038.42]  How heavy is it?
[2041.88 --> 2043.56]  Surprisingly heavy, but not by a ton.
[2043.76 --> 2043.98]  Okay, okay.
[2043.98 --> 2044.78]  Like it's not a brick.
[2044.86 --> 2046.34]  It's got some quality heft to it.
[2046.34 --> 2047.48]  This is the nitro.
[2047.64 --> 2048.08]  The nitro.
[2048.08 --> 2049.32]  So I'm assuming it is a.
[2049.62 --> 2051.32]  It's nitro charged for gamers.
[2051.72 --> 2051.98]  Yeah.
[2052.08 --> 2055.22]  As opposed to being nitro charged for web surfing.
[2055.44 --> 2056.18]  For my fans.
[2056.98 --> 2057.16]  Yeah.
[2057.42 --> 2057.94]  All right.
[2058.04 --> 2058.76]  Well, there you go, guys.
[2058.96 --> 2059.38]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2059.38 --> 2060.12]  Oh, oh, oh.
[2060.14 --> 2062.80]  I.O., we have dual DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort.
[2062.84 --> 2064.56]  I'm not going to pull the things out because I want to keep it nice.
[2064.86 --> 2065.90]  And then, yeah, I think that's it.
[2066.02 --> 2066.38]  Okay.
[2067.04 --> 2067.72]  Well, thank you.
[2067.72 --> 2075.48]  Thank you, Luke, for that live unboxing, which is totally, totally authentically opening it
[2075.48 --> 2076.30]  for the first time.
[2076.46 --> 2076.66]  Yeah.
[2077.12 --> 2077.96]  Only the fourth time.
[2078.10 --> 2079.10]  Yeah, only the fourth time.
[2079.16 --> 2079.30]  Okay.
[2079.62 --> 2082.80]  This is technically signed out under you, so I'm giving that back to you.
[2082.96 --> 2083.20]  Okay.
[2083.52 --> 2083.72]  Yeah.
[2084.00 --> 2086.24]  It's officially not my responsibility anymore.
[2086.36 --> 2086.68]  Wow.
[2088.82 --> 2091.76]  Let's go ahead and move into our.
[2091.76 --> 2092.14]  Oh, right.
[2092.44 --> 2096.20]  Did we ever actually finish that AMD could be profitable in two years topic?
[2096.54 --> 2096.80]  Well.
[2097.40 --> 2097.74]  Okay.
[2097.74 --> 2098.68]  Oh, so here, here.
[2098.80 --> 2099.90]  Well, I guess we'll do it.
[2100.50 --> 2104.38]  So success depends on the company's execution, according to the article.
[2105.00 --> 2107.96]  Which is why we got to the whole idea of us not getting the card on time.
[2108.02 --> 2108.26]  Right.
[2108.66 --> 2113.86]  Success also depends on their time to market and product performance slash power efficiency.
[2114.54 --> 2115.06]  So everything ever.
[2115.06 --> 2116.70]  Who pays these people to be analysts?
[2117.04 --> 2118.12]  Can we be these guys?
[2118.22 --> 2119.38]  I want to be the analysts.
[2119.58 --> 2120.28]  We could do that.
[2120.46 --> 2124.40]  AMD planning stronger professional graphics push in 2016.
[2125.02 --> 2125.42]  Really?
[2125.42 --> 2125.94]  Okay.
[2126.24 --> 2126.60]  Wow.
[2126.76 --> 2130.46]  Just like has been what they've been doing for the last sort of while here.
[2130.50 --> 2131.32]  That's their company.
[2131.52 --> 2134.62]  Expanding into medicine, factory automation, and security.
[2134.92 --> 2135.56]  That's interesting.
[2135.58 --> 2139.78]  Which is just another way of saying GPU processing.
[2140.10 --> 2141.26]  Giant contracts.
[2141.48 --> 2141.74]  Yep.
[2141.86 --> 2142.72]  Because everyone would.
[2143.16 --> 2145.34]  Zen processor speculation.
[2148.22 --> 2148.74]  Okay.
[2149.64 --> 2150.34]  Got it.
[2150.40 --> 2150.84]  Thank you.
[2151.06 --> 2152.08]  This is not an inventory.
[2152.22 --> 2152.70]  I'm going to run back.
[2153.26 --> 2154.24]  Oh, sure.
[2154.24 --> 2155.54]  Thanks, Luke.
[2155.62 --> 2156.28]  I don't want to.
[2156.46 --> 2157.16]  How do you do that?
[2157.48 --> 2163.20]  You know what I should probably do then is why don't I jet through our sponsor stuff here for today?
[2163.64 --> 2167.04]  So our first sponsor is one that we actually haven't.
[2167.30 --> 2170.44]  I feel like we haven't talked about Dollar Shave Club in a long time.
[2170.44 --> 2174.40]  Well, today's first sponsor is Dollar Shave Club.
[2174.48 --> 2179.16]  The service that lets you sign up to get a new razor every month.
[2179.40 --> 2181.22]  Well, not just a new razor.
[2181.36 --> 2188.50]  You actually get like a set of new razor blades so that you can have a nice fresh shave every day.
[2188.84 --> 2189.68]  Yes, every day.
[2189.68 --> 2190.68]  You don't have to be like...
[2190.68 --> 2191.70]  With a knife.
[2191.96 --> 2192.68]  Which would be bad.
[2192.80 --> 2193.70]  Which would be terrible.
[2194.10 --> 2194.32]  Yeah.
[2194.32 --> 2196.16]  Who would shave with a knife?
[2196.50 --> 2197.50]  People without...
[2197.50 --> 2197.96]  I don't know.
[2198.10 --> 2199.96]  Without Dollar Shave Club subscriptions.
[2200.14 --> 2200.46]  All right.
[2200.84 --> 2206.08]  So basically they've got anywhere from a couple bucks a month all the way up to their executive,
[2206.28 --> 2207.96]  which is actually still very affordable.
[2208.14 --> 2210.60]  I think it's like $9 a month or something.
[2210.68 --> 2212.30]  Anyway, I don't remember exactly what the pricing is.
[2212.30 --> 2216.66]  It's available in Canada, the US, Australia, and Australia.
[2216.94 --> 2217.56]  I think is that it?
[2218.28 --> 2218.64]  Wow.
[2218.80 --> 2220.24]  I am just...
[2220.24 --> 2221.80]  What's wrong?
[2221.92 --> 2223.14]  I am not feeling it today.
[2223.34 --> 2224.12]  What are you doing?
[2224.30 --> 2229.10]  But the point is they've got high quality razors and other bathroom supplies.
[2229.30 --> 2232.48]  They deliver them directly to your door for a few bucks a month.
[2232.48 --> 2238.64]  And all you got to do is go to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus and join the club.
[2238.78 --> 2239.36]  Dollar Shave Club.
[2239.36 --> 2242.18]  It's another thing that gives you quality stuff and lets you be lazy.
[2242.48 --> 2242.58]  Yes.
[2242.58 --> 2243.46]  Which I'm super down with.
[2243.48 --> 2246.46]  You don't have to leave the house to look like you leave the house.
[2246.46 --> 2248.06]  Which is helpful.
[2248.22 --> 2249.36]  Which is pretty good.
[2249.42 --> 2250.84]  I mean, sometimes people come over.
[2251.06 --> 2252.56]  I don't really leave the house much.
[2252.76 --> 2253.28]  I know.
[2253.78 --> 2255.32]  You just come here and go home.
[2255.36 --> 2255.64]  Yeah.
[2256.18 --> 2257.30]  I know this to be true.
[2257.32 --> 2258.90]  But I don't necessarily look like that.
[2259.90 --> 2260.46]  Search your feelings.
[2261.14 --> 2262.62]  Open your eyes.
[2262.62 --> 2268.64]  Did you see that sick picture that Brandon posted on Twitter of like the behind the scenes
[2268.64 --> 2270.94]  of that, of the Luke, I'm your father scene?
[2271.46 --> 2272.98]  Like all the lighting and crap.
[2272.98 --> 2275.24]  You know what was the coolest thing about it?
[2275.74 --> 2276.66]  No green screen.
[2277.20 --> 2278.62]  Wasn't there beds or something?
[2278.74 --> 2279.96]  Oh, I'm not sure.
[2280.12 --> 2280.38]  I didn't.
[2280.64 --> 2280.86]  Okay.
[2280.96 --> 2283.04]  I think I've seen a shot of that from a long time ago.
[2283.10 --> 2284.26]  I don't know if it's the one that Brandon posted.
[2284.42 --> 2285.96]  So freaking cool though.
[2286.20 --> 2287.82]  Like it was like really far back.
[2287.90 --> 2290.16]  Like you could see all the lights and crap that they had set up.
[2290.20 --> 2290.84]  It was really cool.
[2290.92 --> 2291.30]  That's cool.
[2291.42 --> 2294.24]  I'm like, you could see all the people standing watching.
[2294.24 --> 2303.74]  Like I have felt really weird at times doing booth coverage, particularly for Asus.
[2304.74 --> 2305.00]  Because.
[2305.20 --> 2305.72]  You know what's weird though?
[2305.76 --> 2305.96]  Okay.
[2306.10 --> 2310.66]  I'm way more comfortable if there's a large group compared to like one or two people.
[2310.98 --> 2311.38]  Really?
[2311.46 --> 2316.02]  If there's one or two people that I know are intently watching, then I'm like, uh, and
[2316.02 --> 2317.22]  I get kind of weird about it.
[2317.30 --> 2320.76]  If there's like a relatively large group of them, then I'm like, okay, whatever.
[2321.48 --> 2321.78]  Really?
[2321.78 --> 2322.50]  I don't know why.
[2323.00 --> 2323.32]  Okay.
[2323.44 --> 2328.94]  Well, what I'll say about booth coverage at Asus is whenever I'm there, like Asus goes
[2328.94 --> 2330.00]  all out at CES.
[2330.44 --> 2332.00]  Like they have, remember.
[2332.20 --> 2334.04]  Oh, because their whole team floats and follows you.
[2334.12 --> 2334.24]  Okay.
[2334.36 --> 2335.32]  That, that is weird.
[2335.42 --> 2335.64]  Okay.
[2335.78 --> 2336.64]  That is weird.
[2336.70 --> 2338.32]  Asus is a huge company.
[2338.74 --> 2344.66]  And so they're going to have like product management teams for every category of products
[2344.66 --> 2345.06]  that they make.
[2345.12 --> 2350.58]  So we're talking optical drives, laptops, bigger laptops, smaller laptops, tablets that turn
[2350.58 --> 2354.24]  into laptops, tablets that don't turn into laptops, smartphones, smartphones that turn
[2354.24 --> 2356.24]  into tablets, smartphones that turn into laptops.
[2356.92 --> 2357.74]  It's endless.
[2357.74 --> 2360.12]  Routers that turn into laptops.
[2360.12 --> 2362.90]  Um, they transform.
[2362.90 --> 2369.46]  And so whenever I'm doing booth coverage at Asus, there's like the North American PR team
[2369.46 --> 2371.24]  that's kind of following me around.
[2371.44 --> 2374.10]  There's the product managed, North American product management team.
[2374.32 --> 2376.12]  There's the Taiwan product management team.
[2376.24 --> 2378.08]  There's the Taiwan marketing people.
[2378.24 --> 2382.66]  There's the, like the salespeople who are just like, Oh, what's this crowd of people following
[2382.66 --> 2384.54]  around this guy who's making videos in the booth.
[2384.54 --> 2389.36]  And it gets to the point where there have been times, um, there was one that really stood
[2389.36 --> 2389.68]  out to me.
[2389.72 --> 2391.48]  It was for like an all-in-one or something.
[2391.66 --> 2391.82]  Yep.
[2392.16 --> 2395.26]  It was for an all-in-one that turned into an Android tablet.
[2395.26 --> 2396.34]  It was a huge one.
[2396.34 --> 2396.58]  Yeah.
[2396.92 --> 2400.98]  There was literally about 10 to 15, maybe was it more?
[2401.24 --> 2402.86]  It was basically everyone there.
[2402.92 --> 2403.56]  It was a lot.
[2403.64 --> 2408.46]  It was like somewhere between 10 and 15 people watching me do my like, like live to tape style
[2408.46 --> 2409.14]  recording video.
[2409.14 --> 2411.62]  And at the end of it, they all applauded.
[2412.06 --> 2412.32]  Yeah.
[2412.78 --> 2418.44]  It was one of the weirdest experiences that I think that I've ever had making a video.
[2418.60 --> 2419.52]  It was pretty weird.
[2419.76 --> 2424.10]  And I make videos with Nick Van Burkle, who apparently needs to talk to me.
[2424.16 --> 2424.70]  Can I help you?
[2425.08 --> 2428.86]  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys that these are illegal in New York streets now.
[2429.16 --> 2429.54]  Really?
[2430.00 --> 2430.34]  Whoa!
[2430.72 --> 2431.68]  For that reason.
[2433.72 --> 2435.60]  Please don't break your neck at the office.
[2436.04 --> 2437.14]  Sorry, New Yorkers.
[2437.24 --> 2439.02]  You can't be scooting around no more.
[2439.98 --> 2440.80]  Only those?
[2440.94 --> 2442.94]  Like our Z boards and stuff still okay?
[2444.10 --> 2444.50]  Really?
[2445.10 --> 2446.06]  Specifically hoverboards?
[2447.28 --> 2447.72]  Interesting.
[2448.34 --> 2448.60]  All right.
[2448.72 --> 2449.98]  Wait, and in the streets?
[2451.28 --> 2453.38]  Like indoors, I'm assuming there's nothing they can do.
[2453.48 --> 2454.78]  Like you can buy them and you can use them.
[2454.78 --> 2455.80]  On the sidewalks, streets.
[2456.24 --> 2456.56]  Huh.
[2456.64 --> 2457.86]  There's just like no skateboarding.
[2458.36 --> 2458.56]  Yeah.
[2458.76 --> 2459.76]  So in much the same way that it's...
[2459.76 --> 2460.44]  So or sidewalks, right?
[2460.56 --> 2460.74]  Yeah.
[2460.74 --> 2461.44]  Like are we talking...
[2461.44 --> 2461.86]  Okay, yeah.
[2461.88 --> 2461.98]  Yeah.
[2461.98 --> 2463.74]  So kind of like no skateboarding on the sidewalk.
[2463.98 --> 2469.86]  No more hoverboarding or self-balancing scooter or like whatever the generic terms are for
[2469.86 --> 2470.00]  them.
[2470.08 --> 2470.84]  That's really interesting.
[2471.20 --> 2477.04]  So I guess our jousting match would not be allowed in New York.
[2477.12 --> 2478.06]  But that's what I'm asking.
[2478.12 --> 2478.94]  That was on a park.
[2479.48 --> 2480.34]  Oh, but that was in a park.
[2480.50 --> 2480.80]  Okay.
[2480.96 --> 2481.24]  Okay.
[2481.46 --> 2481.86]  So as long as we don't...
[2481.86 --> 2483.38]  That wouldn't have been allowed in the street or on the sidewalk.
[2483.46 --> 2487.30]  As long as we don't joust on the sidewalk, which I don't think we would have wanted to
[2487.30 --> 2487.62]  do anyway.
[2487.70 --> 2487.84]  Yeah.
[2488.12 --> 2488.32]  Yeah.
[2488.38 --> 2491.50]  Thank you for contributing a topic to the WAN show for once in your life.
[2491.80 --> 2492.06]  Bye.
[2492.60 --> 2493.14]  Thanks, Burkle.
[2493.64 --> 2500.88]  On the subject of Swagway jousting, actually, it's not very often these days that we kind
[2500.88 --> 2501.76]  of...
[2501.76 --> 2503.20]  Are you going to leak this?
[2503.62 --> 2503.98]  No, no.
[2503.98 --> 2504.28]  Don't worry.
[2504.34 --> 2504.62]  It's okay.
[2505.90 --> 2507.64]  Check this out, my friends.
[2507.74 --> 2515.30]  If you do not already have a Vessel subscription or at least a free trial, Vessel actually put
[2515.30 --> 2520.12]  together like a trailer for our most recent channel, Super Fun.
[2520.14 --> 2520.48]  What?
[2520.72 --> 2522.72]  You guys are going to want to watch this.
[2528.14 --> 2529.54]  Yes, my friends.
[2529.54 --> 2534.46]  Swagway jousting in medieval armor.
[2535.52 --> 2536.24]  Check it out.
[2536.24 --> 2537.48]  That's a pretty legit trailer.
[2537.92 --> 2538.50]  It is.
[2538.54 --> 2539.46]  It is kind of worth it.
[2539.46 --> 2541.74]  I wish they would have used the last hit, but it's okay.
[2541.92 --> 2543.70]  It's okay because they saved the last hit.
[2543.86 --> 2544.26]  Ah.
[2544.36 --> 2544.76]  Yeah.
[2545.04 --> 2545.28]  Yeah.
[2545.76 --> 2547.16]  Saved the best part for last.
[2547.16 --> 2547.52]  That one crunched.
[2547.58 --> 2548.32]  So they...
[2548.32 --> 2548.46]  Yeah.
[2548.70 --> 2549.04]  They...
[2549.04 --> 2549.86]  No sound, apparently.
[2550.14 --> 2550.28]  Yeah.
[2550.32 --> 2550.72]  No, I know.
[2550.92 --> 2551.18]  I know.
[2551.56 --> 2552.18]  So they...
[2552.18 --> 2553.62]  The sound is great, by the way.
[2554.06 --> 2555.70]  Burkle spent so long...
[2555.70 --> 2556.14]  Oh my God.
[2556.20 --> 2556.74]  He was here so late.
[2556.74 --> 2557.46]  ...editing this video.
[2557.46 --> 2560.52]  It's got to be the greatest Channel Super Fun we've ever made, though.
[2560.60 --> 2560.80]  Yeah.
[2561.00 --> 2562.32]  It's absolutely sick.
[2562.62 --> 2564.50]  Everyone's all like, I hate Vessel.
[2564.66 --> 2565.42]  Well, you know what?
[2565.48 --> 2567.86]  Vessel has made a big difference for us this year.
[2567.88 --> 2568.78]  You're actually pretty awesome.
[2568.80 --> 2573.18]  And is a big part of the reason that we can have a person dedicated to Channel Super Fun.
[2573.52 --> 2574.80]  I'll let that sink in for a minute.
[2574.80 --> 2582.02]  We have an employee dedicated to Channel Super Fun that has done like a few thousand dollars
[2582.02 --> 2584.14]  in total sponsorship money ever.
[2584.88 --> 2587.22]  And you can look it up on Social Blade.
[2587.60 --> 2589.28]  Doesn't make a ton on AdSense.
[2589.82 --> 2591.48]  So you guys do the math.
[2592.22 --> 2596.14]  These things help us develop new and better content streams.
[2596.30 --> 2597.00]  So there you go.
[2597.00 --> 2599.62]  I think we talked about this a little bit on the last WAN show.
[2599.68 --> 2600.28]  I don't know, though.
[2600.38 --> 2602.70]  We've shifted to a lot of like crazy cool projects.
[2603.06 --> 2607.04]  Like the thing you leaked at the beginning of the WAN with the eight cores and all that
[2607.04 --> 2607.32]  kind of stuff.
[2607.58 --> 2608.56]  My Fallout build.
[2609.08 --> 2611.16]  The one computer, two gamers.
[2611.36 --> 2613.14]  Like all these crazy build things that we're doing.
[2613.28 --> 2618.38]  We have more employees and extra time and better space and all this kind of stuff to do
[2618.38 --> 2620.50]  that largely, honestly, because of Vessel.
[2620.66 --> 2621.80]  So we're kind of pros with that.
[2621.80 --> 2625.24]  Yep, there's a lot of contributing factors.
[2625.52 --> 2625.88]  Tons.
[2626.26 --> 2626.46]  Oh, yeah.
[2626.46 --> 2629.38]  But I just, I don't want people to kind of go, oh, Vessel's crap.
[2629.44 --> 2629.88]  It's terrible.
[2630.50 --> 2635.22]  It is very helpful if you look at it from the other side of the fence.
[2635.22 --> 2636.34]  The creator side, they're awesome.
[2636.46 --> 2636.60]  Yeah.
[2637.42 --> 2638.68]  People are like, why not Vimeo?
[2638.80 --> 2639.58]  Why Vimeo?
[2639.74 --> 2640.36]  Oh, God.
[2642.98 --> 2645.24]  Okay, so actually we should probably do our other.
[2645.24 --> 2650.92]  Speaking of things that help us keep things going around here, TunnelBear is one of today's
[2650.92 --> 2651.88]  episode sponsors.
[2652.48 --> 2655.68]  The easy to use VPN app for mobile and desktop.
[2656.14 --> 2659.92]  It lets you tunnel in through up to 16 different countries, allowing you to browse the internet
[2659.92 --> 2663.20]  and use online services as though you are in that country.
[2663.36 --> 2664.88]  Tunnel to 16 different countries.
[2664.88 --> 2665.32]  Thank you.
[2665.90 --> 2669.96]  They have apps for iOS, Android, PC, and Mac, and they also have a Chrome extension, so
[2669.96 --> 2671.98]  your bases are pretty much covered.
[2671.98 --> 2675.92]  You just pick your country in the app, turn TunnelBear on, and watch as your bear tunnels.
[2677.60 --> 2679.66]  I'm never going to get tired of that.
[2679.66 --> 2681.02]  Bears don't tunnel.
[2681.82 --> 2683.16]  I love you guys, TunnelBear.
[2683.28 --> 2683.84]  You're cool.
[2684.06 --> 2685.44]  You got a great VPN service.
[2685.52 --> 2685.78]  Okay?
[2686.04 --> 2689.60]  It's free for the first 500 megs, which is super awesome, a month.
[2689.84 --> 2690.74]  They're not like moles.
[2691.08 --> 2692.28]  But bears do not tunnel.
[2693.30 --> 2694.20]  They sleep in caves.
[2694.24 --> 2695.32]  They maybe climb trees.
[2695.54 --> 2695.88]  Okay?
[2696.22 --> 2696.84]  They do that.
[2696.88 --> 2697.66]  If they want something.
[2697.80 --> 2698.70]  Not really heavy ones.
[2698.82 --> 2699.78]  Yeah, if they want something.
[2700.04 --> 2704.36]  With that said, bears are kind of BA, so if they needed something that was underground,
[2704.56 --> 2705.16]  could they tunnel?
[2705.40 --> 2705.80]  Probably.
[2705.80 --> 2705.92]  Probably.
[2706.44 --> 2706.84]  Probably.
[2707.02 --> 2707.98]  I'm sure they can dig.
[2708.08 --> 2709.92]  But their instincts do not drive them to tunnel.
[2710.14 --> 2710.28]  Yeah.
[2710.28 --> 2710.46]  Okay?
[2711.26 --> 2711.86]  And...
[2711.86 --> 2715.34]  I find most large things, their instincts do not drive them to tunnel.
[2716.34 --> 2717.66]  And their...
[2717.66 --> 2720.92]  I can't think of any large animal that tunnels.
[2722.50 --> 2723.52]  Do elephants tunnel?
[2726.14 --> 2726.46]  No.
[2726.58 --> 2727.28]  I knew that.
[2727.44 --> 2727.66]  Okay.
[2728.12 --> 2729.24]  Well, I thought maybe the tusks.
[2729.24 --> 2731.30]  But does that count?
[2731.36 --> 2731.68]  Because...
[2731.68 --> 2731.88]  Okay.
[2732.00 --> 2733.46]  We have to define tunneling.
[2733.84 --> 2734.10]  No, no.
[2734.14 --> 2737.32]  I meant like they could move them like this and make a bore a hole in front of their face.
[2737.42 --> 2738.10]  No, I'm just kidding.
[2738.54 --> 2743.70]  Um, so anyway, your connection gets encrypted with AEX 256-bit encryption.
[2743.70 --> 2749.78]  And if you want to upgrade to unlimited data, you guys can head over to TunnelToBear.com slash
[2749.78 --> 2756.66]  LTT if the first 500 megs is enough to whet your appetite, but not enough for all of your
[2756.66 --> 2758.34]  browsing needs.
[2758.40 --> 2760.12]  Someone said polar bears tunnel in the snow.
[2760.20 --> 2761.06]  Is that tunneling?
[2762.74 --> 2764.34]  It's more like burrowing.
[2764.66 --> 2764.92]  Yeah.
[2765.04 --> 2765.74]  That's what I mean.
[2765.80 --> 2766.98]  Like, what is tunneling?
[2767.04 --> 2769.56]  Because I think tunneling means you're like traveling under the ground.
[2769.74 --> 2770.10]  Yeah.
[2770.10 --> 2771.48]  I'm not sure, though.
[2771.56 --> 2772.10]  I haven't...
[2773.46 --> 2773.88]  All right.
[2773.94 --> 2777.40]  And Nick has given me an updated copy for FreshBooks.
[2777.92 --> 2783.26]  FreshBooks is the easy-to-use invoicing software that helps small businesses look professional
[2783.26 --> 2784.76]  and get paid faster.
[2784.84 --> 2785.62]  And it does do that.
[2786.06 --> 2790.92]  You can try FreshBooks completely free for 30 days at FreshBooks.com slash WAN.
[2791.10 --> 2794.14]  And make sure you type WAN in the How Did You Hear About Us section.
[2794.52 --> 2796.26]  Oh, I don't know if we had that in the...
[2796.26 --> 2802.68]  Anyway, so the point is, if you're like a small computer repair technician or a house
[2802.68 --> 2804.48]  painter, we've got to come up with other examples.
[2804.66 --> 2807.02]  There's like a billion tiny businesses.
[2807.22 --> 2808.02]  If you want to run...
[2808.02 --> 2808.74]  Twitch chat, help me.
[2808.78 --> 2812.82]  If you want to run like an arts instructional thing at your house...
[2812.82 --> 2812.92]  Yes.
[2812.92 --> 2814.46]  And you want to have people come over and stuff, you can build them.
[2814.46 --> 2815.80]  Yeah, or like a small dance studio.
[2815.94 --> 2816.70]  Or a small dance studio.
[2817.04 --> 2818.50]  If you want to...
[2818.50 --> 2820.28]  Lessons of any kind.
[2820.30 --> 2821.28]  Private massage.
[2821.28 --> 2821.72]  Massage.
[2822.92 --> 2823.32]  Yeah.
[2823.44 --> 2827.70]  I mean, you technically could use FreshBooks if you were doing that kind of massages, but...
[2827.70 --> 2832.02]  My mom used to run a thing where she would massage old people at old folks' homes.
[2832.48 --> 2832.74]  Okay.
[2832.92 --> 2833.06]  Yeah.
[2833.10 --> 2835.22]  She could run FreshBooks for invoicing for that.
[2835.32 --> 2835.48]  Yeah.
[2835.52 --> 2836.02]  There you go.
[2836.86 --> 2837.38]  Everyone's...
[2837.38 --> 2839.38]  Everyone's talking about cam girls.
[2840.20 --> 2841.34]  The entire Twitch chat.
[2842.14 --> 2842.56]  Cam girls.
[2842.76 --> 2844.82]  Most of those have pre-done services that they go through.
[2844.96 --> 2845.24]  Yeah.
[2845.42 --> 2845.78]  Okay.
[2845.78 --> 2846.24]  If you want to start your own thing.
[2846.24 --> 2846.80]  But gardening.
[2846.92 --> 2847.24]  Gardening.
[2847.34 --> 2847.82]  There we go.
[2848.02 --> 2848.96]  Gardening's a good one.
[2849.12 --> 2849.42]  Landscaping.
[2849.42 --> 2851.22]  Weed is not a good example.
[2851.48 --> 2851.62]  No.
[2851.64 --> 2852.52]  Unless it's legal.
[2852.74 --> 2853.68]  In which case...
[2853.68 --> 2854.76]  And then that's...
[2854.76 --> 2856.58]  It's probably still a bad example.
[2856.58 --> 2857.10]  Probably a very good example.
[2857.32 --> 2857.52]  Why not?
[2857.54 --> 2857.96]  Well, no.
[2858.04 --> 2859.46]  Because don't you have to...
[2859.46 --> 2860.10]  No, that would work.
[2860.14 --> 2860.34]  Yeah.
[2860.42 --> 2861.14]  That would work pretty darn well.
[2861.14 --> 2861.28]  Yeah.
[2861.28 --> 2862.64]  Because you just have to get...
[2862.64 --> 2865.18]  Most places that I know, there's like crazy government oversight.
[2865.46 --> 2865.58]  Yeah.
[2865.58 --> 2867.40]  But then once you're set up, you could use FreshBooks.
[2867.40 --> 2867.66]  Yeah.
[2867.80 --> 2867.96]  Yeah.
[2868.06 --> 2869.28]  So anyway, there you go, guys.
[2871.12 --> 2877.36]  FreshBooks.com slash when for your small business to get paid on time, track your expenses, track your
[2877.36 --> 2882.44]  hours, and basically just make your life easier so you can spend your time running your business
[2882.44 --> 2887.76]  or enjoying the product you sell, whatever you're into, instead of dinking around in complicated
[2887.76 --> 2888.64]  accounting software.
[2888.80 --> 2890.66]  Someone keeps on spamming about my car.
[2891.40 --> 2891.88]  Your car?
[2892.12 --> 2893.74]  Because I posted the video on...
[2893.74 --> 2895.52]  Oh, yes.
[2895.52 --> 2896.82]  My car is fine.
[2896.82 --> 2897.18]  Okay.
[2897.18 --> 2897.96]  That was from two years ago.
[2897.96 --> 2898.50]  Why don't we...
[2898.50 --> 2899.26]  Let's do the...
[2899.26 --> 2901.70]  Let's show the video so that they have some appropriate context.
[2901.84 --> 2902.14]  I actually...
[2902.14 --> 2903.58]  Have you listened to it with audio?
[2903.82 --> 2904.06]  Mm-hmm.
[2904.22 --> 2904.60]  Because it...
[2904.60 --> 2904.78]  Okay.
[2905.08 --> 2905.26]  Yeah.
[2905.26 --> 2906.20]  Because it's actually hilarious.
[2906.30 --> 2909.14]  Oh, because I should actually...
[2909.14 --> 2911.40]  Stay on this page.
[2911.68 --> 2914.30]  In that case, I should do it here so that they can hear.
[2914.64 --> 2914.92]  Okay.
[2915.44 --> 2915.64]  Yeah.
[2918.30 --> 2919.04]  Is it...
[2919.04 --> 2919.90]  There's no space, right?
[2920.06 --> 2920.76]  No, it's...
[2920.76 --> 2921.52]  That's the...
[2921.52 --> 2921.98]  Oh, wow.
[2922.32 --> 2922.86]  Oh, wow.
[2922.86 --> 2923.78]  Can I leak this?
[2924.56 --> 2925.72]  This is hilarious.
[2926.62 --> 2926.86]  Okay.
[2927.34 --> 2929.04]  I guess I'm doing it.
[2929.22 --> 2930.20]  This is so...
[2930.20 --> 2932.84]  So I accidentally went to the wrong...
[2932.84 --> 2936.36]  The wrong Luke LAFR here on Twitter.
[2936.36 --> 2940.08]  And it turns out that it is indeed the correct Luke LAFR.
[2940.24 --> 2942.50]  But look how young he is in that picture.
[2943.04 --> 2944.42]  He's like a baby.
[2945.36 --> 2946.10]  Look at that.
[2946.20 --> 2948.48]  Like, Luke's kind of baby face as it is.
[2948.52 --> 2949.66]  Especially when he shaves.
[2949.76 --> 2950.54]  But this is some...
[2950.54 --> 2953.78]  That is some next level baby face you got going on there.
[2954.74 --> 2955.04]  Wow.
[2955.04 --> 2957.12]  I love Dropbox because yay!
[2957.24 --> 2957.88]  Free megabytes.
[2958.14 --> 2958.84]  You got some free data.
[2959.06 --> 2960.64]  I was in school and I needed more.
[2960.64 --> 2962.16]  Any chance of a fan meetup?
[2962.40 --> 2962.90]  Day nine?
[2963.10 --> 2964.24]  I'm your biggest fan.
[2964.58 --> 2965.14]  He did.
[2965.26 --> 2966.64]  He did do a fan meetup.
[2966.70 --> 2967.40]  And it was great.
[2967.52 --> 2967.78]  Okay?
[2968.08 --> 2968.88]  It was awesome.
[2968.90 --> 2969.46]  Five tweets.
[2969.56 --> 2970.36]  Where are your other tweets?
[2970.46 --> 2971.12]  Tweets and replies.
[2971.22 --> 2971.74]  Tweets and replies.
[2971.86 --> 2972.06]  Okay.
[2972.82 --> 2973.90]  Oh, wow.
[2974.78 --> 2976.28]  A grammar correction.
[2977.36 --> 2978.50]  What a dick.
[2979.50 --> 2980.56]  What a dick.
[2981.26 --> 2982.22]  What else we got?
[2982.74 --> 2983.66]  I do work.
[2983.66 --> 2986.42]  Literally, I'm at 60 tests per mode now.
[2986.52 --> 2988.18]  I was talking about working for you, actually.
[2988.56 --> 2990.72]  I noticed you have a WordPress site now.
[2991.20 --> 2992.08]  I'm looking for...
[2992.08 --> 2994.02]  If you're looking for free help, I got you, man.
[2994.14 --> 2995.06]  Playing any games?
[2995.30 --> 2996.20]  Who's Poor Habit?
[2996.44 --> 2997.28]  They're a band.
[2998.20 --> 3000.78]  That was a dude I used to play with in WoW
[3000.78 --> 3002.42]  when I used to be really competitive.
[3002.62 --> 3003.78]  Oh, that's great.
[3005.12 --> 3006.60]  That is so funny.
[3006.70 --> 3008.16]  I don't even know if Poor Habit's still around.
[3009.32 --> 3010.12]  They make like...
[3010.12 --> 3013.54]  I really doubt very many people in the audience
[3013.54 --> 3013.98]  would be interested.
[3014.10 --> 3015.76]  It's like super grungy punk music.
[3016.70 --> 3017.02]  Okay.
[3017.26 --> 3018.04]  So hold on.
[3018.14 --> 3018.58]  Here, here, here.
[3020.22 --> 3020.70]  Oh, wait.
[3020.86 --> 3021.22]  Hold on.
[3022.38 --> 3022.74]  Sorry.
[3022.92 --> 3023.36]  I screwed up.
[3029.50 --> 3029.86]  Okay.
[3030.64 --> 3031.04]  Okay.
[3031.08 --> 3031.34]  Hold on.
[3031.40 --> 3032.30]  I have to pause this for a second.
[3033.44 --> 3033.84]  Okay.
[3033.96 --> 3034.56]  Twitch chat.
[3034.80 --> 3035.38]  Twitch chat.
[3036.18 --> 3038.30]  Y'all got to hear me out for a second here, okay?
[3038.70 --> 3043.04]  This video has 1,200 likes and zero dislikes.
[3043.06 --> 3043.50]  I know!
[3043.78 --> 3045.68]  Let's keep it going, okay?
[3045.86 --> 3049.10]  I need all of you to get over there.
[3049.24 --> 3050.10]  Get over there.
[3050.20 --> 3051.58]  Can you post the link in Twitch chat?
[3051.64 --> 3051.80]  Okay.
[3051.80 --> 3052.40]  Post the link in Twitch chat.
[3052.44 --> 3053.72]  I wasn't actually going to shill it.
[3053.72 --> 3056.38]  Get over there and get a like on that video.
[3056.58 --> 3059.26]  Let's try and do something unprecedented, okay?
[3060.02 --> 3062.16]  A video with zero dislikes.
[3062.60 --> 3062.84]  Okay.
[3062.92 --> 3063.80]  So back to the video.
[3063.90 --> 3064.64]  It gets better.
[3064.72 --> 3065.10]  It gets better.
[3065.42 --> 3071.64]  Because what he claims is awesome and never breaks down Pontiac Sunbird.
[3072.48 --> 3074.92]  Sir, that is what you get for owning a Pontiac.
[3075.98 --> 3077.50]  And attempting to...
[3077.50 --> 3078.38]  Someone already wrecked it.
[3079.90 --> 3081.02]  Oh my God.
[3081.80 --> 3082.00]  Yeah.
[3083.38 --> 3083.90]  Dicks.
[3084.62 --> 3085.56]  Like immediately.
[3085.56 --> 3087.16]  I'm the one who's a employee membership.
[3088.04 --> 3091.32]  So that's why I get to enjoy this experience.
[3091.32 --> 3096.02]  See, this is my vehicle that actually doesn't break down.
[3097.56 --> 3098.24]  Oh man.
[3098.66 --> 3101.18]  And this is like...
[3101.18 --> 3102.58]  You still have that bike, right?
[3102.82 --> 3103.26]  Yeah.
[3104.54 --> 3107.42]  You know how many people you've inconvenienced this morning?
[3107.96 --> 3108.34]  Sorry?
[3108.46 --> 3112.14]  You know how many people you've inconvenienced this morning by having a crappy car?
[3112.62 --> 3115.48]  At least I've made it pleasurable by pointing them where to go.
[3116.70 --> 3117.10]  Yeah.
[3117.96 --> 3121.10]  See, CalTire doesn't think much of that.
[3121.10 --> 3121.60]  CalTire.
[3125.22 --> 3126.28]  He honked at me.
[3127.12 --> 3127.54]  He did.
[3128.44 --> 3131.44]  The CalTire thing is like an omen now.
[3131.56 --> 3134.70]  Because that's where we got Nick Van Burkle from.
[3134.86 --> 3135.16]  Yeah.
[3135.32 --> 3135.92]  Oh wow.
[3136.02 --> 3136.74]  CalTire.
[3136.96 --> 3137.24]  Yeah.
[3137.70 --> 3140.54]  So CalTire owed us one for honking at us rudely.
[3140.54 --> 3142.46]  240 dislikes.
[3142.74 --> 3143.50]  What the shit?
[3144.10 --> 3145.36]  Way to go, guys.
[3145.38 --> 3146.32]  Oh my god.
[3146.38 --> 3147.20]  Look at the bar.
[3148.28 --> 3148.84]  Wow.
[3149.54 --> 3150.26]  Way to go, guys.
[3150.26 --> 3151.56]  It was going so well.
[3151.72 --> 3154.68]  It had like 1,200 likes and zero dislikes.
[3154.68 --> 3161.06]  And out of all of you who took the time to go to the video, okay?
[3161.06 --> 3166.74]  Only about 800 of you clicked like and 250 of you clicked dislike.
[3166.74 --> 3173.42]  So this tells us once and for all the percentage of Twitch chat that is pure troll.
[3173.56 --> 3174.78]  It's pretty high.
[3174.82 --> 3176.22]  To the core, okay?
[3177.24 --> 3178.62]  It was pure troll.
[3178.78 --> 3183.24]  I was so happy with that too because it actually had zero and was like pretty high.
[3183.44 --> 3184.64]  And I was like, that's pretty cool.
[3185.52 --> 3186.44]  Oh man.
[3186.44 --> 3187.86]  Well, I'm sorry.
[3188.02 --> 3189.76]  I wrecked it by trying to help.
[3190.04 --> 3191.80]  That's what happened here.
[3192.52 --> 3195.30]  The thing is too, right when you said it, I was like, that's cool.
[3195.38 --> 3196.30]  Oh god, no it's not.
[3196.66 --> 3198.66]  I'm still going to get wrecked.
[3200.74 --> 3202.16]  There is still time.
[3202.16 --> 3209.10]  There is still time for you to find the good in you and go back and like it.
[3209.86 --> 3210.92]  There is still time.
[3211.76 --> 3215.16]  Your 240 souls can still be saved, okay?
[3215.16 --> 3217.72]  Come back from the troll.
[3219.90 --> 3221.30]  All right, what else we got here?
[3221.50 --> 3222.02]  This is great.
[3222.34 --> 3229.46]  So former Apple designers say that Apple has lost the fundamental principles of good design.
[3229.64 --> 3232.82]  I don't know how else to wreck a company more than that.
[3233.46 --> 3236.44]  Yeah, and there's some pretty good points here.
[3236.64 --> 3239.20]  So this is coming from Apple's first interface designer.
[3239.80 --> 3244.86]  And the thing that you could kind of say is, well, okay, a lot has changed since the Apple poo.
[3244.86 --> 3245.98]  You need to be able to do more.
[3246.06 --> 3247.42]  Yeah, and you need to be able to do more.
[3247.42 --> 3266.52]  And more purchase decisions are made these days based on how a device looks, whether it's rose gold or space gray versus what specs does it have and how many lines of code can it show on the screen and one color green or whatever.
[3266.52 --> 3268.10]  Like the world has changed.
[3268.22 --> 3273.56]  But the fundamentals of good design don't necessarily go away.
[3273.98 --> 3277.00]  And there are some very legitimate criticisms here.
[3277.20 --> 3281.44]  So they criticized Apple for having no universal back or undo button.
[3281.84 --> 3285.52]  This is something that I have been hating on for so long.
[3285.52 --> 3286.04]  Long.
[3286.32 --> 3288.34]  And I'll hear people say, well, no.
[3288.74 --> 3294.44]  And one of the things I complain about is most of the time, according to Apple's guidelines, it's in the top left.
[3294.66 --> 3296.10]  And I said, well, hold on a second.
[3296.26 --> 3300.74]  Apple still hasn't fixed this crap even though they've got big phones that you can't reach with on hand anymore.
[3300.94 --> 3303.66]  And people are like, no, because you can swipe from the left.
[3304.82 --> 3305.30]  Sometimes.
[3306.08 --> 3306.88]  Usually even.
[3307.64 --> 3308.34]  Not always.
[3308.34 --> 3311.46]  And inconsistencies, that's a huge problem.
[3311.58 --> 3312.44]  Huge problem.
[3312.46 --> 3317.58]  You need to have the UI work the same way kind of all the time or else that's not good.
[3317.66 --> 3321.98]  Another one is what they call hidden gesture based menus.
[3322.26 --> 3326.14]  And I know that there are freaks on earth.
[3326.64 --> 3327.46]  You heard me, Taryn.
[3327.88 --> 3338.32]  Freaks who can have literally 30 macro buttons on their computers and have multiple profiles of different sets of macros.
[3338.34 --> 3340.98]  And can actually use them.
[3341.20 --> 3341.96]  It's insane.
[3342.10 --> 3342.76]  It's amazing.
[3342.86 --> 3343.74]  Like they're not labeled.
[3344.44 --> 3353.42]  But for most people, a lot of the gestures that are showing up in iOS are going to be ones that they're just plain not going to remember exist.
[3353.42 --> 3365.10]  I mean, there's the ones that are really handy, like swipe to search, swipe up for being able to turn on the flashlight or disable Wi-Fi, but for whatever reason, not enable portable hotspot.
[3365.10 --> 3375.02]  But there's ones that are just like, yeah, it's like two fingers to do this and three fingers for that and four fingers for this.
[3375.08 --> 3377.62]  And it's just like, who's going to even use this stuff?
[3377.82 --> 3381.44]  How about you just make that functionality accessible in a way that's actually meaningful to me?
[3381.44 --> 3391.24]  And then the last one is pushing visual simplicity over usability testing in the new human interface guidelines that they're publishing for developers.
[3392.10 --> 3394.76]  To be clear, they're not only criticizing Apple for this.
[3394.82 --> 3396.44]  They're also criticizing Google Maps.
[3396.98 --> 3400.06]  Google Maps used to be so easy to use.
[3400.48 --> 3406.22]  And now, because I don't use it very often, pretty much every time I try to find the satellite view, I can't find it.
[3406.22 --> 3408.20]  For Google Maps?
[3408.22 --> 3408.36]  Yeah.
[3408.72 --> 3411.28]  Just like, where the crap did they put it?
[3412.74 --> 3413.02]  Ah!
[3417.50 --> 3424.16]  Trying to navigate somewhere with someone who uses Apple Maps is actually infuriating.
[3425.20 --> 3427.18]  Because it'll just suck the whole time.
[3427.42 --> 3427.74]  Apple Maps?
[3428.10 --> 3428.36]  Yeah.
[3428.54 --> 3429.26]  I don't mind it.
[3429.38 --> 3429.92]  It's been...
[3429.92 --> 3430.20]  Really?
[3430.20 --> 3436.20]  It at least doesn't take me literally 25 minutes away from where I'm trying to go like Google Maps has done a couple of times.
[3436.34 --> 3436.46]  Really?
[3436.82 --> 3437.12]  Yeah.
[3437.26 --> 3443.18]  When I was shopping for this place, I missed the appointment to see this place the first time.
[3443.60 --> 3450.98]  Because Google Maps took me to some residential area, like, literally way out in, like, 260th Street.
[3451.14 --> 3451.70]  That's brutal.
[3452.06 --> 3454.46]  And it's like, in Europe, I get it.
[3454.52 --> 3454.76]  Okay?
[3454.76 --> 3459.84]  Because in Europe, no offense to Europeans, but the way streets are laid out are ridiculous.
[3460.74 --> 3461.78]  It's just random.
[3461.98 --> 3471.38]  Like, you might as well just, you might as well just, like, you know, take a map of the town, like, shake it, and, like, kick it.
[3471.44 --> 3471.92]  Like a 3D map.
[3471.92 --> 3476.40]  And then, like, take a hat full of, like, random words and dump it on it.
[3476.48 --> 3477.70]  And, like, that's how they're named.
[3479.20 --> 3479.68]  Impossible.
[3480.14 --> 3482.82]  In North America, it's very simple.
[3483.08 --> 3483.36]  Okay?
[3483.52 --> 3484.04]  I'd love to...
[3484.04 --> 3484.24]  Okay.
[3484.24 --> 3489.48]  You got your streets going this way, and they're numbered sequentially for the most part.
[3489.88 --> 3490.58]  And then you got your...
[3490.58 --> 3491.60]  And by city kind of thing.
[3491.80 --> 3493.76]  And then you got your avenues that go this way.
[3493.94 --> 3497.40]  It starts at zero for America and then goes up.
[3498.18 --> 3499.06]  That would be...
[3499.06 --> 3499.30]  Okay.
[3499.60 --> 3500.14]  Very simple.
[3500.28 --> 3500.80]  Not to, like...
[3500.80 --> 3501.22]  It's a grid.
[3501.46 --> 3502.16]  Go off topic.
[3502.24 --> 3503.36]  So you could sanity check.
[3503.44 --> 3508.94]  That's the point I'm trying to make, though, is they could sanity check an address to make sure it makes at least an ounce of sense.
[3509.02 --> 3509.16]  Yeah.
[3509.16 --> 3509.48]  Yeah.
[3509.48 --> 3509.60]  Yeah.
[3509.84 --> 3512.12]  Whereas in Europe, I understand that that's not always possible.
[3513.44 --> 3515.88]  That is the reason why I kind of want to start our skit channel.
[3516.12 --> 3517.50]  Because doing what you...
[3517.50 --> 3520.54]  Like, dressing up in, like, super old-school English clothing...
[3520.54 --> 3520.74]  Right.
[3520.90 --> 3525.70]  And, like, actually, like, shaking the thing and throwing the words in and then, like, making it seem super official.
[3526.04 --> 3530.26]  Like, if we had some, like, naming ceremony or something, that would be hilarious.
[3530.32 --> 3532.44]  I want to do a sketch comedy channel.
[3533.74 --> 3534.52]  I don't...
[3534.52 --> 3537.64]  I can't figure out the economics of it.
[3538.20 --> 3538.52]  And...
[3538.52 --> 3539.92]  And that's, like, a huge problem.
[3539.94 --> 3544.78]  That's a huge problem because we can't just do random things that make us happy, unfortunately.
[3545.14 --> 3546.32]  The world doesn't work that way.
[3546.54 --> 3547.82]  Although Channel Super Fun has...
[3547.82 --> 3548.78]  We do do some of that.
[3548.78 --> 3548.98]  Yeah.
[3549.26 --> 3552.10]  But sketch comedy, like, to do it well.
[3552.44 --> 3553.58]  And I want to do it well.
[3553.72 --> 3553.84]  Yeah.
[3553.84 --> 3561.34]  Like, I want to have, you know, a budget and actors and props and locations and, you know, not the free grade of music.
[3561.34 --> 3565.66]  Like, I want to have, like, good music in it that you'll end up having to pay for.
[3565.66 --> 3574.74]  Like, to do sketch comedy right, we would probably need somewhere in the neighborhood of about a $5,000 budget per sketch to be even decent.
[3575.08 --> 3575.18]  Yeah.
[3576.04 --> 3576.54]  At least.
[3576.54 --> 3580.44]  And that's, like, you guys are probably looking at it going, whoa, you guys are just wasting money or whatever.
[3580.52 --> 3580.92]  No, no, no.
[3581.72 --> 3583.20]  It's called sustainability.
[3583.20 --> 3588.68]  Like, yes, we could make a sketch on our own time on the weekends for very cheaply.
[3589.08 --> 3598.88]  But if it's part of what we're doing as a company and if it's not, if it's part of, like, you know, making the people who help us, the actors who contribute to our production or the camera operators who come in and help us.
[3598.88 --> 3603.06]  Like, part of making sure that they're making a living, you have to pay those people fairly.
[3603.06 --> 3609.28]  And fairly doesn't necessarily mean $15 an hour because, you know, that's the minimum wage plus sum.
[3609.50 --> 3612.86]  Because these people are in a feast and famine industry.
[3613.14 --> 3613.32]  Yeah.
[3613.54 --> 3616.50]  So when there's no work, they're getting paid nothing.
[3616.64 --> 3619.68]  Which means that when they are getting paid, they need to be making, like, a pretty...
[3619.68 --> 3621.64]  So they can kind of stash it for the winter.
[3621.78 --> 3622.22]  That's right.
[3622.34 --> 3622.70]  That's right.
[3622.70 --> 3623.10]  Right.
[3624.74 --> 3627.42]  So people are like, Linus loves to lecture us.
[3628.22 --> 3629.80]  To be fair, he's pretty good at it.
[3629.96 --> 3631.88]  If he was a teacher, I would legitimately listen.
[3632.22 --> 3634.66]  And that's good.
[3634.80 --> 3637.26]  Someone else is like, Linus racism.
[3638.06 --> 3638.26]  What?
[3638.86 --> 3642.34]  Streets being poorly laid out in Europe has nothing to do with racism.
[3642.36 --> 3643.12]  It has to do with...
[3643.12 --> 3644.42]  It has nothing to do with race.
[3644.42 --> 3645.42]  I'm of European descent.
[3646.34 --> 3648.42]  So as far as races go...
[3648.42 --> 3649.02]  Has to do with...
[3649.02 --> 3650.64]  They were set up a really long time ago.
[3650.64 --> 3652.86]  And built upon for way too long.
[3652.94 --> 3653.64]  So now they're a mess.
[3654.06 --> 3654.42]  Exactly.
[3654.62 --> 3656.26]  It has nothing to do with...
[3656.26 --> 3658.84]  And it's, like, incredibly difficult to go back and fix that.
[3658.92 --> 3659.10]  Yes.
[3659.10 --> 3660.02]  Also known as probably impossible.
[3660.22 --> 3660.48]  Yes.
[3661.02 --> 3661.94]  Probably impossible.
[3662.44 --> 3663.36]  Like, what are you going to do?
[3663.44 --> 3664.60]  Like, can you...
[3664.60 --> 3669.60]  You're just going to randomly rename everything all at once and just watch everyone just be in the worst traffic jam in the street?
[3669.60 --> 3672.38]  Even that's impossible, though, because, like, the streets are just, like...
[3672.38 --> 3672.58]  Yeah.
[3673.58 --> 3673.94]  A maze.
[3674.32 --> 3675.60]  Well, because they weren't probably designed.
[3675.60 --> 3677.30]  Like, can you imagine, okay?
[3677.30 --> 3683.22]  Can you imagine, like, you know, someone running for mayor of London or whatever they call that position over there?
[3683.26 --> 3684.08]  I don't know if they call it mayor.
[3684.18 --> 3695.82]  Anyway, my point is, can you imagine their plan being, okay, over the next 20 years, every two years, we're going to level a tenth of the city and put it back together in a sensible manner.
[3697.04 --> 3697.48]  Right?
[3697.48 --> 3698.56]  It's not going to happen.
[3698.56 --> 3699.26]  It's not going to happen.
[3699.66 --> 3700.90]  So, like, I get it.
[3701.38 --> 3701.98]  It's just...
[3701.98 --> 3702.30]  Yeah.
[3702.56 --> 3702.78]  Yeah.
[3703.72 --> 3704.70]  Linus isn't racist.
[3704.86 --> 3705.66]  He's misunderstood.
[3705.66 --> 3705.86]  He's dead.
[3708.62 --> 3709.02]  Yeah.
[3709.22 --> 3709.42]  Sure.
[3709.58 --> 3710.04]  Let's go with that.
[3710.80 --> 3711.78]  All right.
[3712.12 --> 3714.64]  Intel says Moore's Law isn't dead.
[3714.74 --> 3720.00]  Original article here is from VentureBeat and was posted on the forum by Neo Falfa.
[3720.26 --> 3720.48]  Okay.
[3720.60 --> 3728.68]  I'm not saying this exact article is being read on the WAN show, but have we not had an article from Intel with the same title before?
[3728.82 --> 3729.04]  Yes.
[3729.18 --> 3729.92]  Oh, multiple times.
[3730.04 --> 3730.22]  Yeah.
[3730.36 --> 3730.50]  Yeah.
[3730.50 --> 3731.28]  Intel's always saying.
[3731.28 --> 3731.76]  They just always say this.
[3731.76 --> 3731.86]  Yeah.
[3731.86 --> 3733.02]  Well, they wouldn't have...
[3733.02 --> 3733.66]  Like, once a year.
[3733.66 --> 3736.92]  They wouldn't have to if everyone else wasn't running around saying Moore's Law was dead.
[3737.20 --> 3737.38]  Okay.
[3737.42 --> 3737.80]  That's fair.
[3738.28 --> 3738.58]  All right.
[3738.88 --> 3739.16]  All right.
[3739.20 --> 3739.30]  All right.
[3739.30 --> 3741.46]  So Intel gets all defensive and, like, cagey about it.
[3741.46 --> 3742.06]  Good guy.
[3742.24 --> 3742.60]  Stop.
[3743.40 --> 3744.24]  Like, when...
[3744.24 --> 3744.72]  No way.
[3744.72 --> 3752.46]  I visited AMD's SSD thing in Folsom back, like, four years ago or something like that.
[3752.84 --> 3756.72]  And I accidentally walked into a room that had, like...
[3756.72 --> 3760.58]  I think I can talk about it now because their 3D NAND is out.
[3760.94 --> 3763.52]  But this was, like, really early stages.
[3763.68 --> 3766.84]  Like, technical drawings of how their 3D NAND was going to work.
[3767.02 --> 3769.14]  And they were like, you've been in here?
[3769.54 --> 3771.14]  You didn't take any pictures of that whiteboard, right?
[3771.64 --> 3772.22]  I'm like, no.
[3772.32 --> 3773.50]  Like, don't take any pictures of that whiteboard.
[3773.50 --> 3774.56]  And they went over and, like, erased it.
[3774.92 --> 3775.80]  Like, it was, like...
[3775.80 --> 3776.68]  It was, like, a big deal.
[3776.76 --> 3776.94]  Anyway.
[3777.78 --> 3780.44]  So I actually did interviews with some of their engineers.
[3780.64 --> 3781.98]  And I was like, okay.
[3782.10 --> 3790.92]  So the hard drive guys are saying that, you know, Moore's Law and SSDs can't scale in capacity the way that magnetic has.
[3791.08 --> 3792.50]  And they're just like...
[3793.42 --> 3795.78]  We're pretty sure it can.
[3797.14 --> 3798.50]  And I was like, no, but...
[3799.22 --> 3800.40]  We're pretty sure it can.
[3801.28 --> 3803.48]  And I was like, okay, but can you elaborate...
[3803.48 --> 3804.90]  We're pretty sure it can.
[3805.20 --> 3806.02]  But I'm like, okay, fine.
[3806.06 --> 3806.44]  I get it.
[3807.04 --> 3809.18]  You guys are cocky.
[3809.32 --> 3809.94]  I get that.
[3810.10 --> 3810.88]  I respect that.
[3810.92 --> 3811.46]  That's fine.
[3813.38 --> 3815.24]  I never actually pulled up the article here.
[3815.60 --> 3816.84]  I put it in Twitch chat, though.
[3816.94 --> 3817.34]  Good job.
[3817.46 --> 3817.70]  All right.
[3817.94 --> 3819.88]  Intel says, Moore's Law ain't dead yet.
[3819.88 --> 3823.76]  So they figure we're going to make it all the way down to, what was it, like, 7 nan...
[3823.76 --> 3823.96]  Yeah.
[3824.16 --> 3833.94]  So Intel can see its path through 7 nanometer in spite of some difficulties with 14 nanometer that have been fairly well publicized.
[3833.94 --> 3839.68]  So here's a slide that is in extremely low resolution, but hopefully you guys somewhat get the point.
[3840.28 --> 3846.46]  But one thing that is happening for sure is that the cost per millimeter squared is going up.
[3846.46 --> 3855.64]  So even though you're still able to achieve that doubling of how many transistors you can put per millimeter squared, it is getting more expensive.
[3855.64 --> 3868.92]  So don't expect to see, and we've already seen this to a certain extent, don't expect to see that twice as many transistors, like, a capability necessarily turn into chips that are twice as capable.
[3869.40 --> 3874.36]  Because in order to offset the additional cost per millimeter squared, we might end up with smaller chips.
[3875.32 --> 3881.54]  So it's something that, you know, we've already kind of seen happening, but will become more and more of a factor as time goes on.
[3882.18 --> 3883.34]  Excited for graphene.
[3883.82 --> 3884.08]  Okay.
[3884.08 --> 3885.12]  I just dumped that in there.
[3885.12 --> 3889.08]  Someone posted in the chat, can't believe you guys haven't talked about the new Lumia yet.
[3889.36 --> 3891.56]  And I was like, what are you even talking about?
[3891.78 --> 3893.24]  This is from 12 hours ago.
[3893.52 --> 3893.98]  This is?
[3894.94 --> 3896.26]  Oh, no, this is the review.
[3896.42 --> 3897.68]  No, this was announced a while back.
[3897.82 --> 3902.90]  This is the same time as the devices people care about, Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.
[3903.10 --> 3903.28]  Yeah.
[3905.10 --> 3905.50]  Yeah.
[3905.86 --> 3910.00]  I was going to say, for one, I think we covered the rumor, but I guess that was just the announcement, not the rumor.
[3910.80 --> 3912.52]  And it's a Windows phone.
[3912.52 --> 3914.98]  So it's still got Windows on it.
[3915.12 --> 3915.42]  Yeah.
[3917.56 --> 3918.16]  All right.
[3919.20 --> 3919.60]  Cool.
[3920.32 --> 3925.32]  Basically, I like super quickly skimmed through the review, and there was nothing that I didn't expect.
[3926.04 --> 3926.44]  Okay.
[3926.44 --> 3933.48]  Also, I looked up tunneling, and it says dig or force a passage underground or through something.
[3933.54 --> 3934.22]  A passage.
[3934.22 --> 3939.06]  So I don't think a burrow under the snow counts because it's not a passage.
[3939.48 --> 3942.22]  So technically, a tunnel has to go somewhere.
[3942.42 --> 3942.66]  Yeah.
[3942.66 --> 3943.82]  That's interesting.
[3943.82 --> 3944.98]  I actually didn't know that.
[3946.74 --> 3952.08]  So tummy tunnel could still be correct because it goes somewhere.
[3953.52 --> 3954.16]  Tummy tunnel?
[3954.30 --> 3955.20]  Yeah, your tummy tunnel.
[3955.20 --> 3955.46]  I don't even know.
[3955.68 --> 3956.74]  Is that just your belly button?
[3956.74 --> 3957.22]  No.
[3957.22 --> 3958.40]  No, like your intestines.
[3958.72 --> 3959.22]  Your tummy tunnel.
[3959.42 --> 3959.60]  Yeah.
[3959.80 --> 3960.06]  Yeah.
[3960.06 --> 3960.48]  It goes somewhere.
[3960.54 --> 3960.66]  Yeah.
[3960.94 --> 3961.14]  Yeah.
[3961.36 --> 3961.56]  Yeah.
[3961.76 --> 3961.94]  Yeah.
[3962.40 --> 3963.14]  All right.
[3963.60 --> 3969.34]  Speaking of things that no one cared about, we actually, I think we were teasing them about this a little bit when we did the unboxing.
[3969.34 --> 3976.26]  But we should talk about sort of where the R9 380X falls in place within the rest of the gaming landscape.
[3977.36 --> 3979.06]  It's really, this is really funny.
[3979.14 --> 3979.26]  Okay.
[3979.26 --> 3980.74]  I'm going to tell a story that I'm not sure.
[3981.00 --> 3981.40]  Oh, yeah.
[3981.44 --> 3984.62]  I was going to tell a funny story before that I never ended up telling, I don't think.
[3986.22 --> 3986.60]  Oh, yeah.
[3986.60 --> 3987.04]  I don't remember.
[3987.16 --> 3987.38]  Sorry.
[3987.52 --> 3988.32]  I don't know what you're.
[3988.42 --> 3990.96]  You were prompting me to tell it, I think.
[3991.14 --> 3992.02]  It was funny or something.
[3992.02 --> 3992.60]  Oh, crap.
[3992.70 --> 3992.94]  Yeah.
[3993.08 --> 3993.26]  I know.
[3993.50 --> 3993.82]  No.
[3993.96 --> 3994.76]  Wasn't that the Colton thing?
[3995.72 --> 3996.06]  Yes.
[3996.42 --> 3996.72]  Okay.
[3996.72 --> 3996.82]  Okay.
[3996.82 --> 3998.50]  So the R9 380X.
[3998.50 --> 4004.10]  It's really funny because Luke was joking to me when we found out that we weren't going to get the card in time.
[4004.28 --> 4012.94]  So we ended up releasing a moving blog that we've kind of had in the bank for a rainy day for a while instead of our 380X review, which was on the schedule.
[4013.60 --> 4017.06]  He was like, so you know what we could do?
[4017.36 --> 4017.68]  Oh.
[4018.08 --> 4020.86]  Is just test all the rest of the cards.
[4020.86 --> 4024.56]  Look at the MSRP of the R9 380X.
[4024.90 --> 4031.28]  And then just take the price and the prices of the other cards and extrapolate the FPS from there.
[4032.02 --> 4034.68]  And I was like, you're joking, right?
[4034.88 --> 4035.96]  He's like, yes.
[4036.16 --> 4037.00]  I'm like, okay, good.
[4037.00 --> 4040.24]  And I'm like, but that would totally work.
[4041.34 --> 4043.70]  Because, and this has been the conclusion for what?
[4043.76 --> 4045.80]  Like your last eight graphics card reviews?
[4046.02 --> 4046.04]  Oh, yeah.
[4046.04 --> 4047.06]  Like a long time.
[4047.40 --> 4052.80]  I love doing the videos, but like the conclusion is like, yeah, you all knew this.
[4052.86 --> 4054.08]  AMD or NVIDIA.
[4054.28 --> 4059.64]  I think in every single video, it's been a bit like, so the performance is unsurprising, but it slots here.
[4059.64 --> 4062.58]  Like, I seriously think I've said that for like a year now at least.
[4062.86 --> 4068.58]  AMD or NVIDIA looks at the other cards on the market and looks at how theirs performs,
[4068.68 --> 4070.22]  because they're the only ones who know at that point.
[4070.60 --> 4073.36]  And then they price it exactly where it fits.
[4073.68 --> 4076.06]  And that is what the R9 380X is.
[4076.20 --> 4081.28]  It's a compelling value if you wanted to spend $230 US on a graphics card.
[4081.44 --> 4082.04]  Good value card.
[4082.16 --> 4085.30]  If you wanted to spend $200, you could buy the 380.
[4085.72 --> 4089.34]  And if you wanted to spend $250, you could get a 285.
[4089.64 --> 4093.22]  And all of those things would make sense.
[4094.08 --> 4094.32]  Yeah.
[4094.56 --> 4097.36]  There's no like surprises in the graphics industry right now at all.
[4097.50 --> 4097.72]  Yeah.
[4097.88 --> 4098.84]  How much money do you have?
[4098.88 --> 4099.34]  This much.
[4099.40 --> 4099.92]  Pick a team.
[4100.00 --> 4100.40]  There you go.
[4100.48 --> 4100.86]  Good job.
[4100.86 --> 4101.12]  Yeah.
[4101.52 --> 4102.02]  Like, yeah.
[4102.46 --> 4102.76]  Oh.
[4103.38 --> 4110.04]  I'm really hoping that with the die shrink and with HBM, NVIDIA is going to knock my socks off next year.
[4110.64 --> 4111.54]  We need, seriously.
[4112.06 --> 4113.00]  I'm hoping for that.
[4113.00 --> 4115.42]  I went to GDX a little while ago.
[4115.42 --> 4122.40]  NVIDIA announced this like super cool thing that they're working on with a gaming company where they're doing like a climbing Everest simulator.
[4122.72 --> 4122.74]  Yeah.
[4122.74 --> 4123.48]  That looks really cool.
[4123.60 --> 4125.42]  It's badass and awesome.
[4126.22 --> 4126.76]  Good, good, good.
[4127.06 --> 4133.84]  But there was these really interesting panels with some like industry influencers or speculators or developers.
[4133.84 --> 4136.90]  Like the CEO of CCP Games was there.
[4137.14 --> 4141.14]  And CCP Games is making like some of the coolest stuff in VR.
[4142.10 --> 4143.20]  Valkyrie is badass.
[4143.34 --> 4147.06]  They had a game there which was basically the Tron game where you throw discs.
[4148.06 --> 4149.78]  So I got to play that against Colton.
[4149.92 --> 4152.46]  I think I beat him like 20 something to two.
[4152.84 --> 4153.30]  Poor Colton.
[4153.32 --> 4154.32]  So that was fun.
[4154.44 --> 4155.00]  Get wrecked.
[4156.44 --> 4160.74]  But like that was probably the second most fun VR demo I've ever done.
[4160.94 --> 4162.08]  And Valkyrie was the first.
[4162.42 --> 4165.16]  So like CCP is kind of wrecking it right now which is awesome.
[4165.26 --> 4166.20]  I'm totally down for that.
[4166.62 --> 4168.04]  But there's some really cool stuff.
[4168.04 --> 4174.36]  But one thing that was said more than once up on stage was like whoa this is really hard to run.
[4175.06 --> 4175.16]  Yeah.
[4175.58 --> 4178.10]  Like a lot of people were like okay wow.
[4178.48 --> 4180.04]  Yes there will be mobile experiences.
[4180.32 --> 4180.42]  Yeah.
[4180.54 --> 4183.80]  And those will probably be the most of the market which they're probably right.
[4183.96 --> 4188.36]  And they are working on rendering tricks to you know don't render it from that angle.
[4188.58 --> 4188.68]  Yeah.
[4189.02 --> 4191.28]  And pre-D fish eye and all that kind of stuff.
[4191.28 --> 4194.48]  Render just this little bit at full res and render the rest of it at much lower res.
[4195.42 --> 4197.22]  It's still incredibly hard to run.
[4197.22 --> 4199.52]  And the mobile ones are going to be super basic.
[4199.66 --> 4205.26]  There's a CCP game called Gun Jack which is kind of Valkyrie but also kind of not.
[4205.36 --> 4208.90]  Like it's you're in space and you're shooting gun at other spaceships.
[4209.22 --> 4210.92]  But you're in a fixed position.
[4211.44 --> 4212.66]  Everything comes at you.
[4213.12 --> 4213.84]  Oh so it's an asteroid.
[4214.02 --> 4214.38]  I don't.
[4214.58 --> 4214.82]  Yeah.
[4215.14 --> 4216.28]  That sounds badass.
[4216.44 --> 4217.02]  It's modern asteroid.
[4217.16 --> 4221.40]  It's tons of fun but like if you think about Valkyrie compared to that Valkyrie is way more intense.
[4221.62 --> 4221.76]  Right.
[4221.90 --> 4223.86]  So they're going to be way narrowed down when they're mobile.
[4223.86 --> 4229.86]  And when they're on PC you're going to need a beast machine to run these things without getting sick because you need insane FPS.
[4230.30 --> 4230.94]  This is cool.
[4231.26 --> 4231.96]  This is cool.
[4232.12 --> 4237.82]  For the first time SLI might universally make a ton of sense.
[4237.98 --> 4238.00]  Yeah.
[4238.08 --> 4239.66]  VR SLI looks badass.
[4239.92 --> 4240.06]  Yeah.
[4240.06 --> 4246.60]  Because it can render each eye separately as its own low latency path.
[4246.60 --> 4251.04]  I am super stoked on what SLI means for VR performance.
[4251.16 --> 4253.06]  It could be a literal doubling across the board.
[4253.72 --> 4254.30]  Oh yeah that's right.
[4254.36 --> 4255.02]  You do don't you?
[4255.82 --> 4256.24]  Yes.
[4256.68 --> 4257.12]  All right.
[4257.50 --> 4258.50]  Nick insists.
[4258.70 --> 4259.54]  So I'm going to do it.
[4259.62 --> 4261.38]  Nick insists that I bring this up.
[4261.76 --> 4266.60]  The LTT edition Noctua fans are in stock.
[4266.88 --> 4267.10]  Yeah.
[4267.10 --> 4269.96]  You can actually order them and they will ship immediately.
[4270.72 --> 4273.40]  The pre-orders I know people waited longer than they wanted to.
[4273.50 --> 4282.30]  But the good news is my Twitter feed has been absolutely flooded with people talking about how much they love them and showing them installed in their systems.
[4282.66 --> 4283.28]  It's been great.
[4283.40 --> 4285.48]  I haven't gotten a single piece of negative feedback.
[4285.48 --> 4295.70]  I haven't gotten a single person tweeting at me saying it didn't work which is great which is exactly why we partnered with Noctua for this because I did not want to see that kind of stuff.
[4295.82 --> 4297.80]  With that said some of them will fail.
[4298.12 --> 4298.34]  Oh yeah.
[4298.40 --> 4300.00]  Even the best product in the world fails.
[4300.10 --> 4302.62]  We're shipping too many to have I think 100% success.
[4302.64 --> 4303.20]  4,000.
[4303.66 --> 4305.02]  We're shipping 4,000.
[4305.40 --> 4310.06]  So with that said so I got performance PC site up here.
[4310.38 --> 4314.26]  There's 303 NFA 14s left for Americans.
[4314.26 --> 4320.04]  There are 143 NFF 12s left for Americans.
[4321.48 --> 4324.02]  Overclockers.co.uk may be out already.
[4324.78 --> 4329.34]  If they have any it is not very many and probably only 140s.
[4330.36 --> 4335.90]  NCIX still has a fair bit of stock and they ship worldwide but you're going to eat it on the shipping cost.
[4336.04 --> 4339.58]  So if you can find someone closer to you while they still have stock now is the time.
[4339.58 --> 4345.64]  And PLE in Australia still has a few mostly 140s but they do still have some 120s.
[4345.64 --> 4349.62]  So if you guys want them get yours today.
[4349.62 --> 4352.40]  I don't know if we're going to make more.
[4352.48 --> 4353.90]  I legitimately don't know if we're going to make more.
[4354.68 --> 4356.26]  I mean this was something that was really cool.
[4356.80 --> 4358.64]  And like I was really happy to be able to do it.
[4358.72 --> 4362.44]  If we make more are we taking the limited edition sticker off the new ones or no?
[4362.50 --> 4367.12]  No they will still be limited because if we make more that will very likely be the last run.
[4367.18 --> 4367.32]  Okay.
[4367.32 --> 4370.58]  Like they won't last forever that's for sure.
[4370.76 --> 4377.32]  I'm not getting into the business of like selling fans all day and allocating a bunch of our warehouse space to like pallets of fans.
[4377.40 --> 4378.00]  That's not happening.
[4378.52 --> 4382.66]  This is just something that I felt really passionately I wanted to exist.
[4383.20 --> 4390.00]  So I bought 4,000 of them so that I could make sure that we met the minimum order quantity so that they could exist.
[4390.36 --> 4392.28]  And then now that they exist I am content.
[4392.72 --> 4393.48]  They exist now.
[4393.66 --> 4394.64]  I don't need to make more of them.
[4394.64 --> 4399.34]  Also oh right this is huge.
[4399.90 --> 4402.26]  There is a new merch store.
[4402.96 --> 4411.54]  So this link merch.linustechtips.com has always kind of led to a super crappy merch store that's like all out of stock and stuff.
[4411.66 --> 4414.56]  And like overpriced shipping and a lot of other issues.
[4414.56 --> 4422.46]  We have officially partnered with Teespring to bring you guys a fully Teespringed out merch store.
[4422.68 --> 4429.76]  And to celebrate we have brought back almost all of our previous designs.
[4430.12 --> 4434.22]  So now they are not just available in one style or one color.
[4434.22 --> 4439.14]  You can go to any of our designs and you can pick the colors that you want.
[4440.04 --> 4441.14]  See check that out.
[4441.34 --> 4443.80]  You can pick the style that you want.
[4443.88 --> 4448.84]  So you can now get hoodies in some of the styles that never had hoodie designs before.
[4449.08 --> 4451.38]  Like just the plain WAN, stealth shirt.
[4451.38 --> 4456.66]  And if I'm right, not necessarily all of them but a few of the designs that aren't here right now might be coming still.
[4457.22 --> 4458.28]  Like resolution is just a number.
[4458.90 --> 4460.00]  Resolution is just a number.
[4460.08 --> 4463.02]  Has to be retooled to be 10 colors or less.
[4463.90 --> 4468.66]  And BroFist also has to be retooled to reduce the number of colors.
[4468.66 --> 4476.44]  Because we're using a different printing technology here that it can't do more than 10 colors.
[4476.92 --> 4478.48]  So there you go guys.
[4478.70 --> 4480.84]  And there's more to it than that.
[4481.04 --> 4481.76]  This is really cool.
[4481.90 --> 4485.42]  So for the holiday, Nick is literally messaging me about this now.
[4486.12 --> 4487.30]  I'm sure that's what he's doing.
[4488.16 --> 4489.24]  Oh, yeah.
[4489.80 --> 4490.66]  I have good breath.
[4490.82 --> 4491.16]  Oh, okay.
[4491.26 --> 4492.30]  Yeah, no, that's fine Nick.
[4492.30 --> 4498.76]  And stay tuned guys because we are planning to do an offer code for the holiday season.
[4499.52 --> 4504.54]  So that every design is going to be available for a discount for the holiday season.
[4504.68 --> 4505.90]  I don't remember what the offer code is.
[4506.16 --> 4509.28]  But yeah, stay tuned for that guys because it's going to be awesome.
[4512.04 --> 4515.22]  Do we have a final count on the number of episodes for Scrapyard Wars?
[4515.42 --> 4515.84]  Yeah, seven.
[4516.14 --> 4516.34]  Okay.
[4516.34 --> 4520.12]  So this weekend will be the final episode on Vessel.
[4520.36 --> 4522.10]  And then next week will be the final episode on YouTube.
[4522.74 --> 4524.80]  I just, I like, I knew that.
[4524.90 --> 4525.76]  I didn't know if it was public.
[4526.08 --> 4526.28]  Yep.
[4526.54 --> 4527.64]  Well, no, it wasn't.
[4527.74 --> 4528.26]  Now it is.
[4528.32 --> 4528.70]  Now it is.
[4528.78 --> 4528.94]  Cool.
[4529.20 --> 4529.48]  Seven.
[4529.62 --> 4530.52]  Now it is.
[4530.54 --> 4534.90]  Now when I stream, I don't need like literally my entire chat just asking me when Scrapyard Wars
[4534.90 --> 4535.32]  is going to end.
[4535.78 --> 4536.46]  That's awesome.
[4537.62 --> 4538.68]  This is really cool.
[4538.84 --> 4544.22]  Sony enabled PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility sort of without telling anyone.
[4544.22 --> 4546.52]  They have officially announced it now.
[4547.22 --> 4549.88]  But there you go.
[4550.10 --> 4550.66]  That's cool.
[4550.82 --> 4551.12]  Here you go.
[4551.12 --> 4552.52]  Like, update.
[4552.72 --> 4555.86]  A Sony representative sent us the following statement in response to our query about the
[4555.86 --> 4556.66]  emulator's existence.
[4557.16 --> 4561.86]  We are working on utilizing PS2 emulation technology to bring PS2 games forward to the
[4561.86 --> 4562.50]  current generation.
[4562.76 --> 4565.76]  We have nothing further to comment at this point in time.
[4565.76 --> 4567.42]  Not that I would know, obviously.
[4567.58 --> 4569.20]  I would have no idea at all.
[4569.32 --> 4572.40]  But I think PC users have been able to do this for like...
[4572.40 --> 4572.78]  PS2?
[4573.18 --> 4573.38]  Yeah.
[4573.44 --> 4573.78]  Yeah, yeah.
[4573.82 --> 4574.44]  There's PS2 emulators.
[4574.84 --> 4576.04]  Not that we would know.
[4576.26 --> 4576.46]  No.
[4577.16 --> 4579.18]  No, I legitimately haven't run a PS2 emulator.
[4579.28 --> 4579.98]  I have a PS2.
[4579.98 --> 4582.30]  But I know that they exist.
[4582.68 --> 4584.04]  I have run PS1 emulators.
[4584.92 --> 4586.28]  I never owned a PS1.
[4586.64 --> 4587.32]  I'll admit to that.
[4587.38 --> 4590.28]  Well, actually, I did own one, but the optical drive broke and it was out of warranty.
[4590.62 --> 4591.12]  So...
[4591.12 --> 4591.36]  Rip.
[4591.36 --> 4592.26]  I used an emulator.
[4594.04 --> 4594.44]  What?
[4594.56 --> 4596.36]  Aren't we like not supposed to...
[4596.36 --> 4597.26]  Well, I own the game.
[4597.62 --> 4598.52]  Oh, okay.
[4598.60 --> 4599.56]  And I owned a console.
[4600.14 --> 4600.48]  Okay.
[4601.18 --> 4602.50]  Is that actually a thing?
[4602.66 --> 4603.04]  Or is that...
[4603.04 --> 4604.40]  It's not legal.
[4604.80 --> 4605.04]  Okay.
[4605.04 --> 4612.52]  But in much the same way that I can own all the DVDs of South Park and I will stream it
[4612.52 --> 4616.68]  to myself using Air Video, which is technically not allowed in some countries anyway.
[4616.76 --> 4617.70]  I don't even know in Canada.
[4618.00 --> 4620.60]  I don't care because as far as I'm concerned...
[4620.60 --> 4621.28]  You paid for the content?
[4621.38 --> 4622.74]  I paid for that piece of content.
[4622.92 --> 4624.20]  So you guys can just...
[4624.20 --> 4625.06]  I'm down to back that.
[4625.74 --> 4626.10]  Yeah.
[4626.22 --> 4629.42]  So as far as I'm concerned, if I own Final Fantasy Tactics...
[4629.42 --> 4631.04]  I like actually don't emulate things.
[4631.18 --> 4633.70]  So I was trolling a little bit, but like I actually don't.
[4633.70 --> 4637.52]  I have a PS2 and like the games that I wanted to play on PS2, I own.
[4638.36 --> 4639.18]  I don't know why.
[4639.28 --> 4640.98]  I just like playing with the authentic experience.
[4641.16 --> 4644.14]  One of the reasons that I emulate is that I really like save states.
[4645.20 --> 4647.66]  Save states are cool, but that's actually part of it for me.
[4647.66 --> 4651.84]  I want to struggle through it like it was me playing in that day.
[4651.94 --> 4653.32]  No, I'm not that into that.
[4653.40 --> 4660.54]  I mean, like back when like the save point was like this manipulative thing to make you
[4660.54 --> 4661.28]  keep playing.
[4661.50 --> 4662.94]  When it's like realistically, you know what?
[4662.94 --> 4664.06]  My kid's crying right now.
[4664.82 --> 4665.48]  See, that makes sense.
[4665.56 --> 4667.08]  I don't have time for that.
[4667.26 --> 4670.34]  And part of it for me is I want to have a lot on the line.
[4671.30 --> 4674.46]  Because a lot with those games was they're not actually that long.
[4674.46 --> 4677.18]  And part of it's like the accomplishment of getting there is like holy awesome.
[4677.18 --> 4680.88]  Having to sit through the bloody cut scene again if you don't beat the boss this time.
[4680.98 --> 4682.20]  Is a punishment, literally.
[4682.34 --> 4682.78]  Is a punishment.
[4682.84 --> 4685.92]  And that makes it that once you beat him, it's like, yes.
[4686.08 --> 4689.88]  Now to be clear, I ration my use of save states.
[4690.10 --> 4695.14]  I use save states for convenience and for time management.
[4695.44 --> 4696.80]  I do not use them to cheat.
[4697.30 --> 4697.50]  Okay.
[4697.50 --> 4700.96]  So a game like Final Fantasy Tactics is, have you ever played it?
[4701.68 --> 4702.04]  No.
[4702.04 --> 4702.80]  Play it now.
[4703.52 --> 4704.16]  Play it.
[4704.50 --> 4706.30]  Go home and play it.
[4706.38 --> 4706.66]  Okay.
[4706.76 --> 4707.76]  It is great.
[4708.22 --> 4712.64]  I've always, I played a game that was a tactics game that wasn't Final Fantasy and I loved it.
[4712.78 --> 4713.84]  And then everyone was like, play Final Fantasy.
[4714.00 --> 4715.90]  And I just, I don't know why I haven't.
[4716.08 --> 4718.28]  I'm excited to, I want to, I own it.
[4718.44 --> 4718.78]  I just haven't.
[4718.78 --> 4719.32]  Play it now.
[4719.40 --> 4719.54]  Okay.
[4719.60 --> 4722.12]  So anyway, but it's a turn-based, it's a turn-based.
[4722.14 --> 4722.34]  Yeah.
[4722.58 --> 4723.44]  The strategic.
[4723.72 --> 4723.92]  Yeah.
[4724.06 --> 4724.36]  Good game.
[4724.36 --> 4727.98]  So it would be so easy to cheat with save states, but I don't.
[4728.48 --> 4733.00]  I use save states to make sure that I can pause the game when I have to walk away for it for
[4733.00 --> 4733.32]  two days.
[4733.38 --> 4733.90]  See, that's cool.
[4734.12 --> 4734.50]  Yeah, yeah.
[4734.64 --> 4736.00]  Because like, when I was a kid, right?
[4736.18 --> 4739.84]  And I didn't have an emulator and I had a Super Nintendo, I just have to leave my SNES
[4739.84 --> 4742.26]  on for like, you know, a week sometimes.
[4742.38 --> 4742.72]  I've done that.
[4742.76 --> 4743.52]  Of course you have.
[4743.54 --> 4743.76]  Yeah.
[4743.96 --> 4744.44]  We've all done it.
[4744.44 --> 4744.96]  I've done that so many times.
[4744.98 --> 4746.94]  And if the power goes out, it's like, come on.
[4746.98 --> 4747.24]  Yeah.
[4747.50 --> 4747.70]  Yeah.
[4748.04 --> 4748.92]  Come on.
[4748.92 --> 4752.98]  You got to make sure that like where your console is, isn't an enclosed space and it can breathe
[4752.98 --> 4754.24]  or else it'll lake over here.
[4754.24 --> 4754.36]  Yeah.
[4754.40 --> 4754.94]  Twitch chat.
[4755.04 --> 4755.60]  Twitch chat.
[4755.70 --> 4756.12]  Now.
[4756.38 --> 4757.26]  Just do it.
[4757.48 --> 4758.24]  Tactics now.
[4758.26 --> 4758.86]  I saw that.
[4759.08 --> 4759.56]  I saw that.
[4759.98 --> 4760.94]  Great game.
[4761.36 --> 4764.62]  Oh, people are asking how to get the hoodie that we're wearing.
[4764.90 --> 4767.46]  That's teespring.com slash whenchristmas.
[4767.68 --> 4771.40]  So the main store is just for past campaigns.
[4771.54 --> 4774.04]  We're still going to do like limited edition campaigns.
[4774.72 --> 4775.90]  So there you go.
[4776.50 --> 4776.82]  All right.
[4776.82 --> 4777.78]  What else do we have?
[4778.50 --> 4780.96]  What else do we have for this week?
[4780.96 --> 4783.38]  Oh, this is a really cool thing about the PlayStation 2 emulator.
[4783.76 --> 4789.76]  Much like many emulators can do, they are actually taking this opportunity to up sample the games.
[4790.22 --> 4794.84]  So they are running at, looks like 1292 by 896.
[4795.66 --> 4796.24]  Cool stuff.
[4796.92 --> 4798.04]  Apparently runs pretty smoothly.
[4798.54 --> 4801.62]  Only a few titles have been released for backwards compatibility so far.
[4801.62 --> 4804.56]  Like some Star Wars stuff and stuff like that.
[4804.66 --> 4805.96]  That's probably why they haven't announced it yet.
[4806.14 --> 4806.64]  Well, okay.
[4806.74 --> 4809.06]  That's probably why they didn't announce it until now, I guess.
[4809.18 --> 4810.94]  This was posted by Nine Shadow on the forum.
[4811.12 --> 4816.72]  Samsung is bringing back the flip phone with a smart flip phone.
[4816.92 --> 4818.20]  Yes, my friends.
[4818.80 --> 4821.66]  A smart phone flip phone.
[4821.68 --> 4824.98]  To be fair, when we were in Japan, it doesn't really seem like the flip phone is fully dead.
[4825.86 --> 4826.10]  Yeah.
[4826.24 --> 4826.40]  Okay.
[4826.50 --> 4826.84]  Fair enough.
[4826.84 --> 4830.46]  There you go.
[4830.48 --> 4830.78]  Cool.
[4831.10 --> 4831.46]  CPU.
[4832.14 --> 4834.30]  1.8 gigahertz, 1.4 gigahertz, big little.
[4835.46 --> 4836.42]  Well, that's interesting.
[4836.56 --> 4837.84]  768 by 1280.
[4838.16 --> 4840.20]  So they've gone not quite 16 by 9.
[4840.64 --> 4841.82]  Fairly interesting.
[4842.60 --> 4843.80]  Super AMOLED screen.
[4844.26 --> 4844.50]  Okay.
[4844.86 --> 4847.62]  So basically, it's not like a flagship device or anything like that.
[4847.68 --> 4850.24]  But personally, I think there's a value to the flip phone.
[4850.30 --> 4851.84]  It does put the microphone closer to your mouth.
[4851.90 --> 4852.28]  So that's cool.
[4852.34 --> 4854.36]  It has 64 gigs of internal storage.
[4854.88 --> 4855.84]  Oh, no, never mind.
[4855.84 --> 4856.54]  Oh, sorry.
[4856.66 --> 4857.74]  No, no, no, no.
[4857.86 --> 4860.98]  I misinterpreted a couple of things here.
[4861.24 --> 4862.48]  That is a flagship phone.
[4862.56 --> 4868.56]  That's got an Exynos 7420, 3 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of storage, Android 5.1.1 lollipop,
[4868.80 --> 4875.00]  and two 3.9-inch Super AMOLED displays with a 16 megapixel primary camera and a numeric T9 keypad.
[4875.40 --> 4877.78]  This side is in Chinese, and I did not translate it.
[4877.90 --> 4879.84]  But looking at the rating thing at the bottom, it's hilarious.
[4880.16 --> 4883.12]  5 out of 5, 5 out of 5, 4 out of 5, 1 out of 5.
[4883.12 --> 4885.88]  I have no idea what they got wrecked on, but they got wrecked on something.
[4886.02 --> 4886.52]  Can I help you?
[4887.42 --> 4888.40]  Oh, thank you.
[4889.58 --> 4890.92]  What else was I got?
[4890.92 --> 4891.20]  Oh, yeah.
[4891.52 --> 4895.58]  Do you think, did you ever really text using T9?
[4896.22 --> 4899.06]  Like, was that a thing for you for a long time, or did you get a cell phone in there?
[4899.08 --> 4899.72]  Which one was T9?
[4899.72 --> 4899.82]  T9.
[4900.12 --> 4902.94]  T9 was predictive number pad typing.
[4903.36 --> 4903.84]  Yeah, I did.
[4904.06 --> 4907.04]  Okay, so not like press it three times for...
[4907.04 --> 4907.92]  Yeah, no, I did.
[4908.04 --> 4908.66]  Oh, okay, you did.
[4910.50 --> 4914.14]  Do you think you could type faster on T9 than on a touchscreen still?
[4916.76 --> 4918.22]  I think I'd be out of the groove.
[4919.54 --> 4920.92]  I think I'd have to, like, trade...
[4920.92 --> 4922.38]  Because T9 was, like, a...
[4922.38 --> 4923.42]  You could have skill.
[4923.80 --> 4924.18]  Oh, yeah.
[4924.26 --> 4925.44]  You could be really fast on T9.
[4925.44 --> 4928.66]  Like, I knew friends that were, like, insanity fast on T9.
[4929.88 --> 4932.06]  So, like, I think I'd have to get back into it.
[4933.00 --> 4934.04]  I still use it a little.
[4934.66 --> 4936.58]  Because I dial all my contacts with T9.
[4936.98 --> 4937.56]  Oh, interesting.
[4938.04 --> 4938.66]  You don't do that?
[4939.16 --> 4939.94]  I don't do that.
[4940.02 --> 4942.22]  Oh, it's by far the fastest way to call people.
[4942.64 --> 4945.50]  Because you just bring up the dial pad, and then you're just like, boom.
[4946.12 --> 4946.32]  Oh.
[4946.74 --> 4947.00]  Yeah.
[4947.56 --> 4949.68]  And it brings up the corresponding T9 matches.
[4950.26 --> 4950.72]  And if...
[4950.72 --> 4954.32]  But if you dial phone numbers, it also recognizes that.
[4954.56 --> 4955.24]  That's what I do.
[4955.44 --> 4955.64]  Yeah.
[4956.02 --> 4957.42]  But you know people's phone numbers?
[4960.20 --> 4962.08]  Actually, a lot of people that I call, yeah.
[4962.12 --> 4962.40]  Wow, okay.
[4962.58 --> 4963.76]  Well, I'll know a section.
[4964.08 --> 4965.14]  Like, I'll know three digits.
[4965.66 --> 4967.20]  Yours I know, because reasons.
[4967.62 --> 4969.84]  But, like, other people, like, I know four...
[4969.84 --> 4970.58]  Booty calls!
[4970.62 --> 4972.36]  I know four digits of my dad's.
[4972.48 --> 4974.10]  I know three digits of my brother's.
[4974.82 --> 4975.04]  Huh.
[4975.42 --> 4976.14]  Like, yeah.
[4976.36 --> 4978.20]  I'll know, like, a little bit of different people's phone numbers.
[4978.32 --> 4980.06]  Enough that I can type it in there, and it'll come up.
[4980.06 --> 4980.86]  But do you think you could...
[4980.86 --> 4981.64]  Or it's in my favorite scene at the time.
[4981.64 --> 4983.94]  Do you think with practice you could get faster than touchscreen?
[4983.94 --> 4987.54]  Uh, when looking at the phone, yes.
[4988.26 --> 4989.80]  With touchscreen, I can text blindly.
[4991.26 --> 4991.58]  Hmm.
[4991.78 --> 4992.06]  Hmm.
[4992.06 --> 4993.52]  I don't think I can do that with T9.
[4994.02 --> 4995.00]  Oh, okay.
[4995.18 --> 4996.56]  And I think that's probably enough for me.
[4996.96 --> 4997.28]  Right.
[4997.46 --> 4998.36]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[4998.36 --> 5001.08]  I'm actually gonna try and get, like...
[5001.08 --> 5004.10]  I don't even know if it's gonna be, um...
[5004.10 --> 5006.12]  I don't even know if they're gonna have released it in North America.
[5006.22 --> 5007.56]  But I'm gonna try and go back to a flip.
[5007.64 --> 5009.26]  I'm gonna see if I can get a review unit of that phone.
[5009.26 --> 5009.44]  That'd be cool.
[5009.68 --> 5011.04]  I'd be interested in what the battery life's like.
[5011.12 --> 5011.38]  Yeah.
[5011.52 --> 5013.52]  I'd be really interested to know what the battery life's like.
[5013.58 --> 5013.76]  Oh!
[5014.08 --> 5014.34]  Oh!
[5014.34 --> 5016.28]  I can announce the offer code.
[5016.52 --> 5022.40]  So for $3 off everything in the Teespring store, the offer code is all caps HOLIDAY.
[5022.58 --> 5024.70]  Some of you people in chat were complaining about the price tags.
[5025.56 --> 5026.34]  The price tags?
[5026.64 --> 5026.92]  Yeah.
[5027.78 --> 5028.46]  They were too expensive.
[5028.56 --> 5029.32]  The dollar dollar bills?
[5029.54 --> 5029.74]  Yeah.
[5030.02 --> 5031.24]  So what up now, son?
[5032.02 --> 5032.20]  Oh.
[5032.20 --> 5032.54]  Cheaper.
[5032.68 --> 5032.86]  Yeah.
[5033.12 --> 5033.78]  $3 off.
[5033.84 --> 5034.04]  Boom.
[5034.04 --> 5036.68]  Uh, what else we got here?
[5038.48 --> 5039.08]  Um...
[5039.08 --> 5039.80]  Ba-da-da-da.
[5039.82 --> 5041.48]  It's a stupid watch.
[5042.24 --> 5043.42]  Oh, yeah, right.
[5043.52 --> 5044.46]  This stupid thing.
[5044.54 --> 5046.48]  Okay, so...
[5046.48 --> 5047.42]  You know what?
[5047.56 --> 5049.38]  I mean, it's not like the idea is stupid.
[5049.92 --> 5051.60]  Introducing the Block Smartwatch.
[5051.94 --> 5052.94]  The, uh...
[5052.94 --> 5055.16]  We even ripped the name off of Phone Blocks.
[5055.24 --> 5056.46]  Now it's like Watch Blocks.
[5057.06 --> 5058.78]  Um, so it's made of...
[5058.78 --> 5061.90]  It's a modular smartwatch made of several Linksor modules,
[5062.00 --> 5063.80]  each of which can be a variety of different things,
[5063.80 --> 5065.96]  including a fingerprint scanner, heart rate sensor, LED,
[5066.58 --> 5069.46]  SIMDSM, blood oxygen level, blah-blah, haptic feedback,
[5069.70 --> 5071.84]  camera, flash memory, developer module, kinetic charger,
[5071.98 --> 5073.36]  extra battery, body temperature, etc.
[5073.72 --> 5075.10]  We're live on Kickstarter,
[5075.26 --> 5079.18]  and that's when my interest level completely fell off the rails.
[5079.20 --> 5080.18]  So it's a really cool idea,
[5080.30 --> 5081.90]  and then you figure out that they're a Kickstarter project,
[5082.08 --> 5083.62]  and then it's no longer a really cool idea.
[5084.48 --> 5086.70]  Estimated shipping date is June 2016.
[5087.16 --> 5088.48]  Well, I guess it's still a cool idea,
[5088.72 --> 5090.58]  but it's not a cool thing.
[5090.58 --> 5092.48]  But I just have so little faith.
[5092.48 --> 5095.60]  I mean, just in the last week alone, okay,
[5096.14 --> 5098.84]  the coolest cooler made headlines
[5098.84 --> 5103.52]  for not having fulfilled its backers' orders yet,
[5103.74 --> 5107.34]  and having the cooler up for sale on Amazon
[5107.34 --> 5112.02]  in an attempt to recoup the money that they need
[5112.02 --> 5115.56]  to produce the units for the Kickstarter backers,
[5115.60 --> 5117.06]  which I kind of get.
[5117.06 --> 5118.26]  And if I was in their situation,
[5118.26 --> 5121.00]  that's a whole lot better than folding the company outright.
[5121.64 --> 5123.58]  But it really is a kick in the teeth
[5123.58 --> 5125.04]  for the Kickstarter backers
[5125.04 --> 5128.14]  who didn't get their, yeah,
[5128.42 --> 5129.56]  who didn't get their cooler.
[5130.06 --> 5132.52]  And also recently,
[5133.44 --> 5138.10]  after raising a record $34 million on Kickstarter,
[5138.10 --> 5141.74]  $3.4 million on Kickstarter,
[5142.48 --> 5145.52]  Zeno went completely under,
[5146.44 --> 5147.38]  will not be shipping,
[5148.36 --> 5151.32]  did not show demos during an office tour
[5151.32 --> 5152.38]  of the drone flying,
[5152.96 --> 5153.84]  is folding,
[5154.34 --> 5155.62]  and that's it.
[5155.86 --> 5156.82]  Devastating collapse,
[5157.16 --> 5158.02]  promised a lot of drones,
[5158.16 --> 5160.14]  failed to ship almost all of the promised units,
[5160.14 --> 5163.20]  and there you go.
[5165.92 --> 5166.52]  It's just,
[5166.62 --> 5167.60]  it's one of those things where it's like,
[5167.94 --> 5168.12]  okay,
[5169.50 --> 5171.58]  a retail price for a product
[5171.58 --> 5175.56]  is designed to cover the costs of making it,
[5176.08 --> 5176.78]  okay, for one thing,
[5176.78 --> 5180.24]  and then to cover the profit margin for the company.
[5181.14 --> 5183.18]  So what made anyone think,
[5183.26 --> 5184.84]  and this is something I've always wondered about,
[5185.00 --> 5186.34]  what made anyone think
[5186.34 --> 5190.20]  that getting all the funding
[5190.20 --> 5191.04]  for your first,
[5191.22 --> 5191.70]  I don't know,
[5191.76 --> 5193.98]  let's say 5,000 units,
[5194.30 --> 5195.38]  getting all that money
[5195.38 --> 5197.54]  to produce them
[5197.54 --> 5200.10]  at a reduced rate
[5200.10 --> 5203.58]  compared to what you're pretty sure
[5203.58 --> 5204.70]  you need to sell it for
[5204.70 --> 5206.02]  in order to be profitable,
[5206.90 --> 5208.32]  what made anyone think
[5208.32 --> 5209.32]  that that was gonna,
[5209.32 --> 5211.12]  that was gonna kickstart your company,
[5211.62 --> 5213.24]  that that was gonna help you pay for,
[5213.36 --> 5213.52]  you know,
[5213.58 --> 5215.42]  the office and the employees that you need
[5215.42 --> 5216.80]  to ramp up development
[5216.80 --> 5217.94]  and bring the product to market.
[5218.40 --> 5221.30]  You're effectively just selling product.
[5222.28 --> 5223.48]  At a reduced price.
[5223.82 --> 5224.92]  At a reduced price.
[5225.12 --> 5226.56]  So you're not really making money.
[5226.70 --> 5229.40]  So you're selling at an unsustainable price already.
[5229.40 --> 5230.56]  And you're taking the people
[5230.56 --> 5232.28]  that will fanatically buy it
[5232.28 --> 5234.18]  at the normal price,
[5234.90 --> 5235.88]  giving them a discount,
[5236.02 --> 5236.64]  and those are the people
[5236.64 --> 5238.04]  that are actually gonna start running your company.
[5238.04 --> 5239.56]  And that's your plan,
[5239.68 --> 5240.50]  to achieve sustainability.
[5240.50 --> 5243.18]  So yeah,
[5243.38 --> 5246.20]  I wish the watch luck,
[5246.32 --> 5247.24]  the Blox watch luck.
[5247.76 --> 5248.94]  400 milliamp hour batteries,
[5249.06 --> 5249.18]  Snapdragon 400 processor.
[5249.18 --> 5249.66]  What you can do,
[5249.76 --> 5250.84]  just like everything else,
[5250.92 --> 5252.04]  and what we suggested to do
[5252.04 --> 5252.86]  with the laser razor,
[5253.00 --> 5254.18]  so if any of you guys bought that,
[5254.30 --> 5254.50]  rip.
[5255.40 --> 5255.82]  Well, no, it's fine.
[5255.86 --> 5256.50]  They got refunds.
[5256.70 --> 5257.12]  Oh, did they?
[5257.28 --> 5257.46]  Mm-hmm.
[5257.62 --> 5258.08]  Oh, that's cool.
[5258.08 --> 5258.72]  Everyone on Kickstarter,
[5258.80 --> 5260.18]  I don't know how the Indiegogo campaign
[5260.18 --> 5260.68]  is doing, though.
[5261.04 --> 5261.66]  Oh, dear.
[5262.76 --> 5263.70]  Well, I guess it's not a refund
[5263.70 --> 5265.06]  because the campaign didn't finish.
[5265.62 --> 5266.60]  So they didn't pay out.
[5266.70 --> 5266.96]  Right.
[5267.34 --> 5267.64]  Okay.
[5268.64 --> 5269.76]  Just don't do it.
[5269.96 --> 5271.06]  Just wait for it to come out.
[5271.84 --> 5272.70]  If it costs, like,
[5272.72 --> 5273.74]  slightly more money,
[5274.00 --> 5275.80]  like, it's not gonna be that much.
[5276.02 --> 5276.62]  It'll be fine.
[5276.94 --> 5279.58]  Wow, the Scarp raised $430,000
[5279.58 --> 5282.04]  on Indiegogo
[5282.04 --> 5283.04]  and did get funded.
[5284.04 --> 5285.22]  So who knows?
[5285.32 --> 5286.34]  Maybe they'll prove us all wrong.
[5286.46 --> 5287.26]  But if they do,
[5287.42 --> 5288.76]  then just buy it then, man.
[5288.78 --> 5289.00]  Yes.
[5289.30 --> 5289.92]  Don't buy it now.
[5290.34 --> 5291.34]  It's like, don't pre-order.
[5291.70 --> 5292.66]  Things we shouldn't have to say,
[5292.72 --> 5293.04]  but we do.
[5293.76 --> 5294.80]  Speaking of not pre-ordering,
[5294.88 --> 5296.00]  I sure wouldn't pre-order one of these.
[5296.08 --> 5296.92]  Not that it's particularly,
[5296.96 --> 5297.42]  expensive.
[5297.60 --> 5298.90]  LG has partnered with Walmart
[5298.90 --> 5301.68]  to make $10 Android phones.
[5301.94 --> 5304.84]  We're talking smartphones for $10.
[5305.46 --> 5306.54]  Are they great?
[5307.18 --> 5307.78]  No.
[5308.28 --> 5310.12]  But they are undercutting
[5310.12 --> 5312.78]  the previously cheapest phone,
[5312.92 --> 5314.90]  the $35 Firefox OS phone
[5314.90 --> 5316.58]  by a significant margin.
[5316.76 --> 5318.60]  It runs Android 4.4 KitKat.
[5318.82 --> 5320.94]  You get Wi-Fi, but no 4G.
[5321.06 --> 5322.46]  There is no front-facing camera,
[5322.60 --> 5324.76]  but you actually do get a micro SD slot.
[5324.76 --> 5326.84]  How many of these do you think
[5326.84 --> 5328.30]  are going to sell to people
[5328.30 --> 5329.48]  that aren't drug dealers?
[5329.90 --> 5330.06]  Oh.
[5331.64 --> 5333.68]  We were going the same place with that,
[5333.68 --> 5334.90]  but from opposite angles.
[5335.14 --> 5335.30]  Yes.
[5335.30 --> 5338.38]  I don't know.
[5338.38 --> 5338.72]  I mean,
[5338.92 --> 5342.32]  I could see people who just want,
[5342.82 --> 5343.90]  like if my kid,
[5344.32 --> 5344.70]  okay,
[5344.98 --> 5345.90]  if my kid,
[5345.98 --> 5346.28]  you know,
[5346.32 --> 5347.14]  broke a phone
[5347.14 --> 5350.20]  and then needed a phone
[5350.20 --> 5351.58]  and didn't have enough allowance
[5351.58 --> 5352.68]  saved up for a new phone,
[5352.76 --> 5353.24]  I'd be like,
[5353.62 --> 5353.86]  yo,
[5354.30 --> 5355.90]  that's your phone.
[5356.40 --> 5356.88]  They'd be like,
[5357.06 --> 5357.78]  oh, really?
[5357.94 --> 5358.42]  And I'd be like,
[5358.48 --> 5359.00]  oh, really?
[5359.06 --> 5359.74]  Don't break your phone.
[5360.46 --> 5360.72]  Right.
[5360.72 --> 5361.76]  That's about how that conversation,
[5361.84 --> 5363.00]  I could see it being used for that.
[5363.48 --> 5363.66]  Yeah.
[5365.38 --> 5366.00]  I just,
[5366.50 --> 5367.38]  we should get one.
[5367.84 --> 5368.54]  You should review it.
[5370.12 --> 5370.62]  I mean,
[5370.64 --> 5371.60]  it would only cost $10.
[5372.04 --> 5372.30]  Yeah,
[5372.34 --> 5373.14]  I'd be down for that.
[5374.08 --> 5375.44]  It would actually be pretty interesting.
[5375.70 --> 5375.84]  Yeah.
[5375.84 --> 5377.50]  Like how much does,
[5378.18 --> 5380.06]  like compare it to like a Note whatever,
[5380.42 --> 5381.20]  how much does like
[5381.20 --> 5383.64]  1,000 something dollars get you?
[5383.80 --> 5384.14]  Yeah.
[5384.14 --> 5385.28]  Compared to this.
[5385.84 --> 5386.70]  That's really interesting.
[5386.70 --> 5391.46]  The most like insanity price to performance test ever.
[5395.14 --> 5395.78]  All right.
[5395.88 --> 5396.38]  So let's.
[5396.64 --> 5397.44]  Are we doing the thing?
[5397.54 --> 5397.72]  Yeah,
[5397.78 --> 5398.54]  I wanted to do the,
[5398.78 --> 5398.94]  no,
[5399.02 --> 5399.20]  soon.
[5399.84 --> 5400.28]  Fanatic.
[5400.68 --> 5402.06]  Speaking of crowdfunding,
[5402.38 --> 5403.40]  although in this case,
[5403.56 --> 5406.12]  Fanatic is not crowdfunding to raise funds.
[5406.26 --> 5407.40]  They're just crowdfunding for,
[5407.50 --> 5408.36]  as a publicity stunt,
[5408.42 --> 5412.52]  which is what the more successful crowdfunding companies do.
[5412.70 --> 5413.88]  Like that was what the Pono player did.
[5413.90 --> 5414.94]  They already had all their funding.
[5414.94 --> 5416.38]  You think Neil Young needs your,
[5416.62 --> 5416.94]  you know,
[5417.26 --> 5420.10]  hundred thousand or million dollars or whatever Pono player raised.
[5420.74 --> 5421.96]  So Fanatic,
[5422.56 --> 5427.06]  I guess this means the end of their relationship with Steel series,
[5427.24 --> 5431.22]  but they have their own line of gaming equipment now.
[5431.32 --> 5435.28]  It would appear as though they have acquired Funk
[5435.28 --> 5439.42]  and gone ahead and released,
[5440.20 --> 5440.46]  well,
[5440.76 --> 5441.60]  basically what,
[5441.60 --> 5443.60]  I can't quite tell.
[5443.70 --> 5445.22]  I can't see them that closely,
[5445.22 --> 5450.26]  but it looks an awful lot like the existing Funk lineup.
[5450.26 --> 5454.04]  And yeah,
[5454.04 --> 5454.72]  they're basically saying,
[5454.80 --> 5454.92]  yep,
[5454.96 --> 5457.80]  it's no nonsense gaming gear.
[5458.80 --> 5465.12]  And it's for playing games and their peripherals,
[5465.16 --> 5465.52]  I guess.
[5466.64 --> 5468.00]  So there you have it.
[5470.38 --> 5470.86]  Yeah.
[5470.86 --> 5474.14]  So what a weird,
[5474.24 --> 5479.68]  what a weird move for an e-sports team to get into actually making hardware.
[5479.78 --> 5480.22]  Then again,
[5480.66 --> 5481.98]  you look at sort of us,
[5482.24 --> 5482.58]  you know,
[5482.62 --> 5483.14]  going out like,
[5483.20 --> 5483.32]  Oh,
[5483.34 --> 5484.94]  we have a fan now or whatever else.
[5484.96 --> 5485.74]  I guess it's like,
[5485.74 --> 5487.26]  not that bizarre,
[5487.88 --> 5488.88]  but I mean,
[5488.88 --> 5490.24]  we also are not,
[5490.30 --> 5490.78]  you know,
[5490.84 --> 5492.52]  running out and trying to,
[5492.52 --> 5492.94]  you know,
[5492.98 --> 5493.96]  maintain that,
[5494.02 --> 5494.88]  that brand.
[5494.88 --> 5496.50]  And yeah,
[5496.58 --> 5496.82]  very,
[5496.92 --> 5497.28]  very,
[5497.36 --> 5497.90]  very interesting.
[5500.76 --> 5505.72]  AMD is bundling Star Wars Battlefront with select graphics cards.
[5505.84 --> 5508.36]  So that is pretty darn big news.
[5508.82 --> 5512.44]  So that's when you purchase an AMD Radeon R9 Fury graphics card.
[5512.56 --> 5513.58]  Terms and conditions apply.
[5513.78 --> 5514.24]  See blah,
[5514.24 --> 5514.34]  blah,
[5514.34 --> 5514.50]  blah,
[5514.50 --> 5516.40]  AMD.com slash AMD rewards for details.
[5516.98 --> 5518.24]  So that's pretty huge.
[5518.24 --> 5523.34]  If you were planning to buy a graphics card and you were planning to buy Battlefront to play with your new graphics card,
[5523.34 --> 5524.28]  cause that's like a,
[5524.32 --> 5526.62]  what $70 value or something along those lines.
[5527.20 --> 5529.76]  And this is pretty freaking unexpected.
[5530.48 --> 5535.96]  Apple snuck a USB 3.0 compatible lightning port into the iPad pro.
[5536.60 --> 5540.16]  I absolutely love this article.
[5540.90 --> 5542.42]  So for one thing,
[5542.76 --> 5544.18]  the iFixit teardown,
[5544.26 --> 5544.94]  I believe.
[5545.26 --> 5545.46]  Yep.
[5545.54 --> 5548.44]  The iFixit teardown found a USB 3.0 controller.
[5548.86 --> 5551.10]  So even though Apple hadn't said anything about it,
[5551.54 --> 5552.64]  the hardware's in there.
[5552.64 --> 5554.42]  And then they admitted,
[5554.58 --> 5554.76]  yes,
[5554.80 --> 5555.32]  it's in there.
[5555.88 --> 5556.30]  But,
[5556.96 --> 5557.82]  and this is great.
[5559.68 --> 5560.24]  Blah,
[5560.24 --> 5560.36]  blah,
[5560.36 --> 5560.52]  blah,
[5560.52 --> 5560.92]  blah,
[5560.92 --> 5561.24]  blah,
[5561.24 --> 5561.44]  blah,
[5561.52 --> 5561.56]  blah,
[5561.56 --> 5561.80]  blah,
[5561.80 --> 5561.92]  blah,
[5561.92 --> 5562.44]  blah,
[5562.44 --> 5562.52]  blah,
[5562.52 --> 5563.04]  blah,
[5563.04 --> 5563.56]  blah,
[5563.56 --> 5563.60]  blah,
[5563.60 --> 5563.64]  blah,
[5563.64 --> 5563.68]  blah,
[5563.68 --> 5563.72]  blah,
[5563.72 --> 5564.24]  blah,
[5564.24 --> 5564.44]  blah,
[5564.44 --> 5565.24]  blah,
[5565.24 --> 5565.76]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5565.76 --> 5565.96]  Oh no,
[5565.96 --> 5566.80]  maybe it was a different,
[5566.80 --> 5568.44]  maybe it was a different article I was reading about it,
[5568.44 --> 5569.00]  but it was like,
[5569.84 --> 5575.00]  and Apple users have been trying their USB 3,
[5575.00 --> 5579.06]  or their USB 2 lightning connectors to see if they get the extra speed.
[5579.06 --> 5581.64]  They would, wouldn't they?
[5581.64 --> 5584.34]  USB 3 requires more pins.
[5584.34 --> 5588.74]  So what I'm assuming is that there's going to be a significantly modified lightning connector
[5588.74 --> 5592.38]  that somehow works with it or whatever.
[5592.38 --> 5596.86]  And that'll, that'll, that'll all become more, more apparent in the future.
[5596.86 --> 5602.06]  So the current USB 2.0 models, I don't know if they'll be backwards or forwards compatible,
[5602.06 --> 5603.18]  or how the whole thing's going to work.
[5603.18 --> 5605.26]  But, yeah, it looks like good stuff.
[5605.26 --> 5608.86]  I had really hoped that Apple would just go USB type C.
[5610.46 --> 5614.22]  But it looks like either they're not ready, or they're going to continue down the lightning path
[5614.22 --> 5619.18]  if they can find a way to make it, make it more interoperable within their own ecosystem.
[5619.90 --> 5621.58]  Which I get. Totally get.
[5622.38 --> 5626.22]  So, speaking of things that I get, I get to end the show now.
[5626.22 --> 5627.02]  Yeah.
[5628.06 --> 5630.54]  But, the after party is happening.
[5630.54 --> 5631.98]  I have pre-tested.
[5631.98 --> 5636.86]  We are going to be watching ultra-wide festival honorable mentions today.
[5637.82 --> 5639.50]  See you in the after party.
[5642.54 --> 5643.26]  Good show today.
[5643.26 --> 5645.34]  We had 7,500 viewers for like a lot of it.
[5645.34 --> 5645.66]  Awesome.
[5646.30 --> 5646.54]  Yeah.
[5647.26 --> 5647.66]  Awesome.
[5649.10 --> 5650.54]  Everything is awesome.
[5650.54 --> 5653.26]  I'll just sing that song.
[5653.26 --> 5655.26]  Everything is cool when you follow the rules.
[5655.26 --> 5656.38]  Doesn't that help?
[5656.38 --> 5656.94]  Yeah.
[5656.94 --> 5658.06]  When you're part of a team.
[5658.06 --> 5658.70]  Part of a team.
[5658.70 --> 5659.10]  Yeah.
[5659.10 --> 5660.14]  I'm part of a team.
[5660.14 --> 5660.86]  I'm part of a team.
[5663.82 --> 5664.86]  Team life.
[5665.82 --> 5669.10]  I'm not really a very team, teamy thing to call it as a joke.
[5670.38 --> 5671.02]  I'm really not actually.
[5671.02 --> 5671.66]  But I did that.
[5671.66 --> 5672.22]  You did.
[5674.62 --> 5676.94]  I'm basically just a shitty person at the end of the day.
[5676.94 --> 5677.26]  No.
[5678.06 --> 5679.10]  I have my redeeming qualities.
[5679.10 --> 5679.82]  You're just a narcissist.
