[0.00 → 5.68] So, Luke is very fond of talking about how whenever I'm not here, the show starts on time.
[5.90 → 13.40] So I would like for you guys to note that he's not here, and the show almost started on time.
[13.60 → 20.10] So, clearly, it's actually him amplifying my lateness.
[20.46 → 23.22] And that's why whenever we're both here, the show is late.
[25.42 → 29.12] Yes, that is the obvious conclusion that we can draw here.
[29.12 → 38.22] So, as you guys probably noticed already, and if you didn't, then hopefully the part where I pointed out that Luke's not here would have drawn you to this conclusion.
[38.76 → 40.48] Luke is not here!
[40.72 → 49.18] He is over in Computer, and so the first topic of the day is actually something that I should probably do after the intro.
[49.32 → 51.20] Right, so we've got a great show for you guys today.
[51.54 → 55.30] We have all of our Computer coverage, some of the highlights from that.
[55.30 → 61.46] We've got AMD unveiling many, many more details about their upcoming Fiji.
[61.84 → 66.36] Although, it looks like we're going to have to wait a little bit for the rest of it.
[66.72 → 73.06] NVIDIA launches Mobile G-Sync, which, by the way, I have in-house already.
[73.54 → 76.34] And tons and tons of monitors.
[76.50 → 78.42] Oh yeah, right, the huge news this week.
[78.42 → 82.42] Valve pulled a 180 on their customer service, and they're offering...
[83.00 → 84.76] Well, okay, whatever, I'll tell you guys about it later.
[85.48 → 87.06] For now, let's roll the intro.
[90.16 → 91.44] Oh, come on!
[92.12 → 94.66] One of these days, that's going to work.
[95.06 → 96.38] And then I will be happy.
[96.96 → 98.14] So right now, you guys are...
[98.14 → 98.66] You know what?
[98.78 → 99.80] Forget it, then.
[100.54 → 106.50] Sponsors today, lynda.com, FreshBooks, and Dollar Shave Club.
[106.72 → 107.34] There you go.
[107.46 → 108.42] We are just...
[108.42 → 109.38] I don't care.
[109.78 → 111.22] We're just not going to have an intro.
[111.58 → 112.30] I give up.
[115.10 → 115.88] You know what?
[116.38 → 119.60] I've got some people saying they thought that Luke would call in.
[120.08 → 126.14] He said that last week, but quite frankly, it's 7 a.m. over there right now, or 7.30.
[126.68 → 131.84] And if you guys noticed some skepticism on my part when he was saying that he was going
[131.84 → 138.50] to call in, it was because I can do time zones, and I knew that he was straight up, A, going
[138.50 → 144.56] to be probably not awake at that time, and B, I knew he was going to be busting his butt
[144.56 → 148.94] over the course of the week, getting a bunch of great coverage of Computer for you guys.
[148.94 → 153.56] And therefore, probably not in any condition where he would want to, or I would even want
[153.56 → 159.36] him to be doing an hour and a half livestream, because they have absolutely kicked ass over
[159.36 → 160.20] at Computer.
[160.26 → 162.74] In fact, we can go, and I don't think...
[162.74 → 167.58] Yeah, I don't think there's anything here that's like super, super top secret, but I'm
[167.58 → 168.78] going to post some of the links.
[169.42 → 171.34] You guys should definitely check this out later.
[171.44 → 174.78] If you're watching the archive, I will link these below the video.
[174.78 → 179.40] But the Corsair Bulldog, huge deal over at Computer.
[179.40 → 187.28] Corsair, not necessarily because of the Corsair Bulldog, but because it's going mainstream.
[187.28 → 192.40] Guys like Silverstone have been trying to do the whole, yeah, we've got like a full-size graphics
[192.40 → 198.24] card in a tiny form factor or small internal volume enclosure for some time.
[198.24 → 203.86] N-Case released the M1, which was this tiny full-size graphics card thing.
[203.86 → 208.58] Well, now a mainstream case manufacturer, and it's kind of funny for me to say that,
[208.64 → 213.52] because I still remember when they launched the 800D, and the store that I worked for was
[213.52 → 217.52] like nervous about bringing in too many, because a Corsair case?
[218.00 → 218.70] Gee, I don't know.
[218.80 → 219.30] Will it work?
[219.36 → 220.04] Will it not work?
[220.04 → 225.06] Yeah, it turns out they're a mainstream case maker now, and they are acknowledging the small
[225.06 → 227.68] form factor console-size case.
[228.10 → 229.24] Very cool stuff.
[229.74 → 232.16] Next up, we've got, what's the other one?
[232.22 → 232.86] Oh, yeah.
[233.28 → 237.08] MSI desktop GPUs for their AIO and laptop.
[237.08 → 243.60] Now, MSI hasn't completely redone the whole GS30 shadow concept.
[243.60 → 251.38] In fact, what they were showing off was same laptop, but now they have a sexier enclosure
[251.38 → 251.88] for it.
[251.94 → 257.78] So instead of being stuck with that ginormous external box that just had a standard ATX power
[257.78 → 262.00] supply in it, they have something that is a little bit sexier.
[262.28 → 263.66] So that's pretty cool too.
[263.82 → 264.44] Ah, yes.
[264.56 → 266.26] GTX 780 Ti variant.
[266.50 → 268.72] So always a big hit.
[268.72 → 275.38] It's funny, because it blows me away every single time how much you guys love the latest
[275.38 → 276.60] high-end graphics cards.
[276.96 → 284.04] Our GTX 780 Ti review has 400,000 views, and that went up, what, a week ago?
[284.64 → 289.86] That's like Scrapyard Wars levels of viewership in the first week.
[289.94 → 291.18] That's absolutely crazy.
[291.64 → 297.22] So Luke actually highlighted a couple of after market-designed 780 Tis.
[297.22 → 299.38] One from Asus, one from Gigabyte.
[299.72 → 300.62] Did I say 780?
[300.72 → 302.56] Ah, I keep doing this.
[302.86 → 303.82] You know what's hilarious?
[304.28 → 304.78] 980 Ti.
[305.18 → 305.62] I know.
[305.78 → 306.56] I get out of here.
[306.86 → 307.42] 980 Ti.
[307.54 → 307.92] I know.
[309.40 → 314.04] I actually started hearing rumours about the GTX 980 Ti.
[314.98 → 318.68] Probably around the same time you guys started hearing rumours about it.
[318.88 → 322.02] And a lot of the time, there's a lot of truth to the rumours.
[322.02 → 325.70] And so I reached out to my NVIDIA contact.
[325.86 → 331.08] I was like, to dog, can I get a sample of the 780 Ti?
[331.36 → 333.52] And I did it not once, but twice.
[334.10 → 335.68] Twice in the first email.
[336.02 → 339.18] My subject line was blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, something 780 Ti.
[339.44 → 341.30] Hey, blah, blah, blah, something 780 Ti.
[341.30 → 345.38] And he replied to me.
[345.70 → 350.38] He's like, yeah, sure, I can send you a sample, but it's kind of old.
[351.10 → 353.28] And I'm just like, you troll.
[353.50 → 354.44] You knew what I meant.
[354.86 → 356.52] You knew what I meant.
[356.86 → 357.50] You troll.
[357.50 → 360.50] And then when I sent a follow-up email, I don't even think I got an answer.
[360.68 → 367.12] Because NVIDIA are like the kings of if it ain't out, it ain't being talked about.
[367.28 → 369.72] They are pretty good at keeping secrets.
[370.34 → 375.58] So yes, 980 Ti, non-reference 980 Tis.
[375.72 → 378.28] And then one of the other big ones.
[378.36 → 381.68] You guys should save these URLs for later if you haven't already checked out the videos.
[382.22 → 383.64] This is another huge one.
[383.64 → 391.00] NVIDIA launched the most bankers, or announced, I don't think it's actually available yet,
[391.36 → 395.02] announced the most bankers case ever.
[395.66 → 396.38] Check this out.
[396.46 → 400.02] Oh yeah, I do want to do a huge thanks to our sponsors over at Computer.
[400.10 → 402.42] That's lynda.com and MSI.
[402.64 → 403.40] Look at this thing.
[404.38 → 410.92] This is the kind of stuff that concept cars are made of.
[410.92 → 416.88] Typically, you expect a case like this to just be like a one-off that some fodder made.
[417.32 → 419.40] Not the case at all.
[419.62 → 423.90] This will be an actual case that you can actually buy.
[424.60 → 427.28] Here's some footage from Brandon of the thing transforming.
[428.14 → 428.56] Look at that.
[428.96 → 430.58] I mean, is that not ridiculous?
[431.86 → 432.66] Electrician training.
[432.90 → 433.08] Really?
[433.44 → 434.90] I guess I could be an electrician.
[435.00 → 435.42] Sure, why not?
[435.80 → 436.50] That lighting.
[436.70 → 437.34] Holy crap.
[437.34 → 442.86] Irwin is one of those companies where like five years ago, as far as I could tell, they
[442.86 → 446.84] only made cheapo commodity cases and like bad power supplies.
[447.10 → 454.14] And then all of a sudden, they decided to like, okay, we're going to do like tempered glass
[454.14 → 455.50] side panels on this one.
[455.56 → 458.52] We're going to do like this crazy transforming thing.
[458.54 → 462.20] And they decided to totally shake up the case industry.
[462.20 → 467.34] I don't know if they're shaking it up necessarily in terms of sales volumes because some of those
[467.34 → 471.44] products have been pretty darn expensive, but they are definitely shaking it up in terms
[471.44 → 474.20] of design, which is very cool stuff.
[474.42 → 476.46] So let's get into the news for this week.
[476.54 → 478.72] Our first, and I'm going to have to be the one.
[478.78 → 480.28] So this was posted by Mule.
[480.64 → 485.18] And I'll have to be the one who posts these links in the forum for you guys, unfortunately,
[485.18 → 488.96] because I don't have my lovely assistant this week.
[489.56 → 497.80] But Nantes reports that the GTX 980 Ti shows a significant difference in pixel fill rates
[497.80 → 500.38] compared to the GTX Titan X.
[500.76 → 507.74] And what's interesting about this is the fact that their real world performance is so similar
[507.74 → 510.70] depending on who you ask.
[510.70 → 517.62] So I was, so hold on, first we'll go through, so in synthetic performance tests, you'll see
[517.62 → 523.16] a similar performance between the two cards in general, but the 980 Ti loses two polymorph
[523.16 → 527.92] engines in test mark due to losing two SMMs, though that doesn't really hinder the 980 Ti
[527.92 → 530.96] in gaming or in that test overall.
[531.08 → 536.68] The 980 Ti loses some rasterization throughput from the SMM lost, but the 15% drop is larger
[536.68 → 541.62] than can be accounted for by the two SMs, which account for approximately 10%.
[541.62 → 545.56] Right now there's 5% that cannot be accounted for at this point in testing.
[545.66 → 551.06] So the 980 Ti is actually a little bit of a mystery right now.
[551.14 → 555.72] So there are some weird differences in pixel fill rate, there are some weird differences in
[555.72 → 561.20] test mark, and there's some weird stuff that I can't really account for in the real world
[561.20 → 566.92] performance as well, because I was talking to the NCI X guys, and they had 980 Ti as a
[566.92 → 574.12] clear loser to Titan X, whereas actually in the Nantes review and in my review, I had
[574.12 → 576.20] it pretty damns close.
[576.68 → 582.12] And I was pretty sure at the time of releasing mine that the difference could be accounted
[582.12 → 587.86] for by my 980 Ti boosting up higher than my GTX Titan X.
[587.86 → 592.86] But based on some of these synthetic tests over at Nantes, we could be looking at something
[592.86 → 594.96] a little bit deeper than that.
[595.22 → 600.78] And NVIDIA has been doing this lately where they really don't want to talk about the architecture
[600.78 → 602.36] of the chip a lot.
[602.84 → 609.12] They tried to pull that off with GTX 980 and 970, and whether unintentionally or intentionally,
[609.38 → 614.02] and I'll leave it to whoever wears whichever colour of tinfoil hat they wear to determine
[614.02 → 620.20] what they thought, I personally don't think NVIDIA intentionally screwed up the specs of
[620.20 → 620.98] the 970 Ti.
[621.28 → 625.20] What happened was because they didn't give the press a lot of information about the architecture,
[625.48 → 630.32] that wasn't discovered for months, and it turned into VRAM gate with people trading in
[630.32 → 635.76] their GTX 970s and demanding full refunds because it didn't have the maximum memory bandwidth
[635.76 → 638.52] for the last 500 legs of that 4 gig frame buffer.
[638.52 → 642.76] So hopefully we're not looking at anything like that.
[642.94 → 648.70] The reality of it is it doesn't seem to be affecting 4K gaming performance in any meaningful
[648.70 → 649.08] way.
[649.20 → 652.56] That's validated by all of my 4K testing on the card.
[652.76 → 656.50] So it looks like a kick-ass card.
[656.64 → 660.52] Hopefully this doesn't, this is not going to be any kind of issue.
[660.52 → 665.50] Um, Asus is showing off a new professional grade 4K monitor.
[665.62 → 668.82] This was posted by the Gage on the forum.
[668.92 → 672.40] I'm going to go ahead and, I'm pretty much going to treat the whole show today, by the
[672.40 → 679.02] way, guys, like rapid fire, because I straight up am not going to have, I'm not going to be
[679.02 → 682.16] able to hit all these topics if I, if I don't do that.
[682.16 → 689.80] So the source here is PCDIY.ASUS.com and this thing looks absolutely sick.
[689.94 → 695.84] Asus has really stepped up their game in terms of monitors going from just being kind of
[695.84 → 703.60] cheapo, uh, commodity stuff all the way up to some pretty fantastic displays.
[703.70 → 711.30] I mean, the DOG Swift PG278Q was undeniably in my mind, the best gaming monitor on the market
[711.30 → 712.08] when it launched.
[712.56 → 719.02] It has since, um, it's had, it's got some tough competition right now for me from Acer's
[719.02 → 724.54] 4K G-Sync IPS, as well as from BenQ's XL2730Z.
[724.78 → 730.36] Not because I think the 2730Z is necessarily a better monitor, but because it comes in at
[730.36 → 731.96] a significantly lower price.
[732.22 → 734.24] It has Free Sync, but not G-Sync.
[734.34 → 738.14] So AMD gamers are going to have to choose that anyway, if they want variable refresh rate.
[738.14 → 743.82] And on top of all that stuff, uh, the BenQ monitor supports additional inputs, which
[743.82 → 747.38] right now any G-Sync monitor is not going to be able to do.
[747.46 → 749.68] So this one looks pretty fantastic.
[749.68 → 752.60] It's 4K of course.
[752.78 → 754.10] It's geared towards professionals.
[754.36 → 757.14] It features a hundred percent of it will be RGB colour gamut.
[757.32 → 762.40] It's got 138 pixels per inch, which is going to make sense since it's a 32-inch monitor and
[762.40 → 768.38] supports a 10 pit, uh, supports, uh, has a 10 bit display with a 16 bit lookup table, which
[768.38 → 774.16] is important because the way that a monitor approximates a colour behind the scenes.
[774.16 → 779.22] So with the more granularity it can do that actually, the better it can represent it on
[779.22 → 780.20] the panel itself.
[780.20 → 785.80] Even if the panel can't actually display as many colours as the lookup table can understand.
[785.80 → 789.36] Nvidia launches mobile G-Sync.
[789.36 → 794.76] The original poster here are good bites, and we've got a number of different sources here.
[794.76 → 800.68] I guess I'll go ahead and fire up the Nantes one since, uh, I love those guys.
[800.68 → 801.98] They're good guys over there.
[801.98 → 809.04] Good old Ryan Smith and Dr. Curtis and, uh, I'm sure I'm forgetting someone else who's really
[809.04 → 810.04] nice.
[810.04 → 812.40] Those are the guys that I sort of have actually chatted with anyway.
[812.40 → 815.82] Um, what do they, what do we have to say about it?
[815.82 → 818.40] Always synchronized, variable overdrive.
[818.40 → 820.00] Actually variable overdrive is kind of important.
[820.00 → 823.16] I can talk a little bit about that, but not, not too, too much.
[823.16 → 826.12] Uh, SLI support, uh, windowed mode support.
[826.12 → 829.82] So G-Sync is actually getting a fair bit of cool stuff.
[829.82 → 831.22] Windowed mode support's a big one.
[831.22 → 837.72] A lot of people prefer gaming in a full screen windowed mode and that was not supported in
[837.72 → 840.26] G, with G-Sync up until now.
[840.26 → 843.34] So they went ahead, they launched that along with the 980 Ti.
[843.34 → 848.00] Variable overdrive is something I didn't talk about at all in my 980 Ti video, even though
[848.00 → 851.42] it's news that came out around the same time.
[851.42 → 853.86] And what it means is, okay.
[853.86 → 859.26] So pixel response times, when you talk about gray to gray or black to white or, you know,
[859.26 → 860.26] whatever.
[860.26 → 865.86] However, however LCD manufacturers want to talk about pixel response times is basically the
[865.86 → 871.74] amount of time in milliseconds that it takes for an individual pixel on average to go
[871.74 → 876.66] from one colour to another colour, whatever spec, whatever colour shift we're looking at.
[876.66 → 879.70] So gray to gray would be gray and then back to gray.
[879.70 → 886.90] So pixel response times are a factor for colour reproduction.
[886.90 → 891.58] Because if you have a moving object across the screen and the pixels can't respond fast
[891.58 → 896.52] enough, you're going to have like a weird colour ghost behind moving objects where there
[896.52 → 899.22] is a high contrast line.
[899.22 → 901.98] So something like Freelancer was a great example of this.
[901.98 → 906.74] A bit of an older game now, but so are most of the games that I've logged serious hours in.
[906.74 → 912.54] And on my old Dell 24-inch monitor, I really noticed that whenever the wing tips of my spacecraft
[912.54 → 918.94] moved around, there was a serious, we used to call it, we called it ghosting and then we
[918.94 → 919.94] decided that wasn't right.
[919.94 → 921.14] And then we called it motion blur.
[921.14 → 922.80] I think we're back to calling it ghosting.
[922.80 → 924.46] I don't know, whatever.
[924.46 → 929.94] There's a trailing discolouration behind, behind wing tips whenever there's a high contrast line.
[929.94 → 936.26] Now variable refresh rate throws a real monkey wrench into this.
[936.26 → 941.22] Because what you can do through a feature called overdrive is you can actually push the pixels
[941.22 → 944.26] harder to change faster.
[944.26 → 948.20] And that's how you're able, that's one of the ways that you can reduce pixel response
[948.20 → 950.44] time and reduce this motion blur.
[950.44 → 956.84] But variable refresh rate, so when the pixels are actually being told to refresh at uneven
[956.84 → 963.44] intervals, can cause not necessarily a blurry artifact behind a moving object, but what it can cause
[963.44 → 970.12] is differences in the stage that the pixels are at in terms of switching colours depending
[970.12 → 972.40] on how quickly the whole panel is refreshing.
[972.40 → 979.84] So NVIDIA has basically come out with a way to have overdrive applied on the fly according
[979.84 → 983.28] to how quickly the monitor is refreshing.
[983.28 → 984.88] And that's a new G-Sync feature.
[984.88 → 988.44] But the big one, the one I'm supposed to be talking about is mobile G-Sync.
[988.44 → 994.82] And this was causing waves right around the same time as VRAM gate because it was kind
[994.82 → 1001.04] of revealed through a site that was using a driver that ASUS had accidentally leaked to
[1001.04 → 1002.04] them.
[1002.04 → 1007.72] Revealed that there was a particular ASUS laptop, I believe it was the G751 that could
[1007.72 → 1011.44] be tricked into running G-Sync, but it wasn't quite working.
[1011.44 → 1016.40] PC perspective did a great follow up on it where they really investigated it, found out
[1016.40 → 1018.00] it wasn't quite working right.
[1018.00 → 1024.92] But what this revealed was that G-Sync could run without a dedicated G-Sync scaler chip.
[1024.92 → 1029.60] And in fact in notebooks, it was speculated at the time, that was how it would be run
[1029.60 → 1035.28] because of power constraints and space constraints on notebooks.
[1035.28 → 1040.30] So that looks like what has finally happened.
[1040.30 → 1041.62] So there you go.
[1041.62 → 1046.40] The one that we actually have here in house is not from ASUS.
[1046.40 → 1049.76] In fact, we didn't get it sampled by NVIDIA either.
[1049.76 → 1053.16] It's a company called Sager.
[1053.16 → 1056.92] I'll find out before I do my review what the correct pronunciation is for it.
[1056.92 → 1064.20] But they make laptops, and they've sent us one of their models that actually has a 4790K
[1064.20 → 1065.60] desktop CPU in it.
[1065.60 → 1073.96] It's got a GTX 980M, and it's got a 75Hz variable refresh rate 1080p IPS display in it that I have
[1073.96 → 1075.26] played around with a little bit now.
[1075.36 → 1079.76] And I got to tell you guys, G-Sync on mobile makes a lot of sense, just like it makes sense
[1079.76 → 1080.62] on a desktop to me.
[1080.74 → 1084.96] I love variable refresh rate and yeah, it's a great gaming experience.
[1084.96 → 1087.58] So it uses embedded DisplayPort.
[1087.58 → 1096.04] Remember guys that laptops have already had some manner, certain ones, some manner of
[1096.04 → 1098.74] variable refresh rate for some time.
[1098.74 → 1100.80] It was used as a power saving feature.
[1100.80 → 1105.68] So now it's using embedded DisplayPort in order to enable this particular feature.
[1105.68 → 1111.46] There's no power consuming chip required, and it's actually very similar to how AMD Free Sync functions
[1111.46 → 1113.20] on the desktop side.
[1113.20 → 1117.14] So those two technologies should perform quite similarly on mobile.
[1117.14 → 1125.10] Now something that is not clear yet is whether NVIDIA is going to enable G-Sync module
[1125.10 → 1131.34] less G-Sync on the desktop and adopt an open standard or do whatever else it is down the
[1131.34 → 1131.54] road.
[1131.54 → 1137.78] But the word on the street and what NVIDIA has said publicly is that there's more that
[1137.78 → 1142.66] they can do with the G-Sync module than what they can do without the G-Sync module.
[1142.92 → 1147.40] So mobile G-Sync is going to be better than no G-Sync or no Free Sync.
[1147.76 → 1154.14] But mobile G-Sync might not necessarily ever be able to be as good as desktop G-Sync.
[1154.14 → 1157.48] So stay tuned for that.
[1157.74 → 1159.62] Let me just see if I'm missing anything else.
[1159.72 → 1164.74] Apparently Optimum is not available with mobile G-Sync yet since there's no support from Intel
[1164.74 → 1165.92] yet.
[1166.56 → 1169.88] And I guess that's pretty much it.
[1170.64 → 1173.74] Yeah, other than that, it's pretty much the way G-Sync works.
[1173.74 → 1178.88] So AMD Fiji was somewhat unveiled at Computer.
[1178.94 → 1183.26] So this was posted by Dr. Deconstruct on the forum.
[1183.38 → 1185.36] Let's go ahead and post this link in here.
[1186.00 → 1186.64] Hey, look at that.
[1186.84 → 1191.16] I can get 4,000 of you to watch even if I don't have Luke.
[1191.24 → 1193.08] Maybe I should just get rid of him entirely.
[1193.56 → 1194.60] Because what do we get?
[1194.64 → 1196.46] About 6,000 when we do have Luke?
[1196.62 → 1197.14] Yeah, okay.
[1197.18 → 1198.60] I guess he's still pulling his weight around here.
[1198.60 → 1199.22] I'm just kidding.
[1199.80 → 1201.50] I feel weird.
[1201.50 → 1206.56] I feel weird hosting the show without having Luke here accompanying me.
[1206.72 → 1208.06] But I totally understand.
[1208.16 → 1208.94] He needs to sleep.
[1209.06 → 1210.40] They've done a great job at the show.
[1211.02 → 1212.82] Let's go ahead and pull this up.
[1212.96 → 1216.02] So this is videocards.com.
[1216.16 → 1222.34] But quite frankly, there have been so many leaks and so many...
[1222.34 → 1225.88] There's so much speculation that all kind of points in the same direction that I think
[1225.88 → 1231.44] anyone's pretty much as credible as anyone else when it comes to Radeon R9.
[1231.50 → 1236.14] Fury as it is rumoured to be going to be called.
[1236.36 → 1247.66] So the current sort of consensus among rumours is that Radeon R9 390X and Down are going to be rebrands.
[1248.04 → 1253.22] Maybe not straight rebrands because it was also revealed that AMD's...
[1253.22 → 1256.50] Oh, and I'm going to screw it up because there are so many code names.
[1257.12 → 1259.34] I believe it was Tonga.
[1259.88 → 1261.74] Tonga 384-bit.
[1262.26 → 1263.72] Let's just have a quick look.
[1264.88 → 1265.36] Yes.
[1265.36 → 1268.78] So AMD, actually, this is from WCCF Tech.
[1269.14 → 1284.54] AMD's Tonga GPU, which, again, this is off memory, but I believe our buddy Scott Wasson over at Tech Report was pretty damn sure was a 384-bit memory controller capable chip.
[1284.54 → 1291.92] Even though the only card it's appeared in is a 256-bit memory controller card, like memory interface card.
[1292.36 → 1299.26] It looks like, if that's who said it, and I'm pretty darn sure it was, it looks like he was right.
[1299.26 → 1316.08] So even though the current rumour is that anything 390X and Down is basically going to be rebadges of current GPUs, we might get some curveballs thrown in there, especially if AMD decides to do a fully enabled Tonga.
[1316.08 → 1340.94] So the rumour, then, is that the Fiji GPU is going to appear in a Halo-type card, much like NVIDIA's Titan series, and it's going to be called the Fury, which, if you've been following formerly ATI, but now AMD, graphics cards for a really long time might be a bit of a familiar name.
[1341.62 → 1342.34] Rage Fury?
[1342.70 → 1343.60] Anybody remember those?
[1343.60 → 1350.20] So it looks like this might be a bit of a throwback kind of name to the old ATI days, but there you go.
[1350.48 → 1351.56] It's pictured here.
[1351.68 → 1352.90] Fiji makes a public appearance.
[1353.10 → 1355.66] There's four stacks of high-bandwidth memory.
[1355.98 → 1366.08] Remember, guys, that's one of the things that makes it super high-bandwidth, the fact that they are able to put it right next to the GPU instead of having it take up a bunch of space on a board.
[1366.58 → 1368.32] And there you go.
[1368.60 → 1370.28] That's it being shown off by AMD.
[1370.28 → 1373.48] So this is on videocards.com.
[1373.60 → 1375.60] Very cool.
[1376.76 → 1382.58] Current rumours also suggest that Fiji is going to be quite a small graphics card.
[1382.66 → 1387.06] And given that you don't need a bunch of room on the PCB, it kind of makes sense.
[1387.20 → 1388.08] But, you know what?
[1388.08 → 1389.96] I kind of want to do a straw poll about this.
[1390.68 → 1391.66] Straw poll.
[1391.66 → 1396.66] Do you guys feel like a smaller graphics card...
[1397.46 → 1401.12] Does it feel like you're getting less for your money?
[1402.12 → 1409.04] Does a small graphics card make your e-peen feel inadequate?
[1409.04 → 1413.80] Because it's not like NVIDIA's never done this before.
[1413.92 → 1419.04] I mean, the GTX 670 was a second-from-the-top-tier card, effectively.
[1419.04 → 1421.86] And it had that tiny, short PCB.
[1422.38 → 1426.12] And then it had that penis extension, as I called it at the time.
[1426.44 → 1430.10] Plastic shroud extension that made the card actually bigger.
[1430.30 → 1433.04] That reduced compatibility with...
[1433.04 → 1434.04] Here, let's...
[1434.04 → 1436.02] Okay.
[1436.78 → 1438.26] So let's go with...
[1438.26 → 1440.02] Let's come up with a nonsense option.
[1440.94 → 1443.28] So NVIDIA's actually done that before.
[1443.40 → 1444.32] But if you water cooled...
[1444.32 → 1444.58] So, right.
[1444.64 → 1448.66] So they hurt compatibility with cases in order to make it seem bigger.
[1448.78 → 1450.38] And also to have room for the blower fan.
[1450.46 → 1451.84] But that's neither here nor there.
[1451.84 → 1457.52] And guys who water cooled those things ended up with, like, this, like, badass-looking motherboard.
[1457.78 → 1460.06] And, like, huge RAM with rights all over it.
[1460.06 → 1461.72] And then this, like, itty-bitty graphics card.
[1461.98 → 1463.08] And it kind of, like...
[1463.08 → 1467.34] I almost felt like it was, like, a way to get you to buy a GTX 680.
[1467.40 → 1470.06] Just to get a decent-sized card so it would look cool in your system.
[1470.18 → 1472.00] So, I want to hear from you guys.
[1472.46 → 1476.34] Does a small graphics card make your e-peen feel inadequate?
[1476.78 → 1480.32] So if you bought a Fiji for, you know, let's say, similar price.
[1480.32 → 1483.60] Let's say somewhere between a GTX 980 Ti pricing.
[1483.96 → 1487.60] So, you know, $650 and, like, Titan X pricing.
[1487.74 → 1488.30] So $1,000.
[1488.80 → 1491.04] Would you feel like you got ripped off if it was small?
[1491.60 → 1495.18] We've got 47% of you saying, no, it's no big deal.
[1495.34 → 1496.08] Doesn't matter.
[1496.50 → 1505.12] We've got 35% of you, though, saying that, yes, a small graphics card makes me feel inadequate.
[1505.54 → 1507.56] Which is pretty darn interesting.
[1507.56 → 1510.88] With 18% of you voting for eyeliner.
[1511.82 → 1513.26] Which is great.
[1513.60 → 1517.34] I mean, if you guys can wear it nearly as well as Johnny Depp, then I feel pretty good for you.
[1518.38 → 1518.78] Alright.
[1519.72 → 1524.50] Microsoft explains what you'll lose by upgrading to Windows 10.
[1524.58 → 1526.82] This was posted by Fuzzy Crump kin.
[1527.20 → 1528.70] Let's go ahead and copy the link.
[1528.70 → 1532.62] I can't believe we're, like, almost half an hour into the show.
[1532.72 → 1536.10] Because I have so many topics today.
[1536.32 → 1538.40] The original article here is from The Verge.
[1538.44 → 1540.40] So let's go ahead and pull that bad boy up.
[1541.28 → 1541.96] Go, Internet!
[1542.56 → 1544.72] Microsoft explains what you'll lose.
[1544.76 → 1546.44] Because they're offering it.
[1546.52 → 1548.58] And you guys have probably seen notifications.
[1548.74 → 1550.78] In fact, I'm screen sharing right now.
[1550.92 → 1551.36] There you go.
[1551.80 → 1553.98] So the process goes a little something like this.
[1554.64 → 1555.78] Get Windows 10.
[1556.76 → 1557.16] Reserve.
[1557.64 → 1557.96] Okay.
[1558.58 → 1558.94] Install.
[1559.48 → 1559.86] Enjoy.
[1561.68 → 1563.18] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1563.28 → 1565.14] So here they tell us a bunch of good stuff about it.
[1565.38 → 1568.44] And then you go ahead and you, I think, something here, whatever.
[1568.56 → 1568.82] I don't know.
[1568.86 → 1569.88] I did it on another computer.
[1570.00 → 1571.54] I don't understand how to do it anymore, apparently.
[1571.66 → 1572.76] Learn more on Windows.com.
[1572.80 → 1572.96] Whatever.
[1573.40 → 1577.52] So the point is, they're not really talking about some of the things that you are going to lose.
[1577.62 → 1580.24] So Windows Media Centre is going away.
[1580.54 → 1585.80] So if you're one of the seven people on Earth who uses Windows Media Centre, then you might be a little bit disappointed.
[1586.06 → 1588.24] And there is no downgrade that I'm aware of.
[1588.30 → 1592.30] Microsoft seems to be confident enough that this is not a Vista.
[1592.30 → 1597.20] And people are not going to be clamouring to downgrade and then upgrade later, if at all.
[1599.40 → 1600.20] Update to do.
[1600.20 → 1603.60] New drivers will be required for floppy disks.
[1604.18 → 1608.80] So if you were still using a floppy disk, you might want to stick with Windows 7 or Windows 8.
[1609.52 → 1614.14] Cortana will only be available in the US, UK, China, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain at launch.
[1614.24 → 1616.04] So Canada is getting no love.
[1616.08 → 1620.96] Although that's not necessarily something that upgrades lose, since it's not like they had Cortana anyway.
[1621.62 → 1626.24] Watching DVDs will require separate playback software.
[1626.24 → 1629.04] So that's something that they've been including for quite some time.
[1629.04 → 1632.36] And looks like will no longer be included.
[1632.50 → 1635.14] With that said, I don't watch a ton of DVDs on my computer.
[1635.26 → 1642.06] In fact, most of the computers that I mostly care about these days are portable ones.
[1642.24 → 1643.86] And I don't even have DVD drives in them.
[1643.92 → 1646.86] In fact, a lot of people are building desktops without DVD drives in them.
[1646.86 → 1653.86] Mine actually has a DVD drive that plays CDs, DVDs, HD DVDs, and Blu-rays.
[1654.16 → 1656.42] So I am equipped for any optical media.
[1656.96 → 1662.72] But the last time I used it was when I convinced myself I was going to play Alice Madness Returns.
[1662.72 → 1664.12] And then I never got around to it.
[1664.18 → 1668.70] And then I eventually pulled it out of the drive because I was sick of it spinning up every time I turned on my computer and got annoyed.
[1669.24 → 1670.26] So there you go.
[1670.88 → 1672.16] Maybe you use a DVD drive.
[1672.16 → 1673.16] I personally don't.
[1673.84 → 1675.04] What else we got here?
[1675.44 → 1681.56] Windows Hello biometric passwords will need an infrared camera for facial recognition or a supported fingerprint reader.
[1682.12 → 1686.84] And Xbox Music and Xbox Video streaming apps will be constrained by region-based licenses.
[1687.92 → 1688.40] Pro...
[1688.40 → 1689.86] Oh, this is something very interesting.
[1690.40 → 1694.38] Pro and Enterprise Editions will be able to defer updates.
[1694.38 → 1697.46] So that is to say they'll be able to say, yeah, no, I'm not ready yet.
[1697.48 → 1698.36] I'll take an update later.
[1699.08 → 1705.48] Windows 10, the normal one for like normal people, home people, will not have that option.
[1706.26 → 1709.92] Updates will be downloaded and installed automatically once they're available.
[1710.10 → 1718.94] Now, a big part of me is upset about that because from a productivity standpoint, that can be super-duper annoying.
[1718.94 → 1725.34] And a big part of me is upset about that because I don't like someone telling me how to use my computer.
[1725.64 → 1728.70] But a big part of me kind of goes, you know what, they're right.
[1729.54 → 1732.12] Because how often is it?
[1732.34 → 1733.04] If you guys are...
[1733.04 → 1733.38] You know what?
[1733.58 → 1736.30] Let's draw a pull the crap out of this too because this is kind of a big deal.
[1736.66 → 1737.92] How often is it?
[1737.92 → 1745.28] And I want to hear from the guys who do like on the side or professional tech work for like family or friends or in a store.
[1747.40 → 1749.30] So Windows updates.
[1752.78 → 1753.22] Mandatory.
[1754.26 → 1755.88] Yay or nay.
[1758.52 → 1759.02] Yay.
[1759.58 → 1760.14] Nay.
[1760.14 → 1760.28] Yay.
[1760.28 → 1772.78] How many of you guys have a machine brought into your shop or given to you that's like, oh, it's really slow, and it's got lots of viruses.
[1773.78 → 1784.98] And you kind of sit there and go, well, gee, maybe if you'd allowed your computer to install an update once in the last, I don't know, four years, you wouldn't be having this problem.
[1785.46 → 1789.26] Because it's not necessarily about you.
[1789.26 → 1792.66] It's about most of the users out there.
[1792.80 → 1808.12] And if Windows updates being rolled out more quickly means that it's less easy for malware to propagate and for computers to be compromised, is that not good for us all as a whole?
[1808.38 → 1812.38] I understand that bandwidth constraints are a big problem for some people.
[1812.92 → 1813.72] And I get that.
[1814.16 → 1816.32] But, yeah, Geez, I don't know.
[1816.36 → 1818.50] It looks like you guys are pretty divided on this as well.
[1818.50 → 1822.66] With 47% of you, 48% figuring yay.
[1822.92 → 1824.10] You know, let's make them mandatory.
[1824.32 → 1825.90] 39% of you saying nay.
[1826.24 → 1830.28] And 13% of you all agreeing with each other that surfing is cool.
[1830.28 → 1831.28] So, yeah.
[1831.28 → 1832.20] So, yeah.
[1832.88 → 1838.06] I wish that I could kind of go on a tirade now and say, this is the right thing.
[1838.14 → 1839.02] This is the answer.
[1839.24 → 1841.12] And they've got it wrong, or they've got it right.
[1841.22 → 1843.98] But I don't have a clear answer.
[1843.98 → 1862.78] One thing that I do know is that, you know, as a professional organization, like here at work, you know, as a pro user, I might pay a little extra for a pro license to not have to, you know, just have our computers randomly install updates and shut down or whatever the case may be.
[1862.78 → 1864.96] So, gee, man.
[1865.18 → 1865.76] I don't know.
[1866.84 → 1868.32] SSDs continue to get cheaper.
[1868.76 → 1871.60] This was posted on the forum by E. Condo.
[1871.82 → 1873.36] Let me go ahead and post the link here.
[1875.02 → 1881.36] SanDisk has a 2TB SSD for $1,000.
[1881.36 → 1885.52] Now, 2TB SSDs are not necessarily the newest thing in the world.
[1885.60 → 1891.82] In fact, we were talking on WAN Show about a 6TB SSD not that long ago.
[1892.88 → 1897.94] 2TB for $1,000 means $0.50 per gig.
[1898.38 → 1901.94] And I remember, everyone wanted that $1 per gig mark.
[1902.00 → 1903.12] That was what everyone wanted.
[1903.46 → 1906.30] And then it happened and then SSDs exploded and went mainstream.
[1906.30 → 1913.16] The fact that we're seeing this now, if I'm a hard drive maker, boy, am I afraid.
[1913.58 → 1921.18] Because Moore's Law dictates that this is going to be half the price in, I believe it's a year.
[1921.32 → 1924.94] So every, what is it, every year we double the transistor density or blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1925.34 → 1932.22] So this should be half the price in a year, maybe even cheaper once SanDisk has a little bit of competition here.
[1932.22 → 1935.32] That is incredible.
[1935.68 → 1938.64] Because it's not that everyone needs a 2TB boot drive.
[1938.70 → 1941.02] In fact, I don't think everyone needs a 2TB boot drive.
[1941.08 → 1945.82] And I think that the amount of storage that people need as a boot drive is going to,
[1946.02 → 1950.68] or it's going to intersect with the speed at which SSDs are increasing in capacity.
[1950.92 → 1952.16] So it's going to happen even sooner.
[1952.64 → 1954.82] SSDs aren't going to have to catch up to hard drives.
[1955.10 → 1956.66] So people are going to need their bulk storage.
[1956.78 → 1960.58] They're going to have a NAS, or they're going to have a Dropbox account that they pay way too much for.
[1960.58 → 1961.66] Or whatever else the case may be.
[1961.72 → 1963.36] They're going to have their bulk magnetic storage.
[1963.88 → 1969.34] And then they're only going to need, I think, 512 gigs are lots.
[1969.60 → 1972.88] And 1TB is as much as we'll ever need.
[1972.98 → 1974.38] And don't quote me on that.
[1974.46 → 1975.28] I know.
[1975.68 → 1979.94] But 1TB was kind of a magic point for hard drives.
[1980.74 → 1984.38] That was like the time when people stopped caring about new hard drives.
[1984.64 → 1987.10] 1TB was a super magic time for hard drives.
[1987.10 → 1992.70] I think affordable 1TB drives is going to be a super magic time for SSDs as well.
[1992.80 → 1997.62] Because that's enough to have a handful of games installed, even if you're a gamer.
[1998.02 → 2003.50] And if you're going to start streaming games over the internet, especially for the ones where Twitch responsiveness is not that important,
[2004.04 → 2006.60] that storage space locally could become even less relevant.
[2007.82 → 2009.52] It's enough to have a lot of games installed.
[2009.60 → 2011.24] It's enough to have a fair chunk of movies.
[2011.24 → 2015.30] You can always have an external drive for some additional movies or other media.
[2016.38 → 2017.02] Wow.
[2017.62 → 2018.40] Terrifying.
[2018.66 → 2021.80] So it's the Extreme 900 portable SSD.
[2022.00 → 2024.72] It has a 1.92TB formatted size.
[2025.10 → 2027.76] There will also be 480 and 960GB versions.
[2028.32 → 2032.10] And it has a maximum performance rating of 850MB per second.
[2032.22 → 2033.66] Doesn't specify reads or writes.
[2034.00 → 2036.06] It's equipped with a USB 3.1 interface.
[2036.54 → 2039.94] And they'll have a 3-year warranty on these new drives.
[2039.94 → 2045.22] So stay tuned, guys, because anything that shows up in an external drive is going to be in an internal drive.
[2045.40 → 2051.38] And as performance continues to scale, SSDs are going to just make more and more and more sense all the time.
[2051.50 → 2056.76] And you know what's funny is because back when SSDs were still gaining traction,
[2057.34 → 2064.24] there would be every SSD video I did was just full of comments about how nobody needs an SSD, and it doesn't matter
[2064.24 → 2065.68] and don't you have two seconds to wait?
[2065.68 → 2071.58] And now people are finally, mostly clued in to the fact that it's way more than two seconds.
[2072.00 → 2073.78] And yes, it's worth it.
[2074.20 → 2075.82] The trade-off is worth it.
[2076.02 → 2077.12] It's huge.
[2077.42 → 2083.50] It could be 30 seconds when you're launching an application depending on what else you've got going on your computer at a time.
[2083.96 → 2085.94] And that could be 30 seconds now.
[2086.02 → 2087.68] And then 30 seconds a minute from now.
[2088.20 → 2089.02] It's a big deal.
[2089.02 → 2093.70] So, yeah, I'm a huge SSD advocate as you guys probably know at this point.
[2095.30 → 2099.92] There's a USB drive with USB type A and type C.
[2100.36 → 2108.76] Although I actually hadn't looked at the article for this one yet because I assumed that I knew what we were talking about.
[2109.76 → 2110.52] Here we go.
[2110.52 → 2114.66] I assumed I knew what we were talking about, and I thought it was something from another company,
[2114.78 → 2118.46] but apparently this is SanDisk showing off one at Computer.
[2118.70 → 2122.16] This is the way that USB type C is going to go mainstream,
[2122.58 → 2126.56] having it also on drives that feature USB type A.
[2126.64 → 2129.32] So you have that compatibility with something like a MacBook,
[2129.32 → 2136.34] as well as with the whatever other computer you own that obviously doesn't have a type C connector
[2136.34 → 2140.86] since you probably don't own both a Chromebook, Pixel, latest gen, and a MacBook.
[2141.40 → 2144.88] So a way to actually get data onto it in order to put onto your MacBook.
[2146.02 → 2151.52] This is going to be really common, I think, until USB type C just goes completely ubiquitous
[2151.52 → 2154.46] and all the other connectors pretty much go away.
[2154.46 → 2160.86] But one of the things that I'm happy to see is not everyone is diving headfirst into just USB type C devices.
[2160.98 → 2164.20] No, that seems to be mostly Apple that wants to do that
[2164.20 → 2169.50] because as much as type C has been vetted in a laboratory somewhere,
[2170.04 → 2172.48] it has not been field tested yet.
[2172.96 → 2177.14] And before I have a bunch of motherboards and laptops that only have type C connectors on them,
[2177.14 → 2180.86] I would love to have a little bit of experience actually using the thing.
[2180.86 → 2184.44] All right.
[2185.14 → 2188.24] So Intel has been showing off Bradwell.
[2188.48 → 2190.72] This was posted by Mule.
[2191.16 → 2192.90] Let's go ahead and copy the link here.
[2194.12 → 2198.50] So Bradwell for desktops, we've already seen Bradwell in the Core M.
[2198.64 → 2201.38] So we've got Bradwell for mobile devices already.
[2201.82 → 2205.62] But of course, Bradwell for desktops is kind of a big deal.
[2206.04 → 2207.22] Or is it?
[2207.22 → 2214.84] So Tom's Hardware has got their review up of the 5775C and the 5675C.
[2215.32 → 2217.50] And basically what it comes down to is...
[2217.50 → 2218.38] Dang it, Tom's.
[2219.80 → 2220.86] Can you not, please?
[2221.88 → 2224.22] Basically what it comes down to is,
[2224.30 → 2229.12] yup, performance has not really changed a lot
[2229.12 → 2234.38] in terms of, you know, gaming with a discrete GPU.
[2234.38 → 2237.22] I sure wish this would work a little better for me here.
[2237.68 → 2245.78] But the onboard graphics looks like it has pretty much killed any possibility of...
[2245.78 → 2247.32] Oh, for crying out loud.
[2247.70 → 2255.38] Any possibility of discrete grade low-end graphics cards existing pretty well ever again.
[2255.76 → 2258.38] So I'm going to make sure I'm on the right dang page here.
[2258.44 → 2258.86] There we go.
[2258.86 → 2261.78] So let's have a look at these performance numbers from Tom's.
[2261.96 → 2263.20] Good guys over there as well.
[2263.28 → 2266.06] Actually, same ownership as a non-tech these days.
[2266.62 → 2267.76] Look at that.
[2267.86 → 2270.12] So that's Bios hock Infinite at 1080p.
[2270.54 → 2271.76] Low settings, mind you.
[2271.82 → 2272.60] No antialiasing.
[2273.24 → 2277.18] Running at 86 frames per second average.
[2277.18 → 2280.76] On the Core i5.
[2281.40 → 2282.56] That's incredible.
[2283.20 → 2290.70] I mean, AMD was king of the integrated graphics ever since they launched the APU concept.
[2291.26 → 2299.24] But Intel, quietly, slowly but surely, has been improving the integrated graphics on their mainstream chips as well.
[2299.34 → 2302.04] To the point where now, holy cow.
[2302.04 → 2308.78] If I'm AMD, I'm a little bit scared because people ask me what CPU to buy all the time.
[2309.32 → 2317.26] And if they're using integrated graphics for some light gaming, or it's like a computer at grandma's house and the grandkids come over once in a while.
[2317.42 → 2323.26] Maybe they, you know, bring a game, and they're staying over for the weekend, and they don't want it to just completely not run at all.
[2323.58 → 2324.90] I'd say get an APU.
[2324.90 → 2325.90] Wow.
[2327.78 → 2339.98] If they don't have that going for them anymore, that is deeply worrying if you're into AMD continuing to make sense on the low-end onboard graphics scene.
[2340.08 → 2346.80] Now, I can't find it in the Tom's article right now, but there's actually some pretty good die shots out there of Bradwell.
[2346.80 → 2352.20] And how, like, literally half, half of the die is not CPU.
[2352.38 → 2360.26] Which should make sense given that we know that Intel can cram, you know, eight cores in an enthusiast-grade CPU these days.
[2360.32 → 2364.62] So the fact that they're only putting four on the mainstream ones means they probably had a lot of room left over.
[2366.40 → 2367.96] Here's a scary thought too.
[2368.46 → 2368.96] Oh, wow.
[2369.04 → 2370.08] Imagine this for a moment.
[2370.08 → 2378.70] If Intel actually did, like, a dedicated chip for gamers, where it had no onboard graphics, but it actually slugged.
[2378.72 → 2379.90] Because AMD's done this before.
[2380.04 → 2385.98] On the FM2 platform, I believe, or FM2 Plus, they did nonplus.
[2386.06 → 2387.36] They did just CPUs.
[2387.76 → 2393.68] Imagine if Intel did that, where they took something like a Bradwell or the upcoming Skylike,
[2393.98 → 2397.66] and they just chopped off the GPU and did a pure gaming skew.
[2397.66 → 2408.76] It would cost them half as much, obviously, plus R&D, but the actual material cost would be half what the one with the GPU built into it would be.
[2409.46 → 2410.64] How scary is that?
[2410.74 → 2418.02] If Intel could deliver 4790k performance to anyone who's planning to put a graphics card in for half the price, for $149.99.
[2418.94 → 2425.72] I don't even know what AMD would sell at that point, but I don't think Intel's really that into putting AMD out of business anyway,
[2425.72 → 2429.88] so I guess it's really a non-issue.
[2430.34 → 2436.56] Speaking of non-issues, hopefully you guys don't have an issue with us doing our sponsors for the week!
[2436.92 → 2444.80] So sponsor number one is lynda.com, and if you guys don't know what lynda.com is, then you probably don't watch this show enough.
[2445.08 → 2446.40] So shame on you.
[2446.64 → 2450.50] And if you do know what lynda.com is, but you're not using it, then I will refresh your memory.
[2450.50 → 2453.14] It's used by millions of people around the world. Isn't that incredible?
[2453.72 → 2464.08] Like, how massive an online video education thing can be, and how Google can't even figure out how to make YouTube profitable with so much educational content on it?
[2464.34 → 2472.62] I mean, I guess Lynda differentiates by, well, curating the content a lot and ensuring that the courses are taught by industry experts that you can trust,
[2472.80 → 2477.60] by making sure the production values are good, by focusing on particular verticals.
[2477.60 → 2480.52] So, like, you're not going to go on lynda.com to learn how to make a bead necklace.
[2480.86 → 2487.70] You can go on lynda.com to learn about business, learn about Adobe applications like Photoshop or Premiere, so video editing,
[2488.22 → 2494.24] learning things like office productivity suites if you're looking to, you know, get a new job or get back in the workforce.
[2494.24 → 2501.84] So, I guess it differentiates itself in that way, but plans start at $25 a month, and what's cool about it is for 10 days,
[2501.92 → 2505.92] you can get a free all-you-can-eat trial and find out if lynda.com is right for you.
[2506.00 → 2509.14] So, visit lynda.com slash Sancho. I always point at the wrong side.
[2509.50 → 2514.24] lynda.com slash Sancho to join today and start learning.
[2514.24 → 2522.22] Learning. Our second sponsor, and these guys have been with us forever through the good and the bad, Dollar Shave Club.
[2522.54 → 2527.48] They let us do pretty much anything in our sponsor spots. Maybe today I won't even talk about shaving at all.
[2527.72 → 2533.72] I'll just talk about butt wiping, which would actually be on topic, because they do have their one-wipe Charlie's Peppermint
[2533.72 → 2537.56] set of butt wipes for men. No, but seriously, Dollar Shave Club, we've done, like, some crazy stuff.
[2537.56 → 2544.94] We did a how-to basic parody, which they were just like, wow, that was pretty out there. Maybe it would be best if you didn't do that again.
[2545.06 → 2549.76] So, maybe I won't do anything that crazy today. I'll just tell you guys what the point of Dollar Shave Club is.
[2550.20 → 2556.98] It's the turn-your-brain-off-and-still-look-good service for taking care of your face.
[2557.06 → 2564.92] Once a month, for just a few bucks, you get razors, you can get their aftershave, you can get their Dr. Carver shave butter,
[2564.92 → 2569.96] which goes on clear, so you can see what you're doing, and you can be using a fresh razor every week,
[2570.08 → 2574.68] instead of, like, just dragging a dull, you know, scrap of metal across your face,
[2574.82 → 2579.92] or worrying about the hassle of remembering to buy razors, or specifically going out for them when you need one,
[2580.20 → 2585.30] and buying them at a store, where hilariously, at least here in Canada, and presumably in the States,
[2585.42 → 2589.54] since this is one of the things that Dollar Shave Club has in their kit for how to pitch Dollar Shave Club,
[2589.54 → 2594.54] since a lot of stores put the razors behind lock and key, since they are such a theft magnet,
[2594.62 → 2595.96] because they're too expensive.
[2596.50 → 2599.94] But with Dollar Shave Club, you don't have to worry about other people stealing them,
[2600.02 → 2602.46] causing you to have to pay more, because they keep everything in a warehouse,
[2602.62 → 2604.74] and ship it to you when you need it.
[2604.98 → 2609.12] So head over to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus to start shaving time and shaving money.
[2609.32 → 2612.10] Which leads us to our last one, FreshBooks.
[2612.10 → 2615.96] And Luke's not here to try and tie all of these sponsors together, which is fine,
[2616.02 → 2618.68] because I don't think FreshBooks is really that related to Dollar Shave Club.
[2618.92 → 2623.28] It's more for people who run their own business, whether you're someone who needs to shave,
[2623.44 → 2629.76] or someone like me, who, like, could, you know, throw a Dollar Shave Club razor across their face once every three days,
[2629.82 → 2631.52] and you guys would never know the difference.
[2632.06 → 2639.10] FreshBooks is for small business owners, who want to use a solution that lets them spend their time
[2639.10 → 2644.72] actually doing work and making money, instead of figuring out how to account for the money,
[2644.90 → 2646.14] and actually get paid.
[2646.22 → 2651.44] So it's a cloud-based accounting tool that lets you do things like log your hours for a job,
[2651.84 → 2657.40] send bills out to your clients for the job, see that they've actually received it.
[2657.46 → 2661.28] So if they're like, oh, yeah, gee, sorry, I didn't pay, oh, I didn't get it, blah, blah, blah.
[2661.36 → 2661.76] No.
[2663.16 → 2667.58] No, no, they let you take care of that, and they actually allow you to bill online.
[2667.58 → 2672.86] So instead of running around dealing with paper this and, you know, writing down that,
[2672.96 → 2676.50] use FreshBooks to keep yourself organized, to keep your clients paying you,
[2676.58 → 2679.86] so you can spend your time doing what makes you money,
[2680.04 → 2683.02] instead of spending your time in front of your computer at the end of the day,
[2683.30 → 2687.78] trying to sort all this stuff out when you're just exhausted and would rather just sleep.
[2688.12 → 2690.30] So use a solution that makes you feel like a boss.

[2694.16 → 2699.16] And don't forget to enter when in how did you hear about us.
[2699.16 → 2705.14] So let's move on to our next topic, which I straight up don't know what it is,
[2705.18 → 2707.84] because I actually forgot to look at what our next topic is.
[2707.92 → 2715.10] Oh, this is a really crappy one, but it's actually related to something that we've been talking about a fair bit on the show lately.
[2715.48 → 2717.80] I was posted by Exit on the forum.
[2717.94 → 2719.44] I'm going to go ahead and post this in Twitch.
[2719.44 → 2723.50] But the headline here is actually kind of heartbreaking.
[2723.92 → 2725.96] It's an article from Amazon.com.
[2726.52 → 2728.44] Disney terminated your job.
[2728.88 → 2732.56] By the way, can you please train your replacement?
[2732.92 → 2737.20] So last take after layoff at Disney, train foreign replacements.
[2737.58 → 2742.46] So yeah, pretty much employees, some of which have worked at Disney for 10 years.
[2742.46 → 2750.16] And there's a really heartbreaking story about one guy that actually had a performance review from his direct supervisor
[2750.16 → 2758.38] after he'd been told by that person's boss that he was being terminated and had to train his cheaper import replacement
[2758.38 → 2764.62] that said that he was being recommended for a raise and that he had saved the company a ton of money.
[2764.80 → 2767.54] And it was like a really positive performance review.
[2767.54 → 2775.12] So anyway, data systems employees, they monitored the computers in industrial buildings nearby,
[2775.30 → 2779.76] making sure millions of ticket sales, store purchases, and hotel reservations went through without a hitch.
[2780.28 → 2785.62] Some of them thought the meetings with their manager had been called since they were receiving a bonus for their stellar work.
[2786.06 → 2789.62] In actuality, 250 employees were called in and told they would be laid off.
[2789.70 → 2795.02] The jobs were transferred to people on temporary visas for highly skilled technical work,
[2795.02 → 2797.72] brought in by an outsourcing firm.
[2798.12 → 2799.84] The jobs were...
[2799.84 → 2805.38] Oh, so over the next three months, some employees were required to train their replacements to do the job that they lost.
[2805.72 → 2807.90] So for the first month, their replacement shadows them.
[2807.98 → 2809.70] For the second month, they do it side by side.
[2809.74 → 2815.48] And for the third month, they basically don't do anything and just kind of watch their job being done by their new person.
[2815.48 → 2819.76] So if they remained for the 90 days to train their replacement,
[2819.90 → 2824.88] they were offered a stay bonus of 10% of the severance pay on top of their severance pay.
[2828.88 → 2831.48] Yeah, so this is...
[2831.48 → 2833.98] So there are a couple of things happening.
[2834.10 → 2836.42] Number one is outsourcing is still very much real.
[2836.42 → 2844.16] And number two is the crazy thing about this is its nothing compared to when Disney automates that job.
[2845.02 → 2846.58] Who knows how long from now?
[2846.62 → 2853.32] I mean, we talked about the McDonald's restaurant that is opening with no employees whatsoever on Wan show.
[2853.44 → 2854.76] A while ago, blah, I shouldn't say whatsoever.
[2854.92 → 2857.84] They have a skeleton crew to oversee the machines,
[2858.02 → 2861.92] but everything from taking orders to making burgers to delivering the burger to the customer
[2861.92 → 2864.46] is going to be handled by robots.
[2864.46 → 2867.70] And what that is going to mean.
[2867.80 → 2870.08] Because, you know, I got to look at something like that as,
[2870.94 → 2873.82] you know, like is McDonald's just shooting themselves in the foot?
[2874.16 → 2877.14] I mean, who eats at McDonald's if not like...
[2877.14 → 2879.10] And no offence if you eat at McDonald's.
[2879.12 → 2880.58] I eat at McDonald's from time to time too.
[2880.66 → 2881.60] Like it's not like...
[2881.60 → 2886.26] But I mean, who relies on McDonald's if not your lower income people?
[2887.02 → 2888.74] So, and like I...
[2888.74 → 2893.60] Actually, my badminton doubles partner was a longtime McDonald's employee.
[2893.60 → 2896.52] He ate like almost every meal at McDonald's.
[2896.82 → 2898.34] So you're going to go...
[2898.34 → 2899.44] So you're McDonald's.
[2899.50 → 2902.68] And you're going to basically not just take away jobs and income from,
[2902.76 → 2908.12] but you're going to piss off all these lower income people who presumably have families and friends
[2908.12 → 2911.80] who, you know, maybe there's a couple lower income people there as well.
[2911.84 → 2915.16] You're going to go and piss off all these people for the sake of saving a couple bucks.
[2915.30 → 2916.92] Who's going to eat at your restaurant anymore?
[2916.92 → 2918.74] And maybe I'm wrong.
[2919.22 → 2920.74] Maybe I'm completely wrong.
[2920.86 → 2926.32] And maybe McDonald's's business is going to completely take off because the robots are faster,
[2926.72 → 2929.48] more sanitary, they make fewer errors.
[2930.04 → 2931.26] I don't know.
[2931.44 → 2931.82] I don't know.
[2931.98 → 2932.92] It's just...
[2932.92 → 2937.04] I don't see myself ever doing this.
[2937.04 → 2943.82] I also am not in a position where I'm running, you know, a huge multi-billion dollar multinational corporation
[2943.82 → 2949.24] where every penny I save literally results in, you know, tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.
[2949.58 → 2960.04] But I like having a team of people that's, you know, paid a living wage and is happy with the work that they're doing.
[2960.16 → 2961.18] And I just...
[2961.18 → 2961.92] I don't know.
[2961.98 → 2962.38] It just...
[2962.38 → 2965.02] It grosses me out to see stuff like this.
[2965.02 → 2968.62] Um, speaking of...
[2968.62 → 2969.22] Oh, man.
[2969.34 → 2971.24] So, fully automated.
[2971.46 → 2973.64] This was posted by Boohoo on the forum.
[2974.34 → 2980.98] And Asus has rolled out the first fully automated graphics card production line.
[2981.36 → 2988.18] And this fascinates me from a technological standpoint but ties very well into this last topic.
[2988.76 → 2992.92] And we've got the original article here, one of them, from Tom's Hardware.
[2992.92 → 2996.38] I've actually asked Asus to give me a lot more details on this.
[2996.46 → 2996.52] And I would...
[2996.52 → 3001.18] I would actually love to get my hands on one of the graphics cards made with it.
[3001.26 → 3008.06] Because I don't know if you guys know this, but graphics cards up till now still had some hand soldering.
[3008.06 → 3011.82] And I believe some of the QA was actually done by hand.
[3011.82 → 3023.30] So, their new production method is an industry first and should deliver more reliable, higher quality graphics cards than before by completely taking out the human element.
[3023.30 → 3026.78] So, hopefully this is going to go ahead and load a larger image at some point here.
[3027.60 → 3028.14] Droopily-doop.
[3028.20 → 3028.70] There you go.
[3029.12 → 3032.74] Look how beautiful that PCB is.
[3033.56 → 3035.30] So, the like...
[3036.16 → 3037.96] The geeky tech in me goes,
[3038.30 → 3039.16] Holy cow.
[3039.72 → 3041.48] That is specific.
[3041.68 → 3044.54] I mean, it is so clean.
[3045.18 → 3046.26] Everything is perfect.
[3046.26 → 3053.10] But Asus isn't going to give you a discount on it, I'm sure.
[3053.80 → 3062.52] And, I mean, as much as, you know, some people might go, well, you know, soldering components on graphics cards at the last stage of production is a crappy job.
[3062.68 → 3064.26] It was a job for someone.
[3065.04 → 3066.64] And they do not have it anymore.
[3066.64 → 3068.40] So, what's...
[3068.40 → 3069.62] I mean, but this is like...
[3069.62 → 3070.64] So, again, we're...
[3071.38 → 3073.18] My inner geek kind of goes,
[3073.26 → 3074.22] Holy crap, that's awesome.
[3074.56 → 3080.62] Because one of the things that you can achieve here is less oxidation on the graphics card.
[3080.72 → 3084.48] Because you can actually produce them in an environment without oxygen.
[3087.06 → 3087.82] So, what?
[3088.02 → 3090.38] So, my graphics card could last for 20 years?
[3091.40 → 3093.16] That seems like a pretty good thing.
[3093.36 → 3094.10] I don't know, man.
[3094.10 → 3103.02] So, there's some speculation that this could lead to longer warranties, better reliability, like all this cool stuff.
[3103.30 → 3109.42] So, the first card produced using Auto Extreme was the 20th anniversary edition card.
[3109.56 → 3114.46] So, I've actually asked Asus for a sample so we can check this out in person.
[3118.94 → 3122.40] So, there's a perfect thread on the forum.
[3122.40 → 3124.64] This was posted by Mech77.
[3124.96 → 3126.96] I'm going to go ahead and post this here.
[3131.04 → 3131.44] Hmm.
[3132.02 → 3132.62] All right.
[3134.20 → 3134.64] Sorry.
[3134.92 → 3136.96] I'm a little slower paced than usual.
[3137.12 → 3140.98] I'm trying to keep up here without my lovely co-host.
[3140.98 → 3148.08] But, basically, there's a YouTube video to watch about DirectX 12's multi-GPU rendering.
[3148.24 → 3150.66] So, there's a demo here from Oxide Games.
[3152.14 → 3153.80] And you guys should definitely check that out.
[3153.86 → 3156.88] I'll post that link in the thread that goes up after WAN show.
[3156.88 → 3165.34] But, so, currently, the way that multi-GPUs are combined is that each GPU, in a dual card config, takes turns rendering each frame.
[3165.34 → 3171.90] And back in the early days of multi-GPU, Crossfire and SLI, it was actually done a little bit differently.
[3171.90 → 3174.46] So, you could have alternate frame rendering.
[3174.46 → 3176.06] And that was usually what would work best.
[3176.06 → 3177.90] But, sometimes, you could do tiled stuff.
[3177.90 → 3179.30] And there were actually other modes.
[3179.30 → 3184.76] But, the way that that works is both GPUs have to be nearly identical, run at the same clock speed.
[3184.76 → 3193.66] And have the same data in their video memory, resulting in redundancies and limitations in terms of which cards can be used.
[3193.66 → 3195.56] And how the resources can be used.
[3195.56 → 3205.36] So, something that's a huge confusion point, and that Nvidia and AMD, frankly, don't help people with, is that if you buy a card like a GTX 690.
[3205.60 → 3205.86] Okay?
[3205.94 → 3210.56] Which is pretty much two 670 slash 680 sort of cards.
[3211.30 → 3212.56] It'll call itself...
[3213.12 → 3213.52] What's...
[3213.52 → 3213.94] Oh, crap.
[3214.02 → 3214.44] 690?
[3214.56 → 3215.02] What was that?
[3215.04 → 3215.96] A 6-gig card?
[3218.78 → 3220.08] Or was it a 4-gig card?
[3220.10 → 3220.32] Whatever.
[3220.42 → 3220.76] I don't care.
[3221.20 → 3222.62] I think it was a 4-gig card.
[3222.62 → 3227.48] So, it'll call itself a 4-gig card, because there's technically 4 gigabytes of GPU memory on board.
[3227.48 → 3232.66] But, actually, usably, there's only 2 gigs, because it has to have two copies.
[3232.66 → 3236.22] It has to have two copies of the data in memory.
[3236.22 → 3238.46] And so, yes, that was a 4-gig card.
[3238.46 → 3245.70] So, now, each GPU can render only a specific part of the frame.
[3246.18 → 3251.16] And video memory can be stacked, as each card is actually working on a separate aspect of the frame.
[3251.16 → 3256.02] So, it's up to the developer to implement this, which means pretty much...
[3256.02 → 3261.34] And the video actually shows an integrated GPU being used in conjunction with a dedicated GPU.
[3262.04 → 3262.72] So, here we go.
[3262.94 → 3269.20] So, which means that, in my mind, we're pretty much not going to see this implemented very well, if at all.
[3269.20 → 3273.40] But, it's a very cool piece of technology for the future.
[3273.40 → 3274.40] I'm just trying to find...
[3274.40 → 3275.90] Oh, bloody hell.
[3275.96 → 3276.44] Well, whatever.
[3277.10 → 3281.78] You can check out this video, and I'll definitely link it if you want to get a little bit more detail in terms of how it works.
[3282.46 → 3283.46] Very cool tech.
[3283.94 → 3293.20] Not sure if it'll have any practical use, just because if you guys already look at how broken, established stuff like SLI that's been around for years, that NVIDIA is actively working on...
[3293.20 → 3298.20] You look at how well that's working in some modern games, and you kind of go, oh, crap.
[3299.32 → 3303.66] Because, quite frankly, is NVIDIA going to have any incentive to help a game developer implement this?
[3304.16 → 3304.48] No.
[3305.02 → 3306.22] Is AMD going to want to do it?
[3306.68 → 3307.12] Maybe.
[3308.14 → 3309.46] But, hard to say.
[3309.46 → 3309.50] Okay.
[3312.58 → 3315.04] This I actually talked about a little bit.
[3315.80 → 3316.68] Here we go.
[3318.28 → 3325.92] This I actually talked about a little bit in my 980 Ti video, but this could be a big problem.
[3326.10 → 3327.56] This is definitely...
[3327.56 → 3330.28] This is from TechPowerUp here, and was originally posted...
[3330.28 → 3332.42] Let me just grab that OP here.
[3332.94 → 3335.90] Was originally posted on the forum by Big St rooms.
[3335.90 → 3340.28] This could be a big problem for AMD over the next little bit here.
[3340.36 → 3347.12] I don't know if you guys are going to remember this, but I'm not even sure if I remember this correctly.
[3347.46 → 3351.12] I'm trying to remember who had the DirectX 11 advantage.
[3351.30 → 3352.46] I want to say AMD.
[3353.50 → 3356.84] First DirectX 11 card.
[3357.44 → 3359.36] I want to say it was 6000 series.
[3360.04 → 3361.98] I really don't remember.
[3363.78 → 3364.56] I suck.
[3364.64 → 3365.20] Well, whatever.
[3365.20 → 3367.20] The point is...
[3367.98 → 3373.78] Having an advantage in terms of what level of DirectX is supported by your cards.
[3373.86 → 3376.94] Maybe AMD was doing 11.1 first or something like that.
[3377.26 → 3378.16] Someone's going to correct me.
[3378.28 → 3379.06] Thank you in advance.
[3379.62 → 3388.38] Having an advantage in terms of your DirectX support level can be a huge selling point for gamers.
[3388.38 → 3399.00] Whether it actually translates into something meaningful for the person who owns that card that's the first one to support DirectX 9 is highly debatable.
[3399.00 → 3406.58] I mean, I know AMD had an advantage back in the DirectX 9 days when it was the 9000 series versus the FX series.
[3406.58 → 3416.22] But that was a whole other issue because not only were the FX 5800 series not even properly DirectX, they were just kind of sucked in general.
[3416.22 → 3422.56] So, ATI was selling a lot more cards at the time just on the sheer merit of their performance in DirectX 8 games at the time.
[3422.56 → 3424.32] And that's a big issue.
[3424.46 → 3431.14] Whether there's a real advantage to owning that first DirectX 12.1 card is yet to be seen.
[3431.24 → 3437.70] Because DirectX 12.1 capable games might show up and a GTX 980 could look like a joke.
[3437.70 → 3445.06] Even running it with those features on, and actually we need, you know, 10,000 80s in order to really get the most out of it anyway.
[3445.62 → 3449.54] But that will sell gamers on games.
[3449.88 → 3456.18] And DirectX 12 is looking like, yes, we'll have support on pretty much any DirectX 10 card or newer.
[3457.14 → 3459.50] But that doesn't mean we have all the support.
[3459.82 → 3465.96] So you're going to have the low level access for game developers to get more out of the hardware.
[3466.08 → 3466.56] That's great.
[3466.56 → 3470.38] You're going to have that low CPU overhead on pretty much the entire backlog there.
[3470.64 → 3475.04] But what you won't have is some pretty cool new rendering features.
[3475.14 → 3477.60] So one of them is volume tiled resources.
[3477.80 → 3479.60] So this is an evolution of tiled resources.
[3479.74 → 3485.88] So that is basically reusing resources rather than restoring them or re-rendering them all the time.
[3485.94 → 3488.04] So this is volume tiled resources.
[3488.42 → 3491.92] Are you jumping in because you want to talk DirectX 12.1 or just in general?
[3493.64 → 3494.08] Hi.
[3494.08 → 3496.56] Are you guys doing something to me?
[3496.88 → 3497.12] Yeah.
[3497.78 → 3498.14] Oh.
[3498.46 → 3498.76] No.
[3499.28 → 3499.62] Okay.
[3499.90 → 3500.70] Oh, that was Ed.
[3500.72 → 3501.32] He said hi.
[3501.44 → 3501.88] Thanks, Ed.
[3501.88 → 3505.78] So volume tiled resources.
[3505.78 → 3512.20] And this loads the entire texture to memory, not only just along X and Y axes, but also a third dimension.
[3512.38 → 3514.42] So this is like a performance improvement.
[3514.42 → 3519.24] So while it's a rendering technique, it could be something that just straight up improves performance.
[3519.66 → 3520.96] Conservative rasterization.
[3520.96 → 3527.66] So that is a means of drawing polygons with additional pixels that makes it easier for two polygons to interact with each other.
[3527.78 → 3535.22] Like, you know how, like, the character's, you know, shoulder armour will just, like, dip into their shoulder from time to time?
[3535.22 → 3536.88] This could help with stuff like that.
[3537.14 → 3542.32] And raster ordered views, which is a means to optimize raster loads in the order in which they appear in an object.
[3542.92 → 3545.64] So practical applications include improved shadows.
[3546.72 → 3548.44] So these are only going to be supported.
[3548.52 → 3549.04] Are you joining me?
[3549.24 → 3549.56] Yeah.
[3549.56 → 3550.14] Yeah, sure.
[3550.24 → 3550.60] Come on in.
[3550.72 → 3551.82] We've got Nick joining us.
[3551.86 → 3559.94] So these are only features that are going to work on cards that support DirectX 12 underscore, like, feature level one.
[3560.14 → 3565.28] So that is Maxwell, not 750 Ti is my understanding.
[3565.42 → 3570.70] So second gen Maxwell, 960, 970, 980, and Titan X, a 980 Ti.
[3570.70 → 3580.42] And then AMD's Tonga, and then presumably Fiji, which is a card that's going to be inaccessible to most people thanks to its price anyway.
[3580.68 → 3584.12] Because what we don't know is how much it costs, but what we do know is that it's not cheap.
[3584.56 → 3584.64] Right.
[3585.06 → 3587.80] So what do you get?
[3588.26 → 3590.88] Do you want to talk 65-core smartphone?
[3591.38 → 3592.00] Yeah, yeah.
[3592.04 → 3593.64] Let's talk about the 65-core smartphone.
[3593.78 → 3594.96] I thought this was pretty funny.
[3594.96 → 3595.04] Okay.
[3596.42 → 3606.20] So Intel created a Mach 65-core smartphone where one of their principal engineers, Francois Piedmont.
[3606.32 → 3607.92] You're actually, it's a little bit off frame here.
[3608.02 → 3608.16] Okay.
[3608.30 → 3608.82] I'll move over.
[3608.92 → 3609.50] There we go.
[3609.70 → 3610.16] That's cozy.
[3610.48 → 3611.52] Francois Piedmont.
[3612.90 → 3619.18] He made remarks during an Intel benchmarking session at Computer on Thursday that this is the world's first 65-core smartphone.
[3619.18 → 3620.64] He said, more than a server.
[3620.64 → 3627.06] But what it really was the what was it, 4-core Oenone, is it?
[3627.26 → 3627.42] Yeah.
[3627.68 → 3632.76] And then a 61-core Leon that he essentially just taped to the back of it.
[3633.74 → 3640.34] So kind of taking pot shots at the competition a little bit after the whole Decachord thing from MediaTek.
[3640.68 → 3641.12] Mm-hmm.
[3641.96 → 3643.00] And you know what?
[3643.00 → 3651.32] I agree with Intel 100% that the core race on particularly mobile is really silly right now.
[3651.44 → 3654.18] And I think there's one other major smartphone maker.
[3654.32 → 3655.72] I'm trying to remember what they're called.
[3656.48 → 3657.20] What are they?
[3657.28 → 3658.30] It starts with an A.
[3659.24 → 3660.34] It starts with an A.
[3660.46 → 3663.52] They only have dual-core smartphones even though everyone else is going quad.
[3663.62 → 3664.06] Right.
[3664.34 → 3664.82] Apple.
[3664.82 → 3671.82] I think Apple also agrees that we don't need a core count race in smartphones right now.
[3672.10 → 3685.98] On PCs where we're finally getting multithreaded workloads, whether it's 3D rendering or video outputting or, you know, DirectX 12 coming and giving us finally some multi-threading awareness for games.
[3686.38 → 3690.28] On desktops, yes, multicore makes sense and has made sense for quite some time.
[3690.28 → 3695.98] In mobile, we need strong single-cores for a long time still.
[3696.56 → 3700.14] And so a 65-core smartphone would be a little silly.
[3700.36 → 3709.98] A 10-core smartphone is probably a little silly unless the strategy would be a super strong dual-core and, like, eight super low-power auxiliary cores or whatever the case may be.
[3710.08 → 3715.26] And that's kind of Intel's point, right, is that you're not going to be able to push 10 cores in a form factor for a smartphone.
[3715.26 → 3723.10] Like, it's going to be one to two cores that are doing all the work and then the other eight are just there for marketing purposes essentially.
[3723.22 → 3724.88] Just like, look at how many cores we have.
[3725.12 → 3727.44] Yeah, because there are implementations that make sense.
[3727.62 → 3731.34] Like a big, small implementation where, I mean, we've even seen this.
[3731.44 → 3735.88] Outscore processors that have, so there are four big ones and four small ones.
[3735.96 → 3739.28] So the phone can literally turn off the big ones when you're not doing anything intensive.
[3739.28 → 3744.08] And Intel has quad-core smartphone processors.
[3744.62 → 3745.94] So there's that.
[3747.24 → 3748.78] But, yeah, we don't need 10.
[3749.18 → 3752.32] And it'll be a long time, if ever, that we need more than four.
[3752.44 → 3755.86] And I should, with ever asterisk at some point, I'm sure we will.
[3757.02 → 3760.16] I don't think that'll be during the Silicon Age, though.
[3760.82 → 3765.76] Yeah, yeah, it might take something completely different to come along in the future.
[3766.40 → 3767.78] So what have we got next?
[3769.28 → 3775.54] From official Valve Steam Machine pre-orders to reach some customers October 16th.
[3775.54 → 3776.62] This was posted by Goodbyes.
[3776.94 → 3779.12] Oh, and that last one was posted by...
[3779.12 → 3779.48] Oh, shoot.
[3779.56 → 3782.30] I actually had to open the article here to see who posted it.
[3782.32 → 3783.56] Yeah, I'm not sure.
[3784.36 → 3785.66] I want to give you credit.
[3785.96 → 3786.72] Fuzzy Yellow.
[3787.34 → 3788.76] So let's go ahead and pull this one up.
[3788.80 → 3791.10] This one, the original article here is from Polygon.
[3791.10 → 3795.48] And it looks like official Steam Machines are actually a thing.
[3795.48 → 3802.06] But this is not the kind of Steam Machine that tickles my enthusiast Funny Bone.
[3802.20 → 3812.44] This looks like pretty much a collaboration with Alienware to just have Alienware's Steam Machine be the official Steam Machine.
[3812.44 → 3815.86] And so it's going to be pretty low power.
[3816.08 → 3818.16] It's not going to be particularly upgradable.
[3820.70 → 3821.14] Yeah.
[3822.50 → 3825.28] So I don't know what to say.
[3825.86 → 3826.94] Steam Controller's coming out.
[3827.02 → 3828.08] Yeah, Steam Controller.
[3828.08 → 3828.38] So that might be cool.
[3828.62 → 3832.46] It'll have a custom graphics core that'll perform at about the level of an 860M.
[3832.46 → 3841.94] So if you want to play anything sort of more complicated than Super Meat Boy at 1080p, then you're not going to be that thrilled with the experience.
[3842.64 → 3853.96] There's a great video for the Steam Controller teaser showing it being used in games that looks really, really compelling.
[3854.18 → 3856.84] So everything from top-down RTS to shooters.
[3856.84 → 3862.52] And whoever's been using it probably has like a thousand hours logged on it.
[3862.72 → 3862.92] Yeah.
[3862.92 → 3864.24] So, yeah.
[3864.24 → 3867.00] They're looking pretty pro with the haptic feedback on that.
[3867.08 → 3868.72] They're looking pretty pro.
[3868.86 → 3874.18] But if you guys haven't seen the finished Steam Controller yet, then there's a picture of what it's going to look like right there.
[3874.30 → 3881.30] So we end up with something sort of that at least bears a resemblance to a normal game controller.
[3881.30 → 3885.00] Like your kind of got a D-pad, haptic touch D-pad sort of.
[3885.14 → 3889.46] They went, and they put that texture on there for the D-pad lovers.
[3889.46 → 3893.98] It's still just like the full circle is touch sensitive or whatever.
[3894.50 → 3895.52] It's all trackable.
[3895.56 → 3896.86] You've got an analog stick.
[3897.02 → 3898.24] You've got your ABBY.
[3898.34 → 3900.18] And then you've got your other touchpad.
[3900.30 → 3905.30] And then what's really cool, and they show how this is being used, is the reverse buttons.
[3905.40 → 3906.82] So you've got a squeeze in here.
[3906.90 → 3908.00] You've got the ones up here.
[3908.00 → 3912.04] And they show that being used in some really cool ways.
[3912.18 → 3914.84] Like we've seen after market stuff like this.
[3914.92 → 3920.08] Like we actually got some controllers in for review that had buttons remapped to the bottom.
[3920.30 → 3924.80] So that you didn't have to, so that you could aim and zoom and fire at the same time.
[3924.90 → 3926.40] Like scuff and stuff like that.
[3926.42 → 3927.10] Stuff like that.
[3927.44 → 3929.22] We thought the implementation was very poor.
[3929.34 → 3930.58] We didn't end up reviewing it.
[3930.94 → 3934.04] But Valves looks like it might be okay.
[3934.04 → 3935.04] Okay, so...
[3935.72 → 3941.74] I'm going to be like the Luke on this one and just say I could see this being a lot of fun for games like Civ.
[3942.10 → 3946.32] Just kind of sitting on the couch and playing Civ and laying back and kind of zoning out.
[3947.44 → 3951.18] I don't see a lot of use for it in, like you said, FPS games.
[3951.58 → 3953.26] Sure, it's better than a normal controller, maybe.
[3953.90 → 3958.46] But you're still just going to get beat by everyone with a mouse and keyboard as far as I can tell.
[3958.64 → 3960.80] I haven't played with things, so maybe I'm totally wrong.
[3960.80 → 3967.28] But, yeah, like Valve even says, it's not meant to replace a mouse and keyboard.
[3967.90 → 3970.72] It's meant to bring a better couch experience to PC gaming.
[3970.90 → 3972.60] So I think that they're doing a good job of that.
[3972.86 → 3974.76] Meanwhile, you've got Corsair.
[3976.36 → 3977.40] Hold on, couch.
[3977.40 → 3978.06] Oh, yeah.
[3978.58 → 3979.00] Lapdog.
[3979.30 → 3979.70] Lapdog.
[3979.82 → 3980.64] Thank you, there it is.
[3981.02 → 3985.18] Meanwhile, you've got guys like Nerdy Tech and even Corsair jumping in,
[3985.18 → 3992.00] trying to bring the mouse and keyboard experience to the couch rather than trying to get you to compromise with the controller.
[3992.16 → 3994.84] And I admire their efforts here.
[3994.94 → 4002.72] But for me, I would probably, I'm going to at least give Valve's controller a shot here.
[4002.72 → 4008.46] So this was posted by Bleedmen0xx on the forum here.
[4008.70 → 4010.38] I'm going to go ahead and copy it.
[4010.60 → 4020.46] And finally, finally, Valve is allowing refunds on Steam in a way that is actually meaningful
[4020.46 → 4026.74] and not just like, oh, you know, once in, you know, a blue moon if ever.
[4027.44 → 4034.26] So you can now request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam for any reason.
[4035.42 → 4035.98] Wow.
[4036.36 → 4037.46] That's actually kind of insane.
[4037.62 → 4039.46] Which shouldn't be insane.
[4040.02 → 4041.82] Finally, digital distribution.
[4041.94 → 4042.66] Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[4042.84 → 4043.36] So, okay.
[4043.82 → 4047.76] Back in the old days of physical media, you could return a game.
[4048.28 → 4049.54] This was pre-CD keys.
[4049.54 → 4054.04] This was back when the physical media represented the game.
[4054.30 → 4056.62] You didn't own the game anymore if you didn't have that disc.
[4056.72 → 4061.14] Now, CD keys came along and all of a sudden that disc meant nothing.
[4061.26 → 4063.98] Once you'd registered an account with Blizzard or whatever the case may be,
[4064.10 → 4066.74] I mean, you could be returning them nothing.
[4067.02 → 4067.14] Yeah.
[4067.50 → 4069.56] And you might as well be returned.
[4069.68 → 4070.90] Like, they weren't going to get a credit.
[4071.28 → 4076.30] So then digital came along and adopted that policy for some reason.
[4076.30 → 4080.52] Even though platforms like Steam are their own DRM.
[4080.80 → 4080.82] Yeah.
[4080.82 → 4083.06] They know if you've played the game.
[4083.34 → 4086.58] I mean, that was something that I could see a physical store being upset about.
[4086.66 → 4089.10] Well, you were just using us as a free rental.
[4089.46 → 4089.62] Yeah.
[4089.74 → 4091.20] You finished the game and brought it back.
[4091.32 → 4091.88] Screw you.
[4092.92 → 4093.84] Valve knows.
[4093.84 → 4097.18] They even know where you die on their maps in Counter-Strike.
[4097.68 → 4100.78] Like, they know how much you played the game.
[4100.78 → 4107.22] So now you will be issued a full refund of your purchase within a week of approval.
[4108.04 → 4111.82] If you have played the game for, I believe it's less than two hours.
[4112.00 → 4118.62] So 14 days, as long as you've played it, for less than two hours for pre-purchased titles.
[4119.26 → 4121.00] Refunds on in-game purchases.
[4121.00 → 4126.50] I think that's a huge one, especially with the prevalence of stuff like Counter-Strike items.
[4126.64 → 4132.72] Like, did you know there are some knives in Counter-Strike now that are like $1,500 for a knife skin?
[4133.88 → 4139.70] So within 48 hours of purchase, so long as it has not been consumed, modified, or transferred.
[4140.54 → 4142.02] Refunds on DLC.
[4143.04 → 4144.30] Ended blah blah blah.
[4144.44 → 4146.14] Refundable within 14 days of purchase.
[4146.14 → 4151.84] And if the underlying title has not been played for less than two hours since the DLC was purchased.
[4152.00 → 4152.58] Blah blah blah blah.
[4153.28 → 4155.70] Steam wallet refunds within 14 days of purchase.
[4155.78 → 4157.64] If they were purchased on Steam, you don't have to use any of those funds.
[4158.00 → 4159.30] And refunds on bundles.
[4159.38 → 4163.20] You can now receive a full refund for any bundle purchased on the Steam store.
[4163.20 → 4165.46] So long as none of the items in the bundle have been transferred.
[4165.92 → 4167.80] And if the combined usage of time is less than two hours.
[4167.86 → 4169.32] So two hours is the magic time.
[4169.60 → 4172.00] Which, honestly, is pretty generous.
[4172.36 → 4173.36] No refunds on movies.
[4173.36 → 4177.70] Because as long as you've used this movie for less than two hours.
[4179.06 → 4180.86] It's like, yeah, I missed the end credits.
[4181.28 → 4181.40] Thanks.
[4182.98 → 4188.24] So refunds are designed to remove the risk from purchasing titles on Steam.
[4188.72 → 4190.94] Not as a way to get free access to games.
[4191.08 → 4194.94] If it appears to us that you are abusing refunds, we may stop offering them to you.
[4195.30 → 4199.50] We do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale.
[4199.50 → 4202.44] And then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price.
[4202.44 → 4207.54] So this is effectively Valve offering price protection even.
[4208.04 → 4209.86] If you've played a game for less than two hours.
[4209.94 → 4210.72] That's cool, hey?
[4212.16 → 4212.84] Way to go.
[4213.00 → 4213.72] I think it's pretty sweet.
[4213.80 → 4214.62] Way to go, Valve.
[4214.68 → 4218.28] Some people in chat are calling me out about saying there was a $1,500 knife.
[4218.58 → 4221.44] There was one that was rumoured to go for $20,000.
[4221.82 → 4223.94] Like, no one has any real proof of that.
[4224.44 → 4226.40] And even if it was, that's like a one-off.
[4226.48 → 4227.62] That's not a market price.
[4227.62 → 4231.20] That's someone paying way too much for a stupid, like, $1,500 is way too much.
[4231.28 → 4232.78] Anyway, I'm on a tangent.
[4234.34 → 4236.94] Let's have a first Nick's Rants segment.
[4237.16 → 4237.74] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4237.84 → 4239.02] No, nobody wants to hear that.
[4239.82 → 4243.02] People in chat, this isn't, we talked about this earlier in the week.
[4243.12 → 4243.94] This isn't in the doc.
[4244.14 → 4248.94] But people in chat all streams have been asking about the thermal take thing.
[4249.38 → 4250.94] What's your opinion on that?
[4251.28 → 4252.14] What's my opinion?
[4252.44 → 4254.18] I don't give a rat's ass.
[4255.62 → 4256.84] That's why it wasn't in the doc.
[4257.24 → 4261.40] Yeah, it straight up wasn't in our document for topics to cover this week.
[4262.36 → 4264.56] If anyone, okay, you know what?
[4264.66 → 4267.26] Here, I'm going to put my computer.
[4267.26 → 4268.74] Now for the official Linus Rants segment.
[4268.74 → 4270.04] I'm going to put my computer down.
[4271.10 → 4272.36] I'm going to give you guys a little.
[4273.10 → 4274.60] I'm going to give you, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.
[4274.84 → 4277.60] I'm going to give you guys a little chat, okay?
[4277.60 → 4288.60] The PC industry is the most inbred, copying everyone, people stealing trade secrets from
[4288.60 → 4292.20] each other industry that could possibly exist.
[4292.64 → 4294.82] Remember, these are technology enthusiasts.
[4295.12 → 4299.02] These are the guys who are inventing 3D printers, okay?
[4299.46 → 4300.74] And 3D scanners.
[4301.48 → 4306.04] And like, better means of ripping each other off all day, okay?
[4306.04 → 4310.78] And so I'm going to go, and I'm going to drag someone else into this whole thing.
[4310.94 → 4314.80] I'm not even going to talk about Thermal take or Case Labs.
[4314.96 → 4315.64] I know where you're going.
[4315.86 → 4316.44] Yeah, I'm going there.
[4316.52 → 4317.16] Don't go there.
[4317.16 → 4317.76] I'm going there.
[4317.98 → 4321.08] So let's look at a company like Fractal Design.
[4321.42 → 4322.70] I love Fractal Design.
[4322.92 → 4323.96] I love Josh.
[4324.04 → 4324.86] I love Jens.
[4324.98 → 4325.98] I love Hannes.
[4326.46 → 4328.16] I'll even tolerate Johan.
[4328.28 → 4333.40] I'm naming all the people at Fractal Design who I know and like and respect.
[4333.40 → 4339.88] Fractal Design built their company, their first product, the Define R.
[4339.88 → 4347.64] They built their company off of taking the Aztec P180 and doing it better and cheaper than Aztec.
[4348.84 → 4357.36] And Aztec to this day, in my mind, although I haven't seen their new signature case, to this day has not found their groove again.
[4357.36 → 4360.10] And that's the brakes.
[4360.50 → 4366.94] Because the thing about a case, the thing about a physical object, is that if you can't find a way to patent it,
[4367.16 → 4371.68] and Josh from Fractal Design has actually been on the record saying,
[4371.96 → 4376.60] there's only so many ways to manufacture a rectangular box.
[4376.60 → 4383.96] He actually brought that up last week on what's, Paul and Kyle's show is Awesome Hardware, right?
[4384.46 → 4386.28] Awesome Sauce News and Paul's Hardware.
[4386.28 → 4388.32] I think their live show is called Awesome Hardware.
[4388.42 → 4389.54] Sorry, guys, if that's not correct.
[4389.54 → 4397.72] But Kyle had Josh on as a guest because Paul's in Taipei for Computer.
[4398.12 → 4401.74] So Josh actually said in that stream, he went to the old,
[4401.86 → 4408.22] there's only so many ways that you can make a metal box argument when it was brought up with him.
[4408.32 → 4411.48] So it's not like these guys aren't aware that that's what's happening.
[4411.48 → 4419.54] And the innovation in a case, the innovation in a case in my mind is not in the finished product.
[4419.82 → 4426.14] Because if I could make a case out of, you know, spider webs and pixie dust,
[4426.38 → 4428.50] then I could make the best case ever.
[4428.70 → 4429.40] Of course I could.
[4429.84 → 4433.44] The innovation in a case is in manufacturing.
[4433.44 → 4442.26] So if you patent a process for bending aluminum in a way that literally no one else can even make your case,
[4442.62 → 4444.30] then you innovate it.
[4444.62 → 4453.30] If you innovate the idea of having, like, okay, NZXT's innovation of removing the 5.25 inch bays from the H440.
[4454.16 → 4456.82] Innovative idea, but you can't patent that,
[4457.04 → 4460.68] and you can't prevent your competitors from making a case with no 5.25 inch bays.
[4460.68 → 4463.02] And NZXT is not a bunch of idiots,
[4463.22 → 4465.20] and they know that someone is going to,
[4465.34 → 4467.06] as soon as that case is successful,
[4467.54 → 4469.96] everyone else and their dog is going to be doing it.
[4470.02 → 4472.70] Because that's not, that's just,
[4472.84 → 4473.40] that's just,
[4474.20 → 4475.40] it's an idea.
[4475.88 → 4477.24] You can't patent an idea,
[4477.56 → 4478.94] like, well, you can patent an idea,
[4479.08 → 4481.96] but you can't patent, like,
[4482.40 → 4483.44] removing a spec,
[4483.68 → 4485.06] I guess is what I'm trying to say.
[4485.12 → 4486.76] You can't patent a spec difference.
[4486.76 → 4491.78] So, like, you can't patent the idea of executing a case that doesn't have a certain aspect.
[4492.22 → 4492.46] Yeah.
[4492.76 → 4494.90] Like, it's not that you can't patent an idea,
[4495.06 → 4496.18] it's that you can't,
[4496.18 → 4499.02] you can't patent an aspect of something that's so ubiquitous.
[4499.24 → 4500.86] Okay, 5.25 inch bays exist.
[4501.00 → 4501.08] Yeah.
[4501.44 → 4502.88] And you'll have cases on the
[4502.96 → 4505.90] with a spec sheet on the side that says 1 times 5.25,
[4506.26 → 4507.86] or 5 times 5.25.
[4508.00 → 4508.10] Yeah.
[4508.10 → 4512.32] The fact that you just made a case that says 0 times 5.25 is not,
[4512.50 → 4513.36] is not,
[4513.64 → 4514.48] It's not patentable.
[4514.48 → 4515.04] Yeah, that's not,
[4515.12 → 4516.26] that's not patentable.
[4516.46 → 4516.60] Yeah.
[4516.76 → 4517.22] Um,
[4517.44 → 4519.86] whereas the idea of,
[4519.96 → 4520.18] you know,
[4520.26 → 4522.58] okay, looking at Irwin's transforming case,
[4522.76 → 4525.72] where they literally made something that no one else can make,
[4526.42 → 4527.78] that is innovation.
[4528.28 → 4529.10] So, to me,
[4529.44 → 4532.56] someone like Case Labs came along, and they did something really important.
[4532.98 → 4534.34] They made easy,
[4534.62 → 4535.10] spacious,
[4535.42 → 4536.84] water-cooling-friendly cases,
[4536.84 → 4541.00] accessible and affordable and high quality in a way that,
[4541.34 → 4541.52] hey,
[4541.68 → 4545.28] if we're going to start talking about copying people in a way that I,
[4545.40 → 4547.44] who I would consider to be their spiritual predecessor,
[4547.78 → 4550.18] Mountain Mods didn't manage to do.
[4550.62 → 4552.70] That's what Case Labs did.
[4553.18 → 4555.02] And they did a great job.
[4555.56 → 4558.76] But if they're going to kind of run and cry foul because someone,
[4559.02 → 4559.94] you know,
[4560.04 → 4562.66] copied that idea of making an affordable,
[4563.08 → 4563.56] roomy,
[4564.00 → 4565.12] well-thought-out case,
[4565.54 → 4566.02] I mean,
[4566.02 → 4566.42] uh,
[4566.62 → 4568.36] I don't know.
[4568.64 → 4568.98] Um,
[4569.02 → 4569.52] to me,
[4569.64 → 4571.46] it's about actually making it.
[4572.10 → 4572.42] Um,
[4572.42 → 4576.70] and it's not necessarily about the idea of having a lot of places for a
[4576.70 → 4580.22] radiator if you don't actually execute it or someone else executes it
[4580.22 → 4580.40] better.
[4580.48 → 4583.00] And that is another thing to consider here.
[4583.36 → 4583.84] Cases,
[4584.36 → 4584.54] how,
[4584.54 → 4585.02] wow,
[4585.02 → 4586.90] there's more to a case than the spec and the look.
[4587.56 → 4591.72] And if Case Labs believes that their quality is great.
[4592.42 → 4594.28] And from my experience with them,
[4594.42 → 4595.02] it is,
[4595.16 → 4598.92] then they shouldn't be worried about competition from Thermal take period.
[4598.92 → 4601.98] so there that's my take on it
[4601.98 → 4603.50] I have talked about it
[4603.50 → 4605.46] and you know what
[4605.46 → 4608.06] I've got people saying I think the issue is that
[4608.06 → 4610.16] the people they're buying their cases from is the same
[4610.16 → 4612.20] manufacturer well yeah
[4612.20 → 4614.20] that's the PC industry man
[4614.20 → 4615.56] you think that
[4615.56 → 4617.54] every power
[4617.54 → 4620.22] when Corsair
[4620.22 → 4622.08] releases their 80 plus platinum
[4622.08 → 4624.16] power supply, and you know
[4624.16 → 4626.34] everyone else has an 80 plus platinum
[4626.34 → 4627.90] power supply the next week
[4627.90 → 4630.02] you think that's not the same thing
[4630.02 → 4630.92] come on
[4630.92 → 4632.46] come on
[4632.46 → 4634.98] come on
[4634.98 → 4637.98] you think that when NZXT releases the
[4637.98 → 4640.38] Kraken X40 and Corsair
[4640.38 → 4641.86] has a single
[4641.86 → 4644.22] 140mm all in one liquid
[4644.22 → 4645.98] cooler that's also an Acetic
[4645.98 → 4647.84] design you know a little while later
[4647.84 → 4650.04] you think someone didn't make a deal
[4650.04 → 4651.98] a volume agreement or
[4651.98 → 4653.68] a payout for a
[4653.68 → 4656.08] limited time exclusive and
[4656.08 → 4657.74] then all of a sudden the design is open to everyone
[4657.74 → 4659.34] that's how the PC industry works
[4659.34 → 4661.88] rebadges rebrands
[4661.88 → 4663.66] there are only a few companies actually
[4663.66 → 4664.56] building things
[4664.56 → 4667.70] and they're going to be the ones that are
[4667.70 → 4668.74] going to hold all the
[4668.74 → 4670.14] they're going to hold all the cards
[4670.14 → 4672.52] and they're going to have the power in the long term
[4672.52 → 4673.66] there you go
[4673.66 → 4674.76] so apparently
[4674.76 → 4676.56] Josh wasn't on Awesome Hardware
[4676.56 → 4678.14] I don't know where I saw it then
[4678.14 → 4679.24] I've seen him talk about it
[4679.24 → 4680.44] yeah he was talking to somebody
[4680.44 → 4681.58] on one of the shows
[4681.58 → 4682.32] I can't remember
[4682.32 → 4685.04] I watch a lot of videos
[4685.04 → 4685.66] every week
[4685.66 → 4686.46] I've got people saying
[4686.46 → 4687.46] they don't think I get it
[4687.46 → 4688.52] like I've looked at pictures
[4688.52 → 4689.06] of the cases
[4689.06 → 4690.78] I see the similarity
[4690.78 → 4691.96] sure I do
[4691.96 → 4693.06] and like
[4693.06 → 4694.24] that's dumb
[4694.24 → 4695.60] but like
[4695.60 → 4696.64] it's not like
[4696.64 → 4697.70] it's not like Apple
[4697.70 → 4698.72] doesn't get all upset
[4698.72 → 4699.70] when someone makes a phone
[4699.70 → 4700.62] that's similar to the iPhone
[4700.62 → 4701.60] and even they've given up
[4701.60 → 4702.58] at this point it looks like
[4702.58 → 4703.52] so
[4703.52 → 4704.80] somebody was saying
[4704.80 → 4706.06] Apple could probably patent
[4706.06 → 4707.42] the zero five and a half
[4707.42 → 4708.36] or five and a quarter inch
[4708.36 → 4709.44] bay idea that you had
[4709.44 → 4710.24] yeah possibly
[4710.24 → 4710.84] probably
[4710.84 → 4712.10] you're probably right
[4712.10 → 4712.82] they could patent it
[4712.82 → 4714.16] I'm not sure if it would be upheld though
[4714.16 → 4715.04] no, but they would
[4715.04 → 4716.12] they would probably patent it
[4716.12 → 4717.10] probably
[4717.10 → 4717.68] anyway
[4717.68 → 4718.46] apparently it was in
[4718.46 → 4719.34] Jay's Two Cents Tech Talk
[4719.34 → 4720.10] oh sorry
[4720.10 → 4721.04] Jay's Two Cents
[4721.04 → 4721.84] my bad
[4721.84 → 4723.78] okay so
[4723.78 → 4726.18] Google advertises
[4726.18 → 4727.30] a Nexus 6
[4727.30 → 4728.46] running Windows Phone
[4728.46 → 4729.86] Microsoft advertises
[4729.86 → 4730.96] a Lucia 535
[4730.96 → 4732.52] running Android
[4732.52 → 4733.68] so the original poster here
[4733.68 → 4734.66] was rude
[4734.66 → 4737.34] copy link URL
[4737.34 → 4738.72] I actually
[4738.72 → 4739.42] you know what's funny
[4739.42 → 4739.84] is I
[4739.84 → 4741.96] I had some notes
[4741.96 → 4742.50] in my
[4742.50 → 4743.22] in my email
[4743.22 → 4743.86] because I've always
[4743.86 → 4745.34] I always forget to open up the dock
[4745.34 → 4746.74] and like post the things
[4746.74 → 4748.32] and I just assumed
[4748.32 → 4748.74] Valve
[4748.74 → 4749.80] Steam refunds
[4749.80 → 4750.50] would be in the dock
[4750.50 → 4751.26] and I kind of went
[4751.26 → 4752.10] oh yeah
[4752.10 → 4753.32] all the Computer stuff
[4753.32 → 4754.06] there was like
[4754.06 → 4755.18] straight up no room
[4755.18 → 4755.78] I had like
[4755.78 → 4757.60] 35 topics in the dock
[4757.60 → 4758.06] and I was like
[4758.06 → 4759.18] well I have to cut like
[4759.18 → 4760.50] half of these
[4760.50 → 4761.18] not actually
[4761.18 → 4761.70] but like
[4761.70 → 4763.52] a significant amount of these
[4763.52 → 4764.96] and that was like
[4764.96 → 4766.30] with me not even just like
[4766.30 → 4767.48] putting stuff in periodically
[4767.48 → 4768.72] and that was without
[4768.72 → 4770.40] the three-minute conversation
[4770.40 → 4771.16] we just had about
[4771.16 → 4771.80] the thing
[4771.80 → 4773.00] so this is cool hey
[4773.00 → 4775.16] I would love to see a future
[4775.16 → 4776.38] where you get to choose
[4776.38 → 4777.12] your phone hardware
[4777.12 → 4778.28] and your OS independently
[4778.28 → 4779.64] um
[4779.64 → 4781.46] yeah
[4781.46 → 4783.30] apparently some marketing agencies
[4783.30 → 4785.10] thought that the future was now
[4785.10 → 4785.78] yeah
[4785.78 → 4788.54] so you know
[4788.54 → 4789.64] is this real
[4789.64 → 4790.96] it doesn't necessarily
[4790.96 → 4792.04] look like
[4792.04 → 4792.82] anything like this
[4792.82 → 4794.00] is coming anytime soon
[4794.00 → 4794.54] but
[4794.54 → 4796.06] it's also very
[4796.06 → 4797.12] Illuminati confirmed
[4797.12 → 4798.52] that both of these mistakes
[4798.52 → 4799.92] showed up at around the same time
[4799.92 → 4800.32] so
[4800.32 → 4801.50] you know
[4801.50 → 4803.12] I think it'd be super cool
[4803.12 → 4804.78] I think it also opens up
[4804.78 → 4805.44] a can of worms
[4805.44 → 4806.26] in terms of
[4806.26 → 4806.48] you know
[4806.48 → 4806.92] compatibility
[4806.92 → 4807.90] and drivers
[4807.90 → 4809.08] and blah blah blah
[4809.08 → 4809.66] blah blah blah
[4809.66 → 4811.06] that we've been free from
[4811.06 → 4811.74] from on phones
[4811.74 → 4812.48] up until now
[4812.48 → 4813.86] but uh
[4813.86 → 4814.38] still
[4814.38 → 4815.50] still very cool stuff
[4815.50 → 4816.18] um
[4816.18 → 4816.94] well I don't think
[4816.94 → 4818.28] I've only really got one more
[4818.28 → 4819.14] that I really want to hit
[4819.14 → 4820.20] the original poster here
[4820.20 → 4821.20] was Joss
[4821.20 → 4822.68] and I think we're going to need
[4822.68 → 4824.40] a straw poll for you guys here
[4824.40 → 4826.04] because uh
[4826.04 → 4826.58] I
[4826.58 → 4827.82] I literally found this
[4827.82 → 4828.90] like five minutes
[4828.90 → 4830.20] before the show started
[4830.20 → 4831.92] and I was laughing my head off
[4831.92 → 4832.38] and I was like
[4832.38 → 4833.28] what are you laughing at
[4833.28 → 4834.48] and I just pointed at my screen
[4834.48 → 4834.70] he's like
[4834.70 → 4836.26] okay I think we have to talk about that
[4836.26 → 4837.22] yeah so
[4837.22 → 4837.84] um
[4837.84 → 4840.72] laughing
[4840.72 → 4842.56] I
[4842.56 → 4843.16] I know
[4843.16 → 4844.18] I'm leaving you guys
[4844.18 → 4845.14] in suspense here
[4845.14 → 4846.02] but this is
[4846.02 → 4846.98] this is worth it
[4846.98 → 4847.82] Illuminati
[4847.82 → 4850.00] the chat's all Illuminati
[4850.00 → 4853.06] okay so
[4853.06 → 4854.78] no it needs to be turned up
[4854.78 → 4855.14] uh
[4855.14 → 4855.68] no I just
[4855.68 → 4856.30] I just do whatever
[4856.30 → 4857.66] I only did that twice in a row
[4857.66 → 4858.50] like by accident
[4858.50 → 4859.30] yeah but
[4859.30 → 4859.78] okay
[4859.78 → 4860.24] oh
[4860.24 → 4862.18] I think I know what you're talking about
[4862.18 → 4863.28] okay well
[4863.28 → 4864.02] at any rate
[4864.02 → 4865.10] here we go guys
[4865.10 → 4868.40] oh
[4868.40 → 4870.86] the original poster here
[4870.86 → 4872.76] I'm going to post the straw poll now
[4872.76 → 4874.56] the original
[4874.56 → 4876.34] the original poster here
[4876.34 → 4877.36] is uh
[4877.36 → 4878.02] Joss
[4878.02 → 4879.72] and the original article here
[4879.72 → 4880.64] is from Phone Arena
[4880.64 → 4882.36] here it is
[4882.36 → 4883.88] it is
[4883.88 → 4885.44] a smart wearable
[4885.44 → 4887.12] called the sex machine
[4887.12 → 4889.26] that keeps track
[4889.26 → 4890.56] of sex performance
[4890.56 → 4891.36] metrics
[4891.36 → 4892.56] and
[4892.56 → 4893.74] you wouldn't believe
[4893.74 → 4894.56] where it's worn
[4894.56 → 4895.78] unless you saw this
[4895.78 → 4896.20] jiff
[4896.20 → 4897.28] then you'll probably
[4897.28 → 4898.00] figure out
[4898.00 → 4899.16] exactly
[4899.16 → 4900.90] where it's going to be
[4900.90 → 4901.20] worn
[4901.20 → 4901.52] now
[4901.52 → 4903.56] I can see a lot of
[4903.56 → 4904.10] you know
[4904.10 → 4905.02] potential
[4905.02 → 4906.20] you know
[4906.20 → 4907.22] good that could come
[4907.22 → 4907.74] of this
[4907.74 → 4908.22] you know
[4908.22 → 4908.82] um
[4908.82 → 4909.16] yeah
[4909.16 → 4909.56] you know
[4909.56 → 4910.80] what's good for him
[4910.80 → 4911.54] is good for her
[4911.54 → 4912.30] and so on
[4912.30 → 4913.06] and so forth
[4913.06 → 4913.28] and
[4913.28 → 4914.48] and you know
[4914.48 → 4916.34] there are tons of
[4916.34 → 4917.16] statistical evidence
[4917.16 → 4917.62] out there
[4917.62 → 4918.08] that a
[4918.08 → 4918.38] you know
[4918.38 → 4919.52] a healthy sex life
[4919.52 → 4920.70] and maybe one that we can
[4920.70 → 4920.96] you know
[4920.96 → 4921.90] if we can make it healthier
[4921.90 → 4923.52] is good for a relationship
[4923.52 → 4924.76] and all that kind of stuff
[4924.76 → 4925.70] but
[4925.70 → 4927.24] I've also got a lot of people
[4927.24 → 4928.74] suggesting ways this could be used
[4928.74 → 4929.28] for evil
[4929.28 → 4930.28] like um
[4930.28 → 4931.50] Taryn's using a great
[4931.50 → 4932.32] biking app
[4932.32 → 4933.90] that actually measures
[4933.90 → 4934.84] like it shows
[4934.84 → 4935.46] um
[4935.46 → 4935.94] you know
[4935.94 → 4936.74] how you performed
[4936.74 → 4937.58] on a particular
[4937.58 → 4938.42] like a split
[4938.42 → 4938.94] yeah yeah
[4938.94 → 4939.80] like split times
[4939.80 → 4940.42] um
[4940.42 → 4940.90] as you
[4940.90 → 4941.84] as you bike around
[4941.84 → 4942.78] compared to other people
[4942.78 → 4943.48] that have been through
[4943.48 → 4944.06] that particular
[4944.06 → 4946.16] through that particular
[4946.16 → 4946.62] route
[4946.62 → 4948.10] um
[4948.10 → 4948.78] you know
[4948.78 → 4950.50] ways you could
[4950.50 → 4951.46] integrate this
[4951.46 → 4952.10] into a social
[4952.10 → 4953.38] through that particular
[4953.38 → 4953.92] route
[4953.92 → 4954.50] social
[4954.50 → 4956.22] social network
[4956.22 → 4957.24] features here
[4957.24 → 4957.72] um
[4957.72 → 4958.18] you know
[4958.18 → 4958.82] you could see
[4958.82 → 4959.88] if you're the best
[4959.88 → 4960.68] performing guy
[4960.68 → 4961.66] on your street
[4961.66 → 4962.68] you know
[4962.68 → 4963.66] stuff like that
[4963.66 → 4964.22] um
[4964.22 → 4965.90] oh no
[4965.90 → 4966.78] so I'm gonna fire up
[4966.78 → 4968.04] the straw pool results
[4968.04 → 4968.36] here
[4968.36 → 4969.80] do you want
[4969.80 → 4971.78] your sex performance
[4971.78 → 4972.64] monitored
[4972.64 → 4975.02] we've got
[4975.02 → 4975.38] a
[4975.38 → 4976.24] no and eagle
[4976.24 → 4976.64] definite
[4976.64 → 4978.40] minority here
[4978.40 → 4979.88] saying yes
[4979.88 → 4981.84] 24% of them
[4981.84 → 4982.64] are okay
[4982.64 → 4983.50] with having their
[4983.50 → 4984.38] sex performance
[4984.38 → 4984.98] monitored
[4984.98 → 4986.84] and I don't even know
[4986.84 → 4987.76] if this is all
[4987.76 → 4988.82] going into the cloud
[4988.82 → 4989.88] or whatever
[4989.88 → 4991.06] I haven't actually
[4991.06 → 4991.88] we found this right
[4991.88 → 4992.34] before the show
[4992.34 → 4993.08] it's probably
[4993.08 → 4993.96] it probably is going
[4993.96 → 4994.28] into the cloud
[4994.28 → 4995.16] oh man
[4995.16 → 4996.46] I doubt it's stored
[4996.46 → 4996.88] locally
[4996.88 → 4998.20] I highly doubt
[4998.20 → 4998.52] it's stored
[4998.52 → 4999.14] can you imagine
[4999.14 → 4999.44] that
[4999.44 → 4999.76] okay
[4999.76 → 5000.52] loading up
[5000.52 → 5000.98] an android
[5000.98 → 5001.32] app
[5001.32 → 5001.74] uh
[5001.74 → 5002.22] this app
[5002.22 → 5002.52] requests
[5002.52 → 5002.94] permission
[5002.94 → 5003.62] to access
[5003.62 → 5004.16] your camera
[5004.16 → 5004.86] your contacts
[5004.86 → 5005.68] your sex performance
[5005.68 → 5007.90] can you even
[5007.90 → 5008.22] imagine
[5008.22 → 5010.80] oh no
[5010.80 → 5012.86] yeah we've got
[5012.86 → 5013.48] more noes
[5013.48 → 5013.96] coming in
[5013.96 → 5014.48] now that we're
[5014.48 → 5015.06] sort of talking
[5015.06 → 5016.14] about cloud storage
[5016.14 → 5017.06] it would be
[5017.06 → 5018.08] interesting to see
[5018.08 → 5018.68] how
[5018.68 → 5019.92] um
[5019.92 → 5020.74] say
[5020.74 → 5021.70] say
[5021.70 → 5022.76] someone's
[5022.76 → 5023.12] wife
[5023.12 → 5024.02] has access
[5024.02 → 5024.92] to this
[5024.92 → 5025.26] app
[5025.26 → 5026.34] and she's
[5026.34 → 5026.74] unhappy
[5026.74 → 5026.98] in the
[5026.98 → 5027.44] relationship
[5027.44 → 5027.80] and she
[5027.80 → 5028.12] wants to
[5028.12 → 5028.46] file for
[5028.46 → 5028.98] divorce
[5028.98 → 5029.94] could she
[5029.94 → 5030.40] use that
[5030.40 → 5030.90] as evidence
[5030.90 → 5031.50] I don't
[5031.50 → 5032.06] know
[5032.06 → 5032.92] or like
[5032.92 → 5033.30] can you
[5033.30 → 5033.80] imagine
[5033.80 → 5034.36] like
[5034.36 → 5035.12] you know
[5035.12 → 5035.60] all the
[5035.60 → 5036.08] wives and
[5036.08 → 5036.44] girlfriends
[5036.44 → 5037.26] getting together
[5037.26 → 5038.10] and comparing
[5038.10 → 5039.74] comparing notes
[5039.74 → 5040.36] you know they
[5040.36 → 5040.82] would
[5040.82 → 5041.48] I know
[5041.48 → 5042.12] they totally
[5042.12 → 5042.42] would
[5042.42 → 5043.12] I know
[5043.12 → 5044.30] oh man
[5044.30 → 5044.82] that is like
[5044.82 → 5045.60] some not cool
[5045.60 → 5046.52] stuff right there
[5046.52 → 5047.24] well
[5047.24 → 5048.00] I guess it
[5048.00 → 5048.32] depends
[5048.32 → 5049.20] yeah it
[5049.20 → 5049.48] depends
[5049.48 → 5050.32] well for me
[5050.32 → 5050.88] that would be
[5050.88 → 5051.84] some not cool
[5051.84 → 5052.84] stuff right there
[5052.84 → 5054.46] straight up
[5054.46 → 5055.36] um
[5055.36 → 5056.30] I've actually
[5056.30 → 5057.64] got one more
[5057.64 → 5058.74] one more topic
[5058.74 → 5059.82] that's sort of
[5059.82 → 5060.82] just a line
[5060.82 → 5061.50] it's like it's
[5061.50 → 5062.14] a Linus media
[5062.14 → 5062.78] group topic
[5062.78 → 5063.78] it's not actual
[5063.78 → 5064.22] news
[5064.22 → 5065.56] but we're working
[5065.56 → 5066.14] on something that
[5066.14 → 5066.86] I think is pretty
[5066.86 → 5067.18] cool
[5067.18 → 5068.54] I've finally
[5068.54 → 5069.94] I get to talk
[5069.94 → 5070.40] to YouTube

[5071.14 → 5071.54] of neat
[5071.54 → 5072.02] yeah
[5072.02 → 5073.18] for years
[5073.18 → 5074.16] I didn't actually
[5074.16 → 5074.74] have much
[5074.74 → 5075.52] interaction with
[5075.52 → 5075.94] my Google
[5075.94 → 5076.64] overlords

[5083.02 → 5083.88] and we are
[5083.88 → 5084.38] working on
[5084.38 → 5084.70] something
[5084.70 → 5085.86] like it's no
[5085.86 → 5086.68] secret that

[5090.64 → 5091.04] some very
[5091.04 → 5091.50] similar
[5091.50 → 5092.34] functionality
[5092.34 → 5093.04] to
[5093.04 → 5093.84] annotations
[5093.84 → 5094.26] which don't
[5094.26 → 5094.62] work on
[5094.62 → 5094.96] mobile
[5094.96 → 5095.88] and now
[5095.88 → 5096.54] cards

[5104.22 → 5104.72] things like

[5110.24 → 5110.88] which by the way
[5110.88 → 5111.40] we should post

[5111.74 → 5112.58] we have cool
[5112.58 → 5113.24] Linus tech tips

[5116.00 → 5116.52] first on
[5116.52 → 5117.08] oh I can't
[5117.08 → 5117.54] read my back

[5118.40 → 5118.76] want one that
[5118.76 → 5119.20] says first

[5125.74 → 5126.90] Linus tech tips
[5126.90 → 5127.40] can do that
[5127.40 → 5128.28] um so we're
[5128.28 → 5128.92] working on a
[5128.92 → 5129.54] way to
[5129.54 → 5131.28] since cards
[5131.28 → 5131.68] are not
[5131.68 → 5132.64] clickable directly
[5132.64 → 5133.78] and instead
[5133.78 → 5134.40] you have to
[5134.40 → 5135.12] go to
[5135.12 → 5136.04] like this
[5136.04 → 5137.10] little eye
[5137.10 → 5137.78] in the corner
[5137.78 → 5138.30] in order to
[5138.30 → 5138.76] find them
[5138.76 → 5139.44] we're trying to
[5139.44 → 5139.98] work on some
[5139.98 → 5140.94] ways to make
[5140.94 → 5141.56] that friendly
[5141.56 → 5142.58] to both mobile
[5142.58 → 5143.86] and desktop
[5143.86 → 5144.80] users and
[5144.80 → 5145.60] so there's a
[5145.60 → 5146.34] video here that
[5146.34 → 5146.90] I'll link
[5146.90 → 5148.18] um that I'll
[5148.18 → 5148.58] link in the
[5148.58 → 5149.16] twitch chat
[5149.16 → 5151.60] but this is
[5151.60 → 5152.44] the video where
[5152.44 → 5152.96] we're kind of
[5152.96 → 5153.60] showing some of
[5153.60 → 5154.36] the ideas we
[5154.36 → 5156.16] have for ways
[5156.16 → 5156.88] that we can
[5156.88 → 5158.24] get people to
[5158.24 → 5159.48] know that
[5159.48 → 5160.00] that's where to
[5160.00 → 5160.62] go look like
[5160.62 → 5161.38] subscribe is
[5161.38 → 5161.90] handled through
[5161.90 → 5162.44] that little
[5162.44 → 5163.42] watermark in
[5163.42 → 5164.12] the bottom now
[5164.12 → 5165.62] and then we're
[5165.62 → 5166.40] trying to like
[5166.40 → 5167.90] this is a rough
[5167.90 → 5168.68] draft right now
[5168.68 → 5169.32] but we're trying
[5169.32 → 5170.46] to come up with
[5170.46 → 5171.42] a way that's not
[5171.42 → 5173.02] totally obnoxious
[5173.02 → 5174.28] looking but that
[5174.28 → 5175.42] will get people to
[5175.42 → 5177.40] be able to find
[5177.40 → 5177.94] the things that
[5177.94 → 5178.64] we're talking about
[5178.64 → 5180.90] so I don't know
[5180.90 → 5181.54] I don't know
[5181.54 → 5182.32] that's that's sort
[5182.32 → 5182.80] of some of our
[5182.80 → 5183.54] ideas right now
[5183.54 → 5184.28] but we'd love to
[5184.28 → 5184.98] hear your guy's
[5184.98 → 5186.22] thoughts I think
[5186.22 → 5186.76] it's pretty cool
[5186.76 → 5187.34] stuff like that
[5187.34 → 5188.42] i I like it i
[5188.42 → 5190.78] think that it
[5190.78 → 5191.58] hopefully it's a
[5191.58 → 5192.54] good balance but
[5192.54 → 5195.82] um yeah so i
[5195.82 → 5196.26] guess that's pretty
[5196.26 → 5196.72] much it
[5196.72 → 5200.48] um some people in
[5200.48 → 5200.98] chat were asking
[5200.98 → 5202.42] about Ltd fans
[5202.42 → 5203.14] what are they
[5203.14 → 5203.74] any update
[5203.74 → 5205.80] um I there is
[5205.80 → 5207.02] no update but
[5207.02 → 5207.72] there will be one
[5207.72 → 5209.12] so that's the
[5209.12 → 5210.58] update stay tuned
[5210.58 → 5211.66] stay tuned for the
[5211.66 → 5212.04] rest of the
[5212.04 → 5212.80] computer coverage
[5212.80 → 5213.68] stay subscribed
[5213.68 → 5215.04] that's a good
[5215.04 → 5215.84] teaser watch the
[5215.84 → 5216.16] rest of the
[5216.16 → 5216.92] computer coverage
[5216.92 → 5217.36] stay subscribed
[5217.36 → 5218.86] don't miss any of
[5218.86 → 5219.46] the computer
[5219.46 → 5219.94] coverage and like
[5219.94 → 5220.66] our videos
[5220.66 → 5222.74] uh no after party
[5222.74 → 5224.08] today because it's
[5224.08 → 5224.80] hot and I'm tired
[5224.80 → 5226.60] and I'm sweating if
[5226.60 → 5227.20] you couldn't tell
[5227.20 → 5227.94] yeah it's disgusting
[5227.94 → 5228.42] and I'm more
[5228.42 → 5229.24] dressed than you
[5229.24 → 5229.84] you're wearing a
[5229.84 → 5230.42] sleeveless shirt
[5230.42 → 5233.54] I'm also like far
[5233.54 → 5234.74] more overweight than
[5234.74 → 5235.20] you are
[5235.20 → 5237.00] so there's that
[5237.00 → 5237.98] I didn't say it
[5237.98 → 5239.58] i can
[5239.58 → 5240.46] neither confirm
[5240.46 → 5241.00] nor deny
[5241.00 → 5241.58] there you go
[5241.58 → 5243.04] um oh we should
[5243.04 → 5244.10] probably do we
[5244.10 → 5245.08] should probably do a
[5245.08 → 5246.34] quick update on
[5246.34 → 5247.64] wait do they know
[5247.64 → 5248.52] about the stakes
[5248.52 → 5250.46] no
[5250.46 → 5252.94] okay, so Nick is
[5252.94 → 5253.86] losing the bet
[5253.86 → 5254.84] yeah right now
[5254.84 → 5256.30] it looks like it
[5256.30 → 5257.12] looks like it's not
