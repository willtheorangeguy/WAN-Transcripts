[0.00 --> 5.28]  I think we're live. Yes, I think we're live. All right, guys, welcome to the WAN show.
[5.64 --> 9.06]  I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to turn my... What are you doing?
[9.16 --> 9.70]  What are you doing?
[10.10 --> 12.90]  I have my voice in my ear.
[12.90 --> 13.60]  How's your day going?
[13.74 --> 15.04]  So I'm being confused.
[15.16 --> 15.26]  Good.
[16.22 --> 21.82]  Yes. So some of you may have noticed that last week when I had Harry Potter as my co-host,
[22.14 --> 27.08]  the show managed to actually stay on topic. And some of you wish for that trend to continue.
[27.08 --> 32.68]  So I'm going to do my utmost to not let him completely derail this show.
[33.20 --> 35.96]  Yeah, we're just going to bring Harry Potter back permanently.
[36.40 --> 39.26]  So we got a bunch of great topics for you guys.
[39.64 --> 46.32]  HTC's value has plummeted so much in the last four years that they are now effectively valueless.
[46.84 --> 48.30]  More on that at 11.
[49.12 --> 53.18]  Alphabet, a company called Alphabet now owns Google.
[53.18 --> 59.24]  Not just owns like pwned their base, but like owns like they belong to them.
[59.80 --> 62.96]  Also, some poor farmer was quoted...
[62.96 --> 64.84]  Yes, I see Harry. Thank you.
[65.92 --> 68.76]  You can touch me with your Harry something else, but not that one.
[69.54 --> 74.68]  Some farmer was quoted hundreds of thousands of dollars for an internet connection.
[74.68 --> 78.00]  And Spotify... Oh, we've got a lot of great topics today, actually.
[78.20 --> 82.12]  Spotify rumored to be ending their free music streaming.
[82.62 --> 84.24]  And do you want to do the last one?
[84.26 --> 84.68]  I'll do one of them.
[84.78 --> 90.44]  Certain Swedish high schools are adding three hours of esports classes a week.
[93.94 --> 95.40]  Peter Game High School is real.
[96.78 --> 97.72]  Is this going to go?
[97.72 --> 99.24]  I think it worked.
[115.24 --> 122.40]  Oh, crap. Sorry, that thing.
[123.40 --> 124.32]  Sponsors today!
[125.66 --> 126.14]  Squarespace!
[126.14 --> 126.58]  Yeah!
[127.60 --> 127.84]  Yeah!
[128.44 --> 129.34]  Best space.
[129.68 --> 131.20]  Did you just say desk space?
[131.40 --> 132.24]  Best space.
[132.38 --> 133.18]  Best space.
[133.34 --> 134.76]  Yeah, best space.
[134.90 --> 137.66]  Also, ooh, that's a new one.
[138.16 --> 139.00]  Tunnel Bear!
[139.44 --> 142.86]  Start browsing privately today at tunnelbear.com slash LTT.
[143.60 --> 145.02]  Okay, now I'm going to do a thing.
[145.26 --> 147.00]  I'm going to put that back...
[147.00 --> 147.64]  Okay.
[147.82 --> 149.46]  ...before we navigate away from it,
[149.46 --> 152.88]  and then the intro will start playing
[152.88 --> 155.72]  instead of having the ad spot on top of it
[155.72 --> 157.70]  when I switch the scene.
[157.94 --> 159.68]  How much do you want to bet it's just going to break?
[160.14 --> 161.08]  No, no, it shouldn't break.
[161.20 --> 163.78]  I have the intro stored locally on my machine now.
[164.26 --> 165.04]  Yeah, see?
[165.32 --> 167.38]  Also, this is the latest XSplit.
[167.38 --> 169.68]  So we were still running a version of XSplit
[169.68 --> 171.88]  that must have been, like, a year old
[171.88 --> 174.30]  on the stream computer in the old office.
[174.54 --> 176.00]  Just because, like...
[176.00 --> 178.18]  And it was, like, kind of, like, broken.
[178.66 --> 183.04]  Like, that Windows install itself is just broken.
[183.30 --> 183.62]  Oh, yeah.
[183.62 --> 185.72]  So that machine would just shut off,
[185.76 --> 188.58]  and, like, we had our regularly occurring blue screens
[188.58 --> 191.56]  thanks to our Blackmagic capture cards,
[191.74 --> 193.74]  and, like, all this stuff was broken about it.
[193.80 --> 195.26]  So we actually...
[195.26 --> 198.18]  What we needed to do was uninstall and reinstall
[198.18 --> 199.66]  in order to get the upgrade to work,
[200.12 --> 202.24]  and we just never did it.
[202.86 --> 206.40]  So, yeah, we're actually running a proper version of XSplit now.
[206.42 --> 207.62]  We did that for a long time, too.
[208.02 --> 208.46]  Yes.
[208.46 --> 209.32]  Which was kind of sad.
[209.46 --> 211.82]  Which is kind of the world's most pathetic thing.
[211.82 --> 212.70]  But isn't that, like...
[212.70 --> 215.62]  Okay, everyone has, like, that computer
[215.62 --> 217.38]  that probably only works
[217.38 --> 219.38]  because they know it's, like...
[219.38 --> 220.88]  It's how to make it happy.
[220.90 --> 221.98]  It's like if you unplug the mouse
[221.98 --> 224.08]  and then replug it into a different port
[224.08 --> 226.68]  than 60% of the time.
[227.94 --> 229.52]  Every week you have to go in
[229.52 --> 232.32]  and, like, tell it to re-ignore the CPU fan header
[232.32 --> 232.86]  or whatever.
[233.02 --> 235.54]  And that's the computer that, you know,
[235.54 --> 237.70]  we hosted our live broadcast on
[237.70 --> 240.60]  because we're apparently frickin' geniuses.
[240.60 --> 240.76]  Yeah.
[241.76 --> 244.04]  We never actually claimed to be geniuses.
[244.12 --> 245.84]  Linus Media Group takes...
[245.84 --> 249.78]  makes no claims as to why we are geniuses.
[249.92 --> 250.06]  No.
[250.94 --> 253.60]  Luke, tell Linus to...
[253.60 --> 256.26]  three asterisks up.
[256.60 --> 257.56]  We want to hear you.
[257.68 --> 259.30]  He ruined the last WAN show.
[259.60 --> 260.54]  Now, hold on a second.
[260.94 --> 262.44]  This is a discussion topic.
[262.88 --> 264.14]  What curse word is that?
[264.14 --> 265.14]  Three asterisks...
[265.14 --> 266.14]  Three asterisks...
[266.98 --> 271.38]  Tell Linus to blank up.
[272.38 --> 275.36]  I wonder if it just changes all of them to three asterisks.
[275.52 --> 277.00]  Because if not, that's really weird.
[277.26 --> 278.06]  Tell Linus to...
[278.06 --> 278.80]  Because I'm just trying to think.
[278.88 --> 279.84]  Okay, F word...
[279.84 --> 282.80]  Because the F word is a pretty versatile word.
[283.22 --> 283.40]  Yep.
[283.40 --> 284.20]  Doesn't work there.
[284.26 --> 284.48]  Nope.
[284.56 --> 285.14]  You failed.
[285.38 --> 285.60]  Yep.
[286.04 --> 287.32]  So we got the SH word.
[287.54 --> 287.80]  Nope.
[287.92 --> 289.42]  Because it's very close to shut up.
[289.98 --> 290.46]  So maybe...
[290.46 --> 291.26]  Is that a new slang?
[291.38 --> 292.18]  Like, is that what we should...
[292.18 --> 293.06]  Should we start this?
[293.62 --> 294.78]  It's like...
[294.78 --> 295.60]  You know...
[295.60 --> 297.38]  You know what, son?
[298.84 --> 299.20]  Sorry?
[299.30 --> 299.92]  It's four letters.
[300.14 --> 300.44]  Oh, yeah.
[300.50 --> 301.36]  It's not even three letters.
[301.52 --> 301.74]  Yeah.
[302.00 --> 302.62]  Ass up?
[306.34 --> 307.36]  So I need to...
[307.36 --> 308.22]  Do the rest of the wedge.
[308.62 --> 308.82]  Yeah.
[309.62 --> 310.36]  Let's get it.
[311.38 --> 312.06]  There you go.
[312.20 --> 312.60]  There you go.
[312.60 --> 313.12]  Don't fall.
[313.38 --> 313.52]  Good?
[313.84 --> 314.02]  Yeah.
[314.68 --> 316.34]  Well, that's kind of your crotch.
[316.58 --> 318.20]  Well, this chair does spin.
[319.04 --> 319.28]  There you go.
[319.28 --> 322.58]  We do have these great matricomic chairs for the new office.
[322.58 --> 322.80]  Here.
[322.86 --> 323.46]  I'll move you more.
[323.58 --> 323.82]  Yeah.
[323.90 --> 324.42]  Thank you.
[325.26 --> 325.96]  There you go.
[326.34 --> 326.54]  Yeah.
[326.70 --> 327.88]  Well, I need to get a bit higher.
[328.28 --> 329.08]  Oh, it's falling.
[329.08 --> 329.50]  It's falling.
[332.98 --> 334.18]  Oh, my God.
[335.02 --> 335.42]  Okay.
[335.84 --> 336.30]  All right.
[336.48 --> 338.38]  So we still don't know what swear word that is.
[338.98 --> 339.18]  Yeah.
[339.54 --> 342.20]  We are absolutely no closer.
[343.52 --> 344.10]  What happens...
[344.10 --> 344.24]  Okay.
[344.70 --> 345.80]  If I do this...
[345.80 --> 347.58]  What are we supposed to be talking about?
[347.58 --> 350.14]  I have let you derail the show already.
[350.58 --> 351.40]  That was a plent.
[351.40 --> 351.66]  That was you.
[351.88 --> 352.72]  That was you.
[352.92 --> 353.96]  That was a plent.
[354.04 --> 355.12]  That was 100% you.
[355.18 --> 357.86]  That was an alt account from you.
[358.12 --> 358.22]  Oh.
[358.86 --> 359.26]  Bull.
[359.70 --> 359.96]  Yeah.
[360.22 --> 360.48]  Yeah.
[360.48 --> 360.78]  No.
[361.38 --> 361.84]  Bull shut.
[367.52 --> 368.04]  Sorry.
[369.32 --> 369.96]  Oh, church.
[369.96 --> 370.24]  Come on.
[370.24 --> 370.88]  That was pretty good.
[370.96 --> 371.74]  That was not bad.
[371.98 --> 372.76]  I liked that one.
[372.76 --> 373.70]  Okay.
[373.86 --> 374.44]  That was bullshit.
[374.62 --> 374.94]  Okay.
[375.48 --> 375.72]  So.
[376.18 --> 376.58]  Okay.
[376.68 --> 376.98]  Go ahead.
[377.06 --> 377.34]  Go ahead.
[377.44 --> 377.58]  Go ahead.
[377.58 --> 381.20]  New company, Alphabet, now owns Google, but it's not...
[381.20 --> 382.36]  And it's super serial.
[383.38 --> 384.70]  Oh, wow.
[384.94 --> 386.02]  That was actually pretty good.
[386.02 --> 386.88]  I'm on today.
[386.88 --> 387.28]  I like that one.
[387.28 --> 389.22]  I am on today, my friends.
[389.32 --> 393.24]  So it's actually not super serious, while it might be super serial.
[393.48 --> 394.92]  A lot of people freaked out when they read this.
[394.92 --> 395.52]  Oh, my God.
[395.54 --> 397.70]  I can't believe a company like Google could be acquired.
[397.84 --> 400.18]  And it's like, well, they were acquired by themselves.
[400.46 --> 400.58]  Yeah.
[400.80 --> 408.04]  So this is just a new parent company that they created to help kind of sub a whole bunch of
[408.04 --> 411.02]  different companies, probably for tax reasons, to be completely honest.
[411.02 --> 411.30]  Yeah.
[411.30 --> 414.98]  Or for the appearances to shareholders reasons.
[415.62 --> 415.86]  Yeah.
[415.86 --> 417.92]  So what they've effectively done is they've...
[417.92 --> 420.62]  Google is the internet stuff brand.
[420.62 --> 429.84]  So your YouTubes and your Google Chromes and your Google Maps and your Hangouts is all
[429.84 --> 431.64]  going to be under that brand.
[431.80 --> 431.96]  Yeah.
[431.98 --> 439.64]  Whereas Alphabet is also going to run sort of other bizarro land stuff like Xlabs.
[440.02 --> 440.28]  Yeah.
[440.50 --> 445.36]  And I actually don't even know what Calico Life Extension Project is.
[445.42 --> 446.52]  Do you even know what that is?
[446.60 --> 447.64]  I've heard of that.
[448.00 --> 448.34]  Okay.
[448.50 --> 449.82]  Calico Life Extension.
[449.82 --> 453.98]  His mission is to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology
[453.98 --> 454.66]  that controls.
[455.04 --> 455.98]  So basically...
[455.98 --> 456.06]  Okay.
[456.14 --> 456.60]  Oh, okay.
[456.70 --> 457.34]  That's fairly...
[457.34 --> 457.50]  Yeah.
[457.54 --> 458.12]  Life Extension.
[458.28 --> 458.42]  Yeah.
[458.42 --> 459.88]  So fairly straightforward.
[460.52 --> 465.20]  You know what's really funny about the advancements that are being made in that right now?
[465.20 --> 473.32]  So both singularity and reversing the aging process are potentially going to happen in the
[473.32 --> 474.76]  next like 100 to 200 years.
[474.92 --> 476.32]  We were that close.
[477.42 --> 478.94]  We were that freaking close.
[478.94 --> 481.98]  You and me, we're just going to grow old and die and that's it.
[482.38 --> 483.02]  That's it.
[483.68 --> 487.06]  But like our generation's kids...
[487.06 --> 488.26]  I know you're not planning to have kids.
[488.28 --> 488.70]  Do you have a problem with that?
[489.60 --> 491.84]  It feels like it kind of sucks.
[492.40 --> 493.64]  Because you know like...
[493.64 --> 499.54]  But on the other hand, I mean there's a lot of issues with people living forever that
[499.54 --> 501.86]  are not easily resolvable.
[501.86 --> 503.76]  And I think like this is going...
[503.76 --> 504.94]  Like just the amount of them?
[505.58 --> 507.92]  Not just the amount of them.
[508.18 --> 509.50]  Because that's actually a pretty big problem.
[509.74 --> 509.98]  But...
[510.54 --> 511.06]  Okay.
[511.14 --> 512.04]  Amount of them...
[512.04 --> 517.82]  I actually think particularly at the beginning, the amount...
[517.82 --> 518.20]  Excuse me.
[518.20 --> 522.72]  The amount of people living forever will almost be a non-issue.
[523.30 --> 524.22]  At the beginning, yeah.
[524.34 --> 529.28]  Because it's going to be so expensive that it's going to be a whole other issue of only
[529.28 --> 531.58]  the rich and powerful being able to...
[531.58 --> 534.94]  So it's one thing if the rich and powerful can drive like a sweet car.
[534.94 --> 537.26]  Poor people live forever and poor people die.
[537.38 --> 537.88]  Just...
[537.88 --> 538.50]  Exactly.
[538.78 --> 539.08]  Ooh.
[539.72 --> 542.08]  And if that is not like...
[542.08 --> 543.94]  And if it's not a rat race now...
[545.12 --> 550.94]  It's like nowadays, like if you're rich, you're like, yeah, Freedom 55 or whatever.
[551.16 --> 552.06]  You retire young.
[552.98 --> 553.36]  No.
[553.50 --> 554.74]  That's a whole other thing.
[554.84 --> 558.98]  So now it's like climb over the backs of your fellow human beings.
[558.98 --> 562.80]  Are you able to make enough money so that you can not die?
[562.80 --> 565.28]  Instead of are you able to make enough money so that you can retire?
[565.32 --> 569.74]  And then if you're not going to die, well, do you have to work forever then, I guess?
[570.34 --> 570.92]  For like...
[570.92 --> 572.02]  Because you can bet.
[572.10 --> 574.50]  And I mean, this is some tinfoil hat stuff.
[574.58 --> 576.86]  So if you're not into tinfoil hat, peace.
[577.00 --> 577.62]  See you later.
[578.26 --> 588.38]  But can you imagine the first life extender solution being, you know, a shot that you
[588.38 --> 590.22]  take once and then your life is extended forever?
[591.00 --> 591.40]  No.
[591.56 --> 591.84]  No.
[591.84 --> 595.00]  It's going to be a pill that you buy and you take every day.
[595.52 --> 595.56]  Yeah.
[595.66 --> 597.78]  And even if they had the other solution...
[597.78 --> 598.60]  Or even more hardcore than that.
[598.70 --> 604.60]  There's no way that anyone is going to give you the shot in the arm that reverses the aging
[604.60 --> 605.46]  process of yourselves.
[605.68 --> 609.00]  And there's going to be a whole bunch of other issues with living together...
[609.00 --> 609.78]  Or living together.
[610.34 --> 611.20]  With living together.
[612.16 --> 612.66]  We'll work hard.
[612.66 --> 613.18]  We won't have...
[613.18 --> 614.58]  We'll work hard at it.
[614.68 --> 615.62]  Stay together for the kids.
[615.62 --> 617.56]  With living forever.
[617.56 --> 620.64]  Like, your teeth are not going to reverse their aging process.
[620.64 --> 627.88]  So you're going to be like this weird, reconstructed creature in certain ways.
[627.88 --> 633.64]  And I'd be floored if they figure out how to reverse the aging process of everything.
[633.64 --> 635.26]  So your eyesight...
[635.26 --> 638.12]  You're going to have like this super like old man eyesight.
[638.74 --> 641.16]  I mean, with that said, they've got those new contacts coming.
[641.36 --> 641.58]  And whatever.
[641.58 --> 642.32]  And you're hearing.
[642.58 --> 642.92]  Hearing.
[642.92 --> 646.98]  When they're working on stem cells and stuff, what if they can grow you a new body and you
[646.98 --> 647.82]  just brain transplant?
[647.82 --> 649.34]  Well, that's a whole...
[649.34 --> 649.80]  Word.
[650.02 --> 651.04]  That's been tackled.
[651.22 --> 653.10]  Like, that's some crazy stuff.
[653.20 --> 654.18]  Like, I forget what...
[654.18 --> 656.36]  There's like some book, and I think it's a movie or something.
[656.36 --> 657.36]  The dog or something.
[657.48 --> 662.46]  No, the parents have like a terminally ill kid.
[662.56 --> 663.96]  Like a degenerative disease kid.
[664.00 --> 666.60]  And then they have another kid that's basically like spare parts.
[666.82 --> 668.48]  Or something along those lines.
[668.72 --> 669.46]  Or whatever.
[669.78 --> 672.48]  Like, that's some crazy next level stuff.
[672.50 --> 677.02]  Yes, but I don't mean like birthing a new child and using them as spare parts.
[677.02 --> 678.72]  Which we've seen in, I think, more than one movie.
[678.80 --> 679.42]  Yeah, that's been done.
[680.40 --> 684.56]  I'm talking about like no brain, grow a body in a lab.
[684.56 --> 685.70]  Stem cell style.
[686.40 --> 689.36]  Yeah, but see, that becomes a very tricky question.
[689.56 --> 697.84]  And like, religious arguments aside, the conversation about what makes something a human is an incredibly
[697.84 --> 698.78]  complicated one.
[699.14 --> 701.82]  I thought someone just called this autism the show.
[702.36 --> 703.34]  And I was like, what?
[703.34 --> 703.64]  What?
[703.96 --> 707.80]  What is it that we're talking about that made you say something like that?
[708.52 --> 710.26]  Anyway, so sorry.
[710.38 --> 711.52]  Sorry, back on topic.
[711.82 --> 713.06]  What makes something a human?
[713.16 --> 713.78]  Is it a body?
[714.02 --> 715.30]  Is it a soul?
[715.46 --> 716.40]  Do we have a soul?
[716.54 --> 717.96]  These are all questions that...
[717.96 --> 718.98]  We're not going to get into.
[719.04 --> 721.76]  That we're not going to be able to answer.
[721.90 --> 724.36]  Because we don't actually have an answer yet.
[724.38 --> 729.58]  If you can transfer a consciousness, you know, if you believe in a soul, then have you also
[729.58 --> 730.42]  transferred the soul?
[730.42 --> 731.36]  Did the soul die?
[731.44 --> 732.46]  Is it now an abomination?
[732.96 --> 733.84]  Who knows?
[734.90 --> 736.72]  So would you want to live forever?
[737.12 --> 737.98]  I don't know.
[738.98 --> 740.00]  I think it depends.
[740.00 --> 740.30]  I don't know.
[741.48 --> 744.24]  I feel like I would because I'm constantly interested in things.
[745.06 --> 747.62]  And I'd be like, ooh, technology moved on and changed.
[747.86 --> 750.32]  Now, this is another really interesting way of looking at it.
[750.34 --> 753.34]  Is it worth it to live forever if everyone around you dies?
[753.34 --> 753.42]  Yes.
[753.86 --> 758.60]  And what if you were rich enough to keep yourself alive...
[758.60 --> 759.24]  But not...
[759.24 --> 759.88]  But not...
[759.88 --> 765.38]  Let's say you and your wife had to decide who can afford the, like, Uber treatment.
[765.56 --> 767.30]  I don't know if I could claim that for myself.
[768.68 --> 769.88]  So that's exactly okay.
[769.88 --> 772.02]  Knowing how I do things, I'd probably pass it.
[772.04 --> 773.54]  So then let's talk...
[773.54 --> 775.54]  Well, then, but what if the other...
[775.54 --> 777.02]  Because, I mean, you see all these...
[777.02 --> 778.28]  The other person wants to pass it.
[778.30 --> 778.52]  Right.
[778.66 --> 780.90]  So what if old...
[780.90 --> 781.98]  You know how old people walk in...
[781.98 --> 784.16]  The most epic game of rock, paper, scissors.
[786.52 --> 788.18]  Rock, paper, scissors, death.
[788.34 --> 788.94]  You'd win.
[789.16 --> 789.56]  Oh!
[789.56 --> 789.76]  Oh!
[790.00 --> 790.36]  Oh!
[790.36 --> 790.56]  Oh!
[790.56 --> 790.68]  Oh!
[790.68 --> 790.96]  Oh!
[790.96 --> 791.24]  Oh!
[791.24 --> 791.52]  Oh!
[791.52 --> 792.46]  Oh my God!
[793.52 --> 796.94]  So, like, would you want to leave behind all your brothers and sisters?
[797.72 --> 797.98]  Right.
[798.04 --> 798.64]  You know what I mean?
[798.88 --> 799.14]  Yeah.
[799.24 --> 801.86]  And if you had kids, like, like, like, get this.
[801.94 --> 803.92]  Would you prefer to pass it down to your kids?
[804.46 --> 808.68]  And then if, like, like, what if there was, like, your family could only afford, like, one fortune?
[808.80 --> 810.54]  What if you could only keep one person alive?
[810.72 --> 811.54]  And remember...
[811.54 --> 811.78]  That's insane.
[811.88 --> 813.54]  No anti-aging treatment...
[813.54 --> 814.00]  No, I'm not married.
[814.10 --> 815.12]  He was saying conceptually.
[815.32 --> 815.52]  Yeah.
[815.52 --> 822.46]  No anti-aging treatment is gonna, you know, prevent you from smashing your head open on a rock if you're climbing it.
[822.54 --> 822.64]  Yeah.
[822.64 --> 822.70]  Yeah.
[822.92 --> 825.92]  So, there's no guarantee that it's even gonna work anyway.
[826.04 --> 826.88]  This isn't, uh...
[826.88 --> 828.12]  What's that awesome movie?
[828.22 --> 829.04]  Death Becomes Her.
[829.10 --> 832.70]  We need, like, Windows Server automatic nightly backup for brains.
[834.48 --> 837.80]  I suspect it would happen eventually.
[838.32 --> 841.74]  And you just download into a new body.
[842.02 --> 845.10]  There's gotta be a way, like, even if you can't 100% it,
[845.52 --> 849.80]  if it could get extremely close.
[851.10 --> 851.50]  Okay.
[852.56 --> 853.82]  Here's a tough one for you.
[853.82 --> 854.22]  Are you the same person?
[854.30 --> 854.48]  No.
[854.70 --> 855.78]  If they could...
[855.78 --> 856.78]  Okay, well, no, I know.
[856.86 --> 857.00]  Yeah.
[857.08 --> 858.30]  But tell me this, then.
[858.84 --> 861.30]  If your hypothetical wife...
[861.30 --> 861.56]  It's like people lines for you.
[861.72 --> 865.36]  If your hypothetical wife was downloaded to a server somewhere...
[865.36 --> 865.54]  Yeah.
[865.88 --> 866.98]  She dies...
[866.98 --> 867.22]  Yeah.
[867.40 --> 869.28]  ...and she gets rebooted, is...
[869.28 --> 870.24]  Are you married still?
[872.24 --> 873.08]  Oh, my God.
[873.48 --> 874.30]  Oh, my God.
[874.30 --> 876.30]  Uh...
[877.30 --> 881.28]  I think you would have to choose that legally before.
[881.80 --> 882.12]  Before.
[882.42 --> 886.02]  So I think you'd have to, like, sign a thing being like, yes or no.
[886.02 --> 888.22]  This is gonna be a whole new level of prenup, kids.
[888.34 --> 888.58]  Because when people...
[888.58 --> 888.72]  Yeah.
[889.28 --> 894.58]  When people are potentially married till death do us part...
[894.58 --> 895.74]  Hold on a second.
[895.74 --> 897.42]  So when you get married for, like, thousands of years...
[897.42 --> 903.28]  So it will become cheaper to kill your spouse and reboot them than to divorce.
[905.78 --> 907.24]  And reboot them.
[907.62 --> 908.70]  Oh, my God.
[909.04 --> 909.84]  Oh, man.
[909.84 --> 910.34]  You're right, though.
[910.34 --> 911.64]  It's like, hun, this isn't working.
[912.50 --> 913.06]  All right.
[913.20 --> 915.92]  Let's suicide pact reformat our lives.
[915.92 --> 918.86]  Okay, do you still have your job?
[919.50 --> 919.72]  Right?
[919.98 --> 922.94]  I guess that would have to probably be in your employment agreement.
[922.94 --> 923.86]  If you die...
[923.86 --> 925.56]  If you died, would I even know?
[927.02 --> 927.64]  I'd be like...
[927.64 --> 928.14]  You'd show up again.
[928.14 --> 929.70]  I'd be like you shaved and you're bald.
[930.04 --> 931.82]  Because, like, you don't have your hair yet, right?
[932.32 --> 933.50]  Because it has to die.
[933.92 --> 934.62]  Oh, man.
[935.28 --> 936.80]  She's like, why do you shave your head?
[936.80 --> 939.92]  I don't know, Linus.
[940.10 --> 940.92]  And you're like, what?
[945.56 --> 946.52]  Minor changes.
[948.08 --> 950.84]  It's like, you come in and you're like...
[950.84 --> 953.04]  You're like, you know, like...
[953.04 --> 954.32]  Never mind.
[955.54 --> 957.44]  You're like a bottom guy all of a sudden.
[961.36 --> 962.66]  Oh, I thought you meant that differently.
[962.88 --> 963.40]  I get it.
[965.76 --> 966.46]  Never mind.
[966.46 --> 967.54]  I didn't get it at first.
[968.86 --> 972.28]  Okay, so one tricky thing, sorry, back on topic,
[972.44 --> 975.84]  about the whole Google breaking itself apart
[975.84 --> 977.80]  into sub-companies under Alphabet...
[977.80 --> 978.34]  No, we can't change it.
[978.42 --> 982.20]  ...is that they will still go by the stock tickers
[982.20 --> 985.68]  of G-O-O-G-L and G-O-O-G,
[985.80 --> 987.46]  so they're still going to trade under their old name.
[989.82 --> 992.46]  And, yeah, I guess...
[993.26 --> 994.82]  There's really not that much to say.
[994.82 --> 996.16]  I know I say that a lot.
[996.16 --> 999.92]  But, like, this is really not that interesting news.
[1000.12 --> 1001.92]  And the internet exploded about it.
[1001.92 --> 1006.12]  Yeah, so their actual landing page, ABC.xyz,
[1006.44 --> 1009.48]  received over 1.9 million views after the announcement.
[1009.74 --> 1011.86]  And the funny thing is Alphabet.com,
[1011.92 --> 1013.74]  which Google actually doesn't own,
[1014.44 --> 1017.18]  and wouldn't it be an insignificant thing
[1017.18 --> 1019.20]  for Google to try to acquire since BMW,
[1019.60 --> 1021.92]  sort of another global brand, owns it?
[1021.92 --> 1024.56]  It's actually their, like, business-oriented,
[1024.88 --> 1028.98]  like, corporate customer vehicle supply,
[1029.56 --> 1032.18]  you know, fleet management leasing thing.
[1032.74 --> 1035.40]  So BMW owns Alphabet.com,
[1035.48 --> 1039.04]  and they are apparently looking into trademark implications,
[1039.04 --> 1046.40]  but don't intend to take legal action against Google.
[1046.66 --> 1049.58]  Yeah, unless they probably need to in order to keep their stuff.
[1049.80 --> 1052.20]  This was posted by Blade of Grass on the forum.
[1052.28 --> 1053.46]  Did you ever post the link in the chat?
[1053.68 --> 1054.22]  No, I did not.
[1054.22 --> 1056.40]  Okay, so go ahead and drop that in there.
[1056.46 --> 1057.46]  The next article is,
[1057.82 --> 1059.72]  Tesla is burning cash.
[1059.82 --> 1061.68]  This is not exactly,
[1061.68 --> 1064.76]  this is not exactly groundbreaking either.
[1065.12 --> 1068.44]  It costs a metric butt-ton of money to develop cars.
[1068.54 --> 1070.08]  Just ask anyone who makes cars.
[1070.58 --> 1075.14]  And Tesla is basically doing it without the sales
[1075.14 --> 1077.66]  to support what they're trying to do over here.
[1077.76 --> 1079.80]  Well, they're losing money per car.
[1079.94 --> 1080.22]  Yes.
[1080.78 --> 1082.40]  Not only.
[1082.40 --> 1084.86]  Do they only have, like,
[1085.56 --> 1087.36]  so let's see how many Model S's,
[1087.46 --> 1089.04]  the one that matters, we can sell.
[1089.48 --> 1091.74]  They're actually losing somewhere in the neighborhood
[1091.74 --> 1096.22]  of $4,000 to about $15,000 per car,
[1096.60 --> 1098.96]  depending on how you crunch the numbers.
[1098.96 --> 1101.58]  If you look at Elon Musk's business history,
[1101.88 --> 1104.02]  this is super not surprising.
[1104.54 --> 1105.62]  When PayPal first started,
[1105.72 --> 1107.64]  he was paying people to open accounts.
[1107.90 --> 1110.64]  He would put real money in your account
[1110.64 --> 1111.70]  when you opened one.
[1111.70 --> 1113.00]  There's a lot of sites that'll be like,
[1113.08 --> 1115.68]  you get credit on the site when you open an account.
[1115.90 --> 1119.34]  No, he was putting cash money that you could spend elsewhere
[1119.34 --> 1122.68]  that he would not get credit for when you opened an account.
[1122.78 --> 1123.86]  And it was not small.
[1123.96 --> 1125.18]  I don't remember how much it was,
[1125.24 --> 1125.86]  but it was like,
[1126.68 --> 1128.12]  you could go buy something,
[1128.34 --> 1128.72]  probably,
[1128.72 --> 1130.74]  with the amount of money they would put in your account.
[1131.18 --> 1133.66]  So he's buying market share.
[1134.64 --> 1134.84]  Yep.
[1135.30 --> 1135.74]  Effectively.
[1136.10 --> 1138.02]  And yeah, it's still expensive,
[1138.40 --> 1138.92]  and that's,
[1139.14 --> 1140.00]  but that's kind of life,
[1140.06 --> 1142.26]  because they cost a lot of money to make.
[1142.44 --> 1142.52]  So,
[1143.02 --> 1144.98]  this is great.
[1145.08 --> 1147.22]  So they've actually burned through,
[1147.72 --> 1152.62]  they've $359 million in cash last quarter.
[1152.62 --> 1153.62]  Wow.
[1154.82 --> 1158.54]  And this combined with the production target cuts for 2016,
[1159.20 --> 1164.02]  doesn't bode that well for their 500,000 car production target by 2020.
[1164.38 --> 1167.80]  So they have a mere 1.15 billion on hand,
[1167.96 --> 1171.64]  so enough to run for another three quarters at the rate they're going.
[1172.00 --> 1175.94]  This is down from 2.67 billion one year ago.
[1175.94 --> 1176.44]  So yeah,
[1176.44 --> 1178.76]  the rate at which they're burning through it is pretty consistent,
[1179.22 --> 1180.84]  and not going to last them much longer.
[1180.96 --> 1181.22]  And then,
[1181.52 --> 1189.56]  the article from Reuters actually estimated that a new car can cost 1 billion or more to engineer and bring to market.
[1190.38 --> 1190.86]  So,
[1191.20 --> 1194.26]  that reduction in cash looks like development on,
[1194.32 --> 1194.44]  well,
[1194.52 --> 1195.96]  we know they're working on other cars.
[1196.08 --> 1197.58]  They're working on the Model X,
[1197.70 --> 1198.44]  and the Model 3,
[1198.52 --> 1198.96]  excuse me,
[1199.22 --> 1199.64]  oh,
[1199.76 --> 1200.84]  I meant to say E,
[1200.94 --> 1201.38]  excuse me,
[1201.44 --> 1201.62]  three,
[1201.78 --> 1202.68]  but whatever.
[1203.14 --> 1204.20]  The Model 3.
[1204.20 --> 1205.44]  So,
[1205.60 --> 1210.06]  Musk says there might be some value in raising capital as they move into 2016,
[1210.44 --> 1216.74]  where they are expected to increase their spending due to the Model 3 and the Gigafactory.
[1217.50 --> 1217.82]  So,
[1218.02 --> 1218.88]  yeah,
[1219.08 --> 1222.10]  we'll see how this whole thing plays out.
[1222.18 --> 1222.48]  I mean,
[1222.80 --> 1223.38]  realistically,
[1223.38 --> 1223.74]  Honestly,
[1223.80 --> 1224.42]  I think they're fine.
[1225.16 --> 1225.60]  Realistically,
[1226.02 --> 1227.74]  if Tesla is straight up like,
[1227.92 --> 1228.06]  yep,
[1228.10 --> 1229.32]  we're doing another round of funding,
[1229.58 --> 1234.16]  I don't think there will be any shortage of backers to try and get in,
[1234.20 --> 1234.88]  on this one.
[1234.92 --> 1235.40]  I think they'll be fine.
[1235.56 --> 1236.96]  And they will be fine,
[1237.10 --> 1237.20]  but,
[1237.20 --> 1238.70]  They might have to do another round of funding.
[1239.44 --> 1239.94]  I mean,
[1240.00 --> 1247.20]  it's really interesting to see why it is then that the incumbent automakers aren't just going head to head with Tesla.
[1247.70 --> 1248.10]  It's like,
[1248.18 --> 1248.32]  well,
[1248.38 --> 1252.22]  why aren't they just matching Tesla's investment into electric cars?
[1252.22 --> 1252.52]  Well,
[1252.62 --> 1256.54]  because even if you're BMW or Audi,
[1257.76 --> 1258.80]  it's a lot of money.
[1259.04 --> 1259.28]  It is,
[1259.36 --> 1259.58]  yeah.
[1259.78 --> 1262.32]  And unlike a fledgling company,
[1262.44 --> 1262.56]  I mean,
[1262.60 --> 1264.38]  Tesla's still a really young company.
[1264.56 --> 1266.02]  Unlike a fledgling company,
[1266.48 --> 1272.78]  an established company with established shareholders that expect to get their established benefits from being shareholders,
[1272.78 --> 1273.06]  there's,
[1274.02 --> 1281.04]  you're going to have to sell the idea of just spending money hand over fist on an unproven,
[1281.14 --> 1286.46]  although I think we're pretty close to it being a foregone conclusion that electric cars are going to be a thing,
[1286.46 --> 1289.34]  but on an unproven market where you don't have,
[1289.48 --> 1289.62]  well,
[1289.72 --> 1294.14]  here's the last 50 years of sales and market data.
[1294.34 --> 1294.72]  The car,
[1294.82 --> 1296.44]  the auto industry doesn't move that fast.
[1296.68 --> 1297.92]  It really doesn't.
[1298.00 --> 1298.76]  It's kind of sad.
[1299.32 --> 1301.70]  This was posted by Snow Comet on the forum.
[1301.82 --> 1307.92]  I'm going to fire up Lenovo.com where we are going to learn about actually a pretty cool,
[1307.98 --> 1310.04]  pretty cool little release.
[1310.14 --> 1311.06]  You want to handle this puppy?
[1311.94 --> 1313.88]  I have read zero of these topics.
[1314.54 --> 1314.78]  Oh,
[1315.28 --> 1315.52]  oh,
[1315.52 --> 1315.90]  that's right.
[1315.90 --> 1317.30]  You were working on the Ultimaker,
[1317.66 --> 1318.82]  Ultimaker two thing today.
[1319.04 --> 1319.74]  And filming two videos.
[1319.84 --> 1320.08]  Well,
[1320.28 --> 1320.70]  okay.
[1321.24 --> 1322.36]  And getting new internet.
[1322.50 --> 1322.94]  You know what?
[1323.24 --> 1323.64]  Yeah.
[1324.82 --> 1326.16]  Super stoked.
[1326.86 --> 1327.18]  Right.
[1327.30 --> 1328.50]  You have new internet at your house now,
[1328.58 --> 1328.70]  right?
[1329.34 --> 1329.74]  Yes.
[1330.06 --> 1331.60]  Also have internet at my house.
[1331.68 --> 1333.46]  That's a pretty important part of that sentence.
[1333.86 --> 1335.22]  I haven't had internet for a while.
[1335.38 --> 1335.52]  Yeah.
[1335.56 --> 1339.18]  And then they were supposed to come today and they came at one of the least opportune times.
[1339.72 --> 1341.56]  It would have been worse if they came during WAN show.
[1341.66 --> 1342.28]  That is true.
[1342.66 --> 1343.58]  If you were just like,
[1343.58 --> 1344.00]  peace,
[1344.00 --> 1345.06]  I need to go get internet.
[1345.06 --> 1345.74]  I'd be like,
[1346.20 --> 1346.46]  yeah,
[1346.52 --> 1346.98]  I get it.
[1346.98 --> 1349.48]  Because if I didn't have internet at my house,
[1349.64 --> 1352.30]  I would basically be living at the office,
[1352.42 --> 1352.92]  same as you.
[1353.62 --> 1354.76]  That was pretty good timing.
[1354.76 --> 1355.64]  Because honestly,
[1355.82 --> 1357.00]  even if I had internet,
[1357.22 --> 1358.46]  I wasn't going to be leaving.
[1358.86 --> 1360.60]  I needed to get that print working.
[1360.60 --> 1361.46]  So,
[1361.58 --> 1361.82]  like,
[1361.88 --> 1363.72]  I wasn't on the computer using the internet.
[1364.02 --> 1365.00]  I was working on the,
[1365.06 --> 1365.22]  like,
[1365.28 --> 1366.02]  my feet hurt.
[1366.50 --> 1366.74]  Right.
[1366.78 --> 1367.80]  Because it's on a standing desk.
[1367.92 --> 1370.30]  And I was working on it for so long.
[1371.04 --> 1372.78]  I'm looking forward to watching that review.
[1372.88 --> 1375.34]  Because I have spent almost no time with the Ultimaker.
[1375.34 --> 1375.88]  I,
[1376.02 --> 1376.14]  like,
[1376.22 --> 1376.56]  legit,
[1376.66 --> 1378.26]  don't want anyone else printing off of it.
[1378.66 --> 1379.62]  People can make models,
[1379.72 --> 1381.08]  people can find whatever models they want,
[1381.16 --> 1382.92]  and then I'll do the printing part.
[1383.20 --> 1383.72]  There's some,
[1383.72 --> 1384.56]  there's some trickiness.
[1384.72 --> 1385.16]  There's some,
[1385.24 --> 1385.76]  and like,
[1385.98 --> 1386.18]  the,
[1386.64 --> 1388.62]  I think it was five or six,
[1389.20 --> 1389.80]  I don't remember,
[1389.94 --> 1391.86]  it's five to six and a half hours last night
[1391.86 --> 1392.66]  where I was just troubleshooting.
[1393.10 --> 1393.46]  Wow.
[1393.58 --> 1393.76]  Straight.
[1394.24 --> 1396.40]  So I learned a lot about the printer.
[1396.52 --> 1397.56]  I heard from the Twitch chat
[1397.56 --> 1399.12]  that they basically walked you through it.
[1400.80 --> 1401.20]  Morph,
[1401.50 --> 1402.06]  Morph,
[1402.06 --> 1402.34]  Morph,
[1402.34 --> 1403.06]  Morphine D,
[1403.06 --> 1404.30]  he helped a lot.
[1404.46 --> 1404.72]  Okay.
[1404.88 --> 1405.12]  Yeah.
[1405.76 --> 1406.04]  All right.
[1406.08 --> 1406.18]  Well,
[1406.20 --> 1407.22]  maybe that's what people were saying.
[1407.36 --> 1410.14]  So Lenovo ushers in a new era
[1410.14 --> 1412.32]  of mobile workstation power
[1412.32 --> 1413.66]  and performance
[1413.66 --> 1416.82]  with the ThinkPad P50 and P70.
[1417.18 --> 1419.24]  So they're not the first ones
[1419.24 --> 1421.58]  to try and build a mobile workstation.
[1422.26 --> 1423.02]  At all.
[1423.38 --> 1423.54]  No.
[1423.68 --> 1424.02]  Like,
[1424.70 --> 1425.64]  at all.
[1425.74 --> 1426.26]  But,
[1426.94 --> 1429.18]  but these ones are definitely
[1429.18 --> 1430.36]  the most powerful
[1430.36 --> 1432.08]  and badass looking ones
[1432.08 --> 1432.98]  that we've ever seen.
[1433.06 --> 1435.34]  So the P70 is the 17-inch model.
[1435.42 --> 1437.32]  The P50 is the 15-inch model.
[1437.84 --> 1439.96]  And the P70 is loaded up
[1439.96 --> 1444.16]  with 64 gigs of ECC DDR4 memory.
[1444.30 --> 1445.30]  It can handle up to a terabyte
[1445.30 --> 1447.00]  of SSD storage over PCI Express
[1447.00 --> 1450.66]  and up to four storage devices.
[1450.66 --> 1455.08]  It also comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports.
[1455.66 --> 1458.76]  So Thunderbolt 3 is 40 gigabit per second,
[1458.94 --> 1460.12]  if I recall correctly.
[1460.12 --> 1461.32]  Five gigabyte.
[1462.12 --> 1462.60]  Sorry?
[1462.86 --> 1463.58]  Five gigabyte.
[1464.76 --> 1465.66]  Yeah, thereabouts.
[1465.94 --> 1468.66]  And is USB-C,
[1468.90 --> 1470.32]  is a USB-C connector
[1470.32 --> 1471.38]  or something along those lines.
[1471.58 --> 1473.88]  I actually haven't looked into it enough.
[1474.00 --> 1476.42]  Yeah, it's through a USB 3 type-C connector.
[1476.82 --> 1476.84]  So,
[1477.84 --> 1478.02]  well,
[1478.02 --> 1478.80]  okay,
[1478.80 --> 1480.54]  that's one thing that doesn't,
[1481.06 --> 1481.70]  can you not,
[1481.88 --> 1482.30]  thank you.
[1482.48 --> 1484.30]  That's one thing that I wish I could adjust
[1484.30 --> 1485.18]  or maybe I can
[1485.18 --> 1485.96]  and I haven't yet,
[1486.34 --> 1488.24]  but the snapping aggressiveness
[1488.24 --> 1489.68]  in the latest versions of XSplit,
[1489.76 --> 1491.06]  it's nice to be able
[1491.06 --> 1493.20]  to move things around freely,
[1493.42 --> 1495.14]  but I wish it would snap
[1495.14 --> 1496.28]  a little bit more decisively.
[1496.28 --> 1496.34]  Yeah.
[1496.50 --> 1496.96]  Decisively.
[1497.10 --> 1497.24]  Yeah.
[1497.40 --> 1497.98]  So there you go.
[1498.04 --> 1499.36]  That's what the connector looks like.
[1499.42 --> 1501.94]  This is on ThunderboltTechnology.net.
[1502.74 --> 1503.38]  This is great.
[1503.70 --> 1504.32]  More speed,
[1504.44 --> 1505.00]  more pixels,
[1505.16 --> 1505.82]  more power,
[1506.08 --> 1506.86]  more protocols.
[1507.54 --> 1508.02]  Displayport,
[1508.12 --> 1508.74]  PCIe,
[1508.84 --> 1509.22]  Thunderbolt,
[1509.36 --> 1510.84]  and USB 3 super speed.
[1510.90 --> 1511.50]  It can also deliver
[1511.50 --> 1513.00]  up to 100 watts of power
[1513.00 --> 1516.12]  and two 4K displays.
[1516.50 --> 1516.82]  So epic.
[1517.10 --> 1518.68]  So that is some pretty
[1518.68 --> 1520.62]  BA technology.
[1521.52 --> 1523.06]  So it'll come with that
[1523.06 --> 1525.02]  and what else is there
[1525.02 --> 1526.94]  to really say about it?
[1527.04 --> 1528.00]  A Xeon CPU,
[1528.26 --> 1529.02]  you're going to need that
[1529.02 --> 1530.52]  for that ECC memory support
[1530.52 --> 1531.92]  and then they also feature
[1531.92 --> 1533.18]  Quadro GPUs,
[1533.22 --> 1535.96]  but I don't see exact models
[1535.96 --> 1537.06]  and these aren't going to be available
[1537.06 --> 1538.22]  until Q4 2015,
[1538.44 --> 1540.36]  although I have already reached out
[1540.36 --> 1540.82]  to Lenovo
[1540.82 --> 1542.08]  and we are already confirmed
[1542.08 --> 1543.16]  to be getting a review sample.
[1543.54 --> 1543.90]  Nice.
[1544.14 --> 1545.94]  So we can check it out in person
[1545.94 --> 1547.68]  and I'll let you guys know
[1547.68 --> 1548.72]  what's up.
[1549.06 --> 1549.92]  Because let's face it,
[1549.94 --> 1551.04]  there's a lot of powerful laptops
[1551.04 --> 1551.54]  out there,
[1551.60 --> 1552.46]  but there's a difference
[1552.46 --> 1553.64]  between a workstation
[1553.64 --> 1556.12]  and just any old laptop
[1556.12 --> 1556.88]  or notebook.
[1557.24 --> 1558.40]  This is a great topic
[1558.40 --> 1558.92]  of discussion.
[1559.06 --> 1559.68]  Did you know
[1559.68 --> 1561.44]  that there is a difference
[1561.44 --> 1562.38]  between a laptop
[1562.38 --> 1563.26]  and a notebook?
[1565.02 --> 1565.46]  No.
[1565.68 --> 1566.74]  They are not the same thing.
[1567.00 --> 1567.78]  I didn't know that.
[1567.80 --> 1568.02]  Yep.
[1568.14 --> 1569.10]  The amount of crap
[1569.10 --> 1570.20]  that I've gotten about this
[1570.20 --> 1571.76]  from one of our particular partners
[1571.76 --> 1573.22]  every time I say the wrong one
[1573.22 --> 1575.52]  is significant.
[1576.28 --> 1577.18]  What's the difference?
[1577.92 --> 1578.34]  So,
[1578.66 --> 1580.82]  the irony is that
[1580.82 --> 1581.64]  neither of them
[1581.64 --> 1582.86]  is intended to run in your lap.
[1583.40 --> 1584.66]  That was done away with
[1584.66 --> 1585.74]  a very long time ago
[1585.74 --> 1587.36]  when heat existed.
[1587.36 --> 1591.04]  a laptop
[1591.04 --> 1593.82]  is larger and bulkier
[1593.82 --> 1595.80]  but smaller than
[1595.80 --> 1596.96]  a desktop replacement.
[1598.08 --> 1598.52]  Okay.
[1598.78 --> 1599.20]  Okay.
[1599.92 --> 1600.84]  A notebook
[1600.84 --> 1601.96]  is smaller
[1601.96 --> 1603.84]  but not an ultra book.
[1605.74 --> 1606.76]  And I was like,
[1607.00 --> 1609.26]  okay.
[1609.26 --> 1609.82]  Okay.
[1609.82 --> 1611.00]  That's kind of what I expected.
[1611.14 --> 1611.48]  I was going to say
[1611.48 --> 1612.46]  notebook is going to have
[1612.46 --> 1613.22]  to be a smaller one.
[1613.34 --> 1613.74]  So,
[1613.90 --> 1615.20]  this is kind of a notebook
[1615.20 --> 1616.66]  because of its size
[1616.66 --> 1618.24]  but I think in terms
[1618.24 --> 1619.34]  of its power
[1619.34 --> 1620.14]  it would be more
[1620.14 --> 1620.88]  of a laptop.
[1623.24 --> 1624.38]  But this is a notebook.
[1624.46 --> 1625.60]  That's an ultra book.
[1626.72 --> 1627.16]  Sorry,
[1627.28 --> 1627.62]  one second.
[1627.62 --> 1629.22]  The definition of ultra book
[1629.22 --> 1631.10]  is a little flexible
[1631.10 --> 1632.06]  depending on
[1632.06 --> 1632.82]  whether it
[1632.82 --> 1634.54]  is a two-in-one
[1634.54 --> 1635.38]  which used to be called
[1635.38 --> 1636.10]  a convertible.
[1636.32 --> 1636.52]  So,
[1636.58 --> 1637.30]  this one has like
[1637.30 --> 1638.16]  a tablet mode.
[1638.90 --> 1639.26]  So,
[1639.80 --> 1640.08]  yeah.
[1640.14 --> 1640.66]  There you go.
[1640.74 --> 1641.96]  If you guys didn't know that
[1641.96 --> 1642.50]  then you learned
[1642.50 --> 1644.40]  a completely useless
[1644.40 --> 1645.82]  fact today.
[1646.46 --> 1647.08]  Dun-dun-dun!
[1647.58 --> 1649.00]  As Burkle is so
[1649.00 --> 1649.96]  fond of doing.
[1650.30 --> 1651.50]  Speaking of Burkle,
[1651.94 --> 1652.62]  oh man,
[1652.62 --> 1654.64]  he has outdone himself
[1654.64 --> 1656.44]  on the car painting
[1656.44 --> 1657.44]  video.
[1657.84 --> 1658.70]  That's over
[1658.70 --> 1659.76]  on Vessel
[1659.76 --> 1660.72]  right now
[1660.72 --> 1661.70]  and it's going to be
[1661.70 --> 1662.50]  coming to YouTube
[1662.50 --> 1663.80]  sometime next week.
[1664.18 --> 1664.98]  But if you guys
[1664.98 --> 1666.10]  have a Vessel membership,
[1666.74 --> 1667.80]  a surprising number
[1667.80 --> 1668.24]  of our viewers
[1668.24 --> 1669.32]  actually don't know
[1669.32 --> 1670.34]  that Channel Super Fun
[1670.34 --> 1672.58]  is also over on Vessel.
[1672.70 --> 1673.48]  It's not just
[1673.48 --> 1674.22]  Linus Tech Tips.
[1674.38 --> 1674.88]  Tech Quickie
[1674.88 --> 1675.60]  and Channel Super Fun
[1675.60 --> 1676.24]  are both there.
[1676.70 --> 1677.96]  But this is
[1677.96 --> 1679.82]  something else.
[1679.94 --> 1681.12]  This car painting video.
[1684.66 --> 1685.62]  I think I'm about
[1685.62 --> 1686.60]  to show an ad
[1686.60 --> 1687.52]  so I'll just
[1687.52 --> 1688.40]  put that away
[1688.40 --> 1688.76]  for now
[1688.76 --> 1689.16]  so you guys
[1689.16 --> 1689.60]  don't have to
[1689.60 --> 1690.14]  listen to that
[1690.14 --> 1691.42]  and then I'll go ahead
[1691.42 --> 1692.48]  and oh wow
[1692.48 --> 1693.08]  there was no ad.
[1694.50 --> 1695.22]  Worst intro
[1695.22 --> 1696.32]  we have ever done.
[1697.40 --> 1698.54]  Many episodes ago.
[1699.10 --> 1699.30]  Yeah,
[1699.42 --> 1700.12]  so this is where
[1700.12 --> 1700.46]  the,
[1700.88 --> 1701.40]  here basically
[1701.40 --> 1703.54]  I'll give you guys
[1703.54 --> 1704.66]  a sneak peek
[1704.66 --> 1705.98]  at just exactly
[1705.98 --> 1706.92]  what is going down.
[1707.24 --> 1707.92]  That is me.
[1708.26 --> 1709.02]  That is me
[1709.02 --> 1709.82]  in my old
[1709.82 --> 1710.72]  Student Works
[1710.72 --> 1711.56]  painting shirt
[1711.56 --> 1712.64]  from my house
[1712.64 --> 1713.50]  painting days.
[1714.12 --> 1715.08]  So yes,
[1715.12 --> 1715.76]  you will witness
[1715.76 --> 1716.30]  that
[1716.30 --> 1717.46]  and many other
[1717.46 --> 1717.94]  things
[1717.94 --> 1719.04]  in the Channel Super Fun
[1719.04 --> 1720.08]  car painting episode.
[1720.40 --> 1721.44]  So that is,
[1721.50 --> 1722.28]  that is some good stuff
[1722.28 --> 1722.68]  right there.
[1723.08 --> 1724.18]  Let's move on.
[1724.30 --> 1724.92]  Intel,
[1725.08 --> 1725.66]  this was posted
[1725.66 --> 1726.78]  by Jesper
[1726.78 --> 1730.18]  101996
[1730.18 --> 1731.82]  and Intel says
[1731.82 --> 1732.58]  the shortages
[1732.58 --> 1733.62]  of Broadwell
[1733.62 --> 1735.54]  and Skylake CPUs
[1735.54 --> 1736.94]  will be going away.
[1737.06 --> 1738.40]  So if you've been
[1738.40 --> 1739.30]  wondering about,
[1739.48 --> 1739.82]  you know,
[1740.36 --> 1741.22]  where exactly
[1741.22 --> 1742.22]  you can get,
[1742.38 --> 1742.70]  you know,
[1742.84 --> 1745.96]  a 5775C
[1745.96 --> 1746.60]  for example,
[1746.68 --> 1747.62]  that's the Broadwell chip
[1747.62 --> 1749.08]  or a 6700K,
[1749.20 --> 1750.18]  that's the Skylake
[1750.18 --> 1751.26]  Core i7,
[1751.76 --> 1753.14]  then supply
[1753.14 --> 1754.02]  is expected
[1754.02 --> 1754.98]  to improve
[1754.98 --> 1755.88]  soon
[1755.88 --> 1756.64]  and we should see
[1756.64 --> 1757.94]  more of everything
[1757.94 --> 1759.52]  as Q3 progresses.
[1760.12 --> 1761.34]  So Q3 is
[1761.34 --> 1761.92]  August,
[1762.24 --> 1762.60]  September,
[1762.80 --> 1763.20]  October.
[1763.60 --> 1763.76]  No,
[1764.50 --> 1765.04]  July,
[1765.54 --> 1765.82]  August,
[1766.08 --> 1766.46]  September.
[1767.38 --> 1767.84]  Yes,
[1768.20 --> 1769.02]  that is Q3.
[1769.18 --> 1769.80]  So throughout
[1769.80 --> 1770.82]  the rest of
[1770.82 --> 1772.52]  whatever is going
[1772.52 --> 1772.98]  on right now.
[1773.28 --> 1773.56]  All right,
[1773.64 --> 1774.50]  this is a pretty good,
[1774.60 --> 1774.72]  oh,
[1774.78 --> 1775.42]  this was originally
[1775.42 --> 1776.10]  posted on
[1776.10 --> 1777.12]  techreport.com.
[1777.20 --> 1777.62]  I'll go ahead
[1777.62 --> 1779.14]  and pull that puppy
[1779.14 --> 1779.56]  up there.
[1780.34 --> 1781.04]  And I don't know
[1781.04 --> 1781.86]  if I ever actually
[1781.86 --> 1782.42]  posted this
[1782.42 --> 1783.08]  in the Twitch chat.
[1783.34 --> 1784.16]  This is why
[1784.16 --> 1784.96]  this show is hard
[1784.96 --> 1786.26]  to run by myself.
[1786.90 --> 1787.38]  This is why
[1787.38 --> 1787.78]  I have trouble
[1787.78 --> 1788.52]  with what
[1788.52 --> 1789.28]  the devil
[1789.28 --> 1790.36]  is going on here.
[1790.50 --> 1792.14]  So this is
[1792.14 --> 1793.14]  apparently like
[1793.14 --> 1795.02]  a happy new
[1795.02 --> 1795.74]  office gift.
[1797.04 --> 1798.04]  Five pizzas.
[1798.26 --> 1799.12]  They know how many,
[1799.32 --> 1800.00]  they know enough
[1800.00 --> 1801.34]  to know where we are,
[1801.42 --> 1802.06]  but they don't know
[1802.06 --> 1802.52]  enough to know
[1802.52 --> 1803.10]  how many people
[1803.10 --> 1803.52]  work here.
[1803.74 --> 1804.64]  there's pizzas
[1804.64 --> 1806.16]  specifically for
[1806.16 --> 1806.86]  specific people.
[1807.40 --> 1808.12]  So this is for
[1808.12 --> 1808.92]  Nick and Justin.
[1809.66 --> 1810.12]  Okay.
[1810.66 --> 1810.94]  Yeah.
[1811.04 --> 1812.50]  So there you go.
[1812.54 --> 1812.70]  Here,
[1812.80 --> 1813.60]  come take this.
[1814.50 --> 1815.28]  We're apparently
[1815.28 --> 1816.74]  doing pizza distribution.
[1816.74 --> 1818.36]  I'll read off
[1818.36 --> 1818.78]  what it is.
[1818.82 --> 1819.36]  So this is
[1819.36 --> 1820.70]  pizza five
[1820.70 --> 1821.58]  for Nick and Justin.
[1821.58 --> 1821.74]  Yeah,
[1821.78 --> 1822.58]  you guys are five.
[1822.68 --> 1823.18]  Get wrecked,
[1823.24 --> 1823.38]  bro.
[1823.60 --> 1824.30]  It's from
[1824.30 --> 1824.82]  Ixy,
[1825.12 --> 1825.64]  Hazy Nips,
[1825.68 --> 1826.04]  and Mate.
[1826.60 --> 1827.74]  It is
[1827.74 --> 1829.24]  basically has
[1829.24 --> 1829.72]  pepperoni,
[1829.82 --> 1830.04]  bacon,
[1830.14 --> 1830.46]  jalapenos,
[1830.62 --> 1830.98]  and goat chicken.
[1830.98 --> 1831.34]  Oh,
[1831.40 --> 1832.06]  yes.
[1832.58 --> 1833.02]  Sweet.
[1833.26 --> 1834.24]  This one is
[1834.24 --> 1835.36]  from the same people.
[1835.54 --> 1836.10]  Not surprising.
[1836.18 --> 1836.68]  This one is for
[1836.68 --> 1837.38]  Taryn and John.
[1837.84 --> 1839.48]  They got wrecked.
[1839.48 --> 1840.02]  What'd they get?
[1840.02 --> 1840.46]  I knew someone
[1840.46 --> 1841.42]  was going to get pranked,
[1841.50 --> 1842.60]  and it was Taryn and John.
[1842.78 --> 1843.14]  Okay,
[1843.26 --> 1844.48]  so the cheese is mozzarella,
[1844.74 --> 1845.72]  and the toppings are
[1845.72 --> 1846.68]  pineapple,
[1847.02 --> 1847.76]  anchovies,
[1847.96 --> 1848.32]  oysters,
[1848.60 --> 1849.96]  and sour cream.
[1850.52 --> 1851.12]  So that's why
[1851.12 --> 1852.16]  they ordered five pizzas,
[1852.16 --> 1853.18]  so that some of them
[1853.18 --> 1854.16]  could be horrible.
[1854.16 --> 1856.90]  So this one is ours.
[1857.54 --> 1858.82]  You can read that one off.
[1858.92 --> 1859.26]  Okay,
[1859.46 --> 1860.40]  what do we got here?
[1861.16 --> 1861.60]  Pepperoni,
[1861.68 --> 1862.30]  green peppers,
[1862.50 --> 1862.96]  jalapenos,
[1863.16 --> 1863.50]  bacon,
[1863.62 --> 1864.50]  and grilled chicken
[1864.50 --> 1865.40]  with mozzarella
[1865.40 --> 1867.90]  and cheddar cheese.
[1868.38 --> 1870.08]  That is a wicked-sounding pizza.
[1870.22 --> 1871.12]  The boss is straight up
[1871.12 --> 1871.96]  not sharing that one.
[1872.04 --> 1872.54]  I'm sorry to hear
[1872.54 --> 1873.16]  that you didn't get
[1873.16 --> 1873.78]  a pizza loop.
[1874.00 --> 1874.42]  Oh, no.
[1874.88 --> 1875.28]  Okay,
[1875.62 --> 1876.54]  that sucked.
[1877.02 --> 1877.76]  That's for,
[1877.90 --> 1878.78]  that one's pretty rocking.
[1879.10 --> 1879.50]  Okay,
[1879.70 --> 1880.20]  so we got,
[1880.26 --> 1881.56]  this is for Dennis and Burkle.
[1881.74 --> 1882.20]  Green peppers,
[1882.32 --> 1882.80]  red peppers,
[1882.94 --> 1883.34]  jalapenos,
[1883.34 --> 1884.28]  hot banana pepper,
[1884.42 --> 1885.18]  spicy pepperoni,
[1885.24 --> 1886.22]  and spicy Italian sausage.
[1886.64 --> 1887.44]  Burkle went home early,
[1887.52 --> 1888.08]  so I guess Dennis
[1888.08 --> 1889.06]  is going to have to eat this one
[1889.06 --> 1890.10]  all by his lonesome.
[1890.80 --> 1892.00]  And the last one.
[1892.82 --> 1894.66]  This is for Brandon and Ed,
[1894.94 --> 1896.46]  and this is pretty plain Jane.
[1896.76 --> 1897.62]  Mozzarella cheese,
[1897.76 --> 1898.26]  pepperoni,
[1898.44 --> 1898.72]  bacon,
[1898.90 --> 1899.72]  and jalapeno.
[1899.84 --> 1900.12]  So guys,
[1900.20 --> 1900.64]  get in here
[1900.64 --> 1902.64]  and claim your pizzas.
[1903.58 --> 1903.90]  Oh,
[1904.16 --> 1904.98]  I'll send this.
[1905.98 --> 1906.74]  So he's going to get
[1906.74 --> 1907.34]  wrapped on it.
[1907.34 --> 1907.66]  Yay!
[1909.02 --> 1909.46]  Yeah,
[1909.52 --> 1910.56]  poor John and Taryn.
[1910.74 --> 1911.14]  Why are you guys
[1911.14 --> 1912.00]  going to distribute those?
[1912.00 --> 1912.72]  Why are you guys so mean?
[1912.84 --> 1913.22]  All right,
[1913.22 --> 1914.92]  so here's a pretty great topic.
[1915.00 --> 1915.76]  This was posted by
[1915.76 --> 1918.70]  Jesper101996 on the forum.
[1918.80 --> 1919.96]  The original article here
[1919.96 --> 1921.76]  is from Ars Technica.
[1922.22 --> 1923.06]  I'm going to go ahead
[1923.06 --> 1923.96]  and pull it up.
[1924.12 --> 1924.22]  Yeah,
[1924.32 --> 1925.90]  get out of here.
[1926.16 --> 1926.68]  Go ahead.
[1926.68 --> 1927.40]  What's that?
[1927.52 --> 1928.78]  The door not closes itself
[1928.78 --> 1929.36]  automatically.
[1929.62 --> 1930.86]  You want fiber internet?
[1931.26 --> 1931.78]  That'll be
[1931.78 --> 1933.50]  $383,500.
[1933.50 --> 1934.10]  Oh, jeez.
[1934.10 --> 1935.34]  $500.
[1935.34 --> 1935.64]  $383,500.
[1937.64 --> 1938.08]  Um,
[1938.32 --> 1940.84]  what?
[1940.84 --> 1941.40]  I love how,
[1941.40 --> 1942.58]  I love how ISPs
[1942.58 --> 1943.76]  seem to have this thing
[1943.76 --> 1944.46]  where it's like,
[1944.80 --> 1945.08]  oh,
[1945.34 --> 1946.16]  you want us like,
[1946.30 --> 1947.02]  like companies,
[1947.14 --> 1947.96]  like McDonald's.
[1948.04 --> 1948.98]  If you want a McDonald's
[1948.98 --> 1949.56]  in your town,
[1949.76 --> 1950.76]  you can probably email them
[1950.76 --> 1951.22]  or something
[1951.22 --> 1952.54]  and they'll probably come
[1952.54 --> 1953.14]  build a store
[1953.14 --> 1953.86]  if you have enough people
[1953.86 --> 1955.08]  that would take the service.
[1955.08 --> 1955.54]  and they do,
[1955.76 --> 1956.00]  you know,
[1956.06 --> 1959.18]  like a business case analysis
[1959.18 --> 1960.46]  and...
[1960.46 --> 1962.70]  Can I say thanks to Nips,
[1962.84 --> 1963.14]  Mave,
[1963.20 --> 1963.84]  and Ixing?
[1963.94 --> 1964.08]  No,
[1964.16 --> 1964.56]  you can't.
[1964.56 --> 1965.28]  I covered the mic.
[1965.88 --> 1966.22]  Damn.
[1966.34 --> 1966.86]  That was Ed.
[1966.92 --> 1967.58]  He says thanks.
[1968.64 --> 1969.04]  Um,
[1969.44 --> 1969.90]  so yeah,
[1970.08 --> 1970.84]  they'll do like,
[1970.92 --> 1971.26]  you know,
[1971.26 --> 1971.70]  like a,
[1971.70 --> 1972.88]  like a business case
[1972.88 --> 1973.58]  and proposal
[1973.58 --> 1975.00]  and if they can find
[1975.00 --> 1976.12]  a franchise owner,
[1976.38 --> 1976.64]  right,
[1976.76 --> 1977.28]  they might have
[1977.28 --> 1978.50]  different business models
[1978.50 --> 1979.12]  for,
[1979.36 --> 1979.56]  you know,
[1979.64 --> 1979.94]  all well-
[1979.94 --> 1981.44]  Depending what business it is.
[1981.44 --> 1982.36]  It's basically getting
[1982.36 --> 1983.48]  a co-investor
[1983.48 --> 1984.46]  effectively,
[1984.70 --> 1984.92]  right?
[1985.24 --> 1985.34]  Yeah.
[1985.54 --> 1985.96]  Um,
[1986.88 --> 1987.42]  no,
[1987.54 --> 1988.34]  and I love,
[1988.44 --> 1989.44]  I love Ars Technica.
[1989.50 --> 1990.74]  These guys do such a great job
[1990.74 --> 1992.14]  of ripping ISPs a new one.
[1992.30 --> 1992.48]  Yeah.
[1992.74 --> 1993.18]  So,
[1993.58 --> 1995.90]  the basic summary is this.
[1996.08 --> 1998.12]  The farmer says,
[1998.36 --> 1998.66]  okay,
[1998.84 --> 2000.02]  I would like to get
[2000.02 --> 2000.50]  your,
[2000.50 --> 2001.62]  your fiber network
[2001.62 --> 2002.84]  extended to my farm
[2002.84 --> 2003.40]  in,
[2003.40 --> 2004.00]  uh,
[2004.00 --> 2004.36]  Cerisco,
[2004.52 --> 2004.98]  Nebraska,
[2004.98 --> 2005.86]  uh,
[2005.86 --> 2006.48]  which is only
[2006.48 --> 2007.96]  four and a half miles away
[2007.96 --> 2009.02]  from Windstream,
[2009.16 --> 2010.18]  that's the name of the ISP,
[2010.46 --> 2011.32]  away from their
[2011.32 --> 2012.56]  nearest fiber facility.
[2012.74 --> 2013.18]  Actually,
[2013.34 --> 2014.50]  in the grand scheme of things,
[2014.50 --> 2016.52]  is not that bad.
[2016.52 --> 2017.26]  Really not that far.
[2017.54 --> 2018.90]  Really not that far.
[2018.96 --> 2019.20]  I mean,
[2019.38 --> 2020.50]  we were looking at,
[2021.00 --> 2021.10]  uh,
[2021.34 --> 2021.62]  you know,
[2021.66 --> 2023.54]  not a completely trivial distance
[2023.54 --> 2024.60]  down the road from us,
[2024.68 --> 2026.44]  and I think our build-out cost
[2026.44 --> 2028.18]  was five digits,
[2028.64 --> 2030.38]  not six.
[2030.38 --> 2031.52]  Even better,
[2031.52 --> 2031.54]  even better,
[2031.70 --> 2032.08]  actually,
[2032.24 --> 2032.96]  the farmer was able
[2032.96 --> 2033.80]  to determine that there
[2033.80 --> 2034.84]  appeared to be a Windstream
[2034.84 --> 2036.44]  fiber line about a quarter
[2036.44 --> 2037.66]  mile from his property,
[2037.86 --> 2039.38]  which is confirmed by a map
[2039.38 --> 2040.66]  of their fiber network.
[2040.94 --> 2041.96]  A quarter mile from his
[2041.96 --> 2044.62]  property is not bad.
[2044.84 --> 2045.24]  But,
[2045.50 --> 2045.90]  but,
[2046.02 --> 2046.42]  uh,
[2046.44 --> 2047.14]  apparently,
[2047.44 --> 2047.76]  uh,
[2047.76 --> 2048.76]  they refused to connect
[2048.76 --> 2049.50]  him to that line,
[2049.80 --> 2051.70]  citing some sort of,
[2051.78 --> 2052.04]  it's,
[2052.12 --> 2053.32]  stating that it's some sort
[2053.32 --> 2054.54]  of reserved private
[2054.54 --> 2055.98]  Windstream only line,
[2055.98 --> 2056.18]  which,
[2056.48 --> 2057.46]  if you guys know anything
[2057.46 --> 2058.60]  about the kind of data
[2058.60 --> 2060.14]  capacity of,
[2060.38 --> 2062.08]  that fiber is capable of,
[2062.40 --> 2062.96]  Very unlikely.
[2063.58 --> 2063.68]  Like,
[2063.68 --> 2063.98]  it,
[2063.98 --> 2064.26]  it,
[2064.26 --> 2066.16]  it is basically not a thing.
[2066.34 --> 2067.32]  You don't run fiber
[2067.32 --> 2069.62]  anywhere without dark fiber,
[2069.78 --> 2069.94]  like,
[2069.94 --> 2071.14]  without extra capacity.
[2071.42 --> 2071.60]  Yeah.
[2071.80 --> 2072.28]  And,
[2072.60 --> 2074.62]  even if you only had
[2074.62 --> 2076.56]  one piece
[2076.56 --> 2077.60]  of fiber,
[2077.96 --> 2079.32]  even if there was just one,
[2079.38 --> 2080.24]  which there isn't,
[2080.58 --> 2081.98]  even if there was just one,
[2082.36 --> 2084.06]  it's not like you can't split
[2084.06 --> 2085.64]  multiple signals across a single
[2085.64 --> 2086.26]  piece of fiber.
[2086.48 --> 2087.40]  That is a thing.
[2088.48 --> 2089.48]  It's just fine.
[2090.20 --> 2091.32]  There's no way they need
[2091.32 --> 2093.00]  the entire capacity of it
[2093.00 --> 2094.16]  just for themselves.
[2095.06 --> 2095.40]  Um,
[2095.50 --> 2096.68]  so after receiving this
[2096.68 --> 2097.88]  ridiculous quote,
[2098.14 --> 2099.40]  they contacted another
[2099.40 --> 2100.28]  network provider,
[2100.62 --> 2100.66]  uh,
[2100.76 --> 2102.34]  Northeast Telephone Company,
[2102.34 --> 2103.34]  and even though they're
[2103.34 --> 2104.54]  completely out of their
[2104.54 --> 2105.16]  service area,
[2105.34 --> 2106.34]  they quoted the farmer
[2106.34 --> 2107.70]  $41,900.
[2108.42 --> 2109.92]  So just over 10%
[2109.92 --> 2111.50]  the previous estimate
[2111.50 --> 2112.76]  to extend their fiber line
[2112.76 --> 2112.88]  to his property.
[2112.88 --> 2113.42]  They also offered
[2113.42 --> 2115.00]  a $6,000 credit
[2115.00 --> 2116.02]  for any other customer
[2116.02 --> 2116.68]  that signed up
[2116.68 --> 2117.38]  using the line
[2117.38 --> 2117.86]  that the farmer
[2117.86 --> 2118.72]  was paying to install.
[2118.78 --> 2118.98]  I mean,
[2119.00 --> 2119.58]  you know what the stupid
[2119.58 --> 2120.12]  thing is,
[2120.16 --> 2121.22]  is we got a quote
[2121.22 --> 2122.12]  from Telus
[2122.12 --> 2123.04]  for this place,
[2123.04 --> 2124.78]  and they came in,
[2124.86 --> 2125.86]  even though they're,
[2126.06 --> 2126.12]  like,
[2126.50 --> 2127.84]  the fiber infrastructure
[2127.84 --> 2129.66]  in British Columbia,
[2130.02 --> 2130.34]  like,
[2130.74 --> 2131.56]  it's Telus.
[2131.80 --> 2132.08]  Yeah.
[2132.42 --> 2132.94]  Um,
[2132.94 --> 2133.78]  or someone leasing
[2133.78 --> 2134.54]  from Telus.
[2135.92 --> 2137.20]  Telus came in
[2137.20 --> 2139.06]  several times
[2139.06 --> 2140.48]  more expensive
[2140.48 --> 2142.00]  in every possible way
[2142.00 --> 2143.28]  compared to any other
[2143.28 --> 2144.08]  quote we got.
[2144.08 --> 2144.68]  Like,
[2144.72 --> 2145.48]  they were completely
[2145.48 --> 2146.28]  out to lunch.
[2146.86 --> 2147.92]  And I was like,
[2148.18 --> 2149.20]  so is the service
[2149.20 --> 2149.64]  different?
[2149.94 --> 2150.50]  And they're like,
[2150.98 --> 2151.48]  well,
[2151.64 --> 2153.00]  we can offer services
[2153.00 --> 2154.50]  like a cell phone
[2154.50 --> 2155.12]  failover.
[2155.46 --> 2156.46]  And I'm like,
[2156.80 --> 2157.28]  right.
[2157.94 --> 2159.58]  But unless I'm buying,
[2159.68 --> 2160.00]  like,
[2160.44 --> 2162.32]  a thousands of dollars
[2162.32 --> 2163.02]  a month
[2163.02 --> 2164.62]  cell phone plan,
[2166.00 --> 2166.34]  like,
[2166.38 --> 2167.54]  couldn't I just buy that?
[2167.62 --> 2168.30]  Couldn't I just get,
[2168.42 --> 2168.50]  like,
[2168.54 --> 2170.04]  a 4G hotspot
[2170.04 --> 2170.76]  stupid thing
[2170.76 --> 2171.36]  and put it in my
[2171.36 --> 2172.00]  server room?
[2172.20 --> 2172.54]  Like,
[2172.58 --> 2173.58]  if that's my plan,
[2173.70 --> 2174.44]  if that's my backup
[2174.44 --> 2175.12]  internet plan,
[2175.26 --> 2176.24]  or if I wasn't a
[2176.24 --> 2177.14]  complete idiot,
[2177.50 --> 2178.22]  couldn't I just get,
[2178.32 --> 2178.40]  like,
[2178.40 --> 2179.44]  a residential line
[2179.44 --> 2180.64]  from you?
[2182.08 --> 2183.42]  Or Shahar or something
[2183.42 --> 2184.44]  and run that
[2184.44 --> 2185.52]  into the building as well?
[2185.54 --> 2185.78]  Yeah, even better,
[2185.88 --> 2186.66]  a different brand.
[2186.82 --> 2188.08]  It's like 80 bucks
[2188.08 --> 2188.58]  a month
[2188.58 --> 2189.96]  for, like,
[2190.00 --> 2190.64]  something that's good
[2190.64 --> 2191.40]  enough to keep
[2191.40 --> 2193.22]  the office operational
[2193.22 --> 2194.78]  in the extremely
[2194.78 --> 2195.70]  unlikely event
[2195.70 --> 2196.66]  that the fiber
[2196.66 --> 2197.66]  connection's unavailable.
[2197.80 --> 2197.98]  Like,
[2198.02 --> 2198.50]  come on.
[2198.66 --> 2198.86]  Yeah.
[2199.06 --> 2199.92]  You guys are ridiculous.
[2200.98 --> 2201.26]  So,
[2201.40 --> 2202.34]  it's unclear
[2202.34 --> 2203.52]  why Winstream's fee
[2203.52 --> 2204.48]  was so much higher,
[2204.60 --> 2205.58]  but they confirmed it
[2205.58 --> 2206.24]  when contacted
[2206.24 --> 2207.18]  by Ars Technica,
[2207.32 --> 2208.20]  stating that the total
[2208.20 --> 2209.74]  quote was for 36 months
[2209.74 --> 2210.72]  of dedicated
[2210.72 --> 2211.70]  internet service.
[2212.32 --> 2212.68]  And they,
[2212.90 --> 2213.48]  when pressed for
[2213.48 --> 2214.26]  further information
[2214.26 --> 2215.12]  as to how exactly
[2215.12 --> 2216.22]  they calculated that,
[2216.26 --> 2217.40]  did not respond
[2217.40 --> 2219.12]  about the private line
[2219.12 --> 2219.80]  a quarter mile
[2219.80 --> 2220.50]  from the property.
[2220.88 --> 2221.06]  Yeah.
[2221.06 --> 2222.34]  So,
[2223.02 --> 2223.26]  yeah.
[2223.38 --> 2223.50]  Oh,
[2223.52 --> 2223.88]  you know what?
[2223.92 --> 2224.64]  Why don't I do that?
[2224.78 --> 2225.68]  And why don't you run off
[2225.68 --> 2226.46]  and get some plates?
[2227.02 --> 2227.30]  Okay.
[2227.38 --> 2227.90]  Because I'm hungry.
[2228.02 --> 2228.46]  Are you hungry?
[2228.54 --> 2229.20]  I'm pretty hungry.
[2229.32 --> 2230.06]  Let's eat some food.
[2230.20 --> 2230.46]  So,
[2230.72 --> 2232.42]  it is sponsor time.
[2232.60 --> 2233.42]  Speaking of
[2233.42 --> 2234.44]  the internet,
[2234.96 --> 2236.34]  one of our sponsors today
[2236.34 --> 2237.44]  is actually
[2237.44 --> 2238.80]  a new one.
[2239.60 --> 2240.94]  TunnelBear.com.
[2241.00 --> 2241.46]  And you're going to want
[2241.46 --> 2241.96]  to go over to
[2241.96 --> 2242.80]  TunnelBear.com
[2242.80 --> 2243.86]  slash LTT
[2243.86 --> 2245.14]  if you want to
[2245.14 --> 2246.62]  start browsing privately.
[2247.28 --> 2247.48]  And,
[2248.12 --> 2248.56]  to be,
[2248.64 --> 2249.42]  I was about to say,
[2249.48 --> 2250.10]  this is going to tie
[2250.10 --> 2250.62]  really well
[2250.62 --> 2251.66]  into one of our topics
[2251.66 --> 2252.60]  later on in the show.
[2253.06 --> 2253.60]  The whole,
[2253.68 --> 2254.44]  you know,
[2254.50 --> 2255.56]  Windows 10
[2255.56 --> 2256.52]  and,
[2256.64 --> 2257.40]  you know,
[2257.44 --> 2258.34]  not a whole lot of privacy
[2258.34 --> 2259.24]  with Windows 10 thing.
[2259.28 --> 2259.72]  But actually,
[2259.84 --> 2261.02]  this wouldn't help you
[2261.02 --> 2262.40]  with anything
[2262.40 --> 2263.68]  that's directly installed
[2263.68 --> 2264.32]  on your computer
[2264.32 --> 2265.28]  that's sending your information
[2265.28 --> 2265.86]  to someone else.
[2265.86 --> 2266.16]  But,
[2266.50 --> 2267.82]  anyone trying to
[2267.82 --> 2269.58]  spy on what you're doing
[2269.58 --> 2270.22]  externally,
[2270.46 --> 2271.08]  this does throw
[2271.08 --> 2272.32]  another obstacle in the way.
[2272.68 --> 2272.84]  So,
[2272.90 --> 2273.72]  it's an easy to use
[2273.72 --> 2274.32]  privacy app
[2274.32 --> 2274.76]  for mobile
[2274.76 --> 2275.68]  and desktop.
[2275.94 --> 2276.54]  You can tunnel
[2276.54 --> 2278.72]  through 14 different countries
[2278.72 --> 2279.44]  allowing you to browse
[2279.44 --> 2279.86]  the internet
[2279.86 --> 2281.34]  as though you're in that country.
[2281.46 --> 2281.90]  This is great
[2281.90 --> 2282.70]  for services
[2282.70 --> 2283.56]  that aren't available
[2283.56 --> 2284.22]  in your country.
[2284.34 --> 2284.84]  For example,
[2285.28 --> 2286.16]  it secures your internet
[2286.16 --> 2287.56]  when you're on public Wi-Fi.
[2287.94 --> 2288.78]  Great when traveling
[2288.78 --> 2289.62]  or at a conference
[2289.62 --> 2291.28]  or just at a restaurant
[2291.28 --> 2292.18]  or whatever else
[2292.18 --> 2292.96]  the case may be.
[2293.38 --> 2293.52]  And,
[2293.72 --> 2294.48]  once you turn TunnelBear on,
[2294.54 --> 2295.20]  your internet connection
[2295.20 --> 2296.18]  is fully encrypted.
[2296.32 --> 2297.28]  You don't have to be technical
[2297.28 --> 2298.52]  to use or install TunnelBear.
[2298.84 --> 2299.04]  And,
[2299.10 --> 2300.72]  they have friendly support bears
[2300.72 --> 2301.62]  that are standing by
[2301.62 --> 2303.38]  24 hours a day.
[2304.02 --> 2305.48]  They have 5 million users
[2305.48 --> 2306.74]  and you can try it out
[2306.74 --> 2307.66]  for free.
[2307.80 --> 2309.80]  You can get 500 megabytes
[2309.80 --> 2310.72]  of data for free
[2310.72 --> 2311.74]  every month
[2311.74 --> 2312.68]  and an extra gig
[2312.68 --> 2314.44]  if you tweet at them.
[2314.66 --> 2315.40]  If you need more data,
[2315.50 --> 2316.84]  prices for unlimited plans
[2316.84 --> 2318.64]  start at $6.99 a month.
[2318.70 --> 2319.22]  Very reasonable.
[2319.86 --> 2320.64]  Download it today
[2320.64 --> 2321.94]  to browse the internet privately.
[2322.08 --> 2322.92]  TunnelBear.com
[2322.92 --> 2324.26]  slash LTT.
[2324.78 --> 2325.06]  And,
[2325.14 --> 2326.38]  we'd love to hear from you guys
[2326.38 --> 2327.20]  if you have experience
[2327.20 --> 2327.80]  with TunnelBear
[2327.80 --> 2328.94]  because they are a new sponsor
[2328.94 --> 2329.42]  for us.
[2329.54 --> 2329.76]  So,
[2329.84 --> 2331.22]  always great to hear
[2331.22 --> 2331.76]  from you guys
[2331.76 --> 2332.60]  if you think we've,
[2332.60 --> 2332.80]  you know,
[2332.86 --> 2333.78]  picked a good thing
[2333.78 --> 2334.48]  to talk about.
[2334.86 --> 2335.16]  Although,
[2335.32 --> 2336.04]  our next sponsor
[2336.04 --> 2337.20]  is one that we don't
[2337.20 --> 2339.00]  really have any ambiguity about
[2339.00 --> 2339.64]  because we know
[2339.64 --> 2341.32]  Squarespace totally kicks butt.
[2342.66 --> 2344.08]  Build it beautiful, Linus.
[2345.26 --> 2346.50]  Why do you hate me?
[2346.86 --> 2347.58]  Build it beautiful.
[2347.78 --> 2348.14]  So,
[2348.96 --> 2350.54]  if I have to explain Squarespace,
[2350.80 --> 2351.70]  you could be a new viewer,
[2351.86 --> 2352.64]  but based on that,
[2352.68 --> 2353.56]  we are only halfway
[2353.56 --> 2354.40]  through the show
[2354.40 --> 2355.38]  and we have
[2355.38 --> 2358.98]  9,900 viewers right now.
[2359.12 --> 2359.62]  It must be
[2359.62 --> 2360.44]  the orange background
[2360.44 --> 2361.50]  because,
[2361.50 --> 2362.58]  because,
[2362.58 --> 2363.84]  Newark does look a lot better.
[2363.98 --> 2365.54]  It looks way more professional.
[2365.62 --> 2366.84]  Even with Harry Potter
[2366.84 --> 2368.50]  co-hosting the show with me
[2368.50 --> 2369.24]  last week,
[2369.68 --> 2371.70]  I got over 10,000 viewers.
[2371.86 --> 2372.38]  And I was like,
[2372.96 --> 2373.16]  what?
[2373.56 --> 2375.46]  I don't even have a co-host.
[2375.76 --> 2376.66]  I thought that was
[2376.66 --> 2377.86]  the whole point of the show.
[2379.36 --> 2379.84]  So,
[2380.06 --> 2380.46]  Squarespace,
[2380.94 --> 2382.08]  you are probably new
[2382.08 --> 2382.62]  if you don't know
[2382.62 --> 2383.14]  what they are,
[2383.24 --> 2384.52]  but it's the easy,
[2384.76 --> 2385.92]  professional looking
[2385.92 --> 2387.48]  and high performance
[2387.48 --> 2388.58]  way to build your own
[2388.58 --> 2389.96]  freaking awesome website.
[2390.10 --> 2390.88]  It'll work on mobile
[2390.88 --> 2391.42]  or desktop.
[2392.44 --> 2393.28]  They've got lots
[2393.28 --> 2394.02]  of great templates.
[2394.56 --> 2395.60]  No coding skill
[2395.60 --> 2396.24]  is required
[2396.24 --> 2397.10]  and they have
[2397.10 --> 2398.34]  24-7 tech support
[2398.34 --> 2399.30]  via live chat.
[2399.72 --> 2401.08]  It starts at $8 a month
[2401.08 --> 2402.06]  and if you get
[2402.06 --> 2403.16]  the first 12 months
[2403.16 --> 2403.86]  outright,
[2404.12 --> 2404.98]  then you actually get
[2404.98 --> 2405.94]  a domain name
[2405.94 --> 2407.00]  for free.
[2407.16 --> 2408.60]  Not a premium domain name.
[2408.74 --> 2409.46]  You can't just be like,
[2409.52 --> 2409.80]  well, yeah,
[2409.86 --> 2410.26]  I want to buy
[2410.26 --> 2411.24]  alphabet.com
[2411.24 --> 2411.78]  from BMW.
[2412.14 --> 2412.24]  So,
[2412.32 --> 2412.70]  Squarespace,
[2412.94 --> 2413.76]  if I pay you guys
[2413.76 --> 2414.80]  like $100
[2414.80 --> 2415.86]  for your service
[2415.86 --> 2416.34]  for a year,
[2416.42 --> 2417.24]  can you bid on that?
[2417.30 --> 2417.46]  No.
[2417.72 --> 2418.00]  No, no.
[2418.02 --> 2418.48]  It would have to be
[2418.48 --> 2419.60]  an available domain name.
[2419.60 --> 2420.98]  And, yeah,
[2421.06 --> 2421.68]  pretty much trusted
[2421.68 --> 2422.56]  by millions of people
[2422.56 --> 2423.24]  and some of the most
[2423.24 --> 2424.28]  respected brands
[2424.28 --> 2424.74]  in the world
[2424.74 --> 2426.94]  including Linus Media Group.
[2427.14 --> 2427.94]  And he said
[2427.94 --> 2428.96]  you don't need
[2428.96 --> 2429.76]  to know coding,
[2430.02 --> 2430.68]  but if you want
[2430.68 --> 2431.38]  to do some HTML
[2431.38 --> 2432.14]  injection stuff
[2432.14 --> 2432.86]  into their templates,
[2433.06 --> 2434.18]  that is an option.
[2434.82 --> 2436.18]  So you can tweak things
[2436.18 --> 2436.56]  definitely,
[2436.70 --> 2437.04]  for sure.
[2437.04 --> 2438.26]  So,
[2438.26 --> 2439.36]  Squarespace.com,
[2440.02 --> 2440.26]  oh,
[2440.42 --> 2441.14]  I got a jalapeno.
[2441.32 --> 2442.12]  Can you do the offer code?
[2443.04 --> 2444.06]  I think it's
[2444.06 --> 2444.76]  I need water.
[2445.96 --> 2446.96]  Squarespace.com,
[2447.04 --> 2448.20]  offer code Linus
[2448.20 --> 2449.96]  to get 10% off
[2449.96 --> 2451.18]  your first purchase.
[2454.18 --> 2454.66]  Squarespace,
[2454.98 --> 2455.64]  build it beautiful.
[2456.08 --> 2456.54]  So, yes,
[2456.98 --> 2458.16]  Squarespace.com,
[2458.26 --> 2459.08]  offer code Linus,
[2459.16 --> 2459.58]  10% off
[2459.58 --> 2460.30]  your first purchase.
[2460.76 --> 2461.02]  Done,
[2461.28 --> 2461.62]  done,
[2461.94 --> 2462.42]  done.
[2462.88 --> 2463.34]  That's it
[2463.34 --> 2464.02]  for Squarespace.
[2464.02 --> 2464.26]  Anyways,
[2464.56 --> 2465.00]  thank you,
[2465.04 --> 2465.42]  Squarespace,
[2465.98 --> 2466.60]  for continuing
[2466.60 --> 2467.10]  to sponsor
[2467.10 --> 2467.74]  the WAN show
[2467.74 --> 2469.42]  because that was
[2469.42 --> 2469.80]  hilarious,
[2470.14 --> 2470.62]  and I'm happy
[2470.62 --> 2471.48]  that that just happened.
[2471.88 --> 2472.02]  Now,
[2472.06 --> 2472.62]  if I can actually
[2472.62 --> 2473.34]  get my laptop
[2473.34 --> 2474.08]  to work and open
[2474.08 --> 2474.52]  up the dock,
[2474.58 --> 2475.08]  we'll talk about
[2475.08 --> 2475.60]  a new thing.
[2475.86 --> 2476.54]  The only problem
[2476.54 --> 2477.06]  with me talking
[2477.06 --> 2477.68]  about a new thing
[2477.68 --> 2478.36]  is that I was
[2478.36 --> 2479.00]  3D printing
[2479.00 --> 2479.70]  all freaking day
[2479.70 --> 2480.44]  with the Twitch chat
[2480.44 --> 2480.86]  over at
[2480.86 --> 2481.38]  twitch.tv
[2481.38 --> 2481.70]  slash
[2481.70 --> 2482.44]  luke underscore
[2482.44 --> 2482.74]  lFR,
[2483.20 --> 2483.72]  which was,
[2483.84 --> 2483.94]  I think,
[2483.98 --> 2484.52]  the longest stream
[2484.52 --> 2485.12]  we've ever done.
[2486.98 --> 2487.56]  Have you talked
[2487.56 --> 2488.18]  about Intel
[2488.18 --> 2488.78]  Skylake
[2488.78 --> 2489.14]  Broadwell
[2489.14 --> 2489.88]  CPU shortages?
[2491.62 --> 2492.06]  Yep.
[2492.06 --> 2492.10]  Yes,
[2492.10 --> 2493.58]  I did do that.
[2493.70 --> 2493.82]  Okay.
[2494.02 --> 2496.92]  Spotify ending
[2496.92 --> 2497.88]  free music.
[2498.04 --> 2498.34]  Dun,
[2498.48 --> 2498.86]  dun,
[2499.08 --> 2499.34]  dun.
[2499.56 --> 2499.96]  Oh,
[2499.98 --> 2500.64]  jeez.
[2500.78 --> 2501.42]  Due to pressure
[2501.42 --> 2502.34]  from like a bunch
[2502.34 --> 2502.80]  of companies?
[2502.94 --> 2503.68]  That doesn't seem
[2503.68 --> 2504.28]  like them.
[2504.44 --> 2505.54]  Original article here
[2505.54 --> 2505.94]  is from
[2505.94 --> 2507.00]  somuchhate.com,
[2507.04 --> 2507.52]  but basically
[2507.52 --> 2508.36]  they have no choice.
[2508.48 --> 2508.90]  I thought it would
[2508.90 --> 2509.78]  shake my head.
[2510.32 --> 2510.50]  Oh,
[2510.52 --> 2510.94]  is it that?
[2511.20 --> 2512.02]  I don't know.
[2512.10 --> 2512.94]  I actually don't know.
[2513.36 --> 2513.84]  Okay.
[2514.12 --> 2515.46]  The Sydney Morning Herald.
[2515.86 --> 2516.80]  I was just kind of
[2516.80 --> 2517.48]  having fun with it.
[2517.48 --> 2518.36]  So much hate.
[2518.36 --> 2520.60]  We're both
[2520.60 --> 2521.72]  completely wrong.
[2523.00 --> 2523.26]  Oh,
[2523.32 --> 2523.56]  God.
[2523.68 --> 2523.84]  Oh,
[2523.90 --> 2524.16]  also,
[2524.24 --> 2524.80]  I want to say,
[2524.92 --> 2526.06]  Taryn did eat
[2526.06 --> 2526.94]  one slice of that
[2526.94 --> 2527.26]  pizza.
[2528.42 --> 2528.78]  Did he?
[2529.00 --> 2529.24]  Yeah.
[2529.66 --> 2530.46]  John apparently
[2530.46 --> 2531.00]  likes it.
[2531.22 --> 2531.74]  What?
[2532.00 --> 2532.38]  Yeah,
[2532.54 --> 2533.54]  the anchovy
[2533.54 --> 2534.70]  oyster pizza.
[2536.70 --> 2537.22]  God,
[2537.30 --> 2538.30]  that's so weird.
[2538.50 --> 2538.80]  Anyway,
[2538.80 --> 2539.22]  sorry.
[2539.78 --> 2540.38]  Shortage is
[2540.38 --> 2540.98]  ending soon.
[2540.98 --> 2542.90]  So,
[2543.10 --> 2543.74]  yeah,
[2543.86 --> 2544.16]  basically,
[2544.48 --> 2544.94]  they're getting
[2544.94 --> 2545.82]  pressured by
[2545.82 --> 2548.30]  Universal,
[2548.66 --> 2548.86]  Warner,
[2549.00 --> 2549.46]  and Sony
[2549.46 --> 2550.48]  who are
[2550.48 --> 2551.24]  basically
[2551.24 --> 2553.02]  yet to renew
[2553.02 --> 2553.66]  their licenses
[2553.66 --> 2554.32]  to Spotify
[2554.32 --> 2555.16]  to host music
[2555.16 --> 2555.70]  for their artists.
[2555.82 --> 2556.38]  So this is like
[2556.38 --> 2557.56]  serious business.
[2557.76 --> 2558.74]  Spotify can either
[2558.74 --> 2559.78]  go premium only
[2559.78 --> 2561.12]  and compete
[2561.12 --> 2561.68]  head-to-head
[2561.68 --> 2562.56]  with all the other
[2562.56 --> 2563.62]  services that are,
[2564.28 --> 2564.56]  I mean,
[2564.72 --> 2565.80]  this has got to be
[2565.80 --> 2566.42]  a collusion
[2566.42 --> 2567.60]  lawsuit waiting to
[2567.60 --> 2567.90]  happen.
[2569.28 --> 2569.58]  Like,
[2569.70 --> 2570.50]  just stifling
[2570.50 --> 2570.96]  competition,
[2571.12 --> 2571.54]  but the problem
[2571.54 --> 2572.00]  is that it'll
[2572.00 --> 2573.14]  take 10 or 20
[2573.14 --> 2574.36]  years to actually
[2574.36 --> 2574.92]  resolve it,
[2574.96 --> 2575.82]  and by that time,
[2576.18 --> 2576.54]  you know,
[2577.00 --> 2577.90]  streaming might even
[2577.90 --> 2578.36]  be irrelevant.
[2578.48 --> 2579.24]  Maybe there's a dot
[2579.24 --> 2579.68]  that you,
[2579.82 --> 2580.00]  like,
[2580.22 --> 2581.02]  stick up your nose
[2581.02 --> 2581.92]  that contains all
[2581.92 --> 2582.52]  the music ever
[2582.52 --> 2582.82]  made,
[2582.94 --> 2584.82]  and you just run
[2584.82 --> 2585.58]  a wire from your
[2585.58 --> 2586.32]  nose to your ear.
[2588.46 --> 2589.12]  Is it called
[2589.12 --> 2589.88]  a babble fish?
[2590.70 --> 2590.96]  A babble.
[2590.96 --> 2591.48]  In Hitchhiker's Guide
[2591.48 --> 2591.98]  to the Galaxy?
[2592.08 --> 2593.16]  I actually have never
[2593.16 --> 2594.08]  seen or read
[2594.08 --> 2594.82]  Hitchhiker's Guide
[2594.82 --> 2595.38]  to the Galaxy.
[2596.90 --> 2597.72]  That makes me sad.
[2597.80 --> 2598.02]  Anyways,
[2598.08 --> 2598.36]  you put,
[2598.42 --> 2598.48]  like,
[2598.50 --> 2599.26]  a little fish in your
[2599.26 --> 2599.96]  ear because
[2599.96 --> 2600.58]  Hitchhiker's Guide
[2600.58 --> 2600.98]  to Galaxy,
[2601.32 --> 2601.92]  and it translates
[2601.92 --> 2602.60]  everything that you
[2602.60 --> 2602.78]  hear.
[2603.92 --> 2604.18]  Yeah,
[2604.20 --> 2604.70]  that makes sense.
[2604.86 --> 2605.76]  Maybe not a fish,
[2606.22 --> 2607.08]  but if science
[2607.08 --> 2607.62]  could solve that
[2607.62 --> 2608.06]  problem for me,
[2608.10 --> 2608.54]  that would be great.
[2608.66 --> 2608.78]  Yeah,
[2608.82 --> 2609.62]  like a magic booger.
[2609.96 --> 2610.26]  Sure.
[2611.02 --> 2611.46]  So,
[2611.88 --> 2612.86]  there you go.
[2613.50 --> 2613.80]  Sucky,
[2613.98 --> 2614.44]  there is no
[2614.44 --> 2614.98]  official statement
[2614.98 --> 2616.02]  from Spotify yet,
[2616.66 --> 2617.06]  but,
[2617.14 --> 2617.92]  yeah,
[2617.98 --> 2618.50]  there's really
[2618.50 --> 2619.44]  not too much
[2619.44 --> 2620.06]  else to say.
[2620.46 --> 2620.98]  This is,
[2621.06 --> 2621.14]  like,
[2621.18 --> 2621.62]  the super
[2621.62 --> 2622.52]  uninterestingest
[2622.52 --> 2623.12]  rumor ever
[2623.12 --> 2624.74]  because I think
[2624.74 --> 2625.74]  a lot of people
[2625.74 --> 2626.34]  were really
[2626.34 --> 2627.88]  confused.
[2628.06 --> 2628.58]  Due to the model
[2628.58 --> 2630.22]  names about
[2630.22 --> 2630.86]  what this meant,
[2630.98 --> 2631.88]  but a lot
[2631.88 --> 2632.50]  of the headlines
[2632.50 --> 2633.20]  that I looked
[2633.20 --> 2633.74]  at and a lot
[2633.74 --> 2634.54]  of forum discussion
[2634.54 --> 2636.36]  was that
[2636.36 --> 2639.74]  GTX 990M
[2639.74 --> 2640.48]  for notebooks
[2640.48 --> 2641.06]  may be based
[2641.06 --> 2641.76]  on the desktop
[2641.76 --> 2643.50]  GTX 980,
[2643.86 --> 2644.52]  which,
[2645.04 --> 2645.50]  to me,
[2645.68 --> 2646.64]  is the least
[2646.64 --> 2647.78]  interesting thing
[2647.78 --> 2648.22]  ever.
[2649.20 --> 2649.90]  NVIDIA does this
[2649.90 --> 2650.50]  every time.
[2650.52 --> 2651.28]  The confusing thing
[2651.28 --> 2652.88]  is that there's
[2652.88 --> 2653.80]  sticklers about
[2653.80 --> 2654.38]  model names
[2654.38 --> 2654.78]  when it comes
[2654.78 --> 2655.20]  to desktop
[2655.20 --> 2655.64]  and mobile,
[2655.84 --> 2656.18]  which is why
[2656.18 --> 2656.56]  they skipped
[2656.56 --> 2657.48]  the 300 series,
[2657.94 --> 2658.92]  but then
[2658.92 --> 2660.24]  they don't care
[2660.24 --> 2660.80]  about the rest
[2660.80 --> 2661.36]  of the numbers.
[2662.06 --> 2662.40]  Nope.
[2663.40 --> 2663.70]  What?
[2663.94 --> 2664.64]  And it's not
[2664.64 --> 2665.10]  the first time
[2665.10 --> 2665.66]  they've done this.
[2667.12 --> 2667.68]  990M
[2667.68 --> 2668.96]  being based
[2668.96 --> 2670.16]  on the 980
[2670.16 --> 2670.60]  desktop
[2670.60 --> 2672.72]  is not
[2672.72 --> 2673.16]  significant
[2673.16 --> 2673.74]  at all.
[2674.12 --> 2674.70]  980M
[2674.70 --> 2675.06]  is already
[2675.06 --> 2675.48]  based on
[2675.48 --> 2675.88]  the 980
[2675.88 --> 2676.24]  desktop.
[2677.06 --> 2677.90]  So we might
[2677.90 --> 2678.72]  get a little
[2678.72 --> 2679.42]  bit more power
[2679.42 --> 2679.92]  or something.
[2680.32 --> 2680.86]  The interesting
[2680.86 --> 2681.86]  stuff about
[2681.86 --> 2682.28]  this,
[2682.42 --> 2682.58]  though,
[2682.58 --> 2684.24]  is that
[2684.24 --> 2685.00]  NVIDIA is
[2685.00 --> 2685.86]  not launching
[2685.86 --> 2686.70]  an MXM
[2686.70 --> 2687.48]  module card
[2687.48 --> 2687.98]  this time.
[2688.18 --> 2688.56]  That's the
[2688.56 --> 2689.08]  current word
[2689.08 --> 2689.54]  on the street.
[2690.30 --> 2691.36]  And they're
[2691.36 --> 2692.08]  apparently going
[2692.08 --> 2692.60]  to be letting
[2692.60 --> 2694.28]  the laptop
[2694.28 --> 2695.02]  designers
[2695.02 --> 2697.28]  really build
[2697.28 --> 2697.98]  their cooling
[2697.98 --> 2698.94]  solution and
[2698.94 --> 2699.60]  their laptop
[2699.60 --> 2700.26]  and power
[2700.26 --> 2701.60]  delivery around
[2701.60 --> 2702.34]  how much of
[2702.34 --> 2702.70]  the chip
[2702.70 --> 2703.16]  they want to
[2703.16 --> 2703.66]  unlock.
[2704.44 --> 2704.46]  Interesting.
[2704.46 --> 2705.54]  So the way
[2705.54 --> 2706.02]  it's always
[2706.02 --> 2706.66]  worked in the
[2706.66 --> 2708.56]  past is that
[2708.56 --> 2709.16]  a laptop
[2709.16 --> 2710.22]  with a part
[2710.22 --> 2710.94]  X
[2710.94 --> 2712.02]  performs
[2712.02 --> 2713.22]  Y.
[2715.56 --> 2716.16]  990M
[2716.16 --> 2716.82]  notebooks could
[2716.82 --> 2717.62]  be all over
[2717.62 --> 2718.08]  the place.
[2718.88 --> 2719.76]  And I mean
[2719.76 --> 2720.18]  this has already
[2720.18 --> 2720.72]  been happening
[2720.72 --> 2721.50]  to a much
[2721.50 --> 2722.30]  lesser extent
[2722.30 --> 2723.04]  with GPU
[2723.04 --> 2723.60]  boost.
[2723.92 --> 2724.94]  With throttling
[2724.94 --> 2725.70]  and boosting
[2725.70 --> 2727.24]  but this could
[2727.24 --> 2728.36]  be a completely
[2728.36 --> 2729.04]  different level.
[2729.34 --> 2730.04]  Speaking of
[2730.04 --> 2730.72]  GPU boosting
[2730.72 --> 2731.42]  we actually
[2731.42 --> 2732.28]  have filmed
[2732.28 --> 2733.48]  the video
[2733.48 --> 2734.06]  where we took
[2734.06 --> 2735.44]  six Titan X's
[2735.44 --> 2736.52]  and compared
[2736.52 --> 2737.16]  their boost
[2737.16 --> 2738.22]  levels to find
[2738.22 --> 2738.76]  out how much
[2738.76 --> 2739.60]  performance variance
[2739.60 --> 2739.98]  there is.
[2740.08 --> 2740.52]  So stay tuned
[2740.52 --> 2741.06]  for that guys.
[2741.10 --> 2741.30]  It's filmed
[2741.30 --> 2741.80]  like back
[2741.80 --> 2742.34]  in the kitchen.
[2742.62 --> 2742.90]  Yeah.
[2743.60 --> 2744.08]  Like it's
[2744.08 --> 2745.36]  we kind of
[2745.36 --> 2746.62]  forgot about it.
[2746.84 --> 2747.06]  Apparently.
[2747.60 --> 2750.52]  So I don't
[2750.52 --> 2750.66]  know.
[2750.88 --> 2751.54]  I made it
[2751.54 --> 2751.94]  and then I was
[2751.94 --> 2752.48]  like oh I'm
[2752.48 --> 2753.00]  excited to see
[2753.00 --> 2753.52]  when that comes
[2753.52 --> 2753.90]  on YouTube
[2753.90 --> 2754.44]  so I can see
[2754.44 --> 2754.86]  the comments
[2754.86 --> 2755.24]  on it.
[2755.32 --> 2755.60]  And then I was
[2755.60 --> 2756.84]  like why is
[2756.84 --> 2758.16]  it taking so
[2758.16 --> 2758.52]  long?
[2759.56 --> 2759.96]  Yes.
[2760.10 --> 2760.60]  Apparently it was
[2760.60 --> 2760.78]  forgotten.
[2760.78 --> 2761.48]  Because literally
[2761.48 --> 2762.24]  no one has
[2762.24 --> 2762.86]  looked at it
[2762.86 --> 2763.82]  at all since
[2763.82 --> 2764.48]  you filmed it.
[2764.56 --> 2764.88]  Nope.
[2765.28 --> 2767.02]  So that's
[2767.02 --> 2767.36]  great.
[2768.24 --> 2768.84]  This is
[2768.84 --> 2771.28]  an original
[2771.28 --> 2772.14]  article from
[2772.14 --> 2772.72]  Engadget
[2772.72 --> 2773.44]  originally posted
[2773.44 --> 2774.06]  by Artie.
[2774.12 --> 2774.38]  By the way
[2774.38 --> 2774.86]  the last one
[2774.86 --> 2775.68]  was Ah Ming.
[2777.14 --> 2777.72]  The FBI
[2777.72 --> 2779.16]  says retweeting
[2779.16 --> 2779.72]  terrorist
[2779.72 --> 2780.52]  organizations
[2780.52 --> 2781.60]  could get you
[2781.60 --> 2782.90]  investigated
[2782.90 --> 2784.26]  and or
[2784.26 --> 2784.84]  even
[2784.84 --> 2785.70]  arrested.
[2786.00 --> 2786.46]  Basically you
[2786.46 --> 2786.74]  could get
[2786.74 --> 2787.10]  wrecked.
[2787.50 --> 2788.68]  So you
[2788.68 --> 2789.20]  probably
[2789.20 --> 2789.70]  shouldn't.
[2790.24 --> 2790.70]  I mean
[2790.70 --> 2791.72]  you shouldn't
[2791.72 --> 2792.54]  need the FBI
[2792.54 --> 2793.18]  to tell you
[2793.18 --> 2793.30]  this.
[2793.30 --> 2793.96]  honestly yeah.
[2794.50 --> 2794.92]  That's one
[2794.92 --> 2795.32]  thing that I
[2795.32 --> 2795.68]  thought about
[2795.68 --> 2796.04]  when I read
[2796.04 --> 2796.24]  this.
[2796.38 --> 2797.68]  Like I saw
[2797.68 --> 2798.40]  some comments
[2798.40 --> 2798.82]  I don't know
[2798.82 --> 2799.32]  what site
[2799.32 --> 2799.82]  it was on.
[2801.08 --> 2802.00]  People talking
[2802.00 --> 2802.52]  about this
[2802.52 --> 2804.24]  and oh I
[2804.24 --> 2804.94]  can't believe
[2804.94 --> 2805.44]  that they
[2805.44 --> 2806.06]  would think
[2806.06 --> 2806.42]  there's all
[2806.42 --> 2806.60]  this kind
[2806.60 --> 2806.82]  of stuff.
[2806.88 --> 2807.06]  I was like
[2807.06 --> 2807.32]  why?
[2807.46 --> 2807.70]  Why?
[2807.86 --> 2808.18]  Why are
[2808.18 --> 2808.44]  you doing
[2808.44 --> 2808.50]  this?
[2808.50 --> 2808.76]  What kind
[2808.76 --> 2809.14]  of tool
[2809.14 --> 2809.86]  shed is
[2809.86 --> 2810.50]  retweeting
[2810.50 --> 2811.16]  ISIS
[2811.16 --> 2811.84]  propaganda?
[2812.18 --> 2812.36]  Yeah.
[2813.88 --> 2814.32]  Period.
[2814.78 --> 2815.04]  Yeah.
[2816.00 --> 2816.46]  Like I
[2816.46 --> 2817.78]  don't blame
[2817.78 --> 2818.40]  them at all.
[2819.04 --> 2820.52]  I don't even
[2820.52 --> 2820.82]  know why
[2820.82 --> 2821.22]  they're telling
[2821.22 --> 2821.50]  us.
[2821.62 --> 2821.90]  They should
[2821.90 --> 2822.16]  have just
[2822.16 --> 2822.60]  probably been
[2822.60 --> 2822.90]  doing it.
[2822.90 --> 2823.22]  This isn't
[2823.22 --> 2823.56]  even the
[2823.56 --> 2824.24]  FBI being
[2824.24 --> 2824.82]  like yo
[2824.82 --> 2825.20]  we're gonna
[2825.20 --> 2826.02]  monitor your
[2826.02 --> 2828.02]  NSA chip
[2828.02 --> 2828.78]  inside your
[2828.78 --> 2829.36]  brain.
[2829.82 --> 2830.10]  No.
[2830.82 --> 2831.34]  You posted
[2831.34 --> 2831.96]  it on social
[2831.96 --> 2832.38]  media.
[2833.30 --> 2833.66]  That's a
[2833.66 --> 2835.10]  public thing.
[2835.12 --> 2835.92]  This is very
[2835.92 --> 2836.56]  very public.
[2836.66 --> 2837.96]  This is
[2837.96 --> 2838.66]  exactly the
[2838.66 --> 2839.08]  kind of stuff
[2839.08 --> 2839.40]  they should
[2839.40 --> 2839.66]  be taking
[2839.66 --> 2840.12]  advantage of.
[2840.14 --> 2840.88]  It's like
[2840.88 --> 2841.74]  parading around
[2841.74 --> 2842.34]  in front of
[2842.34 --> 2843.08]  the White
[2843.08 --> 2843.60]  House with
[2843.60 --> 2844.22]  an I
[2844.22 --> 2844.60]  Support
[2844.60 --> 2845.08]  ISIS
[2845.08 --> 2845.92]  shirt on.
[2846.56 --> 2846.90]  You don't
[2846.90 --> 2847.48]  think someone's
[2847.48 --> 2847.98]  going to ask
[2847.98 --> 2848.32]  what the
[2848.32 --> 2848.84]  crap you're
[2848.84 --> 2849.10]  doing?
[2850.70 --> 2852.08]  So there
[2852.08 --> 2852.60]  you go.
[2852.82 --> 2853.18]  I mean
[2853.18 --> 2855.00]  basically
[2855.00 --> 2856.06]  what the
[2856.06 --> 2856.90]  FBI said
[2856.90 --> 2857.20]  is that
[2857.20 --> 2857.62]  Twitter has
[2857.62 --> 2858.38]  proved to
[2858.38 --> 2858.64]  be an
[2858.64 --> 2859.12]  invaluable
[2859.12 --> 2859.68]  source of
[2859.68 --> 2859.96]  evidence
[2859.96 --> 2860.28]  against
[2860.28 --> 2860.80]  supporters
[2860.80 --> 2861.00]  of
[2861.00 --> 2861.48]  terrorism.
[2862.18 --> 2862.54]  An
[2862.54 --> 2862.78]  account
[2862.78 --> 2863.04]  that's
[2863.04 --> 2863.46]  constantly
[2863.46 --> 2864.04]  retweeting
[2864.04 --> 2864.58]  content
[2864.58 --> 2865.26]  could be a
[2865.26 --> 2865.66]  sign of
[2865.66 --> 2865.96]  criminal
[2865.96 --> 2866.44]  activity.
[2866.70 --> 2867.02]  With that
[2867.02 --> 2867.26]  said,
[2867.34 --> 2868.18]  context still
[2868.18 --> 2868.58]  matters.
[2868.80 --> 2869.64]  So if it's
[2869.64 --> 2869.92]  like an
[2869.92 --> 2870.36]  awareness
[2870.36 --> 2871.48]  like these
[2871.48 --> 2873.58]  are bad
[2873.58 --> 2874.28]  accounts or
[2874.28 --> 2874.76]  maybe this
[2874.76 --> 2875.06]  is what
[2875.06 --> 2875.70]  they're doing,
[2876.04 --> 2876.70]  make sure
[2876.70 --> 2877.38]  you know
[2877.38 --> 2878.30]  kind of style
[2878.30 --> 2878.80]  thing, I'm
[2878.80 --> 2879.52]  sure it's fine.
[2879.52 --> 2880.08]  But if
[2880.08 --> 2880.60]  you're like a
[2880.60 --> 2881.24]  rah-rah
[2881.24 --> 2881.88]  kind of
[2881.88 --> 2882.34]  account, then
[2882.34 --> 2882.68]  it's probably
[2882.68 --> 2883.24]  are you okay?
[2883.30 --> 2883.60]  I bit my
[2883.60 --> 2883.92]  tongue.
[2884.18 --> 2884.38]  Ow.
[2884.38 --> 2885.24]  That sucks.
[2886.26 --> 2886.60]  You know what
[2886.60 --> 2887.12]  really sucks is
[2887.12 --> 2887.52]  when you bite
[2887.52 --> 2888.70]  your cheek or
[2888.70 --> 2890.00]  your tongue and
[2890.00 --> 2890.48]  then you go to
[2890.48 --> 2891.08]  like check it and
[2891.08 --> 2891.54]  then bite the
[2891.54 --> 2891.94]  other thing.
[2893.02 --> 2893.80]  So don't do
[2893.80 --> 2894.06]  that.
[2894.56 --> 2895.00]  And when it
[2895.00 --> 2895.66]  swells and you
[2895.66 --> 2896.22]  start biting it
[2896.22 --> 2896.86]  all the time.
[2897.88 --> 2898.18]  And you just
[2898.18 --> 2898.54]  get this like
[2898.54 --> 2899.04]  flab of
[2899.04 --> 2899.44]  cheek skin.
[2899.58 --> 2899.96]  Swelling
[2899.96 --> 2900.82]  unexpectedly is a
[2900.82 --> 2901.40]  big problem for
[2901.40 --> 2901.58]  me.
[2902.02 --> 2902.36]  Is it?
[2902.40 --> 2902.66]  I'm always
[2902.66 --> 2903.18]  swelling up.
[2903.40 --> 2903.96]  I swell
[2903.96 --> 2904.54]  very
[2904.54 --> 2905.26]  expectedly.
[2907.10 --> 2907.46]  Consistently?
[2907.56 --> 2908.32]  Which is always
[2908.32 --> 2908.88]  during the wine
[2908.88 --> 2909.14]  show.
[2911.24 --> 2912.26]  An example of
[2912.26 --> 2912.66]  a tweet that
[2912.66 --> 2913.06]  got someone
[2913.06 --> 2913.92]  arrested was
[2913.92 --> 2915.02]  17-year-old
[2915.02 --> 2916.12]  Ali Shoukri
[2916.12 --> 2916.70]  Amin,
[2917.10 --> 2917.84]  17,
[2918.06 --> 2918.72]  okay that's
[2918.72 --> 2919.12]  twice there,
[2919.38 --> 2920.12]  who used
[2920.12 --> 2920.70]  Twitter to
[2920.70 --> 2921.20]  promote
[2921.20 --> 2921.70]  Bitcoin
[2921.70 --> 2922.34]  donations
[2922.34 --> 2923.64]  to ISIS.
[2926.64 --> 2927.16]  So,
[2927.68 --> 2928.34]  go to jail.
[2928.94 --> 2929.14]  Yeah.
[2929.96 --> 2930.72]  Bye-bye.
[2930.88 --> 2931.12]  I don't know.
[2931.60 --> 2932.18]  Bye-bye.
[2932.38 --> 2933.70]  Again, I don't
[2933.70 --> 2934.32]  understand why
[2934.32 --> 2934.58]  they even
[2934.58 --> 2935.10]  bothered to tell
[2935.10 --> 2935.88]  us because they
[2935.88 --> 2936.32]  should have just
[2936.32 --> 2937.16]  been doing this.
[2937.16 --> 2938.10]  This seems
[2938.10 --> 2939.26]  extremely expected.
[2939.56 --> 2939.96]  A lot of the
[2939.96 --> 2940.58]  news this week
[2940.58 --> 2941.10]  is like,
[2941.48 --> 2941.76]  yep,
[2942.76 --> 2944.00]  someone made a
[2944.00 --> 2944.58]  parent company
[2944.58 --> 2945.30]  for themselves.
[2945.68 --> 2946.40]  Elon Musk's
[2946.40 --> 2947.18]  business models
[2947.18 --> 2948.02]  make it so that
[2948.02 --> 2948.66]  they bleed money
[2948.66 --> 2949.18]  at the beginning
[2949.18 --> 2950.30]  and you
[2950.30 --> 2951.04]  probably shouldn't
[2951.04 --> 2951.62]  be friends with
[2951.62 --> 2952.00]  terrorists.
[2954.62 --> 2955.66]  Alright, so
[2955.66 --> 2957.70]  this is just a
[2957.70 --> 2958.34]  really quick one.
[2958.46 --> 2958.86]  The original
[2958.86 --> 2959.54]  article here is
[2959.54 --> 2960.78]  pcgamer.com.
[2961.10 --> 2961.62]  Microsoft
[2961.62 --> 2962.60]  plans to
[2962.60 --> 2963.44]  support
[2963.44 --> 2965.42]  gaming on
[2965.42 --> 2967.28]  Windows by
[2967.28 --> 2968.28]  supporting
[2968.28 --> 2969.24]  Steam on
[2969.24 --> 2970.64]  Windows 10
[2970.64 --> 2971.54]  or something.
[2972.46 --> 2972.92]  Games for
[2972.92 --> 2973.62]  Windows was a
[2973.62 --> 2974.20]  prior approach
[2974.20 --> 2974.64]  where it was
[2974.64 --> 2975.46]  more at the
[2975.46 --> 2975.94]  time like,
[2976.58 --> 2977.08]  how do we
[2977.08 --> 2978.16]  take things?
[2979.02 --> 2979.60]  We knew we
[2979.60 --> 2980.02]  wanted to help
[2980.02 --> 2980.40]  make great
[2980.40 --> 2980.78]  multiplayer.
[2981.22 --> 2981.56]  We knew we
[2981.56 --> 2982.04]  wanted to bring
[2982.04 --> 2982.48]  things over,
[2982.58 --> 2982.90]  but it wasn't
[2982.90 --> 2983.56]  the right approach.
[2984.16 --> 2984.52]  It was the
[2984.52 --> 2985.14]  approach of let's
[2985.14 --> 2985.72]  just take things
[2985.72 --> 2986.26]  and transplant
[2986.26 --> 2986.70]  them.
[2987.26 --> 2987.52]  You know,
[2987.70 --> 2987.98]  something,
[2988.08 --> 2988.28]  something.
[2988.54 --> 2988.70]  And is
[2988.70 --> 2989.02]  Microsoft
[2989.02 --> 2989.50]  planning to
[2989.50 --> 2989.72]  use the
[2989.72 --> 2989.92]  Windows
[2989.92 --> 2990.28]  user base
[2990.28 --> 2990.66]  to challenge
[2990.66 --> 2990.92]  Steam?
[2991.02 --> 2991.30]  No!
[2991.82 --> 2992.18]  We're not
[2992.18 --> 2992.64]  intending to
[2992.64 --> 2993.04]  compete with
[2993.04 --> 2993.22]  Steam.
[2993.28 --> 2993.62]  If anything,
[2993.70 --> 2994.02]  we want them
[2994.02 --> 2994.34]  to be more
[2994.34 --> 2994.78]  successful.
[2995.04 --> 2995.30]  They've done
[2995.30 --> 2995.70]  great things
[2995.70 --> 2996.34]  for PC gamers.
[2996.34 --> 2996.74]  Microsoft is
[2996.74 --> 2996.96]  going to
[2996.96 --> 2997.82]  support Steam
[2997.82 --> 2998.52]  by doing
[2998.52 --> 2999.02]  nothing.
[3000.32 --> 3000.84]  They're going
[3000.84 --> 3001.22]  to support
[3001.22 --> 3001.70]  Steam by
[3001.70 --> 3002.76]  not directly
[3002.76 --> 3003.26]  inhibiting
[3003.26 --> 3003.72]  Steam's
[3003.72 --> 3004.18]  progress.
[3004.74 --> 3004.92]  Yeah,
[3005.28 --> 3005.98]  so that's
[3005.98 --> 3006.24]  cool,
[3006.32 --> 3006.62]  I guess.
[3007.62 --> 3008.06]  DirectX12,
[3008.22 --> 3008.32]  well,
[3008.36 --> 3009.30]  apparently not.
[3009.50 --> 3009.60]  Oh,
[3009.62 --> 3009.82]  that was
[3009.82 --> 3010.28]  posted by
[3010.28 --> 3011.00]  Zmule on
[3011.00 --> 3011.36]  the forum,
[3011.42 --> 3011.78]  by the way,
[3011.82 --> 3012.00]  and the
[3012.00 --> 3012.42]  previous one
[3012.42 --> 3012.84]  was Artie.
[3013.26 --> 3014.06]  This is by
[3014.06 --> 3015.20]  HK05,
[3016.00 --> 3016.30]  and the
[3016.30 --> 3016.78]  original article
[3016.78 --> 3017.12]  here is
[3017.12 --> 3018.62]  pchronline.biz.
[3020.78 --> 3021.68]  And our
[3021.68 --> 3023.02]  headline topic
[3023.02 --> 3023.48]  of mantle
[3023.48 --> 3024.16]  being dead
[3024.16 --> 3025.56]  is apparently
[3025.56 --> 3027.24]  not factual.
[3028.04 --> 3028.30]  So,
[3028.38 --> 3029.26]  AMD's
[3029.26 --> 3029.56]  gaming
[3029.56 --> 3030.22]  scientist,
[3030.32 --> 3030.50]  Richard
[3030.50 --> 3030.68]  Howdy.
[3030.74 --> 3031.36]  What is
[3031.36 --> 3031.82]  with,
[3031.82 --> 3033.40]  what is
[3033.40 --> 3034.28]  with these
[3034.28 --> 3034.76]  titles?
[3036.36 --> 3036.66]  Like,
[3037.04 --> 3037.66]  Min Lang Tan,
[3037.86 --> 3038.42]  nice guy,
[3038.58 --> 3039.02]  gave me this
[3039.02 --> 3039.48]  laptop,
[3040.18 --> 3040.74]  calls himself
[3040.74 --> 3041.38]  chief gamer.
[3045.78 --> 3046.50]  Gaming
[3046.50 --> 3047.04]  scientist.
[3047.04 --> 3047.22]  scientist.
[3048.22 --> 3048.48]  Like,
[3049.04 --> 3049.46]  it's like,
[3049.50 --> 3050.18]  what?
[3050.28 --> 3050.66]  Did everyone
[3050.66 --> 3051.10]  at AMD
[3051.10 --> 3051.82]  play Portal?
[3052.48 --> 3053.02]  And so,
[3053.82 --> 3054.22]  it's like,
[3054.54 --> 3054.80]  yes,
[3055.14 --> 3055.68]  we need to
[3055.68 --> 3056.06]  do more
[3056.06 --> 3056.62]  science.
[3057.00 --> 3057.38]  Also,
[3057.60 --> 3058.14]  we need to
[3058.14 --> 3058.56]  sell things
[3058.56 --> 3059.12]  to gamers.
[3059.94 --> 3060.56]  What about
[3060.56 --> 3061.72]  gaming and
[3061.72 --> 3062.30]  science
[3062.30 --> 3063.22]  together?
[3064.10 --> 3064.46]  And then
[3064.46 --> 3064.84]  there's the
[3064.84 --> 3065.54]  Logitech's
[3065.54 --> 3065.78]  whole,
[3065.88 --> 3066.08]  like,
[3066.14 --> 3066.58]  standing there
[3066.58 --> 3066.78]  going,
[3066.88 --> 3067.00]  well,
[3067.08 --> 3067.42]  actually,
[3067.52 --> 3067.74]  hold on
[3067.74 --> 3067.94]  a second,
[3068.00 --> 3068.62]  our tagline
[3068.62 --> 3068.82]  is,
[3068.94 --> 3069.00]  like,
[3069.06 --> 3069.34]  science
[3069.34 --> 3069.64]  wins,
[3069.82 --> 3069.98]  so,
[3069.98 --> 3070.84]  can you
[3070.84 --> 3071.32]  just not,
[3071.72 --> 3072.46]  actually?
[3072.46 --> 3074.66]  So,
[3074.90 --> 3075.52]  Mantle was
[3075.52 --> 3076.18]  intended to
[3076.18 --> 3076.64]  solve a
[3076.64 --> 3078.66]  problem that
[3078.66 --> 3079.40]  game devs care
[3079.40 --> 3079.74]  about.
[3080.20 --> 3080.92]  They can use
[3080.92 --> 3081.28]  it for the
[3081.28 --> 3082.02]  same task in
[3082.02 --> 3082.54]  the future,
[3083.00 --> 3083.30]  although,
[3083.62 --> 3084.64]  no one is
[3084.64 --> 3085.06]  going to
[3085.06 --> 3086.44]  develop
[3086.44 --> 3087.76]  an API
[3087.76 --> 3088.76]  that is,
[3088.92 --> 3089.30]  anyway.
[3090.44 --> 3091.34]  DirectX 12
[3091.34 --> 3091.98]  means Mantle
[3091.98 --> 3092.46]  has achieved
[3092.46 --> 3092.98]  its aim,
[3093.50 --> 3093.82]  although,
[3094.40 --> 3095.40]  I mean,
[3096.48 --> 3097.24]  DirectX 12
[3097.24 --> 3097.58]  was in
[3097.58 --> 3097.92]  development
[3097.92 --> 3100.30]  way before
[3100.30 --> 3101.30]  AMD,
[3101.56 --> 3102.08]  anyone even
[3102.08 --> 3102.70]  knew that
[3102.70 --> 3103.38]  Mantle was
[3103.38 --> 3103.74]  a thing.
[3104.70 --> 3105.38]  Mantle will
[3105.38 --> 3106.02]  be used to
[3106.02 --> 3106.68]  solve different
[3106.68 --> 3107.28]  problems in
[3107.28 --> 3107.80]  the future.
[3110.46 --> 3110.98]  No,
[3111.34 --> 3111.90]  Mantle has
[3111.90 --> 3113.28]  been absorbed
[3113.28 --> 3115.44]  by Kronos,
[3115.74 --> 3116.20]  and,
[3116.54 --> 3116.84]  you know,
[3116.92 --> 3117.80]  any useful,
[3118.06 --> 3118.66]  you know,
[3118.84 --> 3119.48]  tidbits of
[3119.48 --> 3120.44]  it have been
[3120.44 --> 3121.56]  borrowed by
[3121.56 --> 3122.50]  DirectX 12,
[3122.72 --> 3123.52]  and that's
[3123.52 --> 3123.66]  it.
[3123.70 --> 3123.96]  I really
[3123.96 --> 3124.44]  don't know
[3124.44 --> 3124.84]  why.
[3125.44 --> 3125.62]  Like,
[3125.80 --> 3126.06]  okay,
[3126.30 --> 3127.26]  to be clear,
[3127.42 --> 3128.02]  I see what
[3128.02 --> 3128.58]  he's saying.
[3129.00 --> 3129.18]  Like,
[3129.24 --> 3129.94]  Mantle will
[3129.94 --> 3130.56]  live on,
[3130.64 --> 3130.90]  like,
[3131.32 --> 3131.60]  you know,
[3131.60 --> 3132.28]  in the DNA
[3132.28 --> 3132.84]  of other
[3132.84 --> 3133.48]  technologies.
[3133.78 --> 3134.30]  The concept
[3134.30 --> 3134.86]  of Mantle,
[3134.92 --> 3135.36]  the goals
[3135.36 --> 3135.88]  of Mantle
[3135.88 --> 3136.28]  will live
[3136.28 --> 3136.58]  on,
[3137.08 --> 3138.88]  but it's
[3138.88 --> 3139.80]  possible that
[3139.80 --> 3141.10]  Battlefield 4
[3141.10 --> 3141.60]  is the only
[3141.60 --> 3142.04]  game,
[3142.16 --> 3142.52]  or whatever,
[3142.66 --> 3142.90]  Thief,
[3142.98 --> 3143.34]  I guess.
[3143.82 --> 3144.50]  Battlefield 4,
[3144.56 --> 3144.72]  like,
[3144.72 --> 3145.28]  the games that
[3145.28 --> 3145.94]  are out now
[3145.94 --> 3146.56]  are possibly
[3146.56 --> 3147.26]  the only games
[3147.26 --> 3147.92]  that will ever
[3147.92 --> 3148.78]  exist where you
[3148.78 --> 3149.20]  change your
[3149.20 --> 3149.80]  rendering engine
[3149.80 --> 3150.32]  to Mantle.
[3150.50 --> 3150.78]  And then,
[3150.84 --> 3151.34]  even then,
[3151.64 --> 3152.10]  it didn't really
[3152.10 --> 3152.42]  do anything.
[3154.76 --> 3155.12]  Yeah,
[3155.18 --> 3155.78]  I think that was
[3155.78 --> 3156.42]  my favorite part
[3156.42 --> 3156.92]  of the whole thing.
[3156.92 --> 3157.20]  At least it
[3157.20 --> 3157.76]  wasn't worse.
[3159.42 --> 3160.16]  They didn't make
[3160.16 --> 3160.48]  it worse.
[3160.62 --> 3161.00]  Mantle!
[3161.00 --> 3161.90]  At least it
[3161.90 --> 3162.58]  wasn't worse.
[3163.80 --> 3164.58]  They didn't
[3164.58 --> 3165.30]  hurt people
[3165.30 --> 3166.12]  for using it,
[3166.74 --> 3168.16]  which is good.
[3170.20 --> 3170.94]  All right,
[3171.18 --> 3172.36]  this is cool.
[3173.70 --> 3175.08]  News.sky.com.
[3175.12 --> 3175.58]  We're lagging like crazy.
[3175.72 --> 3175.90]  Sorry?
[3176.26 --> 3177.18]  We're lagging like crazy.
[3177.28 --> 3177.66]  I know we're not
[3177.66 --> 3178.24]  dropping freights,
[3178.42 --> 3179.16]  but everyone's
[3179.16 --> 3179.54]  freaking out.
[3179.64 --> 3180.06]  Oh, okay.
[3180.30 --> 3180.98]  Well, nothing we can do
[3180.98 --> 3181.32]  about that.
[3181.46 --> 3181.60]  That's all.
[3181.80 --> 3181.90]  Yeah.
[3182.90 --> 3183.64]  Sky News says,
[3183.64 --> 3184.78]  the UK to test
[3184.78 --> 3186.36]  wireless charging
[3186.36 --> 3187.84]  for electric cars.
[3188.22 --> 3189.66]  So check that out.
[3190.12 --> 3191.12]  This right here
[3191.12 --> 3192.42]  is an electric
[3192.42 --> 3193.84]  recharging lane.
[3194.18 --> 3195.90]  So as you drive,
[3196.00 --> 3197.22]  your car would recharge.
[3197.48 --> 3198.74]  That is some
[3198.74 --> 3200.52]  seriously awesome
[3200.52 --> 3202.32]  use of taxpayer dollars.
[3202.54 --> 3203.68]  If Canada decided
[3203.68 --> 3204.36]  to do stuff like that,
[3204.40 --> 3205.00]  and you wouldn't have
[3205.00 --> 3205.62]  to do it everywhere
[3205.62 --> 3207.26]  because the plan
[3207.26 --> 3207.68]  in the UK
[3207.68 --> 3208.60]  is also to put
[3208.60 --> 3209.22]  charging stations
[3209.22 --> 3210.56]  I think every 20 miles
[3210.56 --> 3211.28]  or something stupid
[3211.28 --> 3211.68]  like that.
[3211.80 --> 3213.02]  Like just awesome.
[3213.70 --> 3214.50]  But the idea
[3214.50 --> 3215.36]  is that if you put
[3215.36 --> 3215.96]  that on the main
[3215.96 --> 3216.32]  throw first,
[3216.58 --> 3217.16]  like imagine
[3217.16 --> 3218.42]  if you have that
[3218.42 --> 3219.16]  where people get
[3219.16 --> 3219.80]  stuck in traffic.
[3221.06 --> 3221.76]  So if you're
[3221.76 --> 3222.30]  going to be stuck
[3222.30 --> 3222.82]  in traffic
[3222.82 --> 3223.44]  and your battery
[3223.44 --> 3224.10]  is going to be draining,
[3224.24 --> 3224.80]  you got your air
[3224.80 --> 3225.66]  conditioning on
[3225.66 --> 3226.14]  or whatever,
[3226.58 --> 3227.86]  hey, it's all good.
[3228.18 --> 3228.78]  I'm not going
[3228.78 --> 3229.74]  to get stuck here.
[3230.18 --> 3231.06]  Whereas if you're
[3231.06 --> 3231.98]  just going on
[3231.98 --> 3233.70]  a trip off the main
[3233.70 --> 3234.34]  drag where you've
[3234.34 --> 3235.44]  got the charging lanes,
[3235.88 --> 3236.52]  then that's fine.
[3236.52 --> 3237.32]  That's predictable.
[3238.16 --> 3238.90]  I love this.
[3238.94 --> 3239.98]  This is like the coolest
[3239.98 --> 3241.30]  thing ever pretty much.
[3241.30 --> 3241.80]  That's super cool.
[3242.50 --> 3243.14]  What is there
[3243.14 --> 3243.94]  to really say about it?
[3244.38 --> 3245.02]  British government
[3245.02 --> 3245.58]  has committed
[3245.58 --> 3248.12]  500 million pounds
[3248.12 --> 3249.46]  over the next five years
[3249.46 --> 3250.06]  to keep Britain
[3250.06 --> 3250.68]  at the forefront
[3250.68 --> 3251.62]  of this technology
[3251.62 --> 3252.62]  and the trials
[3252.62 --> 3253.38]  are expected to last
[3253.38 --> 3253.94]  for approximately
[3253.94 --> 3254.72]  18 months
[3254.72 --> 3256.10]  and subject to the results
[3256.10 --> 3256.74]  could be followed
[3256.74 --> 3257.64]  by road trials.
[3257.84 --> 3258.70]  This makes a lot more sense
[3258.70 --> 3259.86]  than like solar roadways.
[3260.00 --> 3260.48]  Yes, it does.
[3260.68 --> 3261.64]  Yeah, because that was
[3261.64 --> 3262.78]  a whole load of crap.
[3263.72 --> 3264.52]  Yeah, it was kind of funny
[3264.52 --> 3265.52]  how the internet exploded.
[3265.52 --> 3266.22]  exploded.
[3266.36 --> 3267.10]  Like I could almost
[3267.10 --> 3269.86]  see like some kind
[3269.86 --> 3272.76]  of like heated roadways
[3272.76 --> 3273.90]  versus electric
[3273.90 --> 3275.30]  like solar panel roadways.
[3275.40 --> 3276.90]  Like there's a thousand
[3276.90 --> 3279.08]  other ways to tackle
[3279.08 --> 3280.46]  that that wouldn't involve
[3280.46 --> 3282.28]  completely tearing up
[3282.28 --> 3283.20]  every single road.
[3283.38 --> 3283.66]  Yeah.
[3284.04 --> 3285.46]  One tip for the live
[3285.46 --> 3286.34]  viewers, by the way.
[3286.70 --> 3287.72]  Apparently refreshing
[3287.72 --> 3288.62]  the stream helps a lot.
[3288.92 --> 3289.92]  Anyways, keep on going.
[3289.92 --> 3290.36]  So it doesn't seem
[3290.36 --> 3290.76]  to be us.
[3290.76 --> 3292.42]  HTC stock value
[3292.42 --> 3293.56]  is tanking.
[3293.64 --> 3294.34]  Apparently it's less
[3294.34 --> 3295.44]  than their cash holdings
[3295.44 --> 3296.38]  which renders them
[3296.38 --> 3297.40]  more or less
[3297.40 --> 3298.24]  worth nothing.
[3299.40 --> 3300.26]  Which is
[3300.26 --> 3301.66]  not great.
[3301.74 --> 3302.38]  And the sad thing
[3302.38 --> 3302.88]  about that
[3302.88 --> 3303.64]  is that
[3303.64 --> 3305.26]  we really need
[3305.26 --> 3305.96]  Vibe to come out.
[3306.22 --> 3306.86]  No, no, no.
[3307.18 --> 3307.82]  Well that too.
[3307.92 --> 3308.28]  We do.
[3308.76 --> 3309.76]  Yeah, Vibe looks badass.
[3310.06 --> 3310.22]  Yeah.
[3310.22 --> 3311.40]  So get this.
[3311.92 --> 3313.46]  HTC trading below
[3313.46 --> 3314.66]  their cash value
[3314.66 --> 3315.90]  leaves the brand
[3315.90 --> 3316.58]  with no value.
[3316.74 --> 3317.92]  Not just the brand
[3317.92 --> 3318.68]  with no value.
[3318.96 --> 3319.16]  Okay?
[3319.88 --> 3320.70]  This leaves
[3320.70 --> 3321.74]  their buildings
[3321.74 --> 3323.00]  that they own
[3323.00 --> 3325.00]  with no value.
[3325.22 --> 3326.06]  So basically
[3326.06 --> 3327.02]  the consensus
[3327.02 --> 3327.82]  is that
[3327.82 --> 3329.54]  their liabilities
[3329.54 --> 3331.06]  things like
[3331.06 --> 3331.60]  that I think
[3331.60 --> 3332.10]  something like
[3332.10 --> 3333.76]  30% of their assets
[3333.76 --> 3334.74]  are inventory.
[3336.24 --> 3336.74]  30%
[3336.74 --> 3337.12]  yeah,
[3337.24 --> 3338.68]  30% of the asset value
[3338.68 --> 3339.86]  comes from inventory
[3339.86 --> 3340.78]  and accounts receivable.
[3341.20 --> 3341.92]  So they're saying
[3341.92 --> 3343.16]  that their liabilities
[3343.16 --> 3345.56]  more than compensate
[3345.56 --> 3347.52]  for buildings
[3347.52 --> 3348.98]  that they own.
[3349.12 --> 3349.46]  Oh.
[3349.50 --> 3351.44]  And that the HTC brand
[3351.44 --> 3352.10]  itself,
[3352.28 --> 3353.28]  that HTC logo
[3353.28 --> 3354.76]  is effectively worth
[3354.76 --> 3355.64]  nothing.
[3357.32 --> 3358.08]  Wow.
[3358.96 --> 3360.52]  So to be clear
[3360.52 --> 3362.74]  this is not
[3362.74 --> 3364.12]  something that happened
[3364.12 --> 3364.58]  overnight.
[3364.86 --> 3365.46]  They had
[3365.46 --> 3367.42]  $27.9 billion
[3367.42 --> 3368.54]  in cash.
[3368.68 --> 3369.50]  in 2011
[3369.50 --> 3370.56]  and now have
[3370.56 --> 3371.04]  just over
[3371.04 --> 3372.78]  $1.45 billion.
[3375.04 --> 3375.48]  Okay.
[3376.00 --> 3376.50]  And you gotta look
[3376.50 --> 3377.02]  at it and go
[3377.02 --> 3377.60]  you know
[3377.60 --> 3378.28]  if Tesla
[3378.28 --> 3379.38]  can make a car
[3379.38 --> 3380.50]  for a billion dollars
[3380.50 --> 3381.24]  what have you
[3381.24 --> 3381.70]  been doing?
[3381.78 --> 3383.12]  What did HTC
[3383.12 --> 3383.86]  do with it?
[3385.66 --> 3386.30]  That's only
[3386.30 --> 3387.10]  four years.
[3387.32 --> 3387.86]  They have no
[3387.86 --> 3388.92]  long-term debt.
[3389.38 --> 3389.98]  I mean that makes
[3389.98 --> 3390.52]  sense because they
[3390.52 --> 3392.06]  had $28 billion
[3392.06 --> 3392.68]  in the bank.
[3392.74 --> 3393.28]  Why would they be
[3393.28 --> 3394.16]  taking out loans?
[3394.16 --> 3395.66]  but they haven't
[3395.66 --> 3396.24]  managed to be
[3396.24 --> 3397.62]  profitable and
[3397.62 --> 3398.94]  basically
[3398.94 --> 3400.56]  the word on
[3400.56 --> 3401.52]  the general
[3401.52 --> 3402.36]  consensus among
[3402.36 --> 3403.04]  industry analysts
[3403.04 --> 3403.50]  is that they
[3403.50 --> 3404.06]  won't be able to
[3404.06 --> 3404.60]  get profitable
[3404.60 --> 3406.62]  and yeah
[3406.62 --> 3407.92]  they have little
[3407.92 --> 3408.96]  chance to compete
[3408.96 --> 3410.02]  with future iPhone
[3410.02 --> 3410.88]  and Samsung
[3410.88 --> 3411.70]  devices.
[3411.70 --> 3412.34]  Yeah I seriously
[3412.34 --> 3412.90]  doubt that
[3412.90 --> 3413.60]  to be completely
[3413.60 --> 3413.92]  honest.
[3414.20 --> 3415.34]  I really don't
[3415.34 --> 3416.14]  see people diving
[3416.14 --> 3417.04]  on HTC phones
[3417.04 --> 3417.60]  much lately.
[3418.00 --> 3419.64]  The One M9 is
[3419.64 --> 3421.18]  kind of not great.
[3421.92 --> 3422.74]  I mean I think
[3422.74 --> 3423.44]  my review of it
[3423.44 --> 3424.34]  I did review it
[3424.34 --> 3424.92]  so I've already
[3424.92 --> 3425.46]  said what I had
[3425.46 --> 3426.10]  to say about it
[3426.10 --> 3427.54]  but it's like
[3427.54 --> 3428.56]  kind of not very
[3428.56 --> 3428.86]  great.
[3429.32 --> 3429.54]  Yeah.
[3429.54 --> 3432.68]  And we're going
[3432.68 --> 3434.28]  like even more
[3434.28 --> 3435.02]  than before
[3435.02 --> 3436.00]  we're going down
[3436.00 --> 3436.64]  to just a few
[3436.64 --> 3437.52]  brands on mobile
[3437.52 --> 3438.20]  that really matter.
[3438.36 --> 3439.02]  Yep and I mean
[3439.02 --> 3439.50]  the fact that
[3439.50 --> 3440.50]  Samsung woke up
[3440.50 --> 3440.92]  and stopped
[3440.92 --> 3442.14]  completely crapping
[3442.14 --> 3442.58]  itself.
[3443.18 --> 3444.04]  The S6 and the
[3444.04 --> 3444.60]  S6 Edge are
[3444.60 --> 3445.36]  excellent phones.
[3445.88 --> 3446.56]  There seems to be
[3446.56 --> 3447.24]  a fair bit of hype
[3447.24 --> 3447.94]  about Note 5.
[3448.06 --> 3448.72]  I actually haven't
[3448.72 --> 3450.50]  really I haven't
[3450.50 --> 3452.10]  watched the event
[3452.10 --> 3452.76]  or anything like
[3452.76 --> 3454.62]  that because I
[3454.62 --> 3455.46]  tend to just kind
[3455.46 --> 3457.00]  of take a when I
[3457.00 --> 3457.90]  get a phone then
[3457.90 --> 3458.78]  I'll deal with it
[3458.78 --> 3459.80]  approach to mobile
[3459.80 --> 3460.70]  devices but
[3460.70 --> 3462.30]  I don't blame you
[3462.30 --> 3462.64]  for that.
[3462.76 --> 3463.20]  Yeah it looks like
[3463.20 --> 3463.82]  a fair bit of hype
[3463.82 --> 3464.24]  right now.
[3467.02 --> 3468.18]  Oh that was posted
[3468.18 --> 3469.06]  on the forum by
[3469.06 --> 3470.54]  Mr. Straight Face.
[3471.30 --> 3472.12]  Dupin is apparently
[3472.12 --> 3473.72]  turning back on
[3473.72 --> 3475.06]  their nuclear reactors.
[3475.34 --> 3476.08]  This is
[3476.08 --> 3477.32]  well they were
[3477.32 --> 3478.00]  they were turned
[3478.00 --> 3478.94]  off in response
[3478.94 --> 3480.34]  to a meltdown
[3480.34 --> 3481.32]  back in
[3481.32 --> 3483.04]  2011.
[3483.46 --> 3484.18]  So the Fukushima
[3484.18 --> 3484.84]  meltdown
[3484.84 --> 3486.76]  basically shut down
[3486.76 --> 3487.62]  all the nation's
[3487.62 --> 3488.64]  nuclear power plants
[3488.64 --> 3489.90]  and then they
[3489.90 --> 3490.68]  switched the first
[3490.68 --> 3492.30]  one back on
[3492.30 --> 3493.92]  as of looks like
[3493.92 --> 3495.06]  about three days
[3495.06 --> 3495.38]  ago.
[3495.62 --> 3496.72]  So there is a
[3496.72 --> 3497.60]  higher tsunami
[3497.60 --> 3499.16]  wall and a lot
[3499.16 --> 3499.98]  of new security
[3499.98 --> 3500.44]  measures.
[3500.44 --> 3501.52]  The new regulations
[3501.52 --> 3502.76]  are incomparably
[3502.76 --> 3504.02]  stricter than the
[3504.02 --> 3505.56]  past and this is
[3505.56 --> 3506.48]  likely in response
[3506.48 --> 3507.18]  to the energy
[3507.18 --> 3508.40]  prices in Japan
[3508.40 --> 3510.34]  skyrocketing by
[3510.34 --> 3512.22]  30 percent in the
[3512.22 --> 3512.96]  last four years.
[3513.04 --> 3514.08]  I mean the cold
[3514.08 --> 3515.34]  hard truth is that
[3515.34 --> 3516.68]  nuclear power for
[3516.68 --> 3517.96]  all of its risks.
[3517.96 --> 3519.50]  Like it's such a
[3519.50 --> 3521.98]  catch-22 right?
[3522.50 --> 3523.50]  Because the
[3523.50 --> 3524.50]  It's like driving
[3524.50 --> 3524.86]  though.
[3525.36 --> 3525.84]  Because when people
[3525.84 --> 3526.46]  are like oh they
[3526.46 --> 3527.26]  shouldn't increase
[3527.26 --> 3528.54]  speed limits because
[3528.54 --> 3529.48]  they're more dangerous.
[3529.68 --> 3531.12]  It's like well we
[3531.12 --> 3531.96]  also shouldn't drive
[3531.96 --> 3532.78]  30 everywhere.
[3534.08 --> 3534.92]  And the issue
[3534.92 --> 3535.60]  sometimes you need to
[3535.60 --> 3536.54]  take some risks.
[3537.54 --> 3538.20]  And I mean that's
[3538.20 --> 3539.04]  easy for us to say
[3539.04 --> 3540.02]  like way over here in
[3540.02 --> 3540.74]  Canada where we're
[3540.74 --> 3541.44]  just powered by
[3541.44 --> 3542.66]  falling water which
[3542.66 --> 3544.10]  is about as
[3544.10 --> 3544.96]  dangerous to people
[3544.96 --> 3545.90]  who aren't sitting
[3545.90 --> 3547.72]  under the dam as
[3547.72 --> 3549.70]  like I mean it's
[3549.70 --> 3550.88]  less dangerous than
[3550.88 --> 3551.88]  solar power because
[3551.88 --> 3553.24]  the sun is like
[3553.24 --> 3554.18]  cancer and whatnot.
[3554.66 --> 3554.90]  No.
[3555.80 --> 3556.80]  Well it's more than
[3556.80 --> 3557.30]  water.
[3558.14 --> 3558.38]  No.
[3558.72 --> 3559.74]  Because a dam burst
[3559.74 --> 3560.48]  can be dangerous.
[3560.60 --> 3561.38]  But we're not under
[3561.38 --> 3561.56]  it.
[3562.44 --> 3563.30]  So the dam is
[3563.30 --> 3564.12]  hundreds and
[3564.12 --> 3564.62]  hundreds of
[3564.62 --> 3565.30]  kilometers away.
[3565.38 --> 3565.96]  What do we care?
[3566.42 --> 3567.18]  Yeah but solar
[3567.18 --> 3568.26]  power isn't going to
[3568.26 --> 3568.74]  hurt you.
[3569.08 --> 3570.98]  But the sun has to
[3570.98 --> 3571.20]  be.
[3571.20 --> 3571.24]  Yeah but you can't
[3571.24 --> 3572.30]  just get rid of the
[3572.30 --> 3572.98]  sun if you don't
[3572.98 --> 3574.02]  want solar power.
[3574.28 --> 3575.12]  It's going to be
[3575.12 --> 3575.98]  there anyways.
[3576.34 --> 3577.16]  The sun isn't there
[3577.16 --> 3577.98]  because of solar
[3577.98 --> 3578.24]  power.
[3578.32 --> 3579.18]  Okay my point is that
[3579.18 --> 3580.14]  hydro power is.
[3580.14 --> 3580.90]  BC Hydro didn't
[3580.90 --> 3581.84]  install the sun.
[3581.98 --> 3582.56]  My point is that
[3582.56 --> 3583.86]  hydro power is safe
[3583.86 --> 3584.98]  for the people who
[3584.98 --> 3585.94]  aren't near the dam.
[3586.04 --> 3586.32]  Okay?
[3587.26 --> 3587.70]  Yeah.
[3587.82 --> 3588.74]  But it's like this
[3588.74 --> 3589.96]  catch-22 because the
[3589.96 --> 3591.16]  denser your population
[3591.16 --> 3593.48]  the more optimal
[3593.48 --> 3595.02]  nuclear power looks
[3595.02 --> 3596.14]  because you don't
[3596.14 --> 3596.88]  have to burn all
[3596.88 --> 3597.50]  this coal.
[3598.00 --> 3599.06]  You don't have like
[3599.06 --> 3599.62]  you know.
[3599.76 --> 3600.74]  Solar power fields.
[3601.00 --> 3602.34]  Hectares and hectares
[3602.34 --> 3603.62]  of you know wind
[3603.62 --> 3605.80]  mills and crap like
[3605.80 --> 3606.10]  that.
[3606.18 --> 3606.74]  Wind power.
[3607.34 --> 3608.78]  So but the denser
[3608.78 --> 3610.50]  your population well
[3610.50 --> 3611.70]  the higher risk
[3611.70 --> 3612.74]  nuclear power is.
[3612.82 --> 3613.54]  The more people have
[3613.54 --> 3614.36]  to be near a nuclear
[3614.36 --> 3614.92]  power plant.
[3614.94 --> 3615.06]  And we're working
[3615.06 --> 3616.86]  on stuff like.
[3617.58 --> 3618.32]  We are personally?
[3618.64 --> 3619.16]  Yes.
[3619.64 --> 3619.92]  Yes.
[3620.36 --> 3620.66]  Yes.
[3620.66 --> 3621.72]  That's what this new
[3621.72 --> 3622.54]  headquarters building
[3622.54 --> 3623.00]  is for.
[3623.10 --> 3623.30]  Yes.
[3623.40 --> 3624.18]  It's for the Linus
[3624.18 --> 3624.58]  We're working on
[3624.58 --> 3625.94]  developing tidal power
[3625.94 --> 3627.88]  in a building away
[3627.88 --> 3628.56]  from the ocean.
[3629.68 --> 3631.20]  With no water
[3631.20 --> 3631.74]  facilities.
[3631.74 --> 3632.54]  We could be closer
[3632.54 --> 3633.48]  to the ocean than
[3633.48 --> 3634.02]  you think.
[3634.08 --> 3634.74]  Two washrooms.
[3634.74 --> 3635.56]  We're working on
[3635.56 --> 3636.76]  technology that will
[3636.76 --> 3637.70]  actually have the
[3637.70 --> 3638.72]  ocean here.
[3638.86 --> 3639.14]  Yeah.
[3640.60 --> 3641.16]  Sick.
[3641.94 --> 3642.50]  Anyways.
[3642.88 --> 3643.24]  Yeah.
[3643.38 --> 3644.10]  Tidal power.
[3644.52 --> 3645.34]  Geothermal is being
[3645.34 --> 3646.48]  revolutionized constantly.
[3646.98 --> 3647.32]  Solar.
[3647.32 --> 3648.76]  Getting solar more
[3648.76 --> 3649.32]  ubiquitous.
[3649.46 --> 3650.14]  Like getting every
[3650.14 --> 3650.86]  building with solar
[3650.86 --> 3651.44]  on top of it will
[3651.44 --> 3652.88]  make it a lot more
[3652.88 --> 3653.26]  effective.
[3653.50 --> 3653.62]  Yeah.
[3653.68 --> 3654.06]  Big difference.
[3654.66 --> 3655.94]  There's every year
[3655.94 --> 3658.30]  solar like how well
[3658.30 --> 3659.72]  the solar power panels
[3659.72 --> 3661.30]  the cells actually
[3661.30 --> 3662.56]  perform massively
[3662.56 --> 3663.08]  increases.
[3663.58 --> 3664.64]  Storage solutions for
[3664.64 --> 3665.56]  them get way better
[3665.56 --> 3666.24]  like the Tesla
[3666.24 --> 3667.18]  wall power thing.
[3667.18 --> 3668.26]  We have 11,000 viewers
[3668.26 --> 3668.96]  that's a new all time
[3668.96 --> 3669.18]  high.
[3669.44 --> 3669.74]  Yeah.
[3670.20 --> 3670.46]  Woo.
[3671.26 --> 3672.24]  Pizza party.
[3672.90 --> 3674.14]  That gets way better.
[3674.24 --> 3674.96]  Everything gets way
[3674.96 --> 3675.62]  better in terms of
[3675.62 --> 3676.48]  solar every year.
[3676.84 --> 3677.58]  Geothermal is moving
[3677.58 --> 3678.12]  up too.
[3678.50 --> 3679.62]  Tidal power still has a
[3679.62 --> 3680.28]  ton of development
[3680.28 --> 3680.80]  going on.
[3681.04 --> 3681.96]  It's still a little
[3681.96 --> 3683.10]  cray but they've got a
[3683.10 --> 3683.54]  lot of development
[3683.54 --> 3684.00]  going on.
[3684.12 --> 3685.38]  Like alternatives are
[3685.38 --> 3687.12]  coming but nuclear is
[3687.12 --> 3688.36]  strong and here now.
[3688.66 --> 3689.20]  And you can say
[3689.20 --> 3689.94]  whatever you want about
[3689.94 --> 3690.82]  they should maybe be
[3690.82 --> 3691.90]  using thorium reactors
[3691.90 --> 3692.30]  or whatever.
[3692.54 --> 3693.52]  Not only is nuclear
[3693.52 --> 3694.70]  here now they actually
[3694.70 --> 3695.96]  have the plants now.
[3695.96 --> 3696.26]  Yeah.
[3696.26 --> 3697.10]  They just turn them
[3697.10 --> 3698.30]  back on with more
[3698.30 --> 3699.34]  safety measures which
[3699.34 --> 3700.12]  should definitely be a
[3700.12 --> 3700.34]  thing.
[3700.80 --> 3700.92]  Yeah.
[3700.92 --> 3701.82]  Yeah.
[3702.06 --> 3702.54]  Alright.
[3702.78 --> 3703.56]  The ESL.
[3703.66 --> 3704.46]  This is posted by
[3704.46 --> 3706.86]  xyrzbest.
[3707.28 --> 3708.28]  The ESL announces
[3708.28 --> 3709.66]  details of their
[3709.66 --> 3711.88]  anti-doping policy.
[3712.68 --> 3713.66]  So there's actually a
[3713.66 --> 3714.16]  bunch of different
[3714.16 --> 3714.98]  sources for this one.
[3715.02 --> 3715.56]  We're going to pull up
[3715.56 --> 3716.70]  the polygon one just
[3716.70 --> 3718.62]  for because polygons are
[3718.62 --> 3719.56]  cool and they're shapes
[3719.56 --> 3722.86]  and so I like shapes.
[3723.46 --> 3724.50]  So you want to go ahead
[3724.50 --> 3725.90]  and run through what's
[3725.90 --> 3726.36]  going on here?
[3726.58 --> 3727.38]  I also haven't read
[3727.38 --> 3727.66]  this one.
[3727.66 --> 3727.92]  Okay.
[3728.02 --> 3729.28]  Well then fine.
[3729.28 --> 3732.88]  So they adopt the world
[3732.88 --> 3734.14]  anti-doping agency's
[3734.14 --> 3735.16]  prohibited substance.
[3738.54 --> 3738.94]  And...
[3738.94 --> 3740.16]  We're back?
[3740.56 --> 3741.10]  We're back.
[3741.26 --> 3741.42]  Yeah.
[3741.42 --> 3741.72]  Okay.
[3742.04 --> 3742.26]  Woo!
[3742.84 --> 3743.02]  Woo!
[3743.96 --> 3745.14]  Pizza stream.
[3745.36 --> 3745.68]  Yeah.
[3745.86 --> 3746.88]  Taking down the
[3746.88 --> 3747.78]  x-split.
[3748.58 --> 3748.90]  Okay.
[3749.14 --> 3750.42]  So yeah.
[3750.54 --> 3752.34]  We had so many viewers
[3752.34 --> 3753.52]  that like...
[3753.52 --> 3753.80]  That the local
[3753.80 --> 3755.00]  application crashed.
[3755.00 --> 3755.30]  Yeah.
[3756.20 --> 3757.48]  So the...
[3757.48 --> 3759.60]  Doesn't work that way.
[3759.68 --> 3759.84]  Right.
[3760.08 --> 3760.68]  Here's what I was
[3760.68 --> 3761.14]  leaving off.
[3761.24 --> 3762.50]  So you can make all
[3762.50 --> 3763.86]  kinds of arguments for
[3763.86 --> 3766.52]  marijuana not being a
[3766.52 --> 3767.64]  performance enhancing
[3767.64 --> 3768.66]  substance.
[3769.66 --> 3770.08]  I mean...
[3770.08 --> 3771.02]  Although I do know
[3771.02 --> 3772.32]  people that play better
[3772.32 --> 3773.66]  when playing video games
[3773.66 --> 3774.76]  while they're maybe
[3774.76 --> 3776.16]  possibly under the
[3776.16 --> 3776.92]  influence of the
[3776.92 --> 3777.28]  marriage of boys.
[3777.28 --> 3777.60]  Seriously?
[3777.88 --> 3778.14]  Yes.
[3778.56 --> 3779.84]  But that is a
[3779.84 --> 3780.66]  different problem and
[3780.66 --> 3781.36]  that's because they
[3781.36 --> 3783.26]  play more often when
[3783.26 --> 3783.92]  they're under the
[3783.92 --> 3784.24]  influence.
[3784.44 --> 3784.54]  Right.
[3784.70 --> 3785.68]  So it's a regularization
[3785.68 --> 3785.70]  thing.
[3785.70 --> 3786.96]  So it's no secret that
[3786.96 --> 3788.76]  playing under your
[3788.76 --> 3790.58]  ideal conditions where
[3790.58 --> 3791.74]  you've practiced is a
[3791.74 --> 3792.26]  good idea.
[3792.42 --> 3792.58]  Yeah.
[3792.72 --> 3793.78]  But like I mean that
[3793.78 --> 3795.04]  whole thing with Ross
[3795.04 --> 3795.60]  Rebegliati...
[3796.32 --> 3797.12]  Was that...
[3797.12 --> 3798.64]  Was that in like 2004?
[3799.10 --> 3799.60]  I think it's...
[3800.20 --> 3800.50]  Wow.
[3800.60 --> 3800.96]  I'm old.
[3801.70 --> 3802.64]  So a Canadian
[3802.64 --> 3804.46]  snowboarder who...
[3804.46 --> 3805.28]  Did he end up getting
[3805.28 --> 3805.90]  back?
[3806.30 --> 3806.94]  But he had his gold
[3806.94 --> 3808.44]  medal stripped because
[3808.44 --> 3810.36]  of THC and we're
[3810.36 --> 3810.92]  kind of sitting here
[3810.92 --> 3811.40]  going like...
[3811.40 --> 3811.82]  It's a snowboarder.
[3812.58 --> 3813.86]  Snowboarding culture
[3813.86 --> 3816.40]  particularly in the
[3816.40 --> 3817.50]  earlier days.
[3817.52 --> 3818.38]  In the earlier days.
[3818.40 --> 3820.96]  You throw a rock in a
[3820.96 --> 3821.76]  room of Canadian
[3821.76 --> 3822.84]  snowboarders and you're
[3822.84 --> 3823.52]  going to hit someone
[3823.52 --> 3824.52]  who's smoked a little
[3824.52 --> 3825.52]  bit of grass in their
[3825.52 --> 3825.82]  day.
[3826.92 --> 3827.88]  And then there was the
[3827.88 --> 3828.36]  whole thing with
[3828.36 --> 3829.86]  Michael Phelps where he
[3829.86 --> 3830.22]  didn't...
[3830.22 --> 3831.26]  He wasn't even tested
[3831.26 --> 3831.80]  positive.
[3832.14 --> 3832.32]  Yeah.
[3832.44 --> 3834.02]  He had a doobie in
[3834.02 --> 3836.08]  his hand at a party
[3836.08 --> 3837.66]  once and someone
[3837.66 --> 3838.48]  like shared that
[3838.48 --> 3838.86]  picture.
[3839.04 --> 3839.22]  Yeah.
[3839.98 --> 3842.02]  So anyway.
[3842.20 --> 3843.28]  Anyway it's good
[3843.28 --> 3844.14]  they're doing something.
[3844.36 --> 3845.56]  This is all in response
[3845.56 --> 3846.46]  to if you didn't catch
[3846.46 --> 3846.54]  it.
[3846.58 --> 3847.16]  We talked about this
[3847.16 --> 3848.10]  on WAN Show before
[3848.10 --> 3850.14]  but Corey Semphus
[3850.14 --> 3850.96]  Friesen's admission
[3850.96 --> 3852.44]  last month that the
[3852.44 --> 3853.38]  professional Counter-Strike
[3853.38 --> 3854.16]  Global Offensive player
[3854.16 --> 3855.64]  used Adderall during the
[3855.64 --> 3857.42]  ESL-1 Catalyst event in
[3857.42 --> 3857.92]  March.
[3858.40 --> 3859.22]  And the quote was...
[3859.22 --> 3860.12]  Which they knew of.
[3860.12 --> 3861.06]  We were all on
[3861.06 --> 3861.54]  Adderall.
[3861.70 --> 3862.58]  I don't even give an
[3862.58 --> 3862.96]  F.
[3863.06 --> 3864.16]  It was pretty obvious
[3864.16 --> 3865.00]  if you listen to the
[3865.00 --> 3865.96]  comms people can hate
[3865.96 --> 3866.58]  it or whatever.
[3867.30 --> 3868.40]  So testing positive
[3868.40 --> 3869.44]  could result in a range
[3869.44 --> 3870.30]  of punishments from
[3870.30 --> 3872.20]  reduced prize money and
[3872.20 --> 3873.30]  tournament points to
[3873.30 --> 3874.72]  disqualification and a
[3874.72 --> 3876.28]  maximum two-year ban
[3876.28 --> 3877.00]  from ESL events.
[3877.00 --> 3877.84]  That's actually scary.
[3877.96 --> 3878.68]  Reduced prize money
[3878.68 --> 3879.48]  like they're going to
[3879.48 --> 3880.00]  want to win.
[3880.94 --> 3881.48]  And if they take
[3881.48 --> 3882.30]  Adderall and do better
[3882.30 --> 3883.24]  and have reduced prize
[3883.24 --> 3883.92]  money they'll just
[3883.92 --> 3884.78]  probably win more money
[3884.78 --> 3885.04]  anyway.
[3885.16 --> 3885.74]  But a two-year
[3885.74 --> 3886.82]  suspension in pro gaming
[3886.82 --> 3887.60]  is basically a
[3887.60 --> 3888.44]  lifelong suspension.
[3888.44 --> 3888.86]  Yeah.
[3888.98 --> 3889.74]  The careers are
[3889.74 --> 3890.90]  phenomenally short.
[3891.00 --> 3892.24]  You have a very narrow
[3892.24 --> 3894.36]  window where you have
[3894.36 --> 3895.40]  to be really successful
[3895.40 --> 3896.40]  and then maybe you get
[3896.40 --> 3897.40]  a coaching job after.
[3898.40 --> 3899.08]  Because like you're
[3899.08 --> 3900.90]  still way better than
[3900.90 --> 3902.26]  humans but you're not
[3902.26 --> 3902.84]  good enough.
[3905.34 --> 3905.86]  Yeah.
[3905.86 --> 3908.18]  So you know the funny
[3908.18 --> 3909.56]  thing about this to me
[3909.56 --> 3913.92]  is that substance abuse.
[3914.30 --> 3914.40]  Okay.
[3914.54 --> 3916.22]  And this something like
[3916.22 --> 3917.60]  Adderall might not even
[3917.60 --> 3918.18]  be abuse.
[3918.32 --> 3919.64]  This is just testing
[3919.64 --> 3920.86]  positive for it.
[3921.14 --> 3921.52]  Period.
[3922.44 --> 3923.88]  That's a prescription
[3923.88 --> 3925.26]  medication potentially.
[3925.70 --> 3925.94]  I mean.
[3926.20 --> 3927.96]  I'm sure if you have a
[3927.96 --> 3929.06]  prescription for it.
[3929.46 --> 3930.16]  Not necessarily.
[3930.48 --> 3930.62]  No.
[3930.68 --> 3931.54]  There's lots of stuff
[3931.54 --> 3932.00]  like that.
[3932.16 --> 3932.78]  Like legitimate
[3932.78 --> 3934.08]  prescriptions at NBA or
[3934.08 --> 3934.38]  whatever.
[3934.60 --> 3935.48]  Like they test positive
[3935.48 --> 3935.88]  before it boom.
[3936.00 --> 3936.12]  No.
[3936.38 --> 3936.56]  Done.
[3936.98 --> 3937.18]  Done.
[3937.34 --> 3937.50]  Done.
[3937.74 --> 3938.10]  Suspension.
[3938.46 --> 3938.72]  Interesting.
[3939.50 --> 3940.32]  And the thing about
[3940.32 --> 3941.48]  this is like where do
[3941.48 --> 3942.38]  we draw the line?
[3942.80 --> 3944.26]  Is the line where
[3944.26 --> 3945.32]  you're competing for
[3945.32 --> 3945.58]  money?
[3946.34 --> 3947.26]  Because okay.
[3947.62 --> 3948.98]  Should I suspend Luke
[3948.98 --> 3950.24]  if I find out that
[3950.24 --> 3951.00]  he's been popping
[3951.00 --> 3952.14]  Ritalin before he comes
[3952.14 --> 3952.96]  into work so he can
[3952.96 --> 3953.56]  focus better?
[3955.64 --> 3956.52]  This isn't a
[3956.52 --> 3957.16]  competition.
[3958.00 --> 3959.22]  But isn't it?
[3960.04 --> 3961.52]  Isn't the workplace
[3961.52 --> 3962.16]  competitive?
[3962.86 --> 3964.10]  Are you not competing
[3964.10 --> 3965.12]  for promotions?
[3965.48 --> 3968.22]  For recognition from
[3968.22 --> 3969.06]  your boss or your
[3969.06 --> 3969.40]  peers?
[3969.80 --> 3970.96]  Which I never get
[3970.96 --> 3972.32]  anymore.
[3972.86 --> 3973.48]  Oh shit.
[3973.48 --> 3974.00]  I just want you
[3974.00 --> 3974.62]  to love me.
[3974.62 --> 3974.64]  Oh shit.
[3974.64 --> 3975.52]  Oh shit.
[3975.52 --> 3976.62]  And go back in your
[3976.62 --> 3977.64]  Harry Potter closet.
[3979.24 --> 3980.62]  But think about that
[3980.62 --> 3981.16]  for a second.
[3981.70 --> 3982.82]  Where do we draw the
[3982.82 --> 3983.28]  line now?
[3983.48 --> 3984.40]  You can't play video
[3984.40 --> 3984.74]  games.
[3984.84 --> 3986.28]  And I realize that I
[3986.28 --> 3987.28]  have made exactly the
[3987.28 --> 3987.92]  opposite argument
[3987.92 --> 3988.88]  previously on the show.
[3989.00 --> 3990.26]  This is as much a
[3990.26 --> 3992.54]  devil's advocate thing
[3992.54 --> 3993.42]  as anything else.
[3994.28 --> 3994.98]  That's what this whole
[3994.98 --> 3995.28]  show is.
[3995.28 --> 3996.32]  But where do we draw
[3996.32 --> 3996.96]  the line?
[3997.16 --> 3997.42]  Right.
[3997.54 --> 3998.52]  Are you not allowed
[3998.52 --> 4000.18]  to take Adderall?
[4000.82 --> 4001.42]  Like should we just
[4001.42 --> 4002.20]  ban the drug outright?
[4002.32 --> 4002.94]  No it makes people
[4002.94 --> 4003.64]  perform better.
[4003.72 --> 4004.28]  It's not fair.
[4005.04 --> 4006.52]  And honestly a lot
[4006.52 --> 4007.66]  of people that I know
[4007.66 --> 4009.64]  that are really good
[4009.64 --> 4010.50]  at video games.
[4011.86 --> 4012.86]  Whether or not it's
[4012.86 --> 4013.62]  true because there's
[4013.62 --> 4014.70]  some hubbub about that.
[4015.02 --> 4016.82]  But ADD or ADHD?
[4018.02 --> 4019.12]  A lot of people that
[4019.12 --> 4019.68]  I know that are really
[4019.68 --> 4020.28]  good at video games.
[4020.42 --> 4022.24]  So like you're going
[4022.24 --> 4023.06]  to be excluding a lot
[4023.06 --> 4023.90]  of people that would be
[4023.90 --> 4024.88]  prescribed for these
[4024.88 --> 4025.26]  drugs.
[4025.64 --> 4026.74]  And looking at the
[4026.74 --> 4029.32]  states what's prescription
[4029.32 --> 4030.12]  rates in the states
[4030.12 --> 4030.82]  for Adderall and
[4030.82 --> 4031.16]  Riddlewood?
[4031.26 --> 4032.42]  I don't remember.
[4032.68 --> 4032.70]  Isn't it just absurd?
[4032.70 --> 4033.44]  But it's something
[4033.44 --> 4033.90]  obscene.
[4033.90 --> 4034.08]  Yeah.
[4034.30 --> 4035.74]  I mean the thing about
[4035.74 --> 4038.30]  ADHD is that and I feel
[4038.30 --> 4039.32]  like I can talk about
[4039.32 --> 4040.20]  this fairly critically
[4040.20 --> 4043.76]  because I was an ADHD
[4043.76 --> 4044.32]  kid.
[4044.72 --> 4045.88]  I was on Ritalin
[4045.88 --> 4047.30]  very legitimately by
[4047.30 --> 4048.00]  the way I might add.
[4048.26 --> 4051.90]  But what is a
[4051.90 --> 4053.20]  legitimate prescription
[4053.20 --> 4054.00]  for Ritalin?
[4054.06 --> 4054.86]  Because you see a lot
[4054.86 --> 4056.44]  of kids getting Ritalin
[4056.44 --> 4056.88]  subscriptions.
[4058.20 --> 4058.96]  Ritalin prescriptions.
[4059.10 --> 4059.26]  Yeah.
[4059.52 --> 4060.10]  It's like.
[4060.58 --> 4061.40]  Sign up for it.
[4061.50 --> 4061.78]  Hold on.
[4061.78 --> 4062.40]  Dollar Shave Club
[4062.40 --> 4062.90]  isn't a sponsor.
[4063.02 --> 4063.14]  Yeah.
[4063.44 --> 4064.80]  Dollar Ritalin Club.
[4065.00 --> 4065.90]  We send you Ritalin
[4065.90 --> 4067.46]  once a month for a
[4067.46 --> 4068.22]  low monthly fee.
[4068.24 --> 4068.38]  You know what?
[4068.44 --> 4069.10]  If you had a
[4069.10 --> 4069.80]  prescription of that
[4069.80 --> 4070.58]  stuff and there was a
[4070.58 --> 4071.44]  service like Dollar
[4071.44 --> 4072.36]  Ritalin Club I'd be
[4072.36 --> 4072.88]  down with that.
[4072.88 --> 4074.00]  I would be down to
[4074.00 --> 4074.24]  get my.
[4074.24 --> 4074.78]  It's a good business
[4074.78 --> 4075.02]  model.
[4075.12 --> 4075.50]  They know what they're
[4075.50 --> 4075.72]  doing.
[4075.86 --> 4076.64]  I would be down to get
[4076.64 --> 4077.74]  my prescriptions delivered
[4077.74 --> 4079.10]  online if I didn't think
[4079.10 --> 4080.68]  that every company selling
[4080.68 --> 4081.72]  prescription medications
[4081.72 --> 4083.38]  online was only interested
[4083.38 --> 4084.72]  in selling me fake Viagra.
[4084.84 --> 4084.96]  Yeah.
[4085.62 --> 4086.40]  So no.
[4086.66 --> 4086.74]  Let's.
[4086.94 --> 4087.54]  So hold on.
[4087.66 --> 4087.80]  Right.
[4087.90 --> 4088.54]  So back to that.
[4088.62 --> 4089.70]  So the thing.
[4089.98 --> 4092.08]  The symptoms that get
[4092.08 --> 4093.30]  someone a Ritalin
[4093.30 --> 4093.76]  prescription.
[4093.88 --> 4094.70]  And I talk about Ritalin
[4094.70 --> 4095.56]  because that was the drug
[4095.56 --> 4096.90]  back in my day when I was
[4096.90 --> 4097.14]  on it.
[4097.20 --> 4098.26]  I think it's Adderall now.
[4098.40 --> 4098.66]  But whatever.
[4098.88 --> 4099.46]  Adderall Concerta.
[4099.46 --> 4101.06]  The thing that gets you a
[4101.06 --> 4102.90]  Ritalin prescription is
[4102.90 --> 4103.68]  being hyper.
[4104.66 --> 4105.96]  Which doesn't have to be a
[4105.96 --> 4106.52]  bad thing.
[4106.56 --> 4107.84]  So show me a red blooded
[4107.84 --> 4109.04]  eight year old that isn't
[4109.04 --> 4109.74]  a little hyper.
[4110.36 --> 4111.14]  And you know what?
[4111.20 --> 4112.82]  The reality of it is is my
[4112.82 --> 4113.56]  childhood was pretty
[4113.56 --> 4114.06]  complicated.
[4114.58 --> 4117.66]  And if I wasn't acting
[4117.66 --> 4119.02]  out, if I wasn't a little
[4119.02 --> 4120.52]  off the wall, then there
[4120.52 --> 4121.50]  was probably something even
[4121.50 --> 4122.54]  more wrong with me.
[4122.94 --> 4124.76]  So is a Ritalin
[4124.76 --> 4125.90]  prescription the answer or
[4125.90 --> 4126.84]  should we be finding the
[4126.84 --> 4127.90]  underlying issue a lot of
[4127.90 --> 4128.22]  the time?
[4128.84 --> 4130.14]  ADHD gets used as a
[4130.14 --> 4131.16]  catch-all diagnosis.
[4131.34 --> 4132.68]  It's kind of like...
[4132.68 --> 4133.82]  And sometimes it will be
[4133.82 --> 4134.56]  real, I'm sure.
[4134.90 --> 4135.28]  Yeah, absolutely.
[4135.28 --> 4136.28]  But it does get used as a
[4136.28 --> 4137.08]  catch-all a lot.
[4137.08 --> 4138.02]  And the thing that people
[4138.02 --> 4139.30]  have to understand too is
[4139.30 --> 4141.42]  that ADHD is a spectrum.
[4141.64 --> 4142.76]  It's like autism.
[4143.12 --> 4145.18]  You're not like 100%
[4145.18 --> 4147.14]  autistic or 0% autistic.
[4147.68 --> 4149.48]  Just like you're not 100%
[4149.48 --> 4151.24]  ADHD like all over the
[4151.24 --> 4151.42]  place.
[4151.48 --> 4152.14]  I have to do a thousand
[4152.14 --> 4152.92]  things right now.
[4153.00 --> 4154.26]  Or you just sit like a
[4154.26 --> 4154.90]  lump like this.
[4155.70 --> 4156.68]  It's a spectrum.
[4156.68 --> 4158.82]  So where is the line
[4158.82 --> 4159.20]  drawn?
[4159.32 --> 4160.18]  It's very complicated.
[4160.36 --> 4161.28]  And you look at something
[4161.28 --> 4162.76]  like autism where I believe
[4162.76 --> 4164.24]  Asperger's, which was kind
[4164.24 --> 4166.78]  of like mild autism spectrum,
[4166.78 --> 4169.60]  has actually been removed as
[4169.60 --> 4171.56]  an official diagnosis by at
[4171.56 --> 4171.88]  least...
[4171.88 --> 4172.76]  I think my mom was telling
[4172.76 --> 4173.36]  me there was some
[4173.36 --> 4174.30]  organization that has
[4174.30 --> 4175.82]  eliminated as a
[4175.82 --> 4176.80]  diagnosable condition.
[4177.16 --> 4178.68]  Because basically the
[4179.38 --> 4180.96]  symptom was being kind of
[4180.96 --> 4182.68]  like socially awkward
[4182.68 --> 4184.68]  awkward and like...
[4185.48 --> 4186.60]  So who isn't?
[4187.20 --> 4188.06]  Like who isn't a little
[4188.06 --> 4188.38]  hyper?
[4188.56 --> 4189.56]  Who isn't a little socially
[4189.56 --> 4189.92]  awkward?
[4190.38 --> 4191.88]  So it became sort of like
[4191.88 --> 4192.82]  what is...
[4192.82 --> 4194.04]  Like where's the line?
[4194.16 --> 4195.94]  If I'm not prepared for
[4195.94 --> 4197.16]  someone to recognize me or
[4197.16 --> 4198.32]  notice me, I'm the
[4198.32 --> 4199.26]  weirdest person ever.
[4199.48 --> 4201.42]  If I'm like totally not
[4201.42 --> 4202.18]  thinking about that
[4202.18 --> 4203.00]  possibility at all,
[4203.24 --> 4203.66]  someone's like,
[4203.76 --> 4204.00]  hi!
[4204.10 --> 4204.76]  And one's just like,
[4205.60 --> 4206.78]  hey.
[4207.68 --> 4208.68]  I've been really rude to
[4208.68 --> 4209.36]  people by accident.
[4211.46 --> 4212.40]  Just because I was like
[4212.40 --> 4214.58]  completely taken off guard.
[4215.44 --> 4216.12]  They were like,
[4216.28 --> 4216.80]  hey Linus,
[4216.86 --> 4217.62]  and I've gotten more
[4217.62 --> 4218.22]  used to it now.
[4218.30 --> 4218.68]  I'm just like,
[4218.78 --> 4219.06]  hey!
[4219.38 --> 4220.44]  The really awkward one
[4220.44 --> 4220.88]  for me though,
[4220.94 --> 4222.02]  sorry I'm totally going
[4222.02 --> 4222.54]  off on a tangent,
[4222.82 --> 4223.68]  is I'm pretty bad with
[4223.68 --> 4224.32]  names and faces.
[4224.98 --> 4226.64]  So it's when people are
[4226.64 --> 4227.66]  like, hey Linus,
[4227.80 --> 4228.46]  and I'm like,
[4228.58 --> 4228.78]  hey,
[4228.86 --> 4229.50]  and I just think they're
[4229.50 --> 4230.18]  a fan or whatever,
[4230.38 --> 4231.14]  but it's actually someone
[4231.14 --> 4231.44]  I know.
[4234.66 --> 4236.30]  That sounds like me.
[4236.30 --> 4237.62]  That's super,
[4237.82 --> 4238.92]  super awkward.
[4239.02 --> 4239.16]  Apparently there's two
[4239.16 --> 4239.96]  minutes left on the
[4239.96 --> 4240.18]  print.
[4241.04 --> 4241.44]  Oh wow,
[4241.50 --> 4241.68]  really?
[4241.82 --> 4242.38]  That's fun.
[4242.56 --> 4243.20]  I wish that power
[4243.20 --> 4243.94]  supply was working.
[4244.62 --> 4245.32]  Oh yeah!
[4245.62 --> 4246.22]  I'm going to play around
[4246.22 --> 4246.78]  with it a little bit
[4246.78 --> 4247.66]  after the show and see
[4247.66 --> 4248.30]  if I can figure out
[4248.30 --> 4248.76]  what's going on.
[4248.94 --> 4249.14]  Yeah.
[4251.64 --> 4252.88]  This is a pretty
[4252.88 --> 4253.98]  exciting topic though.
[4253.98 --> 4254.68]  This is from
[4254.68 --> 4256.72]  gosugamers.net,
[4256.88 --> 4259.50]  and this is going to be
[4259.50 --> 4260.80]  a definite opinion
[4260.80 --> 4262.24]  piece right here.
[4262.72 --> 4263.68]  Or piece of opinion,
[4263.90 --> 4265.18]  or I don't know what
[4265.18 --> 4266.06]  you want to call this,
[4266.06 --> 4267.50]  but we are straw pulling
[4267.50 --> 4268.70]  the crap out of this one.
[4272.36 --> 4273.66]  Esports in skill.
[4277.36 --> 4278.14]  All right.
[4279.22 --> 4280.76]  I think I got to give
[4280.76 --> 4281.78]  more than the usual
[4281.78 --> 4282.70]  options.
[4282.70 --> 4283.36]  So yes,
[4283.92 --> 4284.70]  gaming.
[4286.98 --> 4287.86]  So hold on,
[4288.00 --> 4289.74]  like practical gaming
[4289.74 --> 4291.66]  theory and,
[4291.74 --> 4293.96]  you know,
[4294.02 --> 4294.56]  like,
[4295.30 --> 4296.28]  I don't know.
[4298.58 --> 4298.98]  Okay.
[4299.10 --> 4299.26]  Okay.
[4302.14 --> 4303.10]  Yes,
[4303.64 --> 4304.70]  just theory.
[4305.00 --> 4305.34]  Yes,
[4305.50 --> 4306.50]  just practical
[4306.50 --> 4307.66]  gaming.
[4307.66 --> 4308.78]  So do you want to talk
[4308.78 --> 4309.36]  about this a little bit
[4309.36 --> 4309.82]  while I...
[4309.82 --> 4310.00]  Okay.
[4310.12 --> 4310.34]  Yeah.
[4310.50 --> 4311.70]  I don't think there's a ton
[4311.70 --> 4312.16]  to say.
[4312.30 --> 4312.66]  Basically,
[4312.82 --> 4314.78]  a few schools in Sweden,
[4315.58 --> 4318.20]  not like certain schools,
[4318.46 --> 4319.26]  not all of them,
[4319.58 --> 4320.60]  will be putting about
[4320.60 --> 4322.42]  three hours of esports
[4322.42 --> 4323.56]  class a week.
[4323.68 --> 4324.54]  So remembering how they
[4324.54 --> 4325.18]  do high school,
[4325.26 --> 4325.86]  I don't know if they do it
[4325.86 --> 4326.60]  this way in Sweden.
[4326.96 --> 4327.84]  You have blocks,
[4328.24 --> 4329.18]  so you might have like
[4329.18 --> 4330.74]  an hour long block
[4330.74 --> 4332.86]  three times in one week.
[4332.86 --> 4333.40]  It's like Monday,
[4333.50 --> 4333.66]  Wednesday,
[4333.78 --> 4334.46]  Friday or something.
[4335.46 --> 4336.28]  I'm assuming that's
[4336.28 --> 4336.96]  how it's going to work.
[4338.70 --> 4339.48]  Peoples will be able
[4339.48 --> 4340.36]  to practice and learn
[4340.36 --> 4341.60]  games such as Dota 2
[4341.60 --> 4342.56]  and Counter-Strike,
[4342.64 --> 4343.48]  just to name a few.
[4344.38 --> 4345.52]  None are supporting
[4345.52 --> 4347.00]  full-blown esports
[4347.00 --> 4348.04]  programs yet,
[4348.12 --> 4349.78]  but certain alignments
[4349.78 --> 4350.90]  can take classes in
[4350.90 --> 4351.20]  Dota,
[4351.36 --> 4351.88]  Counter-Strike,
[4351.98 --> 4353.18]  and esports in general.
[4353.28 --> 4353.66]  It's really funny
[4353.66 --> 4354.08]  that they're called
[4354.08 --> 4354.56]  alignments.
[4355.32 --> 4355.50]  Yeah.
[4357.34 --> 4357.68]  It's like,
[4357.86 --> 4360.16]  if you're a passive
[4360.16 --> 4360.64]  alignment,
[4360.88 --> 4361.74]  then you can take
[4361.74 --> 4362.60]  esports class,
[4362.60 --> 4363.36]  but no woodworking
[4363.36 --> 4363.88]  for you.
[4364.10 --> 4365.24]  That sounds a lot
[4365.24 --> 4365.94]  like video game
[4365.94 --> 4366.64]  high school where
[4366.64 --> 4367.18]  it was like,
[4367.30 --> 4368.72]  are you an RPG player
[4368.72 --> 4369.74]  and that's what
[4369.74 --> 4370.76]  class system you were
[4370.76 --> 4370.96]  in?
[4371.88 --> 4372.38]  So you could go
[4372.38 --> 4373.84]  with racing and
[4373.84 --> 4374.54]  then you took all
[4374.54 --> 4375.34]  the racing classes.
[4376.12 --> 4376.96]  That's what you were.
[4377.10 --> 4377.74]  You were a racing
[4377.74 --> 4378.10]  student.
[4378.28 --> 4379.14]  You didn't do the RPG
[4379.14 --> 4379.52]  stuff.
[4379.62 --> 4380.26]  You might in your own
[4380.26 --> 4381.52]  free time after class,
[4381.94 --> 4382.78]  but in class you're
[4382.78 --> 4383.60]  a racing student.
[4384.24 --> 4384.60]  So?
[4386.28 --> 4387.20]  They're treated as
[4387.20 --> 4387.86]  normal athletic
[4387.86 --> 4388.40]  subjects,
[4388.54 --> 4389.28]  access to rooms
[4389.28 --> 4390.08]  and areas designated
[4390.08 --> 4390.84]  for practice.
[4391.36 --> 4392.38]  School teams will
[4392.38 --> 4392.94]  be formed with
[4392.94 --> 4393.88]  the goal of competing
[4393.88 --> 4396.80]  at events.
[4397.84 --> 4398.82]  They're planning on
[4398.82 --> 4399.52]  bringing in players
[4399.52 --> 4400.16]  and personalities
[4400.16 --> 4401.00]  for guest lectures,
[4401.14 --> 4401.66]  which probably
[4401.66 --> 4402.32]  wouldn't be that
[4402.32 --> 4403.24]  hard to find in
[4403.24 --> 4403.48]  Sweden.
[4403.56 --> 4403.80]  Yeah.
[4403.80 --> 4404.26]  I'm completely
[4404.26 --> 4404.52]  honest.
[4404.52 --> 4405.06]  It's kind of a big
[4405.06 --> 4405.44]  deal there.
[4405.44 --> 4406.40]  they're really good
[4406.40 --> 4407.50]  at those things.
[4409.44 --> 4409.94]  At one school,
[4410.04 --> 4410.66]  students studying
[4410.66 --> 4411.82]  events will also
[4411.82 --> 4412.82]  get to host a large
[4412.82 --> 4413.88]  tournament as their
[4413.88 --> 4414.82]  third year final
[4414.82 --> 4415.46]  project.
[4415.66 --> 4416.02]  That's pretty
[4416.02 --> 4416.42]  interesting.
[4418.94 --> 4419.38]  Yeah.
[4419.62 --> 4420.26]  The school system
[4420.26 --> 4421.00]  must get better to,
[4421.28 --> 4421.78]  in general,
[4421.90 --> 4422.66]  in educating people
[4422.66 --> 4423.68]  about the contemporary
[4423.68 --> 4424.26]  society.
[4424.66 --> 4425.26]  And this is good
[4425.26 --> 4425.82]  evidence of that
[4425.82 --> 4426.30]  very fact.
[4426.58 --> 4427.00]  I think it's
[4427.00 --> 4427.78]  interesting that it's...
[4427.78 --> 4428.52]  So that was a quote.
[4428.52 --> 4429.24]  That's from
[4429.24 --> 4430.64]  Ibrahim Khalifa,
[4430.80 --> 4431.62]  chairman of education
[4431.62 --> 4432.34]  and employment
[4432.34 --> 4434.52]  in...
[4435.16 --> 4436.08]  Board in
[4436.08 --> 4436.98]  Sigtuna County.
[4437.34 --> 4437.52]  Yeah,
[4437.64 --> 4438.10]  Stockholm.
[4439.00 --> 4441.14]  And that's a good
[4441.14 --> 4441.54]  point,
[4441.58 --> 4442.02]  isn't it?
[4443.92 --> 4444.84]  We've got nobody
[4444.84 --> 4445.62]  voting on the straw
[4445.62 --> 4445.84]  poll.
[4445.96 --> 4446.10]  Oh,
[4446.16 --> 4446.40]  balls.
[4446.46 --> 4447.28]  I think I posted it
[4447.28 --> 4448.16]  in the wrong chat.
[4448.28 --> 4448.78]  I think I've had the
[4448.78 --> 4448.86]  wrong chat.
[4448.86 --> 4449.30]  Here's another
[4449.30 --> 4450.18]  pretty cool quote.
[4450.34 --> 4451.12]  There have been some
[4451.12 --> 4452.46]  frowning noses and
[4452.46 --> 4453.24]  some wondering why
[4453.24 --> 4453.74]  they get to play
[4453.74 --> 4454.54]  computer games during
[4454.54 --> 4455.26]  school hours.
[4455.60 --> 4456.38]  But we aim to kill
[4456.38 --> 4458.40]  the myth that it is...
[4458.40 --> 4459.28]  that it has to be a
[4459.28 --> 4459.88]  bad thing.
[4460.02 --> 4460.32]  Furthermore,
[4460.86 --> 4462.00]  it is about showing
[4462.00 --> 4463.20]  respect to this group
[4463.20 --> 4463.64]  of pupils.
[4463.94 --> 4464.12]  Now,
[4464.18 --> 4464.48]  there's some
[4464.48 --> 4465.28]  interesting things.
[4465.58 --> 4466.16]  Kids that aren't
[4466.16 --> 4466.60]  going to want to
[4466.60 --> 4467.58]  engage or straight up
[4467.58 --> 4468.42]  won't engage,
[4469.08 --> 4470.22]  at least positively,
[4470.48 --> 4471.40]  in gym class.
[4471.82 --> 4472.02]  Like,
[4472.54 --> 4474.52]  you can't expect
[4474.52 --> 4475.34]  every kid that goes
[4475.34 --> 4476.06]  to gym class to get
[4476.06 --> 4476.78]  on an NFL team.
[4477.14 --> 4477.34]  Yeah.
[4477.44 --> 4477.80]  And, like,
[4477.84 --> 4478.48]  we've all known
[4478.48 --> 4478.78]  that.
[4478.86 --> 4479.34]  But one of the
[4479.34 --> 4479.96]  reasons why people
[4479.96 --> 4480.56]  do it is because
[4480.56 --> 4481.20]  of team building
[4481.20 --> 4481.88]  exercises,
[4482.38 --> 4483.18]  physical fitness,
[4483.32 --> 4483.70]  all this other
[4483.70 --> 4484.18]  kind of stuff.
[4484.34 --> 4484.58]  Well,
[4485.76 --> 4486.58]  eSports classes
[4486.58 --> 4487.98]  could work very much
[4487.98 --> 4488.68]  in the team building
[4488.68 --> 4489.54]  exercises way.
[4489.92 --> 4490.68]  It could help these
[4490.68 --> 4491.70]  kids get in different
[4491.70 --> 4492.46]  social circles.
[4492.60 --> 4493.02]  If you're someone
[4493.02 --> 4494.04]  who's not necessarily
[4494.04 --> 4494.62]  going to do great
[4494.62 --> 4495.22]  in gym class,
[4495.56 --> 4496.26]  maybe this could be
[4496.26 --> 4496.90]  one of your avenues
[4496.90 --> 4497.68]  to build a team
[4497.68 --> 4498.22]  and make friends
[4498.22 --> 4498.66]  that way.
[4498.88 --> 4499.24]  Or,
[4499.44 --> 4499.84]  honestly,
[4500.02 --> 4500.50]  a lot of the
[4500.50 --> 4502.04]  really good players
[4502.04 --> 4502.66]  that I know
[4502.66 --> 4503.64]  are really physically
[4503.64 --> 4503.98]  fit,
[4504.08 --> 4504.86]  so maybe it's just
[4504.86 --> 4505.56]  another avenue.
[4505.98 --> 4507.08]  It can be very
[4507.08 --> 4508.18]  mentally stimulating,
[4508.18 --> 4509.00]  especially some of
[4509.00 --> 4509.50]  these hard games.
[4509.56 --> 4510.38]  You're very engaged
[4510.38 --> 4511.10]  the whole time.
[4512.84 --> 4513.38]  I don't think it's
[4513.38 --> 4514.00]  a terrible thing.
[4514.16 --> 4514.44]  I don't know,
[4514.48 --> 4515.26]  about three hours
[4515.26 --> 4515.66]  a week?
[4517.86 --> 4518.12]  Yeah,
[4518.20 --> 4519.00]  I'm really...
[4519.00 --> 4520.04]  In high school,
[4520.14 --> 4520.56]  you get to pick
[4520.56 --> 4520.98]  your courses,
[4521.12 --> 4521.32]  right?
[4521.76 --> 4523.06]  I'm really not sure
[4523.06 --> 4523.88]  how I would feel
[4523.88 --> 4524.74]  about my son
[4524.74 --> 4525.84]  coming home
[4525.84 --> 4526.44]  and being like,
[4526.66 --> 4526.84]  yeah,
[4526.90 --> 4527.76]  I enrolled in
[4527.76 --> 4529.00]  gaming level two.
[4529.46 --> 4529.70]  Well,
[4529.76 --> 4530.32]  in high school,
[4530.44 --> 4530.94]  you'd probably be
[4530.94 --> 4531.38]  a part of that
[4531.38 --> 4531.88]  conversation.
[4532.62 --> 4532.84]  Yeah,
[4532.92 --> 4533.42]  or like,
[4533.50 --> 4533.74]  okay,
[4533.86 --> 4534.06]  fine,
[4534.20 --> 4535.46]  here's my suggested
[4535.46 --> 4536.22]  course load
[4536.22 --> 4536.84]  that I'm taking.
[4537.36 --> 4537.98]  I'm going to take
[4537.98 --> 4538.50]  chemistry,
[4539.10 --> 4539.36]  Dota,
[4539.80 --> 4541.32]  and mathematics.
[4541.48 --> 4542.44]  If he had a spare.
[4542.44 --> 4543.54]  I mean,
[4543.64 --> 4545.02]  the thing for me
[4545.02 --> 4546.44]  is that...
[4547.60 --> 4548.84]  Honestly,
[4549.00 --> 4550.34]  I had a few spares
[4550.34 --> 4551.34]  because my school
[4551.34 --> 4551.98]  just didn't have
[4551.98 --> 4552.54]  anything better
[4552.54 --> 4553.14]  to offer me.
[4553.42 --> 4553.74]  So,
[4554.16 --> 4555.70]  here's my problem.
[4556.70 --> 4557.38]  If you're going
[4557.38 --> 4558.22]  to be like,
[4558.46 --> 4558.84]  on a...
[4558.84 --> 4558.98]  Like,
[4559.06 --> 4559.86]  I have no problem
[4559.86 --> 4561.00]  with a school Dota team.
[4561.92 --> 4562.32]  That,
[4562.44 --> 4563.26]  I don't object to.
[4563.26 --> 4563.52]  But you want it
[4563.52 --> 4564.20]  to be extracurricular?
[4564.26 --> 4564.92]  I think it should be
[4564.92 --> 4565.56]  extracurricular.
[4565.72 --> 4566.44]  I don't think it needs
[4566.44 --> 4567.26]  to be during class time.
[4567.70 --> 4568.56]  And the reason
[4568.56 --> 4569.58]  that PE...
[4569.58 --> 4570.12]  I think they should
[4570.12 --> 4572.08]  encourage school themes.
[4572.24 --> 4572.52]  Yes.
[4573.00 --> 4574.36]  No problem with that at all.
[4574.48 --> 4575.30]  I think that's great.
[4575.38 --> 4576.54]  I think being part
[4576.54 --> 4577.58]  of a school team
[4577.58 --> 4578.48]  and being part
[4578.48 --> 4579.82]  of your school's culture
[4579.82 --> 4580.58]  is really important
[4580.58 --> 4581.04]  and cool.
[4581.64 --> 4582.70]  But the reason
[4582.70 --> 4584.02]  that PE gets a pass
[4584.02 --> 4584.28]  from me,
[4584.30 --> 4585.34]  because PE was something
[4585.34 --> 4586.36]  that I stopped
[4586.36 --> 4587.12]  taking immediately
[4587.12 --> 4587.92]  when I didn't have
[4587.92 --> 4588.46]  to anymore.
[4589.22 --> 4590.38]  Not because I couldn't
[4590.38 --> 4591.16]  do it or whatever.
[4591.34 --> 4591.80]  I did too,
[4591.90 --> 4592.20]  to be honest.
[4592.24 --> 4592.74]  I just thought
[4592.74 --> 4593.36]  it was a waste
[4593.36 --> 4594.08]  of my time.
[4594.26 --> 4595.66]  I have to be in school
[4595.66 --> 4596.46]  during this time.
[4596.56 --> 4596.66]  Like,
[4596.72 --> 4597.66]  when I was in high school,
[4597.78 --> 4598.64]  I was one of those kids
[4598.64 --> 4599.26]  that didn't take
[4599.26 --> 4599.76]  a free block.
[4600.30 --> 4601.36]  I took no free block.
[4601.50 --> 4602.34]  I took no PE.
[4602.74 --> 4604.16]  I took all of my sciences,
[4604.34 --> 4605.24]  even though you only
[4605.24 --> 4605.92]  had to take,
[4605.98 --> 4606.22]  I think,
[4606.26 --> 4607.58]  one or something
[4607.58 --> 4608.60]  to graduate.
[4608.78 --> 4609.96]  One grade 12 level science.
[4610.04 --> 4610.68]  Or did you even need
[4610.68 --> 4611.10]  any 12 level?
[4611.10 --> 4611.26]  You didn't need
[4611.26 --> 4612.12]  a grade 12 level science.
[4612.22 --> 4614.38]  So I did all
[4614.38 --> 4615.72]  my grade 12 level sciences.
[4615.72 --> 4616.16]  I think you needed
[4616.16 --> 4617.32]  10 or 11 or something.
[4617.68 --> 4618.78]  And stuff like that,
[4618.82 --> 4620.24]  because I'm in school
[4620.24 --> 4620.78]  to learn.
[4621.32 --> 4622.24]  And video games
[4622.24 --> 4622.92]  are not learning.
[4623.42 --> 4624.24]  And quite frankly,
[4624.34 --> 4625.02]  throwing a basketball
[4625.02 --> 4625.42]  at a hoop
[4625.42 --> 4626.66]  is not learning either.
[4626.84 --> 4627.72]  Unless you're serious
[4627.72 --> 4628.16]  about it,
[4628.18 --> 4628.96]  in which case,
[4629.26 --> 4630.24]  you're on the team
[4630.24 --> 4631.42]  and you're attending
[4631.42 --> 4632.50]  practices before
[4632.50 --> 4633.42]  or after school
[4633.42 --> 4634.16]  and it's a serious
[4634.16 --> 4634.78]  part of your life.
[4634.84 --> 4634.94]  Like,
[4635.04 --> 4636.84]  it's secondary.
[4637.40 --> 4638.18]  School is learning
[4638.18 --> 4639.80]  and PE,
[4640.02 --> 4640.72]  the reason that
[4640.72 --> 4641.76]  I give it a pass
[4641.76 --> 4642.70]  for existing at all
[4642.70 --> 4644.26]  is that the rationale
[4644.26 --> 4645.32]  behind it,
[4645.74 --> 4646.40]  whether it works
[4646.40 --> 4646.92]  or not,
[4646.92 --> 4648.26]  is very much
[4648.26 --> 4648.98]  an open discussion
[4648.98 --> 4649.40]  and not one
[4649.40 --> 4649.70]  that I'm going
[4649.70 --> 4650.28]  to get into now.
[4650.34 --> 4650.86]  But the rationale
[4650.86 --> 4651.52]  behind it
[4651.52 --> 4652.52]  is that it's about
[4652.52 --> 4653.64]  getting into the habit
[4653.64 --> 4654.96]  of doing some exercise
[4654.96 --> 4655.40]  daily,
[4655.40 --> 4656.64]  which is a good
[4656.64 --> 4658.02]  lifelong habit
[4658.02 --> 4658.74]  to have.
[4659.32 --> 4660.10]  And getting kids
[4660.10 --> 4661.14]  used to that idea,
[4661.48 --> 4661.90]  especially,
[4662.72 --> 4663.06]  I mean,
[4663.14 --> 4663.44]  I don't know
[4663.44 --> 4664.20]  what the culture's like.
[4664.20 --> 4664.94]  After going to university,
[4665.20 --> 4666.04]  that doesn't work.
[4667.52 --> 4668.00]  So,
[4668.14 --> 4668.50]  I don't know
[4668.50 --> 4669.28]  what the culture's like
[4669.28 --> 4669.94]  in Sweden,
[4670.28 --> 4671.36]  but here,
[4672.00 --> 4673.92]  even for very little kids,
[4674.34 --> 4675.04]  PE might be
[4675.04 --> 4676.22]  the only exercise
[4676.22 --> 4677.16]  these kids are getting
[4677.16 --> 4678.34]  on a given day.
[4678.72 --> 4679.54]  And having it exist
[4679.54 --> 4680.02]  at all,
[4680.08 --> 4682.16]  if that does anything,
[4682.16 --> 4685.46]  if it does nothing else,
[4686.16 --> 4688.06]  it reduces the barrier
[4688.06 --> 4688.92]  to entry
[4688.92 --> 4691.38]  for learning a sport.
[4692.26 --> 4692.94]  And I'll explain
[4692.94 --> 4693.74]  what that means.
[4693.96 --> 4694.04]  Like,
[4694.68 --> 4695.12]  badminton,
[4695.42 --> 4696.84]  I think one of the big things
[4696.84 --> 4697.42]  holding it back,
[4697.48 --> 4698.32]  I love badminton,
[4698.40 --> 4699.36]  I play badminton all the time,
[4699.62 --> 4700.44]  one of the big things
[4700.44 --> 4701.38]  holding badminton back
[4701.38 --> 4703.38]  is it is damn near impossible
[4703.38 --> 4704.32]  to pick it up.
[4704.86 --> 4705.34]  Because,
[4705.52 --> 4706.32]  where do you play?
[4706.86 --> 4707.06]  Well,
[4707.10 --> 4707.96]  it's kind of fragmented.
[4708.18 --> 4709.44]  There's like badminton centers,
[4709.70 --> 4710.82]  but the only way
[4710.82 --> 4711.46]  to play there
[4711.46 --> 4712.68]  is to either go play
[4712.68 --> 4713.36]  drop-in
[4713.36 --> 4715.08]  with like all these people
[4715.08 --> 4716.62]  of varied skill levels,
[4716.88 --> 4717.96]  most of which show up
[4717.96 --> 4718.72]  with a clique of friends
[4718.72 --> 4719.74]  to play drop-in together,
[4719.88 --> 4720.50]  so there's almost
[4720.50 --> 4722.04]  no one to play with.
[4722.20 --> 4723.46]  If you're not very good,
[4723.70 --> 4724.44]  no one's going to want
[4724.44 --> 4724.92]  to play with you.
[4724.98 --> 4725.78]  People will actively
[4725.78 --> 4726.60]  avoid you.
[4727.12 --> 4727.34]  Okay?
[4727.72 --> 4728.58]  So the alternative
[4728.58 --> 4730.08]  is you can go try
[4730.08 --> 4731.12]  and find like the,
[4731.16 --> 4731.72]  like the,
[4731.72 --> 4732.64]  the rogue groups,
[4732.80 --> 4732.98]  the,
[4733.38 --> 4734.30]  the...
[4734.30 --> 4735.16]  Leave it alone,
[4735.28 --> 4735.84]  you crying!
[4737.32 --> 4738.02]  Someone's touching
[4738.02 --> 4738.88]  his 3D print apparently.
[4739.22 --> 4740.34]  So there'll be like,
[4740.40 --> 4741.08]  like small,
[4741.08 --> 4742.52]  small private leagues
[4742.52 --> 4743.78]  or like private facilities
[4743.78 --> 4744.18]  or whatever,
[4744.28 --> 4745.26]  so you can play at those.
[4745.50 --> 4745.86]  Again,
[4745.96 --> 4746.54]  no one's going to want
[4746.54 --> 4747.02]  to play with you
[4747.02 --> 4747.60]  if you suck,
[4748.22 --> 4749.66]  which leaves nothing.
[4749.82 --> 4750.52]  You can like,
[4751.08 --> 4751.66]  hit to yourself
[4751.66 --> 4752.38]  in your backyard,
[4752.78 --> 4753.24]  which is,
[4753.30 --> 4754.54]  which is sort of horrible.
[4755.30 --> 4757.00]  So unless you're any good,
[4757.10 --> 4757.84]  it's not like bowling,
[4757.94 --> 4758.50]  where you can just go
[4758.50 --> 4759.50]  practice by yourself.
[4760.58 --> 4761.56]  It's going to be hard
[4761.56 --> 4762.72]  to become part
[4762.72 --> 4763.18]  of that,
[4763.30 --> 4764.74]  that social experience
[4764.74 --> 4765.12]  of,
[4765.16 --> 4766.02]  of playing with people
[4766.02 --> 4766.32]  and,
[4766.32 --> 4766.80]  and learning
[4766.80 --> 4767.34]  and all that,
[4767.42 --> 4768.16]  and all that kind of stuff.
[4768.16 --> 4768.98]  So I think that
[4768.98 --> 4770.32]  PE class
[4770.32 --> 4771.28]  builds skills
[4771.28 --> 4772.24]  that make it even
[4772.24 --> 4773.62]  possible to go
[4773.62 --> 4774.48]  and engage.
[4774.54 --> 4774.66]  I mean,
[4774.80 --> 4775.40]  can you imagine
[4775.40 --> 4775.80]  if you,
[4775.88 --> 4776.72]  if you show up
[4776.72 --> 4777.18]  at,
[4777.64 --> 4778.04]  you know,
[4778.24 --> 4780.34]  the local basketball court,
[4780.56 --> 4780.82]  you know,
[4780.86 --> 4781.64]  just at the park
[4781.64 --> 4782.08]  or whatever,
[4782.48 --> 4783.40]  and you totally suck.
[4783.56 --> 4784.08]  No one's going
[4784.08 --> 4784.80]  to want you to play.
[4785.24 --> 4785.48]  You know,
[4785.52 --> 4786.40]  you'd be always last
[4786.40 --> 4786.86]  to be picked
[4786.86 --> 4787.58]  and in some cases
[4787.58 --> 4788.46]  never picked at all.
[4788.56 --> 4789.18]  So you'd just lean up
[4789.18 --> 4789.68]  on the wall
[4789.68 --> 4791.04]  or sit up in the bleachers
[4791.04 --> 4791.68]  with the rest of the,
[4791.78 --> 4792.22]  sorry.
[4793.02 --> 4793.78]  That was awesome.
[4794.26 --> 4795.22]  I'm so happy
[4795.22 --> 4796.22]  I came back for that.
[4796.98 --> 4798.86]  So that to me
[4798.86 --> 4799.80]  is the justification
[4799.80 --> 4800.54]  for PE
[4800.54 --> 4801.20]  because you are
[4801.20 --> 4803.00]  legitimately learning
[4803.00 --> 4804.32]  how to engage
[4804.32 --> 4805.16]  in these activities.
[4805.68 --> 4807.54]  And PE will cover things
[4807.54 --> 4808.90]  like how to throw a ball
[4808.90 --> 4810.12]  because it's one thing
[4810.12 --> 4811.04]  if you show up
[4811.04 --> 4812.12]  for like a beer league
[4812.12 --> 4812.98]  baseball team
[4812.98 --> 4814.56]  and you can throw a ball
[4814.56 --> 4815.60]  and like swing a bat
[4815.60 --> 4816.16]  but you're kind of
[4816.16 --> 4816.88]  not very good
[4816.88 --> 4818.30]  versus if you show up
[4818.30 --> 4818.86]  and you like throw
[4818.86 --> 4819.84]  something like this.
[4820.34 --> 4820.88]  People are just going
[4820.88 --> 4821.16]  to be like,
[4821.16 --> 4821.92]  oh my god,
[4822.18 --> 4822.88]  no one's going
[4822.88 --> 4823.70]  to want to play with you.
[4824.44 --> 4826.36]  So there you go.
[4826.66 --> 4827.98]  And I don't think
[4827.98 --> 4829.46]  that esports
[4829.46 --> 4830.38]  has that issue.
[4830.48 --> 4831.26]  I think it's easy
[4831.26 --> 4832.42]  to practice on your own
[4832.42 --> 4833.80]  at home
[4833.80 --> 4835.42]  outside of school hours.
[4836.18 --> 4837.04]  And it's also,
[4837.44 --> 4837.64]  you know,
[4837.68 --> 4838.44]  let's be honest
[4838.44 --> 4839.10]  with ourselves,
[4839.34 --> 4841.48]  it's very much
[4841.48 --> 4842.86]  pure enjoyment
[4842.86 --> 4844.34]  for the vast majority
[4844.34 --> 4844.74]  of people
[4844.74 --> 4845.42]  who are doing it.
[4845.64 --> 4846.76]  The only people
[4846.76 --> 4847.56]  who are really
[4847.56 --> 4848.70]  working at it
[4848.70 --> 4850.06]  are the competitive people.
[4850.06 --> 4852.66]  So what's the benefit
[4852.66 --> 4853.54]  for the people
[4853.54 --> 4854.38]  who aren't competitive?
[4855.06 --> 4856.10]  Is this a system
[4856.10 --> 4857.00]  that is going to be
[4857.00 --> 4857.60]  put in place
[4857.60 --> 4858.70]  and simply abused?
[4858.82 --> 4859.46]  I don't know.
[4859.90 --> 4860.84]  I can also see
[4860.84 --> 4861.38]  like if it was
[4861.38 --> 4862.66]  a purely theory-based
[4862.66 --> 4863.50]  and no one agrees
[4863.50 --> 4863.88]  with me,
[4864.02 --> 4865.48]  5% said yes,
[4865.58 --> 4866.04]  just theory.
[4866.34 --> 4866.84]  Like if it was
[4866.84 --> 4867.96]  a purely theory-based
[4867.96 --> 4868.20]  thing,
[4868.28 --> 4868.84]  like you're looking
[4868.84 --> 4870.82]  at how leagues work,
[4870.90 --> 4871.16]  you're looking
[4871.16 --> 4871.72]  at the history
[4871.72 --> 4872.24]  of gaming,
[4872.40 --> 4873.08]  you're looking at,
[4873.32 --> 4873.84]  like if we were
[4873.84 --> 4874.40]  going to tackle
[4874.40 --> 4875.74]  esports more from
[4875.74 --> 4877.42]  a purely educational
[4877.42 --> 4877.96]  perspective,
[4878.08 --> 4878.42]  then great.
[4878.60 --> 4879.84]  But I don't,
[4880.18 --> 4881.00]  here's another thing,
[4881.30 --> 4882.06]  3 hours a week
[4882.06 --> 4883.52]  is nothing for gaming.
[4883.88 --> 4884.40]  Like if you're like,
[4884.46 --> 4885.10]  yeah, I'm going to get
[4885.10 --> 4886.48]  great at Starcraft 2,
[4886.54 --> 4887.06]  I'm going to practice
[4887.06 --> 4887.80]  for 3 hours.
[4888.36 --> 4888.74]  Like what,
[4888.80 --> 4889.26]  you've done your
[4889.26 --> 4890.24]  tutorial campaign
[4890.24 --> 4891.06]  in the first week
[4891.06 --> 4891.58]  of classes?
[4892.74 --> 4893.96]  Like that's really,
[4893.96 --> 4894.96]  that's really silly.
[4895.90 --> 4897.04]  Like gaming is not
[4897.04 --> 4898.90]  designed for
[4898.90 --> 4900.06]  learning it
[4900.06 --> 4901.32]  in 3 hours a week.
[4901.70 --> 4902.32]  It's designed
[4902.32 --> 4903.14]  to have people
[4903.14 --> 4903.70]  sit down
[4903.70 --> 4905.32]  and do it
[4905.32 --> 4905.98]  repetitively
[4905.98 --> 4906.78]  until they master it.
[4906.80 --> 4907.28]  Which is again
[4907.28 --> 4908.02]  one of the criticisms
[4908.02 --> 4908.98]  of PE,
[4909.14 --> 4909.80]  of gym class.
[4910.02 --> 4910.62]  Is that you're
[4910.62 --> 4911.14]  never going to get
[4911.14 --> 4911.94]  great at football
[4911.94 --> 4912.84]  by doing your
[4912.84 --> 4914.14]  one week football
[4914.14 --> 4914.78]  unit in PE.
[4914.78 --> 4915.32]  When I was playing
[4915.32 --> 4916.08]  football it was
[4916.08 --> 4916.68]  3,
[4917.60 --> 4918.92]  4 practices a week
[4918.92 --> 4919.58]  and a game.
[4920.94 --> 4921.40]  So like,
[4922.58 --> 4922.96]  yeah,
[4923.14 --> 4923.98]  like we were pretty good
[4923.98 --> 4925.72]  but 4 practices a week
[4925.72 --> 4926.32]  at like I think
[4926.32 --> 4927.30]  an hour and a half each
[4927.30 --> 4928.98]  and a game.
[4929.72 --> 4930.56]  That's a lot.
[4933.70 --> 4935.00]  So I personally
[4935.00 --> 4935.86]  don't think people
[4935.86 --> 4936.36]  should be playing
[4936.36 --> 4937.28]  video games in class.
[4938.82 --> 4939.50]  I don't think it
[4939.50 --> 4940.16]  makes a ton of sense
[4940.16 --> 4940.64]  objectively.
[4942.26 --> 4943.12]  So there you go.
[4946.06 --> 4946.84]  What else do we
[4946.84 --> 4947.32]  got here?
[4949.40 --> 4949.76]  Oh,
[4949.82 --> 4950.12]  this is,
[4950.26 --> 4951.36]  original article here
[4951.36 --> 4952.00]  is Kotaku
[4952.00 --> 4953.22]  and this is by
[4953.22 --> 4954.96]  Ramam Metaz
[4954.96 --> 4955.86]  posted on the forum.
[4956.50 --> 4957.54]  Nintendo fired an
[4957.54 --> 4958.42]  employee for speaking
[4958.42 --> 4959.18]  out on a podcast.
[4961.24 --> 4962.08]  A lot of debate
[4962.08 --> 4962.74]  about this
[4962.74 --> 4964.54]  but the reality
[4964.54 --> 4965.16]  of it is
[4965.16 --> 4966.04]  whether it was
[4966.04 --> 4967.58]  heartless or not
[4967.58 --> 4970.14]  it's extraordinarily
[4970.14 --> 4970.64]  likely,
[4970.80 --> 4971.32]  especially given
[4971.32 --> 4972.36]  the secretive culture
[4972.36 --> 4972.86]  at Nintendo
[4972.86 --> 4973.52]  that this was
[4973.52 --> 4974.24]  in his employee
[4974.24 --> 4974.66]  agreement
[4974.66 --> 4975.68]  that he was not
[4975.68 --> 4976.38]  to talk publicly
[4976.38 --> 4977.46]  about company
[4977.46 --> 4978.18]  projects
[4978.18 --> 4978.86]  and he gave
[4978.86 --> 4979.84]  a lot of opinions
[4979.84 --> 4980.58]  not all of them
[4980.58 --> 4981.50]  positive about
[4981.50 --> 4982.42]  you know,
[4982.56 --> 4982.96]  policies
[4982.96 --> 4984.60]  and yeah,
[4984.66 --> 4985.04]  basically
[4985.04 --> 4987.24]  last week
[4987.24 --> 4987.72]  he went on the
[4987.72 --> 4988.06]  podcast
[4988.06 --> 4988.88]  said some things
[4988.88 --> 4989.54]  he shouldn't have
[4989.54 --> 4990.18]  this week
[4990.18 --> 4991.20]  Nintendo fired him.
[4992.08 --> 4993.66]  I hope that we
[4993.66 --> 4994.66]  never get corporate
[4994.66 --> 4995.62]  enough around here
[4995.62 --> 4997.26]  to have
[4997.26 --> 4999.38]  to have something
[4999.38 --> 5000.48]  like that happen.
[5000.66 --> 5001.24]  I've seen a lot
[5001.24 --> 5001.78]  of people saying
[5001.78 --> 5002.06]  well,
[5002.14 --> 5002.64]  he should have been
[5002.64 --> 5003.16]  given a warning
[5003.16 --> 5004.52]  first or whatever
[5004.52 --> 5005.34]  else but you know
[5005.34 --> 5005.48]  what?
[5005.66 --> 5005.90]  He was pretty brutal.
[5006.48 --> 5007.94]  This was the warning
[5007.94 --> 5009.98]  but the warning
[5009.98 --> 5010.98]  was for everyone else
[5010.98 --> 5014.12]  and if you are
[5014.12 --> 5015.02]  going and you see
[5015.02 --> 5015.86]  the thing to understand
[5015.86 --> 5016.58]  too about Nintendo
[5016.58 --> 5017.90]  is that they have
[5017.90 --> 5018.94]  a culture that's
[5018.94 --> 5020.02]  very secretive.
[5020.02 --> 5021.14]  nothing leaks
[5021.14 --> 5021.80]  from Nintendo.
[5022.40 --> 5022.82]  Why?
[5023.40 --> 5024.50]  Because when it happens
[5024.50 --> 5025.68]  they make an example
[5025.68 --> 5026.20]  out of them
[5026.20 --> 5027.54]  and if people
[5027.54 --> 5028.20]  get a warning
[5028.20 --> 5028.94]  everyone's
[5028.94 --> 5029.96]  if one person
[5029.96 --> 5030.96]  gets one warning
[5030.96 --> 5031.72]  everyone's going to
[5031.72 --> 5032.26]  feel like they
[5032.26 --> 5033.02]  have a freebie too.
[5034.66 --> 5035.14]  So,
[5035.64 --> 5037.18]  I get it.
[5038.50 --> 5039.62]  Super sucky
[5039.62 --> 5040.84]  and his Facebook
[5040.84 --> 5041.58]  comment is
[5041.58 --> 5042.22]  absolutely
[5042.22 --> 5043.46]  heartbreaking.
[5044.24 --> 5044.46]  You know,
[5044.56 --> 5045.20]  like I look around
[5045.20 --> 5045.64]  my house
[5045.64 --> 5046.24]  I see images
[5046.24 --> 5046.80]  of my son
[5046.80 --> 5047.30]  and I feel
[5047.30 --> 5048.08]  intense shame
[5048.08 --> 5048.56]  and crippling
[5048.56 --> 5048.98]  sadness.
[5048.98 --> 5049.92]  I know that
[5049.92 --> 5050.38]  if I can't
[5050.38 --> 5050.84]  find a job
[5050.84 --> 5051.42]  at least as good
[5051.42 --> 5051.86]  as this one
[5051.86 --> 5052.36]  I won't be able
[5052.36 --> 5052.74]  to provide
[5052.74 --> 5053.42]  for my family.
[5055.12 --> 5055.84]  I've lost them
[5055.84 --> 5056.48]  their health coverage
[5056.48 --> 5057.12]  and their security.
[5057.50 --> 5057.88]  I also know
[5057.88 --> 5058.32]  that I've probably
[5058.32 --> 5058.94]  lost a good deal
[5058.94 --> 5059.52]  of my friends
[5059.52 --> 5060.22]  just because I know
[5060.22 --> 5061.02]  how hard it can be
[5061.02 --> 5061.54]  to stay in touch
[5061.54 --> 5062.02]  with someone
[5062.02 --> 5063.12]  when the convenience
[5063.12 --> 5063.82]  of proximity
[5063.82 --> 5064.40]  is lost.
[5064.50 --> 5064.98]  I'm so sorry
[5064.98 --> 5065.48]  to everyone.
[5065.58 --> 5066.08]  I failed you.
[5066.18 --> 5066.74]  You believed in me
[5066.74 --> 5067.28]  and supported me
[5067.28 --> 5067.86]  and trusted me
[5067.86 --> 5068.82]  and I failed you.
[5068.96 --> 5069.64]  I failed me
[5069.64 --> 5070.76]  and that's
[5070.76 --> 5072.46]  that is some
[5072.46 --> 5073.84]  powerful stuff
[5073.84 --> 5074.36]  right there
[5074.36 --> 5075.94]  and super
[5075.94 --> 5077.28]  super sucky
[5077.28 --> 5078.52]  but the thing
[5078.52 --> 5078.96]  that you
[5078.96 --> 5079.46]  so let
[5079.46 --> 5080.30]  let this be
[5080.30 --> 5081.52]  let it not be
[5081.52 --> 5082.00]  for nothing.
[5082.94 --> 5083.38]  Let this be
[5083.38 --> 5084.32]  a warning to you.
[5085.02 --> 5085.62]  Read your
[5085.62 --> 5086.84]  employee agreement
[5086.84 --> 5087.64]  carefully.
[5089.08 --> 5090.46]  Don't talk about
[5090.46 --> 5091.82]  private stuff
[5091.82 --> 5093.14]  to anyone
[5093.14 --> 5093.94]  who is not
[5093.94 --> 5094.62]  internal and
[5094.62 --> 5095.00]  authorized
[5095.00 --> 5096.80]  because that is
[5096.80 --> 5098.06]  some sucky stuff
[5098.06 --> 5098.46]  right there.
[5099.14 --> 5100.00]  One more topic?
[5100.00 --> 5101.76]  They're all
[5101.76 --> 5102.38]  screwing with
[5102.38 --> 5102.68]  the printer
[5102.68 --> 5103.20]  so I'm a little
[5103.20 --> 5103.70]  pissed off
[5103.70 --> 5104.30]  but we can do
[5104.30 --> 5104.98]  one more topic.
[5105.58 --> 5105.98]  Okay.
[5106.42 --> 5107.34]  This is so annoying
[5107.34 --> 5108.18]  because if they
[5108.18 --> 5108.74]  screw anything up
[5108.74 --> 5109.14]  now I'm just
[5109.14 --> 5109.46]  going to have to
[5109.46 --> 5109.90]  spend hours
[5109.90 --> 5110.88]  fixing it
[5110.88 --> 5112.20]  but they think
[5112.20 --> 5112.56]  it's funny
[5112.56 --> 5113.24]  so that's okay.
[5113.56 --> 5114.28]  Steamboy or
[5114.28 --> 5115.02]  Smash Zero
[5115.02 --> 5115.66]  is a portable
[5115.66 --> 5116.22]  handheld
[5116.22 --> 5117.00]  steam machine.
[5117.52 --> 5117.90]  So it's going
[5117.90 --> 5118.36]  to be powered
[5118.36 --> 5119.58]  by 4 gigs of RAM
[5119.58 --> 5120.40]  32 gigs of
[5120.40 --> 5121.02]  internal storage
[5121.02 --> 5122.34]  a 720p touchscreen
[5122.34 --> 5123.60]  and an HDMI
[5123.60 --> 5124.28]  output.
[5124.56 --> 5125.10]  It will carry
[5125.10 --> 5125.58]  an AMD
[5125.58 --> 5126.76]  embedded G-series
[5126.76 --> 5127.52]  SoC
[5127.52 --> 5128.98]  with a Jaguar
[5128.98 --> 5129.78]  based CPU
[5129.78 --> 5130.66]  and GCN
[5130.66 --> 5131.56]  based Radeon
[5131.56 --> 5132.42]  graphics.
[5133.02 --> 5134.00]  Basically I think
[5134.00 --> 5134.54]  this thing is
[5134.54 --> 5135.52]  probably a boatload
[5135.52 --> 5136.14]  of fail at
[5136.14 --> 5136.64]  $300
[5136.64 --> 5138.70]  but
[5138.70 --> 5140.70]  there's naturally
[5140.70 --> 5141.18]  going to be
[5141.18 --> 5142.02]  tons of games
[5142.02 --> 5142.58]  in your library
[5142.58 --> 5143.06]  that won't be
[5143.06 --> 5143.62]  compatible with
[5143.62 --> 5144.14]  Smash Zero
[5144.14 --> 5144.68]  on Steam
[5144.68 --> 5145.32]  duh
[5145.32 --> 5146.32]  but it will
[5146.32 --> 5147.46]  according to
[5147.46 --> 5147.82]  the promotional
[5147.82 --> 5148.46]  video play
[5148.46 --> 5149.84]  1,000 plus
[5149.84 --> 5150.44]  games.
[5151.48 --> 5152.16]  There's so many
[5152.16 --> 5152.36]  of those
[5152.36 --> 5152.64]  are going to be
[5152.64 --> 5153.06]  trash.
[5153.30 --> 5153.56]  Yeah.
[5153.74 --> 5154.52]  So many of those
[5154.52 --> 5154.78]  are going to be
[5154.78 --> 5155.04]  trash.
[5155.18 --> 5155.32]  Yeah.
[5155.80 --> 5156.62]  It's not about
[5156.62 --> 5157.38]  the volume of
[5157.38 --> 5158.52]  games at all.
[5158.66 --> 5158.88]  No.
[5159.26 --> 5160.60]  So on that
[5160.60 --> 5160.92]  note
[5160.92 --> 5162.32]  thank you guys
[5162.32 --> 5162.88]  for watching
[5162.88 --> 5163.64]  we will see you
[5163.64 --> 5164.92]  again next week
[5164.92 --> 5165.78]  same bat time
[5165.78 --> 5167.14]  same bat channel.
[5167.42 --> 5167.70]  Yay.
[5168.46 --> 5169.00]  It's funny
[5169.00 --> 5169.74]  they always ask
[5169.74 --> 5170.10]  if we're going to
[5170.10 --> 5170.52]  be on time
[5170.52 --> 5170.94]  this week
[5170.94 --> 5171.54]  but at the end
[5171.54 --> 5172.12]  of every show
[5172.12 --> 5173.26]  I say same bat
[5173.26 --> 5173.88]  time.
[5177.60 --> 5178.44]  So no?
[5179.46 --> 5180.16]  Oh it didn't
[5180.16 --> 5180.32]  work.
[5180.36 --> 5181.10]  I told you
[5181.10 --> 5181.84]  it wouldn't work.
[5184.90 --> 5185.56]  There it worked.
[5185.80 --> 5186.16]  Yay.
[5186.62 --> 5191.68]  there.
[5195.08 --> 5195.80]  All right.
[5198.80 --> 5200.12]  So
[5200.12 --> 5200.32]  and
[5200.32 --> 5201.12]  there
[5201.12 --> 5202.20]  you
[5202.20 --> 5232.18]  Thank you.
