[0.00 → 10.20] all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to the wan show the show on the internet that's why we
[10.20 → 15.32] called it wan show I started trying to come up with a different name for it that was like the
[15.32 → 21.06] offline show and I was like nope technically it's online it's online it says it's my line is
[21.06 → 27.82] on your line is on slow when you could touch our lines together if you want we could well I okay
[27.82 → 32.96] I've heard I've heard a conspiracy theory from the same guy who did the jar banks is a Sith master
[32.96 → 39.18] conspiracy theory that actually we called it wan show because we chickened out on calling it the
[39.18 → 44.52] weekly analysis news and gaming show the same guy no you made that up I was really excited because
[44.52 → 50.12] that guy's like famous yeah no he's he's about as internet famous as like anyone who works here i
[50.12 → 55.52] think yeah like I don't know anyone who hasn't read that read it I thought that would have been super
[55.52 → 59.34] cool I thought you talked to him, I was like whoa that's that's pretty no I'm not that cool
[59.34 → 70.60] unfortunately sorry illusions shattered oh I'm not wearing my Christmas wan sweater oh no maybe

[86.92 → 95.70] so we got a great show for you guys today apple released the iPhone battery case
[95.70 → 101.94] I'm not sure if they were thinking battery like thing that holds a charge or battery like an assault
[101.94 → 107.12] on your senses um trump wants to close up that their internet to fight terrorism
[107.12 → 113.06] uh wow I went to go talk to twitch chat really quick without realizing that it was my turn Indiegogo
[113.06 → 118.52] there's a campaign on Indiegogo right now for a computer that fits in your pocket because like
[118.52 → 123.56] that would be pretty groundbreaking actually i almost exclusively wear Linus tech tips shirts now
[123.56 → 128.26] I don't have it I'm getting more though I'm getting like four more or something yeah
[128.26 → 133.66] it's like it's gotten to the point where it's kind of ridiculous I'm either wearing like my name
[133.66 → 140.74] on my chest or like something that I did or like your name on your back or like something that like
[140.74 → 148.72] ed or like Burke designed with my name on my back also troll insurance I don't even I'm not even
[148.72 → 152.20] going to say anything else there's other information that we said in the pre-show thing I'm not even
[152.20 → 156.40] going to bother, but we're getting we're going to get to that yep later on in the show yep for now
[156.40 → 163.48] we're going to roll that intro yep I hope this works oh crap oh I have all the wrong oh I have all
[163.48 → 168.70] the wrong sponsors oh no maybe I can do this go fast no I'll pull this off hold on go fast like tribes
[168.70 → 176.68] uh hold on you can shoot something while it's walking relatively not that fast okay just calm down but
[176.68 → 181.24] what about tribes where it's like going really fast hold on I'm working on I'm working on this okay
[181.24 → 190.32] uh Linda uh oh find the edge i have to find the edge i have to find yes yeah Linda uh uh uh fresh books
[190.32 → 202.98] book yeah baby and I fix it book yeah round of applause for Linus and his team especially Linus who was the
[202.98 → 207.78] one responsible for pulling that out of the fire, and also it was his fault that it was broken in
[207.78 → 212.30] the first place you put it in the fire then you took it back out that's right doing that like hokey
[212.30 → 218.28] pokey but with literally does that count you put your right hand in you take your right hand out you
[218.28 → 226.18] scream ah my god my hand, and then you start up a twitch thing, and you're not signed in or paying any
[226.18 → 230.30] attention, so there's a riot game stream going on that means my stream is going to get no viewers
[230.30 → 236.60] sick I think our stream's still doing wow we have only 2600 viewers oh you know what that thing's
[236.60 → 243.34] always delete the YouTube thing didn't go up oh that's interesting, so this is all the hardcore
[243.34 → 248.28] only this is like hardcore only time or just whoever twitch decided to email
[248.28 → 254.68] yeah that to that's a whole other issue that's that's uh there's nothing I can really do about that
[254.68 → 262.64] what is this thing doing why are you broken YouTube 44 processed on like a one-minute video
[262.64 → 271.16] like are you for oh oh oh there 46 46 46 uh someone must have thrown an USB drive at the server
[271.16 → 275.06] dude they're using the quantum computer the quantum computer no we'll talk about that later though
[275.06 → 281.34] the quantum computer is uh is definitely quantum there's like or no right they were using the
[281.34 → 286.02] quantum computer now they're comparing it to that single core something yeah well that that well we'll
[286.02 → 290.36] talk about that okay so actually well no let's talk let's talk about things let's get into our first
[290.36 → 295.12] topic of the day today should we just start with the quantum computer no lets do Donald Trump wanting
[295.12 → 301.12] to close up the internet closing up the internet yeah because like you can just close the doors you can call
[301.12 → 307.24] up Bill Gates yeah and Bill Gates can just build a digital wall yeah, so the original article here is
[307.24 → 317.96] from Ars Technica and to be clear if you actually watch and like to put some context around this if you
[317.96 → 325.74] actually watch some of the speech he obviously doesn't have a clear enough understanding of how the
[325.74 → 335.62] internet works to have spoken correctly but some of his sentiments were not entirely ridiculous either
[335.62 → 341.42] not everything he said was completely stupid, but you're talking to internet people about internet
[341.42 → 346.48] terminology yes some of it was really stupid um I'm just going to try and I'm going to go back to my uh to
[346.48 → 351.86] my show notes for a second here because I think I put down something that uh uh blah blah blah I mean
[351.86 → 358.90] acknowledging that people are vulnerable to being recruited whether it's for
[358.90 → 364.34] Isis or whether it's um I speak from some personal experience without giving too much detail here
[364.34 → 370.10] not myself but someone that was very close to me um you know whether it's something like a pro and
[370.10 → 376.92] a suicide society or something like that people can be very susceptible to being drawn into someone who
[376.92 → 383.80] will make them feel like they fit in um and I feel like the internet has made some of these very
[383.80 → 391.48] extreme sects a little bit more accessible sects not sex it's made that more accessible too
[391.48 → 397.72] that's true but I'm not complaining about that Craigslist so some of what he's saying is
[397.72 → 405.08] is it comes from a good place I think but obviously calling up Bill Gates, or he doesn't get how it works
[405.08 → 411.16] other internet leaders to close up the internet in some way and he goes on to say you know free
[411.16 → 415.32] speech what about free speech we have to you deal with this terrorist threat that's not necessarily
[415.32 → 422.68] the right approach either but I think the bottom line is this I hope in my deepest heart of hearts that
[422.68 → 429.40] Donald Trump wins the presidency because there will never be a slow news wake news week for
[429.40 → 433.88] the entire four years that he's in so you would, you just want it because it would be hilarious yes
[434.92 → 440.20] not enough to vote for him and to anyone who's considering voting for trump just because you think
[440.20 → 447.24] it's hilarious, and you just want to troll the entirety of your country I would urge you to please reconsider
[447.24 → 455.40] because there 's's so many trolls out there that he might actually win I don't think we usually like
[455.40 → 462.76] give political voting opinions we don't but don't vote for someone to troll I think is pretty safe
[462.76 → 466.92] political advice if you genuinely believe in Donald Trump and his principles I'm not going to tell you
[466.92 → 471.88] not to vote for him that is your prerogative that would be undemocratic but if you are voting for
[471.88 → 481.08] Donald Trump because you're like don't do that because you just want no slow news way news week news
[481.08 → 487.24] week no slow news weeks for four years it would be kind of like a news week because you would just
[487.24 → 494.28] like it's just the wake of Donald Trump as he just crashes through everything at the end the entire the
[494.28 → 500.68] entire like internet like all the reporters just like crawl into the office oh my god he did more
[500.68 → 508.12] things they would die of like laughter like their abdominal muscles would actually implode upon
[508.12 → 514.84] themselves yeah, yeah so my little joke that I wanted to throw in here is that people should
[514.84 → 521.24] just start feeding him more just like not true stuff yeah the series of tubes thing oh my goodness
[521.24 → 528.12] be like you know if you just make the tubes a little bit smaller than the bad messages will be delayed too
[528.12 → 533.16] much because they're coming from too far away, and they won't make it in did you see the thing he posted
[533.16 → 539.00] about how it was like mostly blacks killing whites or something like that like some completely
[539.00 → 545.24] false like no one can figure out where it came from infographic that was like supposedly attributed
[545.24 → 552.04] to like the Seattle police department or something like that but did not they're like uh no that didn't
[552.04 → 557.80] come from here that's brutal yeah he's, and he like retweeted are you sure it was okay it was a retweet
[557.80 → 562.52] yeah because like there's been a lot of stuff where he didn't actually say it yes, and he didn't say it but
[562.52 → 567.08] like you also have to be responsible you can't be retweeting that no I don't mean that the
[567.08 → 572.04] retweeted has value I mean like there 's's I've seen a lot of jokes online where people will
[572.04 → 576.52] share things from like satire websites and be like oh my god I can't believe he said this, and it's like
[576.52 → 582.04] that's because he didn't although to be fair it wouldn't be that surprising at this point yeah
[583.56 → 588.92] so um oh apparently they did figure out where it came from all right well thank you for that either
[588.92 → 594.60] way it didn't come from the Seattle police again we're not yeah political whatever yep speaking
[594.60 → 599.48] of not being political whatever European commission officially presents plan to address Netflix like
[599.48 → 603.80] geo-blocking this I'm really excited about so the original article here is from torrent freak oh I'm
[603.80 → 609.88] sorry Brandon I did not move that computer okay sorry I was busy fixing this computer actually okay
[609.88 → 614.28] before we get into the EU's proposal which is very cool the webcam thing on that we used to have and just
[614.28 → 618.76] show Brandon trying to figure out how to walk with this thing I know right without destroying
[618.76 → 622.76] everything oh it's going to be great good job Brandon he has I was telling him this the other day
[623.40 → 629.80] Brandon never trips anymore remember the way remember he used to whoa i almost just said I now and then
[629.80 → 635.80] I was like wait that changed at some point he doesn't I know he's like he's got cat-like agility now
[637.00 → 643.08] we put too many wires down we were gonna his nickname was going to be cables he just did the
[643.08 → 648.28] foot flick i know he's like he's like a navigation master and this place is easier than
[648.28 → 653.24] the old place so he's like he's he's uh he's like effortlessly moving around here other than that he
[653.24 → 658.44] has to carry heavy things and no heavy things with like stuff coming out of them okay so the story i
[658.44 → 666.20] was going to tell is that I actually spent okay the show was still late I know but I actually spent the
[666.20 → 672.76] hour and a half so since three o'clock today okay the show starts at 4 30. I was like okay i am getting
[673.08 → 679.48] this computer working once and for all it is happening so i was like doing something with
[679.48 → 685.80] capture cards, and we've known for some time like ever since i built the first capture pc i ever
[685.80 → 694.20] built which was a shuttle with a couple intensity pros in it, we realized that mainstream platforms your
[694.20 → 701.32] your uh your z87 z97 whatever with all their PCI Express lane slid it's splitting and switching and
[701.32 → 707.88] and whatnot are just don't cooperate well with professional grade hardware sometimes yeah where
[707.88 → 713.96] it's just it's low volume hardware and not always designed to work properly in consumer devices and
[713.96 → 718.84] so I've always had trouble and even sometimes it's as simple as okay maybe I'll try the four PCI e lanes
[718.84 → 723.80] that are coming off of the DMI interface versus the split ones that are coming off the CPU or whatever
[723.80 → 730.68] the case may be um so today i was like i ran into some weird issue it was a minor issue but i was
[730.68 → 736.84] just like no, no that's enough so i went and got a x79 motherboard so we are you're running a 3960x
[736.84 → 743.56] six core extreme edition we are running a x79 workstation board like p9 x79 WS whatever from Asus
[744.12 → 750.12] 32 gigs of the most stable ram that we've had like on all of our benchmark systems that 1866 uh
[750.12 → 758.68] uh rip jaws yeah g skill stuff like we've never had any issues with yeah and then i put in four
[758.68 → 770.12] capture devices great a deck link 4k extreme a legato uh pro 60 hd60 a new one uh a black magic
[770.12 → 776.68] intensity pro and an Armenia live gamer portable attached via USB i was like okay we're going to get
[776.68 → 783.56] this stable there's got to be some combination of two yes so they're all in there and i finally
[783.56 → 789.08] got it I'm pretty sure it's working i got the audio synced needed only a slight delay so I'm pretty
[789.08 → 793.96] sure that we're in pretty good shape so i now that I've said that I'm sure that I've jinxed it forever
[793.96 → 800.52] now, but it can't be any worse than it was before oh no now I'm going to make it worse yeah okay there's no
[800.52 → 805.96] wood around here this isn't really wood yeah this isn't wood this is like the closest thing to wood
[805.96 → 813.00] that's in my lap is in my lap where are you going thank you for that Luke i did it for you
[813.00 → 820.52] so the EU has issued a proposal that would ban Netflix style geo-blocking and restrictions which sounds
[821.40 → 827.80] like fantastic news at first glance so you want to run through what this is exactly basically you know how
[827.80 → 833.08] the EU is a lot uh people might take offence to this i don't know it's a grouping of a bunch of
[833.08 → 838.12] smaller countries yeah i come from Canada we're huge every country is a small country yeah
[838.76 → 843.80] I'm not trying to say anything not in terms of population they have more people than us oh yeah
[843.80 → 848.92] we don't have that we just i mean like land mass there's a great song by the arrogant worms we've got
[848.92 → 854.68] rocks and trees and trees and rocks and rocks and trees and trees and rocks and rocks and
[854.68 → 862.04] trees and trees and rocks and trees and trees and rocks and water come on everybody
[864.28 → 869.40] it's a Canadian song anyway basically it's enabling you if you have a Netflix subscription to be able to
[869.40 → 877.16] watch it anywhere within the EU which is pretty sweet yes, but there are some caveats which i don't
[877.16 → 883.08] understand actually but okay i can explain this so basically the way that they want it to work is they
[883.08 → 888.84] want it to be illegal if I'm a British citizen for example and i subscribe to British Netflix they
[888.84 → 896.84] want it to be illegal for when i travel to France for my subscription to stop working yeah awesome love
[896.84 → 905.48] it the problem is that with these new regulations it would actually become more difficult for people who
[905.48 → 912.36] use a VPN to access a broader library of films and videos from another EU country that would no longer be
[912.36 → 918.84] possible under the new rules how i don't know that's what i don't know so that i don't know
[918.84 → 924.68] but the new rules would make it so that accessing the library that should be available in your home
[924.68 → 930.60] country is fine but accessing other libraries would not be fine the thing that worries me about this is
[930.60 → 935.08] are you now going to have to sing up with like citizen IDs or something i don't know see that's that's
[935.08 → 938.52] I'm not sure how they're going to handle that's weird I'm not sure how they're going to manage it like
[938.52 → 942.84] i know that over the years it's become more difficult for example to use a credit card that
[942.84 → 947.32] isn't issued by a bank in the country that you are still not that hard they're saying yes possible
[947.32 → 955.72] you could still find a way yeah so what I'm hoping for is that under the new rules not, not possible like
[955.72 → 961.00] not allowed but I'm hoping that it would still be it would still be somewhat possible like not
[961.00 → 965.48] allowed is fine because I'm pretty sure that's already a thing so whatever go ahead people are going to do it
[965.48 → 973.40] anyway good job i don't care there you go um and then the other one i just got a hilarious private
[973.40 → 978.92] message from uh john for Lakers john Ettinger techno buffalo uh there was a particular partner that we
[978.92 → 986.12] worked with once that i kind of off the record i was like dude don't work with them uh i i i I'm not
[986.12 → 991.00] going to indicate anything but yeah yes, yes yeah okay um so i just got a message from he's like dude i
[991.00 → 998.12] should have listened to you have a great Wang show i like our new one we have a replacement one
[998.12 → 1005.24] it's good all right um, so yeah okay, so the last one is people who are in countries uh where Netflix
[1005.24 → 1011.16] and services aren't available still won't have access yeah like that's not so that was already a thing
[1011.16 → 1017.56] yeah it's just a not better thing basically this is like a tiny really tiny step towards
[1017.56 → 1023.56] reforming the way that geo-blocking and regional restrictions are handled, and honestly it feels
[1023.56 → 1031.24] kind of like one step forward one step back um just because if it does legitimately make these other
[1031.24 → 1036.76] forms of access more difficult then we're not really helping anything um, and it forces the content
[1036.76 → 1042.20] owners to go and rewrite a bunch of their licensing deals for what is in my mind not really that helpful
[1042.20 → 1048.36] I'd like to see I'd like to see that stuff rewritten, but it's a good broad it's at least acknowledges
[1048.36 → 1053.16] that there's a problem yeah that's what I'll say yeah we're acknowledging a problem which is better than
[1053.16 → 1062.68] nothing so I've got people suggesting that it's hotspot shield no it's not hotspot shield um oh good
[1062.68 → 1068.04] that's just there's okay, so this is funny there was a Wang show at one point where we accidentally still
[1068.04 → 1073.40] had like an ancient hotspot shield logo baked into our intro and showed it uh, but we hadn't been
[1073.40 → 1079.32] working with hotspot shield for over a year, and it happened that tunnel bear was a brand-new sponsor
[1079.32 → 1087.32] starting on that show, and they were just like yo Brad what was that we're like oh that was like
[1087.32 → 1092.92] a ancient legacy thing don't worry about it there's also the time with Squarespace we gave them a freebie
[1092.92 → 1099.08] oh well yeah Squarespace i it's a miracle Squarespace still advertises with us
[1100.12 → 1104.44] why I'm because we screwed up everything with them so many times
[1105.40 → 1110.84] whatever oh i got people asking build it beautiful i got people asking how my lip feels they saw the GoPro
[1110.84 → 1118.12] uh dodgeball incident, so people are geniuses everyone has great ideas, and they love sharing them with us, they're like
[1118.12 → 1124.76] you know you're supposed to have the GoPro facing up on those mounts right oh my god we know
[1125.80 → 1131.88] we are putting the GoPro in front of our eyes in the most annoying position possible in the most
[1131.88 → 1138.44] annoying possible way not because we think that that's a stroke of genius, and it helps us see better
[1138.44 → 1145.64] or anything but because it gives a more natural feel like point of view perspective on what it is that
[1145.64 → 1149.80] we're doing that's why we're doing it is destroys your depth perception yeah we tried to put it on
[1149.80 → 1155.48] the people who were showing some amount of accuracy already so that it would like to bring them down a
[1155.48 → 1161.64] little bit make things a little bit more equally and deliver better footage this is what we do
[1161.64 → 1169.24] this is what we do for you okay is and yes Dennis still has a job no Dennis has not been deported no
[1169.24 → 1174.52] that was a joke Dennis is a valued member of our team we are not we are not deporting him the problem
[1174.52 → 1182.92] is that POV sucks well if POV sucks then eight inches above POV is definitely not better so why is
[1182.92 → 1193.56] that search term you so much I'm going to leave you with that bro so let's go ahead and move into our next
[1193.56 → 1198.04] topic here this is cool so i mean if it wasn't cool we probably wouldn't be talking about it on
[1198.04 → 1202.44] the show except sometimes we talk about stuff that's totally not cool for the sake of talking
[1202.44 → 1209.96] about stuff that's yes stupid yeah um so google's d-wave 2x quantum computer a hundred times faster
[1209.96 → 1216.84] than regular computers yeah now okay excuse me a hundred million times faster sorry, sorry i misread that
[1216.84 → 1221.56] which the scale makes the point that we're going to make here not really matter, but it's still a valid
[1221.56 → 1227.56] yeah okay, so basically this was acquired by google and NASA in 2013 they're keeping it in their like
[1227.56 → 1235.00] like uh super computing lab in Silicon Valley somewhere underground something along those lines um
[1236.76 → 1246.20] and basically in a nutshell it was able to achieve 10 000 years of computing in seconds the thing is
[1246.20 → 1251.88] they're not actually really showing what they're comparing it to, and sometimes they're like yeah
[1251.88 → 1258.84] uh you know classic computer a classic single core computer was what it was compared to
[1258.84 → 1263.96] well in one place they say classic computer in another place they say i think like consumer and
[1263.96 → 1269.08] then somewhere else they're finally like single core and I'm like oh so it'd be really nice to know
[1269.08 → 1275.40] what it's being compared to, but it is a hundred million times faster yes so at the same time it's
[1275.40 → 1283.24] like still very cool yeah um but with that said we're still a long ways away from it being useful for
[1283.24 → 1290.04] any kind of practical practical practical matters well okay uh broadly useful, and we'll explain that a
[1290.04 → 1296.44] little bit more in a minute so basically for just as a refresher regular computing uses zeros and ones or bits
[1296.44 → 1304.20] quantum computing uses quits and in the case of the d-wave 2x you can have up to 1097 quits so
[1304.20 → 1309.56] that's that's that many more different states, and then it's like quantum nonsense with like it can
[1309.56 → 1314.76] have this value and this value and all this kind of very complicated stuff that quite frankly I'm not
[1314.76 → 1321.32] enough of a scientist to really properly understand talk about anything in this realm i try to give like
[1321.32 → 1326.12] a simplified version and then people try to murder me so I'm just not even gonna yeah so let's not bother
[1326.12 → 1331.24] uh, but the point is that what it's perfect for what they were what they were able to find
[1331.24 → 1337.96] that the d-wave 2x was able to do really, really well was solving an optimization problem so an
[1337.96 → 1342.76] optimization problem could be something like let's let's come up with something very, very simple so if
[1342.76 → 1350.84] i want to make the best possible oh i don't know soup can okay so you've got you've got a bunch of
[1350.84 → 1356.04] different variables you've got the height you've got the circumference you've got the uh you've got
[1356.04 → 1361.80] the ridges that you can put in the side you've got uh having a curvature or no curvature to the top and
[1361.80 → 1366.52] the bottom and so you could come up with a value that you want like i want the strongest soup can that
[1366.52 → 1372.28] holds x amount of volume or whatever the case may be so that would be an optimization problem so you
[1372.28 → 1378.84] could have a lot of different variables that the computer has to solve for many different scenarios of
[1378.84 → 1384.20] all of them to get the best possible result that would be an optimization problem yeah in this case
[1384.20 → 1390.76] the problem that the d-wave 2x solved had about a thousand variables and then each one of those like
[1391.40 → 1394.92] I'm sure a lot of people in the audience know what a variable is, but each one of those will have
[1394.92 → 1400.68] crazy amounts of values so that's an entry for a value or any value yeah like it could be a
[1400.68 → 1407.32] variable is just as a placeholder it's what x or y or whatever else so you had a thousand x's y's
[1407.32 → 1410.60] you're going to run out of letters of the alphabet don't worry too much about that part though
[1410.60 → 1418.68] and it found the optimal answer for all of those variables um the problem right now is that there's
[1418.68 → 1424.36] only a handful of people in the world who are qualified to actually input information input
[1424.36 → 1429.48] information into the very hard to tell it to do things which makes sense if you know things about
[1429.48 → 1433.24] computers that's kind of yeah, yeah so they're good they're going to have to work on making it a little
[1433.24 → 1442.44] bit easier to use okay and then yeah and then and then it'll be more useful, but quantum computing is
[1442.44 → 1450.04] still very like look at who has if it's an it's a long way away from you playing you know half-life
[1450.04 → 1459.24] half-life three on one although probably less far away than half-life three oh rip okay sorry, sorry
[1459.24 → 1465.32] everyone sorry to those who are still holding out hope rough speaking of that troll that you just did
[1465.32 → 1467.00] oh my goodness so this
[1469.48 → 1477.24] what I'll say in advance of this topic is that i don't think there's a way for us to cover this
[1477.24 → 1484.76] that won't upset the particularly sensitive of our social justice warrior viewers
[1486.92 → 1492.36] so someone's going to be upset by the end of this and that's a shame and if the social justice
[1492.36 → 1496.44] warriors aren't upset which they probably already are because we said their name i did call them that
[1497.88 → 1502.60] then if they're not upset then the people who aren't in that category will probably be upset
[1502.60 → 1509.00] because we probably talked about it too lightly yeah so basically let's let's run let's run
[1509.00 → 1512.68] through what this is let's run through what this is in a nutshell yeah we're damned if we do we're
[1512.68 → 1519.48] damned if we don't yeah so Chubb which to be clear is not the company that makes locks i wonder if they're
[1519.48 → 1526.44] doing this because someone called them fat i wow was wondering if we were going to go there no, no no
[1526.44 → 1530.68] we're not about that before the show i was like you know we aren't going to go there if you troll the
[1530.68 → 1535.56] company that offers troll insurance yeah what happens i don't know like trollception or they
[1535.56 → 1540.36] have the troll insurance on their own like i don't know can you do i don't think you can do that because
[1540.36 → 1545.80] you'd have to have some sounds like yeah all over the place okay anyway so Chubb the insurance company
[1545.80 → 1551.64] not the company that makes locks and security stuff yep is offering this to their clients in the UK
[1551.64 → 1558.44] starting in 2016. They're defining it as three or more acts by the same person or group wondering
[1558.44 → 1567.88] how that's defined to harass threaten or intimidate a customer so claims of up to 75 000 can be made for
[1567.88 → 1575.32] counselling relocation due to online abuse or missed work, and they offer certain things like reputation
[1575.32 → 1581.40] management which can help restore your public image or a hiring of a forensic specialist who can
[1581.40 → 1588.76] try to trace the origins of the trolling so the policy uh so they see it as a way to help
[1588.76 → 1595.00] clients get back to where they were before the incidents occurred um
[1598.52 → 1604.68] wow now that I've now that I've kind of vomited all that into the microphone I'm left sort of
[1604.68 → 1609.08] speechless there okay are certain things in here I don't know if I'd get insurance for it but
[1609.08 → 1614.52] there are certain things in here that I can actually totally defend I'm going to advocate this lets do
[1614.52 → 1621.48] it let's do it hit me hit me bro come at me bro loser that's one we're gonna need like a counter
[1622.60 → 1627.08] okay if I had insurance on this and I was like this specific person and pointed out you, you'd lose in
[1627.08 → 1634.84] like a day right, but this is online harassment I harass you in person hangouts and stuff that's that is
[1634.84 → 1645.16] online is it online if you're in the same building yes really yes so it's still going out to the
[1645.16 → 1650.60] server and then coming back so snapping like dick pics and hangouts sing them to you that would be hold
[1650.60 → 1657.56] on hold on that's online if you're in the same building but if what is I'm in the same room what
[1657.56 → 1662.84] if I'm in the same room if we were literally like yeah, and it was both of us that would still be online
[1662.84 → 1666.44] okay, okay anyway carry on if I was a willing participant then that wouldn't be harassing carry
[1666.44 → 1675.24] on carry on okay so defend it anyway so if you are someone uh like say remember the Boston bombing
[1675.24 → 1682.60] yes okay not cool thing yep we did it right if you're one of the people that they targeted, and you get
[1682.60 → 1687.40] death threats and stuff, and you did nothing that sucks and having a team of people backing you up
[1687.40 → 1694.60] and doing what is this one uh reputation management team yeah that would probably be helpful because
[1694.60 → 1700.04] that totally wasn't their fault, and they got massively trolled on and that probably sucks yeah on like many
[1700.04 → 1706.92] different levels the thing is while there's definitely cases where online trolling goes way too
[1706.92 → 1711.96] far and is like super not okay like the Boston bombing thing where they picked the wrong person yeah
[1711.96 → 1717.96] there's definitely other examples of this I think the vast majority of the usage for this is going to
[1717.96 → 1724.84] be fraudulent to be claimed on things that are totally bull crap and one of my notes on here is that
[1724.84 → 1729.72] I'm hoping it's only for ultra aggressive cases uh like where I'm talking about with the Boston bombing
[1729.72 → 1735.48] thing totally wasn't their fault totally got slammed on really badly and totally wasn't their fault
[1736.28 → 1740.76] I think it's mostly going to be like kids on cod yelling at each other and then one of them getting
[1740.76 → 1745.88] sad and someone's parents being like well I have this troll insurance thing let's just I don't know
[1745.88 → 1753.00] they're all cod players so that's a group so I mean it's one of those things where like
[1756.36 → 1761.56] and it comes back to like I was making light of it before but the line between online harassment and
[1761.56 → 1770.20] in-person harassment is very, very gray um like it's you know people who don't believe in cyberbullying
[1770.20 → 1774.36] will often say well just unplug your internet connection, but it is very rarely I don't believe
[1774.36 → 1780.60] in a lot of what people define as cyberbullying no and that's true of me as well but it does
[1780.60 → 1787.08] exist something that people have to be aware of is that when the line is gray it can be uh it can
[1787.08 → 1792.92] be something that can't be gotten rid of as easily as unplugging an Ethernet cable like or just not
[1792.92 → 1798.92] playing that game if you like aren't very good at League of Legends and people make fun of you for it a lot
[1800.20 → 1805.16] maybe ignore chat or just if that affects you that much just don't play league or play against bots
[1805.16 → 1811.08] or something and another option would be to get better yeah like I don't count that as like you
[1811.08 → 1818.52] just need to but there are many instances where the online cyberbullying can bleed over into
[1818.52 → 1825.16] real life like it's you know someone sharing uh uh uh and you know improperly obtained picture of you
[1825.16 → 1829.16] and then having to deal with the fallout of that that's I didn't even think about that one that's
[1829.16 → 1834.28] brutal so the line is very gray between what is online harassment, and what is in
[1834.28 → 1838.28] person harassment because they can become one and the same, and it's not always as simple as
[1838.28 → 1843.16] just like oh well I just won't go online if I put my head in the sand I mean it's funny because it's the
[1843.16 → 1848.44] same group of people saying well just ignore it as the same group of people that would make fun of
[1848.44 → 1853.88] people for putting their head in the sand and ignoring a problem so like if is is literally the forensic
[1853.88 → 1858.76] specialist that's tracing the origins of your trolling is like oh you're bad at video games
[1860.12 → 1866.28] then I don't know man figure it out if it's random anonymous people on the internet talking to you
[1866.28 → 1871.88] in a very contained situation and once you stop playing that game it's over maybe find a solution
[1872.52 → 1878.12] I don't know leave chat don't read chat do something if you're actually being like
[1879.64 → 1883.72] improperly obtained picture yeah we did it Reddit if it's like one of those types
[1883.72 → 1888.60] of situations like sure I think this makes sense yeah but I mean they're they're gonna there's gonna
[1888.60 → 1892.44] be at least paying for troll insurance because you think that's going to happen to you is insane
[1893.96 → 1899.96] most insurance is set up like that where the odds are so slim that you'd actually kind of like I mean
[1899.96 → 1905.80] you look at the way the math works yeah is there have to be enough suckers who are paying for it and
[1905.80 → 1911.72] don't need it to compensate for everyone who claims it and lots more yeah that's the whole idea that's
[1911.72 → 1920.20] insurance so I did get an uh I did get like stop playing league oh i got a message I have to
[1920.20 → 1925.24] interrupt this program to bring you a shout-out for marks I don't know if he wants me to give his last
[1925.24 → 1932.92] name but I promised him a shout-out on the dual quad-core old server gaming rig thing I thought you did
[1932.92 → 1938.60] I thought I did too, but it didn't make it into the final cut and then i were I watched it I asked for it to be added to the YouTube one
[1938.60 → 1943.16] and then I never well I never watched the YouTube one so maybe it did get added maybe he's trolling
[1943.16 → 1948.84] me I swear it said something someone gave me this anyway whatever it was marks who provided
[1948.84 → 1957.00] the eons no not Mark's work warehouse no not carl marks okay well anyway the point is
[1957.80 → 1963.48] he provided the motherboard and the eons and the ram and the idea for doing that video so I wanted to give a
[1963.48 → 1970.12] massive shout out to uh to to to marks here who is apparently watching the show so good job
[1970.12 → 1975.96] watching the show hi marks you excellent person he also does some writing now for us maybe I watched
[1975.96 → 1982.92] like a pre-cut can this finish processing no the YouTube announcement is not done processing yet
[1982.92 → 1987.40] I don't know what they're doing they've got hamsters running the servers right now apparently
[1987.40 → 1994.12] so I'm gonna I'm going to try uploading it again and see if oh that's from last week I do not want that
[1994.12 → 2004.84] to go up to the oh why do you hate me internet we should do the thing after this do the thing yeah
[2005.88 → 2012.68] you are the thing to me do we have it I don't know I don't even know what you're talking about
[2012.68 → 2017.88] maybe I don't know I'm sure you don't know what you're talking about I'm fairly sure you don't
[2017.88 → 2021.56] know what you're talking about because I don't know what you're talking about
[2024.12 → 2030.76] don't make me put my head in the sand don't make me ignore this really hard okay
[2034.68 → 2042.28] um all right why don't we get into why don't we get into this this is great our source for the uh
[2042.28 → 2047.80] our oh actually no why don't we talk about our sponsors so our first sponsor of the day boom
[2047.80 → 2055.00] lynda.com we have got to get that old wan show logo fixed in our lower thirds so if you're not familiar

[2215.32 → 2222.20] a new I fix it offer code for you guys and now is definitely a good time if uh oh I wonder if they
[2222.20 → 2228.76] would get it to you in time okay well holiday season I'm not sure if you'll have to check with I fix it find
[2228.76 → 2233.72] out if they can get you an awesome gift for the uh for the techie, and you know what just grab an old one
[2233.72 → 2238.68] for now okay there's one there yeah well we have lots of those we'll, we'll settle for the old
[2238.68 → 2244.12] one today I well part of the problem is I took one of the new ones home that's like did no I didn't
[2244.12 → 2249.24] take both of them I didn't even know we had to yeah we have to yeah i I snagged one like I knew you
[2249.24 → 2255.72] snagged so fast so fast so I fix it has guides for how to take apart your mobile devices put
[2255.72 → 2262.44] them back together um computers uh desktops even laptops phones tablets all that kind of stuff
[2262.44 → 2266.76] and they have a full lineup of tools that help you do it this is actually this is a ancient
[2266.76 → 2273.24] one I think um but everything from their pro tech tool kit to their more wait no this is the
[2273.24 → 2279.64] this is the 52 driver kit sorry so the pro tech tool kit which has an ESD strap, and it's like some
[2279.64 → 2284.36] pry tools and actually their new one is even better it's got their suction cup in it and all kinds of
[2284.36 → 2290.44] cool stuff all the way up to even like entire full like briefcase size kits with a multimeter
[2290.44 → 2294.60] uh all the drivers the other set of drivers which we have around here somewhere as well
[2294.60 → 2298.60] the problem is we can never keep track of where these are because we use them so often and we
[2298.60 → 2304.04] have so many, but they're great I love them that's why we have Tarzan half the time I go into that room
[2304.04 → 2312.12] Tarzan has one on the desk next to him, I wonder if he does anyway the point is um they've got all the
[2312.12 → 2318.44] stuff you need, and you can save ten dollars on a purchase of fifty dollars or more by heading over
[2318.44 → 2326.12] to ifixit.com slash Linus and entering the code when at checkout that offer code changes fairly
[2326.12 → 2330.76] frequently so stay tuned make sure you're always watching the wan show to get the latest fixity offer
[2330.76 → 2336.44] codes I guess that's that's pretty much it so it was so good that someone from work just took it
[2336.44 → 2343.40] no one better have like taken it home also well you did well I took one of them I'm the boss I could
[2343.40 → 2349.80] and I took part of one I didn't take like the whole check it out no we don't enter tools in the system
[2349.80 → 2356.92] wow so I can just take tools home well you have to let me know I let you know see communication
[2356.92 → 2365.16] yeah okay, but it wasn't here when we needed that's true it wasn't here the new one's really nice
[2365.16 → 2370.28] it is that's magnetic yeah it's got more stuff, and it's yeah it's really nice anyway all right so
[2370.28 → 2376.44] let's get into our next somewhat touchy uh somewhat touchy topic here okay this is so stupid with how
[2376.44 → 2386.76] 2015 is going everything's a touchy topic 2015? yeah, oh, oh balls okay I just screwed up the
[2386.76 → 2394.12] thing well you know what balls whatever uh touchy are you propositioning me I thought i already
[2394.12 → 2404.84] did that oh right but I'm on air all right, so this is worth this is worth having a look at
[2404.84 → 2413.16] okay yeah okay so the national crime agency this is what UK or something right yeah um released this
[2413.72 → 2420.92] TV ad spot which we can have a quick look at basically it's the kind of the two over enthusiastic
[2420.92 → 2425.16] parents I don't know if you guys have audio I'm just going to turn it off regardless uh right I turned
[2425.16 → 2431.64] off the wrong thing um so they're bragging about how when he loses an online game he just takes down the
[2431.64 → 2437.64] server and oh those DDoS things he does them all the time he's so smart they actually I thought they did
[2437.64 → 2443.48] a perfect job of this spot overall so they're bragging about what he's doing etc etc etc and the
[2443.48 → 2454.20] punch line is uppity bop pity uh so yeah I guess that's um what else do what else do you want to know
[2454.20 → 2462.36] they're like start at the beginning and then yeah now we're in an interrogation room now to be clear
[2462.36 → 2468.12] there were some scare tactics involved here of course it's like this kid could be yours, and it's
[2468.12 → 2473.64] got to do one of those cyber crime wrecks lives kind of thing because I think those are
[2473.64 → 2479.56] mandatory by law in any kind of public service announcement or uh or like warning type
[2479.56 → 2483.80] thing I guess PSA would probably be the correct term for this um but
[2483.80 → 2496.84] the issue that I have with how people are receiving this is is is okay well first let's first
[2496.84 → 2503.48] let's get into this so I'm going to start with our source here, so blogs are taking this campaign and i
[2503.48 → 2508.92] think running completely the wrong direction with it yeah it's a really obnoxious ad hey yeah so this
[2508.92 → 2515.24] blog the next web yeah i know super obnoxious site the writing isn't much better goes okay
[2515.24 → 2520.60] according to the national crime agency the UK's version of the FBI they have a new campaign that's
[2520.60 → 2527.24] aimed at cutting cyber crime especially amongst teams teams teams not teams cybercrime
[2527.24 → 2532.28] teams are by the, so this is where this is where it goes all full-on sensationalist never go full
[2532.28 → 2537.96] sensationalist by the NCA's definition we might all be super hackers here's what to look for is your child
[2537.96 → 2542.20] spending all the time all of their time online are they interested in coding do they have
[2542.20 → 2546.60] independent learning material on computing do they have irregular sleeping patterns do they get
[2546.60 → 2551.64] an income from their online activities do you know why and how are they resistant when asked about
[2551.64 → 2556.36] what they do online do they use the full data allowance of the home broadband have they become
[2556.36 → 2562.92] more socially isolated hey mom in fact yeah I know right me too everything in fact all these warning
[2562.92 → 2567.72] signs would apply to my friends and colleagues blah blah blah but I'm not an I'm not a cyber criminal
[2567.72 → 2571.96] as you can see no parent should assume that any of these things are precursors to a life of infamy
[2571.96 → 2577.48] and really badass scenes of movie hackery they're not saying and the bottom line hold on the bottom
[2577.48 → 2585.64] line according to this blogger talk to your kids well this blogger never read the actual NCA page
[2586.84 → 2593.96] nice flowers Dennis because that's exactly what they said here it is here's the actual article that
[2593.96 → 2599.48] people should probably look at before crapping all over what I think is actually a fairly well put
[2599.48 → 2605.08] together little piece here so what is cyber crime they give examples of cyber crime gaining access to
[2605.08 → 2609.48] someone's computer network without their permission making supplying or obtaining malware carrying out
[2609.48 → 2615.72] DDoS distributed denial-of-service attacks they don't even include but I mean I think probably the most
[2616.44 → 2622.68] outstanding thing about this article here in this campaign is that they're not even going after
[2622.68 → 2627.24] piracy they're ignoring piracy they don't even mention it they're not like they're not even
[2627.24 → 2632.28] including piracy under the same umbrella as cyber crime something that I wish more people had noticed
[2632.28 → 2637.40] and would have realized is actually a pretty important distinction because they're really not the same
[2637.40 → 2642.76] thing okay so that said ripped into who will save us now that's actually kind of funny
[2642.76 → 2650.36] hacking into the system into the system access connected yeah um so then they go on to say okay
[2650.36 → 2654.92] well here are the consequences, and they don't even say you're going to go to jail forever you could get
[2654.92 → 2660.04] a visit and warning from police or NCA officers you could get arrested their computers could be seized
[2660.04 → 2664.04] and they could be prevented from being allowed to access the internet penalties are fine up to 10 years in
[2664.04 → 2671.32] prison for serious offences things to look out for are they resistant when asked what they do online do they
[2671.32 → 2675.32] get an income from their online activities do you know why and how it's funny how when I read this
[2675.32 → 2679.24] in a different voice it doesn't sound like such a crazy thing are they spending all of their time
[2679.24 → 2685.00] online do they have irregular sleeping patterns have they become more socially isolated okay many of
[2685.00 → 2690.52] these things are just normal teenage behaviours this is right out of the freaking article basically the
[2690.52 → 2696.36] second line taken in isolation they don't necessarily suggest that a young person is at risk of being
[2696.36 → 2701.88] involved they are just possible indicators that your child is getting into the wrong activities
[2701.88 → 2706.52] if you're ml pro it's fine if a young person is showing several of these signs try and have a
[2706.52 → 2710.20] conversation with them about their online activities this will allow you to assess their computer
[2710.20 → 2715.00] knowledge proficiency so you can understand what they're doing explain the consequences of cybercrime
[2715.00 → 2720.28] and help them make the right choice there's nothing wrong with the way that this is written and then
[2720.28 → 2725.24] there's another video if you scroll down a little bit this is great ways to use cyber skills positively so
[2725.24 → 2730.84] here's a bunch of stuff and then this video is great former hacker ex-hacker went to jail he was
[2730.84 → 2737.72] like yup if I had realized someone well he said if someone had presented opportunities to me, I would
[2737.72 → 2745.32] have done it, so the whole idea here isn't actually about like oh my god your kid's a criminal it's like
[2745.32 → 2750.60] maybe talk to them and show them like hey you're interested in this stuff that's cool you can there's a
[2750.60 → 2755.40] bunch of different job paths you can go down and so you know I think a lot of the time people
[2755.40 → 2761.16] will go like oh they're saying that if I have computer skills I'm a hacker oh yeah anyone with coding
[2761.16 → 2768.44] skills is a hacker well no but not everyone with lock picking skills is a burglar but with that said
[2768.44 → 2775.40] or you are a hacker but not in the bad way yes and if my son or daughter is picking up a lot of lock
[2775.40 → 2781.40] picking skills spending a lot of time out late at night and has inexplicable new possessions which is
[2781.40 → 2786.92] pretty much what that list was saying that doesn't mean I'm i I doesn't mean that they're a burglar
[2786.92 → 2793.40] they could be uh they could have a lock picking job on the side for a locksmith and know someone that
[2793.40 → 2798.44] works a lot and can only hang out at nighttime or whatever, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't have that
[2798.44 → 2805.16] conversation hey what are you up to you know that if you're doing something that's not a good thing to be up
[2805.16 → 2808.84] to that that can be a problem these are the consequences this is your life you need to honestly
[2808.84 → 2813.88] like that's all the NCA is saying if your parenting style happens to be one of those where you're
[2813.88 → 2819.64] like ultra involved with your kids interests there's a lot of really cool hacking stuff you can do
[2819.64 → 2825.88] that's like not criminal even remotely, and they outline a lot of that stuff yeah like there's some
[2825.88 → 2832.60] really cool you can do making things work the way you want them to work is a very cool thing, and it's fun
[2833.32 → 2841.08] so there you go I just wanted to throw another voice into the mix of people that are
[2841.08 → 2846.92] that are trash talking this because they apparently didn't take it's not even a long article it took
[2846.92 → 2852.28] me like a minute and a half to read it and go this is perfectly fine they've actually tackled this in
[2852.28 → 2857.56] probably the best way they possibly could because the reality of it is a lot of the people leaving
[2857.56 → 2864.52] comments on that video are being elitist to douches about it quite frankly this campaign is designed
[2864.52 → 2871.72] for not you tech-savvy youngsters yeah I know that you guys are you know oh I know what a DDoS is you
[2871.72 → 2876.76] know blah blah blah if it's in this context you know whatever like you understand all this stuff but
[2876.76 → 2881.88] they were trying to present it in terms that like my mom would understand or maybe someone slightly
[2881.88 → 2886.68] younger than my mom I'm not exactly a team someone in chat was like Luke they're called network
[2886.68 → 2890.92] professionals or app developers no they're not that's that's not the only types of hacking at
[2890.92 → 2895.16] all that's not the well that's not the only types of ethical hacking at all there's stuff you can do at
[2895.16 → 2900.20] home that affects literally zero other people that is hacking that has nothing to do with networking
[2900.20 → 2902.52] it has nothing to do with that development, and it's fun
[2902.52 → 2910.36] and they even define the cyber crime what is a cyber crime really, really well it's when you access
[2910.36 → 2915.16] someone else's network without permission you can access someone else's network with permission
[2915.16 → 2919.88] and that can be hacking if they're is you're is you're saying okay I'm going to try and keep you out
[2919.88 → 2924.36] you try and get in that's that kid that's practice think of it that way I think there's still
[2924.36 → 2929.24] relative laws around that but if you do it like in a contained environment and stuff they have hackathons
[2929.24 → 2937.64] yeah like which are actually hacking in some cases, and they're like good it's helpful so yeah there
[2937.64 → 2943.00] you go tesla has like huge bounties on if you can hack something in the model s tell them how you did
[2943.00 → 2952.28] it maybe works with them on how to solve the problem great all right so let's get into the funniest topic
[2952.28 → 2958.76] of the week probably completely unintentionally funny although part of me really does wonder
[2959.24 → 2966.92] like are they just seeing how far they can push things is that what apple is up to at this point
[2968.36 → 2972.76] this has been making okay the white case is literally hilarious
[2974.44 → 2981.32] they've been making it is reminds me of a scene from alien it's like i I feel like I feel like a battery
[2981.32 → 2987.56] alien is going to like push itself out of the back of the phone there was a point in time where like we
[2987.56 → 2991.40] can hate on apple as much as you want, but there was a point in time that if you walked into an apple
[2991.40 → 2997.32] store you could pretty much assume that everything especially directly from apple was probably solid in
[2997.32 → 3005.80] terms of like design manufacturing yeah this is not for like a bunch of reasons it's one of them the
[3005.80 → 3013.00] material that it is picks up things and clings to it, so there 's's a video Lou has unboxed therapy
[3013.00 → 3019.00] where he puts the white one in his jeans pocket, and he shows like these are they're not the loosest jeans ever
[3019.00 → 3025.72] but they're definitely not skinny jeans ever either um drops the phone in his pocket pulls it back out, and it's like covered in lint
[3026.68 → 3039.00] like what it's like I've given a lot of crap to companies over the years that have released products that I like what I like to say is obviously no one ever actually used it
[3039.00 → 3053.00] um like adtech had a case what was it the uh the dark force df85 or something like that where i I remember talking to I think you about it where I was just like did anyone at adtech build a computer in this tower
[3053.00 → 3063.00] oh yeah yeah yeah okay and I was pretty sure that they did not must not um this really feels this really feels like one of those kinds of things where whereabouts in this video is that part
[3063.00 → 3069.00] whereabouts in this video is that part you'll see him standing up he's standing up uh I don't think it's
[3070.04 → 3076.28] yeah he puts the phone in first so it's a little bit after this where does he stand up dang it Lou it's before that bit oh
[3077.16 → 3082.20] here we go here we go okay so line of screen share there we go there's our buddy Lou so he puts a white
[3082.20 → 3086.44] phone in his pocket takes it back out and then look at this he doesn't even get that close in on it
[3086.44 → 3092.20] yeah and like, but it's like covered in junk so it's just like what are you what are you actually
[3092.20 → 3097.72] doing um this is really great I was reading um I was reading the comments under someone in the
[3097.72 → 3105.96] chat has a df85 oh okay I'm sorry to hear that um okay so uh this was really great I was reading comments
[3105.96 → 3111.96] on someone's article about this somewhere, and they're just like yeah i at the Apple Store I work at
[3111.96 → 3120.76] we're all just still recommending the Sophie case that we still stock that's like way slicker in
[3120.76 → 3128.12] terms of design has a higher capacity battery and just we like we can't figure out any advantage to
[3128.12 → 3134.84] the first party accessory here so apparently it's been nicknamed the hump already um saw a really great
[3134.84 → 3140.76] meme already someone photoshopped a picture of uh, uh apple's new lead designer, and it's just a camel in the
[3140.76 → 3151.24] the middle of the desert and apparently this is sexy now so I mean here's what I have to say my
[3151.24 → 3155.08] favourite thing about this and I don't remember if I already said this on the show or if I said this in
[3155.08 → 3160.68] the in the show announcement or whatever but this is what I have to say about this I had a really
[3160.68 → 3167.72] great week because this week like I guess couple weeks I got my hands on the Surface Book yeah I know
[3167.72 → 3173.32] you didn't have a great week I got my hands on the Surface Book Microsoft's clear acknowledgement
[3173.32 → 3180.04] clear message to me directly that I was right and that the Surface Pro 3 is not a replacement for a
[3180.04 → 3186.28] laptop because if it was, they wouldn't have needed to release a laptop so I really enjoyed that like
[3186.28 → 3190.84] it made me feel so warm and fuzzy inside uh not warm and fuzzy enough to not return the Surface Book I did
[3190.84 → 3195.88] end up doing that I was prepared to keep it if it was good enough okay but I still prefer the blade 14
[3196.20 → 3205.16] um even though I don't game really much at all on it um and then this clear indication that apple is
[3205.16 → 3212.04] acknowledging that I was right it is time to acknowledge that the iPhone's battery is not good
[3212.04 → 3219.00] enough and that if that's what it takes if a kludge solution with a hump hanging off the back of it
[3219.00 → 3226.28] is what it takes it's time to lose the snobby attitude about making it thinner and
[3226.28 → 3232.28] making it more flat or whatever and just make a slightly thicker phone it could even be a different
[3232.28 → 3239.72] model like the iPhone 6s extended or whatever you want or the 6e or whatever you want to call it
[3239.72 → 3246.68] one that has better battery that would be great thanks
[3249.48 → 3253.56] so uh yeah I guess that's all there wow is that all there is to really say about if it's really
[3253.56 → 3258.68] stupid man what were they thinking there's nothing it is picks up lint it doesn't look very good I've
[3258.68 → 3262.76] heard that it doesn't feel very good in terms of material but I'm not sure about that yeah I've heard
[3262.76 → 3267.96] that it feels awkward to hold in your hand this is great also apple's acknowledgement that a curved
[3267.96 → 3271.88] shape at the back is probably Kasper to hold although apple you went about it all wrong
[3272.76 → 3280.44] just throwing that out there you could see the LG g4 for pointers a curved back without also having a
[3280.44 → 3286.84] flat back and some weird like spandex leotard that it wears that is like stuffed to make its junk look
[3286.84 → 3291.72] bigger and like a lot of people have been saying it's super just looks like they had a bunch
[3291.72 → 3298.76] of batteries, and they're like hey we can put some material around it sell them I guess like it
[3298.76 → 3302.68] it doesn't look like a product design thing it looks like hey we have a lot of these let's find
[3302.68 → 3308.52] some way to get rid of them which I don't believe is what happened no very clear no, but it looks that
[3308.52 → 3315.16] way which is bad yeah it really don't want it to look that way compatibility at least it works with the
[3315.16 → 3325.16] six so at least they didn't be like yeah it's only for six s customers right um yeah I don't know yeah
[3327.32 → 3332.52] this is great oh yeah uh wired couldn't even get a full charge off the case it's only about a 75
[3332.52 → 3336.92] charge so that puts it somewhere in the neighbourhood of probably around 1600 William hours it's not even
[3336.92 → 3345.96] equivalent to the onboard battery so wow full of fail um so I guess we're into kind of rapid fire
[3345.96 → 3351.80] topics for the day yep it's going to be kind of a short show today I guess it's okay not that short liking
[3351.80 → 3359.32] the wrong picture on Facebook can get you imprisoned in Thailand to be clear this is something that um
[3359.32 → 3365.72] Thai people are mostly aware of but defaming the monarchy is illegal under the criminal Thai criminal code
[3365.72 → 3375.56] 112 so um yeah basically in a nutshell this guy uh was sentenced to 30 years in prison his
[3375.56 → 3380.52] Facebook activity was deemed insulting to the monarchy people were just making fun of 10 years
[3380.52 → 3387.64] in prison for hacking yeah yeah that is some pretty monarchy that's some pretty brutal stuff I was reading
[3387.64 → 3392.60] an article about this and uh one of the comments under it was what about freedom of speech yeah freedom
[3392.60 → 3400.28] speech is like not a thing in a lot of parts of the world actually this is cool actually I had not
[3400.28 → 3405.48] seen this I must have skipped over this speedtest.net now allows users to check their internet speeds
[3405.48 → 3413.88] using html5 no more flash required very excellent I wonder if the test that website felt so old I want
[3413.88 → 3419.16] to uh I want to do a speed test right now I'm going to do one remember it's not going to be 100 i know but
[3419.16 → 3423.96] I'm going to do it anyway I'm going to do it anyway don't screenshot it I will not screenshot it oh what
[3423.96 → 3429.96] uh what do you have to do they've got a HTML html5 beta site that you have to access so I'm gonna
[3429.96 → 3437.32] have to I'll go find that beta dot uh I don't know um I'll find it you keep doing things I want to find
[3437.32 → 3444.20] it you do a thing get wrecked what if we just both try to find it what if we just both try to find it good
[3444.20 → 3454.04] good idea Linus I think it is beta dot yeah oh I think so way to go Luke
[3456.12 → 3466.92] I blame you for this no, no it's not, or it's not oh oh oh so bad WWW doesn't work
[3466.92 → 3474.84] how long did it take you to resolve that on infotech tips.com 10 minutes did we have that
[3474.84 → 3482.28] problem yeah exactly oh we didn't have it set up correctly for like a bit and I was like hey Luke
[3482.28 → 3488.92] when you type in the WWW it doesn't work you're like oh yeah right okay I don't even remember all
[3488.92 → 3496.68] right all right yeah so it doesn't look like there's nothing really going on so they're like html5 we'll
[3496.68 → 3501.32] do basically yeah it looks kind of different I can add like don't worry don't worry I got this
[3502.44 → 3509.08] I got this I got this book so there you go looks a little something like that high speed internet
[3509.08 → 3515.72] internet uh it doesn't work properly for us um I've talked to our ISP about the fact that our internet
[3515.72 → 3521.88] never tests at the speed that where it's supposedly rated at, and they're just like well cold hard truth
[3521.88 → 3530.36] is this um the servers that are hosting speed tests services they're not exclusive to that
[3530.36 → 3535.56] and they've got gigabit pipes so unless your speed testing to a server that has a gigabit pipe
[3535.56 → 3539.80] has nothing else going on and has no one else running a speed test you're not going to see your full speed
[3539.80 → 3545.40] because you're on a gigabit pipe and I'm like that makes sense i just kind of assumed that like they
[3545.40 → 3552.36] were more powerful it seems to be working yeah like we could be effective speeds yeah but like
[3552.36 → 3558.20] I can upload something faster than 285.98 megabit per second right now yeah that's what that's what
[3558.20 → 3563.48] I mean like it's its not like our internet's working it's just it's speed test it's like nope
[3563.48 → 3568.28] your internet's too fast I can't measure it and there are cases where you can measure full gigabit like
[3568.28 → 3572.84] for example in Google's campus I was able to get one millisecond ping gigabit up gigabit down, but that was
[3572.84 → 3578.36] because the speed test server is probably in the same damn building wouldn't be surprised so at all
[3578.36 → 3585.72] so there you go with that wouldn't that just kill you if you lived like 10 blocks away from like a
[3585.72 → 3591.08] google building or something like that, and you couldn't get google fibre it's like can I just can I just
[3591.08 → 3597.08] run like a really long Ethernet cable speaking of running a really long Ethernet cable it's confirmed
[3597.08 → 3605.40] um ubiquity networks is sending us their dish based point to point gigabit gear I was just going to
[3605.40 → 3609.56] actually say I wonder if you just got close enough that you could have like an access point or a
[3609.56 → 3616.04] repeater grab their Wi-Fi send it to a landline and then like shoot it to your house um try to feed off
[3616.04 → 3621.08] of like Google's internet not that you should ever do that I don't condone anything that I just said
[3621.08 → 3627.40] fairly sure that breaks at least several laws yep so but anyway back to the thing that we could do
[3627.40 → 3634.28] that would be legal not a good plan is this gear is capable of like 40 kilometre links I don't know
[3634.28 → 3639.88] if you can get full gigabit with a 40 kilometre link, but there are a couple different ways we're going
[3639.88 → 3645.32] to try and tackle it we're either going to do like a moving vlog like a project vlog style thing
[3645.32 → 3652.04] where we try and get a gigabit link to my house from the office which I would absolutely love and
[3652.04 → 3656.76] would be awesome I'll just I'll keep I don't think that's going to work I don't think it's gonna work
[3656.76 → 3662.44] either just because of like we'd have to get really high obstructions yeah like physically high because
[3662.44 → 3668.36] of obstructions like like like up vertical like mine crafted yeah like this isn't really with that
[3668.36 → 3673.88] said I am on the strata council oh my god our neighbour hold on just hold on just hold on just
[3673.88 → 3677.08] just bear with me what about your house hold on you just want to go high enough that you
[3677.08 → 3682.12] can like to angle it down okay just just wait calm down for a second okay I'm on the strata council
[3682.84 → 3689.56] our neighbour our BA neighbour who's like besties he's on the strata council I'd be like I'd be like yo
[3689.56 → 3695.40] dog can you vote with me on this I want to put a giant antenna on top of our unit he'd be like yeah
[3695.40 → 3700.44] whatever man you just offer it yeah to be fair he would and two if you were like if you buy the equipment
[3700.44 → 3705.56] I can put one up for you too he'd be super down so so yeah so it's like it's like he's a cool
[3705.56 → 3712.20] guy yeah and there's a tree near my house that is like pretty tall and I'm pretty sure you're not
[3712.20 → 3717.64] allowed to do this I was going to say is it yours no, but it's really close to my house the antenna green
[3717.64 → 3723.40] yeah yeah I've got camo I mean don't listen to me, I've got I've got camo duct tape dog so
[3723.40 → 3725.40] oh my god there you go
[3728.12 → 3733.96] so if it can be done we're either going to do that or if that's just a total disaster and isn't going
[3733.96 → 3738.36] to happen yeah we can't get approval or whatever else you've heard of like pirate radio stuff right
[3739.16 → 3745.00] yeah oh yeah oh yeah then my parents live on the 39th floor or something of a high-rise
[3746.04 → 3750.12] so I'm going to put a unit up there and I'm going to try and get a link to like my house or something
[3750.12 → 3754.84] oh my god so that's the backup plan make your own giant local network it's going to be freaking
[3754.84 → 3761.08] awesome one way or another I'm super stoked uh we did get two units but one of them is not one of
[3761.08 → 3764.36] them is like the consumer grade one so I don't know if it's going to do that long of a link
[3765.96 → 3773.88] anyway um so it'd be super cool that's gonna I'm so I am so down for a gigabit link to the office
[3773.88 → 3781.00] so yeah this is pretty cool this was posted on the forum by kames I'm sorry we've been terrible
[3781.00 → 3787.80] about that lately someone in the chat just says uh just said where I work uses this a lot that's cool
[3787.80 → 3794.04] it's cool stuff I'm assuming it's either shorter and or clearer runs though yep, or they're going like
[3794.76 → 3800.20] or they have access to towers and permission to use them yeah yeah because that's what this gear is used
[3800.20 → 3806.28] for a lot of the time is for like uh mobile internet service providers um like cellular data
[3806.28 → 3810.20] carriers is they're going to have these on their towers so they'll have point to point links all
[3810.20 → 3816.84] over the place like if you look at a cell tower it's going to have like tons of dishes on it so um so
[3816.84 → 3821.48] one of the ones that we got is like kind of consumer grade one that's actually fairly affordable
[3821.48 → 3826.68] and could be great for if you have like a back shed or a barn or something super cool solution we might
[3826.68 → 3831.24] do a separate video about that there was a guy that I knew in high school now keep in mind this
[3831.24 → 3834.92] sounds like a huge amount of property but where I went to high school is pretty far out and then
[3834.92 → 3842.68] where they lived was like beyond that, so this is like deep in Farmville um a real farm game yeah so
[3842.68 → 3847.88] like way back on his property like pretty far there was this giant building where they did metal
[3847.88 → 3853.16] fabrication I did a website for them when I was in high school um would have been super
[3853.16 → 3860.44] helpful for them, it wasn't very good second troll it wasn't very good oh damn um that probably would
[3860.44 → 3865.00] have helped them a lot because they had to run this like terrible I think they had a dedicated
[3865.00 → 3869.80] internet line for that building because switching it was like not a good option and all this kind of
[3869.80 → 3875.08] stuff right so if they could have just done that that would have been super great um anyway so the
[3875.08 → 3880.92] other unit we're getting is like a carrier grade one so uh that's the one that will be running
[3880.92 → 3886.68] to my house because I'm the boss if uh is we end up doing this look at this guy look at this guy
[3887.40 → 3895.16] shaking his head I am terrible all right so lets uh go ahead meet the android phone with a humongous
[3895.16 → 3900.28] 10 000 William hour battery now to be clear I'm giving apple crap see one year if you can just you
[3900.28 → 3903.88] know how you got your parents the Sonos thing yeah you should see if you can just cover all of your
[3903.88 → 3910.76] present needs with your gifting present with like samples like your own so i just
[3912.60 → 3917.56] so the entire month of December should be presents for Linus and his family and his friends
[3917.56 → 3921.96] and his employees is that where you're getting at with I wasn't actually, but that works
[3923.96 → 3929.40] um okay so to be clear I'm giving apple crap for shipping 1800 William hour batteries in their
[3929.40 → 3934.84] flagship like thousand dollar devices but I'm also not saying that this is necessarily the solution
[3934.84 → 3940.28] I think apple's battery should be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3000 to 30 200 William hours
[3940.28 → 3945.24] that would get you through an actual heavy use state where you actually want to navigate somewhere
[3945.88 → 3951.40] this is pretty extreme it oh there's not that many pictures that's what I mean like I was trying to
[3951.40 → 3955.72] look this up all I can really tell is that it looks like it's kind of from the 90s no, no there's
[3955.72 → 3959.64] I found more pictures of it somewhere else this uh article just doesn't have a lot of i couldn't
[3959.64 → 3964.68] find any thickness pictures because if it's not that insanely thick, and it happens to have 10 000
[3964.68 → 3969.72] million powers on it, I did it's pretty it's thicker than a droid turbo like it's pretty it's pretty hefty
[3969.72 → 3974.60] the thing that the thing that actually both bothers me about it though and is also really cool about it
[3974.60 → 3980.68] is that I wouldn't want to use it because the specs for it are quite low, and it's using like one gigahertz
[3980.68 → 3987.08] media tech quad-core or something like that um 16 gigs of like total overall storage memory yeah
[3987.08 → 3993.48] it's not very good it is expandable uh 720p display five and a half inch uh display two gigs ram like
[3993.48 → 4001.00] it's its very not amazing but what's cool about that is that a 10 000 William hour battery it's gonna
[4001.00 → 4007.16] power that forever like you would actually probably be able to go about a week on this thing seriously
[4007.16 → 4012.84] uh it supports 4g LTE on both of its sim card slots so it actually looks pretty interesting
[4012.84 → 4017.40] um with that said I'm not I'm not running out to buy one either I don't know why I'm doing this but
[4017.40 → 4021.48] someone in the chat said help I can't get above 60 fps and fallout 4 try turning off v-sync that's
[4021.48 → 4028.68] probably your problem okay let's continue okay Spotify is reportedly considering making some music
[4028.68 → 4038.04] available only to paid users so um yeah so that it'll be like kind of windowed thing that'll
[4038.04 → 4043.32] withhold certain albums from users who aren't paying who are accessing the service freely and
[4043.32 → 4050.52] purely ad supported so about Spotify has roughly 80 million users 20 million who pay and 60 million who
[4050.52 → 4056.36] don't and the Wall Street journal reported that Spotify will test this new approach Spotify did comment
[4056.36 → 4061.96] we are 100 committed to our model because we believe that a free ad supported tier combined
[4061.96 → 4066.60] with a more robust premium tier is the best way to deliver music to fans create value for artists
[4066.60 → 4071.08] and songwriters and grow the industry in that context we explored a wide range of promotional
[4071.08 → 4075.80] options for the new Coldplay album and ultimately decided together with management that Coldplay and
[4075.80 → 4081.16] its fans would be best served with the full album on both free and premium this Friday so
[4081.16 → 4087.96] they're still committed to doing it the way they were going to do if it's okay um, but that doesn't
[4087.96 → 4091.88] mean that they aren't going to experiment with different monetization models because that's the
[4091.88 → 4097.88] thing that the digital age allows us to do which is kind of cool is done things that are new and different
[4097.88 → 4104.52] and give consumers choice I am not going to hate on them for this and uh yeah I mean I'm ultimately glad
[4104.52 → 4109.24] that they're still doing the free ad supported model even though I personally pay for my music streaming
[4109.24 → 4112.60] service because I really don't want to listen to ads in it and I plan to subscribe to YouTube red as
[4112.60 → 4117.56] soon as I possibly can and all of that stuff which who knows I really hope it comes to Canada soon
[4119.40 → 4123.16] but uh there you go it was maybe going to happen, and then it didn't happen and speaking of things
[4123.16 → 4128.36] that were maybe going to happen and didn't happen Firefox phone Mozilla has killed the Firefox phone
[4128.36 → 4136.04] with that said they are not writing off the Firefox OS, and we could see it pop up in other devices in
[4136.04 → 4141.72] the future so Mozilla said to TechCrunch well we weren't able to offer the best user experience
[4141.72 → 4150.04] possible so asked it which is a responsible thing to do yep and I guess that's pretty much all I have
[4150.04 → 4154.92] to say for today yeah I don't know I think that's good oh actually no I have one more thing to hate on
[4155.80 → 4161.72] yep stick around for the hate this is that thing that I teased before that wasn't oh yeah I know nothing
[4161.72 → 4166.92] about this yeah that's fine it's really easy this is the most amazing thing that I've seen to date
[4167.72 → 4176.76] get this imagine this oh a pocket pc as portable and light as a smartphone yet as powerful as a
[4176.76 → 4184.36] desktop pc you can back it now on Indiegogo I would love to see what their Indiegogo page looks like
[4184.36 → 4192.12] where really learn more click the join button I'm in an endless loop join that one there we go
[4195.08 → 4203.72] why have they raised three hundred thousand dollars is it flex oh it's done is it done oh yeah
[4203.72 → 4213.64] so they're done original campaign was 2945 funded okay so whoops okay back to the back to
[4213.64 → 4222.36] the site you shouldn't be allowed to say something this asinine on the internet let's just let's just
[4222.36 → 4228.76] restrict that there internet okay I'm with Mr Trump on this free speech bro so it's portable no but this
[4228.76 → 4234.92] is false advertising it's a completely different thing well yeah I don't know what it is okay well
[4236.52 → 4242.92] it's portable it's got superfast storage the flash storage is much faster than regular commonly used
[4242.92 → 4250.76] 5400 rpm hard disks it is silent it is intel powered combined with two gigs of ram and an
[4250.76 → 4255.40] intel high definition graphics card you shouldn't be allowed to call onboard graphics a graphics card
[4255.40 → 4260.76] by the way it's not on a card it is especially not on a card because you could make the argument that a
[4260.76 → 4266.76] motherboard is just a big card back in the days when the GPU was on the north bridge it is especially
[4266.76 → 4273.96] not a card now that it's on die with a superfast 2.4 and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi card also oh that probably
[4273.96 → 4279.32] is a card and integrated Bluetooth 4.0 you can connect to devices within the blink of an eye and browse and
[4279.32 → 4284.76] watch online videos possessive should have probably spell checked I mean I try not to be a nitpicky
[4284.76 → 4289.64] person about that kind of stuff if you're not being a complete asshole, but that's not what's happening here
[4289.64 → 4297.08] quicker than ever before is it in this next picture uh not really that's it so that's the pc
[4298.36 → 4305.56] quad-core intel atom bay trail okay, so a bay trail is not a desktop processor this is not faster than a
[4305.56 → 4311.32] desktop processor and while it isn't bigger than a phone it also isn't more than a phone it's just a
[4311.32 → 4320.60] phone also intel has much more powerful pcs that are exactly the same size or very similar and if
[4320.60 → 4325.64] maybe a little bit bigger like a little bit yeah the nut is thicker yeah it's not as long though but
[4325.64 → 4332.28] gigabyte has bricks ones that are thinner if I recall correctly so um yeah, so this is a thing that totally
[4332.28 → 4337.48] exists there's also the intel compute stick yep which is smaller than this and I believe way more
[4337.48 → 4341.08] usable I don't remember if it's a quad or a dual-core though so probably not as fast but like
[4341.80 → 4347.00] what are you going to do on this that you can't do anything sick one HDMI output why are we funding
[4347.00 → 4354.76] this this is stuff that exists already this is and like the thing that really makes me mad
[4354.76 → 4360.28] is not that it's a tiny computer that's fine let me see a pocket pc as portable and light as a
[4360.28 → 4367.24] smartphone yet as powerful as a desktop pc come on the superfast quad-core it's literally this
[4367.24 → 4371.72] the slowest quad-core they make the superfast quad-core intel processor ensures you have enough power
[4371.72 → 4376.60] to use seriously for any task people in chatter claiming that the compute stick is a quad-core
[4376.60 → 4380.76] yeah i think it might be I don't I did the video I should probably know but I don't remember
[4380.76 → 4384.44] yeah, but we don't always remember everything that we uh everything that we make a video about we make
[4384.44 → 4389.32] a video literally every day but like the compute stick was usable, and it's kind of an interesting form
[4389.32 → 4393.88] factor, and you can plug it directly into a monitor and like but what it isn't is as powerful as a
[4393.88 → 4401.96] desktop no, but that wasn't the point yes whereas this that's my issue yeah is they're just being
[4401.96 → 4411.00] ass hats about the whole thing so uh yeah I guess that's pretty much all I have to say about that
[4411.00 → 4418.20] there it is there's the serious b so if your see is just probably what total does yep
[4418.20 → 4426.28] so are both of those probably yeah with that said if they have a nice I'd like I can see them having
[4426.28 → 4430.12] a place but i just I hate it when you're misrepresenting what it is entirely it's like it's
[4430.12 → 4434.28] no bigger or heavier than a smartphone well yeah that's because it basically is a smartphone without
[4434.28 → 4441.56] a screen or a battery I could make a smartphone that's well okay I personally couldn't, but you could
[4441.56 → 4445.72] take a smartphone I could take a smartphone take the battery and screen off of it there you go
[4446.68 → 4454.76] business model oh wow sell the screens as replacement screens for people they need to fix their phones
[4454.76 → 4458.52] sell the batteries for replacing batteries for people they need to fix their phones sell the
[4458.52 → 4464.20] inside for more by claiming it's more than it is oh wow all right well thank you for watching the
[4464.20 → 4471.08] land show we will see you guys again next week same bat time same bat channel I'm going to stream
[4471.08 → 4471.80] tonight k bye
[4476.68 → 4477.00] are you
[4478.52 → 4479.64] twitch give you a couple of bucks
[4484.68 → 4486.60] I don't know what's going on I don't know why people are watching
[4488.04 → 4491.40] I mean I know why they watch our videos are great I just don't know why they stop watching
[4494.52 → 4494.92] I guess
[4501.08 → 4505.96] is it wrong that i just kind of take for granted that people should watch our content, and it's amazing
[4506.68 → 4515.16] uh I think we've had good content lately I think so too I don't know like I don't know
[4515.16 → 4519.32] because we can hear you I know yeah we know you know you guys are cool you guys are like
[4519.32 → 4523.00] inner sanctum you stuck around until after the outro yeah actually this is pretty much everyone
[4523.00 → 4527.72] it seems like no one really tunes out until after the I think it's because we've made a habit of just
[4527.72 → 4533.72] we don't stop talking right because we do that like every yeah but I blame you yeah that's probably
[4533.72 → 4547.32] better yeah what they can't do is seen us we could be making out right now for all they know
[4547.32 → 4547.40] you
