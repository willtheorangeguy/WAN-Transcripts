[0.00 → 7.64] Okay, so new plan. We renamed the show to third time's a charm.
[8.00 → 8.30] Yes.
[8.44 → 10.54] And this is what happened last time, folks.
[11.46 → 17.32] I unplugged my headphones from the audio device on the microphone and BAM!
[17.96 → 20.40] USB-B connection. Gone.
[21.18 → 22.46] Fell out of the bottom.
[22.46 → 29.86] So we've used an innovative strategy called the Velcro it until you can put some tuck tape on it approach.
[30.00 → 31.58] I don't know if I want to touch it right now.
[31.66 → 38.76] And hopefully everything is fine from now until forever.
[39.44 → 40.90] Now until forever.
[41.24 → 43.14] We already established this isn't real wood.
[43.64 → 44.42] It's not wood?
[44.54 → 45.00] Isn't it?
[45.98 → 49.48] Well, it feels like wood, and it tastes like wood.
[49.48 → 51.26] Remember last time I carried it in the table?
[51.36 → 52.88] So it probably is wood.
[52.96 → 53.88] Wait, you tasted it?
[55.20 → 56.70] Wouldn't you have just tasted the paint?
[57.16 → 58.12] I guess so.
[58.12 → 61.08] No, no. I think it's like particle board or something.
[61.16 → 62.54] No, we have a real wood table.
[62.70 → 66.54] But the table can change without us really messing up much of anything else.
[67.32 → 68.24] I just meant for your knock.
[69.06 → 70.82] So basically, we...
[70.82 → 72.46] Well, strictly speaking...
[72.46 → 76.40] If you have a painted or even, for that matter, sealed table, does it still count?
[76.46 → 79.50] Because you would be knocking on the paint, not knocking on the wood.
[79.64 → 82.98] Yeah, but I think it's kind of like the crater effect.
[82.98 → 85.02] Like, if a meteorite hits a thing...
[85.02 → 87.12] So the vibration from your knock goes through the thing.
[87.12 → 88.20] The thing hits the other thing.
[88.30 → 90.24] We still say the meteor caused the crater.
[90.36 → 92.94] We don't say that this particular ring of dust specks...
[92.94 → 94.84] The dispersion of the other things created it.
[94.88 → 95.04] Yes.
[95.18 → 95.58] Exactly.
[95.68 → 96.00] Exactly.
[96.04 → 97.12] It's a chain reaction.
[97.50 → 97.74] Yes.
[97.80 → 97.96] All right.
[98.00 → 102.90] So on the subject of chains, what have we got for topics today?
[102.90 → 103.60] We have the Google event.
[103.82 → 105.28] So a bunch of stuff was launched there.
[105.36 → 106.50] Some pretty interesting things.
[106.72 → 107.28] The Google.
[107.82 → 108.44] The Google event.
[108.44 → 109.20] The Google event.
[109.20 → 110.26] The one and only Google.
[110.54 → 113.62] PC is no longer the number one gaming platform for children.
[113.92 → 114.36] Wrecked.
[114.36 → 115.18] I hate you.
[115.44 → 115.84] Wrecked.
[115.94 → 116.62] I hate you.
[116.62 → 117.34] What, Justin?
[117.80 → 119.46] Sounds off by a little bit, just so you know.
[119.72 → 119.98] What?
[120.24 → 120.80] The timing.
[121.00 → 121.50] It's off by a little bit.
[121.62 → 122.40] It needs a delay.
[122.68 → 124.30] So delay it by just a little bit.
[124.64 → 125.96] Oh, I can't remember.
[126.08 → 126.80] I did this last week.
[126.80 → 127.60] I thought it was 50.
[128.08 → 129.54] Yeah, I thought it was like 50 milliseconds.
[129.54 → 129.88] That's speakers.
[130.28 → 132.14] Yeah, it shouldn't take too much.
[132.26 → 133.86] Maybe 50 or 100.
[134.26 → 134.96] Yeah, okay.
[134.96 → 137.58] I did 50 last week, and apparently it was fine, so.
[138.54 → 140.88] We also have Yelp for human beings.
[141.18 → 142.26] So you can now rate people.
[142.36 → 144.08] I'm basically just going to do all the intro topics.
[144.08 → 144.80] You're not going to let me do anything.
[146.98 → 152.44] Also, T-Mobile customers were exposed in a major data breach.
[153.12 → 156.12] So without further ado, the intro.
[164.96 → 193.02] Oh, crap.
[193.02 → 198.80] I knew I missed something.
[199.04 → 203.02] I was like waiting for the intro to go away, and I was going to be like, yeah, high five.
[203.10 → 203.84] We did it right.
[206.74 → 207.52] Oh, dude.
[207.62 → 210.58] So I figured out why the intro doesn't work.
[210.66 → 215.74] Because I've been using the microphone's audio device as system sound.
[215.74 → 218.28] And then I've been telling the intro to play on system sound.
[218.34 → 223.56] But I've had to mute system sound in order to keep the mic from having an echo.
[223.76 → 225.72] Because it automatically monitors itself.
[225.72 → 227.42] The problem hasn't been the audio the whole time.
[227.42 → 228.96] No, the intro audio worked.
[229.40 → 231.72] Now, you know how sometimes the intro, the audio doesn't work?
[232.16 → 234.64] Yeah, but the big problem is that the intro video wouldn't play.
[234.72 → 236.06] Oh, yeah, that too.
[236.18 → 237.88] No, no, I think that's resolved.
[237.94 → 238.62] That's fixed with the reformat.
[238.62 → 240.06] And reformatted the machine.
[240.18 → 240.34] Yeah.
[240.56 → 243.58] Because that was one worked Windows installation.
[243.74 → 245.14] It was bad.
[245.40 → 248.44] To be fair, the new one's still having issues because of Black Magic cards.
[248.70 → 250.74] But I think I've got that now.
[251.22 → 252.48] I think it's okay now.
[252.58 → 252.82] Okay.
[252.84 → 253.64] Like, I think we're good.
[253.90 → 256.28] I actually, I don't know what caused the problem.
[257.30 → 258.92] But it hasn't happened again.
[259.84 → 262.76] It's that thing where you change so many things, and it just starts working.
[262.92 → 263.94] And people are like, how did you fix it?
[263.96 → 266.06] And you're like, I don't know.
[266.56 → 267.56] But it's done.
[268.26 → 268.96] I think.
[269.24 → 269.50] Yeah.
[270.00 → 272.76] Because it's one of those things where that, honestly, that's the worst.
[272.86 → 274.72] When you don't know what you did to fix it.
[274.72 → 274.80] Yeah.
[275.28 → 278.88] Because that means it could come back at any moment.
[279.12 → 280.34] And you wouldn't know why.
[280.50 → 283.90] And you'd have to do all the 25 freaking things you did last time.
[284.24 → 286.08] Just to have a chance of fixing it again.
[286.16 → 286.50] Yes.
[286.74 → 286.96] Yeah.
[287.28 → 288.56] It's like, what chance?
[288.56 → 293.28] So the sponsors that were supposed to go on that overlay thing right there.
[293.38 → 293.50] Yeah.
[293.62 → 298.46] Lynda.com, Squarespace, and Tunnel Bear would have normally had spots.
[298.56 → 304.46] But instead, let's jump right into the show and get into our first freaking topic here.
[304.58 → 306.70] And this is quite the topic.
[306.90 → 308.80] The original article here is from NDP.
[309.12 → 309.70] Oh, excuse me.
[309.76 → 310.14] NDP.
[310.64 → 310.98] Sorry.
[311.10 → 313.32] I got Canadian elections on the mind here.
[313.32 → 314.18] It's a big deal.
[314.24 → 315.40] NPD.com.
[315.46 → 316.62] Are you dropping this in me yet?
[316.62 → 319.18] You are dropping it all over the place, yo.
[319.18 → 319.88] I get into our first freaking topic here.
[319.88 → 320.66] So NPD.
[320.88 → 327.02] Kids move away from home computers for gaming in droves.
[327.14 → 328.84] In the least surprising news of me.
[328.84 → 331.02] Well, okay.
[331.24 → 331.64] You know what?
[331.72 → 336.16] I will let you go kind of through what we've got in terms of facts here.
[336.16 → 341.70] Largely what they're talking about is that the kids have moved towards mobile devices, which
[341.70 → 343.22] is not surprising.
[343.46 → 346.90] There's the classic thing like, oh, do you have games on your phone?
[347.34 → 351.72] Like the question that you get from your little nephew or niece at like every single
[351.72 → 352.72] family gathering ever.
[352.72 → 357.86] It's not surprising because it's very easy for mom or dad to just have a game on their phone
[357.86 → 359.24] and be like, here, play with this.
[359.30 → 360.34] I need to do something.
[361.22 → 365.98] One of the things that this report is actually talking about is that the amount of kids,
[366.12 → 370.12] like the percentage of kids that are playing games on mobile phones hasn't actually really
[370.12 → 370.60] increased.
[370.60 → 375.12] But the amount of time that they've spent playing games on mobile phones has increased
[375.12 → 375.90] by quite a bit.
[375.90 → 380.22] I mean, here, here's a couple of, okay, no, I'll, I'll let you, I'll let you, I'm gonna
[380.22 → 380.98] let you finish.
[381.16 → 381.84] I'm going to let you finish.
[382.08 → 382.32] Okay.
[382.44 → 388.52] Portable consoles remain popular in the age nine to 11 group with about 41% of that, of
[388.52 → 391.18] people in that age group playing those games.
[391.74 → 398.48] 45% of kids age two to 17 are gaming on a home computer down 22% since 2013.
[398.68 → 400.94] So that's actually changed a lot.
[401.98 → 403.02] That's pretty surprising.
[403.02 → 410.28] But I don't think as many kid games are coming out right now for PC compared to before.
[410.28 → 411.34] That's an interesting point.
[411.44 → 415.46] I didn't even think about that because I, I, I had some other factors in my mind that
[415.46 → 417.10] I thought were probably contributing to this.
[417.18 → 421.60] But now that I think about it, I mean, okay, it's also possible that you and I just aren't
[421.60 → 423.18] really exposed to kids games.
[423.18 → 425.40] This is why I said that and then looked directly at you.
[425.40 → 426.60] The ways that we used to be.
[426.74 → 427.00] Yeah.
[427.14 → 430.70] Because like, I don't, I can't even think of where to buy kids games.
[430.76 → 432.14] Like I'm sure they have them on Steam.
[432.14 → 434.84] You can, you can often get them at like the big box store stuff.
[435.00 → 436.22] Like a big box store.
[436.58 → 436.90] Ooh.
[437.22 → 438.26] A big box store.
[438.32 → 438.68] Oh, burn.
[439.12 → 445.06] Um, I remember like, I think Staples and Best Buy and stuff will have like the Leapfrog.
[445.84 → 448.08] Is that really a PC game?
[449.10 → 451.14] Because they usually try and sell their own stupid.
[452.04 → 452.54] Oh, I see.
[452.74 → 455.24] This is, this was back when I was working there though.
[455.28 → 456.18] So this has been a while.
[456.22 → 456.48] Yeah.
[456.66 → 458.04] It's kind of like five years ago.
[458.04 → 460.02] No, I know, but that's from 2013.
[460.18 → 462.30] So that's a little bit after I was working there.
[462.30 → 463.78] So like, it's still within the realm.
[463.78 → 467.92] But I'm just trying to think like when I was shopping for a game as a kid, it was like,
[468.00 → 472.78] I mean, you kind of look at how the demographics of gaming have changed as the kids who grew
[472.78 → 473.84] up playing video games.
[473.90 → 474.06] Hello.
[474.38 → 474.50] Yeah.
[474.60 → 478.50] Um, became adults and oh, it turns out games aren't just, you know, kid crap.
[478.50 → 482.50] It turns out that when you grow up playing video games, you might still play video games.
[482.66 → 482.76] Yeah.
[482.76 → 488.00] Um, to be fair though, even when I was growing up for kids games that like basically what
[488.00 → 491.60] I'm going to put under kids games is like stuff that my mom would let me get when I was in
[491.60 → 492.52] these kinds of age groups.
[492.64 → 495.36] A lot of them were mobile or console stuff.
[495.58 → 496.44] A lot of it was Nintendo.
[497.68 → 498.08] Right.
[498.36 → 503.42] And Nintendo has been like kind of not really wanting to go towards mobile stuff, whether
[503.42 → 504.66] or not you think that's a good idea.
[504.66 → 504.82] Yeah.
[504.82 → 508.38] But other people have been going into the mobile space really heavily for kids games.
[508.76 → 512.02] So kids games already not being super huge on PC.
[512.02 → 512.46] Yeah.
[512.46 → 512.92] To be completely honest.
[513.02 → 516.20] I remember like, like kickstart and all this kind of stuff when I was a kid.
[516.28 → 516.40] Yeah.
[516.50 → 520.10] Dino Park Tycoon and Oregon Trail and all that, all that kind of crap.
[520.20 → 520.30] Yeah.
[520.32 → 525.24] Like you could, you could go and shop for PC games as a kid and there would be like tons
[525.24 → 525.70] of options.
[525.70 → 529.80] And then for like the really sort of adult oriented stuff, there'd be like leisure suit
[529.80 → 531.72] Larry, like on a high up shelf somewhere.
[532.02 → 535.56] And yeah, you know, or you'd have liked your, you know, when I was, I guess I would have been
[535.56 → 536.82] in my teens at this point.
[536.82 → 539.56] So stuff like, you know, your Never winter Nights, Never winter Nights 2.
[539.78 → 539.86] Oh yeah.
[539.86 → 540.46] Awesome games.
[540.46 → 545.12] So, so, so all this stuff existed, but there was an awful lot that was very kid friendly.
[545.32 → 545.98] Whereas now.
[546.50 → 547.72] And now, and now like, what do you do?
[547.80 → 549.58] You, you, a lot, I know a lot of people.
[549.74 → 551.56] Jetpack Joyride even exists for the PC?
[552.14 → 552.84] I don't know.
[553.06 → 554.02] Unless it's like Flash or whatever.
[554.02 → 555.28] It's probably in the Windows store.
[555.34 → 555.88] I bet it is.
[555.92 → 556.34] There you go.
[556.38 → 556.50] Yeah.
[556.58 → 557.98] I'm going to check the Windows store.
[557.98 → 562.56] Like, like, like, okay, to be completely fair with some of the stuff on Steam, with kids
[562.56 → 566.00] in a certain age group, I don't even know if I'd necessarily want them seeing the Steam
[566.00 → 566.56] store.
[567.10 → 570.14] Just because of the stuff that might go through the sale page.
[570.30 → 570.50] Yep.
[570.50 → 576.84] So, like, I could understand a kid not having Steam, and with the vast majority of PC stuff
[576.84 → 579.66] happening on Steam these days, I don't know.
[580.28 → 581.00] I kind of get it.
[581.04 → 582.74] I'm not super surprised by this statistic.
[582.74 → 588.94] There were a couple other comments that I had here that were sort of unrelated to that.
[589.02 → 592.18] So, number one is, oh, oh yeah, okay.
[592.26 → 597.18] So, number one is, now that I have kids, I get to make all these, like, observations about
[597.18 → 600.04] children and seem insightful, but actually, I just have no choice.
[600.12 → 602.16] You have to supervise them, or they'll kill themselves.
[603.46 → 603.86] So.
[604.18 → 604.96] Human babies.
[605.92 → 607.06] They're so crap.
[607.16 → 608.94] Mimicking parents is a huge factor.
[608.94 → 615.16] And the article actually brings this up, is that mom and dad are likely performing a
[615.16 → 619.10] lot of tasks on their phones now that they would have traditionally had to do on a computer.
[619.76 → 622.30] And junior or Juliette or whatever.
[623.22 → 623.66] Juliette?
[623.72 → 624.38] What's the equivalent?
[624.84 → 625.64] I don't think there is one.
[625.70 → 627.78] Isn't junior just, isn't that?
[628.02 → 630.66] No, I don't think you use junior for a female.
[630.88 → 635.74] I think it's commonly used as a male thing, but is junior actually not gender-neutral?
[636.02 → 636.84] I don't think so.
[636.84 → 638.52] But junior just, like.
[638.52 → 640.92] Because no one names their daughter after their mom.
[641.12 → 642.96] I have literally never heard of that once.
[643.86 → 645.56] So, in order to be junior, you'd have to be.
[645.56 → 647.94] But you could be, like, a junior engineer.
[648.16 → 648.46] I mean.
[648.60 → 649.96] And that's a gender-neutral term.
[649.98 → 650.62] No, no, that is.
[650.72 → 652.42] But in terms of the name junior.
[653.14 → 655.10] Like, it's Indiana.
[655.76 → 658.96] It's Dr. Jones Senior, Dr. Jones Junior.
[659.14 → 659.80] Like, it's not.
[660.84 → 661.24] Yeah.
[662.06 → 663.52] No, I'm pretty sure it's gender-specific.
[663.52 → 665.52] Is that just because, like, no one does it?
[666.16 → 666.52] Perhaps.
[666.52 → 668.84] Or is that because it's actually gender-specific?
[668.98 → 675.70] Although, I mean, now that there are so many unisex names, you know, whether it's, you know, your Taylor or your Leslie or whatever else.
[676.20 → 680.60] In theory, assuming I had a unisex name, which Linus really isn't.
[680.60 → 689.72] Any name that actually has an alternate meaning in Urban Dictionary as, you know, male genitals probably will never be a unisex name.
[691.40 → 693.38] So, let's say my name was something appropriate.
[693.42 → 695.14] Does every guy's name reference that?
[695.18 → 695.94] Because mine does, too.
[696.64 → 696.94] On Urban Dictionary.
[696.94 → 697.50] You're Luke.
[698.68 → 699.80] No, not all.
[700.04 → 700.84] Well, no, it means.
[701.58 → 703.54] It's the first definition for mine, though.
[703.74 → 703.94] Yeah.
[703.94 → 705.42] Is yours even the first definition?
[705.56 → 706.46] Because it's just because it's like.
[706.64 → 708.66] No, it doesn't mean, like, that directly.
[708.90 → 710.04] It means a size of that.
[711.54 → 711.94] Wow.
[712.94 → 718.32] So, where I was going with this was I could technically name my daughter Linus Junior.
[719.24 → 719.58] Right.
[719.62 → 720.76] If my name were unisex.
[720.88 → 721.00] Right.
[721.00 → 721.56] And I guess.
[722.32 → 723.78] But people would assume they're a boy.
[724.42 → 724.82] For sure.
[725.18 → 725.46] Or just.
[725.46 → 725.78] Probably.
[725.78 → 727.10] Even just Junior would assume.
[727.22 → 730.00] Like, if your nickname is Junior, you would assume it's a boy.
[730.00 → 733.32] So, where was I going with this?
[733.40 → 733.50] Right.
[733.88 → 734.62] Mimicking parents.
[734.76 → 739.60] So, like, you know, my son and daughter are both phone whiz kids.
[739.98 → 741.82] Like, compared to their ages, of course.
[741.94 → 742.92] You know, my daughter's one.
[743.36 → 750.26] So, the fact that she, like, knows how to try to type in a passcode and, like, unlock things in open apps is kind of impressive.
[750.26 → 753.40] It means I spend too much time on my phone in front of her, for one thing.
[754.34 → 758.02] And they don't see me use the desktop computer nearly as much anymore.
[758.02 → 762.90] Because I've switched to almost entirely using my laptop or my phone whenever they're around.
[762.98 → 765.10] Because when do I have time to sit down at a desktop?
[765.62 → 765.74] Yeah.
[765.88 → 767.48] And then, number two.
[767.58 → 769.16] And I think this is actually.
[769.44 → 771.02] I don't think the article mentioned this.
[771.06 → 772.98] But I personally think this is a huge factor.
[773.48 → 775.08] Is hand-me-down phones.
[775.64 → 778.46] Because even three years ago.
[778.80 → 779.02] You know?
[779.02 → 779.64] Two years ago.
[779.72 → 780.14] Three years ago.
[780.24 → 780.84] Four years ago.
[780.94 → 781.76] Five years ago.
[781.76 → 783.02] Every year.
[783.20 → 790.80] The number of very capable, still very usable, hand-me-down mobile devices explodes.
[791.00 → 793.82] Because you look at the growth of how many of these devices are selling.
[794.34 → 796.74] And then there was that period where they all kind of sucked.
[797.20 → 798.30] Like, iPad 1.
[798.40 → 799.58] iPhone 3GS.
[800.04 → 801.88] Galaxy S1.
[802.04 → 803.84] Like, all that stuff was just kind of rubbish.
[803.84 → 814.04] But we're at the point now where anything from, I'd say, an iPhone 4 to iPhone 4S, Galaxy S3 or so and up, is still today.
[814.30 → 816.08] You know, a few years old device now.
[816.20 → 818.78] Is still a very usable device today.
[818.84 → 820.72] And there's no reason to throw it away.
[821.20 → 823.02] So, what would I do?
[823.12 → 826.58] Am I going to buy my kids the new iPhone, you know, 6S?
[826.74 → 827.20] No.
[827.74 → 832.08] Would I necessarily object to throwing them my old iPhone 4 to link around with?
[832.40 → 833.12] Probably not.
[833.12 → 838.60] So, I would imagine that compared to the investment of buying a mobile game console.
[838.70 → 841.84] Dedicated mobile game console with $60 games.
[842.86 → 846.64] I would imagine the inclination for parents is, oh, well, this thing's got lots of games on it.
[846.70 → 848.12] And I'm just sitting in a drawer anyway.
[848.20 → 848.60] Here you go.
[848.90 → 851.44] So, I think that's probably a huge factor there as well.
[852.54 → 853.48] Yeah, I would be surprised.
[853.64 → 855.94] Like, this is interesting.
[856.44 → 857.80] It's not like, oh, my God.
[857.82 → 860.80] I can't believe they're playing less PC games now.
[860.80 → 863.76] But it's still interesting.
[864.06 → 864.78] It's still interesting.
[865.02 → 866.76] It's just kind of what it is.
[866.76 → 871.82] Someone clarified, I haven't looked at Urban Dictionary in, like, a very long time.
[871.98 → 873.08] But apparently it's different now.
[873.90 → 875.20] Just in case you wanted to know.
[875.20 → 879.12] Oh, well, okay then.
[879.42 → 880.08] That's great.
[880.26 → 880.84] What's going on?
[881.52 → 882.20] I don't know.
[882.26 → 883.58] I'm just checking a thing.
[884.48 → 889.08] I actually, this is like a new version of XSplit that I haven't used recently.
[889.42 → 889.58] Yeah.
[889.58 → 892.10] And so someone's saying something about 24 FPS.
[892.38 → 894.64] And I really don't think it's running at 24 FPS.
[894.86 → 896.84] But I have actually no way of verifying that.
[897.68 → 898.52] You could.
[903.08 → 903.44] No.
[903.60 → 903.90] You know what?
[903.98 → 904.76] No, I know it's not.
[904.78 → 905.52] You can bring up the Flash properties.
[905.58 → 905.80] No, no.
[905.84 → 906.38] I know it's not.
[906.48 → 906.78] I'm sure.
[907.22 → 907.58] Okay.
[907.70 → 910.10] So let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here, shall we?
[910.22 → 910.60] Yes.
[911.04 → 912.00] Ah, yes.
[912.22 → 913.26] Spec reading event.
[913.44 → 914.02] The Google.
[914.02 → 921.62] Yeah, the reading of specifications for you exclusively here on the WAN Show.
[922.26 → 923.46] Except not exclusively.
[923.66 → 926.00] Yeah, except everyone and their dog has covered this.
[926.06 → 927.44] So let's try and blow through it pretty quick here.
[928.02 → 929.40] Next is 5X specs.
[929.56 → 936.34] 5.2 inch IPS LCD, 1920 by 1080, Corning Gorilla Grass 3, Snapdragon 808, 2 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM,
[936.44 → 941.34] stock Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Google Now on tap, 16 gigabytes and 32 gigabyte versions
[941.34 → 947.28] available, non-expandable, 12.3 megapixel dual LED flash camera, 2160p video capture,
[947.46 → 952.26] 5 megapixel selfie camera, fingerprint sensor on the back, USB type C, Android pay, Wi-Fi,
[952.38 → 958.06] 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, stereo speakers on the front with three microphones, 2700 William
[958.06 → 961.90] hour battery, black, white, and blue, different colours, ships in October, 16 gigabyte version
[961.90 → 965.16] cost $379, 32 gigabyte version cost $429.
[965.72 → 966.16] Bam!
[966.58 → 967.10] All right.
[968.42 → 968.86] Fascinating.
[969.00 → 969.58] Thanks for that.
[969.74 → 970.42] Great reporting.
[970.42 → 971.66] No problem.
[975.08 → 975.56] Right.
[975.68 → 977.88] There are some new features of Android 6.0.
[978.04 → 979.88] Faster access to voice activation.
[980.52 → 982.48] There's a charging speed indicator.
[983.06 → 984.12] Holy freaking crap.
[984.20 → 985.46] How did that take so long?
[985.60 → 985.70] Right.
[985.80 → 991.38] Do you know, when I was trying to do my video on Quick Charge 2.0, do you know what I had
[991.38 → 991.76] to do?
[992.58 → 993.76] Did I tell you what I had to do?
[993.80 → 993.96] No.
[994.12 → 995.14] Oh, it was ridiculous.
[995.14 → 996.14] It was ridiculous.
[996.14 → 1001.06] So I had to get all my different chargers, which by the way, everyone mislabels, false
[1001.06 → 1004.78] advertising all over the place on the output of chargers.
[1004.78 → 1012.84] That's what actually inspired that little ammeter that I got for USB ports that I showed on Handy Tech because they're all over the freaking map.
[1012.84 → 1016.74] So what I had to do was I had to get all these different chargers of each type.
[1016.84 → 1018.52] I had to charge the phone.
[1018.52 → 1022.56] So I had to get the phone down to like, I think it was like 2% because if I let it go below
[1022.56 → 1024.38] that, it would turn off.
[1024.54 → 1028.76] And then I would have to do a power on cycle while charging, which would affect the charging
[1028.76 → 1034.32] speed during the critical low battery time when it takes the best advantage of quick charging
[1034.32 → 1034.88] features.
[1035.14 → 1038.16] So I had to get it down to like 2% or 3% or something like that.
[1038.18 → 1041.12] So I had to be like sitting there watching it with a game running.
[1041.90 → 1043.02] Like, oh, we're getting there.
[1043.10 → 1043.56] We're getting there.
[1043.62 → 1043.80] Okay.
[1044.00 → 1044.22] Okay.
[1044.26 → 1044.86] Do something less.
[1045.04 → 1046.00] Turn off the flash now.
[1046.18 → 1046.98] Now just the game.
[1047.76 → 1048.04] Okay.
[1048.04 → 1048.94] Turn off the game.
[1049.20 → 1050.20] Now just max screen brightness.
[1050.30 → 1050.42] Okay.
[1050.46 → 1050.84] Screen brightness.
[1050.98 → 1051.14] Okay.
[1051.20 → 1051.48] We're there.
[1051.54 → 1051.78] We're there.
[1051.84 → 1052.00] Okay.
[1052.30 → 1052.64] Quick.
[1052.86 → 1053.44] Plug it in.
[1053.62 → 1055.54] Then I had to plug it in before it turned off.
[1055.64 → 1059.48] Then I just had to like set notification.
[1059.84 → 1064.28] I had to set timers to come back and check it periodically very quickly so I could turn it
[1064.28 → 1066.24] off right away so it could charge on its own.
[1066.78 → 1071.04] And then I had to just create Excel graphs out of my samples that I took.
[1071.04 → 1071.36] Oh my God.
[1071.46 → 1072.98] It was horrible.
[1073.10 → 1077.74] And all of this just to find out if these features were working.
[1077.74 → 1078.64] As intended.
[1079.54 → 1080.28] That's so ghetto.
[1080.48 → 1081.52] So now there's just an indicator.
[1081.66 → 1082.30] It makes sense.
[1082.42 → 1083.20] It's just very ghetto.
[1083.46 → 1083.60] Yeah.
[1084.08 → 1084.88] It worked.
[1085.12 → 1085.36] Yep.
[1085.68 → 1085.92] Yep.
[1086.20 → 1086.38] Yep.
[1086.74 → 1088.08] Faster scrolling and search.
[1088.32 → 1089.92] On device predictive app launching.
[1090.04 → 1091.34] So it learns your patterns and places.
[1092.02 → 1093.76] So goodbye aviate.
[1094.48 → 1094.74] Yeah.
[1094.86 → 1095.32] I guess.
[1095.78 → 1096.78] Runtime permissions.
[1097.06 → 1098.68] Less bloatware for the Nexus lineup.
[1099.48 → 1100.66] And that's good.
[1100.66 → 1101.38] So.
[1101.64 → 1103.84] Updates going to previous Nexus devices.
[1103.84 → 1104.08] Yeah.
[1104.08 → 1107.28] The 5, 6, 2013, 7 and the 9.
[1107.62 → 1108.14] What is it?
[1108.30 → 1108.86] Next week?
[1109.20 → 1109.36] Yep.
[1109.50 → 1110.14] Next week.
[1110.56 → 1112.02] So there you go.
[1112.12 → 1112.78] Everyone else.
[1112.90 → 1113.04] You know.
[1113.12 → 1114.82] Whether you got a Galaxy S6 active.
[1115.12 → 1116.68] Or a Droid Turbo.
[1118.14 → 1119.18] Screw you buddy.
[1119.18 → 1123.32] I love how they do that.
[1123.48 → 1123.80] I do too.
[1123.80 → 1124.82] It's just the worst.
[1125.74 → 1126.18] And it's like.
[1126.40 → 1127.18] It's all.
[1127.72 → 1129.26] It's not really all anyone's fault.
[1129.38 → 1130.90] It's all a lot of people's faults.
[1131.00 → 1132.00] It's all Google's fault.
[1132.24 → 1133.72] It's all the handset maker's fault.
[1133.82 → 1135.48] And it's especially all the carrier's fault.
[1136.06 → 1137.12] It's all of their faults.
[1137.34 → 1139.22] Just cut this crap out.
[1139.34 → 1140.42] Apple had the right idea.
[1141.08 → 1141.62] Let's just.
[1141.72 → 1143.82] Let's just all get on board.
[1143.94 → 1144.46] Oh cool.
[1144.54 → 1145.94] There's a music family plan.
[1145.94 → 1147.00] For 15 bucks a month.
[1147.08 → 1147.80] For up to 6 people.
[1148.48 → 1148.94] Oh my god.
[1148.94 → 1150.02] Can you do that?
[1150.22 → 1151.32] And then can I just.
[1151.46 → 1152.92] You are not a family member.
[1153.00 → 1153.52] Can I be?
[1154.00 → 1154.92] Can you adopt me?
[1156.04 → 1156.48] Wow.
[1157.36 → 1158.38] That's not awkward.
[1160.86 → 1161.30] Okay.
[1161.38 → 1161.98] First no.
[1162.42 → 1163.26] And then.
[1164.00 → 1165.34] But I want to Google Play.
[1165.58 → 1168.20] I want to save like $8 a month.
[1168.68 → 1169.56] It is kind of awesome.
[1169.72 → 1170.42] I kind of love it.
[1170.46 → 1172.44] I probably will upgrade to a family plan.
[1173.30 → 1176.86] So I guess nothing would prevent you from being part of my family at that point.
[1176.88 → 1177.32] Yay.
[1177.70 → 1178.10] Yay.
[1178.10 → 1179.02] If I mean.
[1179.10 → 1179.30] Okay.
[1179.36 → 1183.22] If I ever personally got like software license audited.
[1185.22 → 1186.06] Then I guess.
[1186.06 → 1186.54] That would be a little crazy.
[1186.56 → 1188.28] Who's this Luke Cafetière?
[1188.78 → 1189.76] Is he a relative of yours?
[1190.64 → 1192.28] Well he's got white skin like me.
[1192.56 → 1195.20] So we probably have a common ancestor somewhere.
[1195.86 → 1196.26] Eventually.
[1196.44 → 1197.44] If you go back far enough.
[1197.44 → 1200.44] You know also our Luke's are similar sizes.
[1200.44 → 1202.58] So you know.
[1203.06 → 1204.96] Probably a well-endowed ancestor.
[1205.12 → 1206.44] Probably did a lot of mating.
[1206.86 → 1208.06] On account of his you know.
[1210.48 → 1211.88] You want to see it?
[1212.82 → 1213.34] Wow.
[1213.50 → 1213.84] No.
[1213.92 → 1214.04] No.
[1214.08 → 1214.56] It's okay.
[1214.68 → 1215.64] The license is fine.
[1215.86 → 1217.82] The $14.99 is not worth it.
[1217.82 → 1222.94] Identity verification based on similarities of Luke's.
[1222.94 → 1223.50] Yeah.
[1224.94 → 1227.50] People are like what your name is actually Linus.
[1227.68 → 1228.20] Yes.
[1228.20 → 1232.46] I wish I'd had the foresight to adopt a screen name.
[1232.54 → 1233.70] I'd have gone with Dirk Digger.
[1239.46 → 1240.42] Oh my goodness.
[1240.42 → 1241.08] Oh terrible.
[1241.52 → 1242.00] Okay.
[1242.16 → 1244.44] So there's some Chromecast stuff.
[1245.40 → 1245.88] Finally.
[1246.04 → 1246.78] 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi.
[1246.88 → 1247.60] You know funny story.
[1248.26 → 1249.94] I have had my Chromecast.
[1250.04 → 1252.00] Sitting plugged into the back of my receiver.
[1252.66 → 1253.70] Since it came out.
[1255.18 → 1258.22] Because I didn't have a USB power port on my receiver.
[1258.72 → 1259.60] When I plugged it in.
[1259.64 → 1260.02] I was like.
[1260.16 → 1261.72] Oh I'll have to kind of deal with this later.
[1261.80 → 1264.62] And I just left the USB cable hanging out the back of my cabinet.
[1265.92 → 1267.50] I finally hooked it up.
[1267.50 → 1268.48] Two days ago.
[1272.38 → 1273.44] And I used it.
[1273.56 → 1274.02] And I was like.
[1274.02 → 1274.52] Oh yeah.
[1274.60 → 1276.28] This would have been cool to be using all this time.
[1276.28 → 1279.34] Because I actually changed out my receiver.
[1279.44 → 1280.34] So this is kind of funny.
[1281.02 → 1283.80] I posted this on Instagram a little while ago.
[1283.88 → 1287.12] LG sent over a 65-inch OLED TV.
[1287.82 → 1288.18] For.
[1288.62 → 1289.38] Not a review.
[1289.60 → 1290.68] I'm not going to call it a review.
[1290.80 → 1291.74] Because it's not what it's going to be.
[1291.82 → 1292.66] But it's going to be like.
[1293.64 → 1294.72] What is it like?
[1294.84 → 1296.56] Because this is state-of-the-art crap.
[1296.72 → 1297.74] It's curved.
[1298.18 → 1298.54] OLED.
[1300.10 → 1300.50] Huge.
[1300.94 → 1301.30] It's.
[1301.48 → 1301.72] Yeah.
[1301.78 → 1302.18] It's actually.
[1302.36 → 1303.52] It's kind of magnificent.
[1303.52 → 1304.74] The bezels are like this.
[1305.28 → 1305.80] I'm just like.
[1305.88 → 1306.22] Wow.
[1306.78 → 1309.66] It wouldn't even matter if it didn't have bezels at all.
[1309.86 → 1310.22] Because.
[1310.76 → 1312.26] Or if it had huge bezels even.
[1312.40 → 1315.30] Because the black of the black is the same as the black of the.
[1315.34 → 1315.54] Anyway.
[1317.58 → 1318.02] So.
[1318.50 → 1318.70] I.
[1318.82 → 1319.88] So I posted on Instagram.
[1320.02 → 1320.42] I was like.
[1320.72 → 1321.52] Great news.
[1321.84 → 1322.68] Awesome new TV.
[1323.34 → 1324.24] Terrible news.
[1324.44 → 1326.80] My receiver doesn't have HDMI 2.0.
[1326.90 → 1329.22] So I will be running at 1080p for now.
[1329.92 → 1331.74] So LG was actually like.
[1331.74 → 1332.06] Oh.
[1332.18 → 1332.42] Well.
[1332.78 → 1333.74] Just get a receiver.
[1333.74 → 1333.82] Sure.
[1334.24 → 1335.84] And we'll comp you for it.
[1335.92 → 1336.40] And I was like.
[1337.50 → 1337.86] Okay.
[1339.54 → 1339.86] Sure.
[1340.86 → 1341.46] So I was like.
[1341.52 → 1342.20] So I hooked that up.
[1342.26 → 1343.92] So that's why I was hooking up the Chromecast.
[1344.44 → 1344.90] And then.
[1345.14 → 1345.58] So yeah.
[1345.64 → 1346.64] Now apparently that's pointless.
[1346.76 → 1348.10] So there's a new antenna system.
[1348.90 → 1349.22] NBA.
[1349.22 → 1351.22] NHL and other partners coming in the fall.
[1351.36 → 1352.52] Sling TV will be available.
[1352.52 → 1353.58] If you're into that sort of thing.
[1353.64 → 1355.72] I don't think Sling is even supported in Canada.
[1355.90 → 1355.96] Is it?
[1355.96 → 1356.48] I don't think so.
[1356.56 → 1356.80] Yeah.
[1356.94 → 1357.20] So.
[1358.20 → 1358.52] Oh.
[1358.52 → 1358.92] Hooray.
[1358.92 → 1359.62] Canada.
[1360.34 → 1362.62] Your content is inferior.
[1363.18 → 1365.28] Although we do have some things on Netflix that you don't.
[1365.28 → 1365.30] But thankfully.
[1365.30 → 1368.18] You have lots of fresh water.
[1369.04 → 1369.44] Nestle.
[1370.28 → 1370.68] Nestle.
[1370.82 → 1371.16] No.
[1371.26 → 1372.14] Not Nestle water.
[1372.20 → 1373.74] I don't want to talk about Nestle water.
[1374.32 → 1374.70] It's like.
[1374.78 → 1375.34] We have to.
[1375.60 → 1375.96] I mean.
[1376.00 → 1376.80] A lot of the times.
[1377.00 → 1377.24] See.
[1377.24 → 1378.98] Now you're going to get me started on Nestle water.
[1379.42 → 1379.78] So.
[1380.30 → 1381.84] We have to get into this stuff.
[1381.94 → 1383.02] When it's actually like.
[1383.10 → 1383.48] Oh.
[1383.72 → 1384.46] Tech related.
[1384.98 → 1386.30] Because it's like.
[1388.02 → 1389.26] Because it's a tech show.
[1389.34 → 1391.36] But I try to avoid this kind of crap.
[1391.78 → 1392.50] When it is.
[1392.50 → 1393.62] When it's not tech related.
[1393.62 → 1393.96] So.
[1394.06 → 1394.78] So in a nutshell.
[1394.94 → 1395.38] Basically.
[1395.58 → 1396.40] Nestle figured.
[1396.92 → 1397.36] That.
[1397.74 → 1398.18] Well.
[1398.24 → 1398.70] Not Nestle.
[1398.80 → 1400.06] A particular person at Nestle.
[1400.12 → 1401.12] Although they're high up enough.
[1401.22 → 1402.84] That they can be considered a spokesperson.
[1403.36 → 1403.46] Yeah.
[1403.88 → 1404.66] Figured that.
[1404.70 → 1406.06] That water was not a right.
[1407.24 → 1411.80] And I forget what the word used was.
[1411.90 → 1414.08] But calling water not a human right.
[1414.20 → 1414.92] Is ridiculous.
[1415.52 → 1417.08] And people should have to pay for water.
[1417.26 → 1418.10] Was the other thing.
[1418.40 → 1420.08] And you know what I have to say to that Nestle.
[1420.48 → 1421.34] First.
[1421.80 → 1422.40] Screw you.
[1422.72 → 1423.72] And second of all.
[1423.84 → 1424.72] Your water sucks.
[1425.16 → 1425.36] Yeah.
[1425.48 → 1426.24] It's terrible.
[1427.04 → 1427.22] It's.
[1427.68 → 1428.54] Calling that.
[1428.94 → 1429.48] Spring water.
[1429.82 → 1429.96] Like.
[1430.08 → 1430.34] Okay.
[1430.40 → 1430.72] You guys.
[1430.84 → 1432.02] Even if you don't realize it.
[1432.06 → 1432.56] You've, probably.
[1432.56 → 1434.32] You've probably drank Nestle water.
[1434.32 → 1436.62] They're the ones that come in the bottles about.
[1436.90 → 1437.40] Yay big.
[1437.76 → 1438.00] Okay.
[1438.22 → 1439.54] They're like ribbed bottles.
[1439.68 → 1441.48] They have the really crappy.
[1441.48 → 1441.92] Clear.
[1442.10 → 1443.36] Translucent plastic top.
[1443.60 → 1444.86] They crinkle a lot.
[1444.96 → 1445.20] When you.
[1445.28 → 1445.62] When you.
[1445.72 → 1446.56] When you press on them.
[1446.78 → 1448.24] And they taste like pool water.
[1448.62 → 1450.38] That's how you can tell Nestle water.
[1450.44 → 1452.10] Because it tastes like.
[1452.24 → 1453.50] I went over to Luke's house.
[1454.06 → 1455.28] Dipped a cup in his pool.
[1455.28 → 1456.52] Right after.
[1456.76 → 1458.52] A fresh chlorination treatment.
[1459.24 → 1460.24] Dumped it in my.
[1460.42 → 1461.08] In my.
[1461.18 → 1461.40] You know.
[1461.54 → 1462.46] Flask or whatever.
[1462.68 → 1463.76] And chugged that stuff.
[1464.00 → 1464.28] Like a.
[1464.30 → 1465.10] Like a champion.
[1465.12 → 1465.72] And your flask.
[1465.84 → 1466.26] That's like.
[1466.44 → 1467.58] Already made of.
[1467.78 → 1469.36] The leakiest plastic ever.
[1469.56 → 1469.84] That's like.
[1469.86 → 1470.14] Yeah.
[1470.30 → 1470.74] Chemicals.
[1470.82 → 1470.94] Yeah.
[1471.20 → 1471.32] Yeah.
[1471.46 → 1471.68] Like.
[1471.78 → 1472.54] It's horrible.
[1473.08 → 1474.26] Most of the tap water.
[1474.32 → 1474.98] In the lower mainland.
[1475.18 → 1476.18] Is way better.
[1476.36 → 1477.16] Than that Nestle water.
[1477.84 → 1478.18] So.
[1479.00 → 1479.84] Get wrecked.
[1479.96 → 1480.34] Nestle.
[1481.22 → 1481.70] Um.
[1482.34 → 1483.34] The whole Twitch chat.
[1483.42 → 1484.54] Isn't even responding to really.
[1484.54 → 1485.30] What you were saying.
[1485.46 → 1486.00] They're all just like.
[1486.04 → 1486.80] Luke has a pool.
[1488.02 → 1488.92] I love you guys.
[1489.06 → 1489.42] Twitch chat.
[1490.12 → 1490.40] Ah.
[1490.44 → 1491.16] There's a new.
[1491.50 → 1492.42] Chromebook or something.
[1493.24 → 1494.02] The Chromecast audio.
[1494.18 → 1494.68] Is super cool.
[1494.98 → 1495.36] Oh yeah.
[1495.40 → 1496.08] Do you want to talk about that?
[1496.12 → 1497.02] So we can jump down.
[1497.16 → 1498.08] Where did it go?
[1498.86 → 1499.34] Way to go.
[1499.50 → 1499.84] There it is.
[1499.98 → 1500.98] So it's a different device.
[1501.16 → 1501.88] It's not, actually.
[1502.02 → 1503.64] Like built into the Chromecast.
[1503.64 → 1504.44] And actually.
[1504.66 → 1506.58] If you go to the article.
[1507.34 → 1507.70] Uh.
[1508.88 → 1510.42] The Android police article.
[1510.60 → 1511.56] Is that the one that's in there?
[1511.66 → 1511.84] Oh.
[1511.98 → 1512.16] Sorry.
[1512.24 → 1513.26] I don't think I ever, actually.
[1513.36 → 1513.76] Brought it up.
[1513.82 → 1514.06] My bad.
[1514.06 → 1514.54] I'll.
[1514.66 → 1515.28] Android central.
[1515.88 → 1517.54] I'll post a different one.
[1517.86 → 1518.24] Oh wait.
[1518.32 → 1518.68] Under.
[1519.24 → 1519.96] On the dock.
[1520.00 → 1520.12] Okay.
[1520.12 → 1520.60] Well whatever.
[1520.76 → 1521.38] Go to that.
[1521.70 → 1523.62] And then I'm going to post that in chat as well.
[1523.66 → 1524.30] Go to your face.
[1524.34 → 1526.14] Because I want to show everyone a picture.
[1526.66 → 1528.44] And see what you guys think about this.
[1528.66 → 1529.08] Go to.
[1529.30 → 1529.42] Yeah.
[1529.58 → 1529.84] Yeah.
[1529.84 → 1530.16] Okay.
[1530.52 → 1531.04] So does that.
[1531.28 → 1531.86] Because of the.
[1531.96 → 1532.94] I know it's because of the shadows.
[1533.06 → 1533.56] Because of the photo.
[1533.68 → 1535.04] But does that not look like a Beats logo?
[1535.66 → 1535.86] Yeah.
[1535.86 → 1536.72] It's the Chrome logo.
[1536.92 → 1538.30] But it super looks like a Beats logo.
[1538.40 → 1539.24] It's super-duper.
[1539.24 → 1539.32] It does.
[1539.32 → 1541.04] When I first saw it I was like what?
[1541.84 → 1542.28] Beats?
[1542.48 → 1542.82] Why?
[1543.20 → 1544.86] And then figured out that it's just because of the lighting.
[1545.04 → 1546.28] There's a better shot down low.
[1547.04 → 1548.12] Where you can actually see it.
[1548.74 → 1549.22] But it.
[1549.38 → 1549.54] Yeah.
[1549.70 → 1550.10] I was.
[1550.20 → 1551.44] I was pretty disappointed.
[1551.60 → 1554.04] And then realized that I was just seeing it improperly.
[1554.04 → 1558.82] So basically the idea is that you can plug whatever speaker into it.
[1558.82 → 1562.52] And it's just like a way better version than those like crap.
[1563.10 → 1568.44] Usually fantastic Bluetooth dongles that people have been using to do this for quite a while now.
[1568.88 → 1571.48] Because it should just work way better than that.
[1571.58 → 1571.70] Huh.
[1571.76 → 1572.10] That's funny.
[1572.20 → 1575.92] I can't really imagine what could be so bad about those dongles.
[1575.98 → 1578.76] I have an HTC one that I was playing around with.
[1578.76 → 1583.90] Because I'm actually planning to do a video with some car stuff that I'm doing with my car.
[1584.02 → 1585.72] And that was one of the things I was going to do.
[1586.60 → 1587.82] In your car it would be fine.
[1587.88 → 1588.48] It was fine.
[1588.84 → 1591.56] The nice thing about this is it's a Wi-Fi device.
[1591.94 → 1592.14] Right.
[1592.14 → 1592.88] Not a Bluetooth device.
[1593.02 → 1593.30] Also.
[1593.30 → 1595.96] So you can go on it and be like play this and then walk away.
[1596.06 → 1596.26] Right.
[1596.32 → 1596.84] Or disconnect.
[1597.12 → 1597.64] And it's fine.
[1597.84 → 1598.26] Ah.
[1598.30 → 1598.56] Okay.
[1598.66 → 1598.94] Okay.
[1598.94 → 1600.96] So that's a huge improvement over the Bluetooth dongles.
[1601.56 → 1602.78] It's a Wi-Fi device.
[1603.12 → 1603.26] Right.
[1603.26 → 1605.80] So you wouldn't really use it in your car either.
[1605.80 → 1605.96] Yeah.
[1606.00 → 1608.20] I can't think of any reason that I would need to do that.
[1608.20 → 1608.60] No.
[1609.60 → 1610.10] Cool beans.
[1610.42 → 1612.86] It's kind of nice because it's a Wi-Fi device.
[1613.00 → 1616.60] So you can like kind of swap between people fairly easily and whatnot.
[1616.88 → 1617.06] Right.
[1617.74 → 1619.70] Which would be kind of cool to do in the car.
[1619.88 → 1624.04] And you could theoretically do it in the car if you have some way of like creating a Wi-Fi network.
[1624.16 → 1626.20] Which should be pretty easy if you have a phone.
[1626.82 → 1629.58] But it's like not really the intended use case.
[1629.66 → 1629.80] Right.
[1629.80 → 1631.80] I think it's pretty cool.
[1632.58 → 1634.54] I could see a lot of people using this thing.
[1634.54 → 1638.38] It falls within the same realm as the Chromecast for me.
[1638.54 → 1641.78] Because it's like it's not a crazy thing.
[1641.88 → 1643.36] Cheap, cheerful, functional.
[1643.86 → 1644.06] Yeah.
[1644.22 → 1644.40] Right.
[1644.50 → 1646.18] Very cost-effective for what it does.
[1646.34 → 1648.14] And will probably work quite well.
[1648.14 → 1648.80] All right.
[1648.88 → 1651.64] So let's talk about things that worked quite well.
[1651.84 → 1654.42] This is a fantastic looking app.
[1654.52 → 1662.24] I am really looking forward to when this puppy comes out on the App Store and the Google Play Store.
[1662.24 → 1666.30] This is described as Yelp for people.
[1666.84 → 1675.68] And it will actually let you rate people in much the same way that you could rate a restaurant or a store or whatever else the case may be.
[1675.74 → 1676.62] So imagine this.
[1676.88 → 1678.38] You're buying something on Craigslist.
[1678.72 → 1681.52] Someone replies and their name is like I don't know.
[1681.54 → 1684.74] You're buying something on Craigslist and what you're buying happens to be a person, and they're rated.
[1684.86 → 1685.02] Wait.
[1685.12 → 1685.28] What?
[1685.42 → 1685.66] No.
[1685.98 → 1689.66] So the person you're buying from happens to be a one Josh Smith for example.
[1690.26 → 1690.72] Oh wow.
[1690.72 → 1701.10] And you look this guy up and you kind of go well gee he's got a review from he's got a two-star review from Linus for being tall and obnoxious.
[1701.18 → 1704.08] And a five-star review from Luke for being a sexy beast of a man.
[1704.18 → 1708.20] So you know he's got only a three and a half star average rating here.
[1708.28 → 1709.78] I don't think I want to sell to this guy.
[1710.12 → 1711.96] Can you imagine how useful that would be?
[1711.96 → 1724.36] Now imagine a world where everyone with you know who wasn't the popular kid in high school could have all the other students in their class post negative reviews about what a fantastic person they are.
[1724.36 → 1729.70] And then that person actually wouldn't have any way to remove their profile or those reviews.
[1730.58 → 1731.34] What a future.
[1732.62 → 1733.02] Yeah.
[1733.18 → 1735.78] Okay hopefully you guys have picked up the sarcasm at this point.
[1735.78 → 1735.86] Yeah.
[1736.28 → 1741.26] And co-founders Julia Corday and Nicole McCullough.
[1741.36 → 1742.08] I hope I said that right.
[1742.46 → 1745.54] Insist the app exists to promote positive feeling.
[1747.00 → 1749.98] I don't think they understand how the internet works.
[1749.98 → 1750.42] Yeah.
[1750.60 → 1755.38] As two empathetic female entrepreneurs in the tech space we want to spread love and positivity.
[1755.60 → 1757.10] I appreciate that message.
[1759.34 → 1761.16] But welcome to the internet.
[1763.00 → 1764.90] That's probably not going to be how things are going to work.
[1764.98 → 1769.20] They have some things kind of in place to try to help against this.
[1769.28 → 1771.98] But I think the administration of said things is going to be pretty insane.
[1772.10 → 1772.54] Impossible.
[1772.54 → 1780.56] Once you register negative reviews or sorry if you don't create a profile, but others are rating you only positive reviews will be posted.
[1781.14 → 1783.10] So that's an interesting thing to note.
[1783.98 → 1786.96] But I wonder if there are comments that go along with the stars.
[1787.02 → 1790.78] And a positive review could contain all kinds of hateful stuff in the comments.
[1790.78 → 1794.58] Because you could be like five-star bleep bleep bleep hate this person.
[1794.68 → 1796.06] Yeah and like this is like crazy stuff.
[1796.14 → 1799.62] So you have 48 hours after someone posts a negative review of you.
[1799.90 → 1800.54] If you register.
[1800.54 → 1802.50] You have 48 hours to dispute it if you register.
[1802.82 → 1803.38] Which is like.
[1803.80 → 1804.72] So what I have to be.
[1804.80 → 1812.60] So I have to be sitting around policing the reviews of me on the people app in order to.
[1812.72 → 1814.54] You know what really scares me about this kind of stuff too.
[1815.34 → 1817.76] Is we did it Reddit.
[1820.00 → 1820.94] Do you know what I mean by that.
[1821.14 → 1822.86] Like every time that Reddit is like.
[1823.08 → 1826.16] Oh wow we found the guy that did like the Boston bombing.
[1826.16 → 1828.44] And it turns out to totally be the wrong person.
[1828.86 → 1831.92] And they send like hateful emails and stuff to their family.
[1831.92 → 1833.66] And they get furious at all this kind of stuff.
[1834.08 → 1837.24] Like the internet just Zero rushing the wrong person.
[1837.84 → 1840.40] Could actually be a terrible thing with this app.
[1840.42 → 1842.82] I think we can all agree that the justice system.
[1843.06 → 1844.48] Regardless of which country you live in.
[1844.60 → 1846.46] Could probably use a little help.
[1846.72 → 1847.68] It ain't perfect.
[1847.86 → 1848.58] It can be bloated.
[1848.70 → 1849.48] It can be slow.
[1850.26 → 1851.66] Civilians helping is a good thing.
[1851.76 → 1853.18] Civilians helping is a good thing.
[1853.18 → 1858.28] But there is also a reason a lot of the time for the due diligence.
[1859.22 → 1865.56] And the sort of methodical nature that sometimes gets mistaken as being slow and bloated.
[1866.08 → 1868.18] That the real system goes through.
[1868.34 → 1869.82] Because the kind of.
[1869.92 → 1873.52] I mean honestly it is enough for someone to be.
[1873.52 → 1874.44] To be.
[1874.98 → 1879.02] I had a teacher once that was pushed out of his job at a particular school.
[1879.40 → 1881.14] Simply because of an accusation.
[1881.82 → 1884.04] Not because anything was ever proven.
[1884.38 → 1886.30] Or any charges were ever even laid.
[1886.78 → 1891.64] An accusation is all it takes to colour people's view of another person.
[1891.72 → 1892.46] It's just how we are.
[1892.58 → 1894.66] If you're accused of something or whatever.
[1894.82 → 1896.22] And you totally didn't do it.
[1896.28 → 1898.56] The first Google result is still going to be the accusation.
[1898.56 → 1900.30] It'll always be that article.
[1900.48 → 1901.02] Blah blah blah.
[1901.16 → 1902.56] Charges laid for you know whatever.
[1902.56 → 1906.00] Which is why a lot of the times they keep the names anonymous until they're fully.
[1906.14 → 1906.34] Yeah.
[1906.44 → 1907.22] A lot of the times.
[1907.44 → 1908.16] Not always.
[1908.26 → 1908.74] Not always.
[1910.04 → 1911.72] So I don't know what else there is.
[1911.80 → 1913.34] I don't really know what else there is.
[1913.34 → 1914.72] We'll see what happens once it comes out.
[1914.86 → 1919.36] Maybe there will be some weird impossible beam of hope that keeps it a positive app.
[1919.52 → 1920.60] But knowing the internet.
[1921.96 → 1923.10] I seriously doubt it.
[1924.20 → 1926.50] It's going to become for lack of a better term.
[1926.60 → 1928.04] A circle jerk for certain people.
[1928.04 → 1931.72] Like you said the popular kid at school is going to have the greatest rating everywhere.
[1931.90 → 1934.88] Because everyone wants to rate him publicly or her publicly.
[1935.38 → 1937.72] So that that person thinks that they like them.
[1937.82 → 1940.30] So that hopefully they'll be in good spots.
[1940.74 → 1943.66] And then if that person doesn't like someone.
[1943.80 → 1945.04] Then it's going to be negative flow.
[1945.14 → 1948.28] And like it's just going to be a crazy popularity contest I think.
[1948.46 → 1949.56] Do you want to hear something crazy?
[1949.94 → 1954.60] It actually took me about 15 to 20 seconds to realize what a horrible idea this was.
[1954.60 → 1959.06] Because I am so accustomed to not having any privacy anyway.
[1959.38 → 1959.62] Yeah.
[1959.76 → 1968.86] That I don't actually necessarily think about that aspect of a social network or an app or whatever the case may be right away.
[1968.86 → 1975.48] So I am used to people being able to leave a review of me anywhere they want.
[1975.48 → 1975.50] Yeah.
[1975.50 → 1976.62] And like I don't care.
[1976.70 → 1977.70] Because we're used to that.
[1977.82 → 1979.86] But like some people will not.
[1980.86 → 1982.10] And that's their right.
[1982.26 → 1982.50] Yes.
[1982.50 → 1982.86] That's their right.
[1982.98 → 1988.20] I as an adult knowingly and willingly gave up my a lot of my privacy.
[1988.56 → 1990.88] I kind of didn't knowingly and willingly.
[1991.16 → 1991.30] Yeah.
[1991.30 → 1991.54] It just sort of happened.
[1991.54 → 1993.26] You were like hey bro film a video.
[1993.52 → 1994.12] And I was like alright.
[1994.78 → 1995.70] But it's fine.
[1995.78 → 1996.92] Welcome to the plan show.
[1998.74 → 2001.66] But like I knew that going into this.
[2002.06 → 2002.82] And it was fine.
[2002.86 → 2004.00] And here you are now.
[2004.52 → 2007.26] With like the fact that you have a pool being big news.
[2011.02 → 2011.42] Yes.
[2011.90 → 2012.94] My parents pool.
[2012.94 → 2014.16] We don't have the pool anymore.
[2014.78 → 2016.44] It got torn down this summer.
[2016.50 → 2017.10] Oh I actually did.
[2017.16 → 2017.34] Okay.
[2017.34 → 2018.08] I did not know that.
[2018.28 → 2022.30] So do I think that there is potential.
[2022.52 → 2025.36] I mean we've talked a lot about anonymity.
[2025.88 → 2028.06] And people's rights surrounding it.
[2028.26 → 2033.48] And the benefits to other people of less anonymity in a lot of cases.
[2034.94 → 2041.52] Can I think of situations where this would be useful for me.
[2041.52 → 2045.66] To know that that person doesn't return tools when you lend them to them.
[2045.66 → 2047.40] Or whatever else.
[2047.84 → 2051.96] Like I can think of a thousand ways this would be useful.
[2051.96 → 2060.92] But I can't think of a single way that it would be useful to someone for their own account.
[2060.92 → 2065.26] Like I can't think of anything someone could say about me on my own account.
[2065.56 → 2067.76] Like in a review that would benefit me.
[2068.32 → 2072.18] So people could say like oh yeah he's kind of like he kind of talks over people.
[2072.34 → 2075.04] Like when that Luke guy was trying to talk like 20 seconds ago.
[2075.04 → 2077.82] He just kept ongoing like a freight train.
[2078.08 → 2079.62] I freaking hate that guy.
[2079.66 → 2080.50] I don't even register it anymore.
[2081.76 → 2082.94] Sorry I saw it.
[2083.00 → 2086.48] But I was just going to finish this point and then hand it to you.
[2087.06 → 2090.48] Like I can see that being useful information for other people to have.
[2090.56 → 2091.34] But I don't want them to.
[2091.34 → 2094.02] I don't want that to be the first thing they know about me.
[2094.12 → 2095.14] That's a huge part of it.
[2095.22 → 2098.90] It's like I have an opportunity to make a good first impression.
[2099.48 → 2099.74] Right?
[2100.66 → 2106.74] So why should they get you know all the skeletons in the closet right off the bat?
[2107.24 → 2109.26] I mean shouldn't I get a chance to get to know these people?
[2109.30 → 2110.96] Maybe I have other redeeming qualities you know?
[2111.64 → 2113.44] And we're relying on user reviews.
[2113.62 → 2116.94] Which quite frankly you look at how broken user reviews are.
[2116.94 → 2120.70] Or you know for things as simple as a freaking USB cable on Amazon.
[2121.48 → 2123.18] And something as complex as a human.
[2123.28 → 2124.84] You're going to trust other people to review them.
[2125.26 → 2127.74] One thing that I worry about too is like timed sniping.
[2127.98 → 2129.30] This is what I was trying to say earlier.
[2129.46 → 2132.08] Is like oh they're going on a hiking trip.
[2132.18 → 2132.82] Or a business trip.
[2132.94 → 2133.36] Or something.
[2133.68 → 2135.32] They're swapping out their SIM.
[2135.42 → 2136.34] It's based on your phone number.
[2136.58 → 2140.36] They're doing something that they wouldn't be able to take advantage of the 48-hour window.
[2140.66 → 2143.02] Let's leave some inflammatory stuff.
[2143.78 → 2144.14] Right.
[2144.74 → 2144.96] Right?
[2144.96 → 2145.32] Yep.
[2145.72 → 2148.06] I can see people getting trolled like that.
[2148.28 → 2148.52] Yeah.
[2148.66 → 2149.58] Well that's not working.
[2149.80 → 2152.38] Someone wanted me to move it to the top right, and it didn't happen.
[2152.46 → 2153.36] We will at some point.
[2154.04 → 2154.28] Yep.
[2155.54 → 2155.98] Okay.
[2156.10 → 2158.00] Oh we should do our sponsors.
[2158.36 → 2158.60] Yes.
[2158.78 → 2159.44] Before I forget.
[2160.40 → 2161.42] Not that I would ever forget.
[2161.96 → 2165.04] Not that I would ever forget my time with Linda.
[2166.80 → 2167.24] Wow.
[2169.18 → 2172.90] Well probably not because you could download the lessons.
[2172.90 → 2174.26] And watch them offline.
[2174.44 → 2175.72] So there would be no reason for you to forget.
[2175.72 → 2176.28] That's right.
[2176.44 → 2177.92] And I would be reminded.
[2178.32 → 2178.60] Yeah.
[2178.76 → 2181.68] Every day I went to my new like cool job.
[2181.88 → 2183.34] With my new cool skills.
[2183.46 → 2183.64] Yep.
[2184.00 → 2186.74] Of the fact that I learned them on lynda.com.
[2186.84 → 2187.10] Yes.
[2187.16 → 2187.40] Okay.
[2187.50 → 2188.76] So why don't we seriously do this.
[2188.84 → 2189.78] So lynda.com.
[2189.84 → 2190.94] The place to learn online.
[2191.02 → 2192.24] Whether we're talking digital photography.
[2192.40 → 2192.86] Video editing.
[2193.02 → 2193.32] Business.
[2193.82 → 2194.60] Word processing.
[2195.42 → 2196.80] I'm sure they have other things.
[2197.86 → 2198.26] Excel.
[2198.54 → 2198.86] Photoshop.
[2199.04 → 2199.46] Thank you.
[2199.56 → 2199.82] PowerPoint.
[2200.22 → 2200.62] Basically.
[2201.28 → 2203.26] Great courses taught by industry experts.
[2203.72 → 2205.50] And you can view them on your computer.
[2205.58 → 2206.16] Your mobile device.
[2206.28 → 2208.18] You can watch in any order you want.
[2208.24 → 2209.40] You can put together playlists.
[2209.46 → 2210.52] You can share them with your friends.
[2210.60 → 2213.66] You guys can all go through and create like your own mini curriculum.
[2214.22 → 2215.60] And the best part.
[2216.60 → 2217.00] Oh.
[2218.04 → 2218.38] I'm sorry.
[2218.58 → 2218.76] Oh.
[2219.18 → 2219.48] Uh.
[2219.86 → 2220.12] There.
[2220.24 → 2220.56] Ah.
[2221.08 → 2222.50] lynda.com slash WAN show.
[2222.88 → 2223.10] For a.
[2223.22 → 2223.64] Sorry.
[2223.80 → 2226.50] For a 10-day free trial today.
[2226.68 → 2228.90] Plan started at only $25 a month.
[2229.08 → 2232.34] And we are huge lynda.com supporters here on the WAN show.
[2232.42 → 2233.76] Not just because they're sponsors.
[2233.90 → 2238.28] But because we have people who have been using Lynda since before the WAN show.
[2238.48 → 2239.80] Since before Linus Media Group.
[2240.12 → 2241.86] Since before they were even born.
[2242.94 → 2243.34] No.
[2243.46 → 2244.82] The last one was an outright lie.
[2244.88 → 2245.50] But the rest was.
[2245.54 → 2246.20] The rest was good.
[2246.26 → 2246.96] The rest was all cool.
[2247.12 → 2247.28] Yes.
[2247.66 → 2249.10] Speaking of things that are all cool.
[2249.10 → 2250.80] Squarespace.com.
[2251.12 → 2251.48] The place.
[2251.48 → 2252.12] Build it beautiful.
[2252.22 → 2252.38] Yeah.
[2252.48 → 2253.04] Thank you.
[2253.04 → 2253.84] The place to build it beautiful.
[2253.86 → 2254.94] The place to build it beautiful.
[2255.02 → 2257.54] Someone was listening to a podcast the other day.
[2257.58 → 2258.66] And there was a Squarespace ad.
[2258.72 → 2259.68] And they said build it beautiful.
[2259.68 → 2265.08] And they said they immediately had like a whole brain takeover thought of me repeatedly saying that.
[2265.24 → 2267.70] So I think my job is done.
[2269.36 → 2269.84] No.
[2270.06 → 2275.76] Your job in a sponsor spot is to make people think of the sponsor.
[2276.08 → 2276.36] Squarespace.
[2276.48 → 2276.82] When they.
[2277.02 → 2277.44] Build it beautiful.
[2277.44 → 2278.66] I know who the sponsor is.
[2278.66 → 2280.32] Think of the sponsor.
[2280.54 → 2280.78] Squarespace.
[2280.96 → 2281.24] When they.
[2281.54 → 2281.88] Build it beautiful.
[2281.88 → 2283.18] When they want to build a website.
[2283.28 → 2283.64] Beautifully.
[2283.72 → 2285.28] They're not supposed to think of you.
[2285.56 → 2287.18] When they hear Squarespace's slogan.
[2288.18 → 2289.64] That's not the point at all.
[2290.20 → 2292.26] Well maybe when they look at me, they think of Squarespace.
[2292.92 → 2294.00] Maybe it works both ways.
[2294.10 → 2295.38] Maybe it's because you're such a square.
[2295.50 → 2295.82] Bam.
[2296.04 → 2296.36] Space.
[2296.68 → 2297.14] Build it beautiful.
[2298.26 → 2298.62] Alright.
[2298.86 → 2299.16] So.
[2299.62 → 2304.94] Squarespace has loads of beautiful easy to use templates that you can build upon.
[2304.94 → 2306.46] To make your website.
[2307.10 → 2308.58] They look great on mobile.
[2309.46 → 2309.82] Laptops.
[2310.02 → 2310.34] Desktops.
[2310.44 → 2311.58] Whatever the case may be.
[2311.68 → 2312.90] You can use them for all kinds of stuff.
[2312.96 → 2313.58] Whether it's a blog.
[2313.66 → 2314.22] A portfolio.
[2314.54 → 2315.42] An online store.
[2315.52 → 2317.38] To sell knick-knacks like Luke's mom does.
[2317.56 → 2317.78] Yep.
[2317.78 → 2322.04] And they start at just $8 a month with a free domain thrown in for you.
[2322.16 → 2323.90] If you sign up for an entire year.
[2323.98 → 2325.38] So you can start your free trial today.
[2325.88 → 2328.38] At squarespace.com.
[2328.54 → 2331.26] And use offer code Linus to save 10%.
[2331.26 → 2332.06] Luke.
[2333.44 → 2334.00] Squarespace.
[2334.80 → 2335.64] Build it beautiful.
[2336.06 → 2336.62] Thank you.
[2337.16 → 2337.44] Alright.
[2337.60 → 2338.30] And finally.
[2339.58 → 2340.14] Finally.
[2340.36 → 2341.08] Tunnel Bear.
[2341.30 → 2341.82] Tunnel Bear.
[2341.82 → 2346.62] The easy-to-use privacy VPN app for mobile and desktop.
[2346.78 → 2349.58] They got support for iOS, Android, Mac, PC, and Chrome.
[2349.70 → 2354.32] And you can tunnel through more than up to.
[2354.36 → 2354.46] No.
[2354.54 → 2354.82] Exactly.
[2355.24 → 2356.58] 14 different countries.
[2356.58 → 2357.96] Allowing you to browse the internet.
[2358.34 → 2361.18] And use online services as though you were in that country.
[2361.32 → 2366.30] So this is great for circumventing sites that you wouldn't normally have access to.
[2366.30 → 2372.52] People love using this stuff for watching online video or streaming music for example.
[2373.06 → 2379.70] When they don't have because the powers that be would not grant them the privilege to buy
[2379.70 → 2381.06] the content legitimately.
[2382.18 → 2385.32] So VPNs for people who are really determined not to pirate.
[2385.72 → 2387.18] Like you guys are awesome by the way.
[2387.24 → 2389.98] When you pay more money just to not pirate.
[2390.10 → 2392.12] Just to pay money to the content makers.
[2392.40 → 2395.46] We actually have another use for this in a video that's coming up soon.
[2395.46 → 2397.18] So stay tuned for that.
[2398.58 → 2398.86] Yeah.
[2400.16 → 2400.60] Anyway.
[2401.02 → 2403.60] So they have a plain English privacy policy.
[2403.82 → 2404.92] Your connection is encrypted.
[2405.10 → 2407.24] And you don't have to be technical to use Tunnel Bear.
[2407.32 → 2409.54] They have friendly support bears.
[2410.10 → 2412.22] And they can help you out with.
[2413.46 → 2414.82] That video is going to be great though.
[2414.94 → 2416.02] And they can help you out.
[2416.12 → 2418.98] So they give you 500 megabytes of data for free.
[2419.18 → 2420.12] So you can try it out.
[2420.48 → 2420.88] Absolutely.
[2421.44 → 2422.82] No questions asked.
[2422.90 → 2423.76] Just try it out.
[2423.76 → 2426.14] And they'll give you an extra gig if you tweet at them.
[2426.20 → 2426.96] If you need more data.
[2427.36 → 2429.20] Unlimited plans start at $6.99 a month.
[2429.30 → 2432.62] So check it out at tunnelbear.com slash LTT.
[2435.42 → 2436.18] All right.
[2436.40 → 2437.38] We've actually got.
[2437.50 → 2439.96] We could probably run the show for another two hours.
[2440.08 → 2441.98] There are a lot of topics.
[2442.02 → 2445.58] I think we might have to just rapid fire as many of these as we can.
[2445.58 → 2450.90] So why don't we start with the Zone article.
[2450.90 → 2452.26] Did you drop it in the Twitch chat already?
[2452.38 → 2452.74] No.
[2452.96 → 2453.54] Do you want to do that?
[2453.92 → 2454.28] Sure.
[2454.40 → 2454.52] Yeah.
[2454.54 → 2454.84] I'll do it.
[2454.86 → 2455.04] Go ahead.
[2455.44 → 2460.16] So it's suspected that a mobile advertising network has been used to DDoS a site with hundreds
[2460.16 → 2462.74] of thousands of smartphone browsers.
[2462.74 → 2465.22] Which is actually like kind of insane.
[2465.40 → 2471.14] Cloudflare stated that one customer is hit by 4.5 billion-page requests over a few hours.
[2471.52 → 2474.94] Most of the smartphone browsers are on Chinese IPs.
[2474.94 → 2476.54] It's apparently a browser-based.
[2476.56 → 2477.00] Way to go, China.
[2477.56 → 2478.04] Wow.
[2479.04 → 2479.84] Not the point.
[2482.64 → 2487.98] Apparently it's a browser-based layer 7 or application layer flood attack.
[2488.18 → 2493.28] They've been viewed as theoretical in this way for several years, but haven't become a
[2493.28 → 2498.04] reality until now due to difficulties in efficiently distributing malicious JavaScript code.
[2498.16 → 2500.50] But that's where the advertising network comes in.
[2500.50 → 2509.46] The browser attack peaked at over 275,000 HTTP requests per second.
[2510.60 → 2512.58] 80% from mobile devices.
[2512.80 → 2515.06] 98% from Chinese IPs.
[2516.12 → 2517.72] Way to go, China.
[2517.98 → 2518.82] Not the point.
[2519.00 → 2519.24] Again.
[2520.24 → 2521.54] Not the point at all.
[2522.12 → 2522.50] It's probably just...
[2522.50 → 2526.50] It was probably just a hijacked advertising network that was within China.
[2526.50 → 2526.58] I know.
[2527.22 → 2527.50] It's not...
[2528.76 → 2529.72] Way to go, China.
[2529.82 → 2530.32] Wow!
[2531.72 → 2532.20] Okay.
[2532.44 → 2533.32] That's probably about it.
[2533.38 → 2534.24] That's intense.
[2534.56 → 2539.88] T-Mobile customers exposed in major Experian data breach.
[2541.06 → 2541.64] All right.
[2541.74 → 2542.42] So here we go.
[2542.52 → 2545.22] Loading up the original article here on theverge.com.
[2545.56 → 2546.60] Did you post the link already?
[2546.62 → 2546.86] On it.
[2546.86 → 2547.86] We got this.
[2547.98 → 2548.30] Okay.
[2549.72 → 2551.42] So, yeah.
[2551.64 → 2557.98] I mean, I'm not going to say that the fact that, like, everyone gets breached makes us
[2557.98 → 2561.40] feel any better about the breach that we had on the forum, but...
[2561.40 → 2562.12] It kind of does.
[2562.20 → 2566.08] There's actually been some pretty ridiculous stuff in the last little bit.
[2566.12 → 2571.84] All I'm saying is this is why we didn't store financial data.
[2571.84 → 2572.28] Yep.
[2572.68 → 2573.16] This is...
[2573.16 → 2576.80] I mean, a lot of people have asked us why the only payment method we accept through
[2576.80 → 2577.70] the forum is PayPal.
[2578.32 → 2581.32] And it's because it's PayPal's problem.
[2581.56 → 2581.86] Yeah.
[2581.96 → 2583.64] We do not want your credit card.
[2583.66 → 2585.40] I don't want to touch that at all, ever.
[2585.66 → 2588.98] I never want to see your credit card and your credit card.
[2589.28 → 2590.90] You don't want to show me your credit card.
[2591.08 → 2592.18] You don't want to do it.
[2592.48 → 2596.20] Because that is not the kind of stuff that we want to be responsible for.
[2596.28 → 2601.00] I mean, honestly, it's enough for us that we have, you know, name data and stuff like
[2601.00 → 2601.24] that.
[2601.26 → 2604.20] And that wasn't even what was compromised for us anyway.
[2604.68 → 2608.16] Even if we had stored credit cards, that wouldn't have been compromised.
[2608.96 → 2612.40] But we still don't want it, ever.
[2612.76 → 2612.84] Yeah.
[2613.46 → 2617.72] So 15 million Americans were affected.
[2618.24 → 2622.08] And the breach revealed names, addresses, and social security numbers.
[2623.08 → 2629.12] I mean, to put that in context, that's about 3.5% to 4% of the United States population.
[2629.12 → 2632.08] And definitely enough information to steal your identity.
[2632.30 → 2632.56] Yes.
[2633.04 → 2637.50] It's unclear how many other companies were involved in the breach, but no banking or credit
[2637.50 → 2639.92] card information seems to have been leaked.
[2639.92 → 2644.86] But your name, address, and social security number, so they could probably get your banking
[2644.86 → 2645.32] information.
[2645.40 → 2649.24] Now, with that said, the social security numbers were being stored in encrypted files, but
[2649.24 → 2652.00] it is not clear if that encryption has been compromised.
[2652.18 → 2652.42] Okay.
[2652.70 → 2652.94] Okay.
[2653.36 → 2654.58] So, um...
[2654.58 → 2655.80] Do we know how they were encrypted?
[2656.66 → 2659.86] Uh, no, I don't actually 100% know.
[2659.86 → 2659.88] Okay.
[2659.88 → 2663.94] I don't think that's in the article or anything, but how they were encrypted would actually give
[2663.94 → 2665.20] some insight whether...
[2665.20 → 2670.02] Because if it's like some fantastic form of encryption, they probably have them.
[2670.42 → 2672.50] But if it's a little bit more advanced, then I don't know.
[2673.18 → 2674.26] I don't think it's in here.
[2674.92 → 2675.40] It's not.
[2675.94 → 2676.52] But...
[2676.52 → 2677.38] All right.
[2677.54 → 2677.84] Oh, well.
[2678.08 → 2683.38] By the year 2050, this actually ties in pretty well to something we were talking about last
[2683.38 → 2683.76] week.
[2684.80 → 2691.48] Human-on-robot sex could be more common than human-on-human sex.
[2692.42 → 2694.12] Again, I find this not very surprising.
[2696.26 → 2699.78] At the very least, just because of, like, masturbation statistics.
[2700.06 → 2700.30] Mm-hmm.
[2700.70 → 2703.14] People probably get off by themselves more than they get off with a partner.
[2703.72 → 2704.24] Speak for yourself.
[2704.92 → 2705.70] Throughout their lifespan.
[2705.70 → 2706.02] Ah.
[2706.48 → 2707.34] Speak for yourself.
[2711.18 → 2711.96] I don't know.
[2712.74 → 2713.46] Actually, I wonder.
[2715.14 → 2715.54] Right?
[2716.10 → 2719.10] Like, still in a relationship, you probably...
[2719.10 → 2719.76] Like, sometimes?
[2720.10 → 2720.36] I don't know.
[2720.50 → 2721.60] Yeah, speak for yourself, man.
[2721.80 → 2722.50] Libido differences?
[2723.30 → 2724.60] Mine's pretty...
[2724.60 → 2727.76] I don't know.
[2728.30 → 2728.80] All right.
[2728.86 → 2731.74] So, this is the TMI edition of The Women's Show.
[2731.74 → 2735.18] I mean, I didn't...
[2735.18 → 2738.36] Yeah, I don't know.
[2738.46 → 2743.54] So, what they're saying is by 2030, most people will have some form of virtual sex, they're
[2743.54 → 2746.12] saying, as casually as they browse porn today.
[2746.96 → 2747.62] That's kind of interesting.
[2747.80 → 2749.72] That's 15 years from now.
[2749.72 → 2756.22] And the Consumer Version 1 is coming out pretty soon.
[2756.36 → 2757.84] Did you say 15 years from now?
[2757.94 → 2758.52] No, no, 35.
[2759.88 → 2760.14] What?
[2760.74 → 2761.10] 2030?
[2761.32 → 2761.86] Oh, 2030.
[2762.04 → 2762.58] Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[2762.58 → 2762.64] Yeah.
[2762.64 → 2764.16] No, this isn't for robots.
[2764.26 → 2766.08] They're just saying virtual sex, so like VR stuff.
[2766.10 → 2767.10] So, VR...
[2767.10 → 2770.12] I mean, what would you consider to be VR sex?
[2770.20 → 2774.60] Because you wouldn't even necessarily need, like, a USB accessory.
[2774.90 → 2775.12] Nope.
[2775.24 → 2776.22] And a VR headset.
[2776.38 → 2780.12] It could just be a matter of touching yourself with a headset on, and that could be like a
[2780.12 → 2782.24] virtual sexual experience.
[2782.48 → 2784.84] I think that's what they're saying there.
[2784.86 → 2785.40] Yeah, okay.
[2785.58 → 2790.28] Because in five years after that, they say 2035, the majority of people will own sex toys
[2790.28 → 2792.10] that interact with VR in some form.
[2792.10 → 2794.74] I mean, they're also being very loose and easy with their wording here.
[2794.84 → 2795.62] They super are.
[2795.82 → 2796.50] Oh, wow.
[2796.58 → 2798.62] Saying things like, most people.
[2798.92 → 2799.50] Excuse me.
[2799.62 → 2800.48] Most people.
[2800.72 → 2800.92] Yeah.
[2801.10 → 2805.96] Most people in 15 years probably still won't even have, like, decent internet connections.
[2806.04 → 2807.22] I was just going to say that.
[2807.26 → 2808.56] What do you mean, most people?
[2809.28 → 2813.80] Like, most people in first world countries who also kind of at least somewhat like technology.
[2813.88 → 2814.42] Outdated term.
[2814.68 → 2814.90] Sorry.
[2815.22 → 2816.18] Developed nations.
[2816.56 → 2818.32] That's, like, honestly, I think that one's worse.
[2818.32 → 2822.76] No, the first world and third world is actually, like, a Cold War.
[2822.88 → 2823.90] It's a Cold War term.
[2824.04 → 2824.36] Oh, wow.
[2824.64 → 2824.88] Yeah.
[2825.02 → 2825.34] Right.
[2825.42 → 2827.54] It has, like, some weird meanings.
[2827.66 → 2827.88] Yes.
[2828.72 → 2829.46] Oh, yeah.
[2829.58 → 2831.02] It's like what group you're a part of.
[2831.02 → 2835.88] And then, honestly, though, I think the connotation of developed versus developing countries is
[2835.88 → 2836.86] way worse.
[2836.90 → 2837.34] That's pretty rough.
[2837.34 → 2839.56] That's, like, saying, like, I'm a like.
[2839.56 → 2842.86] And not even necessarily true because in a, quote, unquote, developed country, there's
[2842.86 → 2845.34] probably more science and development going on.
[2846.22 → 2848.58] Well, that's exactly it.
[2848.84 → 2851.88] Being, you're never developed, I think, is the point that you're trying to make.
[2851.88 → 2852.42] That's what I'm saying.
[2852.48 → 2852.64] Yeah.
[2853.00 → 2853.52] And, like.
[2853.52 → 2855.16] Even if you look at infrastructure, we're still improving.
[2855.28 → 2857.16] And calling someone else, like, developing.
[2857.38 → 2859.12] Like, that's, honestly, that's the kind of thing.
[2859.12 → 2859.28] That's just insulting.
[2859.44 → 2861.88] I could see that turning into, like, a playground insult.
[2862.30 → 2862.46] Yeah.
[2862.46 → 2864.00] It's like, yeah, that's the developing kid.
[2864.46 → 2864.98] You know what I mean?
[2865.04 → 2866.00] Like, that's exactly.
[2866.00 → 2867.28] When you're at the UN or whatever?
[2867.42 → 2867.60] Yeah.
[2868.12 → 2868.48] Right.
[2868.62 → 2868.92] Right?
[2869.12 → 2869.34] Yeah.
[2869.52 → 2871.58] Can you just imagine, like, all the ambassadors?
[2871.98 → 2872.32] Yeah.
[2873.80 → 2874.16] Developing.
[2874.26 → 2874.58] Developing.
[2874.58 → 2875.58] Don't worry about him.
[2875.62 → 2876.36] He's just developing.
[2876.38 → 2877.08] He's just developing.
[2877.18 → 2877.76] Like, that's brutal.
[2877.92 → 2878.34] That's rough.
[2878.64 → 2879.42] So, anyway.
[2879.92 → 2880.14] Okay.
[2880.82 → 2883.18] So, less affluent countries.
[2883.26 → 2883.96] Why don't we say that?
[2884.06 → 2884.32] Sure.
[2885.60 → 2892.18] And then they're saying, again, with the loose terminology, robot sex to overtake human to
[2892.18 → 2893.20] human in 2050.
[2893.44 → 2895.42] But, like, maybe.
[2896.00 → 2896.72] Yeah, maybe.
[2896.86 → 2900.00] I mean, that is some crystal balls stuff right there.
[2900.14 → 2902.16] A lot of this is kind of crystal balls stuff.
[2902.78 → 2904.56] I wonder if anyone has two.
[2904.80 → 2905.14] Anyway.
[2906.86 → 2911.58] Apparently, the sex toy market has been growing by 6% every year, but it doesn't specify for
[2911.58 → 2912.18] how many years.
[2912.32 → 2914.56] Again, a lot of this is a little up in the air.
[2914.56 → 2914.88] Yeah.
[2915.88 → 2916.08] Yeah.
[2916.18 → 2918.28] I don't really find this all that surprising.
[2918.98 → 2919.46] Yeah.
[2919.46 → 2924.24] Like, even just porn is becoming much easier for people in public to talk about.
[2924.62 → 2928.26] There's been protests in, what, the UK against porn being banned.
[2928.26 → 2931.28] And, like, people went out without masks to protest it.
[2931.60 → 2933.92] Like, it's becoming much less taboo these days.
[2934.26 → 2937.10] So, as that becomes much less taboo, with Pornhub...
[2937.10 → 2938.88] You should have gone out without pants to protest it.
[2939.32 → 2939.50] Didn't?
[2939.58 → 2940.48] I think some people, like...
[2940.48 → 2941.08] I probably did.
[2941.18 → 2941.32] Yeah.
[2941.32 → 2945.60] With Pornhub releasing, like, the twerking butt thing.
[2945.76 → 2946.28] Did you see that?
[2946.30 → 2946.76] That was hilarious.
[2946.96 → 2949.22] Like, it's becoming a...
[2949.22 → 2951.52] Like, you can laugh about it.
[2951.64 → 2952.68] It's becoming more mainstream.
[2952.84 → 2953.66] People are making jokes about it.
[2953.68 → 2954.70] People are talking about it publicly.
[2955.56 → 2957.24] Game of Thrones is pretty much...
[2957.24 → 2959.04] Game of Thrones is, like...
[2959.04 → 2960.92] Wow.
[2961.08 → 2962.68] Like, there's some pretty racy porn on there.
[2962.80 → 2964.36] There's some pretty mainstream...
[2964.36 → 2965.48] Ancestral relationships.
[2965.76 → 2968.74] Like, it gets pretty intense on there.
[2969.22 → 2970.22] So, like...
[2970.22 → 2970.82] I don't know.
[2970.82 → 2972.60] It's becoming very not weird.
[2972.78 → 2976.32] So, if you give it that trend and that continuation...
[2976.32 → 2976.38] Yeah.
[2976.38 → 2977.26] And then until, what?
[2977.64 → 2978.92] 2050, they're talking about?
[2979.12 → 2979.76] Like, okay.
[2980.72 → 2981.78] Wouldn't be that surprised.
[2982.34 → 2982.76] Yeah.
[2982.82 → 2985.04] I mean, I still have some...
[2985.04 → 2987.52] I still have sort of some concerns about that.
[2988.02 → 2990.62] I mean, I think Fukuyama covered it pretty well.
[2990.72 → 2993.18] I think it could lead to fewer relationships.
[2993.32 → 2995.00] But at the same time, we have an overpopulation issue.
[2995.12 → 2996.78] So, like, is that really that big of a problem?
[2996.82 → 2997.08] Yeah.
[2997.16 → 2997.36] Yeah.
[2997.36 → 2999.82] So, basically, we'll just weed ourselves out until...
[2999.82 → 3002.02] We are not as many anymore.
[3002.16 → 3003.50] And I guess that'll be a thing.
[3003.62 → 3004.42] That might be a thing.
[3005.64 → 3008.70] Tesla unveils the Model X.
[3009.04 → 3009.32] Yeah.
[3009.96 → 3011.38] Speaking of sex...
[3011.38 → 3011.64] Oh!
[3011.64 → 3013.82] We've got the Model S, the Model 3, and the Model X.
[3013.82 → 3015.02] That's a joke on a couple different levels.
[3015.02 → 3016.26] Oh, yeah.
[3016.34 → 3016.94] And it's sexy.
[3017.06 → 3017.22] Right.
[3017.36 → 3017.70] Good job.
[3018.06 → 3019.26] Did you post this yet?
[3019.26 → 3019.82] I'm working on it.
[3019.82 → 3020.12] Okay.
[3020.24 → 3024.30] So, that is what it looks like, which surprises absolutely no one at all.
[3024.44 → 3024.82] Yep.
[3024.96 → 3028.04] Since this has been teased many, many times.
[3028.06 → 3028.86] We've literally seen one.
[3028.86 → 3030.66] We've literally seen one in person.
[3030.96 → 3031.16] Yeah.
[3031.28 → 3032.42] There's been minor changes since then.
[3032.42 → 3032.96] There have been tweaks.
[3033.14 → 3033.34] Yep.
[3034.76 → 3035.86] Or twerks, as it were.
[3036.20 → 3036.72] Ah-ha-ha.
[3036.80 → 3037.40] Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.
[3037.40 → 3038.28] So, you look at its butt.
[3038.48 → 3038.72] Ah.
[3038.72 → 3039.72] Ah-ha-ha-ha.
[3039.72 → 3040.32] Ah-ha-ha-ha.
[3042.50 → 3043.68] Ah, do you want to give us the rundown?
[3044.14 → 3044.42] Okay.
[3044.60 → 3046.64] So, there are a bunch of different things that people are talking about.
[3046.74 → 3049.14] There's stuff that we've already known for a long time, but I'm going to go through some
[3049.14 → 3050.90] of the quotes and specs here first.
[3051.14 → 3055.20] They say it's the safest, fastest, and most capable sports utility vehicle in history.
[3055.68 → 3059.72] That's actually not astounding, considering what they did for the Model S.
[3060.20 → 3065.44] Shares DNA with the top-of-the-line Model SP90D, which is pretty epic.
[3065.44 → 3071.58] Ah, standard with all-wheel drive and a 90-kilowatt-hour battery, providing 250 miles of range.
[3072.92 → 3073.18] Sorry.
[3073.50 → 3077.50] Ah, performance and standard models available, P90D and 90D.
[3077.62 → 3079.80] It has seven seats, which is...
[3079.80 → 3080.38] Is that a lot?
[3080.52 → 3081.22] That's a lot, right?
[3082.36 → 3083.60] I only look at sedans.
[3083.74 → 3084.14] I don't know.
[3084.90 → 3087.26] At least a five being a lot.
[3088.70 → 3089.80] It's not even a lot.
[3089.86 → 3091.02] That's just standard.
[3091.96 → 3093.06] The seven standard?
[3093.66 → 3094.14] No.
[3094.14 → 3095.94] Well, in an SUV, yes.
[3096.08 → 3096.68] There we go.
[3096.86 → 3097.12] All right.
[3097.36 → 3098.44] So it's not necessarily a lot.
[3098.44 → 3098.70] I hate you.
[3099.50 → 3103.92] 060 in as little as 3.2 seconds in your family car, which is fantastic.
[3103.94 → 3104.78] That's hilarious.
[3105.38 → 3111.90] Same as a Königsberg CCX 4.7 V8, although your top speed is not going to be the same.
[3112.00 → 3113.92] Yeah, it's limited to 155 miles an hour.
[3113.92 → 3115.28] It's about 200 kilometres an hour.
[3115.38 → 3119.30] Frankly, you shouldn't be driving your kids around at 200 kilometres an hour anyway.
[3119.42 → 3119.80] Yes.
[3119.98 → 3120.24] Yeah.
[3120.24 → 3121.90] This is cool.
[3122.16 → 3122.94] The Falcon Wing doors?
[3123.28 → 3123.60] No.
[3123.78 → 3124.72] Those are neat, I guess.
[3124.84 → 3128.66] But the bioweapon defence mode is freaking hilarious.
[3128.90 → 3130.24] I love how they name things.
[3130.28 → 3130.86] No, seriously.
[3131.04 → 3139.64] There's like a fresh air, a recirculate air, and then a biohazard symbol button that is apparently...
[3139.64 → 3146.04] It uses an air filter that is 10 times larger than a normal car's air filter that's designed
[3146.04 → 3149.80] to keep you safe in any situation where the air quality is questionable.
[3150.08 → 3150.24] Yeah.
[3150.24 → 3158.02] This is going to be a standard feature on every car in China in like the next six to eight years.
[3158.48 → 3158.68] Oh, wow.
[3158.68 → 3162.28] You could quote me on that one because that is like...
[3162.28 → 3166.04] If you can have a filtration system in your home and a filtration system in your car,
[3166.04 → 3168.92] if you live in Beijing, you probably should.
[3169.42 → 3169.48] Yep.
[3170.18 → 3170.46] Yep.
[3171.18 → 3172.32] LA too, for that matter.
[3172.58 → 3172.84] Yes.
[3173.00 → 3177.46] When the car is operating at max capacity, we can't even detect any viruses or bacteria
[3177.46 → 3178.26] or spores.
[3178.66 → 3179.92] It's like zero...
[3179.92 → 3181.06] You keep on clicking around.
[3181.14 → 3183.00] I can't read it because your name thing's in the way.
[3183.00 → 3185.04] Oh, sorry, sorry.
[3185.12 → 3185.72] I'm on the good luck.
[3185.72 → 3188.18] I mean, who else does this?
[3188.24 → 3188.88] Who else does this?
[3188.96 → 3189.54] Does anyone else...
[3189.54 → 3192.50] While you're reading, do you just kind of like do this?
[3192.68 → 3197.20] But on my screen, wherever his cursor is, it also has a line-up and then says, here,
[3197.24 → 3197.88] I'll move mine so you can see it.
[3197.88 → 3199.00] Yeah, I can see it.
[3199.24 → 3199.32] Yeah.
[3199.32 → 3200.90] So you see how it says the name?
[3201.24 → 3206.10] So it's like it's covering multiple words at a time and then moving around while I'm trying
[3206.10 → 3209.18] His cursor wars on Google Docs.
[3209.18 → 3212.98] That would be the most boring episode of anything ever.
[3213.82 → 3216.66] Anyway, it's like zero that came through.
[3216.78 → 3223.40] If there's ever an apocalyptic scenario of some kind, hypothetically, you just press the
[3223.40 → 3224.46] bioweapon defence button.
[3224.90 → 3226.00] This is a real button.
[3226.00 → 3229.44] Yeah, we're trying to be a leader in apocalyptic defence scenarios.
[3231.30 → 3235.44] Only a leader for the extraordinarily rich and elite, however.
[3235.44 → 3243.64] The 90D starts at $132,000 US dollars and the P90D starts at $142,000.
[3244.18 → 3248.24] So I won't be buying one of these for my family vehicle anytime soon.
[3248.50 → 3253.44] I don't see it on here, but I thought they were saying something about fitting within guidelines
[3254.06 → 3256.78] for like hospital quarantine rooms or something.
[3256.78 → 3257.40] Oh yeah, I'm not sure.
[3257.56 → 3259.34] Yeah, I think it was something like it's as clean as a hospital.
[3259.46 → 3260.54] I think it's a court that didn't end up in art.
[3260.54 → 3264.16] Air quality in the car is on the levels of a hospital room.
[3265.20 → 3266.92] Alright, moving on to our next topic.
[3267.52 → 3268.28] fixity.
[3269.52 → 3273.42] They got their app yanked from the Apple Store.
[3273.42 → 3281.42] They banned their developer account in response to their Apple TV teardown.
[3282.14 → 3285.94] To be fair though, in response, they were like, LOL, we don't care.
[3286.56 → 3288.18] We'll just work on our mobile site more.
[3288.18 → 3294.24] Like literally their developers were like, we were kind of thinking of doing that anyway.
[3294.44 → 3295.34] So waters.
[3295.58 → 3298.24] Which is awesome and the best response they could have had.
[3298.34 → 3300.46] They're not a sponsor of today's show, unfortunately.
[3300.70 → 3303.62] It would have been awesome if that particular star had aligned.
[3303.82 → 3305.38] But we love those guys.
[3305.50 → 3306.10] They're great.
[3306.34 → 3313.54] They believe in understanding your devices and being allowed to repair them yourself.
[3313.54 → 3319.74] So with that said, I also have to defend Apple a little bit here.
[3319.90 → 3331.78] Because fixity knew based on an agreement that they made with Apple that if they did this, Apple could take action against them.
[3331.84 → 3333.00] I don't think Apple was in the wrong.
[3333.12 → 3333.98] And they did it anyway.
[3334.20 → 3335.90] I just think fixity's response was perfect.
[3335.90 → 3336.18] Yeah.
[3336.38 → 3337.40] So there you go.
[3338.88 → 3339.64] fixity will just...
[3339.64 → 3339.96] Well, okay.
[3340.10 → 3342.28] I think they're in the wrong because they should let people do that.
[3342.58 → 3342.86] Yes.
[3342.98 → 3343.90] But they didn't like...
[3345.42 → 3350.98] This isn't like that bull crap with Pebble.
[3351.50 → 3358.82] Where right after the release of the Apple Watch, you couldn't refer to the Pebble app in your description or whatever.
[3358.82 → 3363.00] Like, I can't remember exactly what they did, but they've done some really stupid stuff.
[3363.22 → 3363.40] Yeah.
[3363.60 → 3365.34] But this wasn't it.
[3365.42 → 3366.64] It's just kind of funny.
[3367.00 → 3367.18] Yeah.
[3367.78 → 3368.74] All right.
[3369.34 → 3374.24] AdBlock extension begins whitelisting acceptable ads.
[3374.32 → 3379.78] This is actually something that I talked about on a recent episode of Fast as Possible.
[3379.78 → 3394.88] Where they've actually had this program in beta for quite some time when their community got together and made a list of requirements for what could be considered an acceptable ad.
[3394.96 → 3397.06] So something that doesn't take over the whole page.
[3397.56 → 3402.06] Something that doesn't, you know, turn up your freaking speakers and play at full volume.
[3402.06 → 3403.86] So pretty much like all the ads on our site.
[3404.02 → 3404.42] So yeah.
[3404.42 → 3411.58] Like pretty much the ads on our site for AdBlock users, which I believe is opt-in by default.
[3411.90 → 3412.24] Okay.
[3412.40 → 3417.42] AdBlock users would receive ads on our site, but I think we actually have to sign up.
[3417.54 → 3418.90] Like we have to submit and be audited.
[3419.14 → 3419.58] Oh, okay.
[3419.62 → 3421.14] For the acceptable ads program.
[3421.56 → 3425.42] But basically what it is...
[3425.42 → 3426.66] Here, hold on.
[3426.68 → 3428.32] I'm just going to go back to the details.
[3428.32 → 3440.58] If your ad is considered acceptable, then your ad will be shown to AdBlock users unless they go back in and manually opt-out of this program.
[3442.78 → 3445.78] It was also apparently sold to an anonymous buyer.
[3446.12 → 3446.36] Yeah.
[3446.48 → 3448.80] And we don't know who that is yet because they're anonymous.
[3448.80 → 3451.36] So there you go.
[3451.44 → 3453.70] Oh, there was a previous controversy.
[3454.20 → 3456.32] IO to the owner of Adblock Plus.
[3456.44 → 3459.88] So this is AdBlock using the Adblock Plus whitelist, to be clear.
[3460.32 → 3464.54] So IO had previously caused controversy by accepting payment from some whitelisted ad companies.
[3464.72 → 3467.34] It apparently is no longer the case.
[3467.40 → 3472.58] But I remember us talking about what a conflict of interest that created way back when that was happening.
[3473.24 → 3476.06] IO says they are not the buyer of Adblock Plus.
[3476.06 → 3480.70] So we don't know exactly what's going on, but there you have it.
[3482.90 → 3483.92] This is stupid.
[3484.58 → 3492.36] So yet another crowdfunding campaign for yet another phone that will never exist.
[3493.04 → 3495.12] I'm not even sure why this is in the dock.
[3495.20 → 3495.48] Oh, yeah.
[3495.50 → 3496.76] It's in the dock because I thought it was funny.
[3496.88 → 3497.00] Right.
[3497.08 → 3497.62] I don't remember why.
[3497.68 → 3498.40] I put it in here.
[3498.84 → 3502.32] Up to 256 gigabytes of storage.
[3502.92 → 3504.86] Six gigabytes of RAM.
[3504.86 → 3509.18] Snapdragon 820 24 megapixel camera.
[3511.70 → 3514.10] This is Symmetry.
[3514.60 → 3518.42] The no-compromised smartphone PC that you can use as a laptop.
[3519.96 → 3522.08] Because it is so powerful.
[3522.54 → 3524.34] Holy crap, this is a render.
[3524.56 → 3526.44] That's not a real product at all.
[3526.44 → 3526.72] Wow.
[3527.52 → 3532.16] So basically, guys, if you're buying a phone.
[3532.20 → 3533.34] Wow, that goal, though.
[3533.84 → 3534.28] Yeah, I know.
[3534.68 → 3535.42] I know we're near it.
[3535.56 → 3536.30] Is it flex funding?
[3536.54 → 3537.02] I don't know.
[3537.38 → 3538.10] Oh, my God.
[3538.14 → 3539.10] Can you check if it's flex funding?
[3539.12 → 3539.32] Yeah.
[3539.32 → 3540.80] Because they have like 50 grand already.
[3543.44 → 3543.76] Fixed.
[3543.76 → 3544.46] Fixed funding.
[3544.56 → 3544.82] Okay.
[3544.82 → 3554.20] So if you're buying a phone based on someone on Indiegogo or Kickstarter promising you that it's going to be really fast.
[3554.56 → 3555.96] It's going to be the bee's knees.
[3556.06 → 3557.78] It's going to have a lot of megapixels.
[3557.78 → 3559.22] You know what this would be really good for?
[3559.30 → 3559.92] Not to cut you off.
[3560.06 → 3565.88] But someone who's trying to buff up their marketing portfolio for a resume.
[3566.76 → 3567.04] Like.
[3567.30 → 3571.80] They could be like, look, I took a product that straight up didn't exist at all.
[3572.14 → 3573.54] That would never exist.
[3573.78 → 3575.26] Had no possibility of existing.
[3575.60 → 3577.00] And that no one had ever heard about.
[3577.60 → 3579.70] Set my goal at over a million dollars.
[3580.40 → 3584.98] And in four days, 114 people gave me over $50,000.
[3585.50 → 3586.58] You should hire me.
[3586.58 → 3587.18] Like.
[3588.26 → 3589.24] That's pretty impressive.
[3589.56 → 3595.48] If I was smart, I'd probably say that's because you promised them something you couldn't deliver.
[3595.74 → 3597.62] And that's not a viable business strategy.
[3597.94 → 3598.78] The door's over there.
[3599.40 → 3600.72] But I could see someone getting.
[3600.72 → 3601.44] But I could see someone picking them up.
[3601.44 → 3602.52] I could see someone getting hired.
[3603.28 → 3604.10] So basically.
[3604.32 → 3605.30] So back to what I was saying.
[3605.40 → 3610.36] If your plan is to buy a smartphone that projects that it will be available.
[3611.82 → 3612.60] When are they?
[3612.78 → 3614.30] August 2016.
[3614.30 → 3614.58] August 2016.
[3615.40 → 3616.70] So in 10 months.
[3616.70 → 3620.82] With like seemingly next gen specifications.
[3621.30 → 3623.50] Here's a freaking clue for you.
[3623.96 → 3627.18] Why don't you just wait until all the next gen phones are out.
[3627.74 → 3630.52] You'll have now until then to save the money instead of dropping it now.
[3630.74 → 3631.82] And you can get them then.
[3631.82 → 3638.64] We should talk about more interesting.
[3638.72 → 3639.00] Yes.
[3639.08 → 3639.56] There we go.
[3639.78 → 3639.96] Yeah.
[3639.98 → 3640.78] We're doing this one.
[3640.84 → 3642.90] So this is also a Kickstarter.
[3643.12 → 3644.64] Which as you guys know.
[3644.64 → 3646.80] I'm not a huge fan.
[3647.04 → 3649.40] I generally don't like giving them a ton of coverage.
[3649.40 → 3650.96] Or even talking about them at all.
[3651.40 → 3654.30] But this looks like it might be the real deal.
[3655.10 → 3659.52] So sort of just to give you guys sort of the full rundown.
[3659.72 → 3661.48] We have never been in touch with Scarp.
[3661.58 → 3662.92] I don't know anyone who works there.
[3663.24 → 3665.40] I hadn't even heard of this until Luke linked me to it.
[3665.40 → 3668.08] Shaving as we know it is for the must-beam.
[3668.20 → 3671.04] Because the laser starts completely level to the surface of the skin.
[3671.04 → 3671.18] Okay.
[3671.22 → 3671.94] So here's how it works.
[3672.02 → 3672.34] There you go.
[3672.40 → 3672.82] In a nutshell.
[3672.82 → 3682.08] There's a freaking laser beam that goes at a particular wavelength that cuts human hair but not skin.
[3682.38 → 3687.38] So you basically just scrape this thing along your face, and it removes your hair like freaking magic.
[3687.38 → 3693.92] What I've been talking about, not to like to give other people ideas yet, does I want them to send us one for review.
[3694.04 → 3695.28] I don't think they've responded yet.
[3695.64 → 3698.58] I had one of our guys email them because I thought it would be kind of fun to review.
[3698.68 → 3700.38] We reviewed the shaver a long time ago.
[3701.42 → 3706.30] And I was like, this is actually a lot more techie than the shaver is.
[3707.26 → 3709.26] Wow, that is a blast from the past.
[3709.52 → 3711.16] So here, I'll screen share.
[3711.28 → 3712.82] So this is what he's referring to.
[3713.18 → 3716.78] It's actually the fifth video that ever went up on the Linus Tech Tips channel.
[3716.78 → 3718.40] I find myself in a tricky situation.
[3718.58 → 3719.60] It is now 5.30.
[3719.74 → 3721.12] I get off work at 6.
[3721.38 → 3722.14] Hey, that's a cool shirt.
[3722.14 → 3726.46] At that time, I need to go directly to an appointment for a portrait.
[3726.70 → 3730.84] So this is like, I think this is like a week plus for me.
[3730.90 → 3733.02] And I still like that.
[3734.30 → 3735.32] I'm just going to mute this.
[3735.32 → 3736.52] This video is awesome.
[3736.80 → 3737.02] Yeah.
[3737.46 → 3739.60] I love how you're in front of a projector screen.
[3739.60 → 3741.52] But you can still see this show.
[3745.14 → 3746.30] What is this?
[3748.92 → 3750.02] The old intro.
[3750.54 → 3751.40] Oh, man.
[3751.46 → 3752.24] This is awesome.
[3752.34 → 3756.36] I get such a kick out of it when people are like, Linus, you're so unprofessional now.
[3757.16 → 3760.78] It's like, when was this golden age?
[3761.02 → 3762.76] What were you watching before?
[3762.76 → 3765.02] Where was this golden age of Linus Tech Tips?
[3765.14 → 3766.00] Look at these shoes.
[3766.52 → 3770.60] When was this golden age of Linus Tech Tips when you were watching when I was professional?
[3771.00 → 3771.32] Hold on.
[3771.34 → 3772.98] Where did you wear pants that weren't from Costco?
[3772.98 → 3773.96] Look at this computer.
[3774.38 → 3775.16] Look at this computer.
[3775.32 → 3776.30] It's got an optical driver.
[3776.30 → 3777.50] It's just hanging out.
[3781.50 → 3782.44] This is great.
[3782.76 → 3784.16] But anyway, we had reviewed.
[3786.08 → 3786.80] Oh, man.
[3786.88 → 3788.24] We had reviewed a USB shaver.
[3788.66 → 3789.72] And I was like, you know what?
[3789.72 → 3791.68] This thing actually looks super badass.
[3791.68 → 3794.08] I think actually makes sense on our channel now.
[3794.24 → 3795.66] Is the audio playing right now?
[3795.78 → 3796.02] No.
[3796.28 → 3796.46] No.
[3796.54 → 3797.24] You can talk over it.
[3797.54 → 3800.70] I think actually might make sense on...
[3800.70 → 3802.00] It didn't even do much.
[3802.62 → 3802.98] Well, no.
[3803.12 → 3804.48] Because it's...
[3804.48 → 3805.24] Oh, is it a trimmer?
[3805.26 → 3806.78] I had never used a shaver.
[3807.16 → 3807.40] Yeah.
[3807.76 → 3810.18] And I didn't realize they only really work on stubble.
[3810.50 → 3810.68] Yeah.
[3810.70 → 3814.58] If you want to use an electric shaver, you have to razor first.
[3814.70 → 3817.68] And then you can maintain with a shaver.
[3817.84 → 3819.52] So I spent forever.
[3819.84 → 3821.10] And it didn't really work ever.
[3821.10 → 3821.90] So...
[3821.90 → 3824.24] Also, it was like $5 or something.
[3824.34 → 3824.66] There you go.
[3824.66 → 3825.26] From Samba.
[3825.88 → 3826.92] But yeah, this thing's badass.
[3827.08 → 3828.96] And one of the things that I want to do...
[3828.96 → 3831.52] I want to review it to see how well it works.
[3831.60 → 3832.88] And I think it fits within the tech space.
[3832.96 → 3835.26] So I thought we should contact them and see how it goes.
[3836.22 → 3838.50] More as like an experimental video to see what people think.
[3838.62 → 3841.40] Apparently, people freaking care because of how...
[3841.40 → 3843.10] Yeah, they've raised like $2.5 million or something.
[3843.10 → 3847.56] Almost 15,000 people have backed them, and they've raised $2.8 million.
[3847.96 → 3849.66] Almost $2.9 million, actually.
[3850.46 → 3852.36] So I thought, okay, we should try to review it.
[3852.40 → 3865.26] And one thing that I want to try to do is work with Taryn and get a 3D printed mount to see if I can use it for shaving hair down instead of actually taking it completely off.
[3865.26 → 3865.50] Oh.
[3866.08 → 3868.24] Because they have it going right against your skin.
[3868.26 → 3871.00] So just like more like a grooming version.
[3871.34 → 3876.56] So like make our own custom 3D printed mount to lift it off your skin a little bit and then make it so you can...
[3876.56 → 3878.60] They might even just make an accessory for that.
[3878.70 → 3879.44] I could see them doing that.
[3879.46 → 3880.44] Yeah, it's not in the Kickstarter.
[3880.74 → 3883.86] So I could definitely see it as like a longer term thing.
[3883.86 → 3884.66] So you just...
[3884.66 → 3885.86] You could even...
[3885.86 → 3886.34] Wouldn't be that hard to do.
[3886.34 → 3887.06] You could just clip on.
[3887.18 → 3890.38] So you could just be like here, here and like, you know, the places that...
[3890.38 → 3892.98] And then sort of everywhere else.
[3893.16 → 3893.22] Yeah.
[3893.22 → 3894.18] That'd be kind of cool, actually.
[3894.18 → 3897.50] So I thought that could just be kind of fun to do in the video.
[3897.80 → 3901.38] I can see this company just making a fortune because...
[3901.38 → 3901.84] You know what though?
[3902.00 → 3905.08] I think they're largely targeted towards...
[3905.08 → 3909.40] Not really, but like all the people in the video are men.
[3909.52 → 3913.20] And the stylistic design of the thing looks very masculine.
[3913.38 → 3913.70] Very masculine.
[3913.70 → 3916.10] But I think way more chicks are going to be interested in this.
[3916.20 → 3916.84] And I get it.
[3917.16 → 3917.38] Yep.
[3917.56 → 3920.70] If you're shaving your legs, which most guys don't do...
[3920.70 → 3923.02] Which is an awful lot of surface area to deal with.
[3923.12 → 3924.08] This would be so...
[3924.08 → 3925.40] You could just whip it by.
[3925.62 → 3925.84] Yep.
[3925.96 → 3927.26] You don't have to worry about cutting yourself.
[3927.28 → 3928.30] It's waterproof, which is cool.
[3928.42 → 3930.50] So you can use it in the shower, which is super amazing.
[3930.86 → 3931.28] Like...
[3931.28 → 3931.80] Yeah.
[3932.26 → 3933.50] I mean, it...
[3933.50 → 3934.38] So it's got...
[3934.38 → 3936.42] The laser has a life of 50,000 hours.
[3936.64 → 3938.02] And it's powered by an AAA battery.
[3938.48 → 3941.64] And the founder has been in the laser hair and skin treatment industry for 30 years.
[3941.70 → 3945.04] Now, with all of this said, it's still a Kickstarter.
[3945.42 → 3946.76] It's still not a real product.
[3947.10 → 3947.32] Yep.
[3947.42 → 3948.38] Let's see how it goes.
[3948.38 → 3949.30] I didn't back it.
[3949.54 → 3950.80] I find it incredibly interesting.
[3951.02 → 3954.56] And if it actually works as well as they show, I will definitely have one.
[3954.78 → 3955.00] Right.
[3955.04 → 3956.50] But I didn't back it because it's a Kickstarter.
[3956.66 → 3957.40] I'm going to wait until it comes out.
[3957.46 → 3959.46] I'm not worried about it not getting funding.
[3959.84 → 3961.44] Their goal was 160,000.
[3961.60 → 3964.84] They've made 2.9 basically million dollars.
[3965.02 → 3965.16] Yeah.
[3965.16 → 3966.34] So I'll just wait.
[3966.52 → 3967.24] There's no point.
[3967.42 → 3969.90] Honestly, at this point in time, I don't see any real reason.
[3970.02 → 3971.76] All the early bird deals are gone.
[3971.86 → 3972.08] Right.
[3972.48 → 3975.12] So I'd be buying it for a lot.
[3975.78 → 3976.08] Yep.
[3977.06 → 3978.58] So whatever.
[3979.12 → 3979.96] March 2016.
[3980.20 → 3980.88] I'll just wait until then.
[3981.50 → 3982.10] All right.
[3982.18 → 3983.14] We've got a couple more things.
[3983.26 → 3984.80] This is sort of a big deal.
[3985.96 → 3988.26] Amazon, don't be douches.
[3988.54 → 3988.90] Please.
[3989.82 → 3991.58] Like, just please don't be douches.
[3991.64 → 3992.32] Did you post this already?
[3992.42 → 3992.88] No, I didn't.
[3992.88 → 4000.08] Amazon is banning Apple TV and Chromecast sales on their site.
[4000.84 → 4002.14] So they've quietly informed.
[4002.44 → 4003.26] It's not just.
[4003.34 → 4006.32] You can't buy it with Prime directly shipped by Amazon.
[4007.42 → 4014.58] It has informed marketplace sellers that as of October 29th, it will no longer sell Chromecast or Apple TV.
[4014.84 → 4015.36] That's annoying.
[4015.54 → 4017.38] What the actual crap, guys?
[4017.38 → 4021.28] I'm sorry that Fire TV is stupid and that nobody cares about it.
[4021.28 → 4024.40] But this is really not the way to go about this.
[4024.54 → 4028.42] I'm like, your stuff doesn't even work in freaking other countries.
[4028.68 → 4029.84] Get over yourself.
[4030.36 → 4031.46] Like, we can't even use.
[4031.60 → 4032.30] What is that even.
[4032.56 → 4033.44] What is the thing called?
[4033.54 → 4034.70] The Amazon whatever.
[4035.70 → 4036.84] The tower thing.
[4036.84 → 4039.38] So, the Amazon spokesperson.
[4039.56 → 4043.40] Over the last three years, Prime Video has become an important part of Prime.
[4043.56 → 4049.20] It's important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion.
[4051.28 → 4051.72] Wow.
[4052.10 → 4054.34] The biggest load of bull crap ever.
[4054.34 → 4060.56] I hope that they reverse this decision between now and October 29th or whatever the date I just said was.
[4060.90 → 4063.36] Because that is super, super stupid.
[4063.68 → 4066.90] I really hope this turns into an anti-competition lawsuit.
[4067.26 → 4070.70] Because this is one of those cases where it really would be justified.
[4072.04 → 4073.00] I mean, yes.
[4073.08 → 4074.14] I know it's your store.
[4074.44 → 4076.42] And you get to decide what's stocked on your shelves.
[4076.92 → 4078.48] Even if you have a section of your store.
[4078.48 → 4080.36] Okay, so you go to Home Depot, right?
[4080.44 → 4082.92] And there's a Harvey's or a Subway or whatever inside it.
[4082.92 → 4086.74] They get to decide, you know, hey, we want a Subway there.
[4086.82 → 4087.62] We want a Harvey's.
[4088.38 → 4094.60] But it's just kind of crappy to just lock out what is effective.
[4094.74 → 4096.24] I mean, is it even a competing product?
[4096.40 → 4096.74] Come on.
[4097.88 → 4100.80] Like, in order to be competing, it would have to be competitive.
[4102.14 → 4102.40] Yeah.
[4102.98 → 4103.34] Yeah.
[4103.60 → 4107.12] I was bringing up the Amazon Echo you can't even use in Canada.
[4107.12 → 4113.88] Yeah, we had to send it down to our fastest possible writer down in the States to try out a bunch of the stuff for us.
[4114.38 → 4116.24] And then he's going to send it back to us.
[4116.38 → 4120.34] And we're going to compile our review based on his notes and stuff like that.
[4120.44 → 4121.16] And he's good.
[4121.22 → 4122.56] He's been writing for us for a long time.
[4122.60 → 4123.24] And that's fine.
[4123.34 → 4125.02] It's just we shouldn't have to deal with that kind of crap.
[4126.52 → 4131.14] YouTube to potentially announce its subscription service in October.
[4133.38 → 4136.80] So the original article here is from Recode.net.
[4137.12 → 4140.70] So they are apparently prepping their subscription launch.
[4140.88 → 4143.58] Two services, one price.
[4144.16 → 4145.42] What this will mean?
[4146.04 → 4147.94] It's, well, I don't know.
[4148.00 → 4149.98] Not necessarily 100% clear.
[4150.46 → 4153.42] They were aiming, apparently, for a mid-summer 2015 launch.
[4153.48 → 4154.70] That clearly didn't happen.
[4154.70 → 4157.12] It's possible the launch date could keep slipping.
[4157.56 → 4162.48] And it's speculated that they also intend to bundle YouTube Music Key with their ad-free video service.
[4162.56 → 4163.52] So that's the way it would work.
[4163.86 → 4165.58] Is you would subscribe to YouTube.
[4166.32 → 4174.00] Industry sources say Google has told them it intends to charge $10 a month for the combined music and ad-free YouTube offering.
[4174.00 → 4180.66] Although that's sort of hard to believe because I thought the music service was just about $10 on its own.
[4180.82 → 4181.34] Yeah, I thought it was $8.
[4181.74 → 4189.10] Anyway, so the point is you will be able to pay a subscription to YouTube and then not see any ads on the site.
[4189.18 → 4194.82] That is to say unless unscrupulous content creators bake their own ads into their videos and force you to watch those.
[4194.82 → 4200.28] So they can collect their own sponsorship dollars and Google can't have their 40% cut of that.
[4200.36 → 4201.52] I wouldn't know anyone like that, though.
[4201.76 → 4201.98] Rip.
[4208.02 → 4218.80] With that said, content owners have been told through a blast email that they have to agree to the new terms by October 22nd or their videos will no longer be available for public display.
[4218.84 → 4220.34] I haven't seen said email.
[4220.70 → 4221.76] I have a YouTube rep.
[4222.32 → 4224.44] So I haven't heard anything about this, but there you go.
[4224.82 → 4225.26] Hmm.
[4226.86 → 4227.66] What else we got?
[4227.80 → 4231.54] Oculus VR will cost more than $350.
[4233.94 → 4234.34] Fascinating.
[4235.40 → 4235.80] Okay.
[4236.86 → 4242.28] So Palmer explains why the first consumer model won't come cheap.
[4242.52 → 4243.68] You want to run through this one?
[4243.96 → 4245.86] I actually had no idea.
[4246.00 → 4247.02] You didn't know this yet?
[4247.26 → 4247.58] No.
[4247.78 → 4248.26] Oh, okay.
[4248.34 → 4249.48] Okay, I'll run through this one then.
[4249.48 → 4254.98] So in a nutshell, it's been confirmed that it'll cost more than $350.
[4255.48 → 4261.12] The reason is that it has more tech than the DK1 and DK2 days.
[4261.12 → 4261.74] Yeah, of course.
[4261.74 → 4269.30] I think we probably expected this back when Oculus freaked out a little bit when they saw Lighthouse on the HTC, what's it called?
[4269.38 → 4269.72] The Five?
[4269.92 → 4271.90] Yeah, back on the HTC Five.
[4271.90 → 4283.02] And he wants it to be the best it can be, even if this means it'll carry a premium price tag, to set an example for all VR headsets.
[4283.02 → 4283.84] And that is important.
[4283.84 → 4289.12] But I remember the whole pitch back when the Facebook acquisition took place.
[4289.22 → 4293.24] It was like, yeah, thanks to Facebook's investment, we can keep the price low.
[4293.40 → 4293.56] Yeah.
[4297.16 → 4299.24] To be fair, though, I'm not that surprised.
[4299.24 → 4301.48] Because, like, there are headphones now.
[4301.94 → 4304.04] And the stand camera is nicer.
[4304.44 → 4312.56] And a stand camera, instead of, like, just this, like, crappy thing that hooks onto the top of your monitor and weighs not enough.
[4312.78 → 4316.02] So the cables always pull it and torque it to the side.
[4316.28 → 4319.48] And it drives me insane because it never sits flat on top of the monitor.
[4319.70 → 4321.12] I have to, like, tape it or glue it on.
[4321.20 → 4325.08] And then that's weird because then I have residue on top of my monitor, and I'm just not happy about it.
[4325.08 → 4326.76] And then now there's a stand camera.
[4327.26 → 4327.94] And it's better.
[4327.94 → 4331.14] And, like, the headband thing is a lot nicer now.
[4331.38 → 4334.56] Like, they improved the materials in almost every way.
[4334.86 → 4336.72] They improved the cameras now, stand camera.
[4337.16 → 4338.14] Yes, we got that.
[4338.20 → 4338.62] Thank you.
[4338.76 → 4339.24] There we go.
[4339.64 → 4343.52] There's little, like, fold-down headphone things now, which are trash.
[4343.86 → 4344.94] Please don't use them.
[4345.18 → 4349.70] I remember not that long ago, freaking Palmer was like, oh, yeah, they're great.
[4349.76 → 4350.40] I'm an audiophile.
[4350.50 → 4351.38] They're fantastic.
[4351.38 → 4355.04] They're, like, those, they actually sound okay.
[4355.04 → 4358.96] But the problem is that there's those, like, pad headphone things.
[4359.56 → 4365.16] Yeah, so they're, like, those TDK, like, $10 at London Drugs when you're desperate, and you're travelling.
[4365.16 → 4366.74] So, like, for what they are, I was like, oh, wow.
[4366.80 → 4370.32] I'm surprised this doesn't sound like literally throw-up pouring into my ears.
[4370.32 → 4376.04] But, like, they're still padded, like, they come out on angles off your ear, and it's just, like, this isn't ideal.
[4376.40 → 4377.98] So, get your own headphones.
[4378.24 → 4389.62] Okay, I'm going to let you finish, but I love, I love, I absolutely love the argument of, no, these things are great.
[4389.74 → 4390.64] I'm an audiophile.
[4391.70 → 4393.62] Audiophile literally means nothing.
[4393.92 → 4394.76] It's not a diploma.
[4394.76 → 4399.80] I don't remember if that's exactly how he said it, but it was, like, I remember reading that and being, like, okay.
[4399.94 → 4405.90] No, but I was reading comments on the Beats by 50-Star Wars rap video that we did a long time ago.
[4406.58 → 4415.30] And I've got people saying, like, oh, first, oh, man, one of my favourites was, everyone else on the internet says that these are great, so I'm pretty sure this guy has paid off.
[4417.20 → 4418.16] No, that was one of the beats.
[4418.18 → 4419.14] It was Streets by 50.
[4419.26 → 4419.44] Sorry.
[4420.02 → 4420.76] Those where trash.
[4421.68 → 4422.56] I know, they were awful.
[4422.56 → 4423.04] What?
[4423.04 → 4427.30] And then, and then, and then, there's, there's always the comments, it's like, I'm an audiophile, and these are great.
[4428.34 → 4429.30] Let's break it down.
[4429.42 → 4430.82] I'm going to break it down for you, okay?
[4431.38 → 4434.04] Audio means audio.
[4435.36 → 4437.12] File means love.
[4439.06 → 4440.22] Audio, love.
[4440.30 → 4442.16] I like audio, and these are great.
[4442.22 → 4443.04] It's not a certificate.
[4443.58 → 4448.04] It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't give you any sort of, like, industry credentials.
[4448.04 → 4449.24] It just means you.
[4449.24 → 4452.82] You should take part-time education and, like, get an audio engineering degree.
[4453.84 → 4455.68] Just to troll the whole internet.
[4455.82 → 4457.30] You know I can't do the math.
[4457.44 → 4457.60] It would be way too much.
[4457.60 → 4457.62] Wait.
[4458.62 → 4459.92] I can help you with that.
[4460.20 → 4461.96] Would you just do the math homework for me?
[4462.00 → 4462.30] Yeah.
[4462.30 → 4464.40] We can show up to test together.
[4467.56 → 4469.80] Because I can do, I can do conceptual stuff.
[4470.06 → 4470.24] Yeah.
[4470.34 → 4471.52] I got no problem with that.
[4471.54 → 4472.10] Yeah, yeah.
[4472.32 → 4477.70] But, like, you put an equation in front of me, and I'm like, I can just, like, three.
[4478.00 → 4479.36] I hope the answer's zero.
[4479.56 → 4480.62] I hope it's one of those.
[4480.62 → 4486.90] I hope you have to do a bunch of calculations, and it's just zero.
[4487.70 → 4489.36] Anytime, we can make it, like, an online course.
[4489.44 → 4494.02] Anytime we have to go in for a test, we can just get, like, a makeup artist to make it look like we're Siamese twins.
[4494.32 → 4496.12] Like, just pretend to graph my head to your shoulder.
[4496.12 → 4497.02] That would fly.
[4500.82 → 4502.80] Like, no, this is, this is, this is how it goes.
[4502.94 → 4504.28] Yeah, this is, this is real, man.
[4504.40 → 4504.58] Yeah.
[4504.96 → 4506.32] Um, all right.
[4507.64 → 4508.40] Oh, man.
[4508.40 → 4513.48] So, um, someone's saying Pedro equals walk.
[4513.78 → 4514.14] Pedometer?
[4514.62 → 4515.06] No, no.
[4515.48 → 4516.30] That's foot.
[4517.56 → 4518.52] PED is foot.
[4519.74 → 4522.36] Well, pod is foot, but I'm pretty sure it is.
[4522.48 → 4522.92] Oh, crap.
[4523.04 → 4523.94] Is PED walk?
[4524.28 → 4525.36] Because pod is foot.
[4525.66 → 4525.94] Uh-oh.
[4526.38 → 4527.12] I don't know.
[4527.12 → 4529.60] Okay, well, I hope I, I hope I didn't screw that up.
[4530.14 → 4531.84] It says they have audio file network cables.
[4531.90 → 4536.50] All right, and on that note, thank you guys for tuning into the WAN show.
[4536.50 → 4539.12] We hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.
[4539.54 → 4542.02] Um, we'll see you again next week.
[4542.10 → 4543.76] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4543.92 → 4545.08] Maybe the same time.
[4545.10 → 4547.88] I hope you guys, hopefully not the same time.
[4548.12 → 4552.72] Um, hopefully, oh, yeah, also, uh, hopefully let us know if you guys like what we've done
[4552.72 → 4553.20] with the set.
[4553.36 → 4557.54] We actually pulled the table out a fair bit more, so you can see a lot more of what's
[4557.54 → 4558.40] going on back there.
[4558.48 → 4562.92] Personally, I think it looks like the bee's knees, but, uh, I could be, uh, you know,
[4562.98 → 4563.82] I could be, I could be wrong.
[4563.82 → 4564.84] Looks pretty good, Mythical Morning.
[4564.84 → 4566.42] We're not quite there, but we're getting close.
[4566.74 → 4567.56] Yeah, it does look.
[4567.56 → 4568.76] Still some work to be done, I think.
[4568.84 → 4572.04] Yeah, still, still a little bit to be done, but it's pretty darn good.
[4572.14 → 4572.90] I'm, I'm liking it.
[4572.90 → 4573.04] Yeah.
[4573.34 → 4574.42] Here, tell me this.
[4574.50 → 4575.84] Does this help or hinder?
[4578.28 → 4579.62] I think it helps a lot.
[4580.02 → 4582.60] Should we put the CRT up higher?
[4584.90 → 4585.50] Uh, what?
[4585.60 → 4585.80] This one.
[4585.80 → 4586.78] Oh, probably.
[4587.14 → 4590.70] One problem that I think it has right now is it's a very much a dark void.
[4591.36 → 4592.06] The CRT.
[4592.66 → 4593.60] No, the whole thing.
[4593.60 → 4594.76] Oh, well, we can light it better.
[4595.26 → 4596.42] No, I know, but that's, that's what I'm saying.
[4596.48 → 4600.82] Like, like the, like the black racking and the dark wood and then the.
[4600.94 → 4602.56] Maybe we should wear bright shirts.
[4602.84 → 4603.46] That might help.
[4604.10 → 4605.22] I bet that would help a lot.
[4605.80 → 4607.72] We should be doing this kind of thing on After Party.
[4607.92 → 4608.26] Probably.
[4608.46 → 4608.76] Okay.
[4609.12 → 4609.34] Bye-bye.
[4609.66 → 4609.94] Bye.
[4609.94 → 4610.04] Bye.

[4615.70 → 4616.42] Section.
[4617.42 → 4617.82] Fuck.
[4619.50 → 4621.00] Can we allow that?
[4621.38 → 4621.52] No.
[4621.52 → 4621.58] No.
[4621.58 → 4621.60] No.
[4621.60 → 4621.74] No.
[4621.74 → 4621.78] No.

[4622.12 → 4622.14] No.
[4622.14 → 4623.04] No.
[4623.04 → 4623.08] No.
[4623.08 → 4623.58] No.
[4623.60 → 4625.70] No other job.
[4625.70 → 4625.82] Yeah.
[4625.82 → 4628.24] We'll be fine with the vlog.
[4638.60 → 4639.70] I don't know what we're going to do.
[4639.78 → 4640.60] lug ares.
[4640.64 → 4641.68] َI Union
[4641.68 → 4643.18] People knew specific, but they could do things.
[4643.18 → 4643.94] Like the next came out of in order, by defending API's post on 72nd, but on capture

[4645.52 → 4646.24] As long as it would.
[4646.24 → 4646.90] I liked Juchitán.

[4648.94 → 4651.02] I noticed this game was about to say them actually about Garage for without bur esters Is

[4651.50 → 4652.56] I said very mysterious festival.
[4652.56 → 4652.92] I had to get the PLU constantly, but I brought in apart this event on where Estes so they're afraid are
[4652.92 → 4653.38] Everybody still as if you're sails, but I'm convinced of oceans like But I was going to stake it kind of
