[0.00 --> 4.38]  You are now streaming live to Twitch!
[4.46 --> 7.02]  You're not, we are. I mean, you could be, but...
[7.02 --> 11.52]  Live from Canada, but also pushed somewhere else, so actually from somewhere else, kind of.
[11.96 --> 14.28]  Yeah, where are we broadcasting from?
[14.84 --> 16.40]  It's like a friggin' mystery.
[17.46 --> 20.46]  You know what else is a mystery? What is this show even about?
[20.60 --> 27.14]  Well, we're gonna put that mystery down to pasture with a bullet right now.
[27.22 --> 27.52]  Point.
[27.52 --> 30.96]  Point. There aren't even bullet points on the dock.
[31.10 --> 35.76]  No, this is the kind of lazy crap that I have to deal with around here.
[36.22 --> 37.64]  No bullets.
[38.62 --> 42.00]  How are we gonna kill this show today with no bullets?
[43.28 --> 45.84]  That's a dash. That's a dash.
[46.08 --> 50.00]  You know what a dash is? A speedy substitute for a bullet.
[51.00 --> 55.04]  I can't change it. I don't know how to fix it on Google Docs.
[55.04 --> 59.04]  AMD seizes mantle optimization. That's topic number one today.
[59.58 --> 64.70]  Star Citizen's creatively named FPS module Star Marine is having some issues.
[65.16 --> 66.88]  Maybe it's underwater.
[66.88 --> 71.30]  Why would that... Oh.
[71.30 --> 71.36]  Oh.
[73.36 --> 74.42]  I'm sorry.
[76.02 --> 76.54]  Ew.
[76.88 --> 81.28]  You sounded so disappointed. It made my joy juices flow.
[82.28 --> 82.84]  Sorry.
[83.32 --> 84.42]  That's not really what I meant.
[84.42 --> 88.14]  Okay, I think most...
[88.14 --> 89.38]  They made me spit out joy juices.
[89.38 --> 92.38]  I think most of the spit actually landed on the monitor, so it's okay.
[92.96 --> 93.44]  Sorry.
[93.74 --> 94.86]  NVIDIA reveals new GPUs.
[94.86 --> 95.46]  I'm turning red.
[96.50 --> 100.68]  Warner Brothers knew that Arkham Knight for PC was a mess months ago and didn't do anything about it.
[101.26 --> 102.68]  Woo! Intro time!
[102.84 --> 103.14]  Yeah!
[103.14 --> 105.08]  I have way too much energy today.
[105.14 --> 105.68]  That's cool.
[105.80 --> 106.68]  Where is my intro?
[107.56 --> 109.10]  Why is it not playing?
[109.62 --> 110.76]  Intro didn't work.
[111.26 --> 111.94]  I don't know.
[112.32 --> 113.68]  This is a bad song.
[114.48 --> 117.04]  We can make the intro work if we drag the right thing into the box.
[117.04 --> 117.44]  Yeah, no.
[117.88 --> 118.94]  No, I am determined.
[119.12 --> 120.06]  This is happening.
[120.36 --> 121.58]  Try to make the thing work.
[121.72 --> 122.48]  This is happening.
[122.90 --> 123.30]  Boom!
[123.86 --> 124.22]  Boom!
[125.22 --> 126.14]  It'll work now.
[126.54 --> 127.18]  Swamp butt.
[127.32 --> 128.30]  Clenching hard enough.
[128.30 --> 129.30]  Clenching hard enough.
[129.30 --> 133.06]  Did you clench so hard, you died?
[134.60 --> 135.74]  Would that be possible?
[136.64 --> 138.08]  Well, is that kind of what happened?
[138.08 --> 138.86]  Maybe.
[138.86 --> 139.36]  Maybe.
[139.36 --> 144.04]  Or is that a god?
[145.32 --> 152.08]  You know, the idea behind this whole thing was that as we could have used to play games all the time, we ended up with two.
[153.98 --> 154.94]  And aren't they the wrong color?
[155.96 --> 157.38]  No, no, that's fine.
[157.44 --> 157.96]  Oh, they are now?
[157.96 --> 158.72]  They're right now?
[158.82 --> 158.98]  No.
[159.18 --> 160.36]  Oh, these outro.
[160.52 --> 160.98]  No, no.
[161.06 --> 162.42]  The sponsor things are a mess.
[162.44 --> 163.18]  You mean the intro?
[163.34 --> 164.18]  Yeah, the intros.
[164.38 --> 167.98]  Like, we were going to do, like, we were going to walk across different landscapes all the time.
[168.48 --> 169.72]  And it just never happened.
[169.78 --> 174.14]  In Ed's defense, he's been extremely busy turning Linus Tech Tips into...
[174.14 --> 174.72]  A fire pole?
[174.82 --> 176.56]  Pretty much not a fire...
[176.56 --> 177.14]  I don't even...
[177.14 --> 178.86]  No, we are not talking about fire poles today.
[179.18 --> 184.92]  He's been turning Linus Tech Tips into what a lot of people are considering, like, worthy of being a bonafide TV show.
[184.92 --> 202.14]  So, for those of you who have already seen Scrapyard Wars 2E on Vessel, and for those of you who are waiting for it on YouTube, honestly, overall, like, considering the size of the team we have working on a project like that, yeah, we're extremely proud of it.
[202.14 --> 208.56]  And I hope you guys are looking forward to or enjoyed the final part, depending on how that whole thing went.
[209.06 --> 209.36]  Yes.
[209.52 --> 214.42]  So, this was posted by Krak7 on the forum.
[214.60 --> 215.08]  Krak.
[215.78 --> 216.30]  Krak.
[216.54 --> 216.98]  Krak.
[217.42 --> 219.48]  This link is bogus.
[219.98 --> 220.48]  What is happening?
[220.48 --> 221.76]  It's like a bogus journey.
[222.16 --> 224.24]  What is going on with my cursor?
[225.20 --> 228.70]  If it doesn't start cursing better, I'm going to start cursing.
[228.70 --> 235.08]  I'm going to get the link shared in the, yeah, the link is going to be, people on Twitch are going to be on that website before you are.
[235.58 --> 237.32]  Unless, no, I'm not logged in, so you'll win.
[237.94 --> 238.34]  Yes.
[238.62 --> 239.34]  Never mind.
[239.42 --> 240.14]  Get wrecked, bro.
[240.58 --> 241.16]  All right.
[241.32 --> 245.78]  So, this is a link to the AMD Fury review.
[245.78 --> 249.36]  Hopefully there's something about Mantle Fury X, excuse me.
[250.08 --> 250.92]  Something, something.
[251.06 --> 251.78]  Well, you know what?
[251.88 --> 252.22]  Whatever.
[252.68 --> 254.80]  An on tech probably talked about it at some point.
[254.96 --> 257.08]  So, we called it.
[257.84 --> 258.54]  I called it.
[258.54 --> 259.52]  You probably called it.
[259.94 --> 261.32]  Did we collectively call this?
[261.38 --> 261.60]  Yeah.
[262.52 --> 268.04]  AMD has confirmed that while they are not outright dropping Mantle support.
[268.22 --> 269.86]  That is such a great way of putting it.
[270.32 --> 273.98]  It's like, we are not outright dropping support for oxygen.
[273.98 --> 274.60]  We're not going to remove it.
[275.22 --> 277.08]  Yeah, we're not going to remove the oxygen.
[277.70 --> 279.94]  We're just not going to replenish it.
[280.82 --> 282.38]  So, yeah.
[282.38 --> 282.48]  Yeah.
[284.98 --> 286.52]  They're not dropping Mantle support.
[286.66 --> 290.28]  They have simply ceased all further Mantle optimization.
[291.38 --> 296.00]  So, the Mantle driver has not been optimized at all for GCN 1.2.
[296.00 --> 299.70]  Is that equivalent to like our efforts on installing a fire pole?
[300.46 --> 300.86]  Yes.
[301.02 --> 306.06]  We have completely, well no, it's slightly different in that there was never going to be a fire pole.
[307.06 --> 311.04]  So, the Mantle driver has not been optimized at all for GCN 1.2.
[311.04 --> 317.70]  That means R9 Fury X, R9 285, R9 380, and the Carrizo APU.
[318.22 --> 320.84]  Mantle is essentially deprecated at this point.
[320.94 --> 324.08]  And while AMD isn't going out of their way to break backwards compatibility,
[324.34 --> 326.82]  they aren't going to put resources into helping it either.
[328.14 --> 330.52]  Mantle was never going to work.
[330.78 --> 332.18]  It was a cool idea.
[332.18 --> 338.18]  I think I even, like I waffled about this a lot.
[339.34 --> 341.48]  And I actually, you know what?
[342.54 --> 343.94]  What are we looking for right now?
[344.06 --> 344.22]  Oh.
[344.44 --> 345.32]  This is kind of embarrassing.
[345.50 --> 348.16]  I don't remember if I ever made an AMD Mantle video.
[348.38 --> 349.14]  Yes, I did.
[349.34 --> 353.92]  So, I did make an AMD Mantle fast as possible on TechQuickie.
[354.12 --> 355.58]  And you can even tell.
[355.92 --> 358.14]  A year ago, this many people were interested.
[358.14 --> 363.18]  And three months ago, this many people gave a crap about DirectX 12 and Vulkan.
[363.86 --> 366.40]  Some of this is because TechQuickie has grown.
[366.74 --> 368.96]  Some of this is because Mantle never really mattered.
[369.08 --> 370.14]  Because it was like...
[370.66 --> 371.14]  There was like...
[371.76 --> 374.64]  There was always a list of games that were getting support.
[375.64 --> 379.48]  There was never games where it actually mattered.
[379.96 --> 384.44]  Like, Battlefield 4 with Mantle was just difficult to benchmark.
[385.28 --> 386.44]  There was no benefit.
[386.44 --> 388.28]  It was just there.
[388.28 --> 392.54]  Unless you played on that one aircraft carrier mission where everything was breaking and
[392.54 --> 393.24]  sliding to the left.
[393.64 --> 394.82]  Then there was a little bit.
[395.36 --> 395.76]  Right.
[396.00 --> 396.78]  In single player.
[397.58 --> 404.38]  So, Mantle was never going to succeed until an actual industry standard, supported by everything
[404.38 --> 412.16]  and everyone, DirectX 12, managed to take that whole concept of dramatically improving CPU
[412.16 --> 419.30]  overhead and draw call performance and was actually everywhere so that game developers could
[419.30 --> 421.14]  legitimately design their games for everyone to play.
[421.18 --> 423.38]  Because we already run into this.
[423.72 --> 426.58]  Where the PC doesn't get a game.
[427.04 --> 431.00]  Because developers can't justify the additional cost of porting it.
[431.00 --> 436.60]  And I mean, whether that's due to piracy concerns or whether that's due to just being obstinate
[436.60 --> 437.64]  buttheads.
[437.64 --> 442.16]  You know, you look at how much of an impact it's had on Ubisoft's business over the last
[442.16 --> 445.08]  few years to actually release their games on PC.
[445.08 --> 445.28]  Yeah.
[445.28 --> 451.44]  So, whatever the reasons, you look at how it sometimes happens that the PC doesn't get
[451.44 --> 454.54]  that's with all PCs included.
[454.84 --> 458.82]  So, you want to start breaking it down and going, oh, well, you have to do extra work
[458.82 --> 460.90]  for AMD PCs or like, you know.
[460.90 --> 465.96]  That's what I think a lot of software but mainly hardware developers don't understand
[465.96 --> 470.48]  when they're releasing new things that are like, oh, this is very, very game changing
[470.48 --> 472.86]  but you have to use like our SDK.
[473.14 --> 475.16]  You have to use a FISX accelerator.
[475.64 --> 476.28]  Yeah.
[476.52 --> 483.32]  Even when NVIDIA took the FISX onto the GPU with their 65 or 70% discrete market share.
[483.54 --> 485.76]  They still can't sell that.
[486.40 --> 491.36]  They still can't do it because it's not ubiquitous.
[491.54 --> 491.70]  Yeah.
[492.14 --> 497.48]  I mean, NVIDIA has gotten away with some things with GameWorks, for example.
[497.48 --> 502.80]  But that involves them handing it finished to the game developer, basically.
[502.80 --> 505.50]  Take this, plug it into your game.
[505.58 --> 511.18]  It makes it look better on our GPUs and theoretically doesn't harm performance on someone else's GPU,
[511.32 --> 513.50]  especially if you don't turn the feature on, which I guess is true.
[513.50 --> 517.74]  Oh, interesting.
[520.16 --> 524.22]  There is a shirt that has been released.
[524.68 --> 524.98]  Released?
[524.98 --> 528.04]  Actually, there's a couple of interesting shirt news related items.
[528.16 --> 533.52]  So number one is if you got a Linus Tech Tips hashtag first shirt and it was red.
[534.14 --> 534.80]  Don't worry.
[534.94 --> 538.42]  You probably also got an email, unless you didn't get an email, in which case I'm telling you now.
[538.42 --> 542.66]  You probably also got an email from Teespring saying that some of the shirts were printed red,
[543.00 --> 545.12]  which you already knew because you got a red one, right?
[545.44 --> 545.88]  Yeah.
[546.18 --> 550.36]  So you probably already got a shirt that's red, unless you didn't order one,
[550.38 --> 552.98]  in which case you won't have gotten any shirts, and I sincerely apologize.
[553.88 --> 559.14]  But Teespring will be resending, at their own cost, properly colored shirts.
[559.44 --> 560.20]  Teespring bro.
[560.32 --> 562.44]  To those of you who got red shirts.
[562.60 --> 563.20]  That's cool.
[563.30 --> 564.92]  Which is good, because I got red shirts.
[565.16 --> 565.56]  Did you?
[565.56 --> 566.74]  I ordered four shirts.
[568.32 --> 568.90]  They're red.
[570.36 --> 575.22]  Can the CEO of a company wear a shirt that's the wrong color?
[576.18 --> 577.40]  I don't think so.
[578.60 --> 580.00]  But you know I'd do it anyway.
[580.36 --> 581.22]  Probably, yeah.
[581.80 --> 583.66]  You'd be like, oh, well, I've worn this one for two weeks.
[583.74 --> 584.34]  Time to change it.
[584.60 --> 585.78]  So good guy Teespring.
[586.20 --> 587.52]  They are making it happen.
[587.74 --> 591.74]  No one is being forced to return the red shirts, which is pretty nice.
[591.74 --> 595.82]  And we also have a new shirt to announce today.
[596.08 --> 600.92]  Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with fire poles, which is fortunate.
[601.74 --> 602.60]  It kind of does.
[603.16 --> 605.80]  It has nothing to do with fire poles.
[605.80 --> 606.10]  It kind of does.
[606.10 --> 608.38]  It has nothing to do with fire poles.
[608.38 --> 609.14]  Just a little bit.
[609.26 --> 611.06]  Which is nothing to do with fire poles.
[611.08 --> 612.46]  Just a very small amount.
[612.46 --> 615.32]  This, my friends.
[615.72 --> 617.52]  You're not logged in, so this is taking forever.
[618.36 --> 618.60]  Yeah.
[620.20 --> 621.22]  Well, this is weird.
[621.32 --> 625.38]  I'm clicking log in, and it's not doing a thing.
[625.70 --> 627.52]  I don't even know the password.
[628.26 --> 630.78]  That is the ultimate in password security.
[631.08 --> 632.42]  Not knowing it.
[632.42 --> 637.38]  Did you know why this thing that they're going to figure out very soon?
[637.84 --> 640.16]  Actually, they'll catch up by the time you post it, probably.
[640.16 --> 642.18]  No, I'm not ready to post it yet.
[642.18 --> 643.82]  I'm doing a straw pole first.
[644.00 --> 646.74]  Are you going to buy this shirt?
[647.66 --> 648.58]  Yes, no.
[649.36 --> 654.00]  The usual option that everybody loves so very much.
[654.22 --> 654.34]  Turnip.
[654.50 --> 659.60]  So, this, my friends, is the new shirt design.
[660.54 --> 666.16]  It is on teespring.com slash vote for turnip.
[666.16 --> 666.76]  Turnip.
[667.42 --> 669.30]  And the straw pole, my friends.
[669.96 --> 672.68]  Apparently, this is only a 10-day campaign.
[673.30 --> 673.86]  10 days?
[674.02 --> 678.80]  Mr. Nick Light is getting aggressive about his campaign periods.
[679.10 --> 679.98]  That's intense.
[680.22 --> 681.08]  That is intense.
[681.18 --> 685.10]  That is not a lot of time to decide to buy one.
[685.10 --> 690.34]  Did we sell seven in the time that we've been sitting here?
[690.72 --> 692.02]  Showing it to people?
[692.02 --> 693.02]  Maybe.
[695.08 --> 695.76]  I have no idea.
[695.76 --> 695.94]  No, wait.
[696.02 --> 696.70]  No, it doesn't say.
[696.80 --> 698.84]  Apparently, we only set a reserve of three.
[699.60 --> 703.70]  So, who is planning to buy this shirt?
[704.08 --> 705.02]  Reserve of three.
[705.42 --> 709.22]  We have a massive 63% of you saying turnip.
[709.96 --> 712.20]  With 28% of you saying no.
[712.20 --> 715.74]  Oh, and only 10% of you saying yes.
[715.82 --> 718.02]  Apparently, Nick Light would like to join us on the WAN show.
[721.04 --> 721.76]  Hello, caller.
[721.86 --> 722.72]  You're on the WAN show.
[722.80 --> 724.40]  Hey, um, it's not actually...
[724.40 --> 725.60]  No, caller, caller, you're gonna...
[725.60 --> 729.48]  Caller, I'm afraid your belligerent tone is simply not going to work for this show.
[729.48 --> 734.86]  Can you, uh, can you just compose yourself and call us back once you are more calm, sir?
[738.60 --> 739.04]  Hey.
[740.88 --> 741.36]  Okay.
[741.36 --> 745.64]  Sir, I'm afraid these comments about my mother are simply not going to be tolerated.
[748.70 --> 750.34]  Sorry, you can talk now.
[750.36 --> 750.84]  It's okay.
[751.02 --> 752.70]  Am I on speaker or what?
[752.78 --> 754.00]  You are totally on speaker.
[754.64 --> 755.02]  Okay.
[755.40 --> 757.52]  Um, the campaign's not actually 10 days.
[757.60 --> 759.56]  It just wouldn't let me set a higher amount.
[759.62 --> 762.04]  It's gonna be like 20-something, 24 days probably.
[762.68 --> 763.08]  Oh.
[763.08 --> 765.84]  I've already emailed our rep, so he's gonna extend it when he can.
[765.84 --> 767.90]  Um, but yeah.
[767.90 --> 769.02]  No, it's up there.
[769.64 --> 773.14]  Unfortunately, 4-F-O-R wouldn't work, so I had to use a 4.
[773.74 --> 774.12]  Sorry.
[774.82 --> 777.14]  Well, you wouldn't be the first person to take that shortcut.
[777.14 --> 778.86]  Yeah, exactly.
[779.02 --> 779.18]  Okay.
[779.30 --> 780.32]  Anyway, that's all I had to say.
[780.42 --> 781.78]  It's not actually a 10-day campaign.
[781.90 --> 782.22]  It's longer.
[782.70 --> 783.06]  Okay.
[783.24 --> 783.76]  Thank you.
[784.28 --> 784.84]  Okay, bye.
[784.88 --> 785.66]  Enjoy your day off.
[786.38 --> 786.68]  Okay.
[786.86 --> 787.18]  Bye.
[787.54 --> 787.76]  Oh.
[787.98 --> 788.22]  Nope.
[788.22 --> 789.38]  Oh, you missed him.
[789.38 --> 790.24]  He didn't get a buy.
[790.44 --> 791.48]  Uh, what is he talking about 4?
[792.16 --> 793.62]  Uh, oh, the, uh...
[793.62 --> 794.38]  Is it printed on there with a 4?
[794.38 --> 797.34]  The link is vote for turnip.
[797.88 --> 800.68]  Which, in my mind, is really not that big of a deal.
[800.90 --> 801.12]  That's fine.
[801.46 --> 802.16]  So, uh...
[802.16 --> 803.50]  You wouldn't just click it anyways.
[803.72 --> 804.00]  Yeah.
[804.16 --> 806.64]  The reason why this has a little bit to do with the Firepole...
[806.64 --> 808.04]  It has nothing!
[808.28 --> 808.58]  Okay.
[808.76 --> 811.00]  If you go to firepole.co...
[811.00 --> 811.70]  Shut up.
[811.76 --> 812.62]  Is there...
[812.62 --> 814.18]  Did you create this?
[814.20 --> 815.06]  I did not, actually.
[816.00 --> 817.66]  I'll go to firepole.co.
[817.66 --> 818.70]  I didn't do it.
[818.80 --> 823.14]  I will take the bait, and I will go to firepole.co.
[823.56 --> 823.80]  Nope.
[826.22 --> 826.70]  Whoa!
[826.96 --> 827.22]  No.
[827.44 --> 827.94]  LL.
[829.76 --> 830.20]  Firepole.
[830.42 --> 830.70]  Yeah.
[831.20 --> 832.28]  I see.
[832.86 --> 833.20]  Yeah.
[834.20 --> 834.72]  There you go.
[834.72 --> 837.72]  The firepole strawpole pole.
[839.14 --> 841.54]  Yes, should Linus install a firepole?
[841.72 --> 842.70]  Yes, no turnip.
[842.70 --> 848.02]  And we are getting a massive 77% voting for yes.
[848.70 --> 849.06]  Okay.
[849.30 --> 849.64]  Okay.
[849.76 --> 850.06]  Okay.
[850.16 --> 850.46]  Okay.
[850.84 --> 851.36]  All right.
[851.44 --> 852.64]  We have to address it at some point.
[852.64 --> 854.84]  The firepole is very funny.
[855.48 --> 856.18]  It's amusing.
[856.88 --> 858.64]  Would I enjoy a firepole?
[858.92 --> 859.38]  Yes.
[859.38 --> 879.16]  In fact, before Luke trolled the crap out of everyone on the entire internet with his BS about firepoles in the new office vlog, before that happened, I actually created an MS Paint drawing of the new office that did include, among other things, a firepole.
[879.16 --> 888.84]  It is a joke that I personally heartily enjoy, but I am going to educate you guys about some business realities.
[889.80 --> 890.96]  We're not firefighters.
[891.80 --> 894.34]  We don't need a firepole.
[894.98 --> 897.10]  Arguably, firefighters don't need firepoles.
[897.30 --> 897.70]  Right.
[898.04 --> 901.20]  So if they don't need them, then we definitely don't need them.
[901.32 --> 902.84]  Thank you for feeding into my point.
[903.24 --> 908.16]  Also, firepoles come with a not insignificant liability concern.
[908.16 --> 910.16]  Can you imagine?
[910.92 --> 924.42]  Can you imagine the look on the workers' compensation, you know, agent's face when, you know, Taron has a repetitive strain injury due to repeatedly going down the firepole?
[924.42 --> 933.62]  And they ask him, what exactly does descending a pole have to do with your daily work activities as a video editor?
[933.62 --> 939.82]  To which he would have no reply, he would receive no compensation, and he would be poor with a broken wrist.
[940.00 --> 941.28]  Is that what you want?
[941.30 --> 944.64]  If we pointed a camera at it, could it be a super fun prop?
[944.64 --> 949.18]  Tell you what.
[951.02 --> 960.32]  If nobody ever rides it, not once, I will consider putting it in.
[960.52 --> 961.16]  Okay.
[961.16 --> 964.70]  But if anyone rides it, I will remove it.
[965.70 --> 966.74]  Could you resist?
[967.54 --> 971.28]  Or is it just better for us to say it wasn't meant to be?
[971.48 --> 973.52]  So if we don't point a camera at it.
[974.02 --> 977.72]  I think as an alternative, you should enroll Luke in some pole dancing classes.
[977.84 --> 980.52]  Yes, I think that's our new strawpole.
[980.54 --> 980.82]  It's good for core strength.
[980.82 --> 984.78]  I'm not even kidding.
[984.98 --> 987.80]  Luke pole dancing lessons.
[987.92 --> 989.04]  It's good for core strength.
[989.06 --> 990.86]  Yes, no turnip.
[991.00 --> 991.62]  Whatever, man.
[991.72 --> 992.30]  Super fun.
[992.70 --> 995.80]  That could actually be a very excellent super fun.
[996.04 --> 998.58]  LMG pole dancing lessons.
[999.34 --> 1000.30]  I'll film for that one.
[1000.36 --> 1000.78]  I volunteer.
[1001.58 --> 1003.06]  Luke Berkel volunteers to film.
[1003.14 --> 1004.30]  The hell you will.
[1004.88 --> 1006.52]  You're participating, smart guy.
[1006.68 --> 1007.46]  I'm on to you.
[1007.70 --> 1009.06]  I think you'd actually do the best.
[1009.06 --> 1011.44]  You think I would do the best in pole dancing?
[1011.70 --> 1013.90]  I think your weight to strength ratio is probably pretty good.
[1014.02 --> 1014.52]  You know what?
[1014.58 --> 1016.08]  I look a lot stronger than I am.
[1016.78 --> 1017.78]  Yeah, but like...
[1017.78 --> 1019.08]  My left arm is weak sauce.
[1019.28 --> 1021.30]  The Knicks and I aren't going to be able to...
[1021.30 --> 1022.54]  Right, you guys are pretty top heavy.
[1022.84 --> 1023.10]  Yeah.
[1023.94 --> 1025.76]  So Luke pole dancing lessons.
[1025.86 --> 1029.02]  We've got a massive 81% voting for yes.
[1029.12 --> 1031.22]  If you're paying for it, I'm not going to say no.
[1032.58 --> 1034.20]  So what else does that apply to?
[1035.22 --> 1036.18]  You know that.
[1037.04 --> 1037.40]  God.
[1037.40 --> 1039.36]  Should we do some actual topics?
[1039.50 --> 1041.20]  We've been on the air for 20 minutes.
[1044.42 --> 1044.98]  Okay.
[1046.16 --> 1046.76]  Question.
[1048.18 --> 1051.86]  Are you on the air if your entire broadcast...
[1053.06 --> 1053.50]  Wi-Fi.
[1053.86 --> 1054.68]  ...is over...
[1054.68 --> 1054.96]  Wi-Fi.
[1055.98 --> 1057.92]  So you're on someone's air.
[1058.12 --> 1058.34]  Yeah.
[1058.52 --> 1059.70]  But it's not the air.
[1060.38 --> 1061.86]  But the broadcasting station...
[1063.78 --> 1066.22]  It goes straight to air!
[1066.22 --> 1067.58]  But the mic would go through a cable.
[1069.08 --> 1073.30]  So you're saying the air between the microphone and my mouth qualifies as air?
[1073.44 --> 1075.18]  Everything has a cable at some point.
[1076.08 --> 1078.02]  Everything has a cable at some point?
[1078.26 --> 1079.06]  Internally, possibly.
[1079.20 --> 1080.88]  I could show you something that doesn't have a cable.
[1081.02 --> 1081.40]  Wow.
[1082.74 --> 1083.26]  Actually...
[1083.26 --> 1083.90]  My belt!
[1084.28 --> 1084.64]  Okay.
[1085.00 --> 1085.62]  No cable.
[1085.62 --> 1086.98]  Well...
[1086.98 --> 1088.62]  That's possibly true.
[1088.80 --> 1090.08]  But what about thread fibers?
[1090.84 --> 1091.74]  Thread fibers.
[1092.54 --> 1093.00]  You know...
[1093.00 --> 1093.26]  Hmm.
[1093.42 --> 1093.62]  Okay.
[1093.70 --> 1098.58]  So we actually did a fastest possible on wires versus...
[1099.52 --> 1100.06]  Cables.
[1100.48 --> 1101.72]  Wires versus cables?
[1101.98 --> 1102.52]  I think so.
[1102.54 --> 1102.86]  I think so.
[1102.94 --> 1103.54]  Yes, we did.
[1103.56 --> 1104.12]  It was that stuff.
[1104.12 --> 1104.52]  No.
[1104.72 --> 1106.84]  So a thread is too small.
[1107.06 --> 1108.80]  Because a cable...
[1108.80 --> 1111.72]  The size of it, the girth of it is implied.
[1117.18 --> 1117.66]  Okay.
[1118.98 --> 1119.58]  Um...
[1119.58 --> 1120.58]  Okay, so...
[1120.58 --> 1128.20]  Sony launches First Flight crowdfunding site, which basically appears to be a way for Sony
[1128.20 --> 1130.38]  to get funding for new products because...
[1130.38 --> 1130.64]  This is brutal.
[1130.94 --> 1131.84]  They're out of money.
[1132.16 --> 1133.14]  It's only in Japan.
[1133.40 --> 1134.68]  The website design is horrible.
[1134.94 --> 1136.48]  OP here is goodbytes.
[1136.56 --> 1137.12]  Let's go ahead.
[1137.26 --> 1137.96]  I'll, uh...
[1137.96 --> 1139.28]  Have you dropped this in, uh...
[1139.28 --> 1140.64]  No, I'm moving on it.
[1140.82 --> 1143.22]  I'm gonna pull this up on BitTech here.
[1143.22 --> 1146.86]  So I'm gonna link this in chat, but you guys need to Google Translate it.
[1147.02 --> 1148.16]  So just a heads up.
[1148.16 --> 1154.40]  So First Flight's initial campaign is for a customizable remote control based on a low-power
[1154.40 --> 1156.16]  electrophoretic...
[1156.16 --> 1157.16]  Electro...
[1157.16 --> 1158.90]  Electrophoretic, excuse me.
[1159.00 --> 1159.74]  I misread that.
[1160.06 --> 1165.74]  E-paper display, similar to the Harmony family, except probably not functional at all because
[1165.74 --> 1170.88]  even Logitech couldn't figure out a multifunction remote on their own and acquired Harmony with
[1170.88 --> 1172.92]  their years and years of expertise.
[1173.52 --> 1177.76]  Knowing Sony, it'll work with, you know, your Sony TV and your Sony receiver and your
[1177.76 --> 1178.70]  Sony Discman.
[1178.76 --> 1179.60]  And your PlayStation.
[1180.04 --> 1184.50]  That you definitely have all of, like, the compatible ecosystem products for.
[1184.58 --> 1184.92]  Okay, no.
[1185.00 --> 1185.76]  It's probably actually meant to be...
[1185.76 --> 1189.14]  Maybe you could use the remote to use your cell phone, which should just be the remote
[1189.14 --> 1189.54]  anyways.
[1189.72 --> 1189.76]  It's probably...
[1189.76 --> 1191.72]  It's probably meant to be universal.
[1191.90 --> 1192.40]  But...
[1192.40 --> 1196.70]  And to be clear, universal remotes have gotten a lot better in recent years, with even some
[1196.70 --> 1198.56]  phone apps being pretty darn impressive.
[1199.56 --> 1202.18]  So, yeah.
[1202.48 --> 1207.70]  I mean, this, to me, is even more reprehensible than...
[1207.70 --> 1208.50]  Reprehensible.
[1208.50 --> 1210.78]  No, I mean, I think it's the right word.
[1210.94 --> 1216.58]  Because, like, an indie product developer, like, someone like a Pebble, and I'm not talking
[1216.58 --> 1218.00]  the most recent Pebble campaign.
[1218.08 --> 1219.92]  I'm talking when they were actually a small company.
[1220.42 --> 1229.46]  You know, getting crowdfunding and not contributing equity back to the investors, funders, you kind
[1229.46 --> 1229.96]  of get it?
[1230.52 --> 1231.12]  Kind of.
[1231.72 --> 1235.66]  This is, like, a multinational corporation.
[1235.96 --> 1236.20]  Yeah.
[1236.42 --> 1240.44]  Not giving equity back to crowdfunders.
[1240.86 --> 1241.12]  Yeah.
[1242.98 --> 1243.46]  So...
[1243.46 --> 1244.50]  Who is remote?
[1247.76 --> 1248.48]  I don't know.
[1248.56 --> 1249.36]  It's kind of weird.
[1249.52 --> 1250.42]  It's only in Japan.
[1250.56 --> 1251.58]  That's something that we have to remember.
[1252.02 --> 1252.18]  Yeah.
[1252.58 --> 1253.66]  Japan exclusive right now.
[1253.66 --> 1255.40]  And, like, apparently there's zero plans.
[1255.66 --> 1257.84]  Yeah, no plans to launch elsewhere at all.
[1257.84 --> 1259.76]  So, it's not really that important.
[1259.84 --> 1262.42]  It's just interesting that a large company went this route.
[1262.80 --> 1265.60]  I guess it's not the strangest thing that's ever happened in Japan.
[1265.88 --> 1266.04]  No.
[1267.06 --> 1267.76]  Definitely not.
[1267.96 --> 1268.72]  Definitely not.
[1269.14 --> 1270.48]  Or even at Sony, really.
[1272.66 --> 1274.04]  Um, so...
[1274.04 --> 1277.16]  Oh, we didn't actually publish the YouTube announce.
[1277.32 --> 1279.10]  I saw you, like, kind of looking at it.
[1279.18 --> 1280.76]  I couldn't tell if it was public or not.
[1281.20 --> 1282.10]  I thought it was public.
[1282.10 --> 1287.66]  But that's okay, because you, the 2,800 people here now, you guys are the real MVP.
[1288.32 --> 1288.62]  Yeah.
[1289.06 --> 1289.40]  Yeah.
[1290.16 --> 1291.50]  Most valuable.
[1291.96 --> 1294.12]  And now that those other people are showing up, you're the MVPs.
[1294.24 --> 1295.14]  Everyone's an MVP.
[1295.76 --> 1296.50]  Most valuable.
[1296.54 --> 1297.26]  Everyone's an MVP.
[1297.42 --> 1300.76]  We actually appreciate everyone who views our content.
[1301.00 --> 1306.10]  I've had a lot of people ask me, like, for something like WAN Show, where it's available,
[1306.24 --> 1307.28]  a lot of different ways.
[1307.40 --> 1308.78]  You can watch live on Twitch.
[1308.98 --> 1311.16]  You can watch the archive on YouTube.
[1311.16 --> 1312.66]  You can listen on SoundCloud.
[1312.72 --> 1313.56]  Which most people don't know about.
[1313.92 --> 1314.94]  We need to talk about that more.
[1314.94 --> 1316.18]  Yeah, which most people don't know about.
[1316.24 --> 1317.64]  In fact, it's the funniest thing.
[1317.86 --> 1321.38]  Isn't there still, like, an unofficial thread in the forum?
[1321.58 --> 1321.90]  Probably.
[1321.92 --> 1324.54]  Where people are uploading audio versions of the WAN Show podcast?
[1324.54 --> 1326.24]  And they probably get more downloads than the SoundCloud.
[1326.44 --> 1326.66]  Yeah.
[1326.82 --> 1331.86]  So, every single WAN Show, when it's archived on YouTube, has a link to SoundCloud under
[1331.86 --> 1333.02]  it, if you just want it.
[1333.06 --> 1336.54]  And I enable download rights for all of them, so you can just download them and listen to
[1336.54 --> 1337.00]  them at your leisure.
[1337.00 --> 1340.70]  So, a lot of people ask me, what's the best way to support you guys to watch?
[1341.08 --> 1344.90]  Quite frankly, I think the most profitable is on Twitch?
[1345.96 --> 1347.04]  I'm actually not sure.
[1347.44 --> 1349.10]  I actually don't know.
[1349.40 --> 1350.50]  Do you get anything from Twitch?
[1350.82 --> 1351.62]  Yeah, I think so.
[1351.76 --> 1354.08]  Well, we don't specifically run ads, so it's not a ton.
[1354.26 --> 1358.32]  But I'm pretty sure the ad that people get when they tune in, because we don't do, like,
[1358.36 --> 1359.18]  mid-roll ads or anything.
[1359.26 --> 1359.80]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1359.80 --> 1361.96]  Yeah, so I'm pretty sure Twitch is the...
[1361.96 --> 1362.88]  Do you recollect that?
[1363.42 --> 1363.92]  I don't know.
[1364.54 --> 1365.20]  I don't think so.
[1365.20 --> 1366.54]  I'm not in charge of finances.
[1367.04 --> 1368.00]  We're not a partner.
[1368.50 --> 1370.50]  We don't have a sub button or chat emotes.
[1370.52 --> 1371.30]  No, we are a partner.
[1372.54 --> 1375.42]  Well, I'm pretty sure we do.
[1375.42 --> 1379.78]  Because when I asked for partnership for my channel, which is still in limbo because the
[1379.78 --> 1385.32]  new office isn't built yet, reasons, he was like, I can give you all the partner stuff,
[1385.52 --> 1388.68]  because all of the things, the only reason why I really wanted it was quality control.
[1388.84 --> 1389.14]  Right.
[1390.60 --> 1394.30]  He's like, I can give you, like, this suite of things, or this suite of things, or this suite
[1394.30 --> 1396.82]  of things, and I was like, I'll just, whatever, I'll just take all of it.
[1397.68 --> 1398.94]  But we don't have any of it.
[1399.10 --> 1399.42]  Right.
[1401.02 --> 1402.06]  We used to get checks.
[1402.08 --> 1402.20]  What?
[1402.30 --> 1403.58]  Do we have quality control?
[1403.64 --> 1404.18]  I think we do.
[1404.26 --> 1404.70]  I don't know.
[1407.18 --> 1407.86]  I don't know, bro.
[1407.86 --> 1409.12]  This computer is so slow.
[1409.80 --> 1411.00]  Oh my god.
[1411.20 --> 1412.06]  I don't know.
[1412.10 --> 1412.94]  It just needs a format.
[1413.16 --> 1413.34]  Okay.
[1413.40 --> 1414.18]  So I think maybe.
[1414.36 --> 1414.62]  Okay.
[1414.74 --> 1416.80]  So at any rate, I don't know.
[1416.90 --> 1419.24]  But the point is, we just want you guys to watch.
[1419.56 --> 1420.38]  Everyone's the MVP.
[1420.58 --> 1421.64]  We love it when you guys watch.
[1421.94 --> 1426.36]  That's me digging myself out of the hole where I position some of our viewers as more important
[1426.36 --> 1428.16]  than others because that is not the case.
[1428.64 --> 1430.00]  We love all of our viewers equally.
[1430.14 --> 1430.64]  Like children.
[1430.64 --> 1434.58]  And secretly, all parents love some of their children more.
[1435.00 --> 1436.58]  They just won't talk about it.
[1436.76 --> 1437.60]  You're a parent now.
[1437.64 --> 1438.34]  Which one is it?
[1439.52 --> 1440.90]  I can't talk about it.
[1442.74 --> 1443.18]  Alright.
[1443.18 --> 1450.18]  So NVIDIA unveils plans for GTX 950 series range of GPUs.
[1450.92 --> 1453.18]  So original article here is from kitguru.net.
[1454.08 --> 1456.06]  Let's go ahead and pop this baby up.
[1457.16 --> 1459.92]  And I think this is rumor at this point.
[1459.92 --> 1468.18]  Exact specifications for the GTX 950 and 950 Ti or Ti, as the cool kids call it, are unknown.
[1468.70 --> 1470.42]  But it's highly likely that...
[1470.42 --> 1470.76]  Oh, wow.
[1470.82 --> 1473.34]  This is some super rumor stuff going on here.
[1473.76 --> 1479.26]  It's likely they will have more than 640 but less than 1,024 stream processors.
[1482.84 --> 1483.80]  Huge gap.
[1485.28 --> 1486.88]  So, yeah.
[1486.88 --> 1487.14]  Yeah.
[1488.86 --> 1489.94]  So basically...
[1489.94 --> 1490.56]  So, yeah.
[1490.62 --> 1493.44]  It's funny because basically what they've done is they've created a chart.
[1493.70 --> 1494.06]  Yeah.
[1494.18 --> 1494.98]  This is brutal.
[1495.48 --> 1499.74]  960 and like the old 750 Ti and 750 that they'd be replacing.
[1499.90 --> 1501.60]  And they kind of, yeah, probably somewhere in there.
[1502.14 --> 1502.84]  Good guess.
[1503.06 --> 1504.66]  Yes, probably somewhere in there.
[1505.00 --> 1509.18]  It's safe to say that they'll be somewhere in the sort of 150 or lower range.
[1509.18 --> 1512.64]  And they will deliver up-to-date features like DirectX 12.1.
[1512.72 --> 1517.80]  Not that you'll be really enjoying any of the, you know, uber rendering features of DirectX 12.1
[1517.80 --> 1523.24]  on a low-end first of a generation of DirectX capable cards anyway.
[1524.34 --> 1528.66]  One of my favorite parts of that post on KGuru was at the very bottom where it was like,
[1528.72 --> 1530.70]  NVIDIA did not comment on this news story.
[1530.70 --> 1535.32]  It's like, the headline is NVIDIA preps low-cost graphics.
[1536.34 --> 1536.70]  Maybe.
[1537.24 --> 1542.14]  And then whoever star coaster, that is a misleading headline that you posted online.
[1542.22 --> 1543.08]  It's techtips.com.
[1543.14 --> 1544.50]  NVIDIA unveiled nothing.
[1545.20 --> 1545.98]  Got us.
[1546.40 --> 1549.68]  So, it's going to feature H.265 encoding and decoding.
[1549.82 --> 1553.54]  Fully compatible with HTC P 2.2 content protection over HDMI 2.0.
[1554.18 --> 1555.16]  And, yeah.
[1555.32 --> 1557.70]  So, it'll be like better than the old things proportionally.
[1557.70 --> 1563.48]  Proportionally according to how much better Maxwell replacements were for the other old things in all likelihood.
[1564.48 --> 1565.22]  And power efficient.
[1565.92 --> 1567.40]  In case you weren't concerned about that.
[1567.92 --> 1571.82]  Speaking of power efficient, we've got a couple cool videos coming out this week.
[1572.16 --> 1576.26]  Fury X versus 980 Ti in the SG-13.
[1578.34 --> 1580.36]  So, it's a small form factor case.
[1580.64 --> 1582.24]  We learned a bunch of really cool stuff.
[1582.24 --> 1586.64]  So, number one is that open test benching.
[1587.38 --> 1589.08]  I think our, I think its days are over.
[1589.62 --> 1589.76]  Really?
[1589.76 --> 1592.18]  I think we're going to have to switch to in-case test benching.
[1592.46 --> 1604.64]  Because the results, the prevailing results out there for Fury X versus 980 Ti do not necessarily align with the results that I get in a closed, a more enclosed environment.
[1605.16 --> 1605.70]  And, yes.
[1605.70 --> 1607.46]  Well, did you use the working Fury X this time?
[1607.48 --> 1607.80]  I did.
[1608.02 --> 1608.26]  Okay.
[1608.26 --> 1612.28]  A small form factor case is not the be all and end all of computers.
[1612.40 --> 1616.70]  A lot of people have big towers where an air-cooled card will do better.
[1617.28 --> 1626.50]  But, now that GPU Boost and whatever AMD calls their Turbo Wing are such a key part of the performance of a graphics card,
[1627.06 --> 1631.94]  the actual system the card is installed in becomes a major factor.
[1631.94 --> 1636.58]  Speaking of systems, we're actually getting a system for review for the first time.
[1638.28 --> 1640.34]  Digital Storm is sending us a Bolt 3.
[1640.68 --> 1641.10]  Oh, cool.
[1641.26 --> 1647.10]  So, we're going to be able to evaluate what I consider to be one of the coolest pre-built out there.
[1647.20 --> 1650.24]  Because it's legitimately different from what people can build by themselves.
[1650.82 --> 1654.64]  I mean, the differentiating factor is predominantly the case, of course.
[1654.64 --> 1657.10]  But that's always been the case.
[1657.48 --> 1657.80]  Oh!
[1658.40 --> 1658.72]  Whoa!
[1659.12 --> 1659.48]  Great!
[1659.82 --> 1667.74]  A problem with the case needed to test graphics cards thing is we're going to have to pick mediums.
[1667.82 --> 1669.30]  And you're probably going to have to do more than one case.
[1670.00 --> 1670.24]  Yep.
[1670.70 --> 1674.82]  Because, like, that little Silverstone case is going to perform much differently than some other one.
[1674.94 --> 1678.38]  So, I don't actually have a clear answer as to how we'll do that.
[1678.38 --> 1680.36]  We might just have to go,
[1681.44 --> 1685.64]  Okay, everyone who's a gamer has a Fractal ArcMidi R2.
[1687.36 --> 1689.78]  And that's how it's going to be.
[1690.12 --> 1690.96]  Deal with it.
[1691.14 --> 1692.04]  You know, sunglasses.
[1696.90 --> 1697.34]  Boop.
[1699.10 --> 1700.40]  That was actually pretty good.
[1700.90 --> 1702.82]  I was watching it in here so I could see it properly.
[1703.26 --> 1704.00]  That was fantastic.
[1704.30 --> 1706.44]  So, we'll have to figure out a strategy.
[1706.44 --> 1708.36]  But I can say it was an unexpected result.
[1708.46 --> 1711.74]  And then I have another really cool one coming that really threw me for a loop.
[1711.82 --> 1717.30]  I used a high-speed camera to take our highest-end G-Sync monitor, our 144Hz ROG Swift,
[1717.66 --> 1722.70]  and our highest-end FreeSync monitor, our XL2730Z from BenQ,
[1723.28 --> 1725.34]  and a Fury X versus a 980 Ti.
[1725.88 --> 1731.00]  And I used a high-speed camera to detect the latency between clicking the mouse
[1731.00 --> 1734.68]  and a muzzle flash in the animation of Crysis 3.
[1734.68 --> 1738.10]  And the results raised more questions than they answered.
[1739.26 --> 1744.44]  But that's all I can say about it for now because that's all I can say about it for now.
[1744.56 --> 1745.52]  You'll have to watch the video.
[1747.78 --> 1748.58]  Stop asking.
[1749.10 --> 1750.06]  No one's asking anything.
[1750.16 --> 1750.50]  Nobody.
[1750.92 --> 1751.20]  Literally no one.
[1751.20 --> 1752.72]  Because they haven't seen it yet, probably.
[1752.98 --> 1757.46]  Nexus posted this on the forum.
[1757.60 --> 1758.90]  I've already posted the link.
[1759.00 --> 1759.96]  Don't worry about it.
[1759.96 --> 1765.88]  I realize it's actually pretty fast for me to just do that on my way to pasting it into the browser.
[1766.04 --> 1766.78]  It is, actually.
[1767.08 --> 1767.70]  It's okay.
[1767.82 --> 1769.86]  But sometimes I forget, which is why it's good to have you here.
[1769.86 --> 1770.92]  And it's smoother now.
[1771.06 --> 1775.58]  So the Star Citizen FPS module is delayed for the foreseeable future.
[1775.72 --> 1780.48]  Wow, that is two video ads above the fold on one page.
[1780.50 --> 1781.30]  For the same thing.
[1781.44 --> 1785.10]  If you don't want to see it in widescreen, you can see it in a little box.
[1785.10 --> 1788.12]  I finally saw that movie I wanted to see.
[1789.28 --> 1789.76]  Avengers.
[1790.50 --> 1791.46]  Age of Ultron.
[1791.60 --> 1791.82]  Okay.
[1792.06 --> 1792.62]  Is that what it's called?
[1793.00 --> 1793.82]  Yeah, one of those.
[1794.14 --> 1794.92]  Yes, I enjoyed it.
[1794.96 --> 1796.28]  It was far superior to Fury.
[1797.84 --> 1799.92]  Far superior to Fury!
[1800.86 --> 1802.62]  Burkle doesn't even watch Marvel movies.
[1803.10 --> 1803.40]  Whoa.
[1803.52 --> 1803.68]  Yeah.
[1804.06 --> 1805.60]  He's like...
[1805.60 --> 1807.00]  Oh, I am Burkle.
[1807.12 --> 1808.02]  I am a snob.
[1808.12 --> 1809.54]  I do not watch Marvel movies.
[1810.10 --> 1813.30]  You know what I really enjoyed, surprisingly really enjoyed, was Kingsman.
[1814.14 --> 1814.84]  Haven't seen it.
[1814.84 --> 1815.24]  Kingsman.
[1815.36 --> 1816.04]  Kingsman, yeah.
[1816.92 --> 1817.74]  It's ridiculous.
[1818.28 --> 1819.40]  The whole movie is just ridiculous.
[1820.52 --> 1821.74]  I would probably enjoy it.
[1821.90 --> 1822.74]  Sounds like my kind of thing.
[1822.78 --> 1826.54]  I was talking to Brandon about it and trying to describe it and he was just very confused.
[1826.68 --> 1827.64]  And I was like, just watch it.
[1827.78 --> 1831.14]  And it was in the plane and he burst out laughing many times on the plane.
[1831.40 --> 1832.50]  Just absolutely ridiculous.
[1833.08 --> 1834.10]  Anyways, moving on.
[1834.10 --> 1835.32]  So, it's delayed.
[1835.60 --> 1840.44]  They showed it off at a, like, backers press event thing at, I believe, PAX East in April.
[1840.58 --> 1840.76]  Yeah.
[1841.06 --> 1842.62]  They demonstrated the module there.
[1842.62 --> 1847.82]  The problem isn't that the module isn't working very well because it was actually working fairly
[1847.82 --> 1852.48]  well at the event, which is one hell of a thing if you know how events usually go.
[1852.48 --> 1856.72]  But the problem is networking backends.
[1856.88 --> 1861.82]  So, they have about 15% of the team working on Star Marine right now.
[1861.90 --> 1864.94]  It's been a pretty major focus because it's their next public release.
[1865.30 --> 1868.28]  But the networking backend is throwing a kind of wrench in things.
[1868.38 --> 1872.24]  So, there's no, like, release date now.
[1872.24 --> 1876.18]  Which kind of sucks, but I don't really care.
[1878.00 --> 1880.40]  When does networking not throw a wrench in things?
[1880.48 --> 1881.02]  That's true.
[1881.34 --> 1883.28]  But, like, I just, I just, yeah.
[1884.44 --> 1888.52]  Personally, I'm okay with my money being, like, reserved away for now.
[1888.90 --> 1890.44]  I just want them to finish the whole thing.
[1891.06 --> 1892.12]  And then I'll get really excited.
[1892.62 --> 1894.46]  In, like, three years.
[1895.54 --> 1896.22]  Four years?
[1896.86 --> 1897.70]  Yeah, and you know what?
[1897.78 --> 1900.14]  A game like that is going to be constantly evolving, too.
[1900.26 --> 1902.08]  So, you can probably kind of jump in at any time.
[1902.16 --> 1905.42]  And there's going to be, like, really cool new and interesting stuff to do.
[1905.68 --> 1905.92]  Yep.
[1906.98 --> 1908.78]  I wonder how the Vote for Turnip shirt is doing.
[1908.84 --> 1913.06]  This is one of those things where we just kind of, like, we kind of put it together because
[1913.06 --> 1916.04]  you guys were like, yeah, we want to vote for Turnip shirt.
[1916.04 --> 1920.94]  Apparently 16 people have Vote for Turnip swag on order already.
[1921.18 --> 1922.26]  I want to vote for Turnip shirt.
[1922.50 --> 1923.26]  I'm getting one.
[1923.32 --> 1924.22]  I always buy them, though.
[1924.22 --> 1928.72]  I mean, like, if I don't consider it good enough to buy...
[1928.72 --> 1929.96]  Then we probably shouldn't release the show.
[1929.98 --> 1932.68]  Yeah, should it be on the store?
[1932.82 --> 1934.02]  It's a pretty good metric, I guess.
[1935.12 --> 1936.60]  It's like, you know what?
[1936.62 --> 1937.78]  That one's kind of crap.
[1938.30 --> 1941.50]  It's okay for the plebs, you know, out there watching the show.
[1941.60 --> 1941.86]  But me?
[1942.02 --> 1942.38]  No, man.
[1942.38 --> 1946.92]  If you, like, run Ford but then refuse to drive a Ford, it's like, hmm.
[1948.68 --> 1949.72]  Maybe not good.
[1950.32 --> 1951.46]  Yes, exactly.
[1951.46 --> 1955.36]  Speaking about maybe not good, Warner Brothers...
[1955.36 --> 1956.74]  Oh, what do you mean maybe?
[1957.02 --> 1957.78]  What is maybe?
[1958.66 --> 1959.46]  Oh, hold on.
[1959.64 --> 1961.12]  Can I jump in really quickly here?
[1961.20 --> 1961.50]  No.
[1961.50 --> 1965.72]  On the subject of networking being a, like, gigantic load of poo.
[1965.72 --> 1976.94]  Um, if there is anyone who has actually managed to get SMB 3.0 multi-channel working.
[1977.30 --> 1983.70]  And I mean working, like, bonding together network interfaces, like, like, taking a quad-gigabit
[1983.70 --> 1990.14]  nick and a quad-gigabit nick and then a dumb switch and having that transfer at 4 gigabit
[1990.14 --> 1992.04]  speeds on a single file transfer.
[1992.44 --> 1993.88]  In theory, it does that.
[1994.36 --> 2000.18]  As far as I can tell, it is a gigantic load of bullshit because I have done everything.
[2000.18 --> 2003.08]  Fresh Windows 8.1 installs.
[2003.08 --> 2005.80]  Fresh Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2.
[2005.80 --> 2009.16]  Fresh 2 Server 2012 R2s.
[2009.16 --> 2012.56]  I have tried, uh, link aggregation, LACP.
[2012.56 --> 2015.46]  I have tried different modes of link aggregation.
[2015.46 --> 2019.24]  I have tried configuring the NIC teaming from within the Intel driver.
[2019.24 --> 2024.78]  I have tried configuring the NIC teaming from within Windows Server 2012 R2s control center
[2024.78 --> 2025.34]  panel.
[2025.70 --> 2027.54]  Enable this roll-in feature on the server.
[2027.66 --> 2029.50]  It doesn't work.
[2029.84 --> 2036.78]  I have found blog posts from people who say it works, but I have never actually seen it
[2036.78 --> 2036.96]  work.
[2037.06 --> 2038.92]  In theory, it just works.
[2039.14 --> 2040.24]  No configuration.
[2040.78 --> 2041.60]  No LACP.
[2041.82 --> 2042.60]  No smart switches.
[2043.02 --> 2043.66]  No nothing.
[2043.96 --> 2046.54]  In practice, it doesn't appear to do anything.
[2046.54 --> 2053.66]  I have even gotten as far as, through PowerShell, verifying that the SMB link is 3.02 between
[2053.66 --> 2055.52]  two Server 2012 R2 machines.
[2055.94 --> 2057.08]  Number of links open?
[2057.40 --> 2057.72]  One.
[2057.88 --> 2059.40]  Number of links that are always open?
[2059.66 --> 2060.10]  One!
[2061.04 --> 2064.64]  It's supposed to have multiple links, so if anyone's ever actually gotten it working and
[2064.64 --> 2067.14]  has some pro tips, I'm more than happy to hear about them.
[2067.44 --> 2069.28]  Post on the forum would be the best way to do that.
[2069.36 --> 2069.90]  It's down!
[2070.60 --> 2071.20]  It's down?
[2071.34 --> 2071.90]  It's down.
[2072.12 --> 2073.34]  Forum's down, I know!
[2073.68 --> 2074.16]  Do it later.
[2075.24 --> 2075.64]  Okay.
[2076.54 --> 2078.66]  So let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.
[2078.96 --> 2079.14]  Right.
[2079.34 --> 2082.30]  Warner Brothers knew that Arkham Knight PC was a mess months ago.
[2082.38 --> 2083.40]  I'm going to pull up the article here.
[2083.42 --> 2083.90]  Well, in the archive, it's not down.
[2084.94 --> 2085.22]  Yes.
[2086.14 --> 2086.38]  Yeah.
[2086.96 --> 2087.92]  So, never mind.
[2087.96 --> 2088.50]  So there's that.
[2088.82 --> 2093.68]  So for the other, like, you know, 150,000 people that are going to watch, you'll be fine.
[2093.80 --> 2094.18]  Yay!
[2094.30 --> 2096.02]  You guys are MVPs too, man.
[2096.06 --> 2096.88]  That's what I said.
[2097.04 --> 2098.46]  So Warner butts.
[2100.22 --> 2100.86]  Heyo!
[2101.56 --> 2102.04]  Yeah!
[2102.04 --> 2102.52]  Yeah!
[2103.10 --> 2107.00]  I remember when you used to high-five me and touch me without wiping your hands first.
[2107.80 --> 2108.54]  You learned.
[2109.68 --> 2111.88]  I always used to, like...
[2111.88 --> 2114.16]  But you used to be a lot sweatier.
[2114.60 --> 2114.86]  Yeah.
[2114.86 --> 2116.86]  Okay.
[2120.94 --> 2121.34]  Okay.
[2121.50 --> 2121.98]  I'm sorry.
[2122.04 --> 2122.50]  I'm sorry.
[2122.60 --> 2123.46]  Do your topic.
[2124.04 --> 2124.48]  Anyways.
[2125.42 --> 2126.58]  Warner Brothers someone.
[2126.88 --> 2128.96]  There's a quote here, but it doesn't say from who.
[2129.12 --> 2130.24]  Those are the best quotes.
[2130.60 --> 2130.94]  It says,
[2131.10 --> 2137.42]  I will say it's pretty rich for Warner Brothers to act like they had no idea the game was in such a horrible state.
[2137.64 --> 2137.86]  Oh!
[2138.10 --> 2139.76]  Said one quality assurance tester.
[2139.76 --> 2140.78]  We don't know who exactly.
[2140.78 --> 2144.28]  That sounds like a super reliable quote.
[2144.32 --> 2145.98]  Who worked on the game for years, apparently.
[2146.12 --> 2151.50]  It's been like this for months, and all the problems we see now were the exact same.
[2152.18 --> 2153.62]  Unchanged almost a year ago.
[2157.74 --> 2158.54]  I guess...
[2158.54 --> 2159.52]  Do we even need to say anything else?
[2159.60 --> 2160.30]  No, yeah, we do.
[2160.42 --> 2160.72]  Because...
[2160.72 --> 2160.90]  Okay.
[2161.30 --> 2163.54]  Because this isn't news.
[2163.98 --> 2165.10]  No, that's my point, yeah.
[2167.20 --> 2167.56]  Obviously.
[2167.56 --> 2173.82]  I mean, you know, the funny thing is, is the online, you know, the bloggers, and even guys like us will go,
[2174.24 --> 2179.24]  how could their quality control, blah, blah, it has nothing to do with quality control.
[2179.36 --> 2180.02]  It's not the devs.
[2180.06 --> 2181.14]  We've talked about that a lot before.
[2181.26 --> 2183.60]  Like, the Ubisoft devs, probably great.
[2184.74 --> 2187.16]  Not their call to do a lot of the stuff that happens.
[2187.16 --> 2190.08]  So, yeah.
[2190.28 --> 2191.54]  I mean, you...
[2191.54 --> 2192.98]  I mean, unless you're, like...
[2192.98 --> 2198.60]  Unless you're, like, sneaking into the office to, like, fix bugs on your own time,
[2198.82 --> 2202.06]  you have to do what the person writing your paycheck tells you to do.
[2202.12 --> 2205.42]  And honestly, knowing some people in the gaming industry, they do that.
[2205.96 --> 2209.18]  They don't sneak in, but, like, they fix stuff on their own time.
[2209.54 --> 2210.78]  A lot of the guys do.
[2211.18 --> 2212.20]  And it's still not enough.
[2212.20 --> 2217.88]  So, I mean, do we need, like, a summary of, like, how utterly broken it is?
[2218.00 --> 2218.82]  The good news is that...
[2218.82 --> 2219.96]  I think everybody knows at this point.
[2220.00 --> 2223.50]  The good news is that Warner Brothers is paying for their sins.
[2223.72 --> 2224.92]  They are...
[2224.92 --> 2226.02]  Because they got wrecked.
[2226.56 --> 2226.98]  They...
[2226.98 --> 2231.94]  It is costing them the Steam fee every time you refund it, which is great.
[2232.76 --> 2233.98]  Steam's refund statement is,
[2234.06 --> 2239.02]  we want to apologize to those of you who are experiencing performance issues with Batman Arkham Knight on PC.
[2239.20 --> 2241.74]  We take these issues very seriously and have therefore decided to suspend.
[2242.20 --> 2243.80]  Future game sales of the PC version.
[2243.90 --> 2245.04]  Of course, we talked about that before.
[2245.86 --> 2250.28]  It is unclear, in spite of the minor patch that addressed some crashing bugs,
[2250.38 --> 2252.20]  introduced rain effects, and fixed a few other issues,
[2252.38 --> 2255.54]  it is unclear when it will go on sale again.
[2255.96 --> 2257.32]  Here's something I want to know.
[2257.80 --> 2259.20]  After Batman Arkham...
[2259.88 --> 2260.22]  Hold on.
[2260.28 --> 2261.20]  Is it Arkham Asylum...
[2262.02 --> 2263.04]  Arkham City...
[2263.04 --> 2264.52]  Arkham Origins...
[2264.52 --> 2266.50]  After Origins...
[2266.50 --> 2268.42]  Why was anyone even buying this game?
[2269.68 --> 2270.84]  Especially pre-ordering it.
[2270.88 --> 2271.30]  Like, really?
[2272.30 --> 2273.12]  I didn't even...
[2273.12 --> 2275.94]  I think I got, like, 25% of the way through Origins,
[2276.00 --> 2276.50]  and I was just like,
[2276.78 --> 2278.34]  who the hell are all these people?
[2278.52 --> 2278.78]  Yeah.
[2280.02 --> 2280.34]  Yeah.
[2280.80 --> 2282.32]  Like, really?
[2282.46 --> 2284.72]  Like, the big twist at the end is that it's...
[2284.72 --> 2285.40]  The Joker?
[2286.40 --> 2289.00]  I mean, I would say spoiler alert, but...
[2289.00 --> 2290.72]  How is that a spoiler?
[2291.66 --> 2293.44]  It's, like, the most obvious thing ever.
[2293.52 --> 2295.70]  It's, like, a bunch of no-name nonsense.
[2295.70 --> 2297.08]  It's, like...
[2297.08 --> 2297.68]  Stupid.
[2298.46 --> 2299.14]  It was stupid.
[2299.34 --> 2301.18]  I enjoyed Arkham Asylum a lot.
[2301.38 --> 2301.60]  You did.
[2301.70 --> 2303.18]  I loved Arkham Asylum.
[2303.50 --> 2304.94]  I even enjoyed Arkham City.
[2305.06 --> 2305.70]  I think because...
[2306.36 --> 2310.42]  Partly because I left a lot of time in between playing Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.
[2311.12 --> 2312.60]  So it felt more new, I guess?
[2312.72 --> 2314.10]  Yeah, I didn't play it right at release.
[2314.10 --> 2318.20]  So I had kind of forgotten that Arkham Asylum was the same damn game.
[2318.32 --> 2318.50]  Yeah.
[2318.68 --> 2322.24]  But then I played Arkham Origins right away afterward.
[2322.82 --> 2325.02]  Because I was like, right, I bought Arkham Origins.
[2325.18 --> 2327.40]  And then I was like, oh, I should really play Arkham City.
[2327.66 --> 2331.14]  And then I played those two back-to-back, at least the part of Origins that I played.
[2331.22 --> 2332.40]  And I was just like...
[2332.40 --> 2333.96]  Do I...
[2333.96 --> 2334.58]  You know what?
[2334.78 --> 2336.32]  Maybe I should just replay Asylum.
[2340.40 --> 2341.36]  Because you know what?
[2341.36 --> 2344.52]  That linear corridor-style gameplay works really well for Batman.
[2344.66 --> 2345.06]  And you know what?
[2345.22 --> 2348.30]  I've legitimately thought about just replaying Assassin's Creed 2 before.
[2349.36 --> 2351.46]  When Unity came out, I was like, this is such trash.
[2351.50 --> 2352.92]  And I was like, I need an Assassin's Creed fix.
[2352.96 --> 2356.58]  And I was like, I could just install 2 and Brotherhoods and Ascension.
[2356.94 --> 2362.12]  Okay, at risk of going on another tirade about how rubbish Final Fantasy 7 is compared to 6,
[2362.58 --> 2364.42]  I have actually done this.
[2365.04 --> 2368.78]  When I forget which Final Fantasy it was, but it was really stupid.
[2368.78 --> 2372.66]  And basically, I put it down after like a few hours.
[2373.02 --> 2374.44]  Fortunately, I borrowed it from someone.
[2374.56 --> 2375.34]  I did not buy it.
[2376.36 --> 2378.86]  And I replayed the entirety of Final Fantasy 6.
[2379.46 --> 2380.66]  Because I was just like, nope!
[2381.12 --> 2381.44]  Nope!
[2382.58 --> 2383.54]  I am going to...
[2383.54 --> 2386.18]  Damn it, I am going to have a good Final Fantasy experience today!
[2387.68 --> 2389.16]  And not everyone's sitting, obviously.
[2389.24 --> 2390.48]  It's a pretty long game, but...
[2390.48 --> 2391.00]  That's awesome.
[2391.00 --> 2397.18]  I finished the Starcraft 2 campaign and was like, really, really frustrated with the end.
[2397.28 --> 2398.08]  This was Wings of Liberty.
[2398.52 --> 2398.78]  Yeah, okay.
[2398.94 --> 2400.12]  It's a good enough campaign.
[2400.24 --> 2402.58]  You like RTS campaigns too, so you get it.
[2402.68 --> 2403.82]  It's a good enough campaign.
[2404.28 --> 2408.22]  And then the very last cinematic, I was very frustrated with.
[2408.50 --> 2409.36]  So I was like, screw this!
[2409.40 --> 2411.10]  Went back and played the Warcraft 3 campaign.
[2411.46 --> 2413.56]  The Warcraft 3 campaign is great!
[2413.58 --> 2414.38]  I love it!
[2414.48 --> 2415.56]  It is so great!
[2415.58 --> 2416.64]  It's really good, yeah.
[2416.64 --> 2420.22]  Like, oh, Ben, yeah, it's really good.
[2420.30 --> 2421.24]  Like, you actually...
[2421.24 --> 2428.34]  I'm more invested in the characters of Warcraft 3 in some cases than I am in some TV shows and movies.
[2428.76 --> 2435.92]  Like, you know, watching him turn from, like, you know, the paladin into the lich knight or whatever nonsense.
[2436.36 --> 2438.58]  I don't even remember the character classes or whatever.
[2438.82 --> 2439.60]  Rexxar's badass.
[2439.62 --> 2440.36]  All that stuff.
[2440.56 --> 2442.32]  And, like, whatever they all...
[2442.32 --> 2446.44]  It's been a long time since I played it, but that Elder Taren guy...
[2446.44 --> 2447.66]  Yeah, uh...
[2447.66 --> 2448.08]  Crap.
[2448.24 --> 2448.48]  Bloodhoof?
[2448.48 --> 2448.84]  What's his name?
[2449.44 --> 2449.76]  Is it?
[2449.76 --> 2450.32]  Is it Bloodhoof?
[2450.32 --> 2450.96]  Connor Bloodhoof?
[2451.10 --> 2452.66]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2453.20 --> 2453.92]  He's awesome.
[2454.36 --> 2455.22]  I love all those guys.
[2455.56 --> 2455.72]  Yeah.
[2455.72 --> 2456.86]  Those are just so good at that.
[2457.00 --> 2457.94]  I'm actually...
[2457.94 --> 2459.14]  Have we heard anything about...
[2459.14 --> 2462.44]  What's that team-based FPS that they've got going on?
[2462.50 --> 2463.92]  Something lock or something...
[2463.92 --> 2464.22]  Over...
[2464.22 --> 2464.54]  Overlook.
[2465.18 --> 2465.46]  Overwatch.
[2465.78 --> 2466.52]  Overwatch, yeah.
[2466.66 --> 2468.16]  Has there been any news on that lately?
[2468.42 --> 2469.26]  I think so, yeah.
[2469.52 --> 2470.34]  Nothing major.
[2470.34 --> 2473.02]  I think it's just been like, oh, here's a new character.
[2473.02 --> 2476.82]  Or here's some footage of people fighting on a map or something.
[2476.88 --> 2478.24]  I don't think there's been anything huge.
[2478.36 --> 2479.56]  Oh, beta confirmed for this fall.
[2479.72 --> 2480.02]  Okay, so...
[2480.02 --> 2480.22]  Cool.
[2480.66 --> 2482.48]  Yeah, I'm gonna play it, because, like...
[2482.48 --> 2482.90]  Me too.
[2483.14 --> 2483.18]  For sure.
[2483.18 --> 2486.06]  I take a lot of flack for not being a real gamer from people.
[2487.12 --> 2489.64]  I actually played, like, shed loads of TF2.
[2490.00 --> 2491.92]  Like, hundreds of hours of Team Fortress 2.
[2492.32 --> 2493.66]  That's why I'm interested in this.
[2494.00 --> 2494.40]  And...
[2494.40 --> 2494.84]  And...
[2494.84 --> 2497.30]  But I'm done with Team Fortress 2, because it's free-to-play.
[2497.40 --> 2498.50]  Oh, is Overwatch free-to-play?
[2499.46 --> 2499.86]  Probably.
[2499.86 --> 2500.70]  Oh, okay.
[2500.82 --> 2501.24]  Well, whatever.
[2501.86 --> 2503.00]  Anyway, you know...
[2503.00 --> 2504.06]  That seems to be Blizzard's direction.
[2504.14 --> 2507.86]  This is gonna be, like, me being, like, a snobby elitist.
[2507.94 --> 2511.14]  Well, you know, I paid for the orange box, so...
[2511.14 --> 2511.60]  I did too.
[2511.76 --> 2513.86]  All these, like, trash free-to-play players.
[2514.02 --> 2515.72]  It's not about that.
[2515.84 --> 2522.60]  It's about that it really did change the dynamic when Valve got focused on selling hats,
[2522.98 --> 2526.38]  as opposed to selling copies of a game for $59.99.
[2526.92 --> 2529.40]  It really does change the game in a big way.
[2529.40 --> 2535.12]  And there's reasons that some Valve games, even ones that have free-to-play aspects,
[2535.32 --> 2540.52]  like, say, for example, oh, I don't know, gun skins or knife skins, like CSGO, remain paid titles.
[2541.14 --> 2547.52]  Having that pay barrier in place actually does keep out some of the riffraff.
[2547.56 --> 2549.94]  And I don't mean riffraff like people who can't afford the game.
[2550.16 --> 2550.64]  Or the rapper.
[2550.64 --> 2560.88]  I mean riffraff like people who are buying multiple copies of the game in order to dink with it or hack or just basically, like, not care.
[2560.94 --> 2561.66]  Be a trolley jerk.
[2561.86 --> 2569.16]  Investing in being part of a community ultimately does tend to result in a more invested community member.
[2569.16 --> 2573.88]  That's, yeah, I generally prefer paid games, especially paid MMOs.
[2574.08 --> 2575.68]  Free-to-play MMOs are just garbage.
[2577.44 --> 2577.88]  Garbage.
[2578.00 --> 2578.62]  In my opinion.
[2579.18 --> 2580.28]  Yes, this is all I am...
[2580.84 --> 2582.42]  I-O-H-O.
[2582.60 --> 2584.00]  I-O-R-H-O.
[2584.04 --> 2584.78]  I-O-H-O.
[2584.86 --> 2585.56]  In our opinion.
[2585.72 --> 2586.56]  Yeah, in our opinion.
[2587.42 --> 2589.52]  We're basically one person as far as we can tell.
[2589.52 --> 2592.64]  I split off at some point.
[2592.72 --> 2594.04]  That's why he's much larger than me.
[2594.20 --> 2594.42]  Yeah.
[2594.78 --> 2596.06]  Except I'm older than you.
[2596.12 --> 2596.86]  How does that work?
[2596.94 --> 2597.58]  You must have still been like...
[2597.58 --> 2599.68]  Maybe I split off and I took too much matter.
[2599.68 --> 2602.86]  No, you were in an embryonic stage at the beginning or something.
[2602.92 --> 2603.42]  Because you're...
[2603.42 --> 2605.80]  Because, like, your age doesn't start until you're born.
[2605.90 --> 2607.10]  So maybe it was pre-birth.
[2607.26 --> 2607.66]  Mmm.
[2608.34 --> 2611.16]  But if we share a mother, then why is our hair color different?
[2612.02 --> 2612.86]  It's not much different.
[2612.94 --> 2613.38]  It shouldn't...
[2613.38 --> 2614.14]  Yeah, it's pretty different.
[2614.18 --> 2614.88]  You're pretty blonde.
[2614.98 --> 2618.12]  You've got kind of that platinum nonsense that chicks dig going on.
[2618.12 --> 2619.76]  Mine bleaches in the summer, though.
[2620.38 --> 2621.18]  Yeah, mine too.
[2621.26 --> 2621.86]  But not...
[2621.86 --> 2623.06]  Clearly not either that or I haven't gotten much.
[2623.06 --> 2623.90]  But do you have gel in?
[2624.02 --> 2624.52]  I do.
[2624.58 --> 2625.02]  I don't.
[2625.40 --> 2625.92]  You don't?
[2626.38 --> 2626.74]  Okay.
[2627.52 --> 2628.42]  That could be arranged.
[2631.30 --> 2632.64]  Something about Mary Reference!
[2632.76 --> 2633.04]  Yes!
[2635.38 --> 2636.14]  Great work.
[2636.68 --> 2638.24]  Okay, so...
[2638.24 --> 2642.36]  R9 Fury X sound issues.
[2642.58 --> 2645.60]  Some people have reported whiny pumps.
[2645.60 --> 2652.58]  And PC Per went as far as to acquire, I think two, retail R9 Fury X's.
[2652.98 --> 2656.12]  This was posted on the forum by Big Strooms.
[2656.78 --> 2657.34]  Strooms.
[2657.34 --> 2659.54]  And it has basically been determined...
[2659.54 --> 2660.30]  No, I did not.
[2660.30 --> 2660.58]  I can't.
[2660.64 --> 2661.06]  Thank you.
[2661.30 --> 2669.10]  It has basically been determined that while AMD did tell some reviewers, not us, that the
[2669.10 --> 2672.72]  pump whining issue that some reviewers were encountering, like kind of a high-pitched
[2672.72 --> 2674.64]  whine that you get with some cheaper pumps...
[2674.64 --> 2676.60]  We had our power supply whine, but not our pump.
[2676.70 --> 2677.52]  Yeah, and you know what?
[2677.56 --> 2680.26]  The other power supplies that I've tried it on since didn't whine.
[2680.90 --> 2681.68]  So that was interesting.
[2682.20 --> 2683.64]  So our pump didn't whine.
[2683.72 --> 2685.42]  So we never really asked about it.
[2685.46 --> 2689.02]  But they were told, oh, it's fixed and the retail units will be fixed.
[2689.02 --> 2695.60]  But PC Per actually got retail units that were whiny.
[2696.08 --> 2706.72]  But some enterprising online community members have gone ahead and started taking the front
[2706.72 --> 2711.44]  plates off of their Fury X's to reveal that there are indeed two pump revisions.
[2711.44 --> 2715.92]  One with a shiny Cooler Master logo and one with a colorful Cooler Master logo.
[2716.04 --> 2718.50]  The shiny one is the new one.
[2719.42 --> 2720.46]  So if you have the shiny...
[2720.46 --> 2724.72]  You can actually check if you have the whiny pump version or the non-whiny pump version
[2724.72 --> 2727.36]  by checking under that shroud that can be removed.
[2727.36 --> 2727.62]  That's brutal.
[2727.62 --> 2731.66]  And this is something cool we didn't mention in our Fury X video because I completely missed
[2731.66 --> 2731.94]  it.
[2732.66 --> 2735.02]  And I guess you did too since you hosted that video.
[2735.20 --> 2741.50]  But AMD is apparently providing the models for that front plate so you can 3D print your
[2741.50 --> 2743.18]  own customized ones.
[2743.58 --> 2745.94]  I don't think they told us.
[2745.96 --> 2746.92]  Yeah, that's pretty cool, hey?
[2747.12 --> 2747.42]  Yeah.
[2747.64 --> 2747.90]  Yeah.
[2747.98 --> 2749.28]  I would have liked to have called that out.
[2749.48 --> 2749.74]  Yeah.
[2749.96 --> 2753.28]  Because, I mean, embracing the modding community is like thumbs up from us.
[2753.32 --> 2754.06]  We love that stuff.
[2754.14 --> 2754.34]  Yeah.
[2754.34 --> 2754.42]  Yeah.
[2755.92 --> 2757.14]  So anyway, yeah.
[2757.24 --> 2760.34]  The pump whine, to be clear, has nothing to do with whether the card is...
[2760.96 --> 2761.50]  Hey, hey!
[2761.66 --> 2762.42]  Ed's doing the garbage.
[2762.52 --> 2764.44]  Don't forget to remind next week's person.
[2764.96 --> 2765.44]  Who's that?
[2765.56 --> 2765.74]  Luke?
[2765.84 --> 2766.66]  I think it's Brandon.
[2766.88 --> 2767.06]  Brandon.
[2767.30 --> 2767.62]  Yeah.
[2767.74 --> 2769.14]  It's an order of higher date, mostly.
[2769.64 --> 2771.56]  Except you're first, for some reason.
[2771.68 --> 2773.06]  Because I didn't want to make you first.
[2773.36 --> 2774.16]  Because I didn't want to, like...
[2774.16 --> 2776.98]  Because I made the schedule, so I didn't want to be like, ah, you have to do it today.
[2777.14 --> 2778.42]  So I moved to that.
[2778.52 --> 2779.46]  And then everything else is.
[2779.46 --> 2782.04]  There are so many things that I do just in order of seniority.
[2782.04 --> 2784.94]  More so that I just don't forget people than anything else.
[2785.24 --> 2786.38]  Did you ever clean the bathroom?
[2786.86 --> 2787.66]  I didn't.
[2788.00 --> 2788.40]  You didn't?
[2789.10 --> 2789.48]  Why?
[2789.90 --> 2790.84]  No, I'm just wondering.
[2790.86 --> 2791.52]  I will.
[2791.92 --> 2793.34]  Well, look at it this way.
[2793.94 --> 2796.94]  Realistically, when we move out, who's going to be the one stuck cleaning the bathroom?
[2797.80 --> 2799.50]  So at some point, I will clean it.
[2801.14 --> 2806.70]  Maybe he might be asking, because there's technically no punishment if I don't clean the bathroom for someone to miss.
[2806.70 --> 2807.80]  I thought about it.
[2809.26 --> 2809.64]  Wow.
[2809.64 --> 2811.26]  And then I took the garbage out anyways.
[2811.72 --> 2816.76]  So anyway, the whining is, regardless of whether the card is under load or not under load,
[2817.00 --> 2821.44]  and it's actually something that, even when I started hearing about it, I didn't really think anything of.
[2821.50 --> 2827.06]  Because most cheap pumps, and when I say cheap, I don't mean like, ha ha, it's cheap, it will fail tomorrow.
[2827.06 --> 2832.24]  I mean like, when you're building a custom water cooling loop, you're spending $100 on your pump.
[2832.92 --> 2840.34]  An all-in-one water cooler with a block, a radiator, a pump, tubing, and like, mounting hardware and a fan is like, less than $100.
[2840.72 --> 2842.00]  So let's just put it in perspective.
[2842.54 --> 2848.78]  A cheap pump is going to tend to have some noise, whatever the silence enthusiasts out there might think about it.
[2848.78 --> 2853.94]  So I didn't really think anything of it, but some people have been saying that apparently it's quite obnoxious,
[2854.26 --> 2859.44]  whereas our Fury X, I could barely even notice it over like an air CPU cooler, for example.
[2859.76 --> 2861.82]  And like, I'm pretty picky, you know this.
[2862.32 --> 2866.58]  Any of you who have ever seen my rig in person and been like, what?
[2867.96 --> 2871.64]  We'll probably know this, so there you go.
[2874.68 --> 2877.88]  Someone in chat just asked if we can see the chat, no we cannot.
[2877.88 --> 2878.82]  Nope.
[2880.02 --> 2881.34]  I can look at it now.
[2881.74 --> 2884.14]  It's a bunch of stuff about fire poles, why am I even looking at this?
[2884.86 --> 2886.44]  Nope, nope, you're fired.
[2888.02 --> 2888.38]  Pole.
[2888.90 --> 2889.12]  Duh.
[2889.28 --> 2890.94]  Oh, snap.
[2891.60 --> 2894.24]  Being fire-pulled would actually really hurt a lot.
[2895.32 --> 2895.88]  Fire-pulled.
[2895.94 --> 2896.92]  It's a large amount of metal.
[2897.28 --> 2898.48]  Like, impaled?
[2898.90 --> 2899.06]  Oh.
[2899.50 --> 2900.50]  Or impaled you with it.
[2900.50 --> 2903.08]  Impaled would hurt sort of regardless of what it was with.
[2903.24 --> 2903.42]  Yep.
[2903.72 --> 2905.72]  I mean, unless it was not too long.
[2905.72 --> 2908.08]  Wow.
[2908.98 --> 2910.46]  Well, if it's a fire pole, it's pretty scary.
[2910.46 --> 2917.08]  Did you know that impalement is actually, like, the death process is from your own body weight?
[2920.42 --> 2920.82]  No.
[2921.08 --> 2921.34]  Yeah.
[2921.34 --> 2923.66]  Yeah, it's actually, like, much worse.
[2923.72 --> 2927.56]  Like, impale can be used simply to describe, like, stabbing, like, skewering.
[2928.00 --> 2930.00]  But impalement, like, the execution.
[2930.20 --> 2931.16]  Is when you're, like, dropped on it?
[2931.20 --> 2932.58]  Is when, no, you're not dropped.
[2932.70 --> 2933.78]  You're more placed.
[2933.88 --> 2934.34]  Oh, right.
[2934.38 --> 2935.40]  And then you, like, yeah.
[2935.50 --> 2937.14]  And then you slide.
[2937.48 --> 2939.70]  So the more you squirm, the faster you die kind of thing.
[2939.70 --> 2941.74]  So that's sort of a gross fact.
[2941.88 --> 2942.72]  That's unfortunate.
[2943.86 --> 2944.58]  Maybe a factoid.
[2944.70 --> 2946.86]  Did you know that a factoid is an untrue fact?
[2947.34 --> 2947.86]  Really?
[2948.08 --> 2948.32]  Yeah.
[2948.78 --> 2949.16]  What?
[2950.20 --> 2953.84]  This one I'll, this one I'll prove because most people don't know that.
[2954.62 --> 2955.88]  Factoid definition.
[2956.96 --> 2957.52]  A factoid.
[2957.68 --> 2962.04]  A brief or trivial item of news or information, an assumption or speculation that is reported
[2962.04 --> 2964.18]  or repeated so often that becomes accepted as fact.
[2965.20 --> 2965.72]  Wow.
[2965.94 --> 2966.68]  Interesting, hey?
[2967.48 --> 2969.32]  That becomes accepted as fact.
[2969.32 --> 2969.44]  Fact.
[2970.52 --> 2970.96]  Yikes.
[2973.74 --> 2974.18]  Yeah.
[2975.18 --> 2979.98]  Kind of like that, did you know 90% of all statistics are made up on the spot or whatever it's
[2979.98 --> 2980.14]  thing.
[2980.18 --> 2981.54]  You know what my favorite Twitter account is?
[2981.84 --> 2982.46]  Which one?
[2982.58 --> 2983.38]  Stats Canada.
[2983.84 --> 2984.60]  Stats Canada?
[2984.74 --> 2986.52]  It's a fake account and it's hilarious.
[2987.38 --> 2991.50]  They just released random fake statistics about Canada and it's so funny.
[2992.02 --> 2994.48]  While you look up a real thing, I'm going to look up that.
[2994.48 --> 2997.26]  Speaking of which, we have a new real Canadian.
[2997.26 --> 2997.36]  Canadian.
[2997.86 --> 2998.18]  Yeah.
[2998.18 --> 3004.72]  So our hire from the US is like getting his car registration changed over today.
[3004.88 --> 3006.24]  He's got his work permit.
[3006.68 --> 3008.22]  I think he's planning to start next week.
[3008.22 --> 3011.14]  But he's not technically a Canadian yet.
[3011.32 --> 3012.68]  No, I don't think he has citizenship.
[3012.88 --> 3013.72]  He has a work permit.
[3014.00 --> 3014.10]  Yeah.
[3014.10 --> 3017.78]  But then once you're working in Canada for a long time, the process of applying for citizenship
[3017.78 --> 3018.70]  becomes much easier.
[3018.76 --> 3019.58]  It becomes pretty straightforward.
[3019.74 --> 3019.88]  Yeah.
[3019.88 --> 3024.40]  Speaking of waiting lists, this was posted by Joss on the forum.
[3024.90 --> 3028.30]  There is now a waiting list for IPv4 addresses.
[3028.86 --> 3030.64]  The end is nigh.
[3030.74 --> 3037.56]  We actually did a Fastest Possible episode on IPv4 versus IPv6 and how IPv6 is basically
[3037.56 --> 3041.90]  going to be enough for everyone and their dog to have hundreds of thousands of IP addresses.
[3041.90 --> 3048.28]  Whereas IPv4 with the internet of things and with all the houses being connected and businesses
[3048.28 --> 3052.06]  needing all these IP addresses and websites and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3052.92 --> 3056.64]  IPv4, we are like straight up out of addresses.
[3056.96 --> 3061.90]  There are apparently only about 150,000 IPv4 addresses left in the pool at ARIN.
[3062.10 --> 3064.12]  One of five pools left worldwide.
[3064.34 --> 3066.62]  So ARIN is the American registry for internet numbers.
[3066.62 --> 3070.68]  So they actually had to tell an applicant for a new internet address to wait.
[3072.22 --> 3073.14]  Holy balls.
[3073.26 --> 3076.12]  Now, to be clear, they are reused constantly.
[3076.30 --> 3079.48]  So it's not like you churn and burn through them or anything.
[3079.82 --> 3085.80]  Like, you know, when your IP address changes from your ISP, like your external IP address,
[3085.86 --> 3090.32]  you can have not as many as you want on your local network, but sort of as many as you want
[3090.32 --> 3092.18]  if you're a network admin and you're super smart about it.
[3092.18 --> 3096.64]  Um, like, okay, the point is...
[3096.64 --> 3098.16]  You're going down a weird tunnel here, sir.
[3098.20 --> 3099.30]  Yeah, don't worry about that.
[3099.30 --> 3099.58]  Get it, tunnel?
[3100.64 --> 3101.32]  Ah ha ha!
[3102.28 --> 3102.76]  Yes!
[3103.52 --> 3112.64]  You can assign 192.168.0 point whatever's to your heart's content behind your outward-facing IP address,
[3112.72 --> 3116.72]  but that one can be reassigned and recycled by your internet service provider.
[3116.82 --> 3121.52]  So when you're done with it, they might pass it along to Jeff down the street or whatever the case may be.
[3121.52 --> 3122.36]  Aw, Jeff.
[3122.76 --> 3124.92]  So, um, blah, blah, blah.
[3125.20 --> 3126.92]  So, ba-do-ba-do-ba-do.
[3127.08 --> 3127.32]  Yeah.
[3127.54 --> 3132.36]  So some of the ones that have been assigned may get returned if an address holder goes out of business
[3132.36 --> 3133.60]  or fails to pay its dues.
[3133.88 --> 3137.90]  And there will be a few more distributions from a global pool run by ICANN,
[3137.98 --> 3141.12]  but for now, getting waitlisted is mostly a problem for bigger entities,
[3141.28 --> 3143.56]  but it is definitely a thing.
[3144.84 --> 3145.28]  Interesting.
[3145.28 --> 3145.92]  Router.
[3145.92 --> 3154.40]  So IPv6, which has some very unfortunate compatibility implications for older network hardware,
[3154.60 --> 3156.16]  and there's going to be some hardware upgrades.
[3156.64 --> 3161.72]  There will be, but they've been rolling out IPv6 stuff for a really long time.
[3161.72 --> 3162.12]  They have?
[3162.12 --> 3165.10]  Of course, it will be an absolute crap storm.
[3165.36 --> 3165.64]  Yes.
[3165.66 --> 3168.30]  But they've been working on this for a really long time.
[3168.36 --> 3172.48]  Like, it's been in progress, and like, I mean, okay, it's like the, uh,
[3172.48 --> 3176.24]  we just shot as fast as possible about, um, Wi-Fi security.
[3176.24 --> 3184.26]  And like, the number of articles while I was researching and the amount of facts that there is
[3184.26 --> 3193.78]  behind people still using WP and WPA encrypted passwords on their Wi-Fi access points is obscene.
[3194.02 --> 3199.38]  Especially when you consider that it has been, by law, you've had to have WPA2 support on anything
[3199.38 --> 3201.76]  with a Wi-Fi sticker on it since 2006!
[3202.44 --> 3203.80]  For like nine years!
[3203.90 --> 3207.14]  I mean, who is actually using a computer from nine years ago?
[3207.24 --> 3209.20]  When did WRT54Gs come out?
[3210.20 --> 3211.42]  Oh, wow, I don't know.
[3211.56 --> 3213.72]  I'm pretty sure it supports WPA2.
[3216.96 --> 3218.60]  Of course, there's a Wikipedia article.
[3218.60 --> 3219.98]  Look up the GL.
[3219.98 --> 3220.68]  This specific rotor.
[3220.68 --> 3223.32]  The GL is the, kind of, the important one.
[3223.86 --> 3224.48]  Here, this guy.
[3224.66 --> 3225.24]  1.3.
[3225.54 --> 3225.70]  Yeah.
[3227.28 --> 3227.84]  Um...
[3227.84 --> 3228.88]  It doesn't have a date.
[3228.88 --> 3229.72]  Wow.
[3230.52 --> 3231.92]  Thanks for that, Wikipedia!
[3232.28 --> 3233.44]  Wow, you're useless!
[3233.52 --> 3234.94]  Yeah, uselesspedia!
[3235.24 --> 3235.72]  Horrible!
[3236.08 --> 3240.06]  I'm gonna ignore your donation request even harder next time!
[3240.40 --> 3241.16]  More than 20...
[3241.16 --> 3242.40]  I actually donated last time.
[3242.44 --> 3243.56]  To be clear, I love Wikipedia.
[3243.80 --> 3244.66]  I think what they do is incredibly valuable.
[3244.66 --> 3247.70]  December of 2002 was the WRT54G.
[3247.70 --> 3249.42]  Well, there you go, so...
[3249.42 --> 3250.78]  It's probably a whole bunch of those.
[3252.24 --> 3252.72]  Great.
[3253.20 --> 3254.70]  To be completely honest.
[3254.92 --> 3256.42]  I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[3257.36 --> 3258.54]  Oh, my goodness!
[3258.88 --> 3263.44]  Speaking of things to not be surprised about, The WAN Show has sponsors!
[3264.44 --> 3264.78]  Yeah!
[3265.50 --> 3268.84]  So our sponsors today are Lynda.com.
[3269.30 --> 3270.36]  Control-F, Lynda.
[3270.42 --> 3272.78]  What is going on with the freaking dock here?
[3274.84 --> 3275.36]  It...
[3275.36 --> 3277.30]  What the heck?
[3278.06 --> 3278.54]  Are you...
[3278.54 --> 3280.12]  Look, the whole thing's shifted over.
[3280.24 --> 3280.62]  I know!
[3280.62 --> 3281.62]  There's no scroll bar.
[3281.64 --> 3284.02]  I don't understand the things that I'm seeing.
[3284.44 --> 3285.90]  I'm going to open a new tab.
[3285.90 --> 3286.90]  I've never seen that before.
[3287.02 --> 3288.66]  Linus' solution to everything.
[3288.82 --> 3289.94]  Open a new tab.
[3291.82 --> 3295.16]  That, my friends, is why I have so many browser tabs.
[3295.40 --> 3295.74]  God.
[3296.10 --> 3296.60]  It's like...
[3296.60 --> 3296.94]  Quick!
[3297.30 --> 3298.14]  Scroll wheel click!
[3298.40 --> 3299.24]  Scroll wheel click!
[3299.32 --> 3299.76]  Damn it!
[3300.72 --> 3300.94]  Okay.
[3301.54 --> 3302.58]  So, Lynda.com.
[3302.66 --> 3304.18]  Used by millions of people worldwide.
[3304.32 --> 3304.48]  Okay.
[3304.56 --> 3308.72]  Now, I told you that you were going to have to have your mom's site on Lynda.com by the
[3308.72 --> 3309.54]  time we did our next spot.
[3309.60 --> 3311.26]  But I wasn't expecting it to be the following week.
[3311.70 --> 3312.54]  Did I say Lynda...
[3312.54 --> 3312.86]  Right.
[3312.98 --> 3313.68]  That makes no sense.
[3313.68 --> 3316.10]  Lynda.com can teach you to make a website.
[3316.26 --> 3316.74]  That's true.
[3316.80 --> 3317.14]  It can.
[3317.14 --> 3323.52]  In fact, it can teach you many of the skills that you'll need to work on your Squarespace
[3323.52 --> 3323.92]  website.
[3324.04 --> 3324.14]  Okay.
[3324.18 --> 3325.02]  Let's talk about Lynda.com.
[3325.10 --> 3331.08]  So, they've got more than 3,000 courses available with topics like web development, photography,
[3331.32 --> 3332.24]  visual design, and business.
[3332.42 --> 3335.60]  They also do software training like Excel and WordPress, Photoshop.
[3336.48 --> 3340.82]  Now, the thing about Lynda.com is it's not just for you young tech-savvy kids.
[3341.06 --> 3345.64]  It can be for people like your parents if they're looking to become young tech-savvy kids and
[3345.64 --> 3348.70]  they've given up on the young part and kids part because they're your parents.
[3348.82 --> 3352.38]  They can't be kids unless, of course, they have parents, in which case they would be
[3352.38 --> 3352.60]  kids.
[3352.70 --> 3352.92]  They can be young parents.
[3353.20 --> 3357.16]  So, the point is whether you want to set new financial goals, find work-life balance,
[3357.28 --> 3361.14]  invest in a new hobby, ask your boss for a raise, find a new job, or improve upon your
[3361.14 --> 3364.72]  current skill sets, invest in Lynda.com.
[3364.78 --> 3369.52]  You can get a 10-day free all-you-can-eat trial and plans start at only $25 a month.
[3369.52 --> 3374.88]  Head over to Lynda.com slash WAN show to try it out and start learning today, which leads us
[3374.88 --> 3375.90]  into the second sponsor.
[3376.00 --> 3377.98]  Now, I did set that deadline.
[3378.10 --> 3381.16]  I didn't realize we'd be doing a Squarespace spot the following week.
[3381.74 --> 3384.00]  Did you by any chance get the migration finished?
[3384.18 --> 3384.80]  It's there.
[3385.40 --> 3386.20]  It's not done yet.
[3386.30 --> 3387.68]  It's not fully done yet.
[3387.72 --> 3387.98]  Okay.
[3388.30 --> 3389.68]  Let's wait for the next one.
[3389.76 --> 3389.96]  Okay.
[3390.10 --> 3395.74]  So, for those of you who missed it, I was mortified through the entire Squarespace sponsor
[3395.74 --> 3401.14]  spot last week because Luke, in his infinite bloody wisdom, told me that his mom's site,
[3401.14 --> 3405.74]  which we'll show you next Squarespace spot, his mom's site was on Squarespace, and that's
[3405.74 --> 3407.78]  why it was great and stable and wouldn't crash.
[3408.10 --> 3414.58]  So, I was like, yeah, I'm totally getting, like, I'm totally getting worked like a, like
[3414.58 --> 3417.42]  a, like a, like a, a, a cookie dough.
[3418.54 --> 3419.28]  I couldn't think of something.
[3419.28 --> 3420.04]  You got there.
[3420.20 --> 3421.10]  It's fine.
[3421.36 --> 3421.38]  Yeah.
[3421.38 --> 3425.22]  I'm totally getting, I'm totally getting worked here, but we're going to show the site
[3425.22 --> 3425.54]  anyway.
[3425.72 --> 3426.82]  Here's Luke's mom's site.
[3426.82 --> 3429.90]  It crashed immediately because it wasn't actually on Squarespace.
[3430.36 --> 3432.00]  So, I'm sitting there.
[3432.12 --> 3438.56]  We've got hostgator.com or something on my screen share in the middle of me doing a Squarespace
[3438.56 --> 3442.94]  ad integration, and I'm like, wow, I really hope they don't watch this.
[3443.18 --> 3451.54]  I got an email, like, three hours later from our Squarespace contact, who's not just our
[3451.54 --> 3452.32]  Squarespace contact.
[3452.62 --> 3453.98]  He watches the show.
[3454.40 --> 3454.96]  Okay.
[3454.96 --> 3458.04]  I was hoping he missed it that week.
[3458.40 --> 3461.08]  And he's just like, dude, that was hilarious.
[3461.54 --> 3464.00]  That was like the funniest thing I've ever watched.
[3464.36 --> 3467.96]  Like, I swear, he enjoyed watching me stew.
[3468.94 --> 3470.42]  So, they haven't dropped us.
[3471.00 --> 3473.46]  They're still, they're still sponsoring us.
[3473.88 --> 3475.50]  And why do we love Squarespace?
[3475.86 --> 3478.02]  Well, because they have a rockin' ass product.
[3478.24 --> 3482.60]  You can make yourself a cool website, whether it's for a store, a blog, a portfolio, or you
[3482.60 --> 3484.88]  just want to make a website because you think websites are cool.
[3485.22 --> 3486.84]  Their plans start at $8 a month.
[3486.94 --> 3489.72]  They'll throw in a free domain if you sign up for an entire year.
[3489.72 --> 3493.72]  You can save 10% if you use offer code Linus on Squarespace.com.
[3494.64 --> 3498.32]  Their websites work great across a variety of devices, and they make it so easy anyone can
[3498.32 --> 3500.98]  do it with 24-7 email tech support.
[3500.98 --> 3503.12]  But why else do we like working with Squarespace?
[3503.48 --> 3505.26]  Because they have a sense of humor.
[3505.82 --> 3507.80]  And they can handle working with us.
[3509.56 --> 3514.06]  They've worked with us for a long time, and they've seen some bad sponsor spots.
[3514.08 --> 3514.64]  Oh, man.
[3515.18 --> 3517.10]  The worst of which was last week.
[3517.20 --> 3517.56]  Yes.
[3517.78 --> 3518.76]  There's been many bad ones.
[3518.76 --> 3521.62]  They put up with us anyway, and that's what business is about.
[3521.70 --> 3522.70]  It's about relationships.
[3523.52 --> 3525.36]  We have dropped sponsors.
[3525.36 --> 3530.22]  I don't like airing dirty laundry, and I'm not going to name any names, but some people
[3530.22 --> 3533.44]  figured out one of them when we did a Jack Threads integration recently.
[3533.64 --> 3540.70]  So we have dropped sponsors because it's all about figuring out, are you working together?
[3540.86 --> 3545.48]  And sometimes we get a complaint about a sponsor, whether it's through our forum or through
[3545.48 --> 3549.58]  contact information on our website, which is powered by Squarespace, not the forum, by
[3549.58 --> 3549.78]  the way.
[3549.82 --> 3550.88]  They don't have a forum module.
[3551.50 --> 3553.60]  But just the Linus Media Group.com website.
[3554.10 --> 3554.54]  They should.
[3554.54 --> 3560.56]  We get complaints sometimes, and that doesn't mean we drop a sponsor immediately because
[3560.56 --> 3562.32]  there's always going to be trouble.
[3563.18 --> 3569.92]  But when we take that to the sponsor and they don't deal with it in an awesome manner right
[3569.92 --> 3574.30]  away, then we see that as a huge problem because we don't want to be repping guys that aren't
[3574.30 --> 3575.38]  taking care of you guys.
[3575.54 --> 3576.14]  Non-awesome.
[3576.14 --> 3582.98]  That puts us in a super awkward position where we have to be bad people, basically, and neither
[3582.98 --> 3584.68]  Luke nor I wants to be bad people.
[3585.02 --> 3585.32]  Nope.
[3585.48 --> 3587.36]  We might roleplay bad people sometimes.
[3587.48 --> 3589.38]  But that's not actually being bad people.
[3589.38 --> 3595.48]  Anyways, moving on.
[3596.80 --> 3598.92]  We have more news about things.
[3599.48 --> 3601.50]  Yeah, some of these are very rapid fire.
[3602.08 --> 3603.68]  Windows 10 will be rolling out in...
[3603.68 --> 3604.64]  Yeah, we'll talk about...
[3604.64 --> 3605.68]  Yeah, yeah, that's a big deal.
[3606.06 --> 3607.94]  Windows 10 will be rolling out in waves.
[3608.00 --> 3609.20]  Not everyone will get it at launch.
[3609.26 --> 3611.06]  This was posted by Boozoo on the forum.
[3611.06 --> 3614.52]  But if you have the little Windows icon in the bottom right-hand corner of your computer
[3614.52 --> 3617.80]  and you've reserved already, then you'll get it in the first wave.
[3618.28 --> 3621.36]  So that's great because I, like, hardcore did that.
[3621.62 --> 3621.84]  I think...
[3621.84 --> 3622.82]  I did that on one of my computers.
[3622.84 --> 3623.66]  Oh my god, did I reserve this one?
[3624.62 --> 3625.52]  Yes, I think I did.
[3625.82 --> 3629.44]  I did it on one of my computers and then I tried to do it on my other one and it never
[3629.44 --> 3631.02]  gave me the option to actually reserve it.
[3631.48 --> 3635.24]  Oh, maybe that is what happened because I have reserved on...
[3635.24 --> 3636.72]  Oh, maybe this one didn't reserve.
[3637.20 --> 3638.98]  No, but I got a confirmation for this one.
[3639.26 --> 3639.38]  Yeah.
[3639.38 --> 3640.16]  View confirmation.
[3640.38 --> 3641.94]  Okay, I'll go do that on my other computer.
[3642.18 --> 3646.22]  Yeah, click view confirmation and then you guys should be able to see...
[3646.22 --> 3646.58]  Bloody hell.
[3646.94 --> 3648.32]  Your upgrade is reserved.
[3648.80 --> 3651.12]  So if you have that, then you should be okay.
[3651.84 --> 3652.06]  Yeah.
[3652.20 --> 3653.74]  And you can cancel your reservation apparently.
[3653.84 --> 3654.82]  I had no idea you could do that.
[3655.16 --> 3655.28]  That's cool.
[3655.28 --> 3655.94]  Well, I don't want to.
[3656.00 --> 3656.86]  I want Windows 10.
[3657.12 --> 3657.44]  Me too.
[3657.54 --> 3658.84]  What else we got here?
[3659.16 --> 3661.12]  The Plex forums were compromised.
[3661.40 --> 3664.18]  Hackers gained IP addresses, passwords, and more.
[3664.68 --> 3666.54]  So this was originally posted on Droid Life.
[3666.64 --> 3668.40]  I'm going to go ahead and fire that up here.
[3669.38 --> 3670.48]  Did you post this in the Twitch chat?
[3670.48 --> 3672.26]  They got encrypted forum passwords.
[3672.84 --> 3673.02]  Yeah.
[3673.90 --> 3674.34]  Although...
[3675.34 --> 3676.14]  Hmm.
[3676.44 --> 3677.92]  I'm going to go grab the Microsoft one.
[3682.84 --> 3683.28]  Yeah?
[3683.66 --> 3684.00]  Okay.
[3684.00 --> 3688.38]  Encrypted forum passwords are not always the most secure thing in the world.
[3688.48 --> 3694.70]  Now, to be clear, the ones on linustechtips.com currently using IP Board...
[3694.70 --> 3695.90]  Thumbs up.
[3696.24 --> 3703.24]  But we have encountered in the past with other forum software user password encryption that
[3703.24 --> 3711.16]  was not strong enough to resist some fairly rudimentary migration, so to speak.
[3715.80 --> 3716.68]  That is all.
[3717.18 --> 3718.50]  That is all we have to say.
[3718.58 --> 3722.76]  That made us very, very uncomfortable, and absolutely everything was destroyed immediately.
[3723.62 --> 3724.84]  So there you go.
[3724.84 --> 3726.22]  So there you go.
[3726.30 --> 3728.72]  If you're on Plex, then you should probably be...
[3728.72 --> 3732.58]  You should probably be not using that password anywhere else ever and stuff like that.
[3733.02 --> 3739.06]  Just in general, highly recommend using a password keeper so that things like bunk passwords
[3739.06 --> 3740.22]  can be changed without...
[3740.22 --> 3743.62]  So you can use different passwords everywhere without actually having to remember them all.
[3744.64 --> 3749.86]  We should probably do like an LSD episode of password keepers, because you've done a fair
[3749.86 --> 3750.76]  bit of research on them.
[3751.00 --> 3754.74]  I have, but I'm finding issues.
[3754.86 --> 3757.34]  For every piece of good news, there's two pieces of bad news.
[3757.74 --> 3759.14]  Yeah, that's how it kind of goes, isn't it?
[3759.20 --> 3759.40]  Yeah.
[3761.72 --> 3763.46]  So this is really interesting.
[3764.00 --> 3767.88]  Facebook sets to become a serious YouTube competitor.
[3768.60 --> 3774.64]  Original article here is from Recode.net, and I don't know how much stock I would put
[3774.64 --> 3779.58]  in this, but did you ever read that article that I sent you and Nick that was subject line
[3779.58 --> 3780.34]  required reading?
[3780.50 --> 3780.68]  Yeah, yeah.
[3780.80 --> 3781.32]  So...
[3781.32 --> 3782.72]  Did you...
[3782.72 --> 3785.18]  Yes, I did.
[3785.78 --> 3786.74]  Subtle hint there.
[3787.96 --> 3792.34]  Yeah, so I read and Luke read, or at least he tells me he read.
[3792.54 --> 3795.74]  Actually, no, you replied to that with some insightful comments.
[3795.74 --> 3795.98]  I did.
[3795.98 --> 3797.04]  So, okay, I believe you read it.
[3797.52 --> 3802.06]  So we read, not together, like sitting together on the couch, like reading it together.
[3802.06 --> 3810.72]  Um, we read a really cool article about how much traction Facebook has in online video
[3810.72 --> 3813.28]  without anyone actually really realizing it.
[3813.34 --> 3817.58]  And it makes sense because of the amount of sheer views that like our videos get.
[3817.68 --> 3817.82]  Yeah.
[3817.82 --> 3823.58]  And little tweaks that Facebook has put in place, like autoplay as you're scrolling past
[3823.58 --> 3825.90]  it, with manual audio enabling.
[3826.92 --> 3828.00]  Smartest thing ever.
[3828.18 --> 3833.64]  I mean, that's what some newer platforms like Vessel, for example, is doing stuff like that.
[3834.02 --> 3839.22]  Video thumbnails inspired by Harry Potter is apparently what Facebook's developers said
[3839.22 --> 3841.26]  about this feature.
[3841.26 --> 3844.48]  It makes sense because if it's moving, it's going to be more interesting.
[3844.80 --> 3845.12]  Yes!
[3845.62 --> 3845.76]  Yes.
[3845.76 --> 3850.68]  There's legitimately been videos on Facebook that I've seen start going, especially very
[3850.68 --> 3852.88]  action-heavy ones, like super fun style videos.
[3852.90 --> 3853.14]  Yep.
[3853.34 --> 3855.76]  That I've been like, oh, whoa, okay, wait, that looks pretty interesting.
[3855.94 --> 3861.04]  When you see the ball sitting still at the top of the green hill, the big red ball, it's
[3861.04 --> 3861.80]  like, oh, okay.
[3861.84 --> 3864.54]  When you see a bunch of dudes shoving it down the hill.
[3864.54 --> 3864.90]  Yes.
[3864.90 --> 3866.06]  It's like, okay, that's more interesting.
[3866.12 --> 3870.76]  And I mean, we obviously believe that online video is the future.
[3870.76 --> 3876.18]  We wouldn't be investing our lives in creating online video, I like to think.
[3877.22 --> 3882.72]  But Facebook is set to change the game a little bit.
[3882.74 --> 3888.50]  Because right now, I mean, Facebook for premium content, I consider kind of laughable.
[3888.60 --> 3894.84]  I don't expect someone to watch an entire video in that tiny window, like an entire review
[3894.84 --> 3896.42]  in that tiny little window.
[3896.42 --> 3902.10]  Facebook doesn't have tools for creators that allow us to see things like audience engagement.
[3902.10 --> 3903.30]  We can see a view number.
[3903.68 --> 3905.06]  We don't know what they watched.
[3905.14 --> 3906.52]  We don't know how much they watched.
[3906.60 --> 3908.12]  We don't know how engaged they were.
[3908.26 --> 3909.60]  It's really very meaningless.
[3909.76 --> 3914.34]  Like, they're still way behind in terms of more premium content, something that YouTube
[3914.34 --> 3916.06]  has made enormous strides towards.
[3916.06 --> 3921.72]  But one of the big obstacles that prevented people from even wanting to post on Facebook
[3921.72 --> 3924.76]  was that Facebook wasn't sharing ad revenue.
[3925.28 --> 3927.80]  Well, now, that's the big news.
[3928.08 --> 3931.28]  Facebook will start sharing ad revenue with video creators.
[3931.74 --> 3934.74]  Same rev split as YouTube, which is pretty interesting.
[3934.74 --> 3935.74]  Yeah.
[3935.74 --> 3937.30]  Um, yeah.
[3937.50 --> 3937.92]  I don't know.
[3938.08 --> 3940.74]  The shareability of Facebook is intense.
[3941.30 --> 3941.52]  Yeah.
[3941.70 --> 3942.88]  Like, wow.
[3942.98 --> 3943.74]  Totally different.
[3944.52 --> 3950.80]  Like, it's like if YouTube's mainstream, Facebook is like, is like you're born with it
[3950.80 --> 3951.42]  kind of thing.
[3951.48 --> 3953.08]  Like, Facebook is super mainstream.
[3953.08 --> 3953.98]  People are starting to do that.
[3954.06 --> 3956.22]  People are starting to make Facebook accounts for their kids.
[3956.32 --> 3956.76]  Absolutely.
[3957.04 --> 3957.78]  It's the same idea.
[3957.96 --> 3961.08]  You were talking about this a while ago about making a Gmail account.
[3961.58 --> 3961.74]  Yeah.
[3961.74 --> 3962.84]  It's the same kind of idea.
[3962.94 --> 3965.80]  You post things to their Facebook page before they actually start using it.
[3965.88 --> 3966.02]  Yep.
[3966.42 --> 3966.64]  Yep.
[3966.70 --> 3970.78]  This is, this is all, this is all stuff that is, that is a big deal.
[3970.86 --> 3976.64]  And I mean, we as online video creators didn't even really need more of an incentive to upload
[3976.64 --> 3978.14]  to Facebook because it's super simple.
[3978.24 --> 3980.40]  You just drag and drop and you copy paste.
[3980.40 --> 3983.98]  Like, if you're already publishing somewhere, this is, this is really interesting.
[3984.10 --> 3989.36]  We're at the very final stages of signing a deal to get our content translated and posted
[3989.36 --> 3990.96]  on Chinese video sharing sites.
[3990.96 --> 3994.82]  So, so it'll actually have a Mandarin subtitles.
[3995.28 --> 3995.42]  Yeah.
[3996.02 --> 3999.94]  And baked into the videos and this will be an official Linus media group endeavor.
[4000.08 --> 4005.64]  So, so for us posting to something like Facebook where English is fine is even way less work.
[4005.64 --> 4010.62]  Um, so we've been posting there regardless of whether we're getting an ad share or not.
[4010.62 --> 4010.98]  Yeah.
[4010.98 --> 4016.66]  And so now to be offered an ad share is even more compelling because it's just more reach.
[4016.76 --> 4017.88]  It's just a broader audience.
[4017.88 --> 4024.00]  I thought in the early days of Linus tech tips, you know, maybe it'll be possible to have
[4024.00 --> 4025.68]  a hundred thousand subscribers someday.
[4026.10 --> 4030.28]  Maybe there are a hundred thousand people on earth who are interested in the kind of technology
[4030.28 --> 4031.14]  that I talk about.
[4031.68 --> 4032.74]  That's what I thought.
[4032.74 --> 4039.92]  And I learned day after day, week after week that the sky's the limit on this thing.
[4040.30 --> 4043.08]  New enthusiasts are born every day.
[4043.80 --> 4047.42]  And I don't mean that in the like, ha ha, it's a play on the suckers born every minute.
[4047.50 --> 4048.70]  No, no, it's not like that.
[4048.74 --> 4051.32]  It's just, we're replenishing our supply.
[4051.86 --> 4056.70]  New enthusiasts are coming to take the place of the ones who, you know, lose interest or,
[4056.86 --> 4058.06]  or whatever the case may be.
[4058.12 --> 4060.20]  And so that's how we've continued to grow.
[4060.28 --> 4063.82]  And, and, and this audience is, is, it seems like practically unlimited.
[4064.16 --> 4068.44]  So yeah, we're going to post to more video sharing sites and yeah, it's a good thing.
[4068.96 --> 4069.78]  Um, what's up?
[4069.78 --> 4075.72]  Jopple, ask people where they're, where they like watching videos the most and do like a
[4075.72 --> 4077.58]  bunch of the kind of main ones.
[4077.58 --> 4085.14]  So Facebook, uh, YouTube, YouTube, um, Vessel.
[4085.40 --> 4086.52]  Where else do we publish?
[4086.70 --> 4090.34]  We'll, we'll do Google plus as, uh, YouTube because it is.
[4090.96 --> 4091.98]  Um, mobile.
[4093.04 --> 4093.60]  Mobile.
[4093.88 --> 4094.72]  Is that fair?
[4095.24 --> 4095.54]  Yeah.
[4095.54 --> 4097.90]  Because a lot of these things have mobile options though.
[4099.12 --> 4101.48]  Um, can I segment it out?
[4103.54 --> 4105.12]  Can I say YouTube desktop?
[4105.12 --> 4109.00]  That's going to be a lot of pull options, but sure you can add more.
[4109.24 --> 4109.52]  So yeah.
[4110.12 --> 4110.32]  Yeah.
[4110.36 --> 4114.18]  Does Google, so, so through, I don't, when we say Google plus, we're talking like through
[4114.18 --> 4117.86]  Google plus, like you're actually on Google plus watching, like viewing a video.
[4117.98 --> 4119.52]  Isn't that just YouTube links though?
[4119.66 --> 4120.70]  Embedded YouTube videos?
[4122.38 --> 4122.78]  Yes.
[4123.60 --> 4124.24]  I think so.
[4124.24 --> 4124.52]  Okay.
[4124.52 --> 4124.74]  Okay.
[4124.74 --> 4125.74]  So let's leave that out.
[4125.90 --> 4127.22]  And I'm actually going to switch.
[4127.42 --> 4130.68]  I'm going to, uh, I'm going to, uh, break out iOS and Android.
[4131.10 --> 4131.44]  Okay.
[4131.88 --> 4137.22]  Um, and then I, I'll, I'll leave in another, uh, can you think of anything else?
[4137.40 --> 4137.64]  Daily motion?
[4138.48 --> 4140.96]  I don't think it's going to get any votes, but daily motion.
[4141.84 --> 4145.58]  I, I already know the answer to that because our videos have been on daily motion forever.
[4145.80 --> 4149.78]  Like we've been, um, like it's actually automatically uploaded from YouTube.
[4150.62 --> 4154.82]  Um, like there's an official LTT daily motion and no one watches it.
[4154.90 --> 4155.08]  No.
[4155.08 --> 4157.14]  Um, like what else is there?
[4158.90 --> 4160.88]  I mean, really Facebook and YouTube are the ones that-
[4160.88 --> 4161.36]  Twitch, yeah.
[4161.50 --> 4162.68]  Twitch is something I was thinking about.
[4162.76 --> 4165.82]  So Twitch, um, uh, Azubu.
[4168.06 --> 4172.16]  And we're talking in terms of experience, not necessarily where you watch.
[4172.60 --> 4174.32]  Where do you prefer to watch?
[4174.32 --> 4178.34]  Who delivers the best online video watching experience in your mind?
[4179.46 --> 4182.52]  And there's a lot of different ways to interpret this and you'll just have to kind of leave it
[4182.52 --> 4188.02]  up to you whether you, whether your experience is mostly dictated by the, you know, the compression
[4188.02 --> 4192.76]  algorithm or whether your experience is mostly dictated by the discoverability of fun new
[4192.76 --> 4193.28]  content.
[4193.50 --> 4195.16]  Uh, that's entirely up to you.
[4195.38 --> 4196.30]  GOM TV, GOM.
[4196.36 --> 4196.90]  Oh, sorry.
[4196.98 --> 4197.18]  I already created it.
[4197.18 --> 4197.54]  It's fine.
[4197.64 --> 4198.64]  It's not going to get in anyways.
[4199.34 --> 4199.62]  Okay.
[4199.68 --> 4201.08]  So I'm going to go ahead and post that.
[4201.08 --> 4201.60]  Um.
[4204.80 --> 4205.72]  Who was saying Vessel?
[4205.82 --> 4206.54]  Vessel's in there.
[4206.60 --> 4207.12]  Vessel's in there.
[4207.18 --> 4207.26]  Yeah.
[4207.32 --> 4207.98]  Don't worry about it.
[4208.00 --> 4209.00]  Oh, Vimeo.
[4209.64 --> 4210.96]  Oh, we, okay.
[4210.96 --> 4215.20]  Uh, people, people who want Vimeo, just, just other.
[4215.34 --> 4217.68]  I mean, basically other is going to be Vimeo at this point, I think.
[4218.04 --> 4218.34]  Yeah.
[4218.82 --> 4221.16]  Uh, so hold on.
[4221.18 --> 4223.22]  I wanted to go back to the notes from that Facebook thing.
[4224.76 --> 4229.78]  So Facebook claims they can get more eyeballs than YouTube by being a social network first
[4229.78 --> 4233.22]  and video platform second, which I think is an interesting point because I would make
[4233.22 --> 4236.56]  the argument that YouTube is very much a social network.
[4236.68 --> 4238.88]  I mean, to call it anything else is sort of stupid.
[4238.88 --> 4242.90]  Um, they're saying it's a social network first.
[4243.04 --> 4244.34]  They're not saying it's not a social network.
[4244.34 --> 4245.42]  Yes, that's true.
[4245.76 --> 4254.56]  Um, but one thing that they are correct about is that YouTube's social network is less, less
[4254.56 --> 4256.04]  a group oriented.
[4256.04 --> 4261.46]  It's more wheel and spoke where it's like, you've got your hubs, the creators, and then
[4261.46 --> 4263.18]  you've got the people interacting with them.
[4263.18 --> 4267.48]  The spokes don't interact with each other as much the way that they would on something
[4267.48 --> 4270.98]  like Facebook, where it's all spokes pretty much.
[4271.14 --> 4273.96]  And then hubs are just bigger spokes, so to speak.
[4274.60 --> 4277.18]  Um, and this is an interesting quote.
[4277.26 --> 4279.30]  Those people don't need to be following your Facebook page either.
[4279.80 --> 4283.30]  Last I checked, someone can Google search how to build a computer and they can find our
[4283.30 --> 4283.60]  videos.
[4283.70 --> 4288.00]  They don't have to be following us on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google plus, or, you know,
[4288.00 --> 4291.56]  this poll is going to be extremely skewed.
[4292.22 --> 4298.18]  I know, I know, but it's still, you know, it's always nice to hear from the Twitch chat.
[4298.26 --> 4299.32]  Well, yeah, no, it's true.
[4299.44 --> 4303.14]  I just, something that I thought of outside of the fact that everyone's watching on Twitch
[4303.14 --> 4309.52]  right now is that, um, the mobile versions are going to be harder to vote on.
[4310.68 --> 4311.08]  Yes!
[4311.52 --> 4311.98]  Ha ha!
[4312.52 --> 4314.10]  Oh, poor you guys.
[4314.20 --> 4315.18]  I didn't think about that.
[4315.18 --> 4319.14]  So Android and iOS would probably be considerably higher.
[4319.50 --> 4320.52]  So this is interesting.
[4321.28 --> 4325.90]  Well, no, remember too, though, the question is where do you prefer to watch videos?
[4326.18 --> 4328.08]  Not where do you do it necessarily.
[4328.42 --> 4331.14]  Yeah, but if someone's currently doing it, there's a higher percentage of likeliness
[4331.14 --> 4332.48]  that they're going to prefer doing it.
[4332.54 --> 4333.20]  That's true.
[4333.68 --> 4334.74]  That's very true.
[4335.40 --> 4341.00]  Still, overwhelming majority, majority, majority, overwhelming majority are saying YouTube
[4341.00 --> 4341.46]  desktop.
[4341.60 --> 4343.16]  I think it would be that way anyways.
[4343.16 --> 4345.32]  I just think the numbers would be slightly different.
[4345.42 --> 4349.42]  Yeah, because I mean, we see from our mobile viewership numbers that more of you are watching
[4349.42 --> 4352.48]  on mobile than necessarily prefer to watch on mobile.
[4352.86 --> 4352.98]  Yeah.
[4353.14 --> 4356.10]  Um, with actually 7% of you saying Vessel.
[4356.22 --> 4361.40]  You know, Vessel implemented a really cool feature recently where the video just gets small
[4361.40 --> 4363.74]  and plays at the top when you scroll and read the comments.
[4363.76 --> 4364.22]  Yeah, I noticed that.
[4364.48 --> 4369.76]  As a creator, 95% of what I'm interested in on the video playback page is comments.
[4369.78 --> 4370.58]  Is the comments, yeah.
[4370.70 --> 4374.58]  And so being able to kind of watch the video in the corner of my eye is like, oh yeah,
[4374.62 --> 4375.26]  that's kind of neat.
[4375.50 --> 4378.24]  Because a lot of the time the editors throw in stuff that I don't think of.
[4378.46 --> 4378.70]  Yeah.
[4379.14 --> 4380.08]  Especially fast as possible.
[4380.32 --> 4381.22]  And Channel Super Fun.
[4381.22 --> 4383.86]  Those are as much fun for me to watch as you guys, I think.
[4384.86 --> 4386.96]  We've got some fun Channel Super Fun's coming.
[4387.10 --> 4388.20]  We actually filmed...
[4388.20 --> 4389.78]  You weren't here yesterday!
[4390.18 --> 4392.76]  I haven't properly been in one in like a month and a half.
[4393.02 --> 4393.90]  Oh my goodness!
[4394.58 --> 4395.54]  Okay, so...
[4395.54 --> 4396.84]  It's been a long time.
[4397.00 --> 4399.12]  The golf one is pretty hilarious.
[4399.12 --> 4401.74]  I had Jack from NCIX Tech Tips film with me.
[4402.16 --> 4406.66]  And so we play golf on a pitch and putt course with plastic clubs and plastic balls.
[4406.96 --> 4407.04]  Yeah.
[4407.04 --> 4411.36]  And then the one we filmed yesterday is this game, if you can even call it a game.
[4411.48 --> 4412.64]  It's just stupid.
[4413.44 --> 4415.76]  Where you hold four handles.
[4416.26 --> 4417.42]  Each person holds a handle.
[4417.76 --> 4421.62]  And then it plays spooky music and like a light changes color.
[4421.94 --> 4424.60]  And you have to press the button as fast as you can or you get an electric shock.
[4425.26 --> 4427.36]  And it's pretty similar to the dog collars.
[4427.72 --> 4428.46]  Okay, wow.
[4428.68 --> 4428.72]  So it's like...
[4428.72 --> 4430.46]  It's not like, hey, you were last.
[4430.52 --> 4432.80]  It's like, hey, don't be last again!
[4432.88 --> 4433.04]  Yeah.
[4435.28 --> 4436.12]  Poor Brandon.
[4436.12 --> 4437.48]  That's all I have to say.
[4440.02 --> 4443.38]  And like, the more times you get shocked, it seems like the slower Brandon gets.
[4444.18 --> 4444.54]  Probably.
[4444.88 --> 4445.54]  That makes sense.
[4451.50 --> 4451.98]  What's up?
[4452.04 --> 4453.58]  There's selfie pay from MasterCard.
[4453.60 --> 4454.80]  I actually didn't read this.
[4454.84 --> 4455.64]  What the hell is this?
[4455.68 --> 4457.32]  This is posted by Jaws on the forum.
[4457.88 --> 4461.96]  I'm going to let you handle this because I actually didn't make it this far in my doc prep today.
[4461.96 --> 4466.16]  I was busy organizing all the videos that I need to do over the next couple of months.
[4466.50 --> 4476.22]  It turns out that if not a single new product were released, nor a single new idea generated by anyone who works at Linus Media Group, we would have enough content to make it through the next quarter or so.
[4476.60 --> 4476.80]  Yep.
[4477.80 --> 4478.16]  Oops.
[4478.16 --> 4482.98]  There's some interesting counterpoints to this whole idea.
[4482.98 --> 4491.94]  But basically, you get a Microsoft, or Microsoft, you get a MasterCard app on your phone, and then for authorization of payment, you take a selfie.
[4492.40 --> 4494.02]  So it uses facial recognition.
[4494.42 --> 4498.40]  Now, to get around people using still photos, they make you blink once.
[4498.40 --> 4502.82]  But that doesn't mean you couldn't just hold the phone there.
[4503.38 --> 4505.80]  No, because getting a video of someone blinking once...
[4505.80 --> 4510.68]  Hold on, I'm going to switch to full screen so you can see the look on my face better.
[4511.80 --> 4513.68]  I think that's what a lot of people did.
[4515.26 --> 4527.90]  A bunch of people are saying from a privacy standpoint, this is awful, because then MasterCard is just going to have endless amounts of videos of you looking at a camera and all of your banking information.
[4527.90 --> 4531.72]  But MasterCard is stating that they're only holding ones and zeros.
[4532.66 --> 4536.14]  Not photos or fingerprints, which are made of ones and zeros.
[4542.02 --> 4543.32]  Anyways, it's super weird.
[4544.06 --> 4544.80]  I don't really know.
[4545.24 --> 4550.92]  One thing that you guys might be enjoying right now is that HTML5 chat is now live on Twitch.
[4551.10 --> 4552.78]  I'm going to post this into the Twitch chat.
[4553.66 --> 4554.38]  Okay, I can...
[4554.38 --> 4556.42]  My face actually started to stick there.
[4557.40 --> 4557.70]  Oh, wow.
[4557.70 --> 4559.56]  I'm super not impressed with selfie pay.
[4559.92 --> 4560.20]  No.
[4561.24 --> 4562.30]  I don't think many people care.
[4562.38 --> 4566.04]  It's like, why does it take Apple to revolutionize mobile payments?
[4566.24 --> 4568.28]  Because everyone else is a complete idiot.
[4568.68 --> 4571.46]  Because people at MasterCard were like, the young people.
[4571.90 --> 4573.54]  The young people like taking selfies.
[4574.30 --> 4576.56]  Let's make credit card selfies.
[4577.84 --> 4580.08]  Anyways, apparently it kicked off on June 30th.
[4580.08 --> 4583.80]  It's actually a lot better than the previous Flash-based chat.
[4583.80 --> 4586.28]  Thank freaking goodness that we're getting away from Flash.
[4586.76 --> 4588.96]  Chat loads apparently four times faster.
[4589.10 --> 4591.34]  Chat uses fewer CPU resources.
[4591.78 --> 4596.02]  And you don't need to do anything to upgrade as long as you're using a WebSocket-capable browser.
[4596.02 --> 4598.62]  Let's do a thing.
[4599.40 --> 4602.06]  Let's reload this page and see if the chat slows it down.
[4602.06 --> 4609.52]  It worked.
[4610.52 --> 4612.00]  We benchmarked it.
[4612.44 --> 4613.08]  Wow.
[4613.08 --> 4616.60]  Oh, geez.
[4617.80 --> 4621.54]  Luckily, most benchmarks online as tech tips are better than that.
[4623.66 --> 4626.62]  Actually have some amount of comparative data.
[4626.62 --> 4630.54]  Actually have an ounce of thought put into them.
[4631.08 --> 4633.16]  I'm going to F5 and see what happens.
[4633.34 --> 4633.54]  Woo!
[4634.12 --> 4634.58]  Woo!
[4636.06 --> 4636.54]  Okay.
[4636.84 --> 4637.98]  Anyways, that's super cool.
[4638.08 --> 4639.54]  I'm very happy about that, personally.
[4639.66 --> 4640.68]  What else do we have to say?
[4640.74 --> 4642.22]  Oh, iPhone 6S leaks.
[4642.32 --> 4642.50]  Right.
[4642.68 --> 4645.50]  Original article here is from 9to5Mac.
[4645.94 --> 4649.26]  So the chassis has been revealed.
[4650.02 --> 4656.08]  This is really unexpected to people who have never seen an Apple product release cycle before.
[4656.62 --> 4662.86]  But the iPhone 6S will look nearly identical outside, but will feature numerous changes inside.
[4663.00 --> 4668.90]  Right when the iPhone 7 comes out, we should release a chassis leak of the iPhone 7S.
[4669.16 --> 4669.84]  We should.
[4670.10 --> 4670.88]  We'd be first.
[4672.18 --> 4672.72]  Yes.
[4672.84 --> 4673.56]  That would be awesome.
[4673.82 --> 4677.72]  So according to the leak, basically nothing is going to change about the outside.
[4677.84 --> 4679.70]  In fact, even less than usual.
[4679.70 --> 4685.24]  Like in the past, we've seen things like an antenna line here or a logo there or whatever else.
[4685.24 --> 4687.00]  Like little tiny changes.
[4687.34 --> 4692.08]  This time it looks like pretty much nothing in spite of Apple's patent filing for a way
[4692.08 --> 4695.60]  to anodize their antenna lines.
[4696.18 --> 4698.86]  Which personally, I don't even mind the antenna line.
[4699.02 --> 4700.14]  I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[4700.22 --> 4702.20]  I mean, we're not talking like panty lines here.
[4702.26 --> 4703.40]  It's just an antenna line.
[4703.40 --> 4705.34]  Everybody's got to have antennas.
[4705.50 --> 4707.80]  And we all know that no one should be wearing panties.
[4707.92 --> 4709.94]  So that's why it's much less offensive.
[4710.16 --> 4711.32]  You just like people going commando?
[4711.56 --> 4712.06]  Oh yeah.
[4712.50 --> 4713.56]  I'm all about the commando.
[4713.58 --> 4714.36]  Are you commando right now?
[4715.06 --> 4716.46]  Um, no.
[4716.68 --> 4719.58]  But I'm wearing skin tight panties so you don't see the lines.
[4719.82 --> 4720.58]  What color are they?
[4720.74 --> 4721.26]  They're black.
[4722.20 --> 4722.58]  Because I know...
[4722.58 --> 4724.40]  Is that like a glossy black or a matte black?
[4724.40 --> 4728.94]  Remember, black panties are only for when you expect and or want someone to see them.
[4730.54 --> 4731.30]  Is this from me?
[4731.80 --> 4733.18]  I think it's from Are You There, God?
[4733.22 --> 4733.80]  It's Me, Margaret.
[4735.12 --> 4735.90]  Which is a book.
[4736.90 --> 4737.88]  It might not be from that book.
[4737.90 --> 4738.28]  Did you enjoy that?
[4738.46 --> 4739.42]  It might not be a book at all.
[4739.56 --> 4742.78]  In Seattle, I got to see the Princess Bride props.
[4743.36 --> 4743.90]  No way.
[4743.96 --> 4744.70]  Physical props.
[4744.98 --> 4745.46]  Shut up.
[4745.52 --> 4745.76]  What?
[4746.58 --> 4747.52]  The swords.
[4747.84 --> 4748.52]  Shut up.
[4748.52 --> 4755.44]  Um, the, one of the main dresses, the, the, uh, the As You Wish suit thing.
[4755.84 --> 4756.68]  No way.
[4756.70 --> 4757.22]  In person.
[4758.28 --> 4758.68]  Sick.
[4758.80 --> 4760.02]  I didn't even know they had that there.
[4760.04 --> 4761.00]  Also Star Wars stuff.
[4761.06 --> 4763.48]  Is it touring or is it like a museum or something?
[4763.62 --> 4763.72]  Museum.
[4763.72 --> 4764.24]  Like, can I go?
[4764.58 --> 4764.90]  Yes.
[4765.18 --> 4765.88]  Oh my goodness.
[4765.96 --> 4766.44]  Oh wow.
[4766.72 --> 4767.58]  Also Star Wars.
[4767.84 --> 4770.38]  Wait, I think I'm, I'm going to Seattle shortly.
[4770.38 --> 4774.50]  Go to the, uh, EMP, EMP Museum.
[4774.62 --> 4775.54]  EMP Museum.
[4776.06 --> 4776.68]  Yeah, definitely.
[4777.00 --> 4778.24]  It's like right beside the Space Needle.
[4778.68 --> 4779.72]  Um, there's Star Wars.
[4779.84 --> 4780.88]  They have all the new stuff.
[4780.98 --> 4781.90]  They also have a bunch of old stuff.
[4781.98 --> 4784.26]  There's two main, like, themed rooms going on.
[4784.26 --> 4785.78]  Can I skip the new stuff?
[4786.74 --> 4787.06]  Yeah.
[4787.32 --> 4788.38]  Can I never look at it?
[4788.38 --> 4790.58]  I can tell you how to avoid the new stuff.
[4790.80 --> 4793.60]  Because I went to the new stuff and was like, I don't want to see any of this.
[4793.68 --> 4795.90]  And then eventually found the old stuff and was like, awesome!
[4796.30 --> 4798.30]  And then left and went to the other areas.
[4798.30 --> 4803.82]  But there's a fantasy area where they have, um, Princess Bride and they have Lord of the Rings and stuff in there as well.
[4804.14 --> 4806.70]  Then there's a sci-fi area that has, like, Star Wars stuff.
[4807.10 --> 4807.38]  Sweet.
[4807.38 --> 4808.32]  And Star Trek stuff.
[4808.38 --> 4810.00]  And then there's a dedicated Star Wars area.
[4810.10 --> 4811.24]  Oh, I have to go down there for that.
[4811.24 --> 4814.68]  I'm actually, I'm going down for, uh, Chris Perillo's Vlogger Fair thing.
[4814.90 --> 4815.28]  Oh, cool.
[4815.50 --> 4815.72]  Yeah.
[4815.98 --> 4817.88]  Uh, I'm only going down for, like, one day.
[4818.18 --> 4821.36]  Because I think there's, like, an industry day or something like that.
[4821.38 --> 4822.78]  And I'm like, yeah, I don't really care.
[4822.78 --> 4826.38]  Um, so if, like, if people want to go check it out, uh, Vlogger Fair.
[4826.58 --> 4830.30]  I have a discount code or something so you can get 15% off your admission.
[4831.10 --> 4833.86]  Um, I, I don't, I don't really, I don't, I don't know.
[4834.18 --> 4835.84]  I don't know how much admission costs or anything.
[4835.90 --> 4837.50]  Like, I'm not, I don't get paid or anything.
[4837.50 --> 4838.94]  I'm just going down to kind of hang out.
[4839.46 --> 4841.34]  And, uh, I couldn't make it last year.
[4841.38 --> 4843.46]  And I had told Chris that I really wanted to make it.
[4843.54 --> 4845.30]  So I can make it this year.
[4845.36 --> 4848.94]  So if I didn't make it this year, then I'd basically be just being a gigantic douche canoe.
[4849.14 --> 4850.60]  So I didn't want to do that.
[4850.82 --> 4851.08]  Um.
[4851.08 --> 4851.98]  But yeah, go to that thing.
[4852.06 --> 4854.06]  There's also, like, it's supposed to be a music place.
[4854.26 --> 4856.56]  The majority of the stuff in there is actually props.
[4856.80 --> 4858.50]  Oh, I give zero craps about that, so.
[4858.88 --> 4859.16]  Yeah.
[4859.42 --> 4860.88]  Yeah, there's, like, Nirvana and.
[4864.00 --> 4864.36]  Exactly.
[4865.62 --> 4866.82]  No, he's a big deal.
[4866.94 --> 4868.68]  He used to put acid in his headband.
[4869.44 --> 4869.96]  Jimi Hendrix.
[4870.00 --> 4870.32]  Yes.
[4870.62 --> 4872.78]  There's Jimi Hendrix and Nirvana for music exhibits.
[4872.78 --> 4875.30]  And then there's just, like, actually cool things at the props.
[4875.68 --> 4878.58]  Like, I, I, I like, I like the music stuff.
[4878.68 --> 4880.38]  But, like, there's, I don't know.
[4880.38 --> 4885.64]  It was much less interesting than the props, which I felt was weird considering it's a music museum.
[4885.96 --> 4886.10]  Right.
[4886.56 --> 4886.92]  Anyways.
[4887.18 --> 4893.72]  So the iPhone 6S will allegedly feature a pressure-sensitive display.
[4893.96 --> 4900.56]  So that's that new force-touch thing that we've seen on the MacBook 2015, where I really liked it,
[4900.60 --> 4905.58]  and the Apple Watch, where I think it's a gigantic steaming hunk of completely unnecessary nonsense.
[4906.16 --> 4910.18]  So whether they do a better job in the iPhone 6S remains to be seen.
[4910.38 --> 4913.66]  There was rumors that there would be a dual-element camera or something like that.
[4913.70 --> 4915.50]  It looks like that will not be the case.
[4916.64 --> 4921.54]  Space Gray will remain light in contrast with the Space Gray Apple Watch, which is darker.
[4922.64 --> 4925.30]  It's amazing the kinds of things that Apple people care about.
[4925.76 --> 4929.52]  Same connectors are, is rumored.
[4929.52 --> 4934.48]  So we might still be looking at a lightning connector as opposed to a USB Type-C connector.
[4935.26 --> 4937.00]  But this is a leak.
[4937.76 --> 4938.82]  None of it could be real.
[4939.54 --> 4943.38]  So, yeah, head to 9to5Mac if you're interested in learning more about it.
[4943.42 --> 4947.76]  Otherwise, I guess we could move on to not Apple things.
[4948.28 --> 4948.56]  Whoa.
[4948.56 --> 4950.60]  There's been a bunch of Reddit drama.
[4951.56 --> 4953.04]  Like, super-uper Reddit drama.
[4954.54 --> 4960.50]  Basically, like, the exodus seems to be kind of starting between the...
[4960.50 --> 4961.04]  Finally!
[4961.28 --> 4963.44]  Because they freaked out last time, and then were like,
[4963.56 --> 4965.02]  oh, I guess we'll just keep using Reddit.
[4965.22 --> 4966.88]  You know what's one funky town thing, though?
[4967.02 --> 4967.24]  Yeah.
[4967.44 --> 4969.66]  Everyone is talking about leaving Reddit on Reddit.
[4969.66 --> 4975.16]  Like, I guarantee you, Reddit has a huge traffic spike right now.
[4976.20 --> 4976.56]  Yeah.
[4976.70 --> 4980.34]  I was talking to someone about this earlier today, and it's just, like, guys.
[4981.74 --> 4982.12]  Man.
[4982.34 --> 4985.04]  Like, the AMA request for whatever the heck her name is,
[4985.14 --> 4986.36]  the chick that's running Reddit now,
[4986.68 --> 4990.74]  is, like, one of the most upvoted things, like, ever.
[4992.96 --> 4995.66]  If you want to protest, just actually leave.
[4995.66 --> 4999.78]  Basically, a mod was unexpectedly let go from her position with Reddit.
[5001.46 --> 5003.06]  Some mods were not notified.
[5003.58 --> 5006.48]  The admins didn't realize how important she was.
[5006.90 --> 5007.70]  Something, something.
[5008.16 --> 5008.68]  No one knows.
[5008.70 --> 5009.76]  Was made public again later.
[5009.76 --> 5013.40]  As far as I know, no one knows specifically how or why she got fired.
[5013.70 --> 5013.94]  Yep.
[5014.14 --> 5016.14]  There's already been job offers for her.
[5016.90 --> 5020.12]  Mods have been increasingly upset over the admins not keeping them
[5020.12 --> 5022.52]  or the users in the loop as much as they believe they should.
[5022.72 --> 5025.00]  They hope to get a better relationship with the admins.
[5025.00 --> 5026.02]  It was an admin.
[5026.42 --> 5026.68]  Yeah.
[5026.80 --> 5027.36]  Sorry, excuse me.
[5027.36 --> 5030.48]  It was an admin who did a lot for the AMA.
[5030.66 --> 5030.82]  Yeah.
[5031.32 --> 5032.74]  So, there you go.
[5032.86 --> 5035.60]  Some subreddits shut down so no one could comment on them.
[5036.50 --> 5041.96]  Notably, r slash funny, books, science, music, gaming, history, art, jokes,
[5042.46 --> 5043.88]  documentaries, today I learned.
[5043.88 --> 5047.54]  So, like, some, like, Reddits that even I've heard of as not a Redditor
[5047.54 --> 5050.80]  and, like, that I've browsed as not particularly a Redditor.
[5050.80 --> 5053.92]  So, uh, there you go.
[5054.04 --> 5055.82]  The rebels are, the rebels are rising.
[5056.78 --> 5057.74]  Or rousing.
[5058.04 --> 5058.42]  Rebel rousing.
[5058.42 --> 5061.12]  Hopefully, hopefully they remember for more than, like, four days.
[5061.66 --> 5062.74]  It's Reddit, so I don't know.
[5063.58 --> 5065.56]  I don't even remember what the last thing was.
[5065.62 --> 5068.00]  I think they, like, closed down some subreddits or something.
[5068.62 --> 5072.94]  And, like, Reddit exploded for, like, 24 hours.
[5073.42 --> 5075.32]  And then no one gave a crap.
[5076.94 --> 5077.34]  Okay.
[5077.56 --> 5080.46]  I mean, it's not, like, I don't think it's specific to Reddit.
[5080.58 --> 5082.76]  I think it's just any mainstream site.
[5083.06 --> 5083.18]  Yeah.
[5083.28 --> 5086.48]  A very mainstream site is going to have your very mainstream user
[5086.48 --> 5089.50]  who is not the emotionally invested user.
[5089.50 --> 5092.58]  So, like, once something reaches that critical mass,
[5093.08 --> 5097.82]  it takes, it has a lot of momentum.
[5098.20 --> 5100.42]  I mean, that's what critical mass means.
[5100.42 --> 5103.38]  It's, uh, so once you reach that critical mass,
[5103.44 --> 5104.26]  you gain a lot of momentum.
[5104.26 --> 5107.64]  And even if you lose some really important, like,
[5107.72 --> 5109.36]  keystone pieces of a community,
[5109.76 --> 5112.34]  it can keep a lot of momentum for a long time.
[5112.64 --> 5114.54]  You can potentially have a huge amount of mass without momentum.
[5115.92 --> 5117.22]  Yes, if you weren't moving.
[5118.22 --> 5118.86]  Thank you.
[5119.78 --> 5122.50]  But that's not what people mean when they say reaching critical mass.
[5122.50 --> 5125.56]  So I think you understood me fully and are just being a jackass.
[5127.14 --> 5130.30]  And on that note, thank you for tuning into the WAN show today.
[5130.42 --> 5133.22]  Thank you to our sponsors, SquarespaceandLinda.com.
[5133.38 --> 5138.06]  And we appreciate all 6,000 of you tuning in on this absolutely beautiful day
[5138.06 --> 5140.98]  when I'm sure many of you would rather be out riding a bicycle
[5140.98 --> 5143.34]  or whatever else it is that people do when it's sunny out.
[5143.42 --> 5144.14]  I wouldn't know.
[5144.38 --> 5145.18]  I'm sweating indoors.
[5145.46 --> 5147.68]  Thanks again for tuning in, and we'll see you guys again next week.
[5147.76 --> 5149.36]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[5149.92 --> 5150.20]  Yay.
[5150.32 --> 5150.70]  Outro!
[5150.94 --> 5151.20]  Right.
[5151.20 --> 5152.20]  Thank you.
[5154.02 --> 5154.90]  Didn't work.
[5155.56 --> 5156.18]  Hold on.
[5156.18 --> 5161.60]  Hold on.
[5161.60 --> 5161.88]  Hold on.
[5161.94 --> 5162.40]  I got this.
[5164.54 --> 5167.10]  Everybody wants a fire pole.
[5167.86 --> 5172.20]  Everybody wants a fire pole.
[5175.70 --> 5177.90]  Some people ask you to do a free of luck.
[5178.86 --> 5180.10]  I hope they need a shot ball.
[5181.38 --> 5182.30]  Fire pole!
[5182.30 --> 5184.74]  Fire pole!
[5184.74 --> 5184.78]  Fire pole!
[5184.78 --> 5185.28]  Fire pole!
[5185.28 --> 5185.98]  Fire pole!
[5186.22 --> 5188.84]  You can make a website about fire poles,
[5189.02 --> 5191.10]  and you can learn how to do that on Linda,
[5191.30 --> 5193.50]  and then you can take those skills to Squarespace,
[5194.42 --> 5195.52]  uh, Squarespace,
[5195.86 --> 5198.92]  and then you can learn how to end the broadcast by working here.
