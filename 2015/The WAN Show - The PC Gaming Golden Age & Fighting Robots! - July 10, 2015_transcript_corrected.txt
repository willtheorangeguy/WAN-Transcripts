[0.00 → 7.42] Show. I just had to, I had the stupidest, can you not? What are you even doing? I'm excited.
[7.72 → 14.84] Oh, are you excited about the video we just made? Yeah. Is that what you were gonna, uh,
[14.94 → 20.24] tease right there? No. Get it? Get it? Oh, there's, there's all the there's all the
[20.24 → 27.40] sea teasing that, uh, could be teasing. Oh, that's so good. Yeah. Sea teasing, man. No one's
[27.40 → 30.86] going to get that for a little while. Yeah, but they'll get it. Channel's super fun, man.
[31.00 → 36.72] It is going to have quite a video on it in a little while here, and you guys are gonna, you guys
[36.72 → 45.52] are going to like it, if you know what I mean. Um. They'll like the finish. No, what I am upset
[45.52 → 52.40] about is my stupid laptop that, we had a new person start today, so I actually had to give
[52.40 → 57.84] up my desk. I no longer have a desk in the editing den. All five of them are consumed
[57.84 → 64.78] by shooter slash editor people. Um, so I was like, okay, well, that's fine, I'll just use
[64.78 → 70.96] my laptop. And so I went downstairs, I set up a table for myself, and I like started working
[70.96 → 75.44] on something, and I was like, oh, I have to reboot. And I rebooted, and boom, Windows installation
[75.44 → 80.54] corrupted. So I went from having two usable computers at the office to having zero in a span
[80.54 → 88.24] of like six minutes. Um, so I actually had to re-reformat my computer before the show today.
[88.48 → 93.90] Holy crap. And so I'm not, okay, so the final, like, where I'm trying to get to with this story
[93.90 → 98.88] is I'm not logged into Twitch, and I can't see the Twitch chat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah.
[98.88 → 103.12] When did all that happen? Because you've already, obviously, nine-litre this and installed,
[103.24 → 107.96] like, Office and stuff. Uh, yeah, it happened like two hours ago. It was before we shot that
[107.96 → 114.90] thing with the, um, with the, um, okay, so Channel Super Fun. Should we say what it involves?
[115.16 → 122.98] Let's say what it involves. Dildos. There is a Channel Super Fun that involved unconventional
[122.98 → 128.42] use of dildos. Okay? A few of them, too. So get subscribed. Get subscribed, because it's
[128.42 → 132.62] going to be awesome. It is. All right, let's, uh, what have we got for topics today? Uh, Samsung
[132.62 → 137.96] and Opp sued over bloatware in China. That's good. Everyone should get sued over bloatware.
[137.96 → 141.96] Okay, not everyone should get sued over bloatware. Most people. Download the Linus Tech Tips app.
[142.04 → 146.64] Comes complete with McAfee and Ask Jeeves toolbar. We don't have one. No, we don't. Well, we do
[146.64 → 151.90] have one, but we don't have one. Don't, no, don't. Ignore it altogether. Yes. Uh, Logitech
[151.90 → 157.06] changed its name to Logic, sort of. Kind of, maybe a little bit. We'll talk about that later.
[157.06 → 164.32] 7 nanometre chip prototype by IBM. Ooh. Also, Ellen Pau, the interim CEO of Reddit, has mutually
[164.32 → 171.28] resigned. Mutually resigned. Has been mutually pushed out the door. Mutually, fatuously.
[172.28 → 173.48] She pushed backwards.
[173.48 → 173.50] She pushed backwards.
[187.06 → 201.58] she pushed backwards. She pushed backwards. It's Lindy.com. Yeah. And also, Lindy.com.
[201.58 → 209.70] Wooloo. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Hello. You know, my throat is actually sore from filming that video.
[209.70 → 217.60] it really is but mine's not you'll understand why and it
[217.60 → 224.48] it's okay it's not related to dildos, but it's definitely related to penises
[224.48 → 232.40] and that will make more sense when you watch the video wow um so Samsung and opp sued over
[232.40 → 238.48] bloatware in China the original poster here is captain gas and I'm going to go ahead and pull up
[238.48 → 247.18] the original article here from android authority just to be clear my throat is also sore but not
[247.18 → 257.22] actually from that video oh wow okay so uh all right, so the lawsuit came about following numerous
[257.22 → 263.46] consumer complaints about unwanted apps, so the case is actually the first of its kind filed by
[263.46 → 271.60] consumer rights commission to be accepted by a Shanghai court so the Galaxy Note 3 has 44
[271.60 → 280.88] pre-installed apps in the Chinese market and the opp find 7a has 71 pre-installed apps by default now we
[280.88 → 287.28] get it the business model behind pre-installed apps is that you get a kickback from the app maker
[287.28 → 294.44] because they can in theory monetize somehow or it's just keeping people within your locked tight
[294.44 → 301.72] ecosystem yes so okay when it's a third party pre-installed app it's all about um monetizing
[301.72 → 307.70] it somehow so you're taking your user base, and you're monetizing it allowing those app makers to
[307.70 → 311.78] have that as their user base which they can then monetize whether it's through microtransactions in a
[311.78 → 317.88] game or whether it's through uh selling personal details whether it's anonymously or like the more
[317.88 → 323.44] nefarious kind where it's actually tied to the actual individual and then what Luke was saying too was
[323.44 → 331.46] when it's more like Samsung's or opp's own like first party apps how many parties are there okay well
[331.46 → 337.46] whatever Samsung's own apps installed well it's that's just a clever way of trying to present a
[337.46 → 342.62] better value to the consumer um to get them locked into that platform because maybe say they like
[342.62 → 347.12] Samsung's mail app and then if you go to buy a phone in the future you can be like well it doesn't
[347.12 → 351.42] have all those things that I used all the time, and then you'll want the same phone which is fine if
[351.42 → 358.90] you can remove them but um yeah that's not always necessarily the case, so the problem is that neither
[358.90 → 364.12] company informed consumers about the number of apps pre-installed on the handsets and the consumers
[364.12 → 369.80] are not offered any information on how to uninstall those that they don't want so the smartphone
[369.80 → 374.98] companies have 15 days to enter a defence after which a trial date will be announced it's really
[374.98 → 383.06] interesting to me that pre-installed apps have now turned into a potentially legal issue for the
[383.06 → 387.24] companies that are putting them on because which is cool this is something that we've been dealing with
[387.24 → 397.74] since like you know buying a gateway with an AOL crap on it and like Norton 360 wild tangent games you have to use the
[397.74 → 406.12] Norton removal tool to take it off because it's so parasitic ever have you ever played a wild tangent game no but I've
[406.12 → 414.08] removed it off of so many computers hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them that's right you worked for geek squad and a few
[414.08 → 420.88] other places so you really have I actually have yes and like the Norton removal I had a script and an USB
[420.88 → 427.24] and it was one of those uh what was it the u2 whatever uses that had auto whatever that people
[427.24 → 432.32] used for hacking all the time but I used the auto thing to launch a script which would just run through
[432.32 → 437.08] remove wild tangent game it would remove all the ones that were on everything right so it would remove
[437.08 → 442.44] wild tangent games uh it would run the Norton removal tool it would do all this stuff and just nuke all the
[442.44 → 448.14] things right at the beginning just be like screw this computer screw that computer whatever get out
[448.14 → 454.68] here I don't want your crap anyone cares about your stupid game that is a freak I wonder what wild
[454.68 → 462.64] tangent is doing now I don't I'm going to google this because I haven't heard of them in a really long time
[462.64 → 472.66] no, no no, no they oh they're still they're owned by hp wild tangent games for hp uh what no because Asus
[472.66 → 480.06] had it Asus had wild tangent stuff pre-installed on a laptop recently Redmond Washington based game
[480.06 → 484.30] network privately held in the United States that power game services for several pc manufacturers
[484.30 → 490.08] including dell no, no they're their own thing I think that one maybe it's just because we're looking at
[490.08 → 497.20] wild tangent.ca and like maybe in this territory wild tangent is partnered with hp in some strategic
[497.20 → 505.56] way or something, but it's just like you know maybe we're being too hard on wild tangent I have
[505.56 → 512.00] never played one of their games is it possible it looks like they have like DS games and stuff what
[512.00 → 518.94] is it possible that their games are no more offensive than space pinball I like space and this is not a
[518.94 → 523.70] sponsorship integration for wild tangent it really wouldn't be based on how much we've talked about
[523.70 → 528.04] how we yeah I don't I don't think anyone's worried about yeah I'm just I'm just making sure it's very
[528.04 → 535.04] clear I mean what is what is open a boutique sugar games shut up its ten dollars are you for
[535.04 → 540.78] oh my god so wait is their monetization platform trying to get people to buy the games
[540.78 → 546.54] I've honestly never launched the app I've just yeah does it come with demos maybe the twitch chat knows
[546.54 → 552.98] twitch chat seems to know all kinds of things sometimes buy a fire pool wild tangent comes with
[552.98 → 561.20] every hp purchase Luke fire pool space pinball rules yes indeed why doesn't steam come pre-installed
[561.20 → 566.78] instead of wild tangent great question fantastic you can get steam using nine night.com yeah
[566.78 → 574.06] nine night.com is basically the equivalent of like WinRAR chrome steam FileZilla I love how we have
[574.06 → 579.88] twitch staff paint.net stream consistently you're awesome yeah that's all I have to say
[579.88 → 588.04] uh so no one is saying that wild tangent really no one's talking I don't think anybody knows they
[588.04 → 593.46] just see it on the computer, and they remove it because it's garbage oh it would take up a lot of
[593.46 → 600.70] space sometimes I know it was huge I know especially back in the day when laptops had liked you know 80
[600.70 → 605.58] gig hard drives it's like you have the operating system and then wild tangent games, and you're just
[605.58 → 611.14] done it's like no you cannot take up a couple of hundred legs on an 80 gig hard drive if you're not
[611.14 → 618.00] something useful period yeah it's hilarious this really makes me this sends me back to like
[618.00 → 628.58] the day when like my parents first computer one of our hard drives was I oh shoot i it was
[628.58 → 636.36] something ridiculous we had a small one and a big one and if I recall correctly the big one was a hundred
[636.36 → 649.22] megabytes and I was just like great it could hold almost nothing it was awesome and like nowadays
[649.22 → 655.02] we've just reached the point like I think once we cracked the one terabyte capacity per drive
[655.02 → 661.12] combined with how so much of our storage is cloud-based which might not necessarily benefit
[661.12 → 666.66] you in terms of like okay I want to look at that picture I'm going to download it from my cloud account
[666.66 → 672.54] no, no not necessarily, although some people do use Facebook purely as a picture repository yep um no i
[672.54 → 678.12] mean cloud storage in the sense that or like cloud-based in the sense that like you don't have to have
[678.12 → 682.86] every game installed on your computer all the time because it's like a half an hour process of
[682.86 → 688.70] swapping in discs and like reinstalling it and looking at that stupid CD key where is it
[688.70 → 693.00] and that kind of nonsense you didn't have that that bad because you kept a database
[693.00 → 700.30] uh I did too yes, but there was quite I think I bought uh warcraft three times and then I was
[700.30 → 705.90] trying to like screw it I'm logging all this stuff yep star craft I bought more than once star craft one
[705.90 → 712.08] um you know I wonder if blizzard became such a big company because people had to rebuy their games so many
[712.08 → 712.74] damn times
[712.74 → 715.60] well you only needed the key
[715.60 → 717.88] by the star craft stage
[717.88 → 720.24] you actually only needed your key in fact
[720.24 → 725.16] my warcraft three discs was missing forever no my problem was losing the keys
[725.16 → 727.20] oh you would lose the keys' oh
[727.20 → 730.06] oh yeah no i I do have a key repository
[730.06 → 736.30] because I had i I immediately downloaded ISOs for those discs right I just needed the keys
[736.30 → 744.94] game copy world yes exactly I am not putting CDs in my computer that is stupid I paid for this software
[744.94 → 756.06] if I can't find my 1602 ad CD I am still going to trade like wool and cloth and fight pirates period
[756.06 → 762.06] that's going to happen game copy world was the best oh my god are they still around I don't again
[762.06 → 766.78] let's look up something old yeah I have I actually legitimately have no idea because that was like
[766.78 → 773.70] remember far cry yeah had five discs yeah and I was just oh my god it looks the same it still looks
[773.70 → 781.54] exactly the same that's hilarious wow oh that's awesome this is wonderful important notice
[781.54 → 785.70] wow this is so it looks that site
[785.70 → 788.54] looks so early 2000s
[788.54 → 791.28] what dragon age inquisition FIFA 2015
[791.28 → 792.88] dying light Witcher 3
[792.88 → 794.68] so they still have no CD patches
[794.68 → 795.54] they still run stuff
[795.54 → 799.54] I guess people some people still buy CDs of the game
[799.54 → 801.68] so they might actually have use for an OCD patch
[801.68 → 803.94] wow there it is guys
[803.94 → 805.62] game copy world
[805.62 → 808.00] got that Pac-Man logo
[808.00 → 809.92] this makes me feel so old school
[809.92 → 811.38] because they're advertising eve too
[811.38 → 812.22] right
[812.22 → 813.12] wow
[813.12 → 817.42] all right should we do any actual topics today
[817.42 → 818.90] oh man I mean yes
[818.90 → 824.54] the one plus two is going to have four gigs of LP ddr4 ram
[824.54 → 829.36] so the official statement why did we choose LP ddr4 for the one plus two
[829.36 → 831.84] lower power consumption and better battery efficiency
[831.84 → 835.88] twice the bed with performance as LP ddr3 at the same power
[835.88 → 836.96] didn't see that one coming
[836.96 → 838.62] lower operating voltage than its predecessor
[838.62 → 840.90] I didn't see that one coming
[840.90 → 842.96] from 1.2 volts to 1.1 volts
[842.96 → 846.28] speeds of up to 32 gigabytes per second
[846.28 → 848.48] it is twice as fast as LP ddr3
[848.48 → 850.30] that's actually the same as the second point
[850.30 → 852.88] which was twice the bandwidth performance
[852.88 → 853.72] yeah
[853.72 → 857.38] uh it also happens to be the only type of ram to run on the snapdragon 810
[857.38 → 857.88] it's interesting
[857.88 → 859.54] literally the only one they could have used
[859.54 → 866.36] it's interesting it is interesting to me that the snapdragon 810 was the choice
[866.36 → 872.00] I mean even though like okay you know about like the whole thing going on with snapdragon 810
[872.00 → 872.54] no
[872.54 → 876.32] so basically it is thermal throttles like a bitch in pretty much every phone
[876.32 → 881.48] um now with that said the one plus two should be pretty big
[881.48 → 885.18] and if they decide to build in a pretty beefy thermal solution
[885.18 → 887.74] they might have fewer problems than with it than others have
[887.74 → 889.68] but LG in the g4
[889.68 → 892.96] my video of which is up on vessel but not YouTube yet I think so
[892.96 → 894.52] some of you may have seen it already
[894.52 → 896.04] on the g4
[896.04 → 896.96] um
[896.96 → 900.60] I was surprised having done zero research on the g4
[900.60 → 901.86] until I was holding it in my hand
[901.86 → 902.54] because I'm not
[902.54 → 904.80] like I'm not an obsessive phone guy
[904.80 → 907.74] but like I've spent enough time with enough phones
[907.74 → 912.32] I have absolutely no problems reviewing them it's just that I'm not I'm not I'm not reading
[912.32 → 913.00] rumour sites
[913.00 → 915.32] so when it arrives I'm like okay
[915.32 → 918.42] and I was like oh this has a snapdragon 808 in it
[918.42 → 923.92] so that's actually four low power cores and only two high performance cores versus the four high
[923.92 → 928.22] performance cores in the 810 not to mention that it has no support for lpddr4
[928.22 → 932.94] and I was like this is a flagship phone this is a 600 phone are you guys for real
[932.94 → 943.08] and it was fascinating because android authority did a great article where they had the uh the g4 and the flex 2
[943.08 → 950.48] which are similar to both current generation flagship class phones one of which runs the 810
[950.48 → 956.22] the flex 2 and one of which runs the lower end cheaper actually 808
[956.22 → 962.70] and they discovered that the flex 2, and they could only really say flex 2 because
[962.70 → 967.42] you can't say oh the 810 throttles more than the 808 because we're just looking at two individual phones
[967.42 → 968.22] three thermal profiles
[968.22 → 971.56] but the flex 2 throttled like crazy
[971.56 → 977.48] whereas the g4 took I think it was something in the neighbourhood of six minutes to start really thermally throttling
[977.48 → 981.10] meaning that you're actually unless you're doing something heavily multithreaded
[981.10 → 983.12] which lets face it doesn't happen that often on a phone
[983.12 → 988.22] like if you're encoding video on your phone which yeah you might do once in a while
[988.22 → 991.18] I've done that twice yeah I've done it a couple of times but like
[991.18 → 997.20] you know um so if you're doing anything that's not heavily multithreaded you could actually be better off with an 808
[997.20 → 1002.92] so uh anyway the one plus two will not have that it'll have an 810, and it'll have four gigs of lpddr4
[1002.92 → 1007.50] because it has to is is is phone memory getting out of hand like is that
[1007.50 → 1011.04] that's got to be a straw poll guys straw
[1011.04 → 1016.08] phone storage we should get straw poll as a sponsor
[1016.08 → 1019.08] we're always using it I love that site
[1019.08 → 1022.04] do they even probably a huge percentage of their bandwidth
[1022.04 → 1023.40] do they even advertise
[1023.40 → 1025.72] straw poll yeah probably not
[1025.72 → 1027.90] I don't even know it's just this dude
[1027.90 → 1029.56] what is their monetization model
[1029.56 → 1031.30] like its app created by dander
[1031.30 → 1033.92] it's not a difficult thing
[1033.92 → 1035.08] yeah I guess that's
[1035.08 → 1036.26] we could just make our own
[1036.26 → 1037.08] I guess we could
[1037.08 → 1038.70] if we really wanted to
[1038.70 → 1039.44] I don't want to
[1039.44 → 1039.74] no
[1039.74 → 1040.28] yeah
[1040.28 → 1041.22] um
[1041.22 → 1045.56] I think that's the reason why we use it is that it's easy and everything else
[1045.56 → 1049.00] might exist, but there's no point looking for it because this one exists
[1049.00 → 1050.82] turnip
[1050.82 → 1052.10] all right
[1052.10 → 1056.58] now I know a lot of you have bought the shirt
[1056.58 → 1064.42] but I would like you to resist the urge to vote for turnip this time for those of you who don't know about this
[1064.42 → 1066.42] wow
[1066.42 → 1067.26] and it's winning
[1067.26 → 1074.76] we're going to have a moment of silence to appreciate your disrespect
[1074.76 → 1078.10] it's winning by so much
[1078.10 → 1079.64] Luke you're a lot of things to me okay
[1079.64 → 1081.02] you're an employee
[1081.02 → 1082.70] you're a friend
[1082.70 → 1084.18] you're a fellow dildo racer
[1084.18 → 1085.76] you're a fellow dildo racer
[1085.76 → 1088.24] yeah
[1088.24 → 1089.84] you're a colleague
[1089.84 → 1091.16] you know you're
[1091.16 → 1094.44] and you just you can't respect me enough
[1094.44 → 1095.76] to not vote for turnip
[1095.76 → 1099.44] wrecked
[1099.44 → 1101.26] uh I can't
[1101.26 → 1102.42] oh my goodness
[1102.42 → 1103.98] shut up
[1103.98 → 1107.94] oh this tab needs to go away now
[1107.94 → 1110.06] it's like Norton security
[1110.06 → 1111.04] Shaw security
[1111.04 → 1112.00] we're everything secure
[1112.00 → 1113.96] oh my god I have a touchpad
[1113.96 → 1117.44] I can't close the dialogue and hit the exit fast enough
[1117.44 → 1118.18] but Linus
[1118.18 → 1119.22] this action's required
[1119.22 → 1120.48] there were threats detected
[1120.48 → 1121.24] like
[1121.24 → 1122.88] your Norton security key ran out
[1122.88 → 1124.00] so you need to buy one
[1124.00 → 1125.10] that's a threat
[1125.10 → 1128.84] jeez
[1128.84 → 1131.00] may I offer you a Norton removal tool
[1131.00 → 1132.46] for those of you who aren't aware
[1132.46 → 1136.52] we actually have a vote for turnip shirt coming out
[1136.52 → 1138.04] I haven't bought one of these yet
[1138.04 → 1138.90] i have to get on that
[1138.90 → 1141.96] we're not expecting this to be like the most popular shirt we've ever done
[1141.96 → 1144.62] because it's basically just an inside joke
[1144.62 → 1146.16] for the wan show viewers
[1146.16 → 1149.68] who are not even I don't think the majority of our viewers
[1149.68 → 1150.32] it's just
[1150.32 → 1150.80] no
[1150.80 → 1152.38] you guys who watch wan show
[1152.38 → 1155.68] uh because we don't we don't refer to turnips anywhere else
[1155.68 → 1156.30] nope
[1156.30 → 1157.42] so I think a lot of people
[1157.42 → 1158.20] when I'm like
[1158.20 → 1159.04] what the hell is this
[1159.04 → 1160.46] the thing with the body paint
[1160.46 → 1161.56] is that out yet
[1161.56 → 1162.24] I'm not yet
[1162.24 → 1164.64] a lot of people are going to be super-duper confused
[1164.64 → 1166.78] I think everyone's going to be a little confused
[1166.78 → 1167.40] yeah
[1167.40 → 1170.68] but we are finally doing that um
[1170.68 → 1174.66] that that new office crowdfunding campaign
[1174.66 → 1175.16] thing
[1175.16 → 1178.52] where we committed to me wearing body paint in a video
[1178.52 → 1179.56] I think that's the last
[1179.56 → 1180.62] second last one
[1180.62 → 1181.44] second last one
[1181.44 → 1182.28] there's one more
[1182.28 → 1183.10] you know what
[1183.10 → 1188.60] I don't think I've received your uh Daniel Radcliffe Harry Potter
[1188.60 → 1189.88] I'm actually so stoked for that
[1189.88 → 1191.38] what I do have though
[1191.38 → 1194.00] is I have the chalkboard sticker
[1194.00 → 1194.72] oh cool
[1194.72 → 1195.62] of the speech bubble
[1195.62 → 1195.98] yeah
[1195.98 → 1197.80] so we can actually say whatever we want
[1197.80 → 1201.66] it's going to start with wingardium get the f back to work Luke
[1201.66 → 1202.34] but then it can
[1202.34 → 1203.34] but we could change it
[1203.34 → 1203.82] that's cool
[1203.82 → 1205.26] he could cast all kinds of spells
[1205.26 → 1208.64] we should have that
[1208.64 → 1209.88] Vatican stop slacking
[1209.88 → 1213.48] that would kill me
[1213.48 → 1215.16] but not
[1215.16 → 1216.16] but um
[1216.16 → 1217.52] tell me this
[1217.52 → 1219.38] when you're slacking
[1219.38 → 1223.02] can you really tell the difference between slacking Luke and dead Luke
[1223.02 → 1223.88] wow
[1223.88 → 1225.38] wow
[1225.38 → 1226.42] is there resurrection
[1226.42 → 1227.16] there is
[1227.16 → 1227.64] but you can
[1227.64 → 1229.52] when you get resurrected in the Harry Potter universe
[1229.52 → 1230.18] you don't really
[1230.18 → 1231.46] like have your soul
[1231.46 → 1233.32] you know you live in a picture frame I think
[1233.32 → 1234.50] no, no no
[1234.50 → 1235.46] that's not resurrection
[1235.46 → 1238.38] oh you're talking about a hor crux
[1238.38 → 1240.22] no you have to split your soul
[1240.22 → 1241.68] prior to dying
[1241.68 → 1243.82] so your soul is still alive
[1243.82 → 1244.60] in like
[1244.60 → 1245.18] you know
[1245.18 → 1246.74] someone's dildo or something
[1246.74 → 1247.20] no because one of the three
[1247.20 → 1248.50] there 's's the wand
[1248.50 → 1248.98] soul dildo
[1248.98 → 1249.30] there's
[1249.30 → 1252.90] there's the wand
[1252.90 → 1253.52] there's the cape
[1253.52 → 1254.58] and there's something else in there
[1254.58 → 1255.18] and the third one
[1255.18 → 1256.12] the deathly hallows
[1256.12 → 1256.38] yeah
[1256.38 → 1258.04] doesn't that one bring someone back to life
[1258.04 → 1259.12] and doesn't someone do it
[1259.12 → 1260.22] and then the person is like
[1260.22 → 1261.76] oh
[1261.76 → 1262.54] not the same
[1262.54 → 1262.88] oh I don't remember
[1262.88 → 1264.90] it's been a while
[1264.90 → 1265.36] I'm not
[1265.36 → 1267.28] I'm not up on my Harry Potter stuff
[1267.28 → 1269.54] it's been a long time
[1269.54 → 1270.46] I loved those books
[1270.46 → 1271.16] but it's been a long time
[1271.16 → 1272.18] does anyone remember
[1272.18 → 1273.38] uh
[1273.38 → 1274.88] I don't know
[1274.88 → 1276.32] everyone's just talking about dildos
[1276.32 → 1277.84] yeah everyone's just talking about dildos
[1277.84 → 1278.42] in twitch chat
[1278.42 → 1279.12] yeah dildo
[1279.12 → 1280.18] um
[1280.18 → 1281.66] what were we even talking about
[1281.66 → 1282.50] someone should make
[1282.50 → 1282.84] right
[1282.84 → 1284.18] after reading gig dildo
[1284.18 → 1285.20] someone should make like
[1285.20 → 1286.38] gun dam wing inspired
[1286.38 → 1288.66] inspired dildos
[1288.66 → 1288.94] yeah
[1288.94 → 1291.48] that sounds extraordinarily uncomfortable
[1291.48 → 1293.08] well you could make it
[1293.08 → 1294.74] or you could just have like a dildo collection
[1294.74 → 1296.46] you wouldn't actually have to use them I guess
[1296.46 → 1297.32] that's true
[1297.32 → 1299.46] like if you were like a dildo aficionado
[1299.46 → 1300.28] I'm sure someone would use it
[1300.28 → 1302.30] I'm sure someone has a dildo collection too
[1302.30 → 1304.56] I'm sure tons of people have dildo collections
[1304.56 → 1305.48] well no but I mean like
[1305.48 → 1306.34] just a collection
[1306.34 → 1307.26] like on display
[1307.26 → 1309.38] oh with like zero intent of using
[1309.38 → 1309.64] yeah
[1309.64 → 1311.10] yeah I'm sure someone out there
[1311.10 → 1312.08] just collects dildos
[1312.08 → 1312.72] yeah probably
[1312.72 → 1314.52] so has phone memory gotten out of hand
[1314.52 → 1315.86] we've got turnip running away
[1315.86 → 1317.44] with 42% of the vote
[1317.44 → 1319.16] 30% of you are saying go
[1319.16 → 1320.52] bring on the memory
[1320.52 → 1322.48] I'd love to have more RAM in my phone
[1322.48 → 1323.64] what I want to know is
[1323.64 → 1325.10] how many people
[1325.10 → 1326.94] even have Chrome on their phones
[1326.94 → 1328.62] why do they need so much memory
[1328.62 → 1330.44] just kidding
[1330.44 → 1331.40] sorry Chrome
[1331.40 → 1332.40] that was a cheap shot
[1332.40 → 1334.32] probably tons
[1334.32 → 1335.56] but how many people
[1335.56 → 1337.12] really have that much stuff
[1337.12 → 1338.58] open at a time on their phones
[1338.58 → 1339.84] to the point where
[1339.84 → 1341.56] you would actually run out of
[1341.56 → 1344.18] three or even two gigs of memory
[1344.18 → 1345.74] without getting to the point
[1345.74 → 1346.60] where you've got so much
[1346.60 → 1347.94] background crap running
[1347.94 → 1349.56] that it's draining your battery life
[1349.56 → 1350.24] to the point where you can
[1350.24 → 1351.38] like I have
[1351.38 → 1353.50] my phone use habits
[1353.50 → 1354.34] have actually
[1354.34 → 1356.16] overshot
[1356.16 → 1357.30] modern technology
[1357.30 → 1358.30] modern technology
[1358.82 → 1360.62] yeah I just tried to double tap this
[1360.62 → 1361.30] um
[1361.30 → 1363.02] my phone habits
[1363.02 → 1364.30] have overshot
[1364.30 → 1365.66] most
[1365.66 → 1367.42] modern flagship smartphones
[1367.42 → 1368.32] in terms of
[1368.32 → 1369.30] battery capacity
[1369.30 → 1371.16] because using the droid turbo
[1371.16 → 1373.22] has made me just take for granted
[1373.22 → 1373.96] that I can just
[1373.96 → 1375.44] do whatever I want on my phone
[1375.44 → 1376.28] and I'm going to have like
[1376.28 → 1376.90] 20%
[1376.90 → 1378.40] 15% left at the end of the day
[1378.40 → 1379.64] even when I use it really hard
[1379.64 → 1380.40] so
[1380.40 → 1382.06] the lgg4
[1382.06 → 1383.78] like I would make it
[1383.78 → 1385.38] but I had one really long day
[1385.38 → 1386.42] where i both got up early
[1386.42 → 1387.90] and I had to work really late
[1387.90 → 1389.96] when I didn't make it
[1389.96 → 1391.50] and using something like
[1391.50 → 1392.78] the s6 edge
[1392.78 → 1393.46] like
[1393.46 → 1394.76] really using it
[1394.76 → 1395.86] i almost
[1395.86 → 1397.46] i very rarely make it through the day
[1397.46 → 1398.52] today I'm going to make it
[1398.52 → 1400.26] and using the iPhone 6
[1400.26 → 1400.96] uh
[1400.96 → 1402.80] when I was doing my Apple Watch review
[1402.80 → 1404.46] was actually really tough
[1404.46 → 1405.30] because
[1405.30 → 1406.20] combining
[1406.20 → 1407.92] the fact that the iPhone 6's battery
[1407.92 → 1409.26] really isn't that great
[1409.26 → 1410.44] with the fact that
[1410.44 → 1410.98] all of a sudden
[1410.98 → 1412.52] now I've got Bluetooth on all the time
[1412.52 → 1414.06] because I've got it paired to a watch
[1414.06 → 1415.02] um
[1415.02 → 1417.02] I made it through I think
[1417.02 → 1419.20] I think the first two days in a row
[1419.20 → 1420.34] I didn't make it through the day
[1420.34 → 1422.46] I don't even want to keep using this
[1422.46 → 1424.34] there are huge problems with this thing
[1424.34 → 1425.70] I need to reformat it for one
[1425.70 → 1425.98] but
[1425.98 → 1427.90] I don't get notifications at all
[1427.90 → 1428.66] unless the screen is on
[1428.66 → 1429.78] which is why I need to reformat it
[1429.78 → 1430.08] right
[1430.08 → 1431.24] but there 's's other
[1431.24 → 1432.28] various reasons
[1432.28 → 1433.46] it's not really that big of a deal
[1433.46 → 1436.40] but the reason why I'm being so reluctant to give up on it
[1436.40 → 1438.64] is every other phone option that I have
[1438.64 → 1441.18] will make it through six hours of a day
[1441.18 → 1441.46] right
[1441.46 → 1442.98] yeah the z3 is not bad
[1442.98 → 1443.96] it's got like what a 3,000
[1443.96 → 1444.34] battery
[1444.34 → 1445.14] the battery light's pretty good
[1445.14 → 1445.44] yeah
[1445.44 → 1446.16] um
[1446.16 → 1448.72] g4 is another one that like I did okay with
[1448.72 → 1452.22] but I'm really excited right now about the s6 active
[1452.22 → 1454.22] yeah do you have that
[1454.22 → 1454.80] I do
[1454.80 → 1455.82] that looks super cool
[1455.82 → 1457.12] it's not on me right now
[1457.12 → 1457.90] but I'm
[1457.90 → 1461.68] I'm trying to pump out my Apple Watch review
[1461.68 → 1465.40] so that like I've still got a few more things I want to observe about it
[1465.40 → 1466.08] um
[1466.08 → 1467.18] so I'm trying to pump that out
[1467.18 → 1467.56] because
[1467.56 → 1470.46] I will be completely changing gears
[1470.46 → 1472.42] and I will be switching to the s6 active
[1472.42 → 1474.10] and the pebble time
[1474.10 → 1475.20] which also just arrived
[1475.20 → 1478.06] so I'll be going Apple ecosystem to
[1478.06 → 1480.56] android plus something else
[1480.56 → 1481.98] not in an ecosystem at all
[1481.98 → 1483.74] and having those two experiences back to back
[1483.74 → 1484.24] which is
[1484.24 → 1486.76] part of what I love about being a tech reviewer
[1486.76 → 1488.56] just trying these things
[1488.56 → 1489.54] it's really nice
[1489.54 → 1491.18] and I must admit
[1491.18 → 1492.22] and having
[1492.22 → 1493.02] having that
[1493.02 → 1494.10] getting that perspective
[1494.10 → 1495.18] because before
[1495.18 → 1496.24] um
[1496.24 → 1498.26] well also when I was a fair bit younger
[1498.26 → 1500.68] I succumbed much more to the
[1500.68 → 1501.14] uh
[1501.14 → 1502.42] I call this out all the time
[1502.42 → 1502.86] the just
[1502.86 → 1506.02] being angry about purchasing decisions
[1506.02 → 1508.00] while people online will just
[1508.00 → 1508.54] fight
[1508.54 → 1509.38] because they're like
[1509.38 → 1510.28] I bought this thing
[1510.28 → 1511.94] and I need to justify my purchase
[1511.94 → 1513.60] so screw you
[1513.60 → 1513.90] yeah
[1513.90 → 1515.48] that's where I see a lot of that
[1515.48 → 1516.58] fanboy wars
[1516.58 → 1517.46] yeah exactly
[1517.46 → 1518.18] um
[1518.18 → 1519.60] but being able to try everything
[1519.60 → 1520.38] you start to realize
[1520.38 → 1521.22] that there's
[1521.22 → 1522.58] usually pros and cons
[1522.58 → 1523.94] to literally everything
[1523.94 → 1525.48] and it's kind of just fine
[1525.48 → 1526.54] as long as it works for you
[1526.54 → 1527.46] it's very rare
[1527.46 → 1528.42] that we come up with something
[1528.42 → 1529.18] that is just
[1529.18 → 1530.94] unequivocally bad
[1530.94 → 1532.14] like just terrible
[1532.14 → 1533.80] and no one should buy it
[1533.80 → 1533.90] and
[1533.90 → 1534.70] like the core effects
[1534.70 → 1535.32] like the
[1535.32 → 1536.50] like the core effects
[1536.50 → 1537.50] uh
[1537.50 → 1538.04] well
[1538.04 → 1538.50] okay
[1538.50 → 1540.42] what we can say about the core effects
[1540.42 → 1541.48] is that it's early
[1541.48 → 1542.78] early days
[1542.78 → 1543.86] for that technology
[1543.86 → 1544.32] yeah
[1544.32 → 1545.34] and that
[1545.34 → 1547.14] you should just tape an Xbox controller to your chest
[1547.14 → 1547.88] and that
[1547.88 → 1548.74] and that
[1548.74 → 1549.52] um
[1549.52 → 1551.82] there is something to be said
[1551.82 → 1554.28] for more interactivity with games
[1554.28 → 1554.68] it's true
[1554.68 → 1555.46] it's just that
[1555.46 → 1556.66] that product
[1556.66 → 1558.14] isn't it
[1558.14 → 1558.88] no
[1558.88 → 1560.80] um
[1560.80 → 1561.10] oh
[1561.10 → 1562.46] you know the Arab
[1562.46 → 1564.02] or Arab or whatever it is
[1564.02 → 1564.26] sorry
[1564.26 → 1565.36] it's okay
[1565.36 → 1566.46] the Arab though
[1566.46 → 1567.40] yeah
[1567.40 → 1568.40] we might be able to get a sample
[1568.40 → 1568.80] okay
[1568.80 → 1569.60] that's cool
[1569.60 → 1570.04] yeah
[1570.04 → 1570.46] yeah
[1570.46 → 1571.12] um
[1571.12 → 1573.92] I still I'm very interested in force feedback vests
[1573.92 → 1574.26] yeah
[1574.26 → 1574.62] just
[1574.62 → 1576.46] the core effects was just not good
[1576.46 → 1579.40] yeah you've been doing like all the like weird stuff lately
[1579.40 → 1580.80] like that 3d scanner
[1580.80 → 1582.00] the core effects' thing
[1582.00 → 1582.74] it might
[1582.74 → 1585.56] is it even refreshing to go back and do a keyboard for a change
[1585.56 → 1587.66] it's honestly uh
[1587.66 → 1588.92] I've been looking at it and like
[1588.92 → 1590.38] this is going to sound a little bit bad
[1590.38 → 1591.08] because i
[1591.08 → 1592.34] especially when I first started
[1592.34 → 1593.68] I was like all about keyboards
[1593.68 → 1594.20] yeah
[1594.20 → 1596.16] there haven't been a lot of major changes
[1596.16 → 1598.66] the MX board 6.0
[1598.66 → 1599.28] is that what it's called
[1599.28 → 1599.52] yeah
[1599.52 → 1600.72] MX board 6.0
[1600.72 → 1605.90] does have a completely redesigned actual electronic electrical structure
[1605.90 → 1606.50] it does
[1606.50 → 1607.00] it does
[1607.00 → 1608.04] but I need to do
[1608.04 → 1610.40] I need to do some testing to see if there's
[1610.40 → 1610.64] the wave of the future
[1610.64 → 1612.22] a noticeable difference
[1612.22 → 1613.18] tell me this
[1613.18 → 1614.24] I also want to give it to ed
[1614.24 → 1615.40] yeah
[1615.40 → 1617.34] and see if he feels a difference
[1617.34 → 1619.58] because ed's like this crazy counterstrike player
[1619.58 → 1623.20] so like if he notices like tiny amounts of difference then that's super
[1623.20 → 1626.36] my understanding is he's actually pretty good but I've never played with him
[1626.36 → 1627.32] I've never played with him either
[1627.32 → 1628.10] oh okay
[1628.10 → 1630.26] but like he super knows what he's talking about
[1630.26 → 1631.56] yeah he claims his rank is good
[1631.56 → 1636.40] and he uploaded some footage in one of our reviews where he seemed to be pwning dudes or something
[1636.40 → 1638.12] so I'm like okay sure yeah that's cool
[1638.12 → 1638.38] yeah
[1638.38 → 1640.56] um speaking of pwning dudes
[1640.56 → 1650.04] Ea will pay a 60 million dollar fine for the unauthorized use of names and portraits of athletes
[1650.04 → 1650.84] oh rest
[1650.84 → 1652.42] so let's go ahead and
[1652.42 → 1653.02] now
[1653.02 → 1661.52] uh yeah original link here is from game shock now I'm going to go ahead I'm an I'm an I'm a leap all over this and say
[1661.52 → 1673.22] uh this is not even the like the the the crowning head of the tip of the iceberg that is the injustice of um
[1673.22 → 1680.08] what do we even call it we can't call it professional athletics in the United States because they aren't getting paid
[1680.08 → 1703.20] um so but someone's getting paid it just isn't the athlete so the whole system down there where you're trading experience for uh someone else makes a ton of money like basically you're it's like it's like asking people to buy lotto tickets kind of thing you're like you're taking their money for them to have a chance to win big and make it
[1703.22 → 1717.12] to the NFL or the NBA, and we're giving them nothing in return but the opportunity to do that what are you talking about you know that college athletes don't get paid right this is NBA this is NBA isn't it no
[1717.12 → 1724.88] uh so American football and men's blah blah blah yeah, so those affected our current and former college athletes
[1724.88 → 1730.86] oh it says here names and likenesses in Ea games such as madden and NBA live
[1730.86 → 1744.22] so it's currently awaiting final approval from an U.S. district judge um claims have been made against the NCAA Ea and collegiate licensing company the nation's leading collegiate trademark licensing and marketing firm
[1744.22 → 1756.86] so about 16 percent of eligible athletes for the 40 million settlement including Ea and the CLC have filed claims 24 percent of the eligible athletes for the 20 million dollar settlement against the NCAA have filed
[1756.86 → 1765.98] filed so I mean it's its kind of pitiful um the athletes will get most will get a thousand bucks in compensation
[1765.98 → 1775.92] and some will get uh 6700 or more or at all athletes who made a valid claim will receive at least 74 dollars
[1775.92 → 1785.28] and that's that's pretty uh that's pretty that's pretty shameful the whole situation is really gross
[1785.28 → 1791.66] and hideous I don't madden and some NBA games have college teams or draft boards you can use
[1791.66 → 1801.84] so there you go uh nick light to the rescue, but the point is that it's yeah it's maybe a step in the right direction
[1801.84 → 1811.88] I mean acknowledging that these people should be paid for whatever like the fact that they have enough notoriety
[1811.88 → 1818.76] that someone wants to use their picture and include them in a video game should be worth something you can't just be like
[1818.76 → 1827.22] sorry kid you know uh that's that's tough the way that worked out for you but hey at least you got a shot to make it to the big time
[1827.22 → 1834.62] i mean you can, and you know the thing is like there's all these arguments for this you know
[1834.62 → 1839.44] like i I like you can make the argument well the kids knew what they were getting themselves into
[1839.44 → 1845.12] they knew they weren't going to be paid you know what bullshit because yeah they knew it but
[1845.12 → 1853.20] let's face it you know people going into the system aren't really given a choice even if they even is
[1853.20 → 1857.00] they know it and a lot of the time people that sold themselves into slavery knew that they were
[1857.00 → 1863.10] selling themselves into slavery yep uh I mean, and you know getting into like speaking of injustices
[1863.10 → 1868.02] you know Native Americans here and I don't remember what the new politically correct term is i frankly i
[1868.02 → 1874.86] don't care first nations Native Americans whatever it is the people who were here already sold their land
[1874.86 → 1882.98] a lot of them not all and so did they understand the terms of the contract probably not
[1882.98 → 1890.64] was that taking advantage of a situation probably um I'm not I'm not a legal court and I'm not really
[1890.64 → 1895.30] going to get into a lot of depth with that, but the point is just because someone agrees to
[1895.30 → 1901.34] something doesn't necessarily make it right that's my point um so i yeah I really think the whole college
[1901.34 → 1908.10] sports situation is really crappy i I hate that a bunch of you know rich people are making a shed
[1908.10 → 1913.48] load of money on people who aren't getting paid to like appearing games on TV when people are buying
[1913.48 → 1920.36] tickets to attend these games it's like it's like yeah you should come be my backup singer at you know
[1920.36 → 1926.26] Britney Spears concert because just the fact that your face is there is like good enough you should be
[1926.26 → 1931.48] pleased for the opportunity to be on stage with you know me Britney Spears don't worry about getting
[1931.48 → 1935.82] paid about if it's like you know what Britney you can afford to pay your backup dancers and and and
[1935.82 → 1940.68] backup dancers do get paid I'm not drawing a parallel here necessarily and Britney's probably doing fine
[1940.68 → 1945.66] yeah and Britney's in terms of that conduct or maybe not I don't know who knows I'm not I don't
[1945.66 → 1950.52] actually pay much attention to what Britney Spears is up to these days nope is she still making
[1950.52 → 1959.58] music I legitimately don't know um should we do a good news topic yeah let's do oh well I guess that
[1959.58 → 1964.98] wasn't it the next one there was the next one neither was the next one uh neither is that one
[1964.98 → 1970.24] yeah there we go com 2 creative director says pc gaming is in a golden age all right so original
[1970.24 → 1979.00] article here is from pcgamer.com there you go and that's an ad there we go wow I wonder if they are
[1979.00 → 1985.44] getting some money from like path of exile I don't know it's I wonder if they could potentially
[1985.44 → 1993.20] put more ads on the page like if they replace this main one right here that could work yeah with like
[1993.20 → 1998.38] path of exile yeah I wonder if this highlights thing is path of exile it makes it really hard to
[1998.38 → 2003.94] because I like to scroll with the arrow keys yes and I literally cannot find anywhere on this page
[2003.94 → 2011.74] where it's not the hand how do I click anywhere what's it going to open if I click this oh no it's
[2011.74 → 2018.46] okay that's weird okay my mouse pointer is broken it's okay so com 2 will be exclusive to the pc for a
[2018.46 → 2023.14] variety of reasons I'm doing on my computers okay, okay okay, okay well we won't give them too much
[2023.14 → 2028.16] crap about it hey they have to make money, and it ain't easy as a print publication these days totally
[2028.16 → 2037.66] totally get that um so what do we have to say about that uh cool I don't know it's not that surprising
[2037.66 → 2042.92] to be completely honest with the wave of next gen console stuff like not to pc master it's like crazy
[2042.92 → 2049.04] but this is something that I talked about before when Xbox 360 and PS3 came out those were actually
[2049.04 → 2053.22] rather impressive when they sold it to you, they were taking a little bit of a loss and there was
[2053.22 → 2057.76] kind of understanding that most people knew that like okay the controller doesn't cost however much
[2057.76 → 2061.84] money the controller is not going to cost 60 bucks so you buy the console it only comes with one controller
[2061.84 → 2066.22] you buy one more maybe three more controllers in a bunch of games they make their money back
[2066.22 → 2071.36] but at the beginning especially with like PlayStation 3 they were really not making money off selling
[2071.36 → 2078.72] those consoles because they were actually good at the time the next gen consoles were like
[2078.72 → 2083.46] they were making a fairly okay amount of money off each console that was sold, and they were kind of
[2083.46 → 2089.36] not great and a lot of the better experiences are coming to pc and a lot of really competitive stuff
[2089.36 → 2094.92] is pc if you think about it look at League of Legends and data yeah that's so huge right now
[2094.92 → 2100.54] the competitive scene that giant arena in China um League of Legends has its own convention now
[2100.54 → 2107.94] twitch is mostly pc stuff twitch is huge twitch has their own convention now like pc gaming in a
[2107.94 → 2114.74] yeah I heard about that actually yeah yeah um yeah pc gaming's rocking it I don't know indie games
[2114.74 → 2121.14] are huge on pc yeah there's a few very specific indie games that are starting to sell on Wii U better
[2121.14 → 2126.60] than steam which is fascinating I mean the funny thing is the big argument against pc a
[2126.60 → 2135.20] lot of the time is its expensive but in my mind the pc is the least expensive it used to be it did
[2135.20 → 2140.36] used to be very it used to be very expensive it used to be, but that's the thing I don't get is that it
[2140.36 → 2147.24] it hasn't been that way for a really long time no because especially with game costs and this is
[2147.24 → 2152.50] something that I think a lot of people a lot of people kinds of forget it's the whole you know what it
[2152.50 → 2157.82] actually there's an interesting parallel to the way that our videos get released now where they come
[2157.82 → 2163.56] out a week early on vessel which is a paid platform, and then they come a week later on YouTube which is
[2163.56 → 2170.34] not a paid platform it's an ad supported platform so you can watch for free and so people kind of are
[2170.34 → 2177.36] like oh pc gaming's expensive uh you know blah blah, and it's like well hold on a second one of the great
[2177.36 → 2186.16] things about pc gaming is direct x is the fact that pc games are backwards compatible for years
[2186.16 → 2195.04] sometimes even decades backwards and forwards compatibility between a pc and a game is amazing
[2195.04 → 2202.02] so once you've made an investment in a pc you can go back and play an enormous catalogue of amazing gaming
[2202.02 → 2208.64] experiences on the absolute freaking cheap like you can whether it's free yeah whether it's picking
[2208.64 → 2216.58] up used games on Amazon or in the bin at like i I was at a DVD rental store last week uh when I was
[2216.58 → 2222.28] over on the island okay yeah where I guess they don't have internet there um, and so they had like
[2222.28 → 2228.16] they had like old games on a shelf for sale that no one was renting anymore because does anyone rent
[2228.16 → 2234.18] games anyway um yes so they had old games on a shelf, and they had the bc ones though
[2234.18 → 2240.24] whoa yeah so I was just like oh yeah, but that's like really cheap because like two bucks or whatever
[2240.24 → 2244.94] um so that's a really cool thing about the pc and then the other thing is that I think a lot of people
[2244.94 → 2254.82] forget that you don't have to buy a new computer that too scrapyard wars yeah that was like the whole
[2254.82 → 2261.54] point of scrapyard wars for us, it's like you can build like an awesome gaming computer for 300
[2261.54 → 2266.78] combo what was it the combo 380 dollar one where we put our two computers together that one was
[2266.78 → 2274.10] actually sick yeah like actually destroyed a lot of modern benchmarks so yeah and another thing is
[2274.10 → 2281.02] you legit don't have to spend any money at all uh what I think data's free pretty sure data's free tf2
[2281.02 → 2287.00] is free League of Legends is free if you just get not to too tea's horn but if you just get an origin
[2287.00 → 2295.14] account and just idle it they just give you games I got crusader no remorse on the house Ea's on the
[2295.14 → 2299.30] house they just hand out games every once in a while I have wanted to play that I actually bought
[2299.30 → 2307.38] a copy of that game back when my home computer was like a 386 or like a Pentium 75 they're ancient
[2307.38 → 2312.48] yeah they're ancient games but honestly sometimes ancient games are perfect something I can't
[2312.48 → 2318.92] remember I had like anyway I didn't have some kind of something I needed I wasn't super tech-savvy
[2318.92 → 2324.12] because I was like nine or whatever however old I was at the time I bought a copy of that game at
[2324.12 → 2331.66] London drugs and I never got to play it so i as soon as I saw that was like a free offer on origin I was
[2331.66 → 2338.00] like yeah I am going to play this time that's awesome and someone brought up those are crappy
[2338.00 → 2342.80] games they kind of are, but there are zero dollars, and they're a full game that doesn't have microtransactions
[2342.80 → 2346.96] and Team Fortress 2 isn't a crappy game and Team Fortress 2 is great legal engines is really fun
[2346.96 → 2352.80] data is also free I mean we did talk last week on wan show about how both of us liked tf2 before it
[2352.80 → 2359.60] went free to play and I agree but it's free which is good for some people I don't know yeah
[2359.60 → 2364.94] all right so uh I still feel a little bit gypped that I bought it, and now it's a free to play game
[2364.94 → 2370.92] I know you didn't mean this because you probably don't know uh this is something that i actually
[2370.92 → 2376.90] didn't know until recently gypped is actually a racial slur what yeah it refers to gypsies
[2376.90 → 2383.74] so I'm sure you used it unintentionally and I just wanted to call out we have nothing against gypsies
[2383.74 → 2390.56] here at Linus media group at all I had no idea most people don't a lot of those like I know the
[2390.56 → 2401.82] actual term and wow yep wow all right and I have one of my best friends has heavy gypsy lineage
[2401.82 → 2410.30] so I actually didn't find out until someone else in my high school like humanities class
[2410.30 → 2418.56] got screamed at by the teacher for saying it not realizing it and I was like sitting there going
[2418.56 → 2426.48] like oh I say that a lot that could have just as easily been me because I had no idea like, and it's
[2426.48 → 2432.00] one of those like my dad was from a different generation like my dad said it all the time like
[2432.00 → 2438.22] you know oh that deal was uh many people say it I know it's one of those things where it managed to
[2438.22 → 2443.54] make itself into a social norm but probably shouldn't and more awareness of it is probably
[2443.54 → 2448.24] better um so yeah maybe avoid that one yeah no that's cool
[2448.24 → 2453.12] all right the more you know
[2453.12 → 2462.32] so Microsoft is cutting 7800 jobs from its hardware division original article here is from the verge
[2462.32 → 2470.54] less funny um yeah so they write off 7.6 billion from the Nokia deal and announce 7800
[2470.54 → 2478.20] job cuts so uh CEO didn't want to waste any time dropping the company's previous focus on
[2478.20 → 2486.84] devices and services after he was appointed as chief executive last year so that it is you know
[2486.84 → 2493.12] there is something to be said for working for a small company the way we do where everyone has a
[2493.12 → 2500.14] face and a name if you fired 7800 people that would be impossible yeah and like if I was just like
[2500.14 → 2505.38] yeah we're going to move in a different direction we're not gonna we're not going to like okay let's say I did
[2505.38 → 2510.30] do something drastic because you could even look at Linus media group as like a micro example of a
[2510.30 → 2516.16] company like we're a small company but like you know we've got video production, and then we've got like
[2516.16 → 2521.62] our own branded content that we sell advertising against, and then we've got our website and then
[2521.62 → 2528.22] we've got like um I'm sure we do other things okay we mostly just make videos but have a website
[2528.22 → 2536.26] but the point is if one day I was like okay we're not going to do we're not going to do like paid video
[2536.26 → 2540.46] production anymore like uh retail edge for example I don't know how many of you are familiar with retail
[2540.46 → 2546.14] edge but I host some of the video content on intel retail edge it's completely a closed ecosystem
[2546.16 → 2550.22] but like you'll see me over there, and sometimes it's very similar to content that we also release
[2550.22 → 2556.16] on YouTube, but ad supported anyway if I was like okay we're not going to do that any more it would be
[2556.16 → 2562.80] like one person 60 of whose time I would reallocate to like something else or more or if I was like okay
[2562.80 → 2567.70] we're not going to have a website any more you wouldn't have any trouble filling your days with things to
[2567.70 → 2574.60] do literally nothing would change so, so like I would probably just be like slightly more productive
[2574.60 → 2582.08] in the ways of making videos but can you imagine if we had 8 000 people working on like you know
[2582.08 → 2588.24] the Linus tech tips game or something like that you're just like nah and like the board of directors
[2588.24 → 2596.18] boots me out, and they're like Linus tech tips game are you serious who's this Linus guy he doesn't even
[2596.18 → 2603.12] work here anymore blah that's how easily it can happen it's like you know strategic changes to the
[2603.12 → 2608.46] company it doesn't matter how good of a job you were doing isn't that crazy that is kind of crazy
[2608.46 → 2617.36] and like I fully understand the bail I fully understand them being like yeah maybe we shouldn't
[2617.36 → 2626.62] be making phones so much like I get it but damn that's a lot of people yeah so blah blah blah this
[2626.62 → 2631.28] change will enable us to deliver better products and services that our customers love at a more rapid pace
[2631.28 → 2642.96] um yeah so I mean acquisitions man tell me something yeah if Linus media group got acquired which is not
[2642.96 → 2646.60] happening every time I bring this up on my end show I feel like I have to say if it's not happening
[2646.60 → 2654.26] um would you worry about like losing your job I would move to Norway you'd move to Norway why Norway
[2654.26 → 2661.04] I liked Norway okay I guess that's a good reason I really don't like the heat Canada is way too hot for me
[2661.04 → 2669.08] right I was in Norway close to winter I think it was technically winter, but it wasn't like the
[2669.08 → 2673.84] cold part of winter yet yeah, and it was wonderful that said it's pretty nice here that time of year
[2673.84 → 2682.40] too yeah I know but like just don't think it gets that hot in Norway no or Iceland you know what it's
[2682.40 → 2687.00] not supposed to get in there it's not supposed to get that hot here that's true, but this summer has
[2687.00 → 2692.18] been breaking all kinds of records we've got fires all over the place for the last like four days i
[2692.18 → 2697.98] haven't been able to take my baby outside because there's like uh forest fires and all this particulate
[2697.98 → 2703.24] matter in the air and like we look out the window here, and it's kind of like it's foggy all the
[2703.24 → 2710.24] time like it's actually it's pretty sketch at the moment Scandinavia there we go Scandinavia I would move
[2710.24 → 2714.62] to just somewhere in Scandinavia I might not be using the right word because there's a lot of
[2714.62 → 2718.98] different words for like including different because like there's the Nordics and then there's
[2718.98 → 2725.46] like Scandinavia i think they're both regions of multiple countries in that area the point is we
[2725.46 → 2735.06] love you all great hockey players um watchdogs backlash started a policy change at Ubisoft says a CEO so
[2735.06 → 2740.02] original article here is from kit guru did it because it didn't really seem to change much
[2740.02 → 2746.94] well they haven't done anything that bad recently that was pretty bad I think they were around the
[2746.94 → 2754.12] same time okay yeah I mean to call it just the watchdogs debacle or just the unity debacle that was
[2754.12 → 2759.76] like the digging time you know yeah it's like oh yeah, yeah okay so it was which stroke of the shovel
[2759.76 → 2766.22] it was watchdogs was like summer and then unity was like winter right i you know I frankly don't
[2766.22 → 2771.42] remember it was like late summer and early winter or late fall and late summer or something I don't
[2771.42 → 2775.10] remember but I think yeah I think I'll look it up they were close I don't think they were the exact
[2775.10 → 2778.26] same time but I think they were close I could totally be wrong let's see
[2778.26 → 2788.74] okay November 11th 2014 was assassin's creed and then May 27th 2014 was watchdogs so June July august
[2788.74 → 2793.36] September October November so they were seven months apart um oh it's funny that they would
[2793.36 → 2800.14] specifically call out the watchdogs one because they were both pretty, pretty yeah pretty debacle
[2800.14 → 2806.92] they were uh well anyway so let's let's let's call that whole time period the watchdogs time
[2806.92 → 2812.60] yeah um sure do you don't do you not think it's fair to I just achieved my move goal
[2812.60 → 2822.32] wow yeah apple watches uh I was actually sitting writing my review and i I was playing
[2822.32 → 2826.50] with a feature that I hadn't used which is like a workouts feature or something like that so you're
[2826.50 → 2831.24] like I'm going to go vigorously walk and I'm gonna I want to burn this many calories let me know when I'm
[2831.24 → 2838.08] done which is like I don't know it feels kind of backwards couldn't I just think it should just
[2838.08 → 2842.44] happen yeah couldn't I just go for a 30-minute walk, and then it could tell me how many calories i
[2842.44 → 2846.68] burned and then I could be a super smart person and extrapolate from there i I don't know anyway
[2846.68 → 2851.50] the point is while I was sitting writing my review I realized that I had reached like four percent of my
[2851.50 → 2856.16] goal of walking and I was literally sitting at a computer there's that problem with Fitbit too like
[2856.16 → 2862.12] it'll think you're like running potentially if you're like shaking a drink this is funny you have
[2862.12 → 2869.58] reached your move goal having an active day has definitely paid off Linus screw off like just
[2869.58 → 2878.06] screw off my Apple Watch review is uh like i I am working really hard I've actually spent a few hours
[2878.06 → 2883.06] writing it so far and that's that's not including all the time I've spent with the device and any notes
[2883.06 → 2890.82] that I've been making uh I'm like that's a few hours of just writing like 1500 words like it's not
[2890.82 → 2896.82] even a lot it's just rearranging and carefully producing figuring out what's going to go in and
[2896.82 → 2901.50] what's going to get cut because I've only got like eight minutes to keep the viewer's attention in our
[2901.50 → 2910.10] format and I've spent a long time on this trying to avoid turning it into a rant and I reread what is
[2910.10 → 2918.34] about a 70 completion script and boy is it ever negative this is a super stupid product everything
[2918.34 → 2924.40] that I thought was wrong with it is wrong with it and more that I couldn't have possibly predicted
[2924.40 → 2929.72] like I'm not going to give away everything but because I want you guys to watch the review but
[2929.72 → 2932.98] someone in chat was like Apple Watch equals Ellen pow
[2932.98 → 2940.08] oh well at least the Apple Watch didn't sue its former employer
[2940.08 → 2947.26] oh we might need to be careful leading to we might be under fire she did though it's a fact
[2947.26 → 2952.20] that's true like what am I supposed to say I don't know I just don't want to get flamed for
[2952.20 → 2959.08] defamation or something um well the thing about the like the thing about the Apple Watch is that it
[2959.08 → 2966.54] it doesn't even do like I don't know if I mind the home screen I'm considering a dedicated video
[2966.54 → 2973.76] about why the Apple Watch is objectively the worst possible smartwatch where I just take
[2973.76 → 2981.50] one page of apple.com which is all the things the Apple Watch does and point out all the problems with
[2981.50 → 2986.58] every single one of those things it's an interesting idea it's pretty brutal like one thing I've been
[2986.58 → 2990.64] playing with lately this is going to be a weird conversation that we usually have not on
[2990.64 → 2997.00] camera yeah sure go for it is doing things in the review instead of just talking like with the
[2997.00 → 3002.24] structure sensor instead of just being like this mode worked pretty well b-roll blah blah blah blah
[3002.24 → 3007.34] I was like okay let's scan tyrant let's scan a room let's do that kind of stuff so it could be cool
[3007.34 → 3013.38] so I mean it's its it's like here's a stupid thing I miss I still have to figure it out well
[3013.38 → 3017.20] they're still not going to be able to see that so don't worry too much about it, they'll imagine it
[3017.20 → 3022.40] so there's a photos icon on the home screen which do you love how quickly that was brutal do you love
[3022.40 → 3028.06] how quickly it turns off what it's like I'm in the middle of stuff here like can you not just turn
[3028.06 → 3031.76] off immediately thanks looking for something like there's a lot of icons on screen if you're looking
[3031.76 → 3037.72] for something you could definitely it's gone wow, and it's gone so I'm going to click on that there's one
[3037.72 → 3043.04] picture on here and I don't know why there's only one I don't know why I can't browse the rest of my
[3043.04 → 3048.56] camera roll right like i and I'll figure it out before I publish the review, but there's another
[3048.56 → 3055.74] thing like um this is great so I don't expect I know that apple and Google aren't necessarily best
[3055.74 → 3064.08] of friends so I don't expect um you know google play music to necessarily be supported with like a
[3064.08 → 3072.96] music control corresponding app on the watch I don't expect that, but you know someone like and i
[3072.96 → 3080.84] and I know that app support for the watch is coming, but that's not till the fall and apple expects you
[3080.84 → 3088.08] to buy this today what about stuff like Sonos which is like you know a very apple-issue type company
[3088.08 → 3095.80] they're pretty aligned with the apple way why is there absolutely no ability to control anything
[3095.80 → 3101.60] other than the iTunes music player not only that but when music is playing like it is straight up a
[3101.60 → 3108.20] bad music remote which is one of the big things that I use a smartwatch for yeah and pebble is best
[3108.20 → 3115.32] for this because of the tactile buttons but I can live with Google's implementation because the first
[3115.32 → 3123.98] card on screen with an android wear device is always music playback control so you swipe up swipe right I can
[3123.98 → 3129.20] do it without looking at it, and then it's four quadrants of the screen that well you wouldn't have any more
[3129.20 → 3134.62] than four quadrants no matter what but uh it's quadrants of the screen that are volume up and down
[3134.62 → 3139.56] and forward and back for tracks okay so it's like you can actually do it without looking at it
[3139.56 → 3145.94] the Apple Watch you have to actually like navigate to music control are you for real
[3145.94 → 3150.06] I mean
[3150.06 → 3158.84] all right so something Ubisoft back on topic um says they were
[3158.84 → 3164.16] caught out by the complexity of the watchdogs project the large open city environment multiplayer
[3164.16 → 3168.86] rating feature and second screen functionality it's a real challenge to create those types of games when
[3168.86 → 3172.56] they come out especially the first iterations they're not perfect on everything, and it was maybe a bit too
[3172.56 → 3181.42] much for a first attempt um and says that reactions to watchdogs uh have to the demo fiasco so that was
[3181.42 → 3186.04] where they changed the visual quality have reshaped the company's approach to showing off pre-release games
[3186.04 → 3193.00] so hasn't necessarily changed the approach to actually developing the games but has definitely
[3193.00 → 3197.30] changed the approach to not show you something super shiny beforehand but honestly I'm cool with that
[3197.30 → 3203.56] I want a realistic representation that's why when like oh this was a big debate like everywhere was
[3203.56 → 3209.22] when the fallout 4 footage came out you're like oh this game looks old oh my god, and it's like well
[3209.22 → 3214.42] they didn't over show you stuff yeah it's probably exactly what it's going to look like it's not out
[3214.42 → 3220.18] yet it could look worse but i kind of doubt it, and it looks totally fine so maybe we shouldn't hate on
[3220.18 → 3225.22] them for it so that they don't try to fib in the future I forget I know we talked about this are you a
[3225.22 → 3231.84] fallout person fallout yeah super okay yeah definitely all right so uh this original
[3231.84 → 3236.14] source for the next one is from UB group, and it's funny the good timing for this is perfect because
[3236.14 → 3243.70] we had actually mentioned last week that um that Ubisoft's earnings on pc had really increased in
[3243.70 → 3249.08] the last couple of years to the point where it was like looking like a legitimate platform that they
[3249.08 → 3253.66] should probably spend some time developing games a while ago like yeah we don't really make that
[3253.66 → 3261.74] much money on pc yep so in uh in the last quarter uh so first quarter of 2015 2016 fiscal year
[3261.74 → 3268.70] PlayStation 4 accounted for 27 percent of Ubisoft's game sales which is actually really, really interesting
[3268.70 → 3275.36] in itself that a next gen console is uh has overtaken pc that's uh that's pretty incredible
[3275.36 → 3283.28] PlayStation 4 really did win didn't it um that said Microsoft has stuff coming they have cloud stuff
[3283.28 → 3288.78] coming that looks pretty bananas it's just been coming for so long yeah that all of a sudden that
[3288.78 → 3293.80] it's just kind of a mess at this point like the dildo race like the dildo race stay tuned for the
[3293.80 → 3299.52] dildo race what is a dildo race you'll find out um so the PlayStation 4 accounted for 27 percent with the
[3299.52 → 3307.30] pc at 23 percent the x bone at 11 percent and the x360 and PS3 each at 11 percent I'm happy at
[3307.30 → 3312.62] three percent but I'm happy that the don't really do much for I wish someone other than
[3312.62 → 3317.44] Nintendo could make a game for a Nintendo I mentioned this a little bit earlier indie games are getting
[3317.44 → 3325.46] much bigger on Wii U recently which is pretty cool um it's interesting like great pc is doing awesome
[3325.46 → 3331.02] that's perfect I find it interesting that PS4 is doing 27 percent x bone is only doing 11
[3331.02 → 3341.16] that's huge yeah poor Microsoft oh no maybe that's why they're trying to bring more stuff to pc
[3341.16 → 3346.22] because Xbox is failing I wonder if Xbox was doing a lot better if they would actually be pushing in
[3346.22 → 3351.54] the way that they are I do wonder it seems like they want two focus platforms yeah maybe that's
[3351.54 → 3355.10] maybe that's what we're seeing, or maybe we're just seeing the results of a decision that was made
[3355.10 → 3360.34] a really long time ago I mean it's no secret that a modern triple a title takes years to develop so
[3360.34 → 3369.44] that's true there you go uh oh right sponsors linda.com with absolutely no segue whatsoever
[3369.44 → 3376.46] linda.com because things that can take a little while but are extremely beneficial
[3376.46 → 3384.90] learning yeah thank you uh okay expand your knowledge so for those Lamborghini here
[3384.90 → 3394.90] wow I'm not even that proud of this Lamborghini I'm proud of the knowledge that I keep in this box
[3394.90 → 3403.52] I get a new box every day I get a new box and I read that box and I tell you guys about it
[3403.52 → 3408.00] and he had to build a computer every day so that he could research things on linda.com
[3408.00 → 3415.84] linda.com I'm much prouder of that box than I am of you know this t-shirt for that's actually
[3415.84 → 3420.96] okay whatever linda.com the place to learn online they've got experts they've got video courses
[3420.96 → 3425.60] they've got an app everyone has an app you can make notes and then go back to those notes you can see
[3425.60 → 3429.22] your notes on that video that you watch you can make custom playlists you can download them and watch
[3429.22 → 3433.90] them offline you can share them with your friends with the other friends on linda.com you could have
[3433.90 → 3441.88] like a linda.com party a team linda.com should pay us for come well they do pay us but linda.com should
[3441.88 → 3447.84] pay us specifically for coming up with the idea of a Linda party they should have it's like Tupperware
[3447.84 → 3453.30] parties but like learning can your limbo at the Linda party while you learn I think you could, I think the
[3453.30 → 3461.06] idea is that everything at a Linda party should be a new and learning experience yeah uh so anyway the uh
[3461.06 → 3466.58] the plan started only 25 a month head over to linda.com slash wan show for the 10-day all you can
[3466.58 → 3474.82] eat free trial uh our other sponsor are you done it's ready you're done all right our other sponsor
[3474.82 → 3482.24] is Squarespace, and we are putting them on the spot today now those of you who watch wan show regularly
[3482.24 → 3487.34] and do actually watch the sponsor spot sometimes there are some hidden gems in them
[3487.34 → 3493.70] there was a gem two weeks ago where we thought Luke's mom's site was on Squarespace, and it turned
[3493.70 → 3501.44] out that it wasn't and you guys rushing to check out Luke's mom's site uh crashed it and that was a
[3501.44 → 3507.14] big problem so Squarespace um because Luke told me it was on Squarespace so then when I thought it
[3507.14 → 3512.34] crashed I was like holy crap we crashed a Squarespace site how did this even happen uh so because we didn't
[3512.34 → 3517.46] we didn't so Squarespace has state-of-the-art tools that make it easy to create your own beautiful
[3517.46 → 3521.76] customizable website that works great on a phone great on a computer and starting at eight dollars
[3521.76 → 3528.34] a month has scalable plans that will keep your site up so you are not spending your time you know
[3528.34 → 3535.02] figuring out website development when actually what you want to do is do completely different things
[3535.02 → 3540.70] like you know sell your artsy crafty things that you made or have a great looking portfolio well
[3540.70 → 3548.48] we are going to try again this time it really is on Squarespace and boom how do I pronounce this
[3548.48 → 3555.00] Cali bags online so it has been ported to Squarespace and accoutrement and accoutrement
[3555.00 → 3563.02] oh scroll up there we go so we can go to the store we've got like tribal earrings or something
[3563.02 → 3570.22] yeah the refined collection the crochet cape wow your mom's really getting into the like
[3570.22 → 3577.24] they make a lot of stuff interesting yeah double tassel this is like some pretty artsy stuff going
[3577.24 → 3583.92] on here yeah the renaissance bag wow some of the stuff is not cheap no interesting yeah so is this
[3583.92 → 3590.52] all like the handmade it's all one-off yeah oh that's I think why it's expensive I don't understand
[3590.52 → 3596.66] like fashion or handmade things at all right stuff is like a graphics card they made a lot of them
[3596.66 → 3605.18] and they all look the same right so okay we can hey we can sort by rare finds and oddities also
[3605.18 → 3612.22] like you could find this stuff rare finds like sometimes they'll find something very interesting
[3612.22 → 3617.84] and then build something around it or on top of it or whatever to make it right more and better okay
[3617.84 → 3626.44] so we can go to the blog and thankfully I remember the first time we did this where we legitimately
[3626.44 → 3632.58] had the whole wan show audience bum rush a Squarespace site to prove that it wouldn't go down
[3632.58 → 3638.40] the first time I was nervous today I was mostly not nervous I was only a little bit nervous because
[3638.40 → 3645.46] like you never know what can go wrong will go wrong yeah uh but no, no the site is snappy and responsive
[3645.46 → 3652.44] and that is your dog yeah I love your dog, so this is Chloe yeah and Chloe is super clever
[3652.44 → 3658.36] uh she can play a game where you go, and then she like lays over and pretends to be dead my favourite
[3658.36 → 3663.52] one is if you put a tubware on the floor with the opening up she'll put all of her feet in it and kind
[3663.52 → 3667.74] of sit there if you put it with the opening down she'll walk up and play the drums on it if you sit
[3667.74 → 3673.16] forward on the couch she'll come up behind you and scratch your back if you sneeze she'll go get you a
[3673.16 → 3679.52] tissue it's kind of fantastic my mom's a crazy dog trainer so yeah your mom does all kinds of things
[3679.52 → 3685.54] evidently everything from dog training to creating a bags and accoutrements like accoutrement
[3685.54 → 3694.68] whatever a bags company so uh there you go huge thanks to uh whoops huge thanks to uh Luke for
[3694.68 → 3700.18] helping his mom she did require a little bit of help right a little bit okay and huge thanks to uh
[3700.18 → 3705.70] to Luke's mom for actually deciding not to use which whatever she was using before I can't remember
[3705.70 → 3711.84] and getting on Squarespace like her son advised her to I have to thank Travis as well Travis helped me a
[3711.84 → 3721.48] bunch there yeah oh man so uh there you go yeah all right, so this is interesting Apple Watch demand has
[3721.48 → 3728.04] apparently fallen quote unquote a lot are you calling this out in your review or no uh I may talk about it a
[3728.04 → 3736.64] little bit but honestly I think um I think this is a bit of a sensationalist headline the Apple Watch is
[3736.64 → 3744.42] in a really weird spot where it's a first generation product that has a new operating system that was
[3744.42 → 3751.48] announced but isn't coming until the fall and it that is quite expensive like this is like an 800
[3751.48 → 3759.20] dollar watch which is to me absolutely ridiculous that's far more than I have ever spent on the
[3759.20 → 3766.16] smartwatch 3 that I was reviewing was 135 bucks or something I think you said it was 180 or something
[3766.16 → 3771.98] it was under 200 for a long time I don't know if it still is but the whole time I was writing the
[3771.98 → 3777.74] review which was like a month it was that price it has literally all the same functionality probably
[3777.74 → 3784.68] better um in for some things yeah um so anyway it looks like there's been this is based on U.S. numbers
[3784.68 → 3792.36] only, but it looks like there has been a significant decrease in demand uh in the month of June so i
[3792.36 → 3797.44] don't know if I want to read too much also just a little bit how products go through and that is
[3797.44 → 3802.74] another thing to consider it's its a little bit just kind of how things go especially a fairly
[3802.74 → 3808.36] niche kind of product yeah I mean apple doesn't want it to be niche they want it to be like that's
[3808.36 → 3813.36] true the next thing that absolutely everyone has, and you know they've done it they've done a really
[3813.36 → 3821.50] good job of some aspects of it i just um oh this is interesting uh slice intelligence says 66 percent
[3821.50 → 3829.68] have been the least expensive sport model of the sales so far and just 2 000 units of the Apple Watch
[3829.68 → 3835.80] edition have been sold in the U.S. honestly I'm surprised they sold 2 000 I was going to say wasn't
[3835.80 → 3839.32] the edition like stupid expensive I'm not surprised that they didn't sell that many
[3839.32 → 3845.30] yeah 10 000 yeah oh some of them are more really yeah some of them are more it depends on which one
[3845.30 → 3850.04] you want like if you want like the rose gold one with this or the yellow gold one with that and
[3850.04 → 3854.68] they've got different straps and stuff like that it's its it's all it's all kind of ridiculous so
[3854.68 → 3861.84] tell us this let's straw pull the crap out of this straw pull I wonder if straw pull knows who we are
[3861.84 → 3872.10] I have no idea I hope so our p okay what's going on with the Apple Watch people are a new version of
[3872.10 → 3881.88] straw pull coming people are cluing in how do you spell cluing oh no, no e cluing in that it's not that
[3881.88 → 3891.88] great natural um sales decay after like a big hype launch um what are some other options' turnip
[3891.88 → 3898.50] turnip has to be an option you know what let's just let's just go with uh you know natural sales decay
[3898.50 → 3904.50] after launch and or people are cluing in that it's not that great I want to hear what you guys think
[3904.50 → 3913.54] and I am posting that in the twitch chat no whoops that didn't work I did not I did not go in that
[3913.54 → 3921.98] thing um okay so let's move on to our next topic while people vote on that particular one right
[3921.98 → 3927.72] there AMD has lowered there's all bad news out of AMD right now AMD lowers revenue expectations
[3927.72 → 3933.00] because of poor APU sales you know the funny thing is intel's like doing the same thing
[3933.00 → 3938.70] and like it all comes down to that whole the enthusiasts are telling you what they want the
[3938.70 → 3942.56] enthusiasts are the only ones that get like excited about products and buy them for fun
[3942.56 → 3948.72] and we keep not listening to them, we keep making Apus, and we keep making but this one's the exact same
[3948.72 → 3954.84] speed, but that's okay because the graphics core is awesome but the power consumption is so much better
[3954.84 → 3966.06] yay so uh poor APU sales and more bad news out of AMD it just cost them what was it 33 million
[3966.06 → 3975.24] it just cost them 33 million to cancel their 20 nanometre hold on their 20 nanometre commitments
[3975.24 → 3984.64] with uh TSMC if I recall correctly AMD officially cancels 20 nanometre chips and uh hold on
[3984.64 → 3989.74] original article here is from kit guru I can't remember who it's with, so this is like a big
[3989.74 → 3996.66] problem as a blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah AMD did not reveal when it plans
[3996.66 → 4001.14] to roll out its first chips to be made using global foundry's 14 nanometre fine manufacturing
[4001.14 → 4007.12] technology or TSMC's 16 nanometre fine however it is evident that the cancellation of Amur and Nolan
[4007.12 → 4012.08] means that AMD will have nothing new to offer for tablets uh based on the upcoming Windows 10
[4012.08 → 4019.76] in the coming months ah blah blah blah blah blah blah so AMD will not virtue as a result of such
[4019.76 → 4027.58] decision by TSMC and blah blah blah etc etc etc so yeah TSMC has designed its 20 nanometre
[4027.58 → 4032.22] manufacturing technology primarily for mobile system on chips and that means AMD will not produce
[4032.22 → 4040.30] a single chip using the cln20 SOC whereas NVIDIA will only use it for one SOC the Terra x1 so it's its
[4040.30 → 4045.26] fascinating the way the technology is changing where you have to kind of decide as
[4045.26 → 4050.58] you're developing a new manufacturing process are we optimizing for power consumption or are we
[4050.58 → 4057.32] optimizing for bigger chips or smaller chips or or or whatever else the case may be and the fact that AMD
[4057.32 → 4064.62] no longer owns its own fabs means that someone else's strategic direction in terms of developing
[4064.62 → 4069.88] manufacturing manufacturing manufacturing process um will affect AMD's ability to bring certain products
[4069.88 → 4080.06] to market I'm just trying to find the uh the quote real men have fabs uh who said this that was uh
[4080.06 → 4089.14] but someone sanders the third I can't it was one of AMD's uh hold on yep jerry sanders the third
[4089.14 → 4099.72] said real men have fabs um and that that didn't work for AMD they just couldn't handle the financial
[4099.72 → 4104.98] burden of continuing to develop new manufacturing processes, and they are now just kind of at the
[4104.98 → 4110.58] mercy of outside the whole twitch chat is saying real men have fire poles women have fire poles real
[4110.58 → 4115.88] firemen have fire poles some except the ones that don't because
[4115.88 → 4122.20] my brother's hall does not have one even for firefighters like a fire pole is not necessarily
[4122.20 → 4125.42] faster what if you just had a single story building
[4125.42 → 4135.42] and you didn't have to go downstairs or poles at all or just like optimize your building layout
[4135.42 → 4143.44] a little bit all right so IBM has unveiled the world's first
[4143.44 → 4153.12] seven nanometre chip with a silicon germanium channel and EU lithography IBM crosses the 10
[4153.12 → 4161.12] nanometre barrier this is some next level stuff this is actually insane because for the first time in
[4161.12 → 4169.26] as long as I can sort of conveniently remember intel is not completely alone out in front leading the
[4169.26 → 4174.28] charge I thought you're going to say a single digit nanometre oh that that's definitely the first
[4174.28 → 4184.18] time so yeah we have no idea on costs we have no idea on timelines I don't even care they did it
[4184.18 → 4189.34] they did that's super cool so they were working with global foundries remember this is the spin-off
[4189.34 → 4194.38] from AMD now separate company they worked with Samsung state university of New York and various
[4194.38 → 4199.64] equipment suppliers and produced the first seven nanometre chips with functional transistors
[4199.64 → 4208.34] commercial chips remain at least two years away which is probably optimistic this I'm sure like 99
[4208.34 → 4213.64] percent sure this won't happen because IBM is like super not a consumer facing company but would it be
[4213.64 → 4221.30] interesting in like six years from now if you were installing IBM CPUs and computers i i i I don't see it
[4221.30 → 4225.20] you know no, no because they're not a consumer facing I don't think they yeah I don't think they
[4225.20 → 4230.94] even want I don't think they want to either they spun off their their chip manufacturing
[4230.94 → 4236.22] to global foundries yeah like they just seem to want no part of it other than they just want to
[4236.22 → 4243.64] do industrial enterprise stuff which like apparently they're doing very well with that so sure yeah so
[4243.64 → 4248.32] uh blah blah it's still important since it's the first commercially yeah it's okay so it doesn't matter
[4248.32 → 4252.22] that we're not going to see chips based on it for quite a while because it's its the first
[4252.22 → 4258.14] commercially viable sub 10 nanometre fine logic chip uh using silicon germanium as a channel material
[4258.14 → 4263.28] rather than just silicon, so silicon's days have been numbered for a long time yeah it looks like
[4263.28 → 4271.70] they're officially over um due to the incredibly tight stacking, so this is a 30 nanometre transistor
[4271.70 → 4278.22] pitch IBM claims a surface area reduction of close to 50 percent over today's 10 nanometre
[4278.22 → 4285.14] processes now this is something that most people don't know not all x nanometre whether we're
[4285.14 → 4292.50] talking about 20 nanometers or 34 nanometers or whatever not all manufacturing processes at each node
[4292.50 → 4298.12] are created equal there are other factors at play here that can affect the density of the chip the
[4298.12 → 4304.90] efficiency of the transistors the heat output and all those kinds of things so it's not enough to just
[4304.90 → 4309.18] create a seven nanometre chip that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get a 50 percent
[4309.18 → 4315.64] size reduction you have to actually work on other things as well, so higher electron mobility is part
[4315.64 → 4321.40] of what makes silicon germanium more suitable than silicon for smaller transistors and I mean a lot of this
[4321.40 → 4325.78] is like super technical details that might not have too much relevance to most of our viewers but
[4325.78 → 4334.82] the point is it's not over the race to smaller and more efficient and more powerful is not over for at
[4334.82 → 4339.46] least a couple of years we are going to see significant improvements over the next couple of years
[4339.46 → 4344.98] because the technology barriers continue to be broken down thank you IBM and global foundries and
[4344.98 → 4352.82] all those folks super awesome when I read this in the thing I was like oh this is going to be
[4352.82 → 4357.92] a rumour mill site, and it's going to be crap and there's going to be no actual information it's going
[4357.92 → 4363.52] to be some dude like plotting a graph and being like they probably are doing this right now and then
[4363.52 → 4371.70] it wasn't and that's super fantastic Microsoft presents groove music streaming service so we'll go ahead
[4371.70 → 4379.18] and uh we'll pull this off of microsoft.com slash groove dash music that seems like as good a primary
[4379.18 → 4384.38] source as you can have for something huh the Apple Watch says it's time to stand up so it's funny it goes
[4384.38 → 4390.12] from telling me that I'm exercising you're doing a great job Linus good job moving today yeah to telling
[4390.12 → 4394.48] me that I need to stand up and move a little for one minute you're not doing so much Linus you need to
[4394.48 → 4401.54] stand up more what are you doing so basically this is your watch this is just a hey Linus you have an email
[4401.54 → 4404.22] you like to change the song okay book
[4404.22 → 4412.14] that would actually rent a person that would be kind of a funny sketch you know it's like the smart
[4412.14 → 4418.66] person the smartwatch it's like you know what everything my smartwatch do I could do just as easily
[4418.66 → 4427.24] with a butler that's why smartwatches are stupid that is why apple can't sell ten thousand dollar
[4427.24 → 4432.16] smartwatches because they just want because anyone who can afford a ten thousand dollar watch
[4432.16 → 4435.70] could just hire a freaking butler to change a song
[4435.70 → 4442.40] hey Siri actually sir my name is Arthur
[4442.40 → 4446.24] hey Siri you're Siri if I tell you to be Siri
[4446.24 → 4450.36] you go for a run, and he has to like to run beside you and if you're like
[4450.36 → 4454.08] next song it's like take your phone out of your pocket and like
[4454.08 → 4459.00] book put it back in no, no he should be holding no, no you have a Bluetooth link to his phone there
[4459.00 → 4463.76] you go so he stops for a minute changes the song and then has to kind of sprint to catch up
[4463.76 → 4471.34] i kind of wish we made this video oh we can, we still could yeah be still could smartwatch
[4471.34 → 4482.42] smartwatch butler edition yeah hmm fantastic okay uh okay so Luke setting off an email yeah
[4482.42 → 4488.30] I'm going to make I'm going to do a little more I really want to do this smartwatch or like Apple Watch
[4488.30 → 4494.96] butler I'm going to cover something real quick while you're doing that probably most people watching
[4494.96 → 4500.90] this know already Ellen pow has resigned from her former role as the interim CEO of Reddit she's been
[4500.90 → 4508.64] replaced with one of the co-founders actually Steve Huffman founder and original Reddit CEO actually
[4508.64 → 4514.02] he's returning uh they were saying that he's like the benchmark of a CEO that they were looking for
[4514.02 → 4517.46] and they were looking around, and then he was available so they got the benchmark blah blah blah
[4517.46 → 4519.66] there was a lot of bragging stuff going on and that's cool
[4519.66 → 4530.52] um apparently it was a mutual decision uh blah blah blah basically pow and the rest of the chair
[4530.52 → 4539.66] people were in a non-agreance about uh Reddit user growth and all this kind of stuff so they split ways
[4539.66 → 4547.40] so yeah, yeah even in her leaving the company I don't think all the hatred was actually recognized
[4547.40 → 4549.40] wrecked
[4549.40 → 4558.92] yep okay so right groove music service let's go back to that um so basically it's just a
[4558.92 → 4563.94] rebranding of Xbox music which is a rebranding of June music i kind of wish they'd just gone back to
[4563.94 → 4571.06] June I liked June yeah you're the June good name uh yeah yeah it was awesome yeah I loved it there was
[4571.06 → 4575.48] like a few minor things that I would have liked to change that's it like i I thought it was just the
[4575.48 → 4581.96] the biggest like butthead move ever to call it Xbox yeah like i I guess the Xbox is entertainment
[4581.96 → 4588.58] no Xbox is games yeah you've worked so hard to make Xbox games why don't you just let it be games
[4588.58 → 4593.60] and we can just call music June or apparently um groove
[4593.60 → 4603.02] just keep naming it different things Hotmail no outlook air explorer no I don't actually know what it is
[4603.02 → 4608.44] anymore should have just stuck with project spartan it is a new yeah I like spartan yeah I can't
[4608.44 → 4612.94] remember what it's called anymore either spartan was cool you know the thing about the whole
[4612.94 → 4619.52] the whole rebranding thing is that particularly the outlook one really drives me crazy and like i
[4619.52 → 4625.98] understand why uh why sky drive changed to one drive yeah it was actually like a trademark and why
[4625.98 → 4631.98] I had to do that what was it metro tiles no yeah metro tiles yeah changed to modern UI or
[4631.98 → 4636.56] metro UI um in this case it just seems kind of ridiculous and in the case of the outlook one it
[4636.56 → 4642.26] just caused confusion yeah because you have a program called outlook, and then you have like a
[4642.26 → 4649.24] webmail interface that literally has nothing to do with that program except that you could if you set
[4649.24 → 4655.22] it up have this mail show up in that program and sync, but you could also have a different service
[4655.22 → 4662.86] and or a different client so that was just really confusing and groove music is just like the word
[4662.86 → 4672.82] groove did anything good ever have groovy in the name groovy baby yeah Austin powers was kind of a good
[4672.82 → 4680.84] movie I can't even do it right I mean okay straw poll can you think of anything good that was called
[4680.84 → 4688.20] groove or groovy other than anything that Austin powers ever defined as groovy or good like I'm talking
[4688.20 → 4694.60] like the official name like it has to be like a company or a product or something now I need to google
[4694.60 → 4696.60] this and get examples of things called groove
[4696.60 → 4705.08] google's just going to be like a groove is a thing in other no that's not what I'm talking about
[4705.08 → 4710.62] groove is a sense of propulsive rhythmic feel or sense that's actually the first definition
[4710.62 → 4718.26] I'm surprised actually did you type it with a capital no oh interesting, so there's already
[4718.26 → 4724.40] something called groove all right so you guys let us know is groove just a stupid name for anything
[4724.40 → 4732.08] really oh that's funny anything good groovy so we got turnip winning we've got yes coming in
[4732.08 → 4736.88] second, and we've got what is most people disagree with me most people disagree with me
[4736.88 → 4742.30] so there you go most people do not agree with Linus today and that's fine Linus can accept that
[4742.30 → 4748.38] groove shark groove shark what wasn't that something else groove shark
[4748.38 → 4758.34] groove shark a new groove shark is online and streaming okay so it was a
[4758.34 → 4765.96] what is this web-based music streaming service that's really similar to something called groove
[4765.96 → 4772.60] oh dear music fans today we are shutting down groove shark there you go so shut down in 2015
[4772.60 → 4781.34] so that timing was good yep for Microsoft if they really really wanted to use the
[4781.34 → 4788.40] word groove in their online music streaming service name uh what can we say about it so blah blah
[4788.40 → 4793.08] renaming Xbox music was originally part of the zoom music management software though they distance it
[4793.08 → 4796.68] after the failure they experienced with the zoom device changed over to Xbox music with the release of
[4796.68 → 4802.20] Windows 8 um didn't get much traction since it only offered game music and was only available on the Xbox
[4802.20 → 4808.04] 360 didn't work on smartphones well now being renamed to groove music with the same pricing model 999 a
[4808.04 → 4813.28] month or 100 a year no info on whether they will release a family plan and currently an app within
[4813.28 → 4818.92] Windows 10 no new features to announce or yet aside from the ability to play music uploaded to
[4818.92 → 4825.60] one drive which is you're a Google music person I am what do you think what do i think it's
[4825.60 → 4830.24] more expensive than google music with absolutely nothing compelling about it to make me want to switch to it
[4830.24 → 4839.64] cool in line with Microsoft's new direction of service as a service company yeah that's fine I guess it's just like
[4839.64 → 4844.96] you know apple at least did something, and it's funny because we gave apple crap about not really innovating
[4844.96 → 4852.58] at least they've got like their thing about artists engaging with fans because apple's a social network now or
[4852.58 → 4857.96] something uh but at least they had something Microsoft is literally taking something that wasn't successful
[4857.96 → 4867.22] calling it groove and then like now they're expecting android and iOS versions sometime soon after Windows 10
[4867.22 → 4872.94] which is also soon so I don't even know why they're talking about it at all right now they should just be
[4872.94 → 4877.34] avoiding talking about it, and they super miss the boat like everybody else is already
[4877.34 → 4884.60] doing very well, well remember too like even if you missed the boat, and you capture three percent of
[4884.60 → 4890.00] the online music streaming service revenue it's still going to be it's still going to be you know a positive
[4890.00 → 4897.18] thing yeah um is at six o'clock already six o'clock already wow what have we even talked about on the
[4897.18 → 4901.82] we covered like most of the dog we know the funny thing is there wasn't even really that much
[4901.82 → 4908.66] no um, and you know I've noticed that about the land show recently we've just it's just kind of been
[4908.66 → 4912.60] whatever it slows down during this time of year so we got to fill it in a little bit more
[4912.60 → 4920.04] okay when Japan and U.S. not the actual countries companies within the countries are going to be duelling
[4920.04 → 4927.82] giant robots did you hear about this yes yeah this should have been not in rapid fire
[4927.82 → 4933.58] yeah this is like kind of awesome in fact the fastest possible that I filmed today i I referenced
[4933.58 → 4938.82] that I actually wasted like 30 seconds of the fastest possible just talking about that robot battle that's
[4938.82 → 4943.18] coming because I think it's awesome yeah because fastest possible is only like three and a half to
[4943.18 → 4946.96] four minutes of actual content so it's like an eighth of the video I think it's interesting though
[4946.96 → 4951.36] that like the japan robot looks like it would beat the crap out of something in a melee contest
[4951.36 → 4957.04] probably because Japan likes melee and bananas and stuff then the American ones like
[4957.04 → 4964.86] because America really likes guns Canada and the Japanese guys were like let's do melee I'm like oh
[4964.86 → 4970.02] I realize that would be way cooler to watch but like yeah I also get why you're asking that
[4970.02 → 4976.14] melee is going to be way cooler to watch I'm stoked for that but like the Americans might lose now
[4976.14 → 4980.94] apparently people prefer the less focused wan show lately where we just are apparently just talking
[4980.94 → 4986.66] about whatever so there you go that's a thing um speaking of just talking about whatever I think
[4986.66 → 4993.62] the show is pretty much over but I have something pretty exciting um easel has made some very
[4993.62 → 5001.00] interesting headway on the new workflow for our video production so I will be installing a couple of
[5001.00 → 5009.02] virtualized instances of Windows 8 we may not even need a server OS any more okay of Windows 8 on the
[5009.02 → 5015.72] uh 36 core server and seeing if we might have a workflow that involves multiple instances of adobe
[5015.72 → 5020.90] media encoder rather than a five thousand dollar piece of software, and we may be able to achieve
[5020.90 → 5026.46] the same performance and in the case of Adobe Premiere because a big problem with the footage that we have
[5026.46 → 5031.78] now is it's really hard to edit with because it skips around as you scrub through the timeline like you
[5031.78 → 5035.18] you'll see like freeze frames here and there as you're as you're scrubbing through
[5035.18 → 5041.80] well we're going to be using a different codec and um this new workflow that we're working on
[5041.80 → 5047.52] gives us better performance in premiere faster overall video export times and could potentially
[5047.52 → 5053.18] cost us actually very little so I'm excited yeah I'm excited to check that out that's cool and I'm
[5053.18 → 5059.10] excited about all 6500 of you I think we actually peaked a little bit higher than that all 6500 of you
[5059.10 → 5064.66] that tuned into the wan show today thank you all very much, and we will see you again on wan show next
[5064.66 → 5076.06] week same bat time same bat channel also by then you may have seen the video with the toys dildo racing
[5076.06 → 5089.54] oh yeah this outro oh what the heck just happened linda.com is this it okay we're done here goodbye
[5089.54 → 5097.64] Squarespace oops Squarespace oh crap where's the Linda one there Linda
