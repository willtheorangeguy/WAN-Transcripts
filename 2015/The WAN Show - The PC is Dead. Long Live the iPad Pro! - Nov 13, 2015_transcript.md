[0.00 --> 10.92]  okay so i know it's been a while since we've said this because quite frankly most of the time
[10.92 --> 16.34]  lately there just really hasn't been any excuse for our lateness i think it's these lights
[16.34 --> 18.08]  that's why we're pale
[18.08 --> 26.36]  okay not not what i was talking about at all but i you know i like your effort that's why
[26.36 --> 33.96]  you're still here it drives real hard folks real hard brandon get other lights that don't make me
[33.96 --> 40.84]  look so dead a plus for effort um so i know i haven't said this in a while but really today
[40.84 --> 48.02]  we were like this close not to being on time but to being like pretty close to like five minutes
[48.02 --> 52.72]  off or something like it was actually okay we were about seven minutes late and basically i was
[52.72 --> 59.82]  dropping these sponsor spots into place and this is really weird like this is this is kind of cool
[59.82 --> 67.98]  because i got a first-hand look into the inner workings of the mind of windows 10 um where
[67.98 --> 75.22]  xsplit the like the program window was here here you know what i'll just uh oh i don't think i have
[75.22 --> 81.92]  a scene where i can screen share with you guys i will create one very quickly that's gonna get
[81.92 --> 88.38]  okay so i could see picture that's gonna lag out super hard uh that's a pretty good computer should
[88.38 --> 100.70]  be okay all right yeah task manage that that shiz 17 cpu y'all yeah that's right 47 wow we put a 4770k in
[100.70 --> 106.58]  this and that was all on paul and kyle's behalf if i recall correctly because we we were we were
[106.58 --> 111.00]  crap we the stream was dropping frames because we had two guests or something along those lines i think
[111.00 --> 117.34]  anyway so the point is i could see my xsplit window it was kind of here i'm reenacting this for you guys
[117.34 --> 122.48]  and i could see us moving around and things moving in the frame and i could actually right click on the
[122.48 --> 130.36]  desktop but and i can number lock was working but it was the most bizarre thing because i couldn't
[130.36 --> 136.08]  click anything start menu wasn't coming up and even pressing the front button was not resetting
[136.08 --> 141.30]  the computer but number lock was working i was like this computer's responding so i was like okay
[141.30 --> 148.66]  well hard shut down he's gonna bork my windows again when just boot it up and the motherboard's
[148.66 --> 155.90]  all like oh your uh csm boot settings it's stable you need to change these things to whatever if you
[155.90 --> 162.96]  want to do anything go into the secure boot settings i'm like oh not this again so i go and i go i set
[162.96 --> 167.34]  it to a bunch of things and then i set it to full auto and i reboot it again and i kind of go
[167.34 --> 175.96]  now just hold on a minute here my voice isn't quite back yet folks and i go into the actual boot
[175.96 --> 181.90]  devices and there's nothing in there no drive no drive what do you mean no drive
[181.90 --> 189.44]  where's my drive why not say there's no boot device found right that's what my laptop was
[189.44 --> 196.46]  doing i'm using a john's laptop actually yeah my the ss the ms m sata drive in my laptop died so i've
[196.46 --> 201.50]  swapped that anyways no big deal but it was just like oh noob no boot device that's fine where was
[201.50 --> 209.76]  that error asus so so anyway so it takes me like 12 minutes or whatever to diagnose this so i'm
[209.76 --> 215.66]  i go i go down i look at the computer it's plugged in so i kind of go well that's what happened my ssd
[215.66 --> 223.52]  died while i was operating the computer i don't ask for much from this computer two hours a week
[223.52 --> 230.44]  it doesn't even go into sleep it shuts down everything but two hours a week and honestly
[230.44 --> 235.98]  it's only really supposed to be like an hour and a half a week and it's on a ups so like it gets the
[235.98 --> 242.96]  best power in the building i ask for so little and it's just no no whatever linus did you big old big
[242.96 --> 250.70]  old f you linus because i hate you and you know what i hate you too computer anyway new state of cable
[250.70 --> 258.18]  boots up we're ready to go but we're late and on top of that i just wasted another five minutes
[258.18 --> 263.64]  explaining why we're late we haven't even intro topics making us even later unless you've watched
[263.64 --> 268.44]  it on youtube you don't know what we're going to talk about i want a refund can you get that for this
[268.44 --> 276.74]  show on time oh wow i want a refund what does that even mean i don't know i don't know but what i do
[276.74 --> 283.78]  know is that porn hub released some stats from their site showing that their traffic compared to
[283.78 --> 288.60]  typical averages lowered immediately after the fallout 4 launch telling us something that i'm
[288.60 --> 295.58]  pretty sure we all know uh tim cook declares the end of the pc ushers in the age of the ipad pro
[295.58 --> 302.12]  also broadwell e specifications have leaked and pokemon gen 1 is coming to 3ds
[302.12 --> 311.90]  3ds intro time oh my god the intro worked the intro always works these days man
[311.90 --> 314.94]  wasn't it like two weeks ago that it didn't work
[314.94 --> 319.40]  this is so funny people are like 15 of the traffic was luke
[319.40 --> 321.40]  hey i mean that's fair
[321.40 --> 328.86]  squasers
[328.86 --> 334.58]  squaspees
[334.58 --> 340.04]  oh man i gotta do something about that voice okay see this is the trick this is the trick
[340.04 --> 347.70]  if i make it blank now then it'll work next time i just always forget we should have a script that
[347.70 --> 352.34]  just does that you know what we should have is we should have like a checklist for the end of the
[352.34 --> 357.56]  show because i swear it has been a month since i've remembered to pull down the hey we're live
[357.56 --> 364.74]  tweet and facebook post and then inevitably inevitably people are like hey how come you took down the
[364.74 --> 373.54]  archive okay for one the video is called we're live it is not called the wan show okay the wan show has
[373.54 --> 383.54]  been running for like two years the wan show has never been called we're live not once and number two
[383.54 --> 388.26]  i understand your confusion and it's completely my bad this is my way of apologizing
[388.26 --> 394.98]  he likes to apologize by making you feel like it's your fault but then also admitting guilt in some
[394.98 --> 403.14]  way yes it's that way works best for everyone so let's get into it you know i'm at that stage where
[403.14 --> 409.62]  i'm like feeling pretty much better but there's like a gigantic loogie somewhere between like my nose
[409.62 --> 415.30]  and my throat like kind of in here somewhere and like it's like you can't you can't really do anything
[415.30 --> 423.70]  about it i think i just swallowed it oh that's better or worse in other news about swallowing
[423.70 --> 433.78]  porn hub oh you know that doesn't happen much it could it could but it's probably like a whole
[433.78 --> 438.74]  category for that probably actually actually i'm probably just missing the right keyword
[438.74 --> 446.42]  um all right so this was posted originally on the forum by uh sam fisher and the original source
[446.42 --> 452.58]  here is from venture beat let's go ahead and screen screen share with you guys so porn hubs traffic dipped
[452.58 --> 462.26]  significantly the day that fallout 4 came out confirming once and for all that gamers um
[463.14 --> 470.58]  who are on the internet sometimes on their computers might occasionally partake in the uh in the uh
[470.58 --> 475.54]  hub of porn website i think that's what it's called right hub of porn i wouldn't know much about it
[475.54 --> 482.90]  myself uh yeah yeah okay how about porn website so okay so in the in the time after the fallout right
[482.90 --> 486.90]  here i'm gonna go back to this graph so in the time after the fallout release uh basically this is a
[486.90 --> 494.66]  traffic change among gamers specifically so the actual dip is probably less significant because
[494.66 --> 504.26]  porn hub has actually used google data in order to um segment their their overall traffic into just
[504.26 --> 512.18]  the traffic that's also interested in gaming well that makes sense then which makes almost too groomed
[512.18 --> 518.74]  i i wish it was overall traffic nothing can be too groomed oh wow yes okay um i wish it was overall
[518.74 --> 523.06]  traffic not just gaming fans me too that would be a way more interesting statistic it would i didn't
[523.06 --> 528.02]  realize that and that makes this way more boring yeah so so anyway so and so the the traffic change
[528.02 --> 536.18]  after the fallout 4 release you can see it was down as much as 10 percent however after looks like i
[536.18 --> 543.70]  don't know what three four five 15 or so hours of continuous gaming it was time for porn hub and
[543.70 --> 551.06]  then time to go to bed well that looks like on the first night they gamed a bit and then had a little
[551.06 --> 556.58]  no no that's 4 a.m then 4 p.m so that's a 24 hour period you're looking at no no it's a little more
[556.58 --> 560.74]  little more it's a 30 hour or so yeah yeah so the first night it comes out they play a little bit
[560.74 --> 565.62]  then they're like i gotta go work in the morning have some fun time go to sleep yeah work work work work do
[565.62 --> 570.02]  whatever do whatever do whatever do play again the next day and then now everyone's had a little
[570.02 --> 575.14]  bit more follow time so they're more inclined to spend a little bit of time before going to bed doing
[575.14 --> 579.54]  other things and then everyone's like okay whoop and then go back to bed okay so this is probably
[579.54 --> 590.98]  going to be the worst straw poll we've ever done that's saying a lot um so does a hot new
[590.98 --> 597.54]  game release you should just go full bore and make it fap on night one versus fap on night two
[597.54 --> 606.34]  i'm not going to do that that's just no does a hot new game release affect your all right schedule
[607.38 --> 614.98]  so we're gonna go with uh yes no and really those are the only options because there's there's not
[614.98 --> 619.54]  there's not really a whole lot to it beyond that so i'm gonna go ahead and drop that in the twitch chat
[619.54 --> 627.54]  love to hear from you guys about this one i'm gonna go ahead and vote okay oh wow the results
[627.54 --> 634.74]  are pouring in they're bouncing back and they are wow this is the people are the the two the two wow
[634.74 --> 642.18]  everything everything is jockeying for position this is this is the tightest poll that we have ever run
[642.18 --> 648.82]  some might say warmest warmest no one would say that but possibly not most inviting best groomed
[648.82 --> 655.54]  perhaps so we've got the majority of you it looks like it's settling in a little bit we've got the
[655.54 --> 662.82]  majority of you saying no a hot new game release is not enough to get you off of your schedule with uh
[662.82 --> 670.10]  a third of you saying yes indeed it would and uh 28 of you voting for turnip the way you know you should
[670.10 --> 675.86]  yep all right let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here i can't believe anyone even sponsors
[675.86 --> 683.62]  this show it's uh sort of horrible i mean it's great but in just sort of a horrible way or it's
[683.62 --> 688.90]  horrible in a great way yeah i love this show all right so posted by z mule on the forum the original
[688.90 --> 694.82]  article here is from the telegraph you're posting links today right awesome okay we got this tim click
[694.82 --> 706.74]  declares the end of the pc and hints at new medical product okay so uh i don't know wow that's great
[706.74 --> 716.02]  this article on telegraph has 1600 comments it's amazing how cyclical this whole argument ends up
[716.02 --> 722.50]  being um so anyway i'll give you guys some context for this so here's the here's the quote if you're
[722.50 --> 729.46]  looking at a pc this is uh tim cook why would you buy a pc anymore no really why would you buy one
[731.38 --> 738.66]  and then he continues um yes the ipad pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many
[738.66 --> 745.78]  many people they will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else oh right we
[745.78 --> 751.38]  make phones other than their phones i added that that bit about oh we make phones i guess we need to
[751.38 --> 760.02]  sell those too um the really weird thing here is apple also makes pcs pretty decent ones last time i
[760.02 --> 768.66]  checked and also last time i checked their pc market share was rising not lowering um i can't find rising
[768.66 --> 775.14]  falling not lowering i can't find the graph but someone made a infograph based on the people claiming
[775.14 --> 780.98]  that the pc was dead over time and i forgot i should have had that in here for this segment but it's
[780.98 --> 788.74]  amazing because it's been going on since like a really long time ago like in like the crazy the pc
[788.74 --> 794.42]  space is exploding era people have been saying it since then so why don't we take turns answering uh mr
[794.42 --> 802.98]  cook's question here um if you're looking at a pc why would you buy a pc anymore no really why would you buy
[802.98 --> 809.22]  one one answer one answer at a time one answer at a time yeah you're you're first one's too easy
[809.22 --> 815.06]  well i i think there's a lot that are too easy actually so go ahead gaming okay gaming you can
[815.06 --> 822.18]  game on an ipad pro it's no it's the it's the job okay yeah no no i am going to we have to take turns i
[822.18 --> 826.98]  want to play games that can't be played on an ipad pro uh well then you should probably lobby that
[826.98 --> 831.46]  developer to develop for the ipad pro the ipad pro is extremely powerful because the game it's not
[831.46 --> 836.26]  powerful enough though it's not powerful enough okay all right so you want a machine that can
[836.26 --> 845.62]  game and is powerful all right i got argument number two maybe just maybe i want a peripheral
[845.62 --> 851.54]  that is not bluetooth well you should probably and does not require an external like dongle you should
[851.54 --> 856.42]  probably learn to use modern peripherals you're just behind the times this is going to get confusing
[856.42 --> 862.26]  for my modern peripherals are just fine sir that is a stupid argument and mine is a good one you're
[862.26 --> 870.58]  next um i i need to uh have interesting input devices that i can't have on an ipad pro that's
[870.58 --> 876.66]  basically mine rephrase try again no no because of like capture cards and whatnot if i'm rendering i said
[876.66 --> 881.38]  i wanted peripheral devices that are not bluetooth were you not talking about keyboard and mouse no
[881.38 --> 886.34]  it's just peripherals i could be a printer i could it could be a printer okay printer's a peripheral
[886.34 --> 895.46]  okay um i don't know enough about the ipad pro to be completely basically it's a big ipad and it's faster
[897.70 --> 903.22]  what could you need to do with a pc that you can't do with an ipad all i really do with it is play games right
[903.22 --> 908.34]  oh okay well fine i'll come up with other things how about an external display okay what if i want to
[908.34 --> 913.62]  peripheral actually multitask okay arguably that is a peripheral so i'm repeating my own argument you
[913.62 --> 919.54]  said peripheral which took way too many things out of the argument maybe he's right maybe he's right
[919.54 --> 924.82]  what if i want to upgrade it what if i want to upgrade it but that was part of the not fast enough
[924.82 --> 930.02]  thing oh oh crap because we said it's not fast enough okay and we said we want to be able to plug
[930.02 --> 936.34]  more things in we will come up with something and then games falls in under the same category okay i need
[936.34 --> 943.06]  access to my file system you can't do that on ipad pro no it's just ios i don't use them i don't
[943.06 --> 948.34]  know it's just a big ipad that's pathetic they have changed nothing it doesn't even have force touch
[948.34 --> 955.54]  i need massively expandable storage okay uh the cloud local no no the cloud the cloud is the answer to
[955.54 --> 959.94]  everything i need it to be privately secure in fact the cloud is the answer to your gaming too cloud
[959.94 --> 966.90]  gaming cloud storage done i don't i don't accept that um i need to be able to play my games offline
[966.90 --> 973.38]  i need local secure i mean i think we've made our point i mean to to try knew more about what people
[973.38 --> 978.82]  actually use ipads for i'd probably be able to have more arguments i think honestly that's a more
[978.82 --> 983.78]  interesting discussion at this point not what you can't do on an ipad because that's kind of an
[983.78 --> 989.14]  endless topic but what can you do on an ipad i don't use them i literally don't know what you can
[989.14 --> 993.38]  do on you can shop on amazon you can check your email it's all the usual things i mean the main
[993.38 --> 1000.42]  difference here okay and we can use this we can use this to springboard into you know what the ipad pro
[1001.38 --> 1008.02]  is as much as anything else because and our my favorite ipad pro review so far uh is this one over
[1008.02 --> 1013.86]  on over on ars technica where i think the the headline pretty much says it mac like speed with
[1013.86 --> 1021.70]  all the virtues and restrictions of ios because it does bring some interesting new peripherals to the
[1021.70 --> 1028.90]  table there is finally an apple sanctioned official keyboard cover and the similarity to something like
[1028.90 --> 1037.94]  a surface pro type cover is definitely a thing um and they have the pencil which is a stylus
[1038.58 --> 1044.74]  but it is a device apparently you just use an ipad for porn yeah you can use a computer for porn
[1044.74 --> 1049.78]  yeah so so it's one of those things where uh and we'll talk more about steam steam os later but it's
[1049.78 --> 1055.86]  one of those things where i i don't especially with the way that it's priced which is kind of uh beating
[1055.86 --> 1063.62]  down the door of devices like a surface pro 4 and even apple's own macbook lineup um at the kind of
[1063.62 --> 1072.58]  price that it's at i just don't really understand why i'm taking a half-assed keyboard and no trackpad
[1073.38 --> 1081.22]  it does have the pencil so it does have a stylus but it lacks any mouse even any mouse or trackpad input
[1081.22 --> 1088.98]  um i don't understand why i'm giving that up for the sake of i can attach the keyboard i guess
[1090.42 --> 1095.86]  and the screen is bigger i'm trying to watch people talk about what they actually use them for
[1095.86 --> 1101.54]  so far i got keep all my school books in one place which like so it's an ebook or a laptop
[1101.54 --> 1110.10]  okay one of the two yeah um porn yeah your phone yeah um well the screen's pretty small and that's
[1110.10 --> 1119.06]  like it so i mean to me this is not so much a problem with the with with what tim cook is i think
[1119.06 --> 1126.34]  trying to say and that's that the ipad pro is like everything that like uh where's that where's
[1126.34 --> 1132.98]  that other where's that other uh shoot where's that other quote i think this was technically video
[1132.98 --> 1141.14]  edit on an ipad pro yeah so so it's a it's not like no no everything he said is just kind of wrong
[1141.14 --> 1147.86]  he said okay yes the ipad pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many many people
[1147.86 --> 1153.54]  and if you use it within the right narrowed scope yeah so i think to say that for many many people
[1154.50 --> 1159.30]  and apple is oh no okay i shouldn't say apple because i meant the fruit not the company but in
[1159.30 --> 1165.94]  the context of this discussion that could be very confusing to say for many many people a trackpad is
[1165.94 --> 1173.70]  a replacement for the mouse would be true because functionally you can kind of use them for the same
[1173.70 --> 1183.86]  stuff but i and this i've said this before when uh in my macbook 2015 retina review i've got stuff to
[1183.86 --> 1192.10]  do i need a mouse because it's faster and actually objectively better if you've like got stuff to do
[1192.10 --> 1197.54]  if i'm just hanging around watching youtube videos on my computer i don't need a mouse because i'm not
[1197.54 --> 1202.50]  in a hurry i've got all the time in the world and i think that's kind of what's being said here yes the
[1202.50 --> 1209.06]  ipad pro is a replacement for a notebook or desktop for many many people if those people don't really have
[1209.06 --> 1217.94]  anything to do or they're like they need something to sketch on but i i like i don't oh i don't
[1217.94 --> 1224.34]  understand why they're using this instead of like a windows-based wacom tablet which has already existed
[1224.34 --> 1231.14]  for a couple of years for people who legitimately want to use the fully featured adobe creative suite
[1231.14 --> 1240.02]  on a portable device with a legitimately excellent pen and digitizer experience with that said the
[1240.02 --> 1247.06]  overall feedback on apple's pencil stylus seems to be pretty good so far from reviews but they're not
[1247.06 --> 1252.66]  out there in the wilderness and this is really crazy the ipad pro is out but the stylus is delayed
[1252.66 --> 1259.30]  again so you actually would just be buying a big ipad with a keyboard and i mean this is this is another
[1259.30 --> 1263.54]  thing going back to the keyboard like i don't really personally think that an extra couple inches
[1263.54 --> 1270.26]  on the screen no dramatically changes the ios experience enough combined with a keyboard that
[1270.26 --> 1276.90]  this is a game-changing device i mean i personally this is something i think it makes it less usable i
[1277.54 --> 1284.66]  personally went through the experience of back in the ipad 2 days uh logitech and they actually have
[1284.66 --> 1291.54]  a new peripheral for the ipad pro but logitech had a bluetooth keyboard slash hard aluminum cover
[1291.54 --> 1299.06]  really nice accessory for the ipad 2 i personally bought hundreds of them when i worked at ncix i like
[1299.06 --> 1302.50]  busted my butt i was like this thing is going to be a hot mover it takes everything that's great
[1302.50 --> 1307.78]  about the ipad and makes it so you can actually pipe on the damn thing that thing was a disaster
[1307.78 --> 1315.94]  it was so hard for me to get rid of them and so what people have changed their minds that much already
[1315.94 --> 1329.06]  i don't think so um so lots of people talking about oh uh sure oh there's one extra word uh
[1330.66 --> 1337.62]  so okay go for it um so lots of people in the chat are bringing up the horrible horrible horrible
[1337.62 --> 1342.74]  things that happened in paris um yes wait oh are we done with the ipad thing are we completely
[1342.74 --> 1346.10]  changing okay we don't technically have to but we've been talking about it for quite a while yeah
[1346.10 --> 1352.34]  okay so yeah yeah we're done so basically in short uh don't expect an ipad pro review from me because
[1352.34 --> 1358.34]  i don't really care it is not a pc it does not replace a pc it's a big ipad and that'll be good for
[1358.34 --> 1364.34]  some things like in a classroom where a bigger thing to read a storybook to the kids on the ipad might be
[1364.34 --> 1370.82]  nice that's what i think it's for okay anyways um super important super terrible things happening in
[1370.82 --> 1377.46]  paris uh yes we know um we're mainly not addressing it because we're probably not the right people
[1378.02 --> 1384.10]  we're addressing we're still a tech show yes i would it is super important and if you do want
[1384.10 --> 1388.98]  to be informed i would very much recommend going and checking it out i know there's at least two of
[1388.98 --> 1393.86]  the top things on the front page of reddit are about paris right now those are probably good links to go
[1393.86 --> 1398.50]  get yourself informed i'm sure people in chat will probably be able to help you if you're looking
[1398.50 --> 1404.34]  for information um and you'll be able to find it all over the internet it's a huge thing right now
[1404.82 --> 1410.66]  um but yes we are probably not the right people and i feel like if we spoke about it we wouldn't be
[1410.66 --> 1416.42]  adding to the conversation for one and might accidentally spread misinformation which would be
[1416.42 --> 1422.50]  the worst thing to do right now so yeah maybe go check it out there are attacks and paris has closed
[1422.50 --> 1428.74]  their borders um and yeah that's very much a developing developing thing right now so yeah
[1428.74 --> 1434.74]  i think it's safe for us to say you know our hearts go out to the people of paris i love paris that's
[1434.74 --> 1440.02]  actually the the city that i chose that was my grad present as i could go anywhere in the world
[1440.74 --> 1446.90]  for i think it was like 10 days or something like that also i had to take my mother um and i went to
[1446.90 --> 1451.94]  paris and it was freaking awesome and people should not attack paris i think we can all agree on that
[1451.94 --> 1460.90]  yeah all right so moving back to tech news uh intel's sky lake speed shift technology has been
[1461.62 --> 1466.90]  deployed now this is stuff that was built into the cpu back when it was released this was posted on the
[1466.90 --> 1473.54]  forum by numlock 21 uh the article here is from anontech but basically what this amounts to
[1473.54 --> 1483.06]  is a more advanced kind of a more granular version of the of the speed step technology that already
[1483.06 --> 1490.74]  existed that allows the cpu to dynamically adjust its power and speed settings as it's being used so
[1493.78 --> 1502.26]  uh so this is cool so in the past the operating system was fully in control of this process and the cpu
[1502.26 --> 1508.90]  itself was just capable of all these different power states now with operating system support and
[1508.90 --> 1514.82]  this has been added to windows 10 the os can actually hand control of the frequency and voltage
[1514.82 --> 1522.82]  back to the processor so in short there's uh there's an intel provided graph here that graphed excuse me
[1522.82 --> 1529.78]  graph here that shows with speed shift enabled how quickly it can cycle up to different power states so
[1529.78 --> 1536.26]  you can see the i believe this is frequency yep so this is frequency versus time in milliseconds we are
[1536.26 --> 1543.78]  talking getting from uh a low lower power state to the highest one in a matter of what is this like
[1545.94 --> 1553.38]  15 milliseconds or something along those lines that's pretty solid versus about 120 milliseconds without
[1553.38 --> 1559.54]  speed shift enabled so this is going to be particularly important for things like mobile processors
[1559.54 --> 1564.58]  where the difference between your base clock and your very low power steps when you've got speed step
[1564.58 --> 1568.98]  at its very very lowest states to say battery so this is going to make a big difference to the
[1568.98 --> 1574.34]  responsiveness of tasks when that mobile processor that has a huge disparity between its base and its
[1574.34 --> 1580.02]  boost clock is able to quickly go okay you're doing something boom i'm done and oh now i'm way back down so
[1581.30 --> 1589.30]  you know say for example when you're navigating to a web page that puts a very short very sudden very very short
[1589.54 --> 1595.94]  term load on the processor and now that will be able to take better advantage of the actual power
[1595.94 --> 1600.74]  that you've got under the hood of your device than was possible in the past which can give you
[1600.74 --> 1607.30]  responsiveness in little tight timings which can actually make your computer feel a lot faster than it
[1607.30 --> 1614.42]  actually the the change actually is yeah responsiveness is more important than you know how quickly can you
[1614.42 --> 1619.54]  render out you know a video that is going to take either a half an hour or 35 minutes or whatever
[1619.54 --> 1625.30]  which is awesome but like that five minutes will feel like a much shorter period of time than when
[1625.30 --> 1628.98]  because you'll probably go do something yeah um compared to if you're sitting there literally
[1628.98 --> 1633.46]  staring at the screen waiting for something to load so this is cool this tells us a little bit about
[1633.46 --> 1639.30]  it so anontech ran pc mark 8 because somehow they managed to get that bloody program to run i swear like
[1639.30 --> 1646.26]  like and you know what we must just be snake bitten because i love future mark those guys are nice and
[1646.26 --> 1652.82]  i love most of the software that they make but pc mark man every single time people people often ask
[1652.82 --> 1660.42]  me why don't you run pc mark on like your laptop reviews and stuff maybe 10 to 20 maybe 30 of the time
[1660.42 --> 1666.42]  that i've just sat down and gone okay i'm gonna run pc mark it has worked for a while i was actually using
[1666.42 --> 1672.10]  the battery life test in my notebook videos so i i used it in i think two and then i went to use it
[1672.10 --> 1679.14]  for the uh the dell rugged uh laptop and it just three times just it failed just like would stop
[1679.14 --> 1683.70]  working it would just the computer would go to sleep when the device still had 40 battery i'm just like
[1683.70 --> 1688.50]  this is not useful every time we get to scrapyard wars we get to deciding on one of those style of
[1688.50 --> 1694.74]  tests i'm just like uh oh dear we went through what three different versions of pc mark to find one that
[1694.74 --> 1700.98]  to find one that we managed to run and even then i think we oh i'm this is spoilers okay stay tuned
[1700.98 --> 1706.50]  for more scrapyard wars how is it still coming out it's still coming i'm on the fan side on this one
[1706.50 --> 1713.46]  it's way too long you know what it was one of those things where it ended up being a result of us taking
[1713.46 --> 1721.22]  the whole thing and going okay what's good here because a lot of the time stuff that was good enough
[1721.22 --> 1726.02]  to make it into this version ended up on the cutting room floor because of just time constraints
[1726.02 --> 1731.86]  last time so i think the haphazard approach almost worked better the problem was because it was too
[1731.86 --> 1736.98]  light and then last time had its own whole set of problems i know so like we decided on this before
[1736.98 --> 1741.14]  we so we'll reevaluate and we'll take another crack at it and that's pretty much all there is to it
[1741.14 --> 1745.78]  all right um so anyway there's some more benchmarks for speed shift that show that in some cases it does
[1745.78 --> 1752.34]  make a very significant difference uh in other cases it's much smaller um but yeah there you go
[1753.14 --> 1757.54]  battery efficiency ever so slightly improved i love those in on tech guys they do such a good job
[1757.54 --> 1762.66]  this is all good stuff yeah all good stuff it's not it's not a it's i doubt it's gonna be a major
[1762.66 --> 1769.38]  game-changing thing but like it's cool uh what's interesting is that the os can relinquish not
[1769.38 --> 1775.94]  necessarily all but just some of the power state um some of the power states so it could control it
[1775.94 --> 1780.98]  within this range or that range or the whole thing that's cool very cool stuff yeah do you know if
[1780.98 --> 1787.54]  you're gonna have to enable this or is it automatically running that i actually don't know i'm assuming on
[1787.54 --> 1794.18]  the cpu side it's probably enabled by default i suspect it works on its own i cannot tell you the only
[1794.18 --> 1801.06]  thing that made me think of that is because you said it can do this or that all right so this is
[1801.06 --> 1808.74]  interesting i mean this is something where it doesn't look like anyone can get any comment from um
[1810.18 --> 1819.30]  here we go uh from the director of whatever kind of yeah i think it's unlikely that they could have
[1819.30 --> 1827.54]  uh did we intro the topic at all no no we didn't so basically word on the street is that the fbi paid
[1827.54 --> 1836.10]  carnegie mellon one million dollars at least this is all very he said she said to break tour so the
[1836.10 --> 1841.86]  original article that we have here this is posted by dat speed on the forum the original article and uh
[1841.86 --> 1849.30]  there's the full speed uh full-size ad is from forbes here and so the tor project is the one claiming
[1849.30 --> 1857.86]  this um and the the objective they are saying was that was for the fbi to uncloak particular users
[1857.86 --> 1865.06]  and find their true ips so this is the team responsible for maintaining the tor anonymizing
[1865.06 --> 1869.94]  network and they're claiming that they paid one million to disclose techniques that they discovered
[1869.94 --> 1875.46]  that could help uncover the identities of users neither the fbi nor carnegie mellon have directly
[1875.46 --> 1882.02]  confirmed nor denied anything there was a talk uh that was supposed to be a black hat 2014 that was
[1882.02 --> 1887.46]  cancelled um from two researchers their names are in here somewhere that were from carnegie mellon
[1887.46 --> 1893.30]  uh that talk was cancelled and was directly pertaining to these kind of things and people are wondering if
[1893.30 --> 1898.82]  that talk was kind of bought out by the fbi so it wasn't released and then the things that they were
[1898.82 --> 1905.94]  talking about in there were released and that talk was about um being able to un un un anonymize these
[1905.94 --> 1913.38]  people and find the hidden services which is exactly what was done so they do actually seem pretty well related
[1913.38 --> 1924.26]  yep um so i guess that's pretty much all there is to really yeah to really say about it but ed ed i don't know how to say your last name ed desu
[1924.26 --> 1932.02]  does it is ed desu tells the suitels can i help you out tools i can say that name
[1933.70 --> 1939.46]  desu yeah it looks like a french name spokesman for carnegie mellon software engineering institute did not
[1939.46 --> 1944.74]  deny the accusations directly but told wired i would like to see the substantiation for their claim adding
[1944.74 --> 1950.98]  i am not aware of any payment which is like basically like saying i can't say anything yeah
[1951.94 --> 1957.94]  yeah um the site motherboard reviewed the court filings reviewed court filings that proved the fbi
[1957.94 --> 1963.30]  recruited a research institute that was running systems on tor networks to uncover the identity
[1963.30 --> 1969.86]  of a user of silk road 2. so that's the drug marketplace that replaced the first version of the silk road
[1969.86 --> 1979.30]  and um yeah i guess that's pretty much all there is to say about that so nowhere is safe yay yay although
[1979.30 --> 1985.14]  that's why you should run a local cloud unlike that thing you can do on an ipad which is using other
[1985.14 --> 1992.50]  clouds oh wow boy um i guess i i kind of we actually had a separate well you know what it's probably worth
[1992.50 --> 1997.46]  going through we had a separate topic for the ipad pro i did cover a lot of this though when i was kind
[1997.46 --> 2002.42]  of ranting about it before but there are some good things about it ipad pro again bro yeah so this is
[2002.42 --> 2007.70]  supposed to buy dad speed well it's kind of a big deal because it replaces desktops and laptops
[2007.70 --> 2012.98]  that means like our jobs yeah i know right we'll just have to make videos about the ipad pro all day
[2012.98 --> 2014.98]  dude i can put the ipad pro in a bomb
[2014.98 --> 2025.30]  okay that will make more sense if you've watched his fallout 4 build block
[2027.62 --> 2034.66]  yeah um anyway so there is some cool stuff so the a9x processor uh the same one that was found in the
[2034.66 --> 2041.94]  iphone 6s has now been overclocked just another way of saying the clock speed has been increased so
[2041.94 --> 2050.26]  it's now even faster and actually quite competitive with um intel's real processors like we're not
[2050.26 --> 2056.82]  talking core m it's legitimately looking pretty competitive with you know a low-end core i3 core
[2056.82 --> 2062.82]  i5 dual core pretty darn interesting stuff and this is based on some browser-based benchmarks as well as
[2062.82 --> 2069.46]  geekbench it also shows little sign of throttling in the geekbench thermal test pretty darn impressive
[2069.46 --> 2074.66]  and with the larger battery thanks to the larger housing it's able to achieve pretty darn similar
[2074.66 --> 2082.50]  battery life to previous ipads again a very good result the onboard graphics are looking very very
[2082.50 --> 2090.98]  favorable beating every previous i device and every intel gpu up to and including the iris pro 5200
[2090.98 --> 2097.86]  and intel hd 520 it does not feature 3d touch something that i'm personally pretty disappointed in
[2097.86 --> 2106.18]  brutal 3d touch is actually awesome yeah apple's done a pretty good job in the past of of of maintaining
[2106.18 --> 2110.34]  their new features sort of across the product line as they refresh them um and i would have really
[2110.34 --> 2115.78]  expected that and this is especially disappointing given that this is a device that it's so funny
[2115.78 --> 2121.70]  because apple is always running around saying well no touch screens for our macbooks because that's awkward
[2121.70 --> 2130.66]  so this is a device where we're expected to type and touch it yeah um and they're actually taking
[2130.66 --> 2137.46]  away input options from the touch from the touch input multitasking is still quite limited um because
[2137.46 --> 2143.06]  it's running ios it takes around four and a half hours to completely recharge with the included charge
[2143.06 --> 2149.38]  where if not in use um thanks to its high capacity battery and it starts at 800 us dollars
[2149.38 --> 2158.02]  uh the keyboard is 169 for a keyboard accessory and the stylus is a hundred dollars so you've spent
[2158.02 --> 2164.74]  over a thousand dollars by the time you get even a base 32 gig wi-fi model basically i wouldn't
[2164.74 --> 2170.26]  recommend buying it um i've had some pretty i've given some pretty positive reviews to apple devices in
[2170.26 --> 2176.18]  the last little while um including the iphone 6s but this one really great on the phone side especially
[2176.18 --> 2181.54]  with and like part of the reason why they're doing so great is that android is just doing terribly
[2182.10 --> 2188.74]  in terms of like security stuff yeah security stuff uh os updates um customer support there's
[2188.74 --> 2194.10]  a lot of things wrong with android right now um i'm super pleased with my new phone uh those of you
[2194.10 --> 2199.14]  who aren't following on vessel won't know this yet but i have officially switched to the xperia z5
[2199.14 --> 2204.42]  compact i have done away with the droid turbo it has officially happened after 11 months
[2204.98 --> 2209.38]  like you're actually gonna switch that's done wow i'm done i'm done with the droid turbo i think
[2209.38 --> 2214.02]  terran wants to buy it so that would be a good upgrade for terran yeah yeah he needs uh he needs
[2214.02 --> 2218.98]  a phone with a camera that works so the droid turbo is definitely that all right let's move on to some
[2218.98 --> 2226.34]  intel news the broadwell e upcoming broadwell e specifications have been leaked this was posted by
[2226.34 --> 2234.10]  mr troll on the forum whose name is appropriate given that it's a news item on ltd forum linking to
[2234.10 --> 2243.78]  wccf tech so there's actually if this is true and what i will give wccf tech and many of the other
[2243.78 --> 2251.86]  rumor mill sites out there what i will give them is that typically intel cpu rumors tend to be pretty
[2251.86 --> 2261.30]  good um intel is a very very structured company and generally speaking their roadmaps like back when
[2261.30 --> 2269.30]  i was working at a retailer the their roadmaps are pretty far out and like if if if they are if they
[2269.30 --> 2277.46]  are going to be arriving i think what was it q1 2016 uh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[2277.46 --> 2287.86]  later in 2016. later in 2016. so the uh the broadwell ep zeons are rumored for q1 2016 with the consumer
[2287.86 --> 2294.02]  grade ones coming i think it was later in 2016. so it would not be unlike intel to have a year out
[2294.02 --> 2298.50]  roadmap that they're showing potential partners under nda but of course how long does it take for
[2298.50 --> 2305.38]  wccf tech to get their hands on that so in a nutshell we are looking at once again man it seems like
[2305.38 --> 2312.42]  it took forever for them to get past giving us six cores on that platform but we are getting another
[2312.42 --> 2317.62]  two cores for the top end extreme edition cool freaking stuff one of the coolest parts though is
[2317.62 --> 2323.94]  that you can get an eight core non-extreme edition yes so the top end thousand dollar processor is
[2323.94 --> 2332.50]  rumored to be rocking 10 cores and 20 threads at 3 gigahertz so uh we're looking at a basically
[2332.50 --> 2338.74]  equivalent single threaded performance in all likelihood with essentially in heavily multi-threaded
[2338.74 --> 2344.50]  workloads that's three gigahertz uh non-turbo yeah non-turbo and we don't know the turbo and we don't
[2344.50 --> 2350.34]  know turbo clocks um so effectively whatever sort of 25 performance improvement in heavily threaded
[2350.34 --> 2355.14]  workloads not bad from generation to generation heck of a lot better than the consumer stuff
[2355.78 --> 2363.14]  yay we're getting treated like enthusiasts again um and then this is even more interesting sort of
[2363.14 --> 2367.86]  except that we don't know pricing yet and that is that of the so the 6950x is the extreme edition the
[2367.86 --> 2375.14]  6900k is apparently going to have eight cores and 16 threads yeah so you won't have to buy an extreme
[2375.14 --> 2379.22]  edition to get the eight core experience which is awesome but again yeah we don't know the price tag
[2379.22 --> 2384.18]  we don't know the price probably pretty easy to guess well i would have said that except that this
[2384.18 --> 2391.54]  time around intel is going to have four skews in the enthusiast stack so for the last couple of
[2391.54 --> 2401.78]  generations like three generations 3960x and then it was 3930k 3820k then we had the 4960x 4930k
[2401.78 --> 2411.70]  4920k and in both of those cases i believe they were all it was six core eight four core four core
[2411.70 --> 2416.34]  no six core six core four core i think something along those lines anyway so this time we get 10 core
[2416.34 --> 2422.26]  four okay so right so 5960x is eight core and then both of the lower ones are six core right there
[2422.26 --> 2427.78]  was no cheap quad core previously that's right they were they were six cores or uh or that sorry
[2427.78 --> 2433.86]  there's the cheap one is not a quad core this time uh six core six core so this time you get a 10 core
[2433.86 --> 2439.78]  or an eight core and then there is no quad core very nice so you get definitely something for your
[2439.78 --> 2446.18]  money investing in an x99 motherboard and quad core memory uh quad core quad channel memory so this
[2446.18 --> 2452.02]  time you definitely get at least two more cores for your money and you could get up to also six
[2452.66 --> 2461.14]  or eight or 10. but we don't know what the pricing is going to look like and i wouldn't be that surprised
[2461.14 --> 2468.10]  to see intel pull another q6600 on us here so back when they launched their first quad core extreme
[2468.10 --> 2475.94]  edition the qx 6700 what happened was they initially launched the q6600 which was their first non-extreme
[2475.94 --> 2483.30]  quad core at like 750 or something like that like it was quite expensive so i wouldn't be surprised
[2483.30 --> 2491.06]  to see that and then another lower end six core with kind of the other six core sitting in between
[2491.06 --> 2499.38]  that massive price gap that now exists between the 5820k and the 5930k and the other thing we don't know
[2499.38 --> 2506.42]  yet here is how pci express lanes are going to be handled so right now while we do get a six a six or
[2506.42 --> 2511.22]  an eight core regardless of how much we spend that bottom tier six core instead of having two fewer
[2511.22 --> 2518.18]  cores has 12 fewer pci e lanes for worse expansion if you want to add a bunch of a bunch of cards to it
[2518.18 --> 2528.10]  so what i'm guessing is we're going to see that low end 6800k be six cores and fewer pci e lanes i think
[2528.10 --> 2533.22]  we're going to get a six core with all the pci e lanes in between like that new one that didn't
[2533.22 --> 2537.22]  exist before that new price point then we're going to have eight cores with all lanes then we're going
[2537.22 --> 2542.18]  to have 10 cores with all lanes um so that's that's kind of what it looks like to me
[2544.26 --> 2552.42]  i'm really super stoked on broadwell ep though as some of you probably know i have been getting i've been
[2552.42 --> 2559.38]  getting more and more into xeon stuff and like enjoying all the cores and you know whether it's
[2559.38 --> 2565.06]  using them for our video editing workflow or whether it's using them for running virtual machines where
[2565.06 --> 2570.90]  we took two two gamers running on one motherboard which is pretty freaking cool um so this is this
[2570.90 --> 2576.50]  is looking interesting and this uh the official launch is apparently targeted for q1 2016 so this is
[2576.50 --> 2588.98]  e5 2600v4 up to 22 cores and 44 threads with up to 55 megabytes of cash per chip holy actual freaking
[2588.98 --> 2597.70]  balls not to mention that memory speed goes up from 2133 to 2400 so we're talking a dual socket machine with
[2597.70 --> 2605.70]  up to 44 cores i mean i thought it was bananas when we did our 36 core machine i wonder what excuse i could
[2605.70 --> 2614.10]  find to tell intel that i need 222 cores i'm gonna have to come up with something wait don't you already
[2614.10 --> 2621.54]  have this no i've got 218 course what about that oh no those are okay so i do have okay so i've been
[2621.54 --> 2627.78]  teasing this for a bit okay we're changing topics a little bit here so without revealing too much
[2628.58 --> 2634.74]  i'm going to be building a very interesting machine um it will contain keep going i'm just
[2634.74 --> 2646.18]  seven seven r9 fury nanos it will contain two 14 core zeons it will contain 256 gigabytes of memory
[2646.74 --> 2652.10]  and it's all going to be on an asus workstation motherboard uh the rest of the specs are sort of
[2652.10 --> 2657.86]  tbd right now um because if i i think if i said anything about the rest of what i'm putting in it might
[2657.86 --> 2664.18]  reveal too much about the project but expect that project to show up probably sometime around the end of
[2664.18 --> 2669.30]  this year because let me tell you it takes a little while to get all of that hardware coordinated and
[2669.30 --> 2673.46]  it's going to take a fair bit of testing and configuration for me to get this whole thing
[2673.46 --> 2679.78]  working so my cpus are here the ram arrived today the video cards are due next wednesday and the
[2679.78 --> 2685.38]  motherboard is asus doesn't communicate i just kind of go hey i need this motherboard and then like
[2685.94 --> 2690.74]  three weeks later it shows up in the mail and i'm like okay hey we got it awesome we'll do that
[2690.74 --> 2697.78]  project now um so stay tuned for that speaking of stay tuned stay tuned for our sponsors linda.com

[2914.34 --> 2921.22]  massively outdated i know i know it's like shoot is so i know so what else do we do wow oh dear
[2921.22 --> 2927.62]  an unboxing we straight up don't even do them anymore actually you know what do we do any of these things
[2928.18 --> 2931.94]  so we no longer do commercial production yeah i don't remember the last time we did one
[2931.94 --> 2939.70]  me neither we don't do unboxings we do do reviews we do do event coverage although this overclocking
[2939.70 --> 2946.10]  event was a long time ago yeah uh we do do sponsored projects things like our the fallout 3 build that
[2946.10 --> 2951.86]  you follow excuse me fallout 4 build blog you just did shots fired and okay how many of these do we
[2951.86 --> 2958.02]  still work with it's been a long time for steel series we haven't worked with samsung in over a year
[2958.02 --> 2964.50]  we haven't worked with linksys since their very first sponsorship of our trip to ces three years
[2964.50 --> 2972.34]  ago uh we definitely don't work with hotspot shield anymore in fact that brings us very tidally into
[2972.34 --> 2980.18]  our next sponsor tunnelbear yeah there were a number of reasons actually there are a number of reasons
[2980.18 --> 2987.30]  whenever we drop a sponsor that we end up doing it yes one of them is related to complaints from our
[2987.30 --> 2992.18]  viewers when we get complaints we don't work with our sponsor anymore unless they have a really good
[2992.18 --> 2997.94]  reason or unless they address it very well so start browsing today privately at tunnelbear.com

[3049.22 --> 3055.38]  256-bit encryption so i guess that's pretty much all there is to say it's super easy to use and if

[3074.74 --> 3079.38]  uh the rest of the show here what what else are we supposed to talk about today i don't even know
[3079.38 --> 3084.66]  there's pokemon oh yeah pokemon there's your tax rebellion thing no this is actually okay this is
[3084.66 --> 3088.74]  really interesting okay he hasn't read this but i believe you this is by posted by trickstarry on the
[3088.74 --> 3096.58]  forum of course it was our resident our resident of tinfoil hatware this is such a topic for you i know no it's
[3096.58 --> 3100.42]  actually no it's it's it's legitimately pretty interesting so no i'm just saying this just
[3101.06 --> 3106.98]  it smells like so the welsh town crick howell which is a great name for a town by the way moves
[3107.54 --> 3116.02]  offshore to avoid tax what on local business what okay so this is led by some traders including the
[3116.02 --> 3124.10]  town's salmon smokery local coffee shop bookshop optician and bakery what and this tax rebellion
[3124.10 --> 3133.38]  could spread nationwide now it it's important to be very clear what they are doing they are not
[3133.38 --> 3140.18]  trying to evade taxes for the sake of evading taxes they uh uh said blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[3140.18 --> 3146.66]  up until now blah blah blah blah etc etc etc okay i can't find the quote that that i was reading uh but but
[3146.66 --> 3154.42]  basically that is not the point the these are these are these are people who presumably at least some
[3154.42 --> 3159.94]  of them okay proudly pay their taxes to support their country and the public services that they use
[3160.50 --> 3166.82]  i pay a lot of taxes personally and through the business i pay lots and lots of taxes because i've
[3166.82 --> 3172.26]  been working since i was legal age to work with absolutely zero interruptions having always paid my
[3172.26 --> 3177.86]  taxes and i am proud of that i am proud to support the social programs that we have here in canada
[3177.86 --> 3182.66]  that take that tax money that i pay and build a road that not only i can drive on but everyone can
[3182.66 --> 3189.78]  drive on that is the way the system is supposed to work is the system broken yes the system is broken
[3189.78 --> 3194.98]  there are many many significant issues in canada and in many other countries pretty much everywhere
[3194.98 --> 3200.10]  there are many significant issues that exist with the way that taxpayer money gets spent oh yeah but
[3200.10 --> 3205.46]  it's a heck of a lot better than anarchy and so i continue to support it happily and i do not go
[3205.46 --> 3210.90]  out of my way to evade any taxes and i'm proud of that so that's not what these guys are doing either
[3211.54 --> 3218.66]  their point and this is this is great one of the town's traders discovered that he paid seven times
[3218.66 --> 3229.06]  more in corporation tax last year than facebook which paid five thousand pounds in corporation tax
[3229.70 --> 3239.62]  that is their point their point is if this loophole is here then fine we're gonna use it and you got
[3239.62 --> 3244.98]  two options option number one is okay well we're gonna play by those rules and we don't pay taxes
[3244.98 --> 3252.82]  anymore we pay very very small offshore company taxes or option number two is tax those guys they
[3252.82 --> 3260.74]  should be paying tax too um they super should and it's so this loophole uh allowed the likes of amazon
[3260.74 --> 3269.94]  to pay 11.9 million on 5.3 billion of uk internet sales yeah amazon.co.uk is sort of a big site i think
[3269.94 --> 3278.50]  that's worded oddly i think they're paying taxes on 11.9 million of 5.3 billion of sales what no taxes of
[3278.50 --> 3283.86]  11.9 million on 5.3 billion of sales okay yeah yeah that's right don't don't worry it's it's all good
[3284.58 --> 3290.82]  um i don't know what i don't know what ghost is doing he's drunk okay that's why i was assuming
[3290.82 --> 3296.98]  there was something wrong anyway the point is um what joe carthu who runs the local smokery said
[3296.98 --> 3302.90]  is that until now complicated offshore tricks have only been open to big companies who can afford the
[3302.90 --> 3310.10]  lawyers fees now we've worked out a way to mimic them and they're basically uh this is going to be
[3310.10 --> 3315.78]  a part of a documentary in 2016 as part of bbc britain's black economy season and they're basically
[3315.78 --> 3322.74]  going okay here's how to do it so we're starting tax rebellion if you want to collect any taxes from
[3322.74 --> 3327.86]  businesses maybe it's time to start collecting taxes from everyone in a fair and equitable manner
[3327.86 --> 3336.74]  i love it this article made me so happy because it makes absolutely no sense that these companies
[3336.74 --> 3343.06]  are gonna are gonna you know threaten threaten the government and go oh well we'll just we'll just
[3343.06 --> 3348.34]  like stop paying our lobbying dollars and we'll just we'll move our operations out if you make us
[3348.34 --> 3357.54]  paid taxes i realistically i don't see that happening but it takes it takes multiple governments
[3357.54 --> 3364.26]  forming a united front against this behavior in order to make it work and so i i do sincerely worry
[3364.26 --> 3370.74]  that it might not be possible i don't know i don't know because it's i mean yeah if you're if you're
[3370.74 --> 3377.94]  apple is it cheaper for you to pay tax properly on all your income or is it cheaper for you to offer
[3377.94 --> 3384.98]  the entirety of your silicon valley campuses a massive relocation bonus to move to canada or move to
[3384.98 --> 3392.34]  somewhere else yeah i i don't know like i don't know i don't know how far this would escalate
[3392.34 --> 3396.34]  before it ended and i don't know what the landscape would look like when it was over
[3397.46 --> 3404.98]  um oh this is this is actually i have to confess i had not heard of this so this was posted on the
[3404.98 --> 3411.38]  forum by oh no i don't have a forum post this is just an ars technica link so beware of ads that use
[3411.38 --> 3418.98]  inaudible sound to link your phone tv tablet and pc so privacy advocates warn the feds about
[3418.98 --> 3426.18]  surreptious cross device tracking this is some crappy stuff going on right here yeah and i hadn't
[3426.18 --> 3433.62]  heard of this before if if you're running software on a smart device so basically as far as i can tell
[3433.62 --> 3438.50]  that's anything that can have an app installed on it that can have silver push software running at the
[3438.50 --> 3444.74]  same time yeah um that would be able to listen so a microphone of some sort so probably your phone
[3444.74 --> 3451.86]  or a tablet but probably your phone um then that silver push software can be the audio beacon and
[3451.86 --> 3456.50]  different devices in your house so your computer if you have speakers on it your tv most likely in
[3456.50 --> 3461.94]  the middle of a commercial can have yes uh would be playing extremely high pitched noises i'd be
[3461.94 --> 3465.86]  interested to see if that's a frequency that dogs can hear yeah i wonder if the dogs freak out when they
[3465.86 --> 3471.46]  your dog would be like you're being spied up like yeah yeah exactly your dog's like no dog meat will
[3471.46 --> 3477.54]  save you um anyways follow for reference um it's gonna play this crazy sound that you can't hear
[3477.54 --> 3483.38]  but that your smart device that has silver push software on could kind of pick it up so that they
[3483.38 --> 3489.46]  can track if people are seeing these things yeah so this will tell advertisers oh man this will tell
[3489.46 --> 3496.42]  data miners so much more about you personally than was possible before because i mean we talked
[3496.42 --> 3501.70]  about this let's talk about the ipad pro again there's certain things that make sense to do on a
[3501.70 --> 3509.06]  tablet and there's certain things that don't make sense to do on a tablet so for example if an advertiser
[3509.06 --> 3514.74]  uh let's say let's say oh i don't know let's say google okay let's say you don't use chrome on your desktop
[3514.74 --> 3521.30]  but you use chrome on your ipad so if all that google knows about you is that you uh read game
[3521.30 --> 3528.98]  reviews and you go to porn hub then they'll go okay gamer porn enthusiast and they might you know
[3528.98 --> 3534.26]  try to figure out based on some you know uh emails you send here and there how old you are and what
[3534.26 --> 3538.42]  your gender is and all that kind of stuff so they've created a profile for you but what they might not
[3538.42 --> 3545.86]  know about you is that you watch um yeah and win that you love watching mad men on tv and that you're
[3545.86 --> 3552.26]  whether or not you mute the ads that's right whether so so there's all these things that they
[3552.26 --> 3557.30]  that they can't know about you unless they know all about your devices and the example given in the
[3557.30 --> 3563.78]  ars technica article which was excellent was maybe you would research stds on your computer and then
[3563.78 --> 3570.26]  search for a um you know an you know a a a a sexual health clinic on your phone and then you would
[3570.26 --> 3576.34]  travel there and come back and then like now all of a sudden it could go okay you had an std you went
[3576.34 --> 3581.30]  and got treated and now you're back home and maybe you're better now or maybe you're not and it can
[3581.30 --> 3587.22]  continue to track your searches like being able to track you across devices raises some serious privacy
[3587.22 --> 3593.54]  concerns um especially because tracking you across devices tells them exactly who you are there's
[3593.54 --> 3600.82]  pretty much no way to anonymously submit data like i went here i went there i live here um it's not
[3600.82 --> 3606.18]  it's not anonymous anymore and this is the scariest thing about it silver pushes software is used by 67
[3606.18 --> 3612.42]  apps and which we don't know what those apps are but totals 18 million smartphones yeah and they've
[3612.42 --> 3618.90]  basically what they basically said is it is against our policy to disclose what apps are using our technology
[3618.90 --> 3627.46]  so rip so any app that asks for your microphone and speaker permissions potentially i don't know
[3628.10 --> 3637.94]  any of 67 apps dun dun dun yeah all right original poster here is tangra and the original article is
[3637.94 --> 3644.26]  from ars technica once again i love ars technica so this is so funny this is so funny i called this on
[3644.26 --> 3652.18]  wanshow last week i was like it will take no time flat for the linux army to attack my steam machine
[3652.18 --> 3658.02]  review and tell me about how i'm missing the point because you can enable desktop mode and the blah blah
[3658.02 --> 3664.18]  blah linux master race etc um so it took like a matter of minutes and i actually tweeted about it when it
[3664.18 --> 3671.14]  happened but someone said something along the lines of oh crap anyway one of their points was that linux game
[3671.14 --> 3676.18]  performance and steam os game performance is actually very similar to windows when i used the
[3676.18 --> 3682.50]  word significant performance tax or significant performance penalty or something along those lines
[3682.50 --> 3688.82]  um a that wasn't my point in the video at all because what i was really talking about was the steam
[3688.82 --> 3697.14]  machines uh how successful the steam machine was at targeting the demographic that valve seems to be
[3697.14 --> 3702.82]  targeting with it so it was completely i didn't even run any performance numbers and you're wrong about
[3702.82 --> 3708.26]  the other thing because whether it's linux we're talking about or whether it is driver issues the
[3708.26 --> 3712.18]  performance tax so they were saying there was no performance tax or it wasn't significant the word i
[3712.18 --> 3718.74]  used was significant which has a very specific meaning by the way um it is significant middle earth
[3718.74 --> 3726.26]  shadow of mordor ouch huge that's so brutal um so whether it's drivers actually i thought there were oh yeah
[3726.26 --> 3732.34]  no there are more uh middle earth shadow of mordor the medium settings one or actually ultra settings
[3732.34 --> 3735.22]  is very interesting but i don't know how many people are going to run it on that because it brings it
[3735.22 --> 3740.42]  from a very playable frame rate to a not very playable frame rate but the one that i like looking at the
[3740.42 --> 3746.90]  most is medium because it brings it from a probably above your monitor's refresh rate which is great to
[3746.90 --> 3755.94]  not to definitely not yeah and even valve zone games with portal falling behind by like 30 percent are not
[3755.94 --> 3763.46]  running on par and the blame is probably in some cases probably the game developer but in many
[3763.46 --> 3770.74]  cases probably not and the blame probably falls mostly with the graphics card makers but the cold hard
[3770.74 --> 3776.42]  truth is hold on i'm gonna see if i can find a source for this one of my favorite things okay this is a
[3776.42 --> 3781.14]  little bit unrelated but metro last light redux and then they go to maximum settings and it's like
[3781.14 --> 3790.66]  like doesn't run great on anything unfortunately because it's super hard to run 9.5 to 4.5 yeah
[3790.66 --> 3795.62]  unfortunately i can't find a source for it but so i'm not going to give the number but someone was
[3795.62 --> 3801.70]  telling me that they had heard uh they'd heard amd say something along the lines of uh that the the the
[3801.70 --> 3808.74]  the linux driver download percentage was very very very like lower than you'd think very very low the
[3808.74 --> 3815.70]  people who actually desire to run discrete graphics cards and linux is is very very low and i was
[3815.70 --> 3824.10]  really excited um i i was actually like really really excited by steam os when i first heard about it
[3824.10 --> 3833.86]  two years ago oh yeah okay yeah yeah yeah so i and and valves like valves conviction um in their in their
[3834.82 --> 3843.38]  in their movement to to bring gaming to a more open platform and and i still admire valve's commitment
[3843.38 --> 3848.90]  um to bring their titles and to encourage other developers to bring their own titles to steam os to
[3848.90 --> 3856.74]  run on linux natively and and what's what's cool is for most gamers remember most gamers are still running
[3856.74 --> 3864.58]  1080p or lower okay so most gamers with decent hardware and remember they could afford a hundred
[3864.58 --> 3870.50]  extra dollars on a graphics card potentially if they don't buy windows so there goes your performance
[3870.50 --> 3876.66]  tax right there you just buy better hardware potentially so most gamers running at 1080p um are
[3876.66 --> 3884.58]  not going to are not going to demand the kinds of experiences that for now things like vr or multi-monitor
[3884.58 --> 3888.90]  multi-monitor affinity gaming like some of those things that just don't work on linux due to driver support
[3888.90 --> 3894.02]  right now they're not going to need them and and there and there is potential for that movement to continue
[3894.02 --> 3903.30]  one one thing about the driver download stat is i'm not super great at linux i use it fairly often but i'm actually
[3903.30 --> 3909.78]  not super great at it um i i think it's hard to say that you're super great at linux to be completely
[3909.78 --> 3918.82]  fair um non-official driver packs are very very very common yep and the included drivers are generally
[3918.82 --> 3926.74]  better yeah so like so the amd statistic might not be accurate because they're very probably using
[3926.74 --> 3934.02]  something else some i think mesa is a popular common one uh but i could super be wrong but i
[3934.02 --> 3938.82]  don't know but like you use other things to control your stuff that's one of the reasons why people like
[3938.82 --> 3943.78]  linux but that ties in really well with the end of my point which is as much as i admire valve's effort
[3943.78 --> 3950.10]  and i i hope for success for linux gaming in general i don't think steam os is the answer because
[3950.10 --> 3955.94]  steam os is an arrow with no bullseye to move towards like it doesn't know what it's targeting it
[3955.94 --> 3962.42]  thinks it's targeting mainstream gamers but like then it throws a controller at you that not only
[3962.42 --> 3968.66]  is different from any controller you've ever held but requires you to completely rebind everything in
[3968.66 --> 3974.42]  order to even play games a process that can be done and is no problem for a power user i was able to
[3974.42 --> 3980.42]  figure it out it was no big deal and it's very versatile but joe xbox gamer i mean if it's more
[3980.42 --> 3985.62]  complicated than like oh cool a magnetic d-pad alternative it's not happening it's not
[3985.62 --> 3991.22]  happening so and to be completely honest sometimes i feel like being a power user and sometimes i'd be
[3991.22 --> 3995.54]  like yeah i want to configure this to be like exactly how i want to run for this exact game
[3995.54 --> 4001.46]  and sometimes yeah but if i'm gonna play like dirt showdown yeah exactly i do not want i want to plug
[4001.46 --> 4006.66]  in my controller and i never even want to open up the controller sub menu i want to click race race race
[4006.66 --> 4013.38]  quick race go yeah that's it yeah because i feel like vegging that's why i'm playing a game yeah sometimes
[4013.38 --> 4018.50]  yeah i'm gonna want to tinker but i don't want to have to tinker and certain gaming experiences are
[4018.50 --> 4024.42]  worth the effort of tinkering quite frankly it's just that for me like a racing game or like a third
[4024.42 --> 4029.14]  a third person exploring game is that's when i'm just like chilling and it's it's all my brain can
[4029.14 --> 4034.74]  do to solve whatever lara croft's breast physics puzzle of the day is or whatever else um
[4034.74 --> 4043.70]  some of you have been asking about these shirts we're wearing so it's uh teespring.com when christmas
[4043.70 --> 4049.30]  and you can get it in a variety of colors we actually went out of our way to choose ugly colors
[4049.86 --> 4055.22]  so um that's kind of the point it's kind of the point they're called ugly christmas sweaters
[4055.22 --> 4059.94]  yep now to be clear they are not sweaters they're just t-shirt or they're excuse me they're just sweatshirts
[4059.94 --> 4063.94]  yeah but uh they're ugly what's the difference between a sweater and a sweatshirt a sweater is
[4063.94 --> 4065.22]  woven oh
[4068.90 --> 4077.70]  i had no idea yeah that actually makes a ton of sense um pokemon generation one coming into the 3ds
[4077.70 --> 4081.14]  there's an announcement video you guys can check that out if you're into that sort of thing and
[4081.14 --> 4086.74]  that's literally all there's to say on that topic we don't know uh there's been speculation as to
[4086.74 --> 4091.22]  whether or not i guess there is more to say on that topic yeah there's lots to say about it actually
[4091.22 --> 4094.90]  there's been speculation as to whether or not the the old bugs will be in there because there
[4094.90 --> 4100.50]  was a lot of them and i don't mean like bug type pokemon i mean like the mystic no and and all
[4101.14 --> 4108.98]  that kind of stuff you like that um yeah i like that i don't know because i i as far as my knowledge
[4108.98 --> 4114.42]  goes a lot of those have to do with how things were stored in memory so i don't know if that's going
[4114.42 --> 4119.46]  to translate properly because these are virtual console titles for the 3ds yeah but if you're
[4119.46 --> 4129.14]  emulating the game boy then you could potentially emulate i have never emulated red or blue have you
[4129.14 --> 4133.86]  have you tried any of the bugs i did not own a game boy or game boy color i have definitely played
[4133.86 --> 4140.42]  through pokemon blue i own two advances i don't own an advanced never did oh wow i i owned an original a
[4140.42 --> 4147.38]  color and two advances i don't like i don't maybe the chat will know if you emulate it or the bug's
[4147.38 --> 4156.02]  still there okay brandon knows apparently and when you do emulate it the bugs are still there so maybe
[4156.02 --> 4165.30]  it'll work good job brandon thanks brandon uh okay okay mystic no definitely works apparently so hopefully
[4165.30 --> 4170.18]  they don't screw with anything but they're fixing some stuff so you can wirelessly trade pokemon now
[4170.90 --> 4177.06]  is that a fix well it's a new feature because you have to use the stupid link cable yeah but that's
[4177.06 --> 4181.62]  just connecting that's connectivity of the device that's that's the feature upgrade in my mind i don't
[4181.62 --> 4186.10]  know if that translates to the game or if that's just connectivity to the device yeah well either way
[4186.10 --> 4190.98]  that's because it's it's an improved experiment it's it improves the experience i still have a link
[4190.98 --> 4198.34]  cable of course you do so red blue and yellow are launching and uh there you go it is uh yeah
[4198.34 --> 4202.90]  february 27th 2016 release i'm not quite sure why it's taking so long but uh given that
[4204.50 --> 4207.70]  emulated pokemon red blue and yellow have existed for a long time
[4208.90 --> 4215.62]  in the like a really long time performance yeah like like going back to my uh my napster days
[4215.62 --> 4223.46]  um yeah yeah i think we talked about that um you know what i is sort of is unrelated to this but
[4223.46 --> 4229.70]  i kind of wanted to touch on apparently they're doing an hd remake of twilight princess yeah are you
[4229.70 --> 4237.94]  for real that game how old is twilight princess like six years old i have to look it up twilight
[4237.94 --> 4243.46]  princess blah blah blah blah blah blah wikipedia thank you that's the original wii like it's not
[4243.46 --> 4255.70]  2006 what i played twilight princess nine years ago whoa we both just got a really old moment i think
[4258.02 --> 4264.26]  whoa i didn't even consider that like a collector game for me i have it at home i didn't think
[4266.34 --> 4273.38]  huh we should move on so we don't feel so old again i was i was good oh wow crap on netlink daily
[4273.38 --> 4278.82]  on the ncix channel i was like ripping into them about doing hd remakes of a game that would have
[4278.82 --> 4285.46]  been hd if the freaking console had had any decent hardware in it which is still true by the way
[4286.90 --> 4295.06]  that's so brutal but i really oh i didn't realize it wasn't that old oh my goodness um t-mobile is
[4295.06 --> 4302.90]  apparently going to let you stream some video for free another bold move so they're calling it binge on
[4302.90 --> 4310.26]  man does he not look like some kind of serial rapist in every picture i was maybe not gonna go that route
[4312.42 --> 4318.18]  but he's the serial rapist i love that's for sure oh wow okay whatever look at him
[4318.18 --> 4328.90]  he's doing some stuff look at that scary face uh um other stuff happened in the news uh evga's look at him
[4328.90 --> 4336.26]  970 fallout 4 edition which is probably a little late and stuff but the backplate's pretty cool
[4337.06 --> 4343.06]  um we should talk more about the t-mobile thing actually it's not so youtube unfortunately not
[4343.06 --> 4349.70]  included neither is twitch they did say they are working with youtube but netflix hulu showtime vessel
[4350.34 --> 4356.90]  hey uh hbo go and sling tv are supported i went to the vessel offices last weekend oh yeah how was that
[4356.90 --> 4366.98]  some freaking cool people and they have a cool modern office we don't our office is functional we
[4367.78 --> 4373.06]  we have a cool office it doesn't feel very modern once you walk into the vessel offices
[4373.70 --> 4381.78]  their space is amazing yeah there's silicon valley though yeah yeah we feel very like where we are and
[4381.78 --> 4389.86]  they feel very like where they are it's like linus media group pragmatism
[4392.18 --> 4399.54]  it's like we have cool stuff but it's cool stuff with a purpose yeah pretty much across the board
[4401.14 --> 4405.46]  their stuff has a purpose i just mean like like they have the flat floor with everybody on it
[4405.46 --> 4412.34]  yeah yeah like the only rooms are are meeting rooms and then like the the the entrance area is like
[4412.34 --> 4417.38]  large and they have extensive places to put like bikes and stuff and there's a ping pong table and
[4417.38 --> 4421.94]  they have a large probably a couple of electric car charging ports outside yeah they have a large
[4421.94 --> 4426.50]  kitchen which is stocked with like snack food and drinks if you need it there's a hey we have a large
[4426.50 --> 4429.30]  kitchen stocked with snack food i don't put the snack food in it
[4429.30 --> 4436.74]  yeah i don't know their office was cool they're actually super cool yeah i had a really cool talk
[4436.74 --> 4442.34]  with them um so sorry back to the t-mobile thing i wasn't damn it i wasn't done with that so it is
[4442.34 --> 4447.06]  it is it is speculated that the reason that the uncapped video streaming is only offered on certain
[4447.06 --> 4452.98]  services is that it requires some back-end work to compress the data so that you know t-mobile isn't
[4452.98 --> 4458.50]  going to be stuck with the bill for putting a bunch of 1080p freaking youtube videos all over the place
[4459.30 --> 4464.50]  um so so the idea is that it will be optimized for a small screen which makes a whole ton of sense
[4465.06 --> 4469.78]  um that's really cool that vessel supported i guess it kind of makes sense because it looks like
[4469.78 --> 4476.58]  hulu is also supported and vessel is the former uh former founder i believe or ceo at least of hulu
[4476.58 --> 4484.58]  yeah um which is kind of cool because like i just kind of chat with him sometimes and he was in the
[4484.58 --> 4489.06]  meeting yeah it's like he's a super smart dude he's super down-to-earth guy super smart
[4489.06 --> 4495.38]  guy and it's just like i i kind of forget when i'm talking to him that he's probably a multi-bajillionaire
[4495.94 --> 4502.02]  he's also like a big deal at amazon at some point yeah and stuff one of those like serial startup
[4502.02 --> 4509.22]  people um it's really funny a lot of people on our forum underestimate the number of people watching
[4509.22 --> 4514.82]  our videos on vessel and the impact that vessel has had on our business and underestimate vessel's
[4514.82 --> 4521.62]  chances at continued survival they are not stupid they are not new and they are not going away so
[4521.62 --> 4528.42]  yeah there's a little tidbit for you um i guess that's pretty much it you need to do a shout out
[4528.42 --> 4542.42]  for desertbus.org yeah okay where's the notes for that uh uh uh november 14th so tomorrow um desert bus
[4542.42 --> 4549.54]  for hope is a charity marathon for some of you today yeah actually in europe but this is pst time so
[4550.42 --> 4555.62]  no it is pacific daylight time or wait no it is pacific standard time damn it yes it's standard time
[4555.62 --> 4561.22]  right now right yeah okay i think so i don't yeah yeah minus eight minus eight gmt right yeah okay
[4561.22 --> 4565.54]  um loading ready run is doing their desert bus for hope charity marathon which they've been doing for
[4565.54 --> 4575.06]  a long time where they play desert bus which is the worst most boring game careful yeah that's why i
[4575.06 --> 4580.10]  stopped maybe not the worst about buses driving through a desert it's it's pretty rough because there's
[4580.10 --> 4586.74]  some pretty bad games up there yes um the the bus i i don't remember if it either veers left or right
[4586.74 --> 4592.34]  but it slowly veers one direction so you have to just keep making it go straight but i think it auto
[4592.34 --> 4598.42]  goes for you and if you screw up you have to restart the whole thing and it's just it's it's ridiculous
[4598.42 --> 4604.26]  they're hilarious it's tons of fun to watch it's starting at 10 a.m pst saturday november 14th their
[4604.26 --> 4609.54]  charity website is just desertbus.org it's on the screen check it out support cool people doing cool stuff
[4610.10 --> 4618.02]  okay um on the subject of cool people doing cool stuff i have done it not me i didn't do anything
[4618.02 --> 4624.74]  cool um but what i did do is i put together a list of the cool people and the cool things that they did
[4624.74 --> 4630.42]  and the after party today is going to be all about the honorable mentions and winners of ultra wide
[4630.42 --> 4637.54]  festival so thank you for tuning into the wan show today and that is the outro oh i didn't get to wave
[4639.54 --> 4645.70]  the other one
[4645.70 --> 4649.30]  yeah you had enough waving you good i was just gonna go until you cut the stream
[4651.78 --> 4666.10]  damn it oh wait that's an overlay i thought you put it in the corner i was like i have to keep going
[4666.10 --> 4667.30]  watch bullion
[4672.34 --> 4672.66]  again
[4676.66 --> 4677.38]  let's see
[4677.38 --> 4681.40]  It
