[0.00 --> 1.62]  Sorry, can I just stay on my phone or no?
[1.68 --> 2.90]  You can stay on your phone.
[3.02 --> 3.86]  All right, guys.
[4.32 --> 7.02]  Welcome to the Ultimate WAN Show.
[7.16 --> 9.54]  We have never done anything like this before.
[9.94 --> 11.80]  We have had Austin as a guest.
[12.00 --> 14.06]  I have had Luke as my co-host.
[14.28 --> 16.88]  We have had Lou over there as a guest.
[17.06 --> 18.76]  We have had Marcus as a guest.
[18.94 --> 21.90]  But we have never done it all at the same time.
[22.78 --> 26.52]  Well, I shouldn't say we've never done it all at the same time.
[26.62 --> 28.76]  We've never done it all at the same time on camera.
[28.76 --> 29.54]  There we go.
[29.66 --> 30.32]  There we go.
[30.32 --> 30.68]  Yeah.
[31.88 --> 36.64]  So, guys, we're coming to you live from the actually I want to give a shout out to Corsair.
[36.84 --> 41.48]  They're not a sponsor or anything for this, but we got kicked out of our hotel at 11 o'clock today.
[41.66 --> 45.40]  And I was like, we need somewhere to do the WAN show.
[45.90 --> 49.70]  Can we use your suite, like your massive, awesome suite with the pool table?
[50.00 --> 51.96]  And they're like, yeah, man, no problem.
[52.14 --> 57.94]  So we're coming to you live from the 51st floor of the Palazzo Hotel here in Las Vegas.
[57.94 --> 59.46]  We've had a great week at CES.
[60.16 --> 61.94]  And this is going to be a fun show.
[62.04 --> 63.02]  There is no agenda.
[63.42 --> 64.20]  There's nothing.
[64.42 --> 64.98]  There's just...
[64.98 --> 65.30]  No plan.
[65.46 --> 65.74]  Nothing.
[66.60 --> 69.90]  This is the least prepped WAN show, I think, ever.
[69.98 --> 72.92]  Because usually, even if we don't have a doc, we'll kind of know what happened that week.
[73.54 --> 73.74]  But...
[73.74 --> 74.14]  Nope.
[74.48 --> 74.64]  Nope.
[74.64 --> 75.72]  No title two happened.
[76.26 --> 76.46]  Yep.
[76.52 --> 77.54]  Other than that, CES.
[77.64 --> 78.02]  There you go.
[78.10 --> 78.48]  All right.
[78.64 --> 79.34]  Intro time.
[79.34 --> 80.34]  Yeah.
[82.56 --> 83.36]  It's...
[83.36 --> 84.52]  Yeah, it's not a decision.
[86.64 --> 87.28]  I'm not a decision.
[90.28 --> 90.64]  What?
[91.18 --> 91.84]  I'm getting it.
[92.40 --> 93.36]  Oh, it might be mine.
[93.74 --> 94.08]  God!
[94.68 --> 95.18]  Yeah, damn.
[96.30 --> 97.74]  And they can totally hear us right now.
[97.90 --> 98.08]  Sweet.
[103.42 --> 104.44]  Oh, hold on a second.
[104.66 --> 106.22]  We don't even have any sponsors today.
[106.22 --> 107.92]  We weren't even planning to do WAN show.
[107.94 --> 108.60]  We didn't add it.
[108.68 --> 109.12]  I don't have...
[109.12 --> 109.26]  It's there.
[109.36 --> 109.82]  It's right there.
[109.92 --> 110.32]  No, it's okay.
[110.34 --> 110.72]  Drag it in.
[110.80 --> 111.14]  I don't care.
[111.16 --> 111.46]  No, you got it.
[111.50 --> 111.92]  Drag it in.
[112.04 --> 113.70]  Shout out to our CES Wants Yourself.
[113.70 --> 114.70]  I believed in you.
[114.82 --> 118.70]  Phantom Glass with their awesome screen protectors, as well as HyperX with their gaming content
[118.70 --> 119.26]  on their channel.
[119.28 --> 120.12]  We've got a video coming soon from Phantom Glass.
[120.24 --> 120.90]  It's going to be super cool.
[121.20 --> 122.54]  Are you going to keep teasing that?
[122.54 --> 122.78]  Yeah.
[123.06 --> 123.50]  No, no, no.
[123.58 --> 123.78]  Okay.
[124.16 --> 125.42]  These guys have been teasing it.
[125.84 --> 130.04]  I can actually legitimately tease it, because I might have been in it.
[130.08 --> 130.32]  Yeah.
[130.50 --> 131.64]  And it might have been awesome.
[131.88 --> 132.04]  No.
[132.04 --> 133.12]  It was definitely awesome.
[133.12 --> 134.28]  And I might have been in it.
[134.54 --> 135.18]  Can we...
[135.18 --> 135.82]  How much...
[135.82 --> 136.98]  Should we tease what we did?
[137.04 --> 137.80]  No, no, no.
[137.80 --> 138.18]  No, no.
[138.18 --> 138.52]  No, no.
[138.52 --> 138.70]  We can't tell.
[138.74 --> 138.90]  No?
[139.02 --> 139.68]  That has to be...
[139.68 --> 140.14]  They'll have to see.
[140.28 --> 140.70]  They'll have to see.
[140.72 --> 142.78]  Can we say it involves Austin's nipples?
[143.20 --> 144.02]  Yes, we can say that.
[144.42 --> 144.92]  We can say that.
[145.00 --> 145.60]  Well, we did it.
[145.84 --> 146.88]  So it's a little bit late.
[147.08 --> 148.72]  It's kind of implied, I guess.
[148.86 --> 150.94]  I mean, they can draw their own conclusions.
[151.30 --> 151.50]  Yeah.
[151.86 --> 152.04]  Yeah.
[152.30 --> 152.62]  All right.
[152.72 --> 153.46]  So, guys...
[153.46 --> 154.74]  We both were involved in the...
[154.74 --> 154.94]  Yeah.
[155.30 --> 158.86]  I don't know if we really have a hashtag or anything, so...
[158.86 --> 159.54]  Hashtag WAN show.
[159.72 --> 160.08]  I just...
[160.08 --> 161.28]  Hashtag Austin's nipples.
[162.04 --> 162.46]  Oh, no.
[162.50 --> 163.32]  I like that way better.
[163.96 --> 165.26]  Hashtag Austin's nipple.
[165.66 --> 166.18]  Hashtag...
[166.18 --> 167.94]  Hashtag Austin's nipples.
[168.28 --> 168.44]  Yeah.
[168.50 --> 169.34]  That is the WAN show.
[169.44 --> 172.62]  That is the hashtag that we will be monitoring during the stream.
[172.72 --> 173.14]  Okay, guys?
[173.42 --> 173.82]  Success.
[174.00 --> 174.74]  Holy crap.
[174.74 --> 175.10]  What?
[175.42 --> 178.06]  There is already pictures of Austin's nipple.
[179.18 --> 180.78]  That hashtag already exists.
[181.16 --> 181.72]  Oh, wait.
[181.84 --> 182.36]  Can you see that?
[183.26 --> 183.72]  Oh, never mind.
[183.78 --> 185.70]  There actually is a picture of my nipple on the internet.
[186.34 --> 187.06]  Is that it?
[187.14 --> 189.74]  It's when I broke my arm, and there's like a picture of me with like...
[189.74 --> 190.22]  Yeah, like a...
[190.22 --> 192.42]  And a slang with no shirt on, so...
[192.42 --> 193.02]  Blockage?
[193.50 --> 193.80]  Yeah.
[194.14 --> 195.20]  That's actually kind of fantastic.
[195.70 --> 196.88]  I love how...
[196.88 --> 200.04]  I don't think like almost anyone's commenting about the fact that people are just straight
[200.04 --> 200.92]  up playing pool in the background.
[200.94 --> 201.20]  Oh, yeah.
[201.30 --> 201.80]  Yeah, there's...
[201.80 --> 202.24]  There are people.
[202.86 --> 203.22]  Cool.
[203.42 --> 204.02]  All right.
[204.28 --> 206.20]  So, guys, why don't we...
[206.20 --> 207.32]  Why don't we kick this off?
[207.42 --> 208.16]  Show highlights.
[208.76 --> 213.24]  I mean, it's a good thing people are watching the show to find out what you enjoyed here,
[213.24 --> 215.84]  because they are not going to find that out by watching your channel.
[215.84 --> 216.20]  Oh.
[216.52 --> 216.92]  Ooh.
[217.40 --> 218.20]  Okay, okay, okay.
[218.56 --> 220.84]  So, this is the first CES.
[220.92 --> 221.82]  This is my fifth CES.
[221.94 --> 225.22]  This is the first time I've come without having to do a ton of videos.
[225.52 --> 225.86]  Right, yeah.
[225.86 --> 230.20]  Like, the first couple years, it's just like, I did 30 videos by myself, and I was just like...
[230.20 --> 231.92]  Zombie mode.
[232.02 --> 232.36]  Exactly.
[232.58 --> 234.48]  So, this year, I decided to take it easy.
[234.86 --> 236.04]  So, I do have videos.
[236.82 --> 238.00]  One's live right now.
[238.66 --> 239.84]  We shot...
[239.84 --> 242.12]  We finished two of my other videos today.
[242.12 --> 242.52]  Okay.
[242.52 --> 247.70]  So, I have three CES videos, and if you guys want to watch more CES videos, there might
[247.70 --> 250.60]  be some other tech channel that may have posted a couple.
[251.96 --> 253.24]  I forget the name.
[254.12 --> 256.20]  I'm just going to keep staring awkwardly in the camera.
[257.22 --> 257.84]  I don't know.
[257.96 --> 259.26]  You mean like you always do?
[259.36 --> 259.86]  All the way.
[260.28 --> 260.68]  Oh.
[260.96 --> 261.44]  Oh.
[261.82 --> 262.32]  I'm sorry.
[262.42 --> 262.70]  I'm sorry.
[262.82 --> 263.34]  All right, I'm out.
[263.42 --> 263.60]  See you.
[263.92 --> 265.08]  Oh, that was rough.
[265.28 --> 266.40]  Someone's got to tag you out.
[266.58 --> 267.92]  That's how this system works, I think.
[268.60 --> 269.98]  Yeah, but anyway, show highlights.
[270.94 --> 271.38]  Ooh.
[272.12 --> 275.54]  Okay, so I don't want to spoil my video too much.
[275.64 --> 275.80]  Okay.
[275.88 --> 276.80]  Let me go over the stuff I did.
[277.02 --> 277.28]  Oh, right.
[277.40 --> 277.98]  Because you...
[277.98 --> 279.70]  You'll see the videos.
[279.80 --> 281.58]  Yeah, I didn't want to go crazy on videos this year.
[281.60 --> 281.62]  Oh.
[281.84 --> 281.98]  Yeah.
[283.54 --> 285.36]  We have the weirdest audience ever.
[286.26 --> 287.92]  There's a lot of cool stuff at the BMW booth.
[288.32 --> 289.42]  So, we actually checked that out.
[289.52 --> 291.24]  They had the ISV and the I8.
[291.34 --> 293.18]  They had inductive charging for the I8.
[293.28 --> 296.16]  So, literally, you just pull in, mark, and it's charging.
[296.36 --> 296.48]  That was cool.
[296.48 --> 296.98]  Super cool.
[297.16 --> 297.32]  Yeah.
[297.32 --> 302.14]  There's a really cool laser headlight demo where, literally, it's like, it can shine like
[302.14 --> 303.18]  a spotlight on anything.
[303.38 --> 306.12]  So, like, you could be driving down with, like, complete high beams and, like, there's
[306.12 --> 306.52]  a car.
[306.84 --> 310.36]  Literally, the light would turn down for just, like, that tiny bit of car tracking.
[310.36 --> 311.06]  That's really cool.
[311.08 --> 312.44]  Or, like, you're driving by and there's, like, a deer.
[312.54 --> 315.48]  Literally, like, it would, like, shine a spotlight on the deer using the laser headlights.
[315.86 --> 316.58]  Crazy stuff.
[316.66 --> 316.76]  Wow.
[316.76 --> 317.24]  That's sick.
[317.24 --> 319.48]  The I3, it literally drives itself.
[319.84 --> 323.80]  So, like, you, like, tap the button on the smartwatch and the car pulls up.
[324.02 --> 326.04]  And, like, you see, like, the wheels spinning and everything.
[326.10 --> 326.80]  You just get in it.
[327.14 --> 328.78]  It, like, you cannot crash it.
[328.80 --> 332.98]  Like, even when you're driving it, like, you could, like, completely floor the car and
[332.98 --> 334.02]  drive toward, like, a barrier.
[334.36 --> 335.54]  Straight up, just, like, wouldn't hit it.
[335.78 --> 336.96]  Like, literally, it just, like, stops.
[337.14 --> 337.64]  It's like, no.
[338.08 --> 338.40]  Wow.
[338.74 --> 340.62]  So, were they letting people demo that?
[341.30 --> 342.00]  Oh, I ate.
[342.06 --> 342.36]  Tag in.
[342.46 --> 342.72]  Tag in.
[342.72 --> 343.44]  Can I tag in right now?
[343.94 --> 344.34]  All right.
[344.48 --> 344.80]  There you go.
[346.02 --> 346.42]  I don't know.
[346.56 --> 346.96]  How does this work?
[346.96 --> 347.82]  Probably have you even had to catch this.
[348.06 --> 348.70]  Yeah, you're good.
[348.86 --> 349.12]  You're good.
[349.26 --> 349.92]  Microphones are here?
[350.14 --> 350.32]  Yep.
[350.46 --> 350.58]  Yep.
[350.96 --> 351.72]  Camera's over there.
[351.88 --> 352.30]  Mike's here.
[353.70 --> 354.02]  Hey.
[354.62 --> 359.44]  I tagged in about I8, but, or BMW in general.
[359.56 --> 361.92]  I spent a lot of time with their booth, like, a whole day, two days ago.
[362.92 --> 364.66]  He's talked about the laser headlights.
[365.20 --> 365.86]  That was awesome.
[366.50 --> 369.70]  And that's not really legal in the United States, unfortunately.
[370.00 --> 371.06]  Laser headlights in general.
[371.30 --> 374.42]  So Audi's doing it, BMW's doing it, but it's not going to come here.
[374.56 --> 375.86]  So, in Europe, they're doing that.
[376.04 --> 376.36]  Interesting.
[377.06 --> 380.08]  And then the OLED taillights is another thing.
[380.10 --> 380.90]  I don't know if you mentioned that.
[381.10 --> 381.30]  Nope.
[381.42 --> 383.88]  It's basically a display on the back of your car.
[384.18 --> 387.68]  Two OLED panels and lots of diodes, and they're really bright.
[387.94 --> 390.72]  And they looked awesome, because they had the whole laser light show, and those are cool.
[390.82 --> 391.56]  Any color you want.
[393.06 --> 393.64]  What else?
[394.28 --> 395.28]  Have you been able to drive it?
[395.66 --> 396.82]  I didn't drive it.
[396.82 --> 397.84]  I've driven the I8.
[398.02 --> 400.44]  I have not driven the M4 or the I3.
[400.44 --> 402.90]  I sat in the I3 that they tried to crash.
[403.24 --> 406.16]  Where the dude literally floored it, and it stopped itself.
[406.26 --> 411.18]  But then, while it was stopped, he, just to make sure I knew, floored it a couple more times, and the car wouldn't go.
[411.30 --> 413.20]  So, that was a lot of trust in that car.
[413.20 --> 417.30]  Did you have your seatbelt on, or did they tell you to do it?
[417.36 --> 417.90]  No seatbelt.
[417.96 --> 418.28]  It's okay.
[418.34 --> 420.80]  Well, I had my camera in my hand, so I kind of wanted to be safe about it anyway.
[420.94 --> 421.08]  Right.
[421.08 --> 422.80]  But it was really cool.
[422.88 --> 424.72]  And then I sat in the backseat of one that drove itself.
[425.42 --> 431.00]  So, it was summoned by a smart car, a smart watch app, and he pressed to bring the car to him.
[431.08 --> 436.80]  And then, 30 yards away, an I3 with no one in it starts rolling around the corner, and pulls up right next to him, and unlocks the door.
[437.22 --> 438.28]  Which is pretty cool.
[438.48 --> 439.38]  That's actually pretty sick.
[439.50 --> 439.68]  Yeah.
[440.12 --> 443.62]  So, I sat in the back of it, and the steering wheel started whooping around.
[443.90 --> 447.92]  Actually, right when I sat in it, when the lady closed the door behind me, I set up the camera and everything.
[448.04 --> 449.20]  It was kind of quiet for a little bit.
[449.20 --> 454.06]  And I knew the guy had summoned it because the steering wheel snapped into place, and then slowly started rolling.
[454.26 --> 454.94]  It was kind of cool.
[455.46 --> 455.98]  That's sick.
[456.26 --> 456.50]  Yeah.
[456.70 --> 462.82]  I know last year, I did a video on the I3, and this is the first time I'd driven an electric car.
[463.14 --> 463.32]  Okay.
[463.46 --> 467.42]  So, I was going around Las Vegas, and they had the route that you were allowed to go on.
[467.82 --> 471.28]  But my plan was, I'm hoping I'm past statute of limitations here.
[471.70 --> 476.22]  My plan was we were going to swap out drivers, because I wanted Brandon, my cameraman, to be able to try it out as well.
[476.22 --> 481.88]  But, as we're coming around the corners, I was just talking about how I like the acceleration and the torque in electric cars.
[482.18 --> 484.44]  Coming around a corner, and there's this giant, empty street.
[485.14 --> 486.26]  So, I was like, all right, sweet.
[486.38 --> 487.76]  And I just stepped on it.
[488.14 --> 489.12]  It was beautiful.
[489.26 --> 489.74]  It was amazing.
[490.06 --> 494.34]  And that was the first time that I got to experience the braking in electric cars.
[494.56 --> 494.76]  Okay.
[494.76 --> 500.86]  Which was interesting as well, because I maybe almost hit someone and had to change lanes like a couple times to spare between them.
[500.96 --> 502.18]  Because I was going too fast.
[502.54 --> 505.16]  But, anyways, statute of limitations, whatever.
[505.42 --> 505.62]  Yeah.
[505.78 --> 506.28]  It was cool.
[507.52 --> 508.94]  What other car stuff have you checked out here?
[509.60 --> 511.60]  I have done I8 stuff.
[511.60 --> 513.60]  I didn't do a lot of I8 while I was here.
[514.04 --> 518.98]  But, today, I basically just shot a bunch of footage of the Tesla Model X that's in the Panasonic's booth.
[519.12 --> 519.24]  Yeah.
[519.88 --> 520.86]  And it was crowded.
[521.04 --> 523.08]  Like, I got to it on day one, and, of course, it was crowded.
[523.18 --> 524.12]  I was like, all right, I'll come back later.
[524.44 --> 525.28]  Came back to it yesterday.
[525.40 --> 526.02]  It was still crowded.
[526.12 --> 527.94]  I was like, all right, I'll come back tomorrow.
[528.12 --> 528.90]  Today, it should be dead.
[529.28 --> 531.46]  Today, at 2 p.m., it's still very crowded.
[531.94 --> 533.02]  So, the footage is all right.
[533.26 --> 536.10]  But there's a lot of cool stuff about that that I want to talk about.
[536.60 --> 540.04]  Well, they were doing a pretty good job of keeping it all right for you.
[540.04 --> 544.84]  I heard that some, like, white dude showed up and was getting all up in your space.
[545.08 --> 545.18]  Yeah.
[545.40 --> 546.32]  And, yeah.
[546.58 --> 547.34]  He had, like, a tripod.
[547.34 --> 547.36]  I had, like, a hand.
[547.36 --> 548.14]  I had, like, a hand.
[548.22 --> 550.24]  Like, sir, he's filming right now.
[550.38 --> 550.82]  Go away.
[550.84 --> 555.64]  It was weird, because last year, the video I did at the Panasonic booth was a Tesla Model S.
[555.78 --> 556.90]  But all the doors were closed.
[557.12 --> 557.70]  The trunk was closed.
[557.76 --> 558.52]  You couldn't, like, look in.
[558.56 --> 560.98]  So, people would, like, walk up to the car, look at it for a second, and leave.
[561.28 --> 564.98]  So, I did a whole video about it then, and that's the first time I was in contact with Tesla after that video.
[565.56 --> 569.50]  So, I come to the booth today, and I guess the guy was like, yeah, oh, yeah, you want to do a video again this year.
[569.50 --> 570.60]  Okay, I'll help you out.
[570.70 --> 574.84]  And basically just started, like, fending off people who got near me as I was getting footage.
[575.14 --> 578.94]  And I guess Austin was trying to get B-roll, and he was like, sir, you're going to have to wait for this guy to finish.
[579.52 --> 581.88]  And I just kind of, like, I was like, is that Austin that you just pushed out?
[582.88 --> 583.76]  It was kind of funny.
[583.96 --> 585.12]  But, yeah, that happened.
[585.26 --> 586.08]  What do you think of Model S?
[587.06 --> 588.32]  It's a weird thing.
[588.42 --> 590.26]  So, I saw, I did a Tesla.
[590.64 --> 591.78]  That's a good intro for that.
[591.82 --> 593.68]  They're going to put that on the marketing materials for it?
[593.68 --> 594.26]  It's a weird thing.
[594.26 --> 595.04]  It's a weird thing.
[595.62 --> 596.02]  MKBHD.
[596.34 --> 597.14]  Put it on the bumper, yeah.
[597.14 --> 597.70]  Yeah, yeah.
[597.70 --> 603.10]  No, I saw one at the, I did a Tesla factory tour, and I saw an earlier prototype.
[603.64 --> 606.70]  And the side view mirrors were just cameras pointed backwards.
[606.86 --> 607.16]  Everybody.
[607.46 --> 610.02]  And that was another one of those legal things, like, can you really do that?
[610.08 --> 611.58]  And apparently in certain states you can't.
[611.64 --> 614.64]  And then eventually it's just like, man, I might as well just go rear view mirrors.
[614.84 --> 617.96]  So, they're traditional rear view mirrors on the one I saw in the Panasonic booth.
[618.60 --> 621.36]  Other minor changes, like the doors are different things.
[621.36 --> 623.02]  The seats look different every time I see it.
[623.02 --> 626.88]  But it's still a weird vehicle that a lot of people are curious about.
[627.02 --> 628.50]  Like, there are tons of questions every time.
[628.84 --> 628.88]  Yeah.
[628.88 --> 629.38]  What about that one?
[629.38 --> 638.74]  The one thing that I'm, it's a dual motor chassis, essentially dual motor system, the same way the P85D is.
[638.86 --> 638.98]  Yeah.
[638.98 --> 644.44]  The one thing is the doors, when they lift up, I was reading this in a Reddit thread.
[644.84 --> 649.14]  It creates these little cracks, like if it's raining, you're just letting rain pour into your car.
[649.84 --> 654.16]  So, I was trying to get as many angles of the door opening as possible, but I only really got one.
[654.50 --> 660.38]  But it seemed like that could be a problem, if there's just water falling into your car every time you open the door.
[661.14 --> 661.94]  Hopefully that's not a problem.
[661.94 --> 665.60]  They might be able to solve that by putting like a fabric liner, a stretchy fabric liner or something.
[665.80 --> 666.66]  But it's not solved yet.
[666.88 --> 668.48]  Yeah, and there's little things.
[668.78 --> 670.86]  Like, this is on my wife's sold.
[670.96 --> 672.18]  It's like a 2008 Rabbit.
[673.60 --> 679.42]  But just, even though it looks like the water should just drip down, they just, the way they've curved the metal.
[679.44 --> 680.14]  Oh, it just rolls in.
[680.18 --> 681.48]  Causes it to just roll down.
[681.80 --> 681.98]  Yeah.
[682.14 --> 684.56]  And knowing Tesla, they've probably thought of that.
[684.76 --> 685.26]  I think so.
[685.56 --> 686.42]  I have faith in that.
[686.58 --> 687.32]  But yeah, I'm excited.
[687.32 --> 690.16]  I think it's supposed to start manufacturing this year.
[690.46 --> 691.42]  So, we'll see it around.
[691.94 --> 696.82]  One of the reasons you couldn't touch the vehicle was the doors, they didn't have the safety off installed yet.
[696.90 --> 697.08]  Yeah.
[697.10 --> 698.20]  They would just close on your body.
[698.34 --> 699.34]  The hydraulics, yeah.
[699.48 --> 700.36]  That would be bad.
[700.90 --> 702.22]  They had to demo it very carefully.
[704.74 --> 705.42]  That's awesome.
[706.70 --> 710.16]  I actually, I had a plan to check out a whole bunch of car stuff this year.
[710.58 --> 716.22]  And it's cool talking to you about it because I basically got to check out none, which was not great.
[717.02 --> 718.44]  But yeah, I don't know.
[718.80 --> 720.68]  Did you get to check out like Audi and stuff as well?
[720.68 --> 721.70]  Audi, no.
[721.80 --> 725.68]  I heard about their booth and I heard about stuff they did with the smartwatch, but I didn't get to visit them.
[725.68 --> 733.90]  So, I guess I was kind of focused on like a few dense spots of the show floor rather than try to, you know, explore as much as I did last year.
[734.68 --> 736.60]  But yeah, I heard about Audi stuff, but I didn't get to see it.
[736.86 --> 737.48]  I mean, I'm...
[737.48 --> 738.12]  Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[738.12 --> 742.64]  This is kind of a completely offshoot thing, but was this the first show that you've shot on a RED?
[743.00 --> 743.34]  Yes.
[744.02 --> 747.32]  I've done more shooting out with this camera than I did before.
[747.38 --> 748.10]  Every year it's fun.
[748.20 --> 750.72]  I mean, every time you get a new camera, it's fun to just go out and shoot and see who you can.
[750.72 --> 756.20]  So, this is one of those times where I'm just discovering really what this camera is capable of and how much I enjoy using it.
[756.24 --> 757.96]  So, it was a lot of fun to shoot with it this year.
[758.48 --> 760.74]  Last year it was the C100.
[761.24 --> 762.36]  Which reason is a mic stand.
[762.36 --> 767.02]  Yeah, but I mean, I don't shoot outside as much as I would like to.
[767.38 --> 768.94]  So, it's fun to get out and do stuff like this.
[769.18 --> 769.70]  Yeah, for sure.
[770.82 --> 776.24]  So, you've talked about cars an awful lot, but was there anything mobile-wise that stood out to you at the show this year?
[776.78 --> 777.76]  Not really mobile.
[778.04 --> 784.86]  I mean, I saw the new G Flex 2, which was probably the most outstanding phone at the show, I think, that people are talking about.
[785.36 --> 791.10]  It seems like a phone people would actually want to buy, whereas the first one, cool concept, cool idea, but I don't think anyone's going to actually buy that.
[791.10 --> 796.66]  Right, so it's a little closer to the G3 in its size and shape and aesthetics.
[798.30 --> 798.90]  I'm good.
[799.32 --> 806.00]  And then there's the, actually it's not mobile, but I was actually impressed with 8K TVs.
[806.70 --> 810.20]  I saw one in the Sharp booth and I think in the Sony booth as well.
[811.14 --> 818.22]  And there were like 89 inches and 98 inches or something related to this, but I can actually tell the difference in the way it looked versus 4K TV.
[818.48 --> 819.46]  Not going to have any content.
[819.46 --> 820.10]  Yeah.
[820.10 --> 821.66]  It's not going to look that good all the time.
[822.12 --> 824.00]  But it looked really cool with the demos.
[824.12 --> 826.50]  They had these, you could basically walk up and read fine text.
[826.80 --> 829.06]  Did you see the Sony projector?
[829.60 --> 831.10]  The $55,000 projector.
[831.88 --> 832.44]  Was it the pair?
[832.44 --> 832.54]  The pair?
[833.68 --> 834.06]  Sorry?
[834.12 --> 834.84]  The pair of projectors?
[834.92 --> 835.92]  Yeah, the pair of projectors.
[835.94 --> 836.08]  Yeah, yeah, I saw that.
[836.16 --> 837.08]  That was pretty cool.
[837.82 --> 839.28]  7 inches from the wall.
[839.46 --> 839.68]  Yeah.
[839.68 --> 842.80]  And a 147 inch image.
[843.34 --> 844.72]  Laser, laser projector.
[844.84 --> 846.30]  They hand build them to order.
[846.42 --> 847.40]  You wait 6 to 8 weeks.
[847.46 --> 847.92]  It doesn't matter.
[848.00 --> 849.54]  You're the king of Egypt.
[849.86 --> 851.64]  You wait 6 to 8 weeks for your projector.
[852.04 --> 852.24]  Yeah.
[852.24 --> 855.86]  And as awesome as I would be, I don't have a wall that built in my apartment.
[856.32 --> 858.82]  So, it was cool to see at the demo, but yeah.
[859.18 --> 860.24]  I look like some Egyptian...
[861.06 --> 861.84]  This new light is...
[861.84 --> 862.62]  Yeah, yeah.
[862.68 --> 863.38]  It's pretty intense.
[863.38 --> 863.74]  Pretty intense, yeah.
[863.74 --> 864.60]  I don't know what's going on there.
[864.66 --> 866.28]  I think Egypt is a democracy, by the way.
[866.66 --> 866.90]  Oh.
[867.34 --> 867.70]  Interesting.
[867.94 --> 868.80]  Mad sun.
[868.80 --> 870.18]  I'm literally glowing.
[870.36 --> 871.08]  This is fantastic.
[873.62 --> 875.50]  You know how pregnant women get that glow?
[876.10 --> 876.74]  So, you're pregnant.
[876.74 --> 877.62]  They're all going to envy me now.
[877.86 --> 879.24]  I'm like four times pregnant.
[879.84 --> 880.66]  Don't even worry about it.
[880.92 --> 881.20]  All right.
[881.26 --> 882.10]  So, go ahead.
[882.56 --> 883.82]  What is your favorite stuff of the show?
[884.46 --> 887.50]  I mean, for me, I think this is a pretty obvious one.
[887.88 --> 890.60]  I get really excited about thin and light laptops.
[890.60 --> 893.32]  I get really excited about high performance gaming.
[893.92 --> 898.32]  And I get super bummed out when there's no such thing as a thin and light laptop.
[898.80 --> 900.24]  That performs really well.
[900.58 --> 902.06]  That has great battery life.
[902.80 --> 903.04]  That...
[903.04 --> 905.62]  I mean, I'm just asking to have my cake and eat it too at this point.
[905.72 --> 906.86]  So, I don't know.
[906.90 --> 909.44]  You probably didn't check out any computer stuff at the show, right?
[909.64 --> 911.96]  Much less than last year, which wasn't out in the first place.
[912.10 --> 912.16]  Yeah.
[912.32 --> 917.66]  So, MSI, of all people, has a laptop that's hyper thin.
[917.66 --> 919.34]  It's actually lighter than...
[919.34 --> 921.22]  I believe it's lighter than the MacBook Air.
[921.68 --> 921.84]  Wow.
[921.90 --> 922.86]  But don't quote me on that.
[923.02 --> 925.14]  Super light, 13.3 inch notebook.
[925.36 --> 925.38]  Whoa!
[925.58 --> 926.10]  Wait, wait.
[926.10 --> 929.30]  And basically, it's got this proprietary slot in the back.
[929.76 --> 932.24]  And you slide it into this dock that's pretty boxy.
[932.32 --> 933.10]  It's pretty big.
[933.46 --> 936.30]  And then inside that dock is a full desktop graphics card.
[936.48 --> 936.70]  Okay.
[936.88 --> 938.42]  So, you power it down.
[938.96 --> 940.02]  You take it off.
[940.08 --> 941.42]  In order to take it off, you put it on.
[941.42 --> 945.28]  And then when you boot up, the computer doesn't even know that there's onboard graphics.
[945.44 --> 948.42]  You're just running directly off of an external graphics card.
[948.42 --> 954.18]  So, you'll get exactly the same gaming experience, pretty much, on this laptop with an external monitor.
[954.48 --> 954.66]  Yeah.
[954.84 --> 958.66]  And then you want to go somewhere and have it not be, like, heavy.
[959.18 --> 959.68]  Super light.
[959.88 --> 963.78]  Would there ever be a way to get it to be able to undock and re-op without powering down?
[963.92 --> 965.10]  That's probably a lot more difficult.
[965.52 --> 966.80]  That is a lot more difficult.
[966.80 --> 972.18]  With Thunderbolt 3 or something, it could be possible.
[972.68 --> 977.74]  But, I mean, the rumor now, though, is that the new MacBook Air is just going to be USB 3 Type-C.
[977.84 --> 978.42]  I saw that.
[978.64 --> 984.22]  And I tweeted about that because I feel like the next version of it will inevitably have two or three more Thunderbolt ports.
[984.70 --> 986.56]  And, oh, we listened to your complaints and we saw that.
[986.64 --> 987.90]  And now you have more ports.
[988.54 --> 990.12]  But the only port was that one.
[990.32 --> 993.76]  And I feel like so when you're charged or charging, you don't have any ports.
[994.40 --> 996.02]  That's kind of a problem.
[996.02 --> 1003.96]  I heard a conspiracy theory that what they're going to do is they're going to have the power brick have your I.O. on it.
[1004.06 --> 1005.12]  Yeah, I would believe that.
[1005.96 --> 1006.24]  Okay.
[1006.60 --> 1006.70]  Interesting.
[1007.22 --> 1007.84]  That makes sense.
[1007.86 --> 1010.16]  But still, what if you want to use the I.O. without the power brick, though?
[1010.44 --> 1012.04]  Well, you already have your power brick with you.
[1012.56 --> 1013.54]  No, not if you have a MacBook Air.
[1013.54 --> 1021.66]  I mean, if you're just going to class and you want to bring this laptop to class and, oh, I also need to plug in a projector to do a presentation,
[1022.14 --> 1024.50]  does that mean you need to be plugged into the wall also?
[1024.50 --> 1025.32]  That is kind of annoying.
[1025.32 --> 1026.32]  I feel like...
[1026.32 --> 1027.94]  I'm not sure on that one.
[1028.56 --> 1031.64]  The guy seemed pretty convinced, though, that it was a totally possible thing.
[1032.58 --> 1033.26]  Like, just...
[1033.26 --> 1038.12]  I could see a $60 breakout cable in the Apple store, but I just don't know how they would make that happen.
[1038.88 --> 1039.08]  I don't know.
[1039.70 --> 1040.18]  Yeah, $60.
[1040.28 --> 1041.52]  That's pretty reasonable.
[1041.86 --> 1042.58]  For an Apple cable.
[1042.80 --> 1043.68]  Yeah, for an Apple accessory.
[1045.26 --> 1046.30]  USB Type-C is pretty nice.
[1046.36 --> 1047.98]  Have you been able to see the show at all?
[1048.20 --> 1048.40]  Nope.
[1048.66 --> 1049.76]  I haven't seen it yet either.
[1050.28 --> 1050.56]  Really?
[1050.56 --> 1051.32]  You saw it, right?
[1051.32 --> 1051.90]  Yeah, yeah.
[1052.26 --> 1052.66]  It's okay.
[1052.82 --> 1055.16]  So it looks really similar to micro-USB cable.
[1055.66 --> 1056.08]  That small?
[1056.28 --> 1057.00]  Which is scary.
[1057.14 --> 1057.70]  It's quite small.
[1057.86 --> 1059.32]  Yeah, it's a little bit longer, it seems.
[1059.90 --> 1062.76]  And the locking connector on it is pretty intense.
[1062.96 --> 1064.36]  You don't see teeth or anything.
[1064.48 --> 1065.56]  It's internally locking.
[1065.82 --> 1066.02]  Right.
[1066.02 --> 1069.78]  So, actually, the first couple times that I plugged it in, I didn't realize that it was...
[1069.78 --> 1070.28]  That it was locked?
[1070.40 --> 1071.02]  That it was...
[1071.02 --> 1072.58]  I didn't push it in all the way.
[1072.78 --> 1073.06]  Oh.
[1073.14 --> 1075.02]  Because I hit the end and was like, okay, cool.
[1075.50 --> 1076.46]  And then I was like, that's...
[1076.46 --> 1076.74]  All right.
[1076.78 --> 1078.36]  And it sat in the port fairly well.
[1078.66 --> 1082.84]  But then, actually, Nick Van Burkle went to go plug it in and plugged it in a lot more aggressively.
[1083.12 --> 1083.76]  And it clicked.
[1083.90 --> 1084.92]  Like, audibly clicked.
[1085.20 --> 1087.94]  And then to take it out, you kind of have to, like, jostle a little bit and take it out.
[1088.16 --> 1089.76]  It's quite a locking cable.
[1089.86 --> 1090.68]  And is that done?
[1091.40 --> 1092.34]  Or is that prototype?
[1092.78 --> 1093.14]  Done.
[1093.14 --> 1097.68]  Yeah, it's like the port and the cable are both fully released.
[1098.16 --> 1099.74]  The motherboard is not completely ready yet.
[1100.10 --> 1103.78]  One problem that they're going to have with them is actually something that Austin was talking to me about earlier,
[1103.96 --> 1108.86]  which is where the standards for the cables and the ports and the devices are going to be all over the place.
[1109.00 --> 1109.90]  It's going to be a mess.
[1110.04 --> 1111.10]  It's going to be a complete mess.
[1111.22 --> 1111.56]  Is it reversible or no?
[1111.78 --> 1112.76]  There's, yeah, there's several.
[1112.86 --> 1114.50]  There's the USB that just charges.
[1114.82 --> 1116.38]  You have to tag someone out if you want to talk.
[1116.92 --> 1118.14]  You can tag me out if you want.
[1118.52 --> 1118.92]  There you go.
[1119.22 --> 1120.96]  I didn't know you could tag out a co-host.
[1121.08 --> 1122.84]  There are no rules on the WAN show.
[1122.84 --> 1125.04]  No, you can tag me out.
[1125.14 --> 1126.64]  This can be Marcus Austin.
[1126.84 --> 1127.78]  Yeah, I'll take over.
[1128.00 --> 1129.74]  You don't want to let me loose on that, man.
[1131.30 --> 1138.04]  No, so basically the guy I was talking to, he said there are going to be several different kinds of these Type-C connectors.
[1138.04 --> 1140.10]  So there's some that will just charge.
[1140.58 --> 1142.46]  There's some that will be just USB 2.0.
[1142.76 --> 1144.80]  And there will be the, I think he said the full-featured.
[1145.66 --> 1146.24]  Yeah, yeah.
[1146.32 --> 1151.82]  So basically the full-featured ones are the ones that can handle DisplayPort, handle 100 watts of power, handle USB 3.0.
[1151.82 --> 1153.32]  Like, that's the one that you want.
[1153.34 --> 1154.16]  And you're supposed to know that when you're buying it.
[1154.16 --> 1155.42]  And that's the thing, that's what I was asking about.
[1155.46 --> 1156.96]  I was like, well, how are you supposed to know that?
[1157.20 --> 1161.22]  And he's like, well, we're considering maybe putting like the little flags on the cables to show.
[1161.32 --> 1166.02]  But he's like, but manufacturers are not going to want to like do custom like branding or something on it.
[1166.30 --> 1168.02]  So I'm like, man, this seems like a major problem.
[1168.02 --> 1170.48]  That is such a PC thing to do.
[1170.76 --> 1176.20]  Like that is the kind of thing that, like everyone knows, I love the PC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1176.30 --> 1178.14]  But Apple doesn't do that stuff.
[1178.52 --> 1180.16]  If there's a cable, there's a cable.
[1180.24 --> 1181.66]  But you know what they're probably doing?
[1182.14 --> 1187.68]  Is they're probably saving on the copper wiring and the shielding in the less expensive cables.
[1187.94 --> 1192.54]  So they're trying to be like, oh, well, we have a low-cost USB tool version.
[1192.68 --> 1194.38]  But that's going to be a disaster.
[1194.80 --> 1197.40]  I mean, what made USB good is the U.
[1197.44 --> 1197.80]  The U.
[1198.02 --> 1198.62]  Yeah.
[1199.62 --> 1201.32]  You made USB good.
[1201.70 --> 1202.66]  All of you.
[1202.82 --> 1203.38]  And you.
[1203.96 --> 1205.80]  And you.
[1205.94 --> 1206.34]  Thank you.
[1206.44 --> 1207.66]  We all made it possible.
[1207.84 --> 1208.74]  It's all because of us.
[1208.76 --> 1210.56]  I appreciate your recognition of my accomplishments.
[1212.10 --> 1212.44]  I'm honored.
[1213.10 --> 1213.54]  Yeah.
[1213.66 --> 1215.38]  So it's going to be interesting to see.
[1215.64 --> 1221.92]  But that said, being able to do 100 watts of power, DisplayPort, USB, all this kind of stuff over one little tiny cable,
[1221.92 --> 1224.02]  which I was not really quite sure.
[1224.10 --> 1226.86]  I had seen like the pictures and videos of it and it just looked like, okay, whatever.
[1226.86 --> 1230.00]  But it's almost the same size as micro USB.
[1230.44 --> 1231.78]  It's very slightly wider.
[1231.98 --> 1233.18]  I think it might be slightly thinner.
[1233.18 --> 1236.42]  But it's, for all intents and purposes, basically like micro USB, which is awesome.
[1236.52 --> 1237.08]  And it's reversible.
[1237.38 --> 1238.20]  I don't know if you guys talked about that.
[1238.40 --> 1238.86]  But it's like...
[1238.86 --> 1239.46]  Yeah, that's what I was going to ask.
[1239.52 --> 1239.92]  Is it a reverse?
[1240.08 --> 1241.20]  Yeah, you can completely reverse it.
[1241.20 --> 1246.60]  But the one I played with, it was just in like a little kind of custom thing.
[1246.72 --> 1247.10]  It wasn't like...
[1247.10 --> 1248.12]  It wasn't a final cable.
[1248.28 --> 1248.42]  It's a demo thing.
[1248.42 --> 1250.88]  Yeah, but when I was plugging it in, it seemed like it...
[1250.88 --> 1251.50]  It seemed solid.
[1251.66 --> 1253.06]  It wasn't like it's going to fall out.
[1253.12 --> 1255.38]  It kind of felt a little bit like if you guys were trying to like a lightning cable.
[1255.38 --> 1260.34]  He was describing locking it or plugging it all the way in is sort of a thing you have to be conscious of.
[1260.34 --> 1261.10]  Oh, I didn't see that at all.
[1261.10 --> 1262.64]  Well, essentially it's internally locking.
[1263.14 --> 1264.10]  Maybe the one I was.
[1264.32 --> 1265.78]  And then just uploading it all the way in.
[1266.16 --> 1269.46]  Which reminds me of micro USB also with some phones.
[1269.54 --> 1270.74]  Wait, I don't have a cable for that.
[1270.88 --> 1271.10]  Yeah.
[1271.30 --> 1271.94]  On some phones.
[1272.00 --> 1272.54]  Figure something so.
[1273.46 --> 1276.92]  I just realized we never did our video where we announced that the show's live.
[1277.14 --> 1278.92]  So we've only got like 3,000 people watching.
[1279.04 --> 1281.02]  So you guys are the real MVPs.
[1281.02 --> 1283.26]  That's a solid amount of people who watch for no video.
[1283.64 --> 1284.60]  What is this, from tweets?
[1286.02 --> 1289.02]  Well, I think we have like 80,000 followers on Twitch.
[1289.32 --> 1289.68]  Oh, okay.
[1289.68 --> 1291.34]  So like it goes out to those guys.
[1291.44 --> 1296.30]  Those guys, in theory, I think Twitch's subscriber box is even worse than YouTube.
[1296.64 --> 1296.70]  Whoa.
[1297.00 --> 1299.14]  It can take like 24 hours as an email out too.
[1299.38 --> 1299.50]  Yeah.
[1299.56 --> 1302.92]  So unless we do a 24-hour stream, a lot of people will.
[1302.92 --> 1305.78]  I mean, I don't have any flights for a few hours.
[1305.90 --> 1306.82]  We can just miss ours, right?
[1306.90 --> 1307.92]  Like that's cool, right?
[1308.12 --> 1308.32]  Yeah.
[1308.32 --> 1310.76]  We'll just, we're going to stay here in the Corsair suite.
[1310.84 --> 1311.68]  We're going to lock the door.
[1311.96 --> 1313.08]  They're never going to get in.
[1313.64 --> 1314.00]  Barricade.
[1314.20 --> 1315.16]  Sounds like a plan.
[1315.26 --> 1316.34]  Cover the flight change speed.
[1316.52 --> 1317.48]  We say, yeah, no problem.
[1318.32 --> 1319.04]  Upgrades all around.
[1319.82 --> 1320.10]  All right.
[1320.14 --> 1322.66]  So I got to pick on you again now that you're back.
[1322.86 --> 1323.30]  Let's do it.
[1323.34 --> 1323.68]  Let's do it.
[1323.80 --> 1326.24]  You made one video so far.
[1326.52 --> 1326.68]  Yes.
[1326.68 --> 1328.40]  And it's about Razer's micro console.
[1328.60 --> 1331.50]  And I got to wonder, was that exciting to you?
[1331.50 --> 1331.92]  No, no, no.
[1332.14 --> 1333.18]  Because it's been done before.
[1333.38 --> 1335.98]  Like small Android box connects to your TV over each time.
[1335.98 --> 1336.14]  Okay.
[1336.32 --> 1337.40]  Stop me if you've heard this before.
[1337.66 --> 1338.52]  I've heard this one before.
[1338.58 --> 1338.86]  No, no, no.
[1338.86 --> 1341.52]  The reason I did that video first was I was in the Razer booth.
[1341.52 --> 1342.78]  I was actually waiting.
[1342.94 --> 1344.86]  We were all hanging out and John was shooting videos.
[1345.00 --> 1345.94]  So I had like 30 minutes.
[1346.04 --> 1346.74]  So I started shooting.
[1347.00 --> 1349.50]  I was planning on doing some kind of like laptop roundup or something.
[1349.82 --> 1352.10]  So I started shooting, you know, some of the laptops in the Razer booth.
[1352.38 --> 1354.62]  And then they started talking with me about that.
[1354.70 --> 1355.46]  And so the forge.
[1355.58 --> 1356.88]  So I did a little bit of video on that.
[1357.18 --> 1358.42]  And I started playing around with it.
[1358.48 --> 1359.94]  I'm like, wow, this is actually really solid.
[1359.94 --> 1361.04]  And I started playing with the control.
[1361.16 --> 1362.76]  Like, I really like the feel of these buttons.
[1363.14 --> 1367.24]  And then the turret, I was like, this keyboard magnet, what?
[1367.92 --> 1370.80]  Yeah, so like, it was kind of like I started shooting, shooting, shooting.
[1370.88 --> 1372.22]  And by the end, I was like, yeah, this is a full video.
[1372.54 --> 1373.40]  So it really wasn't planned.
[1373.52 --> 1375.44]  Like, I didn't expect it to be some kind of crazy thing.
[1375.58 --> 1376.82]  But I was actually pretty impressed.
[1376.90 --> 1378.78]  I think the turret's my favorite thing in that video.
[1378.82 --> 1380.50]  Even though, like, it's called Razer Forge TV.
[1380.84 --> 1381.06]  Right.
[1381.30 --> 1382.66]  Did you guys, did you check out the turret?
[1382.98 --> 1383.30]  I, nope.
[1383.52 --> 1385.42]  I didn't even go in the Razer booth.
[1385.88 --> 1386.20]  All right.
[1386.34 --> 1387.12]  You did though, right?
[1387.12 --> 1387.52]  Yeah.
[1387.52 --> 1388.28]  You did a video on it, right?
[1388.40 --> 1388.58]  Yeah.
[1388.58 --> 1393.48]  So basically, the turret is, it's a, like, a little dock with a mouse and keyboard.
[1393.80 --> 1397.42]  So basically, like, it's meant for, like, playing, like, a game or something on, like,
[1397.44 --> 1399.90]  your PC, probably sitting on the couch, like we're doing right now.
[1400.10 --> 1401.08]  So basically, you pull it out.
[1401.22 --> 1404.28]  There's the keyboard and it folds out with a little, like, trackpad.
[1404.42 --> 1405.18]  You take the mouse.
[1405.30 --> 1406.32]  It's about this size.
[1406.40 --> 1407.56]  It's a fairly small mouse.
[1407.66 --> 1407.80]  Yeah.
[1407.88 --> 1409.98]  But it's magnetized to the trackpad lightly.
[1410.30 --> 1412.24]  So you can still, like, it still has good tracking and everything.
[1412.64 --> 1416.34]  But basically, like, you can still, you know, sit here and game without, like, leaning it
[1416.34 --> 1417.98]  and, like, having it completely fall off.
[1417.98 --> 1420.82]  Or on your 8K TV with your crystal clear text.
[1421.00 --> 1421.20]  Right.
[1421.58 --> 1426.00]  You could actually use a massive screen like that from the couch.
[1426.22 --> 1427.10]  That sounds pretty safe.
[1427.14 --> 1427.82]  Which is pretty cool.
[1428.00 --> 1428.16]  Yeah.
[1428.28 --> 1432.18]  It was surprising because, like, I just moved my gaming PC out to my living room.
[1432.48 --> 1434.46]  And I love being able to play on my TV.
[1434.62 --> 1435.78]  Actually, I got a video on that.
[1435.78 --> 1441.10]  But it's not the best having to deal with the mouse and, like, running cables.
[1441.30 --> 1445.04]  And it's, like, it's not really great for sitting on a couch and having to deal with
[1445.04 --> 1446.60]  all that stuff all over the coffee table.
[1446.72 --> 1447.88]  So this looks awesome.
[1449.14 --> 1449.38]  Okay.
[1449.60 --> 1450.62]  Changing gears a little bit.
[1450.70 --> 1451.86]  You guys are camera dorks.
[1452.12 --> 1454.44]  Did you at least find a chance to stop by Parrot?
[1454.44 --> 1457.62]  I was there on our way to Razer.
[1457.72 --> 1461.90]  And I was hypnotized because everyone's standing there with their phones taking videos of it.
[1461.98 --> 1465.16]  So in the 10 minutes it took to walk past Pirate, we took a look.
[1465.20 --> 1468.08]  We saw the, I guess it was a show, basically, of all the drones flying around.
[1468.08 --> 1468.32]  Mm-hmm.
[1468.46 --> 1468.66]  Yeah.
[1468.76 --> 1469.34]  That was pretty cool.
[1469.52 --> 1469.64]  Yeah.
[1469.64 --> 1473.54]  So the Bebop looks like a badass piece of machine.
[1473.78 --> 1474.38]  I missed that.
[1474.48 --> 1474.78]  What is that?
[1474.88 --> 1475.10]  Okay.
[1475.26 --> 1479.10]  So the AR Drone 2.0 is a toy.
[1479.52 --> 1480.36]  It's garbage now.
[1480.36 --> 1480.68]  I don't know.
[1480.80 --> 1480.94]  Right.
[1481.02 --> 1481.12]  Yeah.
[1481.34 --> 1484.90]  It's their, probably going to be their biggest seller, essentially.
[1485.12 --> 1485.34]  Yeah.
[1485.38 --> 1486.98]  Because that's what people are going to see in the commercials.
[1487.14 --> 1491.14]  It's a couple hundred dollars more for the Bebop than it ever was for an AR Drone.
[1491.22 --> 1492.96]  I think those were, those are $300, right, Luke?
[1493.04 --> 1493.22]  Yeah.
[1493.42 --> 1494.06]  AR Drone?
[1494.14 --> 1494.32]  Yeah.
[1495.32 --> 1495.88]  $299?
[1496.00 --> 1496.80]  That sounds about right.
[1496.92 --> 1497.18]  Yeah.
[1497.28 --> 1497.94]  Somewhere like that.
[1497.94 --> 1501.56]  So Bebop is 500 and has some crazy technology.
[1501.70 --> 1502.76]  It's got GPS in it.
[1503.02 --> 1504.82]  They've got a range extender.
[1505.02 --> 1509.00]  So you still control with Wi-Fi, but they've got a range extender that can go to two kilometers.
[1509.46 --> 1509.68]  Whoa.
[1509.94 --> 1513.54]  And it has like actual control knobs and everything.
[1513.84 --> 1513.98]  Yeah.
[1514.06 --> 1517.72]  And you can get a live video feed from two kilometers away flying the Bebop.
[1518.48 --> 1519.82]  Original AR Drone.
[1520.90 --> 1521.30]  Oh, yeah.
[1521.30 --> 1521.58]  Is there a what?
[1522.68 --> 1524.52]  Oh, you can use this.
[1524.82 --> 1525.76]  I'm not doing anything with it.
[1526.16 --> 1526.60]  Okay.
[1526.60 --> 1528.60]  Okay.
[1528.60 --> 1529.48]  So range of two kilometers.
[1529.64 --> 1529.76]  Right.
[1529.86 --> 1532.66]  So the original AR Drone could only go like maybe 12 feet high.
[1533.22 --> 1533.40]  Really?
[1533.40 --> 1533.78]  That's it?
[1533.84 --> 1533.98]  Yeah.
[1534.34 --> 1536.70]  It uses an ultrasonic sensor to know how high it is.
[1536.76 --> 1537.02]  Oh, wow.
[1537.02 --> 1538.52]  So if you went too high, it lost traction.
[1538.90 --> 1539.94]  And it just freaks out.
[1540.02 --> 1540.22]  Yeah.
[1540.32 --> 1541.10]  It's just like, bye.
[1542.32 --> 1542.52]  Wow.
[1542.52 --> 1546.82]  So this one still has that, but it has a pressure sensor as well.
[1547.02 --> 1549.40]  So you can actually fly it up really high.
[1549.40 --> 1552.28]  1080p camera, 180 degree lens.
[1552.28 --> 1554.40]  It has support for Oculus.
[1555.28 --> 1556.32]  So you can wear.
[1556.42 --> 1558.08]  That's pretty cool.
[1558.16 --> 1558.38]  Yeah.
[1558.58 --> 1559.28]  That's pretty cool.
[1559.28 --> 1562.32]  So there's HDMI out on the control module thing.
[1562.78 --> 1566.58]  Can you, is the moving of the head associated with the moving of the camera as well?
[1566.58 --> 1567.66]  Or is it just looking in?
[1567.68 --> 1570.08]  I believe so, but I'm not sure.
[1570.14 --> 1575.90]  Because that would be the ultimate video rig if I'm just standing on the sidewalk and
[1575.90 --> 1577.32]  getting sick shots by myself.
[1577.42 --> 1578.30]  Dude, I remember seeing that video.
[1578.64 --> 1579.32]  That drone video.
[1579.48 --> 1582.60]  I was going to bring up DJI because they're doing a bunch of things with the Inspire.
[1582.60 --> 1585.02]  Yeah, we have a video coming on DJI.
[1585.14 --> 1585.30]  Okay.
[1585.32 --> 1586.52]  The drone is pretty crazy.
[1586.62 --> 1591.34]  I was messing with the Inspire 1 a while ago, which is much bigger and much more expensive
[1591.34 --> 1593.36]  and has a 4K camera and everything.
[1593.60 --> 1596.14]  But controlling it, you need a separate person on a separate controller.
[1596.56 --> 1596.64]  Yeah.
[1596.66 --> 1598.38]  And that was cool if you have two people and you can do that.
[1598.68 --> 1602.48]  But yeah, Oculus on the face with the, I want that.
[1602.94 --> 1603.24]  Yes.
[1603.54 --> 1603.86]  Yeah.
[1604.00 --> 1604.36]  I want that.
[1604.54 --> 1604.84]  Yes.
[1604.88 --> 1606.02]  I totally want that.
[1606.36 --> 1607.06]  So cool.
[1607.90 --> 1609.92]  So that was really cool.
[1609.92 --> 1612.22]  And you guys saw the air show then, right?
[1612.40 --> 1612.56]  Yeah.
[1612.60 --> 1615.06]  I was walking past it, but I saw like the nine or so.
[1615.66 --> 1618.96]  We actually, I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about this.
[1621.06 --> 1622.62]  There's only 3,400 of you.
[1622.84 --> 1624.02]  So should be fine.
[1624.08 --> 1626.90]  As long as you guys each only tell three people.
[1627.48 --> 1628.20]  And it's all good.
[1628.32 --> 1629.04]  Then we should be fine.
[1629.38 --> 1632.50]  They actually took us in the back backstage of the air show.
[1633.14 --> 1634.48]  That place is bananas.
[1634.60 --> 1636.30]  They wouldn't let us take any pictures, no video.
[1636.74 --> 1637.66]  But it's crazy.
[1637.66 --> 1641.18]  They just had drones on drones on drones on drones on drones.
[1641.30 --> 1641.82]  Backup drones.
[1641.82 --> 1642.50]  Backup props.
[1642.54 --> 1642.68]  Yep.
[1642.80 --> 1643.70]  Repair tables.
[1644.08 --> 1645.28]  Like all these parts.
[1645.58 --> 1647.82]  The software that they're using for this thing.
[1648.18 --> 1651.60]  Because the way it works is they had a patterned stage underneath.
[1651.60 --> 1651.82]  Yeah.
[1651.88 --> 1651.94]  Yeah.
[1651.94 --> 1652.08]  Yeah.
[1652.14 --> 1653.72]  It's got to be custom software essentially.
[1653.84 --> 1654.40]  They're building that.
[1654.86 --> 1655.06]  Yeah.
[1655.18 --> 1655.30]  So.
[1655.40 --> 1655.66]  Oh yeah.
[1655.74 --> 1656.40]  The complete.
[1656.52 --> 1657.52]  Oh, full custom.
[1657.68 --> 1657.84]  Yeah.
[1657.84 --> 1660.32]  So the bottom camera is looking at where it is.
[1660.62 --> 1662.78]  And so they're able to do like flips and reorient.
[1662.92 --> 1664.60]  Figure out stay exactly precisely where they were.
[1664.66 --> 1665.10]  Get this.
[1665.98 --> 1667.38]  When they set up the booth for the first.
[1667.74 --> 1669.00]  Oh, I really don't know if I should say this.
[1669.06 --> 1669.16]  Okay.
[1669.16 --> 1670.22]  When they first set up the booth.
[1670.44 --> 1671.18]  It wasn't working.
[1671.84 --> 1672.24]  Yeah.
[1672.24 --> 1675.14]  They were here until 2 or 3 a.m.
[1675.14 --> 1677.12]  The night before the first day of the show.
[1677.32 --> 1680.00]  Because they had it working perfectly back in France.
[1680.34 --> 1682.20]  And you take something like that.
[1682.58 --> 1684.58]  You pack it up on like a plane.
[1684.76 --> 1684.90]  Yeah.
[1685.10 --> 1688.08]  You ship it to Las Vegas.
[1688.30 --> 1688.94]  You unpack it.
[1689.06 --> 1690.10]  Something's going to be different.
[1690.28 --> 1692.48]  If something was slightly misaligned.
[1692.60 --> 1692.78]  Wow.
[1692.80 --> 1694.82]  All of a sudden a drone hits another drone.
[1694.82 --> 1695.58]  Oh no.
[1696.02 --> 1697.50]  Because they don't know where each other are.
[1697.72 --> 1698.68]  That's high stakes stuff.
[1698.78 --> 1701.00]  I was saying like if one drone taps another drone.
[1701.12 --> 1702.12]  It's over for that show.
[1702.64 --> 1704.38]  So you got to be careful with those.
[1704.58 --> 1704.78]  That was awesome.
[1704.78 --> 1705.10]  It's crazy.
[1705.68 --> 1706.36]  But drones are cool.
[1706.60 --> 1707.22]  I was impressed.
[1707.44 --> 1708.00]  Drones are cool.
[1708.40 --> 1708.54]  Yeah.
[1708.60 --> 1709.52]  I'm really excited.
[1709.64 --> 1710.94]  Did you see there's a YouTube video.
[1711.10 --> 1712.22]  I don't know when it was uploaded.
[1712.22 --> 1714.26]  But it's kind of blowing up like yesterday and today.
[1714.26 --> 1715.52]  Oh I haven't seen it for sure.
[1715.52 --> 1715.62]  Of a guy.
[1715.96 --> 1717.10]  It's his first drone flight.
[1717.30 --> 1718.40]  And the DJI drones.
[1718.52 --> 1719.20]  Probably all drones.
[1719.30 --> 1720.22]  When they get low on battery.
[1721.00 --> 1721.64]  Oh yeah.
[1721.64 --> 1724.42]  They just lower themselves to the ground slowly wherever they are.
[1724.56 --> 1726.96]  So it's a shot of a guy flying it over a lake.
[1727.76 --> 1729.36]  And it's pointed back at the shore.
[1729.56 --> 1731.40]  And he slowly starts to see the drone go down.
[1731.50 --> 1733.32]  You see him running and freaking out.
[1733.58 --> 1734.54]  I don't want to spoil it.
[1734.60 --> 1735.58]  But it's one of the best videos.
[1735.98 --> 1736.82]  I'll probably tweet it later.
[1736.90 --> 1738.24]  I already see where this is going.
[1738.54 --> 1738.92]  No no no.
[1739.04 --> 1741.08]  It's an excellent last second stage.
[1741.08 --> 1741.94]  Does it land in a boat?
[1741.94 --> 1744.48]  It's an excellent last second save.
[1744.54 --> 1744.78]  Yes.
[1744.78 --> 1745.26]  It's awesome.
[1745.32 --> 1745.88]  You should do it.
[1746.56 --> 1748.00]  He's leaving it at the right point.
[1748.26 --> 1748.40]  Yeah.
[1748.70 --> 1748.90]  Okay.
[1749.18 --> 1749.78]  It's so cool.
[1750.18 --> 1751.08]  I'll definitely tweet it later.
[1751.30 --> 1751.86]  Alright cool.
[1753.88 --> 1755.26]  DJI's drone was pretty sick.
[1755.32 --> 1756.32]  I think it could go like 60.
[1756.54 --> 1757.30]  Are you tagging me out?
[1757.68 --> 1758.78]  I'm still working here.
[1758.88 --> 1760.04]  So there's no point in tagging you.
[1760.52 --> 1762.34]  But I think it could go like 60 miles an hour.
[1762.56 --> 1762.94]  Inspire 1?
[1763.16 --> 1763.40]  Yeah.
[1763.52 --> 1764.30]  I think it's 75.
[1764.54 --> 1764.92]  75?
[1765.18 --> 1765.36]  Yeah.
[1765.36 --> 1766.16]  That thing's insane.
[1766.16 --> 1770.56]  And then they're like yeah the legal limit for height is 400.
[1770.56 --> 1770.98]  It's limited to 75.
[1771.34 --> 1772.94]  Oh the height is also limited.
[1773.42 --> 1774.98]  When we were messing with it we...
[1774.98 --> 1775.70]  Nah I shouldn't say that.
[1775.72 --> 1776.48]  Yeah you shouldn't say that.
[1776.58 --> 1777.34]  But it was...
[1777.34 --> 1777.56]  Yeah.
[1777.72 --> 1778.22]  The thing is capable.
[1778.22 --> 1779.40]  The legal limit exists.
[1779.98 --> 1780.34]  Absolutely.
[1781.00 --> 1784.20]  He put such a huge like audible disclaimer on legal limit.
[1784.38 --> 1786.96]  Letting me know like it's drastically higher than this.
[1786.96 --> 1787.06]  Yeah.
[1787.44 --> 1789.28]  I think it goes a mile in every direction.
[1789.98 --> 1791.12]  So what's some of your favorite stuff?
[1791.84 --> 1792.88]  What's some of my what sorry?
[1793.08 --> 1794.26]  Some of your favorite stuff from CES.
[1794.26 --> 1798.64]  You know what some of the stuff that I enjoyed was just like I don't know kind of kind of
[1798.64 --> 1799.24]  dumb stuff.
[1799.46 --> 1804.04]  Like we saw the world's smallest and lightest PC motherboard.
[1804.46 --> 1806.50]  It's like 12 grams or something like that.
[1806.76 --> 1808.12]  It's got like 4 gigs of RAM.
[1808.24 --> 1811.00]  It's got an interface on the back that supports a 512 gig SSD.
[1811.16 --> 1811.84]  It's like this big.
[1812.12 --> 1813.16]  They put it on the scale for me.
[1813.20 --> 1814.42]  I'm just like this is stupid.
[1815.08 --> 1815.72]  This is dumb.
[1816.12 --> 1816.96]  It's like it's alright.
[1817.48 --> 1818.32]  Years of engineering.
[1818.82 --> 1819.36]  It's kind of dumb.
[1819.78 --> 1821.72]  I was just like this is ridiculous.
[1821.72 --> 1827.72]  Like the heat sink is literally a piece of copper foil that sits on top of the CPU.
[1828.20 --> 1829.44]  Alright that is a little ridiculous.
[1830.02 --> 1830.72]  I like this is awesome.
[1830.80 --> 1833.74]  They're like yeah this thing turbos to like 2.6 gigahertz.
[1833.90 --> 1834.54]  It's a dual core.
[1835.16 --> 1835.76]  Dual core what?
[1836.02 --> 1837.68]  It's a core i5 whatever.
[1837.84 --> 1839.42]  No this is like no this is Broadwell.
[1839.82 --> 1841.90]  This is like some serious business.
[1842.84 --> 1843.04]  Wow.
[1843.50 --> 1844.26]  Where is this going to go in?
[1844.60 --> 1845.26]  Pack it up for you.
[1845.26 --> 1845.46]  Ultrabooks.
[1845.78 --> 1846.20]  Ultrabooks.
[1846.34 --> 1846.78]  Tablets.
[1846.78 --> 1852.52]  Asus had like these hyper thin tablets that sit in the keyboard dock like they do.
[1852.92 --> 1857.54]  But they were like super thin x86 based full windows 8.1.
[1857.82 --> 1860.72]  I saw a TV from Sony right?
[1860.96 --> 1861.36]  Sony?
[1861.64 --> 1862.08]  It was Sony.
[1862.22 --> 1863.84]  The 4.6 million would need a one right?
[1864.08 --> 1864.30]  Yeah.
[1864.56 --> 1867.48]  And I walked up to it and I guess lose the bend guy.
[1867.78 --> 1870.06]  But if you want to tap me out if you want.
[1870.14 --> 1873.96]  But you walk up to the TV and you can literally grab it with two fingers and just twist it.
[1873.96 --> 1877.08]  And it's still an LED panel and you can move it around.
[1877.22 --> 1879.30]  It looked really good but it was very thin.
[1879.38 --> 1881.02]  So I think there's a solution to that.
[1881.36 --> 1882.70]  We stopped by Corning.
[1883.08 --> 1885.00]  Corning usually has awesome demos.
[1885.46 --> 1885.62]  Yeah.
[1885.86 --> 1888.54]  And this year they didn't have anything practical.
[1888.80 --> 1889.56]  I think I'm in right now.
[1889.64 --> 1890.60]  I can be here and be in.
[1890.82 --> 1895.98]  We couldn't just kind of like drop stuff on Gorilla Glass like I've done in the past.
[1895.98 --> 1902.10]  But this year they were showing off a TV that doesn't have a plastic diffusion layer.
[1902.76 --> 1909.42]  So for an edge lit TV normally you'd need a plastic diffuser in order to get the evenness in the backlight.
[1909.62 --> 1915.44]  So they've developed a new glass that emits light evenly over the entire surface.
[1915.44 --> 1919.34]  Instead of you light it at one end and it's really bright and at the other end it's really pale.
[1919.50 --> 1927.28]  So they were saying that this will enable thinner TVs because with plastic you have to put a lot more structural components in.
[1927.36 --> 1933.48]  With glass you actually add a lot of structural strength and it can be hyper thin.
[1933.94 --> 1934.26]  Wow.
[1934.26 --> 1937.18]  They also had that wire I was telling you about.
[1937.34 --> 1944.74]  They had glass filament optical fiber that instead of being designed to hold the light in is designed to let the light out evenly.
[1944.86 --> 1948.20]  It's so light they had a helium balloon floating on.
[1949.20 --> 1952.26]  And so you put a laser in one end and it glows.
[1952.32 --> 1956.00]  They had a guitar that you strum and it's all winding the guitar.
[1956.10 --> 1956.44]  It was sick.
[1956.56 --> 1957.64]  There's some cool stuff like that.
[1957.80 --> 1960.92]  We were over at the Sharp booth and started looking around.
[1961.00 --> 1962.54]  They had some crazy displays all over the place.
[1962.56 --> 1963.56]  I didn't see Sharp at all.
[1963.56 --> 1967.44]  Sharp had I think one of the better booths for the panel stuff.
[1967.54 --> 1968.22]  I mean there's TVs everywhere.
[1968.72 --> 1974.24]  But you see in the Sharp Aquos Crystal which has those minimal displays on the top right and left.
[1975.10 --> 1975.56]  It's a phone.
[1975.82 --> 1976.56]  Yeah it's a phone.
[1976.56 --> 1983.56]  And they had other examples of using that bezel-less technology in car displays and other shapes displays.
[1984.30 --> 1986.06]  A circular version of that with no bezel.
[1986.66 --> 1987.60]  Like gauges and curtains.
[1987.60 --> 1991.64]  A random other shape of it for a car dashboard and examples of things like that.
[1991.94 --> 1992.46]  It looked pretty cool.
[1992.54 --> 1993.38]  I have videos of that too.
[1993.56 --> 1994.04]  It's going to be awesome.
[1994.38 --> 1994.56]  Yeah.
[1994.68 --> 1996.32]  And there was also the...
[1996.32 --> 1996.68]  What was it?
[1996.88 --> 1997.32]  89?
[1998.32 --> 1998.68]  80?
[1999.02 --> 1999.52]  What was that?
[1999.56 --> 2000.24]  The 89 inch?
[2000.24 --> 2001.58]  The 89 inch 8K TV.
[2001.82 --> 2002.02]  Yeah.
[2002.02 --> 2003.30]  And the 98 inch 8K TV.
[2003.54 --> 2003.70]  Yeah.
[2003.94 --> 2004.82]  So they had those.
[2004.92 --> 2007.94]  They had a completely bendable display that was like wrapped around a pole.
[2008.12 --> 2009.02]  I don't know if it's bendable.
[2009.16 --> 2009.56]  I think it was just...
[2009.56 --> 2009.86]  Oh yeah.
[2009.96 --> 2010.22]  I'm sorry.
[2010.22 --> 2011.22]  It was just...
[2011.22 --> 2012.72]  That's the shape it was made.
[2013.00 --> 2013.22]  Right.
[2013.22 --> 2013.40]  Right.
[2013.40 --> 2013.48]  Right.
[2013.48 --> 2017.14]  They were showing off that they can make displays in all these different forms and shapes.
[2017.40 --> 2019.06]  And they had one wrapped around a pole.
[2019.74 --> 2020.52]  Which was interesting.
[2020.86 --> 2021.04]  Right.
[2021.04 --> 2023.68]  So it reminded me of like the Times Square as you see except in actual TV.
[2023.96 --> 2024.14]  Right.
[2024.30 --> 2024.32]  Yeah.
[2024.50 --> 2024.96]  Really cool.
[2024.96 --> 2025.96]  So...
[2025.96 --> 2028.54]  I'm actually pretty excited about HDMI 2.0.
[2028.56 --> 2029.28]  I'll probably just cap you.
[2029.28 --> 2029.56]  Woo!
[2030.14 --> 2030.50]  Yeah.
[2030.64 --> 2031.74]  So that's fine.
[2031.84 --> 2032.60]  Maybe not that excited.
[2033.18 --> 2033.78]  I'm sorry?
[2034.04 --> 2035.02]  Maybe not quite that excited.
[2035.14 --> 2035.42]  Party time.
[2035.50 --> 2035.74]  No.
[2035.84 --> 2035.98]  No.
[2036.10 --> 2036.34]  I'm...
[2036.34 --> 2036.46]  Okay.
[2038.60 --> 2039.60]  HDMI 2.0.
[2039.66 --> 2041.38]  No one can be as excited as you are.
[2041.50 --> 2043.22]  I'm pretty excited.
[2043.34 --> 2043.88]  Very soon.
[2044.00 --> 2044.66]  Jif or Gif?
[2044.96 --> 2047.46]  I say Jif because that's the way it's said to be said.
[2047.68 --> 2048.46]  Jif is peanut butter.
[2048.52 --> 2050.76]  I don't remember how I said it before that thing.
[2050.88 --> 2052.12]  That whole article.
[2052.90 --> 2054.34]  I don't remember how I said it before then.
[2054.40 --> 2054.64]  All right.
[2054.64 --> 2055.84]  We won't get into this one.
[2056.18 --> 2056.38]  All right.
[2057.84 --> 2058.32]  Yeah.
[2058.62 --> 2059.66]  HDMI 2.0.
[2061.08 --> 2062.10]  I dance a lot.
[2062.82 --> 2063.74]  HDMI 2.0.
[2064.12 --> 2064.50]  Thank you.
[2064.82 --> 2065.18]  Actually, yeah.
[2065.18 --> 2066.72]  HDMI 2.0 because I have...
[2066.72 --> 2068.70]  There's a Vizio TV that has HDMI 2.0.
[2068.80 --> 2072.18]  So I had a 970 hooked up to a 50-inch Vizio 4K TV.
[2072.34 --> 2073.22]  HDMI 2.0.
[2073.52 --> 2074.56]  4K, 60 hertz.
[2075.00 --> 2075.20]  Dope.
[2075.92 --> 2076.10]  Yeah.
[2076.20 --> 2076.36]  Dope.
[2077.10 --> 2077.26]  Yeah.
[2077.38 --> 2080.72]  Not that terribly meaningful for...
[2080.72 --> 2082.56]  Actually, this is something I get...
[2082.56 --> 2087.16]  My audience in particular is begging and pleading me to do 60 hertz videos.
[2087.66 --> 2087.94]  Yeah.
[2087.94 --> 2089.30]  60 hertz videos.
[2089.30 --> 2089.40]  Yeah.
[2089.40 --> 2089.44]  Yeah.
[2089.44 --> 2089.54]  Yeah.
[2089.54 --> 2090.30]  But it's okay.
[2090.30 --> 2093.50]  And something that I want to kind of address here.
[2093.50 --> 2099.22]  And maybe if I have such credible gentlemen here in the room with me to back me up on this,
[2099.30 --> 2100.68]  you guys might actually believe it.
[2101.18 --> 2103.48]  60 hertz is great for gaming.
[2103.82 --> 2104.08]  Yes.
[2104.08 --> 2105.50]  It's great for viewing gameplay.
[2105.50 --> 2106.00]  Yes.
[2106.00 --> 2106.90]  Thank you.
[2107.00 --> 2107.34]  Thank you.
[2107.40 --> 2111.90]  A 60 hertz display with 60 FPS content is great for gaming.
[2111.90 --> 2114.24]  It is great for viewing gaming content.
[2114.40 --> 2116.38]  And it's great for sporting events.
[2116.56 --> 2117.76]  Very high speed.
[2117.86 --> 2119.40]  Very high speed imagery.
[2120.12 --> 2125.30]  For something like him sitting in his room talking like this.
[2125.68 --> 2129.46]  Now, I'm going to kind of drop a bombshell here.
[2129.72 --> 2129.94]  Okay.
[2130.00 --> 2130.14]  I'm ready.
[2130.14 --> 2132.92]  We uploaded a video at 60 FPS.
[2133.08 --> 2133.98]  Bombshell time.
[2134.58 --> 2135.58]  About a month ago.
[2136.16 --> 2136.34]  Okay.
[2136.76 --> 2138.72]  And everyone freaked out in the video.
[2138.82 --> 2140.28]  They're like, this is so great.
[2140.90 --> 2141.68]  Oh, what?
[2142.00 --> 2145.74]  It was 60, it was 60 FPS, or it was 30 FPS content.
[2146.06 --> 2148.18]  And I just exported it at 60 FPS.
[2148.48 --> 2149.26]  That placebo.
[2149.74 --> 2149.78]  Oh.
[2150.18 --> 2151.84]  Nobody caught it.
[2152.04 --> 2152.24]  Wow.
[2152.42 --> 2152.74]  Oh.
[2153.62 --> 2154.92]  You can't make frames.
[2154.98 --> 2155.68]  Those are pretty big balls.
[2155.68 --> 2156.20]  Whoa.
[2156.20 --> 2156.68]  Wow.
[2157.00 --> 2158.40]  I mean, that says a lot, though.
[2158.60 --> 2161.94]  Because, yeah, I would have looked very carefully into those comments.
[2162.06 --> 2163.36]  I feel like I want to go back and find that now.
[2163.50 --> 2168.00]  But, like, people ask me all the time, when are you going to start doing 60 frames for checking videos?
[2168.16 --> 2168.46]  So, hang on.
[2168.72 --> 2169.24]  I don't think they're...
[2169.24 --> 2172.04]  Have any of you guys here seen the Hobbit in 48 frames?
[2172.60 --> 2174.56]  I haven't actually...
[2174.56 --> 2179.84]  I saw the Hobbit 1 in 3D, and I was so disappointed that I didn't bother seeing Hobbit 2 in 3D.
[2179.84 --> 2183.46]  I saw it in 2D, and I haven't seen Hobbit 3 because Hobbit 2 was terrible.
[2183.82 --> 2184.84]  Hobbit 3 is better than Hobbit 2.
[2184.84 --> 2185.60]  But...
[2185.60 --> 2190.84]  That's like saying that this dog shit sandwich tastes better than, like, the cow shit sandwich.
[2190.86 --> 2192.60]  I would say the Hobbit...
[2192.60 --> 2194.68]  It's going to be great when someone cuts into a 2-hour movie.
[2194.76 --> 2196.62]  Tastes all 3 and cuts into a 2-hour movie.
[2196.80 --> 2197.24]  Yes.
[2197.58 --> 2197.88]  Anyway.
[2198.22 --> 2198.90]  That's it.
[2198.98 --> 2199.60]  Back to 60.
[2199.98 --> 2202.42]  So, if you guys aren't familiar, let's get it.
[2203.74 --> 2207.18]  All right, all right.
[2207.72 --> 2208.20]  All right.
[2208.28 --> 2209.52]  I'm getting kicked off my...
[2209.52 --> 2209.80]  Okay.
[2210.28 --> 2212.52]  So, have you guys seen The Hobbit?
[2212.64 --> 2212.80]  Yeah.
[2212.98 --> 2213.28]  Yes.
[2213.60 --> 2213.92]  I have not.
[2213.92 --> 2214.36]  You have not?
[2214.36 --> 2214.56]  Okay.
[2214.62 --> 2214.96]  I've seen all 3.
[2215.12 --> 2216.22]  What did you think of the first one?
[2217.48 --> 2218.88]  Way too long, but okay.
[2219.56 --> 2220.36]  And then the second one?
[2220.38 --> 2220.66]  Awful.
[2220.94 --> 2221.52]  Third one?
[2221.88 --> 2222.26]  Not bad.
[2222.56 --> 2222.86]  Right?
[2223.28 --> 2223.62]  Yes.
[2223.62 --> 2225.32]  I felt the exact same way.
[2225.66 --> 2228.88]  The first two were elongated garbage.
[2229.26 --> 2229.62]  Yes.
[2229.84 --> 2230.32]  Unfortunately.
[2230.32 --> 2231.32]  Even though I love...
[2231.32 --> 2232.00]  Extra storylines.
[2232.12 --> 2232.92]  All kinds of just...
[2232.92 --> 2233.12]  Oh.
[2233.62 --> 2238.62]  Like, they were enjoyable in parts, but there's just so many things that just, like, pulled
[2238.62 --> 2239.44]  you right out of the story.
[2239.44 --> 2239.72]  Yes.
[2239.72 --> 2241.24]  Like, why is this happening?
[2241.58 --> 2241.72]  Yeah.
[2241.78 --> 2245.40]  Why are dwarves able to fight this well against all these other things?
[2245.40 --> 2246.00]  It's like...
[2246.00 --> 2247.76]  Has anyone seen The Hobbit on a tag?
[2248.18 --> 2248.50]  Yeah.
[2248.84 --> 2249.86]  What's happening right now?
[2252.14 --> 2252.40]  Okay.
[2252.40 --> 2252.90]  Okay.
[2252.90 --> 2253.98]  As long as you can come back now.
[2254.04 --> 2254.40]  No, no, no.
[2254.46 --> 2255.86]  We're talking about 60fps video.
[2255.98 --> 2256.60]  Oh, 60fps.
[2256.72 --> 2256.90]  Yeah.
[2256.90 --> 2257.82]  You can probably talk about that.
[2258.00 --> 2262.42]  So, that's why I brought up Hobbit, because I thought Hobbit was actually pretty decent.
[2262.42 --> 2263.24]  Did you watch the 48th?
[2263.24 --> 2265.42]  I watched the first one in 48, and I enjoyed it.
[2265.42 --> 2267.46]  I could tell it wasn't...
[2267.46 --> 2267.70]  Okay.
[2267.78 --> 2268.74]  It was still a little weird, right?
[2268.74 --> 2268.80]  Yeah.
[2268.80 --> 2271.82]  It almost felt like if you watched, like, an early, like, movie or something...
[2271.82 --> 2274.36]  It's like watching one of those, like, Spanish TV, like...
[2274.36 --> 2274.90]  Like a soap opera.
[2275.08 --> 2275.42]  Soap opera.
[2275.42 --> 2275.62]  Yeah.
[2275.78 --> 2276.26]  One of those.
[2276.42 --> 2277.28]  And it's distracting.
[2277.28 --> 2277.88]  It feels far too real.
[2277.88 --> 2279.26]  And it feels like a different genre.
[2279.62 --> 2279.96]  It's a different genre.
[2279.96 --> 2280.24]  I don't know.
[2280.32 --> 2281.02]  Is it real, though?
[2281.08 --> 2281.64]  Well, no.
[2281.82 --> 2282.50]  Like, to me...
[2282.50 --> 2282.66]  Okay.
[2282.76 --> 2290.88]  To me, 48 frames per second, and anything higher than 24 or 30, even 30 to a degree, it just...
[2290.88 --> 2292.32]  Like, cinema...
[2292.32 --> 2295.30]  Like, if you're talking about a feature film, not like a YouTube video,
[2295.30 --> 2300.32]  but a feature film, you're there to, like, get immersed in that storyline, right?
[2300.32 --> 2300.78]  That's what you mean.
[2300.78 --> 2302.60]  So it no longer...
[2302.60 --> 2303.76]  It becomes a distraction.
[2303.84 --> 2304.20]  Exactly.
[2304.54 --> 2304.88]  Exactly.
[2305.12 --> 2306.38]  Like, and the frame rate should...
[2306.38 --> 2310.32]  Any technical aspect of the movie should not be taking out of the story.
[2310.34 --> 2313.44]  It's like if you shot a whole video at F0.95.
[2313.88 --> 2314.08]  Yeah.
[2314.30 --> 2314.78]  And it's like...
[2314.78 --> 2315.42]  Nothing's in focus.
[2315.44 --> 2317.60]  Everyone's noses are in focus and their faces are out.
[2317.68 --> 2317.80]  Yeah.
[2317.88 --> 2319.04]  It just doesn't look like...
[2319.04 --> 2323.32]  It's distracting again, and it takes you out of the story.
[2323.32 --> 2325.32]  And it's a technical feat, sure.
[2325.72 --> 2327.60]  But does that mean it's better?
[2327.94 --> 2328.30]  Unnecessary.
[2328.30 --> 2332.16]  I don't want to check anyone else out, but I have a question for the fan guys.
[2332.28 --> 2332.44]  Okay.
[2332.44 --> 2334.26]  It's something I'm not super educated on.
[2335.58 --> 2336.46]  Lord of the Rings.
[2336.82 --> 2336.98]  Yes.
[2336.98 --> 2337.56]  Peter Jackson.
[2337.74 --> 2337.86]  Yes.
[2337.86 --> 2340.02]  Known for, like, crazy mountain pan shots.
[2340.14 --> 2340.28]  Yes.
[2340.28 --> 2344.00]  In the mountain pan shot in two towers at 24 FPS, my brain leads.
[2344.00 --> 2351.34]  And in the new one, when he pans through the mountain and it shows all the gold, when he's
[2351.34 --> 2355.64]  doing a really quick pan of all the gold, it just looks disgusting.
[2355.82 --> 2356.28]  It's like...
[2356.28 --> 2356.70]  Yes.
[2357.12 --> 2360.20]  So I feel like part of that is just because 48 FPS...
[2360.20 --> 2360.98]  Is that his fault?
[2361.40 --> 2361.72]  Or...
[2361.72 --> 2361.92]  No.
[2361.92 --> 2363.50]  I feel like high frame rate stuff is new.
[2363.68 --> 2366.06]  I feel like it's not figured out yet.
[2366.06 --> 2370.70]  Like, there have been high frame rate videos, but, like, it's never really been, like, really
[2370.70 --> 2372.62]  worked out as far as, like, for movies.
[2372.74 --> 2373.66]  Like, this is a fairly new thing.
[2373.78 --> 2374.78]  So, I want to give you a little bit of it.
[2374.78 --> 2375.30]  Because, like, usually it's fine.
[2375.42 --> 2376.98]  It's just those, like, those two kind of shots.
[2377.08 --> 2377.18]  Yeah.
[2377.18 --> 2377.28]  Yeah.
[2377.48 --> 2378.30]  So quick pans.
[2378.30 --> 2381.46]  When you pan at a higher frame rate, you also have to shoot at a higher shutter speed.
[2381.98 --> 2382.14]  Yes.
[2382.14 --> 2386.70]  And when you pan at a high shutter speed, things become jittery and choppy and weird.
[2387.08 --> 2391.12]  So those big sweeping shots might look cool at 24 when everything's nice and smooth.
[2391.64 --> 2392.12]  But when you start...
[2392.12 --> 2394.18]  It's actually 24 FPS and I'm concerned.
[2394.18 --> 2395.34]  I'm making room for Burko.
[2395.40 --> 2395.90]  Burko, come here.
[2395.90 --> 2396.62]  It's a weird-looking...
[2396.62 --> 2397.02]  Bring it in.
[2397.02 --> 2397.46]  Bring it in.
[2397.98 --> 2398.54]  It's a big couch.
[2398.94 --> 2401.26]  I don't move the 11.
[2401.44 --> 2401.92]  For someone.
[2402.04 --> 2402.64]  I don't know who.
[2402.86 --> 2403.70]  Just join.
[2403.84 --> 2404.08]  Just join.
[2404.08 --> 2405.20]  Bring it in.
[2405.20 --> 2405.62]  Bring it in.
[2406.36 --> 2410.10]  So, I feel like 60 FPS video looks awesome.
[2410.34 --> 2412.46]  Like Linus is saying, gameplay is great.
[2412.60 --> 2417.70]  But for, like, a normal YouTube video of, like, pacing in, like, in front of my desk,
[2417.94 --> 2419.92]  like, my face doesn't look that much better than 60 FPS.
[2420.70 --> 2422.62]  It looks a little bit better, but not that much.
[2422.76 --> 2425.24]  For the amount of data you have to add in each of you have to...
[2425.24 --> 2427.96]  To make it, you know, an efficient workflow.
[2428.24 --> 2429.12]  Well, yeah, that's the other thing.
[2429.12 --> 2430.30]  You're just adding...
[2430.30 --> 2430.66]  I don't know.
[2430.66 --> 2433.56]  You're really putting a burden on yourself if you're adding 60 frames.
[2433.56 --> 2436.22]  For what sort of difference, really, right?
[2436.30 --> 2436.46]  So...
[2436.46 --> 2439.34]  Well, and the other thing that a lot of people might not know if you don't use a camera,
[2439.34 --> 2443.62]  like, really often, you're not really diving into it, is when you shoot at a higher frame
[2443.62 --> 2446.16]  rate, you need a higher shutter speed, and you need more light.
[2446.54 --> 2446.80]  Yes.
[2446.80 --> 2450.68]  And all of those things add up to, oh, man, this experience is not...
[2450.68 --> 2452.52]  This is, like, this is throwing me off.
[2452.64 --> 2453.86]  And that's why I think...
[2453.86 --> 2459.10]  Like, it's a creative choice for Peter Jackson to do an aerial that's so fast that it's
[2459.10 --> 2460.84]  hard for people to kind of register it.
[2460.90 --> 2461.62]  That's his choice.
[2461.90 --> 2464.80]  He could do it differently to make it a little bit easier on the eyes.
[2464.80 --> 2468.00]  Can we just pause for a second and say that we mentioned 60 FPS video, and now we're
[2468.00 --> 2469.78]  like a bunch of Lord of the Rings nerds arguing?
[2470.36 --> 2472.20]  Can we just, like, the winch that was descended...
[2472.20 --> 2472.92]  It's a cinematic discussion.
[2473.02 --> 2474.90]  Blinders stood up for 30 seconds, guys.
[2475.04 --> 2478.56]  We took over for 30 seconds, and now we're, like, complete nerd.
[2479.06 --> 2479.88]  Right off track.
[2480.08 --> 2481.04]  I feel like I gotta tag out.
[2481.20 --> 2482.96]  I will tag out and take one for the team here.
[2483.42 --> 2484.56]  All right, so what's the topic now?
[2485.14 --> 2485.84]  You just take one.
[2486.44 --> 2487.12]  I don't...
[2487.12 --> 2488.16]  I think you gotta lead this.
[2488.44 --> 2489.18]  The topic now?
[2489.26 --> 2489.70]  This is...
[2489.70 --> 2490.98]  All righty, man.
[2491.20 --> 2491.62]  I'll...
[2491.62 --> 2493.84]  I'm just gonna read the chat until I follow the new topic.
[2494.80 --> 2495.02]  Yeah.
[2495.52 --> 2497.02]  That's the hell, Nick, MLG.
[2497.48 --> 2498.14]  Thank you.
[2500.66 --> 2502.08]  Oh, it said LMG.
[2502.18 --> 2502.60]  Never mind.
[2502.70 --> 2503.54]  That's a different one.
[2503.82 --> 2507.08]  I do like high frame rate video when it's slowed down, though.
[2507.26 --> 2508.30]  I can take advantage of it.
[2508.30 --> 2508.94]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2509.10 --> 2509.68]  I had some stuff.
[2510.18 --> 2516.58]  The BMW i3, when it was avoiding crashing, and I was shot at, like, 90 frames a second,
[2516.58 --> 2520.80]  and I do everything at 30, so basically have the car going towards the barrier full screen,
[2521.32 --> 2524.78]  and you're full speed, you see it avoid crashing, and then I replay.
[2524.80 --> 2526.02]  I don't know if you saw a shout-out.
[2526.02 --> 2528.40]  You can see the people in the car, like, shift forward.
[2528.52 --> 2530.22]  You can see a little bit of the tire shifting.
[2530.96 --> 2531.54]  It's cool.
[2531.72 --> 2533.34]  It's cool to see that kind of stuff when you slow it down.
[2533.34 --> 2538.52]  Slow motion is ridiculously awesome, because, like, the amount of things that you can see
[2538.52 --> 2540.16]  that you would never be able to see in real life.
[2540.30 --> 2540.44]  Yeah.
[2540.44 --> 2541.02]  Like, if you...
[2541.02 --> 2541.58]  Like, the Phantom.
[2541.94 --> 2542.44]  Little details.
[2542.44 --> 2542.74]  Oh, my God.
[2542.74 --> 2543.24]  Yeah.
[2543.24 --> 2544.54]  Like, 500 frames per second, 2,500 frames per second.
[2544.54 --> 2544.56]  Yeah.
[2544.56 --> 2545.32]  I can't resign at a level.
[2545.32 --> 2548.80]  The things that you can do with that thing, just in, like, literally, you cannot see that
[2548.80 --> 2549.30]  with your eyes.
[2549.46 --> 2549.50]  Mm-hmm.
[2549.66 --> 2551.04]  Your eyes will not be able to see that.
[2551.14 --> 2555.14]  I feel the same way from slow-mo about time-lapse, too.
[2555.20 --> 2558.94]  It's like, you can't see a time-lapse with your eyes, like, just in everyday life.
[2559.04 --> 2559.16]  Exactly.
[2559.16 --> 2561.34]  You can't see something be faster than it usually is.
[2561.34 --> 2564.62]  But then when you see a time-lapse of, like, the clouds or something like that, it's just
[2564.62 --> 2566.02]  this, like, phenomenon.
[2566.34 --> 2566.94]  It's incredible.
[2567.14 --> 2567.30]  Yeah.
[2567.44 --> 2568.46]  And that's just really...
[2568.46 --> 2571.26]  These 8K TVs, there's no 8K video to show on a lot of them.
[2571.50 --> 2574.28]  But in order to make an 8K video, they show a lot of these time-lapses.
[2574.32 --> 2574.50]  Yeah.
[2574.50 --> 2575.22]  Like, 28-megars of photos.
[2575.22 --> 2577.44]  From, like, a large-format camera or something, right?
[2577.44 --> 2577.50]  Exactly.
[2577.50 --> 2582.74]  So they're rolling through these 8K images, and it's just surreal looking at, like, the whole
[2582.74 --> 2586.90]  city for a whole day as the clouds roll by and the lights change in 8K.
[2587.04 --> 2587.56]  It's just crazy.
[2587.94 --> 2589.62]  Like, just like you're looking outside right now.
[2589.72 --> 2589.96]  Yeah.
[2590.22 --> 2591.08]  Yeah, it's pretty insane.
[2591.34 --> 2594.44]  And you actually said you noticed, like, an actual difference between...
[2594.44 --> 2595.00]  I think I...
[2595.00 --> 2595.24]  Yeah.
[2595.24 --> 2596.00]  Significant 8K.
[2596.32 --> 2598.52]  Well, at that size, like...
[2598.52 --> 2599.86]  It was an 89-inch TV.
[2599.98 --> 2600.12]  Right.
[2600.12 --> 2602.04]  Where I looked at it, I was like, that looks better.
[2602.12 --> 2605.86]  When you're seeing something like 42-inch or something like that, I don't think you're
[2605.86 --> 2606.04]  going to look.
[2606.14 --> 2606.50]  Exactly.
[2606.72 --> 2607.54]  Can I really tell?
[2608.38 --> 2610.06]  15 feet away from it, looking at it.
[2610.32 --> 2611.62]  Depends on how far you sit from it.
[2611.66 --> 2612.56]  Depends on how big it is.
[2613.10 --> 2617.94]  But, yeah, I feel like if I'm putting it on a wall way over there, I might not notice that
[2617.94 --> 2618.32]  difference.
[2619.02 --> 2620.02]  It's all about the distance.
[2620.02 --> 2622.50]  And, like, there's, like, always an optimal...
[2622.50 --> 2623.80]  Especially with a lot of the curved TVs.
[2623.96 --> 2628.24]  Unless you're, like, directly in the exact spot, you're not really getting a better...
[2628.24 --> 2631.48]  Although I did see one manufacturer claiming that was better for...
[2631.48 --> 2632.02]  Okay.
[2633.32 --> 2636.70]  There's one curved TV that I kind of get.
[2636.80 --> 2637.48]  Do you want to take me out?
[2637.48 --> 2639.16]  No, no, I'm playing.
[2641.16 --> 2641.48]  Crap.
[2641.62 --> 2642.70]  I forget who it was.
[2642.80 --> 2644.78]  They showed it last year as well.
[2645.20 --> 2646.36]  But, basically, they...
[2646.36 --> 2647.86]  Okay, I got mixed messages.
[2648.12 --> 2648.68]  Mixed messages.
[2649.24 --> 2653.00]  But they were saying that one person told me that you could actually change the curve.
[2653.08 --> 2654.18]  So, it's that flexible TV.
[2654.50 --> 2655.24]  Who says that again?
[2655.66 --> 2656.02]  Sammy?
[2656.28 --> 2656.60]  Samson?
[2656.60 --> 2657.00]  I think that...
[2657.00 --> 2657.54]  Yeah, you're right.
[2657.56 --> 2658.04]  I want to say it was Sammy.
[2658.12 --> 2658.26]  Yeah.
[2658.40 --> 2659.14]  I hadn't heard about that.
[2659.16 --> 2660.34]  So, you can curve it all the way.
[2660.72 --> 2662.40]  And then you can uncurve it all the way.
[2662.48 --> 2663.70]  That's a prototype one that they have there.
[2663.76 --> 2665.84]  And someone told me that you might be able to stop in between.
[2666.74 --> 2667.86]  So, that would be super cool.
[2668.06 --> 2669.98]  You could go flat if you've got, like, ten guys over.
[2670.14 --> 2672.04]  You could go all the way curved if you're watching by yourself.
[2672.20 --> 2672.40]  Right.
[2672.40 --> 2677.82]  I guess if you're that into the curve and you have to have it for yourself, then that
[2677.82 --> 2678.56]  would be a good option.
[2678.64 --> 2679.32]  Good middle ground.
[2679.76 --> 2679.88]  Yeah.
[2680.32 --> 2680.84]  I don't know.
[2680.88 --> 2683.18]  I have a curved TV, but I never watch it with ten people.
[2683.30 --> 2684.16]  It's usually one or two.
[2684.28 --> 2685.96]  So, we just sit in the middle of the couch and it's fine.
[2686.18 --> 2689.44]  But I saw, like, a curved TV, like, on one of these rotating stands.
[2689.60 --> 2691.98]  And it was saying, look at how many more viewing angles there are.
[2692.04 --> 2693.76]  And it just twisted the TV around.
[2693.84 --> 2695.30]  And you're like, I guess I could see that.
[2695.54 --> 2697.32]  There wasn't any color shift as it got to the edges.
[2697.54 --> 2697.68]  Yeah.
[2698.54 --> 2699.38]  Maybe it's a benefit.
[2699.50 --> 2699.76]  I don't know.
[2699.76 --> 2706.44]  Well, actually, one of the really early, I read an article recently, and Sony is actually
[2706.44 --> 2710.66]  making curved sensors for, like, they're developed.
[2710.86 --> 2715.82]  It's not, it's, like, super early, not even, like, they haven't even found the perfect use
[2715.82 --> 2716.04]  case.
[2716.14 --> 2721.04]  But I think the idea is that the way that if you can curve a sensor, you can build a
[2721.04 --> 2724.30]  lot more, like, technical stabilization.
[2724.62 --> 2726.82]  Because Sony's got their five-axis stabilization.
[2726.82 --> 2729.76]  I'm thinking of what benefits that would have over just different glass.
[2730.04 --> 2730.20]  Yeah.
[2730.34 --> 2733.94]  Like, what would a curved, what would an image from a curved sensor look like?
[2734.00 --> 2734.78]  Would it just be distorted?
[2735.34 --> 2735.68]  I don't know.
[2735.82 --> 2738.74]  Would it be something like it's in a ball where it's brought back after?
[2739.58 --> 2740.24]  I don't know.
[2740.24 --> 2740.92]  It's super impressive.
[2740.92 --> 2746.64]  But it's interesting, because, like, the article went on about how, I think, in that technology,
[2746.88 --> 2751.34]  they've somehow managed to figure out how to gather more actual light than you can with
[2751.34 --> 2751.88]  a flat sensor.
[2752.04 --> 2753.30]  I don't know how they did that.
[2753.64 --> 2760.04]  And that's, again, application is kind of, and it's not just more light.
[2760.04 --> 2762.76]  It's, like, they're getting crazy amounts of dynamic range.
[2763.08 --> 2764.34]  Like, 25 stops.
[2765.46 --> 2768.12]  Like, can you even think, can you fathom 25 stops?
[2769.12 --> 2769.28]  Great.
[2769.56 --> 2769.76]  I'm kidding.
[2769.92 --> 2770.62]  Holy crap.
[2771.18 --> 2775.00]  Well, hopefully NCES in the next couple of hours will be seeing something like that.
[2775.00 --> 2775.86]  Yeah, 2017.
[2776.40 --> 2776.90]  Or NAB.
[2777.74 --> 2778.40]  Oh, yeah.
[2778.66 --> 2779.32]  Have you ever been to NAB?
[2779.88 --> 2780.38]  No, no, no.
[2780.38 --> 2781.30]  I guess you go to NAB.
[2781.36 --> 2781.64]  NAB.
[2782.00 --> 2782.34]  Let's go.
[2782.50 --> 2782.96]  Let's go to NAB.
[2782.96 --> 2783.70]  Yeah, let's just go right now.
[2783.86 --> 2785.58]  We're in, just wait here until April.
[2785.58 --> 2788.74]  I like how this has totally been hijacked from, you know.
[2788.86 --> 2790.00]  Yeah, there's not even, there's no.
[2790.46 --> 2792.60]  Like a PC, electronic slasher.
[2792.90 --> 2793.70]  Yeah, we're going to take that.
[2793.98 --> 2794.62]  Thanks, everyone.
[2794.76 --> 2794.98]  See ya.
[2795.10 --> 2795.76]  Can't go away.
[2795.86 --> 2796.64]  No more cameras.
[2796.88 --> 2797.52]  We take over.
[2797.68 --> 2797.94]  All right.
[2798.02 --> 2798.76]  Just Austin and I.
[2798.84 --> 2800.30]  The Austin and Luke show has just begun.
[2800.40 --> 2800.72]  Welcome.
[2801.36 --> 2803.12]  Hopefully you're enjoying the camera talk.
[2803.40 --> 2804.18]  No more of that.
[2804.36 --> 2805.10]  No more cameras.
[2805.26 --> 2805.42]  Hi.
[2805.42 --> 2807.12]  Now we're going to talk about face-mounted displays.
[2807.22 --> 2807.74]  Face-mounted.
[2807.74 --> 2807.94]  I like that.
[2807.94 --> 2811.52]  Because I've seen the Oculus booth and most of the other VR booths.
[2811.54 --> 2811.70]  Right.
[2811.70 --> 2814.08]  And you've very specifically seen all the other VR booths.
[2814.08 --> 2814.88]  I've seen all the things.
[2814.88 --> 2815.30]  What's up, bros?
[2815.30 --> 2816.88]  Is your other one up?
[2816.94 --> 2817.48]  Is that video up?
[2817.68 --> 2819.16]  That video is not what we were shooting.
[2819.62 --> 2820.52]  Oh, a little bit of that.
[2820.60 --> 2821.18]  We shot today.
[2821.40 --> 2821.72]  Awkward.
[2822.32 --> 2824.26]  I'm sure, yeah, most of my stuff can go up later.
[2824.38 --> 2825.12]  But, yeah, I can talk about it.
[2825.16 --> 2827.08]  So, I tried a few different things.
[2827.46 --> 2828.94]  So, first of all, Gear VR.
[2829.10 --> 2829.48]  Have you tried it?
[2829.66 --> 2830.10]  I have it.
[2830.28 --> 2830.62]  Gear VR?
[2830.86 --> 2831.14]  Definitely.
[2831.24 --> 2832.00]  I've tried it a few times.
[2832.16 --> 2832.32]  Okay.
[2832.52 --> 2834.10]  So, I hope you're with me.
[2834.10 --> 2834.68]  It's awesome.
[2834.86 --> 2835.36]  It is awesome.
[2835.68 --> 2835.86]  Cool.
[2835.94 --> 2837.32]  So, I played a game.
[2837.88 --> 2841.08]  If you guys don't know Samsung Gear VR, it's like just, you throw the Note 4.
[2841.14 --> 2842.92]  It's kind of like a housing for the Note 4.
[2843.04 --> 2843.16]  Yeah.
[2843.16 --> 2845.76]  A little bit like Google Cardboard, although it's quite a bit nicer.
[2845.94 --> 2846.74]  It's nicer, yeah, for sure.
[2846.76 --> 2848.84]  But the Note 4, I mean, it's got that 1440p screen.
[2849.10 --> 2852.80]  You know, Oculus was already using Note 3 screens in the DK2, right?
[2852.94 --> 2853.08]  Yeah.
[2853.48 --> 2855.54]  So, it actually, it makes sense.
[2855.56 --> 2856.82]  It's a really nice screen.
[2857.00 --> 2859.24]  It's a very good visual experience, if nothing else.
[2859.32 --> 2863.00]  And it is good in other ways as well, but its visual experience is definitely there.
[2863.00 --> 2863.08]  Awesome.
[2863.08 --> 2863.22]  Yeah.
[2863.46 --> 2867.48]  So, the demo I tried, do you know the one where it's, you're constantly flying forward
[2867.48 --> 2871.86]  and then you control, you're entirely controlling it by looking around and then you tap the
[2871.86 --> 2872.48]  side to shoot?
[2872.48 --> 2872.98]  You know what?
[2873.18 --> 2874.28]  I don't know if I've done that one.
[2874.48 --> 2875.28]  I've done quite a few demos.
[2875.28 --> 2878.90]  That one blew my mind because that one kind of showed one of the big advantages of the
[2878.90 --> 2880.32]  Gear VR over something like Oculus.
[2880.54 --> 2882.54]  It's completely untethered, right?
[2882.80 --> 2886.82]  So, I was able to like spin around because the entire controls are you looking.
[2887.12 --> 2887.22]  Yeah.
[2887.22 --> 2890.14]  So, I can spin my chair around and do everything and I wasn't tethered.
[2890.14 --> 2891.80]  So, it was like, I was just like this.
[2892.80 --> 2894.22]  Like, I looked completely insane.
[2894.44 --> 2895.06]  But that's awesome.
[2895.22 --> 2895.28]  Yes.
[2895.28 --> 2897.58]  That's exactly what you want from a virtual reality experience.
[2897.86 --> 2898.12]  Yes.
[2898.44 --> 2901.64]  Because in the real world, you might look insane, but in the game, it makes a ton of sense.
[2901.64 --> 2901.86]  Yeah.
[2902.12 --> 2905.72]  That was, I was literally, I took it off and I was like grinning for like five minutes
[2905.72 --> 2905.98]  straight.
[2905.98 --> 2906.10]  Yeah.
[2906.32 --> 2906.44]  Yeah.
[2906.44 --> 2910.14]  That felt exactly like it felt when I tried the very first Oculus.
[2910.36 --> 2910.60]  Yeah.
[2910.76 --> 2912.36]  With the Eve Valkyrie demo.
[2912.44 --> 2912.60]  Yeah.
[2912.60 --> 2913.60]  Or whatever it was called back then.
[2913.86 --> 2914.78]  Eve VR or whatever it was.
[2914.92 --> 2915.04]  Yeah.
[2915.12 --> 2916.86]  The original version, like I tried that.
[2916.92 --> 2918.12]  I was just like, this is the greatest thing ever.
[2918.12 --> 2919.88]  I pulled my phone and like, okay, I got to order one of these things.
[2920.10 --> 2920.34]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2920.36 --> 2923.88]  Gear VR was like that same experience of like, whoa, this is really, really awesome.
[2923.98 --> 2924.60]  And it was on a phone.
[2925.32 --> 2926.28]  Like, it looked awesome.
[2926.36 --> 2927.18]  It was on a phone.
[2927.72 --> 2928.98]  So, Gear VR.
[2929.38 --> 2930.78]  It's very, very impressive.
[2930.92 --> 2933.40]  And I like that you brought up the non-tethered experience.
[2933.62 --> 2933.80]  Yeah.
[2933.94 --> 2934.98]  Because that is a big deal.
[2934.98 --> 2939.10]  Hopefully stuff like wireless HDMI stops being kind of, sort of junk.
[2939.66 --> 2943.56]  Because, well, like in certain situations it's good, but not for virtual reality.
[2943.76 --> 2943.92]  Right.
[2943.92 --> 2944.58]  Because it's too slow for that.
[2944.94 --> 2946.50]  So, junk for that.
[2946.62 --> 2947.36]  I don't mean junk in general.
[2947.36 --> 2951.06]  I've heard Oculus, they've talked so much about trying to get every tiny like millisecond
[2951.06 --> 2952.22]  out of the latency.
[2952.90 --> 2954.66]  I don't think wireless is going to work well.
[2954.66 --> 2957.14]  Well, not for them, at least for a very long time.
[2957.18 --> 2961.22]  Although, looking at how good that Note 4 was running, I don't think we're that far off
[2961.22 --> 2963.22]  from having like an entirely untethered Oculus.
[2963.22 --> 2964.80]  Like, it's clearly possible.
[2964.80 --> 2968.00]  Yeah, I think you'll have troubles with like the big, crazy games.
[2968.12 --> 2974.04]  But then, I also think that games created as both experiences might become less and less
[2974.04 --> 2974.94]  of a thing over time.
[2975.14 --> 2975.34]  Yeah.
[2975.38 --> 2979.46]  Because people are starting to realize that when you build a game around a like keyboard
[2979.46 --> 2984.40]  and mouse or controller experience, those are actually much more similar than a VR experience.
[2984.40 --> 2988.38]  You can't really shoehorn a normal game and go, uh, throw Oculus on it.
[2988.42 --> 2989.68]  You really can't do that.
[2989.82 --> 2990.88]  It's working for now.
[2991.02 --> 2991.32]  Yes.
[2991.34 --> 2993.32]  But in the long run, it's working.
[2993.46 --> 2999.86]  I feel like, like, I haven't seen any like awesome experience on VR that was not already
[2999.86 --> 3000.74]  like designed for VR.
[3000.80 --> 3001.30]  I haven't seen it.
[3001.36 --> 3002.96]  Some of them are like, uh, throw it on.
[3003.06 --> 3004.80]  Like, a couple things work reasonably well.
[3004.80 --> 3008.86]  But like all the best demos I've tried on VR were completely made from the ground.
[3008.94 --> 3009.06]  Yep.
[3009.12 --> 3010.08]  And a lot of them are simple too.
[3010.32 --> 3012.98]  Like this, I was literally just flying around shooting ships.
[3013.06 --> 3016.16]  But just because I was in it and I was spinning around and it was...
[3016.16 --> 3016.56]  Built for you.
[3016.78 --> 3017.14]  Exactly.
[3017.28 --> 3018.48]  Like that, that, that's a big deal.
[3018.60 --> 3022.18]  So I think that's a huge part of the VR experience is not so much the hardware.
[3022.30 --> 3024.48]  I feel like hardware is almost at this point good enough.
[3024.54 --> 3026.60]  Like the 1440p screen, solid.
[3026.80 --> 3026.96]  Yeah.
[3026.96 --> 3030.26]  But that soft, the software really needs to, I feel like, catch up quite a bit more.
[3030.26 --> 3034.02]  Some, some things in terms of hardware are going to be interesting because, uh, and this
[3034.02 --> 3036.74]  ties in again to the needs to be built for it.
[3036.86 --> 3037.06]  Yes.
[3037.12 --> 3037.44]  Idea.
[3037.82 --> 3042.30]  Um, because if you can get really close up to things, texture resolution becomes a huge
[3042.30 --> 3042.62]  problem.
[3042.72 --> 3043.00]  Yes.
[3043.04 --> 3047.36]  Because if you're like this far away from something, the texture resolution on that item
[3047.36 --> 3049.92]  needs to be very high for it to not look terrible.
[3050.08 --> 3053.20]  Because the resolution on your screen can be great, but when you're too close to things,
[3053.26 --> 3054.20]  it can just ruin the experience.
[3054.20 --> 3059.00]  So things need to either be made in a way that like, say you're in a ship, the things
[3059.00 --> 3061.04]  in the ship have a really good texture resolution.
[3061.36 --> 3061.46]  Right.
[3061.46 --> 3064.48]  And then the objects outside of it, which won't get that close to you, could maybe tone it
[3064.48 --> 3065.02]  down a little bit.
[3065.22 --> 3068.76]  And that's where performance might become an issue because high texture resolutions can
[3068.76 --> 3069.18]  be a problem.
[3069.24 --> 3073.32]  I feel like VR is like an entirely like huge step beyond anything.
[3073.48 --> 3077.96]  Like, yo, sure you have like 1080p screen or 1440p screen, but like considering just how
[3077.96 --> 3078.70]  different it is.
[3078.76 --> 3081.24]  And plus you gotta keep in mind that you're running it for both eyes.
[3081.24 --> 3084.68]  You have to keep like a, what, 75 frames or something like that for Hot Wheels?
[3084.68 --> 3085.94]  It depends which one.
[3086.04 --> 3089.90]  I believe the new unit, the, what is it, Crescent Bay is a 90 hertz.
[3090.08 --> 3091.04]  No, is it 90 now?
[3091.06 --> 3095.12]  Of course you can run your game, it's slower than that, but it has the potential of running
[3095.12 --> 3095.72]  up to 90 hertz.
[3095.72 --> 3095.98]  Right.
[3096.20 --> 3096.38]  Yeah.
[3096.52 --> 3098.24]  So like, it's massive.
[3098.24 --> 3108.00]  I almost feel like VR might just kind of like push a lot of hardware to like step up the
[3108.00 --> 3108.24]  game.
[3108.34 --> 3110.40]  Like, you know, you're not just running a 1080p screen.
[3110.52 --> 3112.02]  Like this is an entirely different deal.
[3112.40 --> 3112.56]  Yeah.
[3112.64 --> 3118.28]  Honestly, right now, and it's not the same as when like, let's say 10 years ago, but
[3118.28 --> 3123.06]  right now most people entering the gaming scene can buy a pretty freaking affordable computer
[3123.06 --> 3124.92]  and be totally fine.
[3125.26 --> 3127.30]  No problems running high frame rates, all that kind of stuff.
[3127.58 --> 3133.00]  The second you jump to VR, if you want to run 1440p screen, 90 FPS.
[3133.72 --> 3134.86]  Imagine something like Crisis.
[3135.80 --> 3136.20]  Ridiculous.
[3136.60 --> 3137.38]  So hard.
[3137.38 --> 3138.54]  So that's going to be interesting.
[3139.24 --> 3144.96]  But then again, experiences that are designed and tailored to be on VR, where they know these
[3144.96 --> 3146.30]  performance issues are going to be a problem.
[3146.86 --> 3151.02]  If they can make something, and that's another cool thing about Gear VR too, it has its own
[3151.02 --> 3151.38]  store.
[3151.38 --> 3152.10]  Yes.
[3152.18 --> 3154.12]  So you're not going to be trying to do the PC experiences.
[3154.24 --> 3157.90]  You'll be doing stuff that's made for Gear VR, which is perfect and that makes a ton of
[3157.90 --> 3158.08]  sense.
[3158.14 --> 3160.66]  And people will be able to go in there with the knowledge of what they're building it
[3160.66 --> 3163.72]  for and be able to create things that make a lot more sense for Gear VR.
[3164.20 --> 3165.10]  Untethered experiences.
[3165.70 --> 3168.70]  Maybe don't make it so you can get super close to things.
[3169.02 --> 3173.02]  Make it more of like, and like super close to things, I mean literally in your face.
[3173.10 --> 3174.28]  You can get as close as you want.
[3174.34 --> 3177.86]  It's not like you're, you know, looking at it from a TV that's like five feet away.
[3177.86 --> 3178.10]  Yeah.
[3178.10 --> 3178.70]  You can like step as close.
[3178.70 --> 3182.66]  The second you get any amount of distance off, text resolution isn't nearly as important.
[3182.66 --> 3186.34]  It's when you're like, hmm, I want to see like this screw on this object.
[3186.48 --> 3187.46]  Because that's one of the first things I do.
[3187.46 --> 3191.10]  If I look at this mouse, I put it this close to my face, I can still see all the detail.
[3191.34 --> 3191.46]  Yeah.
[3191.46 --> 3191.62]  Right?
[3191.68 --> 3193.86]  But like if it's sitting on the table, I don't need that much detail.
[3193.96 --> 3196.30]  So you figure it's like, it's pretty crazy.
[3196.50 --> 3197.50]  Have you tried much VR stuff?
[3198.40 --> 3201.04]  Not a whole lot, but I did really like the Oculus demo.
[3201.04 --> 3205.00]  I don't do super well with like fully immersed VR.
[3205.00 --> 3205.52]  Yeah.
[3205.52 --> 3206.00]  Yeah.
[3206.00 --> 3208.08]  Like I get a little dizzy motion sick sometimes.
[3208.08 --> 3208.36]  Really?
[3208.68 --> 3210.68]  I really enjoyed the Oculus demo.
[3210.68 --> 3213.04]  That should get better for you over time.
[3213.14 --> 3213.24]  Yeah.
[3213.24 --> 3214.42]  Because experiences become a lot stronger.
[3214.42 --> 3215.24]  Did you check out the demo?
[3215.68 --> 3216.12]  Not.
[3216.56 --> 3216.80]  No.
[3217.16 --> 3218.38]  It was three hour line.
[3218.52 --> 3219.18]  Did you hear about it?
[3219.68 --> 3220.36]  I heard a little bit about it.
[3220.42 --> 3220.56]  No.
[3220.90 --> 3221.02]  Okay.
[3221.18 --> 3221.78]  It was interesting.
[3221.94 --> 3225.92]  They had, I think this was the first time, at least at a show that I've been at, that
[3225.92 --> 3226.74]  they've probably done it before.
[3226.74 --> 3228.04]  They have fully developed demos.
[3228.04 --> 3232.14]  Not even that, they've had fully developed demos before, but it was standing.
[3233.02 --> 3233.76]  Oh, right.
[3233.96 --> 3235.38]  It was a standing experience.
[3235.38 --> 3241.08]  So you stood on like this pad, which was kind of like, so that you knew where you'd be in
[3241.08 --> 3242.58]  frame of the motion capture camera.
[3242.86 --> 3245.86]  The motion capture camera is a lot wider frame, vertically and horizontally.
[3246.20 --> 3250.38]  And there's now IR tracking LEDs that can track you when you're sideways and when you're
[3250.38 --> 3251.76]  not facing the camera.
[3252.06 --> 3254.72]  So it's not an untethered experience.
[3255.72 --> 3255.92]  Right.
[3255.92 --> 3261.30]  But it's kind of in between because before it was a seated in front of the camera, this
[3261.30 --> 3262.52]  is what you have to do experience.
[3262.70 --> 3264.70]  Now you can stand up and you can move around a little bit more.
[3264.94 --> 3265.70]  You still have a cable.
[3266.08 --> 3266.24]  Yeah.
[3266.38 --> 3268.64]  There's still like a box that you have to stand in.
[3268.82 --> 3270.58]  Both of those things are not the same as Gear VR.
[3270.82 --> 3270.96]  Yeah.
[3271.06 --> 3271.18]  Right.
[3271.18 --> 3274.18]  But we saw some pretty crazy demos.
[3274.36 --> 3277.40]  There was one where there's like a dinosaur coming after you.
[3277.52 --> 3278.20]  That was pretty cool.
[3278.44 --> 3281.62]  We went through an Unreal Engine demo, which was sick.
[3282.10 --> 3283.24]  Brandon and I both did it.
[3283.28 --> 3286.98]  And both of us like naturally tried to dodge the bullet, which was nuts.
[3286.98 --> 3287.98]  Glass flying at me.
[3287.98 --> 3288.46]  And glass flying at me.
[3288.46 --> 3289.52]  And I'm like, oh geez.
[3289.58 --> 3289.78]  Wow.
[3290.36 --> 3290.64]  Legit.
[3290.72 --> 3296.36]  And I've used Development Kit 2 enough that I've basically gotten rid of those natural
[3296.36 --> 3296.80]  responses.
[3297.08 --> 3301.10]  But with the new one and standing and just being out of all those elements that I'm used
[3301.10 --> 3305.42]  to now, it's triggering me again to start moving, which is really cool because that
[3305.42 --> 3306.38]  immersiveness is huge.
[3306.58 --> 3310.10]  The only thing that kind of broke it for me, which will be a problem for Gear VR too,
[3310.18 --> 3314.80]  but not necessarily everything, and hopefully new controllers come up for this, is the second
[3314.80 --> 3317.34]  something got in my face, I wanted to go try to grab it.
[3317.40 --> 3317.54]  Yeah.
[3317.88 --> 3319.26]  And I put my hand up, my hands down there.
[3320.02 --> 3321.32]  It's immersion breaking.
[3323.20 --> 3327.50]  And we'll also need, this is again where maybe Gear VR won't be super in this direction
[3327.50 --> 3329.30]  because physics events will be really hard to do.
[3329.42 --> 3329.58]  Right.
[3329.74 --> 3331.86]  But games where you're shooting stuff or whatever, totally fine.
[3331.86 --> 3335.92]  But on desktop ones where they can put more processing power into the physics and stuff,
[3336.16 --> 3341.12]  if you're able to wear like a glove that is tracking your hand and has some amount of
[3341.12 --> 3344.38]  haptic feedback in it and grab things and move them.
[3344.86 --> 3349.48]  Like if you could do that superhero scene where you're running and everything else is in super
[3349.48 --> 3352.64]  slow motion and you're going in full speed and you can like grab things that are in the
[3352.64 --> 3354.98]  air and throw them at people and stuff, that could be so sick.
[3355.14 --> 3355.86]  Brandon was talking about that.
[3355.86 --> 3360.16]  We took a little bit of a look at something like that with Razer OS VR today.
[3360.28 --> 3360.44]  Yep.
[3360.44 --> 3365.36]  And I had, basically it was a leap motion right on the front of the headset.
[3366.06 --> 3370.12]  And the demo we tried was like you hold your hands out and you have like fireballs and
[3370.12 --> 3370.80]  you like throw them.
[3371.16 --> 3373.08]  And it was just tracking your hands, right?
[3373.10 --> 3375.96]  So you could like track your individual fingers, hold it up high.
[3376.36 --> 3379.62]  And you could just like throw it at like the ghosts that were flying around.
[3380.04 --> 3382.78]  I feel like that might be a decent kind of like middle ground.
[3383.00 --> 3383.14]  Yep.
[3383.18 --> 3384.40]  But the tracking at least.
[3384.40 --> 3385.14]  No, that actually totally makes sense.
[3385.30 --> 3387.50]  The tracking at least for me was a little spotty.
[3387.50 --> 3388.38]  It was pretty rough.
[3388.50 --> 3389.58]  It didn't work that often.
[3389.58 --> 3393.50]  Now there's problems with that with interference because we were in the hall.
[3393.92 --> 3394.10]  Yeah.
[3394.10 --> 3396.06]  But it's not going to fix the problem.
[3396.64 --> 3397.88]  That's like a stepping stone.
[3398.12 --> 3398.92]  Yes, for sure.
[3399.04 --> 3399.22]  Yeah.
[3399.22 --> 3403.98]  I also tried another leap motion implementation which was at Suan's Cortex.
[3404.14 --> 3405.98]  That was hot words.
[3406.40 --> 3406.54]  Really?
[3406.54 --> 3409.24]  It probably worked about like 10% of the time.
[3409.62 --> 3413.10]  But a lot of that again due to interference in the hall because they were in an area with
[3413.10 --> 3414.32]  a lot of robots and stuff.
[3414.50 --> 3414.70]  Right.
[3414.76 --> 3416.40]  So there's a lot of radio interference.
[3416.68 --> 3418.28]  I don't know how that messes with leap motion.
[3418.40 --> 3418.60]  Yeah.
[3418.66 --> 3418.80]  Yeah.
[3418.80 --> 3419.14]  I don't know.
[3419.22 --> 3419.90]  But they were telling me that was a problem.
[3419.90 --> 3424.30]  And yeah, there was some serious issues with hand tracking there.
[3424.42 --> 3426.78]  But then again at OSVR jumping back.
[3427.82 --> 3428.04]  Yeah.
[3428.70 --> 3430.16]  Very specific positioning.
[3430.34 --> 3430.62]  Yes.
[3430.70 --> 3431.76]  Which was a little frustrating.
[3431.88 --> 3434.66]  You were like constantly like it would lose track so you hold your hands up like okay I've
[3434.66 --> 3435.06]  got it.
[3435.30 --> 3435.90]  No, I lost it.
[3435.96 --> 3436.16]  Yeah.
[3436.28 --> 3436.42]  Yeah.
[3436.42 --> 3436.62]  Yeah.
[3436.80 --> 3438.60]  And that was frustrating.
[3438.70 --> 3442.14]  You can get the hand of it but get the hand of it.
[3442.54 --> 3443.38]  Sorry I had to.
[3444.40 --> 3448.50]  But those are the kind of things that we have to overcome especially when it comes to input
[3448.50 --> 3452.76]  because a game like that I didn't even really think about it at first but I was talking
[3452.76 --> 3455.36]  about manipulating objects being difficult in terms of processing power.
[3455.62 --> 3458.30]  But a game like that would totally work for something like Gear VR.
[3458.70 --> 3458.92]  Yeah.
[3459.06 --> 3461.28]  And if you could get better tracking.
[3461.92 --> 3465.40]  You know Gear VR has a note built in.
[3465.40 --> 3468.20]  I wonder if you could like somehow leverage like the rear facing camera or something.
[3468.30 --> 3470.30]  I know there's like a piece.
[3470.66 --> 3473.18]  Like I wonder if like moving forward like you can kind of work out.
[3473.82 --> 3474.10]  Exactly.
[3474.24 --> 3474.34]  Yeah.
[3474.36 --> 3477.70]  Because like you think if you're working with a phone right you have a lot of stuff.
[3477.76 --> 3480.98]  It's already using like sensors and whatnot but I wonder like you work cameras in.
[3481.26 --> 3482.06]  Oh that's a good idea.
[3482.16 --> 3484.74]  I feel like there's more that you can do if you're working with a phone.
[3484.90 --> 3487.52]  Like before this I had zero expectations of Gear VR.
[3487.64 --> 3489.12]  It's just some goofy thing that they made.
[3489.40 --> 3491.86]  I mean I liked Google Cardboard but it was decent.
[3492.04 --> 3493.26]  But it didn't blow my mind.
[3493.86 --> 3494.02]  Right.
[3494.02 --> 3499.54]  But Gear VR I'm actually I'm paying way more attention to like some kind of like fully you know built.
[3500.58 --> 3501.38]  I don't even fully integrated.
[3501.54 --> 3501.90]  Hey.
[3502.04 --> 3502.48]  Tag in.
[3502.56 --> 3503.10]  Hi Darren.
[3503.24 --> 3504.64]  I feel like there's more people behind this too.
[3504.84 --> 3505.22]  What's up bro?
[3506.16 --> 3506.58]  Hi guys.
[3506.74 --> 3507.14]  Go on.
[3507.34 --> 3508.30]  You can tag in if you want.
[3508.52 --> 3508.94]  Just let me know.
[3509.52 --> 3516.72]  But you know I'm actually way more excited about some kind of like fully like what integrated headset.
[3516.72 --> 3516.92]  Yeah.
[3517.00 --> 3517.16]  Yeah.
[3517.16 --> 3517.34]  Yeah.
[3517.34 --> 3517.56]  Yeah.
[3517.56 --> 3519.22]  And that would be really cool.
[3519.48 --> 3520.92]  I'm going to jump to Ceylon's Cortex.
[3521.04 --> 3522.24]  You didn't watch that right?
[3522.24 --> 3522.34]  I haven't tried that right.
[3522.42 --> 3522.64]  Okay.
[3522.64 --> 3526.34]  So the idea of it is there's a spatial scanner on the back of your head.
[3526.46 --> 3526.64]  Right.
[3526.80 --> 3528.34]  There's stereo cameras on the front.
[3528.78 --> 3533.46]  And then other than that it looks a lot like an Oculus or a Gear VR.
[3533.80 --> 3534.58]  It's untethered.
[3535.30 --> 3535.70]  Okay.
[3535.70 --> 3540.96]  So the idea is that the spatial scanner and the stereo cameras take in the environment
[3540.96 --> 3541.80]  that's in the room.
[3542.14 --> 3542.52]  Ah.
[3542.60 --> 3543.78]  And then recreate it through.
[3543.90 --> 3547.86]  So there's an almost direct pass through kind of style thing going on.
[3547.86 --> 3548.40]  I know what you're talking about.
[3548.40 --> 3548.56]  Yeah.
[3548.56 --> 3551.68]  Where I can like I was standing in the room with Brandon and some of the guys that were
[3551.68 --> 3555.04]  doing the demo with me and I could see Brandon and the guys through the cameras.
[3555.20 --> 3556.00]  Like it wasn't a recreation.
[3556.28 --> 3557.08]  It was through the cameras.
[3557.78 --> 3560.20]  And then there was a portal on one side of the room.
[3560.20 --> 3565.26]  So I walked from where I was and went through the portal and then the whole structure of
[3565.26 --> 3567.60]  the room, the walls, Brandon, everything was gone.
[3568.32 --> 3571.68]  And now I'm in this like dragon or it was a, what was it?
[3571.70 --> 3572.52]  A Hydra lair.
[3572.86 --> 3574.40]  And I had to fight this Hydra.
[3574.50 --> 3580.12]  And it was a funny idea because this was shield block and this was shooting spells.
[3580.18 --> 3580.50]  Yeah.
[3580.56 --> 3581.86]  And it was based on a leap motion.
[3582.04 --> 3584.86]  So when I went to OSVR I was like, this is oddly familiar.
[3585.16 --> 3585.50]  Yeah.
[3585.66 --> 3585.94]  Yeah.
[3585.94 --> 3590.68]  But yeah, the problem with that was huge issues with hand tracking.
[3591.00 --> 3592.84]  The screen was not ready.
[3592.96 --> 3595.22]  Like I know you were not stoked on the OSVR screen.
[3595.34 --> 3598.66]  I wasn't either, but the C-Lens Cortex was worse.
[3599.66 --> 3601.78]  Now this isn't the final version.
[3602.16 --> 3602.58]  Of course.
[3602.82 --> 3605.32]  So they're going to be, they're going to be replacing the leap motion.
[3605.80 --> 3608.06]  So hopefully the problems with tracking will be gone.
[3608.42 --> 3610.24]  They're going to be updating stuff like the screen.
[3610.58 --> 3612.06]  So hopefully they'll solve those issues.
[3612.06 --> 3613.64]  Like it's, it's very early on.
[3613.64 --> 3616.84]  They didn't even let me film in the area that I was able to do the demo.
[3617.28 --> 3621.20]  Because they didn't want you to see the unit that they had that had like some wires going
[3621.20 --> 3622.02]  all over the place and stuff.
[3622.76 --> 3626.44]  Which I thought is kind of silly because Oculus is like, look at every single version of everything
[3626.44 --> 3627.90]  we've ever made that looks like trash.
[3628.30 --> 3630.44]  Which like everyone I know thinks is cool.
[3630.72 --> 3631.22]  Yeah, same.
[3631.22 --> 3637.22]  And then they didn't let us film like an external screen for what the demo I was going through was either.
[3637.56 --> 3637.82]  Right.
[3637.94 --> 3638.98]  So I wasn't able to show that.
[3638.98 --> 3639.82]  I mean I can understand.
[3639.98 --> 3642.22]  Like you're working on something that's a prototype and it's not done yet.
[3642.24 --> 3643.22]  You don't want someone to make a video.
[3643.34 --> 3644.66]  Like look how much this thing sucks.
[3644.78 --> 3645.36]  You're like when it's not done.
[3645.52 --> 3647.02]  Yeah, but now I'm talking here about how I had trouble.
[3647.02 --> 3647.74]  But now you're talking about it.
[3647.78 --> 3649.10]  Everyone's assuming it's way worse.
[3649.76 --> 3650.36]  Yeah, right.
[3650.40 --> 3651.84]  Like if you could just see the experience.
[3651.90 --> 3654.54]  Because it wasn't, it was a good proof of concept.
[3654.74 --> 3654.96]  Right.
[3654.96 --> 3657.44]  I don't think it's ready and it's obviously not.
[3657.52 --> 3658.22]  It's not released yet.
[3658.56 --> 3661.38]  But I don't know if even their release will be ready.
[3661.50 --> 3665.00]  Because I know they're planning on, they're trying to get Taryn to poke one of us.
[3666.06 --> 3666.56]  I think you guys.
[3666.56 --> 3668.22]  The Twitch chat is, they do that.
[3668.22 --> 3668.36]  I have to do it.
[3668.40 --> 3668.72]  I'm sorry.
[3669.48 --> 3669.84]  Austin.
[3670.30 --> 3672.96]  Yeah, they have development kit releasing in however many months.
[3673.20 --> 3675.92]  And that is, as far as I know, the only development kit they're going to release.
[3676.22 --> 3679.52]  And then CV, they don't have a release date.
[3679.58 --> 3682.54]  But as far as I can tell, they're getting close to what they want the final version to be.
[3682.54 --> 3685.04]  And it's not ready, in my opinion.
[3685.22 --> 3693.54]  But this idea of spatial scanners, stereo cameras, and being able to interact with environments that are very similar to the room that you're in are interesting.
[3694.40 --> 3699.26]  The other demo that I had from them was, so same kind of like rectangular room.
[3699.54 --> 3700.70]  There's an engine in the middle.
[3701.30 --> 3703.04]  And I remapped the room so I could see the wall.
[3703.14 --> 3704.56]  So I could walk up to the wall and touch it.
[3704.90 --> 3705.78]  And the wall was actually there.
[3705.78 --> 3708.28]  So you're talking about the actual like physical wall that you were.
[3708.36 --> 3709.36]  The physical wall, yes.
[3709.36 --> 3710.26]  So you're walking around in this demo.
[3710.48 --> 3710.64]  Yeah.
[3710.82 --> 3711.06]  Okay.
[3711.06 --> 3715.22]  So I could walk up to the physical wall and it was recreated in the headset.
[3715.76 --> 3716.92]  So I could walk up to it and touch it.
[3716.98 --> 3719.28]  Now this was virtual, so it was like a glowing wall.
[3719.58 --> 3722.40]  But when I touched it, I actually touched the actual real wall.
[3722.74 --> 3724.10]  Which is kind of a cool experience.
[3724.16 --> 3724.56]  That's cool.
[3724.56 --> 3725.34]  To be completely honest.
[3725.42 --> 3726.28]  Wait, you could touch the wall?
[3727.22 --> 3727.42]  Yeah.
[3727.56 --> 3730.12]  It was a demo that I could walk around in.
[3730.26 --> 3731.48]  So it was a big rectangular room.
[3731.66 --> 3732.56]  And I could walk around in it.
[3732.60 --> 3735.24]  And the headset has stereo cameras on the front and a spatial scanner.
[3735.24 --> 3737.76]  So it recreated the room in the virtual reality headset.
[3738.02 --> 3740.12]  And then you can go around and like touch the walls and whatnot.
[3740.52 --> 3741.00]  That's amazing.
[3741.10 --> 3745.58]  And then I touched the engine seductively.
[3745.58 --> 3748.30]  Is it time that we all like start lounging?
[3749.08 --> 3750.24]  Is that part of the Wayne show?
[3750.46 --> 3753.34]  But if I lounge back, then you'll be touching my penis.
[3753.34 --> 3755.18]  Yeah, it's going to get a little bit personal.
[3755.42 --> 3756.66]  I'll go a little bit lounge back.
[3756.66 --> 3759.00]  It can virtual reality have to be someone else.
[3759.20 --> 3760.46]  Yeah, there we go.
[3760.98 --> 3762.26]  Bring it around.
[3763.02 --> 3766.48]  To keep going on my more boring story, there's an engine in the middle of the room floating.
[3766.76 --> 3768.90]  And you can go up to it and look at it and all that kind of stuff.
[3769.22 --> 3774.76]  And then if you hold your hands in front of you and go like that, the engine will explode.
[3774.88 --> 3775.40]  Isn't the right word.
[3775.50 --> 3777.68]  But like all the individual pieces will come out.
[3778.02 --> 3782.06]  And you'll be able to see like all the different screws and each individual piston and all that kind of stuff.
[3782.06 --> 3786.44]  And then if you put your hands up again and pull in, the engine will reassemble itself.
[3786.68 --> 3788.62]  So I can't take you seriously with him right behind me.
[3789.00 --> 3792.06]  I'm so used to him screwing around that it almost doesn't bother me.
[3792.08 --> 3793.40]  You're immune to this right now?
[3793.42 --> 3794.16]  Yeah, I'm just like, whatever.
[3794.42 --> 3795.38]  It's just happening.
[3795.98 --> 3796.88]  This is a thing.
[3796.88 --> 3797.76]  This is daily normal.
[3797.78 --> 3801.16]  That's exactly the line that I've been waiting to hear all my life.
[3805.68 --> 3806.72]  The wind show!
[3807.50 --> 3808.08]  Oh, no.
[3808.62 --> 3808.88]  Okay.
[3809.46 --> 3810.02]  All right.
[3810.10 --> 3810.34]  Okay.
[3810.74 --> 3811.14]  All right.
[3811.14 --> 3812.36]  So now that you're here.
[3813.24 --> 3813.64]  Hi.
[3813.84 --> 3814.08]  Hi.
[3814.12 --> 3815.84]  First of all, I feel like I just took over.
[3816.60 --> 3817.00]  Welcome.
[3817.66 --> 3819.66]  This is a little show called The Wind Show.
[3819.78 --> 3819.98]  Uh-huh.
[3820.04 --> 3820.26]  Yes.
[3820.28 --> 3821.16]  Glad to have you on.
[3821.26 --> 3821.46]  Uh-huh.
[3821.56 --> 3821.74]  Yes.
[3822.04 --> 3824.62]  It's basically we talk about The Hobbit.
[3825.06 --> 3827.04]  People love talking about cameras.
[3827.28 --> 3828.02]  Best part.
[3828.24 --> 3828.42]  Yeah.
[3828.62 --> 3830.72]  We talk about VR way too much.
[3830.86 --> 3831.04]  Yeah.
[3831.26 --> 3833.90]  And that's pretty much it.
[3833.96 --> 3834.48]  So welcome.
[3834.94 --> 3835.36]  Officially.
[3836.22 --> 3836.92]  How's your day going?
[3837.12 --> 3840.82]  Well, I was thinking maybe we should actually look at that hashtag that we told everyone to use.
[3840.82 --> 3843.24]  Hashtag Austin's nipple.
[3843.54 --> 3845.60]  Wait, is it Austin nipples?
[3846.02 --> 3847.64]  Austin S nipple.
[3847.96 --> 3848.28]  Singular.
[3848.28 --> 3848.44]  Okay.
[3848.56 --> 3849.66]  Austin's nipple.
[3849.84 --> 3850.14]  Austin's nipple.
[3850.14 --> 3850.96]  So I have one nipple.
[3851.84 --> 3852.30]  All right.
[3852.84 --> 3853.44]  Um.
[3854.92 --> 3855.36]  Okay.
[3855.36 --> 3857.84]  What about the porn set?
[3858.42 --> 3858.70]  Oh.
[3858.70 --> 3859.10]  Okay.
[3859.86 --> 3860.86]  I don't know if we have time for that one.
[3861.10 --> 3862.62]  Well, we'll just turn the camera around.
[3863.50 --> 3866.14]  Andrew says, this is seriously the coolest WAN show.
[3866.24 --> 3868.52]  I love this community gathering of YouTubers.
[3869.00 --> 3869.50]  This is fun.
[3870.18 --> 3872.08]  This is literally like there just happens to be a camera rolling.
[3872.08 --> 3872.44]  Yeah.
[3872.56 --> 3873.60]  How did that get there?
[3873.60 --> 3877.62]  Did they even notice that TLD today and your average consumer are back there?
[3877.88 --> 3878.00]  Yeah.
[3878.06 --> 3878.34]  You guys.
[3878.42 --> 3878.62]  Come on.
[3878.68 --> 3878.92]  Come on.
[3879.28 --> 3879.88]  Come on up.
[3881.08 --> 3882.94]  Tag yourselves in, my friends.
[3884.24 --> 3884.74]  There you go.
[3884.86 --> 3885.72]  I just want to.
[3885.88 --> 3887.50]  Welcome to hashtag Austin's nipple.
[3887.74 --> 3891.20]  I wanted to point something out, which is that we're not supposed to be using a pool table.
[3891.92 --> 3893.18]  You've got to point that out.
[3893.30 --> 3894.16]  That's how it's going to be.
[3894.40 --> 3894.80]  Corsair.
[3894.80 --> 3895.52]  Corsair staff only.
[3895.74 --> 3895.86]  Corsair.
[3895.86 --> 3896.24]  Oops.
[3896.24 --> 3897.30]  Apparently I need to.
[3897.76 --> 3898.50]  I am getting.
[3898.50 --> 3900.02]  I'm getting booted.
[3900.20 --> 3901.12]  Booted from the show.
[3901.60 --> 3902.10]  What's going on?
[3902.22 --> 3902.42]  Wait.
[3902.82 --> 3903.34]  You guys.
[3903.34 --> 3903.90]  You guys can take over.
[3904.28 --> 3904.90]  Take over.
[3904.98 --> 3905.68]  Take over the show.
[3905.70 --> 3906.06]  Step in.
[3906.14 --> 3906.96]  We can't take over.
[3907.46 --> 3908.32]  Yes, you can.
[3908.44 --> 3909.56]  Linus, you've got to join us.
[3911.32 --> 3912.78]  I can't do this all myself.
[3912.86 --> 3913.46]  You've got this, man.
[3913.52 --> 3913.98]  You've got this.
[3913.98 --> 3914.64]  I'll see you, Terry.
[3914.90 --> 3915.46]  Okay, okay.
[3915.94 --> 3917.18]  How about I talk about the video?
[3917.32 --> 3918.02]  I made it.
[3918.16 --> 3918.48]  I made it.
[3918.48 --> 3919.38]  Everyone's going to look at my crotch.
[3919.38 --> 3919.74]  It's cool.
[3919.74 --> 3921.18]  This is Taren Tech Tips now.
[3921.44 --> 3922.50]  I have the alliteration.
[3923.32 --> 3925.06]  What have you seen at the show that you like?
[3925.06 --> 3927.06]  Okay, I will tell you, Luke.
[3927.48 --> 3927.74]  Alright.
[3928.50 --> 3932.90]  So the coolest thing that I saw was, um, did you swing by the intel area?
[3933.12 --> 3934.10]  I was barely there.
[3934.24 --> 3934.48]  Okay.
[3934.62 --> 3936.32]  I was there for, like, only with you today.
[3936.44 --> 3940.24]  So we were passing through there, and I saw this guy with a robot hand.
[3940.58 --> 3940.78]  Yeah.
[3940.84 --> 3943.52]  That was 3D printed, and I was just staring at it.
[3943.52 --> 3943.96]  I was like, what?
[3944.14 --> 3945.42]  Does he have, like, a real hand under there?
[3945.52 --> 3946.20]  Is this fake?
[3946.50 --> 3948.16]  But he did not have a right hand.
[3948.34 --> 3948.58]  Right.
[3948.58 --> 3950.68]  So he had, like, I don't know, he was born without a hand.
[3950.68 --> 3951.30]  What happened?
[3951.42 --> 3955.68]  Um, and, and it was, like, up to, up to here, or, or, or here is when it stopped.
[3955.72 --> 3956.48]  I couldn't tell because.
[3956.58 --> 3958.48]  So, like, fairly far down his forearm.
[3958.68 --> 3963.38]  But they used an intel scanning thing to scan what Army had.
[3963.58 --> 3963.72]  Yeah.
[3963.72 --> 3968.32]  And they made a 3D printed mold from that, um, to go on the rest of it.
[3968.38 --> 3970.66]  And then they had the regular, I guess, the stock kind of hand.
[3970.86 --> 3971.04]  Right.
[3971.28 --> 3975.00]  Which was connected to, I, I suppose there were motors.
[3975.18 --> 3978.82]  I think it was, uh, done by wire or something.
[3978.94 --> 3979.04]  Okay.
[3979.04 --> 3980.14]  Like, just how a tendon works.
[3980.16 --> 3980.80]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3980.80 --> 3982.96]  And then he was wearing something on his hip as well.
[3983.26 --> 3983.44]  Yeah.
[3983.56 --> 3988.18]  And there were all these sensors all over his actual arm because he was mind controlling
[3988.18 --> 3989.38]  this 3D printed robot hand.
[3989.38 --> 3990.42]  Mind control.
[3990.64 --> 3992.44]  And it was just the coolest thing.
[3992.44 --> 3994.54]  And he was shaking people's hands and I shook his hand.
[3994.82 --> 3995.02]  Yeah.
[3995.20 --> 3996.56]  And then you said there was a wrist.
[3996.56 --> 3996.58]  Yeah.
[3996.58 --> 3998.46]  So, so, if you don't move your, no, no, no.
[3998.58 --> 3999.88]  No wrist action at all.
[4000.08 --> 4003.90]  It's a little awkward trying to shake with no wrist action.
[4003.92 --> 4003.94]  Oh, yeah.
[4003.94 --> 4004.62]  That's kind of weird.
[4004.70 --> 4004.90]  Yeah.
[4005.34 --> 4005.58]  So.
[4005.70 --> 4006.00]  Interesting.
[4006.04 --> 4007.12]  But it was still amazing.
[4007.32 --> 4008.52]  It was still the coolest thing ever.
[4008.60 --> 4009.60]  He could do the fist bump.
[4010.14 --> 4010.34]  Yeah.
[4010.34 --> 4011.40]  And then he could explode.
[4011.54 --> 4011.70]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4011.70 --> 4012.46]  He could explode the fist out.
[4012.60 --> 4012.76]  Yeah.
[4012.84 --> 4013.52]  It was amazing.
[4014.18 --> 4015.00]  That's really cool.
[4015.00 --> 4022.28]  So, I didn't, I didn't know that it was possible to have mind control of a hand.
[4022.28 --> 4022.58]  Yeah, yeah.
[4022.58 --> 4027.24]  I know because I've seen the guy that has like two new arms or whatever.
[4027.34 --> 4028.30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4028.30 --> 4028.76]  I saw that one.
[4028.80 --> 4030.96]  But they had to like go into his chest or his brain.
[4031.12 --> 4032.00]  Like it was really painful.
[4032.04 --> 4032.76]  I think it was both.
[4032.96 --> 4033.58]  I'm not even sure.
[4033.72 --> 4034.90]  I didn't look enough into it.
[4035.16 --> 4035.28]  Yeah.
[4035.28 --> 4036.66]  But on the topic.
[4036.66 --> 4038.08]  And he could only move one thing at a time.
[4038.68 --> 4038.94]  Yeah.
[4039.16 --> 4039.36]  Yeah.
[4039.46 --> 4039.62]  Yeah.
[4039.74 --> 4041.02]  But he could control both arms.
[4041.02 --> 4041.28]  Right.
[4041.28 --> 4046.40]  On the topic of like assistance of the potentially disabled.
[4046.94 --> 4049.98]  One thing that I saw at, what is it even called?
[4050.10 --> 4050.70]  Showstoppers.
[4051.74 --> 4055.52]  So like kind of CES, like the attachment thing in CES.
[4055.66 --> 4056.28]  It's not actually the CES.
[4056.28 --> 4057.18]  Yeah, I didn't see that one.
[4057.40 --> 4059.92]  Yeah, it was just Brandon and I actually.
[4060.84 --> 4065.72]  But it was a like external exoskeleton kind of thing.
[4066.08 --> 4067.50]  I'm not thinking of the right word.
[4067.52 --> 4067.98]  Oh, is that?
[4068.32 --> 4070.66]  Well, is that the right word?
[4071.04 --> 4071.86]  What did it do?
[4073.32 --> 4074.58]  I feel like I'm doing the wrong one.
[4074.62 --> 4077.72]  But like you strap it to your legs and your arms and stuff.
[4077.84 --> 4078.86]  And then it assists movement.
[4079.02 --> 4079.20]  Yeah.
[4079.62 --> 4079.90]  Yeah.
[4080.20 --> 4080.82]  Okay, yeah.
[4081.02 --> 4082.84]  For some reason, I think there's a different word for it.
[4082.86 --> 4085.34]  Well, there's a word for it that's not exoskeleton.
[4085.44 --> 4085.70]  Yeah.
[4085.82 --> 4087.36]  But I know what you're talking about.
[4087.54 --> 4087.72]  Yeah.
[4087.72 --> 4089.82]  So is this for workers or for disabled people?
[4089.82 --> 4093.72]  This is for people that don't have proper movement in their legs.
[4093.84 --> 4096.68]  I have a cousin who has that problem.
[4096.76 --> 4096.86]  Okay.
[4097.32 --> 4098.62]  And she has one of these.
[4098.74 --> 4099.62]  That won't distract me.
[4099.70 --> 4100.14]  Oh, does she?
[4100.18 --> 4100.32]  Yeah.
[4100.58 --> 4101.24]  It's 3D printed.
[4101.70 --> 4102.08]  Interesting.
[4102.42 --> 4106.76]  So the person that they had there was a disabled veteran.
[4107.24 --> 4112.24]  And he was able to walk around with completely disabled legs on his feet.
[4112.52 --> 4114.50]  He had to support himself a little bit with scratches.
[4115.18 --> 4117.22]  His legs were completely disabled and he could walk.
[4117.22 --> 4118.54]  Legs were completely disabled and he could walk.
[4118.58 --> 4119.44]  That doesn't make sense to me.
[4119.44 --> 4121.64]  He had no muscle control or just a little bit?
[4121.70 --> 4122.94]  I don't think he had any.
[4123.16 --> 4125.70]  Because how can you walk if you have no control at all over your legs?
[4125.70 --> 4128.20]  Because the, I think, what was it?
[4128.40 --> 4130.44]  Through like, I think hip motion?
[4130.70 --> 4131.04]  Really?
[4131.16 --> 4132.96]  You would trigger the machine to move forward.
[4132.96 --> 4133.38]  Oh, okay.
[4133.44 --> 4134.50]  So it's motorized.
[4134.64 --> 4134.88]  Yes.
[4135.00 --> 4135.44]  No, definitely.
[4135.54 --> 4136.36]  That's the whole idea.
[4136.36 --> 4136.78]  Yeah.
[4136.78 --> 4136.80]  Okay.
[4136.80 --> 4139.38]  Because the one that my little cousin has, I think it's rubber bands.
[4139.38 --> 4141.84]  And you just, you put bands on.
[4141.88 --> 4143.40]  Because she's missing a lot of muscles.
[4143.78 --> 4143.98]  Right.
[4144.10 --> 4144.22]  Right.
[4144.30 --> 4145.52]  So they're like replacing.
[4145.52 --> 4146.26]  Yeah, exactly.
[4146.26 --> 4146.52]  Yeah.
[4146.80 --> 4148.90]  No, this was, he was in a wheelchair most definitely.
[4149.50 --> 4151.34]  And they had to help him strap in.
[4151.42 --> 4151.64]  Wow.
[4151.64 --> 4153.42]  And like lift his legs and strap the leg in.
[4153.42 --> 4154.08]  Yeah, that's cool stuff.
[4154.08 --> 4155.22]  But then he could stand up.
[4155.28 --> 4159.68]  He had to use crutches because I believe, I was thinking about doing a video on it.
[4159.72 --> 4162.64]  But then I was just so far out of my league on this one that I didn't think it was a good idea.
[4163.70 --> 4167.04]  He was able to use crutches because he would lean forward.
[4167.14 --> 4169.34]  It was kind of like a segue but with legs.
[4170.14 --> 4174.54]  So if he leaned forward and put a little bit of weight on his crutches, his legs would start moving.
[4175.18 --> 4175.34]  Right.
[4175.34 --> 4178.48]  And then if he stopped leaning forward and stood up, the legs would stop moving.
[4178.48 --> 4178.52]  Oh, that's cool.
[4178.72 --> 4180.38]  It's a, it's a bipedal segue.
[4180.70 --> 4181.78]  Yeah, kind of.
[4181.84 --> 4183.20]  And I'm like, man, this is super cool.
[4183.20 --> 4186.50]  But I like can't explain how it works or anything.
[4186.50 --> 4187.44]  Did we get video of it?
[4187.98 --> 4188.18]  No.
[4188.58 --> 4188.86]  Okay.
[4188.98 --> 4196.52]  Speaking of, speaking of people being able to roll around, did you guys see the virtual presence booth today?
[4197.02 --> 4198.50]  I saw it.
[4198.58 --> 4199.50]  I can't remember.
[4199.68 --> 4200.46]  You walked past it.
[4200.56 --> 4201.86]  Yeah, I can't remember who it was.
[4201.96 --> 4207.56]  But they had this crazy demo of like a, like a sports mascot type character.
[4207.80 --> 4211.30]  And then they had like a gigantic virtual presence device.
[4211.32 --> 4212.32]  Oh, that was so dumb.
[4212.32 --> 4213.58]  Yeah, no, I saw that.
[4213.78 --> 4218.06]  That like basically what looks like crowd control from like dystopian future device.
[4218.24 --> 4218.46]  Yeah.
[4218.52 --> 4218.86]  Yeah.
[4219.30 --> 4223.44]  There were different sizes and there was the one massive one.
[4223.52 --> 4224.46]  It was like two stories tall or something.
[4224.46 --> 4224.68]  Yeah.
[4224.68 --> 4224.94]  Yeah.
[4224.94 --> 4224.98]  Yeah.
[4225.06 --> 4228.84]  So when we stopped by, that one was singing the Hokey Pokey.
[4229.26 --> 4233.18]  And they had like 10 smaller ones.
[4233.18 --> 4233.36]  Yeah.
[4233.48 --> 4236.16]  And they were doing that, putting their butt in and butt out.
[4236.30 --> 4237.84]  And I don't, they don't have arms or legs.
[4238.10 --> 4238.20]  So they used to turn around.
[4238.20 --> 4240.86]  That giant one though was like legitimately like.
[4240.86 --> 4242.56]  That was, I was, it's, yeah.
[4242.62 --> 4243.58]  It inspires fear.
[4243.72 --> 4243.90]  Yeah.
[4243.94 --> 4244.32]  That's what it is.
[4244.32 --> 4246.16]  And it's hooked up to the speaker system, right?
[4246.28 --> 4247.06]  So it's like.
[4247.06 --> 4251.76]  And you do the Hokey Pokey and you turn yourself around.
[4251.90 --> 4253.30]  You better do the Hokey Pokey.
[4253.40 --> 4253.98]  Oh no.
[4254.36 --> 4254.62]  I'm sorry.
[4254.78 --> 4255.90]  I just figured for 30 seconds.
[4256.08 --> 4256.24]  What?
[4256.36 --> 4257.14]  Hokey Pokey time?
[4257.80 --> 4259.64]  There was a giant robot.
[4259.64 --> 4260.64]  Giant, uh.
[4260.64 --> 4261.98]  Giant two story robot.
[4262.12 --> 4262.28]  Yeah.
[4262.36 --> 4262.98]  I was going to show you two.
[4262.98 --> 4263.20]  Yeah.
[4263.20 --> 4263.40]  Yeah.
[4263.40 --> 4263.52]  Yeah.
[4263.52 --> 4263.88]  Exactly.
[4264.06 --> 4264.94]  We're just talking about that.
[4265.10 --> 4266.84]  It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.
[4266.94 --> 4267.74]  It's so creepy.
[4267.74 --> 4270.02]  That tops my like all time CES list.
[4270.10 --> 4272.24]  Like their, their booth was creepy enough.
[4272.40 --> 4277.52]  Cause we were just, we were just standing in it and they just had people remotely chucking
[4277.52 --> 4278.22]  around in the booth.
[4278.30 --> 4279.88]  The most awkward conversations ever.
[4279.96 --> 4282.46]  So these people just walk up to you and you just like.
[4283.68 --> 4284.08]  Hi.
[4284.66 --> 4285.06]  Hi.
[4285.48 --> 4285.80]  Yeah.
[4287.80 --> 4289.58]  And then there's the big scary one that can crush you.
[4290.00 --> 4292.72]  Dude, seriously, I think it had to be at least 30 feet tall.
[4292.96 --> 4296.04]  But it seemed to put like, uh, like flamethrowers on it.
[4296.14 --> 4296.84]  And then there you go.
[4296.88 --> 4297.06]  Yup.
[4297.14 --> 4297.62]  Crowd control.
[4297.86 --> 4298.44]  We're done.
[4298.74 --> 4299.02]  We're done.
[4299.32 --> 4300.40]  And it just, yeah, definitely.
[4301.32 --> 4301.76]  Oh, but.
[4301.88 --> 4302.12]  Screwed.
[4302.26 --> 4303.10]  Robot overlords.
[4303.68 --> 4304.52]  Robot overlords.
[4304.60 --> 4304.72]  Yeah.
[4305.00 --> 4305.16]  Yeah.
[4305.24 --> 4307.10]  So that's, that was your favorite thing was the hand thing?
[4307.12 --> 4307.64]  That was the hand.
[4307.94 --> 4308.18]  Yeah.
[4308.36 --> 4308.54]  Yeah.
[4308.54 --> 4308.82]  For sure.
[4309.04 --> 4310.76]  That was, I just saw it and I'm like, ooh.
[4311.06 --> 4315.70]  I think my two favorite things, obviously I'm going to say, I picked two instead of one just because
[4315.70 --> 4319.62]  everyone knows it's going to be whatever badass virtual reality.
[4319.64 --> 4323.90]  So this year, for me, it was Crescent Bay.
[4324.90 --> 4327.84]  I was, I was, honestly, I was more excited for Suelance.
[4328.20 --> 4332.00]  But Suelance wasn't ready enough for it to be a better Crescent Bay.
[4332.00 --> 4332.22]  I don't know what Suelance is.
[4332.42 --> 4336.08]  Suelance was that, that one that has the spatial scanner and the two stereo cameras.
[4336.18 --> 4337.92]  I was telling you, it recreates the room and there's the hand.
[4337.92 --> 4338.30]  Oh, okay.
[4338.44 --> 4338.58]  Yeah.
[4338.72 --> 4338.82]  Yeah.
[4338.88 --> 4339.00]  Yeah.
[4339.00 --> 4341.90]  But yeah, no, it was Crescent Bay.
[4342.18 --> 4346.28]  And then other than that, that Origin laptop with the full desktop processor.
[4346.72 --> 4347.92]  Well, that's been done before.
[4348.04 --> 4348.30]  I know.
[4348.72 --> 4349.64]  Was it a lot thinner though?
[4349.84 --> 4350.62]  It was a lot thinner.
[4350.76 --> 4351.62]  Because I haven't seen the video.
[4351.62 --> 4356.52]  It seemed more, like, it was very similar to this one in terms of size.
[4356.68 --> 4362.46]  So it seemed like, I'd probably say that it was a little bit smaller than our Jay-Z's.
[4363.22 --> 4363.44]  Right.
[4363.62 --> 4364.88]  Not much, but a little bit.
[4365.60 --> 4367.20]  Now, one thing is it screams.
[4368.80 --> 4369.20]  Right.
[4369.20 --> 4370.50]  To keep the processor cool.
[4370.50 --> 4374.02]  So once you ramp up, it'll just start going nuts.
[4375.16 --> 4376.02]  Like, absolutely nuts.
[4376.44 --> 4376.76]  What's up?
[4377.14 --> 4378.72]  They're complaining about the background noise again.
[4378.98 --> 4380.96]  We're getting complaints about background noise again.
[4381.00 --> 4381.28]  Yeah.
[4381.60 --> 4382.30]  I can't hear you.
[4382.30 --> 4382.74]  Jerks.
[4384.44 --> 4386.34]  We don't have a proper mic.
[4386.34 --> 4388.22]  Actually, we've only got about 10 minutes left.
[4388.22 --> 4392.64]  So if there's anyone who wants to jump in, anyone who hasn't been on yet, say, for example,
[4393.12 --> 4394.18]  now's a good time.
[4395.00 --> 4398.18]  Yeah, and maybe hang out somewhere else.
[4398.22 --> 4399.10]  What did you have in here?
[4399.10 --> 4402.22]  Oh, is he going to come?
[4402.50 --> 4404.14]  Oh, are you going to talk about this?
[4405.16 --> 4405.56]  All right.
[4405.98 --> 4406.44]  All right.
[4406.66 --> 4407.52]  We got a tag.
[4407.92 --> 4408.12]  Oh, yeah.
[4408.26 --> 4408.46]  Yeah.
[4408.66 --> 4409.96]  I almost, like, shook your hand.
[4409.96 --> 4410.10]  No.
[4410.54 --> 4411.82]  Is that it?
[4411.82 --> 4412.28]  Is that a tag?
[4412.28 --> 4412.66]  I don't know.
[4413.56 --> 4415.66]  I think you can just tap a guy on the shoulder, realistically.
[4415.84 --> 4416.86]  I think we went a little bit too much.
[4416.92 --> 4417.32]  All right.
[4417.48 --> 4418.00]  What's up here?
[4418.08 --> 4419.64]  So, okay, so over here, we're a little bit behind.
[4419.64 --> 4420.52]  This is the stream.
[4420.62 --> 4421.68]  This is what I need to know about.
[4421.68 --> 4422.48]  This is, like, if you're on a...
[4422.48 --> 4423.30]  Yeah, watch that one.
[4423.40 --> 4425.26]  And so the camera's, like, way over there.
[4425.42 --> 4426.60]  I can't believe I let you touch it.
[4426.70 --> 4428.10]  No, they didn't let me.
[4428.10 --> 4429.10]  They have no...
[4429.10 --> 4431.76]  Well, at first, they had no idea this was going to end up in my hands.
[4432.38 --> 4434.18]  It was John, right?
[4434.30 --> 4435.56]  He went on a reconnaissance mission.
[4435.60 --> 4436.18]  Good work, John.
[4436.52 --> 4439.54]  And, you know, he's a bit of a smooth talker.
[4440.24 --> 4443.34]  And so he went in there and walked out with this baby.
[4443.46 --> 4448.88]  But immediately after, they started to panic because they knew where this was going to end up.
[4449.34 --> 4450.98]  So can you read the front of it?
[4451.04 --> 4452.24]  Can you read this box for me?
[4452.24 --> 4458.78]  Okay, for people who don't know what's going on, this was one of the few things that I wanted to see at CES and get my hands on.
[4458.86 --> 4465.14]  This is supposedly a bend-proof iPhone 6 Plus.
[4465.40 --> 4465.60]  Proof.
[4465.74 --> 4466.42]  Not resistant.
[4466.62 --> 4467.24]  Not resistant.
[4468.12 --> 4469.06]  You believe these guys?
[4469.16 --> 4469.64]  They're ridiculous.
[4469.64 --> 4472.32]  Defend against the bend.
[4472.50 --> 4474.26]  It is the trestle from Incipio.
[4474.80 --> 4477.94]  Now, the thing is, and I want to be clear, this is a prototype.
[4478.26 --> 4480.40]  Apparently, it will get even stronger.
[4481.02 --> 4482.54]  But that doesn't mean I'm not going to bend it.
[4482.54 --> 4485.76]  Do you have a phone here?
[4485.80 --> 4486.38]  Are we doing this?
[4486.54 --> 4487.64]  No, I don't have a 6 Plus.
[4487.84 --> 4490.50]  I'm going to hit up the Apple Store, Caesar's Palace after this.
[4490.92 --> 4493.04]  Guys, make sure you don't miss this.
[4493.22 --> 4496.50]  Okay, so, yeah, we're going to try to break the internet again, but probably won't happen.
[4496.90 --> 4497.84]  Maybe for Incipio.
[4497.90 --> 4498.84]  Maybe we'll break Incipio.
[4498.92 --> 4499.16]  I don't know.
[4499.36 --> 4502.46]  Could you bend the phone with your ass or something?
[4502.78 --> 4503.68]  Would that break the internet?
[4504.00 --> 4506.16]  That, I don't know.
[4506.16 --> 4507.14]  Do you boil up a little bit?
[4507.16 --> 4507.56]  I don't know.
[4507.64 --> 4509.46]  It depends on the type of viewers we're looking for.
[4509.46 --> 4514.40]  If you can balance the champagne glass while you bend the phone.
[4515.22 --> 4516.68]  Yes, that would break the internet.
[4516.68 --> 4517.32]  Yeah, probably.
[4517.80 --> 4523.32]  If you get Kim Kardashian to bend an iPhone 6 with champagne on her butt, there you go.
[4523.38 --> 4524.00]  Well, I don't know.
[4524.08 --> 4525.54]  We're going to need some Photoshop skills, though.
[4525.54 --> 4525.90]  Yes.
[4525.90 --> 4527.96]  Live up to the last image.
[4528.66 --> 4533.74]  But anyhow, yeah, so the concept here is that they have reinforced it with these rods,
[4533.74 --> 4537.86]  which are supposedly titanium or will eventually be titanium.
[4537.86 --> 4540.08]  I don't believe they are at this point.
[4540.52 --> 4545.52]  But basically, I mean, obviously I don't assume that this thing will ever be bend proof.
[4545.82 --> 4547.54]  What does that even mean, bend proof?
[4547.62 --> 4549.04]  Proof is an interesting thing.
[4549.12 --> 4553.06]  Like, we did a video where we were trying to check the fire resistance on a NAS.
[4553.20 --> 4553.44]  Yeah.
[4553.58 --> 4558.10]  And the whole time, all the firemen were like, yeah, there's nothing that's really, like, fireproof.
[4558.22 --> 4558.62]  Exactly.
[4558.94 --> 4559.14]  Yeah.
[4559.14 --> 4564.62]  It's all resistant because under a certain set of circumstances, you're going to mess anything up.
[4564.62 --> 4565.34]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4565.38 --> 4569.50]  And so I suppose in this particular case, they just went a little bit far on the branding
[4569.50 --> 4572.26]  and probably the retail box won't say bend proof.
[4572.38 --> 4572.54]  No.
[4573.82 --> 4576.32]  That's something they're going to want to change.
[4576.40 --> 4578.62]  But the crazy part was when they did it, when I gave it to me, it was like,
[4578.72 --> 4582.10]  this phone wouldn't exist if it wasn't for my original video.
[4582.10 --> 4584.54]  And I'm not saying that, like, to blow myself up.
[4584.56 --> 4586.18]  To be clear of the case, not the phone.
[4586.26 --> 4587.10]  Oh, did I say phone?
[4587.22 --> 4587.40]  Yeah.
[4587.92 --> 4590.78]  The iPhone 6 Plus never would have happened if they didn't know I was going to bend.
[4590.80 --> 4590.94]  No.
[4592.04 --> 4595.46]  Yeah, the case, it's like a result, a response to the hype from the video.
[4595.62 --> 4595.78]  Yeah.
[4595.88 --> 4599.70]  So it seems kind of crazy that we wouldn't work together on how to do a piece of content around it.
[4599.78 --> 4602.70]  That's actually specifically what I thought when they said they wouldn't give it to you.
[4602.74 --> 4604.44]  I was like, why not even let them try the prototype?
[4604.56 --> 4606.24]  And if it doesn't work, just be like, we'll do it better.
[4606.32 --> 4606.68]  Exactly.
[4606.72 --> 4606.96]  Whatever.
[4607.24 --> 4607.54]  Who cares?
[4607.54 --> 4607.98]  Embrace it.
[4608.10 --> 4609.20]  Have the conversation.
[4609.44 --> 4609.54]  Yeah.
[4609.54 --> 4612.08]  But what I figured out was,
[4612.10 --> 4615.88]  out here in these shows and on the show floor and stuff is it's like, you know,
[4615.90 --> 4618.64]  the people who are working in those booths, they got no clue, right?
[4618.64 --> 4618.80]  Yeah.
[4618.96 --> 4619.10]  Yeah.
[4619.10 --> 4622.98]  I mean, this makes or breaks a huge chunk of PR for this company.
[4623.02 --> 4624.56]  How much do they spend for that real estate?
[4624.88 --> 4625.20]  Right?
[4625.32 --> 4625.44]  Yeah.
[4625.58 --> 4626.52]  You're still doing it, though.
[4626.58 --> 4627.24]  No, I am still doing it.
[4627.24 --> 4630.46]  And maybe it'll make even more of a story because they tried to not let you do it.
[4630.64 --> 4631.32]  Maybe they wanted this.
[4631.32 --> 4632.12]  I don't think so.
[4632.26 --> 4636.04]  I wouldn't want the PR that I didn't want someone to test my product.
[4636.16 --> 4636.58]  That's true.
[4636.78 --> 4637.06]  Right.
[4637.44 --> 4639.24]  Especially someone as handsome as Lou.
[4639.32 --> 4639.78]  That's right.
[4640.18 --> 4640.42]  See?
[4640.42 --> 4641.68]  Because I do it big time.
[4641.84 --> 4642.40]  All the time.
[4643.48 --> 4644.18]  Oh, wow.
[4645.42 --> 4646.64]  You invited me here.
[4646.78 --> 4647.10]  I agree.
[4647.10 --> 4648.02]  You invited me here.
[4648.02 --> 4648.46]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4648.80 --> 4650.10]  Did I invite you here?
[4650.10 --> 4650.26]  I don't know.
[4650.34 --> 4651.38]  Actually, I think I invited myself.
[4651.42 --> 4652.48]  I think I invited Austin here.
[4652.48 --> 4653.78]  Oh, Big John needs some credit.
[4653.88 --> 4654.50]  I gave you credit.
[4654.50 --> 4654.52]  Oh, no.
[4654.52 --> 4655.16]  I don't need credit.
[4655.28 --> 4655.68]  Oh, okay.
[4655.98 --> 4657.22]  No, but you blew my cover, though.
[4657.48 --> 4657.82]  Did I?
[4657.82 --> 4659.08]  I was going to be like, oh, my God.
[4659.12 --> 4659.78]  I handed it off.
[4659.88 --> 4660.60]  I didn't know what happened.
[4660.88 --> 4661.90]  Oh, I stole it from you.
[4661.98 --> 4662.96]  I stole it out of his bag.
[4663.04 --> 4663.40]  No, no, no.
[4663.40 --> 4663.64]  John.
[4663.94 --> 4664.14]  John.
[4664.24 --> 4669.62]  Anybody who watched my last video leading up to it, you saw a little glimpse of us trying
[4669.62 --> 4673.90]  to get our hands on this on our first day on the show floor, and both Austin and John
[4673.90 --> 4676.60]  tried the first time and got shut down.
[4676.76 --> 4681.72]  I got shut down, then the two of them got shut down, and then final day, Big John making
[4681.72 --> 4682.14]  it happen.
[4682.58 --> 4684.52]  The worst part about it, she was so nice.
[4686.54 --> 4687.60]  I'm so sorry.
[4687.70 --> 4688.78]  The first one was rude.
[4689.42 --> 4690.14]  There you go.
[4690.38 --> 4691.50]  She did the whole life.
[4691.68 --> 4696.36]  Truthfully, truthfully, I'm going to be very, very clear in the piece of content that I create
[4696.36 --> 4701.46]  about this, that it is a prototype, and that, of course, nothing is bend-proof.
[4701.50 --> 4702.58]  I'm going to be clear about that.
[4702.70 --> 4706.74]  And truthfully, a little bit of extra rigidity can't be a bad thing.
[4706.84 --> 4706.94]  Yeah.
[4707.08 --> 4707.22]  No.
[4707.42 --> 4707.56]  Yeah.
[4707.70 --> 4711.46]  It might make it, like, very highly bend-resistant.
[4711.76 --> 4712.20]  There you go.
[4712.24 --> 4713.60]  Enough that it's probably not a problem.
[4713.60 --> 4713.98]  There you go.
[4714.04 --> 4717.12]  And if that is the conclusion of my video, guess what's going to happen?
[4717.26 --> 4718.82]  They're going to sell a lot of these cases.
[4718.82 --> 4720.38]  So, Incipio, I love you.
[4720.66 --> 4721.50]  You should love me, too.
[4722.54 --> 4723.32]  Yeah, yeah.
[4723.68 --> 4726.14]  You should love me, but I'm going to abuse you.
[4726.36 --> 4728.40]  But you should love me after that.
[4728.40 --> 4729.18]  It's an abusive relationship.
[4729.18 --> 4729.96]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4730.96 --> 4734.02]  You're just, you're showing your love through the hurt that you give them.
[4734.66 --> 4735.32]  Yeah, yeah.
[4735.72 --> 4736.20]  Hey, Marcus.
[4736.22 --> 4737.82]  This conversation just took a turn.
[4737.98 --> 4739.36]  Did you see the Zen phone, too?
[4739.70 --> 4740.58]  I did not.
[4740.82 --> 4742.08]  And I meant to, also.
[4742.28 --> 4743.72]  Like, I heard about it a lot.
[4743.88 --> 4745.20]  And I heard, oh, are this the people?
[4745.32 --> 4746.84]  But I never got to it.
[4747.02 --> 4749.08]  Oh, I would have loved to get your take on it.
[4749.18 --> 4750.02]  That is such a shame.
[4750.14 --> 4750.38]  Okay.
[4750.56 --> 4750.94]  All right.
[4751.36 --> 4752.16]  I'm sure you'll see it.
[4752.18 --> 4753.32]  I'm sure you'll look at it eventually.
[4753.52 --> 4753.86]  Probably, yeah.
[4753.94 --> 4754.60]  I'll probably have a video.
[4754.70 --> 4755.02]  Okay.
[4755.76 --> 4756.10]  Okay.
[4756.36 --> 4760.48]  Either way, if we want to not stay in Vegas.
[4760.96 --> 4761.40]  Right.
[4761.70 --> 4761.92]  Yeah.
[4762.40 --> 4762.76]  Okay.
[4762.94 --> 4763.66]  We should probably.
[4763.78 --> 4764.18]  This is pretty fun, guys.
[4764.54 --> 4769.86]  So, can we at least get, like, everyone to kind of jump in and we'll do a sign off?
[4769.92 --> 4771.70]  We get to stay in the suite after you guys leave, right?
[4771.94 --> 4772.94]  No, absolutely not.
[4773.30 --> 4773.86]  It's not mine.
[4774.00 --> 4774.68]  Not a chance.
[4774.68 --> 4776.10]  So, awesome show.
[4776.10 --> 4782.96]  We got 7,000 people tuned in to see by far the biggest collab that we've ever had the pleasure of hosting.
[4783.00 --> 4783.06]  Wow.
[4783.06 --> 4783.82]  Look at this frame.
[4784.18 --> 4785.10]  So, damn.
[4786.10 --> 4786.78]  Look at this.
[4786.96 --> 4787.14]  This is...
[4787.14 --> 4789.10]  Somebody fill in over...
[4789.10 --> 4789.56]  I'm a botan.
[4789.72 --> 4790.90]  We did everyone in one frame?
[4790.90 --> 4791.20]  Wait, wait, wait.
[4791.20 --> 4791.46]  Yeah.
[4791.70 --> 4793.18]  We got room on that side.
[4793.54 --> 4794.30]  I'll move over.
[4794.48 --> 4795.20]  I'll move over.
[4795.32 --> 4795.96]  I'll move over.
[4795.96 --> 4796.32]  That's right.
[4796.32 --> 4796.92]  Hey.
[4796.92 --> 4800.18]  All right.
[4800.48 --> 4802.52]  So, thank you guys so much for tuning in.
[4802.60 --> 4804.80]  We've had all the Linus Media Group guys here.
[4804.88 --> 4806.24]  We've got the TLD Today crew.
[4806.36 --> 4807.14]  We've got Austin.
[4807.30 --> 4808.14]  We've got Marcus.
[4808.52 --> 4809.52]  We've got Lou.
[4809.68 --> 4811.26]  We've got your average consumer.
[4811.74 --> 4813.44]  And this has been a ton of fun.
[4813.80 --> 4817.12]  And, of course, the archive will be up later for those of you who missed it.
[4817.12 --> 4819.34]  I think that's pretty much all there is to it.
[4819.58 --> 4820.32]  Peace, guys.
[4820.80 --> 4821.16]  See you.
[4821.34 --> 4821.66]  Bye.
[4825.10 --> 4825.92]  And show.
[4825.92 --> 4827.06]  Man show.
[4828.22 --> 4828.78]  What's up, guys?
[4828.78 --> 4830.46]  I see your voice is, like, gone.
[4832.32 --> 4834.38]  I was trying to have ginger tea last night, but nobody else.
[4834.78 --> 4835.00]  No.
[4835.30 --> 4835.88]  That would be good.
[4839.40 --> 4840.56]  So, that was the win show.
[4841.16 --> 4842.16]  That was the win show.
[4842.24 --> 4846.12]  It's still technically live for the outro world, but nah.
