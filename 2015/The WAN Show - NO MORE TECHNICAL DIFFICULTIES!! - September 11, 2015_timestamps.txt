[2015-09-13T00:49:28Z] Video: The WAN Show - NO MORE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES!! - September 11, 2015 
I wish this was timestamp indexed. I dont have a free hour and a half to watch the whole show.
I remember the days when you could have 2 whole cpus in your system. But as a gamer I had no use for them. Was still cool though. I also recall buying a new CPU every year to two years. Ive had my 2600k for 4 years!
Â EDIT : NM I see Suppy fixed that..thanks !!
