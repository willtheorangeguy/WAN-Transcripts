[0.00 → 0.64] Linus.
[0.80 → 1.00] Oh!
[1.68 → 2.42] It's show.
[2.64 → 3.08] We're carrying the couch.
[3.08 → 4.06] Linus is not here.
[4.44 → 6.12] Linus dropped the couch even though he's not here.
[6.42 → 8.04] Austin probably would have helped me carry it the whole way.
[8.24 → 8.92] Oh, I would totally.
[9.18 → 9.40] Yeah.
[9.76 → 10.12] Definitely.
[10.26 → 10.48] Yeah, for sure.
[11.20 → 12.78] Okay, the sound part's probably done.
[13.22 → 13.66] FreshBooks!
[13.82 → 14.20] Yeah!
[14.48 → 15.62] FreshBooks is awesome.
[15.80 → 17.52] Check out FreshBooks.com slash WAN.
[17.70 → 20.90] And you have to put WAN in the Who Sent You Here part.
[20.90 → 25.54] They do some really cool stuff for finances for small businesses and other cool things like that.
[25.82 → 26.80] Also, Dollar Shave Club.
[26.90 → 28.76] You can use it to shave hair on your face.
[29.04 → 29.54] And they're great.
[30.02 → 31.26] DollarShaveClub.com slash Linus.
[31.76 → 32.62] Back into the show.
[32.82 → 33.46] Okay, so.
[33.74 → 35.76] Apple Watch Edition thing.
[36.48 → 40.90] Okay, so what do you think about just the fact that there's going to be a $10,000 to what?
[40.96 → 42.92] Like $18,000 Apple Watch.
[43.16 → 46.08] I think that is a little insane.
[46.26 → 49.16] But I'm not too surprised considering it's a fashion wear item.
[49.16 → 50.24] I'm not surprised.
[50.68 → 52.08] I don't think anyone should buy it.
[52.66 → 52.98] I guess.
[52.98 → 53.10] Right.
[53.52 → 59.22] Because a lot of the different changes that they've been doing since Steve Jobs passed makes me not too surprised.
[59.22 → 60.34] They're going this angle.
[61.62 → 65.04] But yeah, I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone because it's freaking $10,000.
[65.58 → 65.84] Right.
[65.84 → 66.00] Yeah.
[66.22 → 74.02] I think that's an interesting point because, like you said, like, Steve Jobs never really did the crazy high premium stuff like this.
[74.06 → 74.22] Right?
[74.22 → 76.48] Like, yeah, Apple products have always been expensive.
[76.70 → 79.78] More expensive than, you know, what maybe some people think they're worth.
[79.86 → 81.68] But it's not been anything crazy, you know.
[81.80 → 84.68] And an average Joe could probably save up a little bit and get one.
[85.14 → 85.48] Exactly.
[85.60 → 88.98] And I think that's been one of the big draws of a lot of Apple products.
[89.04 → 92.78] I think the iPhone's a great example because it's not really more expensive than most other phones.
[92.78 → 97.84] At least if you're on contract, you know, everything's $200, whether it's, you know, HTC, Samsung, iPhone.
[97.98 → 102.46] So I think it was an interesting thing that everyone can buy an iPhone, and it's the exact same.
[102.56 → 107.06] Kind of like how, like, the old story of, like, you can buy a Coke, and it's the same anywhere, and it's the same price.
[107.12 → 107.72] Everyone can afford it.
[107.74 → 109.68] So, like, I thought that was kind of an interesting thing.
[109.72 → 111.80] But you look at something like the Apple Watch Edition.
[111.90 → 112.90] I mean, this is $10,000.
[113.22 → 113.98] That's crazy.
[113.98 → 117.12] But I also don't think it's that crazy.
[117.30 → 123.70] There are people who buy Rolexes and I don't think anyone's going to walk up to you and say, you know, you kind of overpriced for that, overpaid for that Rolex.
[123.92 → 124.72] You may want to reconsider.
[124.92 → 127.92] There's this great Casio that's $15 at Walmart.
[128.12 → 129.66] I mean, I'm saying it just does the same thing.
[129.74 → 130.38] It does the same things, man.
[130.92 → 133.14] Yeah, Casio used open source software on this.
[133.28 → 133.80] Come on.
[134.56 → 136.56] So, like, I get it.
[136.64 → 139.44] Like, like you said, I'm not going to buy an Apple Watch Edition.
[139.54 → 140.24] That would be insane.
[140.54 → 142.34] But I can't hate on someone who does.
[142.34 → 145.68] I mean, there's people who pay, you know, tons of money for, like, a gold Lamborghini.
[146.10 → 147.44] I wouldn't buy one of those either.
[147.54 → 149.68] But I'm not going to hate on you for buying one.
[150.04 → 150.90] So, I don't know.
[150.96 → 152.82] It is cool, though, that they're letting you skip the lines.
[152.94 → 159.30] I feel like my $10,000 is going to be well spent because I don't have to stand in line with all the peasants who are buying their $1,000 watches.
[159.44 → 161.08] I don't want to be associated with those guys.
[161.16 → 162.54] I've got to go straight to the front of the line.
[162.70 → 162.96] Wow.
[163.36 → 164.84] You sound like Linus right now.
[165.56 → 167.60] Yeah, and, like, I guess it's the same kind of thing.
[167.60 → 173.38] Like, I would look at a golden Lamborghini and go, like, wow, that seems like a very poor investment idea.
[174.38 → 179.16] And I would look at a $10,000 Apple Watch and be like, wow, that seems like a very poor whatever.
[179.38 → 182.24] But I'd also look at it and go, like, oh, that's kind of interesting.
[182.78 → 185.34] I'm not super personally interested in a golden Lamborghini.
[185.48 → 188.58] I'm also not super personally interested in a $10,000 freaking Apple Watch.
[188.74 → 189.72] I wouldn't buy either.
[189.72 → 195.28] And my mind has them so far away from possibilities that I don't even, like, I don't even want it.
[195.66 → 196.62] What would you do with it?
[196.68 → 198.76] I'm just starting to imagine, like, wearing a $10,000 watch.
[198.88 → 202.20] Like, I wouldn't, like, someone sees it, they would just, you know, take it off my wrist.
[202.34 → 203.84] It would be stolen in, like, a week.
[204.12 → 204.32] Oh, yeah.
[204.34 → 208.50] You know, you'd scratch it and go, oh, that was $3,000 worth of gold I just left on that countertop.
[208.96 → 210.08] It would be horrifying.
[210.50 → 211.68] I wouldn't even want one.
[211.78 → 213.64] If I had one, it would just be, like, in a case.
[213.72 → 214.94] I would, I don't know.
[215.52 → 217.06] It's just, it's ridiculous to me.
[217.06 → 220.20] But then again, I'm not the kind of guy who would ever buy a $10,000 watch anyway.
[220.62 → 228.26] No, but if you were, do you feel like you should be able to cut the line and have an extra one-hour private consultation with an Apple Watch expert?
[229.22 → 231.24] One of my favourite things is how they phrase it.
[231.52 → 239.64] The employees are being told that the journey for buying an edition is intended to be extremely personal, elegant, and purposeful.
[240.08 → 240.98] Like, oh, God.
[241.66 → 246.48] By the way, this elegant, purposeful journey ends with you giving us a check for $10,000.
[247.06 → 248.44] Don't forget that part, right?
[248.64 → 250.88] It's super awesome, but we want your money.
[251.14 → 251.30] Yeah.
[251.38 → 256.22] I think the bigger question about this whole deal, I know we don't want to talk about the gold Apple Watch for, like, 30 minutes.
[256.34 → 260.34] But what are you going to do with this thing next year when there's going to be a new Apple Watch that's better?
[260.76 → 263.42] Like, sure, I can see upgrading a phone, like, every two years.
[263.56 → 265.96] Like, it's, okay, it's a few hundred dollars, but it's not, nothing crazy.
[266.52 → 269.52] Am I going to have a $10,000 outdated watch a year from now?
[269.52 → 269.96] Yeah.
[270.58 → 280.72] That's a big thing, too, because the Rolex example and the Lamb example, like, if you have a Gallardo, Gallardo's still super badass in however many years.
[280.94 → 281.62] It's completely useless.
[281.72 → 283.70] It's completely useless 12 months later, dude.
[283.72 → 284.80] I don't know what you're talking about.
[284.94 → 286.06] It doesn't even work anymore.
[286.32 → 289.30] Like, if someone rolls up in a Testators or a freaking DeLorean.
[289.44 → 290.78] Okay, we've got to talk about that in a second.
[291.22 → 294.46] If someone rolls up in a Testators, like, that's sick.
[294.64 → 301.14] If someone has an old, like, however old Rolex, the older probably even the better, to be completely honest.
[301.44 → 302.30] It's super badass.
[303.42 → 306.70] This thing is going to be junk the second everyone comes out.
[306.74 → 311.38] Yeah, because, I mean, like you said, like, you look at a Rolex, it's, like, such fine, like, machinery and craftsmanship.
[311.60 → 312.60] Like, it's insane.
[312.84 → 316.00] And, you know, it does the exact same thing that every other Rolex has ever done.
[316.04 → 316.72] It tells time.
[317.08 → 319.60] And, I mean, obviously, the Apple Watch does do more than tell time.
[319.60 → 320.74] You've got to give it some credit there.
[320.88 → 330.88] But I don't think it's going to have that same kind of mystique 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 years from now as a really finely machined Rolex will.
[331.04 → 331.80] So, I don't know.
[332.10 → 332.20] Yeah.
[332.74 → 336.66] And, like, the new, brand-new Rolex might be a better dive watch.
[336.94 → 340.56] But it's going to be just as good at telling time as the new one, most likely.
[340.92 → 343.28] So, the Apple Watch will be worse.
[343.82 → 348.94] Very, very objectively worse than the new one at doing a bunch of stuff whenever the new one comes out.
[348.94 → 353.22] Unless they have some kind of, like, trade-in program where, like, they'll upgrade your watch or something.
[353.46 → 353.64] Right.
[353.64 → 357.04] Which I get, I mean, for $10,000, not completely insane.
[357.28 → 357.46] Yeah.
[357.46 → 364.08] But still, not, like, the greatest solution to having to send in your $10,000 watch at UPS every week.
[364.08 → 368.24] UPS guy's like, uh, this box got lost.
[368.64 → 369.28] So, how much?
[369.28 → 369.54] My bad.
[369.94 → 371.82] Sir, so, this comes with $100 of insurance.
[371.90 → 372.46] Do you want any more?
[372.72 → 375.26] Yeah, can I get $9,900 of insurance added?
[376.20 → 377.46] Uh, okay.
[377.46 → 380.76] Sure, yeah.
[381.30 → 383.74] If anyone in the chat was wondering, there's the link.
[383.86 → 384.74] I should have posted that earlier.
[384.86 → 385.60] That was my bad.
[386.24 → 388.58] Um, yeah, I guess moving on.
[388.70 → 392.30] Microsoft has unleashed Project Spartan Preview with the next Windows 10 build.
[392.54 → 398.00] Another thing I always warn people when I bring up Windows 10 builds is that there is a keylogger on Windows 10.
[398.12 → 399.08] I don't know if it's still there.
[399.28 → 400.54] It definitely was there before.
[401.10 → 401.38] I'm sorry.
[401.74 → 401.90] What?
[401.90 → 405.24] Uh, it's in the like, terms of service or whatever when you sign up.
[405.36 → 407.66] And it's not there to harvest your password.
[407.98 → 411.62] It's there to, and, like, they're very open about the idea that it's there.
[411.66 → 412.62] And they're not trying to hide it.
[412.92 → 414.10] Um, I don't know if it's still there.
[414.28 → 415.46] So, if someone is still there.
[415.46 → 417.78] Okay, I installed a Windows 10 build and I didn't know anything about it.
[417.82 → 419.16] So, I don't know how open they're being.
[419.30 → 422.36] They're not like, there is a keylogger on your system.
[422.62 → 424.76] But it's in, like, it's in the TOS or whatever.
[424.80 → 426.16] You have to read the fine print, which is stupid.
[426.16 → 427.12] I don't think that counts as open.
[427.28 → 431.48] I think that's, like, if you're, like, part of the 0.01% who read that,
[431.48 → 432.42] then, I don't know.
[432.50 → 433.04] That's a little sketchy.
[433.12 → 434.08] So, what is it for?
[434.16 → 434.84] It's not for, like, just.
[435.18 → 438.88] It's supposed to be there to see how people are using it.
[438.94 → 441.28] And if something breaks and you, like, send the report,
[441.40 → 444.56] they would have the keylogger data of before the report.
[445.04 → 448.94] So, they can kind of see, like, okay, well, they did this stuff and it broke.
[449.22 → 450.16] Okay, that makes sense.
[450.32 → 451.88] That's what it's supposed to be there for.
[451.98 → 454.00] It sketches me out, so I don't like it.
[454.64 → 455.00] Yeah.
[456.00 → 457.10] But Project Spartan.
[457.68 → 458.08] Yeah.
[458.46 → 458.62] Woo!
[459.56 → 460.82] Um, I don't know.
[460.82 → 461.82] It's pretty cool.
[461.94 → 465.62] Apparently, it's going to be replacing, not completely replacing Internet Explorer.
[465.82 → 466.84] Internet Explorer will still exist.
[467.14 → 471.10] But it will be replacing Internet Explorer's pinned and taskbar positions.
[471.40 → 473.94] So, pinned in the start menu and pinned on the taskbar positions.
[474.14 → 479.04] Which will pretty much completely replace it for a lot of the people that were using IE.
[479.56 → 479.84] Right.
[480.08 → 481.30] And that's a good thing.
[481.30 → 481.98] Because the reason why a lot of people were using it.
[482.06 → 482.34] Yes.
[482.74 → 484.40] And that is very true.
[484.64 → 489.14] Because a lot of the reasons why people were using IE was because it was default and in those positions.
[489.14 → 490.50] Right, yeah.
[491.02 → 492.60] And it's also supposed to be faster, right?
[493.18 → 494.26] Yeah, it's supposed to be faster.
[494.34 → 497.42] There's a bunch of other really cool features like annotation notes.
[497.52 → 502.30] So, you can essentially take like a snapshot of a webpage, but it's still a bit functional.
[502.58 → 503.46] It's not a screenshot.
[503.60 → 504.98] You can still click on links and everything.
[504.98 → 506.98] Oh, wow.
[506.98 → 508.70] And you can like to draw on it, and you can collaboratively mark it up.
[509.12 → 512.88] So, like if I was working on a...
[512.88 → 514.32] I actually really like this.
[514.44 → 517.62] If I was working on development of a website, I could send someone like...
[517.62 → 520.64] I'm sure they have a word for it that I'm not properly calling it.
[520.64 → 523.28] But I could send someone this snapshot thing that I'm talking about.
[523.58 → 527.40] Mark it up with like, okay, I want this padding to be a little bit wider.
[527.52 → 528.62] I want this colour to change.
[528.66 → 529.74] I want all these things done.
[530.38 → 531.64] I'm going to work on this part.
[531.70 → 534.20] If you can do those, we'll like mark it up and then send it to them.
[534.38 → 535.64] And you can still mess with it.
[535.68 → 536.60] You can still click on things.
[536.72 → 537.52] I think that's really cool.
[537.76 → 540.06] It's kind of like a Google Docs screenshot, kind of.
[540.22 → 541.40] Yeah, yeah, kind of.
[542.68 → 544.64] It's locked in time.
[544.92 → 549.12] So, if there were updates under that page, like if someone did an edit or something, you wouldn't get that edit.
[549.90 → 550.14] Right.
[550.14 → 556.54] But it's still clickable, and you'd be able to like to watch the embedded YouTube video that might be there or whatever, which is actually pretty cool.
[557.02 → 557.20] Yeah.
[557.20 → 564.62] So, I played around with the very original like Project Spartan renderer in the first build of Windows 10.
[564.70 → 565.86] I did a little bit of a browser test.
[566.40 → 570.26] And I remember finding that it was not really a huge difference.
[570.34 → 573.90] I don't think it had changed any part of Internet Explorer besides the JavaScript side.
[574.06 → 578.26] And it was pretty much caught up with like Safari and Opera and Firefox and Chrome.
[578.26 → 584.28] So, I'd be interested to see if it's kind of caught up on the rest of the browser side stuff with this newer build.
[584.40 → 587.68] Because from the early side of what I saw, it looked pretty decent.
[587.76 → 590.04] It looked like it was kind of a browser that I actually wouldn't mind using.
[590.40 → 590.72] Yeah.
[590.72 → 593.82] And the Cortana integration is genuinely interesting.
[594.14 → 595.90] Sorry, I'm doing something on the computer for a second.
[596.10 → 599.94] But like I like that it's supposed to be the personal assistant idea.
[600.06 → 601.02] That's actually really cool.
[601.38 → 604.94] Because and this gets, I think, overshadowed a little bit.
[604.94 → 610.24] But if you look on a restaurant's website, I was doing this literally today.
[611.66 → 615.66] It can give you essentially quick links to stuff like their menus.
[615.92 → 618.46] Or if there's like Yelp reviews, those will be there.
[618.54 → 620.44] Like everything kind of comes in on the side.
[620.90 → 625.82] And if I'm like, oh, Beatnik's Bistro, this place that I've gone to a few times.
[625.92 → 627.12] Do they have a breakfast menu?
[627.26 → 628.70] This is exactly what I was doing.
[629.64 → 629.78] Yeah.
[629.78 → 631.66] It's like, I don't know.
[631.74 → 632.26] Where is it?
[632.26 → 635.02] Okay, our food is apparently their menus tab.
[635.16 → 639.26] Like it would have been not that much easier, but easier if it just popped in the side.
[639.48 → 640.86] Bunch of reviews of their food.
[641.56 → 642.70] Where their menus are.
[642.78 → 643.34] All that kind of stuff.
[643.42 → 644.24] Super easy to find.
[644.36 → 645.16] I like that.
[645.42 → 646.60] Time savers are great.
[646.72 → 648.62] Personal assistants are a really cool idea.
[649.08 → 651.46] So the question is, do they actually have a breakfast menu?
[651.84 → 652.36] They do.
[652.76 → 656.26] But when you click on the breakfast menu, it's just like brunch menu.
[656.88 → 658.62] Oh, that's not a breakfast menu.
[658.74 → 659.42] That's a brunch menu.
[659.42 → 660.36] Two different things.
[660.56 → 660.68] Yeah.
[660.68 → 662.62] It's titled breakfast menu.
[662.76 → 663.34] You click on it.
[663.38 → 664.24] It gives you an image.
[664.50 → 669.32] And like on the image of the physical menu that you get, it's like brunch menu.
[670.08 → 670.34] Okay.
[670.54 → 673.38] Were there like breakfast-y kind of foods on the brunch menu at least?
[673.62 → 675.88] There were a couple breakfast-y kind of foods.
[676.04 → 678.12] It opens at, I think, 10 or 10.30.
[678.56 → 680.50] Yeah, that's definitely kind of a brunch-y sort of thing.
[680.58 → 680.76] All right.
[681.14 → 681.68] I'll allow it.
[681.74 → 682.14] Sounds good.
[682.42 → 683.36] I'll allow it.
[683.58 → 685.22] They can continue to exist.
[685.60 → 685.90] Yes.
[685.90 → 688.88] So far, but they need to be careful with this brunch nonsense.
[691.36 → 697.20] Anyway, the Project Spartan preview will be available in build 10.049.
[697.58 → 699.12] Oh, that's my favourite build.
[699.28 → 699.56] I don't know.
[700.32 → 700.68] Obviously.
[700.94 → 701.56] 10.049.
[701.78 → 702.42] We hang out.
[702.42 → 705.78] Anyway, I need to jump back a little bit and ask you the DeLorean.
[706.56 → 706.80] Oh.
[706.88 → 707.66] What's up with the DeLorean?
[708.12 → 708.52] Okay.
[708.78 → 709.02] So.
[709.12 → 709.66] You need to know.
[710.20 → 712.50] So I posted on Instagram last night.
[712.74 → 715.94] I think the title is like New Whip, and it was a picture of a DeLorean.
[716.64 → 718.24] No, I didn't actually buy a DeLorean.
[718.80 → 721.40] So many people are like, oh, dude, do a video on it.
[721.50 → 721.98] Or just that.
[722.24 → 724.26] I was just at a museum and there was a DeLorean there.
[724.30 → 725.06] I just took a picture.
[725.32 → 727.96] I didn't think anyone would believe that I actually bought a DeLorean.
[728.12 → 732.86] Although, I will say that's on my bucket list of things that at some point in my life,
[732.90 → 734.00] I would like to own a DeLorean.
[734.28 → 734.48] Yeah.
[734.82 → 739.26] But that one was like 80 grand, and I was not going to pay $80,000 for a DeLorean.
[739.98 → 744.06] So maybe what I find like when the Apple Watch, like when people start trading in their
[744.06 → 747.24] Apple Watches, they might like trade in a DeLorean and like I can get it for like a
[747.24 → 750.18] little bit of a better price, but no DeLorean just yet.
[750.50 → 750.52] So.
[750.62 → 751.20] That's fantastic.
[751.54 → 755.70] The reason why I was so excited and the reason why I asked was my car that I bought when I
[755.70 → 760.50] was like 16 or whatever, I rode that thing directly into the ground and its engine like
[760.50 → 762.06] partially blew up on a bridge.
[762.60 → 762.84] And then.
[763.04 → 763.24] Good job.
[763.40 → 763.74] Good job.
[763.76 → 764.08] Thank you.
[764.16 → 764.48] Thank you.
[764.54 → 765.08] It was fantastic.
[765.54 → 770.04] When I replaced that, I hadn't been looking into buying cars for a super long time.
[770.32 → 771.70] So I was like, you know what?
[772.00 → 773.22] I should try to get a DeLorean.
[773.22 → 775.32] And no joke, that actually happened.
[775.62 → 779.78] And I did a bunch of research and I like actually sourced down some people that
[779.78 → 783.98] had DeLorean and I found some that were a lot more affordable than 80 grand.
[784.48 → 784.72] Okay.
[784.94 → 787.68] But they wouldn't be as in good shape at all.
[787.76 → 788.12] Right.
[788.28 → 788.96] Not even remotely.
[789.32 → 792.98] So a lot of it was going to take a lot of work, especially aesthetic work, like repairing
[792.98 → 794.60] some of the panels, which is not.
[794.60 → 796.20] Which is all stainless, right?
[796.32 → 796.68] Yeah.
[797.24 → 797.70] Oh, yeah.
[797.70 → 802.94] Well, isn't the company that bought like, didn't one company buy like all the parts?
[802.94 → 803.66] So, yeah.
[803.72 → 806.50] It's like this giant warehouse full of like brand new DeLorean parts.
[806.58 → 808.42] I think it's like Washington, maybe?
[808.62 → 809.06] I actually have.
[809.30 → 809.50] Yeah.
[809.72 → 812.48] But I've seen like the videos of, I think it's actually still called, I think they bought
[812.48 → 814.76] like the name, like DeLorean Motor Company or everything.
[814.80 → 815.14] Yeah, DMC.
[815.38 → 815.40] Yeah.
[815.40 → 819.48] Like I know they were building like some plug-in hybrid versions of like new DeLorean with
[819.48 → 820.94] all the old 80s parts.
[821.12 → 821.28] Yeah.
[821.34 → 821.94] It's really cool.
[822.04 → 823.32] I don't know if they've actually done it.
[823.60 → 825.54] I know they were talking about like prototypes and stuff.
[825.74 → 825.96] So.
[826.06 → 826.24] Wow.
[827.00 → 827.36] I don't know.
[827.40 → 827.86] That's pretty sick.
[827.92 → 829.20] That would be interesting to pay attention to.
[829.42 → 831.34] But yeah, I just thought it was funny that you posted that.
[831.40 → 833.42] I wasn't sure if you bought it or not, but I was like.
[833.72 → 836.94] I was surprised at how, like, I felt like most people realized it was a joke, but a ton
[836.94 → 838.14] of people thought I was real.
[838.28 → 838.52] I was like.
[838.52 → 838.64] Yeah.
[838.92 → 839.06] Yeah.
[839.06 → 839.38] Wow.
[839.48 → 839.80] Okay.
[839.86 → 840.14] Cool.
[840.26 → 840.74] Thank you.
[840.74 → 842.36] I appreciate the vote of confidence and everything.
[842.68 → 844.62] I'm that kind of baller who owns a DeLorean.
[844.98 → 846.26] Thank you guys in advance.
[846.42 → 849.52] But sadly, I don't quite live up to your expectations just yet.
[851.02 → 851.58] That's awesome.
[851.80 → 855.74] What gave me the little bit of thought that it might not have been real was that it was
[855.74 → 857.86] just like that very small section of the car.
[858.32 → 858.46] Yeah.
[858.46 → 861.62] And I just felt like if it was actually yours, you'd take like a picture from the inside
[861.62 → 862.04] or something.
[862.22 → 863.52] Oh, you put like a lot of thought in this.
[863.66 → 864.14] I did.
[864.22 → 864.48] I did.
[864.52 → 865.84] I got really excited, man.
[866.08 → 867.22] You could have asked me, right?
[867.56 → 868.98] Well, I wanted to ask you on the show.
[869.64 → 873.34] Oh, I was like, because I saw the Instagram post last night, and I was like, going to send
[873.34 → 873.94] you a message.
[873.96 → 875.88] And then I was like, I'll just ask him live.
[876.04 → 878.02] I just took because it was parched by like two other cars.
[878.08 → 881.14] So I got the closest shot I could see other cars.
[881.26 → 883.12] Like, oh, it's my garage, guys.
[884.58 → 887.34] You should have got it with the two other cars and then said it was your car.
[887.34 → 887.82] Oh, yeah.
[887.98 → 890.22] You know, there's like a Camaro and Lamborghini.
[890.48 → 891.10] All my cars.
[891.20 → 891.56] Don't worry.
[891.84 → 892.10] That's cool.
[892.10 → 893.34] Actually, that was Linus's Lamborghini.
[893.56 → 893.88] But yes.
[894.08 → 894.24] Yeah.
[894.28 → 895.08] He was just visiting.
[895.72 → 895.86] Right.
[895.86 → 897.28] Anyway.
[897.54 → 904.40] Next up, we have the HTC One E9 Plus, their latest phablet with a stunning screen.
[904.88 → 905.28] Stunning.
[905.66 → 906.04] Stunning.
[906.36 → 907.90] It has a where's its DP?
[909.04 → 910.44] Uh, 534 PPM.
[910.44 → 910.86] There we go.
[910.94 → 911.24] Yes.
[911.72 → 911.86] Holy crap.
[911.86 → 914.12] 5.5-inch quad HD display.
[914.76 → 917.54] Um, although the website lists that as a 1080p resolution.
[917.86 → 922.16] So I think they probably just screwed up because that's what the M9 is, right?
[922.28 → 922.60] Yes.
[923.00 → 923.18] Yeah.
[923.22 → 923.36] Right.
[923.36 → 925.10] Pretty sure that was just a mess-up.
[925.16 → 925.48] Yeah.
[925.64 → 929.30] But I mean, a 5.5 inch 2560 by 1440 screen.
[929.56 → 930.70] That's, you know, it's okay.
[930.82 → 934.64] I mean, you know, it's, it's got a couple pixels, like 534 per inch.
[934.78 → 934.94] Per inch.
[935.94 → 941.02] You know if I was going to put like a random number, like just take a guess, 534 is, you
[941.02 → 941.24] know?
[941.34 → 941.42] Yeah.
[941.42 → 941.52] Yeah.
[941.84 → 941.92] Yeah.
[941.92 → 943.78] Um, so it's half metal and half plastic.
[943.88 → 947.64] So this is going to be, I guess, is this going to be a step-down from the M9 or is this supposed
[947.64 → 948.56] to be like another flagship?
[949.50 → 951.38] Uh, I don't know.
[951.42 → 951.82] It's interesting.
[951.92 → 955.38] They've screwed up a lot of their own specs, which is frustrating because, uh, like you
[955.38 → 957.30] said, the screen, but then there's also RAM.
[957.46 → 962.28] It's supposed to be three gigabytes on their website listed as two, uh.
[962.28 → 966.88] It's also, it's also got a MediaTek chipset, which kind of tips me off.
[966.94 → 968.92] It's probably not all that high end.
[969.04 → 969.34] Yeah.
[969.40 → 972.86] And then, and then HTC has been doing a lot of full metal and this is half-and-half.
[973.18 → 973.50] Right.
[973.58 → 973.96] Exactly.
[974.06 → 974.20] Yeah.
[974.38 → 978.38] Actually the E, if I remember right, the E series actually has been like the, the step
[978.38 → 979.46] down from the M series.
[979.46 → 979.66] Right.
[979.76 → 979.94] I think.
[980.76 → 981.42] I think so.
[981.42 → 981.92] That would make sense.
[982.04 → 982.52] I hope I'm right.
[982.98 → 985.56] I don't know that off the top of my head, but that would make a lot of sense considering
[985.56 → 987.58] the plastic and considering the MediaTek chip.
[988.06 → 988.26] Yeah.
[988.48 → 989.18] So it's cool.
[989.24 → 990.98] There's no price or release date or anything yet.
[991.04 → 991.14] Nope.
[991.14 → 994.42] Actually it's, I just realized it's 7.49 millimetres thin, thick.
[994.72 → 997.52] I feel like that's actually quite a bit thinner than the M9.
[997.70 → 999.72] I think that's like somewhere in like the eight, eight and a half neighbourhood.
[999.92 → 1003.40] I should probably double-check what I'm saying before I say it, but.
[1003.42 → 1004.50] Give me one quick second.
[1004.60 → 1006.04] For some reason, Nick is calling me.
[1006.08 → 1006.76] I have no idea why.
[1006.82 → 1007.26] What's up, Nick?
[1007.40 → 1007.66] Uh-oh.
[1007.88 → 1008.32] You're on speaker.
[1008.32 → 1010.34] That's a terrible, that's a terrible thing.
[1010.60 → 1013.32] Because apparently your mic is way lower than Austin's.
[1013.82 → 1014.14] Oh.
[1014.52 → 1015.00] Uh-oh.
[1016.04 → 1016.24] So.
[1016.40 → 1016.72] Yeah.
[1017.04 → 1017.98] Just wanted to let you know.
[1018.36 → 1018.72] Okay.
[1018.90 → 1019.56] Thanks, Nick.
[1020.10 → 1020.74] Thank you.
[1020.74 → 1021.06] Bye.
[1022.00 → 1023.24] You sound fine on my end.
[1023.32 → 1023.72] That's weird.
[1023.98 → 1024.26] Yeah.
[1024.30 → 1025.88] I don't know what's going on with that.
[1025.98 → 1028.12] I checked the chat a few times and didn't see that.
[1028.90 → 1029.26] Hmm.
[1029.72 → 1031.06] You want to turn yours down a little bit?
[1031.60 → 1031.94] Oh, yeah.
[1031.94 → 1032.12] Okay.
[1032.16 → 1032.34] Yeah.
[1032.34 → 1033.54] Some people are talking about it.
[1033.82 → 1036.46] I don't know why it took them almost 20 minutes.
[1037.46 → 1038.84] They were probably doing it the whole time.
[1038.96 → 1039.88] I just wanted to bug people.
[1039.88 → 1041.70] So you want mine down or do you want to turn yours up?
[1041.88 → 1044.44] I can turn mine up a little bit.
[1045.00 → 1045.24] Okay.
[1045.30 → 1047.74] I can turn mine down, but I don't want to mess it up.
[1047.82 → 1050.42] Because I'm on Skype right now, so Skype's automatically changing.
[1050.86 → 1051.50] So I don't know how much.
[1051.94 → 1052.16] Yeah.
[1052.58 → 1053.56] I can turn it down a little bit.
[1053.56 → 1054.80] I turned mine up a bit.
[1055.92 → 1057.08] We'll see how that goes.
[1057.60 → 1058.28] Hopefully that works.
[1058.44 → 1059.92] I'll check in the chat in a little bit.
[1060.76 → 1067.56] Moving on from unreleased to a bunch of data messed up phones, we have the Amazon
[1067.56 → 1070.42] testing delivery drones in a secret location in Canada, which is probably DC.
[1070.42 → 1070.86] Secret.
[1073.38 → 1077.72] Which is great, because that's where I'm from, and this is awesome, and I have no problem
[1077.72 → 1078.06] with it.
[1078.20 → 1079.68] See, you guys are like cheating here, right?
[1079.92 → 1084.52] Amazon was doing all this kind of cool stuff, and then you guys get all their awesome drone
[1084.52 → 1085.10] technology.
[1085.26 → 1085.72] Like, come on.
[1085.96 → 1087.74] They've got to share with us.
[1087.92 → 1088.20] You know what that means?
[1088.20 → 1090.16] I guess the FAA is being...
[1090.16 → 1095.02] Yes, the FAA are being butts about it, which they might have some good ideas, but I'm happy
[1095.02 → 1095.80] that they're testing it here.
[1095.84 → 1096.36] I think that's cool.
[1096.36 → 1101.42] I like how Amazon was just like, oh, we'll just rock upwards a little bit.
[1101.62 → 1105.66] Yeah, I wonder, is there some other place on Earth we could do this exact same testing?
[1106.34 → 1108.08] Actually, isn't Amazon based in Seattle?
[1108.36 → 1109.36] Isn't that just a few miles?
[1109.36 → 1109.86] That's what I mean.
[1110.00 → 1110.34] A few miles.
[1110.34 → 1111.94] Let's just go up a little bit.
[1112.14 → 1113.20] That's why I said BC...
[1113.20 → 1118.02] There are a lot of reasons why BC is probably where this whole secret centre is, but BC makes
[1118.02 → 1119.34] a ton of sense for a few reasons.
[1120.12 → 1124.76] But yeah, they probably just drove a truck up with some of their equipment.
[1124.76 → 1125.82] They're like, all right, cool.
[1126.08 → 1126.40] We're here.
[1126.42 → 1127.14] Testing time.
[1127.20 → 1128.46] Yeah, that didn't take that long.
[1128.84 → 1129.90] I was talking to a friend of mine.
[1129.98 → 1134.56] I was like, well, even if Canada decides to freak out, which they probably won't because
[1134.56 → 1138.72] Canada has essentially been like, you can do whatever you want because we need more
[1138.72 → 1139.40] of you up here.
[1139.98 → 1140.50] I like it.
[1140.70 → 1141.94] Yeah, I'm down with that too.
[1141.94 → 1148.40] But even if Canada said basically no, Amazon could probably just buy an island and just
[1148.40 → 1149.10] test them there.
[1149.40 → 1151.06] They probably already have one at this point.
[1151.66 → 1151.86] Yeah.
[1152.00 → 1154.50] You're not going to stop them from trying these things out.
[1154.68 → 1155.46] Just, I don't know.
[1155.78 → 1156.10] Go with it.
[1156.10 → 1162.58] So I think it's interesting because didn't they do the original ad, was it a year ago
[1162.58 → 1163.20] or was it two?
[1163.32 → 1163.76] Something like that?
[1164.50 → 1165.46] It was a while back.
[1165.66 → 1165.90] Yeah.
[1166.22 → 1166.42] Yeah.
[1166.72 → 1166.88] Yeah.
[1166.88 → 1170.62] So I remember when I first saw that, it seemed so ridiculous.
[1170.88 → 1173.82] It seemed like there was no way that they were actually going to do this.
[1174.42 → 1174.82] Come on.
[1174.88 → 1179.18] But it seems like you hear stuff like this, and they've said on record, yeah, this is
[1179.18 → 1180.22] actually a thing we want to do.
[1180.30 → 1182.18] It might be three, five, seven.
[1182.44 → 1184.86] It could be a long time in the future.
[1185.28 → 1187.16] But this is something that we're interested in looking in.
[1187.24 → 1188.96] And so I got to thinking about it.
[1189.02 → 1194.80] And the amount of packages that Amazon actually ships via UPS, FedEx, post office, that kind
[1194.80 → 1196.44] of stuff, that's got to be enormous.
[1196.44 → 1196.92] Right?
[1197.04 → 1199.10] Like it's got to be just a huge, huge amount.
[1199.20 → 1205.52] And I felt guilty on multiple occasions when I buy like a $5 like tube of thermal paste
[1205.52 → 1209.06] and I have it overnighted via Prime to my house, like $2.
[1209.46 → 1213.40] It's like this totally cost them so much more money than it was actually worth.
[1213.64 → 1216.00] I almost feel like kind of guilty about when I do that.
[1216.30 → 1220.68] So you think maybe this drone stuff, while it still is going to be massively impractical
[1220.68 → 1223.90] and only for like a few places, you know, even in the best case scenario.
[1223.90 → 1228.20] But maybe this is kind of like a way of hedging their bets and not giving, you know, UPS and
[1228.20 → 1232.20] FedEx piles of money to ship everything all over the place.
[1232.20 → 1240.16] That's honestly probably a perfect point, especially with looking at, what is it called?
[1240.28 → 1240.80] Give me a second here.
[1240.80 → 1241.88] I'm going to try and find it in the dock.
[1241.96 → 1244.06] But anyway, they're releasing these little buttons.
[1244.20 → 1244.84] Have you seen that?
[1245.20 → 1245.66] Oh, yeah.
[1245.82 → 1246.14] Dash.
[1246.50 → 1246.82] Dash.
[1246.92 → 1247.10] Yes.
[1247.16 → 1248.90] The Dash Go buttons or whatever.
[1248.90 → 1253.70] I know it's a transitionary thing until they get something else set up or whatever.
[1253.80 → 1256.18] And there isn't a ton of products that it's available for so far.
[1256.58 → 1258.64] And some people thought it was an April Fool's joke, which it apparently isn't.
[1258.64 → 1258.94] I did.
[1259.22 → 1259.76] I absolutely.
[1259.94 → 1260.10] I did too.
[1260.48 → 1260.72] Yeah.
[1261.14 → 1262.28] Because it was on the 31st.
[1262.52 → 1262.80] Yes.
[1262.80 → 1264.70] And I saw a bunch of people tweeting it.
[1264.84 → 1269.76] And that was because people got, I guess the last couple of years, people have been starting April Fool's early.
[1269.98 → 1270.58] So I saw it on my Twitter.
[1270.68 → 1271.06] It's like, whatever.
[1271.36 → 1272.28] I go to Amazon.com.
[1272.32 → 1274.50] It's like this giant thing right up front.
[1274.60 → 1275.38] I was like, really?
[1275.86 → 1280.66] And so I signed up because it's free for if you're a Prime member.
[1280.70 → 1282.20] I think you can get up to three buttons.
[1282.66 → 1283.58] You probably should double-check that.
[1283.64 → 1283.80] Yeah.
[1283.88 → 1285.12] You can get up to three buttons.
[1285.60 → 1286.56] Do you have to pay after that?
[1287.60 → 1289.92] I have no idea what you do after the first three buttons.
[1289.92 → 1291.82] I don't know if they'll even give you more than three.
[1292.08 → 1292.74] I have no idea.
[1293.54 → 1295.50] But I think that, yeah, you can get up to three.
[1295.90 → 1297.32] They're for various different products.
[1297.42 → 1304.76] So you can get like, you know, you hit the button and, you know, it'll automatically order you more laundry detergent or diapers or whatever.
[1304.88 → 1306.74] I think it's about 18 different products.
[1306.84 → 1306.94] Yeah.
[1307.06 → 1308.54] Tide, Huggins, all kinds of stuff.
[1308.62 → 1310.96] So, you know, when I need more diapers, I just hit the button.
[1311.30 → 1311.50] Yeah.
[1311.98 → 1317.60] So I know they use the picture of like you put the Tide button on your washing machine.
[1317.98 → 1318.10] Yeah.
[1318.10 → 1319.38] Where do you put these other buttons?
[1319.38 → 1320.82] Where do you put the diaper button?
[1320.82 → 1323.32] Where do you put the toilet paper button?
[1323.38 → 1327.40] I'm just trying to think of, am I going to have a house full of buttons everywhere?
[1327.54 → 1330.10] I just want to walk in and go, oh, I want some of this.
[1330.18 → 1331.18] I want some of this.
[1331.24 → 1331.90] I want some of this.
[1332.26 → 1332.58] $300.
[1333.00 → 1333.24] Oops.
[1333.24 → 1333.80] Oops.
[1333.80 → 1333.84] Oops.
[1334.08 → 1334.32] Yeah.
[1334.88 → 1336.24] Oh, my.
[1336.66 → 1337.04] Oh, my.
[1337.32 → 1337.66] Oh, my.
[1337.66 → 1338.86] I, yeah, I don't know.
[1339.02 → 1342.58] I think with especially a lot of the stuff that's in this program, the drones would make
[1342.58 → 1342.90] sense.
[1343.06 → 1345.14] The button placement thing is pretty funny.
[1345.26 → 1348.86] I think this isn't going to make a ton of sense for people that have like little kids
[1348.86 → 1349.30] and stuff.
[1350.02 → 1350.22] Yeah.
[1350.30 → 1350.92] I think there is.
[1351.06 → 1351.48] Oh, button.
[1351.62 → 1352.46] Fun to press.
[1352.82 → 1353.72] $3,000.
[1354.04 → 1355.66] All automatically shipped with drones.
[1355.80 → 1356.40] You can't cancel.
[1356.58 → 1358.86] There's like a pallet of diapers shows up at your front door.
[1358.86 → 1360.50] You're like, oh, not again.
[1360.80 → 1361.14] Yeah.
[1361.32 → 1361.54] Yeah.
[1361.70 → 1362.04] I just.
[1362.30 → 1362.80] Oh, man.
[1362.86 → 1363.14] Ridiculous.
[1363.24 → 1364.00] And they're like, oh, yeah.
[1364.36 → 1367.20] If there's is you don't want any more, you can just cancel it on your phone.
[1367.48 → 1368.16] I'm like, yeah.
[1368.24 → 1369.86] Well, if it's already at my house.
[1370.08 → 1370.30] Yeah.
[1370.30 → 1370.84] I didn't know.
[1371.08 → 1372.56] Like, yeah, it emails you or whatever.
[1372.68 → 1373.50] OK, I'm at work.
[1373.58 → 1376.58] You shipped within an hour because you're amazing on Amazon.
[1377.22 → 1378.68] And now I can't cancel my order.
[1378.92 → 1382.12] So what I've got the question is, what's the deal with these buttons?
[1382.22 → 1382.30] Right.
[1382.32 → 1383.36] They seem very small.
[1383.50 → 1386.10] Some they believe they connect to your phone, right?
[1386.10 → 1390.78] I was wondering what that and like I was wondering about battery life and stuff.
[1390.84 → 1391.36] Yeah, exactly.
[1392.30 → 1394.84] And then these are pretty much one use buttons, right?
[1394.84 → 1395.60] Like you use it.
[1395.68 → 1396.08] I don't know.
[1396.30 → 1397.12] A year or two.
[1397.24 → 1398.12] Use it for a few times.
[1398.12 → 1399.20] And like what the battery gives up.
[1399.26 → 1399.76] You throw it away.
[1399.88 → 1401.66] That seems kind of a little sketchy to me.
[1401.78 → 1403.30] It does seem a little bit ridiculous.
[1404.04 → 1405.02] It's a cool idea.
[1405.56 → 1408.00] But I don't know how practical it's going to be.
[1408.50 → 1409.94] If it's especially in the long run.
[1410.00 → 1414.94] And like I know they've already basically publicly said that it's a transitionary piece.
[1415.10 → 1415.26] Right.
[1415.26 → 1419.28] So they're planning on having other ways of doing this.
[1419.40 → 1427.54] Like I think the idea is that they're supposed to be a dedicated dash like wow.
[1428.20 → 1429.06] The scanning code.
[1429.26 → 1429.90] QR code.
[1430.14 → 1432.80] I think they're supposed to be a dedicated dash QR code in all the products.
[1432.96 → 1434.56] Or some other version of a code.
[1434.70 → 1437.02] Some scanning bar or whatever that your phone can read.
[1437.28 → 1438.84] I think that's the eventual plan.
[1438.96 → 1443.18] But until they get a bunch of people on that, maybe not going to happen.
[1443.18 → 1445.12] Which is, I don't know, a little bit weird.
[1445.54 → 1448.44] But maybe the year, year and a half, two years might.
[1448.86 → 1450.14] Oh man, I'm going to say tide.
[1450.20 → 1451.80] And that's one of the companies that signed up for this.
[1452.02 → 1457.18] But might tide people over until they actually get this other system implemented.
[1457.68 → 1457.86] Yeah.
[1457.96 → 1461.40] And I think on top of that, you look just a little bit more into the future.
[1461.54 → 1461.88] I believe.
[1461.88 → 1464.86] I'm going to say this, and it might not be wrong.
[1464.94 → 1471.88] I believe it was that Samsung was the company who said that they want all of their products to be connected within the next like five or ten years.
[1471.88 → 1477.68] So you can imagine you go up to your refrigerator, and you can have Tide or sorry, Tide, Dash built in.
[1477.76 → 1479.04] So you can just look through.
[1479.30 → 1481.22] Maybe you can even automatically see what you've got.
[1481.34 → 1483.04] And like you scan it or whatever, and you put it in.
[1483.38 → 1486.38] You know, it can keep track of, you know, if your stuff's about to go out of date.
[1486.56 → 1488.34] If you need to, you know, get some more milk or whatever.
[1488.44 → 1489.90] And it can automatically be set in.
[1489.90 → 1502.24] So, yeah, I definitely feel like Dash for a lot of reasons is sort of like a stopgap, like a little bit of a transition between, you know, just having to order stuff on Amazon and not remembering and just realizing it's way easier just to go down to the store as opposed to waiting.
[1502.44 → 1506.54] Or if it's just something simple like your refrigerator automatically orders when you need more eggs or something.
[1506.60 → 1508.46] I think that's kind of where this is all headed.
[1508.90 → 1509.10] Yeah.
[1509.20 → 1514.66] And speaking of where this is all headed, because that was basically the best segue I've ever heard.
[1514.70 → 1515.08] Yeah, I know.
[1515.08 → 1516.44] Another topic that we have.
[1517.08 → 1519.50] Not even just that, but what you were just talking about.
[1519.50 → 1521.80] But IBM new Internet of Things unit.
[1521.96 → 1527.96] IBM is investing $3 billion over the next four years to solidify its efforts on the Internet of Things space.
[1528.06 → 1534.80] So, people like Samsung, like you were just talking about, all their products need to be connected, are very possibly going to work with people like IBM.
[1534.88 → 1539.40] IBM is this, like, massive patent house that just does the back end of, like, everything ever.
[1539.92 → 1542.74] Well, that's interesting to think of IBM as a massive patent house.
[1542.74 → 1545.08] You know, I usually don't – I wouldn't think of them like that.
[1545.12 → 1545.50] But you know what?
[1545.52 → 1546.20] You're totally right.
[1546.32 → 1548.14] That's actually an interesting way of looking at it.
[1548.32 → 1548.62] Wow.
[1548.62 → 1549.68] I guess that's what they are.
[1550.06 → 1554.82] Well, they've got $3 billion to throw around over the next four years.
[1554.98 → 1556.26] They're a huge company.
[1556.42 → 1560.48] They just don't have a ton of almost any anymore.
[1560.60 → 1562.38] Did they get rid of all their consumer-focused stuff?
[1563.00 → 1563.54] Oh, dude.
[1563.62 → 1565.44] I can't think of anything off the top of my head.
[1565.52 → 1565.84] That's for sure.
[1565.84 → 1570.46] I know they got rid of their, like, laptops and desktop kind of computer stuff not even that long ago.
[1570.56 → 1571.94] Yeah, they sold that to Lenovo, right?
[1572.12 → 1572.36] Yeah.
[1572.36 → 1573.96] They moved off hard drives.
[1575.08 → 1576.50] Yeah, I don't think – sorry?
[1576.56 → 1578.16] Servers and stuff, I guess?
[1578.32 → 1580.00] Yeah, but that's less consumer-focused.
[1580.00 → 1580.32] Right.
[1580.56 → 1580.90] Yeah.
[1581.24 → 1581.52] Interesting.
[1581.52 → 1588.14] So, I think the interesting thing about this is that you look at IBM, you look at all these different companies who are pouring tons and tons of money.
[1589.04 → 1590.04] There's – I don't know.
[1590.10 → 1597.38] I feel like the Internet of Things and wearables – I think a lot of these things, although they're separate categories, but I feel like a lot of these things are kind of converging.
[1597.38 → 1607.26] I remember I was at, like, a CES – I think it was, like, two or three years ago, and it was at the Intel CES conference, and they were talking about, yeah, we can't wait until, you know, the cost of compute is basically nothing, right?
[1607.28 → 1611.90] You can have, you know, a chip that's able to, you know, connect to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or whatever in everything.
[1612.06 → 1614.58] You can have it – you know, it's just – it's essentially free.
[1615.24 → 1617.48] It's tiny, tiny, tiny little chips that you can put everywhere.
[1617.80 → 1624.86] I feel like at first I was like, yeah, right, okay, I'm going to have, you know, a Wi-Fi connecting table and all this kind of stuff.
[1624.86 → 1626.92] But you hear more and more, like, stories about this.
[1626.92 → 1629.08] It's just like, wow, this is actually kind of happening.
[1629.28 → 1630.76] That's cool, I think.
[1631.08 → 1631.72] Yeah, yeah.
[1632.24 → 1635.46] I've been – one thing that I always really liked was the – what was it?
[1635.48 → 1637.94] Like, the original – wasn't it called the Surface?
[1638.08 → 1639.62] Way back in the day, the Microsoft table.
[1639.64 → 1640.80] Yeah, the big table.
[1640.98 → 1641.48] Yeah, yeah.
[1641.76 → 1645.10] And when they ordered pizza with that thing, that was so sick.
[1645.26 → 1649.60] The guy was just like, I want some pizza, and just – I think he swiped something and threw his credit card on it.
[1649.64 → 1651.38] It just scanned his credit card and pizza showed up.
[1651.44 → 1653.22] I was like, that's so cool.
[1653.22 → 1654.78] I want my table to be connected.
[1654.92 → 1655.34] Why not?
[1655.34 → 1659.92] Wasn't Pizza Hut one of, like, the very first websites that you actually, like, online order pizza?
[1660.12 → 1660.36] Yeah.
[1660.82 → 1663.80] Pizza's, like, the thing that drives all technology progress.
[1664.36 → 1667.00] If you use a computer today, you owe it to pizza.
[1667.60 → 1669.16] Give or take a little bit.
[1669.24 → 1669.80] But mostly.
[1670.18 → 1670.76] I mean, guess what?
[1670.88 → 1674.60] The guy who designed that computer you're using right now, he probably ate a lot of pizza.
[1674.74 → 1675.46] He probably did.
[1675.50 → 1676.14] You're welcome, pizza.
[1676.38 → 1676.72] Or thank you, pizza.
[1676.72 → 1680.48] You know, when I was doing a lot more developing stuff, I was eating a lot of pizza.
[1680.84 → 1681.24] No.
[1681.54 → 1681.90] Seriously?
[1681.90 → 1682.08] Yeah.
[1682.36 → 1682.52] Yeah.
[1682.66 → 1683.26] Dude, you know what?
[1683.32 → 1685.92] When I make my videos a lot of time, I eat pizza.
[1686.10 → 1686.96] Oh, my God.
[1687.02 → 1687.44] That's amazing.
[1687.44 → 1687.96] I can't believe it.
[1688.20 → 1691.08] This is – we found, like, what is actually driven 30 years.
[1691.08 → 1692.88] The unifying force of the universe.
[1693.16 → 1693.36] Yeah.
[1693.60 → 1694.22] So, pizza.
[1694.58 → 1694.74] Pizza.
[1694.74 → 1695.14] Thanks, pizza.
[1695.40 → 1696.04] We appreciate you.
[1696.24 → 1696.66] We love you.
[1696.66 → 1697.50] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[1698.26 → 1699.14] They knew it all along.
[1699.48 → 1703.28] Oh, I found the Dash article, so I'm going to post this and stream, like, totally nowhere close
[1703.28 → 1704.36] to when we were talking about it.
[1704.36 → 1709.32] But just in case anyone wanted to read up more on that, there you go.
[1709.50 → 1709.82] I don't know.
[1709.88 → 1711.96] I've had a lot of people telling me that's super stupid.
[1712.42 → 1713.60] I don't really think it is.
[1713.66 → 1714.88] I think it's fine.
[1715.10 → 1717.38] It might need to be deployed in specific ways.
[1717.72 → 1720.58] Like, if you have a little kid, like, make sure they can't press it.
[1720.76 → 1720.96] Yeah.
[1721.72 → 1725.36] If – like, I could see myself using them more likely.
[1725.46 → 1727.68] I don't have Prime, but maybe it's an interesting idea.
[1728.18 → 1731.10] One thing that I'm worried about is that there's not a ton of products on it so far.
[1731.10 → 1734.86] Right, and the buttons are not programmable from what I've seen.
[1735.02 → 1738.86] They all have, like, their own, you know, the graphic of whatever brand that you're ordering.
[1739.02 → 1740.16] So it's like Gillette or whatever.
[1740.42 → 1745.14] So that button is only going to be useful for one thing, which is a little weird, but –
[1745.14 → 1748.58] A little weird, and a lot of the brands that they're signing up for are, like, premium brands.
[1748.82 → 1750.90] A lot of times I buy super cheapo stuff.
[1751.28 → 1752.26] Yeah, that's a good point.
[1752.38 → 1753.60] So it might not be super useful for me.
[1753.88 → 1759.46] But especially, like, the single home thing where it's, like, one person living there,
[1759.46 → 1762.44] you buy something, you're probably going to have it for a long time.
[1762.86 → 1765.74] And then once it runs out, you're going to be like, oh, crap, I haven't thought about this
[1765.74 → 1767.32] because I haven't had to buy it in two months.
[1767.72 → 1769.50] So, okay, being able to press a button is kind of cool.
[1769.58 → 1771.50] And then you don't have little kids pressing it and all that kind of stuff.
[1771.82 → 1776.42] But I do worry about also social implications of it.
[1776.74 → 1778.72] My buddy comes over and sees a Tide button.
[1778.82 → 1779.52] It's like, what's that?
[1779.62 → 1781.84] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[1781.84 → 1782.62] It doesn't do anything.
[1782.72 → 1783.46] Click, click, click, click.
[1783.96 → 1784.24] Oh.
[1784.66 → 1786.86] I think you need a better buddy if that's the case.
[1786.86 → 1787.98] Yeah, I know.
[1788.12 → 1789.86] But, like, it's, I don't know, it's possible.
[1790.36 → 1794.86] Or, like, if one of my friends happened to have kids and came over and their kids were
[1794.86 → 1795.98] there or whatever, and they'd press it.
[1796.02 → 1796.74] Like, I don't know.
[1796.80 → 1797.74] There's weird stuff like that.
[1797.80 → 1799.62] It is, it would notify you, of course.
[1800.06 → 1801.16] But, I don't know.
[1801.46 → 1801.64] Yeah.
[1801.78 → 1807.36] It's, I'm really interested to see what people think about this in six months after it's released.
[1807.86 → 1808.22] Mm-hmm.
[1808.22 → 1808.26] Yeah, for sure.
[1808.26 → 1811.26] Like, if you're actually using it, what people have to say about it, all that kind of stuff.
[1811.92 → 1812.20] Yeah.
[1812.98 → 1813.52] All right.
[1813.86 → 1815.06] Moving on.
[1816.86 → 1820.20] So, there's the 20th anniversary GTX 980.
[1820.66 → 1821.04] Yes.
[1821.44 → 1822.86] That is, oh.
[1824.74 → 1826.56] Well, it's the Asus 20th anniversary.
[1826.94 → 1827.28] Yes.
[1827.48 → 1828.76] So, what's it clocked at, actually?
[1828.80 → 1831.44] It's, like, some insane, like, clock right out of the box, right?
[1832.20 → 1834.12] Hopefully, it's not in the notes for some reason.
[1834.24 → 1835.04] Nick, what are you doing?
[1836.04 → 1837.60] I remember reading this earlier today.
[1838.02 → 1839.24] I'm going to try and pick it up.
[1839.24 → 1841.24] It is, it's supposed to be insane.
[1841.30 → 1844.16] Isn't it the fastest out of the box 980 you can get?
[1844.32 → 1845.60] I think that's the whole thing.
[1845.60 → 1846.50] Yeah, I believe so.
[1846.60 → 1847.30] Actually, you know, that's weird.
[1847.36 → 1849.80] They don't actually have it on the Asus page.
[1849.80 → 1850.32] That's silly.
[1850.40 → 1850.90] Really obvious.
[1850.90 → 1851.68] Have you learned on talking to people yet?
[1852.98 → 1853.76] Safe mode.
[1854.30 → 1855.24] It's really cool, guys.
[1855.26 → 1855.76] It's fast.
[1855.86 → 1856.38] Just trust me.
[1856.58 → 1857.28] It's really fast.
[1857.30 → 1860.58] It has the faster modes, which is actually kind of cool, which is helpful for people if
[1860.58 → 1865.82] they're doing LN2, which will be probably not many or nobody in the audience, but it's
[1865.82 → 1866.12] possible.
[1866.38 → 1867.22] There's an RGB light.
[1867.22 → 1870.40] It looks freaking badass, and it's supposed to be superfast out of the box, which is
[1870.40 → 1870.58] cool.
[1870.84 → 1874.66] Hopefully, I'll be able to check it out and let people know what's going on.
[1874.72 → 1877.44] 14-phase power design, which is actually pretty sick.
[1878.76 → 1880.00] We don't see that often.
[1880.12 → 1883.80] I think some of the Kingpin Edition cards and stuff will have 14-phase power design.
[1884.68 → 1884.80] Yeah.
[1885.02 → 1888.76] Zero dB fan mode, although Linus has posted a video on how to do that on pretty much whatever
[1888.76 → 1889.24] you want.
[1889.32 → 1889.46] Yeah.
[1889.62 → 1891.04] Don't deal with this stuff.
[1891.10 → 1891.78] Just watch the video.
[1891.88 → 1893.00] It's all you actually need to know.
[1893.14 → 1895.88] These companies can pretend to do it, but Linus made the video.
[1895.94 → 1896.82] That's all you really need.
[1897.06 → 1897.34] Yeah.
[1897.64 → 1897.74] Yeah.
[1898.10 → 1901.56] Essentially, they didn't even release a graphics card until Linus makes the video.
[1901.60 → 1902.00] Exactly.
[1902.30 → 1903.64] It's all because of Linus.
[1903.70 → 1904.44] We all understand it.
[1904.50 → 1906.42] Linus and pizza make the world go around.
[1906.58 → 1906.78] Yeah.
[1907.26 → 1907.52] Basically.
[1908.12 → 1909.82] Mainly pizza, but Linus too.
[1910.40 → 1911.66] Linus has to review the pizza.
[1912.36 → 1912.68] Oh!
[1912.68 → 1913.00] Oh!
[1913.88 → 1914.76] That needs to happen.
[1915.08 → 1915.32] Yeah.
[1915.50 → 1916.00] That does need to happen.
[1916.02 → 1916.26] That needs to happen.
[1916.26 → 1917.90] Like, lose McDonald's.
[1918.20 → 1919.14] Oh, that was so good.
[1919.22 → 1919.78] That was so good.
[1919.80 → 1920.34] That was awesome.
[1920.56 → 1921.08] That was awesome.
[1923.00 → 1923.36] Awesome.
[1923.78 → 1928.04] Anyway, there's not a ton else to say about that card until we get it in hand other than
[1928.04 → 1928.22] that.
[1928.30 → 1932.60] 14-phase power design, 0 dB fan technology, memory defroster, a bunch of stuff for those
[1932.60 → 1933.16] kind of guys.
[1934.62 → 1938.78] One Press V BIOS reload, which is actually pretty sick, especially if you're going to be screwing
[1938.78 → 1943.24] around a lot, which is very probable if you're buying this card.
[1943.68 → 1943.94] Yeah.
[1944.70 → 1945.06] Yeah.
[1945.12 → 1945.40] I don't know.
[1945.46 → 1945.84] Pretty sick.
[1945.90 → 1948.64] I'd like to test it, so hopefully we'll get one, and I'll let you guys know later.
[1949.00 → 1954.36] Samsung is launching three more curved PC monitors, so Linus is probably freaking out
[1954.36 → 1956.94] about that over in wherever the hell he is right now.
[1957.02 → 1958.96] He's been going to many, many places.
[1959.48 → 1961.12] I'm going to post this in the chat as well.
[1961.20 → 1962.84] I'm doing a better job of that right now.
[1962.84 → 1967.86] So, I'm a little bit disappointed that I think they're all 1080p.
[1968.44 → 1968.80] Yes.
[1969.26 → 1972.44] So, it's a 24-inch, a 27-inch, and a 31-inch.
[1972.74 → 1972.96] Yeah.
[1973.28 → 1978.08] So, they started 300 bucks, so I think that's by far the cheapest curve monitor, right?
[1978.40 → 1979.52] I can't think of anything else.
[1979.64 → 1981.12] I'm not entirely sure about that.
[1981.16 → 1982.02] You're probably right.
[1982.28 → 1984.50] As far as I know off the top of my head, I think you're right, but I haven't checked
[1984.50 → 1985.08] that, so I don't know.
[1985.08 → 1988.68] I'm good at saying things and then like half a second after I say it, it's like, oh, I'm
[1988.68 → 1989.86] actually not sure about that.
[1989.86 → 1990.36] Yeah, yeah.
[1990.36 → 1993.70] That's the cheapest, I think, maybe.
[1993.88 → 1994.28] Probably.
[1994.54 → 1996.70] My favourite thing to say is, that's just a theory though.
[1997.06 → 1997.64] That's just a theory.
[1997.74 → 1998.50] I need to use that.
[1998.62 → 1999.42] I need to use that.
[2000.04 → 2003.84] Anyway, I'm a little bit disappointed that they're 1080p just because the curve monitors
[2003.84 → 2010.58] that I've tried in office that were 1080p were felt worse than a flat 1080p monitor.
[2010.98 → 2016.80] I think just because I noticed the resolution more, but the ultra-wise that we have that
[2016.80 → 2020.52] are 1440p and above are super crisp and very nice.
[2020.88 → 2021.96] So, I don't know.
[2022.08 → 2026.54] I'm sure Linus is going to try and get his hands on some of these, so we'll probably see
[2026.54 → 2027.24] a review of that.
[2027.60 → 2031.82] And he's done way more work with the new monitors than I have, so I'm sure he'll have something
[2031.82 → 2033.54] to say about them being 1080p or not.
[2034.10 → 2034.26] Yeah.
[2034.26 → 2041.12] Um, they've been bragging about the eye saver mode and the just natural eye saving, eye fatigue
[2041.12 → 2043.10] saving stuff of curved monitors.
[2043.22 → 2044.56] I've never had a problem with that.
[2044.90 → 2045.16] Yeah.
[2045.56 → 2048.10] I have a bunch of monitors all the time, so I don't know.
[2048.52 → 2049.98] My eyes need to be saved apparently?
[2050.28 → 2050.68] Yeah, yeah.
[2050.78 → 2052.42] I don't know.
[2052.90 → 2057.24] That's one thing I've been thinking about too, is like it's a, I'm going to always turn
[2057.24 → 2057.94] my whole head.
[2057.94 → 2063.38] And so, I don't know, I'll be, I'll be looking directly at that monitor, or I'll be looking
[2063.38 → 2064.90] directly at this monitor.
[2065.24 → 2066.22] Oh, right, right.
[2066.22 → 2067.84] My eyes are usually facing straight forward.
[2067.94 → 2070.50] I'm not like looking out of the corner of my eyes at things all the time.
[2070.96 → 2071.10] Right.
[2071.86 → 2072.14] Huh.
[2072.40 → 2072.58] Okay.
[2072.58 → 2074.66] Which I think might be what they're talking about.
[2074.68 → 2075.18] It might not be.
[2075.22 → 2075.48] I don't know.
[2075.68 → 2080.46] But the eye saver mode specifically decreases the amount of blue light emitted by the displays,
[2080.46 → 2085.14] not the I know they're talking about the natural curve can save your eyes that way,
[2085.14 → 2089.02] but the eye saver mode is reducing the natural blue light set up for this place, which is
[2089.02 → 2089.34] interesting.
[2089.58 → 2093.26] Speaking of different colours of light, I don't know why I'm bringing this up right now, but
[2093.26 → 2096.14] in fire engines, they illuminate the cab with red.
[2096.90 → 2101.26] Not just because it's a fire engine, but because red doesn't change your pupil.
[2102.34 → 2102.60] Seriously?
[2102.90 → 2103.18] Yeah.
[2103.38 → 2106.06] So you can look directly into red light and nothing will really happen.
[2106.78 → 2107.16] All right.
[2107.36 → 2109.22] That sounds like really dangerous advice.
[2109.74 → 2110.48] It's not good.
[2110.60 → 2114.02] It's not, like, don't, don't take a laser pointer and be like, nothing's going to happen.
[2114.02 → 2115.06] That's stupid.
[2115.30 → 2116.06] Don't do that.
[2116.96 → 2117.78] That's interesting though.
[2117.78 → 2120.06] So red light is easier on your eyes then.
[2120.40 → 2120.76] Yes.
[2121.02 → 2125.42] And when I bought my car, I was super disappointed because I had heard that blue light wasn't
[2125.42 → 2128.58] good and mine is illuminated by a blue light.
[2128.74 → 2130.10] And I was like, what are you doing?
[2130.60 → 2131.80] Why did this happen?
[2132.30 → 2132.92] That is ridiculous.
[2132.94 → 2135.34] Just put, like, red tape over all the blue lights in your car.
[2135.42 → 2135.84] Like, there.
[2136.20 → 2136.60] Done.
[2137.00 → 2141.44] But that's why, that's why if you've heard of them, there's a program for Android phones.
[2141.54 → 2142.68] I don't know if it's on iPhone or not.
[2142.68 → 2144.86] Android phones called Twilight.
[2145.12 → 2151.76] And there's a program on desktop for Windows and probably Mac as well called F. Lux or just
[2151.76 → 2152.18] Flux.
[2152.54 → 2153.36] I always say Flux.
[2153.60 → 2153.80] Yeah.
[2153.86 → 2154.20] Flux.
[2154.32 → 2154.44] Yeah.
[2154.56 → 2154.92] Both those.
[2155.04 → 2156.02] Oh, so you're aware.
[2156.18 → 2159.02] Both those programs will increase red light.
[2159.98 → 2160.52] Oh, yeah.
[2160.52 → 2161.58] I guess that is what they do, isn't it?
[2161.58 → 2161.80] Yeah.
[2162.16 → 2162.30] Yeah.
[2162.66 → 2163.26] I've heard of them.
[2163.26 → 2163.96] I've never really tried.
[2163.96 → 2164.96] They're going to, like, dim and increase red light.
[2165.22 → 2166.22] So it's easier to look at.
[2166.70 → 2167.06] Yeah.
[2167.06 → 2170.36] I just stare at really bright blue screens 24-7.
[2170.80 → 2170.86] So.
[2171.06 → 2171.28] Yeah.
[2171.78 → 2171.96] Yeah.
[2171.96 → 2172.24] You know.
[2172.50 → 2172.68] Yeah.
[2172.74 → 2173.14] Me too.
[2173.26 → 2174.98] I tried Flux.
[2175.18 → 2179.02] And then after a while, I was like, I'm just going to stay up until 6 a.m. anyway.
[2179.16 → 2179.48] Yeah.
[2179.82 → 2180.92] It's not a big difference.
[2181.18 → 2181.38] Yeah.
[2182.06 → 2182.42] Whatever.
[2182.72 → 2184.28] I know my timing is going to be way off.
[2184.32 → 2184.66] It's fine.
[2184.66 → 2189.44] This would be helpful if I actually cared about my eye health, but I don't think we have the
[2189.44 → 2192.12] luxury of that because we're on computers all the time.
[2192.22 → 2192.50] Yeah.
[2193.14 → 2197.18] And then, like, we're filming with giant light boxes like you have in the background going
[2197.18 → 2198.72] right at your face, which is God.
[2198.72 → 2199.00] Exactly.
[2199.14 → 2199.74] It does not be good.
[2200.38 → 2205.14] The horrible perils of our jobs, of sitting in our offices and sitting on computers all
[2205.14 → 2206.52] day is really terrifying.
[2206.52 → 2206.86] It's so dangerous.
[2207.14 → 2207.32] Yeah.
[2207.48 → 2207.96] Oh, my.
[2208.46 → 2208.78] Oh, me, oh, my.
[2208.78 → 2208.90] Yeah.
[2208.90 → 2209.78] You should feel bad for us.
[2209.78 → 2210.48] You should get a hazard day.
[2210.92 → 2211.48] So unhealthy.
[2211.66 → 2211.90] Yeah.
[2212.20 → 2212.94] All the time.
[2213.44 → 2214.52] Speaking of feeling bad.
[2214.66 → 2219.68] Uh, parents who don't stop children playing Call of Duty and other games of that style.
[2219.96 → 2221.48] The title's a little bit sensationalist.
[2221.54 → 2222.80] It just says, play Call of Duty.
[2223.00 → 2225.26] But, yeah, like, aggressive gameplay stuff.
[2225.36 → 2226.48] High-rated gameplay.
[2226.74 → 2228.40] Uh, will be reported to the police.
[2228.92 → 2231.10] Um, Warren's schools in the UK.
[2233.26 → 2233.70] Crazy.
[2234.56 → 2235.00] Crazy.
[2235.00 → 2235.82] Nothing about this.
[2235.82 → 2239.02] I, I like absolutely nothing about this entire story.
[2239.22 → 2239.48] Right?
[2239.74 → 2242.10] So, it's not all schools in the UK or anything.
[2242.20 → 2244.24] I believe it's, it's, it's 16 schools.
[2244.24 → 2251.70] And they've stated they would call the police and social services if children reveal in the playground that they have been playing adult-themed games.
[2252.30 → 2254.12] Several children have reported blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2254.66 → 2264.38] The games they're talking about with levels of violence and sexual content such as Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Dogs of War, and other similar games that are all inappropriate for children.
[2264.54 → 2264.70] Yeah.
[2264.70 → 2265.26] Crazy.
[2265.26 → 2265.42] Yeah.
[2265.42 → 2265.58] Crazy.
[2265.58 → 2266.46] Crazy.
[2266.76 → 2270.48] And this is, like, including everyone under 18 plus as far as I know.
[2270.48 → 2270.98] That's crazy.
[2271.30 → 2271.48] Yeah.
[2271.48 → 2274.08] Okay, I can understand maybe, like, a 6 or 7-year-old.
[2274.20 → 2276.70] Probably shouldn't be playing Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto.
[2276.70 → 2279.42] Like, if it's, like, if they're, if they're looking at elementary schools.
[2280.02 → 2280.22] Yeah.
[2280.22 → 2285.26] And if, if, like, what they do is they, like, maybe call and talk to the pyramids, uh, pyramids?
[2285.50 → 2292.38] Talk to the parents about the possible implications of letting their kids play this and be like, maybe you shouldn't, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2292.46 → 2293.84] Like, maybe that's fine.
[2294.22 → 2301.58] But once you're in high school, like, I don't know a single dude that didn't play games that were 18 plus.
[2301.58 → 2302.40] Yeah, of course.
[2302.44 → 2302.90] That's insane.
[2303.08 → 2305.40] And not only that, it's not like they're just calling.
[2305.70 → 2306.98] They're reporting to the police.
[2306.98 → 2307.34] Yes.
[2307.76 → 2308.78] As, like, an incident.
[2309.14 → 2310.62] And, and social services.
[2310.82 → 2313.00] So they can, like, that's crazy.
[2313.22 → 2322.98] This seems to me like a school district who's just trying to, like, really, like, make some news and say, oh, we're going to crap down on those video games that are killing our kids for, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2323.04 → 2327.78] It just seems kind of sensationalist, and they're just trying to, to get the, the word out.
[2327.82 → 2330.46] But this is, this is, this is messed up on a lot of levels.
[2330.46 → 2330.96] I mean.
[2332.12 → 2341.12] Parents who are also warned about their youngsters being allowed to have access to social media sites such as Facebook and WhatsApp because it can make them vulnerable to sexual grooming.
[2342.40 → 2344.60] First, I did not need to know that that was a term.
[2345.44 → 2348.48] Second of all, second of all, okay.
[2349.14 → 2353.98] Again, I can see some, like, nugget of, of, like, real information here.
[2354.06 → 2357.56] Like, yeah, you probably should have a little kid, you know, having Facebook or WhatsApp.
[2357.74 → 2358.90] Okay, I can kind of understand that.
[2358.90 → 2362.62] With the argument of, I don't want the crap that I did when I was 14 to be on the internet.
[2363.06 → 2363.38] Exactly.
[2364.00 → 2364.28] Right.
[2364.34 → 2365.22] Yeah, I just don't.
[2365.88 → 2366.86] It's just, uh, no.
[2366.90 → 2369.22] Wait, do we need to pause and do we need to discuss something right now?
[2369.22 → 2371.42] No, we super don't need to discuss anything right now at all.
[2371.46 → 2372.30] That's totally fine.
[2372.30 → 2377.28] Um, but, like, I just, just maybe have an advisory thing.
[2377.28 → 2381.76] I, yes, I think it's very ham-fisted of this school board to just come out here and do this.
[2382.00 → 2393.56] But an ulterior motive for them might be to bring this issue up and have someone go, like, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's draw back and set up a system here, which is much less aggressive.
[2393.56 → 2396.04] Um, and maybe that's actually what they want.
[2396.12 → 2397.54] I hope that's actually what they want.
[2397.72 → 2404.64] Because if someone's in elementary school and has a Facebook account and is posting everything they're doing all day on the Facebook account, maybe that's a little weird.
[2404.94 → 2405.94] That's a little scary.
[2405.94 → 2408.38] Yeah, their parents should maybe look into that.
[2408.46 → 2408.72] I don't know.
[2408.80 → 2409.48] That's their decision.
[2409.92 → 2418.18] And if a kid is playing Call of Duty, uh, they're probably getting ripped on by a bunch of old people and might even be beating them because little kids seem to be pretty good at first-person shooters.
[2418.56 → 2420.06] Yeah, that actually is something I've noticed.
[2420.22 → 2424.98] A lot of kids who are, like, somewhat younger can be incredibly good at things like Call of Duty.
[2425.24 → 2426.24] It's a little weird to me.
[2426.32 → 2428.34] Maybe they're, like, maybe it's all...
[2428.34 → 2428.84] It's like Twitch skills, man.
[2429.24 → 2429.60] Exactly.
[2430.54 → 2435.26] But, like, I just think the thing with this is that it seems ridiculous.
[2435.26 → 2436.92] Like, I get it, right?
[2436.96 → 2442.52] A lot of parents pay zero attention to the ratings of games and, you know, they'll let a little kid play, like, Grand Theft Auto, right?
[2442.60 → 2444.96] Okay, probably not a good idea.
[2445.44 → 2446.66] But I can't...
[2446.66 → 2452.72] I mean, like, little kids get to watch movies and all kinds of TV shows that are, you know, adult-themed.
[2453.20 → 2455.32] And, I mean, that's just, like, kind of normal, right?
[2455.68 → 2460.20] Like, that's not something that's completely insane and crazy, and you need to call the police and social services about.
[2460.32 → 2460.76] Yeah, yeah.
[2460.76 → 2463.88] Like, it's something that, yeah, parents probably should pay a little bit more attention to.
[2463.88 → 2469.20] But to call the police because some 15-year-old kid in school is like, oh, he's playing Call of Duty.
[2469.64 → 2470.52] Call the police!
[2470.82 → 2471.70] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[2471.70 → 2472.56] That's insane to me.
[2472.68 → 2476.66] Like, I can't even begin to imagine how they would actually enforce that.
[2476.82 → 2478.46] And what are the police going to do, right?
[2478.60 → 2482.86] You get some school calling up, like, oh, so one of our 15-year-old students was playing Call of Duty.
[2483.48 → 2483.74] Okay.
[2483.96 → 2485.92] Like, all right, we have some important stuff to do.
[2486.28 → 2486.58] Have a good day.
[2486.58 → 2487.14] Yeah, exactly.
[2487.62 → 2487.76] Yeah.
[2487.94 → 2493.62] So, I just, everything about this, everything about this just makes me sad and not.
[2494.46 → 2498.34] I'm not going to tell anyone how to raise their kids because I don't want to do that.
[2498.50 → 2503.88] But I feel like, like, if the kid wants to do it at some level, they probably will.
[2503.88 → 2505.02] Yeah, exactly.
[2505.02 → 2510.16] So, like, if you're like, oh, you can't play shooter games, he's going to go to Johnny's house and play shooter games over there.
[2510.68 → 2511.02] Mm-hmm.
[2511.02 → 2520.78] If you tell him he can't watch that movie, he's going to go on his laptop in his room or his phone or his tablet or whatever the heck, Internet of Things, and just watch it there.
[2521.04 → 2522.72] Like, I don't know.
[2522.82 → 2522.94] Yeah.
[2522.94 → 2527.74] I think having the discussion about, like, oh, it's not real.
[2527.90 → 2529.76] You probably knew this, but it's not real.
[2529.96 → 2530.90] Those are just pixels.
[2531.30 → 2532.46] It's not the same at all.
[2532.90 → 2539.16] You can be a super nice, kind-hearted person and play GTA all you want and everything can still be fine.
[2539.64 → 2540.04] Right.
[2540.36 → 2544.76] And, like, talking about the differences of, like, okay, don't kick and punch your friends in the face.
[2544.82 → 2545.20] It's cool.
[2545.68 → 2547.00] Just do that in video games.
[2547.26 → 2549.12] Don't do that, and you'll be okay.
[2549.12 → 2549.92] Yeah, I don't know.
[2549.96 → 2554.60] Just having those, like, very obvious conversations is probably not a bad idea.
[2555.22 → 2555.34] Yeah.
[2555.48 → 2557.88] Hand-fisting things will very likely just make things worse.
[2558.08 → 2565.10] I just tell you, this just seems to me like every year or two, some things got to, like, there's got to be some controversy or something.
[2565.18 → 2566.04] Oh, God, video games.
[2566.16 → 2567.16] They're terrible for people.
[2567.20 → 2569.84] And then everyone calms down, everyone forgets about it, and it's no big deal.
[2569.90 → 2577.20] I feel like this is just another one of those things where some school district is wanting to make some attention, make some news, and, you know, it's going to blow over and whatever.
[2577.20 → 2591.02] But it just annoys me that video games are still ragged on like this when, I mean, there's so much advantage to playing video games as far as, like, just, you know, being able to, like, get friends and be able to, like, everyone, like, come and hang out and play Mario Kart or GTA.
[2591.40 → 2592.20] Mario Kart's the best.
[2592.32 → 2592.56] Or whatever.
[2594.88 → 2597.30] It's held one of my friend groups together completely.
[2597.64 → 2601.98] That's completely the reason why it has is that we'll all come together and play games or play games on the Internet.
[2601.98 → 2612.64] I find it's a perfect way to keep in contact with friends that I had in high school and stuff because even if they moved away, or I moved away or whatever, you can still play online, which is a perfect way to, yeah.
[2613.10 → 2618.54] So the third thing we've learned this show, pizza's great, we love Linus, and you should play more video games.
[2618.58 → 2618.82] Yes.
[2619.14 → 2619.48] Success.
[2619.62 → 2620.20] All right, next.
[2620.88 → 2623.82] Moving on to a more uplifting story.
[2623.92 → 2625.84] I think this is freaking amazing.
[2625.98 → 2627.20] I'm a huge fan of this product.
[2627.20 → 2630.10] It is called Volvo Life Paint.
[2630.72 → 2631.54] Which is a great name.
[2631.98 → 2632.44] Life Paint?
[2632.62 → 2633.48] Yeah, it's fantastic.
[2634.00 → 2637.98] So to, it's invisible in, like, daylight.
[2638.32 → 2640.42] So if there's a lot of light on the object, it's not visible.
[2640.72 → 2644.66] But if there's not much light on the object, as far as I can tell, it glows white?
[2645.50 → 2646.12] Yeah, yeah.
[2646.12 → 2646.98] I think it's a white glow.
[2647.14 → 2649.16] I'm going to share my screen here for a second.
[2649.92 → 2654.44] So what it does is it shines brightly and with, like, the glare.
[2654.44 → 2659.80] It's kind of like a reflective sort of thing where, like, if you're driving around the corner and, you know, it's like headlights hit, it'll bounce back.
[2659.86 → 2661.06] Like, I can't tell you how many times.
[2661.36 → 2662.32] I can't tell you.
[2662.42 → 2663.12] It's not been that many times.
[2663.14 → 2665.76] But it's happened to me before where I'm driving through a neighbourhood.
[2666.18 → 2666.92] I'll come around the corner.
[2667.02 → 2667.90] It's in the middle of the night.
[2667.94 → 2670.06] And someone's walking around with, like, a black hoodie on.
[2670.44 → 2671.44] Like, in the middle of the street.
[2671.50 → 2672.66] Like, don't do that.
[2672.68 → 2673.98] That's a bad idea, right?
[2674.02 → 2674.14] Yeah.
[2674.14 → 2682.98] But if I have some, like, stupid, you know, reflective thing where I'm driving around, and I see someone shiny with this life paint, then I might not hit them because that would be bad.
[2683.34 → 2683.48] Yeah.
[2683.48 → 2687.24] So it's supposed to be reflective stuff that is kind of held together, which is very cool.
[2687.58 → 2689.82] And, yeah, reflective was the best term for it.
[2690.58 → 2693.82] I think it's great, especially because of exactly what you just said.
[2693.86 → 2697.72] I've been a biker, or I was a biker for many years when I was going to university.
[2698.04 → 2698.68] That sounds badass.
[2698.78 → 2699.68] Just throwing that out there.
[2700.38 → 2700.56] What?
[2700.92 → 2701.58] A biker?
[2701.68 → 2702.70] I didn't mean motorbike.
[2703.18 → 2703.94] I was, like, a pedal bike person.
[2703.94 → 2704.28] Oh, never mind.
[2704.38 → 2705.08] I take it back.
[2705.18 → 2706.22] I take all those cool points.
[2706.38 → 2707.42] And you just lost a few.
[2707.42 → 2707.84] I did.
[2707.92 → 2712.86] I was, like, that kid in Pokémon who, like, got the bike voucher and was, like, yeah, I'm going to go to school.
[2712.86 → 2715.28] I can save my one million credits now.
[2715.36 → 2715.54] Yeah.
[2716.44 → 2716.84] Exactly.
[2717.38 → 2717.60] Yeah.
[2717.80 → 2719.42] That money I would have never made.
[2719.68 → 2720.90] I wonder if someone saved up enough.
[2721.14 → 2721.70] No, dude.
[2721.74 → 2724.08] The cap was, like, $999,000, right?
[2724.10 → 2724.84] Oh, so you couldn't get it?
[2724.90 → 2725.18] Yeah.
[2725.20 → 2726.02] I don't think you could have.
[2726.26 → 2726.58] Yeah.
[2726.80 → 2727.62] I think that's the whole point.
[2728.24 → 2729.10] That makes sense.
[2729.48 → 2730.08] I kind of want to try it.
[2730.20 → 2730.80] I'm pretty sure.
[2731.00 → 2731.22] Yeah.
[2731.36 → 2731.48] Yeah.
[2731.58 → 2731.76] Yeah.
[2734.00 → 2734.84] Epic references.
[2734.84 → 2738.00] But, yeah, like, this would have been really nice while I was doing that.
[2738.14 → 2746.80] And I think the other unintended fantastic part about this is you can spray things, and then they won't show up in daylight, and they'll show up later on.
[2746.96 → 2754.12] So you can, like, spray explicit things, which are funny, but people spray on stuff that look like elongated something's.
[2754.36 → 2757.34] And you can leave them wherever the heck you want and people won't even know.
[2757.42 → 2758.24] And that's fantastic.
[2758.90 → 2759.84] Now you could.
[2760.32 → 2761.72] It washes off after a week.
[2762.04 → 2763.70] So it even disappears after a while.
[2763.84 → 2765.02] It's literally perfect.
[2765.22 → 2765.66] It's perfect.
[2765.76 → 2769.78] It'll save lives, and you get to paint things on things.
[2769.78 → 2772.78] And you'll be able to see things in certain light.
[2773.22 → 2773.36] Yeah.
[2773.80 → 2775.66] So, like, Buddy passes out at the party.
[2776.16 → 2777.26] They turn the lights off.
[2777.44 → 2778.54] Sprays some stuff on him.
[2778.60 → 2779.10] No big deal.
[2779.18 → 2780.00] He can go to work.
[2780.22 → 2780.92] It's fine.
[2781.12 → 2782.10] It can be on his face.
[2782.20 → 2783.94] And he can still go to work and everything will be fine.
[2784.26 → 2787.50] And then you turn the lights off and then he gets home.
[2787.50 → 2789.02] It's been a long day at work.
[2789.36 → 2790.76] His wife is there.
[2790.82 → 2791.42] She's like, how are you doing?
[2791.50 → 2792.04] I need to be fine.
[2792.12 → 2792.34] Whatever.
[2792.44 → 2793.26] Just turns the light off.
[2793.54 → 2794.72] Giant penis on his face.
[2795.30 → 2796.20] Just whatever.
[2796.48 → 2796.90] I don't know.
[2796.98 → 2797.70] It could be hilarious.
[2798.02 → 2804.28] This might be the greatest invention of all humanity that saves lives, makes perfect pranks possible.
[2804.58 → 2806.08] Volvo, we salute you.
[2806.28 → 2806.72] I salute you.
[2806.80 → 2807.64] I feel like we both do.
[2807.76 → 2808.18] I think it's great.
[2808.26 → 2808.84] I don't speak for you.
[2809.34 → 2810.50] No, I salute them too.
[2810.60 → 2811.40] That's fantastic.
[2811.64 → 2812.32] I completely agree.
[2812.66 → 2817.16] And what I really like about it too is, isn't Volvo the one that came up with the three-point seatbelt?
[2817.74 → 2818.06] Yes.
[2818.32 → 2819.42] And they opened up that patent?
[2819.82 → 2820.18] Exactly.
[2820.36 → 2820.44] Yeah.
[2820.62 → 2820.96] For like everybody?
[2821.42 → 2825.72] It was like, I don't want to, again, I think this whole show has been me getting-
[2825.72 → 2827.22] Say something, and they'd be like, uh.
[2827.66 → 2829.24] It was a while ago, right?
[2829.36 → 2829.62] Yeah.
[2829.74 → 2830.78] Like 60, 70, something like that.
[2830.84 → 2830.92] Yeah.
[2830.92 → 2832.80] I think they patented it, and they just gave the patent.
[2832.92 → 2836.10] They gave like a free license to other automotive manufacturers.
[2836.10 → 2837.10] We want people to be safer.
[2837.70 → 2839.32] I think this is like wave two.
[2840.26 → 2840.40] Yeah.
[2840.40 → 2841.32] Of that whole idea.
[2841.44 → 2849.00] I don't know if they're going to release the patent or do whatever, but I think it's very cool that they're putting a lot of effort to save people that aren't even directly in their market.
[2849.72 → 2849.86] Right.
[2849.86 → 2851.24] It's just people riding bikes.
[2851.76 → 2851.94] Yeah.
[2852.06 → 2852.64] It's not-
[2852.64 → 2853.20] Not cars.
[2853.20 → 2854.44] Yeah, exactly.
[2854.60 → 2857.56] Like if you're riding a bike, you might not own a Volvo, right?
[2857.86 → 2861.98] But they're still the ones who are, I'm assuming, who designed this and are selling it and all that kind of stuff.
[2862.08 → 2863.64] So yeah, big props to Volvo.
[2863.78 → 2865.78] This is something awesome all the way around.
[2866.20 → 2866.44] Yeah.
[2866.64 → 2867.84] I thought that was absolutely cool.
[2867.96 → 2868.78] I loved that.
[2868.86 → 2871.54] That was probably my favourite thing in the dock so far.
[2871.54 → 2875.26] Have they actually said, is it available or like, can you buy this yet?
[2875.76 → 2878.60] I didn't see anything in terms of being able to purchase it.
[2878.60 → 2883.88] There's a, I know you can get involved, whatever that actually means, by submitting your email address.
[2884.36 → 2887.32] Um, ooh, it does look like you can buy it, actually.
[2887.52 → 2887.86] Now let me see.
[2887.92 → 2890.84] It says, get Life Paint at the shops below, and they're all in London.
[2892.00 → 2893.64] Uh-huh.
[2894.30 → 2896.24] I don't see anywhere to actually order it.
[2896.24 → 2900.92] I feel like a channel Superfan video is about to become a reality.
[2901.82 → 2904.08] If I can get my hands on some of this, this will definitely-
[2904.08 → 2904.80] Can you order it?
[2905.20 → 2906.06] I don't think so.
[2906.06 → 2907.32] Or is it like you have to actually pick it up in person?
[2907.62 → 2912.10] Yeah, they said at the shops below and there was like a gray and white, I'm going to see here.
[2913.20 → 2919.90] Elton & Co., Cadence Performance Limited, Athlete Lab, The Veto House, Bespoke Cycling, Fully Charged Glove House.
[2919.90 → 2924.44] Oh yeah, Volvo is into a actually now that I think about it, Volvo is into a lot of stuff that's not cars, right?
[2924.48 → 2927.44] Like they do all kinds of other, like bikes and whatnot, right?
[2927.60 → 2928.70] Oh, do they?
[2929.36 → 2931.00] Oh, I thought that's what you were reading on their site.
[2931.52 → 2933.56] No, those are stores where you can buy it.
[2934.22 → 2935.38] Oh, okay, never mind.
[2935.50 → 2937.10] I was wrong again.
[2937.10 → 2940.44] I don't know.
[2940.52 → 2941.04] They might be.
[2941.14 → 2942.82] I don't know much about that.
[2943.40 → 2944.36] I don't see it on their site.
[2944.44 → 2945.50] I'll see if I can order some.
[2945.60 → 2947.56] That would actually, I would love to do a video on this stuff.
[2947.58 → 2948.44] That would be so cool.
[2948.56 → 2949.60] That would be so cool.
[2949.86 → 2952.50] And of course, I'd have to spray some stuff all over Linus.
[2952.70 → 2955.22] Like if I can get a hold of Linus' like NVIDIA jacket.
[2955.42 → 2956.38] Wait, shh!
[2956.48 → 2957.16] And then-
[2957.16 → 2958.50] After the show, after the show.
[2958.96 → 2959.68] I'll hold it.
[2959.76 → 2960.16] I'll hold it.
[2960.18 → 2960.80] I won't go anymore.
[2960.80 → 2962.12] Moving on.
[2963.64 → 2964.64] Finding other topic.
[2964.76 → 2966.10] I have to do sponsor-sponsor real quick.
[2966.22 → 2966.76] Give me a moment.
[2967.18 → 2967.52] Go for it.
[2969.52 → 2971.14] If, if, Nick set them up.
[2971.14 → 2972.68] Do you have like some awesome sponsor music yet?
[2973.18 → 2975.00] I don't have sponsor music.
[2975.46 → 2976.68] I wish I had sponsor music.
[2976.94 → 2978.18] You can be the sponsor music.
[2978.44 → 2981.18] We want to tell you about our new show sponsor, FreshBooks.
[2981.30 → 2987.88] They're a pretty cool online tool that can help you get your accounting done and just do things quickly.
[2988.00 → 2990.52] It's great for small businesses or some freelance work.
[2990.58 → 2991.90] I've done freelance work in the past.
[2992.00 → 2995.84] Doing computer repairs, office setups, all that kind of stuff for techie, techie style things.
[2996.16 → 2998.04] You can have your clients pay online.
[2998.16 → 2999.12] You can manage your expenses.
[2999.68 → 3004.52] You can set up invoices and stuff like that and have everything automatically tracked, which is absolutely fantastic.
[3004.52 → 3010.90] You can use it to update your timesheet through your phone and do projects on basically any connected device that you have.
[3011.18 → 3016.78] Head over to freshbooks.com slash WAN and don't forget to enter WAN in how did you hear about us section as well.
[3017.04 → 3017.80] Moving onwards.
[3018.06 → 3018.98] I have facial hair.
[3020.00 → 3020.44] Congratulations.
[3020.82 → 3021.64] Austin does not have facial hair.
[3021.94 → 3023.50] It's possible that you have facial hair.
[3023.70 → 3025.52] It's possible that you have hair elsewhere.
[3025.76 → 3026.62] You probably do.
[3027.10 → 3030.36] And Dollar Shave Club isn't only for men.
[3030.36 → 3036.36] I know it's marketed that way often, but as we've discussed on the show before, your lady friends could use it just as well as you could.
[3036.64 → 3038.04] So please take note of that.
[3039.54 → 3040.92] DollarShaveClub.com slash Linus.
[3041.06 → 3041.46] Linus.
[3041.60 → 3043.18] I can talk at all sometimes.
[3044.22 → 3045.04] Shave Time, Shave Money.
[3045.16 → 3048.36] They have their Dr. Carver's Shave Butter.
[3049.40 → 3049.56] Wow.
[3049.56 → 3050.82] Which is awesome, by the way.
[3050.82 → 3050.98] I'm having a problem talking right now.
[3050.98 → 3051.54] I've tried it.
[3051.64 → 3052.72] It is really, really cool.
[3052.74 → 3053.64] I actually do like it too.
[3053.70 → 3054.88] I actually do use that every day.
[3054.96 → 3056.88] That isn't even part of the sponsor spot thing.
[3056.88 → 3062.08] But I use Dr. Carver's Cave Butter and Dr. Carver's Shave Butter.
[3062.54 → 3063.38] Oh my god.
[3063.44 → 3064.56] What's wrong with me right now?
[3065.28 → 3066.88] And I use their razor as well.
[3067.42 → 3069.56] It's a great way to have razors show up to your door.
[3069.70 → 3073.00] And it costs a lot less than most razors that you can buy in the store as well.
[3073.14 → 3073.92] Which is pretty cool.
[3074.66 → 3074.84] Alright.
[3075.78 → 3077.54] Back to the normal show.
[3077.76 → 3079.00] You magically appear again.
[3081.30 → 3082.46] Why is Nick calling?
[3083.14 → 3083.50] Uh oh.
[3084.08 → 3084.92] Audio problems again?
[3085.06 → 3085.36] What?
[3085.36 → 3089.24] You need to change the lower clearing when you need a different sponsor.
[3092.72 → 3095.78] Clicking on Dollar Shave Club versus FreshBooks.
[3096.28 → 3096.82] My bad.
[3097.74 → 3098.32] That sucked.
[3098.96 → 3099.40] Sorry, Nick.
[3100.14 → 3100.72] That's okay.
[3100.88 → 3101.06] Bye.
[3101.24 → 3101.58] Bye.
[3102.80 → 3103.42] Poor Nick.
[3103.68 → 3104.94] We have to have Nick around.
[3105.08 → 3108.06] Otherwise, literally nothing goes correct at all.
[3108.34 → 3108.98] Nick is like...
[3108.98 → 3110.98] Nick is going to hate this because he's watching right now.
[3111.04 → 3112.34] But Nick is like the office mom.
[3113.14 → 3114.98] Like he'll make sure everyone's like doing okay.
[3114.98 → 3117.54] Like if people are working, and they're like, oh man, I have so much to do today.
[3117.60 → 3118.80] He'll be like, are you fed?
[3118.96 → 3119.42] Do you have lunch?
[3119.74 → 3120.18] Do you need food?
[3120.44 → 3121.02] I'll get you food.
[3121.20 → 3121.62] Do you need food?
[3121.74 → 3123.44] And then he'll like to go out and get people food and everything.
[3123.84 → 3124.34] It's fantastic.
[3124.82 → 3125.62] He emailed me.
[3125.70 → 3127.06] I think it was on Wednesday.
[3127.38 → 3127.98] He's like, hey dude.
[3128.04 → 3129.22] This is like super late.
[3129.44 → 3130.30] But can you be on the WAN show?
[3130.34 → 3132.44] And like he sent this like really long, thoughtful email.
[3132.60 → 3134.30] It's like, dude, congratulations on your channel.
[3134.68 → 3135.96] You know, I think it would be awesome.
[3135.96 → 3138.66] You know, you guys can make an awesome show.
[3138.98 → 3139.60] And I was like, yeah, sure.
[3139.64 → 3140.00] No problem.
[3140.26 → 3141.54] And I was like, that was my entire response.
[3141.62 → 3142.16] I felt bad.
[3142.22 → 3145.56] I was like, man, he probably spent like a long time working on his email asking if I would
[3145.56 → 3146.22] want to be on the show.
[3146.28 → 3146.98] I was like, yeah, sure.
[3147.36 → 3150.38] And it shows the differences too because yeah, giant blog.
[3150.50 → 3151.82] You're like, yeah, of course, dude.
[3151.86 → 3152.96] And then I'm like, sweet.
[3154.54 → 3155.16] Yeah, exactly.
[3155.30 → 3156.88] It's like the longest email to it ever.
[3157.14 → 3157.40] Sure.
[3157.62 → 3157.90] Okay.
[3159.18 → 3159.86] That was great.
[3159.92 → 3161.30] Thank you, by the way, for showing it.
[3161.30 → 3165.68] But yeah, that, yeah.
[3166.12 → 3166.90] Shout out to Nick.
[3167.52 → 3168.26] Nick is awesome.
[3168.46 → 3169.08] He's very helpful.
[3170.20 → 3171.54] Things that aren't awesome.
[3171.84 → 3173.00] Changing topics a little bit.
[3173.44 → 3179.22] Two former federal agents are charged with stealing a whack ton of Bitcoin during the Silk
[3179.22 → 3179.58] Road.
[3180.36 → 3181.62] What would you even call that?
[3181.74 → 3182.14] Pillage?
[3182.78 → 3184.72] When they just like wrecked Silk Road.
[3185.62 → 3186.06] Yeah.
[3186.56 → 3187.16] So that was crazy.
[3187.16 → 3190.88] So if I remember the story right, and I'll probably be wrong again, even though I have some
[3190.88 → 3191.50] awesome notes.
[3191.50 → 3191.72] Whatever, man.
[3192.18 → 3195.68] Basically, Silk Road was, it was around for a while.
[3195.94 → 3198.44] And actually, this happened a what, maybe a year or two ago?
[3199.48 → 3200.26] Oh, yeah, for sure.
[3200.52 → 3203.94] There's been, there's, there's been, Silk Road 1, I think, was quite a while ago.
[3203.98 → 3205.74] And there's been some kind of like pop-ups and stuff.
[3205.82 → 3210.14] But I think they've, the more recent ones have actually been from a different group just
[3210.14 → 3213.16] trying to kind of ride on the, on the name thing.
[3213.16 → 3213.42] Yeah.
[3213.84 → 3217.86] Because they arrested the guy behind, I guess, this particular Silk Road.
[3217.98 → 3219.00] Yeah, Dread Pirate Roberts.
[3219.00 → 3219.20] Dread Pirate Roberts.
[3219.58 → 3221.02] That's the greatest name ever.
[3221.20 → 3221.82] Just throwing that out there.
[3221.94 → 3222.90] If I'm going to be a criminal.
[3222.90 → 3224.08] Well, it's Ross Albright, I think.
[3224.54 → 3224.98] Shh.
[3225.26 → 3226.74] Dread Pirate Roberts sounds way cooler.
[3226.74 → 3230.02] Like, if I'm going to be a criminal, I need a cool name like Dread Pirate Roberts.
[3230.04 → 3231.00] Just legally change it.
[3231.06 → 3232.04] Yeah, my first name's Dread.
[3232.16 → 3233.06] Middle name's Pirate.
[3233.12 → 3233.86] Last name Roberts.
[3234.14 → 3234.56] No, we can do it.
[3235.48 → 3236.16] But, yeah.
[3236.20 → 3240.44] So basically what happened was, was that the US government, they became owners of a huge
[3240.44 → 3244.76] trove of Bitcoin because they seized the assets of Dread Pirate Roberts.
[3244.76 → 3247.00] I feel like an eye patch to say that properly.
[3247.00 → 3247.78] Yeah.
[3247.90 → 3252.34] But then now two of the former agents of the DEA and the Secret Service who were actually
[3252.34 → 3256.86] doing the investigation, they decided, eh, we can keep a few of these Bitcoins, right?
[3257.08 → 3258.44] You know, no one's going to notice.
[3258.60 → 3260.56] I mean, it's internet money, right?
[3260.96 → 3264.12] Except it was worth like 1.1 million dollars.
[3264.12 → 3269.28] And I think a couple of people might have perhaps noticed, and now they've been charged with stealing.
[3269.72 → 3271.22] Actually, what are all the charges here?
[3271.22 → 3274.74] They've been charged with money laundering, wire fraud, and other various offences.
[3274.94 → 3277.82] So, like, not small-time stuff at all.
[3278.08 → 3284.16] And it might cause some issues, too, because Dread Pirate Roberts made some agreements with these guys,
[3284.40 → 3292.42] like right here, where he allegedly paid them around $100,000 to keep certain things about Silk Road under wraps.
[3292.42 → 3298.72] They told them that they had more information, and they could not forward that information to their obvious employers if he paid them.
[3298.72 → 3299.76] And he actually did.
[3300.20 → 3305.10] And now that's complicating the case a little bit, which, oh, jeez.
[3305.32 → 3310.12] I mean, that's going to be a huge blow to the case because if you're having some of the guys who were starting the investigation
[3310.12 → 3316.54] who were working with the government at the time, if they were stealing, they were, like, involved in this whole deal.
[3316.70 → 3319.50] I mean, I feel like that's got to be a huge blow to the entire thing.
[3319.68 → 3320.04] It is.
[3320.22 → 3322.40] Yeah, that could seriously injure the integrity.
[3322.42 → 3323.48] of the entire case.
[3323.54 → 3324.48] That's crazy.
[3324.54 → 3329.44] This seems like, if you just replace Bitcoin with, I don't know, like, drugs or money or something,
[3329.64 → 3331.88] this could totally be, like, an awesome 70s cop episode.
[3332.22 → 3338.06] But instead, it's just like, actually, it could be a slightly less awesome, like, I don't know, Law & Order episode.
[3338.78 → 3343.02] But it's just everything about this seems ridiculous, especially Dread Pirate Roberts.
[3343.10 → 3344.00] That's the most ridiculous.
[3344.40 → 3345.34] I love that.
[3345.54 → 3345.70] But, yeah.
[3345.70 → 3346.54] That's so good.
[3346.54 → 3346.72] But, yeah.
[3346.72 → 3350.44] These guys stealing, like, a million dollars worth of Bitcoin, probably not the greatest idea.
[3351.38 → 3353.28] Why is my computer making noise?
[3353.74 → 3356.00] Auto-playing videos on websites suck other than YouTube.
[3356.00 → 3356.90] Oh, I hate that.
[3357.12 → 3357.42] I hate that.
[3357.44 → 3358.10] So frustrating.
[3358.30 → 3359.68] I would hope YouTube autoplayed.
[3359.68 → 3360.82] That would be a little annoying if it didn't.
[3362.24 → 3362.56] Yeah.
[3363.20 → 3363.94] So these two...
[3363.94 → 3365.30] I have to manually press the play button every time.
[3365.88 → 3366.16] But, yeah.
[3366.16 → 3370.60] These two brilliant guys didn't get too far with their million dollars in Bitcoin.
[3370.74 → 3375.04] In fact, if you steal a million dollars in Bitcoin, like, that would kind of be harder
[3375.04 → 3376.12] to spend, right?
[3376.24 → 3379.44] Like, I can't imagine that's as easy as just having a million dollars in cash.
[3379.52 → 3382.98] For these guys, especially who have just been investigating it, like, what are you actually
[3382.98 → 3384.40] going to do with that kind of money of Bitcoin?
[3384.40 → 3388.74] It would probably be harder to spend in order of, like, things that you would easily be able
[3388.74 → 3389.14] to buy.
[3389.32 → 3396.52] But it would probably actually be easier due to being untraceable or not very traceable.
[3396.68 → 3401.32] I just wonder if these Bitcoins were just never reported in the original, like, seized.
[3401.50 → 3405.54] Like, when the government seized, like, these Bitcoins, or if they were, like, already known.
[3405.74 → 3406.56] I don't know.
[3406.58 → 3410.06] I'm not, like, a super expert on Bitcoin, as you might have been able to guess.
[3410.52 → 3411.78] But, I don't know.
[3411.78 → 3416.58] I think it just doesn't seem like a particularly great idea just anywhere along this particular
[3416.58 → 3416.98] chain.
[3417.14 → 3417.64] So, I don't know.
[3417.80 → 3418.68] It's weird.
[3418.94 → 3419.52] The blockchain.
[3420.36 → 3420.72] Yeah.
[3421.00 → 3427.18] I feel like you'd be able to more easily move stolen money if it was in Bitcoins than
[3427.18 → 3430.14] in dollars, because dollars are a little bit easier to track, especially on the internet.
[3432.44 → 3435.42] So, if they were trying to, like, launder it through other things, that would probably
[3435.42 → 3436.54] be not that bad of a process.
[3436.90 → 3441.26] But getting it out of whoever was managing this at the beginning.
[3441.26 → 3442.84] I don't know about that process.
[3442.94 → 3443.86] I have no idea what they did.
[3444.06 → 3446.34] And I feel like there would have to be some sort of transaction record.
[3446.46 → 3448.80] Like, they must have been paying attention, which is probably how they found them.
[3449.08 → 3449.64] They got caught.
[3449.80 → 3449.96] Yeah.
[3450.64 → 3453.56] Something along this happy little blockchain got messed up.
[3453.96 → 3454.04] Yeah.
[3455.04 → 3455.52] I don't know.
[3456.24 → 3457.06] That's crazy, though.
[3457.20 → 3459.84] This whole thing is, like, shaping up to just be, like, this odd.
[3459.84 → 3462.92] Like, it's, like, getting close to being a movie, I think.
[3463.04 → 3465.26] Like, it just needs, like, a couple of extra little twists.
[3465.48 → 3466.92] I think this totally could be a good movie.
[3467.18 → 3468.32] Well, it could be a movie.
[3468.40 → 3469.40] I don't know how to say it's good.
[3469.58 → 3469.94] Probably.
[3470.48 → 3474.48] Most of this kind of, like, Bitcoin hacker movies are not very good.
[3474.68 → 3476.18] But I might watch it.
[3476.40 → 3476.62] Yeah.
[3476.62 → 3478.52] I like Hackers, the movie.
[3478.98 → 3480.28] I thought that movie was fantastic.
[3480.80 → 3481.10] Yeah.
[3481.32 → 3482.20] But you're right.
[3482.98 → 3486.60] Anyway, moving to a completely different topic.
[3486.74 → 3487.76] April Fool's happened.
[3488.48 → 3488.74] It did.
[3488.74 → 3492.96] And, of course, tons of giant tech companies did a bunch of different April Fool's things.
[3493.20 → 3494.06] What were some of your favourites?
[3494.96 → 3495.44] Oh, man.
[3495.48 → 3498.80] You know, this year I feel like it was one of the first April Fool's.
[3498.80 → 3500.14] I was just kind of over it.
[3500.38 → 3502.66] Like, I liked the Motorola, the selfie stick.
[3502.66 → 3507.76] I think that was probably my favourite because that one, it just was, it was, like, it was a good parody of Apple.
[3507.96 → 3517.56] And it was a good parody of just, like, this, if you guys haven't seen it, it's this great video where, you know, these, like, these artisans are making, like, crafting, like, the ultimate selfie stick out of, like, leather and wood.
[3517.82 → 3518.98] And, like, they're taking selfies.
[3519.10 → 3520.26] It's a good video.
[3520.38 → 3523.28] Like, as far as the April Fool's Day stuff went, it was good.
[3523.54 → 3526.70] I also liked the com. Google where everything was backwards.
[3526.98 → 3527.48] That was cool.
[3527.74 → 3527.84] Yeah.
[3528.56 → 3529.36] What did you like?
[3529.36 → 3535.22] Uh, I, I like, uh, I'm a little bit over it on some things with April Fool's stuff.
[3535.40 → 3538.32] I do like the high production quality video kind of stuff.
[3538.32 → 3538.58] Yeah.
[3538.70 → 3539.84] Because I find it entertaining.
[3540.04 → 3546.04] So, like, I liked some of the, the Google ones where they were, like, oh, uh, what, like, fibre.
[3546.54 → 3548.28] When they're, like, oh, yeah, DSL mode.
[3548.42 → 3550.72] Because, like, it's, huh.
[3551.22 → 3556.78] It was just realistic enough and the production quality was there that I was, like, this is just awesome.
[3556.78 → 3558.20] Because it's comedy at that point.
[3558.20 → 3560.66] And, like, Racer with their levitating mouse.
[3561.20 → 3562.60] I was like, what?
[3563.40 → 3564.36] That's so cool.
[3564.62 → 3566.00] Or Corsair with the ball mouse.
[3566.12 → 3567.80] Like, I love how they both did mice.
[3567.94 → 3570.60] But, like, I, I like the high production quality stuff.
[3570.98 → 3576.28] But, the forum voted in, um, Google, Microsoft, Corsair, Asus, and Racer.
[3576.46 → 3582.44] So, all of the like, most expected companies for people to vote for because they're popular.
[3582.88 → 3583.12] Um.
[3584.20 → 3585.16] For no other reason.
[3585.16 → 3586.12] Because we had a little voting poll on the forum.
[3586.24 → 3587.36] Yeah, I, I don't know.
[3587.36 → 3592.20] I, I wasn't a huge fan of the Asus one.
[3592.32 → 3594.82] But that's probably largely just because there wasn't a video.
[3595.04 → 3597.16] That was the, the station thing, right?
[3597.60 → 3598.42] Where they're making fun of consoles?
[3598.42 → 3601.46] There was station and I think there was something else.
[3601.56 → 3603.44] But, yeah, station was definitely one of them.
[3603.92 → 3605.64] That one, I didn't even think that was real.
[3605.74 → 3607.92] Like, I, I didn't even think it was a real April Fool's joke.
[3607.96 → 3610.90] I thought it was just, like, someone, like, r slash PC mastermind made it.
[3610.98 → 3611.46] And I was like, oh, wait.
[3611.52 → 3612.22] This is actually real.
[3612.50 → 3612.66] Oh.
[3612.66 → 3613.06] Right.
[3613.06 → 3613.98] That's kind of cool.
[3614.00 → 3620.06] They had the DOG Neptune, um, which is, like, an LN2 cooled graphics card that you can just buy.
[3620.76 → 3621.12] Um.
[3621.38 → 3627.38] But then, yeah, that, that's, like, my problem with that is the graphic of the actual Neptune looks really cool.
[3627.46 → 3630.86] And then the surrounding text is, like, like, borderline meme text.
[3630.86 → 3631.50] Mm.
[3631.50 → 3632.48] It's like, all right.
[3633.80 → 3634.12] Yeah.
[3634.28 → 3634.74] I, I don't know.
[3634.80 → 3637.62] I, I like it when people put a lot of effort into it, essentially.
[3637.72 → 3637.90] Yeah.
[3638.00 → 3639.22] That's the April Fool's joke.
[3639.40 → 3641.78] I like the ones that aren't mean and that aren't stupid, right?
[3641.78 → 3648.76] Like, a lot of them, like, the I saw a bunch of people were posting the NVIDIA just bought Valve, and they're gonna push out Half-Life 3.
[3648.98 → 3649.18] Yeah.
[3649.18 → 3650.54] It's like, dudes, just no.
[3650.68 → 3651.20] Stop it.
[3651.38 → 3651.56] Yeah.
[3652.30 → 3653.00] Just, that's not funny.
[3653.04 → 3653.50] That's not cool.
[3653.54 → 3654.64] It's just, that's just annoying.
[3654.90 → 3655.26] Yes.
[3655.56 → 3655.72] Yeah.
[3655.72 → 3658.92] There are a lot of the ones, and especially, I think the thing that really bothers me most is, like,
[3658.92 → 3667.88] when companies kind of, like, they half-ass it, they're like, ah, we'll, like, make some clever, witty thing that's, like, obviously dumb and, like, it's not even, it's not even funny.
[3667.88 → 3668.02] Yes.
[3668.38 → 3668.54] Yeah.
[3668.62 → 3672.92] Like, a lot of those bother me because you can just see, like, some, like, marketing department, they're like, you know what?
[3672.98 → 3673.74] This will be funny.
[3673.82 → 3675.00] We'll do April Fool's.
[3675.14 → 3675.26] Yeah.
[3675.26 → 3678.24] Let's come up with a terrible idea and no one will like it.
[3678.28 → 3679.40] Like, I just see that.
[3680.12 → 3680.74] Yeah, exactly.
[3680.86 → 3682.04] It's just like, guys, come on.
[3682.10 → 3684.40] If you're going to do it, at least do it right.
[3684.46 → 3686.32] If not, just please don't.
[3686.32 → 3691.76] That's what I said, I like the high production quality video kind of stuff because then it's, like, it's a proper experience.
[3692.34 → 3693.12] And you're like, you know what?
[3693.18 → 3695.12] That was, that was funny and that was cool.
[3695.30 → 3696.96] Like, even PlayStation Flow.
[3697.34 → 3700.58] Like, I knew people wouldn't vote for it because it's our forum, which, that's fine.
[3701.32 → 3703.26] But, like, that was a perfect video.
[3703.48 → 3704.26] And that was hilarious.
[3704.36 → 3705.08] Did you see that one?
[3705.60 → 3706.08] No, I didn't.
[3706.08 → 3714.68] Okay, so it's, it's supposed to be, like, kind of like VR, but you only wear it for, uh, underwater sections in video games.
[3715.36 → 3715.46] What?
[3715.46 → 3717.10] And you, like, go dive in a pool.
[3717.26 → 3719.08] And it's supposed to be, like, realism and stuff.
[3719.30 → 3719.90] It's great.
[3719.98 → 3725.78] And she's like, yeah, even if you don't, my favourite part was when she's like, yeah, even if you don't have a pool, you can still experience flow.
[3725.78 → 3728.44] And then they show someone, like, fake swimming in a bathtub.
[3728.92 → 3731.00] They show another dude fake swimming in a ball pit.
[3731.32 → 3736.56] And then someone else just, like, laying on a footrest thing, like, swimming in their family room in the air.
[3736.90 → 3738.76] I'm like, this is so great.
[3739.70 → 3740.58] Oh, it was hilarious.
[3740.60 → 3741.28] That sounds funny.
[3741.32 → 3742.34] I don't even need to watch that.
[3742.40 → 3743.40] That just sounds funny.
[3743.54 → 3743.74] Yeah.
[3743.90 → 3745.18] I'll give, I'll give Sony props on that.
[3745.26 → 3746.02] That's, that's pretty good.
[3746.70 → 3747.44] I, I don't know.
[3747.48 → 3748.14] I thought that was interesting.
[3748.24 → 3749.92] And, like, they obviously put a lot of effort into it.
[3749.98 → 3750.72] And, like, you know what?
[3750.72 → 3755.74] If they get some more publicity because of that, if they pushed really hard and made something really cool and hilarious,
[3755.92 → 3756.40] that's fine.
[3756.62 → 3756.94] I'm cool with that.
[3756.94 → 3757.60] Yeah, totally.
[3757.82 → 3758.30] Yeah, absolutely.
[3759.32 → 3760.26] Anyway, moving on.
[3760.34 → 3763.86] Speaking of, uh, I, I segued that entire topic.
[3763.98 → 3767.26] The reason why I brought April Fool's up entirely was to segue into this.
[3767.74 → 3770.26] Um, which is Hyperkin's Smart Boy.
[3771.12 → 3771.32] Yeah!
[3771.32 → 3772.52] Which was leaked on Reddit.
[3772.92 → 3775.42] And, uh, it, I don't know.
[3775.42 → 3778.24] It was, it was definitely a like, purposeful leak.
[3778.38 → 3780.26] And I think it was something to do with April Fool's.
[3780.84 → 3781.08] Yes.
[3781.08 → 3783.92] And I don't think they were even actually planning on doing it.
[3783.92 → 3790.92] And then it, like, front-paged so hard and people liked it so much that they might actually be doing it now.
[3791.50 → 3791.72] Yeah.
[3791.80 → 3793.08] So, it kind of started as a joke.
[3793.70 → 3794.14] Yeah, exactly.
[3794.24 → 3797.30] So, it was originally, I believe it was a Hyperkin employee.
[3797.54 → 3798.88] They just posted it as a joke.
[3798.96 → 3800.00] It's like April Fool's, whatever.
[3800.00 → 3804.42] Um, if you guys haven't seen it, basically what it is, is its kind of like a Game Boy shell.
[3804.54 → 3806.38] So, Hyperkin, they make a lot of, like, emulators.
[3806.62 → 3808.50] Or, I guess, what do you, would you call it an emulator?
[3809.06 → 3809.36] I guess.
[3809.42 → 3810.70] I mean, it plays like the original cartridge.
[3810.82 → 3815.16] Yes, but what it does is it pulls the ROM off the cartridge and then emulates it.
[3815.22 → 3815.90] So, it's an emulator.
[3816.10 → 3816.24] Yeah.
[3816.44 → 3816.66] Okay.
[3816.74 → 3820.74] So, basically, it would be like, so you slide, like, an iPhone 6 in the top.
[3820.74 → 3824.66] Um, it has, like, the actual, like, if you cover up, like, the bottom half of the screen,
[3824.72 → 3826.80] like, you actually have, like, the Game Boy style buttons.
[3827.14 → 3830.20] Then you could actually put an original Game Boy card in the back.
[3830.44 → 3835.08] They said, like, it might be able to, you know, have a battery backup for the iPhone and all this kind of stuff.
[3835.32 → 3838.64] And you could actually play original Game Boy games on, like, an iPhone screen,
[3838.70 → 3840.54] which is obviously way better than the original Game Boy.
[3840.66 → 3842.00] So, it's a cool idea.
[3842.34 → 3845.36] And, apparently, they, like you said, everyone was super excited about it.
[3845.36 → 3846.38] So, they decided to do it.
[3846.46 → 3848.48] Or, they're putting it in development.
[3848.78 → 3850.10] So, we'll see what it actually looks like.
[3850.10 → 3853.40] But, I think my problem is, is how are they actually going to pull this off?
[3853.52 → 3853.68] Right?
[3853.72 → 3854.42] Like, I get it.
[3854.44 → 3854.56] Yeah.
[3854.58 → 3855.74] You could absolutely have, like, a Bluetooth.
[3856.06 → 3859.84] Or, I don't know if iPhones support, like, actual wired controllers.
[3860.26 → 3861.86] I'm not sure if you could, like, hook it up via Lightning.
[3861.92 → 3864.12] But, even if they couldn't, you can do, like, a Bluetooth controller.
[3864.32 → 3864.46] Yeah.
[3864.84 → 3865.54] That's fine.
[3865.84 → 3867.26] You can have, like, a battery in there.
[3867.74 → 3869.30] I'm sure they can work out a way.
[3869.44 → 3874.66] I know they already have lots of emulators for, I think, even, like, some of their consoles already do Game Boy games.
[3874.66 → 3874.90] Right?
[3876.18 → 3876.46] Yeah.
[3876.60 → 3876.74] No.
[3876.84 → 3878.48] Some of their consoles definitely do Game Boy games.
[3878.48 → 3883.14] Um, I don't know a lot about, uh, what you can do with Lightning connectors.
[3883.28 → 3884.68] Because I haven't really been an iPhone user.
[3885.06 → 3888.72] Um, do you know if there's flash drives for iPhones?
[3889.34 → 3890.16] Oh, that's a good question.
[3890.22 → 3891.44] I know there are micro USB ones.
[3891.44 → 3891.64] Because I know you can do that.
[3892.30 → 3892.52] Yeah.
[3892.62 → 3894.70] I know you can do that with Android phones.
[3894.70 → 3898.94] I think the problem is, I don't know what you could actually use a flash drive for on iOS.
[3898.94 → 3907.48] I don't, I mean, I know you, there's, like, an adapter that you can, uh, like, get, like, a full-size USB port, as well as, uh, I think it's the camera connection kit, where you can also hook up, like, an SD card.
[3907.72 → 3907.92] Okay.
[3907.92 → 3912.08] But, like, when you do that, all it does is just, uh, takes it and brings it into, like, the Photos app.
[3912.12 → 3914.46] Like, you can't actually, you don't get, like, a file manager.
[3914.52 → 3915.24] That might be enough.
[3915.24 → 3915.62] Yeah, sure.
[3915.80 → 3916.78] That's probably enough, then.
[3916.80 → 3919.70] Because if you can send data up, well, of course you can send data up.
[3919.76 → 3921.70] You can move, uh, files from here.
[3921.74 → 3922.64] Okay, then that's fine.
[3922.66 → 3930.88] Because all they would need to do is have the Hyperkin component pull the ROM off the card that you put in, or cartridge that you put in, sorry.
[3931.02 → 3934.68] And then bring it into an emulation app on your phone.
[3935.02 → 3936.44] And then it would just run an app on your phone.
[3936.62 → 3938.36] That, that's, that would be totally fine.
[3938.40 → 3941.04] And then all they'd have to do is pull data and give battery life.
[3941.12 → 3942.98] This honestly doesn't even sound that hard to make.
[3943.24 → 3944.24] There's one problem, though.
[3944.40 → 3944.64] What?
[3944.64 → 3947.42] But Apple is always taking down any kind of emulation app.
[3947.46 → 3951.12] And I don't see why this would be any different, even if it's using the actual ROM data.
[3951.32 → 3958.84] So, I get, like, if you had, like, a jailbroken phone, or maybe they have, because I know there was a Game Boy emulator that you could download in Safari.
[3958.94 → 3960.46] But it was, like, it was, like, a little hacky.
[3960.54 → 3963.38] Like, you had to reset your calendar to, like, a certain date.
[3963.50 → 3969.72] And I believe it would use, like, a, it would use some kind of certificate that was not originally meant for, like, just downloading random apps.
[3969.76 → 3972.12] I think it was for, like, a corporate thing or something.
[3972.12 → 3973.32] I don't remember the exact details.
[3973.32 → 3975.46] But, so there might be some kind of workaround.
[3975.54 → 3981.56] But I feel like the biggest thing is they can't just put in an app that uses Game Boy, like, that's a Game Boy emulator in the App Store.
[3981.66 → 3982.84] Like, Apple would just take that down.
[3983.24 → 3983.38] So...
[3983.38 → 3983.46] Yeah.
[3984.12 → 3987.26] Hyperkin could easily just develop it for Android.
[3987.26 → 3992.90] Yeah, and I think even in the original post, they mentioned that, I mean, they might be able to swap out Lightning with, like, micro USB.
[3993.06 → 3995.34] I think if they did that, it would be completely fine.
[3995.34 → 3996.36] It would totally work.
[3996.46 → 3997.08] Yeah, there's no problem.
[3997.28 → 4000.16] The only problem you have with that is the form factor changing so much.
[4000.28 → 4000.52] Right.
[4000.66 → 4000.94] Yeah.
[4000.98 → 4003.92] So, you'd have to make it for, like, a few different devices or...
[4003.92 → 4007.00] Yeah, have, like, adjustable slider things on the side or whatever.
[4007.14 → 4008.08] I don't know what they would do.
[4008.56 → 4011.38] But it would probably be a little bit more complicated because of that.
[4011.54 → 4014.66] But they'd be able to get around the no emulator stuff.
[4015.22 → 4015.44] Yeah.
[4015.82 → 4016.92] Which is probably...
[4016.92 → 4017.84] Would kill them.
[4017.84 → 4025.92] Unless they're able to talk to Apple and be like, yeah, but they have to have the physical cartridge.
[4026.46 → 4027.50] Which helps a lot.
[4027.98 → 4029.42] It definitely helps their case.
[4030.36 → 4030.76] But...
[4030.76 → 4031.54] It's still emulation.
[4031.78 → 4032.22] Yeah.
[4032.48 → 4033.48] It's still definitely emulation.
[4033.50 → 4035.38] I don't think Apple's going to be all that nice to them.
[4035.38 → 4039.30] I think this makes a lot more sense if you have, like, an Android phone with just a normal micro USB port.
[4039.30 → 4039.94] I think that would...
[4039.94 → 4042.90] In that case, it would be completely fine and, you know, it would be no problem.
[4042.98 → 4044.02] But it is a cool idea.
[4044.02 → 4051.24] I can totally see rocking this giant battery Game Boy case and, you know, playing some old school actual Game Boy cards on my phone.
[4051.32 → 4051.70] That'd be dope.
[4051.98 → 4054.36] I'd do it because I actually still play...
[4054.36 → 4057.96] Like, I have the Game Boy 2DS.
[4058.82 → 4059.08] Yeah.
[4059.48 → 4061.52] Which I play, like, Smash and stuff on.
[4061.90 → 4066.72] But then I actually still get more use out of my Advance and my Game Boy Colour.
[4067.22 → 4068.32] Wait, Advance or Advance SP?
[4069.98 → 4071.58] You're probably an Advance SP fan.
[4071.64 → 4072.44] I just have an Advance.
[4072.44 → 4074.60] Dude, the Advance SP is so much better.
[4074.70 → 4075.68] You get the backlit screen.
[4075.68 → 4076.02] I know.
[4076.02 → 4076.92] You get the foldable design.
[4077.00 → 4077.96] You get a rechargeable battery.
[4078.18 → 4079.42] I haven't bought a new one.
[4079.90 → 4083.30] I have my same Advance from, like, when it launched when I was a kid.
[4083.46 → 4084.84] And it still works.
[4085.08 → 4086.88] So, I'm like, I don't know.
[4087.66 → 4088.76] Dude, when the Advance first came out...
[4088.76 → 4089.30] I know they're better.
[4090.00 → 4092.56] When the Advance first came out, I was, like, so anti-SP.
[4092.66 → 4093.94] It's like, ah, it's just junk.
[4094.00 → 4097.70] Because I had, like, the giant adapter with the light so, like, I could see the screen.
[4097.84 → 4099.34] Which is, like, huge and bulky and annoying.
[4099.34 → 4099.86] Yeah.
[4099.96 → 4101.14] But, like, I was so sold on that.
[4101.18 → 4102.30] I was like, ah, I'm never going to get an SP.
[4102.68 → 4103.50] Then my friend got one.
[4103.56 → 4104.94] I was like, oh, that's the greatest thing ever.
[4105.08 → 4106.30] And then, like, I was completely sold.
[4107.16 → 4108.36] Just getting a little off-topic here.
[4108.40 → 4110.24] The SP is, like, my favourite Game Boy of all time.
[4110.26 → 4112.34] Because it plays every Game Boy game.
[4112.52 → 4114.10] Game Boy, Game Boy Colour, Game Boy Advance.
[4114.44 → 4115.62] It's got a rechargeable battery.
[4115.80 → 4119.26] And mine, I had the same battery in that thing for, like, 12 years.
[4119.42 → 4120.84] Or 11 years.
[4121.58 → 4122.22] And it still worked.
[4122.30 → 4124.38] It still, I mean, there's, like, 20 minutes of battery left at the end.
[4124.42 → 4125.16] But it still worked.
[4125.42 → 4125.60] Yeah.
[4125.60 → 4126.66] It's the best.
[4126.74 → 4128.72] The only problem is the SP does not have a headphone jack.
[4128.86 → 4131.64] And you have to get this stupid dongle that hooks up to, like, the link port.
[4131.80 → 4132.02] Yeah.
[4132.14 → 4132.86] And then plug it in the headphone.
[4132.94 → 4133.70] It's really dumb.
[4133.82 → 4136.56] Well, besides that, Game Boy Advance SP Master Race.
[4136.82 → 4137.12] Yes.
[4137.30 → 4137.56] Yes.
[4137.82 → 4142.70] The only game I, like, every play is just my ancient, I have no idea how the internal
[4142.70 → 4144.68] battery is still going, Game Boy Blue cart.
[4145.82 → 4146.60] Or Game Boy Blue.
[4146.66 → 4147.20] Why did I say that?
[4147.26 → 4147.78] Pokémon Blue?
[4148.32 → 4153.24] I don't think the first-gen Pokémon games had issues with the battery running out.
[4153.30 → 4156.50] I know the second-gen did, because they had the clock and you would lose your save.
[4156.80 → 4162.14] I think the first-gen, even if the battery dies, I think it only affects, like, I don't
[4162.14 → 4163.08] think it's a big deal.
[4163.12 → 4164.74] I think the save data is still intact.
[4164.84 → 4165.38] I might be wrong.
[4165.44 → 4167.36] I know the second-gen definitely has problems with that.
[4167.36 → 4167.52] Okay.
[4167.52 → 4170.84] Because I remember I had to solder, like, the new battery.
[4170.94 → 4171.70] Oh, you actually.
[4171.70 → 4173.42] It's not hard.
[4173.52 → 4176.22] You just have to, like, pop off the back of it and you just, like, you solder on.
[4176.22 → 4177.54] It takes, like, five minutes.
[4177.84 → 4179.26] I think the first-gen games are okay.
[4179.68 → 4183.50] I've actually been waiting, because it's interesting that it doesn't know, so I know
[4183.50 → 4189.30] that, but I was kind of waiting for mine to die so that I could learn how to do that
[4189.30 → 4190.94] battery swap and just film a video about it.
[4190.94 → 4193.52] Dude, I did a tutorial on it, like, in 2011.
[4193.96 → 4194.48] Oh, wow.
[4194.58 → 4194.76] Okay.
[4194.82 → 4195.84] That's probably why I haven't seen it.
[4196.36 → 4197.78] Yeah, it was a long time ago.
[4197.98 → 4198.62] But it's not hard.
[4198.66 → 4199.14] It's not hard at all.
[4199.22 → 4201.30] You can get, like, they even sell, like, the screwdriver.
[4201.52 → 4203.76] Like, you can get, like, the kits of just, like, a couple batteries.
[4203.98 → 4205.36] It's super easy, dude.
[4205.36 → 4207.96] And you can save, like, your old games that are dead.
[4208.18 → 4212.18] So, if you have, like, any of the newer games that aren't saving or anything anymore, it's
[4212.18 → 4213.00] totally worth it.
[4213.02 → 4216.38] Because I know, like, some of those carts are, like, worth 30, 40, 50 bucks.
[4216.68 → 4218.50] But without a battery, they're, like, junk.
[4218.84 → 4219.72] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[4219.88 → 4220.68] There's a lot of them around there.
[4220.76 → 4221.78] But anyway, side.
[4222.26 → 4222.54] Sketchy.
[4223.20 → 4225.52] Don't ever put a Game Boy thing on this list.
[4225.72 → 4226.98] Again, just throw that out there.
[4227.18 → 4230.84] Like, it's a bad idea unless people want to hear Game Boy.
[4231.32 → 4232.42] I like talking about Game Boy.
[4232.48 → 4232.68] Okay.
[4233.02 → 4233.44] You know what?
[4233.56 → 4233.90] Screw it.
[4233.90 → 4234.96] We're almost at the end of the show.
[4234.96 → 4235.96] I don't mind targeting.
[4236.82 → 4237.04] Do it.
[4237.04 → 4238.38] We have only one topic left to do.
[4238.46 → 4238.98] We have time.
[4239.38 → 4241.86] The new 3DS, whatever the heck.
[4241.94 → 4242.40] What do you think?
[4243.12 → 4244.08] New 3DS XL.
[4244.36 → 4244.60] All right.
[4245.08 → 4246.76] So, the first 3DS.
[4247.04 → 4247.44] So, hang on.
[4247.58 → 4249.92] How far are you along as far as, like, 3DS is?
[4249.96 → 4250.44] Have you ever messed?
[4250.52 → 4251.38] You said you have a 2DS?
[4251.60 → 4252.14] I have a 2DS.
[4252.32 → 4253.36] I've played with a 3DS.
[4253.50 → 4254.62] I've played with a 3DS XL.
[4255.18 → 4256.44] I just only personally have a 2DS.
[4256.50 → 4256.92] So, you never.
[4257.14 → 4259.20] Have you ever messed around with the original 3DS screen?
[4259.74 → 4260.02] Yes.
[4260.02 → 4260.54] 3DS.
[4261.30 → 4261.50] And?
[4263.18 → 4263.98] In 3D?
[4264.56 → 4264.82] Yeah.
[4264.98 → 4265.48] Hated it.
[4265.70 → 4266.48] Absolutely hated it.
[4266.62 → 4268.40] Not even remotely okay with it.
[4268.68 → 4272.58] So, that's what the 3DS XL, I think for most people, that's the whole upgrade, right?
[4272.84 → 4273.56] So, it has a little.
[4273.78 → 4274.30] I don't know if it's a.
[4274.48 → 4277.06] I know it has a front-facing camera like all 3DSs do.
[4277.06 → 4279.60] Because it can tell where you're sitting in relation to it, right?
[4279.60 → 4282.48] And it's kind of like a cool, like, little graphic, like, when you go to set it up.
[4282.54 → 4285.34] Like, you can actually see, like, your face, like, as you move left and right and up and down.
[4285.44 → 4286.86] Like, it actually, like, tracks you.
[4287.24 → 4288.32] That makes a huge difference.
[4288.52 → 4290.86] I'm still not a massive fan of the 3D.
[4291.12 → 4296.64] But I feel like that upgrade alone makes the 3DS actually a 3DS.
[4297.20 → 4298.66] I think that's a big upgrade.
[4299.46 → 4301.06] There's some really stupid things.
[4301.16 → 4301.90] Like, they moved.
[4302.38 → 4302.74] Okay.
[4302.84 → 4305.78] So, every DS and 3DS model, I feel like, they moved the stylus.
[4305.78 → 4306.94] Like, it was on top.
[4307.06 → 4308.16] They had, like, the extendable one.
[4308.30 → 4311.08] Then they put it on the right side, which is what they should do.
[4311.26 → 4312.62] And now they have it on the bottom.
[4312.72 → 4314.36] And it's just like, no, don't do that.
[4314.58 → 4314.78] Stop.
[4314.78 → 4316.38] So, they moved that.
[4316.56 → 4320.30] The card slot's also on the bottom now, which is not on the top, which is weird.
[4320.40 → 4321.08] That's weird, yeah.
[4321.08 → 4322.08] And they've got a micro SD.
[4322.60 → 4323.58] Nothing wrong with micro SD.
[4323.66 → 4327.48] I think a full-size SD on, like, a portable is kind of dumb because that's just taking up a lot of space.
[4327.62 → 4330.10] But you have to unscrew the back to get at the micro SD.
[4330.80 → 4332.86] So, I mean, it's not a big deal.
[4333.00 → 4334.10] I believe it's just a normal Phillips.
[4334.12 → 4335.32] I've never seen maybe why they did that.
[4335.78 → 4336.26] Yeah.
[4336.26 → 4337.76] It's going to be super easy to steal it.
[4338.40 → 4343.62] Well, the thing is, ever since, like, the DSI, you've had, like, a super, like, just flip a flap.
[4344.14 → 4344.68] Flip a flap.
[4345.08 → 4345.68] Flip a flap.
[4346.40 → 4347.36] You've got to flip a flap.
[4347.52 → 4349.78] You've just got to flip the flap and...
[4349.78 → 4351.98] I can't say that.
[4352.26 → 4355.66] You have to delicately remove the flap.
[4356.60 → 4357.56] It's just getting worse.
[4357.78 → 4359.08] You're not going to be able to do it.
[4359.08 → 4360.64] I'm going to push forward.
[4360.98 → 4361.16] Okay.
[4361.28 → 4367.42] So, you can easily just remove the small bit of rubber, and you can pop out the SD card.
[4367.68 → 4370.14] So, it's been like that ever since the original, like, the DSI.
[4370.32 → 4371.32] So, I don't know.
[4371.46 → 4371.94] It just...
[4371.94 → 4373.62] There are some weird decisions there.
[4373.62 → 4376.20] Also, there's no normal new 3DS.
[4376.74 → 4379.38] So, there used to be, like, the small 3DS.
[4379.60 → 4379.76] Yeah.
[4379.84 → 4381.98] Then they brought out the 3DS XL, which is...
[4381.98 → 4383.92] They've had, like, I think they had a DSI XL.
[4384.08 → 4384.86] So, no big deal.
[4385.18 → 4388.02] They brought out the 2DS, which is, like, the flat version that doesn't fold.
[4388.38 → 4391.14] It doesn't have 3D, which, honestly, I think is one of the better versions.
[4391.92 → 4393.80] But now they have a new 3DS XL.
[4394.12 → 4395.52] They didn't replace the normal size.
[4395.58 → 4397.88] So, if you want the new 3DS, you've got to get the XL.
[4398.00 → 4398.78] You've got to get the big...
[4398.78 → 4400.02] I think it's, like, 5-inch or something.
[4400.12 → 4401.50] It's a big console.
[4401.64 → 4401.80] Yeah.
[4402.32 → 4404.18] And the thing is, they have a normal 3DS.
[4404.54 → 4406.98] But they only sell it in Japan and, I believe, some other countries.
[4407.08 → 4408.40] But I know not here in North America.
[4408.74 → 4408.96] Right.
[4409.44 → 4410.70] That's a little bit weird to me.
[4410.74 → 4412.34] I know they were saying how they didn't...
[4412.34 → 4413.40] Because they've already got the 2DS.
[4413.62 → 4414.78] They've got the new 3DS XL.
[4414.94 → 4416.34] They thought that 2 was enough.
[4416.40 → 4417.68] They didn't think they really needed 3.
[4417.92 → 4418.12] Yeah.
[4418.12 → 4419.10] I get that logic.
[4419.20 → 4420.90] Especially because the 3DS XL is $200.
[4421.92 → 4424.62] So, that would mean they'd have to chop the price of the normal 3DS.
[4424.80 → 4425.82] But, I don't know.
[4426.10 → 4427.02] It's a good upgrade.
[4427.02 → 4428.18] I mean, there are some things.
[4428.28 → 4428.94] Like, it's faster.
[4430.04 → 4431.18] So, especially, like...
[4431.18 → 4433.68] The menus, I feel like I can't tell a huge difference.
[4433.86 → 4434.94] But, like, loading Smash.
[4435.10 → 4437.12] I was just going to say Smash load time.
[4437.58 → 4438.22] Big difference.
[4438.22 → 4439.54] I did a comparison.
[4439.74 → 4441.06] Like, I loaded them both up.
[4441.28 → 4443.96] I think it was, like, 15 seconds versus, like, 40 seconds.
[4444.08 → 4444.82] That's off the top of my head.
[4444.84 → 4446.26] But it was, like, a huge difference.
[4446.84 → 4448.00] So, that's cool.
[4448.08 → 4451.02] But then, on the flip side, Nintendo, they've had...
[4451.02 → 4455.68] So, again, backing up to when they brought out the DS, and they brought out the DSI.
[4455.68 → 4456.86] It was the same kind of thing, right?
[4456.92 → 4458.38] Like, they could still play all the same games.
[4458.58 → 4459.76] But the DSI was faster.
[4460.14 → 4461.12] It had some additional features.
[4461.22 → 4463.74] And there were actual apps that you could download to the DSI.
[4464.08 → 4465.30] The 3DS is the same deal.
[4465.62 → 4469.16] But this time, there are games that are coming out just for the new 3DS XL.
[4469.40 → 4469.48] Yeah.
[4469.90 → 4470.10] Right?
[4470.30 → 4473.74] So, your 2DS is not going to be able to play a few new games.
[4473.86 → 4475.44] And I've seen more and more coming out.
[4475.70 → 4476.98] Like, at first, there was just, like, one or two.
[4477.08 → 4479.30] And now I know there are at least three of them, I believe.
[4479.74 → 4481.08] And it's, like, it's...
[4481.08 → 4483.58] It's, like, what are they doing?
[4483.72 → 4484.52] They have this 3DS.
[4484.92 → 4484.94] Weird segregation.
[4485.22 → 4485.80] Yeah, exactly.
[4485.92 → 4491.78] So, now you buy a 3DS game, which already confuses people with the 2DS because they don't know if that actually works.
[4491.94 → 4492.88] And DS games.
[4493.16 → 4495.84] And now you have a 3DS game, but it's the new 3DS game.
[4495.90 → 4498.32] So, it doesn't work on your old 3DS or your 2DS.
[4499.16 → 4501.84] And it's called the new 3DS.
[4501.96 → 4502.16] Yes.
[4502.16 → 4503.26] That's not confusing at all, right?
[4503.26 → 4505.40] They're doing so bad with their naming.
[4505.40 → 4512.10] And, yes, like you just said, buying a 2DS and then being, like, no games exist for this is genuinely a problem.
[4512.50 → 4512.86] Yeah, exactly.
[4513.10 → 4515.20] And then the new thing is messed up.
[4515.32 → 4516.20] And it's...
[4516.20 → 4516.58] Ah!
[4516.64 → 4523.04] When you call games, like, new whatever, that's not nearly as big of a deal as calling a console new whatever.
[4523.04 → 4523.22] Right.
[4523.50 → 4525.94] At least it was the DS and the DSI, right?
[4525.96 → 4526.60] Like, there was...
[4526.60 → 4526.94] Yes.
[4527.46 → 4529.44] Because, like, you can just say, oh, I've got the new 3DS.
[4529.44 → 4531.94] You mean, like, the new 3DS or just the new 3DS?
[4532.70 → 4532.98] Uh...
[4532.98 → 4533.42] I don't know.
[4533.54 → 4534.36] Which game does it play?
[4534.36 → 4535.02] I don't know.
[4535.04 → 4536.00] It doesn't play some games.
[4536.40 → 4537.24] It just...
[4537.24 → 4537.62] What?
[4538.18 → 4538.54] Ugh.
[4539.34 → 4540.76] Nothing about this makes sense.
[4541.18 → 4544.92] So, yes, the new 3DS XL, in my opinion, is a better console.
[4545.04 → 4546.42] Like, there are some cool upgrades.
[4546.94 → 4549.12] And, you know, just apples to apples, yeah, sure.
[4549.24 → 4552.46] If you're just going to go buy a new 3DS, get the 3DS XL, you know, it's better.
[4552.64 → 4553.42] No big deal.
[4553.52 → 4558.48] But just so many dumb decisions on the part of Nintendo on this whole thing.
[4558.82 → 4560.26] It drives me crazy.
[4560.44 → 4561.90] Like, what are they thinking?
[4562.34 → 4563.08] Like, I just...
[4563.08 → 4564.64] I could go on this for a long time.
[4564.72 → 4565.40] I should stop.
[4565.74 → 4565.86] All right.
[4565.86 → 4566.86] But...
[4566.86 → 4568.14] I have to call it...
[4568.14 → 4570.84] Someone in the chat, Pink Snow birdie just said 3DS 1.
[4571.48 → 4572.16] Amazing idea.
[4573.12 → 4573.76] Definitely do that.
[4573.80 → 4574.46] Just call it the 1.
[4574.56 → 4575.78] Just like everybody else was.
[4576.10 → 4576.92] Oh, no.
[4577.44 → 4577.86] What do we have?
[4578.08 → 4581.00] Well, so there's Xbox One, HTC One.
[4581.58 → 4582.32] I feel like there's another one, right?
[4582.38 → 4583.14] One plus one.
[4583.44 → 4584.06] One plus one.
[4584.12 → 4584.58] That's the line.
[4585.12 → 4585.34] Yeah.
[4585.96 → 4586.12] Yeah.
[4586.12 → 4587.20] Yeah.
[4587.44 → 4588.10] Names, guys.
[4588.34 → 4588.98] Learn how to do them.
[4589.02 → 4590.08] And Apple does the same thing.
[4590.38 → 4591.72] Going down the rabbit hole even more.
[4591.96 → 4593.40] When they do, like, the new MacBook.
[4593.88 → 4595.08] Can you give it a name, please?
[4595.24 → 4595.48] Yeah.
[4595.98 → 4597.94] Like, everyone's going to be searching new MacBook.
[4598.24 → 4598.48] Great.
[4598.56 → 4600.62] Like, when my friend's like, hey, do you know...
[4600.62 → 4602.10] Like, I want to get a new laptop.
[4602.20 → 4603.40] Do you know how much my MacBook's worth?
[4603.92 → 4607.32] And I'm like, I can check local sites for you or whatever.
[4607.42 → 4608.08] And they're like, cool.
[4608.78 → 4610.42] Like, which MacBook do you have?
[4610.42 → 4611.52] Oh, like, a Pro.
[4613.42 → 4614.20] Which one?
[4614.44 → 4615.42] They're like...
[4615.94 → 4616.52] I don't know.
[4616.54 → 4617.04] It just says Pro.
[4617.16 → 4617.54] I don't know.
[4617.66 → 4618.42] I'm just like...
[4618.42 → 4619.86] Oh, cool, dude.
[4620.14 → 4620.74] And that's the thing.
[4620.88 → 4622.70] Like, the new MacBook...
[4622.70 → 4625.62] So, there's the MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro.
[4625.80 → 4626.30] Which is fine.
[4626.40 → 4628.06] Like, that's different enough, but...
[4628.06 → 4629.30] That's an alright lineup, yeah.
[4629.90 → 4630.16] Yeah.
[4630.28 → 4631.14] And I get it.
[4631.24 → 4634.54] Like, you know, it's like the MacBook Pro 2015 or 2013.
[4634.72 → 4635.46] Like, that's okay.
[4635.58 → 4636.64] Like, you know, you buy a car.
[4636.72 → 4638.54] It's like a 2015 Civic, right?
[4638.54 → 4640.36] It's easy enough to kind of understand that.
[4640.42 → 4640.54] Yeah.
[4640.68 → 4642.18] But I just feel like...
[4642.18 → 4643.98] They've done the same thing with, like, the iPad, right?
[4644.06 → 4644.98] Like, wasn't...
[4644.98 → 4646.60] One of the iPads was, like, the new iPad.
[4646.98 → 4647.24] Yeah.
[4647.64 → 4651.78] And then now they've retroactively changed the name to, like, iPad 3 or something.
[4652.08 → 4653.08] It's just...
[4653.08 → 4654.34] Guys, names are not that difficult.
[4655.00 → 4657.08] And, like, have it on the product.
[4657.40 → 4661.30] If it's MacBook Pro 2015, have it say MacBook Pro 2015.
[4661.74 → 4661.94] Yeah.
[4662.02 → 4665.96] And not, like, you have to decipher the serial number and go, ah, oh, it ends in 3.
[4665.96 → 4667.36] I mean, it must be in 2013.
[4667.96 → 4668.14] No.
[4668.46 → 4668.60] Ah.
[4669.00 → 4669.78] Just, no.
[4669.78 → 4669.82] No.
[4670.34 → 4670.70] Ridiculous.
[4671.18 → 4676.64] Moving into what I think might be our last topic is Intel launches 750 series NVMe SSD,
[4677.06 → 4678.96] 2.5 inch, and PCIe.
[4679.68 → 4681.04] Wait, there's a 2.5 inch?
[4681.18 → 4681.36] What?
[4681.50 → 4682.30] There is a 2.5 inch.
[4682.56 → 4683.22] I have it.
[4683.26 → 4683.60] Oh, wow.
[4684.00 → 4684.78] You have it?
[4684.94 → 4685.50] I have it.
[4685.52 → 4686.14] I did not even...
[4686.14 → 4687.68] I thought it was just PCIe only.
[4687.88 → 4688.58] Oh, that's awesome, dude.
[4688.78 → 4689.88] It is super awesome.
[4690.20 → 4691.46] I completely went over my radar.
[4691.46 → 4695.32] The poppy part about the story is I can't plug it in.
[4697.60 → 4698.08] Yeah.
[4698.48 → 4699.64] Custom cable required.
[4700.28 → 4704.38] So, um, Asus is actually going to end up hooking us up super hardcore.
[4704.38 → 4710.96] Um, unfortunately, the cable didn't show up, I think, largely due to, um, the extended holidays
[4710.96 → 4712.20] due to Easter and stuff.
[4712.40 → 4715.28] But hopefully I'll be getting it early next week, and hopefully I'll be able to test this
[4715.28 → 4716.74] super quickly before I have to leave.
[4716.74 → 4720.74] Um, but yeah, super sick drive.
[4720.80 → 4726.78] It's supposed to be four times the what, uh, the reads and two times the writes of current
[4726.78 → 4730.52] SATA SSDs, because it is a SATA Express drive.
[4731.06 → 4734.50] So it, you, you're not going to just plug normal SATA cables into this guy.
[4734.58 → 4735.86] It needs a SATA Express connector.
[4736.28 → 4736.72] Right.
[4736.76 → 4741.28] It's coming in 400 gigabytes and 1.2 terabyte capacities.
[4741.52 → 4742.56] And the prices aren't bad.
[4742.96 → 4743.88] The prices aren't bad at all.
[4743.88 → 4747.08] I feel like it's, it's like the 400 gig is somewhere around $400.
[4747.62 → 4752.70] Like that's actually, I mean, it's expensive, but it's not, it's not like sell a kidney expensive
[4752.70 → 4755.14] like a lot of PCI SSDs have been in the past.
[4755.22 → 4755.80] I think that's awesome.
[4756.04 → 4757.46] But hang on, let me go back a little bit.
[4757.62 → 4760.04] So the 2.5 inch, it's not a SATA drive.
[4760.52 → 4761.36] It's SATA Express.
[4761.88 → 4762.92] That's a custom connector.
[4763.22 → 4763.52] That means.
[4763.52 → 4764.28] Oh, so that's the cable.
[4764.42 → 4768.10] So you got, you have to route a cable from the drive to a PCI Express slot.
[4768.38 → 4768.70] Yeah.
[4768.70 → 4777.78] And what the cable that Intel sent me is PCI Express to HD mini SAS, not like PCI Express
[4777.78 → 4778.86] to PCI Express.
[4778.86 → 4780.40] Because I have a few boards that can take that.
[4781.08 → 4787.34] So the connector that I'm hopefully getting is going to be HD mini SAS to M.2.
[4787.34 → 4789.94] So it's going to be like this.
[4789.98 → 4792.24] That's also not complicated or confusing whatsoever.
[4793.68 → 4799.04] So hopefully that shows up, and hopefully I'll be able to test it because honestly, this drive
[4799.04 → 4800.16] looks absolutely sick.
[4800.68 → 4800.96] Yeah.
[4801.30 → 4803.84] I mean, so you said it's like four times.
[4803.84 → 4808.42] So isn't it supposed to be like north of like two gigs of like reads, I think, two gigabytes
[4808.42 → 4808.90] per second.
[4809.20 → 4811.42] I don't know the exact, because I haven't tested it yet personally.
[4811.50 → 4811.78] Yeah.
[4811.94 → 4815.96] I tried to stay off a little bit, but it looks like sequential reads 2.2.
[4816.12 → 4816.30] Yeah.
[4817.34 → 4820.06] And the 1.2 terabyte has 2.4.
[4821.54 → 4822.72] You know, it's funny.
[4822.80 → 4826.98] Like when the first like SATA SSDs were coming out and everyone's just losing their mind
[4826.98 → 4828.10] at how great they were.
[4828.46 → 4832.38] But then for a while there for me, I was like, okay, they're pretty much all the same, especially
[4832.38 → 4832.76] nowadays.
[4832.76 → 4838.06] Like most SATA drives, SATA SSDs that you buy today, you're not really going to be able
[4838.06 → 4839.08] to tell a major difference.
[4839.28 → 4841.02] Like they're, they've kind of all saturated.
[4841.22 → 4845.86] So when some of the first PCI Express SSDs came out, I was like, ah, sweet.
[4845.86 → 4846.68] This is way faster.
[4846.78 → 4850.82] Like I could tell a difference, but you know, these were like one gigabyte per second, maybe
[4850.82 → 4851.42] a little bit less.
[4851.64 → 4851.78] Yeah.
[4851.78 → 4855.84] I would, I would like to see if making that next step to like the two gigabytes per second
[4855.84 → 4857.68] is actually going to be able to be noticeable.
[4857.68 → 4861.08] Because I feel like there's got to be some, somewhere along this chain where, yeah, it looks
[4861.08 → 4864.78] good as a benchmark, but I mean, is it, is it actually going to be noticeable?
[4864.88 → 4865.46] Is it realistic?
[4865.66 → 4867.24] That's, that's one thing that I plan on testing.
[4867.36 → 4868.24] Give me one quick second.
[4868.24 → 4870.72] Because a bunch of people in the chat are getting mad at me.
[4870.80 → 4872.24] I phrased something a little bit weird.
[4872.56 → 4873.60] It's not SATA Express.
[4873.72 → 4874.04] You're right.
[4874.20 → 4876.26] But I don't know if you can still hear me.
[4877.86 → 4879.50] So now that he's gone.
[4879.54 → 4880.56] No, no, I'm not completely.
[4880.74 → 4880.94] No.
[4881.66 → 4883.20] I was going to take over.
[4883.20 → 4883.50] You're right.
[4884.34 → 4892.98] It is not SATA Express, but it uses that type of connector.
[4894.32 → 4895.96] I can't see it, but I'm just going to go with it.
[4896.68 → 4897.04] Yeah.
[4897.20 → 4900.18] I'm going to trust that it's some kind of connector that it connects things.
[4900.60 → 4900.68] Maybe.
[4900.82 → 4901.12] My headphones.
[4901.58 → 4902.26] I couldn't hear you.
[4902.28 → 4902.48] Sorry.
[4903.18 → 4904.44] Oh, I can't see what you're saying.
[4904.44 → 4907.02] So I'm just going to assume it's some kind of connector that connects things.
[4907.32 → 4907.38] Yes.
[4907.38 → 4908.58] Trickle isn't as funny the second time.
[4908.58 → 4916.02] So it's SFF8639, which is like completely baller sauce.
[4916.30 → 4918.30] Anyway, I want to actually test this drive out.
[4918.66 → 4921.66] I know I said that in a weird way and Twitch chat corrected me.
[4921.72 → 4922.34] Sorry about that.
[4922.80 → 4926.78] But yeah, that's the connector that I'm using on the actual drive.
[4927.98 → 4933.46] So that goes into the drive, which is the connector I just talked about.
[4933.52 → 4936.38] And then this is the mini SAS, HD mini SAS that I have.
[4936.38 → 4937.82] Which is what I totally did.
[4937.84 → 4941.72] So this is a PCIe 3.0 4X, right?
[4943.34 → 4945.10] This is a two and a half inch drive.
[4946.12 → 4946.38] No, no.
[4946.40 → 4946.80] I mean, I'm sorry.
[4946.88 → 4950.42] Like the connector that it needs four lanes of PCIe 3.0, right?
[4950.42 → 4950.68] Oh, yes.
[4950.70 → 4951.20] I believe so.
[4951.64 → 4954.54] So I wonder how that's going to affect.
[4954.76 → 4956.24] I mean, that's a lot of bandwidth, right?
[4956.28 → 4958.46] Like if you've got like maybe like multi-GPUs and stuff,
[4958.54 → 4960.22] like you're going to run out of lanes pretty quick, right?
[4960.54 → 4965.18] That's already been an interesting story, even without having these types of drives.
[4965.18 → 4967.12] So that's even going to become more interesting down the line.
[4967.44 → 4969.48] And especially if you get like multiple of them.
[4970.34 → 4973.72] Now, like obviously RAID and stuff, not really.
[4974.16 → 4977.84] But yeah, you can still possibly have multiple drives.
[4977.94 → 4979.40] So that's going to be an interesting story.
[4979.46 → 4980.28] We're going to need more lanes.
[4980.92 → 4981.28] Yeah.
[4981.40 → 4981.78] And on top of that.
[4981.78 → 4987.70] I believe it doesn't actually support like, it's not just like you plug it in like a SATA drive.
[4987.76 → 4993.68] I believe only some of the more recent Intel chipsets like X99 and X, or no, Z97.
[4994.38 → 4997.26] I'm pretty sure those are the two that are supported out of the box, right?
[4998.66 → 4999.02] Yeah.
[4999.58 → 4999.82] Yeah.
[5000.02 → 5001.92] Those are the ones I've seen stuff on.
[5002.12 → 5003.26] So you're going to have some problems.
[5003.26 → 5008.06] Although I believe Ryan Trout, I think he was talking on Twitter that he got it working on an AMD APU.
[5008.20 → 5009.90] Or at least, hang on, let me back up a little bit.
[5010.24 → 5011.78] It will work on other platforms.
[5011.86 → 5014.76] But as far as like using it as like your actual boot drive, you're going to have some problems.
[5014.76 → 5017.86] Because it's not really meant to, like the motherboard doesn't know what it's looking for.
[5018.00 → 5022.56] Well, that's also like Ghost just said, you can't RAID them, only software RAID.
[5022.60 → 5024.62] That's why I said, blah, when I talked about RAID.
[5024.62 → 5029.42] It's because it's not going over like standard drive stuff.
[5029.86 → 5031.78] It's kind of a weird solution.
[5032.00 → 5033.26] It's an all new frontier.
[5033.48 → 5034.64] It's so much to be discovered.
[5035.04 → 5035.32] Yes.
[5035.76 → 5037.32] I'm super excited to test it.
[5037.42 → 5045.34] And I'm going to try to do a bunch of the kinds of stuff that you brought up, which is like things where a lot of people kind of stopped testing them.
[5045.90 → 5048.00] Because it was like, well, you can't really notice a difference.
[5048.20 → 5051.50] I'm going to retry some of those with this and see if you can notice a difference.
[5051.50 → 5055.98] So the testing, I will definitely have numbers for everything and go like it was exactly this fast.
[5056.12 → 5059.64] But I'm also going to try and give an objective opinion of actually using the computer.
[5060.02 → 5064.86] Where it's like, oh, it's however a percent faster, which might sound like a lot.
[5064.94 → 5066.16] But do I actually notice this?
[5066.20 → 5068.38] And does it actually affect my workflow in any way at all?
[5068.72 → 5072.32] Or is it exactly the same essential conclusion in the end?
[5072.62 → 5076.68] And are you hitting like bottlenecks and like the CPU or memory before you, you know, the drive is actually slowing down.
[5076.68 → 5077.66] Right, something else in the system.
[5077.92 → 5078.10] Yeah.
[5078.52 → 5079.28] It's cool though.
[5079.28 → 5085.20] I can totally see for $400, I mean, if you want to get like somewhat of like a high-end gaming PC build.
[5085.56 → 5088.36] I mean, this thing is way faster than a normal state of drive.
[5088.40 → 5096.24] And I know that even if it's not hugely like faster than like even like a normal PCI Express slot, which is like, you know, a gig or whatever a lot of the current SSDs are.
[5096.70 → 5100.84] I mean, I can tell the difference, like I said, between like going from like 500 legs read to like a gig.
[5100.84 → 5109.62] So even if you can't tell the difference, like paying $400 for a 400 gig or roughly 400, I think it's somewhere in that neighbourhood, for a 400 gig SSD that's that fast.
[5109.86 → 5110.38] That's awesome.
[5110.42 → 5112.76] I think that that can go into a lot of gaming PC builds.
[5112.76 → 5117.68] Where before it was like, you know, this is PCI Express, and it's just got like RAID controllers and SATA.
[5117.80 → 5120.10] And it's just a big mess just waiting to happen.
[5120.24 → 5121.80] Like this is like, it's all native, right?
[5121.88 → 5124.06] It's all native, was it NVMe?
[5124.82 → 5125.60] Yes, NVMe.
[5125.82 → 5126.00] Yeah.
[5126.82 → 5127.06] So.
[5127.32 → 5129.90] I'm finally kind of moving away from AHCI, which is interesting.
[5130.22 → 5130.48] Yeah.
[5130.62 → 5132.22] I've been comfortable there for a little while.
[5132.40 → 5132.74] Yeah.
[5132.74 → 5134.50] I was like, oh, I finally got this figured out.
[5134.50 → 5135.42] Oh, great.
[5135.44 → 5136.24] Oh, damn.
[5136.90 → 5137.30] Okay.
[5137.46 → 5139.44] Time to learn some new stuff.
[5139.74 → 5142.20] NVMe, I think is going to be totally sick.
[5142.26 → 5143.52] So I'm really excited to test this drive.
[5143.90 → 5146.10] But that's it for the show.
[5146.60 → 5147.16] Was, was, was.
[5147.16 → 5154.12] So I have to jump back to that failure intro tab that we have, which is totally not even working right now.
[5154.18 → 5154.92] Did the stream just crash?
[5155.04 → 5155.40] No.
[5155.68 → 5156.00] Yes.
[5156.08 → 5156.32] Okay.
[5156.74 → 5157.06] We're good.
[5157.06 → 5157.80] No, yes.
[5157.96 → 5158.10] What?
[5158.44 → 5158.54] No.
[5158.66 → 5158.78] Yeah.
[5158.88 → 5159.32] No, yes.
[5159.42 → 5161.66] The worst, the worst thing that could ever be said on a show.
[5161.66 → 5166.24] So dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus, sorry for not switching to your lower third.
[5166.34 → 5167.08] You guys are awesome.
[5167.20 → 5168.96] I shave my face with that all the time.
[5169.34 → 5171.66] I literally shave my face with your company.
[5172.18 → 5175.02] So I don't know what you want to say about that.
[5175.56 → 5176.60] But yeah.
[5177.00 → 5177.40] Anyway.
[5177.62 → 5179.70] Also, do, do, do, do, do.
[5180.08 → 5180.74] Fresh books.
[5181.12 → 5184.26] If you are a small business or a freelancer, I know I was for a long time.
[5184.66 → 5186.42] Handling your own books can be super annoying.
[5186.42 → 5188.42] My dad was running a small business for a long time.
[5188.42 → 5193.22] And I think there's still people he hasn't built like now.
[5193.40 → 5196.94] And he hasn't been running that company for like what I assume would be about a year now.
[5197.14 → 5201.62] So maybe if he had fresh books, he would have been able to do that a little bit better.
[5201.74 → 5203.04] Not to rag on my own dad.
[5203.48 → 5207.72] Dude, I just did my own taxes and I went through piles of receipts trying to organize it.
[5208.02 → 5208.88] I hear you.
[5209.00 → 5210.00] And that sounds like a good idea.
[5210.44 → 5210.74] Yes.
[5210.94 → 5211.62] Completely agree.
[5212.00 → 5212.30] All right.
[5212.32 → 5214.04] I'm going to try to roll the intro and not fail.
[5214.62 → 5215.14] Let's see.
[5215.58 → 5216.26] Come on.
[5217.46 → 5217.82] Yes.
[5217.82 → 5219.30] Intro.
[5220.04 → 5220.94] Except it's lagging.
[5223.46 → 5224.74] This show's been lagging.
[5224.84 → 5226.22] I wouldn't complain too much.
[5226.22 → 5226.34] I know.
[5234.34 → 5235.64] Imagine awesome music.
[5238.70 → 5240.96] I'm just having to pretend because I can't say anything at all right now.
[5241.12 → 5241.56] No, I know.
[5242.04 → 5243.92] I'm just going to imagine what the intro looks like.
[5243.92 → 5244.80] It's always a weird to guess.
[5246.32 → 5247.02] Okay, guys.
[5247.18 → 5247.76] Thanks for watching.
[5247.90 → 5248.82] We'll see you next time.
[5249.14 → 5249.50] Goodbye.
[5250.24 → 5250.50] Later.
