[0.00 --> 6.60]  The WAN show is theoretically live so
[6.60 --> 7.60]  Hooray!
[7.60 --> 13.08]  No I'm not sure theoretically yeah frames
[13.08 --> 16.56]  encoded 389 that's a good thing which is
[16.56 --> 18.48]  good frames dropped but doesn't seem to
[18.48 --> 20.04]  necessarily mean much on twitch lately
[20.04 --> 24.00]  yeah we had some issues a little while
[24.00 --> 25.92]  ago yeah I've had issues on my private
[25.92 --> 27.72]  stream too lately like you can be
[27.72 --> 29.08]  setting everything perfectly but it'll
[29.08 --> 30.58]  be like oh well some server that you're
[30.58 --> 32.32]  not even going to is down so you're
[32.32 --> 36.94]  screwed yeah I have three call-outs for us
[36.94 --> 38.86]  now all the longer you're still doing
[38.86 --> 40.18]  things it'll actually be more and more
[40.18 --> 43.06]  setup excellent thank you so if we if we
[43.06 --> 45.40]  start when the show is supposed to end
[45.40 --> 51.40]  we'll be ready all right so our online
[51.40 --> 53.32]  viewers oh I'm getting a lot of happy
[53.32 --> 55.06]  birthday shoutouts in the twitch chat
[55.06 --> 57.58]  thank you very oh no longer his
[57.58 --> 60.82]  birthday make sure you say belated hold
[60.82 --> 63.58]  on a second here just gonna do a thing
[63.58 --> 71.32]  let me see playback devices open volume
[71.32 --> 77.56]  mixer there we go and there it is mute
[77.56 --> 80.82]  that all right there we go so
[80.82 --> 83.20]  apparently we can hear me fine okay cool
[83.20 --> 86.02]  all right so it is a very special WAN show
[86.02 --> 88.48]  today it is the day after my birthday
[88.48 --> 90.70]  which is very nice of everyone to
[90.70 --> 92.56]  notice it's not like any of my staff did
[92.56 --> 96.44]  I did that's a complete lie
[96.44 --> 100.24]  one it's on my calendar because I
[100.24 --> 101.86]  manually put everyone's birthdays on my
[101.86 --> 103.24]  calendar because I will not remember
[103.24 --> 105.58]  them if I don't even like my mom my
[105.58 --> 108.46]  brother everyone everyone has a manual
[108.46 --> 111.10]  entry so I remembered because Google
[111.10 --> 115.42]  remembered fantastic and it's also
[115.42 --> 118.72]  special because today is the day of the
[118.72 --> 123.22]  Linus media group live meet up here at
[123.22 --> 125.62]  our new headquarters we've got a lot of
[125.62 --> 128.86]  people braving braving the Sun and the
[128.86 --> 132.34]  fresh air to be here with us today it's
[132.34 --> 134.96]  not an easy thing to do and I totally I
[134.96 --> 137.30]  totally get it guys so huge thanks to
[137.30 --> 139.64]  everyone who's here and a huge thanks as
[139.64 --> 141.20]  well to everyone who's tuning in over
[141.20 --> 143.30]  the internet because let's face it it's
[143.30 --> 146.48]  not always easy to hop on a plane like
[146.48 --> 149.60]  some of our incredible viewers did I
[149.60 --> 152.60]  actually had three people drop off with
[152.60 --> 156.08]  me today some currency from their native
[156.08 --> 159.08]  lands we had one gentleman from Germany
[159.08 --> 162.86]  we had someone from Argentina and then I
[162.86 --> 166.70]  I had someone from I oh oh crap what is
[166.70 --> 168.50]  where is this one from that's the
[168.50 --> 170.48]  Argentine and that one's Norway yes
[170.48 --> 173.12]  there's the one so Johannes from Norway
[173.12 --> 176.48]  and I'm gonna butcher this Edith Edie
[176.48 --> 181.40]  Edie I s Edie thank you and then
[181.40 --> 184.82]  Sebastian who actually shares his first
[184.82 --> 187.22]  name with my last name even the same
[187.22 --> 190.40]  spelling which is which is unusual so we
[190.40 --> 192.68]  had an incredible turnout today some
[192.68 --> 196.46]  people hailing from BC who drove up to
[196.46 --> 198.32]  you know eight plus hours we had a
[198.32 --> 200.36]  couple people show up at the same time
[200.36 --> 203.66]  from Winnipeg how they managed to time
[203.66 --> 207.08]  that I'm not not completely certain so
[207.08 --> 209.90]  pretty pretty unbelievable there guys so
[209.90 --> 211.16]  we've got a bunch of great topics for
[211.16 --> 214.46]  you today I think I've got colors now
[214.46 --> 217.04]  yep the Ashley Madison hack has got some
[217.04 --> 220.16]  serious updates and we'll get to that
[220.16 --> 223.10]  later on on the show also a research lab
[223.10 --> 225.68]  has accidentally created a longer
[225.68 --> 228.62]  lasting battery how'd they do that well
[228.62 --> 230.72]  the same way oh hey oh here silly putty
[230.72 --> 233.36]  also an accident there you go I believe
[233.36 --> 234.32]  they were trying to make some kind of
[234.32 --> 236.90]  better rubber or something Google
[236.90 --> 238.88]  project Sunroof which is Google's way to
[238.88 --> 240.68]  try to help everybody get solar panels
[240.68 --> 243.20]  and also popcorn time users are finally
[243.20 --> 245.18]  getting attacked by various companies oh
[245.18 --> 247.04]  that was a matter of time yeah all
[247.04 --> 248.36]  right let's roll that intro think it's
[248.36 --> 249.98]  gonna work no actually I know for a fact
[249.98 --> 252.26]  it isn't gonna work oh what did I just
[252.26 --> 254.90]  do what hold on hold on I got this I got
[254.90 --> 257.00]  this I got this yeah whoa I thought you
[257.00 --> 258.50]  said it wasn't gonna work but sort of
[258.50 --> 260.96]  worked worked a little bit it is working
[260.96 --> 264.68]  though I want to go to the auction
[264.68 --> 270.38]  something cheap I don't I can miss out
[270.38 --> 271.94]  there will be something cheap I think
[271.94 --> 273.68]  there's still like a Titan black or two I
[273.68 --> 275.30]  actually did hear about that and
[275.30 --> 277.40]  there's like there's like only so many
[277.40 --> 280.16]  people that still have cash so I suspect
[280.16 --> 281.36]  they're taking it away for not a whole
[281.36 --> 285.56]  lot of it well if you can take like two
[285.56 --> 287.96]  dollars I think I'm good other than that I
[287.96 --> 289.62]  don't know so much I think we did
[289.62 --> 292.22]  multiples of five anyway okay so I think
[292.22 --> 294.74]  you're you're you're wrecked all right
[294.74 --> 296.42]  so why don't we jump right into our first
[296.42 --> 299.90]  topic of the day sure Google makes its own
[299.90 --> 303.68]  $200 wireless router on hub so the
[303.68 --> 305.00]  original art are you posting in the
[305.00 --> 307.58]  twitch chat sure okay you got this so the
[307.58 --> 309.44]  original article here is from the verge I'm
[309.44 --> 312.14]  just gonna go ahead and share that with
[312.14 --> 314.48]  you guys here I think I'm clicking news
[314.48 --> 316.80]  item nothing is happening where is my
[316.80 --> 321.12]  where is my window screen capture over
[321.12 --> 327.84]  this boom maybe just let it I got I got
[327.84 --> 330.00]  this I got this this show sometimes
[330.00 --> 333.54]  works today show must go on yes it's
[333.54 --> 335.10]  really not working what is happening
[335.10 --> 337.92]  anyways let's there we go let's cover
[337.92 --> 341.88]  Luke with it I get reckless ah window
[341.88 --> 344.16]  delete there we go hub is purely just a
[344.16 --> 345.60]  router not a speaker or a few other
[345.60 --> 346.98]  things people thought it looks kind of
[346.98 --> 349.50]  similar to the looks like Amazon echo yeah
[349.50 --> 351.42]  looks like it could be like the echo
[351.42 --> 354.18]  home interactivity device yes but it's
[354.18 --> 356.64]  super not doesn't work at all in Canada
[356.64 --> 358.20]  which we found out the hard way so
[358.20 --> 360.24]  here's kind of a funny story for
[360.24 --> 362.70]  everyone here and I guess everyone who's
[362.70 --> 364.38]  watching the show since everyone's kind
[364.38 --> 367.38]  of live at the moment I went out of my
[367.38 --> 370.32]  way I got myself a US address to ship it
[370.32 --> 373.02]  to and I bought the remote that goes
[373.02 --> 376.50]  with it I picked up an Amazon echo it sat
[376.50 --> 378.90]  on my table at home for like two weeks
[378.90 --> 381.42]  because I was like the way this has to
[381.42 --> 383.40]  be reviewed is kind of different you
[383.40 --> 384.96]  have to make it part of your life you
[384.96 --> 386.76]  can't just sit in front of it and go
[386.76 --> 390.78]  echo tell me about leopards well it's
[390.78 --> 392.76]  material quality isn't really that great
[392.76 --> 394.50]  I don't know it can work in your computer
[394.50 --> 396.12]  because you're reviewing a lifestyle
[396.12 --> 398.40]  product yeah so I was like Luke I do not
[398.40 --> 400.50]  have time for this can you do the echo he
[400.50 --> 402.24]  goes yeah sure that sounds right up my
[402.24 --> 403.92]  alley and I have a week's vacation and I
[403.92 --> 405.36]  was looking for something to work on from
[405.36 --> 408.48]  work anyway so how'd that go for you it
[408.48 --> 410.64]  doesn't work in Canada it literally only
[410.64 --> 412.32]  works in the States so what I would have
[412.32 --> 414.06]  to do to be able to get it to work is get
[414.06 --> 416.82]  a US registered mobile device and then
[416.82 --> 418.44]  connect to it over Wi-Fi to actually set
[418.44 --> 420.30]  it up the problem with that is I could I
[420.30 --> 421.92]  could like proxy out my router do
[421.92 --> 424.32]  whatever but it has to persistently be
[424.32 --> 426.66]  like that so I'd have to like make my
[426.66 --> 428.16]  router think it was in the States for
[428.16 --> 431.34]  like a month and that doesn't sound fun so
[431.34 --> 433.92]  nope and also it wouldn't be a proper
[433.92 --> 436.08]  fair review either because it's designed
[436.08 --> 438.12]  to work in the States so even if parts of
[438.12 --> 439.32]  it did work it wouldn't be able to
[439.32 --> 441.12]  properly do a lot of its functions yeah
[441.12 --> 443.10]  so I wouldn't be able to properly say
[443.10 --> 444.78]  what the experience was like so that's
[444.78 --> 447.78]  not gonna so we gave up welcome to one of
[447.78 --> 450.54]  the many stupid things that we waste our
[450.54 --> 452.70]  money on and that never even turned into a
[452.70 --> 455.46]  video because yeah we thought hey maybe
[455.46 --> 457.32]  we can a lot of the time we pull this off
[457.32 --> 459.84]  we'll take something that's not gonna work
[459.84 --> 462.06]  and we'll just force it to work and
[462.06 --> 463.80]  we'll and we'll make that stuff happen
[463.80 --> 465.96]  but a lot of the time it just doesn't
[465.96 --> 467.82]  work out here's some cool news though
[467.82 --> 470.04]  the on hub we are definitely going to be
[470.04 --> 471.60]  able to do something with and in fact I
[471.60 --> 472.98]  believe we are going to be getting one of
[472.98 --> 475.92]  the earliest samples oh yeah you didn't
[475.92 --> 477.54]  know that no I didn't know we were
[477.54 --> 478.98]  getting it because not that long ago you
[478.98 --> 480.36]  said we weren't doing routers anymore
[480.36 --> 483.30]  well the thing like a week the thing that
[483.30 --> 485.28]  I'm interested in about this is a couple
[485.28 --> 486.78]  of things number one is why Google
[486.78 --> 488.58]  thinks they need a router at all yeah
[488.58 --> 490.30]  what they believe they bring to the
[490.30 --> 492.72]  table other than sitting between you and
[492.72 --> 494.64]  all of your possible internet traffic
[494.64 --> 497.64]  that they can get whatever it is that
[497.64 --> 500.70]  they want to get out of that hopefully
[500.70 --> 502.32]  they're bringing some kind of a value
[502.32 --> 504.12]  proposition to the table so I want to
[504.12 --> 507.36]  find out what it is yeah and then really
[507.36 --> 510.60]  seem extremely apparent number two is I
[510.60 --> 511.80]  want to have a look at the performance
[511.80 --> 514.56]  because the only thing that jumped into my
[514.56 --> 517.20]  mind that they might think that they add
[517.20 --> 519.62]  to the table is affordable performance
[519.62 --> 521.22]  and two hundred dollars is still an
[521.22 --> 523.50]  expensive router but if they can handle
[523.50 --> 526.68]  full gigabit well yeah which is a
[526.68 --> 528.36]  service they offer to their customers
[528.36 --> 531.78]  then maybe there's a value to it so I
[531.78 --> 534.30]  definitely do want to check it out but I
[534.30 --> 536.56]  don't know how it's going to be
[536.56 --> 537.78]  interesting if you got it at like a
[537.78 --> 539.52]  cheaper cost if you signed up for their
[539.52 --> 541.56]  internet service at the same time I also
[541.56 --> 543.84]  really want to see if they have some
[543.84 --> 546.24]  kind of crazy Wi-Fi technology going on
[546.24 --> 549.00]  inside because as you guys may or may
[549.00 --> 552.18]  not know I'm not a huge fan of anything
[552.18 --> 555.42]  but the best Wi-Fi and the stuff we have
[555.42 --> 557.94]  here thank you for that the stuff we have
[557.94 --> 563.82]  here is almost as good as it gets this
[563.82 --> 567.00]  whole show is as good as it gets
[567.00 --> 570.00]  but it's not the enterprise grade version
[570.00 --> 572.28]  so we've got some stuff from X claim
[572.28 --> 574.92]  which is a daughter company of ruckus
[574.92 --> 577.82]  so if we had ruckus access points which
[577.82 --> 579.42]  their top of the line goes for like a
[579.42 --> 581.70]  thousand bucks a pop you really good
[581.70 --> 584.40]  like they're awesome but no we're not
[584.40 --> 586.56]  putting like four of those in our office
[586.56 --> 588.78]  if we had those we probably could have
[588.78 --> 591.00]  handled everyone's Wi-Fi today but we're
[591.00 --> 595.44]  all on one mid-grade unit today because
[595.44 --> 598.44]  my data terminations are not done in this
[598.44 --> 600.18]  side of the building so I'm supposed to
[600.18 --> 601.92]  have one in each corner of the building
[601.92 --> 604.56]  sort of like it's more complicated than
[604.56 --> 606.00]  that but I'm supposed to have at least
[606.00 --> 607.98]  two at the front here that I was hoping
[607.98 --> 609.72]  people be able to use and I only have one
[609.72 --> 614.52]  that's really in range but I want to see
[614.52 --> 616.86]  what Google has managed to do in terms of
[616.86 --> 618.66]  Wi-Fi so they're saying it's got 13
[618.66 --> 622.32]  antennas inside which would be used for
[622.32 --> 624.84]  beamforming and narrowing in on where
[624.84 --> 626.94]  exactly the devices are and hopefully
[626.94 --> 628.86]  getting better signal out of it I mean
[628.86 --> 630.78]  most companies just do it so poorly
[630.78 --> 633.18]  though that I've kind of given up on
[633.18 --> 635.16]  consumer grade Wi-Fi so if Google can't
[635.16 --> 638.58]  turn me around on this then I guess this is
[638.58 --> 640.56]  things that I actually really like from
[640.56 --> 643.92]  like a family IT dude perspective so if
[643.92 --> 645.36]  you're the IT guy for like your
[645.36 --> 647.34]  immediate family and like your grandma and
[647.34 --> 651.00]  stuff because one of the Google on apps
[651.00 --> 652.86]  that you can have on your phone allows you
[652.86 --> 654.90]  to set up people like a friend to help
[654.90 --> 657.84]  you remotely so if your grandma is like
[657.84 --> 661.14]  my router isn't working I don't have the
[661.14 --> 664.32]  internet you could remotely I go in you
[664.32 --> 665.22]  don't have to go to her house
[665.22 --> 667.76]  necessarily so like if if you should go
[667.76 --> 669.78]  visit your grandma but like if you can't
[669.78 --> 671.28]  for whatever reason she needs to get on
[671.28 --> 673.14]  the internet you can fix it first and
[673.14 --> 674.64]  then you can go hang out with her and
[674.64 --> 677.02]  the internet I think it's kind of cool
[677.02 --> 678.72]  being able to remotely fix things easily
[678.72 --> 680.66]  hang out with the internet yeah I guess
[680.66 --> 682.64]  that's basically you know the internet I
[682.64 --> 684.14]  hang out with the internet all the time
[684.14 --> 686.48]  exactly yeah I never use Google hangouts
[686.48 --> 690.38]  for it though there's also really easy
[690.38 --> 692.36]  setup and whatnot so if you've got a
[692.36 --> 694.52]  buddy who's looking for a router and
[694.52 --> 695.84]  doesn't really know network stuff and
[695.84 --> 697.28]  live super far away from you you can
[697.28 --> 699.62]  suggest this to him maybe maybe it's
[699.62 --> 701.36]  good yeah we gotta find out if it's easy
[701.36 --> 704.78]  everyone is always promising me this
[704.78 --> 706.70]  network attached storage device is easy
[706.70 --> 710.54]  this router is easy I promise this time
[710.54 --> 714.32]  it's easy it's never easy no and one
[714.32 --> 715.40]  thing that's confusing is they're like
[715.40 --> 717.44]  it's easier than one two three
[717.44 --> 719.76]  underscore lowercase c lowercase c
[719.76 --> 722.20]  capital F lowercase j lowercase p
[722.20 --> 725.24]  lowercase x what the hell is that yeah
[725.24 --> 726.62]  that doesn't sound easy at all that's
[726.62 --> 729.08]  right from the on hub page so we are
[729.08 --> 731.60]  we're hoping we're hoping for that's a
[731.60 --> 734.24]  funny joke and Google's actually really
[734.24 --> 737.00]  nailed it this time yeah all right
[737.00 --> 738.44]  didn't have to hire a designer because
[738.44 --> 741.98]  they just copied the echo yeah it looks
[741.98 --> 744.44]  exactly like that oh it just has like a
[744.44 --> 746.30]  little divoted ring on the inside I mean
[746.30 --> 748.58]  in there in there in their defense the
[748.58 --> 752.12]  echo basically just looks like that um
[752.12 --> 756.26]  sorry no well it does look like that
[756.26 --> 757.52]  D-Link router but I was actually
[757.52 --> 760.16]  thinking of Logitech's ultimate ears
[760.16 --> 766.46]  boom so yeah it's like well ours has
[766.46 --> 769.76]  less mesh or something yeah that's
[769.76 --> 772.64]  totally different this is ours it's
[772.64 --> 774.20]  unique it's new it's also has
[774.20 --> 776.30]  networking capability we changed
[776.30 --> 778.70]  everything again it's a slightly
[778.70 --> 781.70]  different cylinder
[782.06 --> 785.60]  okay moving on all right so here's a
[785.60 --> 787.82]  bit of news out of Amazon Jeff Bezos
[787.82 --> 790.44]  says that they will not tolerate
[790.44 --> 793.46]  callous management practices so this
[793.46 --> 795.42]  article is from USA today let's go
[795.42 --> 799.70]  ahead and drop the look at somebody's
[799.70 --> 801.08]  sponsor message something to do with
[801.08 --> 803.36]  weed whacking I'll go ahead and drop the
[803.36 --> 806.60]  the article so some of the more
[806.60 --> 808.70]  memorable loan entire lawn with a
[808.70 --> 809.90]  weed wacker some of the more memorable
[809.90 --> 815.90]  anecdotes I know that it was done once
[815.90 --> 819.32]  ever instead of weekly
[819.32 --> 822.32]  nevermind continue
[822.32 --> 826.16]  so here so just basically the question
[826.16 --> 827.90]  the article asks is can I continue to
[827.90 --> 830.72]  support Amazon with my money and there
[830.72 --> 832.28]  are some anecdotes about you know
[832.28 --> 834.20]  working conditions at Amazon woman who
[834.20 --> 835.88]  had just lost a child in pregnancy was
[835.88 --> 837.98]  put on performance review for not giving
[837.98 --> 840.38]  her all to the company apparently emails
[840.38 --> 842.18]  are sent out at all hours miss the
[842.18 --> 844.34]  midnight email you get a text message a
[844.34 --> 845.78]  few minutes later asking why you
[845.78 --> 848.10]  haven't replied daily performance
[848.10 --> 850.10]  reviews are apparently standard giving
[850.10 --> 851.42]  opportunities the opportunity are
[851.42 --> 852.90]  giving employees the opportunity to
[852.90 --> 854.42]  chime in and tear down others
[854.42 --> 857.10]  anonymously so you know some of these
[857.10 --> 860.18]  things are kind of you know not to not
[860.18 --> 861.96]  too great so this was an expose done by
[861.96 --> 866.42]  the New York Times I mean there's some
[866.42 --> 868.40]  stuff here that's like quite frankly I
[868.40 --> 871.64]  send out emails at all times of night in
[871.64 --> 875.24]  fact I have now officially sent out an
[875.24 --> 877.88]  email at night after hours asking for a
[877.88 --> 881.30]  reply at night after hours but it was
[881.30 --> 883.34]  for their benefit it was so that I
[883.34 --> 886.08]  wouldn't fire them
[886.08 --> 889.40]  I sent you a hangouts at like 11 45
[889.40 --> 890.90]  yesterday it was but it was for their
[890.90 --> 892.88]  benefit I actually gave the employees a
[892.88 --> 894.44]  bit of an early crack at the garage sale
[894.44 --> 896.42]  items so I told them I needed to know
[896.42 --> 897.98]  what they wanted before we did the
[897.98 --> 900.02]  garage sale today so and I do send
[900.02 --> 901.94]  emails all times of night but I generally
[901.94 --> 904.82]  don't expect a reply until until the
[904.82 --> 909.44]  morning so Amazon's founder says he
[909.44 --> 912.74]  doesn't recognize the company described
[912.74 --> 915.40]  refers to shockingly callous management
[915.40 --> 917.96]  practices and urges employees to contact
[917.96 --> 921.08]  HR or even him if any situation like
[921.08 --> 923.78]  that has occurred he says even if it's
[923.78 --> 925.52]  rare isolated our tolerance for such a
[925.52 --> 928.94]  lack of empathy needs to be zero so at the
[928.94 --> 930.26]  very least they're dealing with it
[930.26 --> 931.76]  internally I mean this is something that
[931.76 --> 934.94]  is really good for me to hear because as
[934.94 --> 936.86]  many of our viewers know we do a shout
[936.86 --> 938.94]  out to shop on Amazon at the end of
[938.94 --> 944.42]  almost all of our videos and we are like a
[944.42 --> 947.24]  major Amazon affiliate partner that's
[947.24 --> 950.36]  that's a that's a huge huge that's been a
[950.36 --> 952.52]  huge helper for us over the last couple of
[952.52 --> 955.82]  years since we started doing it so for me to
[955.82 --> 958.82]  you know find out that the company that I
[958.82 --> 960.26]  don't know if a lot of people know this
[960.26 --> 961.82]  but if you're in a particularly
[961.82 --> 963.32]  charitable mood and you're buying
[963.32 --> 964.88]  something on Amazon you don't have to
[964.88 --> 967.22]  use our affiliate code they've also got
[967.22 --> 969.14]  their what's that program called
[969.14 --> 972.56]  smile right yes smile yeah Amazon smile
[972.56 --> 974.12]  where they'll actually contribute it to
[974.12 --> 975.68]  smaller percentage than they give a
[975.68 --> 977.90]  affiliate you can do both can you do both
[977.90 --> 979.70]  I think you do smile dot because it's
[979.70 --> 982.04]  smile dot and then the tag is at the end
[982.04 --> 983.66]  oh I'm pretty sure you can do both at
[983.66 --> 985.58]  any rate you know if you guys are
[985.58 --> 987.14]  looking for a way to contribute to a
[987.14 --> 988.70]  charity of your choice you can actually
[988.70 --> 990.74]  pick your charity and use smile to
[990.74 --> 992.12]  donate I think it's one or one and a
[992.12 --> 993.92]  half percent or something like that of
[993.92 --> 995.78]  your purchase value so you know they
[995.78 --> 999.62]  seem like pretty good guys it seemed
[999.62 --> 1002.26]  like a safe thing for us to call out all
[1002.26 --> 1003.94]  the time you hear this stuff about valve
[1003.94 --> 1006.28]  and everybody yeah yeah I mean there was
[1006.28 --> 1008.14]  that big there was that big thing with
[1008.14 --> 1010.66]  valve employees sort of you know blowing the
[1010.66 --> 1012.52]  lid off of you know you think it isn't as
[1012.52 --> 1014.08]  flat of a structure as you think it is
[1014.08 --> 1015.76]  and it's just a boys club and like all
[1015.76 --> 1016.72]  this kind of stuff like this this
[1016.72 --> 1018.76]  happens from every company it might be
[1018.76 --> 1021.58]  true to a certain degree I'm sure a lot
[1021.58 --> 1023.54]  of it is true to a certain degree but
[1023.54 --> 1026.50]  it's probably exaggerated when told in
[1026.50 --> 1027.88]  an interview yeah I mean you always need
[1027.88 --> 1032.42]  to get both sides of any story so okay
[1032.42 --> 1036.76]  Bitcoin could split in a debate over the
[1036.76 --> 1039.52]  currencies future but not dogecoin right
[1039.52 --> 1042.04]  yeah we gotta get hold on we gotta get
[1042.04 --> 1044.32]  our buddy with the dogecoin shirt pimp in
[1044.32 --> 1047.80]  the dogecoin come on come on dogecoin is
[1047.80 --> 1053.20]  united dogecoin will never fail yes go up a
[1053.20 --> 1054.94]  little bit go up a little bit yeah there you go
[1054.94 --> 1067.54]  yeah yeah yeah dogecoin so our article here is from the BBC I love that shirt
[1067.54 --> 1075.16]  yeah it's great go away it needs more doge meme on it though um so there you go remember guys
[1075.16 --> 1084.74]  physical Bitcoin coins are not actually necessarily a thing it's all digital but some people did make them for lols and you know people
[1084.74 --> 1094.54]  gathered them or something um so basically what's going down is there's two sides to Bitcoin so there's Bitcoin core the original and
[1094.54 --> 1107.34]  wait hold on a second okay so they're on the side of increasing wallet size Bitcoin XT which is a slight variation is lightweight wallets so
[1107.34 --> 1114.06]  Bitcoin's creator said in 2010 it would be nice to keep the blockchain file small as long as we can
[1114.06 --> 1126.34]  um the eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets when I eventually implemented client only mode that won't matter much anymore but in recent months it's become clear that a small group of people have a radically different plan for Bitcoin and that's Bitcoin XT
[1126.34 --> 1156.32]  I mean what if people couldn't run Bitcoin on their home computers anymore I mean what if people couldn't run Bitcoin on their home computers anymore so some of the changes that they want our networks of payment routing hubs or something along those lines a sharp rise in fees they want to end support for mobile P2P wallets and give up on unconfirmed transactions so it's unknown if people would migrate I mean I think the whole digital currency thing continues to be what it is it's a small group of people have a radically different plan for Bitcoin and that's Bitcoin XT
[1156.32 --> 1159.46]  unproven until
[1159.46 --> 1161.02]  except for Dogecoin
[1161.02 --> 1163.38]  except for Dogecoin
[1163.38 --> 1165.40]  in which we all trust
[1165.40 --> 1165.80]  yes
[1165.80 --> 1169.32]  the limit of the current system will
[1169.32 --> 1170.90]  allegedly be reached by 2017
[1170.90 --> 1173.26]  so we've still got a year
[1173.26 --> 1175.30]  plus to figure out how this is all going
[1175.30 --> 1176.90]  to go down but
[1176.90 --> 1178.06]  you know
[1178.06 --> 1181.42]  I guess the thing that I don't really see
[1181.42 --> 1182.96]  as any different
[1182.96 --> 1184.80]  really here is
[1184.80 --> 1186.98]  it's yet another competing cryptocurrency
[1186.98 --> 1189.58]  so there you go
[1189.58 --> 1191.10]  and they're all failing and honestly
[1191.10 --> 1193.38]  Bitcoin hasn't really been doing that great lately
[1193.38 --> 1193.72]  either
[1193.72 --> 1196.86]  I mean it had to settle down
[1196.86 --> 1198.72]  the gold rush couldn't go on forever
[1198.72 --> 1201.38]  but I kind of hoped that it would
[1201.38 --> 1203.42]  ride long enough that people would
[1203.42 --> 1204.28]  actually care
[1204.28 --> 1207.58]  because there's a problem
[1207.58 --> 1209.48]  with it's hard to spend in a lot of
[1209.48 --> 1211.42]  different places like someone here was like why don't you accept
[1211.42 --> 1213.42]  Bitcoin and I was like well because it would
[1213.42 --> 1215.88]  have taken a little bit to set up because none of us have wallets
[1215.88 --> 1217.70]  except for me and you don't want them to give me money
[1217.70 --> 1219.66]  I wish you did
[1219.66 --> 1221.36]  but it doesn't work like that at companies
[1221.36 --> 1223.12]  well it's also complicated because
[1223.12 --> 1225.48]  then that would be personal income
[1225.48 --> 1226.26]  to you
[1226.26 --> 1226.78]  yeah
[1226.78 --> 1227.52]  which then
[1227.52 --> 1229.02]  well we could set you up a wallet
[1229.02 --> 1229.80]  it wouldn't be that hard
[1229.80 --> 1231.78]  but then like there's gonna be like two people that use it
[1231.78 --> 1232.88]  and then you guys have to convert it
[1232.88 --> 1233.96]  and if you take a while to convert it
[1233.96 --> 1235.34]  and it falls and it's worth less money
[1235.34 --> 1235.62]  and then
[1235.62 --> 1239.62]  I mean it's one of those things we've meant to kind of do forever
[1239.62 --> 1240.58]  but
[1240.58 --> 1244.14]  it's just easier to not
[1244.14 --> 1244.84]  I mean honestly
[1244.84 --> 1246.20]  I
[1246.20 --> 1249.16]  I hashtag got wrecked
[1249.16 --> 1251.58]  by the Bitcoin gold rush
[1251.58 --> 1251.90]  because
[1251.90 --> 1254.24]  back when I was working at NCIX
[1254.24 --> 1254.80]  like
[1254.80 --> 1256.88]  I had access to
[1256.88 --> 1259.56]  even though I didn't really like have my own building to store it in
[1259.56 --> 1261.34]  and it wasn't like all like mine sort of
[1261.34 --> 1262.94]  but I had access to
[1262.94 --> 1264.34]  all kinds of
[1264.34 --> 1265.40]  awesome
[1265.40 --> 1266.34]  gear
[1266.34 --> 1269.98]  like back when Bitcoins were pretty easy to mine
[1269.98 --> 1271.52]  and it was just taking off
[1271.52 --> 1275.36]  and I actually went and I set up a mining rig
[1275.36 --> 1276.96]  and I was just like
[1276.96 --> 1279.06]  hey well I could set it up at the office
[1279.06 --> 1281.76]  and we'll make like a tech tips about it
[1281.76 --> 1283.62]  and I'll just get my boss's permission
[1283.62 --> 1286.20]  so I literally wouldn't have been paying for hardware
[1286.20 --> 1289.04]  wouldn't have been paying for electricity even
[1289.04 --> 1290.64]  and could have mined myself
[1290.64 --> 1292.00]  a whack ton of Bitcoins
[1292.00 --> 1292.94]  because I had probably
[1292.94 --> 1295.10]  a dozen to two dozen graphics cards
[1295.10 --> 1297.02]  and test benches to match
[1297.02 --> 1298.96]  could have just filled that crap up
[1298.96 --> 1300.74]  like before people started
[1300.74 --> 1303.04]  you know covering walls in their garages
[1303.04 --> 1304.54]  with Bitcoin mining rigs
[1304.54 --> 1305.52]  and
[1305.52 --> 1307.50]  I like
[1307.50 --> 1308.66]  I like
[1308.66 --> 1310.60]  got like a bad stick of RAM
[1310.60 --> 1312.42]  in the test bench
[1312.42 --> 1313.30]  or something
[1313.30 --> 1314.02]  and like
[1314.02 --> 1315.22]  something something
[1315.22 --> 1316.12]  and I just got lazy
[1316.12 --> 1316.98]  and I was like ask for it
[1316.98 --> 1318.90]  that would have been huge
[1318.90 --> 1319.48]  because he's right
[1319.48 --> 1320.82]  it was right before
[1320.82 --> 1322.72]  the first big boom
[1322.72 --> 1323.54]  where it jumped up to like
[1323.54 --> 1323.94]  what was it
[1323.94 --> 1325.20]  250 bucks or something
[1325.20 --> 1327.08]  so they were still worth almost nothing
[1327.08 --> 1327.84]  and mining them
[1327.84 --> 1329.30]  you got a ton back then
[1329.30 --> 1330.60]  so he would have got like
[1330.60 --> 1331.98]  I could have probably made
[1331.98 --> 1333.88]  tens and tens of thousands of dollars
[1333.88 --> 1334.18]  yeah
[1334.18 --> 1334.80]  like actually
[1334.80 --> 1336.56]  so I don't reject Bitcoin
[1336.56 --> 1338.10]  because I'm bitter though
[1338.10 --> 1342.84]  but I am a little bitter
[1342.84 --> 1345.50]  it's just not why I don't bother with it
[1345.50 --> 1346.36]  I don't bother with it
[1346.36 --> 1347.22]  for the same reasons
[1347.22 --> 1348.44]  that I never bothered with it
[1348.44 --> 1350.82]  I'm just clearly short-sighted
[1350.82 --> 1351.90]  it's cool
[1351.90 --> 1352.34]  it's just
[1352.34 --> 1353.00]  yeah
[1353.00 --> 1354.10]  I think cryptocurrency
[1354.10 --> 1356.04]  will totally be a thing at some point
[1356.04 --> 1357.26]  I just think it's not right now
[1357.26 --> 1357.60]  yeah
[1357.60 --> 1359.12]  I mean the good news is that
[1359.12 --> 1361.16]  some more forward-thinking companies
[1361.16 --> 1362.10]  are at least
[1362.10 --> 1364.44]  trying to adapt their laws
[1364.44 --> 1365.50]  to account for it
[1365.50 --> 1367.60]  others are just completely ignoring it
[1367.60 --> 1368.66]  we'll see how that goes for them
[1368.66 --> 1369.76]  but
[1369.76 --> 1371.86]  yeah
[1371.86 --> 1373.82]  so let's move on to our next topic I guess
[1373.82 --> 1375.66]  oh poor Twitch chat
[1375.66 --> 1377.94]  I am ignoring them even more than usual
[1377.94 --> 1381.78]  everyone's posting salt emojis
[1381.78 --> 1382.72]  it's because you're
[1382.72 --> 1383.20]  oh
[1383.20 --> 1384.72]  me
[1384.72 --> 1386.12]  it makes a ton of sense
[1386.12 --> 1386.98]  yes it does
[1386.98 --> 1388.22]  thanks for that Twitch chat
[1388.22 --> 1388.38]  you're salty
[1388.38 --> 1390.12]  every single time
[1390.12 --> 1391.66]  I'm like you know
[1391.66 --> 1394.54]  I haven't been paying enough attention to Twitch chat
[1394.54 --> 1396.52]  let's give Twitch chat some love
[1396.52 --> 1399.48]  they make me regret it
[1399.48 --> 1400.56]  every time
[1400.56 --> 1401.78]  every time
[1401.78 --> 1403.56]  let's let them down Twitch chat
[1403.56 --> 1405.68]  alright
[1405.68 --> 1407.60]  so I'm just gonna post our
[1407.60 --> 1408.42]  I got this one
[1408.42 --> 1409.08]  oh I
[1409.08 --> 1409.96]  oh
[1409.96 --> 1411.06]  did you do it already?
[1411.20 --> 1412.24]  it's sitting right there
[1412.24 --> 1414.06]  you were ready
[1414.06 --> 1414.64]  rude
[1414.64 --> 1416.26]  the one time I'm ready
[1416.26 --> 1419.42]  research lab goof
[1419.42 --> 1422.34]  results in four times longer
[1422.34 --> 1425.10]  lithium ion battery working life
[1425.10 --> 1428.28]  so some scientists at Tsinghua University in Beijing
[1428.28 --> 1431.22]  and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston
[1431.22 --> 1436.22]  have been working on techniques to extend the working life of lithium ion batteries
[1436.22 --> 1436.98]  now to be clear
[1436.98 --> 1444.06]  this particular research is not to make your phone last for you know three or four days
[1444.06 --> 1450.22]  this particular technology is to make the battery last for enough recharge cycles
[1450.22 --> 1453.02]  that you can keep it for longer than a couple of years
[1453.02 --> 1455.72]  so this is cool
[1455.72 --> 1458.26]  because basically what happened
[1458.26 --> 1462.44]  is they were working on making the anodes of the battery more durable
[1462.44 --> 1465.10]  because that's the part that decays the fastest
[1465.10 --> 1468.66]  and that's why after a few hundred charge cycles
[1468.66 --> 1471.02]  you see a really sharp drop off
[1471.02 --> 1471.74]  and all of a sudden
[1471.74 --> 1474.32]  you know it's two o'clock
[1474.32 --> 1476.84]  and you're at you know 40% battery life
[1476.84 --> 1478.06]  that's why that happens
[1478.06 --> 1479.36]  oh and there's a train
[1479.36 --> 1480.24]  rude
[1480.24 --> 1482.24]  so rude
[1482.24 --> 1488.82]  thank you
[1488.82 --> 1489.18]  thank you
[1489.18 --> 1490.22]  I wonder what that sounds like
[1490.22 --> 1490.68]  thank you
[1490.68 --> 1492.58]  we can hear you
[1492.58 --> 1493.88]  everything is good
[1493.88 --> 1496.68]  oh this was for you
[1496.68 --> 1497.98]  I was supposed to throw it at you
[1497.98 --> 1498.18]  oh
[1498.18 --> 1499.88]  no this is mine
[1499.88 --> 1500.06]  yeah
[1500.06 --> 1501.08]  oh okay
[1501.08 --> 1503.96]  yay
[1503.96 --> 1504.92]  that was
[1504.92 --> 1505.24]  yeah
[1505.24 --> 1505.74]  yeah
[1505.74 --> 1506.94]  you armed us both
[1506.94 --> 1508.34]  that's weird
[1508.34 --> 1510.68]  all right
[1510.68 --> 1511.54]  so basically
[1511.54 --> 1513.50]  a batch of anodes
[1513.50 --> 1515.20]  was left under chemical treatment
[1515.20 --> 1516.98]  for several hours more
[1516.98 --> 1518.54]  than they should have
[1518.54 --> 1519.94]  completely by accident
[1519.94 --> 1521.00]  and remember guys
[1521.00 --> 1522.90]  when you're doing lab work
[1522.90 --> 1524.62]  you're often working with chemicals
[1524.62 --> 1525.50]  and like
[1525.50 --> 1526.78]  engineering
[1526.78 --> 1527.46]  like
[1527.46 --> 1530.56]  pre-engineering sample grade hardware
[1530.56 --> 1533.60]  that is unbelievably expensive to produce
[1533.60 --> 1533.84]  I mean
[1533.84 --> 1535.26]  you guys have no idea
[1535.26 --> 1537.78]  even something as simple and stupid
[1537.78 --> 1539.16]  as a computer case
[1539.16 --> 1541.54]  and I don't mean computer cases are stupid
[1541.54 --> 1542.54]  I mean
[1542.54 --> 1543.74]  they're made of materials
[1543.74 --> 1545.32]  we basically understand
[1545.32 --> 1547.40]  you got a plastic bezel
[1547.40 --> 1549.36]  you got your steel chassis
[1549.36 --> 1550.82]  you fold it up
[1550.82 --> 1551.90]  pretty much
[1551.90 --> 1552.20]  right
[1552.20 --> 1553.92]  I mean we're not talking
[1553.92 --> 1556.68]  we want the battery to last for four times longer
[1556.68 --> 1558.58]  we're going to completely re-engineer a new
[1558.58 --> 1559.58]  a new compound
[1559.58 --> 1560.58]  so
[1560.58 --> 1562.14]  the stuff they're working with
[1562.14 --> 1563.40]  is expensive
[1563.40 --> 1566.66]  to screw up a batch
[1566.66 --> 1568.44]  could cost hundreds
[1568.44 --> 1570.38]  or maybe thousands
[1570.38 --> 1572.36]  or even tens of thousands of dollars
[1572.36 --> 1573.74]  depending on what they're working on
[1573.74 --> 1574.58]  so
[1574.58 --> 1575.88]  instead of throwing them away
[1575.88 --> 1577.10]  you know
[1577.10 --> 1579.48]  someone probably got a slap on the wrist
[1579.48 --> 1580.88]  but they decided to test them
[1580.88 --> 1582.94]  and the results were great
[1582.94 --> 1584.88]  four times more durable
[1584.88 --> 1586.06]  than the current
[1586.06 --> 1588.36]  best available technology
[1588.36 --> 1590.58]  so they've been working on using aluminum
[1590.58 --> 1592.04]  in preference to graphite
[1592.04 --> 1593.72]  it expands and contracts more
[1593.72 --> 1594.38]  so in effect
[1594.38 --> 1595.30]  these cells
[1595.30 --> 1596.00]  let me get this right
[1596.00 --> 1597.20]  they can't just fold the metal
[1597.20 --> 1598.68]  fold the metal
[1598.68 --> 1599.04]  no
[1599.04 --> 1600.32]  no this is not
[1600.32 --> 1601.50]  a computer case
[1601.50 --> 1601.80]  okay
[1601.80 --> 1602.66]  I just need to make sure
[1602.66 --> 1603.54]  they can't just fold the metal
[1603.54 --> 1604.46]  to be very clear
[1604.46 --> 1606.98]  they can't just injection mold the plastic
[1606.98 --> 1608.26]  and then fold the metal
[1608.26 --> 1609.14]  and then fold the metal
[1609.14 --> 1610.12]  on the other side
[1610.12 --> 1610.32]  alright
[1610.32 --> 1611.02]  cool
[1611.02 --> 1613.60]  so basically
[1613.60 --> 1616.36]  so by soaking it
[1616.36 --> 1617.38]  in sulfuric acid
[1617.38 --> 1619.12]  and titanium oxysulfate
[1619.12 --> 1621.14]  which replaces the aluminum oxide
[1621.14 --> 1622.70]  from the aluminum being exposed
[1622.70 --> 1624.18]  I don't know if you guys know this
[1624.18 --> 1625.46]  aluminum rust is white
[1625.46 --> 1626.80]  and it oxidizes
[1626.80 --> 1627.78]  almost immediately
[1627.78 --> 1628.54]  that's why most people
[1628.54 --> 1629.18]  don't even know
[1629.18 --> 1630.16]  that aluminum rusts
[1630.16 --> 1631.06]  if you polish it
[1631.06 --> 1632.26]  and clear coat it
[1632.26 --> 1633.86]  you can actually make
[1633.86 --> 1635.04]  a very efficient mirror
[1635.04 --> 1635.62]  out of aluminum
[1635.62 --> 1636.72]  very interesting
[1636.72 --> 1637.64]  stupid fact
[1637.64 --> 1638.46]  that no one cares about
[1638.46 --> 1640.96]  but the reason it always looks like rubbish
[1640.96 --> 1642.30]  is because it oxidizes
[1642.30 --> 1643.66]  almost immediately
[1643.66 --> 1646.16]  just from being exposed to open air
[1646.16 --> 1647.66]  so pretty much
[1647.66 --> 1648.20]  it's
[1648.20 --> 1650.12]  it has a much more conductive
[1650.12 --> 1651.46]  titanium oxide coating
[1651.46 --> 1652.24]  effectively now
[1652.24 --> 1653.08]  which provided
[1653.08 --> 1655.14]  exactly the desired results
[1655.14 --> 1656.62]  completely by accident
[1656.62 --> 1660.16]  very very cool
[1660.16 --> 1660.70]  so epic
[1660.70 --> 1661.72]  awesome stuff
[1661.72 --> 1662.28]  that guy
[1662.28 --> 1663.28]  instead of getting fired
[1663.28 --> 1664.16]  got a promotion
[1664.16 --> 1665.40]  hooray
[1665.40 --> 1666.28]  maybe he got fired
[1666.28 --> 1667.26]  and then a promotion
[1667.26 --> 1668.20]  that would be awesome
[1668.20 --> 1669.54]  well you've been fired
[1669.54 --> 1670.20]  lots of times
[1670.20 --> 1671.06]  I'm sure I've promoted you
[1671.06 --> 1671.62]  at some point
[1671.62 --> 1671.96]  yep
[1671.96 --> 1673.80]  now we have a pretty flat structure
[1673.80 --> 1675.22]  I know from first hand experience
[1675.22 --> 1675.98]  that it's awesome
[1675.98 --> 1676.92]  it's awesome
[1676.92 --> 1680.40]  ah so LG's new Nexus 5
[1680.40 --> 1681.26]  has leaked
[1681.26 --> 1681.80]  I guess
[1681.80 --> 1682.90]  Google has
[1682.90 --> 1684.32]  heard our cries
[1684.32 --> 1686.76]  about the Nexus 6
[1686.76 --> 1688.40]  not being a Nexus 5
[1688.40 --> 1689.66]  wait
[1689.66 --> 1691.16]  what's the stupid thing called
[1691.16 --> 1692.18]  is it even called
[1692.18 --> 1692.82]  the Nexus 6
[1692.82 --> 1693.46]  I don't know
[1693.46 --> 1695.20]  that phone that I didn't care about
[1695.20 --> 1695.82]  that I reviewed
[1695.82 --> 1696.16]  yeah
[1696.16 --> 1697.44]  it is the Nexus 6
[1697.44 --> 1697.72]  right
[1697.72 --> 1698.94]  the one that was too big
[1698.94 --> 1700.56]  their numbers are just bad
[1700.56 --> 1702.06]  and they should probably feel bad
[1702.06 --> 1702.90]  so it's fine
[1702.90 --> 1703.94]  they should just call it
[1703.94 --> 1704.54]  I don't even know
[1704.54 --> 1705.08]  I don't even know
[1705.08 --> 1706.06]  what they would call it
[1706.06 --> 1706.38]  because you
[1706.38 --> 1707.14]  anyway
[1707.14 --> 1708.08]  the point is
[1708.08 --> 1709.30]  they heard us
[1709.30 --> 1711.72]  we don't all want a huge phone
[1711.72 --> 1712.88]  some of us have
[1712.88 --> 1714.16]  tiny hands
[1714.16 --> 1716.66]  some of us don't
[1716.66 --> 1721.68]  to be fair though
[1721.68 --> 1722.54]  I don't even like phones
[1722.54 --> 1723.34]  that are that huge
[1723.34 --> 1725.26]  what is
[1725.26 --> 1726.18]  let me see
[1726.18 --> 1727.24]  like my G3
[1727.24 --> 1728.12]  which is not on me
[1728.12 --> 1728.70]  because it's charging
[1728.70 --> 1730.44]  is like borderline too large
[1730.44 --> 1731.42]  not because I don't like
[1731.42 --> 1732.02]  the big screen
[1732.02 --> 1732.90]  but because most of the time
[1732.90 --> 1734.04]  I'm just typing on it anyways
[1734.04 --> 1734.80]  you mean Z3
[1734.80 --> 1735.62]  yes
[1735.62 --> 1736.14]  Z3
[1736.14 --> 1736.44]  sorry
[1736.44 --> 1737.44]  neither of us are
[1737.44 --> 1738.38]  you said G3
[1738.38 --> 1739.54]  which is a phone
[1739.54 --> 1740.84]  that you did have at one point
[1740.84 --> 1741.94]  and I don't anymore
[1741.94 --> 1742.86]  I have the G2
[1742.86 --> 1743.36]  yeah
[1743.36 --> 1744.14]  anyways
[1744.14 --> 1745.50]  and being able to type on it
[1745.50 --> 1746.34]  with one hand is helpful
[1746.34 --> 1747.18]  I can do that
[1747.18 --> 1748.06]  with the Z3
[1748.06 --> 1749.12]  but it's easier
[1749.12 --> 1750.32]  on a slightly smaller phone
[1750.32 --> 1751.04]  so there you go
[1751.04 --> 1752.46]  a tweet from our
[1752.46 --> 1753.66]  our main man
[1753.66 --> 1755.36]  over at MKBHD
[1755.36 --> 1756.94]  I mean can we really say
[1756.94 --> 1758.10]  he's at MKBHD
[1758.10 --> 1758.94]  he is on Twitter
[1758.94 --> 1760.46]  but do you really
[1760.46 --> 1761.64]  do you really work at
[1761.64 --> 1763.10]  MKBHD
[1763.10 --> 1764.26]  isn't that his thing now
[1764.26 --> 1764.92]  he's like
[1764.92 --> 1765.94]  he's one guy though
[1765.94 --> 1766.24]  doesn't
[1766.24 --> 1766.54]  but yeah
[1766.54 --> 1768.04]  but doesn't he run MKBHD
[1768.04 --> 1769.24]  isn't that actually his thing
[1769.24 --> 1769.26]  yeah
[1769.26 --> 1770.26]  so he's
[1770.26 --> 1771.24]  so Marcus
[1771.24 --> 1772.58]  from MKBHD
[1772.58 --> 1773.04]  sure why not
[1773.04 --> 1773.50]  the guy
[1773.50 --> 1774.32]  yeah Marcus
[1774.32 --> 1774.86]  the one
[1774.86 --> 1775.60]  so basically
[1775.60 --> 1776.52]  it looks like
[1776.52 --> 1777.06]  it's gonna have
[1777.06 --> 1777.96]  a camera bump
[1777.96 --> 1779.06]  it looks like
[1779.06 --> 1779.62]  it's gonna say
[1779.62 --> 1780.62]  Nexus on the back
[1780.62 --> 1782.02]  I hope they remove
[1782.02 --> 1783.44]  this not for sale printing
[1783.44 --> 1784.88]  that's really an eyesore
[1784.88 --> 1786.24]  I like it
[1786.24 --> 1786.92]  you like it
[1786.92 --> 1787.42]  because you know what
[1787.42 --> 1788.50]  my phone isn't for sale
[1788.50 --> 1789.40]  I don't want you
[1789.40 --> 1790.24]  to have my personal information
[1790.24 --> 1790.78]  I don't want you
[1790.78 --> 1791.34]  to buy my phone
[1791.34 --> 1792.50]  I don't know
[1792.50 --> 1793.52]  if I put my phone down
[1793.52 --> 1794.98]  at like Starbucks
[1794.98 --> 1795.66]  I don't want someone
[1795.66 --> 1795.98]  to be like
[1795.98 --> 1796.74]  yo can I buy it
[1796.74 --> 1797.90]  yeah but I don't think
[1797.90 --> 1798.70]  Google's were gonna be
[1798.70 --> 1799.42]  down with that
[1799.42 --> 1800.24]  because everything
[1800.24 --> 1801.00]  on your phone
[1801.00 --> 1804.42]  it's ours
[1804.42 --> 1805.78]  good point
[1805.78 --> 1806.10]  alright
[1806.10 --> 1808.86]  maybe they don't want me
[1808.86 --> 1809.20]  to sell it
[1809.20 --> 1809.64]  because they want
[1809.64 --> 1810.36]  to keep harvesting
[1810.36 --> 1811.40]  maybe that's what's
[1811.40 --> 1812.18]  special about it
[1812.18 --> 1813.06]  just for Marques
[1813.06 --> 1813.68]  he was like
[1813.68 --> 1814.18]  look
[1814.18 --> 1816.24]  I'll review the new
[1816.24 --> 1817.22]  Nexus 5
[1817.22 --> 1819.02]  but you can't have
[1819.02 --> 1819.66]  my data
[1819.66 --> 1821.50]  I want it right
[1821.50 --> 1822.12]  on the phone
[1822.12 --> 1823.54]  not for sale
[1823.54 --> 1826.72]  this is only mine
[1826.72 --> 1828.10]  speaking of not for sale
[1828.10 --> 1830.60]  spots on our show
[1830.60 --> 1832.70]  are for sale
[1832.70 --> 1833.60]  yay
[1833.60 --> 1834.82]  if you're
[1834.82 --> 1835.54]  Squarespace
[1835.54 --> 1836.86]  yay
[1836.86 --> 1837.50]  feel the beautiful
[1837.50 --> 1838.44]  yes
[1838.44 --> 1839.30]  thank you
[1839.30 --> 1840.80]  that is their slogan
[1840.80 --> 1842.36]  for the last time
[1842.36 --> 1842.68]  okay
[1842.68 --> 1843.60]  I have to make sure
[1843.60 --> 1844.62]  that every single person
[1844.62 --> 1845.38]  that ever watches
[1845.38 --> 1845.82]  the WAN show
[1845.82 --> 1846.38]  knows
[1846.38 --> 1847.80]  I should just say it
[1847.80 --> 1849.10]  as the opening line now
[1849.10 --> 1850.18]  of the WAN show
[1850.18 --> 1851.32]  hey it's gonna be a good show
[1851.32 --> 1851.72]  and I'll be like
[1851.72 --> 1852.26]  build it beautiful
[1852.26 --> 1853.20]  so when Squarespace
[1853.20 --> 1854.32]  isn't even a sponsor
[1854.32 --> 1854.90]  you're just gonna
[1854.90 --> 1856.28]  go and do it
[1856.28 --> 1858.64]  okay
[1858.64 --> 1859.40]  so
[1859.40 --> 1860.68]  Squarespace
[1860.68 --> 1862.42]  if you guys are watching
[1862.42 --> 1863.54]  and I'm pretty sure you are
[1863.54 --> 1864.56]  our Squarespace contact
[1864.56 --> 1865.80]  legit watches the show
[1865.80 --> 1866.58]  which I discovered
[1866.58 --> 1867.84]  when we had that
[1867.84 --> 1869.18]  phenomenally embarrassing
[1869.18 --> 1869.88]  situation
[1869.88 --> 1871.60]  where Luke told me
[1871.60 --> 1872.66]  his mom's site
[1872.66 --> 1873.84]  was hosted on Squarespace
[1873.84 --> 1876.34]  so we had the entire
[1876.34 --> 1878.04]  WAN show audience
[1878.04 --> 1879.72]  hit it all at the same time
[1879.72 --> 1881.16]  it goes down
[1881.16 --> 1882.82]  and it's hosted on like
[1882.82 --> 1883.96]  dog hosting
[1883.96 --> 1885.28]  or some stupid thing
[1885.28 --> 1887.10]  and it's down
[1887.10 --> 1887.88]  and I'm like
[1887.88 --> 1889.06]  you have got
[1889.06 --> 1889.80]  I don't care
[1889.80 --> 1891.00]  whatever it is
[1891.00 --> 1892.04]  it's some kind of animal
[1892.04 --> 1893.36]  that doesn't work hard enough
[1893.36 --> 1894.68]  so
[1894.68 --> 1898.26]  he was super unhappy
[1898.26 --> 1900.64]  and they were watching
[1900.64 --> 1902.34]  and I was like
[1902.34 --> 1903.68]  no you gotta be kidding me
[1903.68 --> 1904.20]  so Squarespace
[1904.20 --> 1904.92]  if you're watching
[1904.92 --> 1906.24]  can you get a new slogan
[1906.24 --> 1907.48]  maybe just for us
[1907.48 --> 1908.58]  so he can shut up
[1908.58 --> 1909.20]  with the build it beautiful thing
[1909.20 --> 1910.18]  they should make it
[1910.18 --> 1911.00]  build it more beautiful
[1911.00 --> 1911.36]  but the
[1911.36 --> 1915.40]  so
[1915.40 --> 1916.82]  I mean that is it
[1916.82 --> 1917.36]  in a nutshell
[1917.36 --> 1917.86]  Squarespace
[1917.86 --> 1918.66]  build it beautiful
[1918.66 --> 1919.38]  they're all about
[1919.38 --> 1920.86]  people making beautiful websites
[1920.86 --> 1922.04]  and putting them on the internet
[1922.04 --> 1923.82]  with their tools
[1923.82 --> 1925.22]  and their website hosting
[1925.22 --> 1925.94]  it comes in
[1925.94 --> 1927.04]  affordable plans
[1927.04 --> 1927.86]  all the way up to
[1927.86 --> 1929.38]  pretty darn beefy plans
[1929.38 --> 1931.24]  you pick from one of their templates
[1931.24 --> 1932.24]  you can make a blog
[1932.24 --> 1933.12]  you can make a
[1933.12 --> 1934.10]  you know portfolio
[1934.10 --> 1935.02]  you can make
[1935.02 --> 1935.82]  oh I don't know
[1935.82 --> 1937.82]  an informational site
[1937.82 --> 1938.74]  about you know
[1938.74 --> 1939.30]  your company
[1939.30 --> 1940.94]  like linusmediagroup.com
[1940.94 --> 1941.92]  where all these people
[1941.92 --> 1943.16]  found our address presumably
[1943.16 --> 1943.84]  to come and
[1943.84 --> 1944.92]  hang out with us
[1944.92 --> 1946.12]  at this live meetup
[1946.12 --> 1947.34]  also there was a link
[1947.34 --> 1947.86]  in the forum
[1947.86 --> 1949.76]  which is not a Squarespace site
[1949.76 --> 1950.36]  because they don't have
[1950.36 --> 1951.00]  a forum template
[1951.00 --> 1951.94]  but that's a whole other thing
[1951.94 --> 1953.10]  and the link wasn't broken
[1953.10 --> 1954.14]  you weren't signed in
[1954.14 --> 1954.74]  bam
[1954.74 --> 1955.52]  oh
[1955.52 --> 1956.58]  whoa
[1956.58 --> 1957.18]  whoa
[1957.18 --> 1959.42]  um
[1959.42 --> 1962.22]  so pretty much
[1962.22 --> 1963.18]  that's all there is to it
[1963.18 --> 1964.38]  Squarespace.com
[1964.38 --> 1965.56]  make an awesome website
[1965.56 --> 1966.30]  that runs great
[1966.30 --> 1966.90]  on your computer
[1966.90 --> 1967.42]  your phone
[1967.42 --> 1968.10]  whatever else
[1968.10 --> 1969.40]  and if you use offer code
[1969.40 --> 1970.24]  linus
[1970.24 --> 1971.34]  on your
[1971.34 --> 1972.36]  first purchase
[1972.36 --> 1973.04]  you will save
[1973.04 --> 1973.98]  10%
[1973.98 --> 1975.22]  and
[1975.22 --> 1976.64]  iFixit
[1976.64 --> 1977.86]  is not
[1977.86 --> 1979.30]  a new sponsor
[1979.30 --> 1980.48]  today
[1980.48 --> 1981.82]  but they do
[1981.82 --> 1982.66]  can you be my Vanna
[1982.66 --> 1983.32]  oh
[1983.32 --> 1984.74]  yes
[1984.74 --> 1986.16]  he lives for the moments
[1986.16 --> 1987.14]  when he can be my Vanna
[1987.14 --> 1987.98]  okay
[1987.98 --> 1988.36]  so
[1988.36 --> 1989.40]  use offer code
[1989.40 --> 1989.78]  WAN
[1989.78 --> 1990.24]  to save
[1990.24 --> 1990.94]  10 dollars
[1990.94 --> 1991.54]  off a purchase
[1991.54 --> 1993.14]  at iFixit.com
[1993.14 --> 1994.40]  they have all kinds
[1994.40 --> 1995.24]  of great guides
[1995.24 --> 1996.76]  for disassembling
[1996.76 --> 1997.60]  and reassembling
[1997.60 --> 1998.12]  and fixing
[1998.12 --> 1998.66]  phones
[1998.66 --> 1999.24]  and tablets
[1999.24 --> 1999.96]  and computers
[1999.96 --> 2000.66]  and laptops
[2000.66 --> 2001.84]  which are technically
[2001.84 --> 2002.36]  computers
[2002.36 --> 2003.48]  and also
[2003.48 --> 2004.34]  phones and tablets
[2004.34 --> 2005.04]  are technically
[2005.04 --> 2005.84]  computers too
[2005.84 --> 2006.98]  anything that computes
[2006.98 --> 2007.58]  is a computer
[2007.58 --> 2008.60]  you're my computer
[2008.60 --> 2009.58]  aww
[2009.58 --> 2010.38]  aww what a moment
[2010.38 --> 2012.04]  so this
[2012.04 --> 2013.28]  is their
[2013.28 --> 2014.76]  all new
[2014.76 --> 2016.50]  small business
[2016.50 --> 2017.20]  like
[2017.20 --> 2018.30]  tool box
[2018.30 --> 2018.96]  thing
[2018.96 --> 2020.50]  so it's got their
[2020.50 --> 2022.12]  screwdriver set
[2022.12 --> 2023.38]  which is kind of like
[2023.38 --> 2024.44]  if you've ever
[2024.44 --> 2025.02]  if you've got the
[2025.02 --> 2025.82]  ProTech toolkit
[2025.82 --> 2027.24]  which is also in here
[2027.24 --> 2027.90]  and i'll show you guys
[2027.90 --> 2028.42]  that later
[2028.42 --> 2029.56]  then you'll probably
[2029.56 --> 2030.14]  have noticed
[2030.14 --> 2031.36]  that you can
[2031.36 --> 2032.06]  stick a thing
[2032.06 --> 2032.70]  through the hole
[2032.70 --> 2033.58]  if you know what i mean
[2033.58 --> 2034.86]  and twist it that way
[2034.86 --> 2036.08]  but sometimes you can't
[2036.08 --> 2036.80]  get enough torque
[2036.80 --> 2038.38]  so these ones are all
[2038.38 --> 2039.62]  are all rubber coated
[2039.62 --> 2040.98]  so they're a little bit
[2040.98 --> 2041.84]  better if you know
[2041.84 --> 2042.52]  you need a little bit
[2042.52 --> 2043.70]  more torque action there
[2043.70 --> 2045.02]  let's go ahead and
[2045.02 --> 2047.20]  what else we got in here
[2047.20 --> 2048.08]  they told me to
[2048.08 --> 2049.16]  familiarize myself with
[2049.16 --> 2050.20]  this kit before we started
[2050.20 --> 2050.72]  i didn't
[2050.72 --> 2051.44]  so here we go
[2051.44 --> 2053.26]  we have an anti-static
[2053.26 --> 2053.84]  wrist strap
[2053.84 --> 2055.20]  as well
[2055.20 --> 2056.64]  as a safe
[2056.64 --> 2058.16]  anti-static mat
[2058.16 --> 2059.40]  check this out
[2059.40 --> 2060.22]  so your wrist strap
[2060.22 --> 2061.70]  actually clips right in there
[2061.70 --> 2062.58]  so you got a safe
[2062.58 --> 2063.54]  workstation
[2063.54 --> 2065.74]  no tech toolkit
[2065.74 --> 2066.56]  is complete without
[2066.56 --> 2067.28]  a multimeter
[2067.28 --> 2068.32]  so you want to
[2068.32 --> 2069.20]  i mean we've used
[2069.20 --> 2069.82]  this stuff
[2069.82 --> 2071.16]  we've used stuff like
[2071.16 --> 2072.64]  this for even the
[2072.64 --> 2074.02]  most mundane thing
[2074.02 --> 2074.80]  like you don't have
[2074.80 --> 2076.06]  to be an electrical
[2076.06 --> 2076.90]  engineer to need a
[2076.90 --> 2077.40]  multimeter
[2077.40 --> 2079.04]  like evga
[2079.04 --> 2080.74]  had a like a
[2080.74 --> 2081.96]  kingpin graphics card
[2081.96 --> 2082.60]  that we were over
[2082.60 --> 2083.24]  clocking and we were
[2083.24 --> 2084.82]  like are these voltage
[2084.82 --> 2086.14]  adjustments even working
[2086.14 --> 2087.14]  are we even running
[2087.14 --> 2088.36]  the right bios for this
[2088.36 --> 2089.18]  some dude bought it
[2089.18 --> 2090.02]  that graphics card
[2090.02 --> 2090.62]  someone bought it
[2090.62 --> 2090.84]  today
[2090.84 --> 2091.58]  we sold it today
[2091.58 --> 2091.96]  nice
[2091.96 --> 2092.96]  all right
[2092.96 --> 2093.96]  so we were able to
[2093.96 --> 2094.82]  use the multimeter
[2094.82 --> 2095.76]  to validate
[2095.76 --> 2096.84]  that we got the
[2096.84 --> 2097.78]  lntube ios on
[2097.78 --> 2098.50]  correctly and that
[2098.50 --> 2099.06]  the voltage was
[2099.06 --> 2099.74]  actually adjusting
[2099.74 --> 2100.44]  so that's cool
[2100.44 --> 2101.96]  what the devil is this
[2101.96 --> 2102.62]  it's called an eye
[2102.62 --> 2102.92]  opener
[2102.92 --> 2103.96]  i actually don't know
[2103.96 --> 2104.34]  i know you're
[2104.34 --> 2104.88]  supposed to heat it
[2104.88 --> 2105.04]  up
[2105.04 --> 2106.04]  i'm assuming it melts
[2106.04 --> 2106.50]  like glue
[2106.50 --> 2107.66]  yes so these are
[2107.66 --> 2108.54]  fantastic
[2108.54 --> 2109.88]  you heat it up
[2109.88 --> 2110.50]  and then if you've
[2110.50 --> 2111.44]  got like an adhesive
[2111.44 --> 2113.72]  behind a screen
[2113.72 --> 2114.14]  or whatever
[2114.14 --> 2115.62]  it gets hot enough
[2115.62 --> 2116.76]  to melt the adhesive
[2116.76 --> 2117.48]  and make it easier
[2117.48 --> 2118.02]  to remove
[2118.02 --> 2119.42]  but not so hot
[2119.42 --> 2120.26]  that like you're
[2120.26 --> 2121.02]  pointing a heat gun
[2121.02 --> 2121.52]  at your device
[2121.52 --> 2122.36]  and probably cooking
[2122.36 --> 2122.62]  it
[2122.62 --> 2124.46]  this the pro tech
[2124.46 --> 2124.98]  tool kit
[2124.98 --> 2125.96]  has every bit under
[2125.96 --> 2126.40]  the sun
[2126.40 --> 2127.08]  your tri wings
[2127.08 --> 2128.18]  your security torxes
[2128.18 --> 2131.44]  your triangle bits
[2131.44 --> 2132.28]  you can take apart
[2132.28 --> 2133.28]  pretty much anything
[2133.28 --> 2133.96]  with this puppy
[2133.96 --> 2136.74]  we've got the screen
[2136.74 --> 2137.52]  and lens cleaner
[2137.52 --> 2140.66]  that's hard to
[2140.66 --> 2141.40]  here take this
[2141.40 --> 2142.96]  ah yes i love this
[2142.96 --> 2143.18]  puppy
[2143.18 --> 2144.02]  it's dangerous to go
[2144.02 --> 2144.20]  alone
[2144.20 --> 2145.24]  the magnetic project
[2145.24 --> 2146.00]  mat we've already
[2146.00 --> 2146.84]  shown this before
[2146.84 --> 2147.90]  because this is the
[2147.90 --> 2148.58]  one that i used when
[2148.58 --> 2149.40]  i did the iMac
[2149.40 --> 2150.10]  disassembly
[2150.10 --> 2150.86]  because there were
[2150.86 --> 2152.32]  like freaking 16
[2152.32 --> 2153.34]  20 different types
[2153.34 --> 2154.10]  of screws in there
[2154.10 --> 2155.34]  so it comes with a pen
[2155.34 --> 2155.92]  with an eraser
[2155.92 --> 2157.16]  you write what all
[2157.16 --> 2157.78]  the stuff you have
[2157.78 --> 2158.34]  on you put the
[2158.34 --> 2158.98]  screws on and it's
[2158.98 --> 2159.38]  magnetic
[2159.38 --> 2160.90]  what else is in here
[2160.90 --> 2161.48]  they have everything
[2161.48 --> 2161.86]  in here
[2161.86 --> 2162.80]  suction cups
[2162.80 --> 2164.48]  for pulling screens
[2164.48 --> 2165.70]  off of heavy screens
[2165.70 --> 2166.38]  off of things
[2166.38 --> 2167.34]  without dropping them
[2167.34 --> 2168.56]  or like slicing
[2168.56 --> 2169.40]  yourself open
[2169.40 --> 2171.70]  repair manifesto
[2171.70 --> 2172.32]  oh that's cute
[2172.32 --> 2174.30]  okay well that's
[2174.30 --> 2175.30]  more of a swag item
[2175.30 --> 2176.46]  cleaning cloth
[2176.46 --> 2177.72]  other more rugged
[2177.72 --> 2178.86]  microfiber cleaning
[2178.86 --> 2179.32]  cloth
[2179.32 --> 2180.82]  like a textured one
[2180.82 --> 2181.58]  and a non-textured
[2181.58 --> 2181.86]  one
[2181.86 --> 2182.86]  a puff thing
[2182.86 --> 2183.84]  for sticking in your
[2183.84 --> 2184.98]  eye and drying it
[2184.98 --> 2185.62]  out whenever you
[2185.62 --> 2186.40]  need your eyes to
[2186.40 --> 2187.48]  be dry because you
[2187.48 --> 2188.20]  cry too much
[2188.20 --> 2188.90]  or for dusting
[2188.90 --> 2189.44]  things you know
[2189.44 --> 2189.82]  whatever
[2189.82 --> 2191.98]  cleaning brush
[2191.98 --> 2193.20]  as well as
[2193.20 --> 2193.70]  one of their
[2193.70 --> 2194.44]  handy dandy
[2194.44 --> 2195.26]  you know
[2195.26 --> 2196.96]  slice the adhesive
[2196.96 --> 2197.80]  that's between
[2197.80 --> 2198.40]  the thing that
[2198.40 --> 2199.20]  you can't get at
[2199.20 --> 2200.66]  more prying tools
[2200.66 --> 2201.48]  extras for the
[2201.48 --> 2201.94]  ones that come
[2201.94 --> 2202.42]  in the protect
[2202.42 --> 2203.00]  tool kit
[2203.00 --> 2204.48]  how many freaking
[2204.48 --> 2205.26]  things are in here
[2205.26 --> 2206.54]  a bunch of opening
[2206.54 --> 2207.28]  picks they're kind
[2207.28 --> 2208.14]  of like guitar picks
[2208.14 --> 2208.84]  but special for
[2208.84 --> 2209.52]  opening more
[2209.52 --> 2210.16]  pry tools
[2210.16 --> 2212.86]  more pry tools
[2212.86 --> 2216.28]  more pry tools
[2216.28 --> 2219.90]  ah they're plastic
[2219.90 --> 2220.48]  cards
[2220.48 --> 2221.88]  next time you
[2221.88 --> 2222.42]  don't want to
[2222.42 --> 2223.16]  ruin your debit
[2223.16 --> 2224.20]  card or your
[2224.20 --> 2224.94]  gym membership
[2224.94 --> 2225.98]  prying something
[2225.98 --> 2226.66]  open they have
[2226.66 --> 2227.62]  special prying cards
[2227.62 --> 2228.06]  for that
[2228.06 --> 2228.98]  are we done
[2228.98 --> 2230.28]  seriously
[2230.28 --> 2231.22]  okay so
[2231.22 --> 2232.12]  someone has to
[2232.12 --> 2232.60]  take this home
[2232.60 --> 2232.90]  today
[2232.90 --> 2234.42]  an iron-on
[2234.42 --> 2235.56]  hand with a
[2235.56 --> 2235.90]  wrench
[2235.90 --> 2237.38]  repair person
[2237.38 --> 2237.96]  badge
[2237.96 --> 2240.20]  first one to
[2240.20 --> 2240.94]  say luke's last
[2240.94 --> 2241.34]  name
[2241.34 --> 2242.72]  there you are
[2242.72 --> 2243.82]  get on up
[2243.82 --> 2245.36]  here you're a
[2245.36 --> 2246.22]  certified repairman
[2246.22 --> 2247.88]  now or woman
[2247.88 --> 2248.36]  you have long
[2248.36 --> 2248.76]  hair I couldn't
[2248.76 --> 2249.84]  tell no I'm just
[2249.84 --> 2250.08]  kidding
[2250.08 --> 2251.84]  it's a beard
[2251.84 --> 2253.46]  hey hey
[2253.46 --> 2254.36]  ladies can have
[2254.36 --> 2254.86]  a beard too
[2254.86 --> 2255.52]  and that's okay
[2255.52 --> 2256.46]  yep yep
[2256.46 --> 2257.34]  I don't know
[2257.34 --> 2257.70]  I was reading
[2257.70 --> 2258.26]  some article
[2258.26 --> 2259.22]  some actress was
[2259.22 --> 2260.14]  upset by Hollywood
[2260.14 --> 2260.96]  beauty standards
[2260.96 --> 2261.50]  you know I
[2261.50 --> 2262.34]  literally didn't
[2262.34 --> 2262.72]  know it was
[2262.72 --> 2263.18]  possible
[2263.18 --> 2263.94]  yeah
[2263.94 --> 2264.46]  and then I
[2264.46 --> 2265.94]  brought it up
[2265.94 --> 2266.64]  in some conversation
[2266.64 --> 2267.08]  like you know
[2267.08 --> 2267.66]  it's obviously not
[2267.66 --> 2268.10]  because there's a
[2268.10 --> 2268.70]  beard my mom was
[2268.70 --> 2269.42]  like I shave
[2269.42 --> 2270.24]  I was like oh
[2270.24 --> 2271.36]  there you go
[2271.36 --> 2272.72]  today you learned
[2272.72 --> 2273.12]  yeah
[2273.12 --> 2274.94]  next up
[2274.94 --> 2275.80]  actually yeah
[2275.80 --> 2276.50]  we started
[2276.50 --> 2277.10]  recommending Dollar
[2277.10 --> 2277.40]  Shave Club
[2277.40 --> 2278.28]  Dollar Shave Club
[2278.28 --> 2279.56]  it makes sense
[2279.56 --> 2280.64]  all right we got
[2280.64 --> 2281.74]  Google's Project
[2281.74 --> 2282.78]  Sunroof
[2282.78 --> 2283.46]  so do you want to
[2283.46 --> 2284.02]  cover this one
[2284.02 --> 2285.52]  I'm so excited by
[2285.52 --> 2286.42]  this this is so
[2286.42 --> 2287.34]  cool okay so what
[2287.34 --> 2288.06]  Google's planning to
[2288.06 --> 2288.88]  do they're doing it
[2288.88 --> 2289.56]  in three different
[2289.56 --> 2290.44]  cities right now I
[2290.44 --> 2291.06]  don't remember what
[2291.06 --> 2292.46]  one so gg but
[2292.46 --> 2292.96]  there's not that
[2292.96 --> 2293.14]  many
[2293.14 --> 2293.24]  not Vancouver
[2293.24 --> 2293.72]  unfortunately
[2293.72 --> 2294.66]  so we're not that
[2294.66 --> 2295.22]  excited yet
[2295.22 --> 2296.32]  yes they're only in
[2296.32 --> 2296.60]  the states
[2296.60 --> 2297.80]  the idea is that
[2297.80 --> 2298.54]  they're using data
[2298.54 --> 2299.48]  from Google Maps
[2299.48 --> 2300.18]  to figure out
[2300.18 --> 2302.12]  basically what the
[2302.12 --> 2303.10]  sun value is
[2303.12 --> 2303.80]  of your house
[2303.80 --> 2304.34]  I just came up
[2304.34 --> 2304.80]  with that word
[2304.80 --> 2305.44]  but basically
[2305.44 --> 2306.96]  how much of your
[2306.96 --> 2307.92]  roof will get sun
[2307.92 --> 2308.80]  for how long
[2308.80 --> 2310.08]  and how much power
[2310.08 --> 2311.04]  and money that will
[2311.04 --> 2311.96]  save you if you get
[2311.96 --> 2312.96]  solar panels installed
[2312.96 --> 2313.84]  so that you can
[2313.84 --> 2314.80]  figure out things like
[2314.80 --> 2315.88]  should you get solar
[2315.88 --> 2316.50]  panels installed
[2316.50 --> 2317.22]  it'll also help you
[2317.22 --> 2317.80]  figure out how much
[2317.80 --> 2318.58]  that will cost
[2318.58 --> 2321.56]  so it can survey
[2321.56 --> 2322.56]  companies in your
[2322.56 --> 2324.20]  area and it can
[2324.20 --> 2324.86]  actually recommend
[2324.86 --> 2325.54]  ones to you
[2325.54 --> 2326.22]  tell you how much
[2326.22 --> 2327.04]  it'll cost to install
[2327.04 --> 2328.30]  tell you how long
[2328.30 --> 2328.88]  it's going to be
[2328.88 --> 2329.70]  until you've paid off
[2329.70 --> 2330.36]  your investment
[2330.36 --> 2331.78]  tons of stuff
[2331.78 --> 2332.58]  so basically the
[2332.58 --> 2334.02]  idea is taking a
[2334.02 --> 2334.80]  lot of the confusion
[2334.80 --> 2335.56]  out of getting
[2335.56 --> 2336.46]  solar panels installed
[2336.46 --> 2337.12]  on your house
[2337.12 --> 2338.60]  and making it a lot
[2338.60 --> 2339.42]  easier in terms of
[2339.42 --> 2339.98]  barrier of entry
[2339.98 --> 2340.38]  for people
[2340.38 --> 2341.04]  making it make a lot
[2341.04 --> 2341.48]  more sense
[2341.48 --> 2342.16]  so it does all the
[2342.16 --> 2343.20]  hardcore math for you
[2343.20 --> 2343.94]  and it solves all
[2343.94 --> 2344.76]  the complicated problems
[2344.76 --> 2345.96]  which I think is great
[2345.96 --> 2346.68]  because solar panels
[2346.68 --> 2347.12]  are cool
[2347.12 --> 2349.60]  if we get the strata
[2349.60 --> 2350.32]  to accept it
[2350.32 --> 2351.04]  I really want to put
[2351.04 --> 2351.76]  solar panels on our
[2351.76 --> 2351.94]  roof
[2351.94 --> 2352.74]  so
[2352.74 --> 2353.78]  but we have to get
[2353.78 --> 2354.44]  the strata to accept it
[2354.44 --> 2355.42]  yeah strata's going to
[2355.42 --> 2356.62]  have to be down for it
[2356.62 --> 2357.98]  I'm really not sure
[2357.98 --> 2358.78]  how that works
[2358.78 --> 2359.82]  we're new to this
[2359.82 --> 2360.36]  strata's don't really
[2360.36 --> 2361.76]  and we just did this
[2361.76 --> 2363.32]  so I don't know how
[2363.32 --> 2363.90]  many good books
[2363.90 --> 2364.58]  we're in right now
[2364.58 --> 2366.00]  I have no idea
[2366.00 --> 2367.26]  how many emails
[2367.26 --> 2369.50]  we took kind of
[2369.50 --> 2370.18]  an ask forgiveness
[2370.18 --> 2370.88]  not permission
[2370.88 --> 2371.84]  approach to the
[2371.84 --> 2372.44]  meetup today
[2372.44 --> 2373.88]  so for those of you
[2373.88 --> 2375.14]  who weren't here live
[2375.14 --> 2375.68]  who are watching
[2375.68 --> 2377.34]  we had probably
[2377.34 --> 2378.52]  as many as probably
[2378.52 --> 2379.54]  about 300 people
[2379.54 --> 2380.22]  here at one point
[2380.22 --> 2381.88]  like it was
[2381.88 --> 2383.12]  bananas
[2383.12 --> 2383.62]  you guys think
[2383.62 --> 2384.34]  more than 300
[2384.34 --> 2385.82]  okay well
[2385.82 --> 2387.28]  we had
[2387.28 --> 2388.74]  a ton
[2388.74 --> 2389.48]  of people
[2389.48 --> 2389.80]  like
[2389.80 --> 2390.86]  we had a lineup
[2390.86 --> 2391.88]  for the garage sale
[2391.88 --> 2392.68]  down the block
[2392.68 --> 2393.70]  we had a lineup
[2393.70 --> 2395.08]  for tours of the office
[2395.08 --> 2395.86]  which we are going to
[2395.86 --> 2396.58]  continue to do
[2396.58 --> 2397.66]  after the show today
[2397.66 --> 2399.24]  that was down to the
[2399.24 --> 2400.52]  lineup for the garage sale
[2400.52 --> 2400.94]  yeah
[2400.94 --> 2403.18]  so we have no idea
[2403.18 --> 2404.22]  how stoked they are on us
[2404.22 --> 2404.74]  fortunately
[2404.74 --> 2405.92]  we've already got
[2405.92 --> 2406.70]  the strata's approval
[2406.70 --> 2407.56]  for my big linus
[2407.56 --> 2408.36]  media group sign
[2408.36 --> 2408.84]  that's going to be
[2408.84 --> 2409.38]  going on the front
[2409.38 --> 2409.80]  of the building
[2409.80 --> 2410.84]  I picked up the
[2410.84 --> 2411.64]  permit for that
[2411.64 --> 2412.36]  on
[2412.36 --> 2413.86]  you get a permit
[2413.86 --> 2414.28]  for that
[2414.28 --> 2415.12]  yeah yesterday
[2415.12 --> 2415.74]  I hate strata
[2415.74 --> 2416.34]  I picked up the
[2416.34 --> 2416.72]  no we had
[2416.72 --> 2417.12]  we had to have
[2417.12 --> 2417.96]  a city permit too
[2417.96 --> 2418.64]  oh my goodness
[2418.64 --> 2419.18]  yeah we had to get
[2419.18 --> 2419.98]  approval from the strata
[2419.98 --> 2421.00]  then we had to get a permit
[2421.00 --> 2421.92]  that could make sense
[2421.92 --> 2422.40]  because it could fall
[2422.40 --> 2422.80]  off the building
[2422.80 --> 2423.16]  yeah
[2423.16 --> 2423.78]  but like stratas
[2423.78 --> 2424.70]  are so frustrating
[2424.70 --> 2425.32]  but like
[2425.32 --> 2426.42]  I mean fortunately
[2426.42 --> 2427.38]  like they wouldn't let us
[2427.38 --> 2428.28]  cover the windows
[2428.28 --> 2429.44]  we need to cover the windows
[2429.44 --> 2430.10]  for like lighting
[2430.10 --> 2430.20]  for filming
[2430.20 --> 2431.30]  they said that we have
[2431.30 --> 2432.02]  to get approval
[2432.02 --> 2433.38]  they didn't say no
[2433.38 --> 2434.92]  they just said that
[2434.92 --> 2435.76]  we have to bring it up
[2435.76 --> 2436.30]  at a meeting
[2436.30 --> 2437.70]  okay
[2437.70 --> 2438.70]  the fact that you have
[2438.70 --> 2439.18]  to bring it up
[2439.18 --> 2439.56]  on a meeting
[2439.56 --> 2440.20]  to put covers
[2440.20 --> 2441.76]  inside your own building
[2441.76 --> 2442.24]  is nuts
[2442.24 --> 2442.96]  the good news
[2442.96 --> 2444.22]  is that we're occupying
[2444.22 --> 2445.38]  three of the eight units
[2445.38 --> 2446.12]  in this building
[2446.12 --> 2447.06]  which gives us
[2447.06 --> 2448.36]  an awful lot of votes
[2448.36 --> 2451.28]  that's helpful
[2451.28 --> 2451.58]  yeah
[2451.58 --> 2452.70]  that's pretty good
[2452.70 --> 2453.98]  we just gotta make sure
[2453.98 --> 2454.72]  we don't piss off
[2454.72 --> 2456.06]  literally everyone
[2456.06 --> 2456.94]  which we might have
[2456.94 --> 2457.46]  just done
[2457.46 --> 2457.90]  so
[2457.90 --> 2459.12]  so
[2459.12 --> 2460.10]  let's go ahead
[2460.10 --> 2460.52]  and
[2460.52 --> 2462.30]  awesome
[2462.30 --> 2463.50]  thank you so much
[2463.50 --> 2464.30]  I have been talking
[2464.30 --> 2466.34]  so much today
[2466.34 --> 2467.22]  and those
[2467.22 --> 2467.52]  you
[2467.52 --> 2469.38]  that's awesome
[2469.38 --> 2470.84]  I know this man
[2470.84 --> 2471.30]  sorry
[2471.30 --> 2472.16]  keep going
[2472.16 --> 2476.24]  so it's finally happened
[2476.24 --> 2478.78]  an actual fashion watch
[2478.78 --> 2479.32]  brand
[2479.32 --> 2480.94]  has gotten around
[2480.94 --> 2482.86]  to doing a smart watch
[2482.86 --> 2483.82]  fossil unveils
[2483.82 --> 2484.72]  it's intel powered
[2484.72 --> 2485.90]  android wear watch
[2485.90 --> 2487.64]  flat tire display
[2487.64 --> 2488.76]  in tow
[2488.76 --> 2489.58]  so let's
[2489.58 --> 2491.00]  so these are just some
[2491.00 --> 2492.12]  these are just some
[2492.12 --> 2493.26]  not not actually
[2493.26 --> 2493.92]  android wear
[2493.92 --> 2494.56]  these are typical
[2494.56 --> 2495.46]  fossil watches
[2495.46 --> 2496.42]  alright
[2496.42 --> 2497.26]  bippity boppity
[2497.26 --> 2499.06]  there it is
[2499.06 --> 2499.82]  so
[2499.82 --> 2501.68]  um
[2501.68 --> 2502.22]  yeah
[2502.22 --> 2503.56]  it kinda looks like
[2503.56 --> 2504.60]  a moto 360
[2504.60 --> 2507.32]  it super looks like
[2507.32 --> 2508.02]  a moto 360
[2508.02 --> 2508.52]  yeah
[2508.52 --> 2509.74]  well I said kind of
[2509.74 --> 2511.20]  because I'm a generous person
[2511.20 --> 2512.10]  I'm not
[2512.10 --> 2512.78]  yeah
[2512.78 --> 2513.50]  it's a moto 360
[2513.50 --> 2514.28]  so basically
[2514.28 --> 2515.54]  it's kinda shinier
[2515.54 --> 2517.18]  also it has like
[2517.18 --> 2518.50]  beveling and crap
[2518.50 --> 2519.24]  and hopefully the battery
[2519.24 --> 2519.72]  lasts longer
[2519.72 --> 2521.40]  I mean the thing about a watch
[2521.40 --> 2522.20]  it's android wear
[2522.20 --> 2523.44]  is that there's really
[2523.44 --> 2525.40]  not a whole lot
[2525.40 --> 2526.40]  you can do with it
[2526.40 --> 2527.24]  with android wear
[2527.24 --> 2529.32]  yeah you can go square
[2529.32 --> 2530.60]  or you can go
[2530.60 --> 2531.74]  round
[2531.74 --> 2533.28]  because like saying watch
[2533.28 --> 2534.04]  in general is not really
[2534.04 --> 2534.20]  fair
[2534.20 --> 2534.86]  or you can have a
[2534.86 --> 2535.24]  there's a lot you can do
[2535.24 --> 2535.80]  with a mechanical watch
[2535.80 --> 2536.94]  you can have a rubber strap
[2536.94 --> 2539.06]  or like a leather one
[2539.06 --> 2541.20]  or like maybe it could come with
[2541.20 --> 2543.04]  two straps
[2543.04 --> 2543.54]  whoa
[2543.54 --> 2545.18]  and you could change them out
[2545.18 --> 2545.52]  whoa
[2545.52 --> 2547.24]  so I mean I get it
[2547.24 --> 2549.14]  it's not really that different
[2549.14 --> 2549.90]  um
[2549.90 --> 2551.50]  so they also showed off
[2551.50 --> 2552.50]  some other stuff
[2552.50 --> 2553.38]  a fitness band
[2553.38 --> 2554.60]  a semi smart watch
[2554.60 --> 2555.46]  and then the fully fledged
[2555.46 --> 2555.98]  smart watch
[2555.98 --> 2556.84]  um
[2556.84 --> 2558.84]  I think the technology
[2558.84 --> 2560.02]  has to
[2560.02 --> 2561.98]  has to continue
[2561.98 --> 2563.22]  to progress a little bit
[2563.22 --> 2563.92]  I mean Samsung
[2563.92 --> 2564.64]  and LG
[2564.64 --> 2565.48]  are both
[2565.48 --> 2566.74]  showing off
[2566.74 --> 2568.30]  transparent OLED displays
[2568.30 --> 2569.80]  that are capable of
[2569.80 --> 2570.70]  in the neighborhood
[2570.70 --> 2571.06]  of
[2571.06 --> 2572.20]  50%
[2572.20 --> 2573.64]  plus or minus
[2573.64 --> 2574.42]  transparency
[2574.42 --> 2575.52]  I mean
[2575.52 --> 2576.42]  I think
[2576.42 --> 2577.52]  that's when you're gonna
[2577.52 --> 2578.04]  capture
[2578.04 --> 2579.40]  a lot of people
[2579.40 --> 2580.26]  when you can put
[2580.26 --> 2581.22]  a really thin
[2581.22 --> 2582.52]  transparent display
[2582.52 --> 2583.92]  over top of what is
[2583.92 --> 2584.50]  otherwise
[2584.50 --> 2586.30]  a beautifully crafted
[2586.30 --> 2587.50]  mechanical watch
[2587.50 --> 2588.84]  that's
[2588.84 --> 2589.56]  when you're gonna
[2589.56 --> 2590.66]  get a lot of attention
[2590.66 --> 2591.36]  and I know
[2591.36 --> 2592.76]  there's that one company
[2592.76 --> 2593.62]  that's done it
[2593.62 --> 2594.56]  that everyone always
[2594.56 --> 2595.36]  links us when we say
[2595.36 --> 2596.16]  this every time
[2596.16 --> 2596.96]  and they're like
[2596.96 --> 2597.78]  not good
[2597.78 --> 2599.82]  just
[2599.82 --> 2600.82]  they're just not
[2600.82 --> 2601.48]  you're not feeling
[2601.48 --> 2602.16]  charitable today
[2602.16 --> 2602.40]  no
[2602.40 --> 2603.42]  but it's true
[2603.42 --> 2604.16]  I don't know
[2604.16 --> 2604.74]  like I'm feeling
[2604.74 --> 2605.52]  charitable because
[2605.52 --> 2607.38]  Google's sunroof thing
[2607.38 --> 2608.06]  is fantastic
[2608.06 --> 2608.86]  I'm not feeling
[2608.86 --> 2609.40]  charitable because
[2609.40 --> 2610.56]  that watch is trash
[2610.56 --> 2611.44]  ouch
[2611.44 --> 2612.64]  it is though
[2612.64 --> 2613.38]  look it up
[2613.38 --> 2614.32]  everyone that buys one
[2614.32 --> 2614.78]  is like yeah
[2614.78 --> 2615.62]  this thing is terrible
[2615.62 --> 2616.54]  I wish I didn't
[2616.54 --> 2617.10]  waste my money
[2617.10 --> 2618.02]  so I don't want to
[2618.02 --> 2618.72]  help other people
[2618.72 --> 2619.68]  waste their money
[2619.68 --> 2620.04]  fair enough
[2620.04 --> 2620.46]  it doesn't seem
[2620.46 --> 2620.90]  like a good idea
[2620.90 --> 2621.08]  it's not really
[2621.08 --> 2621.56]  what we do
[2621.56 --> 2621.88]  no
[2621.88 --> 2623.66]  so there you go
[2623.66 --> 2625.74]  there's no word
[2625.74 --> 2626.94]  on the hardware
[2626.94 --> 2628.44]  inside the Android
[2628.44 --> 2629.54]  smartwatch from
[2629.54 --> 2630.08]  Fossil
[2630.08 --> 2631.14]  the battery life
[2631.14 --> 2631.76]  pricing or the
[2631.76 --> 2632.48]  release time frame
[2632.48 --> 2633.74]  one thing that I
[2633.74 --> 2634.92]  will say is
[2634.92 --> 2636.12]  if they don't have
[2636.12 --> 2637.30]  an always on display
[2637.30 --> 2638.58]  it's getting a
[2638.58 --> 2639.50]  negative review from
[2639.50 --> 2640.34]  me if it gets one
[2640.34 --> 2640.72]  at all
[2640.72 --> 2641.60]  it might just get a
[2641.60 --> 2642.24]  mention on WAN
[2642.24 --> 2642.56]  show
[2642.56 --> 2644.06]  hey they screwed up
[2644.06 --> 2644.70]  yet another one
[2644.70 --> 2645.28]  what if it's one of
[2645.28 --> 2646.24]  the transparent ones
[2646.24 --> 2647.10]  and the screen is
[2647.10 --> 2648.64]  off unless you do
[2648.64 --> 2649.54]  I'm okay with that
[2649.54 --> 2650.82]  I'm totally okay
[2650.82 --> 2651.32]  with that
[2651.32 --> 2653.12]  I mean for me
[2653.12 --> 2654.06]  the big thing is
[2654.06 --> 2654.68]  just
[2654.68 --> 2656.32]  I want to be able
[2656.32 --> 2656.78]  to see
[2656.78 --> 2657.48]  and I know I made
[2657.48 --> 2658.54]  that awful joke
[2658.54 --> 2659.46]  in my Apple watch
[2659.46 --> 2660.08]  review which
[2660.08 --> 2661.60]  ended up even more
[2661.60 --> 2662.50]  awkward because of
[2662.50 --> 2663.18]  Ed's editing
[2663.18 --> 2663.82]  on that
[2663.82 --> 2664.60]  that was just
[2664.60 --> 2665.48]  that was pretty
[2665.48 --> 2666.30]  cringe right there
[2666.30 --> 2667.64]  but it is a
[2667.64 --> 2668.56]  perfectly valid point
[2668.56 --> 2669.84]  the time when I
[2669.84 --> 2671.16]  realized that
[2671.16 --> 2672.14]  motion gestures
[2672.14 --> 2673.16]  were ridiculous
[2673.16 --> 2674.64]  was when I was
[2674.64 --> 2675.64]  laying on my back
[2675.64 --> 2677.24]  and my son was
[2677.24 --> 2678.06]  playing a game with
[2678.06 --> 2678.66]  me like he was
[2678.66 --> 2679.70]  going for a daddy
[2679.70 --> 2680.84]  ride and I was
[2680.84 --> 2681.38]  like oh I wonder
[2681.38 --> 2682.08]  what time it is
[2682.08 --> 2683.62]  and I was using
[2683.62 --> 2684.68]  the Apple watch
[2684.68 --> 2686.00]  and I couldn't
[2686.00 --> 2687.06]  look up the time
[2687.06 --> 2688.80]  because you have
[2688.80 --> 2689.48]  to be upright
[2689.48 --> 2690.20]  and do it like
[2690.20 --> 2690.68]  this
[2690.68 --> 2691.96]  like this
[2691.96 --> 2693.38]  repeat after me
[2693.38 --> 2694.08]  like this
[2694.08 --> 2694.86]  to see the time
[2694.86 --> 2695.92]  no it's ridiculous
[2695.92 --> 2697.98]  it's just ludicrous
[2697.98 --> 2698.78]  that motion reminded me
[2698.78 --> 2699.72]  of that super old
[2699.72 --> 2700.90]  school Apple
[2700.90 --> 2702.22]  like 1984 commercial
[2702.22 --> 2703.94]  when they're walking
[2703.94 --> 2704.38]  through and they're
[2704.38 --> 2704.96]  all watching the
[2704.96 --> 2705.56]  screen and stuff
[2705.56 --> 2706.64]  they're becoming
[2706.64 --> 2707.40]  what they hated
[2707.40 --> 2710.26]  so that's what
[2710.26 --> 2711.04]  I need to see
[2711.04 --> 2712.56]  and that's pretty
[2712.56 --> 2713.22]  much all there is
[2713.22 --> 2713.46]  to it
[2713.46 --> 2714.82]  now I'd like to
[2714.82 --> 2715.48]  do something
[2715.48 --> 2716.44]  a little bit
[2716.44 --> 2717.10]  special
[2717.10 --> 2717.96]  and I'm actually
[2717.96 --> 2718.68]  going to kick Luke
[2718.68 --> 2719.20]  off the show
[2719.20 --> 2719.96]  for a bit here
[2719.96 --> 2722.20]  normally we do
[2722.20 --> 2722.80]  well not quite
[2722.80 --> 2723.30]  no no don't go
[2723.30 --> 2723.52]  anywhere
[2723.52 --> 2724.08]  okay
[2724.08 --> 2725.48]  well no don't
[2725.48 --> 2726.02]  sit down either
[2726.02 --> 2726.88]  okay
[2726.88 --> 2728.74]  so normally
[2728.74 --> 2729.72]  when we want to
[2729.72 --> 2730.70]  get like questions
[2730.70 --> 2731.36]  or comments
[2731.36 --> 2732.08]  from the audience
[2732.08 --> 2733.28]  we take to Twitter
[2733.28 --> 2734.86]  but the audience
[2734.86 --> 2735.48]  is here
[2735.48 --> 2736.80]  so I would like
[2736.80 --> 2737.72]  for Luke to be
[2737.72 --> 2738.76]  my doorman here
[2738.76 --> 2739.36]  and if anyone
[2739.36 --> 2740.16]  would like to come
[2740.16 --> 2740.82]  and do a live
[2740.82 --> 2741.58]  Twitter blitz

[2746.44 --> 2747.06]  kind of polite
[2747.06 --> 2747.48]  person

[2842.04 --> 2842.66]  subordinate
[2842.66 --> 2843.62]  or your new
[2843.62 --> 2844.06]  peer
[2844.06 --> 2844.90]  or your new
[2844.90 --> 2845.64]  boss
[2845.64 --> 2847.36]  might be selected
[2847.36 --> 2848.72]  by someone
[2848.72 --> 2849.16]  else
[2849.16 --> 2850.06]  and
[2850.06 --> 2850.98]  you know
[2850.98 --> 2851.80]  I'm not saying
[2851.80 --> 2852.40]  that my years
[2852.40 --> 2853.00]  at NCIX
[2853.00 --> 2853.80]  were bad
[2853.80 --> 2854.72]  in any way
[2854.72 --> 2855.44]  I learned
[2855.44 --> 2856.48]  so much
[2856.48 --> 2857.22]  and I'm
[2857.22 --> 2858.30]  incredibly grateful
[2858.30 --> 2859.22]  to everyone
[2859.22 --> 2860.06]  from the president
[2860.06 --> 2860.66]  of the company
[2860.66 --> 2861.16]  up there
[2861.16 --> 2861.40]  who
[2861.40 --> 2862.26]  by the end
[2862.26 --> 2863.06]  of my time
[2863.06 --> 2864.20]  at NCIX
[2864.20 --> 2865.20]  I reported to
[2865.20 --> 2865.66]  directly
[2865.66 --> 2866.54]  I'm grateful
[2866.54 --> 2867.04]  to everyone
[2867.04 --> 2867.66]  from him
[2867.66 --> 2868.62]  down to
[2868.62 --> 2869.20]  you know
[2869.20 --> 2869.60]  the guys
[2869.60 --> 2870.26]  in the warehouse
[2870.26 --> 2871.56]  that made sure
[2871.56 --> 2872.40]  that my orders
[2872.40 --> 2873.90]  got counted correctly
[2873.90 --> 2874.78]  and labeled correctly
[2874.78 --> 2875.26]  and shipped
[2875.26 --> 2876.06]  to other customers
[2876.06 --> 2876.62]  on time
[2876.62 --> 2876.88]  like
[2876.88 --> 2878.00]  it was such
[2878.00 --> 2878.40]  an amazing
[2878.40 --> 2879.22]  learning experience
[2879.22 --> 2880.10]  but
[2880.10 --> 2881.08]  Linus Media Group
[2881.08 --> 2881.74]  the greatest thing
[2881.74 --> 2882.20]  about it
[2882.20 --> 2882.92]  is the people
[2882.92 --> 2883.22]  here
[2883.22 --> 2884.90]  every one
[2884.90 --> 2885.36]  of them
[2885.36 --> 2886.56]  is handpicked
[2886.56 --> 2887.42]  by me
[2887.42 --> 2888.40]  so
[2888.40 --> 2889.36]  I
[2889.36 --> 2890.18]  have no one
[2890.18 --> 2890.56]  to blame
[2890.56 --> 2891.32]  but myself
[2891.32 --> 2892.36]  if
[2892.36 --> 2893.44]  it doesn't work out
[2893.44 --> 2894.48]  and we have
[2894.48 --> 2895.30]  an incredible team
[2895.30 --> 2895.58]  here
[2895.58 --> 2897.04]  absolutely world class
[2897.04 --> 2897.62]  I mean
[2897.62 --> 2898.66]  I think the results
[2898.66 --> 2899.66]  speak for themselves
[2899.66 --> 2901.20]  since Linus Tech Tips
[2901.20 --> 2902.10]  has gone indie
[2902.10 --> 2903.42]  and is under
[2903.42 --> 2903.84]  the banner
[2903.84 --> 2904.80]  of Linus Media Group
[2904.80 --> 2905.50]  our growth
[2905.50 --> 2906.16]  has gone
[2906.16 --> 2907.24]  like this
[2907.24 --> 2908.22]  so
[2908.22 --> 2908.82]  yeah
[2908.82 --> 2909.96]  that's what I love
[2909.96 --> 2910.84]  about Linus Media Group
[2910.84 --> 2912.22]  I think the worst thing
[2912.22 --> 2912.66]  about it
[2912.66 --> 2913.08]  is the
[2913.08 --> 2914.14]  can I help you
[2914.14 --> 2915.66]  they're great
[2915.66 --> 2916.06]  other than
[2916.06 --> 2917.16]  throwing things at me
[2917.16 --> 2918.16]  I mean
[2918.16 --> 2918.80]  that's another great
[2918.80 --> 2919.28]  thing about it
[2919.28 --> 2919.70]  we have a really
[2919.70 --> 2920.54]  great work dynamic
[2920.54 --> 2921.44]  you know
[2921.44 --> 2921.84]  people
[2921.84 --> 2923.02]  I see a lot
[2923.02 --> 2923.60]  I see a lot of
[2923.60 --> 2923.96]  comments
[2923.96 --> 2924.54]  like Linus
[2924.54 --> 2925.52]  is the worst boss ever
[2925.52 --> 2926.44]  he's such a jerk
[2926.44 --> 2927.26]  he's such a troll
[2927.26 --> 2929.08]  you guys gotta understand
[2929.08 --> 2931.24]  I get that back
[2931.24 --> 2932.26]  from these guys
[2932.26 --> 2934.02]  this is the kind of company
[2934.02 --> 2934.94]  where you can
[2934.94 --> 2935.78]  legitimately
[2935.78 --> 2936.98]  shoot your boss
[2936.98 --> 2937.70]  with a nerf gun
[2937.70 --> 2938.26]  in the head
[2938.26 --> 2939.12]  and
[2939.12 --> 2940.02]  it's cool
[2940.02 --> 2943.72]  don't go get a gun
[2943.72 --> 2944.34]  right now
[2944.34 --> 2949.38]  the worst thing about it
[2949.38 --> 2950.10]  I think is probably
[2950.10 --> 2950.66]  the hours
[2950.66 --> 2951.76]  I thought that
[2951.76 --> 2952.92]  compared to my job
[2952.92 --> 2954.02]  as a product manager
[2954.02 --> 2955.12]  it couldn't get any worse
[2955.12 --> 2956.40]  but
[2956.40 --> 2957.52]  it is worse
[2957.52 --> 2958.24]  I mean
[2958.24 --> 2959.62]  a lot of people think
[2959.62 --> 2960.34]  YouTube's easy
[2960.34 --> 2960.96]  and you just
[2960.96 --> 2962.08]  like stand in front
[2962.08 --> 2962.48]  of a camera
[2962.48 --> 2963.10]  for 10 minutes
[2963.10 --> 2963.76]  and then you just
[2963.76 --> 2964.18]  throw it up
[2964.18 --> 2964.64]  on the internet
[2964.64 --> 2965.04]  send
[2965.04 --> 2966.06]  it used to be easy
[2966.06 --> 2967.30]  out of necessity
[2967.30 --> 2968.30]  that's why I did
[2968.30 --> 2968.92]  unboxings
[2968.92 --> 2969.74]  because they were easy
[2969.74 --> 2971.64]  and I could just
[2971.64 --> 2972.92]  I could do an unboxing
[2972.92 --> 2973.78]  in one take
[2973.78 --> 2974.90]  no problem
[2974.90 --> 2976.04]  a lot of the time
[2976.04 --> 2976.52]  not always
[2976.52 --> 2978.12]  sometimes I broke things
[2978.12 --> 2978.46]  or whatever
[2978.46 --> 2978.74]  but
[2978.74 --> 2980.16]  but the point is
[2980.16 --> 2980.78]  is that
[2980.78 --> 2983.72]  because we've tried
[2983.72 --> 2984.50]  to really
[2984.50 --> 2985.74]  amp up
[2985.74 --> 2986.50]  what we're doing
[2986.50 --> 2987.96]  in every possible way
[2987.96 --> 2989.78]  every additional body
[2989.78 --> 2990.76]  that we add here
[2990.76 --> 2992.06]  is all about
[2992.06 --> 2993.70]  increasing quality
[2993.70 --> 2994.84]  making what we're doing
[2994.84 --> 2996.02]  more and better
[2996.02 --> 2996.92]  so
[2996.92 --> 2998.08]  the hardest part
[2998.08 --> 2999.30]  is how much work it is
[2999.30 --> 3000.44]  alright
[3000.44 --> 3001.24]  what's your name
[3001.24 --> 3002.08]  my name is Daniel
[3002.08 --> 3003.18]  two years ago
[3003.18 --> 3003.88]  you guys were
[3003.88 --> 3005.10]  working out of a house
[3005.10 --> 3006.46]  Linus Media Group
[3006.46 --> 3007.12]  just got started
[3007.12 --> 3008.68]  and now you're here
[3008.68 --> 3009.64]  what do you see
[3009.64 --> 3010.46]  year two
[3010.46 --> 3011.02]  maybe three
[3011.02 --> 3011.40]  in the future
[3011.40 --> 3012.20]  wow
[3012.20 --> 3013.30]  it's a great question
[3013.30 --> 3014.02]  and go away
[3014.02 --> 3017.62]  that's a great question
[3017.62 --> 3018.64]  and it's one that
[3018.64 --> 3019.18]  unfortunately
[3019.18 --> 3020.92]  I don't have a crystal ball
[3020.92 --> 3021.54]  that is
[3021.54 --> 3023.00]  amazing enough to answer
[3023.00 --> 3023.50]  because
[3023.50 --> 3025.22]  if you had asked me
[3025.22 --> 3026.48]  two and a half years ago
[3026.48 --> 3027.78]  when we started this
[3027.78 --> 3029.22]  when we were working out
[3029.22 --> 3029.88]  of the garage
[3029.88 --> 3030.68]  at my house
[3030.68 --> 3032.38]  if you'd asked me
[3032.38 --> 3034.00]  where I saw Linus Media Group
[3034.00 --> 3035.56]  two and a half years from now
[3035.56 --> 3037.26]  well actually no
[3037.26 --> 3038.50]  I didn't even think about that
[3038.50 --> 3039.78]  I thought about five years
[3039.78 --> 3041.86]  and five years
[3041.86 --> 3043.26]  when it was just three of us
[3043.26 --> 3044.20]  it was me, Luke and Ed
[3044.20 --> 3045.46]  and if you asked me
[3045.46 --> 3045.98]  five years
[3045.98 --> 3046.54]  I would have said
[3046.54 --> 3047.50]  well I mean five
[3047.50 --> 3048.58]  maybe six people
[3048.58 --> 3049.86]  and like
[3049.86 --> 3050.98]  you know
[3050.98 --> 3051.64]  we'll do
[3051.64 --> 3053.24]  better unboxings
[3053.24 --> 3053.98]  and we'll have like
[3053.98 --> 3054.76]  more channels
[3054.76 --> 3055.76]  we'll kind of do
[3055.76 --> 3056.78]  unboxings of tech
[3056.78 --> 3057.48]  and then maybe we'll do
[3057.48 --> 3058.46]  like unboxings of
[3058.46 --> 3059.60]  like tools or cars
[3059.60 --> 3060.22]  or other things
[3060.22 --> 3060.46]  like
[3060.46 --> 3061.40]  we'll have like
[3061.40 --> 3062.34]  the unboxing network
[3062.34 --> 3064.12]  that would have been
[3064.12 --> 3064.80]  my vision
[3064.80 --> 3066.28]  here we are
[3066.28 --> 3067.40]  two and a half years in
[3067.40 --> 3068.28]  we have
[3068.28 --> 3069.44]  either ten or eleven
[3069.44 --> 3069.86]  people
[3069.86 --> 3072.46]  we're in an actual studio
[3072.46 --> 3074.88]  we don't do unboxings
[3074.88 --> 3075.52]  anymore really
[3075.52 --> 3077.84]  and our new channels
[3077.84 --> 3078.48]  are things like
[3078.48 --> 3079.38]  channel super fun
[3079.38 --> 3080.30]  where we're
[3080.30 --> 3081.14]  pitting dildos
[3081.14 --> 3082.12]  against each other
[3082.12 --> 3084.74]  one against one
[3084.74 --> 3086.04]  it's a race to the finish line
[3086.04 --> 3086.24]  like
[3086.24 --> 3088.36]  who can predict that stuff
[3088.36 --> 3089.20]  can I change my title
[3089.20 --> 3090.02]  to dildo engineer?
[3090.22 --> 3090.50]  no
[3090.50 --> 3092.40]  too late
[3092.40 --> 3093.60]  truth is stranger
[3093.60 --> 3094.50]  than fiction sometimes
[3094.50 --> 3095.34]  and if you'd asked me
[3095.34 --> 3096.18]  when we moved into
[3096.18 --> 3097.44]  the house studio
[3097.44 --> 3098.82]  I'd have told you
[3098.82 --> 3099.44]  that was easily
[3099.44 --> 3100.14]  going to last us
[3100.14 --> 3100.74]  five years
[3100.74 --> 3102.02]  we made it for two
[3102.02 --> 3103.64]  and that place was
[3103.64 --> 3104.70]  bursting at the seams
[3104.70 --> 3106.00]  what's your name?
[3106.42 --> 3106.68]  Andrew
[3106.68 --> 3107.20]  alright
[3107.20 --> 3108.44]  Andrew what's your question?
[3108.80 --> 3109.68]  how would you compare
[3109.68 --> 3111.50]  the work style
[3111.50 --> 3112.90]  at the old house office
[3112.90 --> 3113.96]  compared to your new office?
[3114.62 --> 3114.92]  so
[3114.92 --> 3116.28]  thank you
[3116.28 --> 3116.84]  go away
[3116.84 --> 3117.40]  and
[3117.40 --> 3119.98]  I don't mean go away
[3119.98 --> 3120.76]  you can stay close enough
[3120.76 --> 3121.36]  to hear the answer
[3121.36 --> 3122.62]  no Andrew come back
[3122.62 --> 3124.14]  no no I mean
[3124.14 --> 3125.08]  no don't sit down
[3125.08 --> 3126.90]  right there's fine
[3126.90 --> 3128.72]  what?
[3132.72 --> 3133.20]  so
[3133.20 --> 3134.14]  the workflow
[3134.14 --> 3136.18]  is not yet established here
[3136.18 --> 3136.68]  we're
[3136.68 --> 3137.64]  I'm gonna have a video
[3137.64 --> 3138.52]  coming really soon
[3138.52 --> 3139.68]  about the way
[3139.68 --> 3140.58]  that we're gonna handle
[3140.58 --> 3141.38]  footage
[3141.38 --> 3143.22]  and transcoding it
[3143.22 --> 3143.96]  and people who went
[3143.96 --> 3145.30]  on the tour with me
[3145.30 --> 3146.00]  might know a little bit
[3146.00 --> 3146.70]  about this
[3146.70 --> 3148.24]  the workflow
[3148.24 --> 3149.54]  in terms of
[3149.54 --> 3150.06]  shooting
[3150.06 --> 3151.54]  is gonna be
[3151.54 --> 3153.32]  way tidier
[3153.32 --> 3155.40]  much much tidier
[3155.40 --> 3157.14]  I don't understand
[3157.14 --> 3157.62]  you're supposed to
[3157.62 --> 3157.96]  throw it
[3157.96 --> 3158.74]  or give it to someone
[3158.74 --> 3159.08]  oh
[3159.08 --> 3160.22]  free shirt
[3160.22 --> 3161.80]  woo
[3161.80 --> 3165.06]  I'm looking over here
[3165.06 --> 3166.02]  it's going over there
[3166.02 --> 3167.46]  oh am I doing
[3167.46 --> 3168.78]  more swag shirts
[3168.78 --> 3169.32]  bah
[3169.32 --> 3171.04]  um
[3171.04 --> 3172.92]  so
[3172.92 --> 3173.62]  the main thing
[3173.62 --> 3174.22]  I expect
[3174.22 --> 3175.08]  in the new workflow
[3175.08 --> 3176.00]  is organization
[3176.00 --> 3177.16]  because in the past
[3177.16 --> 3178.84]  we had one place
[3178.84 --> 3179.80]  where like
[3179.80 --> 3181.12]  sometimes I was actually
[3181.12 --> 3182.04]  testing hardware
[3182.04 --> 3183.38]  and then I was
[3183.38 --> 3184.40]  filming like
[3184.40 --> 3185.50]  the main video
[3185.50 --> 3186.98]  and then I'd have to
[3186.98 --> 3188.14]  get my crap out of there
[3188.14 --> 3188.86]  and Brandon had to
[3188.86 --> 3189.64]  move his cameras in
[3189.64 --> 3190.16]  and shoot b-roll
[3190.16 --> 3191.10]  there was just no room
[3191.10 --> 3191.60]  for anything
[3191.60 --> 3193.18]  so we're gonna actually
[3193.18 --> 3194.18]  have things go
[3194.18 --> 3195.10]  from inventory
[3195.10 --> 3196.04]  with a real system
[3196.04 --> 3196.98]  for tracking that
[3196.98 --> 3198.30]  to testing
[3198.30 --> 3199.64]  to shooting
[3199.64 --> 3200.70]  to b-roll
[3200.70 --> 3201.96]  and then back to inventory
[3201.96 --> 3203.06]  I expect organization
[3203.06 --> 3204.16]  that's the biggest difference
[3204.16 --> 3204.58]  awesome
[3204.58 --> 3205.36]  alright
[3205.36 --> 3205.94]  next
[3205.94 --> 3209.52]  sup
[3209.52 --> 3211.22]  welcome to the WAN show
[3211.22 --> 3212.16]  thank you
[3212.16 --> 3212.66]  um
[3212.66 --> 3213.50]  hi everybody
[3213.50 --> 3214.18]  my name is Maxwell
[3214.18 --> 3215.22]  um
[3215.22 --> 3216.70]  about a month and a half ago
[3216.70 --> 3217.40]  you guys got to about
[3217.40 --> 3218.24]  8,600 viewers
[3218.24 --> 3219.24]  and you're like
[3219.24 --> 3219.78]  oh my god
[3219.78 --> 3221.00]  we're almost over 9,000
[3221.00 --> 3221.86]  and then
[3221.86 --> 3222.96]  you guys said
[3222.96 --> 3223.96]  well this is gonna be
[3223.96 --> 3224.52]  a great idea
[3224.52 --> 3225.46]  like how about we have
[3225.46 --> 3226.74]  a huge surprise show
[3226.74 --> 3227.82]  when we get over 9,000 viewers
[3227.82 --> 3229.22]  and then you guys ended up
[3229.22 --> 3230.12]  getting to like 10k
[3230.12 --> 3231.48]  a couple of weeks ago
[3231.48 --> 3232.70]  and I didn't find out
[3232.70 --> 3233.34]  what the idea was
[3233.34 --> 3234.08]  that I've been waiting for
[3234.08 --> 3235.50]  so what was the great idea
[3235.50 --> 3236.54]  for over 9,000 viewers
[3236.54 --> 3237.06]  on a WAN show
[3237.06 --> 3238.06]  I don't know
[3238.06 --> 3238.96]  hey Luke
[3238.96 --> 3240.68]  did we ever figure out
[3240.68 --> 3241.36]  what we were gonna do
[3241.36 --> 3242.02]  for over 9-
[3242.02 --> 3242.56]  he asked me this
[3242.56 --> 3243.18]  before we came in
[3243.18 --> 3243.58]  so I was wondering
[3243.58 --> 3244.08]  if you knew
[3244.08 --> 3245.22]  no I don't remember
[3245.22 --> 3246.64]  we apparently said that
[3246.64 --> 3247.76]  I don't remember saying it at all
[3247.76 --> 3249.14]  we apparently said that
[3249.14 --> 3250.32]  and I have
[3250.32 --> 3251.00]  no I'm worried
[3251.00 --> 3251.12]  hold on
[3251.12 --> 3252.74]  that is so cool
[3252.74 --> 3256.04]  maybe
[3256.04 --> 3257.64]  do we have any
[3257.64 --> 3258.00]  no
[3258.00 --> 3260.40]  we totally forgot
[3260.40 --> 3261.40]  thank you for asking
[3261.40 --> 3262.26]  we can do it though
[3262.26 --> 3265.16]  I think I might know
[3265.16 --> 3266.30]  but
[3266.30 --> 3267.08]  but
[3267.08 --> 3268.80]  it might have been
[3268.80 --> 3270.08]  it
[3270.08 --> 3270.42]  okay
[3270.42 --> 3270.84]  I'll just
[3270.84 --> 3271.44]  I'll just tell you
[3271.44 --> 3272.42]  it might have been
[3272.42 --> 3273.98]  like blonde spiky wigs
[3273.98 --> 3275.04]  like Super Saiyan
[3275.04 --> 3275.52]  yes
[3275.52 --> 3276.82]  I think that might have been
[3276.82 --> 3277.30]  the idea
[3277.30 --> 3278.10]  but I'm not sure
[3278.10 --> 3278.64]  okay
[3278.64 --> 3278.98]  so
[3278.98 --> 3280.10]  sorry we failed you
[3280.10 --> 3280.64]  that's alright
[3280.64 --> 3281.48]  alright who's next
[3281.48 --> 3282.82]  I think we didn't expect it
[3282.82 --> 3283.70]  to happen very quickly
[3283.70 --> 3284.56]  no I really
[3284.56 --> 3285.54]  I don't know if I ever
[3285.54 --> 3286.46]  expected it to happen
[3286.46 --> 3287.88]  but WAN show's kind of
[3287.88 --> 3288.42]  been like that
[3288.42 --> 3289.24]  like the first time
[3289.24 --> 3290.54]  we broke a thousand viewers
[3290.54 --> 3291.12]  I was like
[3291.12 --> 3291.58]  whoa
[3291.58 --> 3293.76]  and now we're sitting at
[3293.76 --> 3294.40]  8,900
[3294.40 --> 3296.30]  for a Twitter blitz
[3296.30 --> 3297.24]  well
[3297.24 --> 3298.16]  sort of Twitter
[3298.16 --> 3299.26]  are you even on Twitter
[3299.26 --> 3300.32]  barely
[3300.32 --> 3301.24]  there you go
[3301.24 --> 3301.96]  alright what's up
[3301.96 --> 3303.48]  I was wondering
[3303.48 --> 3304.68]  which of your employees
[3304.68 --> 3306.40]  you think works the hardest
[3306.40 --> 3307.54]  wow me
[3307.54 --> 3311.54]  that's pretty good
[3311.54 --> 3312.94]  that's all
[3312.94 --> 3317.90]  it's Brandon
[3317.90 --> 3318.70]  it's Brandon
[3318.70 --> 3319.42]  it's Brandon
[3319.42 --> 3320.60]  could be Brandon
[3320.60 --> 3322.34]  could be Brandon
[3322.34 --> 3323.82]  could be Luke
[3323.82 --> 3324.56]  could be Nick
[3324.56 --> 3325.52]  you know what
[3325.52 --> 3327.40]  everyone here works really hard
[3327.40 --> 3327.98]  if they didn't
[3327.98 --> 3328.70]  they wouldn't last
[3328.70 --> 3330.46]  period
[3330.46 --> 3331.96]  we had one guy
[3331.96 --> 3332.96]  who lasted like
[3332.96 --> 3333.72]  two weeks
[3333.72 --> 3336.28]  and he fell asleep
[3336.28 --> 3337.04]  at work once
[3337.04 --> 3337.58]  and stuff
[3337.58 --> 3338.80]  and so
[3338.80 --> 3339.62]  our culture
[3339.62 --> 3340.62]  is one of
[3340.62 --> 3342.02]  work extremely hard
[3342.02 --> 3344.32]  play extremely hard
[3344.32 --> 3346.90]  but everyone here
[3346.90 --> 3347.98]  works incredibly hard
[3347.98 --> 3349.38]  who's next
[3349.38 --> 3351.74]  I hope I last two weeks
[3351.74 --> 3352.70]  it's a two person
[3352.70 --> 3353.46]  oh
[3353.46 --> 3354.46]  so
[3354.46 --> 3358.62]  so Linus
[3358.62 --> 3360.78]  when's the next meetup
[3360.78 --> 3361.28]  happening
[3361.28 --> 3362.28]  wow
[3362.28 --> 3363.22]  great question
[3363.22 --> 3363.80]  um
[3363.80 --> 3365.32]  so
[3365.32 --> 3366.64]  the last time
[3366.64 --> 3368.12]  I did a formal meetup
[3368.12 --> 3368.76]  I think
[3368.76 --> 3369.32]  was
[3369.32 --> 3369.96]  he's fine
[3369.96 --> 3370.28]  get out
[3370.28 --> 3370.90]  get out
[3370.90 --> 3371.12]  get out
[3371.12 --> 3372.38]  get out
[3372.38 --> 3373.00]  get out
[3373.00 --> 3373.02]  get out
[3373.02 --> 3373.12]  get out
[3373.12 --> 3374.48]  the last time
[3374.48 --> 3375.26]  I did a formal
[3375.26 --> 3377.04]  like an actually formal
[3377.04 --> 3377.42]  meetup
[3377.42 --> 3377.78]  I think
[3377.78 --> 3379.50]  was an NCIX event
[3379.50 --> 3380.94]  where we had
[3380.94 --> 3382.78]  three projectors
[3382.78 --> 3384.16]  3D projectors
[3384.16 --> 3385.08]  running
[3385.08 --> 3386.38]  in Nvidia surround
[3386.38 --> 3389.24]  powered by a couple of GTX 590s
[3389.24 --> 3390.42]  that
[3390.42 --> 3391.36]  was BA
[3391.36 --> 3393.26]  and I only probably had
[3393.26 --> 3394.60]  like 30 people show up
[3394.60 --> 3395.02]  for that
[3395.02 --> 3396.92]  so I kind of gave up on them
[3396.92 --> 3399.92]  oh
[3399.92 --> 3401.80]  Kingston HyperX paintball
[3401.80 --> 3403.18]  was sort of a meetup
[3403.18 --> 3403.90]  but it
[3403.90 --> 3404.80]  it was also
[3404.80 --> 3405.14]  yeah
[3405.14 --> 3406.06]  the guys that were there
[3406.06 --> 3406.74]  were awesome
[3406.74 --> 3407.46]  it was also
[3407.46 --> 3408.52]  like a shoot
[3408.52 --> 3410.42]  and so the people that came
[3410.42 --> 3411.76]  had to like
[3411.76 --> 3413.04]  be in a video
[3413.04 --> 3413.58]  and stuff
[3413.58 --> 3414.40]  so okay
[3414.40 --> 3416.06]  I had forgotten about that one
[3416.06 --> 3416.44]  because
[3416.44 --> 3418.36]  that day was a freaking blur
[3418.36 --> 3419.78]  I was coordinating a meetup
[3419.78 --> 3422.00]  like starring in the video
[3422.00 --> 3423.72]  and coordinating the video shoot
[3423.72 --> 3424.54]  all in one day
[3424.54 --> 3425.24]  like it was
[3425.24 --> 3426.60]  bananas
[3426.60 --> 3427.74]  yeah yes
[3427.74 --> 3430.58]  I did not intend for shoot to be a pun
[3430.58 --> 3430.94]  but
[3430.94 --> 3433.58]  I'm glad it happened
[3433.58 --> 3435.70]  did I do one at PAX 2013?
[3435.96 --> 3436.10]  you did
[3436.10 --> 3437.00]  oh okay
[3437.00 --> 3438.76]  that was like the photo booth thing
[3438.76 --> 3440.50]  I wouldn't call that a formal meetup
[3440.50 --> 3441.44]  it was like
[3441.44 --> 3442.64]  you should just get the WAN bus
[3442.64 --> 3443.52]  and go across Canada
[3443.52 --> 3444.18]  yeah we need to
[3444.18 --> 3445.52]  we totally need a WAN bus
[3445.52 --> 3445.78]  yeah
[3445.78 --> 3447.08]  as long as we don't accidentally
[3447.08 --> 3448.20]  put a G on the end
[3448.20 --> 3449.30]  then some
[3449.30 --> 3450.14]  the WAN bus
[3450.14 --> 3450.40]  yeah
[3450.40 --> 3453.00]  yeah the WAN bus
[3453.00 --> 3453.96]  okay what do you got?
[3454.16 --> 3455.54]  where do you see Linus Tech Tips
[3455.54 --> 3456.24]  in five years?
[3456.42 --> 3456.92]  where do I see
[3456.92 --> 3457.96]  okay great question
[3457.96 --> 3458.38]  go away
[3458.38 --> 3460.12]  and let's get the next one
[3460.12 --> 3460.60]  right in there
[3460.60 --> 3461.56]  let's get these going quick
[3461.56 --> 3462.42]  so
[3462.42 --> 3464.38]  Linus Tech Tips
[3464.38 --> 3465.52]  in five years
[3465.52 --> 3466.82]  I don't even know about five years
[3466.82 --> 3467.68]  but I'll do two years
[3467.68 --> 3467.96]  okay
[3467.96 --> 3469.34]  so
[3469.34 --> 3471.00]  YouTube
[3471.00 --> 3473.52]  I have seen many
[3473.52 --> 3475.30]  YouTube personalities
[3475.30 --> 3476.64]  come and go
[3476.64 --> 3477.74]  throughout
[3477.74 --> 3478.78]  my
[3478.78 --> 3480.50]  like I've never really done
[3480.50 --> 3481.26]  the explosive
[3481.26 --> 3482.54]  exponential growth
[3482.54 --> 3483.18]  thing
[3483.18 --> 3485.18]  but I've also never leveled off
[3485.18 --> 3486.02]  it's always been like
[3486.02 --> 3486.72]  a slow and steady
[3486.72 --> 3487.38]  wins the race
[3487.38 --> 3487.80]  and I've
[3487.80 --> 3489.38]  I've seen a lot of guys
[3489.38 --> 3490.78]  that I used to look up to
[3490.78 --> 3491.72]  and wonder how I could
[3491.72 --> 3493.08]  ever be as big as them
[3493.08 --> 3493.96]  I've
[3493.96 --> 3495.52]  I've seen a lot of those guys
[3495.52 --> 3497.10]  fall behind
[3497.10 --> 3498.30]  in terms of their
[3498.30 --> 3499.72]  their YouTube audience anyway
[3499.72 --> 3501.08]  um
[3501.08 --> 3502.94]  and I think
[3502.94 --> 3504.52]  there are a lot of
[3504.52 --> 3505.34]  different reasons
[3505.34 --> 3506.02]  it's happened
[3506.02 --> 3506.44]  you know
[3506.44 --> 3507.58]  YouTube has changed
[3507.58 --> 3509.22]  the audience has changed
[3509.22 --> 3509.96]  uh
[3509.96 --> 3511.64]  the technology has changed
[3511.64 --> 3513.38]  everything is always changing
[3513.38 --> 3514.20]  and
[3514.20 --> 3515.48]  the old formula
[3515.48 --> 3517.60]  is not going to work
[3517.60 --> 3518.14]  forever
[3518.14 --> 3520.14]  and that is why
[3520.14 --> 3522.22]  even though it was a huge risk
[3522.22 --> 3523.00]  we
[3523.00 --> 3524.28]  killed unboxings
[3524.28 --> 3526.16]  we stopped doing unboxings
[3526.16 --> 3527.94]  that was our bread and butter
[3527.94 --> 3529.00]  it was the single
[3529.00 --> 3529.90]  most
[3529.90 --> 3530.86]  viewed
[3530.86 --> 3532.10]  and therefore
[3532.10 --> 3533.36]  profitable thing
[3533.36 --> 3534.60]  that we did as a company
[3534.60 --> 3535.90]  and here I was
[3535.90 --> 3536.82]  I took this enormous
[3536.82 --> 3537.44]  leap of faith
[3537.44 --> 3538.18]  I was like okay
[3538.18 --> 3539.78]  I'm tired of this
[3539.78 --> 3540.98]  that means the audience
[3540.98 --> 3541.88]  must be tired of it
[3541.88 --> 3542.68]  if I'm tired of it
[3542.68 --> 3543.08]  so let's
[3543.08 --> 3543.72]  let's do it
[3543.72 --> 3544.30]  let's kill it
[3544.30 --> 3545.50]  all we do now
[3545.50 --> 3546.14]  is reviews
[3546.14 --> 3546.80]  and projects
[3546.80 --> 3547.28]  and
[3547.28 --> 3548.18]  and showcases
[3548.18 --> 3549.00]  so
[3549.00 --> 3550.26]  so we killed unboxings
[3550.26 --> 3551.24]  we switched to almost
[3551.24 --> 3552.26]  entirely reviews
[3552.26 --> 3552.86]  at that time
[3552.86 --> 3555.18]  we are actually in the middle
[3555.18 --> 3557.94]  of yet another reinvention
[3557.94 --> 3558.76]  right now
[3558.76 --> 3559.18]  um
[3559.18 --> 3560.44]  some of you might have noticed
[3560.44 --> 3562.28]  we are going to be
[3562.28 --> 3563.26]  gradually
[3563.26 --> 3564.58]  we're still going to do reviews
[3564.58 --> 3566.40]  but we are gradually
[3566.40 --> 3567.74]  making it
[3567.74 --> 3568.82]  not all about the reviews
[3568.82 --> 3569.42]  I see him
[3569.42 --> 3570.52]  I have a preview of the video
[3570.52 --> 3571.18]  right in front of me
[3571.18 --> 3572.12]  we are
[3572.12 --> 3573.66]  we are gradually moving away
[3573.66 --> 3574.72]  from just reviews
[3574.72 --> 3576.62]  to more projects
[3576.62 --> 3577.30]  and like
[3577.30 --> 3578.74]  crazy over the top
[3578.74 --> 3579.74]  you know
[3579.74 --> 3581.02]  showcases and stuff
[3581.02 --> 3582.80]  and more of
[3582.80 --> 3584.30]  making Linus Tech Tips
[3584.30 --> 3584.74]  like this
[3584.74 --> 3585.82]  this is like the dream
[3585.82 --> 3586.30]  for me
[3586.30 --> 3587.90]  making Linus Tech Tips
[3587.90 --> 3589.24]  a show
[3589.24 --> 3591.02]  about technology
[3591.02 --> 3592.88]  rather than
[3592.88 --> 3594.14]  a technology
[3594.14 --> 3595.34]  unboxing
[3595.34 --> 3596.32]  or review
[3596.32 --> 3596.92]  show
[3596.92 --> 3597.96]  so
[3597.96 --> 3599.48]  I don't want it
[3599.48 --> 3600.30]  to live within
[3600.30 --> 3601.34]  the confines
[3601.34 --> 3601.98]  of
[3601.98 --> 3603.60]  this is what we do
[3603.60 --> 3605.06]  I want us to just
[3605.06 --> 3606.74]  do whatever it is
[3606.74 --> 3608.16]  and I want people
[3608.16 --> 3608.90]  to watch it
[3608.90 --> 3609.72]  and enjoy it
[3609.72 --> 3611.58]  and that is why
[3611.58 --> 3612.98]  I have expanded
[3612.98 --> 3613.72]  our staff
[3613.72 --> 3615.78]  and grown the company
[3615.78 --> 3617.28]  the way that I have
[3617.28 --> 3618.78]  because if it was still
[3618.78 --> 3619.44]  just me
[3619.44 --> 3620.14]  or just me
[3620.14 --> 3621.08]  and a camera person
[3621.08 --> 3622.48]  something like
[3622.48 --> 3623.28]  Scrapyard Wars
[3623.28 --> 3624.04]  is impossible
[3624.04 --> 3625.98]  because that takes
[3625.98 --> 3627.22]  a big crew of people
[3627.22 --> 3628.18]  to make happen
[3628.18 --> 3629.48]  it takes an enormous
[3629.48 --> 3630.36]  amount of time
[3630.36 --> 3631.28]  stuff like
[3631.28 --> 3632.40]  New Office Vlog
[3632.40 --> 3633.56]  which kind of
[3633.56 --> 3634.18]  accidentally
[3634.18 --> 3634.90]  turned into
[3634.90 --> 3636.18]  kind of a reality show
[3636.18 --> 3638.36]  that everyone loved
[3638.36 --> 3639.42]  would have been impossible
[3639.42 --> 3640.58]  stuff like Luke
[3640.58 --> 3641.22]  wants to do
[3641.22 --> 3642.12]  where we DIY
[3642.12 --> 3643.00]  solar panels
[3643.00 --> 3643.52]  on the roof
[3643.52 --> 3644.22]  of the office
[3644.22 --> 3645.80]  would be impossible
[3645.80 --> 3647.32]  if we didn't have
[3647.32 --> 3647.94]  our own
[3647.94 --> 3649.66]  paid camera crew
[3649.66 --> 3650.90]  on staff
[3650.90 --> 3651.94]  in the office
[3651.94 --> 3652.90]  every day
[3652.90 --> 3653.58]  so
[3653.58 --> 3654.54]  you know
[3654.54 --> 3655.98]  it's so
[3655.98 --> 3657.00]  cliched
[3657.00 --> 3658.52]  but I really want
[3658.52 --> 3659.32]  Linus Tech Tips
[3659.32 --> 3660.70]  to be a technology show
[3660.70 --> 3661.70]  the same way
[3661.70 --> 3662.36]  that Top Gear
[3662.36 --> 3663.16]  is a car show
[3663.16 --> 3664.74]  it's not a car show
[3664.74 --> 3666.66]  it's just a show
[3666.66 --> 3667.38]  it's well
[3667.38 --> 3667.78]  not anymore
[3667.78 --> 3668.24]  it's anything
[3668.24 --> 3668.56]  but
[3668.56 --> 3669.40]  but
[3669.40 --> 3670.22]  but what it was
[3670.22 --> 3671.74]  was an entertaining show
[3671.74 --> 3673.04]  with great personalities
[3673.04 --> 3674.36]  and the cars
[3674.36 --> 3675.26]  were happy to be along
[3675.26 --> 3675.90]  for the ride
[3675.90 --> 3677.14]  so that's what I want
[3677.14 --> 3677.64]  this to be
[3677.64 --> 3678.42]  and I think that
[3678.42 --> 3679.28]  the group that we've
[3679.28 --> 3679.84]  built here
[3679.84 --> 3680.70]  and the
[3680.70 --> 3681.78]  the workflow
[3681.78 --> 3682.64]  that we've built here
[3682.64 --> 3683.92]  will enable us to do that
[3683.92 --> 3684.50]  and that's what I want
[3684.50 --> 3685.32]  Linus Tech Tips to be
[3685.32 --> 3687.20]  what can I do for you
[3687.20 --> 3687.80]  Linus
[3687.80 --> 3688.92]  why are there no fire poles
[3688.92 --> 3689.60]  in the new place
[3689.60 --> 3690.68]  there are no fire poles
[3690.68 --> 3692.08]  because it was hard enough
[3692.08 --> 3693.32]  to get our safety inspection
[3693.32 --> 3695.32]  past with a handrail
[3695.32 --> 3696.56]  on that stupid staircase
[3696.56 --> 3697.80]  let alone a fire pole
[3697.80 --> 3699.08]  on the outside of it
[3699.08 --> 3700.54]  so uh
[3700.54 --> 3701.68]  what's your favorite series
[3701.68 --> 3702.56]  that you've ever done
[3702.56 --> 3704.54]  my personal favorite
[3704.54 --> 3705.86]  great question
[3705.86 --> 3706.44]  um
[3706.44 --> 3706.92]  wow
[3706.92 --> 3710.30]  my personal favorite
[3710.30 --> 3714.22]  it's gotta be
[3714.22 --> 3714.96]  Scrapyard Wars
[3714.96 --> 3715.54]  um
[3715.54 --> 3717.44]  it's a lot of fun
[3717.44 --> 3717.96]  to shoot
[3717.96 --> 3719.08]  um
[3719.08 --> 3720.48]  it's a lot of fun
[3720.48 --> 3721.00]  to watch
[3721.00 --> 3721.32]  like
[3721.32 --> 3722.54]  even though
[3722.54 --> 3723.22]  cause I'm in
[3723.22 --> 3724.28]  a lot of our videos
[3724.28 --> 3724.62]  duh
[3724.62 --> 3725.44]  uh
[3725.44 --> 3726.48]  but Scrapyard Wars
[3726.48 --> 3727.88]  is so fun
[3727.88 --> 3728.70]  for me to watch
[3728.70 --> 3729.62]  because
[3729.62 --> 3730.70]  it's like
[3730.70 --> 3731.88]  it's like
[3731.88 --> 3732.98]  the highlight reel
[3732.98 --> 3734.04]  of that
[3734.04 --> 3734.96]  enormous amount
[3734.96 --> 3735.40]  of time
[3735.40 --> 3735.90]  that I spent
[3735.90 --> 3736.60]  on it for me
[3736.60 --> 3737.60]  and
[3737.60 --> 3738.98]  I get to enjoy
[3738.98 --> 3740.16]  the struggle
[3740.16 --> 3741.62]  and the triumph
[3741.62 --> 3742.56]  that's going on
[3742.56 --> 3743.36]  opposite me
[3743.36 --> 3744.08]  that I'm completely
[3744.08 --> 3744.74]  oblivious to
[3744.74 --> 3745.34]  the whole time
[3745.34 --> 3746.50]  so it's a lot of fun
[3746.50 --> 3747.22]  for me to watch
[3747.22 --> 3749.64]  what would you have
[3749.64 --> 3750.40]  done if
[3750.40 --> 3751.88]  Darren died
[3751.88 --> 3752.72]  Darren
[3752.72 --> 3754.64]  who's Darren
[3754.64 --> 3755.52]  specifically
[3755.52 --> 3756.20]  I know a lot of
[3756.20 --> 3758.72]  Darren the 3D printer
[3758.72 --> 3760.48]  well Darren did die
[3760.48 --> 3761.76]  fortunately Luke
[3761.76 --> 3762.74]  resurrected him
[3762.74 --> 3765.08]  so uh
[3765.08 --> 3766.10]  we're changing his name
[3766.10 --> 3767.30]  to Lazarus Lafreniere
[3767.30 --> 3768.70]  and uh
[3768.70 --> 3769.34]  wait no
[3769.34 --> 3770.22]  Darren we're changing
[3770.22 --> 3771.02]  to Lazarus
[3771.02 --> 3771.82]  Luke's name
[3771.82 --> 3772.26]  we're changing
[3772.26 --> 3772.84]  to something
[3772.84 --> 3773.82]  hopefully unoffensive
[3773.82 --> 3775.60]  so
[3775.60 --> 3777.58]  let's just move on
[3777.58 --> 3778.04]  from that
[3778.04 --> 3778.86]  that question
[3778.86 --> 3779.66]  what can I do for you
[3779.66 --> 3780.36]  nice shirt
[3780.36 --> 3780.88]  thanks
[3780.88 --> 3783.36]  in the little time
[3783.36 --> 3784.36]  that you get to have
[3784.36 --> 3786.28]  now they can see your shirt
[3786.28 --> 3787.88]  in the little free time
[3787.88 --> 3788.58]  that you get to have
[3788.58 --> 3789.52]  what is your favorite
[3789.52 --> 3790.46]  thing to do
[3790.46 --> 3791.20]  um
[3791.20 --> 3792.08]  I have very little time
[3792.08 --> 3792.62]  for anything
[3792.62 --> 3793.76]  in the little time
[3793.76 --> 3794.44]  that I have
[3794.44 --> 3795.44]  my kids are
[3795.44 --> 3797.20]  the light of my life
[3797.20 --> 3797.82]  so
[3797.82 --> 3798.78]  yep
[3798.78 --> 3799.78]  my kids are awesome
[3799.78 --> 3801.18]  that's uh
[3801.18 --> 3801.74]  that's what I do
[3801.74 --> 3802.38]  when I'm not here
[3802.38 --> 3804.74]  and sometimes I eat
[3804.74 --> 3806.94]  how are you today
[3806.94 --> 3808.20]  I am fantastic
[3808.20 --> 3809.20]  thank you for asking
[3809.20 --> 3809.76]  uh
[3809.76 --> 3810.82]  my question is
[3810.82 --> 3812.00]  about Ant Venom actually
[3812.00 --> 3812.50]  really
[3812.50 --> 3813.58]  what were your thoughts
[3813.58 --> 3814.16]  on when
[3814.16 --> 3815.48]  he said he was gonna come
[3815.48 --> 3816.18]  and then his flight
[3816.18 --> 3816.80]  being cancelled
[3816.80 --> 3818.86]  I was super bummed out
[3818.86 --> 3819.58]  because
[3819.58 --> 3820.58]  Ant Venom
[3820.58 --> 3821.64]  is like
[3821.64 --> 3823.18]  such
[3823.18 --> 3824.38]  an amazing
[3824.38 --> 3825.64]  Linus Tech Tips fan
[3825.64 --> 3826.46]  I don't know if you guys know
[3826.46 --> 3827.26]  Ant Venom's got like
[3827.26 --> 3828.52]  2 million bazillion
[3828.52 --> 3829.66]  subscribers on YouTube
[3829.66 --> 3831.20]  big deal
[3831.20 --> 3832.60]  he was gonna show up
[3832.60 --> 3833.18]  and I was like
[3833.18 --> 3833.84]  wow
[3833.84 --> 3835.60]  that would be super cool
[3835.60 --> 3837.00]  to have like
[3837.00 --> 3839.40]  other huge content creators
[3839.40 --> 3840.06]  show up
[3840.06 --> 3841.20]  at our fan event
[3841.20 --> 3842.72]  as like a huge bonus
[3842.72 --> 3843.68]  for the people here
[3843.68 --> 3844.48]  and just
[3844.48 --> 3846.26]  for me to shoot the breeze with
[3846.26 --> 3847.02]  because I
[3847.02 --> 3848.36]  living in Vancouver
[3848.36 --> 3850.14]  there's not a lot of huge YouTubers here
[3850.14 --> 3851.44]  and huge streamers here
[3851.44 --> 3852.20]  it's
[3852.20 --> 3852.54]  it's
[3852.54 --> 3853.80]  it's a pretty desolate place
[3853.80 --> 3854.46]  there are a couple
[3854.46 --> 3855.52]  but
[3855.52 --> 3856.74]  like if I wanted
[3856.74 --> 3857.56]  yeah
[3857.56 --> 3858.28]  yeah
[3858.28 --> 3859.18]  if I want to like
[3859.18 --> 3860.18]  hang out with
[3860.18 --> 3861.02]  guys that are
[3861.02 --> 3862.26]  that are absolutely huge
[3862.26 --> 3862.94]  and
[3862.94 --> 3864.30]  guys that are like
[3864.30 --> 3865.86]  totally in my headspace
[3865.86 --> 3867.38]  Ant Venom is one of the few
[3867.38 --> 3868.38]  that exists out there
[3868.38 --> 3869.60]  and what I mean by
[3869.60 --> 3870.42]  totally in my headspace
[3870.42 --> 3871.00]  is
[3871.00 --> 3871.76]  it's funny
[3871.76 --> 3872.96]  because gamers
[3872.96 --> 3874.14]  and like
[3874.14 --> 3875.72]  IT technophiles
[3875.72 --> 3877.02]  they're kind of like
[3877.02 --> 3878.26]  they're like the Venn diagram
[3878.26 --> 3878.66]  right
[3878.66 --> 3879.66]  like there's the overlap
[3879.66 --> 3881.00]  but a lot of the time
[3881.00 --> 3881.70]  the guys building
[3881.70 --> 3882.84]  the beast gaming rigs
[3882.84 --> 3883.40]  are not
[3883.40 --> 3883.98]  actually
[3883.98 --> 3884.96]  hardcore gamers
[3884.96 --> 3886.24]  like me
[3886.24 --> 3887.44]  and the guys
[3887.44 --> 3888.84]  that are the hardcore gamers
[3888.84 --> 3890.34]  are not that tech savvy
[3890.34 --> 3891.96]  they just buy a pre-built machine
[3891.96 --> 3892.46]  and it's done
[3892.46 --> 3892.96]  right
[3892.96 --> 3894.56]  so Ant Venom
[3894.56 --> 3895.76]  actually took
[3895.76 --> 3897.86]  our whole room water cooling concept
[3897.86 --> 3899.78]  amped it up a notch
[3899.78 --> 3901.40]  and has his gaming machine
[3901.40 --> 3903.14]  on a separate floor of his house
[3903.14 --> 3905.06]  with his radiator in the basement
[3905.06 --> 3906.74]  but he did it up right
[3906.74 --> 3908.96]  he took everything we learned
[3908.96 --> 3910.38]  every mistake we made
[3910.38 --> 3911.76]  and he published a video
[3911.76 --> 3913.54]  on his gaming centric channel
[3913.54 --> 3915.20]  of his recreation
[3915.20 --> 3916.92]  of whole room water cooling
[3916.92 --> 3918.42]  which works
[3918.42 --> 3920.26]  it actually gets the heat
[3920.26 --> 3921.08]  out of the room
[3921.08 --> 3921.90]  successfully
[3921.90 --> 3922.92]  because he didn't use
[3922.92 --> 3924.20]  a huge array of copper tubing
[3924.20 --> 3924.60]  to do it
[3924.60 --> 3926.48]  he's just got a nice short run
[3926.48 --> 3927.36]  right through the floor
[3927.36 --> 3929.16]  he used a plastic reservoir
[3929.16 --> 3930.74]  a lesson that we learned
[3930.74 --> 3932.24]  about anti-corrosive additives
[3932.24 --> 3933.54]  and how they don't always work
[3933.54 --> 3934.30]  so
[3934.30 --> 3935.94]  his video is badass
[3935.94 --> 3937.84]  I was hoping for him to be here
[3937.84 --> 3939.00]  and hang out on the WAN show
[3939.00 --> 3939.88]  but
[3939.88 --> 3940.46]  hey
[3940.46 --> 3941.22]  the effort
[3941.22 --> 3942.40]  totally counts
[3942.40 --> 3944.12]  and we're sorry you couldn't be here
[3944.12 --> 3945.72]  alright you're up
[3945.72 --> 3947.72]  so how scary was it
[3947.72 --> 3948.42]  to take a chance
[3948.42 --> 3949.06]  and start your own business
[3949.06 --> 3949.84]  doing what you do
[3949.84 --> 3950.68]  it was mortifying
[3950.68 --> 3951.90]  I mean this is something
[3951.90 --> 3953.20]  I'm not sure
[3953.20 --> 3954.66]  if I've talked about before
[3954.66 --> 3956.80]  but Linus Media Group
[3956.80 --> 3958.44]  almost completely
[3958.44 --> 3959.88]  ran out of money
[3959.88 --> 3961.18]  four months in
[3961.18 --> 3962.38]  so I don't know
[3962.38 --> 3963.16]  if you guys are
[3963.16 --> 3964.66]  super business savvy
[3964.66 --> 3967.58]  but the way that it works
[3967.58 --> 3969.32]  is even if you have a sponsor
[3969.32 --> 3971.28]  like Intel
[3971.28 --> 3973.14]  or whoever
[3973.14 --> 3974.94]  especially a big sponsor
[3974.94 --> 3976.82]  they don't expect
[3976.82 --> 3977.82]  to prepay
[3977.82 --> 3978.70]  for things
[3978.70 --> 3980.30]  so they expect
[3980.30 --> 3981.80]  to reach an agreement
[3981.80 --> 3983.20]  sign a contract
[3983.20 --> 3983.90]  like okay
[3983.90 --> 3984.62]  we're gonna have you
[3984.62 --> 3985.56]  mention our product
[3985.56 --> 3986.72]  in the first 30 seconds
[3986.72 --> 3987.54]  of your video
[3987.54 --> 3988.88]  10 times
[3988.88 --> 3989.82]  in the month of
[3989.82 --> 3990.80]  you know
[3990.80 --> 3991.46]  February
[3991.46 --> 3993.26]  and then once you've
[3993.26 --> 3994.48]  executed the contract
[3994.48 --> 3996.20]  they expect what's called
[3996.20 --> 3996.86]  net terms
[3996.86 --> 3998.40]  so that is
[3998.40 --> 4000.60]  they pay after completion
[4000.60 --> 4001.58]  that gives them time
[4001.58 --> 4002.80]  to process it in accounting
[4002.80 --> 4004.10]  and get you know
[4004.10 --> 4005.18]  the necessary signatures
[4005.18 --> 4005.80]  and all that stuff
[4005.80 --> 4006.52]  and I get it
[4006.52 --> 4007.82]  but it means that
[4007.82 --> 4009.44]  even though Linus Media Group
[4009.44 --> 4011.02]  was working hard
[4011.02 --> 4012.08]  to obtain sponsors
[4012.08 --> 4013.84]  and all that stuff
[4013.84 --> 4016.28]  all without selling out
[4016.28 --> 4017.02]  I mean that's the thing
[4017.02 --> 4018.16]  is sell out is a word
[4018.16 --> 4019.44]  that gets thrown around a lot
[4019.44 --> 4020.38]  but it has a meaning
[4020.38 --> 4021.50]  that people don't understand
[4021.50 --> 4022.76]  sell out doesn't mean
[4022.76 --> 4023.40]  you make money
[4023.40 --> 4025.02]  we make money
[4025.02 --> 4026.92]  but sell out means
[4026.92 --> 4027.52]  making money
[4027.52 --> 4028.94]  by compromising your values
[4028.94 --> 4031.34]  so we have never
[4031.34 --> 4032.64]  taken money
[4032.64 --> 4033.92]  from Blue
[4033.92 --> 4035.46]  to review this microphone
[4035.46 --> 4036.92]  that will not happen
[4036.92 --> 4038.50]  we can take money
[4038.50 --> 4039.14]  from Blue
[4039.14 --> 4040.36]  to put their microphone
[4040.36 --> 4041.72]  in front of our camera
[4041.72 --> 4042.98]  while we host the WAN show
[4042.98 --> 4044.56]  that is sponsorship
[4044.56 --> 4046.80]  that is a product placement
[4046.80 --> 4048.52]  that is completely separate
[4048.52 --> 4050.24]  we will give
[4050.24 --> 4051.56]  a bad review
[4051.56 --> 4052.52]  to a sponsor
[4052.52 --> 4053.68]  if they submit a product
[4053.68 --> 4054.46]  to us for a review
[4054.46 --> 4055.36]  we have to keep
[4055.36 --> 4056.78]  our content
[4056.78 --> 4058.32]  which has no value
[4058.32 --> 4059.00]  to our viewers
[4059.00 --> 4059.72]  and therefore
[4059.72 --> 4060.36]  no value
[4060.36 --> 4061.16]  to a future sponsor
[4061.16 --> 4061.42]  I mean
[4061.42 --> 4063.96]  even if I was a terrible person
[4063.96 --> 4066.06]  I can't sell out
[4066.06 --> 4067.06]  on a product review
[4067.06 --> 4067.84]  because
[4067.84 --> 4069.42]  I have to be smart enough
[4069.42 --> 4069.96]  to know
[4069.96 --> 4071.36]  that if my audience
[4071.36 --> 4071.88]  can be
[4071.88 --> 4072.98]  10 years from now
[4072.98 --> 4074.00]  my audience could be
[4074.00 --> 4075.28]  10 times the size
[4075.28 --> 4076.34]  then I should be able
[4076.34 --> 4077.62]  to get 10 times the sponsors
[4077.62 --> 4078.78]  but my audience
[4078.78 --> 4079.58]  isn't going to grow
[4079.58 --> 4080.64]  if I give you people
[4080.64 --> 4082.10]  bad advice about technology
[4082.10 --> 4083.26]  and tell you the wrong thing
[4083.26 --> 4085.10]  even if I was a terrible
[4085.10 --> 4086.18]  money
[4086.18 --> 4087.14]  money is the only
[4087.14 --> 4087.98]  important thing to me
[4087.98 --> 4088.36]  person
[4088.36 --> 4089.92]  I still wouldn't do it
[4089.92 --> 4091.96]  so we had to
[4091.96 --> 4092.58]  even though
[4092.58 --> 4093.16]  we ran out
[4093.16 --> 4094.26]  and we got sponsors
[4094.26 --> 4095.04]  you know
[4095.04 --> 4095.66]  it's harder
[4095.66 --> 4096.60]  if you're not willing
[4096.60 --> 4097.32]  to sell out
[4097.32 --> 4098.56]  because you have to be like
[4098.56 --> 4098.96]  look
[4098.96 --> 4100.06]  this guarantees you
[4100.06 --> 4101.26]  no special treatment
[4101.26 --> 4102.42]  nothing
[4102.42 --> 4103.48]  you get nothing
[4103.48 --> 4104.64]  other than
[4104.64 --> 4106.56]  the advertising spot
[4106.56 --> 4107.42]  that we promise
[4107.42 --> 4108.66]  that's what you get
[4108.66 --> 4109.44]  that's it
[4109.44 --> 4110.86]  so we did it anyway
[4110.86 --> 4111.72]  it was hard work
[4111.72 --> 4112.34]  but we did it
[4112.34 --> 4114.20]  but I still had to wait
[4114.20 --> 4115.26]  anywhere from
[4115.26 --> 4117.90]  30 to 120 days
[4117.90 --> 4119.70]  for my first paychecks
[4119.70 --> 4122.42]  aside from things like YouTube
[4122.42 --> 4123.60]  which roll in monthly
[4123.60 --> 4124.64]  but isn't as much
[4124.64 --> 4125.24]  as you'd think
[4125.24 --> 4127.42]  and I took a risk
[4127.42 --> 4129.84]  Luke and Ed
[4129.84 --> 4131.94]  both took a risk too
[4131.94 --> 4132.92]  they dropped out
[4132.92 --> 4133.60]  of their programs
[4133.60 --> 4134.14]  in school
[4134.14 --> 4135.92]  because I promised
[4135.92 --> 4137.54]  that I would get the money
[4137.54 --> 4138.54]  to pay them
[4138.54 --> 4139.52]  and support them
[4139.52 --> 4140.52]  and we'd make a real company
[4140.52 --> 4141.20]  out of this thing
[4141.20 --> 4142.98]  so they both went for it
[4142.98 --> 4144.06]  and I went for it
[4144.06 --> 4146.38]  and in April
[4146.38 --> 4147.48]  of the first year
[4147.48 --> 4148.34]  of Linus Media Group
[4148.34 --> 4149.64]  we almost completely
[4149.64 --> 4150.44]  ran out of money
[4150.44 --> 4151.18]  like
[4151.18 --> 4152.56]  out
[4152.56 --> 4154.42]  like done
[4154.42 --> 4155.24]  like we were down
[4155.24 --> 4156.10]  to double digits
[4156.10 --> 4157.56]  in the account
[4157.56 --> 4159.18]  I didn't have another payroll
[4159.18 --> 4160.48]  and then the checks
[4160.48 --> 4161.12]  started arriving
[4161.12 --> 4162.42]  so
[4162.42 --> 4163.98]  it was down to the wire
[4163.98 --> 4164.46]  for us
[4164.46 --> 4165.40]  it was terrifying
[4165.40 --> 4166.62]  the good news
[4166.62 --> 4167.66]  about what we were doing
[4167.66 --> 4168.64]  is at least I had
[4168.64 --> 4169.84]  a lot of industry connections
[4169.84 --> 4171.24]  and that's another
[4171.24 --> 4172.04]  I mentioned this earlier
[4172.04 --> 4172.42]  on the show
[4172.42 --> 4173.66]  but I'll always be thankful
[4173.66 --> 4174.90]  for my time at NCIX
[4174.90 --> 4176.06]  for all the things I learned
[4176.06 --> 4176.86]  and
[4176.86 --> 4177.98]  I should have mentioned this
[4177.98 --> 4179.58]  all the amazing people I met
[4179.58 --> 4180.92]  many of whom
[4180.92 --> 4181.66]  like
[4181.66 --> 4182.64]  you know
[4182.64 --> 4184.48]  I really hope I don't miss anyone here
[4184.48 --> 4184.80]  but
[4184.80 --> 4186.88]  guys like Rick from Corsair
[4186.88 --> 4187.82]  that was
[4187.82 --> 4188.60]  Corsair
[4188.60 --> 4190.10]  was our first
[4190.10 --> 4191.80]  the first ones
[4191.80 --> 4192.52]  that ever wrote
[4192.52 --> 4193.56]  Linus Media Group
[4193.56 --> 4194.30]  incorporated
[4194.30 --> 4195.06]  a check
[4195.06 --> 4196.06]  was Corsair
[4196.06 --> 4198.04]  and
[4198.04 --> 4198.32]  and
[4198.32 --> 4198.94]  those guys
[4198.94 --> 4199.82]  those guys
[4199.82 --> 4200.92]  very special relationship
[4200.92 --> 4201.52]  that doesn't mean
[4201.52 --> 4202.04]  I won't give them
[4202.04 --> 4202.72]  a negative review
[4202.72 --> 4203.20]  or whatever
[4203.20 --> 4204.90]  guys like
[4204.90 --> 4206.00]  Fractal Design
[4206.00 --> 4206.94]  were on board
[4206.94 --> 4207.80]  very early on
[4207.80 --> 4208.72]  Josh from Fractal
[4208.72 --> 4209.50]  huge
[4209.50 --> 4210.12]  buddies
[4210.12 --> 4210.78]  you know
[4210.78 --> 4211.16]  it doesn't mean
[4211.16 --> 4212.12]  I won't rip on their products
[4212.12 --> 4212.70]  if they suck
[4212.70 --> 4214.48]  so
[4214.48 --> 4214.80]  those
[4214.80 --> 4215.54]  those early
[4215.54 --> 4216.44]  those early
[4216.44 --> 4217.22]  guys
[4217.22 --> 4217.88]  really helped us
[4217.88 --> 4218.24]  pull through
[4218.24 --> 4219.62]  what can I do for you
[4219.62 --> 4220.84]  what are you planning to print
[4220.84 --> 4221.52]  with your 3D printer
[4221.52 --> 4222.64]  that's actually practical
[4222.64 --> 4223.24]  okay
[4223.24 --> 4224.56]  the first practical thing
[4224.56 --> 4225.16]  you'll see printed
[4225.16 --> 4225.90]  is a shroud
[4225.90 --> 4227.40]  for our new router
[4227.40 --> 4229.12]  that is going to handle
[4229.12 --> 4230.78]  our new gigabit internet connection
[4230.78 --> 4232.84]  and it needs a cooling shroud
[4232.84 --> 4234.04]  because I built
[4234.04 --> 4235.52]  using standard components
[4235.52 --> 4236.70]  in a 1U case
[4236.70 --> 4238.08]  and we couldn't find a way
[4238.08 --> 4238.80]  to cool the CPU
[4238.80 --> 4240.52]  very well
[4240.52 --> 4241.58]  without that shroud
[4241.58 --> 4242.72]  which we hope works
[4242.72 --> 4243.46]  but we don't know yet
[4243.46 --> 4244.68]  hi there
[4244.68 --> 4245.02]  hi
[4245.02 --> 4246.30]  nice sunglasses
[4246.30 --> 4247.54]  we're sunglasses buddies
[4247.54 --> 4248.32]  alright thank you
[4248.32 --> 4250.50]  is there anything you regret
[4250.50 --> 4251.04]  about
[4251.04 --> 4252.84]  getting your own company
[4252.84 --> 4253.88]  with Linus Media Group
[4253.88 --> 4256.02]  and going out on your own
[4256.02 --> 4256.50]  rather than
[4256.50 --> 4257.30]  through NCIX
[4257.30 --> 4258.68]  um
[4258.68 --> 4260.56]  wow
[4260.56 --> 4261.16]  good question
[4261.16 --> 4262.68]  is there anything I regret
[4262.68 --> 4264.52]  I mean
[4264.52 --> 4265.60]  this ties really closely
[4265.60 --> 4266.00]  into the
[4266.00 --> 4266.62]  what do I like
[4266.62 --> 4267.58]  what do I not like
[4267.58 --> 4268.10]  question
[4268.10 --> 4268.72]  I mean
[4268.72 --> 4270.80]  I wish I didn't have to
[4270.80 --> 4271.44]  work so hard
[4271.44 --> 4271.98]  but like
[4271.98 --> 4274.18]  the fact that I get to
[4274.18 --> 4275.62]  I get to roll into
[4275.62 --> 4277.02]  my like
[4277.02 --> 4277.94]  parking spot
[4277.94 --> 4278.38]  that says
[4278.38 --> 4279.20]  Linus Media Group
[4279.20 --> 4280.14]  employees only
[4280.14 --> 4282.02]  and then I get to go inside
[4282.02 --> 4282.54]  and like
[4282.54 --> 4283.62]  hang out with Luke
[4283.62 --> 4284.12]  and Ed
[4284.12 --> 4284.70]  and Brandon
[4284.70 --> 4285.44]  and Taryn
[4285.44 --> 4286.12]  and Nick
[4286.12 --> 4287.66]  and other Nick
[4287.66 --> 4289.22]  and Colton
[4289.22 --> 4291.18]  and I'm gonna forget someone
[4291.18 --> 4291.86]  crap
[4291.86 --> 4293.38]  John
[4293.38 --> 4293.80]  yes
[4293.80 --> 4294.52]  thank you
[4294.52 --> 4296.30]  who else am I missing
[4296.30 --> 4297.04]  I'm sure I'm
[4297.04 --> 4297.40]  Dennis
[4297.40 --> 4298.68]  and Dennis
[4298.68 --> 4300.08]  I think I got everyone
[4300.08 --> 4300.96]  I mean
[4300.96 --> 4301.84]  it's amazing
[4301.84 --> 4302.58]  it's like
[4302.58 --> 4303.74]  the best job ever
[4303.74 --> 4304.48]  like
[4304.48 --> 4305.44]  you will not

[4306.30 --> 4307.92]  sometimes post pictures

[4308.76 --> 4310.48]  of like me still working
[4310.48 --> 4311.62]  on something at 3am

[4315.00 --> 4316.54]  this is what I'm up to
[4316.54 --> 4318.34]  because I have the best job on earth

[4319.64 --> 4320.40]  so

[4321.22 --> 4324.48]  well I have the best job on earth
[4324.48 --> 4325.40]  I don't speak for Ed
[4325.40 --> 4326.90]  it may not be the best paying
[4326.90 --> 4327.58]  but it's still pretty good
[4327.58 --> 4328.22]  he has a pretty cool job
[4328.22 --> 4329.70]  what's up

[4331.28 --> 4332.02]  alright
[4332.02 --> 4333.60]  so about a year ago
[4333.60 --> 4335.76]  you had a guest host on
[4335.76 --> 4336.08]  Dotto
[4336.08 --> 4337.52]  yeah Steve
[4337.52 --> 4337.96]  Dotto on data
[4337.96 --> 4338.42]  yeah yeah
[4338.42 --> 4339.84]  and I was wondering
[4339.84 --> 4341.18]  if there's anyone else like that
[4341.18 --> 4341.68]  that was like a huge
[4341.68 --> 4342.76]  source of inspiration
[4342.76 --> 4344.66]  you know what
[4344.66 --> 4345.58]  actually
[4345.58 --> 4346.98]  that's a great
[4346.98 --> 4347.98]  that's a great question
[4347.98 --> 4349.02]  because this Sunday
[4349.02 --> 4351.04]  I'm going down to chill
[4351.04 --> 4352.92]  with one of my main
[4352.92 --> 4354.18]  inspirations
[4354.18 --> 4355.22]  when I was starting up
[4355.22 --> 4355.86]  on YouTube
[4355.86 --> 4357.04]  Chris Perillo
[4357.04 --> 4358.42]  also known as
[4358.42 --> 4359.08]  Locker Gnome
[4359.08 --> 4360.42]  is going to be hosting
[4360.42 --> 4361.60]  an event called
[4361.60 --> 4362.44]  Vlogger Fair
[4362.44 --> 4364.58]  this weekend in Seattle
[4364.58 --> 4367.10]  so I will be on a panel
[4367.10 --> 4367.70]  down there
[4367.70 --> 4368.44]  on Sunday
[4368.44 --> 4369.26]  so I'll be doing
[4369.26 --> 4370.00]  two meetups
[4370.00 --> 4371.44]  within like three days
[4371.44 --> 4372.68]  which is kind of amazing
[4372.68 --> 4374.10]  so I'll be down there
[4374.10 --> 4375.08]  just on the Sunday
[4375.08 --> 4376.74]  and hanging out
[4376.74 --> 4377.42]  with Chris
[4377.42 --> 4378.50]  and he's going to be
[4378.50 --> 4378.94]  super busy
[4378.94 --> 4379.68]  so hopefully I get
[4379.68 --> 4380.38]  some of his time
[4380.38 --> 4381.54]  but there's going to be
[4381.54 --> 4382.24]  some other guys there
[4382.24 --> 4382.84]  I think Barnacles
[4382.84 --> 4383.80]  and Jay's Two Cents
[4383.80 --> 4384.48]  are showing up
[4384.48 --> 4385.36]  they're both
[4385.36 --> 4386.80]  based in that area
[4386.80 --> 4389.64]  yeah
[4389.64 --> 4390.58]  no Chris was a huge
[4390.58 --> 4391.26]  inspiration for me
[4391.26 --> 4392.32]  because he was like
[4392.32 --> 4393.90]  pardon my French
[4393.90 --> 4394.52]  he was like
[4394.52 --> 4395.16]  the shit
[4395.16 --> 4396.40]  when it came to tech
[4396.40 --> 4396.86]  on YouTube
[4396.86 --> 4398.00]  when I was first
[4398.00 --> 4398.62]  getting started
[4398.62 --> 4399.52]  no one
[4399.52 --> 4400.22]  no one could touch
[4400.22 --> 4400.76]  that guy
[4400.76 --> 4401.42]  and I didn't really
[4401.42 --> 4402.38]  follow the phone guys
[4402.38 --> 4403.40]  like your John Rettingers
[4403.40 --> 4404.46]  and your Soldier Knows Best
[4404.46 --> 4406.46]  and like I didn't really
[4406.46 --> 4407.22]  follow that stuff
[4407.22 --> 4408.44]  so when it came to like
[4408.44 --> 4409.54]  computer tech
[4409.54 --> 4410.48]  it was him
[4410.48 --> 4412.14]  so yeah
[4412.14 --> 4413.20]  I've learned a lot
[4413.20 --> 4414.04]  from Chris
[4414.04 --> 4414.68]  over the years
[4414.68 --> 4416.84]  we've hung out a few times
[4416.84 --> 4417.74]  whether it's at an airport
[4417.74 --> 4418.54]  on our way back
[4418.54 --> 4420.16]  from that AMD Hawaii event
[4420.16 --> 4420.90]  or whatever else
[4420.90 --> 4421.92]  and yeah
[4421.92 --> 4422.82]  he's a huge inspiration
[4422.82 --> 4423.36]  for me
[4423.36 --> 4423.94]  hi
[4423.94 --> 4425.82]  do you see Linus Media Group
[4425.82 --> 4426.54]  opening up more
[4426.54 --> 4427.18]  YouTube channels
[4427.18 --> 4427.68]  in the future
[4427.68 --> 4428.24]  yes
[4428.24 --> 4428.90]  let's play
[4428.90 --> 4430.46]  no let's plays
[4430.46 --> 4430.88]  probably
[4430.88 --> 4431.64]  I think it's a very
[4431.64 --> 4432.50]  crowded space
[4432.50 --> 4433.92]  I think there's a lot
[4433.92 --> 4434.52]  of let's players
[4434.52 --> 4434.88]  out there
[4434.88 --> 4435.72]  that do a great job
[4435.72 --> 4436.18]  thank you
[4436.18 --> 4438.90]  but
[4438.90 --> 4440.32]  and if anything
[4440.32 --> 4441.32]  I think
[4441.32 --> 4442.44]  I would be surprised
[4442.44 --> 4443.42]  if it's tech related
[4443.42 --> 4444.96]  I think between
[4444.96 --> 4445.88]  Linus Tech Tips
[4445.88 --> 4447.08]  and Tech Quickie
[4447.08 --> 4448.36]  we can handle
[4448.36 --> 4449.18]  you know
[4449.18 --> 4449.70]  your shows
[4449.70 --> 4450.42]  and your reviews
[4450.42 --> 4452.00]  and we can handle
[4452.00 --> 4453.58]  your rapid fire information
[4453.58 --> 4454.86]  basically like
[4454.86 --> 4456.26]  repository of
[4456.26 --> 4457.30]  facts about crap
[4457.30 --> 4458.18]  to do with tech
[4458.18 --> 4459.68]  and I think
[4459.68 --> 4460.64]  Channel Super Fun
[4460.64 --> 4461.88]  has been
[4461.88 --> 4462.32]  A
[4462.32 --> 4464.26]  really amazing
[4464.26 --> 4465.20]  in terms of the growth
[4465.20 --> 4466.08]  that we've experienced
[4466.08 --> 4466.76]  and B
[4466.76 --> 4469.44]  really fun
[4469.44 --> 4470.44]  for us to make
[4470.44 --> 4471.88]  and so I think
[4471.88 --> 4473.02]  our next project
[4473.02 --> 4474.04]  which may be sooner
[4474.04 --> 4474.86]  rather than later
[4474.86 --> 4475.84]  because
[4475.84 --> 4477.02]  Channel Super Fun
[4477.02 --> 4478.50]  is as big now
[4478.50 --> 4480.40]  as Tech Quickie was
[4480.40 --> 4481.04]  when we started
[4481.04 --> 4481.60]  Super Fun
[4481.60 --> 4482.66]  so
[4482.66 --> 4483.60]  it may be sooner
[4483.60 --> 4484.32]  rather than later
[4484.32 --> 4484.94]  but I think
[4484.94 --> 4485.94]  I'd be surprised
[4485.94 --> 4486.86]  if it's tech related
[4486.86 --> 4487.32]  at all
[4487.32 --> 4488.78]  maybe sketch comedy
[4488.78 --> 4489.94]  I think we've got
[4489.94 --> 4490.68]  a lot of really great
[4490.68 --> 4491.54]  characters here
[4491.54 --> 4492.62]  you know
[4492.62 --> 4493.30]  maybe something to do
[4493.30 --> 4493.78]  with toys
[4493.78 --> 4494.34]  which is what
[4494.34 --> 4495.00]  Channel Super Fun
[4495.00 --> 4495.94]  was supposed to be
[4495.94 --> 4496.94]  and completely
[4496.94 --> 4497.64]  ended up
[4497.64 --> 4498.92]  not becoming at all
[4498.92 --> 4502.08]  is anyone else
[4502.08 --> 4502.80]  coming in for
[4502.80 --> 4503.48]  live Twitter Blitz
[4503.48 --> 4505.88]  okay Luke
[4505.88 --> 4506.82]  come on back
[4506.82 --> 4507.36]  onto the show
[4507.36 --> 4508.68]  what's your favorite color
[4508.68 --> 4513.04]  mine's red
[4513.04 --> 4514.18]  you don't even
[4514.18 --> 4514.96]  you made that up
[4514.96 --> 4515.82]  on the spot
[4515.82 --> 4518.40]  okay this is
[4518.40 --> 4519.52]  a little known fact
[4519.52 --> 4520.68]  because I'm always
[4520.68 --> 4521.70]  on about pink
[4521.70 --> 4522.80]  my favorite color
[4522.80 --> 4523.94]  is actually green
[4523.94 --> 4526.12]  so there you go
[4526.12 --> 4528.54]  should we do
[4528.54 --> 4529.42]  oh we gotta do
[4529.42 --> 4530.12]  the Ashley Madison
[4530.12 --> 4530.54]  topic
[4530.54 --> 4532.20]  so more details
[4532.20 --> 4534.28]  on the Ashley Madison
[4534.28 --> 4534.88]  hack
[4534.88 --> 4536.16]  so those of you
[4536.16 --> 4537.16]  who aren't familiar
[4537.16 --> 4538.62]  ashleymadison.com
[4538.62 --> 4540.36]  is like a cheating
[4540.36 --> 4541.54]  site for married
[4541.54 --> 4541.98]  people
[4541.98 --> 4543.36]  and they
[4543.36 --> 4545.32]  they were threatened
[4545.32 --> 4546.22]  they said
[4546.22 --> 4547.00]  look we hacked
[4547.00 --> 4547.46]  into you
[4547.46 --> 4548.18]  we got all your
[4548.18 --> 4548.72]  user data
[4548.72 --> 4549.56]  including credit card
[4549.56 --> 4549.92]  information
[4549.92 --> 4550.50]  I hacked into you
[4550.50 --> 4551.24]  and they were
[4551.24 --> 4552.40]  you can hack into me
[4552.40 --> 4552.86]  anytime
[4552.86 --> 4553.92]  although I'd prefer
[4553.92 --> 4554.78]  if you didn't hack
[4554.78 --> 4555.88]  gentle this time
[4555.88 --> 4556.04]  please
[4556.04 --> 4556.50]  yes okay
[4556.50 --> 4558.42]  we learned the first
[4558.42 --> 4559.06]  time around
[4559.06 --> 4559.90]  that's not how you do
[4559.90 --> 4560.18]  that
[4560.18 --> 4561.54]  you gotta work
[4561.54 --> 4562.24]  into it
[4562.24 --> 4564.32]  so the hack is not
[4564.32 --> 4564.98]  only real
[4564.98 --> 4566.28]  it's worse than we
[4566.28 --> 4566.68]  thought
[4566.68 --> 4568.24]  the details are
[4568.24 --> 4568.72]  everywhere
[4568.72 --> 4570.40]  they basically said
[4570.40 --> 4571.30]  look if you don't
[4571.30 --> 4572.18]  pull down your site
[4572.18 --> 4573.36]  we're gonna leak all
[4573.36 --> 4573.78]  the data
[4573.78 --> 4575.30]  which included credit
[4575.30 --> 4575.86]  card information
[4575.86 --> 4576.76]  now to be clear
[4576.76 --> 4577.94]  if you want to check
[4577.94 --> 4578.64]  on your significant
[4578.64 --> 4579.50]  other or whatever
[4579.50 --> 4580.56]  the fact that they
[4580.56 --> 4581.22]  have an account
[4581.22 --> 4582.30]  is actually not
[4582.30 --> 4582.68]  meaningful
[4582.68 --> 4584.14]  I have an Ashley
[4584.14 --> 4584.88]  Madison account
[4584.88 --> 4585.92]  as soon as we
[4585.92 --> 4586.70]  started reporting
[4586.70 --> 4587.26]  on the Ashley
[4587.26 --> 4587.90]  Madison thing
[4587.90 --> 4589.06]  someone signed
[4589.06 --> 4590.22]  my email address
[4590.22 --> 4591.98]  up for an Ashley
[4591.98 --> 4592.76]  Madison account
[4592.76 --> 4593.76]  I've heard I have
[4593.76 --> 4595.10]  one but I haven't
[4595.10 --> 4595.62]  seen the thing
[4595.62 --> 4596.26]  I started getting
[4596.26 --> 4596.84]  newsletters
[4596.84 --> 4597.76]  I was like
[4597.76 --> 4599.30]  do people not do
[4599.30 --> 4600.16]  email verification
[4600.16 --> 4601.68]  apparently not
[4601.68 --> 4603.34]  so that's a cool
[4603.34 --> 4604.00]  thing because it
[4604.00 --> 4604.58]  means that there
[4604.58 --> 4605.48]  aren't necessarily
[4605.48 --> 4606.46]  30 million cheats
[4606.46 --> 4606.92]  out there
[4606.92 --> 4608.42]  because anyone
[4608.42 --> 4609.46]  even someone who
[4609.46 --> 4610.10]  has no idea
[4610.10 --> 4610.76]  they have an account
[4610.76 --> 4611.16]  can apparently
[4611.16 --> 4611.68]  have an account
[4611.68 --> 4613.82]  but they also
[4613.82 --> 4614.36]  leaked credit
[4614.36 --> 4615.04]  card information
[4615.04 --> 4616.02]  so if you want
[4616.02 --> 4616.74]  to actually use
[4616.74 --> 4617.22]  the site
[4617.22 --> 4618.14]  you need a credit
[4618.14 --> 4618.50]  card
[4618.50 --> 4619.64]  so if your credit
[4619.64 --> 4620.34]  card number's in
[4620.34 --> 4621.72]  there you used
[4621.72 --> 4622.30]  the site
[4622.30 --> 4623.04]  yes so it's
[4623.04 --> 4624.14]  taking a lot longer
[4624.14 --> 4624.96]  than we originally
[4624.96 --> 4625.94]  expected to find
[4625.94 --> 4626.42]  all the people
[4626.42 --> 4627.46]  that were actually
[4627.46 --> 4629.50]  using the website
[4629.50 --> 4630.56]  but it is starting
[4630.56 --> 4631.04]  to happen
[4631.04 --> 4632.08]  like basically
[4632.08 --> 4633.08]  person by person
[4633.08 --> 4633.88]  it's being leaked
[4633.88 --> 4636.00]  like the first
[4636.00 --> 4636.84]  tip-off was when
[4636.84 --> 4638.22]  like bobama
[4638.22 --> 4639.62]  at whatever.gov
[4639.62 --> 4640.46]  was registered
[4640.46 --> 4640.90]  and I was like
[4640.90 --> 4642.42]  that's not a thing
[4642.42 --> 4642.82]  no
[4642.82 --> 4643.44]  at all
[4643.44 --> 4643.94]  no
[4643.94 --> 4644.76]  that's like
[4644.76 --> 4645.38]  there was a lot
[4645.38 --> 4645.80]  of that
[4645.80 --> 4646.76]  so yeah
[4646.76 --> 4647.50]  he's in there
[4647.50 --> 4648.48]  for the same reason
[4648.48 --> 4649.80]  that my personal
[4649.80 --> 4650.72]  hotmail account
[4650.72 --> 4652.82]  which was leaked
[4652.82 --> 4654.04]  like three years ago
[4654.04 --> 4655.00]  and I never touch
[4655.00 --> 4655.74]  except for certain
[4655.74 --> 4656.20]  things
[4656.20 --> 4658.10]  like my Ashley
[4658.10 --> 4658.66]  Madison account
[4658.66 --> 4662.64]  so that account
[4662.64 --> 4663.86]  I logged into it
[4663.86 --> 4664.34]  at some point
[4664.34 --> 4664.92]  and realized
[4664.92 --> 4666.40]  I had I think
[4666.40 --> 4666.80]  it was either
[4666.80 --> 4667.76]  30 or 60
[4667.76 --> 4668.24]  it was some
[4668.24 --> 4669.06]  multiple of three
[4669.06 --> 4670.42]  thousand
[4670.42 --> 4672.28]  like daily
[4672.28 --> 4673.02]  bible verse
[4673.02 --> 4673.78]  newsletters
[4673.78 --> 4675.28]  sitting in it
[4675.28 --> 4676.62]  and I was like
[4676.62 --> 4677.86]  you gotta be
[4677.86 --> 4678.54]  kidding me
[4678.54 --> 4680.00]  so someone
[4680.00 --> 4680.92]  I think there are
[4680.92 --> 4681.16]  sites
[4681.16 --> 4681.32]  how long have you
[4681.32 --> 4681.82]  had that email
[4681.82 --> 4682.16]  account?
[4682.66 --> 4683.40]  oh I've had that
[4683.40 --> 4684.34]  email since like
[4684.34 --> 4684.74]  high school
[4684.74 --> 4685.74]  60,000 daily emails
[4685.74 --> 4686.08]  yeah
[4686.08 --> 4686.96]  no not daily
[4686.96 --> 4688.20]  but 60,000 emails
[4688.20 --> 4688.88]  from the ones
[4688.88 --> 4689.54]  coming in daily
[4689.54 --> 4690.10]  yeah yeah
[4690.10 --> 4690.34]  total
[4690.34 --> 4691.72]  and hotmail's
[4691.72 --> 4692.08]  filter
[4692.08 --> 4693.58]  can only
[4693.58 --> 4695.54]  like do so many
[4695.54 --> 4696.20]  at a time
[4696.20 --> 4697.20]  so when I'd
[4697.20 --> 4698.10]  search for keywords
[4698.10 --> 4698.80]  and it's not as
[4698.80 --> 4699.62]  good as Gmail's
[4699.62 --> 4699.92]  filter
[4699.92 --> 4701.60]  like it's not as
[4701.60 --> 4702.46]  granular in terms
[4702.46 --> 4703.04]  of what you can
[4703.04 --> 4703.38]  block
[4703.38 --> 4704.16]  so I could only
[4704.16 --> 4705.14]  block by like
[4705.14 --> 4706.16]  specific email
[4706.16 --> 4706.56]  address
[4706.56 --> 4707.64]  so if it's like
[4707.64 --> 4708.72]  info at
[4708.72 --> 4709.50]  lighthouse media
[4709.50 --> 4710.42]  that's different
[4710.42 --> 4711.62]  from news at
[4711.62 --> 4712.42]  lighthouse media
[4712.42 --> 4713.34]  which is different
[4713.34 --> 4714.24]  from admin at
[4714.24 --> 4714.98]  lighthouse media
[4714.98 --> 4716.34]  and then it takes
[4716.34 --> 4717.24]  like 10 minutes
[4717.24 --> 4718.08]  to go through
[4718.08 --> 4718.84]  all you know
[4718.84 --> 4719.70]  thousand of them
[4719.70 --> 4720.34]  because it can only
[4720.34 --> 4721.02]  do a page at a
[4721.02 --> 4721.42]  time
[4721.42 --> 4723.10]  like no
[4723.10 --> 4724.08]  I just want to
[4724.08 --> 4724.46]  get rid of them
[4724.46 --> 4724.70]  all
[4724.70 --> 4725.62]  it's like
[4725.62 --> 4727.16]  there couldn't
[4727.16 --> 4727.82]  be like
[4727.82 --> 4729.48]  why did you even
[4729.48 --> 4729.96]  need to use that
[4729.96 --> 4730.24]  email
[4730.24 --> 4731.94]  oh I use it as
[4731.94 --> 4732.76]  like my password
[4732.76 --> 4733.66]  recovery for certain
[4733.66 --> 4733.94]  things
[4733.94 --> 4735.80]  because actually
[4735.80 --> 4736.88]  did a dig through
[4736.88 --> 4737.66]  and find something
[4737.66 --> 4738.48]  hotmail has
[4738.48 --> 4739.22]  pretty sick
[4739.22 --> 4740.50]  two-step
[4740.50 --> 4741.14]  yeah
[4741.14 --> 4743.22]  so my hotmail
[4743.22 --> 4743.68]  account
[4743.68 --> 4744.24]  this is an
[4744.24 --> 4744.82]  interesting behind
[4744.82 --> 4745.44]  the scenes story
[4745.44 --> 4746.86]  my hotmail account
[4746.86 --> 4748.80]  was what saved
[4748.80 --> 4750.60]  my all of my
[4750.60 --> 4751.76]  other accounts
[4751.76 --> 4753.24]  when my youtube
[4753.24 --> 4753.98]  channel got
[4753.98 --> 4754.78]  hijacked a few
[4754.78 --> 4755.24]  years ago
[4755.24 --> 4757.42]  so they didn't
[4757.42 --> 4758.96]  get my hotmail
[4758.96 --> 4759.38]  account
[4759.38 --> 4760.60]  and that
[4760.60 --> 4761.82]  the notifications
[4761.82 --> 4762.72]  that I was getting
[4762.72 --> 4763.42]  as they were
[4763.42 --> 4764.34]  trying to get in
[4764.34 --> 4765.84]  was what alerted
[4765.84 --> 4767.26]  me to the need
[4767.26 --> 4768.12]  to change all my
[4768.12 --> 4768.78]  other passwords
[4768.78 --> 4770.42]  so they went for
[4770.42 --> 4771.26]  the hotmail account
[4771.26 --> 4772.36]  early and got
[4772.36 --> 4772.86]  locked out of
[4772.86 --> 4773.48]  everything else
[4773.48 --> 4775.30]  so that's why I
[4775.30 --> 4776.12]  like my hotmail
[4776.12 --> 4776.46]  account
[4776.46 --> 4776.86]  yeah
[4776.86 --> 4778.06]  also there's a
[4778.06 --> 4778.62]  few like
[4778.62 --> 4779.72]  people who only
[4779.72 --> 4780.20]  know how to reach
[4780.20 --> 4780.46]  me there
[4780.46 --> 4780.92]  I've had it for
[4780.92 --> 4781.70]  like 15 years
[4781.70 --> 4782.58]  so it's one of
[4782.58 --> 4783.04]  those things
[4783.04 --> 4783.98]  and that's a tip
[4783.98 --> 4784.82]  is to link your
[4784.82 --> 4785.68]  emails to a certain
[4785.68 --> 4786.04]  degree
[4786.04 --> 4786.56]  yep
[4786.56 --> 4787.12]  it's actually a
[4787.12 --> 4787.72]  really good idea
[4787.72 --> 4789.86]  so basically
[4789.86 --> 4790.86]  there's 10 gigs
[4790.86 --> 4791.68]  of Ashley Madison
[4791.68 --> 4792.58]  info out there
[4792.58 --> 4793.42]  it's pretty easy
[4793.42 --> 4793.96]  to find
[4793.96 --> 4795.54]  and they dumped
[4795.54 --> 4796.50]  another 20 gigs
[4796.50 --> 4797.40]  onto the dark web
[4797.40 --> 4798.14]  in addition to the
[4798.14 --> 4798.90]  earlier 10 gigs
[4798.90 --> 4800.10]  for a total of 30
[4800.10 --> 4802.20]  yeah
[4802.20 --> 4803.12]  so
[4803.12 --> 4803.60]  one of my
[4803.60 --> 4804.40]  favorite statistics
[4804.40 --> 4806.40]  there's thousands
[4806.40 --> 4807.38]  of fake female
[4807.38 --> 4807.82]  profiles
[4807.82 --> 4808.58]  and about 90
[4808.58 --> 4809.56]  to 95%
[4809.56 --> 4810.38]  of the actual
[4810.38 --> 4811.46]  users are male
[4811.46 --> 4812.58]  yeah
[4812.58 --> 4813.90]  we suck
[4813.90 --> 4814.70]  yeah
[4814.70 --> 4815.54]  wow
[4815.54 --> 4816.92]  we're bad
[4816.92 --> 4817.58]  at things
[4817.58 --> 4818.26]  yeah
[4818.26 --> 4818.80]  and we should
[4818.80 --> 4819.42]  probably feel
[4819.42 --> 4820.14]  bad for being
[4820.14 --> 4820.90]  bad at things
[4820.90 --> 4821.46]  yep
[4821.46 --> 4823.70]  all right
[4823.70 --> 4824.52]  so what else
[4824.52 --> 4825.60]  did we tease
[4825.60 --> 4826.40]  because I think
[4826.40 --> 4826.84]  we're already
[4826.84 --> 4827.16]  it's already
[4827.16 --> 4828.12]  almost 630
[4828.12 --> 4829.24]  popcorn time
[4829.24 --> 4830.28]  getting attacked
[4830.28 --> 4831.10]  yes
[4831.10 --> 4831.96]  so if
[4831.96 --> 4832.82]  you use
[4832.82 --> 4833.92]  popcorn time
[4833.92 --> 4836.04]  and you
[4836.04 --> 4837.40]  wanted another
[4837.40 --> 4838.20]  reason why
[4838.20 --> 4838.98]  you probably
[4838.98 --> 4840.04]  shouldn't
[4840.04 --> 4841.02]  movie studio
[4841.02 --> 4841.62]  sues
[4841.62 --> 4842.84]  individual
[4842.84 --> 4843.82]  popcorn time
[4843.82 --> 4844.42]  users for
[4844.42 --> 4844.90]  infringement
[4844.90 --> 4845.92]  so for those
[4845.92 --> 4846.24]  of you who
[4846.24 --> 4846.70]  aren't familiar
[4846.70 --> 4847.28]  with popcorn
[4847.28 --> 4847.62]  time
[4847.62 --> 4848.36]  I've tried it
[4848.36 --> 4849.56]  it's really
[4849.56 --> 4850.58]  really good
[4850.58 --> 4852.08]  like it's
[4852.08 --> 4852.24]  it's the
[4852.24 --> 4852.60]  Netflix
[4852.60 --> 4853.58]  of piracy
[4853.58 --> 4854.78]  you basically
[4854.78 --> 4855.68]  just stream
[4855.68 --> 4856.42]  from torrents
[4856.42 --> 4856.70]  and I was
[4856.70 --> 4858.18]  like wow
[4858.18 --> 4859.46]  this works
[4859.46 --> 4860.32]  really really
[4860.32 --> 4860.80]  well
[4860.80 --> 4862.78]  subtitles are
[4862.78 --> 4863.82]  all like a
[4863.82 --> 4864.64]  drop down
[4864.64 --> 4865.48]  I was like
[4865.48 --> 4866.92]  all that crap
[4866.92 --> 4868.06]  that like when
[4868.06 --> 4868.74]  you're watching a
[4868.74 --> 4869.20]  blu-ray
[4869.20 --> 4870.46]  like it blows me
[4870.46 --> 4871.76]  away how crappy
[4871.76 --> 4872.72]  the blu-ray
[4872.72 --> 4874.30]  experience still
[4874.30 --> 4874.86]  is
[4874.86 --> 4876.08]  why can't they
[4876.08 --> 4876.82]  fix this
[4876.82 --> 4877.64]  why do I
[4877.64 --> 4878.08]  have to sit
[4878.08 --> 4878.66]  through two
[4878.66 --> 4879.06]  minutes
[4879.06 --> 4879.88]  so blah blah
[4879.88 --> 4880.40]  blah don't
[4880.40 --> 4881.16]  copy this
[4881.16 --> 4882.32]  why do I
[4882.32 --> 4882.88]  have to go
[4882.88 --> 4883.58]  back to the
[4883.58 --> 4884.32]  menu every
[4884.32 --> 4884.98]  time why do
[4884.98 --> 4885.44]  I have to
[4885.44 --> 4886.82]  all these
[4886.82 --> 4887.86]  things just
[4887.86 --> 4888.96]  shut
[4888.96 --> 4890.68]  it's like it's
[4890.68 --> 4891.16]  very very
[4891.16 --> 4891.76]  annoying when
[4891.76 --> 4892.48]  the experience is
[4892.48 --> 4893.24]  worse for people
[4893.24 --> 4893.78]  that are paying
[4893.78 --> 4894.26]  for it
[4894.26 --> 4895.34]  okay here's a
[4895.34 --> 4895.92]  million dollar
[4895.92 --> 4896.58]  idea for the
[4896.58 --> 4897.20]  movie studios
[4897.20 --> 4898.08]  why do I have
[4898.08 --> 4898.48]  to come up
[4898.48 --> 4899.24]  with this crap
[4899.24 --> 4900.40]  the first
[4900.40 --> 4901.20]  blu-ray
[4901.20 --> 4902.70]  okay in the
[4902.70 --> 4903.28]  however many
[4903.28 --> 4904.04]  discs set
[4904.04 --> 4904.84]  should have
[4904.84 --> 4905.84]  fewer episodes
[4905.84 --> 4906.80]  of the show
[4906.80 --> 4907.28]  on it
[4907.28 --> 4908.10]  and it should
[4908.10 --> 4908.84]  have a lower
[4908.84 --> 4909.84]  quality compressed
[4909.84 --> 4910.98]  version of the
[4910.98 --> 4911.94]  entire season
[4911.94 --> 4912.92]  so I don't have
[4912.92 --> 4913.58]  to change my
[4913.58 --> 4914.42]  freaking blu-ray
[4914.42 --> 4915.58]  disc when I want
[4915.58 --> 4915.92]  to watch a
[4915.92 --> 4916.66]  different episode
[4916.66 --> 4917.30]  because I don't
[4917.30 --> 4918.02]  give a crap
[4918.02 --> 4918.72]  I'm watching
[4918.72 --> 4919.68]  family guy
[4919.68 --> 4920.88]  do I need more
[4920.88 --> 4921.34]  pixels
[4921.34 --> 4922.10]  no
[4922.10 --> 4924.28]  million dollar
[4924.28 --> 4924.78]  idea
[4924.78 --> 4925.66]  why do I have
[4925.66 --> 4926.08]  to come up
[4926.08 --> 4926.42]  with it
[4926.42 --> 4927.00]  peaking
[4927.00 --> 4928.24]  sorry sorry
[4928.24 --> 4928.94]  sorry headphone
[4928.94 --> 4929.34]  users
[4929.34 --> 4930.12]  all the peaking
[4930.12 --> 4932.02]  so it just
[4932.02 --> 4932.98]  it blows me away
[4932.98 --> 4933.66]  how much better
[4933.66 --> 4934.28]  the piracy
[4934.28 --> 4934.98]  experience is
[4934.98 --> 4936.34]  but the thing
[4936.34 --> 4936.72]  that people
[4936.72 --> 4937.10]  need to
[4937.10 --> 4937.64]  understand
[4937.64 --> 4938.32]  about popcorn
[4938.32 --> 4938.78]  time
[4938.78 --> 4939.84]  is even
[4939.84 --> 4940.58]  if you're
[4940.58 --> 4941.06]  a shameless
[4941.06 --> 4941.56]  pirate
[4941.56 --> 4942.56]  you should
[4942.56 --> 4943.94]  not use
[4943.94 --> 4944.26]  it
[4944.26 --> 4945.48]  because you
[4945.48 --> 4946.14]  don't know
[4946.14 --> 4946.68]  what you're
[4946.68 --> 4947.24]  seeding
[4947.24 --> 4948.46]  anything you
[4948.46 --> 4948.96]  watch
[4948.96 --> 4949.78]  sits and
[4949.78 --> 4950.38]  seeds in the
[4950.38 --> 4950.96]  background
[4950.96 --> 4952.38]  until you reboot
[4952.38 --> 4953.02]  your computer
[4953.02 --> 4953.70]  at least that's
[4953.70 --> 4954.24]  how it used to
[4954.24 --> 4954.38]  work
[4954.38 --> 4955.02]  I actually
[4955.02 --> 4955.50]  haven't looked
[4955.50 --> 4955.86]  into it
[4955.86 --> 4956.44]  since the original
[4956.44 --> 4957.82]  probably still
[4957.82 --> 4958.44]  how it works
[4958.44 --> 4959.54]  so popcorn
[4959.54 --> 4960.38]  time users
[4960.38 --> 4961.54]  you could be
[4961.54 --> 4962.02]  getting it
[4962.02 --> 4962.94]  pretty good
[4962.94 --> 4964.10]  if you use
[4964.10 --> 4964.72]  popcorn time
[4964.72 --> 4965.14]  a lot
[4965.14 --> 4965.92]  restart your
[4965.92 --> 4966.50]  computer very
[4966.50 --> 4966.94]  infrequently
[4966.94 --> 4967.86]  because it
[4967.86 --> 4968.28]  could mean
[4968.28 --> 4968.96]  a lot of
[4968.96 --> 4969.60]  different studios
[4969.60 --> 4970.62]  Netflix and chill
[4970.62 --> 4971.20]  what are you
[4971.20 --> 4971.58]  doing
[4971.58 --> 4972.04]  I'm talking
[4972.04 --> 4972.60]  twitch chat
[4972.60 --> 4974.04]  a lot of
