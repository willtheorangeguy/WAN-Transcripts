[0.00 → 8.80] hello okay welcome to the wan show guys we are a little late we're no we're right do they even
[8.80 → 13.10] I was talking in the twitch chat we're right we're right we are now a top shelf one do they even
[13.10 → 19.60] want to hear why at this point is it just is it are they just tired of my excuses i
[19.60 → 23.66] don't think we should bother anymore because like is it actually really any different how about just
[23.66 → 30.32] a short summary sure we don't touch the computer from week to week and yet it doesn't work when
[30.32 → 37.24] we sit back down in front of it capture cards are a giant steaming pile of garbage basically all of
[37.24 → 43.24] them as far as I can tell and uh what was the other what was the other bit this week uh well
[43.24 → 49.10] yeah uh we okay, okay I had to give back the SLR audio interface that I had borrowed for the last
[49.10 → 54.10] couple of weeks to find out if that would work with our external compressor and so I had to
[54.10 → 57.90] give that back so I had to reconfigure that but I knew that was coming that part was actually fine
[57.90 → 65.82] it was it the part that really bothers me is the part where I literally do not touch this entire
[65.82 → 72.24] corner of the building for a week and I come back, and it doesn't work the camera does get taken down
[72.24 → 78.46] every week yeah, but that's not the issue right, but you are unplugging things it's not like it was just
[78.46 → 85.32] running for the whole week I didn't, so there's that matter if you and actually the camera did
[85.32 → 90.06] not get unplugged this week it wasn't here what do you mean it wasn't here you said the camera wasn't
[90.06 → 94.14] you told me it wasn't set up what camera well no it was sitting here just like it didn't have a lens
[94.14 → 100.56] on it oh yeah, but a lens does not affect the connection between the SDI cable and the converter
[100.56 → 107.08] and the capture card like I don't understand i I feel like we need to just simplify things like uh I used
[107.08 → 112.02] to do a lot of Wii U streams using aver media cards which is like a video capture off of something
[112.02 → 118.78] yep and never had a single problem with any of those streams yep and yet here we are with aver media
[118.78 → 122.96] cards and other cards we're trying to use black magic ones we still have them in the computer which
[122.96 → 127.40] is probably causing yeah no I don't think that's causing the problem today sure that was
[127.40 → 131.52] definitely part of the issue that was definitely part of the issue but nothing to do with the fact
[131.52 → 138.10] that our live game reportable um all of a sudden needs a bunch of audio delays anyway so let's get
[138.10 → 144.26] right into what topics we have today we got one of them what we said one of them didn't we uh no we
[144.26 → 153.20] didn't even get to one of them no all right that's classic go for it Amazon drone service is uh there's
[153.20 → 157.18] no other notes other than that, so there's probably some information about the Amazon drone service more
[157.18 → 166.28] details also radon fury x2 is on the way something we kind of knew uh just cause 3 runs like garbage on
[166.28 → 172.58] the consoles which we probably could have guessed yeah even if we didn't already know and tech
[172.58 → 179.06] basically just I mean not because they not because they had any kind of choice in the matter but
[179.06 → 183.58] they admit that their tablet was recording personal data and that they were storing it
[183.58 → 188.68] and this was a toy tablet right yeah so without going super deep into the topic is it worse because
[188.68 → 194.84] it's for kids yes, yes it is way worse it is many many many times worse oh yeah they are minors I had
[194.84 → 199.12] to ask him because he's a parent I already had that opinion but his matters more I didn't think I was
[199.12 → 204.22] that obvious I think it's pretty obvious that it matters more if it's like no you called me a parent
[204.22 → 216.30] not even man
[216.30 → 225.98] uh
[225.98 → 228.54] yeah
[228.54 → 245.10] All right guys so uh oh everyone's uh everyone's all everyone's all upset about my
[245.10 → 251.26] fantastic dad jokes. I liked it. It was good. Especially because I was saying that I had to
[251.26 → 256.26] ask that because you were a dad. So the timing was good, and the quality was good. Haters going to hate
[256.26 → 263.62] yo. All right so this is about the least expected use of Jeremy Clarkson's talent. Yeah.
[263.62 → 269.62] That I could have possibly seen coming over uh over there at Amazon. But um yeah. Is it muted? Do you
[269.62 → 273.90] want it to be muted? Yeah, yeah yeah muted is fine. Yeah. Because basically they just have him explain
[273.90 → 279.78] that Junior here needs some cleats or something and then whatever. If only there were some way that
[279.78 → 285.16] Amazon could send it to you. I wonder how much Puma paid for this product placement. Yeah. Uh because
[285.16 → 290.18] he says the name of the specific cleat literally like it felt like six times in the video. So this
[290.18 → 296.62] is cool. So this is a VTOL drone which means vertical takeoff and landing. Actual flight footage
[296.62 → 301.52] not simulated, apparently. And then what it does is because you can see its kind of got a weird
[301.52 → 310.20] shape to it here. It actually converts to a forward flight craft. What is the crap? Just like that. So it
[310.20 → 315.52] has a range of I think they were figuring something to the tune of around 18 miles. It uses sensors to
[315.52 → 322.40] sense things. You know flight data like speed and what uh that that looks kind of simulated. And then
[322.40 → 328.16] basically it finds a suitable landing point. Delivery zone. And I think there's actually like a little
[328.16 → 333.48] like printout tag you put in your yard. Oh, okay. That it goes and finds. Then they actually
[333.48 → 341.62] show it's landing right on it. Now I was one of those people who was in the camp of this is pure
[341.62 → 349.62] this is pure uh April Fool's joke. They are messing around with us. Um I was of the mindset that they
[349.62 → 353.66] were just messing with us when they originally announced that they would deliver packages by
[353.66 → 361.28] drone. But it looks like they are actually serious about this. Uh they have done a fair bit of R&D
[361.28 → 366.52] presumably uh based on what they're saying in the video about you know how the drones have sensors
[366.52 → 371.44] to go around you know hot air balloons or whatever else. So they're working on it and they seem
[371.44 → 377.48] to be like for real about making this happen. Apparently it is designed to safely get packages
[377.48 → 384.60] to customers in 30 minutes or less. Making it actually faster for a small item. Um Mr. Clarkson
[384.60 → 389.42] works in a little joke about how the dog who chewed up the shoe is now getting a chew toy along
[389.42 → 395.98] with the new shoes. Um so as long as they are small lightweight items in under 30 minutes.
[395.98 → 402.40] There is no launch date. The drone in the video can fly for 15 miles. 15 miles. Sorry I said 18 miles
[402.40 → 408.66] I think. My bad. 15 miles. Um so that that means that not everyone's really going to be able to get
[408.66 → 413.76] this. And I wonder how widespread this is actually going to be considering the Amazon Fresh campaign.
[413.76 → 419.22] Is that still only in Seattle? Amazon Fresh? I know I thought they were in New York too?
[419.44 → 422.90] They might be. I'm not sure. I haven't looked this up. Furthermore, I was just thinking about that right now.
[423.32 → 428.04] Um Amazon seems to do things but then not necessarily spread them out actually all that well.
[428.16 → 434.16] Yeah Amazon Fresh subsidiary company in Seattle, Washington. It revived the business model of
[434.16 → 440.18] ordering groceries online. Bidibidi-bobbidi-bobbidi-bobbidi product lines. Uh selected parts of Centre City,
[440.18 → 445.54] Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New York City on October 17th 2014. So yeah it's uh San Francisco,
[445.54 → 449.70] San Diego. Still kind of taking some time to spread out. Yes. It's doing okay though. Yeah, we're
[449.70 → 455.54] we're obviously this is not something where it's like yes this is driving 18 percent of our annual
[455.54 → 461.38] revenue. Uh yeah nothing, nothing like that. But um and there's still problems just like there was
[461.38 → 466.34] last time when putting prime air into service will this is a quote putting primary into service will
[466.34 → 472.10] take some time, but we will deploy when we have the regulatory support needed to realize our vision.
[472.10 → 477.06] That's huge. Yeah, it's going to take a while and I mean this doesn't address a lot of the other issues
[477.06 → 483.38] as well. So the drones that the drone they showed off there apparently flies at about 400 feet. So for
[483.38 → 493.22] the um for the metric people it's about 130 meters uh which yeah it's not very high. No. Actually so if is
[493.22 → 498.18] the whole thing that people are joking about online, and you know if someone jokes about it on yeah
[498.18 → 503.78] The hunting the drones' thing? Yeah. If is a thousand people joke about it online. One person's going to do it.
[503.78 → 508.82] One will do it. Yeah. And that's kind of all it's going to take is for one person to shoot like a net gun
[508.82 → 515.62] at a drone, have it come down, peg some kid in the head, kill them and then. I was just going to say
[515.62 → 522.34] the first one that falls is going to be fascinating. Yep. Can Amazon just pay its way out of this?
[522.34 → 526.90] You know like here's six million dollars, sorry your kid's dead or whatever like
[528.66 → 533.54] I don't know. Will they keep the program going at that point? How important is it for people
[533.54 → 537.70] to get things in 30 minutes or less? Because there's currently about airplanes like really
[537.70 → 543.06] regulatory maintenance issues where they're they're repairing the planes out of the states because
[543.06 → 550.10] there's lower uh I don't know what the right word for it is uh you don't have to be as careful when
[550.10 → 555.14] you're doing maintenance when you do it outside the states so seriously airplane people like
[555.14 → 560.90] airlines are looser regulations that's what I was looking for. There are lower amounts of regulations
[560.90 → 564.02] looser regulations for repairing airplanes so they're doing it outside the states.
[564.90 → 569.22] Uh they're already sketchy about airplanes think about drones are they going to be doing maintenance
[569.22 → 576.82] checks on these things like every trip or every couple trips? I doubt it. Yeah. Unless Amazon has like
[576.82 → 584.42] robots that are going to do that, but then I don't know. It's a really cool idea. People are saying
[584.42 → 589.06] that the limit for drones is 400 feet and that's why. Yeah, but that's not really the point. The point
[589.06 → 596.10] is that people will be bringing them down. Yes. So yeah I mean if the US changes the regulations and
[596.10 → 601.78] allows Amazon to fly them higher than that's that opens up a whole other can of worms because...
[601.78 → 607.86] Someone in the chat said, so I guess we're all wondering if Amazon Prime Air is going to take off.
[607.86 → 621.38] Probably sounded horrible. Yeah. Sorry everyone. So there was one other comment that I wanted to make
[621.38 → 627.38] about it. Right yeah one of the first one of the top comments on the video was from someone
[627.38 → 632.90] saying like oh you know the couriers must be really worried about this to which I would
[632.90 → 639.38] reply I really don't think so. Amazon even now is positioning this and intelligently so is
[639.38 → 646.82] positioning this as a premium service. Yeah. So this is not like you need to have a market like
[646.82 → 652.26] if you saw in the video you need to have a little like drop the package here thing in your yard. I don't
[652.26 → 655.78] know how many people are gonna actually do that. Well no I think you just like print it when you
[655.78 → 661.70] place your order, and you check it there. Oh, yeah. I don't think it's... It looked like it was down in the grass. I don't think it's permanent.
[661.70 → 667.14] It looks I don't know in the video. Okay. Maybe they like did a heavy one so that it wouldn't like get
[667.14 → 672.10] blown away and stuff. I know it would probably look better. Yet another concern. It ends up in your
[672.10 → 678.98] neighbour's yard they're like nope my property now. What yeah what happens when it screws up a delivery?
[678.98 → 686.50] Yeah. So, so okay there are a lot of concerns okay. So A's expensive. B this is going to be for lightweight
[686.50 → 694.10] items only. Small orders only. I'm pretty sure they were doing cleats. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that UPS is not
[694.10 → 699.54] worried at this point about you know all the people ordering like half the'm just trying to think
[699.54 → 704.90] what percentage of the stuff we order off of Amazon would fit in a little drone like that? Us? Not much.
[704.90 → 709.22] Yeah not, not much. It's like if you order a computer case I don't think there's going to be the like the
[709.22 → 713.14] jumbo drone. With that said. I prefer the like books and stuff if you can carry cleats you might be able
[713.14 → 719.46] to carry a book or two. And Zeppelin technology is coming back. That's awesome. Zeppelins are coming
[719.46 → 726.42] back my friend so if they can get the Zeppelin drone going. As long as they don't make them out of. Have like a crane
[726.42 → 730.42] lower out of it and drop your package off. Like crane lowers out, and then it just like tilts up and just
[730.42 → 734.58] slides off. Yeah, I mean okay as long as they don't make the Zeppelins out of hydrogen or lead.
[735.06 → 737.86] Then we're in perfect shape. Yeah. There you go.
[739.62 → 743.94] All right. Let's just see if there's anything else to really say about it. Probably not.
[743.94 → 747.94] I don't know. We've talked about this thing like three times. Almost nothing's changed except there's a video.
[747.94 → 756.42] Well the smart. The video changes a lot for me because seeing such an elegant design for a VTOL plane.
[757.38 → 761.46] Oh the drone itself is super cool. Makes a big difference to me because when they originally did
[761.46 → 767.70] the April Fool's joke they were using a quadcopter drone or a six copter drone if I recall correctly.
[767.70 → 772.02] And that's like some of the stuff out of China. Yeah. Right where we've seen like you know early
[772.02 → 781.06] attempts to it's all like this six copter like just total like disaster over long distances designs.
[781.06 → 789.22] Whereas yeah if you can go all plane you know forward flying on it then it might actually work.
[789.22 → 795.78] Very, very cool. I want to know what prevents people from capturing them when they land in their yard.
[795.78 → 803.46] Like I'm sure they have sensors cameras whatever. Yeah, I'm I'm fairly sure that I could order something
[803.46 → 810.34] to anyone's address for one thing. I could put on a ski mask or whatever and like capture the drone
[810.34 → 816.58] when it lands put it in a lead box, and you know take it away to I don't know like I'm sure someone's
[816.58 → 821.78] if something is valuable someone will come up with a way to steal it. Yeah. Period.
[821.78 → 826.26] Someone will probably get one. Yeah. Or it'll land and drop off its thing and then
[828.74 → 831.30] not really be able to leave. Like I don't know something's going to happen.
[832.10 → 837.06] And I guess it's funny people are worried about like automation and rightfully so.
[837.06 → 842.18] But I mean that creates a new job right? The guy whose job it is to get in his car and drive to
[842.18 → 847.70] drive to the customer's house be like hey yeah sorry the drone's in the backyard can I just
[847.70 → 852.74] here's a here's a gift card I'm going to go get that. Thanks for that.
[855.54 → 862.02] So that was posted on the forum by Pixel Density. Thank you for that. Next article today posted by
[862.02 → 871.14] PC Beyond on the forum. YouTube seeks to compete with Netflix. Original article here is from arstechnica.co.uk.
[871.14 → 878.90] And I think YouTube's intentions of you know getting movie deals and TV show deals
[879.78 → 887.70] and wanting more professionally made premium content is not exactly new. But what is new is that
[887.70 → 892.34] there are some more details about them being perhaps a little bit more serious about it than last time
[892.34 → 898.58] around. So the Wall Street Journal reported that YouTube is looking to bolster YouTube red specifically
[898.58 → 903.46] with TV shows and movies because YouTube premium or whatever they called it before.
[903.46 → 907.46] You could rent movies on YouTube before. That's not new. And you've been able to watch like UFC fights.
[907.46 → 914.42] Yep. But so but that was pay-per-view and rentals. Yeah. Whereas this would be like basically a direct shot
[914.42 → 920.34] across the bow of Netflix by saying okay no we want to have a monthly subscription that also includes
[920.34 → 927.78] TV shows and movies. And if they pull this off I mean YouTube red effectively becomes your Spotify,
[928.58 → 936.02] your Netflix, and your ad-free YouTube. Like the ad-free YouTube for 10 bucks a month is already a
[936.02 → 939.78] compelling enough value that I'm probably going to do it. And then you get music, and might get
[939.78 → 944.66] movies as well. And you might get movies and then TV shows. And TV shows. And TV shows. I mean ad-free
[945.22 → 951.70] ad-free YouTube from a purely I need my kids to shut up for half an hour while I get a little bit more
[951.70 → 956.50] sleep in the morning is already enough for me to spend the $10 a month on it. Because let me tell you
[957.38 → 965.46] a one-year-old is super interested in you know A is for Apple, A, A, Apple. And then when some ad for like
[965.46 → 973.06] Bore skin cream comes on she starts mashing at it. She starts throwing it. She starts
[973.06 → 980.74] making noise. I'm like no I'm still sleeping. Please just A is for Apple .
[983.14 → 988.42] And snoozing in the morning when you get woken up every literally every three and a half minutes
[988.42 → 993.94] when the ad comes on. And you know it's amazing how much the way that YouTube has monetized kids
[993.94 → 999.78] content has changed in the last two years. Because when my son was one, and I wanted to sleep in the
[999.78 → 1005.78] morning like kids TV one two three had almost no ads on it. Like one out of every 30 videos that
[1005.78 → 1012.66] played was going to be monetized. Now it's like every single one. That's a huge percentage of YouTube
[1012.66 → 1019.94] at this point. Yep. Yeah, but I just I thought that the know kids advertising laws were
[1021.30 → 1029.06] a little complicated which isn't to yeah which then again I guess you know. TV does it too. Yeah, TV does it
[1029.06 → 1033.14] too. Yeah, but there's like rules depending on the country. Like in Canada this is interesting. I have
[1033.14 → 1039.54] no idea about any of this. Yeah, in Canada a commercial can't start with hey kids do you want to buy the
[1039.54 → 1048.10] new wild wacky amazing adventure pack. It has to be like hey parents do you want to buy for your kids
[1048.10 → 1054.50] the wild wacky amazing action pack. Look at how amazing this thing is. So it has it's the voice that
[1054.50 → 1059.54] that it's speaking. It has to address a different audience. But I guess that leads us that actually
[1059.54 → 1064.90] leads us pretty well into this post by Mule on the forum. The original article here is Kit Guru
[1064.90 → 1075.78] and Tech. Tech got nailed son. So if you you guys know Tech? Like I only really know them
[1075.78 → 1083.30] from like clear plastic cordless you know phones. Yeah yeah. Back when we had a landline. Yeah, a lot
[1083.30 → 1087.70] of people have those as landlines. At least here anyway like I'm pretty sure like future
[1087.70 → 1091.70] shop in the source. You walked in you wanted a cordless phone you walked out. And you wanted
[1091.70 → 1099.30] and you wanted a relatively cheap one. 900 megahertz. Yeah. 2.4 gigahertz. So remember how they wrote the
[1099.30 → 1109.30] V like there are tons of these. Yeah, so basically they admit their toy hack affected 6.4 million children.
[1109.30 → 1113.30] This is great. Their statement about it. So I'll give you a bit more details after. But
[1113.86 → 1120.10] regrettably our database was not as secure as it should have been.
[1124.98 → 1130.82] So in a nutshell on the 14th of November its Learning Lodge App Store was broken into
[1130.82 → 1137.14] giving a hacker access to the customer database and Kid Connect services. So what's the worst thing about
[1137.14 → 1147.70] this is that servers. Yeah. So this hack actually allowed them to get access not only to just like
[1147.70 → 1154.50] you know login and login and password. But they actually were able to figure out the exact
[1155.38 → 1160.42] the exact accounts that they were tied to giving them access to way more personal information than
[1160.42 → 1166.34] just that. And they had a bunch of other stuff in their data in their system including
[1166.34 → 1173.86] the hackers were able to access more than 190 gigs of photos and audio logs off of these devices that
[1173.86 → 1179.46] can then be traced back to usernames and account details which makes the security threat much more
[1179.46 → 1187.22] worrisome especially considering this is a child-friendly marketed device. The Input
[1187.22 → 1194.50] Max our fastest tablet featuring V-sex whoops. Oh, it doesn't have that on it. V-tech selected
[1194.50 → 1201.62] Android apps and games. That's really sketchy. I'm not a huge fan of it. It also
[1202.98 → 1208.02] compromised other sites as well. One of them I can't even really say. Lump Bow X Revs.
[1209.94 → 1214.90] I don't know probably said that super wrong. VSmileLink.com Sleepy Bear Lullaby Time
[1214.90 → 1220.42] which is the greatest name for a website ever. Yeah, I kind of want to buy that site. It reminds me of
[1220.42 → 1228.02] Channel Super Fun. Sleepy Bear Lullaby Time. Dot com. So great. Anyway. So these are all V-tech
[1228.66 → 1236.18] owned entities. Yeah. So I guess I don't know what is there to really say. By the way Reveal
[1236.18 → 1240.82] posted this on the forum. Thanks for that. What is there to really say other than you know lock up your
[1240.82 → 1245.70] lock up your kids and keep them away from all internet. It's hide you. Hide your what? It's hide
[1245.70 → 1251.14] your kids. Hide your kids. Not lock up your kids. No it's lock up your daughters. That's the. Oh. Yeah. I
[1251.14 → 1256.42] thought you were going for internet meme. No, no no, no no. Hide your kids. Hide your wife. Yeah. Because
[1256.42 → 1263.38] they're hacking everybody out here. Yeah, nothing. Nothing's safe hey. Not really. I think I own V-tech stuff.
[1264.18 → 1268.42] Nothing. Nothing that collects any personal information. It's like. I don't because the only thing I ever
[1268.42 → 1273.94] knew that they made were like relatively cheap phones. That's the only reason why I don't know.
[1273.94 → 1278.34] Yeah. No I'm pretty sure they make lots of kids stuff. Because I have like this. I have like this goofy.
[1279.14 → 1283.70] It's got like a keyboard on it. And it's got like just kind of games like fill in the letter blank.
[1283.70 → 1287.46] Okay. And there's like. Yeah, yeah yeah. There's like a happy bear that asks you to fill in the
[1287.46 → 1293.70] letter. Create a letter bridge. Not a sleepy bear? Yeah. No. Not a sleepy bear. I love that website name.
[1293.70 → 1301.14] Sleepy bear lullaby time. This is kind of a big deal. Posted by commission. I don't know how to
[1301.14 → 1308.98] pronounce that. But on the forum. So this is from geek.com. Sony unlocks the PlayStation 4's seventh
[1308.98 → 1315.14] processing core for developers. So in a nutshell this is something Microsoft already did a little
[1315.14 → 1322.66] while back. In order to get a little more competitive with the PlayStation 4 is the AMD
[1322.66 → 1327.62] custom processor that they're actually both using. Although different slightly, slightly different
[1327.62 → 1333.38] versions of it. But the actual CPU cores themselves. They're both using an eight core APU of sorts.
[1333.38 → 1340.10] And so the Bone was reserving two of its cores for things like Kine ct say for example.
[1340.10 → 1346.26] Yeah. So Microsoft kind of went oh shoot we're kind of losing the performance war. Because Microsoft
[1346.26 → 1351.46] went with a slightly slower tuned version. Yeah. So they unlocked a seventh core which means that
[1351.46 → 1359.38] in games that need to leverage that extra horsepower you can't access some background processes such as
[1359.38 → 1365.70] menus and Kine ct say are such as sorry excuse me men choose such as Kine ct. Which is good. Which is
[1365.70 → 1369.94] which is fine because if the game wasn't going to leverage Kine ct at all anyway. Yeah. Then it can
[1369.94 → 1375.62] use the processing power that would have been locked and unused. Yes. And with you know if you're
[1375.62 → 1380.82] making you know happy dance party time X or whatever game. Happy bear sleepy time. Yeah. Then you
[1380.82 → 1385.30] frankly don't need the seven cores anyway. So that that seems like a pretty good compromise to me. So
[1385.30 → 1392.50] place, so Sony has now I think we're yeah, so this was back in January that Microsoft did it. So almost a
[1392.50 → 1398.90] year later they have now done the same thing allowing the PlayStation 4 to basically get as close to its
[1398.90 → 1404.42] potential maximum as it can. Which is going to be brutal for Xbox One because they already did this
[1404.42 → 1412.34] and like still losing to PlayStation. So now PlayStation will be even more ahead. Yeah, with I guess the um
[1412.98 → 1418.90] the the the main this just the discussion point here because that news in and of itself is not
[1418.90 → 1423.78] actually terribly exciting. The consoles this generation are underpowered. Yeah. Whoop freaking do.
[1423.78 → 1428.58] Here's what I want to know, and I want to hear from you guys. We're going to straw pull this up in here.
[1428.58 → 1435.14] Nice. I'm excited. I like straw pulls. If you think back to Microsoft's Xbox One launch event.
[1435.78 → 1439.86] Their whole thing. The server thing. Is that what you're talking about? No I'm not going to talk about that.
[1439.86 → 1443.62] That's that's a whole other ball of wax. That still drives me insane. That might not that might just never
[1443.62 → 1449.78] see the light of day. I don't think so. Um so did we're going to use cloud servers to render things
[1449.78 → 1453.86] for your thing, and it's going to make it easier and better and faster and that'll never happen.
[1456.42 → 1461.46] All right uh hold on I'm just going to create I'm going to create the um. It's like skiing in World
[1461.46 → 1465.06] of Warcraft. How many times have they said they were going to put skiing in the game? Nope.
[1465.06 → 1471.22] Have they? Yeah. It was on the back of the box for Wrath of the Like King. Excellent.
[1471.94 → 1478.58] All right well at any rate there's the straw pull. Um. Random facts that don't matter. There you go.
[1478.58 → 1484.66] Did not know that. So if you think back to the guys I didn't even ask the question. I haven't
[1484.66 → 1490.74] clarified yet. Well keep the tab open so you can fix it in case you change your mind. So if you think
[1490.74 → 1498.34] back to the Xbox One launch event. Microsoft's whole spiel was that the Xbox One is not a game console.
[1498.34 → 1505.14] It is like your family living room hub. It is your entertainment hub. It is your
[1505.62 → 1510.42] you watch TV on it. You know wave at it, and you're like hey Xbox wow
[1511.30 → 1518.50] wake up and let's play some games. Oh, well not just games. Maybe we're gonna look at our photos or access
[1518.50 → 1523.06] our Skydive or yeah I guess they still called it Skydive at that point. I don't know. Anyway
[1523.06 → 1530.34] the point is it was supposed to be more than just a game console a game machine but not a PC. It
[1530.34 → 1533.70] wasn't a PC. Trying to make it an entertainment system. Yeah, they didn't know what the hell it was. So
[1533.70 → 1542.10] did they learn their lesson? Is that what we're figuring out here? Now that Microsoft and Sony
[1542.10 → 1548.98] have both kind of gone oh shit people don't really care other than like their Netflix app.
[1549.70 → 1554.82] They don't really care about doing anything on this other than playing video games. I don't think they
[1554.82 → 1561.24] have. It turns out a game console is just a console. Or are they going to come back with the Xbox 2 and the
[1561.24 → 1567.88] PlayStation 5 and are they going to be like if they call it the 2 I'm gonna I'm going to like crap a brick
[1567.88 → 1574.52] okay if they call it the Xbox 2. That would be so horrible. Um so are they going to come back with
[1574.52 → 1581.08] that and go yeah we added way more power this time for way better gaming, and also we cordoned off a bit
[1581.08 → 1586.68] of it again for like we're going to still try and do that other stuff again. So I want to know I want to
[1586.68 → 1589.96] know from you guys. So let's let's head over to my screen let's have a look at straw poll results.
[1589.96 → 1595.24] We've got a whopping 58% of you most of whom didn't even wait for me to explain the question
[1595.24 → 1602.36] saying no they did not learn their lesson. A 31% of you are voting for turnip the way you should
[1602.36 → 1607.80] throwing away your votes. I love the timing of our whole vote for turnip thing and then Donald Trump
[1607.80 → 1616.68] coming for president. Every time I wear that shirt. Every time I wear that shirt people are like ah it's a
[1616.68 → 1620.84] Donald Trump joke because you might as well just vote for a turnip and it kind of looks like it.
[1621.96 → 1632.44] Um and then 11% of you go yes they're going to treat a game console like a game console next time.
[1632.44 → 1635.96] I don't think so. What do you okay well I was about to ask what you think, but I guess
[1635.96 → 1640.20] way to interrupt me? Whoa. Why do you always interrupt me? You better let me talk this whole
[1640.20 → 1643.48] stream. I hate that you're interrupting. Multiple stories to stream I'm like
[1645.56 → 1651.96] okay. Anyway I don't think that they have uh reasons for why I don't think that they have are
[1651.96 → 1656.36] largely based in the past. I know things have changed but still um this was the first time that
[1656.36 → 1662.12] they've made money by selling their console. So I feel like. Not much. I know but still before they were
[1662.12 → 1665.56] losing now they're making some. It's actually a pretty significant difference when you're selling
[1665.56 → 1669.64] that much volume. So you're saying we're still going to get underpowered consoles because they got
[1669.64 → 1674.04] used to the idea of making money selling the console. Yes. I get it. Before it was like accessories
[1674.04 → 1679.16] and whatever, and we'll make it, and it'll be awesome. Now it's like experience, and we want to make more
[1679.16 → 1686.44] money because it's more premium or not really. And $160 accessories. Yeah. Yeah, that too. Elite controller.
[1686.44 → 1693.32] Yeah. Um so I don't really think so and this honestly should have been in there from the start
[1693.96 → 1703.16] even if it was um still aimed to not be as game of a game console as it is. Right. Um because why not?
[1703.16 → 1708.36] Yeah why force the developer. Yeah. So I don't think that actually has anything to do about them
[1708.36 → 1713.72] learning that it should be just a game console. I think that has them has more to do with that
[1713.72 → 1717.56] should have just been a thing. Why lock it off? That's just stupid. I will explain why.
[1717.56 → 1722.04] And actually you know what? Because they're trying to force people to use the thing? I was going to say
[1722.04 → 1727.00] no it's deeper than that. Okay. I was going to say that I was going to disagree with you. I was going to say
[1727.00 → 1732.68] that I think they learned their lesson and I think they're going to come back focused on gaming and gamers.
[1732.68 → 1738.52] Mm-hmm. But I actually realized as you were talking that I'm with you but for a slightly different
[1738.52 → 1745.96] reason. Okay. Because I think they are still going to try to force the game developers to use the gimmick
[1745.96 → 1753.24] and they're still going to try and create the gimmick because at the end of the day 900p versus 720p
[1753.96 → 1761.48] is something that the PC audience cares about but that the console audience is frankly many of them
[1761.48 → 1767.56] not that interested in. Whereas when you create a marketing video look at how many Wii's. It's still
[1767.56 → 1773.24] fun. Look at how many Wii's Nintendo sold from showing people waggling sticks around. Honestly
[1773.24 → 1778.36] though that was legitimately fun. It was. And the Kine ct isn't. But that's what the marketing that's
[1778.36 → 1782.44] that's the marketing engine. That's why they're going to keep forcing game they're going to come up with a
[1782.44 → 1787.16] gimmick. Yeah. Yeah. And they're going to force game devs to use the gimmick, and they're gonna they're gonna
[1787.16 → 1791.00] they're going to punish game devs who don't use the gimmick, and they're going to do it again and again and again
[1791.40 → 1799.96] because that's visually interesting whereas 300 fps at 4k well actually 4k they might be able to sell
[1799.96 → 1805.96] but but but not for a long time because 4k TVs are only now just barely approaching affordability.
[1805.96 → 1812.04] Okay first off I am a Nintendo fanboy, so I'm just going to get that like fairly across the board. We know.
[1812.60 → 1816.60] Even though they're despicable in so many ways. They're pretty bad, but it's okay it's okay it's
[1816.60 → 1821.56] fine. It's all that's coming out to me. Joshi's adorable. I have the woolly one the little toy
[1821.56 → 1827.56] because I bought Joshi's Woolly World which is just the best game. It's so much fun. If you complete
[1827.56 → 1833.40] a level with 100% you get another Joshi, and he comes and like you can get like a cow Joshi or like a forest
[1833.40 → 1840.44] Joshi, and they're hilarious, and they're super cute. Anyway moving forward with the Wii when they make some
[1840.44 → 1845.88] crazy gimmick thing you can just ignore it. The developer can just ignore it. With the game pad
[1845.88 → 1850.28] thing you don't have to use it. Unless the developer's Nintendo and they're making Twilight Princess.
[1850.28 → 1854.92] And then they're going to do some stupid crap. Yeah, sure. I had to buy a classic controller just to play
[1854.92 → 1861.56] that stupid game. Yes, yes. Carry on though. But they can. They don't force people to use their gimmicky
[1861.56 → 1865.88] things. Like you can just turn the controller sideways turning into more retro style controller.
[1865.88 → 1869.96] Use none of the motion stuff. The least ergonomic retro controller ever. It's pretty rough but still.
[1869.96 → 1875.40] Use none of the motion stuff and just play normal. With a condom on the end. You don't have to.
[1875.40 → 1882.84] You can take that off. You can go raw dog. Yeah, but that's not safe. That's true. Bareback is not the kind of
[1882.84 → 1889.16] Wii use that me. To be fair though that's the only way I use my controllers. Because you trust yourself
[1889.16 → 1896.04] not to throw them at your TV. I mean never. Okay this is. Okay, sorry. Do you still have your train
[1896.04 → 1901.80] of thought? Will you be able to come back to it? I think I'm good. Go for it. Okay. Okay so. I was
[1901.80 → 1907.96] sitting at work. Okay I was at my desk. I was working at NCI back when the Wii came out. So I was sitting
[1907.96 → 1913.32] at my desk and I had gotten the Wii for myself for Christmas for my family, but it was for me. Come
[1913.32 → 1921.96] on. So I'd gotten the Wii for myself for Christmas and I like my in-laws and my now wife then girlfriend
[1921.96 → 1927.00] and I had spent like the entire holiday season bowling and like playing tennis with each other.
[1927.00 → 1927.72] Yeah. Yeah. That's fun.
[1927.72 → 1933.88] And it was great. So I read I start reading the articles about people breaking their TVs,
[1933.88 → 1941.32] flinging Wii motes into them. And I'm at my in-laws house, and I'm talking to my now girl then
[1941.32 → 1950.28] girlfriend now wife. I don't now have a girlfriend. And I'm like what kind of flipping idiot throws a
[1950.28 → 1961.64] Wii mote at the TV. So she kind of goes ashen. Right? And like just like she kind of changes the subject.
[1961.64 → 1965.56] And I'm like meanwhile I want to talk about this forever. I'm like you have to be freaking kidding me.
[1966.20 → 1969.88] Like if you're that sweaty take a break. Okay?
[1971.32 → 1977.08] Stop flinging your arms around. Take a breather. Okay? The Wii even interrupts you every like 20 minutes or whatever.
[1977.08 → 1977.80] You should go outside.
[1977.80 → 1981.80] It's like yeah. Hey everyone just stop playing Wii sports for 10 minutes. Okay?
[1982.68 → 1989.24] So later on I'm talking to her, and she's like so yeah my dad like threw the Wii mote today.
[1989.24 → 1994.28] He was in the room when I'm talking about this. She's like yeah my dad threw the Wii mote at the TV today. He almost broke it.
[1995.08 → 2001.16] And I was just like what? That is so brutal. I thought you were talking about the like gel sleeve.
[2001.16 → 2006.04] No they didn't exist yet. Oh. This was in the early days. I'm like oh gee wee.
[2006.04 → 2009.24] Yeah no, no I know. Yeah. That was what I was talking about. Yeah.
[2009.24 → 2011.96] That was what I was talking about when I talked about the Wii condom but.
[2011.96 → 2015.00] I got one. I was super lucky. You remember how the stock was terrible?
[2015.00 → 2018.60] Yeah. You couldn't find them anywhere? I just. I camped out twice. Furthermore, I didn't camp out at all.
[2018.60 → 2025.00] I walked into my local Best Buy and like some employee that didn't know that they were back stocked or whatever just put one on the shelf.
[2025.00 → 2030.28] And I was like uh okay picked it up and bought it. The person at the till was like what?
[2031.08 → 2035.96] I was like yep cool. Just walked out and got one. I think it was probably someone else's order.
[2035.96 → 2039.96] So after I realized that I felt kind of bad. But I was like it's on the shelf.
[2039.96 → 2046.12] So I just bought it. Felt kind of bad all the way to the bank. Oh, well. It was kind of expensive at the time.
[2046.12 → 2051.56] Well yeah. What was it like $400? I don't remember. But I remember like I had saved up for it for a bit.
[2051.56 → 2055.40] And I think my mom like helped contribute because she wanted the fitness Devi pad thing.
[2055.40 → 2057.40] I ended up with four of them before Christmas.
[2058.60 → 2061.80] Yeah well my wife. My wife and I camped twice. Okay.
[2061.80 → 2067.96] And so my boss the owner of NCI needed one. So that got a hefty markup. Yeah.
[2069.16 → 2073.32] My other boss who was actually he actually visited our studio the other day.
[2073.32 → 2073.64] Yeah okay. Yeah.
[2073.64 → 2077.32] He's like I would consider him a friend not just like a former boss.
[2079.16 → 2084.76] So my other boss got one. He got a less hefty, but definitely you know yeah well they're going for
[2084.76 → 2088.84] this much on eBay. So you know. Relatively close to that. Yeah.
[2088.84 → 2094.44] Yeah. Yeah. So I actually made so much selling a couple of them that mine were effectively like
[2094.44 → 2102.12] a couple of hundred bucks for two. There you go. Yeah. And I bought some Wii motes. So yeah that worked
[2102.12 → 2105.80] out pretty well for me. With that said I don't have the kind of time to do stuff like that. Although
[2106.52 → 2111.80] I have exciting news. When are you seeing Star Wars? I'm waiting. I want to go with Brandon because
[2111.80 → 2115.88] he's good to talk to movies about afterwards and stuff. So I don't actually have a ticket yet because
[2115.88 → 2121.88] he doesn't have a ticket yet. So I this is a major. This is a big shout-out. This is a huge
[2121.88 → 2127.32] massive like. Wait do you have opening day tickets? Well not quite. Okay. But this is a massive shout
[2127.32 → 2135.56] out to Anthony over at NCI who thanks to I'm not going to say how he got them, but it's something to
[2135.56 → 2141.32] do with like a purchase that he made recently and like an owner's club website that probably no one will
[2141.32 → 2148.52] ever visit. There's a special non-public screening at 9 a.m. on the Saturday. Wow.
[2149.32 → 2156.92] 9 a.m. the day after it launches. So he has two tickets, and he was kind of shopping them around
[2156.92 → 2162.12] like and Jack was like yeah I'm going with you know someone else and blah blah blah and like
[2162.12 → 2166.12] and he and I was like, and then he was like oh well I don't know Linus do you want to come do
[2166.12 → 2170.92] you have tickets yet? I'm like actually no because I have children and so going to see like a late night
[2170.92 → 2175.64] screening is not always the easiest thing for me and stuff like that. So I was planning I was
[2175.64 → 2182.28] literally planning to spend three weeks with my eyes closed and my fingers in my ears until I was
[2182.28 → 2188.76] going to be able to see it. Nope. I'm seeing at 9 a.m. So Anthony and I have a master plan to show up
[2188.76 → 2193.64] at like 7 30. It's first come, first served. So we have a master plan to show up at like 7 30 in the
[2193.64 → 2198.44] morning at the theatre, and it's going to be freaking awesome, and I'm going to see it on time pretty much
[2198.44 → 2203.16] for the first come first served, and you're showing up at 7 30 for 9 a.m. But remember this is not a public
[2203.16 → 2208.44] screening. Probably no one knows about it. There wasn't even an email newsletter. Nothing. If you
[2208.44 → 2215.24] happen to sign in to like the owner's portal. Wow, that's unlikely. Yeah. So I'm expecting to be sitting
[2215.24 → 2227.16] like dead theatre centre. Wow. For Star Wars the day after launch. I'm super, super excited. I'm assuming Brandon is going to be waiting a little while because I think he wants perfect seats too. Yeah. So I'm probably going to be
[2227.16 → 2239.16] So I'm probably going to be waiting a while. All I can say is it better not disappoint because the last movie that I like freaked out and saw right away was the Hobbit part 1. Have you heard about the Darth Jar Banks?
[2239.40 → 2245.00] I have. I love it. It's actually pretty good. I actually love it. If you haven't seen the conspiracy theory
[2245.00 → 2257.08] It's pretty solid. That Jar is actually the Sith master orchestrating everything behind the scenes. Check it out. It was a great post on Reddit. It's perfect. Furthermore, it's perfect. There's like,
[2257.08 → 2272.02] It goes all kind of like, well hold on. Yeah. Yeah. What if Jar was all like, like drunken kung fu master kind of thing? Like when he's like jumping around going, oh, a missile, clumsy, boom, knocking out drones and killing them all over the place.
[2273.74 → 2284.46] What if it's all an act? And then he's like inexplicably in the second movie, he's like a member of the Senate. Yeah. Or something like, what? Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. It is actually like,
[2284.46 → 2294.84] He must have been using mind control. I still don't, that's a huge part of the that's a huge part of it. Yeah. And they have clips where he's like doing the hand wavy thing all the time. Fascinating. I don't know.
[2295.48 → 2310.94] It's, it's, it's ridiculous, and it's, yeah, but it's fun, and it makes you not hate so much those series of movies. If you go back and I, I haven't done it yet, but if you rewatch with that in mind, I plan to re, I'm going to reread the whole spiel. Because it's like a couple of pages long. Yeah.
[2310.94 → 2316.62] I'm going to reread the whole spiel. I'm going to watch Phantom Menace again, thinking Jar is a mastermind.
[2317.40 → 2320.80] And trying to mind control and pretend that he's crappy when he's not.
[2320.86 → 2324.66] Yeah. And he got, he got kicked out of the underground city. We know this. He caused all kinds of problems.
[2325.32 → 2335.88] Stupid viewer. We assumed that, you know, he knocked over the, you know, prince's daffodil plant or whatever, but you know, daffodils would be pretty valuable underwater.
[2336.28 → 2336.90] Oh. Yeah.
[2337.06 → 2337.28] Wow.
[2337.34 → 2338.90] It'd probably be a rare, rare commodity.
[2338.90 → 2340.06] Yeah. Probably. Imported.
[2340.94 → 2341.96] Important daffodils.
[2342.64 → 2349.14] So, so, you know, was George Lucas planning, and this is the this is the theory was George Lucas planning a Luke,
[2349.20 → 2352.78] I am your father moment for the end of attack of the clone.
[2353.14 → 2354.64] No, it was me the whole time.
[2354.64 → 2360.26] That never happened. Because he bailed. And obviously not, but yeah.
[2360.56 → 2363.12] It's fun. Anyway, it's, it's really fun. Yeah.
[2363.22 → 2369.34] Speaking of things that are fun. Oh, Scott, our good buddy over at.
[2369.34 → 2374.24] That AMD and not tech report.
[2374.24 → 2375.64] Didn't see that one coming.
[2375.64 → 2377.06] Did not see that one coming.
[2377.06 → 2380.26] Is no longer, is no longer going to be.
[2380.26 → 2381.88] I wonder if we'll get cards on time now.
[2381.96 → 2383.14] Maybe this is a good thing.
[2383.14 → 2384.96] No, he's not in that role.
[2384.96 → 2386.36] Oh yeah. Sorry.
[2386.36 → 2398.18] So, so I, I actually, I've spoken on the phone with Scott since the announcement and I don't know how much of what was said was public knowledge versus what wasn't.
[2398.18 → 2408.94] So I will give a summary of what's in, in his blog post and, and not much more, but I'm gonna, I'm going to be connecting with him at CES, and I'll probably talk in some more depth.
[2408.94 → 2421.06] But just for those of you who don't know, I respect Scott a lot. He's super smart. He's been doing this whole tech journalism thing. Furthermore, he's, he's just such a respectable guy. Furthermore, he's been doing this for over 15 years.
[2421.06 → 2429.90] And, uh, you know what we actually like, we have, uh, uh, we have a partnership with tech report on a couple of things. Like we've worked together on a couple of things in the past.
[2429.90 → 2445.40] Yep. Um, and this just, he is kinda like, I, I, I sent him a tweet that was like, you know, we, we can't bleep things on WAN show. So I'm not going to use the exact words that I did, but it was just basically like what the and you can kind of fill in the blanks for yourself.
[2445.40 → 2450.88] Yeah. Like seriously. Um, and he kind of sends back to the message. He's like,
[2451.06 → 2461.48] Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, dude. I super meant to tell you, but this just like happened really fast. And, you know, AMD hosted an event.
[2461.94 → 2463.06] Some months ago.
[2463.34 → 2475.26] No, no. Some, some months ago, the phone call happened. But then what happened really suddenly was the deal got inked and AMD had an event that they did earlier this week when they announced actually a bunch of really cool stuff.
[2475.26 → 2480.42] We'll talk about that a bit more later. Some Zen architecture stuff. Um, and they were like, well,
[2480.42 → 2490.34] you're going to be at this event with an AMD badge on. So that's tomorrow. So I guess up goes a blog post at 10 43 PM on December the 2nd.
[2490.34 → 2492.50] Oh my goodness. Okay. Yeah.
[2492.50 → 2506.96] Yeah. So that's what happened. And, um, so pretty much he's going to be working at AMD to help implement the frame time based testing methods for game performance that he's been championing at tech report.
[2506.96 → 2518.88] And, um, he'll have an opportunity to, and I'm kind of summarizing his words in the thing, because I don't want to say anything that he didn't say in his post to move across organizational lines and help ensure that the radio on technologies group creates the best possible experience for gamers.
[2518.88 → 2534.26] So he'll have access to engineering, to marketing, to pretty much whatever, with the intention of making the gaming experience in the radio and technologies group, which I kind of looked at that announcement of radio and technologies group and kind of went, Oh, okay.
[2534.26 → 2542.12] So they're kind of going, okay, uh, we're going back to AMD and ATI now. And I kind of figured it would just kind of all be under the same management. It wouldn't really be different.
[2542.12 → 2556.30] Not apparently. No, there's no refocused, renewed vision and focus with, uh, under, uh, Raja Kauri's leadership. And this is going to be a real thing. And they've managed, they've managed to get Scott to drink the Kool-Aid.
[2556.30 → 2559.50] So I am inclined to take a sip of the Kool-Aid myself.
[2559.58 → 2562.00] Radiant technology. So is it RTG now instead of ATI?
[2563.42 → 2564.24] I don't know.
[2564.44 → 2567.14] The new RTG three or four 90.
[2567.36 → 2570.22] They should have just called it ATI. It would have been super cool.
[2570.22 → 2572.92] That would have been so sick. I actually would love that.
[2573.22 → 2585.32] Like, like if it, like if they called it like the like, oh, like AMD, you know, uh, how do we work like a visual or graphics or like, Hmm.
[2586.30 → 2587.82] ATI X 1000.
[2588.54 → 2591.38] Yeah. Or like something, something like that. Anyway.
[2592.34 → 2605.82] So yeah, that was, that was, that kind of, that kind of, that kind of shook me up earlier this week because between, between Scott and Anon Bailing and, uh, that, that's a couple, that's a couple like pretty big, that's a couple pretty big names.
[2605.82 → 2613.20] And one of the few really couple of the, the hardcore written guys that I'm that close to, who's no longer in the space.
[2613.80 → 2615.68] Speaking of which, I haven't talked to Shelton a long time.
[2615.70 → 2616.54] I was just going to say Ryan.
[2616.94 → 2619.78] Um, I asked Scott what's going to happen to Tech Report.
[2619.78 → 2624.80] Obviously he'll be stepping down as editor-in-chief, but I don't know if you guys know this.
[2624.80 → 2627.50] Scott also owns the Tech Report.
[2627.76 → 2638.44] So, um, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that he can't work for AMD and also run an editorial website and own an editorial website at the same time.
[2638.82 → 2641.00] So, uh, something's going to have to happen there.
[2641.14 → 2642.50] Um, I, I asked him about it.
[2642.50 → 2647.48] I can't say anything that he said, but like, yeah, something will have to happen.
[2647.70 → 2647.72] Yeah.
[2647.80 → 2647.96] Yeah.
[2648.10 → 2649.96] I mean, basically there are only a few options.
[2650.40 → 2651.42] He sells it.
[2651.74 → 2652.82] He dissolves it.
[2653.36 → 2655.16] He, uh, shuts it down.
[2655.88 → 2656.44] At this point.
[2656.44 → 2657.54] I guess the two of those are the same.
[2657.54 → 2664.84] From the knowledge that we have from the post, I don't think he's going to shut it down or dissolve it because it says Tech Report will continue under Jeff Amman.
[2665.20 → 2665.34] Yeah.
[2665.62 → 2667.90] Amman, managing editor for the last year and a half.
[2668.08 → 2672.04] So, and they're looking for writers to fill his role on CPU and graphics cards.
[2672.50 → 2672.86] Yeah.
[2672.96 → 2674.00] So there you go.
[2675.08 → 2675.68] What a thing.
[2676.46 → 2681.34] Hopefully this will help them avoid things like the driver problem.
[2681.50 → 2684.68] AMD drivers locking fan speeds at 20% and killing some CPUs.
[2684.68 → 2685.92] It's been patched.
[2686.06 → 2686.54] GPUs.
[2686.62 → 2686.82] Sorry.
[2687.14 → 2688.26] It's been patched.
[2688.40 → 2693.10] Um, I don't usually like talking about these memory kind of things until they're like done.
[2693.28 → 2694.98] So we know if they're actually a thing or not.
[2695.20 → 2695.44] Yeah.
[2695.52 → 2702.08] Or like confirmed that it's an actual issue because I mean, two people on a forum.
[2702.50 → 2707.14] Can like to have their GTX 980 die after a patch.
[2707.14 → 2708.94] And I'm not really going to want to test it.
[2709.02 → 2709.54] After a driver.
[2709.54 → 2710.52] Because I don't really want mine to die.
[2710.64 → 2710.92] Yeah.
[2711.60 → 2713.64] So like, I don't know.
[2713.72 → 2715.60] We're just going to wait until it's official, and then we'll talk about it.
[2715.64 → 2720.76] So yeah, I had some people messaging us, messaging me asking about why we haven't been talking about the driver thing.
[2720.90 → 2721.48] It's because like.
[2721.48 → 2723.16] Anyway, it was a thing.
[2723.46 → 2724.40] It is fixed now.
[2724.54 → 2726.30] So it is safe to update your drivers.
[2726.52 → 2729.70] But basically the fan speed was locking way too low.
[2729.88 → 2734.04] Either at 20% or some people apparently having it go up to 100%.
[2734.04 → 2735.44] So things are weird.
[2736.12 → 2736.86] I don't know.
[2737.28 → 2737.42] Yeah.
[2737.62 → 2738.66] So it's fixed now.
[2738.66 → 2743.04] So we all know who to yell at next time this happens.
[2743.28 → 2744.36] You now have a public figure.
[2744.50 → 2744.74] Yeah.
[2744.90 → 2745.58] Go for it.
[2745.60 → 2748.94] I don't know how forward facing he's going to be.
[2749.72 → 2752.06] Yeah, but I'm sure his Twitter and stuff is still going to survive.
[2752.58 → 2753.06] I don't know.
[2753.12 → 2753.64] Maybe not.
[2753.80 → 2754.04] I mean.
[2754.26 → 2755.54] Is he going to delete his Twitter?
[2755.72 → 2755.92] Okay.
[2756.00 → 2757.30] So here are a couple of things.
[2757.30 → 2766.60] Like you look at Roy Taylor from AMD whose Twitter disappeared off the face of the earth overnight and seems to be back.
[2767.18 → 2769.86] I think he's back on Twitter, but under a different handle.
[2770.42 → 2770.54] Oh.
[2770.88 → 2771.18] Yeah.
[2771.26 → 2774.14] It's Roy underscore Tech wood.
[2775.00 → 2775.52] Whoa.
[2776.26 → 2783.44] And I had sort of, I had sort of like my initial reaction when I saw this.
[2783.44 → 2784.86] That's a fair amount of tweets.
[2785.10 → 2785.34] Yeah.
[2785.34 → 2788.10] No, no, this is, this is new, but he's only got like 4,000 followers.
[2788.32 → 2791.30] He had like, like over a hundred thousand followers before.
[2791.40 → 2791.54] Yeah.
[2792.16 → 2794.72] So site is still AMD.com.
[2794.84 → 2797.38] Like I, I, I don't really understand.
[2797.68 → 2799.36] I don't really understand what happened here.
[2800.12 → 2800.52] Um.
[2800.62 → 2801.06] I don't know.
[2801.62 → 2802.02] Anyway.
[2802.20 → 2808.42] So it seems like someone at AMD learned their lesson about just letting employees talk on Twitter.
[2809.14 → 2811.18] Um, or maybe didn't because he's back.
[2811.24 → 2812.60] Like I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[2812.60 → 2814.66] I don't know the backstory of what happened there.
[2815.34 → 2820.18] And you know, there's just because someone is good at being public facing doesn't mean
[2820.18 → 2821.20] that they'll be public facing.
[2821.30 → 2822.46] I mean, you look at, I look at.
[2822.46 → 2825.74] I don't think you can ban someone from having a Twitter account though.
[2826.44 → 2826.86] If you.
[2827.04 → 2828.18] You can tell them not to post.
[2829.68 → 2829.88] Uh.
[2829.88 → 2830.76] Like, okay.
[2830.90 → 2833.94] Have you heard, have you heard anything from Anand since he left Anand tech?
[2834.54 → 2836.20] No, but that's, I don't.
[2836.26 → 2836.98] He's at Apple though.
[2837.10 → 2837.72] I don't think.
[2838.06 → 2838.30] Yeah.
[2838.38 → 2842.76] But I don't think Apple is even able to tell you to not have a personal Twitter account.
[2842.98 → 2843.60] Of course.
[2843.98 → 2845.14] They could fire you for using it.
[2845.14 → 2847.64] Um, they could fire you for saying things about Apple.
[2848.04 → 2848.32] Okay.
[2848.42 → 2849.60] That's, that's possible.
[2849.76 → 2852.24] They, I don't think they can fire you for just using Twitter.
[2852.70 → 2858.78] Um, but at the same time, like what I'm saying here is Scott might not reply to people, but
[2858.78 → 2860.20] if you're like, Oh my God, what the hell?
[2860.44 → 2862.90] You could message him, and then he could maybe forward that internally.
[2863.10 → 2866.96] You might never hear about it, but he still would probably be able to be contacted.
[2867.06 → 2867.30] Maybe.
[2867.72 → 2867.98] Maybe.
[2867.98 → 2868.70] It's possible.
[2868.86 → 2869.90] Unless he deletes his Twitter.
[2870.26 → 2871.18] Unless he deletes his Twitter.
[2871.18 → 2872.46] Very also possible.
[2873.00 → 2878.92] Um, speaking of deleting Twitter, uh, actually not related to deleting Twitter at all.
[2879.30 → 2879.70] Squarespace.
[2880.06 → 2880.42] Yay.
[2880.44 → 2881.80] One of our sponsors for today.
[2882.06 → 2883.88] You can have a Twitter feed on your Squarespace page.
[2884.08 → 2884.98] Which you can, actually.
[2885.10 → 2886.70] We know this from firsthand experience.
[2886.72 → 2887.54] Yeah, we're working on that.
[2887.54 → 2891.58] We're working on a special Squarespace page for our CES coverage because Squarespace is
[2891.58 → 2896.02] going to be our sponsor, our main sponsor for CES this year.
[2896.20 → 2898.36] Oh, apparently the video feed is frozen.
[2899.36 → 2899.58] Oh.
[2899.72 → 2900.30] Oh, great.
[2900.46 → 2900.82] That's fun.
[2900.82 → 2902.26] Oh, that's a great freeze-frame.
[2902.44 → 2904.26] We should just do the still image, Sancho.
[2904.70 → 2905.18] It's fine.
[2905.22 → 2905.44] Don't worry.
[2905.50 → 2907.06] But don't, don't even bother fix it.
[2907.62 → 2908.94] Just, it's cool.
[2909.48 → 2911.16] I wonder if they can see that.
[2911.62 → 2912.12] Oh, yeah.
[2912.90 → 2913.38] Add.
[2913.88 → 2916.40] See, this is the kind of, this is the kind of crap that we go through.
[2916.74 → 2917.18] Oh, wow.
[2917.82 → 2919.32] If you just add a bunch of them.
[2919.68 → 2925.74] If you were able to change the still frame, you could rapidly add them, and then we could
[2925.74 → 2928.90] have like a moving picture, like one, maybe less than one FPS.
[2928.90 → 2929.30] Okay.
[2929.30 → 2929.34] Okay.
[2929.34 → 2931.42] So let's find out if this is going to blue screen.
[2931.82 → 2932.68] You're a blue screen.
[2933.46 → 2934.92] I'm about to be potentially.
[2936.62 → 2937.02] Okay.
[2938.76 → 2940.18] Did you ever play Magic ka?
[2940.18 → 2944.56] We'll be right back after these messages.
[2944.80 → 2945.14] No, wait.
[2945.24 → 2946.66] It was the messages that got interrupted.
[2946.72 → 2949.14] We'll be right back after we, I don't know.
[2949.74 → 2950.24] We're doing something.
[2950.24 → 2950.54] Hold on.
[2950.64 → 2951.42] We might have an idea.
[2952.08 → 2953.26] I'm going to keep talking to you guys.
[2953.34 → 2954.20] How's your day going?
[2954.56 → 2956.60] Before the show started, I did two quizzes.
[2956.60 → 2960.00] One of them was, what is your favourite type of apple?
[2960.40 → 2962.96] And the other one was waffles or pancakes.
[2963.56 → 2967.56] I'm going to actually make a straw poll right now, and I'm going to post that in the Twitch
[2967.56 → 2967.86] feed.
[2968.20 → 2970.30] I want you guys to answer both questions.
[2970.58 → 2972.26] Both questions are going to be on one straw poll.
[2972.38 → 2975.58] I know this is pretty like next level, but we're going to do this right now.
[2975.64 → 2976.34] So give me one second.
[2976.80 → 2978.46] Straw poll dot me, right?
[2978.46 → 2978.70] Hmm.
[2979.70 → 2980.42] That's interesting.
[2980.88 → 2981.12] Yeah.
[2981.32 → 2981.70] Whoa.
[2981.88 → 2982.30] Nope.
[2982.50 → 2983.46] Not straw poll dot me.
[2983.56 → 2984.00] Okay.
[2984.38 → 2984.90] Um.
[2985.28 → 2985.78] Mm-hmm.
[2985.94 → 2986.26] Okay.
[2987.30 → 2987.86] Wait, what?
[2987.94 → 2988.32] It is.
[2988.62 → 2990.00] Let's try your, uh.
[2990.08 → 2991.08] I'm confused.
[2991.14 → 2992.42] I'm plugging it back in.
[2992.42 → 2995.62] Apples and breakfast foods.
[2998.42 → 2998.90] Wow.
[2999.04 → 3001.82] How do I ask what people's favourite type of apple is on straw poll?
[3002.08 → 3003.24] Would I have to list all of them?
[3003.42 → 3004.22] I think so.
[3004.80 → 3005.62] Granny Smith.
[3005.62 → 3007.90] I think you'd have to do Twitter blitz if you wanted to, uh.
[3007.90 → 3009.86] Okay, we can do both at the same time.
[3010.06 → 3012.90] So I'm going to straw poll, uh, waffles or pancakes.
[3013.04 → 3015.06] I'm going to Twitter blitz favourite apple.
[3015.50 → 3015.86] Okay.
[3016.02 → 3017.28] Twitter blitz favourite apple.
[3017.48 → 3019.90] I, I don't think we're going to get this back up and running.
[3020.02 → 3025.42] This is, uh, this is, this is the thing that happened that is, that is not making me super
[3025.42 → 3026.22] happy right now.
[3026.66 → 3027.02] Uh.
[3027.16 → 3027.86] Video input.
[3028.08 → 3028.84] No signal.
[3029.00 → 3029.24] Wait.
[3030.76 → 3031.48] I think my camera.
[3031.48 → 3032.92] Did the camera turn off?
[3034.00 → 3036.36] No one's watching the power adapter for the camera.
[3036.36 → 3037.44] Holy hell.
[3037.90 → 3042.10] I mean, uh, Diablo, uh, what, uh.
[3042.56 → 3043.70] Really, you guys?
[3044.20 → 3044.52] Really.
[3045.06 → 3047.30] Today, camera setup was a problem.
[3048.78 → 3052.18] Camera setup was a huge problem, like, all over the place.
[3052.30 → 3052.86] Just saying.
[3053.84 → 3055.16] That was brutal.
[3058.74 → 3059.26] Yes!
[3059.76 → 3061.14] I'm in the middle of your show.
[3062.48 → 3063.58] I don't know what that means.
[3063.58 → 3064.48] Is that going to work now?
[3064.48 → 3065.60] You're going to work now.
[3065.60 → 3065.88] I hope so.
[3068.88 → 3070.70] And we're back.
[3070.78 → 3071.34] I hope.
[3071.94 → 3072.64] Are we back?
[3073.34 → 3073.70] Hello?
[3074.42 → 3074.70] Hello?
[3075.76 → 3077.00] Oh, oh, wow.
[3077.06 → 3077.74] That's dirty looking.
[3077.82 → 3078.04] Yeah!
[3078.90 → 3079.18] Woo!
[3079.94 → 3081.52] Without even losing it.
[3081.52 → 3084.82] Okay, so let's finish your Twitter blitz here, alright?
[3085.04 → 3086.44] And then we'll get back to our sponsors.
[3086.44 → 3086.98] There we go.
[3087.50 → 3090.82] Alright, waffles and golden delicious, because they are waffle.
[3091.16 → 3091.38] Granny Smith.
[3091.38 → 3092.18] Excuse me, delicious.
[3093.14 → 3093.64] Granny Smith?
[3093.98 → 3099.92] Granny Smith is, like, the most boring name for the most, like, sour, intense apple that there is.
[3099.92 → 3100.94] I love Granny Smith apples.
[3101.00 → 3102.26] Granny Smith was covered in caramel.
[3102.78 → 3103.42] So good.
[3103.62 → 3103.74] Oh.
[3103.90 → 3106.66] And those were also the best candy apples that I've ever had.
[3106.82 → 3107.50] Yeah, yeah.
[3107.60 → 3109.92] My wife made candy apples this Halloween.
[3110.72 → 3113.68] It was, like, to die for.
[3113.68 → 3114.00] Yeah.
[3114.26 → 3116.68] And you'd think there's nothing to it.
[3117.82 → 3118.46] Like, what?
[3118.54 → 3120.68] It's caramel, which is basically sugar.
[3121.58 → 3121.90] Yep.
[3122.28 → 3123.80] And you dip a freaking apple in it.
[3123.82 → 3124.14] How complicated is this?
[3124.14 → 3128.90] So the thing is, she did caramel, and then she did chocolate, and then she did Smarty's?
[3128.90 → 3130.20] Just decorative candies.
[3130.20 → 3130.62] M&M's or something?
[3130.70 → 3131.26] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3131.26 → 3131.56] Lots of different candies.
[3131.84 → 3133.40] Like, it was a lot.
[3133.54 → 3134.90] Your mouth was just like, whoa, dude.
[3135.34 → 3136.00] Like, the whole time.
[3136.16 → 3140.14] Favourite Apple iPad Pro with full NVMe SSD and running Windows.
[3140.72 → 3141.36] Poor Granny Smith.
[3141.36 → 3142.36] That's actually pretty legit.
[3142.48 → 3142.72] Gotcha.
[3142.90 → 3144.54] I would actually, I would be into that.
[3144.58 → 3145.48] I'd be super down with that.
[3145.48 → 3146.04] It is for Apple.
[3146.12 → 3146.58] Thank you.
[3146.66 → 3147.76] KidsTV123.
[3148.06 → 3149.30] Granny Smith all the way.
[3149.42 → 3150.44] Granny Smith and waffles.
[3150.72 → 3152.30] Probably Fuji Gala or Raeburn.
[3152.46 → 3152.90] Yeah, okay.
[3153.22 → 3153.48] Okay.
[3153.48 → 3155.50] I'm into the Fuji apples.
[3156.18 → 3157.30] I'm into the Fuji apples.
[3157.42 → 3157.68] All right.
[3157.72 → 3162.54] So let's get back to Squarespace.
[3164.18 → 3165.70] It only works on my side.
[3166.12 → 3166.70] Squarespace build it tricky.
[3166.70 → 3168.92] Ah, there's four Linus's to only one Luke.
[3169.02 → 3170.00] No, my chest is here.
[3170.32 → 3170.72] Look at this.
[3171.16 → 3172.24] Oh, yeah, that's true.
[3172.70 → 3174.28] We get all the Luke boob age.
[3175.36 → 3175.72] Okay.
[3175.96 → 3177.10] So I'm going to fix that.
[3177.24 → 3179.26] I don't really know what I was thinking when I did that.
[3179.26 → 3180.40] I was a little confused.
[3180.48 → 3181.68] I thought you were just trying to make a joke.
[3181.94 → 3182.28] I was.
[3182.34 → 3183.18] I was just dicking around.
[3183.18 → 3183.36] Yeah.
[3183.48 → 3183.64] Yeah.
[3183.86 → 3184.34] Okay.
[3184.58 → 3187.44] So Squarespace is actually going to be our sponsor at CES this year.
[3187.70 → 3188.32] Oh, my God.
[3188.38 → 3189.56] How many times I didn't.
[3189.78 → 3191.20] How many times do we get to say Build It Beautiful?
[3191.30 → 3192.26] Are they on every video?
[3193.04 → 3193.38] Yeah.
[3194.82 → 3195.30] Yes.
[3195.30 → 3203.22] I can feel the dankness of the memes already on PC Master Race.
[3204.44 → 3206.78] Last year was Linus dropping things.
[3206.98 → 3208.96] This year, it's going to be Build It Beautiful.
[3209.32 → 3211.80] I'm going to be way too happy to say that every time.
[3211.80 → 3212.12] Okay.
[3212.12 → 3212.16] Okay.
[3212.28 → 3216.92] So what is Squarespace, if you don't already know from watching the WAN show faithfully every
[3216.92 → 3218.32] week, like you probably do.
[3218.46 → 3218.70] Yeah.
[3218.92 → 3219.32] Yeah.
[3219.82 → 3220.22] Yeah.
[3220.22 → 3220.72] Maybe not.
[3220.72 → 3224.92] Is that it is for building a beautiful website.
[3225.24 → 3225.28] Yeah.
[3225.28 → 3226.50] It's simple to use.
[3226.54 → 3227.14] It's powerful.
[3227.56 → 3228.46] It's got a web GUI.
[3228.54 → 3230.72] You just kind of build your site there and boom, it's up.
[3231.10 → 3233.72] Squarespace handles the hosting so you don't have to deal with any of that crap.
[3233.72 → 3239.92] They've got 24-7 tech support and all of their templates are featuring responsive designs.
[3240.00 → 3240.78] They look great on a phone.
[3240.84 → 3242.32] They look great on a full-size screen.
[3242.44 → 3246.40] They've got commerce modules that come with every site, and you can start a free trial with
[3246.40 → 3249.92] no credit card required and start building your website today.
[3250.30 → 3250.62] Squarespace.
[3250.94 → 3255.18] It starts at only eight bucks a month, and you can get 10% off your first purchase by using
[3255.18 → 3257.24] offer code Linus.
[3257.90 → 3258.34] Squarespace.
[3258.66 → 3259.14] Build It Beautiful.
[3259.42 → 3260.34] Thank you, Luke.
[3260.74 → 3260.96] Yeah.
[3260.96 → 3261.88] Tunnel Bear.
[3261.88 → 3265.64] I actually saw a hilarious parody.
[3266.28 → 3268.66] It was like me doing a presidential speech.
[3269.12 → 3272.78] Someone grabbed like a still frame of our background.
[3273.12 → 3273.84] You found those funny?
[3273.88 → 3275.06] And then like animated.
[3275.30 → 3281.92] I found the one funny because the part about my plan for Canada.
[3282.24 → 3283.52] Oh, like all the sponsorships?
[3283.64 → 3285.72] Like everyone will have butt wipes and everything?
[3285.72 → 3290.00] So Canada will be corporate sponsored instead of charging its citizens taxes.
[3290.00 → 3290.36] Yeah.
[3290.36 → 3292.06] Which, you know what?
[3292.22 → 3293.66] It's actually a fascinating idea.
[3293.66 → 3293.76] Hold on a second.
[3293.78 → 3299.40] If we took all the money that gets paid to the government in like lobbying and actually
[3299.40 → 3301.60] just spent it on something useful.
[3302.02 → 3303.00] That'd be pretty sick.
[3303.32 → 3304.26] Hold on a minute.
[3304.58 → 3306.12] We might be onto something here anyway.
[3306.30 → 3311.06] The problem is then the people that are receiving the lobbying money wouldn't get paid.
[3311.14 → 3311.90] So that would never happen.
[3312.06 → 3312.36] Right.
[3312.36 → 3314.22] Because it's all about them being super rich.
[3314.42 → 3314.78] I know.
[3315.14 → 3315.60] I know.
[3315.74 → 3316.28] But like.
[3316.88 → 3321.34] You're basically like if people weren't dick holes about making excessive amounts of money,
[3321.42 → 3322.88] imagine how good the world would be.
[3322.96 → 3323.24] Yes.
[3323.96 → 3324.24] Okay.
[3324.30 → 3325.02] So Tunnel Bear.
[3325.18 → 3329.40] Speaking of not being that word he said that some people consider a swear word.
[3329.54 → 3329.74] Is it?
[3329.74 → 3330.42] Yeah.
[3330.42 → 3330.86] I don't.
[3331.28 → 3331.46] Yeah.
[3331.58 → 3333.30] Some people censor dick.
[3334.42 → 3335.46] Swear words are so confusing.
[3335.56 → 3335.88] I know.
[3335.88 → 3336.62] I actually never know.
[3337.00 → 3337.42] I know.
[3337.42 → 3338.78] And there are lists out there.
[3338.90 → 3341.30] But then there's like competing lists.
[3341.50 → 3342.86] And some of them are drastically different.
[3343.08 → 3343.48] I know.
[3343.60 → 3343.98] I know.
[3344.12 → 3344.52] I know.
[3344.78 → 3345.16] Anyway.
[3345.32 → 3345.86] Tunnel Bear.
[3345.86 → 3350.94] The easy-to-use VPN that hopefully doesn't mind us using naughty words while we talk about
[3350.94 → 3352.94] their service with the lower third on the screen.
[3353.06 → 3356.76] Tunnel Bear does not in any way endorse the use of the word d-hole.
[3358.12 → 3359.32] That sounds worse.
[3359.56 → 3360.24] It does.
[3362.64 → 3363.12] Okay.
[3363.12 → 3365.64] You can tunnel up to I think 13 different countries.
[3365.76 → 3366.08] 16.
[3366.22 → 3366.90] 16 different countries.
[3366.90 → 3367.96] 16 different countries.
[3368.12 → 3370.70] They have apps for iOS, Android, PC, and Mac.
[3370.88 → 3372.26] They also have a Chrome extension.
[3372.48 → 3373.96] They're super easy to use.
[3374.08 → 3374.24] They are.
[3374.24 → 3377.40] Just pick the country in the app and turn Tunnel Bear on.
[3377.46 → 3381.06] Watch your bear tunnel through that country with AES 256-bit encryption.
[3381.78 → 3385.64] And it switches your public IP address so you appear to the websites and services you're
[3385.64 → 3388.86] using as though you are from that country.
[3389.16 → 3392.18] They fix the annoying parts of using a VPN for personal use.
[3392.34 → 3395.54] You don't have to mess around with port configuration, DNS, or any router settings.
[3395.54 → 3396.84] They handle that in the background.
[3397.10 → 3400.38] And they give you 500 legs of data for free.
[3400.54 → 3401.48] So you can try it out.
[3401.58 → 3403.34] No credit card required.
[3403.34 → 3407.62] And if you want to upgrade to unlimited data, you can save 10% by going to tunnelbear.com
[3407.62 → 3409.22] slash LTT.
[3409.22 → 3411.78] All right.
[3411.78 → 3415.00] So now that Nick has...
[3415.00 → 3419.24] Oh, he has informed me that he is not that likely to suffer from heart disease.
[3419.78 → 3426.06] So if he's to get some kind of disease from us messing up our sponsor integrations all the
[3426.06 → 3427.58] time, it will probably be cancer.
[3427.94 → 3428.12] Oh.
[3428.42 → 3428.62] Yeah.
[3428.94 → 3429.28] Okay.
[3429.68 → 3431.58] So I've been corrected.
[3432.14 → 3432.46] So...
[3432.46 → 3433.68] I don't know.
[3433.74 → 3434.60] I don't know what's worse.
[3434.60 → 3435.68] I...
[3435.68 → 3437.16] Well, they're both terrible.
[3437.38 → 3437.58] Yeah.
[3437.90 → 3438.10] Yeah.
[3438.10 → 3438.14] Yeah.
[3438.14 → 3438.96] They're both like absolutely...
[3438.96 → 3441.62] Are they both just like at the full volume level?
[3441.76 → 3442.92] Like it's just they're both...
[3442.92 → 3444.38] You can't really get any more than that?
[3444.42 → 3445.06] I don't know.
[3445.16 → 3445.42] Okay.
[3445.42 → 3445.98] Because there's like...
[3445.98 → 3449.48] Oh, speaking of heart disease, I found out Rocket has a heart murmur.
[3450.22 → 3450.62] What?
[3450.72 → 3450.88] Yeah.
[3450.88 → 3453.08] So he might have to be on like blood thinners for the rest of his life.
[3453.12 → 3453.64] That's interesting.
[3453.80 → 3454.06] Whoa.
[3454.06 → 3454.58] Yeah.
[3454.84 → 3456.80] So like pet insurance, kids.
[3457.68 → 3458.46] That's a thing.
[3458.74 → 3459.52] No, I don't have it.
[3459.84 → 3460.04] Oh.
[3460.22 → 3461.50] So that's going to be expensive.
[3461.78 → 3462.10] Oh.
[3462.18 → 3466.00] Because I'm pretty sure you can't buy pet insurance for in case he develops a heart murmur when
[3466.00 → 3466.98] he already has one.
[3467.08 → 3467.28] Yeah.
[3467.46 → 3469.12] That said, my vet's a family friend.
[3469.78 → 3471.22] Maybe they could discover it later.
[3471.22 → 3472.20] Has not developed yet.
[3477.64 → 3479.72] I recommend using an honest vet.
[3479.72 → 3484.24] It's probably a good idea.
[3484.38 → 3484.52] Yeah.
[3485.32 → 3488.22] So this was posted on the forum by Evil E. Muir.
[3488.86 → 3490.34] Tiger Direct to...
[3490.34 → 3490.60] Oops.
[3490.72 → 3491.24] Wrong scene.
[3491.44 → 3491.54] Oops.
[3491.94 → 3496.08] Tiger Direct to lay off 241 workers in January.
[3496.66 → 3500.82] They were recently sold to PC Mall for $14 million.
[3501.26 → 3502.86] You know what's crazy about this?
[3503.42 → 3509.70] Is like my memories of Tiger Direct are like back in the days at NCIS.
[3509.72 → 3513.02] You know, eight to three years ago.
[3513.34 → 3516.80] When they were like a legit competitor in the PC space.
[3516.90 → 3519.14] And it was like the big three.
[3519.74 → 3525.02] Was your New egg, your Tiger, and like I'm just trying to think who else was like a big...
[3525.02 → 3527.40] I don't even think Amazon was on the radar at that point.
[3527.46 → 3529.56] Not quite yet, but they definitely are now.
[3529.60 → 3531.74] But like Tiger, Tiger came...
[3531.74 → 3533.12] No, it would have been Zip Zoom.
[3533.76 → 3534.66] Zip Zoom Fly.
[3535.10 → 3535.36] Oh, yeah.
[3535.60 → 3536.52] Yeah, they've gone forever.
[3536.52 → 3546.54] So it was like back when like, you know, yeah, Tiger Direct and Comp USA, who was actually acquired by Tiger Direct.
[3546.64 → 3547.72] Like that's what a big deal they were.
[3547.78 → 3550.28] They were just like running around buying up Comp USA stores.
[3550.28 → 3553.48] So they closed a bunch of stores a while ago.
[3553.48 → 3555.48] And they have gotten rid of...
[3556.14 → 3558.40] They've sold to PC Mall.
[3558.74 → 3567.88] Which I have actually discovered only recently that the reason that they probably liquidated all those assets is actually to do with taxation purposes.
[3567.88 → 3574.16] Because if you sell a company and you more than...
[3574.16 → 3580.76] Less than 10% or something to do with being like active assets or something like that.
[3580.90 → 3582.58] Like if it's like just sitting there.
[3582.64 → 3588.04] If you have like a bunch of money sitting there or a bunch of buildings sitting there, then you get taxed a lot more on that or something.
[3588.40 → 3589.10] That's okay.
[3589.52 → 3589.96] Yeah.
[3590.96 → 3592.58] Things I would never know.
[3592.58 → 3592.94] Yeah.
[3595.42 → 3595.94] All right.
[3595.96 → 3598.20] Why don't we blow through some of these sort of boring things?
[3598.44 → 3599.40] Tweak Town article.
[3599.66 → 3603.12] NVIDIA rumoured to be preparing a GeForce GTX 960 Ti.
[3603.38 → 3606.48] It'll be faster than a 960 but slower than a 970.
[3608.18 → 3609.86] And you can take that to the bank.
[3610.22 → 3611.80] Sam Stretcher posted that on the forum.
[3611.80 → 3618.66] The Radeon Fury X2 Gemini could be paper launching later this month according to WCCF Tech.
[3618.74 → 3622.00] Availability in Q1 2016 could face potential delays.
[3622.12 → 3625.46] I think that says everything we need to know right in the headline.
[3626.00 → 3626.92] What will Gemini be?
[3627.02 → 3630.22] It will be two Fury GPUs on a single card.
[3631.36 → 3634.04] NVIDIA seems to have kind of just bailed on the whole dual GPU thing.
[3634.04 → 3634.60] Good.
[3636.66 → 3637.18] Oh.
[3637.72 → 3638.24] God.
[3639.44 → 3640.80] So done with it.
[3640.80 → 3642.86] Don't want it.
[3643.16 → 3643.64] Oh.
[3643.86 → 3644.70] There's a new gate.
[3645.72 → 3646.58] There's a new gate?
[3646.64 → 3647.38] There's a new gate.
[3647.64 → 3648.88] It's bend gate again.
[3649.26 → 3649.68] Oh.
[3649.94 → 3651.64] But this time, check this out.
[3652.62 → 3653.00] Oh.
[3653.56 → 3654.82] It's CPU bend gate.
[3655.80 → 3657.14] Oh, I've heard about this.
[3657.14 → 3657.36] Yeah.
[3657.70 → 3661.78] Intel's looking into reports but says there could be several variables at play.
[3661.78 → 3669.58] But apparently using the rated mounting pressure after market CPU coolers, which by the way,
[3669.74 → 3673.58] if you bought a Skylike K-series processor is all you're going to be using since there
[3673.58 → 3675.42] is no stock cooler that comes in the box.
[3675.56 → 3675.70] Yeah.
[3675.76 → 3680.32] Although you could buy a box cooler from someone else who isn't using it.
[3680.62 → 3683.26] And speaking of which, we need to get some box coolers.
[3683.94 → 3687.68] We have like two 1151 box coolers left in the entire building.
[3687.68 → 3688.72] I don't know what happened to that.
[3688.78 → 3690.02] What happened to the one I painted black?
[3690.10 → 3691.54] Remember we had the pyramid?
[3691.66 → 3691.76] Yeah.
[3691.78 → 3693.30] We had a literal pyramid of them.
[3693.30 → 3693.76] What happened to them all?
[3693.76 → 3696.00] I made a pyramid because I was like, I have too many of these in my office.
[3696.06 → 3699.40] So I built a pyramid on someone else's desk as a joke and then like didn't want them
[3699.40 → 3699.72] back.
[3699.96 → 3700.16] Yeah.
[3700.22 → 3701.18] They're like all gone.
[3701.46 → 3702.20] And now.
[3702.20 → 3705.38] There's one that I can't figure out what it's for because it's not 775.
[3705.74 → 3706.36] It's not 13.
[3706.44 → 3710.00] It's like smaller than 1155 but bigger than 775.
[3710.00 → 3711.38] I don't know what the crap it is.
[3711.58 → 3712.98] It's an Intel box cooler.
[3713.30 → 3713.94] So like.
[3714.42 → 3715.14] I don't know.
[3715.18 → 3715.68] I don't know.
[3716.12 → 3716.52] Anyway.
[3718.00 → 3718.84] So yeah.
[3719.06 → 3719.94] Where's the black one?
[3720.26 → 3720.90] I don't know.
[3721.18 → 3722.00] I liked that one.
[3722.02 → 3722.38] Right?
[3722.38 → 3723.66] I actually used it quite a few times.
[3723.72 → 3724.18] And we even.
[3724.46 → 3725.58] Because it looked really nice in B-roll.
[3725.70 → 3725.86] Yeah.
[3725.96 → 3726.30] Exactly.
[3727.00 → 3727.58] Well, you know what?
[3727.62 → 3728.88] There's probably one in this box.
[3729.94 → 3730.72] But isn't that.
[3730.98 → 3731.16] Yep.
[3731.52 → 3732.18] That's the black one.
[3732.44 → 3732.78] Oh.
[3734.06 → 3734.44] Okay.
[3734.52 → 3735.24] There it is.
[3735.34 → 3736.06] We found that one.
[3736.28 → 3737.12] It's in the stream machine.
[3737.12 → 3740.16] Maybe that's what's causing all the problems.
[3740.16 → 3740.90] Just take it out.
[3741.48 → 3743.96] Take out the painted CPU cooler.
[3744.54 → 3746.50] It's getting paint flakes on everything.
[3747.96 → 3748.72] So right.
[3748.98 → 3753.92] So Haswell CPUs apparently had a thicker substrate that caused them to not bend.
[3754.06 → 3755.62] And that's the allegation.
[3756.06 → 3761.52] But Intel has obviously neither confirmed nor denied that this is the case up until this point.
[3761.60 → 3761.98] Yeah.
[3761.98 → 3769.00] Scythe has offered a solution offering new screws for their coolers to reduce the mounting pressure.
[3769.40 → 3771.16] I didn't even know Scythe was still in business.
[3771.32 → 3772.22] Neither did I.
[3772.40 → 3772.74] Okay.
[3772.94 → 3775.70] Do you remember their crazy one that went across your entire computer?
[3776.38 → 3776.94] Yes, I do.
[3777.04 → 3777.20] Yeah.
[3777.28 → 3778.46] I forget what it was called though.
[3778.46 → 3778.60] I don't remember.
[3778.60 → 3779.52] Like a Eugen?
[3781.28 → 3781.72] Sure.
[3783.64 → 3785.94] Scythe giant CPU cooler.
[3785.94 → 3786.92] This will probably work.
[3786.92 → 3790.38] I know that Cooler Master had a redone one that um.
[3790.38 → 3790.64] Nope.
[3790.66 → 3791.18] That's not the one.
[3791.30 → 3791.56] Oh.
[3791.84 → 3792.02] Yeah.
[3792.10 → 3792.48] There it is.
[3792.52 → 3792.78] Yep.
[3793.90 → 3794.42] There you go.
[3794.52 → 3796.30] So this picture is from Silent PC Review.
[3796.92 → 3797.14] Yeah.
[3797.14 → 3799.28] Just making sure I'm giving credit where credit is due.
[3799.42 → 3799.88] So yep.
[3800.08 → 3801.36] It's probably not all that silent.
[3802.06 → 3802.28] No.
[3802.34 → 3803.06] It probably is.
[3803.28 → 3804.18] Oh you just turn them all super slow.
[3804.18 → 3804.38] Yeah.
[3804.48 → 3807.74] If you run the fans at like 400 RPM or something stupid like that.
[3807.98 → 3808.16] Yeah.
[3808.42 → 3809.70] Then here it is installed in the case.
[3810.14 → 3813.24] I love that thing.
[3813.56 → 3814.10] It's like yeah.
[3814.10 → 3816.50] If you want to just you know heat up your graphics card more.
[3817.30 → 3817.70] No.
[3818.26 → 3819.74] Look it's going to blow air on top of it.
[3819.98 → 3820.70] Okay yeah.
[3820.90 → 3824.54] But like the surface area of this thing is so huge.
[3824.62 → 3827.78] That the actual heating up of the air that's being done.
[3828.02 → 3830.02] This is actually something that I've been meaning.
[3830.02 → 3832.06] We should find a way to tackle this in a video.
[3832.52 → 3835.42] Because a lot of people have this misconception.
[3836.32 → 3839.20] That like when you got it.
[3839.28 → 3839.48] Okay.
[3839.48 → 3841.86] When your CPU is 70 degrees.
[3842.66 → 3845.52] Your heat sink is going to be less than that.
[3845.60 → 3848.48] Let's say your heat sink is at 40 degrees or something like that.
[3848.68 → 3850.14] And people have this misconception.
[3850.40 → 3852.84] That when 25 degree air runs through those fins.
[3853.46 → 3855.66] It's 40 degrees on the other side.
[3856.18 → 3857.66] And you're now.
[3857.86 → 3860.18] You're heating up the components on the other side.
[3860.24 → 3861.52] This is not how it works.
[3861.94 → 3862.72] At all.
[3862.88 → 3863.78] A little bit.
[3863.78 → 3864.36] A little.
[3864.74 → 3865.60] Not much.
[3866.74 → 3869.60] Slightly warmer airflow that came through a heat sink.
[3869.72 → 3871.06] Is still better than.
[3871.20 → 3871.72] Than no air flow.
[3871.72 → 3872.04] Nothing.
[3872.30 → 3872.48] Yeah.
[3872.84 → 3874.20] And so I've seen people go.
[3874.30 → 3876.18] Oh my goodness Linus.
[3876.18 → 3879.08] You mounted that all in one liquid cooler.
[3879.44 → 3879.96] Backwards.
[3880.04 → 3881.36] Drawing air into the system.
[3882.02 → 3882.92] Now you're just.
[3883.02 → 3884.56] You're heating your graphics card.
[3885.44 → 3885.88] No.
[3886.30 → 3887.82] The air that comes through that cooler.
[3888.16 → 3889.40] Is still cooler.
[3889.56 → 3890.84] Than my graphics card.
[3890.96 → 3892.20] I was mostly joking.
[3892.20 → 3893.62] No I know but.
[3893.72 → 3893.92] Okay.
[3893.98 → 3895.02] No but people aren't.
[3895.12 → 3895.26] Yeah.
[3895.34 → 3896.04] No I know you know.
[3896.16 → 3896.26] Yeah.
[3896.44 → 3898.24] No but people don't know this.
[3898.52 → 3899.04] People are like.
[3899.16 → 3900.96] Oh you've got two radiators in series.
[3901.06 → 3902.10] Well we were going to do that other.
[3902.76 → 3903.46] I don't know.
[3903.46 → 3904.56] I don't want to say too much.
[3904.72 → 3905.36] The capable one.
[3905.36 → 3905.82] No yeah.
[3905.96 → 3907.06] No that's different.
[3907.20 → 3908.30] I think we should tackle this separately.
[3908.30 → 3910.64] No I know, but it's another one of those like.
[3910.78 → 3912.06] People think it's the worst thing in the world.
[3912.10 → 3912.20] Right.
[3912.26 → 3912.74] Yeah that's true.
[3912.84 → 3913.66] And it's not really that big of a deal.
[3913.68 → 3914.16] It's not really that big of a deal.
[3914.40 → 3916.22] John had another interesting idea.
[3916.34 → 3917.88] Which I don't know if there's enough interest in.
[3918.60 → 3921.10] But with the thing that I was recently checking out.
[3921.10 → 3921.94] That's all I'm going to say.
[3923.62 → 3925.20] I actually don't know what he's talking about either.
[3925.30 → 3926.56] So you guys are on the same page as me.
[3927.10 → 3929.16] Motherboard orientation cooling efficiency.
[3929.76 → 3930.26] That's a good one.
[3930.26 → 3931.18] Like those Silverstone ones.
[3931.18 → 3931.38] Yeah.
[3931.38 → 3933.42] Where it's like up and the IO goes out.
[3933.42 → 3933.66] Yeah.
[3933.78 → 3935.42] Like how well does it cool different things.
[3935.52 → 3936.42] Compared to it being rotated.
[3936.44 → 3937.38] Used to be a bigger deal.
[3937.48 → 3939.32] Back in the earlier days of heat pipes.
[3939.64 → 3942.30] They were only really effective in a certain direction.
[3942.86 → 3946.60] So inverted motherboards would have issues.
[3946.60 → 3947.98] Where if you mounted the heat.
[3948.26 → 3949.78] If you mounted the cooler wrong.
[3949.78 → 3953.56] The liquid wouldn't condense properly.
[3953.56 → 3954.50] Down to the hottest.
[3954.70 → 3956.34] Down to the CPU part of the heat sink.
[3956.42 → 3958.48] And then it wouldn't actually cycle properly.
[3958.62 → 3960.18] But it's not really a concern anymore.
[3960.70 → 3963.14] I wanted to jump back to the things don't.
[3963.30 → 3963.52] You know.
[3963.84 → 3966.72] A cooling medium doesn't get instantly hot.
[3966.78 → 3968.78] After it touches something in the loop that's warm.
[3969.18 → 3970.24] People who freak out.
[3970.24 → 3972.64] If you've got your CPU and then your GPU.
[3973.00 → 3974.76] In series in a water cooling loop.
[3975.18 → 3977.68] The difference between the temperature of the water.
[3977.68 → 3979.04] You're at the hottest point in a loop.
[3979.16 → 3980.32] And the coldest point in the loop.
[3980.72 → 3983.66] Is except in very extreme situations.
[3983.66 → 3984.92] With very low airflow.
[3985.20 → 3985.68] Or excuse me.
[3985.72 → 3986.56] Very low water flow.
[3987.12 → 3990.62] Probably in the neighbourhood of about 0.1 to 0.2 degrees.
[3991.30 → 3991.70] Seriously.
[3992.54 → 3993.36] It's a thing.
[3993.46 → 3996.10] Unless you're running like quarter inch tubing.
[3996.10 → 3999.70] On a pump that you like found in your you know grandma's.
[3999.70 → 4001.34] That place where you got all your stuff for scrap hearts.
[4001.44 → 4001.74] Yeah.
[4002.20 → 4004.24] Unless you found it in a back alley somewhere.
[4006.10 → 4007.14] So no.
[4007.26 → 4009.22] The system reaches pretty much equilibrium.
[4009.44 → 4010.16] This is a fluid.
[4010.30 → 4011.88] This is flowing extremely quickly.
[4011.88 → 4012.30] Really quickly.
[4012.30 → 4012.54] It's not.
[4012.62 → 4012.80] Yeah.
[4013.00 → 4013.18] Yeah.
[4013.22 → 4015.10] A lot of the channels are like really narrow.
[4015.34 → 4015.54] Yeah.
[4016.38 → 4018.08] It goes really, really fast.
[4018.08 → 4022.02] Water does more than just cool by convection.
[4022.02 → 4023.94] When it's running around in a loop like that.
[4023.94 → 4027.84] Like water can conduct heat within itself as well.
[4028.04 → 4030.56] Like it spreads really quickly.
[4030.72 → 4031.48] It's kind of amazing.
[4032.18 → 4032.80] All right.
[4032.86 → 4033.46] So what else we got?
[4033.58 → 4036.62] AC mechanical engineer can confirm in chat.
[4036.78 → 4037.02] Boom.
[4037.70 → 4038.12] Thank you.
[4039.18 → 4039.98] Thank you.
[4042.20 → 4042.82] You know.
[4042.96 → 4045.96] It's hilarious because the fact that he's backing me up on this.
[4046.02 → 4047.16] Means that I'm going, thank you.
[4047.52 → 4050.16] But 98% of the time when someone's like.
[4050.28 → 4052.32] I'm actually a mechanical engineer.
[4052.52 → 4052.74] And blah.
[4052.74 → 4054.48] It's, probably.
[4054.48 → 4056.34] It's probably nonsense on the internet.
[4056.66 → 4056.88] Yeah.
[4056.88 → 4057.74] Because everyone.
[4057.94 → 4059.80] Like as soon as we start doing whole room water cooling.
[4060.00 → 4061.34] Our entire audience is plumbers.
[4062.10 → 4063.36] So many plumbers.
[4063.48 → 4064.36] Apparently watch us.
[4065.04 → 4065.86] And my favourite part was.
[4065.96 → 4066.08] Okay.
[4066.18 → 4068.06] There was definitely some information in there.
[4068.14 → 4068.64] There was some.
[4068.78 → 4069.04] Okay.
[4069.14 → 4070.08] We probably should have done that.
[4070.12 → 4070.92] There was some great information.
[4071.24 → 4073.68] There was also a ton of people claiming to be experts.
[4073.90 → 4076.08] That had no idea what they were saying.
[4076.90 → 4077.70] And yes.
[4077.82 → 4079.46] We know we screwed up whole room.
[4079.70 → 4079.74] Oh yeah.
[4079.74 → 4080.02] Oh yeah.
[4080.02 → 4081.20] It was a disaster.
[4081.52 → 4081.78] Oh yeah.
[4081.86 → 4086.06] But not for the reasons that most people think it was a disaster.
[4086.34 → 4089.02] Like there was a lot of stuff that we did that was fine.
[4089.58 → 4091.40] And a lot of stuff we did that was super not okay.
[4091.86 → 4091.96] Yeah.
[4092.60 → 4094.28] Speaking of super not okay.
[4094.40 → 4095.06] Or maybe fine.
[4095.20 → 4095.36] Geez.
[4095.42 → 4095.70] I don't know.
[4095.70 → 4098.22] I am dark Joshi posted this on the forum.
[4098.32 → 4100.74] The original post here is from f.org.
[4101.38 → 4105.00] Your printer could be spying on you.
[4105.26 → 4107.70] Which it sounds more ominous than it probably is.
[4107.78 → 4109.80] Because the way that they're using this technology.
[4110.46 → 4111.14] At least we think.
[4111.42 → 4114.88] I mean at least we would have no reason to think they would be using it in any other way.
[4115.02 → 4117.44] Is to track counterfeiting.
[4117.44 → 4117.56] Okay.
[4117.86 → 4123.86] So now that affordable high quality printers are so affordable and high quality.
[4124.04 → 4125.20] I want to jump in here real quick.
[4125.48 → 4125.94] Ant Venom.
[4126.06 → 4126.84] He's in the chat right now.
[4126.90 → 4128.40] Remember how he did the basement water cooling thing?
[4128.44 → 4129.62] Still running perfectly.
[4130.04 → 4133.16] Because he did it right by not using a steel reservoir.
[4133.70 → 4135.22] I thought stainless would be fine.
[4135.26 → 4135.74] I was wrong.
[4136.16 → 4136.60] Twice.
[4137.56 → 4140.30] I thought anti-corrosive agents would make it okay.
[4140.62 → 4141.40] I was wrong.
[4142.10 → 4142.54] Twice.
[4142.54 → 4143.54] Okay.
[4145.90 → 4151.50] So basically right here you've got a list of the printers that do or do not display tracking dots.
[4151.64 → 4153.56] But the summary of this is basically.
[4154.62 → 4159.86] And this goes back like way to when like Xerox invented the laser printer.
[4160.48 → 4164.82] What they do is they actually use scattered pale yellow dots.
[4165.06 → 4167.28] All over the document that they printed.
[4167.28 → 4170.06] To give the serial number of the machine.
[4170.30 → 4172.28] As well as I think there's some other information as well.
[4173.20 → 4173.56] The number.
[4173.82 → 4174.10] Yeah.
[4174.28 → 4177.84] So Xerox rep says they put the number of each machine coded into the yellow dots.
[4178.30 → 4181.00] The dots cover less than a thousandth of a page.
[4181.10 → 4183.12] And they can't be seen by the naked eye.
[4183.22 → 4185.36] Because it's usually yellow on white.
[4185.54 → 4187.52] So what you have to do is you have to print a page.
[4187.68 → 4189.28] And use a blue LED flashlight.
[4189.68 → 4190.48] And a magnifier.
[4190.86 → 4191.78] To see if they're there.
[4192.14 → 4193.10] And there's pretty much.
[4193.24 → 4193.56] I mean.
[4193.90 → 4194.78] Where there's a will there's a way.
[4194.78 → 4197.38] But there's pretty much no way to block this from happening.
[4197.38 → 4199.48] Because the yellow dots are actually.
[4199.48 → 4200.32] It's something like.
[4201.20 → 4203.34] Twenty thousandth of a second.
[4203.56 → 4203.96] Blah blah blah.
[4204.06 → 4204.42] Before.
[4204.72 → 4207.04] Before the actual printing happens.
[4207.20 → 4208.26] They're like injected.
[4208.88 → 4209.40] So.
[4209.80 → 4210.58] What if you don't fill yellow?
[4212.66 → 4213.74] I don't know.
[4214.06 → 4214.96] Great question.
[4216.72 → 4217.06] Ha.
[4217.72 → 4218.72] I don't know.
[4219.48 → 4221.12] Or like fill it with something else.
[4222.12 → 4222.48] Yeah.
[4222.74 → 4223.56] I don't know.
[4225.44 → 4225.80] So.
[4226.26 → 4226.42] Ha.
[4228.10 → 4228.86] There you go.
[4229.56 → 4229.88] Anyway.
[4230.18 → 4230.58] So.
[4232.32 → 4233.04] Something.
[4233.46 → 4233.58] Wow.
[4233.58 → 4234.08] That's interesting.
[4234.42 → 4235.76] How does that actually help them.
[4236.00 → 4237.42] I guess for counterfeiting stuff.
[4237.52 → 4237.74] Yes.
[4238.12 → 4238.48] So.
[4238.72 → 4240.20] If you get a bunch of counterfeit bills.
[4240.38 → 4241.18] And you're kind of wondering.
[4241.26 → 4241.52] Okay.
[4241.58 → 4242.36] Where'd these come from.
[4242.36 → 4242.70] Where'd these come from.
[4242.78 → 4243.50] You can inspect it.
[4243.54 → 4244.58] Try to see if the yellow dots are there.
[4244.58 → 4244.64] Yeah.
[4244.64 → 4245.76] If you figure out what printer it was from.
[4245.82 → 4247.30] But like having the serial number of the printer.
[4247.40 → 4248.18] Is that really going to help you?
[4248.20 → 4248.40] Yeah.
[4248.44 → 4250.06] That'll tell you what distributor it went through.
[4250.06 → 4251.80] It'll tell you what retailer it was sold through.
[4251.94 → 4252.12] Okay.
[4252.12 → 4253.70] So you could narrow it down to an area.
[4254.00 → 4254.32] Yep.
[4254.38 → 4255.06] So now you can.
[4255.16 → 4255.78] So you know.
[4255.86 → 4257.04] It can tell you when it was sold.
[4257.54 → 4258.94] So you can see a purchase pattern.
[4259.04 → 4259.84] If it was Amazon.
[4260.16 → 4261.50] You could probably have the person's address.
[4261.68 → 4261.90] Yep.
[4261.98 → 4262.22] Yep.
[4262.44 → 4262.70] So there.
[4262.74 → 4262.92] No.
[4263.02 → 4263.16] No.
[4263.20 → 4264.56] It's like a big deal.
[4264.70 → 4264.98] Or even.
[4265.12 → 4266.24] Even a lot of other stores.
[4266.34 → 4268.36] Like there's lots of stores that collect customer profiles.
[4268.42 → 4268.52] I mean.
[4268.54 → 4270.20] I would hope that a counterfeiter would be smart enough.
[4270.30 → 4272.22] Not to fill out the customer satisfaction survey.
[4272.22 → 4272.50] Or whatever.
[4272.54 → 4273.78] I would hope that they weren't.
[4273.80 → 4273.98] Yeah.
[4274.08 → 4274.34] Okay.
[4274.36 → 4275.24] I would hope that they weren't.
[4275.60 → 4276.06] But I would.
[4276.52 → 4276.86] You know.
[4276.86 → 4277.80] I know what you were saying.
[4277.90 → 4277.98] Yeah.
[4278.04 → 4278.28] Yeah.
[4278.28 → 4279.90] I was going to say.
[4279.96 → 4281.22] To restore my faith in humanity.
[4281.42 → 4283.92] Except the fact that the counterfeiters are running out there making fake money.
[4283.96 → 4285.40] Doesn't restore any of my faith in humanity.
[4285.50 → 4286.22] So not really my point.
[4286.30 → 4287.14] You don't want it to happen.
[4287.26 → 4288.86] But you would hope that someone wouldn't be that stupid.
[4289.20 → 4290.24] Someone made a case for you.
[4290.36 → 4292.04] So this was posted by Unlock 21.
[4292.30 → 4292.44] What?
[4293.16 → 4293.96] You were talking about this.
[4294.00 → 4294.54] Just the other week.
[4294.68 → 4295.24] Oh yeah.
[4295.32 → 4296.28] But they didn't know about that.
[4296.30 → 4296.46] Yeah.
[4296.46 → 4296.64] Yeah.
[4296.64 → 4296.86] Yeah.
[4297.24 → 4300.04] So someone actually made a DIY Mac Pro case.
[4300.54 → 4302.66] I was talking to Linus about maybe doing a video.
[4302.66 → 4306.64] Where I went and tried to buy like a bin or garbage can or whatever that looked kind of
[4306.64 → 4307.08] like it.
[4307.46 → 4309.90] And trying to make like the curved top thing.
[4309.96 → 4312.56] All this kind of stuff to make it look like a Mac Pro and building a computer into it.
[4312.80 → 4314.44] And then literally what?
[4314.50 → 4315.58] The next WAN show?
[4315.76 → 4315.98] Yeah.
[4316.36 → 4318.00] It's like hey they made a case.
[4318.64 → 4323.14] Now to be clear you can't put dual Fire Pro cards in or anything like that.
[4323.14 → 4325.54] It holds an SFX power supply and IT motherboard.
[4325.54 → 4329.80] And I think like one 120 mid fan or something like that.
[4330.16 → 4331.02] But yeah.
[4331.34 → 4332.14] Hey there you go.
[4332.16 → 4332.40] That's cool.
[4332.62 → 4334.82] I think we should try and get one for review if we can.
[4334.96 → 4335.40] That'd be fun.
[4335.46 → 4337.02] I'd love to just like to check it out.
[4337.14 → 4338.54] Here maybe I'll make that your problem.
[4338.80 → 4339.48] Oh great.
[4339.96 → 4341.66] Get for review.
[4342.24 → 4344.90] Because it's like only available in like Japan or something.
[4344.90 → 4349.50] So if we send a message, and they ignore it then we won't go too far into that.
[4349.50 → 4350.52] So don't expect it.
[4350.68 → 4350.92] Yeah.
[4351.26 → 4351.96] Don't expect it.
[4351.98 → 4353.42] But I am trying to get that flip phone.
[4354.42 → 4354.70] Nice.
[4354.70 → 4356.86] Actually Brand is trying to get that flip phone for them.
[4356.86 → 4357.44] No way.
[4357.52 → 4360.48] Because they have all the contacts to like to get all the phones.
[4361.06 → 4363.42] So even though it's not a device.
[4363.42 → 4366.80] Are they going to put like a more expensive skin than the actual phone on it?
[4366.82 → 4367.02] No.
[4367.12 → 4369.20] They actually aren't planning to support it.
[4369.28 → 4370.34] They're just like being bros.
[4370.42 → 4370.96] Makes sense.
[4371.06 → 4371.24] Yep.
[4372.24 → 4373.22] They're kind of bros.
[4373.34 → 4375.24] So we're into their baroness.
[4376.92 → 4377.74] Let's see.
[4378.16 → 4378.54] Oh yeah.
[4379.04 → 4382.70] Just Cause 3 suffers from terrible frame rates on the consoles.
[4382.70 → 4385.30] This was posted over at thegamescabin.com.
[4385.30 → 4385.46] Yeah.
[4385.98 → 4387.08] And basically.
[4387.40 → 4387.64] Yeah.
[4387.68 → 4388.58] The headline here is.
[4388.98 → 4389.96] Bloody awful.
[4390.68 → 4393.04] Which I guess pretty much says all you really need to know about it.
[4393.54 → 4394.42] It was a matter of.
[4394.52 → 4394.68] Oh.
[4394.92 → 4395.08] Oh.
[4395.70 → 4396.18] Dang it.
[4396.42 → 4396.82] Womb.
[4396.94 → 4397.46] Womb.
[4397.86 → 4398.82] Did we just take them down?
[4398.94 → 4399.68] I don't think so.
[4399.76 → 4400.06] Because I.
[4400.20 → 4400.34] Yeah.
[4400.40 → 4400.74] There we go.
[4400.74 → 4400.86] Okay.
[4400.86 → 4402.58] So yeah.
[4402.64 → 4403.56] Basically they're saying.
[4403.68 → 4403.94] Yeah.
[4404.02 → 4404.44] You know.
[4404.92 → 4405.64] It's like.
[4406.08 → 4408.14] Especially bad when there's an explosion.
[4409.24 → 4409.72] Yes.
[4411.02 → 4411.28] Yep.
[4411.50 → 4412.62] Lots of effects on screen.
[4412.74 → 4414.66] That is how frame rate dips work.
[4414.84 → 4415.24] Oh crap.
[4415.30 → 4416.88] I just moved the thing around before I tripped it.
[4416.92 → 4417.18] Anyway.
[4417.30 → 4417.40] Okay.
[4417.40 → 4420.70] But the worst part they're actually saying too.
[4421.28 → 4422.02] Is that.
[4422.02 → 4422.34] Load screens.
[4422.34 → 4423.16] Load screens.
[4423.42 → 4423.62] Yeah.
[4423.88 → 4425.46] Anywhere from 30 seconds.
[4426.10 → 4426.54] To.
[4426.88 → 4427.32] What was the.
[4427.44 → 4428.28] Two and a half minutes.
[4428.28 → 4428.42] Yeah.
[4428.42 → 4429.52] Two and a half minutes.
[4429.64 → 4430.30] Two and a half minutes.
[4430.38 → 4430.54] Yeah.
[4430.68 → 4431.70] On the PlayStation 4.
[4432.26 → 4434.32] That's like Borrowing Xbox One level.
[4434.72 → 4435.08] Yeah.
[4435.26 → 4436.26] That is a bummer.
[4437.06 → 4438.78] Apparently though the game's lots of fun.
[4439.30 → 4439.42] So.
[4439.50 → 4439.66] Yeah.
[4439.70 → 4440.36] I've heard perfect things.
[4440.42 → 4442.14] We probably should have done a performance review.
[4442.24 → 4442.66] Probably.
[4443.18 → 4444.48] I didn't even know it came out.
[4445.10 → 4445.46] Yeah.
[4445.46 → 4447.92] I've been so head down working on stuff.
[4448.10 → 4448.32] I didn't.
[4448.52 → 4448.70] Yeah.
[4450.02 → 4450.50] I actually.
[4450.50 → 4451.64] Someone was like yeah it's tons of fun.
[4451.72 → 4452.64] Are you guys making videos?
[4452.78 → 4453.02] I was like.
[4453.42 → 4454.22] Oh crap.
[4454.60 → 4455.34] If it's already out.
[4455.90 → 4456.62] Probably not.
[4456.62 → 4457.30] It's a little late now.
[4457.38 → 4457.62] Yeah.
[4458.24 → 4458.64] Oops.
[4460.32 → 4460.98] Not bad.
[4462.36 → 4462.76] Alright.
[4463.14 → 4464.36] What else we got here.
[4464.36 → 4465.14] What is.
[4465.94 → 4467.18] I guess we've got like 10 minutes left.
[4467.44 → 4467.72] No.
[4467.72 → 4468.00] No.
[4468.14 → 4469.44] I was going to kind of wrap it up actually.
[4469.64 → 4469.86] Alright.
[4470.80 → 4471.20] Book.
[4472.00 → 4472.40] Yeah.
[4472.56 → 4472.94] No.
[4473.14 → 4474.18] I think that was kind of boring, actually.
[4474.46 → 4474.48] Yeah.
[4474.48 → 4475.10] I don't really care.
[4475.10 → 4475.82] There was no.
[4475.90 → 4477.12] There was something else I wanted to do.
[4477.18 → 4477.62] Where is it?
[4478.18 → 4479.24] I'm doing an after party.
[4479.46 → 4479.82] Are you?
[4479.98 → 4480.26] Yeah.
[4480.68 → 4481.04] Alright.
[4481.56 → 4482.34] Can I come?
[4482.54 → 4482.84] Sure.
[4483.32 → 4483.52] I mean.
[4488.36 → 4488.76] Oh.
[4488.94 → 4489.12] Oh.
[4489.36 → 4489.58] Nope.
[4489.66 → 4490.48] Can't talk about that.
[4492.56 → 4492.92] Uh.
[4493.06 → 4493.68] Close beta.
[4495.02 → 4495.42] Donati.
[4495.42 → 4499.06] Donati banned Hideo Kojima from accepting the Metal Gear Award.
[4499.18 → 4499.46] Yeah.
[4499.72 → 4500.90] This was like not cool.
[4500.90 → 4502.02] It's like them.
[4502.02 → 4506.00] It's like they desperately want to be the least popular company on the entire internet.
[4506.32 → 4506.50] Just.
[4507.54 → 4507.94] What?
[4508.14 → 4508.28] Like.
[4508.34 → 4509.40] Or you could not.
[4509.68 → 4511.88] That would be super awesome.
[4512.74 → 4513.18] Um.
[4513.36 → 4515.56] Not allowed to attend tonight's game awards.
[4515.72 → 4515.94] Yep.
[4516.90 → 4517.26] So.
[4517.26 → 4521.10] I don't really have anything to say about that other than that it's Donati being Donati.
[4521.82 → 4522.18] And.
[4522.18 → 4522.58] Oh.
[4522.70 → 4523.34] This is interesting.
[4523.44 → 4524.64] More Just Cause 3 news.
[4524.74 → 4525.34] This is off the.
[4525.34 → 4525.58] Uh.
[4525.58 → 4526.80] Off GeForce.com.
[4527.48 → 4528.68] Just Cause 3.
[4528.68 → 4529.96] Apparently.
[4530.46 → 4531.16] Straight up.
[4531.52 → 4532.08] Not.
[4532.54 → 4533.18] Compatible.
[4533.38 → 4535.20] With multi-GPU solutions.
[4536.44 → 4537.28] In other words.
[4537.40 → 4540.68] A game update would be required for multi-GPU support.
[4541.36 → 4541.50] Whoa.
[4541.50 → 4544.04] This is straight from Andrew Burns from Nvidia.
[4544.88 → 4545.26] Um.
[4545.26 → 4546.04] Which is sort of a.
[4546.04 → 4546.80] Sort of bummer.
[4547.22 → 4547.72] So it's like.
[4548.24 → 4549.78] They couldn't get it right on the consoles.
[4550.12 → 4551.06] Remember that card?
[4551.42 → 4551.94] That like.
[4552.30 → 4552.54] I.
[4552.54 → 4554.00] I laughed when he was like.
[4554.06 → 4554.20] Yeah.
[4554.26 → 4555.56] Nvidia stopped doing this a while ago.
[4555.56 → 4557.70] When they put two GPUs on the same card.
[4557.70 → 4560.28] And charged you twice as much for it?
[4560.38 → 4561.06] There are reasons.
[4561.36 → 4561.48] Yeah.
[4561.50 → 4562.82] But you're running SLI now.
[4562.90 → 4563.36] For VR.
[4564.14 → 4564.52] Yeah.
[4564.62 → 4564.86] Okay.
[4565.68 → 4570.16] I really hope no VR dev is stupid enough to not properly support.
[4570.18 → 4571.30] I don't know if they're going to be able to.
[4571.84 → 4573.50] I think VR SLI is like.
[4573.98 → 4576.56] Rendering the different eye views per card.
[4576.56 → 4576.70] Yeah.
[4576.70 → 4577.00] Yes.
[4577.14 → 4577.34] But.
[4577.98 → 4581.10] But wouldn't that interface with the headset more than the game?
[4581.20 → 4581.66] I don't know.
[4581.70 → 4582.82] Because I really would have thought.
[4582.84 → 4583.36] I'm not sure.
[4583.42 → 4583.98] I don't know how they.
[4583.98 → 4586.10] I would have thought if it was that simple.
[4586.10 → 4588.94] We would have seen perfect scaling with 3D vision.
[4589.52 → 4590.12] With SLI.
[4590.22 → 4591.70] Like I'd have thought if it was as simple as like.
[4591.76 → 4591.84] Yeah.
[4591.86 → 4593.30] I'll just render each eye with one GPU.
[4593.46 → 4593.74] And boom.
[4593.82 → 4594.34] Perfect scaling.
[4594.92 → 4596.62] I don't think it's simple.
[4597.08 → 4600.00] But I'm assuming that it has more to do with the interface.
[4600.10 → 4601.46] Between the graphics cards and the headset.
[4601.84 → 4602.06] Than.
[4602.56 → 4602.92] Oh.
[4602.96 → 4604.00] I believe it's not simple.
[4604.10 → 4605.54] I just think Nvidia is pretty smart.
[4605.64 → 4606.26] And they've been kind of.
[4606.32 → 4609.92] They were beating that 3D vision drum pretty hard for a long time.
[4610.04 → 4610.24] Yeah.
[4610.24 → 4611.48] And if it was like.
[4611.70 → 4613.04] If it was as simple.
[4613.36 → 4613.48] Yeah.
[4613.48 → 4614.98] As GPU 1 renders the right eye.
[4615.06 → 4616.42] GPU 2 renders the left eye.
[4616.52 → 4616.68] Yeah.
[4616.82 → 4618.90] I'd have thought they would have just figured that out back then.
[4618.98 → 4619.08] But.
[4619.42 → 4620.40] I don't know.
[4620.54 → 4620.90] I don't know.
[4620.98 → 4621.92] I am not a driver.
[4622.10 → 4622.48] Like my.
[4622.60 → 4623.06] My VR.
[4623.26 → 4624.32] Or my SLI is off.
[4626.36 → 4627.56] I just don't run it.
[4627.60 → 4628.70] Because there are so many problems.
[4628.90 → 4629.58] And I just don't.
[4630.04 → 4631.70] Basically every single game that I play.
[4632.50 → 4633.02] Even like.
[4633.18 → 4634.56] Even pretty intense games.
[4634.64 → 4636.04] Don't need more than 1.980.
[4636.16 → 4636.30] Yeah.
[4636.30 → 4639.02] I haven't run it since GTX 260.
[4639.68 → 4639.90] Yeah.
[4639.98 → 4640.74] That was the last time I.
[4640.80 → 4641.88] In a daily driver.
[4642.14 → 4642.68] It's off.
[4642.86 → 4642.88] And like.
[4642.88 → 4645.20] We stopped benchmarking SLI.
[4645.30 → 4645.72] Probably what?
[4645.78 → 4646.58] Two and a half years ago.
[4647.12 → 4647.82] Just because.
[4648.28 → 4648.98] It was like.
[4649.06 → 4649.62] You know what?
[4650.48 → 4651.68] There are tons of problems.
[4651.72 → 4652.76] It's hard enough.
[4652.98 → 4654.04] To get a video review.
[4654.20 → 4655.32] A video card review out.
[4655.72 → 4657.86] Without forcing ourselves to suffer.
[4658.14 → 4658.36] Yeah.
[4658.58 → 4659.00] And like.
[4659.00 → 4659.68] Just like.
[4659.82 → 4660.96] Have games not work.
[4661.04 → 4662.06] And not run properly and stuff.
[4662.20 → 4662.60] So I mean.
[4663.28 → 4664.30] It's one of those things.
[4664.54 → 4665.52] Nothing against Nvidia.
[4665.52 → 4667.08] Nothing against AMD.
[4668.20 → 4668.62] I just.
[4668.78 → 4670.14] I run a single graphics card.
[4670.32 → 4671.38] Because frankly.
[4671.64 → 4672.64] There's single GPU solutions.
[4672.72 → 4673.90] That are so powerful now.
[4674.02 → 4674.60] Someone's like.
[4674.68 → 4674.80] Yo.
[4674.88 → 4676.22] Can I have your unused 980 then?
[4676.30 → 4677.40] It's not going to be unused.
[4678.62 → 4679.98] VR SLI from Nvidia.
[4680.10 → 4680.36] Yeah man.
[4680.36 → 4680.74] It's like.
[4680.94 → 4682.36] I'm stoked for that.
[4682.44 → 4684.00] I really hope it works well.
[4684.14 → 4684.68] A thing.
[4684.82 → 4686.24] And I'm going to be playing the crap.
[4686.24 → 4687.08] Out of VR games.
[4687.20 → 4688.04] If Valkyrie is like.
[4688.70 → 4689.10] Okay.
[4689.60 → 4691.18] I almost don't even care that much.
[4691.24 → 4692.02] About any games.
[4692.10 → 4693.40] Outside what CCP is making.
[4694.28 → 4696.14] I haven't talked about this a ton on the show.
[4696.28 → 4696.42] Yeah.
[4696.52 → 4698.70] But their disc throwing Iron game.
[4699.24 → 4700.78] Is so much fun.
[4701.44 → 4702.86] Like you would love it.
[4703.00 → 4703.40] No joke.
[4703.54 → 4704.26] You stand.
[4704.38 → 4704.86] You stand.
[4705.06 → 4705.22] It's.
[4705.28 → 4706.62] Have you seen the Iron.
[4706.68 → 4707.60] Where they stand on the platforms.
[4707.72 → 4708.62] And throw discs at each other.
[4708.68 → 4708.78] Yeah.
[4708.78 → 4709.36] And block with shields.
[4709.58 → 4709.72] Yeah.
[4709.72 → 4710.70] It's exactly that.
[4711.24 → 4711.74] And it's like.
[4711.96 → 4713.04] Pretty good tracking.
[4713.60 → 4713.78] Nice.
[4713.78 → 4715.58] Because they use connects for body tracking and stuff.
[4715.66 → 4715.88] Right.
[4715.94 → 4717.52] And like the disc can bounce behind you.
[4717.54 → 4718.18] And you can hear them.
[4718.24 → 4719.18] So you have to like to spin around.
[4719.26 → 4719.76] And block it.
[4719.80 → 4720.38] And then throw.
[4720.50 → 4720.76] And like.
[4721.04 → 4722.00] It's really active.
[4722.14 → 4722.66] Tons of fun.
[4722.72 → 4723.44] I played against Colton.
[4723.52 → 4724.54] Just wrecked him.
[4725.02 → 4727.36] It would be fun to have a more athletic opponent.
[4728.36 → 4729.20] Sorry Colton.
[4729.46 → 4731.80] He admittedly doesn't think he's very good at sports.
[4732.00 → 4732.46] I don't know.
[4732.56 → 4733.24] Sorry buddy.
[4733.76 → 4736.26] But it was like 29 to 4 or something.
[4736.48 → 4736.86] So like.
[4736.94 → 4737.90] I don't know what to say.
[4738.26 → 4738.48] But.
[4738.72 → 4739.66] So much fun.
[4739.76 → 4741.22] And then Valkyrie is super fun.
[4741.30 → 4742.92] And Gun jack is super fun.
[4743.30 → 4744.34] And then like.
[4744.48 → 4746.80] There was some demo of another game there.
[4747.10 → 4747.92] Where you just like.
[4748.08 → 4749.46] Slowly walk up a mountain.
[4750.28 → 4750.66] Okay.
[4750.78 → 4751.68] And look at birds.
[4751.68 → 4752.36] And I'm like.
[4753.70 → 4754.70] That's really cool.
[4754.84 → 4757.14] And I'm sure some people were super enjoy that.
[4757.28 → 4757.70] I definitely.
[4757.88 → 4759.04] There is a market for that.
[4759.48 → 4759.92] For sure.
[4760.04 → 4760.64] It's just not me.
[4760.96 → 4761.26] Right.
[4761.78 → 4762.36] I don't care.
[4762.36 → 4763.38] All right.
[4763.44 → 4765.96] Well I think that's pretty much it for the show for today.
[4766.12 → 4766.46] So I am.
[4766.54 → 4767.68] The last thing I'll do us.
[4767.80 → 4769.26] I will drop this link in here.
[4769.52 → 4771.04] If you haven't already.
[4771.70 → 4773.98] Go watch this video.
[4774.18 → 4775.62] It is finally out on YouTube.
[4775.76 → 4776.38] It was actually.
[4776.66 → 4778.98] I thought it was supposed to be a week earlier.
[4778.98 → 4781.84] We actually totally screwed up our production schedule.
[4781.96 → 4782.98] Thought it was.
[4783.08 → 4784.68] We screwed up our production schedule.
[4785.24 → 4788.00] On the super fun jousting video.
[4788.00 → 4789.60] Where we thought.
[4789.96 → 4790.96] That for.
[4791.28 → 4792.36] Awesome stuff week.
[4792.36 → 4792.98] For YouTube.
[4793.44 → 4795.40] We thought we had to have it done.
[4795.52 → 4796.88] A week earlier than we did.
[4797.26 → 4798.88] So we thought awesome stuff week.
[4799.00 → 4799.86] Was a week earlier than it was.
[4800.02 → 4801.56] So we released it on vessel.
[4802.02 → 4803.80] Timed to come out a week later on YouTube.
[4803.80 → 4804.98] For awesome stuff week.
[4805.14 → 4806.96] But that was actually the following week.
[4807.06 → 4809.06] So we had to do a simultaneous vessel release.
[4809.06 → 4809.98] Of odious lists.
[4809.98 → 4811.70] And then delay.
[4812.28 → 4813.94] The Skagway jousting video.
[4814.10 → 4815.16] By another week.
[4816.52 → 4817.22] Oh yeah.
[4817.34 → 4818.82] I was going to talk more about Zen.
[4818.90 → 4819.92] And some of the stuff that they talked about.
[4820.00 → 4820.12] Right.
[4820.20 → 4821.64] So AM4 motherboards.
[4821.92 → 4824.50] Rumoured to launch as early as March 2016.
[4824.98 → 4825.62] And they're going to be.
[4825.66 → 4825.82] You know.
[4825.86 → 4826.60] DDR4.
[4826.72 → 4827.88] Like fully modernized.
[4828.02 → 4830.52] And it has both CPUs and Apus.
[4831.00 → 4831.90] On the platform.
[4832.36 → 4834.26] So if you guys haven't checked it out already.
[4834.26 → 4835.64] I just linked it in the chat.
[4835.76 → 4838.98] But this video is absolutely sick.
[4838.98 → 4840.48] I mean this should give you some idea.
[4840.74 → 4842.38] Of what's in store for you.
[4846.30 → 4846.70] Okay.
[4846.76 → 4847.24] Well that one.
[4847.30 → 4848.18] That one's kind of lame.
[4848.26 → 4849.58] Because it's me versus Terran.
[4850.22 → 4850.48] But.
[4852.30 → 4852.70] Okay.
[4852.80 → 4852.94] Yeah.
[4852.96 → 4853.48] There we go.
[4853.62 → 4854.38] There's a good moment.
[4855.66 → 4857.88] This is like way too much fun.
[4858.12 → 4859.58] And way too dangerous.
[4859.82 → 4862.24] I would not recommend anybody do this.
[4862.64 → 4863.66] I'd love to do it again.
[4863.96 → 4864.16] Yeah.
[4864.18 → 4864.54] Me too.
[4868.98 → 4871.46] So.
[4871.46 → 4871.54] So.
[4872.22 → 4872.66] Yeah.
[4872.82 → 4873.80] You guys are going to want to.
[4873.80 → 4874.70] You guys are going to want to.
[4874.70 → 4875.46] Check that out.
[4875.86 → 4877.30] I'll post the link one more time.
[4877.40 → 4879.16] If you are not subscribed to channel Super Fun.
[4879.24 → 4879.80] Holy crap.
[4879.94 → 4881.16] Get subscribed you guys.
[4881.50 → 4882.44] And share it.
[4882.52 → 4885.36] We can't figure out why more people aren't watching these bloody videos.
[4885.38 → 4886.14] I actually don't understand.
[4886.58 → 4887.36] I don't get it.
[4887.90 → 4888.26] Alright.
[4888.88 → 4889.96] So thanks guys.
[4890.04 → 4891.06] We'll see you again next week.
[4891.16 → 4892.02] Same bat time.
[4892.22 → 4893.74] Same bat channel.
[4893.74 → 4894.24] Bye.
[4894.70 → 4895.78] There's a channel.
[4896.18 → 4898.58] That has like 25,000 subscribers.
[4898.94 → 4899.86] That did a.
[4900.18 → 4902.38] Medieval weapons fighting on Spud ways video.
[4902.70 → 4903.76] I found it on YouTube somehow.
[4904.50 → 4904.90] Um.
[4905.02 → 4906.42] They don't even put two armour on.
[4906.64 → 4907.94] They have like the worst.
[4908.16 → 4908.94] Golden swords ever.
[4909.10 → 4909.88] They'll just stand around.
[4910.04 → 4911.32] Ha ha ha.
[4911.74 → 4913.92] And it has like two armour.
[4914.46 → 4916.82] And are like super sick.
[4916.96 → 4917.86] Crazy tracking value.
[4918.08 → 4918.78] Wearing two armour.
[4918.98 → 4919.78] And slamming each other.
[4920.12 → 4920.48] Oh.
[4920.48 → 4923.08] Oh.
[4923.08 → 4923.12] Oh.
[4923.12 → 4923.16] Oh.
[4923.16 → 4923.48] Oh.
[4923.48 → 4923.58] Oh.
[4925.80 → 4926.16] Oh.
[4926.16 → 4927.30] Are we doing an after party?
[4928.42 → 4929.52] I was kind of just going to go home.
[4929.76 → 4929.98] Okay.
[4930.06 → 4931.26] I'm going to go home and do my after party.
[4931.36 → 4931.58] Okay.
[4931.68 → 4932.28] Good night guys.
[4932.32 → 4932.60] Bye.
