[0.00 → 21.00] Welcome to the WEN SHOOOOOOO
[21.00 → 29.00] Alright, so if we rip the headphone users right at the beginning of the show then it won't be a surprise when we do it again later
[29.00 → 35.00] That's right kids adjust your volume now because this show is going to be loud and proud and
[35.00 → 43.00] and sound plowed
[43.00 → 47.00] No, that's the after party
[47.00 → 51.00] Alright guys, so we've got a bunch of great topics for you today
[51.00 → 55.00] But we're not gonna call out any of those because Luke picked the topic callouts today
[55.00 → 57.00] What a dick!
[57.00 → 59.00] Most of them are crap
[59.00 → 61.00] Wait, is that a swear word?
[61.00 → 63.00] Crap? No
[63.00 → 65.00] Dick
[65.00 → 67.00] Unless you're still alive then it's more of a peach
[67.00 → 71.00] Depending on your skin tone it could be darker
[71.00 → 77.00] Alright, so Steam... Steam back remover is a fraud! Obviously!
[77.00 → 81.00] Geohot built a self-driving car in his garage
[81.00 → 84.00] The Pentagon is interested in weaponized AI
[84.00 → 85.00] Wow! Really?
[85.00 → 87.00] Great idea!
[87.00 → 89.00] Haven't talked to Elon
[89.00 → 92.00] Drone owners must register with the FAA
[92.00 → 94.00] The worst part is they probably have talked to Mr. Musk
[94.00 → 98.00] And yet with all of his charisma and intelligence
[98.00 → 102.00] He was probably all like this is a terrible idea because look at all the raining destruction it can bring
[102.00 → 104.00] And they were like...
[104.00 → 106.00] Okay! We want that!
[106.00 → 110.00] Alright, so let's roll the intro!
[110.00 → 111.00] Pew pew
[111.00 → 112.00] And get on with the show!
[112.00 → 118.00] Pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew
[118.00 → 134.84] Rob Japanese voice wrote
[136.96 → 139.26] Oh. Drone makes.
[139.26 → 144.70] You little cut.
[145.96 → 146.68] Get smarter!
[146.68 → 151.86] my post on Instagram slash Twitter slash Facebook. I guess it goes everywhere. Okay. My post on social
[151.86 → 158.42] media where I had talked about that we had a bit of a, a bit of a data loss situation this week,
[158.42 → 164.92] but we're going to have a vlog coming up about the journey that that has been. So I suspect that's
[164.92 → 170.16] not like the right file. Like I suspect that's like, yeah, there was one that didn't have music.
[170.26 → 174.30] Yeah. So, so anyway, well, we'll get, we'll get more into that. Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[174.30 → 177.98] I'm going to fix it now though. Oh, you don't have the right file though.
[178.40 → 183.64] Well, I wasn't going to totally fix it. I was going to fix it like a little, um,
[184.90 → 191.28] also I don't see, uh, I don't see, I don't see, uh, I don't see a thing right now. Hold on a second.
[191.64 → 196.48] Hold on. Oh, are we still moving? What? Yeah, we're still moving. Okay. That's good. Oh,
[196.56 → 201.26] there it goes. Okay. Okay. We had a bit of a we had a bit of a hiccup there in X split.
[201.26 → 209.08] There we go. I was trying to move this and then this and then there we go so that it would work when we do the outro.
[209.38 → 214.12] Oh, but without music. Yeah, we still won't have audio. No, I, I, what do you think? I'm some kind of magician.
[214.40 → 219.16] Okay. And I can fix the audio too. I can just conjure up audio. Do you know what song it is?
[219.16 → 225.78] We can just hardcore do that. Or if you know what song it is, you could just like find it and then play it.
[225.78 → 225.88] Oh, yeah.
[226.60 → 229.66] At the same time. I don't even know. I think it's an adhesive wombat.
[230.50 → 232.58] So it should be possible to find on the internet. Yeah.
[232.92 → 236.86] All right. So, uh, let's get into, let's get into our first topic of the day.
[236.88 → 241.28] Someone said RIP Cannock server. And I really thought they said Wank server. And I was like,
[241.32 → 242.44] we actually don't have one of those.
[242.44 → 247.44] And if we did, you could bet that one would be backed up in many, many places.
[247.80 → 252.14] That server would come into the room. I'd be like, back that junk up.
[254.82 → 260.14] Oh, that sounds terrible. Okay. So, uh, drone owners must register. Get off Twitch chat.
[260.38 → 261.08] What? What? What? What?
[261.08 → 261.84] Get off Twitch chat.
[262.00 → 262.14] Oh.
[264.14 → 267.64] So, sorry to, okay. No, we're not doing a topic yet.
[267.66 → 268.48] I was so confused at first.
[268.48 → 271.04] No, we have very, a very important announcement to make.
[271.04 → 274.16] Um, it's just taking a little while to change scenes.
[274.24 → 275.74] I don't know what windows updated.
[275.92 → 278.18] And apparently the as far as I can tell,
[278.22 → 281.72] the only thing they updated was the safely removed hardware icon.
[282.02 → 284.00] So I wish it just, I wish it just wouldn't.
[284.04 → 287.30] I wish that this machine would just not change from week to week.
[287.36 → 289.18] That'd be super, super amazing.
[289.70 → 293.74] Um, so I apologize to Twitch chat and Twitter,
[293.74 → 299.00] but I am actually, I'm actually on social media blackout right now.
[299.08 → 299.22] No.
[299.22 → 303.28] Because I am seeing Star Wars, the force, whatever it's called,
[303.38 → 305.28] in about 18 hours in the morning.
[305.96 → 309.66] And I am determined to not know anything about it.
[309.66 → 312.70] I'm going to be doing my after party stream thing tonight.
[312.84 → 314.28] So I'm going to end up looking at Twitch chat.
[314.56 → 318.88] And I have my theory as to Star Wars spoilers.
[319.12 → 322.04] So I think I'm just going to, I'll monitor Twitch chat and it'll be fine.
[322.18 → 322.44] Okay.
[322.44 → 324.64] Are we going to talk about the theories for Star Wars spoilers?
[324.64 → 324.96] Yeah.
[325.08 → 325.28] Yeah.
[325.38 → 327.80] So here, why don't we, why don't we do that as our, as our first topic?
[327.92 → 333.42] So, um, so Luke was asking me right before the show started, like, Hey, um, you know,
[333.42 → 335.38] are you going to look at Twitch chat today?
[335.48 → 336.14] Star Wars spoilers.
[336.14 → 337.34] And I was like, no, no, no.
[337.40 → 341.48] And actually I don't want to talk about this because I did get one spoiler,
[341.48 → 347.92] but like, I kind of like immediately put on a show really loud.
[348.04 → 351.52] I literally think the bot just banned like 80 people.
[352.38 → 355.94] So I, oh yeah, guys do not post them anyway.
[356.16 → 359.44] I think Ghost might've gotten his hands on.
[360.34 → 362.06] Oh no, I, I talked to him.
[362.18 → 362.56] Okay.
[362.68 → 362.92] Oh yeah.
[362.92 → 363.74] That's, that's a thing.
[363.84 → 365.92] Do not post Star Wars spoilers in our Twitch chat.
[365.92 → 367.06] There's probably over a hundred people banned.
[367.10 → 367.30] Good.
[367.30 → 368.32] In the last like two minutes.
[368.34 → 371.38] Do not post Star Wars spoilers.
[371.68 → 372.36] Not even spoilers.
[372.56 → 374.30] Don't post anything related to it.
[374.32 → 376.36] Don't post anything related to Star Wars.
[376.58 → 379.08] Not even, not even Greed shot last.
[379.08 → 379.50] Oh my God.
[379.50 → 380.70] Han shot first.
[380.80 → 381.30] I don't care.
[381.50 → 385.92] Like the bot might get global banned for like spam because the amount of people it's banning.
[386.00 → 386.88] I'm not even kidding.
[386.98 → 388.20] This is insane.
[389.40 → 389.84] Wow.
[393.94 → 395.48] Oh my God.
[395.94 → 396.24] Okay.
[396.24 → 396.56] Okay.
[396.56 → 399.58] So what you heard anyway about the spoilers that are going around.
[399.70 → 399.80] Yeah.
[399.92 → 405.56] What I heard and what I kind of theorized was that there's going to be a lot of people who
[405.56 → 413.06] are going to be spreading spoilers, which aren't actually spoilers because they don't know if
[413.06 → 413.94] it happened or not.
[414.26 → 418.54] So these are people that haven't gone to go see the movie yet and are spamming online about
[418.54 → 423.96] things that they're saying happened to ruin it for you so that you get all Missy because
[423.96 → 426.22] they're trolls, even though they don't actually know it.
[426.22 → 432.62] Because that's the thing about trolls is, is trolls, trolls, like they troll each other.
[432.62 → 439.00] So what would be the first thing that I would do when I got out of a theatre as a, I consider
[439.00 → 445.70] myself a fairly grade A troll is I would go and tell any trolls that I know some misinformation
[445.70 → 448.02] so that they go and spread that.
[448.02 → 450.78] And then I'll be like, ha ha.
[451.28 → 453.56] And that's a ancient reference.
[453.80 → 454.12] Yes.
[454.48 → 455.18] You got it.
[455.18 → 457.06] So, so yeah.
[457.20 → 463.88] So, so my, my theory, so A, I actually, to, to a much greater degree than probably most
[463.88 → 469.84] people, I, I isolate myself from information about movies that I'm really excited about
[469.84 → 470.16] seeing.
[470.46 → 477.24] So I let myself see the first Star Wars trailer, but there was another trailer.
[477.24 → 482.64] There was the Japanese trailer that had like more footage and there's all the interviews
[482.64 → 484.38] with the cast, all that stuff.
[484.56 → 487.00] I have not touched any of it.
[487.22 → 489.12] I watched the first trailer once.
[489.60 → 490.28] That's it.
[490.52 → 496.40] I'm going to go in completely blind, like a new baby sliding out of the womb and, or being
[496.40 → 497.22] pushed out rather.
[497.90 → 498.66] Sliding out.
[498.82 → 499.06] Woo!
[499.70 → 500.14] Woo!
[501.06 → 502.46] Sliding across the floor.
[504.86 → 507.04] And so that's the way it's going to be.
[507.16 → 510.68] So I, I really, I really work hard to keep myself away from that stuff.
[510.68 → 515.34] So I did hear one thing, but I've already forgotten the name of one of the characters
[515.34 → 518.56] involved because like, I haven't been paying attention to all the names of the characters.
[518.68 → 519.98] I don't know who all the new characters are.
[520.16 → 521.94] I don't know who any of the actors and actresses are.
[522.12 → 524.36] All I know is Carrie Fisher is going to be there.
[524.70 → 526.08] Mark Hamill is going to be there.
[526.44 → 527.60] And you were there.
[528.12 → 529.42] And you were there.
[529.90 → 530.92] And you were there.
[530.94 → 532.36] And that's another ancient reference.
[532.36 → 535.36] And that, that's all I care about.
[535.66 → 541.98] Although if, if, if my man Harrison Ford shows up the same way that he showed up for Kingdom
[541.98 → 543.94] of a Crystal Skull, I really don't know.
[544.36 → 547.16] And it's, it's been like another four or five years since then too.
[547.42 → 550.66] Like he was really looking old in Kingdom of a Crystal Skull.
[551.26 → 555.82] So hopefully he's like, hopefully he's like an advisor on the council or some crap.
[555.82 → 561.84] All he has to do is sit in a chair and like, or like sit in a bar and fire a blaster from
[561.84 → 562.82] under a table first.
[563.20 → 563.96] Oh, wow.
[564.16 → 567.98] I was going to say some theories, but I'm not going to because I think that.
[568.04 → 568.26] Okay.
[568.36 → 568.84] Go ahead.
[570.28 → 574.70] I don't think he's just advising because the Millennium Falcon is flying in one of the characters.
[574.70 → 575.86] Hold on.
[575.86 → 576.14] Hold on.
[576.18 → 576.38] Hold on.
[576.46 → 576.62] I'm done.
[576.74 → 576.98] You know what?
[577.22 → 577.98] Oh, really?
[578.16 → 578.34] Yeah.
[578.42 → 578.80] That was it?
[578.80 → 579.70] I'm trying to say it fairly faintly.
[579.76 → 580.84] You didn't have any other theories?
[581.22 → 583.48] Well, I do, but I just thought of that one.
[583.48 → 586.00] I think we're going to have Luke's Star Wars Theory Minute here.
[586.00 → 586.50] No, it's fine.
[586.60 → 587.14] No, no, it's fine.
[587.22 → 588.24] I'm going to put my music on.
[588.26 → 589.20] I don't want to do it because that's not fair.
[589.28 → 589.76] No, no, really.
[589.90 → 590.34] No, no, no.
[590.36 → 590.68] It's fine.
[590.74 → 591.02] It's fine.
[591.06 → 591.28] It's fine.
[591.32 → 591.54] It's fine.
[591.60 → 592.12] Just hold on.
[592.16 → 592.60] Just hold on.
[592.74 → 595.32] I'm just, as long as I have some music playing, I won't be able to hear.
[595.32 → 598.56] I don't want to do it because then people are going to grab audio bites and start spreading
[598.56 → 600.12] them around as spoilers.
[600.74 → 601.00] Right.
[601.10 → 605.98] But I mean, because none of this is true anyway, all you'd be doing is actually helping.
[606.20 → 606.56] Okay.
[606.64 → 608.40] So I should make up a bunch of fake stuff.
[608.40 → 613.24] So by trolling, you actually help the people who don't want the movie spoiled.
[613.46 → 619.38] The more we troll the trolls, the better off the good people will be.
[619.60 → 619.90] Okay.
[620.16 → 620.88] So hold on.
[622.30 → 624.70] But I still want no part of it.
[624.76 → 626.78] So I'm making these next level bullshit.
[626.84 → 628.82] I'm cranking this shit up.
[628.82 → 631.56] BB-8 has a very weird movement pattern.
[631.74 → 636.02] You know how the head kind of like floats on top, probably magnetically, and then there's
[636.02 → 638.02] the ball that's rolling around and all that kind of stuff.
[638.26 → 642.66] That weird movement pattern is actually referential back to Jar Banks.
[642.88 → 645.94] The weird movement pattern that Jar Banks had, that is going to destroy.
[646.26 → 647.50] Isn't that just coming through your phone?
[647.76 → 648.42] No, that's not.
[648.84 → 649.42] Yes, it is.
[655.00 → 656.50] It's just playing through your phone.
[656.50 → 658.96] Okay, whatever.
[660.54 → 665.74] Anyway, so I think that they, there's AI now, and they figured out how to download Jar
[665.74 → 669.46] Banks' personality and movement procedures, but then put it into something that moves
[669.46 → 671.64] on a ball, and that's actually what BB-8 is.
[671.96 → 676.76] Also, Millennium Falcon is probably now flown by a wiki, not Han Solo.
[677.00 → 681.46] Rookie, sorry, not Han Solo, because Han Solo, again, is probably too old.
[681.50 → 685.24] So he might have flown it like once or twice in the beginning of the movie, but by the end,
[685.24 → 686.36] it'll be flown by a wiki.
[690.86 → 692.28] Now I just want to finish that song.
[692.34 → 692.90] I love that song.
[693.12 → 699.48] You know what's hilarious is I had never actually listened to Supernova until like months
[699.48 → 702.50] after we'd been using it as our intro song for months.
[702.50 → 708.92] I wasn't going to say, how did you have it playing through the phone and your phone?
[708.92 → 709.72] It was playing through my phone?
[709.80 → 710.88] That's what I was trying to tell you.
[711.18 → 712.06] Oh, I couldn't hear you.
[712.12 → 713.48] I was like, what are you doing?
[713.76 → 714.84] It's obviously not working.
[715.06 → 716.82] But then you were like, what?
[716.94 → 717.72] And I was like, oh, okay.
[717.80 → 719.34] No, I couldn't hear anything.
[720.54 → 721.12] That's weird.
[721.18 → 722.60] It was definitely playing through your phone.
[722.60 → 724.00] That's never happened before.
[724.94 → 725.34] Okay.
[725.50 → 729.72] So why don't we move on to our next sort of real topic here.
[730.14 → 734.24] Ghost, when this show's done, please tell me you've got some statistic for how many people
[734.24 → 734.76] you're banning.
[734.96 → 738.10] There's like three or four bands viewable in chat like all the time.
[738.56 → 739.42] This is insane.
[739.84 → 740.22] Oh, no.
[740.22 → 741.42] All right.
[741.64 → 744.92] So drone owners must register with the FAA.
[745.32 → 745.66] What is it?
[745.74 → 748.06] Federal Aviation Administration, something along those lines.
[748.22 → 751.90] Basically, they take care of the air, except the breathability of it.
[751.92 → 752.98] That should be our tagline.
[753.24 → 754.30] We take care of the air.
[755.64 → 757.82] But you've got to say it a little bit differently.
[758.18 → 761.16] We take care of your air.
[761.40 → 761.64] Yeah.
[761.84 → 762.08] Yeah.
[762.70 → 763.54] Yeah, your air.
[763.64 → 764.64] It's going to be more personal.
[764.64 → 764.84] Yeah.
[765.02 → 770.20] So starting December 21st, and when this first came out, when we first heard that they
[770.20 → 774.34] were going to try and implement drone registration before the end of this year, I think both
[774.34 → 777.98] you and I called BS on it and said there's no way they'll get something turned around
[777.98 → 778.42] that quickly.
[778.90 → 779.20] Yeah.
[779.88 → 781.38] So I was wrong.
[782.62 → 782.80] You know?
[782.92 → 785.66] Wait, wasn't it drone like law?
[786.12 → 786.48] Anyway.
[786.72 → 787.84] Mandatory drone registration.
[788.04 → 790.58] I said there was no way they would get it pushed through by the end of the year.
[790.62 → 792.48] I said something along the lines of, wow, that's optimistic.
[792.82 → 792.98] Yeah.
[793.72 → 794.38] It's done.
[794.38 → 797.16] December 21st, they beat the end of the year by over a week.
[797.16 → 803.14] So basically, in a nutshell, you'll find nuts.
[804.34 → 806.46] Sorry, I'm just waiting for the scene to change.
[806.48 → 807.00] That's not a spoiler.
[808.70 → 812.62] Windows is kind of in its own little world right now.
[812.84 → 813.50] It'll happen.
[813.68 → 814.14] It's fine.
[814.38 → 814.58] Woo!
[815.06 → 815.34] Yeah!
[815.54 → 816.34] I love this scene!
[816.34 → 823.42] If you register on the December 21st, so soon, up until January 20th, it's free registration.
[823.66 → 825.78] If you register after that, it's only five bucks.
[826.10 → 827.64] So it's actually really not that big of a deal.
[827.90 → 832.24] It only applies to, I'm going to say larger drones, but it's anything that isn't micro.
[832.24 → 833.08] Over half a pound.
[833.24 → 833.40] Yeah.
[833.60 → 833.80] Yeah.
[833.88 → 837.44] Over half a pound, which is fairly reasonable, actually, because it leaves a lot of those
[837.44 → 841.22] foam toy ones, like the indoor flyers.
[841.22 → 843.00] And the little tiny ones and stuff.
[843.10 → 845.50] You don't have to go through, and five bucks register all of those.
[845.54 → 846.16] It leaves that out, which is nice.
[846.16 → 851.14] But if you buy a DJI for a bunch of money, the five dollar registration probably isn't
[851.14 → 852.18] that huge on top of it.
[852.40 → 855.76] But this is something that I see as a big problem.
[856.32 → 859.60] And I said that they wouldn't be able to roll this out in time, or I didn't think they'd
[859.60 → 860.54] be able to roll this out in time.
[860.54 → 867.38] And I'm actually only sort of wrong, because for professional use, the drone registry is
[867.38 → 877.80] actually, for business purposes, unless the FAA has granted a special exemption, they're
[877.80 → 878.96] not set up for it yet.
[879.46 → 885.24] So they're expecting to release rules legalizing business use of drones by mid-2016.
[886.26 → 888.66] And so I'm kind of sitting here going, are you kidding me?
[888.66 → 895.86] What, for six months, unless you go and get a special exemption, you can't use a drone
[895.86 → 897.12] for professional purposes?
[898.52 → 900.88] That, you basically haven't done it on time.
[901.04 → 905.20] That's all you're really saying, is like, yep, we weren't done in time, but we're just
[905.20 → 909.88] going to push this through, and we're going to understand, I guess, that people are just
[909.88 → 910.96] going to do it anyway.
[911.60 → 913.18] Like, yeah, dude perfect.
[913.72 → 918.50] They're not going to have aerial footage in their videos, because you banned drones for
[918.50 → 919.44] commercial use.
[919.70 → 920.10] Right.
[921.32 → 922.68] What are you going to do?
[924.80 → 925.42] I don't know.
[925.52 → 930.54] I think, I personally believe drones do need to be regulated in some way.
[930.92 → 935.08] I don't necessarily think a national drone registry is the answer.
[935.32 → 940.34] I mean, you can have a lot of, wow, you can come at this a lot of different ways.
[940.34 → 943.08] You can kind of go, okay, well, you know, drones are dangerous.
[943.80 → 948.00] They have the potential to disrupt, you know, public services.
[948.58 → 950.72] You can make a lot of the same arguments about guns.
[950.94 → 952.42] In Canada, we have a gun registry.
[952.82 → 954.32] Look at how well that worked out for us.
[955.72 → 956.08] Yeah.
[956.64 → 958.20] Made literally no difference at all.
[958.20 → 960.64] So do I think a drone registry is the answer?
[960.74 → 961.52] No, not necessarily.
[962.08 → 965.02] But I do think something had to be done, so I guess they're doing something.
[965.02 → 970.78] I'm sure I'm just ignorant or non-informed in some way, but why does this cost $56 million
[970.78 → 973.18] to operate for five years?
[973.74 → 974.36] Four years.
[975.42 → 975.90] Well.
[977.48 → 982.80] That's more than $10 million to take registration forms for four years?
[982.80 → 983.86] Like, per year?
[985.34 → 985.78] What?
[988.22 → 989.72] I don't know why.
[990.76 → 994.42] I was hoping you were going to be like, oh, of course, it's because of, but no.
[994.42 → 1001.56] I mean, if any of that money goes towards enforcement, then I can see that being very expensive.
[1002.04 → 1002.32] Maybe.
[1003.04 → 1005.68] But you'd think the enforcement would just be like a lookup.
[1006.94 → 1007.34] Yeah.
[1007.36 → 1012.02] Because like if someone brings in a call, like, there's this broken freaking drone in my backyard
[1012.02 → 1013.18] and police show up and take it.
[1013.18 → 1013.44] Okay.
[1013.52 → 1016.10] And they go like, oh, serial number, look it up in the form, done.
[1016.10 → 1017.20] So here's the problem.
[1017.30 → 1022.16] You're coming at this from, like, a database programmer perspective.
[1022.68 → 1023.00] Yes.
[1023.08 → 1025.98] Where this should be very easy because it should just be a database.
[1026.60 → 1026.78] Yeah.
[1027.20 → 1033.48] And basically it should need no one to run it because officers should just go to an online portal
[1033.48 → 1037.72] and enter a serial number, and then they should have the name of whoever owns it.
[1038.00 → 1038.22] Yeah.
[1038.22 → 1044.12] But what you are forgetting is that, so I will play devil's advocate.
[1044.20 → 1045.22] I completely agree with you.
[1045.28 → 1047.06] $56 million is absolutely ridiculous.
[1047.08 → 1048.90] I was hoping you were going to play devil's advocate.
[1048.92 → 1052.32] The American taxpayer should be outraged that it's costing this much to.
[1052.34 → 1053.06] That's way too much money.
[1053.44 → 1057.10] And when you also consider that people have to pay to register the drone, they're actually
[1057.10 → 1058.38] paying a registration fee.
[1058.50 → 1058.76] Yeah.
[1058.92 → 1059.64] That's like, yeah.
[1059.86 → 1063.76] So anyway, the whole world doesn't necessarily work like that.
[1063.76 → 1064.08] Okay.
[1064.28 → 1070.00] Like, you know, Joanna, middle of Hinesville, you know, wherever that has a drone fall in
[1070.00 → 1074.34] her backyard is going to want to call someone and say, you know, hey, this drone fell in
[1074.34 → 1074.90] my backyard.
[1074.90 → 1076.56] It's like a flying saucer.
[1076.60 → 1077.86] I don't know what this is.
[1077.90 → 1081.82] And she's going to want to talk to someone, and they're going to need to talk to someone
[1081.82 → 1083.84] and someone's going to like to have to go out and retrieve it.
[1083.96 → 1085.54] I don't know if that falls on the police.
[1085.54 → 1087.42] I don't know if the FAA gets involved in that.
[1088.00 → 1093.16] So administration of any kind of public service involves dealing with the public, which is
[1093.16 → 1096.02] extremely time-consuming and extremely costly.
[1096.28 → 1103.44] To be fair, in the notes, it says drone registration will cost 56 million to operate.
[1104.14 → 1104.58] Yes.
[1105.30 → 1106.60] But that could be a wording thing.
[1106.68 → 1106.98] Yes.
[1107.10 → 1108.88] By CNET or whoever.
[1109.08 → 1109.26] Yeah.
[1109.42 → 1110.88] So there you go.
[1110.94 → 1111.88] That's my devil's advocate.
[1111.88 → 1115.48] I still think it's outrageous, but that's all I really have to say about that.
[1115.54 → 1117.88] Um, this is interesting.
[1118.02 → 1122.70] So, oh, the original poster for that last one was Aries Krieger on the forum.
[1122.84 → 1127.02] And the original poster for this one is Sam's Var nick.
[1127.44 → 1129.58] $38,350 a day.
[1130.36 → 1130.66] Yeah.
[1131.94 → 1132.38] Hmm.
[1132.44 → 1132.70] Wow.
[1133.96 → 1136.70] I wonder what kind of videos we could make with that kind of budget.
[1136.74 → 1137.68] Holy crap.
[1137.70 → 1139.58] And all the confiscated drones that we have.
[1143.80 → 1144.76] Like, why?
[1144.76 → 1145.16] Why?
[1145.16 → 1146.76] Why does it cost that much?
[1146.88 → 1147.20] I don't know.
[1147.26 → 1147.84] There's no way.
[1147.94 → 1148.36] Servers.
[1148.50 → 1148.94] Servers.
[1149.58 → 1150.58] Main frames.
[1150.98 → 1151.66] Main frames.
[1152.02 → 1152.78] Main frames.
[1155.94 → 1156.88] Oh my God.
[1157.34 → 1159.00] DDoS identity protection.
[1161.60 → 1163.24] Well, no, we're not going to talk about that.
[1163.32 → 1164.50] There'd just be an internal website.
[1165.78 → 1166.86] Like, local network.
[1166.86 → 1171.12] I'm sure all the police stations are networked together, like, on their own thing.
[1171.58 → 1172.40] Probably not.
[1172.74 → 1172.96] Really?
[1173.16 → 1173.34] I don't know.
[1173.34 → 1174.50] Like, internal police websites?
[1174.50 → 1175.14] Remember, too.
[1175.82 → 1179.40] America is basically like, like, 56 countries or whatever.
[1179.52 → 1180.46] However many states there are.
[1180.46 → 1181.18] I can never remember.
[1181.50 → 1183.26] Maybe that's why it's so expensive.
[1184.46 → 1185.60] Actually, you know what?
[1185.68 → 1186.38] That probably is it.
[1186.38 → 1186.90] That could be part of it.
[1186.92 → 1187.72] That's probably it.
[1187.78 → 1188.78] It's probably all of...
[1188.78 → 1188.96] There.
[1189.10 → 1189.30] Okay.
[1189.32 → 1190.00] We figured it out.
[1190.18 → 1194.18] It's probably all the bureaucratic nonsense and basically setting it all up like 50 times.
[1194.32 → 1194.56] Yeah.
[1195.52 → 1196.94] So, actually, I kind of get it now.
[1197.42 → 1200.42] That makes it a lot more clear, actually.
[1200.64 → 1201.56] So, this is interesting.
[1201.74 → 1207.32] EU countries will be able to stop kids under 16 from using social media without permission.
[1207.32 → 1208.12] He figured it out.
[1208.24 → 1208.60] Chill out.
[1209.82 → 1210.06] What?
[1210.12 → 1212.30] Were people all upset that I hadn't figured it out yet?
[1212.66 → 1212.86] No.
[1212.86 → 1213.16] No.
[1213.28 → 1213.80] The states.
[1214.04 → 1214.50] I'm out of states.
[1214.78 → 1214.92] Oh.
[1215.14 → 1215.76] Did I?
[1215.86 → 1216.20] I don't care.
[1216.32 → 1216.94] You said 50.
[1217.14 → 1217.48] Did I?
[1217.70 → 1218.20] Is it 50?
[1220.52 → 1220.88] Apparently.
[1221.72 → 1222.08] Apparently.
[1222.46 → 1223.38] All right, then.
[1224.56 → 1226.18] What about that, like, uh...
[1226.18 → 1226.72] What about that...
[1226.72 → 1227.24] You guys have so many.
[1227.34 → 1227.64] Yeah.
[1227.78 → 1228.68] I mean, we...
[1228.68 → 1229.94] We should consolidate a few.
[1230.02 → 1230.18] Yeah.
[1230.24 → 1231.16] We keep it simple.
[1231.64 → 1232.04] There.
[1232.28 → 1233.40] British Columbia, Alberta.
[1234.28 → 1235.58] Edmonton is a city in Alberta.
[1236.08 → 1237.32] Manitoba, Saskatchewan.
[1238.58 → 1239.78] I did it out of order.
[1239.94 → 1242.64] Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, New Zealand.
[1243.70 → 1245.20] Halifax, which is in New Brunswick.
[1245.36 → 1246.16] Lots of little islands.
[1246.16 → 1248.30] No, it's in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island.
[1249.30 → 1250.52] New West Territories.
[1250.64 → 1251.84] We don't know if that's one or two.
[1251.84 → 1255.10] The Yukon, which has a V in it for some reason.
[1256.64 → 1258.18] Yeah, we keep it really simple.
[1261.18 → 1261.98] Oh, man.
[1262.36 → 1263.26] Oh, man.
[1263.50 → 1264.64] Yeah, that shit...
[1264.64 → 1265.14] It'd be great.
[1265.26 → 1269.20] Someone needs to capture that and just, like, Canadian geography, jiff it.
[1271.12 → 1273.44] Canadian geography in 10 seconds or less.
[1274.02 → 1279.42] Your guys' is too big and too cut up and ours is too big and just not enough people are there, so it doesn't matter.
[1279.72 → 1279.96] Yeah.
[1280.20 → 1281.26] It's like, we don't worry about it.
[1281.30 → 1285.24] It's like, Linus, you forgot about Newfoundland.
[1285.36 → 1287.40] Like, yeah, but there's, like, six people who live there.
[1288.46 → 1291.76] Four of which are probably watching the show and going to complain that I said that.
[1291.82 → 1292.00] Yeah.
[1292.00 → 1294.10] All right.
[1294.46 → 1296.04] So, what are we talking about?
[1296.22 → 1296.38] Right.
[1296.52 → 1303.76] So, this is fascinating because the enforcement of it is where, like, it hits the fan on this one.
[1303.76 → 1320.60] So, each country in the EU gets to decide for itself on a limit between 13 and 16 years old for how old children have to be before they can sign up for social media without parental permission.
[1320.80 → 1327.76] And they are pushing this on the social media networks to figure out how to enforce with stiff penalties.
[1328.08 → 1333.10] Like, we're talking fines of up to 4% of global sales.
[1333.76 → 1335.56] If they fail to comply.
[1336.26 → 1336.90] Wow.
[1337.44 → 1338.08] Wow.
[1338.64 → 1339.52] That's aggressive.
[1339.74 → 1340.94] It just got real.
[1341.34 → 1343.26] I mean, do I disagree?
[1344.22 → 1346.22] No, actually.
[1346.58 → 1349.86] Because there's all these rules that everyone seems to agree on.
[1349.86 → 1356.62] And that's that kids should be, should have their parents' permission to participate in some of this stuff.
[1356.70 → 1362.34] Because there's a lot of stuff out there that they probably shouldn't have access to at 13 years of age.
[1362.34 → 1370.74] And you could argue that something like social media could actually be more detrimental to a kid than, like, a porn website.
[1371.28 → 1372.84] I could easily make that argument.
[1373.10 → 1373.28] Yeah.
[1373.56 → 1376.04] So, and I'm not going to bother because I'm sure.
[1376.04 → 1379.42] I always frame those things like, you could argue because I don't have a kid.
[1379.50 → 1381.70] So, I haven't, like, actually deeply thought through these things.
[1381.74 → 1384.06] But I would be more scared of social media than other stuff.
[1384.06 → 1384.38] Yep.
[1384.50 → 1385.80] I mean, okay.
[1385.94 → 1389.86] There is probably some fairly damaging pornographic material as well.
[1389.86 → 1390.26] Oh, I'm sure.
[1390.26 → 1390.96] Yeah.
[1390.96 → 1396.66] But if we're just talking, like, you know, two people doing a thing.
[1397.32 → 1398.76] Which is the easiest stuff to find.
[1398.98 → 1400.62] Which is the easiest stuff to find.
[1400.62 → 1409.68] And I really don't think that's as big of a deal as some of the really horrible.
[1410.12 → 1417.54] And, like, I hate to use the bullying word because it almost, it sounds less severe than some of the stuff people can go through on social media.
[1417.56 → 1422.58] There's even the small bits where you're, like, trying to give them a positive outlook on life and all this kind of stuff.
[1422.66 → 1425.10] And, like, social media is largely just a tank of hatred.
[1425.88 → 1426.20] Yeah.
[1426.66 → 1429.28] I mean, it really depends on who you surround yourself with on it.
[1429.50 → 1431.12] But that's something I don't think.
[1431.12 → 1431.92] Yeah, but, like, trending stuff, too.
[1432.02 → 1435.48] That I don't think every 13-year-old is savvy enough to have that figured out yet.
[1435.54 → 1438.08] And I think that's why they put these age restrictions in place.
[1438.86 → 1441.10] And you can say, well, I was ready when I was 13.
[1441.10 → 1441.74] And that's great.
[1441.80 → 1443.02] And so was I, actually.
[1443.54 → 1446.22] And my parents recognized that and let me have a computer.
[1447.80 → 1449.64] So, it would have been fine.
[1449.90 → 1450.84] Everything would have been fine.
[1451.78 → 1453.22] My parents were like, you can have a computer.
[1453.22 → 1455.30] But we're going to put it in the middle of, like, everything.
[1455.56 → 1457.40] Yeah, and that's the way I'm going to do it.
[1457.82 → 1459.72] It's like, yeah, you can use the tablet.
[1459.86 → 1460.78] Use it on the couch over there.
[1463.56 → 1466.60] So, the social media services dislike this for obvious reasons.
[1466.66 → 1468.72] It adds a barrier to entry for their platforms.
[1468.72 → 1475.14] And it means that they can't really just kind of go, oh, well, oh, we didn't see.
[1475.96 → 1479.84] You know, she said she was legal, you know.
[1480.34 → 1482.22] So, I showed her all those ads.
[1482.46 → 1486.26] Even though that's, you know, there's legislation that says I can't do that.
[1486.32 → 1487.02] And I did all these things.
[1487.12 → 1490.08] Her current, like, enrolment is that it's an elementary school.
[1490.08 → 1491.28] She had a perfect fake.
[1491.34 → 1491.92] I couldn't tell.
[1494.34 → 1496.98] It's like, yeah, that actually has never held up.
[1497.80 → 1501.80] So, I don't really understand why it's held up thus far in this case.
[1502.14 → 1502.86] So, yep.
[1503.26 → 1504.90] Yeah, let's see how that goes.
[1505.46 → 1510.68] The companies will not be allowed to divulge information that they have received for a particular purpose without the permission of the person concerned.
[1510.68 → 1514.00] So, they're basically just tightening down the laws.
[1514.34 → 1518.64] And honestly, though, as much as I'm kind of going, yeah, well, this seems like a good idea.
[1519.36 → 1521.96] I do also understand it's really not that simple.
[1522.20 → 1524.06] And sometimes she has a perfect fake ID.
[1525.10 → 1526.70] And it's really, really hard to tell.
[1527.44 → 1539.68] So, one potentially very negative thing that I see coming out of this is that in order for these sites to validate that these people are indeed overage.
[1539.68 → 1546.40] overage or that they do indeed have parental permission is that they could become even stricter about you providing proof of who you are.
[1546.96 → 1553.42] Something that, you know, many internet privacy advocates are seriously against.
[1553.94 → 1559.42] When I heard this, I just assumed that, wow, that's really shitty.
[1559.62 → 1567.46] I just assumed that you would need, like, a parent's Twitter account to be, like, email this person and invite them to the program.
[1567.56 → 1568.94] That's the only way that they can join.
[1568.94 → 1569.60] Yeah, too easy.
[1569.84 → 1573.42] Well, I assumed that a parent could define email addresses.
[1574.56 → 1576.10] So, like, don't let this person register.
[1576.24 → 1577.34] They're not old enough or whatever.
[1577.86 → 1578.20] Right.
[1578.92 → 1580.80] But I don't know how you can verify that you own it.
[1580.86 → 1586.92] Maybe you have to, like, click confirm on the other end of the email or something to agree that you're not allowed to have an account.
[1588.14 → 1588.80] But, yeah.
[1588.88 → 1592.12] If it has to be some sort of ID registration, that's actually kind of sketchy.
[1592.12 → 1592.46] Yep.
[1592.66 → 1596.76] So, there's the answer is never that simple.
[1596.76 → 1606.36] And speaking of answer never being that simple, if only getting rid of ISIS was as simple as weaponized AI.
[1607.14 → 1609.80] So, this was posted by Nous Ball in the forum.
[1610.00 → 1614.44] Original article here is from, wow, my eyes are so tired.
[1614.58 → 1616.92] Is it either e-technics or UK business?
[1616.92 → 1617.84] I got e-technics up.
[1617.90 → 1618.26] Here we go.
[1618.38 → 1618.70] Boom.
[1619.14 → 1626.44] The Pentagon wants $15 billion for weaponized AI in 2017.
[1627.18 → 1627.92] $15 billion.
[1628.68 → 1635.60] Mind you, if all the government can do with, what was it, $56 million is manage to create a drone registry,
[1635.68 → 1637.90] I'm actually not worried about them making much progress.
[1637.90 → 1642.66] Also, to be fair, a lot of what it lists in here, who knows what they're actually going to do,
[1642.72 → 1646.70] but a lot of what it lists in here is making the human more effective in combat.
[1646.82 → 1652.88] And they're talking about things like exoskeletons, wearable devices, cooperative systems, smart missiles and stuff.
[1653.22 → 1660.16] What makes me assume that it's not necessarily only that is they're totally doing literally all of those things already.
[1660.16 → 1660.46] Yeah.
[1660.66 → 1665.42] So, I think it's actually very safe to say that that has nothing to do with what they're doing.
[1665.68 → 1666.12] Yeah.
[1666.12 → 1666.94] Because, uh...
[1666.94 → 1668.96] They're definitely doing wearable devices already.
[1669.12 → 1671.16] They already have exoskeletons.
[1671.56 → 1676.10] I'm sure they already have cooperative systems for drones and planes to fly together.
[1676.30 → 1678.84] And they definitely have smart missiles already.
[1678.96 → 1680.78] So, um, so get this.
[1681.04 → 1686.78] We'll work closely with Congress to make weaponized AI program cost-effective, and the work will be classified.
[1687.08 → 1688.06] Of course it will be classified.
[1688.06 → 1692.92] So, whatever they're telling us, they're also telling us the work will be classified.
[1693.36 → 1693.90] Yeah, yeah.
[1694.20 → 1695.08] So, rip.
[1695.92 → 1696.44] Oh, well.
[1696.94 → 1697.34] Yeah.
[1697.34 → 1699.16] I guess that's all we really have to say about that.
[1699.28 → 1700.20] Yeah, because it's classified.
[1700.20 → 1701.36] Because all the rest of it is classified.
[1701.62 → 1701.70] Yeah.
[1701.88 → 1703.46] And we don't know what it is.
[1704.04 → 1704.24] Rip.
[1704.32 → 1705.16] We don't know what it is.
[1705.22 → 1706.42] Well, it's possible.
[1706.54 → 1707.74] We'll never know what it is.
[1707.74 → 1716.40] You know, it is amazing the kind of stuff that gets kept under the rug by the U.S. government.
[1716.50 → 1716.98] Because what is it?
[1717.36 → 1722.96] Well, there's that law where something like 50 years after 75 years or however long it is.
[1722.96 → 1725.10] And, like, crazy stuff comes out of there.
[1725.10 → 1726.00] Records can be opened.
[1726.08 → 1728.30] And, like, I was listening to Sports Talk Radio.
[1728.66 → 1729.34] No secret.
[1729.42 → 1731.80] It's the only thing I listen to in the car.
[1732.36 → 1733.88] And I forget who it is.
[1733.92 → 1737.22] It's some, like, baseball, like, all-time...
[1737.22 → 1741.22] He was betting on...
[1741.74 → 1742.32] No, no.
[1742.42 → 1743.32] Betting on games.
[1743.66 → 1744.24] Something, something.
[1744.36 → 1744.76] What's his name?
[1744.80 → 1745.20] Pete Rose.
[1745.28 → 1745.64] There we go.
[1746.20 → 1752.82] So Pete Rose, after years of public denial, admitted to betting on baseball when he wasn't playing.
[1753.36 → 1756.76] There's evidence to support that he was betting while he was still playing.
[1757.08 → 1762.38] But some of the records for this are sealed by the U.S. government.
[1763.00 → 1764.50] And I'm kind of sitting here going...
[1764.50 → 1765.44] Like, they were talking about this.
[1765.46 → 1768.66] And they're like, yeah, but we won't know until, you know, the records get unsealed.
[1768.74 → 1770.52] I was like, why?
[1770.68 → 1772.30] Why is a baseball player...
[1772.30 → 1773.58] Like, you've got to be kidding me.
[1773.62 → 1774.94] Like, is this a matter of national security?
[1775.28 → 1778.02] Did he hit a ball too hard and hit a freaking UFO out of the sky?
[1778.18 → 1779.78] Like, you've got to be kidding me here.
[1782.10 → 1784.96] So I actually forget why I got on the subject of that.
[1784.96 → 1785.68] It was just...
[1785.68 → 1786.30] It reminded me of that.
[1786.30 → 1788.02] It's funny, the stuff that comes out of there, though.
[1788.14 → 1790.00] Like, ugh, man.
[1790.50 → 1792.94] Some war stuff gets really weird.
[1793.14 → 1795.94] Like, some of the things they were researching, which gets opened up.
[1796.02 → 1798.92] And it's like, what the Frick?
[1799.66 → 1800.26] Like, didn't...
[1800.26 → 1800.84] Oh, yeah.
[1801.02 → 1801.92] No, I'm not going to get into it.
[1802.84 → 1803.48] All right.
[1803.58 → 1806.68] Germany attempting to end hate speech on the internet.
[1807.30 → 1809.68] This was posted by Aries Krieger on the forum.
[1810.80 → 1815.46] And I guess I wish them a lot more luck and success
[1815.46 → 1817.94] than I wish the Pentagon on weaponizing AI.
[1819.38 → 1822.26] But I don't think that's going to do much for either of their efforts.
[1822.26 → 1825.82] One of my favourite two notes on here is unclear how these things will work
[1825.82 → 1828.96] and also unclear what the appeal process will look like.
[1829.02 → 1831.40] So basically, the whole thing is unclear.
[1832.32 → 1834.24] No one understands how it's supposed to happen.
[1834.36 → 1834.90] But yeah.
[1834.90 → 1838.90] Complaints will be examined by special teams inside the companies
[1838.90 → 1843.08] that will decide whether the content violates German laws.
[1843.16 → 1844.86] And this is social media companies.
[1846.20 → 1846.60] Okay.
[1847.10 → 1850.22] So they've got special teams to examine the content.
[1850.82 → 1852.96] A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment.
[1853.14 → 1855.72] Representatives from Facebook, Google, and the German government
[1855.72 → 1859.14] did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CAT.
[1859.14 → 1863.78] And would this mean that Linus Tech Tips would have to have a special team
[1863.78 → 1864.44] for the forum?
[1866.10 → 1866.56] Wow.
[1866.78 → 1867.50] I hope not.
[1868.06 → 1872.90] Because a lot of this kind of sites aren't really going to be able to survive
[1872.90 → 1875.68] if they need actually dedicated members.
[1875.72 → 1877.22] Because here's the thing to consider.
[1877.46 → 1879.86] While we do moderate the public forum,
[1879.98 → 1882.60] we might not necessarily be able to hit it within that time frame.
[1882.64 → 1885.10] And there's nothing that we can really do about private messages
[1885.10 → 1887.72] because we don't monitor them for privacy reasons.
[1887.72 → 1888.92] Yeah.
[1889.70 → 1890.06] So.
[1890.32 → 1891.22] You can report them.
[1891.42 → 1893.26] If you're a forum user, you can report the private message.
[1893.64 → 1895.78] And if you report it, it invites us into the conversation
[1895.78 → 1896.46] and we can see it.
[1896.56 → 1896.82] Yes.
[1896.96 → 1898.00] But outside of that, no.
[1899.54 → 1901.08] So, yeah.
[1901.80 → 1905.20] Well, if the German government calls, I'll just be like,
[1905.36 → 1907.22] Mesa no Speckle Deutsch.
[1907.36 → 1907.82] Thank you.
[1907.86 → 1908.00] Bye.
[1908.92 → 1909.32] So.
[1912.38 → 1914.48] Was that like Jar mixed with?
[1915.32 → 1915.72] Okay.
[1916.22 → 1916.58] Okay.
[1917.72 → 1921.60] No, I don't think I is Mesa in German.
[1923.38 → 1923.94] Jerk.
[1924.00 → 1925.56] I was trying to figure out what you mixed, though,
[1925.60 → 1926.40] and I was like, wait.
[1927.56 → 1928.20] Jar?
[1929.46 → 1931.36] I was trying to think of, like, what language.
[1931.86 → 1932.26] Oh.
[1933.20 → 1933.82] All right.
[1933.82 → 1934.02] Jar.
[1934.32 → 1934.54] Sure.
[1935.14 → 1936.60] So this was posted by Nova.
[1936.76 → 1936.98] Sorry.
[1937.06 → 1938.86] I am so tired this week.
[1938.98 → 1939.84] Geo Hot.
[1939.84 → 1945.70] George Hot has built a self-driving car in his garage.
[1945.80 → 1947.46] Raising the obvious question,
[1948.46 → 1950.40] why was this so complicated?
[1950.80 → 1953.62] Because there's really nothing to crash into in a garage.
[1953.98 → 1955.00] Oh, no.
[1955.00 → 1957.64] And how will he keep from dying?
[1958.88 → 1960.32] Must be very low emissions.
[1961.32 → 1962.70] Well, it could be a vented garage.
[1962.80 → 1964.02] I guess it could be a vented garage.
[1964.10 → 1964.70] Do they have that?
[1964.78 → 1969.88] Like, is that like an anti-suicide, like, feature of houses?
[1970.88 → 1972.36] That would be kind of cool, right?
[1973.34 → 1975.46] Like, if they just made it, like, Canadian law.
[1975.46 → 1978.30] You could have them closed, and, like, the vents closed,
[1978.40 → 1981.32] and then if it detects CO2, the vents could just open.
[1981.68 → 1981.94] Yeah.
[1982.30 → 1983.96] And, like, fans could turn on or something.
[1984.12 → 1987.00] Like, it seems like, like, in our rubber room.
[1987.12 → 1989.00] But no, because they didn't take the car.
[1989.72 → 1991.30] Oh, right, because you sit in the car.
[1991.70 → 1994.62] So, well, excuse me for not knowing, like, the most about.
[1994.70 → 1995.34] I'll try not to.
[1995.90 → 1996.26] Right.
[1996.60 → 1997.48] Oh, yeah, good call.
[1997.62 → 1997.80] Okay.
[1998.68 → 1999.04] So.
[1999.32 → 2000.16] Moving forward.
[2000.76 → 2001.76] He, yeah.
[2001.76 → 2006.96] Anyway, this dude is, like, really smart, but has an interesting personality.
[2007.32 → 2011.18] He was the first person as far as this might, I'm going totally off script here,
[2011.22 → 2015.88] but I think he was the first person to hack the iPhone in order to get it onto carriers that weren't AT&T.
[2016.28 → 2020.64] This is Geohot, very well known on the internet for the hackings of the things.
[2020.96 → 2022.54] That's what his car looks like right now.
[2022.62 → 2023.20] Pretty badass.
[2025.12 → 2029.92] He's worked for a lot of, like, really crazy companies, but not for very long.
[2029.92 → 2030.68] Yeah, he's 26.
[2030.68 → 2044.22] He likes to quit and then move on because he likes to say that he knows everything and is much further than that company and then be like, well, this isn't challenging enough and then move on, which is why he lives in his garage.
[2044.34 → 2047.06] But also why he does super badass stuff like this.
[2047.06 → 2049.52] He had meetings with Elon Musk.
[2049.60 → 2057.18] Elon Musk offered him millions and millions and millions of dollars if his thing was able to beat the one that they're already planning on replacing that's in the Teslas.
[2057.86 → 2061.56] And this guy eventually was like, you changed the terms too much.
[2061.64 → 2062.12] So, nope.
[2062.92 → 2065.04] Elon's email back was literally just, okay.
[2065.04 → 2067.84] So, they were done talking now.
[2068.54 → 2073.02] His self-driving car is largely built around learning.
[2073.58 → 2078.14] So, the prototype will learn from other drivers and right now has been learning from that dude.
[2078.14 → 2083.54] So, if you're going to drive this car, hopefully you think that that dude drives really, really, perfect.
[2085.78 → 2086.54] Perfect.
[2086.54 → 2091.98] But, theoretically, over time it will learn from a large amount of drivers and should be okay.
[2092.88 → 2096.14] My only problem with that is that it totally leaves room for error.
[2097.68 → 2097.98] Yeah.
[2098.28 → 2104.30] All we need to set back self-driving car legislation by a decade or more.
[2104.36 → 2105.10] Bad competition.
[2105.10 → 2108.78] Is a crappy product that isn't ready for prime time.
[2108.88 → 2110.88] I don't think this dude's going to release a crappy product.
[2111.38 → 2114.18] He's actually like really, really, really, really, perfect.
[2114.74 → 2114.80] But.
[2114.94 → 2115.38] But.
[2115.38 → 2116.56] It's still scary.
[2116.96 → 2117.18] Yeah.
[2118.04 → 2118.48] Yeah.
[2118.50 → 2121.08] It grabs data from other drivers and learns from their choices.
[2121.68 → 2123.36] Right now it's learning off of him.
[2123.74 → 2124.84] It's a fascinating setup.
[2125.16 → 2128.24] And he plans on selling it for like surprisingly really cheap.
[2128.32 → 2128.56] Yeah.
[2128.68 → 2132.52] Apparently the cameras that it's using, it's like a kit of about six cameras.
[2132.68 → 2135.26] That would be similar to the kind that you would find in a smartphone.
[2137.32 → 2142.90] So, the plan is to sell camera and software for $1,000 each to automakers or to consumers.
[2142.90 → 2143.68] Yeah.
[2143.76 → 2147.36] So, you could buy this kit and implement it in your own car, which is pretty cool.
[2147.70 → 2147.92] Yeah.
[2148.28 → 2152.62] If you also happen to have the, you know, electronics know-how.
[2152.68 → 2152.86] Yeah.
[2152.94 → 2153.86] To make that happen.
[2154.04 → 2154.14] Yeah.
[2154.14 → 2157.96] So, this next, oh man, this next topic.
[2158.10 → 2159.82] I actually, oh, you know what?
[2159.90 → 2160.10] No.
[2160.22 → 2163.36] Before we get into this next topic, sponsors.
[2163.36 → 2167.94] So, our first sponsor today is FreshBooks.
[2168.00 → 2170.36] The books that keep you fresh.
[2170.66 → 2171.60] You know what's perfect?
[2171.66 → 2174.42] When you go to a bookstore, and you pick up a new book, and it smells perfect.
[2174.88 → 2175.84] Because it smells fresh.
[2175.94 → 2176.56] I'm into that.
[2176.78 → 2177.42] I'm into that.
[2177.64 → 2177.78] Yeah.
[2177.78 → 2179.80] But that's actually nothing to do with FreshBooks.
[2179.80 → 2185.56] So, FreshBooks is a cloud-based accounting software for small businesses that lets them get organized,
[2186.04 → 2193.80] get paid faster, track hours and expenses and all of that without necessarily being a numbers' person.
[2194.60 → 2201.40] So, if you're running a small dance studio, or you're doing massage on the side, or you're doing massage on the back
[2201.40 → 2206.00] or massage on the front or, sorry, I got sidetracked there.
[2206.00 → 2209.74] Yeah, abdominal massage, roll massage, you know?
[2209.86 → 2210.08] Yeah.
[2210.32 → 2212.94] It's like rolling the dough massage.
[2214.10 → 2215.24] Sorry, what are we talking about?
[2215.32 → 2215.46] Right.
[2215.56 → 2218.22] So, you could, rolling the dough, you could be a small-time baker.
[2219.58 → 2222.36] I thought you were going to say rolling the dough by using FreshBooks to invoice all of your customers.
[2222.36 → 2223.36] Oh, that's good too.
[2223.50 → 2225.10] Oh, yeah, I like that one better than mine.
[2225.26 → 2225.70] We didn't screw that.
[2227.98 → 2230.44] So, basically, you can keep track of your hours.
[2230.62 → 2233.38] You can send bills to your clients.
[2233.48 → 2234.62] You can accept deposits.
[2234.62 → 2236.58] You can get paid by your clients.
[2236.70 → 2238.64] You can see when they've seen the invoice so you can be like,
[2239.04 → 2240.38] yo, sup?
[2240.82 → 2242.44] You should probably pay me right about now.
[2242.52 → 2245.98] Although, I wouldn't recommend, you know, going all drug dealer collections on it.
[2246.08 → 2246.40] Yeah, maybe.
[2246.74 → 2247.14] Maybe.
[2247.30 → 2251.38] You still have to actually run your business well, which is exactly the point of this.
[2251.40 → 2253.66] Is you can spend your time running your business, doing your work,
[2253.68 → 2257.28] instead of drinking around with complicated accounting software all the time.
[2257.28 → 2262.58] So, if you want to try it out for free, visit freshbooks.com slash when and claim your free trial

[2270.04 → 2271.14] And you'll be like, when?
[2271.40 → 2272.72] And they'll be like, how?
[2273.92 → 2274.90] And they'll be like, who?
[2275.02 → 2276.20] And you'll be like, when?
[2276.62 → 2277.44] And the what?
[2278.32 → 2278.76] What?
[2278.76 → 2282.66] Speaking of what?
[2283.24 → 2284.10] Speaking of what?
[2284.68 → 2285.66] Sorry, I did a thing.
[2285.76 → 2286.86] I did a thing that was wrong.
[2287.22 → 2287.62] Okay.
[2288.68 → 2289.56] Tunnel bear.
[2292.36 → 2295.78] If you want to do the thing that is wrong in your country.
[2295.78 → 2296.32] You go ahead.
[2296.40 → 2297.06] You do tunnel bear.
[2297.20 → 2298.52] I clearly can't handle this today.
[2298.52 → 2299.44] I'm getting a drink of water.
[2299.44 → 2300.90] If you want to do the thing that is wrong in your country,
[2301.08 → 2303.08] but might be right in someone else's country,
[2303.48 → 2304.58] you could use tunnel bear.
[2304.78 → 2308.16] Or if you just want to cover up your tracks or do whatever,
[2308.16 → 2309.28] I don't know.
[2309.44 → 2310.08] It's a VPN.
[2310.38 → 2312.94] It's free if you use 500 megabytes of data in one month.
[2312.94 → 2314.82] What are you advising people on how to do?
[2315.20 → 2316.24] I'm just, I don't know.
[2316.58 → 2317.78] I'm leaving it up to them.
[2318.00 → 2319.40] People can do whatever they want.
[2320.04 → 2321.10] That's what tunnel bear is about.
[2321.38 → 2322.92] You can hide yourself behind a bear.
[2323.68 → 2324.24] It's pretty cool.
[2324.30 → 2325.78] I actually love the tunnel bear, like,
[2326.28 → 2327.28] naming scheme and pictures.
[2327.28 → 2328.60] And I actually use it all the time now.
[2328.68 → 2330.36] I'm not even just saying that because it's a sponsor spot.
[2330.64 → 2333.08] It's running on my work computer literally this second.
[2333.54 → 2334.88] And it's a nice little wooden dashboard.
[2335.02 → 2336.38] I like the cliquey sound that the button makes.
[2336.48 → 2336.70] Whatever.
[2336.82 → 2337.48] None of that's important.
[2337.48 → 2340.28] They have apps for iOS, Android, PC, and Mac,
[2340.34 → 2341.44] and also a Chrome extension.
[2341.60 → 2343.70] I just use the Windows app, not the Chrome extension,
[2343.84 → 2344.22] but whatever.
[2345.14 → 2347.94] It lets you tunnel to up to 16 different countries.
[2348.88 → 2351.18] And one thing that I like is they also have just
[2351.18 → 2353.56] what is the closest tunnel as an option,
[2353.96 → 2355.06] which is actually pretty cool.
[2355.20 → 2358.22] If you're not currently worried about getting outside
[2358.22 → 2360.22] of your own country in order to access a service,
[2360.28 → 2361.70] but still want to cover up your tracks,
[2361.74 → 2363.60] whether it's for advertisement targeting reasons
[2363.60 → 2364.40] or other reasons,
[2364.40 → 2365.60] you can just go,
[2365.68 → 2366.62] what's the closest tunnel,
[2366.74 → 2368.06] and then it's probably nice and fast.
[2368.14 → 2371.04] I noticed no perceivable speed difference
[2371.04 → 2373.58] in just browsing and doing other various basic things
[2373.58 → 2374.60] on the computer when doing that.
[2374.66 → 2375.28] So that was cool.
[2376.40 → 2379.14] They fixed the annoying parts of VPN usage
[2379.14 → 2380.10] for personal use.
[2380.18 → 2381.90] There's no need to mess around with port configurations,
[2382.06 → 2383.94] DNS, or other router settings, or whatever.
[2383.94 → 2386.92] You just download the thing, install the thing,
[2387.04 → 2387.82] log into the thing,
[2387.94 → 2389.94] press the knobby button onto on,
[2390.00 → 2391.02] and then it works.
[2391.72 → 2392.52] So yeah.
[2392.52 → 2392.76] Okay.
[2392.76 → 2394.44] If you want to get unlimited data,
[2394.78 → 2396.00] you have to pay for it.
[2396.02 → 2397.32] But you can save 10% by going to
[2397.32 → 2398.52] tunnelbear.com slash LTT.
[2398.52 → 2402.44] And finally, good old Squarespace.
[2403.00 → 2403.82] This is a rectangle.
[2404.00 → 2405.58] You know, the funny thing about...
[2405.58 → 2408.46] Dang it, that is exactly where I was going with that.
[2408.78 → 2409.76] What? Really?
[2409.76 → 2411.28] The funny thing about Squarespace
[2411.28 → 2413.38] is that their sights look great
[2413.38 → 2415.80] regardless of the aspect ratio of your screen.
[2416.22 → 2419.06] That is exactly where I was going with it.
[2419.34 → 2420.76] Oh, none of this is scripted.
[2420.84 → 2421.74] You ruin everything.
[2423.96 → 2424.36] Squarespace.
[2424.84 → 2425.86] Build it beautiful.
[2426.22 → 2426.46] Thank you.
[2426.46 → 2427.66] That was scripted.
[2428.04 → 2430.10] So they've got 24-7 support
[2430.10 → 2432.06] via live chat and email.
[2432.28 → 2433.58] It's only eight bucks a month
[2433.58 → 2434.80] for the management tools
[2434.80 → 2435.86] to manage your website
[2435.86 → 2438.36] as well as your web hosting service.
[2439.24 → 2439.68] And...
[2439.68 → 2441.34] Oh, that's to start with.
[2441.38 → 2443.22] Obviously, they do have more expensive plans.
[2443.40 → 2445.06] Commerce is included with every website.
[2445.40 → 2447.02] And the templates look great
[2447.02 → 2448.30] on any size screen
[2448.30 → 2450.32] regardless of whether you want to build a blog
[2450.32 → 2452.56] or a like, you know,
[2452.64 → 2454.86] informational site about barrels
[2454.86 → 2456.46] or crates
[2456.46 → 2457.88] or five-gallon buckets
[2457.88 → 2459.36] or whatever the case may be.
[2460.92 → 2463.18] And you can start a trial on Squarespace
[2463.18 → 2465.52] with no credit card required
[2465.52 → 2467.98] and start building your website today.

[2473.72 → 2475.88] Squarespace is not just for you.
[2476.86 → 2478.52] Squarespace is for anyone
[2478.52 → 2479.86] who wants to build a website
[2479.86 → 2481.44] and wants it to actually be easy
[2481.44 → 2483.28] and still look not like crap.
[2483.66 → 2484.66] And when I say not like crap,
[2484.72 → 2485.96] I mean they actually look perfect
[2485.96 → 2487.08] as long as you don't
[2487.08 → 2489.40] intentionally find photos of crap
[2489.40 → 2491.16] and upload them to Squarespace.
[2491.30 → 2492.20] You could probably still make it look good.
[2492.38 → 2493.68] You could probably still make it look good
[2493.68 → 2494.14] with Squarespace.
[2494.14 → 2495.86] So there you go, guys.
[2496.20 → 2497.04] Squarespace.com,
[2497.10 → 2497.92] offer code Linus,
[2498.14 → 2499.82] save 10%.
[2499.82 → 2500.36] Squarespace!
[2501.10 → 2501.92] Build it beautiful!
[2504.08 → 2505.88] Someone tweeted them the other day
[2505.88 → 2507.40] and included me in it
[2507.40 → 2507.74] and was like,
[2507.80 → 2508.74] you guys should really get
[2508.74 → 2510.08] a commercial of just Luke
[2510.08 → 2511.20] running around yelling
[2511.20 → 2512.46] Squarespace build it beautiful
[2512.46 → 2513.34] at random people.
[2513.74 → 2515.16] No, they should not.
[2517.52 → 2518.68] They are so much...
[2518.68 → 2520.12] The problem is people would just be, like,
[2520.18 → 2520.72] scared
[2520.72 → 2521.46] and, like,
[2521.46 → 2522.56] what just happened?
[2522.56 → 2524.90] and they wouldn't get the point at all.
[2525.24 → 2526.70] Just running up to people,
[2527.02 → 2528.42] Squarespace build it beautiful!
[2528.58 → 2529.18] Then running, like,
[2529.26 → 2530.10] no one would get it.
[2530.20 → 2531.10] It wouldn't work well
[2531.10 → 2531.84] as a marketing campaign.
[2531.86 → 2532.88] Okay, well, hold on a second.
[2533.30 → 2533.78] Let's think,
[2533.88 → 2534.54] let's talk about
[2534.54 → 2535.18] what's effective
[2535.18 → 2536.08] as a marketing campaign.
[2536.22 → 2536.94] If you were to,
[2537.04 → 2538.72] if you were to do this to adults,
[2538.72 → 2539.74] I don't think it would be effective,
[2539.86 → 2541.38] but if you were to scream it at children,
[2541.86 → 2544.28] you could actually scar them for life.
[2545.74 → 2546.72] Why is that okay?
[2546.80 → 2547.38] Remember that?
[2547.66 → 2548.74] So, hold on, hold on.
[2548.74 → 2549.64] So you, like,
[2549.72 → 2551.06] paint your teeth red, right?
[2551.26 → 2551.48] Oh my god.
[2551.48 → 2552.16] And you put in, like,
[2552.16 → 2553.52] yellow contacts or whatever.
[2553.88 → 2554.46] So you, like,
[2554.50 → 2555.16] walk up to people
[2555.16 → 2555.88] with your eyes closed.
[2556.38 → 2558.32] So you walk up to people
[2558.32 → 2559.34] with your eyes closed
[2559.34 → 2560.44] and your mouth closed
[2560.44 → 2560.98] or, like,
[2561.02 → 2561.68] these kids, right?
[2561.98 → 2562.38] And you'd be like,
[2562.86 → 2563.38] Squarespace!
[2563.68 → 2563.96] It's beautiful!
[2564.48 → 2565.66] And you scream in their face, right?
[2567.24 → 2568.30] Sorry, did I spit on you?
[2568.56 → 2569.36] It's got all, like,
[2569.36 → 2570.12] the laptop inside.
[2570.12 → 2570.48] My bad.
[2570.66 → 2571.12] It's fine.
[2572.10 → 2573.24] I think that
[2573.24 → 2574.26] they would not only
[2574.26 → 2575.46] remember that forever,
[2575.64 → 2576.16] but they would
[2576.16 → 2576.98] tell their friends.
[2578.48 → 2578.80] Probably.
[2578.80 → 2579.00] Probably.
[2579.32 → 2581.64] It would be a very well-known campaign.
[2581.64 → 2583.36] Yeah, it would be pretty viral,
[2583.52 → 2583.76] I think.
[2583.76 → 2584.58] I don't know if it would be good.
[2584.58 → 2585.40] Viral in, like,
[2585.44 → 2585.56] an
[2585.92 → 2586.94] it's a virus
[2586.94 → 2588.44] type way.
[2588.62 → 2588.78] Yeah.
[2589.26 → 2589.42] Yeah.
[2590.00 → 2590.18] Yeah.
[2590.18 → 2592.52] Wow, some of my
[2592.52 → 2594.26] best slash the worst ideas
[2594.26 → 2595.06] really come when I'm
[2595.06 → 2596.46] super sleep-deprived like this.
[2596.90 → 2598.60] I told you my writing thing, right?
[2599.22 → 2600.30] If I write a script
[2600.30 → 2600.80] at, like,
[2601.00 → 2602.18] four or five in the morning,
[2602.48 → 2603.90] it's considerably better.
[2604.26 → 2605.16] Like, the length,
[2605.42 → 2606.20] it's, like,
[2606.30 → 2607.10] it's, it's,
[2607.10 → 2608.02] it's tight,
[2608.14 → 2608.72] it's packed with
[2608.72 → 2609.44] perfect information,
[2609.58 → 2610.10] it's funny,
[2610.36 → 2611.00] all that kind of stuff,
[2611.08 → 2611.38] and it's,
[2611.50 → 2612.38] I do it really quickly.
[2612.62 → 2613.12] Next, you're gonna,
[2613.12 → 2613.68] I can be done the whole thing
[2613.68 → 2613.84] in, like, an hour.
[2613.84 → 2614.66] Next, you're going to tell me
[2614.66 → 2615.46] that you could do that
[2615.46 → 2616.04] in the afternoon
[2616.04 → 2616.78] if I let you bring
[2616.78 → 2617.98] some reefer into the office.
[2618.22 → 2618.82] Some reefer.
[2619.08 → 2619.78] Oh, my God.
[2620.48 → 2620.84] Apparently,
[2621.02 → 2622.18] this office runs on
[2622.18 → 2623.50] that stuff
[2623.50 → 2624.44] that I'm not going to name.
[2624.82 → 2625.38] The drink.
[2626.32 → 2627.10] Not alcohol.
[2627.66 → 2629.24] The, the, uh, uh.
[2633.24 → 2633.94] What is that?
[2634.02 → 2634.44] I don't even know
[2634.44 → 2634.90] what that is.
[2634.98 → 2635.34] Really?
[2635.82 → 2636.04] Yeah.
[2636.04 → 2636.58] It's that, like,
[2636.70 → 2638.18] insanity energy drink
[2638.18 → 2638.98] that John's been
[2638.98 → 2640.16] totally hyped up on
[2640.16 → 2641.16] over the last, like,
[2641.32 → 2641.92] week and a half.
[2641.94 → 2642.58] Oh, he has?
[2642.62 → 2643.24] And every once in a while,
[2643.32 → 2643.66] he's, like,
[2643.68 → 2644.18] he'll be like,
[2644.36 → 2645.44] I don't feel very good.
[2645.54 → 2645.82] And I was like,
[2645.82 → 2646.40] how much did you have?
[2646.42 → 2646.96] He's like, two.
[2647.12 → 2647.44] I'm like,
[2647.56 → 2648.66] don't do that.
[2650.38 → 2650.70] Oh.
[2650.90 → 2651.68] Is there a reason
[2651.68 → 2652.28] we're not saying
[2652.28 → 2652.86] the name of it?
[2653.10 → 2654.40] Like, are we in negotiations
[2654.40 → 2655.46] with them to be a sponsor
[2655.46 → 2656.08] or something?
[2656.38 → 2656.40] I don't know.
[2656.40 → 2657.38] I just, I just,
[2657.48 → 2658.66] I don't know why we have it.
[2658.76 → 2659.46] I don't know.
[2660.02 → 2660.82] Oh, okay.
[2660.98 → 2661.50] We have, like,
[2661.52 → 2662.10] a lot of it
[2662.10 → 2663.04] for some reason.
[2663.16 → 2663.72] Oh, okay.
[2663.78 → 2664.94] Is this a Colton initiative?
[2665.24 → 2665.52] Yeah.
[2666.20 → 2666.56] Okay.
[2667.42 → 2668.22] Okay, sure.
[2668.34 → 2668.94] Well, whatever.
[2669.30 → 2670.68] Um, okay, right.
[2670.90 → 2671.76] So the reason
[2671.76 → 2673.22] that this next topic
[2673.22 → 2674.06] reminded me
[2674.06 → 2675.40] of our sponsor spot
[2675.40 → 2675.98] for the day
[2675.98 → 2677.22] is that it actually
[2677.22 → 2678.08] involves
[2678.08 → 2679.72] one of our sponsors.
[2679.98 → 2680.14] Yeah.
[2680.46 → 2682.20] Um, not on the show today,
[2682.20 → 2683.30] but, uh,
[2683.30 → 2684.20] Dollar Shave Club
[2684.20 → 2684.98] is actually
[2684.98 → 2685.60] one of our
[2685.60 → 2687.10] the oldest sponsors.
[2687.76 → 2688.40] Um,
[2688.94 → 2690.14] going back,
[2690.20 → 2691.02] they were actually,
[2691.44 → 2692.14] them and Squarespace
[2692.14 → 2692.64] were,
[2692.76 → 2692.98] were,
[2692.98 → 2693.42] I think,
[2693.48 → 2694.50] the first couple
[2694.50 → 2695.64] who were not
[2695.64 → 2696.50] tech companies.
[2696.64 → 2696.86] Yeah.
[2696.92 → 2697.50] Who were just like,
[2697.50 → 2697.74] yeah,
[2697.78 → 2698.66] we think what you guys
[2698.66 → 2699.36] do is cool.
[2699.84 → 2700.84] We're not a tech company,
[2700.96 → 2701.62] but we figure,
[2701.74 → 2702.02] like,
[2702.18 → 2702.72] we figure,
[2702.98 → 2703.40] Squarespace
[2703.40 → 2704.40] is kind of.
[2705.10 → 2705.74] Everyone needs
[2705.74 → 2706.32] a website,
[2706.44 → 2706.66] though.
[2706.78 → 2707.04] Yeah.
[2707.08 → 2707.70] You don't have to,
[2707.76 → 2707.94] like,
[2708.10 → 2708.98] it's not Intel.
[2709.52 → 2710.34] They don't make hardware.
[2710.54 → 2711.08] They're not a tech hardware.
[2711.08 → 2711.58] By tech,
[2711.64 → 2712.52] I meant hardware,
[2712.66 → 2713.16] to be clear.
[2713.16 → 2713.42] Yeah.
[2713.50 → 2713.60] Yeah.
[2713.82 → 2714.10] Yes.
[2714.20 → 2714.38] Yes.
[2714.38 → 2715.36] Software is technology,
[2715.48 → 2716.12] and quite frankly,
[2716.52 → 2717.74] innovative new business models
[2717.74 → 2718.28] are also.
[2718.28 → 2718.56] I was just going to say,
[2718.92 → 2719.96] razors kind of are,
[2720.10 → 2720.32] too.
[2720.72 → 2720.92] Yeah.
[2721.22 → 2722.18] A lot of things are.
[2722.30 → 2722.58] Okay.
[2722.68 → 2723.10] Arguably,
[2723.28 → 2724.06] this piece of foam
[2724.06 → 2724.78] is technology.
[2724.92 → 2725.50] If you really want to
[2725.50 → 2726.42] start getting into it.
[2726.42 → 2726.46] Fire.
[2726.88 → 2728.06] Fire is technology.
[2728.22 → 2728.62] Thank you.
[2732.04 → 2732.44] Yeah.
[2733.36 → 2733.98] All right.
[2734.36 → 2734.76] So,
[2735.12 → 2735.66] basically,
[2736.06 → 2736.50] um,
[2736.66 → 2737.30] Biotechnology?
[2737.90 → 2739.18] Gillette is suing
[2739.18 → 2740.16] Dollar Shave Club
[2740.16 → 2741.82] for patent
[2741.82 → 2743.14] infringement.
[2743.16 → 2743.30] patent.
[2744.72 → 2745.16] And,
[2745.36 → 2745.76] um,
[2745.84 → 2746.80] You could say that
[2746.80 → 2747.50] Gillette has
[2747.50 → 2748.50] razor burn.
[2750.38 → 2750.90] Wow.
[2754.48 → 2755.58] I was trying to think
[2755.58 → 2756.30] of a funny hook
[2756.30 → 2757.92] for a topic callout.
[2758.22 → 2758.92] I couldn't think of one,
[2759.00 → 2759.36] but I just got it.
[2759.36 → 2759.56] Yeah,
[2759.64 → 2760.82] that is a real slap
[2760.82 → 2761.48] in the face
[2761.48 → 2762.42] to,
[2762.42 → 2762.84] uh,
[2763.02 → 2764.48] Dollar Shave Club there.
[2765.02 → 2765.68] Nice job.
[2766.12 → 2766.76] Good one.
[2767.36 → 2767.64] Okay,
[2767.76 → 2768.70] so a suit was filed
[2768.70 → 2769.32] in,
[2769.32 → 2769.80] uh,
[2769.90 → 2772.76] in a Delaware court
[2772.76 → 2773.54] stating that
[2773.54 → 2774.18] Dollar Shave Club
[2774.18 → 2775.06] razors infringe
[2775.06 → 2776.18] on a Gillette patent
[2776.18 → 2776.96] for the way
[2776.96 → 2777.48] that the razors
[2777.48 → 2778.10] are designed
[2778.10 → 2778.80] as well as
[2778.80 → 2779.42] the materials
[2779.42 → 2780.52] used on the blades.
[2780.98 → 2781.42] Gillette says
[2781.42 → 2782.28] that Dollar Shave Club
[2782.28 → 2783.10] has damaged
[2783.10 → 2783.74] its business
[2783.74 → 2784.30] and threatened
[2784.30 → 2785.38] its intellectual property.
[2785.44 → 2785.92] I'm sure they've
[2785.92 → 2786.50] damaged their business.
[2786.50 → 2786.98] I'm sure they've
[2786.98 → 2787.82] damaged their business.
[2787.90 → 2788.58] Quite heavily,
[2788.70 → 2788.96] actually.
[2789.12 → 2789.78] In the best
[2789.78 → 2790.66] possible way.
[2791.32 → 2792.24] Calling for an
[2792.24 → 2793.12] injunction for
[2793.12 → 2793.78] Dollar Shave Club
[2793.78 → 2794.48] to stop selling
[2794.48 → 2795.54] razors that violate
[2795.54 → 2796.10] the patent
[2796.10 → 2797.06] as well as
[2797.06 → 2798.00] compensation for
[2798.00 → 2798.58] damages.
[2799.22 → 2799.84] A Dollar Shave Club
[2799.84 → 2800.54] representative said
[2800.54 → 2801.00] they're looking
[2801.00 → 2801.98] into the situation.
[2803.80 → 2804.06] Yep,
[2804.14 → 2804.82] so basically,
[2805.04 → 2805.48] um,
[2805.52 → 2806.34] Procter & Gamble
[2806.34 → 2807.18] is going to
[2807.18 → 2808.12] try to,
[2808.12 → 2809.06] um,
[2809.24 → 2809.90] sue away
[2809.90 → 2811.40] the only competition
[2811.40 → 2812.04] that they really
[2812.04 → 2812.88] have and go back
[2812.88 → 2813.54] to being,
[2813.68 → 2813.98] uh,
[2814.24 → 2815.40] basically a monopoly.
[2815.54 → 2816.10] I don't think
[2816.10 → 2817.06] Schick is actually
[2817.06 → 2817.18] open.
[2817.18 → 2817.88] Gillette tried
[2817.88 → 2818.92] their own club
[2818.92 → 2819.32] thing.
[2819.96 → 2820.18] Yep.
[2820.34 → 2821.06] And it probably
[2821.06 → 2822.36] just burned
[2822.36 → 2823.00] and failed
[2823.00 → 2823.72] super hard.
[2823.76 → 2824.16] If I recall
[2824.16 → 2824.50] correctly,
[2824.56 → 2824.94] their pricing
[2824.94 → 2825.60] wasn't very good.
[2825.90 → 2826.18] Um,
[2826.18 → 2826.62] I don't know
[2826.62 → 2826.94] if it was
[2826.94 → 2827.76] available in Canada.
[2827.92 → 2828.26] I remember
[2828.26 → 2829.16] seeing an ad
[2829.16 → 2829.86] for it at some
[2829.86 → 2830.04] point.
[2830.12 → 2830.32] But yeah,
[2830.32 → 2830.82] they just called
[2830.82 → 2831.46] it is like Gillette
[2831.46 → 2831.96] Shave Club
[2831.96 → 2832.62] or something like
[2832.62 → 2832.76] that.
[2832.82 → 2833.16] Like they didn't
[2833.16 → 2834.16] even try.
[2834.56 → 2834.78] Yeah.
[2834.88 → 2835.32] They didn't even,
[2835.38 → 2835.86] they didn't even
[2835.86 → 2836.72] try.
[2837.36 → 2837.52] Like,
[2837.52 → 2837.82] like,
[2837.94 → 2838.50] like Dollar
[2838.50 → 2839.64] Beard Club
[2839.64 → 2840.02] or whatever
[2840.02 → 2840.52] it's called.
[2840.96 → 2841.26] Yeah,
[2841.38 → 2841.84] that thing.
[2841.88 → 2842.78] That's ridiculous
[2842.78 → 2844.06] but I get it.
[2844.68 → 2844.98] Yeah.
[2845.78 → 2846.44] At least it's
[2846.44 → 2847.78] a different product
[2847.78 → 2848.86] I guess.
[2849.20 → 2850.04] That one actually
[2850.04 → 2850.68] weirded me out
[2850.68 → 2851.18] a lot too.
[2851.28 → 2851.80] I was just like,
[2852.10 → 2852.92] they shouldn't
[2852.92 → 2853.36] have done it.
[2853.38 → 2853.70] They should have
[2853.70 → 2854.28] just called it
[2854.28 → 2855.24] something else.
[2855.72 → 2856.02] And then they,
[2856.18 → 2856.56] even if they
[2856.56 → 2857.08] just called it
[2857.08 → 2857.74] Beard Club.
[2858.02 → 2858.24] Yeah,
[2858.24 → 2858.84] and they're like,
[2858.90 → 2859.40] their promotional
[2859.40 → 2860.36] video is a straight
[2860.36 → 2861.14] rip off of the
[2861.14 → 2861.74] Dollar Shave Club
[2861.74 → 2862.52] promotional video.
[2864.28 → 2865.10] I wonder how
[2865.10 → 2865.66] they're doing.
[2865.82 → 2865.94] Like,
[2865.98 → 2866.86] do they still exist?
[2867.02 → 2867.90] Dollar Beard Club?
[2868.00 → 2868.40] I don't know.
[2868.48 → 2869.06] I'm sure they
[2869.06 → 2869.86] probably exist.
[2870.16 → 2870.56] Yeah.
[2870.70 → 2870.94] It's a monthly
[2870.94 → 2871.72] subscription thing.
[2872.02 → 2872.82] If I recall
[2872.82 → 2873.24] correctly,
[2873.36 → 2874.30] even their site
[2874.30 → 2875.36] was like,
[2875.50 → 2876.08] really,
[2876.28 → 2877.36] really similarly
[2877.36 → 2877.90] laid out.
[2878.38 → 2878.48] Yeah,
[2878.54 → 2879.02] to the point
[2879.02 → 2879.78] where I contacted
[2879.78 → 2880.54] Dollar Shave Club
[2880.54 → 2881.16] when I heard about
[2881.16 → 2881.26] it.
[2881.28 → 2881.56] I was like,
[2881.62 → 2882.40] is this you guys?
[2882.86 → 2883.22] Oh.
[2883.62 → 2884.24] And they're just like,
[2884.62 → 2885.14] no.
[2885.14 → 2886.64] That would have
[2886.64 → 2887.16] been smart,
[2887.30 → 2887.42] though.
[2887.52 → 2888.08] Find the dudes
[2888.08 → 2888.72] that want to shave
[2888.72 → 2889.14] with a razor
[2889.14 → 2889.84] and find the dudes
[2889.84 → 2890.42] that don't want to
[2890.42 → 2891.08] shave with a razor
[2891.08 → 2891.98] and cater to both of them.
[2892.00 → 2892.16] Wow,
[2892.22 → 2893.24] their site is really
[2893.24 → 2893.74] slow.
[2893.96 → 2895.34] Or it's...
[2895.34 → 2895.56] Oh,
[2895.66 → 2896.30] how it works.
[2897.12 → 2897.46] Okay.
[2898.18 → 2898.38] Yeah,
[2898.38 → 2898.96] so it's like
[2898.96 → 2900.08] the exact...
[2900.08 → 2900.68] Accelerators?
[2901.26 → 2901.84] Same site.
[2901.84 → 2902.22] Can you make
[2902.22 → 2902.58] your beard
[2902.58 → 2903.32] grow faster?
[2905.58 → 2906.32] Use these
[2906.32 → 2907.02] amazing products
[2907.02 → 2907.56] to help you
[2907.56 → 2908.02] grow a thicker
[2908.02 → 2908.94] full of beard.
[2909.08 → 2909.10] That sounds like
[2909.10 → 2909.92] snake oil.
[2910.42 → 2911.44] It's probably oils.
[2912.24 → 2913.08] Probably oils.
[2913.76 → 2914.78] It might be a real thing.
[2914.88 → 2916.00] I just never heard
[2916.00 → 2916.34] of that.
[2916.58 → 2916.80] Yeah.
[2917.82 → 2918.58] So anyway,
[2918.74 → 2918.96] yeah,
[2919.08 → 2919.38] I guess...
[2919.38 → 2920.96] This is really
[2920.96 → 2921.38] interesting.
[2922.76 → 2923.20] Oh,
[2923.26 → 2923.60] it is.
[2925.70 → 2926.44] This is really
[2926.44 → 2926.80] interesting.
[2926.80 → 2927.44] Apparently,
[2927.56 → 2928.30] Dollar Shave Club
[2928.30 → 2928.96] has more than
[2928.96 → 2931.04] 2 million subscribers.
[2931.36 → 2931.62] Wow.
[2931.76 → 2933.10] Which I actually had...
[2933.10 → 2933.24] Like,
[2933.26 → 2934.24] I had no idea
[2934.24 → 2935.02] how many subscribers
[2935.02 → 2935.44] they have.
[2935.48 → 2935.86] I just,
[2936.44 → 2936.80] you know,
[2936.90 → 2937.96] we work with them.
[2938.44 → 2939.62] They sponsor us.
[2939.66 → 2940.16] We talk about
[2940.16 → 2940.78] Dollar Shave Club.
[2940.88 → 2941.02] I mean,
[2941.04 → 2942.24] I never actually...
[2942.24 → 2942.82] It was like,
[2942.96 → 2943.16] hey,
[2943.24 → 2943.88] could I just get
[2943.88 → 2945.38] a copy of your financials
[2945.38 → 2946.06] so that I can,
[2946.22 → 2947.56] for my own curiosity,
[2947.72 → 2948.46] just kind of know.
[2948.74 → 2949.10] So,
[2949.48 → 2950.68] they have products
[2950.68 → 2951.32] ranging from,
[2951.38 → 2951.68] what is it,
[2951.70 → 2953.36] about $1 to $9
[2953.36 → 2954.56] is the top end one.
[2955.80 → 2956.04] Yeah.
[2956.80 → 2957.38] Per month.
[2957.48 → 2957.62] So,
[2957.70 → 2958.18] what that means,
[2958.24 → 2958.64] if they have
[2958.64 → 2959.98] 2 million subscribers
[2959.98 → 2960.34] is,
[2960.74 → 2961.86] let's average it,
[2961.90 → 2962.90] but let's lean towards
[2962.90 → 2963.70] sort of the lower end.
[2963.76 → 2964.52] Let's say they get
[2964.52 → 2966.68] $4.50 per subscriber
[2966.68 → 2967.56] or something like that.
[2967.56 → 2967.70] What?
[2967.78 → 2968.46] Isn't that exactly
[2968.46 → 2968.88] an average,
[2968.98 → 2970.44] not tuned towards the lower end?
[2970.44 → 2970.66] No,
[2970.74 → 2972.46] because the next one up
[2972.46 → 2973.54] is higher than the middle.
[2974.24 → 2974.62] Oh,
[2974.74 → 2975.10] okay.
[2975.54 → 2975.68] Yeah.
[2975.72 → 2975.84] Yeah.
[2976.92 → 2977.32] So,
[2977.32 → 2979.46] 4.5 times 2 million,
[2979.68 → 2980.52] for some reason,
[2980.64 → 2982.12] that just Bing searched for me.
[2982.20 → 2983.34] You have got to be kidding me.
[2983.34 → 2985.22] This has to be a new behaviour.
[2985.72 → 2987.56] I don't think I've seen it do this before.
[2987.66 → 2987.76] So,
[2987.82 → 2989.92] that would be $9 million a month.
[2991.10 → 2991.54] Wow.
[2992.32 → 2992.72] Yeah,
[2992.86 → 2992.96] but,
[2992.96 → 2993.18] plus,
[2993.36 → 2994.62] butter,
[2995.40 → 2996.50] one wipe Charlie's,
[2996.74 → 2998.80] not bad.
[2999.06 → 2999.30] Yeah,
[2999.30 → 3000.96] but you have to factor in material costs.
[3001.06 → 3001.20] Oh,
[3001.26 → 3001.48] I know.
[3001.56 → 3001.78] It's not,
[3001.92 → 3002.72] it's not pure profit.
[3003.06 → 3003.24] Yeah.
[3003.24 → 3004.30] I do understand that.
[3004.36 → 3005.42] They actually have a warehouse.
[3005.62 → 3007.00] They're actually giving you razors.
[3007.02 → 3008.90] They actually ship a physical product to you.
[3009.06 → 3009.20] Yeah.
[3009.28 → 3009.40] So,
[3009.44 → 3010.08] so get this.
[3010.14 → 3010.56] Get this,
[3010.62 → 3010.98] you guys.
[3012.26 → 3016.40] 4.5 times 2 million,
[3016.74 → 3017.10] okay.
[3017.56 → 3018.66] If I press enter,
[3019.26 → 3021.28] instead of just opening it in calculator,
[3021.44 → 3022.48] which would be the obvious,
[3022.64 → 3023.46] sensible thing to do.
[3023.46 → 3023.70] I know,
[3023.82 → 3025.66] I know it did just give me the answer here.
[3026.36 → 3027.36] It beings it.
[3027.52 → 3027.90] Please,
[3028.14 → 3029.32] never Bing anything,
[3029.52 → 3030.14] Windows 10.
[3030.46 → 3030.86] Never,
[3031.02 → 3031.90] ever Bing anything.
[3031.90 → 3032.72] Not even once.
[3034.04 → 3034.70] Hate Bing.
[3036.00 → 3036.94] And I don't hate it,
[3036.96 → 3037.14] like,
[3037.18 → 3038.22] out of spite or anything.
[3038.32 → 3039.46] It just doesn't work.
[3039.50 → 3039.80] Someone said,
[3039.86 → 3041.00] I can't believe he used the calculator.
[3041.16 → 3043.36] He actually does do a lot of mental math.
[3043.44 → 3046.86] Just when you have 7,000 people watching you live right now,
[3046.98 → 3047.94] and 180,
[3048.14 → 3050.52] 200 and something a thousand people watching you later,
[3050.84 → 3052.24] you might as well check your math.
[3052.24 → 3054.68] And you're also producing the show that you are,
[3054.90 → 3055.62] you know,
[3055.72 → 3057.24] one of only two talents on.
[3057.42 → 3057.82] Producing and hosting,
[3058.08 → 3058.72] and all that kind of stuff.
[3059.04 → 3059.26] And,
[3059.34 → 3059.50] like,
[3059.68 → 3062.06] if you've been in high level education,
[3062.20 → 3062.88] you probably check,
[3062.88 → 3063.52] like,
[3063.68 → 3066.84] I found that even dudes that could do basically any mental math
[3066.84 → 3068.74] would just check their stuff on a calculator anyway.
[3069.30 → 3071.12] And then if what they thought was going to happen,
[3071.26 → 3072.32] didn't happen on the calculator,
[3072.78 → 3075.06] then they wouldn't make sure their calculator wasn't broken.
[3075.44 → 3077.42] They would make sure that they input it correctly.
[3077.42 → 3078.32] And last but not least,
[3078.38 → 3080.00] we had a data loss thing this week,
[3080.04 → 3081.12] and I haven't slept much,
[3081.12 → 3082.34] and my daughter's sick,
[3082.46 → 3085.08] so I was up at 545 this morning,
[3085.48 → 3087.62] and I didn't sleep until 2 last night,
[3088.14 → 3089.58] so I'm super-duper tired.
[3089.68 → 3091.40] Having a second input for your math is not bad.
[3091.40 → 3092.02] So,
[3092.20 → 3094.20] exclusive on Tech Spot,
[3094.68 → 3099.26] overclocking locked Intel Skylike CPUs is now possible.
[3100.04 → 3100.34] Dun,
[3100.58 → 3101.04] dun,
[3101.32 → 3101.68] dun.
[3101.68 → 3103.40] So,
[3103.60 → 3109.20] AS Rock has apparently implemented this already on some of their motherboards with a BIOS update
[3109.20 → 3113.80] that enables overclocking for non-K SKUs,
[3114.02 → 3121.20] which pretty much the benefit of a K-SKU is that you can overclock it.
[3122.16 → 3122.56] Because,
[3122.90 → 3123.28] I mean,
[3123.46 → 3123.70] yes,
[3123.78 → 3125.42] they are clocked higher out of the box,
[3126.14 → 3127.38] but if you can overclock,
[3127.46 → 3128.46] a lot of the time,
[3128.74 → 3131.42] the binning differences from one chip to another one,
[3131.44 → 3132.32] unless you're talking like,
[3132.36 → 3132.48] oh,
[3132.50 → 3133.68] I really need that extra,
[3134.06 → 3134.30] you know,
[3134.40 → 3137.86] 0.67 of a watt of idle power consumption or whatever,
[3138.22 → 3141.82] it doesn't affect the final overclocking clock speed that much.
[3141.88 → 3143.38] There are a lot of other things that they bin for.
[3143.48 → 3144.16] Operating voltage,
[3144.46 → 3144.96] temperatures,
[3145.52 → 3146.32] power consumption,
[3146.44 → 3147.52] all that other kind of stuff.
[3147.80 → 3147.98] So,
[3148.04 → 3151.18] being able to overclock locked Skylike CPUs,
[3151.20 → 3151.78] processors,
[3152.30 → 3153.34] kind of big deal.
[3153.60 → 3155.38] The update will be rolled out soon,
[3155.50 → 3158.00] and the speculation is that although AS Rock is the first,
[3158.42 → 3160.42] other motherboard makers will follow.
[3160.92 → 3161.28] So,
[3161.42 → 3164.50] the vendors do need to implement a specific workaround for this,
[3164.54 → 3166.86] and you can bet that Intel is not going to be thrilled about it.
[3166.86 → 3167.48] I was just going to say,
[3167.54 → 3169.18] Intel is not going to be stoked on that.
[3169.20 → 3169.44] Nope,
[3169.56 → 3169.98] they are not,
[3170.04 → 3170.88] but quite frankly,
[3171.56 → 3172.02] I mean,
[3173.22 → 3175.92] Intel has already started to relax the death grip.
[3176.36 → 3178.26] When they released the Pentium Anniversary Edition,
[3178.44 → 3180.46] they gave us a non-K unlocked SKU.
[3181.20 → 3184.34] I hope that this is a move towards,
[3185.18 → 3185.64] you know,
[3186.20 → 3189.38] maybe we just won't lock this stuff down anymore because,
[3190.20 → 3190.54] yeah,
[3190.84 → 3192.92] maybe we could differentiate with different features,
[3193.18 → 3194.44] like giving them more cores,
[3194.66 → 3195.06] or like,
[3195.26 → 3195.60] you know,
[3196.56 → 3198.98] higher end virtualization technology capabilities,
[3199.16 → 3200.20] more PCI Express lanes.
[3200.20 → 3202.70] I am all over that virtualization stuff right now.
[3202.70 → 3204.18] I am loving it.
[3204.18 → 3204.30] Well,
[3204.30 → 3207.58] the difference is that I've always loved the idea,
[3208.00 → 3210.52] but I've never had the time to sit down and go,
[3210.64 → 3210.74] okay,
[3210.80 → 3212.62] I am going to learn VMware today.
[3213.04 → 3215.20] It's just never really happened for me.
[3215.44 → 3216.14] And Unpaid has,
[3216.26 → 3216.34] A,
[3216.36 → 3217.14] made it really simple,
[3217.60 → 3218.10] and B,
[3218.16 → 3220.88] given me a reason to deploy it on systems,
[3221.38 → 3224.30] other than just to have virtualization.
[3224.30 → 3224.66] Yeah.
[3224.94 → 3227.74] The fact that so many of our systems are also,
[3228.24 → 3228.90] are NAS,
[3229.00 → 3230.34] are overpowered Cases.
[3231.14 → 3231.52] It's like,
[3231.72 → 3234.48] we are like a prime candidate for Unpaid,
[3234.78 → 3238.64] because we've got all these NAS machines that are chock-full of Eons and a bunch of RAM,
[3238.72 → 3239.20] and it's like,
[3239.74 → 3240.00] yeah,
[3240.10 → 3240.62] if I could,
[3240.74 → 3242.48] if I could have like,
[3242.60 → 3244.78] Overpowered Cases that go down all the time.
[3245.14 → 3245.58] Well,
[3245.90 → 3247.18] that's a whole other conversation,
[3247.48 → 3251.88] but if I could use some of that CPU power on my overpowered Cases to,
[3252.18 → 3253.56] Maybe that's why they're going down all the time.
[3253.58 → 3255.26] render watch folders or whatever else,
[3255.38 → 3255.64] then,
[3255.66 → 3256.38] then great.
[3256.74 → 3257.66] That's good news.
[3257.84 → 3258.28] Love it.
[3260.76 → 3261.76] This is hilarious.
[3261.98 → 3262.76] It's already patched.
[3262.76 → 3263.08] By the way,
[3263.08 → 3264.26] the last one was from Aiming.
[3264.34 → 3264.36] Oh,
[3264.36 → 3264.58] yeah.
[3265.74 → 3267.14] Already patched,
[3267.14 → 3267.58] but,
[3267.92 → 3268.36] um,
[3268.36 → 3270.18] and the
[3270.22 → 3270.62] ah,
[3270.80 → 3272.00] the headline here is,
[3272.06 → 3272.78] is very,
[3272.78 → 3273.18] uh,
[3273.18 → 3275.56] sensationalist because it's already patched.
[3275.68 → 3276.18] What?
[3276.38 → 3278.16] How do I make this ad go away?
[3278.78 → 3279.78] What the crap,
[3279.90 → 3280.40] life hacker?
[3280.60 → 3281.34] Oh my God.
[3281.36 → 3282.50] It covers the headline.
[3283.04 → 3283.52] Stop.
[3284.42 → 3284.72] Okay.
[3284.76 → 3285.74] If I click expand,
[3285.82 → 3286.58] does it go away?
[3287.42 → 3287.94] No,
[3288.06 → 3289.20] expand does nothing.
[3291.00 → 3291.44] Rest.
[3291.76 → 3292.06] Uh,
[3292.10 → 3293.90] you can read the headline in the URL.
[3295.44 → 3296.84] What the crap?
[3297.56 → 3298.04] Okay.
[3298.04 → 3298.32] Yeah.
[3298.32 → 3298.84] Thank you.
[3299.10 → 3303.28] You can break into a Linux system by pressing backspace.
[3304.28 → 3305.90] And then the headline.
[3306.10 → 3306.82] It's 28,
[3306.88 → 3307.80] 28 times.
[3307.86 → 3308.34] I don't know why.
[3308.80 → 3309.24] Yeah.
[3309.36 → 3309.56] Yeah.
[3310.10 → 3310.64] Um,
[3311.00 → 3311.86] so yeah,
[3311.86 → 3312.90] do you want to run through this?
[3313.46 → 3313.94] Uh,
[3313.94 → 3314.54] basically,
[3314.94 → 3317.12] as far as I knew,
[3317.40 → 3319.78] you literally just press in the bootloader,
[3319.82 → 3321.52] press backspace 28 times,
[3321.52 → 3325.24] and then it asks you for your username to access the grub rescue shell.
[3325.64 → 3328.38] And then you can access all the things.
[3329.58 → 3330.02] Yep.
[3330.02 → 3333.02] So that was patched really fast.
[3333.02 → 3335.74] And that's about it.
[3336.02 → 3336.16] I mean,
[3336.20 → 3337.54] it's one of those things where it's like,
[3337.64 → 3339.86] who would even do that?
[3339.86 → 3340.58] So the
[3340.66 → 3342.18] so the fact that it sat there for,
[3342.28 → 3344.28] what was it like eight years or something like that,
[3344.28 → 3344.86] um,
[3344.86 → 3347.46] was uncovered by a couple of security researchers in Spain.
[3347.46 → 3350.48] And you need like direct physical access.
[3350.64 → 3350.84] Yep.
[3350.84 → 3351.72] And like,
[3352.42 → 3353.28] uh,
[3353.72 → 3354.10] yeah.
[3354.50 → 3357.82] Like it's not the end of the world either.
[3358.12 → 3358.86] It's pretty funny.
[3358.86 → 3362.34] But it's pretty careless and pretty funny.
[3362.70 → 3363.14] And,
[3363.26 → 3363.66] uh,
[3363.76 → 3364.08] yeah,
[3364.30 → 3364.72] hopefully,
[3364.88 → 3367.42] hopefully no one was actually compromised by it.
[3367.42 → 3367.88] They,
[3367.96 → 3368.82] they patched it really,
[3369.00 → 3369.46] really quickly.
[3369.62 → 3370.38] Really fast.
[3371.06 → 3371.22] Yeah.
[3371.54 → 3371.74] Uh,
[3371.82 → 3373.00] Seagate's CFO.
[3373.18 → 3375.54] This was originally posted by Z Mule on the forum.
[3376.06 → 3376.44] Figures,
[3376.54 → 3380.24] hard drives are going to stay relevant for the next 20 years.
[3380.24 → 3382.64] The original article here is from Ann and tech.
[3383.92 → 3384.42] Um,
[3385.08 → 3385.92] so I,
[3386.00 → 3386.40] I don't see.
[3386.52 → 3387.22] It's hilarious.
[3387.22 → 3388.26] Cause like a lot of the
[3388.26 → 3389.16] a lot of the
[3389.16 → 3390.18] the blurb here,
[3390.22 → 3390.90] I really,
[3391.06 → 3391.80] you know,
[3391.80 → 3393.64] don't really understand the relevance.
[3393.86 → 3399.56] The very first hard disk drives were demonstrated by IBM back in 1956.
[3400.18 → 3403.36] The hard drive has held up for all these,
[3403.42 → 3403.72] you know,
[3403.82 → 3404.86] 60 years.
[3404.86 → 3408.40] And so it's probably got another 15 to 20 years left.
[3408.48 → 3408.94] You know what?
[3408.94 → 3411.92] The past is actually zero indication of the future.
[3412.34 → 3412.66] Um,
[3412.66 → 3414.44] especially when it comes to high technology,
[3414.62 → 3415.36] you know what else,
[3415.48 → 3415.72] you know,
[3415.72 → 3416.68] what else held up had,
[3416.74 → 3418.22] had lasted a really long time.
[3418.44 → 3419.84] Phones without touchscreens.
[3420.74 → 3421.46] Where are they,
[3421.80 → 3422.66] where are they now?
[3423.52 → 3424.20] Oh yeah.
[3424.50 → 3424.90] Remember,
[3425.04 → 3429.58] remember how quickly that transition happened between the phone that's attached to the wall
[3429.58 → 3431.68] and the phone that you can carry around the house with you.
[3432.40 → 3434.06] That was like overnight,
[3434.26 → 3436.62] like over a span of like a couple of years,
[3437.16 → 3441.08] everyone and their dog went from like twirling.
[3441.14 → 3441.68] It's hilarious.
[3441.68 → 3446.64] Cause you watch old movies and like the girls on the bed with the feet behind her twirling the phone cord.
[3446.64 → 3447.32] And it's just like,
[3448.06 → 3449.84] there's something off about this.
[3450.86 → 3452.54] We had like a lot of people that,
[3452.72 → 3453.70] that I knew did this too,
[3453.74 → 3457.56] is you'd have one corded phone, and it was the old one that just somehow kept working.
[3457.56 → 3461.02] And you'd keep it in the house just in case all the cordless phones died.
[3461.28 → 3461.38] Yeah.
[3461.38 → 3461.82] It was like,
[3461.88 → 3462.06] oh,
[3462.14 → 3462.46] whatever.
[3462.60 → 3463.54] You can use that one,
[3463.58 → 3463.90] I guess.
[3463.98 → 3464.92] While the other one charges,
[3465.04 → 3465.58] then just switch.
[3466.94 → 3467.30] So,
[3467.52 → 3467.80] uh,
[3467.80 → 3468.12] basically.
[3468.12 → 3469.64] If people even have house phones anymore,
[3469.72 → 3470.86] that was a huge switch.
[3471.22 → 3471.58] Yeah.
[3472.20 → 3472.38] Yeah.
[3472.38 → 3473.30] I don't have one.
[3473.42 → 3474.70] We don't have a line at the office.
[3474.96 → 3479.06] It's finally starting to get to the point where they're starting to remove home phone from forms,
[3479.32 → 3479.96] signup forms.
[3480.48 → 3481.42] Have you noticed that?
[3481.48 → 3481.74] No.
[3481.94 → 3482.64] Not a ton of them,
[3482.68 → 3484.18] but I've noticed a few signup forms.
[3484.30 → 3486.48] They don't bother with the home phone line anymore.
[3487.56 → 3488.44] It's funny.
[3488.44 → 3488.80] Or,
[3488.92 → 3491.42] or the mandatory flag is not on home phone.
[3491.52 → 3492.30] It's on mobile phone.
[3492.70 → 3493.50] I've seen that too.
[3493.78 → 3494.06] Wow.
[3494.12 → 3495.10] I haven't seen that before.
[3495.60 → 3495.94] That one.
[3496.00 → 3497.06] I think I've only seen that once.
[3497.62 → 3498.16] All right.
[3498.18 → 3498.52] So,
[3498.52 → 3498.88] uh,
[3498.88 → 3501.76] hard drives to stay relevant for the next 15 to 20 years.
[3501.86 → 3502.02] Landlines.
[3502.56 → 3503.00] Um,
[3504.26 → 3504.68] to stay,
[3504.82 → 3505.16] this,
[3505.22 → 3505.66] this is great.
[3505.72 → 3507.50] One of the keys is that to stay relevant,
[3507.78 → 3509.90] HDDs need to keep increasing capacity.
[3511.08 → 3512.44] According to the tech roadmap,
[3512.44 → 3516.18] hard drives will rise to 100 terabytes by 2025.
[3516.18 → 3518.22] And in the coming years,
[3518.22 → 3520.50] they will adopt new writing techniques.
[3521.06 → 3521.32] To be sure,
[3521.40 → 3522.82] when terabyte drives came out,
[3522.86 → 3523.18] I was like,
[3523.26 → 3523.60] wow,
[3523.80 → 3526.26] I can just get one of those and put everything on it.
[3526.50 → 3526.82] Yeah.
[3526.82 → 3528.42] It'll keep everything forever.
[3528.78 → 3530.90] Now my like four terabyte hard drive,
[3530.96 → 3531.22] I'm like,
[3531.30 → 3531.64] uh,
[3531.68 → 3533.84] I kind of need like twice that amount of space.
[3533.96 → 3537.56] I do still have some major concerns about 100 terabyte drives.
[3537.62 → 3538.18] There's some good,
[3538.32 → 3540.08] there are actually some good graphs in the
[3540.12 → 3540.42] uh,
[3540.86 → 3541.72] in the article here.
[3541.72 → 3544.62] So here we have perpendicular magnetic recording.
[3544.62 → 3545.38] So that's,
[3545.38 → 3546.28] that's now.
[3546.46 → 3548.74] Then we have perpendicular magnetic recording,
[3548.90 → 3549.70] but like more better.
[3549.80 → 3550.44] So plus,
[3550.44 → 3551.38] um,
[3551.38 → 3554.80] then there's heat assisted magnetic recording that is apparently going to get us,
[3554.80 → 3555.82] uh,
[3556.00 → 3559.00] somewhere in the neighbourhood of,
[3559.06 → 3559.92] so here's where we're at now.
[3559.98 → 3560.84] 2015 is,
[3560.88 → 3561.66] is our baseline.
[3561.66 → 3564.44] So that's apparently going to get us up to,
[3564.44 → 3566.44] wait,
[3566.54 → 3567.08] is this a
[3567.08 → 3568.22] is this a logarithmic scale?
[3570.28 → 3570.56] Uh,
[3570.56 → 3570.74] yeah,
[3570.76 → 3571.74] I think this is a hundred.
[3572.58 → 3573.02] Yeah.
[3573.36 → 3573.66] Oh,
[3573.76 → 3574.96] crying out loud.
[3575.30 → 3575.76] Okay.
[3575.84 → 3576.08] Well,
[3576.10 → 3577.84] that does not make my life easier right now.
[3577.84 → 3578.92] So that gets us to,
[3578.92 → 3580.16] um,
[3580.16 → 3581.06] percentages.
[3581.46 → 3581.68] What are,
[3581.78 → 3582.04] what are,
[3582.16 → 3582.90] what are we at?
[3582.96 → 3585.38] So we're at about 10 terabytes right now.
[3585.84 → 3589.50] So halfway to a hundred would be what?
[3590.36 → 3590.84] Uh,
[3591.64 → 3593.32] math was never a strong point for me.
[3593.32 → 3593.54] Like,
[3593.62 → 3595.00] like this kind of math anyway.
[3595.18 → 3599.80] So a hundred terabytes by 2025 and in the year 2019,
[3599.80 → 3602.24] sort of somewhere in the neighbourhood of it looks like,
[3602.66 → 3602.86] see,
[3602.96 → 3603.30] this is,
[3603.46 → 3607.80] but this is a measure of aerial density in terabytes per inch squared.
[3607.98 → 3612.36] So I have to also convert that to the capacities of the drives that we have today.
[3612.58 → 3612.92] There's the graph.
[3613.06 → 3613.66] There's other,
[3613.80 → 3614.06] there's,
[3614.14 → 3614.40] there's,
[3614.48 → 3614.70] yeah,
[3614.78 → 3615.30] screw the graph.
[3615.56 → 3618.38] There are other factors like how many platters they're going to put in a drive.
[3618.38 → 3622.84] So things like helium filled drives will allow for more platters within a drive.
[3623.34 → 3623.82] Um,
[3624.82 → 3626.30] so they figure with air inside,
[3626.30 → 3628.76] you can get around five discs with helium.
[3628.90 → 3630.14] You can get around seven,
[3630.14 → 3631.08] um,
[3631.08 → 3634.62] with also power consumption decrease as well as a temperature decrease.
[3634.62 → 3640.24] So there's a bunch of stuff that's coming to increase the aerial density and increase the number of platters and,
[3640.24 → 3641.64] and make them higher capacity.
[3641.64 → 3644.48] But here is my concern.
[3645.42 → 3648.52] While over the last five to eight years,
[3648.52 → 3653.08] we have seen a huge improvement in capacity of drives.
[3653.32 → 3658.14] Like I still remember building my first computer in high school when I was like,
[3658.22 → 3659.04] so it would have been about 10,
[3659.22 → 3659.56] 11,
[3659.70 → 3660.20] 12 years ago.
[3660.24 → 3661.02] I don't know how old I am.
[3661.30 → 3661.68] Uh,
[3661.68 → 3662.74] about 12 years ago.
[3662.74 → 3663.38] And like,
[3663.82 → 3664.16] you know,
[3664.24 → 3666.14] 120 gigs was pretty good.
[3666.14 → 3668.34] And now I can have an eight terabyte drive.
[3668.34 → 3673.40] The problem is that they've only about two and a half X in speed in that time.
[3673.40 → 3686.08] And we're running into that problem that USB two drives ran into where the flash capacity got so high that you could literally have a thumb drive that would take you several days to fill up.
[3686.90 → 3687.78] And it's like,
[3687.84 → 3690.28] what is the actual point of this anymore?
[3691.46 → 3694.40] It's gotten to the point where this is just kind of stupid now.
[3694.40 → 3695.32] Um,
[3695.32 → 3703.40] so a drive that takes so long to fill and so long to read all the data off of becomes very difficult to back up.
[3703.78 → 3704.18] Uh,
[3704.18 → 3707.24] becomes kind of impractical in some ways.
[3707.68 → 3708.42] So I,
[3708.42 → 3709.08] I don't know.
[3709.30 → 3709.72] I don't know.
[3709.84 → 3710.18] I guess,
[3710.28 → 3710.60] um,
[3710.76 → 3710.92] you know,
[3710.94 → 3711.06] hey,
[3711.10 → 3712.96] maybe I'm totally wrong about this, and we'll,
[3713.02 → 3713.28] uh,
[3713.76 → 3715.50] and we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
[3715.50 → 3718.54] And they'll find ways to also dramatically increase the reliability.
[3719.28 → 3719.64] Because if,
[3719.70 → 3719.84] you know,
[3719.90 → 3722.68] you're going to write a hundred terabytes of data to a drive at a time,
[3722.68 → 3725.02] I sure as heck hope that that's not going to,
[3725.08 → 3725.34] you know,
[3725.36 → 3727.98] make one mistake in a thousand,
[3728.22 → 3728.64] you know,
[3728.68 → 3729.48] billion or whatever.
[3729.64 → 3730.20] A hundred billion.
[3730.36 → 3730.74] There we go.
[3730.78 → 3731.32] A hundred billion.
[3731.76 → 3734.76] It can't make one mistake in a hundred billion, or you've got a problem.
[3737.96 → 3738.32] Yeah.
[3738.38 → 3739.08] That's a little scary.
[3739.68 → 3740.16] To be fair.
[3740.36 → 3741.20] That's not even bits.
[3741.30 → 3741.80] Times eight.
[3742.18 → 3743.92] If you're going to be backups,
[3744.16 → 3745.66] a lot of people do incremental backups.
[3746.16 → 3746.46] Mm-hmm.
[3746.50 → 3749.44] Instead of like waiting until they have a giant thing and then backing it up.
[3749.44 → 3750.18] That's true.
[3750.40 → 3750.72] But,
[3750.92 → 3751.38] um,
[3752.76 → 3755.00] I mean,
[3755.10 → 3755.42] if you,
[3755.48 → 3756.64] if you're doing a seed copy,
[3756.98 → 3758.22] if you buy a new drive,
[3758.32 → 3760.22] you will have to put stuff on it.
[3760.22 → 3762.28] If the objective is to buy that new drive or even,
[3762.40 → 3765.50] even doing something like if you're using a product like Unpaid,
[3766.14 → 3767.42] doing a parody sync,
[3767.76 → 3769.30] that will take a long time.
[3769.44 → 3769.64] Oh yeah.
[3769.78 → 3775.86] Reading a hundred terabytes of data off of all of your drives while you build a parody
[3775.86 → 3778.28] disk is going to take a really long time.
[3778.28 → 3778.92] It's going to suck.
[3779.20 → 3779.52] So.
[3780.08 → 3780.60] I don't know.
[3780.76 → 3784.56] One thing that I'm really interested in is the fact that we still have data caps
[3784.56 → 3785.70] and data caps are even like,
[3786.00 → 3787.86] the amount of data caps is increasing.
[3788.06 → 3788.40] Not necessarily.
[3788.40 → 3789.38] You mean like mobile data?
[3790.24 → 3790.44] Uh,
[3790.44 → 3790.60] no.
[3790.78 → 3790.92] Oh,
[3791.00 → 3791.50] internet data.
[3791.62 → 3791.78] Yeah.
[3791.84 → 3792.18] Oh yeah.
[3792.28 → 3792.42] Yeah.
[3792.64 → 3793.08] Um,
[3793.08 → 3796.76] and like the amount of places that have data caps seem to be increasing.
[3796.96 → 3798.88] The data caps themselves are not increasing.
[3798.88 → 3801.92] That would be nice if they would increase to the point where they don't matter.
[3802.14 → 3802.78] They're not.
[3802.78 → 3803.50] Um,
[3803.50 → 3809.94] but the amount of places that have them is increasing yet game sizes and Netflix and
[3809.94 → 3813.74] all of this kind of stuff is massively increasing the amount that we need to download.
[3814.10 → 3814.78] Um,
[3814.78 → 3816.20] YouTube and higher definition,
[3816.38 → 3818.94] Netflix at all.
[3819.30 → 3819.74] Um,
[3819.74 → 3823.20] game sizes being like all 50 gigs or above these days.
[3823.20 → 3824.16] Um,
[3825.18 → 3827.12] like I'm luckily my eyes,
[3827.12 → 3827.40] Pete,
[3827.52 → 3827.82] uh,
[3827.82 → 3829.52] seems to mostly ignore it.
[3829.64 → 3832.68] I'm over my data cap every month and I have the most expensive one I can get.
[3833.02 → 3833.38] Yep.
[3833.76 → 3834.12] Like,
[3835.24 → 3835.80] okay.
[3835.80 → 3836.20] It's getting kind of,
[3836.20 → 3836.50] it's getting,
[3836.50 → 3838.04] I don't even feel like I do anything crazy.
[3838.40 → 3838.56] Yeah.
[3838.56 → 3840.22] Like I actually don't feel like I did.
[3840.26 → 3843.26] There are lots of things that I would love to do that I can't because I'm like,
[3843.32 → 3843.48] well,
[3843.54 → 3846.34] I would be way over my data cap, and they definitely pissed at me that.
[3846.62 → 3846.88] Shaw,
[3847.02 → 3849.30] Shaw recently dialled back like all of their services.
[3849.30 → 3850.02] Um,
[3850.56 → 3853.98] and the problem is that I don't have good ex-service in my area.
[3854.08 → 3855.12] Like you've got their,
[3855.18 → 3856.32] you've got their fibre service,
[3856.42 → 3857.98] which is like good for you,
[3858.02 → 3858.32] buddy.
[3858.62 → 3859.50] That's awesome.
[3859.62 → 3859.98] And like,
[3860.08 → 3861.26] I spent nothing for me.
[3861.42 → 3862.38] I spent way too much.
[3862.50 → 3864.54] It's my highest monthly bill outside of rent.
[3865.02 → 3865.98] And seriously,
[3865.98 → 3868.96] and I still hit their data cap all the time.
[3869.04 → 3869.42] Um,
[3869.48 → 3871.34] whereas like in my area there,
[3871.34 → 3875.72] there's still ADSL, and it's 25 down one up or something stupid like that.
[3875.92 → 3876.30] I was like,
[3876.32 → 3877.12] take a hike.
[3877.42 → 3878.92] I think I can get unlimited data,
[3878.92 → 3881.36] but I have to spend like 40 more bucks a month or something,
[3881.56 → 3882.40] which is just like,
[3882.40 → 3883.62] Holy crap.
[3883.70 → 3886.38] I basically have to get an entirely new internet plan.
[3886.82 → 3887.10] Right.
[3887.88 → 3888.28] Well,
[3888.44 → 3890.68] I actually have a plan for,
[3890.82 → 3891.58] for my house.
[3891.58 → 3896.76] If I can find a way to put like a tower on top of the Linus media group building.
[3897.54 → 3898.02] Beam,
[3898.10 → 3898.98] beam your not,
[3899.02 → 3900.66] not limited internet from here.
[3901.76 → 3906.38] So we actually got a really cool piece of equipment from ubiquity networks.
[3907.00 → 3907.64] It's here.
[3908.00 → 3908.44] Yeah,
[3908.44 → 3908.80] I'm going to have a lot of heads here.
[3908.80 → 3909.46] Um,
[3909.46 → 3911.00] so we've got a dish based,
[3911.00 → 3911.34] uh,
[3911.34 → 3913.04] five gigahertz long distance.
[3913.04 → 3916.62] Like one of the ones we have can do 500 megabits over around 200 kilometres.
[3917.40 → 3917.94] Um,
[3917.94 → 3918.54] wow,
[3918.54 → 3919.48] wow,
[3919.48 → 3920.48] that's really far.
[3920.90 → 3921.10] Yeah.
[3921.10 → 3922.52] It's like actually like,
[3922.52 → 3923.44] like,
[3923.44 → 3923.78] you,
[3923.88 → 3926.14] it would take you two hours to drive.
[3926.14 → 3926.52] Yeah.
[3926.52 → 3927.58] wow.
[3927.58 → 3928.46] That's really cool.
[3928.46 → 3928.96] Um,
[3929.12 → 3931.58] but you have to have a direct line of sight.
[3931.58 → 3933.88] So if when we're like ancient and retired,
[3933.88 → 3935.62] we should get like cabins,
[3935.62 → 3937.68] but then have like land networking.
[3937.68 → 3938.18] Yeah.
[3938.18 → 3942.04] play Halo one.
[3942.04 → 3942.70] When Linus,
[3942.70 → 3944.40] when Linus media group,
[3944.44 → 3944.90] you know,
[3945.02 → 3950.14] takes off, and we can all just retire and like live in the woods because whatever.
[3950.14 → 3950.46] Yeah.
[3950.46 → 3950.82] No,
[3950.82 → 3952.46] I didn't mean like a vacation cabin.
[3952.62 → 3953.30] I meant like a
[3953.82 → 3955.86] we just don't want to be near society for whatever reason.
[3955.86 → 3955.94] Yeah.
[3955.98 → 3956.22] So,
[3956.34 → 3956.94] so basically,
[3957.24 → 3957.90] you know,
[3957.98 → 3959.00] we just kind of go,
[3959.12 → 3959.38] okay.
[3959.46 → 3959.64] Uh,
[3959.64 → 3960.90] we tell our ISP like,
[3960.94 → 3961.18] okay,
[3961.18 → 3961.62] how far,
[3961.70 → 3962.86] how close can you get fibre?
[3963.44 → 3963.84] Okay.
[3963.84 → 3964.98] Get it to one of us.
[3964.98 → 3965.38] Yeah.
[3965.68 → 3966.80] And then we just build like,
[3966.90 → 3968.54] we build our own tower.
[3968.86 → 3969.14] Uh,
[3969.14 → 3970.20] people were telling me,
[3970.24 → 3972.58] someone was telling me that apparently there's a community that,
[3972.66 → 3973.38] that did this.
[3973.66 → 3973.88] Really?
[3973.88 → 3976.66] Like a remote community that was just like,
[3976.72 → 3978.36] we are tired of this bull crap.
[3978.36 → 3981.06] And they used this kind of gear to,
[3981.16 → 3982.82] to bring in one really great connection.
[3982.90 → 3983.16] They like,
[3983.20 → 3985.54] they built their own ISP network thing.
[3985.70 → 3986.26] I was like,
[3986.28 → 3987.24] that is so cool.
[3987.28 → 3988.08] That's pretty sick.
[3988.18 → 3989.22] That is so cool.
[3989.26 → 3989.38] Like,
[3989.38 → 3989.84] did they one,
[3990.16 → 3993.84] did they run one line and then like flush it out or did they beam it all the way?
[3993.96 → 3994.16] They,
[3994.22 → 3994.46] they,
[3994.58 → 3994.84] no,
[3994.90 → 3995.80] they ran a line,
[3995.92 → 3996.74] I think,
[3996.78 → 3999.50] and then they're beaming it to all the remote like houses and stuff.
[3999.54 → 4001.38] And people are just building towers to receive it.
[4001.80 → 4002.64] So cool.
[4002.64 → 4004.42] That's a really cool way to get away from dialogue.
[4004.56 → 4004.74] I mean,
[4004.82 → 4005.34] I actually,
[4005.52 → 4006.40] just for giggles,
[4006.62 → 4006.78] I,
[4006.78 → 4008.32] I got the ISP that,
[4008.40 → 4010.48] so we had to build out fibre to this location.
[4010.66 → 4011.52] I wasn't here already.
[4011.90 → 4012.22] In fact,
[4012.30 → 4013.38] no one was here already.
[4013.52 → 4014.44] Shaw was like,
[4014.56 → 4015.00] um,
[4015.10 → 4015.34] yeah,
[4015.40 → 4015.68] I don't know.
[4015.74 → 4016.80] I guess if you want service,
[4016.92 → 4020.78] you can like check with other people in the building and see if they want it to.
[4020.82 → 4021.84] And if you can get enough people,
[4021.92 → 4022.60] then we'll bring it out.
[4022.86 → 4023.06] Like,
[4023.08 → 4024.28] are you freaking kidding me?
[4025.14 → 4025.50] No,
[4026.04 → 4030.96] your entire job as the monopoly holder is to build the stupid infrastructure.
[4030.96 → 4031.50] I'm sorry.
[4031.50 → 4032.42] We're in a new neighbourhood.
[4032.70 → 4033.20] I'm sorry.
[4033.24 → 4034.48] It's not convenient for you.
[4036.10 → 4036.50] Anyway,
[4036.60 → 4036.90] anyway,
[4036.98 → 4037.28] anyway,
[4037.28 → 4038.48] for fibre,
[4038.76 → 4040.28] you'd kind of do have to deal with that.
[4040.34 → 4040.54] So,
[4040.62 → 4044.42] so we had to build out fibre to the building here in addition to our monthly bill.
[4044.58 → 4045.66] So for giggles,
[4046.12 → 4046.92] I got,
[4047.12 → 4050.84] I got a quote on what it would cost to build up fibre to my house.
[4050.84 → 4051.28] Uh,
[4052.22 → 4056.74] I think it was going to cost something to the tune of 10 to $15,000.
[4057.80 → 4059.82] But think about this for a second.
[4060.92 → 4063.96] If you were in a place that's like in,
[4063.96 → 4068.12] in an area like mine where there's a bunch of by laws and this and that,
[4068.22 → 4069.72] you wouldn't be able to get away with this.
[4070.00 → 4073.26] But if you were in a more remote community where,
[4073.70 → 4074.02] you know,
[4074.10 → 4076.36] people actually get together at the town hall,
[4076.50 → 4076.76] you know,
[4076.82 → 4079.82] once a quarter and talk about community issues and you kind of went,
[4079.92 → 4080.08] okay,
[4080.14 → 4080.68] look guys,
[4080.84 → 4086.80] it's going to cost us 10 or $15,000 to get fibre built out to like this spot.
[4086.94 → 4087.90] But if we put up,
[4088.06 → 4089.82] if we put up a little tower and we,
[4089.88 → 4091.56] if we pay just one monthly bill,
[4091.74 → 4093.50] we can all have low latency,
[4094.06 → 4098.86] high speed internet that we otherwise wouldn't be able to have if we all just
[4098.86 → 4099.72] kind of pool together.
[4100.02 → 4101.64] And I could see,
[4101.74 → 4102.74] I could totally see people.
[4102.74 → 4103.06] My,
[4103.06 → 4103.74] my,
[4103.74 → 4105.20] uh,
[4106.02 → 4109.00] grand paper has farm net.
[4109.00 → 4111.90] like dial up farm.
[4112.00 → 4112.88] Can't watch my videos.
[4112.96 → 4113.36] Yeah.
[4113.96 → 4114.50] Straight up.
[4114.56 → 4114.88] Doesn't work.
[4114.88 → 4115.36] Yeah.
[4115.36 → 4121.64] My dad has downloaded them and like sent them to him where he could download them over long,
[4121.64 → 4124.16] long periods of time to watch before.
[4124.16 → 4126.48] Like what?
[4127.14 → 4127.50] Yeah.
[4127.60 → 4129.06] There are not many times when I dropped the like,
[4129.22 → 4130.20] because it's 2015.
[4130.20 → 4131.08] But like,
[4131.16 → 4132.82] how are people still on dial up?
[4133.08 → 4133.40] Yeah.
[4133.58 → 4134.38] It's like,
[4134.42 → 4135.66] actually it's 2015.
[4135.86 → 4136.88] How are people still on dial up?
[4136.88 → 4138.66] And here's the crazy thing about it to me too,
[4138.66 → 4139.02] is like,
[4139.10 → 4141.56] why aren't ISPs just offering this service then?
[4141.60 → 4143.26] Cause the dishes are not that expensive.
[4143.26 → 4143.48] Like,
[4143.54 → 4143.76] yes,
[4143.76 → 4144.32] they're expensive.
[4144.66 → 4146.22] But if I'm charging a customer,
[4146.44 → 4146.64] you know,
[4146.64 → 4147.14] cause that's,
[4147.20 → 4148.34] that's one monthly bill.
[4148.34 → 4148.50] Yeah.
[4148.52 → 4150.94] If I'm charging a customer $80 a month or whatever,
[4151.20 → 4153.50] I can eat a few hundred dollars in equipment costs.
[4153.56 → 4153.66] I mean,
[4153.66 → 4155.12] they already do it on the
[4155.50 → 4155.90] on the
[4155.96 → 4156.10] well,
[4156.16 → 4156.34] okay.
[4156.34 → 4157.04] They don't, actually.
[4157.16 → 4159.40] Some ISPs do charge you a rental fee for your modem.
[4159.54 → 4159.68] So,
[4159.86 → 4160.46] okay,
[4160.54 → 4161.02] never mind.
[4161.58 → 4162.18] But then,
[4162.24 → 4162.62] then fine.
[4162.68 → 4163.74] Make it a rental fee then.
[4163.80 → 4164.70] Make it an additional 10,
[4164.76 → 4168.46] 15 bucks a month over the course of a three-year deal or whatever that works out to.
[4169.68 → 4170.16] You know,
[4170.18 → 4172.60] if you've got a 200-kilometer range on something like this,
[4172.60 → 4173.98] I don't see it being impossible.
[4174.54 → 4176.06] I think they just don't feel like it.
[4176.70 → 4176.86] Yeah.
[4176.86 → 4177.94] It's not even about that.
[4177.96 → 4179.36] There's no profit to be made in it.
[4179.40 → 4180.04] It's just about that.
[4180.12 → 4181.04] It's not enough.
[4181.12 → 4181.74] It sounds weird.
[4181.94 → 4182.78] It sounds like hard work.
[4182.84 → 4182.94] Yeah.
[4182.96 → 4185.18] It sounds like actual work to actually,
[4185.44 → 4185.72] uh,
[4185.74 → 4186.16] I don't know.
[4186.20 → 4186.82] I guess we'd have to,
[4186.94 → 4189.78] I guess we'd have to like to put a dish on a tower and like,
[4190.12 → 4190.56] Oh,
[4190.58 → 4191.72] we have to send someone out there.
[4191.78 → 4193.12] We're probably going to have to pay them extra.
[4193.26 → 4193.50] Yeah.
[4193.50 → 4194.30] We're going to have to pay them to a hotel.
[4194.42 → 4195.32] That sounds like too much.
[4195.40 → 4195.70] Yeah.
[4195.90 → 4196.26] Like,
[4196.34 → 4196.62] Oh,
[4196.64 → 4198.38] it's just one internet connection or,
[4198.62 → 4198.86] yeah.
[4199.34 → 4199.62] Yeah.
[4200.14 → 4200.54] Buttheads.
[4200.54 → 4200.82] Anyway,
[4201.22 → 4202.50] speaking of buttheads,
[4203.24 → 4204.62] we're closing down the show today.
[4204.74 → 4205.92] Thank you guys for tuning in.
[4206.86 → 4207.14] This week,
[4207.24 → 4208.12] same bat time,
[4208.26 → 4209.36] same bat channel.
[4215.48 → 4215.84] Oh,
[4215.92 → 4217.12] the intro's not loading.
[4217.32 → 4217.72] Wrecked.
[4219.08 → 4220.64] We're going to have to make music for it anyway,
[4220.72 → 4220.94] aren't we?
[4221.86 → 4222.86] You know how the song goes?
[4222.98 → 4223.84] Can you play the song on your phone?
[4224.20 → 4224.46] Uh,
[4224.84 → 4225.14] no,
[4225.58 → 4226.40] not in time.
[4226.66 → 4227.78] I'm just waiting for the scene to switch.
[4227.84 → 4229.36] We have 7,000 viewers today.
[4229.78 → 4230.56] 7,000 viewers.
[4230.56 → 4230.74] Wow,
[4230.74 → 4231.42] you guys rock.
[4231.56 → 4232.70] All 7,000 of you,
[4233.02 → 4233.44] rock.
[4233.56 → 4234.56] People are asking about the CISA bill.
[4234.64 → 4234.90] Apparently,
[4234.90 → 4236.84] they're trying to hide a CISA bill in a NASA bill.
[4236.96 → 4238.70] We don't really know that much about American politics.
[4238.84 → 4239.46] Please look it up.
[4239.50 → 4239.98] It's important.
[4240.30 → 4241.70] CISA is like internet stuff.
[4241.86 → 4245.30] And trying to hide it under a NASA budget really pisses me off.
[4245.34 → 4247.04] Because I don't want to say no to the NASA budget.
[4247.14 → 4247.42] But then,
[4247.70 → 4249.14] we also don't want the CISA bill.
[4249.24 → 4249.62] So like,
[4249.70 → 4249.96] what?
[4250.24 → 4251.54] You should probably look it up on your own time.
[4251.60 → 4252.48] Because we don't know enough about it.
[4252.52 → 4252.70] Okay,
[4252.78 → 4253.02] thanks.
[4253.10 → 4253.34] Bye.
