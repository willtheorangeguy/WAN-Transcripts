[0.00 → 5.14] and like what is happening is pretty much the best start we could have possibly expected for
[5.14 → 12.92] a show where we both look and feel totally normal the same right now as we always do thank you for
[12.92 → 18.56] covering for me there i was almost going to give away our secret yeah i like your outfit by the
[18.56 → 23.70] way i like your outfit i think how did you get like how are these straight, straight like it
[23.70 → 29.26] looks like it minor curly didn't you get curly ones no, no i store my curly ones somewhere else
[29.26 → 40.32] oh my god oh wow okay cool someone did actually link it i was like what no I'm I'm wearing a
[40.32 → 45.32] completely different wig from you that's why mine looks different this is a leftover from that thing
[45.32 → 50.76] we did with uh josh from fractal on the and the hair is getting in my mouth
[50.76 → 55.70] i knew the pink one was as long as the curly hair doesn't but i know like the straight
[55.70 → 60.58] coloured hair oh that's part of the pink one oh really i didn't even know that yeah it has like
[60.58 → 69.32] uh rainbow bangs yep that's pretty cool rainbow bangs my friend rainbow bangs all right so let's
[69.32 → 74.14] drop some random stuff before you get going really buy you some extra time oh can we do the folding
[74.14 → 78.66] team update that's exactly what i was going to do yeah let's do the folding team update so the folding
[78.66 → 88.36] team is now 26 in the whole freaking world that's awesome anyway we are among top 10 for active
[88.36 → 93.56] folding teams so some of those teams don't have active members any more um, and we are among the top
[93.56 → 98.96] 10 uh the highest point producing teams for all of our members together my members are always the most active
[98.96 → 101.54] consistently putting out
[101.54 → 108.58] 10 million points per day or PPD a lot of new members have been signing up in the last couple
[108.58 → 116.20] months i suggest you do as well um and i don't know who put this in there, but folding hardware can
[116.20 → 122.34] double as whole home heating so if you want to do the opposite of whole room water cooling uh
[122.34 → 129.38] whole room heating buy computers fill your room with them and run them 100 all the time maybe someone
[129.38 → 133.26] who's trying to like to become an engineering student should convince their parents that they need a
[133.26 → 137.54] bunch of computers and a bunch of like copper tubing and stuff and recreate home room water
[137.54 → 142.88] cooling in their house using folding machines for the line of seconds folding team yeah no i mean we
[142.88 → 147.66] don't actually necessarily recommend that but what we do recommend is staying tuned for the rest of the
[147.66 → 154.28] show we got lots of good stuff for you guys there's some htc1 m9 um actually some pretty cool news
[154.28 → 161.64] coming about that we're also getting a much, much clearer idea of what the r9 390x is going to look
[161.64 → 171.14] like in its final form what else we got i have no idea oh we have uh Microsoft is not necessarily
[171.14 → 176.88] free for pirates um Windows 10 is what i think you're trying to say yeah Windows 10 is not necessarily
[176.88 → 180.76] free for pirates which is not too surprising at all we'll talk about that more later on and there
[180.76 → 187.20] was a Japanese supercomputer that was able to simulate one second of brain activity wow that's
[187.20 → 192.78] actually in a lot more than one second right, but they calculated the total that's still cool yes
[192.78 → 202.24] wait what why is this no go there we go we're ready to do this
[202.24 → 206.76] not right they can't see i wish that was on screen
[206.76 → 218.52] what thing oh yeah no, no don't worry i got this okay so uh sponsors today lynda.com
[218.52 → 225.20] mass drop why do these look completely different
[225.20 → 235.40] someone's getting fired that's it and i fix it which looks like the lynda.com one but not like
[235.40 → 242.44] the mass drop one because whatever apparently all right I'm not getting fired this time i didn't make
[242.44 → 247.72] those you can still get fired that's true yeah you can get fired for showing up at work looking like
[247.72 → 254.24] some kind of like you yeah looking like me yeah i mean think about it, we say not as we do I'm sure
[254.24 → 261.56] that friendships have broken up over wearing the same outfit probably yeah so it's not identical my
[261.56 → 266.50] little poofs are different colours that's true my poofs are uh are green, and the top ones are both blue
[266.50 → 269.84] yeah the top ones are both blue let's pull up this is really awkward
[269.84 → 279.72] okay let's just try and have a serious show okay, okay like let's try, and you know do a good job for
[279.72 → 285.30] our viewers of like yeah okay, so this first topic was posted by ah Ming and the original article here
[285.30 → 292.56] is from fandroid.com I'm going to go ahead and fire this baby up uh speaking of professionalism i have
[292.56 → 299.50] definitely not plugged my HDMI cable in here no that's that's a good thing so i have no idea if
[299.50 → 305.74] this is going to work I'm all about doing it live all right doing it right before your eyes
[305.74 → 312.64] oh okay oh did you hear that uh some major YouTuber i think she has like four million subscribers she
[312.64 → 319.06] does unboxing of toys was a former porn star yeah that's cool so that's the thing that's why she uh
[319.06 → 326.08] never appears on camera, but people put two and two together the ex-wife of her current husband or
[326.08 → 332.28] something confirmed it and was like yep that was her alias there you go well that lady's a jerk
[332.28 → 339.40] well it was already like everyone knew so yeah she officially confirmed she did confirm it
[339.40 → 343.92] so it's still kind of a like kind of a donkey move yeah so let's go ahead and oh look at that it worked
[343.92 → 354.12] first try that's amazing all right so check this out every htc1 m9 owner to get one get out of jail
[354.12 → 363.26] free card one free replacement for water damage cracked screen or switching carriers that is so
[363.26 → 369.44] cool because even if you know not every phone can be unlocked for every carrier and not every
[369.44 → 375.54] particular you know skew can have every frequency support or whatever else the case may be HTC is
[375.54 → 381.38] basically going yeah look for the lifetime of this phone you get to screw up once you get to go oh you
[381.38 → 385.92] know what I'm with Verizon, and it sucks or I'm with AT&T, and it sucks i want to try something else
[385.92 → 393.56] boom you get a replacement phone now this is uh definitely an improvement because i can tell you
[393.56 → 398.48] guys that i remember i talked about this on my show and i meant to follow this up back when i r made my
[398.48 → 403.68] one m8 i did so as a customer yeah and i told you guys that i was going to follow up and let you know
[403.68 → 409.84] how it goes because there was a problem with the main camera lens that it was like cracked for no
[409.84 → 414.76] reason like the rest of the phone was pristine like something leaned against it in my pocket it
[414.76 → 419.66] was cracked like i looked at it suddenly i was like how is this cracked um, and it is an issue that
[419.66 → 424.22] other people have had with the phone so i tried to go through the RMA process as a normal customer
[424.22 → 429.04] and they ended up rejecting me they ended up saying that it wasn't covered they wanted to charge me a
[429.04 → 433.64] bunch of money i ended up having to go through my press contact in order to get that taken care of
[433.64 → 442.02] so not cool which is not that cool so for me to CTC stepping up their warranty game is a good on
[442.02 → 447.34] them for improving something that i didn't have a great experience with them with in the past and b
[447.34 → 453.28] this is great for putting pressure on the other guys because a lot of the time products that have
[453.28 → 460.80] a lot of margin have a lot of margin because they expect a lot of they expect a lot of returns or a lot
[460.80 → 466.20] of waste like you know why is it that they can afford if someone in like if your kid in McDonald's
[466.20 → 471.24] drops their ice cream cone on the floor like the second you hand it to them does McDonald's make you
[471.24 → 477.10] buy a new one no, no no man they give you they give you a new one and if you have a lot of margin you can
[477.10 → 482.06] afford to do that kind of thing and flagship phones are getting to the point where compared to
[482.06 → 488.04] entry-level phones they've got a lot of margin and from time to time they can probably afford to
[488.04 → 493.84] repair that refurbish it do something with it and then get you a new one so pretty cool it's only
[493.84 → 499.88] within the first 12 months after you buy it and this is cool they get you the new one overnight
[499.88 → 505.16] as long as you're willing to pre-authorize 300 bucks on your credit card just to prevent fraud
[505.16 → 513.46] to prevent people from just being like uh yeah so um i need like my new one and then yeah i didn't send
[513.46 → 518.46] the old one don't worry about it, i got two now peace bro yeah so they can charge you a few hundred
[518.46 → 524.40] bucks if you do that to make that not a very profitable proposition right so um i get a bit
[524.40 → 528.10] gee what else is there all it takes is a call to their support line apparently that's that's freaking
[528.10 → 532.52] cool what else is there to say i like how it has a name too it's called uh-oh protection
[532.52 → 537.86] okay uh and like that might not seem i didn't know that first that's funny um but like that's
[537.86 → 542.12] actually kind of nice because you can phone them up and be like instead of being like i need that thing
[542.12 → 546.94] where i get that stuff for free i need Sophie protection yeah you can be like i need uh-oh
[546.94 → 551.86] protection, and they're like oh okay like it's it simplifies the communication process and i actually
[551.86 → 555.56] do like that i think that's going to sell a lot of phones i think that's going to help them a lot like
[555.56 → 562.80] if you're standing in the store, and you're like yeah Galaxy S6 or uh one m9 one of them i literally
[562.80 → 566.94] get a free replacement if i screw it up i mean this is basically Apple Care for free and if you want
[566.94 → 571.22] to go for like the companies that have your back idea you can get like a T-Mobile sim
[571.22 → 579.54] and m9 and like in most cases you're just fine this is the itchiest thing i am going crazy holy
[579.54 → 587.72] crap, but you know what these guys contributed to our new office campaign they deserve to have us sit
[587.72 → 593.44] through this when show in this incredibly stinky hot room yeah in these clown outfits yeah for them
[593.44 → 597.48] the greatest part is we were both handed these outfits like five ten minutes ago oh i knew they
[597.48 → 601.68] were here so i picked them up i could have told you oh yeah they were just in the packaging yeah
[601.68 → 605.46] yes we didn't wash any of this oh my head's like burning oh
[605.46 → 612.96] burning head all right so uh you should get that lifted they have clinics for that all right so
[612.96 → 621.00] lets uh we're getting a lot more details about the r9 390x this is posted by me down you on the
[621.00 → 626.16] forum can I help you chat said you guys needed a HDMI table who is a no the other one joke what do you what
[626.16 → 636.52] you need this he needs apparently not this the other one yeah wow, thanks nick you tried okay so uh
[636.52 → 641.34] this original article here is from techpowerup.com do you want to go ahead and throw that in the uh
[641.34 → 650.88] throw that in the twitch chat more radon r9 390x specs leak we are expecting it to be close to 70
[650.88 → 658.52] percent faster than the r9 290x this is perfect news for AMD based on that we've seen the
[658.52 → 665.88] performance of the GTX titan x NVIDIA has tipped their hand effectively and the GTX titan x is fast
[665.88 → 673.58] but it's not going to be the same kind of butt kicking difference in performance that we have seen
[673.58 → 680.60] in the past this is looking like something that could be an extremely close race and rumoured pricing
[680.60 → 687.00] that I've seen for the 390x at least the rumoured air cooled one there's actually another rumour that
[687.00 → 692.00] there's going to be both an air cooled version and a more extreme clock liquid cooled version but the
[692.00 → 697.70] rumour is that the air cooled version will be significantly less expensive than the GTX titan
[697.70 → 703.98] x, and you know the thing about the GTX titan x is that you say the same letter twice, and it drives
[703.98 → 709.92] me insane oh no that too GTX titan x they're kind of run out of cool letters what's the next one
[709.92 → 716.10] going to be like the titan j GTX powered z edition 24 noes because they already have a z they have a titan z
[716.10 → 721.28] so they got z and x powered z are there any other cool letters they have to start doing more tis
[721.28 → 725.86] ti they have a ti they have to come up with something but no they can roll them
[725.86 → 733.04] titan x ti yeah yeah let me just put big wheels on it all right so the thing about the titan x that
[733.04 → 741.46] no one really seems to be talking about is the way that NVIDIA kind of gradually sort of
[741.46 → 749.68] did this uh did this thing where the original titan the justification for the thousand dollar
[749.68 → 755.02] gaming card like how this card should realistically be the 980 um no, no that's a whole other discussion
[755.02 → 762.68] okay so the GTX titan the original justification for that unprecedented 999 price point i shouldn't
[762.68 → 766.82] say completely unprecedented because the 8800 ultra was right up around that mark i think it was around
[766.82 → 773.04] 900, but that was like uh that was like uh like a that was more of a bin of a card that was available
[773.04 → 780.36] at a lower price whereas titan and titan x have been the only card available with that tier of GPU
[780.36 → 786.30] at their launch, and it took ages for the 780 ti to come out last time around so titan the way they
[786.30 → 791.98] justified this thousand dollar graphics card was oh yeah we've got like all these like glam shots and
[791.98 → 797.30] like you know we've got this like green logo on the top of it, and it looks all gamers but no, no this
[797.30 → 802.28] is like a Cuba developer card and like it's for like rendering and stuff because it's got you know
[802.28 → 810.18] full double precision performance remember that was a big pitch titan okay titan x i was like hold
[810.18 → 816.60] up titan x has no such thing so in the two years in between these cards NVIDIA has gone from feeling
[816.60 → 822.10] like they have to justify a thousand dollar gaming card to feeling like a thousand dollar gaming card
[822.10 → 827.88] is just okay and that's just well that's our top end gaming card now so it's fascinating to see
[827.88 → 833.70] that and I'll be I'll be equally interested to see if AMD follows suit or if they go right for the
[833.70 → 840.66] titan x's jugular and release 390x significantly cheaper with similar performance now with that said
[840.66 → 847.98] titan x runs hot but 390x i will be floored apparently one of us is hitting the table fairly
[847.98 → 858.70] frequently i think it's me i will be floored if the is they uh sorry if the 390x is more uh uses up
[858.70 → 865.22] less power than the 290x yeah so titan x might still come ahead in terms of performance per watt
[865.22 → 871.42] but raw performance wise we could be looking at a close race and people care more about raw
[871.42 → 878.00] performance and g-sync was a big feature that could have sold me an NVIDIA card over an AMD card up
[878.00 → 884.46] until very recently and free sync is now here with that said my only experience with free sync so far
[884.46 → 891.42] hasn't been great did I tell you about it no okay uh is the embargo up i think so i think other people's
[891.42 → 898.24] reviews are up yeah yeah yeah i saw the pc per review so i have a 34 um 67 that's LG's 2560
[898.24 → 906.98] by 1080 ultra-wide free sync monitors and the issue with it is that it's free sync um variable refresh
[906.98 → 917.04] rate window is only from 48 hertz to 75 hertz so it only has like what is that like a 27 hertz
[917.04 → 925.38] window a 27 hertz window where it both prevents tearing and doesn't stutter and and and the refresh
[925.38 → 931.82] rate varies so if you fall below that you're going to see the same stutter nonsense that like the
[931.82 → 937.76] same choppiness that you'd see without variable refresh rate yeah and falling below 48 frames per
[937.76 → 943.72] second is the kind of thing that happens even in a game where you're averaging like 60 fps when something
[943.72 → 949.18] intensive happens and those are the times when you really feel that stutter anyway so the effectiveness
[949.18 → 953.98] for me was not very good and then the top line performance so if you were going to say okay well
[953.98 → 959.48] then I'll just have my game target like I'm going to run like way over 48 fps so i never dip well your top
[959.48 → 967.36] line is 75 hertz so you're just kind of like like like what the pitch with g-sync was that you can use
[967.36 → 973.02] more conservative settings and still get a playable smooth gameplay experience that's not the experience i had
[973.02 → 978.50] with that monitor with that said i hopefully i haven't heard 100 back from AMD yet but i hopefully
[978.50 → 985.68] have another free sync monitor coming soon that has a 40 hertz to 144 hertz window where I'll be able to
[985.68 → 990.96] much more comfortably game within that window now the cool thing about free sync is that it does support
[990.96 → 998.92] v-sync on and v-sync off so you can actually choose if your frame rate goes above the maximum refresh rate
[998.92 → 1004.60] of your monitor you can get that extra or that that that slight reduction in input latency that you
[1004.60 → 1011.42] get from higher frame rates um, but you'll have to deal with tearing once we get perfect examples
[1011.42 → 1016.54] of both sides it would be an interesting thing to do like i know you're doing your like single one
[1016.54 → 1021.24] comparison whatnot but a side-by-side comparison i would love to i think that would be awesome i think
[1021.24 → 1026.98] something like Ben q's free sync monitor the 40 to 144 versus the rogue swift yeah it would be a perfect
[1026.98 → 1030.10] example there you go that'd be really cool we got to do something like that maybe when you're back
[1030.10 → 1033.84] we do have a couple more things about 390x but yeah we should do that when I'm back i think we'll
[1033.84 → 1042.78] have both by than um so a couple of things uh blah blah blah oh yeah it's apparently going to have a 40 96
[1042.78 → 1049.64] bit wide HBM memory bus with up to 8 gigs of ram clocked at 1.25 gigahertz so we are talking
[1049.64 → 1056.58] way more memory bandwidth than GTX titan x completely new memory technology
[1056.58 → 1063.14] and uh AMD claims it will be uh claims single precision floating point performance figure of
[1063.14 → 1070.28] 8.6 teraflops the thing looks like an absolute beast the bad news is that AMD isn't rumoured to
[1070.28 → 1075.24] have anything else to flesh out their lineup and the rumour that the last rumour i heard is that a lot
[1075.24 → 1082.62] of the other 300 series cards are going to be rebadges of existing 200 series cards, so there's that
[1082.62 → 1087.50] at least they've got something and the one at the top end kind of often I'll see i don't know
[1087.50 → 1091.76] how true this is anymore but at least back in the day when i was getting people to try to get into
[1091.76 → 1096.34] computers I'd see people find and like this is why it's very unsurprising that our videos on crazy
[1096.34 → 1102.24] titan cards get a bunch of views people will find like oh that's the super awesome card that i want
[1102.24 → 1108.72] now I'll go as similar as i can but in my price range yep so if they make the 390x that kicks freaking
[1108.72 → 1112.84] but they might still sell more AMD cards regardless well there's so much stuff that's like that whether
[1112.84 → 1119.46] it's motorcycles or cars or almost anything it's its a brand image right like uh for example the
[1119.46 → 1125.80] the house we're in right now is um a morning star or something like that like it's a reputable builder
[1125.80 → 1131.62] and uh when we were buying it like that was a selling point it's a morning star home the inspection
[1131.62 → 1137.60] that we had done because we're not idiots, and we get inspections done um the inspection that we had done
[1137.60 → 1143.26] actually revealed a ton of problems with it um most of which obviously weren't a big enough issue for
[1143.26 → 1149.28] us to not go ahead and yeah you know be here filming videos all the time but reveal a bunch
[1149.28 → 1154.24] of problems with it because that's the thing is a brand is just a brand that actually has nothing to
[1154.24 → 1158.12] do with how good that individual product is you should rate it on a product or product, but that is
[1158.12 → 1164.08] how so many people buy and even yourself even knowing better have you ever done it yeah I've done it
[1164.08 → 1169.54] yeah I'll walk into Home Depot I'll be like oh i heard Bosch is good i own a bunch of husky
[1169.54 → 1174.84] products so I'll like i had to buy i had to buy a hammer and a level the other day because I've
[1174.84 → 1179.98] always used my dad's and i don't live at home anymore so it was like oh buying tools sucks hey
[1179.98 → 1185.20] it does, but it's fun it does and like I've been borrowing stuff and I'm trying to like return it
[1185.20 → 1190.02] so I'll give him stuff back and then be like oh crap that means i have to go get one now so like i had
[1190.02 → 1194.44] a hammer and a level from him for years and then i had three years wow you're a terrible son seriously
[1194.44 → 1198.52] and then i was like okay i should return this and i give it back and then i have to buy one like the
[1198.52 → 1202.32] next freaking week um so i go to the store I'm like i don't know what to get and i felt a whole
[1202.32 → 1206.98] bunch of them and eventually like it came down to a few but i was like eh it's like three it's like
[1206.98 → 1211.94] three extra dollars yeah it feels better in my hand it feels good i have a lot of their products
[1211.94 → 1216.58] already it'll probably be fine yep might not even actually be better there you go and tools are
[1216.58 → 1221.34] tools are like a hilarious one because it's always like lifetime warranty built tough who has
[1221.34 → 1226.90] ever claimed warranty on a hammer yeah when a hammer dies you're probably it's probably because
[1226.90 → 1231.20] you're using it, and you need one now so you go buy one and then who's going to get around to
[1231.20 → 1236.32] warrantying a nine dollar hammer not me it costs nine dollars to ship something in Canada so unless
[1236.32 → 1241.08] they're just kind of always wanted to make like a tool review channel but i don't know if people would
[1241.08 → 1246.32] actually watch it i it was one of the things that i thought about with like Linus media group
[1246.32 → 1251.16] earlier on and if i knew anything about tools it might have happened right all right lets uh let's
[1251.16 → 1254.88] move on this one was posted by goodbyes yeah i couldn't do it is would have to be someone that
[1254.88 → 1262.14] last one was from me down you, so this one's from goodbyes Microsoft clarifies the whole Windows 10
[1262.14 → 1268.66] upgrades will be free for pirated Windows 7 and Windows 8 as well, so the original article here is
[1268.66 → 1276.26] from neowin.net I'm going to go ahead and pull this up and have you posted that in the chat so upgrade
[1276.26 → 1283.52] to Windows 10 on pirated versions won't get you a valid license with it's its it's it is technically
[1283.52 → 1290.98] the upgrade process is free yes they didn't lie you can upgrade it just doesn't change your license
[1290.98 → 1298.10] conditions yes so you're still on a pirated version um what that means exactly doesn't appear to be 100
[1298.10 → 1305.76] clear yet so we don't know if you know Microsoft obviously knows who's doing what so we don't know
[1305.76 → 1310.64] if all of a sudden we're going to be allowed to change our desktop backgrounds on pirated copies
[1310.64 → 1316.98] or if we're going to be able to do this or be able to do that but uh pirates can rest assured that they
[1316.98 → 1322.28] will get an upgrade to Windows 10 with that said i don't think pirates were generally concerned about
[1322.28 → 1326.78] getting an upgrade from Microsoft to Windows 10 anyway so i don't really i don't really see the
[1326.78 → 1333.64] point yeah of this i actually think in my theorizing brain yeah that they are going to do
[1333.64 → 1338.82] more limiting on Windows 10 for people that have non-genuine licenses and what i think they're trying
[1338.82 → 1343.92] to do is get people off of the earlier ones where there's essentially no limiting other than like
[1343.92 → 1348.26] making your desktop and then crack it down and then crack down on people so trying to get people
[1348.26 → 1353.76] to voluntarily upgrade so that they can crack down on them yeah i think that's what's happening
[1353.76 → 1360.26] i don't know that very interesting it would make sense to me, i don't know we're going to have a lot of
[1360.26 → 1366.20] machines to upgrade to Windows 10 because we didn't go Windows 8 on a lot of our computers like we got a
[1366.20 → 1370.70] lot of people commenting oh you guys are running Windows 7 on whether it's a test bench or whether it's
[1370.70 → 1376.32] my machine like yeah I'm running Windows 7 because I'm not spending a hundred dollars on Windows 8
[1376.32 → 1381.58] for a workstation that's stupid but Windows 10 does look like it's going to be a pretty compelling
[1381.58 → 1390.24] upgrade even if just for the better support for uh UI and text scaling yeah um so we're potentially
[1390.24 → 1395.14] moving to all 4k monitors on our editing workstations that's something we're working on
[1395.14 → 1401.48] with LG right now um so everyone's going to need Windows 10 kind of regardless in order to have a
[1401.48 → 1406.18] decent computer experience like we were kind of able to get away with like Windows 7 benchmarking
[1406.18 → 1410.48] for a long time yeah but probably going to have to move that up we'll have to absolutely because
[1410.48 → 1416.06] Windows 10 is going to be the only one with direct x 12 support yeah so i thought Windows 7 was going
[1416.06 → 1421.96] to be direct x 12 nope get ready for the growing pains all right so a Japanese supercomputer has
[1421.96 → 1429.40] simulated one second of brain activity this was posted by genres in the forum so let's go ahead and
[1429.40 → 1433.84] you didn't know that did you they had said at one point in time that it's coming to Windows 7 yeah now
[1433.84 → 1439.28] they're saying blah blah blah it would require a complete like reworking of this or that or whatever
[1439.28 → 1445.60] yeah so uh nope forget it uh so supercomputer models one second of human brain activity the most accurate
[1445.60 → 1453.24] simulation of the human brain ever has been carried out but a single seconds worth of activity took one
[1453.24 → 1464.54] of the largest supercomputers 40 minutes to calculate with 705 024 cores and 1.4 petabytes of ram
[1464.54 → 1475.34] wait till your phone can do that i know right sick or wait till that thing that's with you can do that
[1475.34 → 1481.18] okay so let's let's let's do it let's do a let's do some quick number crunching here so 40 minutes
[1481.18 → 1492.24] times 60 is uh 2400 seconds okay so 2400 what's like root 2400 i don't remember how to do that on a
[1492.24 → 1499.80] calculator okay so 48 times so root 2400 hold on a second no no no i want the exponential root
[1499.80 → 1503.90] yeah why are you doing this can you help me what are you trying to calculate okay Moore's law
[1503.90 → 1508.88] doubling of transistors i want to know how long until we can do this in real time
[1508.88 → 1515.52] whatever someone in twitch will do the math and will make me feel dumb and then I'll be able to tell
[1515.52 → 1521.72] you guys and that's how that will work so how far are we away from AI probably that far
[1521.72 → 1527.98] crazy hey that's that's pretty far actually still it is pretty far still, but it's its within scope
[1527.98 → 1536.08] um researchers used the k computer in Japan uh to replicate a network consisting of 1.73 billion
[1536.08 → 1543.96] nerve cells connected by 10.4 trillion synapses the achievement offers neuroscientists a glimpse of
[1543.96 → 1549.76] what can be achieved by using next generation computers so-called example computing and uh so
[1549.76 → 1554.56] example computers are those which can carry out a quintillion floating point operations per second
[1554.56 → 1560.00] an important milestone as is thought to be the same power as a human brain and therefore opens the
[1560.00 → 1567.24] door to potential real-time simulation of the organ's activity intel has said that it aims to have
[1567.24 → 1569.38] such a machine in operation by 2018
[1569.38 → 1574.72] i don't think that it won't be your phone
[1574.72 → 1579.82] it'll be no i know but i don't think that lines up with the Moore's lock no it doesn't at all actually
[1579.82 → 1585.26] no so then the k computer is technically not brand new either yeah the k computer is not the fastest
[1585.26 → 1588.92] supercomputer no by any it's not the fastest supercomputer, and it's definitely not brand new
[1588.92 → 1596.52] yeah so uh who that's actually pretty crazy that is also a little scary yeah we should segue from
[1596.52 → 1602.32] crazy and sky that could be coming in our lifetime right we should segue from crazy and scary to
[1602.32 → 1609.04] where the hell is it i don't know what you're talking about musk confirms tesla will never make an
[1609.04 → 1613.66] undrivable car oh this won't even be that big of a segment but i wanted to bring this up
[1613.66 → 1618.32] posted by pop man on the forum did you post that on twitch already i will right now all right uh tesla
[1618.32 → 1626.42] strongly favours people being able to drive their cars if they want um or like a manual takeover let
[1626.42 → 1632.48] me get back over the notes here real quick um however self-driving cars may become safer than human
[1632.48 → 1638.10] driven cars and the public may actually demand to outlaw human driven cars at some point in time
[1638.10 → 1644.32] and he's a little worried about that um because he is very famously kind of scared of the whole AI
[1644.32 → 1649.66] takeover thing right which is not surprising and being able to fully simulate a human brain in 2018
[1649.66 → 1658.10] yeah i don't know I'm super excited having the power to do it because there's still a lot more that
[1658.10 → 1662.12] needs to be done even once we have the computing power, but that is true that's a good even so i mean
[1662.12 → 1669.50] i don't think a self-driving car ever needs to have AI i think a self-driving car, but they super will
[1669.50 → 1675.28] can always be pretty dumb, but they totally will yeah they'll need certain because it'll be able to
[1675.28 → 1680.30] react with you differently, and you're going to have driving cars with Siri built into it and maybe
[1680.30 → 1685.10] Siri's the one that's actually driving because it's managing the maps application and maybe Siri is
[1685.10 → 1691.12] the one that ends up taking over the world maybe it already has a name Siri net
[1691.12 → 1695.08] super serious yeah
[1695.08 → 1701.90] okay oh my god apple should make a cereal called cereal
[1701.90 → 1704.72] why would apple make cereal
[1704.72 → 1711.20] well okay maybe they shouldn't do that, but they should make one thing after another
[1711.20 → 1721.66] because then they're all right so Samsung's round smartwatch speaking of making one thing
[1721.66 → 1728.46] after another with no discernible strategy uh Samsung's round smartwatch is coming
[1728.46 → 1733.72] uh this was posted by nine shadow on the forum I'm going to go ahead and pop this up
[1733.72 → 1740.42] and uh if this seems like a reaction to other round smartwatches then that's probably what it is i
[1740.42 → 1745.24] think there were better i thought there were better pictures of this yeah like that one what
[1745.24 → 1751.74] link is that in Linus tikis website bro oh okay well correct bro you get wrecked bro
[1751.74 → 1759.88] whatever bro got like uh this thing is running crazy
[1759.88 → 1767.16] by the way we should actually no we shouldn't, I'll take it back forget about it don't worry about it
[1767.16 → 1771.32] nope okay it's cool i was going to say the front page thing, but they can't click on it, i don't think
[1771.32 → 1776.58] anyway right so don't worry about it okay, okay fine i give up I'm I'm loading up I'm loading up
[1776.58 → 1782.98] i was trying to i was trying to refer to the site that it came from rather than we can give them
[1782.98 → 1791.00] props yeah sure all right so that is what it looks like it will look like um yeah so if that looks
[1791.00 → 1795.76] similar to another round smartwatch then i guess that probably makes sense because there's only so many
[1795.76 → 1802.08] things you can do with an LCD display and a metal band around it is does have a crown so that's uh
[1802.08 → 1807.56] that's definitely different from the Moto 360 um it also has a button you mean like yeah apparently
[1807.56 → 1814.34] the camera is coming back so I'm not sure if that's confirmed or a rumour yet i honestly I've done very
[1814.34 → 1820.12] little prep on the dock this week i filmed an unbelievable number of videos this week um and
[1820.12 → 1827.00] including a build guide i was here at the office until after 1 a.m last night working on that so
[1827.00 → 1832.62] our sub-zero build guide is in the editing queue right now I'm extremely excited about that anyway
[1832.62 → 1839.66] well this is cool it'll have a rotating bezel ring so if you wanted to use it for navigation or something
[1839.66 → 1845.06] then like that's super cool i don't see people replacing their submariners with this you know
[1845.06 → 1850.28] instantly and so the kinds of people who would want navigation on their wrist might be the kinds
[1850.28 → 1855.24] of people who would like submariners and like i don't I don't know that that particular navigation
[1855.24 → 1859.40] rotating dial thing is going to sell anyone on it, but that's kind of cool i still think we need the
[1859.40 → 1864.04] watch that i proposed a long time ago which is like those exact watches that we're talking about
[1864.04 → 1868.38] with a transparent display on the top yes yeah so that even if you don't charge it for a month it just
[1868.38 → 1871.92] doesn't matter but if you're like i kind of want to be able to use the smartwatch just plug it in
[1871.92 → 1875.88] overnight, and you're good the stupid thing is that that's the most obvious idea ever and whoever
[1875.88 → 1881.26] finally does it first is going to be hailed as some kind of like visionary genius, and it'll be
[1881.26 → 1888.14] like one of the like the the the real uh the real watch brands yeah is going to do it
[1888.14 → 1893.70] and then all the watch aficionados who have been calling smartwatches stupid are going to be like
[1893.70 → 1897.96] well we were just waiting for someone to do it right because they have that brand loyalty it's
[1897.96 → 1901.74] going to have nothing to do with the actual technology yep um if this one's going to be
[1901.74 → 1908.20] called the orbit and can be used on a band a clip a keychain or a bracelet no word on pricing i did get
[1908.20 → 1912.52] word from pebble i am not getting a pebble steel but i think I'm getting a regular pebble time or
[1912.52 → 1921.90] pebble time steel or steel time or whatever anyway pebble steel time um microsoft Windows 10
[1921.90 → 1928.68] on room for android phones, so this is posted by aiming on the forum the original article here is
[1928.68 → 1933.72] from trusted reviews as far as i can tell today everything is posted by aiming yeah aiming is on
[1933.72 → 1940.76] a roll this week um so Microsoft wants to put Windows 10 on your android phone this particular
[1940.76 → 1945.90] picture here happens to be a just regular Windows 10 phone that's also available on android flavours the
[1945.90 → 1952.44] one and eight and happens to be the uh and that also happens to be the uh the source of a lot of
[1952.44 → 1960.34] disgruntled viewers who were like super upset at me for saying that Windows phone has like no place
[1960.34 → 1968.64] on a high-end phone um, so hopefully that isn't going to be true anymore but at any rate um for some
[1968.64 → 1974.12] reason if you wanted to put windows maybe Windows phone 10 will be like way better or i shouldn't call
[1974.12 → 1978.56] it Windows phone 10 because it's Windows 10 but like the phone version will be like way better or
[1978.56 → 1983.62] something, so the official statement is through a new program with zoo mi inc one of the top smartphone
[1983.62 → 1988.72] distributors in the world a select group of mi4 power users will be invited to help test Windows 10
[1988.72 → 1993.64] and contribute to its future release later this year they'll have the opportunity to download the
[1993.64 → 1998.76] Windows 10 technical preview install it and provide their feedback to Microsoft so it'll effectively
[1998.76 → 2004.00] override android turning it into a Windows 10 device i don't know how it's done
[2004.00 → 2007.58] on mobile but i and i don't know if this is still a thing but i know for a while there
[2007.58 → 2015.86] uh Windows 10 at least for desktop had a pretty hardcore keylogger in it so might want to look
[2015.86 → 2021.62] into the privacy stuff before you install this on your phone because it's like i understand the
[2021.62 → 2025.52] reason why they have if it's because they're trying to test things so they kind of want to know what
[2025.52 → 2029.70] you're doing with the device, and they're not hiding it they tell you about it um but a lot of people
[2029.70 → 2036.60] kind of just spam next like me um so you might not notice if you're going to put it on your phone
[2036.60 → 2039.84] they might be listening to a little bit more than what you're doing on your computer i don't know
[2039.84 → 2045.82] you might want to just look into that so just be vigilant be wary yeah be excellent to each other
[2045.82 → 2049.58] speaking of being excellent to each other we should be excellent to our sponsors
[2049.58 → 2057.14] lynda.com is the first sponsor of today's Sancho this is my sponsor voice it's very different from
[2057.14 → 2061.84] my regular voice because it's much more obnoxious yeah you wouldn't have thought it possibly would
[2061.84 → 2066.36] you no anyway lynda.com is used by millions of people around the world think about that
[2066.36 → 2072.64] millions of people that's a lot of people that's like more than one million yeah and at least two
[2072.64 → 2077.38] million it's potentially a number of millions yeahs it could be any number of millions we actually
[2077.38 → 2082.52] don't know they have more than 3 000 courses available with topics like web development photography
[2082.52 → 2088.04] visual design and business, and they offer software training so lynda.com is not just for like young
[2088.04 → 2093.02] people looking to start their career and like learn something new it's also great for developing and
[2093.02 → 2097.94] like kind of catching up on skills that have sort of caught you by surprise over the last little bit
[2097.94 → 2102.52] so while you guys might already have a lynda.com subscription, or maybe you don't feel like you need
[2102.52 → 2108.06] one what about your parents who don't know how to use word or excel or whatever else lynda.com
[2108.06 → 2114.02] has experts teaching you in a friendly manner at your own pace and is super cool it's also affordable
[2114.02 → 2118.54] and if you're worried about whether the price is actually worth it for you, they offer a 10-day free
[2118.54 → 2125.72] trial by heading over to lynda.com slash wan show so you can go ahead and try it out find if it's
[2125.72 → 2132.44] right for you and then start learning today we have another sponsor today and i don't know who it is
[2132.44 → 2138.66] because i went ahead and i scrolled somewhere else in the thing here oh, oh cool oh our second sponsor
[2138.66 → 2144.40] today is Bastrop we like Bastrop except that they keep stealing my money well it's not really stealing
[2144.40 → 2151.58] they just they have deals on their master thank you can you just it's not really stealing if they
[2151.58 → 2155.68] just have deals on their site and then i willingly give them my credit card information that's like
[2155.68 → 2162.12] actually not stealing at all opposite right so buying things well anyway whatever we
[2162.12 → 2170.70] have a feature drop today these are the audio technical MSR 7s and now they're being worn by a
[2170.70 → 2175.88] clown yay wow noise isolation on these is actually excellent this might be the only time that they're
[2175.88 → 2181.58] worn by a clown all right this is an over-the-ear closed-back headphone it's got 45 millimetre true
[2181.58 → 2186.90] motion drivers it's available in black or gunmetal and Bastrop is offering a special bundle with the
[2186.90 → 2192.56] Antone mod mic and a headphone stand that's pretty cool that is a pretty cool that's a pretty good deal
[2192.56 → 2197.86] pretty BA gaming setup anyway the point is whether you're interested in these headphones or not Bastrop
[2197.86 → 2203.90] has lots of cool stuff so if you head over to draw.ps slash wan show you can check i know right
[2203.90 → 2210.84] draw.ps whatever it's here so if you head over to draw.ps slash wan show you can check them out the whole
[2210.84 → 2216.52] idea is the more people buy a given deal the lower the price goes and Bastrop works directly with
[2216.52 → 2221.64] manufacturers and distributors to make sure that the products you're buying are genuine, and they are
[2221.64 → 2227.26] the best possible deal so let's go ahead and move on to our last sponsor another one of my favourite
[2227.26 → 2232.14] sponsors it's like all the like awesome sponsors that we like use all the time here today sorry about
[2232.14 → 2239.70] that that was my bad okay so let's go ahead and drop this baby in here, so this is the fixity
[2239.70 → 2246.10] pro tech toolkit and this is like some glam b-roll that Burke shot of it oh you have one on you Luke
[2246.10 → 2252.36] oh it's yours okay well whatever the point is it has tons of hard to find bits like security Torres
[2252.36 → 2257.82] those writings that were up there a second ago it comes with an anti-static wrist strap as well as a
[2257.82 → 2265.04] variety of little pokers and plodders and prying tools i use this thing i won't say every day because
[2265.04 → 2270.84] some days i don't go to work and i don't have any personal projects that I'm working on but what i
[2270.84 → 2278.74] will say is i use this multiple times per week yes and multiple times per month i run into a situation
[2278.74 → 2283.50] where there would have been no other way for me to deal with it yeah that's more what i run into
[2283.50 → 2289.36] actually i don't use it maybe as frequently as you do, but there are probably just as many times when i
[2289.36 → 2295.08] would have to use it i literally have it in my backpack at all times yeah, so there's that so you
[2295.08 → 2300.40] guys are going to want to use offer code when show zero three to save 10 bucks on any purchase of 50
[2300.40 → 2304.82] or more from fixity they have great guides on how to fix your electronics and then conveniently
[2304.82 → 2310.20] what a racket these guys have conveniently they list all the tools you need from their web store in
[2310.20 → 2314.94] order to complete aforementioned repair the good news is that you can afford to buy yourself a bunch of
[2314.94 → 2320.60] cool tools from them fix that thing for what you would have spent and sometimes less than what
[2320.60 → 2323.74] you would have spent having someone else do it in the first place, and now you own a bunch of tools
[2323.74 → 2329.56] very often uh less than you would have spent like just completely cut out there but yeah all right so
[2329.56 → 2333.34] let's go ahead and move on to our next topic of the show here what do you get why do you keep
[2333.34 → 2338.64] holding that up should we remember we were going to talk about the oh right you talk about it yeah
[2338.64 → 2344.24] yeah yeah we're fine he's finally doing it you guys he's finally doing it
[2344.24 → 2360.30] you're red
[2360.30 → 2368.50] so it's an iPhone and i have no idea what I'm doing with it, i don't understand how this thing
[2368.50 → 2376.42] works at all it's an iPhone 5s it's a 5s okay yeah um i wasn't going to do this switch but then
[2376.42 → 2384.12] something that we're using as a back end for something super specific has an app that i like
[2384.12 → 2388.14] super need to use because i need to be able to monitor how it's working very closely over the next
[2388.14 → 2394.50] in a while, and they only have an iPhone app so i have to use the yell is hitting the twitch chat now
[2394.50 → 2403.38] r.i.p years r.i.p years well bad um so yeah i had to at least temporarily at the very least give up my
[2403.38 → 2412.14] Moto X for an iPhone 5s see how that goes for you similar sizes yeah that one's a little smaller yeah
[2412.14 → 2416.58] you may actually end up liking it after a while you have to give it like at least a month i think
[2416.58 → 2422.14] okay there's some super crazy frustrating stuff i already know one like the super cool fingerprint
[2422.14 → 2426.58] thing doesn't work at all i spent like 10 minutes trying to get my fingerprint working on it
[2426.58 → 2431.42] and every single time there would be like one line left, and it's like nope no i don't know what that
[2431.42 → 2437.82] is you have to be you have to be doing it wrong okay no seriously no it works for me every time it doesn't
[2437.82 → 2441.98] work at all i don't even know how to do it I'll help you I'll help you I'll help you i want to do it
[2441.98 → 2448.18] live, so people don't think I'm crazy okay privacy touch ID and passcode oh oh oh you got this no
[2448.18 → 2453.14] yeah privacy why would it be under privacy that's stupid what I'm kidding that makes perfect sense
[2453.14 → 2460.18] okay, okay they can't really all right don't move your finger too much okay, okay yeah well you have to
[2460.18 → 2463.82] leave it on leave it on leave it on wait it's doing the vibrate thing okay, okay it tells you when it's
[2463.82 → 2470.38] done okay yeah watch it work the first time finger moved i did not move my finger
[2470.38 → 2481.42] okay it's filling in yeah it would normally get here yeah okay uh-huh
[2481.42 → 2488.76] try a different finger this fingerprint cannot be read do you just have like unreadable fingerprints
[2488.76 → 2493.50] no they look super normal maybe try like cleaning it off and like to clean off your finger or something
[2493.50 → 2498.44] before you try to okay well I'll try it again I'm talking about you try that and I'll I'll
[2498.44 → 2502.16] do another topic in the meantime let's see if you can let's see if you can do it you keep keeping working
[2502.16 → 2506.98] on it live let them see okay so he's going to keep he's going to keep working on that in the
[2506.98 → 2511.46] meantime i actually do have some apple stuff to talk about oh this is unfortunate we actually had an
[2511.46 → 2518.32] entire separate um topic for free sync posted by sportsman on the forum um and i think we talked about
[2518.32 → 2523.68] pretty much all of this already so thanks sportsman yeah there's that thanks sportsman
[2523.68 → 2532.46] spartaman uh we've got another article posted by a nine shadow on the forum
[2532.46 → 2537.64] look you i guess they can't really see it there's like two lines left and i hold my finger and it
[2537.64 → 2542.60] fills them, and then it vibrates, and they go oh i got it no it didn't yeah know no it did adjust your grip
[2542.60 → 2546.46] now you can now you do the rest of the finger you got this bro you got this all right
[2546.46 → 2551.24] you just needed my encouragement to uh the moral support to make it to the end yeah
[2551.24 → 2556.86] uh okay
[2556.86 → 2567.54] this is from nine to five mac apple to launch android device trade-in program to encourage iPhone upgrades
[2567.54 → 2573.10] very, very interesting now this isn't the first time that apple has done some kind of upgrade
[2573.10 → 2580.16] program in fact they first introduced one um can't remember i read this article and i knew the date
[2580.16 → 2584.42] but someone who did the notes for this article didn't put it in the notes no big deal but anyway
[2584.42 → 2590.10] they did one in the past for their own devices, and they saw a big boost in sales well now they're
[2590.10 → 2598.22] offering it for blackberry and android devices so Apple retail store employees after a training program
[2598.22 → 2602.78] are going to be able to determine trade-in values for devices by considering their cosmetic
[2602.78 → 2608.90] and functional condition they will be able to transfer address book contacts from the rival
[2608.90 → 2613.12] smartphones to iPhones, but other data will have to be moved by the customer it'll be available in
[2613.12 → 2619.22] multiple countries including the United States and United Kingdom so um the existing trade-in program
[2619.22 → 2625.06] is known for its consistency and convenience, but pricing is typically not necessarily the best i think Amazon
[2625.06 → 2629.18] offers an excellent one where they do a quote over the internet, and then they send it back to you
[2629.18 → 2632.50] extremely quickly they offer you a label so you don't have to pay shipping and stuff like that
[2632.50 → 2644.80] so there you go guys very interesting that's awesome oh this is cool okay yeah so our like our new
[2644.80 → 2651.52] bros like these guys are definitely our bros because they like make cool stuff, and it's pretty cool
[2651.52 → 2658.44] 45 drives if you guys have heard of these before okay if you've heard of back blaze before uh these guys
[2658.44 → 2664.84] kind of it's a long relationship, and you can actually read about it on the 45 drives blog, but it's a long
[2664.84 → 2672.72] relationship that eventually has turned into the development of the storage pod the 45 drive for you
[2672.72 → 2678.86] storage pod one of which is actually going to be it would have been here now and i would have been able
[2678.86 → 2688.50] to like to show it to you guys if there wasn't a 100 centimetre of snow drop on the 45 drives guys
[2688.50 → 2695.92] not allowing them to ship it to us, but basically it is what it says it is a single for you rack
[2695.92 → 2703.86] mount case that holds 45 drives and is able to handle sustained speeds in excess of one gigabyte
[2703.86 → 2708.94] per second they are highly customizable they are they're actually they're sending us one that we're
[2708.94 → 2714.48] going to be deploying at our new office as a mass storage 100 plus terabyte server we have a really
[2714.48 → 2719.36] really exciting new server setup coming we're going to have multiple servers instead of just one
[2719.36 → 2726.02] thing we should do though just so that uh loony can stop having a hernia is once we get all these
[2726.02 → 2732.32] things deployed we need to post them on the 10 terabyte thread we will on the forum we will yeah we will
[2732.32 → 2738.84] we are gonna we are going to make our own thread in the forum oh that's a little the 100 terabyte thread
[2738.84 → 2745.34] oh wrecked yeah that's a 10 terabyte plus thread well we are going to make a 100 terabyte plus thread
[2745.34 → 2751.94] to coexist, and we are going to join both clubs because the way this is gonna work is we are going to have
[2751.94 → 2759.62] somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30 plus drives installed in our 45 drives rack and uh it is gonna
[2759.62 → 2764.68] be bananas now this is kind of cool they actually have a couple of other products as well that they
[2764.68 → 2772.08] just launched um so they have the 45 one that i think I've talked about a fair bit but they
[2772.08 → 2779.08] actually have a quiet one now so something that most server grade gear is not is quiet if you've ever
[2779.08 → 2785.46] fired up like a rack mount switch yeah or any kind of like especially like a 1u or a 2u server
[2785.46 → 2790.96] those things are edentulous tiny little fans in it and then just rip them at like 5 000 RP so the
[2790.96 → 2796.22] one that they originally wanted to send us until i explained that we had like probably 50 to 60
[2796.22 → 2802.56] terabytes of storage sitting on drives on a shelf in our bathroom already was the q30 here and the
[2802.56 → 2806.44] idea is that this is for like video production studios and offices they actually custom-build all
[2806.44 → 2810.96] their rigs they're more like they're actually more like a custom boutique they're more like a boutique
[2810.96 → 2817.00] system builder than like an um than like strictly speaking like uh like a storage appliance company
[2817.00 → 2822.82] I've talked to them on the phone before and then this one unfortunately this one i had no opportunity
[2822.82 → 2828.48] to get in on i didn't even know the xl60 was coming they now have a 60 drive single for you rack
[2828.48 → 2836.24] 60 redundant power drives and boot drives and 10 gigabit Ethernet can we get that one uh no
[2836.24 → 2842.84] it's like a full additional like 1500 Canadian dollars so yes, but there are bros right they're
[2842.84 → 2847.22] not yeah i know right they're not bros so they're not bump right or something i don't know they're
[2847.22 → 2852.90] not cheap, but that does include hardware so that includes like motherboard CPU ram power supply case
[2852.90 → 2860.50] does not include 10 gigabit land blah blah blah all that stuff but does not include drives so uh guys
[2860.50 → 2867.36] stay tuned because we have like a crazy setup so okay I'll tell you guys a fair bit we're hoping
[2867.36 → 2873.82] and this is not confirmed, yet we're hoping to have a purely solid state large rate array for like the
[2873.82 → 2879.22] day-to-day drive huge like a huge rate array then we're hoping to have like a similar
[2879.22 → 2885.80] sized magnetic rate array for like i mean given how fast that SSD array is going to be we could do like
[2885.80 → 2890.44] hourly backups realistically like there's no reason we can do that we're going to have iota spare
[2890.44 → 2895.72] so we could do like hourly backups to that then we're going to have the 45 drive coordinator which
[2895.72 → 2899.70] by the way is going to be customized with like our logo on the front and stuff sick yeah i know right
[2899.70 → 2906.00] so we're going to have the coordinator to archive everything else from that point on so I'm extremely
[2906.00 → 2910.80] excited about this these guys make super cool products and someone in the chat just said and
[2910.80 → 2917.64] you can't afford ac normally I'd like jump on with that and be like yeah but like no if when you run a
[2917.64 → 2921.84] company your data is extremely important yeah data is so much more important than being cool
[2921.84 → 2927.58] losing all of your data can crush your entire company yep so like would you spend ten thousand
[2927.58 → 2932.66] dollars to save your entire company yes would you spend ten thousand dollars to be a bit more
[2932.66 → 2942.22] comfortable if you're me no look at my car point proven QED sucks all right let's go ahead and
[2942.22 → 2949.14] uh oh this is crazy um this was uh the original article here was posted by actually the
[2949.14 → 2955.40] old mix cameraman linked me to this we still chat once in a while um so post on hard OCP from someone
[2955.40 → 2963.90] claiming to be an employee tiger direct closing most North American retail stores apparently all but three
[2963.90 → 2971.24] of them are excuse me all but four of them are closing so uh the post here says that uh there's lots of
[2971.24 → 2975.30] screaming yelling and tears people are in disarray especially the ones that have been with the
[2975.30 → 2982.32] company a very long time and here are some of the signs that you're going to see soon i mean you know
[2982.32 → 2988.22] what when's the last time you like were compelled to buy anything on tiger direct i didn't know they
[2988.22 → 2993.56] have retail stores okay well they don't hear but they do in Canada like they do in uh in Ontario
[2993.56 → 3001.38] i read this and was like what yeah oh yeah because they acquired comp us aback in the day
[3001.38 → 3005.48] okay i actually knew who they were yeah so they took their stores yeah, and they had their own stores
[3005.48 → 3010.56] already if i recall correctly like tiger used to be i knew who they were from like old gaming magazines
[3010.56 → 3019.84] like old pc gamers before there was like YouTube the the pc hardware margin structure does not
[3019.84 → 3027.94] support retail stores the reason that your local retail computer store exists is services yeah yeah
[3027.94 → 3035.20] services and like overcharging because you can call it overcharging if you could buy it online at Amazon
[3035.20 → 3040.50] or NCI or whatever for cheaper you could call that overcharging but what I'll say is that they're not
[3040.50 → 3045.22] overcharging if that's the margin that they have to charge in order to keep the walls up and the heat on
[3045.22 → 3051.84] in the ac on in their store so i don't know you can call that whatever you want um because there is
[3051.84 → 3056.28] not a lot of margin in this and tiger was a heavily retail-arranged business so if you look at other
[3056.28 → 3062.14] retail stores NCI for example has retail stores, but they're supported by an extremely large online
[3062.14 → 3067.78] and business to business division two extra divisions that help make those retail stores make
[3067.78 → 3074.70] sense yeah um, so this does not surprise me um you know i don't know what the answer is but it
[3074.70 → 3079.74] felt it felt like back when i was especially in the computer retailer business it really felt like
[3079.74 → 3086.74] something had to be done at some level you know whether it's like Seagate enforcing minimum pricing
[3086.74 → 3092.92] or whoever enforcing minimum pricing and a lot of the time it did exist minimum advertised price map
[3092.92 → 3097.88] price that that is a thing that exists particularly in the U.S. i think apple does it like crazy i can't
[3097.88 → 3102.36] remember if it's illegal in Canada, or it used to be and isn't anymore i don't remember map price is
[3102.36 → 3106.70] like i don't think it's technically enforceable anyway like i would sit there and i would go how
[3106.70 → 3110.90] do we fix this how do we make this sustainable business so someone other than NVIDIA and intel
[3110.90 → 3116.80] is making money in this industry um and no answer came so I'm not in the computer retailer business
[3116.80 → 3119.62] it's no longer my problem if any of this stuff sells or makes any money
[3119.62 → 3131.92] right um half-life 3 this is posted by Romeo be the best half-life 3 is apparently not likely
[3131.92 → 3139.18] um Gabe Newell in a recent interview kind of came on and was like well look i get it like you know
[3139.18 → 3147.72] story driven stuff is like good and like you know if there's like a novel series that i enjoy or a TV
[3147.72 → 3152.66] show and i want to know what happens next like that's super cool and there's a lot of anticipation
[3152.66 → 3160.06] um, but then he goes on to talk about how valve's business model and the landscape of gaming has
[3160.06 → 3165.88] changed and i think he said something i don't remember the exact quote but uh the only reason
[3165.88 → 3171.64] we'd go back and do like a super classic kind of product is if a bunch of people just
[3171.64 → 3176.46] internally at valve said they wanted to do it and had a reasonable explanation for why they wanted to
[3176.46 → 3180.40] do it, but you know if you want to do another half-life game, and you want to ignore everything
[3180.40 → 3184.16] we've learned in shipping portal 2 and in shipping all the updates on the multiplayer side
[3184.16 → 3188.58] that seems like a bad choice so we'll keep moving forward, but that doesn't necessarily
[3188.58 → 3194.54] always mean what people are worried that it might mean so does this mean like a half-life MMO or
[3194.54 → 3200.80] half-life some kind of like free-to-play like mob or like i don't know what this means maybe it means
[3200.80 → 3208.54] a novelization um maybe it means i don't know i think they're just throwing money away because of
[3208.54 → 3213.86] their corporate structure i don't think they need it they don't need it you're right but if you can learn
[3213.86 → 3219.50] from apple having ridiculous or specifically Nintendo if you can learn from Nintendo having
[3219.50 → 3224.84] a ridiculous amount of money sitting in the bank so that if something changes down the line and
[3224.84 → 3230.62] everyone's like oh my god Nintendo is totally failing they're going to be bankrupt in two days, and they're
[3230.62 → 3236.48] like oh wait they have money for 25 years it's not a bad thing it's not a bad position to be in i
[3236.48 → 3240.82] think they should push half-life but oh well like just looking at the amount of demand
[3240.82 → 3247.82] they could just release like a pretty good version like the like we tried pretty hard
[3247.82 → 3252.80] but i don't think they want to do that no I'm not saying they would and i don't think they want to
[3252.80 → 3259.48] do that but if they did, it would still be a huge smashing hit yep like and valve would go over the
[3259.48 → 3264.14] top and do it right, and then it would be ridiculously massive and make butt tons of money so basically
[3264.14 → 3271.32] the TLDR is we don't feel like that yeah we don't feel like doing it nope yeah we're making
[3271.32 → 3278.22] an awful lot of money because you sucker buy Team Fortress hats so basically yeah Team Fortress hats
[3278.22 → 3282.36] and CSGO skins they make way more off Team Fortress hats and CSGO skins than they do off stuff in the
[3282.36 → 3288.36] game yeah i mean i for all the know lord gay Ben stuff and all that kind of stuff and valve
[3288.36 → 3295.84] worshipping that goes on mostly i hope they're just a business yeah like they do things the way
[3295.84 → 3301.64] that they do them, and they have that because integrity because it works it's like there's
[3301.64 → 3306.56] that famous Gabe Newell quote don't lie to the internet because they'll catch you he didn't say
[3306.56 → 3313.62] don't lie to the internet because it's wrong like yeah let's not let's not misunderstand what valve is
[3313.62 → 3320.06] as a company they're a company they exist to ship products that are profitable for them as a company
[3320.06 → 3325.50] they don't do things out of the just like joy of you know doing things all day i mean i think that
[3325.50 → 3332.26] if it was just purely for joy they wouldn't worry about little microtransaction at every step here
[3332.26 → 3337.50] and there and I'm not saying that many of the developers at valve probably close to all of them I'm
[3337.50 → 3342.02] not saying they don't do it out of joy and out of passion they definitely do anyone in that kind of
[3342.02 → 3346.58] industry has got to have some passion for it, I'm just saying it's a business the things they do are
[3346.58 → 3356.86] calculated business decisions not random yeah um all right there are really cool things that
[3356.86 → 3364.22] all right blah blah blah okay uh this was posted by Thomas d and the original article here is from
[3364.22 → 3374.68] torrent freak and the FCC internet policy thing is actually looking not as fantastic as uh as some
[3374.68 → 3381.60] people might have hoped i think we called it so uh you called it specifically i don't think i did
[3381.60 → 3388.54] so they included a copyright loophole that many protested against uh nothing in in this part
[3388.54 → 3393.98] prohibits some reasonable effort by a provider of broadband internet access service to address copyright
[3393.98 → 3398.56] infringement or other unlawful activity the FCC argues that copyright infringement hurts the economy
[3398.56 → 3403.40] so ISPS are free to take appropriate measures against this traffic activists have stated that carving
[3403.40 → 3407.84] a copyright loophole in net neutrality would leave your lawful activities at the mercy of overbroad
[3407.84 → 3412.02] copyright filtering schemes, and we already have plenty of experience with copyright enforcers
[3412.02 → 3418.06] targeting legitimate users by mistake carelessness or design so remember guys this is an article
[3418.06 → 3425.98] on torrentfreak.com we know exactly what their focus is its right in the name yeah, but that doesn't
[3425.98 → 3432.12] mean that the whole net neutrality thing is as cut and dried as yeah neutral internet there's a huge
[3432.12 → 3436.60] you get that speed everywhere all the time no matter what yeah it was never going to be that potential
[3436.60 → 3443.92] loophole now and like the a big problem with copyright law is that it's so abusable on both sides
[3443.92 → 3452.12] not even just one so they could be like oh well you like screenshotted a page therefore made a copy of
[3452.12 → 3459.20] a photo once five years ago therefore you get 10 speed all-time screen you all did my put my hair up
[3459.20 → 3465.88] there you go i get why my wife does that now that makes a big difference she's always like yeah I'm warm
[3465.88 → 3473.56] I'm putting my hair up I'm like how could that possibly help it helps i got insight, and it's an insulator how did
[3473.56 → 3477.06] you not figure that out well no i know but i didn't I didn't think just the back of your neck
[3477.06 → 3481.54] made that big of a difference i don't whatever screw you man um all right so our next topic today
[3481.54 → 3489.64] posted by four Andrew with a four and a capital n for whatever reason tesla is now allowed to sell
[3489.64 → 3495.24] directly in New Jersey this shouldn't be news this should never have been anything they should have
[3495.24 → 3501.00] been able to sell their cars or whoever they want regardless and do it directly without dealerships
[3501.00 → 3507.64] but you look better with your hair up thank you but the uh the governor made it uh made it banned
[3507.64 → 3513.36] and then now it has been reversed one year after they were originally told they were not allowed to
[3513.36 → 3517.54] do it there are some stipulations i think they have to have what four retail stores and a service centre
[3517.54 → 3523.68] no they're only allowed to open four retail stores, and they must open one service centre they should be
[3523.68 → 3528.50] allowed to have as many stores as they want yeah that's so stupid i love the quote from Elon Musk
[3528.50 → 3535.34] comes after Elon Musk compared local dealers to a mafia protection racket subverting the democratic
[3535.34 → 3542.76] process bam you got told son it's kind of true yep it's like the whole taxi driver thing here in
[3542.76 → 3550.86] Vancouver yeah we're like Uber cannot be here because by law only taxis may drive you places yeah you have
[3550.86 → 3557.00] got to be kidding me a better service comes along, and you are it's not allowed to compete with the
[3557.00 → 3563.00] crappy service like can you imagine if when the refrigerator was invented like no ice boxes
[3563.00 → 3569.12] are the only thing allowed being sold in Vancouver yeah or like restaurants may not use refrigerators
[3569.12 → 3574.88] they must use ice boxes because what would happen what would happen to the ice harvesters if not for
[3574.88 → 3582.52] the i don't know maybe they could go be refrigerator sales people like the world changes with taxi drivers
[3582.52 → 3589.08] could become Uber drivers whoa i now and then they might actually have to be polite to their
[3589.08 → 3596.22] customers whoa and like if they screw you over and go the wrong route because you're tired and just
[3596.22 → 3602.74] got off a plane you could dispute the fare and get your money back whoa which Brandon and i have done
[3602.74 → 3607.30] quite a few times on trips really compare the trip we'll get back to the hotel and be like that seemed
[3607.30 → 3612.50] like a roundabout like it seemed like they went the long way right, and then we just Google Maps check
[3612.50 → 3617.30] out the Uber map of the drive that we just did be like hmm dispute get money back it's happened like
[3617.30 → 3621.98] quite a few times just like that man, and you'll because you'll be able to see like this was the
[3621.98 → 3629.28] route he did this okay like with Google Maps it'll give you traffic information so sometimes
[3629.28 → 3633.00] I'll even check in the car instead of correcting I'll be like whatever I'll just work on my phone then
[3633.00 → 3643.94] we get there and dispute like whatever get wrecked son yeah all right so Nintendo's next console no which
[3643.94 → 3651.54] basically only exists as a slide in a presentation about that they're working on something uh this was
[3651.54 → 3655.88] posted by top war gamer on the forum and the original article here is from Kodak and I'm just
[3655.88 → 3659.70] going to wait for the article to come up so that you guys can have like the punchline
[3659.70 → 3668.70] now available for pre-order what i love the picture that they used like EB games Australia
[3668.70 → 3675.76] Nintendo have confirmed and by the way it has confirmed EB games Nintendo have confirmed they're
[3675.76 → 3679.44] developing a dedicated gaming platform normally i wouldn't be a stickler about something like that i
[3679.44 → 3684.04] wouldn't be like haha you are a bad person because you used wrong words like the but like when you're
[3684.04 → 3689.52] being an idiot in general already and okay and when it's like the press output of an I'm going to like
[3689.52 → 3699.96] I'm gonna pile on with the code name no they've said more info will come next year it's march like next
[3699.96 → 3708.48] year isn't like and that's more info next year isn't six weeks from now like the no is now available
[3708.48 → 3717.90] for pre-order in store we literally know absolutely nothing about it, i mean aside from wanting to be
[3717.90 → 3723.66] the person with bragging rights because you were the first person who pre-ordered a Nintendo no or
[3723.66 → 3728.48] whatever they end up calling it maybe they'll call it the poo this time because we left too much to
[3728.48 → 3737.00] the imagination um i this is ridiculous I'm done absolutely ridiculous like they're trying to redo the
[3737.00 → 3742.78] duke nuke thing where people had like pre-order slips from 10 years ago like people are gonna
[3742.78 → 3746.08] have pre-order strips from literally possibly two years because they're like we will give you more
[3746.08 → 3751.14] information next year not it's releasing next year this will give you more information they'll be like
[3751.14 → 3758.06] oh it's a like they announced the Wii a while before it came out they announced things before they
[3758.06 → 3764.74] come out the Nintendo direct is awesome i love Nintendo direct all right let's go ahead and uh oh
[3764.74 → 3769.06] all right showed the document instead of the actual page that I'm supposed to show uh this was
[3769.06 → 3774.94] posted by Victoria's secret, and you know how max just work, and they're super secure apparently safari's
[3774.94 → 3783.68] private browsing mode saves URLs in an ex in an easily accessible file so uh this shot is great
[3783.68 → 3789.12] i love that i wonder if he created this screenshot at work he's like no, no really i have to go on
[3789.12 → 3794.18] porn hub so that i can like to make a screenshot of how i went on porn hub really i promise that's why I'm on
[3794.18 → 3802.76] porn hub he did only go to the home page oh i guess that's true yep look at that database structure
[3802.76 → 3808.66] page URL boom so if you're using safari on your Mac for your private browsing needs you might want to
[3808.66 → 3817.18] not do that like at all that's so awkward yeah now everyone in the audience that has like
[3817.18 → 3822.96] a brother or sister that owns a mac is going to run and go look at their private browsing history
[3822.96 → 3831.70] wreck them hey mom and dad look oh don't tell them we told you we don't want to get like angry calls
[3831.70 → 3840.24] from like people's parents being like or like tweets like my son told me that i blah blah blah i was
[3840.24 → 3844.54] shopping for one of these that's my personal thing i keep in my nightstand
[3844.54 → 3852.68] i didn't think my husband did that oh yeah you ruined our marriage
[3852.68 → 3859.34] wow i don't want to be responsible for that all right so NVIDIA this was posted by among on the
[3859.34 → 3868.00] forum so kitguru.net um says that NVIDIA's pascal architectures NV link could enable eight
[3868.00 → 3878.30] way multi GPU capabilities holy balls because scaling on four-way wasn't bad enough well it also
[3878.30 → 3883.36] promises some other improvements including better communication between the cards and SLI which is
[3883.36 → 3891.42] one of the big reasons that SLI doesn't scale as well as it could because you need a ton of bandwidth
[3891.42 → 3895.90] in order like the more cards you add the more they all have to talk with each other think with
[3895.90 → 3902.94] the ram sharing thing yeah they have to actually share that that's a lot of talking yep, yep so uh so
[3902.94 → 3909.72] blah blah blah blah even the Intel Core i75960x only has 40 PCIE 3.0 lanes therefore uh can connect up
[3909.72 → 3916.72] to four cards using PCIE 3.08x NVIDIA will implement support of their proprietary NV link bus into its next
[3916.72 → 3923.30] generation pascal GPUs each NV link point to point connection will support 20 gigabytes per second of
[3923.30 → 3930.72] bandwidth in both directions simultaneously and each pascal high-end GPU will support at least four such
[3930.72 → 3939.46] links so PCI Express bandwidth would be preserved for CPU to GPU communications and that's if it's projected
[3939.46 → 3946.70] to deliver up to two times higher performance in many applications compared to PCIE among pure GPU
[3946.70 → 3955.02] so IBM apparently plans to add NV link to select power processors for supercomputers as well so just
[3955.02 → 3962.00] to be clear that 20 gigabytes per second of bandwidth between cards is about half of what a card has total
[3962.00 → 3967.60] right now to communicate with like you know if it had to overflow to system memory or communicate with
[3967.60 → 3974.30] the CPU or with another GPU or like two other GPUs balling that's crazy yeah this is just
[3974.30 → 3980.76] generally crazy um i really want to be we got to make sure that they give us eight cards yeah i want
[3980.76 → 3987.46] multi GPU scaling to not suck that would be super cool yeah i think that's pretty much all i had for
[3987.46 → 3993.94] the show today i could do a live unboxing of the new razor blade i can talk more about this i had other
[3993.94 → 3999.02] complaints why don't I go get the razor blade while you talk about that, but that's like all the topics i
[3999.02 → 4003.82] have for this week yeah why don't we do a twitter blitz yeah we haven't done a twitter blitz in
[4003.82 → 4009.38] forever okay well it's open season guys hit us at Linus tech on Twitter and I'll negatives of me
[4009.38 → 4013.70] switching to an iPhone we'll take your uh we'll take your we'll take your tweets when i get back with
[4013.70 → 4018.72] oh wait is there no it's not a question yeah just open-ended wow it's been a while i know we haven't
[4018.72 → 4023.14] done that in forever we've always got so many topics to cover we do all right I'm getting up
[4023.14 → 4026.68] here finally a week when it wasn't super important i have to log in with my finger
[4026.68 → 4035.16] wait what oh, oh it's an or yeah i want to do you can set up multiple fingers too try again
[4035.16 → 4041.20] try again wow you suck at life try again
[4041.20 → 4048.70] I'm going to assume its try again come on
[4048.70 → 4056.14] your passcode is required to enable touch ID really
[4056.14 → 4066.42] okay so my other complaints if uh i needed this for a piece of backend software for something
[4066.42 → 4070.86] that I'm using or not piece of backend software for an app that monitors a piece of backend software
[4070.86 → 4076.16] that I'm using for a project that I'm not going to talk about right now it doesn't work on android
[4076.16 → 4083.54] they only have an iPhone app so i had to switch from my Moto X to an iPhone 5s i think this is yeah
[4083.54 → 4089.60] hey the background moves a little bit when i move around that's kind of distracting uh anyway
[4089.60 → 4095.14] so the first thing that i do when i get the phone is like okay i want to use this freaking app to see
[4095.14 → 4099.86] if it like works properly because i switched to this freaking phone for this freaking app so the
[4099.86 → 4104.94] freaking app better work properly so i go to download it and i go into the store and I'm like
[4104.94 → 4112.00] okay this is fairly straightforward search type the thing in uh install next whatever
[4112.00 → 4118.68] and then it sits there for like a super long time doing absolutely nothing and I'm like what the hell
[4118.68 → 4124.06] and then like five minutes later it's like i need a password for this and i need you to type it in
[4124.06 → 4128.18] like three times and enable this thing and click next here and all this kind of stuff I'm like I'm
[4128.18 → 4136.02] trying to install a free app why do you need all this crap like why is this so ridiculous and then
[4136.02 → 4141.54] it sent me like six emails because it's like wow you logged in on this device, and you activated this
[4141.54 → 4147.26] thing, and you downloaded this free app which you apparently need an invoice email for and like all this
[4147.26 → 4153.50] other crap how else would you know you didn't pay anything for if it's so annoying bam stop messing
[4153.50 → 4160.18] with me, I'll never stop messing with you, it's annoying me and then like okay, okay i went to go
[4160.18 → 4164.80] install Twitter and Instagram and i noticed on both of them there was a little tag that said essentials
[4164.80 → 4171.00] and i was like oh that's cool maybe there's like a super incredibly common app area called essentials
[4171.00 → 4176.58] and i can't find it oh yeah the app store searches is not very good it's terrible i searched for
[4176.58 → 4183.04] essentials i searched into uh what is popular categories popular collections i was like oh
[4183.04 → 4189.22] that's obviously going to have essentials oh, but it has made in Canada just in case anyone gave any
[4189.22 → 4196.18] craps that a kind of that an app was made in Canada ridiculous we're Canadian we're sort of over us not
[4196.18 → 4202.70] being important that's fine that is fine all right so here we go um it's not even there browse by category
[4202.70 → 4207.26] books business catalogues education entertainment finance food and drink blah blah velocity asks
[4207.26 → 4213.08] will the titan x deliver better gaming performance than a 980 kingpin yes of course yes a 980 is a 980
[4213.08 → 4218.18] and it can be a fast 980, but it's still a 980 although i do want to kind of do the price per performance
[4218.18 → 4223.66] comparison thing between a kingpin and titan x yeah that's not a bad idea versus 999 do you know of a
[4223.66 → 4229.10] third-party Wi-Fi booster case to operate quadcopters for longer distances haven't used anything like that
[4229.10 → 4234.72] personally although i have heard that they um like I've heard about them, i don't know if they
[4234.72 → 4240.24] specifically exist yet but in what format will videos about the new office be um they'll probably
[4240.24 → 4247.76] be kind of vlog style yeah um with bits and things that happen um does the razor Naga mouse have too
[4247.76 → 4252.50] many side buttons to be usable for games like Skyrim Mycroft and other games with hot bars what kind
[4252.50 → 4256.82] of a question is that i don't actually get it you count how many buttons it has, and then you figure
[4256.82 → 4261.08] out how many things you want to bind to buttons and then that's a very personalized i think you're
[4261.08 → 4265.48] attacking him a little bit too much i think that was mean well no but like you need to take a step
[4265.48 → 4270.92] back what kind of question is that buddy bro does it have too many settle down buddy you have too
[4270.92 → 4275.92] many whoa because like the mobile one has less, and they're larger and more clickable so maybe
[4275.92 → 4279.58] he's like well your finger will get lost, and you don't need that, but you can't ask if it has too many
[4279.58 → 4286.08] yeah oh come on now um are you guys planning on reviewing the Mrs 7 for master up i actually wasn't
[4286.08 → 4292.22] planning to I've only listened to it very briefly and uh headphone reviews don't always do
[4292.22 → 4296.34] the best for us so like we have a bazillion other things on the go right now so that was
[4296.34 → 4302.72] that was on the like bottom of the priority list yeah um i don't know wait what do we tweet to you
[4302.72 → 4310.76] about not that no specifically that just got a r9 290 first desktop GPU after a laptop for four
[4310.76 → 4315.84] years yeah that would be amazing holy crap um what's my take on Paul and kyle's new show
[4315.84 → 4321.60] what's the difference between that and this show except clown suits except it being worse they have
[4321.60 → 4327.36] no clown suits and ours being clearly better yeah because clown suits because I'm kyle, and you're Paul
[4327.36 → 4334.50] yeah you saw that yeah we had a show that was exactly their show we're we smile Paul Luke and Linus
[4334.50 → 4340.94] this, so this show has four hosts we simulated the experience yeah um were you surprised by the
[4340.94 → 4346.26] titan x price uh yeah actually i was expecting it to be higher i thought it was maybe uh 1300 yeah i
[4346.26 → 4350.52] thought they were going to go 12.99 with it and i thought it would be done it double precision so yes
[4350.52 → 4355.56] maybe that's what happened yeah i think that's exactly what happened what do you think about the
[4355.56 → 4361.56] flash boost ah this is a badminton racket question um i was like no i didn't break it yet i have
[4361.56 → 4365.38] actually I've whacked it on the floor once and I've had a couple of clashes with people i was playing
[4365.38 → 4373.08] with someone who's like super inexperienced and um, and she actually whacked her racket against mine
[4373.08 → 4381.50] pretty bad and uh yeah that's who and um no it didn't break the flash boost is renowned for being
[4381.50 → 4385.52] made of glass and breaking extremely quickly i was quite worried that it was going to break i did get
[4385.52 → 4393.08] the 5u version which is the slightly not as light and fragile version, so maybe that saved it not 100%
[4393.08 → 4399.98] sure do you think there'll be a 980 ti oh i don't know no wait what no, no wait no that would
[4399.98 → 4406.70] completely break their naming scheme because the 980 is already a fully enabled gm204, so a ti would
[4406.70 → 4412.38] only be a clock speed bump and i really don't think it has that much left in it um whereas like a 780
[4412.38 → 4421.56] versus uh so so like a 980 ti to be significantly faster than a 980 would have to be gm200 which would
[4421.56 → 4426.60] be the same GPU as titan x which, but then they've screwed with that before haven't they maybe they
[4426.60 → 4433.64] just really cripple gm200 once yields are better and costs are lower yeah is 7500 live viewers a new
[4433.64 → 4440.54] record that's a lot holy crap that is a lot Richard says you're going to grow to love the iPhone
[4440.54 → 4447.14] i any chance of doing super fight on channel super fun is this like i have that or something
[4447.14 → 4452.04] oh i have that is it that's a card game oh you get uh I've never played it but i have it
[4452.04 → 4458.34] oh no we have a bunch that came in the super fun the super the loot crate oh okay cool yeah
[4458.34 → 4462.10] yeah let's do if it's like a you get different attributes, and you essentially get like a fighter
[4462.10 → 4466.16] and then you have to debate over why your fighter would beat the other person's fighter oh wow that
[4466.16 → 4473.02] sounds like the most annoying game ever to play with everyone here you me Burke and Terran yeah
[4473.02 → 4477.98] us four would be the most annoying people to fight against Terran will be the single most
[4477.98 → 4484.42] obnoxious person in the world to play that game with um any more info on the plans for the layout of
[4484.42 → 4489.78] the new office nothing yet, but it's actually one of our community members who designed the layout of
[4489.78 → 4494.08] the inside i don't know if even you know that no i know that yeah, and so we're gonna perfect
[4494.08 → 4500.38] job rapid development too we're going to have him as a guest on the land show once it's done and uh
[4500.38 → 4505.08] we'll have him sort of talk through a lot of the uh a lot of the process uh a lot of the processes
[4505.08 → 4509.62] that went into it, I've had some like feedback for him, and he'll instantly hit me back with the new
[4509.62 → 4514.50] rendered update like within minutes which is insane I'll send him a question and I'll get an email
[4514.50 → 4519.84] back before i can like to go to another tab and come back yep he's uh he's been incredible he's good um so
[4519.84 → 4525.24] peter asks is acer sending you a free sync version of the 144 hertz IPS monitor as well
[4525.24 → 4530.50] uh not that I'm aware of I'm not aware that that monitor exists you got to understand free sync versus
[4530.50 → 4535.76] g-sync isn't like a toggle switch that they hit inside the monitor it is a completely different
[4535.76 → 4542.40] monitor like it could have the same panel maybe, but it would be a completely different interface
[4542.40 → 4549.02] behind it um so no it doesn't work that way like monitors will just be what they are and there won't
[4549.02 → 4555.42] you won't be like free sync g-sync version like you know space gray, and you know titanium
[4555.42 → 4562.10] black or whatever they call it this looks like real dyed hair now yep you look horrible yeah
[4562.10 → 4569.32] oh that's why you put it back on yeah yeah yeah because good old Linus four cells like where'd your
[4569.32 → 4576.72] hat go you just got it's back it's back just for you Linus man just for you man um it's so
[4576.72 → 4582.02] uncomfortable, but it's back does anyone in the office actually use Crunchyroll i think so i have
[4582.02 → 4589.46] okay well there you go yeah i won't claim that i do um not much of an anime guy myself me neither
[4589.46 → 4596.20] I've just I've used it i understand the service yep, so there's that yep i wanted to use it because uh
[4596.20 → 4601.64] honestly i didn't know it existed until they started sponsoring us really and yeah because i had watched
[4601.64 → 4605.98] like I'm not that big into anime but I'll watch some of it sometimes just to kind of understand what
[4606.72 → 4610.34] is freaking talking about right because one group of my friends is super into it like super hardcore
[4610.34 → 4613.98] yeah, yeah so I'll watch some of it sometimes i don't have any friends so it's not a problem for
[4613.98 → 4618.60] me i was like oh this service could make it way easier because i don't know they get this stuff
[4618.60 → 4623.90] from wherever well i don't know there's like a bazillion anime yeah and I'll try to find it I'm
[4623.90 → 4629.14] like i don't uh yeah and there'll be like these free sites then you're like this is sketchy but
[4629.14 → 4633.98] maybe it's legit actually, and then it might not have the right subtitles and then i can't find the
[4633.98 → 4640.20] right episode and I'm like uh so yeah it simplified things okay this is a good one what is your
[4640.20 → 4645.82] favourite flavour of pie slash cake strawberry rhubarb pie strawberry rhubarb pie really that's your
[4645.82 → 4654.12] favourite yeah oh what's yours um wow okay it's kind of tough because like a perfect blueberry pie
[4654.12 → 4660.56] with vanilla ice cream like is pretty much to die for if I've had blueberry pie it was like
[4660.56 → 4665.96] 10 years ago oh blueberry pie is amazing and I've never had like an i don't think before my
[4665.96 → 4670.32] aunt like stabs me in the throat i don't think I've ever had like a homemade blueberry pie oh
[4670.32 → 4676.06] blueberry pie is amazing and like you blueberry pie can be uh like you can get the like the super
[4676.06 → 4680.04] sweet blueberry pie where it's kind of like a like a sugar gel yeah holding the blueberries
[4680.04 → 4684.44] together and that can be perfect if you're in the mood for that but then I'd probably be more
[4684.44 → 4691.04] into the more natural blueberry pie where it's just uh like a sugared crust and then blueberries
[4691.04 → 4695.76] like just basically like the guts are just jam packed with blueberries that sounds awesome with
[4695.76 → 4700.46] vanilla ice cream is like French vanilla ice cream to die for I'm not into the French vanilla personally
[4700.46 → 4707.38] but it would work with that too yeah um and then for cake i actually really like the TNT fruit cake
[4707.38 → 4714.40] like TNT is a local like uh Asian supermarket I've never had that yeah my wife has learned to
[4714.40 → 4721.04] clone it just like the Chinese do nice and um nice so she can make it herself although we usually buy
[4721.04 → 4725.80] it anyway because it's an awful lot of work for her to make it for a cake i like just like ice cream
[4725.80 → 4732.16] cakes or like a strawberry cheesecake you know i had so much ice cream cake as a kid i can't even look
[4732.16 → 4736.70] at them now really it's funny because i like ice cream and I'll eat certain kinds of cake but
[4736.70 → 4741.62] something about whether it's the like the chocolate crunchy crumble and this and that and
[4741.62 → 4746.90] that the big problem with ice cream cake is that the vast majority of them use that crappy whipped
[4746.90 → 4753.54] topping yeah yeah whipped topping kills anything it just it's what is fondant instantly just oh fondant
[4753.54 → 4759.38] is evil horrible yeah i had never tried fondant until bless your hearts um some members of our
[4759.38 → 4766.30] community sent me that knock to a fan cake i think looked amazing it looked so cool yeah i took one bite of
[4766.30 → 4775.00] it and then i was like wow whatever this stuff on top of it is not very good at all the inside
[4775.00 → 4781.56] was actually good i ended up like hollowing out a few pieces no joke because i was like i don't have
[4781.56 → 4787.40] any food right now actually so i hollowed out some cake pieces yeah that's uh even without food it was
[4787.40 → 4794.10] not worth eating the fondant that was horrendous um yes we are definitely going to do an office tour
[4794.10 → 4802.38] um I'm personally impartial Luke is definitely a fan droid um i haven't used iOS I've never had an iPhone
[4802.38 → 4810.54] so we'll find out holy crap now that we've started doing twitter blocks 277 people hit us
[4810.54 → 4815.54] um do you see free sync staying as it is or getting better oh it'll definitely get better
[4815.54 → 4820.24] it will absolutely get better free sync the technology supports something like nine hertz
[4820.24 → 4825.64] up to 250 hertz or something stupid like that, so there's lots of room for it to continue to improve
[4825.64 → 4833.00] it's just the panels need to catch up um have you ever cross-threaded motherboard standoffs yep
[4833.00 → 4839.56] how do you deal with it, you take the whole board back out you put pliers on either side you wrench
[4839.56 → 4843.86] them back apart, and you find a new standoff because you just wrecked it yep when is the next scrapyard
[4843.86 → 4849.64] wars we are very likely to do a scrapyard wars um as soon as we can once i get back from Japan
[4849.64 → 4853.76] once we both get back from Japan yeah, and it should actually be like awesome we already planned a lot of
[4853.76 → 4860.78] it out yep going to be good stuff uh you probably won't read this but can you read my name i read your name
[4860.78 → 4866.50] but I'm not going to read it out loud because you like spammed us the took and the yeah you tried
[4866.50 → 4871.74] um what else we got i don't know how to say what would you attempt if you knew you couldn't fail
[4871.74 → 4881.28] jumping out of the space station and landing on earth what would I attempt if i knew jumping yeah
[4881.28 → 4888.44] jumping out of the Isis and landing on earth no colonizing Mars in into in entirety yourself so
[4888.44 → 4894.94] basically how much sex would you be having tons i would colonize my you know i don't have a better
[4894.94 → 4902.92] answer than that so I'm going to let you win you just won the entire show um guys thank you so oh, oh i said
[4902.92 → 4909.76] i would unbox right this is the new blade 14. Yes please I won't be needing that one any more oh
[4909.76 → 4915.48] so this is the laptop I'll be taking with me as a portable workstation for my trip to
[4915.48 → 4921.94] Asia I'll be getting on a plane in about eight hours so I am out of here I have a lot of people
[4921.94 → 4927.26] wondering what the heck I'm doing still here in Canada because we released a video where in the
[4927.26 → 4930.82] beginning I'm like well assuming all goes according to plan I'll be in Asia right now
[4930.82 → 4936.02] yeah oh okay that's what happened that got pushed up on the schedule so many people have been like
[4936.02 → 4940.44] well because you tweeted something about something I don't remember what they're like you just tweeted
[4940.44 → 4943.76] this and I'm like no I didn't they're like don't you have control of Linus's Twitter account while
[4943.76 → 4951.66] he's on vacation I'm like first no second of all he's not what okay that makes way more sense
[4951.66 → 4958.08] yeah so that's how that went down all right so it comes packaged the same way as the other blade 14
[4958.08 → 4963.06] and the same way as like an NVIDIA reference graphics card it's got a green stripe
[4963.06 → 4970.84] now with 30 more stripes oh it is basically just a generational upgrade now with 30 more gen
[4970.84 → 4974.96] the razor blade 14 there's a laptop inside
[4974.96 → 4983.66] yay there is a laptop power adapter inside also a wire for it what else we got in here
[4983.66 → 4985.56] some manuals
[4985.56 → 4986.56] some manuals
[4986.56 → 4990.56] yay manuals
[4990.56 → 4991.20] woo
[4991.20 → 4991.80] woo
[4991.80 → 4992.76] woo
[4992.76 → 4996.88] all right then there's the laptop it comes in this plastic
[4996.88 → 4998.28] oh I broke the plastic
[4998.28 → 5002.06] I hope there's a technical writer that writes manuals and I hope his name is a manual
[5002.06 → 5009.24] I really hope that's a thing somewhere
[5009.24 → 5013.74] so the blade 14 still looks just like the old blade 14
[5013.74 → 5015.18] it's uh
[5015.18 → 5018.60] I like the green USB ports
[5018.60 → 5025.16] there are a couple of things that are still like i I still I love this ID top facing speakers
[5025.16 → 5029.40] it's got three usb3 ports which is more than a lot of super slim laptops have
[5029.40 → 5035.72] uh the fact that the uh the 870m or whatever was in the last one didn't throttle was super nice
[5035.72 → 5039.56] I don't know if that will continue to be true about the 970m I haven't tried this one yet
[5039.56 → 5044.56] but the 970m throttled like wicked hard in the uh in that gigabyte one that we just reviewed
[5044.56 → 5046.22] that's coming out soon by the way
[5046.22 → 5049.72] uh but I'm extremely excited to try it there are still a couple of things that aren't perfect
[5049.72 → 5051.10] it needs a SD card reader
[5051.10 → 5052.82] and why
[5052.82 → 5054.04] HTML
[5054.04 → 5056.18] instead of mini DisplayPort
[5056.18 → 5060.66] like I literally can't think of a single compelling reason on the face of the earth
[5060.66 → 5060.98] okay
[5060.98 → 5062.44] okay what would it be
[5062.44 → 5063.10] it's more common
[5063.10 → 5067.64] if you're walking into a presentation place they'll have pre-run cables they'll never
[5067.64 → 5068.40] have DisplayPort
[5068.40 → 5070.78] yeah but I could carry a mini DisplayPort to HDMI
[5070.78 → 5071.82] who's going to do that other than you
[5071.82 → 5076.62] and you can passively cheaply adapt mini DisplayPort to anything
[5076.62 → 5077.44] but who's going to do that
[5077.44 → 5078.02] HDMI can't
[5078.02 → 5081.16] okay, okay well let's let's talk about your boardroom
[5081.16 → 5082.94] it's probably got a VGA projector
[5082.94 → 5085.72] you're going to adapt your you're going to adapt your HDMI to VGA
[5085.72 → 5086.70] yeah didn't think so
[5086.70 → 5087.86] I'm a web 2.0 company
[5087.86 → 5089.80] that doesn't like DisplayPort
[5089.80 → 5091.00] I'm a web 2.0 company
[5091.00 → 5093.16] yeah because everyone who owns a blade
[5093.16 → 5095.96] is going to only do presentations
[5095.96 → 5097.30] at web 2.0 company
[5097.30 → 5098.54] that is how the world works
[5098.54 → 5100.18] speaking of how the world works
[5100.18 → 5103.28] someone who owns a blade probably isn't going to do a presentation at a company that's a VGA projector
[5103.28 → 5105.42] all good things that come to an end
[5105.42 → 5106.88] wait all good things
[5106.88 → 5108.12] all good things must come to an end
[5108.12 → 5108.56] thank you
[5108.56 → 5110.18] thanks for watching guys
[5110.18 → 5112.34] I will see you on the other side
[5112.34 → 5112.74] like VGA projector
[5112.74 → 5113.70] when I'm back
[5113.70 → 5114.72] from
[5114.72 → 5115.42] oh
