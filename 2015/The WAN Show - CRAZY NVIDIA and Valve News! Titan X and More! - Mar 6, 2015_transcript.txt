[0.00 --> 8.74]  Showtime again. Welcome to the show where we talk tech and usually there are two of us, but today as you can see, I am on my own.
[8.96 --> 23.44]  Luke's not even here to enjoy the brand new, now not only including his Twitter handle Lower Third, but also alignment on the logo fix Lower Third.
[23.44 --> 34.24]  I'll just have to appreciate that all by myself. So it's been quite the eventful week, both here at Linus Media Group and outside of Linus Media Group.
[34.64 --> 49.70]  We're making some pretty significant progress on our upcoming headquarters. We had a lot of people tell us that, hey, yeah, the sound on that chair racing channel super fun video was not super fantastic.
[49.70 --> 66.98]  And oh, shoot, I just realized my title is wrong. This should be the WAN show. Weekly tech and gaming talk Fridays at 1630. Boom, that is updated.
[66.98 --> 75.92]  So a lot of people said the sound was not very exceptional, but we have actually made significant progress on that since then.
[76.56 --> 93.16]  And it's been expensive, but yeah, it's been expensive, but we're still, you know, we're trucking on and we're really, really excited about what there is to do.
[93.16 --> 102.04]  A bunch of people are apparently complaining about the Lower Third. Too bad! We are sticking with the Lower Third exactly the way it is. You want to know why? Because I like it.
[102.34 --> 111.84]  And it's Linus Media Group, where if I want it changed, I have to pay someone to do it, and that's expensive. So that is exactly why we are leaving that.
[111.84 --> 121.02]  I've got a, oh great, we've got our topics for the day. So tons of stuff. It was hard to pick out what is coolest this week.
[121.02 --> 130.20]  But I think Valve Steam Machines finally coming. Also what appears to be the mostly, we hope, final version of the Steam Controller.
[130.20 --> 138.00]  Details being out there is pretty darn exciting. Oh, actually I didn't talk about this when I did my show announcement a minute ago to upload to YouTube.
[138.00 --> 144.72]  But Valve also has that VR headset that they've collaborated with HTC on. That looks really exciting.
[144.72 --> 148.72]  They've got a new technology called Lighthouse that we'll talk a little bit more about later.
[148.72 --> 155.90]  Also this week at GDC, Nvidia launched the Shield again. This time it's a completely different device.
[155.90 --> 160.98]  And that old one has been renamed and you'd think they could just come up with another word anyway.
[160.98 --> 164.34]  We'll talk about the Shield TV console thing.
[164.34 --> 170.64]  The Titan X, Nvidia's new flagship graphics card. Details are kind of all over the place now.
[170.64 --> 176.82]  And, oh, apparently Luke is ready to call in. So maybe what I'll do is I'll tease one more topic.
[176.82 --> 184.88]  That's AMD's FreeSync is being officially launched. Very exciting to people like me who super duper believe in this whole variable refresh rate thing.
[184.88 --> 191.92]  And then I'll go ahead, I'll roll the intro and I'll get Luke kind of coming on the show here. Welcome to the WAD Show.
[200.64 --> 220.82]  This is interesting.
[220.82 --> 231.00]  Okay, I think I have my call in settings right. But I'm gonna hopefully... No, he's not muted.
[231.00 --> 233.00]  Hey, are you there?
[233.00 --> 234.00]  Hello.
[234.00 --> 237.00]  I don't have a video feed for you.
[237.00 --> 240.00]  Ummm...
[240.00 --> 242.00]  Whoa!
[242.00 --> 247.18]  Alright, well let me do the... Hold on, let me do the sponsors for a minute. I see you now, I see you now. Hold on, let me do the sponsors. Okay.
[247.18 --> 251.18]  So our sponsors today are Linda.com!
[251.18 --> 255.18]  Let's try to be completely appropriate about Linda.com this week, okay, for the first time ever.
[255.18 --> 258.18]  Also, LootGrate! Save 10% with offer code Linus.
[258.18 --> 262.18]  And finally, PAX East, powered by HyperX.
[262.18 --> 271.02]  Wouldn't have happened without HyperX. Wouldn't have happened without this freaking guy that I'm gonna go ahead and find a way to... No, they can't see you yet.
[271.02 --> 279.20]  That's a great dance. And I'm appreciating it. Hold on, I gotta turn you down as well. You're probably blowing everyone's ears out because of...
[279.20 --> 280.20]  Awesome.
[280.20 --> 283.20]  ...for whatever reason, it's by default very big.
[283.20 --> 294.20]  Alright, add screen region. And... This is so weird! Because you are, like, you are not... You are not a show guest. You are... You actually... No.
[294.20 --> 303.38]  You live on this show. And so, having you call in as a guest is actually, like, tripping me out pretty hardcore right now.
[303.38 --> 306.38]  Alright, let me just... I feel like I should introduce myself.
[306.38 --> 314.56]  No, it's bizarre. So, today we've got, uh, Luke Lafreniere. He's from a publication called Lines Tech Tips. You may or may not have it.
[314.56 --> 318.56]  I don't know why he hangs out with those guys. He should really find some, like, cooler kids to hang out with.
[318.56 --> 322.56]  Hold on, I'm trying to... I'm trying to get you all, like, aligned nicely with the bottom thing here. So you get...
[322.56 --> 327.56]  You're usually... Actually, you got a little more than half the screen, but I think it kind of works because I'm smaller than you.
[327.56 --> 335.18]  Alright, so you missed the, uh, you missed the, the intro Malaysian part, but that's okay. We have a new lower third. I don't know if you noticed that.
[336.14 --> 344.48]  I, I, I'm still, like, I told you I'm ready, but I'm super not. So, like, I'm still opening everything. I haven't even seen the actual Twitch stream yet.
[344.94 --> 348.10]  Um, but I, I heard that we had a new lower third. I just haven't seen it.
[348.24 --> 353.08]  Apparently you're still too loud. I'm gonna turn you down some more. Is that, is that better, guys? Try again.
[354.10 --> 355.74]  Hello, testing one, two, three, four.
[355.74 --> 358.06]  Oh, for crying out loud. Okay, how's that? Try again.
[359.08 --> 363.22]  I'm talking about things that happened at PAX, although I'm not sure if that's what I'm talking about.
[363.34 --> 363.88]  That's a lot better.
[363.90 --> 364.96]  Because apparently tons of other things happened.
[365.26 --> 370.24]  Yep, should be good. Alright, so, uh, I've got someone complaining about the one pixel line.
[370.34 --> 372.98]  I have you misaligned by one pixel at the top, and I'm gonna leave it.
[373.32 --> 374.28]  Because that's how I roll.
[374.96 --> 379.80]  Um, okay, so, why don't we, uh, do you want to just give me sort of a rough, what's the vibe?
[379.90 --> 381.58]  What's the vibe at PAX? How's it going?
[381.58 --> 386.96]  Um, a lot of the vibe is that everyone actually kind of wanted to be at GDC.
[388.02 --> 388.50]  Oh.
[388.78 --> 395.04]  Um, yeah, so, back when I was like, hey, we should maybe check this out, and then decided
[395.04 --> 399.70]  that it wasn't that important, that was apparently the wrong, the wrong, uh, idea.
[399.80 --> 401.34]  Because, like, everything happened at GDC.
[401.62 --> 404.00]  GDC was bananas this year.
[404.28 --> 406.18]  Yes, and usually it's not really.
[406.18 --> 410.44]  Usually it's super developer heavy and all that kind of stuff, but, like, tons of hardware
[410.44 --> 412.08]  stuff went down at GDC.
[412.08 --> 412.70]  Go figure.
[413.14 --> 414.76]  Like, that, that's crazy to me.
[414.82 --> 418.42]  I mean, what, what, um, when has a graphics card ever launched at GDC?
[418.42 --> 418.66]  Yeah.
[418.76 --> 419.06]  Never.
[419.66 --> 421.40]  Yeah, and like, okay, good.
[421.50 --> 423.92]  I had no idea, because I was traveling that day.
[424.06 --> 428.72]  So today, I'm walking around the floor, and, like, I've heard rumors about it, but I haven't,
[428.76 --> 429.82]  I didn't know it actually launched.
[429.82 --> 433.66]  So, multiple people are coming up to me, like, oh, like, what do you think about it?
[433.74 --> 436.28]  Like, uh, are you, have you secretly tested it yet?
[436.32 --> 439.02]  And I'm sitting there being like, I have no idea what's happening.
[439.30 --> 441.48]  I had no idea it was announced or launched.
[441.62 --> 443.74]  I'm, I'm thinking that people are just going off of rumors.
[443.94 --> 446.38]  So I'm telling everyone no, and everyone thinks I'm lying.
[447.20 --> 448.00]  That's awesome.
[448.22 --> 450.92]  Everyone's like, oh, no, you're under NDA or whatever, you've been testing this forever.
[450.98 --> 453.10]  And I'm like, no, I actually have no idea.
[453.22 --> 454.96]  I literally know less about this than you do.
[454.96 --> 460.16]  So I will tell you that, uh, I know, I know why everyone thinks we're lying.
[460.32 --> 463.52]  Tech Gauge has, like, pictures of their card up already.
[464.18 --> 464.78]  Oh, my goodness.
[464.90 --> 466.44]  Here, I'll, I'll screen, I'll screen share.
[466.62 --> 470.38]  Uh, Tech Gauge, up close, look at GeForce GTX Titan X.
[470.88 --> 471.96]  Uh, hold on, let me just make sure.
[472.02 --> 473.40]  Yep, my, my screen share is working.
[473.48 --> 476.42]  I uninstalled that creative control panel, and it seems to be fine now.
[476.94 --> 477.52]  Oh, nice.
[477.60 --> 478.08]  So there it is.
[478.08 --> 478.80]  Wow, that's surprising.
[478.80 --> 481.94]  It comes in a box, uh, looks like a graphics card.
[481.94 --> 488.48]  Um, looks like it's using the same cool, they're just gonna keep making more and more of the card black.
[489.36 --> 489.60]  Yep.
[489.60 --> 493.12]  Until, until it's completely, like, next comes the IO shield, I guess.
[493.20 --> 494.88]  That'll be the Titan X Black Edition.
[495.66 --> 500.42]  Yeah, it'll be completely black, and then they're going to release the White Edition or something.
[500.64 --> 502.82]  Yeah, yeah, or, or, or, or, or something.
[503.30 --> 503.80]  Or something.
[503.80 --> 508.72]  And they'll just keep, they'll keep adding more black and, like, more green LEDs until we're suitably impressed.
[508.72 --> 512.08]  Um, so, yeah, the, the card has posed on camera.
[512.22 --> 517.76]  Um, I got a, I got a message, I got an email, uh, right before the show, where I asked, is ours in the mail?
[517.82 --> 519.28]  And I got a, I got a confirmation.
[520.10 --> 520.38]  So.
[520.52 --> 520.74]  Cool.
[521.12 --> 521.30]  Cool.
[521.48 --> 522.10]  No briefing.
[522.46 --> 523.32]  No driver.
[525.38 --> 526.16]  Cards in the mail.
[526.82 --> 527.88]  Just, just no nothing.
[528.70 --> 530.64]  Yeah, I'm, don't, oh wow, I see the lower third now.
[530.76 --> 531.36]  That looks really sharp.
[531.48 --> 534.10]  Don't ask us if we've got time, you know, not, none of that.
[534.18 --> 536.44]  Just put it in the mail, we'll deal with it.
[536.44 --> 539.50]  We don't have time, like, legitimately, not at all.
[539.70 --> 540.24]  I know.
[540.48 --> 542.42]  That's the best part of all of this, I think.
[543.16 --> 543.48]  That's fantastic.
[543.48 --> 544.70]  I'll tell you there's a holiday while you're gone.
[545.16 --> 547.54]  As if that's gonna be actually a holiday for me.
[548.56 --> 548.96]  Yeah.
[549.76 --> 550.66]  You know what, though?
[550.78 --> 553.42]  I, I filmed four videos yesterday.
[554.34 --> 554.64]  Wow.
[554.86 --> 555.24]  Four.
[555.60 --> 557.84]  And I plan to do something similar on Monday.
[557.92 --> 560.08]  I'm gonna be prepping a lot of stuff on, on the weekend.
[560.08 --> 564.10]  So I'm still gonna, I'm still gonna do my best to, to, to get you guys.
[564.16 --> 570.02]  Actually, maybe we should take this opportunity to, to tell the audience, kind of, what's, what's
[570.02 --> 574.64]  going on with why we need to be filming four videos a day and stuff like that right now.
[575.34 --> 580.62]  So, if you guys have heard of a video platform called Vessel, the first thing I need to say
[580.62 --> 582.48]  is don't sign up for it.
[583.34 --> 585.70]  Because we don't have a referral link yet.
[586.14 --> 587.62]  So wait for that.
[587.92 --> 588.04]  Yeah.
[588.54 --> 589.70]  So wait for that.
[590.58 --> 597.06]  Um, but basically the way Vessel works is it's gonna have, um, the same, well, in theory,
[597.26 --> 601.64]  this is what they're trying to do, it's gonna have the same creators as other online platforms
[601.64 --> 605.52]  like YouTube and even some, you know, more traditional celebrities.
[605.52 --> 611.24]  Except it'll offer early access and it's a subscription-based service and then the idea
[611.24 --> 617.14]  is that for the, what's in it for the creators is that people watching on Vessel come in at
[617.14 --> 620.98]  a, it's kind of like, I think the best analogy is the one that they gave us.
[621.00 --> 622.06]  And it's like, well, think about this.
[622.08 --> 626.38]  When you go watch a movie at the theater, to go watch with two people, it's like, you
[626.38 --> 629.00]  know, 30 bucks plus popcorn plus whatever.
[629.00 --> 633.92]  So that's, that's, if you want to see it like at the earliest possible opportunity with
[633.92 --> 636.90]  the best possible experience, then it's a lot more expensive.
[636.90 --> 640.74]  And if you're willing to wait a lot longer, eventually you can see it on TV subsidized
[640.74 --> 643.98]  by ads and that's that experience.
[644.18 --> 650.20]  So Vessel will be, it'll have things a little bit earlier, but basically it's the same content
[650.20 --> 653.44]  and everything that we release is still going to go to YouTube as well.
[653.96 --> 654.06]  So.
[654.20 --> 658.76]  And there, there will still be, uh, if you just ignore Vessel, there will actually be no
[658.76 --> 662.14]  noticeable change because we're always going to be uploading one video a day to YouTube.
[662.30 --> 663.30]  There will never be a gap.
[663.30 --> 665.10]  There will never be a difference there.
[665.28 --> 669.06]  So if you're just like, nope, going to ignore it, there will be no change.
[669.24 --> 670.42]  Everything will be totally fine.
[670.52 --> 676.82]  All the burden is on us to get a full week ahead on content before we go ahead and launch
[676.82 --> 678.04]  with, uh, with this platform.
[678.04 --> 679.90]  So we're still in talks with them.
[680.00 --> 680.86]  Nothing is signed.
[681.02 --> 686.32]  Nothing is confirmed, but it looks like we are, it looks like we are probably, uh, we
[686.32 --> 688.02]  are probably, we are probably interested.
[688.88 --> 690.76]  People are saying, no, don't do it.
[690.76 --> 693.76]  There's literally no change on the YouTube side.
[694.04 --> 694.24]  Yep.
[694.34 --> 696.02]  There will be no difference at all.
[696.02 --> 701.72]  You will get, you will get every video in your inbox every day.
[702.42 --> 702.52]  Yeah.
[702.60 --> 703.84]  And there will never be a gap.
[703.98 --> 705.74]  You will always be getting a video a day.
[706.20 --> 709.14]  Uh, WAN show will always be archived on YouTube.
[709.14 --> 713.10]  YouTube the, the like day at right after it's live, essentially.
[713.46 --> 713.64]  Yep.
[713.76 --> 717.68]  Um, all, all show coverage will be uploaded right when it's supposed to.
[718.42 --> 718.82]  Yeah.
[719.62 --> 720.84]  There will be no noticeable difference.
[720.92 --> 721.20]  That's fine.
[721.24 --> 724.18]  People are acting like they have to subscribe to vessel.
[724.28 --> 725.74]  You do not have to subscribe at all.
[725.98 --> 726.12]  At all.
[726.52 --> 728.38]  Um, if you choose to, then great.
[729.02 --> 731.08]  If you don't, then, then don't.
[731.20 --> 731.80]  That's fine too.
[732.28 --> 734.80]  So we've got people asking, will the videos be the same?
[734.80 --> 737.74]  Uh, yes, they will be the, they will have the same content.
[738.02 --> 739.12]  It'll be about the same stuff.
[739.20 --> 743.06]  It will literally be uploaded to YouTube after.
[743.46 --> 747.10]  So I guess that is, that's pretty much it for that.
[747.44 --> 750.12]  Let's go ahead and move into our first topic, shall we?
[750.14 --> 751.12]  Do you have the doc open and everything?
[751.78 --> 755.42]  I do, but I've had zero minutes to look at this at all.
[755.60 --> 755.96]  Awesome.
[756.30 --> 756.58]  Okay.
[756.58 --> 760.14]  Well, there's, uh, there's a quick one that I can, that I can cover for you while you,
[760.20 --> 762.26]  uh, while you go ahead and get caught up a little bit here.
[762.80 --> 763.20]  Sure.
[763.20 --> 766.62]  Let's go ahead and, uh, post this in the Twitch chat.
[767.92 --> 768.28]  Okay.
[768.66 --> 768.98]  Bippity.
[769.10 --> 771.18]  Oh, oh, it always signs me out.
[772.80 --> 775.82]  I just want to post a message in the Twitch chat.
[775.92 --> 777.68]  I should be able to do that anonymously.
[777.98 --> 779.86]  Uh, I can still do that from here.
[779.96 --> 780.32]  Can you?
[780.68 --> 781.92]  Are you trying to do the politicians one?
[782.34 --> 782.70]  Yeah.
[783.44 --> 783.66]  All right.
[783.68 --> 784.06]  I got it.
[784.28 --> 784.70]  You got it?
[784.72 --> 785.34]  You posted it already?
[786.02 --> 786.40]  All right.
[786.40 --> 787.48]  I will in like a second.
[788.08 --> 793.14]  Basically, um, now to be clear, the camera,
[793.20 --> 793.88]  the camera is not available.
[794.08 --> 796.16]  You have, you have got to be kidding me.
[796.92 --> 798.82]  This is, this is driving me crazy.
[798.94 --> 803.56]  I thought I had this screen capture thing worked out now where it was just, it was just
[803.56 --> 807.36]  going to work every time from now on, from now until the end of time.
[807.84 --> 808.16]  Never.
[808.16 --> 812.16]  And it looks like I do not get to have that particular experience.
[812.16 --> 813.86]  We are back.
[813.94 --> 815.22]  I at least very much hope so.
[815.26 --> 816.76]  I'm really sorry about that, guys.
[816.84 --> 823.90]  When I refresh a video input device, um, if I do it with a Blackmagic device, uh, usually
[823.90 --> 825.06]  the computer blue screens.
[825.06 --> 829.74]  So the fact that it only froze the application that time is actually an improvement.
[829.74 --> 830.14]  Progress.
[830.72 --> 831.12]  Yeah.
[831.56 --> 838.28]  Um, so what I was actually trying to refresh was my screen so I could bring up this Ars
[838.28 --> 839.32]  Technica article.
[839.68 --> 840.22]  Here we go.
[840.82 --> 841.30]  Boom.
[841.66 --> 842.04]  Okay.
[842.26 --> 848.20]  Now I think that, um, I think that sort of, it's a little bit sensationalist.
[848.28 --> 852.06]  Uh, Republicans' Internet Freedom Act would wipe out net neutrality.
[852.06 --> 857.14]  This is not something that the entire Republican Party is behind at all.
[857.28 --> 862.50]  I believe it's about 36, 30, 31.
[862.50 --> 863.64]  So not even a majority?
[863.94 --> 865.36]  So 30, 32.
[865.54 --> 867.18]  32 Republicans behind this.
[867.38 --> 869.90]  It's, um, uh, it's Marshall.
[869.90 --> 872.22]  Is that percent or amount of people?
[872.38 --> 872.78]  People.
[873.44 --> 873.86]  Okay.
[874.18 --> 874.42]  Yeah.
[874.42 --> 875.14]  So I have no idea.
[875.62 --> 881.60]  So basically, uh, Marsha Blackburn is filing the internet freedom, legislation she calls the
[881.60 --> 882.44]  internet freedom act.
[882.50 --> 888.84]  To be clear, that does not mean this is being signed into law, but it's basically throwing
[888.84 --> 891.48]  out pretty much everything the FCC is trying to do.
[891.86 --> 897.46]  Um, Ars goes ahead and brings up that in the latest election cycle, Blackburn received $25,000
[897.46 --> 903.74]  from an AT&T political action committee, $20,000 from a Comcast political action committee,
[903.74 --> 911.00]  $20,000 from a Cable Industry Association political action committee, and $15,000 from a Verizon
[911.00 --> 912.26]  political action committee.
[912.70 --> 917.82]  Um, so that comes to a total of, off the top of my head, $80,000.
[918.28 --> 922.42]  So I don't know what I should be more upset about at this point.
[922.70 --> 924.60]  Uh, well, I guess I'm not that upset.
[924.70 --> 928.82]  I'm Canadian, so this doesn't directly affect me, although it will at some point.
[928.82 --> 931.58]  He's, he's Canadian, so he's sorry that he's upset right now.
[931.58 --> 932.58]  Yeah, I'm sorry I'm upset.
[932.76 --> 933.84]  I don't know what's more upsetting.
[933.98 --> 941.14]  The fact that, um, that, that, that someone is just so obviously bought, I mean, fighting
[941.14 --> 947.06]  against net neutrality, so as aggressively as this legislation would, it's basically like,
[947.70 --> 952.90]  yeah, you know, how, however will the internet survive if we don't let the internet service
[952.90 --> 954.18]  providers be in charge of it?
[954.36 --> 957.52]  Dear, oh my goodness, what's going to happen?
[957.92 --> 960.80]  Um, like it's, it's, it's pretty bad.
[961.18 --> 965.68]  Um, and so I, again, so I don't know if I'm more upset that, that she's bought, or if I'm
[965.68 --> 970.80]  more upset that it only costs $80,000 every, you know, four years or every election cycle
[970.80 --> 974.88]  to, uh, to, to pee that completely in someone's pocket.
[975.58 --> 977.48]  Uh, I mean.
[977.58 --> 978.30]  It's kind of gross.
[978.30 --> 979.98]  That is sad.
[982.72 --> 983.08]  So.
[983.32 --> 983.72]  Yeah.
[983.98 --> 989.08]  See, like seeing stuff like this before house of cards, this is going to sound kind of weird
[989.08 --> 993.82]  before house of cards, I was always like, wow, like that's so crazy that this stuff could
[993.82 --> 994.22]  happen.
[994.22 --> 997.98]  And like, I know it's just a show, but now that I watch house of cards, I'm like, Hmm.
[998.84 --> 1001.62]  Every single one of them is bought by someone.
[1003.34 --> 1004.82]  I wonder who it is.
[1004.94 --> 1006.22]  I think I have you too loud again.
[1006.28 --> 1007.08]  Let me turn that down.
[1007.08 --> 1008.48]  There we go.
[1008.56 --> 1008.80]  All right.
[1008.86 --> 1011.90]  Hopefully everything is totally awesome this time.
[1011.94 --> 1014.86]  And I'm not going to accidentally refresh the intensity pro again.
[1015.36 --> 1019.68]  So we have more news on AMD free sync.
[1019.78 --> 1024.86]  Uh, do you want to go ahead and throw the, uh, the official AMD page, I guess, or something
[1024.86 --> 1025.50]  I always do.
[1025.50 --> 1027.38]  I always do the line of executives link.
[1027.48 --> 1027.90]  Oh, sure.
[1028.18 --> 1028.40]  Okay.
[1028.40 --> 1032.34]  Well, this was posted by Spartaman 64 and the last one is from Victoria's secret.
[1032.34 --> 1038.10]  But basically in summary, there's not actually a whole lot of new news here.
[1038.20 --> 1040.68]  Free sync works exactly the way we thought it did.
[1041.20 --> 1043.40]  Um, so variable refresh rate gaming.
[1044.06 --> 1045.18]  That's a good thing.
[1045.18 --> 1050.00]  By the way, it works anywhere from, uh, 30 to 144 FPS.
[1050.64 --> 1051.76]  Why AMD uses cookies?
[1051.96 --> 1052.44]  That's nice.
[1052.52 --> 1053.00]  Don't care.
[1053.52 --> 1059.14]  Um, this page is not letting me scroll for some reason.
[1059.14 --> 1062.32]  I am not having a good day today.
[1062.90 --> 1063.38]  No.
[1063.68 --> 1064.34]  At all.
[1064.96 --> 1067.26]  Actually, the rest of the day has gone pretty well so far.
[1067.44 --> 1067.96]  There we go.
[1068.04 --> 1069.44]  There's your...
[1069.44 --> 1070.92]  Where'd that scroll bar go?
[1072.46 --> 1072.90]  Okay.
[1073.00 --> 1075.00]  Page up, page down is my only choice.
[1075.32 --> 1076.72]  It's my only choice.
[1077.10 --> 1077.86]  You can do it.
[1078.02 --> 1079.02]  I believe in you, Linus.
[1079.12 --> 1082.08]  Anywhere from 30 to 144 hertz.
[1082.08 --> 1083.52]  It can refresh it.
[1083.90 --> 1084.98]  Linus growing tips.
[1084.98 --> 1090.10]  You gotta have an AMD GPU that supports it and a supported driver and a...
[1090.10 --> 1098.46]  And a display port 1.2a display that supports the optional adaptive sync spec.
[1098.80 --> 1101.18]  So, in a nutshell, it's exactly what we thought.
[1101.28 --> 1102.28]  It's officially launching.
[1102.74 --> 1105.36]  Um, so there you go.
[1105.50 --> 1108.16]  That's pretty much all I really have to say about that.
[1108.64 --> 1110.36]  Uh, this one's cool though.
[1110.56 --> 1112.14]  Valve has given us a date.
[1112.14 --> 1118.20]  This was posted by Victoria's Secret for the official Steam Machines launch.
[1118.36 --> 1122.92]  Uh, also Source 2 with Vulcan support is being announced.
[1123.04 --> 1127.34]  So, Steam Machines, uh, will include sort of the...
[1127.34 --> 1131.38]  Remember, guys, Valve originally did, like, that Steam Machine concept thing where they
[1131.38 --> 1134.10]  shipped out Steam Machines to a bunch of lucky people.
[1134.34 --> 1136.24]  They're not doing their own Steam Machine.
[1136.24 --> 1143.30]  Steam Machine is just a computer from someone like iBuyPower or Alienware that comes with
[1143.30 --> 1145.28]  SteamOS installed on it.
[1145.28 --> 1148.20]  Or stay tuned for a video on Zotax.
[1149.04 --> 1149.48]  Yeah.
[1149.86 --> 1150.78]  Oh, did you film that today?
[1151.26 --> 1151.82]  I did.
[1151.94 --> 1152.26]  Awesome.
[1152.42 --> 1155.54]  That is filmed and will be uploaded probably in the first wave.
[1155.66 --> 1156.94]  And yeah, it's launching in November.
[1157.20 --> 1158.48]  It actually looks super good.
[1158.54 --> 1160.90]  I'm not going to get too into it so that people actually watch the video.
[1161.54 --> 1161.94]  Awesome.
[1161.94 --> 1163.44]  It aesthetically looks really good.
[1163.54 --> 1167.66]  And they're bundling a lot of the Steam Machines that come out around that time with the Steam
[1167.66 --> 1172.36]  Controller, which was also announced in its final form at GDC as well.
[1172.52 --> 1172.88]  Yeah.
[1173.16 --> 1174.70]  So, uh, let me see if I can...
[1174.70 --> 1178.32]  Actually, I'm going to see if I can find some pics of the, uh, the final Steam Controller,
[1178.32 --> 1180.88]  uh, GDC 2015.
[1181.32 --> 1182.54]  I'll just try and find someone's article.
[1182.66 --> 1186.94]  So, they've made a lot of changes since the original Steam Controller.
[1187.08 --> 1189.42]  Actually, here, I'll finish up talking about Steam Machines first.
[1189.42 --> 1191.96]  So, to be clear, they're just PCs.
[1192.42 --> 1193.18]  They're just computers.
[1193.46 --> 1197.86]  They plug into your, your TV or realistically, you could plug one into your monitor if you
[1197.86 --> 1198.52]  felt like it.
[1198.92 --> 1204.48]  Um, they range in price from around console price points to, you know, $4,000, $5,000,
[1204.82 --> 1207.52]  depending on how balls to the wall you want to go with them.
[1207.52 --> 1208.84]  Because they're just a computer.
[1209.36 --> 1210.50]  Because they're just a computer.
[1210.82 --> 1216.40]  Um, it'll launch alongside both the Steam Controller that Luke just mentioned and Steam
[1216.40 --> 1222.74]  Link, which is actually kind of the, the, the, the, like, the, the actual piece, the biggest
[1222.74 --> 1225.84]  piece of news in my mind, to be perfectly honest.
[1225.84 --> 1226.20]  What is Steam Link?
[1226.38 --> 1227.14]  Steam Link.
[1227.24 --> 1228.60]  See, you have been disconnected.
[1228.80 --> 1229.36]  Steam Link.
[1229.44 --> 1229.68]  Yeah.
[1229.86 --> 1230.86]  Is really cool.
[1231.32 --> 1233.38]  It's going to be $50, apparently.
[1233.80 --> 1236.48]  Or, I think, I don't know if they actually said $50.
[1236.74 --> 1240.18]  I think they said price the same as the controller, which is $50.
[1240.18 --> 1241.30]  So, okay.
[1241.62 --> 1242.44]  So, I don't know.
[1242.50 --> 1244.48]  Maybe it ends up being $60 or, like, who knows.
[1245.08 --> 1245.64]  Around there.
[1245.76 --> 1245.92]  Yeah.
[1245.98 --> 1247.74]  It's going to be around that $50 price point.
[1248.18 --> 1251.68]  It supports 1080p 60Hz streaming.
[1252.00 --> 1256.60]  And then, basically, it's just a dedicated box for Steam in-home streaming.
[1257.38 --> 1258.64]  So, you can play games.
[1258.66 --> 1259.60]  1080p 60?
[1260.12 --> 1260.56]  Yes.
[1260.90 --> 1261.86]  So, better than the Doku.
[1262.48 --> 1264.56]  I was just going to say, oh.
[1265.20 --> 1266.22]  Oh, Doku.
[1266.22 --> 1266.94]  I'm better than them.
[1266.94 --> 1271.10]  So, it's cheaper than the Doku, Doku thing.
[1271.42 --> 1272.72]  And it's better.
[1273.74 --> 1274.22]  Yeah.
[1274.58 --> 1280.14]  So, Doku 2 or Doku Plus or whatever it is that they've got planned is now officially dead.
[1280.70 --> 1283.20]  And it won't just support game streaming.
[1283.38 --> 1287.42]  It'll also support streaming your desktop from another location.
[1287.64 --> 1287.94]  So, if you have...
[1288.52 --> 1292.14]  So, I mean, all the parts of the ecosystem are coming together.
[1292.14 --> 1297.96]  The thing that was missing was a super cheapo Chromecast level Steam in-home streaming thing.
[1298.04 --> 1298.64]  People have...
[1298.64 --> 1300.88]  I think people have played around with it on the Raspberry Pi.
[1301.26 --> 1303.52]  I don't think the experience was that great.
[1303.68 --> 1305.38]  I haven't seen anything about Pi 2.
[1306.06 --> 1314.12]  But this at $50 with an Ethernet port in a couple USB ports for controllers or mouse and keyboard or whatever else.
[1314.44 --> 1318.34]  And then HDMI looks like pretty much the bee's knees.
[1318.34 --> 1319.34]  That sounds awesome.
[1319.68 --> 1319.94]  Yeah.
[1320.24 --> 1321.56]  At $50, that's awesome.
[1322.30 --> 1322.50]  Yeah.
[1322.66 --> 1323.58]  That is exactly.
[1323.72 --> 1323.88]  Yeah.
[1324.98 --> 1336.64]  So, like, to me, that kills all but the highest end TV-attached devices that are designed to stream from computers.
[1336.96 --> 1343.28]  And I'll talk more about Nvidia Shield soon because that still kind of has a place and there's a discussion to be had there.
[1343.44 --> 1345.68]  But would you buy a Steam machine at this point?
[1347.30 --> 1347.78]  No.
[1348.34 --> 1350.92]  I probably wasn't going to buy a Steam machine anyways.
[1350.92 --> 1353.80]  Because I want to make a Mineral Oil Home Theater PC.
[1354.00 --> 1358.92]  But now I don't know how applicable that is because this Steam Link thing actually sounds awesome.
[1359.32 --> 1361.06]  And, like, one really cool thing...
[1361.06 --> 1363.60]  I've been doing some amount of research on receivers lately.
[1363.72 --> 1365.42]  Not a huge amount, but a little bit.
[1365.42 --> 1383.10]  And the second that you get to anything that's going to be better than something that I could just buy from, like, a thrift store or a second-hand store because receivers haven't really gotten that much crazy better, as far as I can tell, is stuff like networking.
[1383.10 --> 1383.90]  Mm-hmm.
[1383.90 --> 1392.24]  So if I could just have one of these hooked up to my receiver and just Bluetooth to that through my phone, then I could just control the songs and stuff through there.
[1392.60 --> 1397.88]  And just use Power Amp on my phone, pull it off my NAS because I now have a connected thing.
[1398.18 --> 1398.66]  Like, I don't know.
[1398.72 --> 1399.16]  That's awesome.
[1399.16 --> 1399.96]  Yeah.
[1399.96 --> 1400.04]  Yeah.
[1400.18 --> 1403.74]  Like, I am still one of those people who has a Media Center PC.
[1404.38 --> 1409.36]  But even I am looking at some of these solutions and kind of going, well, shoot.
[1409.86 --> 1414.36]  Am I ever actually sitting in front of my computer upstairs while I sit on my couch?
[1415.04 --> 1415.24]  Yeah.
[1415.66 --> 1416.88]  There's still a place.
[1417.06 --> 1423.48]  Like, people who want to run games at 4K on their 4K TV are not going to be served by a device like this.
[1423.48 --> 1424.74]  But I'm going to go ahead.
[1424.88 --> 1426.78]  I'm going to say it.
[1427.74 --> 1431.30]  High contrast is way more important than 4K.
[1431.56 --> 1439.38]  A quality display from the kind of distance that I sit from my TV, a quality display is way more important than 4K.
[1439.50 --> 1443.18]  4K has not tempted me to upgrade to it personally.
[1443.44 --> 1452.26]  It's the kind of thing I love to drool over and, like, walking around at CES with, like, 4K curved this and 4K OLED that and, like, 4K up your butt.
[1452.50 --> 1452.94]  Whatever.
[1452.94 --> 1457.74]  All the 4K is, like, exciting and sweet and, like, I geek out over that stuff.
[1457.82 --> 1459.24]  But I'm not going to pay for it yet.
[1460.20 --> 1460.40]  Yeah.
[1460.76 --> 1464.68]  One thing I have to worry about with this is any input latency.
[1465.84 --> 1466.94]  So, I...
[1467.48 --> 1468.34]  Blah, blah, blah.
[1468.40 --> 1469.48]  I forget what they were...
[1469.48 --> 1470.94]  I forget what it is exactly.
[1471.88 --> 1474.94]  But if it's anything like Steam and Home Streaming, okay.
[1475.60 --> 1482.28]  If you're, like, competitive CSGO dude like you or Ed or whatever else, nah, man.
[1483.18 --> 1483.70]  But...
[1483.70 --> 1487.42]  I'm just saying, like, yeah, like, you're right.
[1487.50 --> 1490.10]  Like, obviously, like, playing Civ or whatever would be great on this.
[1490.42 --> 1491.16]  Civ or XCOM.
[1491.24 --> 1494.18]  Anything that's, like, turn-based or whatever will be fine.
[1494.46 --> 1497.18]  But how many games will be an issue?
[1497.24 --> 1499.58]  I want to get my hands on it, essentially, and try.
[1499.58 --> 1502.12]  Like, it sounds really compelling.
[1502.26 --> 1506.24]  But I'm not sure if it's going to replace home theater PCs for everyone, is essentially what I'm trying to say.
[1506.48 --> 1506.58]  Yeah.
[1506.58 --> 1508.06]  I think you do it for a lot of people.
[1508.26 --> 1514.52]  Like, my dad would now be able to ditch the home theater PC that he has because it's giant.
[1514.52 --> 1517.08]  And then use this instead.
[1517.20 --> 1518.00]  Because that would be great.
[1518.46 --> 1521.54]  Because if my dad's going to play any games, it'll be, like...
[1521.54 --> 1522.70]  What is that game called?
[1522.92 --> 1523.20]  Rocksmith?
[1523.70 --> 1524.46]  I think it's Rocksmith.
[1525.44 --> 1527.46]  That game that you can play with an actual guitar.
[1527.98 --> 1528.28]  Okay.
[1528.42 --> 1529.12]  And it's kind of like Rock Band.
[1529.38 --> 1529.58]  Yeah.
[1529.58 --> 1531.60]  So, he'll play, like, that or, like, a racing game.
[1531.72 --> 1533.44]  So, he'll probably be fine with either one.
[1534.62 --> 1536.40]  So, he could just get the Steam link.
[1536.52 --> 1537.76]  But it might not work for everybody.
[1538.62 --> 1538.98]  Yeah.
[1539.12 --> 1541.34]  So, I'm excited to see where it goes.
[1541.50 --> 1542.52]  I mean, it's...
[1542.52 --> 1545.32]  Like you said, it's not for everyone.
[1545.46 --> 1546.20]  You want 4K.
[1546.46 --> 1548.74]  You want, like, the absolute best input latency.
[1549.10 --> 1549.56]  You want this.
[1549.62 --> 1550.10]  You want that.
[1550.18 --> 1550.64]  Okay, fine.
[1550.70 --> 1551.68]  Well, then, you've got to pay.
[1551.68 --> 1563.42]  But for $50, for 1080p60 with, you know, sort of sub, you know, 60 milliseconds of extra latency, it's looking pretty compelling.
[1563.54 --> 1565.24]  And let's talk a little bit about the Steam Controller.
[1565.38 --> 1567.20]  So, this article is from IGN.
[1567.22 --> 1571.20]  I'm just going to pull up this still of what we're looking at here.
[1571.32 --> 1576.64]  So, now, the original Steam Controller just had the two haptic feedback pads.
[1576.64 --> 1589.36]  And Valve's concept was that they wanted you to use that as your button inputs and as your D-pad slash joysticks, analog stick, whatever you want to call it.
[1589.40 --> 1591.84]  They wanted all the control to be through the haptic pads.
[1592.30 --> 1594.10]  Now, it's still got that.
[1594.72 --> 1595.98]  And they are sort of...
[1595.98 --> 1604.80]  We've seen a lot of different iterations with things like the positions swapped around for a joystick versus a haptic pad or buttons here or buttons there.
[1604.80 --> 1607.30]  So, now, this is it.
[1607.62 --> 1612.26]  It has the two haptic pads on the outside in what look like the more ergonomic positions.
[1612.66 --> 1620.80]  And then it has a single joystick on the left and an A, B, X, Y layout of buttons that looks like it's ripped straight off an Xbox controller.
[1621.34 --> 1626.42]  With a Steam button in the middle, select and start or back and forward or whatever you want to call those.
[1626.52 --> 1628.90]  And then four trigger buttons on the shoulders.
[1629.06 --> 1632.90]  And then I believe there's two squeeze buttons on the bottom as well.
[1633.34 --> 1634.68]  Luke, what's your take on this?
[1634.68 --> 1635.24]  You've seen it, right?
[1636.82 --> 1637.70]  I've seen it.
[1637.78 --> 1639.80]  Yeah, I have it up on stream right now, actually.
[1640.06 --> 1643.60]  Because I'm trying to follow along on the stream because I don't really know what you're looking at.
[1644.30 --> 1644.66]  Awesome.
[1645.60 --> 1646.42]  I don't know.
[1646.68 --> 1650.68]  I am probably still going to stick with my 360 controller thing.
[1650.68 --> 1656.44]  And I'll maintain what I said, actually, when they first started showing off Steam controller things.
[1656.62 --> 1660.90]  Which is, it might make sense for games that I normally wouldn't want to play with a controller.
[1662.36 --> 1662.50]  Yeah.
[1662.50 --> 1667.26]  So most games that I want to play, like an action game, if I want to play Assassin's Creed, a lot of times I'll play with a controller.
[1667.90 --> 1671.82]  I didn't play Shadow of Mordor with a controller, but I heard it was a pretty good experience.
[1672.24 --> 1674.68]  Stuff like racing games, I would always play with a controller.
[1675.00 --> 1677.32]  Yeah, third person's always pretty good with a controller.
[1677.32 --> 1682.16]  Yeah, third person action fighting, I find, usually does well with a controller.
[1682.40 --> 1684.58]  Like Tomb Raider 2013, I hardly touched it.
[1684.88 --> 1690.76]  Every time I try to benchmark that damn game and I have to play it with a keyboard and mouse, I'm like, oh crap, I don't know how to do anything.
[1691.68 --> 1692.34]  And I beat the game!
[1693.38 --> 1694.02]  Yeah, yeah.
[1694.10 --> 1702.22]  The only thing I don't like in that game is that there's free aiming with guns and bows, which I always have an issue with.
[1702.32 --> 1703.08]  Oh, with the controller?
[1703.36 --> 1704.12]  You know what?
[1704.22 --> 1706.74]  By the end of that game, I was getting not bad, actually.
[1706.74 --> 1708.66]  I believe you, I just suck.
[1708.90 --> 1711.66]  So I want to use a keyboard and mouse because I can be...
[1711.66 --> 1713.16]  The truth!
[1713.54 --> 1717.86]  The ugly truth that no PC gamer wants to tell you.
[1718.76 --> 1723.80]  I guess I just have to use a keyboard and mouse because I suck with a controller.
[1724.46 --> 1726.84]  You heard it here first, folks!
[1727.76 --> 1728.86]  You heard it here first!
[1729.32 --> 1731.06]  That reminds me of some of those video clips.
[1731.06 --> 1732.44]  PC gamers are just losers.
[1733.10 --> 1735.02]  Those video clips that I was doing today, actually.
[1735.02 --> 1736.02]  I did quite a few of those.
[1736.74 --> 1738.52]  I don't know if we're talking about that.
[1738.52 --> 1738.84]  No!
[1738.98 --> 1740.32]  We are not teasing that.
[1740.40 --> 1741.86]  That is going to be freaking awesome.
[1741.92 --> 1743.18]  Is it going to be as awesome as I think?
[1744.52 --> 1747.28]  The first couple, I think I was too tame.
[1747.94 --> 1748.98]  And I've been...
[1748.98 --> 1749.94]  I've been...
[1749.94 --> 1751.66]  I've had to apologize to a few people now.
[1752.54 --> 1752.98]  Nice!
[1753.70 --> 1754.66]  Oh, I'm excited!
[1755.40 --> 1756.66]  Those are going to be awesome videos.
[1758.34 --> 1758.92]  Freaking awesome.
[1758.92 --> 1761.54]  Part of my problem right now is that...
[1761.54 --> 1764.28]  I'm trying not to leak this too much.
[1764.60 --> 1766.36]  No one is lashing back at all.
[1766.98 --> 1767.32]  Really?
[1767.82 --> 1769.36]  So it's just really awkward.
[1770.54 --> 1770.94]  Yeah.
[1771.62 --> 1772.10]  Nice!
[1772.10 --> 1773.48]  I'll hammer into someone and they'll just be like,
[1773.60 --> 1774.80]  Oh, okay.
[1775.58 --> 1776.38]  It's like...
[1776.38 --> 1777.46]  Crap.
[1779.74 --> 1780.78]  Okay, that's awkward.
[1781.04 --> 1782.54]  I don't know if that's better or worse.
[1782.54 --> 1783.62]  Okay, you guys.
[1783.72 --> 1785.62]  These videos are on the schedule for...
[1785.62 --> 1788.46]  I think the first one comes out Monday midnight.
[1789.12 --> 1791.66]  And then I think the second one comes out Tuesday midnight.
[1791.86 --> 1793.42]  So stay tuned.
[1793.52 --> 1795.50]  Because these are going to be awesome videos.
[1795.60 --> 1799.48]  So basically Luke going supreme troll on people.
[1799.64 --> 1800.72]  It's going to be amazing.
[1801.86 --> 1804.40]  Alright, let's go ahead and move on, I guess.
[1804.50 --> 1806.90]  Oh, Source 2 will be free to all content developers.
[1807.02 --> 1807.74]  Kind of a big deal.
[1808.16 --> 1808.80]  That's awesome.
[1808.86 --> 1810.28]  Probably shouldn't miss that.
[1810.28 --> 1818.06]  So I guess I would like to draw a bit of a conclusion about Steam Machine here before we move on though.
[1819.46 --> 1820.56]  I'm going to go ahead.
[1820.64 --> 1824.22]  I'm going to say dead in the water about Steam OS.
[1824.94 --> 1831.72]  Yeah, Valve announced a lot of upcoming games that are going to be getting Linux support, which is super cool.
[1833.58 --> 1836.66]  I don't understand the relevance.
[1836.66 --> 1845.16]  As a standalone product that exists in a vacuum, Steam OS and a Steam machine that runs Steam OS makes sense.
[1845.66 --> 1848.32]  Because it's like, okay, I don't have to pay for an OS.
[1848.52 --> 1850.36]  I just saved some money on my computer.
[1851.18 --> 1851.24]  Yep.
[1851.24 --> 1863.18]  But with the Steam link at 50 bucks delivering in my mind 90% of the experience of what a dedicated Steam box can do.
[1863.24 --> 1867.10]  Because remember, you're not buying a TV with 144 hertz refresh rate.
[1867.28 --> 1873.40]  There is no compelling reason to have higher than 60 FPS on your TV.
[1873.40 --> 1876.28]  Anyway, we're talking about a little bit of extra latency.
[1876.48 --> 1879.84]  Most couch optimized games are not playing CSGO on the couch.
[1880.28 --> 1884.74]  Most couch optimized games are going to be a more casual experience anyway.
[1885.68 --> 1888.94]  Like Assassin's Creed or a driving game or whatever.
[1889.04 --> 1889.46]  That's right.
[1889.56 --> 1890.04]  Exactly.
[1890.04 --> 1897.64]  So why do I need to have this utmost absolute best performance when I can just for 50 bucks link up to a PC somewhere else?
[1898.06 --> 1906.02]  And then as if as like kind of the final nail in the coffin, as if game compatibility for the ones that are you can actually run locally isn't bad enough.
[1906.08 --> 1906.86]  And yes, it's getting better.
[1906.98 --> 1908.46]  But let's face it.
[1908.50 --> 1909.58]  It's not that great.
[1909.58 --> 1920.66]  Like NVIDIA's news this week with the Shield console is the answer to who needs like is the answer for people who want to stream 4K.
[1921.36 --> 1922.20]  Well, not OK.
[1922.44 --> 1923.72]  Not not Shield console.
[1923.96 --> 1925.16]  I didn't hear anything.
[1925.46 --> 1927.00]  You haven't heard about the Shield console?
[1927.68 --> 1928.16]  No.
[1928.36 --> 1929.26]  OK, it doesn't.
[1929.36 --> 1931.96]  OK, to be clear, to be clear, it doesn't do it yet.
[1932.36 --> 1935.54]  But Steam machines aren't coming until.
[1937.06 --> 1938.98]  Oh, I think November.
[1938.98 --> 1939.56]  November, right?
[1939.58 --> 1939.72]  Yeah.
[1939.88 --> 1941.12]  Steam machines aren't coming until November.
[1941.34 --> 1943.66]  Now, NVIDIA, look how quickly they've been iterating.
[1943.78 --> 1950.84]  So Shield console is 200 bucks and it doesn't stream games in 4K, but it'll do 1080p 60 games.
[1950.94 --> 1952.02]  If I if I recall correctly.
[1952.08 --> 1952.30]  Hold on.
[1952.38 --> 1953.22]  I might be wrong.
[1953.46 --> 1954.10]  I might.
[1954.38 --> 1955.24]  I might be wrong.
[1956.16 --> 1958.46]  Capable of decoding 4K 60 FPS.
[1958.46 --> 1969.30]  So I actually I can't think of a of a clear reason why it couldn't actually support 4K game stream at some point, because it can decode 4K.
[1969.30 --> 1970.30]  So this will handle all your 4K.
[1970.30 --> 1973.10]  So this will handle all your 4K Netflix.
[1973.60 --> 1975.88]  It'll handle any other 4K YouTube.
[1976.12 --> 1978.16]  It'll handle any other kind of 4K streaming service.
[1978.16 --> 1980.08]  And then again for games.
[1980.08 --> 1984.06]  I don't think that 4K gaming is there yet.
[1984.56 --> 1985.08]  Personally.
[1985.30 --> 1985.42]  Right.
[1985.72 --> 1991.58]  Gaming at 4K, especially the latest AAA titles, is not a tremendous experience.
[1991.58 --> 1997.32]  So the additional network load, the additional processing load, the additional hardware that you have to buy for your computer.
[1997.84 --> 2001.50]  4K, 4K streamed gaming is not happening yet.
[2001.62 --> 2004.08]  4K gaming in general is not happening yet.
[2004.28 --> 2005.74]  Even with Titan X.
[2006.74 --> 2007.22]  So.
[2009.16 --> 2012.08]  Well, it's happening, just not to the degree that it should be.
[2012.08 --> 2015.68]  It's not good enough that I'm ready to go for it, personally.
[2015.84 --> 2021.20]  I would just run 1080p and make sure I never dip below 60 so I don't see those dips and stutters.
[2021.36 --> 2021.82]  Because it's not like.
[2023.34 --> 2023.74]  Yeah.
[2023.98 --> 2026.30]  It's not like you're getting FreeSync or G-Sync on your TV.
[2026.60 --> 2027.88]  So you're going to see that stutter.
[2028.06 --> 2028.76]  It's going to happen.
[2029.22 --> 2033.20]  And I would rather have the lower resolution than the hiccups and stutters.
[2033.20 --> 2034.20]  Yeah.
[2035.10 --> 2045.38]  So I think that because this can handle the 4K media experience and can also do 1080p, 60fps streaming,
[2045.90 --> 2054.00]  I think that there are more compelling options than a Steam machine all over the place.
[2054.20 --> 2055.48]  And even from Valve themselves.
[2056.72 --> 2059.66]  So, I mean, I might try out the controller just to give it a shot.
[2059.66 --> 2064.28]  But we've yet to see, in my mind, we've yet to see a controller better than the Xbox 360.
[2064.38 --> 2065.72]  The Xbox One 1 is okay.
[2066.02 --> 2067.52]  I don't like the DualShock shape.
[2067.60 --> 2069.10]  I get cramps in my hands eventually.
[2069.44 --> 2069.62]  Yeah.
[2069.98 --> 2071.84]  NVIDIA's controller is okay.
[2072.26 --> 2075.02]  It's not better than an Xbox 360 controller by any means.
[2075.08 --> 2076.30]  I like the integrated touchscreen.
[2076.48 --> 2076.98]  That's cool.
[2077.18 --> 2083.18]  So I really want to see if Valve managed to figure out the tactile feedback of the buttons.
[2083.18 --> 2087.18]  But there's a thing I already really don't like about the Valve controller or the Steam controller.
[2087.18 --> 2091.02]  And that is the positioning of the buttons and the joystick.
[2091.28 --> 2093.38]  And also the fact that it outright doesn't have a D-pad.
[2094.20 --> 2098.68]  You know, if you want to play any emulated older console games or anything like that,
[2098.78 --> 2103.10]  well, go die in a fire because you're not doing it on that controller.
[2103.30 --> 2103.76]  That's not happening.
[2105.72 --> 2107.12]  And that's something that I actually do.
[2107.12 --> 2113.82]  You know, I probably do more retro gaming on my TV than I do current gaming on my TV.
[2113.94 --> 2114.88]  So that's a big deal for me.
[2114.96 --> 2116.58]  I do most of my current gaming on my portable.
[2118.10 --> 2120.70]  Someone says, face it, Linus, you don't like any controllers.
[2121.12 --> 2122.08]  Absolutely not true.
[2122.18 --> 2124.02]  The Super Nintendo controller is exceptional.
[2124.56 --> 2127.52]  I have like 15-year-old Super Nintendo controller.
[2127.62 --> 2127.88]  Well, no.
[2127.94 --> 2128.96]  How old would they be older than that?
[2129.02 --> 2135.42]  I have 20-year-old Super Nintendo controllers that still have great tactile response on the buttons and D-pad.
[2135.92 --> 2139.80]  Show me another controller that has held up that well to the test of time.
[2139.80 --> 2146.36]  I also really like the Xbox 360 controller, although the D-pad is garbage, as the Twitch chat is exploding with.
[2146.46 --> 2152.78]  So I have an SNES controller next to my, that's actually plugged directly into my media PC.
[2153.10 --> 2157.12]  And then I have an Xbox 360 wireless controller that is wirelessly connected to it.
[2157.12 --> 2158.88]  And that takes care of all of my controller needs.
[2159.98 --> 2160.26]  Yeah.
[2160.26 --> 2165.34]  So we'll get into the NVIDIA thing a little bit more lately.
[2165.72 --> 2166.88]  Or, lately, later.
[2167.28 --> 2167.56]  Later.
[2167.98 --> 2168.62]  Yeah, later.
[2168.98 --> 2171.68]  Mantle SDK will be available to everyone this month.
[2171.88 --> 2173.92]  So that's cool if you're into that.
[2173.98 --> 2176.98]  That was posted by Venati Yad Gaming.
[2176.98 --> 2188.14]  Personally, even though game developer support has actually been way better than I ever expected for Mantle, I still don't see this going anywhere.
[2189.24 --> 2196.02]  DirectX 12 has to be, and, I mean, it's the Kronos Group has most of Mantle anyway.
[2196.62 --> 2200.98]  Microsoft has included aspects of Mantle in the upcoming DirectX 12.
[2201.98 --> 2203.62]  Or in the DirectX 12.
[2203.62 --> 2207.92]  Like, Mantle's going to have to differentiate itself in a pretty spectacular way.
[2208.14 --> 2214.44]  And AMD seems determined for it to not be very different from DirectX and OpenGL as we move forward.
[2214.70 --> 2216.20]  So, like, Mantle's cool.
[2216.40 --> 2220.70]  And I think it was, it lit a fire under the industry and created hype amongst users.
[2220.80 --> 2229.54]  It created user demand for these low-level APIs that most users would never even have an inkling of an understanding as to why they were important.
[2229.90 --> 2232.66]  And AMD did a great thing for the industry there.
[2232.66 --> 2239.72]  But DirectX 12 is going to have to completely fall on its face for Mantle to be relevant at all moving forward.
[2241.04 --> 2243.88]  And they had DirectX 12 demos at GDC as well.
[2244.84 --> 2248.96]  They had, like, side-by-side between 11 and 12 that were actually pretty impressive.
[2249.14 --> 2250.46]  I did know about that.
[2250.76 --> 2251.66]  It's looking pretty good.
[2251.66 --> 2254.86]  Oh, wait.
[2254.96 --> 2259.08]  That one was posted by, shoot, I hate scrolling in Google Sheets.
[2259.14 --> 2259.86]  Oh, I already said that.
[2259.96 --> 2260.12]  All right.
[2260.18 --> 2261.00]  I've got another one.
[2261.16 --> 2261.56]  Oh, wait.
[2261.58 --> 2262.64]  Are you posting these in the chat?
[2263.74 --> 2263.94]  Yep.
[2264.26 --> 2264.50]  Okay.
[2264.56 --> 2264.82]  Awesome.
[2265.16 --> 2265.74]  Next one.
[2265.80 --> 2266.48]  This is a rumor.
[2266.74 --> 2271.42]  Google is reportedly preparing Android Wear for iPhone and iPad.
[2271.42 --> 2274.62]  This is big.
[2274.72 --> 2275.48]  So I'm going to go ahead.
[2275.56 --> 2276.42]  I'll bring this up.
[2276.48 --> 2277.60]  So this is on MacRumors.
[2277.68 --> 2278.76]  This is not confirmed.
[2278.94 --> 2280.56]  This is a rumor.
[2280.56 --> 2285.56]  But there's a developer that's managed to sync notifications between iPhone and Android Wear.
[2286.68 --> 2289.30]  Method involves using a protocol used by Pebble Watch.
[2289.38 --> 2291.32]  Blippity bloopity, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2291.96 --> 2293.98]  This would be huge.
[2294.32 --> 2298.90]  Because with some of the rumors circulating about the Apple Watch and its battery life,
[2298.96 --> 2303.10]  although there's a new rumor that says five hours of screen on time,
[2303.54 --> 2308.72]  which is actually significantly better than the three to four that we were hearing before,
[2308.72 --> 2316.10]  that suggests that the Apple Watch might not be as much of a turd as I was sort of predicting that it would be.
[2316.46 --> 2319.58]  If Android Wear devices can be used cross-platform,
[2319.82 --> 2322.62]  Apple's going to have a real hard time selling me an Apple Watch.
[2322.74 --> 2323.64]  That is for sure.
[2323.74 --> 2325.82]  Because especially at the prices we're looking at,
[2326.06 --> 2327.68]  there's rumored pricing for the Apple Watch.
[2327.68 --> 2334.16]  Sports is rumored to be $349 with the metal versions coming in at I think it was $600 or $700
[2334.16 --> 2337.90]  and the all gold version over $15,000.
[2337.90 --> 2342.48]  If Apple is going to expect me to spend $700 on a watch,
[2342.62 --> 2345.68]  then I'm going to use whatever damn phone I want,
[2346.26 --> 2348.92]  and I'm going to have my notifications synced, damn it.
[2349.18 --> 2350.66]  That is how it is going to work.
[2350.76 --> 2355.10]  Otherwise, that is a lot to ask me to commit to in one ecosystem.
[2355.64 --> 2356.88]  Right. Yeah.
[2356.88 --> 2362.52]  So, I mean, what else is there to really say about that?
[2363.56 --> 2368.16]  The developer claims that no jailbreaking was required in order to make that work.
[2372.16 --> 2372.54]  Yeah.
[2373.54 --> 2375.84]  I'm surprised no jailbreaking was required.
[2376.82 --> 2377.52]  That's cool.
[2377.86 --> 2378.54]  I'm just surprised.
[2378.66 --> 2379.18]  Yeah, super cool.
[2379.18 --> 2381.06]  Well, it works apparently similarly to Pebble,
[2381.14 --> 2382.94]  which I guess is a good time for us to get into.
[2383.80 --> 2391.66]  Pebble is like, you can just tell what a bigger and more organized company they have become
[2391.66 --> 2393.80]  since they first launched the Pebble.
[2393.80 --> 2399.70]  So, like, this Kickstarter campaign is so beautifully orchestrated and planned,
[2399.86 --> 2401.96]  so originally it's like, here's the Pebble time.
[2402.26 --> 2405.38]  It's awesome because color display up to, I think it's,
[2405.74 --> 2409.80]  I don't know if it's only the time steal that gets up to 10 hours, 10 days of battery.
[2410.36 --> 2410.78]  I forget.
[2411.24 --> 2413.52]  I think Pebble time also has a longer battery life,
[2413.64 --> 2414.84]  but forgive me if I'm wrong.
[2415.18 --> 2419.42]  This new, you know, notification management system, blah, blah, blah.
[2419.42 --> 2419.86]  That's amazing.
[2419.94 --> 2420.48]  You should get one.
[2421.48 --> 2424.34]  They've raised, I think, is it 16 or 18 million on Kickstarter,
[2424.50 --> 2430.20]  making it by far, by far the most funded Kickstarter campaign ever.
[2430.72 --> 2433.84]  And now they're coming right back at us the next week.
[2433.94 --> 2438.44]  Pebble time steal, which looks outstanding.
[2439.62 --> 2443.04]  Well, that's what I called out during the show when we were talking about that.
[2443.10 --> 2446.46]  I was like, it doesn't look like they have a metal band in their Kickstarter.
[2446.56 --> 2447.50]  And I was like, that's weird.
[2447.78 --> 2448.84]  And then, yeah, now they do.
[2448.84 --> 2451.64]  And this was posted by the Strict9 on the forum.
[2451.72 --> 2453.44]  I'm just going to go ahead and pull this baby up.
[2453.86 --> 2454.90]  It looks bananas.
[2455.06 --> 2458.10]  Actually, it looks very Apple Watch-esque,
[2458.68 --> 2463.36]  which is either a huge blow to the Apple Watch
[2463.36 --> 2467.90]  or a huge kudos to Pebble for coming up with such a beautiful design
[2467.90 --> 2472.34]  that's going to come in at, I think it's $299 is going to be the street price.
[2472.64 --> 2473.90]  Oh, yeah, it gets better than that.
[2473.90 --> 2481.40]  So, you know that whole Project Aura thing from Google where it's like, yeah, modular phones.
[2481.54 --> 2483.24]  Well, bam, modular watch.
[2483.32 --> 2484.40]  This looks amazing.
[2484.58 --> 2487.54]  Pebble time is going to support what they're calling smart straps.
[2487.54 --> 2496.02]  So, your smart strap could contain extra sensors for jogging or a bigger battery.
[2496.52 --> 2496.88]  Oh, wow.
[2496.88 --> 2499.26]  They're saying you can swap them in 5 to 10 seconds.
[2499.26 --> 2502.62]  So, you could actually have multiple smart straps depending on what you're doing.
[2502.84 --> 2502.92]  Oh, wow.
[2502.92 --> 2505.24]  Yeah, that is like...
[2505.24 --> 2509.80]  If you could have like a heart rate sensor one or an extended battery one,
[2509.88 --> 2511.52]  I think that's all I'd even really want.
[2511.64 --> 2511.96]  Yeah, man.
[2511.96 --> 2515.00]  Because I could be like, oh, I'm working out and then, oh, all the other time
[2515.00 --> 2516.32]  because I don't like charging things.
[2516.38 --> 2519.16]  That is some goosebumps stuff right there.
[2519.58 --> 2520.86]  Like, imagining what...
[2520.86 --> 2523.50]  Because you look at what developers managed to do with the Pebble,
[2523.60 --> 2525.18]  and no disrespect to Pebble.
[2525.62 --> 2526.72]  They were a young company.
[2526.72 --> 2533.12]  It was successful because the smartwatch market was completely in its infancy.
[2533.22 --> 2534.32]  The Pebble was not amazing.
[2535.20 --> 2540.04]  I was not the only one to have an issue with a Pebble eventually.
[2540.54 --> 2543.22]  Mine started like bugging out on the display.
[2543.42 --> 2545.86]  In their defense, and the reason that I haven't really brought it up,
[2546.02 --> 2548.08]  their customer support was outstanding.
[2548.56 --> 2550.44]  They didn't even make me send my old one back.
[2550.54 --> 2553.28]  They just were like, can you send us a picture of the display garbled?
[2553.48 --> 2554.14]  I sent it.
[2554.20 --> 2555.92]  There was a new Pebble at my door within a week.
[2556.76 --> 2557.16]  Awesome.
[2557.34 --> 2559.32]  They did a great job as far as that was concerned.
[2559.42 --> 2563.02]  But the Pebble was not as complete or polished a product as this.
[2563.04 --> 2565.30]  And you look at what developers were able to do with that thing.
[2565.86 --> 2566.10]  Yeah.
[2566.18 --> 2567.66]  There was not a lot of hardware there.
[2568.02 --> 2570.50]  Well, now we're talking.
[2570.64 --> 2571.44]  Now we're talking.
[2571.56 --> 2572.64]  It's got a microphone.
[2572.94 --> 2573.94]  It's got smart straps.
[2574.18 --> 2575.90]  I mean, are we going to see smart straps with speakers?
[2576.46 --> 2576.82]  Cameras?
[2577.04 --> 2577.62]  I don't know.
[2577.74 --> 2578.06]  Oh.
[2578.40 --> 2579.10]  Who knows?
[2580.34 --> 2580.70]  Speakers?
[2580.70 --> 2581.66]  That could be a thing.
[2582.12 --> 2583.32]  I have no idea.
[2583.42 --> 2585.74]  Are we going to see smart straps with touch interfaces?
[2585.92 --> 2588.30]  So you could like do something.
[2588.56 --> 2593.24]  They're suggesting things like GPS and NFC could be built into this.
[2593.52 --> 2595.34]  Like instead of this is so smart.
[2595.40 --> 2596.90]  Instead of putting all the doodads in the watch.
[2596.96 --> 2598.56]  Like I think this is Apple's mistake.
[2598.76 --> 2602.62]  They're trying to put so much in that watch.
[2602.62 --> 2609.60]  We want it to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and NFC and a display and a freaking dial on the side and a new interface.
[2609.72 --> 2610.74]  And we're going to do all this stuff.
[2610.78 --> 2611.98]  And it's like, well, hold on a second.
[2612.92 --> 2616.70]  You know, what if we don't need all that?
[2616.70 --> 2617.46]  What if we just don't?
[2617.68 --> 2617.84]  Yeah.
[2617.84 --> 2618.24]  Yeah.
[2618.24 --> 2618.44]  Yeah.
[2618.60 --> 2620.84]  So this is really cool.
[2620.96 --> 2621.70]  Really exciting.
[2622.26 --> 2626.26]  I am apparently on the list to review at least the Pebble Time.
[2626.50 --> 2628.46]  No idea about the Pebble Time steel.
[2628.62 --> 2633.50]  But I certainly hope they send one of each because I want to make sure that I'm covering these as well as possible.
[2633.50 --> 2639.82]  I'm kind of a Pebble fanboy, although a lot of you have noticed I'm using a G-Watch R now.
[2640.46 --> 2642.18]  It has taken me away from the Pebble.
[2642.26 --> 2648.06]  The Pebble platform has aged and the Pebble steel wasn't enough of a step forward to hold on to me.
[2648.54 --> 2650.72]  But Pebble Time looks...
[2650.72 --> 2652.36]  It might be Pebble Time for me again.
[2653.00 --> 2653.72]  Oh, dang.
[2655.46 --> 2656.54]  Oh, dang.
[2656.76 --> 2662.16]  That is what makes you like the world's best sidekick is no matter how awful I am.
[2662.16 --> 2665.14]  You treat it like I said something cool.
[2666.14 --> 2667.18]  I love you, man.
[2667.30 --> 2668.38]  You did, in my opinion.
[2668.54 --> 2668.84]  Aw.
[2669.42 --> 2670.00]  That's nice.
[2670.32 --> 2671.10]  I love you, man.
[2672.78 --> 2673.86]  What else we got here?
[2674.12 --> 2676.10]  We should have some more good stuff.
[2677.56 --> 2678.52]  All right.
[2679.08 --> 2680.48]  So NVIDIA Titan X.
[2680.64 --> 2682.40]  This was posted by Job03.
[2682.62 --> 2683.82]  Are you posting this in Twitch?
[2684.24 --> 2684.74]  Yep, yep.
[2684.86 --> 2685.52]  I've got everything.
[2685.64 --> 2686.76]  Are you in the habit now?
[2686.90 --> 2688.64]  Do I just not have to remind you anymore?
[2689.30 --> 2689.70]  Nope.
[2689.84 --> 2691.28]  I've got every single link so far.
[2691.28 --> 2694.76]  I even went and found the one for the Pebble watch because that wasn't in order.
[2695.34 --> 2695.74]  Nice.
[2696.50 --> 2696.74]  All right.
[2696.74 --> 2699.06]  The whole Twitch chat is freaking out with hearts.
[2699.92 --> 2700.32]  Aw.
[2700.72 --> 2701.94]  Well, we love you guys, too.
[2702.74 --> 2703.52]  That's cute.
[2703.98 --> 2704.24]  Yay.
[2704.24 --> 2704.34]  All right.
[2704.54 --> 2706.78]  So this is the Titan X.
[2707.16 --> 2708.68]  Basically, it's more black.
[2709.30 --> 2711.98]  It's got, apparently, green LEDs in the fan now.
[2712.52 --> 2714.24]  So NVIDIA is, like...
[2714.24 --> 2716.64]  NVIDIA is shaking things up.
[2716.64 --> 2718.98]  It does look beautiful.
[2720.14 --> 2720.86]  Let's go ahead.
[2720.92 --> 2722.24]  I'm just going to pull up...
[2722.24 --> 2723.96]  Anantek has an article with...
[2723.96 --> 2727.80]  Is that a white LED Titan logo, but green LED fan?
[2728.04 --> 2730.26]  It does look that way, doesn't it?
[2730.58 --> 2732.66]  And I'm a little disappointed in them there.
[2732.68 --> 2733.58]  That's a little weird.
[2733.68 --> 2733.92]  Yeah.
[2733.92 --> 2735.64]  I'm kind of hoping it's RGB.
[2737.32 --> 2738.00]  Right.
[2738.26 --> 2738.90]  That would be very cool.
[2738.92 --> 2744.92]  Even then, that might not make sense because the fan is not so...
[2745.58 --> 2746.92]  So...
[2746.92 --> 2748.26]  Yeah.
[2748.80 --> 2751.60]  At least I thought Anantek had something.
[2752.80 --> 2753.92]  Titan X Specs...
[2754.58 --> 2755.52]  Specul...
[2755.52 --> 2756.92]  Speculation!
[2758.00 --> 2758.60]  Oh!
[2760.24 --> 2760.62]  Snap.
[2761.34 --> 2761.80]  Thank you.
[2761.80 --> 2764.76]  I like how...
[2764.76 --> 2768.12]  I'm just reading the notes on Linus Tech Tips for him right now, actually.
[2768.76 --> 2772.30]  And it says also, it looks like it will have a 12 gigabyte frame buffer.
[2772.74 --> 2775.62]  And without even thinking about it, my brain was like 11.5?
[2777.30 --> 2777.78]  No!
[2778.20 --> 2781.24]  I had people asking me that, like, immediately.
[2781.42 --> 2781.70]  You know what?
[2781.74 --> 2782.56]  I can't...
[2782.56 --> 2783.92]  I can't find...
[2783.92 --> 2785.84]  I could have sworn...
[2785.84 --> 2786.78]  There was...
[2786.78 --> 2787.78]  I could have sworn there...
[2787.78 --> 2789.28]  I thought I saw it on Anantek.
[2789.28 --> 2793.82]  That there was an article where they took what we knew and kind of filled in some of
[2793.82 --> 2795.88]  the we're guessing at blanks.
[2795.88 --> 2796.10]  Okay.
[2796.70 --> 2798.98]  And I'm not seeing that.
[2799.06 --> 2799.60]  I wonder...
[2799.60 --> 2800.30]  I wonder if I'm...
[2800.30 --> 2801.22]  It could be that I'm wrong.
[2801.56 --> 2803.24]  And it could be that...
[2803.24 --> 2804.92]  Yeah.
[2804.98 --> 2805.64]  It could be I'm wrong.
[2805.70 --> 2806.78]  It could be that it was taken down.
[2806.82 --> 2807.20]  I'm not sure.
[2807.32 --> 2808.24]  But basically...
[2808.24 --> 2810.92]  There's an article by Ryan Smith on Anantek.
[2811.04 --> 2813.14]  NVIDIA announces GeForce GTX Titan X.
[2813.56 --> 2815.40]  And it has a spec breakdown.
[2816.40 --> 2817.92]  That is the one I'm looking for.
[2818.02 --> 2819.40]  Why can I not find that?
[2819.50 --> 2820.10]  There we go.
[2820.42 --> 2820.66]  All right.
[2820.68 --> 2821.42]  So let's pull this up.
[2821.52 --> 2825.20]  So the speculation is that it is going to...
[2825.20 --> 2825.30]  No.
[2825.34 --> 2827.02]  We know it has a 12 gig frame buffer.
[2827.70 --> 2828.02]  Okay.
[2828.14 --> 2830.48]  So here you can see what we know and what's a question mark.
[2830.48 --> 2831.34]  Ryan Smith's a good guy.
[2831.40 --> 2832.88]  He doesn't mind me using his chart.
[2832.88 --> 2837.58]  So he's guessing at 384-bit memory interface.
[2837.76 --> 2844.70]  And this is a very good bet based on that medium-sized Maxwell that we already have in the GTX 980 and 970.
[2844.94 --> 2851.82]  It uses a 256-bit interface and then some tomfoolery with the 970 to partially disable...
[2851.82 --> 2852.10]  Whatever.
[2852.24 --> 2855.92]  Anyway, it's a 256-bit interface for most of the memory on the 970 and all of the 980.
[2856.00 --> 2862.54]  So in order to get more memory bandwidth on Titan X, either they're going to clock it higher,
[2862.54 --> 2867.46]  which to my knowledge, there's nothing available with higher than 7 gigahertz GDDR5.
[2867.54 --> 2869.30]  That's basically the ceiling for that technology.
[2869.56 --> 2875.34]  We know that NVIDIA doesn't have any kind of stacked memory technology coming out on Titan X.
[2875.40 --> 2876.94]  That would have been rumored at some point.
[2877.36 --> 2878.06]  Hasn't been.
[2878.32 --> 2880.06]  So we're guessing 384-bit.
[2880.32 --> 2881.92]  We know it has 12 gigs of VRAM.
[2882.02 --> 2886.66]  We know the transistor count is 8 billion, making this big Maxwell.
[2886.86 --> 2889.80]  You know, the supercomputer Tesla Maxwell, but for gamers.
[2889.80 --> 2892.60]  It's getting 96 ROPs.
[2892.74 --> 2894.22]  That's a guess from Ryan Smith.
[2895.62 --> 2900.46]  And should be on the same manufacturing process as GTX 980,
[2900.66 --> 2904.48]  because we haven't heard anything about NVIDIA launching anything higher than that.
[2904.66 --> 2906.00]  And launch price?
[2906.42 --> 2908.36]  I like Ryan's estimate here.
[2909.14 --> 2910.20]  A large number.
[2910.20 --> 2910.92]  Large number.
[2911.50 --> 2911.80]  Yeah.
[2912.02 --> 2912.52]  That's great.
[2912.52 --> 2918.48]  I have heard everything from $1,000 to $1,400 in the rumor mill,
[2918.80 --> 2920.36]  and I have no knowledge whatsoever.
[2920.48 --> 2926.44]  I mean, when Titan launched, $1,000 for a gaming card was insane.
[2927.40 --> 2933.02]  And the answer from NVIDIA was, well, this isn't a gaming card.
[2933.02 --> 2941.24]  This is a CUDA development and dual precision, you know, compute card and rendering workstation-y.
[2941.24 --> 2943.80]  The Titan X is not positioned that way, though.
[2945.68 --> 2947.08]  Look at the photo.
[2948.44 --> 2949.26]  Where's the photo?
[2949.40 --> 2951.14]  The photo shows on the box.
[2951.24 --> 2954.38]  It says, like, designed for gamers or something.
[2954.58 --> 2955.58]  Let me find this photo.
[2956.44 --> 2957.56]  Yeah, I'll try and find the one.
[2957.62 --> 2958.84]  It's on TechGage, I think, right?
[2958.84 --> 2958.88]  Right.
[2960.82 --> 2962.80]  Inspired by gamers built by NVIDIA.
[2963.08 --> 2964.92]  Like, that's gamer marketing.
[2965.24 --> 2965.84]  You can't even...
[2966.62 --> 2967.06]  Remember, too.
[2967.06 --> 2969.24]  Like, before it was a little kind of back and forth.
[2969.54 --> 2970.58]  That's gamer marketing.
[2970.66 --> 2973.88]  No, NVIDIA screwed this up on Titan Z, too, quite frankly.
[2974.22 --> 2975.58]  Because they couldn't decide...
[2975.58 --> 2976.14]  Yeah, there it is.
[2976.28 --> 2977.84]  Inspired by gamers built by NVIDIA.
[2977.96 --> 2979.90]  They couldn't decide on Titan Z.
[2980.04 --> 2981.92]  Because the whole announcement was, like,
[2981.94 --> 2983.60]  the world's most powerful gaming card.
[2984.02 --> 2985.68]  And then when pressed, they're like,
[2985.68 --> 2987.88]  oh, well, it's, you know, for CUDA.
[2988.84 --> 2989.20]  Yeah.
[2989.82 --> 2991.82]  Because it was, like, $3,000 at launch.
[2991.86 --> 2993.02]  It made absolutely no sense.
[2993.08 --> 2996.22]  Like, I do wonder if Titan Z was just NVIDIA
[2996.22 --> 2997.86]  kind of testing the waters.
[2998.26 --> 3001.10]  Like, what are people going to tolerate?
[3001.82 --> 3003.60]  How much will people spend?
[3004.80 --> 3008.36]  I wouldn't be surprised to see Titan X more than $1,000.
[3008.76 --> 3011.86]  But I would be happy to see...
[3011.86 --> 3014.06]  Well, see, happy is such a funny word for this.
[3014.06 --> 3016.06]  I would be...
[3016.06 --> 3020.90]  Some of my faith would be restored if it launched at $1,000 instead of more.
[3021.28 --> 3024.60]  Because looking at what we know about Titan X specs
[3024.60 --> 3031.72]  and what we can estimate based on Titan versus GK-104.
[3032.28 --> 3035.12]  So GK-100 versus GK-104.
[3035.88 --> 3036.02]  Yeah.
[3036.76 --> 3037.32]  Or was it...
[3037.32 --> 3038.64]  GM-100?
[3038.76 --> 3039.32]  I can't remember.
[3039.32 --> 3039.56]  Whatever.
[3039.70 --> 3041.48]  100 versus GK-104 of the last gen.
[3041.78 --> 3047.38]  I would expect it to be about, you know, 40% faster than a GTX 980,
[3047.52 --> 3048.16]  which is...
[3048.16 --> 3051.52]  Now we're talking GM-204 versus GM-200.
[3052.14 --> 3054.66]  So if it costs 40% more, then that would be like,
[3054.72 --> 3056.70]  okay, we're not going to pay a huge premium for this.
[3056.78 --> 3058.52]  But if you're getting double precision,
[3058.68 --> 3059.26]  NVIDIA could go,
[3059.36 --> 3060.98]  well, hey, that's worth a couple hundred bucks.
[3060.98 --> 3062.72]  And, you know, hey, it's blacker.
[3063.26 --> 3065.54]  That's worth a bit anyway, at least you think.
[3065.54 --> 3068.04]  So we'll see what they do.
[3068.34 --> 3069.76]  Like I said earlier on the stream,
[3069.82 --> 3070.60]  for those of you who missed it,
[3070.64 --> 3072.24]  apparently our card is inbound,
[3072.40 --> 3074.40]  so Luke has his work cut out for him when he gets back.
[3074.82 --> 3077.70]  And I'm going to have to completely rearrange our video schedule
[3077.70 --> 3079.86]  that I spent, like, two hours on this week
[3079.86 --> 3082.54]  because we're trying to make room for buffering some content.
[3083.42 --> 3084.80]  So, yeah.
[3085.28 --> 3087.78]  We can just release, like, 16 videos about Titan X.
[3089.00 --> 3089.70]  Remember about it.
[3090.06 --> 3091.36]  Titan X, Shroud.
[3091.82 --> 3093.32]  Titan X, Heat Pipes.
[3093.32 --> 3094.48]  Top five.
[3094.80 --> 3097.52]  Top five screws that hold together Titan X.
[3098.68 --> 3100.82]  Not all of the screws, just the top five.
[3101.16 --> 3104.00]  Top five games that push the Titan X's frame buffer
[3104.00 --> 3105.02]  more than other ones.
[3105.32 --> 3106.30]  Oh, my goodness.
[3106.44 --> 3106.86]  You know what?
[3106.92 --> 3109.08]  You are starting to sound like a YouTuber.
[3110.30 --> 3111.92]  It only took a few years,
[3112.34 --> 3114.58]  but you're starting to sound like a YouTuber, damn it.
[3116.38 --> 3117.76]  I'm kind of sad, though.
[3117.84 --> 3118.96]  I'm still going to do it
[3118.96 --> 3120.58]  because it's a really cool-looking card.
[3120.58 --> 3122.88]  But I went by EVGA,
[3123.04 --> 3124.68]  and they have their 980 Kingpin.
[3125.80 --> 3126.72]  And I was like, oh, cool,
[3126.82 --> 3128.10]  because I haven't actually seen that one yet.
[3128.14 --> 3128.82]  And I was going to do, like,
[3128.84 --> 3130.06]  a little mini video on it tomorrow.
[3130.16 --> 3131.04]  And I'm still going to do it,
[3131.14 --> 3134.90]  but that video is so hampered by the Titan X news.
[3136.74 --> 3137.46]  Yeah, man.
[3137.58 --> 3138.44]  Oh, jeez.
[3138.62 --> 3139.04]  Oh, well.
[3139.18 --> 3140.86]  But the suggestion...
[3140.86 --> 3142.36]  I'll call it the Titan X prequel.
[3142.36 --> 3144.62]  Because I can assure you
[3144.62 --> 3146.64]  that EVGA, at some level,
[3146.76 --> 3149.08]  is privy to what NVIDIA's got going on.
[3149.38 --> 3151.08]  So if they thought it was worth it
[3151.08 --> 3152.44]  to release a 980 Kingpin,
[3152.64 --> 3154.24]  then this is the first hint
[3154.24 --> 3155.72]  that Titan X is going to be
[3155.72 --> 3157.68]  a heck of a lot more expensive than 980.
[3158.94 --> 3159.20]  Yeah.
[3159.34 --> 3160.10]  Because a Kingpin...
[3160.10 --> 3160.34]  Yeah.
[3160.70 --> 3161.76]  I might have said classified.
[3161.88 --> 3162.50]  I meant Kingpin.
[3162.58 --> 3163.88]  We have a 980 classified.
[3164.44 --> 3164.88]  Are you drunk?
[3164.88 --> 3166.24]  Yeah, I meant Kingpin.
[3166.46 --> 3167.28]  Oh, you meant Kingpin.
[3167.34 --> 3168.12]  No, you said Kingpin.
[3168.20 --> 3168.44]  I meant Kingpin.
[3168.60 --> 3168.72]  Yeah.
[3168.82 --> 3169.30]  Okay, good.
[3169.36 --> 3169.50]  Yeah.
[3169.50 --> 3170.42]  No, you got it right.
[3170.94 --> 3173.30]  Everything was 100% okay until just now.
[3173.48 --> 3173.56]  Okay.
[3175.18 --> 3175.58]  Dang.
[3176.30 --> 3178.34]  Because a Kingpin typically carries,
[3178.48 --> 3179.84]  what, a $50, $100 premium
[3179.84 --> 3180.64]  over a classified?
[3183.80 --> 3184.50]  It's a lot.
[3184.60 --> 3186.22]  The 980 Kingpin is $800.
[3187.12 --> 3187.48]  Yeah.
[3187.74 --> 3189.74]  So if this is only $200 more,
[3190.04 --> 3191.12]  I'm willing to bet
[3191.12 --> 3192.48]  this isn't only $200 more.
[3193.64 --> 3194.08]  Right.
[3194.38 --> 3195.04]  So we'll see.
[3195.84 --> 3197.18]  We shall see.
[3197.18 --> 3198.96]  I like that for sure.
[3199.08 --> 3201.46]  Let's get into a little bit more NVIDIA news.
[3201.82 --> 3204.30]  So just because you've been like on flights
[3204.30 --> 3205.80]  and packing and all that stuff,
[3205.94 --> 3207.72]  you missed out big.
[3208.38 --> 3209.00]  So NVIDIA...
[3209.00 --> 3210.04]  That's pretty important.
[3210.64 --> 3210.90]  Yeah.
[3211.00 --> 3213.80]  NVIDIA announced the NVIDIA Shield again.
[3214.50 --> 3215.34]  Remember, guys,
[3215.40 --> 3216.62]  for those of you who don't remember this,
[3216.68 --> 3218.08]  the original Shield handheld
[3218.08 --> 3219.20]  was called the Shield.
[3219.78 --> 3221.90]  And then they renamed it Shield Portable
[3221.90 --> 3223.52]  when they launched the Shield tablet.
[3223.52 --> 3225.96]  And now we're getting the NVIDIA Shield,
[3226.68 --> 3228.16]  which is a console.
[3228.30 --> 3229.58]  It does not have a display.
[3230.10 --> 3231.42]  I believe it comes...
[3231.42 --> 3231.54]  Yeah.
[3231.62 --> 3233.12]  So it's priced at $199
[3233.12 --> 3234.54]  with a game controller
[3234.54 --> 3236.56]  and 50 games,
[3236.64 --> 3237.74]  including Crisis 3
[3237.74 --> 3239.52]  and Borderlands the pre-sequel.
[3239.58 --> 3241.68]  I'm assuming that's the grid subscription
[3241.68 --> 3242.68]  that you get with it.
[3242.72 --> 3244.14]  And I'm not sure how long
[3244.14 --> 3245.84]  you get a grid subscription with it
[3245.84 --> 3247.56]  because I know that they were talking about
[3247.56 --> 3248.28]  at some point
[3248.28 --> 3250.36]  Shield Portable and Shield Tablet
[3250.36 --> 3252.66]  getting six months or something like that.
[3253.06 --> 3254.04]  Three months, maybe.
[3254.32 --> 3254.70]  Whatever.
[3254.84 --> 3255.76]  They were getting like a window.
[3256.24 --> 3256.94]  This one, I don't know.
[3257.00 --> 3258.82]  Maybe it just comes with a grid subscription.
[3259.00 --> 3259.20]  Anyway.
[3259.68 --> 3260.26]  So they launched...
[3260.26 --> 3260.38]  Just a heads up,
[3260.46 --> 3262.42]  this was posted by GivingTNT on the forum.
[3262.52 --> 3263.12]  Ah, thank you.
[3263.52 --> 3266.80]  So Shield is going to have
[3266.80 --> 3269.70]  a Tegra X1 processor.
[3270.26 --> 3271.40]  So NVIDIA is claiming
[3271.40 --> 3274.26]  twice the power of an Xbox 360
[3274.26 --> 3276.34]  at one-fifth of the power consumption.
[3276.68 --> 3277.66]  It is going to be capable
[3277.66 --> 3279.92]  of decoding 4K at 60 FPS.
[3280.36 --> 3283.38]  It is going to be the first 4K Android TV.
[3284.12 --> 3285.30]  And it's really funny.
[3285.38 --> 3286.04]  Someone put together
[3286.04 --> 3287.94]  a hilarious cut-up
[3287.94 --> 3289.76]  of Jensen saying,
[3289.96 --> 3292.90]  TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.
[3293.02 --> 3294.54]  Like, it seemed like...
[3294.54 --> 3295.50]  When you watch it like that,
[3295.56 --> 3296.56]  it seems like every word
[3296.56 --> 3297.52]  out of his freaking mouth
[3297.52 --> 3298.08]  during this thing
[3298.08 --> 3299.00]  must have been TV.
[3299.46 --> 3302.16]  TV, TV, television, TV, television.
[3302.58 --> 3303.76]  Android TV, TV.
[3304.20 --> 3306.12]  Like, so they're really pitching it
[3306.12 --> 3308.36]  as like an Android TV device
[3308.36 --> 3310.58]  that's capable of 4K.
[3310.70 --> 3312.04]  But it's also...
[3312.04 --> 3315.56]  It's also very much a console.
[3315.88 --> 3318.32]  So Razer was showing off
[3318.32 --> 3319.12]  in their suite.
[3319.22 --> 3320.30]  And I really do think
[3320.30 --> 3321.56]  Razer's console is
[3321.56 --> 3323.66]  completely dead in the water
[3323.66 --> 3324.30]  at this point.
[3324.78 --> 3325.80]  If it's an extra...
[3325.80 --> 3327.44]  If it's an extra hundred bucks
[3327.44 --> 3329.48]  for this thing,
[3329.54 --> 3330.98]  which is not running
[3330.98 --> 3332.04]  a Snapdragon, Ada,
[3332.22 --> 3333.04]  whatever the heck,
[3333.04 --> 3335.26]  and is going to be able
[3335.26 --> 3336.30]  to legitimately run
[3336.30 --> 3337.76]  some serious games
[3337.76 --> 3338.70]  at 1080p
[3338.70 --> 3340.18]  and some not serious games
[3340.18 --> 3340.76]  that who knows,
[3340.82 --> 3341.66]  maybe you can run games
[3341.66 --> 3342.54]  at 4K as well.
[3342.66 --> 3343.62]  Because it does have
[3343.62 --> 3345.26]  HDMI 2.0 out.
[3345.46 --> 3346.54]  So you can legit
[3346.54 --> 3348.04]  hook this up to your 4K TV
[3348.04 --> 3350.22]  and have that 4K experience.
[3350.92 --> 3351.72]  And so anyway,
[3351.82 --> 3353.02]  so it's got the GPU horsepower.
[3353.34 --> 3353.92]  And sorry, right,
[3353.96 --> 3354.76]  back to the Razer booth.
[3355.06 --> 3355.90]  So they showed off
[3355.90 --> 3356.64]  a really cool
[3356.64 --> 3358.24]  arena fighter-based game
[3358.24 --> 3360.42]  that was for concurrent players.
[3360.42 --> 3362.34]  Um, this is what
[3362.34 --> 3363.58]  Android consoles
[3363.58 --> 3364.76]  have been building to.
[3365.28 --> 3366.20]  Android consoles,
[3366.42 --> 3367.96]  if they get game support
[3367.96 --> 3369.74]  for actual legitimate
[3369.74 --> 3370.46]  multiplayer games,
[3370.50 --> 3371.48]  up till now there hasn't
[3371.48 --> 3372.66]  been a whole lot of,
[3372.74 --> 3373.78]  like, sit around
[3373.78 --> 3374.62]  with your bros
[3374.62 --> 3376.14]  and play games on controllers,
[3376.64 --> 3377.44]  Android games.
[3377.80 --> 3379.94]  If NVIDIA is pushing this,
[3380.18 --> 3380.76]  and boy,
[3380.86 --> 3381.84]  have they ever demonstrated
[3381.84 --> 3382.80]  that they're pushing this
[3382.80 --> 3383.64]  ever since they announced
[3383.64 --> 3384.40]  console mode
[3384.40 --> 3385.42]  for the original Shield,
[3385.86 --> 3387.18]  and then it was like
[3387.18 --> 3388.28]  this stupid
[3388.28 --> 3389.78]  kind of experience
[3389.78 --> 3390.72]  where you have to get,
[3390.88 --> 3392.84]  like, an on-the-go adapter
[3392.84 --> 3393.62]  and, like,
[3393.64 --> 3395.62]  a USB Ethernet thing,
[3395.68 --> 3396.34]  and then you could run
[3396.34 --> 3398.88]  1080p 60 instead of 720p,
[3399.30 --> 3399.92]  and, like,
[3400.32 --> 3401.96]  you had to, you know,
[3402.08 --> 3402.68]  charge it up
[3402.68 --> 3403.58]  before you did it,
[3403.62 --> 3404.02]  and then,
[3404.24 --> 3404.98]  okay, well, hold on,
[3405.02 --> 3405.94]  maybe if you use a splitter.
[3406.10 --> 3406.82]  So I use a splitter
[3406.82 --> 3407.44]  and a powered hub
[3407.44 --> 3408.44]  in order to charge the Shield
[3408.44 --> 3409.52]  and run it at the same time,
[3409.56 --> 3410.38]  but, and then,
[3410.52 --> 3411.60]  and then it's like,
[3411.82 --> 3412.54]  okay, so yeah,
[3412.54 --> 3413.28]  that's, like,
[3413.28 --> 3414.00]  pretty doofus-y.
[3414.18 --> 3415.50]  Then we got Shield Tablet,
[3415.62 --> 3417.04]  where they were really pitching
[3417.04 --> 3418.18]  using it as a console,
[3418.18 --> 3419.44]  and, hey,
[3419.52 --> 3420.32]  now we've got support
[3420.32 --> 3421.72]  for multiple wireless controllers,
[3421.90 --> 3422.80]  we've got our own controller,
[3422.92 --> 3423.94]  there's all this awesome stuff,
[3424.02 --> 3424.54]  NVIDIA didn't have
[3424.54 --> 3425.40]  their own controller before.
[3425.74 --> 3426.62]  They are pushing hard,
[3426.70 --> 3428.20]  so now there's a dedicated console,
[3428.62 --> 3429.66]  it's 40 plus hours
[3429.66 --> 3430.20]  of battery life
[3430.20 --> 3430.84]  on the controller,
[3430.96 --> 3431.82]  it comes with a remote
[3431.82 --> 3433.40]  that includes voice activation,
[3433.58 --> 3434.38]  so you can use
[3434.38 --> 3435.48]  all your Google Now nonsense
[3435.48 --> 3436.12]  with it.
[3437.12 --> 3437.44]  Um,
[3437.94 --> 3438.98]  and Grid,
[3439.22 --> 3440.08]  Grid's a big deal.
[3440.44 --> 3440.72]  Um,
[3440.72 --> 3441.48]  NVIDIA's claiming
[3441.48 --> 3443.22]  150 milliseconds of latency
[3443.22 --> 3444.38]  playing games remotely,
[3444.60 --> 3445.02]  which, again,
[3445.02 --> 3446.46]  no CSGO,
[3446.86 --> 3447.36]  forget it,
[3447.60 --> 3448.34]  not gonna happen,
[3448.90 --> 3450.32]  but for racing games,
[3450.52 --> 3451.54]  for third person,
[3452.06 --> 3452.28]  you know,
[3452.34 --> 3453.28]  adventure games,
[3453.52 --> 3455.02]  that's gonna be very playable,
[3455.20 --> 3455.84]  and I know this
[3455.84 --> 3456.56]  because I've been
[3456.56 --> 3457.40]  in the Grid beta
[3457.40 --> 3458.62]  for over a year now,
[3458.94 --> 3460.88]  it is surprisingly not bad.
[3461.62 --> 3463.14]  Very surprisingly not bad,
[3463.18 --> 3464.44]  and I'm not as close
[3464.44 --> 3465.56]  to an NVIDIA data center
[3465.56 --> 3466.82]  as some people would be.
[3467.08 --> 3467.56]  Right, yeah.
[3467.56 --> 3468.76]  Once they start putting
[3468.76 --> 3469.42]  Grid centers
[3469.42 --> 3470.94]  around the planet,
[3471.56 --> 3472.90]  we are gonna be talking about,
[3472.90 --> 3474.42]  especially in places,
[3474.66 --> 3475.56]  like in small,
[3475.90 --> 3476.86]  dense places,
[3477.10 --> 3477.78]  like, I don't know,
[3477.84 --> 3479.14]  the UK or Japan,
[3480.10 --> 3481.08]  you could be
[3481.08 --> 3482.70]  within a distance
[3482.70 --> 3483.80]  that would give you,
[3483.84 --> 3484.12]  you know,
[3484.28 --> 3485.20]  fiber latencies
[3485.20 --> 3485.94]  in the, you know,
[3486.12 --> 3487.16]  five millisecond
[3487.16 --> 3488.22]  or lower range
[3488.22 --> 3490.04]  of a grid center
[3490.04 --> 3491.22]  if it comes to that,
[3491.56 --> 3492.98]  and it may actually,
[3493.26 --> 3494.22]  for many gamers,
[3494.34 --> 3495.58]  especially casual ones,
[3495.58 --> 3496.92]  who might not play
[3496.92 --> 3497.86]  a particular game,
[3497.94 --> 3498.02]  like,
[3498.06 --> 3499.04]  that's something to consider
[3499.04 --> 3500.06]  for the gamers
[3500.06 --> 3500.64]  that are saying,
[3500.82 --> 3501.00]  you know,
[3501.06 --> 3501.98]  online streaming gaming
[3501.98 --> 3502.88]  is never gonna happen.
[3503.30 --> 3504.88]  Not everyone buys a game
[3504.88 --> 3505.70]  for 60 bucks
[3505.70 --> 3507.22]  and then puts 150 hours
[3507.22 --> 3507.70]  into it.
[3508.10 --> 3508.28]  Yeah.
[3508.52 --> 3510.20]  Some people are more like
[3510.20 --> 3512.32]  a casual browser,
[3512.94 --> 3514.18]  and they don't wanna buy
[3514.18 --> 3514.84]  every game,
[3515.02 --> 3515.90]  but if they have,
[3516.00 --> 3516.52]  you know,
[3516.58 --> 3517.24]  50 games,
[3517.30 --> 3517.64]  or 100,
[3517.74 --> 3518.26]  or 150,
[3518.44 --> 3519.20]  or 500 games
[3519.20 --> 3519.78]  at their fingertips,
[3520.06 --> 3520.94]  they might play this one
[3520.94 --> 3521.54]  for an hour,
[3521.70 --> 3522.42]  or they might play that one
[3522.42 --> 3523.38]  for a couple hours,
[3523.58 --> 3524.82]  and this is going to
[3524.82 --> 3525.66]  really appeal
[3525.66 --> 3526.34]  to those people.
[3526.98 --> 3527.16]  Yeah.
[3528.30 --> 3529.52]  They should just start
[3529.52 --> 3530.08]  installing them
[3530.08 --> 3530.64]  on all the Tesla
[3530.64 --> 3531.46]  charging stations.
[3531.46 --> 3533.16]  Ha!
[3533.52 --> 3534.18]  That'd actually be
[3534.18 --> 3534.66]  kinda awesome.
[3535.26 --> 3535.72]  Sitting, like,
[3535.72 --> 3536.22]  play games.
[3536.22 --> 3536.24]  It'd be, like,
[3536.24 --> 3536.46]  everywhere.
[3537.10 --> 3537.30]  Yeah.
[3538.58 --> 3539.38]  That'd be great.
[3539.50 --> 3539.94]  Apparently,
[3540.14 --> 3540.70]  the grid service
[3540.70 --> 3541.46]  is gonna come with
[3541.46 --> 3542.58]  unreleased games
[3542.58 --> 3543.80]  that will be on
[3543.80 --> 3544.66]  Shield at launch.
[3545.00 --> 3545.30]  Remember,
[3545.46 --> 3546.36]  NVIDIA's got those
[3546.36 --> 3547.24]  deep developer
[3547.24 --> 3547.92]  relationships.
[3548.26 --> 3548.90]  Yeah, they do.
[3549.20 --> 3550.06]  Imagine that.
[3550.14 --> 3551.26]  And what's also
[3551.26 --> 3552.92]  really cool about grid,
[3553.24 --> 3553.96]  and, again,
[3554.08 --> 3555.20]  why I want home grid,
[3555.74 --> 3556.66]  this is still not
[3556.66 --> 3557.80]  the grid I'm looking for.
[3558.48 --> 3559.54]  I want home grid,
[3559.76 --> 3560.66]  where you just, like,
[3560.86 --> 3563.38]  pile in a pile of GPUs,
[3563.54 --> 3564.16]  and then you have
[3564.16 --> 3565.10]  basically unlimited
[3565.10 --> 3565.98]  horsepower that you
[3565.98 --> 3566.54]  can divvy up
[3566.54 --> 3567.38]  however you want.
[3568.90 --> 3569.24]  I mean,
[3569.36 --> 3570.36]  we could potentially
[3570.36 --> 3571.04]  be looking at,
[3571.08 --> 3571.22]  you know,
[3571.26 --> 3572.12]  every game on Macs
[3572.12 --> 3572.68]  no matter what,
[3572.94 --> 3573.62]  because they can throw
[3573.62 --> 3574.72]  as much GPU horsepower
[3574.72 --> 3576.04]  at it as they want.
[3576.44 --> 3576.72]  And, yeah,
[3576.80 --> 3578.24]  it'll be 1080p.
[3579.24 --> 3579.76]  1080p60,
[3580.02 --> 3580.42]  I believe,
[3580.56 --> 3581.66]  is the premium service,
[3581.72 --> 3582.52]  with the normal service
[3582.52 --> 3583.80]  being 720p30.
[3583.80 --> 3585.40]  so for people
[3585.40 --> 3586.26]  with smaller TVs,
[3586.40 --> 3586.80]  effectively.
[3588.88 --> 3589.92]  Max details, though.
[3590.14 --> 3590.98]  It's gonna be nice.
[3591.68 --> 3592.22]  That's awesome.
[3592.94 --> 3593.32]  You know what?
[3593.34 --> 3594.02]  Maybe we should do,
[3594.12 --> 3594.26]  like,
[3594.40 --> 3594.96]  maybe we should probably
[3594.96 --> 3596.16]  do a straw poll on this.
[3597.22 --> 3598.10]  Straw poll.
[3599.58 --> 3600.84]  And I want your guys
[3600.84 --> 3601.66]  honest answer.
[3601.76 --> 3602.52]  I know a lot of the time
[3602.52 --> 3603.20]  we do, like,
[3603.28 --> 3604.46]  just troll straw polls,
[3604.56 --> 3605.52]  or we'll have, like,
[3605.54 --> 3606.94]  a troll answer.
[3607.52 --> 3607.82]  Yeah.
[3609.46 --> 3609.98]  Dang it,
[3610.00 --> 3610.90]  I typed in the wrong thing.
[3611.04 --> 3611.70]  No, yes,
[3611.74 --> 3612.54]  I want to leave this page.
[3613.80 --> 3614.12]  Okay,
[3614.64 --> 3616.36]  will you subscribe,
[3616.76 --> 3616.98]  okay,
[3617.34 --> 3618.32]  what price
[3618.32 --> 3620.22]  to subscribe
[3620.22 --> 3620.96]  to
[3620.96 --> 3621.76]  Grid
[3621.76 --> 3622.72]  Premium?
[3623.12 --> 3624.18]  That's what I want to know.
[3624.30 --> 3624.46]  So,
[3624.64 --> 3625.84]  just for context,
[3626.00 --> 3626.26]  guys,
[3626.44 --> 3627.54]  Netflix is gonna be,
[3627.66 --> 3627.72]  what,
[3627.78 --> 3628.70]  eight bucks a month?
[3630.68 --> 3631.16]  Amazon,
[3631.36 --> 3632.22]  do they still include
[3632.22 --> 3633.74]  their Prime video service
[3633.74 --> 3634.68]  with a Prime membership?
[3635.86 --> 3637.12]  I can't remember
[3637.12 --> 3637.60]  the details.
[3637.62 --> 3637.88]  I think so.
[3638.24 --> 3638.70]  I don't know,
[3638.76 --> 3639.62]  because that's not available
[3639.62 --> 3640.18]  in Canada.
[3640.32 --> 3640.60]  Yeah.
[3641.00 --> 3642.82]  But I think they do.
[3643.04 --> 3643.32]  Okay.
[3643.32 --> 3643.88]  So,
[3643.96 --> 3644.82]  Netflix is gonna be
[3644.82 --> 3645.82]  eight bucks a month
[3645.82 --> 3646.20]  or whatever.
[3647.60 --> 3648.14]  Let's see,
[3648.24 --> 3648.86]  what else is,
[3649.00 --> 3649.12]  like,
[3649.16 --> 3649.72]  what else could we
[3649.72 --> 3650.82]  really compare it to?
[3651.00 --> 3652.16]  Hulu is in that same
[3652.16 --> 3652.88]  kind of price range,
[3652.92 --> 3653.48]  or Hulu Plus,
[3653.56 --> 3653.76]  rather,
[3653.86 --> 3654.48]  is in that same price range.
[3654.98 --> 3655.58]  Crunchyroll
[3655.58 --> 3656.96]  is in the neighborhood
[3656.96 --> 3658.36]  of about eight bucks a month
[3658.36 --> 3659.12]  or ten bucks a month
[3659.12 --> 3659.92]  or something like that.
[3660.66 --> 3661.40]  Vessel will be much
[3661.40 --> 3662.06]  cheaper than that.
[3662.18 --> 3662.30]  Yeah,
[3662.30 --> 3662.98]  Vessel's three.
[3663.76 --> 3665.14]  But Vessel doesn't have
[3665.14 --> 3665.98]  any exclusive content.
[3666.60 --> 3667.58]  It's just early access.
[3667.58 --> 3668.16]  So,
[3668.26 --> 3668.84]  whatever.
[3670.08 --> 3671.18]  I'm talking about
[3671.18 --> 3672.26]  exclusive content
[3672.26 --> 3672.90]  where you're actually
[3672.90 --> 3673.98]  buying content
[3673.98 --> 3674.88]  for your subscription.
[3677.00 --> 3677.56]  So,
[3677.76 --> 3678.02]  okay.
[3678.42 --> 3678.68]  Netflix,
[3678.84 --> 3679.04]  Hulu,
[3679.34 --> 3679.60]  mainly.
[3679.80 --> 3680.40]  HBO Go.
[3681.02 --> 3681.22]  Oh,
[3681.28 --> 3681.44]  yeah,
[3681.54 --> 3681.90]  that's,
[3682.00 --> 3682.46]  that's,
[3682.54 --> 3682.82]  uh,
[3683.00 --> 3683.80]  what's the new,
[3683.86 --> 3684.72]  what's the new thing?
[3685.32 --> 3686.60]  HBO Now,
[3686.90 --> 3687.50]  which is gonna be
[3687.50 --> 3688.44]  different from HBO Go,
[3688.54 --> 3688.98]  is apparently,
[3689.22 --> 3689.42]  uh,
[3689.42 --> 3690.36]  could be launching in April
[3690.36 --> 3692.10]  for $15 a month.
[3692.70 --> 3694.02]  That's not that cheap.
[3694.14 --> 3694.50]  That's,
[3694.62 --> 3694.86]  yeah.
[3695.00 --> 3695.36]  So,
[3695.92 --> 3696.58]  um,
[3697.12 --> 3698.50]  it's not clear
[3698.50 --> 3699.70]  what content will be included.
[3699.78 --> 3699.96]  Sorry,
[3700.04 --> 3701.04]  we're switching news topics.
[3701.22 --> 3701.38]  Okay,
[3701.40 --> 3701.62]  whatever.
[3701.70 --> 3702.54]  Let's do the HBO thing
[3702.54 --> 3703.72]  because it kind of ties into this.
[3704.16 --> 3704.38]  Okay.
[3704.38 --> 3705.40]  It's not clear what content
[3705.40 --> 3705.96]  will be included,
[3706.08 --> 3706.94]  but in my mind,
[3707.20 --> 3708.36]  I really do wonder
[3708.36 --> 3709.42]  if it's gonna be everything.
[3710.22 --> 3711.98]  At $15 a month.
[3712.30 --> 3712.46]  Yeah.
[3712.46 --> 3713.36]  We're talking like,
[3713.44 --> 3714.48]  you're paying a dollar
[3714.48 --> 3715.72]  per thing you're gonna watch
[3715.72 --> 3716.56]  if you're watching
[3716.56 --> 3717.46]  just new stuff
[3717.46 --> 3718.22]  and you don't follow
[3718.22 --> 3719.30]  every HBO show.
[3719.56 --> 3719.64]  Like,
[3720.42 --> 3720.68]  Yeah.
[3720.82 --> 3721.84]  That is some pretty
[3721.84 --> 3723.06]  premium pricing
[3723.06 --> 3724.16]  they got going on there.
[3724.78 --> 3725.64]  That is really expensive.
[3726.04 --> 3726.52]  But,
[3727.06 --> 3727.48]  it's,
[3727.62 --> 3728.02]  it's,
[3728.04 --> 3728.38]  it's,
[3728.38 --> 3728.82]  uh,
[3728.98 --> 3730.18]  blah, blah, blah.
[3730.38 --> 3730.52]  Yeah.
[3730.60 --> 3730.76]  So,
[3730.82 --> 3731.76]  the article from Engadget,
[3731.80 --> 3732.46]  this was posted by
[3732.46 --> 3734.02]  Rohith Kumar SP.
[3734.60 --> 3735.00]  Um,
[3735.26 --> 3735.54]  so,
[3735.74 --> 3736.60]  the article from Engadget
[3736.60 --> 3737.80]  speculates that
[3737.80 --> 3739.28]  it might only have
[3739.28 --> 3739.96]  older content
[3739.96 --> 3741.26]  because HBO
[3741.26 --> 3742.60]  probably doesn't want
[3742.60 --> 3743.64]  their entire viewer base
[3743.64 --> 3744.72]  to cut the cable
[3744.72 --> 3745.78]  because I suspect
[3745.78 --> 3746.78]  HBO subscriptions
[3746.78 --> 3748.26]  are the only thing
[3748.26 --> 3749.48]  keeping a lot of people
[3749.48 --> 3750.20]  from cord cutting.
[3750.88 --> 3751.08]  Yeah.
[3751.54 --> 3751.74]  So,
[3751.92 --> 3753.26]  $15 a month for that.
[3753.38 --> 3753.54]  So,
[3753.60 --> 3754.14]  let's go ahead,
[3754.24 --> 3754.42]  let's,
[3754.48 --> 3754.72]  let's,
[3754.80 --> 3755.60]  let's do like a few
[3755.60 --> 3756.56]  different price points here.
[3756.62 --> 3757.74]  Let's go less than
[3757.74 --> 3758.20]  $5.
[3759.16 --> 3759.60]  Okay,
[3759.72 --> 3760.50]  let's go,
[3760.66 --> 3760.96]  um,
[3760.96 --> 3761.38]  We're talking about
[3761.38 --> 3762.10]  grid right now,
[3762.16 --> 3762.26]  right?
[3762.26 --> 3762.44]  Yeah,
[3762.58 --> 3762.80]  yeah,
[3762.96 --> 3763.46]  5 to,
[3763.58 --> 3764.34]  5 to 10.
[3764.34 --> 3765.46]  Uh,
[3765.52 --> 3767.00]  let's go 10 to,
[3767.00 --> 3767.62]  uh,
[3767.62 --> 3768.24]  15.
[3769.22 --> 3769.96]  Let's go,
[3770.10 --> 3770.32]  let's,
[3770.42 --> 3770.90]  let's see.
[3771.16 --> 3772.12]  Would people pay
[3772.12 --> 3773.94]  like 15 to $25
[3773.94 --> 3774.84]  for,
[3775.24 --> 3776.20]  so all you can eat
[3776.20 --> 3777.14]  game service,
[3777.56 --> 3778.02]  um,
[3778.18 --> 3779.22]  at the cost
[3779.22 --> 3780.08]  of needing to deal
[3780.08 --> 3781.02]  with 150 milliseconds
[3781.02 --> 3781.64]  of latency?
[3781.86 --> 3782.50]  Because remember,
[3782.60 --> 3784.12]  you can go buy CSGO
[3784.12 --> 3785.08]  and install that
[3785.08 --> 3785.62]  on your computer
[3785.62 --> 3786.56]  and then you can
[3786.56 --> 3787.42]  play everything else
[3787.42 --> 3788.08]  on grid if you don't
[3788.08 --> 3788.28]  care.
[3788.76 --> 3789.02]  Um,
[3789.02 --> 3789.88]  and then let's go,
[3790.10 --> 3790.52]  um,
[3790.52 --> 3792.08]  I,
[3792.20 --> 3793.30]  I'm not even going
[3793.30 --> 3793.84]  to have an option
[3793.84 --> 3795.02]  over 50 because I
[3795.02 --> 3795.52]  don't think they're
[3795.52 --> 3795.82]  going to charge
[3795.82 --> 3796.74]  anywhere near that
[3796.74 --> 3797.06]  much.
[3797.68 --> 3798.08]  Um,
[3798.28 --> 3798.80]  and I'm just going
[3798.80 --> 3799.28]  to have an option
[3799.28 --> 3800.24]  that says no way.
[3800.88 --> 3801.72]  People are calling
[3801.72 --> 3802.44]  me out for being
[3802.44 --> 3802.88]  tired.
[3803.08 --> 3803.50]  I,
[3803.58 --> 3803.76]  I,
[3803.76 --> 3805.06]  I have to be the,
[3805.10 --> 3806.14]  the only like desk
[3806.14 --> 3807.26]  chair thing in here
[3807.26 --> 3807.92]  is being currently
[3807.92 --> 3808.84]  taken up by Brandon
[3808.84 --> 3809.58]  because he needs to
[3809.58 --> 3809.82]  edit.
[3809.94 --> 3811.08]  So I'm like laying
[3811.08 --> 3811.64]  in bed.
[3811.64 --> 3812.86]  I had two hours of
[3812.86 --> 3813.68]  sleep last night and
[3813.68 --> 3814.30]  I was walking around
[3814.30 --> 3815.40]  the conference all day
[3815.40 --> 3815.74]  today.
[3816.12 --> 3816.90]  So yes,
[3816.90 --> 3818.36]  I am extremely tired.
[3818.48 --> 3819.16]  I'm sorry for the
[3819.16 --> 3819.40]  yawning.
[3819.68 --> 3820.30]  Cause I was,
[3820.30 --> 3821.34]  I was talking to
[3821.34 --> 3823.68]  you at like whatever
[3823.68 --> 3824.62]  time that was.
[3824.62 --> 3825.46]  That was like midnight
[3825.46 --> 3826.24]  after midnight,
[3826.34 --> 3826.74]  my time.
[3827.16 --> 3827.44]  Yeah.
[3827.64 --> 3827.80]  Yeah.
[3827.80 --> 3828.44]  It was like one,
[3828.56 --> 3829.82]  my time was like five.
[3829.90 --> 3830.76]  I think I finally went
[3830.76 --> 3831.94]  to bed at like 5am
[3831.94 --> 3834.38]  local time and then I
[3834.38 --> 3835.30]  had to wake up at like
[3835.30 --> 3835.76]  seven.
[3838.06 --> 3838.54]  Either,
[3838.74 --> 3839.16]  either,
[3839.16 --> 3841.56]  either your boss is
[3841.56 --> 3842.94]  like a terrible person
[3842.94 --> 3844.02]  or you're extremely
[3844.02 --> 3844.62]  dedicated.
[3847.14 --> 3847.78]  All right.
[3847.82 --> 3848.38]  Now I,
[3848.76 --> 3849.06]  I,
[3849.14 --> 3849.40]  I,
[3849.40 --> 3849.62]  I,
[3849.62 --> 3849.68]  I,
[3849.86 --> 3850.20]  can you,
[3850.36 --> 3851.26]  can you see the,
[3851.32 --> 3851.48]  uh,
[3851.48 --> 3852.12]  can you see the stream
[3852.12 --> 3852.42]  right now?
[3852.48 --> 3852.58]  I'm,
[3852.58 --> 3853.94]  I want to talk about,
[3853.94 --> 3855.42]  I want to talk about this
[3855.42 --> 3856.94]  grid premium thing as the
[3856.94 --> 3857.84]  results roll in.
[3857.98 --> 3860.92]  So it looks like they're
[3860.92 --> 3861.78]  going to have a lot of
[3861.78 --> 3862.22]  customers.
[3862.44 --> 3863.72]  This is something I wasn't
[3863.72 --> 3864.18]  expecting.
[3864.34 --> 3865.28]  Our audience,
[3865.44 --> 3866.66]  I was expecting to go
[3866.66 --> 3867.18]  hardcore,
[3867.34 --> 3867.82]  no way,
[3868.00 --> 3870.12]  or like less than five
[3870.12 --> 3870.52]  bucks.
[3871.06 --> 3872.74]  But you guys are giving us
[3872.74 --> 3873.72]  some real interesting
[3873.72 --> 3874.12]  feedback.
[3874.12 --> 3874.24]  back.
[3874.24 --> 3875.72]  It looks like a clear
[3875.72 --> 3879.08]  over 50% of you are
[3879.08 --> 3880.02]  willing to pay between
[3880.02 --> 3882.36]  five and $15 for an
[3882.36 --> 3883.80]  on-demand gaming service.
[3884.26 --> 3884.96]  This could be,
[3885.04 --> 3887.06]  no way is only 25%.
[3887.06 --> 3887.62]  Wow.
[3887.70 --> 3888.22]  That's right.
[3888.54 --> 3890.10]  This could be a,
[3890.40 --> 3890.68]  so,
[3890.76 --> 3891.18]  so hold on,
[3891.18 --> 3891.88]  let's look at this a
[3891.88 --> 3892.32]  different way.
[3892.40 --> 3892.70]  Hold on.
[3892.70 --> 3894.36]  So 31 plus 25 plus
[3894.36 --> 3895.38]  eight plus two.
[3895.52 --> 3898.28]  So plus 10 is 35 is 60,
[3898.82 --> 3899.68]  67.
[3900.20 --> 3902.50]  Two thirds of you are
[3902.50 --> 3903.82]  willing to pay more than
[3903.82 --> 3906.38]  $5 for grid premium a
[3906.38 --> 3906.74]  month.
[3907.34 --> 3908.74]  That is way easier to do
[3908.74 --> 3909.38]  if you just did the
[3909.38 --> 3909.74]  negative.
[3910.46 --> 3911.92]  If you just added no way
[3911.92 --> 3913.42]  and below $5 together and
[3913.42 --> 3914.14]  then took that away from
[3914.14 --> 3914.48]  a hundred.
[3918.72 --> 3919.76]  Either way though,
[3919.86 --> 3921.10]  that blows me away.
[3921.50 --> 3922.44]  Nvidia in,
[3922.44 --> 3923.94]  if Nvidia's long-term
[3923.94 --> 3924.34]  plan,
[3924.42 --> 3925.46]  and we've been talking
[3925.46 --> 3926.22]  about this for a long
[3926.22 --> 3926.50]  time,
[3926.54 --> 3926.66]  right,
[3926.72 --> 3926.92]  Luke?
[3927.36 --> 3928.38]  If Nvidia's long-term
[3928.38 --> 3931.52]  plan is to not make
[3931.52 --> 3933.08]  graphics cards anymore as
[3933.08 --> 3933.74]  their business,
[3934.40 --> 3935.20]  this is it.
[3935.48 --> 3936.32]  This is the time.
[3936.58 --> 3937.34]  It just happened.
[3938.36 --> 3938.46]  Yeah.
[3940.16 --> 3941.72]  Cause like a
[3941.72 --> 3943.24]  subscription service like
[3943.24 --> 3944.72]  this is the difference
[3944.72 --> 3946.10]  between being a company
[3946.10 --> 3947.38]  that makes widgets and
[3947.38 --> 3948.64]  being a company with like
[3948.64 --> 3949.16]  big,
[3949.74 --> 3951.64]  massive revenue to
[3951.64 --> 3952.74]  continue developing the
[3952.74 --> 3953.90]  service and to like,
[3953.96 --> 3954.22]  I mean,
[3954.28 --> 3954.92]  you look at what
[3954.92 --> 3955.66]  happened with Netflix.
[3955.66 --> 3956.68]  All of a sudden they go
[3956.68 --> 3957.02]  from,
[3957.24 --> 3958.14]  we're a streaming service
[3958.14 --> 3960.90]  to we develop original
[3960.90 --> 3961.68]  programming.
[3962.40 --> 3962.50]  Yeah.
[3962.62 --> 3963.86]  Like Nvidia could even get
[3963.86 --> 3964.80]  into games at that point
[3964.80 --> 3965.90]  considering how much they're
[3965.90 --> 3967.58]  already have their fingers
[3967.58 --> 3968.78]  pretty deep into development
[3968.78 --> 3969.44]  of games.
[3969.58 --> 3970.50]  And the development of game
[3970.50 --> 3971.98]  technologies and stuff like
[3971.98 --> 3972.28]  that.
[3972.50 --> 3973.02]  But then again,
[3973.14 --> 3973.78]  think about this.
[3973.94 --> 3975.24]  Imagine a world where
[3975.24 --> 3976.38]  Nvidia gets to make their
[3976.38 --> 3977.90]  own games and how poorly
[3977.90 --> 3978.98]  those will run on competing
[3978.98 --> 3979.38]  hardware.
[3980.66 --> 3980.92]  Yeah.
[3981.60 --> 3981.86]  Yeah.
[3982.10 --> 3983.36]  Or they would probably only
[3983.36 --> 3984.22]  release through the grid
[3984.22 --> 3984.60]  service.
[3984.70 --> 3985.24]  I was going to say,
[3985.32 --> 3986.42]  imagine a world where the
[3986.42 --> 3988.18]  only way to get access to a
[3988.18 --> 3988.94]  particular game.
[3989.78 --> 3992.14]  This is the Nvidia console.
[3992.30 --> 3993.30]  Grid is the console.
[3993.30 --> 3995.18]  That Android console is almost
[3995.18 --> 3996.42]  like hedging their bets.
[3996.94 --> 3998.82]  So you can like play stupid
[3998.82 --> 4000.44]  Android games or maybe great
[4000.44 --> 4001.50]  Android games or whatever.
[4001.66 --> 4002.86]  Nvidia seems to not care
[4002.86 --> 4003.76]  about that anymore.
[4004.00 --> 4005.54]  So you can play Android games
[4005.54 --> 4006.40]  on it or whatever,
[4006.40 --> 4008.20]  but you're going to need
[4008.20 --> 4010.70]  this to get grid and people
[4010.70 --> 4011.80]  are going to buy it.
[4012.38 --> 4012.48]  Yeah.
[4013.20 --> 4014.46]  Very interesting to me,
[4014.50 --> 4016.20]  especially if you look at how
[4016.20 --> 4018.04]  competitive their products
[4018.04 --> 4019.84]  are already with other
[4019.84 --> 4020.22]  devices.
[4020.34 --> 4021.72]  Like Shield tablet is a good
[4021.72 --> 4022.12]  tablet.
[4022.88 --> 4025.44]  Shield tablet with a $5 a month
[4025.44 --> 4026.84]  grid service is an
[4026.84 --> 4027.80]  unbelievable value.
[4028.94 --> 4029.22]  Yeah.
[4030.44 --> 4030.92]  Scary.
[4031.24 --> 4032.02]  It's kind of scary.
[4032.14 --> 4033.72]  Like I like Nvidia as much
[4033.72 --> 4034.40]  as the next guy,
[4034.40 --> 4035.90]  but they also,
[4035.90 --> 4037.30]  they also kind of scare me
[4037.30 --> 4037.74]  sometimes.
[4038.40 --> 4038.62]  Yeah.
[4038.98 --> 4039.70]  I don't know.
[4039.86 --> 4040.60]  I was talking to someone the
[4040.60 --> 4042.00]  other day about how like I,
[4042.42 --> 4043.82]  maybe this was even on WAN show.
[4043.92 --> 4044.18]  Wow.
[4044.34 --> 4044.88]  It might be.
[4044.98 --> 4045.66]  That's awkward.
[4046.20 --> 4048.88]  About how like I'm getting a
[4048.88 --> 4049.78]  little frustrated with Google
[4049.78 --> 4050.80]  because they're getting,
[4051.50 --> 4052.80]  they kind of dropped that do
[4052.80 --> 4054.36]  no evil thing.
[4054.44 --> 4055.62]  Don't be evil or whatever it is.
[4055.62 --> 4056.18]  And they're kind of doing a lot
[4056.18 --> 4057.00]  of evil lately.
[4057.28 --> 4059.18]  And like I'd way rather Microsoft
[4059.18 --> 4060.80]  be the big mega corporation
[4060.80 --> 4064.00]  because while I might not be a
[4064.00 --> 4065.84]  huge fan all the time,
[4065.84 --> 4067.60]  they don't seem to do like
[4067.60 --> 4069.10]  massively horrible things.
[4069.48 --> 4069.92]  Well,
[4069.98 --> 4070.24]  they've,
[4070.24 --> 4071.96]  they've gotten past it.
[4072.62 --> 4073.10]  Yeah.
[4073.30 --> 4074.56]  They've gotten over the hump.
[4074.90 --> 4075.38]  It's like,
[4075.38 --> 4076.02]  it's like,
[4076.06 --> 4077.14]  it's almost like you have to
[4077.14 --> 4077.38]  get,
[4077.60 --> 4078.96]  you have to become accustomed.
[4079.04 --> 4079.96]  You have to grow into your
[4079.96 --> 4080.42]  britches.
[4080.46 --> 4081.70]  You have to become accustomed to
[4081.70 --> 4082.64]  being a mega power.
[4082.80 --> 4083.90]  And then it's like,
[4084.38 --> 4084.90]  okay,
[4085.40 --> 4085.84]  you know,
[4085.84 --> 4086.28]  maybe we,
[4086.44 --> 4087.80]  maybe we just don't need to
[4087.80 --> 4088.52]  crush everything.
[4088.52 --> 4089.36]  Maybe we're okay.
[4089.54 --> 4090.28]  And like,
[4090.34 --> 4091.56]  they can also make a product
[4091.56 --> 4092.72]  and we can make a product.
[4093.08 --> 4093.48]  Yeah.
[4093.80 --> 4094.02]  Yeah.
[4094.10 --> 4094.90]  And that's cool.
[4095.36 --> 4096.56]  I don't know if Google will
[4096.56 --> 4097.90]  ever be okay with that though.
[4099.12 --> 4100.14]  I think Google's new motto
[4100.14 --> 4101.04]  needs to be,
[4101.04 --> 4101.78]  uh,
[4101.86 --> 4103.24]  world domination or nothing.
[4103.86 --> 4104.78]  Domination or nothing.
[4105.42 --> 4106.32]  They seem to be,
[4106.40 --> 4107.60]  they seem to be headed that way,
[4107.64 --> 4108.06]  don't they?
[4108.54 --> 4109.06]  I mean,
[4109.16 --> 4110.14]  they should just change it.
[4111.00 --> 4111.38]  I,
[4111.52 --> 4111.94]  uh,
[4112.66 --> 4113.52]  someone in the chat,
[4113.62 --> 4114.20]  developers,
[4114.48 --> 4115.02]  developers,
[4115.32 --> 4115.86]  developers,
[4115.86 --> 4116.06]  developers,
[4116.06 --> 4116.88]  developers.
[4116.88 --> 4119.32]  That should be like Pebble's motto.
[4119.70 --> 4120.76]  I don't want to talk about Pebble
[4120.76 --> 4121.66]  anymore on the stream,
[4121.78 --> 4123.26]  but they really do seem to be
[4123.26 --> 4124.04]  focused on,
[4124.32 --> 4125.10]  here's a platform,
[4125.74 --> 4126.72]  like make it,
[4126.78 --> 4127.38]  make it awesome.
[4127.50 --> 4128.78]  We'll make it as awesome as we can,
[4128.86 --> 4130.14]  but like you guys make it more
[4130.14 --> 4131.08]  awesome and that's great.
[4131.60 --> 4131.86]  Um,
[4131.88 --> 4132.10]  okay,
[4132.12 --> 4133.42]  we should probably do our sponsors.
[4133.90 --> 4134.16]  Um,
[4134.16 --> 4134.82]  speaking of,
[4134.84 --> 4135.88]  of making things awesome,
[4135.88 --> 4137.20]  actually you're going to be kind of,
[4137.48 --> 4139.38]  I didn't add you to the sponsor
[4139.38 --> 4139.90]  scenes,
[4139.90 --> 4141.20]  so you're just not here,

[4260.94 --> 4262.62]  you are hardcore missing out.
[4262.82 --> 4265.32]  And I'm really sorry that you have to miss out on this.
[4265.42 --> 4266.12]  The Lou crate?
[4267.36 --> 4267.76]  Yeah,
[4268.02 --> 4268.24]  yeah,
[4268.32 --> 4268.56]  sure.
[4269.02 --> 4269.20]  Uh,
[4269.20 --> 4271.60]  Nick's going to come in and hand cam it up for me,
[4271.60 --> 4274.30]  but I am unboxing this month.
[4274.42 --> 4275.32]  Luke crate.
[4275.68 --> 4276.04]  Woo.
[4276.62 --> 4277.86]  I feel abandoned.
[4278.40 --> 4278.54]  You,
[4278.66 --> 4281.28]  I went to Luke great today and tried to like talk to them,
[4281.34 --> 4283.12]  but they were being swarmed.
[4283.84 --> 4284.28]  Yeah,
[4284.36 --> 4284.72]  I bet.
[4284.84 --> 4285.92]  It was super full.
[4286.22 --> 4287.02]  There was no,
[4287.22 --> 4288.66]  there was no talking to them.
[4289.72 --> 4290.20]  Oh,
[4290.20 --> 4294.06]  I can't use that camera because it's being used by another application.
[4294.92 --> 4295.10]  You know,
[4295.14 --> 4295.68]  it's awkward.
[4295.68 --> 4298.06]  We should talk to our cameraman because,
[4298.06 --> 4299.16]  um,
[4299.16 --> 4300.18]  I'm pretty sure that,
[4300.32 --> 4306.36]  that like whatever camera Nick is holding right now has better color than the black magic.
[4306.46 --> 4306.70]  Oh,
[4306.80 --> 4307.04]  it's,
[4307.10 --> 4308.06]  it's because I,
[4308.18 --> 4309.26]  it's because I did it.
[4309.32 --> 4309.56]  Yeah.
[4309.56 --> 4310.44]  They could fix it.
[4310.64 --> 4310.98]  Okay.
[4310.98 --> 4311.26]  Well,
[4311.36 --> 4311.96]  I'm going to have to,
[4312.08 --> 4312.26]  uh,
[4312.46 --> 4314.12]  Skype is grabbing those.
[4314.52 --> 4314.88]  So,
[4314.98 --> 4315.42]  uh,
[4315.46 --> 4315.70]  yeah,
[4315.76 --> 4316.20]  it can't,
[4316.26 --> 4317.02]  it can't have that.
[4317.26 --> 4317.52]  All right.
[4317.54 --> 4317.66]  Well,
[4317.66 --> 4320.32]  I'm going to open up the loot crate and I'm just going to hold it up.
[4320.32 --> 4322.50]  Can you not put the camera where you just did?
[4323.26 --> 4323.66]  Wait,
[4323.72 --> 4323.84]  what?
[4323.84 --> 4324.00]  Oh,
[4324.06 --> 4324.82]  you can see it.
[4324.92 --> 4325.20]  Oh,
[4325.48 --> 4326.78]  right.
[4327.10 --> 4331.84]  Luke's watching me on this camera and Nick just like puts it down on the table.
[4332.12 --> 4333.64]  It's like a freaking troll.
[4333.84 --> 4334.80]  Look at that guy.
[4334.94 --> 4335.78]  What a guy.
[4336.22 --> 4337.06]  What a guy.
[4337.16 --> 4337.82]  That Nick guy.
[4338.18 --> 4339.20]  I hate that guy.
[4339.48 --> 4340.48]  I love that guy.
[4340.56 --> 4341.62]  I love everyone today.
[4342.22 --> 4343.14]  I'm just having like a,
[4343.20 --> 4344.08]  I'm having a love day.
[4344.42 --> 4344.58]  We,
[4344.66 --> 4344.78]  uh,
[4344.78 --> 4346.18]  we filmed channel super fun today.
[4346.38 --> 4347.42]  It was bananas.
[4347.58 --> 4348.76]  We did the soccer boppers.
[4349.10 --> 4349.38]  Oh,
[4349.38 --> 4350.50]  I missed that.
[4350.82 --> 4351.18]  Oh,
[4351.82 --> 4353.26]  I was hoping you guys were going to wait.
[4353.38 --> 4353.82]  No,
[4353.84 --> 4354.16]  no,
[4354.28 --> 4354.56]  sorry.
[4354.64 --> 4354.98]  We had to,
[4355.06 --> 4356.06]  we had to get her done.
[4356.66 --> 4356.88]  It,
[4357.00 --> 4357.58]  we,
[4357.70 --> 4359.58]  we went like tournament style again.
[4359.76 --> 4360.16]  Um,
[4360.20 --> 4360.46]  you know,
[4360.50 --> 4360.70]  those,
[4360.90 --> 4361.82]  you know,
[4361.82 --> 4366.48]  those old pies that were in the fridge from like that expired in like December.
[4367.48 --> 4368.20]  Oh no.
[4368.20 --> 4371.90]  All I'm going to say is the video involves those pies.
[4372.42 --> 4373.42]  Oh no,
[4374.08 --> 4375.66]  that's not good.
[4375.78 --> 4377.10]  There's no way that's good.
[4378.10 --> 4381.84]  So the upcoming channel super fun is going to be bananas,
[4381.84 --> 4382.48]  but let's,
[4382.56 --> 4382.68]  uh,
[4382.68 --> 4384.10]  let's open up this loot crate first.
[4384.48 --> 4385.02]  So I,
[4385.02 --> 4385.84]  I usually,
[4385.84 --> 4386.02]  I,
[4386.02 --> 4386.34]  I,
[4386.34 --> 4386.36]  I,
[4386.36 --> 4391.68]  Nick sends me notes on these things and I'm sure that I'm supposed to know stuff.
[4391.80 --> 4392.46]  go through it.
[4392.50 --> 4393.90]  That's like the whole thing with loot crate,
[4394.00 --> 4394.42]  but no,
[4394.50 --> 4394.62]  I,
[4394.78 --> 4396.60]  it would be nice if I knew at least the theme.
[4397.46 --> 4397.86]  Right.
[4398.00 --> 4398.34]  Okay.
[4398.60 --> 4398.86]  Yeah.
[4398.94 --> 4399.44]  We're usually,
[4399.88 --> 4401.10]  we're usually I don't.
[4401.46 --> 4401.74]  Uh,
[4401.74 --> 4404.12]  so this is February's play crate.
[4404.42 --> 4404.92]  All right.
[4404.98 --> 4405.34]  So what we go,
[4405.36 --> 4405.50]  Oh,
[4405.56 --> 4406.40]  these are awesome.
[4406.88 --> 4407.84]  It has a hex bug.
[4408.76 --> 4408.98]  Oh,
[4409.00 --> 4409.50]  that's cool.
[4409.66 --> 4411.06]  These things are freaking bananas.
[4411.22 --> 4411.36]  Uh,
[4411.36 --> 4412.36]  we actually did.
[4412.50 --> 4414.50]  I'll be speaking of channel super fun.
[4414.62 --> 4414.86]  Yeah.
[4414.98 --> 4415.14]  Yeah.
[4415.14 --> 4416.86]  It's not the same kind of hex bug.
[4416.98 --> 4417.56]  So it's,
[4417.64 --> 4417.82]  uh,
[4417.82 --> 4420.68]  this is the hex bug ant.
[4420.96 --> 4421.92]  So we did,
[4422.00 --> 4422.18]  uh,
[4422.20 --> 4423.42]  we did hex bug racing,
[4423.52 --> 4425.58]  the ones that just kind of vibrate on the table.
[4425.88 --> 4426.78]  And then they,
[4426.90 --> 4427.16]  uh,
[4427.20 --> 4427.38]  they,
[4427.48 --> 4428.32]  they kind of like move around.
[4428.34 --> 4430.66]  And then they kind of move around on the table.
[4430.88 --> 4432.98]  So we did hex bugs bug racing before,
[4433.24 --> 4436.00]  but this is a new kind of hex bug.
[4437.26 --> 4439.00]  And it's packaged extremely well.
[4439.28 --> 4442.56]  I claim to be a professional unboxer and I cannot get this out of the box.
[4443.14 --> 4443.42]  Well,
[4443.90 --> 4444.24]  well,
[4444.34 --> 4444.62]  right.
[4445.46 --> 4446.26]  I like that.
[4446.30 --> 4448.10]  It's crate packing simulator.
[4448.24 --> 4449.60]  And I think the box is actually,
[4449.76 --> 4450.06]  uh,
[4450.06 --> 4450.48]  uh,
[4450.48 --> 4451.34]  like a board game.
[4451.76 --> 4452.04]  Oh,
[4452.04 --> 4452.98]  no.
[4453.86 --> 4454.22]  I have,
[4454.34 --> 4454.94]  I have not,
[4455.18 --> 4455.42]  not,
[4455.54 --> 4457.42]  not for the bug for the whole loop.
[4457.42 --> 4457.70]  Yeah.
[4457.70 --> 4458.40]  I see that.
[4458.74 --> 4458.92]  Yeah.
[4459.02 --> 4461.20]  I have not noticed anything that isn't this ant.
[4461.32 --> 4462.22]  Oh my goodness.
[4462.38 --> 4463.06]  Look at this.
[4463.14 --> 4464.46]  It has little rolly wheels.
[4465.78 --> 4467.08]  That this thing is adorable.
[4468.40 --> 4468.76]  Whoa,
[4468.76 --> 4469.26]  it's fast.
[4469.38 --> 4469.72]  Whoa.
[4469.88 --> 4470.16]  Yeah.
[4470.30 --> 4470.88]  Holy cow.
[4470.96 --> 4471.54]  That's sick.
[4471.64 --> 4471.84]  Okay.
[4471.86 --> 4472.20]  Hold on.
[4472.42 --> 4472.70]  Let me,
[4472.78 --> 4472.94]  uh,
[4472.94 --> 4475.84]  I'm just going to put it on the back of my laptop so you guys can see how fast it is.
[4475.84 --> 4476.72]  Ah,
[4476.72 --> 4478.72]  no.
[4478.72 --> 4479.04]  Ah,
[4479.20 --> 4479.56]  no.
[4481.72 --> 4482.04]  Oh,
[4482.16 --> 4482.48]  I love,
[4482.56 --> 4483.22]  I love hex bugs.
[4483.30 --> 4483.42]  Okay.
[4483.46 --> 4485.68]  That's clearly not going to work what I'm trying to do right now,
[4485.74 --> 4486.54]  but it's got a little,
[4486.70 --> 4486.82]  uh,
[4486.82 --> 4489.00]  it's got a little wire in the front so it doesn't get stuck on anything.
[4489.00 --> 4489.92]  So it bounces off.
[4490.28 --> 4490.66]  All right.
[4490.66 --> 4491.50]  What else we got in here?
[4492.36 --> 4493.30]  Is that a book?
[4493.30 --> 4499.48]  How do they include a book in this?
[4499.56 --> 4500.06]  Like a full,
[4500.16 --> 4500.38]  wow,
[4500.44 --> 4501.06]  that's a full book.
[4501.12 --> 4501.24]  No,
[4501.28 --> 4502.30]  like an actual book.
[4502.74 --> 4504.64]  It's a ready player one.
[4505.36 --> 4507.80]  New York times bestseller by Ernest Cline.
[4507.80 --> 4508.72]  That's a really good book.
[4509.72 --> 4510.70]  Like legitimately.
[4511.42 --> 4512.48]  That is incredible.
[4512.48 --> 4516.66]  They must've had this done as a completely custom print for them because,
[4516.66 --> 4517.48]  um,
[4518.08 --> 4518.68]  the grownups,
[4518.78 --> 4519.22]  Harry Potter,
[4519.34 --> 4521.86]  apparently because there is no price on it.
[4521.86 --> 4523.84]  This seems to like there's,
[4523.92 --> 4525.76]  there's usually a price like an ISBN,
[4526.14 --> 4526.28]  blah,
[4526.30 --> 4526.38]  blah,
[4526.40 --> 4526.62]  blah,
[4526.66 --> 4526.68]  blah,
[4526.68 --> 4526.74]  blah,
[4526.74 --> 4527.16]  whatever.
[4527.42 --> 4527.66]  Well,
[4527.74 --> 4528.80]  let me look it up on Amazon.
[4528.94 --> 4529.70]  I know that book,
[4529.82 --> 4530.50]  like a hundred percent.
[4530.64 --> 4531.14]  I know that book.
[4531.50 --> 4532.28]  That's awesome.
[4532.98 --> 4533.26]  All right.
[4533.26 --> 4534.70]  I was like thinking about getting it.
[4534.88 --> 4535.82]  Now we've got,
[4535.92 --> 4536.20]  uh,
[4536.20 --> 4539.24]  create your own vinyl art toy money world.
[4539.62 --> 4540.40]  That's pretty cute.
[4540.48 --> 4541.38]  So this is a mini money money.
[4543.42 --> 4545.08]  It comes with three markers,
[4545.24 --> 4545.52]  black,
[4545.68 --> 4545.90]  red,
[4545.94 --> 4546.52]  and blue.
[4546.54 --> 4547.86]  And you go ahead and like draw on it.
[4548.30 --> 4549.12]  That's pretty adorable.
[4549.44 --> 4550.56]  And then what else we got?
[4550.62 --> 4551.72]  This looks like a little poster.
[4552.66 --> 4554.04]  I'm going to go ahead and try and open this baby.
[4554.60 --> 4556.70]  I like these loot crate sponsor spots.
[4556.80 --> 4558.48]  We always go way over time on them,
[4558.56 --> 4559.20]  but we do.
[4559.30 --> 4560.10]  They're just kind of fun.
[4560.62 --> 4563.40]  So ready player one is $17.
[4564.84 --> 4565.24]  Wow.
[4565.82 --> 4566.38]  I don't,
[4566.46 --> 4568.06]  I think loot crate increased their pricing though.
[4568.06 --> 4568.24]  Right.
[4568.72 --> 4569.76]  I don't think it's one,
[4569.86 --> 4569.96]  three,
[4570.06 --> 4570.24]  three,
[4570.42 --> 4570.98]  seven anymore.
[4571.12 --> 4571.32]  Yeah,
[4571.36 --> 4571.90]  but it's,
[4572.02 --> 4573.70]  I think that's only in Canada.
[4573.70 --> 4575.64]  And I think that's because of the dollar issues.
[4575.88 --> 4576.08]  Right.
[4576.46 --> 4577.28]  I'm not sure though.
[4577.50 --> 4578.10]  This is cute.
[4578.90 --> 4579.70]  So it's like,
[4580.02 --> 4581.56]  I don't know.
[4582.18 --> 4582.66]  I don't know.
[4582.66 --> 4583.56]  Console or something.
[4584.40 --> 4584.74]  It's packing.
[4584.74 --> 4585.64]  I can't really see.
[4585.82 --> 4586.02]  Yeah,
[4586.06 --> 4586.36]  that's fine.
[4586.86 --> 4587.56]  What else we got?
[4587.60 --> 4587.90]  Oh yeah.
[4588.04 --> 4588.34]  Yeah.
[4588.34 --> 4589.30]  I'm not holding it up to you.
[4589.36 --> 4590.16]  I'm holding it up to that.
[4590.22 --> 4590.46]  Yeah.
[4590.46 --> 4591.10]  All right.
[4591.14 --> 4593.84]  So crate packing simulator 2015 game instructions.
[4594.02 --> 4594.92]  Welcome to loot crates.
[4595.02 --> 4596.86]  First original board game.
[4597.02 --> 4598.48]  So you can see there's like game board in there.
[4599.38 --> 4600.56]  The goal is simple.
[4600.76 --> 4603.10]  Be the first player to have all five items in your crate.
[4603.60 --> 4604.12]  Use the rock,
[4604.18 --> 4604.34]  paper,
[4604.44 --> 4604.62]  scissors,
[4604.76 --> 4607.34]  dice to determine who will make the first move.
[4607.46 --> 4608.76]  Once the first player is chosen,
[4608.88 --> 4609.64]  continue to use rock,
[4609.70 --> 4609.78]  paper,
[4609.86 --> 4609.98]  scissors,
[4610.08 --> 4612.12]  dice with these numerical values to move your game token.
[4612.56 --> 4614.94]  So depending on who plays what you move one,
[4615.02 --> 4615.58]  two or three,
[4615.90 --> 4616.54]  land on a star,
[4616.64 --> 4617.34]  pick up one item,
[4617.48 --> 4618.16]  land on a circle,
[4618.30 --> 4618.84]  dice battle,
[4619.00 --> 4619.12]  blah,
[4619.14 --> 4619.22]  blah,
[4619.22 --> 4619.38]  blah,
[4619.46 --> 4619.70]  et cetera,
[4619.76 --> 4620.00]  et cetera.
[4620.00 --> 4620.32]  Oh,
[4620.76 --> 4621.04]  neat.
[4621.84 --> 4626.68]  So it seems to include items from previous loot crates,
[4626.78 --> 4628.00]  like the eight bit glasses.
[4628.24 --> 4628.32]  Oh,
[4628.42 --> 4628.64]  okay.
[4628.64 --> 4629.74]  So I guess this is like,
[4629.82 --> 4632.30]  if you are already subscribed or something,
[4632.56 --> 4633.28]  then that's good.
[4633.92 --> 4634.10]  Yeah.
[4634.42 --> 4634.80]  All right.
[4634.90 --> 4636.52]  It comes with super fight,
[4636.64 --> 4638.00]  the loot crate deck.
[4638.82 --> 4641.76]  This is a 100 card version of the viral card game,
[4641.88 --> 4644.74]  super fight designed exclusively for loot crate by sky bound.
[4644.96 --> 4647.28]  These cards are only available in this exclusive deck.
[4648.60 --> 4649.04]  Jeez,
[4649.04 --> 4649.94]  this one's got a lot.
[4650.08 --> 4650.52]  There's a button.
[4650.74 --> 4650.98]  Yeah.
[4651.88 --> 4652.32]  Um,
[4652.72 --> 4653.50]  there's the rock,
[4653.56 --> 4653.72]  paper,
[4653.82 --> 4654.00]  scissors,
[4654.14 --> 4654.44]  dice.
[4654.90 --> 4656.10]  So it's got rocks,
[4656.20 --> 4656.44]  papers,
[4656.44 --> 4657.34]  and scissors on it.
[4657.72 --> 4658.06]  Well,
[4658.06 --> 4659.32]  maybe everything is included with this one.
[4659.32 --> 4660.46]  I don't see eight bit glasses though.
[4661.42 --> 4661.78]  Um,
[4661.94 --> 4662.40]  interesting.
[4663.24 --> 4664.06]  What else we got.
[4664.28 --> 4665.70]  There's a firefly online,
[4666.10 --> 4668.16]  Buddhist temple concept art thing.
[4668.82 --> 4669.44]  Firefly online.
[4669.68 --> 4671.02]  Is that an upcoming game or something?
[4671.62 --> 4671.76]  Yeah,
[4671.82 --> 4672.06]  man.
[4672.52 --> 4673.50]  I hadn't even heard of that.
[4673.98 --> 4674.12]  Yeah,
[4674.16 --> 4674.38]  dude.
[4674.52 --> 4675.78]  I hope it's not as bad as the movie.
[4675.88 --> 4676.88]  I never finished the movie.
[4677.40 --> 4678.68]  I don't know if I told you that.
[4678.82 --> 4678.98]  Yeah,
[4679.08 --> 4679.30]  that,
[4679.30 --> 4680.20]  that did not happen.
[4680.74 --> 4681.52]  And then their,
[4681.58 --> 4681.80]  uh,
[4681.80 --> 4683.94]  their loot crate magazine has a history of game controllers.
[4685.08 --> 4685.44]  Cool.
[4686.18 --> 4687.76]  It might be as bad as the movie.
[4688.36 --> 4689.08]  I sincerely,
[4689.18 --> 4689.32]  oh,
[4689.36 --> 4690.76]  and game pieces for the board game.
[4690.90 --> 4693.30]  I sincerely hope it's not as bad as the movie because,
[4693.46 --> 4693.86]  oh man,
[4693.92 --> 4694.48]  like I,
[4694.82 --> 4696.40]  I really enjoyed the show.
[4697.00 --> 4697.40]  Uh,
[4697.44 --> 4697.66]  anyway,
[4697.78 --> 4697.98]  right.
[4698.18 --> 4700.06]  Use offer code Linus to save 10% on loot crate.
[4700.52 --> 4700.90]  Um,
[4701.04 --> 4702.78]  I really enjoyed the show,
[4702.92 --> 4705.68]  but that movie was bad.
[4705.72 --> 4707.28]  It did not know what it was.
[4707.34 --> 4708.18]  It had no identity.
[4708.18 --> 4709.30]  It had no charm.
[4709.44 --> 4709.94]  It just,
[4710.36 --> 4714.38]  it was just like trying too hard to be mission impossible kind of thing.
[4714.56 --> 4714.64]  Right.
[4714.64 --> 4716.10]  I still liked it,
[4716.14 --> 4716.54]  but like,
[4716.74 --> 4716.96]  yeah,
[4717.28 --> 4719.32]  I liked it because I'm a fan boy of firefly.
[4719.64 --> 4721.62]  Not because it's yeah.
[4722.08 --> 4722.52]  Anyways.
[4723.16 --> 4723.60]  Yeah.
[4723.88 --> 4727.16]  I just looked it up and apparently it's a thing already.
[4727.76 --> 4728.00]  Oh,
[4728.06 --> 4728.96]  I didn't know it was released,
[4729.12 --> 4731.26]  but it looks super not good.
[4732.34 --> 4733.02]  All right.
[4733.08 --> 4734.00]  Then well,
[4734.04 --> 4734.48]  at any rate,
[4734.48 --> 4736.28]  everything else in that loot crate was pretty fun.
[4737.22 --> 4737.44]  Yeah.
[4738.20 --> 4738.52]  Um,
[4738.76 --> 4739.50]  it might be good.
[4739.60 --> 4740.00]  I don't know.
[4740.14 --> 4741.02]  This is kind of a,
[4741.14 --> 4744.62]  so we'll get into rapid fire topics because we're actually coming pretty close to the end of the show.
[4744.64 --> 4744.88]  Here.
[4744.96 --> 4748.22]  WhatsApp now permanently bans users using third party apps.
[4748.44 --> 4748.88]  Uh,
[4748.88 --> 4751.98]  Facebook has been cracking down on the developers of third party apps,
[4751.98 --> 4758.56]  and now they are just outright banning people who insist on using them by blacklisting their phone numbers.
[4758.98 --> 4761.32]  So while you could get a new phone number,
[4761.72 --> 4762.20]  um,
[4762.32 --> 4766.24]  it is going to be a real pain in the butt to try to use third party apps on WhatsApp.
[4766.24 --> 4769.64]  You must use the official app from now on.
[4769.70 --> 4771.32]  This is posted by Victoria's secret on the forum.
[4771.42 --> 4772.66]  Did you post this one in chat?
[4772.86 --> 4773.48]  I did already.
[4773.78 --> 4774.14]  Wow.
[4774.26 --> 4775.28]  I don't even see you moving.
[4775.34 --> 4776.94]  You're like a freaking ninja over there.
[4776.98 --> 4777.58]  I'm a ghost.
[4777.72 --> 4777.88]  Hey,
[4777.90 --> 4779.46]  are we both wearing the same shirt today?
[4779.90 --> 4780.54]  We are actually.
[4780.76 --> 4781.08]  Nice.
[4781.64 --> 4782.00]  Yes.
[4782.48 --> 4782.84]  Nice.
[4782.84 --> 4785.52]  I made sure that I had a proper show shirts.
[4785.62 --> 4786.52]  And then when I got here,
[4786.56 --> 4788.56]  I realized that my keep on digging shirt is a medium.
[4789.76 --> 4790.20]  Nice.
[4790.34 --> 4791.70]  That is going to be hot.
[4792.60 --> 4795.98]  That is like going to be some sexy stuff going on over there.
[4796.78 --> 4798.22]  I am liking it already.
[4798.34 --> 4799.84]  I haven't even seen these goods.
[4800.34 --> 4800.50]  Oh,
[4800.64 --> 4801.18]  geez.
[4802.58 --> 4802.98]  Well,
[4803.04 --> 4803.56]  you have.
[4804.08 --> 4804.28]  Yeah.
[4804.40 --> 4804.66]  Okay.
[4804.78 --> 4804.90]  Well,
[4804.94 --> 4805.12]  not,
[4805.16 --> 4805.36]  not,
[4805.48 --> 4806.10]  not today.
[4806.88 --> 4807.04]  Yeah,
[4807.16 --> 4807.34]  no,
[4807.36 --> 4807.76]  that's true.
[4808.16 --> 4808.28]  Yeah.
[4808.28 --> 4809.72]  Who says I didn't video it?
[4810.30 --> 4812.42]  They make real small cameras these days.
[4812.72 --> 4813.94]  Oh my God.
[4814.52 --> 4814.72]  Uh,
[4814.80 --> 4818.38]  Huawei is the next Nexus maker,
[4818.64 --> 4820.88]  confirms Kevin Yang from iSupply.
[4821.26 --> 4821.52]  Uh,
[4821.52 --> 4823.32]  this is posted by Victoria's Secret.
[4823.80 --> 4826.66]  Google partnering up with a Chinese OEM for the new Nexus.
[4826.84 --> 4829.50]  So Huawei is the biggest competitor to Xiaomi.
[4830.14 --> 4830.62]  And,
[4830.72 --> 4831.12]  um,
[4831.16 --> 4835.34]  they're also apparently partnering with LG on another Nexus device later in 2015.
[4836.10 --> 4836.52]  Um,
[4836.60 --> 4837.54]  the speculation,
[4837.54 --> 4840.72]  the original article here is from Gizmokina.
[4841.82 --> 4843.06]  I'm going to go ahead and,
[4843.06 --> 4843.34]  uh,
[4843.34 --> 4844.48]  throw that up on the screen here.
[4844.56 --> 4850.28]  But the speculation is that maybe we will see a return to affordable Nexus devices.
[4851.32 --> 4851.54]  Uh,
[4851.54 --> 4852.44]  this doesn't seem to be,
[4852.48 --> 4852.60]  yeah,
[4852.64 --> 4853.10]  here we go.
[4853.18 --> 4855.08]  Could Huawei be the next Nexus maker?
[4855.50 --> 4855.98]  Um,
[4855.98 --> 4858.94]  I would really like to see that in my mind,
[4859.18 --> 4861.28]  the Nexus 6 was a disaster,
[4861.50 --> 4861.98]  uh,
[4861.98 --> 4863.14]  between Lollipop,
[4863.50 --> 4866.34]  me seeing people refer to it as Android Vista.
[4866.34 --> 4867.34]  Um,
[4867.44 --> 4868.14]  and,
[4868.32 --> 4873.16]  and just the fact that that hardware was so expensive for something that didn't offer a tangibly
[4873.16 --> 4875.74]  better experience than,
[4875.74 --> 4876.56]  um,
[4876.64 --> 4877.84]  you know,
[4877.88 --> 4879.80]  other similarly priced pieces of hardware.
[4879.80 --> 4882.22]  I just couldn't get into the Nexus 6.
[4882.46 --> 4882.90]  Uh,
[4882.90 --> 4884.46]  very much prefer the Droid Turbo,
[4884.46 --> 4886.14]  although I've been using the Moto E.
[4886.68 --> 4887.06]  And,
[4887.16 --> 4887.40]  uh,
[4887.40 --> 4888.62]  so far I can tell you guys,
[4888.78 --> 4890.94]  it's $150 phone.
[4891.84 --> 4893.84]  Whatever my expectations were going in,
[4894.44 --> 4895.26]  they were too high.
[4896.08 --> 4896.38]  Um,
[4897.04 --> 4897.64]  yeah,
[4897.72 --> 4897.96]  I'm not,
[4897.96 --> 4899.40]  I'm not too impressed with it so far,
[4899.40 --> 4899.86]  but I gotta,
[4900.06 --> 4900.86]  I'm in the video,
[4900.96 --> 4907.58]  I'm going to try to do a better job of understanding in my brain space that it's a $150 phone.
[4908.02 --> 4909.42]  In my brain space.
[4909.62 --> 4910.18]  I honestly,
[4910.52 --> 4911.94]  like between you and me,
[4912.00 --> 4912.24]  Luke,
[4912.62 --> 4913.12]  um,
[4913.28 --> 4915.74]  I have been seriously putting off doing phone reviews.
[4915.86 --> 4917.94]  It's not like there haven't been phones that I could look at.
[4918.10 --> 4920.44]  I could have done a later review of the 6 Plus.
[4920.84 --> 4921.24]  Um,
[4921.24 --> 4922.88]  I could have done the Z3 Compact,
[4922.96 --> 4925.12]  something people have been asking me to review forever.
[4925.12 --> 4925.56]  Um,
[4926.56 --> 4926.84]  you know,
[4926.90 --> 4928.12]  I could have done the Note 4,
[4928.48 --> 4929.02]  something we,
[4929.04 --> 4930.54]  we definitely had access to.
[4930.62 --> 4931.26]  And I was just like,
[4932.20 --> 4932.56]  eh,
[4932.64 --> 4933.84]  I did the Nexus 6.
[4934.36 --> 4935.86]  Big phones are still too big.
[4936.16 --> 4936.48]  So,
[4937.94 --> 4938.78]  there's that.
[4939.10 --> 4941.58]  So my Note 4 review would just be that in a nutshell,
[4941.86 --> 4943.80]  but with like touch whiz over top of it.
[4944.18 --> 4944.40]  Yeah,
[4944.56 --> 4944.78]  yeah,
[4944.78 --> 4945.00]  yeah.
[4945.22 --> 4945.82]  Oh no.
[4946.48 --> 4946.90]  Um,
[4947.08 --> 4947.46]  so,
[4947.84 --> 4952.06]  I've been putting it off because I love the Droid Turbo and I just hate switching my phone,
[4952.40 --> 4954.28]  especially because I like using that phone so much.
[4954.28 --> 4954.50]  So,
[4954.86 --> 4956.76]  the Moto E has been a rude awakening.
[4957.56 --> 4959.44]  There was a Kaylee cosplayer,
[4959.74 --> 4963.52]  so I took a picture with her and I had Brandon take the picture on my phone.
[4963.92 --> 4964.58]  And Brandon was like,
[4964.68 --> 4965.04]  wow,
[4965.20 --> 4965.40]  yeah,
[4965.48 --> 4965.88]  you're right.
[4965.94 --> 4967.70]  The camera's really bad.
[4969.48 --> 4970.04]  It's like,
[4970.10 --> 4970.34]  yeah,
[4970.40 --> 4970.64]  man,
[4970.70 --> 4971.00]  it's,
[4971.00 --> 4971.34]  it's,
[4971.34 --> 4972.10]  it's horrible.
[4972.10 --> 4972.68]  I think,
[4972.90 --> 4975.06]  I think the Moto E second gen,
[4975.18 --> 4975.46]  actually,
[4975.54 --> 4977.42]  I like the camera better than your old Moto X.
[4977.76 --> 4978.16]  Probably.
[4978.36 --> 4979.40]  It's not that bad,
[4979.48 --> 4980.90]  but it has no flash.
[4981.68 --> 4981.92]  Yeah.
[4982.24 --> 4983.18]  No flash.
[4983.18 --> 4984.64]  How am I gonna,
[4984.76 --> 4987.48]  how am I gonna have a flashlight when I'm crawling around in my attic?
[4988.16 --> 4989.26]  That's so stupid.
[4990.32 --> 4992.08]  How much does an LED cost?
[4992.76 --> 4993.60]  Not much.
[4993.94 --> 4994.76]  I can tell you that much.
[4995.68 --> 4996.08]  Anyway,
[4996.40 --> 4996.62]  uh,
[4996.72 --> 4997.84]  Gabe Newell,
[4997.84 --> 5000.10]  this was posted by Ah Ming on the forum,
[5000.38 --> 5000.76]  says,
[5000.90 --> 5001.80]  and I quote,
[5001.80 --> 5014.18]  zero percent of people get motion sick using the new Vive VR headset that was a collaborative effort between Valve and HTC.
[5014.82 --> 5016.66]  Holy balls.
[5016.66 --> 5023.42]  So they are using a completely new system for motion tracking that they're calling Lighthouse.
[5023.56 --> 5026.08]  And the way that this works is it actually has,
[5026.50 --> 5026.72]  um,
[5026.72 --> 5030.00]  I forget if they are sensors or emitters,
[5030.12 --> 5033.82]  but either the headset has emitters and they're sensors or the other way around.
[5033.82 --> 5034.52]  Um,
[5034.52 --> 5042.06]  but it has these devices in the corners of the room that are constantly monitoring where you are in relation to them.
[5042.06 --> 5045.86]  And they can even track not just the headset itself,
[5045.86 --> 5051.34]  but also peripheral devices or even multiple people with headsets and peripherals.
[5051.88 --> 5053.82]  This looks bananas.
[5054.48 --> 5060.50]  Oculus had a window where there was going to be no competition and the Rift was going to win.
[5060.74 --> 5064.06]  That window is closing extremely quickly.
[5064.90 --> 5065.78]  That window's gone.
[5066.20 --> 5066.48]  Uh,
[5066.48 --> 5066.84]  did you,
[5067.00 --> 5067.18]  I don't,
[5067.22 --> 5068.24]  I don't know if you've heard this,
[5068.24 --> 5075.48]  but the Rift like in what seems def what in what definitely seems like a response to the Vive,
[5075.60 --> 5076.30]  the Rift,
[5076.42 --> 5076.74]  uh,
[5076.74 --> 5078.40]  they've kind of stepped back and been like,
[5078.48 --> 5078.84]  Whoa,
[5079.20 --> 5083.26]  we might've said a release date that might be a little earlier than we expected.
[5083.50 --> 5085.90]  So we might be releasing later and all this kind of stuff.
[5085.94 --> 5087.68]  And they're kind of pushing theirs back now,
[5087.74 --> 5092.10]  which means that the Vive might actually have a consumer release before,
[5092.10 --> 5093.22]  um,
[5093.80 --> 5094.54]  CV one.
[5096.10 --> 5096.54]  Wow.
[5096.54 --> 5099.18]  Oculus might've just got super wrecked.
[5099.42 --> 5099.80]  Um,
[5099.86 --> 5100.08]  it's,
[5100.12 --> 5100.66]  it's a lot of,
[5100.70 --> 5102.00]  it's still kind of rumor mill stuff,
[5102.08 --> 5102.50]  but yeah,
[5102.96 --> 5104.52]  it was late 2015.
[5104.52 --> 5105.62]  That was the plan.
[5105.80 --> 5106.06]  Yeah.
[5106.56 --> 5107.46]  And then there,
[5107.60 --> 5107.78]  there,
[5107.86 --> 5110.20]  there's been rumor mill going around that they're going like,
[5110.32 --> 5110.78]  Hmm,
[5110.78 --> 5112.60]  we might've kind of estimated that wrong.
[5112.66 --> 5114.20]  We might have to do it a little bit later,
[5114.20 --> 5117.76]  which could be really bad because Vive is apparently ready to go.
[5119.12 --> 5119.56]  Wow.
[5119.76 --> 5120.12]  I,
[5120.28 --> 5120.50]  uh,
[5120.50 --> 5121.06]  you know what,
[5121.06 --> 5121.88]  for me,
[5122.38 --> 5123.50]  it's going to come down to this.
[5123.64 --> 5125.28]  Like I'll probably get them all anyway,
[5125.28 --> 5126.58]  because to review them,
[5126.64 --> 5130.12]  but the one that I buy with my personal credit card,
[5130.20 --> 5133.46]  not the company card to sit and collect dust at the office.
[5133.46 --> 5134.26]  Cause it's not mine.
[5134.32 --> 5136.72]  The one that I buy and take home,
[5136.72 --> 5141.04]  the one that I like order two of one on each card where I'm going to need one.
[5141.04 --> 5142.46]  And we're going to need one for,
[5142.54 --> 5142.74]  you know,
[5142.78 --> 5143.20]  testing,
[5143.36 --> 5143.76]  you know,
[5143.76 --> 5145.58]  graphics card performance with VR headsets.
[5145.58 --> 5145.80]  Like,
[5146.00 --> 5147.60]  like we're going to need all of them at the office.
[5147.60 --> 5154.88]  The one that I buy is going to be the one that is released and supports Eve Valkyrie,
[5155.42 --> 5156.08]  elite dangerous.
[5156.66 --> 5157.88]  And at a later date,
[5157.98 --> 5158.16]  stars,
[5158.24 --> 5158.50]  it doesn't,
[5158.58 --> 5163.40]  cause we are nowhere near the amount of graphics horsepower to run that game and nowhere near release elite dangerous and
[5163.40 --> 5164.22]  Eve Valkyrie,
[5164.46 --> 5165.68]  whatever supports those.
[5165.68 --> 5167.12]  If it's $200,
[5167.56 --> 5168.10]  I'll buy it.
[5168.16 --> 5168.84]  If it's $300,
[5169.28 --> 5169.94]  I'll buy it.
[5170.04 --> 5170.80]  And if it's $500,
[5171.22 --> 5172.30]  I'm going to buy it.
[5172.96 --> 5175.64]  One thing that's going to be interesting is,
[5175.64 --> 5176.50]  um,
[5177.36 --> 5177.96]  Valve,
[5178.28 --> 5181.02]  obviously really good relationship with a lot of different publishers.
[5181.60 --> 5182.16]  Um,
[5182.28 --> 5183.50]  but relationship,
[5184.32 --> 5186.32]  Oculus is becoming a publisher.
[5187.06 --> 5188.36]  And I believe,
[5188.56 --> 5190.60]  is Oculus not publishing Valkyrie?
[5191.42 --> 5192.44]  I don't remember.
[5193.22 --> 5195.30]  I think Oculus might be publishing Valkyrie,
[5195.40 --> 5197.02]  meaning that it might not go to Vive.
[5197.64 --> 5198.20]  I know,
[5198.34 --> 5200.58]  I think it was going to Morpheus or something else.
[5200.78 --> 5201.14]  Um,
[5201.96 --> 5202.72]  but yeah,
[5202.84 --> 5204.72]  I think they might be able to lock that down,
[5204.78 --> 5206.76]  which is going to make this really unfortunate,
[5207.00 --> 5211.12]  but really interesting at the same time and could kind of start a war between Vive and Rift,
[5211.12 --> 5213.74]  which would be pretty interesting to see.
[5214.12 --> 5214.92]  I'm very,
[5215.32 --> 5217.16]  very happy that this happened because,
[5217.28 --> 5218.00]  um,
[5218.04 --> 5220.46]  going to places like CES and seeing the sheer,
[5220.46 --> 5228.00]  sheer amount of VR stuff that was there that was just all garbage was super disappointing because I like,
[5228.10 --> 5229.56]  I went to CES and was like,
[5229.62 --> 5229.84]  okay,
[5229.84 --> 5233.00]  this is going to be sick because I'm going to see the new revision of,
[5233.10 --> 5233.44]  uh,
[5233.44 --> 5233.94]  the Oculus,
[5234.08 --> 5234.90]  which is going to be great.
[5234.94 --> 5235.50]  The Oculus Rift,
[5235.56 --> 5236.34]  which is going to be great.
[5236.62 --> 5237.02]  Um,
[5237.02 --> 5240.32]  and then I'm going to see all this other stuff and I'm excited to see the competition.
[5240.56 --> 5242.20]  And I got to CES and I was like,
[5242.24 --> 5244.62]  there is no competition there.
[5244.76 --> 5248.60]  I am not seeing the competition because it is not here because it doesn't exist.
[5248.60 --> 5254.72]  And then now finally there's one that can push them and apparently really freaking hard,
[5254.98 --> 5256.98]  which is great.
[5257.24 --> 5258.58]  I'm so happy that this happened.
[5258.70 --> 5259.46]  I'm liking this.
[5259.54 --> 5259.76]  I'm,
[5259.76 --> 5260.42]  I'm stoked,
[5260.56 --> 5260.96]  which I am.
[5261.02 --> 5261.40]  You're right.
[5261.42 --> 5262.86]  It's a co-publishing deal.
[5262.86 --> 5264.30]  And so I,
[5264.36 --> 5265.32]  I may not get to,
[5265.38 --> 5265.52]  okay,
[5265.60 --> 5266.98]  I'll settle for elite dangerous then.
[5267.36 --> 5267.72]  Um,
[5268.02 --> 5269.06]  are you going to buy it by the way?
[5269.08 --> 5269.68]  Have you tried it?
[5270.50 --> 5271.00]  Elite dangerous?
[5271.16 --> 5271.36]  Yeah.
[5272.06 --> 5273.24]  I've tried it a little bit.
[5273.26 --> 5274.38]  It seems actually pretty sick.
[5274.48 --> 5274.86]  I'll,
[5274.94 --> 5276.22]  I'll very likely buy it.
[5276.44 --> 5276.56]  Yeah.
[5276.56 --> 5276.72]  Okay,
[5276.72 --> 5276.94]  cool.
[5277.52 --> 5277.74]  Well,
[5277.74 --> 5278.10]  we should,
[5278.16 --> 5282.86]  we should start playing like seriously playing around the same time so we can like bro it up.
[5283.30 --> 5283.54]  You know,
[5283.56 --> 5283.86]  it's funny.
[5284.40 --> 5285.80]  So many people,
[5286.00 --> 5289.22]  so many people were like really confused by that,
[5289.22 --> 5292.00]  that spat that we had at the end of that tech wiki video.
[5292.88 --> 5293.22]  The what?
[5293.36 --> 5293.58]  Oh,
[5293.68 --> 5294.12]  oh yeah.
[5294.44 --> 5294.72]  Okay.
[5294.86 --> 5295.80]  So I want to,
[5295.86 --> 5297.90]  I want to go on the record and clarify that.
[5298.02 --> 5298.42]  Um,
[5298.54 --> 5300.46]  the Luke was going to host that video.
[5300.62 --> 5301.56]  That was the plan,
[5301.62 --> 5304.24]  but Luke was really sick and lost his voice.
[5304.44 --> 5306.44]  So I had to come host it.
[5306.44 --> 5315.64]  And then fractal Josh from fractal put Luke up to quitting like on camera in the middle of me filming.
[5316.00 --> 5321.26]  And then the plan from Josh's side was for me to not know what was happening.
[5321.26 --> 5322.26]  Yeah.
[5322.26 --> 5323.66]  But that's dumb.
[5324.10 --> 5325.56]  So Nick told me.
[5325.70 --> 5328.74]  So the whole thing was completely staged.
[5329.50 --> 5329.62]  So,
[5329.90 --> 5331.22]  so I think we,
[5331.38 --> 5333.64]  I think some people were like,
[5334.04 --> 5335.14]  some people were like,
[5335.86 --> 5336.54]  um,
[5336.68 --> 5339.10]  that was really like awkward and hard to watch.
[5339.46 --> 5339.78]  Um,
[5339.78 --> 5342.96]  I think we might've overdone a little bit and we probably should have,
[5343.14 --> 5346.62]  we probably should have clarified at the end that like that didn't happen.
[5346.62 --> 5347.58]  Yeah.
[5348.12 --> 5348.84]  Because that was,
[5348.96 --> 5349.40]  you did.
[5349.48 --> 5350.86]  I didn't even know because I,
[5350.90 --> 5352.64]  I walked out of the door and then as,
[5352.74 --> 5353.72]  as some people noticed,
[5353.72 --> 5355.32]  I wasn't wearing shoes.
[5355.74 --> 5356.10]  So,
[5356.42 --> 5359.02]  so I walked out of the door and I just kind of like stood on the,
[5359.02 --> 5359.24]  the,
[5359.32 --> 5363.02]  on the mat outside of the door with my ear to the door waiting for you to be done.
[5363.02 --> 5364.54]  But I couldn't really hear what you were saying.
[5364.62 --> 5365.94]  And I could just tell that you were talking.
[5365.94 --> 5367.08]  So I,
[5367.08 --> 5369.86]  I had no idea that there wasn't a clarification until it went live,
[5369.94 --> 5374.84]  which was kind of hilarious because the sheer amount of like forum PMs,
[5375.18 --> 5375.68]  tweets,
[5375.98 --> 5376.44]  uh,
[5376.44 --> 5378.94]  just everything that I got was just insane.
[5379.08 --> 5380.78]  And I loved it where people would be like,
[5380.96 --> 5381.26]  well,
[5381.66 --> 5385.28]  he walked out not wearing shoes and with a mic pack on his hip.
[5385.28 --> 5387.40]  So it's probably fine.
[5388.92 --> 5390.40]  That was awesome.
[5391.18 --> 5391.36]  Uh,
[5391.42 --> 5391.60]  Oh,
[5391.74 --> 5394.54]  Nick wanted me to let you guys know that the merch.linus,
[5394.60 --> 5395.32]  tech tips.com,
[5395.32 --> 5395.84]  the store,
[5395.96 --> 5396.40]  uh,
[5396.40 --> 5397.46]  has been restocked.
[5397.48 --> 5399.44]  I've had a lot of people messaging me being like,
[5399.54 --> 5399.84]  yo,
[5400.02 --> 5401.02]  at the end of your videos,
[5401.02 --> 5401.66]  you're always like,
[5401.92 --> 5402.10]  Hey,
[5402.12 --> 5403.36]  you could buy a t-shirt like this one.
[5403.40 --> 5404.02]  I went in your store.
[5404.10 --> 5405.14]  There's like no t-shirts,
[5405.28 --> 5405.46]  dude.
[5406.30 --> 5407.06]  And I was like,
[5407.66 --> 5408.44]  yeah,
[5408.44 --> 5409.04]  uh,
[5409.04 --> 5410.08]  we have a new rep at,
[5410.20 --> 5410.66]  um,
[5410.92 --> 5411.90]  at district lines.
[5412.10 --> 5412.42]  Um,
[5412.42 --> 5414.48]  apparently lanyards are going to be coming soon.
[5414.84 --> 5417.00]  I had sort of forgotten about that.
[5417.06 --> 5417.84]  So that's,
[5417.88 --> 5418.36]  that's pretty cool.
[5418.36 --> 5420.98]  I was hoping I was going to be able to give some away at PAX East,
[5421.10 --> 5422.84]  but they didn't come quite fast enough.
[5423.16 --> 5423.38]  Yeah,
[5423.38 --> 5423.98]  that's a bummer.
[5423.98 --> 5424.66]  Um,
[5424.66 --> 5426.50]  we have a new shirt design coming.
[5427.26 --> 5427.66]  Um,
[5427.70 --> 5428.38]  like one of the,
[5428.44 --> 5431.18]  one of the ongoing jokes here for,
[5431.42 --> 5431.74]  um,
[5432.02 --> 5433.76]  let me see if I can find it.
[5433.86 --> 5438.04]  One of the ongoing jokes here at Linus media group is we don't sleep and sleep is for,
[5438.14 --> 5438.34]  uh,
[5438.34 --> 5439.40]  sleep is for wusses.
[5439.78 --> 5440.04]  Cause should,
[5440.24 --> 5440.48]  what do you,
[5440.52 --> 5441.04]  what do you think Luke?
[5441.08 --> 5441.92]  Should I tease the artwork?
[5442.00 --> 5443.04]  Cause I think it's amazing.
[5444.04 --> 5444.40]  Sure.
[5444.52 --> 5444.66]  Yeah,
[5444.68 --> 5444.82]  no,
[5444.82 --> 5445.20]  that's cool.
[5445.20 --> 5445.68]  Okay.
[5445.74 --> 5446.72]  I'm going to see if I can,
[5446.86 --> 5448.18]  I think,
[5448.32 --> 5450.60]  I think Nick messaged it to me.
[5451.72 --> 5452.16]  Um,
[5453.44 --> 5453.92]  bah,
[5454.12 --> 5454.94]  I'm really frustrated.
[5455.06 --> 5456.04]  I can't find it.
[5457.08 --> 5457.52]  Oh,
[5457.66 --> 5458.28]  the problem is I,
[5458.28 --> 5460.48]  I talked to Nick way too much.
[5462.24 --> 5462.60]  He,
[5462.68 --> 5463.70]  he would have used push,
[5463.78 --> 5464.00]  right?
[5467.12 --> 5467.44]  Probably,
[5467.80 --> 5469.30]  but it might not have been sent to him.
[5469.52 --> 5471.86]  It might've been sent to him through some form of hosting.
[5471.86 --> 5473.98]  Um,
[5474.62 --> 5474.92]  Oh,
[5475.10 --> 5475.60]  balls.
[5477.44 --> 5477.98]  Let me see.
[5478.02 --> 5478.66]  I'll see if I can find it.
[5478.66 --> 5478.86]  Anyway,
[5478.92 --> 5479.46]  in the meantime,
[5479.70 --> 5481.06]  I'll do another rapid fire thing.
[5481.12 --> 5481.30]  If you,
[5481.36 --> 5482.30]  if you want to look for it,
[5482.68 --> 5483.16]  then I'll,
[5483.16 --> 5483.36]  uh,
[5483.36 --> 5484.40]  I'll do that right now.
[5484.72 --> 5485.00]  Okay.
[5485.12 --> 5486.26]  Google is apparently,
[5486.46 --> 5486.96]  uh,
[5487.00 --> 5488.72]  headlines a little bit misleading here.
[5488.82 --> 5489.00]  Uh,
[5489.00 --> 5490.32]  this was posted by Victoria's secret.
[5490.46 --> 5491.20]  I'll go ahead and I'll,
[5491.26 --> 5493.04]  I'll do the post if you're looking for this then.
[5493.46 --> 5493.68]  Yep.
[5493.72 --> 5493.98]  Okay.
[5494.12 --> 5494.54]  Sounds good.
[5494.68 --> 5494.92]  Okay.
[5495.00 --> 5500.18]  So Google is apparently working on a technology or at least has published a paper about a technology
[5500.18 --> 5506.22]  that would allow it to tell whether facts on the internet are actually true.
[5506.38 --> 5510.34]  And this is a hundred percent theoretical now,
[5510.34 --> 5516.64]  but could be both amazing and absolutely terrifying in the future.
[5516.76 --> 5520.48]  So we'll go ahead and pull up the article on new scientist.com.
[5520.60 --> 5521.08]  Uh,
[5521.14 --> 5521.62]  but the,
[5521.70 --> 5522.16]  and again,
[5522.26 --> 5522.72]  all these,
[5522.84 --> 5524.54]  all these are so sensationalist.
[5524.64 --> 5527.00]  Google wants to rank websites based on facts,
[5527.16 --> 5529.32]  not links or traffic or popularity.
[5529.32 --> 5529.54]  Well,
[5529.62 --> 5530.06]  hold on,
[5530.18 --> 5531.16]  hold on a second.
[5531.44 --> 5532.10]  They haven't,
[5532.62 --> 5533.68]  they haven't said that,
[5533.96 --> 5537.28]  but what they're trying to figure out is how to make,
[5537.62 --> 5539.30]  how to check a website's,
[5539.30 --> 5539.80]  um,
[5541.16 --> 5544.74]  general accuracy by taking facts that they know,
[5544.86 --> 5547.74]  like Linus Sebastian's birthday is August 20th.
[5547.74 --> 5549.94]  If that was posted on that website,
[5550.08 --> 5551.34]  then that would be like,
[5551.38 --> 5551.82]  like a,
[5551.82 --> 5553.48]  like a veracity score.
[5553.60 --> 5554.92]  Like that would be a truth score.
[5555.14 --> 5558.90]  And then the higher a website's or webpages truth score,
[5558.90 --> 5561.40]  the higher it would be ranked because the better,
[5561.40 --> 5565.08]  the likelihood that the other information on it is true.
[5565.08 --> 5569.24]  And that seems to be how they are planning to have this work.
[5569.24 --> 5571.66]  And this is incredibly cool.
[5571.98 --> 5572.12]  I mean,
[5572.12 --> 5572.82]  there's a couple of,
[5572.88 --> 5573.02]  so,
[5573.12 --> 5573.48]  you know,
[5573.54 --> 5577.92]  sites like the onion are probably going to have a much harder time getting good search rankings because,
[5578.06 --> 5578.62]  you know,
[5578.62 --> 5579.38]  a lot of that,
[5579.56 --> 5583.40]  a lot of that traffic still comes from people who don't know that the onion is nonsense.
[5583.74 --> 5583.80]  Yeah.
[5584.16 --> 5584.56]  Um,
[5584.56 --> 5588.16]  and so when something goes hyper viral and it's a fake news story,
[5588.16 --> 5588.98]  it's going to,
[5589.06 --> 5590.58]  it's going to hurt sort of that business,
[5590.58 --> 5590.94]  I guess,
[5591.02 --> 5591.22]  but,
[5591.26 --> 5591.76]  oh,
[5591.80 --> 5591.96]  well,
[5592.08 --> 5592.82]  I suppose.
[5593.26 --> 5593.68]  Um,
[5593.74 --> 5598.88]  but the bigger thing to me is this could hurt.
[5599.70 --> 5600.18]  Um,
[5601.38 --> 5602.46]  and I don't want to,
[5602.54 --> 5605.96]  I don't want this to turn into a religious debate.
[5606.14 --> 5606.52]  Okay.
[5606.52 --> 5608.16]  That's not the objective here.
[5608.26 --> 5608.38]  Yeah.
[5608.42 --> 5608.56]  I'm,
[5608.56 --> 5609.54]  I'm going there with this.
[5609.80 --> 5610.06]  Um,
[5610.06 --> 5613.86]  so if a site had information on it,
[5613.86 --> 5615.84]  that was clearly factually inaccurate,
[5615.84 --> 5618.20]  like dinosaurs never existed,
[5618.20 --> 5619.20]  for example,
[5619.64 --> 5620.20]  Oh geez,
[5620.30 --> 5628.36]  it would allow Google to bury other information on the site and present it as not fact.
[5628.60 --> 5636.00]  And it would take information from sites that contain facts like that dinosaurs existed.
[5636.52 --> 5640.34]  And it would take those articles and call them fact.
[5640.60 --> 5641.62]  And I'm not going to,
[5641.74 --> 5643.34]  I'm not weighing in on this debate.
[5643.48 --> 5645.12]  I'm not getting involved in this,
[5645.76 --> 5646.96]  but just kind of did.
[5647.06 --> 5647.14]  No,
[5647.20 --> 5647.26]  no,
[5647.26 --> 5649.32]  I'm not going to say where I stand on it.
[5649.38 --> 5655.22]  But what I'm going to say is that it could create a situation where the beliefs of people,
[5655.60 --> 5656.14]  whether,
[5656.30 --> 5656.64]  you know,
[5656.66 --> 5656.86]  where,
[5656.94 --> 5658.64]  where something is hotly debated.
[5658.64 --> 5659.12]  Okay.
[5659.56 --> 5666.22]  Where the beliefs of people could be undermined by Google sorting based on the facts.
[5666.22 --> 5668.34]  Google sorting might ignore those things though,
[5668.62 --> 5670.36]  might manually ignore those things.
[5670.52 --> 5671.96]  Do you think it will?
[5672.84 --> 5674.60]  Because there's interesting stuff.
[5674.74 --> 5675.08]  I,
[5675.14 --> 5676.50]  I don't know if it will or not.
[5676.58 --> 5677.16]  I doubt it.
[5677.28 --> 5677.94]  Come on,
[5678.02 --> 5678.16]  man.
[5678.94 --> 5679.40]  Well,
[5679.54 --> 5679.96]  I don't know.
[5680.06 --> 5684.44]  Filtering for religious stuff might be a really good PR move for Google to do.
[5684.44 --> 5687.22]  And is actually fairly understandable.
[5688.22 --> 5691.12]  But another thing that could be kind of an issue is rumors.
[5691.80 --> 5692.24]  Yeah.
[5692.38 --> 5693.22]  Rumor mill websites.
[5693.22 --> 5695.14]  There's a lot of really big rumor mill websites.
[5695.34 --> 5698.86]  WCCF tech is largely rumor mill stuff for graphics cards.
[5699.26 --> 5699.36]  Yep.
[5700.76 --> 5702.14]  What happens with rumors?
[5702.36 --> 5703.26]  Are those facts?
[5704.50 --> 5705.02]  No.
[5705.32 --> 5705.54]  No,
[5705.54 --> 5706.36]  but are they lies?
[5707.34 --> 5707.82]  No,
[5708.14 --> 5708.90]  not really.
[5709.20 --> 5710.14]  They're not fake necessarily.
[5710.68 --> 5711.10]  So there's,
[5711.22 --> 5711.50]  not really.
[5711.62 --> 5712.72]  This raises up,
[5712.86 --> 5713.00]  this,
[5713.10 --> 5713.96]  this is like,
[5713.96 --> 5716.52]  we're going to have kettles of fish to boil for,
[5716.62 --> 5718.06]  for weeks on weeks on weeks.
[5718.46 --> 5718.64]  Yeah.
[5718.94 --> 5719.58]  When we,
[5719.78 --> 5719.92]  when,
[5720.06 --> 5724.16]  when and if they decide to start implementing something like this.
[5725.04 --> 5725.82]  So I,
[5725.90 --> 5727.94]  I'll be very interested to like,
[5728.06 --> 5729.04]  oh man,
[5729.18 --> 5731.44]  like there's so many good things that can come of it.
[5731.72 --> 5731.98]  You know,
[5731.98 --> 5734.64]  like are carrots bad for you?
[5734.84 --> 5736.08]  If Google could just,
[5736.20 --> 5741.36]  if Google could just destroy the search rankings of anyone that says carrots are bad for you,
[5741.36 --> 5745.34]  or is oxygenated water going to help you perform better at sports?
[5745.34 --> 5746.68]  Could help for,
[5746.68 --> 5747.30]  um,
[5747.42 --> 5747.70]  yeah,
[5747.90 --> 5749.72]  like basically what you're saying,
[5749.88 --> 5752.28]  but more specifically just medical things in general,
[5752.40 --> 5755.72]  because there's so much medical hubbub of all over the internet.
[5756.10 --> 5756.44]  Yes.
[5756.46 --> 5756.82]  It's,
[5756.88 --> 5757.24]  it's,
[5757.30 --> 5758.08]  it's crazy.
[5758.08 --> 5763.08]  So if they could help people and apparently they've looked into working with the Mayo Clinic already.
[5763.42 --> 5763.64]  Okay.
[5763.64 --> 5766.34]  So like health stuff is a big deal.
[5766.34 --> 5766.76]  Uh,
[5766.76 --> 5767.04]  like they,
[5767.10 --> 5767.28]  no,
[5767.32 --> 5769.84]  I think they've actually worked with the Mayo Clinic on certain things.
[5770.42 --> 5770.86]  Um,
[5771.32 --> 5772.08]  so like,
[5772.08 --> 5774.26]  like health information is going to be like a,
[5774.26 --> 5774.90]  a really,
[5775.00 --> 5777.04]  really huge part of this.
[5777.04 --> 5777.72]  Like if,
[5778.02 --> 5778.42]  cause you know,
[5778.54 --> 5778.98]  you know,
[5779.08 --> 5781.04]  those businesses that are structured,
[5781.20 --> 5792.60]  like create a complete BS product and then create an entire network of websites about reviewing that product and giving it positive reviews and fake testimonials so that it clutters up the search results.
[5794.04 --> 5797.30]  That is what this needs to destroy.
[5797.92 --> 5797.94]  Well,
[5798.12 --> 5798.38]  like,
[5798.62 --> 5799.16]  yeah,
[5799.52 --> 5803.34]  it would be nice if Google could start hunting out.
[5803.44 --> 5803.60]  No,
[5803.76 --> 5805.34]  Google probably won't do this,
[5805.34 --> 5807.44]  but it would be nice if I guess Amazon could do it,
[5807.46 --> 5809.24]  but I actually don't even think Amazon will do it,
[5809.26 --> 5810.64]  but hunting out fake reviews,
[5811.16 --> 5813.22]  because that's going to be a really big issue.
[5813.36 --> 5813.58]  Yeah.
[5813.70 --> 5814.34]  Big problem.
[5814.84 --> 5817.02]  Huge percentages of reviews are Faco.
[5817.68 --> 5818.08]  Yep.
[5818.54 --> 5819.50]  Which is not,
[5819.52 --> 5821.36]  not cool at all.
[5821.76 --> 5821.94]  Well,
[5821.98 --> 5823.12]  I think that's pretty much it.
[5823.24 --> 5823.46]  Uh,
[5823.46 --> 5823.68]  we're,
[5823.82 --> 5825.90]  we're an hour and a half in here and,
[5826.08 --> 5826.38]  uh,
[5826.64 --> 5827.24]  it's been a,
[5827.28 --> 5829.22]  it's been a great show and we've enjoyed it very,
[5829.32 --> 5829.92]  very much Lee.
[5830.16 --> 5831.02]  And I think,
[5831.08 --> 5831.26]  uh,
[5831.26 --> 5831.64]  we will,
[5831.82 --> 5832.88]  we will see you guys.
[5833.06 --> 5833.38]  Uh,
[5833.44 --> 5834.54]  we'll see you guys next week.
[5834.62 --> 5835.30]  Same bad times,
[5835.34 --> 5836.14]  same bad channel.
[5836.38 --> 5836.64]  Um,
[5836.88 --> 5837.88]  did you have anything to add?
[5837.94 --> 5838.18]  I mean,
[5838.24 --> 5839.34]  are you,
[5839.42 --> 5840.92]  are you looking forward to the rest of the show?
[5842.22 --> 5842.62]  Yeah.
[5843.00 --> 5843.44]  Um,
[5843.52 --> 5845.34]  I said this a little bit earlier,
[5845.34 --> 5846.52]  which was kind of,
[5846.64 --> 5846.78]  we,
[5846.86 --> 5847.06]  we,
[5847.12 --> 5848.38]  we missed the boat a little bit.
[5848.44 --> 5848.56]  We,
[5848.62 --> 5850.04]  we went to the wrong parade.
[5850.66 --> 5851.02]  Um,
[5851.10 --> 5852.38]  GDC was where all the,
[5852.38 --> 5853.48]  the fun ended up being.
[5853.80 --> 5857.84]  Apparently a lot of computer hardware vendors actually bailed out last minute.
[5857.84 --> 5858.84]  Um,
[5858.84 --> 5861.10]  so like,
[5861.10 --> 5862.68]  like Nvidia was supposed to be here.
[5863.06 --> 5863.42]  Right.
[5863.60 --> 5863.78]  Yeah.
[5863.78 --> 5864.14]  They're always,
[5864.22 --> 5864.72]  and then,
[5864.72 --> 5865.66]  yeah.
[5865.70 --> 5866.90]  And then not that long ago,
[5866.90 --> 5869.06]  they bailed out because they did their launch at GDC,
[5869.22 --> 5869.40]  right?
[5869.42 --> 5873.08]  They did their launch at GDC and they have their own event coming in like two
[5873.08 --> 5873.36]  weeks.
[5874.14 --> 5874.54]  Yeah.
[5874.84 --> 5878.56]  So like a lot of different hardware vendors actually didn't end up showing up.
[5878.68 --> 5880.14]  So I was pretty worried.
[5880.14 --> 5881.46]  Like at one point in time today,
[5881.46 --> 5883.78]  I was legitimately going through and being like,
[5883.96 --> 5884.54]  we are screwed.
[5884.96 --> 5887.68]  We're not going to get half of the videos that we need.
[5888.18 --> 5888.62]  Um,
[5888.62 --> 5890.86]  and then someone pointed me out into this,
[5890.96 --> 5891.10]  like,
[5891.18 --> 5892.58]  what is that noise?
[5892.72 --> 5892.92]  Sorry.
[5892.96 --> 5894.68]  I'm playing with the thing from the loop.
[5894.78 --> 5894.94]  Oh,
[5895.04 --> 5895.32]  geez.
[5895.84 --> 5896.32]  Um,
[5896.46 --> 5897.10]  one of that,
[5897.10 --> 5897.94]  that sounded horrible.
[5898.18 --> 5898.60]  Uh,
[5899.08 --> 5903.98]  one of the people that I met up with pointed me out to this like corner that
[5903.98 --> 5907.54]  was hidden behind the Twitch booth and like spots,
[5907.54 --> 5909.18]  what tech benches is there.
[5909.70 --> 5910.14]  Um,
[5910.38 --> 5910.78]  I know,
[5910.92 --> 5911.22]  I know.
[5911.22 --> 5911.62]  He,
[5911.62 --> 5911.66]  he,
[5911.66 --> 5913.90]  he's in partnership with EK water blocks.
[5914.10 --> 5914.58]  They,
[5914.66 --> 5916.40]  they like have one booth together.
[5916.52 --> 5916.78]  Nice.
[5916.86 --> 5917.06]  Uh,
[5917.06 --> 5918.12]  EVGA is there.
[5918.24 --> 5919.16]  Enter max is there.
[5919.24 --> 5919.94]  They don't have anything new,
[5920.02 --> 5920.64]  but they're there.
[5921.06 --> 5921.50]  Um,
[5921.60 --> 5922.48]  PNY is there.
[5922.48 --> 5922.66]  Like,
[5922.68 --> 5923.14]  like that's,
[5923.14 --> 5923.36]  it's,
[5923.36 --> 5923.38]  it's,
[5923.38 --> 5924.34]  it's where all like the,
[5924.74 --> 5927.02]  all like the little tech companies kind of huddled together.
[5928.26 --> 5928.78]  Yeah.
[5928.86 --> 5930.20]  So we're going to make it,
[5930.24 --> 5930.66]  but like,
[5931.12 --> 5931.34]  yes,
[5931.50 --> 5931.84]  put a,
[5931.84 --> 5933.18]  put a two 90 X in the middle.
[5933.78 --> 5934.30]  Yeah.
[5934.54 --> 5934.78]  It,
[5934.78 --> 5935.06]  it,
[5935.06 --> 5935.34]  it,
[5935.34 --> 5936.08]  it was,
[5936.14 --> 5937.20]  and is close.
[5937.28 --> 5941.12]  I think there's like exactly enough stuff for us to make exactly,
[5941.12 --> 5943.14]  the amount of videos that we need to make.
[5943.38 --> 5943.64]  Nice.
[5943.64 --> 5945.60]  But like there should have been an abundance,
[5945.60 --> 5947.00]  but then GDC was crazy.
[5947.32 --> 5949.24]  One of the reasons why is,
[5949.24 --> 5950.12]  um,
[5950.66 --> 5952.52]  PAX East was only 11 months ago.
[5953.24 --> 5955.30]  It should have been 12 months ago.
[5955.42 --> 5955.66]  Oh,
[5955.70 --> 5956.06]  interesting.
[5956.48 --> 5957.74]  It wasn't a year ago.
[5957.90 --> 5958.38]  Um,
[5958.42 --> 5958.62]  they,
[5958.70 --> 5961.68]  they moved it because it was on spring break or something before,
[5961.68 --> 5962.46]  um,
[5962.46 --> 5963.22]  or maybe,
[5963.22 --> 5965.96]  maybe it wasn't exactly a month difference or something like that.
[5965.96 --> 5966.74]  So it,
[5966.74 --> 5971.70]  it brought it much closer to GDC and it brought it closer to CES.
[5971.86 --> 5974.18]  So it's harder for hardware companies,
[5974.18 --> 5976.42]  which are going to have bigger development times to be able to actually have
[5976.42 --> 5976.82]  something.
[5976.82 --> 5977.24]  Right.
[5977.24 --> 5982.98]  And a lot of the gaming guys are pulling their hair out because they flew
[5982.98 --> 5985.94]  directly from GDC to PAX East and are hosting again,
[5986.54 --> 5988.12]  which is crazy.
[5989.00 --> 5989.20]  Yeah.
[5989.32 --> 5993.20]  Like there's a lot of those booth guys that haven't had a break.
[5993.20 --> 5994.22]  they,
[5994.32 --> 5995.16]  they hosted GDC,
[5995.46 --> 5996.10]  they flew,
[5996.34 --> 5996.92]  they set up,
[5997.04 --> 6000.56]  they hosted PAX East like absolutely nuts.
[6000.60 --> 6002.06]  So it's a pretty crazy timing.
[6002.44 --> 6002.62]  Yeah.
[6004.06 --> 6004.66]  But yeah,
[6004.66 --> 6005.52]  there's some cool stuff.
[6005.80 --> 6008.60]  There's a hardware company that I didn't even know existed.
[6008.98 --> 6009.82]  They're very,
[6009.94 --> 6010.52]  very new.
[6011.20 --> 6011.58]  Um,
[6011.58 --> 6013.68]  I think they were founded in 2014.
[6014.24 --> 6018.66]  They're a Korean company that makes Ram and it's easily some of the best
[6018.66 --> 6019.60]  Ram that I've ever seen.
[6019.60 --> 6022.80]  And like every single one of their different kits are some of the best Ram
[6022.80 --> 6024.74]  I've ever seen in terms of like aesthetics.
[6024.96 --> 6025.36]  Right.
[6025.50 --> 6026.78]  Cause Ram's Ram at this point.
[6027.36 --> 6027.60]  Yes.
[6027.78 --> 6028.34]  Um,
[6028.62 --> 6029.02]  so yeah,
[6029.02 --> 6029.76]  we're going to be,
[6029.88 --> 6030.76]  we'll have a video from them,
[6030.88 --> 6031.60]  which will be pretty cool.
[6032.10 --> 6032.82]  All right.
[6032.92 --> 6033.20]  Well,
[6033.30 --> 6036.16]  we will see you guys next week and,
[6036.24 --> 6036.44]  uh,
[6036.44 --> 6038.38]  thank you very much for tuning in.
[6038.58 --> 6038.88]  And,
[6038.96 --> 6039.16]  uh,
[6039.16 --> 6040.42]  for those of you who missed it,
[6040.48 --> 6042.16]  the archive will be going up sometime tonight.
[6042.32 --> 6043.82]  I've got badminton tonight though.
[6043.88 --> 6045.80]  So it'll be probably a little bit on the later side,
[6045.86 --> 6049.58]  especially because I have to stitch together two chunks of show because,
[6049.58 --> 6050.46]  uh,
[6050.60 --> 6050.92]  because,
[6051.12 --> 6051.26]  uh,
[6051.74 --> 6052.26]  magic.
[6052.80 --> 6053.48]  All right.
[6053.72 --> 6054.26]  Peace out.
[6055.32 --> 6055.76]  Yep.
[6056.02 --> 6056.46]  Uh,
[6056.86 --> 6057.98]  you gotta do the outro thing.
[6058.06 --> 6058.50]  I'm doing it.
[6058.80 --> 6059.42]  I got this.
[6059.54 --> 6059.70]  All right.
[6060.12 --> 6060.46]  Yeah.
[6061.50 --> 6061.78]  Okay.
[6063.12 --> 6063.60]  Well,
[6063.60 --> 6063.96]  actually,
[6064.14 --> 6064.44]  uh,
[6064.44 --> 6067.32]  we did not bad this week considering that,
[6067.32 --> 6067.78]  um,
[6068.14 --> 6070.54]  we only had one and a half hosts.
[6071.54 --> 6071.98]  Um,
[6071.98 --> 6075.72]  and the stream died at the beginning.
[6076.16 --> 6076.66]  Oh,
[6076.68 --> 6076.80]  right.
[6077.02 --> 6077.46]  Sponsors.
[6077.46 --> 6079.14]  Linda.com.
[6081.50 --> 6081.86]  Pax East.
[6082.80 --> 6083.28]  Loot crate.
[6084.10 --> 6085.46]  Linda.com slash packs.
[6086.24 --> 6086.64]  What?
[6086.74 --> 6087.22]  What is that?
[6087.98 --> 6090.46]  That's the Linda.com URL for the pack sponsorship.
[6091.18 --> 6091.52]  Oh,
[6091.74 --> 6091.94]  Oh,
[6092.04 --> 6092.70]  that's right.
[6092.76 --> 6094.54]  They sponsored packs like at the last second,
[6094.60 --> 6094.88]  didn't they?
[6095.44 --> 6095.74]  Yep.
[6095.92 --> 6096.38]  That's cool.
[6096.38 --> 6098.14]  I didn't even have a URL all of today.
[6098.36 --> 6100.68]  So I was guessing it and I was wrong.
[6101.38 --> 6102.84]  I did Linda.com slash Linus.
[6102.94 --> 6103.52]  And then they were like,
[6103.62 --> 6103.82]  Nope.
[6103.92 --> 6105.00]  Linda.com slash packs.
[6105.20 --> 6105.40]  Oh,
[6105.56 --> 6106.92]  so we're going to fix that in post.
[6107.08 --> 6107.96]  Luckily I was like,
[6108.04 --> 6111.44]  there might be a corrected one down here every single time that I did it.
[6111.52 --> 6112.82]  So we're just going to put the corrected one there.
[6113.42 --> 6113.78]  Wow.
[6114.44 --> 6114.88]  All right.
[6115.38 --> 6115.82]  All right.
[6115.86 --> 6116.06]  Later.
[6117.04 --> 6117.44]  Bye.
[6117.66 --> 6118.24]  Oh guys.
[6118.34 --> 6118.70]  Sorry.
[6118.78 --> 6119.76]  No after party today.
[6119.78 --> 6120.50]  I got to go to badminton.
