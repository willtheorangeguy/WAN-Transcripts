[0.00 --> 6.00]  Hello! Hi! And welcome to the WAN Show! Hi! This is Linus, I'm Luke. Nice to meet you guys.
[6.00 --> 12.00]  I know this is the first time we have ever met, but you know, it's good to make...
[12.00 --> 22.00]  You're gonna meet a lot of new people in the Christmas season. Sometimes it's newborns, sometimes it's a new, like, friend of, you know, friend of someone in the family that's coming to the green...
[22.00 --> 24.00]  I didn't need my laptop.
[24.00 --> 34.00]  But that's fine. I know you guys don't know us, but what we're gonna do is we're gonna recap everything that happened this year so that you guys can get to know us.
[34.00 --> 39.00]  Everything? Everything. Everything. Not everything. Okay. Not everything at all.
[39.00 --> 44.00]  We're gonna recap the fun things, or the terrible things, or the important things in general that happened this year.
[44.00 --> 52.00]  And I'm gonna drop that thing for now. I'm going to stay with you guys throughout the show, and we're gonna cycle through Linus Media Group members,
[52.00 --> 62.00]  and they're gonna talk about all the important things that they did this year. Things I thought was super dope, things I thought was super crap, things that were hard, things that were easy, whatever.
[62.00 --> 66.00]  Okay. Yeah. I think that's a show. So...
[66.00 --> 68.00]  Oh, yeah. We're... Yeah. Start.
[68.00 --> 70.00]  Oh my god.
[70.00 --> 92.00]  We haven't been done!
[92.00 --> 94.00]  We haven't been done!
[94.00 --> 96.00]  We haven't been done!
[96.00 --> 98.00]  We haven't been done!
[98.00 --> 100.00]  Dollar Shave Club!
[100.00 --> 102.00]  Clean up for your family that you're gonna go visit on Christmas, man.
[102.00 --> 104.00]  Yeah, you should probably do that.
[104.00 --> 106.00]  I should... I mean, yeah. I need to get a haircut, too.
[106.00 --> 108.00]  I need to go do, like, both those things.
[108.00 --> 109.00]  I got a haircut.
[109.00 --> 111.00]  Those places are probably closed.
[111.00 --> 112.00]  Probably.
[112.00 --> 113.00]  Whatever.
[113.00 --> 115.00]  Yeah, I went to our hairdressers and they were like, where's your friend?
[115.00 --> 116.00]  Oh, yeah.
[116.00 --> 117.00]  And I was like, oh.
[117.00 --> 118.00]  His hair is really long now.
[118.00 --> 120.00]  Yeah. His hair is really long.
[120.00 --> 123.00]  Anyways, so what was the... I think I know this answer.
[123.00 --> 126.00]  What was the worst thing that happened this year for you?
[126.00 --> 127.00]  I think I know this answer.
[127.00 --> 128.00]  You do?
[128.00 --> 129.00]  I think so.
[129.00 --> 131.00]  I can say what I think it is.
[131.00 --> 132.00]  Yeah.
[132.00 --> 133.00]  The prank.
[133.00 --> 134.00]  Which one?
[134.00 --> 136.00]  The office robbery prank.
[136.00 --> 138.00]  I mean, okay.
[138.00 --> 142.00]  That wasn't even that bad because we had...
[142.00 --> 148.00]  Like, I was just disheartened from that because the night before...
[148.00 --> 149.00]  Oh, the titles were...
[149.00 --> 150.00]  Oh, goodness.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Okay, where do we change that?
[152.00 --> 153.00]  I'm not logged in as...
[153.00 --> 155.00]  One sec, one sec.
[155.00 --> 156.00]  Brutal!
[156.00 --> 158.00]  We'll change the title.
[158.00 --> 163.00]  Anyways, so people that don't know about the office robbery prank, it was on channel Super Fun.
[163.00 --> 172.00]  The first prank that happened was a bunch of guys in the office pranked Linus to try to make him think that he was going to miss a really important flight.
[172.00 --> 173.00]  And it was horrible.
[173.00 --> 176.00]  So Linus and I...
[176.00 --> 177.00]  Mainly Linus.
[177.00 --> 178.00]  Definitely mainly Linus.
[178.00 --> 183.00]  But Linus and I got everyone back by making people think that the office had been robbed.
[183.00 --> 187.00]  And then that turned into us.
[187.00 --> 188.00]  What?
[188.00 --> 190.00]  Are we creative?
[190.00 --> 192.00]  I think we're a talk show.
[192.00 --> 193.00]  Okay.
[193.00 --> 195.00]  Okay.
[195.00 --> 196.00]  Okay.
[196.00 --> 197.00]  Okay.
[197.00 --> 198.00]  Okay.
[198.00 --> 199.00]  Okay.
[199.00 --> 200.00]  Okay.
[200.00 --> 201.00]  Okay.
[201.00 --> 202.00]  Okay.
[202.00 --> 203.00]  Yeah.
[203.00 --> 204.00]  So, yeah.
[204.00 --> 205.00]  People freaked out.
[205.00 --> 206.00]  And, yeah.
[206.00 --> 208.00]  Anyways, now you're up.
[208.00 --> 214.00]  We had released the, like, here's our crazy new security system thing the night before.
[214.00 --> 218.00]  And in the beginning of that, Linus was like, our old one was laughable.
[218.00 --> 219.00]  It's terrible.
[219.00 --> 221.00]  Like, blah, blah, blah.
[221.00 --> 225.00]  And then I think we had, like, a work function that night.
[225.00 --> 226.00]  And I went to him.
[226.00 --> 227.00]  I, like, brought him aside.
[227.00 --> 229.00]  I was like, I think this is a really bad idea.
[229.00 --> 233.00]  Like, there's still going to be, like, a number of days before we move out.
[233.00 --> 236.00]  Like, and then, uh.
[236.00 --> 239.00]  And, like, some people did know our address for sure at that point.
[239.00 --> 240.00]  Yeah.
[240.00 --> 244.00]  But then we went in the next day and everything was ransacked and robbed.
[244.00 --> 245.00]  And I was.
[245.00 --> 249.00]  One of my favorite parts in the video is, like, everyone's running around screaming,
[249.00 --> 250.00]  freaking out.
[250.00 --> 253.00]  And then Nick's in his office just like, oh.
[253.00 --> 254.00]  Yeah.
[254.00 --> 258.00]  Because everyone was, like, high level of, like, anger.
[258.00 --> 260.00]  Burkle basically killed someone.
[260.00 --> 262.00]  Like, people were freaking out.
[262.00 --> 265.00]  And then Nick is just like, I'm depressed.
[265.00 --> 268.00]  I was like, I tried to stop this.
[268.00 --> 269.00]  Yeah.
[269.00 --> 270.00]  I tried.
[270.00 --> 271.00]  I tried.
[271.00 --> 272.00]  I did everything I could.
[272.00 --> 273.00]  So.
[273.00 --> 275.00]  So what other important stuff happened?
[275.00 --> 276.00]  I don't know.
[276.00 --> 281.00]  Like, there's so much stuff that on my side that I can't really, like, talk about.
[281.00 --> 282.00]  Right.
[282.00 --> 283.00]  Which is the tough part.
[283.00 --> 284.00]  Yeah.
[284.00 --> 285.00]  But, like.
[285.00 --> 286.00]  That's fair.
[286.00 --> 288.00]  Just getting collaborations on a lot of really big videos was probably a really important
[288.00 --> 289.00]  part.
[289.00 --> 290.00]  Yeah.
[290.00 --> 291.00]  Yeah.
[291.00 --> 292.00]  I mean, there's one CPU with Cooler Master.
[292.00 --> 293.00]  Yeah.
[293.00 --> 294.00]  Um.
[294.00 --> 296.00]  There's that thing that's coming out in under 12 hours.
[296.00 --> 297.00]  Yeah.
[297.00 --> 298.00]  The thing.
[298.00 --> 299.00]  That was really largely headed up by you.
[299.00 --> 305.00]  Well, when the people on YouTube see it, it will have come out 24 hours ago.
[305.00 --> 310.00]  So go see the last release on the channel if you want to know what we're talking about.
[310.00 --> 311.00]  Oh!
[311.00 --> 312.00]  Good point.
[312.00 --> 314.00]  But these people, it's a, the live viewers, it's a teaser.
[314.00 --> 315.00]  Yeah.
[315.00 --> 316.00]  So it's a thing.
[316.00 --> 319.00]  It's a thing and it's colorful and it's really interesting.
[319.00 --> 324.00]  I think Ed posted a teaser of like the intro screen on his Twitter.
[324.00 --> 325.00]  Maybe?
[325.00 --> 326.00]  That makes sense.
[326.00 --> 328.00]  It said something like Merry Christmas or something like that.
[328.00 --> 329.00]  I think that's Ed Yago.
[329.00 --> 330.00]  At Ed Zilly Yago.
[330.00 --> 331.00]  Ed Zilly Yago.
[331.00 --> 332.00]  Ed Yago.
[332.00 --> 333.00]  Ed Zilly Yago.
[333.00 --> 334.00]  One of those.
[334.00 --> 335.00]  But yeah, stuff like that.
[335.00 --> 336.00]  Um.
[336.00 --> 338.00]  I was getting like D Brand on Scrapyard Wars.
[338.00 --> 339.00]  D Brand or.
[339.00 --> 341.00]  Some guys are like, what the hell have you guys done?
[341.00 --> 342.00]  You're 27 hours early.
[342.00 --> 343.00]  Yeah.
[343.00 --> 344.00]  Yeah.
[344.00 --> 345.00]  It's more as Christmas, dude.
[345.00 --> 346.00]  Yeah.
[346.00 --> 347.00]  D Brand on Scrapyard Wars was sick.
[347.00 --> 348.00]  D Brand's awesome.
[348.00 --> 350.00]  Scrapyard Wars also awesome.
[350.00 --> 351.00]  D Brand.
[351.00 --> 352.00]  Awesome.
[352.00 --> 353.00]  D Brand.
[353.00 --> 356.00]  My phone like blew up in my pocket.
[356.00 --> 357.00]  So now I have a new one, I guess.
[357.00 --> 358.00]  Yeah.
[358.00 --> 359.00]  You got the Z5 Premium.
[359.00 --> 360.00]  Z5 Premium.
[360.00 --> 361.00]  Um.
[361.00 --> 363.00]  I'm trying to think of what the other like really important.
[363.00 --> 364.00]  Ultra Ride Festival.
[364.00 --> 366.00]  Ultra Ride Festival was really, really cool.
[366.00 --> 375.00]  If you guys want to see Rylan, our winner's actual setup, go over to Linus's Twitter.
[375.00 --> 376.00]  Uh.
[376.00 --> 379.00]  Cause I actually just shared Rylan's video from Linus's Twitter.
[379.00 --> 380.00]  Um.
[380.00 --> 381.00]  It's really cool.
[381.00 --> 382.00]  Lots of good stuff.
[382.00 --> 383.00]  You guys probably already saw the build.
[383.00 --> 384.00]  Yeah.
[384.00 --> 389.00]  Which is insane with the, uh, the best SLI setup ever.
[389.00 --> 395.00]  That was honestly one of my favorite moments of the year was watching Linus's face as he's
[395.00 --> 398.00]  just like, you shouldn't buy the blah, blah, blah.
[398.00 --> 399.00]  It's stupid.
[399.00 --> 400.00]  And then he just looks down.
[400.00 --> 401.00]  He's like.
[401.00 --> 405.00]  And he's literally speechless for like five seconds.
[405.00 --> 409.00]  And he's like, no, no.
[409.00 --> 414.00]  It was just, it was such a genuine moment.
[414.00 --> 415.00]  Um.
[415.00 --> 416.00]  So brutal.
[416.00 --> 417.00]  I actually quite enjoyed that.
[417.00 --> 418.00]  What about you, man?
[418.00 --> 420.00]  Like what were your favorite projects of the year?
[420.00 --> 421.00]  Uh.
[421.00 --> 422.00]  The bomb.
[422.00 --> 423.00]  The bomb.
[423.00 --> 424.00]  Like hands down.
[424.00 --> 425.00]  Yeah.
[425.00 --> 427.00]  The fallout bomb was by far my favorite project.
[427.00 --> 428.00]  Um.
[428.00 --> 429.00]  That made me super excited.
[429.00 --> 435.00]  One thing that I've talked about fairly publicly is that while I and everyone probably watching
[435.00 --> 441.00]  and some of the people that work here, not necessarily everyone, uh, I love computer hardware.
[441.00 --> 442.00]  It's great.
[442.00 --> 447.00]  But it's kinda got a little slow in the last year or two.
[447.00 --> 448.00]  Um.
[448.00 --> 450.00]  Things are really predictable.
[450.00 --> 452.00]  I think it's 10% faster.
[452.00 --> 456.00]  If it's in the price range, it's like, oh, it's gonna run that fast.
[456.00 --> 457.00]  Cool.
[457.00 --> 458.00]  Um.
[458.00 --> 460.00]  But we're all creative people.
[460.00 --> 461.00]  We like doing fun things.
[461.00 --> 466.00]  And inspired by the PC Build Log section of the forum where people do crazy crap all
[466.00 --> 471.00]  the time, I started to realize that, uh, everything's really fast and that's cool.
[471.00 --> 474.00]  But the really fun part about computer modding is actually just the modding.
[474.00 --> 475.00]  Um.
[475.00 --> 481.00]  So, doing the bomb like re-inspired me to love computer hardware again.
[481.00 --> 482.00]  Which was actually really cool.
[482.00 --> 483.00]  That's a pretty big statement.
[483.00 --> 485.00]  Because like, seriously though, it did.
[485.00 --> 490.00]  Because like putting the nano in there, the whole time I'm just like, man, this is so sick.
[490.00 --> 494.00]  Like when the nano first came out, I was like, yeah, it's a short graphics card.
[494.00 --> 498.00]  Well, you were like one of the only people that was like, there are really cool situations
[498.00 --> 499.00]  for this.
[499.00 --> 500.00]  Yeah.
[500.00 --> 501.00]  Everyone else was just like, eh.
[501.00 --> 502.00]  Yeah.
[502.00 --> 503.00]  Yeah.
[503.00 --> 504.00]  But then, even then I was like, I would never buy one.
[504.00 --> 505.00]  But there's really cool situations for it.
[505.00 --> 506.00]  And then I had the bomb.
[506.00 --> 509.00]  And I was like, this is the best card right now.
[509.00 --> 512.00]  And I was like, nothing would be better in this situation.
[512.00 --> 514.00]  This is exactly what I need.
[514.00 --> 518.00]  And then the fact that like processors are running at lower temperatures.
[518.00 --> 520.00]  I didn't even care that much.
[520.00 --> 523.00]  But then when it's in the bomb, I'm like, this is really important now.
[523.00 --> 524.00]  So like, I don't know.
[524.00 --> 527.00]  I, I, it made me care a lot more about this.
[527.00 --> 528.00]  Having low draw and everything.
[528.00 --> 531.00]  So you could actually fit like a 450 watt power supply in there.
[531.00 --> 532.00]  Exactly.
[532.00 --> 533.00]  And like have it run the whole system.
[533.00 --> 535.00]  And having power supplies that are that small.
[535.00 --> 540.00]  Be like solid gold 80 plus, 450 watt power supplies.
[540.00 --> 542.00]  And then I was like, okay, that's pretty sick.
[542.00 --> 543.00]  Um, yeah.
[543.00 --> 544.00]  I don't know.
[544.00 --> 547.00]  That was, that was, I very, very much liked the bomb.
[547.00 --> 555.00]  Um, I think my favorite part of 2015 has been the like rebirth and resurgence of Channel
[555.00 --> 556.00]  Super Fun.
[556.00 --> 557.00]  Yeah.
[557.00 --> 561.00]  Cause it's been going crazy, especially in like the summer.
[561.00 --> 563.00]  And I think that might be like a seasonal thing.
[563.00 --> 564.00]  Yeah.
[564.00 --> 566.00]  Like I think people might be a little bit more interested.
[566.00 --> 567.00]  Yeah.
[567.00 --> 568.00]  Yeah.
[568.00 --> 571.00]  There's a lot more, a lot more cookable stuff I think that come up in the summer, but like
[571.00 --> 573.00]  doing stuff like Rocket League in real life.
[573.00 --> 575.00]  Rocket League in real life was amazing.
[575.00 --> 576.00]  Who gets to do that?
[576.00 --> 577.00]  Yeah.
[577.00 --> 579.00]  Like it's, it's so ridiculous.
[579.00 --> 580.00]  Swagway jousting.
[580.00 --> 582.00]  So ridiculous.
[582.00 --> 587.00]  Um, the one that came out on vessel last night.
[587.00 --> 589.00]  So vessel people should be over.
[589.00 --> 591.00]  If you should have watched it already.
[591.00 --> 592.00]  Yeah.
[592.00 --> 593.00]  If you haven't, you should definitely watch it.
[593.00 --> 594.00]  It's pretty good.
[594.00 --> 595.00]  Should we just say what it is?
[595.00 --> 596.00]  Sure.
[596.00 --> 597.00]  Yeah.
[597.00 --> 598.00]  The, the star Wars one.
[598.00 --> 600.00]  It's a star Wars custom made lightsaber.
[600.00 --> 601.00]  Yeah.
[601.00 --> 603.00]  DIY lightsabers under $25 bomb costs.
[603.00 --> 604.00]  So yeah.
[604.00 --> 608.00]  And there's like really, there's really sick special effects on there.
[608.00 --> 609.00]  And they glow and stuff.
[609.00 --> 610.00]  Yeah.
[610.00 --> 613.00]  I think Burke was actually watching it on his computer.
[613.00 --> 614.00]  Yeah.
[614.00 --> 615.00]  Yes.
[615.00 --> 616.00]  That's awesome.
[616.00 --> 618.00]  But I really, really enjoyed that video and Chow's good.
[618.00 --> 620.00]  It's probably my favorite channel right now.
[620.00 --> 622.00]  Um, I'm going to say something a little bit weird.
[622.00 --> 625.00]  I don't really watch our Linus tech tips videos on vessel much.
[625.00 --> 627.00]  I watch every single one of our channels,
[627.00 --> 631.00]  super fun videos, like within an hour of it coming out on vessel every single time.
[631.00 --> 632.00]  Yeah.
[632.00 --> 633.00]  I can't wait.
[633.00 --> 634.00]  Yeah.
[634.00 --> 635.00]  That's not even a shill thing.
[635.00 --> 636.00]  Like I literally do that.
[636.00 --> 637.00]  Yeah.
[637.00 --> 639.00]  Um, that's just the channel being awesome.
[639.00 --> 640.00]  Yeah.
[640.00 --> 641.00]  Yeah.
[641.00 --> 642.00]  But yeah, it's been fun, man.
[642.00 --> 645.00]  A lot of people, like I created a thread yesterday about like, Oh, tell me what your favorite
[645.00 --> 648.00]  part of 2015 was for Linus media group.
[648.00 --> 654.00]  Um, a surprising number of people really liked the pyro, which I was the, I know.
[654.00 --> 655.00]  Yeah.
[655.00 --> 659.00]  But I think it was partially Linus's arm hair getting burnt that people enjoyed very much
[659.00 --> 661.00]  or hitting the Mac or hitting the Mac because he asked on the forum.
[661.00 --> 662.00]  Right.
[662.00 --> 663.00]  Right.
[663.00 --> 664.00]  Right.
[664.00 --> 665.00]  I don't know.
[665.00 --> 666.00]  Um, what about new people?
[666.00 --> 668.00]  You're now working with another guy in your department?
[668.00 --> 669.00]  Yeah, I know.
[669.00 --> 670.00]  He sucks.
[670.00 --> 671.00]  He's just, he's not here.
[671.00 --> 672.00]  He's not a bus.
[672.00 --> 673.00]  He's not a Greyhound right now.
[673.00 --> 676.00]  So he's probably not even watching cause too much data.
[676.00 --> 677.00]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[677.00 --> 678.00]  Whatever Colton.
[678.00 --> 679.00]  But, uh, no, he's good, man.
[679.00 --> 680.00]  Everyone.
[680.00 --> 681.00]  There's a lot more people now.
[681.00 --> 682.00]  It's crazy.
[682.00 --> 684.00]  Cause Dennis, Colton, and John.
[684.00 --> 687.00]  I was, I think the sixth person here.
[687.00 --> 688.00]  Okay.
[688.00 --> 689.00]  I totally lost track.
[689.00 --> 692.00]  And now there's like, now there's like 11.
[692.00 --> 693.00]  Were you before Burkle or after?
[693.00 --> 694.00]  Before.
[694.00 --> 695.00]  Before.
[695.00 --> 696.00]  Okay.
[696.00 --> 697.00]  I thought you were after.
[697.00 --> 698.00]  No.
[698.00 --> 699.00]  Okay.
[699.00 --> 700.00]  But yeah, it's crazy.
[700.00 --> 701.00]  Cause like you were like, Oh yeah.
[701.00 --> 702.00]  It feels like you just started a few months ago.
[702.00 --> 705.00]  It feels like a few months ago, Burkle started.
[705.00 --> 706.00]  And that was over a year ago.
[706.00 --> 707.00]  Now.
[707.00 --> 708.00]  Burkle's like an old school employee at this point.
[708.00 --> 709.00]  Yeah.
[709.00 --> 710.00]  Yeah.
[710.00 --> 711.00]  It's crazy.
[711.00 --> 715.00]  And that's why, like I was thinking up videos to put on this list and I was going,
[715.00 --> 716.00]  yeah, this one.
[716.00 --> 718.00]  And I was like, that happened in 2014.
[718.00 --> 719.00]  Yeah.
[719.00 --> 720.00]  What the heck?
[720.00 --> 722.00]  Like when did we build the mineral computer?
[722.00 --> 723.00]  Like 2014 or 2015?
[723.00 --> 725.00]  Like middle of 2014.
[725.00 --> 726.00]  Yeah.
[726.00 --> 727.00]  That's crazy.
[727.00 --> 729.00]  It started in like June or July of 2014.
[729.00 --> 730.00]  That's insane.
[730.00 --> 733.00]  Cause I looked at this and was like, Oh, why is there no mineral computer?
[733.00 --> 736.00]  It's like, wait, what did I do this year?
[736.00 --> 740.00]  I remember things in like the last couple of months.
[740.00 --> 741.00]  Yeah.
[741.00 --> 744.00]  Um, going back to Confutex was cool.
[744.00 --> 745.00]  Yeah.
[745.00 --> 746.00]  Getting another chance at Confutex was cool.
[746.00 --> 747.00]  I think we did it right this time.
[747.00 --> 748.00]  Yeah.
[748.00 --> 749.00]  Sending one team, not two teams.
[749.00 --> 753.00]  Cause CES has enough content for two teams, but I don't think Confutex does.
[753.00 --> 755.00]  Three teams this year.
[755.00 --> 756.00]  Yeah.
[756.00 --> 757.00]  We'll probably be fine.
[757.00 --> 758.00]  CES has a lot of stuff.
[758.00 --> 759.00]  CES has a lot of stuff.
[759.00 --> 762.00]  Computex is not quite as much stuff.
[762.00 --> 763.00]  Yeah.
[763.00 --> 765.00]  Um, hanging out with Dennis before he became an employee.
[765.00 --> 766.00]  That was pretty cool.
[766.00 --> 767.00]  Yeah.
[767.00 --> 768.00]  Yeah.
[768.00 --> 769.00]  Yeah.
[769.00 --> 770.00]  Like, so what do you think of him?
[770.00 --> 773.00]  And we're asking him for like filming and editing.
[773.00 --> 774.00]  I'm like, he's cool.
[774.00 --> 776.00]  I hung out with him in Taiwan.
[776.00 --> 777.00]  He was cool.
[777.00 --> 778.00]  He was helpful.
[778.00 --> 779.00]  I don't know.
[779.00 --> 781.00]  He knew his way around Taiwan.
[781.00 --> 783.00]  He's good at finding things to do.
[783.00 --> 785.00]  I like, uh, what are you asking me?
[785.00 --> 786.00]  Yeah.
[786.00 --> 790.00]  Um, working with vessel.
[790.00 --> 794.00]  That was a, that was a 2015 thing.
[794.00 --> 795.00]  Yeah.
[795.00 --> 796.00]  That's the launch in 2015.
[796.00 --> 797.00]  That was an insane launch day.
[797.00 --> 798.00]  We're talking a lot about vessel.
[798.00 --> 799.00]  We're talking a lot about vessel.
[799.00 --> 801.00]  But I was going to talk about the launch day.
[801.00 --> 802.00]  The launch day was ridiculous.
[802.00 --> 803.00]  You and I didn't sleep.
[803.00 --> 808.00]  No, we stayed up the whole night cause we were worried about, they ended up being
[808.00 --> 812.00]  fine, but we were worried about vessel servers being able to accept all the people
[812.00 --> 816.00]  signing up cause they were doing like a free year within the first, what three days or
[816.00 --> 817.00]  something for 72 hours.
[817.00 --> 818.00]  I think so.
[818.00 --> 819.00]  Yeah.
[819.00 --> 821.00]  We were like, we need to make sure that everyone is able to get.
[821.00 --> 822.00]  Yeah.
[822.00 --> 827.00]  Like, so we like Linus for cell made a website for us where people could register.
[827.00 --> 832.00]  And then we had vessel agree that if we had them on this registration sheet that they
[832.00 --> 835.00]  would get an account, even if the website was down or whatever and all this kind of
[835.00 --> 837.00]  stuff, then their website ended up being fine.
[837.00 --> 841.00]  So we had to like send our database over to them like six different times.
[841.00 --> 844.00]  And the whole time they're like, guys, our website's fine.
[844.00 --> 845.00]  You don't need to be doing this.
[845.00 --> 848.00]  But I'm like, but people are still going.
[848.00 --> 850.00]  So we gotta keep doing this.
[850.00 --> 855.00]  We ended up not sleeping and then had to go back to work the next day.
[855.00 --> 857.00]  Cause Linus was in Asia at that point.
[857.00 --> 858.00]  Yeah.
[858.00 --> 859.00]  So I was mass producing videos.
[859.00 --> 860.00]  Linus is in Asia.
[860.00 --> 863.00]  He's supporting me and doing his normal job.
[863.00 --> 865.00]  And we had to do the vessel launch.
[865.00 --> 866.00]  That was insane.
[866.00 --> 867.00]  I forgot that happened this year.
[867.00 --> 868.00]  Yeah.
[868.00 --> 870.00]  People are like, oh, you guys just make videos.
[870.00 --> 871.00]  Fine.
[871.00 --> 876.00]  We were working literally 20 hour work days for at least like a week while Linus was
[876.00 --> 877.00]  at least a week.
[877.00 --> 878.00]  Yeah.
[878.00 --> 879.00]  That was ridiculous.
[879.00 --> 881.00]  Cause we had to make up for all the mistakes of X.
[881.00 --> 882.00]  Right.
[882.00 --> 884.00]  That's how we put out there is X.
[884.00 --> 885.00]  X.
[885.00 --> 886.00]  Yeah.
[886.00 --> 889.00]  Moving to the new office.
[889.00 --> 890.00]  That'll happen.
[890.00 --> 891.00]  Oh man.
[891.00 --> 892.00]  This whole place.
[892.00 --> 893.00]  Oh, man.
[893.00 --> 894.00]  Happened this year.
[894.00 --> 895.00]  I, okay.
[895.00 --> 896.00]  I can comment on my experience with the new office.
[896.00 --> 897.00]  There you go.
[897.00 --> 899.00]  My entire workflow got destroyed.
[899.00 --> 903.00]  Because there was no warning.
[903.00 --> 905.00]  So it was literally like, hey, we're moving today.
[905.00 --> 910.00]  I was like, okay, like I have all these things happening like that.
[910.00 --> 911.00]  I can't miss.
[911.00 --> 912.00]  They're like, yeah.
[912.00 --> 913.00]  Okay.
[913.00 --> 914.00]  Well, do as well as the move.
[914.00 --> 916.00]  And I'm like, you kidding?
[916.00 --> 917.00]  What?
[917.00 --> 922.00]  So yeah, the move was extremely difficult for me.
[922.00 --> 923.00]  Yeah.
[923.00 --> 926.00]  Um, like once I got like a week into it, it was fine.
[926.00 --> 929.00]  But just the first couple of days I was like, well, everything is screwed.
[929.00 --> 930.00]  Yeah.
[930.00 --> 931.00]  Everything is just done.
[931.00 --> 932.00]  Yeah.
[932.00 --> 934.00]  Um, it was ridiculous.
[934.00 --> 940.00]  Like looking around here and seeing how much stuff we have and how much we had when we were at that house.
[940.00 --> 946.00]  Like people hate on how dirty it was, but Linus is right when he says, it's like, you're trying to do one of those things.
[946.00 --> 953.00]  You're trying to do one of those picture puzzles where you have one missing block and you have to move the rest to make a picture, except there's no missing block.
[953.00 --> 956.00]  So you're just trying to slam stuff into each other all day long.
[956.00 --> 962.00]  There was no like, this place is honestly getting to the point of like being full.
[962.00 --> 966.00]  And we fit a very large percentage of this stuff in that house.
[966.00 --> 967.00]  In a house.
[967.00 --> 968.00]  Which was way smaller than us.
[968.00 --> 969.00]  It's like half the size.
[969.00 --> 970.00]  Less.
[970.00 --> 971.00]  Less than half.
[971.00 --> 972.00]  Yeah.
[972.00 --> 974.00]  That was crazy.
[974.00 --> 975.00]  Um, yeah.
[975.00 --> 977.00]  The move was ridiculous.
[977.00 --> 979.00]  So it's been so good since then though.
[979.00 --> 980.00]  Yeah.
[980.00 --> 984.00]  The new, the new space has been, I'm sure you guys have noticed in the videos.
[984.00 --> 987.00]  I actually saw one person being like the old videos were better.
[987.00 --> 988.00]  And I was like, what videos are you watching?
[988.00 --> 989.00]  Yeah.
[989.00 --> 990.00]  But people always say that.
[990.00 --> 991.00]  Yeah.
[991.00 --> 993.00]  I had to watch a video for some reason.
[993.00 --> 994.00]  I think I was doing research for something.
[994.00 --> 995.00]  Yeah.
[995.00 --> 996.00]  Like a previous product or whatever.
[996.00 --> 997.00]  And we had a video on it.
[997.00 --> 998.00]  So I watched it.
[998.00 --> 1003.00]  And the whole time I'm just like, wow, this was pretty bad.
[1003.00 --> 1005.00]  Like, what were we doing?
[1005.00 --> 1007.00]  I like, I understand it.
[1007.00 --> 1011.00]  Cause like at that point in time, I think we had two editors.
[1011.00 --> 1014.00]  So I think there was four of us.
[1014.00 --> 1015.00]  Yeah.
[1015.00 --> 1016.00]  There was four of us.
[1016.00 --> 1019.00]  So we had two editors and we were still releasing like nine videos a week.
[1019.00 --> 1026.00]  So, so like I got it, but watching the thing, I was like, damn, I'm happy that we're where
[1026.00 --> 1029.00]  we're at now because the competition is really good.
[1029.00 --> 1030.00]  Yeah.
[1030.00 --> 1034.00]  And back then we would not have been able to keep up if we were where we at then compared
[1034.00 --> 1035.00]  to now.
[1035.00 --> 1039.00]  Like everyone, like every tech YouTuber now is crazy.
[1039.00 --> 1040.00]  Yeah.
[1040.00 --> 1044.00]  Even just looking at like Harbor Canucks is like picture quality.
[1044.00 --> 1046.00]  Like everything they release just looks beautiful.
[1046.00 --> 1048.00]  Everything they do is amazing.
[1048.00 --> 1050.00]  Just absolutely beautiful.
[1050.00 --> 1052.00]  Like I love what Brandon does.
[1052.00 --> 1057.00]  And then I watch what Dimitri does and I'm like, this is so amazing and slightly different.
[1057.00 --> 1058.00]  Yeah.
[1058.00 --> 1059.00]  But just, I like that they're not the same.
[1059.00 --> 1060.00]  Yeah.
[1060.00 --> 1061.00]  That makes me really happy.
[1061.00 --> 1062.00]  Yeah.
[1062.00 --> 1063.00]  They have just like such a bromance.
[1063.00 --> 1065.00]  Speaking of Brandon, should I pull him in?
[1065.00 --> 1066.00]  Yeah.
[1066.00 --> 1067.00]  Brandon!
[1071.00 --> 1072.00]  I'll go get him.
[1072.00 --> 1074.00]  Anyway, bye Twitch.
[1074.00 --> 1079.00]  So this is kind of going to be how it goes for the whole whatever you want to call this
[1079.00 --> 1080.00]  show.
[1080.00 --> 1082.00]  It's not weekly analysis and news at all.
[1082.00 --> 1085.00]  This is like yearly analysis and no news.
[1085.00 --> 1089.00]  So basically that was Nick's segment.
[1089.00 --> 1094.00]  I didn't want to kick him off, but we talked for a while and I need to go through like basically
[1094.00 --> 1095.00]  everyone at the office.
[1095.00 --> 1097.00]  So yeah.
[1097.00 --> 1099.00]  We're going to move on a little bit.
[1099.00 --> 1101.00]  I don't know where Brandon is.
[1101.00 --> 1104.00]  So I'm going to try to find a way to keep talking.
[1104.00 --> 1106.00]  My, oh wow.
[1106.00 --> 1108.00]  I can't even see X split.
[1108.00 --> 1109.00]  Give me a second.
[1109.00 --> 1111.00]  Hi, Aunt Venom.
[1111.00 --> 1112.00]  Hi, Nick.
[1112.00 --> 1113.00]  Hi.
[1113.00 --> 1114.00]  You find Brandon?
[1114.00 --> 1115.00]  Brandon will be a few minutes.
[1115.00 --> 1116.00]  Okay.
[1116.00 --> 1117.00]  But he's coming.
[1117.00 --> 1118.00]  Yay.
[1118.00 --> 1119.00]  Yay.
[1119.00 --> 1120.00]  Um, yeah.
[1120.00 --> 1122.00]  What to expect in 2016?
[1122.00 --> 1124.00]  Just more of everything.
[1124.00 --> 1125.00]  More better.
[1125.00 --> 1127.00]  I want to do more crazy builds.
[1127.00 --> 1128.00]  More better.
[1128.00 --> 1130.00]  That's going to be a thing for me, I think.
[1130.00 --> 1131.00]  I want that to be a thing for me.
[1131.00 --> 1135.00]  I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it a thing for me.
[1135.00 --> 1138.00]  I will have personal rig updates in 2016.
[1138.00 --> 1140.00]  At least two big ones.
[1140.00 --> 1141.00]  Yeah.
[1141.00 --> 1142.00]  Okay.
[1142.00 --> 1143.00]  At least one big one.
[1143.00 --> 1145.00]  Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.
[1145.00 --> 1147.00]  I need to make sure that I don't overpromise.
[1147.00 --> 1150.00]  There will be at least one big personal rig update.
[1150.00 --> 1153.00]  If I end up doing my second build, then there will be two.
[1153.00 --> 1156.00]  But I don't know if I'm going to end up doing my second build.
[1156.00 --> 1158.00]  What else in 2016?
[1158.00 --> 1159.00]  New content.
[1159.00 --> 1160.00]  New content.
[1160.00 --> 1163.00]  We discussed a couple ideas.
[1163.00 --> 1164.00]  Possible new channel, maybe.
[1164.00 --> 1165.00]  Yeah.
[1165.00 --> 1167.00]  We have a couple things kicking around.
[1167.00 --> 1169.00]  There's stuff kicking around.
[1169.00 --> 1173.00]  There's one really solid channel idea, but we can't talk about it yet.
[1173.00 --> 1174.00]  There's...
[1174.00 --> 1175.00]  Yeah.
[1175.00 --> 1176.00]  Grip.
[1176.00 --> 1177.00]  Grip.
[1177.00 --> 1187.00]  There is an expansion or like an extrusion from a channel that we have.
[1187.00 --> 1188.00]  That may be coming soon.
[1188.00 --> 1190.00]  So stay tuned for that.
[1190.00 --> 1191.00]  Oh, that.
[1191.00 --> 1192.00]  Yeah.
[1192.00 --> 1193.00]  Okay.
[1193.00 --> 1194.00]  That's going to be fun.
[1194.00 --> 1195.00]  Yeah.
[1195.00 --> 1196.00]  Yeah.
[1196.00 --> 1197.00]  That's an okay way of describing it.
[1197.00 --> 1198.00]  No one's going to get it, but it kind of makes sense.
[1198.00 --> 1199.00]  It's like...
[1199.00 --> 1200.00]  Think about...
[1200.00 --> 1201.00]  It's like an expansion pack.
[1201.00 --> 1202.00]  Think about the channels that we have.
[1202.00 --> 1205.00]  And then we're taking one of those and we're going like, okay, this is the theme of the channel.
[1205.00 --> 1206.00]  It's not.
[1206.00 --> 1209.00]  We're going to do something specific that's like similar, but quite different at the same time.
[1209.00 --> 1210.00]  It's not like DLC.
[1210.00 --> 1212.00]  Like it's bigger than that.
[1212.00 --> 1213.00]  It's much bigger than DLC.
[1213.00 --> 1214.00]  Yeah.
[1214.00 --> 1215.00]  It's like...
[1215.00 --> 1219.00]  But then it's not a total new thing completely.
[1219.00 --> 1222.00]  So it's not like on the level of like...
[1222.00 --> 1224.00]  It's not Diablo 2.
[1224.00 --> 1225.00]  Yeah.
[1225.00 --> 1228.00]  It's Diablo 1 expansion pack 1.
[1228.00 --> 1229.00]  Yeah.
[1229.00 --> 1230.00]  Yeah.
[1230.00 --> 1231.00]  Anyway.
[1231.00 --> 1232.00]  Hi, Brandon.
[1232.00 --> 1233.00]  Bye.
[1233.00 --> 1234.00]  Hello.
[1234.00 --> 1236.00]  What were your favorite things that happened this year?
[1236.00 --> 1237.00]  Oh my god.
[1237.00 --> 1239.00]  That's a really broad question.
[1239.00 --> 1241.00]  It is a broad question.
[1241.00 --> 1242.00]  Let's see.
[1242.00 --> 1243.00]  Did you go to NAB this year?
[1243.00 --> 1245.00]  I did go to NAB this year.
[1245.00 --> 1246.00]  So how was that?
[1246.00 --> 1247.00]  NAB was awesome.
[1247.00 --> 1248.00]  Are you planning on going this next year?
[1248.00 --> 1250.00]  I would like to go again.
[1250.00 --> 1251.00]  That would be awesome.
[1251.00 --> 1252.00]  Like it was...
[1252.00 --> 1256.00]  If you want him to go again, go watch his recent video on the camera thing.
[1256.00 --> 1257.00]  The A7S2.
[1257.00 --> 1258.00]  And share it and like it.
[1258.00 --> 1263.00]  And there's another video coming out that's on Vessel right now.
[1263.00 --> 1265.00]  It's a HandyTech.
[1265.00 --> 1267.00]  But it's a camera edition HandyTech.
[1267.00 --> 1268.00]  Under $50.
[1268.00 --> 1270.00]  Which is the lowest HandyTech that we've ever done.
[1270.00 --> 1271.00]  So five bongo ties.
[1272.00 --> 1273.00]  Basically.
[1276.00 --> 1278.00]  But yeah, NAB was good this year.
[1278.00 --> 1281.00]  It was interesting seeing all the new stuff.
[1281.00 --> 1284.00]  And going and actually covering it for the first time.
[1284.00 --> 1285.00]  Because I've been there before.
[1285.00 --> 1286.00]  Yeah.
[1286.00 --> 1287.00]  I've been there once.
[1287.00 --> 1288.00]  I'm going a second time.
[1288.00 --> 1293.00]  You learn a lot and you get to see like a lot of how people do things that aren't like,
[1293.00 --> 1294.00]  you know, what we do.
[1294.00 --> 1295.00]  So that's always really interesting.
[1295.00 --> 1296.00]  I would actually even...
[1296.00 --> 1297.00]  Like I probably won't end up going...
[1297.00 --> 1300.00]  I would like to go to NAB as a spectator just to see...
[1300.00 --> 1304.00]  Because I'm starting to slightly get interested in that kind of stuff.
[1304.00 --> 1305.00]  Yeah.
[1305.00 --> 1308.00]  So it would be just kind of cool to like see things that I probably won't understand right
[1308.00 --> 1309.00]  off the bat.
[1309.00 --> 1311.00]  Hey, the first time I was there I was just like, what is that?
[1311.00 --> 1312.00]  Yeah, exactly.
[1312.00 --> 1313.00]  I don't know what that does.
[1313.00 --> 1314.00]  That's cool though.
[1314.00 --> 1315.00]  And just everything is over...
[1315.00 --> 1316.00]  It's overwhelming.
[1316.00 --> 1320.00]  It's like being at CES but not knowing anything about tech.
[1320.00 --> 1322.00]  Like, what's a smart watch?
[1322.00 --> 1323.00]  I don't...
[1323.00 --> 1324.00]  Right, right, right.
[1324.00 --> 1325.00]  I think that could be cool.
[1325.00 --> 1328.00]  Because like I know next to nothing about all that kind of stuff.
[1328.00 --> 1329.00]  But I'm trying to get into it.
[1329.00 --> 1330.00]  Right.
[1330.00 --> 1331.00]  So that could be fun.
[1331.00 --> 1332.00]  What else?
[1332.00 --> 1333.00]  Like you're hosting a lot more videos now.
[1333.00 --> 1335.00]  Yeah, it's been an interesting part of it.
[1335.00 --> 1341.00]  I'm still improving but I've enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.
[1341.00 --> 1343.00]  Which is good, I guess.
[1343.00 --> 1346.00]  Yeah, talking about camera stuff is...
[1346.00 --> 1347.00]  I do that anyway.
[1347.00 --> 1351.00]  So like Linus is just like, just do it in front of a camera.
[1351.00 --> 1352.00]  So I'm like, okay, sure.
[1352.00 --> 1353.00]  Give it a shot a couple times.
[1353.00 --> 1355.00]  I'll hopefully keep doing it.
[1355.00 --> 1358.00]  You seem to be very well accepted on the channel, which is actually super cool.
[1358.00 --> 1359.00]  That's cool.
[1359.00 --> 1360.00]  Thanks guys.
[1360.00 --> 1361.00]  Yeah.
[1361.00 --> 1362.00]  Yeah.
[1362.00 --> 1364.00]  What was your favorite thing to shoot this year?
[1364.00 --> 1365.00]  Favorite thing to shoot?
[1365.00 --> 1366.00]  Oh my god.
[1366.00 --> 1367.00]  That's a really...
[1367.00 --> 1368.00]  I don't even...
[1368.00 --> 1369.00]  If I could even think of how many...
[1369.00 --> 1370.00]  It's like over 300 videos, you gotta pick one.
[1370.00 --> 1374.00]  ...products I've had to shoot this year or like everything that we did.
[1374.00 --> 1375.00]  Not even necessarily.
[1375.00 --> 1376.00]  Yeah, right.
[1376.00 --> 1377.00]  Uh...
[1377.00 --> 1381.00]  Honestly, the thing that we just shot the other day...
[1381.00 --> 1382.00]  Really?
[1382.00 --> 1383.00]  Yeah.
[1383.00 --> 1384.00]  That...
[1384.00 --> 1385.00]  I was hoping you'd like that.
[1385.00 --> 1386.00]  Okay, so that is releasing...
[1386.00 --> 1389.00]  If you're watching live, that is releasing in 10 hours.
[1389.00 --> 1394.00]  If you're watching in the archive, it was the one before this video.
[1394.00 --> 1395.00]  Yeah.
[1395.00 --> 1397.00]  Because this video is being uploaded tomorrow.
[1397.00 --> 1398.00]  Oh, I see.
[1398.00 --> 1399.00]  Right.
[1399.00 --> 1400.00]  And it's tonight's video.
[1400.00 --> 1401.00]  Yeah, right.
[1401.00 --> 1402.00]  Right.
[1402.00 --> 1403.00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1403.00 --> 1404.00]  That's right.
[1404.00 --> 1405.00]  Weird.
[1405.00 --> 1406.00]  Yeah.
[1406.00 --> 1407.00]  It is weird.
[1407.00 --> 1408.00]  But...
[1408.00 --> 1409.00]  I was hoping you liked shooting that.
[1409.00 --> 1410.00]  That's cool.
[1410.00 --> 1411.00]  It was good.
[1411.00 --> 1412.00]  Yeah, cool.
[1412.00 --> 1413.00]  I think it went really smoothly.
[1413.00 --> 1414.00]  Yeah.
[1414.00 --> 1415.00]  And I think...
[1415.00 --> 1418.00]  I'm watching Ed edit it right now and it's turning out really well.
[1418.00 --> 1419.00]  Yeah?
[1419.00 --> 1420.00]  Have you seen a cut of it at all?
[1420.00 --> 1421.00]  No, but you should see the part...
[1421.00 --> 1424.00]  I was watching a little bit of the part where you guys were like talking and then they were
[1424.00 --> 1426.00]  talking and it was working out really well.
[1426.00 --> 1427.00]  That's good?
[1427.00 --> 1428.00]  Okay, cool.
[1428.00 --> 1429.00]  That's really good.
[1429.00 --> 1430.00]  That's really good.
[1430.00 --> 1431.00]  As vague as I can be.
[1431.00 --> 1432.00]  That...
[1432.00 --> 1437.00]  one of the most important things of hints is that Scrapyard Wars was the start of the
[1437.00 --> 1440.00]  show-like kind of content.
[1440.00 --> 1443.00]  The next one that we were doing is one episode.
[1443.00 --> 1444.00]  Not multiple episodes.
[1444.00 --> 1446.00]  You don't have to wait for anything.
[1446.00 --> 1451.00]  It's all there in one big thing and it's kind of the same idea of show-like content.
[1451.00 --> 1454.00]  That's all the information I'm going to give you guys.
[1454.00 --> 1457.00]  I hope you guys like it, it's my little brain child and...
[1457.00 --> 1458.00]  Yeah.
[1458.00 --> 1461.14]  We really want people to like it a lot so we can do more of them because it's really fun.
[1461.26 --> 1461.42]  Yeah.
[1461.90 --> 1462.02]  Yeah.
[1463.28 --> 1467.06]  All the, I don't know, like, I guess from a, we're in a new office now.
[1467.10 --> 1469.04]  That's probably, like, my favorite part of my new space.
[1469.04 --> 1471.78]  You have the lighting grid and stuff now compared to the old office.
[1471.78 --> 1480.86]  We now have a lighting grid which allows me to hang the majority of the lights that we use on or, like, above.
[1481.20 --> 1486.86]  So we don't have to have stands on the ground, which frees up a lot of floor space and helps us out when we're moving stuff around
[1486.86 --> 1488.06]  and, like, need to move quickly.
[1488.20 --> 1489.46]  And, oh, bye, Nick.
[1489.56 --> 1490.00]  You out of here?
[1490.02 --> 1490.36]  Merry Christmas.
[1490.52 --> 1491.20]  Have a good one.
[1492.52 --> 1498.34]  And having that just minimizes setup time by so much.
[1498.34 --> 1500.28]  It's honestly super cool.
[1500.32 --> 1501.06]  And, like, I love when time has been saved.
[1501.16 --> 1501.32]  Yeah.
[1501.56 --> 1508.78]  Like, took us a while to get everything done, but now that it's all done and I'm looking up and I just see lights everywhere, it makes me happy.
[1510.30 --> 1512.92]  If you know Brandon, like, he's not exaggerating.
[1513.10 --> 1515.24]  It probably directly increases his happiness level.
[1515.24 --> 1516.08]  Yes, absolutely.
[1516.08 --> 1520.06]  Every single day I walk in here, oh, I don't have to set up five things before we can do anything.
[1520.26 --> 1520.70]  That's great.
[1520.76 --> 1528.14]  The other day after that crazy thing that we filmed, I think you had left and I came in here and realized that all the lights were on.
[1528.20 --> 1529.32]  I was like, how do I do this?
[1529.60 --> 1534.06]  And then followed the cable, found the squid, pressed the one button.
[1534.18 --> 1535.74]  It was like, all off.
[1536.16 --> 1537.86]  Wow, that's really nice.
[1538.14 --> 1542.26]  Yeah, I'm still going to make that even better, but for now that's how it is.
[1542.26 --> 1543.80]  It's one switch, which is still good.
[1543.90 --> 1546.04]  It makes it a lot easier to manage things.
[1546.40 --> 1546.88]  How about you?
[1546.94 --> 1548.48]  What was your, like?
[1548.74 --> 1550.94]  I keep on bouncing back and forth.
[1551.06 --> 1556.04]  So I'm going to try to answer that in regards to things that you were a part of, I guess, is how I'll try.
[1556.04 --> 1562.36]  What was the, what was the, what was the, this year, like, I feel like this year started and I blinked and now we're at.
[1563.02 --> 1569.00]  Yeah, I know, seriously, that's like when Nick and I were on here, we were just slowly remembering all the things.
[1569.00 --> 1571.84]  And part of the problem is filtering out things that happened in 2014.
[1572.18 --> 1572.44]  Yeah.
[1572.60 --> 1573.98]  Because some of them feel like they spill over.
[1574.10 --> 1576.50]  We produce so much stuff that it's really hard to remember.
[1576.74 --> 1576.92]  God.
[1576.92 --> 1579.48]  One thing that I liked was going back to Taiwan again.
[1579.58 --> 1580.20]  That was cool.
[1580.32 --> 1581.20]  That was really awesome.
[1581.42 --> 1581.52]  Yeah.
[1581.60 --> 1582.32]  Taiwan was awesome.
[1582.44 --> 1583.54]  Computex was a lot of fun.
[1583.88 --> 1584.02]  Yeah.
[1584.02 --> 1586.60]  It's nice seeing all the people we get to see when we go to shows like that.
[1586.94 --> 1589.28]  And Taiwan's like super awesome.
[1589.40 --> 1590.02]  One of my favorite places.
[1590.02 --> 1591.32]  People are so nice there.
[1591.44 --> 1591.66]  Yeah.
[1591.82 --> 1596.80]  One thing that I noticed is everyone gives Canada the stereotype of like everyone in Canada is really nice.
[1596.80 --> 1598.10]  And that's great.
[1598.26 --> 1601.80]  And I like that because I like being known as like a nice Canadian person.
[1601.90 --> 1602.44]  That's cool.
[1602.44 --> 1611.68]  But then you go to Taiwan and like honestly I was like man I think I need to be nicer because these guys are nicer than me.
[1611.84 --> 1613.06]  And that's like our stereotype.
[1613.12 --> 1613.32]  Yeah.
[1613.40 --> 1613.64]  I know.
[1613.94 --> 1615.26]  I need to step up my game.
[1616.44 --> 1618.56]  It was surprising how welcoming everyone is.
[1618.68 --> 1618.92]  Yeah.
[1619.66 --> 1621.72]  Honestly I didn't even feel like it was that crowded.
[1621.90 --> 1623.24]  Like their population is really high.
[1623.50 --> 1627.32]  But their density seems all over the place depending on where you are.
[1627.32 --> 1631.70]  Like that's one thing about Canada is there's not a ton of us.
[1631.70 --> 1635.12]  There's less people in all of Canada than there is in just the state of California.
[1635.84 --> 1639.48]  But we all bundle into these tiny ultra compact groups.
[1639.68 --> 1640.70]  It's ridiculous.
[1641.34 --> 1646.24]  So like Vancouver the city that we're really close to is like jam packed.
[1646.92 --> 1652.28]  And then Taiwan has cities that are just sprawling and really big.
[1652.38 --> 1654.40]  So the density is there.
[1654.52 --> 1655.52]  It's not insane.
[1656.44 --> 1657.70]  It's definitely there though.
[1657.78 --> 1659.56]  But then it spreads itself out a little bit.
[1659.56 --> 1661.22]  In Canada it's like nope.
[1661.52 --> 1662.66]  Shove it in a little corner.
[1662.90 --> 1663.86]  We have all this land.
[1663.98 --> 1664.78]  But screw it.
[1664.78 --> 1664.96]  Yeah.
[1665.00 --> 1665.92]  Let's not use that.
[1665.96 --> 1667.18]  Pack into these little things.
[1667.60 --> 1667.98]  So yeah.
[1668.12 --> 1669.28]  It actually wasn't that bad.
[1670.40 --> 1670.96]  I don't know.
[1671.62 --> 1672.74]  What's happened this year?
[1673.38 --> 1674.78]  We did another Scrapyard Wars.
[1675.60 --> 1676.56]  We did another Scrapyard Wars.
[1676.62 --> 1677.12]  That was interesting.
[1677.12 --> 1678.20]  Did we do two this year?
[1678.20 --> 1681.50]  I think the water cooling one was this year.
[1681.58 --> 1681.80]  Yeah.
[1681.92 --> 1683.22]  I guess it started this year.
[1683.32 --> 1686.00]  So we did two Scrapyard Wars and we did the new thing.
[1686.62 --> 1686.86]  Yeah.
[1687.20 --> 1687.46]  Cool.
[1687.66 --> 1691.30]  We did three show like content things.
[1692.06 --> 1695.82]  One thing that Nick brought up is that Channel Super Fun evolved a lot this year.
[1695.82 --> 1696.20]  It did.
[1696.56 --> 1699.84]  So Linus Tech Tips shifted a little bit.
[1699.96 --> 1711.12]  We do more like fun show like things like building the crazy servers, building the bomb, doing the two gamers, one CPU rig.
[1711.66 --> 1713.18]  Like fun things like that.
[1713.18 --> 1714.56]  And we still do reviews.
[1714.86 --> 1715.00]  Yeah.
[1715.08 --> 1719.44]  And then Channel Super Fun has like way more high quality stuff.
[1720.14 --> 1726.50]  Instead of it being mostly an afterthought and making sure that it only took up like half hour of our time every week.
[1726.54 --> 1730.28]  Now it's like actually a big deal and well produced and interesting things.
[1730.54 --> 1730.56]  Yeah.
[1731.00 --> 1735.32]  Making the time for it is worthwhile just because those videos are so fun to do.
[1735.98 --> 1740.28]  And like where it can go can kind of be in so many different ways.
[1740.54 --> 1742.96]  Like the things that you can do on the channel is nuts.
[1743.44 --> 1743.56]  Yeah.
[1743.64 --> 1743.78]  Yeah.
[1743.92 --> 1744.58]  It's awesome.
[1744.82 --> 1751.26]  But Nick's done a really good job of like taking the reins on that channel and like bringing it to something that's.
[1751.44 --> 1752.08]  It really has.
[1752.18 --> 1758.48]  So Nick Van Burkle like basically like quote unquote owns that channel.
[1758.48 --> 1761.78]  Like he does a lot of the idea starting stuff.
[1762.30 --> 1765.50]  And if someone gives him an idea, he's the one that actually implements everything.
[1765.86 --> 1769.22]  So like you might spit an idea at him, but he actually does everything for it.
[1769.22 --> 1775.70]  Um, he is often shooting it or plans how it's going to be shot and then might host it.
[1775.82 --> 1778.56]  He drives a lot of the hosting, Nicky V, whatever.
[1778.90 --> 1779.00]  Yeah.
[1779.04 --> 1780.60]  Um, he edits most of it.
[1780.66 --> 1783.88]  He does like a lot of the social and stuff for it.
[1783.88 --> 1792.10]  Like he's, he's worked very hard to bring it to even more high quality content than what it used to be, which is great.
[1793.34 --> 1793.72]  Wow.
[1793.72 --> 1795.22]  There's a little icon thing.
[1795.26 --> 1796.26]  I need to make one for you.
[1796.44 --> 1798.40]  Oh, oh, that's cool.
[1798.40 --> 1802.54]  There's me, Dennis, Burkle, Nick, Light, and Linus.
[1802.60 --> 1803.58]  Where are those pictures from?
[1803.70 --> 1805.14]  From my personal Twitch.
[1805.22 --> 1805.32]  Oh.
[1806.38 --> 1808.80]  Um, if you subscribe, not to shout out my own thing.
[1808.86 --> 1812.36]  If you subscribe to my personal Twitch, you get little icons of Linus Tech Tips members.
[1813.18 --> 1817.50]  Um, but yeah, now, now that I have enough subscribers, I can add more.
[1817.64 --> 1818.90]  So I want to finish off the rest of the team.
[1818.90 --> 1819.26]  Cool.
[1820.40 --> 1820.76]  Um.
[1820.76 --> 1821.76]  What else happened to this year?
[1822.48 --> 1823.04]  Ugh.
[1823.04 --> 1831.06]  God, it's like a, it's, I think it, it feels so fast that I can't even remember half the things that, like, was it this year?
[1831.20 --> 1832.52]  Was that a long time ago?
[1834.38 --> 1836.70]  We were in a house not that long ago.
[1836.92 --> 1837.12]  Yeah.
[1837.22 --> 1842.30]  And I just remember counting down the days from when we were all like, oh yeah, we're moving.
[1842.46 --> 1844.74]  And then we're like, wait, we're moving in like five months.
[1844.74 --> 1845.06]  Okay.
[1848.26 --> 1848.66]  Yeah.
[1848.80 --> 1851.92]  How was the, uh, the prank, the office getting robbed?
[1851.92 --> 1853.26]  Oh, okay.
[1853.58 --> 1854.18]  Like, I.
[1854.72 --> 1856.32]  I think this will be our last thing and then I'll pull back.
[1856.32 --> 1856.72]  Yeah, sure.
[1857.00 --> 1866.64]  I, I remember driving up to the house and the door was wide open and who, I think it was Ed was standing outside.
[1866.80 --> 1868.02]  I'm just like, what's going on?
[1868.16 --> 1872.28]  And the next Nick, Nick, uh, Nicky V walks outside.
[1872.28 --> 1873.58]  He's like, Brandon, grab your camera.
[1873.64 --> 1873.90]  Start shooting.
[1874.00 --> 1875.04]  I'm like, why?
[1875.44 --> 1876.34]  What's going on?
[1876.42 --> 1877.76]  And then I look inside the house.
[1877.80 --> 1880.88]  I'm like, whoa, what happened?
[1880.88 --> 1882.02]  And they're like, we were robbed.
[1882.12 --> 1883.60]  I'm like, oh my God.
[1883.72 --> 1890.58]  Like just, and then, and then I think, I think it was Taron who came or no, wait, was it Taron or Nick?
[1890.74 --> 1891.82]  They can't, one of them came downstairs.
[1891.82 --> 1893.08]  Like Brandon, your headphones are gone.
[1893.10 --> 1896.60]  I'm like, oh, sure.
[1896.60 --> 1903.38]  I still remember the quote in the video of you being like, well, at least all the camera gear is still there.
[1903.60 --> 1904.62]  That was the first thing I checked.
[1904.80 --> 1907.78]  I'm like, wait, what the wouldn't take camera gear?
[1907.80 --> 1908.98]  That doesn't even make any sense.
[1908.98 --> 1915.16]  So I, I like for like, honestly, a second thought, wait, is this a joke?
[1915.40 --> 1916.24]  No, it's not a joke.
[1916.32 --> 1916.50]  It's wait.
[1916.62 --> 1925.30]  I think what sold it to me was Linus screaming about Taron's or screaming at you about the oatmeal on the floor.
[1925.32 --> 1925.62]  Yeah.
[1925.62 --> 1928.40]  That was like, when I heard that upstairs, I'm like, oh, this must be real.
[1928.50 --> 1932.22]  He had that plan to yell at me for that from like the Friday before.
[1932.22 --> 1935.10]  That, that, yeah, that really sold it.
[1935.28 --> 1940.22]  And I was completely immersed in the believability of it.
[1940.34 --> 1948.40]  And when we got upstairs and we did that, he's like, hey guys, by the way, remember that moment?
[1948.74 --> 1949.54]  Just wow.
[1949.66 --> 1951.26]  Remember when you made me miss that flight?
[1951.66 --> 1953.36]  Everyone's just like, what?
[1954.46 --> 1955.26]  Like really?
[1955.38 --> 1957.70]  You really wrecked this whole place just for this?
[1957.80 --> 1958.00]  Yeah.
[1958.32 --> 1959.42]  That actually happened.
[1959.54 --> 1960.16]  So epic.
[1960.16 --> 1961.06]  It was awesome.
[1961.64 --> 1962.08]  All right.
[1962.34 --> 1962.92]  Hey, Linus.
[1964.08 --> 1964.94]  Your turn up.
[1967.38 --> 1968.12]  Come, come.
[1968.38 --> 1968.84]  Come hither.
[1969.40 --> 1971.12]  I can get Nick as well.
[1971.90 --> 1972.56]  I think he's pretty.
[1973.06 --> 1973.94]  Are you not free?
[1974.40 --> 1974.92]  I'm not free.
[1975.04 --> 1975.32]  Okay.
[1975.58 --> 1976.04]  He's walking.
[1976.28 --> 1976.56]  All right.
[1976.68 --> 1976.94]  All right.
[1977.32 --> 1978.00]  Well, thank you.
[1978.06 --> 1979.50]  Thank you, Brandon, for joining us.
[1981.58 --> 1984.54]  So what were your favorite or least favorite things of this year?
[1984.54 --> 1987.62]  There are literally three items in the inventory system.
[1988.20 --> 1989.10]  Manufacturer razor.
[1989.68 --> 1990.72]  Description headphones.
[1990.72 --> 1994.10]  Thank you.
[1994.10 --> 1995.54]  Whoever entered those.
[1995.88 --> 1996.80]  You still have.
[1997.38 --> 1998.04]  Oh, yeah.
[1998.10 --> 1999.36]  I guess I still have residue.
[1999.50 --> 2000.40]  Like a huge thing.
[2000.74 --> 2001.04]  Yeah.
[2001.04 --> 2007.10]  So we played a fun game today called Hide the Mustache on Your Face.
[2009.16 --> 2009.52]  Nope.
[2010.26 --> 2011.16]  No, that's not what we played.
[2011.24 --> 2011.38]  Sorry.
[2011.46 --> 2012.34]  What are we doing today?
[2012.36 --> 2012.74]  Did you enjoy it?
[2012.78 --> 2013.40]  Did you like it?
[2013.48 --> 2013.74]  Yeah.
[2013.82 --> 2014.36]  It's a fun game.
[2014.36 --> 2015.36]  I like it.
[2015.36 --> 2015.48]  Yeah.
[2015.48 --> 2017.08]  No, I had a really good time.
[2017.22 --> 2020.30]  Actually, we end up playing that a lot at my place when we have games nights and stuff.
[2020.44 --> 2020.68]  Yeah.
[2020.74 --> 2021.04]  No.
[2021.04 --> 2021.58]  Because it's actually pretty good.
[2021.60 --> 2021.74]  Yeah.
[2021.74 --> 2022.24]  It's a lot of fun.
[2022.50 --> 2022.64]  Yeah.
[2022.68 --> 2022.82]  Yeah.
[2022.82 --> 2023.80]  Channel Super Fun coming up.
[2024.24 --> 2024.56]  Yeah.
[2024.78 --> 2024.98]  All right.
[2024.98 --> 2026.04]  Next Wednesday, I guess.
[2026.04 --> 2031.52]  So the whole idea is just what were your most impactful or important or favorite or least
[2031.52 --> 2033.00]  favorite things that happened this year?
[2033.14 --> 2034.62]  What mattered to you in 2015?
[2034.78 --> 2035.70]  What mattered to me in 2015?
[2035.74 --> 2040.84]  I think the biggest thing in 2015 was moving into the new office.
[2041.00 --> 2041.16]  Yeah.
[2041.28 --> 2042.50]  It was an obvious one.
[2042.90 --> 2052.44]  But for me, the biggest part of moving into the new office even was achieving the goal
[2052.44 --> 2053.58]  of organization.
[2053.58 --> 2058.90]  And it took a long time and it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.
[2058.90 --> 2064.88]  But compared to what we were dealing with before, being able to go, gee, I sure need
[2064.88 --> 2066.24]  a DVI cable right now.
[2066.40 --> 2072.42]  And there being one place where I can go where there will, with 90% certainty, be a DVI cable
[2072.42 --> 2075.62]  makes such a huge difference to my workflow.
[2075.78 --> 2081.24]  And even having somewhere to work, like one of the worst things before we left the old office
[2081.24 --> 2085.86]  was setting up servers and working on servers because they're loud.
[2087.12 --> 2088.30]  They're bulky.
[2089.06 --> 2093.18]  And you can't really, because they're loud and bulky, you can't have them in a set.
[2093.34 --> 2095.14]  You can't have them in an office space.
[2095.14 --> 2100.02]  So the place I actually had to work on all the server stuff was at the top of the stairs
[2100.02 --> 2101.02]  in the middle of the hallway.
[2101.18 --> 2101.80]  It was terrible.
[2102.14 --> 2107.28]  People literally needed to step over me to get down the stairs or across the hallway to
[2107.28 --> 2107.64]  talk to Nick.
[2107.64 --> 2113.26]  And like big guys like myself, I had to like arm pull myself over and like jump four or
[2113.26 --> 2115.60]  five stairs to like launch myself over top of them.
[2115.60 --> 2119.60]  Because I'd be just laying along the top of the stairs with a keyboard and mouse on the
[2119.60 --> 2122.86]  floor at the top of the stairs and a server or two in the hallway.
[2123.32 --> 2129.24]  And I know there's more than one person with a scar on their leg from hitting the edges
[2129.24 --> 2130.30]  of the ear mounts.
[2130.38 --> 2131.50]  Yeah, Burkle's waving at us.
[2131.56 --> 2131.76]  Yeah.
[2131.92 --> 2133.38]  From those servers in the hallway.
[2133.60 --> 2139.10]  So that was the big thing is there was a lot of skepticism from the rest of the team
[2139.10 --> 2140.84]  about the move.
[2140.84 --> 2145.98]  Not about that it would be good, but about that we would be able to keep it tidy and
[2145.98 --> 2148.36]  about that it would change so much.
[2149.04 --> 2154.22]  And I think maintaining the tidier workspace is a big part of what changed people's positivity
[2154.22 --> 2160.68]  and changed people's attitudes and changed people's just general state of being.
[2161.36 --> 2165.80]  And while I did have to be a bit of a jerk about things for quite a while.
[2165.82 --> 2166.52]  You've lessened up now.
[2166.86 --> 2169.62]  Well, that's because a lot of people have fixed a lot of habits already.
[2169.62 --> 2171.14]  There's no more.
[2171.32 --> 2178.72]  I mean, this was one of your laying down the law things was people were leaving pee spots
[2178.72 --> 2179.94]  next to the toilet.
[2181.02 --> 2182.66]  Oh, the things I was angry about.
[2182.66 --> 2182.90]  Yeah.
[2183.02 --> 2183.28]  Okay.
[2183.32 --> 2184.62]  I was like, what the hell, dude?
[2185.32 --> 2185.96]  No, no.
[2186.00 --> 2186.18]  Yeah.
[2186.38 --> 2189.60]  So he sends out this irate email like, guys, this ain't kindergarten.
[2189.96 --> 2190.74]  It's gross.
[2190.74 --> 2194.76]  If there's a drop of pee that falls off the end of your penis.
[2194.88 --> 2195.34]  Deal with it.
[2195.36 --> 2196.16]  Then you wipe it.
[2196.32 --> 2196.68]  I don't want to deal with it.
[2196.68 --> 2197.50]  You know, you wipe it.
[2197.62 --> 2199.06]  You take that toilet paper.
[2199.18 --> 2200.14]  You put that in the toilet.
[2200.52 --> 2202.14]  So I was like, okay, that's it.
[2202.86 --> 2208.18]  If anyone catches anyone else, if anyone sees a pee spot on the floor, you tell me the time.
[2209.00 --> 2212.72]  And I will look up on the surveillance system who the last person to go into that bathroom
[2212.72 --> 2213.08]  was.
[2213.08 --> 2216.80]  So if you see it, you better report it unless you're going to clean it.
[2216.96 --> 2217.82]  And it stopped.
[2217.86 --> 2218.78]  And it was done.
[2218.98 --> 2221.16]  Actually, one occurred.
[2221.36 --> 2222.38]  But I dealt with it privately.
[2222.60 --> 2222.82]  Okay.
[2223.32 --> 2223.58]  Okay.
[2223.88 --> 2224.38]  There you go.
[2224.62 --> 2224.90]  All right.
[2225.24 --> 2227.38]  So that behavior was gone.
[2228.48 --> 2229.18]  All right.
[2229.44 --> 2230.64]  I never saw it again.
[2230.80 --> 2233.00]  So in terms of my side, it was good.
[2233.00 --> 2234.44]  Twitch chat's like, lick it up.
[2234.50 --> 2235.24]  Thanks, Twitch chat.
[2235.44 --> 2235.98]  Oh, gross.
[2236.18 --> 2236.62]  Ew.
[2237.02 --> 2240.24]  So that, I think for me, that's the biggest thing is the shift.
[2240.24 --> 2242.64]  Having a kitchen that isn't a set is actually great.
[2242.64 --> 2246.70]  And having a kitchen that's not full of dirty dishes because everyone's dishes are labeled
[2246.70 --> 2249.90]  and you know exactly because everyone's like, not me, not me, not me.
[2250.18 --> 2252.66]  Well, this spoon says BL on it.
[2253.02 --> 2258.42]  So we either have a Bunton Liu or it's Brandon Lee.
[2258.76 --> 2259.70]  Or someone stole it.
[2259.72 --> 2261.10]  But then security footage.
[2261.20 --> 2261.88]  That's right.
[2261.94 --> 2262.44]  That's right.
[2262.52 --> 2263.46]  That's a serious.
[2263.68 --> 2263.98]  People are like.
[2264.00 --> 2265.60]  So then people don't want to steal it because security footage.
[2265.62 --> 2267.54]  People are like, Linus should be a kindergarten teacher.
[2267.68 --> 2270.08]  Honestly, I feel like a kindergarten teacher sometimes.
[2270.08 --> 2277.60]  There is so much more to running a business than just barking orders and like making the
[2277.60 --> 2278.10]  videos.
[2278.58 --> 2282.56]  There's like putting, putting policies in place is one thing.
[2282.56 --> 2286.28]  And then actually enforcing policies and is an entirely different one.
[2286.30 --> 2288.22]  And it's like a constant battle.
[2288.22 --> 2294.20]  Like we got some Bose QC15 headphones for some people who requested noise canceling headphones
[2294.20 --> 2300.42]  for their workstations and literally not one of the four of them was entered into the inventory
[2300.42 --> 2301.38]  system correctly.
[2301.72 --> 2306.76]  They were all under PC headsets and only two of them had serial numbers entered for them.
[2307.02 --> 2310.48]  I entered my serial number and mine was under PC headsets because all the other ones were.
[2311.04 --> 2314.16]  So anyway, I fixed them.
[2314.16 --> 2317.18]  I even, I was entering it with someone.
[2317.38 --> 2318.20]  I think it was Brandon.
[2318.30 --> 2320.02]  I remember going like, this isn't a headset.
[2320.90 --> 2322.66]  It's under CE headphones.
[2323.18 --> 2326.54]  Cause headphones are not, they're not peripherals.
[2326.66 --> 2328.64]  So we made a decision to divide them.
[2328.64 --> 2329.50]  How are they not peripherals?
[2329.62 --> 2330.50]  Because they're not.
[2330.90 --> 2332.30]  They're a consumer electronics device.
[2332.40 --> 2333.22]  It's not a peripheral.
[2333.62 --> 2334.54]  How is it not a peripheral?
[2334.54 --> 2338.30]  Because normally you would, cause when the peripherals are PC peripherals, they're computer
[2338.30 --> 2338.86]  peripherals.
[2338.86 --> 2340.46]  But it's still a peripheral.
[2340.82 --> 2342.78]  Does it say, does it say PC peripheral?
[2343.70 --> 2344.78]  I'm actually not sure.
[2344.86 --> 2349.96]  Anyway, I don't know if you were on the committee, but we made a group decision when we, when we
[2349.96 --> 2354.54]  changed it because the thing too is I needed them separated somehow because if I'm looking
[2354.54 --> 2357.26]  for headphones, I'm not looking for headsets and vice versa.
[2357.54 --> 2357.64]  Yeah.
[2357.82 --> 2360.00]  So headphones are under consumer electronics.
[2360.34 --> 2360.54]  Yeah.
[2360.64 --> 2362.28]  And headsets are under peripherals.
[2362.28 --> 2363.60]  I didn't know what CE stood for.
[2364.02 --> 2364.38]  Okay.
[2364.62 --> 2365.60]  I thought it was closed ear.
[2366.48 --> 2366.88]  Okay.
[2366.88 --> 2367.00]  Okay.
[2367.52 --> 2368.88]  That's a good guess, but no.
[2369.30 --> 2371.48]  So, so yeah, so it's under consumer electronics.
[2371.56 --> 2372.68]  Why would you make that a category?
[2374.44 --> 2376.14]  It makes so much more sense.
[2376.90 --> 2378.56]  So it's little things like that.
[2378.82 --> 2382.40]  You know, fighting those uphill battles, you know, keeping the garbage under control.
[2382.40 --> 2385.44]  But the good news is that everyone continues to improve.
[2385.44 --> 2389.50]  And I think part of it is out of respect for this thing that we earned.
[2390.34 --> 2395.46]  Because, you know, with your help, with partners like YouTube and Vessel and, you know, I think
[2395.46 --> 2396.42]  I'm wearing a Squarespace shirt.
[2396.50 --> 2396.82]  No, I'm not.
[2396.90 --> 2398.26]  But like Squarespace.
[2398.56 --> 2399.20]  Build it beautiful.
[2399.32 --> 2399.46]  Yeah.
[2399.76 --> 2400.76]  All those things.
[2400.86 --> 2401.30]  Like that.
[2401.46 --> 2406.54]  We earned this workspace that is so much happier and more pleasant and cleaner to work in.
[2406.86 --> 2409.96]  And so I think people genuinely want to improve it.
[2410.00 --> 2411.44]  So I think that's where that comes from.
[2411.64 --> 2414.16]  Also me cracking the whip and Luke sending out angry emails.
[2414.44 --> 2415.36]  I've done a few of those.
[2415.40 --> 2417.70]  It's gotten to the point where I get to send happy emails, though.
[2417.82 --> 2420.30]  The other day, I don't remember if I actually sent the email.
[2420.30 --> 2421.10]  My phone might have died.
[2421.20 --> 2421.30]  Yeah.
[2421.44 --> 2421.94]  The shoe rack email might have died.
[2421.94 --> 2422.64]  Did I send the picture?
[2422.84 --> 2422.96]  Yeah.
[2423.06 --> 2423.38]  Okay.
[2423.48 --> 2423.74]  Okay.
[2423.80 --> 2425.96]  So I took a picture of the shoe rack at the front door.
[2426.50 --> 2430.18]  And I'm like, this makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside or something like that.
[2430.28 --> 2431.02]  Because all the shoes were on the rack.
[2431.04 --> 2436.38]  All the shoes were tidally side by side on the rack except one pair, which was under the
[2436.38 --> 2438.26]  rack, but tucked in under the rack.
[2438.44 --> 2439.52]  Tucked in under the rack is fine.
[2439.54 --> 2440.32]  I'm cool with that.
[2440.40 --> 2440.56]  Yeah.
[2440.66 --> 2441.36]  I'm cool with that.
[2441.72 --> 2445.56]  Because there was a few weeks earlier where I took a photo and there was literally the
[2445.56 --> 2447.40]  entire entranceway was just covered in shoes.
[2447.40 --> 2448.44]  And it's like, it's one of those.
[2448.98 --> 2449.38]  Ridiculous.
[2449.38 --> 2453.02]  It's like, literally, it looks like sometimes, and they weren't even like next to each other.
[2453.16 --> 2456.74]  It would look like people just kicked their shoes off in the direction of the rack and
[2456.74 --> 2457.20]  like hit it.
[2457.30 --> 2458.38]  Well, I think that's what happened.
[2458.54 --> 2461.78]  And then I think people would just get frustrated that there were so many shoes that they just
[2461.78 --> 2462.54]  walked through it.
[2462.98 --> 2467.00]  So like, not only were they randomly distributed, but then they were kicked around.
[2467.52 --> 2469.90]  It's like, please don't.
[2470.36 --> 2473.18]  There's a rack like a foot away from where it was.
[2473.18 --> 2477.96]  I think the other big thing that happened this year was the shift from Linus Tech Tips
[2477.96 --> 2486.16]  being a show where, from being a YouTube channel where Linus gives you tips and reviews about
[2486.16 --> 2491.38]  tech to being one where really there could be any number of different people.
[2491.60 --> 2494.72]  Brandon and Taryn both hosted their first videos this year.
[2494.78 --> 2495.82]  I believe Ed did as well.
[2495.82 --> 2500.52]  Luke has become a more prominent player in the lineup, meaning that we actually have
[2500.52 --> 2503.84]  five hosts, some of which don't show up that often.
[2504.28 --> 2508.56]  But we have five hosts that you might expect to appear on Linus Tech Tips.
[2508.64 --> 2514.52]  So it's becoming less about Linus and more about the Linus Tech Tips brand, which is great.
[2514.64 --> 2515.80]  That's a really positive change.
[2515.86 --> 2521.06]  And the other thing that happened is it stopped being just reviews and turned into what we call
[2521.06 --> 2525.46]  more of a show format where it can be about what we do.
[2526.34 --> 2527.14]  I'm really excited.
[2527.50 --> 2531.16]  Both people that have been on so far, I've brought up the one that we shot a little bit
[2531.16 --> 2535.28]  ago and will be going up in 10 hours or if you're watching the archive, yesterday.
[2535.86 --> 2536.22]  Yep.
[2536.30 --> 2538.58]  And this will be a simultaneous release on Vessel and YouTube.
[2538.80 --> 2539.96]  So be stoked on that.
[2540.12 --> 2541.82]  It's going to go to everyone tonight.
[2542.56 --> 2544.12]  It's sort of a Christmas special.
[2544.80 --> 2547.00]  Someone brought up too, Nicky V hosting Channel Super Fun.
[2547.12 --> 2547.44]  Yep.
[2548.14 --> 2548.82]  And that's the other thing.
[2548.82 --> 2552.32]  Channel Super Fun is no longer Linus and the LMG crew.
[2552.48 --> 2559.06]  We've actually had Mr. Nick Van Burkle take on the challenge of taking Channel Super Fun
[2559.06 --> 2562.06]  to the next level and become our primary host there.
[2562.12 --> 2566.96]  So that's, I guess, the biggest change this year is Linus Tech Tips becoming more of a
[2566.96 --> 2573.76]  show and less about just making us less reliant on what cool product there is to talk about.
[2573.78 --> 2575.62]  That's a huge deal, actually.
[2575.62 --> 2581.58]  Before, there would be dips where the channel got kind of a little boring, to be completely
[2581.58 --> 2583.74]  honest, because there wasn't interesting products coming out.
[2583.90 --> 2584.30]  Yay!
[2584.30 --> 2586.42]  Now it's like, oh, there's a dip.
[2586.82 --> 2591.44]  Let's do some really cool stuff now because we can actually take a break from the really
[2591.44 --> 2592.16]  interesting things.
[2592.20 --> 2594.72]  And because we have the resources to do it.
[2594.78 --> 2596.02]  I mean, that's another thing, too.
[2596.14 --> 2597.60]  Our headcount grew by what?
[2597.66 --> 2598.52]  Like four this year?
[2598.52 --> 2601.76]  Dennis John Colton.
[2602.48 --> 2603.44]  John Colton.
[2603.90 --> 2605.46]  Well, Yvonne's joining us.
[2606.26 --> 2607.12]  Technically next year.
[2607.24 --> 2608.48]  Technically January 1st.
[2608.52 --> 2609.26]  So, okay, fine.
[2609.34 --> 2609.90]  I'll give you that.
[2610.18 --> 2613.24]  So we added three people this year, which is bananas, right?
[2614.12 --> 2615.40]  Did Burkle get added this year?
[2615.52 --> 2615.70]  No.
[2615.86 --> 2616.66]  Late last year.
[2617.16 --> 2618.30]  Very late last year.
[2618.40 --> 2619.98]  So he's basically new this year.
[2620.10 --> 2620.34]  Okay.
[2621.44 --> 2622.00]  That's fair.
[2622.00 --> 2626.50]  So, yeah, we just have so many more resources to do what we need to do.
[2626.56 --> 2631.50]  So that's the exciting thing, is Linus Media Group being less about Linus and more about
[2631.50 --> 2634.10]  media and group this year.
[2634.38 --> 2636.16]  Which doesn't mean we're going to remove the Linus.
[2636.90 --> 2638.18]  Still going to be the first word?
[2639.14 --> 2639.46]  You know?
[2639.86 --> 2641.58]  It's kind of like peeing on the fence, right?
[2641.74 --> 2643.24]  Like territory marking.
[2643.84 --> 2646.10]  I have to put my name on the building.
[2646.22 --> 2647.24]  And on your computer.
[2647.48 --> 2648.60]  And on my computer and on the shirt.
[2648.66 --> 2649.06]  Okay.
[2649.20 --> 2649.40]  Okay.
[2649.42 --> 2651.74]  The name on the computer was not actually my doing.
[2652.00 --> 2655.16]  That airbrush job on my personal rig.
[2655.22 --> 2657.10]  By the way, personal rig update is coming.
[2657.22 --> 2658.50]  It was supposed to be this Sunday.
[2658.82 --> 2660.82]  But Canada Customs.
[2660.82 --> 2661.48]  It looks better in low light.
[2661.52 --> 2662.54]  Has some of my components.
[2662.68 --> 2662.80]  Yeah.
[2662.92 --> 2663.46]  It looks great.
[2664.18 --> 2665.74]  So that was actually done by our neighbor.
[2666.16 --> 2669.30]  And he asks me, do you want the name on the front?
[2669.42 --> 2670.30]  Because I can take that off.
[2670.34 --> 2672.92]  And I'm just like, it seems like a lot of work for him.
[2672.96 --> 2674.56]  He had already clear-coded it and everything.
[2674.72 --> 2675.90]  He was saying he could take it off.
[2675.92 --> 2677.54]  But I'm like, dude, I don't want you to do that.
[2677.56 --> 2677.96]  It's okay.
[2678.32 --> 2678.68]  It's okay.
[2678.68 --> 2679.96]  And besides, you know what?
[2679.96 --> 2682.52]  I don't mind it.
[2683.12 --> 2683.78]  Of course you don't.
[2683.80 --> 2686.60]  And most of Twitter, actually, most people said to leave it.
[2686.86 --> 2691.04]  The people who didn't say to completely change the design altogether said to leave the name.
[2691.16 --> 2692.04]  I don't really like it.
[2692.48 --> 2693.00]  Yeah, that's okay.
[2693.00 --> 2694.16]  I think he did a good job.
[2694.32 --> 2694.58]  But I don't really.
[2694.62 --> 2695.80]  I like your wife's.
[2695.94 --> 2697.06]  Oh, you've seen Yvonne's?
[2697.06 --> 2698.06]  Hers is really cool.
[2698.24 --> 2698.44]  Yeah.
[2698.44 --> 2699.22]  Do you have it here?
[2699.30 --> 2699.88]  Yeah, yeah, I do.
[2700.88 --> 2702.06]  This one's pretty sweet.
[2702.46 --> 2704.28]  So did he design both of these?
[2704.36 --> 2704.44]  Yeah.
[2704.44 --> 2705.26]  Yeah, okay.
[2705.38 --> 2706.98]  Yeah, I said I wanted blue lightning.
[2707.28 --> 2708.60]  So I got exactly what I asked for.
[2708.94 --> 2711.44]  And Yvonne said she wanted kind of like an owl thing going on.
[2711.88 --> 2714.40]  So he did like some feather kind of design-y things.
[2714.40 --> 2716.96]  And these really piercing yellow eyes that I think are fantastic.
[2716.96 --> 2718.70]  I really like that one a lot.
[2720.54 --> 2721.16]  What else?
[2723.22 --> 2724.56]  What was your lowest point?
[2725.36 --> 2725.80]  Oh, wow.
[2725.90 --> 2726.92]  Lowest point this year.
[2727.40 --> 2728.54]  I think it's an interesting conversation.
[2729.56 --> 2731.36]  The Flightness, Channel Superfund.
[2732.86 --> 2733.30]  Flightness.
[2733.32 --> 2734.68]  Was that your lowest point or Wannick?
[2735.70 --> 2736.88]  Oh, okay.
[2736.96 --> 2738.28]  So that video is coming out this weekend.
[2738.44 --> 2740.20]  So I'm not going to spoiler that.
[2740.44 --> 2742.18]  Lowest point this year.
[2743.52 --> 2745.64]  Did I go on vacation this year?
[2745.72 --> 2745.94]  Yes.
[2746.86 --> 2747.08]  Yeah.
[2747.14 --> 2748.18]  That's why I said the Flightness.
[2748.28 --> 2749.02]  That was this year.
[2749.10 --> 2749.74]  No, no, no.
[2749.80 --> 2750.54]  That was fine.
[2750.62 --> 2754.26]  That was just like I was too stressed to be low for that.
[2755.26 --> 2764.24]  No, I'd say my lowest point this year was in terms of like being really stressed and
[2764.24 --> 2770.58]  like not knowing if I can do this was the time leading up to my two and a half weeks
[2770.58 --> 2771.88]  off of vacation.
[2771.88 --> 2778.66]  I just, I, we were, we were, it was already going to be crazy because I was trying to build
[2778.66 --> 2781.78]  up enough content that I wasn't leaving these guys completely in a lurch.
[2781.88 --> 2783.32]  They'd never been without me for that long.
[2783.32 --> 2787.94]  So I was trying to bank as much content as I could so that they would have to pull as
[2787.94 --> 2791.68]  few 12 hour, you know, 14 hour days as possible while I was gone.
[2791.80 --> 2793.04]  And then the vessel launch happened.
[2793.28 --> 2794.54]  And then the vessel launch happened.
[2794.66 --> 2795.44]  We just did that anyways.
[2795.44 --> 2801.14]  So we had to do a full, we found out shortly before I left that we were going to have to
[2801.14 --> 2804.26]  do a full additional week of buffer.
[2805.06 --> 2808.92]  And that just about, just about took me down.
[2809.12 --> 2815.46]  Like I was, and we were in that old cramped, dirty office and just, yeah.
[2815.50 --> 2815.88]  You know what?
[2815.92 --> 2817.94]  That's actually, that's probably, no, no.
[2817.94 --> 2819.54]  I have a new lower lowest point for the year.
[2819.66 --> 2826.86]  I think the lowest point of the year for me was each time I found out from the construction
[2826.86 --> 2833.24]  company that we were delayed another three weeks or another two weeks or another month
[2833.24 --> 2834.02]  to move into this place.
[2834.08 --> 2837.56]  I mean, we had possession of this place for months before we moved in.
[2837.66 --> 2843.28]  They were supposed to start construction actually before we got the building permit because
[2843.28 --> 2846.16]  we know the code inside and out so we can get started.
[2846.16 --> 2846.98]  No problem.
[2847.10 --> 2849.30]  It turns out they didn't do anything until they had permits.
[2849.40 --> 2850.80]  It was a complete and outright lie.
[2852.82 --> 2858.08]  And like trying to, trying to keep other people up about, hey, we're moving soon.
[2858.14 --> 2858.54]  We're moving soon.
[2858.62 --> 2859.74]  I know this is really hard right now.
[2859.82 --> 2860.86]  I know we have no space.
[2861.18 --> 2865.36]  I know that like you have to climb over piles of debris to get to your desk.
[2866.64 --> 2875.60]  And, and me myself being just extremely frustrated and, and yeah, knowing that even when we
[2875.60 --> 2879.26]  finally could move in, it was going to be a nightmare because we were getting kicked out
[2879.26 --> 2880.64]  of our old place.
[2880.64 --> 2884.26]  We had neighbors call the city and tell them that we were running a business out of the
[2884.26 --> 2885.96]  property, which you're technically not allowed to do.
[2886.00 --> 2887.26]  And we had too much part.
[2887.38 --> 2891.74]  Uh, I think you can run one to a certain degree, but we were well above.
[2891.74 --> 2893.08]  We were well over the limit.
[2893.44 --> 2898.26]  And, uh, so having all that stress and being told, you know, it's delayed, it's delayed,
[2898.32 --> 2898.68]  it's delayed.
[2898.74 --> 2900.04]  I'm like, look, I have to get out of here.
[2900.08 --> 2904.56]  So we had to move in before the place was even done, which made it so much more time consuming
[2904.56 --> 2905.84]  and so much more stressful.
[2906.52 --> 2909.02]  Um, so I think that was the hardest part of this year.
[2909.90 --> 2910.56]  There you go.
[2910.78 --> 2911.02]  Yeah.
[2911.24 --> 2912.56]  Anything else you want to bring up for this year?
[2912.62 --> 2913.66]  Should we cycle someone else in?
[2913.70 --> 2914.70]  Let's let someone else in.
[2914.72 --> 2915.86]  I'm on the WAN show all the time.
[2916.00 --> 2916.16]  Yeah.
[2916.28 --> 2916.64]  Okay.
[2916.76 --> 2917.14]  Sounds good.
[2917.14 --> 2919.80]  You want to grab someone from the editing room?
[2919.90 --> 2923.02]  I think Taryn and Ed are both way too swamped, so maybe Dennis or John.
[2924.96 --> 2925.82]  I'm thinking John.
[2925.92 --> 2926.18]  John?
[2926.38 --> 2927.16]  One of our newbies.
[2927.48 --> 2927.82]  Yeah.
[2928.00 --> 2929.10]  Well, Dennis is a newbie, too.
[2929.10 --> 2930.56]  Hey, you're on.
[2932.00 --> 2933.36]  Uh, no, you have to go on my show.
[2933.56 --> 2933.68]  Okay.
[2934.20 --> 2937.26]  Uh, we're going to be on my show if it's something that's public.
[2937.72 --> 2938.40]  I'll go on right now.
[2938.56 --> 2938.92]  Okay.
[2939.20 --> 2939.70]  Rock on.
[2939.76 --> 2940.66]  Oh, your headphone hair.
[2940.86 --> 2941.18]  What's that?
[2941.28 --> 2941.76]  It's fine.
[2941.82 --> 2942.00]  Whatever.
[2942.30 --> 2942.78]  It's fine.
[2942.86 --> 2943.72]  They'll have to deal with it.
[2943.84 --> 2945.18]  So guys, this is John.
[2945.28 --> 2946.32]  You've probably seen him.
[2946.34 --> 2946.72]  There's a camera.
[2946.72 --> 2946.96]  Yeah.
[2946.96 --> 2948.56]  On, uh, Channel Super Fun?
[2948.92 --> 2950.14]  What Channel Super Fun have you been on?
[2950.48 --> 2951.78]  Um, I was on Pizza Darts.
[2951.98 --> 2952.50]  I was on.
[2952.50 --> 2952.94]  Pizza Darts.
[2953.16 --> 2956.28]  Um, we did the, the trampoline dodgeball.
[2956.48 --> 2956.72]  Yeah.
[2956.92 --> 2957.40]  That was awesome.
[2957.40 --> 2958.52]  That was my favorite one, I think.
[2958.52 --> 2959.04]  That was awesome.
[2959.30 --> 2959.52]  Okay.
[2959.60 --> 2963.86]  So you haven't been with us for a super long time, but you saw the old office.
[2963.86 --> 2966.96]  You saw the entire progress of the new office, basically.
[2967.54 --> 2974.60]  Um, John, for you guys' information, is basically responsible for more or less all of the writing on TechWiki.
[2975.16 --> 2975.36]  Yeah.
[2975.50 --> 2976.14]  The vast majority.
[2976.14 --> 2976.42]  Yeah.
[2976.42 --> 2978.22]  The vast majority of all the writing on TechWiki.
[2978.40 --> 2986.46]  So if you guys are a fan of what has been going on on TechWiki lately, which has been a resurgence to a certain degree, um, there you go.
[2986.56 --> 2987.16]  That's John.
[2987.26 --> 2990.92]  What are your, basically what we're talking about is what were your favorite things that happened this year?
[2991.12 --> 2993.48]  What were the lowest points of this year?
[2993.56 --> 2994.84]  What were the highest points of this year?
[2995.24 --> 2997.04]  Um, in basically any realm?
[2997.04 --> 2997.94]  Okay.
[2997.94 --> 2998.00]  Okay.
[2998.54 --> 3001.82]  Probably the high point was walking in here to the new office.
[3002.00 --> 3005.36]  It was probably, what, maybe a month and a half after we moved in.
[3005.50 --> 3005.66]  Yeah.
[3005.66 --> 3010.08]  And there was the big Linus Media Group sign in the front atrium.
[3010.22 --> 3012.20]  I was like, oh man, it's like we're a real company now.
[3012.66 --> 3012.84]  You know?
[3013.16 --> 3019.06]  So, oh, um, no, but really, uh, well, that might have been it.
[3019.12 --> 3019.42]  I don't know.
[3019.66 --> 3020.16]  That's fair.
[3020.26 --> 3020.56]  That's fair.
[3020.56 --> 3021.58]  Probably the worst thing.
[3021.58 --> 3022.12]  That was a cool moment.
[3022.26 --> 3026.62]  Probably the worst thing that happened to me this year other than spamming, I don't know
[3026.62 --> 3029.20]  how many hundreds of thousands of people on Twitter accidentally.
[3029.50 --> 3030.24]  Sorry, again.
[3031.44 --> 3039.72]  Um, so a few weeks ago, uh, Taryn's mom came by to meet everyone and I had a glass, I think
[3039.72 --> 3041.30]  it was just a glass of water or something.
[3041.30 --> 3044.50]  It was one of those cheap little Ikea glasses that Linus got us.
[3044.62 --> 3044.74]  Yeah.
[3044.90 --> 3045.72]  You haven't heard this yet?
[3045.84 --> 3046.56]  No, I don't think so.
[3046.58 --> 3046.80]  Okay.
[3046.94 --> 3049.92]  So Linus got everyone those little cheap Ikea glasses.
[3049.92 --> 3051.52]  Um, to decorate.
[3052.10 --> 3056.14]  So I had mine sitting on my desk and it just had water or something.
[3056.28 --> 3060.10]  Taryn's mom comes in and Taryn's like, oh, hey, John, this is my mom.
[3060.20 --> 3063.82]  I go to shake her hand and, you know, this is within five seconds of meeting her.
[3064.58 --> 3067.70]  The water cup falls over and it doesn't fall on the floor.
[3067.70 --> 3070.88]  It's sitting on the table like this and it just goes like, like that.
[3071.90 --> 3074.96]  Somehow this thing is so cheap, it just shatters.
[3075.38 --> 3076.44]  There's glass everywhere.
[3076.44 --> 3081.78]  Taryn's mom is just looking at me and I'm just like, well, that's kind of par for the
[3081.78 --> 3083.28]  course as far as what I do here.
[3083.98 --> 3088.86]  So, so, so that, that sticks out the most in my head other than the, the, the, other
[3088.86 --> 3090.00]  than the spam on Twitter.
[3090.00 --> 3090.36]  Yeah.
[3090.50 --> 3094.96]  Most people for their lowest point, I was expecting them to bring up the office robbery.
[3094.96 --> 3099.58]  Cause I remember I just watched it yesterday and I remember you seeing that the laptop
[3099.58 --> 3100.22]  was gone.
[3100.78 --> 3101.16]  The prank.
[3101.30 --> 3101.46]  Yeah.
[3101.60 --> 3101.72]  Yeah.
[3101.72 --> 3101.98]  Yeah.
[3101.98 --> 3102.26]  Yeah.
[3102.26 --> 3102.36]  Yeah.
[3102.36 --> 3106.90]  I remember you seeing that your laptop was gone and I was like, I was like panicking.
[3107.04 --> 3107.24]  Yeah.
[3107.24 --> 3108.16]  I have to change everything.
[3108.86 --> 3112.84]  I fully expected you to be like, that was my lowest point, but that is hilarious.
[3113.16 --> 3113.32]  Yeah.
[3113.32 --> 3115.48]  And I totally, yeah, that's, that's pretty cool.
[3115.80 --> 3116.00]  Yeah.
[3116.92 --> 3117.90]  What is this?
[3117.90 --> 3120.46]  Colton's not here.
[3120.54 --> 3122.40]  So I'm going to jump in with his lowest point.
[3122.88 --> 3127.12]  I'm issuing copyright strikes against our own videos twice.
[3127.30 --> 3127.72]  He did it again.
[3127.92 --> 3128.28]  Twice.
[3128.80 --> 3129.16]  What?
[3130.44 --> 3131.86]  Oh my God.
[3131.94 --> 3133.98]  That guy's got to work on his workflow, man.
[3134.44 --> 3135.68]  Oh my goodness.
[3136.24 --> 3137.64]  What's your favorite channel super fun you've written?
[3137.72 --> 3138.80]  Or not channel super fun.
[3138.88 --> 3140.50]  Favorite, uh, fastest possible you've written.
[3140.62 --> 3145.68]  Favorite fastest possible I've written probably that AMD history video.
[3146.00 --> 3146.28]  Okay.
[3146.28 --> 3148.18]  I actually learned a lot writing that thing.
[3148.38 --> 3149.62]  It got a lot of views.
[3149.88 --> 3151.32]  I worked on it a little bit with Linus.
[3151.40 --> 3155.10]  We had some fun conversations over, you know, okay, what was the most important thing?
[3155.58 --> 3160.88]  Um, you know, I think AMD has what, only like 20% of the CPU market now.
[3160.96 --> 3163.18]  I think a lot of people don't think about them, but they contribute a lot.
[3163.26 --> 3166.42]  And, you know, it was, it was fun to sort of write and teach about that.
[3166.54 --> 3167.20]  Right, right, right.
[3167.26 --> 3167.90]  That's pretty cool.
[3168.90 --> 3174.90]  Um, some, like you do a lot of the benchmarking too, which is something that a lot of people
[3174.90 --> 3176.12]  might not know when they're watching.
[3176.12 --> 3178.64]  Um, now that John's been here.
[3178.72 --> 3184.50]  A big, a big problem with my workflow a lot of time was that benchmarking takes a disproportionate
[3184.50 --> 3185.00]  amount of time.
[3185.10 --> 3189.16]  Most people don't realize how long some of these things actually take.
[3189.16 --> 3191.82]  And they're like, oh, like, why don't you guys have more videos?
[3191.92 --> 3193.70]  Or why didn't you like test way more stuff?
[3193.74 --> 3198.28]  And I'm like, because it takes a really long time sometimes.
[3198.28 --> 3201.86]  When you're dealing with a, let's say a graphics card that has not been released yet.
[3201.94 --> 3205.88]  And you're using like beta drivers that they emailed you, which are super not ready.
[3205.98 --> 3207.24]  And you have to overclock it.
[3207.28 --> 3210.78]  And the driver's just like all over the place.
[3210.90 --> 3212.36]  It can be a disaster.
[3212.72 --> 3215.60]  So John has helped a ton in that category.
[3215.70 --> 3216.80]  And it's freed up a lot of my time.
[3216.80 --> 3218.78]  You'll see that I've probably hosted more stuff.
[3219.08 --> 3220.48]  I'm on channel super fun more.
[3220.86 --> 3223.94]  Um, there, there's a new version of the forum coming.
[3225.20 --> 3225.64]  Whoa.
[3225.82 --> 3226.54]  Very exciting.
[3226.62 --> 3227.90]  Most people didn't know about that.
[3228.00 --> 3230.64]  So I've been able to spend tons more time working on that.
[3231.10 --> 3233.04]  Um, yeah.
[3233.30 --> 3238.84]  John has been like, John was the first addition to the team that helped pre-production.
[3239.48 --> 3239.96]  Yeah.
[3239.96 --> 3244.86]  So there we've, we've, from the start, we've added a bunch of camera and editors.
[3244.86 --> 3246.38]  We've added two sales guys.
[3246.64 --> 3252.02]  And then we finally added John, who's actually helped a ton with Linus and I, because Linus
[3252.02 --> 3256.96]  and I, the whole time we're like, we'll just keep making more things and hopefully everything
[3256.96 --> 3257.86]  else is fine.
[3257.86 --> 3260.06]  And we can add people to help them and we'll just hold it up.
[3260.10 --> 3261.92]  And then John's here and that helps.
[3262.06 --> 3263.44]  It's still just us three with pre-production.
[3263.58 --> 3264.66]  It's still just us three.
[3264.76 --> 3265.50]  And then that's it.
[3265.56 --> 3265.74]  Yeah.
[3265.74 --> 3269.66]  And just like Luke was saying with the benchmarking, it can, it can definitely take a while.
[3269.66 --> 3273.56]  You know, you want to do it the exact same way every time.
[3273.66 --> 3275.82]  So you're not getting unfair variance between cars.
[3276.02 --> 3278.20]  And you know, sometimes drivers don't want to cooperate.
[3279.06 --> 3280.90]  Or sometimes you get to the end of your testing.
[3281.06 --> 3282.10]  And I think you've ran into this.
[3282.26 --> 3283.58]  I've ran into this a billion times.
[3283.62 --> 3285.24]  I'm sure you've ran into this at least once by now.
[3285.46 --> 3288.64]  You get to the end of your testing and then you're like, that number is really weird.
[3290.36 --> 3291.02]  Something's wrong.
[3291.30 --> 3292.48]  I don't know what's wrong.
[3292.68 --> 3296.34]  And then you figure out like, oh, this like one thing was set incorrectly.
[3296.48 --> 3298.30]  So now you have to redo like everything.
[3298.48 --> 3298.80]  Exactly.
[3298.94 --> 3299.20]  Yeah.
[3299.32 --> 3300.24]  Oh no.
[3300.68 --> 3303.20]  Or like, what was it?
[3303.22 --> 3305.72]  The Witcher video where I told you the wrong Witcher.
[3307.76 --> 3310.92]  Oh, it was completely the wrong game.
[3311.04 --> 3312.44]  I had to learn a whole new benchmark.
[3312.68 --> 3314.36]  It was, oh man, that was such a disaster.
[3314.36 --> 3317.40]  I was like, yeah, benchmark, Crysis 1 and Witcher 1.
[3317.52 --> 3320.22]  But then the one I actually meant, which I did not say,
[3320.22 --> 3324.22]  but the one that I meant was Witcher 2 because the whole point was testing Uber sampling.
[3324.32 --> 3325.10]  I think that's how it went, right?
[3325.12 --> 3327.66]  Yeah, because Witcher 1 did not have Uber sampling at all.
[3327.78 --> 3328.54]  Witcher 2 did.
[3328.64 --> 3331.02]  And it was just, I think it ran on a completely different engine.
[3331.24 --> 3333.08]  The games were like in no way comparable.
[3333.30 --> 3334.46]  And I was just sitting here like.
[3335.78 --> 3336.42]  Oh no.
[3336.52 --> 3336.88]  Okay.
[3338.28 --> 3339.44]  That was a disaster.
[3340.16 --> 3340.38]  Yeah.
[3340.92 --> 3342.80]  Anything else important happen this year?
[3342.84 --> 3344.50]  You moved to this country.
[3344.64 --> 3345.34]  Yes, I did.
[3345.50 --> 3345.74]  Yeah.
[3345.86 --> 3347.02]  So that was pretty crazy.
[3347.02 --> 3352.42]  Yeah, which is why I have a, who's saying, yeah, I have a stupid voice slash stupid accent.
[3352.54 --> 3353.28]  That would be why.
[3353.28 --> 3354.34]  Oh, that's not stupid.
[3354.68 --> 3355.62]  Because I'm not Canadian.
[3355.74 --> 3357.22]  It's just a little bit of southern drawl.
[3357.30 --> 3357.80]  I guess.
[3359.94 --> 3360.58]  I don't know.
[3360.66 --> 3362.30]  If you're good to go, I might pull Dennis in.
[3362.98 --> 3364.20]  Or is there anything else you want to talk about?
[3364.46 --> 3365.90]  Oh, I don't know.
[3365.94 --> 3366.58]  What should I talk about?
[3367.00 --> 3371.66]  Just the whole thing is just basically, I think we did this last year too, but it was just Linus and I.
[3371.66 --> 3382.38]  Basically, it's just anything more related to the company, but it doesn't entirely have to be related to the company, that you thought was important in a positive or negative way in 2015.
[3383.24 --> 3384.38]  It's very broad.
[3384.98 --> 3387.56]  I talked a lot about the Channel Superfund stuff we've been doing.
[3388.12 --> 3391.16]  I talked about some of the bigger projects we've done on Linus Tech Diffs.
[3392.48 --> 3396.86]  Some of my clothes are permanently stained pink from painting Linus' car.
[3397.88 --> 3399.18]  Okay, that was pretty fun.
[3399.66 --> 3399.76]  Yeah.
[3399.92 --> 3400.30]  It was.
[3400.30 --> 3400.90]  I know that was a lot of fun.
[3400.90 --> 3403.56]  How long had you been working here by the time we did that?
[3403.70 --> 3404.62]  Oh, not long.
[3404.88 --> 3405.58]  Not long.
[3405.72 --> 3410.54]  I think, when did we, like, beginning of August is when we did that?
[3410.74 --> 3411.18]  I think so.
[3411.20 --> 3412.76]  It was about a month.
[3412.82 --> 3413.88]  I hadn't been here for very long.
[3413.94 --> 3417.56]  So working at a new company for about a month and then you paint your boss's car pink.
[3417.92 --> 3418.14]  Yeah.
[3418.44 --> 3418.68]  That was.
[3418.70 --> 3419.24]  Was it a weird experience?
[3420.40 --> 3425.48]  It wasn't actually that bad because I sort of knew what I was getting into.
[3425.70 --> 3429.80]  The worst part was when I spilled pink paint on Linus' driveway and I was just like.
[3429.80 --> 3433.48]  And it's like that oil paint that won't come off and I was like, well, I'm fired.
[3434.22 --> 3435.42]  Did you guys get it off?
[3436.18 --> 3437.24]  I got most of it.
[3437.30 --> 3441.18]  Yeah, I got most of it because it was just kind of sitting there and it was fresh.
[3441.52 --> 3441.72]  So, yeah.
[3441.82 --> 3443.04]  I was able to take care of it.
[3443.16 --> 3443.74]  That makes sense.
[3444.36 --> 3445.16]  That's pretty funny.
[3445.16 --> 3448.84]  I'm trying to think of other things.
[3449.16 --> 3456.84]  When Ixie sent me that pizza with oysters and, like, whatever other crap that was on it, it was actually pretty decent.
[3457.40 --> 3460.88]  And then Taryn was just like, what the hell are you doing?
[3461.10 --> 3462.54]  It was the worst thing.
[3462.94 --> 3464.68]  So disgusting.
[3464.68 --> 3465.26]  Oh, man.
[3465.32 --> 3467.20]  It looked and smelled gross.
[3467.38 --> 3469.74]  I know you liked it and that's awesome because at least it got.
[3469.74 --> 3471.88]  It was a little too salty, but it was palatable.
[3472.24 --> 3472.78]  I'll say that.
[3472.86 --> 3473.30]  It was palatable.
[3473.76 --> 3473.96]  Right, right.
[3474.16 --> 3474.50]  It was.
[3474.72 --> 3477.60]  I, like, I couldn't even breathe it in and be happy.
[3477.76 --> 3477.86]  Yeah.
[3477.88 --> 3479.62]  Like, there was no way I was going to be able to eat that.
[3479.96 --> 3484.50]  I just, like, looked at it and smelled it and just completely just noped right out of there.
[3484.50 --> 3486.40]  So, Ixie, if you're watching, joke's on you.
[3486.52 --> 3487.06]  It's fantastic.
[3487.26 --> 3487.76]  Thanks for the pizza.
[3488.00 --> 3488.66]  We'll see it eventually.
[3488.84 --> 3489.06]  Yeah.
[3489.32 --> 3489.90]  That's funny.
[3490.34 --> 3490.94]  I can't even remember.
[3491.04 --> 3494.62]  I think they just did, like, a coin toss to end up figuring out who got trolled by the pizza.
[3494.86 --> 3495.84]  Well, didn't it?
[3495.84 --> 3500.78]  Because it was addressed to me and Taryn and maybe Dennis.
[3500.78 --> 3505.38]  It was someone else who I think they know or knew would not like it.
[3505.74 --> 3506.90]  So, I don't know.
[3507.24 --> 3508.62]  But, yeah, that was pretty sweet.
[3509.02 --> 3509.88]  So, yeah.
[3510.86 --> 3511.26]  Cool.
[3511.42 --> 3511.94]  Anything else?
[3513.14 --> 3514.04]  I don't want a hog.
[3514.04 --> 3514.74]  Oh, that's cool.
[3514.82 --> 3515.00]  Yeah.
[3515.12 --> 3516.80]  I'm probably going to be ending pretty soon anyway.
[3516.80 --> 3517.26]  Okay, sure.
[3517.42 --> 3517.98]  So, we should.
[3518.38 --> 3519.42]  Yeah, where's Big Money?
[3519.54 --> 3520.34]  Is he still in the editing game?
[3520.36 --> 3521.08]  He's probably in there.
[3521.12 --> 3521.76]  You want to grab him?
[3522.06 --> 3522.94]  Yes, I'll grab him.
[3523.08 --> 3523.40]  Awesome.
[3523.44 --> 3524.04]  Thank you very much.
[3524.06 --> 3524.94]  Thanks for watching Wancho.
[3525.52 --> 3525.84]  Yes.
[3527.00 --> 3536.12]  If you guys have any questions for, as John calls him, Big Money or Dennis, let me know
[3536.12 --> 3536.74]  in Twitch chat.
[3536.80 --> 3538.74]  I have been kind of somewhat watching you guys.
[3541.92 --> 3542.40]  Oh, yeah.
[3542.42 --> 3543.44]  I got to do Burkle, too.
[3543.44 --> 3545.56]  I should just do Dennis and Burkle at the same time.
[3546.66 --> 3551.12]  Make sure you get Dennis to tell you about why I call him Big Money.
[3551.42 --> 3551.72]  Okay.
[3551.84 --> 3552.42]  Do you know the story?
[3552.52 --> 3553.02]  I do not.
[3553.44 --> 3554.32]  The Ethernet cable?
[3554.80 --> 3555.72]  I have no idea.
[3557.90 --> 3558.32]  Don't trip.
[3558.62 --> 3559.02]  Don't trip.
[3559.32 --> 3559.80]  There we go.
[3560.46 --> 3564.18]  I was really worried about that one because that camera would have bowled right over if
[3564.18 --> 3564.58]  he tripped.
[3565.44 --> 3565.88]  Wow.
[3565.88 --> 3566.56]  Okay.
[3566.56 --> 3566.58]  Okay.
[3566.68 --> 3567.74]  First question, Dennis.
[3568.10 --> 3569.40]  Why does John call you Big Money?
[3569.98 --> 3570.76]  I don't know.
[3571.02 --> 3571.52]  You don't know?
[3571.68 --> 3572.52]  I really don't know.
[3572.78 --> 3573.00]  He just...
[3573.00 --> 3574.64]  He said something about an Ethernet cable.
[3574.64 --> 3575.64]  Oh.
[3577.02 --> 3577.46]  Okay.
[3577.46 --> 3578.52]  I bought the...
[3578.52 --> 3582.54]  So I bought the internet cable from Best Buy.
[3582.60 --> 3583.02]  Oh.
[3583.62 --> 3584.36]  It was $40.
[3584.74 --> 3587.42]  $40 for an Ethernet cable.
[3588.70 --> 3589.06]  Yeah.
[3589.26 --> 3589.64]  This is cool.
[3589.76 --> 3591.00]  I've never been on here.
[3591.04 --> 3591.72]  You've never been on the show?
[3591.86 --> 3592.02]  No.
[3592.02 --> 3593.10]  So you can see right here.
[3593.24 --> 3593.88]  That's live.
[3593.88 --> 3594.20]  Yeah, I can see the comment.
[3594.24 --> 3595.62]  So everyone's commenting right now.
[3595.72 --> 3596.68]  You can see people that...
[3596.68 --> 3597.70]  See your face?
[3597.74 --> 3598.00]  Yeah.
[3598.36 --> 3598.64]  Yeah.
[3598.92 --> 3600.72]  So people have a little icon of your face.
[3600.90 --> 3600.98]  Wow.
[3602.94 --> 3603.30]  Yeah.
[3603.40 --> 3610.50]  So basically what this is, is we're just discussing big important things, whether they're positive
[3610.50 --> 3612.24]  or negative, that happened this year.
[3612.60 --> 3612.88]  This...
[3612.88 --> 3613.04]  Okay.
[3613.14 --> 3613.20]  Yeah.
[3613.20 --> 3617.64]  So you joined the company, came from Taiwan after meeting myself and Brandon.
[3617.78 --> 3620.26]  Well, you already knew Brandon, but after meeting myself and Brandon over there.
[3620.26 --> 3624.34]  So yeah, what big and important happened?
[3625.24 --> 3625.86]  This year?
[3626.04 --> 3626.24]  Yeah.
[3627.76 --> 3630.50]  So, okay, start from January.
[3631.98 --> 3632.60]  Should I start from January?
[3632.62 --> 3632.80]  Okay.
[3633.02 --> 3638.30]  Well, like, it doesn't have to be strictly related to the company, but more or less, like...
[3638.30 --> 3640.30]  So I got my...
[3640.30 --> 3644.06]  I got a job right after my military service.
[3644.32 --> 3646.02]  I was working in a news station.
[3646.02 --> 3647.42]  And since...
[3647.42 --> 3648.58]  Start from January...
[3648.58 --> 3651.00]  Because I plan to move back last December.
[3651.00 --> 3654.28]  So, like, probably, like, last year, this time, I always...
[3654.28 --> 3655.12]  I'm supposed to be here.
[3655.38 --> 3655.64]  Okay.
[3655.82 --> 3658.68]  But there's some issues, so I have to stay in Taiwan.
[3658.68 --> 3662.68]  And I have to work in a news station until...
[3663.46 --> 3664.72]  Until I got...
[3664.72 --> 3665.62]  Before I got this job.
[3665.92 --> 3666.10]  Yeah.
[3666.20 --> 3666.44]  And...
[3666.44 --> 3666.52]  Yeah.
[3666.70 --> 3666.82]  Yeah.
[3667.56 --> 3668.72]  That's a really big change.
[3668.84 --> 3671.18]  And it all happened probably, like, in two weeks.
[3671.34 --> 3671.80]  Oh, my goodness.
[3671.80 --> 3676.26]  And I have to move everything from Taipei to...
[3676.26 --> 3679.44]  Back to my house in Taoyuan and move back to here.
[3680.32 --> 3682.46]  And I just...
[3682.46 --> 3683.64]  It just happened too fast.
[3683.76 --> 3686.42]  And a lot of my friends didn't even know I'm moving out.
[3688.00 --> 3688.40]  Yeah.
[3688.98 --> 3691.14]  So this is a change.
[3691.44 --> 3693.18]  There's so many big change happened.
[3693.56 --> 3693.76]  Yeah.
[3693.86 --> 3694.06]  Yeah.
[3694.06 --> 3695.00]  So you didn't...
[3695.00 --> 3697.18]  Not even everyone you knew in Taiwan knew you were leaving?
[3697.18 --> 3703.24]  Oh, some of them know, but, like, some relatives, families, they don't know.
[3703.24 --> 3703.40]  Oh, okay.
[3703.68 --> 3703.86]  Yeah.
[3704.12 --> 3704.30]  Yeah.
[3704.44 --> 3704.66]  Yeah.
[3704.84 --> 3706.26]  Because it just happened.
[3706.50 --> 3708.58]  Has that been brutal, or has everyone been cool about it?
[3709.38 --> 3711.36]  Oh, they are excited for me.
[3711.38 --> 3711.66]  Okay.
[3711.76 --> 3711.96]  Yeah.
[3712.10 --> 3713.74]  They're happy for me.
[3713.86 --> 3714.42]  That's cool.
[3714.50 --> 3714.96]  Moving here.
[3715.06 --> 3715.44]  That's cool.
[3716.20 --> 3717.18]  What about...
[3717.18 --> 3718.84]  That's a really interesting story.
[3719.04 --> 3720.68]  Uprooting from your country, John and Dennis.
[3720.84 --> 3722.36]  Both John came from the U.S.
[3722.36 --> 3726.38]  It's not actually as big of a change compared to Dennis coming straight from freaking Taiwan.
[3726.38 --> 3728.40]  You went to school here, though.
[3728.48 --> 3730.00]  Yeah, but John's never been here.
[3730.20 --> 3731.44]  No, John has never been here.
[3731.86 --> 3735.68]  Dennis went to school here with the rest of the filming and editing guys that work here.
[3735.92 --> 3740.64]  So kind of knew all those guys already, so it wasn't as probably...
[3740.64 --> 3741.06]  I don't know.
[3741.16 --> 3748.68]  It's more jarring in terms of the distance, but it's probably less jarring because John had never lived and worked here before.
[3748.94 --> 3749.10]  Yeah.
[3749.84 --> 3752.82]  What about directly related to stuff you've worked on here?
[3752.82 --> 3761.70]  It's actually have a lot more stuff we have to get done than I thought.
[3762.74 --> 3766.98]  Because when I was working in news, it was more time-consuming.
[3767.24 --> 3770.52]  I had to finish a lot of videos in probably like 30 minutes.
[3770.52 --> 3774.94]  But in here, we have more time, but we have more videos.
[3775.82 --> 3778.74]  We need to do better quality.
[3778.86 --> 3779.22]  More work for a video?
[3779.26 --> 3780.12]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3781.82 --> 3783.18]  But still, it's fun.
[3783.44 --> 3784.78]  I like...
[3784.78 --> 3789.82]  I have to shoot and edit, and I also have to involve in some videos.
[3790.64 --> 3793.08]  It's not just an editor job for me.
[3793.24 --> 3793.90]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3794.30 --> 3796.10]  What is your favorite video to be involved in?
[3796.78 --> 3797.60]  Channels for Fun.
[3797.72 --> 3798.32]  Channels for Fun?
[3798.32 --> 3798.64]  Yeah.
[3800.02 --> 3800.22]  Yeah.
[3800.70 --> 3803.58]  Did you like the bomb one, or was that unfair because you didn't really know it was...
[3803.58 --> 3806.26]  I didn't even know we were playing until last minute.
[3806.32 --> 3806.88]  Yeah, okay.
[3806.98 --> 3809.54]  So that was something I didn't know about until after the competition.
[3809.82 --> 3814.52]  I was actually confused because I was like, Dennis is usually better than those things.
[3814.86 --> 3816.36]  I was like, why does he just not get it?
[3817.16 --> 3820.02]  Okay, even now, I still don't know how to play that game.
[3820.02 --> 3820.56]  Yeah, okay.
[3820.68 --> 3826.02]  So everyone else that was participating had been told to go on YouTube and watch...
[3826.02 --> 3828.28]  Angle?
[3828.34 --> 3829.36]  Why are people complaining about the angle?
[3829.64 --> 3829.94]  Whatever.
[3830.22 --> 3836.02]  People were told to go on YouTube and watch videos of how the game was played, except for
[3836.02 --> 3836.22]  Dennis.
[3836.60 --> 3839.20]  So then we all knew how to play to a certain degree.
[3839.28 --> 3842.56]  We hadn't seen the manual yet, but we knew there was a manual, and we knew how the manual
[3842.56 --> 3844.90]  worked, and then we knew how to actually operate the game.
[3845.04 --> 3847.36]  Dennis was never told any of that.
[3847.36 --> 3851.22]  So then, is looking at this manual, like, what do I do with this?
[3851.64 --> 3855.06]  And right before doing that, I was shooting B-rolls and stuff.
[3855.18 --> 3855.36]  Yeah.
[3855.52 --> 3858.36]  And they were like, Dennis, you're in this game.
[3858.54 --> 3859.46]  I was like, what?
[3859.50 --> 3860.56]  I don't even know what we're doing.
[3860.90 --> 3861.12]  Yeah.
[3862.88 --> 3863.76]  Oh, man.
[3864.40 --> 3865.54]  Yeah, that was...
[3865.54 --> 3866.30]  But I'm not...
[3866.30 --> 3867.68]  I'm not that dumb.
[3868.48 --> 3868.80]  No.
[3869.04 --> 3870.34]  No, just didn't know what was going on.
[3870.34 --> 3870.78]  You guys know.
[3871.18 --> 3872.12]  What a jerk.
[3872.92 --> 3873.74]  That's Burkle.
[3874.14 --> 3875.50]  Constantly heckling on Dennis.
[3875.50 --> 3878.68]  What was your least favorite thing?
[3878.94 --> 3879.90]  That's a hard question.
[3880.92 --> 3888.14]  My least favorite thing is dealing one of the tripod here we have.
[3888.96 --> 3890.48]  There's a tripod I really hate.
[3890.86 --> 3893.38]  Every time I walk by, I just want to swear to it.
[3895.04 --> 3897.50]  That tripod we use for...
[3898.32 --> 3898.86]  The main?
[3898.96 --> 3899.70]  Yeah, the main one.
[3899.76 --> 3900.36]  Yeah, yeah.
[3900.36 --> 3901.98]  It's really hard to use.
[3902.84 --> 3907.28]  Even you label, it's supposed to label when the bubble's in the circle.
[3907.46 --> 3907.62]  Yeah.
[3907.70 --> 3908.28]  It's not.
[3909.26 --> 3911.46]  And I just hate that tripod so much.
[3911.58 --> 3914.68]  And every time I use it, I just go back to complain to Brandon.
[3915.14 --> 3916.32]  Brandon's like, okay, I know.
[3916.40 --> 3916.84]  I understand.
[3917.68 --> 3918.76]  I hate that tripod.
[3918.76 --> 3920.84]  That's the thing I might be reading.
[3921.20 --> 3922.04]  That's pretty funny.
[3922.98 --> 3923.68]  What was I going to bring up?
[3923.76 --> 3924.54]  How is...
[3924.54 --> 3929.78]  So one thing that you guys might not know is that we actually upload videos in China.
[3931.06 --> 3931.40]  Oh, yeah.
[3931.58 --> 3932.78]  On Billy Bee or something?
[3932.78 --> 3935.04]  We have a couple websites that are uploading.
[3935.80 --> 3936.92]  Billy Billy...
[3936.92 --> 3937.64]  Billy Billy.
[3939.04 --> 3939.86]  Too tall.
[3940.26 --> 3940.60]  Too tall.
[3941.82 --> 3942.78]  Some other two.
[3942.90 --> 3943.58]  I cannot forget.
[3943.84 --> 3944.12]  That's funny.
[3944.12 --> 3945.00]  Because we have four.
[3945.38 --> 3945.48]  Yeah.
[3945.74 --> 3950.34]  And so basically, every morning, I give them the script.
[3950.58 --> 3951.30]  And so they translate.
[3951.52 --> 3954.34]  I have to export China version for them.
[3954.86 --> 3956.08]  Nick, can you stop?
[3957.86 --> 3959.76]  So yeah, that's basically what I do.
[3960.36 --> 3962.46]  I work with some Chinese people.
[3962.78 --> 3963.00]  Yeah.
[3963.36 --> 3969.74]  So basically, he uploads a Chinese version of the video and a script to them.
[3969.74 --> 3971.74]  Then they translate off of the script.
[3971.74 --> 3977.00]  These guys, I think, were the same guys who had been doing it kind of the getaway before,
[3977.14 --> 3979.66]  where they were listening to it and then translating it, which is rough.
[3980.10 --> 3982.06]  So now we give them actually our raw scripts.
[3982.26 --> 3985.48]  They translate it from that and then upload it with professional subtitles.
[3985.68 --> 3990.46]  But sometimes, if they don't understand some words, they will probably ask me some slings.
[3990.58 --> 3990.80]  Right.
[3991.12 --> 3991.86]  Like, dang.
[3993.78 --> 3996.74]  Like, Nick always says some weird words that I don't understand.
[3997.04 --> 3998.30]  Do we upload Channel Super Fun over there?
[3998.62 --> 4000.18]  No, but like, moving log.
[4000.18 --> 4001.80]  Oh, okay.
[4001.94 --> 4002.60]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4002.80 --> 4004.58]  So they ask me if I don't understand.
[4005.50 --> 4006.58]  Sometimes I don't understand either.
[4006.68 --> 4007.58]  I have to ask you guys.
[4007.90 --> 4008.08]  Yeah.
[4008.26 --> 4008.50]  Yeah.
[4008.70 --> 4009.16]  That makes sense.
[4010.04 --> 4012.24]  Is there anything else you want to bring up or I might cycle Berkow in?
[4012.72 --> 4014.28]  We don't have a ton of time left.
[4014.52 --> 4016.36]  But if there's anything else you want to talk about, that's super cool.
[4017.46 --> 4018.98]  Is there anything else important that happened this year?
[4018.98 --> 4021.98]  Not really.
[4022.38 --> 4023.52]  Oh, I've been moving.
[4023.68 --> 4024.60]  Oh, I got, oh, yeah.
[4025.04 --> 4025.74]  I've been moving.
[4026.16 --> 4027.84]  How many times I've moved this year?
[4028.12 --> 4029.84]  Four times, five times.
[4030.08 --> 4034.68]  From Taipei, Taoyuan, and Taiwan to here.
[4034.68 --> 4040.02]  And I live at Nick's parents' house for the first probably a week or two.
[4040.52 --> 4042.94]  I moved to another house and I moved to Nick's house.
[4043.40 --> 4045.16]  And now I moved to my house.
[4046.30 --> 4049.88]  And I got my first car in my life.
[4049.88 --> 4052.22]  And I got the first mattress in my life.
[4052.76 --> 4053.96]  My own mattress.
[4054.92 --> 4057.54]  And what else happened this year?
[4060.34 --> 4060.88]  I got my first car.
[4060.88 --> 4063.58]  Is it weird having your own place and your own car and all that stuff?
[4063.82 --> 4065.96]  I used to live by my own in Taiwan.
[4066.40 --> 4066.66]  Okay.
[4067.10 --> 4068.18]  But it's cool.
[4068.40 --> 4070.66]  I never had a big place by my own.
[4070.92 --> 4071.54]  And it's fun.
[4071.82 --> 4073.20]  It's good to have my own car.
[4073.66 --> 4075.62]  Because you cannot live without a car in Canada.
[4076.16 --> 4076.60]  Basically.
[4076.60 --> 4080.98]  Because like first couple, like probably first, oh no, first month.
[4081.24 --> 4083.52]  First month and a half, I didn't even have a car.
[4083.94 --> 4087.98]  And I had to use Nick to drive me around to do grocery.
[4088.64 --> 4089.12]  Yeah.
[4089.36 --> 4090.86]  It was really bad.
[4091.12 --> 4091.28]  Yeah.
[4091.88 --> 4094.26]  It's good to have so many things happening this year.
[4094.48 --> 4096.98]  And it's really fun working here.
[4097.74 --> 4099.60]  It's the best job I've had so far.
[4099.76 --> 4100.40]  That's awesome.
[4100.58 --> 4101.56]  I actually feel the same.
[4102.28 --> 4103.96]  In two countries.
[4104.90 --> 4105.34]  Yes.
[4105.34 --> 4106.82]  Okay.
[4106.86 --> 4107.50]  That's pretty cool.
[4107.74 --> 4107.92]  Cool.
[4108.78 --> 4109.38]  Burkle it?
[4109.74 --> 4109.92]  Yeah.
[4110.14 --> 4110.62]  Hey, Burkle.
[4111.62 --> 4112.22]  You're up.
[4115.10 --> 4115.50]  Cool.
[4115.70 --> 4117.44]  How do we get those pictures?
[4117.86 --> 4118.38]  Those pictures?
[4119.72 --> 4123.60]  The people that have the ones of like you and Burkle and myself and all that kind of stuff.
[4123.84 --> 4125.82]  I have a Twitch channel that's partnered.
[4126.18 --> 4126.26]  Oh.
[4126.44 --> 4128.72]  So if they subscribe to my Twitch channel, then they can use us.
[4128.92 --> 4129.78]  Do we have to pay?
[4130.32 --> 4130.56]  Yeah.
[4131.44 --> 4132.38]  I'll show you one here.
[4133.08 --> 4133.98]  These are all.
[4134.18 --> 4134.58]  Oh.
[4134.58 --> 4136.22]  I'm going to be adding more.
[4136.36 --> 4137.42]  Like I want to get one of Brandon.
[4137.98 --> 4139.00]  I want to get one of Taryn.
[4139.54 --> 4141.08]  I want to get one of Colton and John.
[4141.60 --> 4142.06]  But yeah.
[4142.20 --> 4143.00]  Oh, he's coming.
[4143.44 --> 4144.16]  Hello, Burkle.
[4144.16 --> 4145.16]  What's that?
[4145.16 --> 4148.22]  What's that?
[4152.78 --> 4153.88]  Is it this shoe?
[4155.08 --> 4155.48]  Oh.
[4157.26 --> 4157.62]  Okay.
[4157.78 --> 4159.88]  So I think you probably get the gist of it at this point.
[4159.88 --> 4161.28]  I don't.
[4161.38 --> 4162.54]  I actually don't know what was that.
[4162.74 --> 4163.20]  Oh, weird.
[4163.30 --> 4166.14]  I'm seeing Nick Light and then Dennis on the screen at the same time.
[4167.06 --> 4167.84]  Oh, wow.
[4168.58 --> 4181.14]  Basically what's going on is what happened this year to you, mostly related to work, but doesn't have to be completely related to work, that was important or cool or interesting or terrible or bad or whatever.
[4181.14 --> 4182.14]  Oh.
[4183.08 --> 4184.88]  Interesting stories from 2015.
[4185.04 --> 4185.44]  2015.
[4185.44 --> 4186.20]  Roughly related to Linus.
[4186.20 --> 4186.80]  What a blur.
[4186.90 --> 4187.78]  What a quick year.
[4188.00 --> 4189.50]  You went to Germany for BMW.
[4189.84 --> 4190.28]  Oh, yeah.
[4190.68 --> 4191.86]  You went to NAB.
[4192.20 --> 4192.44]  Yeah.
[4192.62 --> 4195.00]  You basically took over Channel Super Fun.
[4195.18 --> 4195.38]  Yeah.
[4195.46 --> 4196.66]  That was probably my favorite part.
[4196.78 --> 4198.00]  There was the office move.
[4198.36 --> 4199.56]  All the office moving vlogs.
[4199.68 --> 4201.02]  Man, there's a lot of stuff.
[4201.14 --> 4201.30]  Holy.
[4201.30 --> 4202.26]  There's tons of stuff.
[4202.32 --> 4204.40]  I'm trying to weigh in on one thing, but I don't even know.
[4204.48 --> 4205.46]  There's so many things going on.
[4205.54 --> 4206.38]  You can just start firing.
[4206.72 --> 4207.00]  Okay.
[4209.36 --> 4210.16]  First fire.
[4210.56 --> 4211.18]  Let's start off.
[4211.26 --> 4212.22]  NAB last year.
[4212.78 --> 4213.18]  2015.
[4213.72 --> 4214.84]  The spark of a new year.
[4214.94 --> 4215.68]  That was pretty cool.
[4215.68 --> 4217.62]  I'd never gone to Vegas for work before.
[4218.16 --> 4218.22]  Yeah.
[4218.26 --> 4219.08]  It was a lot of fun.
[4219.30 --> 4219.46]  Yeah.
[4219.58 --> 4221.52]  A lot of work, but like super fun.
[4221.52 --> 4222.48]  Oh, you also did.
[4222.56 --> 4222.78]  Oh, no.
[4222.84 --> 4223.50]  That was technically.
[4224.18 --> 4225.38]  No, you did CES, too.
[4225.72 --> 4225.96]  Yeah.
[4225.96 --> 4226.66]  What did I say?
[4226.74 --> 4226.90]  NAB?
[4226.94 --> 4227.30]  Oh, yeah.
[4227.34 --> 4227.64]  CES.
[4227.64 --> 4228.34]  That was 2015.
[4228.42 --> 4229.34]  That's what I was actually talking about.
[4229.34 --> 4229.36]  Yeah.
[4229.36 --> 4229.56]  Okay.
[4229.70 --> 4229.90]  Yeah.
[4229.90 --> 4229.96]  Yeah.
[4229.96 --> 4230.78]  That was a lot of fun.
[4230.88 --> 4232.02]  And then doing that wine show with everyone.
[4232.36 --> 4232.60]  I don't know.
[4232.66 --> 4234.26]  That was like, holy crap.
[4234.34 --> 4234.58]  Everything.
[4234.76 --> 4236.32]  So much stuff's going on.
[4236.62 --> 4236.94]  Yeah.
[4237.02 --> 4237.64]  That, like, I don't know.
[4237.68 --> 4239.28]  Pretty much every trip has been really cool.
[4239.44 --> 4240.92]  Going to Germany, that was really cool.
[4241.32 --> 4241.92]  For like a date.
[4242.18 --> 4243.32]  Someone said, who is this?
[4243.38 --> 4245.92]  This is Nick Van Berkel, also known as Nicky V.
[4246.30 --> 4247.12]  You've probably seen him.
[4247.12 --> 4247.22]  Yeah.
[4247.22 --> 4247.58]  How are you doing?
[4247.78 --> 4249.84]  You saw him in the moving vlogs, for sure.
[4249.98 --> 4253.56]  And you've probably also seen him over on Channel Super Fun all over the place.
[4254.14 --> 4259.94]  His main job here is heading up, leading, producing, filming, hosting Channel Super Fun.
[4260.44 --> 4260.92]  Doing that.
[4261.16 --> 4261.36]  Yeah.
[4262.10 --> 4263.58]  You know what's funny?
[4263.68 --> 4265.50]  Like, I did not start off doing that here.
[4265.80 --> 4269.88]  I started off editing, like, VAPS and stuff and then doing one Channel Super Fun a week.
[4270.12 --> 4270.30]  Yeah.
[4270.42 --> 4271.50]  Co-doing it with Taryn.
[4271.50 --> 4274.20]  And then after a while, I was like, oh, I kind of like editing these.
[4274.30 --> 4275.32]  I kind of just want to do this.
[4275.32 --> 4279.28]  Let's see if I can just slide my way into just, literally just doing this channel.
[4279.42 --> 4280.78]  And now that's all I do, basically.
[4281.30 --> 4283.38]  But, you know, other stuff here and there.
[4283.60 --> 4283.82]  Yeah.
[4284.04 --> 4287.00]  But, yeah, no, that's basically my job now.
[4287.10 --> 4287.84]  Channel Super Fun.
[4287.92 --> 4288.66]  And it's a lot of fun.
[4288.74 --> 4292.32]  That's obviously the best thing about this year, is having that be my job.
[4292.54 --> 4298.02]  Because, you know, not so often can you, like, play around and goof around and make stupid editing
[4298.02 --> 4299.98]  and do, like, goofy shit.
[4300.32 --> 4303.40]  I had a buddy over yesterday who's from Kelowna.
[4303.40 --> 4306.48]  I haven't seen him in probably a year or two.
[4306.60 --> 4306.82]  Yeah.
[4307.00 --> 4308.50]  But he's, like, not into computers at all.
[4308.56 --> 4310.66]  He's just a good buddy of mine from high school and stuff.
[4310.96 --> 4313.14]  And I started showing him, like, Channel Super Fun and stuff.
[4313.20 --> 4314.78]  And he's like, how is this your job?
[4315.16 --> 4315.98]  Yeah, I don't know.
[4316.16 --> 4316.74]  I don't know, man.
[4316.78 --> 4317.20]  You know what?
[4317.30 --> 4321.08]  For as fun as it is, it makes it really hard to explain to people what you do for work.
[4321.08 --> 4324.74]  It's like, I make videos for work.
[4325.36 --> 4325.92]  What kind?
[4326.06 --> 4327.46]  Like, I don't, like, just.
[4328.44 --> 4330.92]  If I explain it, I sound like such an idiot.
[4331.02 --> 4331.76]  But it is a job.
[4332.20 --> 4334.08]  So, you know, it works.
[4334.40 --> 4335.88]  What's your favorite Channel Super Fun this year?
[4336.44 --> 4337.80]  Somebody just posted it.
[4337.84 --> 4339.10]  I liked painting the car.
[4339.52 --> 4339.68]  Yeah.
[4339.68 --> 4340.38]  I loved that.
[4340.54 --> 4342.32]  The, like, Nicky V Customs version?
[4342.38 --> 4343.68]  Well, like, I don't know.
[4343.76 --> 4346.70]  I hate editing myself because it's, like, just, I hate.
[4347.36 --> 4350.08]  But then once it's done, I, like, looking back, I'm like, oh, that's pretty funny.
[4350.20 --> 4350.60]  Yeah, yeah.
[4350.72 --> 4352.42]  During the thick of it, I'm like, man, this sucks.
[4352.46 --> 4353.08]  This is brutal.
[4353.56 --> 4353.70]  Yeah.
[4353.72 --> 4355.82]  But the car painting, both of them were pretty good.
[4356.00 --> 4360.32]  I liked the first one because that was when we had done the car painting in the day.
[4360.96 --> 4361.82]  We ate pizza.
[4361.90 --> 4363.18]  We went back to the office.
[4363.32 --> 4365.68]  And that's when the whole fake staged robbery happened.
[4366.24 --> 4367.22]  So that was intense.
[4367.30 --> 4368.00]  That was insane.
[4368.02 --> 4370.04]  Because, like, what a mind.
[4370.10 --> 4371.08]  Like, that blew my mind.
[4371.14 --> 4371.78]  I was like, what?
[4371.78 --> 4372.26]  What?
[4372.44 --> 4375.66]  Like, the office got robbed while we're painting a freaking car?
[4375.84 --> 4377.20]  Like, nobody was at the office?
[4377.42 --> 4379.28]  Like, out of all days to not be there.
[4379.28 --> 4379.64]  It's the one time.
[4379.78 --> 4379.94]  Yeah.
[4379.94 --> 4380.16]  Yeah.
[4380.20 --> 4381.88]  That prank was so good.
[4381.98 --> 4385.26]  That totally, like, totally fooled me.
[4385.66 --> 4387.66]  I've never been pranked that hard before.
[4387.78 --> 4389.90]  That was legitimate confusion.
[4390.16 --> 4391.52]  You almost murdered someone who was running down the street.
[4391.52 --> 4393.98]  Yeah, I went driving after someone that didn't exist.
[4394.20 --> 4394.30]  Yeah.
[4395.42 --> 4397.78]  I straight up got in my car and was ripping around.
[4397.78 --> 4398.98]  Like, I don't know what it would have.
[4399.32 --> 4399.98]  Like, if I had.
[4400.14 --> 4400.90]  What the hell?
[4401.78 --> 4403.14]  What a stupid tactic.
[4404.62 --> 4406.40]  If you find them, though, you could call the cops.
[4406.56 --> 4407.34]  Yeah, I guess so.
[4407.38 --> 4408.70]  Make a citizen's arrest.
[4408.98 --> 4409.24]  Yeah.
[4409.72 --> 4411.92]  But, yeah, that was pretty crazy.
[4411.96 --> 4414.44]  So I guess that kind of loops into the worst part, too.
[4414.48 --> 4415.76]  Because that was, like, stressful.
[4416.70 --> 4420.64]  And then moving into this place was pretty, like, it was nice getting.
[4420.98 --> 4424.84]  You know when it's like you do your job all the time and then you get a little break from it and it's so nice?
[4424.84 --> 4426.82]  It's like, oh, I don't have to be writing today.
[4426.90 --> 4428.08]  I'm actually moving stuff.
[4428.16 --> 4429.12]  And you're like, oh, this is fun.
[4429.26 --> 4429.44]  Yeah.
[4429.44 --> 4435.96]  And then after, like, one or two days of moving stuff, you're like, man, I really want to do my job again.
[4436.04 --> 4437.34]  This is too much.
[4437.58 --> 4437.76]  Yeah.
[4437.76 --> 4440.30]  I just realized I cannot sit still, hey?
[4440.42 --> 4442.52]  Like, I'm watching myself on here and here.
[4442.64 --> 4444.36]  I cannot, like, just stay still and participate.
[4444.36 --> 4444.70]  I do.
[4444.84 --> 4448.06]  My problem is I pump my legs and then I put my hands in my lap.
[4448.24 --> 4450.68]  So the whole chat is like, why is he fapping?
[4451.06 --> 4454.58]  Because I just sit here shaking the whole time and my hands are in my lap.
[4454.60 --> 4455.10]  Oh, I see.
[4455.10 --> 4457.86]  So then every once in a while I have to just be like, everything's fine.
[4458.32 --> 4458.60]  Wow.
[4458.74 --> 4459.26]  Everything's fine.
[4459.30 --> 4459.92]  I'm not doing anything.
[4460.08 --> 4461.70]  It's weird being on this show.
[4462.28 --> 4465.78]  Because you're just like, when you watch it, you're like, oh, they're talking to each other and people.
[4466.24 --> 4471.06]  But then when you're sitting here, you're like, oh, I'm just talking to a camera with a little bit of black tinfoil on it.
[4471.08 --> 4471.36]  Yeah.
[4471.92 --> 4473.60]  It looks like it can't even see us.
[4474.40 --> 4475.02]  Oh, man.
[4475.12 --> 4475.82]  It's like it's hiding.
[4476.40 --> 4477.94]  So what else do we have on this thing?
[4477.94 --> 4478.60]  What else are we doing?
[4478.66 --> 4479.64]  Do we do any cool stuff?
[4479.64 --> 4480.86]  Basically, it's just a chat.
[4481.04 --> 4481.64]  Just a chat.
[4481.74 --> 4482.26]  Just a chat.
[4482.32 --> 4483.60]  Just talking about what was important this year.
[4483.68 --> 4484.80]  It's already gone long.
[4485.10 --> 4486.34]  Has it gone too long?
[4486.92 --> 4488.46]  I don't think anyone cares.
[4489.34 --> 4490.38]  We're not really on format.
[4490.60 --> 4492.12]  I'm supposed to do sponsor spots.
[4492.46 --> 4493.36]  Let's do one right now.
[4493.60 --> 4493.88]  Okay.
[4494.26 --> 4494.60]  All right.
[4496.08 --> 4497.18]  Can I read it out?
[4497.52 --> 4497.84]  Sure.
[4498.12 --> 4498.28]  Yeah.
[4498.42 --> 4498.82]  Give me a second.
[4498.88 --> 4499.68]  They're just bullet points.
[4500.98 --> 4501.70]  Here you go.
[4501.96 --> 4502.88]  So this is lynda.com.
[4502.88 --> 4503.52]  All right.
[4503.84 --> 4505.16]  Well, thank you guys for watching.
[4505.16 --> 4507.98]  This episode today is sponsored by lynda.com.
[4508.16 --> 4511.40]  It is used by millions of people around the world, I'll have you know.
[4511.40 --> 4515.04]  And there's more than 3,000 courses available online.
[4515.12 --> 4515.82]  Let me tell you that.
[4516.18 --> 4521.24]  It does include topics like web development, photography, visual design, and you guessed
[4521.24 --> 4522.14]  it, Luke, business.
[4522.38 --> 4522.64]  Okay.
[4522.88 --> 4523.36]  All right.
[4523.42 --> 4527.60]  So we've also got software training like Excel, which literally nobody knows how to use,
[4527.68 --> 4529.10]  and they all put it on their resume.
[4529.10 --> 4529.20]  Okay.
[4529.92 --> 4531.74]  WordPress and Photoshop as well.
[4531.82 --> 4531.98]  Wow.
[4532.02 --> 4533.12]  There's a lot of text in here.
[4533.22 --> 4533.70]  Holy hell.
[4533.70 --> 4534.58]  How do you guys do this stuff?
[4535.00 --> 4537.28]  All courses are taught by industry experts.
[4538.30 --> 4538.74]  Experts?
[4538.96 --> 4539.50]  Or experts.
[4539.64 --> 4540.98]  There might be one expert.
[4541.20 --> 4541.38]  Yeah.
[4541.64 --> 4545.86]  And there's new courses added every week, so you can be learning every week.
[4546.72 --> 4547.12]  Darn.
[4548.12 --> 4552.86]  Whether you want a new set of financial goals, to find work-life balance, to invest in a
[4552.86 --> 4555.34]  new hobby, ask your boss for a raise.
[4555.40 --> 4556.34]  That's always a good one.
[4556.34 --> 4560.68]  Find a new job or improve upon current job skills that you already have.
[4561.12 --> 4563.72]  Lynda.com has something for everyone.
[4564.98 --> 4566.52]  I feel like they should have ended it there.
[4566.60 --> 4567.48]  Oh, they did kind of.
[4567.60 --> 4567.80]  Yeah.
[4568.16 --> 4573.56]  You can use a 10-day free trial, which gives you access to every course on Lynda.com.
[4573.74 --> 4575.00]  That's actually a really good job.
[4575.04 --> 4576.78]  Like, that's a pretty good thing to do.
[4577.10 --> 4581.04]  I wish I had done that before I ever started this stuff, because I could have tried out some
[4581.04 --> 4584.26]  other editing programs and been like, hmm, I don't like the one that I use.
[4584.88 --> 4586.00]  And now I know a different one.
[4586.00 --> 4589.94]  But anyways, you can use it on your phone or your iPhone or your Android.
[4590.38 --> 4592.62]  Plans start as low as $25 a month.
[4593.10 --> 4598.36]  So head over to Lynda.com slash WANshow to claim your 10-day free trial to start learning
[4598.36 --> 4598.82]  today.
[4599.36 --> 4599.88]  There you go.
[4600.16 --> 4600.78]  That was it.
[4600.96 --> 4601.78]  Yeah, that's basically it.
[4601.78 --> 4605.76]  You guys will probably have to redo that over so it's not like, they're not like phoning
[4605.76 --> 4607.66]  like, hey, that was a really stupid spot.
[4607.78 --> 4609.38]  Can you guys actually do it really serious?
[4609.38 --> 4613.18]  With WANshow stuff, though, like half the time, we just murder the spots.
[4613.38 --> 4614.98]  But people like them because they're funny.
[4615.24 --> 4615.88]  Oh, okay.
[4615.90 --> 4616.98]  So then they're like, oh.
[4617.56 --> 4618.92]  Lynda.com is cool, though.
[4618.98 --> 4619.84]  I can vouch for that.
[4620.02 --> 4620.90]  It is a cool thing.
[4620.96 --> 4623.02]  It's like going to college without having to go to college.
[4623.16 --> 4626.76]  I actively used it because we had like a company account thing.
[4626.76 --> 4631.78]  And then now I'm going to get a personal account because you can, if you complete a course,
[4631.88 --> 4633.52]  you can put that you did that on LinkedIn.
[4633.52 --> 4633.64]  Oh, yeah.
[4633.70 --> 4634.32]  Now it's LinkedIn.
[4634.82 --> 4635.46]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4635.48 --> 4636.52]  Which is just kind of cool.
[4636.72 --> 4638.08]  Like, I'm not looking for another job.
[4638.20 --> 4638.82]  No, but yeah.
[4639.04 --> 4639.60]  Look at all these things.
[4639.60 --> 4639.90]  It's legit.
[4640.12 --> 4643.14]  It's not like, oh, yeah, I went on some website and learned something.
[4643.24 --> 4644.34]  It's like built into it.
[4644.40 --> 4644.56]  Yeah.
[4644.58 --> 4646.36]  It's like, no, this is actually Lynda.com.
[4646.94 --> 4647.22]  Yeah.
[4647.32 --> 4653.38]  We also have Dollar Shave Club, which I apparently didn't use today, but you did.
[4654.24 --> 4656.02]  You can get great razors to your door.
[4656.02 --> 4659.12]  They have an executive razor that has six blades, but it doesn't have any of that crap
[4659.12 --> 4661.02]  like vibrating handles or any of that bullshit.
[4661.50 --> 4666.56]  It's only a few bucks a month directly to your door in the US, Canada, or Australia.
[4667.26 --> 4673.64]  You can also get stuff like Dr. Carver's Shave Butter or Butt Wipes for Men or just other
[4673.64 --> 4675.64]  toiletry supplies.
[4676.84 --> 4680.66]  The Dr. Carver's Shave Butter goes on clear and smells good, so you can shave through it
[4680.66 --> 4684.10]  and you can actually like see your beard so you don't shave the wrong part, which is kind
[4684.10 --> 4684.46]  of cool.
[4684.62 --> 4684.92]  Handy.
[4684.92 --> 4684.98]  Handy.
[4685.48 --> 4689.12]  Some of our community members have actually told us that their lady friends like it, so
[4689.12 --> 4690.98]  it's not just like a guy thing.
[4692.18 --> 4692.42]  Yeah.
[4692.52 --> 4695.42]  You can put it on your lady legs if you want to shave those.
[4695.48 --> 4699.10]  Or if you're a guy and you want to shave those darn legs, by all means.
[4699.40 --> 4699.64]  Yeah.
[4699.88 --> 4701.24]  Dollar Shave Club's got you covered.
[4701.36 --> 4702.14]  Go ahead, right?
[4702.28 --> 4703.82]  Like no questions asked.
[4703.94 --> 4704.10]  There.
[4704.18 --> 4705.42]  You're good to do whatever you want to do.
[4705.42 --> 4705.96]  Maybe you're a swimmer.
[4706.02 --> 4706.72]  Maybe you're not.
[4708.14 --> 4708.46]  You know?
[4708.78 --> 4709.38]  You just got to shave the...
[4709.38 --> 4711.18]  Maybe you're a swimmer or you just really like swimmers.
[4711.66 --> 4714.42]  Or you're really hairy and you're just like, you know what?
[4714.44 --> 4715.24]  I'm done with this.
[4715.92 --> 4717.84]  Your girlfriend's like, I don't like that back hair.
[4718.10 --> 4722.14]  Well, she can take it off for you with a razor from Dollar Shave Club.
[4722.14 --> 4727.84]  You can shave time, shave money, or shave your back by ordering Dollar Shave Club razors
[4727.84 --> 4730.06]  and eliminate pointless trips to the store.
[4730.36 --> 4734.20]  So to go to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus and give them a try today.
[4736.26 --> 4738.04]  Who should I get to go on this next?
[4738.78 --> 4741.48]  I think that's Colton is gone.
[4741.64 --> 4742.26]  Nick is done.
[4742.40 --> 4743.56]  Taryn and Ed are both too busy.
[4743.72 --> 4744.34]  Dennis is done.
[4744.44 --> 4744.98]  John is done.
[4745.06 --> 4745.60]  Linus is done.
[4746.04 --> 4746.36]  Wow.
[4746.44 --> 4746.88]  That's it.
[4747.14 --> 4747.42]  Yeah.
[4748.22 --> 4748.62]  Wow.
[4748.62 --> 4752.62]  I'm just looking at that picture up there of Macaulay Culkin.
[4752.74 --> 4753.28]  There you go.
[4753.44 --> 4753.88]  There you go.
[4754.10 --> 4755.30]  Is that all the important stuff this year?
[4755.74 --> 4756.54]  I think so.
[4756.70 --> 4757.20]  I don't know.
[4757.28 --> 4757.56]  What else?
[4757.68 --> 4760.56]  People, I keep seeing things, people always ask me the same questions.
[4760.84 --> 4763.28]  One of them is, do you have Dutch roots?
[4763.80 --> 4764.74]  And I always say, yes.
[4765.06 --> 4766.42]  My dad is from there.
[4766.74 --> 4768.28]  And then they say, do you speak Dutch?
[4768.30 --> 4769.36]  And I say, no, I don't.
[4769.76 --> 4771.12]  And then they say, what's on your tattoo?
[4771.70 --> 4772.80]  And it says, je m'en t'en d'oeur.
[4772.80 --> 4775.62]  And then it's like a Dutch thing, but it's in French.
[4775.84 --> 4777.88]  So it's really confusing to explain.
[4777.88 --> 4779.50]  So I try not to explain it.
[4779.56 --> 4780.94]  But then I covered it all.
[4781.08 --> 4782.42]  And then something else, but I can't remember.
[4782.70 --> 4783.16]  There you go.
[4784.02 --> 4784.78]  What about Taron?
[4785.28 --> 4786.26]  Taron's too busy, man.
[4786.26 --> 4786.88]  He's busy.
[4787.04 --> 4787.96]  He really is busy.
[4788.14 --> 4789.64]  He told me he was too busy.
[4789.76 --> 4790.90]  I would love to have Taron on here.
[4790.94 --> 4791.94]  I'd love to have Ed on here.
[4792.06 --> 4795.30]  But Ed is editing a super important thing that has to go up.
[4795.76 --> 4798.02]  And I don't really want to bug him because I think he's too busy.
[4798.14 --> 4799.04]  Is that right, Linus?
[4799.18 --> 4800.10]  Yeah, they're both pretty busy.
[4800.10 --> 4800.82]  So I can't really bug him.
[4801.00 --> 4802.46]  And then Taron's really busy too, right?
[4802.56 --> 4802.84]  Yeah.
[4803.60 --> 4804.06]  Yeah, OK.
[4804.16 --> 4805.68]  So they're both too busy, unfortunately.
[4805.68 --> 4808.22]  I wanted to have everyone on, but Colton wasn't here.
[4808.32 --> 4809.30]  And those two guys are too busy.
[4809.56 --> 4810.26]  See, hey, Nick.
[4810.34 --> 4810.80]  I am Dutch.
[4810.96 --> 4812.58]  Ik spreek de Nederland.
[4815.14 --> 4815.50]  Always.
[4815.68 --> 4816.12]  I don't know.
[4816.24 --> 4817.14]  I can't tell.
[4817.22 --> 4817.90]  I can only guess.
[4817.98 --> 4819.34]  I think he said, I speak Dutch.
[4819.48 --> 4820.42]  Yeah, but one of them.
[4820.70 --> 4821.24]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4821.24 --> 4821.74]  But one of them.
[4821.84 --> 4823.28]  I think it said, super fun.
[4823.66 --> 4825.50]  So maybe he said, I watch super fun.
[4825.64 --> 4826.08]  There you go.
[4827.52 --> 4827.84]  Cool.
[4828.22 --> 4828.50]  Cool.
[4828.98 --> 4829.20]  Yeah.
[4829.28 --> 4829.46]  Cool.
[4829.52 --> 4829.98]  That was fun.
[4830.02 --> 4830.14]  You good then?
[4830.28 --> 4832.26]  Yeah, I think I'm going to get out of here and go die.
[4832.36 --> 4833.66]  Because I'm probably going to leave too.
[4833.88 --> 4834.48]  You feel sick?
[4834.54 --> 4836.46]  Yeah, that sushi made me feel so sick.
[4836.50 --> 4837.16]  I ate too much.
[4837.26 --> 4840.74]  And then I was like, when I was, when I thought I was going up after John.
[4840.94 --> 4843.78]  And I was like, OK, I don't feel too well.
[4844.64 --> 4845.82]  I'm like, I should bring this cup.
[4846.02 --> 4848.26]  Because it has a little bit of coffee in it.
[4848.28 --> 4850.96]  But if I do have to throw up in a pinch, right in the cup.
[4851.02 --> 4852.04]  That's all extra large.
[4852.14 --> 4852.56]  That's fair.
[4852.66 --> 4853.54]  It's like a liter of coffee.
[4853.54 --> 4854.54]  That's a fair amount of puke.
[4854.62 --> 4855.24]  A liter coffee.
[4855.24 --> 4857.14]  If that overflows, though, it's going to be nice.
[4857.38 --> 4857.72]  Ooh.
[4858.24 --> 4859.40]  One can only hope.
[4860.46 --> 4861.22]  Bye, everyone.
[4861.62 --> 4862.36]  Nice to talk to you.
[4862.50 --> 4863.28]  Have a happy holiday.
[4863.56 --> 4864.12]  Merry Christmas.
[4864.42 --> 4864.86]  Kwanzaa.
[4864.90 --> 4865.30]  Hanukkah.
[4865.40 --> 4866.02]  All that stuff.
[4866.52 --> 4867.60]  Thank you guys for watching.
[4867.82 --> 4872.24]  Hopefully you guys liked the 2015 recap WAN show.
[4872.58 --> 4874.72]  Next week will be another weird WAN show.
[4875.72 --> 4878.72]  I think it might not be.
[4878.72 --> 4880.44]  I'm pretty sure it's not on the Friday again.
[4881.08 --> 4882.22]  Although I don't remember.
[4882.22 --> 4884.74]  It might be filmed on Thursday.
[4884.86 --> 4885.72]  Uploaded on Friday.
[4886.50 --> 4890.28]  And that one will be partially news.
[4890.56 --> 4891.60]  So more regular.
[4891.80 --> 4892.86]  Like a normal WAN show.
[4893.12 --> 4897.40]  And then it will be Linus and I discussing what we expect to see at CES for part of it.
[4898.60 --> 4900.66]  So, yeah.
[4900.78 --> 4902.28]  There will not be an after party.
[4902.80 --> 4906.20]  And I do not think I will be streaming after this.
[4906.98 --> 4907.46]  Unfortunately.
[4908.74 --> 4909.90]  Sorry about that.
[4909.90 --> 4912.28]  I have a family function to go to.
[4912.68 --> 4915.08]  I am going to try to stream sometime this weekend.
[4915.56 --> 4918.00]  Because I don't want to completely screw up my streaming schedule.
[4918.40 --> 4919.88]  I will not be able to stream on Friday.
[4920.14 --> 4920.46]  Guys.
[4920.56 --> 4921.08]  That's Christmas.
[4921.32 --> 4921.68]  I'm sorry.
[4922.26 --> 4925.40]  If I do stream on Friday, it will be at like 1 or 2 in the morning.
[4925.76 --> 4927.12]  And I seriously doubt it.
[4927.42 --> 4928.74]  So, don't count on that.
[4928.74 --> 4929.18]  Yeah.
[4931.58 --> 4931.98]  Yeah.
[4932.94 --> 4933.80]  Thanks for watching.
[4934.42 --> 4935.40]  Kind of a weird WAN show.
[4936.02 --> 4937.28]  Sponsor spots were super late.
[4938.00 --> 4938.80]  I wish we got everyone.
[4938.88 --> 4939.76]  We didn't quite get everyone.
[4942.02 --> 4942.42]  Yeah.
[4942.86 --> 4943.38]  Merry Christmas.
[4943.52 --> 4944.10]  Happy holidays.
[4944.24 --> 4945.94]  Happy whatever the heck you like celebrating.
[4946.60 --> 4947.50]  We'll see you guys later.
[4951.68 --> 4952.54]  That didn't work.
[4953.64 --> 4954.88]  So, I'll see you guys now.
[4954.88 --> 4962.78]  I can't close the program.
[4962.78 --> 4964.86]  I'm going to end.
