[0.00 → 4.40] Dream is live! Welcome to the WAN show my friends.
[4.40 → 8.86] You know, I sent out a tweet because a bunch of people apparently thought that this WAN show wasn't going to be a thing.
[9.28 → 16.56] So I sent out a tweet being like, it's actually a thing, we'll be live in, checked the time, it was 3.30, and I was like, about an hour.
[16.78 → 18.94] I could have said exactly one hour.
[19.14 → 19.68] You could have.
[19.70 → 20.56] And I was like, no!
[21.28 → 23.38] That would have been a crazy thing for you to do.
[23.86 → 24.68] Yeah, yeah.
[25.12 → 28.10] You're a crazy kind of guy, we know all about this.
[28.10 → 30.10] Sorry, what are we talking about? Right, it's time for the show.
[30.34 → 33.54] So let's kick things off with some fun.
[34.08 → 36.98] Oh, right, no, we'll kick things off with what we're going to talk about today.
[37.10 → 37.38] Yes.
[37.56 → 38.24] Right, thank you.
[38.64 → 41.90] So I wanted to talk about your haircut. I think you look very nice.
[42.38 → 43.70] Didn't you also get a haircut?
[43.70 → 44.94] I did, I'm fishing for compliments.
[45.26 → 47.16] Ah, I see, I think yours is wonderful.
[47.34 → 47.70] Thank you.
[48.24 → 49.38] Mine cost $0.
[50.34 → 51.02] Oh, that's nice.
[51.12 → 51.30] Yeah.
[51.40 → 51.86] Mine didn't.
[51.92 → 52.58] My wife did it.
[52.70 → 57.06] If I want a $0 haircut, my dad will grab the shaver, put it on the minimum setting and just go...
[57.06 → 59.22] Does he have to put it on the minimum setting?
[60.14 → 61.22] Well, it's an option.
[62.34 → 64.62] I mean, it doesn't take that much longer.
[64.76 → 65.84] We have dog clippers.
[66.36 → 67.34] That's what we have.
[68.98 → 70.88] Probably excellent quality clippers.
[70.90 → 71.50] Oh, they're great.
[71.58 → 71.84] Yeah.
[71.84 → 73.24] And like, well taken care of.
[73.34 → 73.48] Right.
[73.48 → 74.18] And all that kind of stuff.
[74.50 → 75.38] Yeah, yeah.
[76.08 → 77.88] And also used for my hair sometimes.
[77.90 → 79.02] And also used for your hair sometimes.
[79.12 → 81.44] I mean, dog hair is perfectly safe.
[82.28 → 84.50] People are talking about Dollar Shave Club.
[84.62 → 85.14] No, no, no, no.
[85.18 → 86.62] Dollar Shave Club is for the face.
[87.88 → 89.20] No, if you were bald.
[89.74 → 90.50] Yes, okay.
[90.58 → 93.14] You could use both their shaving cream and their shavers if you were bald.
[93.14 → 93.80] Funny story.
[93.96 → 95.96] Dollar Shave Club is not one of our sponsors today.
[96.12 → 96.20] No.
[96.20 → 97.32] But this is just an anecdote.
[98.54 → 102.44] When I was researching Dollar Shave Club to find out whether we should take them on as
[102.44 → 108.30] a sponsor, there was actually one review on YouTube in particular of a dude who didn't
[108.30 → 112.30] get provided Dollar Shave Club razors, but just signed up for it and did a review that
[112.30 → 113.58] had like 70,000 views.
[113.98 → 115.36] And he was, he was bald.
[115.72 → 121.18] And so I think people who shave their heads as well with their razors are going to be
[121.18 → 124.68] way better people to talk to about the longevity of the blade.
[124.68 → 127.20] So he's like, yeah, it lasts longer than...
[127.20 → 130.12] Quality too though, because you have such a bigger zone where you can potentially cut
[130.12 → 130.50] yourself.
[130.62 → 130.78] Yep.
[130.90 → 132.96] And shaving your face is actually relatively easy.
[133.06 → 133.96] Because you can see what you're doing.
[134.10 → 134.32] Yeah.
[134.54 → 135.12] So he was...
[135.12 → 136.86] The back of your head and stuff is not going to be easy.
[136.86 → 138.16] He was just like, yeah, these are good.
[138.34 → 138.98] And I'm like, okay.
[138.98 → 140.12] And I guess they're a sponsor.
[142.04 → 143.78] So where was I?
[143.90 → 144.10] Right.
[144.48 → 145.98] Sony pirated movie...
[145.98 → 146.98] No, they didn't pirate...
[146.98 → 150.32] Sony pirated the interview.
[150.70 → 150.94] No.
[151.16 → 151.62] Hold on.
[151.74 → 152.14] Back up.
[152.30 → 154.78] Sony pirated music in the interview.
[154.92 → 156.80] That is to say they used it without permission.
[157.00 → 157.74] More on that later.
[158.40 → 161.98] Hollywood says...
[161.98 → 164.86] Well, Hollywood is a place, but they can't really say anything.
[164.98 → 165.50] But in general.
[166.40 → 167.88] Content producers from Hollywood.
[167.88 → 171.16] Google Fibre leads to more pirating.
[172.92 → 174.02] We'll get into that later.
[174.46 → 175.48] What else are we going to get into later?
[175.48 → 179.88] Google steps up and says that if the internet has made a Title II service, that they will
[179.88 → 183.72] jump on board and distribute fibre as much as they can because they love pull access.
[183.98 → 184.28] Awesome.
[184.52 → 185.18] More on that later.
[185.66 → 191.24] And Kim.com is to release a chat client for your web browser, which is totally encrypted.
[191.50 → 195.56] And he's taken shots at basically everybody, but mainly Skype from Microsoft saying that
[195.56 → 197.42] they are just terrible ways to communicate with people.
[197.88 → 201.40] Speaking of terrible ways to communicate with people, the intro.
[201.40 → 219.82] I love this music.
[219.82 → 223.60] And our sponsors today.
[224.92 → 225.90] Oh, there it is.
[225.90 → 227.16] Linda.com.
[227.24 → 229.16] The place to learn online.
[229.64 → 233.64] Or learn in person, but with a computer that is connected online.
[233.90 → 234.18] Yes.
[234.42 → 234.76] Yes.
[235.14 → 235.42] Yes.
[235.42 → 236.56] And Squarespace.
[237.04 → 239.24] The place to make your website online.
[239.60 → 243.98] Well, you can make the website in person, but you would be interacting with Squarespace's
[243.98 → 245.88] website builder through a web browser.
[246.74 → 248.48] We specify everything.
[248.90 → 250.12] And Phantom Glass.
[250.68 → 253.44] The way to protect your phone online.
[253.80 → 255.20] Or all the time.
[255.88 → 257.06] Protect your phone.
[257.20 → 257.90] Phantom Glass.
[258.10 → 259.32] Put the protector on in person.
[259.60 → 260.30] Screen protector.
[260.30 → 260.64] Yeah.
[260.72 → 262.20] Then look through the glass.
[262.38 → 263.18] And online.
[263.74 → 268.38] Also, Phantom Glass is our main sponsor for CES 2015.
[270.32 → 270.88] CES.
[270.96 → 271.40] CES.
[271.50 → 271.94] CES.
[272.22 → 272.62] Sunday.
[272.82 → 273.08] Monday.
[273.28 → 273.58] Tuesday.
[273.82 → 274.16] Wednesday.
[274.50 → 274.86] Thursday.
[275.08 → 275.30] Friday.
[275.30 → 275.50] Friday.
[275.50 → 276.50] Friday.
[276.50 → 277.50] Friday.
[277.50 → 278.50] Friday.
[278.50 → 278.62] Friday.
[278.62 → 280.18] Don't miss any of our coverage.
[280.54 → 286.36] And head over to store.fantomglass.glass if you want to check out their fantastic glass
[286.36 → 287.66] screen protectors.
[287.82 → 291.62] So we are going to be having some fun with our Phantom Glass protected phones while we're
[291.62 → 292.30] down at the show.
[292.42 → 295.12] So stay tuned for that, you guys.
[296.86 → 300.08] So apparently people are asking if the stream is going.
[300.38 → 300.84] Yes.
[300.96 → 302.34] The stream is going.
[302.98 → 303.46] Friday.
[303.70 → 304.04] Friday.
[304.28 → 304.64] Friday.
[304.64 → 304.82] Friday.
[305.50 → 307.46] Okay.
[308.80 → 312.32] We should just release a shirt that just says Friday, Friday, Friday on it.
[312.42 → 314.76] We should totally do a Friday, Friday shirt.
[315.58 → 316.88] It should be like spelled wrong.
[317.60 → 318.66] F-R-Y.
[319.26 → 320.64] Friday, Friday, Friday.
[320.78 → 322.10] 4.36 p.m.
[323.60 → 325.16] In 22 seconds.
[325.58 → 326.04] Sometimes.
[326.28 → 326.48] Yeah.
[327.52 → 328.04] Sometimes.
[328.66 → 330.14] Super random number.
[330.56 → 331.16] All right.
[331.16 → 335.98] So this was posted by victorious secret on the forum.
[335.98 → 338.74] I'm going to go ahead and copy the link here.
[338.98 → 340.66] Fire this over to you guys.
[341.16 → 344.04] Original article here is from Torrent free.
[344.04 → 344.98] Oh, it's okay.
[344.98 → 345.86] I got this.
[345.86 → 346.44] I got this.
[346.44 → 346.86] All right.
[347.26 → 349.32] So actually, yes.
[349.40 → 351.00] No, let's switch over to you doing that.
[351.12 → 352.08] So here you go, guys.
[352.60 → 358.54] Sony about to get sued for pirating music in the interview.
[358.74 → 361.34] The famous movie or infamous movie.
[361.50 → 361.66] Yeah.
[361.66 → 365.82] Whatever this movie is that I still haven't seen, probably won't see.
[365.94 → 366.90] I haven't seen it either.
[366.96 → 368.82] I commend Sony for releasing it.
[369.34 → 375.82] Except that they should have probably sorted out their licensing deal with, what's her name?
[375.98 → 379.36] Soon Mi Rae, also known as Natasha Shanta Reid.
[379.36 → 383.96] A US born hip hop and R&B singer whose song they used.
[384.08 → 387.40] It's called Payday without her permission.
[387.80 → 393.54] They were negotiating to use the song and then the negotiations fell apart and then.
[394.76 → 395.96] Then they just used it.
[396.50 → 399.82] It was assumed that Sony had moved on and picked a different song.
[400.22 → 401.80] That was not the case.
[402.28 → 404.56] They just decided to use the same one.
[405.38 → 409.10] Should we jump right into Hollywood talking about piracy because that just makes sense?
[409.10 → 409.76] Yeah, yeah.
[410.02 → 413.26] So her agency, Feel Good Music.
[413.72 → 414.52] I can't really.
[414.52 → 415.16] Best name.
[415.98 → 416.92] Best name.
[417.12 → 417.84] Feel Good Music.
[417.92 → 418.66] It's not even spelled right.
[418.66 → 419.86] It's like Linus Media Group.
[419.92 → 421.40] G-H-O-O-D.
[421.84 → 423.12] Feel good.
[423.40 → 423.88] Good.
[424.10 → 424.74] Feel good.
[425.12 → 430.12] Well, maybe the person that started this company, maybe their last name was Good.
[432.96 → 434.90] It's like naming your company Linus Media Group.
[435.28 → 436.42] It's not quite the same.
[436.50 → 437.28] You just put your name in it.
[437.28 → 437.76] Okay.
[437.76 → 439.10] It's like, um...
[439.10 → 441.46] But your first name because you're just that kind of person.
[442.46 → 442.86] Okay.
[444.08 → 445.14] Nothing of crap.
[445.78 → 449.72] At least I don't have to carry around business cards that have someone else's name on them.
[449.80 → 450.08] That's true.
[450.08 → 453.52] The most awkward part is when someone will be like, what's your boss's email?
[453.66 → 456.68] I'm like, um, Linus at blah.
[456.94 → 457.70] Like, okay.
[457.84 → 459.00] That's, that's...
[459.00 → 460.10] Oh, no.
[460.10 → 465.58] So, Natasha's agency has said that they will be taking legal action against Sony Pictures.
[465.58 → 470.04] The damages that they're seeking, I don't have them in my notes here, but I found some
[470.04 → 474.50] rumoured damages that they're seeking, and they're just, like, just pants on head ridiculous.
[474.80 → 477.12] Like, nothing to do with reality.
[477.12 → 481.26] Well, I'm wondering if part of the damages part is that they didn't want to be associated
[481.26 → 481.86] with the movie.
[482.22 → 483.54] Ooh, then they could be big.
[483.68 → 483.96] Yes.
[484.14 → 488.08] I think that's going to be a huge part of this whole negotiation is that they, they could
[488.08 → 491.74] claim that they didn't want to be a part of the movie because of all the ramifications
[491.74 → 492.60] that tied to it.
[492.82 → 496.44] And even though these negotiations were probably going on before all of that.
[496.48 → 497.86] Yeah, definitely before all that.
[497.86 → 500.10] They could still be able to claim all of it at the same time.
[500.32 → 501.14] What a disaster.
[501.56 → 505.24] Because it would be super easy for them to be like, well, we saw this coming.
[505.98 → 507.02] Didn't want to be a part of it.
[507.68 → 510.10] So, more news from Torrent Freak.
[510.22 → 510.96] I've got it.
[511.00 → 511.54] I've got the post.
[511.84 → 513.48] Oh, you were already ready with it, weren't you?
[513.76 → 514.16] Uh, yeah.
[514.28 → 514.78] Well, whatever.
[514.86 → 515.24] It's there.
[515.66 → 517.76] Um, so more news from Torrent Freak.
[518.98 → 519.38] Hollywood.
[520.70 → 523.60] Google Fibre increases piracy.
[524.82 → 526.62] They're pirating or whatever.
[526.62 → 529.34] It's posted by Ah Ming on the forum.
[529.60 → 530.86] Leads to more piracy.
[531.26 → 532.90] Let's go ahead and fire this up.
[533.22 → 536.64] Movie studios fear a Google Fibre piracy surge.
[536.76 → 540.80] Now, so here, do you want to go through the points on this, and then we'll discuss it?
[540.80 → 547.68] They polled about 2,000 people ages between 13 and 54 about their piracy habits and media
[547.68 → 548.40] and whatnot.
[548.86 → 554.32] More than half were interested in Google Fibre, including a large group of the pirates within
[554.32 → 554.82] that group.
[554.82 → 555.22] Yep.
[555.32 → 558.66] So, apparently 2,000 people is a good enough number of people to poll.
[559.66 → 559.90] Um...
[559.90 → 561.00] I'm not even...
[561.00 → 561.20] Okay.
[561.34 → 563.48] We can attack them about lots of stuff here.
[563.54 → 565.24] Let's not attack them about their sample size.
[565.32 → 567.06] I mean, 2,000 people is...
[567.06 → 568.68] It's a sample size.
[568.76 → 569.38] It's not huge.
[569.62 → 570.72] It's not huge.
[570.80 → 574.34] And the problem is with that number, it gets to...
[574.34 → 575.78] Like, it's only Kansas City.
[576.58 → 576.88] Mm-hmm.
[577.12 → 577.46] Right.
[577.52 → 583.32] But it's Kansas City because they wanted to poll people prior to the Google Fibre rollout,
[583.42 → 587.28] then poll them again after Google Fibre had been rolled out.
[587.32 → 588.16] So, I get it.
[588.22 → 588.66] I get it.
[588.66 → 588.74] Yeah.
[588.86 → 589.48] No, that makes sense.
[589.48 → 589.78] Okay.
[589.86 → 591.38] Like, let's attack them for other things.
[591.44 → 592.86] So, do you want to run through the rest of it first?
[593.08 → 595.80] Uh, I don't think there's a ton else, to be completely honest.
[597.12 → 598.16] Okay, so...
[598.16 → 602.50] The research tries to estimate how much money they're going to lose due to Google Fibre and whatnot.
[602.72 → 608.56] But I think the general idea is more just having faster internet will cause more piracy.
[608.68 → 609.84] That's what they're trying to prove.
[610.84 → 611.36] And...
[611.36 → 611.70] Yeah.
[611.78 → 616.60] So, the study finds a link between piracy and broadband speeds.
[616.84 → 617.56] I think it's...
[617.56 → 617.82] Sorry.
[618.64 → 621.58] I think is probably common sense.
[622.02 → 622.34] Yeah.
[622.46 → 623.80] It's probably completely valid.
[623.80 → 624.80] I mean, the thing is that...
[625.38 → 625.62] Okay.
[626.36 → 628.00] Here's what this comes down to.
[628.00 → 629.80] We've been through this on the show before.
[629.96 → 630.72] We agree that...
[630.72 → 633.58] We agree that not paying for things is bad.
[633.94 → 642.30] But the problem, the issue, is that accessing things by paying them is often less convenient than pirating them.
[642.32 → 643.58] And I think the whole...
[643.58 → 650.68] The whole BS that's been going on between Netflix and the US ISPs, for example, is a great...
[650.68 → 650.80] Yeah.
[650.80 → 653.18] Is a great example of this.
[653.18 → 658.90] Where your Netflix stream is going to be either not working correctly with buffering all the time...
[658.90 → 665.20] Or even just degraded enough that you get blockiness and choppiness in your video playback.
[665.20 → 667.50] So it's not an excellent experience.
[667.50 → 669.80] So you kind of go, okay, well, crap.
[669.88 → 676.26] I guess I'll just download it and watch it at my leisure then, even though this is something that I should be able to stream to myself.
[676.68 → 686.98] So the issue here is that the ISPs, often with very tight ties to broadcast companies like NBC, for example, is owned by...
[686.98 → 687.24] Crap.
[687.36 → 689.34] I'm going to completely fall apart here.
[689.44 → 690.14] It's Comcast, right?
[690.20 → 690.72] I'm not sure.
[690.72 → 692.16] Yeah, Comcast owns NBC.
[692.44 → 694.70] And so there are a lot of relationships like that.
[695.22 → 696.70] So there is...
[696.70 → 703.78] So this basically is how we discover why the ISPs are not upgrading their networks.
[703.78 → 706.80] Because they don't want your internet connection to be good.
[706.96 → 710.00] It's not even a matter of, like, the fibre is expensive.
[710.00 → 713.20] They straight up don't want your internet connection to be good.
[713.30 → 726.44] Because then you'll pirate and or even watch competing services like Netflix instead of watching on your television where they can throw ads at you every, you know, eight minutes in between your programming.
[726.50 → 727.72] Distribution is the problem.
[727.72 → 729.72] When it comes down to the question of...
[730.26 → 735.18] I've even had friends who have been in situations where they'll properly buy something.
[735.60 → 746.44] But then it's broken, or some process is messed up or because of some DRM or some other reason they can't even access their freaking game, or it makes it incredibly hard to play.
[746.84 → 752.04] And it has become easier for them to just download the pirated version and run that one.
[752.10 → 756.26] Even if they've actually paid for it, it's easier to just run the pirated copy.
[756.26 → 763.78] And especially when you get stuff like Google Fibre which will make that downloading process extremely easy, it makes that more likely.
[763.92 → 767.84] Distribution is and basically has always been the problem.
[768.14 → 769.00] So there you go.
[769.12 → 771.82] So Hollywood's afraid that Google Fibre leads to more piracy.
[771.94 → 776.06] But the way that I see it is holding back the infrastructure is not the solution to this.
[776.16 → 781.70] The solution to this is to make the content accessible in the way that people actually want to access it.
[781.96 → 785.82] Why can't I, like, properly get HBO without a cable connection in Canada?
[786.26 → 790.96] Yeah, HBO is slowly coming around on that.
[790.96 → 793.28] There's an HBO Go or whatever, but it's not in Canada.
[793.38 → 794.92] Yeah, I remember reading about this.
[795.04 → 798.40] They're finally turning it around, but it's starting US only.
[798.40 → 807.22] And the thing is, like, Game of Thrones, guys, so pirate, very illegal, much distribute torrent.
[807.46 → 808.50] Like, it's...
[808.50 → 810.56] And, like, I don't remember the guy's name right now.
[811.08 → 812.12] John Oliver, I think.
[812.24 → 813.40] I really like his show.
[813.76 → 816.12] I watch the YouTube highlights all the time.
[817.16 → 820.18] I don't have any way to actually watch it properly.
[820.18 → 823.48] I haven't pirated it or anything, but I've just been living off the YouTube thing.
[823.56 → 827.46] And I would love to sign up for HBO Go just to be able to watch John Oliver's show.
[827.80 → 828.08] Right.
[828.22 → 829.68] But I can't because it's not...
[829.68 → 831.94] Well, can't because it's not in Canada.
[833.32 → 833.96] So, yeah.
[834.10 → 838.82] I guess basically, yes, Hollywood, Google Fibre will lead to more piracy.
[838.82 → 848.88] I mean, there's no doubt that pirates are going to be some of the main guys and gals who are interested in massive fat pipe internet connections.
[849.34 → 849.86] Duh.
[850.10 → 859.38] Also, another thing is people that are interested in big, new, kind of bleeding-edge, powerful services are going to want to do a lot with those things.
[859.56 → 859.70] Yeah.
[859.70 → 869.52] And, like, selling someone, you know, a DVD that has an online license to watch on two devices or whatever.
[869.66 → 873.34] Like, remember that whole goofy thing where they were doing digital copies and DVDs?
[873.42 → 874.28] Maybe they still do.
[874.36 → 875.60] I haven't bought a DVD.
[875.96 → 876.46] I don't know.
[876.70 → 877.00] Netflix.
[877.30 → 878.48] I own one Blu-ray.
[879.00 → 879.96] I don't own any.
[880.80 → 886.44] And actually, I think I only own, like, two DVDs, two video DVDs.
[886.44 → 889.76] One is the first season of an awesome show called Made in Canada.
[890.12 → 890.36] Yeah.
[890.58 → 892.36] And the second is actually here at the office.
[892.58 → 895.30] I own a DVD copy of The Princess Bride, special edition.
[895.42 → 898.36] I have the Ocean Series.
[898.88 → 899.54] Those are kind of good.
[899.82 → 900.60] And I think that's it.
[901.10 → 902.46] And I don't know where they are.
[902.60 → 903.22] I was just thinking.
[903.36 → 906.10] I was thinking, how do I not own any Star Wars DVDs?
[906.10 → 908.06] And it's because my only copies of Star Wars are VHS.
[908.16 → 908.82] VHS, yeah.
[909.32 → 909.52] Yeah.
[909.52 → 911.90] I have the VHS of the original three.
[911.94 → 912.26] All right.
[912.46 → 915.74] More Google and more Google Fibre discussion.
[915.74 → 918.54] So, this is an article from Engadget.com.
[918.62 → 920.08] I'm just going to fire it up here.
[920.50 → 929.28] So, Google tells the FCC, look, if those other guys are going to drag ass and not bother to
[929.28 → 935.04] roll out their fibre upgrades, you know, if you declare internet to be a Title II utility,
[935.28 → 935.70] then fine.
[935.94 → 936.66] We'll expand it.
[937.12 → 937.62] We'll do it.
[937.62 → 942.86] Because the problem is right now, anywhere where Google wants to roll out fibre, they
[942.86 → 947.76] have to dig their own trenches in order to get it to the buildings where they need to
[947.76 → 948.20] get it to.
[948.60 → 954.18] If they had access to the underground conduits and to the telephone poles, then they would
[954.18 → 956.60] be able to roll it out for, what was the article figuring?
[956.72 → 957.20] Something like that.
[957.20 → 957.54] I think.
[957.54 → 959.12] A tenth of the cost.
[959.14 → 959.82] Digging trenches.
[960.02 → 960.66] Crazy expensive.
[961.10 → 966.74] So, Google has already managed to make it somewhat economical at ten times the cost of what they
[966.74 → 970.80] think it would cost them if it turns into a Title II utility, if it gets reclassified,
[971.00 → 973.16] and they can just roll out fibre wherever.
[973.68 → 974.46] Holy crap.
[974.66 → 975.64] That would be awesome.
[975.64 → 985.14] And honestly, if I'm AT&T right now, do I just kind of go, okay, crap, I guess we better
[985.14 → 986.00] just get on this.
[986.28 → 991.32] Okay, I guess the, you know, $60, $70 a month that we're getting from our subscribers is pretty
[991.32 → 991.60] good.
[991.90 → 997.12] Maybe we should try to retain those customers while we still have a freaking chance.
[997.56 → 999.76] So, I don't know if it's the overall cost.
[999.76 → 1005.86] It says the access to poles, ducts, and conduits at a tenth of the cost is limited by federal
[1005.86 → 1006.18] law.
[1006.50 → 1008.20] So, it's probably not the overall cost.
[1008.24 → 1011.92] It's probably those aspects individually, but it's still a huge savings.
[1012.60 → 1013.62] Massive, massive savings.
[1013.74 → 1020.88] And if they're able to go through these pre-done setup things, it's going to not only be cheaper,
[1021.08 → 1022.24] but way faster, too.
[1022.24 → 1022.58] Way faster.
[1022.78 → 1026.00] The amount that they are going to be able to spread out is going to be insane.
[1026.32 → 1026.92] And that's awesome.
[1026.96 → 1028.94] And this isn't just Google.
[1028.94 → 1031.88] This is just the extremely loud voice of Google.
[1032.02 → 1035.76] There's also smaller other companies that would now be able to have access to these poles
[1035.76 → 1040.18] and be able to set up, like, those, like, small fibre companies that you hear about just
[1040.18 → 1042.30] in, like, downtown areas of some cities.
[1042.52 → 1046.70] Yeah, like, downtown Vancouver, there's one called Nous that I would love to have access
[1046.70 → 1046.96] to.
[1047.08 → 1051.38] Dirt cheap, wicked fast fibre, but I happen to live in the wrong neighbourhood.
[1051.70 → 1054.70] Yeah, and, like, they'll only go to, like, some office buildings, essentially.
[1054.70 → 1057.94] And that's, like, it because moving it around is so expensive.
[1057.94 → 1061.52] But if you make it much cheaper for them, they're going to be able to spread out those
[1061.52 → 1063.32] little awesome companies like Nous.
[1064.36 → 1064.76] I don't know.
[1065.12 → 1066.50] Pretty awesome, actually.
[1066.70 → 1067.14] Very cool.
[1067.50 → 1067.74] Yeah.
[1067.92 → 1070.70] So this is actually kind of a fun article.
[1070.94 → 1076.54] So Verizon famously said that if the FCC heeds President Obama's urging and declares the
[1076.54 → 1082.52] internet a Title II utility, it would cause great harm to an open internet competition
[1082.52 → 1083.42] and innovation.
[1084.44 → 1085.38] Apparently not.
[1085.46 → 1088.38] But that is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
[1088.66 → 1089.98] Like, so stupid.
[1090.12 → 1090.82] So stupid.
[1090.92 → 1098.46] I mean, the economics of providing internet service to customers and getting monthly subscription
[1098.46 → 1100.24] fees is already proven.
[1100.24 → 1101.98] This is already established.
[1101.98 → 1107.36] And it's not like rolling out the previous infrastructure that they did wasn't expensive
[1107.36 → 1113.38] at the time and didn't make sense based on the subscription costs that were present at
[1113.38 → 1113.78] the time.
[1113.90 → 1119.54] Like, this is an established business that works so well that these companies can, you know,
[1119.62 → 1122.42] develop new content programming.
[1122.42 → 1127.62] And they can, you know, name stadiums and co-build them.
[1127.82 → 1130.42] And so obviously it's perfectly functional.
[1131.72 → 1136.32] And so, yeah, if they're not willing to do it, then great.
[1137.00 → 1137.44] Great.
[1137.64 → 1140.62] I would love to start Linus Media Group ISP.
[1140.78 → 1141.46] That would be awesome.
[1141.70 → 1143.90] I'd love for just a bunch of startups to pop up.
[1143.96 → 1144.46] That'd be great.
[1145.30 → 1147.60] Former FCC Chair Reid Hunt.
[1149.74 → 1150.96] I hope I'm saying that right.
[1151.04 → 1151.86] H-U-N-D-T.
[1151.86 → 1157.42] He told the Washington Street Journal that if Title II gives Google poll access, then it
[1157.42 → 1159.30] might really rock the world with broadband.
[1160.94 → 1161.38] Dang.
[1161.54 → 1162.86] I want my world to get rocked.
[1162.88 → 1164.20] I wish this was happening in Canada.
[1164.46 → 1165.96] I really do as well.
[1166.32 → 1168.78] Speaking of which, Ting, come to freaking Canada.
[1168.94 → 1169.50] Yeah, really.
[1170.24 → 1175.06] That's another, that's an example of the kinds of small time ISPs that would actually be able
[1175.06 → 1177.86] to reach a much, much wider customer base.
[1177.86 → 1179.12] Yeah, for sure.
[1179.12 → 1179.58] All right.
[1179.70 → 1182.46] So is that it for the Google show for today?
[1182.60 → 1184.68] I think that's all we need to talk about with Google.
[1184.68 → 1186.94] We might take a little short break here.
[1187.08 → 1190.40] I just want to bring up that the new office campaign has ended.
[1190.76 → 1190.90] Right.
[1191.00 → 1191.38] It's over.
[1191.38 → 1194.06] Thank you very much for your contributions.
[1194.38 → 1195.76] I kind of maybe didn't update the total yet.
[1196.28 → 1196.42] Oh.
[1196.94 → 1198.14] I just realized.
[1198.46 → 1203.50] So we can't even, I just fired it up so I could show people that.
[1203.56 → 1205.88] I think we might, here.
[1207.02 → 1210.72] Did we hit the LTT LAN hoodie goal?
[1210.72 → 1211.52] Give me a sec.
[1211.52 → 1212.08] Are you checking?
[1212.24 → 1212.68] PayPal?
[1212.80 → 1213.18] Seriously?
[1213.72 → 1214.78] It worked!
[1215.14 → 1215.50] What?
[1215.98 → 1216.32] Wow.
[1216.46 → 1216.88] Apparently.
[1216.94 → 1218.04] Why do they own that?
[1218.26 → 1220.64] Apparently PayPal owns PayPay.com.
[1220.82 → 1221.94] That's so awesome.
[1224.02 → 1225.72] Because that's not even a title.
[1225.98 → 1231.36] That's just like the L and the Y are like here and like here.
[1231.60 → 1234.82] That's just completely not knowing what PayPal's called.
[1234.84 → 1235.76] That's so awesome.
[1235.98 → 1236.26] Uh-oh.
[1237.08 → 1237.70] You're terrible.
[1238.52 → 1239.50] It worked though.
[1239.56 → 1240.24] That's so cool.
[1240.30 → 1241.56] You're basically a bad guy.
[1242.16 → 1242.44] Okay.
[1242.50 → 1244.12] So we need to add a number to this.
[1244.58 → 1244.68] All right.
[1244.68 → 1246.22] Which is going to make this more complicated.
[1246.46 → 1247.04] We have to?
[1247.16 → 1248.04] We have to do what now?
[1248.04 → 1249.18] We have to add a number.
[1249.82 → 1250.16] What?
[1250.32 → 1250.72] What?
[1250.72 → 1250.94] Uh-oh.
[1251.14 → 1252.04] 2400.
[1253.10 → 1253.50] Uh.
[1254.02 → 1254.62] Don't worry.
[1254.74 → 1256.48] We figured it out after a while.
[1257.42 → 1258.24] Well, whatever.
[1258.36 → 1262.80] I just want to take a moment to thank everyone who was involved in the new office campaign.
[1262.80 → 1263.52] Um.
[1263.52 → 1267.80] You know, we had a lot of people criticize us over reaching out to the community to help
[1267.80 → 1268.88] us fund the new office.
[1269.32 → 1269.66] Um.
[1269.66 → 1272.70] And to those people, all I really have to say is, then don't contribute.
[1273.18 → 1273.42] Um.
[1273.42 → 1279.00] We had a lot of people who really did want to help us get a larger, more comfortable working
[1279.00 → 1282.90] space so we could continue to refine our craft and make great content for you guys.
[1283.34 → 1284.86] And to those, I say thank you.
[1284.92 → 1287.14] To the people who were upset about it, um.
[1287.82 → 1288.12] Sorry.
[1289.78 → 1291.94] The ultimate Canadian response to everything.
[1292.08 → 1292.26] Okay.
[1292.34 → 1296.42] So the final number, we raised $38,125.18.
[1296.78 → 1298.78] I really don't know how we ended up with 18 cents.
[1299.14 → 1299.52] Oh, right.
[1299.52 → 1302.60] Because contributions are in US and the total number here is in Canadian.
[1302.70 → 1303.46] And PayPal fees.
[1303.60 → 1304.38] And PayPal fees.
[1304.42 → 1304.62] Right.
[1304.72 → 1305.08] Exactly.
[1305.08 → 1306.06] A couple of things.
[1306.26 → 1307.04] So, um.
[1307.04 → 1307.44] So, yeah.
[1307.52 → 1308.26] Thank you so much.
[1308.26 → 1313.16] That is going to contribute an enormous chunk of the renovations that we're looking to do
[1313.16 → 1313.92] at our new place.
[1314.00 → 1316.20] Things like building up new sets, um.
[1316.20 → 1317.98] Putting in the office spaces we need.
[1318.10 → 1321.54] Storage racks for Luke to put video cards and stuff in.
[1321.74 → 1322.18] Security.
[1322.64 → 1323.52] Sort of doors.
[1323.82 → 1323.94] Overall.
[1323.94 → 1324.44] Don't worry about that.
[1324.52 → 1325.26] Valuable stuff.
[1325.74 → 1327.06] All that good stuff.
[1327.42 → 1327.86] Fantastic.
[1328.22 → 1328.40] Uh.
[1328.40 → 1331.74] So, thank you guys so much for helping us with that.
[1332.10 → 1332.46] Yes.
[1332.46 → 1337.72] And another thing that I want to call out is that UO LTT, or the Linus Tech Tips, Star Citizen
[1337.72 → 1343.02] Organization, is going to be having our battle extravaganza thing starting on the 16th of
[1343.02 → 1343.44] January.
[1343.62 → 1345.50] So, there's a forum topic dedicated to that.
[1345.94 → 1349.60] LTT 2015 starts as in battle starts, uh, 16th of January.
[1349.82 → 1351.80] There's going to be a meeting of how we want to rank people.
[1351.94 → 1352.82] And there's going to be, like, winners.
[1353.12 → 1355.76] And we're going to do some swarm battles and stuff.
[1355.76 → 1357.76] Can I have the rank of Supreme Overlord?
[1359.16 → 1359.92] Show up.
[1360.12 → 1360.90] And then maybe.
[1361.28 → 1362.10] So, we'll see.
[1362.20 → 1364.58] I'm going to be fighting, and I'm going to be joining in.
[1364.70 → 1366.96] So, hopefully everyone kind of rejoins.
[1367.02 → 1369.22] I know the start has been kind of slow.
[1369.40 → 1370.68] It's because there's nothing for us to do.
[1370.86 → 1371.00] Yeah.
[1371.34 → 1372.18] I've got to fix my joystick.
[1372.94 → 1374.16] I've got to buy a joystick.
[1375.08 → 1377.48] I want to get, like, a pretty nice thing.
[1378.30 → 1380.12] And I'm thinking I might just...
[1380.12 → 1380.40] Okay.
[1380.68 → 1381.44] I probably...
[1381.44 → 1381.72] Yeah.
[1381.90 → 1382.30] Probably.
[1382.72 → 1383.04] Okay.
[1383.12 → 1383.98] I might just...
[1383.98 → 1386.04] I might just steal some things from the office.
[1386.04 → 1389.00] Because I kind of want a separate, like, battle station for it.
[1389.00 → 1389.52] What do you need?
[1389.68 → 1389.94] Oh, my word.
[1389.94 → 1391.58] I want a curved monitor.
[1392.14 → 1394.82] Because I'm not using a curved monitor on my gaming rig right now.
[1394.94 → 1395.66] And it's not like...
[1395.66 → 1398.80] It's not like Star Citizen is going to run at 144 FPS anyway.
[1398.80 → 1402.80] So, curved monitor and then, like, a sweet, like, joystick...
[1403.38 → 1403.68] Joy...
[1403.68 → 1404.14] Joystick.
[1404.14 → 1404.62] Joystick.
[1404.62 → 1404.82] Joystick.
[1405.20 → 1405.60] Joystick.
[1406.34 → 1406.74] Joystick.
[1407.46 → 1408.94] I know what they're called.
[1409.34 → 1413.06] No, I'm just laughing because, like, there are the connotations of joystick.
[1413.30 → 1415.32] But then joystick is just even better.
[1415.50 → 1417.10] What would a joystick be?
[1418.26 → 1419.34] An Oreo, perhaps?
[1421.76 → 1422.24] Sorry.
[1422.24 → 1424.58] All right.
[1424.66 → 1425.12] Moving on.
[1425.14 → 1425.24] I'm sorry.
[1425.40 → 1425.92] Can't do this.
[1425.92 → 1431.80] Now, our source for this next article isn't necessarily the most reputable.
[1432.56 → 1435.04] But Fudzilla.com says,
[1435.20 → 1438.04] Intel could save Apple's bacon.
[1438.40 → 1446.42] And, actually, the implications of this news that hasn't really been verified too hard yet,
[1446.52 → 1448.32] but if it's true, is a huge deal.
[1448.38 → 1450.66] The implications of this are enormous.
[1450.88 → 1455.10] Not just for Intel and Apple, but potentially for the entire industry.
[1455.10 → 1455.98] Did you post this already?
[1456.14 → 1456.36] I did.
[1456.64 → 1456.92] Okay.
[1457.32 → 1459.30] So, basically, Fudzilla.com...
[1459.30 → 1461.26] Also, someone just purchased Joystick.com.
[1462.58 → 1463.04] Oh, no.
[1463.04 → 1463.80] Or I said they did.
[1463.88 → 1464.16] I don't know.
[1464.32 → 1465.06] That's awful.
[1466.60 → 1467.16] Sorry.
[1467.16 → 1467.60] Okay.
[1467.60 → 1476.50] So, basically, the rumour is that Samsung and TSMC are both failing to produce 16 nanometre
[1476.50 → 1478.28] FinFET chips for Apple.
[1478.44 → 1479.06] I posted the wrong one.
[1479.06 → 1484.12] It's not that they don't have the fabs kind of up and running.
[1484.20 → 1488.88] The problem right now is that they're not getting strong enough yields on their 16 nanometre
[1488.88 → 1493.34] products in order to meet the demand or to make the cost make sense.
[1493.40 → 1495.08] Because that's the way this whole thing works.
[1495.36 → 1500.88] There's no such thing as a wafer with 100% of the chips on it being usable.
[1501.14 → 1502.10] That's not how it works.
[1502.10 → 1503.42] You produce the wafer.
[1503.60 → 1504.38] You get all the chips.
[1504.52 → 1505.28] You cut them up.
[1505.38 → 1506.16] You test them.
[1506.52 → 1508.60] And then the ones that work, work.
[1508.80 → 1510.64] The ones that don't work, don't work.
[1510.68 → 1515.20] And the ones that kind of work, well, those are going to be your Pentium dual cores and
[1515.20 → 1516.34] your Core i's.
[1516.38 → 1519.64] Whereas the fully functional chips are going to be your Core i's and Core i's.
[1520.14 → 1521.74] So, that's the way all this works.
[1521.78 → 1524.30] And there are lots of different ways for a chip to not work.
[1524.30 → 1529.18] Sometimes it could be fully functional, but maybe it's operating well outside the power
[1529.18 → 1532.22] requirements of the product that you're trying to build with it.
[1532.66 → 1536.18] So, this could be pretty disaster.
[1536.28 → 1537.46] Okay, so basically Apple.
[1537.96 → 1542.56] The word on the street is that they're looking to move to 16 nanometers with their new processors.
[1542.74 → 1549.20] So, they wanted to be on a cutting edge manufacturing process in order to be competitive in terms
[1549.20 → 1554.62] of power consumption, performance, and, well, really, power consumption and performance are
[1554.62 → 1559.18] going to be the big ones with the best that anyone in the world can produce.
[1559.28 → 1562.42] So, right now, Intel is ahead of everyone else.
[1562.50 → 1564.88] I believe they're on 14 nanometers at the moment.
[1565.02 → 1565.12] Yeah.
[1565.46 → 1569.88] So, Intel's on 14 nanometers right now, and they've already begun construction on their
[1569.88 → 1573.42] 10 nanometre fab that should be going online.
[1574.08 → 1574.52] Crap.
[1574.66 → 1576.68] I want to say sometime in 2017.
[1577.26 → 1577.66] Oh, yeah.
[1578.22 → 1579.02] Is that correct?
[1579.20 → 1582.32] It's, I know it was like about two years from now.
[1582.68 → 1586.56] So, 2017 sounds about right, but like, I wouldn't be surprised if it was late 2017.
[1586.66 → 1592.00] Okay, no, Intel says Intel to ship chips in 2015, and they figure 7 nanometre chips in
[1592.00 → 1592.56] 2017.
[1593.14 → 1594.12] So, there you go.
[1594.14 → 1596.92] Maybe that just blew my mind so much when we first covered it that I forgot.
[1597.08 → 1601.00] Well, because 14 nanometers, 14 nanometers was delayed.
[1601.50 → 1605.30] It was only delayed, I think, 6 or 8 months or something like that on Intel's side, but it
[1605.30 → 1606.14] was delayed.
[1606.14 → 1611.28] And then I think the plan on Intel's side was not to slow down development of 10 nanometers.
[1611.66 → 1614.08] So, 14 nanometers would just have a slower life cycle.
[1614.20 → 1617.20] Now, Intel had trouble with 14 nanometres.
[1617.32 → 1619.46] So, it shouldn't be surprising us too much.
[1619.46 → 1625.64] And the end, Intel had a big advantage there too because they were already doing FinFET on
[1625.64 → 1627.54] the previous manufacturing node.
[1628.02 → 1636.24] So, Samsung and TSMC, to my knowledge, are trying to go FinFET and 16 nanometers at the
[1636.24 → 1637.08] same time.
[1637.08 → 1639.94] So, it is no surprise that they're having problems with them.
[1640.28 → 1645.08] And basically, the word on the street, like I said, is that the Apple simply will not be
[1645.08 → 1647.78] able to get chips from them for their upcoming product.
[1647.98 → 1653.38] So, Apple is allegedly in talks with Intel to have Intel start producing chips for Apple.
[1653.38 → 1658.04] This is huge because someone like a Qualcomm.
[1658.40 → 1663.62] So, you know how like every smartphone has a Qualcomm processor in it right now?
[1663.70 → 1665.02] Every high performance smartphone.
[1665.58 → 1668.44] Qualcomm does not own manufacturing.
[1669.02 → 1669.12] No.
[1669.12 → 1676.94] So, they rely on guys like Global Foundries, Samsung, and TSMC to actually manufacture chips
[1676.94 → 1677.30] for them.
[1677.38 → 1683.06] Now, Qualcomm's design might be very power efficient and very high performance and very
[1683.06 → 1684.90] optimized for mobile applications.
[1684.90 → 1692.86] Whereas, Intel has all that legacy x86 stuff to bring with them that really hurts the efficiency
[1692.86 → 1697.12] of their chips in very, very low energy devices like tablets and phones.
[1697.12 → 1707.60] That's improved a lot in the last couple of generations with optimizations on Intel's sides and will continue to improve as Intel forges ahead with smaller and smaller manufacturing
[1707.60 → 1708.02] processes.
[1708.20 → 1709.20] But now imagine this.
[1709.76 → 1715.60] Because Intel, for a long time, enjoyed being a full process node ahead of the entire rest
[1715.60 → 1716.14] of the industry.
[1716.36 → 1721.54] And it looked like at 14 slash 16 nanometre, they were going to catch up.
[1721.54 → 1726.42] And all of a sudden, Intel wasn't going to be able to be slightly less efficient with x86.
[1726.42 → 1731.66] And just be at a lower process node so they could compete with everyone else who's stuck
[1731.66 → 1733.04] on a last-gen manufacturing process.
[1733.16 → 1740.12] Well, now, it looks like Intel could jump as far as two nodes ahead of everyone.
[1740.46 → 1743.92] Which means, which, I mean, that could be the solution.
[1744.54 → 1748.14] I mean, that's funny because they keep doing this.
[1748.14 → 1752.98] It's just like, we will brute force having the best manufacturing in the world.
[1753.12 → 1756.78] And then if the design isn't quite as efficient, then ball it's to that.
[1756.88 → 1757.36] Who cares?
[1757.80 → 1760.86] So we'll be able to save cost with much smaller dies.
[1761.02 → 1767.50] Or we'll be able to save design, and we'll be able to have something that's not quite as efficient as long as we have the best manufacturing in the world.
[1767.50 → 1777.72] If they end up two nodes ahead, your phone in 2016 or 2017 could have an Intel processor in it because there's just no one else who's even in the game.
[1778.60 → 1786.04] It's interesting how companies like Qualcomm now, okay, I'm going to say this, and please take it with a grain of salt, may not have been that big.
[1786.04 → 1788.44] And then just exploded.
[1788.66 → 1792.68] And then Intel's like, no, mine, go away.
[1793.66 → 1806.76] And, I mean, you've got to imagine that someone like Intel isn't going to be giving their most competitive contract manufacturing rates to someone like Qualcomm if they see an opportunity for themselves to jump in and dominate the mobile market.
[1806.90 → 1812.42] I mean, someone like Apple, I think Intel is going to be, it's going to be advantageous for Intel to work with them.
[1812.42 → 1820.20] But if they lock up a contract like Apple, well, that's a huge chunk of the business that existed for other companies.
[1820.50 → 1822.80] Intel and Apple have displayed that they're both willing to do that before.
[1823.10 → 1823.26] Yeah.
[1823.40 → 1823.66] Oh, yeah.
[1823.70 → 1831.98] I mean, it's not like Apple doesn't use Intel chips as begrudgingly as that seems to be happening in their notebooks and their desktop computers.
[1832.52 → 1834.68] And partnering with them on other technologies and stuff.
[1834.70 → 1834.86] Yeah.
[1834.92 → 1835.66] Things like Thunderbolt.
[1835.80 → 1835.90] Yeah.
[1836.06 → 1837.24] It's not like they haven't worked together.
[1837.36 → 1839.36] This is, if true.
[1839.52 → 1841.14] Yeah, I was just going to say that.
[1841.14 → 1843.60] I was just sitting up to bring that up.
[1844.00 → 1844.86] If true.
[1845.06 → 1848.66] I mean, you look at how quickly Qualcomm took over.
[1849.08 → 1849.52] Yeah.
[1850.04 → 1850.38] It happened.
[1850.38 → 1851.06] That's what I mean, though.
[1851.16 → 1851.98] Pretty much overnight.
[1852.00 → 1854.78] I don't necessarily mean small, but in comparative to what they're at now.
[1854.94 → 1858.32] This is a very, very fast moving new market segment.
[1858.64 → 1861.40] Intel could take over that quickly again.
[1861.40 → 1877.68] Because as a smartphone maker, so your HTCs and your Motorola's and Samsung's, you do not risk having the device that is less powerful and less power efficient for rapier battery life.
[1877.68 → 1878.84] You do not risk that.
[1878.84 → 1896.94] If you can buy this processor that allows you to skimp on battery here and skimp on, or have a brighter display in order to make the best use possible of the power that you have available, you are going to get whatever chip is the best.
[1896.94 → 1898.80] And you're going to validate it like crazy.
[1898.80 → 1904.44] Because you cannot afford to develop a smartphone and have it have a crappy processor in it that nobody wants.
[1904.54 → 1905.38] That's bad.
[1906.42 → 1907.42] So, wow.
[1907.42 → 1911.42] And even like public is starting to get quite...
[1912.04 → 1912.84] Really savvy.
[1913.12 → 1913.42] Yeah.
[1913.74 → 1914.86] Especially about phones.
[1915.12 → 1918.92] Like I'll overhear people talking and like maybe it's not the most accurate stuff ever.
[1919.20 → 1921.14] They'll be like, oh yeah, it comes with the Qualcomm.
[1921.60 → 1921.76] Yeah.
[1921.88 → 1923.20] I'm like, okay, well...
[1923.20 → 1925.46] Or it has a Snapdragon quad-core or whatever.
[1925.58 → 1925.84] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1926.16 → 1927.02] They're starting.
[1927.18 → 1927.64] They're starting.
[1927.94 → 1929.30] It's starting to be a thing.
[1929.30 → 1933.74] If Intel goes, do, do, do, do, Intel inside and like...
[1933.74 → 1934.72] And manages to...
[1934.72 → 1935.58] I mean, okay.
[1935.88 → 1937.36] So here, imagine this.
[1937.52 → 1940.92] Imagine around the same time Microsoft gets Windows Phone cleaned up.
[1941.50 → 1941.68] Oh.
[1942.86 → 1944.44] That would be so interesting.
[1944.90 → 1946.86] I would love for Windows Phone to not suck.
[1946.92 → 1948.64] I would love for Windows Phone to not suck too.
[1948.78 → 1949.58] That would be awesome.
[1949.84 → 1958.68] I took so much flack from Windows Phone diehards for my HTC One M8 Windows Edition review where I basically said it was a phone for no one.
[1958.68 → 1959.78] Was what I said.
[1959.88 → 1961.50] And I think people...
[1961.50 → 1962.76] Some of them were...
[1962.76 → 1964.64] Did understand me and were upset anyway.
[1964.86 → 1966.98] But I think a lot of people didn't really understand me.
[1967.02 → 1969.56] Because I didn't mean that Windows Phone is for no one.
[1969.92 → 1972.02] And I didn't mean that the One M8 is for no one.
[1972.24 → 1974.72] I meant that the combination is for no one.
[1974.96 → 1977.20] Because Windows Phone has a place.
[1977.20 → 1983.70] A basic user like my mom, there is no reason why she couldn't enjoy a Windows Phone as much as any other phone.
[1983.86 → 1986.74] My uncle has had one and really liked it.
[1986.74 → 1989.14] And the One M8 is a great phone.
[1989.68 → 1994.12] But the problem is that the One M8 is a flagship class, $600 plus device.
[1994.50 → 2000.22] And if I'm buying $600 smartphones, then I also expect to be using some web services.
[2000.46 → 2004.82] Have some other, you know, connected smart devices.
[2005.32 → 2007.22] I would expect to want to be able to...
[2008.38 → 2010.42] Actually, I guess that's...
[2010.42 → 2011.24] Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[2011.32 → 2011.94] I would want to have access...
[2011.94 → 2013.74] Other more superuser kind of stuff.
[2013.74 → 2019.56] Yeah, so companion apps for the other stuff that's part of my complete digital lifestyle ecosystem.
[2019.68 → 2025.56] If I'm buying complete, like, high-end smartphones, then I expect that I want to use the capabilities of it.
[2025.78 → 2032.40] Other than that, it's just this super high-performance device that has very limited functionality compared to an iPhone or an Android device.
[2032.52 → 2034.38] That's all I really meant by that.
[2034.54 → 2034.84] Yep.
[2034.84 → 2038.56] And I totally stand by it because, well, I don't care about apps.
[2038.64 → 2040.46] Well, then why do you need a high-end phone?
[2041.14 → 2041.60] If you're not...
[2041.60 → 2045.92] If you're running your address book, then who cares?
[2046.24 → 2046.42] Yeah.
[2046.86 → 2050.78] There's way better options on the Windows phone and on the Android side of things.
[2051.62 → 2057.24] And, like, I know it's not really ready yet, but I like the Cortana idea more than most of the...
[2057.24 → 2058.92] I'm really into voice activation stuff.
[2059.00 → 2061.04] I like the Cortana idea much more than the other things.
[2061.04 → 2067.60] Now, Google Now isn't exactly that amazing either, but I think it might work better right now.
[2068.42 → 2069.00] All right.
[2069.08 → 2073.26] So Apple offers a two-week window for iTunes refunds in Europe.
[2073.40 → 2073.82] That's cool.
[2073.92 → 2076.60] So this was posted by Giving TNT on the forum.
[2077.00 → 2079.86] I'm just going to go ahead and pull up the article from KateGuru.net.
[2080.04 → 2088.02] Now, if it's, say, like a movie or a book or something like that, and you open it, they reserve the right to not honour your return,
[2088.02 → 2098.50] which I honestly think is fine because you don't want that situation where, like, someone goes to the store to return their jug of milk with five drops left in the jug of milk being like,
[2098.60 → 2100.32] actually, I didn't like it.
[2100.44 → 2102.62] At Costco, you could probably return that jug of milk.
[2102.76 → 2103.12] Probably.
[2104.02 → 2108.42] But, like, if someone watches an entire movie and then tries to get a full refund, nah.
[2108.42 → 2108.54] Yeah.
[2109.46 → 2113.84] I'm hoping they have some sort of, like, amount of time it was opened tracking or something like that.
[2113.84 → 2115.44] That would be great because it's the same thing at a theatre.
[2115.58 → 2118.90] I think if you sit through the first X amount, they're not going to give you a refund for the ticket.
[2119.08 → 2120.34] But if you leave pretty quickly.
[2120.76 → 2120.92] Yeah.
[2120.92 → 2120.98] Yeah.
[2121.10 → 2123.04] And, like, that's cool, actually.
[2123.10 → 2123.60] I like that.
[2123.60 → 2134.26] But I think it's nice that they have the refund thing, especially for people that might be sharing a phone with their kid might not be the right terminology.
[2134.26 → 2136.86] But, like, letting their kid use, say, like, a tablet or something.
[2137.34 → 2141.36] And they accidentally go to the store, and they're just like, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.
[2142.22 → 2143.78] Hopefully you can return all that junk.
[2144.58 → 2144.70] Yeah.
[2144.70 → 2156.24] I mean, right now, I'm particularly, I'm kind of waiting for Valve to get their crap together and, you know, be the, be the, well, not even the one because EA is already doing it on Origin.
[2156.24 → 2164.94] But raise the bar for digital refunds because there is no reason a digital product shouldn't be refundable in the same way that a physical one.
[2165.04 → 2166.50] More so than a physical one.
[2166.52 → 2168.00] Much more so than a physical one, yeah.
[2168.00 → 2168.20] Yeah.
[2168.56 → 2175.74] And, like, even just have, like, and make it so you can have the overlay on or off and make the default off so it doesn't bother anyone.
[2175.80 → 2176.18] Who cares?
[2176.28 → 2177.48] But, like, have a timer.
[2178.14 → 2181.06] Like, amount of time you're allowed to be in playing a game.
[2182.18 → 2185.12] And, like, maybe you get, like, 15 minutes or something.
[2185.74 → 2187.36] And you get to play the game for 15 minutes.
[2187.80 → 2191.74] And then if you pass the 15-minute threshold, no longer a return.
[2191.86 → 2197.64] And there could be this, like, little, kind of like the Fraps FPS counter just sitting in the top right-hand corner as a timer.
[2198.00 → 2199.70] Or, I don't know.
[2199.88 → 2200.36] Or not.
[2200.50 → 2201.44] But I like that idea.
[2202.22 → 2203.00] I think that would be cool.
[2205.26 → 2207.76] You're taking an extremely long time to create this poll.
[2207.76 → 2221.50] I have a straw poll that actually, it's kind of related to the conversation we're having about if you, like, if you've half watched a movie, then should you have the right to refund it?
[2221.54 → 2223.00] Now, it got me thinking about food.
[2223.00 → 2228.40] If there's a hair in your food, okay, you've got a few options.
[2228.52 → 2235.04] Most places that I'm aware of will offer you a replacement of the same item gratis.
[2235.26 → 2236.60] That's kind of the industry standard.
[2236.84 → 2243.22] If they're sort of, if they're cut above, then they'll bring you the replacement, and they'll wipe the item off of your bill.
[2243.22 → 2246.94] Or, like, sometimes they'll bring you the replacement, and they give you a free dessert or something.
[2246.96 → 2247.14] Yep.
[2247.28 → 2248.22] Or something like that.
[2248.66 → 2251.56] And then the like, yeah, that's, so there.
[2251.72 → 2253.48] Those are pretty much the two options.
[2254.16 → 2256.58] So, there's a hair in your new plate of food.
[2256.82 → 2257.60] Not tech related.
[2258.64 → 2260.60] Do you take out the hair and eat?
[2260.72 → 2261.22] Who cares?
[2261.22 → 2264.74] Do you draw the server's attention to it immediately for a free one?
[2264.86 → 2274.46] Or do you put it aside, eat, like, three quarters or half of the food, put the hair back in, draw their attention to it, and get a full new plate, and get twice the meal?
[2274.58 → 2279.14] What if you have eaten three quarters to half the food, and then you find the hair?
[2279.16 → 2280.38] Well, then that's immediate.
[2280.64 → 2281.10] That's immediate.
[2281.34 → 2281.48] Okay.
[2281.48 → 2288.20] Would you intentionally keep eating to get more food, and then draw the server's attention to the hair?
[2288.20 → 2289.42] So, go ahead.
[2289.50 → 2290.42] I'll let you go first.
[2290.42 → 2298.26] I think I would eat around it until they kind of showed up, and then I'd wave them down.
[2298.54 → 2300.70] So, even if, no matter how much time that was.
[2300.72 → 2302.10] Let's say it was something saucy.
[2302.10 → 2302.58] If I had one spoonful, then they can't sort of right away.
[2302.58 → 2303.70] Like, it's pasta, okay?
[2304.12 → 2307.56] So, like, it got mixed around in there, and probably the hair touched other things.
[2307.66 → 2309.28] But let's say it doesn't look like a pub.
[2310.56 → 2312.06] So, it looks like a head hair.
[2312.98 → 2314.18] I'd probably just wait.
[2314.90 → 2316.16] Unless I'm, like, crazy hungry.
[2316.24 → 2319.04] I've waited before, and I've returned food that had hair in it before.
[2319.20 → 2319.60] Okay.
[2319.60 → 2322.94] I tend to go for the immediate one.
[2323.10 → 2323.32] Yeah.
[2324.56 → 2325.76] Unless I'm starving.
[2326.32 → 2327.42] And then I'll just take it out and eat it.
[2328.08 → 2329.30] I've also been there before.
[2329.42 → 2329.88] Hair is...
[2329.88 → 2332.84] I think it all depends on, like, a bunch of different...
[2332.84 → 2336.44] Like, and I admit that, knowing that that's disgusting.
[2336.62 → 2340.22] Like, hair is the dirtiest thing on your body, other than, like, your butthole.
[2340.46 → 2342.32] Like, hair is super gross.
[2342.44 → 2345.76] And if you have hair in your butthole, then that's even worse.
[2346.00 → 2346.40] Okay?
[2346.40 → 2349.52] So, butthole hair is, like, the worst thing ever.
[2350.16 → 2350.64] Um...
[2350.64 → 2351.26] So you...
[2351.26 → 2354.22] If there's hair in your food, you probably shouldn't eat it.
[2354.40 → 2355.60] But, well, don't...
[2355.60 → 2357.48] Like, I don't just mean not eat the hair.
[2357.64 → 2358.72] Definitely don't eat the hair.
[2358.92 → 2360.46] But you probably shouldn't eat the food.
[2360.66 → 2362.48] Especially if it's something that was mixed, like he said.
[2362.64 → 2362.80] Yeah.
[2362.80 → 2368.44] So, apparently, the vast majority of you draw the server's attention to it, or just take
[2368.44 → 2373.10] the hair out and eat, with only 6% of you saying that you would eat half of it first,
[2373.38 → 2374.94] so that you could just have more food.
[2375.02 → 2376.54] I guess you guys don't have the kind of appetite.
[2376.54 → 2377.70] If it's something that's...
[2377.70 → 2379.72] Especially if it's, like, a multipart meal.
[2380.00 → 2383.02] So, like, if there's some meat and then vegetable and something else.
[2383.68 → 2384.16] Um...
[2384.16 → 2388.24] I will wait until they come around, at least within range, to flag them down.
[2388.50 → 2390.88] Like, if they're back in the kitchen, I'm not going to go up to the kitchen.
[2391.30 → 2391.54] Right.
[2391.54 → 2393.84] But I'll wait until they come out, and then I'll flag them down.
[2393.92 → 2396.48] But I might have a few bites of whatever until they get there.
[2396.56 → 2400.02] Just because I'm like, okay, well, I don't really want to wait longer to be able to eat.
[2400.36 → 2403.40] But I'm also not going to sit here and try and scam you out of a bunch of food.
[2403.54 → 2405.68] Apparently people are thanking me for the cleanliness lesson.
[2405.76 → 2407.88] You probably shouldn't take lessons on cleanliness from me.
[2408.44 → 2412.90] Um, let's go ahead, and speaking of cleanliness, why don't we go ahead and, uh, talk about our
[2412.90 → 2413.94] sponsors for today.
[2414.18 → 2417.82] So our first sponsor is Squarespace.com.
[2417.84 → 2419.32] Where you can make super clean websites.
[2419.48 → 2419.76] Yes!
[2419.76 → 2420.10] Yeah!
[2421.54 → 2422.54] Yes!
[2422.54 → 2422.98] Yes!
[2424.42 → 2432.12] So Squarespace.com recently introduced Squarespace 7, which is their latest massive upgrade over
[2432.12 → 2434.10] their previous Squarespace 6 platform.
[2434.36 → 2436.36] It gives you all kinds of new tools.
[2436.48 → 2438.32] So they've got a redesigned interface.
[2438.74 → 2440.90] They've got integration with Google Apps now.
[2440.90 → 2446.54] So if you use Gmail addresses for your work email and your work docs, and we do, it's awesome
[2446.54 → 2449.04] by the way, then it's got full integration with that.
[2449.12 → 2452.26] Just like before, it's got integration with payment portals.
[2452.26 → 2454.18] So you can create a store on Squarespace.
[2454.18 → 2455.18] It's got new templates.
[2455.18 → 2456.18] It's got cover pages.
[2456.18 → 2458.74] It's got all the same benefits as before.
[2458.74 → 2460.82] So it starts at only $8 a month.
[2460.82 → 2466.24] And if you buy an entire year's worth, then you actually get a free domain thrown in.
[2466.24 → 2468.74] A free, like, regular price domain.
[2468.74 → 2470.42] Not like a $2,000 domain.
[2470.50 → 2471.06] Good try, though.
[2471.06 → 2474.64] So they've got 24-7 tech support online.
[2475.42 → 2476.42] And they've got...
[2476.42 → 2476.70] Oh, yeah.
[2476.90 → 2478.86] So their templates feature responsive design.
[2478.98 → 2482.00] So your site's going to look beautiful if you're looking at it on a computer, if you're
[2482.00 → 2484.76] looking at it on a phone, or whatever else the case may be.
[2485.08 → 2486.48] And they've also got...
[2486.48 → 2487.36] Oh, yes.
[2487.46 → 2487.70] Yeah.
[2487.76 → 2489.50] They've got their new partnership with Getty Images.
[2489.70 → 2495.04] So Squarespace is the most selfish website design company that I've ever encountered because
[2495.04 → 2496.70] they're all about what they want.
[2496.70 → 2499.64] And what they want is the web to look beautiful.
[2499.64 → 2505.16] So they're providing affordable, high-quality images for people because that way, just because
[2505.16 → 2509.40] someone designs a website with a Squarespace template, I mean, they could still put MS
[2509.40 → 2510.66] Paint art all over it.
[2510.78 → 2514.08] And they would still manage to make a Squarespace template look bad.
[2514.22 → 2518.72] Squarespace is like, no, please, stop making our templates look bad, .
[2519.24 → 2524.70] So you can get affordable images on GettyImages.com to make sure that your site looks beautiful.
[2524.70 → 2529.58] I have to chime in here and say that a friend of mine recently...
[2529.58 → 2532.28] Looked into starting a blog thing for themselves.
[2532.40 → 2533.00] They're going to do...
[2533.00 → 2534.04] A blog thing or a blog?
[2534.16 → 2534.44] A blog.
[2534.50 → 2535.28] It's a specific thing.
[2535.78 → 2537.18] What would a blog thing be?
[2537.52 → 2538.24] It's the blog monster.
[2538.24 → 2539.34] Well, like...
[2539.34 → 2546.44] I said specifically blog thing because they're doing a post every day for the next 365 days.
[2546.64 → 2547.78] So they're doing a year worth of this thing.
[2547.78 → 2548.52] That's definitely a blog.
[2548.94 → 2549.18] Thing.
[2549.56 → 2550.84] Just so we're clear, that's a blog.
[2550.84 → 2552.20] Anyway.
[2552.98 → 2553.82] It's for a...
[2553.82 → 2555.14] I'm not going to get into it.
[2555.18 → 2556.94] But anyway, they used WordPress.
[2558.24 → 2558.54] No.
[2558.62 → 2561.10] And I was like, you are using good images.
[2561.58 → 2562.96] And you are using good formatting.
[2563.26 → 2565.06] And you are using good blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2565.26 → 2566.94] But then there's like weird stuff.
[2567.02 → 2568.84] And it doesn't look great because it's on WordPress.
[2568.84 → 2575.54] So I hadn't looked into the specific blog features of Squarespace yet because I was just looking
[2575.54 → 2576.86] into building a website for myself.
[2577.04 → 2577.24] Yeah.
[2577.66 → 2578.76] So I started looking into that.
[2578.86 → 2580.94] And then I'm like, let me make you a website.
[2581.56 → 2582.88] Let me Squarespace you.
[2583.20 → 2584.38] So I don't know.
[2584.48 → 2585.82] I just had to bring that in.
[2586.04 → 2586.26] Yeah.
[2586.30 → 2588.60] Because we've used WordPress in the past.
[2588.60 → 2589.40] And it's just...
[2589.40 → 2590.82] It's so much more manual.
[2591.06 → 2592.96] And you can do a lot of manual stuff with Squarespace.
[2593.14 → 2594.06] But you don't have to.
[2594.34 → 2595.58] Which is a big part of the benefit.
[2595.86 → 2596.12] Yes.
[2596.64 → 2597.04] All right.
[2597.04 → 2599.48] Our other sponsor today is Lynda.com.
[2599.56 → 2605.22] Go to Lynda.com slash WAN show and learn how to do the coding and image manipulation that
[2605.22 → 2609.22] you might need to do in order to build your own very beautiful Squarespace site.
[2609.64 → 2612.80] Actually, that worked in really, really well.
[2613.02 → 2613.84] That was awesome.
[2613.84 → 2619.46] So Lynda.com is where you can get access to great quality video content online from industry
[2619.46 → 2619.92] experts.
[2620.08 → 2625.14] You can learn all kinds of great stuff like programming, like I just said, Photoshop, video
[2625.14 → 2626.58] editing, photography.
[2627.26 → 2630.36] They had some other great examples that I was looking at.
[2630.62 → 2632.30] I always blank on this.
[2632.66 → 2636.04] Like the number of times that I've gone to their site and been like, I'm sure I'm forgetting
[2636.04 → 2636.62] something right.
[2637.00 → 2642.30] 3D animation, business, music, all kinds of crazy stuff that you can learn over at Lynda.com.
[2642.36 → 2646.98] And whether you're a hobbyist or whether you're someone who wants to start a new profession
[2646.98 → 2651.58] or whether you're a professional who just wants to brush up on what's new and what's
[2651.58 → 2651.82] hot.
[2651.90 → 2653.78] They add new content every week.
[2653.94 → 2658.42] So you're always getting the most out of your membership, and you get a free seven day
[2658.42 → 2659.36] to say seven day.
[2659.50 → 2659.78] Dang it.
[2660.00 → 2661.42] You get a free 10-day trial.
[2661.54 → 2663.40] If you go to Lynda.com slash WAN show.
[2663.52 → 2670.48] So you can decide if Lynda.com is right for you before committing and paying the $25 a
[2670.48 → 2672.32] month for one of their plans.
[2672.32 → 2675.66] And then actually we do have one more call out today.
[2675.76 → 2676.96] So we're going to be at CES.
[2677.10 → 2682.98] We're actually flying out Sunday morning and a huge thank you to Phantom Glass, the defender
[2682.98 → 2686.56] of our smartphones for this trip and just in general.
[2686.72 → 2693.22] Phantom Glass is this awesome Gorilla Glass 3 based screen protector that has a whack ton
[2693.22 → 2693.80] of advantages.
[2694.00 → 2696.54] So advantage number one is perfect clarity.
[2696.54 → 2701.20] It is as clear as Gorilla Glass, which is like 99 point whatever.
[2701.92 → 2704.54] Like, yeah, basically it's completely clear.
[2704.98 → 2706.22] Also, the feel.
[2706.44 → 2708.36] Screen protectors feel like butt.
[2708.54 → 2709.24] They're terrible.
[2709.80 → 2711.94] And in addition, so that's great.
[2712.00 → 2713.54] Some screen protectors feel like butt.
[2713.54 → 2714.52] Some feel terrible.
[2714.80 → 2715.08] Not this one.
[2715.52 → 2716.28] Not this one.
[2716.38 → 2720.62] Some screen protectors feel terrible, and they can actually add kind of a fuzziness to the
[2720.62 → 2722.28] image, especially if they're matte ones.
[2722.28 → 2726.60] Well, because it's Gorilla Glass, it's also smudge resistant in much the same way that
[2726.60 → 2727.20] your phone is.
[2727.32 → 2730.68] So you can wipe it off quickly like this, and you're going to be able to get rid of all the
[2730.68 → 2731.56] greasy marks on it.
[2731.80 → 2735.94] Advantage number whatever we're up to is that it goes on with no bubbles guaranteed.
[2736.32 → 2738.16] You can take it off and put it back on.
[2738.22 → 2743.50] I actually got two of them when I did my initial review that prompted us to start the sponsor
[2743.50 → 2744.50] relationship with them.
[2744.76 → 2749.02] And the first one I was like so careful putting it on, and I was like, oh yeah, no bubbles.
[2749.20 → 2751.42] And then the second one I was like, okay, I'm just going to go for this.
[2751.42 → 2754.28] And I just put it on like as badly as I could.
[2754.64 → 2759.64] And like magic in like 30 seconds, all the bubbles just found their way out from between
[2759.64 → 2760.98] the glass and the screen protectors.
[2761.08 → 2761.42] Like what?
[2761.98 → 2766.92] And then the last benefit that we should mention is that they are, that phantom glass is compatible
[2766.92 → 2769.42] with third party cases for your phone.
[2769.58 → 2774.38] That's another problem that you can have with other screen protectors is that they'll, even
[2774.38 → 2779.46] if they fit, they might peel in the edges where they're making contact with your, um, with
[2779.46 → 2783.98] your case, well, that doesn't happen with phantom glass because it's like rounded at the edges
[2783.98 → 2786.02] and very low profile and just basically awesome.
[2786.14 → 2786.84] Phantom glass is good.
[2787.32 → 2790.16] So, um, head over to store.phantom.glass.
[2790.48 → 2791.12] Excuse me.
[2791.18 → 2794.36] Store.phantom.glass to get your own today.
[2794.36 → 2797.08] And don't miss any of our coverage at CES 2015.
[2797.08 → 2800.84] And a huge thank you to the guys at phantom glass and hyper is also sponsoring us there,
[2800.88 → 2804.90] but a huge thank you to the guys at phantom glass who are our presenting sponsor this year.
[2805.00 → 2805.96] You guys are awesome.
[2806.28 → 2808.48] I don't think we got through all of our Google topics.
[2809.02 → 2809.46] No.
[2809.72 → 2809.98] All right.
[2809.98 → 2811.84] Well, let's do something else for now.
[2811.96 → 2812.26] Anyway.
[2812.26 → 2815.36] Um, oh, this is good.
[2815.90 → 2819.68] Uh, Microsoft working on a new browser, not IE.
[2819.88 → 2822.88] So, uh, this was posted on the forum by Alex goes high.
[2823.84 → 2825.86] I don't know what goes high means.
[2826.00 → 2827.14] I understand gets high.
[2827.14 → 2829.44] I've honestly never really got that one.
[2829.70 → 2831.56] So if you, if you, hold on a second.
[2831.56 → 2835.40] So if you, I was wondering if it was like a compression of a word, maybe he's fairly young
[2835.40 → 2837.06] and its Alex goes to high school.
[2837.96 → 2838.68] Probably not.
[2838.86 → 2839.10] Nope.
[2839.50 → 2839.72] Yeah.
[2839.88 → 2840.76] Probably not.
[2840.76 → 2841.24] All right.
[2841.24 → 2847.76] So basically Internet Explorer 12 UI overhauls is a blend of Chrome and Firefox adds extension
[2847.76 → 2849.96] support, which is pretty darn freaking cool.
[2849.96 → 2857.64] And Microsoft is allegedly discussing sort of past, past Internet Explorer 12 coming out
[2857.64 → 2863.10] with a browser that does not feature the Internet Explorer branding now, which might have one
[2863.10 → 2866.40] of the coolest code names ever, which has been a trend for Microsoft lately, but it might
[2866.40 → 2869.78] be called codename Spartan, which is pretty sick.
[2869.78 → 2870.52] I don't know.
[2870.60 → 2871.70] I like that kind of stuff.
[2871.82 → 2875.34] I like it when they bring back like the old Halo stuff, like how their, their voice
[2875.34 → 2876.36] AI is Cortana.
[2876.88 → 2878.08] Their new browser might be called Spartan.
[2878.08 → 2882.80] Let's latch on to the one hugely successful thing we did with the young demographic in
[2882.80 → 2884.88] the last 10 years.
[2886.68 → 2888.46] Nintendo releases a browser link.
[2888.46 → 2894.68] They release a security system, and it's just called like the master sword.
[2894.68 → 2897.84] As long as it's not like Nazi, then I'm going to...
[2897.84 → 2901.98] Can you imagine if their voice interaction system was Nazi?
[2902.22 → 2902.58] Hey!
[2902.78 → 2903.38] Shut up!
[2903.56 → 2904.14] Shut up!
[2904.62 → 2905.56] Please shut up!
[2905.56 → 2906.48] Open Google Docs!
[2906.84 → 2907.28] No!
[2907.28 → 2908.28] Um...
[2908.28 → 2912.72] Oh, that was probably the most annoying thing I've ever done on the show.
[2912.84 → 2921.02] So, so probably, uh, yeah, um, so probably they're not going to completely overhaul the
[2921.02 → 2926.78] underlying design of the browser, but it looks to me like it's probably just a timely rebranding.
[2927.16 → 2929.98] Honestly, Internet Explorer isn't that bad lately.
[2930.54 → 2934.84] It's just not, I mean, it's the kind of thing where it might not have a lot of the special
[2934.84 → 2941.20] exciting stuff, like really great extensions that Chrome does or Firefox does, but as a
[2941.20 → 2946.20] workhorse, if you want to go to a page, particularly like an educational page or something like
[2946.20 → 2949.48] that, Internet Explorer is the one that kind of just works for me.
[2949.90 → 2952.42] Educational pages are, uh, like login portals?
[2952.70 → 2952.90] Yeah.
[2953.16 → 2955.28] Login portals are a big, big thing.
[2955.42 → 2955.70] I've done it.
[2955.74 → 2957.22] What even was that?
[2957.26 → 2957.72] I don't know.
[2957.80 → 2958.58] That was a weird face.
[2958.58 → 2960.32] Just walked by really oddly.
[2963.20 → 2964.20] Don't even know what that is.
[2964.20 → 2965.58] We should just start calling that the Nick face.
[2965.76 → 2969.06] It's kind of like a combination of duck face and like popped out eyes.
[2969.18 → 2969.90] It's like.
[2974.50 → 2975.50] What a good guy.
[2975.84 → 2977.04] Why do we employ him?
[2977.12 → 2978.30] Nick is super weird.
[2979.48 → 2980.22] Good night, Ed.
[2980.76 → 2981.58] I'm not leaving yet.
[2981.76 → 2982.14] Okay.
[2982.38 → 2982.94] That's good.
[2984.28 → 2984.90] All right.
[2985.56 → 2985.92] Google.
[2986.44 → 2986.76] Okay.
[2986.76 → 2987.92] More Google topics.
[2987.92 → 2988.62] All right.
[2988.62 → 2990.48] This was posted by Victoria's Secret.
[2990.70 → 2993.54] I'm going to go ahead and pull up the CNN page here.
[2993.54 → 2998.06] So Google opposes the Marriott's plan to block Wi-Fi hotspots.
[2998.32 → 2999.86] You know what's funny about this?
[3000.12 → 3003.04] Is didn't the Marriott apologize for that BS?
[3004.90 → 3005.64] What BS?
[3006.00 → 3006.44] This?
[3006.70 → 3006.94] Yeah.
[3007.00 → 3010.60] The bit where they were blocking people's Wi-Fi hotspots without them knowing.
[3010.82 → 3011.42] I don't know.
[3011.70 → 3012.80] I didn't hear about this.
[3013.22 → 3013.38] Yeah.
[3013.42 → 3013.96] We talked about it on the show.
[3013.96 → 3015.48] Was this like a really long time ago?
[3015.56 → 3016.26] This was a while ago.
[3016.36 → 3018.04] I vaguely remember this.
[3018.42 → 3024.08] Marriott apologizes after being fined by the FCC for blocking customer Wi-Fi.
[3024.16 → 3024.26] Yeah.
[3024.32 → 3025.98] They apologized for this BS.
[3026.68 → 3026.86] Yeah.
[3026.88 → 3027.58] I remember this.
[3027.58 → 3030.28] So this is a post on FARC.com.
[3030.36 → 3032.10] So I don't think that's the most...
[3032.10 → 3034.10] How this...
[3034.10 → 3035.44] Read, write.com.
[3035.60 → 3035.76] Shoot.
[3035.84 → 3036.50] I wish I could...
[3036.50 → 3037.42] When was this?
[3037.62 → 3038.06] October.
[3038.36 → 3038.72] What?
[3038.98 → 3040.10] That seems way too recent.
[3040.38 → 3041.28] Or when was that FARC one?
[3041.36 → 3041.52] Yeah.
[3041.58 → 3041.92] October.
[3042.04 → 3042.24] Wow.
[3042.24 → 3042.84] Yeah.
[3042.92 → 3045.18] Well, this is them apologizing after being fined.
[3045.28 → 3047.38] So this whole thing went down before that.
[3048.10 → 3049.52] And so they apologized.
[3050.08 → 3055.50] And so now they're basically going, yeah, we're sorry that it was against the rules.
[3055.72 → 3059.58] So can we change the rules so that we can do this?
[3061.66 → 3062.90] Unpreaching believable.
[3063.04 → 3066.90] So basically their argument is just infuriating.
[3066.90 → 3075.08] If a customer arrives at a hotel with her own Mini device...
[3075.08 → 3075.56] Mini?
[3075.68 → 3075.86] Really?
[3075.92 → 3077.06] You're just inventing things now?
[3077.42 → 3082.68] And the hotel interferes with the customer's connection to that personal hotspot, the hotel...
[3082.68 → 3082.98] Oh, wait.
[3083.04 → 3083.30] Hold on.
[3083.32 → 3083.90] No, no, no, no, no.
[3083.92 → 3084.10] Sorry.
[3084.18 → 3085.08] This isn't their quote.
[3085.46 → 3085.76] Crap.
[3085.86 → 3086.60] Where's their thing?
[3088.26 → 3089.62] I don't think it's in these.
[3089.68 → 3089.82] Right.
[3089.90 → 3090.10] No, no.
[3090.10 → 3090.26] Sorry.
[3090.30 → 3090.56] Here it is.
[3090.62 → 3091.18] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3091.46 → 3095.54] Marriott and the hotel lobby argued that guests can use their smartphones...
[3095.54 → 3096.60] Sorry, I have to jump in again.
[3096.60 → 3097.12] Sorry, one second.
[3097.28 → 3099.18] I love how it's called the hotel lobby.
[3099.26 → 3099.50] I know.
[3101.58 → 3107.46] Argued that guests can use their smartphones or Mini devices to launch an attack against
[3107.46 → 3111.96] a hotel's Wi-Fi network or threaten other guests' privacy.
[3113.50 → 3115.28] What are you talking about?
[3116.46 → 3119.48] If you open an open network.
[3120.48 → 3121.52] If you post an open network.
[3121.52 → 3123.32] That's not threatening someone else's privacy.
[3123.34 → 3123.60] Okay.
[3123.92 → 3124.22] Okay.
[3124.30 → 3124.70] Yes.
[3124.70 → 3132.10] If you created an open network, and you were kind of spoofing something that looked official,
[3132.40 → 3136.66] you could create a login portal that looks kind of like it or whatever else.
[3137.08 → 3137.52] Okay.
[3138.32 → 3138.84] Yes.
[3138.84 → 3146.18] But I don't see any reason why the hotel couldn't monitor for something that appears to be spoofing
[3146.18 → 3149.40] versus something that is obviously not someone's personal Wi-Fi connection.
[3149.40 → 3153.54] But then you're just going to run into complications there with them claiming that it seemed like
[3153.54 → 3155.92] there was spoofing or some crap like that.
[3156.00 → 3160.74] Because there's also problems where even if they're not spoofing like the hotel Marriott's Wi-Fi,
[3160.74 → 3167.68] if someone just opens an unsecured network and is like, free internet, people are going to want to connect to it.
[3168.08 → 3169.06] So, okay.
[3169.38 → 3171.22] So I get that argument.
[3171.60 → 3172.04] I'm not.
[3172.20 → 3173.36] I don't agree with them at all.
[3173.44 → 3173.62] I want to make that clear.
[3173.62 → 3175.28] But the answer is really easy.
[3175.84 → 3179.94] My Wi-Fi should be included in what I just paid you for my room for the night.
[3180.26 → 3181.16] Get over yourselves.
[3181.68 → 3182.20] Thank you.
[3182.50 → 3183.00] That too.
[3183.18 → 3184.26] So basically the...
[3184.26 → 3187.20] And then there should just be a thing in the room saying like, connect to this exact SSID.
[3187.54 → 3187.74] Yep.
[3187.94 → 3188.88] Ignore other ones.
[3188.94 → 3189.88] I mean, I don't understand.
[3189.98 → 3190.46] You know what?
[3190.64 → 3192.38] Now that I think about it, the vast...
[3192.38 → 3193.66] And even then, people can still screw with you.
[3193.74 → 3199.20] Even when Wi-Fi is included with my hotel room, it's almost like they go out of their way to not bother...
[3199.20 → 3199.76] To make it slow.
[3200.00 → 3202.20] No, to not bother to tell me how to connect to it.
[3202.26 → 3202.62] No, no, no.
[3202.92 → 3209.16] Because some hotels do a pretty good job of this, where you just log in with your last name and your room number to get into the portal.
[3209.16 → 3214.06] And that's something that someone who's spoofing their connection wouldn't be able to do anyway.
[3215.48 → 3217.34] They wouldn't know your last name and your room number.
[3217.40 → 3218.24] Although they could just auto-let you in.
[3218.24 → 3219.14] They could just auto-let you in.
[3219.24 → 3219.34] Yeah.
[3219.34 → 3219.84] Okay, that's true.
[3220.74 → 3223.34] So anyway, but they have an easy way to do it.
[3223.38 → 3229.78] Whereas other ones, you have to go to the desk, you have to get them to give you a card, and it has like a one-time use password.
[3229.90 → 3232.00] And like that kind of thing is just inconvenient.
[3232.26 → 3233.78] It's like they don't even want you to use it.
[3234.36 → 3235.40] It's infuriating.
[3235.40 → 3243.18] Anyway, so basically, the flip side of this argument is if a customer arrives at a hotel with their own personal hotspot device,
[3243.68 → 3247.78] then effectively what the hotel's doing is forcing them to not use that.
[3247.94 → 3252.28] Even though they already paid their carrier for the right to use their device as a personal hotspot,
[3252.86 → 3259.20] they're forcing them to pay twice for the same capability to pay the hotel to use their Wi-Fi.
[3259.20 → 3260.52] Anyway, so yeah.
[3260.76 → 3261.44] Kind of ridiculous.
[3261.70 → 3263.90] This is ridiculous and stupid.
[3264.52 → 3267.86] And I mean, I'm sorry that people might get spoofed.
[3268.06 → 3270.38] That seems like a very uncommon thing.
[3270.58 → 3275.80] And it seems like also the kind of thing that someone would have to be physically on your premises doing.
[3276.14 → 3279.96] And wouldn't be that hard to track down who was doing it with video surveillance in the lobby
[3279.96 → 3282.86] and make sure that you're prosecuting that person correctly.
[3283.54 → 3284.98] Like, yeah.
[3285.90 → 3292.06] That seems like there are solutions other than locking down your customers from being able to bring their own Wi-Fi hotspots.
[3292.06 → 3294.66] Yeah, and that just needs to be a personal security thing.
[3295.08 → 3298.80] Like, people need to be aware that these are things and try to protect themselves.
[3299.02 → 3302.26] This isn't the hotel's job to protect people.
[3302.44 → 3304.50] And that's obviously not what they're doing anyway.
[3304.60 → 3306.48] They're just trying to get people to buy their freaking Wi-Fi.
[3307.12 → 3308.08] Like, come on.
[3308.08 → 3309.32] Cynicism hats on.
[3309.62 → 3311.30] Okay, we can take our cynicism hats off.
[3311.98 → 3317.48] GTX 960 is rumoured to be released on January 22nd.
[3317.58 → 3322.12] Although, although none of our sources for this are particularly concrete.
[3322.12 → 3325.22] But that makes sense because the concrete sources are going to be under NDA.
[3325.52 → 3327.58] I actually haven't heard anything about it.
[3327.66 → 3330.44] So, I'm just speculating on someone else's rumour.
[3330.54 → 3334.54] This was posted by, whoops, Brood on the forum.
[3334.64 → 3336.94] I'm going to go ahead and pull up the article from everybody's favourite.
[3338.08 → 3341.30] I'm doing this just to irk the forum people.
[3341.30 → 3343.12] I was wondering.
[3343.30 → 3347.46] So, I was like, that was a lot of callouts to the fact that you don't like that source.
[3347.84 → 3349.66] Like, normally there's like, oh, just be wary.
[3349.84 → 3350.56] But this one was like.
[3350.56 → 3356.34] So, it looks like if the rumoured specs are correct, it'll be around a $200 price point.
[3356.66 → 3360.06] It'll have the, oh, GM206.
[3361.02 → 3361.50] Whoa.
[3362.28 → 3362.62] Okay.
[3362.70 → 3363.96] I didn't know that was happening.
[3364.20 → 3365.38] I actually misread this.
[3365.38 → 3366.90] I thought it was GM204.
[3367.34 → 3373.68] Because if it was GM204, then it would be an extremely cut down chip versus the GTX 970 and 980.
[3373.80 → 3374.98] But it would be the same chip.
[3375.50 → 3380.50] But this could be its own fully enabled 128-bit GM206 chip.
[3380.50 → 3398.92] So, just to put this in perspective, NVIDIA has effectively, over the last couple generations of products, worked their way, worked their less, their smaller, less expensive dies, several, like, it looks like about two bumps up the product stack.
[3398.92 → 3408.54] So, it used to be that an X04 chip would have been a 960, 950, or like an X60, X50 product.
[3408.70 → 3413.44] And that is now an X70, X80, every other generation if the pattern continues.
[3413.80 → 3419.88] And then an X06 chip would have normally been, like, very low end.
[3420.00 → 3425.86] Like, that would have been under, probably under something 50 Ti.
[3425.86 → 3429.86] Like, it would be, like, a vanilla version of that or somewhere like that in the product stack.
[3430.00 → 3434.42] So, this could be a very, very affordable chip for NVIDIA to make.
[3434.54 → 3436.90] Could be a very, very affordable chip for you to buy.
[3437.06 → 3443.36] And if it's Maxwell-based, which, of course, it will be, then the performance should actually be perfect and it should be very efficient.
[3443.46 → 3447.36] It's rumoured to have only a single PCI Express 6-pin power connector.
[3448.62 → 3451.86] Which is not too surprising, if you think about it.
[3452.42 → 3452.60] Yeah.
[3452.60 → 3454.48] None of this was all that surprising.
[3454.48 → 3457.20] I think the 206 thing is pretty cool.
[3457.34 → 3466.18] I really hope that a 960 Ti, which is sort of speculated to also be in the works, I hope that a 960 Ti would also be GM204-based.
[3466.90 → 3475.62] Maybe cut down to 192-bit and then maybe cut down, maybe much lower clock speed, maybe turn off some more CUBA cores or something like that.
[3475.66 → 3480.50] Mind you, by the time you cut it down enough, I mean, GM206 might be competitive with it at that point.
[3480.50 → 3482.60] So, we'll have to see once it gets on a bench.
[3482.78 → 3483.54] Pretty excited for that.
[3483.62 → 3484.58] I like graphics card launches.
[3484.78 → 3485.30] Yeah, me too.
[3485.56 → 3487.42] Especially the affordable ones are always fun.
[3487.72 → 3487.88] Yes, yeah.
[3487.92 → 3495.24] Because, like, as much as we love covering, you know, Titan, Uber edition or whatever, we know that most of you people aren't buying that.
[3495.76 → 3495.92] So...
[3495.92 → 3498.10] Speaking of which, go watch the motherboard videos.
[3498.36 → 3499.28] Oh, yeah, that's right.
[3499.28 → 3501.12] And interesting ones are going to be the next two.
[3501.28 → 3501.46] Yeah.
[3501.72 → 3504.14] So, I've had people be like, this series is useless.
[3504.30 → 3507.02] But then I've also had people be like, thank you, this is amazing.
[3507.26 → 3515.20] So, those of you that are saying this series is useless, I think you guys will start having your answers in the next two because we'll be covering stuff like BIOS usability.
[3515.52 → 3517.76] What you can do, how easily can you do it.
[3517.76 → 3523.06] And then the next one after that will be finished systems, so more once you're in the operating system, so different utilities that they have.
[3523.16 → 3531.42] And for the really clever folks among you, you might be able to read between the lines a little bit and see that this isn't just about these exact motherboards.
[3531.42 → 3548.06] This is, as we get deeper into BIOS issues, compatibility and stuff like that, this is going to be more of an investigation into who is doing a good job developing motherboard products and making them easy and pleasant to use for the user out of these four brands.
[3548.18 → 3550.06] It's not necessarily just about these models.
[3550.32 → 3550.36] Yeah.
[3550.36 → 3555.70] We picked a price point, and we picked four brands and told them to give us their best shot.
[3556.08 → 3557.34] That's what we're looking at here.
[3557.34 → 3561.60] And we are definitely at a new all-time high for concurrent WAN Show viewers.
[3562.04 → 3565.30] I don't know if you've had an eye on this, but holy crap.
[3565.42 → 3566.44] I don't know what the heck happened.
[3566.46 → 3567.46] Are we front-paged?
[3567.48 → 3568.04] No, we're not.
[3568.14 → 3568.40] I checked.
[3568.42 → 3568.92] Or something?
[3569.26 → 3569.66] No.
[3570.22 → 3573.34] We have 7,800 viewers watching WAN Show.
[3573.44 → 3575.36] You guys are freaking awesome.
[3576.04 → 3576.94] And we love you all.
[3576.94 → 3577.48] There's a whole time.
[3577.48 → 3582.54] I don't know if you've noticed, but I keep on opening the front page again, just being like, wait, did it happen this time?
[3582.96 → 3584.04] Because it keeps going up.
[3584.04 → 3585.50] It's not even a holiday today.
[3585.50 → 3586.76] Like, I don't even understand.
[3587.92 → 3588.28] Whatever.
[3588.42 → 3589.18] You guys are awesome.
[3589.90 → 3596.88] Speaking of awesome, Kim.com's mega to launch anti-spying call and chat service, quote unquote, soon.
[3596.98 → 3598.98] This was posted by DLF on the forum.
[3599.30 → 3600.66] Want to go ahead and post a link for them?
[3600.74 → 3602.96] I think I'll pull up the PC World one, I guess?
[3603.22 → 3604.92] I just always post the line as I think it was like.
[3605.32 → 3605.76] Oh, okay.
[3605.88 → 3606.02] Sure.
[3606.06 → 3606.54] That's fine, too.
[3606.54 → 3613.06] So, basically, Kim.com came out and criticized, actually, very strongly.
[3613.22 → 3613.60] Oh, yeah.
[3613.82 → 3626.26] The existing chat clients that are out there saying that you shouldn't trust any U.S.-based chat company with your chats and your personal information and your personal data.
[3626.26 → 3630.42] And this page isn't loading, so we'll have to give it a sec.
[3630.52 → 3631.46] Mine is working fine.
[3632.02 → 3633.02] Yeah, don't worry about it.
[3633.02 → 3639.06] So, basically, came out and criticized all the existing services, named Skype specifically.
[3639.06 → 3646.28] And I got no problem with singling out Skype because Skype is the least secure piece of crap.
[3648.18 → 3648.62] Correct.
[3651.02 → 3654.90] WhatsApp actually did add end-to-end encryption late this year.
[3655.28 → 3656.72] Or last year, I guess, by now.
[3657.24 → 3657.64] Yay!
[3657.98 → 3659.24] Last year, it's 2015!
[3659.90 → 3660.56] Corner party!
[3661.00 → 3661.90] We're not in the corner.
[3661.98 → 3662.86] Hold on, let's get in the corner.
[3664.22 → 3667.46] Oh, this page still isn't loading, so I can't even screen share with you.
[3667.46 → 3668.06] I think I figured it out.
[3668.06 → 3668.54] What's up?
[3669.46 → 3680.72] Mine's working totally fine, but the link that we had in the doc was a repost because someone's a butt, so I'm going to post the proper original topic now.
[3680.94 → 3681.48] Yeah, no problem.
[3681.58 → 3684.88] Although, I still don't know why yours isn't loading because it's working totally fine on mine.
[3684.94 → 3685.84] I'm going to throw this link right there.
[3685.84 → 3686.80] I think it's just that site.
[3686.94 → 3687.40] Right there.
[3688.18 → 3688.42] Okay.
[3688.54 → 3689.94] Oh, because you're not going to...
[3689.94 → 3690.82] Oh, I thought you were doing our website.
[3690.82 → 3692.12] Yeah, no, I'm not on the same connection as you.
[3692.14 → 3693.16] It's like, my website's fine.
[3693.38 → 3694.14] Yeah, no, no, it's all good.
[3694.18 → 3694.94] No, no, no, you're...
[3694.94 → 3695.46] Don't worry.
[3696.26 → 3697.44] Your website is working.
[3698.06 → 3698.54] Yeah.
[3700.54 → 3704.46] So anyway, fully encrypted browser-based video call and chat service.
[3704.64 → 3708.14] So this frees you from the clutches of Google, assuming you trust Mega.
[3708.76 → 3710.08] Maybe you do, maybe you don't.
[3710.16 → 3710.54] I don't know.
[3712.22 → 3713.12] I'm interested in it.
[3713.52 → 3713.96] Yeah.
[3714.34 → 3714.60] Yeah.
[3714.80 → 3716.32] I guess that's really all there is to say about it.
[3716.34 → 3717.18] It'll be called Mega Chat.
[3717.76 → 3717.96] Yeah.
[3717.96 → 3719.82] I just wish MSN would come back.
[3719.82 → 3720.14] It's the most creative thing ever.
[3720.42 → 3724.26] I saw my dad has a wireless keyboard for his home theatre setup.
[3724.42 → 3724.56] Yeah.
[3724.56 → 3726.70] And I saw a little MSN Messenger button on it.
[3726.70 → 3726.80] Oh.
[3726.88 → 3731.06] And I just stared at it for a little while and was like, please, please come back.
[3731.42 → 3732.62] You are so much better.
[3732.92 → 3733.34] I know.
[3733.40 → 3734.08] Oh, man.
[3734.22 → 3736.20] And like, there was voice capability in everything.
[3736.58 → 3736.84] I know.
[3736.90 → 3738.20] They even had video at the end.
[3738.26 → 3738.56] Yeah.
[3738.88 → 3739.82] There's no reason.
[3739.82 → 3743.96] They had like, they had liked your, your MSN Messenger, like profile page.
[3744.08 → 3748.46] Like back when, back when social networks were just starting up, like Microsoft crapped
[3748.46 → 3753.86] the bed on having the largest installation base on what was effectively a social network.
[3754.82 → 3755.78] They had it.
[3755.88 → 3756.62] They totally had it.
[3756.64 → 3757.36] It was game over.
[3757.52 → 3757.68] Yeah.
[3757.72 → 3759.84] And ICQ, you could say the same thing about them.
[3760.12 → 3761.16] Completely crapped the bed.
[3761.24 → 3762.28] AOL, same thing.
[3762.34 → 3768.00] It's like each one of those in their time was number one, was way ahead of this social
[3768.00 → 3768.68] networking game.
[3768.68 → 3773.74] And guys like Facebook come out of nowhere and have to play catch up on the messaging
[3773.74 → 3774.06] app.
[3774.08 → 3774.48] And still win.
[3774.50 → 3775.48] And it's still terrible.
[3775.62 → 3777.56] And the SNN is still better than Facebook Messenger.
[3777.76 → 3782.68] All I even use Facebook for right now is group networking so I can plan events with different
[3782.68 → 3784.18] groups that I have and chat.
[3784.58 → 3784.78] Yep.
[3784.78 → 3785.54] That's it.
[3785.92 → 3788.10] News, no news feed, none of that junk.
[3788.24 → 3791.88] Just chat and groups, which were already implemented years ago.
[3792.36 → 3793.10] Group chats.
[3793.26 → 3793.62] Oh, wait.
[3793.62 → 3794.76] We don't even need it for that.
[3795.60 → 3796.06] All right.
[3796.06 → 3801.08] So this was posted by Dietrich W on the forum, and it's from macrumors.com.
[3801.52 → 3808.18] Apple getting hit with a class action lawsuit over large iOS 8 storage requirements.
[3809.38 → 3810.68] Holy crap.
[3810.90 → 3813.82] I mean, cynicism hat back on.
[3813.82 → 3818.94] Because class action lawsuits benefit absolutely nobody but lawyers.
[3819.88 → 3825.26] Nobody but a lawyer benefits from a class action lawsuit because the number of plaintiffs
[3825.26 → 3831.76] is so large and the reward that goes to each of them is so small that it ends up being a
[3831.76 → 3832.66] very large settlement.
[3832.66 → 3838.36] So once the lawyer takes their cut, that's a huge chunk of money and then everyone who
[3838.36 → 3844.42] participated in the class action lawsuit gets like their $6 and a coupon or whatever the
[3844.42 → 3845.24] settlement ends up being.
[3845.38 → 3847.92] Like what was that Intel one recently over the faked benchmarks?
[3848.08 → 3849.40] Like $22 or something?
[3849.46 → 3850.12] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3850.12 → 3859.44] So basically the argument here is that Apple does not limit the size of their iOS 8 or their
[3859.44 → 3865.32] other OS updates that they roll out to these phones, and it could be taking up more storage,
[3865.46 → 3869.64] more than the user is aware of than it did when they first bought the device.
[3869.92 → 3875.68] And you know what I have to say to that stupid lawyer who is a bad, basically a bad person,
[3875.68 → 3881.56] is how about we all be thankful that Apple provides OS updates to their older devices so that we get
[3881.56 → 3884.40] updated feature sets, and so we get the latest security patches.
[3884.66 → 3885.12] How about that?
[3885.26 → 3890.76] How about we say thank you, Apple that my iPhone 4 only just recently stopped getting updates
[3890.76 → 3896.06] when Android phones from that era are still stuck on like gingerbread?
[3897.32 → 3897.98] How about that?
[3898.06 → 3898.56] What do you think?
[3898.92 → 3903.22] How about we say thank you, Apple, for supporting your devices instead of being complete buttheads
[3903.22 → 3911.16] and turning it into like, and of course there's this totally, totally romanticized version
[3911.16 → 3914.04] of how devastating this is to the user.
[3914.24 → 3918.80] Like they're at a wedding, and they can't capture that moment because their storage is full.
[3919.04 → 3919.54] You know what?
[3919.76 → 3924.78] Oh, and then Apple will opportunistically sell more storage to them through iCloud.
[3925.28 → 3927.28] You know, they should have thought of that before.
[3927.48 → 3928.36] Can I help you?
[3928.74 → 3929.74] Just taking this laptop.
[3930.82 → 3931.24] All right.
[3931.24 → 3934.04] So confused.
[3934.16 → 3934.94] Carry on soldier.
[3936.82 → 3937.78] So, right.
[3938.00 → 3938.82] So, yeah.
[3938.92 → 3943.66] So anyway, they, so they're, they're pitching it as this like absolute worst case scenario.
[3943.80 → 3944.20] You know what?
[3944.30 → 3947.92] Another option would be to empty your phone once in a while and make sure you actually
[3947.92 → 3949.66] have some space on it before you go to a wedding.
[3949.76 → 3954.34] Now, with that said, I really would appreciate it if Apple would start putting expandable storage
[3954.34 → 3956.82] in their devices because it really doesn't seem like that big of a deal.
[3956.82 → 3958.26] But, um.
[3958.78 → 3959.62] And like, yeah.
[3959.78 → 3960.72] Storage capacity sucks.
[3960.82 → 3963.46] But exactly like he said, just start managing your data.
[3963.50 → 3966.84] Let's stop suing companies over doing the right thing.
[3967.00 → 3972.88] Even if they did display the amount that the update took.
[3973.00 → 3974.96] Even if they were like, you only have this much available.
[3974.96 → 3978.12] You'd still hit the cap.
[3978.46 → 3982.40] Knowing like, I have this exact data, and I've taken this exact amount of photos and have
[3982.40 → 3983.66] this exact many songs.
[3983.76 → 3985.98] Like, you're not going to do that calculation in your freaking head.
[3986.26 → 3988.98] You would check your system storage settings anyway.
[3989.82 → 3990.80] Get over yourself.
[3990.80 → 3992.80] 8,000 people.
[3992.80 → 3992.82] All right.
[3992.82 → 3994.24] So, I think that's.
[3994.40 → 3994.58] Sorry?
[3994.78 → 3995.30] 8,000 people.
[3995.30 → 3995.70] I know.
[3995.88 → 3996.24] Well, no.
[3996.32 → 4003.62] I was trying to find something that I could kind of click on so we could.
[4003.70 → 4003.96] Okay.
[4004.04 → 4004.40] Here we go.
[4004.46 → 4004.66] Whatever.
[4004.84 → 4007.40] Asus Zen phone allegedly coming.
[4007.52 → 4013.66] So, the source is Android Police and this was posted by that cool blue kid on the forum.
[4014.02 → 4015.58] So, I wanted to have a corner party.
[4016.42 → 4016.70] No!
[4016.70 → 4020.70] That's why you wanted to do that.
[4020.80 → 4021.68] The last corner party.
[4021.78 → 4022.50] What was that for?
[4022.60 → 4023.12] I don't remember.
[4023.90 → 4024.32] Oh, no.
[4024.34 → 4025.28] It was for lots of viewers.
[4025.38 → 4025.58] Yeah.
[4025.68 → 4027.12] But, I don't remember how many it was for.
[4027.34 → 4029.00] It was for less than 8,000.
[4029.18 → 4029.40] Yes.
[4029.70 → 4030.16] That is for.
[4030.16 → 4030.46] Over 8.
[4030.52 → 4030.88] Oh.
[4031.16 → 4031.86] Oh, my goodness.
[4031.96 → 4035.32] We have to do something special when we go over 9,000 for the first time.
[4035.32 → 4036.42] We should get like.
[4036.80 → 4036.92] Okay.
[4036.96 → 4037.32] I'm going to.
[4037.78 → 4039.42] Should I keep this idea under wraps?
[4039.42 → 4039.46] Yeah.
[4039.46 → 4039.64] Yeah.
[4039.76 → 4040.80] Keep the idea under wraps.
[4040.94 → 4041.72] We'll figure it out.
[4041.78 → 4042.42] We'll figure it out.
[4042.50 → 4046.68] We'll have to incentivize everyone who's watching to like share the stream and be like,
[4046.70 → 4047.90] look, just tune into the stream.
[4047.96 → 4048.54] Don't worry about it.
[4048.60 → 4049.32] Watch it happen.
[4049.60 → 4050.32] Not that I think it will.
[4050.40 → 4053.22] But, watch it happen during the show, and we're just completely unprepared.
[4053.28 → 4053.58] No, no.
[4053.60 → 4054.18] Don't do it now.
[4054.26 → 4054.96] We're not ready yet.
[4055.02 → 4055.68] We're not ready yet.
[4056.46 → 4056.92] All right.
[4056.98 → 4062.42] So, ASUS is teasing their new Zen phone to be unveiled at CES saying, see what others
[4062.42 → 4063.56] can't see.
[4063.80 → 4066.80] And, I think the video is very cryptic.
[4066.86 → 4070.98] But, the rumour is that we could be looking at a very different kind of dual camera setup
[4070.98 → 4073.54] than we've seen before in the past.
[4074.00 → 4078.38] So, as you'll see below, the device itself couldn't possibly have these two lenses if
[4078.38 → 4081.42] that's what they are, arranged side-by-side when held in portrait mode.
[4081.48 → 4084.92] In fact, the screenshot above looks like it may just be a product of a post-production
[4084.92 → 4086.52] mirroring effect on the single lens.
[4086.60 → 4087.40] Something, something, something.
[4087.40 → 4092.24] Something, I think one of the rumours is that we might be looking at a camera with optical
[4092.24 → 4094.04] zoom or something along those lines.
[4094.14 → 4095.20] So, that would be kind of cool.
[4098.14 → 4098.50] Yeah.
[4098.94 → 4099.34] I don't know.
[4099.44 → 4099.74] We'll see.
[4100.82 → 4101.96] We can watch the video if we want.
[4103.06 → 4104.52] Oh, you'll be seeing this.
[4104.62 → 4105.76] I liked the Pad Phone X.
[4105.86 → 4106.02] Yeah.
[4106.12 → 4106.26] Yeah.
[4106.26 → 4106.92] I'll be checking this out.
[4107.42 → 4108.86] I liked the Pad Phone X.
[4108.92 → 4112.48] The only issue I have with it is that mine is locked to AT&T.
[4112.48 → 4116.82] So, I'm Canadian and AT&T refuses to unlock it for me.
[4116.92 → 4117.16] Yeah.
[4117.58 → 4119.42] So, I was just like, okay.
[4120.90 → 4123.08] I cannot be a customer of yours.
[4123.20 → 4124.44] It is not possible.
[4124.98 → 4126.68] We cannot unlock it for you.
[4126.74 → 4127.74] I'm like, yes, you can.
[4128.10 → 4128.88] You just won't.
[4129.42 → 4129.64] Yeah.
[4129.78 → 4130.94] They're like, yes.
[4134.94 → 4135.70] Oh, man.
[4135.70 → 4136.60] So, yeah.
[4136.92 → 4138.54] I mean, Asus is one of those companies.
[4139.36 → 4145.70] They'll screw it up and screw it up and screw it up and half-ass it and half-ass it and then
[4145.70 → 4149.30] be almost there and then be almost there, and then they'll just take over.
[4150.66 → 4152.76] They have the manufacturing know-how.
[4152.76 → 4158.44] What they usually lack is the industrial design, but they've gotten a lot better at that in the
[4158.44 → 4159.10] last few years.
[4159.48 → 4162.62] And I'm excited to see what they come out with the new Zen Phone.
[4162.62 → 4167.86] Bitcoin deemed the worst currency of 2014.
[4168.10 → 4170.18] This was posted by Big Drowns on the forum.
[4170.72 → 4175.16] I mean, I still wish I'd had some Bitcoins back when it was above $1,000, but since then
[4175.16 → 4177.42] it has dropped to just around $320.
[4178.04 → 4184.70] I mean, anyone who kind of could predict the future would have known that something like
[4184.70 → 4185.80] this was going to happen anyway.
[4185.94 → 4188.32] It wasn't going to keep rising like this.
[4188.32 → 4196.16] And settling in at $320, if it can stay settled, is just fine because that's what it needs
[4196.16 → 4197.28] to be a currency.
[4197.54 → 4202.70] It needs to not be rising really fast, just as much as it needs to not be falling really
[4202.70 → 4203.00] fast.
[4203.00 → 4206.34] It just needs to establish a value and stay there.
[4206.44 → 4209.92] So, that whole gold rush thing was totally harmful to Bitcoin.
[4209.92 → 4210.92] Bitcoin.
[4210.92 → 4213.92] And if it's ever to have a chance, it needs to just...
[4213.92 → 4219.88] Even if the Bitcoin value dropped to $100 or $50, as long as it settles in somewhere,
[4219.88 → 4223.64] and people know what it's going to be worth, then they can trade with it.
[4223.64 → 4226.08] Because right now, it's just a complete mess.
[4226.46 → 4226.86] Ridiculous.
[4228.80 → 4230.20] Do we have anything else for today?
[4230.30 → 4231.06] Or is this just a short show?
[4231.06 → 4234.12] Someone linked this screenshot and said, what do you mean MSN's gone?
[4234.12 → 4236.12] There's still...
[4236.12 → 4239.12] I think you can still use the client with like...
[4239.12 → 4242.44] And I think it's not gone in all territories.
[4243.06 → 4244.26] It's not gone in all regions.
[4244.36 → 4245.10] Like, it's complicated.
[4245.32 → 4251.10] The gradual killing off of the service has been in progress for quite some time.
[4251.16 → 4251.34] Okay.
[4251.54 → 4251.78] Yeah.
[4252.06 → 4253.34] Because I got kind of excited.
[4254.14 → 4254.44] No.
[4254.72 → 4256.36] I was like, was there some way I can do this?
[4256.36 → 4258.94] And the problem would be related to other things.
[4259.14 → 4260.86] Like, there'd be no security on it.
[4260.94 → 4262.00] There'd be a lot of spam on it.
[4262.06 → 4262.94] Like, it's not being maintained.
[4263.24 → 4263.40] Yeah.
[4264.12 → 4264.66] So, yeah.
[4265.04 → 4267.62] Apparently, there's a base amount for iMacs now.
[4267.74 → 4267.90] Yeah.
[4268.00 → 4268.92] Newrutech.com.
[4269.04 → 4270.16] Because I complained a lot...
[4270.16 → 4270.62] Oh, wow.
[4270.68 → 4272.08] This is the stupidest thing ever.
[4272.42 → 4274.12] I haven't actually looked at this yet.
[4274.20 → 4278.38] It's like engineering a solution to a problem that should not exist.
[4279.90 → 4280.30] Oh.
[4281.26 → 4281.64] Really?
[4281.92 → 4283.92] The largest, most ridiculous thing ever.
[4284.28 → 4285.86] And it leaves the leg on it.
[4285.98 → 4290.08] So, you actually have to just leave the foot on the new iMac.
[4290.30 → 4292.30] You can use it as like a phone tray.
[4292.98 → 4296.48] You know those things that they have where you plug your phone into the wall?
[4296.92 → 4297.12] Yes.
[4297.76 → 4298.34] It's like...
[4299.34 → 4300.18] That's stupid.
[4300.18 → 4301.80] Now, built into your iMac.
[4302.44 → 4303.44] Aluminum design.
[4305.06 → 4305.86] Because, you know, I...
[4305.86 → 4307.46] You wanted a high build quality phone stand.
[4307.46 → 4314.48] I had people giving me crap in my iPhone or my iMac teardown where I was saying that I
[4314.48 → 4318.66] think it's totally asinine that Apple doesn't allow the stand to be removed and swapped for
[4318.66 → 4320.48] a base amount like it did with the old ones.
[4320.74 → 4320.82] Yeah.
[4320.82 → 4322.82] Now, you have to decide at the time of ordering.
[4323.08 → 4325.00] And people are saying, no, no, Linus, there's a base amount.
[4325.28 → 4326.94] This does not count.
[4328.00 → 4329.40] That is stupid.
[4332.34 → 4334.80] Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[4334.80 → 4337.92] And Apple needs to get their crap together.
[4338.18 → 4341.08] Like, that's not even an degradability thing.
[4341.18 → 4342.46] That's just common sense.
[4342.64 → 4344.58] Monitors should go on base amounts.
[4345.28 → 4346.06] And, yeah.
[4346.52 → 4348.00] We're almost at 8,300.
[4348.66 → 4349.14] What?
[4350.36 → 4351.30] That's incredible.
[4351.46 → 4353.22] We're not just beating our previous record.
[4353.36 → 4354.54] We're just wrecking it.
[4354.84 → 4355.56] Crushing it.
[4356.20 → 4357.16] Absolutely ridiculous.
[4357.98 → 4358.38] Monstrous.
[4358.76 → 4359.10] All right.
[4359.10 → 4364.54] So, this has apparently been redacted, but the internet was pretty excited about it momentarily.
[4364.70 → 4370.06] I think, okay, so I've been speculating for quite a while that it would be Q4, maybe Q3,
[4370.18 → 4371.12] but probably Q4.
[4371.22 → 4372.56] So, this wasn't too surprising.
[4373.22 → 4378.78] But I have a theory that part of the reason why it was redacted was they probably want it
[4378.78 → 4379.80] to be a big thing at CES.
[4381.06 → 4383.90] I'm wondering if that's going to be an announcement at CES.
[4384.06 → 4384.28] Right.
[4384.28 → 4384.32] Okay.
[4385.10 → 4388.32] So, basically, he was...
[4388.32 → 4393.90] So, Palmer was quoted as saying that the consumer version of the Oculus Rift would be released,
[4394.06 → 4395.72] what was it, winter 2015?
[4395.72 → 4397.22] Winter 2015, yeah.
[4397.32 → 4405.46] That has since been changed to late 2015, early 2016, I think, is the new quote that's
[4405.46 → 4407.24] been replaced in the article.
[4407.42 → 4408.92] And, honestly, I wouldn't be surprised either.
[4409.30 → 4409.70] It's...
[4409.70 → 4410.46] It's...
[4410.46 → 4410.72] Yeah.
[4411.88 → 4412.54] I don't know.
[4412.54 → 4418.42] They need to super-duper make sure that their first consumer version is 100% okay.
[4418.98 → 4419.10] Yeah.
[4419.24 → 4423.28] Because if there are any problems with their first consumer version, that's going to cause
[4423.28 → 4425.62] serious issues for the VR community as a whole.
[4425.90 → 4426.02] Yeah.
[4426.02 → 4432.04] We need the first consumer version from the massive frontrunners to be a very, very good
[4432.04 → 4433.96] success for the entire industry.
[4434.12 → 4436.16] I'm so stoked to play Valkyrie.
[4437.04 → 4437.36] Mm-hmm.
[4437.64 → 4438.56] Like, so stoked.
[4438.66 → 4439.50] Valkyrie will be sick.
[4439.50 → 4444.16] I'm excited for something that I'm not going to tell you guys a ton of yet, but a company
[4444.16 → 4449.08] that I'll be going and seeing at CES that has a VR-AR mixed headset.
[4449.42 → 4450.34] That should be really cool.
[4450.40 → 4450.68] Hopefully.
[4450.92 → 4451.28] We'll see.
[4452.72 → 4454.78] Well, I guess that's pretty much...
[4454.78 → 4457.92] That's pretty much it for today.
[4457.92 → 4464.08] Oh, there was one thing that I told this company that I would talk about briefly on the show.
[4465.08 → 4465.82] No, not that.
[4467.62 → 4468.50] I thought it was three...
[4468.50 → 4470.64] So this is actually...
[4470.64 → 4473.12] Here, I'll load up the site.
[4473.34 → 4474.68] I don't even know how to pronounce it.
[4475.14 → 4476.16] But I get contacted...
[4476.16 → 4476.44] Vessel?
[4477.36 → 4479.82] I don't know, because Vessel would have two S's, right?
[4480.08 → 4481.66] Yeah, but...
[4481.66 → 4482.08] I don't know.
[4482.94 → 4483.88] Companies do that a lot.
[4484.84 → 4485.24] Okay.
[4485.48 → 4485.94] Here we go.
[4485.94 → 4487.64] So, Vessel case.
[4488.48 → 4491.96] These guys contacted me, and they were like,
[4492.06 → 4495.42] Yeah, we have this super high-quality iPhone 6 case.
[4495.76 → 4499.36] We think you'll be really, really impressed with it, and we want you to review it.
[4499.36 → 4499.86] And I kind of went,
[4499.92 → 4506.12] Well, I don't really review phone cases, because what is there to say about a phone case?
[4506.86 → 4507.62] Not a lot.
[4507.62 → 4510.24] So, basically what I said was,
[4510.36 → 4511.58] Look, I'm not going to review it,
[4511.94 → 4513.52] but what I will do is,
[4513.60 → 4514.60] If you guys want to send one,
[4514.72 → 4515.52] I will try it,
[4515.92 → 4517.58] and I will, like,
[4517.88 → 4519.92] open it and put it on my phone on the podcast,
[4520.64 → 4522.42] and I will give people my thoughts on it.
[4522.50 → 4524.96] So, my initial reaction...
[4524.96 → 4526.86] Here, I'll hold this up a little bit closer for you.
[4526.90 → 4528.54] Actually, you know what I could probably do?
[4529.22 → 4530.58] Is add...
[4531.32 → 4532.18] Can you be my cameraman?
[4532.66 → 4532.94] Yeah.
[4533.34 → 4534.50] It'll be like the old days.
[4534.72 → 4534.98] Yeah.
[4535.06 → 4535.82] This is so exciting.
[4535.82 → 4538.10] Didn't we do something fairly recently?
[4538.78 → 4539.36] I don't remember.
[4539.60 → 4539.96] Whoa.
[4540.80 → 4542.10] Okay, this is going to be fairly difficult,
[4542.28 → 4543.06] because of the cable.
[4543.20 → 4544.74] Don't worry, you got this, bro.
[4545.66 → 4546.90] And I have no viewfinder.
[4547.56 → 4548.30] Hold on, hold on.
[4548.48 → 4551.42] I got to change the output size.
[4551.60 → 4555.64] We need this camera putting out at 1920x1080.
[4555.74 → 4556.02] All right.
[4556.58 → 4558.02] So, here you go.
[4558.92 → 4562.00] I told them I'd do, like, a live unboxing on the WAN show.
[4562.10 → 4563.16] So, this is the case.
[4563.16 → 4566.12] You can choose your wood finish.
[4566.22 → 4569.32] I believe I went with space gray slash walnut.
[4570.14 → 4574.88] So, there's little pins that hold together the corners here.
[4575.10 → 4575.86] There we go.
[4575.98 → 4576.10] Yeah.
[4576.26 → 4576.82] Oh, yeah.
[4577.10 → 4579.04] That depth of field, bro.
[4579.32 → 4579.80] Oh, come on.
[4579.84 → 4580.10] Focus.
[4580.74 → 4581.14] Focus.
[4581.30 → 4582.50] I have no manual control.
[4582.94 → 4583.42] There we go.
[4583.52 → 4585.12] If I hold my hand there, then we can see it.
[4585.46 → 4585.68] All right.
[4585.74 → 4586.68] So, those are in their like that.
[4586.68 → 4591.00] So, the construction is all, like, metal-y and sexy and stuff.
[4591.08 → 4593.12] And then the buttons kind of go through the thing.
[4593.24 → 4595.36] And there's like a, I don't know, a phone or something there.
[4595.42 → 4595.58] Okay.
[4595.62 → 4597.36] Anyway, let's put it on the phone.
[4600.08 → 4603.18] And so, my initial reaction was like, oh, yeah, this seems pretty cool.
[4603.30 → 4604.76] I've actually had it on my phone already.
[4604.84 → 4605.24] I cheated.
[4605.40 → 4606.66] I unboxed it without you guys.
[4606.66 → 4611.60] Now, I'm a little bit worried because I had it on before and I had to take it off because
[4611.60 → 4614.40] I had to put something else on my iPhone 6.
[4615.32 → 4620.56] But anyway, the way that you put it together is then you put the last screw in this corner.
[4620.70 → 4621.70] So, I'm going to go ahead and do that.
[4622.08 → 4625.34] And it comes with this little tool, which is actually pretty cool.
[4625.94 → 4626.76] Vesselcase.com.
[4627.16 → 4628.20] And I hope, yes, I did.
[4628.26 → 4629.12] I put the screw there.
[4629.44 → 4634.36] So, it comes with its own, there, its own little, like, socket thing.
[4634.82 → 4635.98] And then it's got a little cap on it.
[4635.98 → 4639.62] And I guess you could store that on your keychain if you felt like you might need to take your
[4639.62 → 4641.72] case off your phone very frequently.
[4643.22 → 4646.50] Like, are these, like, premium bumpers becoming more popular?
[4647.36 → 4650.44] Because I have to confess, I was not really aware of that.
[4650.44 → 4652.06] Bumpers are only really an iPhone thing, right?
[4652.40 → 4653.06] I think so.
[4653.36 → 4654.48] Yeah, so I have no idea.
[4655.04 → 4655.44] Right.
[4658.50 → 4659.36] Not a clue.
[4659.74 → 4661.26] Let's see if I can do this.
[4661.62 → 4662.66] I'm having trouble now.
[4663.06 → 4665.00] Of course I have trouble when I try and do it on camera.
[4665.00 → 4667.02] It's like, Murphy's freaking law, right?
[4667.70 → 4669.46] This is a really weird way to film something.
[4669.60 → 4670.24] Dang, Murphy.
[4671.24 → 4671.48] Ah.
[4671.76 → 4672.08] Anyway.
[4672.42 → 4674.74] So, I was like, yeah, this seems pretty cool.
[4675.14 → 4677.68] But I have to say, I wasn't that impressed with the price.
[4678.26 → 4681.44] This thing is a hundred and...
[4681.44 → 4681.60] Twenty?
[4682.24 → 4682.62] Sorry?
[4682.88 → 4683.24] 120?
[4683.66 → 4684.32] Hold on, hold on.
[4684.38 → 4684.76] It gets...
[4684.76 → 4687.02] My first guess before you even started saying it priced was a hundred.
[4687.06 → 4689.32] It's a hundred and thirty-eight euros.
[4689.92 → 4690.40] Euros!
[4690.40 → 4691.98] Oh, no!
[4692.98 → 4693.46] That's...
[4693.46 → 4694.86] Okay, that's a lot worse.
[4695.40 → 4696.52] Yeah, so...
[4696.52 → 4697.56] I mean, it's nice.
[4697.92 → 4698.54] So there you go.
[4698.82 → 4699.76] That's what it looks like.
[4699.76 → 4701.44] I've got a brand case on here.
[4701.62 → 4704.30] And it actually does fit, even with the vinyl case.
[4704.34 → 4707.20] Although, I'm sure they'd probably prefer if you...
[4707.20 → 4708.86] If you kind of kept it clean...
[4708.86 → 4710.48] Clean metal on the back for the looks.
[4710.84 → 4714.02] So I told them I would install it on the phone and I would show it on the show.
[4714.44 → 4715.72] But that I wasn't going to review it.
[4715.72 → 4719.14] Because if I was going to review it, then I would have to bring up that you're spending
[4719.14 → 4723.46] a hundred and sixty dollars for a bumper case that effectively doesn't actually provide
[4723.46 → 4724.64] a ton of protection for your phone.
[4724.76 → 4725.68] It's a hundred and thirty-eight euros.
[4725.68 → 4726.60] Yeah, a hundred and thirty-eight euros.
[4726.80 → 4729.20] With that said, the protection for the phone isn't that bad.
[4729.26 → 4731.44] Because what they've done is they've got a bit of a lip on it here.
[4731.74 → 4734.56] So this lens is never going to sit face down on things anymore.
[4734.70 → 4734.86] Yeah.
[4734.92 → 4737.06] Which is a problem that I have with the iPhone 6.
[4737.06 → 4741.28] And then if you have a vinyl wrap back here, and you throw some phantom glass on the front,
[4741.70 → 4746.82] then aside from that you've just spent like two hundred dollars, the phone is actually
[4746.82 → 4748.18] reasonably well protected.
[4748.80 → 4750.86] And let's just go ahead and remove that.
[4751.06 → 4756.22] The phone will then be reasonably well protected, but you've just spent like two hundred dollars
[4756.22 → 4761.82] on like a combo case for your phone with the brand skin, phantom glass front, and like
[4761.82 → 4762.06] a...
[4762.70 → 4763.92] Buy a whole nother phone.
[4764.12 → 4765.90] We're going to get into the motherboards' territory there.
[4765.90 → 4769.68] And you're just like protecting your phone when you could just buy another one at that
[4769.68 → 4769.92] point.
[4770.12 → 4770.40] Yeah.
[4770.74 → 4771.68] Not quite, but...
[4771.68 → 4773.04] I mean, the button walk-throughs are good.
[4773.40 → 4777.62] And this is one of the few cases I've encountered that actually allows you to use the mute toggle
[4777.62 → 4781.52] as a pass-through rather than just kind of reaching through something.
[4781.98 → 4782.78] So I'll give them that.
[4782.88 → 4788.16] Like, it's nice, but I don't think that's the kind of thing that I would spend my own
[4788.16 → 4788.52] money on.
[4788.72 → 4788.98] Right.
[4789.32 → 4789.62] Yes.
[4789.98 → 4790.90] So there you go.
[4790.90 → 4795.76] I think that's pretty much it for everything that I wanted to talk about on the show today.
[4795.76 → 4800.40] I just wanted to do like a quick glance through to see if there was anything else, but I think
[4800.40 → 4801.10] that was it.
[4801.16 → 4803.10] There's that lamp that lasts for 40 years.
[4803.66 → 4804.76] Yeah, but it costs how much?
[4804.96 → 4805.54] Two grand.
[4805.74 → 4806.20] Two grand.
[4806.46 → 4806.76] Okay.
[4807.00 → 4809.56] I'd rather replace my light bulb every once in a while.
[4809.86 → 4810.24] Yeah.
[4810.24 → 4816.34] Especially because we've already got LED bulbs that cost like 10 bucks or 20 bucks and last
[4816.34 → 4818.06] for also lots of years.
[4818.80 → 4820.04] Maybe not 40 years.
[4820.18 → 4824.20] And like by the time that LED light bulb finally dies, there like might be something new and
[4824.20 → 4824.42] better.
[4824.74 → 4825.36] And also cheap.
[4825.38 → 4827.18] Or an improved version of that, which will also be cheap.
[4827.44 → 4827.66] Yeah.
[4827.78 → 4831.38] So here, guys, I'll pull up the article for that just for amusement more than anything
[4831.38 → 4831.68] else.
[4832.16 → 4835.54] So Jake Dyson has designed an LED light that lasts for 40 years.
[4835.54 → 4837.96] The light is called Ariel.
[4841.84 → 4843.16] The light is called Ariel.
[4843.52 → 4844.04] Scroll.
[4844.44 → 4844.88] Done.
[4845.42 → 4847.72] I was hoping to have something else to say about it.
[4847.88 → 4849.78] It has a massive freaking heat sink.
[4850.16 → 4850.36] Yep.
[4850.62 → 4852.40] But that's common with LED light bulbs.
[4852.58 → 4853.94] Like I installed LED lighting.
[4854.04 → 4854.26] Not that big.
[4854.74 → 4855.32] In, okay.
[4855.70 → 4860.22] I installed LED lights in my son's room, and they should have probably had bigger heat
[4860.22 → 4862.90] sinks because those things ran freaking hot.
[4862.96 → 4863.08] Yeah.
[4863.08 → 4869.20] So aside from needing to redo the dimmer switch to one that's LED, dimmable LED compatible,
[4869.68 → 4871.24] I put two of them in a fixture.
[4871.62 → 4874.52] Those things give off a ton of heat.
[4874.62 → 4875.80] Like it's actually kind of scary.
[4876.00 → 4876.28] Right.
[4876.38 → 4876.52] Yeah.
[4877.60 → 4878.04] Right.
[4878.24 → 4882.76] And then one other thing that I wanted to do was a call-out for someone who's been helping
[4882.76 → 4885.22] us out a lot on the WAN show lately.
[4886.32 → 4894.34] Both Ghost and Fighter Laid, who has been doing the timestamps on the WAN show pretty much alone,
[4894.48 → 4898.50] according to Ghost, who coordinates Fighter Laid doing the timestamps and submits them
[4898.50 → 4904.16] to me so that Luke and I don't have to sit and watch the show and kind of go through that
[4904.16 → 4904.82] on our own.
[4904.82 → 4909.30] Watch the show that we just hosted, which is kind of sucky.
[4911.62 → 4915.70] Hearing yourself talk for an hour and a half is like not great.
[4915.94 → 4917.80] So we crushed it, you guys.
[4917.90 → 4921.96] We had 8,600 viewers, which we've never had on the show before.
[4922.42 → 4923.66] You guys are amazing.
[4923.90 → 4926.94] Thank you so much for tuning in, and we'll see you guys again next week.
[4926.94 → 4928.98] I think we're going to do a very short after party tonight.
[4929.34 → 4929.46] Yeah.
[4929.54 → 4931.10] But other than that, it's packing time.
[4931.16 → 4931.92] We're heading to CES.
[4932.20 → 4932.52] Yes.
[4934.08 → 4935.22] Totally unprepared.
[4935.42 → 4935.88] Although I did.
[4935.88 → 4936.58] I need to shop tomorrow.
[4936.72 → 4937.32] I already did.
[4937.40 → 4938.06] I need shirts.
[4938.66 → 4939.54] I got some.
[4939.92 → 4940.24] Yeah.
[4940.50 → 4941.38] I don't have enough pants.
[4941.64 → 4943.74] I don't want to know about your sexual exploits.
[4945.48 → 4947.66] Oh, I see how you did that.
[4947.70 → 4950.48] Although if the shirts helped, then maybe you should tell me what shirts you were getting.
[4950.48 → 4952.22] The shirts did not help, actually.
[4952.34 → 4953.70] I didn't wear any of them for that.
[4954.58 → 4956.24] Well, you're not supposed to wear a shirt during that.
[4956.24 → 4958.68] I mean, how else are you supposed to show off your sexy six-pack?
[4958.70 → 4963.08] You would potentially wear a shirt in program before beginning.
[4963.20 → 4965.78] When you're still working on the objective.
[4966.00 → 4966.14] Yeah.
[4966.88 → 4967.88] And that's when you're shopping.
[4971.90 → 4973.26] Your shirts never help me.
[4975.10 → 4976.10] Just when they're off.
[4976.54 → 4976.76] Yeah.
[4977.24 → 4978.56] Did lyndon.com teach you that?
[4979.12 → 4979.52] No.
[4980.94 → 4982.86] But I could put that on a Squarespace site.
[4984.30 → 4986.02] And then you could look at it on your phone.
[4986.02 → 4987.42] And protect your phone with glass.
[4987.42 → 4987.44] I could put that on your phone with glass.
