[0.00 → 2.66] Is the camera supposed to be that zoomed out?
[3.16 → 4.66] So stay here and wait.
[4.76 → 6.16] And yeah, is the camera supposed to be that zoomed out?
[6.50 → 8.20] We seem super far away.
[8.66 → 9.66] Welcome to the bro show.
[9.88 → 10.50] The bro show.
[10.82 → 11.10] Yeah.
[11.50 → 13.80] So hopefully the audio is not terrible.
[14.06 → 14.62] I'm going to wait.
[15.44 → 16.72] Hopefully someone will tell me if it's horrible.
[17.34 → 20.38] One of the cool things that you might have seen or might not have seen is that I'm mobile.
[21.16 → 22.60] I can just like to go around.
[23.32 → 26.64] We have chairs that have roll things, which basically makes this work.
[26.82 → 27.58] It's perfect.
[27.96 → 29.20] I love you guys.
[29.20 → 30.38] Welcome to the intro.
[31.08 → 32.34] It's not working.
[33.38 → 34.36] All right.
[34.98 → 35.38] Intro.
[35.90 → 36.58] Intro.
[37.40 → 37.84] Intro.
[39.48 → 40.16] Intro.
[40.62 → 41.00] Yes.
[43.14 → 44.68] Audio is out of sync.
[45.44 → 46.10] Awesome.
[46.96 → 47.40] That's good.
[47.66 → 47.90] All right.
[47.90 → 48.68] Thank you.
[59.20 → 59.58] Linda.
[59.58 → 59.82] Linda.
[59.82 → 60.50] Linda.
[60.50 → 61.58] Linda.
[61.58 → 62.08] Linda.
[62.08 → 64.78] Learn all the things.
[64.88 → 65.64] Learn all the stuff.
[65.72 → 66.58] It's Squarespace.com.
[67.42 → 70.02] Make all the things about the websites and stuff.
[70.92 → 72.38] Actually, Linda.com is great.
[72.46 → 73.62] You can learn a bunch of different stuff.
[73.94 → 75.12] And Squarespace.com is great.
[75.20 → 78.10] You can make a bunch of different websites using their template-y things.
[78.10 → 80.14] Coming back here now.
[80.74 → 83.06] I can even tell the audio is out of sync here.
[83.48 → 83.76] Wow.
[84.28 → 87.82] Just say what you were going to say and then mouth it afterwards.
[88.20 → 88.78] So, hey!
[89.62 → 90.02] Hey!
[90.12 → 91.12] This is a good show!
[91.12 → 91.18] Oh!
[91.18 → 91.68] Oh!
[94.68 → 95.20] Oh, man.
[95.86 → 96.12] Oh, man.
[96.12 → 96.58] Oh, man.
[97.78 → 98.14] Oh!
[98.70 → 100.40] So, the video is out of sync still?
[101.00 → 101.84] I don't know, dude.
[101.96 → 102.18] Should I...
[102.18 → 102.88] Turn up the volume?
[102.98 → 103.80] I can do that.
[104.88 → 106.90] The video is delayed here.
[109.34 → 112.52] So, I think it's the capture card or something.
[113.16 → 113.50] Oh!
[113.66 → 114.26] I don't know.
[114.84 → 115.54] That's good idea.
[115.78 → 117.08] Super out of sync!
[118.04 → 119.76] I'm just hanging out while everyone freaks out.
[119.76 → 121.44] I want to run away!
[122.52 → 123.00] Okay.
[123.18 → 125.44] So, I don't know...
[125.44 → 126.12] Why is there...
[126.12 → 127.50] There's no delay set up on anything.
[129.48 → 130.72] So, that's not good.
[132.10 → 133.40] Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[134.22 → 135.44] That's probably a good idea.
[136.06 → 137.42] Did all the camera people just leave?
[137.56 → 138.02] They did.
[138.18 → 139.20] When we're having camera problems?
[139.34 → 139.58] Yep.
[140.90 → 142.26] That's what camera people do.
[143.54 → 145.50] They just leave you when you need them.
[146.30 → 147.60] Yeah, I just can't trust them.
[148.30 → 148.74] Okay.
[148.98 → 149.46] Well...
[149.46 → 151.96] I don't know.
[152.48 → 153.38] Turn V-Sync on?
[153.60 → 153.90] Ugh!
[154.96 → 155.60] I wish.
[155.60 → 155.96] It's always a problem.
[156.32 → 156.84] I wish.
[157.62 → 158.62] Wouldn't that be great?
[160.94 → 162.34] Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[162.46 → 163.58] Delay the audio track.
[164.02 → 164.46] That's...
[164.46 → 165.62] Not a bad idea.
[165.88 → 167.78] But I don't know how delayed the video track is.
[169.18 → 170.24] Want to make a guess?
[171.00 → 171.38] Three.
[171.84 → 172.46] Three milliseconds.
[172.70 → 173.72] That's really fast.
[173.84 → 174.96] Maybe more milliseconds.
[176.14 → 176.54] 30.
[176.54 → 177.26] 30 milliseconds?
[177.40 → 177.66] Okay.
[178.96 → 179.92] Seems like a lot.
[182.72 → 183.04] Okay.
[183.38 → 184.42] Let's try 20.
[184.56 → 185.54] That's the wrong keyboard.
[185.82 → 186.62] Let's try 20.
[189.04 → 189.44] 20.
[189.44 → 191.62] Okay.
[191.62 → 191.76] Okay.
[194.06 → 196.08] Wasn't the audio already delayed though?
[196.14 → 197.60] So delaying it, wouldn't that increase the issue?
[197.88 → 198.62] Or are we...
[198.62 → 201.54] No, I think the video is delayed.
[201.94 → 203.16] I think the audio is on time.
[203.26 → 204.18] I think the video is delayed.
[204.36 → 206.22] So if we delay the audio, then they should mesh up.
[206.30 → 206.54] Gotcha.
[206.54 → 206.62] Okay.
[207.14 → 208.58] How's it working, guys?
[211.40 → 212.68] Did that not work at all?
[213.36 → 213.80] 300.
[214.46 → 214.82] Wow.
[217.40 → 218.42] Audio delay.
[219.64 → 220.12] 300.
[222.34 → 224.64] That seems huge, but we're now trying 300.
[224.98 → 225.84] Where's Justin?
[225.84 → 226.02] Justin?
[226.02 → 231.50] Isn't Justin our official stream watcher?
[231.78 → 233.10] Talk to me about the things.
[234.80 → 235.20] Okay.
[236.06 → 237.70] So I think maybe...
[239.16 → 242.86] I just tried 300.
[243.12 → 244.32] I don't really work in milliseconds.
[244.96 → 247.20] Some people are saying a little bit more, so maybe I'll try 400.
[247.36 → 247.96] 400, yeah.
[248.06 → 248.80] 400, okay.
[249.44 → 251.44] Thanks for working with me on this Twitch chat.
[251.44 → 254.02] We're basically diagnosing everything together.
[254.02 → 258.52] So instead of watching Tech Tips, what you guys can actually do is just tune into the
[258.52 → 264.18] WAN show, and then you can learn your own Tech Tips from helping us fix things.
[264.38 → 267.16] We're crowdsourcing the fixes.
[267.42 → 270.44] This is Kickstarter, but live, and you don't have to donate.
[270.68 → 271.06] Exactly.
[271.96 → 272.74] It's just your time.
[273.12 → 274.40] Crowdsourced Tech Tips.
[274.80 → 276.20] So we just went to 400.
[277.32 → 279.94] So let me know what you guys think of that.
[280.80 → 282.76] Justin, I would like some input from you as well.
[282.76 → 289.64] We need help from internal sources and external sources to optimize the throughput of our
[289.64 → 290.28] audio and video.
[291.16 → 291.56] 500?
[292.02 → 292.28] Okay.
[296.76 → 297.16] 500.
[297.90 → 298.34] 500.
[298.56 → 299.72] We've got 500 here.
[299.84 → 300.62] We're going to try 500.
[300.86 → 302.56] People are saying 420 by Linus.
[302.68 → 303.70] 420 YOLO, 360.
[303.84 → 306.28] I was going to say if Linus was here, he'd put it at 420.
[306.48 → 307.32] That's something he would do.
[307.74 → 308.44] I'd put it at 500.
[308.44 → 309.06] We're not Linus.
[309.30 → 309.58] Nope.
[309.58 → 309.64] Nope.
[309.64 → 309.66] Nope.
[309.66 → 309.70] Nope.
[312.76 → 314.90] Some guy said 9,000.
[314.98 → 315.90] That would probably work.
[316.56 → 318.28] Over 9,000 would probably work.
[318.42 → 320.32] 9,000 is kind of...
[320.32 → 320.56] Eh.
[321.04 → 322.36] You're trying, but you're not fully there.
[322.68 → 322.92] Yeah.
[323.38 → 324.86] If I had, like...
[324.86 → 327.80] I was going to say a super nice car, I would price it at $9,001.
[328.10 → 329.56] Then I was like, that's not a super nice car.
[329.62 → 330.12] That's dope.
[330.28 → 332.34] Your car's, like, double that.
[333.24 → 333.42] Yeah.
[334.58 → 335.66] 500 to 600.
[335.66 → 336.74] Oh, Lord.
[336.74 → 336.80] Oh, Lord.
[336.80 → 337.50] It's just awesome.
[337.60 → 337.92] Okay.
[338.32 → 338.68] Okay.
[338.78 → 341.00] We're going to change it to 600.
[342.18 → 343.40] We're just going to keep jumping at hundreds.
[343.56 → 344.96] And then we can dial it back a little bit.
[345.18 → 345.98] We're getting there, boys.
[346.14 → 346.90] We're now at 600.
[347.16 → 348.64] Thank you guys for sticking with us.
[349.16 → 350.72] This has been fun.
[351.12 → 352.04] This has been good.
[352.30 → 353.18] It's been an experience.
[353.44 → 357.40] The cool part was that when I had to do the sponsor spots, the image was up.
[357.98 → 359.58] So it doesn't even matter if the audio was deleted.
[359.94 → 361.78] As I was saying, we could just do the whole thing like this.
[361.78 → 364.90] And then we're flawless because...
[364.90 → 367.12] Except if I, like, laugh and do that.
[367.34 → 367.80] That's true.
[367.92 → 368.26] And you'd know.
[368.44 → 369.76] It's fun watching a delay.
[370.48 → 371.64] It is fun watching the delay.
[371.72 → 373.20] I did that while we were spinning in our chairs.
[373.22 → 373.82] You guys can't see that.
[373.84 → 374.10] I'm sorry.
[374.28 → 375.22] It's pretty fun.
[375.26 → 375.88] It's too much.
[376.06 → 376.54] Pull it back.
[376.98 → 377.64] Is that right, Justin?
[377.70 → 378.10] Too much?
[381.64 → 383.62] We're going to wait for some input from Justin.
[383.62 → 388.12] But I'm thinking 580 might be where we need to go.
[389.22 → 390.04] Way too much.
[390.22 → 391.00] Less than 500.
[392.78 → 393.46] 5.50.
[393.68 → 394.50] 5.50?
[394.60 → 394.72] All right.
[394.84 → 396.00] You're slightly ahead.
[396.66 → 397.20] 5.50.
[397.32 → 398.28] I'm not going to go ahead.
[398.66 → 399.14] Okay.
[399.38 → 400.32] We're going to narrow it in.
[400.40 → 400.82] All right.
[401.02 → 401.78] We will get there.
[401.90 → 402.22] Cool.
[402.70 → 403.32] By 6.
[403.60 → 404.90] By 6 o'clock.
[405.22 → 405.52] Yeah.
[405.92 → 408.24] We're only half an hour late because of misplaced equipment.
[408.46 → 412.28] And then we're going to be an hour late after that because of equipment not working well.
[413.24 → 414.58] So there we go.
[415.86 → 417.36] I want to run away.
[417.36 → 417.68] Yay.
[418.34 → 420.14] So topics that we have.
[421.14 → 423.58] Netflix is going to be dropping thousands of titles.
[424.52 → 425.72] Unified Weapons Master.
[425.90 → 428.12] They're going to have a high-tech gladiatorial combat.
[428.32 → 430.08] You can't really see what I'm saying right now.
[430.08 → 432.54] I feel like that dude from Tool Time.
[432.90 → 433.28] Yes.
[433.50 → 433.70] Yes.
[433.70 → 434.48] Who's standing behind the fence.
[434.48 → 435.22] He peeks over the fence.
[436.14 → 437.48] I think you actually have to go higher.
[438.92 → 439.48] 75?
[440.08 → 440.20] Yeah.
[440.20 → 440.56] I screwed up.
[440.64 → 443.20] When I was listening to it, it was when you were getting it.
[443.20 → 444.48] So over?
[444.68 → 446.24] Try 650, 750.
[446.86 → 448.98] That's a lot of delay.
[449.12 → 450.24] That's a lot of those milliseconds.
[451.68 → 451.96] Yeah.
[452.32 → 452.56] Okay.
[452.56 → 453.68] We were pretty off when you first started.
[453.68 → 453.88] Okay.
[453.98 → 454.74] Go check it again.
[455.62 → 460.16] We also have the introduction of GDDR5X.
[461.36 → 464.18] Apparently, GDDR5X WAN.
[464.86 → 467.48] Although, I'm pretty sure that was just me typing that in properly.
[468.26 → 471.60] Then after that, we have new federal requirements on cell phone surveillance.
[472.12 → 472.94] So that should be pretty cool.
[473.20 → 477.04] I have to be very animated with my eyes because you can't see my mouth.
[477.48 → 477.84] No.
[478.38 → 478.74] Okay.
[479.12 → 483.18] Moving forward, I need to move down to one of my topics.
[483.42 → 484.38] So give me a second here.
[484.82 → 487.52] I just need to keep talking like this because then you can't really feel the delay.
[487.68 → 489.22] Actually, I should show Justin the delay.
[489.76 → 491.78] That would probably help him try to figure that out.
[492.20 → 494.04] So I'm actually going to go through my first topic.
[494.16 → 497.66] We're just going to try to live troubleshoot this with Justin in the other room while we go.
[498.42 → 500.98] So yes, Netflix is dropping thousands of titles.
[500.98 → 504.02] Apparently, they're not renewing their deal with distributor Epic.
[504.22 → 509.36] So basically, how Netflix gets all their titles is they have to have a deal with the distributor of these videos
[509.36 → 514.78] who would also distribute them to different cable companies and whatnot so that you could do video on demand.
[514.78 → 519.44] Netflix's deal with Epic was reportedly worth about a billion dollars.
[519.56 → 520.18] That's pretty good scene.
[522.58 → 524.60] It was reportedly worth about a billion dollars.
[525.08 → 527.38] It will run until the end of September 2015.
[527.38 → 532.66] So yeah, you don't have much time at all if you want to watch some of these movies and stuff.
[533.14 → 537.88] Chief Content Officer Ted Saran dos, hopefully I'm saying that correctly, said,
[538.00 → 543.22] while many of these movies are popular, they're also widely available on cable and other subscription platforms
[543.22 → 548.28] at the same time they are as Netflix and subject to the same drawn-out licensing periods.
[549.38 → 550.28] Ad 300?
[550.28 → 554.38] Ad 300?
[557.02 → 558.44] It's like a 50% increase.
[559.52 → 559.96] 650.
[561.36 → 565.10] So as we're talking about Netflix, they're trying to move to more of their own original content,
[565.32 → 569.20] which is kind of super hard to blame them because the original content is doing extremely well.
[569.22 → 570.00] Really, really well.
[570.26 → 571.26] I loved House of Cards.
[571.36 → 572.38] House of Cards was awesome.
[572.56 → 573.66] Daredevil was really cool.
[573.76 → 574.48] Have you watched Daredevil?
[574.66 → 575.64] I haven't watched the entirety.
[575.78 → 576.66] I think I've watched about three quarters.
[576.66 → 577.30] Yeah, yeah.
[577.42 → 582.50] There's a few, like I felt there were a couple actors in Daredevil which weren't like super amazing,
[582.70 → 584.70] but the show overall was actually perfect.
[584.92 → 585.00] Yeah.
[585.14 → 590.68] But yeah, they're going to be moving towards a more their content-focused platform,
[590.68 → 596.54] which isn't the reason why I got Netflix, but might make me keep Netflix.
[597.28 → 598.04] So I don't know.
[598.30 → 603.12] I know very little about Hulu, but Hulu is picking up the deal that Netflix is going to be leaving behind.
[603.12 → 603.44] Yeah.
[603.52 → 606.46] So they're trying to kind of push their way into that void.
[606.52 → 609.68] If you're saying the reason why you got Netflix, maybe that'll pull more people towards Hulu.
[610.06 → 612.58] I know Hulu is not quite as successful as Netflix.
[615.14 → 619.04] But yeah, they're going to be picking up all those shows that you're going to be losing from Netflix.
[619.14 → 622.44] So if you really want those shows, if that's a problem for you, Hulu could be an answer.
[623.28 → 628.40] Haven't heard too many great things about Hulu, to be completely honest, but Netflix is definitely the cat of kingpins.
[628.70 → 631.56] But again, they have so many of their own original shows, and they're going to keep it rolling.
[631.56 → 634.86] Orange is the New Black wasn't a good show for me, but it was extremely highly rated.
[635.78 → 637.14] People really liked that show.
[637.24 → 638.08] I liked season one.
[638.58 → 640.76] I wasn't super into the season two or three.
[641.02 → 643.38] Season two, I was like, all right, they're bridging into something.
[643.48 → 643.96] All right, cool.
[644.04 → 645.22] And then season three, I was like, meh.
[645.74 → 646.40] Yeah, I don't know.
[646.56 → 647.64] Season one, that was pretty cool.
[647.80 → 648.46] House of Cards did a similar thing.
[648.90 → 649.42] Yeah, that's true.
[649.68 → 652.74] Season one and two were just gang busters and three kind of fell off a little.
[653.06 → 655.98] But anyway, that's Netflix for you.
[655.98 → 661.32] I kind of expect if they keep doing this, there's going to be more rampant piracy again.
[662.12 → 666.66] Because for a long time there, it was like, how is everyone watching whatever show downloaded
[666.66 → 667.48] on Pirate Bay?
[667.64 → 672.76] And now it's kind of the same deal, obviously, but also with a huge amount of it gone to Netflix.
[673.46 → 675.72] And I think, yeah, I think that might stop.
[675.88 → 680.58] Because yes, Netflix is doing a huge amount of original series, but the people that just
[680.58 → 684.54] kind of watch Netflix all the time are going to run out of original series stuff really fast.
[684.54 → 688.24] And they're probably hanging around for that mass experience of other stuff.
[689.20 → 690.30] Apparently, so it's the 1200.
[690.96 → 691.68] It's the chat site.
[692.22 → 692.50] Okay.
[692.56 → 693.14] But it's the 1200.
[693.30 → 693.54] Okay.
[694.72 → 695.82] It could be like time.
[696.06 → 696.24] Then.
[699.24 → 700.96] Also, did you hear anything about that action?
[701.14 → 701.70] No.
[705.78 → 706.80] It's a game, right?
[707.56 → 708.12] Okay, yeah.
[709.08 → 709.26] Yeah.
[709.26 → 709.90] Okay.
[710.42 → 711.26] Hacks was awesome.
[711.48 → 714.40] So chat, chat, if it's wrong, it's at 1200 now.
[714.68 → 716.00] So you guys might sign.
[716.78 → 718.14] It is at 1200 now.
[718.34 → 718.54] Yeah.
[718.66 → 719.66] So we'll see how that works.
[719.74 → 720.30] Sorry, guys.
[720.32 → 722.02] The cancer was spreading through chat.
[722.10 → 722.82] 1200, 1200.
[722.82 → 723.26] Yes.
[723.42 → 725.04] Well, we'll see if they're right.
[725.14 → 726.72] Someone might have been trying to time it or something.
[726.82 → 727.80] I can clap for everybody.
[730.88 → 731.68] There's your clap.
[732.04 → 734.62] I tried to like line it up so you could see my hands well and stuff.
[735.34 → 738.32] Anyway, we will keep moving on.
[739.46 → 741.24] We'll try to do all the main topics.
[741.24 → 744.70] So Unified Weapons Masters High Tech Gladiatorial Combat.
[745.50 → 745.62] Yeah.
[745.68 → 750.08] So this is pretty much probably as sick as it sounds, if I can find the topic.
[750.58 → 752.06] Control F, glad.
[752.52 → 753.86] Third page, top of the third.
[754.04 → 754.62] Found it.
[755.16 → 756.30] Control F is my hero.
[756.30 → 757.40] Looks really cool.
[757.48 → 762.20] The suits are designed really well, I guess you could say from the video I watched.
[762.26 → 764.04] They look great fighting.
[764.14 → 767.88] And basically what the idea is, you can do melee combat with different types of weapons.
[768.00 → 769.08] The suits will protect you.
[769.26 → 773.00] And the biggest part of the suits is actually they give you a reading of what the blow would be.
[773.44 → 774.92] And basically gives you health points.
[775.06 → 778.94] And you would lose health points by taking strikes in different areas.
[779.08 → 783.58] But there are such things as, you know, a one-hit kill, like something to the throat or something like that.
[783.58 → 787.90] But maybe if you just kick the guy in the side, he'll take a, you know, X amount of damage.
[788.60 → 794.78] It looks fascinating, kind of combining the oldest form of fighting with the newest technology.
[795.14 → 796.76] A fascinating blend they've got going.
[796.76 → 797.88] It's actually pretty freaking cool.
[797.96 → 801.50] What I liked at the beginning of this video was just them showing, what's up?
[803.24 → 803.60] Down?
[803.60 → 809.02] I thought it was at 2K.
[810.62 → 812.40] We did 1,200, I thought.
[812.64 → 813.12] 1,200.
[813.46 → 814.72] Yeah, 1,700?
[815.36 → 817.98] That's a lot of milliseconds.
[817.98 → 820.74] Your five was off by the reason.
[821.34 → 821.74] Okay.
[822.70 → 823.30] All right.
[824.74 → 827.88] Anyway, you guys just saw that again, probably, hopefully.
[828.26 → 830.88] So what's really cool is they're fighting.
[831.08 → 834.26] Those are probably foam, because that makes sense.
[834.38 → 835.28] But they're fighting.
[835.66 → 837.20] And you can just record the data afterwards.
[837.20 → 840.42] If you have someone sitting on the sidelines, I'm sure they could tell you when things happen.
[840.52 → 843.28] So if you get a throat shot like you were talking about, he could end the match.
[843.32 → 844.30] He could do whatever you want.
[845.52 → 846.24] Really cool.
[846.24 → 849.92] Apparently, when are they starting their first actual matches?
[850.70 → 852.34] I think they were trying for the end.
[852.46 → 853.66] I tried to find the doc here.
[853.70 → 856.40] I think they were trying for the end of this year, probably beginning of next year.
[856.72 → 857.32] I think is what they're saying.
[857.34 → 859.32] First live combat event in 2016.
[859.76 → 860.42] Okay, there you go.
[860.52 → 860.78] It's going to be a doc.
[860.86 → 861.80] So that's pretty cool.
[861.88 → 862.92] That'll be exciting to watch.
[863.38 → 864.26] I kind of hope.
[865.48 → 866.10] I don't know.
[866.26 → 868.94] They're probably foam weapons, but I kind of hope that they don't.
[869.12 → 870.94] They said that they're going to be real weapons.
[871.18 → 872.66] The suits are made to protect you.
[873.20 → 875.24] And you can see at one point, if you watch the whole video,
[875.24 → 877.22] the guy is completely losing.
[877.44 → 878.08] He's losing.
[878.12 → 878.90] His health points are going down.
[878.96 → 879.68] I think he's got 30%.
[879.68 → 880.54] The other guys at 100.
[880.90 → 881.86] 30% guy wins.
[881.92 → 884.08] He gets a strike through to the throat, and they pause it,
[884.14 → 887.30] and you can see the sword hit and bend and flex with the pressure.
[887.66 → 888.78] It might not be foam.
[889.16 → 890.98] It might not be steel, but it could be something.
[891.26 → 892.62] Well, it could be that fencing.
[892.62 → 895.20] Yeah, it could just be really thin kind of.
[895.46 → 895.58] Yeah.
[895.96 → 898.78] But I think their goal is to really, really get physical with it.
[898.80 → 903.64] You see guys hitting pretty hard, and the armour is supposed to protect you kind of deal.
[903.78 → 905.12] So fascinating stuff.
[905.36 → 907.78] I know they've been trying to work on this for a while,
[907.82 → 908.54] and it could be a lot of fun.
[908.62 → 910.70] I think the big thing right out of the gate would be the price.
[911.02 → 914.14] I think it'd be extremely limited just due to the insane cost.
[914.32 → 916.08] Well, if they're doing a live combat event,
[916.08 → 920.20] it sounds kind of like they're probably going to plan it more around UFC-style stuff.
[920.36 → 920.60] Oh, yeah.
[920.62 → 923.52] So not like laser tag at your local thing,
[923.76 → 927.96] but more like no-named fighters going into gladiatorial-style combat.
[928.12 → 929.20] So yeah, it'll probably be expensive,
[929.40 → 933.04] but I'm sure they'll probably be the only ones actually using the full-body suits.
[933.40 → 935.88] Apparently they use a combination of, I'm going to say this wrong,
[935.96 → 939.60] but a combination of piezoelectric shock and vibration sensors
[939.60 → 943.92] and accelerometers to measure not only where the hit lands,
[944.04 → 945.24] but the severity as well.
[945.24 → 949.12] So if I strike and I just kind of nick his arm barely,
[949.34 → 951.88] that's probably not going to take off that many hit points.
[952.12 → 954.32] But if I strike, and I hit the same part,
[954.42 → 956.44] but then kind of dig in when I do so,
[956.48 → 958.72] it might do a lot more in terms of damage.
[958.82 → 959.54] I'm not entirely sure.
[959.68 → 960.84] And these guys throw everything.
[960.98 → 962.56] They're throwing elbows and kicks,
[962.90 → 964.34] and they're tripping each other.
[964.70 → 968.36] And yeah, that's super cool.
[968.48 → 971.28] Apparently the data collected by the suit will be beamed wirelessly
[971.28 → 974.54] to a special ringside computer system like I was mentioning earlier,
[974.54 → 975.74] which will keep the score.
[975.86 → 978.74] So that's essentially probably going to be health points.
[978.92 → 979.20] Oh, yeah.
[979.68 → 980.82] They show the little bars.
[980.92 → 983.38] It's very video game-issue in that video.
[983.50 → 984.04] Check that out.
[984.22 → 984.82] Jump back.
[985.22 → 988.98] So I linked in the chat the video so that you can watch,
[989.38 → 991.16] but I'm going to jump back here right now
[991.16 → 992.88] so you can actually see the health on the bottom.
[992.88 → 994.84] So that guy just hit 0% and lost.
[996.28 → 998.60] I'll jump back a little bit more so you can see that again.
[999.12 → 1001.34] At a different point, they also say what these guys are trained in.
[1001.34 → 1003.52] These guys, some of them are ninjutsu.
[1003.62 → 1004.66] Some guys are doing karate,
[1004.78 → 1007.10] but all sorts of different martial art backgrounds for these guys.
[1008.96 → 1010.08] But yeah, it looks pretty cool.
[1010.14 → 1011.50] They have some really great engagements.
[1012.18 → 1012.40] Yeah.
[1013.40 → 1014.90] It's got the ninja Bradley.
[1015.34 → 1017.02] See, nice kick there right to the midsection.
[1017.12 → 1017.88] It actually did a good amount of damage.
[1017.88 → 1018.38] That's interesting.
[1018.52 → 1019.84] So you can see their BPM.
[1020.68 → 1023.04] You can see what KGF.
[1023.10 → 1024.28] I'm not entirely sure what that is,
[1024.44 → 1027.84] but probably like armour or health or something.
[1027.96 → 1028.40] I'm not sure.
[1028.62 → 1030.66] But it's cool how much data they have on these guys.
[1030.92 → 1031.14] Yeah.
[1031.28 → 1031.46] Pretty sick.
[1031.94 → 1032.62] What's up, Justin?
[1033.76 → 1034.62] It's still up.
[1034.72 → 1035.50] Are you hitting apply?
[1035.90 → 1036.22] I am.
[1036.76 → 1037.16] Yes.
[1038.00 → 1039.18] He's definitely hitting apply.
[1039.30 → 1040.20] I can vouch for it.
[1040.32 → 1040.48] Yeah.
[1040.66 → 1042.40] I was worried about that, actually.
[1042.52 → 1043.56] I am hitting apply.
[1044.16 → 1045.12] It's on 1700.
[1045.68 → 1046.44] Definitely applied.
[1046.44 → 1048.44] But I'm trying to...
[1049.96 → 1050.44] 2K.
[1051.66 → 1052.98] It's still up, but at this point,
[1053.06 → 1054.78] I think I'm going crazy
[1054.78 → 1056.66] because I'm not even sure what we're doing
[1056.66 → 1057.92] is actually making a difference.
[1058.64 → 1059.26] Yeah, okay.
[1059.52 → 1060.66] It's now on 2K.
[1061.24 → 1061.64] 2K.
[1061.84 → 1062.96] Like 2K games.
[1063.22 → 1064.08] Did anyone get that reference?
[1064.12 → 1065.90] Can we sell it for another $50 now?
[1066.00 → 1066.30] Maybe.
[1066.54 → 1066.78] Probably.
[1067.00 → 1067.26] Maybe.
[1067.58 → 1068.46] I think they came out...
[1068.46 → 1069.32] I could be wrong with this,
[1069.36 → 1070.54] but they came out with an NBA game
[1070.54 → 1072.24] that was like $70 on Steam.
[1072.52 → 1072.78] Really?
[1072.90 → 1073.86] Yeah, 2K NBA.
[1074.04 → 1074.44] It was a 70.
[1074.44 → 1076.64] I'm excited to play Mad Max.
[1076.80 → 1078.58] Speaking of excited to play video games
[1078.58 → 1079.90] and possibly Mad Max,
[1080.16 → 1082.10] I'm going to do a shameless plug here
[1082.10 → 1082.88] because I think it's okay
[1082.88 → 1083.64] because it's for charity.
[1084.14 → 1085.48] Tomorrow, Saturday,
[1085.72 → 1087.22] not entirely sure when I'm going to start.
[1087.50 → 1089.12] Maybe before noon
[1089.12 → 1090.52] is the time I'm giving right now.
[1090.58 → 1091.02] I'm going to be starting
[1091.02 → 1092.34] a 24-hour charity stream
[1092.34 → 1093.16] for Extra Life.
[1093.60 → 1094.48] I've been tweeting that out
[1094.48 → 1095.68] a little bit over the last bit.
[1096.42 → 1097.50] So yeah, come by.
[1097.78 → 1098.22] Hang out.
[1098.52 → 1099.10] Maybe donate.
[1099.28 → 1099.90] Maybe don't.
[1100.06 → 1100.82] Just tell your friends.
[1100.92 → 1101.40] Do something.
[1101.40 → 1102.30] I'm going to be playing games
[1102.30 → 1103.20] for a super long time
[1103.20 → 1104.38] and hopefully we'll make money
[1104.38 → 1105.00] for Extra Life.
[1105.24 → 1107.02] I did a charity stream
[1107.02 → 1109.64] a bit over a year ago, I think,
[1109.80 → 1111.68] and my memory is failing me
[1111.68 → 1113.74] and my Twitter didn't go back far enough,
[1113.90 → 1115.58] but I think we made about $3,200.
[1116.26 → 1118.38] So the goal this year is $5,000,
[1118.54 → 1119.36] which is insane.
[1119.86 → 1120.80] We might not get it,
[1121.20 → 1123.16] but I think it would be pretty cool.
[1123.44 → 1125.00] It was extremely successful last time.
[1125.12 → 1125.58] It was.
[1125.78 → 1125.96] Yeah.
[1127.56 → 1127.88] $3,000.
[1127.88 → 1128.04] Okay.
[1128.76 → 1129.20] Holy.
[1131.20 → 1131.60] Okay.
[1132.56 → 1133.74] General settings, audio.
[1134.22 → 1135.50] Should we just set to like 10,000
[1135.50 → 1136.88] and see if it's actually making a difference?
[1137.96 → 1138.58] Like why?
[1139.48 → 1139.84] Okay.
[1140.40 → 1141.00] There we go.
[1141.64 → 1142.08] Yep.
[1143.04 → 1144.20] 3,000.
[1145.42 → 1146.18] It's okay.
[1146.60 → 1147.86] We'll see what happens.
[1148.58 → 1150.14] I guess we will see.
[1150.78 → 1151.02] Okay.
[1151.12 → 1152.02] Moving on.
[1152.14 → 1153.44] That was actually pretty freaking cool.
[1153.54 → 1153.90] Moving on.
[1153.90 → 1155.08] New federal requirements
[1155.08 → 1156.32] on cell phone surveillance.
[1156.32 → 1158.22] So federal law enforcement
[1158.22 → 1159.64] have routinely been required
[1159.64 → 1160.98] to obtain a search warrant
[1160.98 → 1162.10] before using secretive
[1162.10 → 1165.00] and intrusive cell phone tracking technologies.
[1166.40 → 1168.30] But, and something like the Stingray,
[1168.46 → 1169.88] which is a suitcase-sized device,
[1170.22 → 1172.00] sweeps up basic cell phone data
[1172.00 → 1172.64] from a neighbourhood,
[1172.90 → 1174.04] which can trick phones
[1174.04 → 1174.94] to connecting to it.
[1175.02 → 1175.54] So basically,
[1175.68 → 1176.78] even if you're not making calls
[1176.78 → 1177.90] or texting people or whatever,
[1178.04 → 1180.04] your phone is always connecting to things.
[1180.42 → 1181.16] So if the Stingray
[1181.16 → 1182.56] can make your phone connect to it,
[1182.62 → 1183.84] they can find your phone,
[1183.96 → 1185.48] which is probably in your pocket,
[1185.48 → 1186.60] so they can find you.
[1187.54 → 1189.84] Now, I didn't have a ton of time
[1189.84 → 1190.72] to actually read this
[1190.72 → 1192.30] because I was busy with all the things
[1192.30 → 1193.96] like finding capture cards.
[1194.82 → 1195.74] I have read stuff
[1195.74 → 1198.04] about the Stingray previously to today.
[1198.12 → 1199.24] They've been using a lot in the States
[1199.24 → 1201.20] with the whole different Ferguson issues.
[1201.30 → 1203.10] And there are a lot of things going on
[1203.10 → 1204.00] in the States
[1204.00 → 1206.08] with kind of police versus citizens.
[1206.08 → 1207.20] And there's a lot of tension there.
[1207.72 → 1208.42] And apparently,
[1208.50 → 1210.00] the Stingray has been used quite a bit
[1210.00 → 1211.66] in all sorts of places.
[1211.72 → 1212.94] They can rip your calls.
[1212.94 → 1214.38] They can take your texts,
[1214.46 → 1215.22] all this kind of things
[1215.22 → 1215.74] I've been reading
[1215.74 → 1217.30] from different news outlets.
[1217.40 → 1218.52] So there definitely needs to be something
[1218.52 → 1220.36] to manage this.
[1220.70 → 1220.80] Yeah.
[1220.90 → 1222.06] And I think this is at least
[1222.06 → 1223.10] a great first step
[1223.10 → 1224.30] because it does appear,
[1224.86 → 1226.16] especially on kind of
[1226.16 → 1227.46] some of the alternative news outlets
[1227.46 → 1228.06] that talk about
[1228.06 → 1228.84] these different protests,
[1228.94 → 1229.96] that they're using these things
[1229.96 → 1230.80] extremely widespread.
[1230.98 → 1231.98] There's no control over it.
[1232.44 → 1233.62] They're just popping them up
[1233.62 → 1235.02] whenever and however they wish to.
[1235.84 → 1235.94] Yeah.
[1236.02 → 1237.84] So any control would be fantastic
[1237.84 → 1239.76] as privacy is a bigger and bigger issue
[1239.76 → 1242.20] with our wireless tech these days.
[1242.32 → 1242.38] Yes.
[1242.38 → 1242.92] And basically,
[1243.10 → 1243.92] what's happening is
[1243.92 → 1245.34] the new policy requires a warrant
[1245.34 → 1246.26] in most cases
[1246.26 → 1247.64] except for immediate security.
[1247.94 → 1249.86] So immediate threats, sorry.
[1250.00 → 1250.56] So basically,
[1251.06 → 1252.18] immediate emergencies.
[1252.64 → 1253.56] I can talk.
[1253.82 → 1255.26] Like national security threats,
[1255.32 → 1256.14] although I don't think
[1256.14 → 1257.54] that's properly defined.
[1258.70 → 1259.60] Authorities will need
[1259.60 → 1260.32] to delete data
[1260.32 → 1261.12] that's been collected
[1261.12 → 1262.26] once they have the info
[1262.26 → 1263.00] that they need.
[1263.42 → 1264.98] And the American Civil Liberties Union
[1264.98 → 1265.90] has said that the policy
[1265.90 → 1267.14] is a good first step.
[1267.14 → 1268.92] called on the Justice Department
[1268.92 → 1270.96] to close remaining loopholes
[1270.96 → 1272.04] such as one allowing
[1272.04 → 1273.36] for warrantless surveillance
[1273.36 → 1275.28] under undefined
[1275.28 → 1276.70] exceptional circumstances.
[1277.14 → 1278.12] So it's kind of
[1278.12 → 1279.22] what I was mentioning earlier.
[1279.26 → 1280.04] Lose terminology.
[1280.22 → 1280.96] Yeah, yeah.
[1281.12 → 1282.24] Exceptional circumstances.
[1282.74 → 1283.80] What does that mean?
[1284.76 → 1285.38] To me, nothing.
[1285.94 → 1287.02] Not having jam
[1287.02 → 1287.88] to go on my peanut butter
[1287.88 → 1288.56] and jam sandwich
[1288.56 → 1289.42] can sometimes be
[1289.42 → 1290.52] an exceptional circumstance.
[1290.96 → 1292.24] I can be pretty distraught
[1292.24 → 1293.10] about that.
[1293.10 → 1293.16] It's true.
[1293.54 → 1294.42] Because just having
[1294.42 → 1295.06] the peanut butter
[1295.06 → 1296.34] makes it so that your mouth
[1296.34 → 1297.64] just gets all...
[1297.64 → 1298.18] Yep.
[1298.40 → 1298.94] You need the jam
[1298.94 → 1299.58] to smooth things out.
[1299.70 → 1300.10] Exactly.
[1300.26 → 1301.96] So that's not a good thing.
[1302.52 → 1304.54] And it might be helpful
[1304.54 → 1305.62] if I could use
[1305.62 → 1306.66] a surveillance device
[1306.66 → 1308.04] to find a store
[1308.04 → 1308.94] where I could buy the jam.
[1309.22 → 1309.46] Yeah.
[1310.00 → 1310.44] Exactly.
[1310.70 → 1311.74] I think that would be okay.
[1312.98 → 1313.30] Anyway,
[1313.56 → 1314.06] that was weird.
[1314.06 → 1314.36] Or Amazon's
[1314.36 → 1315.16] one-hour delivery.
[1315.40 → 1316.20] Oh my god.
[1316.54 → 1316.96] You could just
[1316.96 → 1317.72] one hour deliver
[1317.72 → 1319.42] jam to yourself.
[1319.52 → 1320.00] I'm going to check
[1320.00 → 1320.92] how the audio delay
[1320.92 → 1321.82] is doing right now.
[1321.82 → 1327.64] 100,000 from BR Gamer.
[1327.84 → 1328.16] Yeah.
[1328.50 → 1329.42] He might be onto something.
[1329.78 → 1330.08] Yeah.
[1330.42 → 1331.70] So apparently not good.
[1332.38 → 1333.70] Someone just yelled audio.
[1335.16 → 1336.46] Do another one of those.
[1337.54 → 1338.82] See if it helps anything.
[1339.54 → 1340.46] Audio is still ahead.
[1341.00 → 1341.70] Audio is ahead?
[1341.70 → 1341.76] Yeah.
[1348.12 → 1350.64] Was there any words on that?
[1350.64 → 1352.18] It feels like it's not
[1352.18 → 1353.34] even reading anything.
[1354.12 → 1354.80] One of the guys
[1354.80 → 1355.38] brought up something
[1355.38 → 1357.26] that you hear a hiccup
[1357.26 → 1358.54] once you take
[1358.54 → 1359.20] the noise.
[1360.12 → 1360.52] Mmm.
[1361.48 → 1362.44] It's not happening.
[1362.68 → 1363.70] I am clicking apply.
[1364.04 → 1364.82] Like it's saying
[1364.82 → 1365.86] that it's doing it.
[1365.88 → 1367.12] Maybe if you restart
[1367.12 → 1367.70] the screen
[1367.70 → 1368.74] that would actually
[1368.74 → 1369.32] make it
[1369.32 → 1370.68] go over.
[1371.60 → 1372.50] I don't.
[1372.68 → 1373.24] I don't.
[1373.24 → 1373.38] I don't.
[1373.38 → 1373.44] I don't.
[1373.44 → 1373.66] I don't.
[1374.66 → 1375.16] I don't.
[1375.36 → 1376.28] I see nothing.
[1376.46 → 1376.92] Oh god.
[1377.14 → 1377.90] I never see things
[1377.90 → 1378.68] I'm not supposed to see.
[1379.12 → 1379.52] Oh god.
[1380.64 → 1383.74] Do you want to go
[1383.74 → 1384.14] try it again?
[1384.14 → 1385.24] Go check it now Justin.
[1385.60 → 1386.64] Go try that.
[1388.98 → 1390.08] Just go.
[1392.06 → 1392.54] Anyway.
[1393.20 → 1393.98] Moving on
[1393.98 → 1394.98] to more topics.
[1396.56 → 1397.78] I can feel my face
[1397.78 → 1398.28] getting redder.
[1399.52 → 1400.42] I'm pretty sure
[1400.42 → 1401.04] you can see
[1401.04 → 1401.84] mine is redder.
[1402.04 → 1402.72] Oh my goodness.
[1402.86 → 1403.24] That was bad.
[1403.46 → 1404.00] So to explain
[1404.00 → 1404.74] what just happened
[1404.74 → 1406.08] I was trying to be quick
[1406.08 → 1406.56] and try to keep
[1406.56 → 1407.30] talking to you guys
[1407.30 → 1408.30] and what I did
[1408.30 → 1409.06] was I was adding
[1409.06 → 1409.88] audio delay
[1409.88 → 1411.54] to my system speakers
[1411.54 → 1413.62] instead of
[1413.62 → 1414.80] instead of adding
[1414.80 → 1415.40] audio delay
[1415.40 → 1416.10] to the microphone.
[1416.30 → 1417.08] Oh my god.
[1417.08 → 1418.38] So what I was hearing
[1418.38 → 1420.06] was being audio delayed
[1420.06 → 1421.84] by 3000 milliseconds
[1421.84 → 1424.46] and what I was saying
[1424.46 → 1425.60] was being audio delayed
[1425.60 → 1426.16] by nothing.
[1426.40 → 1426.80] Oh my god.
[1426.80 → 1428.10] So now what I'm saying
[1428.10 → 1429.10] is being audio delayed
[1429.10 → 1430.76] by 550 milliseconds
[1430.76 → 1432.76] and is apparently perfect.
[1433.70 → 1434.06] Sweet.
[1434.06 → 1435.84] My face is definitely
[1435.84 → 1437.26] full of blood right now
[1437.26 → 1439.54] and I feel very embarrassed
[1439.54 → 1441.92] and I kind of want to run away
[1441.92 → 1442.72] but I'm going to keep
[1442.72 → 1443.80] doing the WAN show
[1443.80 → 1445.28] because I love you guys
[1445.28 → 1447.64] and I want it to go well.
[1448.16 → 1449.14] Oh man.
[1449.84 → 1450.58] My bad.
[1451.32 → 1452.12] Let's just change it
[1452.12 → 1452.88] by 3000.
[1453.16 → 1453.72] Let's just, you know,
[1453.78 → 1454.94] that's like three seconds
[1454.94 → 1455.36] I think.
[1459.06 → 1459.50] Okay.
[1459.98 → 1460.42] Wow.
[1460.62 → 1460.88] Yeah.
[1460.88 → 1462.24] My like cheeks hurt.
[1462.44 → 1463.82] Anyway, moving on.
[1464.40 → 1467.40] Introducing GDDR5X.
[1467.50 → 1467.84] Yes.
[1468.00 → 1468.78] Higher density
[1468.78 → 1470.68] and faster data rates.
[1471.04 → 1471.62] So basically,
[1471.98 → 1472.96] up until now,
[1473.10 → 1474.00] four gigabyte modules
[1474.00 → 1474.82] were the highest density
[1474.82 → 1476.26] available for GDDR5.
[1476.78 → 1477.96] Now they can make
[1477.96 → 1480.08] eight gigabyte dense modules
[1480.08 → 1480.76] which is actually
[1480.76 → 1481.64] pretty badass
[1481.64 → 1482.52] because that's doubling
[1482.52 → 1483.44] the capacity
[1483.44 → 1484.68] which is actually
[1484.68 → 1485.42] fairly intense.
[1485.82 → 1486.76] Micron hinted that
[1486.76 → 1487.20] the
[1487.50 → 1488.74] that eight gigabit
[1488.74 → 1490.36] per second GDDR5 modules
[1490.36 → 1491.02] are in production.
[1491.02 → 1491.90] So that's
[1491.90 → 1493.40] one gigabit per second
[1493.40 → 1494.52] faster than the
[1494.52 → 1495.52] previous highest
[1495.52 → 1496.44] which was seven.
[1496.76 → 1497.28] That being said,
[1497.34 → 1498.28] people were overclocking
[1498.28 → 1498.72] and stuff.
[1498.82 → 1499.34] But this means
[1499.34 → 1500.22] you could overclock
[1500.22 → 1500.82] even more.
[1500.96 → 1501.12] Even more.
[1501.24 → 1501.40] Yeah.
[1501.54 → 1501.78] Exactly.
[1501.78 → 1502.36] That's good.
[1502.36 → 1505.38] They see eight gigabit
[1505.38 → 1505.70] per second
[1505.70 → 1506.58] the absolute peak
[1506.58 → 1508.14] for the GDDR5
[1508.14 → 1508.98] kind of platform
[1508.98 → 1510.38] in its current form
[1510.38 → 1511.32] but that's not
[1511.32 → 1512.04] astounding
[1512.04 → 1512.56] because I think
[1512.56 → 1513.24] a lot of people
[1513.24 → 1514.66] are expecting
[1514.66 → 1515.24] the future
[1515.24 → 1516.88] to be AMD's angle
[1516.88 → 1517.74] which is the stacking
[1517.74 → 1518.66] of stuff.
[1518.66 → 1520.40] So this is probably
[1520.40 → 1521.92] good if say
[1521.92 → 1522.72] Nvidia isn't going
[1522.72 → 1523.14] to move to
[1523.14 → 1524.18] HBM hybrid
[1524.18 → 1525.96] hybrid
[1525.96 → 1527.28] HB
[1527.28 → 1528.48] hybrid module
[1528.48 → 1528.86] something
[1528.86 → 1529.84] I don't know
[1529.84 → 1530.20] whatever
[1530.20 → 1531.42] the stacking memory
[1531.42 → 1531.90] from AMD
[1531.90 → 1532.86] if they're not going
[1532.86 → 1533.86] to go that route
[1533.86 → 1534.64] because usually
[1534.64 → 1535.22] the companies
[1535.22 → 1535.72] don't really like
[1535.72 → 1536.52] copying each other
[1536.52 → 1537.48] this will give them
[1537.48 → 1538.08] some more time
[1538.08 → 1538.88] to figure something out
[1538.88 → 1540.08] but I do expect
[1540.08 → 1540.90] everything is going
[1540.90 → 1541.42] to be stacking
[1541.42 → 1542.04] like crazy
[1542.04 → 1542.96] stacks on stacks
[1542.96 → 1543.36] on stacks
[1543.36 → 1544.06] on your graphics cards
[1544.06 → 1545.26] soon enough.
[1545.74 → 1547.44] So this is cool
[1547.44 → 1548.24] this is good
[1548.24 → 1549.80] personally I think
[1549.80 → 1550.80] stacking is still
[1550.80 → 1551.86] going to kind of be
[1551.86 → 1553.28] high performance memory
[1553.28 → 1554.48] what?
[1554.84 → 1555.38] high bandwidth
[1555.38 → 1556.16] there we go
[1556.16 → 1557.18] they also mentioned
[1557.18 → 1557.80] that the actual
[1557.80 → 1559.22] board could be smaller
[1559.22 → 1559.92] while still
[1559.92 → 1560.96] maintaining this power
[1560.96 → 1561.64] which is a big deal
[1561.64 → 1562.82] because in a lot
[1562.82 → 1563.64] of the smaller builds
[1563.64 → 1564.24] we're seeing these days
[1564.24 → 1565.00] the graphics card
[1565.00 → 1566.82] is the huge piece
[1566.82 → 1567.50] that's kind of
[1567.50 → 1568.30] somewhat of a problem
[1568.30 → 1568.54] right?
[1568.72 → 1569.28] Yeah and like
[1569.28 → 1569.74] people have been
[1569.74 → 1570.48] addressing that lately
[1570.48 → 1570.90] and that's been
[1570.90 → 1571.28] pretty cool
[1571.28 → 1572.74] because back in
[1572.74 → 1573.74] what was it
[1573.74 → 1575.18] 600 series
[1575.18 → 1577.98] or 700 series
[1577.98 → 1578.38] I don't remember
[1578.38 → 1579.06] what card it was
[1579.06 → 1580.14] but Linus and I
[1580.14 → 1581.12] made so many jokes
[1581.12 → 1581.82] because of the
[1581.82 → 1582.82] penis extension
[1582.82 → 1583.64] of the card
[1583.64 → 1584.56] which was basically
[1584.56 → 1585.58] the PCB ended
[1585.58 → 1586.48] and then they just
[1586.48 → 1587.02] put on like
[1587.02 → 1588.46] an extra plastic shroud
[1588.46 → 1589.34] to make it longer
[1589.34 → 1590.08] because they were like
[1590.08 → 1590.90] well short cards
[1590.90 → 1591.90] look stupid and dumb
[1591.90 → 1593.66] not true anymore
[1593.66 → 1594.44] a lot of people
[1594.44 → 1595.46] are going for short cards
[1595.46 → 1595.86] because they're going
[1595.86 → 1597.04] for little IT systems
[1597.04 → 1598.98] you only sometimes
[1598.98 → 1599.96] need two sticks of RAM
[1599.96 → 1601.06] because the high capacity
[1601.06 → 1602.06] RAM can get you
[1602.06 → 1603.24] a ton of memory
[1603.24 → 1605.14] you get huge capacity
[1605.14 → 1605.74] RAM sticks
[1605.74 → 1606.38] you can get a
[1606.38 → 1607.36] badass graphics card
[1607.36 → 1608.40] which is nice and short
[1608.40 → 1609.08] and you can make
[1609.08 → 1609.94] this little tiny
[1609.94 → 1610.90] awesome system
[1610.90 → 1612.28] of epic ness
[1612.28 → 1612.94] you're not taking
[1612.94 → 1613.84] any big losses
[1613.84 → 1614.84] going with the tiny
[1614.84 → 1615.36] little builds
[1615.36 → 1616.10] as you would have
[1616.10 → 1616.78] in the past
[1616.78 → 1617.24] yes
[1617.24 → 1617.76] you know you're
[1617.76 → 1618.46] getting a lot of
[1618.46 → 1619.34] the same things
[1619.34 → 1619.94] if not better
[1619.94 → 1620.40] yeah
[1620.40 → 1621.46] in a smaller
[1621.46 → 1622.36] and especially for
[1622.36 → 1622.86] guys like us
[1622.86 → 1623.98] a more laudable case
[1623.98 → 1624.46] yeah
[1624.46 → 1626.02] no that's a huge thing
[1626.02 → 1626.96] I saw a bunch of
[1626.96 → 1627.50] we were just
[1627.50 → 1628.60] this is my brother
[1628.60 → 1628.98] for the people
[1628.98 → 1629.54] that didn't get that
[1629.54 → 1630.26] earlier in the stream
[1630.26 → 1631.46] we were just at the
[1631.46 → 1631.86] yes
[1631.86 → 1632.44] bro show
[1632.44 → 1633.44] welcome to the bro show
[1633.44 → 1635.68] we were just at the
[1635.68 → 1636.84] BYOC bring your own
[1636.84 → 1637.96] computer land at PAX
[1637.96 → 1639.18] Prime 2015
[1639.18 → 1641.00] and there was
[1641.00 → 1641.76] yeah there's a bunch
[1641.76 → 1642.90] of little tiny systems
[1642.90 → 1643.76] one of my favourite
[1643.76 → 1644.48] things about lands
[1644.48 → 1645.12] is you get the
[1645.12 → 1645.92] combination of like
[1645.92 → 1647.04] the person who made
[1647.04 → 1648.00] a computer into a
[1648.00 → 1649.00] Team Fortress 2 turrets
[1649.00 → 1649.74] which was moving
[1649.74 → 1650.36] that was awesome
[1650.36 → 1652.06] you get the guy who
[1652.06 → 1653.16] made a computer
[1653.16 → 1653.90] into a suitcase
[1653.90 → 1654.76] that had a monitor
[1654.76 → 1655.24] in it
[1655.24 → 1656.20] and then you have
[1656.20 → 1657.54] like the computer
[1657.54 → 1658.44] that probably
[1658.44 → 1659.84] got its case
[1659.84 → 1660.44] from like
[1660.44 → 1661.68] 1998
[1661.68 → 1663.70] and has had like
[1663.70 → 1665.50] random hand-me-down
[1665.50 → 1666.40] part upgrades
[1666.40 → 1667.24] ever since then
[1667.24 → 1667.90] and he's just
[1667.90 → 1668.68] still landing
[1668.68 → 1669.20] still gaming
[1669.20 → 1670.12] and he's fine
[1670.12 → 1671.46] and he's trudging along
[1671.46 → 1672.18] slugging it out
[1672.18 → 1673.14] you've got all
[1673.14 → 1673.96] the different variances
[1673.96 → 1674.54] and I think that's
[1674.54 → 1674.94] pretty cool
[1674.94 → 1675.86] but this will allow
[1675.86 → 1676.40] people to do
[1676.40 → 1677.82] cool little tiny builds
[1677.82 → 1678.72] and that's awesome
[1678.72 → 1679.28] well this will
[1679.28 → 1680.86] help allow people
[1680.86 → 1681.28] to do that
[1681.28 → 1681.78] yes absolutely
[1681.78 → 1682.72] definitely not the
[1682.72 → 1683.30] only component
[1683.30 → 1684.54] and AMD's doing
[1684.54 → 1685.38] their own stuff as well
[1685.38 → 1685.96] so I can't
[1685.96 → 1686.94] I can't take them
[1686.94 → 1687.46] down a notch
[1687.46 → 1688.66] this is just a good
[1688.66 → 1689.02] thing
[1689.02 → 1689.80] it also helps with
[1689.80 → 1691.14] SLI or crossfire
[1691.14 → 1692.36] you know
[1692.36 → 1692.86] because your RAM
[1692.86 → 1693.20] is definitely
[1693.20 → 1693.82] limited in that
[1693.82 → 1694.30] situation
[1694.30 → 1694.64] so
[1694.64 → 1695.28] yeah because
[1695.28 → 1695.72] it doesn't
[1695.72 → 1696.12] it doesn't
[1696.12 → 1696.92] it's not additive
[1696.92 → 1697.50] yeah
[1697.50 → 1698.14] which is cool
[1698.14 → 1698.90] so you can get
[1698.90 → 1699.86] a bunch more memory
[1699.86 → 1700.92] and then two cars
[1700.92 → 1701.44] that are the same
[1701.44 → 1702.02] and then you have
[1702.02 → 1703.04] a bunch more memory
[1703.04 → 1703.90] and everyone wants
[1703.90 → 1704.96] more screens these days
[1704.96 → 1705.26] you know
[1705.26 → 1705.70] it'll help you
[1705.70 → 1706.56] those guys who want
[1706.56 → 1707.16] triple screens
[1707.16 → 1707.94] I'm not there yet
[1707.94 → 1709.34] still rocking two
[1709.34 → 1709.84] but
[1709.84 → 1710.84] I'm trying to get more
[1710.84 → 1711.56] trying to get more
[1711.56 → 1712.46] I have two at home
[1712.46 → 1713.42] and I have three at work
[1713.42 → 1714.24] and I want like
[1714.24 → 1715.32] five at work
[1715.32 → 1716.30] and I want like
[1716.30 → 1718.16] maybe more than five at home
[1718.16 → 1719.20] who's got the overhead
[1719.20 → 1719.86] display
[1719.86 → 1720.58] um
[1720.58 → 1721.26] Barnacles
[1721.26 → 1721.76] Barnacles
[1721.76 → 1722.08] yeah
[1722.08 → 1723.38] I want one of those
[1723.38 → 1724.72] two not nearly as big as his
[1724.72 → 1725.74] his like
[1725.74 → 1726.42] all
[1726.42 → 1727.22] that's all TVs
[1727.22 → 1728.18] and they're giant
[1728.18 → 1729.58] I don't necessarily want that
[1729.58 → 1731.38] I want a monitor
[1731.38 → 1732.48] on a tilt down though
[1732.48 → 1733.08] and I want like
[1733.08 → 1734.40] small auxiliary monitors
[1734.40 → 1735.42] for server monitoring
[1735.42 → 1735.86] and stuff
[1735.86 → 1736.36] that's awesome
[1736.36 → 1737.00] I want to be able to like
[1737.00 → 1738.52] play Eve and mine up here
[1738.52 → 1738.88] and like
[1738.88 → 1739.94] play Hearthstone here
[1739.94 → 1740.98] and world of tanks here
[1740.98 → 1742.16] and monitor the forum here
[1742.16 → 1743.50] and monitor a server up there
[1743.50 → 1743.78] and just
[1743.78 → 1745.00] all the things
[1745.00 → 1745.78] I want to feel like
[1745.78 → 1746.30] I'm in
[1746.30 → 1746.78] like
[1746.78 → 1747.64] people say like
[1747.64 → 1747.98] oh
[1747.98 → 1748.48] Reddit
[1748.48 → 1749.34] battle stations
[1749.34 → 1749.66] or whatever
[1749.66 → 1750.56] I want to legitimately
[1750.56 → 1751.28] be able to have
[1751.28 → 1751.86] a battle station
[1751.86 → 1752.54] nice
[1752.54 → 1753.36] I want to have like
[1753.36 → 1754.82] my racing wheel set up
[1754.82 → 1755.54] and my joystick
[1755.54 → 1756.62] and throttle set up
[1756.62 → 1757.40] and like
[1757.40 → 1758.68] a bazillion and a half
[1758.68 → 1759.24] monitors
[1759.24 → 1761.06] and keyboard and mouse
[1761.06 → 1762.26] and a controller
[1762.26 → 1763.20] and just be like
[1763.20 → 1764.74] I can do everything
[1764.74 → 1765.78] that's
[1765.78 → 1766.50] that's what I want
[1766.50 → 1766.98] anyway
[1766.98 → 1768.16] you have to be able to be racing
[1768.16 → 1769.10] have voice controls
[1769.10 → 1769.98] for Hearthstone
[1769.98 → 1770.30] yes
[1770.30 → 1771.54] voice controls for Eve
[1771.54 → 1771.96] yeah
[1771.96 → 1772.62] yeah
[1772.62 → 1773.52] just keep it going
[1773.52 → 1773.98] card
[1773.98 → 1774.98] stream at the same time
[1774.98 → 1776.34] use your battle cry
[1776.34 → 1778.14] on enemy card 4
[1778.14 → 1779.06] thank you
[1779.06 → 1780.80] also mine that rock
[1780.80 → 1781.90] and uh
[1781.90 → 1783.36] and I need to drive a tank
[1783.36 → 1784.20] although I probably
[1784.20 → 1784.98] can't do that by voice
[1784.98 → 1786.10] anyway
[1786.10 → 1787.20] um
[1787.20 → 1789.12] let me find another topic
[1789.12 → 1790.40] Wikipedia editors
[1790.40 → 1792.24] turn to blackmail
[1792.24 → 1793.26] this is
[1793.26 → 1795.68] kind of horrible
[1795.68 → 1796.54] because you know what
[1796.54 → 1797.98] I actually really like Wikipedia
[1797.98 → 1799.66] Wikipedia is super badass
[1799.66 → 1800.10] and
[1800.10 → 1800.92] if you've gone to school
[1800.92 → 1801.76] in the last decade
[1801.76 → 1802.68] you like Wikipedia
[1802.68 → 1804.12] Wikipedia has gotten
[1804.12 → 1805.02] so many people
[1805.02 → 1805.70] through their degrees
[1805.70 → 1806.96] so a lot of people
[1806.96 → 1808.78] owe like their entire degree
[1808.78 → 1809.32] to Wikipedia
[1809.32 → 1810.04] which is
[1810.04 → 1810.96] pretty cool
[1810.96 → 1812.18] but editors at Wikipedia
[1812.18 → 1813.38] have allegedly started
[1813.38 → 1815.02] contacting small businesses
[1815.02 → 1816.40] and lesser known celebrities
[1816.40 → 1817.72] telling them that they need
[1817.72 → 1818.48] to pay up
[1818.48 → 1819.60] or have their entries
[1819.60 → 1820.44] edited to
[1820.44 → 1821.26] Oblivion
[1821.26 → 1821.96] Oblivion
[1821.96 → 1822.68] that's just
[1822.68 → 1824.40] that's petty
[1824.40 → 1825.62] and that's garbage
[1825.62 → 1826.62] very evil
[1826.62 → 1827.80] it's for hundreds of pounds
[1827.80 → 1829.06] so this was uh
[1829.06 → 1830.72] posted probably not
[1830.72 → 1832.36] on a North American
[1832.36 → 1833.04] website
[1833.04 → 1834.24] it's fudzilla.com
[1834.24 → 1834.86] so I don't know
[1834.86 → 1835.82] but hundreds of pounds
[1835.82 → 1836.68] as in monies
[1836.68 → 1837.64] um
[1837.64 → 1838.28] I'm gonna post this
[1838.28 → 1838.92] in the Twitch chat
[1838.92 → 1839.56] so you guys can see
[1839.56 → 1840.48] what we're talking about
[1840.48 → 1842.80] book book book book book book book book
[1842.80 → 1843.80] book book book book
[1843.80 → 1844.96] book book book book
[1844.96 → 1846.26] book book book
[1846.26 → 1846.74] and then I'm going to switch
[1846.74 → 1847.36] to my screen
[1847.36 → 1848.86] there we go
[1848.86 → 1849.90] I make the computer noises
[1849.90 → 1850.66] so that you don't have
[1850.66 → 1851.72] to assume that they're there
[1851.72 → 1853.50] the stream PC is not
[1853.50 → 1854.22] doing things
[1854.22 → 1855.98] there we go
[1855.98 → 1856.62] hooray
[1856.62 → 1857.62] um
[1857.62 → 1858.90] yeah
[1858.90 → 1859.92] so apparently
[1859.92 → 1860.84] this guy
[1860.84 → 1862.66] got edited to God
[1862.66 → 1863.64] which is
[1863.64 → 1864.74] not a thing
[1864.74 → 1865.66] anyway
[1865.66 → 1866.44] long article
[1866.44 → 1867.34] I need to get back
[1867.34 → 1867.86] to my sheet
[1867.86 → 1869.02] so we're not actually
[1869.02 → 1869.82] gonna look at that
[1869.82 → 1871.00] uh-huh
[1871.00 → 1872.30] tricked
[1872.30 → 1873.42] um
[1873.42 → 1874.02] they offered
[1874.02 → 1875.50] their powers as editors
[1875.50 → 1876.56] to keep the page up
[1876.56 → 1877.68] if the fee is met
[1877.68 → 1878.38] so basically
[1878.38 → 1879.38] uh
[1879.38 → 1881.34] if you want your Wikipedia page up
[1881.34 → 1882.54] sometimes if
[1882.54 → 1882.98] if
[1882.98 → 1884.54] if what you're trying to talk about
[1884.54 → 1885.02] isn't
[1885.02 → 1885.94] like
[1885.94 → 1886.56] worth
[1886.56 → 1887.62] talking about
[1887.62 → 1888.50] if you're like
[1888.50 → 1889.48] my name
[1889.48 → 1890.54] is Fred
[1890.54 → 1892.16] and I'm in grade 4
[1892.16 → 1893.58] and I really like apples
[1893.58 → 1895.96] I don't think you really get a Wikipedia page
[1895.96 → 1896.66] um
[1896.66 → 1897.18] so I think
[1897.18 → 1897.72] good healthy choice Fred
[1897.72 → 1898.72] yes actually
[1898.72 → 1899.12] apples
[1899.12 → 1899.40] good
[1899.40 → 1900.02] good move
[1900.02 → 1901.22] apple a day
[1901.22 → 1902.24] keeps something away
[1902.24 → 1902.78] I don't remember
[1902.78 → 1903.34] dentist
[1903.34 → 1903.82] doctor
[1903.82 → 1904.44] I don't know
[1904.44 → 1905.22] either way
[1905.22 → 1906.18] um
[1906.18 → 1907.06] so basically
[1907.06 → 1907.76] I think they're
[1907.76 → 1909.52] they're claiming that they can help you keep it up
[1909.52 → 1912.16] alleged offenders will contact the person or business
[1912.16 → 1913.74] on behalf of Wikipedia
[1913.74 → 1914.60] uh
[1914.60 → 1915.96] soon after their page is created
[1915.96 → 1917.18] Wikipedia has started
[1917.18 → 1917.72] uh
[1917.72 → 1919.94] stated that this is a coordinated group
[1919.94 → 1920.56] which is
[1920.56 → 1921.76] not better
[1921.76 → 1922.36] no
[1922.36 → 1923.36] um
[1923.36 → 1924.18] also
[1924.18 → 1925.34] they have since purged
[1925.34 → 1927.70] 381 sock puppet accounts
[1927.70 → 1929.94] and 210 articles created by them
[1929.94 → 1933.18] I'm not entirely sure what sock puppet means
[1933.18 → 1934.08] um
[1934.08 → 1935.78] but judging by sock puppets
[1935.78 → 1936.76] like a robot account
[1936.76 → 1937.46] I'm assuming it's uh
[1937.46 → 1938.12] um
[1938.12 → 1939.80] an account that those guys will use
[1939.80 → 1941.10] to screw around with things
[1941.10 → 1941.34] right
[1941.34 → 1942.18] that don't look like that
[1942.18 → 1942.86] throw away account
[1942.86 → 1943.22] yeah
[1943.22 → 1944.52] uh
[1944.52 → 1946.16] Wikipedia Foundation blog post
[1946.16 → 1946.90] stated
[1946.90 → 1947.64] uh
[1947.64 → 1949.96] neutrality is key to ensuring Wikipedia's quality
[1949.96 → 1952.08] although it does not happen often
[1952.08 → 1956.90] undisclosed paid advocacy editing may represent a serious conflict of interest
[1956.90 → 1957.18] it
[1957.18 → 1958.06] it would
[1958.06 → 1961.06] and could compromise the quality of content on Wikipedia
[1961.06 → 1961.40] it
[1961.40 → 1961.94] it would
[1961.94 → 1962.62] yeah absolutely
[1962.62 → 1964.08] and it probably has at this point
[1964.08 → 1965.54] so hopefully they
[1965.54 → 1966.74] they deal with that
[1966.74 → 1967.90] because Wikipedia is awesome
[1967.90 → 1968.76] and I wouldn't that
[1968.76 → 1970.08] I wouldn't want that to become
[1970.08 → 1971.48] an actual problem
[1971.48 → 1972.34] in the future
[1972.34 → 1973.54] um
[1973.54 → 1977.46] EVE will soon be entering the enthusiast gaming notebook market
[1977.46 → 1978.80] this is not that surprising
[1978.80 → 1979.46] uh
[1979.46 → 1979.54] no
[1979.54 → 1979.96] every
[1979.96 → 1980.84] every kind of
[1980.84 → 1983.18] once every few years
[1983.18 → 1984.12] EVE will be like
[1984.12 → 1985.12] and
[1985.12 → 1986.38] and here's another product line
[1986.38 → 1986.72] yep
[1986.72 → 1988.40] and they seem to do pretty well
[1988.40 → 1989.02] in all of them
[1989.02 → 1989.74] so that's pretty cool
[1989.74 → 1992.62] notebook will be capable of heavy overclocking
[1992.62 → 1993.22] so that's
[1993.22 → 1994.22] interesting
[1994.22 → 1994.98] we'll see
[1994.98 → 1995.94] notebooks traditionally
[1995.94 → 1997.70] not usually that great
[1997.70 → 1999.04] some of them have been pretty good
[1999.04 → 1999.40] actually
[1999.40 → 2000.66] I know a few guys that have gotten some
[2000.66 → 2002.56] pretty impressive overclocks on notebooks
[2002.56 → 2004.10] and had them not throttle
[2004.10 → 2005.48] so that's interesting
[2005.48 → 2006.52] but we'll see
[2006.52 → 2008.20] if they're capable of heavy overclocking
[2008.20 → 2008.86] we will see
[2008.86 → 2010.70] featuring the new Skylike mobile
[2010.70 → 2011.14] uh
[2011.14 → 2011.50] mobile
[2011.50 → 2012.12] mobile
[2012.12 → 2012.70] mobile
[2012.70 → 2013.30] CPU
[2013.30 → 2014.04] uh
[2014.04 → 2015.94] 17 inch thin gaming notebook
[2015.94 → 2018.18] with very high-end hardware
[2018.18 → 2019.20] they said Skylike
[2019.20 → 2019.86] so probably
[2019.86 → 2021.94] really high-end mobile cards as well
[2021.94 → 2022.54] I would assume
[2022.54 → 2024.40] plan to launch late 2015
[2024.40 → 2025.48] or early 2016
[2025.48 → 2028.18] 100% EVE design from the ground up
[2028.18 → 2029.40] which is also not surprising
[2029.40 → 2029.74] yeah
[2029.74 → 2030.26] uh
[2030.26 → 2032.28] speculated that the K-series mobile SKU
[2032.28 → 2033.52] will be included
[2033.52 → 2034.42] so K-series
[2034.42 → 2035.04] um
[2035.04 → 2035.90] processors
[2035.90 → 2036.46] yep
[2036.46 → 2038.20] but that has not yet been confirmed
[2038.20 → 2039.40] although if they're saying like
[2039.40 → 2040.54] it's going to be overclockable
[2040.54 → 2041.86] heavy overclocking
[2041.86 → 2043.34] very high-end hardware
[2043.34 → 2045.52] it's probably going to be a thing
[2045.52 → 2046.16] kinda needs to have that K
[2046.16 → 2046.98] yeah
[2046.98 → 2049.20] if it does use a K-series chip
[2049.20 → 2049.76] it will feature
[2049.76 → 2050.70] four cores
[2050.70 → 2052.08] eight total threads
[2052.08 → 2053.86] stock clock of 3.2 gigahertz
[2053.86 → 2055.72] with a 3.6 gigahertz turbo
[2055.72 → 2057.30] and 45 watt TDP
[2057.30 → 2058.92] those numbers are just insane
[2058.92 → 2060.38] if you got into computers
[2060.38 → 2061.60] when I did or earlier
[2061.60 → 2062.08] yeah
[2062.08 → 2063.70] like that's just absurd
[2063.70 → 2064.84] all of those things
[2064.84 → 2065.56] the amount of threads
[2065.56 → 2066.18] the amount of cores
[2066.18 → 2067.68] the speed
[2067.68 → 2068.80] the TDP
[2068.80 → 2069.86] everything is just nuts
[2069.86 → 2070.36] uh
[2070.36 → 2071.74] the thickness of the notebook
[2071.74 → 2073.46] is not expected to be an issue
[2073.46 → 2075.22] as Skylike has a very good
[2075.22 → 2076.72] power performance envelope
[2076.72 → 2078.28] and has increased power
[2078.28 → 2079.42] from overclocking
[2079.42 → 2079.96] uh
[2079.96 → 2080.62] is minimal
[2080.62 → 2081.90] compared to previous generation
[2081.90 → 2082.50] GPUs
[2082.50 → 2083.50] uh
[2083.50 → 2084.04] CPUs
[2084.04 → 2084.32] sorry
[2084.32 → 2086.12] that's true
[2086.12 → 2087.48] but if you're going with the
[2087.48 → 2088.34] uh
[2088.34 → 2089.80] heavy overclocking
[2089.80 → 2091.26] and very high-end hardware thing
[2091.26 → 2091.56] yes
[2091.56 → 2093.68] so far we're just talking about the CPU
[2093.68 → 2095.60] I'm interested in the GPU
[2095.60 → 2096.10] yeah
[2096.10 → 2096.82] and
[2096.82 → 2098.28] heavy amounts of overclocking
[2098.28 → 2099.08] I'm going to want
[2099.08 → 2101.08] if that's what I'm buying this laptop for
[2101.08 → 2102.02] I'm probably going to want
[2102.02 → 2103.76] a fairly excessive amount of cooling
[2103.76 → 2104.94] um
[2104.94 → 2106.02] so if they're like
[2106.02 → 2108.28] they seem like very conflicting
[2108.28 → 2109.04] absolutely
[2109.04 → 2111.70] it's going to have the most badass hardware
[2111.70 → 2113.06] it's going to be superfast
[2113.06 → 2114.48] you're going to be able to overclock the crap out of it
[2114.48 → 2115.24] and it's going to be thin
[2115.24 → 2116.36] like that's
[2116.36 → 2117.04] that's awesome
[2117.04 → 2118.36] if you can get all those things to be true
[2118.36 → 2118.58] but
[2118.58 → 2118.76] yeah
[2118.76 → 2119.86] yeah
[2119.86 → 2121.10] seems like they're claiming quite a bit
[2121.10 → 2123.12] they don't have a long time to actually come out with it
[2123.12 → 2124.58] because if they're saying end of 2015
[2124.58 → 2125.30] you know
[2125.30 → 2126.42] September is going to fly by
[2126.42 → 2127.04] those people
[2127.04 → 2127.38] you know
[2127.38 → 2128.16] summer's over
[2128.16 → 2128.80] school's starting
[2128.80 → 2129.92] September always disappears
[2129.92 → 2131.02] at least for me, it does
[2131.02 → 2131.92] and then you know
[2131.92 → 2132.82] we're into October already
[2132.82 → 2133.82] the end of the year is going to be here
[2133.82 → 2134.28] so this
[2134.28 → 2135.60] this is around the corner
[2135.60 → 2136.42] as far as I'm concerned
[2136.42 → 2136.92] yeah
[2136.92 → 2137.36] um
[2137.36 → 2138.72] so they're going to have this stuff figured out
[2138.72 → 2139.84] personally
[2139.84 → 2142.16] I'm kind of hedging on the fact that they might be
[2142.16 → 2143.24] claiming too much
[2143.24 → 2144.40] but hopefully not
[2144.40 → 2144.98] hopefully not
[2144.98 → 2146.66] this was the first year I actually took a laptop
[2146.66 → 2147.70] to BYOC
[2147.70 → 2148.18] yeah
[2148.18 → 2149.10] I had my own monitor
[2149.10 → 2150.12] but uh
[2150.12 → 2150.94] being able to have
[2150.94 → 2151.90] if you're able to
[2151.90 → 2153.42] have a gaming laptop
[2153.42 → 2155.30] that you can bring around for LAN's
[2155.30 → 2155.80] and things like that
[2155.80 → 2156.00] it's
[2156.00 → 2156.76] it's really nice
[2156.76 → 2157.32] it's pretty nice
[2157.32 → 2158.20] slides into your backpack
[2158.20 → 2160.20] man I had an easy time this year
[2160.20 → 2161.30] one of the cool things about that too
[2161.30 → 2163.16] is you don't have to worry about people stealing your stuff
[2163.16 → 2164.42] because you can just drop it into your laptop
[2164.42 → 2165.26] and take off at the end
[2165.26 → 2165.52] exactly
[2165.52 → 2166.14] which is nice
[2166.14 → 2166.84] um
[2166.84 → 2168.90] they did kind of save their butts a little bit
[2168.90 → 2170.60] and say or early 2016
[2170.60 → 2171.02] yeah
[2171.02 → 2171.32] yeah
[2171.32 → 2173.96] so if they don't make it by that late 2015 line
[2173.96 → 2174.30] they
[2174.30 → 2175.60] they can still kind of pour over
[2175.60 → 2176.22] which is nice
[2176.22 → 2178.16] you would assume they would try to hit it for Christmas
[2178.16 → 2179.02] but uh
[2179.02 → 2180.10] I'm wondering if they're just going
[2180.10 → 2180.36] you know
[2180.36 → 2181.42] we might not make it
[2181.42 → 2181.92] kind of deal
[2181.92 → 2182.40] yeah
[2182.40 → 2182.80] yeah
[2182.80 → 2184.12] I think that's the goal though
[2184.12 → 2185.10] you're probably right
[2185.10 → 2185.84] uh
[2185.84 → 2186.94] more laptop talk
[2186.94 → 2190.06] Asus refreshes DOG laptops with G752
[2190.06 → 2192.64] I used the G751 at that LAN
[2192.64 → 2193.96] so here's the two
[2193.96 → 2194.36] yeah
[2194.36 → 2194.96] um
[2194.96 → 2196.16] and liquid cooled
[2196.16 → 2197.84] GX700 series
[2197.84 → 2198.28] yeah
[2198.28 → 2198.90] this
[2198.90 → 2199.84] is interesting
[2199.84 → 2200.40] yes
[2200.40 → 2202.52] so I'm going to try to get the topic up on here
[2202.52 → 2205.54] the GX700 being teased as well
[2205.54 → 2206.46] um
[2206.46 → 2208.44] that's the liquid-cooled one
[2208.44 → 2209.74] let me see if I can get the topic up here
[2209.74 → 2210.04] sorry
[2210.04 → 2210.50] one second
[2210.50 → 2212.32] so this is from a Nanotech
[2212.32 → 2213.58] I'm going to post this in the chat
[2213.58 → 2214.98] um
[2214.98 → 2219.50] my laptop is not super happy about things right now
[2219.50 → 2222.06] very interesting attachment that they're going to have for this
[2222.06 → 2223.58] I don't fully understand how it works yet
[2223.58 → 2226.50] I'm not sure if they've released enough information to fully understand how it works
[2226.50 → 2226.78] right
[2226.78 → 2228.00] but it does look like
[2228.00 → 2229.46] I could be wrong on this
[2229.46 → 2232.64] but it appears like there's a closed loop water cooling system built in
[2232.64 → 2236.60] but then you can attach this huge unit that just kind of chunks into the back of it
[2236.60 → 2239.10] which would essentially extend that water cooling
[2239.10 → 2240.04] um
[2240.04 → 2242.04] because if there's a water cooling attachment without that
[2242.04 → 2244.38] how does it cool unless there is already an established closed loop
[2244.38 → 2245.60] it could be like
[2245.60 → 2246.20] okay
[2246.20 → 2247.30] full disclosure
[2247.30 → 2248.22] I was busy
[2248.22 → 2250.32] filming a super fun stuff before the show
[2250.32 → 2251.76] but what this could be
[2251.76 → 2253.22] is very similar to
[2253.22 → 2255.22] the like uh
[2255.22 → 2256.60] what was that card
[2256.60 → 2257.08] Asus
[2257.08 → 2257.96] I don't remember the name
[2257.96 → 2258.66] Poseidon
[2258.66 → 2259.82] uh
[2259.82 → 2261.42] I'm having trouble with the name right now
[2261.42 → 2262.52] twitch chat will correct me
[2262.52 → 2263.06] but the
[2263.06 → 2264.52] the Asus Poseidon where
[2264.52 → 2266.60] it's an air cooled
[2266.60 → 2268.16] graphics card
[2268.16 → 2269.30] that looks like it
[2269.30 → 2269.54] yeah
[2269.54 → 2270.70] it's an air-cooled graphics card
[2270.70 → 2272.00] but it has fittings
[2272.00 → 2273.80] and this could be just basically
[2273.80 → 2275.46] quick disconnect fittings on this guy
[2275.46 → 2276.14] so
[2276.14 → 2277.18] it's air cooled
[2277.18 → 2278.42] and then you can click in
[2278.42 → 2279.82] and turn it into a water cooling system
[2279.82 → 2281.00] that could be what it is
[2281.00 → 2281.58] again
[2281.58 → 2282.24] full disclosure
[2282.24 → 2283.28] I haven't uh
[2283.28 → 2284.60] I haven't read it
[2284.60 → 2285.26] that could be
[2285.26 → 2285.54] yeah
[2285.54 → 2287.08] it's basically got to be either or
[2287.08 → 2287.98] because uh
[2287.98 → 2288.86] it's good
[2288.86 → 2290.02] now I don't know a lot about this
[2290.02 → 2290.70] Poseidon card
[2290.70 → 2291.80] how well does it work
[2291.80 → 2292.90] I always
[2292.90 → 2293.90] I'm always scared
[2293.90 → 2295.04] when a tool
[2295.04 → 2295.84] says you know
[2295.84 → 2296.62] I can do two things
[2296.62 → 2297.90] these are the two things that I do
[2297.90 → 2298.74] because generally a tool
[2298.74 → 2300.18] that will do one of those things
[2300.18 → 2300.82] does it better
[2300.82 → 2302.42] than uh
[2302.42 → 2303.66] the tool that can do two things
[2303.66 → 2303.90] so
[2303.90 → 2305.12] I'm not 100% sure
[2305.12 → 2306.52] but it's a fascinating idea
[2306.52 → 2307.12] and we're talking about
[2307.12 → 2308.04] overclocking and lands
[2308.04 → 2308.86] and all that kind of stuff
[2308.86 → 2310.44] usually what I find
[2310.44 → 2311.90] like with the Poseidon
[2311.90 → 2313.06] I actually not that long ago
[2313.06 → 2314.24] did a review of a
[2314.24 → 2315.04] Total
[2315.04 → 2315.64] two-in-one
[2315.64 → 2316.78] cooling style card
[2316.78 → 2317.90] um
[2317.90 → 2319.44] I think that might actually
[2319.44 → 2320.54] be in the background here
[2320.54 → 2321.90] one of them
[2321.90 → 2322.42] yeah the
[2322.42 → 2323.24] the Arctic
[2323.24 → 2323.78] something
[2323.78 → 2324.56] you can see it
[2324.56 → 2325.76] I'll show with my mouse
[2325.76 → 2326.94] uh
[2326.94 → 2327.90] this one
[2327.90 → 2328.76] wait no
[2328.76 → 2329.72] that's not what you're seeing
[2329.72 → 2331.04] this one
[2331.04 → 2331.64] right there
[2331.64 → 2332.70] that has two little
[2332.70 → 2333.54] water cooling
[2333.54 → 2333.94] uh
[2333.94 → 2334.68] fittings right there
[2334.68 → 2335.36] uh
[2335.36 → 2336.06] usually what I find
[2336.06 → 2336.42] is that
[2336.42 → 2337.30] the air cooling
[2337.30 → 2338.74] is okay
[2338.74 → 2339.40] right
[2339.40 → 2340.32] even if it has like
[2340.32 → 2340.52] pretty
[2340.52 → 2341.14] like that one had
[2341.14 → 2342.20] pretty beast air cooling
[2342.20 → 2342.86] built into it
[2342.86 → 2343.88] but because of like
[2343.88 → 2345.02] the water block and stuff
[2345.02 → 2346.24] and needing to transfer through it
[2346.24 → 2347.52] it usually ends up being
[2347.52 → 2348.18] okay
[2348.18 → 2349.10] instead of
[2349.10 → 2349.64] great
[2349.64 → 2351.24] as it's actually made to be
[2351.24 → 2352.16] but then you have
[2352.16 → 2353.02] water cooling options
[2353.02 → 2354.02] and then that water cooling option
[2354.02 → 2354.72] is usually sick
[2354.72 → 2355.48] so with this laptop
[2355.48 → 2356.90] you could go to your work
[2356.90 → 2359.18] do whatever you need to do
[2359.18 → 2360.06] and
[2360.06 → 2361.42] it'll probably be fine
[2361.42 → 2362.08] because
[2362.08 → 2362.88] you won't
[2362.88 → 2363.94] maybe push it as hard
[2363.94 → 2365.58] and then you could dock it at home
[2365.58 → 2365.98] yeah
[2365.98 → 2366.44] into water cooling
[2366.44 → 2366.94] and then game
[2366.94 → 2368.18] and that's actually a pretty cool
[2368.18 → 2368.86] use case
[2368.86 → 2369.84] I think that makes sense
[2369.84 → 2370.82] and just the fact that it's
[2370.82 → 2371.38] quick connects
[2371.38 → 2371.86] uh
[2371.86 → 2373.00] can be really good for people
[2373.00 → 2374.10] who don't want to spend
[2374.10 → 2375.38] if you've ever
[2375.38 → 2376.48] completely water cooled
[2376.48 → 2376.90] your computer
[2376.90 → 2377.54] it takes time
[2377.54 → 2377.96] and effort
[2377.96 → 2379.04] and a bit of maintenance
[2379.04 → 2379.48] yeah
[2379.48 → 2379.72] you know
[2379.72 → 2380.82] that could be a really simple idea
[2380.82 → 2381.96] for someone who wants to just get in
[2381.96 → 2382.26] get out
[2382.26 → 2383.54] and not spend a lot of time with it
[2383.54 → 2383.80] yeah
[2383.80 → 2384.72] um
[2384.72 → 2386.08] so again just more options
[2386.08 → 2386.60] I think
[2386.60 → 2387.30] you know
[2387.30 → 2387.86] the laptop
[2387.86 → 2388.58] the notebook market
[2388.58 → 2389.76] is just getting bigger and bigger
[2389.76 → 2390.48] um
[2390.48 → 2392.24] just with how much more powerful
[2392.24 → 2392.98] uh
[2392.98 → 2393.80] they're able to build them
[2393.80 → 2394.22] yeah
[2394.22 → 2394.82] it's really cool
[2394.82 → 2395.94] I was kind of anti-laptop
[2395.94 → 2396.52] for a while there
[2396.52 → 2397.40] to be completely honest
[2397.40 → 2398.50] just desktops all the way
[2398.50 → 2399.46] and I still kind of am
[2399.46 → 2399.66] but
[2399.66 → 2401.20] they're really shortening that gap
[2401.20 → 2402.62] I'm still
[2402.62 → 2403.90] like to be fair
[2403.90 → 2405.04] I'm talking about cool
[2405.04 → 2406.26] cool gaming laptops
[2406.26 → 2409.12] gaming laptops are interesting
[2409.12 → 2410.86] I still like the idea
[2410.86 → 2413.54] of a beast desktop at home
[2413.54 → 2413.76] yeah
[2413.76 → 2414.48] and then a like
[2414.48 → 2417.04] more business-y styled laptop
[2417.04 → 2417.40] mm-hmm
[2417.40 → 2418.18] just because
[2418.18 → 2419.72] I like my laptops running
[2419.72 → 2421.26] at cool temperatures
[2421.26 → 2422.42] and
[2422.42 → 2423.76] I usually actually like them
[2423.76 → 2424.48] without a GPU
[2424.48 → 2425.50] because I find GPU switching
[2425.50 → 2426.12] can be very
[2426.12 → 2427.40] kind of weird sometimes
[2427.40 → 2427.94] but yeah
[2427.94 → 2429.66] got it
[2429.66 → 2430.82] my bad
[2430.82 → 2431.72] that makes sense
[2431.72 → 2433.02] sorry for banging on the desk
[2433.02 → 2433.36] everyone
[2433.36 → 2434.48] um
[2434.48 → 2435.30] so yeah
[2435.30 → 2435.76] it's interesting
[2435.76 → 2436.76] but gaming laptops
[2436.76 → 2437.78] seem to be getting better lately
[2437.78 → 2439.50] so my opinion might change
[2439.50 → 2439.90] eventually
[2439.90 → 2440.34] we'll see
[2440.34 → 2441.32] I'm not rigid on that
[2441.32 → 2442.12] next up
[2442.12 → 2444.82] Moto 360 2015 edition
[2444.82 → 2445.92] um
[2445.92 → 2447.06] there was a hands-on
[2447.06 → 2448.08] from I believe
[2448.08 → 2448.98] Gizmodo
[2448.98 → 2450.90] so let me see
[2450.90 → 2451.66] if I can
[2451.66 → 2452.74] open this up
[2452.74 → 2453.76] Android Pit
[2453.76 → 2455.54] so I'm going to post that
[2455.54 → 2456.38] in the Twitch chat
[2456.38 → 2457.04] as well
[2457.04 → 2458.20] give me one quick second
[2458.20 → 2459.54] I closed it
[2459.54 → 2460.72] it's personally my
[2460.72 → 2462.04] and I'm not a big smartwatch guy
[2462.04 → 2462.72] um
[2462.72 → 2463.72] it's personally my favourite
[2463.72 → 2464.60] looking smartwatch
[2464.60 → 2465.44] cool
[2465.44 → 2466.86] I love the fact that it's round
[2466.86 → 2467.78] yeah
[2467.78 → 2468.68] that's not a new
[2468.68 → 2469.04] you know
[2469.04 → 2469.62] that was on their
[2469.62 → 2470.50] on their last watch
[2470.50 → 2471.64] but the fact that it's round
[2471.64 → 2472.46] it looks like a watch
[2472.46 → 2473.18] because to me
[2473.18 → 2474.62] a watch is still a style
[2474.62 → 2475.92] point
[2475.92 → 2476.96] like I understand
[2476.96 → 2477.70] they're building in
[2477.70 → 2478.40] all this technology
[2478.40 → 2479.66] you can look at your text message
[2479.66 → 2480.86] you can okay Google
[2480.86 → 2481.54] there are different things
[2481.54 → 2482.20] that you can do
[2482.20 → 2482.90] uh
[2482.90 → 2483.86] with the Apple Watch as well
[2483.86 → 2484.36] but to me
[2484.36 → 2485.54] it's still a style piece
[2485.54 → 2486.54] um
[2486.54 → 2487.04] and it's really
[2487.04 → 2488.30] it has to contribute
[2488.30 → 2489.72] to your outfit
[2489.72 → 2490.28] to your look
[2490.28 → 2491.00] it's got to look right
[2491.00 → 2491.40] in the mirror
[2491.40 → 2492.26] um
[2492.26 → 2492.92] or it's not going to work
[2492.92 → 2493.90] that's just my personal opinion
[2493.90 → 2494.80] I think the 360
[2494.80 → 2495.38] does a
[2495.38 → 2496.40] does the best job
[2496.40 → 2497.02] of it currently
[2497.02 → 2498.04] yeah
[2498.04 → 2499.46] so the basic model
[2499.46 → 2501.28] starts at 300 US dollars
[2501.28 → 2502.18] so like
[2502.18 → 2503.96] 8,000 Canadian dollars
[2503.96 → 2504.66] eight and a half
[2504.66 → 2505.20] yeah
[2505.20 → 2505.60] yeah
[2505.60 → 2506.10] and the
[2506.10 → 2507.66] the more expensive version
[2507.66 → 2508.26] which I don't know
[2508.26 → 2509.34] a ton about at this moment
[2509.34 → 2511.40] is 450 US dollars
[2511.40 → 2511.86] so about
[2511.86 → 2513.76] 16,000 Canadian dollars
[2513.76 → 2514.50] uh
[2514.50 → 2515.28] I'm kidding by the way
[2515.28 → 2515.88] the Canadian dollar
[2515.88 → 2516.72] just sucks right now
[2516.72 → 2517.54] so bad
[2517.54 → 2517.86] it's
[2517.86 → 2518.68] it's pretty rough
[2518.68 → 2519.22] um
[2519.22 → 2520.32] it comes in two sizes
[2520.32 → 2522.42] 46mm and 42mm
[2522.42 → 2523.70] um
[2523.70 → 2525.04] the idea is that
[2525.04 → 2525.98] Motorola can market
[2525.98 → 2527.32] the two different sizes
[2527.32 → 2528.52] to men or women
[2528.52 → 2529.24] uh
[2529.24 → 2529.48] women
[2529.48 → 2530.28] not woman
[2530.28 → 2531.76] they can market it to woman
[2531.76 → 2532.66] uh
[2532.66 → 2533.32] well I think they actually
[2533.32 → 2534.96] have two sizes for males
[2534.96 → 2535.88] like the small and the large
[2535.88 → 2536.56] and then they have
[2536.56 → 2537.60] a female version
[2537.60 → 2538.76] which is the small
[2538.76 → 2539.58] with a different band
[2539.58 → 2540.14] ah
[2540.14 → 2540.44] cool
[2540.44 → 2541.34] so that's kind of it
[2541.34 → 2541.70] sure
[2541.70 → 2542.30] um
[2542.30 → 2542.94] um
[2542.94 → 2543.60] although the bands
[2543.60 → 2544.94] I believe are interchangeable
[2544.94 → 2545.44] yeah
[2545.44 → 2546.26] interchangeable
[2546.26 → 2546.94] um
[2546.94 → 2547.40] where was it
[2547.40 → 2547.88] yeah right there
[2547.88 → 2548.48] you can see
[2548.48 → 2549.86] here we go
[2549.86 → 2550.22] the interchangeable band
[2550.22 → 2550.56] oh
[2550.56 → 2551.50] yes
[2551.50 → 2552.26] just right there
[2552.26 → 2553.46] that's the little mechanism
[2553.46 → 2554.76] that no one can see me
[2554.76 → 2555.42] pointing at
[2555.42 → 2555.96] but uh
[2555.96 → 2556.78] here I'll use the mouse
[2556.78 → 2557.16] wait
[2557.16 → 2557.68] wrong mouse
[2557.68 → 2558.38] uh
[2558.38 → 2558.92] yeah
[2558.92 → 2559.56] it's right there
[2559.56 → 2560.72] there you go
[2560.72 → 2561.24] um
[2561.24 → 2562.06] the display
[2562.06 → 2563.78] so it has a
[2563.78 → 2564.28] uh
[2564.28 → 2564.52] like
[2564.52 → 2565.56] like it said earlier
[2565.56 → 2566.48] the display comes in
[2566.48 → 2567.06] two different sizes
[2567.06 → 2568.26] 1.37 inch
[2568.26 → 2569.84] and 1.56 inch
[2569.84 → 2570.40] they're both
[2570.40 → 2571.40] LCD's
[2571.40 → 2572.10] they have resolutions
[2572.10 → 2574.22] of 360 by 325
[2574.22 → 2576.44] and 360 by 330
[2576.44 → 2577.70] so not a huge difference
[2577.70 → 2578.62] in the resolution actually
[2578.62 → 2579.86] um
[2579.86 → 2581.14] they moved the hardware button
[2581.14 → 2582.10] from the 3 o'clock position
[2582.10 → 2582.84] to the 2 o'clock
[2582.84 → 2583.76] I like that
[2583.76 → 2584.60] oh it's way better
[2584.60 → 2585.54] it's also uh
[2585.54 → 2586.52] I was reading that
[2586.52 → 2587.52] there were issues with people
[2587.52 → 2588.22] bending their wrist
[2588.22 → 2588.86] and it's getting
[2588.86 → 2589.82] poked into there
[2589.82 → 2590.66] that's that's a big problem
[2590.66 → 2591.54] most people wear their watches
[2591.54 → 2592.24] on their left hand
[2592.24 → 2593.10] they're going to have that
[2593.10 → 2594.64] button on the right-hand side
[2594.64 → 2596.26] it's its going to be an issue
[2596.26 → 2597.32] so it's its smart
[2597.32 → 2597.98] that they move that
[2597.98 → 2598.66] yes
[2598.66 → 2600.38] I do want to go to dinner tonight
[2600.38 → 2601.00] Alice Yang
[2601.00 → 2602.00] I'm hungry
[2602.00 → 2603.48] that would work for me
[2603.48 → 2604.28] I'm a little hungry
[2604.28 → 2605.22] let me know which restaurant
[2605.22 → 2606.30] I'll third wheel like crazy
[2606.30 → 2606.90] that works
[2606.90 → 2608.28] because it's not a date
[2608.28 → 2611.34] um
[2611.34 → 2612.30] I
[2612.30 → 2613.14] let's see here
[2613.14 → 2614.68] in terms of actual tech specs
[2614.68 → 2615.32] it
[2615.32 → 2616.28] it has
[2616.28 → 2616.98] the the the the the
[2616.98 → 2618.44] Snapdragon 400 processor
[2618.44 → 2620.56] running a frequency of 1.2 gigahertz
[2620.56 → 2622.48] 4 gigabytes of internal storage
[2622.48 → 2624.66] and 512 megabytes of RAM
[2624.66 → 2626.42] which is something I haven't said for a while
[2626.42 → 2629.02] I think that's in a very low amount of RAM
[2629.02 → 2631.76] we even like stopped iterating in that amount
[2631.76 → 2633.16] now it's like per gig
[2633.16 → 2634.62] instead of per half gig
[2634.62 → 2634.94] yeah
[2634.94 → 2635.78] anyway
[2635.78 → 2636.78] the good old days
[2636.78 → 2638.30] the 400 William battery
[2638.30 → 2640.24] obviously that's a small amount
[2640.24 → 2640.82] but you know
[2640.82 → 2641.70] you got to look at the draw
[2641.70 → 2642.90] not necessarily the capacity
[2642.90 → 2643.26] yeah
[2643.26 → 2645.68] but again that's the scary thing with smartwatches
[2645.68 → 2646.56] is the fact that
[2646.56 → 2647.64] they don't last a long time
[2647.64 → 2649.68] I think I would want to jump to the 46 millimetre
[2649.68 → 2651.02] even just for the battery
[2651.02 → 2651.30] yeah
[2651.30 → 2653.42] because the 42 millimetre watch
[2653.42 → 2654.92] has a 300 William hour battery
[2654.92 → 2656.34] and then the 46 millimetre watch
[2656.34 → 2657.98] has a 400 million battery
[2657.98 → 2658.62] large increase
[2658.62 → 2659.66] absolutely worth it alone
[2659.66 → 2660.50] then the like
[2660.50 → 2662.50] slightly higher PPI
[2662.50 → 2663.76] which is pretty
[2663.76 → 2665.04] actually lower PPI
[2665.04 → 2666.96] but slightly higher resolution
[2666.96 → 2669.00] so the PPI of the smaller one
[2669.00 → 2669.78] the 42 millimetre
[2669.78 → 2671.48] is 354
[2671.48 → 2673.92] and that's at a resolution of 360 by 325
[2673.92 → 2676.06] and the PPI of the slightly larger one
[2676.06 → 2677.42] the 46 millimetre one
[2677.42 → 2678.84] is 313
[2678.84 → 2679.86] so it's lower
[2679.86 → 2680.62] but
[2680.62 → 2683.14] has a slightly higher resolution of 360 by 330
[2683.14 → 2684.50] it's just a bigger screen
[2684.50 → 2685.34] yeah
[2685.34 → 2686.60] Android Wear
[2686.60 → 2689.18] as you all probably figured out automatically
[2689.18 → 2691.20] it has four cores running at that
[2691.20 → 2692.38] 1.2 gigahertz
[2692.38 → 2694.10] and Bluetooth 4.0
[2694.10 → 2694.72] so
[2694.72 → 2697.66] I'm sure Linus is going to end up reviewing this at some point
[2697.66 → 2698.34] so
[2698.34 → 2699.14] yeah that'd be awesome
[2699.14 → 2700.30] probably stay tuned
[2700.30 → 2701.62] to get their hands on one of those
[2701.62 → 2703.80] let me see here
[2703.80 → 2706.18] we could jump into the Samsung launches
[2706.18 → 2707.60] the
[2707.60 → 2709.32] oh you got something on mine don't you
[2709.32 → 2709.94] I do
[2709.94 → 2710.94] it's going to take me a second
[2710.94 → 2712.82] we have sponsor spots
[2712.82 → 2713.76] sponsor spots

[2777.90 → 2778.76] government jobs
[2778.76 → 2780.22] so he started doing uh
[2780.22 → 2781.36] recycling
[2781.36 → 2783.58] we'll keep this try to be somewhat non-specific
[2783.58 → 2785.46] but he's got a few hours at the end of the day
[2785.46 → 2786.44] which he wasn't sure how to fill
[2786.44 → 2787.00] and he was saying you know
[2787.00 → 2788.18] how could I make money
[2788.18 → 2788.96] he's trying to think of ideas
[2788.96 → 2789.28] and I was saying
[2789.28 → 2791.04] maybe instead of directly looking to make
[2791.04 → 2792.32] a financial
[2792.32 → 2793.56] you know gain
[2793.56 → 2794.20] in those few hours
[2794.20 → 2794.62] at the end of the day
[2794.62 → 2795.70] check out lynda.com
[2795.70 → 2796.46] maybe do a course
[2796.46 → 2796.94] or something like that
[2796.94 → 2798.02] he's actually signed up
[2798.02 → 2798.48] and doing it
[2798.48 → 2799.06] so uh
[2799.06 → 2799.66] that's awesome
[2799.66 → 2800.22] it's pretty cool
[2800.22 → 2800.98] you can fit it in there
[2800.98 → 2801.62] on your own time
[2801.62 → 2801.82] and
[2801.82 → 2802.88] well
[2802.88 → 2804.40] if what he learns
[2804.40 → 2805.72] needs a website

[2807.78 → 2808.78] c-c-combo
[2808.78 → 2810.00] go to squarespace.com

[2811.26 → 2812.12] to save 10%
[2812.12 → 2812.92] and you can make
[2812.92 → 2814.10] a beautiful website
[2814.10 → 2815.48] using one of their many templates
[2815.48 → 2815.76] they are
[2815.76 → 2816.84] it requires
[2816.84 → 2817.64] uh
[2817.64 → 2818.92] basically no skill level
[2818.92 → 2819.76] although if you do
[2819.76 → 2820.70] have a skill level
[2820.70 → 2821.44] at designing websites
[2821.44 → 2822.58] you can get down into
[2822.58 → 2823.46] some of the code
[2823.46 → 2824.70] and change how things look
[2824.70 → 2825.98] but you don't really need to
[2825.98 → 2826.54] they have a bunch
[2826.54 → 2827.16] of different templates
[2827.16 → 2828.72] you just kind of drop in text
[2828.72 → 2829.16] and images
[2829.16 → 2830.00] and then it just looks
[2830.00 → 2830.94] very nice and professional
[2830.94 → 2833.42] and can take a wave
[2833.42 → 2834.68] of WAN show people
[2834.68 → 2836.00] which is actually pretty intense
[2836.00 → 2836.32] it can
[2836.32 → 2837.82] we've used that multiple times
[2837.82 → 2838.68] uh
[2838.68 → 2839.40] let me see here
[2839.40 → 2840.40] one quick second
[2840.40 → 2841.56] there was a provider
[2841.56 → 2842.60] who uh
[2842.60 → 2843.72] wasn't able to
[2843.72 → 2844.76] I clicked the wrong
[2844.76 → 2845.76] what is happening
[2845.76 → 2846.52] do you see that
[2846.52 → 2848.26] the minimize and new tab
[2848.26 → 2849.08] button are covering
[2849.08 → 2849.54] each other
[2849.54 → 2850.32] so if I just do
[2850.32 → 2850.96] control T
[2850.96 → 2852.16] it'll work anyway
[2852.16 → 2853.48] keyboard shortcuts
[2853.48 → 2854.44] been working since
[2854.44 → 2855.28] 3.1
[2855.28 → 2856.54] well actually maybe
[2856.54 → 2857.10] not that shortcut
[2857.10 → 2857.66] specifically
[2857.66 → 2857.98] but
[2857.98 → 2859.88] give me a second
[2859.88 → 2862.62] do do
[2862.62 → 2863.24] do do do
[2863.24 → 2864.46] so if you guys go to
[2864.46 → 2866.24] KaliBagsOnline.com
[2866.24 → 2867.52] K-A-L-I
[2867.52 → 2869.78] BagsOnline.com
[2869.78 → 2870.62] you can see
[2870.62 → 2871.68] my mom's website
[2871.68 → 2872.46] she made that
[2872.46 → 2873.12] it's on Squarespace
[2873.12 → 2875.44] and it's awesome
[2875.44 → 2876.46] and she made
[2876.46 → 2877.32] the whole thing
[2877.32 → 2878.40] I helped her with like
[2878.40 → 2879.36] one random
[2879.36 → 2880.34] very small thing
[2880.34 → 2881.36] she made all the rest
[2881.36 → 2882.76] and she doesn't exactly
[2882.76 → 2883.46] have like
[2883.46 → 2884.82] education in creating
[2884.82 → 2885.18] websites
[2885.18 → 2885.44] no
[2885.44 → 2886.66] so there you go
[2886.66 → 2887.54] trusted by millions
[2887.54 → 2888.46] of people who
[2888.46 → 2890.22] sorry one second
[2890.22 → 2890.80] trusted by millions
[2890.80 → 2891.58] of people and
[2891.58 → 2892.08] some of the most
[2892.08 → 2892.76] respected brands
[2892.76 → 2893.14] around the world
[2893.14 → 2893.72] starts at just
[2893.72 → 2894.56] 8 bucks a month
[2894.56 → 2895.26] and you get a free
[2895.26 → 2896.22] domain if you sign up
[2896.22 → 2896.84] for a year
[2896.84 → 2897.86] I know
[2897.86 → 2898.64] it's a solid deal
[2898.64 → 2899.36] a certain
[2899.36 → 2900.52] employee
[2900.52 → 2901.52] at Linus Media Group
[2901.52 → 2902.92] had his fiancé
[2902.92 → 2904.80] start a website
[2904.80 → 2905.60] based on their
[2905.60 → 2906.68] wedding on
[2906.68 → 2907.02] Squarespace
[2907.02 → 2907.80] and I believe
[2907.80 → 2908.22] they got the
[2908.22 → 2908.82] domain for free
[2908.82 → 2909.14] through that
[2909.14 → 2909.70] I'm not entirely
[2909.70 → 2910.00] sure
[2910.00 → 2910.34] nice
[2910.34 → 2911.66] but that's all
[2911.66 → 2912.64] I'm going to say
[2912.64 → 2913.24] so
[2913.24 → 2913.84] that's it for now
[2913.84 → 2914.58] private matters
[2914.58 → 2914.96] anyway
[2914.96 → 2915.94] Squarespace
[2915.94 → 2916.96] build it beautiful

[2920.50 → 2921.26] 10%
[2921.26 → 2922.88] book
[2922.88 → 2924.28] yay
[2924.28 → 2926.38] back to topics
[2926.38 → 2927.56] let's do some
[2927.56 → 2928.64] rapid fire for a sec
[2928.64 → 2929.32] unless there was
[2929.32 → 2929.78] something you wanted
[2929.78 → 2930.14] to do
[2930.14 → 2931.10] there is
[2931.10 → 2931.58] but we can do it
[2931.58 → 2932.30] after rapid fire
[2932.30 → 2932.76] alright
[2932.76 → 2933.32] mini news
[2933.32 → 2934.52] google new logo
[2934.52 → 2936.38] how much has this
[2936.38 → 2937.02] tripped you out
[2937.02 → 2938.98] I was wondering
[2938.98 → 2939.32] what you were gonna
[2939.32 → 2939.84] say about it
[2939.84 → 2940.30] because
[2940.30 → 2941.90] I don't really like it
[2941.90 → 2942.46] it doesn't really
[2942.46 → 2942.90] matter
[2942.90 → 2943.40] no
[2943.40 → 2943.80] no
[2943.80 → 2944.08] well
[2944.08 → 2944.98] like I don't
[2944.98 → 2945.48] really like it
[2945.48 → 2946.28] but I also say that
[2946.28 → 2946.96] with not really
[2946.96 → 2947.38] caring
[2947.38 → 2948.12] because
[2948.12 → 2949.78] why
[2949.78 → 2950.34] I don't
[2950.34 → 2950.80] you know what I mean
[2950.80 → 2951.64] I'm not a huge fan
[2951.64 → 2952.24] but again
[2952.24 → 2953.26] I don't
[2953.26 → 2954.38] I don't care about
[2954.38 → 2955.34] any of it
[2955.34 → 2956.60] especially the large logo
[2956.60 → 2957.78] what I do care about
[2957.78 → 2958.70] is the
[2958.70 → 2960.66] why can't I think
[2960.66 → 2961.04] of the name
[2961.04 → 2961.54] of it right now
[2961.54 → 2961.90] but the
[2961.90 → 2963.24] small little icon
[2963.24 → 2964.88] that goes on your tabs
[2964.88 → 2965.80] oh yeah
[2965.80 → 2967.02] because it's just
[2967.02 → 2967.52] tripping me out
[2967.52 → 2968.38] because I'm not used to it
[2968.38 → 2968.62] yeah
[2968.62 → 2969.22] so I'm like
[2969.22 → 2970.46] where's that tab
[2970.46 → 2971.30] and I can't find it
[2971.30 → 2972.08] because the little icon
[2972.08 → 2972.40] is different
[2972.40 → 2973.12] favicon
[2973.12 → 2974.72] I might be pronouncing
[2974.72 → 2975.16] that incorrectly
[2975.16 → 2976.60] but the favicon image
[2976.60 → 2977.84] is just driving me nuts
[2977.84 → 2978.44] other than that
[2978.44 → 2979.54] I don't care at all
[2979.54 → 2981.74] I use Google Maps
[2981.74 → 2982.52] constantly on my phone
[2982.52 → 2982.84] at work
[2982.84 → 2983.42] and they changed
[2983.42 → 2984.12] a bunch of the icons
[2984.12 → 2985.22] so I get the same feeling
[2985.22 → 2985.52] right
[2985.52 → 2985.82] yeah
[2985.82 → 2987.16] you don't look right
[2987.16 → 2987.74] what is that
[2987.74 → 2988.96] I'm looking for the thing
[2988.96 → 2989.44] that I know
[2989.44 → 2990.68] so what you're seeing here
[2990.68 → 2992.34] is I believe a GIF
[2992.34 → 2993.16] yeah
[2993.16 → 2993.72] of
[2993.72 → 2995.26] that little thing right there
[2995.26 → 2996.38] is what usually gets placed
[2996.38 → 2997.10] as the favicon
[2997.10 → 2998.48] and they just kind of show
[2998.48 → 2999.18] the other things
[2999.18 → 3000.44] that the logo could be used as
[3000.44 → 3001.34] because it's morphing
[3001.34 → 3002.62] into their other logos
[3002.62 → 3003.66] it's a cute little animation
[3003.66 → 3004.30] I like it
[3004.30 → 3004.56] yeah
[3004.56 → 3005.10] it works
[3005.10 → 3005.74] it works
[3005.74 → 3006.78] so yeah
[3006.78 → 3007.52] they changed the logo
[3007.52 → 3008.96] they were recently acquired
[3008.96 → 3009.74] by themselves
[3009.74 → 3011.04] under a company
[3011.04 → 3011.74] called Alphabet
[3011.74 → 3013.74] things are changing
[3013.74 → 3014.56] none of it
[3014.56 → 3015.26] in my opinion
[3015.26 → 3016.92] is really all that important
[3016.92 → 3017.80] they also mentioned
[3017.80 → 3018.92] that it might look better
[3018.92 → 3019.86] on smaller screens
[3019.86 → 3020.82] since everything's trying
[3020.82 → 3021.82] to go multi-platform
[3021.82 → 3023.14] and because smaller screens
[3023.14 → 3024.64] are becoming absolutely the norm
[3024.64 → 3026.14] so there's a hint
[3026.14 → 3026.80] that that might be
[3026.80 → 3028.12] kind of the reason why
[3028.12 → 3028.42] interesting
[3028.42 → 3029.00] yeah
[3029.00 → 3030.02] some of it was also
[3030.02 → 3031.36] because it more closely
[3031.36 → 3032.28] resembles the logo
[3032.28 → 3032.82] of Alphabet
[3032.82 → 3034.14] which is that parent company
[3034.14 → 3034.74] I just mentioned
[3034.74 → 3035.56] it's supposed to look
[3035.56 → 3037.04] more modern and playful
[3037.04 → 3039.28] I don't know anyone
[3039.28 → 3039.84] who does kind of
[3039.84 → 3040.62] the playful look
[3040.62 → 3042.12] as well as Google does
[3042.12 → 3042.68] I thought they were
[3042.68 → 3043.58] very modern and playful
[3043.58 → 3043.96] before
[3043.96 → 3044.72] already yeah
[3044.72 → 3046.50] but I don't know
[3046.50 → 3047.42] what else can you say
[3047.42 → 3049.10] about a small font change
[3049.10 → 3050.06] not much
[3050.06 → 3051.46] we'll get through this
[3051.46 → 3052.18] if you don't like it
[3052.18 → 3053.04] it'll be okay
[3053.04 → 3054.44] yeah I don't know
[3054.44 → 3055.48] it's just
[3055.48 → 3056.78] it's really
[3056.78 → 3058.42] it's really not that big of a deal
[3058.42 → 3059.64] I saw a few people
[3059.64 → 3061.00] very small amount of people
[3061.00 → 3061.56] freaking out
[3061.56 → 3062.50] but I think most people
[3062.50 → 3063.20] kind of generally
[3063.20 → 3064.40] agree with us
[3064.40 → 3064.96] let's see what the
[3064.96 → 3065.60] Twitch chat says
[3065.60 → 3066.92] let's do a straw poll actually
[3066.92 → 3068.04] so give me a second
[3068.04 → 3068.88] to make this straw poll
[3068.88 → 3069.04] oh man
[3069.04 → 3069.96] turn up
[3069.96 → 3072.26] I'm borrowing
[3072.26 → 3073.78] John
[3073.78 → 3075.28] our resident
[3075.28 → 3076.32] American's
[3076.32 → 3077.50] laptop
[3077.50 → 3078.18] for this
[3078.18 → 3078.94] so you can see
[3078.94 → 3079.96] I'm going to move
[3079.96 → 3081.90] us out of that corner
[3081.90 → 3083.20] you can see
[3083.20 → 3084.48] just how awesome
[3084.48 → 3085.96] this desktop is
[3085.96 → 3086.82] I don't know
[3086.82 → 3087.68] if he made this
[3087.68 → 3088.78] or if he found this
[3088.78 → 3090.44] but either way
[3090.44 → 3092.78] it's just great
[3092.78 → 3093.48] so I'm going to start
[3093.48 → 3094.18] a straw poll
[3094.18 → 3095.84] while you guys
[3095.84 → 3096.76] hopefully talk about
[3096.76 → 3098.50] that amazing background
[3098.50 → 3099.86] it's pretty epic
[3099.86 → 3101.66] the double down
[3101.66 → 3102.94] the double down
[3102.94 → 3103.48] the double down is awesome
[3103.48 → 3104.60] I think John's laughing
[3104.60 → 3105.54] back there now
[3105.54 → 3109.76] give me one second
[3109.76 → 3110.32] sorry guys
[3110.32 → 3112.28] so type your question here
[3112.28 → 3112.96] what was it again
[3112.96 → 3116.00] what do you think
[3116.00 → 3117.48] you think
[3117.48 → 3119.74] of the new
[3119.74 → 3120.96] I'll just show you guys
[3120.96 → 3121.44] what I'm doing
[3121.44 → 3123.34] Google logo
[3123.34 → 3125.24] oh my god
[3125.24 → 3126.50] I hate it
[3126.50 → 3128.50] so much
[3128.50 → 3129.50] I spelled much
[3129.50 → 3129.94] incorrectly
[3129.94 → 3131.08] but it kind of goes
[3131.08 → 3132.20] with how it works
[3132.20 → 3133.82] a wild Nick
[3133.82 → 3134.26] has appeared
[3134.26 → 3134.72] hi Nick
[3134.72 → 3136.04] what's wrong Nick
[3136.04 → 3137.24] okay
[3137.24 → 3143.38] I saw your giant
[3143.38 → 3144.14] full caps
[3144.14 → 3144.82] note on that
[3144.82 → 3145.78] we're good
[3145.78 → 3147.02] thanks bro
[3147.02 → 3151.96] I don't even know
[3151.96 → 3152.64] okay
[3152.64 → 3153.24] we'll see
[3153.24 → 3155.16] turnip
[3155.16 → 3156.06] I'm not going to learn
[3156.06 → 3157.12] what it's about right now
[3157.12 → 3157.60] yeah
[3157.60 → 3158.88] do that while I do this
[3158.88 → 3160.80] oh my god
[3160.80 → 3161.42] I hate it so much
[3161.42 → 3162.24] I don't care
[3162.24 → 3163.32] turnip
[3163.32 → 3165.88] I don't really care
[3165.88 → 3166.48] much
[3166.48 → 3167.64] but it's
[3167.64 → 3168.64] confusing
[3168.64 → 3170.70] sometimes
[3170.70 → 3171.30] cool
[3171.30 → 3172.32] do you have like
[3172.32 → 3173.18] an like it option
[3173.18 → 3179.08] there we go
[3179.08 → 3180.40] thanks
[3180.40 → 3181.68] okay cool
[3181.68 → 3182.40] there's no positive
[3182.40 → 3184.40] we will do
[3184.40 → 3185.60] permissive
[3185.60 → 3186.52] and then that's it
[3186.52 → 3187.30] so create
[3187.30 → 3187.70] poll
[3187.70 → 3189.12] give me a quick second
[3189.12 → 3190.22] my prediction
[3190.22 → 3191.24] is
[3191.24 → 3191.60] turnip
[3191.60 → 3192.92] yeah
[3192.92 → 3193.54] you think turnip
[3193.54 → 3193.78] is going to
[3193.78 → 3194.28] straight up win
[3194.28 → 3195.18] well that's
[3195.18 → 3195.70] pretty awesome
[3195.70 → 3196.18] when turnip
[3196.18 → 3196.80] straight up wins
[3196.80 → 3197.78] I have to say
[3197.78 → 3198.50] I have occasionally
[3198.50 → 3199.36] voted for turnip
[3199.36 → 3200.46] every time
[3200.46 → 3202.30] I have occasionally
[3202.30 → 3203.18] done this literally
[3203.18 → 3203.82] all the time
[3203.82 → 3204.18] forever
[3204.18 → 3206.22] I like it
[3206.22 → 3206.96] wow there's a lot
[3206.96 → 3207.34] of I like
[3207.34 → 3208.04] oh turnip
[3208.04 → 3209.64] oh jeez
[3209.64 → 3210.68] turnip's kind of
[3210.68 → 3211.40] running away with it
[3211.40 → 3211.86] all of a sudden
[3211.86 → 3213.08] I'm hoping I like it
[3213.08 → 3213.40] wins
[3213.40 → 3214.28] actually I kind of
[3214.28 → 3214.92] want turnip to win
[3214.92 → 3215.30] because it makes
[3215.30 → 3216.10] Linus a little mad
[3216.10 → 3216.78] yeah
[3216.78 → 3217.08] so
[3217.08 → 3218.50] I kind of vote
[3218.50 → 3218.86] for turnip
[3218.86 → 3219.68] that's always
[3219.68 → 3220.16] entertaining
[3220.16 → 3220.68] sorry
[3220.68 → 3221.96] I'm actually
[3221.96 → 3223.06] part of team
[3223.06 → 3223.64] number three
[3223.64 → 3224.32] I guess at this
[3224.32 → 3224.60] point
[3224.60 → 3226.16] which does I don't
[3226.16 → 3226.72] really care
[3226.72 → 3227.40] but it's confusing
[3227.40 → 3228.04] sometimes
[3228.04 → 3228.88] yes my honest
[3228.88 → 3229.66] answer would be
[3229.66 → 3230.14] I don't
[3230.14 → 3231.34] dislike it
[3231.34 → 3232.50] so I would be
[3232.50 → 3233.38] down with saying
[3233.38 → 3234.12] that I like it
[3234.12 → 3235.56] it looks nice
[3235.56 → 3236.20] I don't really
[3236.20 → 3236.56] care
[3236.56 → 3237.36] I just yeah
[3237.36 → 3238.06] I'm a part of
[3238.06 → 3238.46] number three
[3238.46 → 3239.72] I don't fully
[3239.72 → 3240.42] understand the
[3240.42 → 3241.10] oh my god I hate
[3241.10 → 3241.52] it so much
[3241.52 → 3241.82] crowd
[3241.82 → 3244.02] but if someone's
[3244.02 → 3244.56] like resistant
[3244.56 → 3245.14] to change
[3245.14 → 3245.48] and they use
[3245.48 → 3246.00] google a lot
[3246.00 → 3246.94] I guess I get it
[3246.94 → 3247.98] it is the smallest
[3247.98 → 3249.14] it is heavily
[3249.14 → 3250.04] losing at this point
[3250.04 → 3250.50] it is
[3250.50 → 3251.32] turnip is just
[3251.32 → 3251.96] wrecking
[3251.96 → 3253.28] just destroying
[3253.28 → 3254.52] turnip
[3254.52 → 3256.38] 16% above
[3256.38 → 3257.44] the closest
[3257.44 → 3258.94] other vote
[3258.94 → 3259.48] so that's
[3259.48 → 3260.32] pretty cool
[3260.32 → 3260.90] so our first
[3260.90 → 3261.44] real answer
[3261.44 → 3262.12] is I like it
[3262.12 → 3262.42] so that's
[3262.42 → 3262.88] kind of cool
[3262.88 → 3263.18] yes
[3263.18 → 3263.72] I like it's
[3263.72 → 3263.92] winning
[3263.92 → 3264.86] do you want to
[3264.86 → 3265.22] keep reading
[3265.22 → 3265.74] that thing
[3265.74 → 3266.58] yes
[3266.58 → 3267.32] so I'm going to
[3267.32 → 3268.00] actually jump down
[3268.00 → 3268.76] and do a rapid fire
[3268.76 → 3269.52] topic by myself
[3269.52 → 3270.10] and then hopefully
[3270.10 → 3271.50] you can help fill us
[3271.50 → 3272.58] in on whatever
[3272.58 → 3273.28] that is that you're
[3273.28 → 3273.84] actually reading
[3273.84 → 3275.58] so the ASUS
[3275.58 → 3277.48] Matrix GTX 980Ti
[3277.48 → 3278.24] Platinum
[3278.24 → 3279.92] is being shown
[3279.92 → 3280.38] off
[3280.38 → 3282.10] I'll try to
[3282.10 → 3283.00] get to the actual
[3283.00 → 3283.76] thread but the
[3283.76 → 3284.50] actual thread wasn't
[3284.50 → 3285.12] really linked
[3285.12 → 3285.58] so it's going to
[3285.58 → 3286.36] take me a quick
[3286.36 → 3286.74] second
[3286.74 → 3288.16] it looks freaking
[3288.16 → 3288.62] sick
[3288.62 → 3289.24] I can tell you
[3289.24 → 3289.72] that much
[3289.72 → 3290.76] but you might
[3290.76 → 3291.42] have a little bit
[3291.42 → 3292.04] of trouble having
[3292.04 → 3292.60] it matches your
[3292.60 → 3293.26] motherboard unless
[3293.26 → 3294.20] you have the
[3294.20 → 3295.08] exact motherboard
[3295.08 → 3295.84] that goes with it
[3295.84 → 3296.96] which if you're
[3296.96 → 3297.94] spending that much
[3297.94 → 3298.50] money on it
[3298.50 → 3299.94] it's probably
[3299.94 → 3300.68] not that unlikely
[3300.68 → 3301.74] so it's probably
[3301.74 → 3302.14] okay
[3302.14 → 3303.20] hopefully this press
[3303.20 → 3303.76] release actually
[3303.76 → 3304.30] has pictures
[3304.30 → 3305.38] this press release
[3305.38 → 3305.92] does not have
[3305.92 → 3306.30] pictures
[3306.30 → 3307.62] I don't think
[3307.62 → 3308.24] so we're actually
[3308.24 → 3308.60] just going to
[3308.60 → 3309.00] show off the
[3309.00 → 3309.54] Linus Tech Tips
[3309.54 → 3310.64] topic which I
[3310.64 → 3311.70] will link you guys
[3311.70 → 3312.82] in a moment here
[3312.82 → 3313.70] I say this every
[3313.70 → 3314.24] time I'm on the
[3314.24 → 3314.88] show but your
[3314.88 → 3315.66] forum is awesome
[3315.66 → 3316.72] when I was looking
[3316.72 → 3317.04] through the
[3317.04 → 3318.26] documentation or the
[3318.26 → 3319.32] doc I should say
[3319.32 → 3320.00] before the show
[3320.00 → 3321.68] there's a link to
[3321.68 → 3322.52] a Linus Tech Tips
[3322.52 → 3323.58] forum post for
[3323.58 → 3324.36] every single topic
[3324.36 → 3325.04] we're talking about
[3325.04 → 3326.58] you guys are awesome
[3326.58 → 3327.30] you contribute very
[3327.30 → 3327.50] well
[3327.50 → 3329.24] the tech news and
[3329.24 → 3330.48] reviews is like
[3330.48 → 3331.82] one of the most
[3331.82 → 3332.66] insane forum
[3332.66 → 3333.58] sections I've seen
[3333.58 → 3334.16] on any forum
[3334.16 → 3334.44] ever
[3334.44 → 3335.50] they're so on top
[3335.50 → 3335.88] of things
[3335.88 → 3336.52] because people are
[3336.52 → 3337.34] so aggressive about
[3337.34 → 3337.92] wanting to be the
[3337.92 → 3338.48] first one
[3338.48 → 3339.80] and people are so
[3339.80 → 3340.52] good at formatting
[3340.52 → 3341.54] it's a beautiful
[3341.54 → 3341.98] look
[3341.98 → 3343.22] it's like you make
[3343.22 → 3343.72] your forum on
[3343.72 → 3344.18] Squarespace
[3344.18 → 3349.18] we're working on
[3349.18 → 3349.84] that actually for
[3349.84 → 3350.72] the next version of
[3350.72 → 3351.46] the forum which is
[3351.46 → 3352.14] in development right
[3352.14 → 3352.50] now
[3352.50 → 3353.92] Envision Power board
[3353.92 → 3355.62] or Envision Power
[3355.62 → 3357.42] whatever
[3357.42 → 3359.42] is the software
[3359.42 → 3360.06] that we use
[3360.06 → 3360.62] and they released
[3360.62 → 3361.32] their new version
[3361.32 → 3361.82] but we're going to
[3361.82 → 3363.30] be heavily modifying
[3363.30 → 3364.42] it adding in a
[3364.42 → 3365.20] really cool new
[3365.20 → 3366.04] text editor thing
[3366.04 → 3366.48] that we're doing
[3366.48 → 3367.46] tons of work on
[3367.46 → 3368.28] and a bunch
[3368.28 → 3368.70] of other stuff
[3368.70 → 3369.24] so it should be
[3369.24 → 3369.90] actually a really
[3369.90 → 3370.60] big upgrade
[3370.60 → 3371.16] we're going to be
[3371.16 → 3371.72] ramping up
[3371.72 → 3372.56] classifieds
[3372.56 → 3373.20] so classifieds
[3373.20 → 3373.70] should be a lot
[3373.70 → 3374.00] cooler
[3374.00 → 3374.62] there's going to
[3374.62 → 3375.12] be way more
[3375.12 → 3375.66] functionality
[3375.66 → 3376.00] we're going to
[3376.00 → 3376.48] be implementing
[3376.48 → 3377.12] a lot of that
[3377.12 → 3378.24] stuff that's been
[3378.24 → 3378.82] in the thread
[3378.82 → 3379.32] forever
[3379.32 → 3380.18] that people are
[3380.18 → 3380.80] like can we do
[3380.80 → 3381.34] this, and we're
[3381.34 → 3382.56] like maybe in the
[3382.56 → 3383.14] next version
[3383.14 → 3384.04] so we've been
[3384.04 → 3384.56] working on a lot
[3384.56 → 3385.06] of that stuff
[3385.06 → 3385.74] hopefully you guys
[3385.74 → 3386.10] like it
[3386.10 → 3387.54] but that's months
[3387.54 → 3388.08] out
[3388.08 → 3388.88] I probably shouldn't
[3388.88 → 3389.54] even have
[3389.54 → 3390.02] teased it
[3390.02 → 3391.36] so I'm just
[3391.36 → 3391.84] excited
[3391.84 → 3392.80] whatever
[3392.80 → 3393.58] anyway
[3393.58 → 3394.10] well I know you
[3394.10 → 3394.60] put an absolute
[3394.60 → 3395.34] ton of work into
[3395.34 → 3396.20] the first version
[3396.20 → 3396.66] of the forum
[3396.66 → 3398.00] I remember going
[3398.00 → 3398.78] over to your place
[3398.78 → 3399.30] and you look like
[3399.30 → 3400.14] an absolute zombie
[3400.14 → 3401.40] and there was a ton
[3401.40 → 3401.96] of work and I
[3401.96 → 3402.42] think that's when
[3402.42 → 3403.34] Mr. Wizard was
[3403.34 → 3404.98] helping out as well
[3404.98 → 3406.30] this time we've got
[3406.30 → 3407.36] a pretty big crew
[3407.36 → 3408.76] we've got Kat on
[3408.76 → 3409.80] the forum is helping
[3409.80 → 3411.68] Colonel Morris is
[3411.68 → 3412.38] helping a lot
[3412.38 → 3413.36] Mr. Wizard is
[3413.36 → 3414.06] helping again
[3414.06 → 3414.90] I'm doing some
[3414.90 → 3415.24] stuff
[3415.24 → 3415.96] probably not as
[3415.96 → 3416.50] much as I should
[3416.50 → 3416.80] be
[3416.80 → 3418.66] but yeah there's a
[3418.66 → 3419.72] big crew helping
[3419.72 → 3420.90] and then once we
[3420.90 → 3421.64] start testing it
[3421.64 → 3422.00] I'm going to be
[3422.00 → 3423.04] using all the mods
[3423.04 → 3423.66] and probably a bunch
[3423.66 → 3424.22] of Linus Media Group
[3424.22 → 3424.92] employees to like
[3424.92 → 3425.70] test out the website
[3425.70 → 3426.58] find all the bugs
[3426.58 → 3427.30] that we can
[3427.30 → 3428.38] try to fix what we
[3428.38 → 3429.38] can, and then we'll
[3429.38 → 3429.98] go from there
[3429.98 → 3430.74] but anyway
[3430.74 → 3431.82] jumping back to it
[3431.82 → 3434.44] the 980 Ti
[3434.44 → 3435.34] platinum card
[3435.34 → 3436.06] you can see
[3436.06 → 3437.18] why I might have
[3437.18 → 3437.94] said it might be a
[3437.94 → 3438.80] little bit rough to
[3438.80 → 3439.40] match with certain
[3439.40 → 3440.52] systems but then
[3440.52 → 3441.24] again if I scroll
[3441.24 → 3442.08] down you can see the
[3442.08 → 3442.84] motherboard that goes
[3442.84 → 3443.68] with it and that
[3443.68 → 3445.38] thing matches it
[3445.38 → 3446.60] very well
[3446.60 → 3447.12] it looks sick
[3447.12 → 3448.24] so if you want to
[3448.24 → 3449.02] get both that'll
[3449.02 → 3449.80] look super badass
[3449.80 → 3450.90] and if you don't it
[3450.90 → 3451.58] might be a little bit
[3451.58 → 3452.44] rough matching things
[3452.44 → 3453.30] but you'll be okay
[3453.30 → 3454.26] you'll be fine
[3454.26 → 3456.18] could do a Linus Media
[3456.18 → 3456.66] Group build
[3456.66 → 3457.62] with those parts
[3457.62 → 3458.44] oh my god
[3458.44 → 3460.36] the orange is
[3460.36 → 3461.00] slightly wrong
[3461.00 → 3461.34] I think
[3461.34 → 3462.10] but that's all
[3462.10 → 3462.96] a lot of that's
[3462.96 → 3463.76] glowing area
[3463.76 → 3467.00] maybe I'll talk to
[3467.00 → 3467.22] them
[3467.22 → 3468.04] it looks pretty cool
[3468.04 → 3468.68] it looks pretty cool
[3468.68 → 3469.12] I like it
[3469.12 → 3470.88] doing a Linus Media
[3470.88 → 3471.40] Group build
[3471.40 → 3472.22] like black and
[3472.22 → 3473.10] orange in general
[3473.10 → 3473.80] I don't even think
[3473.80 → 3474.38] we've done that
[3474.38 → 3475.08] and that's a pretty
[3475.08 → 3475.48] good idea
[3475.48 → 3475.78] I don't think
[3475.78 → 3476.22] there's a lot
[3476.22 → 3477.08] of options unless
[3477.08 → 3477.92] you were customizing
[3477.92 → 3478.54] no we'd probably
[3478.54 → 3479.22] have to yeah
[3479.22 → 3480.00] but that's fine
[3480.00 → 3481.08] once this works
[3481.08 → 3481.64] that makes it more
[3481.64 → 3481.82] original
[3481.82 → 3482.80] which is right here
[3482.80 → 3483.38] and you guys
[3483.38 → 3484.04] can't see it
[3484.04 → 3484.60] is done
[3484.60 → 3485.98] we might be able
[3485.98 → 3486.04] to do that
[3486.04 → 3486.38] you mean that
[3486.38 → 3487.18] beautifully organized
[3487.18 → 3488.06] area of perfection
[3488.06 → 3489.98] he lies
[3489.98 → 3491.88] deceit and lies
[3491.88 → 3493.26] anyway jumping to
[3493.26 → 3494.04] the topic that I
[3494.04 → 3494.64] don't even know
[3494.64 → 3495.28] what it is
[3495.28 → 3495.96] we're going to have to
[3495.96 → 3496.40] work through this
[3496.40 → 3496.74] together
[3496.74 → 3497.86] because I've been
[3497.86 → 3498.58] reading it and it
[3498.58 → 3499.64] is a lot of
[3499.64 → 3500.10] information
[3500.10 → 3501.82] but it does look
[3501.82 → 3502.44] pretty interesting
[3502.44 → 3504.28] ashes of singularity
[3504.28 → 3505.02] demo was showing
[3505.02 → 3505.98] better performance in
[3505.98 → 3507.34] DX12 on AMD
[3507.34 → 3508.30] cards than Nvidia
[3508.30 → 3509.30] yes okay
[3509.30 → 3510.82] I haven't read about
[3510.82 → 3511.54] this enough
[3511.54 → 3512.78] but I've read
[3512.78 → 3513.48] about it a little
[3513.48 → 3514.40] bit, so this is a
[3514.40 → 3515.40] massive topic
[3515.40 → 3516.54] Nick has been
[3516.54 → 3517.02] working on the
[3517.02 → 3517.76] notes for it
[3517.76 → 3519.40] like up there
[3519.40 → 3520.58] during the show
[3520.58 → 3521.66] I read something
[3521.66 → 3522.84] about it like
[3522.84 → 3524.02] right before the
[3524.02 → 3524.58] show started
[3524.58 → 3525.32] I wish I knew
[3525.32 → 3526.20] more about it
[3526.20 → 3528.12] there's actually
[3528.12 → 3528.68] a really good
[3528.68 → 3529.30] thread about it
[3529.30 → 3530.72] on overclock.net
[3530.72 → 3532.06] technically they're
[3532.06 → 3532.74] a competitor to
[3532.74 → 3533.22] our forum
[3533.22 → 3535.02] but I really like
[3535.02 → 3535.64] those guys
[3535.64 → 3536.36] and I've got
[3536.36 → 3536.96] buddies that have
[3536.96 → 3537.22] been in the
[3537.22 → 3537.84] computer thing for
[3537.84 → 3538.32] a long time
[3538.32 → 3538.66] they're like
[3538.66 → 3539.80] man I really want
[3539.80 → 3540.26] to join last
[3540.26 → 3540.98] text, but I have
[3540.98 → 3541.64] friends on
[3541.64 → 3542.30] overclock.net
[3542.30 → 3543.32] that I talk to
[3543.32 → 3545.26] all the time
[3545.26 → 3545.80] for years
[3545.80 → 3546.54] I'm like you
[3546.54 → 3546.72] know what
[3546.72 → 3547.20] that's cool
[3547.20 → 3548.20] just chill out
[3548.20 → 3548.46] there
[3548.46 → 3548.96] it's cool
[3548.96 → 3549.52] so we're not
[3549.52 → 3550.22] enemies
[3550.22 → 3551.38] we're cool
[3551.38 → 3552.22] overclock.net's
[3552.22 → 3552.50] cool
[3552.50 → 3553.88] so yes
[3553.88 → 3555.02] ashes of singularity
[3555.02 → 3557.78] the oxide developer
[3557.78 → 3558.44] collar
[3558.44 → 3559.62] had a very lengthy
[3559.62 → 3560.68] response on the
[3560.68 → 3561.60] overclock.net forum
[3561.60 → 3562.68] so that's what I
[3562.68 → 3563.52] linked I believe
[3563.52 → 3564.36] yes that should
[3564.36 → 3564.98] bring you right
[3564.98 → 3565.92] to the right post
[3565.92 → 3566.76] so that's actually
[3566.76 → 3567.54] from the developer
[3567.54 → 3568.14] he only has
[3568.14 → 3568.94] four posts
[3568.94 → 3571.62] but after
[3571.62 → 3572.36] seeing this post
[3572.36 → 3573.08] it looks like
[3573.08 → 3573.50] he made them
[3573.50 → 3573.86] count
[3573.86 → 3574.74] I'll show you
[3574.74 → 3575.32] yeah definitely
[3575.32 → 3576.64] so yeah he
[3576.64 → 3577.44] went ham
[3577.44 → 3579.44] not technically
[3579.44 → 3580.16] wall of text
[3580.16 → 3581.00] because he pressed
[3581.00 → 3582.04] sometimes enter
[3582.04 → 3584.16] but it's a lot
[3584.16 → 3584.60] of text
[3584.60 → 3586.68] so basically
[3586.68 → 3587.48] I think
[3587.48 → 3589.14] what happened
[3589.14 → 3589.96] was that AMD
[3589.96 → 3590.80] cards did perform
[3590.80 → 3591.96] better on DX12
[3591.96 → 3593.28] yeah ashes
[3593.28 → 3594.06] singularity demo
[3594.06 → 3594.62] was showing better
[3594.62 → 3595.58] performance in DX12
[3595.58 → 3596.52] on AMD cards
[3596.52 → 3597.48] and Nvidia cards
[3597.48 → 3599.64] if ashes is biased
[3599.64 → 3600.30] then any
[3600.30 → 3601.20] Unreal 4 game
[3601.20 → 3602.06] must be Nvidia
[3602.06 → 3603.34] biased as well
[3603.34 → 3603.78] yeah
[3603.78 → 3605.28] interesting
[3605.28 → 3606.02] using the nitrous
[3606.02 → 3606.38] engine
[3606.38 → 3606.84] yeah
[3606.84 → 3609.70] Nvidia DX11
[3609.70 → 3610.54] performance has
[3610.54 → 3611.32] increased over the
[3611.32 → 3612.34] past few months
[3612.34 → 3613.74] DX12 overhead
[3613.74 → 3614.64] is still better
[3614.64 → 3615.16] for Nvidia
[3615.16 → 3615.80] than it was
[3615.80 → 3617.02] on DX11
[3617.02 → 3618.00] and has not
[3618.00 → 3618.46] been fully
[3618.46 → 3618.94] tweaked
[3618.94 → 3619.64] yet
[3619.64 → 3620.72] this is actually
[3620.72 → 3621.40] pretty nuts
[3621.40 → 3622.12] people are
[3622.12 → 3624.24] are up in arms
[3624.24 → 3624.80] about this
[3624.80 → 3625.74] I got a few messages
[3625.74 → 3626.62] right before the show
[3626.62 → 3627.38] but wasn't entirely
[3627.38 → 3628.24] sure what it was about
[3628.24 → 3629.34] sorry that we're not
[3629.34 → 3629.92] fully up to date
[3629.92 → 3630.42] on this topic
[3630.42 → 3632.06] this is like live news
[3632.06 → 3633.20] it literally came in
[3633.20 → 3634.28] as the show was going
[3634.28 → 3634.76] it literally
[3634.76 → 3635.72] Nick ran down here
[3635.72 → 3635.96] it's like
[3635.96 → 3636.84] I'm done
[3636.84 → 3637.86] it's ready
[3637.86 → 3639.08] and it is about
[3639.08 → 3640.04] a full page on here
[3640.04 → 3641.72] so good job Nick
[3641.72 → 3642.46] right now
[3642.46 → 3644.10] this is a quote
[3644.10 → 3645.26] let me see if I can
[3645.26 → 3646.40] even see who it's from
[3646.40 → 3648.76] nope
[3648.76 → 3649.88] but probably the dude
[3649.88 → 3650.80] that made that post
[3650.80 → 3651.56] so we're going to go
[3651.56 → 3651.92] with that
[3651.92 → 3652.58] right now
[3652.58 → 3653.20] I estimate about
[3653.20 → 3654.40] 20% of our graphics
[3654.40 → 3655.30] pipeline occurs
[3655.30 → 3656.64] in compute shaders
[3656.64 → 3657.92] and we are projecting
[3657.92 → 3658.38] that
[3658.38 → 3659.40] we're projecting
[3659.40 → 3660.04] this to be
[3660.04 → 3661.14] more than 50%
[3661.14 → 3662.18] on the next iteration
[3662.18 → 3662.94] of our engine
[3662.94 → 3663.78] in fact
[3663.78 → 3664.96] it is even conceivable
[3664.96 → 3665.62] to build
[3665.62 → 3666.70] a rendering pipeline
[3666.70 → 3668.50] entirely in compute shaders
[3668.50 → 3669.38] for example
[3669.38 → 3670.46] there are alternative
[3670.46 → 3672.12] rendering primitives
[3672.12 → 3673.42] that's exactly
[3673.42 → 3674.44] to triangles
[3674.44 → 3675.52] which are actually
[3675.52 → 3676.52] quite feasible
[3676.52 → 3677.44] in compute
[3677.44 → 3678.52] if someone gave us
[3678.52 → 3679.00] a card
[3679.00 → 3679.74] with only
[3679.74 → 3681.42] compute pipeline
[3681.42 → 3682.38] I bet we could
[3682.38 → 3683.34] build an engine
[3683.34 → 3683.90] around it
[3683.90 → 3684.46] and it would be
[3684.46 → 3685.46] plenty fast
[3685.46 → 3686.54] I'm not saying
[3686.54 → 3687.54] that the graphics pipeline
[3687.54 → 3688.08] will disappear
[3688.08 → 3688.82] anytime soon
[3688.82 → 3689.44] or ever
[3689.44 → 3690.90] but it's by no means
[3690.90 → 3691.94] certain that it is
[3691.94 → 3692.58] necessary
[3692.58 → 3693.60] it's quite possible
[3693.60 → 3694.92] that in 5 years time
[3694.92 → 3695.52] Nitrous'
[3695.82 → 3697.30] rendering pipeline
[3697.30 → 3698.10] is 100%
[3698.10 → 3698.56] implemented
[3698.56 → 3700.70] via compute shaders
[3700.70 → 3702.64] interesting stuff
[3702.64 → 3703.50] for the graphics world
[3703.50 → 3703.98] yeah
[3703.98 → 3705.58] definitely
[3705.58 → 3708.70] Kodak said
[3708.70 → 3709.82] as far as I know
[3709.82 → 3710.70] Maxwell doesn't
[3710.70 → 3712.14] support async compute
[3712.14 → 3713.74] at least not natively
[3713.74 → 3714.66] we disabled it
[3714.66 → 3715.76] at the request of NVIDIA
[3715.76 → 3716.98] as it was much slower
[3716.98 → 3717.92] to try and use it
[3717.92 → 3718.78] than to not
[3718.78 → 3719.62] whether
[3719.62 → 3720.88] async compute is better
[3720.88 → 3721.94] or is not
[3721.94 → 3722.54] is subjective
[3722.54 → 3723.92] but it definitely does
[3723.92 → 3724.84] buy some performance
[3724.84 → 3725.84] on AMD's hardware
[3725.84 → 3726.74] whether it is
[3726.74 → 3727.52] the right architectural
[3727.52 → 3728.74] decision for Maxwell
[3728.74 → 3729.72] or not
[3729.72 → 3730.38] is relevant
[3730.38 → 3731.26] to its
[3731.26 → 3732.92] scheduler
[3732.92 → 3734.82] hard to say
[3734.82 → 3736.50] because
[3736.50 → 3737.48] the last little quote
[3737.48 → 3738.28] here from Rob
[3738.28 → 3739.22] Halle ck from AMD
[3739.22 → 3740.14] chimed in on the matter
[3740.14 → 3741.56] Oxide effectively
[3741.56 → 3742.50] summarized my thoughts
[3742.50 → 3742.88] on the matter
[3742.88 → 3743.58] NVIDIA claims
[3743.58 → 3744.38] full support
[3744.38 → 3745.14] for DX12
[3745.14 → 3746.40] but conveniently ignores
[3746.40 → 3746.92] that Maxwell
[3746.92 → 3748.20] is utterly incapable
[3748.20 → 3749.06] of performing
[3749.06 → 3750.32] asynchronous compute
[3750.32 → 3751.58] with heavy reliance
[3751.58 → 3752.20] on slow
[3752.20 → 3753.20] context switching
[3753.20 → 3753.88] without heavy reliance
[3753.88 → 3754.60] on slow context switching
[3754.60 → 3755.02] yes without
[3755.02 → 3755.36] sorry
[3755.36 → 3756.52] yeah
[3756.52 → 3757.24] very important
[3757.24 → 3757.74] he's not saying
[3757.74 → 3758.96] that it is fully capable
[3758.96 → 3759.32] of it
[3759.32 → 3760.22] but that it will need
[3760.22 → 3761.20] outside assistance
[3761.20 → 3763.06] so definitely
[3763.06 → 3763.66] a little bit of drama
[3763.66 → 3764.10] going on
[3764.10 → 3764.92] so this
[3764.92 → 3766.56] is going to be
[3766.56 → 3768.40] basically
[3768.40 → 3769.64] an absolute shitstorm
[3769.64 → 3770.32] yeah
[3770.32 → 3771.66] um
[3771.66 → 3772.56] I'm sure there's stuff
[3772.56 → 3773.62] blowing up around this
[3773.62 → 3774.52] um
[3774.52 → 3775.12] let me turn
[3775.12 → 3776.26] rip that up
[3776.26 → 3776.74] a little bit
[3776.74 → 3778.12] um
[3778.12 → 3779.50] yeah I think
[3779.50 → 3780.16] I think our audio
[3780.16 → 3781.16] is okay at this point
[3781.16 → 3782.90] maybe refresh the stream
[3782.90 → 3783.66] if you're having problems
[3783.66 → 3784.32] although you wouldn't
[3784.32 → 3785.28] be able to hear that
[3785.28 → 3786.16] wrecked
[3786.16 → 3787.34] I'll type that in chat
[3787.34 → 3788.40] um
[3788.40 → 3792.02] yeah but
[3792.02 → 3792.64] I don't know
[3792.64 → 3793.32] I hope they figure
[3793.32 → 3794.08] their stuff out
[3794.08 → 3794.68] I like
[3794.68 → 3796.04] um
[3796.04 → 3798.46] I like it when
[3798.46 → 3798.98] these companies
[3798.98 → 3799.64] have to kind of
[3799.64 → 3800.64] scrap for things
[3800.64 → 3801.36] it's good
[3801.36 → 3802.18] absolutely
[3802.18 → 3802.96] but a quote that
[3802.96 → 3803.42] I've been saying
[3803.42 → 3804.14] a lot lately
[3804.14 → 3805.78] is um
[3805.78 → 3807.22] competition is good
[3807.22 → 3807.92] if the competition
[3807.92 → 3808.54] is good
[3808.54 → 3809.68] yeah
[3809.68 → 3810.52] because I was
[3810.52 → 3811.02] I was talking to
[3811.02 → 3811.80] someone about VR
[3811.80 → 3812.64] and they were
[3812.64 → 3813.46] bringing up a whole
[3813.46 → 3814.74] bunch of uh
[3814.74 → 3815.62] kind of auxiliary
[3815.62 → 3816.58] VR companies
[3816.58 → 3817.84] because right now
[3817.84 → 3818.60] if you're looking at
[3818.60 → 3819.72] VR in terms of
[3819.72 → 3820.10] hardware
[3820.10 → 3820.88] if you're not
[3820.88 → 3821.58] looking at Oculus
[3821.58 → 3823.02] or Valve
[3823.02 → 3824.00] they're more
[3824.00 → 3824.98] auxiliary companies
[3824.98 → 3825.52] outside that
[3825.52 → 3825.70] yep
[3825.70 → 3827.26] and some of them
[3827.26 → 3828.10] are very interesting
[3828.10 → 3829.82] and might
[3829.82 → 3831.22] kind of plant their
[3831.22 → 3832.16] feet and be able
[3832.16 → 3832.86] to hold there
[3832.86 → 3833.80] some of them I think
[3833.80 → 3834.28] are just going to
[3834.28 → 3834.82] fall away
[3834.82 → 3836.02] and one of my
[3836.02 → 3836.96] points was that
[3836.96 → 3837.92] I hope the ones
[3837.92 → 3838.36] that are going to
[3838.36 → 3838.88] fall away
[3838.88 → 3840.08] because they suck
[3840.08 → 3841.14] fall away very
[3841.14 → 3841.52] quickly
[3841.52 → 3842.60] because competition
[3842.60 → 3843.04] is good
[3843.04 → 3843.66] like I just said
[3843.66 → 3845.02] if the competition
[3845.02 → 3845.36] is good
[3845.36 → 3846.02] if your competition
[3846.02 → 3846.72] is terrible
[3846.72 → 3847.22] and there's a
[3847.22 → 3847.84] bunch of it
[3847.84 → 3848.70] it's just going to
[3848.70 → 3849.76] muddy the space
[3849.76 → 3851.22] and someone's going
[3851.22 → 3851.86] to try out one of
[3851.86 → 3852.32] those things
[3852.32 → 3852.78] and go like
[3852.78 → 3853.68] oh this is terrible
[3853.68 → 3855.06] therefore this whole
[3855.06 → 3855.90] space is terrible
[3855.90 → 3856.56] just brand
[3856.56 → 3856.82] yeah
[3856.82 → 3857.14] yeah
[3857.14 → 3858.02] so you kind of
[3858.02 → 3858.50] want things to
[3858.50 → 3859.32] work
[3859.32 → 3859.72] and if
[3859.72 → 3860.84] if this is all
[3860.84 → 3861.30] true
[3861.30 → 3861.90] everything we just
[3861.90 → 3862.46] talked about
[3862.46 → 3863.34] and they're claiming
[3863.34 → 3864.04] full support
[3864.04 → 3864.64] and it doesn't have
[3864.64 → 3865.26] full support
[3865.26 → 3867.16] you need to fix that
[3867.16 → 3867.58] yep
[3867.58 → 3868.28] absolutely
[3868.28 → 3869.58] because I want it
[3869.58 → 3870.44] to come down to
[3870.44 → 3871.76] this card has
[3871.76 → 3872.44] these features
[3872.44 → 3873.70] and is this fast
[3873.70 → 3874.84] and therefore
[3874.84 → 3875.62] I want it
[3875.62 → 3876.56] over this one
[3876.56 → 3878.08] and vice versa
[3878.08 → 3879.52] instead of like
[3879.52 → 3880.98] this card says
[3880.98 → 3881.46] that it can do
[3881.46 → 3881.94] this thing
[3881.94 → 3882.62] and can't
[3882.62 → 3883.22] and therefore
[3883.22 → 3884.12] I don't know
[3884.12 → 3884.80] what I want
[3884.80 → 3885.32] but I guess
[3885.32 → 3885.78] that one
[3885.78 → 3886.12] because it can
[3886.12 → 3886.98] do all the things
[3886.98 → 3887.52] you have a
[3887.52 → 3888.06] somewhat related
[3888.06 → 3888.46] video
[3888.46 → 3889.32] which I watched
[3889.32 → 3889.60] today
[3889.60 → 3890.34] about graphics
[3890.34 → 3890.92] cards saying
[3890.92 → 3891.20] what they're
[3891.20 → 3891.44] hitting
[3891.44 → 3891.76] what they're
[3891.76 → 3892.34] actually hitting
[3892.34 → 3893.60] oh the GPU
[3893.60 → 3894.58] boost investigation
[3894.58 → 3896.16] yeah
[3896.16 → 3897.54] that's interesting
[3897.54 → 3899.12] that's not as bad
[3899.12 → 3899.68] I don't think
[3899.68 → 3901.28] because it ends
[3901.28 → 3901.64] up actually
[3901.64 → 3902.40] running faster
[3902.40 → 3903.48] it's just weird
[3903.48 → 3904.18] and confusing
[3904.18 → 3905.46] it just reminded
[3905.46 → 3906.12] me of that video
[3906.12 → 3906.48] when you were
[3906.48 → 3906.98] mentioning that
[3906.98 → 3907.30] yeah
[3907.30 → 3907.76] yeah
[3907.76 → 3907.98] yeah
[3907.98 → 3908.92] so check that
[3908.92 → 3909.20] video out
[3909.20 → 3909.54] if you want
[3909.54 → 3909.94] basically
[3909.94 → 3911.36] when you buy
[3911.36 → 3912.34] a current
[3912.34 → 3913.48] Nvidia graphics
[3913.48 → 3913.92] card
[3913.92 → 3915.14] it will
[3915.14 → 3915.84] they'll have
[3915.84 → 3916.48] an advertised
[3916.48 → 3917.18] boost clock
[3917.18 → 3917.54] speed
[3917.54 → 3918.22] which is not
[3918.22 → 3918.70] what it will
[3918.70 → 3919.24] boost to
[3919.24 → 3919.82] at all
[3919.82 → 3920.76] I've never
[3920.76 → 3921.50] seen it actually
[3921.50 → 3922.16] boost to that
[3922.16 → 3922.66] number on
[3922.66 → 3923.40] any graphics card
[3923.40 → 3923.96] that I've tested
[3923.96 → 3924.92] in the current
[3924.92 → 3925.20] gen
[3925.20 → 3925.98] so
[3925.98 → 3927.06] yeah
[3927.06 → 3927.84] and the cards
[3927.84 → 3928.10] that we were
[3928.10 → 3928.50] testing were
[3928.50 → 3928.86] like hitting
[3928.86 → 3929.48] thermal limits
[3929.48 → 3929.92] and stuff
[3929.92 → 3930.70] automatically
[3930.70 → 3931.30] so if I had
[3931.30 → 3931.82] ones that weren't
[3931.82 → 3932.18] doing that
[3932.18 → 3932.76] automatically
[3932.76 → 3933.26] we'd probably
[3933.26 → 3933.88] even see more
[3933.88 → 3934.30] variants
[3934.30 → 3935.78] but anyway
[3935.78 → 3936.58] very interesting
[3936.58 → 3937.40] I'm excited to
[3937.40 → 3937.86] see how this
[3937.86 → 3938.24] develops
[3938.24 → 3939.14] I'm sure
[3939.14 → 3940.38] this is not
[3940.38 → 3940.80] the last
[3940.80 → 3941.18] we've heard
[3941.18 → 3941.76] about this
[3941.76 → 3943.80] someone is
[3943.80 → 3944.24] going to want
[3944.24 → 3944.90] to step up
[3944.90 → 3945.58] and probably
[3945.58 → 3946.16] angrily
[3946.16 → 3946.74] and we'll
[3946.74 → 3947.48] learn more
[3947.48 → 3947.94] things
[3947.94 → 3950.82] yeah
[3950.82 → 3951.54] that's pretty
[3951.54 → 3951.94] much all I have
[3951.94 → 3952.32] to say about
[3952.32 → 3953.10] that is
[3953.10 → 3954.08] stay tuned
[3954.08 → 3954.66] and we'll find
[3954.66 → 3954.90] out
[3954.90 → 3955.70] if that's true
[3955.70 → 3956.74] that sucks
[3956.74 → 3958.16] hopefully they
[3958.16 → 3958.52] fix it
[3958.52 → 3959.02] if it's not
[3959.02 → 3959.34] true
[3959.34 → 3960.38] well then
[3960.38 → 3960.68] what the hell
[3960.68 → 3961.24] is going on
[3961.24 → 3961.84] I don't know
[3961.84 → 3963.46] we will see
[3963.46 → 3965.60] I'm scrolling
[3965.60 → 3966.36] down a bunch
[3966.36 → 3967.02] give me a second
[3967.02 → 3968.40] there's the
[3968.40 → 3970.08] trying to find
[3970.08 → 3970.48] it right now
[3970.48 → 3970.86] the new
[3970.86 → 3971.58] Google car
[3971.58 → 3972.00] app
[3972.00 → 3973.64] oh what
[3973.64 → 3974.78] Samsung launches
[3974.78 → 3975.44] car mode
[3975.44 → 3976.14] for Galaxy
[3976.14 → 3976.40] yes
[3976.40 → 3977.54] I know nothing
[3977.54 → 3977.90] about this
[3977.90 → 3978.38] go for gold
[3978.38 → 3979.08] I'll get this
[3979.08 → 3979.54] posted in the
[3979.54 → 3980.06] twitch chat
[3980.06 → 3981.98] there we go
[3981.98 → 3982.70] okay so
[3982.70 → 3983.78] Samsung has
[3983.78 → 3984.84] offered a car
[3984.84 → 3985.34] mode on its
[3985.34 → 3986.04] phones, but it's
[3986.04 → 3987.12] being refined
[3987.12 → 3987.98] leading the way
[3987.98 → 3988.64] with car mode
[3988.64 → 3990.00] is that it
[3990.00 → 3990.46] offers a
[3990.46 → 3991.12] standalone mode
[3991.12 → 3991.40] for those
[3991.40 → 3992.04] situations where
[3992.04 → 3992.54] cars aren't
[3992.54 → 3993.66] compatible which
[3993.66 → 3994.94] in most case
[3994.94 → 3995.50] since only newer
[3995.50 → 3996.20] cars offer
[3996.20 → 3997.26] offer it
[3997.26 → 3998.76] it's able to be
[3998.76 → 3999.54] compatible for
[3999.54 → 4000.18] older cars
[4000.18 → 4001.82] now as you're
[4001.82 → 4002.22] looking that up
[4002.22 → 4002.46] I want to
[4002.46 → 4003.08] segue a little
[4003.08 → 4003.96] bit I think
[4003.96 → 4004.36] we're in a
[4004.36 → 4004.92] really interesting
[4004.92 → 4005.60] place in the
[4005.60 → 4006.34] car market I'm
[4006.34 → 4007.06] a car enthusiast
[4007.06 → 4007.76] myself a lot of
[4007.76 → 4008.64] people at LMG are
[4008.64 → 4010.64] not including
[4010.64 → 4011.62] Tesla because
[4011.62 → 4012.06] they're doing
[4012.06 → 4012.80] things right
[4012.80 → 4014.06] I think basically
[4014.06 → 4014.94] everyone else
[4014.94 → 4015.92] and a lot of
[4015.92 → 4016.52] the and you
[4016.52 → 4016.80] could say
[4016.80 → 4017.36] American car
[4017.36 → 4017.96] manufacturers but
[4017.96 → 4018.36] it's not true
[4018.36 → 4019.16] even the imports
[4019.16 → 4021.02] as well imports
[4021.02 → 4021.48] you know the
[4021.48 → 4023.08] Toyota's Volkswagen
[4023.08 → 4023.58] to the world
[4023.58 → 4025.02] everyone's somewhat
[4025.02 → 4025.76] at a starting
[4025.76 → 4026.64] line I feel like
[4026.64 → 4027.24] they've all been
[4027.24 → 4028.16] making cars for a
[4028.16 → 4029.04] very long time
[4029.04 → 4029.94] they've all done a
[4029.94 → 4030.76] decent job at
[4030.76 → 4031.44] their own kind of
[4031.44 → 4032.10] niche markets
[4032.10 → 4033.20] whatever they're
[4033.20 → 4034.22] trying to hit with
[4034.22 → 4034.94] their different cars
[4034.94 → 4035.48] or trucks or
[4035.48 → 4036.22] whatever it may be
[4036.22 → 4037.56] but now vehicles
[4037.56 → 4038.40] are becoming a
[4038.40 → 4039.88] tech item and I
[4039.88 → 4040.88] feel like a lot of
[4040.88 → 4041.52] the manufacturers
[4041.52 → 4042.06] have been around
[4042.06 → 4042.56] forever they're
[4042.56 → 4043.06] all the same
[4043.06 → 4044.18] starting line and
[4044.18 → 4044.80] this is something
[4044.80 → 4045.16] that's going to
[4045.16 → 4046.04] slightly differentiate
[4046.04 → 4046.76] each other because
[4046.76 → 4048.10] I know it's its
[4048.10 → 4049.12] Honda Toyota and
[4049.12 → 4049.82] Volkswagen I'm not
[4049.82 → 4050.56] surprised at all that
[4050.56 → 4051.00] it's those three
[4051.00 → 4051.92] brands that are
[4051.92 → 4052.60] moving forward with
[4052.60 → 4055.36] this there is no
[4055.36 → 4056.70] car I think yours
[4056.70 → 4057.70] does a decent job
[4057.70 → 4058.54] but I don't think
[4058.54 → 4059.60] there's any car
[4059.60 → 4060.18] besides the Tesla
[4060.18 → 4060.74] right now that has
[4060.74 → 4061.86] a great screen
[4061.86 → 4064.34] touchscreen experience
[4064.34 → 4065.64] for the user I
[4065.64 → 4066.26] think they're all
[4066.26 → 4068.68] kind of okay and
[4068.68 → 4069.34] we're spending so
[4069.34 → 4070.18] much money on them
[4070.18 → 4072.94] we're spending so
[4072.94 → 4073.78] much money on them
[4073.78 → 4074.76] and they're just
[4074.76 → 4075.42] they're just
[4075.42 → 4076.26] lacklustre they're
[4076.26 → 4077.18] just not what they
[4077.18 → 4077.80] need to be hopefully
[4077.80 → 4078.82] this is a step in the
[4078.82 → 4079.96] right direction because
[4079.96 → 4080.92] I feel like any car
[4080.92 → 4081.58] company that's really
[4081.58 → 4082.74] going to hit it out of
[4082.74 → 4083.30] the gate is going to
[4083.30 → 4084.12] do extremely well
[4084.12 → 4084.62] because everyone else
[4084.62 → 4085.46] does a terrible job
[4085.46 → 4086.48] I'm a Ford fan
[4086.48 → 4088.00] they're my touch
[4088.00 → 4089.78] terrible hate it got
[4089.78 → 4090.52] nothing good to say
[4090.52 → 4091.32] about it, you know
[4091.32 → 4091.64] what I mean like
[4091.64 → 4092.86] yours is pretty good
[4092.86 → 4093.38] but I feel like
[4093.38 → 4094.14] there's and yours is a
[4094.14 → 4095.42] 2009 yeah let's add
[4095.42 → 4096.18] that in there as well
[4096.18 → 4096.98] you know what I
[4096.98 → 4098.24] mean in my thing
[4098.24 → 4099.34] that bothers me about
[4099.34 → 4100.72] mine being a 2009 is
[4100.72 → 4103.84] I'll sit in newer cars
[4103.84 → 4105.78] like I was in a very
[4105.78 → 4107.16] new truck yesterday
[4107.16 → 4108.24] driving a very new
[4108.24 → 4109.30] truck that another dude
[4109.30 → 4110.46] owns that I know
[4110.46 → 4111.10] because I had to move
[4111.10 → 4112.62] a chair long story
[4112.62 → 4114.46] and it's a very nice
[4114.46 → 4115.88] truck and the dash
[4115.88 → 4117.26] the screen on the dash
[4117.26 → 4118.88] excessively similar to
[4118.88 → 4119.76] mine in terms of
[4119.76 → 4121.10] resolution how it works
[4121.10 → 4121.70] all that kind of stuff
[4121.70 → 4121.96] what was it?
[4122.86 → 4124.00] a Dodge
[4124.00 → 4124.42] a Dodge?
[4124.42 → 4125.62] see I even like the
[4125.62 → 4126.16] Dodge ones
[4126.16 → 4126.96] I even think the
[4126.96 → 4127.86] Dodge ones do a pretty
[4127.86 → 4128.66] good job but they
[4128.66 → 4129.54] could be so much
[4129.54 → 4129.86] better
[4129.86 → 4131.12] that's the thing like
[4131.12 → 4131.98] you look at tablets
[4131.98 → 4132.86] you look at computers
[4132.86 → 4133.66] you look at laptops
[4133.66 → 4134.42] you look at phones
[4134.42 → 4135.10] you look at all these
[4135.10 → 4135.64] different markets
[4135.64 → 4136.94] and they're moving so
[4136.94 → 4138.60] fast and then vehicles
[4138.60 → 4139.50] it's just like well
[4139.50 → 4141.66] turn the dial
[4141.66 → 4142.52] do the thing
[4142.52 → 4143.26] I don't know
[4143.26 → 4144.56] I've got the
[4144.56 → 4145.76] I did the Nexus 7
[4145.76 → 4147.00] install in my dash
[4147.00 → 4147.74] which was kind of a
[4147.74 → 4149.22] pain, but it looks
[4149.22 → 4150.32] fantastic it's a two
[4150.32 → 4150.98] year old tablet
[4150.98 → 4152.86] and the PPI is
[4152.86 → 4153.78] uncomparable to anything
[4153.78 → 4154.48] else that's out there
[4154.48 → 4155.28] right now as far as
[4155.28 → 4156.42] buying your vehicle
[4156.42 → 4157.32] but what I'm trying to
[4157.32 → 4158.36] say by this is it's a
[4158.36 → 4159.22] fascinating article
[4159.22 → 4160.14] check it out I think
[4160.14 → 4160.76] Luke linked it
[4160.76 → 4161.74] no someone sorry
[4161.74 → 4162.90] someone misunderstood
[4162.90 → 4163.54] what I was saying
[4163.54 → 4164.32] I'm not complaining
[4164.32 → 4165.16] about driving the
[4165.16 → 4166.50] Acura I'm saying
[4166.50 → 4167.60] it's weird that my
[4167.60 → 4168.78] cars from 2009
[4168.78 → 4170.74] were now going into
[4170.74 → 4172.64] fairly soon 2016
[4172.64 → 4173.96] yeah, and I'm not
[4173.96 → 4175.30] seeing huge differences
[4175.30 → 4176.92] it's awesome that my
[4176.92 → 4177.78] car has that that's
[4177.78 → 4178.72] great I love that I'm
[4178.72 → 4179.34] not complaining about
[4179.34 → 4180.34] that at all what's
[4180.34 → 4182.66] crazy is that if you
[4182.66 → 4183.50] go look at a phone
[4183.50 → 4184.84] from 2009 and
[4184.84 → 4186.08] compare to it a phone
[4186.08 → 4187.20] that's going to be
[4187.20 → 4188.62] coming out now and
[4188.62 → 4190.66] yes no not at all
[4190.66 → 4191.52] completely different
[4191.52 → 4192.82] absolutely
[4192.82 → 4193.46] what's up Dennis
[4193.46 → 4196.02] hi come say hi to the
[4196.02 → 4197.82] stream come on no
[4197.82 → 4198.38] get in front of the
[4198.38 → 4198.62] camera
[4198.62 → 4201.10] Dennis is ready to go
[4201.10 → 4201.62] home I think
[4201.62 → 4202.58] you're leaving oh
[4202.58 → 4203.62] yeah it's after work
[4203.62 → 4205.42] now say hi
[4205.42 → 4207.80] hello
[4207.80 → 4209.70] no not quite this is
[4209.70 → 4210.66] the actual show I
[4210.66 → 4211.42] just wanted Dennis to
[4211.42 → 4211.72] say hi
[4211.72 → 4215.66] you're reading the
[4215.66 → 4216.22] chat Dennis
[4216.22 → 4218.34] Dennis hype yeah
[4218.34 → 4218.98] Dennis hype
[4218.98 → 4219.72] they're happy to see
[4219.72 → 4219.80] you
[4219.80 → 4221.80] bye
[4221.80 → 4224.72] okay bye Dennis
[4224.72 → 4226.08] so one of the big
[4226.08 → 4226.82] things with this is
[4226.82 → 4228.18] that you can plug in
[4228.18 → 4228.98] your phone or can
[4228.98 → 4230.84] connect wirelessly and
[4230.84 → 4231.78] then your apps and
[4231.78 → 4232.24] your phone will
[4232.24 → 4233.04] basically appear on the
[4233.04 → 4233.84] screen so that is a
[4233.84 → 4234.40] step forward
[4234.40 → 4236.08] they're kind of
[4236.08 → 4236.84] skirting around having
[4236.84 → 4237.76] to do anything
[4237.76 → 4238.92] themselves I feel like
[4238.92 → 4239.76] they're kind of like
[4239.76 → 4240.70] oh we'll just kind of
[4240.70 → 4241.92] port your phone to
[4241.92 → 4243.24] this screen now yeah
[4243.24 → 4244.00] because that's nice
[4244.00 → 4246.56] but I really feel you
[4246.56 → 4247.50] know I think Tesla's
[4247.50 → 4248.30] done an perfect
[4248.30 → 4248.84] job they're going to be
[4248.84 → 4249.30] coming out with more
[4249.30 → 4251.04] models of cars and
[4251.04 → 4251.96] they'll probably be
[4251.96 → 4253.48] model three model
[4253.48 → 4254.32] three, and they'll be
[4254.32 → 4254.74] they're going to be
[4254.74 → 4255.86] upgrading their screen I
[4255.86 → 4257.66] assume all of you
[4257.66 → 4258.36] domestic car
[4258.36 → 4259.98] manufacturers and you
[4259.98 → 4260.84] know I say domestic
[4260.84 → 4261.98] because you know the
[4261.98 → 4262.82] Toyota's you buy here
[4262.82 → 4263.58] are made here so are
[4263.58 → 4264.38] they know are they
[4264.38 → 4265.28] imported or they not
[4265.28 → 4266.12] debate for a different
[4266.12 → 4268.54] time somebody please
[4268.54 → 4269.54] hit it somebody do it
[4269.54 → 4270.50] well you know what I
[4270.50 → 4271.40] mean because no one's
[4271.40 → 4272.18] doing it well right now
[4272.18 → 4273.24] I agree this is a
[4273.24 → 4274.70] decent step but
[4274.70 → 4276.08] I honestly like a big
[4276.08 → 4276.72] thing that I really
[4276.72 → 4277.68] wanted to do when we
[4277.68 → 4278.74] started Linus Media
[4278.74 → 4282.32] Group was car tech
[4282.32 → 4283.96] reviews yeah I don't
[4283.96 → 4284.54] know if I've talked to
[4284.54 → 4285.10] you about this before
[4285.10 → 4286.74] you talked about I
[4286.74 → 4288.26] guess I shouldn't say
[4288.26 → 4288.78] maybe it's more than
[4288.78 → 4289.76] a certain manufacturer
[4289.76 → 4290.86] approached you
[4290.86 → 4291.64] looked into it and
[4291.64 → 4292.76] kind of said yeah no
[4292.76 → 4293.38] thanks because there's
[4293.38 → 4294.76] nothing yeah and
[4294.76 → 4295.98] that's essentially the
[4295.98 → 4297.22] story is what I
[4297.22 → 4298.64] wanted to do was go
[4298.64 → 4299.44] driving around for a
[4299.44 → 4300.80] car for a while and I
[4300.80 → 4301.90] don't know enough to
[4301.90 → 4302.68] talk to you guys about
[4302.68 → 4304.96] the engine and like how
[4304.96 → 4305.82] it works and if it's
[4305.82 → 4306.60] more efficient than
[4306.60 → 4309.08] whatever, and I don't
[4309.08 → 4309.78] know enough about that
[4309.78 → 4310.44] I know a little bit
[4310.44 → 4312.18] about cars not enough
[4312.18 → 4313.06] to make videos on that
[4313.06 → 4313.78] kind of stuff not the
[4313.78 → 4314.88] technical aspects of
[4314.88 → 4316.72] the moving components
[4316.72 → 4318.70] like the engine but I
[4318.70 → 4319.72] might be able to do a
[4319.72 → 4321.36] proper review of the
[4321.36 → 4322.42] tech that's inside the
[4322.42 → 4324.90] car, but I'd make a
[4324.90 → 4326.68] video every year yeah
[4326.68 → 4327.68] and it would be like
[4327.68 → 4329.68] yep not much has
[4329.68 → 4331.08] changed you can have a
[4331.08 → 4332.82] Wi-Fi hotspot but you
[4332.82 → 4333.82] could also just do that
[4333.82 → 4335.88] on your phone yeah which
[4335.88 → 4337.96] I do so why would you
[4337.96 → 4339.06] buy another sim for your
[4339.06 → 4341.12] car yeah I don't know
[4341.12 → 4342.80] like there 's's some
[4342.80 → 4343.94] actually really cool
[4343.94 → 4344.94] someone just said mighty
[4344.94 → 4346.30] car mods I believe that's
[4346.30 → 4347.20] a YouTube channel that I've
[4347.20 → 4348.66] seen and is awesome car
[4348.66 → 4349.78] mods are fantastic I'm
[4349.78 → 4350.72] out of the Nexus 7 into
[4350.72 → 4351.80] my dash it took me quite
[4351.80 → 4352.36] a while to get all the
[4352.36 → 4354.00] bugs out it runs great
[4354.00 → 4355.12] there's some super cool
[4355.12 → 4356.16] stuff on YouTube in terms
[4356.16 → 4356.88] of cars, but that's
[4356.88 → 4358.00] exactly why I didn't want
[4358.00 → 4358.96] to do the same thing
[4358.96 → 4360.02] yeah I wanted to do
[4360.02 → 4360.60] something slightly
[4360.60 → 4361.16] different because these
[4361.16 → 4362.32] guys are already awesome
[4362.32 → 4363.28] you're not looking to
[4363.28 → 4364.14] mods you're looking at
[4364.14 → 4364.86] what's coming out
[4364.86 → 4367.14] because I can't do that
[4367.14 → 4368.00] and like there 's's
[4368.00 → 4368.64] certain guys I don't
[4368.64 → 4369.52] remember what channel was
[4369.52 → 4370.38] maybe it was a mighty car
[4370.38 → 4371.52] mods they're from I think
[4371.52 → 4372.90] Australia, and they buy
[4372.90 → 4374.50] like a couple of the
[4374.50 → 4375.82] similar car, and they'll
[4375.82 → 4376.72] just like zombie them
[4376.72 → 4377.72] together like I did with
[4377.72 → 4378.74] computers back in the day
[4378.74 → 4380.30] and make like a couple
[4380.30 → 4381.80] throwaway cars basically
[4381.80 → 4383.78] and make one good
[4383.78 → 4385.00] drivable car out of it
[4385.00 → 4386.12] for like way cheaper
[4386.12 → 4386.88] than buying a new one
[4386.88 → 4387.98] and like I watched one
[4387.98 → 4388.54] episode, and it was
[4388.54 → 4390.48] actually super cool so
[4390.48 → 4391.16] I was saying chopped
[4391.16 → 4395.36] maybe that's it I don't
[4395.36 → 4396.38] know, but honestly it was
[4396.38 → 4398.32] awesome I like
[4398.32 → 4399.18] watching car videos
[4399.18 → 4400.46] anyway yeah we'll move
[4400.46 → 4403.58] on to more stuff but I
[4403.58 → 4404.74] don't know guys pick it
[4404.74 → 4406.02] up move forward the tech
[4406.02 → 4407.40] and the Tesla is sick
[4407.40 → 4408.74] you guys can do that
[4408.74 → 4411.60] like I love Tesla but
[4411.60 → 4412.42] it's not that hard
[4412.42 → 4413.64] no it's not that hard
[4413.64 → 4414.62] it's really you could
[4414.62 → 4416.36] copy that or do even
[4416.36 → 4418.00] better honestly without
[4418.00 → 4418.78] that's what's so
[4418.78 → 4419.82] frustrating about it you
[4419.82 → 4420.48] know and especially
[4420.48 → 4422.78] you know I'll go after
[4422.78 → 4423.66] it again because I've
[4423.66 → 4424.64] got an older F-150 the
[4424.64 → 4425.60] brand new F-150 came
[4425.60 → 4427.44] out the 2015 model they
[4427.44 → 4428.24] advertised all these
[4428.24 → 4429.14] different things I got
[4429.14 → 4429.80] caught up a little bit in
[4429.80 → 4430.46] the hype not like I was
[4430.46 → 4431.56] going to buy one I was like
[4431.56 → 4432.30] oh man this is going to be
[4432.30 → 4433.76] so cool, and I was really
[4433.76 → 4434.32] excited because they
[4434.32 → 4435.08] weren't saying anything
[4435.08 → 4436.04] about that centre console
[4436.04 → 4437.70] nobody's doing it right
[4437.70 → 4438.66] nobody's doing it right
[4438.66 → 4439.92] except for the Tesla get
[4439.92 → 4441.48] on the level they are now
[4441.48 → 4442.80] tech pieces you know you
[4442.80 → 4443.74] know your big advertising
[4443.74 → 4444.80] feature that your truck can
[4444.80 → 4446.44] be a hot spot is not or
[4446.44 → 4447.30] your car can be a hot spot
[4447.30 → 4448.76] is not interesting that's
[4448.76 → 4450.26] not engaging to me, you can
[4450.26 → 4451.78] go to any phone retailer
[4451.78 → 4452.72] up here you can go to
[4452.72 → 4453.90] Rogers tell us when any of
[4453.90 → 4454.62] them buy a little tiny
[4454.62 → 4455.88] capsule I saw one that
[4455.88 → 4456.70] looked like a cute egg
[4456.70 → 4458.84] once you give it power it
[4458.84 → 4459.96] gives you a 3G network
[4459.96 → 4461.56] this is old this is not
[4461.56 → 4462.24] new this is not
[4462.24 → 4463.90] interesting and especially
[4463.90 → 4464.44] when you're trying to
[4464.44 → 4465.54] market to a younger
[4465.54 → 4467.06] generation that's into
[4467.06 → 4468.04] tech into their phones
[4468.04 → 4469.06] you know you've got you
[4469.06 → 4470.46] know the note 5 came out
[4470.46 → 4471.78] get something that is
[4471.78 → 4473.40] somewhat comparable to
[4473.40 → 4474.52] that level or the new LG
[4474.52 → 4475.62] phones anything like that
[4475.62 → 4477.94] honestly and someone in
[4477.94 → 4478.50] the chat
[4478.50 → 4481.00] drosophilas
[4481.00 → 4482.04] drosophilas
[4482.04 → 4483.02] drosophilas
[4483.02 → 4483.54] I don't know
[4483.54 → 4485.06] he said you can't compare
[4485.06 → 4487.38] a 209 but 2009 Acura
[4487.38 → 4488.88] with a modern pickup truck
[4488.88 → 4489.72] compare it to a modern
[4489.72 → 4490.64] Acura, and you'll see
[4490.64 → 4492.76] differences valid point
[4492.76 → 4494.30] except that I have and
[4494.30 → 4495.32] there isn't major ones
[4495.32 → 4496.16] yeah I actually
[4496.16 → 4497.46] there are two screens I
[4497.46 → 4498.92] think, but I just don't
[4498.92 → 4499.64] care about the second
[4499.64 → 4500.48] one because it's
[4500.48 → 4501.40] honestly just easier to
[4501.40 → 4502.24] do with physical buttons
[4502.24 → 4504.74] so like I don't know
[4504.74 → 4506.82] man I did and there
[4506.82 → 4508.42] wasn't significant change
[4508.42 → 4510.16] that I would expect from
[4510.16 → 4511.22] that many years
[4511.22 → 4512.00] definitely not
[4512.00 → 4512.74] like your comment about
[4512.74 → 4513.10] the phone
[4513.10 → 4515.42] yeah yeah it's its not
[4515.42 → 4517.46] even similar at all to
[4517.46 → 4519.34] the change that there has
[4519.34 → 4520.32] been in the phone market
[4520.32 → 4522.06] so absolutely all right I
[4522.06 → 4522.98] think I beat this one up
[4522.98 → 4524.06] yeah
[4524.06 → 4526.12] a little bit let's move
[4526.12 → 4526.40] on
[4526.40 → 4529.08] Microsoft quietly rewrites
[4529.08 → 4530.30] its activation rules for
[4530.30 → 4530.98] Windows 10
[4530.98 → 4532.44] this is from ZD Nets I'm
[4532.44 → 4533.06] going to try to get you
[4533.06 → 4534.58] guys a link, and I'll try
[4534.58 → 4535.26] to get it up on the
[4535.26 → 4536.56] screen, and I'll do all the
[4536.56 → 4537.16] fun things
[4537.16 → 4539.00] apparently the net result is
[4539.00 → 4540.14] that clean installs will be
[4540.14 → 4540.92] much easier
[4540.92 → 4542.68] that totally caters to me
[4542.68 → 4544.10] I'm a clean installation guy I
[4544.10 → 4544.76] always have been
[4544.76 → 4547.92] I'm still on 8.1, but I'm
[4547.92 → 4548.70] just kind of waiting for a
[4548.70 → 4549.44] little bit then I will be
[4549.44 → 4550.46] going to the 10 of course
[4550.46 → 4551.60] and it'll be a clean
[4551.60 → 4552.36] install that's what I want
[4552.36 → 4553.64] to do I've never been a
[4553.64 → 4554.38] big fan of the upgrade
[4554.38 → 4556.16] experience it also kind of
[4556.16 → 4557.12] forces me to clean my
[4557.12 → 4557.76] computer up
[4557.76 → 4559.20] yeah that's one of the
[4559.20 → 4560.02] reasons why I kind of like
[4560.02 → 4561.94] it because honestly the
[4561.94 → 4563.18] upgrade experience thing I
[4563.18 → 4564.38] kind of agree I didn't like
[4564.38 → 4565.60] it before Windows 10s
[4565.60 → 4566.36] upgrade experience is
[4566.36 → 4567.68] actually perfect though
[4567.68 → 4568.08] good
[4568.08 → 4571.72] and like I tried to test out
[4571.72 → 4573.14] the beta and my whole idea
[4573.14 → 4574.88] was like you know what I'll
[4574.88 → 4575.84] try it if it doesn't work
[4575.84 → 4576.80] on a 3 format, and it'll be
[4576.80 → 4578.14] fine, and then I was like oh
[4578.14 → 4580.18] rollback I can just roll back
[4580.18 → 4582.08] to my Windows 7 install this
[4582.08 → 4583.38] will break everything but
[4583.38 → 4584.58] let's try it, so I rolled it
[4584.58 → 4585.68] back, and it was perfect
[4585.68 → 4586.08] really
[4586.08 → 4587.76] which was crazy I never had a
[4587.76 → 4589.00] single problem, and then I've
[4589.00 → 4590.96] upgraded again once Windows 10
[4590.96 → 4593.00] came out off that same install
[4593.00 → 4594.40] back up to Windows 10 and it
[4594.40 → 4595.12] was fine again
[4595.12 → 4595.56] wow
[4595.56 → 4596.62] which was actually pretty
[4596.62 → 4597.00] impressive
[4597.00 → 4600.18] so yeah I don't know kind of
[4600.18 → 4602.56] cool the biggest change of all
[4602.56 → 4603.32] is that Windows 10s
[4603.32 → 4604.52] activation status is now
[4604.52 → 4606.54] stored online which might be
[4606.54 → 4608.02] terrible for you or good for
[4608.02 → 4609.46] you depending on who you are
[4609.46 → 4611.20] after you successfully activate
[4611.20 → 4612.24] Windows 10 for the first time
[4612.24 → 4614.18] the device will activate
[4614.18 → 4615.66] automatically in the future no
[4615.66 → 4616.80] product key is required
[4616.80 → 4621.08] yeah I don't know unwelcome
[4621.08 → 4622.06] change for those trying to do a
[4622.06 → 4623.20] clean installation of Windows 10
[4623.20 → 4624.32] without understanding the new
[4624.32 → 4626.64] activation landscape is a good
[4626.64 → 4628.74] point yeah I don't know I
[4628.74 → 4629.46] think people are going to be on
[4629.46 → 4630.72] the fence with this maybe let
[4630.72 → 4631.80] straw pull it again and then
[4631.80 → 4633.62] move on, so I'm going to start a
[4633.62 → 4633.94] new one
[4633.94 → 4635.62] straw pulls are fantastic I
[4635.62 → 4637.36] really like straw pulls we
[4637.36 → 4638.68] could make our own but
[4638.68 → 4641.02] considering they made this like
[4641.02 → 4642.54] I've had someone like make a
[4642.54 → 4643.88] Linus media group pull thing
[4643.88 → 4645.16] and I was like you know what
[4645.16 → 4647.68] that's really cool, but we've been
[4647.68 → 4648.92] using these guys since forever
[4648.92 → 4650.26] we're probably like the main
[4650.26 → 4652.06] people that use straw pull I
[4652.06 → 4653.38] I don't know maybe straw
[4653.38 → 4654.66] pull is way bigger than I
[4654.66 → 4656.74] realized, but I don't know I just
[4656.74 → 4657.60] kind of I'm sure you give them a
[4657.60 → 4658.18] lot of traffic
[4658.18 → 4661.82] why can't I type I think I need to
[4661.82 → 4664.38] make a new one there we go
[4664.38 → 4670.58] while we're doing that lets we got
[4670.58 → 4671.52] one topic here that I don't think
[4671.52 → 4672.66] we'll talk about too much but
[4672.66 → 4675.56] cable box rentals a needless 19
[4675.56 → 4678.06] billion dollar industry insane an
[4678.06 → 4679.50] average American house household
[4679.50 → 4680.74] pays two hundred thirty-one
[4680.74 → 4682.00] dollars per year on average for
[4682.00 → 4683.60] their cable box rental estimated
[4683.60 → 4686.68] 99% of cable consumers in the US
[4686.68 → 4689.84] rented their equipment senators who
[4689.84 → 4691.26] commissioned a study on this market
[4691.26 → 4693.92] Ed Marley of Massachusetts and
[4693.92 → 4697.12] Richard blue menthol I'm sure
[4697.12 → 4698.88] that's wrong blue menthol
[4698.88 → 4701.06] apparently straw pulls huge, so I'm
[4701.66 → 4703.26] dumb, and they're massive well you
[4703.26 → 4706.66] guys are huge so maybe you know
[4706.66 → 4709.28] basically just talking about cable
[4709.28 → 4711.72] boxes I've never seen anyone else
[4711.72 → 4713.44] use straw pull but apparently like a
[4713.44 → 4714.66] bunch of people in chatter like it's
[4714.66 → 4716.98] it's absolutely huge so that's cool
[4716.98 → 4719.34] I still want to use them because
[4719.34 → 4720.80] they're still awesome yeah
[4720.80 → 4726.66] square space build it beautiful
[4726.66 → 4729.78] beautiful anyway let's see how the
[4729.78 → 4732.10] straw pull is going let's see the
[4732.10 → 4734.74] results here turn up is this turn up
[4734.74 → 4736.26] but generally people are saying that
[4736.26 → 4740.74] it's good yeah what's up Justin not
[4740.74 → 4743.12] any more yeah you've delayed thanks
[4743.12 → 4745.36] though I appreciate if it's good
[4745.36 → 4749.62] that's good um yeah so 26% of people
[4749.62 → 4751.36] are saying that it's good 17% of people
[4751.36 → 4754.34] are saying that it's bad with 57 my
[4754.34 → 4757.10] favourite number no longer 57 that makes
[4757.10 → 4759.86] me sad 56% of people saying that it is
[4759.86 → 4762.66] turnip so that's uh that's interesting
[4762.66 → 4765.34] I do like I do like seeing the good
[4765.34 → 4766.22] votes though because I haven't
[4766.22 → 4767.64] actually done it myself so seeing the
[4767.64 → 4769.74] good votes is um especially when
[4769.74 → 4771.00] they're warning people about doing you
[4771.00 → 4772.80] know uh fresh install, so I like seeing
[4772.80 → 4775.28] the good vote that's great, thanks guys
[4775.28 → 4779.72] yeah so I think that might conclude the
[4779.72 → 4782.48] show let's see if there's anything new
[4782.48 → 4786.42] here um is there anything else you want
[4786.42 → 4787.88] to talk about what just happened
[4787.88 → 4790.66] about the cable box uh the camera was
[4790.66 → 4792.52] blinking red, and so I'm wondering if it
[4792.52 → 4795.66] now is that a battery the camera died
[4795.66 → 4799.96] that's super the end of the show so um
[4799.96 → 4802.34] could be a radio show now um yeah the
[4802.34 → 4804.38] camera's dead looks like they didn't plug it
[4804.38 → 4807.40] into the wall they had extra batteries I
[4807.40 → 4809.20] saw them playing and talking about extra
[4809.20 → 4810.88] batteries I guess that's the end of the
[4810.88 → 4813.08] WAN show for anyone wondering yes I
[4813.08 → 4814.94] will be doing a 24-hour stream tomorrow
[4814.94 → 4817.84] it will be for charity it will be on uh
[4817.84 → 4819.48] it will be for the extra life charity
[4819.48 → 4822.44] so you can check out links to the extra
[4822.44 → 4824.14] life charity that I'll be running on my
[4824.14 → 4826.12] Twitter I just tweeted out a few times
[4826.12 → 4827.66] I'll tweet it out again after the show
[4827.66 → 4830.62] um check it out tomorrow before noon it
[4830.62 → 4832.06] will start and then again it will go for
[4832.06 → 4835.90] 24 hours I guess that's it I'll roll this
[4835.90 → 4837.46] because you guys can hopefully see it I'm
[4837.46 → 4838.84] going to have to do it a few times so it'll
[4838.84 → 4841.58] start because our stuff kind of sucks
[4841.58 → 4845.84] there we go
[4845.84 → 4856.24] the land show weekly failure
[4856.24 → 4857.20] and
[4857.20 → 4859.02] no
[4859.02 → 4859.34] no
