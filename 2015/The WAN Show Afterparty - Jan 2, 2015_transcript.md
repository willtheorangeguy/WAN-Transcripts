[0.00 --> 4.56]  Alright, so it's sexy after party time.
[4.56 --> 7.56]  Giant yawn time, pretty much.
[7.56 --> 11.44]  I'm so hungry.
[11.44 --> 13.56]  I'm not, actually.
[13.56 --> 15.40]  No, I'm like crazy hungry.
[15.40 --> 20.44]  Usually I would be like, yeah me too man, but no I'm good right now.
[20.44 --> 21.44]  Hey man.
[21.44 --> 22.44]  Sup bros.
[22.44 --> 23.44]  Nice face.
[23.44 --> 24.44]  What?
[24.44 --> 28.40]  Yeah, you're like creeper face.
[28.40 --> 31.00]  We started recreating it and we called it the Nick face and stuff.
[31.00 --> 35.28]  Didn't we call it like the, what was it, like the duck face smile eye pop?
[35.28 --> 38.64]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you had a more descriptive version.
[38.64 --> 39.64]  Sweet.
[39.64 --> 45.40]  I know I was the top trending topic on the biggest win show ever.
[45.40 --> 46.40]  Yeah.
[46.40 --> 47.40]  You had like a bajillion people watching.
[47.40 --> 48.40]  I know, I saw that.
[48.40 --> 49.40]  It's crazy.
[49.40 --> 50.40]  Are you guys live right now?
[50.40 --> 51.40]  Yeah.
[51.40 --> 57.52]  Yeah, we're live on After Party so you can, you know, keep your swear words in your pocket
[57.52 --> 58.52]  where they belong.
[58.52 --> 59.52]  I do.
[59.52 --> 60.52]  Swear words like penis.
[60.52 --> 63.40]  Especially keep penis in your pocket.
[63.40 --> 64.40]  Until later.
[64.40 --> 65.40]  Well then.
[65.40 --> 68.76]  You said you need shirts?
[68.76 --> 70.76]  Um, for what?
[70.76 --> 71.76]  Oh yeah, yeah I need shirts.
[71.76 --> 73.40]  There's a box down there.
[73.40 --> 75.40]  Oh that's right!
[75.40 --> 76.40]  Yeah.
[76.40 --> 77.40]  Oh I'm 5-4ing it up!
[77.40 --> 78.40]  They sent those shirts rather than other shirts.
[78.40 --> 81.40]  They sent those shirts rather than other shirts.
[81.40 --> 82.40]  Oh that's awesome!
[82.40 --> 83.40]  I will be doing no shopping.
[83.40 --> 85.40]  I will be, I will be-
[85.40 --> 86.40]  Whoa what?
[86.40 --> 87.40]  The viewer count just broke.
[87.40 --> 88.40]  Yeah I know right?
[88.40 --> 93.40]  There's clearly more than six people because there's clearly more than six people in chat.
[93.40 --> 94.40]  Okay.
[94.40 --> 97.40]  What a couple of weeks eh?
[97.40 --> 104.40]  It has been a crazy time around here.
[104.40 --> 106.40]  I'm still logging down CES meetings.
[106.40 --> 107.40]  Are you?
[107.40 --> 108.40]  Yeah.
[108.40 --> 110.40]  I'm like, I'm good to go at this point but there's still people.
[110.40 --> 114.40]  Yeah, like I could fill my entire time but I'm still getting emails from people and I'm
[114.40 --> 115.40]  still like.
[115.40 --> 120.40]  Yeah and one of my problems with filling my schedule is like Nick will be like, oh I should
[120.40 --> 121.40]  probably be at that.
[121.40 --> 126.40]  So then like you're scheduled for all the times and then I'm like, well, what?
[126.40 --> 131.40]  Because Nick has to be in like two places at once so then I can't schedule certain things
[131.40 --> 132.40]  and yada yada yada.
[132.40 --> 133.40]  But yeah.
[133.40 --> 134.40]  Oh cool!
[134.40 --> 141.40]  I had someone send a request for us to review the Obato ergonomic workstation.
[141.40 --> 142.40]  Have you heard of this?
[142.40 --> 144.40]  No, but why do they call it Obato?
[144.40 --> 145.40]  Obato.
[145.40 --> 148.40]  Unless that's totally not how you pronounce it.
[148.40 --> 149.40]  Oh probably not.
[149.40 --> 151.40]  It's probably like Obuto or something.
[151.40 --> 152.40]  Obuto, yeah okay.
[152.40 --> 153.40]  Whatever.
[153.40 --> 158.40]  So I reached out to them and they have already confirmed.
[158.40 --> 160.40]  Whoa, so what is it?
[160.40 --> 161.40]  Yeah.
[161.40 --> 162.40]  So they make ergonomic workstations.
[162.40 --> 164.40]  You sit on rocks?
[164.40 --> 165.40]  Oh no.
[165.40 --> 166.40]  Whaaaaa?
[166.40 --> 167.40]  Whoa.
[167.40 --> 170.40]  So I was like, sure.
[170.40 --> 172.40]  Yeah, let's check it out.
[172.40 --> 174.40]  Yeah, these things look freaking awesome.
[174.40 --> 177.40]  That reminds me of the, what was that, like the Space Commander or whatever it's called?
[177.40 --> 180.40]  No, seriously, you sat in the chair and the thing came over your head and the monitor's
[180.40 --> 181.40]  on.
[181.40 --> 182.40]  I remember that thing.
[182.40 --> 183.40]  Yeah, what was it called?
[183.40 --> 184.40]  I don't remember.
[184.40 --> 187.40]  But this, like, not exactly, but the idea kind of reminds me of that.
[187.40 --> 188.40]  That triple monitor one on the right.
[188.40 --> 190.40]  And that chair looks like badass comfortable.
[190.40 --> 191.40]  Yeah, it does.
[191.40 --> 192.40]  I'm liking this.
[192.40 --> 194.40]  Yeah, I wanna try it out.
[194.40 --> 195.40]  It's cool.
[195.40 --> 196.40]  It's a nice, man.
[196.40 --> 198.40]  So the Obuto revolution.
[198.40 --> 199.40]  Obuto.
[199.40 --> 200.40]  Whatever.
[200.40 --> 201.40]  Obuto.
[201.40 --> 202.40]  Obuto yourself.
[202.40 --> 205.40]  I don't know what it's called, but Obuto just sounds wrong.
[205.40 --> 212.40]  Yeah, so in the time we've been doing the show, their HQ said they'd be interested,
[212.40 --> 215.40]  but they'd have to check with their Canadian distributor, and their Canadian distributor
[215.40 --> 216.40]  got back to us.
[216.40 --> 218.40]  With the first word being absolutely.
[218.40 --> 219.40]  Yeah.
[219.40 --> 220.40]  Awesome.
[220.40 --> 221.40]  Absolutely.
[221.40 --> 222.40]  Stoked.
[222.40 --> 223.40]  That's awesome.
[223.40 --> 224.40]  That is freaking awesome.
[224.40 --> 225.40]  I like that a lot, actually.
[225.40 --> 229.40]  Also, we've, uh, I wonder, I wonder, should I, should I leak this?
[229.40 --> 230.40]  No, not yet.
[230.40 --> 231.40]  Not yet?
[231.40 --> 232.40]  You don't think so?
[232.40 --> 233.40]  I don't think yet.
[233.40 --> 234.40]  You can get Nick's input.
[234.40 --> 235.40]  Just in a...
[235.40 --> 236.40]  I think fairly soon.
[236.40 --> 242.40]  Maybe, maybe not the whole thing, but like a, like a, a cursory look at one of the layouts,
[242.40 --> 243.40]  maybe?
[243.40 --> 247.40]  Tell you what, how about I pick the layout that is least likely, but is similar.
[247.40 --> 248.40]  That makes less sense.
[248.40 --> 249.40]  Yeah.
[249.40 --> 250.40]  That makes less sense?
[250.40 --> 252.40]  I would, I would not, and for reasons.
[252.40 --> 253.40]  Let's wait until things are confirmed more.
[253.40 --> 254.40]  Yeah.
[254.40 --> 255.40]  I'll talk to you about it after the show.
[255.40 --> 256.40]  Let's not do it on this show.
[256.40 --> 257.40]  Alright, alright, alright.
[257.40 --> 258.40]  Maybe on...
[258.40 --> 264.40]  Well, we've made a lot of progress on what may be the layout for the new Linus Media Group
[264.40 --> 265.40]  office.
[265.40 --> 268.40]  I wasn't gonna show the whole thing, I was just gonna show the office area.
[268.40 --> 269.40]  Yeah.
[269.40 --> 270.40]  If that makes a difference.
[270.40 --> 271.40]  Apparently it doesn't.
[271.40 --> 272.40]  Alright, fine, whatever.
[272.40 --> 273.40]  Screw you guys.
[273.40 --> 274.40]  Um...
[274.40 --> 275.40]  It's probably okay.
[275.40 --> 277.40]  I just wanna bring up certain things before we do it.
[277.40 --> 278.40]  Oh.
[278.40 --> 280.40]  And I'm sure people will still wanna see it.
[280.40 --> 282.40]  And like, we could show it on the actual show if you wanna show it.
[282.40 --> 285.40]  Yeah, why don't we, why don't we show it on the actual, on the actual show.
[285.40 --> 286.40]  Yeah.
[286.40 --> 290.40]  Cause we can do it, cause we should address, like, what's happening with new office.
[290.40 --> 291.40]  Yeah.
[291.40 --> 292.40]  Right.
[292.40 --> 293.40]  And like, why these decisions are made.
[293.40 --> 294.40]  Yeah.
[294.40 --> 298.40]  And it's funny, a lot of people have been asking, not about new office specifically, but about
[298.40 --> 302.40]  whole room water cooling and the implications of us moving.
[302.40 --> 303.40]  Like...
[303.40 --> 304.40]  Why are you guys just building this now if you're moving?
[304.40 --> 308.40]  I don't understand why you just built this now if you're moving.
[308.40 --> 313.40]  And it's funny because Ed, specifically to address that, started putting the date at the beginning
[313.40 --> 314.40]  of the episode.
[314.40 --> 315.40]  Yeah.
[315.40 --> 316.40]  Like, huge text.
[316.40 --> 319.40]  And now it's, it took you four months to get this done?
[319.40 --> 320.40]  What the heck?
[320.40 --> 322.40]  Nooo, it didn't.
[322.40 --> 323.40]  It didn't.
[323.40 --> 325.40]  I felt so bad for my dad in the last episode.
[325.40 --> 330.40]  And like, all the guys, all the guys that are like, um, this isn't going to work.
[330.40 --> 331.40]  Apparently farmers.
[331.40 --> 332.40]  Yeah.
[332.40 --> 333.40]  This isn't gonna work.
[333.40 --> 334.40]  This isn't gonna work.
[334.40 --> 335.40]  It's totally not gonna work.
[335.40 --> 336.40]  It's stupid.
[336.40 --> 337.40]  It's not gonna work.
[337.40 --> 338.40]  It's been running for months!
[338.40 --> 341.40]  I just love, I just love the people who are like, oh, they didn't plan ahead.
[341.40 --> 344.40]  They should've thought that they were gonna be moving to a new office.
[344.40 --> 348.40]  It's like, we obviously wanted to do this for the sake of the content as much as we wanted
[348.40 --> 349.40]  to do it for the sake of doing it.
[349.40 --> 351.40]  It's like, we are a video production company.
[351.40 --> 352.40]  Yeah.
[352.40 --> 354.40]  And like, it costs so much money, why would you do this?
[354.40 --> 356.40]  I was like, it's clearly sponsored!
[356.40 --> 357.40]  AHHHHH!
[357.40 --> 362.40]  We definitely bought all of those products, Luke.
[362.40 --> 363.40]  Yeah.
[363.40 --> 368.40]  We definitely bought like, Master Cartons on GTX Titan Blacks.
[368.40 --> 369.40]  Yeah!
[369.40 --> 372.40]  Because those are listed on Amazon.com.
[372.40 --> 373.40]  Because that's possible, yeah.
[373.40 --> 375.40]  Yeah, without retail boxes.
[375.40 --> 376.40]  Yeah.
[376.40 --> 377.40]  God.
[377.40 --> 380.40]  People are like, oh, they're spending so much on this.
[380.40 --> 381.40]  Actually, okay.
[381.40 --> 389.40]  We did not quite recoup in like, in like Google AdSense money what we spent on the project.
[389.40 --> 390.40]  Yeah.
[390.40 --> 392.40]  Especially if we factor in the hours that we worked on it.
[392.40 --> 396.40]  But, but, we did get new workstations out of it.
[396.40 --> 399.40]  That has a cost associated with it, even for us.
[399.40 --> 400.40]  So, we did get new workstations out of it.
[400.40 --> 402.40]  And it's been running for months.
[402.40 --> 405.40]  And at this company, that's quite a bit of time.
[405.40 --> 406.40]  Yep.
[406.40 --> 408.40]  And it's cut down on rendering time by a huge amount.
[408.40 --> 409.40]  Yes.
[409.40 --> 410.40]  Which is very valuable.
[410.40 --> 414.40]  It's got bad ass workstations now, which does save us time, which effectively saves us money.
[414.40 --> 417.40]  And, it got people really stoked for like...
[417.40 --> 418.40]  But does it shave us time?
[418.40 --> 419.40]  Yeah, shave us time.
[419.40 --> 420.40]  Oh, dude.
[420.40 --> 421.40]  Shhh.
[421.40 --> 424.40]  And it got people stoked and coming back and watching content.
[424.40 --> 431.40]  And that has, that has an impact for our business on a lot more than just the individual views
[431.40 --> 435.40]  on those videos and the like couple hundred dollars of Google AdSense money or whatever
[435.40 --> 436.40]  that we make from them.
[436.40 --> 441.40]  Because what I've noticed over the last little bit, and there's a really great video.
[441.40 --> 444.40]  Like it, there wasn't anything groundbreaking in this for me.
[444.40 --> 445.40]  But, um...
[445.40 --> 448.40]  Was it the one that Marques shared?
[448.40 --> 449.40]  No.
[449.40 --> 450.40]  Okay.
[450.40 --> 453.40]  By the way, we should check these out because these are what I was talking about.
[453.40 --> 454.40]  Okay.
[454.40 --> 455.40]  I'll, I'll show that in a second.
[455.40 --> 456.40]  So...
[456.40 --> 461.40]  By the way, semi on topic, I was actually looking at this today from that like spreadsheet
[461.40 --> 462.40]  that I've been keeping.
[462.40 --> 467.40]  We're averaging 20,000 views per video higher than we were a month ago.
[467.40 --> 470.40]  Like in the last 30 days than the previous 30 days.
[470.40 --> 473.40]  So this video right here from, uh, from the Game Theorists.
[473.40 --> 475.40]  I'm just gonna go ahead and post it in the chat.
[475.40 --> 476.40]  Really cool channel, by the way.
[476.40 --> 477.40]  Yep.
[477.40 --> 478.40]  Very cool channel.
[478.40 --> 480.40]  I kinda, I know they've been around for a long time and I've seen some of their stuff
[480.40 --> 483.40]  but I've ignored it and just started watching them like crazy lately.
[483.40 --> 489.40]  It's about the importance of your viewers actually watching your videos for their subscription
[489.40 --> 492.40]  box to deliver your content to them.
[492.40 --> 499.40]  So what we've seen from creating this, what is, as you guys have observed, incredibly expensive
[499.40 --> 502.40]  for us content like whole room water cooling.
[502.40 --> 507.40]  The benefit to us has been that you guys are coming back and watching it more regularly,
[507.40 --> 512.40]  which is keeping you from being blocked as a subscriber from our content feed.
[512.40 --> 516.40]  Because being a subscriber does not mean that you get everything as you will see in that video.
[516.40 --> 517.40]  Yeah.
[517.40 --> 519.40]  Apparently the link is not working.
[519.40 --> 520.40]  This video is unavailable.
[520.40 --> 521.40]  What?
[521.40 --> 523.40]  I just pulled that right off the video.
[523.40 --> 524.40]  Yeah, you did.
[524.40 --> 526.40]  If you just look up the Game Theorists, uh...
[526.40 --> 529.40]  Game Theory Subbox Broken.
[529.40 --> 531.40]  Here, I'll just post it here.
[531.40 --> 533.40]  I'll just post the title of the video.
[533.40 --> 534.40]  Yeah.
[534.40 --> 535.40]  We'll make life easy.
[535.40 --> 539.40]  It has, and I know PewDiePie is in the title, it has very little to do with PewDiePie.
[539.40 --> 540.40]  Yeah.
[540.40 --> 541.40]  So don't worry about that.
[541.40 --> 542.40]  There.
[542.40 --> 544.40]  Just the video was sparked because of something that he said.
[544.40 --> 545.40]  That's about it.
[545.40 --> 547.40]  Yeah, so it's had that benefit for us.
[547.40 --> 552.40]  Like, we've seen better viewership overall because the people who sign up to have our videos delivered to them
[552.40 --> 555.40]  seem to be actually getting them, which is really great.
[555.40 --> 561.40]  And actually, we've got plans for some other, like, really exciting new content segment type stuff
[561.40 --> 564.40]  that'll be, again, serialized content.
[564.40 --> 570.40]  But what we are committed to internally to not doing to you guys again is making you wait four months for something
[570.40 --> 572.40]  before we actually start to release it.
[572.40 --> 573.40]  So...
[573.40 --> 575.40]  If you guys have noticed, the motherboard videos were coming out pretty quick.
[575.40 --> 578.40]  They're gonna have to take a little pause because it's CES, but I think that's understandable.
[578.40 --> 581.40]  And then we'll hit the next two pretty quickly once we get back.
[581.40 --> 583.40]  Yep, and we pulled things together on mineral oil.
[583.40 --> 588.40]  Mineral oil's parts one to four all came out within, I think it was about a five-week span.
[588.40 --> 591.40]  And one to two was a pretty big gap, and then it was boop, boop, boop.
[591.40 --> 592.40]  And then it was one week, one week, one week.
[592.40 --> 597.40]  Yep, and the same thing, whole room water cooling, we've been rolling out an update almost every week.
[597.40 --> 604.40]  Like, we've, um, I think we've started to demonstrate to you guys, I hope, that we're taking the additional resources we have
[604.40 --> 608.40]  and we're dumping it back into the channel to bring you guys this better content.
[608.40 --> 613.40]  And I've had people complain, like, you know, why didn't you do something like, uh, curved surround
[613.40 --> 615.40]  or something like oil cooled as one video?
[615.40 --> 621.40]  Why are you spreading it out over four videos with sort of the cynical viewpoint being that we just wanted more views?
[621.40 --> 626.40]  Truthfully, those views don't actually add up to a lot of money for us.
[626.40 --> 627.40]  It's not about that.
[627.40 --> 632.40]  It's about that those videos are incredibly expensive and time-consuming for us to make.
[632.40 --> 640.40]  So for us to turn the entire mineral oil project into one video would all of a sudden be three other days that week that we can't make a video.
[640.40 --> 641.40]  So we have to spread it out.
[641.40 --> 646.40]  And it would have been incredibly long if you wanted all that content in one video, which is going to be hard to digest probably.
[646.40 --> 656.40]  And there's going to be the hardcores out there, the guys that just sat through the WAN show and are now watching After Party, all 6,500 of you, that would watch that 40 minute video.
[656.40 --> 659.40]  But we have to appeal to other people too.
[659.40 --> 672.40]  So, you know, if, if, and, and we, like, we love your guys' dedication, but if we only had 6,500 people watch every video, then we wouldn't even be able to afford to maintain our staff.
[672.40 --> 676.40]  And we'd have to start downsizing and downscaling.
[676.40 --> 677.40]  Nope.
[677.40 --> 678.40]  Yeah.
[678.40 --> 680.40]  So that would be, so that would be that.
[680.40 --> 682.40]  That would be it for Linus Tech Tips as we know it.
[682.40 --> 695.40]  So, yeah, I mean, everything we do here, I think we do with a sound sort of business plan in place, but not for the sake of compromising the content that you guys want to see.
[695.40 --> 705.40]  And I think, I think either we've demonstrated lately that we're delivering great content or you guys have demonstrated lately that you have a bigger appetite for our not as good content.
[705.40 --> 708.40]  One of those two things happened and I hope it's the former.
[708.40 --> 710.40]  I think it's, I think it's better.
[710.40 --> 713.40]  I don't think anyone's actually complaining about the content being bad.
[713.40 --> 714.40]  It's just the interval stuff.
[714.40 --> 719.40]  And I know that all started from us taking way too long on a few things like mineral oil one versus mineral oil two.
[719.40 --> 724.40]  And teasing whole room and then not releasing any videos about it for months.
[724.40 --> 726.40]  But the thing is, we didn't want to spoil it.
[726.40 --> 731.40]  We knew we had all this great footage and we were going to be able to release these great videos.
[731.40 --> 739.40]  But I don't think people understand that every single one of those mineral, of those whole room videos took about a week for an editor.
[739.40 --> 740.40]  A week.
[740.40 --> 742.40]  There's a lot of footage to go through.
[742.40 --> 747.40]  And then there's that like cool kind of material design graphic stuff that he's doing too.
[747.40 --> 748.40]  Yup.
[748.40 --> 760.40]  And not just a week of any editor, a week of Ed, who is our best editor in terms of, like I shouldn't say, okay best isn't really fair because everyone has a bit of a different sort of skill set.
[760.40 --> 768.40]  But Ed's strength is that motion graphics and that design, that artfulness to it.
[768.40 --> 774.40]  Like I'd say, I think Burkle is probably right up there in terms of comedic timing.
[774.40 --> 775.40]  Like if he wants-
[775.40 --> 778.40]  I was going to say, very different skill sets.
[778.40 --> 779.40]  Yeah.
[779.40 --> 780.40]  And-
[780.40 --> 783.40]  You can have like cats going behind you on motorbikes and stuff.
[783.40 --> 784.40]  Yes.
[784.40 --> 785.40]  Rats.
[785.40 --> 786.40]  Rats, whatever.
[786.40 --> 792.40]  Like, and so, and then Ed, or excuse me, um, and then Taren is like a machine.
[792.40 --> 794.40]  He's our fastest editor by far.
[794.40 --> 805.40]  So like everyone has their own strengths, but it tied up Ed, who is our main design guy, which means that we haven't been able to redo the Linus Tech Tips intro, something I've wanted to do for a while.
[805.40 --> 809.40]  We haven't been able to, um, do many shirt designs.
[809.40 --> 810.40]  We haven't been able to do-
[810.40 --> 812.40]  Fix certain graphics for WAN shows and stuff.
[812.40 --> 813.40]  Yeah.
[813.40 --> 814.40]  Like there's a lot-
[814.40 --> 815.40]  I haven't had a current rate card in a while.
[815.40 --> 816.40]  Yeah.
[816.40 --> 817.40]  We haven't had a-
[817.40 --> 821.40]  It took me a month and a half to get a graphic for the forum, which we're not even going to be using anymore.
[821.40 --> 822.40]  Oh my god.
[822.40 --> 833.40]  So yeah, we've just, like, we've been set behind because we couldn't afford Ed because we had injuries and other people on holiday, so we couldn't afford to have him work on whole room water cooling.
[833.40 --> 839.40]  And then even all this other stuff that we need to do has been on hold because he's been completely tied up on whole room water cooling.
[839.40 --> 848.40]  Like basically, if we're going to add that to the cost of making whole room water cooling, basically I paid someone for an entire month just to make those four videos.
[848.40 --> 854.40]  Just because we think it's really great content and we think that people will get excited about it and enjoy watching it.
[854.40 --> 857.40]  Like we lost money on whole room if we don't factor in-
[857.40 --> 859.40]  I think even if we factor in the workstations.
[860.40 --> 863.40]  All the hours of the people working on it for four days?
[863.40 --> 864.40]  Yeah, quite a lot.
[864.40 --> 870.40]  We tied up the entire company for a week and tied up an editor for a month.
[870.40 --> 873.40]  It did, like, uh, you also have to calculate in the positive though.
[873.40 --> 881.40]  Because there's faster rendering, the increased view count on things, systems aren't overheating anymore.
[881.40 --> 884.40]  Right, but if we just look at it from strictly dollars and cents.
[884.40 --> 885.40]  Yes, yeah.
[885.40 --> 888.40]  And, like, you could say those workstations are worth a lot.
[888.40 --> 890.40]  Like, they have Titans and they have Extreme Editions in them.
[890.40 --> 894.40]  But if we were building our own workstations, we would put 49-
[894.40 --> 895.40]  We didn't even ask for Titans.
[895.40 --> 896.40]  Yeah, we didn't even ask for Titans.
[896.40 --> 904.40]  We would put 4930Ks in and maybe, like, low-end Quadros with an additional CUDA card that we would pull out of our review sample inventory.
[904.40 --> 905.40]  Like-
[905.40 --> 906.40]  That's what we've done in the past.
[906.40 --> 907.40]  That's what we've done in the past.
[907.40 --> 908.40]  That's what we would have done.
[908.40 --> 912.40]  So, if we hadn't had those, they wouldn't have been quite that expensive.
[912.40 --> 916.40]  I'd say we probably narrowly lost money on the whole thing.
[916.40 --> 917.40]  But that's fine.
[917.40 --> 921.40]  Because we want to invest in making really cool content.
[921.40 --> 923.40]  And I think it's really cool.
[923.40 --> 925.40]  I think it's some of the best we've ever made.
[925.40 --> 926.40]  Yeah, yeah.
[926.40 --> 927.40]  I completely agree.
[927.40 --> 931.40]  I'm super stoked on how well oil's doing as well.
[931.40 --> 934.40]  Everyone got really excited about oil.
[934.40 --> 945.40]  And one thing that I hope it does, because the original, like, slick PC oil video thing did this, is just keeps getting views.
[945.40 --> 946.40]  Yeah.
[946.40 --> 948.40]  Because, I don't know, I really like the mineral idea.
[948.40 --> 955.40]  I am, to my very core, pissed off that Pudgett got screwed up, screwed over.
[955.40 --> 961.40]  But I'm happy that, regardless of that, people are still interested in it, still carrying on.
[961.40 --> 963.40]  Oh, I should probably say-
[963.40 --> 964.40]  That's on purpose.
[964.40 --> 965.40]  Okay.
[965.40 --> 967.40]  The mineral oil giveaways are still going on.
[967.40 --> 968.40]  Oh!
[968.40 --> 974.40]  We've gone through, like, two rounds of winners and people just don't respond or aren't willing to commit.
[974.40 --> 978.40]  So, it's not going to be done in the next week, but there will be people-
[978.40 --> 987.40]  I think people are going to appreciate that it's not only going to people that are actually responding, so we're not just bailing real quick, but also that it's going to people that will actually use it.
[987.40 --> 988.40]  So-
[988.40 --> 991.40]  Yeah, like, we're being very sure that people are going to use it.
[991.40 --> 992.40]  Good.
[992.40 --> 993.40]  And so far, just people aren't committing.
[993.40 --> 997.40]  So, it's still happening, just delayed.
[997.40 --> 998.40]  I'd do it.
[998.40 --> 1001.40]  Too bad I can't win.
[1001.40 --> 1002.40]  Tell you what, tell you what.
[1002.40 --> 1007.40]  If we go through two more rounds, then you can stack one for him.
[1007.40 --> 1008.40]  No.
[1008.40 --> 1009.40]  No?
[1009.40 --> 1010.40]  No!
[1010.40 --> 1011.40]  No!
[1011.40 --> 1012.40]  Screw you!
[1012.40 --> 1014.40]  I would buy that oil immediately.
[1014.40 --> 1016.40]  I have no problem with that.
[1016.40 --> 1017.40]  You wouldn't buy the oil?
[1017.40 --> 1019.40]  You'd steal it from me.
[1019.40 --> 1022.40]  But I'd be able to get a receipt for it.
[1022.40 --> 1024.40]  I'm going to need a proof of purchase for that oil.
[1024.40 --> 1025.40]  We had to purchase it!
[1025.40 --> 1027.40]  I would be able to get you a proof of purchase.
[1027.40 --> 1028.40]  You can't get my receipt.
[1028.40 --> 1030.40]  No, I'm going to make you buy your own oil.
[1030.40 --> 1031.40]  I'm going to need your receipt.
[1031.40 --> 1032.40]  Buy your own oil, bitch!
[1032.40 --> 1035.40]  That's such a waste!
[1035.40 --> 1037.40]  There's all that oil sitting right there.
[1037.40 --> 1039.40]  I'm not going to do anything with it.
[1039.40 --> 1042.40]  Minus just wants to bathe in that sweet, sweet mineral oil.
[1042.40 --> 1044.40]  Ew, that is disgusting.
[1044.40 --> 1046.40]  That's really gross.
[1046.40 --> 1047.40]  That's horrible.
[1047.40 --> 1050.40]  I-I-aww.
[1050.40 --> 1052.40]  That sweet, sweet mineral oil.
[1052.40 --> 1053.40]  That was exactly my plan.
[1053.40 --> 1055.40]  I was just going to try and dig up the receipt for that oil.
[1055.40 --> 1058.40]  Oh, I thought you were going to say I was just going to try and bathe in it.
[1058.40 --> 1059.40]  No, no.
[1059.40 --> 1060.40]  That's-
[1060.40 --> 1064.40]  But I would still buy oil if it came down to my possibility.
[1064.40 --> 1065.40]  But then, yeah, I don't know.
[1065.40 --> 1072.40]  So the videos we have coming this weekend, speaking of just A content all the time, man,
[1072.40 --> 1073.40]  it's been-it's incredible.
[1073.40 --> 1077.40]  The more resources we add, it's not like-because I was talking to Brandon about this.
[1077.40 --> 1085.40]  Like if we had all the people that we have working here, and if we still did Linus Tech Tips the way that we used to, with like one take on boxings-
[1085.40 --> 1086.40]  Yeah.
[1086.40 --> 1088.40]  Imagine how it was more-
[1088.40 --> 1091.40]  Dude, we used to do a week of Linus Tech Tips in like two hours.
[1091.40 --> 1092.40]  Yeah.
[1092.40 --> 1099.40]  So we could shoot and edit all of our videos for the week in like a day, and then we could just sit on ass playing video games for the rest of the week.
[1099.40 --> 1103.40]  Maybe we should just do it.
[1103.40 --> 1108.40]  We could do it faster than that because I could host some and you could host some.
[1108.40 --> 1110.40]  Right, we didn't even have two hosts before.
[1110.40 --> 1111.40]  Sure, we could do it like half a day.
[1111.40 --> 1113.40]  Double releases once every 12 hours.
[1113.40 --> 1120.40]  So what I'm thinking is maybe we have like a month every year where we do like old school month.
[1120.40 --> 1124.40]  And we just stream video games all day.
[1124.40 --> 1128.40]  Yeah, so we just completely phone it in for a month.
[1128.40 --> 1131.40]  No, we can't do that.
[1131.40 --> 1133.40]  We'll have to do it in like February or something.
[1133.40 --> 1136.40]  Well, it could be like big project month, kind of.
[1136.40 --> 1141.40]  And we could do like skit stuff during that time, we could work on better development for new channels.
[1141.40 --> 1143.40]  No, I plan to just add more resources.
[1143.40 --> 1144.40]  I want to add more writing.
[1144.40 --> 1145.40]  I know, I'm just-
[1145.40 --> 1150.40]  I want to add more writing, I want to add more sales so that we can continue to support these additional people.
[1150.40 --> 1152.40]  Like, I mean, I want Linus-
[1152.40 --> 1157.40]  The best part is the entire Twitch chat just freaked out asking for us to do it.
[1157.40 --> 1158.40]  Okay, hold on.
[1158.40 --> 1159.40]  Old school month.
[1159.40 --> 1160.40]  Hold on.
[1160.40 --> 1162.40]  I have a compromise for you guys.
[1162.40 --> 1171.40]  What I'm actually thinking that we might do into the new year is instead of having like old school unboxing month, which is kind of like excessive.
[1171.40 --> 1172.40]  That was crazy.
[1172.40 --> 1178.40]  I was thinking just like we used to have an unboxing every day and then we added WAN show and that took over the Friday slot.
[1178.40 --> 1179.40]  Yeah.
[1179.40 --> 1182.40]  What I'm thinking is maybe we'll add like old school unboxing Mondays.
[1182.40 --> 1183.40]  Throwback Thursday.
[1183.40 --> 1184.40]  Throwback Thursday.
[1184.40 --> 1185.40]  But it's unboxings.
[1185.40 --> 1190.40]  I don't like the idea of having unboxings and WAN show right next to each other.
[1190.40 --> 1192.40]  I was just, I don't even, I was, yeah.
[1192.40 --> 1193.40]  Okay, well, whatever.
[1193.40 --> 1194.40]  Just the naming made sense.
[1194.40 --> 1195.40]  It doesn't matter.
[1195.40 --> 1196.40]  It could be Throwback Tuesday.
[1196.40 --> 1197.40]  Sure.
[1197.40 --> 1199.40]  Which doesn't alliterate as well, but whatever.
[1199.40 --> 1200.40]  Whatever.
[1200.40 --> 1203.40]  It's just, no, it's cause, what is it, TBT or something?
[1203.40 --> 1204.40]  That's already a thing.
[1204.40 --> 1205.40]  Oh.
[1205.40 --> 1206.40]  That's the only reason why I said that.
[1206.40 --> 1207.40]  Yeah, no, I don't actually care at all.
[1207.40 --> 1208.40]  I'm showing my ignorance here.
[1208.40 --> 1210.40]  It's some stupid hashtag or something.
[1210.40 --> 1211.40]  Yeah.
[1211.40 --> 1212.40]  Yeah.
[1212.40 --> 1213.40]  Anyways, whatever.
[1213.40 --> 1214.40]  Don't worry about it.
[1214.40 --> 1219.40]  But anyway, so the point is, I'm thinking of adding like an unboxing day.
[1219.40 --> 1221.40]  So we do it as a weekly segment.
[1221.40 --> 1222.40]  UBM.
[1222.40 --> 1223.40]  Unboxing Monday.
[1223.40 --> 1227.40]  And then what I'd like to do over the course of this coming year is actually segmentize
[1227.40 --> 1229.40]  a lot of what we do.
[1229.40 --> 1234.40]  So like maybe Saturday, you guys can expect the follow up for whatever our ongoing big
[1234.40 --> 1235.40]  project is.
[1235.40 --> 1236.40]  Oh.
[1236.40 --> 1238.40]  And then on Fridays, you know you're getting WAN show.
[1238.40 --> 1241.40]  And then on Tuesdays, you know you're getting an unboxing.
[1241.40 --> 1245.40]  And then Wednesdays is review and then Sunday is like big review.
[1245.40 --> 1252.40]  So anyway, this weekend the content is going to be my Nexus 6 review and something else.
[1252.40 --> 1253.40]  Right.
[1253.40 --> 1256.40]  And then the iMac software impressions.
[1256.40 --> 1259.40]  So my impressions having used OS X for over a month.
[1259.40 --> 1262.40]  And then we hit CES madness, I think.
[1262.40 --> 1263.40]  Yep.
[1263.40 --> 1264.40]  Then we hit CES.
[1264.40 --> 1266.40]  My Tuesdays insanity.
[1266.40 --> 1271.40]  I might be able to get like all of the content actually required for the whole trip done
[1271.40 --> 1272.40]  on Tuesday.
[1272.40 --> 1275.40]  If I'm looking at like my schedule right now.
[1275.40 --> 1277.40]  I was like wow, okay.
[1277.40 --> 1279.40]  It's going to be a crazy trip.
[1279.40 --> 1282.40]  I'm hoping to do like a channel super fun while we're down there.
[1282.40 --> 1283.40]  Like we could just...
[1283.40 --> 1285.40]  With a special guest.
[1285.40 --> 1286.40]  Or something.
[1286.40 --> 1288.40]  Yeah, we could have some fun.
[1288.40 --> 1289.40]  We'll do like a channel super fun.
[1289.40 --> 1291.40]  Or maybe even two while we're down there and we'll...
[1291.40 --> 1293.40]  Did we get a super fun done today?
[1293.40 --> 1294.40]  Is it edited?
[1294.40 --> 1296.40]  He is editing.
[1296.40 --> 1298.40]  Oh, I hear him talking.
[1298.40 --> 1299.40]  Oh, okay.
[1299.40 --> 1302.40]  Okay, so I think we'll have a super fun for this weekend.
[1302.40 --> 1303.40]  Yeah.
[1303.40 --> 1304.40]  I'm actually not in this one.
[1304.40 --> 1306.40]  I'm actually excited to watch it.
[1306.40 --> 1309.40]  Yeah, this is the beginning of a thing.
[1309.40 --> 1310.40]  I don't know...
[1310.40 --> 1312.40]  The beginning of an ultimate showdown.
[1312.40 --> 1313.40]  Yeah.
[1313.40 --> 1314.40]  On Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[1314.40 --> 1315.40]  Yeah, let's just spill the beans.
[1315.40 --> 1316.40]  It's the after party guys.
[1316.40 --> 1317.40]  Yeah, it's the after party guys.
[1317.40 --> 1318.40]  Whatever.
[1318.40 --> 1321.40]  So we're starting a new segment called Nick vs. Nick.
[1321.40 --> 1327.40]  And whoever wins, I think the stakes are that they earn the right to have the name Nick.
[1327.40 --> 1331.40]  And the other one has to go by their last name until the next challenge.
[1331.40 --> 1332.40]  For the week.
[1332.40 --> 1333.40]  For the week.
[1333.40 --> 1334.40]  Yeah.
[1334.40 --> 1335.40]  That's awesome.
[1335.40 --> 1336.40]  I didn't know that was a thing.
[1336.40 --> 1337.40]  Yeah.
[1337.40 --> 1338.40]  That's super...
[1338.40 --> 1340.40]  I'm so down to just flip back and forth for that.
[1340.40 --> 1341.40]  I will train myself to learn my names.
[1341.40 --> 1343.40]  You guys will find out who's gonna be...
[1343.40 --> 1344.40]  Who's gonna be Nick.
[1344.40 --> 1345.40]  Who's gonna be Nick.
[1345.40 --> 1346.40]  And Nick Supreme.
[1346.40 --> 1349.40]  Who's gonna have to be Burkle or Light.
[1349.40 --> 1351.40]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1351.40 --> 1352.40]  You have to earn...
[1352.40 --> 1353.40]  That's how Linus Media Group works.
[1353.40 --> 1355.40]  You have to earn the right to use your name.
[1355.40 --> 1360.40]  So we're maintaining almost 7,000 people for after party.
[1360.40 --> 1361.40]  I know, this is ridiculous.
[1361.40 --> 1362.40]  Ridiculous.
[1362.40 --> 1364.40]  I like the after party segments.
[1364.40 --> 1367.40]  We front paged on Twitch, but I think you guys usually front page on Twitch.
[1367.40 --> 1368.40]  I never saw it.
[1368.40 --> 1370.40]  I checked multiple times and never saw it.
[1370.40 --> 1371.40]  People said you were front paging.
[1371.40 --> 1376.40]  Somebody was posting like a PCMR thread, but I was pretty deep in PCMR.
[1376.40 --> 1377.40]  Interesting.
[1377.40 --> 1380.40]  Yeah, PCMR like kind of likes us.
[1380.40 --> 1381.40]  Or they kind of don't sometimes.
[1381.40 --> 1383.40]  People are cheering for Nick.
[1384.40 --> 1385.40]  Go Nick!
[1385.40 --> 1386.40]  Which one?
[1388.40 --> 1390.40]  We need to do a shirt for that.
[1391.40 --> 1392.40]  Go Nick!
[1392.40 --> 1394.40]  People be like, do you mean Nick's?
[1394.40 --> 1395.40]  No!
[1395.40 --> 1396.40]  Just Nick!
[1396.40 --> 1398.40]  So like, get character faces for them?
[1398.40 --> 1399.40]  And it's like, go Nick.
[1399.40 --> 1401.40]  And it's like, Nick!
[1401.40 --> 1402.40]  Nick!
[1403.40 --> 1404.40]  Wait, what?
[1404.40 --> 1405.40]  Oh man.
[1405.40 --> 1407.40]  Or just our heads.
[1407.40 --> 1408.40]  Head versus head.
[1409.40 --> 1410.40]  Mmm.
[1411.40 --> 1412.40]  That kind of works.
[1412.40 --> 1415.40]  I don't think they have competitions for that.
[1416.40 --> 1417.40]  Little do you know.
[1417.40 --> 1418.40]  Maybe...
[1418.40 --> 1419.40]  Oh.
[1419.40 --> 1420.40]  Alright then.
[1420.40 --> 1422.40]  Maybe in insert location here.
[1422.40 --> 1424.40]  I don't really know what to say.
[1424.40 --> 1425.40]  Insert what?
[1425.40 --> 1426.40]  Sorry.
[1426.40 --> 1427.40]  What where?
[1427.40 --> 1428.40]  Insert location here.
[1428.40 --> 1429.40]  Oh, okay.
[1429.40 --> 1430.40]  I thought I heard something else for location.
[1430.40 --> 1432.40]  I don't want to segment anyone.
[1432.40 --> 1434.40]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1434.40 --> 1435.40]  We've...
[1435.40 --> 1436.40]  So yeah, so anyway.
[1436.40 --> 1438.40]  So we're doing that whole thing this weekend.
[1438.40 --> 1441.40]  Where we're doing like, our marquee review on the Sunday, I think.
[1441.40 --> 1442.40]  Is next to 6th Sunday?
[1442.40 --> 1443.40]  Yeah.
[1443.40 --> 1448.40]  Yeah, and then we're doing our continuing, like, ongoing serialized content follow up on the Saturday.
[1448.40 --> 1451.40]  And it seems to be working really well.
[1451.40 --> 1456.40]  Like, it used to be, when I looked at our top 10 videos over the last month, it would actually
[1456.40 --> 1461.40]  usually be older videos, like fire truck or a build guide or whatever else.
[1461.40 --> 1472.40]  But for the last month, our top 10 videos are Mineral Oil Part 3, Whole Room Part 2, Whole Room Part 1, 4K gaming PC under 1000, which is part of our new build log segment.
[1472.40 --> 1477.40]  Mineral Oil Part 4, How to Build Ultimate Silent Gaming PC.
[1477.40 --> 1480.40]  So it was a build guide that we released very recently.
[1480.40 --> 1484.40]  Whole Room Part 3, iMac hardware upgrade.
[1484.40 --> 1489.40]  Would you buy a $1000 wireless router and EVGA GTX 980 classified review.
[1489.40 --> 1490.40]  Wow.
[1490.40 --> 1491.40]  It's all new stuff.
[1491.40 --> 1498.40]  So the last two are the only ones that are older style content where it was product reviews.
[1498.40 --> 1500.40]  Isn't that incredible?
[1500.40 --> 1501.40]  That's really interesting.
[1501.40 --> 1502.40]  All of our most...
[1502.40 --> 1504.40]  And we're also totally not abandoning product reviews.
[1504.40 --> 1505.40]  No.
[1505.40 --> 1506.40]  That's not going away.
[1506.40 --> 1509.40]  He's just saying older style content, which we're still doing.
[1509.40 --> 1514.40]  The thing is that we have to address that there's not as much to do.
[1514.40 --> 1515.40]  Yeah.
[1515.40 --> 1516.40]  That's a big problem.
[1516.40 --> 1520.40]  Like it used to be we had a new graphics card rolling out every six months to talk to you guys about.
[1520.40 --> 1521.40]  It was beastly.
[1521.40 --> 1522.40]  I mean...
[1522.40 --> 1523.40]  Yeah.
[1523.40 --> 1524.40]  The way...
[1524.40 --> 1525.40]  That's right.
[1525.40 --> 1528.40]  The way it is now, anyone who bought on our...
[1528.40 --> 1529.40]  Okay.
[1529.40 --> 1537.40]  Anyone who bought an HD 7970 still has a current like $250, $300 graphics card.
[1537.40 --> 1542.40]  Well, back in the garage, like looking at beginning of Linus Meteor Group, I had my crazy Titan week.
[1542.40 --> 1543.40]  Yeah.
[1543.40 --> 1546.40]  In crazy Titan week, there was like 780s now.
[1546.40 --> 1550.40]  And anyone who bought a Titan is like still...
[1550.40 --> 1553.40]  Totally, definitely super good.
[1553.40 --> 1559.40]  So GTX 980 is a $600 graphics card and a Titan is like 80% of the performance.
[1559.40 --> 1562.40]  Overclocked, can match it for performance pretty much.
[1562.40 --> 1565.40]  You're still kind of sitting okay.
[1565.40 --> 1567.40]  What are we supposed to review?
[1567.40 --> 1568.40]  Yeah.
[1568.40 --> 1572.40]  We can't do motherboards and power supplies all day because as much as some people find that interesting,
[1572.40 --> 1575.40]  most people are not interested in a particular model.
[1575.40 --> 1581.40]  So if we adapt our content to like round ups and showdowns, it's a lot more work on our side.
[1581.40 --> 1584.40]  But I think we're delivering you guys something better anyway.
[1584.40 --> 1587.40]  And that seems to be what a lot of people kind of agree with.
[1587.40 --> 1588.40]  Yeah.
[1588.40 --> 1594.40]  And I mean, especially in a showdown like what you're doing where it's four motherboards and we're stretching it out into four videos for the showdown.
[1594.40 --> 1600.40]  Well, that makes sense because we would have had to do four individual motherboard videos anyway and we wouldn't have been able to compare them as effectively.
[1600.40 --> 1611.40]  And one thing that some people seem to be totally getting and some people aren't as much is that, and you brought this up earlier, Ashley, is that it's not just specifically about those motherboards.
[1611.40 --> 1616.40]  It's kind of about those brands and those brand ideas and like what that brand might do in other segments.
[1616.40 --> 1617.40]  The landscape of that price point.
[1617.40 --> 1618.40]  The landscape of that price point.
[1618.40 --> 1623.40]  The idea of shopping for a motherboard and all that kind of stuff.
[1623.40 --> 1624.40]  What we should be looking at.
[1624.40 --> 1625.40]  Yes.
[1625.40 --> 1637.40]  And like what we see as common and what kind of things to bring up because say you're a new kind of system builder and you're like that dude that everyone in your high school or university or whatever goes to to build computers for.
[1637.40 --> 1638.40]  What should you be talking about?
[1638.40 --> 1644.40]  Sometimes you know the right idea but making it make sense might not be super easy.
[1644.40 --> 1651.40]  Yeah, and sometimes even if you know everything we said in those videos it might just be useful fodder to link people to.
[1651.40 --> 1652.40]  Just throw at people.
[1652.40 --> 1654.40]  That's the whole idea of TechWiki basically.
[1654.40 --> 1655.40]  Yeah.
[1655.40 --> 1662.40]  Is even if you didn't know it, you watch the video and then you do know it and then instead of regurgitating everything you can just send someone a video.
[1662.40 --> 1663.40]  That's awesome.
[1663.40 --> 1665.40]  Oh, is it?
[1665.40 --> 1666.40]  What's it about?
[1666.40 --> 1667.40]  Say it Express.
[1667.40 --> 1668.40]  Oh right, Say it Express.
[1668.40 --> 1669.40]  Cool.
[1669.40 --> 1670.40]  That's good.
[1670.40 --> 1672.40]  Yeah, TechWiki's been on fire lately.
[1672.40 --> 1673.40]  Every single video.
[1673.40 --> 1674.40]  We're over 410,000.
[1674.40 --> 1675.40]  Sorry?
[1675.40 --> 1676.40]  We're over 410,000.
[1676.40 --> 1677.40]  That's insanity.
[1677.40 --> 1678.40]  It's ridiculous.
[1678.40 --> 1679.40]  It's so crazy.
[1679.40 --> 1680.40]  It's our second channel.
[1680.40 --> 1681.40]  I know.
[1681.40 --> 1683.40]  It's like twice as big as Linus Tech Tips when I joined.
[1683.40 --> 1684.40]  Yep.
[1684.40 --> 1685.40]  What's Superfund at?
[1685.40 --> 1686.40]  Like 70?
[1686.40 --> 1687.40]  Uh...
[1687.40 --> 1690.40]  Superfund's growing a lot faster than it used to though.
[1690.40 --> 1691.40]  It's growing like 400 a day.
[1691.40 --> 1692.40]  Well that's because we're actually creating content.
[1692.40 --> 1694.40]  We stopped for a while which was not good.
[1694.40 --> 1699.40]  But like TechQuiki I think is growing subscriber wise as quickly as Linus Tech Tips is right now.
[1699.40 --> 1701.40]  No, Linus Tech Tips has taken off lately.
[1701.40 --> 1704.40]  Linus Tech Tips cracked 2,000 a day over the last month.
[1704.40 --> 1705.40]  Yeah, yeah.
[1705.40 --> 1709.40]  We're hitting like, dude, our view and subscriber total for the last few months is ridiculous.
[1709.40 --> 1710.40]  I know.
[1710.40 --> 1711.40]  Yeah.
[1711.40 --> 1716.40]  Like I said, within the first 24 hours we're getting 20,000 more views in the last 30 days
[1716.40 --> 1719.40]  than we did in the previous 30 days.
[1719.40 --> 1720.40]  20,000.
[1720.40 --> 1721.40]  That's crazy.
[1721.40 --> 1722.40]  That's like 15%.
[1722.40 --> 1723.40]  That's crazy, bruh.
[1723.40 --> 1724.40]  It's like an increase of 15%.
[1724.40 --> 1725.40]  It's ridiculous.
[1725.40 --> 1726.40]  People are awesome.
[1726.40 --> 1729.40]  I'm loving it.
[1729.40 --> 1732.40]  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba.
[1732.40 --> 1733.40]  I hated that campaign so much.
[1733.40 --> 1735.40]  Did Real Life Mario Kart just blow up recently?
[1735.40 --> 1736.40]  No, it's been doing well.
[1736.40 --> 1737.40]  Oh, okay.
[1737.40 --> 1738.40]  It's like consistent.
[1738.40 --> 1739.40]  I didn't notice how big that was.
[1739.40 --> 1740.40]  It's like 150 or something?
[1740.40 --> 1741.40]  Yeah.
[1741.40 --> 1742.40]  That one's been doing good.
[1742.40 --> 1745.40]  That's one interesting thing with Channel Super Fun is it's pretty spiky depending on
[1745.40 --> 1746.40]  what the content is.
[1746.40 --> 1748.40]  Yeah, it can be very spiky.
[1748.40 --> 1751.40]  I'm surprised more people didn't watch the wine rack one.
[1751.40 --> 1752.40]  I thought that one was hilarious.
[1752.40 --> 1753.40]  Yeah.
[1753.40 --> 1756.40]  It's a little weird.
[1756.40 --> 1757.40]  It is a little weird.
[1757.40 --> 1759.40]  And it might not be super shareable.
[1759.40 --> 1760.40]  Yeah.
[1760.40 --> 1762.40]  Like, it's, yeah.
[1762.40 --> 1763.40]  I guess that might be the issue.
[1763.40 --> 1766.40]  You're not going to be like, oh, check this out.
[1766.40 --> 1769.40]  This dude's wearing a bra which he's been squirted up on people with.
[1769.40 --> 1771.40]  Yeah, this dude's wearing a bra and squirting people.
[1771.40 --> 1773.40]  You guys make it sound so dirty.
[1773.40 --> 1774.40]  It was squirting.
[1774.40 --> 1775.40]  That's exactly what happened.
[1775.40 --> 1776.40]  It was squirting.
[1776.40 --> 1781.40]  You put on a bra, you squirting people with.
[1781.40 --> 1785.40]  Well, yeah.
[1785.40 --> 1787.40]  TechQuickie's crazy though.
[1787.40 --> 1793.40]  TechQuickie broke 100,000 views a day across the channel for the entire last month.
[1793.40 --> 1794.40]  That's insane.
[1794.40 --> 1795.40]  That's so nuts.
[1795.40 --> 1799.40]  And every new video we released does 100,000 views within like the first few days.
[1799.40 --> 1803.40]  And like, to some people that might not sound like that much based on what last TechQuick
[1803.40 --> 1806.40]  gets, but that's two releases a week compared to seven.
[1806.40 --> 1807.40]  And how young that channel is.
[1807.40 --> 1808.40]  Yeah.
[1808.40 --> 1809.40]  It's crazy.
[1809.40 --> 1810.40]  Yeah.
[1810.40 --> 1811.40]  We really started building this channel.
[1811.40 --> 1812.40]  In May.
[1812.40 --> 1813.40]  Beginning of this year.
[1813.40 --> 1816.40]  Was when we really hit it.
[1816.40 --> 1821.40]  Like, we were kind of at it at the beginning of the previous year and we kind of were supporting
[1821.40 --> 1826.40]  it for like a couple months and then it just sat there.
[1826.40 --> 1827.40]  Yeah.
[1827.40 --> 1831.40]  Well, we started with the two weeks scheduled content like in March or something.
[1831.40 --> 1833.40]  Is that when we started doing that?
[1833.40 --> 1838.40]  Well, we pull an Asus a little bit when it comes to our channels.
[1838.40 --> 1842.40]  We'll release a new channel and then we'll kind of like do some things.
[1842.40 --> 1843.40]  And then we'll just be like, okay now.
[1843.40 --> 1846.40]  And we'll be like, we figured out how we like doing this.
[1846.40 --> 1847.40]  Rawr!
[1847.40 --> 1848.40]  Well, a big part of it is resources.
[1848.40 --> 1856.40]  I mean, something most people don't understand is how time consuming it is to make the content
[1856.40 --> 1857.40]  that we do.
[1857.40 --> 1861.40]  I think a lot of people assume that like a new phone arrives, I open up the box, I kind
[1861.40 --> 1866.40]  of like look at it and then I just go stand in front of the camera and go bleh.
[1866.40 --> 1867.40]  Does someone have measuring tape?
[1867.40 --> 1868.40]  A measuring tape?
[1868.40 --> 1869.40]  Mm-hmm.
[1869.40 --> 1870.40]  I got one in my pants.
[1870.40 --> 1871.40]  Nine inches.
[1871.40 --> 1872.40]  Yeah.
[1872.40 --> 1873.40]  How about now?
[1873.40 --> 1875.40]  You can just hold it up against that, okay?
[1875.40 --> 1876.40]  How about now?
[1876.40 --> 1877.40]  Okay, come on over.
[1877.40 --> 1878.40]  Uh.
[1878.40 --> 1879.40]  Ha!
[1879.40 --> 1880.40]  No response.
[1880.40 --> 1883.40]  Don't you have one on your desk?
[1883.40 --> 1886.40]  I guess if I'm gonna tell, uh, oh, oh.
[1886.40 --> 1890.40]  Yeah, Taren, oh, uh, try the, try the Home Depot bin.
[1890.40 --> 1891.40]  Oh, yeah.
[1891.40 --> 1892.40]  Aha!
[1892.40 --> 1894.40]  I bet I put a, I bet I put a, I bet I put a...
[1894.40 --> 1897.40]  Although we don't even call it the hardware bin, it's just the Home Depot bin.
[1897.40 --> 1898.40]  Well, because that's what it is.
[1898.40 --> 1900.40]  It's not all, it's not all hardware.
[1900.40 --> 1903.40]  Anything you could buy at Home Depot goes in that bin.
[1903.40 --> 1905.40]  That's the way it works.
[1905.40 --> 1907.40]  I don't even like Home Depot though.
[1907.40 --> 1910.40]  I don't particularly like Home Depot either, but they're down the street.
[1910.40 --> 1912.40]  It's just the ones we buy stuff from.
[1912.40 --> 1913.40]  Oh.
[1913.40 --> 1914.40]  Just, most, everyone I've talked to you there.
[1914.40 --> 1918.40]  Every time I go in there, I was like, I wish there was a closer option than this.
[1918.40 --> 1922.40]  Everyone I've talked to there is just like so grossly unhelpful.
[1922.40 --> 1923.40]  I...
[1923.40 --> 1925.40]  Honestly, there's been people there that have been crazy helpful.
[1925.40 --> 1930.40]  I ran into like one crazy helpful lady there when I was buying light bulbs who actually
[1930.40 --> 1932.40]  approached me and asked if I needed help.
[1932.40 --> 1933.40]  Wow.
[1933.40 --> 1936.40]  See, that's weird because usually, not even that they won't approach you, there's just
[1936.40 --> 1937.40]  not nearly enough of them.
[1937.40 --> 1938.40]  Yeah.
[1938.40 --> 1939.40]  They need to like triple their staff.
[1939.40 --> 1944.40]  When I go in and I deal with like unhelpful people, it's when I'm going into like the
[1944.40 --> 1945.40]  siding section.
[1945.40 --> 1950.40]  So I think they hire people who are like meant to deal with contractors who don't want like
[1950.40 --> 1951.40]  BS.
[1951.40 --> 1952.40]  Right.
[1952.40 --> 1953.40]  So, yeah.
[1953.40 --> 1954.40]  But yeah.
[1954.40 --> 1955.40]  I'm sure there are very helpful.
[1955.40 --> 1959.40]  So there's like, there's a couple people that if I go in there, like I'll try to see if
[1959.40 --> 1962.40]  they're working specifically because they're super crazy helpful.
[1962.40 --> 1967.40]  There's this old dude that was like clearly a construction contractor earlier in his life
[1967.40 --> 1969.40]  and he probably just does this as like a hobby.
[1969.40 --> 1970.40]  Right.
[1970.40 --> 1972.40]  Because he doesn't seem to work full time at all.
[1972.40 --> 1973.40]  Yeah.
[1973.40 --> 1976.40]  But whenever I see him, I always try and grab him because he's crazy helpful.
[1976.40 --> 1977.40]  What's going on in there?
[1977.40 --> 1981.40]  And he always like has way too much knowledge on seemingly everything.
[1981.40 --> 1983.40]  He's, he did something previously.
[1983.40 --> 1984.40]  I'm sure.
[1984.40 --> 1988.40]  To be fair to those people, it could also be that I'm a complete idiot when it comes
[1988.40 --> 1989.40]  to like home stuff.
[1989.40 --> 1990.40]  Me too.
[1990.40 --> 1991.40]  But that's their job.
[1991.40 --> 1997.40]  That's like if, if people walked into Linus Tech Tips and were like, yeah, I need to understand
[1997.40 --> 1998.40]  motherboards.
[1998.40 --> 2002.40]  If I was like, oh, I guess so.
[2002.40 --> 2004.40]  I guess I could explain it fine.
[2004.40 --> 2006.40]  Like that's stupid.
[2006.40 --> 2007.40]  I find, okay.
[2007.40 --> 2008.40]  Equate it this way.
[2008.40 --> 2011.40]  The, the guys trying to help you with the computer at Best Buy versus the guys trying
[2011.40 --> 2013.40]  to help you with home improvement stuff at Home Depot.
[2013.40 --> 2019.40]  I feel like the average knowledge about the topic is better for home stuff at Home Depot
[2019.40 --> 2021.40]  than it is for computer stuff at Best Buy.
[2021.40 --> 2024.40]  To be fair to the Best Buy people though, that could also be that your knowledge is much
[2024.40 --> 2025.40]  greater in computers.
[2025.40 --> 2026.40]  Yeah.
[2026.40 --> 2030.40]  To just an average person, the Best Buy people might seem very informed.
[2030.40 --> 2031.40]  Whoa.
[2031.40 --> 2040.40]  I want you guys to vote on this because we're, I know we had promised Channel Super Fun would
[2040.40 --> 2045.40]  be kind of gaming and toys and there has been exactly zero gaming content on it so far.
[2045.40 --> 2052.40]  So one of the things we're considering adding would be a gaming podcast on Channel Super Fun.
[2052.40 --> 2055.40]  Um, so I just wanted to get your guys' thoughts.
[2055.40 --> 2059.40]  It's very unlikely, and you can go back and change your votes if you'd like, it's very unlikely
[2059.40 --> 2065.40]  that I will be co-hosting it because the cold hard truth is that I simply don't have the time
[2065.40 --> 2067.40]  to game as much these days as I'd like to.
[2067.40 --> 2074.40]  You know, what was reassuring to me today though was I was at NCIX filming something and Anthony
[2074.40 --> 2081.40]  over there set up a triple G-Sync monitor surround gaming setup and he had Borderlands the pre-sequel
[2081.40 --> 2082.40]  running on it.
[2082.40 --> 2087.40]  And so I was just like, I was waiting for them to fix something with the script or whatever
[2087.40 --> 2088.40]  it was they were doing.
[2088.40 --> 2092.40]  And so I was just kind of dicking around and I was like, hey, can I...
[2092.40 --> 2093.40]  People lost the link.
[2093.40 --> 2094.40]  Sorry.
[2094.40 --> 2095.40]  Sorry?
[2095.40 --> 2096.40]  People lost the link.
[2096.40 --> 2097.40]  Oh, I'll post it.
[2097.40 --> 2098.40]  Oh, never mind.
[2098.40 --> 2101.40]  The ghost's little bot, I forgot about the LLL thing.
[2101.40 --> 2107.40]  If people want Linus's last link or things that I post, it works for both, LLL in chat
[2107.40 --> 2111.40]  will have his bot respond with the last link that was posted by one of us.
[2111.40 --> 2115.40]  His bot's actually like way better than all the other ones.
[2115.40 --> 2116.40]  It's kind of cool.
[2116.40 --> 2121.40]  So I was, um, so I was just, I was like, where do I go to like fight some dudes?
[2121.40 --> 2126.40]  And he like leads me to like a very beginner area, even though he has a pretty leveled
[2126.40 --> 2129.40]  up character with like great guns and stuff.
[2129.40 --> 2130.40]  And I'm just like, this is easy.
[2130.40 --> 2131.40]  Where else can I go?
[2131.40 --> 2134.40]  He's like, okay, well here, you can go to this other place.
[2134.40 --> 2137.40]  And, uh, and so I'm like, I'm like sitting there playing.
[2137.40 --> 2139.40]  He's like, Linus, do you game?
[2139.40 --> 2144.40]  And I'm just like, well, not much these days, but yes, I have played video games in my life.
[2144.40 --> 2147.40]  He's like, you're really good at headshots.
[2147.40 --> 2150.40]  I'm just like, well, thank you.
[2150.40 --> 2155.40]  I'm, I'm pleased to know that I haven't completely lost it.
[2155.40 --> 2162.40]  Meanwhile, my video idea for the Makey Makey is to set up a fruit keyboard and mouse set up for me
[2162.40 --> 2164.40]  and then a normal set up for you.
[2164.40 --> 2165.40]  Really?
[2165.40 --> 2166.40]  See who wins.
[2166.40 --> 2170.40]  I want to set up like WSD, space bar, shift control and all that kind of stuff for fruit.
[2170.40 --> 2171.40]  I am totally down.
[2171.40 --> 2175.40]  And then I want to like strap bananas to the left and right click of a mouse so I can just touch those.
[2175.40 --> 2182.40]  But I think, I think that if we, um, so, so just for those of you who are curious,
[2182.40 --> 2186.40]  uh, ColdSC, Luke's brother who has co-hosted WAN Show in the past.
[2186.40 --> 2189.40]  It's been a while, which that might've helped this poll if it was more recent.
[2189.40 --> 2191.40]  Is definitely on the list.
[2191.40 --> 2195.40]  Um, we're, we're looking into making an offer for him to, to come in and co-host.
[2195.40 --> 2198.40]  So, um, so that, that there's potential for that to happen.
[2198.40 --> 2201.40]  He's definitely more, he plays a lot more games these days than I do.
[2201.40 --> 2204.40]  Um, anyway, so back to your, your challenge there.
[2204.40 --> 2206.40]  I just like, if I get rekt, it's funny.
[2206.40 --> 2207.40]  Okay.
[2207.40 --> 2208.40]  I'll tell you what.
[2208.40 --> 2209.40]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2209.40 --> 2211.40]  We gotta make this fair.
[2211.40 --> 2213.40]  So we can't just do one game.
[2213.40 --> 2214.40]  Okay.
[2214.40 --> 2219.40]  So, I pick a game, you pick a game, and then like an independent third party picks a game.
[2219.40 --> 2220.40]  So I'm picking Halo.
[2220.40 --> 2221.40]  Okay, okay.
[2221.40 --> 2223.40]  I thought you were gonna pick some like platformer.
[2223.40 --> 2224.40]  I was like this is gonna be so stupid.
[2224.40 --> 2225.40]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[2225.40 --> 2226.40]  FPS, FPS, FPS.
[2226.40 --> 2227.40]  Okay.
[2227.40 --> 2230.40]  FPS is the true measure of your skill with a keyboard and mouse.
[2230.40 --> 2231.40]  We all know this.
[2231.40 --> 2234.40]  Okay, you could argue RTS, I guess.
[2234.40 --> 2235.40]  MOBA.
[2235.40 --> 2236.40]  Most things.
[2236.40 --> 2237.40]  Okay, most things.
[2237.40 --> 2238.40]  Fine.
[2238.40 --> 2240.40]  Because it really depends what type of gamer you are, but I just thought...
[2240.40 --> 2242.40]  Anything but racing.
[2242.40 --> 2243.40]  Yeah.
[2243.40 --> 2249.40]  Um, I just thought FPS made sense because of like, I don't have to use a crazy amount of buttons.
[2249.40 --> 2250.40]  Right.
[2250.40 --> 2251.40]  Sure.
[2251.40 --> 2254.40]  Um, like I don't even know how much I can really do with the Makey Makey.
[2254.40 --> 2256.40]  So I'm going with Halo.
[2256.40 --> 2260.40]  You can pick something that you like, and then we'll have someone else pick something else.
[2260.40 --> 2261.40]  Just do Counter-Strike because it's easy.
[2261.40 --> 2263.40]  I don't have Counter-Strike.
[2263.40 --> 2265.40]  Or, oh, we could do like Source.
[2265.40 --> 2267.40]  Oh, wow.
[2267.40 --> 2269.40]  Just 1.6.
[2269.40 --> 2271.40]  I don't have CSGO.
[2271.40 --> 2272.40]  I know you don't.
[2272.40 --> 2274.40]  I don't even have Condition Zero.
[2274.40 --> 2275.40]  We...
[2275.40 --> 2277.40]  I don't think I do either, actually.
[2277.40 --> 2278.40]  I don't think anyone has.
[2278.40 --> 2282.40]  Um, we have enough accounts in the office that we could make it work.
[2282.40 --> 2283.40]  But I don't mind.
[2283.40 --> 2284.40]  We can play whatever.
[2284.40 --> 2287.40]  I just wanted Counter-Strike because it's a super well-known game.
[2287.40 --> 2288.40]  Because I suck at it?
[2288.40 --> 2289.40]  No.
[2289.40 --> 2290.40]  I am terrible at Counter-Strike.
[2290.40 --> 2292.40]  Okay, we can do Counter-Strike as long as we do like...
[2292.40 --> 2293.40]  We don't have to do Counter-Strike.
[2293.40 --> 2297.40]  As long as we do like old ass maps like Aztec or Dust or Dust2 or whatever.
[2297.40 --> 2298.40]  Yeah, no, it was going to be...
[2298.40 --> 2299.40]  Okay.
[2299.40 --> 2300.40]  Yeah.
[2300.40 --> 2301.40]  Screw train.
[2301.40 --> 2302.40]  I don't like train.
[2302.40 --> 2303.40]  I'm not playing train.
[2303.40 --> 2304.40]  I hate train.
[2304.40 --> 2305.40]  Yeah!
[2305.40 --> 2306.40]  So you made a new train.
[2306.40 --> 2307.40]  We could do nuke.
[2307.40 --> 2308.40]  I'm okay with nuke.
[2308.40 --> 2309.40]  I only really like the old stuff.
[2309.40 --> 2310.40]  Train is garbage.
[2310.40 --> 2311.40]  Go away.
[2311.40 --> 2315.40]  My main Counter-Strike playing was old, old, old stuff.
[2315.40 --> 2316.40]  So I only really like the old maps anyways.
[2316.40 --> 2317.40]  Okay.
[2317.40 --> 2320.40]  I'll probably want to wander around on the map a little bit just to reacquaint myself.
[2320.40 --> 2321.40]  That's fine.
[2321.40 --> 2322.40]  I don't really care.
[2322.40 --> 2323.40]  It's been a while.
[2323.40 --> 2324.40]  I didn't...
[2324.40 --> 2325.40]  Yeah.
[2325.40 --> 2326.40]  The more...
[2326.40 --> 2327.40]  The idea is to actually just mess around with the Makey Makey more than anything.
[2327.40 --> 2328.40]  Right.
[2328.40 --> 2330.40]  And like, I don't even remember how many inputs I can have, so I might have to use like half
[2330.40 --> 2333.40]  Makey Makey half keyboard, which is going to be ridiculous.
[2333.40 --> 2334.40]  It's going to be a nightmare.
[2334.40 --> 2339.40]  Because I think it's like arrow keys, space bar, and left and right click if I remember
[2339.40 --> 2340.40]  correctly.
[2340.40 --> 2341.40]  So like...
[2341.40 --> 2342.40]  I don't know.
[2342.40 --> 2343.40]  I don't know.
[2343.40 --> 2345.40]  It's going to be not great I think.
[2345.40 --> 2346.40]  Yeah.
[2346.40 --> 2350.40]  I wanted there to be some way that I didn't have to use an actual mouse, but...
[2350.40 --> 2351.40]  There's no motion in the drum.
[2351.40 --> 2352.40]  Because that doesn't make any sense.
[2352.40 --> 2353.40]  Yeah.
[2353.40 --> 2354.40]  Hmm.
[2354.40 --> 2355.40]  Unless you were like rolling a kiwi.
[2355.40 --> 2356.40]  But I don't think it can take that.
[2356.40 --> 2357.40]  No.
[2357.40 --> 2358.40]  Alright.
[2358.40 --> 2359.40]  Well, thank you guys.
[2359.40 --> 2361.40]  We had more viewers on After Party than we've ever had on WAN Show.
[2361.40 --> 2362.40]  Wow.
[2362.40 --> 2363.40]  Yeah.
[2363.40 --> 2364.40]  7,000?
[2364.40 --> 2365.40]  7,000?
[2365.40 --> 2366.40]  6,800.
[2366.40 --> 2367.40]  Oh, wow.
[2367.40 --> 2368.40]  Maybe not quite...
[2368.40 --> 2369.40]  We've had more than that.
[2369.40 --> 2370.40]  Okay, maybe not quite more than ever, but...
[2370.40 --> 2371.40]  Like average.
[2371.40 --> 2372.40]  Someone said in chat you guys said 8,300 when you had Total Biscuit on and that was the
[2372.40 --> 2373.40]  previous high.
[2373.40 --> 2374.40]  Was it 8,300?
[2374.40 --> 2375.40]  Apparently.
[2375.40 --> 2376.40]  I didn't think we went...
[2376.40 --> 2377.40]  Okay, well we beat that today for sure.
[2377.40 --> 2378.40]  Yeah.
[2378.40 --> 2379.40]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2379.40 --> 2380.40]  We beat that today for sure.
[2380.40 --> 2381.40]  It's been a long time.
[2381.40 --> 2382.40]  I probably just remember that.
[2382.40 --> 2383.40]  I don't know.
[2383.40 --> 2384.40]  Like, what happened?
[2384.40 --> 2385.40]  Someone in chat was saying January's huge for streaming.
[2385.40 --> 2388.40]  Apparently he broke a whole bunch of records for his Minecraft stream.
[2388.40 --> 2389.40]  Why?
[2389.40 --> 2390.40]  That's a lot of people.
[2390.40 --> 2391.40]  I don't know.
[2391.40 --> 2392.40]  I don't know.
[2392.40 --> 2393.40]  Like, what happened?
[2393.40 --> 2394.40]  Just...
[2394.40 --> 2396.40]  Someone in chat was saying January's huge for streaming.
[2396.40 --> 2399.40]  Apparently he broke a whole bunch of records for his Minecraft stream.
[2399.40 --> 2400.40]  Why?
[2400.40 --> 2401.40]  Back in...
[2401.40 --> 2402.40]  I don't know.
[2402.40 --> 2404.40]  I guess it's cold?
[2404.40 --> 2405.40]  I think...
[2405.40 --> 2406.40]  Well, it's probably cold.
[2406.40 --> 2408.40]  People are winding down from Christmas.
[2408.40 --> 2409.40]  Right.
[2409.40 --> 2411.40]  I don't think high school's probably back in session yet.
[2411.40 --> 2412.40]  Probably not.
[2412.40 --> 2413.40]  Okay.
[2413.40 --> 2415.40]  So people are returning home.
[2415.40 --> 2417.40]  Kind of vegetating a little bit.
[2417.40 --> 2420.40]  And a lot of people aren't back to school yet.
[2420.40 --> 2422.40]  Because I don't think high school or university would have started yet.
[2422.40 --> 2423.40]  No.
[2423.40 --> 2424.40]  University definitely hasn't.
[2424.40 --> 2425.40]  Yeah.
[2425.40 --> 2426.40]  So...
[2426.40 --> 2428.40]  Yeah, everybody's not in school yet.
[2428.40 --> 2431.40]  Are you doing an after party yourself at all today?
[2431.40 --> 2432.40]  No.
[2432.40 --> 2433.40]  I will be doing one tomorrow.
[2433.40 --> 2434.40]  Okay, cool.
[2434.40 --> 2435.40]  Tomorrow afternoon.
[2435.40 --> 2437.40]  I will not be doing one tonight.
[2437.40 --> 2438.40]  Okay.
[2438.40 --> 2439.40]  Well, good night everyone.
[2439.40 --> 2440.40]  Thank you very much for tuning in.
[2440.40 --> 2441.40]  You guys are awesome.
[2441.40 --> 2442.40]  We'll see you again.
