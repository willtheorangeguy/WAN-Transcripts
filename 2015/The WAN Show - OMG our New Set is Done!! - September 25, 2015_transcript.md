[0.00 --> 6.28]  uh technical difficulties over the last few weeks um as you guys have probably noticed from week to
[6.28 --> 12.50]  week over the last well probably six to eight weeks we've been very yeah we've been very much
[12.50 --> 19.54]  closer to three actually but that's fair you know we've been very much under construction for the
[19.54 --> 26.22]  last little while the WAN show has actually been physically moving around from week to week quite
[26.22 --> 34.46]  frequently this is incredible twitch has now implemented a feature where the ad that plays
[34.46 --> 42.78]  before the stream cannot be paused or muted that is fantastic thank you twitch for that
[42.78 --> 48.04]  wow anyway thanks for like basically making everyone install adbock
[48.04 --> 57.20]  yeah anyway moving on so we've been very much under construction and you'll probably notice a
[57.20 --> 62.54]  huge difference between the way we have it set up this week and the way we had it set up last week
[62.54 --> 67.76]  hopefully you guys like it and if you don't the people in the pre-show know what I think of that
[67.76 --> 72.46]  because I personally think it looks great uh there's still a few things that we're going to tweak like
[72.46 --> 77.80]  the positions of things on the shelves and like I want to get an actual shock mount for this microphone
[77.80 --> 82.86]  instead of just having it sitting on a folded up shirt can it just be like a little coil that
[82.86 --> 87.40]  shocks people whenever they try to move it no no because if we're going to take it really literally
[87.40 --> 94.18]  shock mount could have some pretty scary sorts of meanings there uh anyway we've got a great show
[94.18 --> 99.76]  for you guys today uh pebble yeah oh there's two different definitions of shock that are both that
[99.76 --> 106.32]  both work well that was a multi multi-level dirty sort of toilet humor joke I think I actually
[106.32 --> 111.36]  thought of the second one I mean are sex jokes really toilet humor unless you have sex on a
[111.36 --> 117.84]  toilet then which is not recommended but possible but possible it's like no really I got pregnant from
[117.84 --> 126.00]  the toilet seat also there was like another person there so what is this show about pebble toilet seat
[126.00 --> 131.86]  has introduced their first round smart watch what an innovation we should just actually host a
[131.86 --> 137.58]  lan show only about toilet seats no we shouldn't pat volkswagen oh speaking of things that are in the
[137.58 --> 144.92]  toilet volkswagen stock uh they've been ordered to recall 500 000 cars that's the initial news that
[144.92 --> 149.84]  broke uh but it's going deeper than that so we're going to be discussing that on the show today
[149.84 --> 160.02]  apple to release the d jack um which i think i have that patented is almost as almost as
[160.02 --> 170.90]  almost as dirty as it sounds and north america is straight up out of ipv4 addresses for real this
[170.90 --> 173.70]  time so uh stay tuned guys it's going to be a great show
[190.02 --> 209.94]  you guys see how smooth that was it worked that's what happens when i actually set aside like an hour
[209.94 --> 215.12]  before the show to set up and then we start still we start like 40 minutes late
[215.12 --> 221.76]  no we still need to format the system but everything else about it is set up this system
[221.76 --> 228.56]  is so freaking bored click oh here you know what no no no no i'm gonna show them the thing yeah yeah
[228.56 --> 233.52]  no no okay okay okay so guys guys this this is gonna be good hold on let me just make sure there's
[233.52 --> 239.12]  no like you know nothing that i can be sued for on screen here you guys are gonna love this though okay
[239.12 --> 244.80]  so add uh screen capture let's do the whole screen here all right here we go here we go buddies
[245.92 --> 253.52]  this is some good stuff right here so so check check this out just awesome what is what is that
[255.52 --> 259.68]  what even is that and where'd they go where are they and then they're gonna come back at some point
[259.68 --> 265.92]  yeah and there's like this one missing yeah and like what is this this is nothing it's nothing it's
[265.92 --> 273.92]  just it's just nothing and uh that's just that's just one of the many completely broke dick things
[273.92 --> 279.84]  oh yeah about this windows install that's just like weird there's ones that are really bad well the
[279.84 --> 285.60]  thing is is i think when you get enough blue screens on a system something just starts to have bit rot
[285.60 --> 293.52]  whatever yeah things things things things just decay and this is one decades it's not bit rot
[293.52 --> 301.92]  well decay okay well okay whatever this is a broken windows install it takes forever to boot up on an ssd
[302.48 --> 309.68]  and it actually has like nothing installed on it like webcam drivers uh video chat when you blue screen
[309.68 --> 315.20]  like two times every single time you run the computer yeah then you're basically asking asking for
[315.20 --> 320.80]  trouble but but no no the stream's not gonna blue screen because uh we are running off you stuttered on
[321.36 --> 326.72]  the blue screen i know i wasn't sure i wasn't sure if i should say it or not do we have wood is this
[326.72 --> 334.96]  even real wood i don't know it's mdf it's worth it knock on mdf um so because the black magic cards that
[334.96 --> 341.52]  caused the stream to blue screen are both working now i did luke's bringing his wood over
[341.52 --> 352.08]  his massive wood all right so we're good we're good um people are like bet the ram is bad no it has
[352.08 --> 358.64]  nothing to do with bad ram it has to do with the drivers for our black magic capture cards not liking
[358.64 --> 366.96]  anything uh well no more specifically not liking themselves and their life um so should we should we
[366.96 --> 373.84]  like do a show i guess i guess i guess we should do a show all right so our first topic is uh oh this
[373.84 --> 382.00]  is interesting hold on wait yes i need the other mouse though i got this minus screen boom yay things
[382.00 --> 389.60]  are working today it's not going to be that day uh so a new face for pebble it started with a text
[389.60 --> 395.36]  seven years ago something something etc etc all right let's just uh let's just pop this baby up okay
[395.36 --> 400.80]  whatever show us the watch man okay so we had square watches before look at that it's amazing
[400.80 --> 405.28]  it's actually kind of rounded so i don't know how i don't know if it's really strictly speaking square
[405.28 --> 411.60]  but this is it the pebble time round oh it keeps going back to he looks like me but with fuzzy hair
[413.20 --> 417.92]  you know you actually have like okay i don't want you to take this the wrong way you're gonna say a
[417.92 --> 424.16]  really generic face because everyone sends me twitter things you look like this dude and i'm like
[425.68 --> 432.40]  a lot of the time i can i can kind of see it i know you have like kind of that i never thought that
[432.40 --> 438.00]  until i got this job and then everyone just tells me that i look like everyone yeah yeah like i can kind
[438.00 --> 442.72]  of see it you're like well you're kind of the blue-eyed blonde-haired like guy with kind of the rugged
[443.44 --> 448.88]  sort of face i don't want to say okay well no i'll say ruggedly handsome face okay okay with the
[448.88 --> 455.44]  rugged face usually looks like someone just drove a truck over your face yeah it's like you know man
[456.08 --> 461.36]  it's rugged your face looks like it could go through a war yeah your face looks like it could be
[462.08 --> 470.48]  a tire probably like ip67 so there we go this is the pebble time round basically it's got the same
[470.48 --> 479.04]  processing on board as the steel it is hyper hyper thin it is round and they have an sdk out for app
[479.04 --> 485.52]  developers to allow them to convert their applications to the round face which is which is the only real
[485.52 --> 490.16]  difference because they haven't changed a bunch of the other hardware what they did do is they nerfed
[490.16 --> 498.40]  the battery life pretty hardcore what's up why what do you mean why i didn't know that that sucks
[498.40 --> 504.72]  because it's thin now i don't care i was talking to someone the other day this is probably a bad idea
[504.72 --> 509.20]  because i'm talking to people i'm gonna well yes but i'm gonna say an idea that i want to have for a
[509.20 --> 515.20]  video oh okay but i don't know if you'd let me do it anyways but i want to do um a review of modern
[515.20 --> 521.36]  phones and during the review i want the phone that's in my hand to constantly change the whole
[521.36 --> 526.96]  time and i want it to be like it has a great screen it'll run all the apps you want just fine
[526.96 --> 532.96]  the generic games just fine uh it's nice and thin the buttons are really good the headphone jack works
[532.96 --> 536.72]  really well the speakers are kind of meh and it's gonna be way too easy to block them and they're not
[536.72 --> 543.04]  in the right spot transfer speeds at usb2 over a wire yeah okay um like all this kind of stuff and then
[543.04 --> 550.48]  but the battery's shit thanks for watching have a good time i want to do that video so bad because
[550.48 --> 555.12]  honestly it's pretty accurate for like everything i think we could do that but you know what the thing
[555.12 --> 560.80]  about the round is that you can get another day of battery life oh yeah oh yeah it's so thin that i
[560.80 --> 565.84]  don't care anymore right that happened a long time ago and it could be thicker but it kind of did yeah
[565.84 --> 571.52]  it kind of did um there's some good news though you can get a day's worth of battery in 15 minutes
[571.52 --> 579.76]  minutes however my issue with pebble continues to be that they use a proprietary charger so the the
[579.76 --> 585.84]  problem is not how long it takes to charge the problem is that i have to actually be where my
[585.84 --> 591.44]  charging cable is which for me is on my nightstand so if i'm traveling or whatever the fact that i can
[591.44 --> 597.12]  charge it up for a day worth of battery in 15 minutes uh except that i don't have my cable is actually
[597.12 --> 602.16]  not that not that helpful and the fact that they keep changing the cable all the time um
[603.52 --> 609.12]  like every generation they just change the cable need to learn from uh who is it who doesn't really
[609.12 --> 614.48]  what playstation i think it's playstation's cable has like never changed yeah but the compatibility is
[614.48 --> 620.80]  broken oh yeah that's worse i actually didn't know that yeah so when it comes to like seven deadly
[620.80 --> 624.96]  sins okay when we talk when we talk about when we talk about cables because this is something people
[624.96 --> 634.00]  talked about a lot with intel lga 775 so this was a time when amd was changing their cpu socket it seemed
[634.00 --> 643.36]  like every year okay so we had socket a okay 462 then we got socket 940 on the enthusiast platform for fx
[643.36 --> 649.68]  which was essentially the server socket but like there was like two cpus and you're someone's gonna correct
[649.68 --> 656.48]  me i don't care uh the point i think we got the fx 51 and 53 and maybe 55 for that socket but it's it's
[656.48 --> 663.76]  it's not the point so then we got socket 754 at the same time that was like single channel memory and the
[663.76 --> 668.96]  consumer version and then both of those went away on the consumer except 940 was still there on the
[668.96 --> 676.64]  server and then we got 939 on the desktop and then we went from 939 to i want to say am2 and then we got
[676.64 --> 683.68]  am2 plus and am3 so amd has done this weird like like anyway this was back in the in the 939 to am2
[683.68 --> 690.08]  days and everyone was criticizing amd going they keep changing their cpu socket i have no upgrade path
[690.08 --> 698.64]  intel's had lga 775 for like five years or however long they had it the problem is that the intercompatibility
[698.64 --> 706.88]  from one 775 board to another 775 chip across generations was terrible like it was awful it
[706.88 --> 713.76]  changed as often or more as amd's socket did at least with amd it was clear you buy a 939 chip you
[713.76 --> 719.52]  put in a 939 socket it works with intel you buy a 775 chip you plug it in and you cross your fingers
[719.52 --> 723.68]  and your toes and you pray to whatever deity it is you believe in and maybe it'll turn on and a lot
[723.68 --> 727.60]  of the time the compatibility is more complicated than that because maybe even if it doesn't turn
[727.60 --> 732.88]  on you can like i don't know find a buddy who has a last gen chip and put that in and flash the bios
[732.88 --> 738.48]  and maybe the new chip will work but maybe like not quite as optimally come on so that was my favorite
[738.48 --> 742.80]  part was hunting for someone who had the right chip so you could do a bios update
[742.80 --> 755.04]  so anyway that's still a complaint however one thing i will say about this super slim design that
[755.04 --> 762.24]  that i do think has a value is my wife looked at it immediately said oh that's way better
[763.60 --> 770.72]  so i have been critical how long does it they hit a very good thinness with that i will agree but how
[770.72 --> 774.08]  long does it last i think it's like two to three days or something like that okay so that's not
[774.08 --> 780.96]  too bad yeah so it's still not a one day battery uh give me just like i i am i am forgetting how
[780.96 --> 785.52]  long it's yeah there you go to about two day battery life so it's still better than what you're going to
[785.52 --> 790.08]  get out of an apple watch and i've been really critical of other smart watch makers pretty much
[790.08 --> 796.32]  everyone but apple for not making like a properly functional smart watch because there have been
[796.32 --> 801.20]  devices you say everyone but apple yeah i think the apple watch looks great on a on a lady's wrist
[801.20 --> 807.60]  oh i heard something else yeah you're good yeah um where was i going with this right so i've been
[807.60 --> 813.20]  really critical of everyone but apple for not making a properly functional smart watch that's actually
[813.20 --> 820.32]  not going to look weird on my wife um so now that pebble's doing it i can't rip into them for reducing
[820.32 --> 826.16]  the battery capacity because you have to make trade-offs and i know there have existed smart
[826.16 --> 833.76]  watches and wearable devices that are like fashion accessories but the functionality on them is so bad
[833.76 --> 841.44]  it's like it's like you know there's it all comes down to what sort of margin a company is used to making
[841.44 --> 849.92]  okay so when uh you know when a computer company comes out with a new like a new uh you know smart
[849.92 --> 857.44]  accessory and it's priced at x you're gonna have like you know let's say y amount of functionality
[857.44 --> 863.12]  built into it because they're reserving this much for them to just make money yeah and you need to pay
[863.12 --> 869.52]  other people like distributors and yes the guy that actually sells it to you when a shoe company comes in
[869.52 --> 877.68]  and makes a smart accessory their expectation for how much is left over at the end is much higher so
[877.68 --> 885.20]  you get like this crummy functionality with a rubbish screen sorry oh where'd the overlay go that's weird
[887.92 --> 897.44]  the watermark.png has disappeared that's fine i can i can live i can i can work with that um so
[897.44 --> 904.00]  they're gonna have a certain expectation for how much margin that they're making and that is exactly
[904.00 --> 910.00]  the problem is that these companies are gonna think that they should be making you know 200 percent
[910.64 --> 919.28]  on a watch yeah clothing clothing jewelry fashion brands um are pretty much up their own butts in terms
[919.28 --> 925.68]  of what they think that their vision is worth um and they and they tend to kind of ignore the the practical
[925.68 --> 931.36]  stuff yeah so cool like perfume and cologne and all that kind of like a lot of things in those
[931.36 --> 936.64]  categories are like that i think he just said uh clothing fashion and jewelry because those are the
[936.64 --> 942.32]  companies that are kind of getting into smart watches now yes exactly uh so i don't know where our
[942.32 --> 950.64]  normal lower third is we haven't changed it in forever i cannot find it why is my life sad
[950.64 --> 959.12]  thanks i really need to reformat this computer don't let me run the show next week until this
[959.12 --> 967.20]  computer is formatted because we're gonna run the show then hey that's not a nice thing to say all
[967.20 --> 973.76]  right face fade away there we go and then i think there's like i don't even know where the upper right
[973.76 --> 980.08]  corner thing is like what what where is that does anyone does anyone know i don't think anyone knows
[980.08 --> 984.72]  maybe it's called watermark why don't you just use the search was it in watermark i don't know
[984.72 --> 994.72]  is there one called watermark oh general assets when watermark topleft.png yay hey look at that
[994.72 --> 999.20]  that's not a technical difficulty is it is that a strike i think so do we have a three strikes rule
[999.20 --> 1007.12]  no can we have a six strikes rule 15 we need a lot of strikes here yeah all right three's not
[1007.12 --> 1012.96]  going to cut it um six six may be okay six sounds about good all right so uh anyway that uh that watch
[1012.96 --> 1017.68]  is aiming to ship somewhere in the time frame of november 10th and honestly i'm considering buying
[1017.68 --> 1023.52]  one i'll pick one up for the wifey because she works in a pharmacy and in the pharmacy they have like
[1023.52 --> 1033.76]  a no phones rule but it would certainly be nice to to be you're just circumventing outdated policies
[1033.76 --> 1040.64]  yes so it would be nice to and it like it's funny because like uh around here we're a very tech savvy
[1040.64 --> 1045.92]  employer at linus media group like if people are on their phones at work i'm not giving them a hard
[1045.92 --> 1052.00]  time about it because i understand that your phone is like pretty much your life unless their job function
[1052.00 --> 1057.28]  really has nothing to do with their phone and they're on it a lot because i consider things
[1057.28 --> 1062.08]  like tweeting while you're at the office about the things that we're doing i consider that
[1062.08 --> 1067.60]  sort of work so but but in a pharmacy i also understand this you can't really call it an
[1067.60 --> 1073.76]  outdated policy i can't think of any reason why a technician who's counting pills because it didn't
[1073.76 --> 1080.56]  include smart watches oh i see what you mean ah other form of right so so anyway the point is
[1080.56 --> 1085.52]  if there's an emergency with the kids or whatever it's nice to be able to get through to her even if
[1085.52 --> 1090.80]  she can't message me back i don't expect her to use things like you know voice response functionality
[1090.80 --> 1096.72]  because she's also the manager so the the harder she tries to circumvent the rules the more terrible
[1096.72 --> 1102.88]  that looks but it's nice to be able to you know just be like hey this or whatever hey can you pick
[1102.88 --> 1109.84]  up something she works at costco so like there's usually something i want her to buy i just ate two bags of
[1109.84 --> 1116.08]  those awesome dried mangoes please get me two more bags actually make it three it's a friday
[1119.52 --> 1126.08]  it's this friday make it five yeah yeah oh it's been a rough day do you want to just do that nope
[1126.08 --> 1133.92]  okay apparently not you're putting it off apparently for now because something's not working great so
[1133.92 --> 1139.44]  yeah it's like the the most minor of all the things and it's the one that's not working but
[1139.44 --> 1143.76]  it kind of needs to be set up for everything to go smoothly all right everything will go without it
[1143.76 --> 1152.64]  but not smoothly so this has been huge news over the last week uh vw was basically found to be cheating
[1153.20 --> 1160.00]  on their u.s emission standards tests the cars were detecting if they were being tested and they were
[1160.00 --> 1168.72]  reducing their output by as much as 40 times or they were outputting 140th uh during testing and then
[1168.72 --> 1174.72]  they were ramping it up 40 times on the road this is on their diesel cars and not all of them but it
[1174.72 --> 1181.68]  was ones with their four cylinder diesel engine and so basically what this means is the car performed better
[1181.68 --> 1190.56]  for owners yeah which it depends how you define performed better right it felt peppier when you
[1190.56 --> 1197.76]  press the gas pedal yes yeah um but but they were turning off their emissions control systems in order
[1197.76 --> 1205.60]  to achieve this so uh their shares have dropped oh this is this is like being updated in like real time
[1205.60 --> 1211.36]  their shares have dropped approximately 35 percent so if you believe that volkswagen is going to pull out of
[1211.36 --> 1218.88]  this um okay with all the usual disclaimers i don't know anyone who works at volkswagen linus media group
[1218.88 --> 1225.20]  has never collaborated with volkswagen um i do not own any shares in volkswagen i don't own any shares in
[1225.20 --> 1232.64]  anything so take this as this in what oh well in this company no no like publicly traded publicly traded
[1232.64 --> 1239.92]  shares like on a stock market i don't own any shares of any publicly traded companies okay so take this for
[1239.92 --> 1246.48]  the ignorance that it is if you believe that volkswagen will recover now might be a nice time to buy
[1246.48 --> 1254.88]  because that strategy has worked for many people in the past however the difference between bad news
[1254.88 --> 1262.96]  about a product and bad news about the potential 18 billion dollar fine that volkswagen could be paying
[1262.96 --> 1273.36]  in the us alone so we're talking 37 500 per affected vehicle of which there are 500 000 which is higher
[1273.36 --> 1281.36]  than the value than a whole bunch of those that were recalled um so so so so factor that in now
[1282.24 --> 1290.00]  the the bad news gets worse uh volkswagen is being investigated in other territories as well
[1290.00 --> 1294.64]  and canada being canada will probably just do the exact same thing that the states did
[1295.44 --> 1305.84]  and it's not just volkswagen either so this is great uh the bmw x3 x drive 20d exceeds european
[1305.84 --> 1313.44]  standards by a shocking 11 times the only reason that 11 times doesn't sound that bad in this context
[1313.44 --> 1322.08]  is that volkswagen was exceeding the u.s standards by 40 times so yeah bmw has issued a denial of any
[1322.08 --> 1326.96]  manipulation saying there's no difference in the treatment of exhaust emissions whether they are on
[1326.96 --> 1336.16]  test rollers or on the road although vw has admitted it their ceo has stepped down and uh they are in for
[1336.16 --> 1344.32]  some serious hot water apparently there's two water marks now uh oh oh oh that's kind of interesting
[1345.28 --> 1351.04]  uh i don't know which is which oh wow there's two lower thirds what is happening
[1353.76 --> 1361.76]  i don't know i hate this take the prettier one okay i this is not a second strike this is the same issue
[1361.76 --> 1368.72]  they just like disappeared for a little while i don't know what's happening but it's fine now
[1369.52 --> 1372.24]  shut up all of you what especially you
[1375.36 --> 1382.80]  anyway bmw's x5 uh was looked at by the west virginia university and epa as part of investigations
[1382.80 --> 1390.00]  into the issue it passed it's important to note that almost every car has higher real world emissions
[1390.00 --> 1395.68]  than their laboratory results that's i mean there are so many things that are like that let's talk
[1395.68 --> 1403.60]  about you know wi-fi speeds hey no real world nothing to do with lab results do they advertise the
[1404.16 --> 1411.20]  you know perfect world no overhead test results yes should they be allowed to probably not but is that
[1411.20 --> 1417.44]  the world we live in yes yeah um that happens for tons of stuff so the uk government has stated that
[1417.44 --> 1422.08]  today they will be launching their own vehicle emissions testing following the us's findings
[1423.12 --> 1428.88]  oh so this is very much an emerging story we might even be talking about this again next week but i think
[1428.88 --> 1435.92]  what's safe to say at this point in time is that there is one vehicle maker who has nothing to worry about
[1438.32 --> 1445.36]  the safest way to not exceed your rated emissions is to have no emissions whatsoever didn't they release an
[1445.36 --> 1450.88]  ad like trolling them or something oh probably i think they did i don't know if this is actually
[1450.88 --> 1456.08]  about that um but yeah there's a tesla no emissions ad that it's like the best way to pass an emissions
[1456.08 --> 1461.36]  test is to or this whole this whole car is an emissions test destroying machine or something i don't
[1461.36 --> 1467.04]  remember exactly what it is yeah i don't know if this is actually from tesla or anything this just looks
[1467.04 --> 1473.60]  like that's yeah no that's yeah so there you go so zero emissions uh means they could not possibly
[1473.60 --> 1480.08]  get into any kind of hot water here so there you go guys um if you have an affected car there's a
[1480.08 --> 1486.40]  forced recall in the us but stay tuned because things are going to get really interesting worldwide
[1486.40 --> 1492.64]  over the next i mean this could take months this this could take easily months potentially years
[1492.64 --> 1499.28]  to finally be resolved so if we're going to weigh in on stock things my opinion might be to not
[1499.28 --> 1505.36]  necessarily do it now wait till they get hit by a few more countries but then yeah but then people
[1505.36 --> 1509.44]  might go like oh i should buy now because it's really low and then it's going to go up and then
[1509.44 --> 1514.00]  it might not fall as far as it went up yeah people might be might be trying to hold for the long term like
[1514.96 --> 1518.24]  we don't know we don't play stocks so literally not at all yeah
[1518.24 --> 1524.96]  and i will say that i straight up don't do it because i don't know what i'm doing yep me too
[1526.16 --> 1532.88]  all right apple to release the d uh the original article here is from apple insider
[1533.84 --> 1542.88]  salty and creamy at the same time what the hell that leaves nothing to the imagination uh yeah it does
[1542.88 --> 1547.84]  marmite was salty and creamy that's true that was awful that was really marmite is terrible
[1547.84 --> 1551.68]  it's really gross to all of our australian viewers what you're supposed to do is spread it
[1552.88 --> 1558.96]  very thinly over toast what is the point and we like lathered it well it's kind of like if you took
[1559.92 --> 1563.76]  by the way people have been complaining about this you sit back like this when you're going to talk
[1563.76 --> 1569.60]  for a while and then i can't hear it okay my bad when if you took like a massive amount of
[1570.64 --> 1575.44]  wow yeah nothing's really that bad uh butter if you took so much butter that it was that thick
[1575.44 --> 1579.60]  and put it on top of a pizza it's like putting it's like well yeah but no one would ever put
[1579.60 --> 1584.72]  butter on pizza but no one would ever put marmite on pizza but some people claim that they would
[1585.36 --> 1590.56]  who dennis was saying he thinks it would be good with but dennis is so weird i know i don't think
[1590.56 --> 1596.08]  dennis is fair in this conversation this is the guy that literally like spits out a banana yeah when
[1596.08 --> 1601.36]  he tries to take a bite of a chocolate covered insect that really is not that bad wasn't that bad did
[1601.36 --> 1606.16]  you eat one no i have way in the past oh okay yeah like it wasn't a little kid party when i was a
[1606.16 --> 1610.96]  little kid like it grossed me out because i kind of have a bug phobia so when i crunched into it it
[1610.96 --> 1616.72]  was like like it made my whole body go ah like no i can't do this yeah but but like the taste
[1617.52 --> 1622.72]  wasn't that bad no and then marmite i'm sitting here like i folded up my pizza because i was trying
[1622.72 --> 1626.40]  to get over as fast as possible and then when i bit into it it all squished out onto my tongue at
[1626.40 --> 1632.80]  the same time so that was the wrong idea i screwed up um and i'm like basically hurling in the corner
[1632.80 --> 1639.84]  meanwhile dennis is like this is great i even had to ask him i was like would you put marmite on it
[1639.84 --> 1647.44]  just normally and just eat it and he's like no maybe less yeah less yeah he was like oh well not this
[1647.44 --> 1656.16]  much you're killing me here man uh marmite yay or nay where were we going with this i don't know we were
[1656.16 --> 1661.36]  talking oh we were talking about uh creamy salty things creamy salty things right okay so i wanna
[1661.36 --> 1665.84]  no i wanna i wanna i wanna throw this to you guys first so we got a straw poll we got a straw poll
[1665.84 --> 1670.64]  going here marmite yay or nay and we should give some context for that we had to have pizza with
[1670.64 --> 1676.96]  marmite for an upcoming channel super fun and and dragon's fury hot sauce yeah that was interesting too
[1676.96 --> 1683.04]  i what i'll say about this upcoming channel super fun is that i literally had to lie down for 10 minutes
[1683.04 --> 1689.04]  about an hour after we filmed it to just let my stomach get its crap together so to speak i felt
[1689.04 --> 1690.72]  really gross i honestly oh wow
[1693.28 --> 1697.36]  oh no i felt really gross and honestly i think it was more because of the marmite
[1698.40 --> 1704.64]  yeah it was it was it was a terrible experience so let's talk about apple's new connector now
[1704.64 --> 1710.72]  this is funny because i am pretty sure that we have straight up talked about this on the show before
[1710.72 --> 1716.96]  how like there's going to be a limit to how thin apple can go because you still need a headphone jack
[1717.92 --> 1727.92]  no no this is their new patented plug design uh that uh that that has a d-like profile so basically
[1727.92 --> 1735.12]  you're going to take your d jack you're going to plug it into your phone receptacle and uh in in theory
[1735.12 --> 1745.44]  there should be no issues with adapting the the d-shaped cavity jack to a regular round pair of
[1745.44 --> 1753.20]  headphones or adapting your round pair of headphones to a d-shaped jack but i really have to kind of like
[1753.20 --> 1758.48]  remember that rumor that apple was going to convert their phones to use the lightning connector for
[1758.48 --> 1767.52]  audio um that hasn't happened but this almost feels even stupider because you're basically just
[1767.52 --> 1775.68]  forcing people to throw a for the sake of elegance you're forcing a lot of people to use adapters and
[1775.68 --> 1782.08]  i know there's going to be the millions of people out there buying beats and plugging their beats into
[1782.08 --> 1791.36]  this with their stupid proprietary closed ecosystem ridiculous thing but um at the same time it really
[1791.36 --> 1796.16]  is pretty annoying would you prefer have the lightning connector be taken over anytime you wanted to use
[1796.16 --> 1802.16]  headphones or would you prefer being able to plug two things in and have one of them be a weird
[1802.16 --> 1808.80]  project you know what nothing use a three and a half millimeter jack make your phone thinner yes yeah
[1808.80 --> 1815.52]  your phone is make your phone thicker enough put more battery please i mean it's one of those things
[1815.52 --> 1820.96]  this is this is what drives me crazy the camera bumps just gonna be bigger yeah yeah the thinner you go
[1820.96 --> 1829.92]  the bigger your camera bump so this is what drives me crazy this is what it takes okay for an android phone
[1829.92 --> 1837.76]  to deliver the experience that i want which is me using it pretty much as much as i want for an entire day
[1837.76 --> 1845.92]  and the problem with android is that its idle power uh management is really bad so poor you take an
[1845.92 --> 1851.68]  android phone with an app loadout okay it doesn't count to just take it out of the box and put it down
[1851.68 --> 1857.60]  and go haha see it only lost seven percent battery today not good enough take an android phone that
[1857.60 --> 1864.24]  actually has apps on it one that you actually use yeah put it aside for like a day and it'll have lost 20 to
[1864.24 --> 1872.08]  30 percent battery which is terrible my ipad or my iphone loses like two percent per day i can sit my
[1872.08 --> 1877.52]  ipad can sit for two weeks without me touching it and still have like 40 on the batteries it's actually
[1877.52 --> 1887.20]  usable by the time i get back to it so i want apple's battery life management but i also want a legitimately
[1887.20 --> 1894.96]  high capacity battery because that's the problem with the iphone if you know heaven forbid you dare
[1894.96 --> 1903.76]  to use it to navigate somewhere it's just instantly dead like i can drain an iphone in like you know
[1903.76 --> 1909.68]  five hours six hours if i'm using it really heavily like if i'm navigating somewhere and i'm talking to
[1909.68 --> 1916.08]  somebody on speaker and like like you can hit it pretty hard you can drain it pretty fast whereas the
[1916.08 --> 1922.24]  droid turbo because it actually has a massive battery it's not just you know power saving tricks and
[1922.64 --> 1929.68]  and and and little like voodoo magic that's going on it actually can be used for a significant portion
[1929.68 --> 1937.68]  of the day so i would love for apple to do like an iphone 6 endurance or 7 endurance or or whatever it
[1937.68 --> 1945.68]  takes and i know you could say that the 6 plus or the 6s plus is kind of the endurance model but i
[1945.68 --> 1952.64]  don't want a phablet and i especially don't want a phablet that's extremely difficult to hold on to the
[1952.64 --> 1959.28]  way that the iphone 6 plus is so anyway this it's not out yet this is just a patent that they're applying
[1959.28 --> 1967.44]  for for a headphone jack called the d jack um yeah it's like what is elon musk running apple now like
[1967.44 --> 1976.96]  really um i'd prefer it that way it looks like the d jack might fit in other phones so it could be
[1976.96 --> 1984.88]  yeah like when you look at the shape it looks like it could work oh um interesting so maybe maybe it's
[1984.88 --> 1990.40]  okay but uh i don't know like but you're basically you're going to be buying new headphones and the
[1990.40 --> 1995.36]  thing about headphones is i really believe in investing in a great pair of headphones yeah and
[1995.36 --> 2003.12]  then using them for a long time because frankly audio technology it's improving i usually swap them
[2003.12 --> 2014.40]  out when they like break yeah and that's fine because the hd 600s are still great yep and you could buy 650s
[2014.40 --> 2024.00]  or 700s but the 600s are still great um and with iem's i would say this is maybe less true like over the last
[2024.00 --> 2029.60]  five years i don't think there's been a ton of innovation but in the last 20 there's been a lot
[2029.60 --> 2037.76]  yeah um but a lot of innovation there is like not even necessarily innovation yeah inline control
[2037.76 --> 2044.08]  inline controls ribbon cables yeah nicer nicer fitting things to go in your ears wireless for example oh
[2044.08 --> 2050.32]  speaking of wireless um i've actually got i might actually oh i never really told jbird that i was
[2050.32 --> 2055.20]  thinking of this because i wasn't at the time but this could work they offered to send me the x2s
[2055.20 --> 2059.60]  because um i don't know if you remember this but i i reviewed the blue buds x loved them i know someone
[2059.60 --> 2064.40]  who bought them and then they broke like right out of their warranty period really yep mine are still
[2064.40 --> 2072.00]  going strong that's a bummer yeah anyway okay well at any rate i got slammed for that i was like i don't
[2072.00 --> 2078.00]  even know what these are because i never yeah so they reached out about sending over the x2s for review and i was
[2078.00 --> 2083.68]  like yeah we like we we don't do that much audio stuff these days yeah like linus tech tips is
[2083.68 --> 2090.64]  transitioning into more like like a show and there are reviews but we're kind of saving it for for
[2090.64 --> 2096.80]  marquee products oh okay well i mean you guys have probably noticed things like moving vlog no we're
[2096.80 --> 2103.28]  the most hardcore tech review site on the planet yeah we only do motherboard bios we don't review anything
[2103.28 --> 2110.48]  else motherboard bios yeah yeah yeah okay i haven't fired you in a long time that's true but i think
[2110.48 --> 2115.44]  that kind of merits it you can't when we're the most hardcore tech review channel on the internet
[2115.44 --> 2118.56]  you can't fire me wow
[2121.60 --> 2127.60]  so anyway i wasn't sure if i was going to do a review so i basically said well you can send them if you want
[2127.60 --> 2134.24]  no guarantees yeah and they're like yeah we'll take that we'll roll that die and then i also this
[2134.24 --> 2142.16]  was a product that i backed a billion years ago when i was kind of getting into doing iem videos and uh
[2142.80 --> 2150.48]  and it's the dash do you remember the dash no okay so this is a battery powered in here right yeah and
[2150.48 --> 2155.60]  it's supposed to have like not necessarily great battery life but it's supposed to be like super small
[2155.60 --> 2161.04]  so i backed that on like kickstarter or indiegogo or whatever ages ago so i could do a head-to-head
[2161.04 --> 2166.08]  cool so maybe i'll do that that should be pretty cool so i can take the original blue buds x i can
[2166.08 --> 2171.44]  take the x2s and i can take the dash and i can play some badminton and it'll be an excuse to bring a
[2171.44 --> 2176.56]  camera crew out and get like some wicked cool like slow-mo footage of me playing badminton so i like
[2176.56 --> 2184.08]  i like go for that i go for that shot and like the sweat drips off my my forehead can we get like the
[2184.08 --> 2190.88]  stupid glamour shots oh i think we should yeah hey brandon would that be fun do you want to come
[2190.88 --> 2195.68]  and like hang with me and get some like action footage like slow-mo action footage me playing
[2195.68 --> 2202.16]  badminton like testing wireless earbuds well i don't know whenever okay brandon's down brandon's
[2202.16 --> 2207.92]  down so we're totally doing it um what are we talking about are you ready to do your thing uh no
[2207.92 --> 2212.96]  are you ever going to be ready to do your thing yes not on the show today though probably
[2215.04 --> 2219.84]  probably i just gave you like every possible conditional answer but they were actually
[2219.84 --> 2225.04]  accurate i'm not ready right now i will be ready at some point probably on this show so our relationship
[2225.04 --> 2234.00]  is complicated as your friend i could slap you yep as your employer i can't slap you so wait as your
[2234.00 --> 2242.16]  lover i shouldn't slap you but maybe but could if you were into it yeah um so i'm just so i'm slapping
[2242.16 --> 2248.80]  myself oh wow so say if you wait four minutes we won't technically be on work time but we're still on
[2248.80 --> 2257.84]  work premises yes so and and i mean we could do stuff anywhere that's true so i gotta speaking of
[2257.84 --> 2266.00]  which i gotta get lines for my office just make lunch time that much better i am finally moving
[2266.00 --> 2271.28]  into my office i have set up the mineral oil computer yeah much to luke's sadness that was
[2271.28 --> 2274.40]  really depressing that was the saddest acknowledgement of anything ever
[2276.72 --> 2281.36]  because he straight up asked he was like can i have the oil pc for my workstation
[2282.08 --> 2286.56]  like right when we built it yeah and then also when we moved in here and probably a few times in
[2286.56 --> 2290.96]  between there and so my initial response was maybe we'll use it as like a set piece or something
[2290.96 --> 2296.72]  because it's super cool looking and then it just sat on the oven in the kitchen gathering dust and
[2296.72 --> 2302.80]  dust sits in the oil and then it can cycle into the system for literally months for literally months
[2302.80 --> 2308.88]  and then finally he moved in and he asked me again and i was like no i'm using it and his world
[2308.88 --> 2316.24]  was crushed and i could tell and it was good no it wasn't it wasn't good because there there were
[2316.24 --> 2323.04]  there i don't know it's it's one of those things where it's like the ceo's office i think should
[2323.04 --> 2330.08]  have like the showpiece technically if we want to go with like new age companies the ceo should probably
[2330.08 --> 2335.60]  be on the floor with the other employees because it creates a better more healthy work environment
[2335.60 --> 2341.60]  see what you're doing hiding yourself in the top corner giving yourself a private office is more archaic
[2342.16 --> 2348.00]  old forms of running companies what is this really efficient for today's uh management structures
[2348.00 --> 2353.60]  okay which are actually more flat than your vertical structure about putting yourself on the top and
[2353.60 --> 2358.40]  maybe naming the company after yourself it's more of an antiquated system it's not really recommended
[2358.40 --> 2365.28]  for starting new companies but i guess you know you could do that so this is the same guy that needs me to
[2365.28 --> 2371.12]  build him like a fortress of solitude upstairs because he finds having one person or because
[2371.12 --> 2376.88]  even though we've been here for months the library isn't ready one person or that one person in in the
[2376.88 --> 2383.12]  room with him is it's too much i can't focus i need my own room and i need active noise cancelling
[2383.12 --> 2387.44]  headphones didn't require my own room wanted to do it in the public library needed noise cancelling
[2387.44 --> 2392.16]  headphones public library is not ready the library actually is pretty much ready to go it needs to be
[2392.16 --> 2397.04]  cleaned yeah i've been told to not work in there yeah it needs to be tidied up we're almost we're
[2397.04 --> 2401.68]  almost ready to go we're almost ready to go in there uh so why don't we move on to an actual news
[2401.68 --> 2409.68]  topic here north america is out of ipv4 addresses and i know that you've been tied up on something else
[2409.68 --> 2414.48]  and you haven't had a ton of time to uh to dock it up here so why don't i do the quick summary okay and
[2414.48 --> 2419.84]  then you can talk a little bit about the implications of this so there it is for really real this time
[2419.84 --> 2426.08]  uh there's been an awful lot of crying wolf on this subject over the years you know oh well we're
[2426.08 --> 2432.88]  out of the ones that can be assigned to the assignment authority or we're out of the ones that can be
[2432.88 --> 2442.48]  pre-allocated except in circumstances where we could allocate some more and no no it is happening and it
[2442.48 --> 2451.20]  is time for everyone to start switching to ipv6 now we've actually talked about this on tech quickie
[2451.20 --> 2460.72]  before and the complicated thing here is that ipv4 and ipv6 so ipv4 is that up to 12 digit number okay with
[2460.72 --> 2470.96]  periods every usually three digits okay and ipv6 is like alphanumeric and longer and while ipv4 can have
[2470.96 --> 2476.80]  something along the lines of i believe it's four billion addresses ipv6 can literally have enough
[2476.80 --> 2483.68]  addresses for like 340 undecillion yeah so it's something along the lines of one followed by 36
[2483.68 --> 2490.64]  zeros so i think that's something along the lines of two ipv6 addresses for every square inch of earth
[2491.36 --> 2496.56]  or something like that like it's it's it's ludicrous okay someone's telling me it's more than that so the
[2496.56 --> 2506.16]  the point is that we need to switch but the problem is that if your website for example linusmediagroup.com
[2506.16 --> 2516.32]  is not ipv6 then ipv6 clients can have trouble and if your website is not backwards compatible with ipv4
[2516.96 --> 2523.20]  then ipv4 clients can have trouble accessing your ipv6 website they're not they don't talk to each other
[2523.20 --> 2533.52]  very well and there are like interposer methods but they suck yeah so there's not honestly a ton that
[2533.52 --> 2539.28]  you're gonna have to worry about if you're watching this show i can basically guarantee you your router
[2539.28 --> 2547.12]  is able to handle ipv6 um i'm just gonna kind of leave it at that and there's not really a ton else you
[2547.12 --> 2551.84]  need to do if you again if you're watching this show it's basically a guarantee that your computer is
[2551.84 --> 2556.96]  ready for this yes and that your network is ready for this most smartphones are ready for this um the
[2556.96 --> 2563.68]  the issue is really on the on the website server side and on the internet service provider side again
[2564.56 --> 2569.60]  most of those are gonna be fine and there are a few things that you're gonna have to learn like um
[2569.60 --> 2576.32]  you know if you're working on your lan you're probably using ipv4 addresses you know 192.168 or
[2576.32 --> 2582.96]  10.20. whatever um so you're probably gonna want to switch to ipv6 addresses which means there's
[2582.96 --> 2587.20]  gonna be a bit of a learning curve there yeah i haven't actually a lot more annoying to remember
[2587.20 --> 2593.36]  yes mike which sucks way more annoying to remember yep the good news is that if they have a lot of
[2593.36 --> 2599.84]  zeros in them you can actually shorten them and you don't have to remember the zeros so that will help
[2599.84 --> 2613.12]  a little bit i guess um and and you don't have to deal with subnetting anymore so okay although 255.255.255.255.0
[2613.12 --> 2619.76]  it's pretty not hard which usually auto populates like every time it's not that big of a deal like
[2619.76 --> 2627.20]  every time yeah and unless you're doing more unless you're kind of like a networking guy or gal you're
[2627.20 --> 2632.56]  really not working with anything more complicated than that anyway but it's coming for networking
[2632.56 --> 2639.92]  people this might change things up tell me this are we ready for ipv6 uh we might need to change a few
[2639.92 --> 2645.20]  things but it won't be a problem at all okay well there you go our like websites and stuff are fine
[2645.20 --> 2650.96]  cool yeah like internally if you want to start managing things as ipv6 you'll maybe need to change
[2650.96 --> 2656.32]  things right but everything else is fine this is cool i just got confirmation i am getting a review
[2656.32 --> 2663.04]  sample of the new moto 360. yay it looks nice it does look really nice yeah it's a 60 day unit so
[2663.04 --> 2667.20]  i'll have to send it back if i even if i really like it i'll just have to buy one but uh you know
[2667.92 --> 2674.00]  it looks nice i think austin gets to keep this yeah i'm i'm sure i'm sure he does um it looks nice
[2674.72 --> 2682.24]  yeah i know it looks nice but it might be too nice for me um i actually like the kind of sports watch
[2682.24 --> 2688.88]  look of the g watch are so i may not want to switch anyway and i'm really going to have to uh i'm
[2688.88 --> 2697.28]  really going to have to look closely at what significant difference there really is from this
[2697.92 --> 2703.28]  android wear device to another one because as far as i can tell no one has really done with android
[2703.28 --> 2708.64]  wear what they've done with android where they try to enhance the experience for better or for worse
[2708.64 --> 2720.72]  um so to me it really seems like up till now um oh up until now one android wear watch is kind of an
[2720.72 --> 2725.92]  android wear watch and you know what i probably won't be doing it until after i do the apple watch again
[2725.92 --> 2733.36]  anyway because uh watch os 2 just dropped and i will be doing an iphone 6s review so i'll be using
[2733.36 --> 2742.96]  those two devices together in the meantime nick is nick is giving me updates which is which is
[2743.92 --> 2748.48]  totally the most professional thing for the on-screen talent to be doing in the middle of a video podcast
[2748.48 --> 2754.80]  but i'm getting close to my thing doesn't the show look great i think it looks great i think you look
[2754.80 --> 2760.32]  great i think you look great i think we both look great and check this out i had so many people whining
[2760.32 --> 2766.48]  about the uh the plosives that i have installed a pop filter so the audio should actually be better
[2766.48 --> 2773.12]  this week too now i did run around before the show and try to find my arm mount um so that we could
[2773.12 --> 2778.40]  have a suspension mount for the microphone for now we're settling with a folded up t-shirt under it
[2779.04 --> 2784.40]  but but that'll come that'll come eventually we are finally in what i believe will be the
[2784.40 --> 2792.16]  lan shows forever home this computer needs to be reformatted yeah but this equipment actually see
[2792.16 --> 2798.96]  we even we even put a sticker on it desk that's not as gross i kind of like it because the background's
[2798.96 --> 2805.52]  kind of gross too oh well we can change it i kind of want like a wood top desk has far too much real
[2805.52 --> 2811.28]  estate as well yeah okay yeah we can tweak things like my head gets chopped off by the logo that was
[2811.28 --> 2816.64]  always me you just your head got chopped my head was my head always had the logo on it really yeah
[2816.64 --> 2823.60]  on the couch oh yeah it totally did that seems silly yeah well either way we shouldn't probably
[2823.60 --> 2828.08]  have the screen taking up that much space oh why were these rejected but it's all right reason too boring
[2828.80 --> 2833.52]  who who determines whether news is boring or not that's pretty boring i'm doing you know what you're
[2833.52 --> 2841.60]  boring you're boring wow okay sponsors lynda.com a huge shout out to lynda.com for sponsoring the
[2841.60 --> 2848.72]  wanshow um and you know what this actually is only semi-related to lynda.com but my wife was talking to
[2848.72 --> 2852.40]  me because i actually brought this up on the wanshow it's something i talked to my wife about a fair bit
[2852.40 --> 2858.80]  and that is limiting screen time for my kids okay um and she kind of goes well hold on a second like
[2860.16 --> 2868.80]  my son actually he's three and he is almost reading like he can actually read fairly simple words that
[2868.80 --> 2875.68]  good that he's never seen before yes okay so at his pre-preschool orientation the teacher said that
[2875.68 --> 2883.44]  she had a student once that knew the entire alphabet so my son has known the entire alphabet
[2883.44 --> 2888.56]  and all of the phonetic letters of the l and all the phonetic sounds of the letters since he was two
[2889.12 --> 2897.92]  and that is a in huge part thanks to youtube youtube is a great teaching tool and i like to sleep in i was
[2897.92 --> 2905.44]  gonna say like mind games on the ds or um there's tons of teaching math blaster going back to my
[2905.44 --> 2910.88]  childhood so yeah so that's how this ties into lynda anyway so i'm getting there so she basically
[2910.88 --> 2918.08]  goes well hold on a second so like you talk a lot about the importance of programming and 3d modeling
[2918.08 --> 2924.80]  skills in the new world and i go yes and she goes well so what are you just going to stunt his growth
[2924.80 --> 2934.64]  and i kind of go no one he's three and i really think three-year-olds don't necessarily need to be
[2934.64 --> 2941.04]  working on those skills yet he could start when he's four or five or six i think at the age he's
[2941.04 --> 2946.56]  at right now he needs to learn other things like my my son doesn't have trouble sitting still i don't
[2946.56 --> 2952.88]  need him to learn how to sit still it's actually like he's like military trained he's it's really
[2952.88 --> 2960.88]  impressive if you're like you know little man i sit there do this for a bit he goes he says he does it
[2960.88 --> 2968.16]  then unlock him yeah so i i want him working on you know going to stay and play which is a local
[2968.16 --> 2972.96]  program where you just go and like run around and throw balls with other kids and stuff like that
[2972.96 --> 2977.84]  those are the skills that he needs to work on right now and and it's one of those things where there is
[2977.84 --> 2983.68]  no hard and fast rule you have to tailor the approach depending on the kid and i don't think he
[2983.68 --> 2990.56]  needs a ton of screen time right now period but that doesn't mean that i don't want him because
[2990.56 --> 2996.72]  he's gonna he's gonna hit kindergarten already knowing probably up to multiplication and division
[2996.72 --> 3003.36]  like he's a smart kid and so kindergarten is going to be a super duper waste of his time so when he comes
[3003.36 --> 3009.68]  home i don't expect him to do his you know yellow plus blue equals green homework that's stupid he's he
[3009.68 --> 3017.68]  knows that stuff already um i expect him to be working on computer skills yeah and honestly i have
[3017.68 --> 3025.92]  fallen behind i have spent the last 10 years of my life working on product management and business and
[3025.92 --> 3033.68]  uh online content creation and it's not like i don't have technology skills but luke can attest to this
[3033.68 --> 3043.12]  i am embarrassing when it comes to any kind of programming like i can barely bold and unbold something
[3044.40 --> 3051.76]  in a text editor okay i can but barely um like i'm can't claim much either
[3053.84 --> 3059.52]  but yeah but you went to school for it at least like you know something like the games changed a bit
[3059.52 --> 3065.20]  and like a lot of what i went to school for where i like wasn't working full time with you and not
[3065.20 --> 3070.72]  really going to school as much as i should have maybe been um was a little bit more antiquated
[3070.72 --> 3076.16]  stuff that no one's really using anymore so i do want him working on that stuff and it's a great
[3076.16 --> 3082.40]  opportunity this is one of the things that a lot of parents do is it's like this is my second crack
[3082.40 --> 3088.00]  at learning this stuff with my kids because it'll keep us talking the same language and it'll be an
[3088.00 --> 3092.96]  opportunity for me to bond with my kid which i have to do anyway and pick up some new skills while
[3092.96 --> 3100.24]  i'm at it so this finally ties in to lynda.com a great resource for learning things online whether
[3100.24 --> 3106.96]  it's programming or video editing skills or what's cool about this is say say you were deciding to
[3106.96 --> 3112.48]  give your kid x amount of time to learn whatever he wants but he has to learn something on the computer
[3112.48 --> 3117.92]  he could go on lynda and look up so much stuff yep and go on his own pace and do whatever
[3117.92 --> 3122.80]  he could download them onto his phone or whatever he wanted or he could even do the like kitty boo
[3122.80 --> 3130.96]  version you know kids first 3d modeling program and if i'm trying to follow along with him i'll have
[3130.96 --> 3135.76]  a deep enough understanding that i can help him with these things as well like that's what i really want
[3135.76 --> 3142.00]  because i look at the curriculum at least here in canada anyway and it seems like we're really falling
[3142.00 --> 3146.96]  behind you know there's nothing in the news about canadian schools looking at introducing programming
[3147.60 --> 3152.88]  um to young kids and and it feels like this is the kind of thing that they did a good job with our
[3152.88 --> 3159.68]  generation i learned how to use a spreadsheet and how to use you know office applications and how to use
[3159.68 --> 3165.60]  a printer like skills that we take for granted now not because they happen by magic but because they
[3165.60 --> 3170.88]  freaking covered it we had access to the equipment like my wife was like oh this school is getting a
[3170.88 --> 3176.16]  3d printer it seems expensive i'm like well yeah how much do you think the computer lab cost at your
[3176.16 --> 3181.44]  elementary school so much right yeah because they were investing in it answering entire schools at
[3181.44 --> 3187.52]  that point i know and there's and and that is a thing but that doesn't mean they didn't spend anything
[3187.52 --> 3192.64]  on it it doesn't mean they didn't spend the resources on hiring or training the teachers to be
[3192.64 --> 3197.44]  to be covering this stuff and did they do a perfect job no but it's better than nothing and at least
[3197.44 --> 3202.32]  you like inspire the kids and then they can go home or go somewhere else and learn from there
[3202.32 --> 3205.76]  because like i know a lot of people that as long as they're introduced to a topic if they're truly
[3205.76 --> 3210.24]  that interested they can go the rest of the way and they kind of have to yeah and that's how you're
[3210.24 --> 3218.16]  gonna get really good at anything so anyway lynda.com is gonna be my tool to keep in touch i guess with
[3218.16 --> 3222.80]  with what my kids are up to it starts at only 25 a month and you can get a 10-day free trial at
[3222.80 --> 3228.00]  lynda.com when show you can learn all kinds of great stuff and i guess that's that's pretty much
[3228.00 --> 3231.92]  all i have to say about that that was the longest sponsor spot we've ever done what are you doing
[3231.92 --> 3237.68]  the watermark's gone oh oh yes the watermark is gone during the sponsor spots that's so weird because
[3237.68 --> 3246.56]  i didn't put it in so learn to deal our second sponsor today is one that i sincerely hope i get to
[3246.56 --> 3250.24]  experience with my kids someday well not not both of them
[3253.60 --> 3260.80]  well um i guess there are things that girls can shave but their legs like their legs i but in the
[3260.80 --> 3267.44]  context of my children i really don't like i'm not gonna it's a father-son thing shaving the face
[3267.44 --> 3272.40]  i got it it's nothing to do with daughters if they're gonna shave their legs they i don't they
[3272.40 --> 3277.44]  learn that on their own oh no they learn that's kind of crap with their girlfriends right i don't
[3277.44 --> 3283.60]  why why are you asking me i don't know like i would ask the ladies in the audience to tell me like
[3284.40 --> 3290.48]  you know their mom i don't know do mom and daughter get together and like shave their legs you can show
[3290.48 --> 3298.48]  her how to shave like her shin shin wear shorts yeah i don't know man um anyway without getting into
[3298.48 --> 3304.56]  too much detail like i would be surprised if it's like hey mom my my dress is catching on my shin hair
[3306.16 --> 3311.12]  i don't know do you even know any females
[3313.76 --> 3320.24]  my dress is catching on my shin hair not really no i don't let's move on can we update harry potter's uh
[3320.24 --> 3328.32]  speech bubble my probably we need like a ron weasley it's not a dress it's a robe or like
[3328.32 --> 3332.48]  a hermione we should we should get the whole team and just speech bubble all of them and they can
[3332.48 --> 3339.92]  just mock me all the time they're expensive really that was like 60 bucks whoa yeah it was completely
[3339.92 --> 3346.56]  unreasonable it's just carpool i know it's probably a licensing thing though like probably 30 dollars
[3346.56 --> 3353.20]  because that's like to joan rowling yeah yeah yeah that's definitely the movie asset yes thing like
[3353.20 --> 3359.12]  that's on a poster somewhere so anyway these are the worst sponsor spots we've ever done but or the
[3359.12 --> 3366.24]  best whatever the point is dollar shave club i want to use dollar shave club razors to shave with my son
[3366.24 --> 3372.72]  because they're high quality they're affordable and they ship them directly to your door once a month
[3372.72 --> 3379.12]  you know what dollar shave club needs okay because okay okay this is a suggestion i hope dollar
[3379.12 --> 3383.36]  shave club is watching this because they've got a lot of great products they've got the razors they've
[3383.36 --> 3389.52]  got the aftershave they've got the um they've got the shave butter uh and they've got the one wipe charlies
[3389.52 --> 3395.12]  so you can clean up the look of your face you can clean up the smell of your face you can clean up both
[3395.12 --> 3401.76]  the look and smell of your butthole but what you can't what you can't maintain with dollar shave club
[3401.76 --> 3409.28]  and what i would argue is just as important if not more so to have delivered monthly your armpits
[3410.08 --> 3417.36]  dollar shave club needs to add deodorant to their arsenal because there should be no excuse for
[3417.36 --> 3422.72]  smelling bad and that's what dollar shave club is all about you don't have to leave the house to look
[3422.72 --> 3427.84]  like you're presentable enough to leave the house you know one white charlies yes they need to make like
[3427.84 --> 3433.20]  one armpit de-smeller charlies that could even work because you keep it in the car or something and
[3433.20 --> 3438.00]  then you're like crap i forgot yes you'd be like all right well this date isn't gonna fail i got this
[3438.00 --> 3444.32]  like a sponge bath charlie or something like that anyway the point is dollarshaveclub.com
[3444.32 --> 3450.56]  linus join the club if you always want to look presentable and always shave with a fresh razor to
[3450.56 --> 3455.52]  so you can do a good job and all that all that kind of stuff and it's affordable and they deliver
[3455.52 --> 3460.72]  it to your house and stuff all right so we've got probably a fair bit more to talk about on the
[3460.72 --> 3465.92]  show here today even though technically like it's quarter after six but we did start pretty late not
[3465.92 --> 3475.76]  like i have anything to do this is a pretty big deal it's okay that's not really funny um oh just keep
[3475.76 --> 3483.44]  going so i've had a lot of comments and i've seen a lot of comments about people calling acetech
[3483.44 --> 3491.12]  remember they were the original lc-lc the low cost liquid cooler just the best name before yeah i know
[3491.12 --> 3498.56]  before they partnered with everyone under the sun uh you know corsair and uh um nzxt and like all
[3498.56 --> 3505.92]  these guys to co-brand their lc-lc product and i've had a lot of people running around calling acetech
[3505.92 --> 3513.76]  a patent troll for protecting their intellectual property in the u.s their idea their patent of
[3513.76 --> 3521.68]  putting a pump on a cpu block this is not trolling so it has now been up they got pretty roughly
[3521.68 --> 3529.20]  ripped off they did like a lot they did and and it didn't happen right away but now that it's happening
[3529.20 --> 3535.20]  they are pretty aggressively going after first it was cool it and now it is cooler master and they
[3535.20 --> 3540.16]  are seeking actually as first it was uh first it was cool it then it was swift tech and now it's
[3540.16 --> 3547.44]  cooler master or whatever the order it happened in i don't care so they are seeking damages for
[3547.44 --> 3554.88]  people ripping off their idea and their design and now it has been confirmed so not just once but twice
[3554.88 --> 3563.12]  at asatech has won their patent infringement case against cmi a subsidiary of cooler master so the
[3563.12 --> 3568.96]  first time around they were awarded a 14 and a half percent royalty rate on every infringing cooler
[3568.96 --> 3577.28]  master product being sold cmi demanded a judgment as a matter of law and a new trial and they have now
[3577.28 --> 3586.32]  been awarded enhanced damages of 25.375 per unit so for all revenues on infringing products starting
[3586.32 --> 3592.96]  january 1st 2015. it is still appealable by cmi but i really gotta wonder if they're gonna go back for
[3592.96 --> 3603.52]  more at this point do i like that this patent doesn't allow anyone to put a pump on a block and
[3603.52 --> 3610.16]  this is in the u.s to be clear like in canada these products are still for sale um do i like that
[3610.80 --> 3619.36]  not really it does stifle innovation do i believe that there was a ton of innovation to be done
[3619.92 --> 3626.88]  in the all-in-one liquid cooler not really the performance hasn't really changed dramatically in
[3626.88 --> 3632.24]  the last five years how big is your radiator if we had a product that worked fine
[3632.24 --> 3638.88]  and was a reasonable price and asa tech was selling it and they were making their margin and corsair was
[3638.88 --> 3644.40]  rebranding it and they were making their margin and and we had an ecosystem that kind of worked and it
[3644.40 --> 3651.60]  was you know the consumers were happy to pay that price um does anyone benefit from someone coming in
[3651.60 --> 3664.32]  and doing something very similar uh and infringing someone else's patent i don't i don't know that
[3664.32 --> 3671.60]  that is getting into some pretty uh i was getting and like to be clear like there is there is sort of
[3671.60 --> 3678.56]  there is similar and then there is very similar and i can't find the link now unfortunately but uh i saw an
[3678.56 --> 3687.60]  internal shot of uh one of cooler masters uh cpu block slash pump combo units and asa techs and wow is
[3687.60 --> 3696.40]  the construction really close because the reality of it is in software you can go closed source okay in
[3697.04 --> 3705.12]  uh chip design you can not really show people you know how it all how it's all working and you can hide
[3705.12 --> 3710.88]  a lot of special sauce but physical products patents are the only thing that protects it it's the only
[3710.88 --> 3716.32]  thing that prevents you know someone from saying oh hey that's pretty cool i'll just make that exact
[3716.32 --> 3723.36]  thing yeah yay now i have it and also it's cheaper because i didn't have to do any r d work i didn't have
[3723.36 --> 3729.04]  to lay the groundwork for the acceptance of this product because that was a real thing i was around when
[3729.04 --> 3735.92]  the lc-lc first launched i was one of the first people to order them and not order one personally
[3735.92 --> 3744.72]  but to order them for stock i sat in the ncix warehouse for days and took bulk orders of lc-lcs
[3745.60 --> 3752.96]  and repackaged them into boxes i had to like cut the packing material to size i had to i had to baggy all
[3752.96 --> 3758.16]  the mounting screws because it was it was designed for oems and system integrators and i i turned the
[3758.16 --> 3767.36]  lc-lc into a retail product before anyone else i was there and i know that the beginning wasn't smooth
[3767.92 --> 3773.20]  it wasn't always as simple as hey we'll bring this product to market and a bajillion people will buy it
[3773.20 --> 3782.16]  asatech invested in making this a viable product category and cooler master didn't at least not then and
[3782.16 --> 3790.48]  not certainly not to the same extent so i get it um but i mean it does it does suck that you know it's
[3791.52 --> 3796.40]  like competition is good and i'm not saying competition is ever bad i i'm just saying there's
[3796.40 --> 3801.52]  another side to the coin and it does look like the court was right in this case i do not consider
[3801.52 --> 3807.20]  acetech to be a patent troll especially because the technology that they're patenting is something
[3807.20 --> 3812.08]  that they're actively selling and have as far as i've been able to tell been somewhat reasonable
[3812.08 --> 3816.80]  about so it's not like you can't buy it they're not just it's not like that
[3816.80 --> 3825.92]  bullshit that happened to puget systems where some guy wow some guy patented something to do with
[3825.92 --> 3832.56]  mineral oil submerged submersion computers and then basically prevented puget systems from being able to
[3832.56 --> 3838.96]  sell their kit right around the time that we did our mineral oil build blog that was bullshit because
[3838.96 --> 3843.68]  that company is not selling it it was not a viable business idea that they had in the first place
[3843.68 --> 3849.28]  they went under and now they're just sitting around being a patent troll as a tax not being a troll
[3849.28 --> 3855.76]  literally one person no one else was doing this and it was a very small passion project thing they
[3855.76 --> 3864.72]  weren't really making money no like i like man the call that i had was so depressing it was so depressing he was just like
[3864.72 --> 3872.08]  like yeah so bad news we your last video is going up that's cool that's great we actually cannot sell
[3872.08 --> 3880.08]  these anymore so yeah like you know this is something we've been working on for like eight years or
[3880.08 --> 3884.56]  whatever just because we think it's cool and like done a really good job on it they're the reason why i got
[3884.56 --> 3890.56]  into it i saw one of their really early systems possibly their first one at pax way back in the day and
[3890.56 --> 3896.24]  was like what the hell is that i even remember very specifically grabbing the display cable and
[3896.24 --> 3900.96]  tracing it with my hand to like make sure that it was actually doing what i thought it was yeah because
[3900.96 --> 3905.04]  i didn't believe it at all and then talked to the dude for like a while and then was totally
[3906.08 --> 3912.16]  super interested and then went did my own thing and like yeah so i'm pretty buddies with them a million
[3912.16 --> 3920.24]  a million views on uh on youtube of your rig that you built based on that encounter yeah yeah 1.1 million there it
[3920.24 --> 3926.32]  is so this is for those of you who haven't seen it oh no sorry no 1.1 million is our project yeah
[3926.32 --> 3931.76]  yeah um the poor yeah of course that's going to be the uh that's going to be the one um so no but
[3931.76 --> 3937.36]  it's still that's almost a million views and that's back in the day too so this is luke's rig that he built
[3937.36 --> 3942.88]  based on that cool encounter with uh puget systems like the same fish tank that they did i found it at
[3942.88 --> 3949.92]  freaking pet smart near my parents house like this was super cool and like hella inspired by them i just
[3949.92 --> 3956.80]  couldn't pay the uh import duties over the border yeah it is expensive yeah so like it's it's a lot
[3956.80 --> 3964.56]  of exactly what they did to be completely honest um so yeah so yeah it's it's lame for anyone who
[3964.56 --> 3971.12]  whose name is cooler master yep um you know but let's see yeah this is this is kind of scary it could
[3971.12 --> 3977.20]  impact the fury x yeah uh because those are using in an infringing design with the pump and block
[3977.20 --> 3983.92]  integrated so it's going to be an interesting little bit it doesn't look like ek's new design
[3983.92 --> 3989.12]  infringes on it because it integrates the pump into the radiator which hurts case compatibility so i can
[3989.12 --> 3996.72]  understand why not everyone does it but there you go all right next up this is going to be cool for the
[3996.72 --> 4006.16]  uh for the film equipment buffs red's new raven camera will start at six thousand dollars and shoot 4k up to
[4006.16 --> 4016.64]  120 frames per second now i'm going to run through a few things here that are pretty cool so it uses
[4016.64 --> 4022.80]  the dragon sensor so this is by far the lowest cost you've been able to get at a dragon sensor
[4023.52 --> 4029.76]  it's available with an ef mount so you can use your canon lenses cool it takes mini mags which are their
[4029.76 --> 4036.08]  um their proprietary media very expensive which i guess is leading into how things are starting to
[4036.08 --> 4041.20]  happen naming for things it has a nice lightweight construction it's it's relatively small the uh it's
[4041.20 --> 4046.96]  got the same body as the weapon all the weapon modules work it has built-in wi-fi it has a built-in
[4046.96 --> 4051.60]  microphone which is useful for audio syncing if nothing else even if it's not going to be like a good
[4051.60 --> 4060.00]  quality one but this uh this uh no film school sub headline here is the gotcha here while the body is
[4060.00 --> 4065.04]  six thousand dollars the way that red sells their bodies and i'm going to see if i can find a picture of
[4065.04 --> 4071.92]  the body here and that yeah there it is the way that red sells their bodies is with nothing on it this
[4071.92 --> 4085.44]  has no display it has no uh actual on camera buttons to control it it has no um xlr audio input i kind of
[4085.44 --> 4094.96]  love it it has it's just so absurd it has nothing it is the brain like brandon who really loves doing
[4094.96 --> 4100.24]  these really intricate configurations of things i'm sure he would love that yes but there are certain
[4100.24 --> 4105.60]  things that should really be on the camera i'm not trying to get into his head buying a red don't worry
[4105.60 --> 4111.36]  about that yeah well i don't think i don't think brandon even wants one hey brandon do you even want a
[4111.36 --> 4118.40]  to raven um not for our stuff he says not for our stuff because there's a lot there's a lot of
[4119.20 --> 4126.16]  there's a lot of issues like it's it's cool that it can record um pro res which is which is awesome
[4126.16 --> 4130.32]  but there's the fact that you're locked into this proprietary media the fact that once you've bought
[4130.32 --> 4136.24]  into the red ecosystem you've got all these accessories and like batteries and all this stuff that's just
[4136.24 --> 4143.04]  just straight up not useful for other things necessarily um and it looks like it's going to
[4143.04 --> 4149.44]  cost you at least 10 grand to get started as opposed to six grand and and realistically if you
[4149.44 --> 4155.76]  want to add some of the modules that you're probably going to need um you're looking at closer to 15 000
[4155.76 --> 4162.64]  dollars so it's it's not actually that competitive with some of the newer cameras out from the likes of
[4162.64 --> 4169.12]  uh of sony for example but it's red but it's red uh but it's red and it's the cheapest we've seen from
[4169.12 --> 4173.92]  them yet for a flagship sensor like that is an impressive sensor i think it's something like 15
[4173.92 --> 4179.60]  and a half stops of dynamic range i want to say i'm like sorry 16 thank you brandon when you're when
[4179.60 --> 4186.72]  your storage device gets full you can ask if anyone has any spare mags okay i know you don't know about
[4186.72 --> 4194.32]  camera stuff and that's fine but zip it what no they're called mini mags i know i know i literally
[4194.32 --> 4202.72]  said an accurate statement i know but you're just trolling me yes i didn't say anything wrong you're a
[4202.72 --> 4209.52]  dick so this is cool it does 1080p at up to 240 frames per second so what i like about this camera is that
[4209.52 --> 4215.84]  at least this starts to put some heat on the other guys to come up with a competitor for the fs700
[4215.84 --> 4222.64]  we've had an fs700 for almost three years now yeah and there is still literally nothing else that is
[4222.64 --> 4228.64]  an obvious direct successor to that camera because there are other ones like the a7r series that do
[4228.64 --> 4234.32]  really great low light um there's other there's the oh man there's there's cameras with better on
[4234.32 --> 4241.28]  camera storage now that's a big thing uh cfast is the new industry standard and is going to be way better
[4241.28 --> 4246.48]  than the the fs700 only has sd cards you have to have an external recorder to use ssds
[4248.00 --> 4253.52]  um there's stuff like way more stops of dynamic range and this is happening from black magic from
[4253.52 --> 4261.60]  sony from from a lot of different guys but the fs700 is is has been almost unique in its ability to
[4261.60 --> 4270.16]  record 240 fps slow-mo now continuously with the third-party external recorder and just for a lot of the
[4270.16 --> 4275.76]  just the balance of features that it has has been difficult to touch for a long time and uh it's
[4275.76 --> 4281.12]  it's finally happening and i hope this continues to light fires under the butts of uh of the other
[4281.12 --> 4286.96]  camera makers out there speaking of other camera makers black magic is sending us an ursa mini and
[4286.96 --> 4295.76]  brandon will be doing for the first time a camera review so stay tuned for that because uh i know he is
[4295.76 --> 4300.48]  pretty stoked on it and he's i'm i believe he's gonna do a great job i believe in you brandon
[4302.24 --> 4310.40]  um man there's a lot of stuff that i would really like to do pretty quickly here um i don't know
[4311.52 --> 4314.56]  did you send out a tweet i think around five i want to say around five
[4315.52 --> 4320.32]  oh why don't we just do everything left as like rapid fire topics okay so here do you want to do the
[4320.32 --> 4326.48]  first one here i've read nothing okay amd preparing dual gpu radeon r9 fury x2 world's
[4326.48 --> 4332.32]  fastest graphics card so uh original article there sorry i have two mice in front of me so it's hard
[4332.32 --> 4338.08]  to remember which is which you know how i'm always kind of salty about sli or crossfire on the show
[4338.08 --> 4346.96]  yes you know how i recently started uh sli 980s yeah yes you know the day that i hooked that up i had a
[4346.96 --> 4352.80]  huge drawn out problem that was unfixable for 24 hours was it related to sli
[4354.80 --> 4360.88]  i hooked my 980s together just before a stream started playing games and stuff and was like okay
[4360.88 --> 4365.20]  cool this was my 24-hour charity stream started playing games everything worked fine i was performing
[4365.20 --> 4368.80]  really well i was like great this is awesome everything's working maybe maybe i'm too salty
[4368.80 --> 4374.08]  about this stuff i remember specifically thinking it is maybe i'm too hard on sli and it is better now
[4374.08 --> 4380.64]  and crossfire yeah not while you're streaming not really a thing has a huge problem with it so
[4380.64 --> 4389.44]  tons of games i couldn't properly play rip and the thing was i was doing a 24-hour charity stream
[4389.44 --> 4396.16]  i know total biscuit runs sli does he live stream while he's running sli i don't know a lot of the
[4396.16 --> 4399.60]  guys that maybe i was doing something wrong i know a lot of the guys did you check with seven
[4399.60 --> 4405.12]  i don't know if he has lies okay interesting i was apparently people were talking apparently
[4405.68 --> 4409.76]  i don't i don't know there's there might be ways around it there might be i don't know all i know
[4409.76 --> 4414.24]  was it was a problem for me and i couldn't change or fix those things because i couldn't stop or restart
[4414.24 --> 4418.56]  the stream right so i was doing a 24-hour charity stream so there might have been some fix that i could
[4418.56 --> 4425.92]  have ran uh something i don't know and we've run into some other dual gp related issues too um without
[4425.92 --> 4432.64]  giving away anything i will say no i can't give away no no no no don't say anything don't say
[4432.64 --> 4438.24]  anything about it a lot of these guys are using capture boxes that are then streaming right right
[4438.24 --> 4443.12]  so it wouldn't matter which is an option yeah but um okay well actually one thing i can say about it
[4443.12 --> 4449.84]  though is an issue that i have particularly with amd's implementation of crossfire is that you actually
[4449.84 --> 4456.64]  can't turn it off on a dual gpu card you can't just you can't just turn it off there is a tool i
[4456.64 --> 4460.88]  forget what it's called catalyst pro or radeon pro or something like that where i think you can force
[4460.88 --> 4468.00]  it off but even that is not necessarily a perfect solution uh seagate has come out and said this
[4468.00 --> 4473.84]  actually happened a couple of weeks ago but i just liked it so much that i wanted to do it ssds will
[4473.84 --> 4483.92]  never match the per gigabyte costs of hard drives okay well we'll see um so he's saying something
[4483.92 --> 4489.76]  something dollar per gigabyte in the upper to 20 to one and something um hard drives match the
[4489.76 --> 4496.88]  performance of ssds no they won't but that's not the point necessarily wow um so interest yeah so i
[4496.88 --> 4501.36]  guess there's not really much else to say about that i just wanted to i just wanted to document that
[4501.36 --> 4507.36]  that that was said as thoroughly as possible very yeah much confident
[4510.80 --> 4518.48]  oculus vr is getting twitch streaming soon what netflix today uh and i believe this article is
[4518.48 --> 4524.16]  from yesterday so yesterday um so yeah they're gonna set up like check this out you're gonna have like a
[4524.16 --> 4529.04]  cool this is actually hulu but you're gonna have like a cool little theater you can sit in it'll be
[4529.04 --> 4536.88]  like a virtual theater experience that is some ba stuff right there so oculus owners have a lot to
[4536.88 --> 4545.84]  look forward to when they become oculus owners yeah um 4chan was sold to the creator of two channel so
[4547.44 --> 4554.96]  uh in in in a series of events that was completely unsurprising to everyone uh 4chan got attacked through
[4554.96 --> 4559.76]  like an imgur exploit and like because the 4chan community
[4562.32 --> 4571.44]  like that thing happened ddos all the things yeah um so there you go uh 4chan was apparently
[4571.44 --> 4576.72]  struggling to be profitable even though they tried a subscription offering and minor advertising and all
[4576.72 --> 4584.32]  that kind of stuff so i get it uh nintendo joins the chronos group ads running right now somewhere on
[4584.32 --> 4591.12]  our stream oh it's probably on one of the sites that we're loading so let me kill them all it better
[4591.12 --> 4597.92]  not be twitch it is not twitch i am killing all the ads there we go all right nintendo has joined chronos
[4597.92 --> 4606.16]  group as a contributor member so these are the guys like a pretty lewd ad actually oh really yeah oh
[4606.96 --> 4615.68]  sorry some team america okay well let's move on um so these are the guys that are maintaining open gl
[4615.68 --> 4624.64]  and vulcan which valve has uh gone all fighting words about and said direct x12 doesn't matter unless
[4624.64 --> 4630.40]  you're like deeply into your direct x12 game development now you should just probably never
[4630.40 --> 4636.40]  touch it and you should just go vulcan because direct x12 doesn't matter and they have some very
[4636.40 --> 4642.96]  good points about uh direct x12 being windows 10 exclusive which was such a mistake i understand that
[4642.96 --> 4649.20]  they would have had to do a bunch of work but like oh and i understand that windows 10 is a free upgrade
[4649.20 --> 4655.36]  for seven and eight owners but like vulcan is gonna work uh across a lot of different platforms
[4655.36 --> 4663.84]  not even just windows so uh would you roll back would i roll back to windows 7 from 10 i need to not
[4663.84 --> 4669.12]  lean backwards yeah would you roll back to windows 7 and use vulcan no because you can use vulcan on 10
[4669.12 --> 4675.04]  i know i know but would you rather use 7 no okay no i i actually like 10 i like the new start menu
[4675.04 --> 4680.56]  yeah yeah new start menu is actually great i actually really like the new start menu um so
[4680.56 --> 4684.48]  anyway nintendo joined which is cool i guess uh
[4688.96 --> 4695.20]  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah this is from wflx an oregon couple trying to resolve a
[4695.20 --> 4698.80]  two million dollar verizon cell phone bill lol
[4698.80 --> 4712.80]  uh what else we got um this is this is really funny the iphone 6s put through its paces in geekbench
[4713.44 --> 4720.00]  uh the dual core 6s obliterates the galaxy s6 note 5 and other top android phones in performance testing
[4720.00 --> 4725.36]  apparently and we've even got some folks running around saying how it's amazing how comparable this is
[4725.36 --> 4732.72]  to the 2015 macbook actually what's amazing is how the 2015 macbook manages to run at literally
[4732.72 --> 4736.96]  half the performance that it could if it wasn't thermal throttling all over the place
[4738.24 --> 4744.88]  yes i mean it is still amazing but like the fact that the macbook is essentially a tablet
[4745.52 --> 4750.88]  in terms of the form factor like in terms of where they actually stuffed the computer okay so so
[4750.88 --> 4755.84]  think about that for a second the fact that apple has been releasing tablets that perform you know
[4756.40 --> 4762.00]  somewhat better than their phones for years now that are also tablets and also in that form factor
[4762.00 --> 4766.16]  and the fact that the macbook is performing literally half as well as that intel chip is
[4766.16 --> 4774.48]  capable of because it's not adequately cooled so no yes the iphone 6s does look like a whiz
[4774.48 --> 4780.48]  banger of a performer and uh and a wicked phone upgrade a whiz banger of a performer whatever um
[4781.04 --> 4788.00]  but that the fact that it's on par with the macbook is not um the fact that the mac it has nothing to
[4788.00 --> 4794.72]  do with the iphone 6s being amazing it has to do with the macbook kind of being a dog so i'm just
[4794.72 --> 4802.00]  throwing that out there you guys i have doom gloom news oh we're ready is it oh kind of ready okay
[4802.64 --> 4808.08]  um all right so should we do this on wanshow or should we do this as kind of a somber after
[4808.08 --> 4812.72]  party and tell people from the wanshow to stick around it's up to you okay let's let's end the
[4812.72 --> 4818.48]  wanshow and we'll be back very shortly stick around especially if you're a member of the linus tech tips
[4818.48 --> 4820.64]  forum
[4820.64 --> 4833.20]  forum oh we were doing so well oh shape club is it even there
