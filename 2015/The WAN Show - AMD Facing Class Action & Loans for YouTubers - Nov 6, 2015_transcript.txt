[0.00 --> 8.02]  What up y'all and welcome to the show. I'm Linus like you don't f-ing no I guess.
[9.30 --> 10.96]  I stole that. I didn't come up with that.
[11.16 --> 14.40]  Yeah. I thought you stole the thing in the pre-show.
[14.48 --> 16.14]  Not that I listened. What? In the pre-show?
[16.32 --> 17.08]  No, not at all.
[17.10 --> 18.52]  What is the joke? Okay, we got an intro.
[18.52 --> 23.84]  Why don't we get into what's going to be on the show today and then we'll get into what we stole and what we came up with on our own.
[23.94 --> 24.48]  Okay, does that sound good?
[24.48 --> 27.88]  We should tell people we have a terrible show coming and see how many people watch.
[27.88 --> 31.36]  Alright, they'll all watch. They'll all watch because they know that there's no such thing-
[31.36 --> 32.62]  We have a horrible show today.
[32.62 --> 37.24]  There's no such thing as a terrible LAN show because the worse it is, the better it gets.
[37.32 --> 38.42]  His voice is gone.
[38.84 --> 39.28]  I know.
[39.48 --> 42.22]  Mine is very clearly here, which is probably a problem.
[42.40 --> 43.34]  Yeah. No, what?
[43.66 --> 44.08]  Oh, sorry.
[46.82 --> 48.56]  Alright, let's just roll the intro.
[57.88 --> 58.72]  Yeah.
[58.72 --> 59.26]  Yeah.
[59.26 --> 59.76]  Yeah.
[72.76 --> 80.00]  All the Twitch- all the Twitch trollers, you guys get rekt. Get rekt today because half of the people are like, there's no sound.
[80.20 --> 82.38]  And the other half are like, lol, Linus's voice.
[82.38 --> 82.88]  Yeah.
[82.88 --> 83.38]  Yeah.
[83.38 --> 85.34]  So, so get rekt, get rekt, yo.
[86.78 --> 88.24]  I got sponsors and stuff.
[88.60 --> 89.44]  Oh, yeah, excuse me.
[89.66 --> 91.86]  I was a little slow on the trigger there, so they're still-
[91.86 --> 92.28]  Yeah, but it looks.
[92.42 --> 93.16]  They're still up there.
[93.76 --> 94.36]  There we go.
[94.40 --> 95.12]  Alright, guys.
[95.94 --> 97.02]  Welcome to the show.
[97.24 --> 98.58]  Should be a good one, actually.
[98.70 --> 100.16]  We've got some great topics today.
[100.28 --> 105.38]  I think the thing on everyone's mind right now is-
[105.38 --> 106.10]  Oh, yeah, right.
[106.24 --> 107.32]  What's on the show today?
[107.50 --> 109.44]  Because we didn't do it prior to the intro.
[109.46 --> 110.42]  Yeah, I was wondering about that.
[110.42 --> 112.30]  I didn't do my hair today either.
[112.42 --> 113.74]  That's probably on everyone's mind, too.
[114.32 --> 116.28]  So, main topics this week.
[116.88 --> 121.10]  We've got Microsoft kills OneDrive unlimited storage.
[121.64 --> 122.04]  Gone.
[122.76 --> 124.10]  The douchiest way ever.
[124.20 --> 124.76]  Yeah, yeah.
[124.94 --> 127.16]  What they did is not popular.
[128.26 --> 129.92]  For a very good reason.
[130.08 --> 130.20]  Yeah.
[130.52 --> 136.04]  YouTube has apparently arranged a loan program for YouTube creators.
[136.52 --> 137.90]  Very interesting.
[138.46 --> 138.98]  What else we got?
[138.98 --> 141.62]  Activision Blizzard to acquire King Digital.
[141.84 --> 143.76]  So, the guys that made Candy Crush.
[143.94 --> 144.20]  Mm-hmm.
[144.52 --> 148.58]  They're like, oh, the top five grossing games, which is Candy Crush and some other version
[148.58 --> 149.36]  of Candy Crush.
[150.18 --> 151.04]  Like, okay.
[151.38 --> 151.82]  Wicked.
[152.32 --> 152.70]  Yeah.
[153.26 --> 154.12]  Super cool.
[154.22 --> 155.68]  I'm very, very happy that you brought that up.
[155.88 --> 160.60]  Also, AMD is facing a class action lawsuit over misrepresentation of a product.
[160.60 --> 163.18]  And we'll have to, we'll dig into what that means a little bit.
[163.28 --> 163.46]  Yes.
[163.46 --> 170.36]  But I think that, I think the thing that's on everyone's mind is why Linus keeps telling
[170.36 --> 172.56]  everyone what's on their minds.
[172.56 --> 179.42]  And the reason for that is because I firmly believe that the thing on everyone's mind is...
[179.42 --> 180.50]  I'm just...
[180.50 --> 181.24]  Where are you going with it?
[181.52 --> 182.00]  Nowhere.
[182.10 --> 182.40]  Okay.
[182.76 --> 184.44]  This whole time I'm like, what?
[185.40 --> 186.82]  What is he talking about?
[186.82 --> 188.48]  He's waiting for it to have a point.
[188.68 --> 188.84]  Yeah.
[188.84 --> 189.80]  Because usually I do.
[189.92 --> 190.16]  Yeah.
[191.04 --> 191.30]  Yeah.
[191.46 --> 192.02]  Not today.
[192.14 --> 193.46]  No, today my point is...
[193.46 --> 194.14]  Not today!
[194.44 --> 195.94]  ...carefully hidden in my trousers.
[196.02 --> 197.78]  There will be no points today.
[199.28 --> 201.26]  It's going to be a soccer game.
[201.36 --> 201.76]  Oh!
[202.16 --> 202.38]  Oh!
[202.80 --> 203.62]  With no ball.
[203.72 --> 205.26]  Does anyone remember that way an episode?
[205.76 --> 206.88]  How long ago was that?
[206.94 --> 207.58]  I don't even know.
[207.90 --> 208.86]  I don't even know.
[208.96 --> 210.30]  I was doing a...
[210.30 --> 211.00]  I was doing...
[211.00 --> 213.00]  I was filming a video or writing a video or something.
[213.52 --> 214.18]  That's my whole life.
[214.30 --> 215.86]  Doing things related to videos.
[215.86 --> 216.98]  And...
[216.98 --> 218.56]  And I was like...
[218.56 --> 219.32]  Blah blah blah something.
[219.44 --> 220.66]  I called it on the WAN show.
[220.88 --> 223.00]  And for a minute I thought to myself...
[223.00 --> 225.14]  I should go try and find that clip so we can play...
[225.14 --> 225.32]  No.
[226.12 --> 226.38]  Nope.
[227.02 --> 227.42]  Nope.
[227.42 --> 228.10]  There is...
[228.10 --> 231.84]  There is literally over a hundred hours of WAN show.
[232.54 --> 238.56]  Someone messaged me on Twitter once saying that he had watched the entire back catalog of WAN show over the previous like...
[238.56 --> 239.38]  Month or something.
[239.62 --> 240.12]  Oh my god.
[240.12 --> 241.90]  And I was just like...
[241.90 --> 242.26]  Why?
[244.06 --> 245.02]  I mean...
[245.02 --> 246.70]  It's news to do with that week.
[246.76 --> 247.64]  Don't get me wrong.
[247.70 --> 248.30]  Like it's cool.
[248.50 --> 249.84]  I love the dedication.
[250.06 --> 250.18]  Yes.
[250.18 --> 251.80]  Like major props.
[251.98 --> 252.54]  That's awesome.
[252.98 --> 253.98]  But why?
[255.98 --> 257.48]  The early ones...
[257.48 --> 259.30]  Like the really early ones...
[259.30 --> 259.80]  Maybe.
[260.12 --> 261.04]  For like nostalgia?
[261.68 --> 262.20]  No, no, no.
[262.34 --> 264.42]  But because we barely talked about news ever.
[264.54 --> 264.78]  Right.
[264.88 --> 266.32]  We had like one topic a week.
[266.70 --> 268.22]  Nostalgia news today.
[268.22 --> 269.22]  Yesterday.
[269.22 --> 269.42]  Yesterday.
[269.68 --> 272.50]  We talked about our like crazy sports game that we were playing.
[272.50 --> 273.20]  Yeah, that's true.
[273.26 --> 274.20]  We did talk about that.
[274.32 --> 277.20]  And like we would do like other random things.
[277.22 --> 282.38]  Then again, making the argument that the show is about news today is sort of like...
[282.38 --> 283.00]  Pretty rough.
[283.00 --> 290.72]  That's like standing on one stilt with like a balance beam on your head.
[291.02 --> 291.62]  And being like...
[291.62 --> 293.52]  And like potted plants on the beam.
[293.52 --> 294.20]  This is about soccer.
[294.32 --> 294.94]  On one side.
[295.02 --> 295.18]  Yeah.
[295.28 --> 296.06]  Like we actually...
[296.06 --> 298.00]  I mean we're at least 10 minutes into the show.
[298.18 --> 300.14]  We have not talked about any news yet.
[300.16 --> 301.48]  We introed four of them.
[301.96 --> 302.74]  That's true.
[302.98 --> 304.14]  We did do that.
[304.30 --> 307.32]  But sometimes we intro topics and then never talk about them.
[307.32 --> 308.54]  Never talk about them.
[308.88 --> 310.16]  There's also that problem.
[310.16 --> 312.08]  I don't even remember where I was going with this.
[312.22 --> 315.94]  So Activision Blizzard to acquire King Digital.
[316.66 --> 317.38]  And this...
[317.38 --> 319.42]  This is definitely the kicker here.
[319.60 --> 322.92]  For 5.9 billion.
[323.56 --> 324.38]  Yes, friends.
[324.60 --> 326.32]  5.9 billion.
[327.02 --> 328.20]  What is this ad?
[328.86 --> 331.86]  5.9 billion dollars.
[332.76 --> 333.42]  Do a neat thing.
[333.48 --> 335.30]  Whenever I yawn, I'm going to make it look like a roar.
[338.28 --> 339.20]  That's majestic.
[339.20 --> 340.52]  Thank you.
[342.38 --> 343.60]  Are you going to make the sound?
[344.34 --> 344.70]  No.
[347.36 --> 348.48]  Preferably not, I think.
[348.56 --> 349.68]  I would prefer that too.
[349.68 --> 349.80]  Okay.
[350.40 --> 350.80]  Alright.
[350.92 --> 352.90]  So they paid $18 per share.
[353.02 --> 355.06]  Which is a 20% premium over the trading price.
[355.18 --> 357.46]  Man, it is good for investors when companies get acquired.
[357.66 --> 359.66]  I don't understand how this works.
[359.80 --> 360.58]  I think you might.
[360.80 --> 363.56]  If you're acquiring a company, why don't you just buy all the shares?
[364.32 --> 365.40]  Why do you have to pay a premium?
[365.48 --> 366.90]  Because everyone ends up paying a premium.
[366.90 --> 368.88]  Because those people own it.
[369.74 --> 371.86]  So it's kind of like if you want to run...
[371.86 --> 373.86]  So basically they're like, actually, I don't want to sell this much.
[373.90 --> 375.68]  And then they're like, what about 20% more?
[375.76 --> 376.72]  And then they're like, oh, okay, sure.
[376.72 --> 382.34]  Yeah, well, those shareholders don't get to make the decision unless they're a majority
[382.34 --> 384.50]  or they can form a majority of the shareholders.
[384.80 --> 386.32]  Then they get to make the decision.
[386.58 --> 391.64]  But for the sake of the shareholders, including the majority holders, who definitely get paid
[391.64 --> 399.18]  more if they're paying more than market value, it's in their best interest to ask for more
[399.18 --> 401.46]  than just the day-to-day trading value.
[401.54 --> 403.52]  So if you're like, yeah, okay, if you don't just want to own a share of the company,
[403.56 --> 406.44]  you want to own the majority of the company, then you're going to pay extra.
[406.44 --> 410.62]  Now, the conventional wisdom, the consumer wisdom would be, well, hold on a second.
[410.62 --> 413.56]  If I'm bulk buying something, then I should get a discount.
[413.94 --> 414.16]  Yeah.
[414.36 --> 416.64]  But think of it more along the lines of...
[416.64 --> 418.26]  You gain control and that matters a lot.
[418.42 --> 420.22]  You're not just getting 400 popsicle sticks.
[420.28 --> 420.58]  Yes.
[420.94 --> 421.28]  You are...
[421.28 --> 423.60]  You now run the company that makes the 400 popsicle sticks.
[423.60 --> 423.86]  Yes.
[423.86 --> 429.54]  So think of it in terms of like if you want to run a highway through an area, typically
[429.54 --> 434.34]  the property owners, except in cases where the government of whatever country it happens
[434.34 --> 441.46]  to be is a gigantic tool, typically the correct way to do that is to offer the people in the
[441.46 --> 443.44]  way more than their land value.
[443.96 --> 445.72]  Some people don't want to move.
[446.00 --> 451.18]  And in those cases, they sometimes end up getting less because et cetera, et cetera, et
[451.18 --> 455.98]  cetera, because now they've got the one house that's like next to a super highway that curves
[455.98 --> 456.34]  around it.
[456.36 --> 458.26]  Like there's a lot of different ways it can go.
[458.66 --> 463.90]  But typically the sort of the best practice way is to offer people more than the assessed
[463.90 --> 467.72]  market value so that it's a quick and easy transaction and it's done and no one's raising
[467.72 --> 468.94]  a poop storm about it.
[469.70 --> 475.94]  So basically with the acquisition, they take two of the top five highest grossing mobile
[475.94 --> 478.12]  games in the US, which are...
[478.12 --> 481.50]  Candy Crush Saga and Candy Crush Soda Saga.
[481.76 --> 482.16]  Yes.
[482.82 --> 484.30]  That's two games apparently.
[486.04 --> 486.76]  That's like...
[486.76 --> 487.48]  Come on.
[487.58 --> 489.02]  Two of the best games.
[489.22 --> 492.60]  World of Warcraft and World of Warcraft Burning Crusade.
[496.82 --> 497.80]  Even then like...
[497.80 --> 498.46]  World of...
[498.46 --> 501.26]  Starcraft and Starcraft Brood War.
[501.50 --> 503.72]  But I don't even know if that's fair because I...
[503.72 --> 505.04]  This is probably...
[505.04 --> 505.52]  I don't know.
[505.56 --> 506.00]  I've never played.
[506.10 --> 507.08]  It's probably just a skin.
[507.08 --> 509.22]  It's probably not even like an expansion.
[509.24 --> 510.92]  No, it probably has different sound effects.
[511.22 --> 512.24]  Oh God.
[513.18 --> 515.30]  They're probably equally happy but different.
[515.74 --> 516.80]  Equally happy.
[517.66 --> 517.94]  Yeah.
[519.04 --> 519.60]  Probably.
[519.72 --> 525.34]  So basically, CEO of Activision Blizzard said the combined revenues and profits solidify
[525.34 --> 530.24]  our position as the largest, most profitable standalone company in interactive entertainment.
[530.24 --> 532.44]  I mean, I guess so.
[532.44 --> 539.06]  But you just bought a company for $5.9 billion that did...
[539.06 --> 540.06]  Hold on.
[540.06 --> 540.56]  What was it?
[540.56 --> 541.56]  Two point something.
[541.56 --> 542.40]  It's not in my notes.
[542.40 --> 543.40]  Why is this not in the notes?
[543.40 --> 544.10]  2.1.
[544.10 --> 544.60]  Is it?
[544.60 --> 545.48]  2.1 billion.
[545.48 --> 547.86]  2.1 billion in revenue.
[547.86 --> 552.96]  Now, with that said, it should be noted that for a microtransaction driven game like Candy Crush,
[552.96 --> 557.20]  2.1 billion revenue is basically as good as 2.1 billion profit.
[557.20 --> 564.24]  I mean, yes, they have to pay some dividends or whatever and I guess they probably have
[564.24 --> 567.84]  at least six programmers to develop a game like Candy Crush.
[568.52 --> 568.94]  Six?
[569.20 --> 569.64]  Ten?
[569.64 --> 571.78]  There's probably a fair amount behind it.
[571.82 --> 572.98]  I know.
[573.20 --> 575.82]  I mean, they have to process all those payments somehow.
[575.94 --> 576.22]  Yep.
[576.44 --> 578.40]  You know, you need an infrastructure for that.
[579.48 --> 580.52]  So, okay.
[580.52 --> 582.94]  But still, I mean...
[582.94 --> 585.78]  You have to make sure that people have to pay more in order to play your game.
[586.22 --> 591.62]  That's, you know, you got to put some effort in front of stopping people from having fun.
[591.66 --> 592.16]  Yeah, marketing.
[592.44 --> 593.84]  Marketing is key.
[594.18 --> 594.36]  Yeah, yeah.
[595.14 --> 596.18]  Tell me something.
[596.78 --> 602.02]  We've had a lot of mobile game companies offer us advertising dollars and every time I've said
[602.02 --> 603.82]  no because it's stupid.
[604.96 --> 606.00]  Did we ever do it?
[606.08 --> 607.58]  Maybe there was an exception, actually.
[607.88 --> 608.46]  I don't remember.
[608.56 --> 609.56]  I don't think so.
[609.56 --> 613.30]  But maybe there was one where they were like, they did something that was sort of somewhat
[613.30 --> 614.32]  different from what it...
[614.32 --> 619.58]  Anyway, if Activision Blizzard came to us and was like, we want to do an ad spot for Candy
[619.58 --> 620.50]  Crush, would you do it?
[623.26 --> 624.86]  I want to hear from Twitch chat.
[625.86 --> 626.54]  Should...
[626.54 --> 627.70]  Okay, hold on.
[627.82 --> 629.80]  We got to get a straw poll going here, kids.
[631.24 --> 634.20]  Should we take that Candy money?
[634.20 --> 637.54]  Because I know people that like Candy Crush.
[639.56 --> 641.12]  I just super don't.
[641.62 --> 642.86]  Does that mean it's wrong?
[642.98 --> 643.72]  I don't know.
[644.14 --> 645.32]  I mean, there was the whole...
[645.32 --> 645.94]  There was the whole...
[645.94 --> 653.52]  There is the whole argument that, you know, these games are predatory.
[654.18 --> 654.80]  Twitch chat.
[654.80 --> 657.48]  Why are you guys posting the answer?
[657.80 --> 659.08]  We don't look at that.
[659.08 --> 661.44]  Stop spamming so people can click the bitly.
[662.40 --> 665.64]  Because we're going to show the straw poll, not the Twitch chat.
[666.08 --> 667.60]  I love you guys, but come on.
[667.60 --> 675.18]  So there is the argument that microtransaction games are preying on the same people who are
[675.18 --> 679.80]  addicted to gambling or addicted to, well, really gambling.
[680.06 --> 681.74]  But people who have addictive personalities.
[683.88 --> 685.38]  With that said...
[685.38 --> 686.24]  I wouldn't want to.
[686.90 --> 687.22]  Yeah.
[687.36 --> 687.60]  Okay.
[687.70 --> 688.04]  Fair enough.
[688.10 --> 688.36]  Fair enough.
[688.36 --> 692.48]  So we've got 26% of you saying we should take that Candy money.
[692.94 --> 694.80]  We have 52% of you saying no.
[695.06 --> 698.24]  And 23% of you voting for turnip the way that you should.
[698.90 --> 704.62]  The thing is, I think we have enough really solid, respectable companies that we work with
[704.62 --> 707.64]  that I actually kind of enjoy doing ad spots for.
[707.66 --> 709.82]  Is Activision Blizzard not a respectable company?
[710.36 --> 712.38]  But I don't like that product.
[713.48 --> 713.82]  Okay.
[713.94 --> 716.02]  I'm just saying it's a respectable company, though.
[716.22 --> 716.46]  Yeah.
[717.04 --> 717.98]  You could make that argument.
[717.98 --> 718.34]  Yeah.
[718.88 --> 722.44]  Although they've done some dumb freaking crap.
[722.82 --> 723.26]  Yes.
[723.68 --> 725.12]  Like, oh my god.
[725.58 --> 727.60]  They basically killed StarCraft II.
[727.70 --> 728.90]  Yes, they did do that.
[729.82 --> 730.08]  Yeah.
[730.50 --> 730.82]  That's...
[730.82 --> 735.20]  Because, like, there's an argument to be said that they pulled the, like, okay, they
[735.20 --> 736.78]  didn't actively do anything to kill it.
[737.06 --> 738.92]  But they also just didn't actively do anything.
[738.92 --> 739.32]  Yeah.
[739.56 --> 744.28]  It was like their baby, and they were like, I'm going to leave it in a field with wolves
[744.28 --> 746.54]  and just see what happens, you know?
[746.54 --> 748.74]  Like, there's these Riot Games guys.
[748.90 --> 749.04]  What?
[749.24 --> 750.64]  They're cuddly.
[750.78 --> 751.28]  They're furry.
[751.32 --> 751.96]  Don't worry about that.
[751.96 --> 752.56]  They're cool guys.
[752.58 --> 753.76]  We'll just leave our baby in the field.
[753.82 --> 754.16]  It's okay.
[754.34 --> 757.60]  That's basically how esports was, like, two, three years ago.
[758.60 --> 758.84]  Yeah.
[758.84 --> 761.38]  So, yeah.
[762.00 --> 763.26]  I don't remember where else...
[763.26 --> 763.50]  Right.
[763.76 --> 765.06]  I remember where I was going with this.
[765.26 --> 767.26]  So, tell me something.
[768.14 --> 769.28]  It used to be Blizzard.
[769.70 --> 770.02]  Okay?
[770.36 --> 770.56]  Yeah.
[770.56 --> 775.64]  But now we've entered, you know, the modern era.
[776.12 --> 778.70]  You know, the 90s, the 2000s.
[779.72 --> 780.96]  Hyphenated names, man.
[781.04 --> 781.64]  That's a thing.
[781.90 --> 783.50]  So, now we've got Activision Blizzard.
[783.72 --> 784.54]  Active Blizzard King.
[784.78 --> 785.76]  So, no, no.
[785.76 --> 787.26]  Because no one does that.
[787.34 --> 788.02]  No one does that.
[788.10 --> 789.68]  My parents talked about that.
[789.76 --> 789.94]  Okay?
[789.98 --> 791.26]  My mom's last name, Sebastian.
[791.92 --> 792.90]  My dad's...
[792.90 --> 794.86]  My stepdad's last name is Neufeld.
[794.94 --> 796.36]  That's a very political topic.
[796.58 --> 798.18]  Everyone, please keep that to yourself.
[798.28 --> 798.46]  Okay?
[798.72 --> 800.94]  So, my stepdad's last name is Neufeld.
[801.12 --> 803.56]  And they're like, let's go by Sebfeld.
[803.74 --> 805.52]  And I'm like, that's stupid.
[806.30 --> 808.40]  Because Sebfeld is not a name.
[809.04 --> 810.84]  That's just a thing you invented.
[811.00 --> 815.56]  That's like, we could go by, like, J-X-Y-M-B.
[815.76 --> 816.78]  Like, my name is Sniff.
[816.78 --> 816.86]  You should.
[817.34 --> 817.64]  No.
[817.64 --> 818.02]  No.
[818.08 --> 819.56]  You guys should have gone by C-3PO.
[819.72 --> 820.44]  Actually stupid.
[820.56 --> 820.90]  Thank you.
[821.04 --> 821.94]  It should have just been your last name.
[821.94 --> 823.30]  You should have had numbers in your last name.
[823.88 --> 825.64]  So, anyway.
[826.20 --> 830.80]  So, my half siblings have hyphenated last names.
[831.04 --> 833.90]  And this really raises a legitimate concern.
[835.76 --> 836.20]  Sorry.
[836.36 --> 839.26]  Burkle is putting decorations on his wall.
[839.40 --> 839.74]  Burkle!
[840.22 --> 840.98]  No, it's okay.
[841.08 --> 841.30]  It's okay.
[841.40 --> 842.06]  I want him to show it.
[842.08 --> 842.28]  Sure.
[842.42 --> 842.60]  Okay.
[842.68 --> 843.46]  So, anyway.
[843.94 --> 845.38]  This raises a legitimate concern.
[845.38 --> 848.64]  What happens when hyphenated name people marry each other?
[848.64 --> 852.62]  So, is it Activision Blizzard King?
[852.76 --> 853.16]  Pictures.
[853.52 --> 857.08]  Or King Activision Blizzard?
[857.40 --> 858.24]  Like, what would we...
[858.24 --> 858.44]  Okay.
[858.72 --> 859.12]  Your call.
[859.20 --> 860.70]  Or Activision King Blizzard?
[861.70 --> 862.76]  King Activision Blizzard?
[862.98 --> 863.14]  Activision.
[863.14 --> 864.24]  King Blizzard Activision.
[864.34 --> 864.88]  Activision.
[864.98 --> 865.28]  Activision.
[865.28 --> 867.70]  How can you make it sound more like microtransactions?
[869.00 --> 869.52]  Yeah.
[869.60 --> 870.54]  Bring your stuff out.
[870.62 --> 871.16]  Show the audience.
[871.24 --> 872.04]  Blizzard Activision.
[872.04 --> 872.56]  Oh, that sounds like you saw me.
[872.68 --> 872.96]  Yeah.
[872.96 --> 873.04]  Yeah.
[873.78 --> 874.14]  Yeah.
[874.30 --> 877.00]  I cracked up when you were putting that stuff on the wall.
[877.04 --> 878.58]  I didn't know that's what you were referencing.
[878.62 --> 878.80]  Yeah.
[878.88 --> 879.02]  Here.
[879.22 --> 880.86]  Bring that stuff over here.
[880.96 --> 881.08]  Okay.
[881.14 --> 882.18]  You've got to explain how you did it.
[882.18 --> 882.36]  Okay.
[882.56 --> 882.94]  So, hold on.
[882.96 --> 883.14]  Hold on.
[883.16 --> 885.08]  Let me preface this really quickly.
[885.20 --> 889.98]  So, I gave all the editors, because we've got to do our editing den tour, like, for a number
[889.98 --> 890.44]  of reasons.
[890.54 --> 892.06]  Number one, you guys have been asking for it.
[892.10 --> 894.80]  Number two, the folks who contribute...
[894.80 --> 898.14]  LG, who gave us monitors for our editing den, and like...
[898.14 --> 898.88]  It looks so white right now.
[898.88 --> 906.34]  Um, Intel, Cooler Master, Logitech, uh, Razer, SteelSeries, like, Silverstone.
[906.42 --> 911.46]  Tons of guys threw a bunch of stuff at us to have, like, the ballinest editing den ever.
[911.92 --> 917.36]  And the only thing they asked for was that we make a video showing people our ballin' editing
[917.36 --> 919.92]  den, which we have not done.
[920.16 --> 924.94]  But the problem is that it looks kind of crap right now, because the walls are just bare.
[924.94 --> 928.80]  So, I gave all the editors, um, what was the budget?
[929.00 --> 929.52]  $150.
[929.78 --> 929.92]  Yeah.
[930.06 --> 932.48]  Which I don't think anyone stuck to.
[932.64 --> 933.32]  Yeah, I know.
[933.52 --> 934.28]  I did, I think.
[934.44 --> 939.74]  Each editor got a $150 budget to decorate their personal space to make it look cool.
[940.12 --> 942.98]  Some people went with sane, reasonable choices.
[943.54 --> 947.20]  This guy was fishing around for broken monitors for some reason.
[947.32 --> 948.24]  I thought nothing of it.
[948.76 --> 949.32]  What you got?
[949.32 --> 955.50]  I wanted another monitor, so I put two of my favorite people on the third monitor that's
[955.50 --> 956.86]  going to sit up and get up here and talk.
[957.04 --> 957.70]  And never change.
[958.32 --> 958.74]  Yeah, okay.
[959.14 --> 959.74]  I'll sit down.
[960.32 --> 961.76]  Look, you said LG sponsored it.
[962.06 --> 964.98]  A nice little LG screen for my desk.
[965.10 --> 966.10]  How beautiful is that?
[966.14 --> 967.40]  To go with the Samsung one.
[967.44 --> 968.22]  Yeah, the Samsung one.
[968.24 --> 969.20]  Also for your desk.
[969.26 --> 971.94]  And look at, can you see how much clearer the Samsung is in this?
[973.34 --> 975.10]  I don't know, it's really up to you folks.
[975.30 --> 977.38]  Look at that anti-glare screen on the Samsung.
[977.38 --> 980.34]  Yeah, so we got ourselves a Tim and Eric fan right here.
[980.48 --> 984.16]  So yeah, okay, you can go back to the work you're doing.
[984.30 --> 985.60]  I thought they were Synco monitors.
[986.02 --> 986.30]  Synco.
[986.34 --> 987.18]  No, that's a different one.
[987.32 --> 987.64]  Okay.
[988.68 --> 990.92]  I was walking in front of my camera when you called me out here.
[992.72 --> 994.68]  Okay, yeah, sorry, I just wanted to show you guys that.
[995.32 --> 996.94]  So yeah, how far are we into the show right now?
[997.06 --> 998.46]  I think we've done one tech topic.
[998.56 --> 999.56]  We're about 20 minutes in.
[999.74 --> 1000.70]  Yeah, this is a news show.
[1000.76 --> 1000.88]  Yeah.
[1002.10 --> 1003.02]  All right.
[1003.58 --> 1005.04]  Why do I look so pale today?
[1005.04 --> 1008.30]  On the subject of news, you look kind of pale today.
[1010.04 --> 1013.64]  I literally don't think I've been outside during the day because of the build blog.
[1014.12 --> 1015.68]  So that might actually be why.
[1015.80 --> 1017.92]  I don't think you can lose a tan in like three days.
[1019.42 --> 1021.50]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1021.50 --> 1022.74]  No, because it wasn't three days.
[1022.84 --> 1027.26]  This is a lifestyle, this is an ongoing lifestyle, lifestyle effect.
[1027.44 --> 1028.14]  Okay, that's fair.
[1028.14 --> 1033.72]  Microsoft, this is a great headline, kills the OneDrive party.
[1033.92 --> 1034.46]  Oh my God.
[1034.78 --> 1039.08]  Ends unlimited and downgrades storage options.
[1039.26 --> 1041.56]  They were not content.
[1041.82 --> 1042.94]  This was so brutal.
[1043.02 --> 1045.78]  They were not content to nerf this a little bit.
[1046.36 --> 1047.14]  They nerfed OneDrive.
[1048.14 --> 1051.80]  Can you think of an equivalent in gaming history?
[1052.04 --> 1053.96]  Can you think of a reason to use it now?
[1053.96 --> 1056.68]  I already still wasn't using it.
[1056.72 --> 1057.06]  I know.
[1057.20 --> 1059.20]  So like, why would anyone use it now?
[1060.02 --> 1061.14]  Equivalent in gaming history.
[1061.30 --> 1061.42]  Okay.
[1061.56 --> 1061.68]  Yeah.
[1061.86 --> 1062.82]  An equivalent nerf.
[1062.90 --> 1063.04]  Okay.
[1063.44 --> 1064.20]  Okay.
[1064.34 --> 1064.74]  Twitch chat.
[1064.82 --> 1065.32]  Twitch chat.
[1065.62 --> 1068.96]  Let's see if you guys can come up with something too because...
[1068.96 --> 1069.14]  Okay.
[1069.42 --> 1071.66]  Well, submit your ideas.
[1071.86 --> 1072.32]  How about you...
[1072.32 --> 1073.68]  Twisted Fate League of Legends.
[1075.26 --> 1075.62]  Okay.
[1075.72 --> 1076.00]  That's mine.
[1076.40 --> 1077.12]  That's your...
[1077.12 --> 1078.38]  The nerf that happened to Twisted Fate.
[1078.50 --> 1078.70]  Okay.
[1078.70 --> 1081.98]  Twisted Fate was like the best character and then he went to like completely unplayed.
[1081.98 --> 1085.72]  This was like way, way, way, way back at like the beginning.
[1086.56 --> 1088.92]  Or the pistol from Halo 1 to Halo 2.
[1089.68 --> 1091.44]  Oh, that's a good nerf.
[1091.68 --> 1098.58]  Because the pistol in Halo 1 is basically a sniper rifle, shotgun, assault rifle, and tactical nuke.
[1098.96 --> 1100.04]  All in one.
[1100.20 --> 1103.08]  And then the pistol in Halo 2 is like...
[1103.08 --> 1103.82]  Well, it's a pistol.
[1104.36 --> 1106.08]  And the enemies have energy shields.
[1106.28 --> 1106.58]  Yeah.
[1107.54 --> 1108.30]  Good luck.
[1108.30 --> 1110.90]  What do we got?
[1111.00 --> 1111.30]  We got...
[1111.30 --> 1111.70]  Okay.
[1111.86 --> 1112.62]  Oh my goodness.
[1112.70 --> 1113.90]  It's going so fast.
[1114.02 --> 1115.90]  Well, so many people are bringing up stuff from like...
[1115.90 --> 1117.56]  CSGO M4A1?
[1118.46 --> 1119.72]  Was a nerf that bad?
[1119.88 --> 1120.80]  I don't think it was.
[1121.70 --> 1122.24]  I mean, okay.
[1122.34 --> 1124.26]  Why don't we give people some...
[1124.26 --> 1126.28]  Why don't we give people some context here?
[1127.40 --> 1130.32]  Let's give some context for what Microsoft did to OneDrive.
[1130.32 --> 1132.62]  So they had a free option.
[1132.84 --> 1134.98]  Storage capacity was 15 gigs.
[1135.40 --> 1138.34]  They have nuked that down to five.
[1138.66 --> 1140.50]  They have cut it in one third.
[1140.92 --> 1141.26]  Okay?
[1141.70 --> 1144.38]  For all users, current and new.
[1144.50 --> 1148.60]  To be fair, these effects, if you are a current user, happen 12 months from now.
[1149.06 --> 1150.06]  So you're good for a year.
[1150.16 --> 1150.32]  But still...
[1151.16 --> 1153.18]  So you're good for a year and then your junk disappears.
[1153.38 --> 1153.54]  Yeah.
[1153.54 --> 1155.54]  Which from my...
[1156.10 --> 1157.30]  I don't want my junk to disappear.
[1157.62 --> 1158.10]  Me neither.
[1158.28 --> 1159.54]  Unless it's disappearing in...
[1160.08 --> 1160.38]  Sorry.
[1161.06 --> 1161.84]  In mustard.
[1162.06 --> 1162.56]  In mustard.
[1162.68 --> 1163.06]  Thank you.
[1164.58 --> 1165.40]  So to be...
[1165.40 --> 1170.14]  I mean, this flies in the face of everything that cloud storage is supposed to be.
[1170.42 --> 1173.68]  I mean, when Google offered Gmail and they were like,
[1173.90 --> 1175.58]  G, because we're Gs.
[1175.80 --> 1176.16]  Wait, no.
[1176.22 --> 1177.30]  I think it had something to do with...
[1177.30 --> 1177.66]  Google.
[1177.84 --> 1178.10]  Gigabyte.
[1179.58 --> 1179.98]  Really?
[1180.58 --> 1180.88]  Yeah.
[1181.38 --> 1182.38]  No, it was Gigabyte.
[1182.38 --> 1184.58]  It offered a Gigabyte of...
[1184.58 --> 1188.82]  I hate you.
[1190.56 --> 1195.54]  It offered a Gigabyte of storage at a time when Hotmail offered like 25 Megs or something
[1195.54 --> 1196.38]  laughable like that.
[1196.40 --> 1196.58]  Yeah.
[1197.18 --> 1199.50]  So that was where the Exodus came from.
[1199.60 --> 1200.28]  So my understanding...
[1200.28 --> 1201.76]  Remember the counter...
[1201.76 --> 1202.92]  I don't want to talk to you anymore.
[1202.92 --> 1205.24]  Like how much more drive space they were adding all the time?
[1205.36 --> 1205.52]  Yeah.
[1205.52 --> 1206.20]  Do they still have that?
[1206.28 --> 1206.66]  I don't know.
[1206.66 --> 1208.02]  That was actually super cool.
[1208.04 --> 1208.68]  Because that was sick.
[1208.80 --> 1209.02]  Yeah.
[1209.02 --> 1210.82]  But that is the point.
[1210.82 --> 1217.04]  That is the point of like cloud storage is like it's always expanding, always getting
[1217.04 --> 1222.28]  cheaper, and it's always a safe place to keep your data where companies don't just turn
[1222.28 --> 1227.58]  off your space if you like don't check your email for a year and don't get the notification
[1227.58 --> 1228.08]  or whatever.
[1228.64 --> 1231.48]  Like I thought it was supposed to be like pretty safe.
[1231.48 --> 1231.98]  So...
[1231.98 --> 1235.70]  Which like actually if I wasn't doing this show, I probably wouldn't have heard about
[1235.70 --> 1239.44]  this because I basically never check my Outlook account.
[1239.58 --> 1239.78]  Nope.
[1239.90 --> 1240.72]  I wouldn't have heard about it.
[1240.82 --> 1242.22]  It is attached to things though.
[1242.66 --> 1245.56]  And if I did use OneDrive for like a few things, they would be gone.
[1245.64 --> 1251.40]  Now, Microsoft says the changes are arriving due to Microsoft discovering that some users
[1251.40 --> 1253.94]  were abusing the online storage service.
[1253.94 --> 1256.94]  However, this pissed me off.
[1257.00 --> 1257.96]  So I'm just going to wait for you here.
[1258.16 --> 1265.66]  That has nothing to do with your free account holders who were allocated 15 gigs who presumably
[1265.66 --> 1274.06]  someone at Microsoft can figure out the conversion from gigabytes to terabytes to megabytes and
[1274.06 --> 1280.38]  how much hard drives cost and maybe like, I don't know, run some basic freaking rudimentary
[1280.38 --> 1286.16]  numbers and find out, you know, how much each gigabyte of storage costs in a cloud server
[1286.16 --> 1290.62]  somewhere because this is like pretty well established shit at this point.
[1291.00 --> 1291.74]  Pardon my French.
[1292.26 --> 1294.12]  Um, okay.
[1294.30 --> 1299.54]  They say in some extreme cases, users were storing in excess of 75 terabytes of data on a
[1299.54 --> 1301.44]  single Office 365 account.
[1301.44 --> 1304.20]  The reason for that is because they got unlimited storage.
[1304.46 --> 1308.92]  So it was because a few people using something that they were literally allowed to use and
[1308.92 --> 1311.72]  paid for in the fine print that they were paying for.
[1311.76 --> 1312.48]  Paying customers.
[1312.68 --> 1315.44]  Uh, it's apparently hurt all the free guys as well.
[1316.12 --> 1320.20]  You give someone unlimited access to something and then you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1320.44 --> 1322.12]  We didn't mean that unlimited.
[1322.52 --> 1323.30]  That's bullshit.
[1323.48 --> 1323.68]  I'm sorry.
[1323.82 --> 1330.62]  And the correct, the correct response to the extreme users who frankly were being very unreasonable.
[1330.62 --> 1331.62]  Who cares?
[1331.78 --> 1332.14]  It's unlimited.
[1332.14 --> 1332.38]  They were.
[1332.54 --> 1332.98]  They were.
[1333.86 --> 1340.78]  What they should have done was adjusted the paid customers to a terabyte or something or
[1340.78 --> 1342.58]  two terabytes or something.
[1342.78 --> 1346.68]  Or made them get like a business tier unlimited account, which was way more expensive or something.
[1346.76 --> 1347.92]  Or something.
[1347.92 --> 1350.70]  And, and just targeted the unreasonable users.
[1350.70 --> 1352.04]  Cause I get it.
[1352.24 --> 1356.44]  75 terabytes of space for like, what does Office 365 cost?
[1356.54 --> 1358.08]  Like a hundred dollars a year or something like that?
[1358.10 --> 1358.56]  A lot of time.
[1358.66 --> 1360.02]  Like I can't, I can't remember.
[1360.14 --> 1361.02]  I have a subscription.
[1361.16 --> 1361.72]  I should know this.
[1361.78 --> 1362.62]  They screwed up though.
[1362.62 --> 1363.96]  They shouldn't have said it was unlimited.
[1363.96 --> 1369.66]  So, and if they're going to backpedal, backpedal in a way that's reasonable and makes sense.
[1370.50 --> 1374.88]  So anyway, they are no longer offering unlimited storage.
[1375.00 --> 1376.12]  I think that pretty much goes without saying.
[1376.34 --> 1380.58]  They are cutting it back to one terabyte of OneDrive storage with your subscription.
[1380.58 --> 1394.40]  So, the 100 gig and 200 gig OneDrive paid plans are going away as an option for new users and will be replaced with a 50 gig plan for $199 per month in early 2016.
[1395.32 --> 1401.28]  The 15 gig, excuse me, camera roll storage bonus will also be discontinued in early 2016.
[1402.42 --> 1410.28]  And Office 365 subscribers with an excess of one terabyte will be notified of the change and will be able to keep their increased storage for at least 12 months.
[1410.58 --> 1415.88]  So, basically, they did it in the most dickish possible way.
[1416.38 --> 1417.72]  Super not impressed.
[1418.56 --> 1423.24]  I don't personally use OneDrive because I don't care.
[1424.80 --> 1426.08]  Because it sucks.
[1426.94 --> 1428.78]  The interface really isn't very good.
[1429.04 --> 1430.64]  It's just, it's really just not.
[1431.70 --> 1434.96]  Yeah, I'm super just don't like it.
[1436.08 --> 1439.46]  They tried to make it like clean and modern and honestly, I think they just messed it up.
[1439.72 --> 1440.16]  Yeah.
[1440.58 --> 1443.10]  Like anything, the way to make something clean.
[1443.20 --> 1444.20]  Here's a pro tip.
[1444.82 --> 1445.10]  Okay.
[1445.30 --> 1446.76]  Here's how to make something clean.
[1447.44 --> 1452.44]  It should integrate seamlessly into the existing UI of whatever device I'm using it on.
[1453.50 --> 1454.22]  It's a pro tip.
[1454.52 --> 1454.68]  Okay.
[1454.84 --> 1457.16]  That's why Dropbox does so well.
[1457.78 --> 1459.56]  It's just a folder on your computer.
[1459.98 --> 1463.08]  You literally like right click, paste.
[1463.08 --> 1468.66]  Or like right click, create public link, share with someone.
[1469.04 --> 1469.80]  It's very simple.
[1471.60 --> 1472.92]  My mother still can't do it.
[1473.14 --> 1474.96]  But it's a whole other issue.
[1474.96 --> 1475.96]  Okay.
[1475.96 --> 1476.22]  Um.
[1477.74 --> 1478.90]  YouTube blooms.
[1479.98 --> 1481.28]  This is so weird.
[1482.12 --> 1483.32]  It's weird, but.
[1483.74 --> 1485.70]  Like it's, it's kind of cool.
[1485.98 --> 1487.40]  It's, I think it's pretty cool.
[1487.48 --> 1487.76]  Yeah.
[1488.10 --> 1489.78]  It's just like, I'm, I'm just.
[1490.12 --> 1491.36]  When I saw this, I was like, wait.
[1491.58 --> 1492.58]  Is this URL right?
[1492.76 --> 1493.90]  Like are we all getting trolled?
[1493.90 --> 1494.06]  Yeah.
[1494.06 --> 1495.54]  Are we on youtube.com?
[1495.58 --> 1495.82]  Yeah.
[1495.92 --> 1496.12]  Yeah.
[1496.18 --> 1496.34]  Yeah.
[1496.34 --> 1496.52]  Yeah.
[1496.52 --> 1496.54]  Yeah.
[1496.54 --> 1497.50]  I checked that like.
[1497.90 --> 1498.30]  I did.
[1498.42 --> 1500.12]  I was pretty worried about that actually.
[1500.16 --> 1502.38]  I was like, HTTPS.
[1502.58 --> 1502.86]  Yeah.
[1503.10 --> 1503.36]  Yeah.
[1503.48 --> 1504.60]  YouTube.com.
[1504.74 --> 1507.16]  There's no like, it's not like dot corn.
[1507.62 --> 1507.88]  Yeah.
[1507.88 --> 1508.36]  Yeah.
[1508.60 --> 1509.12]  There's something.
[1509.64 --> 1510.68]  SSL checks out.
[1510.76 --> 1511.86]  It's verified by Google Inc.
[1511.86 --> 1512.08]  Yeah.
[1512.50 --> 1512.94]  Okay.
[1513.20 --> 1513.76]  I was like, okay.
[1514.18 --> 1520.04]  So basically the way it works is YouTube has partnered with Lending Club to provide YouTube
[1520.04 --> 1523.38]  creators with a limited finance option to put towards building their channels.
[1523.38 --> 1523.86]  Yeah.
[1523.90 --> 1532.00]  Um, it's really not that different from any other business or personal loan, except that
[1532.00 --> 1534.82]  YouTube is apparently facilitating it for one thing.
[1535.28 --> 1538.12]  Um, the terms of the loan.
[1538.46 --> 1539.56]  There's some interesting stuff.
[1539.66 --> 1540.30]  Pretty good.
[1540.88 --> 1546.12]  And it's, I believe it's at like something like a 5.9% interest rate.
[1546.12 --> 1554.22]  And if you successfully increase your channels, average upload frequency or watch time over
[1554.22 --> 1559.96]  a period of 12 months after you take out the loan, you get a 5% rebate on the original total
[1559.96 --> 1560.46]  loan amount.
[1560.46 --> 1561.56]  So what does that end up?
[1561.56 --> 1562.56]  Pretty cool.
[1562.56 --> 1568.56]  So basically it's, it's a, and I am not to be clear.
[1568.56 --> 1576.10]  I am not an interest calculator whiz kid guru who can, who can figure that crap out in my head.
[1576.10 --> 1584.20]  Uh, so, so don't take my word for this 100%, but it looks like if you pay it back in a year, it'll be effectively
[1584.20 --> 1587.62]  like a 1 point something percent ish loan.
[1587.62 --> 1589.38]  Pretty cool.
[1589.38 --> 1592.30]  If you need a chunk of money to develop your YouTube channel and you really think you can
[1592.30 --> 1593.30]  take it to the next level.
[1593.30 --> 1598.30]  So one of the challenges that we had at Linus Media Group, it's really, it's really funny.
[1598.30 --> 1604.30]  Um, a lot of people complained about our tip starter campaign where we asked our community to help us fund this new office.
[1604.30 --> 1606.30]  People were like, take out a loan.
[1606.30 --> 1607.30]  Yeah, we did.
[1607.30 --> 1608.30]  We're not idiots.
[1608.30 --> 1614.30]  We also voluntarily asked our community to help us because that helps a lot too.
[1614.30 --> 1622.30]  And we said it was optional and you get literally nothing in exchange for it other than a cool badge on the forum.
[1622.30 --> 1624.30]  And we had to do some pretty stupid shit.
[1624.30 --> 1626.30]  Yeah, we did do some dumb stuff.
[1626.30 --> 1633.30]  And like some people I did like personalized thank yous for at certain tiers and like, but you don't, you don't get like a t-shirt for it or anything because the other people are like,
[1633.30 --> 1638.30]  I don't get like a t-shirt for it or anything because the idea was we were using it to make our new office and our new workflow better and all that stuff.
[1638.30 --> 1639.30]  And we did.
[1639.30 --> 1644.30]  Um, but getting a loan is not that simple.
[1644.30 --> 1645.30]  Okay.
[1645.30 --> 1654.30]  Especially if you're like a small time creator, like still living at home with your parents and you don't have a mortgage to, to, to use as a, as collateral or not a mortgage.
[1654.30 --> 1656.30]  You don't use a mortgage as collateral.
[1656.30 --> 1659.30]  You use the house, the value in the house as the collateral.
[1659.30 --> 1660.30]  Like if you don't have collateral.
[1660.30 --> 1661.30]  Um, and this is interesting.
[1661.30 --> 1663.30]  So there's two tiers that they're offering.
[1663.30 --> 1667.30]  You can get up to a $35,000 personal loan.
[1667.30 --> 1670.30]  If you receive an official invitation from YouTube, that's a key.
[1670.30 --> 1677.30]  You've been operating your business for less than two years and you have less than $75,000 of annual revenue through your YouTube channel.
[1677.30 --> 1687.30]  Um, and then the second tier to get up to $300,000 of business loan, you have to be operating for at least two years as a business.
[1687.30 --> 1691.30]  And you have to have over $75,000 in annual revenue.
[1691.30 --> 1701.30]  And that is one of the challenges because since the economic downturn of 2008 lending criteria, at least in some places has gotten a lot more strict.
[1701.30 --> 1705.30]  And it's not that easy to just, Hey, I'm a business.
[1705.30 --> 1706.30]  I've got a business idea.
[1706.30 --> 1708.30]  You should give me some money.
[1708.30 --> 1710.30]  Oh, I guess that didn't work.
[1710.30 --> 1712.30]  Well, I'm falling for bankruptcy.
[1712.30 --> 1713.30]  Yeah.
[1713.30 --> 1718.30]  That happened enough times that the lenders kind of went, yeah, no.
[1718.30 --> 1729.30]  So I was not able to get a loan for the things that we needed to do here until Linus Media Group had been operating for two years.
[1729.30 --> 1735.30]  Fortunately, that timing worked out pretty much perfectly with when we got kicked out of our old place.
[1735.30 --> 1737.30]  Um, and we were able to move it here.
[1737.30 --> 1738.30]  Literally.
[1738.30 --> 1741.30]  Sort of perfectly because another month would have been great.
[1741.30 --> 1742.30]  Super awesome.
[1742.30 --> 1743.30]  Super awesome.
[1743.30 --> 1744.30]  Oh, yeah.
[1744.30 --> 1751.30]  It's nice though, because I've seen some comments on the videos lately that are like, yeah, I'm, you know, I'm not hating on these guys.
[1751.30 --> 1755.30]  But like some of that content during the move was kind of rough.
[1755.30 --> 1756.30]  Yeah.
[1756.30 --> 1757.30]  It's like, we know.
[1757.30 --> 1760.30]  We really had a lot of other stuff to do.
[1760.30 --> 1761.30]  Like move.
[1761.30 --> 1767.30]  And moving is not as simple as just pick up the thing, move it to the other place and put it down.
[1767.30 --> 1769.30]  It's really not.
[1769.30 --> 1772.30]  Um, anyway, I think this is really cool.
[1772.30 --> 1781.30]  And if you're a YouTube creator that's kind of struggling, but you feel like, wow, $35,000 in, or even, remember, up to 35.
[1781.30 --> 1784.30]  So like, wow, I could really use a $10,000 loan.
[1784.30 --> 1795.30]  And if Google's willing to kind of vouch for me that I'm cool and I know what I'm doing, um, I could invest in like that capture equipment or that camera gear or whatever else that I need to really get this thing off the ground.
[1795.30 --> 1802.30]  Because honestly, I get, I probably get a request a day from someone who wants to start a game streaming channel.
[1802.30 --> 1808.30]  And they're like, yeah, all I need to get it off the ground and like do better is like, like this BA computer and stuff.
[1808.30 --> 1817.30]  And I'm just like, I'm sorry, I actually cannot send a computer to every person who tells me that they have a game streaming channel and they want to do better.
[1817.30 --> 1819.30]  It's not actually possible.
[1819.30 --> 1820.30]  It does not grow on trees.
[1820.30 --> 1823.30]  A lot of people think these guys have like tons of hardware.
[1823.30 --> 1824.30]  It's falling out of their ears.
[1824.30 --> 1828.30]  And from a certain perspective, that is kind of true.
[1828.30 --> 1833.30]  But for most of the things we only have like, like one of everything.
[1833.30 --> 1837.30]  So when we're like, we have more camera equipment now than we have computers.
[1837.30 --> 1838.30]  Yeah, I'd say that's true.
[1838.30 --> 1839.30]  Like for sure.
[1839.30 --> 1840.30]  Yeah.
[1840.30 --> 1845.30]  And like the sweet build log that I'm doing right now, I'm just gonna have to take apart like immediately.
[1845.30 --> 1847.30]  Cause we're gonna need the things from it.
[1847.30 --> 1850.30]  A lot of people are like Linus's three year old has a way better computer than it.
[1850.30 --> 1851.30]  No, he doesn't.
[1851.30 --> 1852.30]  That got taken apart.
[1852.30 --> 1853.30]  Like how long?
[1853.30 --> 1854.30]  Literally one day later.
[1854.30 --> 1855.30]  Yeah.
[1855.30 --> 1856.30]  He's three.
[1856.30 --> 1858.30]  We need a frigging desktop computer for it.
[1858.30 --> 1859.30]  He's three.
[1859.30 --> 1860.30]  We build things.
[1860.30 --> 1861.30]  We take them apart.
[1861.30 --> 1862.30]  It's like weight lifters.
[1862.30 --> 1863.30]  They pick things up and they put them back down.
[1863.30 --> 1865.30]  We build computers and we take them back apart.
[1865.30 --> 1871.30]  We don't, we don't have 20, you know, 67, 6,700 K processors.
[1871.30 --> 1872.30]  I think we have one.
[1872.30 --> 1873.30]  We have one.
[1873.30 --> 1874.30]  Yeah.
[1874.30 --> 1875.30]  And that was like pulling teeth to get.
[1875.30 --> 1878.30]  It's not like, it's not like free hardware rains from the heavens or whatever.
[1878.30 --> 1885.30]  So, so this looks like a more realistic option for, for a startup creator to, you know,
[1885.30 --> 1889.30]  if they've got some talent and that's the thing is people are always asking me to like,
[1889.30 --> 1891.30]  how do you get sponsored with hardware?
[1891.30 --> 1894.30]  It's like, people on Twitch chat are like, what?
[1894.30 --> 1895.30]  Illusion shattered.
[1895.30 --> 1896.30]  Oh my God.
[1896.30 --> 1897.30]  Uh, yeah.
[1897.30 --> 1900.30]  It's like, how do you get sponsored with hardware?
[1900.30 --> 1901.30]  Have an audience.
[1901.30 --> 1904.30]  Well, I can't have an audience if I'm not sponsored with hardware.
[1904.30 --> 1905.30]  Get creative.
[1905.30 --> 1908.30]  I can't, that's how literally everyone did it.
[1908.30 --> 1910.30]  I was literally everyone.
[1910.30 --> 1911.30]  Some people know this.
[1911.30 --> 1916.30]  I was starting a channel that no one knew about at all before I joined you.
[1916.30 --> 1922.30]  Um, and my plan was a lot of my friends at the time were getting into building computers.
[1922.30 --> 1925.30]  So, build their computer for them.
[1925.30 --> 1926.30]  Do it at your house.
[1926.30 --> 1931.30]  Film a video about every part, review every part in the computer.
[1931.30 --> 1933.30]  Also film building the computer.
[1933.30 --> 1934.30]  Do some benchmarks with it.
[1934.30 --> 1935.30]  Film that.
[1935.30 --> 1937.30]  Just utilize everything that you can.
[1937.30 --> 1939.30]  Oh, your buddy just got a new phone.
[1939.30 --> 1941.30]  Borrow it for a day.
[1941.30 --> 1942.30]  Give him 20 bucks or something.
[1942.30 --> 1944.30]  Buy him food or whatever.
[1944.30 --> 1945.30]  Borrow for a day.
[1945.30 --> 1946.30]  Review the phone.
[1946.30 --> 1947.30]  Do whatever you need to do.
[1947.30 --> 1949.30]  Get smart about buying and selling used stuff.
[1949.30 --> 1950.30]  Yup, yup definitely.
[1950.30 --> 1956.30]  You can acquire things temporarily and then you can get rid of them very quickly and not
[1956.30 --> 1958.30]  lose a whole lot of money on the transaction.
[1958.30 --> 1963.30]  Buy a cheap version of a popular phone on Craigslist.
[1963.30 --> 1967.30]  Um, resell it on Craigslist for hopefully more than buy a different one.
[1967.30 --> 1968.30]  Review that.
[1968.30 --> 1969.30]  Flip it again.
[1969.30 --> 1976.30]  Start building up that, that, that kind of that slush fund of acquiring things and cycling
[1976.30 --> 1977.30]  through them.
[1977.30 --> 1980.30]  People are saying I had NCIX hardware to start to build an audience.
[1980.30 --> 1981.30]  Yes, I did.
[1981.30 --> 1984.30]  That's yet another example of get creative.
[1984.30 --> 1985.30]  Find a solution.
[1985.30 --> 1988.30]  My solution was I worked with a local retailer.
[1988.30 --> 1991.30]  And people are like, oh yeah, I, I emailed my local retailer and they said they're not
[1991.30 --> 1992.30]  interested.
[1992.30 --> 1993.30]  Well, of course they're not interested.
[1993.30 --> 1994.30]  You sent an email.
[1994.30 --> 1996.30]  Who cares what you think?
[1996.30 --> 1997.30]  You sent an email.
[1997.30 --> 1998.30]  You didn't even show up.
[1998.30 --> 2001.30]  You got to show up if you want to play the game.
[2001.30 --> 2002.30]  Kids.
[2002.30 --> 2004.30]  Right?
[2004.30 --> 2008.30]  There's other also like shadier ways to do it that I'm not going to go over.
[2008.30 --> 2009.30]  Well, yeah.
[2009.30 --> 2010.30]  But there's like...
[2010.30 --> 2011.30]  Ah, whatever.
[2011.30 --> 2012.30]  Let's just say it.
[2012.30 --> 2015.30]  I mean, a lot of people starting up buy things from places with great return policies and
[2015.30 --> 2016.30]  return them.
[2016.30 --> 2020.30]  That's legitimately what I'm planning to do with the Surface book.
[2020.30 --> 2021.30]  I got a 30 day return policy.
[2021.30 --> 2022.30]  That's not my problem.
[2022.30 --> 2023.30]  Yeah.
[2023.30 --> 2025.30]  And it's like, I don't know what you want from me.
[2025.30 --> 2026.30]  Yeah.
[2026.30 --> 2027.30]  It happens.
[2027.30 --> 2028.30]  It honestly happens a lot.
[2028.30 --> 2031.30]  Like it's, it's, it's about get it done.
[2031.30 --> 2035.30]  That is what any job, especially if you're self employed is about.
[2035.30 --> 2036.30]  Get it done.
[2036.30 --> 2038.30]  Basically always a way to work harder.
[2038.30 --> 2039.30]  Um, anyway.
[2039.30 --> 2040.30]  Yeah, very cool.
[2040.30 --> 2041.30]  I didn't really read any of the notes.
[2041.30 --> 2042.30]  You got to be able to do it.
[2042.30 --> 2043.30]  I'm going to be able to do it.
[2043.30 --> 2044.30]  I'm going to be able to do it.
[2044.30 --> 2045.30]  I'm going to be able to do it.
[2045.30 --> 2046.30]  I'm going to be able to do it.
[2046.30 --> 2047.30]  I'm going to be able to do it.
[2047.30 --> 2048.30]  I'm going to be able to do it.
[2048.30 --> 2050.30]  Um, I didn't really read any of the notes.
[2050.30 --> 2051.30]  You got to be 18 or older to qualify.
[2051.30 --> 2053.30]  Um, it's not, there's not really that much to say.
[2053.30 --> 2054.30]  It's, it's a loaning thing.
[2054.30 --> 2058.30]  The, the loan income lending club or whatever already existed.
[2058.30 --> 2060.30]  There's just a couple special terms for YouTube.
[2060.30 --> 2061.30]  That's it.
[2061.30 --> 2064.30]  And the 5% rebate just for, I mean, that's bad.
[2064.30 --> 2068.30]  If all you have to do is upload more content in the year, then if you don't get that 5% rebate,
[2068.30 --> 2069.30]  then go home.
[2069.30 --> 2072.30]  You, you're not cut out for the YouTube game.
[2072.30 --> 2075.30]  Unfortunately, we couldn't even do that with Linus Ectives.
[2075.30 --> 2076.30]  Yeah.
[2076.30 --> 2079.30]  It's like more videos than Linus Ectives would just be insane.
[2079.30 --> 2081.30]  That's okay though, because we don't need the loan.
[2081.30 --> 2082.30]  Don't want it.
[2082.30 --> 2083.30]  Yeah.
[2083.30 --> 2084.30]  Yeah.
[2084.30 --> 2085.30]  We're good.
[2085.30 --> 2086.30]  Yep.
[2086.30 --> 2087.30]  We're good.
[2087.30 --> 2090.30]  Thanks to our fantastic community, our great sponsors like lynda.com.
[2090.30 --> 2091.30]  Yeah.
[2091.30 --> 2095.30]  Learn things about making videos.
[2095.30 --> 2096.30]  Maybe say for example.
[2096.30 --> 2097.30]  Yeah.
[2097.30 --> 2098.30]  I mean, that is the, wow.
[2098.30 --> 2104.30]  That would be a really good way to, even if you took out a very small YouTube loan.
[2104.30 --> 2105.30]  If you're like, yeah.
[2105.30 --> 2106.30]  Buy a linda account.
[2106.30 --> 2108.30]  I just need like 5,000 bucks.
[2108.30 --> 2109.30]  Okay.
[2109.30 --> 2113.30]  I need like, I need like a couple generation old camera to get me going.
[2113.30 --> 2119.30]  I need like a crappy tripod, a used slider, a lens and a lynda.com subscription.
[2119.30 --> 2120.30]  Here I go.
[2120.30 --> 2122.30]  I'm like taking my game to the next level.
[2122.30 --> 2126.30]  It is amazing how far you can stretch a small budget.
[2126.30 --> 2127.30]  Anyway, sorry.
[2127.30 --> 2128.30]  Sorry.
[2128.30 --> 2132.30]  I'm going to have a lot of, of lynda.com, which for some reason I'm like blanking on
[2132.30 --> 2133.30]  my, my talking points.
[2133.30 --> 2134.30]  I've done this many times.
[2134.30 --> 2135.30]  You can learn a whole bunch of stuff.
[2135.30 --> 2137.30]  They have production trainings.
[2137.30 --> 2141.30]  You can learn things about premiere, which is probably kind of helpful.
[2141.30 --> 2145.30]  Business, photography, productivity, applications.
[2145.30 --> 2147.30]  Business is pretty huge on there.
[2147.30 --> 2148.30]  Yeah.
[2148.30 --> 2151.30]  They got more than 3,000 courses available from top experts.
[2151.30 --> 2155.30]  You can get a 10 day free trial at lynda.com slash WAN show.
[2155.30 --> 2158.30]  One thing that I very much like on there is that you can download things.
[2158.30 --> 2159.30]  Yes.
[2159.30 --> 2161.30]  You can download and watch on your mobile device on the go.
[2161.30 --> 2163.30]  So you don't have to be streaming it.
[2163.30 --> 2164.30]  You can make notes, you can make playlists.
[2164.30 --> 2167.30]  So you and your friends can learn along with each other.
[2167.30 --> 2171.30]  Like I talk, I think I've talked about this before, but I'm just going to do it again.
[2171.30 --> 2177.30]  Like my son's already reading and he's like three, three and a half or something like that.
[2177.30 --> 2180.30]  So that kid's going to hit like kindergarten grade one.
[2180.30 --> 2182.30]  He's going to be straight up bored.
[2182.30 --> 2192.30]  So my plan because I am a complete programming know nothing is I'm going to like seriously start at his level and start learning some of that stuff with him.
[2192.30 --> 2193.30]  That's awesome.
[2193.30 --> 2201.30]  And a tool like lynda.com is going to be awesome because like I already recognize that even though I'm fairly techie, a lot of people don't understand this.
[2201.30 --> 2215.30]  But the cold hard truth is once you have a job and you have kids and you have say for example anything else in your life, you know, I'll get a lot of flack like, oh, why doesn't Lynda know how to use Snapchat or whatever?
[2215.30 --> 2221.30]  Because quite frankly, I don't have to and I don't care and I've got other stuff going on because I don't have time to sit.
[2221.30 --> 2231.30]  If it's not like if it's not my job to do it and it's not taking care of my babies and it's not like any of these other legitimately very important things, I don't know.
[2231.30 --> 2234.30]  And that is how old people get out of touch.
[2234.30 --> 2244.30]  And I recognize that not being up on at least the fundamentals of programming is going to be a huge difference between me and the generation that's following me.
[2244.30 --> 2247.30]  So if I want to keep up, I have one shot at this.
[2247.30 --> 2255.30]  As he's getting older, this is my one chance for him to not be speaking a language, literally a language that I completely don't understand.
[2255.30 --> 2257.30]  When are you guys starting that?
[2257.30 --> 2259.30]  Probably when he's around five.
[2259.30 --> 2260.30]  Cool.
[2260.30 --> 2264.30]  Yeah, that's kind of my plan. So I need to get him into badminton.
[2264.30 --> 2267.30]  If you ever need like help or whatever, super interested, that'd be cool.
[2267.30 --> 2268.30]  Thank you.
[2268.30 --> 2269.30]  Yeah.
[2269.30 --> 2271.30]  That's like an off the show thing.
[2271.30 --> 2272.30]  Yeah, whatever.
[2272.30 --> 2279.30]  Yeah, I'm thinking around the time he hits five. I want him in martial arts. I want him doing like some kind of competitive sport.
[2279.30 --> 2282.30]  Not that I'm saying martial arts isn't competitive, I know.
[2282.30 --> 2284.30]  A team sport?
[2284.30 --> 2287.30]  Maybe team, maybe, maybe not. I don't know.
[2287.30 --> 2291.30]  I want him swimming. Swimming is like necessary.
[2291.30 --> 2297.30]  And then my wife wants him doing a musical instrument. He's half Asian, so I'm assuming he'll play the piano.
[2297.30 --> 2298.30]  Piano is really good though.
[2298.30 --> 2300.30]  I know. I'm not dissing the piano.
[2300.30 --> 2301.30]  It makes sense.
[2301.30 --> 2304.30]  I'm just saying like, I'm not trying to stereotype.
[2304.30 --> 2308.30]  I'm just saying that it's a better chance than not.
[2308.30 --> 2312.30]  If it's like, what instrument did your parents make you play?
[2312.30 --> 2316.30]  And it's like, okay, so it's the Asian kid. Piano, right?
[2316.30 --> 2319.30]  It's like, no. Piano and flute.
[2319.30 --> 2323.30]  No offense. I'm sure I offended someone.
[2323.30 --> 2333.30]  What was really cool, when I was at BCIT, they had a piano in the common hall. And it's BCIT. So I'd be sitting there studying and then every once in a while.
[2333.30 --> 2334.30]  Good shots exploding.
[2334.30 --> 2335.30]  I know, I know.
[2335.30 --> 2338.30]  I should pull the Linda Lower Third off that part at least.
[2338.30 --> 2342.30]  It's BCIT. So every once in a while, someone would come up and play the piano.
[2342.30 --> 2343.30]  Yeah.
[2343.30 --> 2356.30]  And like, there was amazingly good people. And it was wonderful. I don't know. I got like classical music played to me while I was like live classical music from very skilled pianists played to me while I was studying.
[2356.30 --> 2358.30]  I was like, this is amazing.
[2358.30 --> 2360.30]  Oh, violin. Sorry, I missed violin.
[2360.30 --> 2361.30]  Oh, yeah.
[2361.30 --> 2362.30]  That is a legitimate alternative.
[2362.30 --> 2363.30]  Yeah.
[2363.30 --> 2372.30]  You know, I, if I was going to pick up an instrument, it would be the violin. For one reason.
[2372.30 --> 2389.30]  I have small fingers. So a real guitar is not an option. No, that's not actually the reason. Because I think that the problem with fiddle music, and yes, I know a fiddle is a violin. It's just a different style of playing.
[2389.30 --> 2402.30]  I think the problem with high energy violin music is that it's all like country music. I think that high energy violin, and if people have artist suggestions, Twitter, not now.
[2402.30 --> 2405.30]  Who's that super famous chick on YouTube? Doesn't she play violin?
[2405.30 --> 2406.30]  Yeah.
[2406.30 --> 2407.30]  Yeah.
[2407.30 --> 2408.30]  Isn't that high energy?
[2408.30 --> 2417.30]  Yeah, but like, okay. If people send me suggestions on Twitter later tonight, I will check them out and I will let you know which ones are the ones that I'm thinking of.
[2417.30 --> 2422.30]  Something Sterling? Lindsay Sterling? Lindsay, I don't know.
[2422.30 --> 2426.30]  What's the thing? Percussion gives you athletic skills?
[2426.30 --> 2427.30]  Lindsay Sterling.
[2427.30 --> 2439.30]  Lindsay Sterling. Okay. Anyway, my point is, that's the style of music that if I was going to create anything, I would want that to be it. So that would be my thing. I have no idea where I was going with this. Right.
[2439.30 --> 2440.30]  We're done, Linda.com.
[2440.30 --> 2441.30]  Sponsors.

[2451.30 --> 2452.30]  What do you want, Nick?
[2452.30 --> 2455.30]  Yeah, usually when he comes by, he's telling us we did something wrong.
[2455.30 --> 2456.30]  What do you want?
[2456.30 --> 2457.30]  Yeah, you too, buddy.
[2457.30 --> 2458.30]  Why are you wearing those shirts?
[2458.30 --> 2459.30]  Oh, uh...
[2459.30 --> 2460.30]  Very good reason. Tell you later.
[2460.30 --> 2461.30]  Very good reason. We'll tell you later.
[2461.30 --> 2462.30]  Okay.
[2462.30 --> 2463.30]  Okay.

[2470.30 --> 2474.30]  Make a website for your son who's like really good at reading and wants to play sports and martial arts and...
[2474.30 --> 2475.30]  You're not gonna do it?
[2475.30 --> 2476.30]  Uh...
[2476.30 --> 2477.30]  Build it beautiful!
[2477.30 --> 2479.30]  Thank you!
[2479.30 --> 2484.30]  Uh, Squarespace has a wide variety of templates whether you want to build a blog or a store.
[2484.30 --> 2485.30]  Which are beautiful.
[2485.30 --> 2486.30]  Or, uh...
[2486.30 --> 2487.30]  And you can build them.
[2487.30 --> 2488.30]  Company portfolio.
[2488.30 --> 2492.30]  Hey, do we have our new, uh, do we have our new pictures on our company site yet?
[2492.30 --> 2493.30]  I doubt it.
[2493.30 --> 2494.30]  I super doubt it.
[2494.30 --> 2495.30]  Just cause everyone's been busy?
[2495.30 --> 2496.30]  Oh yeah.
[2496.30 --> 2497.30]  I think this will take forever.
[2497.30 --> 2498.30]  If I click on our team, is it gonna be there?
[2498.30 --> 2499.30]  No.
[2499.30 --> 2500.30]  Nope.
[2500.30 --> 2502.30]  Is everyone even on here?
[2502.30 --> 2503.30]  There are literally no pictures at all.
[2503.30 --> 2504.30]  Is Colton on here?
[2504.30 --> 2505.30]  No Col...
[2505.30 --> 2506.30]  Oh, yes.
[2506.30 --> 2507.30]  Oh, yes!
[2507.30 --> 2508.30]  Oh my god.
[2508.30 --> 2510.30]  Colton's profile is pathetic.
[2510.30 --> 2511.30]  Okay.
[2511.30 --> 2513.30]  So it starts at the beginning.
[2513.30 --> 2514.30]  So I get...
[2514.30 --> 2515.30]  I get six lines.
[2515.30 --> 2517.30]  Luke gets seven lines.
[2517.30 --> 2521.30]  Ed, who actually did the site in the first place,
[2521.30 --> 2524.30]  gets nine lines.
[2524.30 --> 2526.30]  Brandon, I believe, updated his.
[2526.30 --> 2528.30]  Taren's got like eight lines.
[2528.30 --> 2530.30]  And then we got lazy.
[2530.30 --> 2532.30]  Nick has three lines.
[2532.30 --> 2534.30]  Colton gets one and...
[2534.30 --> 2535.30]  1.1 lines.
[2535.30 --> 2536.30]  Read his line though.
[2536.30 --> 2537.30]  Read his line.
[2537.30 --> 2542.30]  Colton does sales and business development, but in a lighter capacity than Nick.
[2542.30 --> 2543.30]  Wow!
[2543.30 --> 2544.30]  Oh my god!
[2544.30 --> 2545.30]  Who wrote that?
[2545.30 --> 2546.30]  I don't know.
[2546.30 --> 2547.30]  Probably Nick.
[2547.30 --> 2548.30]  You know, Colton works here, but he's not as cool as Nick.
[2548.30 --> 2549.30]  So...
[2549.30 --> 2550.30]  Oh man.
[2550.30 --> 2551.30]  That's brutal!
[2551.30 --> 2552.30]  Colton, do you hear this?
[2552.30 --> 2553.30]  John is our first foreign worker?
[2553.30 --> 2555.30]  Who is writing this stuff?
[2555.30 --> 2556.30]  United States of...
[2556.30 --> 2557.30]  What?
[2557.30 --> 2558.30]  What?
[2558.30 --> 2559.30]  You so wrote them.
[2559.30 --> 2560.30]  What?
[2560.30 --> 2561.30]  What?
[2561.30 --> 2562.30]  You so wrote them.
[2562.30 --> 2563.30]  No, I wrote some of them.
[2563.30 --> 2564.30]  I didn't write Colton's.
[2564.30 --> 2565.30]  I wrote...
[2565.30 --> 2569.30]  I rewrote Dennis's terrible one that said...
[2569.30 --> 2571.30]  That was like racist.
[2571.30 --> 2572.30]  He wrote his.
[2572.30 --> 2573.30]  You wrote yours?
[2573.30 --> 2574.30]  You wrote it yourself, Colton?
[2574.30 --> 2575.30]  You're terrible!
[2575.30 --> 2578.30]  Yeah, hey, you're still on your 90 day probation.
[2578.30 --> 2581.30]  You're fired for writing a terrible bio for yourself.
[2581.30 --> 2583.30]  I had one day left in my probation!
[2583.30 --> 2586.30]  Squarespace tries to give us these beautiful tools, and we just write terrible things on
[2586.30 --> 2587.30]  it.
[2587.30 --> 2589.30]  You're terrible!
[2589.30 --> 2592.30]  You're fired for writing a terrible bio for yourself!
[2592.30 --> 2594.30]  I had one day left in my probation!
[2594.30 --> 2595.30]  Okay, I'll be right back!
[2595.30 --> 2596.30]  I'll be right back!
[2596.30 --> 2597.30]  That's okay.
[2597.30 --> 2598.30]  I'll be right back!
[2598.30 --> 2599.30]  Because we're not allowed to write them!
[2599.30 --> 2602.30]  We have these beautiful tools, and we just write terrible things on it.
[2602.30 --> 2603.30]  Yeah, so...
[2603.30 --> 2604.30]  The website looks good!
[2604.30 --> 2609.30]  The point we're trying to make is that your Squarespace site will be functional and beautiful,
[2609.30 --> 2613.30]  but it is still up to you to make sure that the content isn't totally rubbish.
[2613.30 --> 2617.30]  The tagline is build it beautiful, but there's an actionable part of that which we're apparently
[2617.30 --> 2618.30]  not really doing.
[2618.30 --> 2619.30]  Build!
[2619.30 --> 2620.30]  They don't just do it for you.
[2620.30 --> 2621.30]  It's not like...
[2621.30 --> 2622.30]  They do a lot of it for you.
[2622.30 --> 2626.30]  It's not like, lie there like a vegetable, beautiful.
[2626.30 --> 2627.30]  Oh dear.
[2627.30 --> 2629.30]  Like, it's ridiculous.
[2629.30 --> 2632.30]  Yeah, you have to actually put some amount of work into it.
[2632.30 --> 2638.30]  Alright, so if you guys want to try out Squarespace, you can start your free trial today with no credit card required at squarespace.com,
[2638.30 --> 2642.30]  and if you use offer code Linus, you can save 10% off your first purchase.
[2642.30 --> 2643.30]  Alright, let's...
[2643.30 --> 2646.30]  Can we just try and do like a straight sponsor read for this one?
[2646.30 --> 2648.30]  Can we try and just...
[2648.30 --> 2650.30]  I mean, we can try.
[2650.30 --> 2651.30]  Okay, so...
[2651.30 --> 2652.30]  Fresh books!
[2652.30 --> 2657.30]  I'm deciding whether to go there or not.
[2657.30 --> 2661.30]  Cause there's talk in Canada of legalizing prostitution.
[2661.30 --> 2662.30]  Oh...
[2662.30 --> 2663.30]  Okay, no we won't go there.
[2663.30 --> 2669.30]  So, fresh books for your small business, whether you're a plumber or a PC repair person...
[2669.30 --> 2670.30]  Or one of those plumbers.
[2670.30 --> 2671.30]  Or...
[2671.30 --> 2674.30]  If you're working on anything else, any time of day.
[2674.30 --> 2684.30]  Fresh books, when you're on the go, you know, if you're out in your plumbing van, and you're plumbing things, and you want to keep track of your hours and your invoices.
[2684.30 --> 2686.30]  I am sure I'm getting a complaint about this.
[2686.30 --> 2690.30]  Fresh books allows you to keep track of all those little details.
[2690.30 --> 2693.30]  You can send invoices to your clients.
[2693.30 --> 2694.30]  Um...
[2694.30 --> 2695.30]  I just got a message.
[2695.30 --> 2698.30]  They have intuitive and easy to use tools.
[2698.30 --> 2699.30]  You can...
[2699.30 --> 2700.30]  Uh...
[2700.30 --> 2701.30]  You can...
[2701.30 --> 2702.30]  You can...
[2702.30 --> 2704.30]  Poor Nick.
[2704.30 --> 2705.30]  Uh...
[2705.30 --> 2706.30]  You can send invoices to your clients.
[2706.30 --> 2710.30]  You can bill your clients through the app via credit card.
[2710.30 --> 2712.30]  So you can get a confirmation when they've...
[2712.30 --> 2713.30]  When they've viewed it.
[2713.30 --> 2714.30]  You can...
[2714.30 --> 2715.30]  Wow!
[2715.30 --> 2716.30]  Um...
[2716.30 --> 2717.30]  Oh, this is great.
[2717.30 --> 2719.30]  Fresh books actually just launched.
[2719.30 --> 2721.30]  Their deposits feature.
[2721.30 --> 2722.30]  Yeah.
[2722.30 --> 2724.30]  So if you're like a house painter, for example, um...
[2724.30 --> 2725.30]  You...
[2725.30 --> 2732.30]  You would take a deposit at the time of booking the job because frankly, as a former house painter, I can tell you that's critical.
[2732.30 --> 2733.30]  Absolutely critical.
[2733.30 --> 2737.30]  So that you can go buy paint and show up at the job with paint and brushes and stuff.
[2737.30 --> 2738.30]  Um...
[2738.30 --> 2741.30]  So you can take your deposit and then you can build a balance also through fresh books.
[2741.30 --> 2743.30]  So what's the point of fresh books?
[2743.30 --> 2744.30]  Okay.
[2744.30 --> 2748.30]  Cloud-based accounting service that allows you to focus on running your small business instead of crunching your money.
[2748.30 --> 2752.30]  Crunching numbers about your small business every day at the end of the day.
[2752.30 --> 2757.30]  So visit freshbooks.com slash when and enter when in the how did you hear about us section.
[2757.30 --> 2760.30]  My phone is going berserk right now.
[2760.30 --> 2761.30]  Um...
[2761.30 --> 2762.30]  Oh wow.
[2762.30 --> 2766.30]  Nick saw it coming a mile away.
[2766.30 --> 2767.30]  Please!
[2767.30 --> 2769.30]  Don't bring up prostitution.
[2769.30 --> 2771.30]  We just got a new rep.
[2771.30 --> 2772.30]  Please!
[2772.30 --> 2774.30]  This is their first spot.
[2774.30 --> 2775.30]  Why?
[2775.30 --> 2778.30]  I hate you guys so much!
[2778.30 --> 2779.30]  You know why?
[2779.30 --> 2787.30]  You know why that tagline probably says that Colton does it in a lower capacity than Nick?
[2787.30 --> 2788.30]  Why?
[2788.30 --> 2791.30]  Because I don't think we troll Colton.
[2791.30 --> 2792.30]  Yeah.
[2792.30 --> 2793.30]  We troll the crap out of Nick.
[2793.30 --> 2794.30]  Poor Nick.
[2794.30 --> 2796.30]  I think Nick's gonna have a heart attack in his 30s.
[2796.30 --> 2797.30]  If he makes it that far.
[2797.30 --> 2798.30]  Yeah.
[2798.30 --> 2799.30]  Sorry about that.
[2799.30 --> 2800.30]  Alright.
[2800.30 --> 2803.30]  What else do we got on the show today?
[2803.30 --> 2805.30]  I love this show.
[2805.30 --> 2806.30]  Yeah.
[2806.30 --> 2808.30]  Oh, this is some good stuff.
[2808.30 --> 2814.30]  So AMD faces a class action suit over bulldozer misrepresentation.
[2814.30 --> 2825.30]  Now to be clear, the class action suit does not allege that AMD marketed their product as a bulldozer, only to have customers buy it and realize that all their dirt was still there.
[2825.30 --> 2826.30]  Yeah, that would be disappointing.
[2826.30 --> 2828.30]  That would be disappointing.
[2828.30 --> 2838.30]  No, what the suit alleges is that AMD misrepresented the core count of, for example, their 8 core bulldozer processor.
[2838.30 --> 2851.30]  So, the way that AMD's module system worked, and I say works, not because there aren't still processors that use it, that there are, but because it looks like with their upcoming Zen cores, that's going away.
[2851.30 --> 2860.30]  The way that it worked is that each module had two integer units, and then some shared cache, and a shared floating point unit.
[2860.30 --> 2868.30]  So, from the sort of strictest traditional standpoint, they were not full cores.
[2868.30 --> 2879.30]  But people who say that they are like hyper-threaded cores are not correct either, because they can process much more than an individual core.
[2879.30 --> 2884.30]  The best way that I would describe them is like, is 1.5 cores each.
[2884.30 --> 2887.30]  So, where's this going?
[2887.30 --> 2888.30]  Oh, I don't know, probably nowhere.
[2888.30 --> 2892.30]  Everyone probably gets a $10 rebate in 8 years or something like that at AMD status.
[2892.30 --> 2894.30]  You actually think this is going to go through?
[2894.30 --> 2902.30]  Because honestly, my thing on this is, yes, it was kind of weird to an average consumer, to be completely honest.
[2902.30 --> 2903.30]  Yeah.
[2903.30 --> 2904.30]  I agree.
[2904.30 --> 2907.30]  But, it wasn't like they didn't try.
[2907.30 --> 2914.30]  But, well, yeah, but try, AMD try and like effective is not the same thing.
[2914.30 --> 2921.30]  And you got to understand that we're not just talking about consumers who went to the store and bought an FX-8150, okay?
[2921.30 --> 2927.30]  We're talking about consumers who went to Best Buy and bought an HP Pavilion something or other.
[2927.30 --> 2929.30]  Because it had more cores than the other.
[2929.30 --> 2931.30]  Because it had 8 cores.
[2931.30 --> 2933.30]  That tag down there.
[2933.30 --> 2937.30]  AMD's try does not extend to that one tag under the same with Best Buy.
[2937.30 --> 2944.30]  I got my $20 rebate for buying whatever RAM in whenever the hell.
[2944.30 --> 2945.30]  Like some Rambus crap or something?
[2945.30 --> 2946.30]  Yeah.
[2946.30 --> 2947.30]  Really?
[2947.30 --> 2948.30]  Yeah.
[2948.30 --> 2949.30]  Wow, okay.
[2949.30 --> 2950.30]  It showed up, checked for $20.
[2950.30 --> 2953.30]  I was like, okay, whenever I go to the bank next, I guess.
[2953.30 --> 2954.30]  That's awesome.
[2954.30 --> 2955.30]  That's cool.
[2955.30 --> 2956.30]  I don't know.
[2956.30 --> 2957.30]  Yeah.
[2957.30 --> 2958.30]  It only took like two years, I think.
[2958.30 --> 2959.30]  I swear.
[2959.30 --> 2965.30]  AMD fans are the most difficult to penetrate group on the entire internet.
[2965.30 --> 2967.30]  8350 is 8 core.
[2967.30 --> 2968.30]  Stop being stupid.
[2968.30 --> 2971.30]  Actually, it's not that simple.
[2971.30 --> 2973.30]  Life is very rarely that simple.
[2973.30 --> 2977.30]  That's, I guess, all I can really say about it at this point because I give up.
[2977.30 --> 2979.30]  Unless you're playing the piano.
[2979.30 --> 2987.30]  Alright, so I guess that's pretty much all that, yeah, the blah, blah, blah results in etc. etc.
[2987.30 --> 2993.30]  Oh, so it's still a little early for us to wear them.
[2993.30 --> 2994.30]  No, no, no, no.
[2994.30 --> 2995.30]  Trust me, bad idea.
[2995.30 --> 2997.30]  Okay, well forget it then.
[2997.30 --> 2999.30]  There's LTT stickers available.
[2999.30 --> 3012.30]  So over on teespring.com slash LTT stickers, we've got apparently 56 people have bought a Linus Tech Tips logo sticker for $9.
[3012.30 --> 3014.30]  I haven't seen the stickers.
[3014.30 --> 3016.30]  Yeah, well, it's pretty simple.
[3016.30 --> 3018.30]  It's just like a Linus Tech Tips logo.
[3018.30 --> 3019.30]  There you go.
[3019.30 --> 3021.30]  So it's just a short seven-day campaign.
[3021.30 --> 3023.30]  It's available for another four days.
[3023.30 --> 3027.30]  Something a lot of people have been asking about lately.
[3027.30 --> 3029.30]  Stickers aside, so you guys can check out the stickers if you're into that.
[3029.30 --> 3031.30]  But stick, oh, oh, right.
[3031.30 --> 3033.30]  I was, I'm supposed to bring this up.
[3033.30 --> 3037.30]  The reason it has like such huge black borders is so that you can kind of cut it to whatever size you want.
[3037.30 --> 3039.30]  I was gonna say, I was like, how big is this?
[3039.30 --> 3041.30]  Does it even say how big it is?
[3041.30 --> 3042.30]  Like actual dimensions?
[3042.30 --> 3043.30]  I don't know.
[3043.30 --> 3044.30]  I don't know anything about this.
[3044.30 --> 3045.30]  It just says it's landscape.
[3045.30 --> 3047.30]  This is a Lick Knight project.
[3047.30 --> 3048.30]  A Lick Knight project.
[3048.30 --> 3049.30]  This is a Nick Light project.
[3049.30 --> 3052.30]  That sounds like a Shovel Knight thing.
[3052.30 --> 3053.30]  Yeah.
[3053.30 --> 3054.30]  Lick Knight?
[3054.30 --> 3055.30]  Lick Knight.
[3055.30 --> 3057.30]  Oh, view sizing chart and things.
[3057.30 --> 3059.30]  So it's 3.6 inches by 5 inches.
[3059.30 --> 3060.30]  Where does it say that?
[3060.30 --> 3062.30]  Oh, maybe you can buy different sizes.
[3062.30 --> 3064.30]  You buy different sizes, you pick your size.
[3064.30 --> 3065.30]  Oh, there.
[3065.30 --> 3066.30]  Yeah.
[3066.30 --> 3067.30]  So there you go.
[3067.30 --> 3068.30]  There's a sticker.
[3068.30 --> 3069.30]  So it's a Nick Light project.
[3069.30 --> 3071.30]  And he asked me to bring up that you can buy different sizes.
[3071.30 --> 3073.30]  And he asked me to bring up that you could just cut it to size.
[3073.30 --> 3074.30]  And I was like, okay, sure.
[3074.30 --> 3075.30]  That sounds cool.
[3075.30 --> 3077.30]  But then what if you wanted a 5x7?
[3077.30 --> 3079.30]  What if you just want to calm down?
[3079.30 --> 3085.30]  So we've had a lot of people asking, not about stickers necessarily, but about our other merch.
[3085.30 --> 3090.30]  Because they've noticed that our District Line store is completely empty.
[3090.30 --> 3096.30]  We are going to be launching a new store very soon on Teespring.
[3096.30 --> 3097.30]  That will happen.
[3097.30 --> 3101.30]  And when we launch, because Teespring has traditionally just been like, here's a design.
[3101.30 --> 3102.30]  We're doing a campaign.
[3102.30 --> 3104.30]  But we're going to have a store.
[3104.30 --> 3111.30]  And when that happens, we're going to bring back, if not all, most of the designs that we've ever done.
[3111.30 --> 3114.30]  So they will all be available again.
[3114.30 --> 3118.30]  And then the way that it works is they'll all be kind of like mini campaigns.
[3118.30 --> 3122.30]  So it's going to be sort of like, I don't know what I would call it.
[3122.30 --> 3128.30]  Like it'd be kind of like a mass drop page that never goes away.
[3128.30 --> 3133.30]  So like every time it reaches 50 people who commit, the counter resets and it ships those 50 out.
[3133.30 --> 3134.30]  Yeah.
[3134.30 --> 3135.30]  Or something like that, right?
[3135.30 --> 3136.30]  I think that's how it goes.
[3136.30 --> 3137.30]  Yeah.
[3137.30 --> 3140.30]  So that's pretty much like kind of how it's going to work.
[3140.30 --> 3143.30]  This is interesting.
[3143.30 --> 3149.30]  So Apple patents a switchless force touch keyboard.
[3149.30 --> 3153.30]  I mean, it's not like this idea has never been thought of before.
[3153.30 --> 3155.30]  Like laser projected keyboards and touchscreen keyboards.
[3155.30 --> 3157.30]  I don't want this at all.
[3157.30 --> 3162.30]  Like I just, I even read the headline and I was like, don't.
[3162.30 --> 3166.30]  So the idea is that this would allow their MacBooks to be thinner than ever.
[3166.30 --> 3168.30]  I don't care.
[3169.30 --> 3170.30]  Thinner than ever.
[3170.30 --> 3172.30]  Lighter than ever.
[3174.30 --> 3176.30]  You're not going to buy a MacBook anyway. What do you care?
[3176.30 --> 3178.30]  Well, because then the rest of the industry will do it.
[3178.30 --> 3179.30]  Yeah.
[3179.30 --> 3182.30]  Like, that's basically how this stuff works.
[3182.30 --> 3186.30]  Usually in the past, Apple was leading all of these kinds of things.
[3186.30 --> 3192.30]  For the last little while, maybe not so much in every department or any of them.
[3193.30 --> 3198.30]  But nowadays, if Apple does this, it's very possible that everyone else is going to do this.
[3198.30 --> 3202.30]  And honestly, their current popular laptop thing.
[3202.30 --> 3204.30]  Didn't we use that for Scrapyard Wars?
[3204.30 --> 3205.30]  MacBook Air.
[3205.30 --> 3206.30]  Yeah.
[3206.30 --> 3207.30]  Yeah.
[3207.30 --> 3208.30]  That was fine.
[3208.30 --> 3209.30]  Popular laptop thing.
[3209.30 --> 3210.30]  I don't know anything about those guys.
[3210.30 --> 3211.30]  Whatever.
[3211.30 --> 3213.30]  The battery lasted a long time.
[3213.30 --> 3215.30]  The keyboard was actually pretty good.
[3215.30 --> 3217.30]  It web-browsed just fine.
[3217.30 --> 3218.30]  That's all I needed it for.
[3218.30 --> 3219.30]  It was great.
[3219.30 --> 3220.30]  Mission accomplished.
[3220.30 --> 3221.30]  I didn't pay for it.
[3221.30 --> 3222.30]  I don't care how expensive it was.
[3222.30 --> 3223.30]  Wasn't relevant to Scrapyard Wars.
[3223.30 --> 3224.30]  To be clear, we also didn't keep them.
[3224.30 --> 3225.30]  We also didn't keep them.
[3225.30 --> 3226.30]  So paying for them is super dumb.
[3226.30 --> 3228.30]  I'm just saying, like, I didn't buy the laptop, so I know people are going to be like,
[3228.30 --> 3230.30]  But it's overpriced!
[3230.30 --> 3231.30]  And I'm going to be like, I know.
[3231.30 --> 3232.30]  I didn't pay for it.
[3232.30 --> 3233.30]  That doesn't make it a bad piece of hardware.
[3233.30 --> 3234.30]  Exactly.
[3234.30 --> 3235.30]  It was fine.
[3235.30 --> 3236.30]  It was good.
[3236.30 --> 3237.30]  It was fine.
[3237.30 --> 3241.30]  Whereas, arguably, a laptop with a touch screen keyboard is a bad piece of hardware.
[3241.30 --> 3242.30]  Probably bad.
[3242.30 --> 3243.30]  Regardless of its price.
[3243.30 --> 3247.30]  Now, with that said, okay, you've used the Steam Controller, right?
[3247.30 --> 3248.30]  Yes.
[3248.30 --> 3255.30]  So having haptic feedback for when you move back and forth on something with a better vibration motor.
[3255.30 --> 3256.30]  Yeah.
[3256.30 --> 3257.30]  Could be not terrible.
[3257.30 --> 3258.30]  And...
[3258.30 --> 3259.30]  More on that later.
[3259.30 --> 3260.30]  As someone who...
[3260.30 --> 3261.30]  Not today.
[3261.30 --> 3271.30]  Who I personally feel that on the MacBook 2015, which has the Force Touch trackpad, the actual...
[3271.30 --> 3275.30]  The click feels a lot like a click.
[3275.30 --> 3277.30]  It really does.
[3277.30 --> 3282.30]  If they executed it perfectly, maybe you've got my attention.
[3282.30 --> 3286.30]  But what they would have to do is maybe have like...
[3286.30 --> 3289.30]  They'd have to have some way for me to find the home row still.
[3289.30 --> 3290.30]  Yeah.
[3290.30 --> 3291.30]  It would have to be like...
[3291.30 --> 3293.30]  You'd still have to have like a grid on it or something that I can feel.
[3293.30 --> 3294.30]  Yeah.
[3294.30 --> 3295.30]  Even if the keys are touch.
[3295.30 --> 3296.30]  Yeah.
[3296.30 --> 3297.30]  If they solve that, it might not be that bad of a problem.
[3297.30 --> 3299.30]  My thing is being able to feel the keys still.
[3299.30 --> 3303.30]  I don't look at the keyboard when I type, but I can feel physical keys.
[3303.30 --> 3304.30]  Yes.
[3304.30 --> 3307.30]  So, if they find some way to solve that problem, sure.
[3307.30 --> 3308.30]  But I just...
[3308.30 --> 3310.30]  I haven't heard anything about that.
[3310.30 --> 3311.30]  All right.
[3311.30 --> 3312.30]  Linus doesn't smoke.
[3312.30 --> 3313.30]  He's coughing because he's sick.
[3313.30 --> 3315.30]  It's amazing how many people were like...
[3315.30 --> 3316.30]  Getting super judgy about...
[3316.30 --> 3317.30]  Yeah, we'll talk about that next.
[3317.30 --> 3331.30]  It's amazing how many people were getting super judgy about how I smoke and I'm a bad person
[3331.30 --> 3332.30]  on our old office tour.
[3332.30 --> 3333.30]  Oh.
[3333.30 --> 3337.30]  Because I had a pack of cigarettes on my desk.
[3337.30 --> 3338.30]  Oh, those were the...
[3338.30 --> 3343.30]  They were literally FX cigarettes, okay?
[3343.30 --> 3348.30]  We paid like a fair amount so that we could get fake ones so that he wouldn't have to smoke.
[3348.30 --> 3351.30]  Let me see if I can find the...
[3351.30 --> 3352.30]  Here they are.
[3352.30 --> 3353.30]  Here they are.
[3353.30 --> 3354.30]  Here they are.
[3354.30 --> 3355.30]  They're from newrulefx.com.
[3355.30 --> 3359.30]  That is the pack of cigarettes that was on my desk, okay?
[3359.30 --> 3360.30]  So y'all can just...
[3360.30 --> 3362.30]  Y'all can just calm down.
[3362.30 --> 3363.30]  Thank you.
[3363.30 --> 3365.30]  Um...
[3365.30 --> 3366.30]  All right.
[3366.30 --> 3368.30]  Let's move on to our next topic.
[3368.30 --> 3369.30]  Diablo 2.
[3369.30 --> 3370.30]  Oh.
[3370.30 --> 3375.30]  Starcraft 1 and Warcraft 3 HD Remakes.
[3375.30 --> 3376.30]  Possibly coming.
[3376.30 --> 3377.30]  Now...
[3377.30 --> 3378.30]  Thank you.
[3378.30 --> 3379.30]  To be clear.
[3379.30 --> 3383.30]  Possibly coming is just based on a job posting.
[3383.30 --> 3384.30]  It's okay.
[3384.30 --> 3385.30]  I'm gonna read out the job posting because...
[3385.30 --> 3386.30]  And there's no timeline.
[3386.30 --> 3387.30]  Yeah.
[3387.30 --> 3388.30]  At all.
[3388.30 --> 3389.30]  Yeah.
[3389.30 --> 3392.30]  So like, don't hold your breath or hold your pee or hold anything.
[3392.30 --> 3396.30]  Compelling stories, intense multiplayer, endless replayability.
[3396.30 --> 3400.30]  Qualities that made Starcraft, Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2 the titans they are today.
[3400.30 --> 3403.30]  Evolving operating systems, hardware and online services have made them more difficult
[3403.30 --> 3406.30]  to be experienced by their loyal followers...
[3406.30 --> 3409.30]  By their loyal followers our...
[3409.30 --> 3410.30]  Or...
[3410.30 --> 3411.30]  Or reaching a new generation.
[3411.30 --> 3413.30]  Or restoring them to glory, blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[3413.30 --> 3414.30]  We need your engineering talents.
[3414.30 --> 3415.30]  So like, they're doing something.
[3415.30 --> 3416.30]  Yeah.
[3416.30 --> 3420.30]  Whether or not it's just compatibility for newer systems or it is actually a HD remake,
[3420.30 --> 3421.30]  I don't know.
[3421.30 --> 3425.30]  Because it says right on it, some responsibilities listed as own implementation and curation
[3425.30 --> 3428.30]  of features, new and old.
[3428.30 --> 3430.30]  Diagnose and fix all the things.
[3430.30 --> 3434.30]  Crashes, deadlocks, overthrows, heat corruptions, etc.
[3434.30 --> 3435.30]  So it's...
[3435.30 --> 3439.30]  It is very unclear what restoring them to glory means.
[3439.30 --> 3441.30]  But they're doing something and that's cool.
[3441.30 --> 3443.30]  I would love for it to be HD remakes.
[3443.30 --> 3444.30]  Yes.
[3444.30 --> 3445.30]  Ultra HD please, actually.
[3445.30 --> 3446.30]  Yes.
[3446.30 --> 3448.30]  But then with the way Blizzard goes, you know.
[3448.30 --> 3449.30]  Maybe not so much.
[3449.30 --> 3450.30]  Maybe not Ultra HD.
[3450.30 --> 3451.30]  Maybe it'll be like...
[3451.30 --> 3452.30]  960p.
[3452.30 --> 3453.30]  Wrecked.
[3453.30 --> 3454.30]  In Blizzard's defense, their art style does...
[3454.30 --> 3455.30]  It does a really good job.
[3455.30 --> 3467.30]  Their like low polygon count art style does translate really well to high resolution screens
[3467.30 --> 3468.30]  and all that stuff.
[3468.30 --> 3469.30]  I'm not hating on the...
[3469.30 --> 3470.30]  I'm sure the Twitch chat is exploding already.
[3470.30 --> 3471.30]  They know what they're doing.
[3471.30 --> 3472.30]  They know what they're doing.
[3472.30 --> 3473.30]  Yeah, they do know what they're doing.
[3473.30 --> 3474.30]  I'm excited.
[3474.30 --> 3475.30]  That's super cool.
[3475.30 --> 3480.30]  If they release an HD remake of Warcraft 3, I would be head over heels happy.
[3480.30 --> 3481.30]  Don't worry about that one.
[3481.30 --> 3482.30]  Ignore that one.
[3482.30 --> 3483.30]  This one, why?
[3483.30 --> 3484.30]  Super boring.
[3484.30 --> 3485.30]  Oh, I thought it was interesting.
[3485.30 --> 3486.30]  I've had it for like almost a whole year.
[3486.30 --> 3487.30]  Yeah, I know.
[3487.30 --> 3488.30]  Okay.
[3488.30 --> 3489.30]  But it's beta now.
[3489.30 --> 3490.30]  But who cares?
[3490.30 --> 3491.30]  Okay, fine.
[3491.30 --> 3492.30]  You can do it if you want.
[3492.30 --> 3493.30]  Yeah, let's do the next one then.
[3493.30 --> 3494.30]  Alright.
[3494.30 --> 3496.30]  Sennheiser office.
[3496.30 --> 3499.30]  Dun dun dun.
[3499.30 --> 3503.30]  Have you ever wanted to spend $55,000 on a pair of headphones?
[3503.30 --> 3505.30]  Now you can.
[3505.30 --> 3506.30]  Yeah.
[3506.30 --> 3511.30]  If you're one of the 250 people a year who will be permitted to buy it.
[3511.30 --> 3512.30]  So...
[3514.30 --> 3518.30]  In 1990, this is like straight off of Sennheiser's website.
[3518.30 --> 3519.30]  Sennheiser...
[3519.30 --> 3523.30]  Well, Tech Insider, but I'm pretty sure they got it straight off of Sennheiser's website.
[3523.30 --> 3530.30]  In 1990, Sennheiser engineers set out to create the best headphones in the world.
[3530.30 --> 3533.30]  The result was the legendary Sennheiser Orpheus.
[3533.30 --> 3537.30]  A pair of $16,000 audiophile headphones.
[3537.30 --> 3545.30]  So sophisticated, they even came with their own tube amplifier that looked like something taken from a mad scientist lab.
[3545.30 --> 3548.30]  If you're some kind of tool who has never seen a tube amplifier before.
[3548.30 --> 3550.30]  Pretty sure he went off script there for a moment.
[3550.30 --> 3552.30]  Yeah, sorry, that last bit was me.
[3552.30 --> 3553.30]  That was good though, I liked it.
[3553.30 --> 3554.30]  So...
[3554.30 --> 3555.30]  Good emphasis.
[3555.30 --> 3556.30]  Now...
[3556.30 --> 3557.30]  Thank you.
[3557.30 --> 3559.30]  I never put it on the wrong syllable.
[3559.30 --> 3560.30]  Um...
[3560.30 --> 3563.30]  Oh, classic joke.
[3563.30 --> 3565.30]  Careful, I bet you might break it!
[3565.30 --> 3566.30]  Oh!
[3566.30 --> 3567.30]  Um...
[3567.30 --> 3568.30]  Um...
[3568.30 --> 3569.30]  So...
[3569.30 --> 3572.30]  When I first got the press release for this...
[3572.30 --> 3573.30]  You're gonna freak out.
[3573.30 --> 3575.30]  Did you ask for a review sample?
[3575.30 --> 3576.30]  No.
[3576.30 --> 3577.30]  No.
[3577.30 --> 3578.30]  What I asked for...
[3578.30 --> 3579.30]  You're gonna freak out.
[3579.30 --> 3583.30]  What I asked for was the first unit, and that I would buy them.
[3584.30 --> 3585.30]  Because...
[3585.30 --> 3587.30]  You know what's really weird?
[3587.30 --> 3589.30]  I know you're freaking out, but you need to calm down.
[3589.30 --> 3590.30]  No.
[3590.30 --> 3593.30]  What was really weird was I looked at this article and I was like, maybe we should buy one.
[3593.30 --> 3595.30]  I'm not even kidding.
[3595.30 --> 3596.30]  I'm not kidding at all.
[3596.30 --> 3600.30]  I was like, you know, I look at Lou and stuff and sometimes they just go crazy and they just
[3600.30 --> 3602.30]  buy something really cool and then review it.
[3602.30 --> 3605.30]  And I'm like, maybe we should just buy an Orpheus.
[3605.30 --> 3608.30]  He does so many headphone reviews, like it might make sense.
[3608.30 --> 3609.30]  So...
[3609.30 --> 3612.30]  I was like, I was like, straight up, I was like...
[3612.30 --> 3613.30]  Because I was like, I wanna review this.
[3613.30 --> 3615.30]  And they're like, well...
[3615.30 --> 3616.30]  You can't.
[3616.30 --> 3617.30]  Because...
[3617.30 --> 3618.30]  Get rekt.
[3618.30 --> 3620.30]  We're gonna have like an auditioning booth at CES.
[3620.30 --> 3621.30]  You can hear them there.
[3621.30 --> 3622.30]  And I was like, no, no.
[3622.30 --> 3623.30]  You misunderstand.
[3623.30 --> 3624.30]  I'm gonna buy them.
[3624.30 --> 3626.30]  But I want the first one.
[3626.30 --> 3627.30]  For being me.
[3627.30 --> 3629.30]  And because I'm gonna review it.
[3629.30 --> 3632.30]  And then he's like, okay, well, here's some more detail.
[3632.30 --> 3634.30]  Can we get it signed by Sennheiser?
[3634.30 --> 3635.30]  I read into it...
[3635.30 --> 3636.30]  No, I'm not buying them anymore.
[3636.30 --> 3638.30]  I read into it even further.
[3638.30 --> 3639.30]  And only...
[3639.30 --> 3643.30]  Okay, so only 300 pairs of the original Orpheus exists today.
[3643.30 --> 3646.30]  And they typically go for tens of thousands of dollars on eBay.
[3646.30 --> 3648.30]  Much more than the purchase price.
[3648.30 --> 3652.30]  And so my initial take on it was like, I will just buy it and flip it.
[3652.30 --> 3654.30]  Because I don't care.
[3654.30 --> 3656.30]  Because it'll be a limited edition product.
[3656.30 --> 3660.30]  And I can get rid of it down the line without it actually costing anything.
[3660.30 --> 3662.30]  It's all about the slush fund, right?
[3662.30 --> 3663.30]  I talked about this.
[3663.30 --> 3667.30]  You don't have to buy everything and then like put it in a vault somewhere.
[3667.30 --> 3668.30]  You can buy it and sell it and get rid of it.
[3668.30 --> 3673.30]  And to be fair, when I said I was thinking about us just buying it, I fully expected it to be back out of the door.
[3673.30 --> 3675.30]  Probably as soon as possible.
[3675.30 --> 3676.30]  Yeah.
[3676.30 --> 3687.30]  The problem is that Sennheiser, I think, lost their way with what was so exclusive and interesting about the Orpheus.
[3687.30 --> 3688.30]  The original Orpheus.
[3688.30 --> 3692.30]  And they are producing 250 of these per year indefinitely.
[3692.30 --> 3697.30]  So, yeah, I get it that that's only 250 units a year.
[3697.30 --> 3703.30]  So you'll be one of like the only, you know, couple thousand people worldwide who can own one.
[3703.30 --> 3710.30]  But I seriously doubt that for the best head, even the best headphones in the world.
[3710.30 --> 3714.30]  Bearing in mind, the original Orpheus's were already that.
[3714.30 --> 3717.30]  And they go for about 30 grand on eBay.
[3717.30 --> 3727.30]  I seriously doubt that there's more than 250 people a year that are going to be willing to spend $55,000 on also the best headphones in the world.
[3727.30 --> 3739.30]  So I think Sennheiser has significantly overestimated the demand and at the same time killed what is so exclusive and legendary about the Orpheus.
[3739.30 --> 3743.30]  With that said, it might still sound great and that's cool and that's fine.
[3743.30 --> 3750.30]  But it means that from a collector standpoint, they've pretty much made it irrelevant from my personal perspective.
[3750.30 --> 3755.30]  Other people can agree or disagree with me, but I am no longer interested in owning one.
[3755.30 --> 3759.30]  I will listen to them at CES on the CES show floor.
[3759.30 --> 3762.30]  Someone in Twitch chat was like 30 grand just to listen to Taylor Swift.
[3762.30 --> 3769.30]  Hey, you know, maybe how else are you going to shake it off?
[3769.30 --> 3770.30]  All right.
[3770.30 --> 3773.30]  Maybe your boyfriend left you because you spent so much money on headphones.
[3773.30 --> 3774.30]  Yeah.
[3778.30 --> 3781.30]  So anyway, some, some details about it because I went completely off script on this.
[3781.30 --> 3784.30]  Sing a song about how he doesn't understand your purchasing decisions.
[3784.30 --> 3788.30]  And I just met you and this is, no, that was the other one.
[3788.30 --> 3789.30]  That was the different one.
[3789.30 --> 3793.30]  So handcrafted in Germany using over 6,000 components.
[3793.30 --> 3798.30]  Some components such as gold vaporized ceramic electrodes, which sound pretty BA I guess.
[3798.30 --> 3801.30]  Platinum vaporized diaphragms.
[3801.30 --> 3804.30]  Carata marble amplifier housing.
[3804.30 --> 3808.30]  Each amplifier control is created using a single piece of brass.
[3808.30 --> 3818.30]  Once the headphones are turned on, the quartz glass vacuum tubes rise up from the marble enclosure and emit a glow, which by the way, tube amps just kind of do.
[3818.30 --> 3827.30]  They feature digital amplification, which takes place inside the headphones, reducing interference from cord travel.
[3827.30 --> 3831.30]  I mean, we are talking some audiophile grade snake oil right here.
[3831.30 --> 3832.30]  You know what we bad ass?
[3832.30 --> 3833.30]  Sorry.
[3833.30 --> 3834.30]  They super won't.
[3834.30 --> 3837.30]  So like, I understand that before we, before we, I get it.
[3837.30 --> 3838.30]  It's okay.
[3838.30 --> 3839.30]  It's fine.
[3839.30 --> 3844.30]  They should send us on a factory tour where we see the whole line.
[3844.30 --> 3848.30]  So they should show us like, the Carrara marble.
[3848.30 --> 3849.30]  All 6,000 parts?
[3849.30 --> 3855.30]  Not only just that, but where they get the Carrara marble and where they get the platinum that they're using.
[3855.30 --> 3858.30]  And then like, we follow the whole chain of everything in.
[3858.30 --> 3860.30]  Yeah. So that would cost what? 50 grand to make?
[3860.30 --> 3861.30]  At least.
[3861.30 --> 3862.30]  Sure.
[3862.30 --> 3863.30]  More than that probably.
[3863.30 --> 3864.30]  Tell you what.
[3864.30 --> 3865.30]  Tell you what.
[3865.30 --> 3866.30]  We'd have to like fly around and stuff.
[3866.30 --> 3868.30]  You talk to CES or Sennheiser at CES.
[3868.30 --> 3869.30]  I told.
[3869.30 --> 3870.30]  You pitch it.
[3870.30 --> 3872.30]  You know what? Honestly, I would.
[3872.30 --> 3877.30]  And you probably know that at this point, but I also super know that they wouldn't do it.
[3877.30 --> 3878.30]  So like.
[3878.30 --> 3880.30]  And it wouldn't even make any sense from our perspective.
[3880.30 --> 3881.30]  No.
[3881.30 --> 3883.30]  We're going to be, we're going to be trucking all over Europe.
[3883.30 --> 3884.30]  For so long.
[3884.30 --> 3887.30]  To make a video about how headphones are made.
[3887.30 --> 3890.30]  When we legit already made a video about how headphones are made.
[3890.30 --> 3892.30]  How Sennheiser headphones are made.
[3892.30 --> 3893.30]  No.
[3893.30 --> 3897.30]  Part of the video would be like, how they mine the marble and the platinum.
[3897.30 --> 3903.30]  So you want to, you literally want to make, you want to remake, I collect rocks.
[3903.30 --> 3907.30]  And then listen to it on a $55,000 pair of headphones.
[3907.30 --> 3909.30]  That's what I'm hearing right now.
[3909.30 --> 3910.30]  Yeah.
[3910.30 --> 3911.30]  You're drunk.
[3911.30 --> 3913.30]  I said I knew it wouldn't happen.
[3913.30 --> 3914.30]  I just, I don't know.
[3914.30 --> 3915.30]  I thought it'd be funny.
[3915.30 --> 3920.30]  Like, like what actually goes into making a pair of $55,000 freaking dollar headphones.
[3920.30 --> 3921.30]  A lot I would imagine.
[3921.30 --> 3922.30]  Yeah.
[3922.30 --> 3924.30]  I also suspect the profit margin is fairly sufficient.
[3924.30 --> 3928.30]  But I want to solve the section of I would imagine.
[3928.30 --> 3935.30]  Alright, so this article here is from Android Authority.
[3935.30 --> 3940.30]  Beware of cheap USB type C cables, warns Google engineer.
[3940.30 --> 3941.30]  This is actually a very good point.
[3941.30 --> 3942.30]  Yeah.
[3942.30 --> 3945.30]  Especially early in the life cycle of a new cable standard.
[3945.30 --> 3952.30]  It is very common for the, now I'm not saying that everyone has to run out and buy $200 HDMI cables from Monster.
[3952.30 --> 3958.30]  But you also shouldn't necessarily be buying $199 HDMI cables off the back of a truck.
[3958.30 --> 3959.30]  There is a middle ground.
[3959.30 --> 3966.30]  And so buying a low quality cable, particularly very early in the life cycle of a connector, can lead to issues.
[3966.30 --> 3970.30]  Because they might not undergo the appropriate tests and validation.
[3970.30 --> 3971.30]  Depends whose truck.
[3971.30 --> 3972.30]  Depends whose truck.
[3972.30 --> 3976.30]  So Google engineer Benson Leung has been testing cheap USB type C.
[3976.30 --> 3985.30]  Can you imagine someone at Google just being like, you know, so I'd like for my next assignment to be buying a bunch of cheap USB type C cables and testing them.
[3985.30 --> 3991.30]  And like someone whose job it is to kind of go, yeah, okay, I guess that seems like a good use of your time.
[3991.30 --> 3992.30]  So.
[3992.30 --> 3995.30]  They all have self-guided time, don't they?
[3995.30 --> 3996.30]  Yeah, they do.
[3996.30 --> 3997.30]  So he might have just.
[3997.30 --> 4003.30]  An important feature with USB type C and 3.1 is support for 3 amp charging.
[4003.30 --> 4009.30]  And a number of the budget cables fail to match the standard specifications, which can be dangerous to your hardware.
[4009.30 --> 4014.30]  As legacy devices may not be able to handle charger currents when using adapter cables.
[4014.30 --> 4020.30]  So basically what he found was that some of the cheap type C cables were not suitable for his Chromebook Pixel laptop.
[4020.30 --> 4024.30]  It's amazing how many people at Google use MacBooks.
[4024.30 --> 4032.30]  Like, I was just like, shouldn't you guys be like trying to somewhat practice what you preach around here?
[4032.30 --> 4033.30]  No.
[4033.30 --> 4035.30]  Can you program on Pixel?
[4035.30 --> 4036.30]  At all.
[4036.30 --> 4044.30]  Uh, I'm sure someone out there is going to tell us that, yes, indeed, if you tap into the underlying Linux, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4044.30 --> 4045.30]  That's fine, but.
[4045.30 --> 4048.30]  But like naturally without fighting it.
[4048.30 --> 4049.30]  I don't think so.
[4049.30 --> 4051.30]  Like I've actually never used a Chromebook.
[4051.30 --> 4053.30]  I don't know how locked down they are.
[4053.30 --> 4055.30]  I am not even remotely interested in Chromebooks.
[4055.30 --> 4057.30]  Um, they are somewhat locked down.
[4057.30 --> 4058.30]  They're okay.
[4058.30 --> 4060.30]  Anything you can do in a browser you can do in a Chromebook.
[4060.30 --> 4062.30]  Anything else I would, meh.
[4062.30 --> 4066.30]  So yeah, there's a fairly obvious reason why probably almost none of them have Chromebooks.
[4066.30 --> 4070.30]  Um, The Witcher is getting a movie adaptation.
[4070.30 --> 4072.30]  Coding.com, I didn't mean stuff like that.
[4072.30 --> 4074.30]  WUGH!
[4074.30 --> 4075.30]  Anyways, continue.
[4075.30 --> 4076.30]  You know, it's so funny.
[4076.30 --> 4077.30]  Okay.
[4077.30 --> 4084.30]  So everyone watching the WAN show gets to be all like hoity-toity privy to this before they watch the video.
[4084.30 --> 4089.30]  Because I am going to be doing my Steam Machine video next week.
[4089.30 --> 4091.30]  So I've got an Alienware Steam Machine.
[4091.30 --> 4092.30]  Actually I had two Steam Machines.
[4092.30 --> 4093.30]  One of which I sent back.
[4093.30 --> 4097.30]  Because one video was enough for me to say everything I have to say about SteamOS.
[4097.30 --> 4101.30]  Um, I wasn't going to reveal that much.
[4101.30 --> 4106.30]  But, what I will say is this.
[4106.30 --> 4111.30]  Many of my complaints about SteamOS, I express.
[4111.30 --> 4119.30]  And then later on in the video, I burn all the Linux geeks.
[4119.30 --> 4121.30]  And I say that in like a kind way.
[4121.30 --> 4122.30]  Like, I'm a geek.
[4122.30 --> 4123.30]  You're a geek.
[4123.30 --> 4124.30]  We're all geeks.
[4124.30 --> 4126.30]  You could specifically be a Linux geek.
[4126.30 --> 4128.30]  I would specifically be, I don't know.
[4128.30 --> 4129.30]  I'm sure.
[4129.30 --> 4131.30]  But I could fall into a lot of categories, I'm sure.
[4131.30 --> 4138.30]  Um, so I kind of burn the Linux geeks that I predict with my amazing powers of future prediction.
[4138.30 --> 4139.30]  A little hammer drop.
[4139.30 --> 4144.30]  Are leaping down my throat when I talk about the limitations of SteamOS.
[4144.30 --> 4147.30]  And telling me all about how I can enable desktop mode.
[4147.30 --> 4149.30]  And I can install this and do that.
[4149.30 --> 4152.30]  And then sudo that and all this stuff.
[4152.30 --> 4153.30]  Sudo.
[4153.30 --> 4154.30]  Oh.
[4154.30 --> 4155.30]  Okay.
[4155.30 --> 4156.30]  Oh.
[4156.30 --> 4158.30]  So later on in the video, I'm like,
[4158.30 --> 4159.30]  Yo.
[4159.30 --> 4160.30]  I know.
[4160.30 --> 4162.30]  That doesn't matter.
[4162.30 --> 4163.30]  Because.
[4163.30 --> 4165.30]  So, you guys.
[4165.30 --> 4172.30]  I have saved you the embarrassment of typing a comment under that video and getting destroyed.
[4172.30 --> 4176.30]  Because there's a very good reason why that stuff doesn't matter.
[4176.30 --> 4179.30]  My Steam Machine video is gonna be really long.
[4179.30 --> 4181.30]  It's not sudo.
[4181.30 --> 4183.30]  I looked it up.
[4183.30 --> 4185.30]  It's sudo, you pronounce it sudo?
[4185.30 --> 4186.30]  Yeah.
[4186.30 --> 4187.30]  What?
[4187.30 --> 4188.30]  I know it's spelled sudo.
[4188.30 --> 4189.30]  Okay.
[4189.30 --> 4190.30]  Yeah.
[4190.30 --> 4193.30]  I actually looked it up because I was like, I need to make sure I don't say this wrong.
[4193.30 --> 4195.30]  Who says sudo?
[4195.30 --> 4196.30]  I don't know.
[4196.30 --> 4199.30]  That's interesting.
[4199.30 --> 4200.30]  Yeah.
[4200.30 --> 4201.30]  No, I.
[4201.30 --> 4203.30]  You talk to an obscene amount of Linux nerds who also says sudo.
[4203.30 --> 4204.30]  I know.
[4204.30 --> 4205.30]  I know.
[4205.30 --> 4206.30]  I know.
[4206.30 --> 4208.30]  And I assumed it was, I've only heard sudo before as well.
[4208.30 --> 4209.30]  Is that like gif and jif?
[4209.30 --> 4211.30]  Or is there actually a reason why it's?
[4211.30 --> 4216.30]  I will look it up because I, unless someone was trolling the crap out of me.
[4216.30 --> 4218.30]  How do you pronounce?
[4218.30 --> 4221.30]  I know it's super admin do, but like.
[4221.30 --> 4226.30]  Oh, this one says, I've heard it said sudo across the board.
[4226.30 --> 4227.30]  Okay.
[4227.30 --> 4228.30]  Um.
[4228.30 --> 4230.30]  But this guy, okay.
[4230.30 --> 4231.30]  So the OP here.
[4231.30 --> 4232.30]  Here you go.
[4232.30 --> 4233.30]  This is where the confusion comes in.
[4233.30 --> 4236.30]  OP says, I'm just learning to use Linux.
[4236.30 --> 4241.30]  And while I've seen that the official way is sudo, I still want to pronounce sudo.
[4241.30 --> 4244.30]  So which one do you use when talking about the command?
[4244.30 --> 4245.30]  Cause like.
[4245.30 --> 4246.30]  So there you go.
[4246.30 --> 4247.30]  No one's wrong.
[4247.30 --> 4249.30]  I know what super user do, but like look at the word.
[4249.30 --> 4253.30]  But it is way safer for me to say it the official right way.
[4253.30 --> 4254.30]  Yeah.
[4254.30 --> 4258.30]  So that those people can be double wrecked when they realize that they actually aren't pronouncing it right.
[4258.30 --> 4260.30]  Cause sudo sounds so dumb.
[4260.30 --> 4262.30]  I don't, I, I, yeah, that's not my problem.
[4262.30 --> 4267.30]  Um, so anyway, my steam machine video is going to be quite long, probably about 16 minutes.
[4267.30 --> 4274.30]  And, um, I'm not going to ruin the conclusion, but it's, it's still in beta.
[4274.30 --> 4282.30]  And it's, yeah, it's been in beta for, well, it hasn't been in beta for two years, but it's been in.
[4282.30 --> 4287.30]  Is there anything that it does that a normal installation of Linux cannot do?
[4287.30 --> 4290.30]  Uh, the video is, it's a really good video.
[4290.30 --> 4292.30]  It's a really well written video.
[4292.30 --> 4293.30]  It contains a lot of information.
[4293.30 --> 4296.30]  I would like you guys to watch it, so I'm not going to get too far into it.
[4296.30 --> 4298.30]  But, uh, I have saved you.
[4298.30 --> 4303.30]  I have saved you the embarrassment of pointing out to me things that I do indeed already know.
[4303.30 --> 4305.30]  Not that people seem to care.
[4305.30 --> 4314.30]  No one seems to care when they say something that it turns out that I already, in fact, oftentimes, the top rated comment on one of my videos would be like, Linus, didn't you realize?
[4314.30 --> 4321.30]  And then, like, the, like, couple of upvotes comment that's next under it is like, he said it right in the video.
[4321.30 --> 4323.30]  And no one, no one cares.
[4323.30 --> 4325.30]  No one watches the video as far as I can tell.
[4325.30 --> 4329.30]  I know it's Super User Do. Oh God.
[4329.30 --> 4332.30]  Are people telling you that it's Super User Do?
[4332.30 --> 4336.30]  I know, but like, and the thing is, they're going like, literally everyone.
[4336.30 --> 4338.30]  They're like, literally everyone says sudo.
[4338.30 --> 4340.30]  And I'm like, I've...
[4340.30 --> 4341.30]  Literally actually not.
[4341.30 --> 4343.30]  Heard that, like, twice.
[4343.30 --> 4345.30]  Yeah, literally not.
[4345.30 --> 4347.30]  Super everyone.
[4347.30 --> 4348.30]  Do's that.
[4348.30 --> 4349.30]  Oh, dude.
[4349.30 --> 4350.30]  Oh no.
[4350.30 --> 4354.30]  Alright, jetpacks, my friends.
[4354.30 --> 4356.30]  Yes, my friends.
[4356.30 --> 4358.30]  I thought we were doing a show on the business.
[4358.30 --> 4361.30]  Oh, yeah, well, oh my gosh.
[4361.30 --> 4363.30]  There's still like three pages of topics?
[4363.30 --> 4365.30]  How the crap did this happen?
[4365.30 --> 4367.30]  I think they're adding some while we're doing a show.
[4367.30 --> 4369.30]  No, no, these were all here, actually.
[4369.30 --> 4370.30]  I just...
[4370.30 --> 4371.30]  No, let's do the jetpacks topic.
[4371.30 --> 4373.30]  Come on, I want to do the jetpacks topic.
[4373.30 --> 4374.30]  Hey, it's cool.
[4374.30 --> 4375.30]  Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[4375.30 --> 4377.30]  Jetpack test flight!
[4377.30 --> 4380.30]  Wait, skip to later on in the video to see it actually take off.
[4380.30 --> 4381.30]  Like so many...
[4381.30 --> 4382.30]  Oh, no, never mind.
[4382.30 --> 4383.30]  This isn't the...
[4383.30 --> 4384.30]  This is another water one?
[4384.30 --> 4385.30]  No, no, no, no, no.
[4385.30 --> 4386.30]  This is a thing.
[4386.30 --> 4387.30]  Oh, wow.
[4387.30 --> 4388.30]  This is like, this is a thing.
[4388.30 --> 4389.30]  Whoa.
[4389.30 --> 4390.30]  Yeah, no, this is straight up a thing.
[4390.30 --> 4392.30]  This is not a hovercraft.
[4392.30 --> 4393.30]  Whoa.
[4393.30 --> 4396.30]  So he's just going over water for like safety, probably.
[4396.30 --> 4397.30]  Yes.
[4397.30 --> 4399.30]  Oh, no, no, no, they've got other videos.
[4399.30 --> 4402.30]  They've got like test flights in their facility that are not over water.
[4402.30 --> 4403.30]  Whoa.
[4403.30 --> 4406.30]  Yeah, so they got some help from the city of New York.
[4406.30 --> 4407.30]  This is a thing.
[4407.30 --> 4409.30]  Jetpack aviation.
[4409.30 --> 4410.30]  Check this out.
[4410.30 --> 4411.30]  I'm not telling you to order one.
[4411.30 --> 4414.30]  Not that you can because this is a prototype.
[4414.30 --> 4421.30]  But these guys have apparently been working for 40 years quietly on an actual jetpack.
[4421.30 --> 4426.30]  To be clear, it is not the same thing as a rocket belt.
[4426.30 --> 4431.30]  A rocket belt is just like burning some fuel and like shooting it out pretty much.
[4431.30 --> 4432.30]  No, no.
[4432.30 --> 4443.30]  This actually uses jet engines and carries its own self-contained fuel and is light enough for a person to wear and is like some super BA looking stuff.
[4443.30 --> 4444.30]  I forget what it's called.
[4444.30 --> 4446.30]  The something something nine.
[4446.30 --> 4447.30]  The JB09.
[4447.30 --> 4448.30]  I think they screwed up.
[4448.30 --> 4449.30]  I think they meant JP09 or nine.
[4449.30 --> 4450.30]  There's no zero.
[4450.30 --> 4451.30]  Don't worry.
[4451.30 --> 4452.30]  I screwed up too.
[4452.30 --> 4453.30]  I'm kidding.
[4453.30 --> 4454.30]  I don't mean they screwed up.
[4454.30 --> 4455.30]  No, no, it's called the JB9.
[4455.30 --> 4456.30]  Is it like Justin Bieber 2009?
[4456.30 --> 4457.30]  Yes.
[4457.30 --> 4458.30]  Yes, it is.
[4458.30 --> 4459.30]  Thank you.
[4459.30 --> 4463.30]  He should fly into one of his concerts like that and then slip on some water and get sad and leave.
[4463.30 --> 4464.30]  So their site is great.
[4464.30 --> 4465.30]  I tooled around on it for a little while.
[4465.30 --> 4472.30]  They've got lots of great information about the challenges that they faced, how they've overcome them because there's so many concerns.
[4472.30 --> 4477.30]  Like I always just assumed, you know, non mechanical engineer that I am, that jetpacks would always be impossible because we would never be able to control the exhaust temperature.
[4477.30 --> 4488.30]  So I always just assumed, you know, non mechanical engineer that I am, that jetpacks would always be impossible because we would never be able to control the exhaust temperature.
[4488.30 --> 4493.30]  So how do you keep people from burning their legs off when they're flying them?
[4493.30 --> 4496.30]  And not a thing.
[4496.30 --> 4500.30]  They have figured it out and it is looking pretty cool.
[4500.30 --> 4503.30]  So they're still working on a lot of R&D stuff.
[4503.30 --> 4511.30]  Ballistic parachute, a four engine version, a simulator to reduce pilot training time, improvements to the engines and computerized management systems.
[4511.30 --> 4513.30]  But this is some cool stuff.
[4513.30 --> 4516.30]  Hey, hoverboards may never happen, but jetpacks.
[4516.30 --> 4518.30]  Like, wow.
[4518.30 --> 4525.30]  You saw how aggressively angry different organizations got about drones.
[4525.30 --> 4528.30]  How upset are people going to be about jetpacks?
[4528.30 --> 4530.30]  I don't know.
[4530.30 --> 4532.30]  I so want to commute on one though, man.
[4532.30 --> 4536.30]  Like, yeah, but like what's going to happen the first time like a person runs into a plane?
[4536.30 --> 4537.30]  They'll die.
[4537.30 --> 4539.30]  And then what?
[4539.30 --> 4540.30]  I mean like politically.
[4540.30 --> 4542.30]  Oh, I don't know.
[4542.30 --> 4548.30]  I have a feeling these will never be unregulated though in the way that drones work.
[4548.30 --> 4549.30]  Yeah.
[4549.30 --> 4550.30]  Yeah.
[4550.30 --> 4551.30]  Yeah.
[4551.30 --> 4552.30]  You're going to have to do a flight time and like.
[4552.30 --> 4553.30]  I don't know.
[4553.30 --> 4554.30]  I would, what I would imagine.
[4554.30 --> 4556.30]  Maybe that's a radio to control powers and stuff.
[4556.30 --> 4557.30]  No, because.
[4557.30 --> 4559.30]  Like I don't think you can go that high, but you're still a risk for takeoff.
[4559.30 --> 4561.30]  No, radio is some 60s technology.
[4561.30 --> 4564.30]  The way that I imagine this working is you would have.
[4564.30 --> 4565.30]  They still totally use that.
[4565.30 --> 4568.30]  I know they do, but I, what I, no, I know.
[4568.30 --> 4572.30]  But my point is that that would not work for this.
[4572.30 --> 4573.30]  We need a new system.
[4573.30 --> 4579.30]  So the way that it would have to work is you would have to use individual GPS.
[4579.30 --> 4581.30]  You'd have to have individual GPS trackers on everyone.
[4581.30 --> 4586.30]  Everyone would have to have a data link, like a super fail redundant data link.
[4586.30 --> 4591.30]  And then you would still probably have to like, it could even be like app managed.
[4591.30 --> 4593.30]  So you'd be like, I'm leaving.
[4593.30 --> 4595.30]  This is my destination.
[4595.30 --> 4597.30]  You put your phone in your pocket.
[4597.30 --> 4600.30]  Your phone detects that you just fricking took off the ground.
[4600.30 --> 4602.30]  And then your jet pack reports in your status.
[4602.30 --> 4603.30]  It knows where you're going.
[4603.30 --> 4605.30]  You need a way for in air communication though.
[4605.30 --> 4607.30]  So you'd have, well you could have, okay.
[4607.30 --> 4609.30]  That, that could be radio.
[4609.30 --> 4610.30]  That could be whatever.
[4610.30 --> 4611.30]  Okay.
[4611.30 --> 4615.30]  But the way that the actual tracking system would have to work would almost have to be automated.
[4615.30 --> 4620.30]  So it would have to be like, you would have to, everyone would have to still have a headset.
[4620.30 --> 4632.30]  And then you'd have to have, instead of having like an air traffic control tower, everyone would have to intelligently from the mass management system, get the relevant alerts for them.
[4632.30 --> 4636.30]  But what stops someone from just not using a GPS device?
[4636.30 --> 4637.30]  Uh, the thing that stops them.
[4637.30 --> 4640.30]  Because air traffic towers can detect, well okay.
[4640.30 --> 4642.30]  Agencies that control the air.
[4642.30 --> 4643.30]  Yes.
[4643.30 --> 4645.30]  Can detect planes, even if they're not reporting.
[4645.30 --> 4646.30]  Yes.
[4646.30 --> 4655.30]  So the thing that would prevent people from doing that would be the interceptor police enforcement jet packs that show up on them and tell them to get the crap back on their flight path.
[4655.30 --> 4660.30]  So you could, so I mean, that's the way that I really see it being done.
[4660.30 --> 4664.30]  Like what prevents people from taking a car and driving it into a building?
[4664.30 --> 4665.30]  Technically nothing.
[4665.30 --> 4668.30]  Except that that's going to get you in an awful lot of trouble.
[4668.30 --> 4672.30]  So that's, that's really the way that I see this being regulated.
[4672.30 --> 4673.30]  Flight limit.
[4673.30 --> 4674.30]  Yeah.
[4674.30 --> 4682.30]  Like someone in chat just said a flight limit, but there's problems with that because like, since when have you not been able to take a limiting chip out of a car?
[4682.30 --> 4686.30]  Yeah, but we're not talking about limiting chips.
[4686.30 --> 4690.30]  We're talking about law enforcement laying the smack down on you.
[4690.30 --> 4698.30]  So, so yeah, I mean, there's a, there's a lot of different, there's people are saying jet pack way too slow.
[4698.30 --> 4706.30]  You got no idea what's up as the crow flies is pretty important in terms of how quickly you can get somewhere.
[4706.30 --> 4709.30]  Like no traffic lights is pretty darn important.
[4709.30 --> 4721.30]  I could probably get to work faster from home to here flying, you know, 40 kilometers an hour on a jet pack versus flying, flying, flying down the highway at 80 kilometers an hour in my car.
[4721.30 --> 4725.30]  Like it makes a big difference and it would be way cooler.
[4725.30 --> 4726.30]  So.
[4726.30 --> 4728.30]  I see a lot of problems with your plan, but.
[4728.30 --> 4729.30]  Oh yeah.
[4729.30 --> 4731.30]  There's a lot of problems with my plan.
[4731.30 --> 4732.30]  Okay.
[4732.30 --> 4749.30]  But I know that, but my point is that the current plan of centralized monitoring and radio communication is not enough because it needs to be like a smart system where the individual operators can, can receive and transmit only the relevant broadcasts to themselves.
[4749.30 --> 4756.30]  So the centralized thing just has to manage who needs to communicate with each other and why.
[4756.30 --> 4762.30]  So I would know if someone's going to intercept me, but I don't need to know about all that other stuff.
[4762.30 --> 4764.30]  You don't just automatically hear everything.
[4764.30 --> 4765.30]  I know.
[4765.30 --> 4766.30]  Okay.
[4766.30 --> 4769.30]  But I also won't have a frigging console in front of me.
[4769.30 --> 4770.30]  Yeah.
[4770.30 --> 4771.30]  I won't have pretty much anything in front of me.
[4771.30 --> 4772.30]  I might have a HUD if I'm lucky.
[4772.30 --> 4773.30]  Yeah.
[4773.30 --> 4782.30]  So, so something has, something has to be, something has to be cloud managed and intelligent in the background to manage, to make sure that that stuff works.
[4782.30 --> 4783.30]  Okay.
[4783.30 --> 4786.30]  Anyways, after party thing?
[4786.30 --> 4787.30]  Yeah.
[4787.30 --> 4788.30]  All right.
[4788.30 --> 4789.30]  Peace, bros.
[4789.30 --> 4790.30]  Thanks for watching the Man Show.
[4790.30 --> 4796.30]  We are going to be doing the ultra wide festival after party thing where we go through some of the honorable mentions here.
[4796.30 --> 4801.30]  So, stay tuned my good friends and we will see you on the other side.
[4809.30 --> 4810.30]  Where is this guy?
[4810.30 --> 4811.30]  A HUD is pushing it with 200 more years.
[4811.30 --> 4812.30]  We have HUDs today.
[4812.30 --> 4813.30]  Yeah.
[4813.30 --> 4823.30]  There, we are.
[4823.30 --> 4827.30]  There is a baby wage對啊 while happens.
[4827.30 --> 4828.30]  There, we are really good friends.
[4828.30 --> 4828.96]  So, only these are reaching the clinic
[4829.06 --> 4834.30]  Here it is my buddy.
[4835.30 --> 4837.30]  Hey guys, I need you on the other side.
[4837.30 --> 4841.58]  Your time is questi
