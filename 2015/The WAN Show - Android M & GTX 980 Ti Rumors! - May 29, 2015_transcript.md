[0.00 --> 0.88]  Yes.
[1.76 --> 4.08]  And we're live in theory.
[4.60 --> 4.90]  Maybe.
[5.08 --> 8.84]  I will definitely check this time because we thought we were live last week.
[8.84 --> 9.20]  I was looking at that one too.
[9.20 --> 13.40]  And we straight up were not live at all.
[13.58 --> 17.44]  So let's go ahead and fire up Twitch here and make sure things...
[17.44 --> 21.50]  This laptop is full of your Scrapyard Wars crap.
[21.64 --> 24.26]  Oh, that's because I wasn't also looking at it.
[24.38 --> 26.20]  I was specifically looking at it.
[26.24 --> 28.10]  You were like, oh, I was also looking at...
[28.10 --> 28.74]  Yeah, no, I wasn't.
[28.74 --> 30.14]  This is the laptop you were using.
[30.28 --> 30.46]  Yeah.
[31.58 --> 32.76]  This is why I love you.
[32.88 --> 34.50]  Were you also looking at this graphics card?
[34.52 --> 34.78]  I was.
[35.14 --> 35.44]  Yeah?
[35.56 --> 36.22]  Are you sure?
[36.36 --> 36.58]  Yeah.
[36.80 --> 37.30]  Okay, how about...
[37.30 --> 38.64]  He wouldn't sell it to me for $20.
[39.40 --> 41.50]  $20 for a 460?
[42.18 --> 43.04]  You're an idiot.
[45.28 --> 50.78]  Or more specifically, the guy you were trying to buy it from is not an idiot.
[51.24 --> 54.06]  No, I think I said $25 and then he was like, no, $30.
[54.18 --> 55.80]  And I was like, I can't do it.
[55.80 --> 59.52]  $30 for a 460 is pretty good.
[59.88 --> 60.28]  I know.
[60.48 --> 62.04]  Like, that's just you being a jerk.
[62.04 --> 63.48]  Brandon was like, what could you even do with that?
[63.52 --> 65.18]  I was like, a lot, actually.
[65.82 --> 68.02]  You could fairly easily play Battlefield 3.
[68.34 --> 68.72]  Yeah.
[68.90 --> 69.50]  Yeah, totally.
[69.64 --> 69.84]  Yeah.
[69.96 --> 72.18]  No, 460 is not a terrible card.
[72.34 --> 72.48]  Yeah.
[72.72 --> 73.04]  All right.
[73.08 --> 75.10]  So we have quite a show for you guys.
[75.26 --> 80.80]  We do have topics, but we're probably also going to be teasing the crap out of...
[80.80 --> 81.64]  Scrapyard War.
[81.68 --> 82.62]  To the...
[82.62 --> 83.24]  To the...
[83.24 --> 83.92]  The Reckoning.
[84.12 --> 84.90]  The Scrappening.
[86.12 --> 86.48]  Scrappening.
[88.44 --> 90.00]  That's actually pretty funny.
[90.40 --> 91.68]  Okay, I'll be right back.
[91.76 --> 92.06]  Hold on.
[92.20 --> 93.26]  I don't think that was me.
[93.44 --> 94.52]  I can't take claim for that.
[94.62 --> 94.90]  Oh, okay.
[94.90 --> 96.02]  I think I read that on Twitter.
[96.14 --> 97.16]  That might have been Edsel or something.
[97.28 --> 97.38]  Okay, hold on, hold on.
[97.94 --> 99.52]  I think I stole that from someone.
[102.52 --> 103.32]  The Scrappening.
[104.54 --> 105.54]  Dun-dun-dun-dun.
[105.64 --> 106.50]  I don't know where he went.
[106.70 --> 108.14]  I guess I can do the call-outs.
[108.14 --> 111.98]  We've got Google I.O. happened, so they were showing us stuff like...
[111.98 --> 112.32]  Things.
[112.78 --> 113.64]  That we'll talk about later.
[114.46 --> 117.46]  Also, 980Ti is officially launching at Computex, potentially.
[117.94 --> 122.04]  And some Star Citizen's assets leaked and the internet went quite crazy.
[122.48 --> 127.44]  And 2K is teasing a new game that could potentially be a new Bioshock.
[127.96 --> 130.70]  Which is cool because I've been benching Bioshock for years.
[130.92 --> 131.44]  It's official.
[131.70 --> 133.28]  Scrapyard Wars 2, the Scrappening.
[133.42 --> 133.78]  Nice.
[133.88 --> 137.40]  I don't know whose idea it was, but I ripped that off hardcore.
[138.14 --> 139.62]  I don't...
[139.62 --> 141.22]  No one believes it's me, so it doesn't matter.
[142.50 --> 143.26]  What else we got?
[143.26 --> 145.60]  I read a bunch of those types of things on Twitter.
[146.04 --> 148.90]  So, I think I took it from someone, but I'm not sure.
[148.98 --> 149.84]  Are we ready to roll the intro?
[150.08 --> 150.46]  We are.
[151.06 --> 151.62]  Boop boop!
[152.06 --> 153.10]  Hey, it worked!
[153.42 --> 153.64]  Oh.
[154.30 --> 155.06]  Did you reinstall it?
[155.44 --> 156.10]  No, I didn't.
[156.36 --> 157.32]  I don't know why.
[157.48 --> 157.98]  It's magic.
[158.14 --> 159.04]  It's Christmas miracle!
[159.04 --> 162.14]  I love Christmas!
[163.14 --> 164.80]  This show is like my Christmas!
[166.04 --> 169.34]  Except my Christmas comes every Friday at 4.30pm!
[169.60 --> 174.18]  You know what's funny is people have finally stopped asking me what time the WAM show comes on.
[175.46 --> 176.62]  That's an interesting point.
[176.76 --> 176.98]  Yeah!
[177.18 --> 178.92]  I haven't had anyone ask me in forever.
[178.92 --> 187.06]  Our sponsors, Dollar Shave Club, Mass Drop, and Circle Alt.
[190.04 --> 190.64]  Squarespace.
[191.32 --> 191.68]  Right.
[192.52 --> 193.58]  I see what you did there.
[193.62 --> 194.72]  That was what I meant to say.
[194.84 --> 195.36]  But no.
[197.90 --> 198.82]  No, indeed.
[199.14 --> 199.90]  Rectangle shift.
[199.90 --> 202.96]  It's a rectangle.
[203.46 --> 203.98]  Oh!
[204.28 --> 204.54]  Oh!
[205.56 --> 206.74]  Oh, jeez.
[207.10 --> 209.46]  Guys, can you turn your speakers off?
[209.54 --> 211.46]  Why is this computer lagging so hardcore?
[212.02 --> 212.40]  I'm on it.
[212.42 --> 212.68]  I'm on it.
[212.72 --> 213.14]  Oh, okay.
[213.76 --> 217.78]  It has been quite the freaking week.
[217.78 --> 229.08]  So, Scrapyard Wars 2, the scrappening, was scheduled for the first two and a half days to be build-off,
[229.50 --> 235.24]  and then the rest of the third day to be the judging period.
[235.60 --> 235.82]  Okay?
[236.50 --> 241.00]  We ended up starting on Monday, because we realized we had some crap to do later in the week,
[241.08 --> 242.62]  which, by the way, never got done.
[242.62 --> 252.38]  Because it took the entire week, up until about 2 o'clock today, all day, every day, for Scrapyard Wars 2.
[252.46 --> 255.48]  I have no idea how many parts it'll be.
[255.90 --> 258.62]  The guidance I gave Ed on the editing side...
[258.62 --> 259.74]  Editing?
[260.12 --> 260.90]  Because he's Ed.
[261.24 --> 262.42]  I'm on fire today.
[262.90 --> 267.18]  The guidance I gave Ed on the editing side is I don't want episodes that are longer than...
[267.18 --> 269.84]  If I tell him 14 minutes, I'm going to end up with 16.
[270.70 --> 272.32]  And what I actually want is 15.
[272.62 --> 273.62]  So, like, this is...
[273.62 --> 273.78]  You said 13?
[274.58 --> 278.34]  Is this the way most employer-employee relationships work?
[278.98 --> 283.46]  I have to say what I want, knowing that I'm not going to get it, but I might get something closer to what I really...
[283.46 --> 284.30]  That's how we do it with you.
[286.60 --> 290.44]  If we want you somewhere at a certain time, we tell you about half an hour before we actually want you there.
[290.98 --> 291.30]  Right.
[291.40 --> 297.62]  If it's like, oh, Linus needs to be doing this at 4.30, we'll be like, hey, Linus, you have to be doing this at 4.00.
[298.00 --> 298.32]  Right.
[298.96 --> 299.60]  That makes sense.
[299.60 --> 303.02]  So, I have no idea how many parts it's going to be.
[303.14 --> 307.24]  It depends on how many amazing moments there are.
[307.32 --> 316.10]  And I can tell you, having not tagged along for his side, there's already enough amazing moments for a heck of a lot of video.
[316.32 --> 316.52]  Yeah.
[316.52 --> 320.10]  But, I have to say this now.
[320.32 --> 325.52]  If you guys don't appreciate it when we do stuff that's a little cringe...
[326.24 --> 327.50]  Don't watch it.
[327.52 --> 328.20]  Don't watch it.
[328.28 --> 328.54]  Yeah.
[329.16 --> 338.06]  Because it's going to be really entertaining content, but it's going to be do as we say, not as we do.
[338.26 --> 340.32]  Because there's a lot of not as we do.
[340.64 --> 341.80]  At least in my side.
[342.60 --> 344.46]  I'm trying to not spoil things.
[344.70 --> 344.94]  Yeah.
[345.28 --> 346.04]  My side, too.
[346.18 --> 348.08]  I mean, should we tell them the challenge?
[348.80 --> 353.40]  I mean, that only spoils the first, like, 20 seconds of the first part.
[354.56 --> 355.00]  Realistically.
[355.70 --> 356.54]  Totally up to you.
[356.92 --> 357.44]  What do you think?
[357.44 --> 366.46]  I'm conflicted, because it might make people not bother watch, but then it might also make people want to watch more.
[366.46 --> 368.16]  Oh, I think it'll make people want to watch.
[368.18 --> 368.80]  Then let's do it.
[368.90 --> 369.06]  Yeah.
[369.14 --> 369.34]  Okay.
[369.34 --> 373.96]  So, the first part is coming out on Vessel, Saturday night...
[373.96 --> 376.90]  Sorry, before you keep going, I'm getting, like, Phantom Chest Mic now.
[377.18 --> 378.24]  I'm still wearing mine.
[378.38 --> 378.88]  Oh, wow.
[379.26 --> 381.40]  Like, I can feel it, but it's not there.
[381.48 --> 384.12]  We've been wearing lav mics for the entire week.
[384.12 --> 384.46]  The whole week.
[384.46 --> 390.06]  Okay, so part one is coming out on Vessel, Saturday night, midnight Pacific.
[390.30 --> 393.90]  So, Sunday morning, like, the very...
[393.90 --> 397.90]  So, the border between Saturday and Sunday Pacific time.
[398.30 --> 403.08]  And the theme is, they have to be water-cooled.
[404.22 --> 404.96]  They may not...
[404.96 --> 405.72]  Well, okay, give the...
[405.72 --> 406.30]  Do you want to give...
[406.30 --> 407.62]  Maybe don't give the dollar break?
[407.62 --> 408.08]  Yeah, sure.
[408.14 --> 408.98]  We can save the budgets.
[408.98 --> 411.26]  They have to be liquid-cooled.
[411.68 --> 417.98]  They may not use any off-the-shelf PC liquid-cooling components.
[418.46 --> 420.28]  And I don't mean buying them at a store.
[420.80 --> 425.54]  I mean, you cannot use something that's intended for PC water-cooling.
[425.64 --> 429.50]  So, like, you couldn't mount a computer fan on a radiator,
[429.74 --> 432.16]  because then that's using that fan to cool the radiator.
[432.16 --> 437.12]  So, enjoy.
[438.20 --> 444.10]  Because, like, if you know what you know about how handy Luke and I are with tools,
[444.62 --> 445.56]  then you...
[445.56 --> 450.04]  And, like, there's questionable availability of certain tools as well.
[450.16 --> 450.78]  Yep, yep, yep.
[450.82 --> 454.28]  It wasn't clear going into the competition if we were allowed to buy tools,
[454.42 --> 456.74]  if that counted against our budget.
[456.74 --> 457.26]  Yeah.
[457.36 --> 460.14]  So, we definitely had some...
[460.14 --> 461.72]  We definitely had some things.
[462.66 --> 463.38]  So, yeah.
[463.52 --> 468.24]  That's coming out on Vessel, basically, in about 36 hours.
[468.60 --> 471.20]  And then coming out on YouTube the following week.
[471.36 --> 473.94]  And then the parts will be weekly releases.
[474.86 --> 476.42]  So, there will be no, like,
[476.74 --> 480.32]  oh, this series disappears after, you know, three parts.
[480.32 --> 481.22]  Like, home room water-cooling.
[481.24 --> 482.38]  Like, home room water-cooling.
[482.44 --> 483.52]  Yeah, so, every Saturday.
[483.94 --> 484.22]  Yep.
[484.22 --> 485.48]  It's shot.
[486.34 --> 487.18]  It's in editing.
[487.36 --> 488.68]  And I have a lot of people ask,
[488.96 --> 490.24]  why does it take a week in between?
[490.74 --> 492.42]  Because of editing.
[492.66 --> 493.72]  It takes a week to edit.
[493.88 --> 495.02]  We have all the footage.
[495.46 --> 497.60]  Ed sits for an entire week
[497.60 --> 500.48]  and does nothing but edit Scrapyard Wars.
[501.00 --> 502.80]  And that episode that you guys see
[502.80 --> 504.92]  is a week's worth of one person's work.
[505.18 --> 506.82]  And a lot of people don't understand
[506.82 --> 509.64]  how much work it is to edit something like Scrapyard Wars.
[509.64 --> 512.78]  Think about, like, almost eight hours of footage times two
[512.78 --> 515.28]  for one day of Scrapyard Wars.
[515.80 --> 518.58]  Just scrubbing through that footage alone,
[518.76 --> 520.86]  not even putting it together in an entertaining format,
[521.06 --> 522.40]  is going to take forever.
[522.80 --> 523.48]  Yes, sir.
[524.02 --> 526.34]  So, guys, stay tuned,
[526.46 --> 528.98]  because I am pretty excited about this one.
[529.02 --> 531.30]  If you enjoy the cringiness,
[531.48 --> 535.02]  if you enjoy just the sheer entertainment factor,
[535.02 --> 538.36]  honestly, we did stuff we knew was wrong.
[538.74 --> 539.02]  Oh, yeah.
[539.22 --> 540.42]  But we had to try.
[540.56 --> 542.26]  Time constraints, tool constraints.
[542.58 --> 543.72]  Scrapyard Wars constraints.
[543.72 --> 544.92]  Scrapyard Wars constraints.
[545.84 --> 546.98]  Financial constraints.
[548.16 --> 549.48]  We did a lot of stuff.
[549.72 --> 550.12]  All right.
[550.20 --> 555.54]  So our first actual topic today is Google I.O. is on.
[556.00 --> 558.28]  There's lots of exciting stuff going on.
[558.40 --> 562.48]  Alex Goes High has posted a mega thread for it.
[562.48 --> 564.44]  My computer's like full derp,
[564.58 --> 567.22]  so I'll post that link to the thing as soon as I can.
[567.30 --> 567.94]  It's okay.
[568.08 --> 569.34]  I will tell you what.
[569.68 --> 571.12]  I will grab that one here.
[571.12 --> 572.82]  I got it, because it takes them a while to catch up anyway.
[572.92 --> 573.14]  You sure?
[573.32 --> 573.48]  Yeah.
[573.78 --> 574.12]  I'm here.
[574.88 --> 575.80]  Then we'll press enter.
[576.12 --> 576.52]  Okay.
[577.54 --> 577.94]  Okay.
[578.18 --> 580.10]  So what do we got here?
[580.20 --> 582.88]  So he's updating it as things go.
[583.48 --> 585.20]  Google and Android is everywhere.
[585.44 --> 587.02]  Truly the only global overlords of Earth.
[587.04 --> 588.38]  You can tell this is a forum post
[588.38 --> 589.96]  and not an article on The Verge
[589.96 --> 591.66]  or something along those lines,
[591.66 --> 594.40]  although these are definitely some interesting stats here.
[595.32 --> 597.68]  Between Chrome, Android, and YouTube,
[598.36 --> 599.32]  they have each.
[599.44 --> 600.92]  So Search Chrome, Android, and YouTube
[600.92 --> 603.04]  each have one billion users.
[603.56 --> 606.44]  How do you have a user for Search?
[606.78 --> 607.34]  You could.
[607.46 --> 608.12]  I mean, it's Google.
[608.48 --> 609.78]  But you don't have to be logged in.
[609.78 --> 610.56]  What do they not know?
[612.18 --> 613.58]  Yeah, but it's Google.
[614.02 --> 616.48]  So are they counting, like, guests as users?
[617.28 --> 618.40]  Because that's weird.
[618.40 --> 620.82]  Well, they can probably tell.
[620.90 --> 622.98]  Because people's IPs will change cyclically
[622.98 --> 624.18]  and stuff like that.
[624.28 --> 625.02]  And they can probably...
[625.02 --> 626.04]  They can look at persistent login accounts
[626.04 --> 627.72]  and stuff the way they do targeted advertising.
[627.92 --> 628.12]  Yep.
[628.26 --> 630.86]  It's like if you're logged into Gmail on that thing.
[630.92 --> 633.16]  And if they have a billion Chrome users,
[633.82 --> 636.54]  then, like, probably those people will use Search.
[636.56 --> 638.36]  I'm not trying to say they have less than a billion.
[638.58 --> 638.86]  Right.
[638.94 --> 640.92]  I'm trying to say, like, how do you even quantify that?
[640.98 --> 642.58]  And they might have a lot more.
[643.04 --> 643.90]  Probably a lot more.
[643.96 --> 644.14]  Yeah.
[644.78 --> 646.78]  Gmail has over 900 million
[646.78 --> 648.28]  and is closing on a billion fast.
[648.34 --> 648.96]  With that said,
[649.00 --> 651.36]  I personally have, like, half a dozen Gmail accounts.
[651.68 --> 651.92]  I have a lot.
[652.32 --> 653.02]  I don't know.
[653.12 --> 653.68]  I actually...
[653.68 --> 654.28]  I recently...
[654.28 --> 656.48]  I'm doing the Gmail to my kids thing
[656.48 --> 658.00]  from, like, the Gmail commercial.
[658.00 --> 658.74]  So you are doing it?
[658.84 --> 659.08]  Yeah.
[659.22 --> 659.42]  Cool.
[659.42 --> 659.58]  Yeah.
[659.58 --> 661.04]  I wasn't doing it.
[661.30 --> 663.68]  And then when my second one was born
[663.68 --> 665.70]  and we were traveling in Asia,
[665.70 --> 668.88]  I realized that they were not going to remember
[668.88 --> 670.14]  anything about this trip.
[670.14 --> 671.34]  And I kind of went,
[671.60 --> 672.60]  well, they're not going to remember
[672.60 --> 674.30]  anything about most of their lives.
[674.56 --> 676.66]  And so I used to keep, like, a diary
[676.66 --> 677.88]  pretty much straight up.
[677.92 --> 679.72]  I had a diary through, like, most of high school.
[679.82 --> 680.52]  I called it a journal
[680.52 --> 682.04]  because I didn't want people to make fun of me.
[682.10 --> 683.02]  But let's face it.
[683.52 --> 684.16]  What's a journal?
[684.28 --> 684.78]  It's a diary.
[685.74 --> 686.38]  If you're mad enough,
[686.44 --> 687.48]  you can admit you have a diary.
[687.82 --> 689.60]  So I had a diary in high school.
[689.74 --> 690.84]  And so I was actually, like...
[690.84 --> 693.08]  This is why I asked to borrow the GoPro
[693.08 --> 694.08]  for when I go to Taiwan.
[694.38 --> 694.78]  Oh.
[694.98 --> 696.84]  Because when I came back from Europe,
[697.24 --> 697.88]  I had decided,
[697.88 --> 699.60]  okay, I'm going to start keeping a travel log.
[699.60 --> 700.16]  Yeah.
[700.16 --> 701.60]  Like, not a day-to-day journal
[701.60 --> 701.80]  for my whole life.
[701.80 --> 703.06]  Just call it a travel diary.
[703.42 --> 703.64]  Sure.
[703.74 --> 703.98]  Be a man.
[703.98 --> 704.58]  A travel diary.
[704.62 --> 704.94]  Be a man.
[705.32 --> 707.22]  I think they're legitimately called travel logs.
[709.86 --> 711.52]  Because if you only use it for the...
[711.52 --> 711.84]  I don't know.
[711.92 --> 712.58]  Sure, travel diary.
[712.66 --> 713.00]  I don't care.
[713.20 --> 713.92]  But I decided, like,
[713.94 --> 714.86]  I was going to do that.
[715.12 --> 717.02]  But now I think I'm just going to try
[717.02 --> 718.10]  to get everything on a GoPro.
[718.36 --> 718.62]  Right.
[718.68 --> 719.58]  And have a video version
[719.58 --> 720.42]  because I think that's cool.
[721.72 --> 723.68]  I don't have one yet at all.
[723.80 --> 724.70]  I never made one.
[725.18 --> 726.06]  Yeah, I don't know
[726.06 --> 726.68]  if I believe that.
[726.68 --> 729.02]  So, we're going to straw pull the crap
[729.02 --> 730.06]  out of this one, guys.
[730.66 --> 732.58]  Is turnip going to become our thing?
[732.66 --> 735.58]  Kids and ladies and gentlemen,
[736.20 --> 739.88]  does Luke Lafreniere have a diary?
[740.08 --> 741.32]  I never even acquired one.
[741.52 --> 742.90]  I decided to go with a GoPro.
[743.00 --> 744.14]  You know, the fact that you're just
[744.14 --> 745.60]  not man enough to admit it?
[747.84 --> 749.80]  4% of the voters say no.
[750.78 --> 752.28]  4% my main man.
[752.46 --> 752.98]  Well, 7.
[753.34 --> 753.70]  7.
[754.42 --> 755.78]  Yes is running away with it
[755.78 --> 758.16]  with turnip destroying the no vote.
[758.46 --> 759.56]  Is turnip our new thing?
[759.68 --> 761.66]  Turnip, we've always put in a random thing.
[761.72 --> 762.48]  Did I do turnip twice?
[762.70 --> 763.62]  You've done turnip twice in a row.
[763.68 --> 764.44]  Oh, I didn't mean to.
[764.52 --> 765.40]  And remember, we made turnip
[765.40 --> 766.60]  like a huge deal last time.
[766.64 --> 767.96]  No, turnips are just like...
[767.96 --> 768.98]  I remember I like looked it up
[768.98 --> 769.96]  and like showed a turnip
[769.96 --> 770.44]  to the camera.
[770.76 --> 771.54]  No, there was a book
[771.54 --> 773.52]  that I read as a kid
[773.52 --> 774.60]  that was, I think it's called
[774.60 --> 775.46]  Turnips for Supper
[775.46 --> 776.38]  or something like that.
[776.44 --> 777.60]  So, I always think of turnips
[777.60 --> 778.60]  because like...
[778.60 --> 779.28]  Because you read a book
[779.28 --> 779.90]  when you were a kid.
[780.08 --> 780.40]  See?
[780.40 --> 781.78]  That diary's working out for you.
[781.84 --> 782.72]  That's the kind of thing
[782.72 --> 783.54]  that I want.
[783.62 --> 785.82]  So, I want my kids to...
[785.82 --> 786.18]  Do you remember
[786.18 --> 787.14]  when they read a book
[787.14 --> 787.70]  about a turnip?
[787.72 --> 788.68]  No, that's not what I want.
[789.28 --> 790.76]  I want them to...
[790.76 --> 792.20]  I want them to know things
[792.20 --> 793.62]  that I can't really tell them
[793.62 --> 794.36]  when they're five.
[794.46 --> 794.70]  Yeah.
[795.00 --> 796.64]  But that they will understand later.
[796.64 --> 798.22]  And I think it'll mean more
[798.22 --> 800.50]  having like potentially a video
[800.50 --> 803.14]  and your words at the time
[803.14 --> 803.96]  attached to it
[803.96 --> 804.76]  instead of like...
[804.76 --> 804.94]  Yes.
[805.14 --> 806.02]  ...recalling the event.
[806.02 --> 807.52]  So, so I...
[807.52 --> 808.50]  And so every email
[808.50 --> 810.02]  I try to attach a couple pictures
[810.02 --> 811.80]  or a very short video clip.
[811.90 --> 812.06]  Yeah.
[812.16 --> 814.06]  And then I tell either stories
[814.06 --> 814.70]  about them
[814.70 --> 816.14]  or little things that they do
[816.14 --> 817.78]  or stories about what's going on
[817.78 --> 818.30]  in our lives
[818.30 --> 818.88]  because I figure
[818.88 --> 820.26]  one possibility
[820.26 --> 821.36]  although it's up to them
[821.36 --> 822.68]  is that we could read
[822.68 --> 823.32]  through them together
[823.32 --> 824.70]  or one possibility
[824.70 --> 825.40]  is that they'll sit
[825.40 --> 826.10]  and read them on their own.
[826.18 --> 826.56]  I don't know
[826.56 --> 827.18]  but I figure...
[827.18 --> 827.68]  And the thing is
[827.68 --> 828.96]  you could read through them together
[828.96 --> 829.88]  but then it could be
[829.88 --> 831.10]  a go-back resource
[831.10 --> 832.16]  for however long
[832.16 --> 832.88]  which they might read
[832.88 --> 833.44]  by themselves.
[834.56 --> 834.98]  Which is cool.
[834.98 --> 835.62]  Yeah.
[835.90 --> 836.72]  Or maybe their kids
[836.72 --> 837.16]  will read it.
[837.50 --> 838.04]  Yeah, or that.
[838.12 --> 839.52]  It's like a modern scrapbook.
[839.80 --> 840.02]  Yeah.
[840.46 --> 841.50]  So, so anyway
[841.50 --> 842.26]  I decided to do that.
[842.30 --> 842.98]  Anyway, the point was
[842.98 --> 844.50]  I have a lot of Gmail accounts
[844.50 --> 845.28]  because technically
[845.28 --> 846.94]  they can't own Gmail accounts
[846.94 --> 848.12]  even though Google's commercial
[848.12 --> 849.04]  suggested that...
[849.04 --> 849.86]  I have at least 20.
[850.00 --> 851.02]  ...that you can do this.
[852.06 --> 853.10]  And then when I tried
[853.10 --> 853.96]  to put in their birthday
[853.96 --> 855.26]  when I created the Gmail account
[855.26 --> 855.68]  it was like
[855.68 --> 856.50]  no you may not.
[857.34 --> 858.04]  Okay then.
[859.62 --> 860.76]  So over four...
[860.76 --> 863.00]  I think it's assumed
[863.00 --> 864.04]  that you have control
[864.04 --> 864.62]  of the account.
[864.98 --> 865.34]  Right.
[865.34 --> 866.14]  So I think Google was like
[866.14 --> 867.38]  well the parent will make it
[867.38 --> 868.06]  and it will be fine.
[869.14 --> 871.80]  So Android M preview.
[872.40 --> 873.60]  Six main new features.
[873.80 --> 875.12]  Hopefully one of them
[875.12 --> 877.12]  is better memory management.
[877.90 --> 879.52]  App permissions management.
[879.96 --> 881.22]  So you can actually manage
[881.22 --> 882.38]  each app's permissions
[882.38 --> 883.28]  individually
[883.28 --> 884.36]  and apps will request
[884.36 --> 885.70]  permissions when they need
[885.70 --> 886.80]  as opposed to
[886.80 --> 887.48]  on installation.
[887.72 --> 888.46]  That's an iOS thing.
[888.46 --> 889.44]  So that's...
[889.44 --> 890.40]  Oh it's nice to have it.
[890.56 --> 890.70]  Yeah.
[890.86 --> 891.46]  No I agree.
[891.56 --> 892.40]  I'm just saying that's
[892.40 --> 893.38]  an iOS thing.
[893.72 --> 894.26]  App links.
[894.42 --> 895.40]  So Android is smarter
[895.40 --> 896.22]  with web links now.
[896.32 --> 896.96]  Like a Twitter link
[896.96 --> 897.46]  on an email
[897.46 --> 898.64]  will immediately open Twitter
[898.64 --> 899.32]  instead of asking
[899.32 --> 899.90]  what to do with it
[899.90 --> 900.64]  every freaking time.
[900.98 --> 902.16]  And like the funniest thing
[902.16 --> 903.96]  is when it's like a tweet
[903.96 --> 905.46]  that contains a YouTube link
[905.46 --> 906.52]  and you click it
[906.52 --> 908.24]  and it like opens up Twitter
[908.24 --> 909.10]  and then it goes away
[909.10 --> 910.14]  and then it like opens up YouTube
[910.14 --> 910.72]  once you've already
[910.72 --> 911.40]  got your defaults.
[911.44 --> 913.14]  Like why are you doing this?
[913.72 --> 914.44]  Much better.
[914.88 --> 915.88]  Android Pay.
[916.84 --> 917.74]  Creatively named
[917.74 --> 920.44]  is the full replacement
[920.44 --> 921.82]  of Google Wallet.
[921.90 --> 922.86]  It uses NFC
[922.86 --> 924.34]  and host card emulation
[924.34 --> 925.46]  and Google says
[925.46 --> 926.34]  it's about simplicity,
[926.56 --> 927.92]  security and choice.
[928.30 --> 929.12]  Works with all four
[929.12 --> 930.26]  major credit card providers
[930.26 --> 930.96]  Visa, MasterCard,
[931.02 --> 931.46]  American Express
[931.46 --> 932.16]  and Discover
[932.16 --> 933.66]  and will come pre-installed
[933.66 --> 934.86]  on AT&T, Verizon
[934.86 --> 937.08]  and T-Mobile new devices.
[937.42 --> 938.16]  So they're going for
[938.16 --> 938.96]  pretty much
[938.96 --> 940.22]  widespread.
[941.08 --> 941.46]  I mean,
[941.98 --> 943.84]  what, Sprint remains?
[944.06 --> 945.54]  All the things, yeah.
[945.74 --> 947.12]  Who else is a major carrier
[947.12 --> 947.68]  in the States?
[949.54 --> 950.52]  Does Sprint piggyback
[950.52 --> 950.92]  off someone?
[951.32 --> 951.86]  No, no.
[951.94 --> 952.30]  Sprint is,
[952.42 --> 953.08]  Sprint's their own network.
[953.12 --> 953.76]  Okay, okay.
[954.02 --> 954.76]  I think that's like
[954.76 --> 955.48]  pretty much it.
[955.60 --> 955.78]  Yeah.
[955.90 --> 957.12]  So it'll work in...
[957.12 --> 958.08]  Does T-Mobile piggyback
[958.08 --> 958.54]  off people?
[958.64 --> 959.44]  No, they have their own network.
[959.52 --> 959.70]  Okay.
[959.70 --> 960.90]  So it'll work in
[960.90 --> 962.64]  700,000 stores
[962.64 --> 963.44]  in the US
[963.44 --> 964.10]  and also for purchasing
[964.10 --> 964.98]  blah, blah, blah, blah.
[965.00 --> 966.64]  Okay, is that 700,000
[966.64 --> 968.02]  like if it works
[968.02 --> 968.84]  in McDonald's,
[968.84 --> 969.46]  is that counting
[969.46 --> 970.26]  all the McDonald's
[970.26 --> 970.82]  that are getting it?
[971.76 --> 972.56]  I don't know.
[972.92 --> 973.80]  Because that could be
[973.80 --> 974.42]  like a couple
[974.42 --> 975.34]  really big chains.
[975.80 --> 976.86]  So Android Pay
[976.86 --> 977.64]  is not limited
[977.64 --> 978.70]  to Android M.
[979.00 --> 979.48]  However,
[980.36 --> 982.08]  NFC through
[982.08 --> 983.38]  fingerprint support
[983.38 --> 984.14]  is limited
[984.14 --> 985.04]  to M.
[985.04 --> 985.98]  Which I think is
[985.98 --> 987.08]  kind of...
[987.08 --> 987.78]  I would want that.
[987.98 --> 988.84]  I would straight up
[988.84 --> 989.16]  want that.
[989.22 --> 989.82]  With how good
[989.82 --> 990.68]  the fingerprint scanner
[990.68 --> 992.52]  is on the Galaxy S6,
[993.08 --> 994.04]  man, that's
[994.04 --> 995.46]  like freaking awesome.
[995.82 --> 996.74]  Like the...
[996.74 --> 997.96]  That access point,
[998.08 --> 998.78]  the video for which
[998.78 --> 999.42]  is coming out
[999.42 --> 1000.28]  on YouTube
[1000.28 --> 1000.94]  at some point.
[1001.08 --> 1001.88]  It's already up on Vessel.
[1001.88 --> 1002.20]  Is it a name?
[1002.50 --> 1003.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[1003.04 --> 1003.38]  X claim.
[1003.38 --> 1003.80]  X claim, yeah.
[1003.80 --> 1004.14]  Yeah.
[1004.14 --> 1005.62]  So it has
[1005.62 --> 1006.54]  app-based management
[1006.54 --> 1007.34]  and it supports
[1007.34 --> 1008.16]  signing in
[1008.16 --> 1009.36]  with your fingerprint
[1009.36 --> 1010.40]  on iOS
[1010.40 --> 1012.26]  but not on Android.
[1012.80 --> 1013.88]  Man, it's nice.
[1014.40 --> 1015.04]  Fire up the app,
[1015.16 --> 1015.78]  boot in.
[1015.94 --> 1016.24]  Done.
[1016.46 --> 1017.00]  Love it.
[1017.00 --> 1019.18]  Improved power management
[1019.18 --> 1020.68]  and hardware support.
[1021.20 --> 1021.84]  So...
[1021.84 --> 1023.72]  Power consumption
[1023.72 --> 1024.54]  on Android.
[1025.04 --> 1025.92]  Mainly with the
[1025.92 --> 1027.00]  introduction of Doze
[1027.00 --> 1027.78]  which is a new feature
[1027.78 --> 1028.18]  that will use
[1028.18 --> 1029.12]  the sensors on the device
[1029.12 --> 1030.18]  to kill background
[1030.18 --> 1030.72]  processes.
[1030.88 --> 1031.58]  Thank you!
[1032.96 --> 1035.44]  When in standby mode
[1035.44 --> 1036.02]  through alarms
[1036.02 --> 1036.72]  and priority surfaces
[1036.72 --> 1037.28]  will still be...
[1037.28 --> 1039.48]  So, alarms and priority stuff
[1039.48 --> 1040.28]  will still be active
[1040.28 --> 1041.76]  but something like
[1041.76 --> 1043.80]  I had a huge problem
[1043.80 --> 1044.98]  where...
[1044.98 --> 1045.64]  Bloody hell.
[1045.74 --> 1046.22]  What's it called?
[1046.30 --> 1046.70]  Plex.
[1047.00 --> 1049.30]  Was nuking my battery life.
[1049.64 --> 1050.94]  Like, I would fire up
[1050.94 --> 1052.34]  my phone from fresh
[1052.34 --> 1054.48]  and if I put it on my bed
[1054.48 --> 1056.32]  like my entire...
[1056.32 --> 1057.42]  Or like under a pillow
[1057.42 --> 1057.92]  or something
[1057.92 --> 1058.70]  and walked away from it
[1058.70 --> 1059.90]  leaving the screen off
[1059.90 --> 1060.38]  it'd be at like
[1060.38 --> 1061.20]  30% battery
[1061.20 --> 1061.86]  at the end of the day
[1061.86 --> 1062.96]  having done nothing.
[1063.30 --> 1064.26]  No screen time
[1064.26 --> 1065.16]  and like...
[1065.16 --> 1066.54]  It was like a toaster
[1066.54 --> 1067.80]  inside there.
[1067.96 --> 1069.28]  Like it was just churning.
[1069.50 --> 1070.30]  This thing is supposed
[1070.30 --> 1070.86]  to have what?
[1070.90 --> 1071.44]  A day and a half
[1071.44 --> 1072.26]  or two days of battery?
[1072.42 --> 1072.56]  Yeah.
[1072.90 --> 1074.88]  I get most of the day.
[1075.24 --> 1075.90]  Well, if you've got
[1075.90 --> 1076.30]  something installed
[1076.30 --> 1077.54]  that's nuking it
[1077.54 --> 1078.52]  and my wife too.
[1079.46 --> 1080.56]  Yvonne is running...
[1080.56 --> 1081.56]  I haven't tried to figure it out yet
[1081.56 --> 1082.32]  but I'm sure there is something.
[1082.32 --> 1083.42]  She's running a 1M8
[1083.42 --> 1084.60]  and she gets...
[1084.60 --> 1086.26]  Her battery dies at like 4.30.
[1086.92 --> 1087.90]  Like every day.
[1088.22 --> 1089.54]  Taren's just walking down the street
[1089.54 --> 1090.14]  wearing his helmet.
[1090.14 --> 1092.48]  Oh, he's getting his bike
[1092.48 --> 1093.06]  out of my car.
[1093.60 --> 1094.10]  Oh, okay.
[1094.22 --> 1094.80]  Yeah, don't worry.
[1094.98 --> 1095.46]  I was like,
[1095.54 --> 1096.28]  what the hell?
[1096.28 --> 1096.84]  No, no.
[1097.06 --> 1097.74]  He's okay.
[1098.04 --> 1099.00]  Everything is okay.
[1099.60 --> 1100.72]  Android M will include
[1100.72 --> 1101.52]  native support
[1101.52 --> 1103.20]  for USB Type-C.
[1103.90 --> 1105.26]  So that comes
[1105.26 --> 1106.32]  with some special features.
[1106.66 --> 1108.30]  So using your device
[1108.30 --> 1109.30]  to charge another device
[1109.30 --> 1109.74]  would be one
[1109.74 --> 1110.80]  because USB Type-C
[1110.80 --> 1111.66]  can both accept
[1111.66 --> 1113.32]  and output power.
[1113.82 --> 1115.18]  So that's pretty cool.
[1115.38 --> 1115.56]  Yeah.
[1115.56 --> 1117.04]  What else we got?
[1117.14 --> 1117.96]  New minor features
[1117.96 --> 1119.78]  including improved word selection,
[1119.98 --> 1120.64]  copy-paste
[1120.64 --> 1122.56]  and more independent volume controls
[1122.56 --> 1123.66]  for alarms, apps, and music.
[1123.90 --> 1124.72]  Thank you.
[1124.74 --> 1125.02]  That's cool.
[1125.38 --> 1125.92]  This is something
[1125.92 --> 1127.64]  that some skin makers do
[1127.64 --> 1128.82]  but others don't.
[1128.88 --> 1129.56]  It drives me crazy.
[1129.70 --> 1130.88]  I love the Droid Turbo
[1130.88 --> 1132.60]  but there are a couple of things
[1132.60 --> 1133.88]  that super duper
[1133.88 --> 1135.02]  make me mad about it
[1135.02 --> 1136.34]  and not having
[1136.34 --> 1137.74]  those individual volume sliders
[1137.74 --> 1138.58]  easily accessible
[1138.58 --> 1139.82]  is definitely
[1139.82 --> 1141.18]  one of them.
[1141.52 --> 1142.78]  I still don't think
[1142.78 --> 1143.56]  it's clear
[1143.56 --> 1145.06]  what Android M
[1145.06 --> 1146.30]  is going to stand for.
[1146.40 --> 1147.40]  I think one of the frontrunners
[1147.40 --> 1148.18]  is what, Marshmallow?
[1148.52 --> 1149.52]  That would make sense.
[1150.04 --> 1150.50]  The first thing
[1150.50 --> 1150.96]  that came to mind
[1150.96 --> 1151.80]  for me was Munchie.
[1152.12 --> 1153.14]  I figured M&M's.
[1153.84 --> 1154.78]  But that's just kind of
[1154.78 --> 1155.74]  awkward and long.
[1157.52 --> 1158.26]  That's amazing
[1158.26 --> 1158.94]  how quickly
[1158.94 --> 1160.76]  we're getting M
[1160.76 --> 1162.08]  over Lollipop.
[1162.36 --> 1163.48]  Lollipop was a very
[1163.48 --> 1164.20]  short-lived
[1164.20 --> 1165.44]  Android
[1165.44 --> 1166.84]  compared to Kit Kat.
[1166.84 --> 1166.98]  Which I'm okay with.
[1167.42 --> 1168.12]  I am totally
[1168.12 --> 1169.36]  100% okay with that.
[1169.36 --> 1170.24]  I was not a huge fan
[1170.24 --> 1170.80]  of Lollipop.
[1171.60 --> 1171.96]  Alright,
[1172.14 --> 1172.70]  so there's a bunch
[1172.70 --> 1173.38]  of other stuff.
[1173.52 --> 1174.14]  So there's more
[1174.14 --> 1175.68]  about Google Cardboard.
[1176.10 --> 1177.12]  So the new design
[1177.12 --> 1178.52]  fits 6-inch smartphones
[1178.52 --> 1179.32]  and the SDK
[1179.32 --> 1180.36]  also now supports
[1180.36 --> 1180.74]  iOS.
[1181.20 --> 1181.82]  And they talked about
[1181.82 --> 1182.24]  how they're going to
[1182.24 --> 1183.14]  start moving away
[1183.14 --> 1183.98]  from Cardboard.
[1184.54 --> 1184.80]  Yeah,
[1185.06 --> 1186.64]  that's good I guess.
[1186.80 --> 1187.06]  Yeah,
[1187.36 --> 1187.84]  that's actually
[1187.84 --> 1188.50]  quite interesting.
[1189.28 --> 1190.18]  Where even are
[1190.18 --> 1190.94]  these notes?
[1191.16 --> 1191.36]  Oh,
[1191.42 --> 1192.32]  they're just not in here.
[1192.40 --> 1192.60]  Yeah,
[1192.72 --> 1192.88]  oh,
[1192.92 --> 1193.42]  they're not in there.
[1193.42 --> 1194.54]  There's way too much.
[1194.64 --> 1195.64]  Google I.O.'s crazy.
[1195.78 --> 1196.44]  There's a bunch of stuff
[1196.44 --> 1197.32]  for Android Wear.
[1197.42 --> 1197.58]  I mean,
[1197.62 --> 1198.22]  they've continued
[1198.22 --> 1198.84]  to roll out
[1198.84 --> 1199.88]  Android Wear features.
[1199.88 --> 1201.10]  I'm looking at
[1201.10 --> 1201.78]  the actual dock
[1201.78 --> 1202.16]  and I'm like,
[1202.22 --> 1202.68]  I don't know
[1202.68 --> 1203.62]  where he's getting this stuff.
[1203.62 --> 1203.76]  No,
[1203.82 --> 1204.62]  there's nothing in there.
[1205.14 --> 1205.92]  So like,
[1205.98 --> 1206.46]  one example
[1206.46 --> 1207.78]  of a relatively new feature
[1207.78 --> 1208.80]  is you can flick
[1208.80 --> 1209.60]  and then scroll
[1209.60 --> 1210.20]  through things
[1210.20 --> 1210.96]  if you aren't able
[1210.96 --> 1212.38]  to scroll with your hand
[1212.38 --> 1213.18]  through your notifications.
[1213.18 --> 1215.84]  My G-Watch R charger replacement
[1215.84 --> 1217.22]  hasn't actually arrived yet
[1217.22 --> 1219.22]  but Ed has the G-Watch R as well
[1219.22 --> 1219.90]  and was telling me,
[1220.16 --> 1221.42]  I kind of laughed at him
[1221.42 --> 1222.24]  when he showed it to me.
[1222.28 --> 1222.66]  I was like,
[1223.26 --> 1223.82]  really?
[1223.92 --> 1225.12]  You're going to go like this
[1225.12 --> 1227.02]  and flick through things like that?
[1227.06 --> 1227.44]  He's like,
[1227.56 --> 1228.04]  actually,
[1228.14 --> 1228.70]  it's pretty handy.
[1228.84 --> 1229.70]  You're holding an umbrella
[1229.70 --> 1231.54]  or you're holding something
[1231.54 --> 1232.72]  and a notification comes in.
[1232.76 --> 1232.94]  Boop,
[1232.96 --> 1233.10]  boop,
[1233.14 --> 1233.52]  boop.
[1233.60 --> 1233.84]  Okay.
[1233.86 --> 1234.86]  Anyone other than you
[1234.86 --> 1235.94]  that's currently driving?
[1236.24 --> 1236.62]  All right.
[1236.68 --> 1236.84]  Yep,
[1236.92 --> 1237.42]  I buy it.
[1237.52 --> 1238.00]  I buy it.
[1238.80 --> 1239.20]  So,
[1239.48 --> 1241.14]  yeah,
[1241.16 --> 1241.78]  they've actually got
[1241.78 --> 1242.96]  a neat little chart here
[1242.96 --> 1243.90]  of Android Wear
[1243.90 --> 1244.90]  as it's continued to develop.
[1244.96 --> 1245.30]  It's funny
[1245.30 --> 1246.16]  because no matter
[1246.16 --> 1247.94]  how good Android Wear is,
[1248.54 --> 1249.90]  Apple has still sold
[1249.90 --> 1250.88]  more of like
[1250.88 --> 1252.46]  individual SKUs
[1252.46 --> 1253.90]  within the Apple Watch lineup
[1253.90 --> 1255.96]  as Android Wear devices total.
[1256.20 --> 1256.42]  Yeah.
[1256.64 --> 1257.06]  So,
[1257.12 --> 1257.20]  yeah,
[1257.24 --> 1257.64]  here you go.
[1257.70 --> 1258.50]  You can actually see.
[1258.62 --> 1258.72]  So,
[1258.82 --> 1259.80]  Wi-Fi came in,
[1259.86 --> 1261.14]  Always On Apps came in,
[1261.48 --> 1262.56]  new launcher happened,
[1262.70 --> 1263.80]  emoji recognizer,
[1263.94 --> 1264.52]  wrist gestures,
[1264.70 --> 1265.28]  maps API.
[1265.84 --> 1267.12]  Lots of stuff came in
[1267.12 --> 1267.64]  the May update
[1267.64 --> 1268.82]  that I haven't tried yet.
[1268.90 --> 1269.02]  So,
[1269.14 --> 1270.00]  I'm pretty excited
[1270.00 --> 1270.84]  to try that out
[1270.84 --> 1272.42]  as soon as my charger
[1272.42 --> 1273.02]  gets here.
[1273.82 --> 1274.88]  I guess that's probably
[1274.88 --> 1275.80]  enough Google I.O.
[1275.80 --> 1276.18]  for now.
[1276.30 --> 1276.96]  How much do you guys
[1276.96 --> 1277.80]  care about Google I.O.?
[1277.80 --> 1278.88]  I think we should revisit
[1278.88 --> 1280.18]  the Does Luke Have a Diary
[1280.18 --> 1280.70]  straw poll
[1280.70 --> 1282.08]  just to get a final tally here.
[1282.66 --> 1283.94]  56% of you figure
[1283.94 --> 1284.28]  yes,
[1284.36 --> 1284.66]  indeed,
[1284.76 --> 1285.66]  Luke does
[1285.66 --> 1286.50]  have
[1286.50 --> 1287.58]  a diary.
[1287.88 --> 1288.88]  Literally have no
[1288.88 --> 1289.70]  physical diary.
[1290.08 --> 1291.14]  Was going to do it,
[1291.22 --> 1292.10]  then thought of GoPro.
[1292.48 --> 1293.70]  Would have definitely done it.
[1294.38 --> 1295.36]  I think travel stuff
[1295.36 --> 1295.84]  is cool
[1295.84 --> 1296.84]  at the very least.
[1297.08 --> 1297.88]  Logging what you did
[1297.88 --> 1298.42]  in your travels
[1298.42 --> 1299.32]  I think is very cool.
[1299.32 --> 1300.56]  Mm-hmm.
[1300.72 --> 1301.14]  Mm-hmm.
[1301.34 --> 1301.74]  Okay.
[1302.04 --> 1302.66]  Do you still have
[1302.66 --> 1303.24]  your diaries?
[1303.48 --> 1303.88]  Yes, I do.
[1304.02 --> 1304.68]  Oh, that's kind of cool.
[1304.72 --> 1305.40]  Yeah, they're actually,
[1305.88 --> 1306.44]  they would be,
[1306.60 --> 1307.80]  unless I was dead
[1307.80 --> 1309.10]  and my house was being
[1309.10 --> 1309.76]  cleared out,
[1310.20 --> 1311.10]  you probably wouldn't
[1311.10 --> 1311.60]  find them.
[1311.84 --> 1312.90]  Because they're like,
[1313.20 --> 1314.22]  I mean, it's high school,
[1314.62 --> 1315.26]  so they're like,
[1315.46 --> 1316.36]  hyper embarrassing.
[1317.06 --> 1317.38]  Like,
[1317.92 --> 1318.70]  friggin' brutal.
[1319.34 --> 1319.90]  That makes sense.
[1320.06 --> 1320.22]  Yeah.
[1320.36 --> 1320.98]  There's like,
[1321.32 --> 1322.64]  there is stuff in there
[1322.64 --> 1323.70]  that just,
[1323.86 --> 1324.06]  no.
[1325.02 --> 1325.62]  That just,
[1325.72 --> 1325.82]  no.
[1325.90 --> 1326.60]  Were you like,
[1327.08 --> 1328.00]  no holds barred,
[1328.10 --> 1329.68]  just whatever's going on?
[1329.74 --> 1330.00]  Oh, yeah.
[1330.62 --> 1330.92]  Oh, yeah.
[1330.96 --> 1331.54]  I was like,
[1331.88 --> 1333.04]  because I never intended
[1333.04 --> 1334.12]  for anyone to read it,
[1334.30 --> 1336.16]  and I was super duper careful
[1336.16 --> 1337.96]  that no one ever read it.
[1338.28 --> 1339.32]  Because it's like,
[1339.48 --> 1340.30]  Has Yvonne read it?
[1340.42 --> 1340.76]  No.
[1341.22 --> 1341.50]  What?
[1342.86 --> 1343.56]  Oh, man.
[1343.70 --> 1344.48]  Are you kidding?
[1345.16 --> 1345.56]  Okay,
[1345.78 --> 1346.82]  I changed my mind.
[1347.02 --> 1348.38]  Luke doesn't have a diary,
[1348.70 --> 1349.54]  because if he did,
[1349.64 --> 1350.42]  he would understand
[1350.42 --> 1351.76]  that your wife doesn't read it.
[1352.24 --> 1352.46]  I,
[1352.56 --> 1354.26]  I actually don't.
[1354.26 --> 1355.34]  I would have definitely
[1355.34 --> 1356.72]  got a travel diary.
[1356.88 --> 1357.56]  I believe you.
[1357.78 --> 1358.02]  I believe you.
[1358.02 --> 1359.02]  I might even still log
[1359.02 --> 1359.60]  certain things
[1359.60 --> 1360.30]  if I don't get them
[1360.30 --> 1360.70]  on the GoPro.
[1360.72 --> 1361.38]  I'm shutting down
[1361.38 --> 1362.06]  that straw poll.
[1362.18 --> 1363.28]  Never gonna look at it again,
[1363.34 --> 1364.50]  because I believe you.
[1364.94 --> 1365.24]  Alright,
[1365.52 --> 1365.80]  so,
[1366.10 --> 1367.94]  WCCF Tech reports,
[1367.98 --> 1368.82]  I posted the link already,
[1369.18 --> 1372.50]  that the GTX 980 Ti
[1372.50 --> 1374.72]  will launch on June 2nd
[1374.72 --> 1376.36]  at Computex.
[1377.08 --> 1378.36]  Brings competitive
[1378.36 --> 1380.00]  graphics performance
[1380.00 --> 1381.20]  to GeForce?
[1381.20 --> 1384.48]  What?
[1384.48 --> 1384.72]  What?
[1387.56 --> 1388.30]  I didn't,
[1388.30 --> 1389.76]  I didn't even see that.
[1389.90 --> 1390.84]  I didn't even see
[1390.84 --> 1392.16]  that sub-headline.
[1392.80 --> 1393.10]  Like,
[1393.14 --> 1393.94]  are you for real?
[1395.04 --> 1395.56]  Anyway,
[1396.08 --> 1397.20]  WCCF Tech.
[1397.86 --> 1398.80]  They're gonna have
[1398.80 --> 1400.48]  an event on June 2nd.
[1400.54 --> 1401.68]  It is rumored to be
[1401.68 --> 1402.80]  a live stream
[1402.80 --> 1403.60]  where they are going
[1403.60 --> 1404.46]  to reveal it.
[1404.74 --> 1405.68]  This teaser
[1405.68 --> 1407.68]  pretty much says
[1407.68 --> 1408.56]  what it's gonna be.
[1408.94 --> 1410.22]  It'll be yet another card
[1410.22 --> 1411.80]  with that damn cooler on it,
[1411.92 --> 1413.24]  so Brandon's gonna have
[1413.24 --> 1414.06]  to figure out
[1414.06 --> 1416.04]  the world's most creative way
[1416.04 --> 1417.04]  to make yet another
[1417.04 --> 1418.10]  identical-looking
[1418.10 --> 1418.46]  NVIDIA card.
[1418.46 --> 1418.90]  He should, like,
[1419.00 --> 1419.92]  try to fly it around
[1419.92 --> 1421.08]  on a drone and stuff.
[1421.38 --> 1422.36]  He should just, like,
[1422.46 --> 1423.10]  I don't know.
[1423.42 --> 1424.02]  Like, we're gonna just
[1424.02 --> 1424.82]  have to start doing
[1424.82 --> 1426.12]  aerial footage of them
[1426.12 --> 1428.14]  to get a different shot
[1428.14 --> 1429.42]  from what we had before.
[1429.90 --> 1430.46]  You know,
[1430.54 --> 1431.20]  if they waited
[1431.20 --> 1431.92]  until we moved
[1431.92 --> 1433.06]  into our new office,
[1433.16 --> 1434.08]  we're getting a jib.
[1434.50 --> 1434.70]  Oh, wow.
[1434.70 --> 1435.18]  So we'd be able
[1435.18 --> 1435.76]  to do, like,
[1436.08 --> 1436.80]  jib shots.
[1438.88 --> 1439.28]  Now,
[1439.46 --> 1440.56]  slightly different
[1440.56 --> 1441.64]  shot
[1441.64 --> 1442.64]  of what looks
[1442.64 --> 1443.72]  exactly the same.
[1444.60 --> 1445.20]  It's funny,
[1445.30 --> 1445.96]  I was, um,
[1446.72 --> 1447.24]  because, I mean,
[1447.28 --> 1447.92]  they teased
[1447.92 --> 1448.82]  the graphics card, right?
[1448.84 --> 1449.04]  Can you tell
[1449.04 --> 1450.04]  if it's silver or black?
[1450.30 --> 1451.10]  Uh, it's silver.
[1451.52 --> 1452.06]  Can you tell?
[1452.22 --> 1452.38]  Yeah.
[1452.38 --> 1453.18]  Yeah, you can tell
[1453.18 --> 1453.52]  it's silver.
[1453.78 --> 1455.18]  So we were joking
[1455.18 --> 1455.72]  about this.
[1455.78 --> 1456.54]  We figured, hey,
[1456.72 --> 1457.58]  if we don't get
[1457.58 --> 1458.42]  a sample in time
[1458.42 --> 1459.04]  from NVIDIA,
[1459.18 --> 1459.96]  we can just do
[1459.96 --> 1460.72]  all our B-roll
[1460.72 --> 1462.20]  of another NVIDIA card.
[1462.88 --> 1463.40]  And then, like,
[1463.40 --> 1463.84]  whatever.
[1464.02 --> 1464.44]  We'll put, like,
[1464.46 --> 1465.20]  a text correction.
[1465.36 --> 1466.72]  Actually, the capacitors
[1466.72 --> 1467.26]  are in slightly
[1467.26 --> 1467.96]  different places.
[1468.14 --> 1468.88]  We got the real one
[1468.88 --> 1469.02]  now.
[1469.06 --> 1469.62]  It's a little different
[1469.62 --> 1470.20]  and we're going to
[1470.20 --> 1472.56]  like, straight up.
[1473.00 --> 1474.06]  Um, so,
[1474.36 --> 1474.82]  blah, blah, blah.
[1474.94 --> 1475.88]  It'll be the fastest
[1475.88 --> 1477.84]  GeForce 900 series card
[1477.84 --> 1479.16]  aside from the Titan X,
[1479.30 --> 1480.00]  which is technically
[1480.00 --> 1480.96]  not GeForce.
[1480.96 --> 1481.36]  I mean, it brings
[1481.36 --> 1482.94]  performance to GeForce.
[1483.14 --> 1483.28]  Is it GeForce?
[1483.36 --> 1483.62]  Yeah.
[1483.84 --> 1484.60]  So it's got to be
[1484.60 --> 1485.64]  the fastest one.
[1486.08 --> 1486.48]  Okay.
[1486.62 --> 1487.48]  Because it introduced
[1487.48 --> 1489.18]  performance to GeForce.
[1490.34 --> 1490.74]  Sure.
[1491.26 --> 1491.92]  And I don't know
[1491.92 --> 1492.52]  how they figure
[1492.52 --> 1493.54]  the Titan X sold
[1493.54 --> 1494.20]  more than the
[1494.20 --> 1494.88]  original Titan
[1494.88 --> 1497.20]  and even GTX 690.
[1498.60 --> 1500.38]  Um, maybe they mean
[1500.38 --> 1501.42]  in terms of price?
[1502.08 --> 1502.94]  Okay, whatever.
[1503.44 --> 1504.90]  Apparently, the, uh,
[1504.96 --> 1505.72]  the rumored
[1505.72 --> 1506.44]  specifications,
[1506.64 --> 1507.14]  so I'll go ahead
[1507.14 --> 1508.02]  and fire this up
[1508.02 --> 1508.56]  because I don't...
[1508.56 --> 1509.06]  I feel like the
[1509.06 --> 1509.88]  original Titan sold
[1509.88 --> 1510.26]  a lot.
[1510.88 --> 1512.14]  Yeah, because it was
[1512.14 --> 1513.62]  more useful as a,
[1513.62 --> 1514.28]  like, as a,
[1514.28 --> 1515.24]  as a double precision,
[1515.24 --> 1516.76]  like, card.
[1517.00 --> 1518.44]  The fact that the Titan X
[1518.44 --> 1519.68]  doesn't, has neutered
[1519.68 --> 1520.86]  double precision performance
[1520.86 --> 1522.06]  just like the GeForce
[1522.06 --> 1523.70]  cards really kills it
[1523.70 --> 1525.14]  for a lot of developers.
[1525.66 --> 1527.20]  Uh, the GTX 980i is
[1527.20 --> 1527.86]  apparently going to
[1527.86 --> 1529.38]  rock a GM200 core.
[1529.66 --> 1531.14]  It is a cut-down chip
[1531.14 --> 1533.20]  that features 2,816
[1533.20 --> 1534.14]  CUDA cores.
[1534.66 --> 1535.68]  Uh, blah, blah, blah,
[1535.78 --> 1536.08]  blah.
[1536.20 --> 1537.12]  The only site still
[1537.12 --> 1538.32]  reporting specifications
[1538.32 --> 1539.08]  aside from the one
[1539.08 --> 1539.98]  leaked by Harbor Ballad
[1539.98 --> 1540.60]  who have rumored
[1540.60 --> 1542.22]  3,072 cores.
[1542.90 --> 1543.88]  Uh, blah, blah, blah,
[1543.92 --> 1544.28]  blah, blah, blah,
[1544.36 --> 1544.90]  et cetera, et cetera,
[1544.96 --> 1545.28]  et cetera.
[1545.40 --> 1546.08]  Apparently, it'll have
[1546.08 --> 1548.60]  6 gigs of GDDR5 VRAM
[1548.60 --> 1549.72]  compared to 12 gigs
[1549.72 --> 1550.52]  on the Titan X.
[1550.64 --> 1551.52]  Which is probably fine.
[1551.58 --> 1552.76]  Which is probably,
[1553.00 --> 1554.40]  probably on the money
[1554.40 --> 1555.88]  compared to the, uh,
[1555.88 --> 1557.76]  if we look at GTX 780Ti
[1557.76 --> 1558.50]  versus Titan,
[1558.80 --> 1559.78]  which is the most
[1559.78 --> 1560.82]  similar comparison
[1560.82 --> 1561.58]  we can make
[1561.58 --> 1562.84]  because that's going
[1562.84 --> 1564.24]  to be the cut-down
[1564.24 --> 1566.50]  actually flagship core,
[1566.74 --> 1568.74]  whereas GTX, um,
[1568.82 --> 1571.24]  oh no, GTX 780
[1571.24 --> 1573.54]  was based on the same core.
[1573.54 --> 1574.30]  Yeah, but still,
[1574.46 --> 1575.30]  hmm, okay.
[1575.60 --> 1576.98]  Now, hold on just a second here.
[1577.00 --> 1577.52]  It was still 110, was it not?
[1577.66 --> 1578.82]  Yeah, no, 780Ti,
[1578.82 --> 1580.68]  so no, 780 to Titan
[1580.68 --> 1582.84]  is a more similar comparison
[1582.84 --> 1583.78]  to what the rumored
[1583.78 --> 1585.88]  980Ti is to Titan X.
[1586.44 --> 1588.16]  Uh, because 780Ti
[1588.16 --> 1590.06]  had all functional units enabled.
[1590.20 --> 1591.20]  It lacked double precision,
[1591.40 --> 1592.34]  but, and it didn't have
[1592.34 --> 1593.30]  a huge frame buffer.
[1593.42 --> 1593.60]  Yeah.
[1593.78 --> 1594.60]  But it actually had
[1594.60 --> 1595.60]  all the functional units.
[1596.06 --> 1597.08]  So, um,
[1598.12 --> 1600.24]  so 980 would be more similar
[1600.24 --> 1601.88]  to, like, a 770.
[1601.88 --> 1603.32]  So it's funny the way
[1603.32 --> 1604.00]  they do that,
[1604.58 --> 1605.40]  where they actually,
[1605.80 --> 1606.84]  like, they creep up
[1606.84 --> 1607.70]  the model number
[1607.70 --> 1610.18]  relative to what the actual
[1610.18 --> 1611.86]  under-the-hood hardware is.
[1612.00 --> 1613.46]  Which is super annoying.
[1613.70 --> 1614.38]  I wish they'd make
[1614.38 --> 1615.28]  our lives easier.
[1615.96 --> 1616.42]  Just be like,
[1616.46 --> 1617.50]  this is how it slots.
[1617.62 --> 1618.36]  Titan card.
[1618.70 --> 1620.28]  That is our top-tier GPU.
[1620.74 --> 1621.60]  It has everything,
[1621.72 --> 1622.78]  and a huge frame buffer,
[1622.94 --> 1623.94]  and double precision, maybe.
[1625.00 --> 1626.12]  Next step down
[1626.12 --> 1627.84]  is the cut-down one of that.
[1628.00 --> 1628.12]  Yeah.
[1628.12 --> 1629.28]  And even that's confusing,
[1629.28 --> 1630.20]  because the fact that
[1630.20 --> 1631.70]  a 980 and a 980 Ti
[1631.70 --> 1634.20]  are rumored to be based on
[1634.20 --> 1636.96]  completely different GPUs,
[1637.04 --> 1638.82]  same Maxwell architecture,
[1639.22 --> 1641.32]  completely different GPUs,
[1641.42 --> 1643.40]  is pretty irritating
[1643.40 --> 1645.02]  and pretty frustrating to me.
[1645.14 --> 1645.28]  It's weird.
[1645.76 --> 1647.06]  It should be like Titan
[1647.06 --> 1649.48]  and Titan Ti.
[1649.64 --> 1651.02]  They should have just called it
[1651.02 --> 1653.08]  970 and 960 Ti
[1653.08 --> 1654.06]  in the first place.
[1654.12 --> 1654.30]  Yeah.
[1654.30 --> 1657.02]  And released the rumored 960
[1657.02 --> 1658.40]  as a 960 then.
[1659.02 --> 1659.94]  Which, I mean,
[1660.02 --> 1661.40]  was rumored to be coming out
[1661.40 --> 1662.10]  ages ago
[1662.10 --> 1663.10]  and just straight up
[1663.10 --> 1663.80]  never happened.
[1664.36 --> 1666.06]  So, I don't know.
[1666.42 --> 1666.50]  How much...
[1666.50 --> 1667.08]  Sorry to the yawning,
[1667.20 --> 1668.70]  this week has been exhausting.
[1669.66 --> 1670.98]  Mainly from Scrapyard Wars.
[1671.46 --> 1672.38]  Yeah, it has been
[1672.38 --> 1673.72]  really, really, really tiring.
[1674.36 --> 1674.76]  Wait a minute.
[1675.12 --> 1676.74]  GTX 960 does exist?
[1677.42 --> 1678.40]  Did I just miss this?
[1679.68 --> 1680.70]  Hold on a second.
[1680.86 --> 1681.66]  When did that come out?
[1681.90 --> 1683.24]  Did I just completely derp?
[1683.24 --> 1684.98]  I think I sent you a card
[1684.98 --> 1686.00]  that I wanted us to review.
[1686.42 --> 1687.58]  A version of a 960.
[1687.86 --> 1688.72]  Did we never do one?
[1688.74 --> 1690.00]  It was the white and red one.
[1691.24 --> 1692.52]  No, this is like totally out.
[1692.56 --> 1693.28]  When did this happen?
[1694.22 --> 1695.28]  Did we do a video?
[1696.54 --> 1697.24]  April 28th?
[1699.24 --> 1700.00]  960 Strix.
[1700.34 --> 1701.32]  We covered this.
[1701.58 --> 1703.10]  We covered a few of these cards.
[1703.30 --> 1703.66]  Wow.
[1703.82 --> 1704.76]  And then I wanted you to do
[1704.76 --> 1705.54]  the white and red one
[1705.54 --> 1706.04]  for me to use.
[1706.04 --> 1706.58]  Well, whatever.
[1706.78 --> 1708.10]  My point still stands.
[1708.74 --> 1710.12]  960 could have come out later.
[1710.20 --> 1710.82]  Oh, that's right
[1710.82 --> 1711.38]  because it was rumored
[1711.38 --> 1712.12]  to come out right away.
[1712.22 --> 1712.46]  Wow.
[1712.46 --> 1714.36]  Guys, I am running on
[1714.36 --> 1715.50]  so little sleep.
[1715.72 --> 1718.20]  I even hosted
[1718.20 --> 1719.88]  one of those videos.
[1719.98 --> 1720.84]  I know for sure
[1720.84 --> 1721.82]  I hosted one of them.
[1722.20 --> 1723.34]  Oh, that's funny.
[1724.08 --> 1724.52]  Wow.
[1726.00 --> 1726.54]  This one.
[1726.70 --> 1727.60]  I sent you this
[1727.60 --> 1728.98]  and asked if we could review it.
[1729.06 --> 1729.36]  Right.
[1729.48 --> 1732.18]  The Asus white and red 960.
[1732.32 --> 1732.56]  All right.
[1732.62 --> 1733.44]  Well, whatever.
[1733.54 --> 1734.42]  My point still stands.
[1734.42 --> 1734.64]  It's turbo.
[1734.92 --> 1735.98]  Some consistency
[1735.98 --> 1737.28]  in the naming scheme
[1737.28 --> 1738.10]  with respect to
[1738.10 --> 1739.70]  what GPU is actually inside it
[1739.70 --> 1741.60]  would be super de-duper nice
[1741.60 --> 1741.94]  Nvidia.
[1742.98 --> 1744.20]  I guess that's pretty much
[1744.20 --> 1746.60]  all there is to say about it.
[1746.92 --> 1748.06]  3DMark Firestrike score
[1748.06 --> 1749.08]  is rumored to be around
[1749.08 --> 1751.00]  14,000 points
[1751.00 --> 1752.20]  which puts it
[1752.20 --> 1753.34]  within spitting distance
[1753.34 --> 1754.20]  of the Titan X
[1754.20 --> 1755.42]  and a lot higher
[1755.42 --> 1756.44]  than a GTX 980
[1756.44 --> 1757.04]  which is somewhere
[1757.04 --> 1758.20]  in the 11,000
[1758.20 --> 1759.88]  to 11,500 range.
[1759.88 --> 1762.50]  So, there you go guys.
[1762.68 --> 1763.42]  Once again
[1763.42 --> 1764.86]  or not even once again
[1764.86 --> 1765.38]  I don't remember
[1765.38 --> 1766.26]  a time they've done this.
[1766.56 --> 1767.66]  A TI card
[1767.66 --> 1768.58]  is like
[1768.58 --> 1769.92]  way better
[1769.92 --> 1770.96]  than the non-TI card
[1770.96 --> 1771.74]  whereas the TI
[1771.74 --> 1772.98]  was supposed to be like
[1772.98 --> 1774.60]  a little bit of a bump.
[1774.82 --> 1775.00]  Yeah.
[1775.20 --> 1776.10]  It's like pro.
[1776.72 --> 1777.38]  It's a little bit better
[1777.38 --> 1778.12]  build quality.
[1779.08 --> 1779.52]  And like
[1779.52 --> 1780.10]  faster
[1780.10 --> 1781.78]  but not that much faster.
[1781.90 --> 1782.50]  Don't worry about it.
[1782.92 --> 1783.44]  So yeah.
[1783.52 --> 1784.06]  Very interesting.
[1787.42 --> 1789.08]  My laptop's lagging you again.
[1789.08 --> 1790.10]  Yeah, that's fine.
[1790.22 --> 1791.24]  I'll go ahead
[1791.24 --> 1792.32]  and fire up the link here.
[1792.44 --> 1793.34]  Just the next one.
[1793.62 --> 1794.28]  No problem.
[1794.38 --> 1794.76]  I got it.
[1794.78 --> 1795.16]  I got it.
[1795.24 --> 1795.40]  So.
[1795.54 --> 1796.48]  You were able to share it
[1796.48 --> 1797.04]  before I was able
[1797.04 --> 1797.80]  to scroll through it.
[1798.32 --> 1798.68]  Volvo
[1798.68 --> 1802.80]  did a demo
[1802.80 --> 1805.32]  for a safety feature
[1805.32 --> 1806.84]  for a particular car
[1806.84 --> 1808.34]  the XC60
[1808.34 --> 1810.44]  and instead
[1810.44 --> 1813.26]  of automatically stopping
[1813.26 --> 1814.76]  it drove into
[1814.76 --> 1816.62]  a group of onlookers
[1816.62 --> 1817.56]  who were expecting
[1817.56 --> 1818.22]  the vehicle
[1818.22 --> 1819.86]  to automatically
[1819.86 --> 1821.14]  stop.
[1821.98 --> 1822.50]  Unfortunately
[1822.50 --> 1823.38]  according to
[1823.38 --> 1824.28]  Volvo spokesperson
[1824.28 --> 1826.20]  Stefan Elmstrom
[1826.20 --> 1828.24]  excuse me
[1828.24 --> 1828.92]  Elstrom
[1828.92 --> 1829.64]  and that
[1829.64 --> 1831.10]  oh with the dots above it
[1831.10 --> 1831.80]  I know that's not
[1831.80 --> 1832.40]  how you pronounce it
[1832.40 --> 1832.98]  I give up.
[1833.68 --> 1834.78]  The system is not
[1834.78 --> 1835.62]  meant to be used
[1835.62 --> 1836.26]  in this fashion
[1836.26 --> 1837.86]  and the car
[1837.86 --> 1839.44]  It's for city safety
[1839.44 --> 1840.24]  it's supposed to avoid
[1840.24 --> 1840.82]  rear enders
[1840.82 --> 1841.62]  with other cars
[1841.62 --> 1844.06]  not detecting pedestrians.
[1844.06 --> 1845.64]  That system is $3,000
[1845.64 --> 1846.22]  extra
[1846.22 --> 1847.26]  and is named
[1847.26 --> 1849.58]  the pedestrian detection system
[1849.58 --> 1850.54]  which was not
[1850.54 --> 1851.20]  in this thing.
[1852.66 --> 1853.72]  So yeah
[1853.72 --> 1854.20]  it's only about
[1854.20 --> 1855.28]  a 30 second long video
[1855.28 --> 1856.12]  so we might as well
[1856.12 --> 1856.38]  just
[1856.38 --> 1857.12]  It's a hilarious thing.
[1857.12 --> 1857.66]  We might as well
[1857.66 --> 1858.30]  just cringe
[1858.30 --> 1860.02]  and apparently
[1860.02 --> 1861.40]  no one was seriously hurt
[1861.40 --> 1862.32]  so we can
[1862.32 --> 1863.10]  sort of
[1863.10 --> 1863.94]  yeah
[1863.94 --> 1866.02]  So this was at a dealer
[1866.02 --> 1867.26]  so the dealer in question
[1867.26 --> 1867.72]  was
[1867.72 --> 1869.00]  Oh my goodness
[1869.00 --> 1870.58]  Wow
[1870.58 --> 1873.92]  That looks extremely painful
[1873.92 --> 1874.44]  Yep
[1874.44 --> 1875.68]  Hey guys
[1875.68 --> 1876.52]  So
[1876.52 --> 1877.30]  the dealer
[1877.30 --> 1878.48]  the dealer in question
[1878.48 --> 1879.68]  was trying to demonstrate
[1879.68 --> 1881.48]  the city safety feature
[1881.48 --> 1882.22]  but that system
[1882.22 --> 1883.36]  is not able to detect
[1883.36 --> 1884.12]  pedestrians
[1884.12 --> 1885.32]  because it lacked
[1885.32 --> 1886.06]  the optional
[1886.06 --> 1887.26]  pedestrian
[1887.26 --> 1888.78]  detection system
[1888.78 --> 1890.46]  Now this is
[1890.46 --> 1891.48]  something that is
[1891.48 --> 1892.90]  not unique to Volvo
[1892.90 --> 1894.26]  In fact
[1894.26 --> 1895.66]  when we were in Germany
[1895.66 --> 1897.10]  working on that video
[1897.10 --> 1898.90]  with the BMW 1 series
[1898.90 --> 1901.62]  BMW specifically said
[1901.62 --> 1902.24]  you know
[1902.24 --> 1902.78]  well hey
[1902.78 --> 1904.32]  this particular model
[1904.32 --> 1905.52]  at this trim level
[1905.52 --> 1907.08]  has detection for this
[1907.08 --> 1908.30]  and not this
[1908.30 --> 1909.38]  or this and not this
[1909.38 --> 1909.60]  so
[1909.60 --> 1910.18]  I mean
[1910.18 --> 1911.62]  here's a great example
[1911.62 --> 1912.28]  Oh shoot
[1912.28 --> 1913.94]  I forget what exactly
[1913.94 --> 1914.70]  they told me
[1914.70 --> 1916.56]  but it was that
[1916.56 --> 1918.82]  right
[1918.82 --> 1920.66]  it worked for cars
[1920.66 --> 1922.24]  and not pedestrians
[1922.24 --> 1924.16]  because of
[1924.16 --> 1925.26]  something to do with
[1925.26 --> 1926.04]  like it would
[1926.04 --> 1926.48]  right
[1926.48 --> 1927.06]  because if
[1927.06 --> 1928.00]  if you're trying to
[1928.00 --> 1928.72]  in a lot of
[1928.72 --> 1930.00]  in a lot of territories
[1930.00 --> 1930.66]  in a lot of places
[1930.66 --> 1930.96]  like
[1930.96 --> 1932.12]  maybe less of an issue
[1932.12 --> 1932.62]  in Germany
[1932.62 --> 1933.70]  maybe less of an issue
[1933.70 --> 1933.96]  here
[1933.96 --> 1934.82]  but in a lot of places
[1934.82 --> 1936.00]  the only way
[1936.00 --> 1937.46]  to turn onto a street
[1937.46 --> 1938.20]  when people are just
[1938.20 --> 1939.12]  walking across it
[1939.12 --> 1939.90]  is to kind of
[1939.90 --> 1940.78]  inch your way forward
[1940.78 --> 1941.72]  so
[1941.72 --> 1942.98]  they leave the
[1942.98 --> 1944.04]  pedestrian detection
[1944.04 --> 1944.54]  off
[1944.54 --> 1945.06]  because otherwise
[1945.06 --> 1946.18]  you'd never move anywhere
[1946.18 --> 1947.18]  and I went
[1947.18 --> 1948.30]  oh crap
[1948.30 --> 1949.08]  I didn't think of that
[1949.08 --> 1949.74]  yeah me neither
[1949.74 --> 1950.80]  that's not a thing here
[1950.80 --> 1951.84]  straight up did not
[1951.84 --> 1952.46]  think of that
[1952.46 --> 1952.76]  yeah
[1952.76 --> 1953.52]  wow
[1953.52 --> 1954.42]  that blows
[1954.42 --> 1954.94]  yeah
[1954.94 --> 1955.44]  look at my
[1955.44 --> 1956.42]  yeah your
[1956.42 --> 1957.70]  your computer is boned
[1957.70 --> 1958.46]  um
[1958.46 --> 1960.24]  so
[1960.24 --> 1961.90]  we're gonna just read here
[1961.90 --> 1962.98]  Volvo has also said
[1962.98 --> 1963.90]  that even if the car
[1963.90 --> 1965.36]  was equipped with that system
[1965.36 --> 1966.34]  the driver's foot
[1966.34 --> 1967.02]  on the accelerator
[1967.02 --> 1967.94]  would have overridden
[1967.94 --> 1969.04]  the automated system
[1969.04 --> 1970.30]  and they state
[1970.30 --> 1971.48]  I would like to emphasize
[1971.48 --> 1972.34]  that Volvo Cars
[1972.34 --> 1973.32]  strongly recommends
[1973.32 --> 1974.60]  to never perform
[1974.60 --> 1975.64]  any of these tests
[1975.64 --> 1976.50]  towards a real human
[1976.50 --> 1977.26]  only dummies
[1977.26 --> 1978.12]  or similar objects
[1978.12 --> 1978.72]  should be used
[1978.72 --> 1979.64]  so they're probably
[1979.64 --> 1980.62]  super not stoked
[1980.62 --> 1981.50]  with that dealership
[1981.50 --> 1983.12]  imagine how pissed
[1983.12 --> 1984.12]  like Volvo head office
[1984.12 --> 1985.18]  is at that dealership
[1985.18 --> 1987.74]  like who thought
[1987.74 --> 1988.74]  that was a good idea
[1988.74 --> 1990.40]  that is just
[1990.40 --> 1991.36]  that is just
[1991.36 --> 1992.98]  that's cringe
[1992.98 --> 1993.78]  even compared to
[1993.78 --> 1994.74]  the Scrapyard Wars
[1994.74 --> 1995.54]  series we're about
[1995.54 --> 1996.02]  to release
[1996.02 --> 1996.46]  which is
[1996.46 --> 1997.80]  pretty cringe
[1997.80 --> 1998.62]  pretty cringe
[1998.62 --> 1999.96]  oh god
[1999.96 --> 2000.78]  it's pretty cringe
[2000.78 --> 2002.04]  so okay guys
[2002.04 --> 2003.06]  I want to
[2003.06 --> 2003.94]  this is
[2003.94 --> 2004.42]  this is gonna be
[2004.42 --> 2005.02]  a good straw poll
[2005.02 --> 2005.40]  this is gonna be
[2005.40 --> 2006.00]  a good straw poll
[2006.00 --> 2007.78]  straw poll.me
[2007.78 --> 2008.14]  because
[2008.14 --> 2009.36]  our
[2009.36 --> 2010.50]  um
[2010.50 --> 2013.54]  no problem
[2013.54 --> 2014.46]  I got this
[2014.46 --> 2015.20]  um
[2015.20 --> 2017.88]  have you heard
[2017.88 --> 2019.42]  of the graphics
[2019.42 --> 2020.26]  card maker
[2020.26 --> 2021.30]  colorful
[2021.30 --> 2026.04]  all right
[2026.04 --> 2026.64]  so
[2026.64 --> 2027.56]  permissive
[2027.56 --> 2027.80]  vote
[2027.80 --> 2028.42]  duplication
[2028.42 --> 2028.88]  checking
[2028.88 --> 2030.02]  your poll
[2030.02 --> 2030.90]  has been created
[2030.90 --> 2031.64]  here we go
[2031.64 --> 2033.22]  have you heard
[2033.22 --> 2034.18]  of colorful
[2034.18 --> 2034.68]  because
[2034.68 --> 2035.74]  our audience
[2035.74 --> 2036.72]  is pretty heavily
[2036.72 --> 2037.24]  skewed
[2037.24 --> 2037.80]  towards
[2037.80 --> 2038.44]  Australia
[2038.44 --> 2039.26]  North America
[2039.26 --> 2040.28]  and
[2040.28 --> 2042.00]  countries in Europe
[2042.00 --> 2043.06]  where they speak
[2043.06 --> 2043.94]  a lot of English
[2043.94 --> 2044.72]  whether we're
[2044.72 --> 2045.44]  talking the UK
[2045.44 --> 2046.36]  or whether we're
[2046.36 --> 2047.16]  talking Germany
[2047.16 --> 2048.10]  like places where
[2048.10 --> 2049.50]  English is very
[2049.50 --> 2050.04]  widespread
[2050.04 --> 2051.92]  and colorful's
[2051.92 --> 2052.80]  main main
[2052.80 --> 2053.62]  territory of
[2053.62 --> 2054.72]  strength is not
[2054.72 --> 2055.50]  exactly in those
[2055.50 --> 2055.88]  places
[2055.88 --> 2057.46]  so I would love
[2057.46 --> 2058.24]  to I'd love to
[2058.24 --> 2058.82]  hear from you guys
[2058.82 --> 2059.24]  wow
[2059.24 --> 2060.40]  we are not
[2060.40 --> 2061.46]  getting many votes
[2061.46 --> 2062.52]  for have you
[2062.52 --> 2064.12]  heard of colorful
[2064.12 --> 2064.98]  uh do you have
[2064.98 --> 2065.58]  this uh do you
[2065.58 --> 2066.14]  have this news
[2066.14 --> 2066.98]  I like
[2066.98 --> 2068.00]  do you want
[2068.00 --> 2068.40]  do you want to
[2068.40 --> 2068.96]  do a reboot
[2068.96 --> 2070.06]  what is going on
[2070.06 --> 2071.04]  I can do a reboot
[2071.04 --> 2071.58]  there you go
[2071.58 --> 2071.94]  there you go
[2071.94 --> 2072.82]  but I don't know
[2072.82 --> 2073.20]  if it's gonna
[2073.20 --> 2074.52]  you got notes
[2074.52 --> 2075.46]  there we go
[2075.46 --> 2075.76]  alright
[2075.76 --> 2076.48]  so you want to
[2076.48 --> 2076.92]  tell them about
[2076.92 --> 2077.28]  colorful
[2077.28 --> 2077.94]  while we watch
[2077.94 --> 2078.52]  these votes come
[2078.52 --> 2079.18]  in with over
[2079.18 --> 2080.42]  50% of our
[2080.42 --> 2080.98]  viewers saying
[2080.98 --> 2081.76]  they have never
[2081.76 --> 2082.74]  heard of
[2082.74 --> 2083.32]  colorful
[2083.32 --> 2084.20]  the graphics
[2084.20 --> 2084.70]  card maker
[2084.70 --> 2085.06]  they're kind of
[2085.06 --> 2085.42]  fantastic
[2085.42 --> 2086.36]  they're huge
[2086.36 --> 2086.78]  by the way
[2086.78 --> 2087.36]  but anyways
[2087.36 --> 2088.30]  colorful is a
[2088.30 --> 2088.90]  China based
[2088.90 --> 2089.62]  company selling
[2089.62 --> 2090.26]  cards in the
[2090.26 --> 2091.08]  Chinese market
[2091.08 --> 2092.32]  that is probably
[2092.32 --> 2093.00]  all you really
[2093.00 --> 2093.50]  need to know
[2093.50 --> 2094.00]  to be completely
[2094.00 --> 2094.38]  honest
[2094.38 --> 2095.22]  colorful started
[2095.22 --> 2095.84]  out as
[2095.84 --> 2096.48]  a billion people
[2096.48 --> 2096.92]  in China
[2096.92 --> 2098.04]  and continues to
[2098.04 --> 2098.88]  be a vendor
[2098.88 --> 2099.82]  of wacky
[2099.82 --> 2100.30]  over the top
[2100.30 --> 2101.22]  GeForce GTX
[2101.22 --> 2101.68]  cards
[2101.68 --> 2102.64]  Palette is the
[2102.64 --> 2103.36]  biggest graphics card
[2103.36 --> 2104.52]  manufacturer by volume
[2104.52 --> 2105.64]  with a brand portfolio
[2105.64 --> 2106.62]  that includes
[2106.62 --> 2107.12]  Galaxy
[2107.12 --> 2107.68]  GainWord
[2107.68 --> 2108.30]  Point of View
[2108.30 --> 2109.64]  and its own
[2109.64 --> 2110.26]  namesake
[2110.26 --> 2111.46]  colorful could become
[2111.46 --> 2112.14]  the second largest
[2112.14 --> 2113.64]  graphics card maker
[2113.64 --> 2114.40]  in terms of shipments
[2114.40 --> 2115.20]  by the end of the year
[2115.20 --> 2116.52]  next to only Palette
[2116.52 --> 2117.36]  which honestly
[2117.36 --> 2118.36]  a lot of people
[2118.36 --> 2119.10]  in those demographics
[2119.10 --> 2119.68]  that you were just
[2119.68 --> 2120.14]  talking about
[2120.14 --> 2120.82]  probably don't know
[2120.82 --> 2121.52]  Palette that well
[2121.52 --> 2121.80]  either
[2121.80 --> 2122.20]  yeah
[2122.20 --> 2123.28]  I'm sure they know
[2123.28 --> 2123.62]  of them
[2123.62 --> 2124.44]  but not that well
[2124.44 --> 2125.40]  I only know this
[2125.40 --> 2127.06]  because I tried to
[2127.06 --> 2129.02]  I was actually
[2129.02 --> 2130.26]  the product manager
[2130.26 --> 2131.66]  for its Palette
[2131.66 --> 2133.20]  I was the product
[2133.20 --> 2134.16]  manager for Palette
[2134.16 --> 2135.12]  when they tried
[2135.12 --> 2135.60]  to expand
[2135.60 --> 2136.50]  into North America
[2136.50 --> 2139.88]  but it was
[2139.88 --> 2140.76]  totally unsuccessful
[2140.76 --> 2142.24]  and they bailed
[2142.24 --> 2143.32]  but yeah
[2143.32 --> 2144.02]  Palette
[2144.02 --> 2145.24]  is huge
[2145.24 --> 2145.74]  as well
[2145.74 --> 2147.10]  but the problem
[2147.10 --> 2147.58]  is that
[2147.58 --> 2149.12]  at the time
[2149.12 --> 2149.60]  anyway
[2149.60 --> 2151.18]  the people I talked
[2151.18 --> 2151.70]  to they didn't
[2151.70 --> 2152.40]  seem to really
[2152.40 --> 2153.24]  understand
[2153.24 --> 2154.68]  what the North
[2154.68 --> 2155.68]  American consumer
[2155.68 --> 2156.34]  cared about
[2156.34 --> 2157.54]  like when I
[2157.54 --> 2158.20]  sit down
[2158.20 --> 2158.88]  and have a meeting
[2158.88 --> 2159.36]  with them
[2159.36 --> 2160.76]  it'd be like
[2160.76 --> 2161.92]  yeah
[2161.92 --> 2162.46]  so
[2162.46 --> 2163.66]  you know
[2163.66 --> 2164.48]  we have huge
[2164.48 --> 2165.52]  production capacity
[2165.52 --> 2166.36]  and I'm like
[2166.36 --> 2167.12]  okay
[2167.12 --> 2169.20]  why is a customer
[2169.20 --> 2170.04]  going to buy your card
[2170.04 --> 2171.32]  well we can supply
[2171.32 --> 2172.62]  so many graphics cards
[2172.62 --> 2173.50]  we are the number one
[2173.50 --> 2174.48]  largest graphics card maker
[2174.48 --> 2174.80]  I'm like
[2174.80 --> 2175.56]  right
[2175.56 --> 2176.74]  but why are they
[2176.74 --> 2177.40]  going to buy it
[2177.40 --> 2178.68]  instead of an EVGA card
[2178.68 --> 2179.68]  because EVGA
[2179.68 --> 2180.66]  is a monster
[2180.66 --> 2181.68]  in North America
[2181.68 --> 2183.10]  if it's not EVGA
[2183.10 --> 2184.78]  it's straight up
[2184.78 --> 2185.78]  not worth as much
[2185.78 --> 2186.62]  for some reason
[2186.62 --> 2188.44]  I can't quite understand
[2188.44 --> 2189.08]  it myself
[2189.08 --> 2190.06]  but
[2190.06 --> 2192.96]  there you go
[2192.96 --> 2194.20]  and
[2194.20 --> 2195.66]  it never really
[2195.66 --> 2196.54]  got any further
[2196.54 --> 2197.08]  than that
[2197.08 --> 2197.82]  so
[2197.82 --> 2200.42]  both of those guys
[2200.42 --> 2200.96]  Palette
[2200.96 --> 2202.40]  and Colorful
[2202.40 --> 2203.68]  just have some
[2203.68 --> 2205.10]  challenges to overcome
[2205.10 --> 2205.72]  before they can
[2205.72 --> 2206.26]  yeah I'm going to show
[2206.26 --> 2206.74]  this in a minute
[2206.74 --> 2207.62]  before they can
[2207.62 --> 2208.92]  penetrate the markets
[2208.92 --> 2210.32]  where most of our viewers
[2210.32 --> 2211.12]  are based
[2211.12 --> 2211.60]  you know
[2211.60 --> 2212.24]  it's another one
[2212.24 --> 2212.92]  that a lot of people
[2212.92 --> 2213.72]  don't realize
[2213.72 --> 2214.68]  is as big as it is
[2214.68 --> 2215.24]  is Tool
[2215.24 --> 2216.80]  T-U-L
[2216.80 --> 2218.26]  that's
[2218.26 --> 2219.86]  if I recall correctly
[2219.86 --> 2221.06]  that's Power Color
[2221.06 --> 2221.66]  which by the way
[2221.66 --> 2222.66]  is different from Colorful
[2222.66 --> 2223.92]  Power Color
[2223.92 --> 2224.52]  I believe
[2224.52 --> 2225.46]  Zotac
[2225.46 --> 2226.40]  and Sapphire
[2226.40 --> 2228.50]  I think Tool
[2228.50 --> 2229.70]  is Sapphire
[2229.70 --> 2231.42]  I don't want to get
[2231.42 --> 2232.16]  that wrong
[2232.16 --> 2233.52]  though
[2233.52 --> 2236.70]  I don't remember
[2236.70 --> 2237.56]  who Vision Tech is
[2237.56 --> 2237.82]  no
[2237.82 --> 2238.06]  no
[2238.06 --> 2238.24]  no
[2238.24 --> 2238.46]  no
[2238.46 --> 2238.60]  no
[2238.60 --> 2238.76]  no
[2238.76 --> 2239.32]  apparently Tool
[2239.32 --> 2239.46]  is
[2239.46 --> 2239.80]  okay
[2239.80 --> 2241.40]  daughter
[2241.40 --> 2242.18]  while you search
[2242.18 --> 2242.50]  for that
[2242.50 --> 2243.38]  Colorful has been
[2243.38 --> 2244.76]  clocking an average
[2244.76 --> 2245.86]  of 500,000
[2245.86 --> 2246.48]  graphics cards
[2246.48 --> 2247.44]  shipped per month
[2247.44 --> 2249.94]  that's a lot
[2249.94 --> 2250.80]  isn't that crazy
[2250.80 --> 2252.10]  that's insane
[2252.10 --> 2253.88]  wow
[2253.88 --> 2255.90]  jeez
[2255.90 --> 2256.64]  they're projected
[2256.64 --> 2257.20]  to have shipped
[2257.20 --> 2258.48]  over 5 million cards
[2258.48 --> 2258.80]  in 2015
[2258.80 --> 2259.12]  okay
[2259.12 --> 2260.00]  I know Zotac
[2260.00 --> 2260.88]  and Sapphire
[2260.88 --> 2261.94]  are under
[2261.94 --> 2263.00]  they're actually
[2263.00 --> 2264.12]  owned by the same
[2264.12 --> 2265.72]  products
[2265.72 --> 2266.36]  graphics cards
[2266.36 --> 2267.32]  Tool might just
[2267.32 --> 2268.08]  be Power Color
[2268.08 --> 2269.04]  in terms of
[2269.04 --> 2270.16]  graphics cards
[2270.16 --> 2271.50]  Colorful has
[2271.50 --> 2272.08]  outsold
[2272.08 --> 2272.64]  Asus
[2272.64 --> 2273.22]  MSI
[2273.22 --> 2273.70]  Gigabyte
[2273.70 --> 2274.48]  and Zotac
[2274.48 --> 2277.60]  look at that
[2277.60 --> 2278.38]  yeah
[2278.38 --> 2279.02]  Tool is just
[2279.02 --> 2279.52]  Power Color
[2279.52 --> 2280.52]  I derped there
[2280.52 --> 2280.84]  but yeah
[2280.84 --> 2281.30]  but Zotac
[2281.30 --> 2281.84]  okay so yeah
[2281.84 --> 2282.44]  so that's something
[2282.44 --> 2282.82]  a lot of people
[2282.82 --> 2283.32]  don't realize
[2283.32 --> 2284.24]  is the brand names
[2284.24 --> 2285.02]  that they buy from
[2285.02 --> 2286.56]  sometimes don't have
[2286.56 --> 2287.50]  a whole ton to do
[2287.50 --> 2288.18]  with the
[2288.18 --> 2288.92]  the companies
[2288.92 --> 2289.38]  that are actually
[2289.38 --> 2289.86]  making them
[2289.86 --> 2290.66]  so companies like
[2290.66 --> 2291.28]  Asus
[2291.28 --> 2292.30]  and Gigabyte
[2292.30 --> 2293.14]  and MSI
[2293.14 --> 2293.98]  they make
[2293.98 --> 2295.14]  and brand
[2295.14 --> 2295.98]  and support
[2295.98 --> 2296.88]  their own graphics cards
[2296.88 --> 2297.70]  someone like EVGA
[2297.70 --> 2299.72]  is not a graphics card
[2299.72 --> 2300.30]  manufacturer
[2300.30 --> 2301.58]  they design
[2301.58 --> 2302.62]  but they do not
[2302.62 --> 2303.70]  actually build
[2303.70 --> 2304.62]  graphics cards
[2304.62 --> 2305.86]  they contract out
[2305.86 --> 2306.90]  so anyway
[2306.90 --> 2308.60]  just some idea
[2308.60 --> 2309.34]  why Colorful
[2309.34 --> 2310.22]  probably doesn't do
[2310.22 --> 2310.82]  quite as well
[2310.82 --> 2311.50]  in North America
[2311.50 --> 2312.46]  as they do in China
[2312.46 --> 2313.52]  that
[2313.52 --> 2314.74]  is one of their
[2314.74 --> 2316.12]  iGame graphics cards
[2316.12 --> 2317.36]  that's a 660 Ti
[2317.36 --> 2318.04]  and boy
[2318.04 --> 2319.04]  is it ever colorful
[2319.04 --> 2320.32]  there were some
[2320.32 --> 2320.74]  when I was
[2320.74 --> 2321.68]  researching them
[2321.68 --> 2322.58]  when I found out
[2322.58 --> 2323.14]  they were the
[2323.14 --> 2323.94]  going to be the biggest
[2323.94 --> 2324.80]  maker in the world
[2324.80 --> 2325.96]  I found some other
[2325.96 --> 2327.10]  just like bananas
[2327.10 --> 2327.78]  stuff as well
[2327.78 --> 2328.58]  like look at this thing
[2328.58 --> 2329.62]  have you seen their
[2329.62 --> 2330.34]  wow
[2330.34 --> 2331.52]  have you seen their
[2331.52 --> 2332.66]  like $1300
[2332.66 --> 2334.18]  GTX 980
[2334.18 --> 2336.18]  no I haven't
[2336.18 --> 2336.82]  look at how
[2336.82 --> 2337.84]  big it is
[2337.84 --> 2339.28]  let's see if I can
[2339.28 --> 2340.46]  I can find that one
[2340.46 --> 2341.08]  is this it
[2341.08 --> 2342.32]  no that's not it
[2342.32 --> 2342.96]  it's very
[2342.96 --> 2343.88]  oh is this it
[2343.88 --> 2344.54]  yeah that's it
[2344.54 --> 2345.46]  so that's their
[2345.46 --> 2346.42]  $1300
[2346.42 --> 2347.64]  triple slot
[2347.64 --> 2349.02]  GTX 980
[2349.02 --> 2350.16]  so they're just
[2350.16 --> 2351.20]  they're just kind of
[2351.20 --> 2351.68]  out there
[2351.68 --> 2352.52]  in terms of
[2352.52 --> 2353.34]  of their designs
[2353.34 --> 2353.70]  which is
[2353.70 --> 2354.40]  which is kind of cool
[2354.40 --> 2354.92]  I mean it's neat
[2354.92 --> 2355.32]  to be doing
[2355.32 --> 2355.82]  something a little
[2355.82 --> 2356.26]  bit different
[2356.26 --> 2357.58]  but uh
[2357.58 --> 2358.80]  oh I got signed
[2358.80 --> 2359.32]  out of my
[2359.32 --> 2359.90]  Google account
[2359.90 --> 2360.28]  what the
[2360.28 --> 2362.24]  iGame
[2362.24 --> 2363.70]  what the heck
[2363.70 --> 2364.62]  with a way too
[2364.62 --> 2365.56]  expensive 980
[2365.56 --> 2366.56]  and I have to do
[2366.56 --> 2367.20]  my two step
[2367.20 --> 2369.58]  I guess my
[2369.58 --> 2370.78]  my 30 days is up
[2370.78 --> 2371.06]  or whatever
[2371.06 --> 2372.34]  yeah yeah yeah
[2372.34 --> 2375.40]  I liked the
[2375.40 --> 2376.40]  rainbow motherboard
[2376.40 --> 2377.36]  from MSI
[2377.36 --> 2378.00]  back in the day
[2378.00 --> 2378.54]  looking at that
[2378.54 --> 2379.22]  card that you just
[2379.22 --> 2379.48]  showed
[2379.48 --> 2380.84]  oh come on now
[2380.84 --> 2382.70]  both Gigabyte
[2382.70 --> 2383.66]  and MSI
[2383.66 --> 2384.30]  were like that
[2384.30 --> 2384.76]  beautiful
[2384.76 --> 2386.86]  MSI 975
[2386.86 --> 2387.38]  motherboard
[2387.38 --> 2388.80]  just so attractive
[2388.80 --> 2389.84]  I think this
[2389.84 --> 2390.78]  is probably
[2390.78 --> 2391.54]  the era
[2391.54 --> 2392.22]  you're thinking
[2392.22 --> 2392.64]  of
[2392.64 --> 2394.06]  um
[2394.06 --> 2394.86]  oh no
[2394.86 --> 2396.16]  hold on
[2396.16 --> 2396.42]  no
[2396.42 --> 2398.06]  when did MSI
[2398.06 --> 2398.96]  start doing
[2398.96 --> 2399.66]  the um
[2399.66 --> 2399.68]  because there was
[2399.68 --> 2400.44]  actually a rainbow
[2400.44 --> 2401.24]  board wasn't there
[2401.24 --> 2402.14]  no no they didn't
[2402.14 --> 2402.70]  have a rainbow
[2402.70 --> 2403.46]  board but they
[2403.46 --> 2403.96]  had one that
[2403.96 --> 2405.06]  had a roller coaster
[2405.06 --> 2406.62]  yeah the roller coaster
[2406.62 --> 2407.14]  was sick
[2407.14 --> 2408.44]  I'll see if I can
[2408.44 --> 2408.92]  find here
[2408.92 --> 2409.74]  okay yeah here
[2409.74 --> 2410.30]  oh maybe it was
[2410.30 --> 2410.64]  Gigabyte
[2410.64 --> 2411.06]  maybe it was
[2411.06 --> 2411.34]  Gigabyte
[2411.34 --> 2412.74]  okay so this
[2412.74 --> 2413.88]  this was a
[2413.88 --> 2415.06]  hilarious motherboard
[2415.06 --> 2415.82]  so great
[2415.82 --> 2417.08]  uh no this
[2417.08 --> 2418.28]  was this was MSI
[2418.28 --> 2419.18]  this was MSI
[2419.18 --> 2419.60]  that was what I
[2419.60 --> 2420.18]  said that's what
[2420.18 --> 2420.64]  I thought right
[2420.64 --> 2422.20]  so they did this
[2422.20 --> 2423.00]  for a while
[2423.00 --> 2424.26]  this like roller
[2424.26 --> 2425.18]  coaster of heat
[2425.18 --> 2426.44]  pipes thing
[2426.44 --> 2427.52]  uh here's another
[2427.52 --> 2428.22]  one here's a bit
[2428.22 --> 2428.82]  of an older one
[2428.82 --> 2429.78]  that's a P35
[2429.78 --> 2431.54]  board um
[2431.54 --> 2432.80]  and Gigabyte
[2432.80 --> 2433.94]  used to have
[2433.94 --> 2434.80]  some just
[2434.80 --> 2436.74]  abominable looking
[2436.74 --> 2437.56]  motherboards as
[2437.56 --> 2438.98]  well uh this is
[2438.98 --> 2439.50]  probably what you're
[2439.50 --> 2440.08]  thinking in terms
[2440.08 --> 2440.72]  of like rainbow
[2440.72 --> 2441.28]  board right
[2441.28 --> 2441.52]  yeah I think that
[2441.52 --> 2441.88]  was it because
[2441.88 --> 2442.68]  the RAM slots
[2442.68 --> 2443.80]  yeah look at that
[2443.80 --> 2445.10]  four colors of RAM
[2445.10 --> 2445.42]  slots
[2445.42 --> 2446.16]  green blue
[2446.16 --> 2446.62]  different colors
[2446.62 --> 2446.96]  here
[2446.96 --> 2448.10]  orange purple
[2448.10 --> 2449.42]  blue light yellow
[2449.42 --> 2450.84]  yellow green blue
[2450.84 --> 2451.44]  purple
[2451.44 --> 2452.84]  copper
[2452.84 --> 2454.10]  black
[2454.10 --> 2455.30]  silver
[2455.30 --> 2456.12]  white
[2456.12 --> 2457.84]  so many
[2457.84 --> 2458.84]  oh my goodness
[2458.84 --> 2459.44]  that was a cool
[2459.44 --> 2460.18]  board though and
[2460.18 --> 2460.92]  we're probably gonna
[2460.92 --> 2462.02]  see some designs like
[2462.02 --> 2462.72]  this again because
[2462.72 --> 2463.64]  this was back when
[2463.64 --> 2465.18]  DDR3 was first coming
[2465.18 --> 2465.92]  out and like stuff
[2465.92 --> 2467.26]  like this four
[2467.26 --> 2468.08]  different colors of
[2468.08 --> 2469.32]  slots for adding
[2469.32 --> 2469.74]  cards
[2469.74 --> 2471.06]  yeah that's a really
[2471.06 --> 2472.20]  old AMD board that
[2472.20 --> 2472.62]  one that you're
[2472.62 --> 2473.10]  looking at
[2473.10 --> 2474.16]  so we're probably
[2474.16 --> 2474.98]  gonna see stuff like
[2474.98 --> 2475.66]  this again because
[2475.66 --> 2476.56]  this was a pretty
[2476.56 --> 2477.60]  common thing back
[2477.60 --> 2479.20]  when DDR2 or back
[2479.20 --> 2481.06]  when DDR3 was first
[2481.06 --> 2481.94]  coming out it was
[2481.94 --> 2483.10]  prohibitively expensive
[2483.10 --> 2484.48]  and so you can
[2484.48 --> 2485.14]  actually see this
[2485.14 --> 2486.92]  board has two sets
[2486.92 --> 2488.36]  of DDR2 slots so
[2488.36 --> 2489.78]  four DDR2 dims or
[2489.78 --> 2491.28]  two DDR3 dims
[2491.28 --> 2492.18]  because the assumption
[2492.18 --> 2492.86]  was if you were
[2492.86 --> 2494.76]  buying DDR3 you were
[2494.76 --> 2496.64]  not buying four
[2496.64 --> 2497.34]  sticks of it so it
[2497.34 --> 2497.82]  was supposed to be
[2497.82 --> 2498.70]  like an upgrade
[2498.70 --> 2500.20]  path not that it
[2500.20 --> 2501.18]  will make sense this
[2501.18 --> 2502.34]  time not that it
[2502.34 --> 2503.50]  made sense last time
[2503.50 --> 2504.62]  just buy a board
[2504.62 --> 2505.30]  that accepts the
[2505.30 --> 2505.90]  memory you're putting
[2505.90 --> 2507.34]  into it now and
[2507.34 --> 2508.10]  don't worry about that
[2508.10 --> 2509.28]  stuff but the
[2509.28 --> 2510.72]  upcoming CPUs from
[2510.72 --> 2512.14]  Intel Skylake if I
[2512.14 --> 2513.02]  recall correctly is
[2513.02 --> 2513.46]  when we're gonna
[2513.46 --> 2514.34]  actually have support
[2514.34 --> 2515.98]  for both DDR2 or
[2515.98 --> 2518.18]  both DDR3 and DDR4
[2518.18 --> 2519.26]  on the memory
[2519.26 --> 2520.28]  controller so we'll be
[2520.28 --> 2521.06]  able to do apples to
[2521.06 --> 2522.08]  apples comparisons even
[2522.08 --> 2522.88]  more apples to apples
[2522.88 --> 2523.50]  than we did before
[2523.50 --> 2524.12]  which by the way was
[2524.12 --> 2524.72]  pretty apples to
[2524.72 --> 2525.96]  apples for the people
[2525.96 --> 2526.96]  complaining about my
[2526.96 --> 2528.80]  DDR3 versus DDR4 test
[2528.80 --> 2530.60]  and we'll actually be
[2530.60 --> 2531.26]  able to do them on
[2531.26 --> 2534.38]  the same board so
[2534.38 --> 2535.68]  yeah DDR3 has really
[2535.68 --> 2536.30]  dropped in price
[2536.30 --> 2536.82]  lately hey
[2536.82 --> 2538.94]  distribution of clicks
[2538.94 --> 2539.80]  for the straw poll
[2539.80 --> 2541.12]  geographically oh
[2541.12 --> 2542.14]  they have that
[2542.14 --> 2543.56]  apparently so United
[2543.56 --> 2547.48]  States 48% UK 12%
[2547.48 --> 2548.94]  Canada 12% and
[2548.94 --> 2549.78]  then it falls off a
[2549.78 --> 2550.48]  cliff at least
[2550.48 --> 2551.22]  because Australia is
[2551.22 --> 2553.04]  sleeping yeah yeah
[2553.04 --> 2554.26]  Australia Australia
[2554.26 --> 2555.26]  likes to watch the
[2555.26 --> 2556.36]  WAN show in the
[2556.36 --> 2557.60]  morning I think yeah
[2557.60 --> 2559.74]  yeah all right so
[2559.74 --> 2561.16]  oh my computer's locked
[2561.16 --> 2561.98]  up oh it's back
[2561.98 --> 2564.68]  you are just not having
[2564.68 --> 2565.38]  a good time I don't
[2565.38 --> 2566.04]  know what's going on
[2566.04 --> 2567.86]  with this thing it's
[2567.86 --> 2569.00]  just been a rough week
[2569.00 --> 2570.12]  and I think we just
[2570.12 --> 2572.10]  need to it's so hot I
[2572.10 --> 2573.16]  know it's really hot in
[2573.16 --> 2574.82]  here I'm really looking
[2574.82 --> 2575.86]  forward to the new
[2575.86 --> 2577.60]  office I am really
[2577.60 --> 2578.94]  looking forward to the
[2578.94 --> 2581.54]  new office all right so
[2581.54 --> 2582.74]  this is a rumor from
[2582.74 --> 2584.38]  Apple insider do you
[2584.38 --> 2585.20]  have this or should I
[2585.20 --> 2586.08]  just do it because I
[2586.08 --> 2587.42]  could just do it I
[2587.42 --> 2588.86]  think I got it the
[2588.86 --> 2590.20]  original oh the OP
[2590.20 --> 2593.18]  here is dead hero and
[2593.18 --> 2595.20]  actually I should I should
[2595.20 --> 2596.46]  find some other OPs
[2596.46 --> 2597.26]  because I haven't been
[2597.26 --> 2598.04]  saying them I'm sorry
[2598.04 --> 2599.32]  guys ah Ming for the
[2599.32 --> 2602.04]  colorful one Raheeth
[2602.04 --> 2603.88]  Kumar SP for the Volvo
[2603.88 --> 2605.24]  someone spelt his name
[2605.24 --> 2610.54]  wrong for the GTX 980 Ti
[2610.54 --> 2612.98]  rumor and Alex goes hi
[2612.98 --> 2613.88]  I believe I did mention
[2613.88 --> 2614.68]  and he's doing a great
[2614.68 --> 2615.84]  job of maintaining that
[2615.84 --> 2617.56]  thread with with all the
[2617.56 --> 2618.42]  I really like that when
[2618.42 --> 2618.98]  someone does show
[2618.98 --> 2619.76]  coverage and they keep
[2619.76 --> 2620.48]  the thread updated
[2620.48 --> 2622.00]  victorious does that a
[2622.00 --> 2623.08]  lot of with Apple events
[2623.08 --> 2626.60]  yeah okay so Microsoft
[2626.60 --> 2629.70]  may be rumored to be
[2629.70 --> 2631.26]  interested in acquiring
[2631.26 --> 2634.76]  Blackberry so we could
[2634.76 --> 2636.86]  have a we could have the
[2636.86 --> 2638.84]  least relevant phone
[2638.84 --> 2640.28]  platform with all the
[2640.28 --> 2641.74]  security that Blackberry
[2641.74 --> 2644.22]  brings to a phone
[2644.22 --> 2645.26]  platform with their
[2645.26 --> 2646.56]  expertise and patents and
[2646.56 --> 2648.16]  stuff I would really much
[2648.16 --> 2649.26]  rather Apple or Google
[2649.26 --> 2650.30]  acquired them straight
[2650.30 --> 2652.00]  just straight up because
[2652.00 --> 2654.18]  so many more devices would
[2654.18 --> 2655.20]  be able to take advantage
[2655.20 --> 2656.84]  of Blackberry's expertise
[2656.84 --> 2657.58]  because let's face it
[2657.58 --> 2658.40]  their expertise isn't
[2658.40 --> 2659.28]  making phones that people
[2659.28 --> 2660.82]  buy no their expertise
[2660.82 --> 2661.96]  security is mobile device
[2661.96 --> 2663.44]  security and I would love
[2663.44 --> 2664.78]  for some of that influence
[2664.78 --> 2666.10]  to be on the Android
[2666.10 --> 2668.18]  platform or even iOS which
[2668.18 --> 2669.76]  isn't that bad compared to
[2669.76 --> 2672.32]  Android so there you go
[2672.32 --> 2673.16]  I kind of liked it
[2673.16 --> 2674.30]  I'm sorry
[2674.30 --> 2675.76]  I kind of liked it
[2675.76 --> 2676.56]  oh the iPhone
[2676.56 --> 2676.96]  yeah
[2676.96 --> 2677.88]  it's not that bad
[2677.88 --> 2678.62]  there's things that I
[2678.62 --> 2678.76]  made
[2678.76 --> 2679.50]  here why don't you just
[2679.50 --> 2680.12]  talk about it because
[2680.12 --> 2680.84]  you're not going to be
[2680.84 --> 2681.96]  doing a review so we can
[2681.96 --> 2682.86]  know we can talk about
[2682.86 --> 2684.10]  this rumor which there's
[2684.10 --> 2684.82]  not really much to say
[2684.82 --> 2686.28]  there's a rumor in fact
[2686.28 --> 2686.96]  why don't I just finish
[2686.96 --> 2689.40]  this Microsoft likely
[2689.40 --> 2690.36]  be it motivated by a
[2690.36 --> 2691.24]  desire to deepen its
[2691.24 --> 2692.02]  foray into the mobile
[2692.02 --> 2693.22]  enterprise and gain access
[2693.22 --> 2694.16]  to Blackberry's patent
[2694.16 --> 2695.56]  trove same reason anyone
[2695.56 --> 2696.22]  would be interested in
[2696.22 --> 2696.52]  Blackberry
[2696.52 --> 2698.16]  Chinese technology firms
[2698.16 --> 2699.36]  Huawei Lenovo and
[2699.36 --> 2700.86]  Xiaomi have also expressed
[2700.86 --> 2702.18]  interest no party has
[2702.18 --> 2703.06]  taken definite steps
[2703.06 --> 2703.80]  towards an acquisition
[2703.80 --> 2704.98]  which basically means
[2704.98 --> 2706.48]  this article is fluff
[2706.48 --> 2707.96]  yeah and Blackberry sold
[2707.96 --> 2709.40]  some 1.6 million phones
[2709.40 --> 2710.40]  during its fiscal fourth
[2710.40 --> 2711.70]  quarter whereas Apple
[2711.70 --> 2713.98]  sold 74.5 million in the
[2713.98 --> 2715.86]  same period 1.6 million
[2715.86 --> 2716.76]  phones is not going to
[2716.76 --> 2717.36]  keep you in business
[2717.36 --> 2718.10]  Blackberry I'm very
[2718.10 --> 2718.98]  sorry I do love you
[2718.98 --> 2719.82]  dearly but I just wish
[2719.82 --> 2720.76]  your technology was in a
[2720.76 --> 2721.54]  phone platform that I
[2721.54 --> 2722.38]  actually want to use
[2722.38 --> 2723.60]  carry on talk about your
[2723.60 --> 2724.72]  iOS experience how long
[2724.72 --> 2725.64]  are you on it so
[2725.64 --> 2727.70]  a month yeah okay
[2727.70 --> 2729.72]  first time right yes
[2729.72 --> 2732.44]  iMessage is great iMessage
[2732.44 --> 2733.90]  just craps all over
[2733.90 --> 2736.54]  Hangouts like it's
[2736.54 --> 2738.12]  disgusting iMessage is
[2738.12 --> 2739.14]  just so much better
[2739.14 --> 2740.76]  there's so much crap all
[2740.76 --> 2741.74]  over Hangouts you just
[2741.74 --> 2742.52]  don't even want to touch
[2742.52 --> 2743.28]  it anymore that bad
[2743.28 --> 2744.94]  huh I don't find Hangouts
[2744.94 --> 2745.82]  that bad but I don't
[2745.82 --> 2746.86]  like using Hangouts as a
[2746.86 --> 2747.96]  mix I don't like it
[2747.96 --> 2748.74]  either I think Hangouts
[2748.74 --> 2749.54]  handles it really well
[2749.54 --> 2750.38]  I think Hangouts is great
[2750.38 --> 2751.86]  as just web messaging that
[2751.86 --> 2752.74]  is synced with your phone
[2752.74 --> 2754.12]  I think that's really good
[2754.12 --> 2757.52]  but I don't like iMessage to
[2757.52 --> 2758.68]  use it for text messaging
[2758.68 --> 2760.12]  so then you have to use
[2760.12 --> 2761.62]  messaging as well and
[2761.62 --> 2763.38]  messaging is garbage so
[2763.38 --> 2764.34]  then you have to use some
[2764.34 --> 2765.56]  other app and then that
[2765.56 --> 2766.66]  some other app doesn't
[2766.66 --> 2767.32]  really work with your
[2767.32 --> 2768.76]  smartwatch very well so
[2768.76 --> 2770.36]  then that's a garbage and
[2770.36 --> 2772.50]  it's just frustrating and
[2772.50 --> 2773.96]  then all of the rest of the
[2773.96 --> 2774.82]  things that I like about the
[2774.82 --> 2775.90]  phone have nothing to do
[2775.90 --> 2776.62]  with the fact that it's an
[2776.62 --> 2779.38]  iPhone right 100% to do
[2779.38 --> 2780.36]  with the fact that apps
[2780.36 --> 2781.20]  are usually made better
[2781.20 --> 2783.22]  for the iPhones like
[2783.22 --> 2784.80]  Instagram works way better
[2784.80 --> 2786.26]  the Twitter app on iOS is
[2786.26 --> 2789.34]  way nicer just that I
[2789.34 --> 2791.98]  didn't like how the phone
[2791.98 --> 2792.90]  worked in terms of
[2792.90 --> 2794.06]  customizability I didn't
[2794.06 --> 2795.58]  like that I can't really
[2795.58 --> 2796.68]  mess with my home page as
[2796.68 --> 2798.50]  much as I did before I
[2798.50 --> 2799.26]  don't like that I can't
[2799.26 --> 2801.18]  change a lot of things but
[2801.18 --> 2803.88]  iMessage being so good and
[2803.88 --> 2805.52]  all the apps being just
[2805.52 --> 2806.92]  better developed for iOS was
[2806.92 --> 2808.18]  really nice mainly because I
[2808.18 --> 2809.18]  use Instagram and Twitter a
[2809.18 --> 2811.46]  lot right and like
[2811.46 --> 2812.94]  Instagram is huge like this
[2812.94 --> 2814.12]  phone trying to take a
[2814.12 --> 2814.94]  picture with it I'm like
[2814.94 --> 2817.24]  wow this looks terrible and
[2817.24 --> 2818.46]  then I click the take photo
[2818.46 --> 2820.52]  button and it's like wow it
[2820.52 --> 2822.46]  looks way better that's dumb
[2822.46 --> 2823.78]  and then I upload it on
[2823.78 --> 2825.04]  Instagram and I'm like wow it
[2825.04 --> 2825.82]  looks bad again
[2825.82 --> 2830.80]  what like what do I do and
[2830.80 --> 2832.02]  then on iPhone it's like okay it
[2832.02 --> 2833.36]  looks like this press button okay
[2833.36 --> 2834.24]  it still looks like that
[2834.24 --> 2835.60]  upload to Instagram okay yeah
[2835.60 --> 2837.92]  okay everything's fine I don't
[2837.92 --> 2839.58]  know yeah it's so frustrating
[2839.58 --> 2841.22]  and I mean another great
[2841.22 --> 2842.52]  example would be Vessel
[2842.52 --> 2844.84]  Vessel still doesn't have an
[2844.84 --> 2846.46]  Android app why don't they
[2846.46 --> 2848.08]  have an Android app because
[2848.08 --> 2850.42]  whether people like it or not I
[2850.42 --> 2851.68]  don't care and is that
[2851.68 --> 2853.28]  Android's fault no I still
[2853.28 --> 2854.54]  really like Android but it's
[2854.54 --> 2855.96]  just it's nice when you get all
[2855.96 --> 2857.96]  the apps so I don't if you
[2857.96 --> 2859.54]  don't like this I don't care
[2859.54 --> 2861.26]  it's been it's been tackled
[2861.26 --> 2862.32]  again and again and again and
[2862.32 --> 2863.58]  there's there could be a
[2863.58 --> 2865.48]  billion different reasons for
[2865.48 --> 2868.68]  why but iOS users spend more
[2868.68 --> 2870.84]  money on apps they are much
[2870.84 --> 2872.72]  more likely to pay for an app I
[2872.72 --> 2874.04]  don't care why let's not get
[2874.04 --> 2876.44]  into why socioeconomic blah blah
[2876.44 --> 2877.42]  blah blah blah blah don't care
[2877.42 --> 2879.30]  someone in the chat was like
[2879.30 --> 2880.58]  doesn't know how to focus no
[2880.58 --> 2882.24]  that's actually I was making two
[2882.24 --> 2884.72]  comments in one it it takes the
[2884.72 --> 2887.08]  photo fine it looks like garbage
[2887.08 --> 2888.30]  and you take the photo and it
[2888.30 --> 2889.48]  looks really good and I could
[2889.48 --> 2890.48]  transfer that off to onto my
[2890.48 --> 2891.64]  computer and it would look fine
[2891.64 --> 2893.54]  and everything's good it's it's
[2893.54 --> 2894.68]  when you upload things to
[2894.68 --> 2896.34]  Instagram on Android it kills
[2896.34 --> 2897.64]  the quality and this is exactly
[2897.64 --> 2899.36]  one of the issues with Android is
[2899.36 --> 2900.88]  someone over there who has a
[2900.88 --> 2902.38]  viewfinder whose preview is
[2902.38 --> 2903.48]  actually very close to the
[2903.48 --> 2904.84]  picture you take is probably
[2904.84 --> 2905.88]  telling you you don't know what
[2905.88 --> 2907.44]  you're doing but actually my
[2907.44 --> 2909.68]  moto x did it fine many Android
[2909.68 --> 2911.66]  phones have viewfinders that look
[2911.66 --> 2913.26]  very little like the finished
[2913.26 --> 2914.82]  picture my droid turbo for
[2914.82 --> 2917.36]  example not to the same extent but
[2917.36 --> 2919.24]  does have a viewfinder that looks
[2919.24 --> 2921.24]  significantly worse than the
[2921.24 --> 2923.12]  finished picture and it's it's a
[2923.12 --> 2925.00]  it's a processing thing it's an
[2925.00 --> 2927.00]  optimization thing and does it
[2927.00 --> 2928.96]  really matter as long as my
[2928.96 --> 2931.16]  picture looks good I guess not but
[2931.16 --> 2931.94]  it doesn't because you're
[2931.94 --> 2933.12]  uploading it but it's part of the
[2933.12 --> 2934.10]  experience and then that's a
[2934.10 --> 2935.58]  different step that's the
[2935.58 --> 2937.02]  Instagram app compression not
[2937.02 --> 2938.10]  being handled as well on the
[2938.10 --> 2939.42]  Android and it's hard to tell like
[2939.42 --> 2941.46]  how good the photo you're taking is
[2941.46 --> 2943.82]  until after you take it yeah which is
[2943.82 --> 2945.94]  stupid and kind of hurts the
[2945.94 --> 2947.02]  experience and the other thing is
[2947.02 --> 2948.44]  app availability so if you're
[2948.44 --> 2950.24]  developing a paid app or an app for
[2950.24 --> 2952.02]  a paid service like vessel you're
[2952.02 --> 2953.44]  spending all of your time and all of
[2953.44 --> 2954.92]  your money developing the iOS one
[2954.92 --> 2956.72]  because whether whether you guys
[2956.72 --> 2958.02]  personally like it or not I don't
[2958.02 --> 2962.14]  care Apple iOS users are more likely
[2962.14 --> 2963.50]  to pay for a service that they're
[2963.50 --> 2967.90]  using so you ask government proposes
[2967.90 --> 2970.60]  to classify cyber security or hacking
[2970.60 --> 2973.96]  tools as weapons of war isn't the
[2973.96 --> 2975.34]  future going to be an interesting
[2975.34 --> 2978.56]  time this was posted by face a loo and
[2978.56 --> 2980.44]  the original article here is from beta
[2980.44 --> 2982.60]  news looks a little something like
[2982.60 --> 2986.92]  that I'm sharing it right now and it's
[2986.92 --> 2989.44]  funny because in spite of all the NSA
[2989.44 --> 2991.12]  stuff that's happened over the last
[2991.12 --> 2993.46]  couple of years and and all of the
[2993.46 --> 2996.10]  concern that we have about our about
[2996.10 --> 2999.22]  our ongoing online privacy and privacy in
[2999.22 --> 3000.72]  general I mean you look at what
[3000.72 --> 3002.30]  countries like China are doing where
[3002.30 --> 3004.94]  they're creating these social merit
[3004.94 --> 3007.14]  programs for their citizens where
[3007.14 --> 3010.66]  they're just straight up no not even
[3010.66 --> 3012.60]  hiding it we are spying on literally
[3012.60 --> 3014.94]  everything you do don't screw it up
[3014.94 --> 3019.26]  which is insane I mean including like
[3019.26 --> 3023.22]  political opinion I don't I don't I did
[3023.22 --> 3028.80]  like I don't see I don't see why most
[3028.80 --> 3034.38]  people would need tools for would would
[3034.38 --> 3037.26]  need intrusion software most people
[3037.26 --> 3038.70]  shouldn't need that but let's say for
[3038.70 --> 3042.14]  example you are a white hat okay and
[3042.14 --> 3046.02]  you're working on attacking something to
[3046.02 --> 3048.72]  find out how to block against an attack
[3048.72 --> 3052.08]  this is absolutely a thing and so how
[3052.08 --> 3054.36]  do how does the law get amended to
[3054.36 --> 3055.80]  account for that because let's face it
[3055.80 --> 3057.78]  that you can't penetration test your own
[3057.78 --> 3059.60]  system you're gonna be sitting and the
[3059.60 --> 3061.86]  guys who are gonna break the law are
[3061.86 --> 3063.54]  gonna break the law the guys who are out
[3063.54 --> 3065.40]  there trying to siphon tens of millions
[3065.40 --> 3067.86]  of dollars from bank accounts or
[3067.86 --> 3069.36]  whatever it is that they're trying to
[3069.36 --> 3071.28]  to take advantage of what was the one
[3071.28 --> 3074.28]  where it was it was taking pennies off of
[3074.28 --> 3076.56]  transactions in flight that must have been
[3076.56 --> 3078.20]  about a year ago or something like that
[3078.20 --> 3079.68]  yeah isn't that the storyline of
[3079.68 --> 3082.38]  office space too I can't remember but
[3082.38 --> 3083.56]  like I think it happened I'm just
[3083.56 --> 3086.10]  saying yeah but but but anyway are
[3086.10 --> 3087.74]  these guys really going to be deterred by
[3087.74 --> 3089.82]  oh you know well I guess on top of the
[3089.82 --> 3091.14]  millions of dollars we're stealing we'll
[3091.14 --> 3093.40]  also own a weapon of war I mean it
[3093.40 --> 3095.46]  might deter the average you know high
[3095.46 --> 3097.32]  school kid who wants to just you know
[3097.32 --> 3099.26]  be a dork script kitty and attack
[3099.26 --> 3102.52]  something but it just seems kind of
[3102.52 --> 3105.50]  like tightening and like what what defines
[3105.50 --> 3107.88]  the hacking tool yeah can you just
[3107.88 --> 3110.24]  generally classify a whole bunch of
[3110.24 --> 3111.70]  different distributions of Linux as
[3111.70 --> 3114.80]  hacking tools because they get used for
[3114.80 --> 3117.00]  that so the new definition of
[3117.00 --> 3118.52]  intrusion software is a tool which is
[3118.52 --> 3119.94]  capable of extraction and or
[3119.94 --> 3121.34]  modification of data or information
[3121.34 --> 3122.82]  from a computer or networked enabled
[3122.82 --> 3125.56]  device but like there's distributions
[3125.56 --> 3127.36]  of I don't remember what it's called
[3127.36 --> 3129.56]  but there's distributions of Linux that
[3129.56 --> 3133.48]  you use for attacking routers but you can
[3133.48 --> 3136.98]  use it for back back trace back back
[3136.98 --> 3140.48]  trace I don't know whatever moving on
[3140.48 --> 3144.38]  all right so uh op here is twisted
[3144.38 --> 3146.50]  dictator and the original articles from
[3146.50 --> 3148.26]  polygon do you have this link yeah it
[3148.26 --> 3149.36]  seems to be working a little better now
[3149.36 --> 3151.12]  all right it kind of pulled things
[3151.12 --> 3154.06]  together here so there has been a star
[3154.06 --> 3155.44]  citizen leak
[3155.44 --> 3158.94]  so you can see the future of star a
[3158.94 --> 3161.74]  citizen thanks to a leak okay I didn't
[3161.74 --> 3163.64]  pull together enough oh you didn't
[3163.64 --> 3165.58]  manage to post the link I did but the
[3165.58 --> 3170.32]  the site's not really loading go go go go
[3170.32 --> 3174.68]  go yay internet so we can see some
[3174.68 --> 3178.74]  ships and dual stinger sick hey wow look
[3178.74 --> 3180.48]  how gorgeous that looks I want this game
[3180.48 --> 3183.16]  to be a thing with the with the very
[3183.16 --> 3185.06]  limited rendering options in the graphic
[3185.06 --> 3186.32]  setting and stuff right now you can't
[3186.32 --> 3187.70]  even turn it up to look this good I mean
[3187.70 --> 3190.48]  look at that look at the shadows look at
[3190.48 --> 3194.32]  the illumination like parts of what this
[3194.32 --> 3196.56]  isn't in engine yeah this isn't in
[3196.56 --> 3199.40]  yeah yeah so you can obviously turn it up
[3199.40 --> 3201.58]  look that good this is you can't even
[3201.58 --> 3203.60]  run anti-aliasing is this not user
[3203.60 --> 3207.30]  leaked no what because that looks like
[3207.30 --> 3210.04]  we've got some 50 gigabyte it was a 48
[3210.04 --> 3212.22]  gigabyte download hold on a second
[3212.22 --> 3217.38]  leaked by community manager yeah he
[3217.38 --> 3219.42]  accidentally leaked part of a URL someone
[3219.42 --> 3221.30]  guessed the rest of the URL and it was a
[3221.30 --> 3224.92]  download that was 48 gigabytes some of
[3224.92 --> 3226.70]  the leaked material could include story
[3226.70 --> 3230.36]  spoilers guys so if you don't want any
[3230.36 --> 3232.04]  information on the squadron 42 storyline
[3232.72 --> 3235.04]  before you play it you probably shouldn't
[3235.80 --> 3239.32]  do anything so the download had a lot of
[3239.32 --> 3241.66]  different things assets people extracted
[3241.66 --> 3247.58]  them and then basically put them in in
[3247.58 --> 3249.88]  engine so there you go guys we are
[3249.88 --> 3251.92]  looking at stuff that isn't in the game
[3251.92 --> 3254.68]  but can be kind of hacksword in there
[3254.68 --> 3256.18]  so someone recorded that so that looks
[3256.18 --> 3258.84]  that good on a user's computer I didn't
[3258.84 --> 3260.30]  even think because I thought it has no
[3260.30 --> 3261.96]  support for AA and that looked really
[3261.96 --> 3264.34]  sharp but yeah but haven't you played in
[3264.34 --> 3266.04]  engine already yeah it's really sharp
[3266.04 --> 3268.88]  with ODA anyways oh so you still have
[3268.88 --> 3271.54]  some issues here there okay okay you're
[3271.54 --> 3272.90]  right now that I've blown it up full
[3272.90 --> 3274.32]  screen it doesn't look quite as
[3274.32 --> 3276.54]  impressive as it did before it still
[3276.54 --> 3279.12]  looks pretty good though yeah yeah and
[3279.12 --> 3281.50]  one thing is there's a lot more thin and
[3281.50 --> 3284.24]  dense what I don't know what it's called
[3284.24 --> 3285.82]  but when there's like lots of stuff there
[3285.82 --> 3287.64]  there's a lot more of that on the ship
[3287.64 --> 3289.60]  than most of the ships I've got very
[3289.60 --> 3291.10]  cool so it turns out they are actually
[3291.10 --> 3295.50]  working on it so that's good yeah we
[3295.50 --> 3297.94]  were rendered in engine yeah all right
[3297.94 --> 3300.36]  so Google files patent oh in engine not
[3300.36 --> 3303.18]  in real time okay there you go that
[3303.18 --> 3305.04]  probably helped it Google files a patent
[3305.04 --> 3308.08]  for a smart teddy bear that would watch
[3308.08 --> 3310.12]  and listen to users so this was posted
[3310.12 --> 3313.70]  by annihilation that's kind of a funny
[3313.70 --> 3316.92]  username for that particular post on the
[3316.92 --> 3318.90]  forum let's go ahead and pop this up the
[3318.90 --> 3321.96]  original article was on the mirror and
[3321.96 --> 3326.28]  apparently that one's gone now yay sorry
[3326.28 --> 3329.26]  we cannot find that page let's go ahead
[3329.26 --> 3332.28]  and global news dot CA also works yeah
[3332.28 --> 3335.44]  Canada okay we talked about creepy
[3335.44 --> 3338.18]  petty petty bears oh that went somewhere
[3338.18 --> 3338.64]  worse
[3338.64 --> 3345.24]  Wow all right so it describes a stuffed
[3345.24 --> 3347.14]  toy such as a bear that would be able to
[3347.14 --> 3350.20]  control devices like TV and music players
[3350.20 --> 3352.48]  so look look how creepy this drawing is
[3352.48 --> 3357.52]  microphones your cameras speakers
[3357.52 --> 3364.96]  motors world's creepiest toy so using
[3364.96 --> 3367.24]  sensors and cameras it could sense your
[3367.24 --> 3368.74]  presence and turn its head around to
[3368.74 --> 3371.68]  look at you with a passphrase it could
[3371.68 --> 3373.48]  activate and you could voice control
[3373.48 --> 3375.94]  stuff the patent filing was published
[3375.94 --> 3377.28]  last week but they actually applied for
[3377.28 --> 3380.50]  the patent back in 2010 and Google's only
[3380.50 --> 3382.62]  real statement was I'll be held patents on
[3382.62 --> 3383.90]  a variety of ideas
[3383.90 --> 3386.86]  some of those ideas later mature into real
[3386.86 --> 3390.40]  products or services some don't so it
[3390.40 --> 3391.18]  doesn't sound like they're super
[3391.18 --> 3395.08]  confident yeah I I suspect it's gonna be a
[3395.08 --> 3396.28]  while before anything like that happens
[3396.28 --> 3402.84]  however like in that form like you know like
[3402.84 --> 3404.64]  like Chucky style it's gonna be a while
[3404.64 --> 3407.50]  before we see anything like that but it's
[3407.50 --> 3410.74]  not like imagine a Furby that also recorded
[3410.74 --> 3414.34]  everything you did like you know how creepy
[3414.34 --> 3417.62]  people thought the Furbies were yeah yeah so
[3417.62 --> 3420.70]  think about a Furby that also records it I mean is the
[3420.70 --> 3424.30]  idea really that different from this bad boy
[3424.30 --> 3426.94]  right here I forget what this thing's called but I
[3426.94 --> 3429.70]  remember we talked about it on the we talked
[3429.70 --> 3432.00]  about it on WAN show oh you don't even want to see
[3432.00 --> 3435.20]  he's showing me his his his hair is all like matted
[3435.20 --> 3438.34]  down from his watch like mine's no but mine's wet yeah
[3438.34 --> 3446.80]  oh well my whole arms wet that's why you can't tell okay so what is what is this
[3446.80 --> 3451.90]  bloody thing called creators of the Cognitoi yeah that's the one so this is
[3451.90 --> 3456.34]  the dinosaur that uses IBM supercomputer to answer questions that you ask it and
[3456.34 --> 3460.72]  learn over time and stuff like that so you know is Google's idea really is
[3460.72 --> 3463.84]  putting a camera and a microphone and speakers on it really that far away I
[3463.84 --> 3466.12]  think this one already has a microphone and speakers it just doesn't have a
[3466.12 --> 3470.62]  camera so smart toys are gonna be a thing I just I don't know that I want it
[3470.62 --> 3475.12]  to be like my TV remote you know and that was kind of covered by the Google
[3475.12 --> 3478.94]  patent but then again I guess you go ahead and patent something early enough
[3478.94 --> 3482.08]  and you don't even have to be the one who builds it and you can still benefit
[3482.08 --> 3489.16]  from that mm-hmm all right Microsoft manages to cut the bandwidth required for
[3489.16 --> 3493.62]  cloud game streaming by over 80% this is posted by Victoria's Secret the
[3493.62 --> 3498.96]  original article here is from geek.com do you have the link here yeah this is a
[3498.96 --> 3505.08]  really big deal because the two main hurdles for cloud-based gaming number one
[3505.08 --> 3512.28]  is gonna be latency as fiber connections roll out that will become less of an
[3512.28 --> 3518.82]  issue as companies get serious about their cloud gaming services they will start
[3518.82 --> 3523.44]  to roll out more hubs so there will be a much better chance that you're close
[3523.44 --> 3528.88]  enough to a center to like a render center in order to play the game but
[3528.88 --> 3533.94]  number two is data limits I mean you talk to gamers and many of them are still
[3533.94 --> 3538.38]  buying physical media because their download limit is so small games are a
[3538.38 --> 3542.20]  thing I personally know people that bought Witcher 3 because they're like well
[3542.20 --> 3546.84]  I'll go over my bandwidth cap so I bought a physical copy straight up so game
[3546.84 --> 3551.52]  streaming is a way that your games bandwidth use can be the gift that
[3551.52 --> 3559.68]  keeps on giving every time you play it you are downloading more but instead um
[3559.68 --> 3563.82]  hmm and it's it's funny the article points that you'd think someone like Sony
[3563.82 --> 3567.78]  would be more concerned with this actually I would have expected Nvidia to be
[3567.78 --> 3573.84]  on top of something like this but basically what it does is it actually uses the
[3573.84 --> 3578.88]  power of the game console or tablet or other device on the other side to do
[3578.88 --> 3581.88]  some of the rendering and why would you expect Sony to be more on top of this
[3581.88 --> 3585.82]  when Microsoft has been talking about this since before the Xbox came out yeah
[3585.82 --> 3591.66]  this has been the the golden ticket that never showed up for the Xbox one yeah so
[3591.66 --> 3597.30]  basically the local machine will do some of the work while the heavy lifting can be
[3597.30 --> 3602.82]  done on a remote machine so you will do a rough sketch essentially and then the
[3602.82 --> 3609.78]  server still does shadows texture mapping and fine-grained details very very cool
[3609.78 --> 3612.96]  and it makes a huge difference to the amount of data required to stream a game
[3612.96 --> 3616.98]  without impacting how the game plays so they used it on doom 3 streamed at 60 FPS
[3616.98 --> 3621.00]  with and this is based on the article so we haven't seen it with no
[3621.00 --> 3626.82]  discernible difference between streaming with and without kahaway or kahaway or
[3626.82 --> 3631.18]  whatever they're whatever they're calling this this bandwidth reduction tool it's the
[3631.18 --> 3634.78]  Hawaiian word for stream apparently but yeah I don't know how to pronounce that
[3634.78 --> 3637.90]  so apparently there's also no noticeable differences in response times but again
[3637.90 --> 3644.08]  we were not the ones that tested this I mean if Microsoft's plan all along was to
[3644.08 --> 3650.98]  have the Xbox one basically capable of competing with the PlayStation 5 or
[3650.98 --> 3655.62]  something like that where they could really stretch out that lifecycle by doing
[3655.62 --> 3660.04]  cloud-based rendering who knows maybe in five years or eight years we're gonna be
[3660.04 --> 3664.18]  going holy crap did they ever have the right idea with the X bone they're taking
[3664.18 --> 3670.36]  their sweet freaking time with it but yeah that could be really interesting that
[3670.36 --> 3674.44]  was by Victoria's Secret I don't know if we called that or not yeah yes I did also
[3674.44 --> 3680.14]  someone in the chat when we were talking about smart toys posted smart dildo with a
[3680.14 --> 3686.94]  whole bunch of kappa faces you don't think those exist you're crazy anyways there's a tech tip for you
[3686.94 --> 3697.14]  moving on just the tip until AMD form new cross license graphics included yeah that so they've got a new cross cross licensing agreement
[3697.14 --> 3716.92]  basically they've AMD has clarified it a change of control terminates the agreement for both so I think this is more in Intel's interest than anyone else's but if AMD were to be acquired that would be a change in control so Samsung for example
[3716.92 --> 3746.90]  were to acquire AMD which is one of the rumors that's been floating around about AMD and AMD acquisition the cross licensing agreement where AMD and Intel don't pursue patent infringements against each other that allows AMD to produce x86 processors so the kind that runs Windows that goes in computers that would be terminated okay so that's that's pretty much it I mean AMD and Intel cooperate with the
[3746.90 --> 3775.34]  on a much deeper level than most people probably realize and developing standard things is super important yeah I mean if if we lived in a world where we had different applications for AMD processors or Intel processors well it would we basically well it's just funny I was about to say we'd have the same kind of divide between AMD and Intel users as we have between Mac and PC users except we kind of do sad face
[3775.34 --> 3782.34]  speaking of things that we kind of do we kind of do sponsor spots
[3782.34 --> 3794.34]  nice dollar shave club is one of our sponsors today and for those of you who don't know what dollar shave club is they are the reason why my beard doesn't go down to here good for you
[3794.34 --> 3805.32]  it would actually it would I believe you so dollar shave club is the way for to for a few bucks a month if you live in the US Canada New Zealand or all
[3805.34 --> 3816.34]  Australia get high quality razors delivered directly to your door and their marketing materials are actually hilarious have you ever had a look at the actual like cards and and like stuff that's written in your packages
[3816.34 --> 3846.32]  to be honest no it's hilarious they just have like the quirkiest sense of humor ever really awesome writer so they've got all kinds of different stuff up to the six blade executive razor they've got their one wipe Charlie's peppermint scented butt wipes for men they've got their aftershave Dr. Carver they've got their Dr. Carver shave butter which goes on clear so you can see what you're doing while you're doing it and pretty much dollar shave club is one of our longest standing sponsors and I don't think we've ever gotten a
[3846.34 --> 3867.34]  negative comment about them no straight up I have never seen someone say Linus you told us dollar shave club was good I joined the dollar shave club and they killed my mother like I have literally never gotten a message like that or anything negative never mind the mother killing that's probably good so dollar shave club dot com slash Linus to join the club and start shaving time and shaving
[3867.34 --> 3896.34]  money money money speaking of money Mastrop a place where you can buy not razors see how we have non conflicting sponsors there although Mastrop does have just a metric buttload of stuff so today at dro.ps slash wanshow I'm gonna show you guys this this is a ducky shine for special community edition
[3896.34 --> 3905.22]  you can see they wanted a hundred sold and this blew so many people away that two hundred and eighty one of them I believe they are
[3905.22 --> 3914.68]  go away two hundred and eighty one of them were sold for one hundred sixty nine ninety nine now that is a pretty darn expensive
[3914.68 --> 3926.28]  little number but but this is a pretty darn fancy little keyboard so the community and Matt 30 designed the next
[3926.28 --> 3949.24]  special edition ducky shine for with the stipulation that the keyboard would have multiple switches so the silent feeler layout with cherry MX clears and cherry MX browns was the winner so you'll have your choice of laser engraved blue and gray PBT keycaps or blank blue and gray PBT keycaps and the drop is limited to five hundred units
[3949.24 --> 3977.24]  yeah boy that is so sick so pretty much the rundown on Mastrop is all kinds of stuff like this they'll get community sourced deals they'll source things from manufacturers directly themselves and the way it works is the more people buy the more everyone saves they've got everything from I think I've got a knife that we got from Mastrop they had that like that weird head pillow that we showed off on the WAN show before where you just put it around your head and then you just lay on things to sleep
[3977.24 --> 4005.24]  I think it's around here somewhere I should take it to Taiwan if you just want to kind of shop for kitschy cool stuff Mastrop.com or if you are interested in that ducky shine deal particularly drawdups slash WAN show and then our last sponsor of the day these guys never go away they just keep making people's websites better for a very reasonable charge
[4005.24 --> 4035.06]  squarespace.com it starts at eight dollars a month with scalable beautiful website templates whether you want to do a blog a store I always use the same examples let's come up with other websites people could build a conspiracy info site yes if you were like a dog dating site if you were like GTX 480s don't melt steel beams you could make a website about that you could make a website like that you could make you could make an online
[4035.06 --> 4059.88]  profile for your dog for your dog for dating purposes you could make a no not for you to date the dog for your dog to date that's what yeah people breed dogs is it any different like a dating thing you have a profile like I like hikes and sniffing butts some people date just for the action it could be like things that I enjoy and then just like a column of food and like a column of butts no I ain't on this thing I love
[4059.88 --> 4089.74]  a whole column of partially opened doors with like a shoe coming through so so squarespace makes your site responsive both in terms of how quickly it's it's how quickly you can navigate on it because it's hosted over on squarespace's servers as well as responsive in terms of responsive design so it looks great on a phone it looks great on a larger screen or whatever the case may be and regardless of your skill level so if you're very entry level you can just do it all pretty much through a GUI and
[4089.74 --> 4119.72]  if you're a little more advanced then you can start to tinker with things you can go ahead and build the site that you want to build and when you decide to sign up for squarespace when you abandon that wordpress site or whatever it is you're using now guys use offer code linus to save 10% on squarespace.com that applies to if you buy an entire year at a time you will get 10% off that entire whack not to mention that if you buy an entire year at a time you get your domain name thrown in for free so if it's one that's available like
[4119.72 --> 4149.72]  regular price domain they will throw that into your yearly subscription squarespace build it beautiful thank you for that I got it all right so what else what else do we got here we've got there must be other things which are three tweak tool oh yeah so we were kind of like talking about how they were gonna do cool stuff is this from them officially or is this someone else releasing this um doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop
[4149.72 --> 4157.44]  was Blue4, and the original site here is dsogaming.com.
[4158.04 --> 4158.56]  I have to skip it.
[4158.56 --> 4159.40]  I had two of them.
[4159.42 --> 4160.66]  I have never seen that before.
[4160.76 --> 4161.18]  Two of them?
[4161.32 --> 4164.56]  Yeah, I had to skip two full-page takeover ads.
[4164.66 --> 4164.80]  Yeah.
[4165.08 --> 4166.06]  That is interesting.
[4166.14 --> 4168.06]  I think they know a lot of people are looking at this article.
[4168.24 --> 4173.12]  Must-have tool gives you easy access to extensive options.
[4173.70 --> 4179.06]  So while the developers, while CD Projekt Red did give gamers the ability,
[4179.06 --> 4183.34]  with the latest patch, to go into the INI files and tweak a bunch of settings,
[4184.14 --> 4187.12]  Modern Melectaus, I'm not even going to try,
[4187.32 --> 4190.62]  has released a configuration tool that allows you to easily gain access
[4190.62 --> 4195.48]  to numerous graphics options without doing text editing.
[4195.88 --> 4197.36]  Very, very cool stuff.
[4197.84 --> 4203.06]  It includes support for SweetFX, and you can basically download it here.
[4203.84 --> 4205.32]  Did you post this link in the Twitch chat?
[4205.34 --> 4205.44]  I did.
[4205.58 --> 4206.68]  It looks really nice.
[4207.02 --> 4208.02]  I think it's pretty cool.
[4208.02 --> 4209.34]  Actually, we've got to look at the...
[4209.34 --> 4214.40]  The funny thing is, it looks about the same as the actual configuration options
[4214.40 --> 4216.04]  for a lot of games that I've seen.
[4216.56 --> 4218.98]  So you can do things like change object count trigger.
[4219.38 --> 4220.20]  Wow, there's all...
[4220.20 --> 4220.88]  Wow!
[4221.86 --> 4225.36]  Maximum visibility depth, sharpening amounts, everything.
[4225.68 --> 4229.08]  You guys can play around with it all you freaking want.
[4229.16 --> 4229.86]  Very cool.
[4229.86 --> 4231.02]  Have fun, Rhinus.
[4231.02 --> 4232.28]  Yeah, have fun indeed.
[4232.28 --> 4233.16]  When you're doing that thing.
[4234.06 --> 4235.20]  I'm not doing that thing.
[4235.52 --> 4236.22]  You kind of are.
[4236.68 --> 4238.28]  No, I'm just...
[4238.28 --> 4239.76]  I'm using whatever settings you're using.
[4240.26 --> 4241.12]  Oh, it's not ready.
[4241.70 --> 4242.06]  Oh.
[4242.60 --> 4243.94]  Well, I'll figure it out then.
[4243.94 --> 4245.78]  I'm probably not going to tinker with this too much.
[4245.82 --> 4246.10]  Yeah.
[4246.34 --> 4247.16]  To be perfectly honest.
[4247.16 --> 4248.58]  You probably don't have to use that at all.
[4248.84 --> 4249.24]  Okay.
[4249.24 --> 4255.48]  Backtrack 5 was the Linux OS thing distribution that I was talking about a long time ago
[4255.48 --> 4257.72]  that most people aren't going to know this reference for, but anyways, moving on.
[4258.30 --> 4259.16]  This is hilarious.
[4259.26 --> 4260.86]  This was posted by Twisted Dictator.
[4260.94 --> 4262.64]  The original article here is from The Verge.
[4263.08 --> 4268.78]  Chinese tech exec spends $100 million to create Star Trek-inspired offices.
[4271.88 --> 4272.84]  That's awesome.
[4273.30 --> 4274.88]  This is the stupidest thing ever.
[4275.00 --> 4275.32]  No!
[4276.02 --> 4276.50]  Yes.
[4276.64 --> 4276.94]  No.
[4277.02 --> 4277.38]  Yes.
[4277.48 --> 4277.72]  No.
[4277.78 --> 4278.08]  Yes.
[4278.16 --> 4279.18]  We're talking about it.
[4279.44 --> 4280.10]  That's true.
[4280.18 --> 4281.80]  We're talking about it because it's ridiculous.
[4282.10 --> 4282.32]  So?
[4283.12 --> 4284.18]  What if someone's like...
[4284.18 --> 4286.46]  What if someone's like, I don't like my job.
[4286.68 --> 4290.02]  I want to go work in a space station that happens to be on the ground and can't go to
[4290.02 --> 4290.34]  space.
[4291.00 --> 4293.48]  And doesn't even look that much like the Starship Enterprise.
[4293.68 --> 4296.82]  Just like vaguely a similar shape, not even the same.
[4296.82 --> 4299.92]  Like if I didn't tell you that's the USS Enterprise.
[4300.74 --> 4302.40]  Did I just put an extra S in there?
[4302.54 --> 4303.08]  Man, I'm tired.
[4303.14 --> 4303.50]  USS.
[4305.06 --> 4308.10]  I wouldn't be too surprised if I was like, huh!
[4308.10 --> 4310.00]  It kind of looks like a similar shape.
[4310.24 --> 4313.14]  But I wouldn't be like, that is the Enterprise.
[4314.34 --> 4315.46]  Because, I don't know.
[4315.62 --> 4316.30]  There's problems.
[4316.48 --> 4319.24]  Like, isn't the height differential not even like that?
[4319.82 --> 4320.26]  Yeah, no.
[4320.36 --> 4320.98]  It's like a...
[4320.98 --> 4321.28]  Isn't it more aggressive?
[4321.46 --> 4322.06]  It's like a...
[4322.06 --> 4322.22]  Yeah.
[4322.28 --> 4323.02]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[4323.16 --> 4324.76]  It's like a mushed Enterprise.
[4325.02 --> 4325.12]  Yeah.
[4325.12 --> 4326.58]  It's like if the Enterprise crashed.
[4326.66 --> 4327.28]  It's like...
[4327.28 --> 4329.44]  Oh, come on.
[4329.44 --> 4333.80]  Did you just search for USS Enterprise and it came up with a naval ship?
[4334.44 --> 4336.26]  That's really a more common search.
[4337.00 --> 4338.20]  Oh, I missed an S.
[4340.14 --> 4342.80]  Oh, there we go.
[4343.24 --> 4344.12]  Yeah, because okay.
[4344.62 --> 4345.98]  And like it doesn't have the bottom thing.
[4347.42 --> 4347.80]  Wow.
[4348.48 --> 4348.92]  Lagging.
[4349.46 --> 4350.10]  There we go.
[4350.76 --> 4351.34]  There we go.
[4351.34 --> 4354.02]  So we'll pull up some images of the Starship Enterprise.
[4354.28 --> 4355.68]  See, aircraft carrier was the first thing.
[4356.24 --> 4357.12]  Oh, that's true.
[4357.12 --> 4357.28]  And right there.
[4357.46 --> 4357.88]  That's true.
[4358.40 --> 4359.10]  What is that?
[4359.42 --> 4360.64]  I don't know what this one is.
[4361.42 --> 4361.98]  I actually...
[4361.98 --> 4362.32]  You know what?
[4362.38 --> 4367.94]  Probably the only one I would recognize just by looking at it is the Next Generation one.
[4368.50 --> 4369.56]  I don't even see it here.
[4371.02 --> 4371.38]  Wow.
[4371.56 --> 4375.24]  Either way, I think there's more height differential and there's a thing below it, which is obviously
[4375.24 --> 4376.04]  not being shown.
[4376.04 --> 4383.02]  And like the big saucer part is supposed to just be kind of connected by like a little
[4383.02 --> 4383.36]  thing.
[4383.48 --> 4383.88]  That's it.
[4384.78 --> 4385.12]  Yeah.
[4386.38 --> 4387.60]  That's Next Generation, right?
[4388.08 --> 4388.60]  I don't know.
[4388.68 --> 4389.12]  Maybe not.
[4389.34 --> 4390.80]  I was never much of a Trekkie.
[4390.84 --> 4392.86]  I was probably much less than you were.
[4393.06 --> 4393.74]  No, really.
[4393.74 --> 4394.04]  I never watched TV.
[4394.46 --> 4394.80]  Right?
[4395.06 --> 4397.06]  I've seen maybe one episode of Star Trek.
[4397.18 --> 4398.30]  Sorry for people that now hate me.
[4398.46 --> 4398.86]  Really?
[4399.08 --> 4399.30]  Yeah.
[4400.76 --> 4401.16]  Really?
[4401.22 --> 4402.42]  My dad really liked it.
[4402.42 --> 4405.76]  But then I never watched TV, so I've just never really seen it.
[4405.76 --> 4406.80]  Have you seen like the new movies?
[4407.92 --> 4409.42]  I've seen one of them, I think.
[4409.56 --> 4409.60]  Really?
[4409.60 --> 4410.84]  I also don't watch that many movies.
[4412.32 --> 4413.74]  I'm slowly getting into it.
[4413.80 --> 4416.74]  Like I'm trying to catch up on things that I missed when I was a kid by watching Netflix
[4416.74 --> 4418.04]  and watching all these other stuff.
[4418.54 --> 4420.92]  Because they're better than The Hobbit and you saw all three of those.
[4421.28 --> 4424.58]  Well, my family's always been really hardcore into Lord of the Rings because I read the books.
[4425.40 --> 4425.72]  Right.
[4426.36 --> 4426.68]  Yeah.
[4426.92 --> 4427.28]  I see.
[4427.28 --> 4430.28]  We were never really a hardcore like TV and movies family.
[4431.12 --> 4431.48]  How fast are you?
[4431.48 --> 4435.30]  I'm trying to catch up on things and I'm sure I'll end up watching Star Trek, but it's just
[4435.30 --> 4437.86]  like, yeah, going through the motions.
[4438.40 --> 4440.12]  The chat hates me right now.
[4440.22 --> 4440.64]  I bet they do.
[4440.64 --> 4441.66]  I'm just being honest.
[4442.30 --> 4446.22]  I could lie and be like, oh, yeah, that's the ship.
[4447.22 --> 4450.48]  But that would just be stupid.
[4450.88 --> 4452.44]  Do we have any other rapid fire stuff?
[4452.64 --> 4455.40]  Oh, Amazon expands their same day delivery.
[4455.84 --> 4456.14]  What's up?
[4456.22 --> 4457.74]  Text message that shuts off people's iPhones.
[4457.80 --> 4458.14]  Oh, yeah.
[4458.20 --> 4458.84]  That's pretty funny.
[4458.84 --> 4459.36]  That's hilarious.
[4460.08 --> 4460.82]  Oh, my God.
[4460.84 --> 4461.40]  Who posted that?
[4463.36 --> 4464.12]  Sir Numbers.
[4464.30 --> 4464.84]  Sir Numbers.
[4465.38 --> 4466.92]  This was posted by Victoria's Secret.
[4467.08 --> 4469.24]  Amazon has expanded their same day delivery.
[4469.38 --> 4473.60]  So orders submitted by noon will arrive by 9 p.m. that day.
[4473.74 --> 4474.14]  Holy crap.
[4474.14 --> 4478.08]  So the region has previously allowed New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta,
[4478.22 --> 4481.90]  Boston, Baltimore, Dallas, Fort Worth, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.,
[4481.90 --> 4485.26]  and it has now been expanded to San Diego and Tampa Bay.
[4485.48 --> 4489.64]  The price is now free on orders over $35 for Prime customers.
[4490.20 --> 4491.06]  Holy balls.
[4491.18 --> 4492.28]  And so Prime's $100 a year.
[4492.74 --> 4497.04]  And it was previously a flat fee of $5.99 for all Prime customers.
[4497.50 --> 4504.04]  Non-members will continue to pay $9 plus $1 per unit when requesting same day delivery.
[4504.72 --> 4508.96]  So separate from Prime now, which is one-hour deliveries in New York City, Miami, Baltimore,
[4509.12 --> 4512.04]  Dallas, Atlanta, and Austin to Prime members for $7.99.
[4512.70 --> 4513.84]  One-hour delivery.
[4514.24 --> 4515.64]  Holy balls.
[4515.64 --> 4517.08]  Does that even work?
[4517.76 --> 4519.36]  Amazon is a machine, man.
[4519.46 --> 4520.40]  How do you move that quickly?
[4520.66 --> 4522.18]  Amazon is a machine.
[4523.54 --> 4525.06]  This was posted by Amming.
[4525.06 --> 4532.62]  If one country, if one company was to, say like 100 years from now, corporations are essentially
[4532.62 --> 4534.96]  countries at this point, because we're getting close to that anyways.
[4536.24 --> 4541.12]  Like, if someone had to run the whole world, who would you think would do it best?
[4542.42 --> 4546.46]  I have always said, I can't pick one, because I'm going to stick to my guns.
[4546.60 --> 4547.82]  This is what I've always said.
[4548.62 --> 4552.20]  A Costco and Amazon merger would take care of everything I could ever need.
[4552.20 --> 4552.56]  Yeah.
[4552.56 --> 4555.08]  Yeah.
[4555.26 --> 4558.18]  If I had to pick one, I was saying Amazon.
[4558.70 --> 4559.34]  You'd go Amazon?
[4559.74 --> 4559.94]  Costco?
[4559.94 --> 4561.26]  No, I was saying likeliness.
[4561.34 --> 4562.64]  Costco has better ethics.
[4562.80 --> 4563.46]  Oh, I see.
[4563.72 --> 4563.82]  Okay.
[4563.82 --> 4563.94]  Yeah.
[4564.18 --> 4565.86]  I would prefer Costco ran everything.
[4566.22 --> 4566.50]  Yeah.
[4566.92 --> 4567.14]  Yeah.
[4567.40 --> 4571.40]  It's like ginormous jar of pickles for all.
[4571.66 --> 4572.02]  Yeah.
[4572.42 --> 4576.28]  Everyone would be paid well, but there wouldn't really be a lot of variance in like what you
[4576.28 --> 4577.02]  get to eat and stuff.
[4577.16 --> 4577.52]  Yeah.
[4577.84 --> 4579.14]  But you'd have a lot of it.
[4579.50 --> 4580.00]  You'd have time.
[4580.00 --> 4582.34]  If one would have like an industrial jar of pickles.
[4582.52 --> 4582.74]  Yeah.
[4583.14 --> 4584.00]  An industrial jar.
[4584.00 --> 4585.46]  What industry uses pickles?
[4585.56 --> 4585.82]  Shut up.
[4586.52 --> 4587.76]  Oh, well, food industry.
[4588.24 --> 4588.64]  Shut up.
[4590.08 --> 4591.14]  It's been a long week.
[4591.14 --> 4594.02]  I'm just like, what?
[4594.76 --> 4597.18]  Well, you know those like giant jars of pickles that we have.
[4597.18 --> 4598.96]  I know what you meant by industrial jar of pickles.
[4599.04 --> 4599.34]  I hate you.
[4599.36 --> 4603.88]  Every week you'd get like two of those like giant trough boxes of chicken.
[4605.38 --> 4606.54]  A trough box?
[4606.80 --> 4607.20]  Okay.
[4607.20 --> 4607.78]  That's what I call that.
[4607.78 --> 4610.72]  Somebody please invent the trough box.
[4610.78 --> 4611.08]  Okay.
[4611.42 --> 4612.66]  So this has to be a takeout.
[4612.68 --> 4613.84]  Go to Costco and check out my chicken.
[4613.84 --> 4614.24]  No, no, no.
[4614.24 --> 4620.00]  It's a takeout container in the shape of an elongated bowl with a lid on it.
[4620.06 --> 4620.24]  Right?
[4620.24 --> 4620.32]  Right?
[4620.54 --> 4625.20]  But it's like, it like folds at the bottom and has like a little wire handle like a Chinese
[4625.20 --> 4626.02]  takeout box.
[4626.64 --> 4631.78]  So you take off the like handle and like maybe it folds down to the bottom so it doesn't drip
[4631.78 --> 4634.06]  through or something and that is the trough box.
[4634.22 --> 4637.36]  You literally work your way across and shovel the food into your mouth.
[4637.66 --> 4638.22]  Trough box.
[4638.40 --> 4639.00]  You're a genius.
[4639.62 --> 4639.96]  All right.
[4640.14 --> 4645.02]  So Google Maps, Chrome, and YouTube offline support extended in a big way.
[4645.14 --> 4646.86]  Google Maps is a huge one for me.
[4646.86 --> 4647.14]  Yeah.
[4647.14 --> 4652.16]  It is such a pain in the ass to deal with when you're traveling and you don't have a roaming
[4652.16 --> 4652.88]  data plan or something.
[4652.96 --> 4656.96]  It's like, well, if I could just load a bunch of this up on Wi-Fi and then maybe it would
[4656.96 --> 4658.78]  somewhat work and boopity boopity.
[4659.02 --> 4659.66]  Like, they're...
[4659.66 --> 4660.18]  Hold up.
[4660.22 --> 4661.02]  I'm going to pause you for a second.
[4661.18 --> 4664.50]  Some of the Twitch chat just said, you two are so stupid it's unreal.
[4664.82 --> 4667.12]  You have not seen Scrapyard Wars 2 yet.
[4667.12 --> 4667.56]  Wow.
[4668.00 --> 4669.52]  It is a whole other level of unreal.
[4669.72 --> 4671.08]  You have no idea.
[4671.26 --> 4672.84]  Your reality will collapse.
[4673.22 --> 4676.38]  The reality you already have will be gone.
[4678.12 --> 4679.68]  What else can I really...
[4679.68 --> 4681.70]  What else can I really even say?
[4683.74 --> 4684.58]  That's cool, though.
[4685.00 --> 4688.34]  So the new version of Chrome and Android will allow you to save a web page for offline viewing.
[4688.58 --> 4688.76]  Cool.
[4688.84 --> 4691.06]  We'll include turn-by-turn directions offline.
[4691.34 --> 4691.64]  Wow.
[4691.64 --> 4695.90]  YouTube will allow you to keep a video saved offline for 48 hours and will be available
[4695.90 --> 4699.08]  to all Android 4.4 devices or higher in the near future.
[4699.54 --> 4701.64]  And Maps will have an offline mode.
[4701.74 --> 4704.06]  You will have to download the Maps you choose to use offline.
[4704.20 --> 4705.20]  But come on.
[4705.26 --> 4706.86]  How did this take so long?
[4706.92 --> 4708.68]  How long has Nokia had this?
[4714.76 --> 4716.04]  So frustrating.
[4716.86 --> 4719.78]  But that'll be coming sometime later this year.
[4719.78 --> 4721.08]  Zotac.
[4721.46 --> 4722.00]  And apparently...
[4722.00 --> 4723.86]  You requested a sample of this, right?
[4727.06 --> 4728.06]  Is that in this?
[4728.12 --> 4729.44]  Is that in this news article?
[4729.64 --> 4731.20]  Is the one that I've reviewed?
[4731.20 --> 4733.02]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4733.08 --> 4734.16]  Titan, Titan X, Titan X.
[4735.28 --> 4738.08]  You requested a sample of the Titan X with the Arctic Storm.
[4740.98 --> 4741.34]  Okay.
[4741.84 --> 4747.36]  Titan X with an aftermarket cooler, with a non-reference cooler.
[4747.42 --> 4747.86]  I super want it.
[4747.98 --> 4749.42]  And I'm so happy this exists.
[4749.42 --> 4750.92]  And I told you about this.
[4751.20 --> 4753.28]  But because on the Titan X video, when I'm like,
[4753.56 --> 4756.24]  Oh, I really hope that someone makes an aftermarket cooler.
[4756.54 --> 4758.48]  And everyone was like,
[4758.54 --> 4759.54]  You're such an idiot.
[4759.68 --> 4761.30]  They'd never do that for Titans.
[4761.56 --> 4762.00]  Rawr.
[4762.12 --> 4762.98]  But like, I'm thinking,
[4763.20 --> 4764.66]  This one is way hotter.
[4765.72 --> 4767.70]  Average running temperature than all the other ones.
[4767.74 --> 4768.36]  So it's possible.
[4768.86 --> 4770.90]  Thank you, Zotac, for doing such a thing.
[4771.10 --> 4772.60]  So I'm trying to get them to send me one.
[4772.80 --> 4773.76]  I actually recommend,
[4773.86 --> 4775.60]  If you want to see our video on how good it is,
[4775.60 --> 4776.42]  Go like,
[4777.80 --> 4778.88]  Go after Zotac.
[4779.46 --> 4779.88]  And be like,
[4779.94 --> 4780.16]  Hey,
[4781.06 --> 4782.50]  Send Linus Tech Tips a freaking card.
[4782.92 --> 4783.76]  So they can bench it.
[4783.80 --> 4786.54]  The Arctic Storm is a hybrid cooled card.
[4786.54 --> 4789.64]  So it actually has both air and liquid cooling.
[4789.88 --> 4791.24]  So it has threads, I believe.
[4791.58 --> 4791.78]  Yep.
[4791.78 --> 4794.96]  So this is very similar to the Asus Poseidon.
[4795.02 --> 4795.74]  I believe they did a,
[4795.76 --> 4796.08]  What was it?
[4796.08 --> 4797.60]  A 980 Poseidon?
[4798.16 --> 4800.54]  Or was it a 700 series?
[4800.70 --> 4801.70]  I don't remember.
[4801.70 --> 4802.70]  780.
[4802.70 --> 4803.14]  780.
[4803.56 --> 4804.00]  780.
[4804.18 --> 4805.96]  It was a GTX 780 Poseidon.
[4805.98 --> 4807.54]  He didn't remember 960s existed.
[4808.08 --> 4809.58]  Yes, there's a Poseidon 980.
[4809.80 --> 4810.24]  Oh, okay.
[4810.54 --> 4811.70]  Is there a 780 too?
[4811.98 --> 4812.40]  I think so.
[4812.40 --> 4812.68]  Help me.
[4812.76 --> 4813.02]  Help me.
[4813.02 --> 4813.24]  I think so.
[4813.36 --> 4813.76]  I think so.
[4813.94 --> 4815.10]  Please confirm for me.
[4815.14 --> 4817.32]  Because my brain might have completely fallen out my ear
[4817.32 --> 4818.40]  While I was sleeping last night.
[4818.48 --> 4818.66]  Okay.
[4818.90 --> 4819.30]  Good.
[4819.30 --> 4821.30]  So there's a 780 Poseidon.
[4821.40 --> 4823.18]  This has been done before.
[4823.56 --> 4827.62]  Cooler Master had a cooler that went on the GTX,
[4827.70 --> 4831.78]  Or the 8800 GTX, or 8800 Ultra, way back in the day.
[4832.14 --> 4833.12]  Forget what that thing was called.
[4833.20 --> 4834.52]  I reviewed it for Hardware Canucks.
[4836.24 --> 4838.32]  So it's not a new concept by any stretch,
[4838.44 --> 4839.80]  But very cool stuff.
[4840.18 --> 4842.52]  AMD has an It's Coming teaser.
[4843.04 --> 4848.16]  I feel like we're just shoveling coal into the hype machine at this point.
[4848.16 --> 4849.16]  Copy text!
[4849.90 --> 4853.08]  We might as well just show you guys what's here.
[4853.32 --> 4854.62]  I'm trying to catch up on the links, guys.
[4854.70 --> 4856.98]  We're just bouncing all over the place, and it's hard to keep track of.
[4856.98 --> 4858.92]  So this was posted by Epic Pwnage,
[4859.50 --> 4863.38]  And basically, it's a graphics card, for those of you who didn't clue into that.
[4864.42 --> 4867.54]  If any of the rumors circulating are correct,
[4867.60 --> 4870.76]  It'll be some kind of 390 series graphics card.
[4871.24 --> 4874.36]  You mean those rumors that have been circulating for like 6 months?
[4874.48 --> 4876.92]  Ever since AMD started them?
[4876.92 --> 4877.26]  Yeah.
[4878.34 --> 4881.24]  It's like, we have no response to 980.
[4881.76 --> 4882.52]  What should we do?
[4884.78 --> 4886.74]  Let's tell people to wait for 390X.
[4887.34 --> 4890.96]  All I can say, AMD, is if you're gonna do that,
[4891.42 --> 4892.70]  If that's gonna be your strategy,
[4893.24 --> 4894.34]  It better be good.
[4894.48 --> 4896.12]  I got no problem with the hype machine,
[4896.78 --> 4898.66]  If you come through for me.
[4898.80 --> 4899.86]  Can you tell the story again?
[4900.28 --> 4900.76]  Which story?
[4901.12 --> 4902.96]  I'm not gonna, oh, come on!
[4903.12 --> 4904.28]  I want to go to sleep.
[4904.28 --> 4905.48]  No, no, no.
[4905.70 --> 4906.16]  That's a bad time story?
[4907.28 --> 4907.64]  Wow.
[4908.54 --> 4910.12]  Speaking of going to sleep, guys,
[4910.22 --> 4911.80]  Thank you very much for tuning in.
[4912.24 --> 4914.30]  And this show is going to sleep.
[4914.38 --> 4916.38]  I'm sorry there will be no after party today,
[4916.74 --> 4918.90]  Because I gotta bail.
[4919.00 --> 4919.84]  I got some stuff to do.
[4919.90 --> 4920.86]  He's got some stuff to do.
[4920.92 --> 4922.70]  It's been a heck of a week.
[4922.80 --> 4924.22]  Thank you very much for tuning in.
[4924.30 --> 4926.42]  All over 6,000 of you.
[4926.46 --> 4927.18]  You guys are awesome.
[4927.48 --> 4928.04]  We'll see you again.
[4928.16 --> 4929.66]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[4929.66 --> 4930.92]  Except he won't be here.
[4931.36 --> 4931.56]  Yeah.
[4931.70 --> 4932.82]  Because he'll be in Taiwan.
[4934.14 --> 4935.48]  I don't think that's realistic.
[4936.06 --> 4936.62]  Is it?
[4937.08 --> 4937.58]  I don't know.
[4937.70 --> 4938.60]  It depends what time it is.
[4938.60 --> 4939.14]  What time it is.
[4940.18 --> 4940.76]  Hold on.
[4940.86 --> 4941.48]  I have no idea.
[4941.48 --> 4944.74]  6 a.m. is 3 p.m. the previous day.
[4945.24 --> 4947.70]  So 6 p.m. would be 3 a.m. the previous day.
[4948.28 --> 4951.54]  So it would be like 1.30 in the morning the previous day.
[4951.62 --> 4952.88]  I don't think that makes a ton of sense.
[4953.12 --> 4955.24]  I usually stay up to like 4 when I'm at shows.
[4956.26 --> 4957.42]  It'll depend on the day.
[4957.62 --> 4958.60]  I'm not gonna guarantee it.
[4958.60 --> 4959.82]  If you get another guest then sure.
[4960.20 --> 4962.14]  But if you don't have another guest I can probably.
[4962.42 --> 4964.78]  Maybe I'll bring on Austin without broken audio.
[4965.82 --> 4967.34]  I'll show you right up.
[4968.28 --> 4968.72]  Alright.
[4969.02 --> 4970.14]  That wasn't even my fault.
[4970.16 --> 4970.78]  Peace guys.
[4970.92 --> 4971.44]  Peace guys.
[4971.46 --> 4972.52]  I'm sorry Austin.
[4975.86 --> 4978.18]  I was really worried we were dropping frames at the beginning.
[4978.40 --> 4979.56]  I was like oh yeah the YouTube update.
[4979.96 --> 4980.20]  Oh.
[4980.56 --> 4981.88]  But we haven't dropped a frame since then.
[4983.32 --> 4985.18]  Oh my goodness it's so hot in here.
[4985.18 --> 4990.32]  It's like straight horrible.
[4991.64 --> 4995.70]  I'm happy to see that people are tweeting Zotac to send me that card.
[4995.86 --> 4996.96]  Thanks for watching guys.
[4997.18 --> 4998.62]  Thank you to Squarespace.
[4999.30 --> 5000.40]  And Mask Drop.
[5000.90 --> 5002.04]  If it goes up there.
[5002.14 --> 5002.54]  Yeah.
[5002.72 --> 5003.56]  And Dollar Shave Club.
[5003.70 --> 5005.78]  They all have different looking title cards.
[5005.92 --> 5006.48]  Thanks everyone.
[5006.92 --> 5007.28]  Bye.
[5007.28 --> 5007.38]  Bye.
[5007.38 --> 5007.48]  Bye.
[5007.48 --> 5007.50]  Bye.

[5007.68 --> 5007.72]  Bye.
[5007.72 --> 5007.74]  Bye.
[5007.74 --> 5007.76]  Bye.
[5007.76 --> 5007.78]  Bye.
[5007.78 --> 5007.80]  Bye.
[5007.80 --> 5007.84]  Bye.
[5007.84 --> 5007.90]  Bye.
[5007.90 --> 5007.92]  Bye.
[5007.92 --> 5007.94]  Bye.
[5007.94 --> 5008.36]  Bye.
[5008.36 --> 5008.76]  Bye.
[5008.76 --> 5008.84]  Bye.
[5008.84 --> 5008.94]  Bye.
[5008.94 --> 5009.36]  Bye.
[5009.36 --> 5009.80]  Bye.
[5009.80 --> 5009.84]  Bye.
[5009.84 --> 5009.94]  Bye.
[5009.94 --> 5010.84]  Bye.
[5010.84 --> 5010.90]  Bye.
[5010.90 --> 5010.94]  Bye.
[5010.94 --> 5011.40]  Bye.
[5011.40 --> 5011.84]  Bye.
