[0.00 → 5.44] All right, so I believe we are live now.
[5.44 → 5.94] Woo!
[5.94 → 6.94] Hopefully a lot of this thing is ready.
[6.94 → 7.94] Woo!
[7.94 → 8.94] Hello, everybody.
[8.94 → 11.72] Wow, the lower third is not above you.
[11.72 → 12.72] Now it is.
[12.72 → 13.72] Hooray!
[13.72 → 19.62] Anyway, we have a bunch of cool stuff, including one entire full unit of a bucket
[19.62 → 21.44] worth of E3 conference announcements.
[21.44 → 25.58] We have R9 300 series release info stuff.
[25.58 → 29.76] We also have the R9 Fury series release info stuff.
[29.76 → 32.70] We have no performance benchmarks for you guys yet.
[32.70 → 36.26] The performance embargo for Fury is lifting.
[36.26 → 37.26] Not yet.
[37.26 → 40.00] I think it's under embargo when the embargo is up, or maybe it isn't.
[40.00 → 41.00] I don't know.
[41.00 → 43.32] I guess you'll have to watch the show to find out, or you could just Google it.
[43.32 → 44.70] I guess that's fine, too.
[44.70 → 49.22] Also, there's going to be a $150 Xbox controller.
[49.22 → 55.08] What could justify a controller that's worth half as much as the console itself?
[55.08 → 56.08] I guess we'll find out.
[56.08 → 59.58] Then that's assuming that you think an Xbox is worth what they charge for it.
[59.58 → 64.52] Are you rolling the intro?
[64.52 → 65.52] Yes!
[65.52 → 70.60] Man, I got no idea what's going on.
[70.60 → 71.86] Oh I'm in a pretty narrow sliver there.
[71.86 → 76.40] I have to try not to lean out of my window.
[76.40 → 77.96] Oh, I'm in a pretty narrow sliver there.
[78.00 → 79.50] I got to try not to lean out of my window.
[80.30 → 80.62] Yeah.
[82.78 → 83.24] All right.
[83.24 → 87.66] Thank you to Linda.com, FreshBooks, and Squarespace.
[89.04 → 89.36] Woo!
[90.40 → 90.80] Squarespace!
[91.90 → 96.04] I like how the scene you're on says no guest because it's actually finally accurate.
[96.62 → 97.70] Because, get it?
[98.32 → 99.82] You're long distance, but you're not a guest.
[99.96 → 101.20] Anyway, that was terrible.
[102.00 → 102.40] Right.
[102.50 → 103.34] I am not a guest.
[103.42 → 103.72] You're right.
[103.78 → 104.52] You did very well.
[104.84 → 105.08] Thank you.
[105.08 → 110.12] I'm waiting until the intro ends so I can figure out where I should be positioned.
[110.12 → 110.30] You're fine.
[110.30 → 110.90] My head.
[110.90 → 111.34] You're good.
[111.54 → 113.68] You're right in the right spot right now.
[113.82 → 115.52] Maybe if you lean back slightly.
[115.84 → 117.38] Lean back slightly and a little harder?
[117.38 → 118.46] I'm probably more improperly...
[118.46 → 123.24] I'm probably worse positioned than you are right now, so no big deal.
[123.50 → 126.60] Have you read into any of the E3 news?
[127.68 → 128.12] Yeah.
[128.32 → 129.08] Any of the game announcements?
[129.26 → 129.72] Okay, cool.
[129.82 → 130.62] Yeah, a little bit.
[131.24 → 134.80] One of the ones that looks really cool to me, and I want to preface this,
[135.08 → 143.78] with that E3 announcements are complete horseshit, and we shouldn't really care at all about anything that they said.
[144.00 → 144.18] Yeah.
[144.18 → 152.40] But, um, South Park, the fractured butthole, I really want to be excited about, but I think is probably going to be garbage.
[153.02 → 153.96] Because dev by FBI?
[153.96 → 156.58] Uh, I didn't say that.
[156.66 → 157.46] I didn't say that.
[157.62 → 157.94] You know?
[158.08 → 159.74] I got a lot of friends who work at FBI.
[159.84 → 160.36] No, I don't.
[162.66 → 163.14] That's why.
[163.80 → 164.20] Why?
[164.38 → 165.18] I mean, I don't.
[165.30 → 166.96] It always kind of...
[167.76 → 168.74] It's like...
[168.74 → 170.14] How do I put this?
[170.14 → 178.42] It's like if I came up with the concept of us having, like, a great YouTube video, and I have you make it, and it's perfect.
[178.80 → 181.52] And then I'm like, wow, that was so successful.
[181.84 → 183.36] Let's make another YouTube video.
[183.48 → 184.78] I'm going to have someone else do it.
[186.06 → 187.82] Where does this logic come from?
[187.86 → 188.56] Like, I get it.
[188.60 → 190.52] Game studios are busy, or whatever.
[190.52 → 192.86] Or maybe they are charging too much this time.
[192.96 → 195.80] But, like, come on, Parker and Stone.
[195.90 → 197.22] You guys can afford it.
[197.34 → 197.88] Figure it out.
[198.28 → 201.16] Yeah, because South Park was received really well with Stick of Truth.
[201.46 → 201.88] It was.
[201.96 → 203.52] There were some development pitfalls.
[204.54 → 207.12] Like, it was not a smooth development process.
[207.42 → 208.40] But did you play the game?
[209.18 → 210.70] No, but it's always been there.
[210.78 → 213.96] Like, I should probably play this, and I will play it eventually kind of thing.
[213.96 → 214.28] Okay.
[214.64 → 215.52] It is...
[215.52 → 216.38] Wow.
[216.38 → 218.38] Okay, aside from ones that I buy for benchmarking,
[218.38 → 223.98] which, as you know, I can't play because the save games will overwrite
[223.98 → 225.66] because games are ridiculous now.
[226.54 → 227.38] That is...
[228.06 → 228.50] Wow.
[228.72 → 229.52] I don't know.
[229.56 → 230.30] It's been years.
[230.52 → 233.52] I paid $59.99 US for that game.
[233.64 → 235.72] I paid full price.
[236.08 → 240.36] And I waited and waited, and they didn't drop the price,
[240.42 → 243.32] and the reviews were great, and Ed told me it was great.
[243.54 → 245.82] And I was like, come on.
[246.40 → 247.14] Drop the price.
[247.14 → 247.72] And they didn't.
[247.72 → 248.58] And I bought it.
[248.66 → 250.66] I paid full price, and it was worth every penny.
[250.76 → 251.72] I really enjoyed the game.
[252.24 → 253.32] So I want to...
[253.32 → 253.36] That's good to hear.
[254.04 → 254.82] I'm doing it.
[254.88 → 257.60] I'm doing that like, wow, I played the last one, and it was great.
[257.62 → 258.62] I really want to play the next one.
[258.66 → 259.20] I'm doing it.
[259.22 → 262.14] But I'm not going to pre-order it, and I'm going to wait for the reviews.
[262.20 → 262.90] I think that's fine.
[263.36 → 264.76] If you're like, oh, I'm excited.
[264.86 → 267.06] I want to play the next one, but I'm going to wait until it's out.
[267.28 → 268.52] I think that's completely fine.
[268.52 → 271.02] Because I'm super stoked to play Fallout 4.
[271.44 → 271.66] Right.
[271.70 → 272.78] But I haven't pre-ordered it.
[272.96 → 273.42] That's right.
[273.62 → 275.92] Because Bethesda has let you down recently.
[275.92 → 276.12] They have.
[276.12 → 278.04] They were my golden ticket.
[278.44 → 280.18] Every time they released anything, it was fine.
[280.32 → 281.48] And then it was like, oh, it's going online.
[281.80 → 282.20] No!
[282.72 → 284.02] I hate you now.
[284.88 → 285.40] We're done.
[286.06 → 287.82] It was a personal insult to you.
[288.00 → 288.64] It was.
[288.80 → 289.34] It was.
[289.58 → 290.34] I was so mad.
[290.34 → 294.42] Also, the Doom trailer looks like, oh.
[294.84 → 301.90] Like, it looks like cartoon level of, you know, horrible gore, actual just like stupid
[301.90 → 302.38] fun.
[302.62 → 302.80] Yeah.
[302.80 → 304.02] Like, kind of painkillers.
[304.38 → 304.52] Yeah.
[304.52 → 307.44] Um, so I'm, I'm, I'm really liking the Doom trailer.
[307.74 → 310.42] But, I mean, when's the last time it did anything worthwhile?
[310.42 → 315.14] So, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to be a total, total jackass about it.
[315.20 → 318.38] But again, I'll be waiting for, waiting for positive reviews.
[318.90 → 320.58] Um, and then Rise of the Tomb Raider.
[320.72 → 322.34] Oh man, I might even pre-order it.
[322.38 → 324.04] Because, okay, hold on, hold on.
[324.48 → 326.24] Can I, can I, can I sort of, okay.
[326.24 → 328.46] I'm not saying to pre-order the Xbox version.
[328.72 → 333.22] Because it's not coming to PC until some indeterminate amount of time.
[333.22 → 335.60] Okay, so you'll kind of know what the game is all about.
[335.68 → 337.54] Because you'll see the Xbox version first.
[337.86 → 344.64] But, but, Crystal Dynamics did a perfect job of the PC port of Tomb Raider 2013.
[345.18 → 346.44] I loved that game.
[346.60 → 347.74] I really enjoyed it.
[347.98 → 350.84] That, but more of it, please, would be great.
[350.84 → 357.16] Um, and as long as they don't completely mess it up, then I'm, I'm in for, I'm in for Tomb Raider.
[357.36 → 359.32] I heard there's more Tomb Raiding this time.
[360.24 → 361.34] Yeah, that would be good.
[361.38 → 363.84] Because there were, what, like four, four optional tombs?
[364.10 → 367.16] Yeah, yeah, I don't, I don't remember exactly what it was.
[367.22 → 370.12] But it was, it was not even a very big part of the game.
[371.00 → 373.08] Um, another interesting thing.
[373.18 → 374.12] Elder Scrolls Legends.
[374.86 → 378.24] Look, I, I don't think that's going to do much, personally.
[378.24 → 381.96] Just, I would love to think it was going to do great.
[382.06 → 385.08] But just with, with the crushing force that is Hearthstone.
[386.20 → 391.22] Yeah, I, I mean, Hearthstone was, like, that's what Blizzard does.
[391.28 → 396.88] Is they just kind of do something completely stupid that makes no sense.
[397.10 → 402.08] Like, yeah, we're gonna, we're going to throw every, we're going to throw all our weight behind an MMO at a time.
[402.16 → 404.84] When MMOs were, like, really nerdy.
[405.02 → 405.28] Yeah.
[405.34 → 406.62] And they, like, took it mainstream.
[406.62 → 407.06] Yeah.
[407.06 → 415.00] And now it's like, yeah, we're going to take a card game, which is already inherently nerdy, and we are gonna nerd the crap out of it by making it a digital card game.
[415.84 → 417.52] And we are going to wreck everything.
[417.84 → 418.60] And make it mainstream.
[419.02 → 423.42] Just because Blizzard does it don't mean that anyone else can do it, I think, is words to live by.
[423.56 → 423.80] Yeah.
[423.80 → 423.86] Yeah.
[423.86 → 439.18] And speaking of Blizzard, Star Craft 2 Legacy of the Void, I am not particularly excited about finally getting, so they're actually doing a miniseries in between Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void.
[439.18 → 440.60] so it's called Whispers of Oblivion
[440.60 → 443.02] and I haven't actually played
[443.02 → 445.42] any of the Star craft 2 campaign yet
[445.42 → 446.46] embarrassingly enough
[446.46 → 449.40] I actually only even own Wings of Liberty
[449.40 → 451.22] so as much as I'm like
[451.22 → 452.32] way late on this
[452.32 → 454.90] once they've released the whole thing
[454.90 → 456.50] I'm going to just binge play it
[456.50 → 458.06] because I really
[458.06 → 460.92] I know I'm one of those disgusting people
[460.92 → 463.16] who legitimately enjoys RTS
[463.16 → 463.96] storylines
[463.96 → 467.02] I've bought multiple RTS games
[467.02 → 470.06] with zero intention of playing the multiplayer
[470.06 → 473.68] and thinking back on like Red Alert 2
[473.68 → 474.82] even Red Alert 1
[474.82 → 477.82] like I enjoyed the single player
[477.82 → 480.82] Supreme Commander was a great example
[480.82 → 484.00] of a terrible single player campaign implementation
[484.00 → 486.52] because basically you were just
[486.52 → 488.84] it was just like an AI in a spot
[488.84 → 490.50] and a little bit of tech tree
[490.50 → 493.56] like there wasn't even a lot of scripted elements and stuff
[493.56 → 496.24] so it was just kind of bad
[496.24 → 497.18] it was an afterthought
[497.18 → 498.92] but I really enjoyed it
[498.92 → 500.52] so whatever
[500.52 → 501.52] screw you guys
[501.52 → 504.38] I like RTS single player games
[504.38 → 505.06] I really do
[505.06 → 508.18] what else is on here that's interesting
[508.18 → 509.14] Assassin's Creed Syndicate
[509.14 → 511.92] I've lost all faith in that series
[511.92 → 512.66] have you?
[512.80 → 513.10] come on
[513.10 → 514.60] because they've done bad ones before
[514.60 → 517.40] yeah
[517.40 → 518.56] but I'm like
[518.56 → 518.90] come on
[518.90 → 520.58] relatively far behind now
[520.58 → 522.32] I guess so
[522.32 → 523.44] because I haven't played
[523.44 → 525.00] I did not play
[525.00 → 527.12] I can't even remember the name of it
[527.12 → 527.44] Unity
[527.44 → 528.40] I didn't play Unity
[528.40 → 530.56] I didn't play Rogue
[530.56 → 531.62] was it called?
[532.90 → 534.20] and then now Syndicate's coming out
[534.20 → 535.44] and I know almost nothing about it
[535.44 → 536.60] I should try to catch up
[536.60 → 537.12] I've been
[537.12 → 538.96] I was waiting for Unity
[538.96 → 540.02] for patches to come out
[540.02 → 541.38] for it to like fix itself
[541.38 → 541.72] right
[541.72 → 543.68] I shouldn't say itself
[543.68 → 546.06] for developers at FBI to fix it
[546.06 → 549.12] maybe it is now
[549.12 → 549.64] I don't know
[549.64 → 550.98] I'll try it again sometime soon
[550.98 → 551.46] I guess
[551.46 → 552.48] I don't really have a ton of time
[552.48 → 553.40] to play games these days
[553.40 → 554.96] I finally bought CSGO
[554.96 → 555.98] it was on sale
[555.98 → 557.76] it's always on sale
[557.76 → 558.74] well whatever
[558.74 → 559.68] it was on sale
[559.68 → 560.64] and I saw it
[560.64 → 563.04] so I want to play sometime
[563.04 → 564.96] wait like a month or two
[564.96 → 565.98] and then yeah sure
[565.98 → 567.38] and then yeah sure
[567.38 → 569.40] because right after a big sale
[569.40 → 571.64] especially one that CSGO is on
[571.64 → 572.26] but like
[572.26 → 574.96] any time CSGO goes on sale at all
[574.96 → 576.98] there's this like huge wave of hackers
[576.98 → 577.78] oh
[577.78 → 578.60] yeah
[578.60 → 580.30] so just kind of like chill for a sec
[580.30 → 581.66] and then sure
[581.66 → 583.94] well alrighty then
[583.94 → 584.86] I wish I was kidding
[584.86 → 586.08] but I'm not
[586.08 → 587.30] okay
[587.30 → 589.02] Fi rewatch looks super cool
[589.02 → 590.44] and then there's the
[590.44 → 592.38] No Man's Sky conundrum
[592.38 → 594.74] I'm also super excited for COM 2
[594.74 → 596.14] I really liked COM 1
[596.14 → 597.30] I played the crap out of that game
[597.30 → 599.30] so I'm really happy that's coming out
[599.30 → 600.84] hopefully COM 2
[600.84 → 603.04] doesn't have a game breaking glitch
[603.04 → 604.12] halfway through
[604.12 → 605.80] the very last mission of the game
[605.80 → 608.76] when I'm like 32 hours into my campaign
[608.76 → 609.90] that would be really nice
[609.90 → 611.84] Fi rewatch looks super cool
[611.84 → 613.54] I'm worried about it
[613.54 → 614.46] for multiple reasons
[614.46 → 616.18] basically it's a
[616.18 → 618.26] it's a wilderness exploration game
[618.26 → 619.32] essentially
[619.32 → 620.56] and it's an indie game
[620.56 → 621.76] so those two things together
[621.76 → 622.88] scare me a lot
[622.88 → 623.98] so like basically
[623.98 → 627.42] it's a massive expanse of emptiness
[627.42 → 629.48] because they can't afford to
[629.48 → 631.08] dev the assets and environments
[631.08 → 632.38] no we're not talking about
[632.38 → 633.92] No Man's Sky right now
[633.92 → 634.54] oh okay
[634.54 → 635.08] oh wrecked
[635.08 → 636.14] oh wrecked
[636.14 → 636.64] ow
[636.64 → 637.78] oh wrecked
[637.78 → 640.18] you're merciless today
[640.18 → 641.76] you even asked me
[641.76 → 643.04] what my highlights are
[643.04 → 643.88] and then you've just been
[643.88 → 644.76] crapping on everything
[644.76 → 645.42] yeah
[645.42 → 648.08] oh, oh my gosh
[648.08 → 649.72] yeah this isn't in the
[649.72 → 651.18] this isn't in the doc
[651.18 → 653.38] the Final Fantasy 7 remake
[653.38 → 654.50] oh wow
[654.50 → 655.66] which I am totally
[655.66 → 657.86] pissed off about
[657.86 → 659.70] because you want 6 right
[659.70 → 660.32] because yeah
[660.32 → 662.12] because why does 7
[662.12 → 664.12] get all of this attention
[664.12 → 666.00] why does everyone
[666.00 → 668.04] just have this massive erection
[668.04 → 669.38] for Final Fantasy 7
[669.38 → 672.30] it is not the best game
[672.30 → 673.84] I would argue that 6
[673.84 → 674.90] well no not I would argue
[674.90 → 675.80] 6 is
[675.80 → 676.72] superior
[676.72 → 679.34] I would argue that 5 is superior
[679.34 → 681.40] and I could even make arguments
[681.40 → 682.00] for 9
[682.00 → 682.76] although I don't know
[682.76 → 683.52] if a lot of people
[683.52 → 684.40] would agree with me
[684.40 → 686.36] oh I've got people asking
[686.36 → 687.24] where I am
[687.24 → 688.58] guys I'm at Google headquarters
[688.58 → 689.18] right now
[689.18 → 690.74] I came down for a
[690.74 → 691.82] YouTube creator day
[691.82 → 694.60] and I was actually a panellist
[694.60 → 696.18] which was really exciting for me
[696.18 → 697.02] because it was only
[697.02 → 698.24] two and a half years ago
[698.24 → 699.86] that I was attending
[699.86 → 701.64] a similar event in Vancouver
[701.64 → 705.02] as just someone in the crowd
[705.02 → 707.28] and watching the other panellists
[707.28 → 708.66] talking
[708.66 → 709.24] so it was
[709.24 → 710.34] it was actually
[710.34 → 711.24] like super
[711.24 → 712.62] like I had goosebumps and stuff
[712.62 → 713.64] really exciting for me
[713.64 → 714.88] to be a part of that
[714.88 → 716.80] it's hilarious
[716.80 → 717.86] during the panel
[717.86 → 720.40] I'll get back to Final Fantasy 7
[720.40 → 721.22] I'm not done with that
[721.22 → 723.12] but during the panel
[723.12 → 724.94] Vessel actually came up
[724.94 → 726.72] and yeah
[726.72 → 729.40] I kind of had to look over
[729.40 → 730.52] at the YouTube guys
[730.52 → 731.08] I was like
[731.08 → 732.18] so
[732.18 → 734.08] well
[734.08 → 734.58] gee
[734.58 → 736.10] it's funny you ask about that
[736.10 → 737.22] actually it's been great
[737.22 → 738.36] it hasn't impacted
[738.36 → 739.30] our YouTube views
[739.30 → 739.90] it's been
[739.90 → 741.42] purely incremental
[741.42 → 742.68] audience building
[742.68 → 743.68] and engagement
[743.68 → 744.52] and interaction
[744.52 → 746.90] yeah
[746.90 → 748.26] I'm
[748.26 → 749.94] I'm liking it
[749.94 → 753.14] and you know what
[753.14 → 754.02] the YouTube guys
[754.02 → 754.64] are really
[754.64 → 755.74] cool about it
[755.74 → 756.50] and respectful
[756.50 → 757.30] of sort of
[757.30 → 757.60] you know
[757.60 → 758.88] what YouTubers
[758.88 → 759.54] are doing
[759.54 → 760.78] to build their business
[760.78 → 761.78] and they've really
[761.78 → 762.50] started taking
[762.50 → 763.56] my feedback
[763.56 → 764.36] directly
[764.36 → 766.10] about how we can
[766.10 → 766.66] work together
[766.66 → 767.60] for me to not need
[767.60 → 768.50] other video platforms
[768.50 → 769.02] as much
[769.02 → 769.24] so
[769.24 → 771.08] yeah
[771.08 → 772.10] no it's
[772.10 → 773.48] super
[773.48 → 774.32] super cool
[774.32 → 775.62] oh
[775.62 → 776.10] oh
[776.10 → 776.52] oh
[776.52 → 776.86] oh
[776.86 → 777.46] okay
[777.46 → 778.18] okay
[778.18 → 778.64] no
[778.64 → 779.32] never mind
[779.32 → 780.50] Nick is
[780.50 → 781.64] wrecking me
[781.64 → 782.26] right now
[782.26 → 782.84] he's like
[782.84 → 783.68] well actually
[783.68 → 785.02] Final Fantasy 7
[785.02 → 787.02] is in the dock
[787.02 → 787.92] it's in Rapid Fire
[787.92 → 788.66] it was broken out
[788.66 → 789.40] into its own topic
[789.40 → 790.70] because it is more
[790.70 → 792.18] than just
[792.18 → 793.82] a visual update
[793.82 → 794.48] which is something
[794.48 → 795.70] that they have done
[795.70 → 796.38] before
[796.38 → 798.16] so it is an actual
[798.16 → 799.56] remake
[799.56 → 800.90] as opposed to
[800.90 → 801.54] just replacing
[801.54 → 802.78] graphical assets
[802.78 → 804.00] so
[804.00 → 805.86] um
[805.86 → 807.14] that always worries me
[807.14 → 807.70] actually
[807.70 → 808.92] yeah
[808.92 → 809.88] are they going to
[809.88 → 810.60] change how the game
[810.60 → 811.04] works
[811.04 → 811.50] yeah
[811.50 → 812.90] gameplay will be
[812.90 → 814.00] receiving an update
[814.00 → 815.22] not just
[815.22 → 815.96] the visuals
[815.96 → 817.12] um
[817.12 → 817.74] so they're also
[817.74 → 818.30] bringing the
[818.30 → 818.64] original
[818.64 → 819.34] bringing the
[819.34 → 820.72] an HD port version
[820.72 → 821.90] of the original game
[821.90 → 823.16] to the PlayStation 4
[823.16 → 824.42] anyway
[824.42 → 825.64] back to Final Fantasy
[825.64 → 826.56] 7 not being the
[826.56 → 827.32] the best Final Fantasy
[827.32 → 828.26] I know I've covered
[828.26 → 828.92] this on the show
[828.92 → 829.34] before
[829.34 → 830.80] but I will cover
[830.80 → 831.82] it as many times
[831.82 → 832.42] as it takes
[832.42 → 833.28] until everyone
[833.28 → 834.02] goes and plays
[834.02 → 834.98] Final Fantasy 6
[834.98 → 835.72] for its superior
[835.72 → 836.56] storytelling and
[836.56 → 836.94] characters
[836.94 → 838.28] because nothing
[838.28 → 839.46] happens in
[839.46 → 840.42] Final Fantasy 7
[840.42 → 841.40] you could
[841.40 → 842.18] you know that
[842.18 → 842.72] stupid
[842.72 → 843.38] have you guys
[843.38 → 843.86] ever seen
[843.86 → 844.60] the Guitar Hero
[844.60 → 845.90] episode of
[845.90 → 846.60] South Park
[846.60 → 848.00] have you seen it
[848.00 → 848.20] Luke
[848.20 → 848.44] no
[848.44 → 849.36] okay well
[849.36 → 849.88] basically
[849.88 → 851.38] Stan becomes
[851.38 → 852.24] a Guitar Hero
[852.24 → 853.68] Rockstar by playing
[853.68 → 854.62] the game really well
[854.62 → 855.60] and he know
[855.60 → 857.04] the stress of the fame
[857.04 → 858.50] of being a Guitar Hero
[858.50 → 860.02] leads him to try
[860.02 → 860.88] another game called
[860.88 → 861.54] Heroin Hero
[861.54 → 862.86] where he just runs
[862.86 → 863.92] around after a dragon
[863.92 → 864.52] in the forest
[864.52 → 865.54] shooting up heroine
[865.54 → 868.60] to me that's Final Fantasy 7
[868.60 → 870.38] you just run around
[870.38 → 871.64] and you chase the dragon
[871.64 → 872.76] the whole time
[872.76 → 873.82] and then finally you find
[873.82 → 874.24] the dragon
[874.24 → 875.10] it turns out he's not
[875.10 → 875.50] a dragon
[875.50 → 876.52] he's like an
[876.52 → 877.42] otherworldly being
[877.42 → 878.16] or some crap
[878.16 → 879.44] and it's not like
[879.44 → 880.14] that's the first time
[880.14 → 880.70] they've done that
[880.70 → 881.14] in fact
[881.14 → 881.92] spoiler alert
[881.92 → 883.34] because Final Fantasy 6
[883.34 → 884.04] is a game that's worth
[884.04 → 885.02] playing unlike the
[885.02 → 885.44] other one
[885.44 → 886.74] spoiler alert
[886.74 → 887.58] that happens with
[887.58 → 889.26] one of the antagonists
[889.26 → 890.46] in Final Fantasy 6 2
[890.46 → 891.32] and it's kind of a
[891.32 → 891.94] common theme for
[891.94 → 892.50] Final Fantasy
[892.50 → 894.56] but it just is
[894.56 → 895.56] yeah dumb
[895.56 → 897.86] that's kind of funny
[897.86 → 898.96] the only Final Fantasy
[898.96 → 900.12] people are going to
[900.12 → 900.60] stab me
[900.60 → 901.42] after I say this
[901.42 → 902.60] but the only Final Fantasy
[902.60 → 904.82] I've ever played
[904.82 → 905.80] is I think
[905.80 → 908.02] 8 and like
[908.02 → 909.90] 13
[909.90 → 910.86] or something
[910.86 → 911.58] and I played like
[911.58 → 912.66] half an hour of 13
[912.66 → 913.16] was like
[913.16 → 914.26] I don't like this
[914.26 → 916.02] and I loved 8
[916.02 → 916.94] and then everyone
[916.94 → 917.60] hates 8
[917.60 → 918.70] so it's like
[918.70 → 919.46] okay whatever
[919.46 → 920.08] I should probably
[920.08 → 920.76] go back and play
[920.76 → 921.54] 6 at 7
[921.54 → 922.42] so I can join
[922.42 → 923.12] this conversation
[923.12 → 924.32] yeah I
[924.32 → 925.40] I didn't
[925.40 → 926.56] I didn't like
[926.56 → 927.14] 8 much
[927.14 → 927.92] I'm trying to remember
[927.92 → 929.02] which one 13
[929.02 → 929.76] is
[929.76 → 930.56] I don't know
[930.56 → 931.64] if I played that one
[931.64 → 932.46] which one's the one
[932.46 → 933.34] with Titus
[933.34 → 937.42] I can't
[937.42 → 938.14] I can't remember
[938.14 → 939.62] I'm showing my
[939.62 → 940.44] old school ness
[940.44 → 940.84] right now
[940.84 → 941.82] yeah it's not 13
[941.82 → 942.60] maybe that's 10
[942.60 → 943.24] I think that's 10
[943.24 → 943.88] I played 10
[943.88 → 944.82] really enjoyed 10
[944.82 → 946.64] anyway
[946.64 → 947.34] people in chat
[947.34 → 948.14] are saying that 8
[948.14 → 948.90] was good
[948.90 → 949.60] so that's cool
[949.60 → 950.40] yeah
[950.40 → 951.34] some people really
[951.34 → 951.88] enjoyed 8
[951.88 → 952.42] I didn't
[952.42 → 953.06] I didn't like
[953.06 → 953.94] the combat system
[953.94 → 954.70] but you know what
[954.70 → 955.32] I only gave it
[955.32 → 956.14] about 20 minutes
[956.14 → 956.90] so I was
[956.90 → 957.70] probably
[957.70 → 960.04] I was pretty unfair
[960.04 → 960.36] to 8
[960.36 → 961.26] I borrowed 8
[961.26 → 961.92] from a friend
[961.92 → 963.02] so
[963.02 → 964.38] it was one of those
[964.38 → 965.06] things where I was
[965.06 → 965.72] either going to
[965.72 → 966.34] binge play
[966.34 → 967.54] the whole thing
[967.54 → 968.86] or
[968.86 → 969.88] I was going to
[969.88 → 970.42] have to like
[970.42 → 971.04] give it back
[971.04 → 971.58] in the middle
[971.58 → 972.46] for him to
[972.46 → 973.28] finish it or something
[973.28 → 974.02] like I only had it
[974.02 → 974.54] for a bit
[974.54 → 975.14] so I was like
[975.14 → 975.90] eh
[975.90 → 976.66] do I like this
[976.66 → 977.10] eh
[977.10 → 977.64] not that much
[977.64 → 978.26] not enough
[978.26 → 978.96] yeah yeah
[978.96 → 979.14] yeah
[979.14 → 980.08] because you needed
[980.08 → 980.60] the discs
[980.60 → 981.38] for that game
[981.38 → 982.24] there was like
[982.24 → 982.90] 6 of them
[982.90 → 983.24] or something
[983.24 → 983.58] it was like
[983.58 → 984.40] oh new chapters
[984.40 → 985.30] swap the disc out
[985.30 → 986.24] oh old school

[988.14 → 988.24] I was
[988.24 → 990.30] I sat down
[990.30 → 990.84] to play a game
[990.84 → 991.32] the other day
[991.32 → 992.18] and my girlfriend

[1043.78 → 1044.76] always collectively
[1044.76 → 1045.92] knows and doesn't
[1045.92 → 1046.62] know everything
[1046.62 → 1048.64] so let's move on
[1048.64 → 1049.34] to our next topic
[1049.34 → 1050.04] that last one
[1050.04 → 1050.64] was posted by
[1050.64 → 1052.00] mech777
[1052.00 → 1052.74] and I actually
[1052.74 → 1054.06] I never did this
[1054.06 → 1055.00] I meant to do this
[1055.00 → 1055.78] I'm copying the link
[1055.78 → 1056.62] URL right now
[1056.62 → 1058.14] so that's PC gamers
[1058.14 → 1059.06] round up of a lot
[1059.06 → 1059.70] of the stuff that
[1059.70 → 1060.30] we were saying
[1060.30 → 1061.52] we were not excited
[1061.52 → 1062.44] about depending on
[1062.44 → 1063.00] whether it was me
[1063.00 → 1063.68] or Luke talking
[1063.68 → 1067.68] and for our next
[1067.68 → 1068.50] one for our next
[1068.50 → 1069.46] trick we've got
[1069.46 → 1070.42] South Korea
[1070.42 → 1071.90] and this original
[1071.90 → 1072.98] article here is from
[1072.98 → 1074.28] koreaherald.com
[1074.28 → 1075.30] announcing
[1075.30 → 1076.98] GIG ALTE
[1076.98 → 1077.74] the world's
[1077.74 → 1078.62] fastest
[1078.62 → 1079.82] LTE
[1079.82 → 1080.90] connection
[1080.90 → 1082.20] and what's
[1082.20 → 1082.86] really cool
[1082.86 → 1083.36] about this
[1083.36 → 1083.80] is a couple
[1083.80 → 1084.14] of things
[1084.14 → 1084.46] so number
[1084.46 → 1084.82] one
[1084.82 → 1085.80] it combines
[1085.80 → 1086.26] LTE
[1086.26 → 1087.08] with Wi-Fi
[1087.08 → 1087.60] connections
[1087.60 → 1088.72] it offers
[1088.72 → 1089.42] a maximum
[1089.42 → 1090.16] download speed
[1090.16 → 1091.56] of 1.17
[1091.56 → 1092.16] gigabit
[1092.16 → 1092.74] per second
[1092.74 → 1093.76] 15 times
[1093.76 → 1094.44] faster than
[1094.44 → 1095.26] existing LTE
[1095.26 → 1096.14] and 4 times
[1096.14 → 1097.14] faster than
[1097.14 → 1097.64] Tri-band
[1097.64 → 1098.48] LTE Advanced
[1098.48 → 1099.28] like this is
[1099.28 → 1100.04] some bananas
[1100.04 → 1101.22] crap here
[1101.22 → 1101.90] so cool
[1101.90 → 1103.28] 10 times
[1103.28 → 1103.96] faster upload
[1103.96 → 1104.70] speed than
[1104.70 → 1105.76] Tri-band
[1105.76 → 1106.30] broadcast
[1106.30 → 1107.26] LTE Advanced
[1107.26 → 1109.06] but the
[1109.06 → 1109.40] really
[1109.40 → 1110.46] really cool
[1110.46 → 1110.98] thing about
[1110.98 → 1111.64] this to me
[1111.64 → 1112.54] is the fact
[1112.54 → 1113.04] that the
[1113.04 → 1116.22] Galaxy S6
[1116.22 → 1117.00] and S6
[1117.00 → 1117.34] Edge
[1117.34 → 1118.24] are already
[1118.24 → 1118.80] compatible
[1118.80 → 1119.86] with Samsung
[1119.86 → 1120.60] launching
[1120.60 → 1121.34] I think they
[1121.34 → 1122.48] said 5 to 6
[1122.48 → 1123.44] more mid
[1123.44 → 1124.06] to high end
[1124.06 → 1124.50] phones
[1124.50 → 1125.08] before the
[1125.08 → 1125.88] end of the
[1125.88 → 1126.32] year
[1126.32 → 1127.88] along with
[1127.88 → 1128.44] some LG
[1128.44 → 1129.06] electronics
[1129.06 → 1129.52] handsets
[1129.52 → 1129.94] that will be
[1129.94 → 1130.42] compatible
[1130.42 → 1130.84] with this
[1130.84 → 1131.30] technology
[1131.30 → 1132.02] people on
[1132.02 → 1132.46] the planet
[1132.46 → 1132.94] before the
[1132.94 → 1133.30] end of the
[1133.30 → 1133.54] year
[1133.54 → 1134.18] will be
[1134.18 → 1134.52] using
[1134.52 → 1135.18] gigabit
[1135.18 → 1135.64] connections
[1135.64 → 1136.06] on their
[1136.06 → 1136.42] phones
[1136.42 → 1137.46] that's
[1137.46 → 1138.02] ridiculous
[1138.02 → 1138.70] what the
[1138.70 → 1139.00] hell
[1139.00 → 1139.44] Canada
[1139.44 → 1140.72] yeah
[1140.72 → 1141.16] we're
[1141.16 → 1141.48] doing a
[1141.48 → 1141.84] little rough
[1141.84 → 1142.16] did I
[1142.16 → 1143.36] ever show
[1143.36 → 1143.72] you my
[1143.72 → 1144.34] data usage
[1144.34 → 1145.10] from the
[1145.10 → 1145.70] Computer
[1145.70 → 1145.94] trip
[1145.94 → 1147.34] no
[1147.34 → 1148.72] it was
[1148.72 → 1149.24] an unlimited
[1149.24 → 1149.98] H plus
[1149.98 → 1150.30] sim
[1150.30 → 1152.02] so by the
[1152.02 → 1152.32] end of the
[1152.32 → 1152.66] trip I
[1152.66 → 1152.96] think I was
[1152.96 → 1153.22] at like
[1153.22 → 1153.92] 16
[1153.92 → 1154.72] gigabytes
[1154.72 → 1155.92] used
[1155.92 → 1156.80] sick
[1156.80 → 1157.16] and how
[1157.16 → 1157.50] much did
[1157.50 → 1157.74] you pay
[1157.74 → 1158.16] for that
[1158.16 → 1159.24] 25 bucks
[1159.24 → 1159.70] yeah
[1159.70 → 1160.72] oh man
[1160.72 → 1161.38] just ridiculous
[1161.38 → 1162.00] and like
[1162.00 → 1162.30] we
[1162.30 → 1162.92] Brandon and I
[1162.92 → 1163.22] kind of
[1163.22 → 1163.72] realized
[1163.72 → 1164.04] partway
[1164.04 → 1164.24] through
[1164.24 → 1164.72] because when
[1164.72 → 1165.16] you're in
[1165.16 → 1166.04] the states
[1166.04 → 1166.38] and you have
[1166.38 → 1166.94] your Verizon
[1166.94 → 1167.64] sim, and it's
[1167.64 → 1168.30] unlimited data
[1168.30 → 1169.58] but only the
[1169.58 → 1170.36] first whatever
[1170.36 → 1171.10] is actually
[1171.10 → 1171.50] LTE
[1171.50 → 1172.60] yeah and we
[1172.60 → 1172.80] have an
[1172.80 → 1173.40] interesting news
[1173.40 → 1173.94] topic about
[1173.94 → 1174.44] that later
[1174.44 → 1174.90] you guys
[1174.90 → 1175.58] by the way
[1175.58 → 1176.70] throttling
[1176.70 → 1177.62] unlimited
[1177.62 → 1178.58] go ahead
[1178.58 → 1178.92] go ahead
[1178.92 → 1182.18] but on that
[1182.18 → 1182.78] one you can't
[1182.78 → 1183.10] tether
[1183.10 → 1184.54] so partway
[1184.54 → 1184.86] through I was
[1184.86 → 1185.50] like I wonder
[1185.50 → 1186.18] if it'll work
[1186.18 → 1186.56] and I just
[1186.56 → 1187.08] tethered to my
[1187.08 → 1187.70] laptop and it
[1187.70 → 1188.12] works I was
[1188.12 → 1188.96] like oh yes
[1188.96 → 1189.50] and then that
[1189.50 → 1190.24] day the data
[1190.24 → 1190.90] spike is just
[1190.90 → 1191.70] massive
[1191.70 → 1193.16] nice
[1193.16 → 1194.44] this is so
[1194.44 → 1194.72] great
[1194.72 → 1195.58] someone sent
[1195.58 → 1196.12] me a picture
[1196.12 → 1197.20] of his usage
[1197.20 → 1198.22] of like 500
[1198.22 → 1198.76] and something
[1198.76 → 1199.60] gigabytes in
[1199.60 → 1200.18] one month
[1200.18 → 1201.04] on his data
[1201.04 → 1201.48] connection
[1201.48 → 1202.32] wow
[1202.32 → 1202.60] because he has
[1202.60 → 1203.08] unlimited plan
[1203.08 → 1203.68] I'm assuming
[1203.68 → 1204.16] he connects
[1204.16 → 1204.58] it to his
[1204.58 → 1205.18] computer and
[1205.18 → 1205.58] like does
[1205.58 → 1206.20] all the things
[1206.20 → 1206.78] but still
[1206.78 → 1207.60] ridiculous
[1207.60 → 1208.44] yeah that's
[1208.44 → 1209.26] awesome I
[1209.26 → 1209.84] mean to be
[1209.84 → 1210.60] able to do
[1210.60 → 1211.36] that is
[1211.36 → 1212.68] something that
[1212.68 → 1213.18] we can only
[1213.18 → 1213.94] dream of here
[1213.94 → 1214.68] here's an
[1214.68 → 1215.20] interesting thing
[1215.20 → 1215.62] I just sent
[1215.62 → 1216.06] you a link
[1216.06 → 1217.56] in our
[1217.56 → 1218.48] chat here
[1218.48 → 1218.82] if you want
[1218.82 → 1219.22] to go ahead
[1219.22 → 1219.60] and fire
[1219.60 → 1220.08] that up
[1220.08 → 1221.42] zoom in
[1221.42 → 1221.76] on the
[1221.76 → 1222.32] lower mainland
[1222.32 → 1223.74] I can't
[1223.74 → 1224.04] can you
[1224.04 → 1224.36] send it
[1224.36 → 1224.94] in hangouts
[1224.94 → 1226.56] oh yes
[1226.56 → 1226.96] I can
[1226.96 → 1227.38] in fact I
[1227.38 → 1227.80] already did
[1227.80 → 1228.20] you didn't
[1228.20 → 1228.58] see it in
[1228.58 → 1228.86] hangouts
[1228.86 → 1229.26] so that was
[1229.26 → 1229.56] why I
[1229.56 → 1230.10] tried elsewhere
[1230.10 → 1233.30] bring that
[1233.30 → 1234.04] up because
[1234.04 → 1235.16] here's what
[1235.16 → 1235.62] I want to
[1235.62 → 1236.16] know
[1236.16 → 1237.68] it's a map
[1237.68 → 1238.92] of cellular
[1238.92 → 1240.16] tower locations
[1240.16 → 1241.34] in Canada
[1241.34 → 1242.80] and you can
[1242.80 → 1243.50] actually sort
[1243.50 → 1244.22] it by the
[1244.22 → 1245.06] major the
[1245.06 → 1245.60] big three
[1245.60 → 1246.66] carriers up here
[1246.66 → 1247.50] and what I
[1247.50 → 1248.40] observed about
[1248.40 → 1248.80] the lower
[1248.80 → 1249.44] mainland in
[1249.44 → 1250.46] particular is
[1250.46 → 1251.26] that while
[1251.26 → 1252.70] Rogers and
[1252.70 → 1253.94] Telus have
[1253.94 → 1256.00] tons and
[1256.00 → 1257.20] tons of
[1257.20 → 1257.86] towers like
[1257.86 → 1258.82] it's its
[1258.82 → 1259.38] absolutely
[1259.38 → 1260.54] bananas how
[1260.54 → 1261.08] many towers
[1261.08 → 1262.12] they have
[1262.12 → 1263.60] Bell has
[1263.60 → 1264.76] very few and
[1264.76 → 1265.20] yet their
[1265.20 → 1266.04] reception here
[1266.04 → 1266.68] is really
[1266.68 → 1267.32] good like
[1267.32 → 1267.62] have you
[1267.62 → 1268.22] noticed that
[1268.22 → 1269.78] I haven't
[1269.78 → 1270.20] noticed it
[1270.20 → 1270.84] being worse
[1270.84 → 1271.54] than Telus
[1271.54 → 1272.52] so if they
[1272.52 → 1273.14] just have
[1273.14 → 1274.26] like a few
[1274.26 → 1275.20] awesome towers
[1275.20 → 1275.82] then why
[1275.82 → 1276.30] can't I
[1276.30 → 1277.06] have gigabit
[1277.06 → 1277.58] connections
[1277.58 → 1278.96] yeah really
[1278.96 → 1279.68] that's what I
[1279.68 → 1280.06] want to know
[1280.06 → 1280.64] come on Bell
[1280.64 → 1281.28] it's only like
[1281.28 → 1282.38] 15 towers
[1282.38 → 1283.22] make it happen
[1283.22 → 1284.22] like look at
[1284.22 → 1284.78] for people
[1284.78 → 1285.30] watching
[1285.30 → 1286.68] look at the
[1286.68 → 1287.30] difference between
[1287.30 → 1288.12] say Rogers
[1288.12 → 1291.04] or even
[1291.04 → 1291.54] Telus
[1291.54 → 1292.72] man
[1292.72 → 1293.18] Telus's
[1293.18 → 1293.58] coverage of
[1293.58 → 1293.94] Alberta
[1293.94 → 1294.36] is just
[1294.36 → 1295.24] nuts
[1295.24 → 1297.10] you can really
[1297.10 → 1297.68] tell where
[1297.68 → 1298.16] they're where
[1298.16 → 1298.76] they're focusing
[1298.76 → 1299.36] their business
[1299.36 → 1299.86] in on by
[1299.86 → 1300.32] looking at
[1300.32 → 1300.66] this kind
[1300.66 → 1301.06] of a map
[1301.06 → 1301.88] like Bell
[1301.88 → 1302.58] in the east
[1302.58 → 1304.66] is supremely
[1304.66 → 1305.18] bananas
[1305.18 → 1305.72] and then in
[1305.72 → 1306.36] Saskatchewan
[1306.36 → 1306.90] it's just a
[1306.90 → 1307.58] black hole
[1307.58 → 1310.40] and then
[1310.40 → 1310.80] Telus
[1310.80 → 1311.32] I mean that
[1311.32 → 1311.84] makes a ton
[1311.84 → 1312.18] of sense
[1312.18 → 1312.94] because they
[1312.94 → 1313.34] used to be
[1313.34 → 1314.04] BC Tel
[1314.04 → 1314.84] then they
[1314.84 → 1315.14] when they
[1315.14 → 1315.76] expanded to
[1315.76 → 1316.20] Alberta
[1316.20 → 1317.00] they became
[1317.00 → 1317.56] Telus
[1317.56 → 1318.38] so they're
[1318.38 → 1319.40] almost entirely
[1319.40 → 1320.32] western focused
[1320.32 → 1321.34] that makes sense
[1321.34 → 1322.38] and then Bell's
[1322.38 → 1323.10] like trying to
[1323.10 → 1324.06] capture the
[1324.06 → 1325.28] territories up
[1325.28 → 1325.60] north
[1325.60 → 1328.16] which is actually
[1328.16 → 1328.82] rather interesting
[1328.82 → 1329.54] because it
[1329.54 → 1330.02] doesn't look like
[1330.02 → 1331.12] Rogers or Telus
[1331.12 → 1331.64] are up there
[1331.64 → 1333.62] very cool stuff
[1333.62 → 1333.94] though hey
[1333.94 → 1334.52] I had actually
[1334.52 → 1335.02] just stumbled
[1335.02 → 1335.58] across this
[1335.58 → 1335.92] because I was
[1335.92 → 1336.36] trying to figure
[1336.36 → 1337.12] out why
[1337.12 → 1338.76] and this is
[1338.76 → 1339.44] kind of related
[1339.44 → 1340.48] why our Bell
[1340.48 → 1341.22] reception at the
[1341.22 → 1341.84] new office is
[1341.84 → 1342.74] not very good
[1342.74 → 1344.08] and it turns out
[1344.08 → 1344.62] there's a tower
[1344.62 → 1346.40] like right nearby
[1346.40 → 1347.56] so I'm not sure
[1347.56 → 1348.22] what the deal is
[1348.22 → 1348.88] it could just be
[1348.88 → 1349.64] the concrete
[1349.64 → 1350.24] building and the
[1350.24 → 1350.76] metal roof
[1350.76 → 1351.64] and that's just
[1351.64 → 1352.02] life
[1352.02 → 1352.60] I think it's the
[1352.60 → 1353.08] building because
[1353.08 → 1354.02] there's pretty okay
[1354.02 → 1354.98] reception just outside
[1354.98 → 1355.68] the door and then
[1355.68 → 1356.36] you walk in and
[1356.36 → 1356.74] you're screwed
[1356.74 → 1357.72] it's okay though
[1357.72 → 1358.58] we have a plan
[1358.58 → 1359.48] it's not cheap
[1359.48 → 1360.58] like everything about
[1360.58 → 1361.44] this freaking new
[1361.44 → 1362.72] office, but we are
[1362.72 → 1363.62] getting a booster
[1363.62 → 1365.46] that will make it
[1365.46 → 1366.34] so we've got an
[1366.34 → 1367.24] antenna outside
[1367.24 → 1367.98] on the roof
[1367.98 → 1368.48] and then we'll
[1368.48 → 1369.52] have a booster
[1369.52 → 1370.16] for the inside
[1370.16 → 1370.78] we'll actually have
[1370.78 → 1371.54] three antennas
[1371.54 → 1371.94] internally
[1371.94 → 1373.14] there you go
[1373.14 → 1374.40] so that's the plan
[1374.40 → 1374.84] anyway
[1374.84 → 1376.26] good on South Korea
[1376.26 → 1377.66] for caring about
[1377.66 → 1378.84] superfast mobile
[1378.84 → 1379.76] internet and stuff
[1379.76 → 1381.80] moving on to our
[1381.80 → 1382.50] next topic here
[1382.50 → 1383.02] this was posted
[1383.02 → 1384.06] by Mage Tank
[1384.06 → 1385.34] I'm going to go ahead
[1385.34 → 1385.94] and copy
[1385.94 → 1386.52] Mage Tank
[1386.52 → 1387.56] Mage Tank
[1387.56 → 1387.96] that sounds
[1387.96 → 1388.32] awesome
[1388.32 → 1388.86] the most overpowered
[1388.86 → 1389.48] class
[1389.48 → 1391.10] the Mage Tank
[1391.10 → 1394.34] I would love
[1394.34 → 1395.22] for like the
[1395.22 → 1396.06] Linus Tech Tips
[1396.06 → 1397.10] game to have a
[1397.10 → 1397.68] Mage Tank
[1397.68 → 1398.30] class
[1398.30 → 1398.98] it should
[1398.98 → 1399.94] and you just
[1399.94 → 1400.36] kind of
[1400.36 → 1401.14] you just kind of
[1401.14 → 1402.04] automatically win
[1402.04 → 1402.74] like only one
[1402.74 → 1403.56] person per team
[1403.56 → 1404.28] gets to be Mage
[1404.28 → 1405.04] Tank, so there will
[1405.04 → 1405.82] always be only like
[1405.82 → 1406.60] two on the board
[1406.60 → 1408.24] but that could
[1408.24 → 1409.04] actually be kind of
[1409.04 → 1409.86] cool having like a
[1409.86 → 1411.18] completely OP but
[1411.18 → 1412.10] limited in terms of
[1412.10 → 1412.78] how many people can
[1412.78 → 1413.52] play at class
[1413.52 → 1414.78] so you have to like
[1414.78 → 1415.88] like the rest of
[1415.88 → 1416.56] your team kind of
[1416.56 → 1417.56] has to protect the
[1417.56 → 1418.44] Mage Tank even
[1418.44 → 1419.16] though it's a tank
[1419.16 → 1420.18] yeah
[1420.18 → 1420.98] because you want
[1420.98 → 1421.68] to survive because
[1421.68 → 1422.54] it's also a mage
[1422.54 → 1423.82] that'd be kind of
[1423.82 → 1424.76] cool yeah and like
[1424.76 → 1425.58] the Mage Tank should
[1425.58 → 1426.76] basically be able to
[1426.76 → 1427.88] kind of roll anyone
[1427.88 → 1428.60] other than the other
[1428.60 → 1429.30] Mage Tank I'm sure
[1429.30 → 1429.98] someone's done this
[1429.98 → 1431.58] anyway the Bradwell
[1431.58 → 1434.86] Core i7 5775C has
[1434.86 → 1436.00] gaming performance on
[1436.00 → 1436.98] par with Haswell
[1436.98 → 1438.34] and the original
[1438.34 → 1439.28] article here is from
[1439.28 → 1440.64] Maximum PC they've
[1440.64 → 1441.88] got a bunch of
[1441.88 → 1443.20] perfect information
[1443.20 → 1444.50] about it more
[1444.50 → 1445.60] importantly than
[1445.60 → 1446.88] almost anything else
[1446.88 → 1448.10] is the information
[1448.10 → 1449.90] that Bradwell
[1449.90 → 1451.86] desktop was super
[1451.86 → 1454.82] duper late it's
[1454.82 → 1456.86] late it's an it's
[1456.86 → 1459.08] it's a refresh at a
[1459.08 → 1460.36] smaller process node
[1460.36 → 1461.24] of an existing
[1461.24 → 1462.82] Haswell architecture
[1462.82 → 1464.90] you know processor
[1464.90 → 1466.60] series so performance
[1466.60 → 1468.98] improvements are you
[1468.98 → 1470.08] know we got
[1470.08 → 1471.36] something small but
[1471.36 → 1472.10] the frequencies are
[1472.10 → 1473.42] actually lower out of
[1473.42 → 1474.26] the box so the
[1474.26 → 1475.62] performance is pretty
[1475.62 → 1476.60] darn near the same
[1476.60 → 1477.94] except it's got way
[1477.94 → 1478.64] better on board
[1478.64 → 1479.86] graphics so if you're
[1479.86 → 1480.64] into that sort of
[1480.64 → 1481.64] thing then on board
[1481.64 → 1482.76] graphics performance is
[1482.76 → 1483.72] great it's got a lower
[1483.72 → 1484.86] TDP if you're into that
[1484.86 → 1486.38] sort of thing which I
[1486.38 → 1487.28] guess is cool it goes
[1487.28 → 1488.76] from 84 watts to 65
[1488.76 → 1491.06] watts the good news is
[1491.06 → 1492.64] that C which is for
[1492.64 → 1495.50] Crystal Well the Intel
[1495.50 → 1496.96] Iris Pro graphics
[1496.96 → 1500.18] code name the C does not
[1500.18 → 1502.02] mean it's not unlocked so
[1502.02 → 1503.94] C class processors are
[1503.94 → 1505.28] still unlocked just like
[1505.28 → 1508.00] K's I have no idea why
[1508.00 → 1509.32] after all the marketing
[1509.32 → 1511.16] Intel has done about K
[1511.16 → 1512.52] why they're changing
[1512.52 → 1514.52] that that's really silly
[1514.52 → 1516.00] maybe someone a lot
[1516.00 → 1517.94] smarter than me could
[1517.94 → 1519.86] figure that out and tell
[1519.86 → 1520.86] me what C means maybe
[1520.86 → 1521.90] they're like well
[1521.90 → 1523.66] sometimes they sound the
[1523.66 → 1525.74] same so it's cool right
[1525.74 → 1527.32] maybe it's C for clock
[1527.32 → 1528.88] speed increasing
[1528.88 → 1530.24] enhanced and speed
[1530.24 → 1531.22] awesomeness one thing
[1531.22 → 1532.84] that's pretty cool is as
[1532.84 → 1534.00] you can see on this chart
[1534.00 → 1534.56] that's on the screen
[1534.56 → 1536.14] right now it shows ED
[1536.14 → 1539.60] DRAM there we go
[1539.60 → 1541.62] yeah talk and L4 cache
[1541.62 → 1543.34] so if you're not using if
[1543.34 → 1544.02] you're using a discrete
[1544.02 → 1546.08] GPU that that DRAM for
[1546.08 → 1546.94] your graphics on your
[1546.94 → 1548.02] processor can be used as
[1548.02 → 1551.74] L4 cache yes so that is
[1551.74 → 1553.54] a really cool architectural
[1553.54 → 1555.14] enhancement which yes um
[1555.14 → 1557.02] doesn't necessarily show
[1557.02 → 1558.82] up in like you know
[1558.82 → 1560.36] broad well crushing
[1560.36 → 1561.82] has well performance
[1561.82 → 1564.24] right now but if
[1564.24 → 1567.06] developers kind of figured
[1567.06 → 1568.74] out, and you know all
[1568.74 → 1569.82] these things always
[1569.82 → 1571.32] take time developers
[1571.32 → 1572.76] developers yeah if
[1572.76 → 1574.78] developers get on board
[1574.78 → 1575.88] with this and kind of go
[1575.88 → 1577.84] oh hold on a second all
[1577.84 → 1579.14] of a sudden there's some
[1579.14 → 1581.06] this like weird even
[1581.06 → 1582.90] faster than system memory
[1582.90 → 1584.18] but not quite as fast as
[1584.18 → 1585.64] cache there's this like
[1585.64 → 1587.20] this weird in between if
[1587.20 → 1588.06] I can start leveraging
[1588.06 → 1590.14] that super cool lots of
[1590.14 → 1591.66] potential for it to for
[1591.66 → 1592.50] that to make a big
[1592.50 → 1593.26] difference in terms of
[1593.26 → 1595.24] performance um I mean
[1595.24 → 1596.34] more cache is never a bad
[1596.34 → 1598.00] thing with that said I
[1598.00 → 1599.36] actually did a really
[1599.36 → 1601.58] interesting article way
[1601.58 → 1603.30] back in the day for
[1603.30 → 1604.98] hardware connects because
[1604.98 → 1606.54] there was one period of
[1606.54 → 1610.40] time um where Intel
[1610.40 → 1612.44] actually had I think it was
[1612.44 → 1614.96] either three or four
[1614.96 → 1616.28] processors that were
[1616.28 → 1618.56] exactly the same spec for
[1618.56 → 1620.34] spec except for the cash
[1620.34 → 1621.24] level so they had a
[1621.24 → 1623.96] core 2 duos they had an uh
[1623.96 → 1626.18] like an e4000 series they
[1626.18 → 1629.76] had an e8000 series and
[1629.76 → 1630.74] then they had something
[1630.74 → 1632.92] else and for gaming at
[1632.92 → 1635.28] that time it made no
[1635.28 → 1637.52] difference at all going all
[1637.52 → 1638.84] the way from like a
[1638.84 → 1640.14] quarter as much cash to
[1640.14 → 1641.96] eight times as much cash I
[1641.96 → 1642.88] wish I could find the
[1642.88 → 1643.70] article because it was
[1643.70 → 1647.86] really cool um but there
[1647.86 → 1648.62] you there you go if
[1648.62 → 1650.12] someone if someone finds it
[1650.12 → 1651.48] and posted in twitch chat it
[1651.48 → 1652.46] might not even be there
[1652.46 → 1652.86] anymore
[1652.86 → 1658.18] um hardware connects cash
[1658.18 → 1660.60] like there's going to be yeah I
[1660.60 → 1661.72] I don't think I'm I don't
[1661.72 → 1662.76] think I'm going to be able to
[1662.76 → 1664.04] find it that's that's a real
[1664.04 → 1667.84] shame but uh oh I really
[1667.84 → 1668.90] hope that I don't know if
[1668.90 → 1669.52] this is a publicly
[1669.52 → 1670.52] announced thing but you
[1670.52 → 1673.14] know what now it is um I
[1673.14 → 1675.10] really hope that we are
[1675.10 → 1676.30] able to wrangle a whole
[1676.30 → 1677.36] bunch of the same card
[1677.36 → 1678.22] because of what you just
[1678.22 → 1680.46] said uh you mentioned
[1680.46 → 1683.10] same spec and then
[1683.10 → 1684.58] wondering if the cash would
[1684.58 → 1686.62] be different yes oh go
[1686.62 → 1687.86] ahead go but what we
[1687.86 → 1689.34] want to do is check out
[1689.34 → 1691.06] because in a review that's
[1691.06 → 1692.50] coming out soon on a
[1692.50 → 1694.04] gigabyte 980 ti that we
[1694.04 → 1695.90] have a g1 gaming 980 ti
[1695.90 → 1697.74] um it's like oh rated
[1697.74 → 1699.70] speed uh boost clock
[1699.70 → 1700.68] blah I don't remember
[1700.68 → 1701.82] exactly what it is and
[1701.82 → 1702.86] then what we actually got
[1702.86 → 1703.78] without touching it at
[1703.78 → 1705.40] all was way higher I think
[1705.40 → 1706.68] like 70 megahertz higher
[1706.68 → 1707.72] or something and that's
[1707.72 → 1708.68] happening with cards all
[1708.68 → 1709.52] over the place and that's
[1709.52 → 1711.26] in a hot room too so like
[1711.26 → 1712.26] I don't know how it is
[1712.26 → 1713.22] testing the bloody thing
[1713.22 → 1716.58] yeah yeah um so what we
[1716.58 → 1717.64] want to do Linus actually
[1717.64 → 1718.58] proposed this, and I think
[1718.58 → 1719.92] it's brilliant is getting
[1719.92 → 1722.36] like a bunch of the
[1722.36 → 1724.24] same card all brand new
[1724.24 → 1724.90] and just take it out of
[1724.90 → 1725.72] the box put it on the
[1725.72 → 1727.02] bench figure out how fast
[1727.02 → 1728.60] it is okay next one and
[1728.60 → 1730.08] then just go and see
[1730.08 → 1731.28] figure out kind of like a
[1731.28 → 1732.76] general range the sample
[1732.76 → 1734.04] size won't be amazing with
[1734.04 → 1735.04] five or ten, but it'll still
[1735.04 → 1736.04] be fascinating to
[1736.04 → 1738.08] see yeah so we just want
[1738.08 → 1740.40] to see like if you guys
[1740.40 → 1741.64] are looking at like a
[1741.64 → 1743.60] graphics card review for a
[1743.60 → 1744.92] titan x or something and
[1745.60 → 1747.32] you kind of go oh it beats
[1747.32 → 1750.52] the know fury by you
[1750.52 → 1752.92] know three percent man it's
[1752.92 → 1754.44] better is that actually
[1754.44 → 1757.02] yeah what if the variance
[1757.02 → 1758.52] from sample to sample is
[1758.52 → 1760.44] like 10 percent we don't
[1760.44 → 1762.52] even know so we thought it
[1762.52 → 1763.14] would be a really
[1763.14 → 1764.62] interesting investigation and
[1764.62 → 1765.34] we want to we want to
[1765.34 → 1768.00] check it out yeah yes, yes
[1768.00 → 1770.24] yes, yes yes because yeah
[1770.24 → 1770.82] there's a lot of
[1770.82 → 1771.70] interesting things in that
[1771.70 → 1773.32] review to look at like um
[1773.32 → 1775.70] wattage from the wall
[1775.70 → 1776.80] difference between me
[1776.80 → 1777.88] overclocking it and GPU
[1777.88 → 1779.00] boost overclocking it was
[1779.00 → 1780.08] only like seven watts
[1780.08 → 1783.46] under load it's fairly
[1783.46 → 1785.24] interesting fairly
[1785.24 → 1787.90] interesting yes yeah so
[1787.90 → 1790.14] um right the big elephant
[1790.14 → 1791.16] in the room and the
[1791.16 → 1792.58] article that i
[1792.58 → 1793.38] linked actually did a
[1793.38 → 1794.90] perfect job of talking
[1794.90 → 1796.14] about this is that
[1796.14 → 1797.86] Bradwell was delayed by so
[1797.86 → 1800.16] much that sky lake is
[1800.16 → 1802.24] rumoured to be showing up in
[1802.24 → 1805.30] august so Bradwell's here
[1805.30 → 1808.22] but um sky lake is the
[1808.22 → 1809.92] actual architectural change
[1809.92 → 1810.52] where it's going to be on
[1810.52 → 1811.52] the same 14 nanometers
[1811.52 → 1813.54] process as Bradwell but
[1813.54 → 1815.46] with a new architecture not
[1815.46 → 1817.74] just like amped up on board
[1817.74 → 1819.56] graphics that you can use the
[1819.56 → 1823.02] embedded you know VRAM for a
[1823.02 → 1823.98] level four cache or something
[1823.98 → 1825.68] this is a is a new
[1826.46 → 1830.16] chip um so our advice whether
[1830.16 → 1833.58] even not knowing what sky lake
[1833.58 → 1836.44] has in store is kind of wait
[1836.44 → 1837.52] for sky lake right now it'll
[1837.52 → 1840.40] support ddr4 with that said um
[1840.40 → 1843.08] i believe sky lake also has
[1843.08 → 1846.60] support for ddr3 so uh yeah you
[1846.60 → 1847.70] know it's its just not looking
[1847.70 → 1848.88] like a good time to buy a new
[1848.88 → 1850.16] computer right now is it
[1850.16 → 1852.58] not really your vr4 prices are
[1852.58 → 1853.84] still too high and it's not like
[1853.84 → 1855.32] they're going to instantly drop
[1855.32 → 1857.62] overnight just because sky lake
[1857.62 → 1859.72] shows up so like fury stuff
[1859.72 → 1860.92] looks interesting enough and
[1860.92 → 1862.56] 9ati performs pretty damn well
[1862.56 → 1863.70] but then there's those like
[1863.70 → 1865.04] insane i don't remember the
[1865.04 → 1866.26] code name for them graphics
[1866.26 → 1867.50] cards just kind of on the
[1867.50 → 1871.26] horizon yep so let's all stay
[1871.26 → 1874.08] tuned basically welcome to any
[1874.08 → 1875.44] industry being on the leading
[1875.44 → 1878.14] edge of it yeah exactly so this
[1878.14 → 1880.30] is cool sort of uh king cry
[1880.30 → 1882.62] posted the original
[1882.62 → 1883.86] link here from the Washington
[1883.86 → 1885.56] post I'm going to drop that in
[1885.56 → 1887.80] the twitch chat for you guys um
[1887.80 → 1888.06] oh
[1888.06 → 1894.14] I'm trying I'm trying I'm
[1894.14 → 1895.20] gonna press the thing eventually
[1895.20 → 1897.64] AT&T was hit with a 100
[1897.64 → 1900.06] million dollar fine for
[1900.06 → 1902.30] throttling unlimited data
[1902.30 → 1904.44] customers the FCC assessed the
[1904.44 → 1907.20] fine on June 17th ATT has been
[1907.20 → 1908.88] accused of improperly slowing
[1908.88 → 1909.96] down internet speeds for
[1909.96 → 1911.28] customers who had signed up for
[1911.28 → 1914.22] unlimited data plans um it was
[1914.22 → 1915.56] assessed due to the lack of
[1915.56 → 1919.12] transparency in this action um a
[1919.12 → 1920.40] quote from the article here is
[1920.40 → 1922.16] AT&T should have been up front
[1922.16 → 1924.22] about throttled speed since they
[1924.22 → 1926.08] implemented the practice back in
[1926.08 → 1927.00] 2011
[1927.00 → 1931.40] in october 2014 the FCC sued AT&T
[1931.40 → 1933.14] due to an estimated three and a
[1933.14 → 1934.34] half million users having their
[1934.34 → 1935.80] internet service slow to dial up
[1935.80 → 1937.94] speeds on an average of 12 days a
[1937.94 → 1940.38] month so we're not talking like the
[1940.38 → 1941.96] last couple days of the month they
[1941.96 → 1944.18] like throttle you back you know to
[1944.18 → 1945.94] half speed or whatever we're
[1945.94 → 1949.28] talking screwing over the data
[1949.28 → 1950.68] access of their customers because
[1950.68 → 1952.38] they had the audacity to use the
[1952.38 → 1954.46] unlimited plan that they paid for
[1954.46 → 1957.68] it's like so what if i negotiate with
[1957.68 → 1961.02] Luke that uh you know I'm going to
[1961.02 → 1964.44] you know help him move something and
[1964.44 → 1968.00] in return he know has me help him
[1968.00 → 1969.76] move something and i like lift one
[1969.76 → 1972.52] thing and I'm like yeah i did it
[1972.52 → 1974.42] enough now so you can carry the rest
[1974.42 → 1976.92] by yourself like it's not Luke's
[1976.92 → 1978.18] fault that i offered to help him move
[1978.18 → 1979.56] something that's not how this works
[1979.56 → 1981.66] if ATD has a plan that you can buy and
[1981.66 → 1983.64] they have a price tag on it then you
[1983.64 → 1984.52] should be able to buy it
[1984.52 → 1988.16] yep that's pretty brutal and like the
[1988.16 → 1990.92] throttle speed is insane too it's not
[1990.92 → 1992.26] like they turned it down like a little
[1992.26 → 1994.52] bit like they put it to 512 kilobits
[1994.52 → 1996.20] per second like you can't do jack with
[1996.20 → 1996.50] that
[1996.50 → 1998.18] yeah exactly you could like
[1998.18 → 1999.60] ridiculous you could browse the
[1999.60 → 2001.22] Linus tech tips dot com for him
[2001.22 → 2004.62] yeah just kind of little slowly as
[2004.62 → 2006.10] long as yeah as long as people are
[2006.10 → 2007.62] polite and put their big images in
[2007.62 → 2009.74] spoiler hiders yeah it's just like
[2009.74 → 2011.42] don't go to the build blog section
[2011.42 → 2013.84] yeah don't go there don't go to the
[2013.84 → 2016.04] don't go to the memes thread yeah
[2016.04 → 2018.34] yeah don't really do anything
[2018.34 → 2020.92] anyway that's brutal like they yeah
[2020.92 → 2022.88] they didn't even i like how they show
[2022.88 → 2024.86] stops here so they're like 3.5
[2024.86 → 2027.46] 3.5 megabits per second speed required
[2027.46 → 2029.10] to stream a standard definition video
[2029.10 → 2031.00] 700 kilobits per second speed required
[2031.00 → 2033.16] to use FaceTime, and you're below that
[2033.16 → 2033.84] get wrecked
[2033.84 → 2037.74] i know it's not even be able to use
[2037.74 → 2040.00] FaceTime it's like yeah we're slowing
[2040.00 → 2042.22] down our data like strategically slow
[2042.22 → 2044.56] enough that you can just use a voice
[2044.56 → 2046.12] connection, and you can eat into your
[2046.12 → 2046.58] plan there
[2046.58 → 2048.08] yeah enjoy
[2048.08 → 2050.88] you like can't can't call your
[2050.88 → 2052.74] grandparents and like show them
[2052.74 → 2055.06] around your house seems to be the only
[2055.06 → 2056.54] thing that i know anyone uses FaceTime
[2056.54 → 2056.82] for
[2056.82 → 2059.92] if you guys follow me on social media
[2059.92 → 2062.60] um at all you've probably already
[2062.60 → 2065.14] seen this but I'm because I'm at Google
[2065.14 → 2068.20] headquarters and i actually i asked
[2068.20 → 2071.42] them for an um here hold on a second I'm
[2071.42 → 2072.98] going to get Luke to share this video I'm
[2072.98 → 2074.36] gonna I'm going to link you to it Luke so
[2074.36 → 2075.78] you don't have to look for it here but
[2075.78 → 2078.42] because I'm in google headquarters um and
[2078.42 → 2080.40] i told them i was streaming so they were
[2080.40 → 2082.68] like oh yeah okay so yeah we can get you
[2082.68 → 2085.22] a landline connection first thing i did
[2085.22 → 2089.52] of course is fired up that speed test and
[2089.52 → 2091.44] I'm I'm not gonna I'm not going to ruin the
[2091.44 → 2093.36] suspense I'm going to get Luke to uh to play
[2093.36 → 2095.36] the video over there and screen share with
[2095.36 → 2099.08] you guys but let me tell you i am uh i am
[2099.08 → 2103.06] pretty impressed i am loving it i
[2103.06 → 2108.26] really want uh we have to listen to you
[2108.26 → 2112.12] sorry i can't, it sounds muted i can't oh
[2112.12 → 2114.88] it's okay i all i say is hey guys I'm
[2114.88 → 2116.78] down at Google headquarters so the first
[2116.78 → 2119.88] thing i did was run a speed test so I've
[2119.88 → 2121.74] kind of covered that already gotcha
[2121.74 → 2128.34] holy balls one millisecond ping suckers
[2128.34 → 2131.48] that's so badass yeah man
[2131.48 → 2135.34] wow yeah sorry I'm not at Google HQ I'm
[2135.34 → 2138.72] at a Google campus excuse me we should
[2138.72 → 2140.64] just host a Google campus out of our new
[2140.64 → 2141.04] office
[2141.04 → 2142.60] yeah i know right
[2142.60 → 2147.04] it'd be so epic oh man like get wrecked
[2147.04 → 2147.54] everything
[2147.54 → 2150.24] that is real world speed with presumably
[2150.24 → 2151.68] like people in the building
[2151.68 → 2155.52] working like yeah and doing things and
[2155.52 → 2157.84] then the upload i actually i ran out of my
[2157.84 → 2160.18] 30 seconds worth of video recording before
[2160.18 → 2161.60] i could do the upload, but it was similar
[2161.60 → 2164.88] it was like 800 and 870 megabits per
[2164.88 → 2166.48] second there's something ridiculous like
[2166.48 → 2170.28] that it's so sad just the the the never
[2170.28 → 2173.74] wait for anything internet exactly and you
[2173.74 → 2176.80] can really feel it too like downloading
[2176.80 → 2179.10] files is just uh you know how browsers
[2179.10 → 2181.12] will do their virus scan yes you just
[2181.12 → 2183.38] click download, and then it's like scanning
[2183.38 → 2189.92] for viruses okay that's cool yeah thanks
[2189.92 → 2192.82] dog um although our internet at the new
[2192.82 → 2194.72] place should be pretty darn good too I'm
[2194.72 → 2197.16] excited about that did I tell you oh this
[2197.16 → 2198.78] is uh this is more of just like a Linus
[2198.78 → 2200.34] media group update i don't think Luke knows
[2200.34 → 2203.28] this yet so our installation date thanks to a
[2203.28 → 2206.84] miscommunication between our like fibre
[2206.84 → 2209.82] reseller and the backbone provider our
[2209.82 → 2212.72] install date has been pushed to after we'll
[2212.72 → 2216.68] be moving in oh so for the first little
[2216.68 → 2220.16] while we are actually going to be on a 4g
[2220.16 → 2225.30] hotspot wow provided by them or what
[2225.30 → 2227.74] uh yeah yeah provided by okay yeah so it's
[2227.74 → 2230.24] like that's going to get real expensive real
[2230.24 → 2232.92] fast provided by them for screwing it up
[2232.92 → 2237.04] but uh yeah so i was not impressed when i
[2237.04 → 2239.78] found out that uh the original and actually
[2239.78 → 2241.56] like i don't even know the speeds of the 4g
[2241.56 → 2244.20] hotspot are going to be but originally they
[2244.20 → 2245.90] were like yeah we can get you a six down
[2245.90 → 2249.16] one up ADSL line I'm like you have got to
[2249.16 → 2252.88] be kidding I'm buying 200 megabit symmetric
[2252.88 → 2254.82] fibre from you guys, and you think that i
[2254.82 → 2258.74] can get by with six down one up how is we're
[2258.74 → 2261.78] an online video company find a better
[2261.78 → 2263.64] solution well that hotspot's going to be
[2263.64 → 2265.60] ridiculous to you know that right i know
[2265.60 → 2268.92] it's going to be really dumb um, but it is
[2268.92 → 2271.50] what it is, and it'll be really nice when
[2271.50 → 2273.74] we when we upgrade I'm even thinking we
[2273.74 → 2276.06] could just do like wan show for a week
[2276.06 → 2277.86] from because it's not for long but we
[2277.86 → 2279.52] could do like a wan show one week from my
[2279.52 → 2280.82] house again for old time's sake or
[2280.82 → 2283.30] something like that yeah okay um there's
[2283.30 → 2286.04] a few more details about hold on I'm just
[2286.04 → 2287.36] going to copy the link this was posted by
[2287.36 → 2289.44] buzz on the forum about sky lake that we
[2289.44 → 2291.98] should probably share with you guys so um
[2291.98 → 2294.28] intel's good, so there's going to be the 6700k
[2294.28 → 2297.00] and 6600k and core i7 and core i5
[2297.00 → 2298.50] varieties so we're going back to the
[2298.50 → 2300.78] usual naming scheme, and we're getting a
[2300.78 → 2303.12] new socket so the thing about Bradwell
[2303.12 → 2304.94] is you can pop it in your existing d97
[2304.94 → 2307.68] board not in this not for sky lake you're
[2307.68 → 2310.30] going to need a z170 chipset and that's
[2310.30 → 2313.82] going to be on the LGA 1151 i believe it
[2313.82 → 2319.00] is yeah i think it's the LGA 1151 um
[2319.00 → 2322.20] chipset or socket so yet another subtle
[2322.20 → 2325.82] change intel really likes that 1150
[2325.82 → 2328.04] something number they're going to run
[2328.04 → 2331.76] out because we've had 1150 1155 1156 1151
[2331.76 → 2333.32] give it another sort of six years and
[2333.32 → 2334.18] they're going to have to do something
[2334.18 → 2335.92] different they can keep step yeah six
[2335.92 → 2337.14] years there you go i was going to say
[2337.14 → 2339.26] they can keep that weird stepping that
[2339.26 → 2342.10] they have going 157 152
[2342.10 → 2346.80] let me just find there's another um so
[2346.80 → 2348.60] hold on a couple more sky lake things
[2348.60 → 2350.48] before we move on to our last bit of
[2350.48 → 2352.80] intel news uh notebook versions of sky
[2352.80 → 2354.12] lake processors are planned for the
[2354.12 → 2356.46] fourth quarter of 2015 and intel's
[2356.46 → 2357.86] notebook reference design for the
[2357.86 → 2360.10] platform includes support for USB 3.1
[2360.10 → 2363.52] with type c ports so that stuff is not
[2363.52 → 2366.22] going to be apple exclusive for long
[2366.22 → 2368.10] which is well it's not exclusive now i
[2368.10 → 2369.32] mean there's a Chromebook but who cares
[2369.32 → 2371.92] uh no, no oh can I say that here are
[2371.92 → 2372.34] they're listening
[2372.34 → 2377.42] oh dear someone comes through the door
[2377.42 → 2378.20] we're taking your internet
[2378.20 → 2381.04] yeah yeah you like that gigabit
[2381.04 → 2382.50] internet you're on right now yeah you
[2382.50 → 2385.18] like that you like that bitch give it
[2385.18 → 2388.96] up now um so I've got our last bit of
[2388.96 → 2391.86] intel news and this is you know
[2391.86 → 2393.54] i don't know i don't know what to say
[2393.54 → 2396.86] about this intel plans job cuts across the
[2396.86 → 2398.66] company this is posted by joss on the
[2398.66 → 2401.48] forum um says an internal memo and they
[2401.48 → 2403.78] plan to reduce r d spending, so this is a
[2403.78 → 2405.26] confidential internal memo that
[2405.26 → 2406.60] indicates that intel wants to keep
[2406.60 → 2408.94] expenses flat to match its reduced
[2408.94 → 2411.48] revenue outlook for 2015 citing plans
[2411.48 → 2413.16] it announced in April to cut its research
[2413.16 → 2415.34] and administration budget by 300 million
[2415.34 → 2417.26] this year doesn't say how many people
[2417.26 → 2418.80] will lose jobs but said the cuts will
[2418.80 → 2420.94] begin June 15th so that was four days
[2420.94 → 2423.96] ago and conclude one month later laid off
[2423.96 → 2425.40] employees will receive a minimum of two
[2425.40 → 2426.84] months pay according to the memo plus
[2426.84 → 2428.30] extended health insurance and additional
[2428.30 → 2429.96] payments based on their time with intel
[2429.96 → 2432.20] in exchange for release of any claims
[2432.20 → 2435.72] against the company um no one has been
[2435.72 → 2438.60] notified uh or no excuse me not no one
[2438.60 → 2440.98] but um if you're losing your job there's a
[2440.98 → 2442.26] very good chance you haven't been notified
[2442.26 → 2444.34] yet and i have to kind of look at this and
[2444.34 → 2450.08] go was intel really expecting eight
[2450.08 → 2452.00] percent performance improvements year over
[2452.00 → 2454.30] year to drive CPU sales
[2454.30 → 2460.76] yeah what did they expect the mainstream is
[2460.76 → 2464.90] getting bigger and Bradwell desktop is a
[2464.90 → 2467.62] great example of this the mainstream is
[2467.62 → 2470.38] getting better graphics performance that
[2470.38 → 2473.66] they never asked for yeah and the guys
[2473.66 → 2475.92] that are because you can talk about how
[2475.92 → 2478.40] small the enthusiast segment is all day and
[2478.40 → 2481.44] it is the guys that are out there buying you
[2481.44 → 2484.94] know 5960x extreme editions are few and far
[2484.94 → 2489.00] between their grains of sand in an ocean but
[2489.00 → 2494.34] they are influencers and intel has made it hard to
[2494.34 → 2499.24] get excited about their CPUs for a long time now and
[2499.24 → 2501.42] influencers aren't going to be like running
[2501.42 → 2504.34] around telling all their buddies that their new CPU
[2504.34 → 2507.26] is so great, and it makes their gaming experience so
[2507.26 → 2509.26] awesome, and they need to upgrade they're not going
[2509.26 → 2511.26] to be doing that if you don't keep them excited and
[2511.26 → 2515.70] i i i hope that as part of you know cutting
[2515.70 → 2518.48] costs and the strategic things that they're doing
[2518.48 → 2521.50] there i hope they're also taking a look at
[2521.50 → 2525.18] what makes intel sexy stuff like the 750 SSD
[2525.18 → 2528.00] doesn't necessarily show up positively on a
[2528.00 → 2530.14] balance sheet because there's like a handful of
[2530.14 → 2532.10] motherboards that can even use the stupid thing not
[2532.10 → 2534.90] to mention that it's really expensive but what it does is
[2534.90 → 2537.86] it gets people talking about intel's innovation and
[2537.86 → 2540.56] leadership and SSD i mean intel's lucky that AMD's been
[2540.56 → 2545.16] sitting on their ass for the last five years um with that
[2545.16 → 2548.08] said i think that brings us really well into another topic
[2548.08 → 2552.00] here that oh i don't actually okay this one i don't think is in
[2552.00 → 2559.52] the doc but AMD has committed to full meat like CPU not an
[2559.52 → 2565.30] APU with the upcoming zen so if it's wouldn't be the first time
[2565.30 → 2569.26] that intel fell asleep at the wheel a little bit and kind of went yeah it's
[2569.26 → 2572.52] good enough uh let's focus on like making graphics better which is
[2572.52 → 2576.14] important especially and AMD believes it's important too let's just be
[2576.14 → 2580.36] sorry you want to hang out this to me oh uh which one the article
[2580.36 → 2583.78] oh uh there's a post on the forum i actually don't have it up
[2583.78 → 2589.16] uh I'm just going from memory just to be clear AMD and intel are and apple for
[2589.16 → 2594.40] that matter all on the same page about GPU performance actually being a huge
[2594.40 → 2597.74] driving force for the feature i mean apple was showing off their metal API
[2597.74 → 2601.94] um at their worldwide developer conference talking about huge performance
[2601.94 → 2608.36] improvements in like real work like not just you know running YouTube videos on
[2608.36 → 2613.72] the internet or whatever like real work things like the adobe suite um thanks to
[2613.72 → 2617.98] metal so I'm not saying that what intel's doing isn't really, really important and
[2617.98 → 2622.88] valuable with these great GPUs built into their CPUs I'm just saying it's not sexy
[2622.88 → 2629.86] um because it's its not there's no like what is the upgrade itch you know like as
[2629.86 → 2633.88] enthusiasts i feel like we all kind of we all kind of know what we're talking about
[2633.88 → 2638.16] right like yeah this hardware is like great, and it's cool, but that's what
[2638.16 → 2641.86] apple's so good at they make it sexy they make it exciting even if the hardware
[2641.86 → 2647.12] isn't new and isn't exciting and i feel like i feel like intel's just kind of lost
[2647.12 → 2650.82] that a little bit over the last while and uh it wouldn't be the first time that
[2650.82 → 2655.20] intel was like i said kind of asleep at the wheel and AMD showed up out of
[2655.20 → 2660.26] nowhere and took a chunk of their lunch let's face it AMD has never really
[2660.26 → 2665.22] been you know head to head with intel, but they've at least been like a great number
[2665.22 → 2669.92] two at times and even though you know for the tech-savvy the better choice at times
[2669.92 → 2674.82] um and i would love to see that happen again with zen as much because i you know
[2674.82 → 2678.92] would love to run a zen processor as because i would love for intel to wake up
[2678.92 → 2681.60] and kick some ass and Conroe us again you know
[2681.60 → 2687.04] just anything exciting in the pc space right now would be super great
[2687.04 → 2692.68] everything's extremely expected all across the board as far as i can tell
[2692.68 → 2699.28] speaking of things that are expected the wan show pretty much always has
[2699.28 → 2699.92] sponsors
[2699.92 → 2706.82] so we'll start with lynda.com and i guess Luke's on uh Luke's on changing frame
[2706.82 → 2710.68] duty can't see what you're doing so it's done we're good you're awesome
[2710.68 → 2714.40] and you know what else is awesome lynda.com it's just buying millions of people
[2714.40 → 2717.76] around the world with more than three thousand courses available they've
[2717.76 → 2721.42] continued to develop in the time that we've been working with them so they've
[2721.42 → 2726.84] continued to add more industry experts uh more courses more features you can
[2726.84 → 2731.32] create playlists uh that you can actually go through, and you can sort of tailor
[2731.32 → 2735.30] your learning experience according to what it is exactly that you want to do you
[2735.30 → 2738.64] can work on your own time, and they've improved being able to learn on your own
[2738.64 → 2742.76] time by allowing you to download courses and watch them on iOS or android
[2742.76 → 2747.08] devices sorry go ahead i love that yeah download courses that's super cool
[2747.08 → 2751.96] that's super awesome it's like it's like the good kind of DRM it's like yes this
[2751.96 → 2754.42] is our content you have to pay to use it but like
[2754.42 → 2758.94] you can use it in a way that's convenient for you yeah so I've actually had a not
[2758.94 → 2762.84] insignificant amount of people come up to me at shows and be like hey
[2762.84 → 2767.50] i kind of hope you don't mind but i don't watch any of your videos on any
[2767.50 → 2773.16] platform because i download them because they're like i want to watch them at work
[2773.16 → 2777.92] or whatever and i don't get sell there for whatever reason because i have x and y
[2777.92 → 2780.22] type of job and I'm like whatever man that's cool
[2780.22 → 2784.28] yeah we want you guys watching that's the most important thing i mean we'd love
[2784.28 → 2787.80] for you to watch us on you know a monetized platform if you can
[2787.80 → 2791.80] but if for whatever reason you can't, we'd sure as hell rather you watch than not
[2791.80 → 2797.68] watch yes yeah um so plans started only 25 a month for Linda head over to linda.com
[2797.68 → 2802.74] slash wan show to try it out for free for 10 days and if anyone from Linda's
[2802.74 → 2806.26] watching this we want a longer free trial because i know there's one other place
[2806.26 → 2811.86] where you can actually get a longer one so Linda we want to offer our viewers a
[2811.86 → 2813.84] longer free trial because the service is really awesome
[2813.84 → 2819.04] yeah um next up we've got squarespace is what is freaking is
[2819.04 → 2822.16] actually we've got a proposal into Squarespace for something really cool
[2822.16 → 2826.04] that would have us like building a site that would have some really cool
[2826.04 → 2829.64] functionality anyway i don't want to it's it hasn't been accepted yet or anything
[2829.64 → 2831.98] like that, but we love working with those guys because
[2831.98 → 2836.74] they're just all about the right things they're about making the web work better
[2836.74 → 2840.94] and be faster and be a smoother experience to get more people online and
[2840.94 → 2845.50] whether it's creating a blog or making a store to sell their little widgets
[2845.50 → 2849.24] that they create in their garage or just like getting out there and
[2849.24 → 2852.68] connecting with people they make creating a website easy and affordable at only
[2852.68 → 2856.24] eight dollars a month you get a free domain if you sign up for a year and you
[2856.24 → 2861.20] get 10 off your first purchase if you use offer code Linus over at squarespace.com
[2861.20 → 2864.56] so if you don't have a website Luke's highlighting the Squarespace build it
[2864.56 → 2867.22] beautiful thing all right I'll say it Squarespace build it beautiful
[2867.22 → 2876.36] yes you're so funny um i can't because like i can't see Luke but i can see his cursor in the dock
[2876.36 → 2882.28] and last up today we've got fresh books it's the online tool to get your accounting done quickly
[2882.28 → 2888.38] these guys love you guys, and they keep sort of they keep throwing these sponsor spots at us because
[2888.38 → 2895.08] they keep finding so many of you guys who are using fresh books whether it's because you or someone
[2895.08 → 2901.16] you know is running your own business, and you don't feel like mucking about with all that accounting
[2901.16 → 2906.56] crap and logging timesheets and logging receipts and then trying to remember where everything is
[2906.56 → 2911.48] fresh books is the online tool that allows you to keep track of your hours in your business
[2911.48 → 2916.52] and your billing get your customers to pay you by credit card see when they've received the bill
[2916.52 → 2922.14] and just take care of those little details so that you don't have to do that, and instead you can focus
[2922.14 → 2930.94] on installing showers or um you know framing buildings or whatever it is you're doing as a
[2930.94 → 2936.88] as a contractor or as a self-employed person so head over to freshbooks.com slash when and enter when
[2936.88 → 2941.66] in how did you hear about us section when you sign up for your free trial there's a free trial i
[2941.66 → 2949.86] forgot about that yes all right what's our next topic here i am lost in the dock now okay it's okay i got
[2949.86 → 2955.98] this right radio on r9 300 series speaking of exciting things that AMD is doing um so AMD did
[2955.98 → 2962.56] everything from completely pointless and horrible to actually looking pretty darn exciting over the last
[2962.56 → 2970.46] week with the launch of the r9 300 series and the r9 fury series so we'll start with r9 300 because
[2970.46 → 2979.84] um we can go through this pretty quickly it's posted by z mule and um yeah so the r9
[2979.84 → 2990.94] uh excuse me uh excuse me the r7 260 is now the r7 360 the HD 7850 is now the r7 370
[2990.94 → 3002.54] the r9 285 is now the r9 380 so at least they've acknowledged that um yeah it is sort of lower
[3002.54 → 3011.04] uh the r9 290x is now the r9 390x and uh the 390 and 390x now come with 8 gigs of memory not that we
[3011.04 → 3017.46] haven't had 8 gig 290x cards for months now and memory bandwidth was increased from 5 to 6 gigabit
[3017.46 → 3024.84] per second likely just thanks to better yields on that stuff and AMD's MSRP and this is a is a big
[3024.84 → 3031.88] gigantic wheelbarrow full of fail are actually higher than the street prices for certain cards
[3031.88 → 3037.80] um at retailers right now so if you were thinking hey I'd sure love to have a r9 390x then you should
[3037.80 → 3047.00] probably go to Amazon using our code by the way uh buy a 290x and then draw a 3 on it because while
[3047.00 → 3054.10] there were some rumours that the 390 and 390x had actually improved the GPU compared to the 290 and
[3054.10 → 3062.42] 290x um there's already rumour debunking stuff showing up right now in fact um the driver thing
[3062.42 → 3066.52] you're talking about yeah that's the one I'm gonna I'm going to pull up right now I'm gonna post this link
[3066.52 → 3074.62] uh oh i don't actually have the i don't have I don't have the link to uh to hard OCP but whatever I'll
[3074.62 → 3079.90] just I'll post I'll post what i have here you guys um so it looks like it was a driver tweak
[3079.90 → 3087.80] and uh an enterprising individual out there found a way to make the 390 launch driver run on the 290x
[3087.80 → 3094.72] and the tessellation performance improvements that came with the 300 series uh are mirrored exactly on
[3094.72 → 3102.30] the 29 200 series once the driver like why do they even bother why do these companies even bother
[3102.30 → 3111.02] we're going to find out yeah like the pc tech media and I'm not even like I'm not even including myself
[3111.02 → 3119.72] here like some of those guys are really, really smart like really smart like you are not and even if they
[3119.72 → 3126.66] don't grab it like a lot of the end users are really, really smart, and we'll figure it out if is is we
[3126.66 → 3131.58] that's right you know guys like between the professionals you know the guys like a Scott
[3131.58 → 3138.20] Wasson or Ryan shroud or Ryan smith between those guys and between the really smart end users that are
[3138.20 → 3145.18] out there how can you possibly expect to get to pretend that tessellation performance improved when
[3145.18 → 3155.44] it's a driver tweak um yeah so anyway uh let's talk r9 theory because this is where things actually
[3155.44 → 3160.86] get quite a bit more interesting so big strewn posted the original article on Linus tech tips here
[3160.86 → 3166.80] and it's from legit reviews which i have gone ahead and posted in the twitch chat so the performance of
[3166.80 → 3175.96] any card running the new Fiji GPU is still under NDA until it's released uh the r9 until the r9 fury x is
[3175.96 → 3183.46] released on June 24th so to be clear uh fury x2 which is just a placeholder name for the dual GPU Fiji
[3183.46 → 3192.32] card that's rumoured to be coming out in the fall and um has been pictured is one of them, and then we're
[3192.32 → 3201.70] also getting a r9 fury x and a r9 fury so what can we just make the naming scheme even more confusing
[3201.70 → 3209.02] yeah what the hell why didn't they just make life i mean the thing that i think companies
[3209.02 → 3216.82] miss sometimes is like why something worked it's like yeah it's like if BMW released like a super
[3216.82 → 3222.12] awesome car and a bunch of people bought it and let's say it was called like the know the x
[3222.12 → 3231.60] six or something and Nissan's like yeah let's call our next series the x6 e for like evolution
[3231.60 → 3239.74] and like it's like not as good of a car yeah copying someone else's naming scheme and and and product
[3239.74 → 3247.26] tiering structure is not going to work it not doesn't work that way the titan wasn't successful
[3247.26 → 3252.74] because it was called a titan they should have made it what in mythology killed the titans
[3252.74 → 3261.80] um wasn't there a thing i can't remember i actually like the throwback branding now to be clear if they
[3261.80 → 3267.06] were going to have something that was like a truly you know head and shoulders above everything
[3267.06 → 3273.32] else product i actually don't mind them calling it like a rage or a fury or like a r9 max or like
[3273.32 → 3281.62] like a throwback to the hit race it's just that it's the only new card and the rumours have
[3281.62 → 3289.64] the performance competitive with GTX 980 ti so you can't titan was titan because there was nothing it
[3289.64 → 3297.14] was competing against not because they just called it titan so for fury to be a fury and to truly be
[3297.14 → 3303.08] different from it would have to compete against something that's really different now you can
[3303.08 → 3309.10] make the argument that if fury x is competitive with GTX 980 ti then it's pretty damn competitive
[3309.10 → 3315.20] with titan x but i also think titan x is stupid and people who bought titan x's should feel pretty
[3315.20 → 3321.80] bad right now not because they're dumb but because NVIDIA didn't really give them a value in the way
[3321.80 → 3326.76] that they did with the original titan which had the better double precision performance in addition
[3326.76 → 3333.84] to the larger frame buffer and the fact that you got you know big Kepler performance a significant
[3333.84 → 3338.88] amount of time before anyone else got big Kepler performance at least not an affordable price
[3338.88 → 3345.20] uh where am I going with all this right, right specs for r9 fury x do you want to run through this i
[3345.20 → 3350.22] feel like I've been talking forever I'm sorry when i can't see you it's hard to see when i can't see
[3350.22 → 3354.66] you it's so easy to talk over you, I'm sorry i know, but it's actually been okay because i never
[3354.66 → 3361.22] control the screen so I'm just so lost in like usually i have like all my notes on my screen I'm
[3361.22 → 3366.16] just like all right this is how i work and i don't navigate websites so i spent a lot of this time
[3366.16 → 3372.70] just being like am I supposed to be scrolling right now or like what do i have no idea what's
[3372.70 → 3376.62] supposed to be happening I've been having the opposite experience I've been like oh this is great
[3376.62 → 3381.20] i have my webcam like right above my notes i can just like look right at my notes i don't have to
[3381.20 → 3386.58] remember jack yeah because usually what I'm doing is i read the chat to make sure everything's going
[3386.58 → 3391.30] fine and like make sure the thing's stable and the audio is level and i every we're not screwing
[3391.30 → 3396.50] anything up and like so i haven't been monitoring the chat I'm scrolling through it's weird um i don't
[3396.50 → 3401.98] even know where the specs are like in the oh scroll down a little bit all right they're right there
[3401.98 → 3406.58] i can do it if you want to go for it, and maybe I'll just jump in probably all right so we've got
[3406.58 → 3414.82] 4096 stream processors running at 10 50 megahertz 64 compute units 2565 texture units 64 crops and
[3414.82 → 3420.34] blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah i can talk about the game stuff yeah, so this is cool it's only
[3420.34 → 3427.10] it's less than 20 centimetres so just over seven and a half inches in length which to me is kind of
[3427.10 → 3432.92] merits a penis extension of some sort I'm sure it's going to mod something like that um yes and no because
[3432.92 → 3439.84] um look at what we've been doing lately a lot of tiny computers compact builds the most
[3439.84 → 3444.34] fun thing we did in the last little while was that little tiny ridiculous Silverstone case
[3444.34 → 3450.18] and you know what they can make those even smaller yes you're able to use some 700 watt SFX or even
[3450.18 → 3455.62] their really insane density 600 watt and then an it motherboard and then a short ass graphics card
[3455.62 → 3461.28] and then you throw a Bradwell desktop on there and all of a sudden you've got a 65 watt
[3461.28 → 3465.72] TDP on your CPU you don't even need to liquid cool your CPU or even put a decent cooler on it
[3465.72 → 3471.94] your GPU can have that one 120 millimetre fan cooling slot that can actually take up the space
[3471.94 → 3477.18] where the butt-end of your graphics card would have normally been i might get my PlayStation 2 size
[3477.18 → 3483.94] computer at some point here with a pretty significant uh GPU kick because if this was
[3483.94 → 3489.62] two years ago i would have been completely on board with what you just said I'm like oh it's a short
[3489.62 → 3495.26] card that's going to look super stupid because i was one of like the bigger haters of the whatever
[3495.26 → 3502.88] that card was you run a 800d yes, and you're thinking of the 670 the short CPU yeah i hated
[3502.88 → 3510.60] that the performance grade NVIDIA like short class card that bugged me so much but yeah i think it would
[3510.60 → 3516.18] be fine now but so many people are building smaller builds yep like looking at my 800d now it's just like
[3516.18 → 3519.54] the only reason why i have that is because i haven't upgraded anything in my computer in a long
[3519.54 → 3526.14] time so AMD has way overdone the cooling they've got a safe gentle typhoon yeah type fan on if it's
[3526.14 → 3531.92] 120 millimetre rad uh the thermal limit of the GPU is apparently 75 degrees so they want to keep it
[3531.92 → 3539.84] cool for some reason very interesting um it has a 275 watt TDP with a 500 watt capable cooler at the at
[3539.84 → 3546.18] the at the target please don't go higher than this temperature yeah very interesting um the r9 fury
[3546.18 → 3554.42] non-x uh we don't have as much detail about so fewer course than the x, and it does not have a reference
[3554.42 → 3560.68] design we've seen NVIDIA do this kind of thing before oh apparently they want Luke to turn mic volume
[3560.68 → 3567.48] up i know oh i don't know if i can okay i can turn myself down a little i just i can never
[3567.48 → 3572.78] volume dial on this thing is for my monitoring isn't it there maybe that's a little better bit
[3572.78 → 3579.02] better okay so um blah blah blah blah blah blah right we've seen NVIDIA do this before where every
[3579.02 → 3585.46] card will be a non-reference card and quite frankly it probably makes sense in this case since um
[3585.46 → 3590.20] if they were doing a reference card I'm assuming on a lower cost card like this they would want to do
[3590.20 → 3596.64] a blower design and the after market guys are going to want to put open air coolers on them, and they're
[3596.64 → 3600.14] not going to want to sell blowers anyway and the blower is probably not going to be that effective
[3600.14 → 3606.48] if the TDP is anywhere near the uh the 290 or the uh the fury x i mean even you know we saw the same
[3606.48 → 3615.40] thing with titan x like it's yeah that cooler design is great on a 980 not as great on a titan x or
[3615.40 → 3621.50] not great at all that's why oh I'm I'm I'm highly frustrated with total right now i love those guys
[3621.50 → 3628.16] but they really should have sent me the arctic storm titan x because i really want to see what
[3628.16 → 3635.24] you can do with like a good not that air cooler on a titan x you know what we uh we have two titan x's
[3635.24 → 3640.12] we could sacrifice one of them to the water block gods maybe just um you know what maybe we could do
[3640.12 → 3644.04] some maybe we could do like some water cooling content over the next little bit here because
[3644.04 → 3649.80] you wanted to oh i can't reveal that okay well whatever there could be some water cooling content coming
[3649.80 → 3655.32] yes okay so let's talk let's talk Fiji architecture for a little bit here run away
[3655.32 → 3661.18] AMD says it took nearly seven years to develop um they're thinking about releasing all the data
[3661.18 → 3666.26] needed to 3d print your own side covers for the card shroud which is pretty neat um encouraging
[3666.26 → 3669.98] modding is always something that looks good for these companies to do and cost them nothing
[3669.98 → 3675.10] um AMD put nine led son the back of a card that allow you to see GPU load level it's not the first
[3675.10 → 3679.54] time we've seen something like this there's uh two dip switches on the backplate that allow you to
[3679.54 → 3684.02] enable or disable the GPU tack and allows you to change the colour of the LEDs between red and blue
[3684.02 → 3689.76] to match your case theme better there's also a light that goes on if their zero core power mode is
[3689.76 → 3694.76] enabled um one thing that i really like started jumping here is that they did the like nine little
[3694.76 → 3703.14] LEDs for load level because one thing that's been driving me insane is multicoloured RGB load level
[3703.14 → 3710.84] indicators on cards it's like what the hell i don't want my like all red and black badass card
[3710.84 → 3717.48] in my all red and black badass system to randomly be like green right no what are you doing this is
[3717.48 → 3726.16] not Christmas i am playing games or i am not playing games stop it so I'm I'm very happy with the
[3726.16 → 3732.42] little like line of LEDs idea like how hard can you hit the hammer make the thing go up style instead
[3732.42 → 3741.16] of multicoloured LEDs right um so on to more Fiji architecture stuff this is really a
[3741.16 → 3747.76] little disappointing actually um the GPU does not support HDMI 2.0 it is running HDMI 1.4a with that
[3747.76 → 3754.80] said i can't really think of a no i can think of a reason it would be really nice for TVs with HDMI 2.0
[3754.80 → 3759.66] like if you want to game on a TV uh it's going to be hard to find a DisplayPort TV it would have
[3759.66 → 3766.48] been super sick if you could uh if you could handle 4k 60 hertz on a TV so that's like sort of kind of
[3766.48 → 3774.24] disappoint um, but there's other really cool stuff so for the i don't know first time in a while i guess
[3774.24 → 3782.32] AMD has really leapfrogged NVIDIA in a way that I'm sure NVIDIA is going to be playing down to the
[3782.32 → 3788.94] best of their ability because NVIDIA is still on DDR and AMD has spent a lot of time and a lot of
[3788.94 → 3796.64] effort on HBM so that's their high bandwidth memory technology um so what this is effectively the
[3796.64 → 3802.10] ram is sitting like physically it's actually physically smaller because they're stacking it
[3802.10 → 3809.28] instead of laying it out flat, and it is physically closer to the GPU for much, much higher memory
[3809.28 → 3818.16] bandwidth than we've seen before with that said um memory bandwidth overclocking has typically not
[3818.16 → 3824.36] done a lot not mostly me and Luke over the last couple of years, but there are benefits that
[3824.36 → 3830.28] might not be immediately apparent, so the power consumption savings are a big one the fact that
[3830.28 → 3836.08] you can now take more of your power tuning and throw it at the GPU instead of the memory since
[3836.08 → 3840.54] you're limited by how much the PCI Express specification allows you to pull through a slot
[3840.54 → 3847.08] and the and the power plugs that go into it so that's a benefit and i mean i guess well that's
[3847.08 → 3851.82] that's a big benefit and what we can do with more memory bandwidth in the future is something that is
[3851.82 → 3859.20] yet to be unlocked by developers and so more is better one problem that AMD is downplaying
[3859.20 → 3867.42] hardcore right now and I'm really not sure if i agree with is that r9 fury x and r9 fury are going to
[3867.42 → 3877.92] launch with four gigs memory max so four one gig uh stacks next to the GPU um and with AMD sort of
[3877.92 → 3885.06] trumpeting the benefits of four gig back when they launched Hawaii with the 290x uh for 4k gaming
[3885.06 → 3892.38] and kind of going yep four gigs is still enough when NVIDIA has traditionally been the one to let
[3892.38 → 3898.58] AMD throw more memory at their cards and then um kind of put the right amount of memory per GPU
[3898.58 → 3904.70] um to have AMD kind of going yep, yep four gigs is enough um, but we're gonna work on eight gigs later
[3904.70 → 3910.34] is a bit of a difficult message for me to swallow but i understand why whether it's yields or whether
[3910.34 → 3916.42] it's pure availability of chips they aren't able to do an uh we've been talking about doing this for a
[3916.42 → 3923.54] little while now and it's complicated but we should do a deeper dive how much VRAM are we using in
[3923.54 → 3930.16] different situations video um NCI tech tips actually did one not that long ago um and the truth of the
[3930.16 → 3936.34] matter is that even gaming at 4k you are very unlikely to exceed four gigs of memory usage yeah but
[3936.34 → 3943.42] the problem with that is you can get damn close today and there are a lot of games like look
[3943.42 → 3950.32] at how p3 e3 was yeah there are a lot of games and a lot of games like Grand Theft Auto 5 that are
[3950.32 → 3954.34] going to have a lot of mods that are going to ask for a lot of video memory and if you could add super
[3954.34 → 3960.58] fast and i know people that have gotten over four gigs with Skyrim absolutely oh yeah for sure like
[3960.58 → 3968.12] a lot of times yep so i mean that was how AMD justified the release of the r9 290x with eight
[3968.12 → 3973.88] gigs and then the funny part here is that 390 and 390x fly right in the face of that message that four
[3973.88 → 3980.54] gigs is enough these are lower end cards that AMD is throwing eight gigs of memory at yeah so that's
[3980.54 → 3986.44] pretty brutal yeah i mean it's all going to come down to performance and at the end of the day
[3986.44 → 3993.44] if the fury x crushes the 980 ti even in spite of it's you know two gigs less memory i think a lot of
[3993.44 → 3997.64] people are going to run to it and the fact that the form factor is so different is a unique
[3997.64 → 4003.74] selling point for me um so i really like it, I'm excited to check it out uh it turns out ours is in
[4003.74 → 4010.90] the mail and is scheduled for delivery today oh okay so we have yet no it hasn't they sent it to my
[4010.90 → 4017.72] house because they're a bunch of people who don't ask where to ship things and don't tell me that
[4017.72 → 4021.92] they shipped it well they don't usually ship us things they're like I'm like yeah so i saw the
[4021.92 → 4026.64] review embargo date so are you planning to send one at all they're like oh yeah it's already in the mail
[4026.64 → 4030.70] like well don't you think maybe you should actually check with me before you mail things to me like
[4030.70 → 4035.54] what if and what if this was an alternate universe and i didn't have time like what if i actually
[4035.54 → 4039.74] wasn't going to have a video up would you would already be in the mail like don't you think you should
[4039.74 → 4044.74] check these things with people like what if i what is i broke my leg yesterday and i actually
[4044.74 → 4049.16] can't benchmark the fury x or some injury that would actually prevent me from benchmarking a
[4049.16 → 4058.08] graphics card yeah and hands yeah yeah yeah anyway so I'm hoping that my wife I'm hoping that
[4058.08 → 4064.28] they'll, they'll drop it um and my wife can can get it in time otherwise it'll show up Monday at my house
[4064.28 → 4071.10] which is super dumb because that'll give us like one day basically to make a video about it
[4071.10 → 4075.66] which is we've done it before i know, but it's not a good thing, and it's involved like
[4075.66 → 4087.00] copious amounts of overtime yeah um all right so moving on yeah moving on uh this was a really
[4087.00 → 4093.88] cool article uh posted on the forum by j bird, and it's the uh the features that apple didn't tell
[4093.88 → 4101.50] you about iOS 9 and some of them are like really cool and some of them are just like holy cow it took
[4101.50 → 4107.54] long enough um so you can pinch to zoom in and out on a video now uh they give you detailed battery
[4107.54 → 4115.16] usage for the last 24 and last 72 hours um you can do you can group notifications by app
[4115.16 → 4126.42] uh you can disable shake to undo yay um touch I'd protected passwords in safari uh there's some
[4126.42 → 4133.34] new stock apps uh quick reply for all apps um you can turn off all vibrations
[4133.34 → 4140.38] yeah keyboard keys you guys should check that out if you're an iPhone user it's definitely worth
[4140.38 → 4145.08] checking out because there's always the stuff in the keynote and then there's the actually like
[4145.08 → 4149.74] oh wow this is super useful i wish they'd mentioned it stuff after the fact when i was using my iPhone
[4149.74 → 4154.68] i immediately installed swift key iPhone didn't have up care case and lowercase keyboards
[4154.68 → 4162.54] what swift key for iOS the last time i used it was still kind of saraband though it's its bad but i
[4162.54 → 4168.58] switched anyway because it knew my typing profile and stuff right so i was like sure, but it was yeah i
[4168.58 → 4171.46] did not like that that was one of the things i really didn't like about the iPhone as a keyboard
[4171.46 → 4176.62] i mean last time around that was one of the big things it's like thank you finally
[4176.62 → 4183.96] support third party keyboards wish this had happened a long time ago yeah all right so let's talk input
[4183.96 → 4194.12] devices here this is a thing um third party fancy pants controllers have been available
[4194.12 → 4206.78] for some time um whether it's for the Xbox or PlayStation or pc or whatever but i have not yet seen a first party
[4206.78 → 4217.08] controller of this magnitude so the Xbox One elite controller was announced at e3 um it features four
[4217.08 → 4222.52] super interchangeable paddles around the back hair trigger locks for precise control and shooters
[4222.52 → 4228.70] recappable buttons completely swappable components including like you can change out the d-pad
[4228.70 → 4233.90] um stay the stainless steel paddles are removable but when they're attached they allow you to keep
[4233.90 → 4239.26] your fingers on the thumb sticks at all times we've seen like Jacky modded ones in the past that are just
[4239.26 → 4245.80] like they replicate the functionality of other buttons but um full customization of thumb stick sensitivity
[4245.80 → 4251.26] and minimum min slash max levels for the controller's top triggers and these settings along with
[4251.26 → 4257.52] button mapping are handled through a standalone app that will be released for Xbox One and Windows 10
[4257.52 → 4264.28] so with all this talk about valve's new controller and with the third party innovation that's happened
[4264.28 → 4271.34] and the fact that Microsoft other than you know making the original Xbox controller actually holdable
[4271.34 → 4277.22] by real people with normal size hands and then streamlining the Xbox 360 controllers it seems like
[4277.22 → 4285.06] Microsoft has taken notice and is actually maybe going to capture our attention with this Xbox One platform
[4285.06 → 4291.80] after all it's expensive as hell yeah it's 150 dollars if all that sounded great until the price i don't blame
[4291.80 → 4297.54] you yeah um your controller preferences are stored in the cloud the game pad itself can carry around two user
[4297.54 → 4305.42] profiles like it actually looks kind of badass but hey we got it we got a straw poll this um chat badass
[4305.42 → 4312.20] I'll create I'll create a straw poll um sure interested in and remember guys you don't have to be an Xbox
[4312.20 → 4317.32] gamer to buy this it's going to be for the pc the dongles coming the dongles announced for
[4317.32 → 4326.12] the pc the wireless dongle i controllers are super important even for pc guys if you want to play racing games
[4326.12 → 4331.70] if you want to play a lot of just action games i personally think assassin's creed plays better with a
[4331.70 → 4339.68] controller yeah i played team raider 2013 with a controller for sure um and speaking of racing games
[4339.68 → 4347.00] uh Logitech did announce the g29 at e3 i haven't actually looked into it a ton but I'm I'm hoping to
[4347.00 → 4351.92] get our hands on a review unit of that the problem is that they're releasing the oh crap i forget what
[4351.92 → 4358.96] they're calling it but the PlayStation exclusive one first um so i had kind of sent in a request for
[4358.96 → 4365.58] an engineering sample of the pc compatible and Xbox One and i haven't heard back or anything yet so
[4365.58 → 4373.52] look at these votes do you have this up no interested in buying an Xbox elite controller
[4373.52 → 4381.08] 38 of you at 150 here I'll send you the link I'm not crazy surprised
[4381.08 → 4388.94] um but I'm I'm a little surprised I'm very happy that turnip has at least 24 percent
[4388.94 → 4395.48] yeah vote for turnip you guys turnip is turnip is uh love and life and all that
[4395.48 → 4400.88] but 40 percent of you are interested in the Xbox elite controller this is a half-and-half mix that is a
[4400.88 → 4407.16] i mean obviously this isn't you know a painstakingly crafted you know market research survey but
[4407.16 → 4415.14] wow after working controllers are a thing i don't know i like really nice controllers i mean before
[4415.14 → 4422.98] Ben gate one of uh, uh unbox therapy's top uh top viewed videos was some Xbox controller yeah
[4422.98 → 4431.40] i forget which one it is uh Xbox controller I'll search for it the avenger oh no the scuff controller
[4431.40 → 4439.72] scuff yeah that makes sense no, no avenger elite was that's weird no end control avenger 5.7 million
[4439.72 → 4446.00] views was a play after market PlayStation 3 controllers with like it looks like a Swiss army knife yeah
[4446.00 → 4449.48] um what else we got today
[4449.48 → 4459.88] oh right the other big thing that Microsoft announced backwards compatibility for the Xbox One
[4459.88 → 4470.94] even servers wow dropping bombs at e3 i mean i think Luke you and i both agreed Nintendo won e3 last
[4470.94 → 4478.28] year right yeah not this year last year though this year i mean can you imagine this did Microsoft
[4478.28 → 4484.42] just win e3 wasn't there a ton of PlayStation game announcements i guess the pc yeah i guess it
[4484.42 → 4489.68] was just okay but come on i mean Sony's gonna Sony's downplaying this already because Sony has
[4489.68 → 4495.16] changed the architectural design of their consoles so dramatically from generation to generation particularly
[4495.16 → 4503.96] with the cell last gen yeah that emulation is just impossible like early PlayStation 3s needed PS2
[4503.96 → 4511.16] hardware in them and the PlayStation 4 never had any kind of backwards compatibility whatsoever yeah so
[4511.16 → 4518.10] Sony is obviously going to downplay this but backwards compatibility is huge i mean you look at any
[4518.10 → 4524.58] other art form, and we're thinking about we're like we're actively making efforts to preserve it
[4524.58 → 4533.22] and gaming short of pc emulation which is becoming less and less feasible over time as you know um
[4533.22 → 4538.18] alternative controller schemes like how are you going to play a Wii game unless you have a
[4538.18 → 4543.80] Wii mode if it's an actually Wii mode optimized game can you not hook a Wii mode up to a pc i think
[4543.80 → 4549.62] there's Jacky ways that you can like face do it, but it's its never going to be mainstream it's never
[4549.62 → 4555.76] going to be like um you know like the way that people buy a poster that's just we thought like
[4555.76 → 4563.58] eventually emulating Xbox One and PlayStation 4 shouldn't be that hard PS3 um i mean i don't I don't
[4563.58 → 4573.44] want to use the n-word but like that may never happen um and so for hardware particularly hardware
[4573.44 → 4579.42] with someone will figure out something but i doubt it'll ever be perfect in much the same way that
[4579.42 → 4584.44] even Nintendo 64 emulation is still not perfect it's just a little sketchy there's some there's
[4584.44 → 4589.64] some dips and ups and too much doesn't really run right yeah some games don't work right so
[4589.64 → 4594.18] particularly if the device that runs your art form i mean if we treat games like art
[4594.18 → 4603.00] has an optical drive in it is will die so unless we're you know unless all of these guys have like
[4603.00 → 4608.80] a warehouse of pristine condition consoles or have plans to open source the hardware at some point
[4608.80 → 4614.76] so people can continue to enjoy this content for like let's not even think years let's think decades
[4614.76 → 4619.40] or let's think you know centuries from now it's not like we don't appreciate art from
[4619.40 → 4625.62] you know the Middle Ages how are we going to preserve PlayStation 1 gaming for our children's
[4625.62 → 4630.98] children's children i don't know it's its an interesting question because you look at what's
[4630.98 → 4637.00] happened to a lot of the old consoles it just doesn't exist anymore, or you're doing like what
[4637.00 → 4643.12] I'm doing which is just hoard old consoles and old games and even that's going to be limited to guys
[4643.12 → 4648.06] who have like in the case of cartridges you're limited in some cases to guys who have the skills
[4648.06 → 4654.28] to like solder new batteries into things yeah i mean they barely work and that's that's a lot better
[4654.28 → 4662.34] than an optical drive yeah i have a number of n's games that you can't um the like internal batteries
[4662.34 → 4670.92] or whatnot are dead and or even SNES games exactly and the pc is much, much better at this uh thanks to
[4670.92 → 4678.16] the boat anchor that holds us back in a lot of ways that is x86 but these completely closed garden
[4678.16 → 4690.22] consoles are just going to fade into obscurity i don't know i worry about that yeah well i don't know i
[4690.22 → 4695.54] do we have any more topics uh i think that was everything i really wanted to get through
[4695.54 → 4702.12] uh oh yeah I've got it this is just kind of a fun one so i really hope i don't offend any of you
[4702.12 → 4709.76] but this is like the world's saddest thing ever um real doll is a company making silicone sex dolls
[4709.76 → 4715.98] and they are upgrading them significantly and i don't mean upgrading your sex doll
[4715.98 → 4726.14] can you chat with them remotely so um they are making AI heads for their existing silicone
[4726.14 → 4735.16] sex doll object things that will kind of act like they like what you're doing uh with plans
[4735.16 → 4740.96] to release, and so they're planning to have those available by 2017 with plans to release full body
[4740.96 → 4749.96] animated sex bots um in the future that will cost up to 77 000 now what i can say is that's nothing
[4749.96 → 4753.16] compared to a real woman but
[4753.16 → 4765.14] come on really uh the article here is from new.com Australia and the funny thing is that
[4765.16 → 4770.18] about anything sex related is there's always going to be like uh like a expert you know that
[4770.18 → 4776.06] they contact for comment on an article like this and the thing about experts is that with very few
[4776.06 → 4782.60] exceptions a lot of this is pseudoscientific nonsense um so you could find a expert to agree
[4782.60 → 4789.88] with you on anything doesn't matter so they probably went out and contacted a half a dozens experts
[4789.88 → 4793.78] and just found one that thought this was a good idea and one that thought it was a bad idea
[4793.78 → 4796.92] and the one that thought it was a good idea was just like oh well yeah you know
[4796.92 → 4802.94] you know for some people interacting with other people is you know whether they're like busy at
[4802.94 → 4812.24] work is not as good as having a silicone doll and like that's I'm like really i mean
[4812.24 → 4818.66] maybe maybe maybe I'm going to be like one of those like weird people maybe you're the caveman yeah i don't
[4818.66 → 4823.98] think i can scroll down any more maybe I'm the caveman so i want to hear from you guys straw poll
[4823.98 → 4841.08] yeah sex doll uh yes uh to augment uh RL relationship yes to replace no and everyone's favourite turnip
[4841.08 → 4850.94] and this is just general turnip as in like i don't care at all do whatever you want bro well yeah okay
[4850.94 → 4855.84] that's another thing I'm not saying they should be illegal or anything just to be clear when i say
[4855.84 → 4862.44] yuck i mean me personally yuck i don't mean that you can't do whatever you want but i also think that
[4862.44 → 4866.28] if we were to if you were like my bro, and we were to sit down and have a heart-to-heart
[4866.28 → 4871.90] you know like let's just like let's talk about whether this is a good idea you know for your
[4871.90 → 4877.88] well-being I'd be like i don't think this is a good idea i think that having real contact with
[4877.88 → 4886.32] real people are important even if we do it digitally like i think something like skype to you is
[4886.32 → 4892.42] better than just talking to in to an AI um and in much the same way that having a relationship with a
[4892.42 → 4900.66] person is just even if it's just like practice skyping might even be skyping to a real person
[4900.66 → 4906.16] might not even be as constructive emotionally as talking to an AI in person depending on how
[4906.16 → 4914.38] developed the AI is it's a good point okay so let's post it uh oh, oh did I not post it i don't think
[4914.38 → 4923.02] so i thought i did oh I'll people are voting yeah um and i mean here's the thing too though is what
[4923.02 → 4930.92] we're talking about right now is year 2017 AI i don't think anyone should spend 77 000 on that AI
[4930.92 → 4933.74] right in particular yeah
[4933.74 → 4941.96] yeah I'm I'm sure it's going to be trash but it's like the early adopter idea probably i would assume
[4941.96 → 4948.32] it must be because it's going to be terrible like look at uh even like hugely commercialized
[4948.32 → 4955.36] solutions where it's not like a very, very narrow market any form of AI or like voice control
[4955.36 → 4961.30] even voice detection is just garbage so like what do you expect from if it's not going to be great
[4961.30 → 4967.96] all right so uh 42 percent of you are on the turnip bandwagon with 32 percent of you saying no
[4967.96 → 4974.34] um 17 percent of you saying yes to augment a real life relationship and let's face it there's lots
[4974.34 → 4982.00] of people out there that have sex dolls like it's its a thing it exists um and i mean it's its one of
[4982.00 → 4985.74] those things where i guess you know as long as you're sort of honest with each other and as long as
[4985.74 → 4989.92] everyone's like cool then that's that's great, and then we've got 10 percent of you saying yes
[4989.92 → 4997.32] you know I'm I'm too busy or i it's not my fang I'm not a people person yes that that is a that is an
[4997.32 → 5001.34] acceptable substitute for me very interesting well there you go it's always nice to hear from you
[5001.34 → 5006.16] guys because you can open my eyes a lot of the time i mean I'm the one hosting the show and Luke's
[5006.16 → 5011.10] hosting the show but a lot of the times it's you guys sort of telling us like what's actually going
[5011.10 → 5014.98] on out there because we're only we're only two people I'm pretty excited that we're talking about
[5014.98 → 5024.74] sex dolls in front of 6533 people I'm pretty excited that um those people might get to watch me
[5024.74 → 5030.22] and a sex doll in the after party actually no that's not happening um yeah no, thank you all
[5030.22 → 5036.34] very much in after party ever yeah I'm actually probably not doing an after party because i think
[5036.34 → 5040.10] like there's someone pacing outside this conference room i think i told them i was going to be done at
[5040.10 → 5047.06] six, and it is now 605 um so i think that's pretty much it for the show today guys thank you all so much
