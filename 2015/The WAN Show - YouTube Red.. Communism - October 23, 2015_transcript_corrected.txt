[0.00 → 9.72] all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to the wand show start your coolers start your
[9.72 → 16.94] engines running wait no motor is usually the know get your engine get your motor running oh
[16.94 → 22.26] yeah like we get your motor running yeah we crank your we crank your engine okay
[22.26 → 26.36] crank engine could kind of work we plug your tailpipe if you know what I mean
[26.36 → 35.96] anyway we have topics this week that are devoted cranking engines the first one is WD acquires
[35.96 → 47.22] tailpipes WD does not acquire tailpipes WD acquired SanDisk for 19 billion yeah they stuffed 19 billion
[47.22 → 56.34] up their tailpipe and that made them theirs prison rules man oh my god um also
[56.34 → 63.94] YouTube did something yeah red YouTube red it's different from YouTube blue it's less sad
[63.94 → 65.94] oh I feel bad for YouTube blue now
[65.94 → 73.94] yo listen up here's the story about a little I love that song guy that lived in the red world
[73.94 → 80.90] and he paid for YouTube and got some cool stuff except people don't like it, but we'll talk about
[80.90 → 85.78] that later sorry people don't like it Korean 10 terabyte piece i e and 8 terabyte SATA drives
[85.78 → 94.58] also the USA is enforcing mandatory drone registration well trying to more on that in a minute every time I say
[94.58 → 100.18] more on I'm like that must be a stupid news topic
[100.18 → 104.18] and intro
[104.18 → 110.18] maybe that's the person's last name more on that
[110.18 → 117.78] little minute
[117.78 → 135.38] visit gaming.logitech.com to learn more about like cool sweet Logitech stuff
[135.38 → 143.70] yeah also freshbooks.com for cool fresh book stuff yeah and dollarshaveclub.com
[143.70 → 148.98] slash Linus for cool dollar stuff oh wait sorry shaving that's what it is shaving and
[148.98 → 158.02] butt wiping okay and then I'm going to put this here see how I blanked it now it'll load right away next time
[158.02 → 163.54] what you just have to remember mp4 at the top no i did i did because that's the end screen
[164.18 → 171.46] of the intro mp4, but we always forget to do that well technically I'm not the one that's in control
[171.46 → 182.42] yeah technically maybe if you would actually um you know tail pipe I don't know where I'm going with this
[183.38 → 187.94] uh so we've got a great show for you guys today we've got a ton of topics uh some of which
[187.94 → 191.86] are interesting some of which are total white, but we won't talk about those for too long
[192.42 → 197.54] and um I'm getting an ad for wow scouts versus zombies that can't be good
[199.38 → 202.18] oh this looks like one of those terrible joke movies yeah
[204.18 → 208.90] scouts guide to the zombie apocalypse wow that looks awful sorry a bunch of people in chat were
[208.90 → 215.14] saying that they have no video feed um refresh the page everything is good I was just making sure it's
[215.14 → 222.26] working I've got a lot of people talking about Star Wars trailer hype I have not seen it what no, no no
[222.26 → 230.10] there's a reason there's okay I have a policy I don't read the back of books okay I do not watch
[230.10 → 240.66] trailers okay that's very fair that is my policy because I take spoiler alerts to like I have
[240.66 → 245.62] no idea you just baited everyone don't read the chat today well you can't spoil a movie that's
[245.62 → 249.78] and like there were no plot points I've talked to Brandon about it already I've talked to Brandon
[249.78 → 253.86] which is all I need to know Brandon says the trailer was flipping awesome I think there were
[253.86 → 259.06] minor plot points okay well either way i will ignore it because I know that the chat is
[259.06 → 263.46] going to be half full of people trolling anyway okay yeah yeah yeah so it's fine yeah it's fine
[263.46 → 268.74] they'll, you just won't believe it the twitch chat will literally cancel itself out yes in this case
[269.30 → 275.22] it does in most cases one type of troll working against the other type of troll effectively trolling
[275.22 → 282.02] each other um so anyway I have not watched the internet because like even Game of Thrones I have
[282.02 → 287.54] literally no idea what happens after the first book because I am determined to wait until either all
[287.54 → 293.38] the books are out or George RR martin dies at which point i will read all the books that are available
[293.38 → 297.62] and then I will watch the entire show and I will binge-watch it and that will be that's funny because
[297.62 → 301.14] it's exactly my plan that will be exactly how it's going to go down so I take this whole thing very
[301.14 → 309.46] seriously so I don't even I watched the first force awakens trailer I let myself have that I watched it
[309.46 → 316.02] okay I went yep those are axe wings those are lightsabres this movie cannot be bad oh it's
[316.02 → 322.58] George arcings no, no he's not there that's good um so I am going to uh so I'm going to wait I'm gonna
[322.58 → 328.10] wait, so people were asking for impressions my impressions are that I am cautiously optimistic
[328.10 → 333.94] that Abrams is not going to do anything to my tailpipe with the new Star Wars movie, and you know
[333.94 → 337.70] it's funny I was looking at talk that he will in just the right way yeah in just the right way and
[337.70 → 344.18] he'll look me in the eye um so I was looking at top grossing movies of all time, and you know what's
[344.18 → 352.50] funny is even corrected for today Star Wars is not that competitive like it's good it's good to be
[352.50 → 358.18] clear it's good um for today though yeah because like you correct for inflation so yeah, but that's
[358.18 → 363.86] not fair because population increases that's true who would be able to go to the movie also increases
[363.86 → 369.30] but if anything that's advantage modern movies so like gone yeah gone with the wind is still the
[369.30 → 375.46] number one grossing movie of all time corrected for inflation so uh here let's let's just bring it up
[375.46 → 380.42] it's top grossing movies of all time there's like a Wikipedia article which hopefully is somewhat
[380.42 → 386.50] accurate it's purple I was just looking at it um so yeah when you actually look at it avatar crushes
[386.50 → 392.82] everything by a long shot followed by titanic Jurassic World is number three what I had
[392.82 → 398.90] no idea Jurassic World performed that well uh beat avengers like really like I didn't know that
[398.90 → 405.78] Jurassic Park as a franchise had here I'll screen share with you did you see Jurassic World i
[405.78 → 410.02] haven't I want to i heard it wasn't that great I didn't think it was very good I thought the only
[410.02 → 413.70] good thing about it was the one dude that I can't remember the name of right now I'm terrible with
[413.70 → 418.26] actor names yeah we know if we ever make a show about movies don't write me out yeah you're not
[418.26 → 423.62] invited yeah yeah um but yeah so they have to have fairly good comments but I wouldn't know who anyone
[423.62 → 428.02] is and that would be kind of weird but like looking at this i kind of go you know you compare
[428.02 → 434.02] marvel right like Marvel Comics and the reach that something like that has compared to the reach of
[434.02 → 442.18] the Star Wars universe and I would have expected even the crappy Star Wars movies to perform relatively
[442.18 → 447.78] better than that compared to like all the avengers and all these Iron Man three are all these marvel
[447.78 → 453.14] movies like this is the top Star Wars movie I'm surprised Pirates of the Caribbean stranger
[453.14 → 459.94] tides did more than like Toy Story 3 Iron Man here let's look at the correct one so here's the corrected
[459.94 → 469.06] one so Star Wars itself the first movie actually compares very favourably but the other movies
[469.06 → 476.10] actually were nothing special and phantom menace is probably the most telling one so Star Wars fans
[476.10 → 482.90] are fans of Star Wars kind of regardless of whether they go see the movie or are even a fan of the movie
[482.90 → 488.82] I guess was my realization like Star Wars is so much more than the movie so I'm not even sure if this movie
[488.82 → 496.74] being amazing or being a total flop will actually impact anything about the Star Wars universe and its success
[496.74 → 503.78] as a franchise because you could argue Star Wars is the most recognizable brand that came from a movie
[503.78 → 513.54] ever that came from a movie yes didn't the books originate no, no no star wars the new hope
[513.54 → 522.98] was the first Star Wars thing okay um and yet they actually you know compared to especially in
[522.98 → 530.10] recent times like in the generation that you know I grew up in haven't really performed that
[530.10 → 533.54] well at the box office I mean I'm not saying a billion dollars is anything to sniff at I'm just
[533.54 → 539.06] saying that for what an international phenomenon Star Wars is I just would have expected it to
[539.78 → 544.18] to outperform Pirates of the Caribbean you know there's a fair amount of people saying like random
[544.18 → 550.10] things in chat like Harry Potter I saw a couple of times more than one person that's from a book for
[550.10 → 558.74] sure yes yeah I mean I like frozen did 1.279 billion and I'm kind of looking at this going really
[558.74 → 565.06] like I mean yeah it was a good movie I saw it but like a lot of people saw it I know a lot of people
[565.06 → 572.10] saw frozen i I get it appealed to all ages let it go and all that noise but i just if you compare
[572.74 → 581.62] the fleetingness of what frozen's impact will be on popular culture like yes it will, it's
[581.62 → 588.42] heavily it's highly impactful now and if they do a sequel then it will get some more momentum
[589.06 → 594.90] but you compare that to what Star Wars has done over the last what would it 77 I wonder what global
[594.90 → 597.46] warming's effect 40 years frozen franchise
[601.38 → 607.54] yeah I think that's been done with ice age so you know no we're we're like the planet heating up
[607.54 → 614.02] effects no I mean like it'll be kind of like not really a thing at one point it'll be like because
[614.02 → 621.30] it's based in so what where's it based in queen Elsa is gonna combat the oh I don't know it's based in
[621.30 → 626.10] like an actual like the and the kings that visit and stuff are from like actual places oh I did not know
[626.10 → 631.38] that yeah it's I read something about it Scandinavia somewhere I think right yeah yeah yeah so like those
[631.38 → 638.58] places might not be frozen at some point no but I thought it's like her power that made it frozen
[638.58 → 645.70] or some crap oh so that it won't yeah okay, okay so you're bad at actors and movie plots well no because
[645.70 → 650.42] they're from a place that was like when she's a kid they're like pulling ice out of the lake okay
[650.42 → 657.86] tell me this Indiana Jones okay carries a whip or a crowbar a whip okay just making sure because I don't
[657.86 → 661.46] know you might have had him confused with Gordon freeman at the beginning of the movie they're
[661.46 → 666.18] cutting ice out of the lake to take back for like cooling stuff down like they're in a very cold
[666.18 → 671.94] area right, but that's because they don't have her power is also freezing things yeah okay all right
[672.74 → 679.54] oh no our polar bears will have nowhere to go people are like Luke just stop what I wasn't even wrong
[680.42 → 686.58] apparently it is Norway so it's very cold there oh that's good okay you should just stop we should both
[686.58 → 692.58] just stop that's it for the show thanks we're done thanks for tuning into movie chat Friday we will
[692.58 → 702.18] see you guys next time all right why don't we do an actual topic here um the US is planning to enforce
[702.18 → 710.10] mandatory drone registration with the transportation department by Christmas they are taking this ball
[710.10 → 720.02] and running with it this is wait well how this is a stupid article how does apple owing a bunch
[720.02 → 725.78] of money for patent violation have anything to do with drone registry way to go stuff.tv you don't even
[725.78 → 731.62] know what your article is about this is like a two-liner I'm going to go to nbcnews.com yeah and I'm
[731.62 → 736.34] going to link people to that yeah link people to that so let's go ahead and pull up what we got here so
[736.34 → 742.26] according to NBC news the U.S. federal government plans to require all flying drones to be registered
[742.26 → 749.06] with the U.S. department of transportation by Christmas and basically this will what's up oh
[749.06 → 757.62] is the NBC site not even loading oh no damn maybe usnews.com anyway so they're going to be working
[757.62 → 762.90] with the drone manufacturers to put a system in place that and with retailers presumably that
[762.90 → 769.54] at the time of purchase will require people to register that drone, so there's going to be a lot
[769.54 → 775.22] of issues obviously the system is not going to be perfect immediately and people are going to find
[775.22 → 781.46] a way around it and there 's's no clear uh system in place for what happens to all the drones
[781.46 → 785.86] that are out there today uh what happens to hobbyist drones say what if you build your own yeah if you
[785.86 → 791.30] build your own I mean maybe they would make you register the chassis, but you could build your own mode
[791.30 → 797.06] but then who cares maybe it would be the controller board or something like that like if you could
[797.06 → 803.94] get the can make like uh almost just set up name of a model or form ending uh I think you can get
[803.94 → 810.42] uh like Raspberry Pi or yeah yeah you can so it's its not really clear to me how they would
[810.42 → 815.86] regulate these custom drones, but the point is that um I have a feeling this is going to be
[815.86 → 821.78] kind of sort of like this is going to get a little bit controversial but I think it's I have a feeling
[821.78 → 825.94] it's going to be kind of sort of like gun laws but even easier to get around where like the gangsters
[825.94 → 829.62] aren't going to care like the people that are going to do something illegal with it aren't going to care
[829.62 → 832.82] and they're going to just go around it, and then it's just going to be annoying for the people that
[832.82 → 839.86] try to use it properly yeah so they're apparently trying to take public feedback um into account as the
[839.86 → 844.90] as the rules are formed uh, but there 's's a lot of there's a lot of questions will there be a
[844.90 → 851.54] registration fee uh should certain drones be exempt from registration what constitutes a drone you know
[851.54 → 858.26] are are we talking like this thing now I mean I think there are some guidelines with
[858.26 → 863.78] respect to the functionality of them but I mean it's not like in the next five years you wouldn't
[863.78 → 869.38] expect to be able to buy micro drones that can mostly pilot themselves that have first person view cameras
[869.94 → 874.26] as the electronics get smaller and cheaper so so so would I have to register this thing I mean if
[874.26 → 880.02] that got if you know like a parrot mini drone gets sucked into a jet turbine it's going to disintegrate
[880.02 → 889.94] it's not going to yeah um, and it obviously can't fly that high so this all comes on the heels of
[889.94 → 897.78] a huge number of obvious violations of the existing laws where people are flying them next to airports
[897.78 → 903.54] flying them next to forest fires uh flying them around in the city at night when you know if it
[903.54 → 907.94] fell out of the air for whatever reason let's face it flyaway drones are a thing where if it fell out of
[907.94 → 916.26] the air it could hit someone's dog or child or um you know yeah otherwise cause a problem yeah, yeah so
[916.26 → 921.78] the consumer electronics association predicts something to the tune of 700 000 drones will be sold this holiday
[921.78 → 927.70] season so that's a that's a lot of potential hazards uh flying around in the air i
[927.70 → 931.86] can understand why they're doing it I can understand why drone enthusiasts are mad but
[931.86 → 937.86] most of the reasonable drone enthusiasts that I've either talked to or seen posting online are directing
[937.86 → 942.26] their hate at the people who are just screwing around with them screwing around with them doing
[942.26 → 948.34] particularly stupid things because let's face it the laws in Canada are kind of dumb like you literally
[948.34 → 954.98] cannot fly a drone pretty much anywhere in a city because you can't be within I forget what
[954.98 → 962.50] it is I think it's like a hundred meters of an animal or person, and it's just like okay uh you can't
[962.50 → 967.46] be i I forget what the rules are with respect I think you're not allowed to be in a park you're not
[967.46 → 971.06] allowed to this you're not allowed to that like there's all this stuff you can't be within a certain
[971.06 → 975.54] amount of animals or people, but then you also can't go to a park so you just can't go to anywhere right
[975.54 → 981.86] so basically you it pretty much is like yeah you can't fly them um so I'm just like okay
[984.18 → 990.18] but no one was really enforcing that until people started doing really, really stupid stuff with them
[990.18 → 995.94] so that's that's basically that's basically where we're at on that uh this is kind of a big deal uh
[995.94 → 1003.46] our original article here is from overclock3d.net let's go ahead and pull that up but WD has been
[1003.46 → 1010.98] confirmed to be in the process of acquiring SanDisk for 19 billion dollars so for those of you who are
[1010.98 → 1018.18] not familiar with Western Digital they make hard drives uh for those of you not familiar with SanDisk
[1019.14 → 1025.86] they make flash products so you know SD cards compact flash cards oh SSDs as well uh basically what
[1025.86 → 1031.54] Western Digital is seeking to do here should be fairly obvious they are trying to gain actual
[1032.10 → 1039.46] manufacturing capacity for solid state products because they've dabbled before WD has had hybrid
[1039.46 → 1046.50] drives for example they had that um that black squared yeah product that actually had like a 128 gig SSD
[1046.50 → 1053.46] and a hard drive, and they were like in one, and it was like kind of bizarre product yeah um but unless you
[1053.46 → 1060.42] own manufacturing capabilities you're always going to be paying someone else to manufacture the flash
[1060.42 → 1067.62] chips for you so you're never going to be price competitive in a commodity market like storage
[1067.62 → 1073.30] so Western Digital basically went okay let's bite the bullet now's the time we're going to go ahead
[1073.30 → 1079.54] we're going to acquire someone with actual fab capacity, and they bought SanDisk for uh for 19 billion
[1080.18 → 1085.70] now it is contingent on Western Digital is getting something to the tune of I think three billion
[1086.26 → 1091.54] in funding for x percentage of their company from some capital firm something so there's
[1091.54 → 1096.58] actually two different proposed prices one if that deal goes through which will be sometime I think
[1096.58 → 1101.54] second half of 2016 okay and then there's this price and then there's another price if it doesn't go
[1101.54 → 1107.22] through which it is expected that SanDisk would reject if that were the case so WD is not putting
[1107.22 → 1111.94] themselves in a bind where they might not actually have the cash to do this when the time comes
[1112.66 → 1118.58] which is pretty smart, but it looks like if all goes according to plan WD will have the entire
[1118.58 → 1126.10] gamut covered pure SSD now it's official it's official that the deal which is contingent upon
[1126.98 → 1134.34] those conditions is in place okay yeah, so the like the actual shares and cash have not
[1134.34 → 1138.74] actually changed hands right um, so this will allow Western Digital to bring hard drives
[1139.38 → 1146.58] SSDs and hybrid products to market with bare cost on both of them the only thing that WD would
[1146.58 → 1154.58] then be missing is actual like not because they can manufacture the chips themselves so they
[1154.58 → 1161.06] wouldn't actually be developing Nan flash technology like someone like micron intel with their joint venture
[1161.06 → 1167.46] or uh like someone like Samsung is doing so there you go I mean this is fascinating
[1167.46 → 1173.06] um like one of the notes says in the doc this is combining two massive storage providers and like
[1173.06 → 1179.46] WD as everyone knows are legendary in terms of hard drives and then SanDisk is huge actually in terms of
[1179.46 → 1185.22] like camera storage too SD cards very well respected both are very well respected for their quality and
[1185.22 → 1191.78] the longevity of their products, so this is a pretty huge merger actually yep uh SanDisk has been working
[1191.78 → 1198.18] very closely with Toshiba another actual NAND technology company um and the only statement that
[1198.18 → 1205.14] I've seen about that so far is that that will continue so uh yeah what a fascinating
[1205.14 → 1211.38] what a situation for someone like a Seagate out there yeah kind of looking at this going okay well
[1212.26 → 1218.18] that leaves us uh not a whole because there are not a lot of companies that actually manufacture
[1218.74 → 1225.38] flash chips like very few companies own fabs and now WD does a lot of them are in
[1226.02 → 1234.26] partnerships and stuff already yep so best of luck to uh best of luck to Seagate and yeah
[1235.86 → 1241.14] I'll be interested to see how they tackle this uh here this is interesting YouTube red so why don't we
[1241.14 → 1248.58] why don't we jump right into this um the original article here is from decode YouTube will make you pay
[1248.58 → 1258.74] to see some of its new videos which is actually and like a lot of people's coverage of this topic
[1258.74 → 1266.66] actually a little misleading they are not going to be necessarily YouTube's videos I am aware that there
[1266.66 → 1271.38] are some creators we are not among them there are some creators out there that have been approached
[1271.38 → 1278.90] to do exclusive like YouTube originals content, but it's not a hundred percent clear to me that
[1278.90 → 1283.94] YouTube would own those videos, and it's also not a hundred percent clear what would happen to that
[1283.94 → 1290.82] content in the very long term it's possible that like our arrangement with vessel where the content is
[1290.82 → 1296.50] behind a paywall and then comes out onto the free platform later so it's not clear if it would be
[1296.50 → 1303.54] a similar arrangement or not but I do want to clear up some of the general misconceptions about YouTube
[1303.54 → 1309.94] red because much like our video where we announced that we were going to start launching our videos
[1309.94 → 1317.06] on vessel and in the first 30 seconds of that video I said we are not abandoning YouTube half of the comments
[1317.06 → 1322.34] under the video why are you why are you staying on YouTube why are you abandoning YouTube that was
[1322.34 → 1328.90] insane that was absolutely insane, and it feels like from even some fairly large creators I've seen some
[1328.90 → 1337.06] really ignorant statements about this like did you even bother to read the YouTube blog post just read
[1337.06 → 1345.78] the blog post this is very simple okay if you're not being commissioned to make YouTube originals
[1345.78 → 1354.10] content it's business as usual everything is normal everything is fine everybody calm down nothing is
[1354.10 → 1362.58] changing ad supported YouTube is not going anywhere and I doubt we'll ever go anywhere because ad supported
[1362.58 → 1369.06] is a legitimate model what YouTube's doing is they are adding a tier they're adding a premium service that
[1369.06 → 1377.94] exists on top of in addition to the ad supported free model and what you get in return for an I think
[1377.94 → 1386.26] it's a 9.99 subscription is you get YouTube music after one month free you get YouTube music which um
[1386.26 → 1390.74] and then you get YouTube gaming which YouTube gaming I'm actually not 100 sure what the benefit is of
[1390.74 → 1395.70] having a subscription, but you get YouTube music which means that you can um you can listen to music in
[1395.70 → 1401.38] the background you can uh you can download things uh so in okay so hold on I'll stay focused on red
[1401.38 → 1405.54] anyway so YouTube music's not launched we'll talk about that later so YouTube red allows you to
[1405.54 → 1410.34] save videos to watch offline it allows you to play back in the background while you do other things
[1410.34 → 1416.50] without interruptions both of which are very cool features, and they allow you to watch videos with no ads
[1416.50 → 1422.42] so what that means is your membership fee that you pay, and it's actually not a hundred percent clear
[1423.14 → 1429.14] how much the split is so it looks like they're saying their quote is the vast majority of
[1429.14 → 1434.10] revenue will go to creators, but it's also been mentioned that creators would be paid the standard
[1434.10 → 1440.66] 55 percent um and then and then the way that it works is the money from your YouTube red subscription
[1440.66 → 1446.58] will be split among the creators that you watch according to watch time which as we know is YouTube's
[1446.58 → 1453.14] primary metric that they're looking for in terms of gauging the popularity of a channel and the
[1453.14 → 1458.66] and one should release excellence of a video and all that kind of stuff like a 24-hour random video
[1459.46 → 1463.62] just so you can be like I want to support this channel mainly and just idle it when you're not there
[1464.26 → 1470.26] that's called gaming the system, and we don't participate in that our one and a half hour our one and a half
[1470.26 → 1479.38] hour podcast notwithstanding so playlists okay so there are a lot of questions here that
[1479.38 → 1485.38] do remain even though the actual premise of this is very simple no ads being able to download videos
[1485.38 → 1490.98] officially and watch them later and uh being able to have them continue to play back in the background
[1490.98 → 1496.10] all of those videos officially yep so you can download them watch them later yeah so through the app and you
[1496.10 → 1501.46] can choose just red content or of all YouTube content is red content that's another thing a
[1501.46 → 1506.18] lot of creators are like super upset that I meant like red originals' oh yeah no nothing to do with
[1506.18 → 1510.98] red originals all content, so a lot of creators are upset that they're being forced into this agreement
[1510.98 → 1516.18] I don't really see why they care why does it why does it matter there's nothing our audience at super
[1516.18 → 1520.82] doesn't matter because they could just download the videos anyway yeah it changes probably know how to do
[1520.82 → 1528.26] that yeah really it changes nothing all it means is that instead of an AdSense revenue that you get
[1528.26 → 1535.86] for that view you're getting a red revenue split share and in theory based on yeah in
[1535.86 → 1541.54] theory it would be higher unless people are very, very heavy consumers for their ten dollars a month which
[1541.54 → 1547.54] they're not like I've run the numbers a view is not worth a lot of money like a single view so and
[1547.54 → 1555.06] another thing too is some creators are are are upset okay so first why YouTube is forcing
[1555.06 → 1563.06] all creators into this is because that's the whole service is YouTube without ads so yeah you're gonna
[1563.06 → 1567.54] need as a creator you're going to need to sign up, and it's all beneficial to you because people can either
[1567.54 → 1573.78] choose to pay, or they cannot, and then we've got creators that are kind of uh worried about well hold
[1573.78 → 1581.06] on a second that means that I'm not getting my ad revenue for that so then but hold on what if I'm
[1581.06 → 1586.34] oh hold on what if I'm in an area where YouTube red hasn't launched we're a perfect example YouTube red
[1586.34 → 1592.58] is launching in the U.S. exclusively for now so what if someone's a YouTube red subscriber, and they watch
[1592.58 → 1601.06] our video, but we're not a YouTube red creator we're not getting a payout or are we, so this is all
[1601.06 → 1608.34] not very clear but what I will say to the creators out there and to the viewers out there is I wouldn't
[1608.34 → 1614.90] stress about it, I really don't think this is a big deal I was looking at it last night and um I was
[1614.90 → 1621.06] looking at it last night and only about a third of our views in the last month on YouTube were monetized
[1622.02 → 1626.34] all of our videos have monetization enabled so whenever you click on our videos and there's no ad
[1626.34 → 1633.14] that means that view was not monetized, or you have ad block um so what that means to me is that even if
[1633.78 → 1641.14] so 40 of our audience is in the U.S. so it's so even if a fraction of a fraction of our audience
[1641.14 → 1649.86] subscribes there's plenty of video views left over for people who are not having views
[1649.86 → 1655.22] monetized thankfully we have a lot of people that help us in other ways yes the Amazon affiliate codes
[1655.22 → 1662.34] like the shirts like the forum contributions but even without that my point remains business as
[1662.34 → 1670.10] usual on both the creator side and on the viewer side you shouldn't care with the one exception being
[1670.10 → 1677.62] the YouTube original content, but the cold hard truth there is that if YouTube is funding this content
[1677.62 → 1684.90] to be created, and it wouldn't have existed without it then if you want it that badly much like the
[1684.90 → 1689.14] PewDiePie game is a perfect example do you think you should get that for free because you watch him
[1689.14 → 1694.98] on YouTube or something like if it's something that wouldn't have existed otherwise then guess what
[1694.98 → 1700.18] you got to pay to play um a lot of people have asked us what we have planned for YouTube red so far
[1700.18 → 1706.02] nothing um my YouTube contacts have not talked to me about it at all it's not being rolled out in
[1706.02 → 1712.90] Canada so I can understand why they wouldn't have talked to me at all um we have committed many times to
[1712.90 → 1719.14] our viewers that our content will always be free it may be windowed release periods it may be this
[1719.14 → 1724.34] it may be that whatever, but you will always have access to all of our content for free so depending
[1724.34 → 1730.10] on the structure of the YouTube red payroll paywall we might do something with it but only if it would
[1730.10 → 1734.82] be a windowed release, and we could release it to everyone eventually and so, so yeah right now business
[1734.82 → 1742.50] as usual and if you don't like it you probably misunderstood what it was because it's nothing it makes no difference
[1743.06 → 1746.82] I plan to subscribe because I already subscribed to google play music for eight bucks a month so
[1746.82 → 1753.38] it's another two dollars a month to not see ads on videos so yep I'm going to do it but um does it still
[1753.38 → 1759.30] have the family thing uh I'm not sure I'm not sure but if it do, you can still be my family yeah
[1760.58 → 1764.34] um sorry for people a couple of people started mentioning I'm doing weird things with my jaw and
[1764.34 → 1770.74] stuff I'm currently deaf in my left ear, and it's actually very weird I've got being on the show that's why I'm
[1770.74 → 1775.22] also doing this looking behind his head so I can hear what this here sorry we should have switched
[1775.22 → 1780.34] sides today I've got a lot of people asking what this means for vessel nothing um our vessel contract
[1780.34 → 1785.22] is still very much in place, so our videos will be a week early on vessel and anything we were to do
[1785.22 → 1793.14] with YouTube red would be within the confines of our existing release schedule so if it was is you know
[1793.14 → 1798.34] YouTube came to us and said something like okay you know we're going to do windowed release for YouTube
[1798.34 → 1803.30] red content and I was kind of looking at it going okay so we'd have a one-week window on vessel
[1803.30 → 1810.10] another week window on red and I don't know I don't know if we're going to do a two-week two week
[1810.10 → 1817.38] release window here um so we would probably not participate at least until the landscape becomes
[1817.38 → 1822.74] clearer to us um in that case but right now as a creator everything's very
[1822.74 → 1829.86] uh up in the air clear as mud, but it also totally doesn't matter because you can completely ignore
[1829.86 → 1835.62] it and everything will be the same yes which is fine which is good if you don't want ads and you
[1835.62 → 1842.74] want YouTube music and stuff sure if not don't worry about it yeah I'm totally uh I'm totally going for
[1842.74 → 1850.02] it as soon as it's available I'm super stoked are we that deep into the show already 5 20. How is it 5 20.
[1850.02 → 1857.38] 5 20. Why don't we do this next thing real quick sure uh large esports max fit max fixing match fixing
[1857.38 → 1864.74] thank you uh revealed in Korea one coach and two players arrested so basically I'm going to get a
[1864.74 → 1870.74] link going fairly soon but if Linus could take over because I'm currently posting a link why is there an
[1870.74 → 1878.82] NCI ad on teamliquid.net that's awesome yeah I can buy uh oh this must be like a Google ad or something
[1878.82 → 1885.46] I was looking I was looking at uh server essentials r2 last night mine was TD isn't TD a
[1885.46 → 1891.62] Canadian bank yeah yeah it's localized Toronto dominion so prime star craft 2 head coach Gerard
[1891.62 → 1901.78] and programmers Yoda and whoa I bought this last night yeah I didn't know that I looked for a camera
[1901.78 → 1906.98] once on one website and like every website I went to that had Google Ads after that had this kind of no but
[1906.98 → 1914.50] I didn't know NCI was this clever I didn't know they targeted ads that like that back when I worked
[1914.50 → 1920.98] there they didn't have any of any we didn't log what people were viewing and then hit them with
[1920.98 → 1929.06] ads about it so this is anyway I wonder if Google has a tool or something that seems likely yeah um all
[1929.06 → 1937.22] right sorry go ahead I don't did I say programmers I meant pro gamers my bad um Yoda and bong
[1937.22 → 1941.22] there's two b's on bong I hope I'm saying bong correctly have been arrested in connection
[1941.22 → 1948.10] with match fixing in Korea sorry boom b boom anyway yeah sorry I'm not familiar with this
[1948.10 → 1954.90] particular gamer uh where was I again 12 individuals have been arrested in total including financial backers
[1954.90 → 1960.74] and a journalist who acted as a broker two of the financial backers were ex-gangsters who provided
[1960.74 → 1966.98] the funds uh for betting to occur on illegal websites five matches were found to have been fixed I think
[1966.98 → 1975.22] it was around like nine grand yeah us yeah Gerard will uh was charged with receiving equivalent of about
[1975.22 → 1982.18] about 9 000 USD um all these figures are apparently approximate and Yoda to intentionally lose a match
[1982.18 → 1990.58] in GSL season one yeah, yeah so uh so there you go so basically um they're going to jail
[1991.46 → 2003.70] yep, and they've been banned for life um uh from the uh Korean esports association and uh so and uh Vespa
[2003.70 → 2008.58] I don't know if we call it that but I don't care uh have said that even if the criminal suit even if the
[2008.58 → 2014.18] criminal charges don't end up uh putting these guys in jail or anything like that they're still
[2014.18 → 2019.94] going to be pursuing uh a civil case against them um they're yeah basically they're they're taking it
[2019.94 → 2026.98] very seriously, and so they should this kind of stuff is total crap and undermines all the efforts of
[2026.98 → 2034.02] everyone else so many people in esports elsewhere to make esports as legit as possible has been
[2034.02 → 2042.10] huge and crap like this continuing to happen is just hard and yes we know it happens in every sport
[2042.10 → 2047.70] I get it, but they're they're currently going through growing pains, and it makes it that much worse
[2048.42 → 2054.26] yep I'm going to turn down our saturation a little bit that's one complaining we're too saturated
[2054.82 → 2062.58] all right so what else we got this is just a quick one but uh here we go Akira pc dot watch
[2062.58 → 2068.90] dot impress dot co dot JP is our source for this one this is great um so pretty much we've got
[2069.54 → 2078.18] confirmation that there's an eight terabyte SATA SSD in the making right now with a 10 terabyte
[2078.18 → 2088.74] PCI Express SSD also in the making right now is amazing I know right oh my god pc hotline
[2088.74 → 2093.78] oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god we're probably the
[2093.78 → 2098.82] only visitor on this site right now look at how far it goes down when there's no content left
[2100.10 → 2101.38] it just keeps going
[2103.78 → 2107.94] there we go okay so here we go that's the site
[2107.94 → 2110.54] And it's over.
[2111.98 → 2113.06] And it's finally done.
[2113.06 → 2113.92] And a banner ad.
[2114.48 → 2118.54] I really hope these guys aren't paying too much for that banner ad placement.
[2120.16 → 2121.54] Because that is terrible.
[2121.70 → 2122.44] Oh, wrecked.
[2122.52 → 2124.98] So basically, there's not too much to say about this,
[2125.00 → 2129.52] other than that, as expected, SSD capacity continues to rise.
[2129.86 → 2132.96] This is a Korean company called Nova Chips that's working on them.
[2132.96 → 2137.96] They're using a technology called Hyperlink NAND.
[2138.12 → 2143.54] So it's this daisy ring architecture that outpaces the parallel bus architecture
[2143.54 → 2146.58] used in industry standard NAND flash products, apparently.
[2148.64 → 2149.94] Point-to-point ring.
[2150.16 → 2153.98] You can pre-order it today on oleospec.com in Japan.
[2154.22 → 2157.54] But you would basically be a complete idiot if you were to do that.
[2157.54 → 2163.32] Because the pricing is about $10,400 for the 8TB SATA 3 SSD.
[2163.70 → 2168.62] And $15,600 for the 10TB PCI Express SSD.
[2168.94 → 2169.10] Wow.
[2169.40 → 2173.68] And they're not estimated to ship for another 3–4 months, depending on the SKU.
[2173.84 → 2174.20] Wow.
[2174.84 → 2176.92] So given the volatility of flash pricing,
[2177.08 → 2180.34] I would probably just wait until it's on a shelf.
[2180.72 → 2182.70] Maybe it'll be $8,000 by month.
[2182.72 → 2185.18] Honestly, that's the conclusion of so many things these days.
[2185.18 → 2187.40] Just wait.
[2188.20 → 2189.00] Just wait.
[2189.34 → 2193.02] Honestly, at one point in time, pre-ordering games wasn't that bad.
[2193.10 → 2193.40] Well, yeah.
[2193.44 → 2194.82] They only asked for, like, a retainer.
[2195.30 → 2195.58] Yeah.
[2195.74 → 2196.02] Yeah.
[2196.22 → 2199.12] You just put your $5 down, and you could actually cancel your pre-order.
[2199.26 → 2199.48] Yeah.
[2199.82 → 2201.30] Now it's like, nope, nope, nope.
[2201.32 → 2201.82] It's yours now.
[2201.98 → 2202.72] We gave you early access.
[2203.54 → 2203.92] It's yours.
[2204.60 → 2204.86] Nope.
[2205.72 → 2207.14] We'll specify the whole thing immediately.
[2207.40 → 2207.60] Yeah.
[2207.86 → 2210.76] And by the season pass, too, we'll give you, like, $5 off.
[2211.30 → 2211.66] Yeah.
[2211.82 → 2213.04] What the hell is that?
[2213.40 → 2214.50] Oh, my God.
[2215.24 → 2216.72] On that subject, here, we've got a—
[2216.72 → 2219.26] And, like, collector's editions not coming with season's passes?
[2219.50 → 2220.18] Yeah, I know, right?
[2220.44 → 2220.72] What?
[2221.46 → 2225.04] It's like, well, we did give you, like, a sick, you know, metal tin.
[2225.22 → 2227.28] Yeah, I was going to say, it came with a metal tin case.
[2227.40 → 2228.78] Collector's edition, limited edition.
[2228.86 → 2229.38] Oh, damn.
[2229.60 → 2230.18] You know what?
[2230.22 → 2231.60] Everything is technically limited edition.
[2232.52 → 2233.38] That's true.
[2234.10 → 2236.04] There is not an unlimited amount of anything.
[2237.12 → 2238.18] You're a limited edition.
[2238.18 → 2238.74] Oh.
[2238.74 → 2239.18] Oh.
[2240.62 → 2246.18] So, on that subject, it's unusual for a hardware maker to get involved in this kind of nonsense,
[2246.18 → 2256.30] but Sapphire, maker of graphics cards, put an opinion piece on their blog about pre-ordering.
[2256.30 → 2263.30] And you can obviously tell, based on the Assassin's Creed Unity screenshot that they got going on at the top of the blog post here,
[2263.42 → 2266.28] that they're not in favour of pre-ordering.
[2266.88 → 2270.40] But, yeah, basically, they're just like, yeah, blah, blah, blah, paid a test.
[2270.46 → 2271.58] It hurts the whole industry.
[2271.58 → 2274.80] Today, you have to put all this money on the table.
[2277.52 → 2280.34] That's really, I had no idea this was even in the doc.
[2280.48 → 2282.62] 50 DLCs of pre-ordering gray.
[2282.80 → 2284.88] That's kind of a cute subheader there.
[2285.30 → 2285.54] Yeah.
[2285.72 → 2290.84] But, yeah, there is, so, basically, the question at the end is this.
[2291.28 → 2295.58] So, there's nothing about the current prepay model that helps or is good for PC gamers,
[2295.64 → 2296.98] or I would say gamers at all.
[2297.36 → 2298.18] How do we fix this?
[2298.22 → 2298.78] It's easy.
[2298.96 → 2299.80] Stop pre-ordering.
[2299.80 → 2303.76] The group pre-order thing is so crap.
[2304.74 → 2305.92] God, I hate that.
[2306.04 → 2307.14] Tomb Raider did it, too.
[2307.70 → 2310.64] And they're just like, oh, the more people that pre-ordered, convince your friends.
[2310.74 → 2311.70] No, shut up.
[2311.82 → 2313.00] Don't convince your friends.
[2314.48 → 2314.96] God.
[2315.64 → 2316.02] Don't be a terrible person.
[2316.02 → 2317.76] It's like drug sales tactics.
[2317.86 → 2324.08] Well, it's like when the stupid elementary school is like, yeah, go to everyone's door in your neighbourhood
[2324.08 → 2325.76] and make them buy random crap.
[2326.20 → 2329.08] Those assemblies, which should be straight up illegal.
[2329.80 → 2331.22] God, those are bullshit.
[2331.54 → 2333.76] I cannot believe at any level.
[2333.94 → 2336.32] Sorry, this has always pissed me off, even when I was a little kid.
[2336.54 → 2340.96] I can't believe it's legal on any level to take everyone out of class, put them in an assembly,
[2341.16 → 2345.02] and give them a sales pitch that they have to push towards their parents so they can win a stupid toy.
[2345.02 → 2347.54] What the hell?
[2349.70 → 2351.80] How is this okay?
[2351.98 → 2352.24] Okay.
[2352.24 → 2361.34] Now, in certain cases, it was used as a legitimate fundraiser for legitimate things that you legitimate needed.
[2361.34 → 2371.54] Also, also, I won the five-pound Hershey bar at my school one year.
[2371.76 → 2372.62] So get wrecked.
[2372.72 → 2373.70] You're probably just jelly.
[2374.16 → 2375.58] I literally never did it.
[2375.76 → 2377.06] You're literally just jelly.
[2377.32 → 2381.02] And my parents, I don't even know if they would have stopped me or not, but I was like, this is dumb.
[2381.08 → 2382.48] Your parents are literally jellied.
[2382.48 → 2383.86] I got a real job.
[2384.24 → 2386.34] And I could have just bought the five-pound chocolate.
[2386.34 → 2387.78] You know how much chocolate I had?
[2388.48 → 2389.38] Get wrecked.
[2389.50 → 2390.86] I could have just bought it.
[2391.68 → 2393.60] My dad made me share it with my class.
[2394.10 → 2395.58] I was so mad.
[2396.24 → 2400.24] Like, beyond all mad.
[2400.24 → 2407.88] Like, I had to help cut it up into chunks to give to all my classmates.
[2408.28 → 2410.08] I was like, I would rather just not eat it.
[2410.34 → 2413.52] I would rather mount it to the wall forever.
[2415.32 → 2417.04] That totally sounds like YouTube.
[2418.66 → 2419.90] No, I won this.
[2421.32 → 2422.64] Let me see if I can find the one.
[2422.72 → 2422.98] Yeah, here.
[2423.22 → 2424.56] I've got some pictures online.
[2424.86 → 2427.70] So this is the one that I won.
[2428.28 → 2428.50] Yeah.
[2428.50 → 2429.28] It was one of those.
[2429.46 → 2429.70] Yeah.
[2429.70 → 2430.30] Yep.
[2430.54 → 2431.40] Five-pound Hershey bar.
[2431.74 → 2433.66] Apparently, they're more common than I had thought.
[2434.02 → 2434.92] We've got lots of people.
[2435.50 → 2436.58] Apparently, there's a whole thing.
[2436.60 → 2437.50] Oh, there's a whole thing of them.
[2437.66 → 2437.90] Yep.
[2438.32 → 2438.80] There you go.
[2439.26 → 2440.42] Hershey five-pound chocolate bar.
[2440.50 → 2441.24] Everyone's excited.
[2441.64 → 2443.54] I would have been excited, too, if I didn't have to share it.
[2447.56 → 2448.72] What were we talking about?
[2448.78 → 2449.46] Poor Linus.
[2449.80 → 2451.40] We're talking about pre-ordering games.
[2451.64 → 2452.02] Right, right.
[2452.02 → 2452.74] We ended up there.
[2453.90 → 2457.26] Speaking of pre-ordering, the HTC A9.
[2457.26 → 2458.10] Oh, yeah.
[2458.10 → 2460.70] Okay, what's their point?
[2460.86 → 2461.60] I don't get it.
[2461.62 → 2463.50] Oh, this is so mean.
[2463.72 → 2466.46] The Verge's headline, how to copy.
[2467.52 → 2468.50] Dun, dun, dun.
[2469.02 → 2469.92] But they, okay.
[2469.92 → 2474.70] See how they cleverly capitalized the T, which normally wouldn't be capitalized?
[2475.20 → 2476.84] Ah, ah, because of that campaign.
[2476.86 → 2477.34] I got it.
[2477.34 → 2477.80] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2477.80 → 2482.62] So, the iPhone clone could be the one I'm waiting for.
[2483.28 → 2486.76] So, basically, it's kind of a mid-tier spec phone.
[2486.94 → 2492.36] It's got a Snapdragon 617, which is super, not that exceptional.
[2492.36 → 2497.20] It's got a 1080p front-facing camera, which is kind of nice.
[2497.48 → 2499.94] I do support the better selfie camera thing.
[2501.58 → 2505.74] Because, yeah, for better or for worse, I do find myself taking them from time to time.
[2506.34 → 2506.78] My kids.
[2507.12 → 2507.90] That's my excuse.
[2508.26 → 2508.82] Okay, sorry.
[2509.08 → 2511.34] Not caring about selfies.
[2511.78 → 2513.46] But what is this?
[2513.72 → 2514.40] I don't understand.
[2514.82 → 2517.34] HTC President says, we're not copying Apple.
[2517.58 → 2518.98] It's Apple that copies us.
[2519.72 → 2520.02] What?
[2520.26 → 2520.80] Oh, okay.
[2520.94 → 2522.20] So, that's a separate article.
[2522.36 → 2523.36] We were going to discuss that later.
[2523.36 → 2523.50] Okay.
[2523.70 → 2525.32] But, no, we can tie that in here.
[2525.56 → 2527.36] So, I wanted to give a brief rundown of the phone.
[2527.48 → 2529.38] It has kind of middling specs.
[2530.26 → 2530.50] Middling.
[2530.62 → 2531.56] It's good enough.
[2531.82 → 2534.32] It comes in at a fairly reasonable price in the U.S.
[2534.32 → 2536.12] So, it's $399 off contract.
[2536.82 → 2540.96] It's not clear to me if this will be a carrier phone or not.
[2541.64 → 2542.92] DA-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[2542.92 → 2543.54] Not sure.
[2543.68 → 2544.92] The Verge article doesn't cover it.
[2545.50 → 2547.00] But, basically, yeah.
[2547.00 → 2549.72] It's got, supposedly, a really great headphone jack.
[2549.90 → 2550.82] So, like a better DAC.
[2550.88 → 2552.82] That's actually something a lot of guys are talking about.
[2553.26 → 2560.14] Rumours about the Galaxy S7 seem to indicate that Samsung is putting a lot of emphasis on better sound quality.
[2560.26 → 2561.62] They're putting a really great DAC in it.
[2562.54 → 2566.32] Personally, I haven't really had an issue with anything from the past couple of generations.
[2566.76 → 2568.16] And I suspect most people don't either.
[2568.42 → 2569.94] But, hey, whatever.
[2570.16 → 2570.86] Where are you going to improve things now?
[2570.86 → 2571.18] Yeah.
[2571.42 → 2571.64] Yeah.
[2571.68 → 2572.46] Where are you going to improve things?
[2572.56 → 2572.92] Well...
[2572.92 → 2573.58] The battery!
[2573.94 → 2574.12] Yeah.
[2574.46 → 2575.58] Improve the battery!
[2575.58 → 2577.44] Thank you.
[2577.64 → 2578.10] God.
[2578.48 → 2579.54] Now I don't have to say it.
[2580.44 → 2590.18] Well, apparently HTC thought they could improve their phone by basically copying the iPhone from pretty much every possible angle.
[2590.26 → 2591.90] So, this is, again, the Verge.
[2592.00 → 2593.46] Like, holy crap.
[2593.46 → 2600.18] The only differences that I can see between this and an iPhone are that it says HTC on the back.
[2602.20 → 2605.32] Like, there are more buttons on this side instead of that side.
[2605.92 → 2610.24] And the camera bump is in the middle instead of there.
[2610.32 → 2611.50] I mean, even looking at the bottom.
[2611.72 → 2612.78] There are more pictures here.
[2613.12 → 2614.06] Even looking at the bottom.
[2614.46 → 2615.16] Oh, my God.
[2615.16 → 2615.60] Wow.
[2615.60 → 2615.66] Wow.
[2615.92 → 2616.22] Yep.
[2617.22 → 2617.50] Yep.
[2617.78 → 2620.06] That's a very similar thing that you're doing there.
[2620.42 → 2621.22] Pretty crazy, hey?
[2621.32 → 2621.66] Wow.
[2622.28 → 2623.78] That's closer than I even thought.
[2624.02 → 2635.70] And so, in light of the accusations that HTC has copied Apple's industrial design, HTC president has come out and said,
[2635.70 → 2637.28] We're not copying Apple.
[2637.42 → 2638.90] It's Apple that copies us.
[2639.38 → 2639.74] We can't.
[2639.80 → 2640.62] This is great.
[2641.04 → 2645.78] We came up with the idea of putting an antenna band on the phone like this.
[2645.90 → 2646.80] Apple copied that.
[2646.90 → 2648.52] No, I don't think that's a design choice.
[2648.62 → 2653.34] I think if Apple could avoid an antenna underwear line, they would probably do it.
[2656.50 → 2657.54] Oh, no.
[2658.76 → 2660.24] Poor HTC.
[2661.26 → 2663.24] Just so silly.
[2663.24 → 2670.46] With that said, so this phone doesn't seem to, oh, to be clear, the $399 pricing is pre-order only.
[2670.74 → 2674.66] So, it's going to be going up to, I think, $449, but don't quote me on that.
[2676.80 → 2678.78] Basically, I see where they're going with this.
[2678.84 → 2685.54] Because while this phone is not really capturing the hearts of enthusiasts, I was actually on the DA Developers podcast earlier this week,
[2685.74 → 2690.14] which I don't know if they've posted yet because I should probably, like, pimp that spot.
[2690.24 → 2691.48] It was actually a pretty good podcast.
[2691.64 → 2692.20] I enjoyed it.
[2693.24 → 2699.34] While it's not necessarily winning over, like, the tech heads, I can see this selling in a store.
[2699.70 → 2702.84] Like, if I was shopping in a store and I didn't have enough money for an iPhone,
[2703.26 → 2708.58] and this HTC, the one thing they have done well is the fit and finish of the phone.
[2708.80 → 2713.38] So, if they achieve that fit and finish, and they compromise some specs to have it feel perfect in the hand,
[2713.38 → 2715.54] I think they could sell a ton of units.
[2715.94 → 2717.34] I think there's potential there for that.
[2722.68 → 2729.32] Yeah, I mean, I'm really disappointed that it has a really, really, tiny battery.
[2729.32 → 2731.28] It's 21-something.
[2732.62 → 2734.42] It's about 2,100 William hours.
[2735.42 → 2738.92] So, HTC claims that the battery life with the phone is going to be very good,
[2738.92 → 2743.64] but my sort of counter to that would be, well, you're running Android Marshmallow.
[2743.78 → 2745.84] It'll be one of the first phones with Android Marshmallow.
[2746.18 → 2751.08] So, you're running Android Marshmallow, which is probably where your power savings is coming from.
[2751.56 → 2756.10] So, every other phone that actually also has a decent battery is also going to be running Marshmallow,
[2756.26 → 2757.20] assuming it gets the upgrade.
[2757.86 → 2760.22] So, this is a very apple to oranges comparison,
[2760.80 → 2764.16] or at least it would be if Android phones ever got updates.
[2764.74 → 2765.72] It's a whole other conversation.
[2765.86 → 2767.56] So, it's a 2150 William hour battery.
[2769.36 → 2770.98] I guess, I don't know, sponsor spots?
[2771.24 → 2771.48] Yes.
[2771.56 → 2771.70] Sure.
[2771.84 → 2774.36] So, sponsoring today's episode, we've got...
[2774.36 → 2776.52] Dollar Shave Club!
[2777.16 → 2778.36] Dollar Shave Club!
[2778.50 → 2779.62] Dollar Shave Club!
[2780.12 → 2781.32] Dollar Shave Club!
[2781.70 → 2782.78] Do they have a jingle?
[2783.02 → 2784.08] No, that wouldn't be it.
[2784.48 → 2784.72] No.
[2784.88 → 2785.20] No.
[2786.00 → 2786.48] No, it wouldn't.
[2786.48 → 2789.92] Anyway, so the point of Dollar Shave Club is that if you want to shave your face,
[2790.34 → 2793.68] or your legs, or your chest, or your arms, or your butt crack,
[2793.84 → 2795.30] whatever it is that you want to shave,
[2795.62 → 2797.50] Dollar Shave Club has high-quality razors,
[2797.58 → 2799.60] and they ship them straight to your door.
[2799.80 → 2803.48] So, if you're worried about going out in public with a hairy butt crack...
[2804.64 → 2805.60] That could be a thing.
[2806.60 → 2807.48] You're just going in.
[2807.50 → 2808.84] I mean, you think about, you know, what...
[2808.84 → 2809.42] Or a nude beach.
[2809.52 → 2810.62] What'd your mother tell you, right?
[2810.98 → 2812.12] Always wear clean underwear,
[2812.12 → 2814.30] because you never know when you're going to get hit by a bus.
[2815.44 → 2815.58] Right?
[2815.58 → 2816.68] Shave your butt crack.
[2816.84 → 2818.46] Don't go out without shaving your butt crack.
[2818.72 → 2819.42] That's the new sale.
[2819.50 → 2819.70] Anyway.
[2820.32 → 2821.60] Sorry, that's not the new sales pitch.
[2821.64 → 2824.10] So, basically, high-quality razors straight to your door.
[2824.10 → 2826.06] Although Dr. Carver's shave butter would probably help with that.
[2826.32 → 2827.44] For a few bucks a month...
[2827.44 → 2828.34] And one white chocolate.
[2828.60 → 2831.58] They've got lots of great bathroom supplies.
[2832.38 → 2834.90] Razors, Dr. Carver's shave butter that goes on clear,
[2834.98 → 2836.38] so you can see what you're doing.
[2836.86 → 2838.80] Might need a mirror for certain things to see what you're doing,
[2838.80 → 2839.96] but that's beside the point.
[2840.30 → 2841.10] Or under the point.
[2843.68 → 2844.12] Anyway.
[2847.64 → 2849.00] Where was I going with this?
[2849.08 → 2849.22] Right.
[2849.62 → 2852.72] One-wipe Charlies to clean the affected area before you get...
[2852.72 → 2856.22] No, actually, the one-wipe Charlies are supposed to be separate from the shaving products.
[2856.36 → 2857.00] They're just butt wipes.
[2857.38 → 2859.30] The point is, for a few dollars a month,
[2859.54 → 2861.70] visit dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus
[2861.70 → 2863.52] and join the club today.
[2863.70 → 2865.96] Also, I must mention that they are...
[2865.96 → 2869.04] The one-wipe Charlies are labelled as butt wipes for men,
[2869.04 → 2873.06] but all of these products have apparently been used by female members of our audience
[2873.06 → 2876.82] or girlfriends or friends of male members of our audience.
[2877.16 → 2877.26] Yep.
[2877.26 → 2878.04] So, I have to give that to you.
[2878.04 → 2880.28] So, they could be like one-wipe Charlies.
[2881.84 → 2882.24] Charlies.
[2882.48 → 2882.72] Yeah.
[2883.08 → 2884.08] That's another way.
[2884.08 → 2884.88] One-wipe Charlies.
[2886.42 → 2887.58] No, no, I didn't mean French.
[2887.64 → 2889.04] I meant like Charlies, the feminine...
[2889.78 → 2890.14] Oh, okay.
[2890.26 → 2891.04] Well, FreshBooks.com.
[2891.70 → 2895.50] FreshBooks.com is an easy cloud-based solution
[2895.50 → 2898.56] to keeping track of the accounting and little details
[2898.56 → 2901.26] like the hours that you've worked for your small business.
[2901.40 → 2904.20] It's particularly great if you're self-employed,
[2904.24 → 2909.50] like let's say you're a plumber or a small-time PC repairs technician.
[2910.28 → 2910.68] Ah?
[2910.98 → 2911.32] Ah?
[2911.62 → 2914.38] So, FreshBooks allows you to go ahead, log all your hours,
[2914.52 → 2915.20] create your invoice.
[2915.22 → 2915.68] Super helpful.
[2915.82 → 2917.42] Send your invoice to your customer.
[2917.70 → 2918.88] And you can tell if it's been read.
[2919.04 → 2920.72] See if they looked at it?
[2920.78 → 2920.98] Yeah.
[2920.98 → 2923.50] And go, yeah, I actually do know that you got that.
[2924.06 → 2926.80] And that's actually super important and really helpful.
[2926.96 → 2929.24] Yeah, you could go ahead and pay that anytime now
[2929.24 → 2930.68] because it's super convenient
[2930.68 → 2932.96] because you could pay by credit card through FreshBooks.
[2933.32 → 2933.52] Yeah.
[2933.82 → 2936.42] Basically, it just helps you keep track of all those little details
[2936.42 → 2938.48] in one place with you on the go
[2938.48 → 2940.86] so you don't have to get home at the end of the day
[2940.86 → 2945.00] and be fussing about with your complicated accounting software.
[2945.00 → 2946.94] And if you're not sure if FreshBooks is right for you,
[2947.18 → 2950.82] head to freshbooks.com slash when and get a free trial today.
[2950.82 → 2953.22] And don't forget to tell them that we sent you.
[2953.90 → 2957.86] And our last bot here is for the Logitech G633.
[2958.96 → 2960.14] Luke is going to put on the headset.
[2960.30 → 2964.42] I've actually had a lot of people asking me for a review of this headset
[2964.42 → 2965.52] along with the 933.
[2965.52 → 2968.00] So I was waiting for the 933.
[2969.32 → 2969.76] Wow.
[2970.08 → 2971.38] I can hear you less now.
[2971.54 → 2973.86] I was waiting for the 933 to arrive
[2973.86 → 2976.22] so that I could do them both at the same time
[2976.22 → 2980.14] because I really don't think I need two separate videos of these products.
[2980.32 → 2982.08] But the long and short of it is
[2982.08 → 2984.56] they've got 7.1 Dolby surround sound
[2984.56 → 2985.98] with the Logitech gaming software.
[2986.24 → 2989.08] They feature 40 millimetre Pro-G audio drivers
[2989.08 → 2991.02] and that's really not the important thing about them.
[2991.34 → 2993.80] It's hilarious how like headphone marketing
[2993.80 → 2996.22] comes down to all these like points
[2996.22 → 2997.86] that actually mean nothing
[2997.86 → 2999.96] because it's all about the tuning of the drivers
[2999.96 → 3002.08] as opposed to the actual size of them.
[3002.50 → 3005.48] So the Pro-G almost matters more.
[3005.58 → 3006.28] That's the key.
[3006.36 → 3006.62] Yeah.
[3006.82 → 3009.44] Whereas gamers are so used to being marketed to
[3009.44 → 3011.12] with like driver size.
[3011.30 → 3012.12] More cores.
[3012.52 → 3014.72] That you kind of have to get in line
[3014.72 → 3016.34] or you're going to have a hard time selling your headset.
[3016.46 → 3019.74] Really, I don't think Logitech should worry about that stuff.
[3020.56 → 3021.12] Megapixels.
[3021.34 → 3022.22] Yeah, megapixels.
[3022.32 → 3022.82] I know, right?
[3022.82 → 3024.88] Megapixels and megahertz.
[3025.00 → 3025.88] And colour contrast.
[3026.04 → 3027.28] So they're compatible with the PC
[3027.28 → 3029.30] as well as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
[3029.38 → 3031.08] They've got adjustable RGB lighting
[3031.08 → 3032.50] and custom tags
[3032.50 → 3034.80] and they feature a cardioid boom mic.
[3035.00 → 3036.44] The very best sort of boom mic
[3036.44 → 3037.88] because an omnidirectional boom mic
[3037.88 → 3039.44] would be super-duper dumb.
[3039.52 → 3041.34] Have you seen how the boom mic is super ninja?
[3042.44 → 3043.34] Yeah, actually.
[3043.64 → 3044.52] Yeah, they showed it to me at PAX.
[3044.58 → 3045.22] Do you want to show them though?
[3045.32 → 3045.94] It might be.
[3045.94 → 3047.68] It's available now on Amazon
[3047.68 → 3048.62] and you can pick them up
[3048.62 → 3050.28] at the link in the video description
[3050.28 → 3053.60] which I will also be posting in the Twitch chat.
[3054.08 → 3055.30] Which is now there.
[3055.30 → 3057.26] I need to go like over me
[3057.26 → 3058.24] so that you can see it
[3058.24 → 3059.24] because my shirt's black.
[3060.52 → 3061.74] So I put it over my throat
[3061.74 → 3062.94] so they can see it.
[3063.16 → 3064.80] Yeah, so the point of the mic positioning
[3064.80 → 3067.16] is just because it's actually hilarious to me.
[3067.16 → 3068.52] How many microphones?
[3068.80 → 3072.44] You literally cannot position optimally
[3072.44 → 3074.26] because most people think
[3074.26 → 3076.02] the best place for the mic
[3076.02 → 3077.54] is right in front of the mouth.
[3077.86 → 3078.70] That's terrible
[3078.70 → 3081.74] because you get that pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
[3081.82 → 3082.60] the plosives.
[3082.90 → 3084.96] You actually want it at the corner of your mouth
[3084.96 → 3086.74] so having the length be adjustable
[3086.74 → 3088.26] is as important
[3088.26 → 3089.80] as having the height be adjustable
[3089.80 → 3090.94] for a microphone.
[3092.86 → 3093.34] Plosives.
[3093.70 → 3094.22] Plosives.
[3094.22 → 3096.26] I love it when words kind of like
[3096.26 → 3097.74] are the thing that they're describing.
[3097.98 → 3098.28] Mm-hmm.
[3099.18 → 3100.18] Like cacophony.
[3106.84 → 3107.82] I noticed that
[3107.82 → 3109.20] you know how I'm deaf in this ear or whatever?
[3109.90 → 3110.18] It's
[3110.18 → 3112.76] I still hear bone conductivity stuff.
[3113.48 → 3114.34] It's when I was nodding
[3114.34 → 3115.26] my teeth rattled
[3115.26 → 3116.46] and it was like super loud
[3116.46 → 3117.78] so I just kind of kept doing it.
[3118.64 → 3119.00] Okay.
[3119.22 → 3120.26] In the shower this morning
[3120.26 → 3121.04] the
[3121.04 → 3122.00] the like
[3122.00 → 3123.30] water falling on my head
[3123.30 → 3124.58] sounded so cool.
[3124.86 → 3126.30] We need to have a segment of the show
[3126.30 → 3127.54] called Cool Story Luke.
[3130.18 → 3131.00] All right.
[3131.10 → 3132.98] So Tesla's autopilot
[3132.98 → 3135.10] got a speeding warning.
[3135.36 → 3135.72] To be clear
[3135.72 → 3136.74] it was a warning.
[3136.88 → 3137.12] Yeah.
[3137.34 → 3138.32] Not a ticket
[3138.32 → 3140.54] but it was basically doing what?
[3140.60 → 3141.62] 75 miles an hour
[3141.62 → 3142.34] in a 60 zone?
[3142.58 → 3142.96] And like
[3142.96 → 3143.36] okay
[3143.36 → 3144.46] there's some
[3144.46 → 3144.82] thing
[3144.82 → 3146.34] if I could get to the topic
[3146.34 → 3146.76] that was
[3146.76 → 3147.28] oh look
[3147.28 → 3147.92] there are some things
[3147.92 → 3148.78] that people have to realize
[3148.78 → 3149.74] I'm not at the topic yet
[3149.74 → 3150.02] but
[3150.02 → 3150.94] it's like
[3150.94 → 3152.04] you're still supposed to
[3152.04 → 3153.18] kind of drive the car.
[3153.72 → 3154.70] Like we talked about that
[3154.70 → 3156.22] last week.
[3157.02 → 3157.98] Like you're supposed to
[3157.98 → 3159.40] still keep your hands on the wheel.
[3159.76 → 3160.44] It's supposed to
[3160.44 → 3161.58] kind of try to figure out
[3161.58 → 3162.22] zones
[3162.22 → 3163.46] but it's not going to
[3163.46 → 3164.90] stop you from going too fast.
[3165.46 → 3165.88] Um
[3165.88 → 3166.40] so
[3166.40 → 3168.54] Yeah it can know
[3168.54 → 3169.26] the speed limit
[3169.26 → 3170.18] without necessarily
[3170.18 → 3171.36] enforcing it on you.
[3171.46 → 3171.70] Yeah
[3171.70 → 3172.22] and it
[3172.22 → 3173.00] yeah
[3173.00 → 3173.62] I don't know.
[3173.76 → 3174.12] So like
[3174.12 → 3175.58] and also
[3175.58 → 3176.34] this was
[3176.34 → 3177.12] this was
[3177.12 → 3178.00] the video in question
[3178.00 → 3178.96] shows it being used
[3178.96 → 3179.86] on city roads
[3179.86 → 3180.82] where the beta
[3180.82 → 3181.56] is actually only
[3181.56 → 3182.30] currently intended
[3182.30 → 3183.28] for highway use
[3183.28 → 3184.06] where
[3184.06 → 3185.08] 15 miles
[3185.08 → 3185.28] well
[3185.28 → 3186.38] 15 miles an hour over
[3186.38 → 3186.94] is still
[3186.94 → 3188.08] significant
[3188.08 → 3189.68] but not as big of a deal
[3189.68 → 3190.28] as it would be
[3190.28 → 3191.00] within the city.
[3191.18 → 3192.64] Like you're a lot more likely
[3192.64 → 3193.70] to get a ticket
[3193.70 → 3195.22] within city limits
[3195.22 → 3195.76] than you are
[3195.76 → 3196.42] on the freeway.
[3197.08 → 3197.48] Um
[3197.48 → 3198.30] Like
[3198.30 → 3199.16] it doesn't enforce
[3199.16 → 3200.12] a speed limit at all.
[3200.28 → 3201.14] It's able to detect
[3201.14 → 3201.68] the speed limit
[3201.68 → 3202.46] or it should
[3202.46 → 3203.46] be able to detect
[3203.46 → 3204.00] the speed limit
[3204.00 → 3204.90] but it doesn't enforce
[3204.90 → 3205.64] it in any way.
[3206.24 → 3206.52] Yeah so
[3206.52 → 3207.56] some folks are saying
[3207.56 → 3208.48] the driver is at fault
[3208.48 → 3209.10] and the autopilot
[3209.10 → 3209.80] did what it was
[3209.80 → 3210.68] intended to do.
[3211.08 → 3211.28] Um
[3211.28 → 3212.12] as soon as it detected
[3212.12 → 3213.02] a possible collision
[3213.02 → 3213.98] it issued a collision
[3213.98 → 3215.20] warning and disengaged
[3215.20 → 3216.62] and the driver was prompted
[3216.62 → 3217.36] to take control
[3217.36 → 3217.86] of the vehicle
[3217.86 → 3219.06] and this is why
[3219.06 → 3219.72] Musk
[3219.72 → 3221.12] went straight up
[3221.12 → 3221.42] said
[3221.42 → 3222.12] okay
[3222.12 → 3223.10] this is beta
[3223.10 → 3224.40] keep your hands
[3224.40 → 3224.96] on the wheel
[3224.96 → 3226.22] this is beta
[3226.22 → 3226.76] and people
[3226.76 → 3228.12] disregarded that
[3228.12 → 3228.84] immediately.
[3229.24 → 3229.26] Yeah.
[3229.26 → 3230.20] There are so many videos
[3230.20 → 3230.58] on YouTube
[3230.58 → 3231.02] of like
[3231.02 → 3231.62] oh look
[3231.62 → 3232.74] it's driving itself
[3232.74 → 3233.26] and I'm like
[3233.26 → 3234.54] don't do that
[3234.54 → 3235.60] not the point.
[3235.60 → 3236.36] You're gonna ruin
[3236.36 → 3237.40] self-driving cars
[3237.40 → 3238.30] for all of us.
[3238.30 → 3238.52] Yes.
[3238.98 → 3239.56] Please
[3239.56 → 3240.82] don't screw up
[3240.82 → 3241.34] right now.
[3241.52 → 3242.54] Yeah, thank you.
[3243.08 → 3244.20] We need you to just
[3244.20 → 3245.40] participate in the beta
[3245.40 → 3247.18] be a good beta tester
[3247.18 → 3248.04] and just go on
[3248.04 → 3248.44] with your life
[3248.44 → 3249.62] or don't
[3249.62 → 3250.68] also would be fine.
[3251.48 → 3251.72] Um
[3251.72 → 3252.46] speaking of
[3252.46 → 3253.38] going on with your life
[3253.38 → 3254.26] how could you go on
[3254.26 → 3254.92] with your life
[3254.92 → 3256.46] if you didn't have
[3256.46 → 3257.08] one of these
[3257.08 → 3258.08] amazing
[3258.08 → 3259.26] LTT
[3259.26 → 3260.64] ugly Christmas sweater
[3260.64 → 3261.22] design
[3261.22 → 3262.48] when show shirts.
[3262.74 → 3263.64] I haven't actually
[3263.64 → 3264.32] seen these.
[3264.66 → 3265.06] What?
[3265.22 → 3265.76] The green one
[3265.76 → 3266.42] is awesome.
[3266.52 → 3266.76] Yep.
[3266.90 → 3267.86] There's a red one.
[3268.44 → 3269.06] The green one
[3269.06 → 3269.74] is ballin'
[3270.08 → 3271.00] and we've got
[3271.00 → 3271.20] like
[3271.20 → 3271.52] I didn't know
[3271.52 → 3271.92] there's so many
[3271.92 → 3272.34] different colours.
[3272.54 → 3272.86] We've got like
[3272.86 → 3274.02] gray and stuff.
[3274.20 → 3274.80] I legitimately
[3274.80 → 3275.32] have not seen
[3275.32 → 3275.74] these before.
[3276.02 → 3276.24] Yep.
[3276.74 → 3277.48] I'm definitely
[3277.48 → 3278.14] getting the green one.
[3278.16 → 3279.22] There's still a couch.
[3280.00 → 3280.60] Yeah I know.
[3281.36 → 3281.76] Well
[3281.76 → 3283.14] all Ed did
[3283.14 → 3283.84] was like
[3283.84 → 3285.18] kind of
[3285.18 → 3285.96] modernize
[3285.96 → 3286.78] the existing
[3286.78 → 3288.12] bow fist design.
[3288.28 → 3288.52] Yeah.
[3288.80 → 3289.52] So both of our
[3289.52 → 3290.10] shirt graphics
[3290.10 → 3290.74] are replaced
[3290.74 → 3291.70] by Christmas trees.
[3291.90 → 3292.74] There's a Christmas tree
[3292.74 → 3293.50] in the background
[3293.50 → 3294.76] and there's like
[3294.76 → 3296.78] pixelated snow.
[3296.78 → 3297.56] Are we going to get
[3297.56 → 3298.42] the shirts
[3298.42 → 3299.80] that are on the shirt
[3299.80 → 3300.84] or are we gonna
[3300.84 → 3301.58] get the shirts?
[3301.80 → 3302.60] We're going to get
[3302.60 → 3303.44] these
[3303.44 → 3304.10] that we're looking
[3304.10 → 3304.72] at right now.
[3304.72 → 3304.96] Okay.
[3305.58 → 3305.86] Yeah.
[3306.56 → 3307.68] So these are over
[3307.68 → 3307.82] at
[3307.82 → 3308.80] teespring.com
[3308.80 → 3309.18] slash
[3309.18 → 3309.78] when Christmas.
[3309.96 → 3310.86] No I like the green.
[3310.86 → 3311.86] I think the green
[3311.86 → 3312.86] is the ugliest one.
[3313.72 → 3314.92] Green's pretty fantastic
[3314.92 → 3315.84] for a holiday sweater.
[3315.86 → 3316.80] So I'm pretty stoked.
[3317.00 → 3318.08] My holiday sweater
[3318.08 → 3319.06] last year was green
[3319.06 → 3319.94] and yours was red.
[3320.24 → 3320.70] So this year
[3320.70 → 3321.30] we can go
[3321.30 → 3322.22] you green and you read.
[3322.22 → 3323.10] I saw mine
[3323.10 → 3324.60] in my drawer today
[3324.60 → 3325.12] because I was
[3325.12 → 3325.60] pulling out
[3325.60 → 3327.20] my Keep On Digging hoodie
[3327.20 → 3328.54] which was awesome
[3328.54 → 3329.88] because Ubisoft
[3329.88 → 3331.08] did something stupid
[3331.08 → 3332.36] if I recall correctly.
[3333.58 → 3334.48] And I was talking
[3334.48 → 3335.38] about it on Net linked
[3335.38 → 3335.70] today.
[3335.90 → 3336.62] So I was wearing
[3336.62 → 3337.44] my Keep On Digging hoodie
[3337.44 → 3337.78] and I was like
[3337.78 → 3338.60] yeah baby!
[3338.60 → 3342.12] But yeah
[3342.12 → 3343.04] I am super excited
[3343.04 → 3343.90] about this design.
[3344.00 → 3344.50] It's going to be awesome.
[3344.58 → 3345.12] I don't think
[3345.12 → 3346.36] I don't think
[3346.36 → 3347.42] there even was
[3347.42 → 3348.38] a minimum goal
[3348.38 → 3349.28] for how many of these
[3349.28 → 3349.94] we were expecting
[3349.94 → 3350.38] to sell.
[3350.52 → 3351.10] Like I think this is
[3351.10 → 3352.14] very much just to like
[3352.14 → 3353.62] We kind of wanted some.
[3353.74 → 3354.94] Hey if you're into this
[3354.94 → 3355.46] then cool
[3355.46 → 3356.26] we're getting them.
[3356.36 → 3356.96] I want one.
[3357.10 → 3358.78] I want more than one.
[3358.88 → 3359.74] Yeah I'm definitely
[3359.74 → 3360.22] getting one
[3360.22 → 3360.60] because I think
[3360.60 → 3360.96] it's awesome.
[3361.26 → 3361.34] Yeah.
[3362.10 → 3363.48] Nick told me that
[3363.48 → 3364.82] there's some kind
[3364.82 → 3365.56] of complicated
[3365.56 → 3366.40] rollout of these
[3366.40 → 3367.08] like we're doing
[3367.08 → 3368.02] a campaign
[3368.02 → 3368.98] on Tee spring
[3368.98 → 3369.40] and then
[3369.40 → 3370.80] it's like a short one
[3370.80 → 3371.58] and then we're doing
[3371.58 → 3372.04] another one
[3372.04 → 3372.56] or something.
[3372.80 → 3373.34] Anyway I don't know.
[3373.54 → 3373.96] For now
[3373.96 → 3374.76] teespring.com
[3374.76 → 3375.34] slash when
[3375.34 → 3376.12] Christmas.
[3377.38 → 3378.24] Alright what else
[3378.24 → 3379.10] we got going on here?
[3379.58 → 3379.88] This is
[3379.88 → 3381.40] I love this kind
[3381.40 → 3381.92] of news
[3381.92 → 3383.34] where it's just like
[3383.34 → 3384.92] yeah
[3384.92 → 3386.16] Microsoft
[3386.16 → 3387.62] news.com
[3387.62 → 3389.54] Microsoft confirms
[3389.54 → 3390.50] the Surface Book
[3390.50 → 3391.76] is two times
[3391.76 → 3392.48] more powerful
[3392.48 → 3393.92] than a MacBook Pro.
[3393.92 → 3394.02] Oh.
[3395.12 → 3396.06] Okay then.
[3396.68 → 3397.94] So it's okay Nick
[3397.94 → 3398.42] I don't care.
[3399.44 → 3400.42] So basically
[3400.42 → 3402.92] they said something
[3402.92 → 3403.78] along the lines
[3403.78 → 3404.20] of that
[3404.20 → 3405.32] during the original
[3405.32 → 3406.44] unveiling of the
[3406.44 → 3407.16] Surface Book
[3407.16 → 3408.14] and then
[3408.14 → 3409.22] many articles
[3409.22 → 3409.66] out there
[3409.66 → 3410.44] were kind of going
[3410.44 → 3411.00] well
[3411.00 → 3412.88] hold on a second
[3412.88 → 3413.84] what the crap
[3413.84 → 3414.48] are you guys
[3414.48 → 3415.96] actually talking about?
[3416.02 → 3416.74] So Microsoft claimed
[3416.74 → 3417.40] this was the claim
[3417.40 → 3418.90] it is ounce for ounce
[3418.90 → 3419.96] pound for pound
[3419.96 → 3421.14] the fastest
[3421.14 → 3422.28] 13-inch laptop
[3422.28 → 3422.96] ever made
[3422.96 → 3424.28] anywhere on the planet.
[3424.86 → 3425.32] So when asked
[3425.32 → 3425.94] for clarification
[3425.94 → 3426.82] they gave the
[3426.82 → 3427.52] following statement
[3427.52 → 3428.84] our validated
[3428.84 → 3429.88] performance claims
[3429.88 → 3430.34] are for the
[3430.34 → 3431.50] Microsoft Surface Book
[3431.50 → 3432.62] with an Intel Core i7
[3432.62 → 3433.68] and 16 gigs of RAM
[3433.68 → 3434.50] and custom discrete
[3434.50 → 3435.64] Nvidia GeForce GPU
[3435.64 → 3436.62] against the
[3436.62 → 3437.76] MacBook Pro 13 inch
[3437.76 → 3438.84] with Retina display
[3438.84 → 3440.58] with an Intel Core i7
[3440.58 → 3442.08] with 16 gigs of RAM
[3442.08 → 3443.06] we used third party
[3443.06 → 3443.96] benchmarks to test
[3443.96 → 3444.76] the best available
[3444.76 → 3445.40] Surface Book
[3445.40 → 3446.36] against the best
[3446.36 → 3447.66] available MacBook Pro.
[3448.26 → 3448.86] But what they're not
[3448.86 → 3450.08] saying is
[3450.08 → 3450.96] what benchmarks?
[3450.96 → 3452.40] because you could run
[3452.40 → 3453.22] a game on it
[3453.22 → 3453.60] and be like
[3453.60 → 3454.74] yeah it's twice as fast
[3454.74 → 3456.46] so it's perfect
[3456.46 → 3457.76] which would have
[3457.76 → 3459.06] zero applicability
[3459.06 → 3459.88] to me as a
[3459.88 → 3460.94] Surface Book buyer
[3460.94 → 3462.24] like what I'm going to
[3462.24 → 3463.00] game on this thing
[3463.00 → 3463.56] for real?
[3464.20 → 3465.00] Just because you guys
[3465.00 → 3466.06] call something Xbox
[3466.06 → 3467.28] doesn't make it gaming
[3467.28 → 3470.06] like that console
[3470.06 → 3470.82] that they released
[3470.82 → 3471.58] well
[3471.58 → 3473.14] oh dang
[3473.14 → 3474.52] that's a little rough
[3474.52 → 3477.00] it's best for watching TV
[3477.00 → 3478.00] mainly sports
[3478.00 → 3479.84] I don't know
[3479.84 → 3481.06] like you said
[3481.06 → 3481.62] at the very beginning
[3481.62 → 3482.26] it's from Microsoft
[3482.26 → 3482.98] News.com
[3482.98 → 3484.00] so I don't really care
[3484.00 → 3484.42] at all
[3484.42 → 3485.18] I'll wait till
[3485.18 → 3486.06] someone else validates
[3486.06 → 3486.26] this
[3486.26 → 3486.80] like us
[3486.80 → 3487.46] are we getting one?
[3487.58 → 3487.80] well no
[3487.80 → 3488.84] yeah I bought one
[3488.84 → 3490.14] and Microsoft News
[3490.14 → 3490.58] is even
[3490.58 → 3491.32] this is not
[3491.32 → 3492.42] Microsoft's own site
[3492.42 → 3492.80] it's just
[3492.80 → 3493.12] Microsoft
[3493.12 → 3494.10] News.com
[3494.10 → 3495.28] but they're even
[3495.28 → 3495.78] saying like
[3495.78 → 3496.78] this is stupid
[3496.78 → 3498.22] you have told us
[3498.22 → 3498.74] nothing
[3498.74 → 3500.10] and because we
[3500.10 → 3500.76] already know
[3500.76 → 3501.42] like you can't
[3501.42 → 3502.38] you don't just get to
[3502.38 → 3504.56] defy the laws of physics
[3504.56 → 3506.10] our Core i7
[3506.10 → 3506.98] based on a
[3506.98 → 3508.56] slightly newer design
[3508.56 → 3509.28] and a slightly
[3509.28 → 3510.34] higher clock speed
[3510.34 → 3511.28] and actually very
[3511.28 → 3512.70] similar performance
[3512.70 → 3512.88] per clock
[3512.88 → 3513.38] well doesn't the Pro
[3513.38 → 3513.70] throttle?
[3513.92 → 3514.86] is twice as fast
[3514.86 → 3515.88] no the MacBook Pro
[3515.88 → 3516.34] doesn't throttle
[3516.34 → 3517.38] if it doesn't much
[3517.38 → 3518.16] what one throttle?
[3518.22 → 3519.36] the 2015 MacBook
[3519.36 → 3520.46] performs about
[3520.46 → 3521.70] half as well as it could
[3521.70 → 3522.96] in multithreaded workloads
[3522.96 → 3524.02] and that's another thing
[3524.02 → 3524.94] is because we don't
[3524.94 → 3525.62] know what benchmarks
[3525.62 → 3526.98] we know nothing
[3526.98 → 3528.26] about the workloads
[3528.26 → 3529.30] and it's basically
[3529.30 → 3529.86] meaningless
[3529.86 → 3531.94] speaking of things
[3531.94 → 3532.50] that are basically
[3532.50 → 3532.92] meaningless
[3532.92 → 3534.24] this is great
[3534.24 → 3535.22] Fallout 4
[3535.22 → 3537.82] the disc
[3537.82 → 3539.32] will not actually
[3539.32 → 3539.94] contain
[3539.94 → 3541.44] the entire game
[3541.44 → 3543.60] I hope
[3543.60 → 3546.02] that's so stupid
[3546.02 → 3546.82] it's apparently
[3546.82 → 3547.98] in some
[3547.98 → 3549.58] effort to stop
[3549.58 → 3550.20] piracy
[3550.20 → 3550.70] but
[3550.70 → 3551.92] as everyone
[3551.92 → 3552.86] ever should know
[3552.86 → 3553.64] that will mean
[3553.64 → 3554.66] absolutely
[3554.66 → 3555.64] nothing
[3555.64 → 3557.16] so
[3557.16 → 3558.40] yeah
[3558.40 → 3559.16] hopefully
[3559.16 → 3559.74] it comes with
[3559.74 → 3560.84] the vast
[3560.84 → 3561.38] majority
[3561.38 → 3561.98] of the game
[3561.98 → 3562.50] because a lot
[3562.50 → 3562.82] of people
[3562.82 → 3563.22] that I know
[3563.22 → 3563.76] these days
[3563.76 → 3564.90] including me
[3564.90 → 3565.78] at this point
[3565.78 → 3566.38] are still
[3566.38 → 3567.00] interested in
[3567.00 → 3567.52] physical games
[3567.52 → 3568.02] because of
[3568.02 → 3568.94] download cap
[3568.94 → 3569.78] yep
[3569.78 → 3571.58] it's a lot
[3571.58 → 3572.22] to download
[3572.22 → 3573.02] some modern games
[3573.02 → 3573.66] like there's quite a few
[3573.66 → 3574.08] modern games
[3574.08 → 3574.38] that are like
[3574.38 → 3575.30] 50 gigs
[3575.30 → 3576.24] if you have to update
[3576.24 → 3576.90] Star Citizen
[3576.90 → 3578.94] like oh god
[3578.94 → 3579.82] it's a lot
[3579.82 → 3580.32] data
[3580.32 → 3581.04] and every single
[3581.04 → 3581.60] time I do that
[3581.60 → 3582.40] like 50 gigs
[3582.40 → 3583.40] is 10%
[3583.40 → 3584.12] of my download
[3584.12 → 3584.44] cap
[3584.44 → 3585.16] for the month
[3585.16 → 3586.58] for the month
[3586.58 → 3587.12] yep
[3587.12 → 3587.72] so like
[3587.72 → 3588.36] if I download
[3588.36 → 3589.22] a game or two
[3589.22 → 3590.40] like oh dang
[3590.40 → 3590.88] there goes
[3590.88 → 3592.74] 20% of my download
[3592.74 → 3593.28] cap
[3593.28 → 3595.36] holy crap
[3595.36 → 3595.92] oops
[3595.92 → 3596.90] so buying physical
[3596.90 → 3597.60] games is still
[3597.60 → 3597.96] a thing
[3597.96 → 3598.58] for quite a few
[3598.58 → 3598.96] people
[3598.96 → 3600.60] and if you leave
[3600.60 → 3601.26] a huge chunk
[3601.26 → 3601.64] of your game
[3601.64 → 3601.82] off
[3601.82 → 3602.20] that can be
[3602.20 → 3602.52] a problem
[3602.52 → 3603.06] so hopefully
[3603.06 → 3603.94] it's just like
[3603.94 → 3604.94] a couple key files
[3604.94 → 3605.82] that are small
[3605.82 → 3606.60] yeah that's kind of
[3606.60 → 3607.02] what I'm hoping
[3607.02 → 3607.62] so the PC
[3607.62 → 3608.26] will require
[3608.26 → 3609.42] activation on Steam
[3609.42 → 3610.86] the console does not
[3610.86 → 3613.08] yeah I mean
[3613.08 → 3614.34] I get using Steam
[3614.34 → 3615.12] as DRM
[3615.12 → 3616.12] I especially
[3616.12 → 3617.30] get if
[3617.30 → 3618.10] the key that they
[3618.10 → 3619.22] provide is also
[3619.22 → 3619.88] a Steam key
[3619.88 → 3620.86] so that I at least
[3620.86 → 3621.54] have the option
[3621.54 → 3622.10] to download it
[3622.10 → 3623.06] because I mean
[3623.06 → 3623.64] not that I'm
[3623.64 → 3624.52] condoning this
[3624.52 → 3625.90] but that at least
[3625.90 → 3626.52] gives gamers
[3626.52 → 3627.10] the option
[3627.10 → 3627.86] to download it
[3627.86 → 3628.64] at work or something
[3628.64 → 3629.68] and take it home
[3629.68 → 3630.50] on a thumb drive
[3630.50 → 3632.42] which I'm sure
[3632.42 → 3632.94] you've probably
[3632.94 → 3633.44] done already
[3633.44 → 3633.82] I've done that
[3633.82 → 3634.26] tons of times
[3634.26 → 3635.10] we don't have
[3635.10 → 3635.92] a bandwidth cap here
[3635.92 → 3637.14] I've abused that
[3637.14 → 3638.20] to no end
[3638.20 → 3638.68] me too
[3638.68 → 3639.56] I've come to work
[3639.56 → 3640.24] with flash drives
[3640.24 → 3641.30] so many times
[3641.30 → 3641.94] yep
[3641.94 → 3643.80] that's like why
[3643.80 → 3644.62] Steam is installed
[3644.62 → 3645.42] on my work computer
[3645.42 → 3646.12] yeah I mean
[3646.12 → 3646.98] on Steam
[3646.98 → 3648.12] it particularly helps
[3648.12 → 3648.78] but on some
[3648.78 → 3649.40] of the other ones
[3649.40 → 3650.04] where it's much
[3650.04 → 3650.64] more difficult
[3650.64 → 3651.52] to download the game
[3651.52 → 3652.14] files and then
[3652.14 → 3652.44] just drag
[3652.44 → 3653.28] like I really
[3653.28 → 3654.66] I really don't
[3654.66 → 3655.20] understand
[3655.20 → 3656.60] if anyone from
[3656.60 → 3658.24] EA or Ubisoft
[3658.24 → 3659.66] is watching right now
[3659.66 → 3661.30] drag and drop
[3661.30 → 3662.36] install is like
[3662.36 → 3663.04] half the point
[3663.04 → 3663.74] of Steam for me
[3663.74 → 3665.28] being able to put
[3665.28 → 3666.34] all my game files
[3666.34 → 3667.18] on a NAS
[3667.18 → 3668.60] and then just
[3668.60 → 3669.26] drag and drop
[3669.26 → 3669.90] a game over
[3669.90 → 3670.62] to my SSD
[3670.62 → 3671.22] that I want to
[3671.22 → 3671.94] play at that moment
[3671.94 → 3672.78] versus downloading
[3672.78 → 3673.74] the stupid thing again
[3673.74 → 3675.18] has a huge value
[3675.18 → 3675.70] like
[3675.70 → 3677.36] and you would get rid
[3677.36 → 3678.18] of a lot of this
[3678.18 → 3679.46] whole data cap issue
[3679.46 → 3679.94] because
[3679.94 → 3680.58] you know
[3680.58 → 3681.16] you got your group
[3681.16 → 3681.80] of gamer friends
[3681.80 → 3682.22] or whatever
[3682.22 → 3683.34] you take turns
[3683.34 → 3684.70] being the sacrificial lamb
[3684.70 → 3686.14] to download the game
[3686.14 → 3687.00] and then just share it
[3687.00 → 3687.56] on a USB drive
[3687.56 → 3688.46] like there's still
[3688.46 → 3689.30] a place
[3689.30 → 3691.50] for physical data sharing
[3691.50 → 3692.38] every time I go
[3692.38 → 3693.12] to a LAN party
[3693.12 → 3695.02] you make sure
[3695.02 → 3696.08] someone shows up
[3696.08 → 3697.52] with the USB hard drive
[3697.52 → 3698.36] that has everything
[3698.36 → 3698.86] on it
[3698.86 → 3699.68] and you just
[3699.68 → 3700.36] pass it around
[3700.36 → 3701.60] I don't have a problem
[3701.60 → 3702.86] with online validation
[3702.86 → 3703.74] of the license
[3703.74 → 3704.92] that's fine
[3704.92 → 3705.74] but
[3705.74 → 3706.94] make it simple
[3706.94 → 3708.38] make the files easy
[3708.38 → 3709.50] and make the files easy
[3709.50 → 3710.78] yeah
[3710.78 → 3712.76] so here's a rumour
[3712.76 → 3713.42] and the
[3713.42 → 3717.22] original post here
[3717.22 → 3717.76] seems to be
[3717.76 → 3719.10] from Nintendo forums
[3719.10 → 3720.20] so I'm really
[3720.20 → 3720.86] not sure how
[3720.86 → 3721.94] this qualifies as news
[3721.94 → 3722.66] but it's in our doc
[3722.66 → 3723.22] for some reason
[3723.22 → 3723.82] so we might as well
[3723.82 → 3724.40] talk about it
[3724.40 → 3725.76] if for no reason
[3725.76 → 3726.68] other than to talk
[3726.68 → 3728.28] about how console rumours
[3728.28 → 3729.14] should all
[3729.14 → 3730.60] be completely
[3730.60 → 3731.72] ignored
[3731.72 → 3732.80] because most of them
[3732.80 → 3734.48] come from console fans
[3734.48 → 3735.32] and
[3735.32 → 3736.54] no offence
[3736.54 → 3738.30] but it seems like
[3738.30 → 3738.94] a lot of the
[3738.94 → 3740.88] really rabid console fans
[3740.88 → 3742.00] have no idea
[3742.00 → 3742.76] what the hell
[3742.76 → 3743.60] they're talking about
[3743.60 → 3744.56] when it comes to hardware
[3744.56 → 3745.76] the Xbox One
[3745.76 → 3746.58] can play 4K
[3746.58 → 3750.48] remember that
[3750.48 → 3752.22] it's like
[3752.22 → 3753.70] remember how big
[3753.70 → 3754.80] of a thing that was
[3754.80 → 3755.10] yeah
[3755.10 → 3756.30] it's like
[3756.30 → 3756.98] actually
[3756.98 → 3758.94] 720p
[3758.94 → 3759.50] on like
[3759.50 → 3760.14] everything
[3760.14 → 3760.80] and you know
[3760.80 → 3761.76] what the stupid thing
[3761.76 → 3762.36] is you can't even
[3762.36 → 3763.18] talk to these people
[3763.18 → 3763.86] because you're like
[3763.86 → 3764.42] okay
[3764.42 → 3766.22] let's take a step back
[3766.22 → 3766.86] for a minute here
[3766.86 → 3767.46] okay
[3767.46 → 3769.32] it has an HDMI
[3769.32 → 3770.98] 1.4 port
[3770.98 → 3772.18] okay
[3772.18 → 3773.18] so let's
[3773.18 → 3774.16] let's take a step back
[3774.16 → 3774.58] from that
[3774.58 → 3775.52] and let's look at it
[3775.52 → 3777.44] an HDMI 1.4 port
[3777.44 → 3778.10] no, no no
[3778.10 → 3778.72] the Xbox One
[3778.72 → 3779.28] is not magic
[3779.28 → 3779.74] no
[3779.74 → 3780.62] it is not magic
[3780.62 → 3780.98] okay
[3780.98 → 3782.00] so let's take a step back
[3782.00 → 3782.24] again
[3782.24 → 3782.92] not magic
[3782.92 → 3784.18] it's not magic
[3784.18 → 3784.68] okay
[3784.68 → 3785.58] HDMI 1.4
[3785.58 → 3787.10] that means
[3787.10 → 3788.42] 3840
[3788.42 → 3789.66] by 2160
[3789.66 → 3791.28] 30fps max
[3791.28 → 3792.32] okay
[3792.32 → 3793.34] so you're either
[3793.34 → 3794.22] playing at 30fps
[3794.22 → 3795.66] which is not cinematic
[3795.66 → 3796.88] no, no no
[3796.88 → 3797.82] no it's not cinematic
[3797.82 → 3798.44] or
[3798.44 → 3800.84] you're playing at 1080p
[3800.84 → 3802.36] and then they didn't
[3802.36 → 3802.90] even get that
[3802.90 → 3804.32] or you're actually
[3804.32 → 3804.90] going to end up
[3804.90 → 3805.62] playing at 720p
[3805.62 → 3806.38] they got cinematic
[3806.38 → 3807.50] 960p
[3807.50 → 3810.30] oh that's rough
[3810.30 → 3812.28] anyway so the rumour
[3812.28 → 3813.40] here at any rate
[3813.40 → 3814.48] is that
[3814.48 → 3815.34] and
[3815.34 → 3816.78] part of this makes
[3816.78 → 3817.76] a little bit of sense
[3817.76 → 3818.46] because
[3818.46 → 3820.00] relative to
[3820.00 → 3821.18] what console gamers
[3821.18 → 3821.94] are used to
[3821.94 → 3823.60] an updated Nintendo
[3823.60 → 3824.68] console might look
[3824.68 → 3825.24] like something
[3825.24 → 3826.22] super powerful
[3826.22 → 3827.72] right now
[3827.72 → 3828.88] because
[3828.88 → 3830.48] Nintendo has
[3830.48 → 3831.44] gone ahead
[3831.44 → 3832.76] with that rumoured strategy
[3832.76 → 3833.90] it looks like
[3833.90 → 3835.14] of more frequent
[3835.14 → 3836.52] release cycles
[3836.52 → 3837.36] I mean
[3837.36 → 3838.86] the other console guys
[3838.86 → 3840.80] are also rumoured
[3840.80 → 3841.42] to be working on
[3841.42 → 3841.86] replacements
[3841.86 → 3842.82] much sooner than
[3842.82 → 3844.06] the Xbox 360
[3844.06 → 3845.00] and the PlayStation 3
[3845.00 → 3845.60] got replaced
[3845.60 → 3845.90] but
[3845.90 → 3847.10] now we're
[3847.10 → 3847.94] seeing rumours
[3847.94 → 3848.66] that Nintendo
[3848.66 → 3849.52] is actually
[3849.52 → 3851.28] pushing forward
[3851.28 → 3852.40] with the Nintendo NO
[3852.40 → 3853.42] and we could be seeing it
[3853.42 → 3854.34] relatively soon
[3854.34 → 3855.04] so a faster
[3855.04 → 3855.96] refresh cycle
[3855.96 → 3857.64] midway through
[3857.64 → 3858.60] a longer cycle
[3858.60 → 3859.36] from your competitors
[3859.36 → 3860.24] could put you
[3860.24 → 3861.06] hardware wise
[3861.06 → 3861.96] in a much more
[3861.96 → 3862.84] competitive place
[3862.84 → 3863.98] without spending more
[3863.98 → 3864.48] this is something
[3864.48 → 3865.04] that we've talked
[3865.04 → 3865.82] about a lot
[3865.82 → 3868.24] regarding future
[3868.24 → 3868.68] proofing
[3868.68 → 3869.16] the concept
[3869.16 → 3870.18] of future proofing
[3870.18 → 3870.92] on the PC
[3870.92 → 3872.20] where actually
[3872.20 → 3873.10] compared to
[3873.10 → 3873.76] buying a single
[3873.76 → 3875.04] $5,000 computer
[3875.04 → 3876.36] you are much
[3876.36 → 3877.10] better off
[3877.10 → 3877.96] buying a modest
[3877.96 → 3879.30] $1,500 computer
[3879.30 → 3879.84] today
[3879.84 → 3880.48] modest
[3880.48 → 3881.00] waiting
[3881.00 → 3881.48] well
[3881.48 → 3883.08] relatively modest
[3883.08 → 3884.00] versus going
[3884.00 → 3884.70] completely like
[3884.70 → 3885.40] over the top
[3885.40 → 3886.22] and quad SLI
[3886.22 → 3886.72] this and that
[3886.72 → 3887.50] buying
[3887.50 → 3888.86] just sort of
[3888.86 → 3889.82] a bang for the buck
[3889.82 → 3890.70] computer now
[3890.70 → 3891.74] waiting two years
[3891.74 → 3892.32] while you're having
[3892.32 → 3893.28] a great gaming experience
[3893.28 → 3893.74] with that
[3893.74 → 3894.86] buying another one
[3894.86 → 3895.50] then you have like
[3895.50 → 3896.32] an extra computer
[3896.32 → 3897.38] waiting another couple
[3897.38 → 3898.28] years buying another one
[3898.28 → 3899.24] that strategy
[3899.24 → 3900.64] you spent $500 less
[3900.64 → 3901.48] and I guarantee you
[3901.48 → 3902.20] by the end of that
[3902.20 → 3902.92] period of time
[3902.92 → 3903.58] by the time
[3903.58 → 3904.70] games are coming out
[3904.70 → 3905.14] that are actually
[3905.14 → 3905.82] leveraging the better
[3905.82 → 3906.20] hardware
[3906.20 → 3907.42] that last computer
[3907.42 → 3907.86] you have
[3907.86 → 3908.62] is way better
[3908.62 → 3909.02] than the one
[3909.02 → 3909.40] that you would have
[3909.40 → 3910.02] bought for $5,000
[3910.02 → 3910.60] in the first place
[3910.60 → 3910.96] this is something
[3910.96 → 3911.48] we've talked about
[3911.48 → 3912.22] time and time again
[3912.22 → 3913.40] you only buy
[3913.40 → 3914.08] a super expensive
[3914.08 → 3914.58] computer
[3914.58 → 3915.38] if you just
[3915.38 → 3916.08] don't care
[3916.08 → 3917.48] if you're just
[3917.48 → 3917.82] like
[3917.82 → 3919.10] whatever
[3919.10 → 3920.54] don't care
[3920.54 → 3921.76] then that's fine
[3921.76 → 3922.22] that's cool
[3922.22 → 3922.82] go for it
[3922.82 → 3923.58] there's even better
[3923.58 → 3924.48] reasons for stuff
[3924.48 → 3925.28] like water cooling
[3925.28 → 3926.10] because a lot of times
[3926.10 → 3927.20] you can step those up
[3927.20 → 3928.02] very easily
[3928.02 → 3928.90] things like
[3928.90 → 3930.42] well monitors
[3930.42 → 3931.28] not so much anymore
[3931.28 → 3932.30] I used to say that
[3932.30 → 3933.52] but monitor technology
[3933.52 → 3935.34] is moving so fast
[3935.34 → 3935.86] right now
[3935.86 → 3936.96] speakers
[3936.96 → 3937.68] okay
[3937.68 → 3938.54] speakers
[3938.54 → 3939.50] a great pair
[3939.50 → 3940.06] of headphones
[3940.06 → 3941.76] actually I think
[3941.76 → 3943.14] I think peripherals
[3943.14 → 3943.84] are changing
[3943.84 → 3944.92] slowly enough now
[3944.92 → 3946.18] that you buy a great
[3946.18 → 3946.70] gaming mouse
[3946.70 → 3947.18] they had like a
[3947.18 → 3948.80] little crazy burst
[3948.80 → 3949.38] there was a burst
[3949.38 → 3950.10] and then they kind of stopped
[3950.10 → 3950.76] and then now
[3950.76 → 3951.52] it's kind of okay
[3951.52 → 3952.54] you either want cherry
[3952.54 → 3953.84] or Kaaba switches
[3953.84 → 3955.14] and kind of
[3955.14 → 3956.18] or razor switch
[3956.18 → 3957.08] Kaaba
[3957.08 → 3958.36] so
[3958.36 → 3959.12] so
[3959.12 → 3960.20] I would say yeah
[3960.20 → 3961.06] you buy peripherals
[3961.06 → 3962.18] things you interact
[3962.18 → 3962.96] with every day
[3962.96 → 3964.14] I do believe in spending
[3964.14 → 3965.24] a fair bit of money on
[3965.24 → 3966.18] but the actual
[3966.18 → 3967.14] like the CPU
[3967.14 → 3968.18] or the storage
[3968.18 → 3968.84] is a great one
[3968.84 → 3970.28] never over buy storage
[3970.28 → 3971.22] just get what you need
[3971.22 → 3972.22] and expand it as you go
[3972.22 → 3973.54] anyway
[3973.54 → 3975.22] so the rumour is
[3975.22 → 3975.80] they will have
[3975.80 → 3977.08] incredibly powerful hardware
[3977.08 → 3978.16] in the Nintendo NO
[3978.16 → 3979.48] and it was said that
[3979.48 → 3980.78] one software demo
[3980.78 → 3981.88] included with the kit
[3981.88 → 3983.98] crunches so many polygons
[3983.98 → 3984.70] that it's currently
[3984.70 → 3985.36] impossible
[3985.36 → 3986.94] to run at 60fps
[3986.94 → 3988.16] using a current generation
[3988.16 → 3988.90] Intel CPU
[3988.90 → 3990.86] and near top of the line
[3990.86 → 3991.70] graphics card
[3991.70 → 3992.88] which means
[3992.88 → 3994.12] nothing
[3994.12 → 3996.48] nothing
[3996.48 → 4000.50] can't emphasize that enough
[4000.50 → 4001.26] it means nothing
[4001.26 → 4003.10] so the point of this rumour
[4003.10 → 4004.16] topic is that
[4004.16 → 4005.14] we should ignore rumours
[4005.14 → 4008.70] and the next rumour
[4008.70 → 4009.14] yeah
[4009.14 → 4010.16] and the next rumour
[4010.16 → 4012.02] the Snapdragon 820
[4012.02 → 4012.76] rumoured to be
[4012.76 → 4014.16] 50% more powerful
[4014.16 → 4014.90] than the Samsung
[4014.90 → 4016.44] Enos 7420
[4016.44 → 4017.74] which actually makes
[4017.74 → 4018.54] a whole ton of sense
[4018.54 → 4018.90] because
[4018.90 → 4020.06] finally
[4020.06 → 4020.88] for the first time
[4020.88 → 4021.36] in a while
[4021.36 → 4022.20] we've got a
[4022.20 → 4023.20] manufacturing process
[4023.20 → 4023.72] shrink
[4023.72 → 4025.32] that will account
[4025.32 → 4026.22] for that 50%
[4026.22 → 4027.24] performance improvement
[4027.24 → 4028.20] pretty much
[4028.20 → 4028.94] right there
[4028.94 → 4030.66] and back to you Tom
[4030.66 → 4033.38] and our next rumour
[4033.38 → 4033.78] nope
[4033.78 → 4034.50] not a rumour
[4034.50 → 4035.32] no, no more rumours
[4035.32 → 4036.68] Microsoft is apparently
[4036.68 → 4037.96] is there more rumours
[4037.96 → 4039.06] okay let's see
[4039.06 → 4040.18] I hope we have more rumours
[4040.18 → 4040.78] uh
[4040.78 → 4041.78] uh
[4041.78 → 4044.78] uh
[4044.78 → 4047.64] it's rumoured that China
[4047.64 → 4049.10] is still hacking the US
[4049.10 → 4050.04] okay
[4050.04 → 4051.38] that's not too surprising
[4051.38 → 4052.16] it's not really rumoured
[4052.16 → 4053.20] that's more accused
[4053.20 → 4054.06] they're denying it
[4054.06 → 4054.90] um
[4054.90 → 4055.40] of course
[4055.40 → 4056.52] of course they are
[4056.52 → 4057.98] wow we've actually
[4057.98 → 4059.08] still got some great topics
[4059.08 → 4060.52] Samsung Galaxy S7
[4060.52 → 4061.24] specs leaked
[4061.24 → 4061.84] although I think
[4061.84 → 4062.96] we mentioned that slightly earlier
[4062.96 → 4063.96] okay, okay
[4063.96 → 4065.32] we got another rumour boys
[4065.32 → 4066.40] yeah we got another rumour
[4066.40 → 4066.62] oh
[4066.62 → 4068.30] this one's from WCCF
[4068.30 → 4069.84] WCCF tech
[4069.84 → 4071.78] so basically
[4071.78 → 4073.18] so they just got a picture
[4073.18 → 4074.18] I love it
[4074.18 → 4075.52] when the rumour articles
[4075.52 → 4076.50] just have a picture
[4076.50 → 4077.72] of the current product
[4077.72 → 4078.74] because it's like
[4078.74 → 4079.28] yes
[4079.28 → 4080.40] this rumour is so
[4080.40 → 4081.36] unsubstantiated
[4081.36 → 4082.18] that we couldn't even
[4082.18 → 4083.16] find a render
[4083.16 → 4084.08] that
[4084.08 → 4085.68] that a user created
[4085.68 → 4086.80] we actually
[4086.80 → 4087.68] just need to use
[4087.68 → 4088.12] the current phone
[4088.12 → 4088.76] um
[4088.76 → 4089.52] so the S7
[4089.52 → 4090.36] is apparently getting
[4090.36 → 4091.38] this is great
[4091.38 → 4092.06] I love it
[4092.06 → 4093.14] when a phone rumour
[4093.14 → 4094.58] it's rumoured
[4094.58 → 4095.16] it will feature
[4095.16 → 4096.08] better performance
[4096.08 → 4096.88] better multimedia
[4096.88 → 4097.52] capabilities
[4097.52 → 4099.14] and an improved camera
[4099.14 → 4102.62] not a battery
[4102.62 → 4103.68] Nvidia's new
[4103.68 → 4104.90] flagship graphics card
[4104.90 → 4106.06] rumoured to include
[4106.06 → 4108.06] better display interfaces
[4108.06 → 4109.54] faster processing
[4109.54 → 4110.90] and more RAM
[4110.90 → 4112.44] maybe even
[4112.44 → 4113.40] CUBA cores
[4113.40 → 4114.98] more CUBA cores
[4114.98 → 4116.36] you have got to
[4116.36 → 4117.08] be kidding me
[4117.08 → 4119.18] um
[4119.18 → 4119.86] so basically
[4119.86 → 4120.90] that's the rumour
[4120.90 → 4121.12] though
[4121.12 → 4122.36] 20 megapixel camera
[4122.36 → 4123.66] um
[4123.66 → 4125.20] uh
[4125.20 → 4126.68] Enos 8890
[4126.68 → 4127.36] or
[4127.36 → 4128.34] Snapdragon 820
[4128.34 → 4129.00] it's not clear
[4129.00 → 4129.54] if they're going
[4129.54 → 4130.08] to do one
[4130.08 → 4130.68] or the other
[4130.68 → 4131.44] or a split
[4131.44 → 4132.22] strategy
[4132.22 → 4132.84] they have done
[4132.84 → 4133.32] that before
[4133.32 → 4134.30] different processors
[4134.30 → 4135.20] in different markets
[4135.20 → 4136.28] um
[4136.28 → 4136.80] let's go back
[4136.80 → 4137.24] to something
[4137.24 → 4137.58] that's
[4137.58 → 4137.88] that's
[4137.88 → 4138.20] not
[4138.20 → 4138.86] quite as rumour
[4138.86 → 4139.60] as rumour mill
[4139.60 → 4139.76] yeah
[4139.76 → 4140.22] um
[4140.22 → 4140.58] whoa
[4140.58 → 4140.76] oh
[4140.76 → 4141.18] I wanted to
[4141.18 → 4141.50] talk about
[4141.50 → 4141.84] this
[4141.84 → 4142.38] what
[4142.38 → 4143.50] I've had their
[4143.50 → 4144.70] WCCF tech article
[4144.70 → 4145.16] actually
[4145.16 → 4146.02] but uh
[4146.02 → 4147.22] uh
[4147.22 → 4147.96] one of the
[4147.96 → 4149.18] recent um
[4149.18 → 4149.82] fast track
[4149.82 → 4150.30] builds
[4150.30 → 4151.72] of Windows 10
[4151.72 → 4152.84] has introduced
[4152.84 → 4154.08] a new prompt
[4154.08 → 4155.20] when you try to
[4155.20 → 4156.40] switch your default
[4156.40 → 4157.12] browser from
[4157.12 → 4157.42] Edge
[4157.42 → 4158.94] it was already
[4158.94 → 4160.02] super annoying
[4160.02 → 4161.16] where it actually
[4161.16 → 4161.70] is like
[4161.70 → 4163.14] can you confirm
[4163.14 → 4163.96] versus just
[4163.96 → 4164.58] immediately
[4164.58 → 4166.06] applying it
[4166.06 → 4166.64] once I click
[4166.64 → 4167.00] Chrome
[4167.00 → 4168.00] um
[4168.00 → 4168.78] so it already
[4168.78 → 4169.30] did that
[4169.30 → 4169.76] but apparently
[4169.76 → 4170.16] it's something
[4170.16 → 4170.66] along the lines
[4170.66 → 4171.06] of give
[4171.06 → 4171.50] Microsoft
[4171.50 → 4172.00] Edge
[4172.00 → 4172.62] a shot
[4172.62 → 4175.64] just like
[4175.64 → 4176.12] come on
[4176.12 → 4176.54] you guys
[4176.54 → 4176.94] Edge
[4176.94 → 4177.60] is a piece
[4177.60 → 4178.52] of trash
[4178.52 → 4179.12] it's almost
[4179.12 → 4179.58] as bad
[4179.58 → 4180.02] as Bing
[4180.02 → 4180.74] I'm sorry
[4180.74 → 4182.68] almost
[4182.68 → 4183.42] as bad

[4183.78 → 4184.36] and you know
[4184.36 → 4185.82] why did they
[4185.82 → 4186.36] change how
[4186.36 → 4187.02] you change
[4187.02 → 4188.14] program defaults
[4188.14 → 4188.60] why do I have
[4188.60 → 4188.96] to go into
[4188.96 → 4189.50] some stupid
[4189.50 → 4190.16] menu now
[4190.16 → 4190.96] yeah
[4190.96 → 4191.96] that's so dumb

[4192.92 → 4193.46] um

[4287.62 → 4287.78] in
[4287.78 → 4287.96] Bing
[4287.96 → 4288.08] it
[4288.08 → 4288.34] manages

[4288.54 → 4288.68] find
[4288.68 → 4288.94] something
[4288.94 → 4289.22] else
[4289.22 → 4292.08] kind of
[4292.08 → 4292.42] garbage
[4292.42 → 4292.64] that

[4450.00 → 4450.22] but
[4450.22 → 4450.34] if
[4450.34 → 4450.42] you
[4450.42 → 4450.66] drop
[4450.66 → 4450.78] it
[4450.78 → 4450.96] on

[4454.72 → 4455.06] there's
[4455.06 → 4455.24] a lot
[4455.24 → 4455.32] of
[4455.32 → 4455.52] places
[4455.52 → 4455.66] you
[4455.66 → 4455.78] can
[4455.78 → 4455.98] drop
[4455.98 → 4456.08] it
[4456.08 → 4456.20] where
[4456.20 → 4456.30] it
[4456.30 → 4456.42] would
[4456.42 → 4456.68] help
[4456.68 → 4457.26] so
[4457.26 → 4457.54] here's
[4457.54 → 4457.68] the
[4457.68 → 4458.00] proposed
[4458.00 → 4458.54] mechanism
[4458.54 → 4458.76] that

[4471.78 → 4472.22] waterproofed
[4472.22 → 4472.34] the

[4478.80 → 4479.18] business
[4479.18 → 4479.56] for them
[4479.56 → 4480.02] so

[4515.04 → 4515.78] with
[4515.78 → 4516.10] an

[4516.66 → 4516.92] so
[4516.92 → 4517.58] I
[4517.58 → 4518.02] would
[4518.02 → 4518.16] like
[4518.16 → 4518.32] to

[4521.16 → 4521.36] Droid
[4521.36 → 4521.66] Turbo
[4521.66 → 4522.00] if it
[4522.00 → 4522.18] still
[4522.18 → 4522.48] drains
[4522.48 → 4522.70] my

[4523.06 → 4524.48] but
[4524.48 → 4525.08] there
[4525.08 → 4525.18] you
[4525.18 → 4525.34] go
[4525.34 → 4525.62] apparently
[4525.62 → 4525.86] this
[4525.86 → 4526.00] is
[4526.00 → 4526.46] resolved
[4526.46 → 4526.76] I
[4526.76 → 4527.44] guess
[4527.44 → 4527.56] we
[4527.56 → 4527.76] didn't
[4527.76 → 4527.94] pull

[4536.22 → 4537.28] so
[4537.28 → 4537.70] kind of

[4538.04 → 4538.36] took the

[4601.76 → 4602.06] they
[4602.06 → 4602.66] remaster
[4602.66 → 4602.90] their

[4603.22 → 4603.54] good
[4603.54 → 4604.10] games
[4604.10 → 4604.60] than

[4606.56 → 4606.84] I
[4606.84 → 4607.12] also
[4607.12 → 4607.46] agree
[4607.46 → 4607.70] but
[4607.70 → 4607.88] maybe
[4607.88 → 4608.06] we're
[4608.06 → 4608.20] just
[4608.20 → 4608.40] getting
[4608.40 → 4608.70] old
[4608.70 → 4610.96] there's
[4610.96 → 4611.28] a sad
[4611.28 → 4611.56] thought
[4611.56 → 4611.88] I
[4611.88 → 4612.22] kind of
[4612.22 → 4612.40] doubt
[4612.40 → 4612.62] it
[4612.62 → 4612.90] to be
[4612.90 → 4613.18] completely
[4613.18 → 4613.60] honest
[4613.60 → 4614.08] yeah
[4614.08 → 4614.68] who
[4614.68 → 4615.04] cares

[4617.12 → 4617.34] fair
[4617.34 → 4617.64] enough
[4617.64 → 4618.30] remasters
[4618.30 → 4619.04] of
[4619.04 → 4620.42] old
[4620.42 → 4621.60] movies
[4621.60 → 4623.08] don't
[4623.08 → 4623.26] really
[4623.26 → 4623.46] work
[4623.46 → 4623.62] the
[4623.62 → 4623.80] same
[4623.80 → 4624.06] way
[4624.06 → 4626.76] I'm
[4626.76 → 4627.02] sorry
[4627.02 → 4627.54] I think
[4627.54 → 4627.66] you
[4627.66 → 4627.90] changed
[4627.90 → 4628.18] gears
[4628.18 → 4628.46] on me
[4628.46 → 4628.66] a little
[4628.66 → 4628.82] bit
[4628.82 → 4629.00] there
[4629.00 → 4629.20] was
[4629.20 → 4629.32] I

[4631.94 → 4632.34] old
[4632.34 → 4632.66] but
[4632.66 → 4632.80] it's
[4632.80 → 4632.90] not
[4632.90 → 4633.08] just
[4633.08 → 4633.24] because
[4633.24 → 4633.40] we're
[4633.40 → 4633.64] old
[4633.64 → 4634.56] oh

[4635.18 → 4635.40] just
[4635.40 → 4635.68] like
[4635.68 → 4635.92] I

[4750.04 → 4750.54] really a
[4750.54 → 4751.00] thing
[4751.00 → 4753.34] because reboots

[4757.02 → 4757.44] some people
[4757.44 → 4757.78] might hate
[4757.78 → 4758.18] on me for
[4758.18 → 4758.22] that
[4758.22 → 4759.02] certain reboots
[4759.02 → 4759.64] I think
[4759.64 → 4760.22] are okay
[4760.22 → 4761.02] like
[4761.02 → 4761.58] like
[4761.58 → 4762.62] I joked
[4762.62 → 4764.12] on Twitter
[4764.12 → 4764.98] about how
[4764.98 → 4765.54] like the only
[4765.54 → 4765.98] movie that
[4765.98 → 4766.58] matters is
[4766.58 → 4766.92] hackers
[4766.92 → 4767.32] and it
[4767.32 → 4767.62] should just
[4767.62 → 4768.28] be remastered
[4768.28 → 4768.72] rebooted
[4768.72 → 4769.54] and Hollywood
[4769.54 → 4769.94] should just
[4769.94 → 4770.16] quit
[4770.16 → 4770.94] it was an
[4770.94 → 4771.66] obvious joke
[4771.66 → 4772.34] some people
[4772.34 → 4772.76] thought I was
[4772.76 → 4773.08] serious
[4773.08 → 4773.64] which was
[4773.64 → 4773.98] weird
[4773.98 → 4774.92] um
[4774.92 → 4775.64] but
[4775.64 → 4777.06] like I don't
[4777.06 → 4777.52] want them to
[4777.52 → 4778.26] remake hackers
[4778.26 → 4779.10] right
[4779.10 → 4779.54] that would be
[4779.54 → 4780.24] the worst
[4780.24 → 4781.80] hackers doesn't
[4781.80 → 4782.40] make sense

[4783.34 → 4784.52] yeah
[4784.52 → 4784.86] it just makes
[4784.86 → 4785.38] sense when it
[4785.38 → 4785.86] was filmed
[4785.86 → 4786.28] right
[4786.28 → 4786.80] and it was
[4786.80 → 4787.40] great back
[4787.40 → 4787.68] then
[4787.68 → 4789.30] and like

[4794.40 → 4795.02] 2015

[4822.34 → 4822.90] ordering empty
[4822.90 → 4824.08] parcels to
[4824.08 → 4824.90] avoid detection
[4824.90 → 4825.78] and who are
[4825.78 → 4826.40] working with
[4826.40 → 4827.14] manufacturers
[4827.14 → 4828.32] to post
[4828.32 → 4829.76] fake five-star
[4829.76 → 4830.92] reviews on
[4830.92 → 4831.70] the website
[4831.70 → 4832.84] so the
[4832.84 → 4833.30] defendants
[4833.30 → 4833.78] named as
[4833.78 → 4834.46] john does
[4834.46 → 4834.84] and referred
[4834.84 → 4835.34] to only by
[4835.34 → 4835.96] their usernames
[4835.96 → 4836.66] offered to
[4836.66 → 4837.52] write fraudulent
[4837.52 → 4838.38] reviews for as
[4838.38 → 4839.38] little as
[4839.38 → 4840.48] five dollars
[4840.48 → 4841.40] and this is an
[4841.40 → 4842.30] Amazon statement
[4842.30 → 4842.94] uh
[4842.94 → 4843.56] takes the
[4843.56 → 4844.16] credibility of
[4844.16 → 4844.60] its customer
[4844.60 → 4845.16] reviews very
[4845.16 → 4845.62] seriously
[4845.62 → 4846.70] an unhealthy
[4846.70 → 4847.64] ecosystem has
[4847.64 → 4848.38] developed outside
[4848.38 → 4848.98] of Amazon
[4848.98 → 4850.34] to supply reviews
[4850.34 → 4851.48] in exchange
[4851.48 → 4852.74] for payment
[4852.74 → 4853.98] and I mean
[4853.98 → 4854.50] things like
[4854.50 → 4855.58] verified owner
[4855.58 → 4856.82] do help a lot
[4856.82 → 4857.42] i generally
[4857.42 → 4858.38] speaking ignore
[4858.38 → 4859.02] anything that's
[4859.02 → 4859.64] not a verified
[4859.64 → 4860.32] purchase on
[4860.32 → 4860.62] Amazon
[4860.62 → 4862.74] but that doesn't
[4862.74 → 4863.58] change that the
[4863.58 → 4864.26] like the overall
[4864.26 → 4865.12] star rating is
[4865.12 → 4865.94] affected by all
[4865.94 → 4866.26] of them
[4866.26 → 4867.34] one thing Amazon
[4867.34 → 4868.00] could do actually
[4868.00 → 4868.68] this is kind of a
[4868.68 → 4869.38] smart idea
[4869.38 → 4870.30] sometimes I have
[4870.30 → 4871.28] those if anyone
[4871.28 → 4871.90] from Amazon is
[4871.90 → 4872.86] watching maybe
[4872.86 → 4874.04] give us a way to
[4874.04 → 4875.60] filter um the
[4875.60 → 4876.50] verified purchases
[4876.50 → 4877.08] from the non
[4877.08 → 4877.84] verified purchases
[4877.84 → 4878.70] in the star rating
[4878.70 → 4879.18] that would be
[4879.18 → 4879.62] super cool
[4879.62 → 4884.44] um yeah so i
[4884.44 → 4884.90] don't know I guess
[4884.90 → 4885.28] that's all there
[4885.28 → 4885.90] is to really say
[4885.90 → 4886.80] about it other
[4886.80 → 4887.70] than that
[4887.70 → 4888.86] practice sucks and
[4888.86 → 4889.74] we hate it
[4889.74 → 4891.46] everyone chats
[4891.46 → 4892.24] freaking
[4892.24 → 4892.90] out about fallout
[4892.90 → 4894.38] four but the
[4894.38 → 4895.06] fallout four is
[4895.06 → 4895.76] not for like
[4895.76 → 4897.20] three weeks or
[4897.20 → 4897.94] something two and
[4897.94 → 4898.98] a half week so
[4898.98 → 4899.68] yeah you got a
[4899.68 → 4900.24] collector's edition
[4900.24 → 4901.70] right yes
[4901.70 → 4904.18] very narrowly
[4904.18 → 4905.88] yeah um there
[4905.88 → 4906.50] was there was
[4906.50 → 4907.76] wave one which
[4907.76 → 4908.72] like I was at
[4908.72 → 4910.20] work or somewhere
[4910.20 → 4911.04] I was doing
[4911.04 → 4911.66] something so i
[4911.66 → 4911.98] didn't have a
[4911.98 → 4912.56] chance to get it
[4912.56 → 4913.56] and then there
[4913.56 → 4914.58] was wave two which
[4914.58 → 4915.14] I didn't hear about
[4915.14 → 4915.86] until it was over
[4915.86 → 4917.08] because they like
[4917.08 → 4918.36] stores randomly got
[4918.36 → 4919.24] more stock like
[4919.24 → 4919.92] all over the place
[4919.92 → 4920.40] but there wasn't
[4920.40 → 4921.06] that much stock
[4921.06 → 4921.80] and I didn't hear
[4921.80 → 4922.72] about it so i
[4922.72 → 4923.80] didn't get the
[4923.80 → 4924.34] collector's edition
[4924.34 → 4926.62] thing and then a
[4926.62 → 4927.44] while later I was
[4927.44 → 4928.02] trying to see like
[4928.02 → 4928.68] oh I wonder how
[4928.68 → 4929.36] much they are on
[4929.36 → 4930.04] like eBay or
[4930.04 → 4930.80] something because
[4930.80 → 4931.16] if it's like
[4931.16 → 4932.02] slightly more than
[4932.02 → 4932.92] sure but I knew it
[4932.92 → 4933.56] would be ridiculous
[4933.56 → 4934.18] right and it
[4934.18 → 4935.22] was like 700
[4935.22 → 4936.10] dollars and I was
[4936.10 → 4937.42] like okay nope
[4937.42 → 4938.42] not doing that
[4938.42 → 4940.04] obviously so on
[4940.04 → 4940.68] twitter I'm like
[4940.68 → 4941.52] does anyone know
[4941.52 → 4942.30] of anywhere where
[4942.30 → 4943.20] it's not ridiculous
[4943.20 → 4943.94] and some dude's
[4943.94 → 4944.92] like oh I have a
[4944.92 → 4945.68] huge backlog and
[4945.68 → 4945.98] I'm just gonna
[4945.98 → 4946.82] cancel my pre-order
[4946.82 → 4947.36] so you can just
[4947.36 → 4948.26] take it I was
[4948.26 → 4950.94] like wow that's
[4950.94 → 4951.46] pretty nice so he
[4951.46 → 4952.14] messaged me on the
[4952.14 → 4952.98] forum and we
[4952.98 → 4953.74] worked out everything
[4953.74 → 4954.48] and it's going to be
[4954.48 → 4956.86] fine this is so
[4956.86 → 4958.44] funny I can't
[4958.44 → 4958.98] believe we didn't
[4958.98 → 4960.60] mention this uh

[4969.34 → 4970.58] similarity to another
[4970.58 → 4971.82] online video site
[4971.82 → 4973.00] that's also red
[4973.00 → 4974.34] and also has two
[4974.34 → 4974.88] in the name
[4974.88 → 4976.54] yeah I just can't
