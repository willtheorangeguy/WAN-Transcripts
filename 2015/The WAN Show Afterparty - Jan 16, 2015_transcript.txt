[0.00 --> 2.12]  Okay, so, yeah, let's do this.
[2.12 --> 2.56]  Welcome to the after part.
[2.60 --> 3.94]  Oh, I should change the...
[3.94 --> 5.46]  I always forget to do this.
[6.50 --> 7.50]  Um, dashboard.
[8.94 --> 9.50]  Dashboard!
[10.70 --> 11.14]  Dashboard!
[11.30 --> 12.68]  Your UI sucks.
[13.08 --> 17.02]  If you have your Twitter linked up to your Twitch, it's already tweeted out the wrong title.
[17.48 --> 17.80]  Yeah, I know.
[18.10 --> 18.32]  Okay.
[23.76 --> 26.88]  At least this will fix the VOD, though.
[28.00 --> 28.56]  The VOD.
[28.94 --> 29.26]  Mm-hmm.
[29.26 --> 31.98]  The Archive, whatever people want to call it.
[32.48 --> 33.42]  So, sorry, what were you saying?
[34.98 --> 36.16]  Uh, I don't remember.
[36.82 --> 38.00]  Something about a fly something?
[38.80 --> 39.16]  Fly?
[39.48 --> 39.74]  Yeah.
[40.82 --> 41.62]  U-O-L-T-T.
[42.02 --> 49.14]  Oh, right, they had their first big kind of match meetup thing today, but it was before the LAN show, so I wasn't able to go.
[49.66 --> 50.98]  Yeah, I saw that, too.
[51.42 --> 54.16]  And I was just like, someone was asking me if I was going to join.
[54.24 --> 55.52]  I was like, I'm working.
[55.80 --> 56.08]  Yeah.
[56.08 --> 59.56]  Wait, this is a horrible time.
[60.04 --> 61.80]  This doesn't really work for me.
[61.80 --> 64.68]  I can't just be like, no, I'm going to not work.
[65.16 --> 65.60]  Peaceful.
[65.60 --> 66.64]  And fly internet spaceships.
[66.90 --> 69.02]  I would love to, but that's not how the world works.
[69.02 --> 69.82]  That'd be pretty sweet.
[70.42 --> 74.44]  Unfortunately, despite it being a simulator, you're still in real life.
[74.44 --> 76.32]  What a shame.
[76.66 --> 76.86]  Yeah.
[77.04 --> 82.90]  Speaking of simulators in real life, I got confirmation that Parrot is sending our Bebop.
[83.54 --> 83.94]  Nice.
[84.32 --> 91.72]  And then I've actually had, I don't know what it is, maybe it's our Bebop coverage from CES, but I've had like three other drone makers reach out in the last couple days.
[91.82 --> 92.00]  Cool.
[92.30 --> 92.88]  Sounds are sweet.
[92.88 --> 96.26]  One from Horizon, one from some other things.
[96.28 --> 96.82]  Probably not DJI.
[97.30 --> 98.60]  Not DJI, actually.
[98.98 --> 99.20]  Dang.
[99.34 --> 104.24]  I had one other one reach out that has a really great gimbal system from the reviews that I was looking at.
[104.24 --> 104.30]  Cool.
[104.30 --> 108.52]  And like, yeah, a lot of it looks pretty cool.
[108.52 --> 112.36]  But I do want to do the Bebop first, just because that one's already on route.
[112.74 --> 112.84]  Yep.
[113.26 --> 120.14]  Another thing that's confirmed is that Obutu or Obuto gaming station thing.
[120.48 --> 120.74]  Oh.
[120.90 --> 129.86]  So they sent it, the triple monitor mount, and I got in touch with SciTech about their X55 Hotas.
[130.50 --> 130.78]  Cool.
[131.00 --> 131.46]  Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[131.52 --> 131.94]  So that's cool.
[131.94 --> 140.10]  I haven't heard from Thrustmaster about the A10 one, but I wasn't really expecting them to send that to us for review anyway, because we're not really well established in that category.
[140.46 --> 140.64]  Yeah.
[140.72 --> 142.00]  And it's extremely expensive.
[142.12 --> 142.56]  Yes, it is.
[142.78 --> 147.18]  And I've heard the SciTech one is pretty good from that, um, crap, what was that?
[147.22 --> 147.96]  PC Gamer or something?
[147.98 --> 148.58]  Was it PC Gamer?
[148.64 --> 150.00]  Yeah, they're not popular right now, hey?
[151.04 --> 152.28]  Was it PC Gamer, though?
[152.66 --> 155.36]  Was it the article about PC Master Race?
[155.52 --> 156.34]  No, no, no, no, not that.
[156.34 --> 156.86]  I think it was.
[157.18 --> 159.72]  No, not the PC Master Race article, the Hotas one.
[159.74 --> 160.08]  I think it was, yeah.
[160.08 --> 160.42]  Okay, yeah.
[160.42 --> 161.92]  I thought so, I wasn't sure.
[162.28 --> 165.50]  Yeah, so, uh, PC Gamer is, like, on everyone's crap list.
[166.06 --> 167.50]  Oh, I've got, oh, focus your camera.
[167.64 --> 168.48]  I could sit up.
[168.66 --> 171.56]  That would also, that would also address it, but I'm tired, so.
[172.20 --> 172.56]  Um.
[173.26 --> 174.66]  It's the after fart.
[174.84 --> 176.52]  People are like, Luke, focus the camera.
[176.60 --> 178.20]  As if he knows how to focus a camera.
[178.38 --> 178.90]  Yes, I do.
[180.06 --> 182.12]  I bet you wouldn't be able to do it on the first try.
[182.60 --> 184.14]  I bet you'd touch the other thing first.
[184.68 --> 186.22]  It'd be like a 50-50 chance.
[187.00 --> 188.62]  You know there's two dials on the lens, right?
[188.62 --> 188.72]  Yeah.
[188.72 --> 191.90]  Would you know which one is focus?
[192.10 --> 192.98]  I'd have to look.
[193.98 --> 196.06]  I usually do get it right first time.
[196.70 --> 198.64]  I've got people asking for rumble updates.
[199.02 --> 201.18]  Um, he's still actually at the vet.
[201.18 --> 204.06]  I have not, uh, I have not been.
[204.06 --> 205.26]  Let's get this badge thing going.
[206.08 --> 206.86]  Yeah, sure.
[207.44 --> 208.20]  Uh, fire up paint.
[208.40 --> 211.44]  I, I haven't been doing updates because, like, he's mostly out of the woods.
[211.50 --> 212.32]  It looks like it's fine.
[212.34 --> 213.62]  But he's still running a bit of a fever.
[214.12 --> 216.86]  Uh, he passed a hairball from his butt today.
[217.36 --> 220.32]  Uh, although he still has some of the barium beads inside.
[220.58 --> 222.28]  Uh, Doc gave him an enema today.
[222.28 --> 226.28]  I mean, these are things I'm not even sure if you guys wanted me to, whoops, post on Twitter.
[226.90 --> 228.06]  This thing is gross.
[228.32 --> 229.72]  Doc gave him an enema today.
[230.18 --> 230.96]  Are you supposed to use it with a pen?
[230.96 --> 231.32]  You know what?
[231.44 --> 232.00]  Not like...
[232.00 --> 235.52]  I don't even want to hear that from you because that is nothing compared to your keyboard at
[235.52 --> 235.96]  your desk.
[236.34 --> 237.16]  There's something else going on with that keyboard.
[237.16 --> 239.36]  That thing has some crusty ass shit on it.
[239.36 --> 242.94]  I use my personal keyboard more and my personal keyboard's in way better condition.
[243.08 --> 244.42]  There's something going on with that keyboard.
[245.36 --> 249.50]  Because, like, every time I sit down at your computer to, like, edit something, I'm just
[249.50 --> 253.70]  like, this is some rank, this is some rank stuff going on.
[253.74 --> 254.50]  Well, it's not...
[254.50 --> 255.28]  Now we're sitting up.
[255.36 --> 256.24]  Now you're too late, Burkle.
[257.34 --> 258.74]  Burkle thought he was saving you all.
[258.74 --> 259.02]  There's no point.
[259.22 --> 260.04]  Well, we saw the comment.
[260.34 --> 260.76]  Alright, try.
[262.14 --> 263.52]  Alright, this is working.
[263.74 --> 265.18]  You guys already got that thing dirty.
[266.40 --> 266.84]  What?
[267.24 --> 267.44]  What?
[267.44 --> 269.32]  This is...
[269.32 --> 270.92]  Get out of here, troll.
[272.50 --> 273.42]  Okay, okay.
[273.78 --> 275.34]  I don't know what size this is supposed to be.
[276.88 --> 278.60]  Oh, well, you're the only ones who would know.
[278.88 --> 279.08]  So...
[279.08 --> 279.66]  Give me a moment.
[279.82 --> 280.24]  Yeah.
[280.56 --> 281.76]  I can figure it out.
[281.86 --> 282.80]  Can you figure it out?
[282.88 --> 283.76]  What did you do?
[284.00 --> 285.46]  I plugged in an HDMI cable.
[285.46 --> 286.40]  Why did this break so much?
[286.58 --> 287.68]  Oh, oh, okay.
[287.76 --> 288.28]  Hold on a second.
[288.32 --> 288.62]  Here we go.
[288.62 --> 289.16]  It looks like it's...
[289.16 --> 289.72]  Okay, there we go.
[289.74 --> 290.48]  It's duplicated now.
[290.84 --> 291.10]  Alright.
[291.52 --> 297.42]  So, we are going to be creating, on the after party today, custom badges.
[297.44 --> 300.68]  Are they badges?
[301.04 --> 301.32]  Badges?
[301.32 --> 301.74]  Yeah, they're badges.
[301.74 --> 301.88]  Yeah.
[301.96 --> 302.14]  Good.
[302.50 --> 306.66]  Custom badges for contributors to our new office campaign.
[306.98 --> 312.44]  You know, the number of people who complained on part one of my motherboard painting video...
[312.44 --> 313.40]  Moving the most rare.
[313.46 --> 313.96]  About how...
[313.96 --> 314.36]  Oh, sorry.
[314.58 --> 315.04]  No, it's okay.
[315.12 --> 319.82]  About how we asked for a bunch of money to move offices, and then we released a video with technical issues.
[320.10 --> 322.92]  It's like, okay, I'm going to clue you guys in.
[323.62 --> 326.04]  That video was not scripted.
[326.32 --> 326.94]  Oops, oops, oops.
[326.94 --> 331.54]  What am I going to do when we discover that there's some hissing in the audio and some static?
[331.88 --> 333.52]  Am I going to unpaint the motherboard?
[333.52 --> 336.46]  Like, I'm sorry.
[336.96 --> 338.60]  And it was an issue.
[338.72 --> 339.42]  We're aware of it.
[339.48 --> 342.36]  But like, what were you expecting?
[343.18 --> 345.30]  What were we supposed to actually do?
[346.30 --> 347.16]  I don't know.
[347.56 --> 348.74]  It's a mystery to me.
[348.74 --> 362.18]  Like, some of the complaints people have about things, and the number of people who were saying that they disliked the video because we wrecked the board, was like, we didn't know if the board was working yet.
[362.32 --> 364.62]  Like, yeah, I was stressed about it, and I was...
[364.62 --> 365.38]  Did you release part two?
[365.52 --> 367.08]  I was expressing my stress.
[367.62 --> 374.42]  But like, to say I hate it because the board is destroyed is presumptuous.
[374.42 --> 381.94]  Part two, and I actually do know whether it lives or not now, part two will be out this weekend.
[382.04 --> 383.94]  We aren't going to be leaving it a whole week.
[384.18 --> 389.46]  A lot of people were upset because they thought we did a two-parter and that it was going to take like a couple of weeks.
[389.64 --> 392.38]  The reality of it is we got back from CES.
[392.72 --> 394.24]  Half the company has been out sick.
[394.46 --> 396.94]  If anyone's still here, I need the charging cable for the Jay-Z.
[399.12 --> 403.76]  Half the company was out sick this week, so it's a miracle we managed to make any videos at all.
[403.76 --> 412.14]  I thought that it was going to go relatively quickly, but as you guys probably observed in the footage that we conveniently had playing for you,
[412.32 --> 418.04]  it took a really long time to mask everything correctly, and so it just took more time than I hoped.
[418.14 --> 429.50]  So it was either split it or have nothing for that day, and I'll be damned if I'm going to give up my three-plus year-long streak of new content every single day
[429.50 --> 434.06]  over something like that.
[434.38 --> 441.22]  So had I had people in the office to help me make things faster, things might have gone a little bit better,
[441.64 --> 444.14]  and we might have been able to have something else instead.
[444.26 --> 444.56]  Thank you.
[444.60 --> 445.66]  Do you mind plugging it in down there?
[445.66 --> 448.72]  I didn't hear you when you said that, and I was watching this when I happened.
[449.14 --> 451.56]  So just go play in the stream when you said that.
[451.68 --> 452.04]  That's awesome.
[452.04 --> 453.02]  That delay happened.
[453.58 --> 458.74]  So yeah, I wasn't going to give that up, and the reality of it is we only split things into multiple parts.
[458.86 --> 462.12]  If they are very editing time intensive, and that's something people don't consider,
[462.22 --> 463.84]  oh, it doesn't take that long to paint a motherboard.
[464.00 --> 464.88]  This should have been one video.
[464.88 --> 469.02]  If they're very editing time intensive, or if they're very creation time intensive.
[470.04 --> 475.12]  And this was one of those things where it just took more time than I was expecting, and so it is what it is.
[475.18 --> 477.80]  But we're going to have it released as quickly as we can.
[478.38 --> 479.84]  I've got people asking what watch I'm wearing.
[479.90 --> 481.06]  This is the G Watch R.
[481.18 --> 482.90]  I'm actually in the middle of a review on it.
[483.08 --> 488.10]  So this will be my second look at Android Wear, and my first look at Android Wear 5.0 Lollipop.
[488.44 --> 489.66]  Is that as much as we can Zoom?
[489.84 --> 490.94]  That's as much as we can Zoom.
[491.04 --> 492.72]  Okay, so do you want to...
[492.72 --> 493.24]  Do you want to...
[493.24 --> 494.46]  Oh, here.
[494.88 --> 500.12]  Do you want to grab my laptop, then, and find out who we're making first?
[500.22 --> 500.50]  Yes.
[500.98 --> 501.64]  Should we take turns?
[502.62 --> 502.98]  Sure.
[503.48 --> 504.94]  I'm just going to make us a little bit bigger here.
[504.96 --> 507.24]  Or we can just kind of like, yeah, take turns on the same person.
[509.40 --> 509.72]  What?
[509.96 --> 510.30]  You know.
[512.10 --> 514.70]  They probably want a three input thing.
[514.70 --> 515.38]  Okay, can I just...
[515.38 --> 516.04]  Their username.
[516.24 --> 517.96]  Can I just reach my hand into your lap?
[517.96 --> 518.52]  Both of us.
[518.52 --> 518.74]  Here.
[519.58 --> 521.76]  Adjusting and messing around with their username.
[522.08 --> 522.40]  Okay.
[523.24 --> 524.08]  All right.
[524.88 --> 531.80]  That awkward moment when for the first time ever, it was someone other than Linus who took
[531.80 --> 532.34]  it too far.
[532.34 --> 532.60]  Oh.
[536.94 --> 537.38]  Okay.
[537.54 --> 538.42]  Did you get to see her rack, though?
[538.96 --> 539.48]  I'm sorry?
[539.74 --> 540.00]  What?
[540.00 --> 541.28]  Oh, yeah.
[541.38 --> 541.98]  I totally saw.
[542.04 --> 542.92]  I saw all her racks.
[545.48 --> 545.88]  Okay.
[546.02 --> 548.02]  So I've never actually used a Wacom before.
[548.12 --> 548.24]  Oh.
[548.96 --> 549.28]  Wow.
[550.12 --> 552.60]  And we're off to a good start.
[554.28 --> 554.64]  Okay.
[554.64 --> 555.64]  Okay.
[555.64 --> 558.06]  So I'm going full tablet with this.
[558.22 --> 560.82]  Like, I'm going tablet only.
[561.50 --> 561.74]  Okay.
[561.74 --> 563.44]  Here's my art zone.
[564.14 --> 564.66]  So...
[564.66 --> 568.86]  Oh, I guess I should make this a little bit bigger, even if it's just for the...
[568.86 --> 571.86]  I got this.
[571.90 --> 573.30]  It's not that easy to use.
[573.64 --> 574.30]  I missed.
[574.86 --> 575.22]  I missed.
[575.22 --> 575.66]  I don't even...
[575.66 --> 579.46]  Do you know that there's people who do all their video editing on a Wacom?
[580.26 --> 580.92]  Isn't that crazy?
[581.00 --> 583.40]  Especially in Premiere, where all the buttons are so freaking small.
[583.50 --> 584.50]  I don't even know how you do that.
[585.64 --> 587.02]  Well, they claim it's more accurate.
[587.20 --> 591.62]  I think this is just a fundamental design problem with Premiere more than anything else.
[591.92 --> 594.46]  But, you know, whatever.
[594.46 --> 596.24]  It's not like Adobe's going to listen to me.
[596.64 --> 598.02]  What is that Linus guy now?
[598.10 --> 601.84]  He's just a YouTuber who, you know, has to use our software.
[602.06 --> 603.24]  Is this upside down?
[605.68 --> 606.96]  Well, that's the problem.
[607.10 --> 607.62]  Well, it helps.
[607.78 --> 607.98]  Okay.
[608.04 --> 609.86]  Well, this was pepcac, so fine.
[609.86 --> 612.86]  So the first one we need to do...
[613.42 --> 614.86]  No, I need...
[614.86 --> 616.76]  You know what?
[616.82 --> 620.62]  I am going to maximize this because I can't even see what I'm doing.
[621.48 --> 621.84]  Okay.
[622.08 --> 624.06]  So we're going to sit in the bottom corner.
[624.60 --> 625.04]  There!
[625.42 --> 626.76]  Now I won't cover up anything.
[627.32 --> 628.44]  Now everything is happy.
[628.64 --> 628.84]  Okay.
[629.20 --> 631.66]  So the first one we're doing is for Rope Send.
[632.10 --> 632.84]  Rope Send?
[633.12 --> 633.34]  Yep.
[633.66 --> 633.96]  Okay.
[634.06 --> 635.84]  Well, Rope Send gets a red background.
[636.10 --> 637.60]  It also happens to be a gold contributor.
[637.98 --> 639.44]  Also happens to be a gold contributor.
[639.44 --> 640.44]  Well, we are going...
[640.44 --> 642.72]  As in like the monthly contrib, not the...
[642.72 --> 642.94]  Yeah.
[642.94 --> 648.30]  We are adding some gold and nothing says contribute like an arrow.
[651.62 --> 652.14]  What?
[654.62 --> 655.94]  It makes me think of McDonald's.
[657.22 --> 658.64]  Well, now it's blue.
[658.86 --> 659.22]  Okay.
[659.66 --> 660.12]  Okay.
[660.12 --> 663.12]  And then we're going to need...
[663.12 --> 664.36]  We're going to go with green.
[664.62 --> 665.06]  All right.
[665.28 --> 667.24]  For the inside of the arrow.
[667.84 --> 669.12]  It's like Inception arrows.
[669.34 --> 670.02]  Oh, what happened?
[670.36 --> 671.12]  Now I'm confused.
[671.90 --> 672.26]  Okay.
[672.40 --> 673.40]  Now the arrow is blue.
[673.74 --> 673.94]  Oh.
[673.94 --> 674.94]  Now...
[674.94 --> 685.74]  I'm going to assume for a moment that, you know, that this avatar is desirable because it's
[685.74 --> 686.18]  made by me.
[686.22 --> 687.24]  So I'm going to go ahead and sign it.
[688.06 --> 688.50]  Oh, wow.
[690.02 --> 690.76]  There you go.
[690.88 --> 691.56]  Oh, jeez.
[691.56 --> 697.68]  And because I'm in an extremely good mood right now, I think it needs a happy face.
[699.34 --> 699.74]  Okay.
[699.94 --> 700.80]  You're already on pencil.
[701.18 --> 701.44]  Yeah.
[701.56 --> 702.18]  I'm on pencil.
[702.52 --> 702.84]  Hold on.
[702.90 --> 704.34]  I want a thicker, thicker pencil.
[704.46 --> 704.90]  There you go.
[705.60 --> 705.86]  Okay.
[705.92 --> 706.96]  That might be a little thick.
[707.46 --> 708.12]  Oh, no.
[708.40 --> 708.58]  Whoa.
[708.78 --> 709.36]  Oh, oh.
[709.72 --> 710.44]  You can erase.
[710.44 --> 711.26]  I don't know.
[711.38 --> 711.60]  Okay.
[711.74 --> 711.96]  Okay.
[712.18 --> 716.70]  So the rule for creating these badges is no undo, but you can erase.
[716.90 --> 717.22]  What?
[717.48 --> 718.50]  Did he not plug it in?
[718.50 --> 718.60]  No.
[721.88 --> 723.94]  Apparently, I wasn't clear enough.
[728.14 --> 730.88]  I was like, how is that possibly a problem right now?
[731.72 --> 733.16]  And no?
[733.96 --> 734.20]  Huh?
[734.46 --> 735.52]  Oh, dang it.
[735.60 --> 738.72]  I unplugged this while I was leaning over there.
[738.72 --> 739.12]  Okay.
[740.44 --> 742.18]  We are now plugged.
[742.18 --> 743.08]  And we're golden.
[743.38 --> 744.28]  And the screen got dimmer.
[744.42 --> 747.44]  Someone has screwed up this computer.
[748.26 --> 748.62]  Okay.
[749.56 --> 750.88]  So, okay.
[750.92 --> 751.86]  Are we not allowed to erase?
[752.06 --> 754.60]  We're not allowed to undo, but we can erase.
[754.78 --> 755.38]  Oh, jeez.
[755.38 --> 755.66]  Oh.
[756.00 --> 757.28]  I guess you could bucket that.
[757.40 --> 760.60]  I guess I could, but that seems like cheating.
[760.86 --> 761.90]  Maybe that's one of the eyes.
[762.22 --> 762.36]  Yeah.
[762.54 --> 763.22]  No, no.
[763.26 --> 764.10]  That's not an eye anymore.
[764.20 --> 765.20]  Now that's the face.
[765.56 --> 765.82]  Oh.
[766.02 --> 766.22]  Oh.
[768.38 --> 769.54]  Oh, I got the wrong color.
[769.54 --> 770.26]  There you go.
[770.44 --> 772.80]  Oh.
[774.58 --> 774.98]  Oh.
[775.72 --> 776.12]  Okay.
[776.68 --> 777.62]  Oh, yeah.
[777.74 --> 778.38]  He's grinning.
[778.70 --> 779.02]  Yeah.
[779.24 --> 780.82]  And his head's like kind of on an angle.
[780.94 --> 782.24]  I mean, he looks pretty happy, right?
[782.52 --> 782.78]  Yeah.
[782.84 --> 786.98]  He's like, I got an up arrow, some random freaking line, a signature, and a happy face.
[787.40 --> 787.86]  Okay.
[788.10 --> 790.32]  I like this one, but I think it needs a triangle.
[790.78 --> 791.18]  Okay.
[791.18 --> 791.26]  Okay.
[791.92 --> 793.26]  That's, yeah, that's logical.
[794.32 --> 794.88]  Oh, wow.
[794.88 --> 798.60]  Oh, that is some premium.
[798.96 --> 800.96]  Oh, see, I keep forgetting this.
[801.10 --> 801.30]  Okay.
[801.86 --> 802.84]  So, like, oops.
[803.16 --> 803.88]  Yeah, it's done now.
[804.08 --> 804.36]  Okay.
[804.42 --> 805.12]  Now, hold on a second.
[805.32 --> 806.40]  Now we need the bucket.
[808.16 --> 808.60]  Boom.
[808.60 --> 808.72]  Boom.
[809.92 --> 812.66]  And I think that looks more like a house than an arrow now.
[813.00 --> 814.10]  So we're going to need a door.
[814.24 --> 815.14]  It looks like a wizard.
[819.04 --> 819.48]  Oh.
[819.96 --> 821.66]  Now it's a censored wizard.
[821.66 --> 822.38]  It's a wizard house.
[822.38 --> 823.82]  Okay.
[824.66 --> 825.86]  Our first one is done.
[826.16 --> 826.64]  All right.
[826.82 --> 827.62]  Save as.
[828.94 --> 829.42]  Pictures.
[830.50 --> 831.98]  Sorry, can I get the name again?
[832.28 --> 832.90]  Rope send.
[833.28 --> 834.24]  Rope send.
[837.84 --> 838.48]  Sweet.
[838.80 --> 839.34]  All right.
[839.48 --> 841.66]  Custom one-of-a-kind badge.
[841.98 --> 842.54]  Done.
[843.26 --> 847.52]  Our next one is Brace Yourself 07.
[847.56 --> 847.86]  All right.
[847.94 --> 848.32]  Here you go.
[848.36 --> 848.66]  You're up.
[848.78 --> 849.00]  Okay.
[849.90 --> 851.22]  Fresh blank slate.
[851.22 --> 852.56]  This is going to be interesting.
[853.56 --> 855.24]  I guess, yeah, I'll just go like this.
[855.74 --> 856.56]  I'll do commentary.
[856.86 --> 857.10]  Okay.
[857.84 --> 858.56]  So, wait.
[858.68 --> 858.82]  How do I?
[858.82 --> 859.78]  He picks up the Wacom.
[860.18 --> 861.72]  He points the pen at the surface.
[861.84 --> 863.36]  Oh, he moves to the left corner.
[863.62 --> 865.02]  He's finding the save icon.
[865.14 --> 865.36]  Nope.
[865.48 --> 865.66]  Nope.
[865.72 --> 866.88]  He wasn't going for the save icon.
[867.02 --> 868.92]  He was going for the brand new canvas.
[869.98 --> 873.10]  He created that canvas, but it's the wrong size.
[873.64 --> 874.32]  He resorts.
[874.44 --> 876.24]  Oh, he just about dropped the laptop.
[876.46 --> 877.76]  He resorts to the touch pad.
[877.76 --> 880.34]  He needs to resize that canvas here pretty quickly, folks,
[880.34 --> 881.80]  or he's going to run out of time.
[882.20 --> 884.56]  But Wacom is now positioned on his abs.
[884.62 --> 887.20]  And I can say abs because he's lost a lot of weight in the last little bit.
[887.44 --> 890.40]  He's looking a lot better this season than he was last season when he was just,
[890.48 --> 894.96]  he had a goals against average that just wasn't getting enough yardage for the alley-oop.
[894.96 --> 898.04]  Okay, I'm out of gas here.
[898.34 --> 899.96]  Why is, uh...
[899.96 --> 901.50]  There we go.
[901.60 --> 902.06]  That was weird.
[902.18 --> 903.46]  People are, like, too loud.
[903.88 --> 904.60]  50, it was...
[904.60 --> 905.74]  When am I ever not too loud?
[905.88 --> 907.30]  I don't remember the aspect ratio anymore.
[907.60 --> 908.04]  God.
[911.82 --> 915.42]  We have to do a garage sale at some point here.
[915.56 --> 916.28]  Image info.
[916.82 --> 917.56]  53.45.
[917.56 --> 921.34]  I need to sell, like, the iMac because I'm not going to use it.
[921.58 --> 921.90]  Yes.
[922.58 --> 928.60]  Um, I feel like I should be, like, doing garage sale while you're doing this or something.
[928.72 --> 929.44]  You can.
[929.72 --> 930.48]  Or one of us could...
[930.48 --> 933.80]  No, I'll get everything together this week.
[933.94 --> 934.86]  Brace yourself.
[935.28 --> 936.24]  And, uh...
[936.24 --> 937.56]  So I'm going to have, like...
[938.42 --> 940.30]  Oh, that wasn't what I wanted.
[941.14 --> 941.82]  No undo.
[943.16 --> 943.92]  You're going to...
[943.92 --> 945.62]  Really, you're going to wuss out and erase it?
[945.90 --> 946.30]  Yeah, dude.
[946.30 --> 947.26]  That's how it's going to be?
[947.42 --> 948.08]  I need brown.
[948.22 --> 949.04]  Can I grab my laptop?
[949.20 --> 950.28]  I need blue.
[950.40 --> 951.04]  Do you need the brown?
[951.24 --> 951.94]  I need water.
[952.84 --> 954.26]  So I need water in the bottom.
[956.04 --> 957.02]  What are you making?
[957.50 --> 958.26]  Why is this...
[959.70 --> 961.34]  Oh, it's because I have a blue eraser.
[961.70 --> 961.92]  God.
[962.88 --> 964.88]  Why would anyone want a blue eraser?
[965.08 --> 965.82]  I don't know.
[966.16 --> 967.42]  Actually, blue erasers...
[967.42 --> 968.44]  The background is blue.
[969.34 --> 975.38]  I wonder if kids, like my kids, will even know that blue erasers were code for pen.
[975.38 --> 975.70]  Yeah.
[976.30 --> 980.58]  Like, that will never be relevant to them in their lives.
[980.76 --> 980.94]  No.
[981.64 --> 981.86]  No.
[982.08 --> 982.30]  Okay.
[982.58 --> 983.40]  So we've got water.
[984.16 --> 984.76]  We've got water.
[984.84 --> 985.50]  Now I need brown.
[985.50 --> 990.44]  And I'm going to have a boat.
[997.44 --> 998.08]  Boat.
[998.08 --> 1003.06]  I'm pulling out pretty much all of my art skills here.
[1005.22 --> 1006.90]  So this can probably...
[1006.90 --> 1010.84]  This is probably worth a lot more than how much these custom badges cost.
[1010.98 --> 1013.98]  Because he'd probably be able to sell this at, like, art dealerships and stuff.
[1015.04 --> 1016.48]  Just in case anyone was wondering.
[1016.48 --> 1026.38]  If you notice, the detailing on the boat is, like, pretty insane.
[1027.34 --> 1030.10]  There's different textures, even, on the boat.
[1030.10 --> 1031.92]  Yeah.
[1032.66 --> 1033.88]  It even has a mast.
[1037.88 --> 1038.88]  Which is pretty...
[1038.88 --> 1041.92]  They're not even going to be able to see that when it's actual size, you know.
[1042.52 --> 1045.38]  It's just going to look like a brown and blue smear.
[1045.48 --> 1047.04]  Although, I will give you this.
[1047.10 --> 1048.42]  It does look like a boat.
[1048.80 --> 1050.10]  Are you going to have animals on the boat?
[1050.30 --> 1051.36]  Like, just little squares?
[1051.82 --> 1053.38]  Like a yellow square for a giraffe?
[1054.20 --> 1055.20]  Is it like Noah's Ark?
[1055.80 --> 1057.40]  That's probably not a bad idea.
[1058.40 --> 1059.48]  What else are you going to do, though?
[1060.52 --> 1061.44]  Okay, so...
[1061.44 --> 1061.92]  Oh!
[1062.14 --> 1062.92]  Brace yourselves.
[1063.40 --> 1063.76]  Get it?
[1065.16 --> 1066.04]  Brace yourselves.
[1066.08 --> 1067.18]  They're going too quickly.
[1069.00 --> 1070.14]  They're going to hit the land.
[1070.54 --> 1070.90]  Wow.
[1072.44 --> 1074.40]  Are you going to be on the land?
[1075.10 --> 1075.46]  Sure.
[1076.32 --> 1076.68]  Okay.
[1077.38 --> 1078.62]  I'm going to be way too tall, though.
[1078.88 --> 1081.22]  You're going to be, like, way taller than the boat at this point.
[1081.28 --> 1081.54]  Right.
[1081.70 --> 1082.30]  But that's okay.
[1082.30 --> 1083.92]  I mean, this is some...
[1083.92 --> 1085.18]  Unless I'm just like, alright.
[1085.46 --> 1086.52]  If I'm like...
[1086.52 --> 1088.26]  This is some grade 2 artwork, anyway.
[1088.44 --> 1089.98]  So I think it's probably fine.
[1090.00 --> 1091.14]  No, this is art gallery artwork.
[1091.38 --> 1092.36]  Art gallery artwork.
[1092.36 --> 1093.52]  Yeah, you just don't understand.
[1093.62 --> 1095.16]  They can have grade 2 art galleries.
[1095.92 --> 1097.84]  People are like Titanic 2.0 already.
[1098.24 --> 1098.58]  Oh, yeah.
[1098.78 --> 1100.70]  It's not nearly as good as the Titanic.
[1102.20 --> 1102.84]  It's like...
[1102.84 --> 1103.56]  It's like...
[1103.56 --> 1104.76]  It's like Titanic...
[1104.76 --> 1105.36]  That's me.
[1107.40 --> 1108.62]  That looks like a rock.
[1109.56 --> 1110.56]  I'm an Anuksuk.
[1111.04 --> 1111.34]  Right.
[1111.34 --> 1112.90]  No one's going to know what that is.
[1113.32 --> 1114.00]  I know what that is.
[1114.30 --> 1114.96]  I meant...
[1114.96 --> 1115.74]  It's a rock man.
[1116.46 --> 1117.44]  Made of rocks.
[1118.48 --> 1120.42]  If it would be helpful, I could pose like one.
[1120.54 --> 1122.44]  So, it's now a pirate ship.
[1124.10 --> 1124.60]  Uh-huh.
[1125.46 --> 1127.96]  Because that is what a sail looks like.
[1127.96 --> 1134.30]  Oh, my goodness.
[1135.80 --> 1137.42]  Okay, the sails may be pretty bad.
[1137.76 --> 1139.20]  I'm going to make it squarish.
[1140.04 --> 1140.38]  Right.
[1140.56 --> 1142.10]  Because that is what a sail looks like.
[1142.14 --> 1143.58]  I mean, you played enough Assassin's Creed...
[1143.58 --> 1145.08]  Whatever.
[1145.22 --> 1145.92]  The one with the boats.
[1146.14 --> 1149.76]  This is basically if they did the boat stuff in Unity.
[1149.76 --> 1156.46]  So, is that why the Anuksuk guy has no legs?
[1156.52 --> 1157.12]  Because he was digging?
[1157.84 --> 1158.06]  Yeah.
[1158.64 --> 1158.84]  Yeah.
[1159.40 --> 1160.52]  Okay, so...
[1160.52 --> 1163.78]  In the spirit of that, I'm going to put an Ubisoft logo in the corner.
[1163.96 --> 1166.32]  I'm just going to interact with Twitch chat because...
[1166.32 --> 1168.06]  I've had enough of your crap.
[1168.14 --> 1168.86]  Ubisoft logo!
[1168.86 --> 1169.72]  I'm trying to show me up.
[1169.86 --> 1171.24]  Look, there's an Ubisoft logo now.
[1172.10 --> 1174.56]  That is not going to be visible at all.
[1174.88 --> 1177.46]  It's going to be like one-tenth that size.
[1180.08 --> 1180.56]  There.
[1181.62 --> 1184.16]  Creepy Jesus says, better textures than Unity.
[1184.44 --> 1185.28]  Brace yourself.
[1186.08 --> 1186.78]  All right.
[1186.84 --> 1188.26]  You're crashing into the land.
[1188.34 --> 1188.70]  Hold up.
[1188.78 --> 1190.20]  Go ahead and save that nonsense.
[1191.20 --> 1192.86]  I'm adding a sun in the corner.
[1193.28 --> 1193.80]  All right.
[1193.80 --> 1197.28]  Oh, someone says red vertical stripes on the sail, please.
[1197.28 --> 1203.30]  That would be some pretty difficult to distinguish stuff going on.
[1203.44 --> 1204.44]  No, it's a pirate ship.
[1204.52 --> 1205.44]  It has this going crossbones.
[1205.52 --> 1205.98]  I think we're good.
[1206.08 --> 1206.62]  There's a sun.
[1206.74 --> 1207.76]  There's an Ubisoft logo.
[1208.20 --> 1208.76]  There's a...
[1208.76 --> 1209.38]  Yeah, we're good.
[1210.98 --> 1211.36]  File.
[1211.82 --> 1212.50]  Save as.
[1219.28 --> 1219.68]  Okay.
[1220.90 --> 1221.36]  You're up.
[1221.36 --> 1221.60]  All right.
[1221.82 --> 1223.46]  Got my K70 RGB today.
[1223.58 --> 1223.82]  All right.
[1223.88 --> 1225.18]  You're on Twitch chat duty.
[1225.44 --> 1225.62]  Yep.
[1225.62 --> 1228.60]  The wretched hive of scum and villainy and all that noise.
[1229.30 --> 1229.66]  Okay.
[1230.60 --> 1231.94]  So you saved it already, right?
[1232.14 --> 1232.36]  Yep.
[1232.62 --> 1232.94]  All right.
[1233.04 --> 1233.90]  Who's our next...
[1233.90 --> 1234.28]  Who's our next...
[1234.28 --> 1237.40]  I would recommend just using the pad to erase it all.
[1237.72 --> 1240.80]  And then save it as something new automatically so you don't screw it up later.
[1241.50 --> 1241.78]  Sure.
[1241.88 --> 1243.84]  Just because resizing and all that stuff is very annoying.
[1244.70 --> 1247.18]  These are some one-of-a-kind artworks.
[1247.36 --> 1248.10]  Yes, they are.
[1249.92 --> 1252.68]  There will definitely be no other badges that look like these.
[1253.38 --> 1253.60]  No.
[1254.56 --> 1254.96]  Okay.
[1256.20 --> 1258.38]  I've decided for the next one I'm going to draw my cat.
[1259.20 --> 1259.60]  Flo-ger.
[1261.10 --> 1261.96]  Or Flo-ger.
[1263.68 --> 1268.14]  But it's capital F, small L, small O, capital G, small E.
[1268.22 --> 1269.46]  I'm going with all lowercase.
[1269.56 --> 1269.76]  Boom.
[1270.20 --> 1270.48]  Okay.
[1270.48 --> 1276.64]  No, I just meant like in terms of saying it, I think it's Flo-ger because of the weird capitalization.
[1277.44 --> 1277.74]  All right.
[1277.74 --> 1281.30]  I'm going with the smallest size because this will be the most finely detailed one yet.
[1282.30 --> 1282.86]  It's your cat.
[1282.86 --> 1283.30]  Yeah.
[1283.30 --> 1283.34]  Yeah.
[1283.50 --> 1284.22]  It's going to be my cat.
[1284.34 --> 1285.04]  So he has ears.
[1285.54 --> 1285.94]  Oh, yeah.
[1288.34 --> 1294.74]  See, the curvature on these ears are actually highly representative of the actual cat.
[1294.74 --> 1295.94]  Yeah.
[1295.94 --> 1299.36]  It's nice when art has a real story behind it.
[1299.36 --> 1304.98]  Not everything that you see in those fancy pants art galleries have real history.
[1305.44 --> 1306.86]  This is from a real cat.
[1306.86 --> 1309.70]  So that has its tongue out.
[1310.70 --> 1310.92]  Yes.
[1311.42 --> 1313.90]  And those things.
[1316.48 --> 1318.10]  He has kind of golden eyes.
[1319.32 --> 1320.06]  Golden eye?
[1320.88 --> 1321.98]  Can he have a gun?
[1322.92 --> 1323.62]  I don't see why not.
[1323.64 --> 1324.96]  Can he be an assassin cat?
[1324.96 --> 1325.46]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1326.12 --> 1326.80]  Spy cat?
[1326.96 --> 1327.72]  Yeah, spy cat.
[1327.72 --> 1329.00]  Oh.
[1330.22 --> 1330.66]  Wow.
[1330.98 --> 1332.08]  Draw me like your French girls.
[1333.48 --> 1334.28]  Oh, jeez.
[1335.22 --> 1336.34]  That's not what that...
[1336.34 --> 1337.02]  It's a tail!
[1339.66 --> 1341.04]  I didn't want to hear.
[1343.42 --> 1344.46]  Oh, man.
[1344.94 --> 1345.66]  You're awful.
[1345.90 --> 1347.48]  That wasn't even what I was implying.
[1347.60 --> 1348.56]  I thought that was his leg.
[1349.78 --> 1351.46]  It's obviously not his leg.
[1351.52 --> 1352.50]  Look, it has stripes.
[1352.50 --> 1354.72]  Well, it has stripes now.
[1357.72 --> 1361.72]  Oh, I guess the paint bucket would probably be faster.
[1361.82 --> 1365.04]  You should show this to him afterwards and see if he has that weird thing where animals
[1365.04 --> 1368.88]  sometimes see themselves on screens and then get all interested.
[1369.32 --> 1370.72]  I don't think that'll be an issue here.
[1370.90 --> 1372.92]  I think it's highly representative.
[1374.26 --> 1374.72]  Oh, wow.
[1375.54 --> 1376.72]  Those are his front legs.
[1376.86 --> 1377.04]  Yeah.
[1378.14 --> 1379.38]  And these...
[1379.38 --> 1382.18]  And his excess chest fur is going in between them.
[1382.26 --> 1382.52]  Yeah.
[1382.92 --> 1383.12]  Yeah.
[1383.20 --> 1384.48]  That's his back legs.
[1384.84 --> 1385.00]  Yeah.
[1385.44 --> 1386.66]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[1386.66 --> 1388.00]  He's lying down, okay?
[1388.40 --> 1388.66]  Okay.
[1388.66 --> 1389.52]  And Rumble has a...
[1389.52 --> 1391.96]  Rumble has a stripe on his ribcage here.
[1392.24 --> 1392.42]  Yeah.
[1392.50 --> 1394.58]  And then other than that, he just has kind of spots.
[1395.12 --> 1395.34]  Yeah.
[1398.02 --> 1398.38]  Okay.
[1398.56 --> 1400.48]  Oh, I guess I should do something with his face.
[1400.58 --> 1401.72]  I think he still needs a pistol.
[1401.98 --> 1402.82]  Make his face blue.
[1403.34 --> 1403.96]  Oh, all right.
[1404.54 --> 1404.90]  That...
[1404.90 --> 1405.08]  Oh.
[1405.56 --> 1405.82]  Huh.
[1406.12 --> 1407.38]  It's because you left a hole right there.
[1407.86 --> 1408.24]  Yeah.
[1408.92 --> 1410.20]  That's going to be hard to fix.
[1410.34 --> 1412.84]  Let's see if the paint bucket will do that for me.
[1412.92 --> 1413.18]  Okay.
[1413.26 --> 1413.36]  Cool.
[1413.36 --> 1413.66]  We're good.
[1413.74 --> 1414.04]  We're good.
[1414.38 --> 1414.76]  We're good.
[1414.82 --> 1415.50]  We've recovered.
[1415.50 --> 1417.66]  We've recovered from what was going to be...
[1417.66 --> 1418.30]  Catastrophic failure.
[1418.62 --> 1420.08]  ...even more abominable.
[1420.40 --> 1422.52]  You're still on a paint bucket, just so you know.
[1422.70 --> 1423.00]  Yeah.
[1423.14 --> 1423.34]  Yeah.
[1423.72 --> 1424.32]  That is...
[1424.32 --> 1424.54]  Nope.
[1424.60 --> 1425.40]  That is appreciated.
[1426.84 --> 1427.32]  Um...
[1427.32 --> 1430.04]  Okay.
[1430.26 --> 1431.50]  What am I going to do with this face?
[1431.54 --> 1433.28]  I might have to stick with brown here.
[1433.38 --> 1435.62]  You can close off that ear and then you can paint bucket it.
[1435.68 --> 1436.02]  Yeah.
[1436.08 --> 1436.78]  That would work.
[1436.88 --> 1437.76]  Well, let's go with...
[1437.76 --> 1438.74]  Let's go with a...
[1438.74 --> 1442.00]  You know, as an homage to the blue background.
[1442.00 --> 1443.98]  We'll close it out with blue.
[1445.90 --> 1446.54]  Uh-huh.
[1447.26 --> 1451.00]  If you close it with blue and then paint bucket...
[1451.00 --> 1453.08]  Yeah.
[1453.38 --> 1453.76]  Okay.
[1453.88 --> 1455.20]  So now I'm going to paint bucket it.
[1455.74 --> 1456.40]  A different blue?
[1456.66 --> 1457.06]  No.
[1457.12 --> 1458.94]  I'm going to go with a slightly different brown.
[1459.12 --> 1460.96]  I am taking it up a notch.
[1460.96 --> 1461.54]  Camo cat.
[1461.54 --> 1466.18]  I am making a slightly different brown.
[1466.36 --> 1470.30]  So this is like a splinter cell cat.
[1470.80 --> 1471.10]  Yeah.
[1471.78 --> 1472.58]  He needs...
[1472.58 --> 1474.74]  Oh, I know what's wrong with this cat.
[1474.84 --> 1475.84]  I know why he doesn't look right.
[1476.00 --> 1477.54]  He needs, um...
[1478.76 --> 1480.26]  He needs the lines in his eyes.
[1480.26 --> 1480.80]  Oh, wow.
[1480.96 --> 1481.64]  You're right.
[1481.84 --> 1482.00]  Yeah.
[1482.50 --> 1483.68]  That totally ties it together.
[1483.96 --> 1484.24]  Yeah.
[1484.90 --> 1486.20]  That's quite a lot better.
[1486.48 --> 1486.68]  Mm-hmm.
[1486.70 --> 1487.20]  And then...
[1487.20 --> 1487.38]  Okay.
[1487.44 --> 1488.40]  So he needed a gun, right?
[1488.64 --> 1488.82]  Mm-hmm.
[1488.82 --> 1489.84]  So that's the finishing touch.
[1489.84 --> 1492.68]  Beautiful.
[1493.38 --> 1493.66]  Yep.
[1495.16 --> 1495.56]  Yep.
[1495.64 --> 1495.88]  Perfect.
[1497.38 --> 1498.20]  Guns are black.
[1499.06 --> 1499.38]  Mm-hmm.
[1500.14 --> 1500.88]  It's a Glock.
[1500.88 --> 1501.34]  It's not perfect yet.
[1501.42 --> 1501.48]  It's a Glock.
[1501.48 --> 1502.22]  But this is Canada.
[1502.58 --> 1503.84]  So it needs an orange tip.
[1504.32 --> 1504.52]  Mm-hmm.
[1504.52 --> 1505.28]  Because this is not...
[1505.28 --> 1506.48]  This is not a dangerous gun.
[1506.74 --> 1506.96]  No.
[1507.98 --> 1508.64]  There we go.
[1508.94 --> 1509.22]  Perfect.
[1509.28 --> 1511.86]  I mean, you wouldn't trust a real gun with a cat, obviously.
[1512.22 --> 1513.14]  We're not silly.
[1513.28 --> 1514.02]  That's just stupid.
[1514.24 --> 1514.44]  Yeah.
[1516.06 --> 1516.46]  Okay.
[1516.46 --> 1518.46]  Let's fix some of these...
[1518.46 --> 1519.66]  Some of these holes in them.
[1520.84 --> 1523.14]  Those were just damage from his spy days.
[1523.62 --> 1523.88]  Okay.
[1524.00 --> 1525.48]  And then, um...
[1525.48 --> 1528.38]  I think he needs, like, a nice plant for ambience.
[1529.32 --> 1529.80]  Ambience.
[1530.04 --> 1530.54]  Excuse me.
[1532.22 --> 1532.70]  Cool.
[1533.34 --> 1533.64]  Yeah.
[1534.38 --> 1535.22]  Is it a fern?
[1535.52 --> 1536.12]  I think it looks like a fern.
[1536.12 --> 1537.10]  It's a maple leaf, but green.
[1537.10 --> 1537.44]  Oh, okay.
[1537.76 --> 1538.06]  All right.
[1538.68 --> 1538.88]  Yeah.
[1539.32 --> 1539.72]  Okay.
[1540.02 --> 1541.10]  Should I have a background color?
[1542.12 --> 1544.08]  He's starting to look a little YOLO swag.
[1545.90 --> 1546.64]  YOLO swag.
[1546.78 --> 1547.42]  He's got a gun.
[1547.50 --> 1549.22]  He's got a maple leaf.
[1551.14 --> 1552.14]  That's a maple leaf.
[1552.52 --> 1553.48]  I'll make it red.
[1554.48 --> 1554.82]  That will...
[1554.82 --> 1555.62]  Will that make you happier?
[1555.88 --> 1556.24]  Probably.
[1556.38 --> 1556.58]  Yeah.
[1556.64 --> 1556.88]  There.
[1556.96 --> 1557.26]  There we go.
[1557.26 --> 1558.04]  Now it's a maple leaf.
[1558.50 --> 1559.06]  All right.
[1559.82 --> 1561.38]  That is looking good.
[1562.60 --> 1563.12]  All right.
[1563.42 --> 1564.18]  You've already got it.
[1564.26 --> 1564.40]  Yeah.
[1564.68 --> 1565.44]  You just need to save.
[1566.02 --> 1566.46]  Boom.
[1566.64 --> 1567.22]  There you go.
[1569.72 --> 1570.24]  All right.
[1570.30 --> 1571.44]  Who's our next lucky winner?
[1571.72 --> 1572.26]  The next one is...
[1572.26 --> 1574.68]  And by winner, I mean they paid for it.
[1580.64 --> 1581.98]  The rabid raccoon.
[1583.82 --> 1585.52]  I think we already have that one.
[1585.88 --> 1586.82]  It's on screen.
[1587.52 --> 1588.02]  Which one?
[1590.20 --> 1590.60]  Oh.
[1591.54 --> 1593.90]  It looks more like an owl than a raccoon anyway.
[1595.50 --> 1596.42]  You already saved?
[1596.52 --> 1597.18]  Give me one second.
[1597.18 --> 1597.30]  Yeah.
[1597.32 --> 1599.80]  I already saved as rabid raccoon, so you just got to erase.
[1600.04 --> 1600.24]  Yeah.
[1600.36 --> 1600.94]  Give me a sec.
[1601.30 --> 1601.84]  Oh, my goodness.
[1601.84 --> 1603.20]  It's freaking out because it'll lock them.
[1603.44 --> 1603.70]  Right.
[1605.18 --> 1606.24]  Don't be a jerk.
[1606.80 --> 1607.92]  It's not even doing anything.
[1608.14 --> 1608.34]  Really?
[1608.52 --> 1608.96]  It's weird.
[1609.12 --> 1610.30]  I'm trying to troll you right now.
[1612.40 --> 1613.20]  What if you let go?
[1613.26 --> 1613.86]  Will it even work?
[1614.40 --> 1614.66]  Oh, yeah.
[1614.70 --> 1615.08]  There we go.
[1616.04 --> 1618.32]  Oh, so it's just one or the other, really.
[1618.48 --> 1619.14]  Oh, that's cool.
[1619.64 --> 1620.82]  That seems like a good idea.
[1624.02 --> 1624.34]  Okay.
[1624.84 --> 1625.26]  All right.
[1625.26 --> 1625.28]  All right.
[1625.28 --> 1625.64]  Here we go.
[1625.64 --> 1626.46]  Rabid raccoon.
[1626.56 --> 1627.96]  What are we doing for rabid raccoon?
[1628.70 --> 1630.48]  I was thinking a rabid raccoon.
[1631.84 --> 1633.38]  To be completely honest.
[1633.48 --> 1634.46]  I thought it was going to go kind of boring.
[1635.56 --> 1639.64]  You could do, like, medication for the raccoon.
[1642.26 --> 1643.60]  What's medication for rabies?
[1644.02 --> 1644.58]  I don't know.
[1644.84 --> 1646.44]  Is it a shot or is it pills?
[1646.58 --> 1647.50]  I think it would be a shot.
[1650.18 --> 1651.00]  We need, like...
[1651.00 --> 1652.18]  Fairly confident it's a shot.
[1656.38 --> 1659.68]  I can't believe how many people are watching us do paint art.
[1660.32 --> 1661.26]  We love you guys.
[1661.26 --> 1670.72]  Wifey wants to know how many custom badges we're doing.
[1671.88 --> 1672.96]  I think there's four more.
[1673.62 --> 1674.08]  Oh, okay.
[1674.12 --> 1674.26]  Three more?
[1674.38 --> 1674.66]  Three more?
[1675.88 --> 1678.04]  Oh, that's not even that many.
[1678.58 --> 1683.44]  And I know I still owe some of the other contributors a personal thank you video.
[1683.44 --> 1685.62]  So, that is definitely planned.
[1686.08 --> 1686.76]  And that will happen.
[1687.60 --> 1688.56]  It's just like I said.
[1688.62 --> 1693.72]  We've had about an average of two and a half people out of the office every day this week.
[1694.92 --> 1699.12]  At our peak, we had four people out of the office in one day sick from CES.
[1699.74 --> 1703.96]  I was making a joke that next year we should get hazard sick days.
[1703.96 --> 1708.36]  Because CES is basically going into a hazard zone at this point.
[1708.40 --> 1710.28]  Yeah, you can have as many hazard sick days as you want.
[1710.36 --> 1710.86]  They just won't be paid.
