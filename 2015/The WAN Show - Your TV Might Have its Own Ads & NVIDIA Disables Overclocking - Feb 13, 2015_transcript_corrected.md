[0.00 → 2.28] All right, it's WAN Showtime again.
[2.74 → 7.84] It's the most exciting show of the week that I host with you.
[8.86 → 13.62] We launched the show based on degradation of radioactive materials
[13.62 → 16.94] so that we're exactly a millisecond on time.
[17.52 → 18.92] Everyone else just has incorrect clocks.
[19.28 → 21.54] Yeah, well, there's a seven-minute time delay
[21.54 → 24.74] so that we can place our bets about the outcome of the show
[24.74 → 27.30] before the betting closes.
[27.52 → 28.66] Everyone else is on a delay.
[29.06 → 29.84] You heard about that, right?
[29.84 → 36.46] Yeah, that was some Bush League stuff going on there.
[37.78 → 40.72] Yes, we want to be taken seriously as a sport.
[40.96 → 47.20] Oh, also, our athletes are going to bet on a time-delayed match.
[47.94 → 54.58] Sorry, event organizer is going to bet on a time-delayed match
[54.58 → 56.70] because they are spectating in the game.
[56.70 → 61.16] So, anyway, let's go ahead and let's get started.
[61.28 → 62.96] We're going to have a great show for you guys today.
[64.42 → 68.24] We've got, actually, tons of great topics.
[68.36 → 73.02] I'm even going to jump away from some of the ones that we did as our teasers at the beginning.
[73.02 → 79.68] Some smart TVs have started just inserting ads into content on their own.
[79.68 → 81.28] That's smart.
[81.28 → 81.76] Cool.
[81.76 → 85.88] France is deploying anti-drone drones at their nuclear plants.
[86.02 → 92.32] There's some stuff going on, like a lot of stuff going on at Frozen CPU.
[92.32 → 96.48] No one is sure exactly what kind of stuff's going on.
[96.94 → 102.82] Also, Apple's activation lock is, like, seriously reducing theft of smartphones all kind of around the world.
[103.32 → 112.24] And NVIDIA is digging even freaking deeper and disabled 900M overclocking with a new driver.
[112.24 → 113.74] So, yeah.
[114.64 → 116.80] Can you drive underground?
[117.80 → 118.28] Yes.
[119.24 → 120.34] They do that for mining.
[120.34 → 120.36] Please.
[142.24 → 149.68] and our sponsors for the show today are lynda.com
[149.68 → 159.96] Dollar Shave Club and oh is that a new one what's that XSplit is that that software we use yeah
[159.96 → 165.34] is that that software that we've been using since we like started on the wan show that we always
[165.34 → 171.66] used to complain about but now that we like yeah oh look at that cool all right guys so let's get
[171.66 → 182.96] right into our first topic here um NVIDIA digs deep as latest 347.29 driver on the GTX 900 m series
[182.96 → 189.38] disables overclocking are you in the twitch chat because i sure am not this was posted by Subaru
[189.38 → 193.38] i can post it I've got it no worries all right i just want to get the twitch chat open I'm using a
[193.38 → 197.66] different laptop this week because there was a bit of an unfortunate occurrence last week
[197.66 → 204.56] thanks to me using my general purpose personal and work laptop on the stream and a technical
[204.56 → 210.56] complication that basically it's a long story and uh the original article here is from tech power up
[210.56 → 215.54] I'm going to go ahead and screen share with you guys so you can have a quick boo at this and some
[215.54 → 224.06] some notebooks um so notably we did a review of the g751 j something or other whatever the g751 Asus
[224.06 → 233.38] updated g750 that features dang it tech power up just mute i guess i can, you're not screen sharing
[233.38 → 240.78] right now I'm not oh you are how is that not going through i don't know yeah i couldn't hear it
[240.78 → 246.40] huh that's bizarre anyway okay so um so right we have a g751 that we reviewed it did have
[246.40 → 252.44] albeit very limited overclocking features enabled and NVIDIA has pushed out a driver update that
[252.44 → 260.34] disables that not only on the 970m and 980m, but my understanding is there's also um another
[260.34 → 268.92] another graphics i think it's the 860m has also had overclocking disabled on it so uh you'll have to
[268.92 → 274.74] you'll have to correct me on that someone in chat says 860m and 850m and 850m too so basically
[274.74 → 281.86] NVIDIA, so some users were upset because they kind of go to dog um so i was overclocking my GPU and my
[281.86 → 290.00] temps were all cool get it temps were cool because cool is good lack of heat lack of heat
[290.00 → 295.68] or lower amount of heat excellent thermal dissipation uh, so my temps are great i was getting all this extra
[295.68 → 300.34] performance i got a new driver update so i could play whatever new game it is that the kids play
[300.34 → 308.10] these days and boom no overclocking all of a sudden so NVIDIA has clarified that GTX 900 m series
[308.10 → 315.48] overclocking was enabled by accident and has therefore since been disabled users were incensed
[315.48 → 320.10] arguing that they should be able to use their hardware as they choose even if it does void the
[320.10 → 325.66] warranty overclocking has been allowed on mobile GPUs from NVIDIA in the past, but we've seen them become
[325.66 → 332.12] a lot more restrictive even on the desktop side in recent years and every architecture seems to add
[332.12 → 338.10] some new functionality designed to let the GPU manage itself versus paying really any attention
[338.10 → 345.92] to user intervention so um my take on this is one you shouldn't be overclocking your notebook GPU anyway
[345.92 → 352.60] so there's that two i think it's a dick move because if you want to break your stuff it should be your
[352.60 → 358.58] right to break your stuff now something that has always baffled me about the whole overclocking
[358.58 → 365.74] thing where manufacturers will say overclocking voids your warranty um, and then they never had any
[365.74 → 371.96] way to tell like if you've ever taken like an iPad into an Apple Store and for warranty replacement
[371.96 → 377.24] the first thing they do is they whip out a flashlight, and they look inside the connectors for those moisture
[377.24 → 382.50] uh those moisture strips and those moisture colour change things because if they're going to say hey look
[382.50 → 386.92] your warranty's void if you drop it in the water then they better have a bloody way to actually back it up
[386.92 → 392.26] otherwise it's all just this it's just gum flapping so something that baffles me is why doesn't NVIDIA
[392.26 → 398.00] just allow us to do whatever we want with it and then actually void the warranty
[398.00 → 410.16] why don't you just why don't you just enforce the policy you already had instead of making a new policy
[410.16 → 416.00] that just makes people mad at you and if it was enabled in the past oh man on like previous
[416.00 → 418.74] if it was enabled on previous
[418.74 → 427.30] if it was enabled on previous versions of NVIDIA mobile GPUs they should just tell people they're
[427.30 → 431.96] having a big communications problem these days yeah i need to just tell people that it would not be
[431.96 → 436.36] enabled the new one if it was is they told people it would not be possible, and then it was accidentally
[436.36 → 441.12] possible, and they took it away that's a totally different story i mean people will still be upset
[441.12 → 449.62] yeah and i would still get it yeah, but it's its it's its incredibly frustrating how incorrectly
[449.62 → 455.80] NVIDIA goes about a lot of this stuff, and you know what i get it honestly this is probably something
[455.80 → 462.04] that comes about due to higher and higher end graphics cores being implemented in these like
[462.04 → 468.56] thin and light designs that we're gonna thermal throttle or be on the edge of it like barely make
[468.56 → 476.52] it is like stuff like the gs70 like this super thin designs Horus's x7 pro hyper thin SLI enabled
[476.52 → 481.96] notebooks they actually don't throttle but as soon as you go ahead, and you start turning things up they
[481.96 → 487.66] will so that's going to create a bad user experience going to potentially make the chips run even hotter
[487.66 → 493.50] therefore reducing their lifespan and the thing about a something that's meant to be implemented into a
[493.50 → 501.66] finished goods product like a notebook GPU is that when that dies like let's say your desktop you know GTX 970
[501.66 → 507.38] that's a what four hundred dollar graphics card let's say that GPU burns out because someone was irresponsible and they
[507.38 → 514.18] they overclocked it they cooked it whatever the case may be if that dies now that's kind of hard these days the GPU boost but
[514.18 → 523.86] regardless if that dies then that's a four hundred dollar RMA replacement that the manufacturer then has to deal with you know your Asus or gigabyte or MSI or whatever else the case may be
[523.86 → 536.50] if your laptop GPU dies all of a sudden we're talking about a two thousand dollar replacement or let's say at the lower end of these high-end GPUs you know a fifteen hundred eighteen hundred
[536.50 → 550.88] dollar even up to you know three thousand dollar device that is now effectively bricked now you can make arguments for oh well then you know they should be doing mobile GPUs on mm modules anyway so that i could just replace the graphics card and
[550.88 → 562.36] and there are arguments to be made for that but if you've seen the kinds of notebooks that feature replaceable graphics cards stuff like the gt80 titan from MSI it's like two inches thick like also
[562.36 → 574.84] and expensive there is more involved in making that stuff modular and in designing an interchangeable system for the cards and the cooling slots because none of that stuff standard, and it's never going to be
[574.84 → 590.20] i get people messaging me all the time suggesting that we do a video about doing a custom-built notebook custom-built notebooks died ages ago like my laptop that i got for university, so this was back in
[590.20 → 602.18] uh how old am I i uh 2004 i guess, so this is about man I'm old okay, so this is over 10 years ago it was an Asus MNE
[602.18 → 613.70] and uh this was back when laptop displays were like 5x4 it was a 12 inch which was a big deal at the time, and you could get an extended battery that stuck out the bottom like this much
[613.70 → 627.40] yeah yeah yeah and acted as a keyboard incline exactly that's why i said they're awesome they were actually perfect, so those were freaking awesome but aside from that so you know having like six hours of battery life on a laptop back in those days was like amazing
[627.40 → 639.38] so that one i was like amazing so that's amazing so that's amazing so that's amazing so that one i bare bones built it so i bought my own CPU from Canada computers i bought some ram i bought a drive and then i bought a bare-bones unit from NCI and um
[639.38 → 657.24] i i i put it together and i realized that i had saved exactly zero dollars and that was when custom laptops died for me and the fact that they make them even less upgradable and customizable now doesn't cost the
[657.24 → 662.74] consumer any more money it just gets us better designs things like the razor blade uh the razor blade 14
[662.74 → 667.26] would not be possible if they were going to try and go oh well we also have to build on the ability to
[667.26 → 672.66] upgrade the graphics card gee how are we going to do that we can't uh things like ram and storage still
[672.66 → 677.98] really need to be upgradable and that's something that really irked me about the blade 14 the last
[677.98 → 683.98] edition that i covered but i think I've kind of gone off on a tangent here um
[683.98 → 692.70] dick move poor communication um also something that users are not uh understanding clearly enough
[692.70 → 699.42] is i see a lot of people saying oh well hey my GPU temps were great, so there was no concern it actually
[699.42 → 707.08] doesn't work that way there's that's one temperature for one component it has nothing to do with monitoring
[707.08 → 712.84] the health of the entire rest of the graphics card because even if it's integrated into another board
[712.84 → 719.70] and it's just like a cordoned off part of the PCB it's still a full graphics card with arm and memory
[719.70 → 725.56] modules and a GPU and all the other stuff that goes with that so if any of those other components
[725.56 → 731.22] were running out of spec and just plain weren't designed for it due to cost constraints or cooling
[731.22 → 736.66] constraints or whatever else the case may be it could meet an untimely death even if the GPU itself
[736.66 → 743.68] was fine and running at a frosty 60 degrees yeah so frosty that's pretty good for a graphics card
[743.68 → 753.28] but it's not frosty anyway my laugh right now is amazing that's all i have to say that was beautiful
[753.28 → 760.66] you have like the um that video that was going around um about the GTX 970 memory fiascoes with the
[760.66 → 766.22] guy that laughs oh yeah yeah like i can't even do that like the wheeze laugh i don't yeah
[766.22 → 775.26] i don't know how to do it yeah yeah oh my god yeah pretty good wheeze laugh going on their oh man
[775.26 → 780.90] that video was actually hilarious all right so that was posted in the forum by uh Kabul labarum
[780.90 → 785.88] yeah I've never seen that before all right we've got one of our one of our classic posters here this is
[785.88 → 793.42] it is official posted by goodbyes radio shack is closing down permanently files for bankruptcy
[793.42 → 801.76] uh, so our original article here is from the verge.com um oh i thought i had a touch screen i went to
[801.76 → 807.98] scroll the page i hate my life right okay my life isn't bad my life page down page up
[807.98 → 814.54] yeah i prefer function up down okay for that yeah I'm a big fan of that um anyway
[814.54 → 821.34] radio shack clearance low 20 50 off they don't know how many percent it is its everything
[821.34 → 829.22] yeah just everything's everything blows for them right now um so basically let's okay i thought
[829.22 → 834.60] that radio shack was already gone Canada yes okay because i was reading this article going like
[834.60 → 841.16] what circuit city acquired them acquired all the stores except i think maybe like a couple or
[841.16 → 846.78] something correct me if I'm wrong rebranded it into the source which I'm not sure if it has ever
[846.78 → 850.84] turned apart i mean Canadians out there love to hear from you guys in the twitch chat okay
[850.84 → 855.66] have you ever bought anything from the source i have gone to the source once i didn't buy anything
[855.66 → 862.14] there because they didn't have it was what was it CX had the exact same thing and at the source it
[862.14 → 869.12] was like 45 and at CX i think it was like three okay like a huge difference we have got some people
[869.12 → 875.08] in the twitch chat that are actually kind of bothering me because you guys are clearly new
[875.08 → 882.42] we got people saying radio shack sucks or sucked or whatever radio shack might suck now but radio
[882.42 → 891.12] shack was the it was the shit it was the shit awesome yeah like radio shack when i was young
[891.12 → 897.46] yeah i know oh no every story is going to be me being old today uh i was I'm old too than okay
[897.46 → 903.88] radio shack was awesome when we were younger like they were the one place you could go to find that
[903.88 → 909.86] weird stupid battery that fits in that weird stupid thing that you really need to get running now and
[909.86 → 915.96] they'd be open at 8 p.m like remote control toys and whatnot yeah like that was the place where if
[915.96 → 922.06] if radio shack still had their mojo that would be the place where you go to buy all like your DJI
[922.06 → 927.24] drones and like all that kind of cool stuff like they would have all the like the weird drone
[927.24 → 932.28] accessories for DIY repairing them and stuff like they used to have all that cool stuff like if you
[932.28 → 938.26] just had to buy like a shape ways shipping portal and like all like yeah they used to be really cool
[938.26 → 944.42] if radio shack hadn't forgotten who they were and started trying to be best buy and sell TVs and
[944.42 → 951.50] cell phones yeah like has anyone ever bought a cell phone at radio shack like why would
[951.50 → 957.92] you ever do this i don't understand and so okay, okay now we've got now we've got some people that are
[957.92 → 964.30] that are yeah radio yes radio shack did take a massive dump around the year 2000 this is true
[964.30 → 970.56] they did it's just that they used to be cool they see flying truck you cannot buy a resistor at
[970.56 → 976.90] Walmart just saying exactly it was the place you could go to buy a specific resistor or capacitor
[976.90 → 982.54] and they might actually have it, and then they stopped having that stuff and i stopped walking in the door
[982.54 → 988.42] and then the game was over for them at that point pretty much um i feel like in the last 15
[988.42 → 994.08] years they could have figured out how to go back, but they did not yeah and like radio shack used to have
[994.08 → 999.64] like pc games and stuff like it, they yeah and like uh they used to have like joysticks and like
[999.64 → 1006.42] stuff that like geeky dudes would like that was radio shack it wasn't a specific category, but it'd be
[1006.42 → 1013.32] like yeah i need some i need some like batteries car or a joystick or some weird battery or resistor or a
[1013.32 → 1019.00] game or i need like something cool to play with, or they'd have liked you know like back when those
[1019.00 → 1023.78] clocks that had like the things that went back and forth and the timing of the LEDs was just so that
[1023.78 → 1027.30] you could read a clock, and it looked like it was kind of hovering in midair like they just have like
[1027.30 → 1034.78] stupid cool crap and uh now they're dead so they're selling off 2400 of 4000 us stores
[1034.78 → 1041.48] uh rumours that sprint and standard general may pick some of them up uh so they'll live on apparently
[1041.48 → 1047.14] through a store and a store agreement with sprint and standard general so uh based on that sprint is
[1047.14 → 1052.26] one of the purchasing entities I'm guessing cell phones aren't coming off the menu at radio shack
[1052.26 → 1060.44] um, so radio shack had an overall deficit deficit deficit of 0.19 billion as of November 1st 2014
[1060.44 → 1067.92] and have failed to post a profit since 2011 so um someone in the there's a mini argument going on
[1067.92 → 1073.48] in twitch chat about whether Amazon is better they're not even the same at all they have nothing
[1073.48 → 1079.22] to do with each other yeah you can get resistors and stuff off Amazon but yeah like someone in the
[1079.22 → 1084.38] chat said you can't just drive there yeah you can't get it at 8 p.m yeah when like you have a
[1084.38 → 1090.10] school like okay here perfect example so like a school project let's say for example totally hypothetical
[1090.10 → 1098.66] you're making a wooden cutout dinosaur that has like uh one of those one of those mazes where it has like
[1098.66 → 1104.64] the wire thing maze, and then you want to build like a wand that you go and follow the maze with and then
[1104.64 → 1109.54] if you fail it completes a circuit and lights up the eyeball of the dinosaur let's say hypothetically
[1109.54 → 1115.28] you ever wanted to build something like that radio shack would probably be the place to go if you're
[1115.28 → 1121.26] like all of that for like all that stuff it's like i need a weird stupid light bulb that goes in
[1121.26 → 1126.34] the eye of a dinosaur yep radio shack and like the wand thing and the wire thing and everything and
[1126.34 → 1129.92] then just get the other stuff from a craft store or just make it out of wood or whatever
[1129.92 → 1137.00] all right so um so that that's pretty much it for that so sad day but then i was sad back when they
[1137.00 → 1142.28] died i was going to say it would have been a sad day if it was 15 years ago yeah um you oh this is
[1142.28 → 1147.34] interesting so AHM Ming posted this on the forum our original article here is from yahoo you got the uh
[1147.34 → 1152.24] link all right I'm going to go ahead and screen share with you guys i actually one thing that's nice about
[1152.24 → 1159.48] using this laptop is that i actually have a HDMI output now instead of relying on um a display port
[1159.48 → 1166.52] adapter so i think it should be more stable and more likely to work so for police body cameras big
[1166.52 → 1173.22] costs loom in storing the footage something that people that are tech-savvy are not going to be
[1173.22 → 1176.54] surprised by I'm sure a lot of our viewers are sitting there going why are you even talking about
[1176.54 → 1187.50] this duh duh duh but mainstream folks like the know government officials that are calling for this
[1187.50 → 1195.24] um are just kind of gonna kind of going to go oh well you know big bids must be easy no actually
[1195.24 → 1200.98] like a big really difficult problem if you've got thousands of videos like we're talking we're
[1200.98 → 1206.22] talking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours a week even thousands of hours a week you deploy
[1206.22 → 1210.86] these on you know okay so in dilute Minnesota you probably pronounced that wrong i don't care sorry
[1210.86 → 1218.60] to everyone from Minnesota um 110 officer worn cameras are generating 8 000 to 10 000 videos per
[1218.60 → 1225.40] month, and you got to store this stuff you can't store it forever for one thing okay so you got to
[1225.40 → 1231.58] store this stuff for at least some period of time so 30 30 days they're thinking 30 days but longer
[1231.58 → 1238.78] in many cases apparently in many cases longer because what if you got rid of something on day 30
[1238.78 → 1246.22] that someone sends in a complaint about on day 31 all of a sudden wait we need a system for
[1246.22 → 1253.88] oh we can only delete the stuff that um absolutely nothing happened, but we can't review all the footage
[1253.88 → 1259.72] at the time that it happens which oh hold on a second now we need an administrative system now we
[1259.72 → 1266.22] need some kind of software archival management thing like upload all of it to YouTube
[1266.22 → 1274.44] i had two plans one of them was upload all of it to YouTube if that doesn't work throw daily
[1274.44 → 1280.64] motion a bone they want some videos they'd be happy with 8 000 more videos a month throw them on daily
[1280.64 → 1288.42] motion the other one is maybe repurposed some NSA data centres I'm sure the American citizenry would be
[1288.42 → 1293.36] happy with that that's a big problem though because the municipalities are saying hey you guys are
[1293.36 → 1299.08] throwing the burden on us to pay thousands of dollars for these cameras which are nothing not
[1299.08 → 1304.34] even approaching the cost of running the program, but we're supposed to you know have these contracts
[1304.34 → 1309.48] and licensing agreements for data storage, and we're supposed to buy these cameras we're supposed to
[1309.48 → 1314.96] train our officers on how to use them and how to not you know obstruct them so that something they
[1314.96 → 1318.76] let's say an officer did something inadvertently where they covered it up and all of a sudden
[1318.76 → 1324.50] they're you know the latest you know plastered all over signs and everywhere because they did
[1324.50 → 1329.68] whatever you got to train the officers on how to use these they're police officers not like camera
[1329.68 → 1335.50] operators um and the municipalities are going well hold on a second you guys are telling us we have to do
[1335.50 → 1341.14] this where's this money coming from like is it coming out of the know military budget where
[1341.14 → 1346.72] they're buying tanks and planes and whatever crap they're buying like do we get some of that money
[1346.72 → 1351.98] no so it just comes out of it just comes out of our budget so are we supposed to are we supposed to
[1351.98 → 1357.62] lay off police officers so that we can big brother the rest of the police officers and I'm not saying
[1357.62 → 1365.14] to be clear i am not saying that law enforcement officials do not need to be held accountable for
[1365.14 → 1370.44] what they're doing needs to be a better properly laid out plan, so this can actually work or an actual plan
[1370.44 → 1375.16] yes yeah a plan because they just said you have to do it they didn't really give any information
[1375.16 → 1382.28] about how or anything did they so um sergeant Jason Halifax actually has a great quote everyone is
[1382.28 → 1387.34] screaming we need body cameras but no one is saying where is the money coming from what are you going to
[1387.34 → 1392.06] do with all the data who is going to manage it are we going to cut personnel are we going to increase
[1392.06 → 1400.26] taxes great point sergeant Halifax i agree completely so that's basically just it's its
[1400.26 → 1404.92] another one of those they just give every officer their own YouTube channel their own private YouTube
[1404.92 → 1411.04] channel it's another one of those things where it's like seriously though it's like this harebrained
[1411.04 → 1417.60] scheme that someone well-intentioned comes up with like uh what was it being it Toronto where they banned
[1417.60 → 1424.18] plastic shopping bags, and then it turned out that the waste from all the paper shopping bags
[1424.18 → 1430.94] that replaced them ended up being much more harmful to the environment and also just less easy to use
[1430.94 → 1439.06] and like all these other problems um yeah it's like we gotta or or or the whole um crap i forget
[1439.06 → 1444.66] what it is, but there's some there's some food like it's a vegan or vegetarian like it's a popular food
[1444.66 → 1451.70] that's actually more environmentally harmful to produce than beef what and the argument for i can't, I can't
[1451.70 → 1455.62] remember what it is exactly, but it's a lot of these well-intentioned things that in practice
[1455.62 → 1459.80] actually just don't make an ounce of sense at least not yet and not without a proper plan i think this
[1459.80 → 1464.72] do they just need to figure out their data storage makes a ton of sense because the amount of like you
[1464.72 → 1471.42] look at how bloated the legal system is now to get anything done cameras are an excellent
[1471.42 → 1475.88] solution and then the funny thing is though it's its always it's always it's always hilarious because as
[1475.88 → 1479.86] soon as law enforcement tries to use cameras to back up any claim they make against
[1479.86 → 1485.22] the civilian or whoever it is that they're trying to enforce the law against it's probably the same
[1485.22 → 1490.22] group of people getting butt hurt about traffic cameras as the people who are calling for the
[1490.22 → 1495.22] cops to have cameras monitoring what they're doing you understand like i hope people understand what
[1495.22 → 1503.16] they're asking for here you are asking for your complaint about the police officer to be basically
[1503.16 → 1507.56] thrown out immediately because it's like yeah we got a camera there's no debate to be had here
[1507.56 → 1514.74] but the good news about all of this is that the savings is going to come about eventually I'm not
[1514.74 → 1518.52] going to get into politics, but those are two very different conversations that you just tried to
[1518.52 → 1524.24] merge into one they are okay like very different because you're talking about you can debate observing
[1524.24 → 1529.54] people who are currently employed to be administering other people no you're talking about observing the
[1529.54 → 1535.60] people that they're observing but as well your main action that you're observing is the officer it is
[1535.60 → 1541.58] but it's also the other one stationary cameras a very different situation it's both and the yeah
[1541.58 → 1546.94] it's both I'm just saying that the people who are upset about being filmed yes but the traffic
[1546.94 → 1553.66] cameras thing is traffic cameras the whole automated thing okay most of the argument against traffic
[1553.66 → 1559.04] cameras that i think really holds water is that they're an outright money grabber they have nothing
[1559.04 → 1563.98] to do with safety they have nothing to do with upholding the law they have to do with planting them in
[1563.98 → 1569.64] places where for nothing for the cost of a van sitting next to the road or in some cases now it's gotten
[1569.64 → 1574.74] even less expensive back when they implemented in bc before they got rid of the whole photo radar van
[1574.74 → 1579.88] thing they were stationed in vans um i don't know if I've ever told this story on the
[1579.88 → 1586.84] wan show before but i knew someone who knew someone who uh who had just an utterly epic story about photo
[1586.84 → 1591.62] radar, so all photo radar vans were these white vans they were these white windowless vans and they
[1591.62 → 1596.30] would park on the side of the road and then basically it was autopilot there was an officer
[1596.30 → 1600.46] sitting in there, but they didn't have to do anything because it would just mail you uh it would mail you a
[1600.46 → 1607.28] violation notice in the month a month later or whatever um so one of the cops who was off duty
[1607.28 → 1616.42] arranged not sure how to borrow another photo radar van because he knew that one of his colleagues would
[1616.42 → 1622.56] just sleep in the van so what he did was he waited until that colleague was on photo radar duty
[1622.56 → 1633.18] borrowed another van drove up made sure he was sleeping swapped the plates on the two vans and then spent the
[1633.18 → 1639.08] next couple hours speeding past his own trap repeatedly
[1639.08 → 1646.94] so while that officer was on duty there was like a couple dozen speeding violations
[1646.94 → 1650.42] for the van that he was supposed to be driving
[1650.42 → 1659.42] that's actually so awesome that is it was like it's like the most amazing troll that i think i have
[1659.42 → 1664.50] ever heard of that's great it's fantastic yeah i know there's again i don't think we should talk
[1664.50 → 1669.62] about politics too much, but there's there are things with like the uh public should not be
[1669.62 → 1675.22] automatically assumed guilty and therefore not observed blah blah blah i don't know it's a very
[1675.22 → 1679.50] deep conversation the thing about the photo radar though is that there is no assumption the radar is
[1679.50 → 1685.72] first the photo comes later so there's so anyway so the whole thing is that
[1685.72 → 1692.58] the police officers are being monitored it's a difficult it questions that they didn't expect yes pretty much
[1692.58 → 1699.08] and everyone's being more monitored and that's what's happening I'm just I'm just interested in
[1699.08 → 1703.04] how they're going to deal with it right now they have their contracting agreement yeah so they have
[1703.04 → 1710.26] a three-year contracting agreement for 78 grand for the storing i think that was what uh 110 officers
[1710.26 → 1717.58] 84 cameras yeah this was Duluth Minnesota yeah um like i think they need to localize that a little bit
[1717.58 → 1726.30] i think that might be better yeah i don't I don't know i don't I don't know or honestly i wasn't I
[1726.30 → 1731.36] was being a little bit joking I'm sorry about YouTube but seriously a private account that isn't
[1731.36 → 1739.48] uploading the videos to the public that is like that is like a terrible stupid solution that might
[1739.48 → 1746.82] actually work like but but i mean the the the agreement you'd have to enter into with YouTube
[1746.82 → 1751.82] about you know who that footage belongs to and privacy and all that like if it's completely
[1751.82 → 1760.08] untenable completely untenable, but it's just all right it would work if you weren't like actually
[1760.08 → 1767.38] the police posted by nine shadow uh this original source here is global.samsungtomorrow.com
[1767.38 → 1776.08] Samsung has updated their um uh their EULA to basically say look we are not monitoring your
[1776.08 → 1784.58] living room conversations uh because no one believed ever hopefully um like look we're the only thing
[1784.58 → 1790.54] we're listening to is voice commands uh because there was kind of a sketch looking a sketch looking
[1790.54 → 1797.02] warning about not talking about personal information in front of Samsung smart TVs um their privacy policy
[1797.02 → 1802.06] was updated warning users they shouldn't talk about sensitive information and then now it's saying
[1802.06 → 1808.38] whoa hold on a second um yes you know information could be among data captured transmitted to a third
[1808.38 → 1813.52] party but hold on blah blah blah uh they take our users' information privacy very seriously users can
[1813.52 → 1819.82] opt out of voice recognition whenever they please um no longer mentions any sensitive information
[1819.82 → 1823.04] reiterates that users can disable voice recognition whenever they please so
[1823.04 → 1830.10] i suspect actually nothing has changed it's just yeah it's just an EULA reversion defining it differently or whatever
[1830.10 → 1835.14] this one's pretty good though this was posted by Victoria's secret and there's a great Reddit thread
[1835.14 → 1839.78] there's always a great Reddit thread for just about anything isn't there um where someone posts
[1839.78 → 1846.20] well hold on a second Plex stopped playing my video halfway through and played a Pepsi ad
[1846.20 → 1854.66] um, so this was posted by uh beans 90 and there's a 34 point upvote comment that says yep just googled
[1854.66 → 1859.44] this to find out what's going on never had this in the two months I've been using Plex but today all of a
[1859.44 → 1865.90] sudden it began I'm glad I'm not the only one every movie i play 20 to 30 minutes in plays this Pepsi ad
[1865.90 → 1874.10] no audio but crisp clear ad it has happened on six movies today oh yes uh mine is a Samsung TV also
[1874.10 → 1881.54] six movies today this guy's going ham who watches six movies what is he watching sorry completely
[1881.54 → 1888.50] unrelated i just that blew my mind a little bit this is crazy so now to be clear Plex has already
[1888.50 → 1896.66] said whoa whoa whoa whoa not use uh actually we have nothing to do with this and um this is not the
[1896.66 → 1903.64] only application that users are experienced have experienced this in uh so native smart TV apps uh so
[1903.64 → 1911.44] the Foxtel TV service app in Australia is experiencing the same commercials, so there's a Foxtel employee that
[1911.44 → 1917.38] was quoted as saying this absolutely should not be happening and is being escalated immediately
[1917.38 → 1922.12] uh there's no word from Samsung as of February 11th when the article was posted, but it is
[1922.12 → 1926.68] speculated that it may be a new ad insertion platform that may have been accidentally turned
[1926.68 → 1936.76] on by default in certain apps, although none of this has been confirmed wow yeah i haven't at no point
[1936.76 → 1942.48] in time have I ever wanted a smart TV i can't think of a reason that i would need it to exist although
[1942.48 → 1953.60] um crap i feel like a terrible person i think it's Sony is using android TV for all of their
[1953.60 → 1960.00] yeah TVs yeah like instead of the stupid like phenomenally stupid proprietary ones but like i
[1960.00 → 1967.44] just i want a good dumb TV and then i just want to plug uh Chromecast into it yeah that's all i want
[1967.44 → 1973.50] dumb TVs don't even exist anymore i mean every single TV is a smart TV now i know so get wrecked i
[1973.50 → 1983.82] know yeah well wait what are those uh what's that cheap Korean brand uh Samsung no, no that's the
[1983.82 → 1989.44] expensive Korean brand sorry no they uh crap they came up with like the really affordable 4k stuff really
[1989.44 → 1997.96] early um oh some it starts with an s those are all not smart right yeah i don't think they are
[1997.96 → 2004.68] seiki seiko something Seiko's watches oh i think it is seiki sure along those lines
[2004.68 → 2012.72] i don't think those are smart TVs okay oh man talking is hard now people saying Vizio i don't think
[2012.72 → 2020.50] Vizio is a Korean brand i don't know what Vizio is um all right, so basically this is a big
[2020.50 → 2026.80] load of crap um so Samsung there's nothing else even really to say this is just stupid we're on the
[2026.80 → 2033.84] record as this is a completely ginormous load of crap like i literally bought a piece of hardware
[2033.84 → 2044.32] from you, and you actually don't get to serve me ads on it mind you i mean okay if we if we break
[2044.32 → 2051.44] this down a little bit is it different from buying a laptop with a trial of Norton on it that is an ad
[2051.44 → 2060.46] at least you know that's coming well maybe they put it on the box now with 30 more ad gen, but it's not
[2060.46 → 2066.16] right but what if they did would you feel any better about it no but i wouldn't buy that TV
[2066.16 → 2075.06] what if they all did it then i wouldn't buy a TV you already don't buy a TV okay well, so the point is
[2075.06 → 2081.10] we strongly disagree with this and i think we may just might as well move on because it's not like
[2081.10 → 2089.26] you and i are going to debate this point um so I'm the sketchiest thing ever
[2089.26 → 2096.02] oh, oh are we moving on to that this is a sketchy weird article this is like this is like a horrible
[2096.02 → 2103.54] horrible list of maybes i don't know um so FCC commissioner says uh this was posted by
[2103.54 → 2113.08] command man 7 um the article that we've got here is breakbart.com and uh there's a there's an autoplay
[2113.08 → 2118.68] oops there's an autoplay video here that i would really like to no i guess it doesn't really matter
[2118.68 → 2127.00] because i have my audio muted so here we go here's a picture of one of the two one of the two
[2127.00 → 2133.18] republican FCC commissioners with president Obama's 332-page plan to regulate the internet
[2133.18 → 2141.42] that is very strong wording designed to insight upset i wish the public could see what's inside
[2141.42 → 2149.88] it's got about 4500 retweets um so inferred in a tweet that the document is basically a scheme for
[2149.88 → 2155.54] federal micromanaging of the internet to extract billions in new taxes from consumers um
[2155.54 → 2165.90] and i guess the only thing i really have to say about this article and then the fantastic one high
[2165.90 → 2173.96] taxes heavy-handed controls and the status quo uh linked at the bottom here is that the amount of
[2173.96 → 2181.52] the okay i think i don't know if we want to use this site as a reference any more uh because it
[2181.52 → 2189.00] looks like the folks that are relying on these articles for their information have some
[2189.00 → 2196.42] information to gain about the internet and stuff the comments under this second article in particular
[2196.42 → 2207.40] are fantastic like about how the know title two is going to basically all that stuff that you know
[2207.40 → 2214.58] gets written by executives at telecoms and then signed by government officials who are in their pocket
[2214.58 → 2220.94] it's like parroting of that it's fantastic i love it i thought we were streaming this I'm kind of
[2220.94 → 2225.90] happy we're not no we're not streaming it because basically it's a lot of terrible i was like
[2225.90 → 2232.70] pretty sure what they were and i was like why are we showing this so um president Obama's plan marks a
[2232.70 → 2239.06] monumental shift between i think i already said that the plan saddles small independent businesses
[2239.06 → 2244.46] and entrepreneurs with heavy-handed regulations that will push them out of the market something okay
[2244.46 → 2250.20] something i don't like about any of this is here's the thing you can't read, and you can't know what's
[2250.20 → 2255.18] in it except here's what's in it, i have a feeling all this stuff that they're telling us might not
[2255.18 → 2260.76] even be right um okay I'm not agreeing with or disagreeing with it just we would need to be able
[2260.76 → 2267.78] to see what's in it this is no accident title two was designed to regulate a monopoly if we impose
[2267.78 → 2275.36] that model on a vibrant broadband marketplace i guess if we did impose it on a vibrant broadband
[2275.36 → 2281.42] marketplace this might be applicable um a highly regulated monopoly is what we'll get now that's
[2281.42 → 2287.22] what we have right now to be clear they have right now that is a that is a that is a valid point other
[2287.22 → 2292.60] than the vibrant marketplace bit the whole bit about regulated monopolies not really being great either
[2292.60 → 2298.86] because that's that's basically what we've got on the telco side as it is so title two remember the thing
[2298.86 → 2306.60] that we're all sort of going hurrah about is reclassifying the internet with under title two as um
[2306.60 → 2314.36] as a utility which honestly hasn't worked out that great for us on the phone up till now either
[2314.36 → 2323.60] because you still have no choice yay um so that is a valid point but the part where this really
[2323.60 → 2330.76] misses the mark is calling the vibrant broadband marketplace vibrant and a marketplace because it's
[2330.76 → 2337.92] not if it is horrible it's even more horrible than a regulated monopoly, so this is it perfect now is it a
[2337.92 → 2341.78] step in the right direction yes is treating it as anything other than a step in the right direction
[2341.78 → 2350.46] just and nonsense and to reiterate we have no idea what this thing says yeah that's a big problem we
[2350.46 → 2358.14] have no clue I'm not i can't agree or disagree with it because what the hell is inside well i can disagree
[2358.14 → 2363.42] with the way it's being spun yes tells me what i sort of gives me it gives me some idea what the
[2363.42 → 2371.62] credibility is here if we're gonna call if we're going to call telcos a vibrant broadband marketplace
[2371.62 → 2376.14] then we're wrong we have no idea what's going on we were wrong before we opened our mouths and
[2376.14 → 2380.30] that's unfortunate all right so let's move on to more unfortunate news sup
[2380.30 → 2386.56] sorry oh yeah yeah yeah he's telling me to do sponsors it's okay we'll do sponsors in a bit
[2386.56 → 2392.52] uh this one is pretty good this was posted by cat butts i actually didn't mean to whisper that as
[2392.52 → 2398.64] hardcore as i did it just wasn't good um also cat butts is awesome he has a YouTube channel that i used
[2398.64 → 2403.60] to watch before i started working with you and i was a member of our forum and stuff yeah oh cool
[2403.60 → 2410.02] yeah um who else were we supposed to do a shout-out for today oh right yeah shout out for paul Paul's
[2410.02 → 2418.82] hardware YouTube.com Paul's hardware uh let's just go ahead and screen share this uh so Paul is doing a
[2418.82 → 2425.56] giveaway um look at him with his blatant advertising his how to build a computer video that is clearly
[2425.56 → 2430.38] inferior to our how to build a computer video uh this is the silent build giveaway so it's like a
[2430.38 → 2440.54] 4770k and uh some card with a GTX and uh some eight gigs of ram and some pretty cool stuff and i you
[2440.54 → 2444.12] probably have to be subscribed or something which is unfortunate because look at this guy
[2444.12 → 2448.02] and the t-shirt he wears wow he wears his shirt with himself on it what a nerd
[2448.02 → 2458.14] i wear that shirt too yeah it also has you on i know okay so as long as we've understood
[2458.14 → 2464.82] as long as we've understood these the layers of irony here it's 100 collateral damaged myself
[2464.82 → 2471.74] that would be a great name for a band 100 percent collateral damage
[2471.74 → 2480.14] you like to have to smash your whole set every show no matter what I'm adding that to our intro slogans
[2480.14 → 2486.72] there's a doc i should get you added on it, we're just going to like continue adding to it for the mayo one
[2486.72 → 2492.40] it's going to be like Luke is sick or something i saw a couple of great ones on the uh on the forum
[2492.40 → 2496.20] thread where someone was complaining i saw you responded to it already where someone was
[2496.20 → 2501.36] complaining about um do as we say not as we do being under our logo saying it was unprofessional
[2501.36 → 2505.76] and i was like people came up with a couple other ones that make us sound like idiots i was like oh
[2505.76 → 2513.48] these are great these are comedy gold I'm putting these in the thread that's awesome um so intro oh
[2513.48 → 2523.74] oh bloody hell uh intro 100 collateral damage yeah you actually have the voice for it right now
[2523.74 → 2532.68] too bad i can't sing at all i that's fine i think for that style all right so um our source here is the
[2532.68 → 2540.64] jays two cents fora so we've got a post from this guy uh oh so is this like worse than CCF tech or
[2540.64 → 2547.16] i i i don't I don't know uh but basically jay's saying I've had some discussions with people this
[2547.16 → 2553.88] has been this has been all over the place so we're going to treat this whole thing as basically
[2553.88 → 2561.50] none of this information is confirmed it is all hearsay, but basically a post showed up on overclocked
[2561.50 → 2568.36] net where someone was saying i am a former employee the owner has suffered has struggled with addiction
[2568.36 → 2573.70] or something along those lines and there is no reason to believe that frozen CPU will be back
[2573.70 → 2580.98] up and running there has been damage to the premises um and then sort of there's nothing on the site
[2580.98 → 2587.50] to this day there's nothing on the frozen cpu.com website um and then other people have allegedly
[2587.50 → 2598.28] posted here i have pictures of the alleged damage inside the frozen CPU headquarters, so there's like
[2598.28 → 2607.52] parts of the office look pretty trashed um so i like that picture this is like oh okay here's
[2607.52 → 2613.64] this broken thing here's some like here's a beer bottle and all that kind of stuff um
[2613.64 → 2622.20] and so someone from a water cooling manufacturer said yes this is confirmed in the thread then the
[2622.20 → 2627.10] owner of the aforementioned water cooling manufacturer went in and said whoa hold on a second we cannot
[2627.10 → 2635.68] speak for frozen CPU none of this is confirmed um i actually I've exchanged emails with but never met
[2635.68 → 2644.38] the owner mark from frozen CPU um i do know Matthew Buckner from frozen CPU but honestly i just out of
[2644.38 → 2651.28] sheer respect for the quantity of emails that they're probably dealing with i have not emailed either of
[2651.28 → 2657.14] them i probably will at some point here but i have not emailed either of them to ask what's going on
[2657.14 → 2667.52] um yeah it's really unfortunate and like something's got to be going on if there isn't an official post
[2667.52 → 2674.86] somewhere, so the site is still online uh so okay rumours have it that frozen CPU has said that they
[2674.86 → 2681.92] are running on a skeleton crew, and they'll be back up and running um the ex-employee said something
[2681.92 → 2685.78] like physical damage to the warehouse has occurred as well as dismissal of all support and warehouse
[2685.78 → 2692.76] staff the site is still online still accepting orders so we're going to take a wait and see approach
[2692.76 → 2698.04] with this one yeah that's pretty much all of them speaking of things that we'll need to wait and see
[2698.04 → 2705.78] about this was posted by ah Ming on the forum and this is the new cutting edge my friends if you were
[2705.78 → 2715.12] running network cables that were not audio quest diamond RJ slash e whatever that is Ethernet cables
[2715.12 → 2721.88] before then you were completely doing it wrong, and you need to get your life back in gear because this
[2721.88 → 2728.02] is the new standard these network cables are made of here hold on a second I'm going to bring up the uh
[2728.02 → 2737.32] I'm going to bring up the dang it Windows 8 all right they represent a lifetime's research
[2737.32 → 2742.82] and are the first and so the first you know twisted pair of Ethernet standard just to be clear
[2742.82 → 2749.76] 10 base t was published in 1990, so the relevant engineers are must be 25 years old max um these are
[2749.76 → 2756.00] directional Ethernet cables i mean you wouldn't want bidirectional communication you know um
[2756.00 → 2763.98] discombobulating the waveforms and the beating heart of the audio quest diamond are the solid 100
[2763.98 → 2771.50] percent silver perfect surface conductors where raw silver as opposed to cooked silver raw
[2771.50 → 2778.06] silver is processed by drawing through at a much slower speed than normal to create an ultra smooth
[2778.06 → 2786.10] surface area surface free of indents and grooves because the way that we all know i mean we all know
[2786.10 → 2791.30] i hope we know do you know that the way that it works is the electrons are like hurdle jumpers okay
[2791.30 → 2798.40] they're like curling rocks in a race in a race okay if an electron you know travelling along a wire
[2798.40 → 2804.84] hits a hurdle all of a sudden that electron is going to arrive out of phase with the rest of the
[2804.84 → 2811.20] electrons and think about it this way that's how DDoS works did you know that the earth if shrunk down
[2811.20 → 2817.80] to the size of a pool ball if it was shrunk down it would actually be smoother than an actual pool ball
[2817.80 → 2824.46] did you know that that's actually that's actually a fact um and so these tiny wires for these
[2824.46 → 2831.36] tiny electrons to not hit a hurdle need to be completely smooth, and the silver surface is reflective
[2831.36 → 2837.22] which aids their travel it's also an antibacterial agent it's also an antibacterial that actually is
[2837.22 → 2841.82] true but has nothing to do with Ethernet um none of what i know none of this none of this had anything
[2841.82 → 2848.22] to do with that so these are ten thousand dollar i think that conversion may have been done
[2848.22 → 2854.64] incorrectly maybe it's like ten thousand Canadian rupees um so forty-seven hundred Great Britain pound
[2854.64 → 2862.98] eight meter Ethernet cables for idiots um they have a five-year warranty um they are supposedly
[2862.98 → 2870.70] audio quest brand which i guess stupid like ridiculous junk we'll just throw audio file on it, i guess it
[2870.70 → 2877.72] like if you're streaming if you're streaming from you know a NAS music files then you want those
[2877.72 → 2885.04] electrons to not get hurdle blocked um so what so I'm just going to read the blurb because
[2885.04 → 2890.18] it's hilarious the diamond is a top grade Ethernet cable which is the result of a lifetime's research
[2890.18 → 2895.66] by audio quest made from the very best materials available this really is money is no object cable
[2895.66 → 2902.78] for the dedicated hi-fi enthusiast that has extended into a world of digital audio sources by extending
[2902.78 → 2908.58] the thought process of quality cabling from a server pc or media streamer to the router
[2908.58 → 2916.28] extending the thought process from a server to a router further detail can be realized and restrictive
[2916.28 → 2923.28] shackles loosened audio quest's diamond rue is a directional Ethernet cable made with the same hallmark
[2923.28 → 2929.28] materials philosophy care and attention that is applied to all their internet connects whether it's an entry level
[2929.28 → 2936.64] introduction to hi-fi or a dyed in the wool music connoisseur and i think they got dyed wrong
[2936.64 → 2944.00] yeah it's a very different dyed in the wool what does that mean another upgrade is the complete plug
[2944.00 → 2947.54] redesign you don't get to redesign the rj45 connector
[2947.54 → 2955.64] made from silver with tabs that are virtually unbreakable the plug comes with added strain relief
[2955.64 → 2963.00] and firmly lock into place ensuring no critical data is lost critical data am I listening to music or is it critical data
[2963.00 → 2967.48] all audio cables are directional
[2969.48 → 2976.20] the correct direction is determined by listening to every batch of metal conductors used in every audio quest audio cable are you serious
[2976.20 → 2984.84] arrows are clearly marked on the connectors to ensure superior sound quality for best results have the arrow pointing in the direction of the flow of music
[2987.00 → 2990.04] so for best results so you don't even have to really
[2991.00 → 3002.84] all insulation slows down the signal on the conductor inside man that sentence when insulation is unbiased it slows down parts of the signal differently
[3002.84 → 3008.20] a big problem for time sensitive multi-octave audio
[3008.20 → 3016.44] you should be able to get sued for this stuff
[3016.44 → 3020.36] wow
[3020.36 → 3026.20] i hadn't actually read the product page yet
[3026.20 → 3029.08] i hadn't finished i hadn't gotten to that part
[3029.08 → 3034.04] that was fun i didn't either i read this and was like oh it's another one of those things
[3034.04 → 3040.44] that was really fun like you know monster cables okay sometimes you can get monster cables on promo
[3040.44 → 3046.04] for like twice as much as a cheapo cable and i would argue for buying them at that point because they
[3046.04 → 3051.64] are going to tend to have like better strain relief connectors and nice sleeving they might have sleeving on them
[3051.64 → 3057.80] and sleeping on HDMI cables which you have to run potentially through like wooden cut holes and stuff
[3057.80 → 3062.68] can actually be helpful can actually be nice we're talking physical damage to the cable a longer HDMI
[3062.68 → 3067.56] connectors with a better quality connector thicker gauge wire it may make a difference it may be the difference
[3067.56 → 3072.60] between it works at all or doesn't work at all which by the way for digital is the only standard it works or
[3072.60 → 3078.92] it doesn't work for a video cable um so i okay you know what I'm done i don't want to talk about it
[3078.92 → 3086.20] anymore that was just their BS that was fun but i need to i need to move on with my life um so speaking
[3086.20 → 3091.56] of moving on with my life lynda.com is the way to move on with your life how do you like that actually
[3091.56 → 3096.68] that's actually a perfect segue yeah definitely could be i have good segues probably has been for a lot
[3096.68 → 3105.08] of people i i i have good segues every once in a month week here in time um so lynda.com is oh you
[3105.08 → 3111.80] know what okay, okay hold on I'm going to use my notes this week because wow nick the level
[3111.80 → 3118.12] the amount of butt hurt that went on over last week when i forgot the sponsor spot was pretty
[3118.12 → 3124.68] intense so lynda.com is used by millions of people around the world they have more than 3 000 courses
[3124.68 → 3131.32] available they have topics like web development photography visual design and business they also
[3131.32 → 3137.16] have software training like excel WordPress and photoshop all courses are taught see this is way
[3137.16 → 3141.96] worse than the way that i do it lynda.com is cool because you learn cool stuff, and you can either you
[3141.96 → 3146.76] know get better at your hobby or get better at your job or learn a new job and really take investing in
[3146.76 → 3153.16] yourself to the next level their subscriptions start at 25 a month i tried to look up knowledge is sexy
[3153.16 → 3157.32] so i could hold up an image of it and i got not what i was looking for no you didn't
[3158.44 → 3164.36] at all um so lynda.com subscription started only 25 a month, and you can learn at your own pace
[3164.36 → 3169.56] according to whatever appetite you have so they have a 10-day free trial which gives you unlimited
[3169.56 → 3175.56] access to every course on lynda.com so you can find out if it's right for you before you go ahead
[3175.56 → 3182.28] and commit to it our next sponsor today is Dollar Shave Club and this one is pretty straightforward
[3182.28 → 3188.84] do you like shaving do you like it when people you know shave then you could buy a Dollar Shave Club
[3188.84 → 3194.52] club membership for yourself or someone else you know who you think should shave, and we used to
[3194.52 → 3199.72] actually have nick we used to have Dollar Shave Club stuff to like to hold up while we did these spots
[3199.72 → 3205.56] but all of it got taken because Dollar Shave Club razors are actually they're well they're they're
[3205.56 → 3210.92] pretty great they're they're great we have no problems with them, they're what else can we really
[3210.92 → 3215.64] say about it, you should probably re-up my subscription you probably should, I've been using the same
[3215.64 → 3225.80] blade for like two months i think why do you have to do everything wrong I'll tell you what tell you
[3225.80 → 3231.24] what i will, I'll buy you a Dollar Shave Club subscription okay because it's important you're
[3231.24 → 3238.12] gonna you're going to like hurt your skin with like dull razors it's bad it's bad anyway for only a few
[3238.12 → 3243.24] dollars a month Dollar Shave Club saves you the hassle of going to the department store or wherever
[3243.24 → 3249.08] they keep all the razor blades under lock and key nearby you if you happen to be too lazy to buy
[3249.08 → 3254.28] razors then having the monthly subscription makes sure that you're using a fresh blade every week and
[3254.28 → 3259.72] getting the best shave possible so you can look like a well-groomed human being without ever having
[3259.72 → 3263.88] to actually step outside the house, and you can save a few bucks while you're at it, i think the best thing
[3263.88 → 3270.36] about Dollar Shave Club for me is that the countries that they exist in so Canada Australia New Zealand
[3270.36 → 3276.68] and the US funny story about the New Zealand thing by the way um they price things reasonably they
[3276.68 → 3283.64] don't just go oh arbitrary it costs three times as much tax because you're from Canada i love that
[3283.64 → 3288.68] companies that are like look we have a margin target this is how much dollars are so much worse this is how
[3288.68 → 3295.00] much our product costs us and this is how we're going to do it love that that's a high integrity
[3295.00 → 3301.16] way of doing business so the New Zealand story um i called out in a Dollar Shave Club sponsor spot
[3301.16 → 3307.48] on Linus tech tips that they're available in Canada us and New Zealand nick span because
[3308.76 → 3315.48] we had they didn't say that they were in New Zealand and like freaked out and was like to dog
[3315.48 → 3319.96] what's going on, and he like sent an apologetic email to Dollar Shave Club, and they're just like
[3319.96 → 3327.00] how did you know that yeah we just rolled it out and Nick's like yeah we're paying really close
[3327.00 → 3333.08] attention okay, and he asked me about it and I'm like yeah no i straight up screwed it up i i i screwed
[3333.08 → 3338.36] up i thought Australia and New Zealand telepathically connected i knew it was I knew it was somewhere in
[3338.36 → 3343.56] that i knew it was somewhere in the waves gives you a mental connection oh yeah they don't just have razors
[3343.56 → 3347.96] they also have butt wipes for men they have aftershave they have their shave butter all kinds
[3347.96 → 3355.96] of good stuff so okay, okay i think we should move on to this is new yeah this is very new uh nick you
[3355.96 → 3360.44] can go whatever you have to say isn't going to be nice to me, i wanted to say thank you for sticking
[3360.44 → 3369.32] to the script, and also you're the worst you know how it is love you buddy um look my mountain kind of
[3369.32 → 3377.32] goes with the logo, so this is a product that we have been using very extensively over the last couple
[3377.32 → 3387.16] of years and XSplit has actually launched a new version of XSplit v2 that uh actually i mean we didn't
[3387.16 → 3391.40] really have any complaints about XSplit for a long time like in the early days once we figured out how
[3391.40 → 3396.68] to use it mostly well they did have some issues too it didn't use to be a hundred percent so we've been
[3396.68 → 3403.72] streaming the LAN show on XSplit since the very first LAN show i believe yeah since before
[3403.72 → 3408.68] the LAN show was the LAN show we've been using XSplit we really like the software it's stable it's
[3408.68 → 3414.44] feature reasonably rich there are still a couple of things that i might want to ask for but for game streamers
[3414.44 → 3420.44] or for like prosumer grade broadcasters like us, you've got a ton of options being able to stream
[3420.44 → 3426.12] at any resolution having it be easy enough to configure in only a couple of minutes and being extremely
[3426.12 → 3431.64] affordable makes XSplit definitely our platform of choice which we don't have to we don't have to
[3431.64 → 3435.72] like say it's our platform of choice because we just switched to using it because they sponsored us
[3435.72 → 3441.48] no we've been using it for a long time you can learn like video editing and like video management stuff
[3441.48 → 3447.32] from Linda make yourself look better with Dollar Shave Club and then stream to the world with XSplit yeah
[3447.32 → 3453.16] it all goes together really well like that so XSplit v2 uh they have some notes for me to kind of
[3453.16 → 3457.08] call out because we've been using it for a little bit here, but it has powerful new production tools
[3457.08 → 3463.16] built to meet the needs of today's content creators um makes audio video it has an audio video mixing
[3463.16 → 3468.20] application that allows anyone to create professional quality live broadcast and video recordings
[3468.20 → 3473.16] like what we're doing right now it supports all kinds of different okay I'm just okay I'm abandoning
[3473.16 → 3477.48] their notes because i like my way better uh it supports all kinds of different broadcasting modes so you
[3477.48 → 3482.68] can broadcast at different frame rates and different resolutions you can broadcast at different bit rates
[3482.68 → 3487.24] according to what's going to work out best for you and the service that you happen to be broadcasting
[3487.24 → 3494.28] on its fantastic it has, so many more options compared to free stuff like NVIDIA's shadow to play
[3494.28 → 3500.12] that for many game streamers it's sort of competing against but in my mind it's not really a competition
[3500.12 → 3505.00] if you're trying to have a professional looking stream because the options are extremely limited and
[3505.00 → 3510.52] XSplit gives us the ability to do all kinds of stuff like bring in uh bring in video callers very easily
[3510.52 → 3516.20] uh capture portions of the screen and mix and match them and switch them around and have like
[3516.20 → 3523.00] transitions that's all automatic we don't actually do that stuff um what else am I talking about oh
[3523.00 → 3527.00] yeah I'm supposed to talk about gamecaster is one i haven't used as much just because we have
[3527.00 → 3530.92] the full broadcaster, but it's great for gamers that are looking to get started you can easily stream and
[3530.92 → 3535.40] record your greatest gaming moments can broadcast to live-streaming services such as YouTube live twitch you
[3535.40 → 3544.20] stream and more and the best thing is that XSplit the free license is you guessed it free so visit
[3544.20 → 3550.84] xsplit.com slash Linus to try it out the paid license the one we have allows like more scenes and higher quality audio
[3551.40 → 3556.04] and uh probably a number of other things, but those are the big ones for us that are why we go with uh with the
[3556.04 → 3560.36] professional license so we can have like all these different lower thirds so thanks to XSplit
[3560.36 → 3565.80] Dollar Shave Club lynda.com and Linus tech tips for powering the wan show today
[3566.76 → 3572.44] all right let's go ahead and uh move into our next topic here which is awesome what's our next topic
[3572.44 → 3578.20] you go ahead the drones in France oh i love this thing my voice is like super done yeah it's super
[3578.20 → 3587.32] super i need water um nick i don't know if he's going to hear you anyway i posted it in the twitch chat
[3587.32 → 3592.20] no one's going to you, I'm still trying to find it i want to play that video there have been people
[3592.20 → 3597.16] that have been oh it's its just controlled f for it dude uh this was posted by victorious secret on the
[3597.16 → 3605.16] forum yes and this video is amazing i like i love this thing um, so basically there's been an issue with
[3605.16 → 3611.08] um let's go ahead and screen share people flying drones over top of French uh nuclear reactors
[3611.08 → 3621.40] like DJI drones so uh so they're deploying anti-drone drones to go find those drones and break their
[3621.40 → 3631.24] shit wow i expected to like to fly it down but nope holy crap nope love it absolutely love the
[3631.24 → 3639.80] way that uh the way that just got done so um i guess the real conversation here is not uh is not
[3639.80 → 3642.92] what they should do they've probably done this to a certain degree but i want them to bring it to
[3642.92 → 3649.00] like TV and make it mainstream you know how they had robot wars big drone wars i think someone must
[3649.00 → 3656.12] be trying to do on TV though i I'm not sure if i know that uh i know that uh what's that show that's
[3656.12 → 3661.72] coming back battle bots is coming back but really yeah battle bots that's awesome i don't know if
[3661.72 → 3665.96] they're still going to have like carmen Electra and stuff but oh i don't care the format is coming
[3665.96 → 3671.16] all i care about there was the robots i didn't even know she was on there me neither someone else
[3671.16 → 3676.76] told me i had no clue i was like i think i was young enough when battle bots was cool to not care
[3677.16 → 3680.76] hadn't you know matured yet yeah so to speak yeah uh
[3683.00 → 3688.76] that's cool i loved that show was awesome i remember my favorite battle
[3688.76 → 3695.56] bot ever was this completely op spinning one that just like it is went up against some like
[3695.56 → 3700.60] elaborate contraption that was like yes i will do this and i will do that, and then it was just like
[3700.60 → 3705.32] this like superfast spinning one it basically like went up to it and just like broke pieces off of the
[3705.32 → 3710.36] other one it's like it would like to try to attack it and the spinning one just, just crack pieces off it
[3710.36 → 3722.60] love battle bots um let's go ahead and uh oh yeah so right drones and privacy and all
[3722.60 → 3727.08] this kind of stuff i actually posted this on Twitter last night that's good footage holy crap uh here's
[3727.08 → 3734.60] some footage of yes i know I'm live on twitch like it should not show me that I'm me just like how
[3734.60 → 3739.64] it shows a verification that it's working ads i guess so fine but ads on my own videos
[3739.64 → 3743.08] verification that they're enabled verification that they're enabled but I'm not technically
[3743.08 → 3748.12] allowed to click on my own ads or as far as i know watch my own ads like i think that's against the
[3748.12 → 3755.40] user that's why i have ads enabled for my account on the forum, so this is 1080p um, so this is really
[3755.40 → 3763.80] good this isn't the most interesting part i think i go up quite a bit higher so as drone cameras get
[3763.80 → 3772.84] better and better and better the ability to spy on people and things is going to get become more and
[3772.84 → 3778.52] more and more of a concern so i mean you know right now maybe it's a nuclear power plant which is like
[3778.52 → 3785.30] enough of a problem, but you know hey you want to keep track of the route you know that kid takes home
[3785.30 → 3790.28] from school or like there are all kinds of this is amazing creepy stuff that you can do with this and this i
[3790.28 → 3794.82] didn't even go that high i still had the 30-meter cap on i increased it I'm amazed at how stable it is
[3794.82 → 3800.74] i increased it to 60 on my next flight and um i didn't upload that one unfortunately, but this is uh
[3800.74 → 3806.98] this is me and my son down here yeah it's absolutely incredible the kind of video quality that we're
[3806.98 → 3812.20] getting off of these drones these days so i think it's cool that the French have come up with a
[3812.20 → 3818.68] creative solution to eliminating how medieval that net is i know i love it that's so cool
[3818.68 → 3824.98] it's like we just wrecked your stuff get dunked uh so, so far 13 of the country's 19 facilities have
[3824.98 → 3830.10] been buzzed so they're looking to for a way to stop quadcopters from messing with nuclear reactors
[3830.10 → 3839.34] um blah blah blah the drone that was photographed is an interceptor mp200 so you have to check out uh
[3839.34 → 3845.94] where is it, and they used the interceptor to catch a DJI phantom that was piloted by
[3845.94 → 3853.02] the company's CEO, so the interceptor is a much larger and faster drone with six rotors and the
[3853.02 → 3860.18] net it carries is uh pretty BM um Luke has another link to uh to an effective method for taking out
[3860.18 → 3867.22] drones this is the kamikaze, so this little guy just goes nuts and smashes itself into the other
[3867.22 → 3874.68] one, and you can see still frame shots of how it works so if you scroll down so it flies into the
[3874.68 → 3878.76] other drone and just mashes into its propellers breaking stuff off and then they both crash
[3878.76 → 3883.50] it's a lot cheaper than the one with the net because the one with the net has to be very strong
[3883.50 → 3887.88] it has six propellers to be able to carry the net because the net is really happy uh heavy sorry
[3887.88 → 3896.62] this one is very inexpensive and just nails into other ones hilarious um wow yeah it's just this little
[3896.62 → 3901.42] quad wing little thing, and you can see just yeah they're both just super wrecked
[3902.46 → 3909.14] wow awesome i love it i have to imagine firing a projectile would be easier than carrying a net
[3909.14 → 3913.96] part of the yeah, and you're kind of firing projectile with this the reason why you don't
[3913.96 → 3918.58] want to fire something like a bullet is because it could miss no bullet no, no but i didn't mean
[3918.58 → 3924.86] bullet i meant like uh like um like some kind of like like like if you could is you like and i don't
[3924.86 → 3930.42] know if this exists no flag but like a goofy surf a surf okay like a goof goofy substance like if you
[3930.42 → 3936.20] could just fire like uh like a ball of like stringy slash goofy stuff that tangles it or something like
[3936.20 → 3940.22] basically yeah if you could fire like a ball of yarn at a drone that would be very likely to take it down
[3940.22 → 3946.26] yarn is going to have troubles flying yeah so unless it's actually a tight ball, and it's not going to do
[3946.26 → 3951.14] anything or if it impacts and like unfolds or something like if it was like a spring-loaded
[3951.14 → 3955.58] like all the yarn kind of goes everywhere, or you could something or yeah yeah yeah like you could
[3955.58 → 3960.66] probably make something that is an entanglement mechanism that you could fire at other drones
[3960.66 → 3968.58] yeah um but i mean i you know this works yeah boom um speaking of things that work uh this was
[3968.58 → 3974.12] posted by Victoria's secret the article we've got here is from tech crunch apple's activation lock
[3974.12 → 3981.84] leading to a significant decrease in iPhone theft in major cities this is one of those why didn't we
[3981.84 → 3987.00] do this before things it's like you know apple and the carriers are running around all worried about
[3987.00 → 3993.04] you know us using the phone on the wrong carrier with absolutely no regard for all these years for
[3993.04 → 3999.42] the wrong person using the phone on the right carrier and so California mandated these kill switches
[3999.42 → 4003.44] and said they were going to bring a bill into law something it's not actually active yet
[4003.44 → 4012.70] but apple has proactively started enabling this lockdown feature by default on iPhones and there's
[4012.70 → 4017.24] some fascinating numbers to go along with this so the number of stolen iPhones dropped by 40
[4017.24 → 4026.68] in San Francisco and 25 in New York and smartphone theft dropped by 50 in London in the 12 months after
[4026.68 → 4033.04] apple added the kill switch that's amazing that's awesome because basically it turns a stolen iPhone
[4033.04 → 4042.64] even if you can unlock it into like a glorified like iPod touch so it's not worth not a brick but
[4042.64 → 4048.76] yeah no one's really going to want it so, so far apple Samsung and Google have implemented kill
[4048.76 → 4052.86] switches on their smartphones Microsoft is expected to release an operating system for its windows
[4052.86 → 4058.48] phones that have one this year um but some of the smartphone systems require consumers to opt in
[4058.48 → 4064.20] and uh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah trainee general called on all manufacturers to make the
[4064.20 → 4067.62] technology active as a default position as apple has done with the iPhones i mean i don't think
[4067.62 → 4072.98] anyone's going to force you um except as law requires in the area that you happen to live i don't think
[4072.98 → 4077.82] anyone will force you to use a kill switch anytime soon but having the uh having it on by default i think
[4077.82 → 4085.86] makes a ton of sense that's cool yeah i like that a lot go apple on that one uh FCC now requires
[4085.86 → 4091.52] American carriers to unlock consumers handsets also posted by Victoria's secret are you posting
[4091.52 → 4096.22] these yeah okay cool i wasn't sure if you were keeping up I'm trying not to you know glance at
[4096.22 → 4099.82] your screen because then it looks like I'm you know looking at something else and i did this and
[4099.82 → 4107.08] i was looking at your butt which is not possible when you're sitting on a couch but yeah FCC now
[4107.08 → 4112.94] requires American carriers to unlock consumers handsets this is not quite as awesome as it sounds
[4112.94 → 4120.66] initially so it's not like you can walk into your local carrier store, and you know go get some
[4120.66 → 4125.40] other carrier to bail you out of your contract fees, and then you can just take your device over
[4125.40 → 4131.82] to the other carrier um it has to be it has to be fully paid off and blip pity bloop pity blog and
[4131.82 → 4137.68] there's all this other stuff a lot of when you pay off your thing is fully paying off your phone though
[4137.68 → 4142.28] so i wonder how that would work because if you got bailed out that is technically fully paying off
[4142.28 → 4149.44] your phone, so this is only after the phone has been paid off under contract or if the phone was
[4149.44 → 4154.72] prepaid under contract okay yeah, so once payment has been completed consumers can do what they choose
[4154.72 → 4160.28] with their devices, so this is actually the result of talks between the FCC and CIA the cellular
[4160.28 → 4165.02] telecommunications industry association which represents major carriers AT&T sprint T-Mobile
[4165.02 → 4171.34] and Verizon wireless so um i mean there's no guarantee that carriers aren't still going to
[4171.34 → 4175.82] be buttheads and make you jump through hoops or whatever else, but ultimately they have to do it so
[4175.82 → 4181.58] you know other than making you talk to a retention agent or whatever the case may be i suspect we
[4181.58 → 4187.10] mostly won't have to deal with too much nonsense yeah well not we're in Canada we get no such benefit
[4187.10 → 4198.46] yeah not at all Americans yeah luckily America yeah all right the verge wow that is a big ad
[4198.46 → 4206.38] yep i am viewing at 70 right now oh no I'm not 100 they've had bigger ones that is that ford one that
[4206.38 → 4213.58] you showed me was like yep spectacular pretty much the entire screen wow yep that is a big ad
[4213.58 → 4220.86] it's like how does the verge afford their baller CES uh their baller CES internet connection
[4220.86 → 4228.46] upload or whatever like that yeah Elon Musk says tesla will unveil a new kind of battery to power your
[4228.46 → 4236.30] home why would they call him the eccentric CEO oh come on is he more eccentric than
[4236.30 → 4244.78] well lots of other innovative CEOs how many of those are there all right fine um
[4245.74 → 4250.54] so basically something tesla didn't ship as nearly as many cars as they predicted
[4250.54 → 4253.82] something maybe they have more batteries than they know what to do with not really sure what
[4253.82 → 4259.18] the background is here, but the company is working on a consumer battery pack for the home production
[4259.18 → 4264.70] could begin in six months, and they're still deciding on a date for unveiling the new unit this isn't exactly
[4264.70 → 4270.30] a new idea no the Toyota Mira which uses a hydrogen fuel cell gives all owners the option
[4270.30 → 4274.94] to remove the battery and use it to supply electrical power to their homes, and it can power the average
[4274.94 → 4281.10] home for about a week which is crazy which is awesome what some cool things that tesla's planning to do
[4281.10 → 4285.50] is they're planning on making the battery wall mountable and having like kind of cool design so
[4285.50 → 4292.30] it won't look really bad and it's knowing them it'll be tall if your wall mounting it so if you're not
[4292.30 → 4296.78] not flat on the ground it would be tall but relatively skinny right so it could actually
[4296.78 → 4302.06] maybe work somewhere right uh which is kind of cool very easily put it in the garage and have
[4302.06 → 4306.06] no problems or if you have a very like high-tech looking area have it there, and it'll probably be
[4306.06 → 4313.74] fine um fairly plug and play which is kind of awesome yeah this stuff is really cool I'm totally down
[4313.74 → 4318.54] with having like I'd love to ups my whole house that's essentially yeah what this would be and that
[4318.54 → 4325.98] would be awesome yeah uh BMW developing new plug-in hybrid named as i5 slash i7 to compete against
[4325.98 → 4333.42] intel excuse me the tesla model s uh yeah i7 should have like four normal wheels like and then four like
[4333.98 → 4336.62] wheels beside them, but they're not like really the same
[4339.02 → 4344.46] and go slightly faster yeah very slightly faster yeah just a little bit faster not too much faster yeah
[4344.46 → 4350.22] let's be really clear about not much faster just a little bit and four wheels help or something
[4351.02 → 4357.02] uh, so our original article here is from car magazine.co.uk, and it was posted by ah Ming did you post
[4357.02 → 4363.10] that in twitch shot already all right let's go ahead and uh fire this baby up so uh looks like this is
[4363.10 → 4372.06] to take on the model s um i guess that shouldn't be too unexpected yep uh it'll be priced to suit with
[4372.06 → 4376.54] target volumes in the tens of thousands and a cost spanning from just below the tesla to more than
[4376.54 → 4384.38] 125 000. I think it's cool the way electric cars can actually span an enormous price range and still
[4384.38 → 4391.50] make sense yeah because you can upgrade and downgrade them and like the performance still makes sense for
[4391.50 → 4396.22] high for a higher price car but like we still get that mostly that or at least some of that down there
[4396.22 → 4403.10] but then you can kind of go yeah I don't need to like the know like the fetus cow leather double
[4403.10 → 4410.22] stitched interior or whatever the hell yeah um all right what else do we know about this I'm sure
[4410.22 → 4414.06] there's something this I think this was added really late I didn't see this in the dock until we started
[4414.06 → 4420.62] going oh okay so 45 four and a half percent of all units sold in the pace setting us carb states must be
[4420.62 → 4427.10] zero emission vehicles by 2018. So yes expect to see more electric models and for them to become
[4427.10 → 4434.22] more and more affordable the e unit in front delivers 204 brake horsepower and the smaller battery powered
[4434.22 → 4440.54] motor in the back is good for 95 brake horsepower sources say whatever they are this brings the aggregate
[4440.54 → 4448.30] target output to 400 kilowatts or 544 brake horsepower so right in the middle of tesla territory allegedly
[4448.30 → 4454.06] capable of a zero emission range of 80 miles this BMW is designed to operate in battery mode most of
[4454.06 → 4460.14] the time the combustion engine will typically only cut in above 40 miles per hour when road and wind
[4460.14 → 4465.74] noise out decibel it anyway so it should be very silent to drive much like other electric vehicles
[4466.70 → 4473.26] I think now manufacturers who fail to comply by not offering enough zero emission vehicles uh transitional
[4473.26 → 4477.90] zero emission vehicles neighbourhood electric vehicles or e-vehicles with range extenders have no choice
[4477.90 → 4483.74] but to acquire clean air credits from sources like tesla currently the major provider of such
[4483.74 → 4490.86] certificates and that makes German carmakers very sad um all right I think that's pretty much pretty
[4490.86 → 4496.46] much it uh we've got we've got some more stuff NVIDIA sends uh is sending out press invitations to a
[4496.46 → 4503.02] March 3rd event that I actually can't make it to um unfortunately their CEO Jensen says that what
[4503.02 → 4506.94] they're showing off will redefine the future of gaming
[4510.78 → 4515.98] let that sink in for a minute we'll redefine doesn't say anything about a good definition but
[4515.98 → 4521.02] uh the picture shows a thin device it's speculated to be another android tablet I doubt it if it's going
[4521.02 → 4526.06] to redefine the future of gaming it won't be uh an iterative release of something they've already done
[4526.06 → 4531.90] there may be a tablet we might get a Terra you know x1 tablet or something or whatever the latest one
[4531.90 → 4537.74] is can't remember um we might get a Terra x1 tablet, but it'll probably be something to do with cloud
[4537.74 → 4543.34] gaming to go along with it that would be my guess um grid I got an I got a nope as long as it's not
[4543.34 → 4552.14] embargoed I got absolutely nothing until I find out um something nothing I learned nothing and nothing
[4552.14 → 4561.82] happened um so anyway close that I'm sorry close that why is that even open uh because I was reading it
[4561.82 → 4570.78] uh so anyway Donati pc game sales surpassed their Xbox One sales they went from two percent to ten
[4570.78 → 4577.34] percent year over year and um has surpassed Xbox One and all handhelds now going head-to-head with
[4577.34 → 4584.62] the Xbox 360 this was posted by oh the previous one was abhey6547 and this one was death jester and the
[4584.62 → 4594.62] original article here is from DS DSO gaming.com skip this ad haha no money for you um well I'm in a
[4594.62 → 4599.42] hurry I think they get a little money for that no I'm pretty sure they still do I mean there's this ad
[4600.30 → 4604.30] no they get a little money for you skipping and there's this ad yeah I know oh yeah they I think
[4604.30 → 4607.74] they get a little bit on that, and they get money for these ads they don't really expect okay how about
[4607.74 → 4611.50] I click swing copters to make them feel better I'm actually I'm legitimately interested in swing
[4611.50 → 4617.74] copters this looks excellent okay client download required optional software included how can optional
[4617.74 → 4625.74] software be included isn't that the definition of optional it says optional software included yeah
[4625.74 → 4630.62] yeah what does that mean it means you probably download this game, and then it's like do you want
[4630.62 → 4636.70] to also install this why would they even put that in a banner that's very honest yeah I've never
[4636.70 → 4641.34] seen anyone advertise that there's optional software included all right I'm gonna I'm going to do a full
[4641.34 → 4646.86] review of swing copters uh coming up super fun yeah channel super fun review of swing copters
[4648.22 → 4652.22] Facebook rolls out a feature for users when they die this was posted by f not on the forum
[4652.22 → 4658.22] oh my god we should do real life swing copies with a drone yes absolutely
[4661.42 → 4666.38] not sure exactly how this works but gives users the option of having their account permanently
[4666.38 → 4670.54] deleted when they die or if they wish they can appoint a friend or family member to take control
[4670.54 → 4676.46] of some aspects of the account that's interesting uh an interesting note that was added to the doc too
[4676.46 → 4682.70] is how do they confirm your death I don't know i I don't I don't understand why Facebook needs a
[4683.58 → 4685.74] gee I don't know just leave it
[4688.14 → 4695.02] uh what else we got here VESA publishes embedded display port standard 1.4a includes adaptive sync so this
[4695.02 → 4700.46] will be good for devices that need embedded display port like say for example small stuff
[4700.94 → 4709.34] um greater data rates 8.1 gigabit per second per lane theoretical limit of 32.4 gigabit per second
[4709.34 → 4716.86] we've got ultra HD support at 120 hertz with 10-bit colour because you know display port just isn't content
[4716.86 → 4724.14] to wreck HDMI a little bit at every turn and everything else uh WhatsApp oh that was uh
[4724.14 → 4728.46] posted by QWERTY warrior and the original article here is from Tom's hardware this is all our rapid
[4728.46 → 4734.78] fire topics by the way that's why I'm rapid firing them VESA publish oh I already did this well
[4734.78 → 4742.54] basically that's what that website looks like you're welcome um next up what do we get the WhatsApp thing
[4742.54 → 4746.30] yeah the WhatsApp thing WhatsApp may not be as private as some people thought it's supposed to
[4746.30 → 4751.50] buy whammy it's very unfortunate super not surprising at all thought anything that you
[4751.50 → 4758.06] posted to anything Facebook owns or really anything on the internet was private yeah um so it's what spy
[4758.94 → 4766.70] public is this app that um that I think it's a guy yeah some guy made and here's this project I made
[4766.70 → 4772.14] this for you to realize how broken the privacy options in WhatsApp are I mean this is something that
[4772.14 → 4778.14] anyone from like the MSN messenger days is probably already familiar with like you could see if
[4778.14 → 4785.10] someone blocked you just by entering their username into a website which by the way Microsoft patched
[4785.10 → 4791.66] and became impossible yet another way that MSN was way ahead of its time and everything else that's
[4791.66 → 4798.70] come after it totally sucks balls um MSN was great so anyway you can see online and offline status profile
[4798.70 → 4805.82] pictures privacy settings and status messages from anyone even if they have the most secure private
[4805.82 → 4812.94] settings enabled in their account and so the point of this was just hey we should probably draw some
[4812.94 → 4823.58] attention to this um feels a little what would this be gray hat yeah I guess speaking of hats um anonymous
[4823.58 → 4829.74] attacks Isis websites and social media accounts uh this was posted online as tech tips' forum by Sauron
[4829.74 → 4838.62] and our original article here is from the hackernews.com and I mean the thing about when anonymous does
[4838.62 → 4846.78] anything is that that's not necessarily that doesn't mean that everyone in anonymous is a united front doing
[4846.78 → 4851.26] something it means someone saying they're anonymous because that's the whole point it was
[4851.26 → 4856.94] anonymous they declared what group within if it was I don't remember where it says red something I think
[4857.66 → 4863.66] has launched a something something I don't know where it is, but it's the red cult
[4863.66 → 4869.26] anonymous group and red cult announced the operation hashtag op Isis and claimed to have carried out
[4869.26 → 4874.54] cyberattacks against hundreds of Twitter and Facebook accounts used by Isis for its own propaganda
[4874.54 → 4881.58] and to recruit new members according to the video it's coordinated by Muslim Christians Jews alike
[4881.58 → 4889.90] and a masked individual discusses the aim of the campaign so uh they are releasing uh lists of twitter
[4889.90 → 4895.66] and Facebook accounts suspected to belong to Islamic militants and Twitter has already suspended more
[4895.66 → 4901.82] than 1500 Isis accounts since the group released the first list in June 2014 and dozens of militant recruiting
[4901.82 → 4907.90] websites were knocked offline using collective DDoS attack i have to say it's nice to see it's nice to
[4907.90 → 4914.14] see them doing something positive they sometimes do they do that um anonymously so we don't know who's
[4914.14 → 4920.78] doing good who's doing bad who's doing something in between who knows, but someone is doing something and I think
[4920.78 → 4927.58] hopefully we can all agree that Isis is a bunch of buttholes and um anything we can do to make them
[4927.58 → 4935.34] not be quite such buttholes is good yes taking down communication lines of any sort is a very
[4935.34 → 4940.46] effective thing in these types of situations yep so it might not seem like much but it yeah it might
[4940.46 → 4946.30] be like oh web activism is dumb actually not necessarily not being able to get your message
[4946.30 → 4953.10] out there when your entire thing is that you're you are broadcasting this message in hopes of you know
[4953.10 → 4958.38] finding like-minded individual individuals and inspiring them to do unspeakable things um actually
[4958.38 → 4964.54] that's super it's very effective it's like it's like plant on rock effective it's super effective
[4966.86 → 4972.78] I mean the only thing about anonymous is that they're they're not employed they're not um
[4973.42 → 4980.30] like there's no there's no long-term commitment to you know 2018 when Isis is still doing
[4980.30 → 4983.66] whatever it is they're doing there's no like there's no long-term action plan or anything like
[4983.66 → 4989.58] that, but it's good that they're doing something anything at all now um I guess that's pretty much
[4989.58 → 5001.50] it for like the key stuff today this is a short show yeah wow a short painful show yeah for you yeah I had fun
[5001.50 → 5011.98] not because it was painful for you, it's just a bonus oh man I do have an exciting announcement
[5011.98 → 5019.42] though um I am going to be doing the first garage sale in a very long time today it is going to be
[5020.30 → 5026.62] as soon as I figure out how all the tools work the after party is going to be straight up garage sale today
[5026.62 → 5033.10] because there is some stuff that needs to not be here anymore and is here right now um and I need
[5033.10 → 5038.62] it has gone so that is why I am doing it uh so that's pretty much if we'll see you guys next week same
[5038.62 → 5042.78] bat time same bat channel thank you for tuning into the wan show and um
[5047.50 → 5051.66] sorry I got some emails I was just going to say I think he's just on his phone now so I'm going to cut
[5051.66 → 5056.14] this so that the archive doesn't look super wait don't cut it you have to do the outro
[5059.02 → 5070.14] oh oh oh there we go
[5070.14 → 5077.50] do
[5077.50 → 5079.50] do
[5079.50 → 5083.50] do
[5083.50 → 5085.10] do
