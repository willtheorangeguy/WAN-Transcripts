[0.00 → 2.98] We had a couple of complications before the show,
[3.12 → 5.60] but you guys aren't going to concern yourselves with that.
[5.84 → 8.86] So let's get a rousing chorus of,
[9.38 → 11.88] ah, they're late, in the Twitch chat,
[12.00 → 13.84] and we can all get it out of our system.
[14.70 → 16.78] Linus late or late Linus or whatever.
[16.96 → 17.30] I don't remember.
[17.36 → 18.00] They say something.
[18.18 → 19.22] They're probably saying it right now.
[19.30 → 20.48] They're probably saying it right now,
[20.54 → 22.92] so it would be helpful if we actually looked at that.
[23.16 → 24.22] You're kind of cut off.
[24.22 → 27.56] If I kind of scorched over a little bit, would that help?
[28.08 → 29.30] I didn't really shook.
[29.30 → 30.68] I just want to sit closer to him.
[31.16 → 34.74] So let's go ahead and have a look at what our topics are for the day.
[35.14 → 38.26] It's actually a surprisingly jam-packed show,
[38.40 → 40.94] so it's unfortunate that we weren't able to get started on time.
[41.00 → 42.78] We had to replace the batteries and the microphone.
[43.56 → 45.78] I realized right before the show,
[45.86 → 47.62] normally we leave everything all set up
[47.62 → 49.20] so that we can get things going pretty quickly,
[49.30 → 53.48] and I was like, oh, yeah, our last WEN show was in Vegas.
[53.72 → 56.66] We took our streaming gear to Vegas.
[56.82 → 58.06] It's not set up.
[58.06 → 61.44] So we had to get everything all set back up again.
[61.44 → 65.26] But other than that, we are pretty much ready to rock here.
[65.44 → 68.50] So some sort of top topics today.
[69.28 → 74.50] Microsoft and Google are scrapping over patch-fixing policies
[74.50 → 80.88] and sort of airing dirty laundry in public about each other's bug reports.
[80.88 → 87.08] The new Nintendo 3DS to not include a power adapter in North America.
[87.88 → 89.18] Are you beautiful?
[89.42 → 89.98] I am.
[90.10 → 92.76] You might be able to eat for free at a certain restaurant,
[92.94 → 94.84] and GTA 5 has been delayed.
[94.88 → 95.72] Eat what exactly?
[95.72 → 101.20] General food?
[101.52 → 102.60] Super normal things?
[103.48 → 105.12] I'm trying to make a beautiful face.
[105.18 → 105.96] It's not going very well.
[106.06 → 106.58] Okay, go ahead.
[107.34 → 108.02] I'm done.
[108.60 → 108.86] Oh.
[109.00 → 109.44] That was it.
[109.52 → 110.24] GTA 5 delayed?
[110.32 → 111.24] That's all you're going to say about it?
[111.34 → 111.52] Yeah.
[111.64 → 114.08] Right, because we're going to save it for later on in the show.
[114.26 → 114.80] Boom intro.
[114.80 → 115.90] La-di-da.
[117.82 → 119.48] That's not the music for our intro.
[119.72 → 123.58] It's door-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot.
[124.26 → 125.88] Welcome to the WED show.
[126.96 → 127.94] Ramstein intro.
[128.34 → 129.30] Metal edition.
[134.82 → 137.40] And our sponsors today are Squarespace.
[137.76 → 139.72] Make an awesome website with Squarespace.
[140.90 → 142.50] It doesn't have to be square.
[142.64 → 143.84] It could be widescreen.
[145.76 → 147.14] And lynda.com.
[147.38 → 149.72] You don't have to read a book, but you could.
[150.04 → 152.78] But that's not really what lynda.com is about.
[154.36 → 157.32] Alright, so it's going to be a good show today, guys.
[157.58 → 161.86] We're going to kick off with something that's actually not new at all.
[162.00 → 166.06] This article is from like two or three weeks ago.
[166.66 → 169.92] And we even, okay, I know it says it's old, but we never discuss it.
[170.08 → 170.58] We did.
[171.70 → 173.68] We just both were like, whatever.
[173.68 → 173.88] Whatever.
[174.76 → 175.44] Oh, alright.
[175.44 → 177.36] And just agreed that it was stupid and moved on.
[177.48 → 180.30] At any rate, boom, here's the BBC article.
[180.50 → 182.22] I'll go ahead and screen share with you guys.
[182.60 → 189.36] But, uh, WoW Maker says that video games should be in the Olympics.
[189.36 → 193.84] And there are some arguments on either side of this.
[194.04 → 194.24] Okay.
[195.20 → 195.74] Video games.
[195.82 → 203.54] See, I went, and I used one of those words that mainstream media uses to, you know, make it seem less legitimate.
[203.74 → 204.20] What did you say?
[204.30 → 205.56] I called them video games.
[206.22 → 206.44] Oh.
[206.44 → 207.70] I should have called theme Sports.
[207.82 → 208.32] Excuse me.
[208.40 → 208.88] Very different.
[212.20 → 212.48] What?
[212.58 → 213.84] I'm being a little bit facetious.
[213.84 → 214.10] Okay.
[214.30 → 215.16] Just a touch.
[215.26 → 215.64] Just a touch.
[215.72 → 215.82] Okay.
[215.98 → 216.00] Okay.
[216.00 → 221.72] So, so there are a couple, there are a couple good points that the, uh, that the WoW Creator brings up.
[221.78 → 226.20] I'm just going to go ahead and switch back to my laptop here so I can look at what they were because I don't memorize all these things.
[226.20 → 239.00] So, number one is that they're well positioned to be a spectator sport, uh, given that you can fill, uh, you know, tens of thousands of spectators coliseum for a live event in some parts of the world.
[239.00 → 245.86] And, I mean, the North American viewers out there might kind of go, well, yeah, but just because you can kind of do it there doesn't mean that it should be a big deal.
[245.96 → 249.42] Well, I mean, the reality of it is North America is not the centre of the universe.
[249.42 → 266.66] And I don't know if this is still true, and it was either 2008 or 2012, my facts are a little bit hazy here, but I believe it was the badminton men's singles gold medal match that was the most watched sporting event of that entire, of that entire Summer Games Olympics.
[266.94 → 270.22] And it's basically non-existent in North America.
[270.38 → 273.84] Yeah, I thought you were going to say, like, ever, and I'm like, I'm pretty sure that was something to do with soccer.
[274.04 → 274.30] But, yeah.
[274.44 → 274.56] Yeah.
[274.56 → 274.70] Okay.
[274.70 → 279.64] No, just because, just because no one watches it here doesn't necessarily, or.
[279.64 → 282.20] And people watch it here, and people go to live gaming events here.
[282.22 → 283.14] It's pretty rare.
[283.24 → 284.68] I know they did one at the Staples Centre.
[285.20 → 285.46] Yeah.
[285.62 → 287.12] But that's kind of it.
[287.20 → 289.70] It's like, yeah, there was that one they did at the Staples Centre.
[289.76 → 291.16] That doesn't make it an Olympic.
[291.46 → 293.82] It happens, but not on the same scale at all.
[293.82 → 294.04] Yes.
[294.18 → 295.84] It's same, I guess, similar with tennis.
[295.90 → 297.34] People watch it, but not on the same scale.
[297.44 → 302.68] So, and then the other argument is I think the way you look at esports is as a very competitive skill set,
[302.68 → 306.32] and you're looking at these professional gamers with reflexes that are lightning quick,
[306.54 → 310.92] and quick decision-making, you know, upwards of 300 actions per minute,
[311.00 → 318.38] although the whole actions per minute metric is one of those that I think we've pretty much stopped acknowledging at this point, I hope.
[318.38 → 326.50] And so, you know, the comment is video games would first need to win a cultural battle over physical sports.
[327.00 → 333.06] So, with all of that said, the IOC, the International Olympic Committee,
[333.38 → 338.02] has already kind of laid down the law as far as, you know, new events goes.
[338.16 → 339.94] They're only going to have a fixed number of events,
[340.00 → 342.76] so that means that if you want to add something, you have to remove something else.
[342.76 → 345.84] And as questionable as some of the things in the Olympics,
[346.12 → 349.18] I actually don't follow Summer Olympics as closely as I do Winter Olympics,
[349.36 → 351.62] but I mean, come on, figure skating and ice dancing?
[352.38 → 353.10] Like, really?
[353.52 → 355.56] And someone's going to give me crap over this.
[355.60 → 359.06] In fact, I hope my new contact at Sony isn't watching right now,
[359.14 → 366.02] because, yeah, she's, actually, no, she's a figure skating judge, not an ice dance judge.
[366.02 → 371.82] And my understanding is figure skaters, for the most part, look at ice dance as kind of,
[372.00 → 374.16] why are you even here?
[374.48 → 378.26] Figure skating, in its own regard, is pretty freaking intense.
[378.58 → 379.82] I don't know much about ice dance.
[380.00 → 384.62] Ice dance is kind of like figure skating, but more dancing.
[384.80 → 386.28] No, figure skating has partners, too.
[386.60 → 387.48] Like, that's exactly it.
[387.48 → 388.54] I don't know much about, I don't know.
[388.54 → 390.36] Where it's just like, why do we need both of them?
[390.92 → 391.48] Okay, yeah.
[391.66 → 392.46] We should probably just...
[392.46 → 395.70] But, like, figure skating is quite physically challenging.
[395.70 → 401.80] So, okay, I guess whether they win this battle is going to come down to
[401.80 → 404.56] whether they can find something less worthy to knock out,
[405.02 → 410.56] and whether it's possible to win the battle of should what is effectively...
[410.56 → 412.70] Yes, there's a physical component, but...
[413.26 → 415.72] Yeah, you can't really even say...
[415.72 → 420.66] Well, no, like, a point at the bottom of this where it's a mind sport is a perfect point.
[421.04 → 424.54] Because chess supporters have wanted chess to be in the Olympics for a long time,
[424.54 → 430.42] and I think if you were to look at the Olympics as sort of, you know, it's a traditional thing,
[430.52 → 434.44] it's all about the legacy of whatever it is, and esports being very new,
[434.70 → 437.90] probably don't necessarily fall under that.
[438.22 → 438.80] Chess would.
[438.92 → 443.86] I mean, chess has a long history, and if we're not going to include that,
[443.94 → 445.22] then should we include esports first?
[445.22 → 449.14] If we included stuff like chess, I think it would make more sense.
[449.82 → 450.12] Right.
[450.12 → 454.26] Because we have added newer sports to the tradition of the Olympics.
[455.14 → 458.32] But of course there's the like, there's the business aspect as well,
[458.40 → 461.42] going back to the if you're going to do esports, you should probably do chess argument,
[461.56 → 465.50] because compared to esports, chess doesn't draw nearly the same kind of crowd.
[465.56 → 466.48] No, I meant the other way around.
[466.74 → 470.46] If they were playing chess already, it would make more sense for them to do...
[470.46 → 471.44] Then esports is a no-brainer.
[471.44 → 473.08] Including the mind game stuff, should we close the door?
[473.30 → 475.52] Yeah, I'll close the door, because those guys are loud.
[475.82 → 476.82] Can I move into our next topic?
[477.64 → 477.96] Sure.
[478.44 → 480.08] I don't think there was really much to say on that.
[480.12 → 483.40] It's just the mind sport thing, if it comes down to it, in my opinion.
[483.56 → 485.06] They don't do the mind sport stuff.
[485.14 → 488.84] I mean, what that says, I mean, okay, something like throwing a javelin.
[489.64 → 491.20] Okay, this is not a mind sport.
[491.72 → 493.46] Okay, I thought you were going to be like, that's a mind sport.
[493.52 → 494.16] I was like, dude.
[494.16 → 499.38] No, something like hockey, on the other hand, though, there is a huge mental component.
[499.38 → 501.20] So, yes, it's physical.
[501.42 → 503.82] There's a mental component to every sport.
[504.46 → 505.00] Javelin throwing?
[505.24 → 506.34] There's a mental component to it.
[506.38 → 507.38] Okay, there's a mental...
[507.38 → 509.98] Okay, I shouldn't have said mental, I should have said mind.
[510.36 → 511.36] Because they're not...
[511.36 → 513.56] The connotation is slightly different.
[513.92 → 519.46] You don't use your mind to throw a javelin, but there's like a mental resilience under pressure
[519.46 → 524.04] component to any competition, whether it's a physical one or anything else.
[524.06 → 525.72] You still use your mind to throw a javelin.
[525.72 → 528.76] Okay, you use your mind to throw a javelin.
[528.82 → 530.98] We're not talking freaking telekinesis here.
[531.06 → 535.98] We're talking about you use your mind to tell the arm that it should probably go ahead and
[535.98 → 536.54] do this.
[536.64 → 539.60] No, I know, but also if you're in outdoor stadiums, you have to judge other things.
[539.68 → 540.38] Like, it's...
[540.38 → 542.34] Anyway, there's no point in arguing this.
[543.14 → 544.04] But there's...
[544.04 → 545.86] You have to use your brain in every sport.
[546.30 → 547.54] But it's like...
[547.54 → 548.40] Anyway, whatever.
[549.46 → 550.10] Google...
[550.10 → 552.34] Oh, should we just go into the Google versus Microsoft thing?
[552.90 → 553.74] Yeah, sure.
[553.88 → 554.30] Why not?
[554.30 → 554.78] Oh, God.
[554.94 → 555.14] Okay.
[555.46 → 558.98] So there's essentially two stories to this.
[559.14 → 560.44] So I'm going to start with the first story.
[561.12 → 561.68] Google...
[561.68 → 562.30] What the...
[563.22 → 564.70] Okay, so I'm going to mess with my notes here a little bit.
[564.70 → 565.90] Did you copy the link already?
[566.18 → 566.56] I'm doing it.
[566.56 → 567.10] No, I did not.
[567.22 → 567.66] Okay, sorry.
[567.94 → 571.08] I will do that from now on if I make sure I'm logged in.
[571.18 → 576.54] Google released details on a security vulnerability in Windows 8.1, 48 hours before Microsoft was
[576.54 → 577.80] ready to release a patch for it.
[577.80 → 583.58] Microsoft claims, and I believe Google is not refuting this at all, that they were in contact
[583.58 → 587.18] with Google and were like, guys, we're releasing a patch for this in two days.
[587.24 → 587.76] Patch Tuesday.
[588.22 → 589.24] Please don't.
[589.60 → 590.32] Do this.
[590.32 → 592.54] And then Google was like, nope, releasing it.
[592.54 → 597.66] Google's whole idea for this, and Microsoft is calling for them to be more flexible and
[597.66 → 601.12] work with them in the future when it has to do with the vulnerabilities of millions and
[601.12 → 601.74] millions of users.
[602.24 → 608.30] Google's rebuttal is that they have a standard 90-day policy when it comes to releasing data
[608.30 → 609.06] about vulnerabilities.
[609.70 → 613.64] And the policy and the reason this exists and all that kind of stuff is to pressure companies
[613.64 → 615.58] into fixing vulnerabilities more quickly.
[616.24 → 620.74] Now, when it was already fixed, and it was coming out in two days, maybe that shouldn't
[620.74 → 622.84] apply, but that is their policy, so that's what they're doing.
[623.24 → 627.94] Story two is that, so there's that fight already going on.
[628.04 → 632.24] Story two is that while Google is slamming on other companies to fix vulnerabilities, they
[632.24 → 633.34] have their own problems.
[633.50 → 638.36] Google has received reports for vulnerability in Web View, which is a web renderer for Android,
[638.82 → 640.90] and it affects Jelly Bean users.
[640.90 → 646.26] The article that we have linked here to NeoWin is claiming that Jelly Bean is 60% of users.
[646.44 → 649.00] It's actually more about 46% of users.
[649.12 → 650.06] Of Android users.
[650.08 → 650.84] Of Android users.
[650.94 → 651.18] Be clear.
[652.64 → 657.52] It's 60 if you include the things before Jelly Bean, but I wasn't entirely certain if
[657.52 → 660.26] this vulnerability affected things that were before Jelly Bean as well.
[660.42 → 660.66] Right.
[660.86 → 663.68] So it's 46 or 60, I'm not entirely sure, but it's a lot.
[663.68 → 665.50] Either way, it's hundreds of millions.
[665.80 → 667.96] Yes, it's a massive percentage of people.
[667.96 → 672.76] And Google is refusing to fix it and will not work on it at all, because they will not
[672.76 → 675.72] work on anything at all that is pre-4.4 KitKat.
[676.12 → 681.36] Google is stating that if someone wants a fix for this, they can submit the patch in the
[681.36 → 686.42] report, and then Google will check it out, and if it's legitimate, they'll send it to
[686.42 → 688.04] OEMs and see what the OEMs deserve.
[688.04 → 692.68] And then the other option is they're saying the OEMs are more than welcome to patch it themselves.
[692.68 → 698.56] Which, I mean, if anyone here has ever bought, like, I'm going to pick on Samsung, because
[698.56 → 699.86] they're the biggest one in the Android space.
[699.86 → 701.00] Any hardware manufacturer that makes software?
[701.08 → 701.18] Yeah.
[701.40 → 709.00] Any, any, any handset manufacturer that makes their own skin on top of Android and basically
[709.00 → 711.82] supports it until the next flagship is out.
[711.90 → 712.32] Oh, what's that?
[712.36 → 712.64] Hold on.
[712.84 → 713.36] New one's out?
[713.44 → 713.78] Oh, bye.
[714.46 → 715.04] See ya.
[715.04 → 719.64] So, so pretty much, that's it.
[720.56 → 726.40] You get, you get to buy a new device, you get to, and I mean, I'm so sick of people saying,
[726.50 → 729.04] oh, well, you should just root and run a different ROM.
[729.76 → 730.84] Nobody does that.
[730.94 → 732.20] Like, someone does it.
[732.40 → 732.92] Yes, you do.
[733.00 → 733.50] That's fine.
[733.50 → 741.18] But when you're looking at that 46 to 60% possible metric of people, an tiny percentage
[741.18 → 741.66] of that is being free.
[741.66 → 746.70] The people who are still running Jellybean probably don't do that, because they probably
[746.70 → 748.44] wouldn't still be running Jellybean.
[748.54 → 752.64] And when you consider that there are new devices being sold today.
[752.86 → 753.56] That have Jellybean.
[753.58 → 755.34] Now running Jellybean.
[755.48 → 757.06] Like, this is a huge problem.
[757.16 → 758.98] And like, not a small amount of them.
[759.06 → 761.72] There's a fair amount of devices being sold now that have Jellybean on them.
[761.84 → 767.12] And I understand Google's issue here where they have such diversity in the, in the hardware
[767.12 → 772.24] that Android can be running on, that they, they can't individually support every device.
[772.24 → 777.66] And ultimately it does fall on the handset makers to support the devices that they sell.
[777.84 → 783.44] But the cold hard truth is the handset makers or device makers aren't doing it.
[783.44 → 789.02] And if Google doesn't support these older devices, at least with something like, uh, with, with a
[789.24 → 794.98] like, uh, a, a widespread fundamental flaw like this, if they opt not to support it,
[795.02 → 799.72] it ultimately reflects poorly on the Android experience and gives more ammunition to people like me.
[799.84 → 803.52] You know, it's amazing how many people, uh, called me, uh, an Apple fanboy.
[803.74 → 806.28] Or like, iPhone fanboys in my Nexus 6 review.
[806.44 → 806.94] You know what?
[807.02 → 807.18] Okay.
[807.42 → 808.86] Um, I haven't even watched it.
[808.92 → 809.62] I've heard of it.
[809.80 → 810.90] And I'm going to watch it.
[810.90 → 812.82] I just, this last two weeks has been a blur.
[813.26 → 814.00] Um, but.
[814.10 → 815.02] But can I finish that thought first?
[815.10 → 815.26] Sure.
[815.38 → 815.50] Yeah.
[815.54 → 821.14] It gives more ammunition to people like me who praise Apple for supporting their older devices
[821.14 → 824.14] much, much better than handset makers on the Android side.
[824.32 → 829.84] I still use my iPhone 4 almost every day as an MP3 player and a video streamer.
[830.18 → 834.78] Just if I, um, you know, if I'm in the bath or something and I don't want to risk dropping
[834.78 → 837.60] my actual phone, I'll grab it, and I'll, I'll throw it there.
[837.60 → 839.86] And it still runs everything I need it to do.
[839.86 → 843.84] My wife's Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant.
[844.14 → 846.82] That was the equivalent flagship Android phone.
[848.14 → 848.70] Okay.
[848.84 → 855.28] Aside from the micro USB connector, obviously dying because every single micro USB connector
[855.28 → 859.88] with, you know, I think the one on my Moto X is already going, uh, because they, they will
[859.88 → 861.08] all die eventually.
[861.08 → 862.88] It's a terrible, terrible connector.
[862.88 → 867.96] Aside from that dying on it, that thing was freaking useless by the end of its life.
[867.96 → 874.48] And that is a pattern that continues and comes right from Google on the Android side when
[874.48 → 876.34] Apple does not do that.
[876.86 → 880.36] Uh, but that said, I'm not an Apple fanboy.
[880.36 → 884.16] In fact, my daily driver right now is an Android phone.
[884.28 → 885.10] Whoa, look at that.
[885.18 → 889.12] Well, you can't really tell because that's a Twitter app, but okay.
[889.20 → 889.42] Sorry.
[889.48 → 890.00] What were you going to say?
[890.22 → 893.58] I'm, I'm conflicted now because you've probably known for a while now.
[893.64 → 896.66] I haven't been super stoked with my Moto X because it only lasts for half a day.
[896.66 → 904.00] But, um, it's, there's, this is my problem consistently with phones is there's no real great solution.
[904.14 → 909.34] I don't want to go to iOS because I don't like iOS, but things that I do on the phone
[909.34 → 915.30] a lot, Twitter, Instagram, social media stuff, email, all of that would work totally fine
[915.30 → 915.80] on iOS.
[916.00 → 920.30] Actually, Instagram would work considerably better and I would know the camera's good.
[920.52 → 923.76] Um, now I could just do more research and find an Android phone that has a good camera,
[923.76 → 927.30] but iPhone cameras are very good, and it would be totally fine.
[927.36 → 928.86] And my Instagram would work better.
[929.36 → 934.12] A lot of app support on iOS is better, which is frustrating because I'm an Android guy and
[934.12 → 935.14] I want to stick with Android.
[935.28 → 939.52] Now I'm interested in a turbo, but they don't even really sell them in Canada.
[940.02 → 941.42] They don't sell them at all in Canada.
[941.66 → 941.86] Yeah.
[942.04 → 942.30] Yeah.
[942.70 → 944.42] Like you can, you can try and import them.
[944.52 → 946.56] You can do all this other crap, but it's super frustrating.
[946.74 → 948.56] Like, God, this sucks.
[948.64 → 951.58] There's no good solution on the Android side, in my opinion, at all.
[951.96 → 952.92] Nexus 5 was excellent.
[952.92 → 953.22] In Canada.
[953.58 → 955.04] I'm honestly, not really.
[955.40 → 956.02] Well, it was cheap.
[956.18 → 956.90] Battery was crap.
[957.14 → 957.36] Yeah.
[958.12 → 959.44] That's a huge problem.
[959.82 → 960.04] Right.
[960.54 → 962.96] Like, God, phones just suck.
[963.04 → 964.60] The iPhone's battery is crap too.
[964.94 → 965.36] I know.
[965.46 → 965.92] If you actually...
[965.92 → 966.36] That's what I'm saying.
[966.42 → 967.42] There's no good solutions.
[967.48 → 972.16] The standby is excellent, but the actual in-use battery life is, is terrible.
[972.16 → 977.64] Like at, uh, at CES, I was using the iPhone 6 because, um, Phantom Glass doesn't have
[977.64 → 979.26] a cover for the Droid Turbo.
[979.42 → 979.58] Yeah.
[979.70 → 980.68] So I wasn't able to use it.
[980.68 → 984.20] Um, but yeah, so I was using the iPhone 6 every day.
[984.38 → 987.96] I was down to single digit battery at the end of the day and one day it just died while
[987.96 → 988.58] I was out and about.
[988.60 → 989.20] I had to charge it.
[989.22 → 993.54] I'm kind of sitting here going, I can't even get through a day with this phone.
[993.60 → 994.28] This is ridiculous.
[994.52 → 995.96] Whereas the Droid Turbo is awesome.
[995.96 → 998.18] Like, every single day, no matter what I do to it.
[998.24 → 1002.86] And like, people in Twitch chat are offering phones that are not good.
[1003.12 → 1003.80] OnePlus One.
[1004.42 → 1004.62] Not good.
[1004.62 → 1006.72] Actually, the OnePlus One is supposedly okay.
[1006.72 → 1006.74] Have you used it?
[1006.74 → 1007.76] I haven't used it yet.
[1007.76 → 1009.00] The experience is not great.
[1009.40 → 1010.68] I've used one of my friends.
[1011.20 → 1012.20] It's not awesome.
[1012.44 → 1015.46] And there's like stuff you have to go and fix yourself because it's just broken.
[1015.64 → 1016.58] It's way too big for me.
[1016.66 → 1016.88] It's stupid.
[1017.54 → 1019.78] Yeah, or they're too big or like other crap.
[1019.92 → 1020.74] It's just, ugh.
[1021.24 → 1023.46] I do not like phones because I think they're garbage.
[1023.54 → 1026.68] You should get the, um, oh crap, the Sync phone.
[1028.42 → 1029.84] You know the Sync phone, right?
[1030.04 → 1032.28] I've, yeah, isn't this...
[1032.28 → 1032.60] Yeah.
[1033.14 → 1034.82] Okay, we have to play this.
[1034.86 → 1035.42] We have to play this.
[1035.46 → 1036.76] This is an Adult Swim thing.
[1037.08 → 1037.50] Who knows?
[1037.50 → 1039.66] I might get a copyright strike or whatever.
[1039.78 → 1040.16] I don't care.
[1040.58 → 1040.84] Okay.
[1041.72 → 1043.34] Or should it be like, cannot be played in your region.
[1043.44 → 1043.98] Oh no, you're good.
[1044.18 → 1044.94] Hold on, hold on.
[1044.94 → 1048.36] The new Sync phone from Sync Mobile.
[1048.68 → 1051.60] Great thing about the Sync phone, it has one button and one only.
[1051.92 → 1053.10] Let's say I want to call my mom.
[1053.74 → 1054.30] Press it on.
[1054.72 → 1056.32] Open both the antennas.
[1056.48 → 1059.46] For better reception than the number 555.
[1060.02 → 1060.44] Five.
[1062.02 → 1062.50] Five.
[1063.50 → 1063.90] Oh.
[1065.90 → 1068.08] Simply press no times for zero.
[1069.38 → 1070.28] Have you seen this?
[1070.28 → 1070.78] No.
[1070.78 → 1071.04] Five.
[1073.52 → 1074.36] And then...
[1074.36 → 1080.42] And the best feature of the Sync phone, you cannot receive calls with it.
[1080.58 → 1082.36] You can only make calls.
[1082.58 → 1084.02] You'll never be bothered again at work.
[1084.26 → 1086.32] Your leisure time out in the golf course or at the beach.
[1087.58 → 1089.54] So, is that your phone?
[1089.70 → 1091.66] Like, is that the point we're at right now?
[1091.74 → 1093.84] That doesn't solve any of my problems at all.
[1093.90 → 1094.50] No, no, no.
[1094.64 → 1096.00] They didn't even talk about battery life.
[1096.00 → 1103.88] Speaking of not solving problems, Nintendo to halt console and software distribution in Brazil.
[1104.34 → 1107.70] So, this article is from digitalspy.co.uk.
[1107.90 → 1110.92] I'm going to go ahead and post that in the chat here.
[1111.44 → 1113.74] And what a bummer for Brazilians.
[1113.96 → 1114.44] Yeah, really.
[1114.44 → 1115.74] Like, just...
[1115.74 → 1120.48] I don't blame Nintendo for this at all.
[1120.62 → 1120.80] Yeah.
[1121.02 → 1125.34] And, like, it's not like they're like, oh, we're never going to be distributing in Brazil.
[1125.48 → 1127.74] They're just talking about how they're having issues with it right now.
[1128.12 → 1130.34] I'm assuming they're going to try and fix those issues and then come back.
[1130.34 → 1149.40] So, basically, they and their Brazilian distributor, who is apparently still handling distribution for that area, just not in Brazil specifically, have both said, yeah, like, we still have a relationship, and we're committed to re-evaluating things as time goes on.
[1149.88 → 1153.44] But, basically, due to the...
[1153.44 → 1156.60] And, apparently, there are other issues as well that they're not really getting into.
[1156.60 → 1166.68] But, they're saying the distribution model in the country is unsustainable and most of this is thanks to the extremely high import tariffs on anything that's manufactured outside of Brazil.
[1166.84 → 1178.58] Now, this is something that the Brazilian government did a number of years back to, I guess, incentivize companies to make their own manufacturing facilities within Brazil.
[1178.58 → 1187.48] Because, if you make something in Brazil, whether it's a car or a PlayStation 4, if you make something within the country, it's not subject to those tariffs.
[1187.58 → 1191.68] And, I can understand why they might want to do this from a job creation perspective.
[1191.98 → 1192.12] Did you like this?
[1192.50 → 1193.12] I'm sorry?
[1193.22 → 1193.80] Did you like this?
[1193.82 → 1193.90] Yeah.
[1194.26 → 1200.36] And, also, to encourage foreign investment into, you know, high technology manufacturing facilities within Brazil.
[1200.36 → 1204.18] But, the reality of it is, Brazil is just Brazil.
[1204.78 → 1211.78] And, setting up new manufacturing in, you know, if every country started doing this, and you had to set up manufacturing in every single country,
[1211.88 → 1216.76] not only would it drive up the cost of that product within that country, it would drive it up everywhere.
[1216.76 → 1218.74] Because, it creates all this overhead for these companies.
[1218.96 → 1226.76] So, I mean, to put this in perspective, like, people might be going, well, you know, there's import tax in the UK and in Canada and everywhere.
[1226.76 → 1239.06] But, to put it in perspective, the $400 PlayStation 4, this is from the Digitalspy.ca article, was priced at $1,800 after import fees when it arrived in Brazil.
[1239.24 → 1240.12] And, that's converted.
[1240.26 → 1243.08] That's not in Brazilian dollars or anything like that.
[1243.16 → 1246.16] That's just, that's a straight currency conversion.
[1246.16 → 1259.26] I mean, it's not like, it's not like Brazil is Dubai, where you might expect the average resident to be able to afford to pay four plus times more than, you know, anyone else in the world.
[1259.44 → 1260.72] And, obviously, I'm generalizing.
[1260.80 → 1262.66] I know not everyone in Dubai is loaded.
[1263.08 → 1271.12] But, the point is, it's not like Brazil is an extraordinarily wealthy country where everyone is going to be walking around with two grand to drop on a game console.
[1271.12 → 1274.72] And, then, you know, over $100 per game, I mean, that's ridiculous.
[1276.74 → 1279.70] So, basically, yeah, they're going to re-evaluate.
[1280.18 → 1280.92] And, I hope...
[1280.92 → 1282.24] It really sucks for people in Brazil.
[1282.60 → 1283.26] It really does.
[1283.34 → 1285.88] Because, now, how are they going to get them?
[1285.92 → 1288.12] The only other option is going to be...
[1289.00 → 1294.60] I'm like, okay, how does it work if you bought something on, like, Amazon.com and got it shipped to you?
[1294.72 → 1295.22] Yeah, same thing.
[1295.30 → 1296.12] The import tariffs will still...
[1296.12 → 1297.22] You get hit by import tariffs?
[1297.24 → 1297.50] Yeah.
[1297.68 → 1298.28] Yeah, absolutely.
[1299.24 → 1299.60] Rough.
[1299.60 → 1303.36] All right, so this is from Hexis.net.
[1303.50 → 1305.08] I'm just going to go ahead and...
[1305.08 → 1305.30] I got it.
[1305.42 → 1305.88] You got it?
[1305.92 → 1306.74] Yeah, SSDs.
[1306.82 → 1307.00] Yeah.
[1307.42 → 1309.06] This is from Hexis.net.
[1309.50 → 1323.00] And, a report on the state of flash memory and disk storage has predicted that using SSDs will become more economical than hard drives for most purposes from 2016 onward.
[1323.00 → 1330.38] The prediction applies to almost all storage, but seems like the highest capacities will remain the forte of spinning disks for a little bit longer.
[1331.54 → 1337.98] Wilkison followed up its 2009 report with another recently focusing on evolution of all flash array architectures.
[1338.40 → 1339.86] Ah, blip pity-bloopity-bloopity-bloop.
[1339.86 → 1346.92] So, this one right here shows four-year cost per terabyte for capacity disks and NAND flash.
[1346.92 → 1349.30] So, they figure in 2016...
[1349.30 → 1355.68] So, between 2015 and the beginning of 2016, we're going to go from flash costing, you know...
[1355.68 → 1356.62] Ah, let's see.
[1356.74 → 1358.06] I'm on a scale of this here.
[1358.20 → 1358.68] So, whatever.
[1358.84 → 1363.40] 40% more all the way down to only...
[1363.40 → 1364.84] Wow, less than half.
[1364.88 → 1365.84] It's a massive drop.
[1365.84 → 1366.36] Yeah.
[1366.82 → 1374.76] So, for one thing, I haven't really seen this exact ratio at this time.
[1374.90 → 1377.06] So, they're assuming that'll happen in 2015.
[1377.74 → 1379.28] So, good luck.
[1379.40 → 1385.48] And, two, talking to a couple SSD makers at CES, they kind of went, 2016?
[1385.68 → 1386.22] Are you high?
[1387.54 → 1389.34] We're a long way away.
[1390.26 → 1397.88] And, you look at the difficulty that even Intel has had moving to 14 nanometers, although we haven't seen any indication that 10 nanometre is going to slip.
[1398.68 → 1401.48] But, yeah.
[1402.96 → 1404.22] It would be great.
[1404.44 → 1404.74] It's kind of insane.
[1405.04 → 1408.90] Like, at the same time, I just had the problem where my SSD completely died.
[1409.26 → 1409.56] Mm-hmm.
[1410.22 → 1417.06] And, while, alright, SSD failure rates are actually perfect, the problem is not really recoverable.
[1417.06 → 1420.70] So, I'm still going to want to have most of my mass storage on hard disk anyway.
[1420.88 → 1422.10] That's actually a very good point.
[1422.22 → 1427.42] Not something that I thought about when it comes to mass storage.
[1427.58 → 1431.88] Being able to buy, like, a terabyte SSD for my boot drive, sweet.
[1432.42 → 1435.30] And have it be, like, totally affordable, like, that's awesome.
[1435.44 → 1436.56] I totally want to be able to do that.
[1436.60 → 1437.80] You're still not going to archive on it.
[1437.84 → 1439.00] I'm still not going to archive on it.
[1439.12 → 1439.38] Right.
[1439.54 → 1440.06] Not at all.
[1440.20 → 1440.80] There's no way.
[1440.98 → 1442.88] My NAS will be running hard disks.
[1442.88 → 1446.24] Unless something super major changes.
[1446.40 → 1447.30] But, I seriously doubt it.
[1447.38 → 1453.02] Because, that way, if there is a huge failure, I can just be like, okay, well, I can probably scrub data off this.
[1453.34 → 1453.82] That's a good point.
[1453.86 → 1456.16] Because, I hate running hard drives on anything portable.
[1456.50 → 1458.88] Like, I thought iPods were insane.
[1459.10 → 1459.42] Yeah.
[1459.56 → 1460.38] When they had hard drives.
[1460.50 → 1461.32] And, I was like, what are you?
[1461.40 → 1463.74] Are you just hitting the bottle?
[1463.76 → 1464.92] Are you asking for this to die?
[1464.92 → 1469.14] Like, I was one of those freaks that bought an RCA Lyra.
[1470.12 → 1470.48] Because.
[1470.94 → 1474.10] I bought a Zen Creative some other stuff.
[1474.32 → 1475.22] Because it wasn't a hard drive.
[1475.38 → 1475.52] Yeah.
[1475.52 → 1476.20] I don't remember what it was called.
[1476.20 → 1478.68] I paid way too much for my Lyra.
[1479.22 → 1483.42] But, and it only had, I think, I had one and my girlfriend at the time had one.
[1483.46 → 1484.86] One of us had a 64 Meg.
[1485.32 → 1486.48] And the other one had a 32 Meg.
[1486.48 → 1491.18] So, we're talking, like, 10 to 20 MP3 music files on this thing.
[1491.40 → 1492.40] I miss those things.
[1492.40 → 1495.54] But, I was like, okay, but, but, but.
[1495.82 → 1498.72] And, and so, that was, like, compared to people with iPods, right?
[1499.08 → 1501.04] But, there was a justification behind this.
[1501.08 → 1502.94] So, number one is it wasn't a hard drive based.
[1503.14 → 1506.24] So, flash storage, yay, throw it around and all that's good.
[1506.46 → 1511.00] And, number two is that at the time, I was using a Sony Disc man anyway.
[1511.44 → 1518.22] So, when you're burning yourself a mix CD, that's only going to be about, you know, 16 to 22 songs.
[1518.22 → 1522.60] Because you didn't have MP3 CDs at the time, where you could just burn the files to it.
[1522.72 → 1525.36] So, you were only going to have about 20 songs on a disc anyway.
[1525.44 → 1530.42] So, I was like, okay, well, this thing is the equivalent of whatever mix CD that I would be burning for myself.
[1530.54 → 1531.90] And, yeah, it's a couple of hundred bucks or whatever.
[1532.08 → 1534.24] But, at least it's, at least it's pretty rugged.
[1534.68 → 1538.22] I used to, I used to love the days of, like, alright, I have woken up.
[1538.36 → 1541.18] Time to change what songs are on my MP3 player.
[1541.18 → 1543.32] Because I can only hold one album worth at a time.
[1544.76 → 1546.02] That was always entertaining.
[1546.56 → 1551.52] But, yeah, I don't see myself changing archival storage mediums for a very long time.
[1551.86 → 1555.88] On the subject of archival storage mediums, this is fascinating.
[1556.16 → 1557.32] Maybe I just haven't been paying attention.
[1557.64 → 1560.92] We haven't been saying who's been posting articles in the forum.
[1561.00 → 1561.54] We're bad people.
[1561.68 → 1563.20] It was shanny for the esports' thing.
[1563.28 → 1566.92] Goodbyes, shout out to you for the Google not patching the security hole thing.
[1567.06 → 1569.28] Opcode for something.
[1569.28 → 1571.70] X-Tank Slayer X for Nintendo to halt console.
[1572.60 → 1574.30] And, ah, oh, no, okay, that was it.
[1574.42 → 1576.88] Okay, so this one's by Ah Ming.
[1577.34 → 1581.64] New service allows you to rent your hard disk space.
[1582.12 → 1583.52] Have you posted the article already?
[1583.92 → 1585.10] Okay, awesome.
[1585.20 → 1588.70] I'm going to go ahead and pull up the myce.com article here.
[1588.78 → 1595.56] But it's called Storage, and it's spelled wrong because that's the hipster Web 2.0 thing to do.
[1596.52 → 1598.20] Yeah, like the Racer Siren.
[1598.20 → 1599.96] It's like, what are you guys doing?
[1600.68 → 1603.84] It's like you're celebrities, and you're naming your children or something.
[1604.38 → 1609.88] So, storage, S-T-O-R-J dot I-O is where you can go to learn about this.
[1610.04 → 1613.50] And it sounds really cool on the surface.
[1613.50 → 1619.34] Last year, they raised about $215,000 in Bitcoins.
[1619.50 → 1625.74] Apparently, according to this article, that's using today's Bitcoin valuation.
[1625.96 → 1633.08] So, at the time, if they converted them promptly, then that was actually a lot more money.
[1633.08 → 1640.06] But the way it's going to work is it's a peer-to-peer network that allows you to allocate storage on your computer.
[1640.52 → 1643.68] So, on your hard drive or SSD, whatever the case may be.
[1643.84 → 1646.44] And go, okay, yeah, I've got 300 gigs of storage I'm not using.
[1646.64 → 1654.32] And then it actually gives you that much storage space elsewhere on the network to use as cloud-based storage.
[1654.58 → 1654.66] Yeah.
[1655.48 → 1656.48] Very, very cool.
[1656.64 → 1657.96] And then, sorry, go ahead.
[1658.08 → 1659.94] There are other ways you can utilize this too.
[1660.04 → 1662.64] I believe you can request more, but then you have to pay for it.
[1662.64 → 1662.86] Yes.
[1663.00 → 1665.06] And then other people can kind of rent out their space.
[1665.16 → 1665.42] Yes.
[1665.64 → 1665.80] Yeah.
[1665.98 → 1667.74] So, that's pretty cool.
[1667.92 → 1673.96] One quick thing to note about the rent out your space is you get paid in, I don't remember exactly what it's called,
[1673.96 → 1676.52] but it's like storage I.O. coin.
[1677.60 → 1679.40] Storage Coin X.
[1679.60 → 1679.82] Yeah.
[1679.82 → 1684.28] A digital valuate, valuate?
[1684.60 → 1685.58] I haven't seen this word before.
[1685.68 → 1686.30] I'm going to call it currency.
[1686.30 → 1686.32] Currency.
[1686.70 → 1686.84] Yeah.
[1687.00 → 1688.90] Which can be exchanged for real money.
[1689.58 → 1689.90] Yeah.
[1690.06 → 1693.54] So, you don't actually get paid to, like, your PayPal in dollars.
[1694.76 → 1696.14] You get paid in this thing.
[1696.52 → 1698.84] So, you can figure that out, convert it or whatever.
[1699.08 → 1699.88] But, I mean, think about it.
[1699.88 → 1706.52] Like, if you planned to use this service in the long term, you could go ahead and invest in a large rate array or something like that.
[1706.52 → 1709.92] You could rent out until you fill it.
[1710.28 → 1721.18] And then you could start using your storage, like, your built-up storage currency to rent from other people until you can save up some money in order to, you know, buy a new rate array or whatever else.
[1721.22 → 1725.74] Like, I can see this being a really, really cool way to get the most out of your personal storage.
[1725.96 → 1730.36] The most thing to remember is that current cloud-based storage is not that expensive.
[1730.70 → 1731.16] That's true.
[1731.30 → 1731.76] To be completely honest.
[1732.32 → 1732.76] And this is supposed to be...
[1732.76 → 1733.48] It's not that cheap.
[1733.96 → 1734.20] Nope.
[1734.20 → 1735.76] This is supposed to be a lot cheaper.
[1736.42 → 1738.02] So, you're probably not...
[1738.02 → 1741.78] And then after their cuts and stuff, you're probably not going to get a ton for renting out your space.
[1741.96 → 1745.56] But if you weren't using it anyway, then that's still cool.
[1745.92 → 1755.48] And you might actually be able to theoretically make more money off of renting your hard drive space, use a lot less power compared to running Bitcoin miners.
[1755.96 → 1756.20] Right.
[1756.42 → 1757.46] Which would be kind of funny.
[1757.46 → 1760.74] And, I mean, one way to look at it, too, is you're...
[1760.74 → 1763.68] It's more like storage shifting, almost, at a certain point.
[1763.68 → 1763.90] Yeah.
[1763.90 → 1773.32] Because you could kind of go, yeah, I don't need all this space I have on my desktop computer, which I hardly ever touch anymore because I'm always running around with my notebook or my smartphone or whatever else.
[1773.32 → 1776.98] But you're converting that to cloud storage that you can use with your smartphone.
[1777.14 → 1777.52] Pretty cool.
[1777.52 → 1782.04] And so the way it works is it actually breaks up blocks.
[1782.30 → 1787.56] And those are either 32 Meg or 8 Meg, if I recall correctly.
[1787.82 → 1789.44] Yeah, 8 Meg or 32 Meg blocks.
[1789.86 → 1793.02] And then it actually distributes everything all over the place.
[1793.26 → 1795.92] So aside from encrypting them, you shouldn't...
[1795.92 → 1804.04] Like, one person's hard drive, aside from having an encrypted version of your data, shouldn't even have the entire piece of data in many cases.
[1804.52 → 1806.70] So it's, in theory, secure.
[1806.90 → 1808.56] I'm not endorsing its security.
[1808.94 → 1809.16] Yeah.
[1809.26 → 1810.48] Let's be really clear about that.
[1810.56 → 1812.22] This is something I hadn't heard of up until now.
[1812.46 → 1816.54] And there is definitely a gray zone here.
[1816.74 → 1820.80] So each block, each block of data has a unique hash.
[1820.80 → 1825.12] It should be possible to add illegal content to a so-called gray list.
[1825.26 → 1832.70] And then it should be possible for users to allow or disallow gray list content to be stored on their hard drive.
[1832.70 → 1838.86] Because this creates a huge, a huge liability concern.
[1839.10 → 1845.12] Like, what if I get raided because my hard drive has a bunch of child porn on it?
[1845.16 → 1846.40] Like, let's go worst case scenario.
[1846.40 → 1850.34] It's got a bunch of child porn on it that I didn't even know was there and was encrypted.
[1850.34 → 1854.46] So I didn't even have any way of discovering that it was there.
[1855.42 → 1858.58] And so, probably?
[1858.84 → 1859.68] And then the other way around.
[1859.90 → 1860.90] And then the other way around.
[1861.00 → 1865.28] What if you use this maliciously to try and take blame off of yourself for doing something like that?
[1865.70 → 1867.04] So, yeah.
[1867.16 → 1869.08] And it'll use your bandwidth, of course.
[1869.22 → 1872.10] Because the way it works is its kind of a it's a mesh-based network.
[1872.10 → 1876.92] So, in order to keep speeds high, you're actually pulling from multiple sources.
[1876.92 → 1878.50] And in much the same way.
[1878.50 → 1880.62] Um, like, just like, just like tormenting.
[1880.62 → 1885.64] You would be, you would have multiple seeds, including yourself, uploading files to other people at the same time.
[1885.64 → 1887.70] So, very cool idea.
[1887.70 → 1890.84] I might consider, you know, giving it a try.
[1890.84 → 1893.00] It would be, it's a very interesting thing.
[1893.22 → 1894.72] I'd be interested in giving it a try, too.
[1894.80 → 1897.38] I'm definitely not going to check off that grey content thing.
[1897.50 → 1898.46] I'd definitely not.
[1898.70 → 1899.10] Um.
[1899.28 → 1900.52] Even though it might not even help.
[1900.62 → 1902.88] Because I don't know how they're flagging grey content.
[1903.06 → 1904.32] But I'm sure it's not very effective.
[1904.44 → 1904.64] Yeah.
[1904.88 → 1907.28] I'm sure it's not going to capture stuff like child porn.
[1907.66 → 1910.00] I'm sure if it captured anything, it would be stuffed like movies.
[1910.00 → 1911.48] Used read the file name.
[1911.92 → 1913.18] It's not very effective.
[1913.18 → 1916.66] Called JPEG 1.
[1917.18 → 1917.96] Didn't work.
[1918.62 → 1918.84] Uh.
[1919.60 → 1920.08] Uh.
[1920.08 → 1922.00] But yeah, I'm sure it's more for, like, movies.
[1923.28 → 1924.14] More Nintendo BS.
[1924.14 → 1926.68] Oh, does this file match Iron Man 4?
[1927.10 → 1927.52] Oh, okay.
[1927.62 → 1928.56] Well, you can't have it.
[1928.94 → 1930.12] More Nintendo BS.
[1930.70 → 1930.78] Uh.
[1930.78 → 1935.18] Nintendo is no longer including in the new DS XL.
[1935.34 → 1935.94] Excuse me.
[1936.06 → 1937.02] 3DS XL.
[1937.14 → 1937.96] They're not the same thing as that.
[1937.96 → 1939.02] This time it's their fault.
[1939.60 → 1940.08] Um.
[1940.56 → 1941.84] Like, really, guys?
[1941.84 → 1943.74] This time it's, like, super their fault.
[1943.78 → 1945.82] This was posted by Rohit Kumar SP.
[1946.08 → 1949.22] I'm going to go ahead and pull this up on, uh, pull this up on my computer here.
[1949.58 → 1954.56] But the, the new Nintendo 3DS XL does not come with an AC adapter.
[1954.72 → 1956.76] Nintendo says there's a good reason for that.
[1957.14 → 1963.24] And that's that rather than to raise the cost of the 3DS XL by charging consumers for a component
[1963.24 → 1969.10] they may already own, we are giving them the option to only buy it if they need an AC adapter.
[1969.10 → 1972.04] And that is an interesting argument.
[1972.04 → 1978.84] And you could probably make that argument for something like a smartphone that uses micro USB
[1978.84 → 1985.82] instead of a proprietary connector that they haven't even been using for that long.
[1985.88 → 1988.86] I mean, if you're a DS Lite owner, that's not going to work.
[1989.26 → 1991.06] So, Nintendo.
[1991.06 → 1991.46] Nintendo.
[1992.18 → 1992.54] Uh.
[1992.62 → 1994.48] And apparently it's an $8 adder.
[1994.60 → 1998.70] Although Luke was saying that when he saw them in the store, they were significantly more
[1998.70 → 1999.04] than that.
[1999.04 → 1999.10] Yeah.
[1999.28 → 2001.22] Well, it's an $8 from Nintendo.
[2001.44 → 2003.96] If you buy it from a brick and mortar or something, it could be more expensive.
[2004.44 → 2007.88] I mean, can you imagine getting, giving that to someone for Christmas?
[2007.88 → 2012.52] There are stories in the news article about people that bought it for Christmas for their kid
[2012.52 → 2013.30] with a game.
[2013.44 → 2018.08] The kid opened both of them and was like, oh crap, because this is already a thing in
[2018.08 → 2019.78] certain Asian markets.
[2019.80 → 2021.90] I think Europe and Japan for sure.
[2022.06 → 2022.18] Yeah.
[2022.32 → 2022.44] Yeah.
[2023.04 → 2026.04] So, like, it's already a thing in places and people are already upset about it.
[2026.08 → 2028.54] People are going, well, like, you don't do this in the States.
[2028.88 → 2031.86] So, their decision was to also do it in the States?
[2031.96 → 2033.94] That's not how you solve that problem.
[2034.38 → 2035.18] Oh my goodness.
[2035.18 → 2042.48] You just stop doing it everywhere because, like, okay, I've owned iterations of DS where...
[2042.48 → 2043.62] You've got a 2DS now, right?
[2043.70 → 2043.88] Yeah.
[2043.96 → 2044.10] Yeah.
[2044.16 → 2046.44] Where if I bought this new one, it would be fine.
[2046.70 → 2051.58] But if I bought the new one, I would give my 2DS to someone with the charger.
[2051.96 → 2052.82] And not everyone...
[2052.82 → 2053.28] Because that makes sense.
[2053.32 → 2057.52] Not everyone is branded and just buys half a dozen charging cables for everything they
[2057.52 → 2057.64] own.
[2057.74 → 2057.88] Yeah.
[2058.14 → 2063.08] And another simple solution here would be for Nintendo to stop using a proprietary Direction.
[2063.08 → 2063.30] Yes.
[2063.30 → 2064.78] It's just a 5-volt power source.
[2064.92 → 2065.06] Yeah.
[2065.06 → 2068.16] There is absolutely no reason on earth...
[2068.16 → 2069.10] I thought it was Mini.
[2069.58 → 2070.56] It looks like Mini.
[2070.66 → 2072.08] When I had a...
[2072.08 → 2072.68] What was it?
[2072.78 → 2073.44] My DS Lite.
[2073.54 → 2074.72] So, admittedly, a different connector.
[2074.94 → 2076.16] I thought it was Mini.
[2076.26 → 2080.26] So, I lost my charger for a while and then just went and found a Mini cable and was like,
[2081.06 → 2081.78] why doesn't it work?
[2082.58 → 2083.30] What's wrong?
[2083.76 → 2085.26] I was like, what is this?
[2086.36 → 2086.58] Oh.
[2086.58 → 2088.68] So, there's new MacBook Air rumours.
[2088.68 → 2089.18] So, there's new MacBook Air rumours.
[2089.18 → 2092.46] And there are conflicting reports.
[2092.56 → 2097.08] I was hearing for a while that they were going to do away with the Maggot connector, their magnetic
[2097.08 → 2097.90] charging cable.
[2098.38 → 2099.58] I was hearing...
[2099.58 → 2102.60] So, this is the most recent version.
[2102.60 → 2112.42] So, it's rumoured that it will be so thin that it will not have room for a 3.5mm audio jack, which is absolutely ridiculous.
[2113.70 → 2114.98] I cannot...
[2114.98 → 2117.70] I cannot imagine Apple being...
[2117.70 → 2119.40] I shouldn't say that.
[2119.84 → 2123.14] I truly hope Apple wouldn't be that stupid.
[2124.20 → 2127.72] So stupid as to remove the 3.5mm connector.
[2127.86 → 2135.32] Maybe the justification is, you know, we're going to have an awesome new Bluetooth Beats headphone or something like that.
[2135.36 → 2136.66] But that is ridiculous.
[2138.60 → 2139.64] So, there's other stuff.
[2139.84 → 2141.50] It will apparently have a Retina screen.
[2141.76 → 2142.24] Burr.
[2142.42 → 2143.60] It's a 12-inch.
[2143.70 → 2144.66] It's going to be super thin.
[2144.66 → 2147.58] It's allegedly going to have a fanless design.
[2148.04 → 2153.56] So, so far, it actually sounds very similar to the Zen Book UX305 that we checked out at CES,
[2153.70 → 2161.86] which is also extraordinarily thin, has a 3200 by 1800 pixel display, is fanless, which is cool,
[2161.98 → 2167.00] and features a Bradwell M processor, which is what allows it to be fanless and still deliver decent performance.
[2167.70 → 2173.28] So, the new MacBook Air will apparently have a USB 3.1 interface rather than Thunderbolt.
[2173.84 → 2174.10] Oh.
[2174.10 → 2181.48] Which is fascinating to me because Apple's been the only one that really has glommed onto the Thunderbolt standard.
[2181.48 → 2185.78] And many Mac people are already invested into the Thunderbolt ecosystem.
[2186.00 → 2196.36] Now, bear in mind, USB 3.1 at 10 gigabits per second is, and with up to 100 watts of power output, is a very capable, capable connector.
[2197.08 → 2198.76] But, um...
[2198.76 → 2200.02] It's still a little weird.
[2200.02 → 2202.64] It's still pretty bizarre to me because...
[2202.64 → 2208.18] And the footprint of a USB 3.1 A plug is actually quite large.
[2208.28 → 2210.54] They might have been able to get two Thunderbolt plugs in that area.
[2210.84 → 2212.20] Yeah, and this picture shows...
[2212.90 → 2214.06] What looks like a Thunderbolt plug.
[2214.06 → 2216.72] Shows an A connector and also shows what appears to be a Thunderbolt connector.
[2216.82 → 2218.32] But this might be an older one or something.
[2218.50 → 2218.76] That's true.
[2218.76 → 2218.96] Yeah, sure.
[2219.32 → 2221.56] The rumours are kind of all over the place right now.
[2221.62 → 2228.90] But one challenge right off the bat, although USB 3.1 should address this with display over USB being much easier,
[2228.90 → 2232.66] is that people are not necessarily going to be set up.
[2232.72 → 2236.76] But then again, I was going to say, set up with all the, you know, cables and everything that they need.
[2236.80 → 2241.78] But then Apple's never been ashamed of charging you $60 for a cable with your MacBook anyway.
[2242.06 → 2242.28] No, no.
[2242.74 → 2244.04] Who knows what they're going to do?
[2244.12 → 2250.50] But I know for sure that I want to check out the UX305, that Zen Book from Asus, because that one looks outstanding.
[2250.84 → 2250.98] Yeah.
[2250.98 → 2256.02] Bradwell, while not exciting on the desktop, looks like it's going to be...
[2256.02 → 2256.70] Super cool on laptop.
[2257.04 → 2258.42] Really cool on laptop.
[2258.58 → 2258.72] Yeah.
[2258.72 → 2259.76] Really cool on notebook.
[2259.90 → 2267.44] Did you see the 12.5-inch Asus, like, super thin Transformer Book Qi T300 tablet?
[2267.56 → 2269.62] No, I was checking out all the Lenovo stuff.
[2269.80 → 2276.58] They have a lot of really cool yogas, which are super crazy thin yogas that are basically as thin as tablets when you fold them.
[2277.20 → 2279.22] A yoga could win me over.
[2279.22 → 2286.54] I'm really disappointed that Dell kind of abandoned the Ferris wheel design for their convertibles.
[2287.38 → 2291.42] Because, I mean, the new XPS 13, we do have a review unit coming, and I am going to check it out.
[2291.52 → 2296.12] It does look pretty awesome, but I really, really wish it was a two-in-one.
[2296.30 → 2300.68] Because even though I use the tablet functionality of this, only very rarely.
[2301.30 → 2302.02] It's still nice.
[2302.12 → 2308.66] It's nice to have, and the hinge mechanism has been robust enough that it hasn't been a problem for me at all.
[2308.66 → 2312.38] And I don't mind the extra thickness in order to have that.
[2312.50 → 2314.90] So I would have liked to still have that opportunity.
[2315.00 → 2321.64] The other thing I'm really disappointed about, and I'm already planning to rip into Dell about for a good minute of the review,
[2321.88 → 2324.92] is that the top-end SKU has only 8 gigs of RAM.
[2325.24 → 2325.48] Yeah.
[2326.32 → 2326.76] Really?
[2326.76 → 2332.00] It's like they want me to only get a year out of my XPS 13.
[2332.14 → 2336.60] 8 gigs of RAM is like, when I'm like, yeah, buy this kit so you can upgrade later.
[2336.94 → 2337.14] Yeah.
[2337.14 → 2339.86] All right.
[2340.86 → 2344.94] AMD employee confirms new GPU with HBM.
[2345.72 → 2352.60] So HBM, or High Bandwidth Memory, is a stacked RAM technology co-developed by AMD and SK Hynix,
[2353.00 → 2357.20] similar to Hybrid Memory Cube, which is something that Micron was working on,
[2357.32 → 2362.66] and that NVIDIA was backing, and had planned to release a GPU with this year.
[2362.66 → 2369.02] But since NVIDIA bet wrong, it looks like they're going to be stuck with GDDR5 until 2016,
[2369.72 → 2375.38] when they are going to be apparently jumping on the HBM bandwagon as well.
[2375.60 → 2377.30] So why do we need HBM?
[2377.54 → 2379.04] Well, there are a couple of good reasons.
[2379.32 → 2380.42] Dramatically better bandwidth.
[2380.42 → 2386.10] We're talking on the order of four and a half times right from the start.
[2386.64 → 2392.90] And higher bandwidth is good, not only because it allows the GPU to transfer data extremely quickly
[2392.90 → 2395.70] from its video memory and to its video memory,
[2395.82 → 2401.04] but also because it simplifies the design of the chips and the PCBs,
[2401.12 → 2405.24] lowering the cost of the graphics card for the end user, in theory.
[2405.40 → 2405.88] Probably not.
[2405.98 → 2407.20] Probably they'll just take more margin on it.
[2407.20 → 2408.00] But you know how it is.
[2408.30 → 2411.50] In the very long term, it will drive costs down,
[2411.56 → 2418.62] because if you don't have to have these massive 384-bit, 512-bit designs,
[2418.88 → 2421.02] that's a lot of pins on the bottom of the GPU.
[2421.18 → 2423.52] That's a lot of memory modules, and that's a lot of traces.
[2423.82 → 2426.20] Then it does lower the cost significantly.
[2427.22 → 2428.88] So there's that.
[2429.28 → 2432.44] Oh, the rumoured R9 380X will include it.
[2432.44 → 2437.56] That is supposed to be a 20 nanometre GPU and due sometime in the next few months here.
[2438.26 → 2443.24] The R9 390X is also rumoured and is rumoured to come with water cooling from the factory,
[2443.86 → 2447.62] just like the wow, I'm drawing a blank, R9 295X2.
[2448.58 → 2450.00] And I think that's pretty much it.
[2450.06 → 2452.82] It should be noted that our source for this is WCCF Tech.
[2452.82 → 2456.88] So I'm saying that at the end, so everyone wouldn't just tune out immediately.
[2457.38 → 2462.42] And most of this stuff looks pretty credible and does align with stuff that we've heard already.
[2462.58 → 2469.38] And the fact that the source for some of this info, at least, was the LinkedIn pages of AMD employees,
[2469.94 → 2474.82] one of which seems to have been made at least not public, because I couldn't see it at this point,
[2475.30 → 2477.26] looks like it could be pretty credible.
[2477.66 → 2477.76] Yeah.
[2477.76 → 2481.16] And it's not like HBM has been a secret.
[2481.34 → 2484.10] Unix has been sampling it since late last year.
[2484.40 → 2484.56] Yeah.
[2484.68 → 2485.86] So it's been available.
[2486.58 → 2488.60] I'm pretty excited to see what that brings.
[2488.84 → 2494.50] NVIDIA may end up in a position where, for the first time in a while,
[2494.96 → 2500.62] they have maybe a performance competitive part, but perhaps not a cost competitive part,
[2500.62 → 2504.66] and they might have to give up some of those juicy margins they've been making for the last couple of years.
[2504.66 → 2508.74] Because Titan X, which is what the internet is kind of calling it now,
[2509.16 → 2518.70] the fully enabled Maxwell that should power Tesla, Squadron, and then very high-end Titan-grade GPUs on the desktop,
[2519.40 → 2521.30] is still out there.
[2521.64 → 2525.80] We don't know too much about it, other than that it'll apparently have around 3,000 CUBA cores.
[2525.80 → 2530.56] But it's going to be a really large die, and therefore very expensive to produce,
[2530.64 → 2536.62] since NVIDIA had planned to skip 20 nanometers and instead go straight to 16 nanometers,
[2536.92 → 2540.32] except that that's been delayed by TSMC due to difficulties.
[2540.56 → 2541.98] And Samsung as well, for that matter.
[2542.06 → 2546.44] Intel's the only one with working 1X class nanometre manufacturing right now,
[2546.48 → 2549.70] and I don't think Intel's going to run around making GPUs for NVIDIA anytime soon.
[2549.70 → 2552.22] Although maybe.
[2552.46 → 2554.48] That would be a fascinating collab.
[2555.60 → 2557.84] I seriously don't think it would happen.
[2557.98 → 2558.82] Totally not happening.
[2559.14 → 2562.82] Intel always reserves their best for themselves, and apparently Apple.
[2563.24 → 2563.44] Yeah.
[2564.16 → 2566.82] So that was rumoured a couple of weeks ago, I think.
[2567.66 → 2570.06] But, hmm.
[2570.52 → 2571.60] Could be an interesting year.
[2571.70 → 2573.60] AMD might be able to fight back.
[2573.70 → 2574.82] I mean, Free Sync is a big one,
[2574.82 → 2579.00] because I've been blowing that G-Sync trumpet for a long time.
[2579.30 → 2582.54] Not because I love NVIDIA so buggy-muggy much,
[2582.60 → 2585.94] and I think they're just the cuddliest, most wonderfulest people ever,
[2586.00 → 2589.16] but because it's a legitimately much better gaming experience.
[2589.58 → 2591.46] And if Free Sync delivers on what it promises,
[2591.62 → 2595.46] and we're going to have Free Sync monitors coming into our office here soon,
[2595.80 → 2596.32] then...
[2596.32 → 2597.16] That'll be a cool showdown.
[2597.32 → 2599.56] I mean, what else is there?
[2599.68 → 2601.20] NVIDIA still has GeForce experience,
[2601.20 → 2602.48] which I personally don't use,
[2602.56 → 2604.64] because I have no problem configuring my in-game settings.
[2605.38 → 2606.86] Their 3D is much better,
[2607.08 → 2610.60] but stereo 3D is basically dead in the water at this point.
[2610.70 → 2611.58] And then multi-monitor.
[2611.76 → 2616.02] And then multi-monitor, I'd say AMD is going to have the edge there, yeah.
[2616.26 → 2619.06] So Free Sync could be a huge win for them,
[2619.16 → 2621.78] especially if monitor availability is as good as they're saying,
[2621.88 → 2624.78] with, I think it was 11 monitors now,
[2624.92 → 2626.78] and then up to 20 by the end of the year.
[2626.98 → 2627.70] Wow, that's solid.
[2628.04 → 2629.62] And talking to Asus,
[2630.38 → 2631.10] they were...
[2631.10 → 2632.52] It's funny, talking to them at CES,
[2632.52 → 2637.10] they actually weren't sure if their monitor that they know works with Free Sync
[2637.10 → 2638.92] was even going to work with it,
[2638.98 → 2642.96] because communication was kind of blew all over the place.
[2643.12 → 2646.94] But now, it's come out that even though that monitor is not Free Sync certified,
[2647.46 → 2651.64] there is no mandatory certification process or anything like that.
[2651.74 → 2655.84] So if Asus wants to have a Free Sync compatible monitor that's not certified,
[2656.04 → 2658.30] that's fine, and it'll work just fine.
[2658.36 → 2658.72] Interesting.
[2658.72 → 2659.78] Very cool.
[2659.90 → 2664.88] As long as the scalar technology and the firmware on the monitor both support the tech.
[2665.30 → 2665.92] Right, yeah, yeah.
[2666.04 → 2666.60] Cool, hey?
[2667.00 → 2667.58] That's interesting.
[2668.46 → 2668.90] All right.
[2668.98 → 2670.52] I wonder what the certification process is,
[2670.58 → 2675.10] because I still see buyer confidence being a little iffy if it's not actually certified.
[2675.34 → 2676.06] I think so too.
[2676.06 → 2680.64] And AMD, I believe, said that there's...
[2680.64 → 2682.78] Okay, I can't remember what they said about the fee structure,
[2682.96 → 2684.62] so basically don't quote me on this.
[2684.84 → 2687.10] But it was something along the lines of,
[2687.20 → 2690.44] they're not charging for a badge on the box,
[2691.04 → 2693.76] the way that NVIDIA has in the past with certain technologies,
[2693.88 → 2697.36] or the way that someone like MLG will charge BenQ,
[2697.48 → 2701.28] to have the MLG certified gaming monitor or whatever else.
[2701.28 → 2706.68] But I believe there would be a cost associated with the certification process,
[2706.86 → 2709.10] just because those things do cost money,
[2709.18 → 2712.36] because they would likely be done by a third party, not by AMD at all.
[2712.80 → 2713.92] Which is better.
[2714.08 → 2714.84] Which is life.
[2715.10 → 2715.30] Yeah.
[2715.50 → 2715.64] Yeah.
[2716.92 → 2717.32] Okay.
[2717.80 → 2720.04] Oh, should we do our sponsors for the day?
[2720.18 → 2721.62] That's probably not a bad idea.
[2721.82 → 2723.94] I love it when this works out like this.
[2724.06 → 2725.88] I'm wearing my Squarespace shirt today.
[2726.06 → 2726.26] There you go.
[2726.26 → 2727.68] It's so comfy.
[2728.20 → 2731.16] And it's American Apparel, and the printing on it is excellent.
[2731.32 → 2732.58] It still looks like the day I got it.
[2732.62 → 2733.28] I love this shirt.
[2733.48 → 2733.96] I know, I'm jealous.
[2733.98 → 2736.50] Squarespace.com, they make great shirts.
[2738.34 → 2739.96] Well, it's an American Apparel shirt.
[2740.12 → 2740.40] Yeah.
[2741.00 → 2742.12] They put their logos on great shirts.
[2742.12 → 2743.92] They put their logos on great shirts.
[2744.32 → 2747.66] And they put your logos on great websites.
[2747.82 → 2749.58] Squarespace.com is the...
[2749.58 → 2751.08] You put your logos on great websites.
[2751.34 → 2752.28] Yes, but they help you.
[2752.28 → 2756.56] They provide the platform that lets you put your logo on a great looking website.
[2756.80 → 2762.58] Squarespace makes it easy to design and build and host a gorgeous website that works great
[2762.58 → 2767.52] on a computer, works great on a tablet, works great on a smartphone, and scales appropriately,
[2767.88 → 2772.40] and just generally puts your best image forward when people visit your site.
[2772.44 → 2777.20] Whether it's for a store, or a blog, or just a, you know, hey, it's...
[2777.20 → 2779.80] This site is about me, and here's a picture of my cat.
[2779.90 → 2782.06] Squarespace has got you taken care of.
[2782.06 → 2785.00] And they even offer a lot of other services as well.
[2785.12 → 2789.20] So little things, like the fact that they have their logo creator, means that you can
[2789.20 → 2793.60] save your brand-new company a couple bucks, because that kind of stuff isn't cheap if
[2793.60 → 2797.10] you outsource it, by giving you something that might not be the unique thing in
[2797.10 → 2800.58] the world, but it's at least a functional logo right off the bat.
[2800.66 → 2804.06] They also allow you to have affordable images that are...
[2804.06 → 2804.50] Ah, shoot.
[2804.68 → 2805.24] Who was the...
[2805.24 → 2805.78] Getty Images.
[2806.06 → 2806.20] Yeah.
[2806.20 → 2809.40] Was the image service that they worked with, so that you can have beautiful images on your
[2809.40 → 2812.34] website instead of whatever it is that you created in MS Paint.
[2812.34 → 2818.06] Which, by the way, we'll be doing some MS Paint artwork on the after party for the custom
[2818.06 → 2821.38] forum badges that we owe some people from the Tip Starter campaign.
[2821.88 → 2823.34] And basically, it's...
[2823.34 → 2825.30] Yeah, what else is there that's really left to say?
[2825.30 → 2825.50] Right.
[2825.56 → 2831.04] If you buy a whole year at a time, then they throw in a basic cost domain, and they'll
[2831.04 → 2832.28] cover that for the first year.
[2832.74 → 2836.96] And it's got everything from simple tools to ones that even guys with some web development
[2836.96 → 2841.38] experience can really sink their teeth into to customize their viewer's experience.
[2841.72 → 2843.32] And yeah, basically, they're good guys.
[2843.40 → 2844.66] They've been sponsoring us a long time.
[2844.70 → 2848.18] And if you're looking to build a website, I can't think of anything that makes a...
[2848.18 → 2850.52] I can't think of anything that makes more sense in Squarespace.
[2850.52 → 2853.82] I was going to kind of qualify that statement.
[2853.96 → 2856.70] I was going to say, I can't think of anything that makes a lot more sense than Squarespace,
[2856.92 → 2857.52] but I legitimately...
[2858.62 → 2860.64] I can't think of anything that makes more sense than Squarespace.
[2860.78 → 2864.64] So visit squarespace.com slash Linus for a free trial and 10% off.
[2864.88 → 2865.02] Yeah.
[2865.38 → 2865.76] All right.
[2865.82 → 2868.52] Let's go on to our next sponsor today.
[2868.64 → 2869.24] Funny story.
[2870.04 → 2870.24] Yes.
[2870.38 → 2871.12] Before we move on.
[2871.30 → 2875.72] I have a friend that made a website on WordPress, and I'm probably going to be getting them
[2875.72 → 2880.20] a Squarespace account for them so that I can read their website on Squarespace because
[2880.20 → 2881.68] I'm highly frustrated with WordPress.
[2882.58 → 2883.96] Are they getting your help with it?
[2884.16 → 2885.00] Like, is that the problem?
[2885.42 → 2885.78] Ah.
[2885.92 → 2886.08] Yeah.
[2888.80 → 2890.38] That's why I've actually...
[2890.38 → 2891.90] You've been avoiding saying that.
[2892.46 → 2895.56] Throughout the time you've been talking about your friend's website, I was like, why does
[2895.56 → 2897.08] he keeps bringing up his friend's website?
[2898.44 → 2898.84] Yes.
[2899.64 → 2902.80] It's like the same thing where if I'm building someone's computer, sometimes I'll make them
[2902.80 → 2903.54] get a better case.
[2903.92 → 2904.26] Right.
[2904.26 → 2906.06] So I'm just like, I don't want to deal with this thing.
[2907.98 → 2908.38] Anyway.
[2908.72 → 2913.64] But if you don't want to ask Luke to help you with the coding for your website, boom,
[2913.84 → 2914.18] segue.
[2914.52 → 2915.94] There's lynda.com.
[2916.04 → 2921.80] lynda.com allows you to learn online, whether it's coding, digital photography, video editing,
[2922.18 → 2924.62] actually all like business, all kinds of cool stuff.
[2924.68 → 2929.86] Even if it's, you know, for a personal hobby or whether it's for, you know, developing new
[2929.86 → 2933.62] career options for yourself, lynda.com is a great way to learn online.
[2933.62 → 2938.60] They have new content added every week from industry experts, and you can do it completely

[2939.42 → 2940.24] I mean, oh, come on.
[2940.28 → 2941.20] Ultimately, what do they care?
[2941.40 → 2942.62] It's a monthly subscription.
[2942.84 → 2942.92] Yeah.
[2942.92 → 2944.42] Very affordably priced, by the way.
[2944.68 → 2945.44] Monthly subscriptions.
[2945.44 → 2949.12] So ultimately, you know, they're not going to, you know, put a bunch of pressure on you
[2949.12 → 2952.72] if deadline this and, you know, required exam that.
[2952.82 → 2957.06] No, they want you to learn at your own pace and just enjoy all the high quality content
[2957.06 → 2961.18] that they have in order to better yourself in whatever way it happens to be.

[2966.48 → 2968.86] So lynda.com, you guys are awesome.
[2969.00 → 2972.42] Viewers, you guys are awesome for learning and all that good stuff.
[2972.54 → 2973.94] And I think that's pretty much all there is to say.
[2974.04 → 2978.74] If you're not sure if lynda.com is right for you or if you just want to get some idea,
[2978.80 → 2981.84] well, you know, how high quality is the content?

[2990.50 → 2990.86] Hooray.
[2991.96 → 2992.36] Hooray.
[2992.94 → 2995.14] My Google Docs is freaking out right now.
[2995.20 → 2996.14] Anyway, what do you want to do next?
[2996.42 → 2996.94] I don't know.
[2997.04 → 2997.42] What should we do?
[2997.44 → 3000.26] Oh, let's do Grand Theft Auto 5 for PC delayed.
[3000.38 → 3002.92] This was posted by Werto165 on the forum.
[3003.42 → 3004.60] I'll go ahead and post the link.
[3004.66 → 3004.94] It's okay.
[3005.34 → 3005.52] Okay.
[3005.70 → 3006.48] I got this.
[3006.58 → 3007.00] Got this.
[3008.00 → 3010.20] So basically, the internet's freaking out.
[3010.20 → 3010.64] Yep.
[3010.64 → 3017.64] People are, bros be mad, and their butts hurt and all this kind of stuff.
[3018.38 → 3020.18] So it's been delayed several times.
[3020.64 → 3021.72] So there's that.
[3022.12 → 3024.38] Delayed again to the 24th of March.
[3024.76 → 3031.04] And what I have to say about all this is, A, screw you Rockstar for not at least trying
[3031.04 → 3036.78] to get the PC version out in a somewhat timely manner, like right near the PS4 and Xbox One
[3036.78 → 3037.80] versions at the very least.
[3037.80 → 3043.46] And two, screw you guys who are complaining about them delaying it because they've come
[3043.46 → 3048.96] right out and said it needs a few more weeks of testing and polish to make it as good as
[3048.96 → 3049.50] it can be.
[3049.60 → 3049.84] Yes.
[3049.96 → 3051.02] Please shut up.
[3051.12 → 3052.48] Just shut your mouth.
[3052.72 → 3052.94] God.
[3052.94 → 3055.18] They've said we're getting it.
[3055.76 → 3059.74] They're not just going console exclusive on it, which is something we could legitimately
[3059.74 → 3061.08] be mad about it.
[3061.08 → 3065.96] And they've said the reason we don't have it yet is that they want to port it properly.
[3065.96 → 3074.22] I mean, again, screw you Rockstar for opening up your pre-orders.
[3075.42 → 3080.38] And all of you guys, please don't pre-order it because we shouldn't be giving them money
[3080.38 → 3081.94] until they deliver it to us.
[3082.02 → 3086.66] But we also shouldn't be upset that they haven't delivered it to us yet if it's not ready yet.
[3086.72 → 3087.86] I'd rather have a finished game.
[3087.90 → 3088.28] And you know what?
[3088.28 → 3092.74] I've even seen people posting on Reddit and even in our forum, I thought I saw one of
[3092.74 → 3092.90] these.
[3093.22 → 3096.06] It's like, I'd rather have it have a few bugs and be playing it now.
[3096.70 → 3102.78] You would be saying the exact opposite thing if this was Assassin's Creed Unity or Watchdogs.
[3103.16 → 3105.28] Mind you, Watchdogs is full of a new thing.
[3105.52 → 3106.44] We have Far Cried come out.
[3106.50 → 3107.48] We have Watchdogs come out.
[3107.74 → 3108.26] Ubisoft.
[3108.44 → 3108.78] Hooray.
[3109.74 → 3111.26] We have H1Zen1.
[3111.44 → 3114.20] We have all these other various problems.
[3115.10 → 3117.18] We're going to get such a huge viewer count.
[3117.18 → 3120.80] But yeah, like all these launches that just go terribly.
[3120.82 → 3124.02] If I cover the nipples with the Powered by Linus tech tips, I should be okay.
[3125.36 → 3128.26] I'm going to claim that Twitch told me that, but they definitely didn't.
[3129.42 → 3131.12] I feel like you're going to screw up at some point.
[3131.42 → 3132.38] Oh, no, no.
[3132.42 → 3132.82] Oh, yeah.
[3132.86 → 3133.48] You made it.
[3133.60 → 3133.72] Okay.
[3134.14 → 3135.90] I'm the nipple management expert.
[3135.90 → 3143.20] We have all these terrible launches that people freak out about justifiably.
[3143.78 → 3146.72] And then we have someone go like, okay, we don't want to be in that boat.
[3146.72 → 3148.10] Let's fix this before we launch it.
[3148.20 → 3149.12] And people freak out.
[3149.28 → 3150.04] What are you doing?
[3151.04 → 3151.48] God.
[3151.82 → 3154.58] We have to be united and decide what we want.
[3154.70 → 3158.24] What we want is games that work at the beginning.
[3158.38 → 3158.64] Yes.
[3158.74 → 3162.18] When we first install them without 20 gigs of patches or whatever else.
[3162.28 → 3163.68] And then like...
[3163.68 → 3164.64] Oh, man.
[3164.78 → 3165.58] What was it?
[3165.64 → 3166.78] Unity that came out with like...
[3166.78 → 3167.78] You should probably have a 680.
[3167.96 → 3168.54] Was that Unity?
[3168.78 → 3169.30] Assassin's Creed Unity?
[3169.56 → 3170.26] I don't remember.
[3170.26 → 3171.16] Some game.
[3171.24 → 3171.56] I don't know.
[3171.68 → 3172.60] I don't care already.
[3172.76 → 3177.36] But some game came out, probably Unity, that needed way too high performance stuff.
[3177.42 → 3178.76] And everyone freaked out because they couldn't run it.
[3179.02 → 3184.76] And then GTA comes out, and they're like, oh, I expected it to look better and have higher requirements.
[3184.88 → 3186.86] I'm like, god-damn it, PC community.
[3186.86 → 3187.54] Anyway.
[3188.96 → 3189.26] Sorry.
[3191.00 → 3191.44] Alright.
[3191.74 → 3192.56] We can probably move on now.
[3192.56 → 3195.54] Yeah, I guess that's all there is to really say about that, isn't there?
[3196.84 → 3197.88] More gaming news.
[3198.00 → 3200.10] This is from PlayStationing.com.
[3200.24 → 3206.40] Sony is making $50 million a month from PlayStation Plus.
[3206.62 → 3207.34] Isn't that incredible?
[3207.48 → 3208.06] Do you want to post this?
[3208.94 → 3209.42] It's okay.
[3209.48 → 3209.86] I can do it.
[3209.86 → 3210.18] I got it.
[3210.62 → 3210.94] Are you sure?
[3211.10 → 3211.58] I got it.
[3211.66 → 3212.08] I got it.
[3212.16 → 3212.52] I got it.
[3212.56 → 3213.22] No, I got it.
[3213.30 → 3213.80] I did it first.
[3213.98 → 3214.10] Boom.
[3214.44 → 3215.08] You lost.
[3216.06 → 3216.42] Disappointed.
[3216.42 → 3218.08] So let's go ahead and fire this up.
[3218.56 → 3228.16] No freaking wonder Microsoft got all over that Xbox Live gold nonsense and turning multiplayer
[3228.16 → 3229.24] into a paid service.
[3229.34 → 3234.92] Because if you're going to try and tell me that you're spending $50 million a month to
[3234.92 → 3237.16] make the online gaming experience...
[3237.16 → 3238.62] Would you pay $5 a month for Steam?
[3240.10 → 3241.42] Does it include content?
[3242.56 → 3243.10] No.
[3243.44 → 3244.10] No, of course not.
[3244.10 → 3245.54] Well, it includes free games.
[3245.54 → 3246.50] TF2.
[3247.16 → 3247.70] Stuff like that.
[3248.18 → 3248.38] No.
[3249.08 → 3250.04] I don't want to play TF2.
[3250.72 → 3251.48] Yeah, absolutely not.
[3251.72 → 3255.04] So you wouldn't use the Steam service if it costs $5 a month?
[3255.84 → 3256.20] No.
[3256.32 → 3259.10] I think I'm already paying for the Steam service by buying my games through them.
[3259.64 → 3262.24] So they're already taking a cut.
[3262.24 → 3263.80] No, like we have to...
[3263.80 → 3264.80] We have to...
[3264.80 → 3265.54] We have to...
[3265.54 → 3268.24] Like, assume you don't have a Steam account yet.
[3268.46 → 3268.92] Like, we're...
[3268.92 → 3269.14] Okay.
[3269.14 → 3272.04] Like, this is not this realm of reality.
[3272.70 → 3277.06] So your options are buying things on the Steam service or buying them directly...
[3277.06 → 3278.12] Like buying them at a store.
[3278.38 → 3279.54] And not playing online.
[3279.54 → 3283.08] Or there's like a download link from the company.
[3283.16 → 3290.60] So if they forced me, if I wasn't allowed to play online, unless I paid $5 a month for
[3290.60 → 3290.94] Steam.
[3291.06 → 3292.18] No, that's not even...
[3292.18 → 3295.54] That's an interesting discussion, but that's not the one I'm trying to send out.
[3295.54 → 3298.96] So would I pay $5 a month just for what Steam is today?
[3299.40 → 3299.84] Essentially.
[3300.08 → 3301.00] Steam and home streaming.
[3301.38 → 3302.40] Steam and home streaming.
[3302.42 → 3302.94] Free games.
[3302.96 → 3303.48] Steam music.
[3303.68 → 3304.56] Some free games.
[3304.80 → 3306.86] The unification of chat.
[3307.44 → 3308.44] Steam overlay.
[3308.98 → 3311.70] The download service, which is a lot better than most.
[3312.58 → 3313.96] All of that kind of stuff.
[3314.04 → 3315.22] Would you pay $5 a month for that?
[3316.62 → 3318.14] I feel like straw pulling this.
[3319.20 → 3319.54] Wow.
[3319.68 → 3320.24] Straw pull it.
[3320.32 → 3320.90] Straw pull it.
[3322.14 → 3322.58] Wow.
[3322.92 → 3323.64] That's tough.
[3323.64 → 3327.06] If my other choice was to not have it.
[3327.14 → 3328.34] Because a lot of the...
[3328.34 → 3330.08] Okay, you'd still be able to play multiplayer and stuff.
[3330.54 → 3331.12] Yeah, I know.
[3331.28 → 3331.94] But you'd have to deal with all that.
[3331.96 → 3337.92] But a lot of the argument that I make for boycotting something like PlayStation Plus or
[3337.92 → 3343.12] Xbox Live Gold, where I just kind of went, look guys, if we all refused to pay for it,
[3343.12 → 3345.52] it would go away like that.
[3345.66 → 3352.78] A lot of the argument that I make for that is based on the fact that we have it for free
[3352.78 → 3356.52] on the PC so you have other options that you could take advantage of.
[3356.52 → 3364.36] If you were taking away my option of not having any platform where I don't have to pay an
[3364.36 → 3370.38] additional fee for the overlay, like even something like Steam Big Picture, you could
[3370.38 → 3376.60] look at as a value add for people who want to use Steam to even just manage their library
[3376.60 → 3377.12] of games.
[3377.12 → 3383.30] So if I had no choice, and the only other option was like Windows Explorer, C colon slash
[3383.30 → 3388.02] program files slash, you know, Code master slash grid slash...
[3388.02 → 3390.30] Like if that's it, would I pay $5 a month?
[3390.38 → 3391.64] It's not a lot of money.
[3391.76 → 3392.84] I probably would.
[3394.36 → 3396.14] I probably just...
[3396.14 → 3399.82] I would probably sign up for it once out of frustration, and then I'd forget about it
[3399.82 → 3401.56] and I'd just kind of do it forever.
[3401.78 → 3403.14] That's kind of how it was.
[3403.14 → 3406.60] And I think if Steam wasn't there, a lot of those services that you have that kind of
[3406.60 → 3407.94] bring them all together wouldn't exist.
[3408.26 → 3413.88] Now, to be completely honest, if Steam wasn't there, I bet you the Windows games folder kind
[3413.88 → 3417.78] of idea probably would have actually stuck around and that was fantastic and that really
[3417.78 → 3418.58] should still be a thing.
[3419.74 → 3421.56] But yeah, I don't know.
[3421.66 → 3423.66] It's just an interesting idea that popped into my head.
[3423.90 → 3425.14] Can you hang out to me this...
[3425.86 → 3426.86] This drop hole thing?
[3426.92 → 3427.50] Yeah, this drop hole.
[3427.56 → 3427.74] Sure.
[3427.98 → 3430.02] So I can go ahead and post the results.
[3430.02 → 3430.52] Do you just want the results?
[3430.52 → 3431.00] Oh, crap.
[3431.00 → 3431.88] Do you want the results?
[3431.98 → 3433.22] I didn't realize I was still screen sharing.
[3433.42 → 3434.52] Yeah, I want the results link.
[3435.16 → 3435.98] It doesn't really matter.
[3436.08 → 3438.10] I can navigate to the results link on my own.
[3441.90 → 3442.70] Thank you.
[3443.08 → 3448.98] So far, it's looking like about 43% of people are saying no, 31% of people are saying Austin's
[3448.98 → 3451.42] nipple, and 26% of people are saying yes.
[3452.62 → 3453.04] All right.
[3453.10 → 3453.52] Here we go.
[3453.60 → 3456.26] I'll get those results visually for you guys there.
[3456.38 → 3456.80] There we go.
[3456.80 → 3459.08] So, yeah.
[3459.38 → 3460.22] A lot of noes.
[3460.58 → 3461.48] A lot of...
[3461.48 → 3463.98] I refuse to say anything relevant about this.
[3464.44 → 3469.36] And then actually, the fact that 26% of you are saying yes is a strong indicator to me
[3469.36 → 3474.44] that if Valve did decide to charge for the service, they might actually generate a lot
[3474.44 → 3474.80] of subscriptions.
[3474.96 → 3476.68] I mean, we're probably not a long way off.
[3476.96 → 3481.40] I suspect they'll never make it mandatory, but an optional subscription that gives you extra
[3481.40 → 3485.76] features, a la, you know, gold or plus.
[3485.90 → 3486.44] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3486.44 → 3487.36] Steam plus.
[3487.36 → 3491.44] I don't think multiplayer will ever be one of those additional features for something
[3491.44 → 3491.92] like Steam.
[3492.08 → 3492.36] No.
[3492.36 → 3494.26] But if it gave you additional...
[3494.26 → 3497.28] Well, that's why I took the multiplayer element out of that whole discussion.
[3497.28 → 3502.66] But if it gave you additional community interaction features or some other benefits, I mean, people
[3502.66 → 3503.48] pay for hats.
[3505.12 → 3506.78] Like, what if all it did?
[3506.90 → 3512.10] What if all it did was drop you a care package from time to time with a hat in it that's exclusive
[3512.10 → 3513.80] to people who are Steam Plus members?
[3513.96 → 3515.94] I bet you they'd get way more.
[3516.34 → 3517.06] Oh, my God.
[3517.30 → 3518.12] And that's something that...
[3518.12 → 3518.70] Oh, my God.
[3518.74 → 3520.08] And that's something that Steam would totally do.
[3521.00 → 3521.86] Oh, man.
[3521.92 → 3524.26] If you got, like, random indie items in Valve games...
[3524.26 → 3525.96] I hope Gabe's not watching right now.
[3525.96 → 3528.84] It's like, hey, we could have this rolled out, like, tomorrow.
[3530.62 → 3531.38] Oh, my goodness.
[3531.48 → 3537.16] And the thing is, okay, not harping on the people that said no too much, but I myself
[3537.16 → 3542.84] kind of sit in the no camp right now because I could see myself using other systems to manage
[3542.84 → 3543.30] my games.
[3543.48 → 3543.72] Right.
[3543.78 → 3549.50] Although, however annoying that would be, myself and a lot of people in the no camp, that
[3549.50 → 3554.84] might change if you didn't have limited of, like, five minutes to think about this answer.
[3554.84 → 3555.84] Right.
[3555.84 → 3560.36] If you were then sitting on your computer months from now, and you couldn't remember what freaking
[3560.36 → 3564.78] game you owned or where the key was that you could download it off the website because
[3564.78 → 3568.78] they have bad account management, and you're dealing with all these other crap things and
[3568.78 → 3573.76] you could just be like, well, I could just get Steam, inject all my games there and then
[3573.76 → 3574.20] be fine.
[3575.02 → 3575.62] I don't know.
[3575.62 → 3577.36] I see more of those noes changing.
[3577.48 → 3579.46] I see myself maybe being a little bit more flexible.
[3580.74 → 3581.36] I don't know.
[3581.52 → 3582.00] It's interesting.
[3583.70 → 3584.16] All right.
[3584.22 → 3584.76] What's our next topic here?
[3584.76 → 3585.78] None of that is a thing at all.
[3586.08 → 3587.22] It's just kind of a thought experiment.
[3587.30 → 3587.40] Yeah.
[3587.42 → 3588.74] This is just us making things up.
[3588.82 → 3589.02] Yep.
[3589.72 → 3590.12] Fortunately.
[3590.34 → 3591.30] So, yes.
[3591.46 → 3592.14] Very fortunately.
[3592.40 → 3594.60] We can jump to a few things, actually.
[3594.76 → 3594.94] Oh.
[3595.30 → 3599.42] There's the Marriott abandoning their quest to block personal Wi-Fi hotspots.
[3599.50 → 3601.30] This is from inc.com.
[3601.68 → 3602.92] I'm going to go ahead and fire this up.
[3602.96 → 3603.84] You want to post it in the chat?
[3603.98 → 3604.14] Yep.
[3604.70 → 3605.90] So, this was ridiculous.
[3606.12 → 3611.98] Basically, they got slammed with, I think it was a $600,000 fine when it was discovered
[3611.98 → 3618.16] that they were intentionally blocking their users' personal Wi-Fi hotspots, like on their
[3618.16 → 3621.28] phones, from functioning in the rooms.
[3621.78 → 3623.10] And then they apologized.
[3623.82 → 3629.42] And then they turned around and tried to get permission from the FCC to implement that
[3629.42 → 3631.84] technology in places like conference rooms.
[3632.54 → 3634.10] Are you freaking for real?
[3634.20 → 3639.86] And they claimed this was to prevent people from showing up in Marriott hotels, creating
[3639.86 → 3645.52] unauthorized hotspots with the intention of stealing data and information from the patrons
[3645.52 → 3646.10] of the hotel.
[3646.10 → 3648.00] And I kind of go, okay.
[3648.00 → 3652.66] That is a scenario that probably happened like once.
[3653.32 → 3656.34] And there are other ways to get around something like that.
[3656.74 → 3665.20] And I think it was fairly obvious, like on the surface of this, that this was all about
[3665.20 → 3670.76] trying to get people to pay additional for Wi-Fi in the hotel, especially business customers
[3670.76 → 3672.04] who are coming in for conferences.
[3672.04 → 3675.64] And the FCC received 39 comment letters.
[3675.68 → 3678.04] This is from the Inc.com article.
[3679.24 → 3683.02] Received 39 comment letters on the issue, of which 38 were negative.
[3683.52 → 3685.92] And one was either neutral or off-topic.
[3686.50 → 3689.72] Google and Microsoft were among those registering their opposition.
[3690.38 → 3693.36] So at least they're on the same side about something right now.
[3693.80 → 3694.24] Yeah, really.
[3695.06 → 3695.86] And I'm glad it's that.
[3695.86 → 3699.26] Not really getting along everywhere, but they're such big companies that I guess parts of them
[3699.26 → 3700.50] can get along with other parts.
[3701.90 → 3702.42] Sigh.
[3702.82 → 3703.42] All right.
[3706.70 → 3708.16] We've got the Tesla thing.
[3708.74 → 3710.76] Let's do the Obama thing.
[3710.90 → 3711.16] Sure.
[3711.52 → 3711.72] Yeah.
[3711.82 → 3714.58] So this was originally posted in the forum by Lightning.
[3715.02 → 3715.38] I got it.
[3715.46 → 3716.38] And you got it?
[3716.38 → 3716.58] Okay.
[3716.58 → 3723.64] Obama calls for an end to 19 state laws that harm community broadband.
[3723.64 → 3732.96] This is awesome because Obama calling for the internet to be reclassified as a utility
[3732.96 → 3739.30] marked a bit of a turning point, maybe not in the FCC chairman Tom Wheeler's thoughts
[3739.30 → 3743.02] about whether it would be Title II.
[3743.54 → 3749.08] Maybe he was already leaning that way, but it definitely brought about a change in his actions
[3749.08 → 3751.48] and what he was saying publicly about it.
[3751.48 → 3756.90] And it looks like Obama's going to kind of go keep moving forward with this whole, yeah,
[3757.04 → 3761.18] if we want to be a developed nation, let's face it.
[3761.26 → 3763.16] We've already got, you know, sewage.
[3763.34 → 3767.60] We've already got electricity, mostly, other than that it can be extremely expensive.
[3767.68 → 3769.48] We've already got water, again, mostly.
[3769.80 → 3775.06] Actually, fascinating conversation with Baron about how things work with the Colorado
[3775.06 → 3777.06] River and allocating the water.
[3777.06 → 3783.08] Yeah, he was saying that the way, like any downstream states get an allocation in gallons.
[3783.46 → 3788.46] So if the flow is less, Colorado is actually the first one to not get any water from the
[3788.46 → 3789.00] Colorado River.
[3789.38 → 3790.64] Anyway, I thought that was interesting.
[3790.92 → 3797.98] So anyway, they've got most stuff mostly figured out, and yet they're lagging behind on broadband
[3797.98 → 3806.06] because of either cost or legislative challenges that exist that prevent any startup from becoming
[3806.06 → 3810.02] becoming an internet service provider and kind of going, you know what?
[3810.12 → 3814.10] Hey, those margins, that profitability, that's not good enough for AT&T.
[3814.20 → 3814.96] Yeah, I'll take it.
[3815.42 → 3815.96] I'll take it.
[3816.00 → 3817.54] I mean, it stifles competition.
[3817.54 → 3823.78] That's the principle that this entire country, and I mean, by this, I mean the USA.
[3823.78 → 3824.68] I don't live there.
[3824.68 → 3830.46] But that entire country was built on was competition and capitalism.
[3830.66 → 3835.32] And if you just legislate the crap out of anyone being able to compete, then you end up in a
[3835.32 → 3838.64] situation where it's this monopolistic nonsense.
[3838.90 → 3840.36] And it's not quite a monopoly.
[3840.70 → 3844.28] So this was a fascinating chunk of the article.
[3844.74 → 3845.42] Yes, here we go.
[3845.42 → 3851.24] So with the old broadband classification of, I believe it was three down, one up?
[3851.42 → 3851.84] Four down.
[3851.96 → 3852.76] Four down, one up.
[3853.38 → 3857.66] 75% of consumers have a choice between two or more fixed providers.
[3858.18 → 3863.50] And 15% can select among three or more, which I would even still say is abominable.
[3863.62 → 3864.48] Yeah, it's terrible.
[3864.76 → 3868.68] However, in the market for internet service that can deliver 25 megabit downstream,
[3868.68 → 3875.22] I mean, we're talking the speed at which you could pretty much do anything on the internet.
[3875.50 → 3875.94] You know, Netflix.
[3876.48 → 3876.86] Acceptable.
[3877.06 → 3879.58] You know, HD YouTube, stuff like that.
[3880.32 → 3881.32] Modern day acceptable.
[3881.76 → 3885.94] Three out of four Americans had no choice between providers.
[3887.72 → 3889.30] I mean, when was this ever acceptable?
[3889.48 → 3895.46] I mean, I hate to be critical when they're finally speaking up and doing the right things.
[3895.50 → 3897.16] But why did this take so long?
[3897.16 → 3901.94] And when's Canada going to follow suit like we always do?
[3904.02 → 3905.80] It'll take us a couple of years and then we'll get there.
[3906.02 → 3909.18] And, you know, I've seen a lot of people wearing their cynicism hats,
[3909.62 → 3913.34] and especially on our forum where a lot of our community is international
[3913.34 → 3917.46] and sort of going, well, this is only because the election's coming.
[3917.58 → 3923.40] I mean, okay, maybe there's some pressure from the Democratic Party
[3923.40 → 3926.54] to, you know, improve Obama's popularity.
[3926.54 → 3931.54] So whoever their new candidate coming in will have a better chance of winning the upcoming election.
[3931.90 → 3935.46] But, guys, Obama cannot be re-elected.
[3936.18 → 3937.26] This is his second term.
[3937.40 → 3940.02] You can only serve two four-year terms in the United States.
[3940.02 → 3944.86] So it's not like Obama personally wants to be the president for another four years
[3944.86 → 3950.68] and is therefore trying to win a popularity contest by, you know, making...
[3950.68 → 3953.94] Especially a lot of this focuses on community broadband initiatives.
[3954.52 → 3958.80] So smaller community ISPs or even municipalities themselves,
[3959.80 → 3962.50] enabling them to utilize their existing infrastructure.
[3962.74 → 3965.10] So whether it's power or sewage or whatever else to run lines
[3965.10 → 3967.62] and create their own broadband providers.
[3968.54 → 3970.26] Don't remember where I was going with that.
[3970.40 → 3971.96] The sentence kind of ends here.
[3972.06 → 3975.18] It's not hugely beneficial for himself necessarily.
[3975.50 → 3975.66] Yeah.
[3975.84 → 3977.80] Because you were talking about elections coming up.
[3977.80 → 3978.76] And it's not just pop...
[3978.76 → 3979.96] It's not a popularity contest.
[3980.10 → 3985.80] I mean, it's a fact that access to high-speed internet breeds creativity
[3985.80 → 3988.78] and gives people more options to better themselves.
[3988.96 → 3991.76] I mean, let's go back to one of our sponsors for a minute here.
[3992.48 → 3992.62] Yeah.
[3992.62 → 3993.40] Linda.com.
[3993.64 → 3993.86] What?
[3993.94 → 3997.72] Are you going to use Linda.com video tutorials on dial-up?
[3997.80 → 3998.06] No?
[3998.80 → 3999.58] That's ridiculous.
[3999.58 → 4001.58] I mean, what if you have...
[4002.10 → 4002.42] Okay.
[4002.62 → 4005.42] What if your Linda.com membership is really reasonably priced,
[4005.70 → 4009.58] but your internet connection has such a small cap
[4009.58 → 4011.92] that by the time you watch the instructional videos,
[4012.06 → 4015.74] you're actually paying a ton more just to educate yourself
[4015.74 → 4019.54] and potentially improve your prospects in terms of your career path.
[4019.60 → 4020.98] I mean, it's absurd.
[4021.46 → 4024.46] Inexpensive broadband has become something we need,
[4024.64 → 4027.54] not something that should be a privilege for the wealthy.
[4027.54 → 4029.26] So, just...
[4029.26 → 4029.56] There.
[4029.68 → 4030.06] That's it.
[4030.24 → 4030.46] Kudos.
[4030.94 → 4031.08] Yeah.
[4031.48 → 4032.84] Very happy about that whole situation.
[4032.88 → 4034.98] The FCC is already examining these state laws
[4034.98 → 4036.82] and considering whether it can invalidate them
[4036.82 → 4039.86] by using its authority to promote competition
[4039.86 → 4041.12] in telecommunications already.
[4041.58 → 4043.14] So, good.
[4043.42 → 4044.54] All the progress.
[4044.88 → 4045.76] Let's make it happen.
[4046.48 → 4049.18] Jumping to a not necessarily happier note,
[4049.28 → 4050.10] but a funnier note,
[4050.18 → 4051.22] we can do the beautiful thing.
[4051.50 → 4051.72] Yeah.
[4051.84 → 4052.54] Oh, my goodness.
[4052.62 → 4053.22] This is ridiculous.
[4053.24 → 4054.34] We just want to have some entertainment.
[4054.34 → 4058.34] I mean, speaking of things that should be illegal...
[4060.34 → 4061.34] Let's...
[4061.90 → 4062.62] Oh, dang it.
[4064.56 → 4065.46] All right, here we go.
[4065.54 → 4066.60] Okay, I'll post it.
[4066.72 → 4068.72] Our original source for this was CNET.
[4068.94 → 4069.24] I got it.
[4069.92 → 4071.48] But their article is down,
[4071.64 → 4073.52] so the Telegraph article is still live.
[4073.62 → 4074.34] This is a restaurant...
[4074.90 → 4077.12] There's actually a different CNET article now,
[4077.32 → 4078.20] but don't worry about it.
[4078.30 → 4079.24] I was trying to figure...
[4079.24 → 4080.22] I should have fixed the link.
[4080.32 → 4081.16] I was trying to figure it out earlier.
[4081.16 → 4087.04] Okay, so there's a restaurant that promises free meal for good-looking.
[4087.96 → 4090.48] Now, they've been forced to take down that sign.
[4090.76 → 4090.88] Yeah.
[4090.88 → 4092.74] The local government forced them to take down the sign.
[4092.74 → 4094.64] Yeah, like, showed up with a wrecking crew.
[4094.90 → 4097.00] It's like, we are taking down that sign.
[4097.68 → 4098.96] Because that's embarrassing.
[4099.26 → 4102.44] But they have vowed to continue the promotion regardless.
[4102.44 → 4106.90] How this works is there's a scanner,
[4107.30 → 4108.66] and there's a panel of surgeons,
[4108.94 → 4111.02] which are plastic surgeons,
[4111.24 → 4113.66] which are in cahoots with the restaurant for a sponsorship.
[4113.84 → 4115.02] Paying a sponsorship.
[4115.22 → 4115.60] Oh, sorry.
[4115.68 → 4116.52] I'm in my dashboard now.
[4116.64 → 4117.46] I always forget about that.
[4117.48 → 4118.70] For essentially advertisements,
[4118.88 → 4119.66] so you can go there,
[4119.76 → 4120.98] get told you're not good-looking,
[4121.12 → 4123.06] and then be referred to those people
[4123.06 → 4124.60] to become better looking.
[4125.44 → 4126.48] Oh, ridiculous.
[4126.48 → 4129.14] And so, apparently, it's not flat out,
[4129.28 → 4130.66] like, you're good-looking,
[4131.06 → 4132.44] you get a free meal.
[4132.62 → 4133.42] You're not good-looking,
[4133.62 → 4134.98] you get a full price meal.
[4135.44 → 4137.24] It's like, there's a sliding scale.
[4137.46 → 4137.66] Really?
[4137.66 → 4139.28] So you could be pretty good-looking,
[4139.40 → 4141.74] and you could get, like, 30% off or something.
[4141.82 → 4143.62] Like, I'm making up the exact numbers.
[4143.98 → 4145.54] But, really?
[4146.28 → 4147.08] Like, that's just,
[4147.20 → 4148.66] that's just gross.
[4149.58 → 4150.60] And I'm not just saying this
[4150.60 → 4152.32] because I don't think I'd be getting a discount.
[4152.52 → 4154.22] I just think that is absolutely disgusting.
[4154.22 → 4157.26] What I noticed is that OP, Mr. Amp12345,
[4157.90 → 4159.78] states in his second paragraph,
[4160.20 → 4163.12] as someone who has had things given to me
[4163.12 → 4164.12] or gotten discounts
[4164.12 → 4166.28] because of the clerk thought I was good-looking,
[4166.62 → 4168.22] I was unsure how I felt about this.
[4168.84 → 4171.42] So, my new idea is that we,
[4171.64 → 4172.88] as of Lion's Detective's community,
[4173.12 → 4175.44] need to find Amp12345,
[4176.08 → 4177.70] take him, bring him to the restaurant,
[4177.70 → 4179.18] and then just all eat there
[4179.18 → 4179.94] until they're bankrupt.
[4179.94 → 4184.62] So, we're going to force-feed Amp.
[4184.78 → 4185.30] No, no, no, no.
[4185.42 → 4186.30] He can get all the food,
[4186.36 → 4186.96] and we can just eat it.
[4187.76 → 4189.50] Oh, I see.
[4189.88 → 4191.96] I think they probably would catch on to that.
[4192.28 → 4193.68] It's a very smart idea, though.
[4193.72 → 4194.48] You did very well.
[4194.52 → 4194.80] Thank you.
[4194.90 → 4195.58] You did very well.
[4195.62 → 4196.42] I'm very proud of you.
[4197.24 → 4198.98] I just want to utilize Amp's,
[4199.04 → 4200.36] obviously, tried and true,
[4200.78 → 4201.74] amazingly good looks.
[4201.84 → 4202.98] This was posted by,
[4202.98 → 4204.72] this was posted by Tester,
[4205.12 → 4206.60] and since we're on the topic
[4206.60 → 4208.74] of just completely stupid things right now,
[4209.78 → 4214.98] this Kickstarter by Paul Boyle is...
[4215.50 → 4216.28] 30 euros.
[4216.36 → 4217.38] He probably did it himself.
[4218.22 → 4219.84] Well, he has seven backers.
[4220.60 → 4222.60] Seven backers totalling 30 euros.
[4222.70 → 4223.80] That doesn't even divide evenly.
[4224.00 → 4225.94] So, he made seven Kickstarter accounts
[4225.94 → 4228.48] and then got bored and ate a burger.
[4229.42 → 4230.74] So, I mean, you can see
[4230.74 → 4233.72] that this is clearly not intended to be serious,
[4234.00 → 4235.44] but the plan is to reconstruct
[4235.44 → 4236.70] the player Michael's house
[4236.70 → 4238.90] from the game Grand Theft Auto V to scale,
[4239.12 → 4240.86] and the rewards are ridiculous.
[4241.44 → 4243.22] I mean, for...
[4243.22 → 4244.26] Okay, so for four...
[4244.26 → 4245.80] For $5,000, you can stay there for three nights?
[4245.90 → 4249.40] For four euros, you get pictures and a video of it.
[4249.98 → 4252.36] For 400 euros, you get a personalized title
[4252.36 → 4254.30] with image and info of your choice
[4254.30 → 4256.20] added to the bottom of Michael's swimming pool.
[4256.20 → 4258.98] For 900 euros, you get to visit the house
[4258.98 → 4260.84] and have a tour around it at your leisure.
[4261.26 → 4263.28] And for 5,000 euros, you get to visit
[4263.28 → 4264.68] and stay in it for three nights.
[4265.68 → 4267.20] I just thought it was kind of funny.
[4267.82 → 4269.52] He figures he needs...
[4269.52 → 4271.46] Oh, the FAQ.
[4271.58 → 4272.18] This is pretty good.
[4272.52 → 4273.82] Who will the house belong to?
[4274.16 → 4276.28] Will the donators get a share in the final build?
[4276.40 → 4277.42] Are you giving it to charity?
[4277.84 → 4278.84] No shares, I'm afraid.
[4279.02 → 4280.70] Given the small chance that it's funded,
[4280.82 → 4282.50] the final build will be sold and donated
[4282.50 → 4285.18] to the choice of charity voted by the backers.
[4285.76 → 4288.10] Which, I mean, the last time anyone believed
[4288.10 → 4289.66] that a Kickstarter for charity
[4289.66 → 4291.50] was actually going to a charity was,
[4291.58 → 4293.62] I don't know, 2013?
[4294.50 → 4295.68] Yeah, not that long ago.
[4295.78 → 4295.98] Yeah.
[4296.32 → 4297.66] This Kickstarter hasn't been around that long.
[4297.78 → 4297.96] No.
[4298.76 → 4299.52] But, yeah.
[4299.60 → 4301.14] In internet years, it's been quite a while.
[4301.40 → 4301.60] Yep.
[4302.92 → 4304.70] I don't know.
[4304.74 → 4305.90] Is there anything else interesting?
[4305.96 → 4309.80] There's the not super amazingly interesting Tesla news,
[4309.94 → 4310.98] but I can talk about it regardless.
[4311.12 → 4311.48] Sure, yeah.
[4311.48 → 4312.32] Let's talk about the 3.
[4312.96 → 4315.24] So there's honestly not a ton to say.
[4315.36 → 4316.50] This article exploded.
[4316.68 → 4318.38] Posted by Victoria's Secret, by the way.
[4318.56 → 4318.76] Yep.
[4318.86 → 4319.78] This article exploded.
[4319.90 → 4321.46] I can get this into the chat.
[4323.36 → 4325.68] And it's kind of an interesting conversation,
[4325.98 → 4326.72] but people were like,
[4326.80 → 4328.64] oh my God, the Tesla 3 is so amazing.
[4328.84 → 4330.44] There's not actually that much information here
[4330.44 → 4331.34] about the Tesla 3.
[4331.68 → 4333.46] This is the Model X delayed again.
[4333.46 → 4334.18] That's the Model X, yeah.
[4335.58 → 4337.90] And once again, we shouldn't be complaining about the delay,
[4338.10 → 4338.92] even though it kind of sucks,
[4339.02 → 4340.98] because they're saying that they're just trying to do it right.
[4340.98 → 4344.58] They sold out like the first manufacturing year of this thing anyway,
[4344.74 → 4345.34] so whatever.
[4346.96 → 4351.06] Anyway, the feds give about $7,500 for electric cars, apparently.
[4351.32 → 4351.98] This is in the States.
[4352.08 → 4352.62] I don't really know.
[4352.92 → 4356.44] So when Chevy came out and was talking about their Bolt,
[4356.64 → 4358.04] which is supposed to be a Tesla competitor,
[4358.40 → 4363.16] they were toting it as a $30,000 price tag vehicle.
[4363.16 → 4365.88] This is a response.
[4366.14 → 4367.76] Elon Musk in an interview was like,
[4368.22 → 4370.66] well, ours is, what is it?
[4370.66 → 4371.02] $35,000.
[4371.02 → 4371.92] $35,000.
[4372.16 → 4375.40] So using their logic, it's actually $27,500.
[4375.96 → 4376.20] Right.
[4376.32 → 4378.78] That was the whole actual point of this article.
[4378.86 → 4380.00] Now this thing exploded.
[4380.20 → 4381.74] This got everywhere.
[4382.20 → 4383.80] Like automotive Subreddit,
[4383.88 → 4385.44] it was like massive at front page,
[4385.50 → 4385.98] all this kind of stuff.
[4386.66 → 4390.38] All he's talking about is that he didn't include incentives
[4390.38 → 4391.78] in the price of $35,000.
[4392.20 → 4393.50] That's all it really was.
[4395.10 → 4396.44] As we already knew,
[4397.28 → 4398.88] you're going to be able to customize it,
[4398.96 → 4399.54] add options.
[4399.64 → 4401.26] A lot of things that are actually on the Model S.
[4401.34 → 4402.54] If you like something very specifically,
[4402.62 → 4403.28] it's on the Model S.
[4403.34 → 4405.60] You might be able to include it on your 3,
[4405.78 → 4407.88] but that will obviously increase the cost,
[4407.94 → 4409.46] so it could be more expensive in the end.
[4409.46 → 4411.92] So your version of the Model 3
[4411.92 → 4414.78] might end up being the same cost as a Bolt.
[4415.84 → 4416.52] Who knows?
[4416.64 → 4417.58] Because you can configure them.
[4418.54 → 4418.94] Yeah.
[4419.08 → 4420.84] One cool quote that came from it, though,
[4420.88 → 4421.62] which is interesting,
[4422.00 → 4423.42] is that Musk said,
[4423.54 → 4425.08] the Model 3, in brackets,
[4425.50 → 4427.62] will be way different from any other car on the road,
[4427.96 → 4429.58] but in a way that's really useful
[4429.58 → 4431.38] and doesn't just make it a weird mobile.
[4432.40 → 4433.12] Weird mobile.
[4433.44 → 4435.22] So I don't know what that means.
[4436.00 → 4436.76] But yeah, this,
[4437.16 → 4438.60] I love Tesla news.
[4438.60 → 4440.16] Because this exploded,
[4440.50 → 4441.38] but it wasn't actually,
[4442.68 → 4444.06] yeah, I don't know.
[4444.06 → 4444.36] All right.
[4444.44 → 4445.94] So this is interesting to me,
[4446.00 → 4446.62] because I'm Canadian.
[4446.88 → 4449.60] Sony is shutting all of their Canadian stores.
[4450.74 → 4452.22] I've got the article here.
[4452.24 → 4453.54] When was the last time you went to a Sony store?
[4455.48 → 4455.92] Wow.
[4456.18 → 4456.96] I posted it already.
[4458.98 → 4460.40] I totally get it,
[4460.46 → 4462.18] because I don't think Sony stores
[4462.18 → 4464.58] really have any reason to exist,
[4465.00 → 4466.64] especially when a lot of the time
[4466.64 → 4468.40] they were just a place where
[4468.40 → 4472.42] you couldn't shop for any other brand of product,
[4472.92 → 4474.94] and the pricing wasn't better,
[4475.16 → 4475.82] often worse,
[4475.90 → 4477.26] because it wouldn't have the same promotions,
[4477.46 → 4478.94] because it's really awkward.
[4479.14 → 4480.04] For most manufacturers,
[4480.18 → 4481.54] Apple doesn't seem to give a rat's ass,
[4481.64 → 4483.06] but most manufacturers,
[4483.22 → 4484.54] to have their own branded store
[4484.54 → 4485.82] that competes head-to-head
[4485.82 → 4486.66] against their customers.
[4486.66 → 4488.88] So they have to prove to their customers,
[4489.04 → 4490.56] whether it's a Best Buy or whoever else,
[4490.68 → 4492.46] that they're not trying to undercut them
[4492.46 → 4493.70] and steal customers from them,
[4493.80 → 4494.66] and at the same time,
[4494.76 → 4497.04] they have to sustain their employees
[4497.04 → 4499.16] and the retail spaces.
[4499.40 → 4500.82] The one Sony store I've ever been to,
[4500.92 → 4502.32] the one time I went to it,
[4502.54 → 4503.90] was just terrible anyway.
[4504.22 → 4505.94] They had a terrible selection of Sony products.
[4505.94 → 4508.22] Yeah, so anyway,
[4508.46 → 4510.12] so Sony store closing stores,
[4510.22 → 4511.30] oh, apparently Me and Jacob
[4511.30 → 4512.72] are closing a whack of stores,
[4512.80 → 4513.32] but for me,
[4513.40 → 4514.28] the big one right now
[4514.28 → 4515.26] is actually Target.
[4515.48 → 4515.82] Yes.
[4516.06 → 4517.42] So Target opened up
[4517.42 → 4518.56] the Canadian territory
[4518.56 → 4520.40] in 2012,
[4520.76 → 4521.40] I want to say.
[4522.08 → 4524.18] I thought it was 13.
[4524.64 → 4525.38] I could be wrong.
[4525.46 → 4526.28] Was it 13?
[4526.46 → 4528.00] Has it really been that short?
[4528.00 → 4529.00] I think it's been two years.
[4529.08 → 4529.76] I could be wrong though.
[4529.88 → 4530.54] Let me...
[4530.54 → 4532.30] Well, it's only barely 2015 right now.
[4532.54 → 4533.62] Anyway, the point is,
[4533.86 → 4535.60] Target actually purchased,
[4535.72 → 4536.94] at least here in the
[4537.14 → 4538.30] at least here in BC,
[4538.78 → 4540.46] all the Seller's locations
[4540.46 → 4542.00] when Seller's went bankrupt
[4542.00 → 4543.22] and disappeared.
[4543.86 → 4547.28] So they had a total of 133 big box stores
[4547.28 → 4549.20] and they will be exiting,
[4549.60 → 4551.18] okay, apparently they launched in Canada
[4551.18 → 4552.40] in March 2013.
[4552.96 → 4554.84] So they didn't even last two years
[4554.84 → 4557.08] and they will be shutting all the stores,
[4557.08 → 4559.84] putting 17,000 employees out of work
[4559.84 → 4564.18] and taking a 5.4 billion dollar loss
[4564.18 → 4565.46] in that period of time.
[4568.14 → 4569.38] There are a lot of problems.
[4570.72 → 4572.56] One of the huge ones was distribution.
[4573.02 → 4576.40] They came in and got 133 stores going
[4576.40 → 4579.02] but didn't have a proper distribution chain for them.
[4579.28 → 4580.74] So you'd have a lot of issues
[4580.74 → 4581.56] where you'd go to Target
[4581.56 → 4582.90] and there's just nothing on the shelves.
[4583.08 → 4583.22] Yep.
[4583.48 → 4584.52] So how are you supposed to buy it?
[4584.56 → 4585.56] How are they supposed to make any money?
[4585.56 → 4587.24] So they just were hemorrhaging money,
[4587.32 → 4588.44] didn't have distribution going,
[4588.58 → 4590.86] went in way too fast and way too hard,
[4591.26 → 4592.34] totally screwed up,
[4592.46 → 4594.88] and then their solution was to just close everything
[4594.88 → 4595.52] and bail.
[4596.18 → 4597.70] So in under two years,
[4597.94 → 4599.58] they got 133 stores going,
[4599.92 → 4601.90] filled them with 17,600 employees,
[4602.34 → 4603.66] fired all those employees,
[4603.86 → 4604.96] closed all of those stores,
[4605.06 → 4605.62] and took off.
[4605.62 → 4609.02] So Target said exiting Canada
[4609.02 → 4610.72] would allow it to focus resources
[4610.72 → 4611.76] on the U.S. market.
[4613.16 → 4616.00] I really, I mean, it just, it,
[4617.18 → 4617.64] I don't know.
[4617.64 → 4618.14] So misguided.
[4618.14 → 4618.80] I don't know,
[4618.94 → 4621.28] and I read one article
[4621.28 → 4622.42] that suggested that,
[4622.48 → 4622.78] you know,
[4622.86 → 4623.92] the lack of,
[4623.92 → 4625.32] of,
[4625.32 → 4626.36] of staples
[4626.36 → 4626.84] that,
[4626.88 → 4628.00] that Canadian consumers
[4628.00 → 4629.42] are used to going down
[4629.42 → 4630.46] to Target U.S.
[4630.46 → 4630.96] and buying
[4630.96 → 4631.80] and bringing back up here,
[4631.88 → 4633.32] things that just don't exist in Canada.
[4633.70 → 4634.34] I can't remember
[4634.34 → 4635.92] what the example of it was,
[4636.04 → 4636.32] but,
[4636.42 → 4637.64] I'm not actually,
[4637.70 → 4638.04] it wasn't,
[4638.04 → 4638.86] it wasn't this article,
[4638.98 → 4640.50] it was one that suggested that,
[4640.54 → 4640.82] you know,
[4640.90 → 4641.84] the lack of,
[4642.20 → 4643.20] the lack of some,
[4643.44 → 4644.32] some chocolate,
[4644.50 → 4645.06] something or other,
[4645.12 → 4645.92] might have been the reason
[4645.92 → 4646.72] for Target's failure
[4646.72 → 4647.92] because maybe people walked in
[4647.92 → 4648.82] thinking they were going to buy
[4648.82 → 4649.82] cool stuff that they're used
[4649.82 → 4650.48] to buying at Target
[4650.48 → 4651.26] and they weren't able to,
[4651.74 → 4652.06] but,
[4652.16 → 4652.46] honestly,
[4652.54 → 4653.40] I don't think that has anything
[4653.40 → 4653.88] to do with it.
[4653.90 → 4655.10] I think it was just too much,
[4655.38 → 4656.16] too fast.
[4656.48 → 4656.68] I mean,
[4656.72 → 4657.48] we were talking to,
[4657.48 → 4658.94] to Burke about this
[4658.94 → 4659.70] before the show started
[4659.70 → 4660.10] and he's like,
[4660.36 → 4660.58] yeah,
[4660.86 → 4661.64] they opened one in,
[4661.74 → 4662.24] what did he say,
[4662.30 → 4662.50] Vernon?
[4662.74 → 4662.96] Vernon.
[4663.14 → 4663.98] They opened one in Vernon.
[4664.28 → 4664.60] It's like,
[4665.10 → 4666.14] there's not even that many people
[4666.14 → 4666.52] in Vernon.
[4666.80 → 4667.00] I mean,
[4667.02 → 4667.88] did they even check?
[4667.96 → 4668.80] And they already have a Walmart.
[4669.08 → 4669.36] They like,
[4669.44 → 4670.32] barely need a Walmart
[4670.32 → 4671.14] and they already have one.
[4672.14 → 4672.62] And I think,
[4672.62 → 4673.90] I think Vernon has a Costco,
[4674.08 → 4674.28] too.
[4674.74 → 4675.26] So it's like,
[4675.60 → 4676.44] you're going to go up
[4676.44 → 4678.12] against Costco and Walmart,
[4678.34 → 4678.98] which have been there
[4678.98 → 4679.94] for years already,
[4680.20 → 4681.06] and you're going to just
[4681.06 → 4682.38] hope that,
[4682.50 → 4682.62] what,
[4682.68 → 4683.90] people magically sprout
[4683.90 → 4684.50] from the earth
[4684.50 → 4685.54] and come shop in your store?
[4685.70 → 4685.84] Like,
[4686.36 → 4688.02] try to build a sustainable
[4688.02 → 4689.04] business model first.
[4689.12 → 4689.60] And obviously,
[4689.76 → 4690.66] I'm not an expert.
[4690.80 → 4692.06] I've never run a big box store,
[4692.16 → 4693.58] but it just seems like
[4693.58 → 4694.80] there are a lot of mistakes
[4694.80 → 4695.50] in the past
[4695.50 → 4696.30] that we could have learned from.
[4696.58 → 4697.42] And this is actually,
[4697.58 → 4698.88] just the Target shutting down
[4698.88 → 4699.78] reminded me of this.
[4700.50 → 4701.64] My housing development
[4701.64 → 4702.30] that I live in
[4702.30 → 4703.88] was built about 30 years ago.
[4704.44 → 4706.54] And we still have,
[4706.60 → 4707.64] from the previous owners,
[4708.06 → 4708.82] the brochure
[4708.82 → 4710.28] that was like
[4710.28 → 4711.32] the sales brochure
[4711.32 → 4712.82] for people shopping
[4712.82 → 4713.30] for houses
[4713.30 → 4713.94] in that neighbourhood.
[4714.82 → 4715.46] And it's really cool.
[4715.54 → 4715.82] It's like,
[4716.24 → 4717.94] an accessible place to live.
[4718.26 → 4718.96] Easily accessible
[4718.96 → 4720.36] from virtually any direction.
[4720.48 → 4721.34] The property is bounded
[4721.34 → 4722.40] by a bunch of places.
[4722.78 → 4724.30] The first project of its kind
[4724.30 → 4725.48] in this area,
[4725.74 → 4726.10] blah, blah, blah,
[4726.10 → 4727.18] provides quick access
[4727.18 → 4728.76] to the interior
[4728.76 → 4729.62] of British Columbia
[4729.62 → 4730.58] and to the rest
[4730.58 → 4731.42] of the Lower Mainland.
[4731.64 → 4732.58] On the other hand,
[4732.74 → 4734.46] it's only two or three minutes away
[4734.46 → 4735.70] from, um,
[4736.12 → 4736.40] okay,
[4736.50 → 4737.70] so there's a shopping centre
[4737.70 → 4738.96] home to
[4738.96 → 4739.92] Woodward's,
[4740.78 → 4741.44] Eaton's,
[4742.30 → 4742.86] Wooloo,
[4743.62 → 4744.64] Marks and Spencer,
[4745.06 → 4747.16] and over 200 other fine stores.
[4747.38 → 4748.50] Have you heard of them?
[4749.22 → 4749.62] No.
[4751.04 → 4751.52] No.
[4751.76 → 4752.76] A few minutes further,
[4752.92 → 4753.42] you'll find
[4753.42 → 4754.48] Simpson Sears.
[4754.48 → 4755.66] So, okay,
[4756.00 → 4756.46] Sears.
[4756.94 → 4757.38] Oh, okay.
[4757.48 → 4758.10] Simpson Sears
[4758.10 → 4759.14] and the Bay.
[4759.70 → 4760.44] Okay, the Bay.
[4760.60 → 4761.92] And that Bay
[4761.92 → 4762.96] and those Sears.
[4763.08 → 4763.62] Neither of them
[4763.62 → 4764.26] exists anymore.
[4766.76 → 4767.66] Oh my goodness.
[4767.72 → 4768.52] That is so
[4768.52 → 4769.32] hilarious.
[4769.58 → 4770.74] Canada has proven
[4770.74 → 4771.64] to be an interesting market
[4771.64 → 4772.86] because of how we're laid out.
[4773.24 → 4774.20] And one of the huge,
[4774.28 → 4774.70] important,
[4775.08 → 4776.30] super crazy,
[4776.44 → 4777.22] obvious things
[4777.22 → 4777.92] about opening
[4777.92 → 4778.82] a very large amount
[4778.82 → 4779.16] of stores,
[4779.32 → 4780.06] especially in somewhere
[4780.06 → 4781.06] super huge like Canada,
[4781.62 → 4783.02] is freaking distribution.
[4783.26 → 4783.78] What are you thinking?
[4783.78 → 4785.34] Like, yes,
[4785.74 → 4786.42] we're maybe not
[4786.42 → 4788.16] the most educated people
[4788.16 → 4788.62] on opening
[4788.62 → 4789.26] a massive amount
[4789.26 → 4789.64] of stores,
[4790.02 → 4790.38] but like,
[4790.58 → 4791.56] do any amount
[4791.56 → 4792.30] of research at all.
[4792.54 → 4793.46] Look at how Best Buy
[4793.46 → 4794.28] came into Canada,
[4794.42 → 4794.98] which was actually
[4794.98 → 4796.08] a very effective takeover.
[4796.38 → 4797.72] They bought Future Shop,
[4797.86 → 4798.56] which was kind of
[4798.56 → 4799.62] our version of Best Buy,
[4800.02 → 4801.64] and then just took over
[4801.64 → 4802.36] all their warehouses.
[4802.56 → 4803.38] They bought Future Shop
[4803.38 → 4804.80] for their warehouses.
[4805.74 → 4806.94] That was the reason.
[4807.28 → 4807.88] Because they're like,
[4807.96 → 4808.64] oh, distribution
[4808.64 → 4809.38] will be a problem.
[4809.62 → 4810.74] Let's solve that problem.
[4810.74 → 4814.40] God, that's so dumb.
[4814.72 → 4815.60] Like, there could have
[4815.60 → 4816.42] been so many problems,
[4816.50 → 4817.28] but their whole thing,
[4817.38 → 4818.02] like, well,
[4818.46 → 4819.72] it was hard to make money
[4819.72 → 4820.52] when we couldn't keep
[4820.52 → 4821.34] things on the shelves
[4821.34 → 4823.50] because not necessarily
[4823.50 → 4824.38] that too many people
[4824.38 → 4824.90] were buying them,
[4824.98 → 4826.18] but we couldn't put things
[4826.18 → 4826.56] on the shelves
[4826.56 → 4827.42] because we didn't have them.
[4827.68 → 4829.34] That's so bad.
[4829.68 → 4830.34] We're getting a bunch
[4830.34 → 4831.42] of people talking about
[4831.42 → 4832.68] how apparently a couple
[4832.68 → 4833.74] of those are big
[4833.74 → 4835.14] over in Europe.
[4835.78 → 4837.16] But that's exactly it.
[4837.32 → 4838.14] Like, it's been tried
[4838.14 → 4839.80] and failed so many times
[4839.80 → 4840.78] that you would think
[4840.78 → 4842.56] they would have done
[4842.56 → 4843.26] at least a couple
[4843.26 → 4844.22] sort of case studies
[4844.22 → 4845.32] and tried to make sure
[4845.32 → 4845.76] that they were going
[4845.76 → 4846.38] to have a chance
[4846.38 → 4847.34] of success in Canada.
[4847.52 → 4847.64] Yeah.
[4847.90 → 4849.16] Or even open,
[4849.32 → 4850.08] like, five stores.
[4850.72 → 4850.96] Yeah.
[4851.10 → 4852.40] And just slowly figure it out.
[4852.46 → 4853.30] So you could lose,
[4853.70 → 4854.30] let's see,
[4854.36 → 4855.64] let's do the rough
[4855.64 → 4856.48] napkin math.
[4856.54 → 4857.12] So that's about
[4857.12 → 4859.64] 1 50th as many stores
[4859.64 → 4860.36] as they opened.
[4860.36 → 4860.94] So it would be
[4860.94 → 4862.76] 1 50th as much loss.
[4863.20 → 4863.70] So, like,
[4863.80 → 4865.18] okay, so a loss
[4865.18 → 4865.96] in the order of, what,
[4866.04 → 4867.02] tens or hundreds of millions
[4867.02 → 4868.08] as opposed to billions.
[4868.44 → 4869.44] Which is still a lot.
[4869.44 → 4870.28] Which is still a lot,
[4870.38 → 4871.14] but less.
[4871.34 → 4872.14] And for a company
[4872.14 → 4872.68] of that size,
[4872.82 → 4874.36] more growing pain size
[4874.36 → 4875.28] instead of, oh my god,
[4875.36 → 4876.28] complete failure size.
[4879.34 → 4881.64] Um, there was a whole thing
[4881.64 → 4883.16] this week when apparently
[4883.16 → 4884.54] Microsoft appeared
[4884.54 → 4885.82] to be not allowing
[4885.82 → 4887.66] YouTubers to put
[4887.66 → 4889.14] the title of a game
[4889.14 → 4889.78] in the name
[4889.78 → 4890.70] of their YouTube video.
[4890.82 → 4891.66] But they've clarified
[4891.66 → 4892.98] it's apparently
[4892.98 → 4893.76] not that big of a deal.
[4893.86 → 4894.48] You are apparently
[4894.48 → 4895.64] supposed to add a disclaimer
[4895.64 → 4896.34] in your description
[4896.34 → 4896.92] saying something
[4896.92 → 4897.70] along the lines of
[4897.70 → 4898.34] that the game
[4898.34 → 4899.14] was made by Microsoft
[4899.14 → 4899.66] and the video
[4899.66 → 4900.60] is not endorsed by them.
[4900.84 → 4901.60] There's official text
[4901.60 → 4902.04] for it.
[4902.34 → 4902.86] This was posted
[4902.86 → 4903.62] by Cobbs360
[4903.62 → 4904.28] on the forum.
[4904.54 → 4905.08] And you're not allowed
[4905.08 → 4905.76] to mislead people
[4905.76 → 4906.12] into thinking
[4906.12 → 4907.10] it's a Microsoft video,
[4907.38 → 4908.72] but I think that was
[4908.72 → 4909.74] just people freaking out
[4909.74 → 4910.74] over a wording issue.
[4910.90 → 4911.50] I'm glad Microsoft
[4911.50 → 4912.48] got it rectified.
[4912.74 → 4913.16] Pretty quick,
[4913.28 → 4913.70] to be honest.
[4913.78 → 4914.74] The main concern
[4914.74 → 4916.10] was that you couldn't
[4916.10 → 4917.24] call something like
[4917.24 → 4918.24] Red vs. Blue
[4918.24 → 4919.66] the Halo show
[4919.66 → 4920.96] or something along
[4920.96 → 4921.38] those lines.
[4921.44 → 4922.06] Like, using the
[4922.06 → 4922.98] trademark incorrectly,
[4923.12 → 4923.72] you had to come up
[4923.72 → 4924.78] with your own name
[4924.78 → 4925.50] if you were going
[4925.50 → 4925.94] to do something
[4925.94 → 4926.66] that was more
[4926.66 → 4927.18] along the lines
[4927.18 → 4927.86] of a show
[4927.86 → 4928.74] and less along
[4928.74 → 4929.24] the lines of
[4929.24 → 4929.96] strict gameplay
[4929.96 → 4930.96] or multiplayer footage.
[4931.04 → 4931.72] But you could do
[4931.72 → 4932.64] like a Halo gameplay
[4932.64 → 4933.28] and it would be fine.
[4933.60 → 4933.74] Yeah.
[4934.16 → 4934.94] As long as you have
[4934.94 → 4935.62] your disclaimer.
[4935.88 → 4936.02] Yep.
[4938.14 → 4939.70] LG had a nitrogen leak
[4939.70 → 4940.36] in their factory.
[4940.56 → 4941.70] This was the original
[4941.70 → 4942.48] articles from
[4942.48 → 4944.38] independent.co.uk.
[4944.94 → 4945.60] Let's go ahead
[4945.60 → 4946.28] and pull that up.
[4946.36 → 4947.52] Very, very unfortunate.
[4947.88 → 4948.84] Two were killed.
[4949.50 → 4950.80] Four have taken ill
[4950.80 → 4952.32] since the incident.
[4952.32 → 4954.54] Basically, not a whole
[4954.54 → 4955.32] lot is known.
[4955.68 → 4956.50] One of them died
[4956.50 → 4957.16] on the scene.
[4957.26 → 4958.24] One of them died
[4958.24 → 4959.04] on the way to
[4959.04 → 4960.88] the hospital.
[4961.80 → 4962.48] I mean, that's something
[4962.48 → 4963.28] that we often don't
[4963.28 → 4964.40] consider these
[4964.40 → 4965.50] electronic doodads
[4965.50 → 4966.86] that we enjoy so much
[4966.86 → 4967.58] is there's a lot of
[4967.58 → 4968.74] harmful and dangerous
[4968.74 → 4969.80] stuff that goes on
[4969.80 → 4970.90] in order to
[4970.90 → 4971.52] manufacture them.
[4972.52 → 4974.12] The NZXC Dock,
[4974.28 → 4974.98] this was posted by
[4974.98 → 4976.10] Brown Ninja on the forum.
[4976.22 → 4977.02] Original article here
[4977.02 → 4978.06] is from Tech Power Up.
[4978.36 → 4979.72] Promises 50 to 80
[4979.72 → 4981.00] milliseconds of latency
[4981.00 → 4983.10] and promises basically
[4983.10 → 4985.40] your computer experience
[4985.40 → 4986.78] on, well,
[4986.90 → 4987.82] anywhere you want
[4987.82 → 4988.44] on your TV.
[4988.82 → 4990.06] Luke has a review unit
[4990.06 → 4990.54] and I know he's
[4990.54 → 4991.36] planning to work on it
[4991.36 → 4992.06] maybe once you've got
[4992.06 → 4992.92] the motherboard roundup
[4992.92 → 4993.52] done or...
[4993.52 → 4994.26] I've got to do
[4994.26 → 4995.34] motherboard roundup
[4995.34 → 4996.72] and maybe one other thing
[4996.72 → 4997.58] and then I'll probably
[4997.58 → 4998.00] be on dodo.
[4998.36 → 4999.22] Yeah, looks cool.
[4999.36 → 5000.46] The only disadvantage
[5000.46 → 5001.16] right now,
[5001.26 → 5002.42] so it's got USB ports
[5002.42 → 5004.12] and it uses USB over IP
[5004.12 → 5004.86] in order to make it
[5004.86 → 5005.78] so if you plug in a keyboard
[5005.78 → 5006.76] it's basically like
[5006.76 → 5007.66] having that keyboard
[5007.66 → 5009.12] plugged into the computer
[5009.12 → 5009.56] you're using.
[5009.62 → 5010.72] I've been able to use it
[5010.72 → 5011.52] to a certain degree.
[5011.88 → 5012.56] Have you used it already?
[5013.08 → 5014.96] Not my own unit
[5014.96 → 5016.30] but I was able to use it
[5016.30 → 5016.92] while it was still
[5016.92 → 5018.04] under NDA at CES
[5018.04 → 5019.78] and the USB over IP
[5019.78 → 5020.78] is actually pretty
[5020.78 → 5021.46] freaking good.
[5021.68 → 5021.94] Cool.
[5022.14 → 5022.94] I was able to use
[5022.94 → 5023.58] a keyboard and mouse
[5023.58 → 5024.60] and I was able to use
[5024.60 → 5026.30] a flash drive
[5026.30 → 5027.92] and I was able to use a...
[5027.92 → 5028.80] They plugged in
[5028.80 → 5030.02] the Microsoft wireless
[5030.02 → 5031.04] dongle and then had me
[5031.04 → 5032.10] using a wireless controller
[5032.10 → 5033.06] which I was actually
[5033.06 → 5033.88] more worried about
[5033.88 → 5034.46] than just plugging
[5034.46 → 5035.40] in a controller directly
[5035.40 → 5036.82] but it worked totally fine.
[5036.92 → 5037.30] That's awesome.
[5037.56 → 5037.94] Pretty cool.
[5037.94 → 5040.04] It's only 1080p 30fps
[5040.04 → 5041.10] but I'm hoping
[5041.10 → 5042.86] that we'll see a Dou Extreme
[5042.86 → 5043.70] or Dou Plus
[5043.70 → 5044.82] or something along those lines
[5044.82 → 5046.52] one thing I can leak
[5046.52 → 5047.16] a little bit
[5047.16 → 5048.30] because it's not under
[5048.30 → 5049.06] NDA anymore
[5049.06 → 5049.64] is that
[5049.64 → 5052.72] the processing power
[5052.72 → 5053.40] and stuff in that unit
[5053.40 → 5055.38] is not exactly amazing.
[5055.68 → 5055.76] Right.
[5056.52 → 5057.60] And if there is
[5057.60 → 5058.64] a lot of interest shown
[5058.64 → 5059.84] they could release
[5059.84 → 5060.70] a higher end version
[5060.70 → 5062.48] which could do
[5062.48 → 5063.76] more FPS or whatever.
[5063.76 → 5065.76] so yeah.
[5066.42 → 5067.72] Tell them that you want one.
[5068.02 → 5068.32] Okay.
[5068.70 → 5069.68] Well I think that's pretty much
[5069.68 → 5070.74] it for the show today guys.
[5070.86 → 5071.48] Thank you so much
[5071.48 → 5072.20] for tuning in.
[5072.28 → 5073.28] We are planning to...
