[0.00 → 10.92] okay so I know it's been a while since we've said this because quite frankly most of the time
[10.92 → 16.34] lately there just really hasn't been any excuse for our lateness I think it's these lights
[16.34 → 18.08] that's why we're pale
[18.08 → 26.36] okay not what I was talking about at all but i you know I like your effort that's why
[26.36 → 33.96] you're still here it drives real hard folks real hard Brandon get other lights that don't make me
[33.96 → 40.84] look so dead a plus for effort um so I know I haven't said this in a while but really today
[40.84 → 48.02] we were like this close not to being on time but to being like pretty close to like five minutes
[48.02 → 52.72] off or something like it was actually okay we were about seven minutes late and basically I was
[52.72 → 59.82] dropping these sponsor spots into place and this is really weird like this is kind of cool
[59.82 → 67.98] because I got a first-hand look into the inner workings of the mind of Windows 10 um where
[67.98 → 75.22] XSplit the like the program window was here you know what I'll just uh oh I don't think I have
[75.22 → 81.92] a scene where I can screen share with you guys I will create one very quickly that's going to get
[81.92 → 88.38] okay so I could see picture that's going to lag out super hard uh that's a pretty good computer should
[88.38 → 100.70] be okay all right yeah task manage that ship 17 CPU you all yeah that's right 47 wow we put a 4770k in
[100.70 → 106.58] this and that was all on Paul and kyle's behalf if I recall correctly because we we were
[106.58 → 111.00] crap we the stream was dropping frames because we had two guests or something along those lines I think
[111.00 → 117.34] anyway, so the point is I could see my XSplit window it was kind of here I'm reenacting this for you guys
[117.34 → 122.48] and I could see us moving around and things moving in the frame and I could actually right-click on the
[122.48 → 130.36] desktop but I can number lock was working, but it was the most bizarre thing because I couldn't
[130.36 → 136.08] click anything start menu wasn't coming up and even pressing the front button was not resetting
[136.08 → 141.30] the computer but number lock was working I was like this computer's responding so I was like okay
[141.30 → 148.66] well hard shut down he's gonna Bork my windows again when just boot it up and the motherboard's
[148.66 → 155.90] all like oh your uh CSM boot settings it's stable you need to change these things to whatever if you
[155.90 → 162.96] want to do anything go into the secure boot settings I'm like oh not this again so I go and I go I set
[162.96 → 167.34] it to a bunch of things and then I set it to full auto and I reboot it again and i kind of go
[167.34 → 175.96] now just hold on a minute here my voice isn't quite back yet folks and I go into the actual boot
[175.96 → 181.90] devices and there's nothing in there no drive what do you mean no drive
[181.90 → 189.44] where's my drive why not say there's no boot device found right that's what my laptop was
[189.44 → 196.46] doing I'm using a john's laptop actually yeah my the ss the ms m SATA drive in my laptop died so I've
[196.46 → 201.50] swapped that anyway no big deal, but it was just like oh noob no boot device that's fine where was
[201.50 → 209.76] that error Asus so, so anyway so it takes me like 12 minutes or whatever to diagnose this so I'm
[209.76 → 215.66] i go down I look at the computer it's plugged in so i kind of go well that's what happened my SSD
[215.66 → 223.52] died while I was operating the computer I don't ask for much from this computer two hours a week
[223.52 → 230.44] it doesn't even go into sleep it shuts down everything but two hours a week and honestly
[230.44 → 235.98] it's only really supposed to be like an hour and a half a week, and it's on a up so like it gets the
[235.98 → 242.96] the best power in the building I ask for so little, and it's just no, no whatever Linus did you big old big
[242.96 → 250.70] old f you Linus because I hate you, and you know what I hate you too computer anyway new state of cable
[250.70 → 258.18] boots up we're ready to go, but we're late and on top of that I just wasted another five minutes
[258.18 → 263.64] explaining why we're late we haven't even intro topics making us even later unless you've watched
[263.64 → 268.44] it on YouTube you don't know what we're going to talk about I want a refund can you get that for this
[268.44 → 276.74] show on time oh wow I want a refund what does that even mean I don't know I don't know but what I do
[276.74 → 283.78] know is that porn hub released some stats from their site showing that their traffic compared to
[283.78 → 288.60] typical averages lowered immediately after the fallout 4 launch telling us something that I'm
[288.60 → 295.58] pretty sure we all know uh Tim Cook declares the end of the pc ushers in the age of the iPad Pro
[295.58 → 302.12] also Bradwell e specifications have leaked and Pokémon gen 1 is coming to 3ds
[302.12 → 311.90] 3ds intro time oh my god the intro worked the intro always works these days man
[311.90 → 314.94] wasn't it like two weeks ago that it didn't work
[314.94 → 319.40] this is so funny people are like 15 of the traffic was Luke
[319.40 → 321.40] hey I mean that's fair
[321.40 → 328.86] squarers
[328.86 → 334.58] squashes
[334.58 → 340.04] oh man i have to do something about that voice okay see this is the trick this is the trick
[340.04 → 347.70] if I make it blank now then it'll work next time i just always forget we should have a script that
[347.70 → 352.34] just does that you know what we should have is we should have like a checklist for the end of the
[352.34 → 357.56] show because I swear it has been a month since I've remembered to pull down the hey we're live
[357.56 → 364.74] tweet and Facebook post and then inevitably people are like hey how come you took down the
[364.74 → 373.54] archive okay for one the video is called we're live it is not called the wan show okay the wan show has
[373.54 → 383.54] been running for like two years the wan show has never been called we're live not once and number two
[383.54 → 388.26] I understand your confusion, and it's completely my bad this is my way of apologizing
[388.26 → 394.98] he likes to apologize by making you feel like it's your fault but then also admitting guilt in some
[394.98 → 403.14] way yes it's that way works best for everyone so let's get into it, you know I'm at that stage where
[403.14 → 409.62] I'm like feeling pretty much better, but there's like a gigantic boogie somewhere between like my nose
[409.62 → 415.30] and my throat like kind of in here somewhere and like it's like you can't you can't really do anything
[415.30 → 423.70] about it, I think I just swallowed it oh that's better or worse in other news about swallowing
[423.70 → 433.78] porn hub oh you know that doesn't happen much it could, but it's probably like a whole
[433.78 → 438.74] category for that probably actually I'm probably just missing the right keyword
[438.74 → 446.42] um all right, so this was posted originally on the forum by uh Sam fisher and the original source
[446.42 → 452.58] here is from venture beat let's go ahead and screen share with you guys so porn hubs traffic dipped
[452.58 → 462.26] significantly the day that fallout 4 came out confirming once and for all that gamers um
[463.14 → 470.58] who are on the internet sometimes on their computers might occasionally partake in the uh in the uh
[470.58 → 475.54] hub of porn website I think that's what it's called right hub of porn I wouldn't know much about it
[475.54 → 482.90] myself uh yeah, yeah okay how about porn website so okay in the time after the fallout right
[482.90 → 486.90] here I'm going to go back to this graph so in the time after the fallout release uh basically this is a
[486.90 → 494.66] traffic change among gamers specifically, so the actual dip is probably less significant because
[494.66 → 504.26] porn hub has actually used Google data in order to um segment their overall traffic into just
[504.26 → 512.18] the traffic that's also interested in gaming well that makes sense then which makes almost too groomed
[512.18 → 518.74] i I wish it was overall traffic nothing can be too groomed oh wow yes okay um I wish it was overall
[518.74 → 523.06] traffic not just gaming fans me to that would be a way more interesting statistic it would, I didn't
[523.06 → 528.02] realize that and that makes this way more boring yeah so, so anyway so-and-so the traffic change
[528.02 → 536.18] after the fallout 4 release you can see it was down as much as 10 percent however after looks like i
[536.18 → 543.70] don't know what three four five 15 or so hours of continuous gaming it was time for porn hub and
[543.70 → 551.06] then time to go to bed well that looks like on the first night they gamed a bit and then had a little
[551.06 → 556.58] no, no that's 4 a.m than 4 p.m so that's a 24-hour period you're looking at no, no it's a little more
[556.58 → 560.74] little more it's a 30 hour or so yeah, yeah so the first night it comes out they play a little bit
[560.74 → 565.62] then they're like i have to go work in the morning have some fun time go to sleep yeah work work do
[565.62 → 570.02] whatever do whatever do play again the next day and then now everyone's had a little
[570.02 → 575.14] bit more follow time so they're more inclined to spend a little bit of time before going to bed doing
[575.14 → 579.54] other things and then everyone's like okay whoop and then go back to bed okay, so this is probably
[579.54 → 590.98] going to be the worst straw poll we've ever done that's saying a lot um so does a hot new
[590.98 → 597.54] game release you should just go full bore and make it FAP on night one versus FAP on night two
[597.54 → 606.34] I'm not going to do that that's just no does a hot new game release affect your all right schedule
[607.38 → 614.98] so we're going to go with uh yes no and really those are the only options because there 's's not
[614.98 → 619.54] there's not really a lot to it beyond that so I'm going to go ahead and drop that in the twitch chat
[619.54 → 627.54] love to hear from you guys about this one I'm going to go ahead and vote okay oh wow the results
[627.54 → 634.74] are pouring in they're bouncing back, and they are wow this is the people are the the two wow
[634.74 → 642.18] everything is jockeying for position this is the tightest poll that we have ever run
[642.18 → 648.82] some might say warmest no one would say that but possibly not most inviting best groomed
[648.82 → 655.54] perhaps so we've got the majority of you it looks like it's settling in a little bit we've got the
[655.54 → 662.82] majority of you saying no a hot new game release is not enough to get you off of your schedule with uh
[662.82 → 670.10] a third of you saying yes indeed it would and uh 28 of you voting for turnip the way you know you should
[670.10 → 675.86] yep all right let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here I can't believe anyone even sponsors
[675.86 → 683.62] this show it's uh sort of horrible I mean it's great but in just sort of horrible way, or it's
[683.62 → 688.90] horrible greatly yeah I love this show all right so posted by z mule on the forum the original
[688.90 → 694.82] article here is from the telegraph you're posting links today right awesome okay we got this Tim click
[694.82 → 706.74] declares the end of the pc and hints at new medical product okay so uh I don't know wow that's great
[706.74 → 716.02] this article on telegraph has 1600 comments it's amazing how cyclical this whole argument ends up
[716.02 → 722.50] being um so anyway I'll give you guys some context for this so here's the here's the quote if you're
[722.50 → 729.46] looking at a pc this is uh Tim Cook why would you buy a pc anymore no really why would you buy one
[731.38 → 738.66] and then he continues um yes the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many
[738.66 → 745.78] many people they will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else oh right we
[745.78 → 751.38] make phones other than their phones I added that that bit about oh we make phones I guess we need to
[751.38 → 760.02] sell those too um the really weird thing here is apple also makes pcs pretty decent ones last time i
[760.02 → 768.66] checked and also last time I checked their pc market share was rising not lowering um I can't find rising
[768.66 → 775.14] falling not lowering I can't find the graph, but someone made an infography based on the people claiming
[775.14 → 780.98] that the pc was dead over time and I forgot I should have had that in here for this segment, but it's
[780.98 → 788.74] amazing because it's been going on since like a really long time ago like in like the crazy the pc
[788.74 → 794.42] space is exploding era people have been saying it since then so why don't we take turns answering uh Mr
[794.42 → 802.98] cook's question here um if you're looking at a pc why would you buy a pc anymore no really why would you buy
[802.98 → 809.22] one one answer at a time one answer at a time yeah you're you're first one's too easy
[809.22 → 815.06] well i I think there's a lot that are too easy actually so go ahead gaming okay gaming you can
[815.06 → 822.18] game on an iPad Pro it's no it's it's the job okay yeah no, no I am going to we have to take turns i
[822.18 → 826.98] want to play games that can't be played on an iPad Pro uh well then you should probably lobby that
[826.98 → 831.46] developer to develop for the iPad Pro the iPad Pro is extremely powerful because the game it's not
[831.46 → 836.26] powerful enough though it's not powerful enough okay all right so you want a machine that can
[836.26 → 845.62] game and is powerful all right I got argument number two maybe just maybe I want a peripheral
[845.62 → 851.54] that is not Bluetooth well you should probably and does not require an external like dongle you should
[851.54 → 856.42] probably learn to use modern peripherals you're just behind the times this is going to get confusing
[856.42 → 862.26] for my modern peripherals are just fine sir that is a stupid argument and mine is a good one you're
[862.26 → 870.58] next um i I need to uh have interesting input devices that I can't have on an iPad Pro that's
[870.58 → 876.66] basically mine rephrase try again no, no because of like capture cards and whatnot if I'm rendering I said
[876.66 → 881.38] I wanted peripheral devices that are not Bluetooth were you not talking about keyboard and mouse no
[881.38 → 886.34] it's just peripherals I could be a printer I could, it could be a printer okay printer's a peripheral
[886.34 → 895.46] okay um I don't know enough about the iPad Pro to be completely basically it's a big iPad, and it's faster
[897.70 → 903.22] what could you need to do with a pc that you can't do with an iPad all I really do with it is play games right
[903.22 → 908.34] oh okay well fine I'll come up with other things how about an external display okay what if I want to
[908.34 → 913.62] peripheral actually multitask okay arguably that is a peripheral so I'm repeating my own argument you
[913.62 → 919.54] said peripheral which took way too many things out of the argument maybe he's right maybe he's right
[919.54 → 924.82] what if I want to upgrade it what if I want to upgrade it, but that was part of the not fast enough
[924.82 → 930.02] thing oh, oh crap because we said it's not fast enough okay, and we said we want to be able to plug
[930.02 → 936.34] more things in we will come up with something and then games falls in under the same category okay I need
[936.34 → 943.06] access to my file system you can't do that on iPad Pro no it's just iOS I don't use them I don't
[943.06 → 948.34] know it's just a big iPad that's pathetic they have changed nothing it doesn't even have force touch
[948.34 → 955.54] I need massively expandable storage okay uh the cloud local no, no the cloud is the answer to
[955.54 → 959.94] everything I need it to be privately secure in fact the cloud is the answer to your gaming too cloud
[959.94 → 966.90] gaming cloud storage done I don't I don't accept that um I need to be able to play my games offline
[966.90 → 973.38] I need local secure I mean I think we've made our point I mean to try knew more about what people
[973.38 → 978.82] actually use iPads for I'd probably be able to have more arguments I think honestly that's a more
[978.82 → 983.78] interesting discussion at this point not what you can't do on an iPad because that's kind of an
[983.78 → 989.14] endless topic but what can you do on an iPad I don't use them I literally don't know what you can
[989.14 → 993.38] do on you can shop on Amazon you can check your email it's all the usual things I mean the main
[993.38 → 1000.42] difference here okay, and we can use this we can use this to springboard into you know what the iPad Pro
[1001.38 → 1008.02] is as much as anything else because and our my favourite iPad Pro review so far uh is this one over
[1008.02 → 1013.86] on over on Ars Technica where I think the headline pretty much says it mac like speed with
[1013.86 → 1021.70] all the virtues and restrictions of iOS because it does bring some interesting new peripherals to the
[1021.70 → 1028.90] table there is finally an apple sanctioned official keyboard cover and the similarity to something like
[1028.90 → 1037.94] a Surface Pro type cover is definitely a thing um, and they have the pencil which is a stylus
[1038.58 → 1044.74] but it is a device apparently you just use an iPad for porn yeah you can use a computer for porn
[1044.74 → 1049.78] yeah so it's one of those things where uh, and we'll talk more about steam OS later, but it's
[1049.78 → 1055.86] one of those things where i I don't especially with the way that it's priced which is kind of uh beating
[1055.86 → 1063.62] down the door of devices like a Surface Pro 4 and even apple's own macBook lineup um at the kind of
[1063.62 → 1072.58] price that it's at I just don't really understand why I'm taking a half-assed keyboard and no trackpad
[1073.38 → 1081.22] it does have the pencil so it does have a stylus, but it lacks any mouse even any mouse or trackpad input
[1081.22 → 1088.98] um I don't understand why I'm giving that up for the sake of I can attach the keyboard I guess
[1090.42 → 1095.86] and the screen is bigger I'm trying to watch people talk about what they actually use them for
[1095.86 → 1101.54] so far I got keep all my school books in one place which like so it's an e-book or a laptop
[1101.54 → 1110.10] okay one of the two yeah um porn yeah your phone yeah um well the screen's pretty small and that's
[1110.10 → 1119.06] like it so I mean to me this is not so much a problem with the with what Tim Cook is I think
[1119.06 → 1126.34] trying to say and that's that the iPad Pro is like everything that like uh where's that where's
[1126.34 → 1132.98] that other where's that other uh shoot where's that other quote I think this was technically video
[1132.98 → 1141.14] edit on an iPad Pro yeah so it's an it's not like any no everything he said is just kind of wrong
[1141.14 → 1147.86] he said okay yes the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many people
[1147.86 → 1153.54] and if you use it within the right narrowed scope yeah so I think to say that for many people
[1154.50 → 1159.30] and apple is oh no okay I shouldn't say apple because I meant the fruit not the company but in
[1159.30 → 1165.94] the context of this discussion that could be very confusing to say for many people a trackpad is
[1165.94 → 1173.70] a replacement for the mouse would be true because functionally you can kind of use them for the same
[1173.70 → 1183.86] stuff but i and this I've said this before when uh in my macBook 2015 retina review I've got stuff to
[1183.86 → 1192.10] do I need a mouse because it's faster and actually objectively better if you've like got stuff to do
[1192.10 → 1197.54] if I'm just hanging around watching YouTube videos on my computer I don't need a mouse because I'm not
[1197.54 → 1202.50] in a hurry I've got all the time in the world and I think that's kind of what's being said here yes the
[1202.50 → 1209.06] iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or desktop for many people if those people don't really have
[1209.06 → 1217.94] anything to do, or they're like they need something to sketch on but i I like I don't oh I don't
[1217.94 → 1224.34] understand why they're using this instead of like a Windows-based Wacom tablet which has already existed
[1224.34 → 1231.14] for a couple of years for people who legitimately want to use the fully featured adobe creative suite
[1231.14 → 1240.02] on a portable device with a legitimately excellent pen and digitizer experience with that said the
[1240.02 → 1247.06] overall feedback on apple's pencil stylus seems to be pretty good so far from reviews, but they're not
[1247.06 → 1252.66] out there in the wilderness and this is really crazy the iPad Pro is out, but the stylus is delayed
[1252.66 → 1259.30] again so you actually would just be buying a big iPad with a keyboard and I mean this is another
[1259.30 → 1263.54] thing going back to the keyboard like I don't really personally think that an extra couple inches
[1263.54 → 1270.26] on the screen no dramatically changes the iOS experience enough combined with a keyboard that
[1270.26 → 1276.90] this is a game-changing device I mean i personally this is something I think it makes it less usable i
[1277.54 → 1284.66] personally went through the experience of back in the iPad 2 days uh Logitech, and they actually have
[1284.66 → 1291.54] a new peripheral for the iPad Pro but Logitech had a Bluetooth keyboard slash hard aluminum cover
[1291.54 → 1299.06] really nice accessory for the iPad 2 I personally bought hundreds of them when I worked at NCI I like
[1299.06 → 1302.50] busted my butt I was like this thing is going to be a hot mover it takes everything that's great
[1302.50 → 1307.78] about the iPad and makes it so you can actually pipe on the damn thing that thing was a disaster
[1307.78 → 1315.94] it was so hard for me to get rid of them and so what people have changed their minds that much already
[1315.94 → 1329.06] I don't think so um so lots of people talking about oh uh sure oh there's one extra word uh
[1330.66 → 1337.62] so okay go for it um so lots of people in the chat are bringing up the horrible horrible horrible
[1337.62 → 1342.74] things that happened in Paris um yes wait oh are we done with the iPad thing are we completely
[1342.74 → 1346.10] changing okay we don't technically have to, but we've been talking about it for quite a while yeah
[1346.10 → 1352.34] okay so yeah yeah we're done so basically in short uh don't expect an iPad Pro review from me because
[1352.34 → 1358.34] I don't really care it is not a pc it does not replace a pc it's a big iPad and that'll be good for
[1358.34 → 1364.34] some things like in a classroom where a bigger thing to read a storybook to the kids on the iPad might be
[1364.34 → 1370.82] nice that's what I think it's for okay anyway um super important super terrible things happening in
[1370.82 → 1377.46] Paris uh yes we know um we're mainly not addressing it because we're probably not the right people
[1378.02 → 1384.10] we're addressing we're still a tech show yes I would, it is super important and if you do want
[1384.10 → 1388.98] to be informed I would very much recommend going and checking it out I know there's at least two of
[1388.98 → 1393.86] the top things on the front page of Reddit are about Paris right now those are probably good links to go
[1393.86 → 1398.50] get yourself informed I'm sure people in chat will probably be able to help you if you're looking
[1398.50 → 1404.34] for information um, and you'll be able to find it all over the internet it's a huge thing right now
[1404.82 → 1410.66] um but yes we are probably not the right people and I feel like if we spoke about it, we wouldn't be
[1410.66 → 1416.42] adding to the conversation for one and might accidentally spread misinformation which would be
[1416.42 → 1422.50] the worst thing to do right now so yeah maybe go check it out there are attacks and Paris has closed
[1422.50 → 1428.74] their borders um and yeah that's very much a developing thing right now so yeah
[1428.74 → 1434.74] I think it's safe for us to say you know our hearts go out to the people of Paris I love Paris that's
[1434.74 → 1440.02] actually the city that I chose that was my grad present as I could go anywhere in the world
[1440.74 → 1446.90] for I think it was like 10 days or something like that also I had to take my mother um and I went to
[1446.90 → 1451.94] Paris, and it was freaking awesome and people should not attack Paris I think we can all agree on that
[1451.94 → 1460.90] yeah all right so moving back to tech news uh intel's sky lake speed shift technology has been
[1461.62 → 1466.90] deployed now this is stuff that was built into the CPU back when it was released this was posted on the
[1466.90 → 1473.54] forum by unlock 21 uh the article here is from anon tech but basically what this amounts to
[1473.54 → 1483.06] is a more advanced kind of a more granular version of the speed step technology that already
[1483.06 → 1490.74] existed that allows the CPU to dynamically adjust its power and speed settings as it's being used so
[1493.78 → 1502.26] uh, so this is cool so in the past the operating system was fully in control of this process and the CPU
[1502.26 → 1508.90] itself was just capable of all these different power states now with operating system support and
[1508.90 → 1514.82] this has been added to Windows 10 the OS can actually hand control of the frequency and voltage
[1514.82 → 1522.82] back to the processor so in short there's uh there's an intel provided graph here that graphed excuse me
[1522.82 → 1529.78] graph here that shows with speed shift enabled how quickly it can cycle up to different power states so
[1529.78 → 1536.26] you can see the I believe this is frequency yep, so this is frequency versus time in milliseconds we are
[1536.26 → 1543.78] talking getting from uh a low lower power state to the highest one in a matter of what is this like
[1545.94 → 1553.38] 15 milliseconds or something along those lines that's pretty solid versus about 120 milliseconds without
[1553.38 → 1559.54] speed shift enabled, so this is going to be particularly important for things like mobile processors
[1559.54 → 1564.58] where the difference between your base clock and your very low power steps when you've got speed step
[1564.58 → 1568.98] at It's very lowest states to say battery, so this is going to make a big difference to the
[1568.98 → 1574.34] responsiveness of tasks when that mobile processor that has a huge disparity between its base and its
[1574.34 → 1580.02] boost clock is able to quickly go okay you're doing something boom I'm done and oh now I'm way back down so
[1581.30 → 1589.30] you know say for example when you're navigating to a web page that puts a very short very sudden very, very short
[1589.54 → 1595.94] term load on the processor and now that will be able to take better advantage of the actual power
[1595.94 → 1600.74] that you've got under the hood of your device than was possible in the past which can give you
[1600.74 → 1607.30] responsiveness in little tight timings which can actually make your computer feel a lot faster than it
[1607.30 → 1614.42] actually the change actually is yeah responsiveness is more important than you know how quickly can you
[1614.42 → 1619.54] render out you know a video that is going to take either a half an hour or 35 minutes or whatever
[1619.54 → 1625.30] which is awesome but like that five minutes will feel like a much shorter period of time than when
[1625.30 → 1628.98] because you'll probably go do something yeah um compared to if you're sitting there literally
[1628.98 → 1633.46] staring at the screen waiting for something to load, so this is cool this tells us a little bit about
[1633.46 → 1639.30] it so anon tech ran pc mark 8 because somehow they managed to get that bloody program to run I swear like
[1639.30 → 1646.26] like, and you know what we must just be snake bitten because I love future mark those guys are nice and
[1646.26 → 1652.82] I love most of the software that they make but pc mark man every single time people often ask
[1652.82 → 1660.42] me why don't you run pc mark on like your laptop reviews and stuff maybe 10 to 20 maybe 30 of the time
[1660.42 → 1666.42] that I've just sat down and gone okay I'm going to run pc mark it has worked for a while I was actually using
[1666.42 → 1672.10] the battery life test in my notebook videos so i I used it in I think two and then I went to use it
[1672.10 → 1679.14] for the uh the dell rugged uh laptop and it just three times just it failed just like would stop
[1679.14 → 1683.70] working it would just the computer would go to sleep when the device still had 40 battery I'm just like
[1683.70 → 1688.50] this is not useful every time we get to scrapyard wars we get to deciding on one of those styles of
[1688.50 → 1694.74] tests I'm just like uh oh dear we went through what three different versions of pc mark to find one that
[1694.74 → 1700.98] to find one that we managed to run and even then I think we oh I'm this is spoilers okay stay tuned
[1700.98 → 1706.50] for more scrapyard wars how is it still coming out it's still coming I'm on the fan side on this one
[1706.50 → 1713.46] it's way too long you know what it was one of those things where it ended up being a result of us taking
[1713.46 → 1721.22] the whole thing and going okay what's good here because a lot of the time stuff that was good enough
[1721.22 → 1726.02] to make it into this version ended up on the cutting room floor because of just time constraints
[1726.02 → 1731.86] last time so I think the haphazard approach almost worked better the problem was because it was too
[1731.86 → 1736.98] light and then last time had its own whole set of problems I know so like we decided on this before
[1736.98 → 1741.14] we so we'll reevaluate, and we'll take another crack at it and that's pretty much all there is to it
[1741.14 → 1745.78] all right um, so anyway there are some more benchmarks for speed shift that show that in some cases it does
[1745.78 → 1752.34] make a very significant difference uh in other cases it's much smaller um but yeah there you go
[1753.14 → 1757.54] battery efficiency ever so slightly improved I love those in on tech guys they do such a good job
[1757.54 → 1762.66] this is all good stuff yeah all good stuff it's not it's not a's I doubt it's going to be a major
[1762.66 → 1769.38] game-changing thing but like it's cool uh what's interesting is that the OS can relinquish not
[1769.38 → 1775.94] necessarily all but just some of the power state um some of the power states so it could control it
[1775.94 → 1780.98] within this range or that range or the whole thing that's cool very cool stuff yeah do you know if
[1780.98 → 1787.54] you're going to have to enable this or is it automatically running that I actually don't know I'm assuming on
[1787.54 → 1794.18] the CPU side it's probably enabled by default I suspect it works on its own I cannot tell you the only
[1794.18 → 1801.06] thing that made me think of that is because you said it can do this or that all right, so this is
[1801.06 → 1808.74] interesting I mean this is something where it doesn't look like anyone can get any comment from um
[1810.18 → 1819.30] here we go uh from the director of whatever kind of yeah I think it's unlikely that they could have
[1819.30 → 1827.54] uh did we intro the topic at all no, no we didn't, so basically word on the street is that the FBI paid
[1827.54 → 1836.10] Carnegie Mellon one million dollars at least this is all very he said she said to break tour so the
[1836.10 → 1841.86] original article that we have here this is posted by that speed on the forum the original article and uh
[1841.86 → 1849.30] there's the full speed uh full-size ad is from forbs here and so the tor project is the one claiming
[1849.30 → 1857.86] this um and the objective they are saying was that was for the FBI to uncloak particular users
[1857.86 → 1865.06] and find their true IPS, so this is the team responsible for maintaining the tor anonymizing
[1865.06 → 1869.94] network, and they're claiming that they paid one million to disclose techniques that they discovered
[1869.94 → 1875.46] that could help uncover the identities of users neither the FBI nor Carnegie Mellon have directly
[1875.46 → 1882.02] confirmed nor denied anything there was a talk uh that was supposed to be a black hat 2014 that was
[1882.02 → 1887.46] cancelled um from two researchers their names are in here somewhere that were from Carnegie Mellon
[1887.46 → 1893.30] uh that talk was cancelled and was directly pertaining to this kind of things and people are wondering if
[1893.30 → 1898.82] that talk was kind of bought out by the FBI so it wasn't released and then the things that they were
[1898.82 → 1905.94] talking about in there were released and that talk was about um being able to un un UN anonymize these
[1905.94 → 1913.38] people and find the hidden services which is exactly what was done so they do actually seem pretty well related
[1913.38 → 1924.26] yep um so I guess that's pretty much all there is to really yeah to really say about it but ed I don't know how to say your last name ed desk
[1924.26 → 1932.02] does it is ed desk tells the suites can I help you out tools I can say that name
[1933.70 → 1939.46] desk yeah it looks like a French name spokesman for Carnegie Mellon software engineering institute did not
[1939.46 → 1944.74] deny the accusations directly but told wired I would like to see the substantiation for their claim adding
[1944.74 → 1950.98] I am not aware of any payment which is like basically like saying I can't say anything yeah
[1951.94 → 1957.94] yeah um the site motherboard reviewed the court filings reviewed court filings that proved the FBI
[1957.94 → 1963.30] recruited a research institute that was running systems on tor networks to uncover the identity
[1963.30 → 1969.86] of a user of Silk Road 2. so that's the drug marketplace that replaced the first version of the Silk Road
[1969.86 → 1979.30] and um yeah I guess that's pretty much all there is to say about that so nowhere is safe yay, yay although
[1979.30 → 1985.14] that's why you should run a local cloud unlike that thing you can do on an iPad which is using other
[1985.14 → 1992.50] clouds oh wow boy um I guess i kind of we actually had a separate well you know what it's probably worth
[1992.50 → 1997.46] going through we had a separate topic for the iPad Pro I did cover a lot of this though when I was kind
[1997.46 → 2002.42] of ranting about it before, but there are some good things about it iPad Pro again bro yeah, so this is
[2002.42 → 2007.70] supposed to buy dad speed well it's kind of a big deal because it replaces desktops and laptops
[2007.70 → 2012.98] that means like our jobs yeah I know right we'll just have to make videos about the iPad Pro all day
[2012.98 → 2014.98] dude I can put the iPad Pro in a bomb
[2014.98 → 2025.30] okay that will make more sense if you've watched his fallout 4 build block
[2027.62 → 2034.66] yeah um anyway, so there is some cool stuff so the a9x processor uh the same one that was found in the
[2034.66 → 2041.94] iPhone 6s has now been overclocked just another way of saying the clock speed has been increased so
[2041.94 → 2050.26] it's now even faster and actually quite competitive with um intel's real processors like we're not
[2050.26 → 2056.82] talking core m it's legitimately looking pretty competitive with you know a low-end core i3 core
[2056.82 → 2062.82] i5 dual-core pretty darn interesting stuff and this is based on some browser-based benchmarks as well as
[2062.82 → 2069.46] geek bench it also shows little sign of throttling in the geek bench thermal test pretty darn impressive
[2069.46 → 2074.66] and with the larger battery thanks to the larger housing it's able to achieve pretty darn similar
[2074.66 → 2082.50] battery life to previous iPads again a very good result the onboard graphics are looking very
[2082.50 → 2090.98] favourable beating every previous i device and every intel GPU up to and including the iris pro 5200
[2090.98 → 2097.86] and intel HD 520 it does not feature 3d touch something that I'm personally pretty disappointed in
[2097.86 → 2106.18] brutal 3d touch is actually awesome yeah apple's done a pretty good job in the past of of of maintaining
[2106.18 → 2110.34] their new features sort of across the product line as they refresh them um and I would have really
[2110.34 → 2115.78] expected that and this is especially disappointing given that this is a device that it's so funny
[2115.78 → 2121.70] because apple is always running around saying well no touch screens for our macBooks because that's awkward
[2121.70 → 2130.66] so this is a device where we're expected to type and touch it yeah um, and they're actually taking
[2130.66 → 2137.46] away input options from the touch from the touch input multitasking is still quite limited um because
[2137.46 → 2143.06] it's running iOS it takes around four and a half hours to completely recharge with the included charge
[2143.06 → 2149.38] where if not in use um thanks to its high capacity battery, and it starts at 800 us dollars
[2149.38 → 2158.02] uh the keyboard is 169 for a keyboard accessory and the stylus is a hundred dollars so you've spent
[2158.02 → 2164.74] over a thousand dollars by the time you get even a base 32 gig Wi-Fi model basically I wouldn't
[2164.74 → 2170.26] recommend buying it um I've had some pretty I've given some pretty positive reviews to Apple devices in
[2170.26 → 2176.18] the last little while um including the iPhone 6s but this one really great on the phone side especially
[2176.18 → 2181.54] with and like part of the reason why they're doing, so great is that android is just doing terribly
[2182.10 → 2188.74] in terms of like security stuff yeah security stuff uh OS updates um customer support there's
[2188.74 → 2194.10] a lot of things wrong with android right now um I'm super pleased with my new phone uh those of you
[2194.10 → 2199.14] who aren't following on vessel won't know this yet but I have officially switched to the Peria z5
[2199.14 → 2204.42] compact I have done away with the droid turbo it has officially happened after 11 months
[2204.98 → 2209.38] like you're actually going to switch that's done wow I'm done I'm done with the droid turbo I think
[2209.38 → 2214.02] Terran wants to buy it so that would be a good upgrade for Terran yeah yeah he needs uh he needs
[2214.02 → 2218.98] a phone with a camera that works, so the droid turbo is definitely that all right let's move on to some
[2218.98 → 2226.34] intel news the Bradwell e upcoming Bradwell e specifications have been leaked this was posted by
[2226.34 → 2234.10] Mr troll on the forum whose name is appropriate given that it's a news item on Ltd forum linking to
[2234.10 → 2243.78] CCF tech, so there's actually if this is true and what I will give CCF tech and many of the other
[2243.78 → 2251.86] rumour mill sites out there what I will give them is that typically intel CPU rumours tend to be pretty
[2251.86 → 2261.30] good um intel is a very, very structured company and generally speaking their roadmaps like back when
[2261.30 → 2269.30] I was working at a retailer the roadmaps are pretty far out and like if is is they are is they
[2269.30 → 2277.46] are going to be arriving I think what was it q1 2016 uh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[2277.46 → 2287.86] later in 2016. Later in 2016. So the uh the Bradwell EP eons are rumoured for q1 2016 with the consumer
[2287.86 → 2294.02] grade ones coming I think it was later in 2016. So it would not be unlike intel to have a year out
[2294.02 → 2298.50] roadmap that they're showing potential partners under NDA but of course how long does it take for
[2298.50 → 2305.38] CCF tech to get their hands on that so in a nutshell we are looking at once again man it seems like
[2305.38 → 2312.42] it took forever for them to get past giving us six cores on that platform, but we are getting another
[2312.42 → 2317.62] two cores for the top end extreme edition cool freaking stuff one of the coolest parts though is
[2317.62 → 2323.94] that you can get an eight core non-extreme edition yes so the top end thousand dollar processor is
[2323.94 → 2332.50] rumoured to be rocking 10 cores and 20 threads at 3 gigahertz so uh we're looking at a basically
[2332.50 → 2338.74] equivalent single threaded performance in all likelihood with essentially in heavily multithreaded
[2338.74 → 2344.50] workloads that's three gigahertz uh non-turbo yeah non-turbo, and we don't know the turbo, and we don't
[2344.50 → 2350.34] know turbo clocks um so effectively whatever sort of 25 performance improvement in heavily threaded
[2350.34 → 2355.14] workloads not bad from generation to generation heck of a lot better than the consumer stuff
[2355.78 → 2363.14] yay we're getting treated like enthusiasts again um and then this is even more interesting sort of
[2363.14 → 2367.86] except that we don't know pricing yet and that is that of the so the 6950x is the extreme edition the
[2367.86 → 2375.14] 6900k is apparently going to have eight cores and 16 threads yeah so you won't have to buy an extreme
[2375.14 → 2379.22] edition to get the eight core experience which is awesome but again yeah we don't know the price tag
[2379.22 → 2384.18] we don't know the price probably pretty easy to guess well I would have said that except that this
[2384.18 → 2391.54] time around intel is going to have four skews in the enthusiast stack so for the last couple of
[2391.54 → 2401.78] generations like three generations 3960x, and then it was 3930k 3820k then we had the 4960x 4930k
[2401.78 → 2411.70] 4920k and in both of those cases I believe they were all it was six core eight four core
[2411.70 → 2416.34] no six core four cores I think something along those lines anyway so this time we get 10 core
[2416.34 → 2422.26] four okay so right 5960x is eight core and then both of the lower ones are six core right there
[2422.26 → 2427.78] was no cheap quad-core previously that's right they were six cores or uh or that sorry
[2427.78 → 2433.86] there's the cheap one is not a quad-core this time uh six core so this time you get a 10 core
[2433.86 → 2439.78] or an eight core and then there is no quad-core very nice so you get definitely something for your
[2439.78 → 2446.18] money investing in a x99 motherboard and quad-core memory uh quad-core quad channel memory so this
[2446.18 → 2452.02] time you definitely get at least two more cores for your money, and you could get up to also six
[2452.66 → 2461.14] or eight or 10. But we don't know what the pricing is going to look like and I wouldn't be that surprised
[2461.14 → 2468.10] to see intel pull another q6600 on us here so back when they launched their first quad-core extreme
[2468.10 → 2475.94] edition the ex 6700 what happened was they initially launched the q6600 which was their first non-extreme
[2475.94 → 2483.30] quad-core at like 750 or something like that like it was quite expensive so I wouldn't be surprised
[2483.30 → 2491.06] to see that and then another lower end six core with kind of the other six core sitting in between
[2491.06 → 2499.38] that massive price gap that now exists between the 5820k and the 5930k and the other thing we don't know
[2499.38 → 2506.42] yet here is how PCI Express lanes are going to be handled so right now while we do get a six or
[2506.42 → 2511.22] an eight core regardless of how much we spend that bottom tier six core instead of having two fewer
[2511.22 → 2518.18] cores has 12 fewer PCI e lanes for worse expansion if you want to add a bunch of a bunch of cards to it
[2518.18 → 2528.10] so what I'm guessing is we're going to see that low end 6800k be six cores and fewer PCI e lanes I think
[2528.10 → 2533.22] we're going to get a six core with all the PCI e lanes in between like that new one that didn't
[2533.22 → 2537.22] exist before that new price point then we're going to have eight cores with all lanes then we're going
[2537.22 → 2542.18] to have 10 cores with all lanes um so that's that's kind of what it looks like to me
[2544.26 → 2552.42] I'm really super stoked on Bradwell EP though as some of you probably know I have been getting I've been
[2552.42 → 2559.38] getting more and more into Leon stuff and like enjoying all the cores, and you know whether it's
[2559.38 → 2565.06] using them for our video editing workflow or whether it's using them for running virtual machines where
[2565.06 → 2570.90] we took two gamers running on one motherboard which is pretty freaking cool um so this is this
[2570.90 → 2576.50] is looking interesting and this uh the official launch is apparently targeted for q1 2016 so this is
[2576.50 → 2588.98] e5 2600v4 up to 22 cores and 44 threads with up to 55 megabytes of cash per chip holy actual freaking
[2588.98 → 2597.70] balls not to mention that memory speed goes up from 2133 to 2400 so we're talking a dual socket machine with
[2597.70 → 2605.70] up to 44 cores I mean I thought it was bananas when we did our 36 core machine I wonder what excuse I could
[2605.70 → 2614.10] find to tell intel that I need 222 cores I'm going to have to come up with something wait don't you already
[2614.10 → 2621.54] have this no I've got 218 course what about that oh no those are okay so I do have okay so I've been
[2621.54 → 2627.78] teasing this for a bit okay we're changing topics a little bit here so without revealing too much
[2628.58 → 2634.74] I'm going to be building a very interesting machine um it will contain keep going I'm just
[2634.74 → 2646.18] seven r9 fury Naxos it will contain two 14 core eons it will contain 256 gigabytes of memory
[2646.74 → 2652.10] and it's all going to be on an Asus workstation motherboard uh the rest of the specs are sort of
[2652.10 → 2657.86] TBD right now um because if i I think if I said anything about the rest of what I'm putting in it might
[2657.86 → 2664.18] reveal too much about the project but expect that project to show up probably sometime around the end of
[2664.18 → 2669.30] this year because let me tell you it takes a little while to get all of that hardware coordinated and
[2669.30 → 2673.46] it's going to take a fair bit of testing and configuration for me to get this whole thing
[2673.46 → 2679.78] working so my CPUs are here the ram arrived today the video cards are due next Wednesday and the
[2679.78 → 2685.38] motherboard is Asus doesn't communicate i just kind of go hey I need this motherboard and then like
[2685.94 → 2690.74] three weeks later it shows up in the mail and I'm like okay hey we got it awesome we'll do that

[2899.06 → 2905.54] see if they've put our headshots on linusmediagroup.com they're probably not there I'm sure they're not
[2905.54 → 2914.34] there how is that still oh nope they're not there this is so funny this is so what we do is
[2914.34 → 2921.22] massively outdated i know it's like shoot is so I know so what else do we do wow oh dear
[2921.22 → 2927.62] an unboxing we straight up don't even do them anymore actually you know what do we do any of these things
[2928.18 → 2931.94] so we no longer do commercial production yeah I don't remember the last time we did one
[2931.94 → 2939.70] me neither we don't do unboxing we do reviews we do event coverage although this overclocking
[2939.70 → 2946.10] event was a long time ago yeah uh we do sponsored projects things like our the fallout 3 build that
[2946.10 → 2951.86] you follow excuse me fallout 4 build blog you just did shots fired and okay how many of these do we
[2951.86 → 2958.02] still work with it's been a long time for steel series we haven't worked with Samsung in over a year
[2958.02 → 2964.50] we haven't worked with links since their very first sponsorship of our trip to CES three years
[2964.50 → 2972.34] ago uh we definitely don't work with hotspot shield anymore in fact that brings us very tidally into
[2972.34 → 2980.18] our next sponsor tunnel bear yeah there were a number of reasons actually there are a number of reasons
[2980.18 → 2987.30] whenever we drop a sponsor that we end up doing it yes one of them is related to complaints from our
[2987.30 → 2992.18] viewers when we get complaints we don't work with our sponsor anymore unless they have a perfect
[2992.18 → 2997.94] reason or unless they address it very well so start browsing today privately at tunnelbear.com

[3074.74 → 3079.38] uh the rest of the show here what else are we supposed to talk about today I don't even know
[3079.38 → 3084.66] there's Pokémon oh yeah Pokémon there's your tax rebellion thing no this is actually okay this is
[3084.66 → 3088.74] fascinating okay he hasn't read this but I believe you this is by posted by trick starry on the
[3088.74 → 3096.58] forum of course it was our resident of tinfoil hatware this is such a topic for you, I know no it's
[3096.58 → 3100.42] actually no it's its it's legitimately pretty interesting so no I'm just saying this just
[3101.06 → 3106.98] it smells like so the Welsh town crick Howell which is a great name for a town by the way moves
[3107.54 → 3116.02] offshore to avoid tax what on local business what okay, so this is led by some traders including the
[3116.02 → 3124.10] town's salmon smokers local coffee shop bookshop optician and bakery what and this tax rebellion
[3124.10 → 3133.38] could spread nationwide now if it's important to be very clear what they are doing they are not
[3133.38 → 3140.18] trying to evade taxes for the sake of evading taxes they uh, uh said blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[3140.18 → 3146.66] up until now blah blah blah blah etc etc etc okay I can't find the quote that I was reading uh but
[3146.66 → 3154.42] basically that is not the point the these are these are people who presumably at least some
[3154.42 → 3159.94] of them okay proudly pay their taxes to support their country and the public services that they use
[3160.50 → 3166.82] I pay a lot of taxes personally and through the business I pay lots and lots of taxes because I've
[3166.82 → 3172.26] been working since I was legal age to work with absolutely zero interruptions having always paid my
[3172.26 → 3177.86] taxes and I am proud of that I am proud to support the social programs that we have here in Canada
[3177.86 → 3182.66] that take that tax money that I pay and build a road that not only I can drive on but everyone can
[3182.66 → 3189.78] drive on that is the way the system is supposed to work is the system broken yes the system is broken
[3189.78 → 3194.98] there are many significant issues in Canada and in many other countries pretty much everywhere
[3194.98 → 3200.10] there are many significant issues that exist with the way that taxpayer money gets spent oh yeah but
[3200.10 → 3205.46] it's a heck of a lot better than anarchy, and so I continue to support it happily and I do not go
[3205.46 → 3210.90] out of my way to evade any taxes and I'm proud of that so that's not what these guys are doing either
[3211.54 → 3218.66] their point and this is great one of the town's traders discovered that he paid seven times
[3218.66 → 3229.06] more in corporation tax last year than Facebook which paid five thousand pounds in corporation tax
[3229.70 → 3239.62] that is their point is if this loophole is here then fine we're going to use it, and you got
[3239.62 → 3244.98] two options option number one is okay well we're gonna play by those rules, and we don't pay taxes
[3244.98 → 3252.82] any more we pay very, very small offshore company taxes or option number two is tax those guys they
[3252.82 → 3260.74] should be paying tax too um they super should, and it's so this loophole uh allowed the likes of Amazon
[3260.74 → 3269.94] to pay 11.9 million on 5.3 billion of UK internet sales yeah amazon.co.uk is sort of a big site I think
[3269.94 → 3278.50] that's worded oddly I think they're paying taxes on 11.9 million of 5.3 billion of sales what no taxes of
[3278.50 → 3283.86] 11.9 million on 5.3 billion of sales okay yeah yeah that's right don't worry it's its all good
[3284.58 → 3290.82] um I don't know what I don't know what ghost is doing he's drunk okay that's why I was assuming
[3290.82 → 3296.98] there was something wrong anyway the point is um what Joe earth who runs the local smokers said
[3296.98 → 3302.90] is that until now complicated offshore tricks have only been open to big companies who can afford the
[3302.90 → 3310.10] lawyers fees now we've worked out a way to mimic them, and they're basically uh this is going to be
[3310.10 → 3315.78] a part of a documentary in 2016 as part of BBC Britain's black economy season, and they're basically
[3315.78 → 3322.74] going okay here's how to do it so we're starting tax rebellion if you want to collect any taxes from
[3322.74 → 3327.86] businesses maybe it's time to start collecting taxes from everyone in a fair and equitable manner
[3327.86 → 3336.74] I love it this article made me so happy because it makes absolutely no sense that these companies
[3336.74 → 3343.06] are gonna you know threaten the government and go oh well we'll just we'll just
[3343.06 → 3348.34] like stop paying our lobbying dollars, and we'll just we'll move our operations out if you make us
[3348.34 → 3357.54] paid taxes i realistically I don't see that happening, but it takes multiple governments
[3357.54 → 3364.26] forming a united front against this behaviour in order to make it work, and so i I do sincerely worry
[3364.26 → 3370.74] that it might not be possible I don't know I don't know because it's I mean yeah if you're is you're
[3370.74 → 3377.94] apple is it cheaper for you to pay tax properly on all your income or is it cheaper for you to offer
[3377.94 → 3384.98] the entirety of your Silicon Valley campuses a massive relocation bonus to move to Canada or move to
[3384.98 → 3392.34] somewhere else yeah i I don't know like I don't know I don't know how far this would escalate
[3392.34 → 3396.34] before it ended and I don't know what the landscape would look like when it was over
[3397.46 → 3404.98] um oh this is actually I have to confess I had not heard of this, so this was posted on the
[3404.98 → 3411.38] forum by oh no I don't have a forum post this is just an Ars Technica link so beware of ads that use
[3411.38 → 3418.98] inaudible sound to link your phone TV tablet and pc, so privacy advocates warn the feds about
[3418.98 → 3426.18] surreptitious cross device tracking this is some crappy stuff going on right here yeah and I hadn't
[3426.18 → 3433.62] heard of this before if is you're running software on a smart device so basically as far as I can tell
[3433.62 → 3438.50] that's anything that can have an app installed on it that can have silver push software running at the
[3438.50 → 3444.74] same time yeah um that would be able to listen so a microphone of some sort so probably your phone
[3444.74 → 3451.86] or a tablet but probably your phone um then that silver push software can be the audio beacon and
[3451.86 → 3456.50] different devices in your house so your computer if you have speakers on it your TV most likely in
[3456.50 → 3461.94] the middle of a commercial can have yes uh would be playing extremely high-pitched noises I'd be
[3461.94 → 3465.86] interested to see if that's a frequency that dogs can hear yeah I wonder if the dogs freak out when they
[3465.86 → 3471.46] your dog would be like you're being spied up like yeah yeah exactly your dog's like no dog meat will
[3471.46 → 3477.54] save you um anyway follow for reference um it's going to play this crazy sound that you can't hear
[3477.54 → 3483.38] but that your smart device that has silver push software on could kind of pick it up so that they
[3483.38 → 3489.46] can track if people are seeing these things yeah, so this will tell advertisers oh man this will tell
[3489.46 → 3496.42] data miners so much more about you personally than was possible before because I mean we talked
[3496.42 → 3501.70] about this let's talk about the iPad Pro again there are certain things that make sense to do on a
[3501.70 → 3509.06] tablet and there are certain things that don't make sense to do on a tablet so for example if an advertiser
[3509.06 → 3514.74] uh let's say let's say oh I don't know let's say google okay let's say you don't use chrome on your desktop
[3514.74 → 3521.30] but you use chrome on your iPad so if all that google knows about you is that you uh read game
[3521.30 → 3528.98] reviews, and you go to porn hub then they'll go okay gamer porn enthusiast, and they might, you know
[3528.98 → 3534.26] try to figure out based on some you know uh emails you send here and there how old you are and what
[3534.26 → 3538.42] your gender is and all that kind of stuff so they've created a profile for you but what they might not
[3538.42 → 3545.86] know about you is that you watch um yeah and win that you love watching mad men on TV and that you're
[3545.86 → 3552.26] whether you mute the ads that's right whether so there's all these things that they
[3552.26 → 3557.30] that they can't know about you unless they know all about your devices and the example given in the
[3557.30 → 3563.78] Ars Technica article which was excellent was maybe you would research STDs on your computer and then
[3563.78 → 3570.26] search for an um you know and you know an an an a sexual health clinic on your phone and then you would
[3570.26 → 3576.34] travel there and come back and then like now all of a sudden it could go okay you had a STD you went
[3576.34 → 3581.30] and got treated and now your back home and maybe you're better now or maybe you're not, and it can
[3581.30 → 3587.22] continue to track your searches like being able to track you across devices raises some serious privacy
[3587.22 → 3593.54] concerns um especially because tracking you across devices tells them exactly who you are there's
[3593.54 → 3600.82] pretty much no way to anonymously submit data like I went here I went there I live here um it's not
[3600.82 → 3606.18] it's not anonymous anymore and this is the scariest thing about it silver pushes software is used by 67
[3606.18 → 3612.42] apps and which we don't know what those apps are but totals 18 million smartphones yeah, and they've
[3612.42 → 3618.90] basically what they basically said is it is against our policy to disclose what apps are using our technology
[3618.90 → 3627.46] so rip any app that asks for your microphone and speaker permissions potentially I don't know
[3628.10 → 3637.94] any of 67 apps dun dun dun yeah all right original poster here is tantra and the original article is
[3637.94 → 3644.26] from Ars Technica once again I love Ars Technica so this is so funny this is so funny I called this on
[3644.26 → 3652.18] wan show last week I was like it will take no time flat for the Linux army to attack my steam machine
[3652.18 → 3658.02] review and tell me about how I'm missing the point because you can enable desktop mode and the blah blah
[3658.02 → 3664.18] blah Linux master race etc um so it took like a matter of minutes and I actually tweeted about it when it
[3664.18 → 3671.14] happened, but someone said something along the lines of oh crap anyway one of their points was that Linux game
[3671.14 → 3676.18] performance and steam OS game performance is actually very similar to windows when I used the
[3676.18 → 3682.50] word significant performance tax or significant performance penalty or something along those lines
[3682.50 → 3688.82] um a that wasn't my point in the video at all because what I was really talking about was the steam
[3688.82 → 3697.14] machines uh how successful the steam machine was at targeting the demographic that valve seems to be
[3697.14 → 3702.82] targeting with it so it was completely I didn't even run any performance numbers, and you're wrong about
[3702.82 → 3708.26] the other thing because whether it's Linux we're talking about or whether it is driver issues the
[3708.26 → 3712.18] performance tax so they were saying there was no performance tax or it wasn't significant the word i
[3712.18 → 3718.74] used was significant which has a very specific meaning by the way um it is significant middle earth
[3718.74 → 3726.26] shadow of Mordor ouch huge that's so brutal um so whether it's drivers actually I thought there were oh yeah
[3726.26 → 3732.34] no there are more uh middle earth shadow of Mordor the medium settings one or actually ultra settings
[3732.34 → 3735.22] is very interesting but I don't know how many people are going to run it on that because it brings it
[3735.22 → 3740.42] from a very playable frame rate to a not very playable frame rate but the one that I like looking at the
[3740.42 → 3746.90] most is medium because it brings it from a probably above your monitor's refresh rate which is great to
[3746.90 → 3755.94] not to definitely not yeah and even valve zone games with portal falling behind by like 30 percent are not
[3755.94 → 3763.46] running on par and the blame is probably in some cases probably the game developer but in many
[3763.46 → 3770.74] cases probably not and the blame probably falls mostly with the graphics card makers but the cold hard
[3770.74 → 3776.42] truth is hold on I'm going to see if I can find a source for this one of my favourite things okay this is a
[3776.42 → 3781.14] little bit unrelated but metro last light redux, and then they go to maximum settings, and it's like
[3781.14 → 3790.66] like doesn't run great on anything unfortunately because it's super hard to run 9.5 to 4.5 yeah
[3790.66 → 3795.62] unfortunately I can't find a source for it but so I'm not going to give the number, but someone was
[3795.62 → 3801.70] telling me that they had heard uh they'd heard AMD say something along the lines of uh that the the the
[3801.70 → 3808.74] the Linux driver download percentage was very very very like lower than you'd think very, very low the
[3808.74 → 3815.70] people who actually desire to run discrete graphics cards and Linux is very, very low and I was
[3815.70 → 3824.10] really excited um i I was actually like really, really excited by steam OS when I first heard about it
[3824.10 → 3833.86] two years ago oh yeah okay yeah yeah so i and valves like valves conviction um in their
[3834.82 → 3843.38] in their movement to bring gaming to a more open platform and I still admire valve's commitment
[3843.38 → 3848.90] um to bring their titles and to encourage other developers to bring their own titles to steam OS to
[3848.90 → 3856.74] run on Linux natively and what's what's cool is for most gamers remember most gamers are still running
[3856.74 → 3864.58] 1080p or lower okay so most gamers with decent hardware and remember they could afford a hundred
[3864.58 → 3870.50] extra dollars on a graphics card potentially if they don't buy windows, so there goes your performance
[3870.50 → 3876.66] tax right there you just buy better hardware potentially so most gamers running at 1080p um are
[3876.66 → 3884.58] not going to are not going to demand the kinds of experiences that for now things like VR or multi-monitor
[3884.58 → 3888.90] multi-monitor affinity gaming like some of those things that just don't work on Linux due to driver support
[3888.90 → 3894.02] right now they're not going to need them and there and there is potential for that movement to continue
[3894.02 → 3903.30] one thing about the driver download stat is I'm not super great at Linux I use it fairly often but I'm actually
[3903.30 → 3909.78] not super great at it um i I think it's hard to say that you're super great at Linux to be completely
[3909.78 → 3918.82] fair um non-official driver packs are very very very common yep and the included drivers are generally
[3918.82 → 3926.74] better yeah so like the AMD statistic might not be accurate because they're very probably using
[3926.74 → 3934.02] something else some I think mesa is a popular common one uh but I could super be wrong but i
[3934.02 → 3938.82] don't know but like you use other things to control your stuff that's one of the reasons why people like
[3938.82 → 3943.78] Linux but that ties in really well with the end of my point which is as much as I admire valve's effort
[3943.78 → 3950.10] and i I hope for success for Linux gaming in general I don't think steam OS is the answer because
[3950.10 → 3955.94] steam OS is an arrow with no bullseye to move towards like it doesn't know what it's targeting it
[3955.94 → 3962.42] thinks it's targeting mainstream gamers but like then it throws a controller at you that not only
[3962.42 → 3968.66] is different from any controller you've ever held but requires you to completely rebind everything in
[3968.66 → 3974.42] order to even play games a process that can be done and is no problem for a power user I was able to
[3974.42 → 3980.42] figure it out it was no big deal, and it's very versatile but Joe Xbox gamer I mean if it's more
[3980.42 → 3985.62] complicated than like oh cool a magnetic d-pad alternative it's not happening it's not
[3985.62 → 3991.22] happening so and to be completely honest sometimes I feel like being a power user and sometimes I'd be
[3991.22 → 3995.54] like yeah I want to configure this to be like exactly how I want to run for this exact game
[3995.54 → 4001.46] and sometimes yeah but if I'm gonna play like dirt showdown yeah exactly I do not want I want to plug
[4001.46 → 4006.66] in my controller and i never even want to open up the controller sub menu I want to click race race race
[4006.66 → 4013.38] quick race go yeah that's it yeah because I feel like vegging that's why I'm playing a game yeah sometimes
[4013.38 → 4018.50] yeah I'm going to want to tinker but I don't want to have to tinker and certain gaming experiences are
[4018.50 → 4024.42] worth the effort of tinkering quite frankly it's just that for me like a racing game or like a third
[4024.42 → 4029.14] a third person exploring game is that's when I'm just like chilling, and it's its all my brain can
[4029.14 → 4034.74] do to solve whatever Lara Croft's breast physics puzzle of the day is or whatever else um
[4034.74 → 4043.70] some of you have been asking about these shirts we're wearing so it's uh teespring.com when Christmas
[4043.70 → 4049.30] and you can get it in a variety of colours we actually went out of our way to choose ugly colours
[4049.86 → 4055.22] so um that's kind of the point it's kind of the point they're called ugly Christmas sweaters
[4055.22 → 4059.94] yep now to be clear they are not sweaters they're just t-shirt, or they're excuse me they're just sweatshirts
[4059.94 → 4063.94] yeah but uh they're ugly what's the difference between a sweater and a sweatshirt a sweater is
[4063.94 → 4065.22] woven oh
[4068.90 → 4077.70] I had no idea yeah that actually makes a ton of sense um Pokémon generation one coming into the 3ds
[4077.70 → 4081.14] there's an announcement video you guys can check that out if you're into that sort of thing and
[4081.14 → 4086.74] that's literally all there's to say on that topic we don't know uh there's been speculation as to
[4086.74 → 4091.22] whether I guess there is more to say on that topic yeah there's lots to say about it actually
[4091.22 → 4094.90] there's been speculation whether the old bugs will be in there because there
[4094.90 → 4100.50] was a lot of them and I don't mean like bug type Pokémon I mean like the mystic no and all
[4101.14 → 4108.98] that kind of stuff you like that um yeah I like that I don't know because i as far as my knowledge
[4108.98 → 4114.42] goes a lot of those have to do with how things were stored in memory so I don't know if that's going
[4114.42 → 4119.46] to translate properly because these are virtual console titles for the 3ds yeah but if you're
[4119.46 → 4129.14] emulating the game boy then you could potentially emulate I have never emulated red or blue have you
[4129.14 → 4133.86] have you tried any of the bugs I did not own a game boy or Game Boy Color I have definitely played
[4133.86 → 4140.42] through Pokémon blue I own two advances I don't own an advanced never did oh wow i I owned an original a
[4140.42 → 4147.38] colour and two advances I don't like I don't maybe the chat will know if you emulate it or the bug's
[4147.38 → 4156.02] still there okay Brandon knows apparently and when you do emulate it the bugs are still there so maybe
[4156.02 → 4165.30] it'll work good job Brandon thanks Brandon uh okay, okay mystic no definitely works apparently so hopefully
[4165.30 → 4170.18] they don't screw with anything, but they're fixing some stuff so you can wirelessly trade Pokémon now
[4170.90 → 4177.06] is that a fix well it's a new feature because you have to use the stupid link cable yeah, but that's
[4177.06 → 4181.62] just connecting that's connectivity of the device that's that's the feature upgrade in my mind I don't
[4181.62 → 4186.10] know if that translates to the game or if that's just connectivity to the device yeah well either way
[4186.10 → 4190.98] that's because it's its an improved experiment it's it improves the experience I still have a link
[4190.98 → 4198.34] cable of course you do so red blue and yellow are launching and uh there you go it is uh yeah
[4198.34 → 4202.90] February 27th 2016 release I'm not quite sure why it's taking so long but uh given that
[4204.50 → 4207.70] emulated Pokémon red blue and yellow have existed for a long time
[4208.90 → 4215.62] in the like a really long time performance yeah like going back to my uh my Napster days
[4215.62 → 4223.46] um yeah yeah I think we talked about that um you know what I is sort of is unrelated to this but
[4223.46 → 4229.70] i kind of wanted to touch on apparently they're doing a HD remake of twilight princess yeah are you
[4229.70 → 4237.94] for real that game how old is twilight princess like six years old I have to look it up twilight
[4237.94 → 4243.46] princess blah blah blah blah blah blah Wikipedia thank you that's the original Wii like it's not
[4243.46 → 4255.70] 2006 what I played twilight princess nine years ago whoa we both just got a ancient moment I think
[4258.02 → 4264.26] whoa I didn't even consider that like a collector game for me, I have it at home I didn't think
[4266.34 → 4273.38] huh we should move on so we don't feel so old again i was good oh wow crap on net link daily
[4273.38 → 4278.82] on the NCI channel I was like ripping into them about doing HD remakes of a game that would have
[4278.82 → 4285.46] been HD if the freaking console had had any decent hardware in it which is still true by the way
[4286.90 → 4295.06] that's so brutal but i really oh I didn't realize it wasn't that old oh my goodness um T-Mobile is
[4295.06 → 4302.90] apparently going to let you stream some video for free another bold move so they're calling it binge on
[4302.90 → 4310.26] man does he not look like some kind of serial rapist in every picture I was maybe not going to go that route
[4312.42 → 4318.18] but he's the serial rapist I love that's for sure oh wow okay whatever look at him
[4318.18 → 4328.90] he's doing some stuff look at that scary face uh um other stuff happened in the news uh VGA's look at him
[4328.90 → 4336.26] 970 fallout 4 editions which is probably a little late and stuff but the backplate's pretty cool
[4337.06 → 4343.06] um we should talk more about the T-Mobile thing actually it's not so YouTube unfortunately not
[4343.06 → 4349.70] included neither is twitched they did say they are working with YouTube but Netflix Hulu showtime vessel
[4350.34 → 4356.90] hey uh HBO go and sling TV are supported I went to the vessel offices last weekend oh yeah how was that
[4356.90 → 4366.98] some freaking cool people, and they have a cool modern office we don't have our office is functional we
[4367.78 → 4373.06] we have a cool office it doesn't feel very modern once you walk into the vessel offices
[4373.70 → 4381.78] their space is amazing yeah there's Silicon Valley though yeah yeah we feel very like where we are and
[4381.78 → 4389.86] they feel very like where they are it's like Linus media group pragmatism
[4392.18 → 4399.54] it's like we have cool stuff, but it's cool stuff with a purpose yeah pretty much across the board
[4401.14 → 4405.46] their stuff has a purpose I just mean like they have the flat floor with everybody on it
[4405.46 → 4412.34] yeah, yeah like the only rooms are meeting rooms and then like the the the entrance area is like
[4412.34 → 4417.38] large, and they have extensive places to put like bikes and stuff and there's a ping pong table and
[4417.38 → 4421.94] they have a large probably a couple of electric cars charging ports outside yeah they have a large
[4421.94 → 4426.50] kitchen which is stocked with like snack food and drinks if you need it there's a hey we have a large
[4426.50 → 4429.30] kitchen stocked with snack food I don't put the snack food in it
[4429.30 → 4436.74] yeah I don't know their office was cool they're actually super cool yeah I had a really cool talk
[4436.74 → 4442.34] with them um so sorry back to the T-Mobile thing I wasn't damn it I wasn't done with that so it is
[4442.34 → 4447.06] it is speculated that the reason that the uncapped video streaming is only offered on certain
[4447.06 → 4452.98] services is that it requires some back-end work to compress the data so that you know T-Mobile isn't
[4452.98 → 4458.50] going to be stuck with the bill for putting a bunch of 1080p freaking YouTube videos all over the place
[4459.30 → 4464.50] um so the idea is that it will be optimized for a small screen which makes a whole ton of sense
[4465.06 → 4469.78] um that's really cool that vessel supported I guess it kind of makes sense because it looks like
[4469.78 → 4476.58] Hulu is also supported and vessel is the former uh former founder I believe or CEO at least of Hulu
[4476.58 → 4484.58] yeah um which is kind of cool because like i just kind of chat with him sometimes, and he was in the
[4484.58 → 4489.06] meeting yeah it's like he's a super smart dude he's super down-to-earth guy super smart
[4489.06 → 4495.38] guy, and it's just like i kind of forget when I'm talking to him that he's probably a multi-trillionaire
[4495.94 → 4502.02] he's also like a big deal at Amazon at some point yeah and stuff one of those like serial startup
[4502.02 → 4509.22] people um it's hilarious a lot of people on our forum underestimate the number of people watching
[4509.22 → 4514.82] our videos on vessel and the impact that vessel has had on our business and underestimate vessel's
[4514.82 → 4521.62] chances at continued survival they are not stupid they are not new, and they are not going away so
[4521.62 → 4528.42] yeah there's a little tidbit for you um I guess that's pretty much if you need to do a shout-out
[4528.42 → 4542.42] for desertbus.org yeah okay where's the notes for that uh uh uh November 14th so tomorrow um desert bus
[4542.42 → 4549.54] for hope is a charity marathon for some of you today yeah actually in Europe, but this is PST time so
[4550.42 → 4555.62] no it is pacific daylight time or wait no it is pacific standard time damn it yes it's standard time
[4555.62 → 4561.22] right now right yeah okay I think so I don't yeah, yeah minus eight GMT right yeah okay
[4561.22 → 4565.54] um loading ready run is doing their desert bus for hope charity marathon which they've been doing for
[4565.54 → 4575.06] a long time when they play desert bus which is the worst most boring game careful yeah that's why i
[4575.06 → 4580.10] stopped maybe not the worst about buses driving through a desert it's its pretty rough because there's
[4580.10 → 4586.74] some pretty bad games up there yes um the bus i I don't remember if it all veers left or right
[4586.74 → 4592.34] but it slowly veers one direction so you have to just keep making it go straight but I think it auto
[4592.34 → 4598.42] goes for you and if you screw up you have to restart the whole thing, and it's just it's its ridiculous
[4598.42 → 4604.26] they're hilarious it's tons of fun to watch it's starting at 10 a.m PST saturday, November 14th their
[4604.26 → 4609.54] charity website is just desertbus.org it's on the screen check it out support cool people doing cool stuff
[4610.10 → 4618.02] okay um on the subject of cool people doing cool stuff I have done it not me I didn't do anything
[4618.02 → 4624.74] cool um but what I did do is I put together a list of the cool people and the cool things that they did
[4624.74 → 4630.42] and the after party today is going to be all about the honourable mentions and winners of ultra-wide
[4630.42 → 4637.54] festival, so thank you for tuning into the wan show today and that is the outro oh I didn't get to wave
[4639.54 → 4645.70] the other one
[4645.70 → 4649.30] yeah you had enough waving you good I was just going to go until you cut the stream
[4651.78 → 4666.10] damn it oh wait that's an overlay I thought you put it in the corner I was like I have to keep going
[4666.10 → 4667.30] watch bullion
[4672.34 → 4672.66] again
[4676.66 → 4677.38] let's see
[4677.38 → 4681.40] It
