[0.00 --> 7.48]  All right guys, welcome to the WAN show, the live show every week at approximately 4.30 Pacific time.
[8.04 --> 9.64]  I like cables like this.
[9.68 --> 13.08]  Can you really say approximately when it's always after?
[14.00 --> 16.04]  No, it has been before.
[16.92 --> 17.94]  When you're not here.
[18.56 --> 22.42]  When my brother and I host it, sometimes we start it like five minutes early just to troll.
[22.76 --> 26.36]  Wow, that is a different type of trolling.
[26.36 --> 30.42]  It's the kind of trolling we often have around here, trelping.
[32.10 --> 32.54]  Trelping?
[32.62 --> 33.58]  You've never heard of trelping?
[33.80 --> 34.16]  No, actually.
[34.16 --> 35.64]  Yeah, that's something that we do all the time.
[35.76 --> 36.76]  It's helpful trolling.
[37.74 --> 42.08]  Where you're like, here's the answer, but in the most obnoxious possible way.
[44.22 --> 47.38]  I hope it made you happy, jackass.
[47.72 --> 48.20]  Yeah, yeah.
[48.34 --> 50.58]  So guys, we've got a great show for you today.
[50.58 --> 58.32]  There's big updates with respect to net neutrality as well as the Title II reclassification of the interwebs.
[59.14 --> 59.66]  Yeah.
[60.02 --> 60.38]  Yeah.
[60.60 --> 61.94]  Basically all good news there.
[62.28 --> 66.80]  Android 5.0 Lollipop so far is a gigantic turd.
[67.10 --> 68.48]  I mean, we often point at...
[68.48 --> 69.62]  Well, okay, we'll talk about it later.
[69.70 --> 73.10]  Basically, the adoption of it is very, very low.
[74.14 --> 74.72]  Titty tiny.
[75.44 --> 76.20]  Very small.
[77.64 --> 79.84]  Can I have some more lollipops?
[79.84 --> 80.04]  Yes.
[81.82 --> 82.60]  Wasn't he small?
[82.72 --> 83.56]  Wasn't that part of the story?
[84.74 --> 85.54]  Oliver Twist?
[85.66 --> 85.78]  Yeah.
[85.78 --> 86.62]  No, he was just a kid.
[86.88 --> 87.94]  I thought he was a small kid.
[87.94 --> 88.54]  He was an orphan.
[88.96 --> 89.20]  Yeah.
[89.54 --> 93.12]  I mean, he was smaller than his parents, but you can't prove it because they weren't exactly around.
[94.56 --> 94.96]  Oh!
[97.30 --> 100.62]  I think I tasted some Cards Against Humanity there.
[101.20 --> 102.34]  I think I was coming back.
[102.36 --> 103.36]  Yeah, that's going to be fun.
[103.36 --> 106.84]  We've got a new format for Channel Super Fun coming up.
[107.02 --> 108.58]  We're calling it Games Night.
[108.58 --> 110.08]  We play games.
[110.30 --> 110.52]  Yep.
[110.62 --> 111.94]  The first one is Cards Against Humanity.
[112.06 --> 115.42]  So it will probably be the most inappropriate one of all of them.
[115.58 --> 117.20]  Out of anything we've ever released.
[117.40 --> 117.54]  Yeah.
[117.92 --> 119.08]  What else we got for topics today?
[119.40 --> 120.48]  We have...
[120.48 --> 121.16]  Am I starting?
[121.54 --> 122.74]  Well, I did the first two already.
[122.90 --> 123.64]  You already did them?
[123.72 --> 124.00]  Yeah.
[124.62 --> 127.30]  The lollipop thing and the net neutrality thing.
[127.36 --> 127.82]  I remember now.
[127.90 --> 130.86]  I derailed that so hard that I forgot where the rails were.
[130.86 --> 134.74]  By the time I got to my destination.
[135.08 --> 138.80]  Anyways, China's going to require real name registration to be able to use the internet.
[139.74 --> 140.46]  So...
[140.46 --> 140.84]  Buh.
[141.38 --> 142.96]  Also, Nintendo Creators Program.
[144.00 --> 144.44]  Buh.
[144.74 --> 145.76]  You got all the bad news.
[145.76 --> 146.24]  There's more revisions on that.
[146.38 --> 146.58]  Yeah.
[146.88 --> 149.28]  There's more Nintendo Creators Program revisions and they're bad.
[149.50 --> 150.00]  So...
[150.00 --> 151.96]  I got the good news and the amusing news.
[152.06 --> 153.42]  You just got the terrible, horrible...
[153.42 --> 154.40]  Things that suck.
[154.76 --> 155.54]  ...crappy news.
[155.66 --> 156.10]  All right.
[156.10 --> 157.20]  Things that suck with Linus and Luke.
[157.26 --> 158.12]  Let's roll that intro.
[165.02 --> 166.48]  Note, you didn't clench hard enough.
[166.74 --> 166.92]  Oh.
[167.20 --> 168.42]  I'm ready to do this, though.
[168.86 --> 169.34]  Oh, cool.
[173.86 --> 174.26]  Usually.
[174.26 --> 174.42]  Usually.
[176.56 --> 177.96]  And I think it's funny.
[180.22 --> 183.46]  Our sponsors today are lynda.com.
[183.66 --> 185.88]  Sex, appeal, and learning.
[186.10 --> 187.18]  All at the same time.
[187.20 --> 188.36]  Have they messaged you about that?
[188.60 --> 188.96]  No.
[189.14 --> 189.34]  No.
[189.40 --> 191.22]  They keep letting me do this.
[191.46 --> 191.82]  All right.
[192.06 --> 192.92]  And Squarespace.
[193.28 --> 194.14]  They have a new slogan.
[194.36 --> 198.12]  I don't remember what it is, but it's something to do with making beautiful websites.
[198.52 --> 198.84]  Squarespace.
[200.00 --> 201.62]  Help you dream with...
[201.62 --> 202.22]  What's his name?
[202.76 --> 203.40]  Jeff Bridges.
[203.48 --> 204.04]  Jeff Bridges.
[204.14 --> 205.26]  I don't think that's it.
[205.68 --> 207.06]  Also, mass drop.
[207.20 --> 208.64]  Get good deals on stuff.
[208.64 --> 209.64]  And it's...
[209.64 --> 211.44]  Physics.
[211.88 --> 212.68]  Because mass.
[213.00 --> 214.00]  And dropping things.
[214.36 --> 215.44]  Which is also physics.
[215.44 --> 216.86]  Everything is basically physics.
[216.86 --> 218.88]  Except they would fall at the same rate.
[219.96 --> 220.26]  Right.
[220.64 --> 221.28]  Which is physics.
[221.28 --> 223.38]  And not all mass drops fall at the same rate.
[223.44 --> 224.10]  Well, hold on a second.
[224.20 --> 226.20]  They won't necessarily fall at the same rate.
[226.32 --> 227.28]  In a vacuum, they would.
[227.94 --> 229.80]  So, you know, if I were to drop...
[229.80 --> 231.60]  But mass isn't what's determining that.
[231.96 --> 232.48]  That's right.
[232.56 --> 233.10]  That's true.
[233.26 --> 234.42]  So mass...
[234.42 --> 236.42]  The mass is not important.
[236.50 --> 237.44]  Well, but on their website...
[237.44 --> 238.44]  It's still kind of important.
[238.44 --> 240.44]  More mass does make it drop further.
[240.62 --> 243.02]  It would drop further if it had more mass.
[243.96 --> 245.80]  So they're defying the laws of physics.
[246.30 --> 246.70]  No.
[246.90 --> 249.06]  By not being in a physics-equatable situation.
[249.06 --> 249.32]  No.
[249.40 --> 250.92]  No, they're not defying anything.
[251.26 --> 253.96]  Actually, if you were to drop something...
[253.96 --> 254.20]  Yeah.
[254.44 --> 257.54]  They're not saying that it will fall at a greater rate.
[257.96 --> 260.04]  They're saying that it will fall further.
[260.04 --> 261.36]  Because the price is lower.
[261.36 --> 264.50]  So once it hits, whatever obstacle it hits...
[264.50 --> 264.52]  Okay.
[265.04 --> 266.38]  It actually craters further.
[266.38 --> 269.22]  So the obstacle is actually where the recording starts.
[269.36 --> 269.58]  Yes.
[269.68 --> 270.70]  So that's zero.
[271.16 --> 276.26]  Or even if it wasn't, it would still be lower than the starting point.
[276.32 --> 276.54]  Yeah.
[276.92 --> 277.24]  Okay.
[277.58 --> 277.80]  Yeah.
[278.00 --> 278.18]  Yeah.
[278.34 --> 278.54]  Right?
[278.66 --> 278.80]  Yeah.
[278.94 --> 279.04]  Yeah.
[279.14 --> 279.66]  Because there's...
[279.66 --> 280.96]  Oh, that works because...
[280.96 --> 282.14]  There's a discount no matter what.
[282.14 --> 284.78]  The first resistance point could be the first discount.
[284.82 --> 285.30]  That's right.
[285.30 --> 286.82]  So where the drop is is zero.
[287.22 --> 287.86]  First discount.
[288.00 --> 290.92]  And then there could even be a higher resistance point where further discounts are.
[290.92 --> 291.76]  Exactly.
[292.24 --> 292.58]  Wow.
[293.48 --> 294.00]  Okay.
[294.32 --> 297.18]  So let's go ahead and...
[297.18 --> 297.36]  Oh.
[297.86 --> 298.54]  Hey, we've got...
[298.54 --> 298.68]  Okay.
[298.84 --> 304.20]  Let's go into our first topic right early on here.
[304.32 --> 307.60]  And we're going to try and get this out of the way extremely quickly.
[307.74 --> 309.10]  We're bringing in...
[309.10 --> 310.04]  I don't know.
[310.20 --> 312.56]  People are asking Linda to teach us physics.
[318.00 --> 319.20]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[319.20 --> 324.26]  If there was anything that could teach us physics, it would be Linda.com.
[326.26 --> 332.46]  But Linda.com's powers are only so magnificent.
[333.38 --> 335.32]  And there is a limit.
[335.40 --> 337.34]  There is a limit to what Linda.com can do.
[337.80 --> 340.42]  Teaching us physics, I think, falls outside of that limit.
[340.42 --> 341.42]  Oh, yes.
[341.42 --> 341.50]  Okay.
[341.60 --> 347.64]  So we are calling in a special guest, Mr. Ryan Shrout, to come in and give us the once
[347.64 --> 349.18]  and for all answer.
[349.18 --> 349.40]  Whoa.
[349.48 --> 350.64]  He's on his set and everything.
[350.68 --> 351.70]  He's on his set.
[351.88 --> 355.86]  Usually he's shirtless and I have to crop around his head.
[355.98 --> 356.54]  Hold on, Ryan.
[356.58 --> 357.20]  Don't talk yet.
[357.28 --> 359.92]  I have to turn you down in the volume thing.
[362.12 --> 362.52]  Mixer.
[362.60 --> 363.12]  That's the word.
[363.44 --> 363.88]  Thank you.
[363.88 --> 368.14]  Boopity boop.
[368.26 --> 368.58]  All right.
[368.66 --> 369.84]  Then I have to add you.
[372.20 --> 374.00]  Add Ryan Shrout.
[374.80 --> 376.40]  Everyone's saying Linus spec tips.
[376.84 --> 377.82]  Linus spec tips.
[377.94 --> 378.38]  Oh, yes.
[378.42 --> 379.76]  I am wearing glasses today.
[380.60 --> 381.30]  Isn't that fun?
[381.62 --> 382.02]  All right.
[382.10 --> 383.88]  So welcome to the show, Mr. Shrout.
[383.94 --> 387.84]  We are going to put to rest the whole NVIDIA thing once and for all.
[387.84 --> 394.48]  And we're going to kick this right off with, okay, this is what our viewers said to us
[394.48 --> 395.22]  last week.
[395.40 --> 401.34]  Are you telling me, you know, looking in the eye, making eye contact, are you telling me
[401.34 --> 404.52]  that no one at NVIDIA caught this?
[404.78 --> 410.40]  No engineer ever looked at the spec page once it was released and caught it and mentioned
[410.40 --> 410.78]  this.
[410.84 --> 412.64]  They're saying that's completely unbelievable.
[412.84 --> 416.30]  I'd like to hear sort of the flip side of that argument.
[416.30 --> 427.18]  I would believe that it was not caught until fairly recently only because the, now we're
[427.18 --> 434.48]  talking about the ROP and cache size changes only, not the memory pool differences.
[435.00 --> 439.76]  But if you look at that, like those specific points, those specifications are not really
[439.76 --> 441.40]  listed on GeForce.com.
[441.50 --> 443.40]  They're not really listed on NVIDIA's website.
[443.40 --> 448.94]  As far as I know, the only place those were actually kind of published is in the reviewer's
[448.94 --> 454.84]  guide that they sent to editors after the, you know, the launch day and before, you know,
[454.86 --> 456.90]  when we got all of our test cards and stuff.
[457.08 --> 457.18]  Sure.
[457.18 --> 462.90]  And so then it took us reading those documents and publishing the incorrect information in
[462.90 --> 465.32]  your review and my review and everybody else's review out there.
[466.98 --> 474.10]  And I would find it, I would find it probably difficult to believe that zero people inside
[474.10 --> 477.62]  a company that size took note of that.
[477.72 --> 478.92]  Like nobody said, oh, you know what?
[478.92 --> 483.22]  It actually doesn't have two megs of L2 cache on there.
[483.88 --> 488.46]  But I don't know if that person thought it was, well, it's not that big of a deal at
[488.46 --> 488.82]  this point.
[488.88 --> 493.20]  The information's out there and performance is what it is and we'll just go about our
[493.20 --> 493.74]  business there.
[493.86 --> 499.78]  I, I, I don't think, um, you know, I don't think there was like big meetings between PR
[499.78 --> 502.36]  and engineering and said, oh no, we have this discrepancy.
[502.36 --> 504.82]  And should, what do we do?
[504.86 --> 506.82]  Do we want to hide it and bury it or do we want to bring it up?
[506.84 --> 508.06]  And they decided to bury it.
[508.08 --> 513.88]  I think it was more likely a, the right people didn't notice, uh, and didn't, didn't just
[513.88 --> 516.68]  decided not to bring it up to the people that would actually care.
[516.76 --> 521.20]  If this had been something that they had caught a week or two weeks into the nine 80 or nine
[521.20 --> 525.52]  70 release, I think they would have come forward with that part about it.
[525.56 --> 525.94]  I think.
[526.40 --> 527.34]  So, okay.
[527.46 --> 531.82]  So let me, let me, so I'll, I'll go and I'll play my audience's devil's advocacy.
[531.82 --> 536.32]  Once more and say, okay, if you were, this was actually, this was actually a really good
[536.32 --> 536.58]  point.
[536.66 --> 539.80]  Someone, I feel bad because I forget their name, but there was a really good point that
[539.80 --> 540.66]  someone brought up.
[540.66 --> 548.18]  And that was, if you're an engineer who slaved away on this GPU for literally years on launch
[548.18 --> 554.94]  day, are you not sitting at your computer reading the reviews that people are making about this
[554.94 --> 556.86]  product that you spent so much of your time on?
[556.92 --> 558.20]  Like, are you not even interested?
[558.20 --> 564.50]  Do you, does every single one of them skip over the spec sheet because they know the
[564.50 --> 564.74]  spec?
[566.00 --> 571.34]  Um, I would guess, I think, I think, I think it's a, it's a very valid point there.
[571.46 --> 579.06]  I would guess that, um, many of the, of the engineers and, and marketing and, and technical
[579.06 --> 584.42]  people at NVIDIA or AMB or Intel do what a lot of our readers do, which is they kind of
[584.42 --> 588.94]  read that intro and then they kind of go to the end there and kind of get what did, what
[588.94 --> 590.48]  is this person's actual opinion on it?
[590.48 --> 596.06]  I don't think they would really dive too much into, um, a description, like my description
[596.06 --> 599.70]  of the architecture that they built because they know it better than I do.
[600.02 --> 600.12]  Right.
[601.32 --> 602.64]  Maybe some of them did.
[602.76 --> 603.66]  I, you know, I don't know.
[603.66 --> 608.28]  Uh, and if, if they would have found that discrepancy, would they have brought it up
[608.28 --> 609.16]  to somebody?
[609.32 --> 609.76]  Probably.
[610.62 --> 616.18]  Uh, it's, it's a, it's a tough, it's a tough spot in videos in trying to convince people
[616.18 --> 618.06]  that that's, that that wouldn't have happened.
[618.14 --> 624.96]  I think the memory thing is much more impactful to the consumer than the, the cash and ROP concern
[624.96 --> 625.52]  necessarily.
[625.52 --> 628.64]  Um, but let's get into that then.
[628.82 --> 628.92]  Okay.
[628.96 --> 629.58]  So, okay.
[629.72 --> 635.88]  So plaus, plausibly, even an engineer who worked on the GPU might've missed that part of any
[635.88 --> 637.88]  review because why would they give a crap?
[638.04 --> 640.80]  They don't need you to tell them how many shaders it has.
[641.30 --> 647.74]  Um, but let's get into the memory speed bit because it's not the first time they've done
[647.74 --> 652.20]  it and it's not the first time that they haven't really talked about it.
[652.20 --> 655.58]  So is the amount of butthurt out there justified?
[656.04 --> 657.58]  Should there be a class action lawsuit?
[658.48 --> 665.64]  Um, I don't, if we get into the politics side of it is I tend to be on the, uh, persuasion
[665.64 --> 671.96]  of class action lawsuits are rarely necessary, but I would say in this instance, it's, it's
[671.96 --> 675.90]  similar to what the, I know you're referring to what they did with the 550 TI and the 660
[675.90 --> 678.80]  TI and how that memory configuration worked compared to the 970.
[678.80 --> 682.60]  And it's similar in a couple of ways and it's, and it's different in several ways as well.
[682.68 --> 690.20]  Like the, the, the bandwidth discrepancy between the second pool of memory on the 660 TI and
[690.20 --> 694.86]  the primary pool was not nearly the gulf that we have with the 970.
[694.96 --> 700.90]  It didn't go from, you know, 184 gigs to 24 gigs per second or whatever it is.
[701.34 --> 701.42]  Yeah.
[701.42 --> 706.22]  Um, and also it was a significantly higher percentage of the total frame buffer, right?
[706.28 --> 710.74]  So I think you were talking about a, a two gig frame buffer at that time of which 500
[710.74 --> 713.18]  megs was this kind of secondary pool.
[713.26 --> 716.68]  So you're talking about 25% of the memory instead of one eighth of your memory.
[716.68 --> 723.62]  Um, so it's, it's, so it's important there, but I would, the internet tends to, as you guys
[723.62 --> 729.00]  are well aware, make things a little bit more, um, aggressive than they need to be.
[729.08 --> 735.98]  Maybe, uh, it, they tend to amplify these problems more than they would be otherwise as you know,
[735.98 --> 740.44]  the kind of the snowball begins to roll and petitions are formed and whatnot.
[740.58 --> 741.48]  Change.org.
[741.84 --> 742.20]  Yeah.
[742.36 --> 747.92]  Which was probably the most poorly worded, uh, petition to actually get something done
[747.92 --> 748.54]  I've ever read.
[749.62 --> 749.94]  But.
[750.34 --> 750.98]  You know, it's funny.
[751.06 --> 751.76]  I haven't read it.
[751.86 --> 753.92]  I just assumed that there was a change.org petition.
[754.34 --> 755.58]  Oh no, there absolutely is.
[755.64 --> 756.70]  Oh, there absolutely is.
[756.76 --> 757.66]  And it was, it was written.
[757.98 --> 759.98]  It was maybe by no fault of his own.
[760.04 --> 761.68]  It was written by a non-native English speaker.
[761.68 --> 765.12]  So it's kind of like all in it broken up and it's like, I don't really know what they're
[765.12 --> 767.00]  trying to tell me, but I know what their intent is.
[767.46 --> 770.90]  Uh, I, I think it's a, I think it's something that's worth noting.
[770.90 --> 776.30]  And I think Nvidia should have, if, if I don't believe that they should have called it a
[776.30 --> 783.02]  3.5 gig card, but I think they should have been upfront with the technical media to say,
[783.16 --> 788.40]  Hey, some of this is a little bit different, you know, and we, we both know Nvidia very well.
[788.40 --> 793.80]  They come up, they could have made this a marketing, uh, positive as opposed to 3.5
[793.80 --> 796.22]  inch card with overflow.
[797.00 --> 797.36]  Yeah.
[798.08 --> 798.24]  Yeah.
[798.24 --> 798.40]  Yeah.
[798.40 --> 799.90]  500 gig of backup memory.
[800.14 --> 800.28]  Yeah.
[800.28 --> 803.86]  500 megs of super cash 2.0 or whatever crap they would have come up with.
[803.86 --> 804.08]  Right.
[804.40 --> 807.50]  And they could have done that and they would have sold it as an advantage.
[807.50 --> 812.90]  But now you come back and look at it in retrospect and you, you can only really see it in a negative
[812.90 --> 813.10]  light.
[813.16 --> 814.50]  There's no positive to it.
[814.92 --> 820.90]  Um, the only positive would be that, you know, this is, this is something that the 500 megs
[820.90 --> 824.18]  of, you know, super cash, whatever you want to call it, is actually only possible because
[824.18 --> 825.70]  of the way Maxwell was built.
[825.70 --> 830.36]  If you look back at, uh, kind of that block diagram that I think you guys showed last week
[830.36 --> 835.26]  as well, that, that the white diagram that, that shows the different blocks, um, it had
[835.26 --> 838.78]  they wanted to do that before they would have had to disable the entire block.
[838.86 --> 843.42]  You would have had 192 bit memory bus and you would have had three gigs of graphics memory.
[843.78 --> 849.96]  But because of the way, uh, Maxwell was architected to be more modular, they were able to disable
[849.96 --> 854.10]  just that portion of L2 and ROM to kind of help their yields and increase their, their
[854.10 --> 855.98]  profitability on the production side.
[856.26 --> 862.90]  And thus you were able to get 500 megs more, uh, of your primary frame buffer than you would
[862.90 --> 864.14]  have been able to get to before.
[864.14 --> 870.20]  And you kind of have this 500 megs that you can access as this secondary portion, I guess.
[870.82 --> 877.02]  But, uh, that being said, it is painfully obvious after everything has gone on over the
[877.02 --> 879.68]  last 10 days that this was, this was not the right way to do it.
[879.96 --> 884.08]  Um, and they are like, somebody sent me a link last week.
[884.10 --> 890.60]  To some, uh, law firm that is investigating the, the plans of a class action.
[890.60 --> 893.42]  And they, of course, just to make you feel better.
[893.62 --> 894.88]  Class actions only really benefit law firms anyways.
[895.12 --> 895.30]  Yeah.
[895.34 --> 896.54]  As far as I can tell, I mean.
[896.94 --> 901.52]  But they mentioned me as in their description, they kind of mentioned as quoted by PC Perspective,
[901.58 --> 902.06]  blah, blah, blah.
[902.14 --> 903.94]  I'm like, I don't want to be involved in this.
[904.84 --> 907.56]  I don't need to, I don't need any more depositions in my life.
[907.62 --> 907.94]  I'm good.
[907.94 --> 908.34]  Yeah.
[909.14 --> 913.54]  The funny thing about class actions is there was what, that Intel benchmark one that got
[913.54 --> 918.38]  resolved a little while ago where everyone got like $17 or something like that.
[918.54 --> 920.10]  So the only, the only, and it was.
[920.28 --> 923.22]  And you have to go through a filing thing for it and all this kind of stuff.
[923.38 --> 923.54]  Like.
[923.80 --> 925.30]  So the only one who benefited.
[925.80 --> 926.20]  Lawyers.
[926.20 --> 926.60]  Yeah.
[927.04 --> 929.26]  Because most people aren't going to claim it and they're just going to grab all the
[929.26 --> 929.84]  cash anyways.
[930.20 --> 935.46]  $17 is actually a lot for one of those if you're like a secondary plaintiff in that.
[935.62 --> 940.76]  I've had ones from like back in the DDR memory days that are like $3 and $6.
[941.44 --> 941.84]  Nice.
[942.10 --> 947.40]  It's like, I can't imagine the amount of processing and kind of records keeping you have to have
[947.40 --> 952.00]  for that many people to be sent $3 checks that I then have to go through the process of
[952.00 --> 957.20]  cashing or depositing and it's, you know, yes, the lawyers end up on the high side of
[957.20 --> 957.40]  that.
[957.60 --> 962.44]  The intent obviously to take the lawyer side is to kind of inhibit other companies or this
[962.44 --> 964.84]  company from doing that same thing again.
[964.84 --> 965.16]  Sure.
[965.54 --> 965.74]  Right.
[965.76 --> 967.24]  It's more of a punitive side.
[967.58 --> 967.74]  Yeah.
[968.04 --> 969.26]  It just doesn't really benefit.
[969.56 --> 972.20]  It doesn't end up benefiting the consumers other than.
[972.20 --> 976.38]  Unless that injury placed on the company benefits them in the future, but they're not getting
[976.38 --> 978.64]  benefited for purchasing that item.
[978.78 --> 978.92]  Yeah.
[979.16 --> 979.40]  Yeah.
[979.40 --> 983.72]  I don't think you're going to have a lawsuit that credits everybody that buys a 970 with
[983.72 --> 990.18]  one eighth of the price of the card or, you know, or upgrade everybody to a 980 or whatever.
[990.26 --> 990.42]  Yeah.
[990.54 --> 991.80]  I've seen people asking for that.
[991.90 --> 994.00]  How do you calculate worth as well?
[994.14 --> 996.44]  Because memory isn't 100% of the card.
[996.54 --> 998.04]  So one eighth isn't actually a proper.
[998.30 --> 998.46]  Yep.
[998.72 --> 998.88]  Yeah.
[998.88 --> 999.18]  Yeah.
[999.52 --> 999.80]  Okay.
[999.94 --> 1002.26]  So then the other thing that I wanted to bring you on.
[1002.34 --> 1005.68]  Oh, for those of you who don't know, this is Ryan Trout from PC Perspective.
[1005.76 --> 1007.46]  I realized I never really introduced him.
[1007.46 --> 1011.44]  We just kind of brought him on and started talking about the 970 VRAM gate issue.
[1012.38 --> 1014.26]  So welcome to the show, Ryan.
[1015.16 --> 1015.52]  Thanks.
[1015.86 --> 1017.30]  It's glad to finally be on here.
[1017.50 --> 1018.32]  You know, thanks.
[1018.66 --> 1020.60]  We were recording all that previous stuff, right?
[1020.62 --> 1021.44]  Because it was pretty good.
[1022.04 --> 1025.06]  So jumping forward to the other thing.
[1025.10 --> 1026.62]  I've got my NVIDIA sweater on, by the way.
[1026.68 --> 1027.22]  I don't know if you noticed.
[1027.22 --> 1027.72]  It's all natural.
[1027.96 --> 1028.32]  I did.
[1028.42 --> 1028.66]  I did.
[1028.66 --> 1028.86]  Yeah.
[1029.46 --> 1034.30]  I'm just messing with everybody because I'm going to go and play devil's advocate against
[1034.30 --> 1037.16]  NVIDIA while wearing my NVIDIA sweater.
[1037.38 --> 1040.00]  That's like my objective on the stream today.
[1040.52 --> 1041.94]  I'm just kind of having fun with it.
[1041.98 --> 1048.22]  I got a really fun email from someone about how I'm an NVIDIA apologist and there was some
[1048.22 --> 1049.54]  terrible punctuation in the email.
[1049.86 --> 1050.70]  It was pretty funny.
[1050.70 --> 1055.04]  Apologist and unapologetic are so overused now.
[1055.24 --> 1055.54]  Oh, yeah.
[1055.56 --> 1056.68]  Oh, my God.
[1056.84 --> 1057.72]  I'm an NVIDIA misogynist.
[1057.72 --> 1059.64]  We're unapologetically in behind this.
[1059.74 --> 1059.94]  Will it?
[1059.98 --> 1060.48]  Shut up.
[1061.62 --> 1066.20]  We got more than my fair share of those comments as well if you look through those couple of
[1066.20 --> 1067.14]  stories from last week.
[1067.36 --> 1068.08]  I did do that.
[1068.40 --> 1070.32]  So let's move on to the G-Sync one.
[1070.44 --> 1072.64]  G-Sync without a G-Sync module.
[1072.64 --> 1075.78]  Do you realistically think now that...
[1075.78 --> 1076.04]  Okay.
[1076.56 --> 1078.68]  Here's the million dollar question.
[1078.68 --> 1086.02]  Are we heading towards a future where a monitor has the hardware in the same way that a motherboard
[1086.02 --> 1088.08]  has a PCI Express slot?
[1088.34 --> 1095.06]  So where the monitor has the hardware to realistically operate perfectly with FreeSync or G-Sync and
[1095.06 --> 1100.54]  it's just going to come down to the monitor manufacturer to certify or not certify with a given maker.
[1100.70 --> 1101.36]  Is that where we're headed?
[1102.16 --> 1103.24]  I think that's where we're headed.
[1103.52 --> 1103.82]  Yes.
[1103.82 --> 1110.46]  I think the real issue here is when is that going to occur, right?
[1110.88 --> 1115.78]  So the kind of controversy around the G-Sync thing was that, well, at first the guy claimed
[1115.78 --> 1119.50]  that he hacked a driver to make it work when that wasn't really the case.
[1119.62 --> 1123.50]  But the insinuation was that, oh, look, G-Sync modules are never really required.
[1123.60 --> 1125.02]  You could always just do this.
[1125.56 --> 1127.20]  That's 100% not the case.
[1127.20 --> 1133.58]  Like if you look at desktop displays that existed today and that have existed for the
[1133.58 --> 1138.06]  past year that G-Sync has been around, you could not do that with currently shipping scalers
[1138.06 --> 1140.76]  and currently shipping, you know, display connection standards.
[1140.76 --> 1147.34]  But remember when AMD, you know, like I think it was October, November of 2013 when we were
[1147.34 --> 1152.98]  out in Montreal and NVIDIA demo G-Sync for the first time, that next January at CES, AMD
[1152.98 --> 1155.46]  had a laptop and they said, oh, look, we can do it too.
[1155.54 --> 1157.98]  And they showed a demo of a variable refresh screen.
[1158.42 --> 1160.56]  Not to me because I'm not one of the cool kids, but whatever.
[1161.88 --> 1164.02]  Hey, you know, you take that up with them.
[1164.20 --> 1165.94]  I try not to take the blame for that one.
[1167.40 --> 1170.34]  But they did it on a mobile form factor for a reason, right?
[1170.34 --> 1175.40]  It was in a mobile form factor, you have EDP, embedded display port.
[1175.64 --> 1180.56]  You have complete control and knowledge over all of the timing controllers and the display
[1180.56 --> 1182.52]  controllers between your GPU and the panel.
[1182.64 --> 1187.46]  You know everything in the pipeline, which you do not know on a desktop configuration.
[1187.92 --> 1191.12]  So desktop monitors are getting there.
[1191.90 --> 1196.02]  And that's why that's this is essentially what AMD's FreeSync is kind of has been waiting
[1196.02 --> 1196.50]  for, right?
[1196.50 --> 1198.18]  There's a reason why FreeSync is not out.
[1198.18 --> 1200.50]  And it's not really because AMD is holding back on anything.
[1200.80 --> 1205.38]  They need the technology to be out there and they need stuff to actually work and function.
[1206.10 --> 1212.16]  And what the mobile G-Sync kind of story showed us was that NVIDIA knows this.
[1212.64 --> 1217.26]  And they also know that in the mobile form factor, the mobile displays, you still, you know
[1217.26 --> 1218.08]  all that information.
[1218.08 --> 1225.74]  And they will go through a G-Sync module list certification process for mobile variants
[1225.74 --> 1227.70]  of G-Sync at the very least.
[1228.04 --> 1229.72]  But on the desktop side, it's still up in the air.
[1230.46 --> 1230.58]  Right.
[1231.52 --> 1231.96]  Right.
[1232.54 --> 1236.92]  I mean, I mean, there's there's you got to assume NVIDIA is working on there.
[1237.06 --> 1237.44]  Like I.
[1238.24 --> 1239.40]  OK, last question.
[1239.48 --> 1242.04]  Last question about this, because I know your wife wants you home at some point.
[1242.04 --> 1246.16]  So do you think what do you think NVIDIA's plan was?
[1246.28 --> 1253.32]  Were they looking to kickstart an entry into the display scaler business with a killer app
[1253.32 --> 1254.62]  feature like G-Sync?
[1254.84 --> 1255.84]  Was that the objective?
[1256.04 --> 1257.26]  Like was the was the idea?
[1257.44 --> 1262.56]  OK, we've got this totally non-cost effective solution, but we're going to ramp up the business
[1262.56 --> 1262.96]  volume.
[1262.96 --> 1265.92]  We are going to rev to it, rev three at rev four.
[1266.00 --> 1269.30]  We're going to get into the display scaler business and we're going to make that work
[1269.30 --> 1278.34]  seamlessly with our GPUs or flip side was the objective to actually have an exclusive
[1278.34 --> 1278.90]  feature.
[1279.22 --> 1283.88]  And they just didn't think that AMD and the scaler manufacturers would get their crap together
[1283.88 --> 1285.10]  so quickly.
[1286.78 --> 1292.54]  I don't think they necessarily wanted to enter into the scaler market specifically.
[1292.54 --> 1296.46]  I don't think that's that's like a super profitable business that they were trying to
[1296.46 --> 1297.80]  work their way into.
[1297.80 --> 1301.72]  What I what I really think occurred is.
[1302.98 --> 1308.48]  If you and I have quite a bit of background on this, it's like if you they knew panel self
[1308.48 --> 1312.78]  refresh was a thing right on mobile and on cell phones, on laptops and cell phones, they
[1312.78 --> 1317.70]  knew what it was and they figured out that, hey, we could use that for the alternate purposes
[1317.70 --> 1321.04]  rather than saving power to improve a gaming experience.
[1321.04 --> 1325.50]  And in order to do that, they wanted to be first to the market with it.
[1325.50 --> 1330.82]  They didn't want to have to, you know, to submit a standard to Visa and wait for it to be approved.
[1330.92 --> 1334.94]  And thus, you know, AMD and Intel and NVIDIA all be on the same pathway.
[1334.94 --> 1335.42]  Right.
[1335.48 --> 1337.14]  You know, nobody would have any particular advantage.
[1337.14 --> 1341.96]  So they went through with developing the logic for it, working with partners to make the displays
[1341.96 --> 1348.52]  and kind of integrating it first because they wanted to be the the one kind of pushing the variable refresh technology forward,
[1348.66 --> 1355.10]  which they clearly had done as much as AMD deserves credit with mantle for pushing the development of DirectX 12.
[1355.56 --> 1361.38]  NVIDIA deserves credit with G-Sync for pushing ahead adaptive sync and DP 1.2A plus and all that.
[1361.48 --> 1361.62]  Right.
[1361.62 --> 1370.08]  And what I think will be the most interesting thing to see is as we move into later this year
[1370.08 --> 1374.80]  and FreeSync monitors are widely available and they are shown to work mostly reliably
[1374.80 --> 1378.38]  and pretty closely match the experience that we have with G-Sync displays,
[1379.34 --> 1384.64]  will NVIDIA continue to require a G-Sync module in their desktop displays?
[1384.84 --> 1390.58]  And I think they will, but not for the same reasons that they have them in there today.
[1390.58 --> 1398.94]  I think that NVIDIA has more plans for display technology changes than just variable refresh.
[1399.22 --> 1403.04]  And in order to do that, they need to have a piece of logic on the other side.
[1403.52 --> 1406.24]  It doesn't mean G-Sync monitor shipping today will have those features,
[1406.66 --> 1410.56]  but that, you know, G-Sync 2.0, whatever that happens to be,
[1411.44 --> 1416.02]  maybe they introduce some more interesting things other than just a variable refresh.
[1416.02 --> 1421.06]  Or maybe they just straight up segment the desktop and the mobile GPUs that way.
[1421.14 --> 1426.50]  They just say, well, look, 980 supports whatever this new feature is with a G-Sync display,
[1426.66 --> 1428.76]  and 980M doesn't have it.
[1429.10 --> 1430.58]  I mean, they do that kind of thing all the time.
[1430.72 --> 1433.00]  Even stuff like ShadowPlay.
[1433.44 --> 1434.88]  It's like, oh, it's desktop first.
[1435.54 --> 1435.66]  Yeah.
[1435.68 --> 1437.86]  Or whatever else the case may be, and they might just not roll it out.
[1437.86 --> 1443.66]  I mean, even in its current form, for what we saw in this kind of alpha leak of mobile G-Sync,
[1444.34 --> 1447.14]  it is not at feature parity with G-Sync on the desktop.
[1447.66 --> 1447.88]  Right.
[1448.20 --> 1454.44]  Once you dip below that 25 or so frames per second mark, there, you know, on the desktop G-Sync,
[1454.58 --> 1458.94]  there's an algorithm in that chip that does work in terms of figuring out,
[1459.18 --> 1459.90]  has it been too long?
[1459.96 --> 1460.64]  Do I need to refresh?
[1460.64 --> 1464.44]  And it doubles up frame rates at certain points, and it keeps the experience better.
[1464.58 --> 1468.00]  When you go under that with the mobile version, it won't have that capability
[1468.00 --> 1470.24]  because the T-Cons don't have that kind of logic.
[1470.58 --> 1471.84]  They don't have the same size buffer.
[1472.92 --> 1477.10]  And so it's doubtful that they will ever have feature parity between the two.
[1477.68 --> 1480.64]  I don't know if they'll brand it differently, like G-Sync mobile,
[1480.76 --> 1484.58]  as we kind of have branded it for them, or G-Sync Lite, or whatever it is.
[1485.50 --> 1490.52]  They're usually better at it than SLI Lite or G-Sync Lite.
[1491.38 --> 1493.78]  But if you do Lite, then it's fine, right?
[1494.24 --> 1496.20]  Dynamic Super G-Sync.
[1496.26 --> 1498.80]  Maybe they'll do LI instead of TI.
[1499.16 --> 1499.36]  Yeah.
[1500.40 --> 1503.00]  They have a tremendous marketing department.
[1503.14 --> 1505.06]  I'm sure they're better than us at coming up with this crap.
[1506.40 --> 1507.04]  All right.
[1507.12 --> 1509.36]  Well, I think that was pretty much it.
[1509.48 --> 1513.00]  I can take off my NVIDIA hoodie now, thankfully, because I'm so fucking warm.
[1513.18 --> 1516.24]  Was the Razer armband supposed to look like an NVIDIA thing?
[1516.24 --> 1516.90]  No, no.
[1516.94 --> 1519.34]  I'm just wearing that because I have an armband.
[1519.34 --> 1522.48]  And I've been doing this weird thing with my wrist lately.
[1522.60 --> 1524.60]  It's been really cold when I sit and use the mouse.
[1524.68 --> 1526.92]  So I've been wearing that thing just for warmth.
[1527.36 --> 1528.42]  It seems to make it a little more comfortable.
[1528.52 --> 1531.54]  If that's happening, you are on the edge of carpal tunnel.
[1532.72 --> 1533.06]  Yeah.
[1533.18 --> 1534.92]  Well, I've been on the edge a long time then.
[1536.14 --> 1537.24]  Well, welcome to the fold.
[1537.42 --> 1538.26]  It goes away.
[1538.32 --> 1538.72]  It's fine.
[1538.82 --> 1543.88]  It's only a lifelong issue that you'll have for the remainder of your living years.
[1543.88 --> 1546.06]  Yeah, it was really bad a couple years ago, actually.
[1546.18 --> 1552.04]  About three years ago, I was having a lot of trouble with cold and pain in my wrist.
[1552.16 --> 1552.32]  Wow.
[1553.22 --> 1554.34]  Old people problems.
[1554.84 --> 1555.24]  Wow.
[1555.50 --> 1556.40]  I guess we can continue.
[1556.40 --> 1556.50]  Ouch.
[1557.34 --> 1557.92]  That does hurt.
[1558.76 --> 1560.88]  I think I'm older than both of you, right?
[1561.20 --> 1561.48]  Linus hurt?
[1561.48 --> 1562.64]  Probably combined, I think.
[1562.70 --> 1562.88]  Yeah.
[1563.20 --> 1563.94]  Oh, ouch.
[1564.02 --> 1564.84]  That hurts.
[1565.48 --> 1565.88]  Ouch.
[1565.88 --> 1565.98]  Ouch.
[1565.98 --> 1570.48]  Yeah, I think you're a little older than me.
[1570.54 --> 1571.00]  I'm 28.
[1571.34 --> 1571.98]  Yeah, I'm 33.
[1572.34 --> 1572.46]  Okay.
[1573.18 --> 1573.66]  Damn, ouch.
[1574.38 --> 1575.06]  All right.
[1575.20 --> 1578.42]  Well, I think, yeah, I'll let you get to your thing.
[1578.48 --> 1581.98]  I think I had said we'd kick you off at five.
[1582.06 --> 1586.38]  We're also dropping frames on the stream that I think are due to the video call right now.
[1586.38 --> 1588.54]  So we've got to let you go regardless.
[1588.90 --> 1595.88]  Are you hitting that 3.5 gigabyte frame buffer limit, and you're going into the secondary pool of memory, maybe?
[1595.98 --> 1596.28]  Is that...
[1596.28 --> 1596.92]  It's much slower.
[1597.30 --> 1597.88]  It's much slower.
[1598.38 --> 1599.42]  I think I...
[1599.42 --> 1601.78]  What do I deserve in exchange for this?
[1601.88 --> 1605.08]  No, see, this is the backup memory area.
[1605.42 --> 1605.70]  Right.
[1605.80 --> 1607.16]  So that's why it's still working at all.
[1607.34 --> 1609.36]  We should be thankful that the stream is still on.
[1610.16 --> 1612.02]  And then it's not just dropping some frames.
[1613.00 --> 1613.98]  This is the memory boost.
[1613.98 --> 1615.84]  Wait, no, I don't have my shill sweater on.
[1616.14 --> 1616.34]  There.
[1616.92 --> 1617.20]  That's much better.
[1617.20 --> 1618.60]  Memory boost 2.0.
[1618.72 --> 1620.82]  Now it's like a shill shawl, right?
[1620.82 --> 1621.06]  Yeah.
[1621.66 --> 1622.48]  Shill scarf.
[1622.90 --> 1623.16]  Nice.
[1623.16 --> 1626.94]  As long as it doesn't turn into like a shill noose, then we're good.
[1627.24 --> 1627.56]  All right.
[1627.70 --> 1628.08]  All right.
[1629.28 --> 1631.22]  Before I go, plug...
[1631.22 --> 1631.40]  Yes.
[1631.40 --> 1634.64]  Before you're into your show, go ahead and plug our YouTube channels and websites and everything
[1634.64 --> 1635.80]  so we can get all that stuff.
[1635.80 --> 1636.36]  Yes, do that.
[1636.38 --> 1636.84]  Do that now.
[1636.92 --> 1637.12]  Do that now.
[1637.12 --> 1637.74]  All right.
[1637.82 --> 1642.66]  So PCPer.com, that's where you're going to see all the stories on the 970 issue or the
[1642.66 --> 1643.22]  mobile G-Sync.
[1643.28 --> 1644.00]  We've got that there.
[1644.50 --> 1648.62]  And then we compete directly with Linus and Luke on YouTubes, right?
[1648.62 --> 1652.28]  And nobody has enough time to watch any videos, but if you go to YouTube.com slash PCPer,
[1652.28 --> 1657.10]  you can see some of our crap there and try to figure out what all this red light is behind
[1657.10 --> 1658.16]  me as well.
[1658.30 --> 1659.32]  The red light district.
[1660.60 --> 1661.48]  We can change it.
[1661.52 --> 1662.56]  We can make it a green light district.
[1662.68 --> 1666.30]  But I see, unlike you, I decided I don't want the background to be green if I'm going to
[1666.30 --> 1667.90]  sit here and talk about NVIDIA stuff.
[1668.60 --> 1669.24]  And so you...
[1669.24 --> 1673.36]  And then I come on and you're wearing the NVIDIA hoodie that we got at the G-Sync Editor's
[1673.36 --> 1674.06]  Day, which is...
[1674.06 --> 1675.14]  It's a nice shirt.
[1675.28 --> 1676.56]  It really is a nice...
[1676.56 --> 1677.28]  Isn't it nice?
[1677.28 --> 1678.82]  I wanted one, to be honest.
[1678.86 --> 1682.54]  I feel like such a corporate whore wearing it.
[1682.86 --> 1684.62]  Like, I put the thing on and then...
[1684.62 --> 1685.90]  So it just adds the word corporate?
[1686.14 --> 1686.60]  And then...
[1686.60 --> 1687.02]  Thank you.
[1687.34 --> 1693.46]  And then that super nice one we got at the Maxwell event, too, at the 970 event.
[1693.74 --> 1694.36]  That jacket.
[1694.66 --> 1695.34]  That windbreaker.
[1695.72 --> 1697.12]  Yeah, that is actually really nice.
[1697.26 --> 1698.26]  I have worn that.
[1698.38 --> 1700.20]  When I went to Montreal a couple weeks ago, I took that.
[1700.24 --> 1700.90]  It was very nice.
[1701.60 --> 1703.18]  But I don't let any...
[1703.18 --> 1705.62]  I don't let myself wear it when I go out to other events.
[1705.62 --> 1707.54]  I don't let myself wear it when we're on video.
[1708.12 --> 1714.62]  If Alan's here doing a storage video with me and he's got an Intel Skull logo t-shirt,
[1714.70 --> 1715.88]  I'm like, sorry, you got to go change shirts.
[1715.96 --> 1716.64]  We're not doing that.
[1717.18 --> 1719.68]  I'm not going to bring those comments upon us.
[1720.18 --> 1722.10]  But hey, thanks for having me on, guys.
[1722.30 --> 1724.02]  And good luck the rest of your show.
[1724.38 --> 1724.66]  All right.
[1724.70 --> 1725.26]  Take care, man.
[1725.54 --> 1727.50]  Good to talk to you, as always.
[1727.96 --> 1728.22]  See ya.
[1729.76 --> 1730.28]  Hold on.
[1730.36 --> 1730.62]  Hold on.
[1730.72 --> 1731.04]  Let me...
[1731.04 --> 1731.60]  There we go.
[1731.60 --> 1732.08]  There you go.
[1732.18 --> 1732.48]  You're good.
[1735.20 --> 1735.56]  No.
[1736.06 --> 1736.46]  Thanks, Ryan.
[1736.60 --> 1736.78]  Okay.
[1736.88 --> 1737.12]  Bye-bye.
[1737.46 --> 1737.78]  All right.
[1738.14 --> 1738.42]  There we go.
[1738.42 --> 1738.88]  All right.
[1738.98 --> 1743.00]  So, guys, welcome back to our regularly scheduled content.
[1743.18 --> 1745.44]  Where we talk about things that happened this week.
[1745.52 --> 1745.82]  Yeah.
[1746.00 --> 1750.90]  So, the LG G4 is rumored to feature a 3K display.
[1751.26 --> 1752.60]  Let's go ahead and...
[1753.14 --> 1754.38]  Oh, hold on a second here.
[1754.98 --> 1756.50]  Let me just make sure that I...
[1756.50 --> 1760.44]  While you're setting that up, I'm going to do call-outs for the ULTT StarCraft League winners
[1760.44 --> 1764.94]  of January, Kane won the official league, which is like the...
[1764.94 --> 1766.22]  Not the tech syndicate Kane.
[1766.40 --> 1766.60]  No.
[1766.76 --> 1767.14]  Oh, okay.
[1767.22 --> 1767.50]  Definitely.
[1767.50 --> 1767.78]  Definitely.
[1768.06 --> 1768.28]  No.
[1769.52 --> 1774.72]  K-A-Y-N won the official league, which is like the ULTT members league.
[1775.06 --> 1778.62]  And Commander Fett won the public league, which is the best score against the public.
[1779.76 --> 1780.20]  Okay.
[1780.56 --> 1781.94]  That is...
[1781.94 --> 1783.42]  What is going on here?
[1783.70 --> 1784.58]  I don't really...
[1784.58 --> 1786.42]  Oh, I know what the issue is.
[1786.42 --> 1792.86]  The issue is that my screen sharing is no longer working.
[1793.66 --> 1795.84]  Is the AetherMedia plugged in?
[1796.08 --> 1796.32]  Yeah.
[1797.96 --> 1799.44]  Did it fall out?
[1799.56 --> 1800.00]  Okay.
[1800.92 --> 1802.82]  So, source.
[1805.22 --> 1805.82]  Okay.
[1805.82 --> 1806.98]  Can we try a different plug?
[1807.06 --> 1807.92]  We can try again.
[1808.16 --> 1809.82]  Could it be a USB compatibility thing?
[1809.92 --> 1810.60]  That's not it.
[1810.60 --> 1816.74]  I straight up don't understand what's going on here.
[1816.90 --> 1818.28]  So, we can remove that.
[1818.94 --> 1820.60]  And then we can add camera.
[1822.20 --> 1824.46]  And it will be correct.
[1824.66 --> 1825.14]  Wow.
[1825.26 --> 1826.16]  I love this show.
[1826.58 --> 1826.88]  Okay.
[1827.76 --> 1829.60]  So, let's go ahead and...
[1830.44 --> 1832.86]  The WAN show, where we talk about things that happened last week.
[1832.98 --> 1835.54]  Carpal tunnel, being old, and we don't prep things.
[1835.54 --> 1835.98]  Yeah.
[1836.14 --> 1839.22]  So, the LG G4 to feature a 3K display.
[1839.50 --> 1840.18]  This is rumored.
[1840.28 --> 1841.44]  It showed up in some of the specs.
[1841.78 --> 1846.10]  The rumors also point to a slightly smaller 5.3-inch display.
[1846.68 --> 1855.54]  It'll be 1620 by 2880 pixels, which would be a pixel density of around 626 pixels per inch,
[1855.66 --> 1858.48]  which is very impressive and completely unnecessary.
[1858.48 --> 1867.82]  The G3 had a 5.5-inch display and a 2560 by 1440p screen, which resulted in 538 ppi.
[1867.94 --> 1869.38]  And that was already kind of ridiculous.
[1869.90 --> 1872.16]  It went from 538 to 626.
[1872.56 --> 1874.22]  I already straight up couldn't tell.
[1874.60 --> 1876.02]  I don't have terrible eyes.
[1876.12 --> 1879.14]  I'm wearing glasses this week, but my close-up vision is just fine.
[1879.88 --> 1884.58]  And it doesn't make a difference past about 1080p.
[1884.76 --> 1887.88]  And now going past 1440p, it definitely doesn't make a difference.
[1887.88 --> 1895.68]  What I would like to see instead is higher density displays in other form factors, most
[1895.68 --> 1899.36]  notably on the desktop, because the issue, actually, this is something I talk about in
[1899.36 --> 1900.82]  our XPS 13 review.
[1902.08 --> 1908.66]  So, that display is also a 3K display, and the notebook is also available in a 1080p version.
[1909.28 --> 1915.98]  Dell quotes the 1080p's battery life as 25% higher.
[1915.98 --> 1920.18]  Again, you can force a mobile screen to be smaller.
[1920.88 --> 1921.28]  Smaller.
[1921.30 --> 1922.22]  Well, you're talking about laptops.
[1922.36 --> 1924.76]  On phones, you can force different resolutions.
[1925.28 --> 1925.80]  Oh, yeah.
[1925.88 --> 1926.50]  No, that's fine.
[1926.58 --> 1933.36]  I just mean the additional power required to drive all these pixels is something that
[1933.36 --> 1936.76]  I don't know if I necessarily agree on with a mobile device.
[1936.76 --> 1946.08]  And it should be noted that on the XPS 13 2015, that's a lot of numbers, the 1080p models also
[1946.08 --> 1947.66]  tend to have lower spec CPUs.
[1947.66 --> 1949.14]  So, there's going to be some savings there as well.
[1949.24 --> 1954.10]  And Dell is obviously just approximating, you know, these higher power models get about this
[1954.10 --> 1954.42]  much less.
[1954.42 --> 1961.26]  So, it's 12 hours on the high-end one and 15 hours on the low-end one of rated battery.
[1961.40 --> 1962.80]  It's a very significant difference.
[1963.06 --> 1963.40]  Yeah, actually.
[1963.58 --> 1965.88]  And I got to look at it and go, well, hold on a second.
[1966.00 --> 1973.32]  Like, if we just didn't worry so much about all these pixels that, especially on a laptop
[1973.32 --> 1978.92]  where you're running Windows 8 and scaling is a complete disaster, it just doesn't make
[1978.92 --> 1979.80]  a ton of sense to me.
[1980.88 --> 1981.26]  All right.
[1981.46 --> 1984.00]  Microsoft now pays Adblock Plus.
[1984.12 --> 1984.84]  Are you posting this?
[1984.96 --> 1985.54]  One thing, sure.
[1985.66 --> 1989.30]  One thing we really need to remember with this article is that Adblock Plus is not the
[1989.30 --> 1991.22]  same as all the different versions of Adblock.
[1991.22 --> 1995.52]  Yeah, there's Adblock, Adblock Plus, other things that Adblock adds.
[1996.80 --> 2002.34]  So, this is specifically Adblock Plus, who we've given a hard time to on this show in
[2002.34 --> 2005.12]  the past about the whole mafia style.
[2005.50 --> 2005.72]  Yeah.
[2005.72 --> 2009.52]  You get paid for security or whatever.
[2009.54 --> 2010.94]  Yeah, protection money.
[2011.16 --> 2011.62]  Protection, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2012.04 --> 2019.02]  But it looks like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Taboola are all paying to have advertisements
[2019.02 --> 2023.90]  go unblocked on their websites for users that are running Adblock Plus.
[2024.38 --> 2028.58]  So, I don't know who they're trying to make happy here.
[2029.48 --> 2032.32]  Obviously, their users are not going to be super thrilled.
[2032.32 --> 2041.58]  Unless their users are those users who are only trying to block malicious ads, for example.
[2041.76 --> 2042.26]  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2042.26 --> 2049.42]  And if the idea was, okay, you know, a site like Microsoft.com is probably vetting the,
[2049.42 --> 2052.78]  you know, the ads, making sure that there's no malicious code in them.
[2053.64 --> 2060.12]  If the idea is they're kind of going, okay, yeah, you're paying us for the service of validating
[2060.12 --> 2062.22]  that your ads are not malicious.
[2063.30 --> 2064.90]  Okay, I've had enough devil's advocate.
[2065.02 --> 2065.96]  This is such nonsense.
[2066.64 --> 2069.36]  Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous, but I kind of think they're all ridiculous.
[2069.36 --> 2070.32]  So, I don't know.
[2072.42 --> 2076.68]  I'm kind of surprised, like, I don't know how much exactly they're paying, but I'm kind
[2076.68 --> 2079.26]  of surprised these big companies are actually paying for that.
[2079.62 --> 2084.44]  Well, the way that, okay, the way that the whole program works is much smaller websites,
[2084.80 --> 2086.74]  like very small websites, don't have to pay.
[2086.84 --> 2091.36]  I think they just submit, they just submit an application to be white listed.
[2091.60 --> 2091.78]  Yeah.
[2091.78 --> 2096.08]  Whereas much larger businesses are intended to pay.
[2096.22 --> 2096.38]  Right.
[2096.54 --> 2098.86]  And I guess Microsoft is probably doing it for MSN.
[2100.46 --> 2101.60]  MSN.com or whatever.
[2101.74 --> 2104.62]  They're like kind of homepage thingy where I think there is actually a bunch of ads.
[2104.62 --> 2106.08]  I would imagine it's kind of across the board.
[2106.42 --> 2108.28]  Yeah, but that's probably the one they're actually worried about.
[2108.50 --> 2110.04]  MSN Video would be another big one.
[2110.16 --> 2112.56]  Man, the ads are obnoxious on MSN Video.
[2112.76 --> 2112.78]  Yeah, they are.
[2112.78 --> 2112.94]  Yeah.
[2112.94 --> 2118.34]  Every once in a while, I kind of fall down the rabbit hole on MSN Video because they tend
[2118.34 --> 2122.22]  to have a lot of really short, like 10, 15 second, you know, stupid clips.
[2122.36 --> 2122.96]  Clickable things.
[2123.02 --> 2123.20]  Yeah.
[2123.50 --> 2128.88]  And I'll just kind of, and then I'll watch like another 30 second ad to see a 10 second
[2128.88 --> 2129.16]  video.
[2129.24 --> 2130.20]  I'll be like, yeah, I've had enough.
[2130.76 --> 2133.48]  And then that saves the rest of my evening.
[2135.12 --> 2136.62]  Time Warner Cable.
[2138.06 --> 2139.84]  This is actually a great article.
[2139.96 --> 2142.22]  This is posted by, oh, we should go back and.
[2142.22 --> 2143.98]  Extremely unsurprising.
[2144.20 --> 2144.32]  Sorry?
[2144.56 --> 2144.94]  Oh, oh.
[2145.10 --> 2145.18]  Keep going.
[2145.18 --> 2147.76]  QWERTY Warrior posted the 3K display one.
[2148.20 --> 2150.16]  Goodbytes posted about Adblock Plus.
[2150.52 --> 2152.50]  And this one is from Victoria's Secret.
[2152.66 --> 2154.22]  Do you want to go ahead and post this in the chat?
[2154.34 --> 2154.46]  Sure.
[2156.08 --> 2163.28]  Time Warner Cable's 97% profit margin on high speed internet service exposed.
[2163.28 --> 2172.62]  Actually, the digging that was done by the author of this article is not particularly deep.
[2172.74 --> 2176.56]  I mean, all he really had to do was look at some of the numbers that they are providing
[2176.56 --> 2182.80]  us on the telephone and on the voice side of things and some other stuff and then kind
[2182.80 --> 2186.32]  of reverse engineer the numbers for high speed internet.
[2186.94 --> 2189.22]  And it raises some really interesting questions.
[2189.34 --> 2192.74]  If they're making 97% margin.
[2193.20 --> 2197.90]  So he worked it out and he figures, where is it?
[2197.90 --> 2205.96]  Their average subscription is $40 something, $43.92 per month.
[2206.12 --> 2213.52]  And their average cost is $1.32 per month for the service that they're providing to that
[2213.52 --> 2213.96]  customer.
[2214.16 --> 2216.48]  And he raises some really interesting questions.
[2217.00 --> 2220.28]  How did no regulatory body ever look at this?
[2220.28 --> 2223.48]  Who makes 97% margin on anything?
[2226.10 --> 2230.78]  Especially where it's been proven that there's essentially no competition in terms of ISPs in
[2230.78 --> 2231.14]  the States.
[2231.46 --> 2231.70]  Yeah.
[2232.12 --> 2234.68]  It's essentially localized monopolies.
[2234.78 --> 2235.00]  Yeah.
[2235.10 --> 2235.86]  Which is ridiculous.
[2236.68 --> 2243.28]  So you're basically forcing, because the internet is basically required at this point, you're basically
[2243.28 --> 2248.52]  forcing people to buy something that you are serving them at a 97% profit margin, which
[2248.52 --> 2249.38]  is insanity.
[2250.28 --> 2252.14]  That's absolutely insanity.
[2252.90 --> 2253.46]  Oh, man.
[2254.54 --> 2260.52]  It's also interesting that the reported, it's reported that fees have increased by about
[2260.52 --> 2263.62]  100% in a matter of two years, for some customers.
[2263.86 --> 2271.66]  Yeah, this was, this seems like this is an article that the author kind of had close to his heart,
[2271.78 --> 2277.50]  because he was actually talking about how his personal Time Warner Cable basic triple play
[2277.50 --> 2285.26]  bill went up 112% in just two years, from the advertised price of $89.99 to $190.77.
[2285.68 --> 2286.74]  That's insane.
[2286.88 --> 2291.50]  It includes all kinds of fees and surcharges and rental this.
[2291.50 --> 2300.04]  And one of them is a defunct social contract charge, which is an extra $5 a month that hasn't
[2300.04 --> 2303.22]  actually been required apparently since 2001.
[2303.22 --> 2306.26]  Oh my god.
[2307.40 --> 2309.12]  You should be able to get your money back for that.
[2309.48 --> 2309.80]  Yeah.
[2310.36 --> 2312.80]  Because isn't that, it shouldn't, okay, social contract, what is that?
[2312.86 --> 2318.28]  Okay, I think the fee was implemented and then taken off the bill, but then the money
[2318.28 --> 2320.28]  is still being charged or something like that.
[2320.28 --> 2322.40]  Okay, so Time Warner's not necessarily taking that $5?
[2322.40 --> 2323.84]  No, they're just jacking up the price.
[2323.98 --> 2324.06]  Yeah.
[2324.24 --> 2325.40]  They're taking a $5.
[2326.20 --> 2326.56]  Yeah.
[2327.74 --> 2328.18]  No.
[2329.18 --> 2330.78]  It's not necessarily that $5.
[2331.28 --> 2332.58]  Is it a form of tax though?
[2332.64 --> 2334.24]  Like, is this a government regulated thing?
[2335.00 --> 2338.14]  I don't know too much about the social contract thing.
[2338.20 --> 2341.26]  Yeah, because social contract sounds like some sort of...
[2341.26 --> 2343.90]  Oh yeah, it was supposed to be to fund the upgrade to the network.
[2344.14 --> 2344.40]  Yeah.
[2344.58 --> 2344.80]  Yeah.
[2344.80 --> 2347.22]  Yeah, like that's what it was supposed to be for.
[2347.30 --> 2347.50]  Okay.
[2347.82 --> 2349.24]  Uh, but...
[2349.24 --> 2353.36]  Oh, so for it to fund, I guess it could just go directly to them.
[2353.48 --> 2353.66]  Yeah.
[2354.40 --> 2354.96]  Oh, that's for real.
[2354.96 --> 2357.50]  If the network's good enough, then, uh, hey.
[2357.86 --> 2360.12]  Hey, and it's not, so hey.
[2360.22 --> 2360.66]  So hey.
[2361.84 --> 2365.18]  Yeah, how about them social contract service charges?
[2365.80 --> 2367.28]  You want to upgrade some things, please?
[2367.96 --> 2370.46]  I'm going to enter into my own social contract.
[2370.80 --> 2372.04]  Well, some cities are.
[2372.46 --> 2373.72]  They're installing their own networks.
[2373.88 --> 2374.00]  Yep.
[2374.00 --> 2374.80]  They're actually baller.
[2375.28 --> 2376.66]  So, um, yeah.
[2376.88 --> 2379.98]  So one of the ones I didn't bring up was franchise fees.
[2380.60 --> 2380.92]  Um...
[2380.92 --> 2381.12]  Ugh.
[2381.34 --> 2381.76]  Yeah.
[2381.98 --> 2382.70]  What does it even mean?
[2382.78 --> 2382.94]  Ugh.
[2382.94 --> 2383.42]  Super gross.
[2383.50 --> 2390.38]  So this is all based on 2013 records, but I, I mean, I knew that they were doing just fine.
[2390.76 --> 2396.52]  All we have to do is look at the, you know, all the commercial space they buy on TV and
[2396.52 --> 2399.98]  all the stadiums that these companies name and all this stuff.
[2400.06 --> 2403.98]  We can look at it and go, okay, they're spending all that money and they're still doing fine.
[2404.68 --> 2407.26]  Um, but I, I had no idea.
[2407.26 --> 2411.80]  It was 3% of the actual, of it was the actual cost.
[2411.80 --> 2412.28]  What?
[2412.28 --> 2415.88]  Like clothes, perfume, and makeup are some of the most...
[2415.88 --> 2416.50]  Printer ink.
[2416.92 --> 2417.16]  Yes.
[2417.26 --> 2417.66]  Printer ink.
[2417.82 --> 2418.02]  Yeah.
[2418.02 --> 2418.28]  That's another one.
[2418.28 --> 2422.58]  Like all those things that are just ridiculous where like the, the nicest bottle of wine
[2422.58 --> 2427.06]  like ever is still very comparable to printer ink in terms of prices.
[2427.60 --> 2428.76]  Uh, I, I don't remember.
[2428.76 --> 2430.02]  That was an article a long time ago.
[2430.10 --> 2433.34]  I did to, I probably quoted it slightly wrong, but it was ridiculous.
[2433.70 --> 2434.58]  Um, yeah.
[2434.58 --> 2437.42]  The bit about drinking the printer ink instead of the wine.
[2437.54 --> 2438.82]  I think that was the part you screwed up.
[2438.94 --> 2439.80]  That wasn't in there.
[2439.94 --> 2440.94]  I didn't say that.
[2441.06 --> 2441.64]  No, you didn't.
[2442.08 --> 2442.48]  Anyways.
[2442.72 --> 2444.12]  Uh, but it was funnier.
[2444.12 --> 2444.60]  Yes.
[2445.14 --> 2447.26]  Um, like that's nuts though.
[2447.34 --> 2448.40]  That's absolutely ridiculous.
[2448.90 --> 2451.36]  I wish our margin was 97%.
[2451.36 --> 2454.88]  I guess what I could do is just slash all of your salaries.
[2455.24 --> 2456.58]  I think that's illegal.
[2457.42 --> 2459.12]  Well, this isn't.
[2460.20 --> 2462.46]  This, no, that, that isn't legal.
[2463.20 --> 2464.44]  I said, I think that is illegal.
[2464.86 --> 2465.20]  Mm.
[2465.46 --> 2466.78]  Isn't would mean that it's legal.
[2466.94 --> 2467.22]  Right.
[2467.64 --> 2470.66]  I don't know if what they're doing is like actually documented as legal.
[2470.98 --> 2473.10]  Cause there's, there's questions to be brought up.
[2473.18 --> 2474.30]  This is a very old conversation.
[2474.44 --> 2476.92]  So I won't delve into it for very long, but where the government's like,
[2477.02 --> 2478.76]  here's money to build this stuff.
[2478.82 --> 2479.82]  Then you just don't do it.
[2479.88 --> 2480.82]  That should be under contract.
[2480.82 --> 2481.72]  That should be illegal.
[2482.44 --> 2484.26]  I don't think there's any punishment for that.
[2484.42 --> 2484.74]  Yeah.
[2485.00 --> 2485.98]  There should be something.
[2486.12 --> 2486.72]  There should be.
[2487.06 --> 2488.18]  Anyways, we should carry on.
[2488.18 --> 2489.62]  Cause that's a very old, very.
[2489.66 --> 2492.94]  And when Target goes out of business in Canada and says,
[2493.02 --> 2494.32]  they're going to have amazing deals.
[2494.32 --> 2496.14]  And my wife goes there on Thursday.
[2496.14 --> 2497.52]  There should be amazing deals.
[2497.68 --> 2498.26]  Was there nothing?
[2498.26 --> 2503.22]  Apparently the stores were just, the store was just like packed and people were buying
[2503.22 --> 2507.92]  things, but she ended up leaving and going to superstore to buy some garbage cans for
[2507.92 --> 2510.18]  the new office because she knew they were actually on sale.
[2510.96 --> 2516.22]  Um, the electronics department apparently was so full of people that there was a lineup
[2516.22 --> 2516.82]  to get in.
[2516.86 --> 2521.82]  So she didn't actually go to the electronics, but apparently just cause I, I sent her there
[2521.82 --> 2525.82]  cause we're going to need some sundries for the new office and things like toilet paper,
[2525.82 --> 2528.74]  cleaning supplies, um, stuff like that.
[2528.78 --> 2530.32]  And I was like, yeah, just pick up some of that stuff.
[2530.38 --> 2532.46]  I mean, it should be like Uber liquidation sale.
[2532.98 --> 2537.38]  And apparently it's as simple as just saying you're having a liquidation sale and people
[2537.38 --> 2540.36]  come and they buy things and they should just, they should do that thing.
[2540.60 --> 2541.00]  Okay.
[2541.10 --> 2544.36]  I don't know about you viewers, but this is a total thing here.
[2544.78 --> 2547.50]  Grand opening and like final closing sale thing.
[2547.50 --> 2548.60]  Furniture stores.
[2548.76 --> 2556.02]  I swear every single furniture store on like, um, Bridgeport road and, uh, and King George
[2556.02 --> 2560.44]  Boulevard in Richmond and Surrey, like, like you, you, you drive through furniture store
[2560.44 --> 2563.76]  land and especially the smaller ones, not the big chain ones.
[2563.94 --> 2571.24]  Like half of them are having their moving sale or, or liquidation sale or closing down final
[2571.24 --> 2573.00]  inventory closeout sale.
[2573.28 --> 2574.90]  Grand opening for like six years.
[2574.90 --> 2575.46]  Yeah.
[2575.78 --> 2580.00]  There's actually a documented thing where one of the stores in BC had a grand opening
[2580.00 --> 2581.66]  sale for years.
[2581.96 --> 2585.02]  And I mean like the sign is faded, you know?
[2585.10 --> 2585.72]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2585.76 --> 2587.44]  Like it's old and faded and ripping.
[2587.58 --> 2592.24]  What did you buy someone else's used grand opening sale sign and put it on it?
[2592.28 --> 2592.86]  Or if you just.
[2593.90 --> 2594.38]  Ridiculous.
[2594.60 --> 2595.28]  Um, all right.
[2595.34 --> 2597.82]  So there's, ah, yes.
[2597.82 --> 2605.84]  A new Intel consumer SSD 750 series, uh, pops up on a compatibility list.
[2605.90 --> 2606.44]  So this is cool.
[2606.50 --> 2608.06]  The code name is August Ridge.
[2608.20 --> 2609.42]  It's the month I'm born in.
[2609.50 --> 2612.28]  So it's probably like Illuminati confirmed.
[2612.36 --> 2612.52]  Anyway.
[2612.98 --> 2619.86]  Um, it was on the roadmap for releasing Q4 2014, but that time has passed.
[2619.86 --> 2621.58]  We're still hoping we can see it soon.
[2621.72 --> 2628.18]  And if we do, then that'll make Intel the first one to deliver an NVMe compliant SSD.
[2628.50 --> 2635.12]  So that would be an SSD that doesn't rely on the old fashioned AHCI, uh, software layer
[2635.12 --> 2636.80]  to interface with the controller.
[2636.80 --> 2642.30]  So it would actually, it's optimized for lower latency, uh, most, mostly lower latency.
[2642.46 --> 2647.04]  It's optimized for the lower latency PCI express connections that new SSDs are going to be
[2647.04 --> 2650.72]  connecting to, whether it's over M.2 or over a standard PCI express slot.
[2651.36 --> 2655.50]  Um, capacities will be 180, 240, 360, 480, and 600 gigs.
[2656.08 --> 2658.98]  And, um, yeah.
[2660.42 --> 2662.40]  That's honestly, there isn't a ton to say.
[2662.46 --> 2664.02]  I'm excited to see them in person.
[2664.84 --> 2665.82]  Faster SSDs are good.
[2665.96 --> 2666.22]  Yes.
[2666.22 --> 2667.26]  For lots of things.
[2667.40 --> 2667.60]  Yes.
[2667.78 --> 2672.44]  I mean, here's something you might not even consider, you know, if your SSD in your laptop
[2672.44 --> 2674.66]  or your phone is much higher performance.
[2674.76 --> 2674.88]  Okay.
[2674.88 --> 2679.42]  Phones are bad example, cause we're not getting this in phones, but on your laptop, uh, is,
[2679.48 --> 2683.62]  is using a PCI express bus and is using NVMe.
[2683.78 --> 2688.40]  The faster it can complete any transactions that it has to, the more it's sitting there
[2688.40 --> 2689.68]  idle instead of working.
[2689.86 --> 2694.32]  So as long as we get nice power efficient, super high speed SSDs, it's kind of like, um,
[2694.32 --> 2702.18]  it's kind of like how faster wifi actually benefits more than just, you know, oh, okay.
[2702.18 --> 2703.72]  There's less stuff sitting in the air.
[2703.80 --> 2704.40]  That's right.
[2704.68 --> 2705.00]  That's right.
[2705.00 --> 2709.18]  It makes everything else that's on that network faster because you're not using up as much
[2709.18 --> 2709.50]  airtime.
[2709.54 --> 2709.84]  It's good.
[2710.08 --> 2710.22]  Yeah.
[2710.22 --> 2713.40]  Sony has sold Sony online entertainment.
[2715.18 --> 2718.54]  I, that's, I'm actually kind of surprised they sold it, especially with the timing because
[2718.54 --> 2724.16]  H1Z1, despite the highly controversial launch, actually seemed to be doing pretty well.
[2724.22 --> 2724.60]  Well, okay.
[2724.90 --> 2728.16]  Launch into early active, early access.
[2728.54 --> 2728.74]  Sorry.
[2728.80 --> 2729.98]  I keep not posting links.
[2730.08 --> 2731.08]  I keep forgetting to say who posted.
[2731.08 --> 2732.64]  I've done, I've posted all the other ones.
[2732.64 --> 2735.46]  It's me and KingCry for the last two posting on the forum.
[2735.58 --> 2735.90]  Thanks guys.
[2735.94 --> 2736.78]  This one is KingCry.
[2737.04 --> 2741.42]  Um, yeah, like, is that even proper terminology now?
[2741.54 --> 2743.26]  Cause that wasn't even a real launch, was it?
[2743.30 --> 2745.38]  I'm pretty sure H1Z1 is still in early access.
[2745.70 --> 2746.16]  I think so, yeah.
[2746.18 --> 2749.68]  But then people were like, oh my God, the servers aren't good enough because early access
[2749.68 --> 2751.52]  literally doesn't mean early access anymore.
[2752.10 --> 2754.40]  Um, you just buy the game.
[2754.52 --> 2755.22]  You just bought the game.
[2755.28 --> 2755.86]  You're playing the game.
[2756.30 --> 2757.46]  Anyways, dumb.
[2757.46 --> 2762.36]  Um, but yeah, apparently the company that bought it, which has a terrible name of Daybreak
[2762.36 --> 2763.22]  Game Company.
[2764.12 --> 2767.06]  Well, no, they renamed it to Daybreak Game Company.
[2767.30 --> 2768.62]  Yeah, which is terrible.
[2768.62 --> 2768.64]  Yeah, which is terrible.
[2768.64 --> 2769.24]  It was bought by, uh.
[2769.24 --> 2770.72]  Well, it was bought by, like, a holding company.
[2770.94 --> 2771.70]  Columbus Nova.
[2771.88 --> 2774.38]  Yeah, New York's based investment management firm.
[2774.38 --> 2776.24]  But Daybreak Game Company?
[2777.22 --> 2777.66]  Really?
[2779.22 --> 2787.44]  Um, they make games until, they work until so late at night the sun comes up.
[2787.46 --> 2790.34]  That, that might actually be true if you're a programmer.
[2790.52 --> 2790.68]  Yeah.
[2790.88 --> 2792.94]  So, maybe not that far from the truth.
[2792.96 --> 2796.88]  Actually, maybe it's the best name for a game company ever.
[2798.50 --> 2800.58]  I just didn't like that they're called Game Company.
[2801.38 --> 2802.10]  I don't know why.
[2802.34 --> 2803.68]  I'm sure there's other ones out there called that.
[2803.68 --> 2807.40]  Aren't we called, so I shouldn't have called us Linus Media Company?
[2807.40 --> 2809.72]  I have never said that that was a good name.
[2810.18 --> 2810.46]  Right.
[2810.46 --> 2813.14]  I have forever said that that was a terrible name.
[2814.36 --> 2815.12]  Moving on.
[2815.12 --> 2815.68]  Um.
[2815.68 --> 2816.10]  What did you want?
[2816.16 --> 2817.74]  Like, dishwater reg?
[2817.94 --> 2820.82]  Anything other than Linus Media Group.
[2821.10 --> 2821.44]  Anyways.
[2822.62 --> 2827.44]  Um, they're looking into, they said that they want to fully embrace the multi-platform world
[2827.44 --> 2828.70]  in which we all live.
[2829.02 --> 2833.12]  So, that's bringing up theories that they're going to bring H1Z1 to consoles, which is probably
[2833.12 --> 2833.94]  not too surprising.
[2834.42 --> 2834.98]  And mobile.
[2834.98 --> 2837.06]  You just said H1N1 to consoles.
[2837.24 --> 2837.48]  Did I?
[2837.70 --> 2838.04]  Yeah.
[2838.24 --> 2838.60]  Hopefully.
[2838.62 --> 2840.46]  We're bringing viruses to consoles.
[2840.46 --> 2844.88]  H1Z1 is what I meant to say.
[2845.36 --> 2849.48]  Uh, and apparently they're interested in possible mobile crap in the future.
[2849.78 --> 2851.98]  So, nothing was interesting for us.
[2852.12 --> 2853.62]  Not all mobile stuff is crap.
[2854.20 --> 2854.62]  Um.
[2855.20 --> 2857.76]  Square Enix keeps remaking Final Fantasy for mobile.
[2857.98 --> 2858.68]  Those are good games.
[2860.68 --> 2861.12]  Oh.
[2861.86 --> 2862.28]  Pokemon.
[2862.66 --> 2864.08]  Pokemon Blue is a mobile game.
[2864.24 --> 2864.40]  Bam.
[2864.84 --> 2865.10]  No.
[2865.10 --> 2865.22]  Oh.
[2865.22 --> 2869.90]  Technically, yes.
[2870.98 --> 2873.14]  Not the mobile I'm currently talking about.
[2873.14 --> 2875.30]  You just, you just got trashed, son.
[2875.40 --> 2876.66]  But technically, yes.
[2877.22 --> 2878.52]  That is not wrong.
[2878.64 --> 2878.92]  Okay.
[2879.30 --> 2879.66]  Uh.
[2880.66 --> 2881.86]  Oh, this is a shame.
[2881.86 --> 2882.22]  Moving on.
[2882.26 --> 2883.56]  This was posted by Goodbytes.
[2883.58 --> 2884.06]  This is brutal.
[2884.22 --> 2886.96]  This is like, like, I'll post it in the chat.
[2887.18 --> 2887.26]  Alright, right.
[2887.42 --> 2889.56]  This is like a supreme ouch moment.
[2889.80 --> 2889.98]  Yeah.
[2889.98 --> 2891.14]  Um, so you know how.
[2891.62 --> 2892.80]  Oh, you're posting the broken ones.
[2892.90 --> 2893.90]  Let me, let me do the posting.
[2894.18 --> 2894.54]  Fine.
[2895.22 --> 2895.78]  Um.
[2897.84 --> 2898.66]  This is great.
[2898.94 --> 2900.90]  So, oh, it broke again.
[2901.92 --> 2902.40]  Alright.
[2903.74 --> 2904.58]  Please stop breaking.
[2905.22 --> 2909.76]  Doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop doop.
[2910.44 --> 2912.98]  Aaaaaaaand, bippity bippity no.
[2913.54 --> 2913.92]  Okay.
[2915.00 --> 2915.82]  I don't know.
[2919.92 --> 2920.84]  Can they hear us?
[2920.94 --> 2923.04]  Yeah, that's not what I meant to do.
[2923.14 --> 2923.82]  Now we're really big.
[2924.00 --> 2924.66]  Hi, everyone.
[2924.66 --> 2928.66]  Yeah, this is a fairly large area that I've always been really big larger this
[2929.14 --> 2932.66]  Larger than the area that we normally are when we're showing you now. We're going oh
[2935.70 --> 2938.76]  It's kind of fun just start talking go just go
[2938.76 --> 2943.02]  I think this is a terrible idea. Okay. I got Apple will spend two
[2943.60 --> 2949.28]  Billion to turn its failed sapphire plant into a global command center
[2949.28 --> 2956.84]  So you know how the rumor was that the iPhone 6 and 6 plus would feature sapphire glass screens and there was that
[2957.26 --> 2963.46]  Viral video that Marcus Brownlee made where he tried to scratch it and he bent it and was like
[2963.78 --> 2968.18]  Sapphire glass is kind of amazing. Okay, you can put us in the corner now
[2969.14 --> 2971.14]  Sapphire glass is amazing. Well
[2972.08 --> 2979.04]  The company that Apple was actually had actually thrown a lot of money at and who had committed to deliver
[2979.28 --> 2983.12]  the volume of sapphire glass that Apple required in order to
[2983.60 --> 2989.04]  Integrate this product on to blah not just the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 plus, but lots of their yeah
[2989.04 --> 2991.60]  Lots of their products including the Apple watch well
[2991.60 --> 2998.26]  They gt advanced technologies like straight up realized that they couldn't do it and filed for bankruptcy
[2998.32 --> 3001.20]  so the 1.3 million
[3001.20 --> 3007.52]  The million square foot building that Apple built to manufacture sapphire glass will be
[3008.08 --> 3008.88]  um
[3008.88 --> 3010.96]  Not for that. They're gonna make it a data center
[3010.96 --> 3016.72]  Yeah, which makes sense repurpose the building if you can't do it. Yeah, but it's pretty brutal for a few reasons
[3016.72 --> 3019.52]  I mean they could have filled it with trampolines. That would be awesome trampolines
[3019.52 --> 3021.52]  What my company would do
[3021.52 --> 3025.36]  And uh, the ball pits not my company would fill it with trampolines
[3025.84 --> 3030.24]  Not air-conditioned trampolines mind you, but definitely try. I have bad news by the way
[3030.32 --> 3032.88]  The HVAC is definitely on hold for the new office
[3033.68 --> 3036.16]  We are putting in hold on just just calm down
[3036.48 --> 3039.92]  We are and and and okay funny story funny story. You might laugh
[3040.48 --> 3043.60]  We are not only not gonna have air conditioning. We're not gonna have eat
[3043.60 --> 3048.88]  I didn't yeah because it's gonna be a combo unit. I thought it would be when we put it in um, so
[3049.76 --> 3051.36]  The good news is we're putting in the ducting
[3052.56 --> 3056.96]  So we can install HVAC later, but we cannot afford it right now
[3057.60 --> 3062.40]  The sound the sound dampening that we need to do in the warehouse is have you figured more about that?
[3062.40 --> 3069.68]  I have figured out more about that more research is being done. It's going to be very expensive. Is it looking positive into the
[3069.68 --> 3074.64]  Buy some pizza and do it ourselves? Um, i'm not sure okay. Yeah, not sure okay
[3075.92 --> 3081.20]  So sorry what we're talking about right trampolines right they're repurposing it for data center, you know cloud storage
[3081.20 --> 3083.12]  All that kind of stuff is all is all yes
[3083.12 --> 3086.96]  On the the part that I was getting to sorry. I was trying to remember what I was trying to talk about
[3087.36 --> 3096.24]  Um, the the really sucky part in my opinion is that it will now create 150 full-time jobs and 300 to 500 construction jobs temporarily
[3096.24 --> 3101.12]  That sounds pretty cool except that it was supposed to create 2 000 jobs
[3102.40 --> 3109.68]  Permanently bummer now, it's 150. That's a nasty drop. It's one of the largest investments apple has ever made
[3110.32 --> 3117.36]  And although of those 150 it's probably like data center people so people in the audience might be more applicable to be hired
[3118.48 --> 3120.40]  than the sapphire plant so
[3121.52 --> 3125.60]  That might be good for like our group of people, but it's not good for the overall employment number
[3126.56 --> 3131.52]  All right, so this is actually look at this good news from ubisoft
[3132.88 --> 3134.88]  I think this is good
[3134.88 --> 3139.92]  Yeah, but it's like good because they're reeling back from terrible. Oh, it wasn't okay
[3139.92 --> 3144.40]  It's like they shot someone and then they're like hold on. Let me let me fix that. No, they did not
[3144.96 --> 3150.56]  Shoot someone patch the hole. They stood by while someone else got shot a little bit of disinfectant
[3150.56 --> 3155.04]  They stood by they stand by they shot this gun. No, they didn't. Yes, they did
[3155.04 --> 3158.88]  Well, they didn't they didn't okay. Let's hold on. Let's try someone punch them in the face
[3158.88 --> 3163.04]  We need a they shot some other dude. No, so they're like crap. Okay, that's actually the bad guy
[3163.04 --> 3165.84]  Let me patch this someone else robbed their bank
[3166.64 --> 3169.92]  Okay, okay, so they so someone else no no someone else
[3170.40 --> 3175.84]  Robbed their bank, so they went and stole stuff from everyone that's every no no someone okay robin hood
[3175.84 --> 3182.24]  Let's say let's say robin hood okay like dirty robin hood who's in it for the profit to himself
[3182.24 --> 3185.60]  So definitely not robin hood not robin. So a thief
[3186.16 --> 3189.28]  Yes, okay, so we're gonna call him dirty robin
[3189.92 --> 3191.20]  Okay, so okay
[3191.20 --> 3194.72]  Dirty robin busts into the bank. Yep takes
[3195.68 --> 3201.68]  Money, okay, yeah, but but not like not just like us cash. Let's say this happens in america
[3201.68 --> 3208.08]  Okay, but they don't take us cash. They take all the foreign currency. Okay that for some reason people want
[3208.72 --> 3210.80]  No, let's say it happens in canada. Okay, just
[3212.40 --> 3213.28]  Can you just
[3213.28 --> 3220.00]  I'm going let's go. Okay. Okay, so they break into a canadian bank. No one wants canadian currency because it's plummeting right now
[3220.24 --> 3222.80]  So they take all the us currency
[3223.20 --> 3228.96]  Okay, and then instead of distributing it to the poor they sell it to the poor
[3228.96 --> 3235.76]  For canadian currency that they then convert to something useful like bitcoin
[3236.40 --> 3241.76]  And then they have money i'm i'm well relatively useful it got a little weird at the end. Okay, okay
[3241.76 --> 3243.76]  Okay, so so that's what happened
[3243.76 --> 3250.08]  Yeah, the ubisoft the the bank the bank. Thank you the ubisoft bank
[3250.72 --> 3252.24]  basically
[3252.24 --> 3254.72]  They validated the foreign currency
[3255.28 --> 3257.68]  Serial numbers that were stolen
[3258.32 --> 3263.04]  Because it was stolen goods. So they stole a stolen property. It is illegal to buy stolen goods
[3263.68 --> 3271.20]  But they bought it from a legitimate store. So we missed we screwed up part of that story. Okay, so but well they just stole the money from a legitimate bank
[3271.20 --> 3273.20]  I
[3276.48 --> 3285.36]  Was commenting on that at all I was to say we missed the part where like they they sold it to a store that you would normally buy legitimate things from
[3286.00 --> 3288.64]  So thank you that bought it. No, no, no
[3289.36 --> 3292.32]  Uh, people that stole from the bank a bank with a store in it. Oh
[3293.04 --> 3298.32]  Oh, I see what you're saying because they're not buying the money. Yeah, no, you said they sold the money. Yeah, they sold well
[3298.32 --> 3300.24]  They exchanged the but exchange the money
[3301.12 --> 3302.40]  So they were a bank okay
[3302.40 --> 3307.52]  So a bank stole money from a bank and then sold it to other banks and then people bought it from the yeah
[3307.52 --> 3309.76]  And then they canceled the bank money
[3310.80 --> 3312.80]  Okay, you know
[3312.80 --> 3314.80]  So basically ubisoft is
[3314.80 --> 3318.80]  Reactivating far cry for keys that were invalidated due to
[3321.76 --> 3324.88]  Okay, you know what why don't you just do this because apparently I can't handle it. Okay
[3326.40 --> 3331.36]  I'm so lost now. I actually had like the I had everything for the story ready and now i'm just screwed
[3331.76 --> 3332.64]  um
[3332.64 --> 3334.64]  Essentially, there's a whole bunch of keys
[3334.64 --> 3341.20]  uh stolen through apparently g2 or a whole bunch of keys were sold through g2a which were stolen or something
[3341.20 --> 3348.00]  From other online retailers or whatever, so ubisoft just went blah and like canceled everyone who had bought it from other retailers
[3348.48 --> 3352.96]  Um, although I don't think that's actually a proper general statement. It's said in the article that way
[3353.28 --> 3355.60]  But i'm pretty sure steam ones weren't canceled
[3356.32 --> 3358.72]  And that's technically not you play
[3359.68 --> 3360.80]  Right, okay
[3361.36 --> 3363.44]  So I don't really can you even buy far? I remember
[3364.96 --> 3368.56]  Didn't we buy far cry 4 through steam? We did yeah, we did yeah, but then I don't even remember
[3368.56 --> 3372.48]  There's something weird going with you play in far cry 4. I don't remember how all that stuff went down
[3372.48 --> 3375.28]  But anyways, a lot of keys got invalidated
[3375.60 --> 3378.88]  Because uh, they were stolen or they assumed to be stolen or whatever
[3379.12 --> 3383.52]  Even if they were purchased from sites that would traditionally have been seen as a legitimate way to buy things
[3384.08 --> 3384.72]  um
[3384.72 --> 3389.04]  And g2a has I think some form of protection or something
[3389.04 --> 3393.04]  So people that got that or no matter what being taken care of people that didn't are like
[3393.44 --> 3395.76]  Probably being taken care of and right
[3395.76 --> 3399.76]  I don't know their angle is super weird, but yeah, then ubisoft went like okay
[3401.04 --> 3405.12]  I think we need to like invalidate the ones that we think are currently stolen
[3405.12 --> 3409.68]  But not necessarily activated and let people play that actually paid for it at some point
[3410.48 --> 3411.68]  Okay, yeah, okay
[3412.24 --> 3415.36]  So they're like kind of trying to they're kind of trying to fix it here
[3415.36 --> 3419.60]  So ubisoft got screwed over actually yeah pretty hard and then they retaliated
[3419.60 --> 3425.68]  They did heavier than they probably should have in terms of saving face right so dirty robin took their stuff
[3426.32 --> 3430.16]  And then they basically strung up everyone he sold it to from it
[3430.16 --> 3432.24]  They did like the superhero recovery mode
[3432.24 --> 3435.44]  Which is where like they destroy half the city while trying to get the villain right?
[3435.92 --> 3436.32]  Yes
[3436.88 --> 3440.64]  Okay, speaking of which we had this conversation the other night
[3440.88 --> 3443.20]  I am like so excited for incredibles 2
[3443.20 --> 3449.36]  I know it's like not even close and there aren't even like teaser trailers yet, but there's nothing we can show you
[3449.36 --> 3451.36]  This is not an article. Yeah, this is not
[3451.36 --> 3452.32]  This is not a thing
[3452.32 --> 3454.32]  I just should be really good talking about the other night
[3454.80 --> 3460.48]  Speaking of things we were talking about the other night. We actually have some sponsors for the show today. Look at that lynda.com
[3461.36 --> 3464.24]  You can learn it. We've actually know what's really sexy
[3465.68 --> 3466.80]  uh
[3466.80 --> 3468.80]  intelligence intel yes
[3468.80 --> 3471.36]  That is a great point so
[3472.00 --> 3478.08]  lynda.com increase your sex appeal and only actually it doesn't even take it like any period of time because
[3478.08 --> 3482.40]  You can start learning on lynda.com within like minutes you go to lynda.com
[3482.88 --> 3489.04]  Wanshow for a free 10-day trial and then once you've had your 10 days of unlimited free knowledge
[3489.04 --> 3492.08]  Well, I shouldn't say unlimited because there's 24 hours per day
[3492.08 --> 3498.72]  So you get 240 hours maximum of time to watch video content unlimited within the realm of your like internet
[3498.80 --> 3500.80]  Buffering speed so
[3501.36 --> 3504.56]  Yeah, the I'm unlimited within
[3505.12 --> 3510.16]  Constraints we're giving a better term of unlimited than isps and cell providers do yeah
[3510.16 --> 3515.92]  I think we're being pretty fair about it at least it's unlimited in the amount of time that exists. Yeah, so
[3516.48 --> 3522.08]  So unlimited access to lynda.com for 10 days. You can learn all kinds of great stuff like coding digital photography
[3522.08 --> 3527.04]  uh business which uh, we've had quite a few people suggesting that perhaps we
[3527.68 --> 3534.56]  Take some courses on in the twitch chat here while we were discussing dirty robin and whatever else is we were talking about
[3534.56 --> 3537.84]  So guys, uh, thanks to lynda.com for sponsoring the wanshow
[3538.24 --> 3541.44]  We've also got square space as a sponsor this week
[3541.44 --> 3542.40]  So space
[3542.40 --> 3548.72]  I why do you have to bring up that song every time because I didn't know a single lyric when we sang it
[3548.72 --> 3555.12]  I know you didn't you didn't do your pre-show prep and now you're rubbing that in my face like I did something
[3555.92 --> 3564.24]  So, um guys if you if you missed it, you can check out square spaces super bowl commercial that we actually previewed last week with the jeff bridges
[3564.64 --> 3566.24]  Whole jeff bridges
[3566.24 --> 3569.68]  That project that he's working on with the sound recording, but that is
[3570.24 --> 3576.88]  Really not the point of square space. They've got a new slogan build it beautiful. I think that actually is not a bad slogan
[3576.88 --> 3579.44]  It's certainly better than the slogans. We were working on earlier
[3580.16 --> 3584.16]  We came up with some pretty bad ones. Did I show you the one that I liked though? Um
[3585.20 --> 3586.64]  Oh, oh, it was a
[3587.20 --> 3590.88]  We tech things seriously. Yeah, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like that one. Yeah
[3590.96 --> 3594.24]  That I thought that one was pretty funny. We have some other like really terrible punny stuff
[3594.64 --> 3597.04]  Uh anyway, so build it beautiful that is
[3597.76 --> 3602.00]  Kind of the point square space wants the web to be beautiful. They want it to be easy
[3602.00 --> 3608.56]  So with their website builder all you basically do is you sign up and you can get a trial at squarespace.com slash linus
[3608.56 --> 3612.80]  You get two weeks for free so you sign up you pick a template and it's like, okay
[3612.80 --> 3617.84]  You know, I want a store or I want a blog or I want a portfolio or business personal
[3618.08 --> 3619.68]  Whatever else the case may be
[3619.68 --> 3622.24]  Uh, it's very affordable. It starts at about eight bucks a month
[3622.48 --> 3624.48]  And then if you sign up for a year
[3624.80 --> 3630.72]  Then you can get your url thrown in for free and then if you use our code, then you get 10% off
[3630.72 --> 3634.40]  So it's like actually less than that
[3635.44 --> 3636.64]  Hooray! Hooray!
[3636.64 --> 3641.76]  Um, so basically you sign up and you follow all the little like steps you put it together
[3642.32 --> 3645.12]  Are you done yours yet? Can you show it yet? Not done. I won't be done for a little while
[3645.12 --> 3651.44]  Oh, I had like I've been saving this I had like the best the best square space here we go
[3651.92 --> 3653.92]  Um, nope, nope. Oh
[3654.64 --> 3657.28]  No, where is it? It might be in my other email account
[3657.28 --> 3664.40]  Uh, shoot, I feel terrible because I got like the best user testimonial for square space ever
[3664.96 --> 3668.72]  And they were like, oh my gosh, I use square space and it's like super awesome
[3669.52 --> 3671.52]  But they were a lot more eloquent than that
[3671.52 --> 3672.40]  Spreepy!
[3672.40 --> 3673.20]  Uh, do do do do
[3673.20 --> 3674.24]  It's a beautiful website
[3675.04 --> 3676.88]  It's super easy with our templates
[3676.88 --> 3679.68]  Okay, well it is the site's I'll have to find that again
[3679.68 --> 3681.12]  So the sites look great on mobile
[3681.12 --> 3686.08]  They look great on desktop and they're very responsive and easy to make easy to use
[3686.08 --> 3689.76]  They got 24 7 tech support and I think that pretty much covers it
[3689.76 --> 3696.80]  You want your site to look great and be very usable and be easy to make then squarespace.com is pretty much the way to go
[3697.44 --> 3700.00]  And then our last one is just kind of a just kind of a fun one
[3700.00 --> 3703.04]  We actually have a variety of different things from mass drop
[3703.52 --> 3707.04]  Um that we can show you guys today. We've had a lot of people
[3707.04 --> 3712.56]  Yeah, ruling over this keycap set when uh, what video did I show it in?
[3712.56 --> 3715.60]  I don't know. I think it was in the iMac gaming video
[3716.48 --> 3721.60]  iMac gaming no one's looking at the iMac no one's impressed on running crisis 3 on it
[3721.92 --> 3724.80]  Everyone's looking at this keycap set. That's what I was looking at
[3724.80 --> 3729.20]  So this was like a crazy I think this drop is actually over so I'm sorry guys
[3729.60 --> 3732.72]  I'm just like showing you cool stuff mass drop has that you can't buy
[3732.72 --> 3738.32]  But it's a full pbt keycap set with like custom star track themed spacey
[3738.88 --> 3742.24]  lettering like airlock key and like phase key
[3742.88 --> 3743.44]  Rescan
[3744.32 --> 3746.08]  Phase clan key
[3746.08 --> 3751.52]  Oh, so it's mostly designed for people who already know what the keys are supposed to be
[3751.52 --> 3754.00]  We should get super affordable though. We should get
[3754.64 --> 3757.76]  Nick van burkle a keyboard that has a phase clan key on it
[3757.76 --> 3761.20]  Then every single time that he presses it it just plays the audio clip
[3761.20 --> 3765.36]  We should probably do that actually that would be a good super fun just like how to do it
[3765.76 --> 3768.32]  Yeah, like if we just make like a phase clan button
[3769.12 --> 3770.56]  Yeah, that's actually totally doable
[3770.56 --> 3771.84]  I could do that with the Mickey Mickey
[3771.84 --> 3772.72]  We should totally make that
[3772.72 --> 3774.72]  That drop is on until tomorrow
[3774.72 --> 3775.20]  Oh
[3775.20 --> 3777.36]  That's what our link goes to is the keycap set
[3777.84 --> 3778.88]  All right, thank you nick
[3778.88 --> 3780.32]  So, bro.ps slash manchot
[3780.32 --> 3782.16]  Once again, I have no idea what's going on
[3782.40 --> 3783.36]  I do have two drops
[3783.36 --> 3784.56]  We're not done so you might as well just stay
[3784.56 --> 3785.68]  He does have notes on
[3785.68 --> 3787.92]  I just want to make it clear he does have notes on his screen
[3787.92 --> 3788.64]  He just doesn't look at them
[3788.64 --> 3790.32]  They're actually not technically on his screen right now
[3790.32 --> 3794.72]  Yeah, he's like he he not only moved the screen away, but he put a different window in front of it
[3795.52 --> 3798.32]  So there's like two layers of defense from the knowledge
[3798.32 --> 3801.44]  Okay, well they have other cool things that are over
[3801.76 --> 3804.32]  But the point is they have lots of stuff that isn't just keyboards
[3804.32 --> 3805.92]  So this is the uh
[3805.92 --> 3806.40]  Graffiti
[3806.40 --> 3807.60]  Graffiti lichen
[3807.60 --> 3808.24]  Yeah
[3808.24 --> 3813.52]  Something yeah anyway, so it's a little tiny USB charging cable
[3813.52 --> 3814.64]  They've got a lightning one
[3814.64 --> 3816.00]  They've got a micro USB one
[3816.00 --> 3820.40]  We've actually featured a very similar product before on Handy Tech Under 100
[3820.40 --> 3823.44]  Um, so they've got like cool little stuff like that
[3823.44 --> 3826.88]  And this I wasn't really sure about even bringing up on the show
[3826.88 --> 3830.00]  We don't generally talk about weapons on the land show
[3830.00 --> 3831.04]  It's not a weapon
[3832.80 --> 3833.20]  Okay
[3833.20 --> 3836.08]  A gun is not a weapon
[3836.08 --> 3837.28]  You call it a firearm
[3839.68 --> 3840.00]  Okay
[3840.00 --> 3842.08]  I'm serious if you go get your gun licensing
[3842.64 --> 3842.72]  Yeah
[3842.72 --> 3845.92]  In BC you call it a firearm or they will not give you your license
[3846.56 --> 3846.88]  So
[3846.88 --> 3847.44]  It's a firearm
[3847.44 --> 3849.92]  The fact that I called this a weapon means I shouldn't have a knife
[3850.64 --> 3850.88]  Yes
[3851.60 --> 3851.92]  My
[3851.92 --> 3857.44]  You can use it technically as a weapon but you don't describe it as a weapon
[3857.44 --> 3857.76]  Right
[3857.76 --> 3859.36]  And you don't use it as a weapon
[3859.92 --> 3860.72]  It just can be
[3860.72 --> 3862.72]  You can use a kitchen pot as a weapon
[3862.72 --> 3865.04]  It is actually done in very many times in movies
[3865.92 --> 3867.44]  You can use basically anything as a weapon
[3867.44 --> 3868.40]  You're gonna you're gonna you're gonna
[3868.40 --> 3869.60]  You're gonna hold on a second
[3869.60 --> 3874.72]  I could use your BS logic is gonna be it happens in movies therefore
[3875.36 --> 3875.92]  You can hit
[3875.92 --> 3876.24]  No
[3876.24 --> 3877.20]  You can't start a sentence with that
[3877.20 --> 3879.04]  You can hit someone with a frying pan and that would hurt a lot
[3879.04 --> 3880.08]  I can't take you seriously
[3880.08 --> 3881.36]  Do you want to fight me with a frying pan?
[3881.36 --> 3883.36]  No I don't want to fight you with a frying pan
[3884.32 --> 3886.32]  That is not the point that we're talking about at all
[3886.32 --> 3887.04]  The point is
[3887.68 --> 3888.72]  Draw.ps
[3888.72 --> 3889.60]  Slash
[3889.60 --> 3890.16]  WAN show
[3890.64 --> 3892.64]  For awesome drops like this one
[3892.96 --> 3895.68]  Bring it back around to the topic at hand
[3897.28 --> 3899.60]  Why do I even let you co-host this show with me?
[3900.56 --> 3903.04]  A frying pan could be very easily used as a weapon
[3903.04 --> 3903.60]  That would hurt
[3903.60 --> 3905.60]  I didn't say it couldn't be used as a weapon
[3905.60 --> 3908.56]  I just said the fact that it appears in movies is a
[3908.56 --> 3909.84]  A complete logical misstep
[3909.84 --> 3912.80]  No I said I said it could be and then I said in fact it is
[3913.68 --> 3914.88]  As an additional point
[3915.52 --> 3916.64]  Not as a main point
[3917.52 --> 3919.12]  That was a supporting article
[3921.12 --> 3922.24]  Supports nothing
[3923.36 --> 3924.00]  Speaking of
[3924.00 --> 3927.52]  My thesis on on on weapon variability
[3927.52 --> 3929.36]  Speaking of supporting nothing
[3929.36 --> 3932.72]  Uh consoles may get 4k support
[3933.04 --> 3933.84]  Uh sometime in Q4
[3933.84 --> 3935.12]  Okay this is good
[3935.12 --> 3935.68]  Can you post this?
[3935.68 --> 3936.80]  This is actually really helpful
[3937.28 --> 3937.92]  And my
[3937.92 --> 3939.52]  Could you actually do your job and post this?
[3939.52 --> 3941.20]  In the twitch chat
[3942.24 --> 3947.36]  The reason why this is really helpful is this might bring more uh 4k content
[3948.00 --> 3952.16]  Like Netflix and stuff might push for more 4k content because of compatibility on other things
[3952.16 --> 3957.12]  So non console people might actually get more 4k content than they can watch
[3957.76 --> 3958.72]  Um through that
[3958.72 --> 3961.20]  Thanks to playstation 4 and xbox one
[3961.68 --> 3964.08]  Um finally joining four years ago
[3964.72 --> 3966.16]  Well okay
[3966.16 --> 3966.96]  Well okay
[3966.96 --> 3969.44]  You could play 4k video easily for quite a while on a pc
[3969.44 --> 3971.28]  In terms of the hardware
[3971.28 --> 3976.40]  But then the fps4 and the xbox one already have the horsepower to play back 4k video
[3976.40 --> 3977.68]  It's not friggin complicated
[3977.68 --> 3978.08]  Yeah
[3978.08 --> 3984.56]  Um the problem is that they don't have a display interface that's capable of playing back 4k video
[3984.56 --> 3986.88]  And we haven't had that on the pc for that long
[3986.88 --> 3987.76]  It has been a couple years
[3987.76 --> 3988.32]  That's a good point
[3988.32 --> 3991.20]  But display port 1.2 is when we got that on the pc
[3991.20 --> 3994.56]  Like affordably without you know multi multi-linking
[3995.04 --> 3995.44]  Yeah
[3995.44 --> 3998.88]  Or like two monitors and bizzle chopping or whatever
[3998.88 --> 3999.04]  Yeah
[3999.04 --> 4003.28]  So what it seems like they were waiting for was HDMI 2.0
[4003.28 --> 4010.00]  And I suspect since it's already I mean it it hopefully the article covers this
[4010.64 --> 4012.80]  Um I don't remember anymore
[4012.80 --> 4017.20]  But I don't think we're going to be looking at 4k gaming anytime soon
[4017.20 --> 4019.52]  Because that would be a serious hardware revision
[4019.52 --> 4020.16]  As I told Nick
[4020.16 --> 4020.88]  Hardware revision
[4021.44 --> 4022.00]  It could
[4022.64 --> 4023.04]  It could
[4023.04 --> 4024.00]  It would just have to do 4k like
[4024.00 --> 4024.56]  You'd be playing puzzle bobble
[4024.56 --> 4026.40]  Yeah the arcade games or whatever
[4026.40 --> 4028.32]  Like it would you're not going to do yeah
[4029.12 --> 4031.36]  You might do arcade gaming stuff that's about it
[4031.36 --> 4033.92]  So like 4k stick man adventures
[4033.92 --> 4034.48]  Stick man adventures
[4034.48 --> 4035.44]  2015 edition
[4035.44 --> 4036.48]  Uh
[4036.48 --> 4037.20]  Um
[4037.20 --> 4040.48]  Maybe tetris unless they put too many cool graphics in
[4040.48 --> 4041.44]  They've done that sometimes
[4042.48 --> 4044.00]  But then now that I think about it
[4044.00 --> 4046.00]  No they already have HDMI 1.4
[4046.00 --> 4049.44]  They could technically do HDMI video playback already
[4051.52 --> 4052.80]  At 30 fps
[4052.80 --> 4056.48]  This actually got said as to no longer be an official statement anyways
[4056.48 --> 4056.72]  So
[4057.92 --> 4058.88]  So moving on
[4058.88 --> 4060.48]  Because netflix is the one that said it
[4060.48 --> 4061.44]  And then they're like oh wait
[4061.44 --> 4063.52]  We can't talk on behalf of those guys
[4063.52 --> 4064.48]  So yeah
[4067.76 --> 4068.40]  That's about it
[4068.96 --> 4070.16]  Three months later
[4070.16 --> 4072.00]  Android 5.0 lollipop
[4072.00 --> 4073.84]  Uh the last one was posted by
[4073.84 --> 4076.24]  Creator and this one's posted by goodbytes
[4076.24 --> 4079.76]  Has only 1.6 percent market share
[4081.52 --> 4082.88]  Wowee
[4082.88 --> 4085.12]  That is uh not a whole heck of a lot
[4085.12 --> 4089.36]  Um especially given that android operating systems come in at the
[4089.92 --> 4092.56]  Whopping price of absolutely nothing
[4092.56 --> 4093.12]  Yeah
[4093.12 --> 4095.12]  Uh to run on anything
[4095.12 --> 4097.60]  So this means this means a couple of things
[4097.60 --> 4099.68]  Um it or it could mean a couple of things
[4099.68 --> 4100.32]  Um it could mean a couple of things
[4100.32 --> 4102.80]  Number one it could mean that kitkat was just fine
[4103.44 --> 4108.80]  Um and handset makers and or users simply don't feel the need to update
[4108.80 --> 4117.28]  Uh number two is it could mean that the devices that come preloaded with lollipop like the nexus 6 uh nvidia shield tablet nexus 9
[4117.68 --> 4120.16]  Um um just aren't selling that well
[4120.16 --> 4125.84]  But I really don't think that's it because the android install base is so massive
[4126.40 --> 4130.32]  I mean to put it in the appropriate context jellybean is still in the lead
[4130.32 --> 4130.56]  Yeah
[4130.56 --> 4133.92]  And there have been some pretty successful kitkat based devices
[4134.32 --> 4136.40]  Um so I don't think that's it
[4136.40 --> 4140.64]  And then number three and this is the one that I personally think is most likely
[4140.64 --> 4146.96]  The handset makers that are validating lollipop are finding it just kind of a bear to deal with and roll out to their devices
[4146.96 --> 4152.40]  Um droid turbo was sold with the promise of quick update to lollipop
[4152.40 --> 4155.12]  I mean we're three months in that's not exactly quick these days
[4155.12 --> 4156.16]  Um
[4156.16 --> 4158.48]  So so there you go
[4158.48 --> 4163.68]  I mean I personally wasn't that impressed with lollipop but google has acknowledged the memory leak issue
[4163.68 --> 4164.72]  Um
[4166.16 --> 4171.20]  That they're hopefully going to be fixing and I think it was going to be a 5.1 update of the people that I know that have
[4171.68 --> 4172.00]  uh
[4172.00 --> 4172.80]  lollipop it
[4173.44 --> 4176.56]  I haven't actually heard usually when there's a new phone os
[4177.20 --> 4182.32]  You're like oh there's all these cool new things about it like look at this new thing I can do blah blah blah blah blah
[4182.96 --> 4183.92]  No
[4183.92 --> 4188.56]  Nothing really I hear some frustrations about like how notifications work and how you have to scroll through them and stuff
[4188.56 --> 4194.64]  And that's about it just some frustration and some extra clicks um all for the sake of material design
[4194.96 --> 4199.04]  Yeah, that's that's about all I've heard is I have to do more things to be able to get stuff done
[4199.52 --> 4203.28]  The thing that really annoyed me most and maybe this is petty because brandon doesn't seem to care
[4203.28 --> 4205.20]  He's running a nexus 5 with lollipop. Um
[4205.76 --> 4209.28]  Is removing the dividing lines between all the characters on the keyboard?
[4209.28 --> 4210.96]  Yeah, why do you need to do that?
[4210.96 --> 4215.04]  Yeah, don't why don't you have uh better things to do?
[4215.04 --> 4216.00]  Swiftkey?
[4216.00 --> 4220.40]  Um, oh, yeah, yeah, but whenever I whenever I fire up a new phone fresh install
[4220.64 --> 4226.40]  I try to use it until it makes me mad and then that's my benchmark for whether it was good enough
[4227.60 --> 4233.36]  So so if I have to if I end up switching to swiftkey, it's like how long did it take me to switch to swiftkey?
[4233.36 --> 4235.36]  That's how good their stock keyboard is
[4235.76 --> 4241.44]  Well, their stock keyboard is about a two and a half week. Yeah, it's a two it's a two and a half week until it frustrates you
[4241.44 --> 4248.00]  Started start giving it like its own value. Yvonne recently switched to the one in eight and it was a one-day keyboard for her
[4248.72 --> 4251.36]  The uh the the sense sense keyboard
[4252.80 --> 4258.00]  She was like this is terrible because she'd been using the iphone before and uh, I was like no no, it's okay
[4258.00 --> 4261.04]  I can change it. She's like no, it's okay. I'm like no, no, I'll change it for you
[4261.04 --> 4267.44]  So I put in swiftkey, I put in the number row, I removed swipe, and then I changed the delay for um
[4267.44 --> 4271.52]  Yeah, for special characters. I do every single one of those are my essential
[4272.40 --> 4276.00]  Essential settings for swiftkey and she was like, oh, this is great. Yeah, this is much better. Yeah
[4276.40 --> 4277.36]  um
[4277.36 --> 4282.16]  Dual gpu cards and configurations. This is posted by assassin
[4282.56 --> 4287.44]  And we are of course going to use the wccf tech link because we love trolling you guys
[4288.00 --> 4288.96]  um mate
[4288.96 --> 4289.92]  oh
[4289.92 --> 4290.72]  really
[4290.72 --> 4292.72]  wrecked
[4293.36 --> 4294.56]  Rekt, wrecked, wrecked
[4294.56 --> 4295.36]  That is annoying
[4296.16 --> 4302.08]  It's probably a loose connection somewhere. I blame you. You set it up. All right, I'll try not to add the wrong camera this time
[4302.08 --> 4306.64]  I blame your feet. I blame your on the table. I blame your face. You're probably bumping things
[4307.68 --> 4309.44]  What is going on here? Well, whatever
[4309.84 --> 4310.40]  um
[4310.40 --> 4312.24]  We should just like glue in all the connections
[4312.24 --> 4314.40]  So new low-level apis like
[4315.04 --> 4320.72]  Mantle and DirectX 12 may allow game developers to combine
[4321.36 --> 4328.00]  The video memory of multiple graphics cards. So the autobahn hammer that 24 gig
[4329.12 --> 4336.00]  System that we built with three 290x 8 gig cards could potentially have 24 gigs of video memory now to be clear
[4337.28 --> 4339.92]  This is at least in the short term
[4340.56 --> 4348.24]  Completely purposeless because no game developer is going to build a game that is going to take advantage of 24 games
[4348.24 --> 4350.00]  Not even just that I'm going to quote a
[4351.04 --> 4353.44]  A little bit long quote here, but still quote
[4353.68 --> 4359.92]  Just because they're running windows 10 and dx 12 and or mantle api does not mean that your multi gpu configuration
[4360.32 --> 4364.72]  Is now stacking memory the capability is present in these low-level overhead apis
[4364.72 --> 4370.32]  But they will not come into effect until devs specifically optimize the games as such
[4371.76 --> 4376.24]  Right, so not only is there no games that can really use that much vram right now
[4376.80 --> 4383.20]  But the devs are gonna have to do it themselves and looking at how long it takes them to even have multi gpu profiles
[4383.84 --> 4390.00]  At launch half the freaking time. I don't see that many devs really doing this at least not now
[4391.76 --> 4391.92]  So
[4393.04 --> 4395.04]  Don't get your hopes up
[4395.60 --> 4402.16]  Sponsored titles. I mean this is not just a pc feature. This is like a super esoteric pc feature
[4402.16 --> 4408.88]  Yeah, that a very small subset of that pc audience is going to be able to leverage so yeah, so that's cool
[4409.76 --> 4411.60]  And that's I'm very happy that it exists
[4412.16 --> 4414.88]  One thing that's very cool about this is that
[4415.68 --> 4418.88]  Well, it's mantle so it'll probably come to like everything else as well
[4419.12 --> 4426.72]  And if it starts being available in kind of everything and then hopefully starts being available as just a plug-in that developers can do instead of
[4426.72 --> 4427.28]  uh
[4427.28 --> 4429.28]  Having to manually code things for that
[4430.56 --> 4437.12]  Then that would be nice so not now but future speaking of speaking of mantle and direct x12
[4437.12 --> 4441.44]  This is actually an article. I was reading oh for crying out loud right. I don't have screen share
[4442.00 --> 4443.60]  uh, okay
[4443.60 --> 4445.60]  Sorry, this is a linkable thing. I
[4446.16 --> 4448.16]  Just on a non-tech
[4448.32 --> 4454.72]  Oh, you're gonna do it there. Okay. Yeah, I'll just do it here. Um, I just want to share the article. That's all yeah, so I'll just add
[4455.52 --> 4457.52]  Screen region boopity boop
[4458.56 --> 4460.72]  Here's my browser enjoy. Okay
[4463.12 --> 4470.08]  There we go, uh, the direct x12 performance preview amd nvidia and star swarm so ryan smith over at an on tech
[4470.48 --> 4476.24]  Put together some explanations of blippity bloop. You can read all that if you want. Here's the star swarm
[4476.88 --> 4478.88]  Demo and the test and
[4479.36 --> 4483.12]  Here are the results so on cards that support direct x11
[4484.24 --> 4485.92]  12 and mantle
[4486.24 --> 4493.04]  We get to see all three results and for cards that don't support mantle nvidia cards, uh, we get to see direct x11 and 12. So
[4493.60 --> 4494.16]  uh
[4494.16 --> 4500.08]  gtx 980 gets more than a doubling in performance moving from direct x11 to direct x12
[4500.40 --> 4505.84]  And we've also got on the amd cards direct x12 and mantle performing within spitting distance of each other
[4506.32 --> 4511.52]  Pretty well across the board mental winning in every case, but definitely within spitting distance. Yeah
[4512.88 --> 4516.08]  Yes, mantle does does edge out direct x12 in every case
[4516.48 --> 4521.84]  But I think that if people were hoping that mantle was going to be the reason to own an amd card
[4522.32 --> 4523.12]  um, they're
[4524.24 --> 4525.12]  I think well
[4525.12 --> 4526.96]  basically if they work at amd
[4527.52 --> 4531.84]  Then I think they're going to be a little bit disappointed because the thing is is that star swarm
[4532.48 --> 4535.52]  Is kind of a a worst case scenario?
[4535.52 --> 4544.00]  It is designed to showcase scenarios where there are far too many draw calls for direct x11 to be able to handle it efficiently
[4544.56 --> 4545.52]  and
[4545.52 --> 4548.64]  To create cpu bottlenecks. It's designed to do that
[4549.12 --> 4555.12]  Whereas real games these differences that you see between mantle and direct x11
[4555.76 --> 4560.96]  We've already seen that in real games. You're not looking at a doubling of performance from from direct x11 to mantle
[4560.96 --> 4563.28]  You're looking at maybe a couple of percent a few percent. Yeah
[4563.60 --> 4566.88]  Um, so that difference between mantle and direct x12
[4567.52 --> 4569.60]  will be a fraction of a fraction
[4569.60 --> 4573.12]  Of that other bigger difference that ends up being much smaller. Yeah, so
[4573.68 --> 4578.08]  And then if we do end up doing that which we probably will eventually end up using all that performance
[4578.64 --> 4578.96]  um
[4578.96 --> 4581.52]  Direct x12 will have well
[4581.52 --> 4583.60]  We might not even be on direct x12 at that point
[4583.60 --> 4587.92]  We might be further on but that gap probably will have closed at least a little bit anyways
[4589.12 --> 4589.44]  Yes
[4590.64 --> 4594.96]  But yeah, it's it's a little bit disappointing that it has to be has to lean so much on developers
[4594.96 --> 4601.84]  We're seeing so many things come out these days where uh, to quote balmer developers developers developers
[4601.84 --> 4609.20]  Eye tracking leans on developers vr leans on developers this leans on developers so much stuff is doing that and it's uh
[4609.20 --> 4613.28]  Yeah, as a developer right now, I would be scared and excited at the same time
[4614.08 --> 4622.08]  All right, speaking of being scared and excited. This is posted by alex goes high razer has upgraded the blade with maxwell
[4622.08 --> 4627.04]  And more importantly for me since i'm a bit of a tab fiend more ram
[4627.52 --> 4629.92]  So the blade is now available with a gtx
[4630.56 --> 4632.80]  970m instead of an 870m and
[4633.36 --> 4639.04]  16 gigs of ram is now an option on the higher end skew you still have that same
[4640.00 --> 4641.20]  high resolution
[4641.20 --> 4643.44]  exo panel display luke is
[4644.48 --> 4647.20]  Doing things yeah, I got kind of a funny idea
[4647.52 --> 4650.32]  Uh, so which one is this this one?
[4651.04 --> 4652.24]  Oh, what the oh?
[4652.24 --> 4652.96]  What are you doing?
[4652.96 --> 4657.60]  I was gonna I was gonna give them like a behind the scenes of what you were doing well, I'm trying to
[4659.12 --> 4661.12]  Actually, I'm just gonna point it at your butt
[4662.16 --> 4664.16]  Why would I not do that?
[4664.96 --> 4668.24]  This doesn't seem like very high quality show content hello
[4669.84 --> 4676.16]  Let's look at my nose what you got going on down there well there's computer cables and carpet and video cables and video cables
[4676.16 --> 4680.88]  Oh look a wheel hey, a foot oh why don't you wear footwear at work?
[4682.08 --> 4684.16]  Because I don't want it right okay
[4684.16 --> 4686.08]  Why don't you have the air conditioning installed?
[4686.88 --> 4688.00]  Because it's expensive
[4688.88 --> 4690.08]  Footwear is expensive
[4690.08 --> 4692.24]  That's true footwear not the kind you would buy
[4692.24 --> 4694.56]  No, nothing you would buy is expensive
[4694.56 --> 4703.36]  No, okay, they upgraded the cpu from an i7 4702 hq to an i7 47 20 hq that movement of the two is actually very important
[4703.36 --> 4707.60]  That signifies a tdp jump from 37 to 47 watts
[4708.48 --> 4716.48]  Which the more efficient 970m allowed although personally I probably would have opted for more battery and
[4717.36 --> 4720.40]  Not bother with that minuscule gain in cpu performance
[4721.04 --> 4726.32]  There's also a new lower end version with a 1080p display and 256 gig ssd for two grand
[4726.96 --> 4727.92]  Still very expensive
[4728.96 --> 4730.96]  All right commenting on the crt
[4730.96 --> 4735.28]  Um, oh the crt yeah the crt is for uh retro games
[4737.60 --> 4742.08]  Next so I I guess here i'll post this one. I'll let you uh, I'll let you handle this one
[4742.40 --> 4743.84]  Or I guess we could both handle this one
[4743.84 --> 4750.40]  So the fcc will declare the internet title two and apply net neutrality rules to mobile
[4751.44 --> 4754.24]  That is awesome. So great news wheeler
[4754.96 --> 4759.68]  Did a bit of a jump face and started actually supporting the people that he's supposed to which is cool
[4760.16 --> 4761.52]  um and
[4761.52 --> 4765.12]  Started backing up saying like oh, yeah, well we we we've listened to
[4765.12 --> 4769.20]  Uh, the communities and the people and all this kind of stuff for once apparently
[4769.60 --> 4773.20]  Um, and now yeah title two and blah blah blah
[4773.52 --> 4778.80]  There's some kind of sketchy things in this i'm not going to go over too much over title two as we've covered that in previous episodes
[4779.36 --> 4783.92]  But uh, they want to modernize title two we were talking about this before the show
[4784.24 --> 4784.88]  Yeah, um
[4784.88 --> 4791.20]  I actually just kind of skimmed over it initially thought that modernized title two just kind of meant that they're going to modernize the
[4791.20 --> 4798.08]  infrastructure behind title two like the physical infrastructure behind title two apparently they might be uh
[4798.88 --> 4805.44]  Changing kind of how it works, but a lot of it should be in terms of uh, where's his exact wording for it
[4805.52 --> 4811.44]  Tailoring it for the 21st century in order to provide returns necessary to construct competitive networks
[4811.44 --> 4816.16]  So so so yeah, we're talking about the physical infrastructure
[4816.16 --> 4824.00]  And the rules of of title two altering to enable that to happen
[4824.56 --> 4829.92]  But if we if we were to take the optimistic approach to that statement and go
[4830.40 --> 4835.44]  Oh, it's to it's to prevent the kind of nonsense that's already been going on
[4836.00 --> 4838.72]  For the last decade with the internet, um
[4839.60 --> 4845.44]  Then then that that's great. I mean some of the other points here no rate regulation no tariffs
[4845.76 --> 4847.76]  No last mile unbundling
[4848.24 --> 4853.92]  Um, and this means the action we take will be strong enough and flexible enough not only to deal with the realities of today
[4853.92 --> 4859.84]  But also to establish ground rules for the as yet unimagined the internet must be fast far and open
[4859.84 --> 4864.48]  This is the message i've heard if we're to sort of believe all this then this is incredibly good news
[4864.48 --> 4868.32]  It seems like too much of an about face for it all to be positive
[4869.04 --> 4870.80]  I feel like there has to be something
[4870.80 --> 4875.76]  And i'm worried about that that could be my like pessimism coming out, but
[4877.52 --> 4882.16]  I mean the theory is that the fcc is supposed to be on the side of the consumer
[4882.16 --> 4884.56]  But they like haven't really shown that until now
[4885.84 --> 4887.84]  Which is sketchy
[4888.08 --> 4890.64]  Yeah, I uh, I just I just I mean I
[4891.52 --> 4897.60]  I gotta wonder where they was he keeping quiet just because he didn't want to shake the boat yet
[4897.60 --> 4899.12]  And this was the plan all along
[4899.60 --> 4903.76]  I mean, uh, he brings up, uh, I don't think this is in our notes, but it was in the article
[4903.76 --> 4908.08]  But he brings up a company that he used to work for that got uh
[4908.64 --> 4909.52]  control f
[4909.52 --> 4910.16]  Naboo
[4910.96 --> 4911.92]  Yeah
[4911.92 --> 4913.28]  It is in the notes
[4913.28 --> 4921.36]  Is it tells the story of naboo the home computer network a competitor to aol a startup that he was the president of that failed because networks acted as gatekeepers
[4922.24 --> 4928.00]  So, I mean, you know, was he was he on our side all this time? I I I don't know don't really think so
[4928.24 --> 4929.92]  But maybe didn't look that way. No
[4930.80 --> 4934.72]  Um, speaking of not being on our side. This was posted by powder banks
[4934.72 --> 4939.20]  That last one was from smitty she and the previous one was from alex goes high
[4939.76 --> 4945.52]  And then the previous one was from assassin, but we didn't do any for a bit. Um, china will require real name registration
[4946.48 --> 4950.48]  For use of the internet and we're not talking real name registration
[4950.48 --> 4953.68]  Like you have to pay for your internet service from your provider
[4954.00 --> 4957.04]  And you have to pay them with a credit card that has your name attached to it
[4957.28 --> 4963.44]  We're talking about the burden being put on isps and internet companies to enforce
[4964.00 --> 4971.28]  The new rules which are that the 650 million people who are online in china need to be personally identifiable
[4972.00 --> 4974.00]  online in their goings about
[4976.08 --> 4978.08]  Super dumb
[4978.08 --> 4979.12]  Now
[4979.12 --> 4984.64]  Can I play devil's advocate or are you just gonna get mad? Are you gonna get all mad? I know can you just stay calm for like two seconds?
[4984.64 --> 4989.36]  Thank you, you know, those are all things that just make people mad. I know when you say okay, um, so
[4989.36 --> 4993.04]  Okay, so the the devil's advocate sort of
[4993.44 --> 4993.92]  um
[4993.92 --> 4999.20]  Glass half full side of this is oh, it will reduce, you know, uh
[5000.00 --> 5007.44]  inappropriate internet behaviors like swatting or trolling or bullying or just just can you just I said
[5008.08 --> 5010.40]  Two seconds two seconds. I didn't get mad
[5011.28 --> 5013.84]  You I was watching you in the screen. I saw what you did
[5013.84 --> 5015.84]  Uh, so
[5015.84 --> 5017.44]  Let me take notes on this blast
[5017.44 --> 5024.48]  That being being identifiable online will lead to more personal accountability for one's actions
[5024.80 --> 5031.52]  When they go about their business online that is the that is the devil's advocate sort of version of that now
[5032.24 --> 5033.76]  What I actually?
[5033.76 --> 5036.80]  Personally think is that it's not going to help with that at all
[5036.80 --> 5038.80]  I mean there are sites and there are
[5038.80 --> 5043.52]  communities where they have tried to enforce people using their real names
[5044.56 --> 5046.56]  Didn't seem to help a whole lot with google plus
[5047.28 --> 5048.32]  um
[5048.56 --> 5053.92]  So so there's there's that but aside from aside from it not working
[5054.64 --> 5060.64]  The fact that there are communities that already have this that encourage the use of real names like facebook
[5060.96 --> 5066.24]  Means that if people wanted to engage in that way, then they would go to those sites and they would do it
[5066.24 --> 5074.88]  This way we're not giving people a choice and it feels less like a benevolent sort of nod to
[5075.36 --> 5082.16]  You know high school kids who are getting bullied and more of a way to keep tabs on what people are doing and what they're saying
[5082.16 --> 5085.12]  And in the context of of you know
[5085.52 --> 5088.64]  Someone's being a dick to me on twitter
[5089.20 --> 5089.84]  I guess yeah
[5089.84 --> 5094.32]  I would probably like to know who that person is so I can call their mom so that I can be like yo
[5094.32 --> 5099.44]  Do you have any idea what your little crap of turd of a son just said to me or daughter?
[5099.52 --> 5101.28]  Whatever, you know gender equality
[5101.52 --> 5102.32]  um
[5102.32 --> 5104.32]  Girls can be rude online, too
[5105.52 --> 5108.80]  So so that side of me is like yeah, this is great
[5109.20 --> 5117.44]  But the flip side is you know what if someone lives in a country where they're oppressed for their religion or their or anything else about them
[5117.44 --> 5121.20]  And they can't they can't find other people they can't find support that's
[5122.00 --> 5128.72]  That's a huge problem or if they need to speak out against their government online or get access to news sources that are not censored by their local government
[5128.72 --> 5131.92]  I mean having anonymity as you browse the web is incredibly important
[5132.48 --> 5133.12]  Can I talk now?
[5133.76 --> 5134.88]  All right get all mad
[5134.88 --> 5136.64]  I'm not no i'm not getting mad you said uh
[5137.60 --> 5142.32]  Because you you you devil's advocate and then you went back which is weird as a devil's advocate
[5142.32 --> 5148.56]  Well, I didn't say I was a good advocate you fought against yourself for way longer than you fought for devil's advocacy
[5148.96 --> 5151.76]  You were like here's some small points now. I'm gonna destroy myself
[5153.20 --> 5154.56]  Okay, sure
[5155.12 --> 5155.76]  um
[5156.00 --> 5159.60]  You said less swatting and less trolling. I think those are specifically
[5161.12 --> 5165.60]  Totally wrong. I think there'll be way more swatting because swatting is
[5166.32 --> 5172.16]  Anonymous for the person that's doing it unless it's not and if every internet user was identifiable on every site
[5172.16 --> 5173.68]  That they're using
[5173.68 --> 5175.44]  Right, you can pick up a phone
[5175.44 --> 5178.08]  But if you pick up a phone then that's tied to your landline
[5178.08 --> 5182.56]  I'm assuming any any regime regime that's requiring you to register online probably knows you
[5182.56 --> 5184.64]  There's always ways to file anonymous
[5184.88 --> 5186.00]  Yeah, that's true information
[5186.16 --> 5187.28]  Anonymous information
[5187.28 --> 5192.16]  And that's how like basically okay swatting bad example online bullying though perhaps online bullying
[5192.16 --> 5195.20]  Yes, but you're like bullying more bullying and more
[5195.68 --> 5200.48]  Trolling into the real world which is a lot worse than being bullied and trolled
[5200.48 --> 5203.44]  Not that we're saying online bullying isn't real and isn't a problem
[5203.44 --> 5208.08]  No, but saying i'm gonna punch you in the face and actually punching someone in the face
[5208.64 --> 5209.76]  Are very different things
[5210.32 --> 5213.36]  I would way rather someone goes i'm gonna punch you in the face
[5214.00 --> 5215.52]  on a keyboard and then
[5216.16 --> 5221.60]  Finish the game we're playing in and go on to other matchmaking instead of having them go kabam in real life
[5222.24 --> 5225.52]  Right and now obviously not every time that happens is it going to happen
[5225.52 --> 5228.24]  But when people can't vent their frustration in that way
[5228.80 --> 5230.64]  Uh, it might happen more in the real world
[5230.64 --> 5235.12]  This is actually something that's been happening in terms of uh studies with violent video games a lot
[5235.44 --> 5238.80]  Which is where a lot of people can use it as a venting mechanism instead of actually doing it
[5238.80 --> 5240.88]  It reduces violent crimes by a lot
[5241.52 --> 5246.40]  Where you can play like gta just do stupid crap and then go play golf afterwards in gta
[5246.80 --> 5247.36]  Um
[5247.36 --> 5253.36]  Is actually helping reduce a lot of the like violent crappy things you might do in real life because you can you can vent
[5253.68 --> 5257.60]  It's an interesting idea and if you're removing all of that that's actually not a good thing
[5257.68 --> 5259.68]  I'm not advocating for trolling on the internet
[5259.68 --> 5261.12]  I think trolling on the internet is stupid
[5261.20 --> 5267.20]  The amount of crap that happened on the forum over the 970 thing was ridiculous and like totally not okay
[5267.52 --> 5269.92]  And I lost a lot of respect for a lot of people on the forum
[5270.80 --> 5275.92]  But i'm happy that wasn't a whole bunch of people standing in a building fighting each other
[5275.92 --> 5278.40]  That would have been worse like
[5279.92 --> 5282.72]  I don't know this is fairly like straightforward stuff
[5283.04 --> 5287.52]  I don't know all right, so let's move on to something that's also fairly straightforward
[5287.52 --> 5290.96]  Uh, this was posted by nine shadow on the forum the samsung galaxy
[5291.92 --> 5300.32]  S6 chassis has been leaked allegedly uh, it looks like it's gonna have an all metal non-removable back
[5300.96 --> 5305.84]  Uh appears to look fairly similar to the iphone 6 i'd love to show it to you guys
[5306.56 --> 5308.56]  Actually galaxy
[5310.88 --> 5313.36]  S6 here we go
[5317.36 --> 5319.36]  Chassis leak
[5321.20 --> 5321.60]  Okay
[5324.32 --> 5326.88]  Okay, let's go come on forbes
[5327.76 --> 5329.12]  Continue to say here we go
[5329.12 --> 5335.44]  So here's the article from forbes where they're showing how very apple like the alleged galaxy
[5336.16 --> 5338.48]  S6 chassis is going to look
[5339.04 --> 5339.84]  That is very good
[5339.84 --> 5341.52]  They're gonna get the pantsuit off of them
[5342.32 --> 5344.72]  Yeah, that seems very possible
[5344.72 --> 5347.04]  So let's go ahead and tuck tuck that away for now
[5347.04 --> 5347.60]  Tuck tuck
[5347.60 --> 5348.24]  Yep
[5348.24 --> 5348.80]  Um
[5349.68 --> 5351.28]  I think there's a reference there that I missed
[5351.28 --> 5352.56]  A few people will get that
[5352.56 --> 5355.20]  So it's going to use glass material in the front and back
[5355.20 --> 5359.04]  Some of them are apparently going to have like curved curved screens
[5359.04 --> 5361.52]  Uh, like curved edge screens and some of them are not
[5361.52 --> 5366.24]  Um, samsung pay is said to be embedded in the phone good luck with that samsung
[5366.24 --> 5372.00]  Um might be uh based on magnetic emitting that mimics your credit card so not nfc
[5372.00 --> 5376.32]  Uh potentially accepted in 10 million points of sale without retooling existing machines
[5376.32 --> 5381.44]  I still wish them luck although apple pay is apparently only available in 200 000 spots for me
[5381.44 --> 5383.36]  It's more of a trust issue and less of a
[5384.00 --> 5388.56]  Um, like trusting the technology apple does a good job. No, I hear you. Yeah, um
[5388.56 --> 5392.56]  Apparently the rear will be non-removable
[5393.04 --> 5399.92]  So as much as the s5 was not a huge success for samsung and I think that's kind of putting it lightly
[5399.92 --> 5406.40]  I think that taking away the things that made the galaxy s the galaxy s
[5407.36 --> 5409.76]  um things like removable battery
[5410.56 --> 5411.60]  is probably
[5412.80 --> 5418.00]  Not like I I don't I don't see an iphone 6 clone being a way to win new customers
[5418.40 --> 5423.20]  And I don't see taking away the things that sold your phone to someone else a generation or two ago
[5423.44 --> 5429.20]  Being a way to retain your existing customers. So I really have to wonder what exactly is the plan here right now?
[5429.20 --> 5433.68]  Or if it's real or if it's even real. Yeah, could be totally fake. So there's that
[5434.24 --> 5439.92]  I I really wonder sometimes these things are freakishly accurate. So it could be right, but it's it's
[5440.48 --> 5445.12]  More often than not really close. Yes more often than not. Yep. This is really really close
[5445.28 --> 5446.88]  I have to clarify something
[5446.88 --> 5451.92]  I think a few people in the chat thought I meant that people attacking invidio on the forum was super bad
[5451.92 --> 5455.20]  I wasn't talking about that. I was talking about personal insults going to each other
[5455.20 --> 5458.56]  Yeah, we don't want members fighting. We don't care if people are upset with that
[5458.56 --> 5461.28]  That's like a rule on the forum. You're allowed to attack companies
[5463.52 --> 5468.32]  Bring back the shill sweater so you can attack linus on the forum for wearing a shill sweater
[5468.96 --> 5473.28]  Yeah, that's fine, but you can't attack linus for actually you can attack linus. I'm weird
[5473.28 --> 5476.96]  That's what I'm saying. We don't we don't count we are members, but we don't count
[5476.96 --> 5479.04]  You can attack us and you can attack companies
[5479.04 --> 5482.72]  But don't attack other members of the forum. That's not a thing if you disagree with what they're saying
[5483.44 --> 5486.64]  Use an intelligent argument to talk about how you disagree with what they're saying
[5486.64 --> 5488.24]  Or better yet don't reply
[5489.04 --> 5490.24]  No, because there can be a discussion
[5490.24 --> 5491.44]  Well first the intelligent argument
[5491.44 --> 5491.92]  Yeah
[5491.92 --> 5492.64]  Then don't reply
[5493.12 --> 5493.44]  Yeah
[5493.44 --> 5495.44]  If they seem to be stuck in their ways
[5495.44 --> 5495.76]  If they just troll
[5495.76 --> 5496.32]  Yeah
[5496.32 --> 5496.64]  Yeah
[5496.64 --> 5497.20]  Yeah
[5497.20 --> 5499.84]  Recognize when people are trolling you like this right now
[5501.12 --> 5501.36]  Yeah
[5502.64 --> 5504.00]  We do that at really good timing
[5504.00 --> 5504.72]  You owe me a coke
[5505.28 --> 5506.08]  I don't want a coke
[5506.08 --> 5508.80]  I think you already owed me a coke from our last text
[5508.80 --> 5509.28]  We just like
[5509.28 --> 5510.40]  Yeah, we'll call it even
[5510.40 --> 5510.96]  All right
[5510.96 --> 5512.80]  We can just buy each other nothing
[5512.80 --> 5514.56]  That works better for me
[5517.76 --> 5520.96]  All right, so the Nintendo creators program
[5521.52 --> 5525.12]  Which was already ridiculous. So you guys I mean if you've been following this whole
[5525.84 --> 5529.44]  Fiasco Nintendo was claiming monetization against
[5530.08 --> 5533.76]  Let's players and game streamers who were streaming their games
[5533.76 --> 5537.92]  You know based on that they're using the in-game music and artwork without
[5538.96 --> 5547.20]  Having created it themselves when the content creators the guys who are playing the games are arguing that it's actually their commentary that is the content
[5547.76 --> 5551.20]  And this is a fair use of bloopity bloopity bloop whatever
[5551.20 --> 5554.64]  Anyway, so Nintendo sort of about faced on that
[5555.20 --> 5562.88]  And created the Nintendo creators program that would allow creators to register as approved creators
[5562.88 --> 5564.64]  Um, and then they
[5566.16 --> 5569.12]  Started introducing that they want a share of the revenue
[5569.84 --> 5573.68]  So I believe it's a 60 40 split by default and now
[5574.56 --> 5584.48]  Now they are offering a 70 30 split if creators are willing to remove any non-nintendo content from their videos
[5585.60 --> 5587.28]  Like non-nintendo games
[5587.28 --> 5592.40]  Like are they for real?
[5593.44 --> 5598.96]  This is there isn't even a debate for us to have like are they are they are they even I
[5599.12 --> 5601.76]  I said this before the show. It's gonna be kind of a boring topic because there's
[5603.04 --> 5605.60]  You like can't really have another stance
[5605.60 --> 5610.00]  I can't even devils advocate you like
[5611.12 --> 5613.04]  What do you want five percent?
[5613.60 --> 5620.96]  I even no I even I even tried to like I don't know if you remember this but back when they first started claiming monetization
[5621.36 --> 5624.32]  That was back when we were doing nintendo streams on the after party
[5624.64 --> 5626.64]  I was like well, I kind of get it
[5626.64 --> 5631.28]  It is their music and it is their asset and in much the same way that if I put someone else's
[5632.00 --> 5637.52]  Music as a backdrop to wan show they could claim the monetization from it. Well, okay
[5637.60 --> 5639.12]  Yeah, I I guess so
[5639.20 --> 5642.24]  But if you're gonna then go and say well, no, okay
[5642.80 --> 5647.04]  We do understand the benefit that game streamers and let's players have
[5647.04 --> 5648.40]  S
[5648.40 --> 5654.56]  Actually for titles like a super smash brothers for example where there is no
[5655.52 --> 5662.48]  There is no entertainment in the viewing experience that overlaps with the entertainment of the playing experience
[5663.28 --> 5668.48]  spectating super smash and playing super smash are two distinctly different
[5668.88 --> 5674.88]  Experiences and the people who are into that might not necessarily have been into that and weren't gonna buy it anyway necessarily and the people who want to play it
[5674.88 --> 5677.60]  Storyline driven watching it is not a replacement
[5678.32 --> 5687.28]  So particularly for games like that or like a mario kart these are these are great examples of competitive style stuff different experiences viewing versus playing
[5687.76 --> 5691.04]  Um, so so nintendo has acknowledged. Oh, maybe there is a benefit to this
[5691.04 --> 5696.80]  Maybe we shouldn't take all the money away from people who are driving eyeballs to our to our games
[5697.44 --> 5702.40]  Um, but then they go and they kind of they want to like nickel and dime these people like oh
[5702.40 --> 5706.96]  No, we like really need the revenue so badly because we you and smash and
[5707.52 --> 5709.44]  Mario cart are not selling really well
[5709.76 --> 5714.96]  And the entire internet isn't hyped over the moon about the upcoming zelda game pretty well right now
[5715.20 --> 5716.16]  Yeah
[5716.16 --> 5719.60]  We you and smash and mario kart are specifically doing pretty good right now
[5720.16 --> 5722.16]  So they should like not do this
[5723.20 --> 5725.20]  Because they're probably fine
[5725.20 --> 5726.88]  Oh
[5726.88 --> 5734.32]  It's frustrating so basically we don't even game stream, but we think this is ridiculous new game stream. Yeah. Yeah, so that's ridiculous
[5735.04 --> 5738.88]  Uh, i've done game streaming of nintendo content because I just don't care
[5740.56 --> 5745.04]  But it's not into it for that. I wanted to play freaking mario kart. So like whatever
[5746.00 --> 5750.96]  Leave me alone. Yeah, it helps that you have a day job. Yes, but I mean it's one of those things where you know
[5750.96 --> 5753.84]  It's it's easy for us to say yeah if we want to stream a game
[5753.84 --> 5757.44]  We're really not going to give two craps about it because our day job is making tech videos
[5757.44 --> 5759.28]  Yeah, but for people who do rely on it
[5759.28 --> 5764.08]  This is extremely frustrating and this is the kind of problem that we do potentially face in the future where it's
[5764.40 --> 5768.56]  Powers that be that control our revenue stream not us. It's funny
[5768.96 --> 5773.84]  Actually, I saw a comment on I think it was on whole room water cooling something anyway
[5774.40 --> 5776.64]  someone asked what do these guys do for a living and
[5777.28 --> 5783.44]  I was I was about to reply and I saw there was already a reply. I think they build computers. I'm like
[5784.48 --> 5785.52]  What?
[5785.52 --> 5788.56]  How can you watch our videos and not know that we make videos for a living?
[5790.32 --> 5793.76]  Some people don't understand how long it takes to make it. I guess that's true. Yeah
[5794.56 --> 5798.72]  I mean actually, you know what perfect example of this um my wife yvonne
[5798.72 --> 5799.28]  I'm
[5799.28 --> 5804.16]  Had no idea how long b-roll takes for the
[5804.80 --> 5809.60]  Upgraded new and improved linus tech tips format because brandon was over at my house
[5809.60 --> 5814.88]  Which is the only place where there's enough room to set up that obato gaming cockpit the video for which by the way is coming out this week
[5814.88 --> 5816.80]  Pretty excited for that. I'm gonna watch that one. Yeah
[5817.04 --> 5818.40]  Um
[5818.40 --> 5822.72]  So he was over filming it and we were there for like, you know five hours and she was like, yeah
[5822.72 --> 5827.28]  I had no idea it takes so long like yeah, and the editing takes even longer than that
[5828.16 --> 5834.64]  So there's I mean there's pre-production and then there's actual filming which is actually by far the shortest part. Yeah
[5835.12 --> 5837.12]  scripting writing
[5837.36 --> 5839.36]  film uh editing
[5839.60 --> 5841.60]  Testing things
[5842.32 --> 5849.92]  Yeah, all those things take a lot longer than me standing there and reading off a teleprompter nick testing the actual video setting it live at the right time
[5850.48 --> 5854.24]  Yeah, the forum topic all that stuff. There's tons of things
[5854.24 --> 5858.48]  All right. Well, I think that's pretty much it for the land show for tonight
[5859.28 --> 5865.60]  You guys are awesome and we thank you for watching really hot in here. I know it's getting hot in here
[5866.16 --> 5868.16]  So turn off all the streams
[5868.16 --> 5869.04]  I am
[5869.04 --> 5875.68]  Dancing hot I will take my clothes off and then their monetization for the stream was stolen
[5875.68 --> 5880.12]  what
[5880.96 --> 5881.60]  Pull
[5883.28 --> 5885.64]  T Nej
[5885.64 --> 5890.02]  Every time I hear that I think of the restaurant.
[5890.86 --> 5893.58]  Yeah, but the restaurant's not the original.
[5898.06 --> 5901.16]  Master off your square spaces with knowledge.
[5903.74 --> 5906.00]  Learn about how things fall.
[5906.66 --> 5907.70]  I'm just going to cut you off.
