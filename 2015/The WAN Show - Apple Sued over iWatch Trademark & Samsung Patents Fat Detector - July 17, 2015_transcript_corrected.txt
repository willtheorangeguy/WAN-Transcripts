[0.00 → 4.00] And where audio problems are just the beginnings of our failure.
[4.22 → 9.92] So today I am even later than I was supposed to be because I had some audio issues there
[9.92 → 11.48] and I do apologize for that.
[11.62 → 14.82] Every time I set up in a completely new and different environment,
[15.28 → 17.38] it's always a new and different adventure.
[17.58 → 22.66] So today I put together my streaming pack, the XA20 camera, a tripod,
[23.26 → 26.46] the Racer Blade laptop, a capture card, a mouse, a mouse pad,
[26.46 → 30.68] a Racer Blade laptop, which unfortunately doesn't have wired Ethernet.
[31.02 → 35.08] So I had to bring along my handy-dandy little USB to Ethernet adapter.
[35.40 → 39.34] And then I borrowed a table and I borrowed a place to stream from the NCI guys.
[39.40 → 46.50] So my original brilliant plan was actually to film everything that I needed back at our studio today
[46.50 → 50.12] and then come out to NCI to film later and do the WAN show from here,
[50.22 → 56.14] which would save me a trip to Richmond later tonight when I come out to play badminton.
[56.14 → 57.52] Apparently my mic is too loud.
[58.72 → 60.92] Well, I can't turn it down much.
[61.60 → 64.68] So, okay, recording devices.
[66.56 → 69.26] Blip pity-bloppity levels, whatever.
[69.94 → 71.32] There, hopefully that's fine.
[71.72 → 74.48] Not much I can do other than just guess at this point
[74.48 → 79.84] because me having my monitoring on seems to be what caused the problems before.
[79.84 → 82.92] So there you go, guys.
[84.80 → 86.06] Apparently peaking still.
[86.48 → 87.30] It's echo in the room.
[87.50 → 88.10] Mic good.
[88.72 → 91.84] You guys drive me absolutely too...
[92.42 → 95.48] You guys drive me absolutely crazy with this stuff.
[95.56 → 96.44] You're killing me here.
[96.44 → 100.02] So, yeah.
[100.42 → 100.78] All right.
[100.90 → 102.42] We're just going to have to roll with...
[102.42 → 102.74] You know what?
[102.78 → 103.94] Maybe Jack can help me out.
[104.00 → 104.72] Hey, Jack.
[106.66 → 107.74] Are you on the stream?
[107.82 → 108.56] Does it sound okay?
[109.26 → 110.84] I've got people saying it's too loud.
[110.96 → 112.20] People saying it's too quiet.
[112.34 → 116.10] People saying that they've had too much bourbon to drink today
[116.10 → 117.82] and they can't hear anything.
[118.82 → 121.80] They're blind, and they can't hear.
[123.24 → 124.46] So, yeah.
[126.14 → 126.80] All right.
[126.84 → 130.26] So I'm going to go ahead and kick off with our first topic of the day.
[130.52 → 134.18] I do not have Luke on the stream today.
[134.30 → 137.00] He is actually on vacation today.
[137.00 → 141.76] So he's gone to the Pemberton Music Festival, whatever that thing is called.
[141.92 → 147.52] Fortunately, the wildfires haven't completely gotten out of control up there.
[147.52 → 150.12] So the music festival is a go.
[150.32 → 154.02] He and Nick and Burke have all gone up for the weekend.
[154.20 → 156.76] So that means I am on my own today for the WAN show.
[156.86 → 160.16] But the good news is that I have a bunch of great topics for you guys today,
[160.26 → 170.70] including the recent reveal that Skylike Eons are going to be rumoured to have up to 28 CPU cores.
[170.70 → 177.68] I mean, I thought the current 18 core Haswell-based Leon that I had was like,
[178.22 → 179.58] wow, that's so amazing.
[179.78 → 180.80] It's got 18 cores.
[180.98 → 181.30] No, no.
[181.38 → 182.84] We're talking 28 cores.
[183.38 → 187.50] Apple is apparently being sued over the watch trademark,
[188.46 → 193.28] something that makes a ton of sense because their watch is called the watch.
[193.34 → 195.84] At least I think College Humour told me that it was called the watch.
[195.84 → 196.86] More on that later.
[197.16 → 205.34] Also, Boeing has apparently patented a laser-powered fusion fission jet engine concept.
[205.88 → 207.82] Fusion and fission and lasers.
[207.96 → 209.12] I mean, does it get any better than that?
[209.34 → 210.26] Yes, it does.
[210.36 → 211.38] When I roll the intro.
[211.38 → 237.40] And our sponsor today, Dollar J-Club.
[237.40 → 242.56] As well as fixity.
[242.70 → 242.94] Woo!
[245.74 → 246.54] All right.
[246.70 → 250.76] So let's kick off our first topic of the day.
[250.86 → 252.28] Actually, this is okay.
[252.34 → 255.98] We're apparently going to start with like the worst news of the day.
[256.12 → 258.62] So Nintendo released a statement.
[258.88 → 260.56] You can actually check that out here.
[260.56 → 274.56] That, yeah, wow, this is like, I just, it's hard for me to imagine if my life were to be summarized in such a succinct and efficient manner.
[275.40 → 283.42] Like if Linus Media Group issued like a notification of death and personnel change of a representative director.
[283.42 → 292.60] So president of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata, has passed away at the age of merely 55.
[293.22 → 302.32] Which, you know, a couple of thousand years ago would have been impressive that he managed to be so old and still alive.
[302.46 → 307.56] But today feels like he's been taken away from us much, much too young.
[307.56 → 315.28] I just, oh man, there's something very, there's something very cold about this, this document here.
[315.64 → 317.82] Career record, June 2000, appointed as director.
[317.94 → 319.48] May 2002, appointed as president.
[319.92 → 323.66] June 2003, appointed as CEO of Nintendo of America, Inc.
[323.66 → 331.80] So that is, if you're, if you're into gaming, that is some, that is some pretty crummy news.
[331.92 → 334.70] He actually has been with Nintendo for a very long time.
[335.04 → 337.66] Started out with HAL, worked on Kirby as well as Earthbound.
[338.60 → 339.96] Total cult classic.
[340.16 → 345.40] A lot of people cutting their RPG gaming teeth on Earthbound and other games of that era.
[345.82 → 348.58] Later worked on programming for the Pokémon games.
[348.88 → 350.92] Pushed development of the Wii and DS.
[350.92 → 356.60] However you may or may not feel about this, it seemed like a good direction for Nintendo at the time.
[356.68 → 358.68] They had some of their most successful years ever.
[359.14 → 363.78] So pushed development of the Wii and the DS to appeal to people who weren't necessarily gamers yet.
[364.20 → 369.46] So really recognized that gaming was becoming more than just something that people do in their mom's basement.
[370.14 → 373.32] And passed away from bile duct cancer.
[373.54 → 376.96] So very, very unfortunate news for this week.
[376.96 → 377.40] Yeah.
[379.68 → 381.24] So there you go.
[381.32 → 384.52] I guess that's what we're, that's what we're starting with this week.
[384.88 → 386.34] Star Wars Battlefront.
[386.56 → 390.98] More bad news for, I mean, obviously to a much, to a much lesser degree.
[391.08 → 393.68] The original article here is from PC Gamer.
[393.88 → 399.44] And actually I'm, I'm totally thrown off by not having my, not having my co-host with me today.
[399.44 → 406.08] So I'm going to go ahead and pop that link into the Twitch chat before I bring it up in my browser here.
[406.14 → 413.34] I actually really like this, this one host having the article like quite large beside me.
[413.40 → 416.02] And actually scrollable and mostly viewable kind of thing.
[416.24 → 418.40] Maybe I should just kick Luke off the WAN show permanently.
[419.34 → 419.92] No, I'm just kidding.
[419.98 → 420.62] I'm not going to do that.
[421.24 → 425.78] Star Wars Battlefront won't support split screen play on the PC.
[425.78 → 437.14] Now, I don't personally understand why most PC gamers would have ever expected this.
[438.06 → 449.90] It's not like the typical PC gaming, you know, you know, like you go on, you know, r slash PC Master Race or, or battle stations or whatever.
[449.90 → 462.68] You're not going to find a lot of PC setups that are like, yeah, here's my PC hooked up to like a big monitor with four controllers for all my split screen, you know, racing gaming with my friends.
[462.70 → 465.60] It's just, it's, it's not something that we've typically seen on the PC.
[465.60 → 473.58] But the flip side of that is I would love to see more of those things that are taken for granted on the console supported on the PC.
[473.68 → 484.00] Because it's not like you can't hook up an Xbox controller or four to a PC and have a really great cooperative or competitive gaming experience with your friends on a single display.
[484.88 → 490.98] And, yeah, so supports co-op play on Xbox One and PS4, but not PC.
[490.98 → 493.58] So no split screen and no local co-op.
[495.58 → 509.24] Lack of co-op games on the PC is another one that really grinds my gears, but I don't really need to get too deep into that because I'm sure that you guys have heard that in the past from me a fair bit.
[509.94 → 515.12] So we've still got a lot of people saying the Jack, you're sure the stream is not too quiet, right?
[516.16 → 517.56] Oh, Jack is gone.
[518.36 → 520.34] Jack, are you sure the stream is not too quiet?
[520.98 → 522.48] I have a headphone watch.
[524.58 → 525.64] He put on headphones.
[526.08 → 527.02] He put on headphones.
[527.18 → 528.04] Okay, I'll tell you what.
[529.54 → 531.52] I will turn it up a little bit.
[531.66 → 531.92] There.
[532.04 → 532.74] Are we happy?
[533.16 → 534.16] Hopefully we're happy.
[534.28 → 535.46] I really hope we're happy.
[535.84 → 537.22] You guys are driving me crazy.
[537.40 → 537.96] Twitch chat.
[538.28 → 538.94] Now I know.
[539.34 → 544.04] I saw someone's message in the Twitch chat like, oh, blah, blah, blah.
[544.04 → 548.62] You know, you don't interact with your Twitch chat viewers at all.
[548.86 → 549.68] You know why?
[549.68 → 552.72] Because you guys are usually trolling the crap out of me.
[553.44 → 555.14] That's why I can't interact with you.
[555.34 → 557.84] You have lost your interaction privileges.
[558.56 → 559.78] That is what happened here.
[560.44 → 562.72] That is what happened, my friends.
[562.72 → 566.84] So let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here.
[566.98 → 568.08] Ah, yes.
[568.58 → 574.48] IBM and NVIDIA launched supercomputer centres of excellence.
[574.48 → 582.74] Supercomputer centres of excellence.
[582.74 → 584.44] Let's go ahead and pull this article up.
[585.04 → 585.72] Uppity bop pity.
[585.90 → 586.62] News items.
[587.12 → 587.60] Redirecting.
[587.98 → 594.14] So basically what this amounts to is, here we go, at both Oak Ridge National Laboratory
[594.14 → 596.72] and I want to say some other location.
[596.86 → 598.84] It's in my notes, but not here.
[599.18 → 601.30] So these are, oh, wow.
[601.40 → 602.98] There's actually, oh.
[603.98 → 607.64] I remember reading this article and thinking, oh, yeah, this is all like interesting stuff.
[607.90 → 608.24] Blah, blah, blah.
[608.24 → 609.74] I hope it's in my notes.
[609.80 → 610.70] It's actually not in the notes.
[610.70 → 611.98] So I'm just going to cheat and look at the article.
[612.14 → 618.18] So Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore in, they're going to be delivered in 2017 and operational
[618.18 → 619.38] by 2018.
[619.94 → 623.82] And they are going to be called the yep, sure wish I had this.
[624.60 → 625.34] Oh, okay.
[625.52 → 625.74] Yep.
[625.86 → 626.26] There you go.
[626.30 → 626.76] Got the memo.
[627.02 → 629.26] So they're going to be called Summit and Sierra.
[629.62 → 635.50] So these are part of IBM's whole contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.
[635.50 → 638.26] And they're going to be used for a number of really cool things.
[638.26 → 643.56] So some of it is going to be kind of your typical super computing stuff like, you know,
[643.66 → 645.32] weather mapping and all that kind of stuff.
[645.38 → 651.76] You know, just staying ahead in the supercomputer rat race of the, you know, the other nations
[651.76 → 654.82] that are working on their own proprietary supercomputer systems.
[655.18 → 655.62] China.
[657.58 → 660.48] And then some of the stuff that they're going to be doing is really cool.
[660.48 → 666.34] So one of them is apparently going to be set to the task of mapping the inside of the Earth.
[666.34 → 671.84] I mean, can you even begin to imagine what kind of useful information that we could possibly
[671.84 → 676.64] gain about the inside of the Earth, whether it's to do with the composition, whether it's
[676.64 → 683.54] to do with, you know, wow, like it's, yeah, it's sort of more than my imagination can handle.
[683.74 → 690.80] So yeah, mapping the inside of the Earth, which actually leads me to another really cool
[690.80 → 691.68] topic.
[691.68 → 695.20] Samsung has apparently filed a patent.
[695.34 → 698.54] So the original article here is from Android Authority.
[698.68 → 701.18] Let's go ahead and pop this up here.
[702.36 → 702.88] All right.
[702.98 → 704.84] Let's go ahead and post this in the Twitch chat.
[705.48 → 712.22] Samsung has apparently patented a sensor to detect your body fat.
[712.22 → 720.42] So we know that whether it's Apple or whether it's Samsung or whether it's any other profitable
[720.42 → 725.54] smartphone maker, which more on that a little bit later, there aren't a lot of them,
[725.78 → 731.24] whether it's Apple or whether it's Samsung, smartphone makers are really into the whole
[731.24 → 736.58] idea of making your phone or your smartwatch or whatever other devices you're carrying around
[736.58 → 743.00] with you, making them into whether, wow, I want to be really careful what I say here,
[743.06 → 748.30] because what I was about to say was making them into useful tools for, you know, monitoring
[748.30 → 750.80] your health and living a more active lifestyle.
[750.80 → 758.08] When really my personal philosophy on this whole thing is that it doesn't do much of anything
[758.08 → 760.98] other than make you want to buy it more.
[760.98 → 762.96] Like, I think it's just a pure sales pitch.
[763.14 → 768.78] If we can convince someone that buying this phone or buying this smartwatch will make them
[768.78 → 775.32] lose 20 pounds, then it's that whole buying something based on self-image rather than buying
[775.32 → 777.82] something based on like a rational decision.
[777.92 → 783.60] Anyway, it's no secret that they want not only to make us feel like they're useful for these
[783.60 → 788.08] things, but to actually make them functionally better for these things.
[788.08 → 794.66] So this is a huge step in that direction because there's only so much information that you can
[794.66 → 796.20] get from a pedometer.
[796.74 → 802.90] And as my time with the Apple Watch has definitely taught me, it's not that much.
[804.18 → 808.10] So, I mean, I'd be sitting there, I'd be sitting there working on my review.
[808.44 → 812.90] One feature that I didn't use because I'm just not that into the whole health features thing
[812.90 → 814.26] on phones and smartwatches.
[814.26 → 818.66] So one feature that I didn't touch the whole time I was naturally using the product for
[818.66 → 822.64] my review was one where you can set a predetermined workout.
[822.84 → 828.24] So you can say like, hey, I want to, you know, burn X number of calories by walking really
[828.24 → 828.70] fast.
[828.76 → 832.28] So, hey, can you count me down on this, and I'll, you know, go do that.
[832.36 → 835.92] So I was just drinking around with the menu and I turned that on and then I kind of forgot
[835.92 → 836.42] about it.
[836.42 → 842.36] And then I realized, you know, 10 minutes later that I had actually tracked, I think
[842.36 → 845.90] it was something like 4% of my brisk walking exercise.
[846.70 → 851.98] And I had literally been sitting there writing a review about the Apple Watch and how I don't
[851.98 → 853.96] actually think those kinds of features are that useful.
[853.96 → 858.12] So Apple went ahead and proved my point for me there.
[858.26 → 865.62] But if they could measure body fat, that may actually give us some usable data over the
[865.62 → 866.62] much longer term.
[868.18 → 874.26] You know, the problem though is that that doesn't really tell us a big picture unless it's accompanied
[874.26 → 876.14] by accurate data.
[876.24 → 881.04] And that's another real challenge is even the Apple Watch, which was hailed as, you know,
[881.04 → 885.08] going to be game changing with all the health related, body related sensors on it.
[885.74 → 891.52] Even the Apple Watch has been found to not be that accurate of a heart rate monitor unless
[891.52 → 894.48] you like, you know, practically bolt it to your wrist.
[894.48 → 900.24] So this body fat thing without other accurate data doesn't really give us a whole picture,
[900.38 → 906.46] but it's definitely a move in the right direction because over a span of, you know, six months
[906.46 → 910.68] or whatever else, if you see significant changes, if you're taking measurements daily, you
[910.68 → 911.72] know, even if they're not that.
[912.06 → 916.14] And I'm going to say the wrong one because accurate and precise are not the same thing.
[916.18 → 920.30] For those of you who didn't know that, one of them means close to the real value.
[920.42 → 925.90] The other one means consistently a value, but maybe not necessarily that close.
[925.90 → 933.44] So even if the reading is not that precise, I think that's the one where if you're not
[933.44 → 936.38] precise, you could be scattered, but probably around, you could still be accurate.
[936.38 → 940.88] So if they're accurate but not precise, taking many readings over a long period of time could
[940.88 → 943.98] give you some really useful data about what it is you're doing and whether it's
[943.98 → 944.20] helping.
[944.42 → 950.40] And, you know, with the way that fitness vlogging and lifestyle vlogging is taking off, I mean,
[950.60 → 957.68] even in the tech community of all places, you look at guys like Jay or Jerry that are doing
[957.68 → 961.08] frequent updates on their personal fitness goals.
[961.08 → 967.90] I mean, that kind of stuff is great and giving people new tools is great, but it still doesn't
[967.90 → 968.72] change.
[969.92 → 975.90] It still doesn't change my perception of these features as tacking things onto a product that
[975.90 → 980.96] seemed to be designed to sell them to us rather than designed for people to genuinely use them.
[981.04 → 983.10] So that patent was just granted.
[983.26 → 987.30] So there's no word yet on when we will see this technology in phones.
[987.30 → 990.54] But the idea is that you would just hold your smartphone, and it would measure your body fat
[990.54 → 993.18] percentage using electrical impedance readings.
[993.68 → 995.24] So very cool stuff.
[995.96 → 1000.80] I guess that leads us pretty well into this next topic here.
[1000.94 → 1004.48] This is absolutely mind-blowing.
[1004.88 → 1006.70] And I will show it to you guys in a second.
[1008.08 → 1009.98] So the latest estimates here.
[1011.50 → 1012.54] There we go.
[1012.54 → 1020.08] Luke always does it the not lazy way and makes it so it doesn't leave that ugly Google link
[1020.08 → 1020.74] in the Twitch chat.
[1020.92 → 1023.90] But sorry, I'm running the show by myself today here, guys.
[1024.00 → 1024.64] I apologize.
[1025.44 → 1025.92] Report.
[1026.74 → 1034.86] Apple takes 92% of smartphone market profits on just 20% of sales.
[1035.42 → 1041.30] So to put that number in perspective, this is a Wall Street Journal quote.
[1041.30 → 1045.64] Roughly 1,000 companies make smartphones.
[1047.10 → 1052.08] One of those companies reaps nearly all the profits.
[1052.56 → 1055.40] Is that not absolutely mind-boggling?
[1055.70 → 1059.04] And you can point to a lot of different causes for this.
[1059.12 → 1066.52] You can point to the fact that Apple's hardware is frankly not that high spec compared to a flagship
[1066.52 → 1074.68] Android phone that's going to have eight CPU cores in it, a high-end GPU, although Apple does put powerful GPUs in their smartphones.
[1074.84 → 1077.88] It's going to have a 1440p display.
[1077.98 → 1083.02] Apple doesn't have any smartphones that feature 1440 displays.
[1083.10 → 1085.96] They just finally went 1080p with the iPhone 6 Plus.
[1085.96 → 1093.08] You know, Android makers have been putting NFC in their phones for years, whereas Apple only just finally rolled that out.
[1093.68 → 1097.54] Android phone makers, I mean, these are things that everyone has to pay the same amount for.
[1097.64 → 1107.98] In fact, thanks to Apple's, well, their buying power, thanks to Apple's buying power, they probably don't even pay the same for things like memory or flash storage.
[1107.98 → 1115.88] Apple doesn't put as much RAM in their smartphones because they can control the operating system to the point where they simply do not need it.
[1115.94 → 1117.24] So there are a lot of reasons.
[1117.38 → 1120.12] I mean, Apple charges a high price for every phone they sell.
[1120.40 → 1126.02] You can look at Samsung and go, oh, well, you know, they have a $600 or $700 phone or whatever.
[1126.18 → 1127.52] Linus, that's an S6 Active.
[1127.58 → 1128.84] That's a $600 phone.
[1129.22 → 1130.70] S6 Edge is an expensive phone.
[1130.70 → 1144.88] Yeah, but the thing is that companies like Samsung are also spending R&D money on developing low-end phones where the sale price is actually much closer to the bomb cost of the unit than you would probably think.
[1145.20 → 1146.90] Because, you know, that's one of the things.
[1147.00 → 1155.58] You know those articles that come out every time a new iPhone or a new Galaxy S whatever is released where someone does a teardown and is like,
[1155.58 → 1162.50] okay, well, the bomb cost for this panel and that motion sensor and that button is whatever it happens to be.
[1162.62 → 1163.58] And you kind of go, wow, really?
[1163.66 → 1168.32] That thing only costs like $130 to make, and it's $600 retail?
[1169.54 → 1170.90] So think about this for a second.
[1171.40 → 1177.62] The R&D that goes into producing a phone is going to be a lot regardless of whether it's a $600 phone or a $200 phone.
[1177.62 → 1191.54] And if your cost on a high-end phone can only be as high as like $150, $170, then your cost on a $200 phone in order to make, you know, $400 of gross margin on it,
[1192.34 → 1195.68] well, gee, that math doesn't work at all.
[1195.82 → 1204.24] And something a lot of people don't realize is that a flagship, you know, Snapdragon 810 actually doesn't cost that much more than an 808.
[1204.24 → 1210.96] Like there isn't a huge discount because much like what you'll see on, you see this on desktop processors too.
[1211.18 → 1219.82] You can buy an Extreme Edition for $1,000, or you can buy, you know, a 5820K for $350 or whatever that is.
[1220.38 → 1223.88] Those two chips cost the same.
[1223.88 → 1231.88] So when you are responsible for actually manufacturing the chips, you can actually, like you can sell it for a lot,
[1232.00 → 1239.52] but then your cost to manufacture it and therefore your discount that you can give on lower-end products isn't necessarily that different.
[1239.92 → 1245.52] So if you're making low-end smartphones, you are basically buying market share.
[1245.52 → 1253.28] You've got to have some other kind of agenda, whether you want people signed up for, you know, your partner apps that you're including on the phone
[1253.28 → 1257.98] or whether you want people locked into like what Samsung was doing for the longest time,
[1258.04 → 1261.40] where they'd include all their own, you know, mail app, an app store.
[1261.54 → 1267.08] Like if you want to make future app sales and take a cut of that or whatever else the case may be,
[1267.08 → 1274.64] because you are not making money on that handset once you factor in R&D and the margins that the carriers want to make
[1274.64 → 1276.42] or the retailers want to make or whatever else.
[1276.58 → 1280.24] So just to give you guys some idea of what the rest of the landscape looks like,
[1280.42 → 1289.30] Samsung took a further 15% of the profits, which is kind of a funny way of doing the math
[1289.30 → 1293.30] because if Apple took 92% and Samsung took 15%, well, hold on a second,
[1293.30 → 1297.96] that's 107% of the profit in the smartphone industry.
[1298.10 → 1298.58] Linus, what are you doing?
[1298.92 → 1305.16] Well, that's because pretty much everyone else out there is making a loss on their smartphones
[1305.16 → 1309.92] to make up for that money that Samsung and Apple are going to make.
[1310.66 → 1315.04] And it's amazing what a reversal there's been in the last few years.
[1315.04 → 1323.18] I mean, it was a mere three years ago that, hold on a second,
[1323.34 → 1328.82] that we were looking at 50-50 between Samsung and Apple for these numbers,
[1329.34 → 1332.98] whereas Apple has just absolutely, you know, it's hilarious.
[1333.48 → 1338.86] Go figure, Apple got even more dominant than before by delivering what people obviously wanted.
[1338.86 → 1344.86] I mean, how many people bought a Galaxy Note simply because they had,
[1345.04 → 1346.20] this is a great straw poll.
[1346.62 → 1350.48] Okay, I want the iPhone users to answer this for me though.
[1351.82 → 1355.88] Let me just, apparently there's a new version of straw poll launching at some point here.
[1356.32 → 1365.14] So how many bought a Note or similar large, okay, okay, how many converted?
[1365.14 → 1376.48] Okay, from iPhone to Android simply because Apple offered no, sorry, I'm talking really slow,
[1376.86 → 1380.56] no large screen offering.
[1382.06 → 1385.36] It's hard to talk while you type and not talk at the same speed that you type
[1385.36 → 1387.94] while slowing down your typing because you're trying to talk at the same time.
[1387.94 → 1395.54] So let's go with yes, no, and turnip as usual.
[1395.94 → 1399.72] I actually really like having the stream computer right in front of me here.
[1399.92 → 1403.14] It is super-duper awesome and nice.
[1403.60 → 1404.44] So there we go, guys.
[1404.56 → 1405.96] Vote in that straw poll.
[1407.18 → 1409.34] Let's have a look at the results here as they come in.
[1409.66 → 1412.84] Many of you voting for turnip, which by the way, is our latest shirt
[1412.84 → 1418.40] and is available right now at teespring.com slash vote number four turnip.
[1418.54 → 1420.96] Let's go ahead and drop that in there and go back to our straw poll here.
[1421.88 → 1422.52] Fascinating.
[1422.76 → 1423.80] So there you go.
[1423.92 → 1424.44] Go figure.
[1424.66 → 1429.32] Apple's even more dominant today with their super premium pricing, high-end devices,
[1429.78 → 1433.98] simply by giving the people what they have been asking for,
[1434.32 → 1438.56] for like, what was it, three years between the release of the first Note
[1438.56 → 1440.50] and the iPhone 6 Plus.
[1440.90 → 1442.82] Personally not a huge fan of the iPhone 6 Plus.
[1442.92 → 1445.46] I have small hands, but hey, a lot of people want it.
[1445.52 → 1448.04] It is better for the media enjoyment experience.
[1448.04 → 1452.96] It's something that I have noticed going from the LG G4 to the S6 Active,
[1453.12 → 1456.02] which is the phone review that I'm working on at the moment here.
[1456.96 → 1459.00] I've got 60% of you voting for turnip.
[1459.06 → 1463.22] Really do appreciate the turnip voters showing up in full force here.
[1463.38 → 1466.38] I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the Twitch chat is always trolling me
[1466.38 → 1471.94] when I encourage them to, you know, turnip all over everything it is that we're doing.
[1472.68 → 1477.64] Which isn't to say that I want to hear about fire poles any more ever again at all.
[1479.70 → 1481.56] Yeah, I mean, really, guys.
[1482.22 → 1482.62] Really.
[1483.00 → 1484.82] There is nothing that I can do.
[1484.82 → 1491.24] I cannot put a fire pole in the office for obvious liability reasons, you guys.
[1492.42 → 1492.90] Ah.
[1492.90 → 1493.20] Ah.
[1493.88 → 1496.82] Okay, so we've got more news articles here.
[1497.40 → 1500.88] Let's go ahead, and I'm going to grab the Linus Tech Tips forum link here.
[1501.34 → 1503.26] I'm going to wait for the redirect this time.
[1503.36 → 1504.06] Post that in the Twitch.
[1504.24 → 1505.30] Where'd my Twitch chat go?
[1505.56 → 1506.66] Where's my Twitch chat?
[1506.80 → 1509.94] And the Twitch chat has exploded asking for fire poles.
[1510.08 → 1511.50] Of course that was going to happen.
[1512.20 → 1517.70] Researchers build a transistor from a molecule and a few atoms.
[1517.70 → 1526.76] It's funny because this lands on the same week when we've got news out of Intel that they are going to be for the first time.
[1526.86 → 1528.44] And I think, what is it?
[1528.80 → 1531.66] I want to say like six years or something like that.
[1532.08 → 1540.78] Intel has changed their forecast saying that they are not going to be able to stick to their TikTok strategy.
[1540.78 → 1551.04] Which does a die shrink every other cycle and then a refinement of their microarchitecture every other cycle.
[1551.16 → 1552.84] And they have been like on schedule.
[1553.08 → 1557.00] They called it TikTok because it was going to be reliable like a clock.
[1557.50 → 1560.82] Moore's Law was not going to let us down.
[1560.82 → 1564.66] Well, for the first time ever, Intel has stumbled and then boom!
[1564.98 → 1571.06] We've got news dropping that researchers are building transistors from a molecule and a few atoms.
[1571.36 → 1573.80] So it works similarly to quantum dots.
[1574.16 → 1579.82] But the transistor depends on just the charge state of one organic molecule.
[1580.68 → 1588.10] So just a single electron affects the molecule state with individual atoms of indium surrounding the molecule and regulating the electron flow.
[1588.10 → 1594.20] This could lead to integrating these sorts of transistors into traditional CPUs.
[1594.20 → 1603.70] So this isn't like some crazy like, oh, it's only going to be useful for like, you know, quantum computers that are liquid helium cooled or whatever the case may be.
[1603.78 → 1608.04] No, this could turn into something that you could actually use in your computer.
[1608.46 → 1610.16] Extremely exciting stuff.
[1610.22 → 1614.78] Which leads us into those other, I mean these are fairly rapid fire news topics.
[1614.78 → 1617.38] But I'm still going to go ahead and post these bad boys here.
[1618.10 → 1625.98] So TSMC is going to be starting testing on their 10 nanometre process starting next year.
[1626.62 → 1630.92] Which is another, another huge, huge bit of news.
[1631.38 → 1637.42] So competition between Samsung and TSMC in 10 nanometre FinFET market heats up.
[1637.84 → 1638.76] Well, hold on a second.
[1639.10 → 1641.00] Where does Intel figure into all this?
[1641.40 → 1643.32] Intel, well, that's our next news topic.
[1643.50 → 1646.10] So for now, let's just talk about TSMC and Samsung.
[1646.10 → 1655.48] So TSMC is apparently ramping things up and really putting their foot on the pedal in order to have a crack at Apple's A10 processor production.
[1655.74 → 1665.44] So I guess that also would align with the rumours that Apple's A10 processor will be produced at a 10 nanometre process node.
[1665.44 → 1670.80] So that could yield apparently, and this is sort of, this is all forecast stuff.
[1670.88 → 1672.22] So it's not really that meaningful today.
[1672.30 → 1678.10] But we're looking at a potential 20% performance gain with a 40% reduction in power consumption.
[1678.60 → 1679.30] Who here?
[1679.42 → 1680.78] Oh, this is a good one.
[1681.46 → 1682.90] Straw poll time, my friends.
[1682.90 → 1695.90] If Apple gets a 40% power consumption reduction on the A10, will Apple use it to extend battery life?
[1697.26 → 1698.86] Yes or no?
[1698.86 → 1707.98] Remember, guys, the other option is that Apple will simply turn it into thinner iPhones and iPads yet again,
[1708.28 → 1716.32] completely ignoring the fact that some people, like me, legitimately want just more freaking battery life.
[1716.44 → 1717.00] Wow!
[1717.56 → 1721.06] We've got these votes coming in here, guys, with 72%.
[1721.06 → 1723.84] Even Turnip is losing this vote today.
[1723.84 → 1731.28] A massive 70% of you are saying, no, Apple will not use the power savings to extend battery life.
[1731.36 → 1734.20] And there are legitimately good things they could do with it.
[1734.26 → 1742.44] For example, I've been saying, well, since my MacBook review, that I think the direction that Apple's heading is a MacBook,
[1742.64 → 1748.46] like an ultraportable laptop that is powered by their tablet processors and smartphone processors.
[1748.74 → 1750.12] So that's something they could do.
[1750.12 → 1760.26] They could use that extra 20%, you know, performance and then 40% power to, like, actually make a bigger chip that consumes, you know, a similar amount of power,
[1760.34 → 1762.32] but is, like, actually, like, way higher performance.
[1762.62 → 1764.06] And they could go and put it in a laptop.
[1764.84 → 1768.66] Or on the phone and on the tablet side, they could just make them thinner.
[1768.78 → 1772.52] And I'm like, how many bend gates do we need?
[1773.34 → 1774.84] How many bend gates do we need?
[1774.88 → 1775.78] That's all I have to say.
[1775.78 → 1785.16] It looks like the vast majority of you are reinforcing my disappointing hunch that Apple is going to ignore people like me who...
[1785.16 → 1786.00] I'm even...
[1786.00 → 1793.92] I even ran out on the S6 Active one day, which kind of surprised me, because that's a 3,500 William hour battery compared to, I think it's...
[1793.92 → 1796.78] I want to say 3,850 or something like that on the Droid Turbo.
[1796.78 → 1801.40] So, yeah, I actually ran out one day.
[1801.48 → 1802.46] Usually I make it through.
[1802.56 → 1804.60] Like, I'm sitting at 28% today, though.
[1804.88 → 1808.20] But I have used it fairly heavily with GPS and all that kind of noise.
[1810.14 → 1814.34] Wow, I feel like I've been talking a mile a minute on this stream.
[1814.38 → 1816.12] But apparently you guys like that.
[1816.18 → 1818.42] We have 6,400 viewers.
[1819.14 → 1820.48] What is going on?
[1820.66 → 1822.40] We are halfway through the show.
[1823.42 → 1825.28] That is absolutely incredible.
[1825.28 → 1830.14] Now I don't want to screw it up and talk about, like, some kind of boring topic like,
[1830.40 → 1833.26] Let's play What's on the Desk here at the NCI Studio.
[1835.80 → 1836.58] Here we go.
[1837.12 → 1838.06] Oh, look at that.
[1838.54 → 1842.70] We've got an Intel 750 Series 1.2TB SSD just sitting here.
[1844.28 → 1850.06] We've got another Intel 750 Series 1.2TB SSD, this time in a 2.5-inch form factor.
[1850.06 → 1853.88] Nope, nope, Jack, that's cheating.
[1854.18 → 1856.34] I'm not taking your McDonald's Happy Meal nonsense.
[1856.52 → 1858.28] I'm only things that are within my reach.
[1858.70 → 1860.72] We've got a four-way SLI bridge.
[1864.28 → 1867.10] Ah, a random cheapo IO shield.
[1868.78 → 1869.24] Uh-huh.
[1869.40 → 1869.72] Yeah.
[1869.84 → 1870.76] What else we got here?
[1871.36 → 1873.68] Oh, is this under NDA?
[1873.68 → 1876.32] What is this?
[1877.04 → 1878.22] It's a practical node 202.
[1878.40 → 1879.74] Node 202, are you sure?
[1881.80 → 1883.72] Oh, oh, is there a computer in there?
[1885.16 → 1886.40] Nope, just a power supply.
[1886.56 → 1887.14] I'm just weak.
[1887.66 → 1888.88] Oh, well, that's disappointing.
[1889.14 → 1890.38] So I guess we've got one of these.
[1892.10 → 1897.34] It's funny because I had a call with someone today where I was told not to publish my review yet.
[1897.34 → 1904.60] So whose fault is it then if we break an NDA on my show with your review sample?
[1905.12 → 1905.62] Your fault.
[1905.86 → 1907.08] I think you know the answer to that.
[1907.10 → 1911.82] Yeah, I think it's probably my show that's going to take the fall for this one.
[1912.06 → 1913.56] Oh, is this the curved one?
[1914.14 → 1914.90] No, that's the flat one.
[1914.98 → 1915.74] Oh, that's the flat one.
[1915.76 → 1916.44] I can't tell.
[1916.68 → 1922.52] I thought it was a Samsung curved 24-inch monitor, but it turned out it was actually a Samsung flat 24-inch monitor.
[1922.52 → 1928.00] That 24-inch, the whole curved thing doesn't make a whole ton of sense to me personally.
[1928.46 → 1930.20] All right, we don't have to play this game anymore.
[1930.28 → 1931.06] That was fun, though.
[1931.48 → 1933.30] Oh, actually, these are super handy.
[1933.40 → 1935.30] We are finally getting some of these in our studio.
[1935.88 → 1939.22] We're getting a bunch of clear ones for storage of things.
[1939.32 → 1940.08] Oh, here's the curved one.
[1942.04 → 1943.16] Look, a curved monitor.
[1944.12 → 1946.74] It's curved, which is good.
[1947.22 → 1948.40] At least that's what I tell her.
[1952.02 → 1952.38] Yep.
[1952.80 → 1953.80] Curved for her pleasure.
[1954.06 → 1959.30] Mind you, I'm pretty sure that depends on the direction of the curve and, like, the position at the time.
[1960.10 → 1969.06] Because, like, you know, like a 180-degree turn, you know, from certain angles might actually be quite uncomfortable.
[1970.26 → 1972.50] Oh, look, I haven't managed to scare off that many of you.
[1972.50 → 1979.02] I was going to see if I just go off on a completely stupid tangent how many of you are going to hate me forever and tune out.
[1979.44 → 1981.64] Wow, seriously, thank you guys for tuning in any way.
[1981.64 → 1983.42] Let's move on to our next topic today.
[1985.42 → 1992.92] Intel reportedly delays their 10 nanometre mass production due to poor yields.
[1992.92 → 1997.80] So let's go ahead and post the link to the forum here.
[1998.20 → 1998.64] All right.
[1998.70 → 2002.58] Let's go ahead and pull the article up on Ars Technica here.
[2003.70 → 2004.34] All right.
[2004.34 → 2012.54] Intel confirms TikTok shattering Kaby Lake processor as Moore's law falters.
[2012.54 → 2021.12] So the company will make three generations of 14 nanometre processors, delaying the switch to 10 nanometers.
[2021.40 → 2022.22] And you know what?
[2022.54 → 2026.18] It might not necessarily be the end of the world.
[2026.54 → 2029.46] I mean, you look at what NVIDIA has managed to do.
[2029.46 → 2034.58] Stuck on 28 nanometers for a freaking dog's age.
[2034.58 → 2036.58] I mean, think about that for a second.
[2036.86 → 2048.94] Look at the improvements we saw in efficiency as well as performance going from Kepler to Maxwell in spite of the fact that they were stuck on the same manufacturing process node.
[2048.94 → 2066.28] Maybe the engineers at Intel can pull, you know, magic duck out of their hats and turn this into a positive, an opportunity to optimize their 14 nanometre processors in a way that maybe they didn't think about before because they were just relying on process node shrinks.
[2066.28 → 2068.42] Or maybe none of that will happen.
[2068.42 → 2085.66] I mean, what I would love to see happen, you know, we've seen a lot of bad news out of Intel in the last few weeks here, whether it's the job cuts or whether it's the, you know, the stagnant desktop processor sales leading to, you know, an earnings shortfall prediction, like that kind of stuff.
[2086.38 → 2095.16] Maybe what this will do is be a bit of a, you know, wake up and smell the coffee call for them to really innovate in terms of performance.
[2095.16 → 2098.34] Because we've seen them innovate in a lot of ways.
[2098.34 → 2108.10] Like, let's face it, as much as enthusiasts might not get, you know, excited about 10 watts of better, you know, power savings or whatever.
[2108.70 → 2122.98] The thing that we enthusiasts need to realize is that if Intel can build that, that means that they could probably build a more complex, higher performance chip that consumed a similar amount of power.
[2122.98 → 2125.30] Even if it's not, you know, double the performance.
[2125.42 → 2135.18] Hey, I would take a, you know, 30%, you know, generation over generation performance improvement like we used to see sometimes in an absolute freaking heartbeat.
[2135.18 → 2149.18] So I would love to see Intel find a way to capture the hearts of the enthusiasts and not just the minds by, you know, maybe dialling back all the graphics on board of an enthusiast grade CPU.
[2149.44 → 2152.68] Maybe dialling up the single threaded performance.
[2153.40 → 2162.92] Would love to see them just kind of take a look, take a long hard look at where they're heading and figure out if it's exactly the right direction.
[2162.92 → 2175.18] And, you know, I hate to do this, but AMD did their earnings call Q2 2015.
[2175.50 → 2175.76] Hold on.
[2176.00 → 2180.78] I don't actually have this in the doc here, but edited transcript, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2180.88 → 2181.38] Dang it.
[2181.96 → 2183.78] Did anyone do an article?
[2184.74 → 2185.90] Yeah, revenue falls again.
[2186.16 → 2187.20] This and this and this.
[2187.72 → 2188.38] Blah, blah, blah.
[2188.68 → 2189.36] Let's see.
[2189.58 → 2190.22] Blah, blah, blah.
[2190.58 → 2191.92] Zen, whatever, et cetera.
[2191.92 → 2195.06] Okay, so crap.
[2195.18 → 2195.90] I can't find it.
[2195.98 → 2202.08] I actually talked about it on Net link Daily today, but AMD has, can you remind me, what was it?
[2202.12 → 2205.90] They're going 10 nanometers in 2017 or something like that.
[2205.98 → 2206.80] No, they've taped out.
[2207.18 → 2208.28] They taped out what?
[2209.44 → 2215.86] Okay, AMD's first FinFET processor has taped out, which means we actually could be closer than we thought.
[2215.96 → 2217.92] So that was one of the things they covered on their earnings call.
[2217.92 → 2237.80] This is a huge opportunity with, because you've got to understand, guys, if Intel decides to build like a consumer grade, you know, like a, like a, you know, like a something 770K processor with more of an emphasis on CPU and less emphasis on GPU and power savings and blah, blah, blah.
[2237.80 → 2238.80] That takes years.
[2238.80 → 2239.30] That takes years.
[2239.40 → 2240.76] It takes years to turn that around.
[2240.76 → 2255.38] So if AMD is already, you know, waist deep in the development process of Zen and Zen turns out to be a success, man, we could see another, you know, golden year or golden two years out of AMD on the CPU side.
[2255.38 → 2259.68] And we could see like some legitimate reasons for an enthusiast to buy an AMD CPU.
[2260.02 → 2261.94] I really hope for this for two reasons.
[2262.08 → 2268.70] Number one, you know, I put an AMD CPU, a lot of people call me a fanboy.
[2268.94 → 2271.76] They'll call me an Intel fanboy or an Nvidia fanboy.
[2271.76 → 2278.20] And something I'd like you guys to understand is that AMD will always hold an ATI for that matter.
[2278.30 → 2283.04] AMD will always hold a very special place in my heart, even though they absorbed ATI.
[2283.20 → 2287.80] Although funny thing is AMD's worth, I think it was something like a quarter of what they paid for ATI today.
[2288.00 → 2296.78] Anyway, they'll always hold a special, a special place in my heart because the very first computer I built for myself, AMD processor, guys.
[2297.62 → 2301.66] Barton 2500 plus, my friends overclocked the snot out of that thing.
[2301.96 → 2308.64] Made it 3200 plus equivalent, which I told myself at the time because let's face it, when I was young, I was a bit of a fanboy.
[2308.92 → 2317.42] I told myself at the time that that was somehow equivalent to a 3.2 gigahertz, you know, P4C, which, come on, come on, AMD fans.
[2317.42 → 2320.08] Let's be honest with ourselves for a second here.
[2320.66 → 2326.66] The performance rating system was dead, was dead long before the P4C launched.
[2326.66 → 2338.38] Pentium 4B was not that equivalent to AMD's PR or, you know, press release or public relations or performance rating, whatever they wanted to call that system.
[2338.38 → 2348.90] And actually, the first add-in graphics card I ever bought, ATI, my friends, 9600 All in Wonder Pro.
[2349.86 → 2350.38] Bam.
[2350.38 → 2361.56] So, you know, I'd love to see a return to the glory days there, even if, you know, I've been disappointed time and time and time and time and time again, with the latest being the Fury X.
[2361.76 → 2364.08] And, you know, AMD does it to themselves, guys.
[2364.20 → 2365.82] They build up this hype train.
[2366.32 → 2369.62] They build up this hype train and then they under-deliver.
[2369.62 → 2373.56] And, you know, the fact of the matter is I can't help myself as an enthusiast.
[2373.62 → 2374.92] I just want to see fast hardware.
[2375.50 → 2378.66] Like, I'm not that focused on what brand makes it these days.
[2378.76 → 2379.74] I couldn't care less.
[2379.78 → 2382.00] I just want to make it go fast, you know what I mean?
[2382.30 → 2393.80] And I still have some hope for this 19-centimeter Fury-based card that's apparently going to be launching sometime in mid-August.
[2393.80 → 2400.76] I don't know if I actually have an article here in the doc for that one, but that was just something that I was reading about.
[2401.16 → 2405.56] So, I think I just completely broke the document.
[2405.84 → 2408.26] And, oh, that is so nice.
[2408.76 → 2415.76] Ghost, who deserves a shout-out because he does so much behind the scenes for the WAN show.
[2415.86 → 2417.66] Member of the Linus Tech Tips community, Ghost.
[2417.96 → 2422.86] He actually fixed me overwriting a bunch of crap in the doc while I was looking at it.
[2422.86 → 2424.70] He helps flesh out the topics.
[2425.08 → 2431.24] He coordinates the folks who put together the timestamps and sends that to me so I can go ahead and get that posted for you guys.
[2431.80 → 2432.72] And look at this.
[2433.00 → 2436.06] Has added the Kit Guru article that I'll go ahead.
[2436.12 → 2437.60] I'll post this in the Twitch chat here.
[2438.72 → 2439.12] Boom.
[2439.54 → 2443.10] And I'll go ahead and pull this up here about AMD's FinFET.
[2443.20 → 2443.40] Whoops.
[2443.78 → 2446.96] I keep clicking the wrong thing because I've set up my scenes differently.
[2447.58 → 2451.18] AMD, we have taped out our first FinFET product.
[2451.18 → 2454.30] First couple of FinFET designs.
[2454.44 → 2456.24] Blip pity-bloppity, et cetera, et cetera.
[2458.02 → 2459.42] Needed for production, et cetera.
[2459.60 → 2463.20] So, tape out is the final stage of the design cycle of an integrated circuit.
[2463.52 → 2467.32] The point at which the artwork of the IC is sent to the maker of photo masks.
[2467.52 → 2467.68] Okay.
[2467.68 → 2475.96] So, once the set of photo masks is made and verified, it is sent to a contract manufacturer for the chip, which produces the first working samples of the chip.
[2476.04 → 2479.70] So, they should get their first samples sometime in September.
[2479.70 → 2482.08] Very exciting stuff.
[2482.18 → 2484.74] And hopefully, they're headed in the right direction here.
[2485.64 → 2485.98] All right.
[2486.00 → 2486.68] What else we got here?
[2486.76 → 2488.82] Oh, speaking of ball and processors.
[2488.82 → 2496.88] As much as Intel hasn't delivered much for gamers to wet their parties over in the last few generations here,
[2497.54 → 2506.06] this is going to get some server and high-performance computing folks pretty freaking excited here.
[2506.06 → 2522.26] So, original article here is from Kid Guru, Intel's 28 core Leon codename Skylike CPUs to support 6 terabytes of RAM on an LGA 3467 form factor
[2522.26 → 2533.02] with a rumoured 6-channel built-in memory controller and support for up to 8 CPUs on a single motherboard.
[2533.94 → 2534.42] Yes.
[2534.82 → 2541.26] The Pearly platform will be Intel's biggest server platform advancement in many years.
[2541.38 → 2543.64] When it's rolled out, okay, no time soon.
[2543.74 → 2547.22] Unfortunately, it's not going to be rolling out until 2017.
[2547.22 → 2554.30] And that assumes everything stays on schedule, which, as you guys know, is not always the case.
[2554.48 → 2561.54] But it's going to use a new bus called UPI, operating at 10 gigatransfers per second.
[2562.02 → 2571.78] And Eons themselves will have built-in 10 gigabit Ethernet and or 100 gigabits per second Omni Path integrated onto the Dais.
[2571.78 → 2576.30] Now, that is some useful technology to start building on DAI.
[2577.22 → 2586.40] Because, I mean, I don't know if some of the younger folks are going to know this, but on Intel chipsets for years and years and years,
[2586.48 → 2594.48] like, remember when we, in the early days of gigabit, remember when it was, like, really rare, like, practically unheard of
[2594.48 → 2598.58] to have an Intel gigabit network chipset built into your motherboard?
[2598.84 → 2599.94] A lot of people don't know this.
[2600.08 → 2601.02] It was all on there.
[2601.14 → 2602.36] It was on there all that time.
[2602.78 → 2604.86] Intel chipsets had gigabit LAN on them.
[2604.86 → 2611.72] It was actually a licensing fee that the motherboard maker had to pay to Intel in order to activate it.
[2612.18 → 2613.78] So wrap your brain around this for a second.
[2614.22 → 2622.90] It was cheaper for the motherboard maker to buy a chipset from Related or Marvell or whoever the case may be,
[2623.24 → 2628.14] and put that physical chip on the motherboard, increasing the complexity of the PCB,
[2628.14 → 2634.20] not to mention buying another chip, than it was to just unlock the gigabit Ethernet that was on board.
[2635.18 → 2635.78] So, yeah.
[2635.96 → 2637.62] So more Intel Ethernet.
[2637.70 → 2640.72] I don't know if Intel has adjusted their pricing structures or whatever's happened,
[2640.80 → 2642.52] but we've seen a lot more Intel Ethernet lately.
[2642.96 → 2645.42] And moving that on DAI is only going to...
[2645.42 → 2646.04] Wow.
[2646.14 → 2646.52] Excuse me.
[2646.58 → 2647.44] That snuck up on me.
[2647.52 → 2648.00] That was rude.
[2648.00 → 2653.18] It's only going to be a good thing, especially as network speeds ramp up
[2653.18 → 2658.42] and latency becomes much more important to go along with the massive bandwidth
[2658.42 → 2660.82] that we're going to need in order to achieve, you know,
[2660.94 → 2665.14] 100 gigabit per second connections and all that kind of nonsense.
[2666.50 → 2670.12] This is definitely the day's most hilarious piece of news.
[2670.94 → 2676.62] Apple is getting sued over the name watch, even though that's not what their product is called.
[2676.62 → 2679.14] So, let's go ahead and test this.
[2680.96 → 2681.52] watch.
[2682.68 → 2683.70] Look at that.
[2684.02 → 2686.24] The first search result is Apple.
[2687.28 → 2693.90] The next search result is European lawsuit over watch name shows why Apple had to choose Apple Watch.
[2694.20 → 2699.96] That's a hilarious thing because I definitely did wonder why they went with Apple Watch instead of watch.
[2700.58 → 2705.70] Okay, there's 9 to 5 Mac slash watch, the European trademark holders filed a lawsuit.
[2705.70 → 2706.94] Apple's getting sued.
[2707.14 → 2707.72] It's so funny.
[2707.82 → 2709.30] The power of Apple.
[2709.98 → 2714.92] Even if they don't call it something, it still completely dominates the headlines.
[2715.84 → 2718.86] So, anyway, what their butt hurt about.
[2718.94 → 2722.20] So, it's an Irish company that owns the watch trademark in Europe.
[2722.20 → 2732.86] is upset that Apple paid to put Apple Watch ads on Google for the search term watch, which I can totally understand why they did.
[2732.96 → 2734.20] I mean, let's face it.
[2734.20 → 2741.48] You're an average consumer who's not, you know, hanging on to, you know, Joni Ives every word.
[2741.48 → 2753.20] You're going to probably think it's called the watch because that's what, like, Apple stuff that goes in your pocket or, you know, on your wrist if you had one of those tricked out iPod Naxos.
[2753.92 → 2756.30] That's what Apple portable devices are called.
[2756.68 → 2762.80] So, for people to go and search on Google for watch and expect to get an Apple Watch is a perfectly reasonable thing.
[2762.80 → 2768.52] So, for Apple to take advantage of that and convert those people to sales makes a ton of sense.
[2770.94 → 2781.02] So, yeah, but I can also understand, you know, why this particular trademark, you know, upset is going on here.
[2781.14 → 2786.60] So, apparently, the Europe watch trademark is valued at 87 million euros.
[2786.60 → 2792.92] And Google is evaluating the trademark complaint, which apparently they do, on a case-by-case basis.
[2793.26 → 2796.26] So, it wouldn't be the first time this has ever happened, thanks, Ghost.
[2796.64 → 2803.78] In 2012, Apple actually paid 60 million to settle a trademark dispute in China over rights to use the name iPad.
[2805.12 → 2805.48] Hmm.
[2805.80 → 2808.14] I should start trademarking Apple things.
[2808.38 → 2810.80] I've been predicting for a long time home.
[2811.38 → 2812.86] I should trademark home.
[2812.86 → 2821.04] I think Apple is going to do, like, completely pre-packaged homes that are just fully automated and integrated with all of Apple's services and everything.
[2822.20 → 2822.76] The home?
[2827.50 → 2828.60] It's called an home?
[2828.86 → 2829.80] Oh, that's lame.
[2829.88 → 2830.78] Well, house then.
[2831.38 → 2831.82] Bam!
[2832.38 → 2833.18] domicile.
[2833.74 → 2834.62] residence.
[2835.60 → 2836.34] structure.
[2838.94 → 2839.74] All right.
[2839.74 → 2841.84] Oh, we should do sponsor spots, right?
[2842.12 → 2842.84] Sponsors today.
[2842.86 → 2844.20] Dollar Shave Club.
[2844.60 → 2850.54] If you don't know what Dollar Shave Club is, you can visit dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus, because I can't be arsed to tell you about it.
[2850.88 → 2851.54] No, I'm just kidding.
[2851.64 → 2852.12] I'm just kidding.
[2852.38 → 2854.26] I hope no one from Dollar Shave Club is watching this.
[2854.58 → 2860.22] Dollar Shave Club is the service that gets you high-quality razors delivered directly to your door for only a few bucks a month.
[2860.22 → 2861.48] You can get anything from their basic Dollar Shave Club.
[2861.48 → 2869.68] You can get anything from their basic Dollar Shave Club razor, which, you know, you take the hairs off your face with, to the executive six-blade razor that you also take the hairs off your face with.
[2869.68 → 2873.14] But feel like an executive while you use it.
[2873.14 → 2881.74] They've also got other bathroom supplies, like their aftershave, their Dr. Carver's shave butter, which goes on clear so you can see what you're doing.
[2881.88 → 2885.28] And their one-wipe Charlie's Peppermint-scented butt wipes for men.
[2885.28 → 2896.16] Let's face it, if you've ever changed a baby's diaper, you know, a dry wipe does not work as well as a wet wipe, and a peppermint-scented butthole is the kind of butthole I want to have.
[2896.16 → 2902.96] So that's dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus to join the club and start shaving time and shaving money.
[2903.60 → 2906.66] Also sponsored today, do you guys have an fixity toolkit?
[2908.02 → 2912.24] Uh, I just bought one, and then I actually bought one on Mass drop.
[2912.92 → 2914.06] You guys bought one on Mass drop?
[2914.06 → 2915.74] Oh, really? Do you have it here?
[2916.28 → 2919.16] Mine's not sent home, but I think you have it.
[2919.26 → 2920.44] Oh, but it's over at the other...
[2920.44 → 2921.28] Oh, okay. Well, that's okay.
[2921.32 → 2925.62] I'm just doing a sponsorship spot for fixity, so I figured if I could hold one up, that would be great.
[2925.68 → 2926.98] I don't have mine in my backpack today.
[2927.08 → 2933.28] But, guys, the fixity Protect Toolkit is winner-winner-chicken-dinner.
[2933.46 → 2935.12] It is absolutely fantastic.
[2935.58 → 2942.04] It's got all kinds of little useful things that you can use the guides on iFixit.com
[2942.04 → 2948.74] in order to follow along and repair your electronics and all that kind of good stuff.
[2949.10 → 2953.22] So let's go ahead and find out what all of my talking points are supposed to be for fixity
[2953.22 → 2958.42] because I don't really know what to say other than that they've got not only their fantastic guides,
[2958.52 → 2959.92] but also fantastic tools.
[2959.92 → 2967.54] I've used fixity tools for, dear lord, pretty much any piece of electronics that I have disassembled
[2967.54 → 2971.30] or repaired ever since I first ordered a Protect Toolkit.
[2972.04 → 2972.48] Wow.
[2972.92 → 2976.14] It was about two and a half years ago that I got my first Protect Toolkit.
[2976.40 → 2978.28] So I'm talking the iMac.
[2978.52 → 2979.74] I'm talking the MacBook.
[2980.04 → 2982.08] I'm talking cell phone repair.
[2982.24 → 2983.26] Whatever the case may be.
[2983.34 → 2984.06] They've got Torn.
[2984.14 → 2984.96] They've got Training.
[2984.96 → 2986.44] I took apart a DS with it.
[2986.82 → 2993.64] And if you use offer code WINSLOW, you can save $10 on a purchase of $50 or more
[2993.64 → 2996.10] and get your own Protect Toolkit today.
[2996.28 → 2998.10] And it doesn't just end at the Protect Toolkit.
[2998.16 → 2999.56] They've got all kinds of great stuff there.
[2999.62 → 3000.42] Like when I put the...
[3000.42 → 3005.60] When I took the iMac apart, I didn't realize until I read their disassembly and reassembly guide
[3005.60 → 3010.24] that you actually have to get replacement adhesive strips and all kinds of crap like that.
[3010.32 → 3012.18] So they stock all that stuff as well.
[3012.18 → 3014.80] They stock like the little wheel for cutting.
[3014.90 → 3015.72] It actually comes in a kit.
[3015.80 → 3017.58] You get a wheel for cutting the adhesive strips.
[3017.78 → 3020.12] And then you get new adhesive strips to put it back together.
[3020.20 → 3022.28] And it looks just like factory new.
[3022.40 → 3026.12] So we love fixity tools around here at Linus Tech Tips.
[3026.54 → 3030.18] And we definitely recommend picking one up if you haven't already.
[3031.70 → 3036.22] Speaking of picking things up if you haven't already, let's go ahead and drop this link in the Twitch chat.
[3037.36 → 3037.88] Boom!
[3037.88 → 3039.80] Boeing patents.
[3040.42 → 3044.10] Laser-powered fusion fission jet engines.
[3044.54 → 3046.62] Yes, that is as complicated as it sounds.
[3046.98 → 3051.24] So naturally, the original source here for the article is Ars Technica.
[3051.34 → 3057.72] These guys do such a great job of the highly technical topics because I'm going to confess to you guys,
[3057.72 → 3066.64] I am not some kind of physicist here, and I am not going to be able to explain to you exactly how the crap this works.
[3067.16 → 3069.14] But essentially, there you go.
[3069.36 → 3070.98] That is a diagram of the patent.
[3071.06 → 3078.68] Now, to be clear, we are nowhere near fission being useful for pushing planes around yet.
[3078.68 → 3085.14] But they're patenting the concept once the technology advances to the point where they could build something like this.
[3085.20 → 3088.26] They're just sort of saying theoretically like they could.
[3088.78 → 3096.04] So basically, the way that it works is they are going to shoot lasers at deuterium and tritium.
[3096.04 → 3100.84] So that's heavy hydrogen inside the engine, causing the atoms to fuse.
[3101.44 → 3101.56] Okay?
[3102.98 → 3110.16] So then gas from the fusion reaction would then be pushed out the back of the engine, creating thrust.
[3110.16 → 3119.62] Leftover neutrons from the fusion bombard the inside of the engine, which is coated with fissionable uranium generating heat,
[3119.76 → 3125.32] which powers the lasers, helping it sustain itself as it goes.
[3125.40 → 3128.84] So fusion, remember guys, is combining atoms.
[3129.30 → 3130.86] Fission is breaking them apart.
[3130.98 → 3137.04] So fission is the one that we've harnessed at this point with fusion being the one that we still have a long way to go at.
[3137.04 → 3139.54] I might have actually screwed that up a moment ago.
[3139.66 → 3145.78] But the point is lasers and nuclear reactions tearing apart and combining atoms.
[3146.52 → 3147.00] Wow.
[3147.38 → 3151.26] Those should be some pretty badass jet engines.
[3153.22 → 3154.12] All right.
[3154.70 → 3156.38] What else do we got here today?
[3156.70 → 3158.00] T-Mobile has a new family plan.
[3158.08 → 3159.16] This is a pretty quick topic.
[3159.26 → 3160.60] Not a lot to really say about it.
[3160.60 → 3167.92] Other than that, T-Mobile continues to put the thumb screws on the other mobile carriers there.
[3168.04 → 3168.54] Oh, whoops.
[3168.66 → 3169.82] I'm looking at the wrong...
[3170.86 → 3171.50] Dang it.
[3173.26 → 3173.70] Wait.
[3173.82 → 3174.38] There should be...
[3174.38 → 3174.56] Yep.
[3175.20 → 3176.94] Ah, let's go with Android Authority today.
[3176.94 → 3186.36] So their plan is 10 gigabytes per line, which is pretty fantastic when you compare it to what the others are offering.
[3187.08 → 3190.66] And it's $120 for four lines.
[3190.90 → 3192.60] And it's pretty much unlimited everything.
[3192.76 → 3196.38] So it includes 10 gigs of 4G LTE data.
[3196.46 → 3199.18] Now you can say whatever you want about T-Mobile's coverage.
[3199.18 → 3206.04] And my first-hand experience with T-Mobile's network compared to AT&T has not been very favourable.
[3206.52 → 3226.38] With that said, every time we go down to the U.S., we all refill our T-Mobile pay-as-you-go Sims because for three bucks a day or whatever, for LTE, I think up to 100 legs of LTE data per day, as far as pay-as-you-go plans go, it is pretty freaking fantastic, especially compared to what we can get in Canada.
[3226.38 → 3229.78] So let me just have a look at what else is included here.
[3229.88 → 3231.66] 10 gigs per line, no sharing.
[3232.16 → 3235.98] And you can get 20 gigs for an extra $10 per month.
[3236.82 → 3238.16] Pretty awesome!
[3240.64 → 3241.34] All right.
[3241.38 → 3242.48] What do we get next here?
[3243.32 → 3244.30] Ah, yes.
[3244.42 → 3250.26] Microsoft CEO clarifies their mobile and Windows 10 strategy.
[3250.56 → 3251.56] So, oops.
[3251.84 → 3253.20] Original article here, guys.
[3253.24 → 3254.66] I'm going to pop that in the Twitch chat.
[3254.66 → 3256.50] Boom, here we go.
[3256.70 → 3257.98] And news items.
[3260.20 → 3264.94] All right, so it talks about his thinking around product differentiation and being ahead of the curve in this Q&A.
[3264.94 → 3268.64] You know, this is the first time.
[3271.38 → 3271.82] Wow.
[3272.02 → 3274.64] This is the first time since Windows CE.
[3274.64 → 3278.12] Just to kind of put it in perspective.
[3278.12 → 3290.80] That I've had some kind of hope that Microsoft knows what they're doing and could legitimately be a major player in the Windows mobile.
[3291.18 → 3295.14] So like Windows phones and Windows mobile-based tablets or whatever else.
[3295.24 → 3296.92] Whatever other products we see roll out.
[3296.92 → 3298.06] Especially phones.
[3298.06 → 3303.52] This is the first time that we've seen so many dramatic changes for the better at Microsoft.
[3303.84 → 3306.72] Like looking at how much feedback they're taking on Windows 10.
[3307.18 → 3312.00] You know, seeing people posting stories about how they submitted a bug report or a feature request.
[3312.00 → 3314.26] And it showed up in the next build.
[3314.36 → 3317.16] I mean, that kind of crap is amazing.
[3317.28 → 3319.84] That kind of transparent process is amazing.
[3320.46 → 3326.08] And so this is the first time in a long time that I've looked at Windows Phone and gone, maybe there's hope for this.
[3326.10 → 3328.84] Because there's a lot about Windows Phone that's good.
[3328.98 → 3331.36] I know that I've crapped on it a lot in the past.
[3331.44 → 3334.20] And I have good reason to crap on it.
[3334.20 → 3339.90] Because, let's face it, if you want to win me as a customer, it's ecosystem.
[3340.50 → 3344.98] Why is Apple so successful at charging so much for their phones?
[3346.00 → 3346.48] Ecosystem.
[3346.84 → 3347.80] How do they get away?
[3347.92 → 3351.54] Like, you look at the way they backpedalled on the iPhone 5C.
[3351.72 → 3355.46] They even dabbled in, okay, let's try having like a cheap option.
[3355.90 → 3363.12] And they got the crap out of there because they realized they were doing themselves no favours with a plastic, cheaper phone.
[3363.12 → 3366.78] No favours at all because their customers, they didn't want them anyway.
[3367.04 → 3370.36] They wanted to be part of that premium ecosystem.
[3370.90 → 3373.00] And so you have to sell me an ecosystem.
[3373.16 → 3386.02] And if I buy a new phone today, I expect to have a Sonos app, or I expect my, you know, Spotify or Google Play Music or whatever account to be able to beam to my wireless speakers in my house.
[3386.08 → 3387.78] Like, I expect all my crap to work.
[3387.78 → 3398.06] I don't want to be fighting with third-party apps that get broken with every other update of the OS or new hardware from the hardware manufacturer or whatever the case may be.
[3398.06 → 3402.94] But there are a lot of good things about Windows Phone.
[3403.04 → 3404.16] It's really responsive.
[3404.30 → 3406.30] It runs great on low-end hardware.
[3406.46 → 3418.00] I mean, seeing the way that Android can bog down even something as high-end as an S6 Active or something as high-end as a Droid Turbo is so disheartening.
[3418.08 → 3419.62] I mean, we're talking devices with three.
[3419.62 → 3424.84] We've got ones coming with four gigs of RAM on them, and it still can't handle this stuff okay.
[3425.26 → 3429.88] So I would be really excited to see Microsoft not leave the mobile market.
[3430.04 → 3431.00] And that has been clarified.
[3431.26 → 3433.62] They are not leaving the mobile market.
[3434.18 → 3436.82] The Surface is a product to show what the platform can do.
[3437.18 → 3441.46] And the reason people should make universal apps is that they will be on Windows Desktop.
[3442.26 → 3445.72] HoloLens is apparently also made to be used in business, not just gaming.
[3445.82 → 3448.18] So these are a couple of sorts of pressing concerns.
[3448.18 → 3452.50] No, they're not leaving mobile, which is pretty freaking smurf.
[3453.06 → 3457.44] It's a little disappointing that Windows RT isn't going to be getting an update to Windows 10.
[3458.10 → 3461.54] You know, I'm sure that as disappointed as...
[3461.54 → 3471.58] Yeah, if people who bought Surface RTs weren't already, you know, buried in disappoint, that's just kind of the final nail in the coffin.
[3472.00 → 3473.80] But, yeah.
[3475.62 → 3476.10] Bummer.
[3476.10 → 3478.36] I guess there's nothing we can really do about it now.
[3478.48 → 3481.36] So let's go ahead and pop up our next topic here.
[3482.64 → 3483.52] Uppity bop pity.
[3484.30 → 3490.06] Woman changes her name to get control of Facebook accounts.
[3490.12 → 3493.56] So the original article here is from independent.co.uk.
[3493.70 → 3494.00] Oh, wow.
[3494.08 → 3494.24] Sorry.
[3494.32 → 3497.10] I had my sidebar running that whole time there.
[3497.16 → 3497.56] Sorry, guys.
[3497.56 → 3504.62] So a London woman has to change name by deed poll to log in to Facebook.
[3504.98 → 3511.02] I can't believe I'm stuck with this stupid name and still can't get into my Facebook.
[3511.56 → 3512.94] Freaking hilarious.
[3513.16 → 3514.24] So a little bit of background here.
[3514.24 → 3518.54] So set up account with a fake name back in 2008.
[3518.92 → 3522.92] I mean, I've struggled with this kind of stuff in the past before, too.
[3522.98 → 3532.76] Like the way that, you know, Google locks down your YouTube username or your Google Plus username to the point where it's like, why can't I change my YouTube username?
[3532.76 → 3536.86] What if I go from, you know, being a tech channel and I have like Linus Tech Tips?
[3537.08 → 3538.64] What if I want to start vlogging?
[3539.32 → 3541.76] Like, is that not a thing that I'm allowed to do?
[3541.82 → 3543.36] I'm not going to start vlogging anytime soon.
[3543.60 → 3548.82] But the way that we get like these arbitrary decisions that never used to matter.
[3548.96 → 3554.30] Like you used to just go, oh, yeah, I'll create a new Hotmail account for, you know, whatever flavour of the month, stupid.
[3554.40 → 3557.76] Moo, Moo the cow at Hotmail.com or whatever, right?
[3557.82 → 3559.08] Like you didn't really think about it.
[3559.08 → 3563.68] All of a sudden, these things are catching up to us, you know, seven years later.
[3563.98 → 3566.84] So the Facebook Terms of Service requires you to use a real name.
[3566.92 → 3572.96] So to be able to regain access to her locked account, she changed her name on credit cards.
[3572.96 → 3574.34] That was not enough.
[3574.82 → 3580.64] So she officially changed her name via Deed Poll to regain access to her account.
[3581.20 → 3583.12] Absolutely edentulous.
[3583.12 → 3589.92] And speaking of edentulous, I guess this will actually be the official statement.
[3590.30 → 3593.60] This will actually be the last article for the day.
[3593.96 → 3598.20] And this news item comes right off of Thermaltake.com.
[3598.50 → 3602.50] I think you guys probably already know what I'm referring to.
[3602.50 → 3610.22] What I'm referring to if you've been following the whole thermal fake fiasco that went on around the Computer time frame
[3610.22 → 3615.26] with Case Labs calling out Thermal take as ripping off their design.
[3615.74 → 3617.40] So this is a press release from yesterday.
[3617.94 → 3620.28] Case Labs, and it's right on the Thermal take website.
[3620.40 → 3623.28] Boy, are they proud of this because they said almost nothing.
[3623.44 → 3627.16] Like, mum was the freaking word when this whole thing was going down.
[3627.72 → 3632.58] Case Labs apologizes for accusations against Thermal take.
[3632.58 → 3640.52] So Case Labs has issued a letter of retraction and apology for its recent attacks upon competitor Thermal take,
[3640.84 → 3644.48] another manufacturer of computer cases and other computer components.
[3645.18 → 3650.26] Recently, some of their personnel, including blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, posted attacks upon Thermal take.
[3650.52 → 3656.70] These attacks have included accusations that Thermal take and one of its employees, Shannon Robb,
[3656.70 → 3657.84] which is a real bummer.
[3657.84 → 3658.46] I like Shannon.
[3658.56 → 3659.28] He's a nice guy.
[3659.70 → 3663.12] Stole Case Labs' design and engaged in unfair competition.
[3663.48 → 3668.06] Case Labs now regrets those statements and apologizes for making them.
[3668.74 → 3669.22] Wow.
[3669.44 → 3676.76] How much more, like how much deeper could the bad blood run between Case Labs and Thermal take?
[3676.76 → 3679.90] I'm guessing lawyers were involved in this whole process,
[3679.90 → 3688.00] and I'm guessing that Case Labs with gritted teeth issued this particular apology
[3688.00 → 3695.32] because they certainly weren't happy about the whole, you know, Thermal take's designs looking,
[3695.90 → 3699.48] admittedly, very, very similar to some of Case Labs' designs.
[3699.54 → 3701.46] But we've covered this on the WAN Show before.
[3701.46 → 3712.86] The cold, hard truth of the matter is that there really isn't a lot that you can protect about the IP of something like a computer case.
[3713.48 → 3718.12] You know, like, look at Aztec's recent, what are they calling that, Signature S10?
[3718.84 → 3719.56] Is that what it's called?
[3719.62 → 3723.42] Yeah, you look at the Signature S10, which I actually saw for the first time in person today.
[3723.42 → 3729.76] You know, you can't patent, you know, crazy thick aluminum panels.
[3729.88 → 3733.64] If someone else decides that that's a good idea, which they probably won't,
[3734.44 → 3738.16] they can manufacture a case like that, and there's not really a lot you can do.
[3738.26 → 3740.30] I think Josh from Fractal put it best.
[3740.70 → 3747.54] There's only so many ways you can build a black box and, you know, have it not look, you know, the same as other black boxes.
[3747.54 → 3755.52] So I'm actually, for the first time in a very long time, completely out of topics for today.
[3756.08 → 3757.62] Why don't we do a Twitter Blitz?
[3758.40 → 3760.54] Yeah, yeah, let's do it.
[3760.82 → 3761.74] 10-minute Twitter Blitz.
[3762.06 → 3773.68] Over 7,200 live viewers on the WAN Show for this special edition broadcasting to you live from the NCI studio.
[3774.62 → 3775.66] So Twitter Blitz time.
[3775.66 → 3776.20] Here we go.
[3776.30 → 3776.90] Mentions.
[3777.54 → 3779.30] Wow.
[3779.60 → 3780.78] Not tech-related.
[3781.00 → 3782.48] Are you a fan of Game of Thrones?
[3783.06 → 3784.80] That is a great question.
[3785.24 → 3789.18] I read the first book and I loved it.
[3789.78 → 3794.52] I finished it after having bought the Kindle editions of the first five
[3794.52 → 3801.10] and realized after finishing it that George R.R. Martin hadn't written the last couple of books yet.
[3801.10 → 3805.72] I got super pissed off because I like to binge consume things,
[3805.72 → 3808.42] which is just, it's my way.
[3808.42 → 3809.36] I like to binge.
[3809.36 → 3816.88] And I vowed to not glance at the rest of those books that I have already paid for and will read at some point.
[3816.88 → 3821.26] I refuse to glance at them until I have read them all, or he dies.
[3821.26 → 3823.52] And I've read as many as exist.
[3823.52 → 3826.96] And I refuse to watch the show until I have read all the books.
[3826.96 → 3832.34] So I absolutely love Game of Thrones, but I'm mostly completely ignorant about it.
[3832.34 → 3834.00] So there you go.
[3834.00 → 3835.36] Funny question.
[3835.36 → 3836.40] Ask a funny question.
[3836.40 → 3837.24] Get a funny answer.
[3837.24 → 3840.76] Next car you plan on buying after the Civic kicks the bucket.
[3840.94 → 3843.22] Actually, I just bought a car.
[3843.90 → 3845.14] It's sitting out in the back.
[3845.22 → 3850.80] I bought my parents' old Suzuki XL7 because I needed something that could pull a trailer.
[3851.16 → 3853.22] And they were selling it for $4,000.
[3853.72 → 3861.62] It's like, I want to say it's a 2009 with 180,000 kilometres on it.
[3861.62 → 3867.28] That's in like, I know it's all highway kilometres because I know that they basically just drive up and down from the cabin in it.
[3867.28 → 3869.28] So I needed something that could haul a trailer.
[3869.64 → 3877.22] So I will be trying to sell the Civic to Easel or something because he just got his driver's license.
[3877.92 → 3879.78] So I don't know if I was supposed to break the news.
[3879.94 → 3881.78] Easel finally has a driver's license.
[3882.06 → 3886.86] I think a big part of it was that our new office is not very accessible via transit.
[3887.50 → 3889.86] So Terran's solution was to move in.
[3889.94 → 3891.36] And this is horrible.
[3891.96 → 3898.52] So Terran's solution was to move into a new place really close to the new office, but not that close to the old office.
[3898.72 → 3902.18] And then the construction project got delayed by like three months.
[3902.40 → 3909.68] So he's been riding his bike 45 minutes each way for like months, thinking that we were moving in like a month.
[3910.50 → 3912.56] So Easel has gone ahead and bought a car.
[3915.84 → 3917.12] Okay, next question.
[3917.44 → 3918.54] Over 7,000 viewers.
[3918.88 → 3919.06] Woo!
[3919.72 → 3920.96] Yeah, that's not really a question.
[3921.62 → 3923.00] Watching the WAN show.
[3923.16 → 3925.74] Also not a question, but thank you for the shout-out, JD.
[3926.74 → 3927.74] Tom Hutchinson.
[3928.00 → 3928.48] Hutchison.
[3928.62 → 3929.04] Hutchison?
[3929.38 → 3932.32] A peppermint scented butthole is the kind of butthole I want.
[3933.06 → 3933.86] Yes, it is.
[3933.86 → 3938.34] My question is why is your background that colour?
[3938.34 → 3941.18] Because I am in a strange and foreign land.
[3941.18 → 3942.42] All right.
[3942.42 → 3944.60] All right.
[3944.60 → 3949.64] Why is getting a shirt from Canada so much more expensive than normal?
[3949.82 → 3951.16] Already have three of your shirts.
[3951.56 → 3954.04] Because Canada is Canada.
[3954.04 → 3955.90] And shipping is really expensive.
[3955.90 → 3957.82] We're used to being bent over on shipping.
[3957.82 → 3962.70] Whether we have to ship something somewhere else or whether we have to pay for shipping for someone else to send it to us.
[3962.82 → 3967.62] Unless it's coming from like Hong Kong where the government is subsidizing shipping.
[3967.62 → 3971.74] It costs a lot of money to ship into or out of Canada.
[3972.54 → 3974.32] Cooper asks, how did you get into IT?
[3974.60 → 3977.70] Reading forums and participating on forums, believe it or not.
[3978.44 → 3979.70] Daniel asks, how's it going?
[3980.08 → 3981.32] Pretty darn good, Daniel.
[3981.66 → 3982.48] Pretty darn good.
[3983.04 → 3985.16] Brianne asks, when are you making more cat videos?
[3985.26 → 3988.36] I actually don't have any cat videos on the plan.
[3988.82 → 3991.90] My cats, the second I turn on the camera, they're like my kids.
[3992.32 → 3994.30] They'll be doing something like super cute and funny.
[3994.38 → 3997.20] And then I'll be like, okay, please keep doing that.
[3997.42 → 3999.76] And it's like the second I pull out the camera, they stop.
[3999.86 → 4000.86] So it's just like, you know what?
[4000.94 → 4001.72] Screw you, cat.
[4002.14 → 4003.44] You don't get to be internet famous.
[4004.02 → 4004.26] Yeah.
[4004.94 → 4005.88] Yeah, you missed your shot.
[4006.34 → 4007.12] You had your shot.
[4007.12 → 4012.76] And you lose yourself at the moment, the moment you lose it, you want it.
[4012.82 → 4013.92] You better never let that go.
[4014.00 → 4015.04] Yeah, that's what I said.
[4015.64 → 4015.94] All right.
[4016.02 → 4018.58] AJ says, I have a business offer for you.
[4018.66 → 4019.92] Will you pay for the transport?
[4021.38 → 4022.76] I have no idea what you're talking about, man.
[4023.14 → 4025.66] Here's a question from my engineering teacher.
[4026.36 → 4030.18] Isn't VR headsets making people feel nauseated a good thing?
[4030.30 → 4031.52] As in, is it immersive?
[4032.30 → 4034.54] No, that's a terrible, terrible thing.
[4034.54 → 4038.92] Because nausea is not reality.
[4039.56 → 4043.50] So virtual reality shouldn't be nauseating.
[4044.24 → 4045.42] I hope that explained it.
[4046.04 → 4047.44] Any more build logs in the pipeline?
[4047.88 → 4048.32] Yes.
[4048.44 → 4050.16] I actually have some pretty cool stuff planned.
[4050.28 → 4053.50] So I'm going to be building a rig on the bottom of a desk.
[4053.62 → 4056.16] I have ordered all the mounting hardware that I need for that.
[4056.34 → 4058.70] It's going to be a pretty sick desk from Up Desk.
[4059.22 → 4061.30] So yeah, stay tuned for that one.
[4061.30 → 4068.56] I also heard from a little birdie that I'm going to be getting one of the first in existence.
[4070.40 → 4071.58] Oh, crap.
[4071.82 → 4073.84] I'm going to embarrass myself here.
[4074.66 → 4077.66] I only remember it as the Murder Box MK2.
[4077.76 → 4079.34] Ex form MK2.
[4079.48 → 4083.16] I will be doing a build log or a build guide in that.
[4083.60 → 4084.74] So stay tuned for that.
[4084.94 → 4086.52] Yes, things are happening.
[4086.80 → 4087.18] Oh, whoops.
[4087.26 → 4088.30] I'm in all the...
[4088.30 → 4089.78] You guys saw me have to Google that.
[4089.86 → 4090.74] Oh, dang it.
[4090.74 → 4094.04] There I thought I was buying myself time to give the answer.
[4094.32 → 4096.22] And you guys were watching me buy time.
[4097.06 → 4099.00] Keith asked why not sell the Civic to Terran?
[4099.40 → 4104.72] Because I don't believe Terran would be willing to drive any car other than a Toyota Camry.
[4105.20 → 4108.04] His father had a Camry, and it served his father well.
[4108.12 → 4109.48] Therefore, Terran wants a Camry.
[4110.02 → 4112.34] That, my friends, is Terran logic.
[4112.34 → 4115.24] This is what we have to work with around here.
[4116.68 → 4118.76] What do you think about Apus for budget gaming PCs?
[4118.92 → 4120.40] I think it's a perfect thing.
[4120.52 → 4125.50] Although, I think AMD's only got a generation or two left before Intel completely surpasses them at all budgets.
[4126.18 → 4128.62] Their latest onboard graphics are looking perfect.
[4128.62 → 4133.64] Z Biggie says, you should be sponsored by Dollar Beard Club.
[4133.88 → 4135.82] You know, I really don't know.
[4136.20 → 4143.26] I really don't know how that would go because Dollar Beard Club has no affiliation, to my knowledge, with Dollar Shave Club.
[4143.26 → 4147.98] And they kind of like, like, you can't patent, like, a shtick.
[4148.70 → 4154.48] But, like, Dollar Beard Club kind of ripped off Dollar Shave Club's shtick.
[4154.90 → 4156.78] And, like, I don't know.
[4156.82 → 4158.20] It seems kind of weird to me.
[4158.92 → 4162.42] The Divine Gamer asked for tips on an IT career similar to mine.
[4162.78 → 4164.64] What IT career is similar to mine?
[4166.54 → 4167.68] Who does this job?
[4167.84 → 4169.84] I'm not even sure I have an IT job.
[4169.84 → 4177.10] Like, the way that I see my job is, like, it's like I'm an entertainer.
[4177.22 → 4178.12] I'm an educator.
[4178.46 → 4181.74] I'm a business owner now.
[4181.96 → 4185.74] We have nine people working at Linus Media Group.
[4186.20 → 4191.60] Like, my job is, and sometimes, like, I really am String it up all day.
[4191.68 → 4199.52] Like, this week, I've gotten very little video stuff done because I've been busy working on our new workflow for video editing, which is only sort of IT stuff.
[4199.52 → 4201.42] That's like content creation stuff.
[4201.42 → 4216.38] And so I've been setting up virtual machines on the 36 core server, seeing if running multiple instances of Adobe Media Encoder with multiple watch folders can give us better efficiency than Sorenson's squeeze server and, like, trying all this different stuff.
[4216.46 → 4219.42] So, like, I do that stuff still sometimes.
[4219.42 → 4223.10] I don't even know what my job is half the time.
[4223.22 → 4224.70] I wear a lot of different hats.
[4225.72 → 4227.16] I don't really have a favourite APU.
[4227.54 → 4235.66] Yes, we are moving all of our workstations to Windows 10 as soon as we verified that Adobe Creative Cloud is going to run okay on Windows 10.
[4235.66 → 4240.98] I'm really excited about the whole fresh slate thing that's going to be going on at the new office.
[4241.28 → 4244.20] New organizational cabinets for all of our gear.
[4244.66 → 4249.68] You know, new, well-designed sets instead of just a pile of boxes behind me.
[4250.02 → 4253.00] You know, upgrading the workstations to Titan X's.
[4253.32 → 4254.20] That's going to be awesome.
[4254.60 → 4264.70] The new workflow with offloading footage, having it duplicated, having it replicated right when we offload so we don't have to leave stuff on SD cards and then not know whether it's safe to erase an SD card.
[4264.70 → 4266.24] Like, all of these things.
[4267.06 → 4270.38] Fresh Windows is going to be part of the fresh experience.
[4270.50 → 4271.22] I'm really excited.
[4273.02 → 4275.04] And the new, yeah, the new plate system.
[4275.28 → 4281.32] I actually just moved my personal workstation to Windows 10 as part of a personal rig update that's going to be coming on Vessel this weekend.
[4281.62 → 4286.76] So I installed the RTM, and then I'm going to, I just skipped the product key entry.
[4286.88 → 4292.60] So I'm just going to buy myself a product key as soon as, as soon as you can go buy one.
[4292.60 → 4295.20] Move-in date for the new office, Tom?
[4295.36 → 4297.14] Not 100% sure yet.
[4298.14 → 4298.98] Favourite food?
[4299.28 → 4300.72] Wow, good question.
[4302.40 → 4304.04] Really love my wife's pasta.
[4305.22 → 4306.60] Yeah, there we go.
[4307.54 → 4308.84] Where am I hiding, Luke?
[4309.44 → 4311.82] Ha, no, I couldn't hide Luke.
[4312.28 → 4314.18] Well, I could hide parts of Luke, if you know what I mean.
[4314.18 → 4317.88] But his whole self is up at a music festival.
[4318.10 → 4319.40] Oh, hold on a second.
[4319.92 → 4323.00] Oh, we just revealed something, I'm sure.
[4323.82 → 4324.88] So there you go.
[4325.00 → 4325.88] I just revealed.
[4326.02 → 4326.88] Oh, no, I didn't.
[4327.16 → 4330.96] I didn't reveal anything with that calendar pop-up.
[4331.82 → 4332.52] That's funny.
[4333.20 → 4333.48] Ha!
[4333.48 → 4339.46] So you can see that there's a Super Fun, if you look really closely over there.
[4339.58 → 4344.14] But you actually can't tell what it is, which is good, because I don't want to reveal what
[4344.14 → 4347.10] that Super Fun is going to be, because it's going to be super crazy fun.
[4348.08 → 4350.24] So let's do, let's go back to Twitter here.
[4351.10 → 4352.96] What is your favourite console, the Super Nintendo?
[4353.14 → 4355.72] Because it has the greatest game of all time, Final Fantasy VI.
[4355.72 → 4361.48] Would you say the Droid Turbo is still worth it?
[4362.04 → 4365.42] The camera is subpar, especially the launch time and the shutter speed.
[4365.52 → 4367.02] That's a big problem I have with the Droid Turbo.
[4367.18 → 4370.56] It did finally get a lollipop update, but that really doesn't bode well.
[4370.88 → 4376.28] The fact that it took so long to get 5.1 really doesn't bode well for future updates.
[4378.58 → 4380.32] I still love it for the battery life.
[4380.74 → 4383.40] And I do like the ergonomics better than the S6 Active.
[4383.40 → 4387.70] Stay tuned for my S6 Active review, because I will definitely be talking about S6 Active
[4387.70 → 4392.22] versus Droid Turbo, because they're really going to be trading blows in a lot of different ways.
[4393.66 → 4396.52] I think that's pretty much it for the show today, guys, actually.
[4396.62 → 4401.32] I think we're going to go ahead and just end...
[4401.32 → 4401.72] Wow!
[4402.24 → 4403.74] 7,300 viewers.
[4404.10 → 4406.98] I should broadcast without Luke more often.
[4407.46 → 4408.50] Don't tell him I said that.
[4408.80 → 4411.40] He'll be all upset and, you know...
[4413.40 → 4423.02] I really don't understand what this plan was exactly.
[4424.40 → 4425.74] I really thought this would be more dramatic.
[4425.74 → 4437.66] I guess the NCI guys wanted me to disappear in a puff of smoke, or look like I farted a lot and it was cloudy.
[4437.66 → 4439.66] I think they were like...
[4439.66 → 4446.00] Well, the fans are on for one thing, so that's dispersing your smoke machine smoke pretty quickly, I think.
[4448.28 → 4454.66] So now they're firing the smoke machine directly at my butthole, which I guess they're hoping will result in...
[4454.66 → 4458.66] Okay, so our sponsors today were...
[4459.18 → 4461.60] People who I'm going to just roll the outro.
[4461.60 → 4462.60] I don't know.
[4470.60 → 4472.22] You're trying to get that fast.
[4472.22 → 4473.22] Oh yeah, it's fun!
[4473.22 → 4474.22] Dollar Shade Club!
[4474.22 → 4475.22] I fixed it!
[4475.22 → 4476.22] Thank you for watching, guys, and I'll see you next week.
[4476.22 → 4477.22] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4477.22 → 4478.84] Uh, yeah, I have the outro over the thing.
[4478.84 → 4493.84] Jack tried to poke his head into a view, and it didn't work.
[4493.84 → 4495.84] into view and it didn't work.
