[0.00 --> 9.42]  All right. And wibby wabby woo, we are live with only a few technical difficulties this week.
[9.92 --> 16.78]  Yes, my friends, only a few. But we moved the WAN Show logo. It is no longer over top of Luke's
[16.78 --> 24.46]  head. Now it is over top of mine. It's not over your head. Okay. It's, it's, okay. Well, I'm short.
[24.90 --> 29.08]  Are you sitting up taller than usual? No, I'm not. Usually you lower your chair,
[29.08 --> 32.66]  so we're about the same height. I actually never lower my chair. You lower my chair.
[32.76 --> 37.54]  Not that I'm asking you to go ahead and do that now, but you know. That's, that's as low as it can go.
[38.50 --> 45.90]  I'm sorry. God, I hate you. So welcome to the WAN Show, guys. We've got a great show ahead of us
[45.90 --> 52.66]  today, I hope. And we've actually had, honestly, actually, okay, we probably do have a great show
[52.66 --> 57.08]  ahead of us because this has been one of those weeks where I'm averaging about four hours of
[57.08 --> 64.10]  sleep a night. Because I have been working my butt off on a couple of things to just kind of
[64.10 --> 69.94]  kick ass and get us ahead of the eight ball for the first time since we've moved in. Like,
[70.00 --> 75.56]  we actually had some content buffered when we started moving. And then, of course,
[75.56 --> 82.76]  we used it all. Like, we, we, we burned that so hard when we moved. And then since then, I don't
[82.76 --> 89.46]  know if any of you guys have ever moved before, but it's horrible. It's not like you move for three
[89.46 --> 94.78]  days and then you kind of go, oh yeah, I'm going to relax on the front porch with my glass of like
[94.78 --> 101.34]  lemonade and my, you know. I like the lemonade choice. Yeah, the lemonade. And I got like my
[101.34 --> 106.02]  neighbor boy mowing the lawn and it's like, whatever. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's not
[106.02 --> 112.30]  like that. So we have been moving since we moved. We're still, yeah, there's still a lot of stuff
[112.30 --> 116.14]  being sorted out. There's still a lot of stuff, but there's a lot that's taken care of. And it's
[116.14 --> 120.94]  gotten to the point where this week I was able to only do a few moving things. I was able to do all
[120.94 --> 127.66]  the videos that I normally need to do and get two full extra LTTs shot. So stay tuned because
[127.66 --> 133.14]  they're, they're actually both good. Dell sent us a ruggedized tablet that is rated for being
[133.14 --> 138.48]  dropped almost a meter while in operation. Not to mention that it has a capacitive touchscreen
[138.48 --> 142.86]  that operates with water on it. Yeah. So that's cool. Wait, we're supposed to do the intro.
[144.02 --> 148.26]  Chipgate will be a thing that we're being talked, well, that we'll talk about. Also Tesla cars are
[148.26 --> 152.88]  able to auto drive as of yesterday. The Scarp Laser Razor got pulled off Kickstarter and Bell is being
[152.88 --> 156.70]  fined huge amounts of money for faking app reviews on the app store. We should probably do the intro.
[156.70 --> 161.68]  The worst thing about that is that in the context of how much money Bell makes selling you their
[161.68 --> 167.86]  service and their apps, it's really just pennies. But that's a whole other conversation, which I guess
[167.86 --> 171.44]  we should do after the intro.
[171.44 --> 176.06]  I love this show.
[186.70 --> 201.14]  It might be more than one part.
[202.52 --> 205.90]  Heavens. A Linus tech tips video that's multi-part?
[206.32 --> 210.60]  This one, like, I don't think I would have a choice. I think if you put it in one video, even if it was a
[210.60 --> 213.42]  pretty long video, it would be just way too hard to watch. Right.
[213.42 --> 216.84]  Because there's way, there's, you've seen part of the problems that I have to solve already.
[216.84 --> 219.58]  Yes, I have. And I have to, like, document doing all of that.
[220.14 --> 223.04]  Right. And there's more that I probably haven't told you about yet.
[223.06 --> 228.62]  Right. Okay. So basically, Luke has a really cool build blog that he's working on. Actually, it is going to be a
[228.62 --> 235.88]  crazy awesome sort of period of time here for video content. Starting this weekend,
[235.88 --> 241.44]  YouTube is getting the Scrapyard Wars Season 3 premiere. Right. Tomorrow night.
[241.62 --> 248.26]  Yep. Vessel's getting Episode 2. YouTube is getting the dual-headed gaming machine build.
[248.26 --> 251.10]  Oh my god. Did you watch it? That thing is so cool. Yeah.
[252.38 --> 257.46]  So we've got a single box, two gamers playing Battlefront on it at the same time.
[257.46 --> 264.68]  I just finished shooting my video of the X34 Predator LCD. So that's Acer's 34-inch curved
[264.68 --> 271.48]  ultra-wide G-Sync 100 Hz monitor. It's freaking bananas. I just finished filming that Dell ruggedized
[271.48 --> 278.74]  tablet that you can, like, kick around and, like, get this. Not just waterproof. Or water,
[278.86 --> 280.20]  well, nothing is proof. Yeah, yeah.
[280.20 --> 286.92]  Not just water-resistant, like rain, but jets of water from any direction. That's the Ingress
[286.92 --> 290.10]  protection rating on this thing. I am so stoked to put it through the paces.
[290.22 --> 295.76]  That's super cool. To be fair, though, jets of water. Would you count a waterfall as a jet of water?
[296.04 --> 298.42]  I would. Because it has weight to it.
[298.54 --> 304.28]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So my Z3 was held under a waterfall screen up recording with the camera
[304.28 --> 305.88]  for, like, five minutes.
[306.02 --> 306.38]  Why?
[306.96 --> 307.64]  I wanted to test it.
[307.64 --> 308.28]  Because you could?
[308.44 --> 313.32]  Yeah. And it worked fine. So, like, that rating means it can probably take even more than that.
[313.42 --> 317.84]  So I was planning to pull out those, like, Soaker blaster things that we have and just,
[318.04 --> 318.60]  like, wreck it.
[320.30 --> 321.22]  That's awesome, yeah.
[321.30 --> 327.28]  So I'm pretty excited for that. Right. I guess we should do topics? Like, what was I talking
[327.28 --> 329.18]  about before the intro? I'm sorry. I'm super sleep-deprived.
[329.18 --> 331.58]  We should just do, like, the week in recap.
[331.84 --> 337.54]  Right. So we are finally going to be back ahead in terms of the content, which means we're
[337.54 --> 342.22]  not, like, running around. Like, let me find an example. You know, sometimes, sometimes
[342.22 --> 348.98]  people call us out on this. And we don't generally sort of acknowledge it. But come on, guys. It's
[348.98 --> 354.24]  not like we're not aware that once in a while a piece of content is something that we were
[354.24 --> 355.56]  kind of sitting around going,
[356.04 --> 357.96]  What's the fastest thing we can do right now?
[357.96 --> 366.30]  It's 1pm. We don't have a video started yet for tonight. What can we throw together?
[367.52 --> 374.12]  So, like, the server room updates video took forever. It took way longer than it was supposed
[374.12 --> 381.34]  to. So recycling your electronics was one that I've kind of had in my mind for the better
[381.34 --> 386.50]  part of a year. But the original plan was to do it as, like, a music video or something.
[386.62 --> 386.82]  Yeah.
[387.08 --> 387.24]  Yeah.
[387.38 --> 392.34]  So that got kicked in the head. And that became just a normal LTT release.
[392.82 --> 394.08]  Which is super easy.
[394.42 --> 396.32]  Which was easy. But you know what?
[396.32 --> 398.26]  Interesting and important. But easy.
[398.54 --> 404.94]  You know what's really funny? About that video, it really didn't do well on release. But over
[404.94 --> 410.22]  time, it's actually still... So a week after its release, more than a week after its release,
[410.22 --> 415.60]  it's still holding steady at about 4,000 views a day. That is very, very strong. So in the
[415.60 --> 418.10]  long term, that video may actually do really well.
[418.18 --> 418.82]  Which is good.
[418.90 --> 419.86]  Sometimes I think...
[419.86 --> 420.62]  You need less firetruck.
[421.14 --> 422.10]  Yeah, less firetruck.
[423.84 --> 430.88]  Sometimes I think, like, some of our most innovative ideas have come about when we just are kind
[430.88 --> 438.02]  of forced to do something fast. Like, that video, The Best Type of CPU Cooler Final Answer
[438.02 --> 440.06]  that has 1.27 million views.
[440.06 --> 441.40]  Well, you also named it...
[441.40 --> 443.68]  Very clickbaity.
[444.02 --> 446.70]  That's probably one of our, like, most clickbaity videos ever.
[447.12 --> 449.84]  And it's not even... Isn't it not even the final answer?
[450.06 --> 452.74]  Or don't even you... The final answer is...
[452.74 --> 454.42]  It depends. Isn't that what you do?
[454.62 --> 456.46]  Well, that is... That is a thing I do.
[456.50 --> 456.98]  Yes!
[457.18 --> 457.40]  But that is...
[457.40 --> 457.62]  No!
[457.62 --> 458.34]  So it's not a bit...
[458.34 --> 459.42]  That's bullshit!
[459.42 --> 461.42]  No, but that is the answer!
[461.82 --> 463.84]  The final answer is that you don't have an answer.
[464.10 --> 466.06]  It's like... Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[466.14 --> 468.94]  Okay, so Linus Final Answer.
[469.06 --> 473.92]  Here, no, I'm gonna... I'll screen share this with you guys because this is a thing I've done.
[475.08 --> 477.94]  So Best Type of CPU Cooler.
[478.30 --> 479.34]  The final answer.
[479.80 --> 480.48]  It depends.
[481.12 --> 481.40]  Okay?
[482.24 --> 483.66]  Core i7 versus Xeon.
[483.78 --> 484.38]  Which is better?
[484.58 --> 485.32]  Final answer.
[485.58 --> 486.36]  It depends.
[487.08 --> 488.28]  AMD versus Intel.
[488.28 --> 489.28]  Final answer.
[489.28 --> 490.12]  I remember that one.
[490.22 --> 490.94]  It depends.
[491.18 --> 491.40]  Yeah.
[492.16 --> 492.68]  Sometimes...
[492.68 --> 493.86]  AMD versus NVIDIA.
[493.98 --> 494.54]  Final answer.
[495.46 --> 496.30]  Sometimes...
[496.30 --> 497.34]  That's the answer!
[497.84 --> 498.70]  The answer is...
[498.70 --> 499.54]  How old are those videos?
[499.62 --> 500.76]  We should just redo that.
[500.96 --> 502.74]  There's a lot of fanboy hate going around right now.
[502.74 --> 506.14]  Yeah, five years ago was the Intel versus AMD one.
[506.22 --> 509.48]  We could totally redo that because that was on the NCIX Tech Tips channel anyway.
[509.54 --> 510.06]  Not even ours.
[510.20 --> 514.28]  But the thing is that people don't understand about this fanboy crap...
[514.28 --> 514.48]  Yeah.
[514.56 --> 516.82]  ...is that it's not that simple.
[517.10 --> 517.24]  No.
[517.24 --> 520.10]  People are like, don't NVIDIA cards run hot?
[521.18 --> 521.66]  Sometimes.
[522.30 --> 523.04]  Some cards.
[524.08 --> 526.52]  Yeah, 480 was a furnace in your tower.
[526.88 --> 533.20]  I know because I ran four of them in a half X at the time and it was redonkulous.
[533.20 --> 533.60]  Yeah.
[533.90 --> 534.94]  They didn't throttle.
[535.24 --> 535.48]  What?
[535.72 --> 536.24]  Or die.
[536.90 --> 538.24]  But it was in a half X.
[538.48 --> 538.74]  Yeah.
[538.74 --> 539.74]  So, like...
[540.42 --> 541.98]  Yeah.
[542.18 --> 543.78]  We gave them a fighting chance.
[544.02 --> 544.18]  Yeah.
[545.06 --> 545.54]  Sorry.
[545.62 --> 548.08]  I don't remember where I was going with that anymore.
[548.20 --> 548.92]  Right, right, right, right, right.
[549.08 --> 551.84]  The answer is not that simple.
[552.08 --> 553.48]  Life is rarely that simple.
[553.70 --> 554.80]  What car should I buy?
[555.42 --> 556.12]  I don't know.
[556.68 --> 558.58]  Do you need a truck bed?
[558.58 --> 559.14]  No.
[560.02 --> 563.04]  Do you have to make long-haul trips across North America?
[563.54 --> 564.66]  Maybe you need a semi.
[564.80 --> 565.46]  I don't know.
[565.92 --> 567.40]  Are you trying to pick up chicks?
[567.56 --> 568.54]  Maybe lose the semi.
[569.18 --> 572.22]  Unless you're trying to pick up trucker chicks, in which case grab the semi.
[572.22 --> 572.92]  I don't know.
[573.50 --> 574.16]  Who are you?
[574.24 --> 574.80]  What are you about?
[574.80 --> 578.82]  Just a classy woman who wants a man with a straight-up job.
[579.88 --> 580.38]  Right.
[580.50 --> 582.20]  And doesn't want to see him very often.
[583.14 --> 583.42]  Maybe.
[583.86 --> 585.00]  Maybe she's introverted.
[585.38 --> 585.86]  Maybe.
[586.04 --> 586.26]  Okay.
[586.38 --> 591.86]  So introverted chicks who are into a guy with a well-paying job that has him away from home
[591.86 --> 592.20]  a lot.
[594.14 --> 595.86]  Now we're getting really specific.
[596.86 --> 597.62]  All right.
[597.66 --> 599.78]  So let's jump into our first topic of the day.
[599.78 --> 602.02]  This one is from Ars Technica.
[602.32 --> 603.42]  Are you dropping links?
[603.64 --> 603.74]  Sure.
[603.74 --> 605.68]  That was my way of saying, yo, drop the link.
[605.68 --> 606.22]  I know.
[607.80 --> 609.74]  We communicate so well now.
[611.34 --> 613.44]  It's like the old married couple thing.
[613.68 --> 616.34]  It's like, so the glasses.
[616.66 --> 617.50]  Yeah, I'm cleaning them.
[620.94 --> 623.50]  So this is really scary.
[623.50 --> 629.78]  University of Cambridge study finds 87% of Android devices are insecure.
[629.78 --> 638.32]  The study blames the OEMs for lack of updates and ranks Nexus devices as the most secure,
[638.32 --> 641.66]  which shouldn't be a surprise for a couple of reasons.
[641.66 --> 647.08]  Number one, the obvious reason that Google is responsible for updating Nexus devices directly.
[647.08 --> 655.54]  Number two, the less obvious and more unsettling reason is that the Nexus program hasn't been around that long.
[656.04 --> 656.14]  Yeah.
[656.14 --> 660.32]  So Google commits support for Nexus devices for, I believe it's two years.
[660.32 --> 670.64]  So there just aren't that many Nexus devices that are outside of the support period, which isn't saying that the Nexus program solves the problem at all.
[670.64 --> 672.94]  Like, at all.
[674.18 --> 675.16]  This is really brutal.
[675.26 --> 676.62]  Yeah, I mean, this is just brutal stuff.
[676.66 --> 677.10]  What else you got?
[678.26 --> 679.26]  For this topic?
[679.48 --> 679.70]  Yeah.
[679.70 --> 684.22]  Google and OEMs have committed to, like he said, the monthly security update program.
[684.40 --> 684.62]  Some.
[684.62 --> 689.24]  But it's for less than two years old or for Nexus three years old.
[689.26 --> 689.88]  Oh, there you go.
[690.02 --> 692.60]  But that's security updates, not new versions of Android.
[692.72 --> 694.10]  Right, but still security updates.
[694.10 --> 694.26]  Yeah.
[694.44 --> 699.90]  So a lot of people's devices, is it everywhere now that your contract is only allowed to last for two years?
[700.28 --> 701.46]  No, that's Canadian law.
[701.72 --> 702.64]  So not U.S.?
[702.64 --> 704.00]  Yeah, I have no idea how it works elsewhere.
[704.00 --> 704.48]  Okay.
[704.98 --> 709.16]  So in Canada, your contract with your phone company can only last for two years.
[710.08 --> 714.84]  But another thing is, is this agreement two years since the device launched?
[715.04 --> 715.56]  I believe so.
[715.92 --> 718.16]  So not two years since your contract started.
[718.28 --> 724.36]  And a lot of people are going to start a contract and then only want to pay, like, 50 bucks for a phone, not a considerable amount for a phone.
[724.54 --> 730.32]  So they might get an older model of a phone, which is actually very close to its security updates being over.
[730.32 --> 738.84]  So if you're going through rotations of phones based on renewing your contract, which is extremely common, you're, yeah, well, not anymore.
[739.02 --> 745.08]  Yeah, you could end up still on a very current for you phone that's within your contract period.
[745.08 --> 748.66]  So you're not eligible for a device upgrade that is not still getting security updates.
[748.66 --> 756.02]  And this has really come to a head because of some of the really scary Android exploits that have cropped up lately.
[756.94 --> 758.38]  So what's the answer?
[758.38 --> 761.08]  Well, the answer is actually pretty obvious.
[761.40 --> 765.84]  Both Apple and Microsoft with their recent FU to the U.S. carriers.
[766.04 --> 767.14]  Yeah, that was awesome.
[767.24 --> 767.90]  Is that in here?
[767.96 --> 768.80]  Awesome. Yeah, yeah, it's in there.
[768.88 --> 770.64]  We should, maybe we'll move on to, do you want to bring that up?
[770.72 --> 771.78]  We'll do that as our next topic.
[772.48 --> 775.04]  Both Apple and Microsoft have the answer.
[775.54 --> 780.64]  You just have to, well, say FU to the carriers and start and to the OEMs.
[780.64 --> 786.36]  And that, I mean, that might not be something that, that's, it's such a double-edged sword for Google.
[786.36 --> 787.96]  So one, screw the carriers.
[788.14 --> 789.46]  No one cares about what they think.
[789.88 --> 799.84]  And two, you have to be delivering your security updates from a central service the way that both Apple with iOS and Microsoft with Windows 10 are going to be doing.
[799.84 --> 815.76]  The problem is that part of the Android benefit, the double-edged sword that is Android, is that it gives the device makers the flexibility to implement their own upgrades and their own tweaks and their own user experience enhancements.
[815.76 --> 825.22]  Like whether it's multi-window support or whether it's enhanced, I mean, little, even just little stupid things like LG's enhanced copy-paste is awesome.
[825.94 --> 826.92]  Like so awesome.
[827.00 --> 830.72]  It just comes with, it just comes with a clipboard, clipboard tray.
[830.88 --> 832.32]  It's like, yay, this is cool.
[832.44 --> 838.50]  Or, I mean, just little things like the way that Motorola, I love showing this off because it is so cool.
[838.84 --> 844.54]  The way that Motorola lets you just flick a couple times and turn on your flashlight or wiggle and turn on the camera.
[844.54 --> 852.14]  Like my camera launch is faster than any other, anyone else because I can be wiggling it as I lift it up to my face and my camera app is launched.
[852.80 --> 854.76]  But there's things around that too.
[855.24 --> 855.78]  But security.
[856.66 --> 857.00]  Yes.
[857.28 --> 859.16]  And I would rather security personally.
[859.54 --> 869.42]  In the Microsoft article though, it says when asked about carrier updates, Microsoft stated that Microsoft will be working closely with mobile operators to leverage their testing and are,
[869.42 --> 874.58]  this word is a little weird and are fighting to meet and exceed current quality bars.
[874.58 --> 881.64]  We will use their input to decide when to send the updates out based on input from mobile operators mainly and Windows insiders as well.
[882.08 --> 883.96]  But like, so think about it.
[884.00 --> 888.76]  They could talk to those carriers and be like, hey, we're going to launch this in X amount of time.
[888.98 --> 889.68]  Here's all the code.
[889.92 --> 890.60]  Update your crap.
[890.60 --> 894.14]  And if they don't do it, that's their fault in my opinion.
[894.48 --> 896.18]  But instead it's going the other way around.
[896.56 --> 897.74]  They're being too careful about it.
[897.78 --> 898.72]  Being like, here's your stuff.
[899.02 --> 900.36]  You send it out whenever you're ready.
[900.64 --> 902.06]  That's putting no pressure on them.
[902.28 --> 906.32]  And they're just going to be like, eh, we'll update it when our small team has enough time to do something.
[906.32 --> 911.34]  And like, I get the argument from the Android handset maker side where they're like, uh, you know what?
[911.42 --> 918.32]  Actually, our margins are really slim and we straight up can't afford the dev time if you're going to expect us to release a new device X, Y, or Z.
[918.64 --> 919.48]  And you know what?
[919.54 --> 922.50]  The answer to that then is you have to charge more.
[922.50 --> 934.28]  You can't just keep slashing your price in order to stay competitive and just kind of say YOLO, screw it to the customers who already bought your products.
[934.46 --> 940.62]  And the really disappointing part of all of this is, you know, that it's not just the little guys.
[940.70 --> 948.14]  Like, I get it if ZTE or like, you know, what would be an example of like a small, anyway.
[948.14 --> 956.16]  I get it if your little, your little companies, your OnePlus or whatever, if they're kind of going, yeah, we have an enthusiast phone.
[956.30 --> 959.86]  We expect people to update their OS themselves or whatever.
[960.08 --> 961.98]  We're charging a rock bottom price for it.
[962.24 --> 967.68]  I get it if they're kind of taking that stance and that sucks for their users, but hopefully they go into that knowing what they're getting.
[967.94 --> 976.00]  But for the giants like Samsung, it's totally inexcusable to be spending your billions of dollars on marketing the next big thing
[976.00 --> 980.28]  when you're not actually taking care of the last freaking big thing properly.
[981.30 --> 985.76]  So, I mean, yeah, let's see if there's anything else to really mention about the Windows thing.
[985.86 --> 986.36]  Not much.
[986.44 --> 990.96]  Basically, Microsoft is just being relatively aggressive when it comes to updating their stuff.
[991.04 --> 997.72]  And they're saying that their main input on when to update things will be from Windows insiders and mobile operators.
[997.94 --> 1001.64]  But they will just be pushing it directly through their own services anyways.
[1002.20 --> 1005.28]  So if services, if things need to be updated, they just will be.
[1005.28 --> 1007.44]  So there's a lot of things I like about Android.
[1008.06 --> 1016.86]  But this security to me could be a huge, huge factor for Windows mobile adoption.
[1017.42 --> 1017.60]  Yeah.
[1018.44 --> 1020.16]  I mean, it still needs app support.
[1020.34 --> 1021.54]  But, but, but.
[1022.42 --> 1027.26]  Security for a while has been kind of pushing me away from Android a bit, to be completely honest.
[1027.26 --> 1027.48]  Yeah.
[1027.50 --> 1033.50]  Well, I mean, looking at the, the ARS, the ARS graph has a great, has a great graphic here too.
[1033.58 --> 1034.76]  So it's, I mean, this isn't new.
[1035.34 --> 1036.34]  That's the whole point.
[1036.48 --> 1036.64]  Yeah.
[1036.98 --> 1037.22]  Yeah.
[1037.28 --> 1039.34]  It's like going back to April 2012.
[1039.82 --> 1040.06]  Yeah.
[1040.06 --> 1042.62]  It was the same as it is today.
[1042.98 --> 1045.26]  In October 2016.
[1045.96 --> 1046.22]  Yeah.
[1046.76 --> 1047.48]  And there are.
[1047.48 --> 1051.12]  And we've talked about this repeatedly in the past.
[1051.56 --> 1052.92]  Over and over and over again.
[1052.92 --> 1055.26]  About how there's huge security problems.
[1055.62 --> 1058.78]  And like, people are going to slam on me, but I don't care.
[1059.76 --> 1063.16]  When iPhone's coming out with like the little encrypted core and all that kind of stuff.
[1063.26 --> 1068.58]  And when there's the huge case in the States where they were trying to see if, wasn't it government?
[1068.74 --> 1071.08]  Could see what's on that part of your phone.
[1071.08 --> 1073.74]  And they said, no, you can't.
[1074.72 --> 1076.04]  That's awesome.
[1076.62 --> 1077.60]  That's super cool.
[1077.90 --> 1082.60]  It's annoying because there's no way I want to give up this phone.
[1082.88 --> 1083.02]  Yeah.
[1083.16 --> 1084.30]  I love this phone.
[1084.52 --> 1084.74]  Yeah.
[1084.88 --> 1086.08]  Like I actually do.
[1086.46 --> 1086.68]  Yeah.
[1086.70 --> 1090.92]  There's, there's stuff that I hate about the, the iPhone and Windows phone experiences.
[1090.92 --> 1095.86]  The fact that with iOS, you must have an iPhone, which means if you want decent battery life,
[1095.86 --> 1099.90]  you better put some kludgy, stupid Mophie case over top of it.
[1099.90 --> 1106.36]  It's like, thank you, Joni Ive for your beautiful industrial design that just, that isn't fungible.
[1106.36 --> 1107.00]  Camera bump.
[1107.14 --> 1108.84]  Like just so much dumb crap.
[1108.92 --> 1109.04]  Yeah.
[1109.04 --> 1110.40]  There's so many things that make me hate iPhones.
[1110.40 --> 1112.86]  Lose the camera bump and fill it with battery.
[1113.16 --> 1113.90]  What a concept.
[1114.28 --> 1114.52]  Yeah.
[1114.96 --> 1116.18]  But whatever.
[1116.30 --> 1118.26]  It's not artistic enough or something.
[1118.74 --> 1119.88]  And then Windows phone.
[1119.98 --> 1122.98]  I mean, I think my problems with Windows phone are fairly well documented at this point.
[1123.32 --> 1127.24]  Speaking of the iPhone though, let's, let's bring up chip gate.
[1127.24 --> 1130.80]  The iPhone 6s controversy.
[1132.92 --> 1137.30]  So I'm just going to pull up Austin's video on it, which has about 500,000 views.
[1137.44 --> 1137.62]  Yes.
[1137.70 --> 1138.66]  This is something that a lot.
[1138.72 --> 1139.34]  Oh, that's an ad.
[1139.54 --> 1140.88]  Well, we're supporting Austin, right?
[1141.26 --> 1141.44]  Cool.
[1143.10 --> 1143.94]  So I'm going to pull.
[1144.18 --> 1144.32]  Yeah.
[1144.36 --> 1145.90]  I'll pull up Austin's video on it.
[1145.98 --> 1146.20]  Which.
[1146.24 --> 1149.46]  One thing that I really like that I got a call out here is Jonathan Morrison as well.
[1149.74 --> 1149.88]  Yeah.
[1149.88 --> 1152.56]  These guys like kind of teamed up for these videos.
[1152.74 --> 1156.06]  So they both have a call out to each other at the end of each other's videos and their
[1156.06 --> 1157.20]  videos compliment each other.
[1157.28 --> 1160.86]  So if you're interested in chip gate, check out Austin's and Jonathan Morrison's.
[1160.86 --> 1161.28]  Yeah.
[1161.36 --> 1169.48]  So basically in a nutshell, Apple couldn't get enough chips or didn't want to, for whatever
[1169.48 --> 1173.18]  reason, buy all of their chips from a single source.
[1173.18 --> 1179.14]  Because the reality of it is there's only a handful of manufacturers on the planet, Apple
[1179.14 --> 1186.26]  not being one of them, who can actually fabricate semiconductors, like that is micro, microprocessors
[1186.26 --> 1189.46]  at the latest manufacturing process nodes.
[1189.88 --> 1191.12]  So Intel is one of them.
[1191.32 --> 1194.96]  And you can bet that Intel isn't going to run around making iPhone CPUs.
[1194.96 --> 1197.00]  Samsung is another one.
[1197.08 --> 1201.20]  And as unlikely a partnership as that seems, Samsung is actually one of the sources for
[1201.20 --> 1202.20]  the iPhone 6S.
[1202.82 --> 1203.92]  TSMC is another one.
[1204.00 --> 1207.88]  Global Foundries, the spinoff from AMD's old manufacturing, is another.
[1208.52 --> 1210.64]  And I can't remember what happened.
[1210.76 --> 1214.48]  We actually talked about this on WAN Show, but I can't remember what happened to IBM's
[1214.48 --> 1215.76]  junk.
[1216.18 --> 1218.44]  But blah, blah, blah, chip fabrication.
[1218.60 --> 1222.48]  I think they might have sold to Global Foundries, if I recall correctly.
[1222.48 --> 1226.08]  So anyway, there's only a handful of companies you can make them from.
[1226.18 --> 1232.78]  And usually, you go with one or the other, because it requires a significant amount of
[1232.78 --> 1237.78]  re-engineering of the chip itself in order to utilize someone else's manufacturing process.
[1237.82 --> 1243.74]  And in the case of Samsung and TSMC, we are actually talking about them not even quite
[1243.74 --> 1245.52]  being on the same node.
[1245.52 --> 1252.56]  So one of them is, I believe, is 14 nanometer, while the other is 16 nanometer.
[1252.70 --> 1253.88]  But I'm doing that off the top of my head.
[1253.88 --> 1254.08]  Is that correct?
[1254.08 --> 1255.08]  I'm pretty sure it's 14, 16.
[1255.16 --> 1255.90]  I don't see it in the thing.
[1255.90 --> 1256.54]  I'll try to find it.
[1256.56 --> 1263.38]  Which actually means that TSMC's chip is slightly physically larger even.
[1263.38 --> 1264.14]  Like, noticeably.
[1264.14 --> 1267.66]  So Apple had to do a metric crap ton of work.
[1267.76 --> 1275.38]  Now, to be clear, a smaller manufacturing process does not always mean, you know, faster
[1275.38 --> 1276.44]  transistor switching.
[1276.58 --> 1278.18]  So that's the frequency, the megahertz.
[1278.42 --> 1279.62]  It does not always mean that.
[1279.68 --> 1283.98]  It doesn't always mean less or more heat output.
[1284.30 --> 1288.16]  A perfect example of that was, oh, crap, I am drawing a complete blank.
[1288.16 --> 1293.08]  But if I recall correctly, heat output was a bit of an issue on early Ivy Bridge.
[1293.18 --> 1294.30]  But don't quote me on that.
[1294.34 --> 1297.12]  Anyway, the point is that you don't always get this.
[1297.94 --> 1299.74]  Shrinking it was good for a long time.
[1299.96 --> 1304.56]  And then it started to get to the point where shrinking it more caused higher heat density,
[1305.18 --> 1308.78]  which was harder to dissipate because you just don't have a whole lot of area to slap
[1308.78 --> 1309.64]  a heat sink on anymore.
[1309.76 --> 1312.20]  So it's a very, very complicated equation.
[1312.20 --> 1318.04]  And at the end of the day, so for whatever reason, Apple is dual sourcing their A9 processors
[1318.04 --> 1321.12]  from TSMC and from Samsung.
[1321.76 --> 1325.74]  Yes, 14 nanometer from Samsung and 16 nanometer from TSMC.
[1326.16 --> 1329.18]  And it's, this is, the chip gate is already on Wikipedia.
[1329.82 --> 1330.26]  That's awesome.
[1330.64 --> 1337.88]  So basically, YouTuber Austin Evans tested both and saw that TSMC's hardware was capable
[1337.88 --> 1340.58]  of a longer battery life in his test.
[1340.58 --> 1344.82]  So he was using an app called Lirum that identifies which processor a phone has.
[1345.36 --> 1349.86]  And then you pull a reference number and it tells you exactly what code corresponds to it.
[1350.32 --> 1353.88]  The app was, by the way, pulled temporarily due to compatibility issues and it's being put
[1353.88 --> 1354.42]  back up.
[1354.52 --> 1355.50]  That's according to the doc.
[1355.56 --> 1356.96]  I'm not sure if it's back up yet.
[1357.20 --> 1359.98]  I also know that it was free and it showed up again as a paid app.
[1360.08 --> 1361.26]  So there's that as well.
[1362.48 --> 1364.42]  Apple actually did issue a statement.
[1364.42 --> 1369.34]  And one of these days, YouTubers are going to stop, you know, twisting the thumbscrews on poor
[1369.34 --> 1371.70]  Apple with, you know, bend gates and chip gates.
[1371.92 --> 1373.04]  And I wonder what the next gate will be.
[1373.48 --> 1374.56]  So Apple stated that...
[1374.56 --> 1375.00]  Button gate.
[1375.12 --> 1377.10]  ...certain fabric...
[1377.10 --> 1381.82]  ...manufactured lab tests, which run the processors with a continuous heavy workload
[1381.82 --> 1386.52]  until the battery depletes, are not representative of a real-world use case scenario.
[1386.52 --> 1390.72]  Which on Android, they wouldn't be able to say.
[1390.80 --> 1394.34]  Because I've certainly managed that with stupid power hogging apps.
[1394.72 --> 1399.60]  Since they spend an unrealistic amount of time at the highest CPU performance state,
[1399.68 --> 1402.72]  it is a misleading way to measure real-world battery life.
[1402.72 --> 1408.42]  One thing I must say is that manufactured lab tests, if Austin or Jonathan read that and
[1408.42 --> 1410.42]  that is describing their things, good job, guys.
[1410.94 --> 1411.64]  That's impressive.
[1411.94 --> 1412.08]  Yep.
[1412.08 --> 1416.88]  Because Apple saying that what you did was a manufactured lab test is, like, pretty dope,
[1416.98 --> 1417.30]  actually.
[1417.30 --> 1420.68]  But also, they both did a very hardcore style...
[1420.68 --> 1424.88]  If I remember correctly, I think they both did a very hardcore style lab test style test.
[1425.00 --> 1428.60]  And then also did more realistic style scenarios.
[1428.60 --> 1430.48]  And, like, doing this...
[1430.48 --> 1432.32]  To be clear, by manufactured, we're meaning, like, synthetic.
[1432.72 --> 1432.92]  Yes.
[1432.98 --> 1435.08]  Like, not real-world actual usage.
[1435.30 --> 1435.46]  Yeah.
[1435.50 --> 1436.06]  And then...
[1436.06 --> 1439.58]  And then they did things like, oh, I took a time-lapse for a while.
[1439.58 --> 1445.08]  Or I, like, recorded a video for 10 minutes, which is not unrealistic at all.
[1445.18 --> 1445.32]  Yep.
[1445.32 --> 1447.12]  So they both did more real-life stuff.
[1447.34 --> 1451.90]  Updated the video, ran Geekbench, and so at the end of that, the Samsung iPhone was reading
[1451.90 --> 1455.44]  55% battery and the TSMC iPhone was reading 62%.
[1455.44 --> 1456.50]  So...
[1456.50 --> 1458.90]  There were some variances based on what tests that they did.
[1459.08 --> 1461.44]  But like I said earlier, check out both of their videos.
[1461.76 --> 1461.90]  Yeah.
[1462.00 --> 1466.24]  And a thing to understand, too, is that even from chip to chip, from the same manufacturer,
[1466.24 --> 1470.38]  off of the same freaking wafer, you can see significant variations.
[1470.54 --> 1478.22]  I mean, that's why, you know, the Core i7-5960X exists and the 5820K also exists.
[1478.50 --> 1480.40]  They're the same damn thing.
[1480.48 --> 1482.88]  They come off of the same wafer.
[1482.88 --> 1486.16]  But some are better than others, and that's life.
[1486.38 --> 1487.60]  Some of them run at...
[1487.60 --> 1490.56]  I mean, Intel, for example, this happened a couple generations ago now.
[1490.62 --> 1494.76]  They stopped rating their processors at a fixed default voltage.
[1495.18 --> 1495.30]  Yeah.
[1495.30 --> 1496.98]  It's a range now.
[1496.98 --> 1501.98]  So if you buy a CPU for your desktop, it could run at slightly lower or higher power consumption
[1501.98 --> 1503.36]  than the one in your phone.
[1503.44 --> 1504.72]  So that shouldn't really surprise anyone.
[1505.20 --> 1510.76]  But that hasn't kept the usual knee-jerk reaction of, you know, product recall, class action lawsuit
[1510.76 --> 1512.78]  from kind of cropping up.
[1512.78 --> 1520.82]  It's just if Apple only advertises the lower of the two, then it's more of a, yay, I got a bonus
[1520.82 --> 1525.90]  than I got ripped off by buying, you know, luck of the draw, I got the wrong one.
[1526.08 --> 1531.78]  And also, to be fair, it's fairly consistent that the TSMC chip is coming out with much better...
[1532.50 --> 1535.12]  Well, not necessarily even much better, but definitely better.
[1535.34 --> 1535.88]  Noticeably better.
[1536.02 --> 1536.20]  Yeah.
[1536.38 --> 1538.12]  Battery life, it's pretty consistent.
[1538.12 --> 1542.18]  So the binning thing might not completely apply here.
[1542.44 --> 1544.50]  It applies to everything to a certain degree.
[1544.78 --> 1546.92]  But, like, I think it's beyond that by a fair amount.
[1547.14 --> 1551.00]  So, I mean, I guess with all of that said, so we got all the factual stuff out of the way,
[1551.20 --> 1552.74]  what's your take on this?
[1556.22 --> 1557.08]  I don't know.
[1557.62 --> 1560.58]  I already don't like battery life on, like, everything.
[1560.86 --> 1562.60]  This phone is actually a pretty good exception.
[1562.60 --> 1568.46]  I can often get a day and three quarters or maybe even two days if I really drag it out on the second day
[1568.46 --> 1570.06]  and, like, try not to have the screen on too much.
[1571.52 --> 1579.64]  So, anything that's going to screw with my battery life on a phone that honestly doesn't have that great battery life already,
[1579.82 --> 1581.20]  I would probably be pretty pissed off.
[1581.38 --> 1582.40]  So, would you return it?
[1583.08 --> 1585.12]  Bearing in mind that Apple's return policy is excellent.
[1585.46 --> 1587.04]  Would you return it and roll the dice again?
[1587.14 --> 1587.46]  Probably.
[1588.44 --> 1591.40]  I don't, like, setting up a new device does not take that long for me.
[1591.40 --> 1592.46]  Nope, it doesn't anymore.
[1592.54 --> 1592.86]  It used to.
[1592.96 --> 1595.20]  So, if I had a Samsung chip, I would actually return it, yes.
[1596.78 --> 1600.58]  But, would you feel like you're entitled to class action whatever the heck
[1600.58 --> 1602.58]  if you're a bunch of people stuck with Samsung chips now?
[1603.82 --> 1605.14]  Maybe not.
[1605.32 --> 1606.46]  Class action in what form?
[1606.72 --> 1608.22]  Like, do you think Apple owes you money?
[1608.22 --> 1608.60]  Like, so I get, like, 20 bucks?
[1608.62 --> 1610.14]  Yeah, well, that's how they usually work.
[1610.14 --> 1615.28]  If I actually thought that they had advertised it in a different way, yes.
[1615.38 --> 1615.98]  I don't know.
[1616.08 --> 1617.52]  I haven't looked at any of their advertisements.
[1617.52 --> 1620.70]  If I could test it against one of their advertisements and then be like,
[1620.86 --> 1624.38]  no, it didn't make through what you just told me it would, then sure, yes,
[1624.40 --> 1626.90]  I would feel that way because that's false advertising and that's bullshit.
[1627.32 --> 1630.86]  But if it's just not as good as the other one, then no,
[1630.92 --> 1633.02]  I'd just try to roll and gamble and get it eventually.
[1633.28 --> 1633.40]  Right.
[1633.44 --> 1636.50]  Like, I'd just return it, and then if that didn't work, just return it and whatever.
[1636.66 --> 1639.42]  I actually haven't tested my success yet.
[1640.14 --> 1641.00]  You should do it right now.
[1641.32 --> 1643.14]  No, you have to do a bunch of crap.
[1643.58 --> 1644.66]  I thought you just downloaded it and checked.
[1644.66 --> 1646.98]  No, well, okay, it might be now.
[1647.36 --> 1651.38]  When I first looked, you had to download an app and you had to do a bunch of other stupid crap
[1651.38 --> 1653.08]  and register on something or whatever.
[1653.24 --> 1654.30]  Yeah, I was like, ah, screwed.
[1654.40 --> 1655.12]  I don't really care that much.
[1655.24 --> 1655.36]  Okay.
[1656.32 --> 1659.30]  But what I did notice is that compared to my 6,
[1660.26 --> 1664.72]  I was, like, doing better at the end of the day in terms of battery life
[1664.72 --> 1669.60]  when Apple is not making any claims about the 6S having better battery life than the 6.
[1669.60 --> 1669.64]  6.
[1670.30 --> 1672.86]  So maybe I got a bonus.
[1673.24 --> 1674.60]  Maybe I got a TSMC chip.
[1675.24 --> 1675.96]  But I don't know.
[1677.36 --> 1677.74]  Interesting.
[1677.94 --> 1682.90]  So my take on this is that, A, the class action isn't going to work.
[1683.28 --> 1684.90]  It's not like this has never been done before.
[1685.44 --> 1692.24]  NVIDIA with the 960M, I want to say, was using either Maxwell or Kepler,
[1692.90 --> 1696.22]  depending on which notebook model you were buying.
[1696.22 --> 1698.04]  I'm going to double check.
[1698.26 --> 1699.30]  Oh, that's gross.
[1700.88 --> 1702.28]  I'm going to double check that.
[1702.72 --> 1706.34]  Did anything happen with the RAM thing, 3.5 gigs versus 4?
[1706.50 --> 1707.16]  No, I don't think so.
[1707.26 --> 1708.48]  See, something maybe should have happened.
[1708.50 --> 1709.92]  No, maybe it's not the 960.
[1710.18 --> 1711.38]  Maybe it's not the 960M.
[1711.88 --> 1713.38]  Honestly, I think something should have happened.
[1713.40 --> 1715.62]  Was it the 860M or something like that?
[1715.86 --> 1717.94]  860M Kepler versus Maxwell.
[1718.04 --> 1719.94]  Yeah, it looks like it was the 860M.
[1721.10 --> 1722.28]  Where, here we go.
[1722.28 --> 1723.50]  So here's notebook check.
[1724.00 --> 1728.42]  I don't know how comprehensive their benchmarks are or anything like that.
[1728.58 --> 1731.90]  But I think they've got, yeah, they've got 860M Kepler versus Maxwell.
[1732.12 --> 1734.28]  So let's have a look here.
[1734.94 --> 1738.64]  45.2 FPS, 49.6 FPS in Unigine Heaven.
[1739.10 --> 1745.40]  So here, Maxwell is actually significantly faster in certain workloads, slower in others.
[1746.68 --> 1747.36]  Yeah, here we go.
[1747.50 --> 1748.20]  Real world games.
[1748.20 --> 1751.48]  So the Kepler comes out ahead, Maxwell comes out ahead.
[1751.70 --> 1752.90]  They kind of trade blows.
[1754.04 --> 1761.18]  The advantage, I guess, that NVIDIA had in that case was that you couldn't read a review
[1761.18 --> 1767.58]  of that notebook and get a different thing because it was by model of notebook.
[1767.98 --> 1774.14]  So MSI's model XYZ might have Kepler and ASUS's model ABC might have Maxwell.
[1774.14 --> 1774.64]  Yeah.
[1774.64 --> 1780.82]  Whereas with the iPhone 6S, there is, and Apple must understand this, there is more to
[1780.82 --> 1785.86]  it than just the manufacturer's rated spec, be all and end all, as much as they'd love
[1785.86 --> 1786.90]  for that to be the case.
[1787.30 --> 1788.12]  There's reviewers.
[1788.48 --> 1790.62]  There's independent media out there testing these things.
[1790.62 --> 1796.82]  So if it came to light, for example, that I know Apple doesn't seed a ton of devices directly,
[1796.90 --> 1802.02]  but if it came to light that Apple went out of their way to seed a bunch of TSMC phones,
[1802.84 --> 1804.96]  then that could reflect very poorly on them.
[1805.26 --> 1810.08]  And in fact, the only way to really do damage control in that case would be, I think, for
[1810.08 --> 1812.92]  Apple to have seeded out only Samsung phones, for example.
[1812.92 --> 1818.48]  So they could kind of go, okay, whenever we had any direct influence on the review being
[1818.48 --> 1820.58]  done, we showed a worst case scenario.
[1820.82 --> 1827.38]  But if Apple collaborated with reviewers for reviews of the iPhone 6S to be done, and
[1827.38 --> 1831.82]  it is represented in a way that is not indicative of what the consumer will actually receive,
[1832.32 --> 1834.18]  then they could have a real problem on their hands.
[1834.26 --> 1837.20]  But I think it's probably going to take years for all of this to play out.
[1837.70 --> 1839.82]  And by then we'll be bored of talking about it.
[1839.82 --> 1843.64]  And people may or may not get their $20 check in the mail, and that'll basically be that.
[1844.20 --> 1846.28]  People are asking who my favorite hockey team is.
[1846.70 --> 1847.72]  Toronto Maple Leafs.
[1848.04 --> 1848.26]  Really?
[1848.34 --> 1848.80]  Just kidding.
[1848.88 --> 1849.86]  Leafs totally suck.
[1850.10 --> 1851.18]  Oh, thank God.
[1855.48 --> 1859.10]  What is with people asking, like, all these deep questions in Twitch chat?
[1859.22 --> 1861.38]  It's like Twitch chat has forgotten what they are.
[1861.80 --> 1865.06]  Linus, if you never got into computers, what do you think you'd be doing with your life?
[1865.20 --> 1867.50]  I would probably be an elementary school teacher.
[1867.50 --> 1871.14]  Teacher, because I've always liked presenting.
[1871.46 --> 1877.10]  I've always been good at sort of taking things and turning them into something other people
[1877.10 --> 1879.56]  can understand, which is kind of sort of what I do now.
[1880.14 --> 1884.96]  And then elementary school, because I'm just not that smart.
[1885.46 --> 1886.52]  So high school.
[1887.22 --> 1893.26]  Because basically to teach anyone, I feel like you have to have one or two levels higher of
[1893.26 --> 1895.82]  knowledge than you're expecting to give to them.
[1895.82 --> 1902.28]  So I'm not smart enough to teach, like, university or high school, but I definitely have a firm
[1902.28 --> 1905.34]  enough understanding of the next two levels up to teach elementary school.
[1905.44 --> 1906.60]  So that's probably what I would have gone with.
[1909.32 --> 1911.20]  Oh, I've got a whole lot of screw you, Linus.
[1911.56 --> 1912.94]  What do you mean screw you, Linus?
[1912.94 --> 1917.12]  Even Mike Babcock cannot make the Leafs good.
[1917.52 --> 1917.98]  I'm sorry.
[1920.40 --> 1921.80]  Even all the...
[1921.80 --> 1922.80]  What was his...
[1922.80 --> 1923.40]  Here, hold on.
[1923.80 --> 1925.92]  What was the Mike Babcock contract?
[1926.88 --> 1928.22]  Because that was, like, horrendous.
[1928.26 --> 1930.92]  Wasn't it, like, $70 million or something ridiculous like that?
[1931.34 --> 1933.40]  A $50 million contract.
[1933.62 --> 1936.26]  It's like, no matter how much money you spend...
[1936.26 --> 1941.96]  Honestly, I think the coach's salary, in cases like this, where you're doing, like, blockbuster
[1941.96 --> 1945.08]  coaching deals, I think it should cost against your cap hit.
[1945.14 --> 1949.68]  Because if the whole idea behind the salary cap is that you want to increase parity in
[1949.68 --> 1953.72]  the league, you don't want people running around spending 50...
[1953.72 --> 1954.42]  So what is it?
[1954.44 --> 1957.98]  Eight-year deal at $6.25 million on the coach.
[1958.36 --> 1959.96]  And, like, all this crap.
[1961.08 --> 1965.30]  You know, like, these other staff to, like, make the players better.
[1966.14 --> 1970.50]  But, I mean, with that said, whether a salary cap has a place in professional sports is a
[1970.50 --> 1972.06]  whole other argument that I'm not getting into.
[1972.46 --> 1976.18]  I'm just saying that if you're going to have a salary cap, and if you're going to, you
[1976.18 --> 1980.90]  know, play that song that's all about equality and every team having an equal chance at
[1980.90 --> 1983.90]  the Stanley Cup, then it should also apply to the rest of the staff on the ice.
[1984.12 --> 1989.58]  Do you want to segue from that to more things about equality and equal chance and slamming
[1989.58 --> 1990.60]  on NVIDIA a little bit more?
[1990.86 --> 1991.52]  Oh, sure, yeah.
[1991.52 --> 1994.06]  To something that I don't think is in the dock, but should have been.
[1994.06 --> 1994.78]  It's not?
[1994.94 --> 1996.28]  I put it on the list.
[1996.36 --> 1996.72]  Is it?
[1997.56 --> 1999.16]  How is this not in the dock?
[1999.42 --> 2000.72]  I thought I put it on the list.
[2002.48 --> 2003.50]  What the crap?
[2003.66 --> 2004.94]  Okay, well, this is...
[2004.94 --> 2009.26]  This super, super pissed me off for a number of reasons.
[2009.26 --> 2014.26]  NVIDIA, GeForce Experience, GameDay Driver.
[2014.38 --> 2016.88]  Sorry, I'll find some article and I'll bring it up for you guys.
[2017.28 --> 2018.76]  Oh, look, it's Ars Technica again.
[2018.92 --> 2019.96]  These guys are awesome.
[2020.06 --> 2020.86]  I love Ars Technica.
[2021.00 --> 2023.30]  They're actually like my favorite tech news site.
[2025.10 --> 2028.10]  Other than linustechtips.com, where you can also discuss with members of the Linus Tech
[2028.10 --> 2030.66]  Tips community, the Ars Technica articles that we link to.
[2031.26 --> 2035.38]  So the latest NVIDIA drivers to be locked behind GeForce Experience.
[2035.38 --> 2041.38]  So it's pretty unusual for NVIDIA to do a whole press briefing, conference call thing about...
[2042.72 --> 2043.50]  Anything that isn't hardware.
[2043.76 --> 2045.26]  Yeah, anything that isn't hardware.
[2045.64 --> 2047.66]  The software stuff is always just attached to some launch.
[2047.88 --> 2048.22]  Yes.
[2048.40 --> 2052.58]  And they're really good at doing that because it gives us something to talk about when we're like,
[2053.24 --> 2055.18]  it's the GTX 950.
[2055.50 --> 2056.86]  You increased all the spec numbers.
[2056.86 --> 2064.14]  But not as high as the 960 and 970 that we already have if we're willing to shell out some more money.
[2064.80 --> 2069.66]  So it gives the press something to like an actual story to tell, which is great.
[2070.72 --> 2071.90]  But they did one.
[2072.50 --> 2076.86]  And I talked to Luke and John who attended this call and the report was something along the lines of...
[2077.42 --> 2080.24]  To be fair, I figured out there was no hardware coming out and I bailed early.
[2080.60 --> 2080.96]  Oh, right.
[2081.10 --> 2081.30]  Okay.
[2081.30 --> 2085.86]  And then John's report was something along the lines of this is the most boring briefing ever.
[2086.46 --> 2089.20]  And he used to work in law.
[2090.80 --> 2093.44]  So like, rip NVIDIA.
[2093.44 --> 2093.56]  Yeah.
[2095.88 --> 2101.86]  So basically, what's happening is game ready drivers will no longer be downloadable through the NVIDIA website.
[2102.92 --> 2104.54]  Which is crazy.
[2105.26 --> 2111.02]  And only like standard drivers will be available through the NVIDIA website, which I think come out once a quarter or something.
[2111.08 --> 2112.54]  Yeah, once a quarter or something like that.
[2112.76 --> 2115.86]  And then to be able to get game ready drivers, you have to have GeForce Experience.
[2116.58 --> 2118.22]  And sign up with your email address.
[2118.22 --> 2118.66]  Yes.
[2118.66 --> 2118.94]  Yes.
[2119.08 --> 2123.66]  Email address verification required to be able to download anything.
[2123.80 --> 2126.96]  Now, to be clear, it's not like you can't use a throwaway email address.
[2127.58 --> 2131.92]  It's not like you can't filter the crap out of your email so they just go into a dump folder immediately.
[2132.04 --> 2132.22]  Yes.
[2132.94 --> 2134.52]  But why?
[2134.52 --> 2135.56]  It's just dirty.
[2135.56 --> 2139.56]  Putting any impediment in the way...
[2140.10 --> 2140.98]  Of a driver.
[2141.08 --> 2143.32]  Of a driver is horrible.
[2144.00 --> 2147.16]  I mean, I don't think I've ever ripped on AdaptTech for this before.
[2147.16 --> 2153.08]  AdaptTech turns off their download driver servers outside of business hours.
[2153.34 --> 2153.76]  Yeah.
[2155.92 --> 2161.08]  So I was in the middle of the night reformatting a server, trying to...
[2161.08 --> 2162.54]  I got my new OS on it.
[2162.60 --> 2164.48]  I'm trying to get my array back online.
[2164.82 --> 2168.24]  And I cannot install drivers for my RAID card.
[2168.80 --> 2169.66]  Are you for real?
[2169.66 --> 2179.04]  So, I mean, any reason for, you know, downloadrepository.com, which probably exists and maybe it's legit, but it probably isn't.
[2179.26 --> 2183.44]  Any reason for those sites to never have to exist ever again...
[2183.44 --> 2184.06]  Is a good one.
[2184.08 --> 2184.68]  ...is good.
[2185.02 --> 2185.34]  Yes.
[2185.34 --> 2188.12]  Hiding your drivers behind...
[2188.12 --> 2191.66]  And even just stupid stuff, like wasting my time.
[2192.08 --> 2200.90]  Why do I have to download off your site and then click update in GeForce Experience and wait for another download and another install?
[2201.12 --> 2202.22]  It's stupid.
[2202.68 --> 2204.56]  I even like GeForce Experience.
[2205.42 --> 2206.54]  But I don't care.
[2206.72 --> 2207.72]  This is dumb.
[2207.72 --> 2212.18]  And in NVIDIA, I mean, there are a lot of things that you can say in NVIDIA's defense.
[2212.42 --> 2217.40]  In their defense, after you install drivers for the first time, a reboot is no longer required.
[2218.16 --> 2221.16]  So once you install within GeForce Experience, at least you don't...
[2221.16 --> 2222.16]  Does it have anything to do with your email?
[2222.24 --> 2223.24]  At least you don't have to restart.
[2223.34 --> 2225.16]  No, that's just crappy across the board.
[2225.40 --> 2225.54]  Yeah.
[2225.92 --> 2227.24]  Like GeForce Experience is cool.
[2227.36 --> 2228.02]  I actually really like it.
[2228.02 --> 2231.00]  I was complaining about them wasting my time because I can give them a throwaway email.
[2231.20 --> 2231.64]  I don't care.
[2232.30 --> 2235.26]  But wasting my time, I don't like.
[2235.26 --> 2240.38]  Like, and then sort of another sort of kind of, okay, yeah, I guess I kind of get it.
[2240.38 --> 2241.78]  Imagine this is your first time, too.
[2242.42 --> 2243.86]  You just got a new graphics card.
[2244.00 --> 2244.20]  Yep.
[2244.36 --> 2246.56]  You didn't have an NVIDIA graphics card before.
[2246.72 --> 2247.80]  You just want to play some games.
[2248.20 --> 2249.66]  You show up at your buddy's house.
[2249.74 --> 2252.48]  You're going to install the card and then have a little LAN between the two of you.
[2252.74 --> 2253.42]  You install your card.
[2253.52 --> 2256.96]  He's already kind of playing and you're just like, come on, okay.
[2257.40 --> 2258.44]  I downloaded GeForce Experience.
[2258.44 --> 2259.86]  Okay, now I have to type in my email.
[2260.24 --> 2261.42]  Now I have to verify this.
[2261.48 --> 2264.74]  So you have to go to your email, click on the thing, verify the thing.
[2264.74 --> 2266.32]  Okay, now I can actually download the driver.
[2266.44 --> 2267.76]  Okay, now I probably have to restart.
[2267.96 --> 2268.72]  It's just obnoxious.
[2268.78 --> 2269.92]  Like, there's so many more steps.
[2270.02 --> 2281.00]  So again, in NVIDIA's defense, their older non-game ready drivers from our recent driver improvements through the ages showdown are pretty good.
[2281.00 --> 2292.42]  In NVIDIA's defense, again, their quarterly, WICL, complete package drivers absolutely crush how often AMD is doing it right now.
[2292.42 --> 2294.42]  But that leads us...
[2294.42 --> 2295.30]  But none of this has to do with the email.
[2295.74 --> 2296.56]  No, I know.
[2296.64 --> 2297.44]  I completely agree.
[2297.50 --> 2299.92]  The email is rubbish and that's stupid and this shouldn't exist.
[2300.40 --> 2304.48]  But all those other things basically lead me to my final point.
[2304.94 --> 2307.96]  If AMD was competitive, this wouldn't be happening.
[2307.96 --> 2322.68]  This is the kind of crap that doesn't happen if NVIDIA has to kind of look at their, you know, also has 40% of the market and a very competitive product and this could push consumers over the edge.
[2322.68 --> 2330.84]  If NVIDIA doesn't have to worry about AMD breathing down their neck, a lot of people kind of go, you know, NVIDIA needs AMD to keep their prices fair.
[2330.92 --> 2331.22]  You know what?
[2331.24 --> 2337.82]  I think NVIDIA has kind of locked into what they figure people are willing to pay for a graphics card and they're already charging as much as they feel like.
[2338.06 --> 2338.80]  Let's be honest.
[2339.24 --> 2341.66]  This is the kind of stuff that worries me more.
[2342.00 --> 2345.08]  Where they feel like they've got free reign to...
[2345.08 --> 2347.56]  Because like, straight up, this is for marketing emails.
[2347.56 --> 2354.60]  Yes, they've got free reign to ask for your personal information and to waste your time because what else are you going to buy?
[2356.90 --> 2360.30]  So that's basically the long and short of that one.
[2360.44 --> 2361.38]  I don't like it.
[2361.46 --> 2362.66]  You shouldn't like it.
[2366.90 --> 2371.04]  But I'm not really sure what I'm going to do because I want game ready drivers.
[2371.32 --> 2373.16]  So I guess I'll be downloading them through GeForce Experience.
[2373.16 --> 2377.98]  And like, for people that already have GeForce cards, like...
[2377.98 --> 2378.52]  Yeah.
[2379.02 --> 2379.44]  Oh, yeah.
[2379.56 --> 2383.42]  You can't really vote with your wallet at that point unless you have enough money to buy a new card already.
[2383.70 --> 2387.86]  And people that have like a 900 series card, probably not a thing.
[2388.42 --> 2389.78]  They probably just bought it.
[2390.38 --> 2391.40]  Oh, I don't know.
[2392.54 --> 2393.04]  All right.
[2393.14 --> 2393.66]  Pretty rough.
[2393.84 --> 2394.46]  Don't like it.
[2394.98 --> 2395.56]  Very annoying.
[2396.20 --> 2398.02]  So let's move on to our next topic.
[2398.02 --> 2399.28]  And that's the same thing like what you just said.
[2399.44 --> 2401.04]  It's not technically the worst thing in the world.
[2401.16 --> 2402.08]  I can just filter it out.
[2402.08 --> 2402.80]  But it's scary.
[2403.28 --> 2403.52]  Yep.
[2403.64 --> 2404.26]  It's just crappy.
[2404.52 --> 2404.80]  Anyways.
[2405.00 --> 2407.22]  Tesla cars can drive themselves starting October 15th.
[2407.50 --> 2408.02]  They...
[2408.02 --> 2409.86]  That's a little bit sensationalist.
[2409.88 --> 2410.12]  Yeah.
[2410.24 --> 2412.08]  That is like a super...
[2412.08 --> 2414.18]  Like a mega redonkulously sensationalist.
[2414.18 --> 2415.60]  Like the Verge used to be cool.
[2416.08 --> 2417.22]  You guys used to be cool.
[2417.72 --> 2421.94]  And like now you're really not being that cool right now.
[2425.34 --> 2427.42]  Tesla's cars can drive themselves starting tomorrow.
[2427.50 --> 2428.66]  In a straight line.
[2428.88 --> 2429.94]  They can...
[2429.94 --> 2430.58]  Sort of.
[2430.58 --> 2432.18]  Well, a little bit more than that.
[2432.22 --> 2433.26]  They can switch lanes and stuff.
[2434.46 --> 2437.00]  If you turn your turn signal on, then it's like, oh, okay.
[2438.18 --> 2440.18]  So basically, they can...
[2440.18 --> 2442.54]  It's like super badass cruise control.
[2442.74 --> 2443.90]  Someone described it that way.
[2444.02 --> 2445.30]  That's not me saying that.
[2445.36 --> 2446.08]  I'm copying them.
[2446.12 --> 2446.90]  I don't remember who it was.
[2447.02 --> 2450.02]  But it's basically like the sickest cruise control.
[2450.22 --> 2450.36]  Yeah.
[2450.56 --> 2453.10]  They're officially saying right now you're supposed to keep your hands on the wheel.
[2453.28 --> 2453.46]  Yeah.
[2453.64 --> 2454.22]  Please do that.
[2454.22 --> 2455.14]  You're not supposed to let go of the wheel.
[2455.26 --> 2455.44]  Yeah.
[2455.44 --> 2457.22]  And I would highly recommend that.
[2458.54 --> 2459.66]  It's auto steer.
[2459.82 --> 2460.84]  It's going to keep you in the lanes.
[2460.94 --> 2462.12]  It'll check for side collisions.
[2462.24 --> 2464.06]  It can turn for you if you turn the turn signal on.
[2464.54 --> 2464.86]  Wait.
[2464.92 --> 2465.82]  I don't think it turns for you.
[2465.86 --> 2467.20]  I think it changes lanes for you only.
[2467.36 --> 2467.76]  Oh, sorry.
[2467.84 --> 2468.02]  Yeah.
[2468.12 --> 2470.38]  It'll change lanes for you if you turn your turn signal on.
[2470.38 --> 2471.02]  Auto park.
[2471.16 --> 2472.46]  So it'll scan for parking spots.
[2472.60 --> 2472.82]  Yep.
[2473.04 --> 2474.24]  They're saying this is...
[2474.24 --> 2475.46]  That's a beta feature, by the way.
[2475.46 --> 2479.14]  I love how there's beta features for a car.
[2479.24 --> 2479.90]  It's so dangerous.
[2481.24 --> 2483.48]  I believe this is version 7.0.
[2483.72 --> 2484.24]  Something like that.
[2484.30 --> 2484.42]  Yep.
[2484.54 --> 2484.72]  Yeah.
[2484.72 --> 2485.22]  7.0.
[2485.28 --> 2490.78]  So 7.1 will make it so that it can drive out to a garage and then come pick you up.
[2492.18 --> 2493.74]  But yeah.
[2493.80 --> 2494.70]  Is that even in here?
[2496.28 --> 2496.64]  Yep.
[2496.66 --> 2497.22]  That's in here.
[2497.90 --> 2498.60]  That's what it does.
[2499.28 --> 2499.50]  Yes.
[2499.50 --> 2499.74]  Okay.
[2499.82 --> 2503.42]  So 7.1 will be able to drive off to a garage and come pick you up when needed, which is
[2503.42 --> 2504.12]  super sick.
[2504.12 --> 2506.28]  But yeah.
[2506.34 --> 2510.62]  They're being very clear that if problems happen, it's still totally your fault.
[2511.68 --> 2514.98]  So basically, it's kind of coming along.
[2515.52 --> 2521.28]  They're going to be continuously uploading real-world sensor data from the 7.0 equipped vehicles
[2521.28 --> 2522.52]  to continue to improve it.
[2522.80 --> 2525.60]  So there's four sensor types on the car that they're going to be utilizing here.
[2525.66 --> 2531.56]  Forward radar, forward-facing camera, 360-degree ultrasonic sensors, and a GPS combined with
[2531.56 --> 2533.12]  their high-resolution navigation maps.
[2533.12 --> 2535.52]  So they're probably going to be learning patterns.
[2535.72 --> 2535.94]  Yes.
[2536.06 --> 2539.98]  Well, if this car starts driving this way, maybe I should stay away from it or whatever.
[2540.12 --> 2540.86]  It'll start learning.
[2540.96 --> 2546.82]  And the whole fleet will kind of hive mind to each other and allow themselves to learn
[2546.82 --> 2548.40]  to drive better.
[2548.40 --> 2557.68]  And so Tesla figures that the functionality will improve with each passing week, even without
[2557.68 --> 2563.28]  firmware updates, since the car is always accessing and improving Tesla's high-res maps.
[2563.44 --> 2564.00]  Very cool.
[2564.38 --> 2564.58]  Yeah.
[2564.74 --> 2565.14]  That's awesome.
[2565.76 --> 2566.34]  That's interesting.
[2566.78 --> 2572.52]  I watched a video, and it's a little creepy, because the guy goes over a fairly substantial
[2572.52 --> 2572.88]  bump.
[2572.88 --> 2576.68]  I don't know if it's like a pothole or what it is, because the camera's on the inside
[2576.68 --> 2577.06]  of the car.
[2577.16 --> 2578.20]  So I can't see what's on the road.
[2578.44 --> 2578.52]  Right.
[2578.64 --> 2583.02]  But the car jumps a little bit, and you can tell it went over something.
[2583.14 --> 2584.10]  It wasn't the car just jumping.
[2584.48 --> 2585.36]  And the car is...
[2585.36 --> 2587.30]  The wheel is like, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[2587.40 --> 2587.58]  Okay.
[2588.16 --> 2592.22]  And the car doesn't jostle around, but it does just amount the correction that it probably
[2592.22 --> 2592.72]  needed to.
[2593.06 --> 2593.80]  And it picks everything.
[2593.80 --> 2597.52]  And the guy in the car is like, okay, it's fine.
[2598.60 --> 2600.10]  It's just crazy to watch.
[2600.22 --> 2600.56]  I don't know.
[2600.62 --> 2601.10]  It was pretty cool.
[2601.14 --> 2603.46]  I think it was Jalopnik that I watched the video on.
[2603.56 --> 2603.86]  Excellent.
[2603.96 --> 2604.98]  You can check that out if you want.
[2605.76 --> 2606.26]  All right.
[2606.30 --> 2606.96]  We've got...
[2606.96 --> 2610.22]  I think we're going to kind of bundle four news topics into one here.
[2610.50 --> 2613.38]  So AMD reports their third quarter results.
[2613.54 --> 2616.06]  So the original article here was from MarketWatch.
[2616.86 --> 2618.86]  Basically, they're not good.
[2618.86 --> 2625.04]  But if you look at it quarter over quarter instead of year over year, then I guess the
[2625.04 --> 2630.92]  revenue growth is nice, but they're still losing like millions and millions of dollars.
[2631.56 --> 2635.56]  They're back over a billion dollars revenue, which is cool, I guess.
[2635.68 --> 2636.12]  That's cool.
[2636.50 --> 2642.96]  But like I could sell $10 bills for $8, and I could probably do a billion dollars of revenue,
[2643.14 --> 2644.54]  which is basically what AMD is doing.
[2644.54 --> 2652.26]  Also, AMD is spinning off their back-end testing and assembly operations into a joint venture
[2652.26 --> 2653.90]  for $371 million.
[2654.30 --> 2657.54]  So, you know, back to the whole...
[2659.26 --> 2659.94]  Oh, crap.
[2659.96 --> 2660.50]  Real men have fabs.
[2660.50 --> 2662.22]  I think it was Jerry Sanders III.
[2662.42 --> 2663.74]  Real men have fabs.
[2664.26 --> 2670.38]  AMD now not only doesn't have fabs, they don't have the assembly plant for taking the silicon
[2670.38 --> 2671.94]  and turning it into chips.
[2671.94 --> 2677.40]  They are going full fabless, but the good news is that this gets rid of, I think it was
[2677.40 --> 2680.66]  something like 1,700 employees that are no longer on payroll.
[2680.92 --> 2681.04]  Yep.
[2681.80 --> 2686.14]  So the joint venture will see AMD contribute their facilities in Penang.
[2686.14 --> 2686.94]  They're not being fired.
[2687.22 --> 2687.42]  Yeah.
[2687.94 --> 2688.16]  Yeah.
[2688.26 --> 2688.40]  Yeah.
[2688.46 --> 2689.90]  Joint venture with...
[2689.90 --> 2690.36]  Oh, crap.
[2690.44 --> 2690.90]  Now I forget.
[2691.78 --> 2692.18]  Fujitsu?
[2692.36 --> 2692.50]  Yeah.
[2692.64 --> 2693.04]  That's right.
[2693.24 --> 2693.40]  Yeah.
[2693.76 --> 2695.18]  So there you go.
[2695.30 --> 2695.82]  So there's that.
[2695.82 --> 2700.48]  So more bad news for AMD and actually some bad news for Intel.
[2700.48 --> 2706.62]  They report flat revenues and lower year-over-year profits for Q3.
[2706.74 --> 2709.36]  Original article here is from Tech Report.
[2709.94 --> 2715.28]  And the reason that that's bad news is because if business isn't growing, that's really, really,
[2715.28 --> 2716.44]  really, really terrible.
[2716.94 --> 2725.02]  Because as much as they're still making 65% gross margin on their $14.6 billion of revenue,
[2725.66 --> 2729.00]  which I think was something along the lines of...
[2729.72 --> 2730.58]  Oh, crap.
[2730.88 --> 2732.18]  I forget what net profit it was.
[2732.24 --> 2732.80]  It was in the notes.
[2732.86 --> 2733.22]  Do you have it?
[2733.22 --> 2735.62]  I do not see it.
[2736.12 --> 2737.58]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2737.58 --> 2739.22]  Are you sure net profit is in the notes?
[2739.22 --> 2740.40]  No, I'm not sure.
[2740.64 --> 2743.36]  Net profits were still very, very, very good.
[2744.86 --> 2745.30]  But...
[2745.30 --> 2746.52]  Growth is very important.
[2746.64 --> 2747.36]  Growth is important.
[2747.46 --> 2748.30]  It means you're innovating.
[2748.42 --> 2750.34]  It means your customers are inspired.
[2750.46 --> 2751.42]  They're coming back for more.
[2751.52 --> 2753.22]  I was just going to say inspired and coming back for more.
[2753.28 --> 2754.32]  I'm not that surprised.
[2754.90 --> 2758.66]  Yeah, I'm not surprised either, which ties into the last...
[2758.66 --> 2759.28]  The last...
[2759.28 --> 2759.42]  Oh.
[2760.00 --> 2765.64]  Apparently, this link to CTV News is dead, unfortunately.
[2765.64 --> 2766.66]  So there's...
[2766.66 --> 2775.08]  Basically, the synopsis is Intel HP PC Does What Campaign.
[2775.18 --> 2775.66]  There we go.
[2776.32 --> 2777.68]  Ars Technica's site is working.
[2778.90 --> 2779.54]  Yay, Ars.
[2779.68 --> 2780.02]  Cringe.
[2780.02 --> 2784.82]  Cringe-worthy PC Does What Campaign wants you to upgrade.
[2785.92 --> 2790.26]  So because Intel has been building more power-efficient desktop chips
[2790.26 --> 2793.24]  and hasn't necessarily been that focused on, you know,
[2793.28 --> 2794.66]  dramatically improving performance,
[2794.66 --> 2798.68]  and, I mean, there's another issue is that there's not a whole lot of things
[2798.68 --> 2801.64]  that you would want to do on a PC today
[2801.64 --> 2804.24]  that you couldn't do on a PC from three to four years ago.
[2804.82 --> 2806.64]  So help make more things.
[2806.78 --> 2807.90]  So help make more things.
[2808.52 --> 2810.78]  And, I mean, it's not like they're not trying.
[2811.06 --> 2813.50]  I mean, there's those cameras with the depth sensor
[2813.50 --> 2817.18]  that I can't imagine what anyone but a game streamer would use for anything.
[2817.34 --> 2820.06]  Like, there's other stuff you can do, though.
[2820.32 --> 2820.68]  I don't know.
[2820.74 --> 2823.32]  I think the VR space is going to be huge for people upgrading PCs.
[2823.32 --> 2824.58]  Yes, that will.
[2824.96 --> 2827.52]  But in the meantime, we have PC Does What Campaign.
[2828.10 --> 2832.40]  And it's Dell, HP, Intel, Lenovo, and Microsoft contributing to this
[2832.40 --> 2837.04]  with no specific, like, product that they're trying to sell.
[2837.24 --> 2841.64]  And the idea is just to educate, apparently, very mainstream users.
[2841.64 --> 2846.26]  This is a mainstream user, I think, according to this campaign,
[2846.38 --> 2849.92]  to educate mainstream users about what a PC does
[2849.92 --> 2851.58]  and why you might give a crap about it.
[2852.24 --> 2853.28]  So there's a PC.
[2854.78 --> 2856.46]  That's something someone would do.
[2856.56 --> 2857.40]  That's the...
[2857.40 --> 2858.00]  Wow, that's...
[2858.00 --> 2859.34]  I hadn't actually watched it yet.
[2862.16 --> 2866.76]  Yeah, most helicopter pilots probably have a laptop in their lap.
[2866.76 --> 2871.40]  Wow, this is actually far worse than I thought.
[2877.34 --> 2877.82]  Wow.
[2878.94 --> 2880.62]  I know it's sponsored by Lenovo.
[2880.62 --> 2883.40]  In basically every single one of those situations,
[2883.68 --> 2886.20]  that laptop that you're testing out would have been better.
[2887.80 --> 2888.96]  Because it's more rugged.
[2890.08 --> 2890.52]  Wow.
[2890.98 --> 2892.02]  That's pretty brutal.
[2892.02 --> 2898.18]  Sorry, I don't know...
[2898.18 --> 2899.70]  Why didn't they come to us for this?
[2901.44 --> 2903.18]  We could have done so much better.
[2903.40 --> 2903.66]  Yeah.
[2904.02 --> 2905.94]  The problem is we would have come up with, like,
[2906.06 --> 2909.02]  awesome stuff that a PC does that has zero interest to...
[2909.02 --> 2911.72]  That didn't have a helicopter or some dude in a dinghy in the ocean.
[2911.84 --> 2912.84]  That has, like...
[2912.84 --> 2916.64]  But the problem is we'd come up with stuff that she's not interested in.
[2917.24 --> 2919.86]  Mind you, I don't think she's interested in flying a helicopter
[2919.86 --> 2921.38]  with a computer in her lap either.
[2921.38 --> 2923.06]  No one should be interested in that.
[2923.06 --> 2923.74]  And, like, the music...
[2923.74 --> 2924.94]  They play the music in the cockpit.
[2925.26 --> 2927.52]  No one would use a full laptop for that.
[2927.84 --> 2928.78]  Not to mention...
[2928.78 --> 2929.12]  They use a phone.
[2929.26 --> 2931.68]  Not to mention that I've never encountered a laptop
[2931.68 --> 2934.46]  that you'd be able to hear over the sound of helicopter routers.
[2934.68 --> 2934.76]  No.
[2935.54 --> 2935.90]  No.
[2936.04 --> 2936.88]  You'd have a phone,
[2936.98 --> 2939.24]  and then that would talk to the helicopter,
[2939.42 --> 2941.46]  which would then broadcast that to your headset.
[2941.60 --> 2943.20]  That's assuming that we have helicopters
[2943.20 --> 2946.02]  with, like, Bluetooth dashboard stereos.
[2946.08 --> 2946.92]  Oh, you do.
[2947.08 --> 2947.46]  Do they?
[2947.64 --> 2948.62]  There's badass.
[2948.76 --> 2949.34]  Okay, okay.
[2949.42 --> 2949.86]  Like, luxury.
[2949.86 --> 2951.02]  That wasn't a luxury helicopter.
[2951.02 --> 2952.28]  That was like the Coast Guard.
[2952.44 --> 2952.76]  No, it was a rescue helicopter.
[2952.76 --> 2953.10]  Yeah.
[2953.58 --> 2954.54]  I mean, we're talking...
[2954.54 --> 2956.00]  Hey, man, pass the aux cable.
[2956.06 --> 2956.64]  We're talking...
[2956.64 --> 2957.62]  I gotta play this fire.
[2957.72 --> 2960.60]  We're talking as lucky if that thing flies in Canada.
[2960.94 --> 2961.62]  In Canada, yeah.
[2962.88 --> 2964.36]  We use boats for usually.
[2966.02 --> 2967.54]  Did you just say for usually?
[2967.86 --> 2968.00]  No.
[2968.02 --> 2970.12]  Because that actually would have been awesome in that case.
[2970.18 --> 2971.44]  We use boats for usually.
[2973.30 --> 2974.36]  We're in Canada.
[2974.36 --> 2977.04]  I think I said usually.
[2977.36 --> 2979.28]  Oh, this is bad.
[2980.32 --> 2980.72]  Oh, whoops.
[2980.78 --> 2981.24]  Oh, derp.
[2981.42 --> 2982.96]  Yeah, this is some ugly stuff.
[2983.04 --> 2984.18]  So this is over on Engadget.
[2984.82 --> 2987.80]  Bell, as much as sometimes they're our friends,
[2987.90 --> 2988.92]  because my reception,
[2989.24 --> 2991.40]  except here at the office where we had to get a cell booster,
[2991.78 --> 2994.86]  is good, and they've done...
[2994.86 --> 2996.38]  You know, it's not that amazing, though.
[2996.96 --> 2997.46]  Yeah, it's okay.
[2997.68 --> 2998.36]  Switching from...
[2998.36 --> 2999.34]  I came from TELUS,
[2999.40 --> 3002.22]  and I've very vocally said many things about TELUS.
[3002.38 --> 3002.52]  Yeah.
[3002.60 --> 3003.70]  It's not like I love them,
[3003.82 --> 3006.26]  but my reception is slightly worse with Bell.
[3006.62 --> 3007.20]  It shouldn't be.
[3007.26 --> 3007.88]  They share towers.
[3008.38 --> 3008.64]  Really?
[3008.82 --> 3009.06]  Yeah.
[3009.32 --> 3011.32]  It's noticeably slightly worse in certain areas.
[3011.34 --> 3013.06]  Bell shares towers with TELUS in the east,
[3013.54 --> 3015.38]  and TELUS shares towers with Bell in the west.
[3016.56 --> 3017.32]  That's really weird.
[3017.38 --> 3017.54]  Yeah.
[3017.88 --> 3019.28]  It's worse at my parents' house,
[3019.34 --> 3020.08]  and it's worse at...
[3020.08 --> 3020.88]  Actually, that's not true.
[3020.88 --> 3022.48]  It's worse in one part of my house,
[3022.54 --> 3023.42]  and it's better in the other.
[3023.68 --> 3025.16]  It could be your phone, too.
[3025.66 --> 3026.34]  That's very possible.
[3026.34 --> 3027.54]  Something that almost no one...
[3027.54 --> 3028.02]  It's really funny.
[3028.88 --> 3031.38]  Almost no one covers this in phone reviews anymore
[3031.38 --> 3033.58]  because reception is, for the most part, fine.
[3034.14 --> 3036.54]  But the Droid Turbo has terrible reception,
[3036.92 --> 3038.04]  at least for me,
[3038.40 --> 3039.74]  because as a Verizon phone,
[3039.80 --> 3042.54]  I'm not 100% sure if it supports all of Bell's bands.
[3043.04 --> 3043.24]  Yeah.
[3043.38 --> 3045.64]  So that is a major factor.
[3045.64 --> 3046.00]  That could totally be it,
[3046.08 --> 3047.02]  because, like I said,
[3047.12 --> 3049.70]  in part of my house where my phone straight up didn't work before,
[3050.00 --> 3050.70]  it now works.
[3050.98 --> 3051.96]  But in the rest of my house,
[3052.40 --> 3054.32]  it's like it usually works,
[3054.38 --> 3055.14]  but it's kind of sketchy.
[3055.14 --> 3056.14]  Anyway, I mostly...
[3056.76 --> 3057.64]  I like to like Bell
[3057.64 --> 3059.72]  because there's certain things that they do right by me,
[3060.22 --> 3061.88]  but this was not one of them.
[3062.00 --> 3065.32]  So they've got a $1.2 million fine on their hands
[3065.32 --> 3066.88]  from Canada's Competition Bureau
[3066.88 --> 3071.64]  after employees posted fake reviews of Bell apps
[3071.64 --> 3076.60]  on the Apple App Store and on the Google Play Store.
[3079.00 --> 3082.18]  So basically, they had kind of crap ratings
[3082.18 --> 3085.28]  until some employees were,
[3085.80 --> 3087.10]  according to the regulator,
[3087.58 --> 3090.88]  encouraged to post glowing testimonials
[3090.88 --> 3093.76]  of the MyBell and Virgin My Account apps
[3093.76 --> 3095.38]  to both the App Store and Google Play.
[3095.38 --> 3099.32]  So it was exposed by Scott Stratton,
[3099.40 --> 3101.66]  who was aware of the app's poor standing on iTunes,
[3102.14 --> 3104.14]  and he suddenly saw the ratings skyrocket
[3104.14 --> 3105.74]  due to a series of five-star reviews
[3105.74 --> 3107.14]  and then did some digging on LinkedIn,
[3107.60 --> 3109.36]  found out that the most praiseworthy mentions
[3109.36 --> 3111.34]  were directors, marketing managers,
[3111.52 --> 3114.76]  and other paid people by Bell Canada,
[3115.42 --> 3115.86]  and...
[3115.86 --> 3117.02]  This dude was angry.
[3117.16 --> 3117.32]  Yeah.
[3117.48 --> 3119.40]  Forced the company to admit that certain employees
[3119.40 --> 3120.76]  had been encouraged to post the ratings,
[3120.76 --> 3123.30]  but as soon as bosses were made aware,
[3124.30 --> 3126.16]  they ended the practice.
[3127.72 --> 3128.94]  Come on!
[3136.28 --> 3137.18]  That's pretty brutal.
[3137.98 --> 3138.12]  Yeah.
[3138.12 --> 3139.98]  I'm happy that this dude was angry enough
[3139.98 --> 3140.64]  to figure it out.
[3140.84 --> 3142.22]  And I'm glad that this sets a precedent
[3142.22 --> 3143.38]  in Canada for this thing.
[3143.46 --> 3145.28]  This is the first time a company has faced
[3145.28 --> 3148.94]  significant monetary fines for biased reviews in Canada.
[3148.94 --> 3150.56]  And like Linus said,
[3150.56 --> 3151.70]  what, at the beginning of the show
[3151.70 --> 3153.84]  or in the announcement?
[3154.28 --> 3155.90]  I don't even know what it was in, but...
[3155.90 --> 3156.86]  I don't even know what day it is.
[3157.04 --> 3159.20]  The $1.25 million,
[3159.68 --> 3163.40]  which is like just under a million dollars US, I think.
[3164.00 --> 3166.22]  Which would be enough to bankrupt Linus Media Group
[3166.22 --> 3167.56]  and Linus forever.
[3168.14 --> 3168.50]  Yay!
[3168.82 --> 3170.32]  But it's not a drop in the bucket for Bell.
[3170.34 --> 3171.84]  It's not that big of a deal for Bell.
[3171.92 --> 3172.08]  Yeah.
[3172.38 --> 3175.32]  So like, they got their review a little bit higher
[3175.32 --> 3177.34]  and that might have even helped them.
[3178.26 --> 3178.60]  Maybe.
[3179.00 --> 3179.30]  Maybe.
[3179.30 --> 3180.88]  Not to the tune of one point
[3180.88 --> 3182.68]  whatever million dollars, I don't think.
[3183.08 --> 3185.76]  But like, it was a little bit of a gamble
[3185.76 --> 3188.86]  and they lost and oh well, I guess.
[3188.96 --> 3190.52]  And I guess that's the kind of stakes
[3190.52 --> 3191.22]  that you play with
[3191.22 --> 3193.78]  when you're a national telecommunications company.
[3193.98 --> 3194.20]  Yeah.
[3194.46 --> 3194.90]  Yeah.
[3195.36 --> 3196.82]  It's like, yeah, I'm a high roller.
[3197.06 --> 3198.00]  So whatevs.
[3198.86 --> 3203.14]  Speaking of being a high roller or whatevs,
[3203.34 --> 3205.28]  we have sponsors for the show today.
[3205.34 --> 3205.60]  Yay!
[3205.60 --> 3207.96]  That I'm going to tell you guys about all Hyrule and me.
[3208.06 --> 3210.64]  So Logitech, which you can check out,
[3210.82 --> 3214.76]  the G633 at the link that I am going to provide,
[3215.02 --> 3216.00]  or Luke is going to provide,
[3216.12 --> 3217.80]  I am going to provide to you in chat.
[3217.94 --> 3218.60]  I will do it.
[3218.72 --> 3219.44]  Luke will do it.
[3219.66 --> 3223.50]  You can check out the G633 Artemis Spectrum Headset,
[3223.64 --> 3226.60]  which we actually got an opportunity to check out
[3226.60 --> 3231.14]  at Logitech's facility down in Washington State.
[3231.14 --> 3233.34]  It was Washington or Oregon.
[3233.50 --> 3233.76]  Crap.
[3234.10 --> 3235.52]  I'm not good at U.S. geography,
[3235.82 --> 3237.38]  but we went to a Logitech place.
[3237.50 --> 3238.22]  Luke and Brandon did.
[3238.24 --> 3238.68]  So we went over to the border.
[3238.80 --> 3239.56]  Brandon, where was it?
[3240.24 --> 3240.56]  Portland.
[3241.28 --> 3241.64]  Oregon.
[3241.90 --> 3241.96]  Oregon.
[3241.96 --> 3244.54]  But it was above the line, wasn't it?
[3244.58 --> 3245.56]  We were staying in Portland
[3245.56 --> 3247.80]  and then it was up above, was it not?
[3249.40 --> 3251.14]  Because it was actually somewhere else.
[3251.20 --> 3251.80]  We were staying in Portland.
[3251.88 --> 3252.50]  We took a bus.
[3253.06 --> 3255.28]  So to all the Americans out there making fun of us.
[3255.30 --> 3255.60]  Sorry.
[3255.60 --> 3256.28]  Oh, yeah?
[3256.54 --> 3259.62]  Well, in what order do the Canadian provinces
[3259.62 --> 3261.30]  that are all the same shape go across?
[3261.40 --> 3262.10]  Yeah, that's right.
[3264.44 --> 3265.40]  Bet you didn't know that.
[3265.58 --> 3266.08]  They're not technically all the same.
[3266.12 --> 3266.58]  Yeah, they're not.
[3266.64 --> 3268.14]  No, no, they're not exactly the same shape.
[3268.22 --> 3270.90]  But when you were doing your test or whatever in grade four,
[3271.02 --> 3272.60]  it was, I had trouble.
[3272.80 --> 3275.24]  I couldn't remember which one was shaped like this
[3275.24 --> 3277.12]  and which one was exactly flat.
[3277.48 --> 3278.80]  Mind you, that shouldn't be hard.
[3279.08 --> 3281.60]  The one with the flat lines is the one with the flat surface.
[3283.36 --> 3284.22]  It's kind of true.
[3284.22 --> 3285.14]  Okay.
[3285.72 --> 3288.38]  Nick is apparently watching WAN show instead of doing work
[3288.38 --> 3290.68]  and has told us that it was in Washington.
[3290.92 --> 3291.32]  Camus.
[3291.90 --> 3292.30]  Camus.
[3292.44 --> 3292.64]  Yeah.
[3292.74 --> 3293.92]  That was the name of the place.
[3294.00 --> 3297.66]  Anyway, the 633s feature 7.1 Dolby surround sound
[3297.66 --> 3299.38]  with Logitech's gaming software.
[3300.04 --> 3302.76]  They've got 40 millimeter Pro-G audio drivers.
[3302.86 --> 3304.94]  And to be clear, 40 millimeter is not the important thing.
[3305.00 --> 3307.62]  The size of a driver is not nearly as important as the tuning.
[3307.98 --> 3310.84]  They're compatible with the PC as well as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
[3310.84 --> 3315.20]  and feature adjustable RGB lighting, custom tags, and a cardioid boom mic.
[3315.26 --> 3318.54]  They're also sitting right in front of the set today,
[3318.64 --> 3320.48]  which a couple of you complained about last week.
[3320.56 --> 3322.48]  So we took your complaints and we put them in a fire.
[3322.90 --> 3324.40]  We added colors to your complaints.
[3324.50 --> 3326.00]  We added colors to your complaints.
[3326.00 --> 3330.46]  Also sponsoring the show today is Squarespace.
[3330.94 --> 3331.58]  Build it beautiful.
[3331.64 --> 3332.26]  Thank you.
[3332.66 --> 3336.22]  Your site will look professionally designed regardless of your skill level.
[3336.34 --> 3337.24]  Okay, within reason.
[3337.70 --> 3338.80]  I mean, if you go and like...
[3338.80 --> 3340.36]  You can try to make it bad.
[3340.36 --> 3342.92]  You can change your font to Comic Sans.
[3343.34 --> 3343.62]  Yes.
[3343.74 --> 3346.48]  You can draw all your own images in MS Paint.
[3346.48 --> 3348.88]  Which arguably might make sense for certain websites.
[3348.88 --> 3353.12]  If you're making like a kids crafts website store,
[3353.30 --> 3354.70]  which is possible on Squarespace.
[3355.54 --> 3356.48]  Are you going to straw pull this?
[3356.64 --> 3360.44]  If you're making a kids website that is designed to be like a store or something,
[3360.70 --> 3362.50]  could Comic Sans not make sense there?
[3364.38 --> 3365.62]  I know we hate on it,
[3365.64 --> 3368.78]  but I think it might work in certain scenarios.
[3369.82 --> 3370.86]  I think it might be fine.
[3370.90 --> 3372.48]  I don't have to respond to you.
[3372.60 --> 3373.48]  You know what would be hilarious?
[3373.48 --> 3373.88]  Because...
[3373.88 --> 3374.32]  Hold on.
[3374.60 --> 3375.76]  Because...
[3375.76 --> 3378.28]  The internet is going to take care of it for me.
[3378.28 --> 3380.12]  Really?
[3380.34 --> 3381.28]  What is wrong with you people?
[3381.28 --> 3381.76]  Yeah!
[3383.40 --> 3384.96]  Everything has a voice like it.
[3385.06 --> 3385.42]  Yeah!
[3386.50 --> 3387.58]  Even garbage.
[3387.94 --> 3389.08]  In the trash can.
[3389.10 --> 3389.52]  No!
[3390.38 --> 3391.68]  Go the other way!
[3392.58 --> 3394.04]  Guys, do the right thing.
[3394.62 --> 3395.92]  Do the right thing.
[3396.06 --> 3399.08]  A vote yes for Comic Sans is a vote for Donald Trump.
[3399.76 --> 3400.24]  Wow!
[3401.56 --> 3403.24]  That's not fair at all.
[3403.54 --> 3404.38]  It's not fair at all,
[3404.46 --> 3405.64]  but that's how elections work.
[3405.76 --> 3406.42]  I'm going to win now.
[3406.46 --> 3408.24]  Doesn't that mean you're more like Donald Trump?
[3409.02 --> 3409.38]  No.
[3409.54 --> 3410.78]  Because that's not fair at all.
[3410.92 --> 3412.44]  It has nothing to do with...
[3412.44 --> 3413.64]  You just said some bull crap.
[3413.66 --> 3414.92]  It's just how wrong it is.
[3415.00 --> 3416.62]  I guess we shouldn't be talking about politics.
[3417.02 --> 3419.06]  If someone actually wants to vote for him in here,
[3419.12 --> 3419.86]  that might be rude.
[3421.38 --> 3421.78]  Huh.
[3423.04 --> 3424.54]  We should restart this spot.
[3425.08 --> 3425.38]  What?
[3425.54 --> 3429.20]  No, I think we can all agree that Comic Sans is a joke,
[3429.44 --> 3432.16]  and Donald Trump's campaign is a joke.
[3433.96 --> 3434.36]  What?
[3434.36 --> 3437.38]  We can't all agree on this?
[3438.10 --> 3439.32]  We do not.
[3439.72 --> 3444.44]  Our views are not necessarily shared with aforementioned sponsors.
[3444.58 --> 3445.18]  Yeah, let's start.
[3445.26 --> 3448.46]  We'll start our Squarespace sponsorship spot over again.
[3449.22 --> 3450.06]  So, Squarespace.
[3450.32 --> 3451.00]  Build it beautiful.
[3451.12 --> 3451.60]  Thank you.
[3451.96 --> 3453.86]  Your site will look professionally designed,
[3453.94 --> 3455.32]  regardless of your skill level.
[3455.88 --> 3458.28]  Apparently, Comic Sans can be included with that.
[3458.74 --> 3461.12]  No coding experience is required.
[3461.12 --> 3464.26]  And they have intuitive, easy-to-use tools
[3464.26 --> 3467.86]  and fantastic templates for making your site look great,
[3467.94 --> 3469.86]  whether it's on a phone, on a laptop,
[3470.14 --> 3472.60]  or on a promotional billboard.
[3473.00 --> 3474.88]  It's trusted by millions of people
[3474.88 --> 3477.92]  and some of the most respected brands in the world.
[3478.02 --> 3481.20]  I certainly hope that, like, you know,
[3481.20 --> 3483.54]  the GOP doesn't have, like,
[3483.64 --> 3484.66]  mind you, they don't even like,
[3484.78 --> 3486.02]  okay, sorry, I'm not getting into this.

[3500.44 --> 3501.18]  so whether you're deciding,
[3501.44 --> 3503.06]  whether you're building a store or a blog
[3503.06 --> 3505.12]  or just, like, a personal website
[3505.12 --> 3507.62]  promoting what a fantastic personality you have
[3507.62 --> 3508.86]  that isn't abrasive at all,
[3509.22 --> 3511.52]  you can use squarespace.com.
[3512.42 --> 3515.26]  Which leads us into our final sponsor of the day,
[3515.38 --> 3515.82]  Tunnel Bear.
[3515.86 --> 3516.46]  Tunnel Bear!
[3516.86 --> 3519.74]  The easy-to-use VPN app for mobile and desktop.
[3519.96 --> 3520.74]  Tunnel Bear lets you...
[3520.74 --> 3521.30]  I used it last weekend.
[3522.24 --> 3522.60]  For what?
[3523.20 --> 3525.74]  We wanted to watch a...
[3525.74 --> 3526.30]  What was it?
[3526.38 --> 3527.06]  Key and Peel.
[3527.14 --> 3529.50]  I wanted to watch something from Key and Peel on YouTube,
[3529.82 --> 3531.40]  and it's locked off from Canada,
[3531.60 --> 3532.16]  and I was like,
[3532.22 --> 3534.60]  I just want to watch one video.
[3535.82 --> 3536.72]  Come on.
[3536.72 --> 3538.24]  It's on YouTube.
[3539.38 --> 3541.06]  And Tunnel Bear's great for that
[3541.06 --> 3544.42]  because you can actually get 500 megabytes of data
[3544.42 --> 3546.08]  for free,
[3546.22 --> 3547.46]  no credit card required,
[3547.64 --> 3550.66]  by heading over to tunnelbear.com slash LTT.
[3551.00 --> 3552.36]  Then if you decide you like it,
[3552.44 --> 3555.18]  you can tunnel to 16 different countries.
[3555.64 --> 3557.74]  They have apps for iOS, Android, PC, and Mac,
[3557.78 --> 3559.02]  and also a Chrome extension.
[3559.58 --> 3561.16]  The apps are easy to use,
[3561.24 --> 3564.70]  and their support bears are available to help you
[3564.70 --> 3566.08]  if you have any trouble.
[3566.08 --> 3568.70]  Well, then their plans start at...
[3568.70 --> 3571.40]  Why isn't the plan start at a mountain here?
[3571.84 --> 3573.56]  What happened to my Tunnel Bear notes?
[3574.62 --> 3576.24]  Your Tunnel Bear notes got wrecked.
[3577.50 --> 3579.68]  Quick, type Tunnel Bear into the browser bar.
[3580.34 --> 3581.36]  Tunnel Bear pricing.
[3583.36 --> 3584.08]  Start at...
[3584.08 --> 3585.06]  Well, they start at free,
[3585.24 --> 3586.14]  so I guess that's true.
[3586.28 --> 3587.36]  Well, that's the 500...
[3587.36 --> 3589.34]  But the paid plans start at $6.99 a month.
[3589.44 --> 3591.34]  Also, you can get a bonus one gig of free data
[3591.34 --> 3593.58]  by participating in their Twitter promotion.
[3594.84 --> 3596.30]  Yeah, but that's billed yearly.
[3596.78 --> 3596.92]  Oh.
[3597.38 --> 3597.72]  Yeah, yeah.
[3597.90 --> 3598.32]  Yeah, yeah.
[3598.62 --> 3601.78]  Okay, so that's tunnelbear.com slash LTT.
[3601.78 --> 3602.10]  Let's see.
[3602.74 --> 3603.02]  Yeah.
[3603.90 --> 3606.72]  So let's head into our next topic.
[3606.80 --> 3608.00]  What other topics do you want to do today?
[3608.00 --> 3608.74]  Should we do the other stuff?
[3609.00 --> 3609.80]  There's bill logs.
[3609.94 --> 3611.92]  There's also a Star Citizen call-out
[3611.92 --> 3613.02]  that I would like to do.
[3614.60 --> 3615.68]  Did you just do something?
[3615.92 --> 3616.78]  Did we do something wrong?
[3616.84 --> 3617.58]  No, no, no, no.
[3617.62 --> 3618.12]  Nick's like,
[3618.48 --> 3619.64]  Yeah, sorry I forgot.
[3619.76 --> 3620.20]  My bad.
[3620.26 --> 3621.18]  Please don't fire me.
[3621.32 --> 3622.18]  Something along those lines.
[3622.36 --> 3623.18]  It's going to happen, though.
[3623.18 --> 3623.52]  Yeah.
[3624.26 --> 3625.42]  We'll have to deal with that.
[3625.42 --> 3629.18]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, sorry.
[3629.42 --> 3629.94]  You know what?
[3630.02 --> 3631.50]  I guess we'll have to both be fired
[3631.50 --> 3632.56]  if anyone's going to be fired
[3632.56 --> 3636.60]  because he missed putting the starting prices in the dock
[3636.60 --> 3639.08]  and I missed telling you you can save 10%
[3639.08 --> 3642.18]  if you go to tunnelbear.com slash LTT for your plan.
[3642.48 --> 3643.20]  Oh, I thought you...
[3643.20 --> 3643.34]  Oh.
[3643.70 --> 3644.80]  So we both got wrecked.
[3644.82 --> 3645.46]  I thought you did say that.
[3645.48 --> 3646.10]  Get wrecked, Nick.
[3646.62 --> 3647.26]  You got wrecked.
[3647.28 --> 3648.32]  We'll get wrecked together.
[3648.54 --> 3649.36]  You got wrecked.
[3649.44 --> 3649.96]  All night.
[3653.18 --> 3653.70]  All right.
[3653.72 --> 3655.04]  Okay, we can do bill logs.
[3655.04 --> 3656.02]  Bill logs, bill logs.
[3656.20 --> 3657.18]  Let's do the Uber thing.
[3657.26 --> 3657.68]  That's cool.
[3657.86 --> 3658.32]  Uber thing?
[3658.54 --> 3660.28]  Yeah, original article here is from TechCrunch
[3660.28 --> 3663.24]  and this is some pretty freaking Smurf stuff right here.
[3663.78 --> 3665.72]  Uber takes on delivery.
[3665.88 --> 3667.18]  Yeah, Smurf means good.
[3667.42 --> 3667.92]  Don't worry about it.
[3668.86 --> 3670.10]  It's a Family Guy reference.
[3670.22 --> 3670.78]  You wouldn't understand.
[3671.10 --> 3672.56]  Oh, people use it for like gaming.
[3672.76 --> 3674.58]  Like if you're really good and high rank
[3674.58 --> 3675.36]  and you make a new account
[3675.36 --> 3676.58]  so you can play against crappy people,
[3676.64 --> 3677.24]  they call it Smurfing.
[3677.26 --> 3678.30]  I thought that was called Sandbag.
[3679.08 --> 3679.52]  Smurfing.
[3679.88 --> 3680.28]  Sandbagging?
[3680.76 --> 3681.34]  Maybe both.
[3682.30 --> 3683.78]  I think the new kids call it Smurfing.
[3683.78 --> 3684.62]  Smurf.
[3684.68 --> 3685.28]  Yeah, Smurf account.
[3685.34 --> 3686.04]  No, I've heard that before.
[3686.18 --> 3687.38]  I've heard it in that context.
[3687.50 --> 3688.84]  I haven't heard it called Smurfing,
[3689.10 --> 3690.78]  but I've heard it called a Smurf account.
[3691.00 --> 3691.58]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3692.30 --> 3696.60]  Anyway, Uber takes on the package delivery services
[3696.60 --> 3698.00]  with Uber Rush,
[3698.58 --> 3701.38]  an on-demand delivery service.
[3701.64 --> 3702.92]  This looks freaking awesome.
[3703.38 --> 3703.84]  So basically,
[3703.98 --> 3704.90]  they built an infrastructure
[3704.90 --> 3706.36]  of people driving around.
[3706.36 --> 3708.62]  Old chat's like sandbagging.
[3713.78 --> 3715.16]  You're so old.
[3716.76 --> 3717.50]  Hold on.
[3720.84 --> 3721.94]  Oh, you know what?
[3722.28 --> 3722.56]  No.
[3723.46 --> 3727.10]  Sandbagging is deliberately underperforming.
[3727.12 --> 3727.34]  Oh, yeah.
[3727.40 --> 3727.92]  No, this is right.
[3728.02 --> 3728.86]  So having an account
[3728.86 --> 3730.16]  that deliberately underperforms
[3730.16 --> 3731.20]  to gain an unfair advantage
[3731.20 --> 3731.90]  in future matches.
[3731.90 --> 3734.70]  Okay, kind of.
[3734.88 --> 3735.06]  Yeah.
[3735.36 --> 3736.36]  No, the idea, I think,
[3736.40 --> 3736.86]  with Smurfing
[3736.86 --> 3738.04]  is just creating a new one.
[3738.26 --> 3739.90]  Yes, but that would represent...
[3740.68 --> 3742.42]  Your record would not be representative.
[3742.72 --> 3743.08]  Same kind of idea.
[3743.14 --> 3743.90]  It's the same idea.
[3744.56 --> 3744.72]  Yeah.
[3745.08 --> 3746.10]  Sandbagging is a thing,
[3746.30 --> 3746.70]  so you guys can get rekt too.
[3746.70 --> 3747.64]  I think sandbagging is more
[3747.64 --> 3749.34]  if someone has a high-ranked account
[3749.34 --> 3751.56]  and then they repeatedly lose on purpose.
[3751.76 --> 3753.30]  To get seeded against
[3753.30 --> 3753.90]  a more favorable...
[3753.90 --> 3754.18]  Which is another thing that people do.
[3754.18 --> 3755.22]  Yeah, that's definitely a thing.
[3755.28 --> 3757.30]  Actually, one of the most embarrassing examples
[3757.30 --> 3758.14]  of sandbagging
[3758.14 --> 3759.34]  that I ever saw
[3759.34 --> 3760.64]  was the women's...
[3760.64 --> 3762.02]  I think it was like a...
[3762.02 --> 3763.48]  It was women's badminton
[3763.48 --> 3766.92]  in the last Summer Olympics,
[3767.06 --> 3767.64]  I want to say.
[3767.72 --> 3770.52]  2012 throw match.
[3770.64 --> 3771.94]  Something along those lines.
[3772.54 --> 3773.32]  Yeah, here we go.
[3774.06 --> 3776.14]  So this was in...
[3776.94 --> 3778.04]  Oh, bloody hell.
[3779.34 --> 3780.06]  Can't remember.
[3780.20 --> 3781.90]  Anyway, the video is amazing.
[3782.40 --> 3784.16]  It's like professional badminton players
[3784.16 --> 3785.66]  playing on like my level.
[3786.12 --> 3787.74]  Just like not even trying.
[3787.74 --> 3789.40]  And the reason was that
[3789.40 --> 3790.90]  they already knew the results
[3790.90 --> 3792.50]  of another match,
[3792.70 --> 3793.54]  another couple matches,
[3793.62 --> 3794.26]  and they wanted to fall
[3794.26 --> 3795.26]  in a better place in the bracket
[3795.26 --> 3796.18]  so they'd have a better chance
[3796.18 --> 3796.66]  of going through.
[3797.04 --> 3798.06]  Anyway, all the players
[3798.06 --> 3799.06]  ended up getting disqualified,
[3799.38 --> 3800.24]  so get rekt.
[3800.66 --> 3801.60]  Thank you, Olympics,
[3801.72 --> 3802.52]  for being on top of that.
[3802.68 --> 3803.96]  But let's get back to Uber Rush.
[3804.24 --> 3804.46]  Yeah.
[3804.68 --> 3805.78]  So it's a pilot version
[3805.78 --> 3807.36]  of its merchant delivery service
[3807.36 --> 3808.74]  that was launched October 14th
[3809.46 --> 3811.64]  in San Fran, New York, and Chicago.
[3812.10 --> 3813.86]  We still don't even have Uber in Canada
[3813.86 --> 3815.98]  thanks to the taxi mafia.
[3815.98 --> 3818.80]  It's focused on local shops
[3818.80 --> 3819.46]  for the moment,
[3820.14 --> 3823.28]  and it utilizes vehicle
[3823.28 --> 3824.30]  and bike couriers
[3824.30 --> 3825.64]  to deliver things quickly.
[3826.08 --> 3826.86]  So Uber drivers
[3826.86 --> 3827.96]  can pick up passengers
[3827.96 --> 3829.56]  and packages,
[3829.80 --> 3830.84]  but can't do both
[3830.84 --> 3832.52]  at the same time.
[3833.06 --> 3834.58]  So businesses basically
[3834.58 --> 3835.68]  don't have to pay Uber
[3835.68 --> 3836.70]  to sign up for Uber Rush,
[3836.76 --> 3837.42]  but each delivery
[3837.42 --> 3838.26]  will cost the merchant
[3838.26 --> 3839.22]  between $5 and $7,
[3839.52 --> 3840.52]  which is not bad
[3840.52 --> 3841.44]  when you consider
[3841.44 --> 3843.30]  that it happens right away.
[3843.30 --> 3844.76]  So Business Insider
[3844.76 --> 3846.36]  tried the New York City pilot,
[3846.52 --> 3847.78]  and a reporter had a raincoat
[3847.78 --> 3848.74]  she forgot at a meeting
[3848.74 --> 3850.04]  and picked it up
[3850.04 --> 3850.68]  and dropped it off,
[3850.74 --> 3851.32]  and it was picked up
[3851.32 --> 3851.82]  and dropped off
[3851.82 --> 3852.58]  within 20 minutes
[3852.58 --> 3853.08]  for $11.
[3853.90 --> 3854.24]  Wow.
[3854.50 --> 3855.08]  Pretty cool, hey?
[3855.16 --> 3855.94]  That's not bad at all.
[3856.72 --> 3857.32]  So yeah.
[3858.34 --> 3859.02]  That's pretty cool.
[3859.04 --> 3859.34]  That's awesome.
[3859.42 --> 3860.78]  I just wish we had Uber at all!
[3861.04 --> 3861.36]  Yeah.
[3861.76 --> 3862.68]  Even slightly
[3862.68 --> 3863.56]  would be nice.
[3863.74 --> 3863.98]  Yeah.
[3863.98 --> 3866.70]  This is like
[3866.70 --> 3868.52]  the shittiest news ever,
[3869.06 --> 3870.24]  but basically
[3870.24 --> 3872.58]  John TotalBiscuit Bane
[3872.58 --> 3873.98]  has
[3873.98 --> 3875.52]  has
[3875.52 --> 3876.20]  whoops,
[3876.28 --> 3877.58]  that's the wrong thing,
[3877.90 --> 3878.86]  has released a statement
[3878.86 --> 3879.58]  on Twitter
[3879.58 --> 3881.56]  that basically says
[3881.56 --> 3882.76]  his cancer is back.
[3882.94 --> 3883.66]  So I don't know
[3883.66 --> 3884.32]  if all of you
[3884.32 --> 3885.48]  are necessarily familiar
[3885.48 --> 3886.40]  with TotalBiscuit,
[3886.52 --> 3887.88]  but you probably should be.
[3888.34 --> 3889.06]  Yeah, I know.
[3889.44 --> 3890.62]  You probably should be.
[3890.72 --> 3891.48]  We've had him as a guest
[3891.48 --> 3892.54]  on WEN's show before
[3892.54 --> 3893.58]  where he was awesome,
[3893.66 --> 3894.16]  by the way,
[3894.26 --> 3895.06]  but he's awesome
[3895.06 --> 3896.00]  at a lot more things
[3896.00 --> 3897.30]  than just being a guest
[3897.30 --> 3898.02]  on WEN's show.
[3898.54 --> 3899.30]  Solid dude,
[3899.46 --> 3900.30]  upstanding dude,
[3900.80 --> 3903.68]  has really changed
[3903.68 --> 3904.60]  games journalism
[3904.60 --> 3906.22]  in a way that goes beyond
[3906.22 --> 3907.32]  how many subscribers
[3907.32 --> 3908.46]  he has on YouTube.
[3910.16 --> 3912.94]  And the long and short of it
[3912.94 --> 3914.50]  is the average life expectancy
[3914.50 --> 3915.54]  for the condition
[3915.54 --> 3916.56]  that he's in right now
[3916.56 --> 3917.58]  is two to three years.
[3917.72 --> 3918.10]  However,
[3918.68 --> 3919.86]  that is based on
[3919.86 --> 3920.76]  that the condition
[3920.76 --> 3921.78]  that he's in
[3921.78 --> 3924.58]  is usually found
[3924.58 --> 3925.50]  in older people
[3925.50 --> 3926.80]  who are less capable
[3926.80 --> 3927.62]  of fighting it.
[3928.10 --> 3928.74]  So, you know,
[3929.02 --> 3930.32]  he's hoping for the best
[3930.32 --> 3930.98]  and who knows
[3930.98 --> 3931.88]  what cancer treatments
[3931.88 --> 3932.68]  are going to be available
[3932.68 --> 3933.26]  in the next,
[3933.66 --> 3934.18]  who knows,
[3934.22 --> 3935.20]  even two to three years.
[3935.72 --> 3935.88]  You know,
[3935.92 --> 3936.52]  hopefully he's got
[3936.52 --> 3937.26]  a fighting chance,
[3937.40 --> 3939.50]  but it's back.
[3939.70 --> 3940.12]  So we just,
[3940.82 --> 3943.06]  we're talking about that,
[3943.10 --> 3944.00]  not because it's tech news
[3944.00 --> 3944.50]  necessarily,
[3944.68 --> 3945.28]  but just because
[3945.28 --> 3947.40]  it's a bummer.
[3948.74 --> 3950.14]  Check out TotalBiscuit
[3950.14 --> 3951.14]  while you can,
[3951.14 --> 3952.28]  but we are still,
[3952.40 --> 3953.76]  still really hoping
[3953.76 --> 3954.62]  for the best for him.
[3954.94 --> 3955.82]  And, yeah.
[3956.78 --> 3957.94]  Also, he's closing
[3957.94 --> 3959.32]  his StarCraft II team,
[3959.40 --> 3959.84]  Axiom.
[3960.78 --> 3961.42]  This was,
[3961.46 --> 3962.02]  this was another,
[3962.20 --> 3962.88]  there's a screen grab
[3962.88 --> 3963.76]  of the full announcement
[3963.76 --> 3965.80]  that I can pull up here.
[3966.32 --> 3967.18]  But basically,
[3967.38 --> 3967.54]  it's,
[3967.54 --> 3967.78]  it's,
[3967.84 --> 3968.82]  it's come to an end.
[3968.82 --> 3970.40]  The Axiom website is down.
[3970.80 --> 3971.86]  They hadn't been having
[3971.86 --> 3972.44]  a great run
[3972.44 --> 3973.50]  in terms of competitiveness
[3973.50 --> 3974.62]  for a variety of reasons
[3974.62 --> 3975.76]  over the last little bit anyway.
[3976.56 --> 3976.80]  But,
[3976.92 --> 3978.08]  in light of,
[3978.16 --> 3979.26]  in light of what's going on
[3979.26 --> 3979.62]  in,
[3979.62 --> 3980.70]  in John's life,
[3981.10 --> 3983.04]  yeah,
[3983.12 --> 3984.76]  he's focusing more on family
[3984.76 --> 3985.88]  and medical expenses
[3985.88 --> 3986.40]  at the moment.
[3986.92 --> 3987.02]  So.
[3987.42 --> 3988.28]  This super sucks.
[3988.70 --> 3989.68]  Not only do I like him
[3989.68 --> 3990.28]  as a person,
[3990.40 --> 3991.20]  having him on the show
[3991.20 --> 3991.86]  and talking to him
[3991.86 --> 3992.52]  outside of the show
[3992.52 --> 3992.94]  and stuff,
[3993.08 --> 3994.60]  but I literally watch
[3994.60 --> 3995.78]  everything he releases.
[3996.12 --> 3997.46]  I had never talked to him
[3997.46 --> 3998.48]  before we had him
[3998.48 --> 3999.24]  on the show actually,
[3999.34 --> 4000.10]  which is kind of funny
[4000.10 --> 4001.88]  because I just like,
[4001.94 --> 4002.68]  I had talked to him
[4002.68 --> 4004.12]  at shows as a fan
[4004.12 --> 4004.90]  without him knowing
[4004.90 --> 4005.40]  who I was,
[4005.44 --> 4005.80]  I think.
[4005.80 --> 4006.32]  Right.
[4006.92 --> 4007.36]  So,
[4007.64 --> 4008.40]  I hadn't done that,
[4008.48 --> 4009.00]  but I've actually
[4009.00 --> 4009.86]  stayed in touch with him
[4009.86 --> 4010.60]  since we had him
[4010.60 --> 4011.02]  on the show
[4011.02 --> 4012.02]  almost two years ago.
[4013.04 --> 4013.18]  Like,
[4013.46 --> 4013.90]  yeah.
[4014.96 --> 4015.26]  Yeah.
[4016.52 --> 4016.96]  So,
[4017.28 --> 4019.06]  let's move on
[4019.06 --> 4021.54]  to something else,
[4021.72 --> 4022.32]  I guess.
[4024.38 --> 4025.24]  Build logs?
[4025.94 --> 4026.38]  Sure.
[4027.08 --> 4027.52]  Let's do,
[4027.52 --> 4028.34]  let's do build logs.
[4028.34 --> 4031.64]  So,
[4031.72 --> 4032.22]  we actually haven't
[4032.22 --> 4033.40]  done this in a long time,
[4033.54 --> 4034.34]  but on the Linus
[4034.34 --> 4035.10]  Tech Tips Forum,
[4035.28 --> 4036.20]  folks can create,
[4036.28 --> 4036.78]  I'm actually going to
[4036.78 --> 4037.86]  move us out of the way here,
[4038.24 --> 4039.58]  folks can submit
[4039.58 --> 4040.94]  their build logs,
[4041.02 --> 4042.04]  so logs of their build.
[4043.50 --> 4044.58]  Pretty self-explanatory.
[4044.90 --> 4045.50]  I would recommend
[4045.50 --> 4046.38]  full screening it
[4046.38 --> 4046.94]  if you can.
[4047.02 --> 4047.42]  Oh,
[4047.72 --> 4048.14]  okay.
[4048.38 --> 4048.96]  Button is,
[4049.20 --> 4050.48]  there we go.
[4051.26 --> 4051.66]  Yes,
[4051.70 --> 4051.96]  allow.
[4052.18 --> 4053.02]  Why would I click full screen
[4053.02 --> 4053.52]  if I don't want it
[4053.52 --> 4053.96]  to allow it?
[4054.42 --> 4054.80]  So,
[4054.86 --> 4055.22]  basically,
[4055.50 --> 4056.74]  voters can,
[4057.18 --> 4058.24]  staff or community
[4058.24 --> 4058.92]  can pick ones
[4058.92 --> 4059.40]  that they like
[4059.40 --> 4059.96]  and then they can be
[4059.96 --> 4060.66]  featured on the show.
[4060.96 --> 4061.92]  At least that was the theory,
[4062.02 --> 4062.68]  we stopped doing it
[4062.68 --> 4063.32]  for a long time
[4063.32 --> 4064.18]  because we forgot.
[4064.74 --> 4065.10]  So,
[4065.18 --> 4066.12]  this one looks
[4066.12 --> 4067.38]  absolutely sick.
[4068.14 --> 4068.90]  Check out that
[4068.90 --> 4069.98]  custom backplate
[4069.98 --> 4070.50]  for the graphics card.
[4070.52 --> 4070.86]  Do you know what
[4070.86 --> 4072.10]  that skyline is?
[4072.98 --> 4073.68]  The skyline?
[4073.82 --> 4074.10]  Yeah.
[4074.26 --> 4074.78]  I'm not sure.
[4075.58 --> 4076.34]  Because I recognize
[4076.34 --> 4077.38]  like the needle
[4077.38 --> 4078.12]  on the far left.
[4078.72 --> 4078.94]  Yeah,
[4078.96 --> 4079.36]  I'm not sure.
[4079.38 --> 4079.96]  But I don't know
[4079.96 --> 4080.74]  off the top of my head.
[4080.86 --> 4081.66]  Someone's going to tell us
[4081.66 --> 4082.22]  what a bunch of idiots
[4082.22 --> 4083.48]  we are and they're going to know,
[4083.48 --> 4084.12]  but I don't,
[4084.22 --> 4084.32]  so.
[4084.38 --> 4084.60]  Yeah.
[4086.10 --> 4087.22]  Absolutely gorgeous.
[4087.38 --> 4087.76]  Look at that.
[4087.76 --> 4089.24]  It reminds me of Sniff.
[4090.80 --> 4091.70]  It's not Sniff,
[4091.78 --> 4092.62]  but it reminds me of Sniff.
[4093.50 --> 4094.96]  That just looks fantastic.
[4095.16 --> 4095.88]  I sure wish
[4095.88 --> 4097.04]  that this coolant
[4097.04 --> 4097.56]  made sense
[4097.56 --> 4098.56]  for anything other than
[4098.56 --> 4099.50]  like glam footage
[4099.50 --> 4099.96]  of systems.
[4100.34 --> 4100.54]  Yeah, yeah.
[4100.58 --> 4100.96]  You know that
[4100.96 --> 4101.62]  if you turn your system
[4101.62 --> 4102.24]  off for a while,
[4102.32 --> 4102.76]  it settles
[4102.76 --> 4103.76]  and then like goops up,
[4103.86 --> 4104.00]  right?
[4104.72 --> 4105.06]  So,
[4105.14 --> 4105.76]  you have to literally
[4105.76 --> 4106.44]  run your system
[4106.44 --> 4107.12]  like pretty much
[4107.12 --> 4107.62]  continuously.
[4108.54 --> 4109.06]  Someone in the chat
[4109.06 --> 4109.42]  was like,
[4109.48 --> 4110.30]  I don't like Luke.
[4110.44 --> 4111.34]  One time he forgot
[4111.34 --> 4111.96]  who the actor
[4111.96 --> 4113.08]  who played Han Solo was.
[4113.08 --> 4114.74]  I don't like Luke either.
[4117.26 --> 4117.70]  Yeah,
[4117.78 --> 4118.36]  and you probably
[4118.36 --> 4118.94]  don't even know
[4118.94 --> 4120.14]  that that's a somewhat
[4120.14 --> 4121.78]  roundabout Star Wars reference.
[4122.00 --> 4122.18]  I know.
[4123.24 --> 4123.90]  I know.
[4124.56 --> 4125.20]  Do you?
[4125.30 --> 4125.98]  I did know.
[4126.02 --> 4126.54]  Do you?
[4126.54 --> 4127.46]  You jerk!
[4128.30 --> 4128.62]  So,
[4128.72 --> 4129.78]  this is the second one.
[4130.02 --> 4130.14]  So,
[4130.22 --> 4130.72]  that was what?
[4130.78 --> 4131.62]  That was voters pick.
[4131.70 --> 4132.94]  I think this is now
[4132.94 --> 4133.90]  the
[4133.90 --> 4136.08]  like mod teams pick.
[4136.08 --> 4136.96]  But don't talk trash
[4136.96 --> 4137.38]  about Luke
[4137.38 --> 4137.86]  because he'll rip
[4137.86 --> 4138.46]  your arms off.
[4140.88 --> 4142.02]  Just like when he loses.
[4143.90 --> 4144.68]  You're referencing
[4144.68 --> 4145.32]  the wrong person.
[4145.52 --> 4146.14]  Is that the whole point?
[4146.24 --> 4146.42]  No,
[4146.54 --> 4146.70]  yeah,
[4146.74 --> 4147.74]  it's just a Star Wars reference.
[4147.86 --> 4147.96]  Yeah,
[4148.00 --> 4148.16]  okay,
[4148.22 --> 4148.88]  but you're saying Luke.
[4149.52 --> 4149.84]  What?
[4151.20 --> 4152.36]  Who is in Star Wars.
[4152.38 --> 4153.56]  Even the previous reference
[4153.56 --> 4154.46]  was not Luke.
[4154.54 --> 4155.36]  It was Dr.
[4155.44 --> 4156.40]  Whatever His Face Is.
[4157.10 --> 4157.92]  But isn't he saying
[4157.92 --> 4158.48]  that towards...
[4158.48 --> 4158.64]  Yeah,
[4158.64 --> 4159.68]  he is saying that to Luke,
[4159.74 --> 4160.00]  I guess.
[4160.14 --> 4160.68]  You got that.
[4160.72 --> 4161.72]  What you talking about,
[4162.16 --> 4162.52]  son?
[4162.52 --> 4165.88]  That's not a reference
[4165.88 --> 4166.22]  to anything.
[4167.12 --> 4167.88]  Hold on a second.
[4168.00 --> 4168.84]  Who is that line
[4168.84 --> 4169.42]  delivered to?
[4169.54 --> 4170.60]  He doesn't like you very much?
[4170.66 --> 4171.02]  Is that what you're talking about?
[4171.02 --> 4171.20]  No,
[4171.22 --> 4171.32]  yeah,
[4171.38 --> 4172.24]  that one's to Luke.
[4172.36 --> 4173.86]  But who is Han
[4173.86 --> 4174.76]  telling that a Wookiee...
[4174.76 --> 4174.88]  No,
[4174.94 --> 4175.40]  it's C-3PO.
[4175.52 --> 4175.82]  That's right.
[4177.30 --> 4178.12]  But he's talking
[4178.12 --> 4179.40]  about the Wookiee.
[4179.60 --> 4179.92]  No,
[4180.00 --> 4180.12]  no,
[4180.22 --> 4180.38]  no,
[4180.48 --> 4180.56]  no,
[4180.56 --> 4180.62]  no.
[4181.06 --> 4181.38]  Okay,
[4181.50 --> 4181.84]  yes.
[4182.18 --> 4183.52]  Han is talking
[4183.52 --> 4184.68]  to C-3PO
[4184.68 --> 4185.80]  about Chewbacca.
[4186.26 --> 4186.78]  The Wookiee's name
[4186.78 --> 4187.26]  is Chewbacca.
[4187.30 --> 4187.64]  I know.
[4187.90 --> 4188.72]  You said Wookiee
[4188.72 --> 4189.26]  right there.
[4189.28 --> 4189.74]  I don't know
[4189.74 --> 4190.66]  if you know these things.
[4190.96 --> 4191.28]  Jerk,
[4191.28 --> 4191.32]  jerk.
[4192.52 --> 4193.28]  I knew the character
[4193.28 --> 4193.76]  in the show.
[4193.84 --> 4194.70]  I didn't know the actor.
[4194.84 --> 4195.82]  So here's our staff picture.
[4196.36 --> 4197.24]  And I do...
[4197.24 --> 4199.10]  Wow.
[4199.84 --> 4200.32]  You'll see.
[4200.44 --> 4201.00]  I've got wood.
[4201.60 --> 4201.92]  Yes,
[4202.20 --> 4202.62]  basically.
[4203.80 --> 4204.60]  Check that out.
[4204.60 --> 4205.60]  Look at that bottom picture.
[4205.78 --> 4206.52]  I'm liking it.
[4206.56 --> 4207.30]  That's pretty sick.
[4207.66 --> 4208.34]  That's fantastic.
[4208.34 --> 4208.96]  So he took like
[4208.96 --> 4209.86]  the actual front grill
[4209.86 --> 4210.86]  off of some case.
[4211.12 --> 4212.00]  Nice and compact.
[4212.56 --> 4213.56]  Looking pretty good.
[4213.68 --> 4214.22]  I think it's cool.
[4215.10 --> 4215.42]  All right,
[4215.44 --> 4216.54]  we got one more here.
[4217.76 --> 4219.06]  So this is the
[4219.06 --> 4219.58]  like
[4219.58 --> 4222.20]  wild card
[4222.20 --> 4224.00]  got picked
[4224.00 --> 4224.46]  because
[4224.46 --> 4225.14]  holy crap,
[4225.24 --> 4225.68]  what the hell
[4225.68 --> 4226.56]  system.
[4227.84 --> 4228.42]  All right.
[4228.78 --> 4229.72]  So this is it.
[4229.82 --> 4230.64]  I think this is the only
[4230.64 --> 4231.24]  photo there is.
[4231.24 --> 4231.34]  Nice.
[4231.34 --> 4231.74]  Nice.
[4231.74 --> 4233.12]  So he has a computer,
[4233.34 --> 4234.06]  an Xbox 360,
[4234.18 --> 4234.86]  a PlayStation 3,
[4234.96 --> 4235.86]  and a PlayStation 4
[4235.86 --> 4236.84]  all water cooled
[4236.84 --> 4237.60]  on one loop.
[4238.76 --> 4239.24]  Wow.
[4239.92 --> 4240.32]  Yeah.
[4240.58 --> 4241.60]  That's fantastic.
[4242.10 --> 4242.44]  Yeah.
[4243.94 --> 4244.60]  Well, I mean,
[4244.62 --> 4245.34]  you'd only really use
[4245.34 --> 4245.70]  one of them,
[4245.82 --> 4246.08]  but
[4246.08 --> 4246.96]  it is pretty cool.
[4246.96 --> 4247.20]  Yeah.
[4247.34 --> 4247.88]  But I mean,
[4247.94 --> 4248.76]  having those there
[4248.76 --> 4249.38]  for like,
[4249.96 --> 4250.24]  you know,
[4250.30 --> 4251.32]  look at how inferior
[4251.32 --> 4252.52]  these ones look.
[4253.04 --> 4254.66]  Museum archival purposes.
[4255.10 --> 4255.20]  No,
[4255.24 --> 4256.10]  my favorite part is too,
[4256.20 --> 4257.22]  is all the PC components
[4257.22 --> 4258.16]  like color match
[4258.16 --> 4259.18]  the board and stuff.
[4259.40 --> 4260.42]  And then it's like,
[4260.50 --> 4260.68]  oh,
[4260.86 --> 4262.00]  green grossness.
[4262.32 --> 4262.54]  Yeah.
[4262.56 --> 4263.42]  Here's some ugly
[4263.42 --> 4264.64]  PCBs I ripped out
[4264.64 --> 4265.60]  of some like
[4265.60 --> 4268.14]  turd boxes
[4268.14 --> 4268.70]  or whatever.
[4269.42 --> 4269.72]  Okay.
[4269.72 --> 4270.30]  To be fair,
[4270.40 --> 4271.56]  we have actually said
[4271.56 --> 4272.58]  that the PlayStation 4
[4272.58 --> 4273.38]  was not terrible
[4273.38 --> 4273.90]  at launch.
[4273.90 --> 4275.48]  And if you want to play
[4275.48 --> 4276.16]  exclusive titles,
[4276.40 --> 4276.66]  I get it.
[4276.66 --> 4276.68]  At launch.
[4276.78 --> 4277.52]  And now you can like
[4277.52 --> 4278.76]  kick its ass.
[4279.00 --> 4279.80]  Well, yeah, but.
[4280.14 --> 4281.06]  Like all this
[4281.06 --> 4281.92]  Craftyard Wars stuff
[4281.92 --> 4282.46]  that went down.
[4282.64 --> 4283.20]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[4283.52 --> 4284.48]  When you guys see
[4284.48 --> 4285.20]  the new one.
[4286.82 --> 4287.42]  Yeah, it's going to be awesome.
[4287.42 --> 4288.06]  It's even like,
[4288.66 --> 4289.68]  yeah, I don't know.
[4289.76 --> 4290.84]  The result is very cool.
[4290.98 --> 4291.38]  All right.
[4291.42 --> 4292.78]  So the Scarp raised
[4292.78 --> 4294.54]  four million dollars
[4294.54 --> 4296.46]  before having its funding
[4296.46 --> 4297.36]  suspended
[4297.36 --> 4298.94]  for not having
[4298.94 --> 4299.90]  a working prototype.
[4300.12 --> 4300.64]  And oh, man,
[4300.68 --> 4301.66]  did they ever try
[4301.66 --> 4303.28]  to sell people
[4303.28 --> 4304.24]  on the idea
[4304.24 --> 4304.84]  that the footage
[4304.84 --> 4305.44]  they were showing
[4305.44 --> 4305.98]  was somehow
[4305.98 --> 4306.68]  a working prototype?
[4306.82 --> 4307.72]  It was not.
[4307.84 --> 4308.40]  It was not even
[4308.40 --> 4309.08]  remotely a working prototype.
[4309.08 --> 4309.64]  It was not.
[4309.84 --> 4311.70]  I am frankly
[4311.70 --> 4312.88]  a little disappointed
[4312.88 --> 4313.62]  that we talked
[4313.62 --> 4314.28]  about this thing.
[4314.42 --> 4315.88]  See, this is why
[4315.88 --> 4316.82]  every time we get
[4316.82 --> 4317.72]  burned on this crap,
[4317.86 --> 4318.24]  I'm like,
[4318.44 --> 4318.78]  you know what?
[4318.80 --> 4319.36]  We should just not
[4319.36 --> 4320.64]  cover Kickstarter stuff anymore.
[4321.06 --> 4321.50]  You know what?
[4321.52 --> 4322.20]  We should just stop
[4322.20 --> 4323.36]  covering Kickstarter stuff.
[4323.36 --> 4324.12]  But then we get
[4324.12 --> 4325.32]  to cover this part of it.
[4325.40 --> 4325.88]  And then there's
[4325.88 --> 4327.08]  like some cool thing.
[4327.10 --> 4327.86]  So every single thing
[4327.86 --> 4328.26]  that we cover
[4328.26 --> 4328.68]  in Kickstarter
[4328.68 --> 4329.92]  is two topics.
[4331.82 --> 4333.14]  We can put it that way.
[4333.28 --> 4334.88]  We're getting great mileage
[4334.88 --> 4335.98]  out of these topics.
[4336.00 --> 4336.90]  We are, yeah.
[4337.14 --> 4337.64]  They're amazing.
[4337.74 --> 4338.26]  And then we already
[4338.26 --> 4339.40]  know everything about it
[4339.40 --> 4340.00]  next time we have
[4340.00 --> 4340.62]  to cover it.
[4342.00 --> 4343.16]  I think we should
[4343.16 --> 4344.70]  only cover Kickstarter stuff.
[4345.18 --> 4345.82]  Then we only have
[4345.82 --> 4346.56]  to prep a show
[4346.56 --> 4348.12]  twice a month.
[4348.60 --> 4349.28]  So more than
[4349.28 --> 4350.48]  20,000 people
[4350.48 --> 4351.66]  had backed the project.
[4353.08 --> 4354.00]  There's a great
[4354.00 --> 4354.50]  Reddit thread
[4354.50 --> 4354.90]  that you guys
[4354.90 --> 4355.46]  should read through
[4355.46 --> 4356.48]  about all the reasons
[4356.48 --> 4357.92]  why what they were doing
[4357.92 --> 4359.56]  probably doesn't
[4359.56 --> 4362.58]  or perhaps could work.
[4362.58 --> 4364.20]  the people digging
[4364.20 --> 4365.68]  into the alleged
[4365.68 --> 4366.38]  credibility
[4366.38 --> 4367.64]  of the people involved
[4367.64 --> 4369.76]  versus what they were
[4369.76 --> 4370.60]  saying their credibility
[4370.60 --> 4371.02]  was.
[4371.10 --> 4372.02]  People picking apart
[4372.02 --> 4372.90]  some of the footage
[4372.90 --> 4374.22]  and why it may or may
[4374.22 --> 4374.92]  not have had a filter
[4374.92 --> 4375.68]  over the lens
[4375.68 --> 4376.82]  or whatever else.
[4378.38 --> 4379.30]  So basically
[4379.30 --> 4384.06]  Super sketch.
[4384.18 --> 4384.80]  It's back up
[4384.80 --> 4385.40]  on Indiegogo.
[4386.06 --> 4387.06]  So there's that.
[4387.56 --> 4387.86]  Yep.
[4388.18 --> 4389.00]  And has raised
[4389.00 --> 4390.60]  300,000 US dollars.
[4390.84 --> 4391.32]  Already.
[4391.48 --> 4391.90]  Already.
[4391.90 --> 4392.40]  Again.
[4392.60 --> 4392.96]  Oh.
[4393.72 --> 4395.18]  So yep.
[4395.56 --> 4396.14]  There you go.
[4396.22 --> 4396.66]  The campaign
[4396.66 --> 4398.00]  will receive all funds
[4398.00 --> 4398.72]  even if it doesn't
[4398.72 --> 4399.34]  reach its goal.
[4399.86 --> 4400.44]  So apparently
[4400.44 --> 4402.28]  if this is a scam
[4402.28 --> 4404.60]  then they've set
[4404.60 --> 4404.96]  their sights
[4404.96 --> 4405.66]  a little lower
[4405.66 --> 4407.20]  but they'll take
[4407.20 --> 4408.08]  the 300 grand.
[4408.30 --> 4408.48]  Yeah.
[4408.58 --> 4409.52]  If it's not a scam
[4409.52 --> 4410.64]  then I do sincerely
[4410.64 --> 4412.42]  hope that it's
[4412.42 --> 4413.08]  I'm glad our logo
[4413.08 --> 4413.52]  is not there.
[4413.80 --> 4415.30]  I do sincerely hope
[4415.30 --> 4416.34]  that it ends up
[4416.34 --> 4417.92]  being real.
[4417.92 --> 4419.90]  I really want it
[4419.90 --> 4420.42]  to be real.
[4421.20 --> 4421.98]  I super do.
[4422.24 --> 4422.94]  They have not put
[4422.94 --> 4423.96]  any acknowledgement.
[4424.20 --> 4425.12]  Have you seen this video?
[4425.48 --> 4425.74]  Yeah.
[4425.98 --> 4427.78]  This crap video.
[4428.02 --> 4428.16]  Yeah.
[4428.26 --> 4429.02]  It's brutal.
[4429.18 --> 4429.58]  They're like
[4429.58 --> 4430.62]  Oh my god.
[4430.74 --> 4431.34]  It's like
[4431.34 --> 4431.82]  they've like
[4431.82 --> 4432.78]  Get someone else
[4432.78 --> 4433.72]  to hold the camera.
[4433.72 --> 4434.84]  They used a Dremel
[4434.84 --> 4435.70]  to like
[4435.70 --> 4436.26]  Yeah.
[4436.68 --> 4437.48]  Cut out a thing
[4437.48 --> 4438.18]  on their prototype
[4438.18 --> 4438.96]  and then they put
[4438.96 --> 4440.52]  like a filament
[4440.52 --> 4441.26]  in here.
[4443.88 --> 4444.70]  It could be
[4444.70 --> 4445.16]  anything.
[4445.70 --> 4446.48]  They don't show us
[4446.48 --> 4447.16]  the power source
[4447.16 --> 4447.76]  so it could be
[4447.76 --> 4448.50]  a AAA battery.
[4448.68 --> 4449.06]  It could be
[4449.06 --> 4450.14]  a nuclear generator.
[4450.42 --> 4450.60]  Yeah.
[4452.04 --> 4453.24]  It's just the worst
[4453.24 --> 4454.10]  shot video
[4454.10 --> 4454.70]  like ever.
[4454.96 --> 4456.26]  Why is it so green?
[4457.54 --> 4458.34]  That's a lens filter
[4458.34 --> 4459.52]  to help you see
[4459.52 --> 4459.90]  something
[4459.90 --> 4460.46]  or something
[4460.46 --> 4461.00]  or something.
[4461.86 --> 4462.30]  Anyway.
[4462.30 --> 4464.54]  There's no audio
[4464.54 --> 4465.42]  if I remember correctly.
[4465.72 --> 4466.38]  The video on YouTube
[4466.38 --> 4467.70]  has ratings disabled
[4467.70 --> 4469.10]  and comments disabled.
[4469.90 --> 4470.18]  Yep.
[4471.50 --> 4472.02]  So
[4472.02 --> 4473.18]  something something
[4473.18 --> 4473.52]  et cetera.
[4473.64 --> 4473.78]  Yeah.
[4473.84 --> 4474.86]  They haven't said
[4474.86 --> 4475.94]  anything about
[4475.94 --> 4478.08]  being kicked off
[4478.08 --> 4478.66]  of Kickstarter
[4478.66 --> 4480.10]  which is really interesting.
[4480.32 --> 4480.42]  Yeah.
[4481.54 --> 4482.92]  Very very interesting.
[4485.04 --> 4485.72]  Well
[4485.72 --> 4487.62]  we'll see how that turns out.
[4490.56 --> 4491.20]  Someone
[4491.20 --> 4492.10]  someone just said
[4492.10 --> 4493.20]  Scraphead Wars 3
[4493.20 --> 4493.88]  should be 4
[4493.88 --> 4494.70]  because 3 is already
[4494.70 --> 4495.18]  coming out.
[4495.44 --> 4496.30]  But Scraphead Wars 3
[4496.30 --> 4497.56]  make a laser razor.
[4504.22 --> 4505.10]  Oh man
[4505.10 --> 4505.80]  that's awesome.
[4506.80 --> 4507.20]  Alright.
[4507.58 --> 4507.82]  So
[4507.82 --> 4509.56]  SuperMHL
[4509.56 --> 4510.84]  is on its way
[4510.84 --> 4511.44]  with support
[4511.44 --> 4512.70]  for 8K
[4512.70 --> 4513.66]  video.
[4513.66 --> 4514.30]  So someone
[4514.30 --> 4515.06]  heard Linus
[4515.06 --> 4515.64]  complaining
[4515.64 --> 4517.02]  about how the heck
[4517.02 --> 4517.74]  you deliver
[4517.74 --> 4518.56]  8K video.
[4518.82 --> 4519.34]  And delivered
[4519.34 --> 4520.28]  SuperMHL.
[4520.28 --> 4520.66]  Yes.
[4520.80 --> 4521.20]  They're like
[4521.20 --> 4521.70]  wow
[4521.70 --> 4522.42]  let's develop
[4522.42 --> 4523.06]  all of this
[4523.06 --> 4523.84]  in less than a week.
[4524.46 --> 4524.68]  Yep.
[4525.56 --> 4525.92]  So
[4525.92 --> 4526.74]  move over
[4526.74 --> 4527.50]  standard mobile
[4527.50 --> 4528.10]  high definition
[4528.10 --> 4528.56]  Linus
[4528.56 --> 4529.76]  SuperMHL
[4529.76 --> 4530.68]  is on its way
[4530.68 --> 4531.24]  and it's bringing
[4531.24 --> 4531.94]  better video
[4531.94 --> 4533.02]  quality and support
[4533.02 --> 4534.34]  than ever before
[4534.34 --> 4535.46]  according to the
[4535.46 --> 4536.14]  subheadline
[4536.14 --> 4537.14]  on CNET.
[4537.14 --> 4538.26]  So the skinny
[4538.26 --> 4538.92]  is this.
[4539.02 --> 4539.44]  Support for
[4539.44 --> 4539.94]  8K
[4539.94 --> 4541.10]  120fps
[4541.10 --> 4545.80]  allows you
[4545.80 --> 4546.12]  to stream
[4546.12 --> 4546.90]  up to 8K
[4546.90 --> 4547.52]  AV content
[4547.52 --> 4547.98]  from a mobile
[4547.98 --> 4548.68]  device to a TV
[4548.68 --> 4549.28]  or other display
[4549.28 --> 4549.68]  and supports
[4549.68 --> 4550.42]  up to 48 bit
[4550.42 --> 4550.64]  color.
[4550.74 --> 4551.36]  Totally unnecessary
[4551.36 --> 4551.92]  by the way.
[4552.40 --> 4553.10]  And launched
[4553.10 --> 4554.02]  at CES 2015
[4554.02 --> 4555.44]  so they actually
[4555.44 --> 4556.52]  went back in time
[4556.52 --> 4557.72]  did all the work
[4557.72 --> 4558.52]  that I asked for
[4558.52 --> 4560.02]  and
[4560.02 --> 4561.26]  That doesn't sound
[4561.26 --> 4561.76]  too complicated.
[4561.92 --> 4562.38]  And someone
[4562.38 --> 4563.30]  sent me the link
[4563.30 --> 4564.30]  just in time
[4564.30 --> 4564.84]  for it to be
[4564.84 --> 4565.76]  after I complained
[4565.76 --> 4566.74]  that it didn't exist yet.
[4567.04 --> 4567.64]  I really like the way
[4567.64 --> 4568.18]  that all of that
[4568.18 --> 4569.06]  timing has worked out here.
[4569.08 --> 4569.16]  Also
[4569.16 --> 4570.28]  wait
[4570.28 --> 4570.76]  yeah
[4570.76 --> 4571.18]  never mind.
[4573.60 --> 4574.44]  This is just
[4574.44 --> 4575.02]  kind of funny.
[4575.40 --> 4576.28]  Wired reports
[4576.28 --> 4577.58]  that Leonardo DiCaprio
[4577.58 --> 4579.04]  has snapped up
[4579.04 --> 4579.68]  film rights
[4579.68 --> 4580.00]  to the
[4580.00 --> 4580.40]  This is cool.
[4580.58 --> 4580.70]  to the
[4580.70 --> 4581.26]  to the
[4581.26 --> 4581.96]  to the
[4581.96 --> 4583.12]  proposed
[4583.12 --> 4584.38]  book
[4584.38 --> 4585.74]  that is not written
[4585.74 --> 4587.08]  about the
[4587.08 --> 4588.30]  VW emissions
[4588.30 --> 4589.32]  scandal.
[4591.00 --> 4591.48]  So
[4591.48 --> 4592.12]  yeah
[4592.12 --> 4593.28]  so they've teamed up
[4593.28 --> 4593.76]  with Paramount
[4593.76 --> 4594.40]  to buy the rights.
[4594.62 --> 4594.70]  Good.
[4595.76 --> 4597.76]  It will apparently
[4597.76 --> 4598.20]  be called
[4598.20 --> 4599.36]  Too Big to Fail
[4599.36 --> 4600.26]  Good.
[4600.40 --> 4600.84]  And it'll be
[4600.84 --> 4601.40]  something about
[4601.40 --> 4601.98]  the impact
[4601.98 --> 4602.72]  on the automotive
[4602.72 --> 4603.28]  industry
[4603.28 --> 4604.66]  of the race
[4604.66 --> 4605.60]  to more specs
[4605.60 --> 4606.26]  and more better
[4606.26 --> 4606.70]  faster
[4606.70 --> 4608.00]  and all that
[4608.00 --> 4608.62]  kind of stuff.
[4609.06 --> 4609.84]  He's also
[4609.84 --> 4610.76]  actually recently
[4610.76 --> 4611.60]  signed a multi-year
[4611.60 --> 4612.30]  deal with Netflix
[4612.30 --> 4612.84]  to produce
[4612.84 --> 4614.10]  environmental films.
[4614.46 --> 4614.66]  Cool.
[4616.34 --> 4616.78]  Good.
[4616.86 --> 4617.28]  There you go.
[4617.68 --> 4617.96]  Cool.
[4618.14 --> 4618.84]  Do good things
[4618.84 --> 4619.42]  DiCaprio.
[4619.60 --> 4620.22]  Way to go Leo.
[4620.70 --> 4621.08]  Yay.
[4621.98 --> 4622.72]  I don't know
[4622.72 --> 4623.26]  that you're actually
[4623.26 --> 4624.06]  a super nice dude
[4624.06 --> 4624.50]  but at least
[4624.50 --> 4625.06]  you're doing this.
[4625.36 --> 4625.64]  Yes.
[4626.42 --> 4627.16]  This is cool.
[4627.24 --> 4628.08]  I actually submitted
[4628.08 --> 4629.46]  a review unit request
[4629.46 --> 4630.94]  got my ass handed
[4630.94 --> 4631.38]  to me.
[4631.50 --> 4631.86]  They're like
[4631.86 --> 4632.84]  yep so we've chosen
[4632.84 --> 4633.94]  I got a form letter back.
[4634.30 --> 4634.70]  They're just like
[4634.70 --> 4635.34]  so we've chosen
[4635.34 --> 4636.32]  some key blah blah
[4636.32 --> 4636.82]  etc.
[4637.10 --> 4638.02]  So you're not getting one
[4638.02 --> 4639.16]  but hey we'll let you know
[4639.16 --> 4641.08]  if there's more later
[4641.08 --> 4641.98]  and also you can have
[4641.98 --> 4642.92]  a discount on buying one
[4642.92 --> 4643.56]  which I'm not doing
[4643.56 --> 4644.04]  because I think
[4644.04 --> 4644.42]  it's going to be
[4644.42 --> 4644.84]  a piece of crap
[4644.84 --> 4646.10]  but this is the
[4646.10 --> 4647.58]  Light L16 camera
[4647.58 --> 4649.58]  and apparently
[4649.58 --> 4651.02]  challenges DSLRs
[4651.02 --> 4652.30]  with 16 lenses
[4652.30 --> 4653.58]  in one package.
[4653.58 --> 4654.84]  So the idea
[4654.84 --> 4656.08]  yes right there
[4656.08 --> 4657.48]  you are looking at
[4657.48 --> 4657.94]  whoa
[4657.94 --> 4658.74]  a camera
[4658.74 --> 4659.84]  that will record
[4659.84 --> 4660.88]  the image
[4660.88 --> 4662.98]  16 different ways
[4662.98 --> 4664.32]  allowing you to
[4664.32 --> 4664.60]  make
[4664.60 --> 4665.40]  That sounds like
[4665.40 --> 4666.20]  a bad idea.
[4666.20 --> 4667.74]  make changes to the image
[4667.74 --> 4668.70]  in terms of focus
[4668.70 --> 4669.72]  in terms of
[4669.72 --> 4671.56]  a bunch of other stuff
[4671.56 --> 4673.22]  after the fact.
[4673.30 --> 4673.82]  Hold on a second
[4673.82 --> 4674.78]  John's trying to leave
[4674.78 --> 4675.20]  the office.
[4675.36 --> 4676.02]  Hold on.
[4676.60 --> 4678.32]  Can you put the sponsor
[4678.32 --> 4679.84]  spots in the scripts
[4679.84 --> 4683.02]  and save them
[4683.02 --> 4684.54]  as .txt?
[4684.94 --> 4685.34]  One.
[4685.46 --> 4685.88]  Thanks.
[4686.56 --> 4687.52]  Wasn't that already
[4687.52 --> 4688.06]  a technology?
[4688.52 --> 4689.16]  Are they claiming
[4689.16 --> 4690.04]  that they invented this?
[4690.58 --> 4691.14]  Are they claiming
[4691.14 --> 4691.84]  they invented this?
[4691.88 --> 4692.02]  Yeah.
[4692.02 --> 4692.42]  I don't think so.
[4692.54 --> 4692.98]  Okay cool.
[4693.48 --> 4693.96]  Two.
[4694.10 --> 4694.74]  That just sounds like
[4694.74 --> 4695.32]  a terrible idea.
[4696.98 --> 4697.42]  Yeah.
[4697.70 --> 4698.62]  I mean I think
[4698.62 --> 4701.48]  the DSLR traditionalists
[4701.48 --> 4702.48]  are going to probably
[4702.48 --> 4703.30]  look at this and go
[4703.30 --> 4704.28]  or you could take
[4704.28 --> 4705.38]  one photo
[4705.38 --> 4706.42]  with a big sensor
[4706.42 --> 4707.34]  and a nice lens
[4707.34 --> 4707.90]  in front of it
[4707.90 --> 4708.46]  properly
[4708.46 --> 4710.02]  the first time.
[4710.12 --> 4710.76]  And then Taren's
[4710.76 --> 4711.22]  going to be like
[4711.22 --> 4712.12]  fix it in post
[4712.12 --> 4712.94]  this is the greatest
[4712.94 --> 4713.86]  camera that's ever
[4713.86 --> 4714.78]  existed because I can
[4714.78 --> 4715.50]  fix it in post
[4715.50 --> 4716.18]  even better.
[4716.86 --> 4717.18]  Ah.
[4717.84 --> 4718.42]  So it'll have
[4718.42 --> 4719.16]  a touchscreen display
[4719.16 --> 4719.84]  on the back
[4719.84 --> 4722.52]  it'll cost about
[4722.52 --> 4724.78]  $1300 on pre-order
[4724.78 --> 4726.02]  and when it starts
[4726.02 --> 4726.50]  shipping in the
[4726.50 --> 4727.22]  summer of 2016
[4727.22 --> 4729.46]  it'll cost $1700
[4729.46 --> 4730.16]  that's assuming
[4730.16 --> 4731.12]  it works at all
[4731.12 --> 4734.76]  and yeah
[4734.76 --> 4735.98]  I guess I'm not
[4735.98 --> 4736.42]  really sure
[4736.42 --> 4737.34]  what else to say
[4737.34 --> 4737.94]  about that.
[4739.18 --> 4739.74]  It's about the size
[4739.74 --> 4740.28]  of an X6
[4740.28 --> 4741.14]  so it's not huge
[4741.14 --> 4741.64]  which is cool.
[4741.90 --> 4742.96]  The UOLTT
[4742.96 --> 4746.62]  or the originally
[4746.62 --> 4747.20]  unofficial
[4747.20 --> 4747.96]  that's what UO
[4747.96 --> 4749.72]  came from Linus Tech Tips
[4749.72 --> 4750.32]  Star Citizen
[4750.32 --> 4751.44]  conglomerate
[4751.44 --> 4753.68]  is going to be
[4753.68 --> 4754.50]  having a tournament
[4754.50 --> 4755.12]  thingy.
[4755.40 --> 4755.78]  There's going to be
[4755.78 --> 4756.70]  giveaways based on
[4756.70 --> 4757.32]  your performance
[4757.32 --> 4758.06]  in the tournament.
[4758.18 --> 4758.70]  The first giveaway
[4758.70 --> 4759.74]  is a $25 gift card
[4759.74 --> 4760.36]  the second place
[4760.36 --> 4761.54]  is a $10 gift card
[4761.54 --> 4762.66]  and the third place
[4762.66 --> 4764.16]  is a $5 item
[4764.16 --> 4765.20]  from the pledge store.
[4765.86 --> 4766.94]  Even if you show up
[4766.94 --> 4767.48]  it's just supposed
[4767.48 --> 4768.30]  to kind of be fun
[4768.30 --> 4768.86]  so don't worry
[4768.86 --> 4769.54]  if you're not very good
[4769.54 --> 4769.96]  at shooting
[4769.96 --> 4771.06]  and blowing stuff up
[4771.06 --> 4772.10]  like me.
[4772.96 --> 4773.70]  I'm usually good
[4773.70 --> 4774.58]  at flying spaceships
[4774.58 --> 4775.30]  and spaceship games
[4775.30 --> 4776.70]  and I'm really bad
[4776.70 --> 4777.46]  at it in Star Citizen
[4777.46 --> 4778.62]  so oh well.
[4779.58 --> 4780.42]  Yeah, there's a thread
[4780.42 --> 4780.98]  on the forum
[4780.98 --> 4781.66]  you should go there
[4781.66 --> 4782.08]  just look up
[4782.08 --> 4782.96]  Operation Brawl
[4782.96 --> 4783.78]  Star Citizen giveaway
[4783.78 --> 4785.04]  and you will find it
[4785.04 --> 4786.58]  it's from Napper198
[4786.58 --> 4787.48]  go check it out
[4787.48 --> 4787.98]  go join
[4787.98 --> 4788.66]  it should be fun.
[4789.94 --> 4790.10]  Yeah.
[4791.38 --> 4792.14]  Wow, we've got
[4792.14 --> 4793.28]  a whole bunch of stuff.
[4793.28 --> 4794.26]  Apple updated
[4794.26 --> 4795.98]  their iMac peripherals
[4795.98 --> 4797.46]  so now there's
[4797.46 --> 4798.84]  the Magic Mouse 2
[4798.84 --> 4800.18]  which features
[4800.18 --> 4801.32]  a charging port
[4801.32 --> 4801.94]  on the bottom
[4801.94 --> 4802.74]  for some reason.
[4803.14 --> 4804.08]  Original article here
[4804.08 --> 4805.24]  is from Anantek
[4805.24 --> 4808.42]  so there you go.
[4808.56 --> 4808.96]  There's also
[4808.96 --> 4810.78]  a new Magic Trackpad 2
[4810.78 --> 4812.36]  so
[4812.36 --> 4814.86]  everyone just
[4814.86 --> 4816.20]  freaked out
[4816.20 --> 4816.80]  about the mouse.
[4816.90 --> 4817.40]  And a Magic
[4817.40 --> 4818.72]  and Magic Keyboard
[4818.72 --> 4820.24]  updated version.
[4820.44 --> 4821.18]  How bad do you think
[4821.18 --> 4821.60]  the mouse is?
[4821.66 --> 4822.12]  Because some people
[4822.12 --> 4822.72]  are just like
[4822.72 --> 4824.24]  atomic over the mouse
[4824.24 --> 4824.84]  having the charging
[4824.84 --> 4825.56]  thingy on the bottom.
[4825.62 --> 4826.82]  I think it's super stupid.
[4828.04 --> 4828.44]  Where would you
[4828.44 --> 4828.94]  rather it went?
[4829.02 --> 4829.72]  Just in the very front?
[4829.72 --> 4830.88]  I liked their
[4830.88 --> 4832.26]  AA battery approach
[4832.26 --> 4832.58]  before.
[4832.74 --> 4833.40]  The great thing
[4833.40 --> 4833.82]  about a mouse
[4833.82 --> 4834.58]  that just takes
[4834.58 --> 4835.32]  AA batteries
[4835.32 --> 4836.66]  is that it will
[4836.66 --> 4837.22]  work forever
[4837.22 --> 4837.90]  because you can
[4837.90 --> 4838.28]  keep putting
[4838.28 --> 4839.04]  new AA batteries
[4839.04 --> 4839.38]  in it.
[4839.86 --> 4840.54]  That doesn't sound
[4840.54 --> 4841.06]  like a very
[4841.06 --> 4842.20]  Apple approach.
[4842.34 --> 4842.68]  And if you're
[4842.68 --> 4843.30]  out of battery
[4843.30 --> 4843.72]  hold on
[4843.72 --> 4844.18]  if you're out
[4844.18 --> 4844.66]  of battery
[4844.66 --> 4845.78]  you don't have
[4845.78 --> 4847.38]  to sit on ass
[4847.38 --> 4847.92]  waiting for it
[4847.92 --> 4848.30]  to charge.
[4848.42 --> 4848.84]  You can throw
[4848.84 --> 4849.64]  in some disposables
[4849.64 --> 4850.82]  if you're in a pinch.
[4850.94 --> 4851.86]  Like we use
[4851.86 --> 4853.78]  98% rechargeable
[4853.78 --> 4854.54]  batteries at Linus
[4854.54 --> 4855.06]  Media Group
[4855.06 --> 4855.92]  but that doesn't
[4855.92 --> 4856.56]  mean that we don't
[4856.56 --> 4857.22]  have a bin of
[4857.22 --> 4858.12]  disposables just in
[4858.12 --> 4858.80]  case we're desperate.
[4859.72 --> 4860.86]  And the other
[4860.86 --> 4861.72]  issue here is
[4861.72 --> 4863.40]  that many mice
[4863.40 --> 4864.02]  with internal
[4864.02 --> 4864.50]  batteries
[4864.50 --> 4865.54]  that
[4865.54 --> 4867.48]  with internal
[4867.48 --> 4867.94]  batteries
[4867.94 --> 4868.84]  so you can't
[4868.84 --> 4869.38]  just swap the
[4869.38 --> 4869.92]  battery pack
[4869.92 --> 4871.38]  have charging
[4871.38 --> 4872.50]  connector positions
[4872.50 --> 4873.98]  such that you can
[4873.98 --> 4874.42]  plug them in
[4874.42 --> 4874.92]  and use them
[4874.92 --> 4875.58]  plugged into the
[4875.58 --> 4875.86]  computer.
[4876.06 --> 4876.48]  So it just looks
[4876.48 --> 4877.70]  like a wired mouse
[4877.70 --> 4878.70]  which is like
[4878.70 --> 4879.34]  what everyone
[4879.34 --> 4880.34]  has always done
[4880.34 --> 4880.72]  forever.
[4880.80 --> 4881.68]  With that said
[4881.68 --> 4882.44]  it charges for
[4882.44 --> 4883.24]  9 hours of use
[4883.24 --> 4884.18]  in about 2 minutes.
[4884.36 --> 4885.00]  I think people's
[4885.00 --> 4885.64]  freak out was a
[4885.64 --> 4886.26]  little bit much
[4886.26 --> 4887.10]  and that's exactly
[4887.10 --> 4887.40]  why.
[4887.70 --> 4888.70]  But it's still
[4888.70 --> 4889.52]  really stupid
[4889.52 --> 4890.16]  and it's another
[4890.16 --> 4890.96]  example of Apple
[4890.96 --> 4891.48]  just going
[4891.48 --> 4894.00]  no, well design
[4894.00 --> 4895.06]  is everything
[4895.06 --> 4897.10]  so we're going to
[4897.10 --> 4897.92]  put the important
[4897.92 --> 4898.42]  things on the
[4898.42 --> 4898.70]  bottom.
[4899.76 --> 4900.40]  Maybe next they'll
[4900.40 --> 4900.96]  put the click on
[4900.96 --> 4901.58]  the bottom because
[4901.58 --> 4902.38]  it looks better
[4902.38 --> 4903.52]  without...
[4903.52 --> 4904.58]  Actually they already
[4904.58 --> 4905.16]  kind of did that
[4905.16 --> 4905.86]  when they removed
[4905.86 --> 4907.10]  the separated
[4907.10 --> 4907.84]  plastic buttons
[4907.84 --> 4908.52]  and just had the
[4908.52 --> 4910.00]  click be part of...
[4910.00 --> 4910.60]  There you go.
[4910.60 --> 4914.14]  The Magic Trackpad has
[4914.14 --> 4914.88]  a built-in battery
[4914.88 --> 4915.84]  brings force touch
[4915.84 --> 4916.36]  to the desktop
[4916.36 --> 4917.92]  which is very cool.
[4918.34 --> 4919.36]  It's 30% larger
[4919.36 --> 4920.14]  almost than the
[4920.14 --> 4921.02]  previous trackpad
[4921.02 --> 4921.76]  and pairs automatically
[4921.76 --> 4922.44]  with your Mac.
[4922.80 --> 4923.88]  And the Magic Keyboard
[4923.88 --> 4925.04]  is rechargeable battery
[4925.04 --> 4926.00]  again via lightning
[4926.00 --> 4926.54]  to USB,
[4926.76 --> 4927.40]  pairs automatically
[4927.40 --> 4929.28]  and better scissor
[4929.28 --> 4929.98]  mechanism under each
[4929.98 --> 4930.38]  key, increased
[4930.38 --> 4930.94]  stability, etc.
[4930.94 --> 4931.20]  etc.
[4931.62 --> 4932.80]  So there you go.
[4932.86 --> 4933.34]  Some updates.
[4933.52 --> 4933.92]  Some of which are
[4933.92 --> 4934.58]  dumb, some of which
[4934.58 --> 4936.20]  are good and some
[4936.20 --> 4936.72]  of which are just
[4936.72 --> 4937.28]  really not very
[4937.28 --> 4938.30]  important at all.
[4938.90 --> 4939.74]  What else we got
[4939.74 --> 4940.04]  here?
[4941.06 --> 4941.96]  I think that might
[4941.96 --> 4942.50]  be about it.
[4943.26 --> 4944.22]  The iPhone 6S
[4944.22 --> 4944.98]  camera shows
[4944.98 --> 4947.18]  literally no or
[4947.18 --> 4947.96]  little improvement
[4947.96 --> 4949.56]  over the iPhone 6.
[4952.86 --> 4954.60]  So yeah, it's fine
[4954.60 --> 4956.72]  but so is the G4.
[4956.84 --> 4957.38]  This is from
[4957.38 --> 4958.48]  dxomark.com.
[4958.86 --> 4959.92]  So is the LG G4.
[4959.92 --> 4961.10]  So is the Samsung Galaxy
[4961.10 --> 4961.58]  S6.
[4961.66 --> 4962.12]  There's a lot of
[4962.12 --> 4962.78]  great smartphone
[4962.78 --> 4963.42]  cameras out there.
[4963.50 --> 4964.16]  It's really nice that
[4964.16 --> 4964.96]  you don't have to buy
[4964.96 --> 4965.76]  an iPhone anymore
[4965.76 --> 4967.38]  and that cell phone
[4967.38 --> 4968.10]  cameras have kind of
[4968.10 --> 4968.70]  gotten as good as
[4968.70 --> 4969.44]  they need to be for a
[4969.44 --> 4969.58]  bit.
[4969.78 --> 4970.58]  Even Apple agrees.
[4970.86 --> 4971.36]  They didn't make it
[4971.36 --> 4971.56]  better.
[4971.98 --> 4972.66]  With that said,
[4972.72 --> 4973.72]  the 6S improves in
[4973.72 --> 4974.66]  a lot of other ways
[4974.66 --> 4975.16]  over the 6.
[4975.20 --> 4976.32]  My review of that is
[4976.32 --> 4977.10]  up on Vessel and
[4977.10 --> 4977.70]  will be coming to
[4977.70 --> 4979.26]  YouTube soon.
[4979.92 --> 4980.34]  Let me talk about
[4980.34 --> 4980.88]  Humble Bundle.
[4981.36 --> 4982.06]  They used to be,
[4982.24 --> 4982.98]  the reason why I
[4982.98 --> 4984.38]  brought that up is
[4984.38 --> 4985.54]  because we used to
[4985.54 --> 4986.68]  call out what the
[4986.68 --> 4987.56]  Humble Bundle was
[4987.56 --> 4988.22]  every week.
[4989.26 --> 4989.56]  Do you remember
[4989.56 --> 4989.80]  that?
[4989.92 --> 4990.20]  Yeah.
[4990.38 --> 4991.88]  Back when it was
[4991.88 --> 4992.82]  cool and sexy.
[4993.04 --> 4994.36]  And that is the
[4994.36 --> 4995.22]  whole point of this
[4995.22 --> 4996.12]  topic is that
[4996.12 --> 4996.88]  Humble Bundle has
[4996.88 --> 4997.86]  let go of 20% of
[4997.86 --> 4998.34]  their staff.
[4998.46 --> 4998.88]  This is off
[4998.88 --> 4999.88]  Destructoid.com.
[5000.00 --> 5000.98]  Which is 12
[5000.98 --> 5001.36]  people.
[5001.92 --> 5003.30]  The CEO admits
[5003.30 --> 5005.02]  that it was a
[5005.02 --> 5005.60]  little bit of an
[5005.60 --> 5006.60]  overly eager
[5006.60 --> 5007.64]  expansion, which is
[5007.64 --> 5008.42]  probably completely
[5008.42 --> 5008.80]  true.
[5009.72 --> 5010.82]  And this is largely
[5010.82 --> 5011.72]  to do, this part
[5011.72 --> 5012.26]  isn't in the notes,
[5012.32 --> 5012.92]  but this is largely
[5012.92 --> 5014.18]  to do with, well,
[5014.50 --> 5015.32]  back in the day we
[5015.32 --> 5016.10]  used to call out
[5016.10 --> 5016.70]  every one of their
[5016.70 --> 5017.44]  bundles because they
[5017.44 --> 5018.02]  were sick.
[5018.02 --> 5019.66]  And they're really
[5019.66 --> 5020.80]  not that sick anymore.
[5020.92 --> 5021.84]  At the very beginning,
[5022.42 --> 5023.20]  which you would expect
[5023.20 --> 5024.16]  a company to grow,
[5024.28 --> 5024.94]  at the very beginning
[5024.94 --> 5026.48]  they were selling a lot
[5026.48 --> 5027.52]  of Humble Bundles.
[5027.60 --> 5028.12]  I think it was like
[5028.12 --> 5029.40]  500,000, 600,000 for
[5029.40 --> 5029.92]  the first sale.
[5030.30 --> 5030.86]  Now they're at like
[5030.86 --> 5032.34]  100,000 to 200,000 for
[5032.34 --> 5033.60]  sale, which is a huge
[5033.60 --> 5034.04]  difference.
[5034.30 --> 5035.12]  And your company is as
[5035.12 --> 5036.46]  big as he made it for,
[5036.46 --> 5040.94]  I don't actually know.
[5041.00 --> 5041.66]  I'm not in the company
[5041.66 --> 5043.24]  from as far as I can
[5043.24 --> 5043.96]  tell the small amount
[5043.96 --> 5044.48]  of things that they
[5044.48 --> 5044.70]  do.
[5045.46 --> 5046.06]  Yeah, well, they do
[5046.06 --> 5046.84]  book bundles.
[5047.04 --> 5048.40]  They do Game Store.
[5048.58 --> 5049.28]  They have a Game Store
[5049.28 --> 5050.16]  and now a subscription
[5050.16 --> 5050.70]  service.
[5052.50 --> 5053.44]  And I mean, it's not
[5053.44 --> 5054.74]  like their competitors
[5054.74 --> 5055.44]  have stood still.
[5055.56 --> 5056.00]  It's not like people,
[5056.16 --> 5056.86]  it's like...
[5056.86 --> 5057.72]  That's the whole thing,
[5057.80 --> 5057.96]  yeah.
[5058.02 --> 5059.10]  There's a lot of
[5059.10 --> 5060.08]  bundle companies now.
[5060.10 --> 5060.54]  That's like Groupon.
[5060.60 --> 5061.44]  Remember when Groupon
[5061.44 --> 5062.68]  went like super amazing?
[5062.82 --> 5063.60]  Everyone thinks it's
[5063.60 --> 5064.40]  important and then
[5064.40 --> 5066.82]  there's like a billion
[5066.82 --> 5068.68]  like clone, you know,
[5068.84 --> 5070.40]  group deal, you know,
[5070.46 --> 5071.82]  go to a restaurant for
[5071.82 --> 5072.92]  less than...
[5072.92 --> 5073.62]  Because they realize
[5073.62 --> 5075.34]  how actually, like,
[5075.44 --> 5076.38]  again, I'm not in the
[5076.38 --> 5077.02]  industry, so I don't
[5077.02 --> 5078.14]  know, but how easy it
[5078.14 --> 5078.82]  probably is.
[5079.04 --> 5079.18]  Yeah.
[5079.24 --> 5079.86]  A lot of these indie
[5079.86 --> 5080.92]  guys are going to want
[5080.92 --> 5081.88]  to be on these bundles.
[5082.02 --> 5082.16]  Yeah.
[5082.22 --> 5082.66]  So if you're like,
[5082.74 --> 5083.48]  hey, bundle, they'll
[5083.48 --> 5084.88]  be like, okay, yes,
[5085.02 --> 5085.38]  please.
[5085.66 --> 5085.88]  Yeah.
[5086.18 --> 5086.68]  I don't know.
[5091.28 --> 5092.24]  There was one other
[5092.24 --> 5092.60]  thing.
[5093.08 --> 5093.48]  I don't know.
[5093.48 --> 5094.22]  Do we want to do more
[5094.22 --> 5095.08]  bad news for AMD?
[5095.76 --> 5096.48]  Or should we just
[5096.48 --> 5097.20]  go easy on them?
[5099.48 --> 5099.84]  Sure.
[5100.66 --> 5101.36]  Corporate fellow
[5101.36 --> 5102.68]  Phil Rogers has left
[5102.68 --> 5104.16]  the company after 21
[5104.16 --> 5105.12]  years.
[5105.26 --> 5105.92]  So our original
[5105.92 --> 5107.82]  article here is from
[5107.82 --> 5108.58]  HardOCP.
[5110.34 --> 5111.44]  So corporate fellow,
[5111.56 --> 5112.26]  to be clear, is the
[5112.26 --> 5113.08]  highest level of
[5113.08 --> 5113.92]  technical recognition
[5113.92 --> 5115.24]  at AMD and is
[5115.24 --> 5116.06]  reserved for those
[5116.06 --> 5117.06]  who impact AMD's
[5117.06 --> 5117.96]  business opportunities
[5117.96 --> 5119.22]  and technical breadth
[5119.22 --> 5120.58]  by providing a high
[5120.58 --> 5121.38]  degree of expertise,
[5121.64 --> 5122.36]  knowledge, creativity,
[5122.36 --> 5123.30]  and tactical and
[5123.30 --> 5124.50]  strategic direction.
[5125.22 --> 5126.52]  He has gone to
[5126.52 --> 5127.66]  NVIDIA and he is
[5127.66 --> 5128.16]  now their chief
[5128.16 --> 5129.44]  software architect
[5129.44 --> 5130.70]  for compute server.
[5132.20 --> 5132.66]  Mwah-mwah.
[5133.56 --> 5134.22]  That's a little
[5134.22 --> 5134.50]  brutal.
[5134.56 --> 5135.10]  Yeah, bummer about
[5135.10 --> 5135.38]  that.
[5136.04 --> 5137.02]  Um, I don't know.
[5137.12 --> 5137.46]  I think that's
[5137.46 --> 5138.00]  probably it.
[5138.52 --> 5139.14]  I think I just
[5139.14 --> 5140.96]  banned like 20 people.
[5141.02 --> 5141.66]  Oh my goodness.
[5141.74 --> 5142.40]  I feel terrible.
[5142.70 --> 5143.52]  I had promised we
[5143.52 --> 5144.20]  were going to do the
[5144.20 --> 5145.62]  after party with the
[5145.62 --> 5146.62]  honorable mentions for
[5146.62 --> 5147.12]  the ultra wide
[5147.12 --> 5147.90]  festival today.
[5147.90 --> 5149.36]  and I am not
[5149.36 --> 5150.36]  because I need to
[5150.36 --> 5151.34]  shoot three fastest
[5151.34 --> 5152.34]  possible right now
[5152.34 --> 5153.38]  and I am already
[5153.38 --> 5155.60]  like tired and it's
[5155.60 --> 5156.56]  already after six
[5156.56 --> 5157.24]  and I have to go
[5157.24 --> 5158.08]  somewhere after this.
[5158.18 --> 5159.46]  So I will do it
[5159.46 --> 5160.38]  but it will not be
[5160.38 --> 5160.78]  this week.
[5160.78 --> 5161.78]  I'm going to edit a
[5161.78 --> 5162.14]  video.
[5162.14 --> 5162.54]  Of your mom?
[5162.74 --> 5162.98]  Yep.
[5163.80 --> 5164.18]  Actually.
[5164.64 --> 5164.78]  Yep.
[5164.96 --> 5165.48]  All right, so see
[5165.48 --> 5166.20]  you guys next week.
[5166.42 --> 5167.22]  Same bat time,
[5167.42 --> 5168.22]  same bat channel.
[5168.68 --> 5169.04]  Bye.
[5169.82 --> 5170.68]  Get banned.
[5172.54 --> 5173.36]  Are they doing that
[5173.36 --> 5173.84]  his thing?
[5174.54 --> 5175.00]  Some of them are
[5175.00 --> 5175.68]  doing his thing.
[5175.86 --> 5176.18]  Some of them are
[5176.18 --> 5177.62]  posting speedpress.net
[5177.62 --> 5179.20]  Like you guys think
[5179.20 --> 5180.78]  about music like
[5180.78 --> 5181.90]  other videos.
[5182.08 --> 5191.40]  Have a good
[5191.46 --> 5192.02]  job.
[5199.40 --> 5199.46]  Thank you.
