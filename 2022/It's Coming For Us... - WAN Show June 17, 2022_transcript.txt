[0.96 --> 7.58]  How are you all doing ladies and gentlemen welcome to the WAN show we got a bunch of great topics for you today in
[9.38 --> 11.38]  Internal news
[11.38 --> 16.52]  There has been some development in the lab to condition drama
[16.52 --> 24.20]  We have actually been contacted by the previous tenants owner and I will be giving you guys an update on that
[24.76 --> 27.88]  Some of it is promising some of it is
[27.88 --> 29.74]  extremely
[29.74 --> 31.56]  disappointing and
[31.56 --> 33.56]  Yes, you I'm looking at you
[34.46 --> 39.60]  We'll also be talking about the supposed actually no let's talk about this instead
[40.34 --> 47.88]  Crypto winter is upon us the crypto market cap has slumped under 1 trillion for the first time since January 2021
[47.88 --> 54.68]  We're gonna be talking about that. What else we got Google engineer reports that AI is sentient and he was suspended for it
[54.68 --> 56.68]  Are they covering something up?
[56.68 --> 63.88]  Are they hiding the takeover or did they just breach their NDA or or did they talk about things?
[63.88 --> 65.88]  They weren't supposed to
[65.88 --> 69.60]  Also, Amazon has an insanely high turnover rate
[69.60 --> 73.90]  The percentages actually made me gasp and I'm not kidding
[73.90 --> 78.20]  Let's talk about that. It's amazing. Well, let's roll that intro first shall we?
[79.10 --> 80.80]  Whoa, what happened here?
[80.80 --> 84.32]  What is going on? Wow your head is huge
[84.32 --> 88.32]  Why you gotta be like that? Why you gotta be like that?
[88.32 --> 91.52]  Cuz you make me carry the couch every week
[91.52 --> 93.52]  I know my egos out of control, okay?
[93.52 --> 96.82]  You don't have to break wait. Oh, whoa, it's running again
[97.52 --> 99.52]  You know what?
[99.52 --> 106.32]  The sponsors are there the show is brought to you by vulture see sonic and x split
[106.32 --> 109.32]  Hey, I hope I mean it could be could not be right
[109.32 --> 113.52]  Yeah, all right update on lab two. Here's the situation. What's going on?
[113.52 --> 119.52]  We posted upset about some of the all the state of some of the things in the building
[120.32 --> 126.16]  I went back and rewatched the video some of the things in the building were apparently our guys very small things
[126.16 --> 129.20]  We did not cut the safety railing like peeling those stickers
[129.20 --> 134.48]  But we never said in the video that that was the previous tenant the things that were the previous tenant were things like
[135.20 --> 142.40]  The replacement of the ceiling tiles the removal of doorknobs cutting that safety railing up where the air compressor was
[142.40 --> 149.44]  I I don't know if I actually mentioned in the video. I forget now that the racking was not secured
[149.44 --> 154.40]  It was not seismically sound. Yeah, I clearly it was not it was not permitted properly
[155.44 --> 156.88]  um
[157.04 --> 163.84]  So we talked about that and some members of our community apparently took it upon themselves to go out of their way to find out
[164.16 --> 171.04]  Who was in that building before us and send them harassing messages not rich guys?
[171.04 --> 174.16]  What the f**k? That's not how you do it?
[175.04 --> 177.92]  No, that's not how you do it at all. You may have noticed
[178.56 --> 186.96]  In the freaking video we blurred the signs we blurred signs that had the previous tenants names on it
[187.44 --> 188.24]  Why?
[188.24 --> 189.20]  Because you guys
[190.24 --> 193.44]  Look, I know most of you are chill and we're fine
[193.44 --> 195.52]  But there's the there's
[196.56 --> 200.32]  Do you think you can be scary sometimes? Okay, do you think you're helping?
[200.88 --> 206.16]  Yeah, you know, you're you're not a white knight at that point. You're like a you're an evil knight
[206.64 --> 210.48]  Like honestly though. It's not it's not helpful. It's not constructive
[210.80 --> 215.68]  I don't know how to condemn this in strong enough language that it never happens again
[216.48 --> 218.48]  Don't get involved
[219.20 --> 220.48]  It's
[220.48 --> 225.36]  It's been bad. There's examples of when it's been bad. Um, yeah, well for sure so do not
[225.84 --> 230.40]  And it's just it's utterly inappropriate like yes, I was I was frustrated
[230.88 --> 234.48]  But like how do I I don't know I don't know how to see the thing is
[234.48 --> 239.60]  I don't know how to address this because it's one of those situations where I don't understand
[240.16 --> 241.60]  What the headspace is?
[242.40 --> 248.40]  Of the people that are seeing that video and going I need to go harass the employees
[249.04 --> 251.92]  Of that previous building 10 individual employees, too
[253.20 --> 256.16]  So what do I what do I tell you do I tell you I don't need protection?
[256.56 --> 260.48]  Do I tell you do I lecture you about how cyber bullying is not okay?
[261.12 --> 263.52]  Do I point out that that employee?
[264.40 --> 270.40]  More than likely had absolutely nothing to do with the decision making process that led to those things happening?
[270.80 --> 272.96]  What do do I do I?
[274.08 --> 276.88]  How do I how do I tell you that you should never do that?
[278.72 --> 283.20]  Other than that what I just did there is that strong enough is that strong enough words?
[283.20 --> 285.20]  Are we never going to have this problem again?
[285.76 --> 288.88]  I I sincerely hope so so i'm really frustrated
[289.84 --> 294.72]  The good news is that we did hear from the previous tenant slash owner
[295.28 --> 298.64]  It seems like they would really like to make things right
[299.44 --> 305.28]  In which case i'm you know, i'm i'm happy to i'll be happy to say that yes, everything is resolved
[305.84 --> 311.44]  I I don't I don't know that that is how it will turn out, but I I really I hope so
[311.44 --> 315.84]  Um, some things do seem to be kind of a miscommunication
[316.64 --> 320.48]  The agreement said that the stained ceiling tiles would be replaced
[322.00 --> 326.08]  There is a box of ceiling tiles on a mezzanine somewhere apparently
[326.56 --> 329.52]  I haven't seen them technically that is replaced
[329.92 --> 336.40]  I pointed out that if I were selling a car and I noted that there were scratches on the bumper and it would be replaced
[336.40 --> 342.88]  I would think the buyer might expect to find that new bumper installed on the car as opposed to in the trunk
[343.28 --> 344.48]  um, but I do
[345.60 --> 346.56]  See it both ways
[347.76 --> 354.64]  So we'll see I mean I yeah, I mean I don't really to be completely honest because like you can you can take that bumper analogy so much further
[355.20 --> 358.16]  The the doors are all dented the doors will be replaced
[358.88 --> 362.80]  And then there's just like doors like strapped to the top of the car like that doesn't count
[363.68 --> 366.48]  I don't know. They should be replaced. It's a different thing
[366.48 --> 374.72]  I mean as I said when we originally talked about this on the wan show the state of lower mainland real estate is such that you basically have
[375.28 --> 380.96]  Not much in the way of recourse as a buyer. Yeah, you either take it or you get
[381.84 --> 391.20]  Nothing, um, I saw this. I saw this hilarious post on reddit where someone uh, someone posted a a letter that they received
[391.20 --> 396.48]  From an investment company that wanted to buy their asset
[397.20 --> 397.60]  and
[397.60 --> 401.20]  They basically posted like a public reply to it saying
[402.08 --> 407.76]  This is not an asset. This is my home. Yeah, and also I was pretty fuck you you
[408.72 --> 410.16]  vampiric
[410.16 --> 411.52]  horrible
[411.52 --> 417.36]  People who are buying up all the homes as assets so that people don't have them. Yeah, um, and I was like
[417.36 --> 422.72]  brah bravo no, this is my home and I intend to live in it like yeah, good job
[426.40 --> 430.56]  And that's the situation I mean, it's it's honestly no different in commercial so
[431.28 --> 435.68]  So much of the commercial real estate here is just getting snapped up by investors
[436.40 --> 437.12]  um, and
[438.32 --> 443.20]  There's there's just nothing you can there's nothing you can do about it as a homo as excuse me as a homeowner as
[443.20 --> 451.04]  As a business owner as an owner occupier is the is the term that we would use so the units that we have here were purchased for
[451.68 --> 453.68]  uh
[453.68 --> 454.24]  three hundred
[454.24 --> 455.12]  Thirty three
[455.12 --> 460.32]  Thousand dollars each and that was for two thousand square feet and when I say two thousand square feet
[460.88 --> 463.84]  I mean two thousand square feet of of plate
[464.16 --> 472.16]  Yeah of actual concrete slab because two thousand square feet of a thousand foot slab and a thousand feet of mezzanine is
[472.72 --> 476.72]  Not the same thing because it doesn't have the same potential to be further built out
[477.20 --> 479.76]  So when you when you run those numbers calculator
[480.40 --> 481.76]  uh, what's that?
[481.76 --> 486.00]  Uh, perfect. Okay, so price per square foot so three hundred and
[486.56 --> 493.76]  Thirty three thousand dollars each divided by there about two thousand square feet each for the units that we bought initially when we
[493.92 --> 496.64]  So that's a hundred and sixty six dollars a square foot
[496.64 --> 505.12]  Lower mainland commercial real estate pricing in the last six to seven years since we moved in here
[505.60 --> 509.20]  Has gone to over seven hundred dollars a square foot
[509.84 --> 516.48]  We paid about seven hundred dollars a square foot down the street that is a quadrupling
[517.52 --> 520.48]  Of pricing more than quadrupling of pricing
[521.04 --> 524.24]  It's absolutely nuts like we couldn't have afforded
[524.88 --> 530.80]  At the stage we were at then to move into a space like this now it would have it would have stunted our growth
[532.64 --> 535.28]  Honestly at this point i'd love to move out of vancouver
[536.00 --> 541.76]  But we have like I tried I know you you pushed for it you pushed for it luke
[541.76 --> 544.48]  That's all that's all I want to hear
[545.44 --> 547.44]  I don't need to dig it in I just
[547.60 --> 555.36]  I actually tried so hard you weren't wrong, but I also think that this was this was all right. We did okay. Yeah
[556.96 --> 564.24]  So the update on lab two is that we are hoping to reach a peaceful resolution peaceful peaceable whatever whatever
[564.24 --> 570.80]  A happy resolution to that whole shenanigans. It seems like they have at least started the conversation to
[571.36 --> 574.48]  Try and get these things resolved in good faith. I'm really happy to hear that
[574.48 --> 577.44]  Has there been any conversation about how they're going to fix the safety rails?
[577.44 --> 579.44]  But I want to point out
[579.44 --> 585.20]  That it was nothing to do with people brigading and harassing people. That is not why they reached out
[585.36 --> 591.68]  All that did was make this process more difficult and more stressful for everyone. You have not helped anything
[591.68 --> 597.04]  Yeah, as for the safety railings, I mean we're honestly at this point
[597.04 --> 602.48]  We're just doing everything through our realtor. We'll let our realtor talk to your realtor because you know clearly it's
[603.44 --> 606.32]  Easier to just let that happen. Yeah, sure. I'm not sure. Yeah
[606.96 --> 608.56]  What do you want to talk about next?
[608.56 --> 614.24]  Uh, should we talk about the google thing the amazon thing is like more fun? Yeah, let's talk about the amazon thing
[615.44 --> 620.08]  So funny amazon's turnover is so high that they're running out of people to hire
[620.08 --> 624.64]  They're running out of people to hire they're expending entire communities. How does that even work?
[625.28 --> 628.08]  How do you actually churn through employees?
[628.80 --> 636.64]  So fast that literally an entire community of people is either already gainfully employed
[637.36 --> 643.44]  Works at amazon or previously worked at amazon and is now gone for some reason or another
[644.56 --> 647.92]  Oh, man, the turnover rates are are insane. We'll get to that in a moment though
[647.92 --> 652.96]  There's a there was a leaked memo from amazon that claims they could run out of people to hire in their u.s
[652.96 --> 656.96]  Warehouses by 2024 and what I mean by that is all of them
[657.60 --> 664.16]  Internal models expected that the phoenix arizona warehouses would run out by 2021 and the warehouses
[664.88 --> 666.88]  In inland empire
[667.12 --> 671.04]  60 miles from la that would run out by end of year 2022
[672.00 --> 677.44]  Amazing the turnover rate is so high. It's tracked internally on a weekly basis weekly
[678.08 --> 681.28]  Three percent weekly or this is the one that
[681.92 --> 687.36]  Really got me three percent weekly like that doesn't sink as hard wild that is insane
[687.76 --> 689.36]  That's like if we had one person
[690.32 --> 692.88]  Going in and out the door every week
[693.44 --> 696.40]  But what about a hundred and fifty percent a year?
[696.40 --> 699.52]  Wait, that would be no wait hold on hold on hold on let me think for a second. We have
[700.08 --> 701.60]  80 people
[701.60 --> 705.12]  So if we holy crap, that'd be like us losing two and a half people a week
[708.80 --> 714.80]  And then you have to hire new ones 150 a year so you're going through your entire team and a half
[716.56 --> 717.60]  Every year
[720.80 --> 722.80]  Whoa
[722.80 --> 724.80]  Like that's crazy
[725.04 --> 725.36]  Wow
[725.36 --> 729.44]  Um, there's some discussion questions when amazon runs out of employees
[730.00 --> 732.56]  That want to work in the area. Will they start shipping them?
[732.96 --> 737.20]  Uh in from other areas or will they start housing workers as well?
[737.20 --> 739.36]  I could absolutely see that
[739.36 --> 739.92]  Yeah, why not?
[739.92 --> 743.92]  Just I mean just start up amazon immigration services smile
[744.40 --> 748.64]  You know amazon smile immigration services or or whatever prime prime immigration
[748.64 --> 752.80]  Just put them in uh farms and call them dorms that'll be good
[753.28 --> 758.56]  Yeah, I mean sell them amazon food pay them in amazon bucks america's done this before right?
[758.56 --> 760.56]  Yeah, yeah, I think it was a long time ago
[760.56 --> 763.92]  Yeah, back in back in the early colonial times spin it back up
[764.88 --> 770.08]  Let her rip amazon out of context for those of you who don't pick up on verbal irony very well
[770.32 --> 773.36]  We are not seriously suggesting that that's horrible. Yes
[773.36 --> 781.12]  The it's it's satire. Okay, we are we are we are saying that because it should be so awful and unthinkable
[781.12 --> 781.44]  Yeah
[781.44 --> 786.00]  That nobody should take it seriously. I'm just spelling that out for you
[786.72 --> 791.52]  Little little reminder along with that to not harass employees of companies that we have trouble with
[793.20 --> 794.40]  Yeah, uh, it's
[795.12 --> 796.00]  That's nuts. I
[796.72 --> 801.36]  There really isn't a ton else on the topic and I don't really know what else to say. It's just actually crazy
[801.36 --> 806.64]  I mean the only real solution to this this is this is this capitalism self-correcting
[807.20 --> 815.20]  Finally, is this it doing what it's supposed to do? I wonder amazon runs out of people to hire and has to raise their wages
[816.00 --> 818.00]  I wonder if to a certain degree
[818.16 --> 819.52]  there
[819.52 --> 823.68]  Because like it doesn't sound like there's a solution being proposed
[824.96 --> 827.76]  Internally, I'm wondering if they're trying to just like
[827.76 --> 829.76]  Like see if they can
[830.24 --> 833.04]  Burn out until a point where they'll have robot replacements
[835.52 --> 836.72]  There's a lot of stuff
[836.72 --> 840.08]  It's a race against time. It's really hard to replace people for yeah
[840.24 --> 844.56]  You can replace a lot of roles though. There are a lot of roles that you can replace
[844.56 --> 847.92]  But there's certain things that are tough and you kind of need supervision from people
[847.92 --> 855.20]  Yeah, or not. I mean not even just supervision from people you just need the the flexibility and the dexterity of people
[855.20 --> 857.12]  It's just not there yet and you think about
[857.68 --> 863.20]  Okay, if all I had to do right if all I had to do was manage like
[863.76 --> 868.16]  Similar sized boxes. I could probably have a robot doing that today
[869.44 --> 871.52]  But it's amazon they sell
[872.16 --> 874.08]  Frickin all over the everything
[874.08 --> 879.20]  Yeah, you know some items are shaped like this and some items are shaped like this lttstore.com
[879.36 --> 883.12]  Some items are shaped like this and if you handle them wrong, they'll break
[884.24 --> 887.84]  You have to have that human awareness
[888.88 --> 893.52]  For for now. Yeah, or you're gonna lose more efficiency. Yeah, this is another really funny thing
[893.52 --> 894.16]  I saw on reddit
[894.16 --> 900.56]  There's this robot that apparently exists only to find spills and then make noise so that a human will come clean it up
[900.56 --> 906.16]  And uh, there's this amazing clip of it like knocking something over itself
[907.28 --> 909.68]  Dragging it around while the people who are going like
[909.68 --> 910.72]  Uh-oh
[910.72 --> 911.68]  Uh-oh, uh-oh
[913.44 --> 919.84]  There's a point where robots just create extra work for people as opposed to actually saving them any work. That's awesome. Yeah, yeah
[920.88 --> 925.36]  Does that three percent turnover rate include their aws side? No, I believe this is just warehouses
[925.36 --> 930.08]  Um, I have heard very anecdotally based on basically nothing
[930.48 --> 937.12]  Um, that their software development side has a lot of turnover as well, uh, because i've heard it's like hyper competitive
[937.52 --> 937.92]  um
[939.36 --> 946.88]  And that makes sense very tough. Um, but it's it's a different form of turnover that the warehouses would have
[946.88 --> 949.52]  Because it would be it would be hyper competitive. So it would be like
[951.20 --> 955.20]  Burnout due to effort. Yeah, I could see that being very challenging. I mean, we already
[955.84 --> 962.24]  We we already kind of see the effects of that. I mean the number of people that come in and interview with you
[962.96 --> 964.96]  And say, you know
[965.20 --> 966.48]  hey
[966.48 --> 968.80]  I'm i'm looking to kind of like
[969.84 --> 978.08]  Not deal with this crazy breakneck pace of of working and 80 to 100 hour work these crazy number of hours
[978.08 --> 980.08]  I mean
[980.08 --> 985.52]  The really funny parts of those conversations are where when they also say because we actually do work
[985.76 --> 988.96]  Like just normal work hours at our companies
[989.36 --> 992.64]  Um, so the funny part is when they say oh by the way
[992.96 --> 996.32]  This is what I was making out of fang and I want you to match it more like
[997.20 --> 1000.32]  You want to work less than half as many hours and get the same pay
[1000.32 --> 1004.96]  It's like that. Well, you let us know how that works out and wherever it is that you're gonna go try and pitch that
[1004.96 --> 1009.28]  You might find somewhere with some some hella vc money that might make that work
[1009.28 --> 1010.64]  But yeah, we're not it
[1010.64 --> 1015.52]  I'm saying it chief like I mean, yeah, we we don't we don't claim to be everything to everyone
[1015.52 --> 1022.32]  But what we do try to do is achieve reasonable reasonable life balance and you know what it totally
[1022.88 --> 1027.68]  Makes sense like I I could see myself telling my kids like hey, yeah get some
[1028.32 --> 1031.76]  Get some coding education get a couple projects under your belt
[1032.80 --> 1039.60]  Go just you know trial by fire be be forged as a developer at at a fang like company
[1040.16 --> 1044.88]  And get out after a few years with basically your down payment taken care of and like
[1045.28 --> 1047.36]  A super sick resume that you can take to
[1048.24 --> 1052.72]  Basically, whatever thing you decide you want to work on after that. Yeah, well, it's not a bad path find something that you
[1053.20 --> 1057.92]  Actually want to work on I've also heard that the projects can be extremely soul-sucking
[1058.16 --> 1063.68]  I mean if I was at google working on one of their 18 chat applications, how
[1064.56 --> 1066.56]  Demoralizing would that be?
[1066.56 --> 1070.24]  Yeah, well, this is all just gonna get thrown in the garbage in a couple years
[1071.20 --> 1073.44]  Yeah, I mean, I think the mobile time to go get drunk guys
[1074.88 --> 1076.16]  How do you well?
[1076.16 --> 1078.00]  How do you even keep working on it?
[1078.40 --> 1083.52]  Something i've thought about for the for a long time and i've talked to you about some of the like mobile games development stories
[1083.92 --> 1086.88]  Uh that I have from like friends that work in that industry
[1087.44 --> 1088.32]  um
[1088.40 --> 1090.80]  But something I I find it very interesting that people
[1091.60 --> 1095.68]  In like say our generation grew up playing the games that we grew up playing
[1096.48 --> 1101.60]  And decided that because of those games they wanted to become developers so they could make more games
[1101.60 --> 1105.84]  Right, um, and then they ended up in the mobile games development industry
[1106.56 --> 1112.96]  And every single one of them that i've talked to that's in that industry isn't in that industry because they're making games that they like
[1113.20 --> 1114.72]  It's golden handcuffs
[1114.72 --> 1119.84]  They're making so much money that it's a really difficult internal logical argument
[1120.48 --> 1126.32]  To say like I should go work on something else because you're like well i'm gonna lose like half of my income
[1126.64 --> 1130.16]  Because I make incredible money from this like soul-sucking
[1130.96 --> 1132.32]  parasitic industry
[1133.20 --> 1136.24]  That I guess i'll just stay here but it's like I don't know man
[1136.80 --> 1143.20]  It doesn't seem worth it to me, but it is worth it some people and and some people have relatively big families and there's like or or
[1143.20 --> 1148.32]  Relatively big whatever type of financial commitments and for sure they just have to do what they got to do
[1148.32 --> 1153.92]  And the thing about financial commitments is as your means grow you find ways to make more of them
[1154.32 --> 1160.00]  Like my financial commitments are such that if I don't make millions of dollars a year
[1160.56 --> 1162.56]  I will be ruined
[1163.12 --> 1165.12]  Like I I actually just have
[1165.84 --> 1172.08]  Mortgages that cost half a million dollars a year like just right that into the mortgage
[1173.20 --> 1178.64]  I I like internet internet bills that are on the tens of thousands of dollars a year
[1179.28 --> 1183.12]  Like it's it's and to be clear i'm talking i'm talking commercially
[1184.64 --> 1190.72]  Not personally. I was gonna i was gonna prompt that in a second but yeah, no, no, no my home internet is like a hundred bucks a month
[1190.72 --> 1193.28]  That's yeah, um
[1195.20 --> 1198.96]  And so I can I can see how it's really easy to fall into that trap where you go
[1198.96 --> 1204.56]  Okay, if i'm making less than 250 000 a year as a mobile game developer or whatever
[1205.52 --> 1208.96]  I can't survive because i've gone and i've i've
[1209.92 --> 1217.04]  I've adopted a lifestyle that necessitates that kind of of income and that can look like a lot of different things
[1217.04 --> 1221.92]  It can look like you know houses cars sugar babies. I don't know what what costs money
[1226.64 --> 1230.00]  Oh geez uh medical bills in certain countries like what does a sugar baby?
[1230.00 --> 1232.40]  Um, I don't know asking for a friend
[1234.80 --> 1240.80]  Uh, and like it just in case there's anyone in mobile game development industry that's watching that is feeling highly offended
[1241.12 --> 1241.92]  um
[1241.92 --> 1246.80]  I'm not judging these are just stories from people that I know that are in that industry that feel that way
[1246.80 --> 1251.04]  No, and there's mobile games that are that are not gonna be soul sucking there 100%
[1251.04 --> 1254.08]  They're like, I mean, uh, what what was that one that man?
[1254.08 --> 1258.40]  What was that one that I really want to play when it once it's finally not apple arcade exclusive?
[1258.40 --> 1259.60]  It was the final fantasy
[1259.60 --> 1261.36]  Yeah, and i'm not gonna remember the name of it
[1261.36 --> 1266.32]  I know you're talking about can't remember but it looks absolutely amazing and I can't wait to play it once
[1266.56 --> 1271.36]  It's on a platform where I know i'm gonna be able to put my save game somewhere that I will actually still
[1271.84 --> 1273.84]  Have it at some point. Yeah
[1274.32 --> 1277.20]  Let's see. What are people talking about diablo immortal? No, that's not the one
[1277.20 --> 1279.68]  Oh, that's that's not it
[1281.44 --> 1284.88]  I don't think my thing's catching on I knew it wouldn't but which thing
[1285.44 --> 1290.88]  Getting people to say if they're making like a stupid purchase getting people to say i'm gonna diablo immortal it or i'm gonna di it
[1290.88 --> 1294.24]  No, that's not gonna catch on be so great. Fantasian. That's the one. Thank you
[1294.24 --> 1298.40]  I do enjoy people that have done the the play on words of calling it diablo immoral
[1300.56 --> 1302.32]  It's pretty good. I mean
[1302.32 --> 1305.52]  Oh, ah, okay, if you know
[1306.32 --> 1309.60]  That you are preying on people's addictive personalities
[1310.64 --> 1315.20]  There's an argument to be made for immoral in that particular one
[1316.64 --> 1322.40]  What's not immoral is telling you about our sponsors. I got to get this out of the way quick today because i've got a the writing team
[1322.80 --> 1327.76]  Speaking of things we try to do to make working here, you know about more than just money
[1328.48 --> 1333.76]  We're all getting together. We're hanging out tonight, and we're gonna play some take links house party. Oh, that's cool
[1333.76 --> 1338.32]  It is so freaking fun. Also. I joined the discord and I got in touch with the dev
[1339.44 --> 1346.00]  I was wrong. I was wrong. There is still active development. Oh, it's just that it's just one guy
[1346.72 --> 1350.88]  That makes sense. So he's got a content pack coming sometime in the next few weeks
[1350.88 --> 1356.08]  That's like three more levels and I was like sweet dude. I don't want to tell you how to run your jam over there
[1356.08 --> 1358.08]  But like just release one at a time
[1360.96 --> 1368.48]  It's a lot better to release one at a time once every nine months then have literally nothing in your dev blog for like three years
[1368.72 --> 1372.40]  And then drop a huge content update. Yeah, come on
[1373.20 --> 1378.56]  That is cool though. That like if you haven't tried it yet take links house party is legitimately probably one of the most fun
[1379.12 --> 1381.36]  uh, like in-person vr party games
[1382.24 --> 1385.68]  Ever I can't think of one that I played that's more fun. It's just
[1386.80 --> 1393.04]  Just stupid chaos and and because it's stupid chaos. It's good for like everybody. Yeah, you don't have to be good at it
[1393.04 --> 1398.00]  It just doesn't matter. Yeah, it's just funny hilarious. My kids absolutely love it
[1398.00 --> 1400.40]  Yeah, very cool. You only need one headset as well
[1400.40 --> 1404.08]  Just in case you're wondering one headset and like a tv or a large monitor or something
[1404.08 --> 1409.84]  Yeah, you can have up to eight couch players causing chaos for the headset player. Yeah, uh, the show is brought to you by vulture

[1476.08 --> 1476.96]  Okay
[1476.96 --> 1482.16]  Taking off my sponsored hat for a second and putting on my just tech tips hat
[1482.16 --> 1489.44]  Okay, so i'm not saying buy a see sonic power supply for this and i'm not saying that my crystal ball is perfect
[1490.24 --> 1497.92]  But if the rumors about the next gen power the next gen graphics cards consuming as much power as they are rumored to consume
[1498.16 --> 1501.36]  Turn out to be true. I would say that today
[1502.08 --> 1504.08]  Is the day to get a power supply
[1504.96 --> 1508.00]  It might not be crypto boom time or anything like that
[1508.56 --> 1515.12]  But I would say that before everyone in their dog figures out they need a power supply upgrade might be a great time to
[1515.60 --> 1520.48]  Put my sponsored hat back on pick up a tx 1000 power supply from see sonic

[1574.08 --> 1576.08]  Should we talk about the google ai thing?
[1576.08 --> 1583.44]  I want to talk about crypto winter is upon us. Let's do it. I have spent an embarrassing amount of time doom scrolling
[1583.92 --> 1588.88]  uh crypto crap like hashtag crypto crash means and to be clear to be clear
[1589.52 --> 1594.24]  I am not uh, I i'm not enjoying other people losing money
[1594.72 --> 1599.60]  uh, i've i've lost money on investments including crypto in the past to be clear
[1599.60 --> 1605.52]  I hold I hold nothing today except some my meme stocks and um
[1605.52 --> 1611.92]  um, not even all of those I think yvonne sold them or something. I don't know the point is I i'm out I think
[1612.72 --> 1615.60]  I have no idea what for how what for um
[1617.04 --> 1619.20]  So I but not all of them. I I don't know
[1619.68 --> 1623.60]  Basically, I don't have the investment account anymore. I was gonna say it doesn't really manage long story
[1623.60 --> 1631.92]  Um, but framework so I have my framework investment and then I have whatever crypto I have from mining on the land center gpus
[1632.48 --> 1637.12]  And then I think we were running the editing machines after hours for a while, but then the editors complained
[1637.68 --> 1640.80]  Uh, because like nice hash caused like
[1641.44 --> 1644.80]  Kind of weirdness on their systems or something. So I don't think it's on there anymore. I don't know
[1645.04 --> 1649.12]  I don't anyway, so I'm just I'm trying to disclose everything. I'm trying to be extremely thorough
[1649.12 --> 1656.16]  Um, so i've i've experienced it. I have lost money. I'm not i'm not saying that's a good feeling or that I would wish it on anyone
[1656.56 --> 1658.72]  But they're just so funny
[1659.12 --> 1662.24]  I saw this one where someone had like green and red peppers
[1662.88 --> 1666.24]  And laid them out on their on their countertop
[1666.72 --> 1670.24]  Like to show the like the loss the gains and losses chart
[1670.96 --> 1673.28]  And like mirrored the real one for bitcoin
[1674.56 --> 1675.68]  That's hilarious
[1675.68 --> 1679.04]  That's so random when you buy the dip and it keeps on dipping
[1679.36 --> 1683.68]  Like just ah, I don't know because that community is so meme-y
[1684.24 --> 1687.04]  Whether crypto is going like this or like this
[1687.68 --> 1692.16]  They're memeing right there's gonna be there's gonna be jokes. There's gonna be memes. Yeah, I just I I love it. I love it
[1694.00 --> 1699.92]  Oh, I guess we should talk about it bitcoin has fallen to roughly 20k usd not seen since december 2020
[1700.08 --> 1704.56]  ethereum has fallen to roughly 1k usd not seen since january 2021
[1704.56 --> 1709.92]  1 slash december 2020 and the global crypto market cap is currently at
[1710.56 --> 1719.12]  893 billion at time of writing which means it's probably changed given how rapidly it's been changing over the last little while
[1719.60 --> 1722.32]  Ethereum mining is no longer profitable for many miners
[1722.32 --> 1724.00]  Um
[1724.00 --> 1725.44]  And and to be fair
[1725.44 --> 1727.36]  Whoops whoops whoops this is a there
[1728.24 --> 1729.36]  Big massive
[1729.92 --> 1734.00]  Monumental crash that is causing huge problems and companies to fold and all this other kind of stuff
[1734.16 --> 1738.88]  But people are losing their jobs, which is yes, which is always lots of always not cool
[1739.44 --> 1742.48]  Um to be fair the developers they'll find other jobs. Um
[1742.48 --> 1745.84]  Uh, but it is not the it is
[1746.96 --> 1748.96]  It's true
[1749.68 --> 1756.32]  Wow, you are so you are so bitter right now. He spent the entire week doing interviews this week
[1757.52 --> 1759.36]  Can you tell he's a little mad?
[1762.80 --> 1767.76]  I uh, it's it is true. There's so much demand for developers. I I think that's like
[1767.76 --> 1772.32]  I think that's understated sometimes
[1773.04 --> 1773.36]  Um
[1775.12 --> 1780.16]  But like if if your job sucks if you like hate your job and development just like look for another one
[1780.16 --> 1784.00]  There's probably lots out there like it's actually crazy. I I
[1784.56 --> 1789.76]  It is not uncommon for me to be interviewing someone and they'll be like just let you know for transparency
[1790.32 --> 1795.76]  I'm currently in talks with like five other companies. I have job offers from three. Uh, so just
[1795.76 --> 1800.32]  What's your timeline? Cuz like I'm gonna accept one of these and it's like
[1801.20 --> 1803.20]  Okay, that's that's cool. Like I'm
[1804.00 --> 1807.12]  Why not right like they probably should i'm not gonna hold it against them, but
[1808.32 --> 1814.88]  There are people out there that are hiring lots of developers. Um, so I think they'll I genuinely think they will land on their feet
[1814.88 --> 1820.64]  So i'm not as worried about that like it's i'm not trying to be like negative. I think they will be okay
[1821.20 --> 1824.88]  Dredd over on twitch says as a software dev I agree with luke lol
[1824.88 --> 1828.24]  Yeah, like it's they will actually probably be okay
[1828.56 --> 1833.12]  Um, so it's it's not like that huge of a deal. Uh, so what I was saying before that though
[1833.12 --> 1836.72]  Was like there has been times in the past where ethereum has not been profitable to mine
[1837.04 --> 1841.04]  Um, people just kept mining it there is a quote here, which I think is kind of interesting
[1841.28 --> 1846.16]  Which is at this point you are better off to just buy ethereum rather than run your cards
[1846.56 --> 1850.32]  Um, if you were trying to buy the dip i'm not suggesting that
[1850.32 --> 1855.04]  I'm just saying disclaimer. This is not financial advice. Not at all
[1855.04 --> 1860.80]  We are not either financial advisors or crypto bros. Uh, yeah, no, um, I just think I know
[1862.80 --> 1869.04]  The people in the crypto space that have been in the crypto space for like a really long time have weathered some crazy storms
[1869.04 --> 1871.68]  Oh, yeah, they've seen it worse than this. Yeah, so like
[1871.68 --> 1875.60]  Like the the like real like super og crypto people
[1876.32 --> 1878.32]  You know what it probably kind of sucks right now
[1878.64 --> 1883.44]  Whatever whichever winklevoss twin is like a crypto billionaire or whatever
[1884.32 --> 1887.60]  Gonna be all right. Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be okay. Um
[1888.16 --> 1890.48]  So with that said yes
[1892.00 --> 1893.52]  Are you buying the dip no?
[1893.52 --> 1895.52]  No
[1895.52 --> 1898.64]  No, i'm out i've been out for a while. I got burned on uh
[1899.84 --> 1902.48]  I think i've talked about this story on wan before i'm not sure
[1903.20 --> 1906.40]  So I I was uh, I was in a little bit a long time ago
[1906.96 --> 1910.72]  Um, and I had ordered some hardware wallets and they had come in
[1911.44 --> 1916.00]  But it was like they had come in the same week this event happened and I hadn't had time to like
[1916.48 --> 1922.40]  Migrate things over to them yet. So I had all my crypto in a platform called quadriga cx
[1923.12 --> 1927.12]  And now it's all gone if you want to look into that. It's actually a very interesting story
[1927.44 --> 1929.44]  There's some like
[1929.44 --> 1935.04]  Possibly the owner of it faked his own death and all this crazy stuff, uh, but it's gone
[1935.28 --> 1939.52]  So once that happened, uh, I was like man, I can't believe this happened
[1939.84 --> 1944.16]  And a bunch of people in the crypto space pointed at me and just said I was like an idiot for having an exchange
[1944.16 --> 1946.40]  And I was like, you know what i'm just not gonna do this anymore
[1947.04 --> 1948.24]  I'm done
[1950.24 --> 1952.24]  Have a good one
[1952.40 --> 1957.36]  Yeah, that's it for me and honestly they weren't even like entirely wrong. I should have set up those wallets earlier
[1957.60 --> 1961.84]  I should have migrated things to them earlier. I should not have trusted the platform. Yep, but I just
[1962.56 --> 1964.80]  I mean, we knew the platforms were shady af
[1964.96 --> 1967.76]  Yeah, so like you know what? Yes, okay
[1968.48 --> 1970.48]  I just don't have the time I got other things going on
[1971.12 --> 1977.12]  It's like it's a big time investment to properly be involved with this stuff. Yeah, that's the thing is like on the one hand
[1977.12 --> 1980.56]  It's like passive income bro. You just run your cards, bro
[1981.36 --> 1987.60]  But on the other hand if you want to actually know a bit be dialed into what's going on in that space
[1987.60 --> 1988.96]  It moves fast
[1988.96 --> 1991.28]  And capitalizing on the next big grift
[1991.76 --> 1993.20]  You've got to be
[1993.20 --> 1996.16]  You've got to be right at the beginning of that of that
[1996.72 --> 2000.64]  Parabolic upswing right like you can't if you catch the peak
[2000.64 --> 2004.32]  Well, guess what you were the bigger fool, right? So it's yeah
[2005.92 --> 2008.56]  So it's it's tough. Yeah, it takes a lot. It takes a lot of time
[2008.56 --> 2012.40]  It takes a lot of energy against people who have inside information that you don't have
[2013.04 --> 2016.72]  They're like, what's what's their what's their face like ant miner for example
[2016.72 --> 2020.16]  Apparently they will mine on whatever their new hardware is
[2020.72 --> 2027.76]  For a very long time and then literally release that new miner once their next one is like ready to go
[2028.56 --> 2032.72]  So that they are always way ahead in terms of mining efficiency
[2033.20 --> 2037.92]  And so they're literally just like selling used hardware that they already abused. It's like, oh, okay
[2037.92 --> 2044.80]  Now to be clear, this is all allegedly. I don't know this for sure. Yeah, so blah blah whatever. I've I've heard it from a few
[2045.84 --> 2049.20]  I've heard it from some people who probably know. Yeah, but it's still
[2049.84 --> 2052.48]  Allegedly. Yep. Yep. Still allegedly. Yep
[2052.48 --> 2058.72]  But uh, there's been some good sides for people that aren't uh deeply in crypto
[2059.36 --> 2066.24]  Graphics cards have like really sprung back. Not only are we at msrp, but there's a lot of options that are below smrp
[2067.44 --> 2074.48]  smrp? msrp. Uh, the used market is feeling I wouldn't necessarily say completely vibrant yet, but like
[2074.48 --> 2076.48]  Scrapyard horse?
[2076.64 --> 2080.56]  If we were going to it would not have been a good idea for a long time
[2080.96 --> 2088.64]  And now might actually be a solid idea. Yeah, apparently there's uh 30 80s on ebay as low as 575 bucks
[2089.36 --> 2095.20]  Wow, that's like actually crazy personal anecdote from nicholas ploof who prepared this one
[2095.44 --> 2100.72]  I walked into langley memex on sunday and saw tons of cards apparently they've had stock for about two months
[2101.52 --> 2106.08]  Some a buddy of mine who's building a new computer messaged me being like hey should I get this card?
[2106.08 --> 2107.36]  It's like
[2107.36 --> 2109.36]  discounted and I was like
[2110.64 --> 2111.92]  What?
[2111.92 --> 2115.84]  Like what are you talking about? And I thought it was like oh he's must must be crazy
[2115.84 --> 2120.96]  So I opened the link and I was like they're they're all discounted. That's insane. I'm so happy
[2121.20 --> 2123.76]  I'm happy to have stuff to make videos about again
[2123.76 --> 2127.36]  I'm happy people are gonna actually be able to build computers. This has been stupid
[2127.36 --> 2132.96]  It's it's been nice like kind of you know dropping the race flag for a bunch of friends that have been like
[2132.96 --> 2137.52]  Should I build the computer for the last like few years and be like no no no hold off hold off?
[2137.52 --> 2138.80]  Then i'm like go go go go
[2138.80 --> 2140.16]  Yeah, go it's go time
[2140.64 --> 2143.44]  Man, there's so much great hardware out there right now. Yeah, like
[2143.84 --> 2145.84]  uh, you've got am5 coming
[2146.08 --> 2152.24]  You've got alder lake here now with potential upgrades to rocket lake, which is looking really promising
[2152.24 --> 2158.88]  The cpu space has been cpus have been great for a bit. Yeah, and then on the gpu side you've got well
[2159.20 --> 2163.04]  I don't know how to feel about I don't know how to feel about intel art graphics at this point
[2163.04 --> 2165.20]  apparently they're launching china only which is
[2166.00 --> 2169.36]  Never a good sign that always means that you are
[2170.88 --> 2174.56]  Either a can't produce enough for a global launch or b
[2175.76 --> 2177.20]  Want to just
[2177.20 --> 2181.92]  Focus on a market where you can move all your inventory through oems
[2182.48 --> 2186.40]  Rather than have to actually compete in the open market on its own merit. So we'll
[2187.36 --> 2189.36]  Interesting
[2192.24 --> 2197.68]  That's an interesting idea scrapyard wars but with new hires so like we remote control
[2198.80 --> 2203.12]  We remote control our people because that like put like a bug in their ear
[2203.12 --> 2206.24]  I actually probably wouldn't have a problem anymore, but you're like just screwed
[2206.24 --> 2210.48]  Everyone's gonna know who you are center. I can't go freaking anywhere. Yeah, I went out with ivan
[2210.48 --> 2215.52]  We went like we went to do uh like a glass blowing class got some fast food
[2216.16 --> 2220.64]  And did something else and I literally got recognized at all three of those places
[2221.04 --> 2224.72]  And the funny thing about it is that i i'm not famous
[2225.68 --> 2228.16]  Really, I know the two things I just said sound
[2229.04 --> 2236.00]  Highly contradictory, but you got to understand the difference between being famous if you are if you're taylor swift
[2236.24 --> 2239.68]  No matter where you go you are going to get absolutely mobbed right?
[2240.24 --> 2241.28]  Whereas for me
[2242.24 --> 2248.24]  The issue is that I happen to run into like young dudes in all of those places
[2249.68 --> 2251.28]  So with that demographic
[2251.92 --> 2257.68]  Like very well known yeah, the odds of the like the odds of me getting recognized at like, uh, you know
[2258.16 --> 2260.96]  A badminton also you're in your area
[2261.60 --> 2266.88]  So it's not weird for someone to spot you here. Oh, no, it doesn't really that doesn't really matter
[2266.88 --> 2269.68]  I could be in malaysia for all it matters the demos the demo
[2270.24 --> 2276.08]  It just is what it is. Yeah, uh, whereas if I okay if i'm on a construction site, which i've been living on
[2276.48 --> 2283.52]  For quite a while now, um, if i'm on a construction site the odds of like, uh, like someone who's like a like a pool contractor
[2283.52 --> 2289.84]  Knowing linus tech tips much lower and then if I go and hang out at like, uh, um
[2289.84 --> 2292.48]  A crafting center like a crafting club
[2293.92 --> 2299.60]  Literally zero percent chance I I walk in I am the most anonymous nobody
[2299.60 --> 2303.52]  I might as well have a ge fox mask on I am anonymous
[2303.52 --> 2309.04]  I am no one so it's it's just it's a it's a funny thing I
[2311.28 --> 2313.28]  I don't know
[2315.60 --> 2321.28]  Uh, I think that's pretty much it for this topic there was uh, there's the big layoffs that we did mention
[2321.28 --> 2324.80]  There's more details on that. Yeah, um coinbase laid off
[2325.44 --> 2327.44]  18 of their staff
[2327.92 --> 2330.96]  Which is wait 1100 people I think what?
[2333.52 --> 2335.52]  Coinbase
[2335.76 --> 2337.76]  Had
[2337.76 --> 2341.84]  I'm sorry coinbase had over 6000 employees. What were they doing all day?
[2343.68 --> 2345.68]  They're a huge
[2346.40 --> 2350.00]  Company, what do you mean? Yeah, but like they need 6000 people
[2351.12 --> 2352.24]  um
[2352.40 --> 2357.36]  I guess that's a good point because when I you know when I when I said they didn't when I said my
[2357.44 --> 2362.88]  Thing so there's that uh, well, I think that's mostly because they're they're saying it's because they like grew too quickly and stuff
[2363.12 --> 2367.68]  It's probably mostly because the crypto crash. I don't know. I could be wrong. Um
[2368.88 --> 2374.64]  But when I read that number I um I uh automatically assumed uh developers, but it might not be
[2376.08 --> 2378.08]  Because they're like an exchange, right?
[2378.56 --> 2382.48]  This could be business people accountants stuff like that. This could be all over the board
[2382.48 --> 2389.20]  I guess if you're all over the world you'll need a ton of accounting to man international commerce is a nightmare
[2389.44 --> 2395.76]  And it's probably even a little bit more crazy when you're converting crypto and stuff still 6 000 people
[2397.04 --> 2402.16]  A lot of people that's mind-blowing. Yeah cavalry connect over on float plane says yo linus
[2402.16 --> 2405.76]  I wore your shirts in the oil patch everyone knows who you are. Okay, well
[2405.76 --> 2410.48]  That's a high-tech industry you might not think about it that way
[2411.04 --> 2413.44]  But like gas oil and gas exploration
[2414.08 --> 2416.16]  super high-tech industry so it depends
[2417.20 --> 2421.60]  I might actually expect that as well, but if I were to go, uh,
[2422.16 --> 2425.60]  Okay, at least up here popular popular with the young adults. Yes
[2426.00 --> 2430.96]  Whereas like the every any roofer that i've ever run into is like, oh, yeah, so what do you do?
[2430.96 --> 2435.12]  Like i'm youtube and like, oh, yeah, cool. I like youtube
[2436.64 --> 2439.84]  Like it's just it's different. It's just it's hard to I don't know
[2440.56 --> 2447.20]  Where I encounter it probably most is the parents of like my kids friends really?
[2447.20 --> 2451.84]  Yeah, because interesting there are pretty much two
[2452.48 --> 2460.56]  Like tracks, right? There's people for whom technology and the internet is a huge part of their personal culture
[2461.12 --> 2467.44]  And then there's people like the guy I bought a used clarinet from on facebook marketplace last night
[2468.24 --> 2469.28]  who
[2469.28 --> 2471.28]  Whose entire life is like?
[2471.52 --> 2479.44]  Skateboarding around and like busking on in parks and like hanging out with friends and
[2480.40 --> 2483.84]  It was like yeah, man. Like yeah, cool. I hope you enjoy the clarinet
[2484.72 --> 2489.36]  Yeah, okay, and then some guy walks past in the lobby of the building where he lives and it's like
[2491.28 --> 2496.32]  Like I it's just one of those things where if you're like a real celebrity people will know your name
[2496.80 --> 2503.20]  Regardless of of whether they follow that space or not but internet celebrity is like this. It's like this seat here
[2503.84 --> 2509.68]  Necessarily true to be completely honest. I would not recognize taylor swift. Yeah, but you know who she is. I know her name
[2509.92 --> 2516.24]  Yeah, whereas if you don't if you're not dialed into the technology space, you would not know my name. Yeah fair enough
[2517.04 --> 2519.52]  It's just it's just different. It's just super different
[2519.52 --> 2523.36]  I do think it's different but I don't think the the mark is that everyone would recognize you
[2523.36 --> 2528.48]  You know what I mean? There's a lot of celebrities that I don't really know because I've never cared about that space
[2530.00 --> 2534.40]  There's there's a fair amount of people that I might recognize their face because they're in some like movie that I like
[2534.40 --> 2536.24]  But I have no idea what their name is
[2536.24 --> 2538.24]  I don't know
[2539.92 --> 2541.92]  So the discussion here is
[2542.24 --> 2550.80]  Scalping prices are gone, but will the 40 and 7 000 series continue to drive our expected prices for gpus
[2551.44 --> 2552.40]  up
[2552.56 --> 2556.08]  And I think they will I think that nvidia and amd
[2556.32 --> 2561.44]  I think nvidia in particular is kicking themselves over the introductory pricing of the 3000 series
[2561.92 --> 2563.60]  I think that the crypto
[2564.48 --> 2565.20]  uh
[2565.20 --> 2567.20]  The crypto msrp
[2567.44 --> 2573.04]  Increases were an opportunity for them to write this wrong for their shareholders
[2573.04 --> 2576.56]  And I think that as we see 4000 series introduced
[2576.80 --> 2581.60]  They're going to be willing to take the pain that comes with the jump in
[2582.16 --> 2585.84]  4000 series over 3000 series launch msrps
[2586.24 --> 2587.60]  I think they'll hide behind
[2588.24 --> 2593.52]  Well compared to where 3000 series ended up this is very reasonable and I think yeah
[2593.84 --> 2596.16]  They they will continue to try to drive
[2596.72 --> 2601.44]  Especially at the high end halo halo tier product pricing up
[2602.00 --> 2607.12]  Because the funny thing about it is that i'm gonna blow your mind right now and sound super out of touch
[2607.12 --> 2608.08]  But it's the truth
[2608.96 --> 2612.40]  gpu pricing even at the high end is not that high
[2614.88 --> 2619.04]  A thousand dollars twelve hundred dollars is not that much yeah it is
[2619.60 --> 2620.08]  hold on
[2621.04 --> 2623.28]  Let me let me explain okay
[2623.28 --> 2629.44]  Have you ever gone back and looked at like london drugs or circuit city flyers okay?
[2629.44 --> 2634.08]  Yes, but hold it but i'm not done that is not fair and you know it from the late 90s
[2634.32 --> 2637.04]  okay great okay nice where a complete
[2637.68 --> 2644.32]  setup and we're not even talking something that might be suitable for gaming this might not even have a 3d accelerator in it
[2644.72 --> 2650.40]  Okay, a complete setup is going to cost you three four five six thousand dollars
[2650.40 --> 2652.96]  Yep, now you account for inflation
[2654.00 --> 2657.68]  Then it's like if if a like personal computer
[2658.24 --> 2660.24]  Cost four thousand dollars today
[2660.80 --> 2663.52]  That wouldn't even be that ridiculous now obviously
[2664.00 --> 2668.48]  We had a period in between where we enjoyed extremely low prices
[2669.20 --> 2673.84]  Where top tier gpus were 500 bucks and the rest of the system it went in could be had for
[2674.24 --> 2678.16]  500 bucks and that was a pretty that was a pretty good time the sub
[2678.16 --> 2685.36]  One thousand dollar like high-end gaming pc was a cool man the early 2000s was a wild ride wasn't it?
[2685.60 --> 2692.24]  Yeah, like like mid 2000s. I guess the mid 2000s was when we really peaked before ati
[2692.24 --> 2693.92]  amd and nvidia figured out
[2695.12 --> 2697.68]  We can charge a thousand dollars for just this like
[2698.40 --> 2700.32]  Gaming thing yeah, yeah
[2700.32 --> 2704.40]  But in the if we look at the entire timeline
[2705.68 --> 2711.84]  That's not how anything works. I don't know why you're making this argument. That's how lots of things work. No, it's not avocados work
[2712.08 --> 2715.28]  Yeah, but avocados are not cheap use and you know that
[2716.96 --> 2721.04]  Cost of technology goes down over time. That's just how it works unless it
[2721.60 --> 2724.40]  It's not gonna work that way anymore. That's the thing
[2724.40 --> 2728.88]  I mean apple's m2 is not even on a whole new process node
[2729.60 --> 2735.44]  It costs so many billions of dollars. That's just to keep having transistors shrink. It's it's not going to keep up anymore
[2735.92 --> 2737.20]  uh
[2737.20 --> 2738.08]  Hmm
[2738.08 --> 2742.48]  I think we might start running into different types of computing though. People are like bad take linus
[2743.28 --> 2746.96]  Okay, I mean can I can I do this again? Do I have to do this again guys?
[2746.96 --> 2751.60]  Obviously, I'm having a little fun with him right now
[2752.64 --> 2757.52]  Obviously, okay, let us do our thing. We're okay. You don't have to come to linus's defense every time
[2757.76 --> 2763.28]  He's he's a you know, he's a grown man. He can take care of himself. No, they're not coming to my defense. They're telling me it's a bad take
[2764.00 --> 2767.60]  Yeah, look the point the point is the point is
[2768.16 --> 2774.00]  Yeah margins have clearly gone up in that industry, but also investment into new technology in that industry has gone up
[2774.00 --> 2778.40]  Yeah, and I don't think we're gonna we're not gonna be able to take for granted
[2778.72 --> 2783.04]  Pretty sure margins have gone up go down. I'm pretty sure margins have gone up more than investment has gone up
[2783.76 --> 2789.68]  Um, I mean over the like since the pandemic with the inflation. Yeah, yes
[2790.16 --> 2793.12]  But in the couple of years prior to that I actually don't know
[2793.52 --> 2798.56]  We should we should everyone should start referring to inflation in quotations. I would actually be fantastic
[2798.56 --> 2804.32]  NVIDIA's margins have gone up consistently, but a lot of that is shifting from gaming into new segments like
[2804.64 --> 2810.88]  AI, HPC, data center, right? That's not from them actually just making way more money on gaming cards. Yeah
[2812.72 --> 2817.52]  But also their reinvestment has gone heavily into those sections. Yeah, yeah, that's true
[2818.48 --> 2819.52]  I don't know
[2819.52 --> 2820.40]  um
[2820.40 --> 2824.24]  But yeah, I think I think we'll eventually start hitting different types of computing
[2824.24 --> 2829.60]  Um, like we've been sort of talking about for a long time, but it's it's still gonna take quite a while
[2829.60 --> 2835.12]  I think people have been thinking that those like alternative forms of computing are like, oh, they're like two years away
[2835.12 --> 2837.52]  It's like no, they're probably closer to like 20
[2838.64 --> 2840.64]  But yeah, it is what it is
[2842.16 --> 2847.84]  I think it's time for us to do some merch messages you guys may or may not have noticed but we just
[2849.20 --> 2852.80]  Pushed a big big launch on lttstore
[2852.80 --> 2856.24]  Is it out of season? Yes
[2857.60 --> 2863.84]  But does it look amazing? I mean look it's always in it's always in season if you're inside with the ac on okay?
[2864.16 --> 2868.48]  It makes colton look good. Whoa, this is the short circuit
[2869.68 --> 2872.40]  It's basically the same hoodie as the wan hoodie
[2873.12 --> 2879.60]  But with this sick short circuit colorway. Hey, did we just reveal a new employee?
[2879.60 --> 2883.68]  This is natalie from the creator warehouse team. Oh, maybe you guys are meeting her for the first time
[2884.32 --> 2885.44]  I've got riley
[2886.40 --> 2888.40]  Looking a little sus
[2888.40 --> 2890.40]  Look at a little sus riley
[2891.20 --> 2893.84]  Showing off all the zippers got the phone pocket
[2894.48 --> 2896.00]  There's james modeling
[2896.56 --> 2898.72]  I like this. That's a good pose. That's fun
[2899.28 --> 2903.20]  Uh, yes, we know that half the pockets are not that useful or easy to use
[2903.20 --> 2908.40]  But they're just cool. Don't care. They're just awesome. We just love pockets and love zippers. What are you gonna?
[2908.80 --> 2909.92]  What are you gonna do about it?
[2909.92 --> 2915.52]  Keep a blast drive with like three different os installations on them on it and keep it in like a random arm pocket
[2915.76 --> 2918.40]  And whenever whenever the time comes it'll be awesome
[2918.56 --> 2923.44]  Man, i've been so excited to launch this product for so long guys. It looks so freaking good
[2923.44 --> 2931.44]  I really I really like the colors. You know what you know, we didn't show very well in the uh in the imagery
[2931.68 --> 2933.28]  I don't think I saw anyone wearing the hood
[2934.32 --> 2939.28]  The purple yeah the sick purple lining on the hood. Yeah, it's awesome. I think it's cool
[2939.28 --> 2943.68]  Just when it's like resting on your shoulders little accents and stuff. It's a really colors
[2943.68 --> 2949.76]  So wan hoodie and this one because they're basically under the underlying garment is the same. Um
[2950.64 --> 2957.20]  They're extremely technical garments. It took a really really long time for us to get them produced
[2957.60 --> 2962.08]  And the delay on this one was that we wanted to get the gradient printing
[2962.64 --> 2969.52]  Perfect. Yeah, and it's great. So like honestly that was that was probably worth it because the the the this one pops really nicely
[2969.52 --> 2972.32]  You should have seen the early samples man
[2972.32 --> 2975.76]  We could do the gradient printing here in canada perfectly
[2976.40 --> 2981.92]  But the garment production was like I don't know you want to spend 300 on a hoodie. Okay, um
[2982.48 --> 2987.68]  Or we could do the garment production overseas, but the gradient printing looked
[2988.64 --> 2990.24]  awful
[2990.24 --> 2992.56]  So it was like well, we've got we've got
[2993.36 --> 2995.52]  Half of a solution either way
[2996.24 --> 2998.72]  I guess we're boned and you might think well
[2998.72 --> 3001.20]  Why don't you just produce them over there and print them here?
[3001.20 --> 3004.64]  Well, the problem is that because the panels are
[3005.12 --> 3007.92]  Are pre-printed and then sewn?
[3008.56 --> 3011.68]  That's how you get that super super seamless look
[3012.40 --> 3016.16]  Like here on the shoulder as well. Yeah, you you can't do that
[3016.80 --> 3022.00]  You have to print it then assemble it. Gotcha. Yeah, so and that's a lot of shipping
[3023.04 --> 3025.04]  Freakin love it
[3025.04 --> 3028.56]  Love it bite pond says love the processor hoodie. The french terry is awesome now
[3028.56 --> 3033.44]  There's a short circuit one a similar colorway. It looks awesome and it's the same material. Yeah, uh, very similar material
[3033.44 --> 3035.68]  I don't know that it's exactly the same material
[3036.64 --> 3042.32]  Don't don't quote me on that. Also. There's an upgrade uh update on screwdriver shafts
[3043.04 --> 3048.72]  Uh, yes, apparently we're gonna sell both black and silver. Yes black shafts will be a limited run
[3049.44 --> 3056.08]  Uh, I can give you guys the full kind of uh, actually I think did uh, did nick do another did nick do a newsletter today?
[3056.32 --> 3057.44]  I can check. Oh
[3058.32 --> 3061.68]  I hope it's sent to this email. I think it's sent to this email
[3062.24 --> 3069.92]  I will check I got in trouble for being logged into my proper email last week because I um, yeah, something bad happened
[3070.08 --> 3072.16]  I don't see anything on this one
[3072.80 --> 3077.76]  I don't see anything either. So i'll just nick sent me a draft of it. So i'm just gonna get that for you guys
[3078.64 --> 3080.64]  cool
[3081.44 --> 3089.20]  Okay, before we jump into today's topic he wrote I want to quickly follow up on last week's hotly debated screwdriver color conversation
[3089.20 --> 3093.20]  That ended in like almost exactly 50 50 some of y'all got where we were coming from
[3093.28 --> 3100.48]  But a lot of people were even if they understood pretty upset by the last minute design change felt kind of rug pulled bait and switched
[3100.88 --> 3103.12]  However, you want to phrase it one of the reasons why we didn't do pre-orders
[3103.68 --> 3106.32]  Yes, because we didn't want you guys to get surprised
[3107.44 --> 3111.60]  Having already paid money by a last minute change. Yeah, however
[3112.72 --> 3118.16]  Even though we think the silver shaft is the right decision for for the the long-term
[3118.64 --> 3120.64]  Enjoyment of the product
[3120.72 --> 3125.28]  We understand that some of you do not agree and for those of you who do not agree
[3125.84 --> 3130.40]  We've decided that we are going to offer both versions man. There's so many
[3131.04 --> 3135.60]  It was really frustrating seeing a lot of the comments around this some people I think really got it and other people
[3135.92 --> 3141.44]  Like I don't know if it's like a tinfoil hat thing or whatever else people were speculating that we were trying to save a buck
[3141.76 --> 3146.56]  It's not about that at all. I I was the one who pushed for a black shaft
[3146.56 --> 3150.08]  We tried so many different ways to get the black shaft to work
[3150.72 --> 3153.84]  And it was like they all have the same fundamental issue
[3154.32 --> 3160.24]  We want a stainless steel shaft because it's super strong. We want this thing to last a lifetime
[3160.80 --> 3161.12]  And
[3161.12 --> 3167.12]  That is the way to do that and stainless steel whether you're talking cerakote
[3167.28 --> 3171.04]  Whether you're talking dark nickel plating no matter what it is
[3171.04 --> 3172.80]  You get into like really exotic
[3173.44 --> 3178.96]  Ways of turning it black at the end of the day. They're all deposition
[3179.28 --> 3184.32]  They're all a surface layer on top of it and they will eventually chip
[3184.72 --> 3186.56]  So it's always going to be the same problem
[3187.20 --> 3191.60]  Which is why we settled on the silver shaft with that said at launch
[3191.60 --> 3198.00]  We are going to offer people the ability to backorder a black shaft version of either
[3198.32 --> 3202.56]  the all black or the black and orange colorway and then we will just
[3203.20 --> 3205.44]  discontinue it at some point and
[3205.92 --> 3209.68]  Then the silver one will be the one that continues long term
[3210.24 --> 3211.04]  so
[3211.04 --> 3215.44]  Whatever whatever reason you have for wanting a black one whether you just want it as like a
[3215.44 --> 3221.52]  A limited edition item and you won't use it or whether you like that wear that worn out look
[3222.56 --> 3225.60]  We will we will get you guys taken care of all right
[3226.48 --> 3231.36]  Silver fours are faster says cerakote is stupid tough though. It takes a legit beating i'm right
[3231.36 --> 3234.16]  It has its own issues though. It's not great with skin oils
[3234.96 --> 3237.44]  And it will eventually chip
[3238.16 --> 3243.28]  Because what the thing about that dark if it's not great with skin oils a lot of people are going to want to turn by the shaft
[3243.28 --> 3247.68]  Yeah, well, it's designed for that a dark nickel plating is really tough, too
[3248.08 --> 3255.44]  Like that's a freaking awesome coating. We were really happy with the toughness until I actually used the thing for three months
[3256.00 --> 3260.88]  Or six months. I had one of them actually started and they just it's not that it's like it breaks down
[3260.88 --> 3264.48]  It's that there's certain wear points that get hit a lot. Okay. Yeah
[3264.80 --> 3267.44]  Particularly if you're building computers, you're like digging in
[3268.40 --> 3275.36]  Through a heat sink or something and there's a spot that's literally got a heat sink fin right next to it as you are turning the driver
[3275.84 --> 3278.80]  That's gonna that's gonna destroy any finish
[3279.84 --> 3284.72]  So we're gonna get you don't forget to season your screwdriver says technician. Yeah, exactly
[3286.80 --> 3288.80]  Exactly
[3290.08 --> 3294.24]  Is the silver also nickel plated no it is raw stainless steel
[3294.24 --> 3301.92]  So my expectation is that it will look pretty much like it does on day one on day 100 and on day 1000
[3303.92 --> 3305.92]  Silver only in the pop-up
[3306.40 --> 3310.80]  It'll be silver only at the pop-up shop. Yeah, I don't think we'll have any black screwdrivers there
[3311.12 --> 3313.76]  Ooh, I have some exciting news about the pop-up shop though
[3314.48 --> 3318.16]  Confirmed we are going to have we weren't able to get a ton of them
[3318.72 --> 3326.00]  300 units of backpack nice nice nice we're getting the like top of production backpacks air shipped
[3326.88 --> 3329.60]  It's costing 56 dollars a unit
[3330.72 --> 3332.72]  to airship them
[3333.92 --> 3335.92]  Oh geez
[3338.72 --> 3341.84]  Do you have a rough uh, do you have a rough timeline for the pop-up shop?
[3341.84 --> 3347.60]  Yeah, I do actually I I can't how are you gonna um, how are you gonna control attendance?
[3348.64 --> 3349.04]  uh
[3349.04 --> 3350.56]  I
[3350.56 --> 3358.96]  Don't know. Oh, one of the ways we're going to control attendance is we are only going to announce the final date at the last minute
[3359.68 --> 3364.40]  We don't local people. We do not want people traveling around the world for this like i'm sorry
[3364.88 --> 3366.88]  But we cannot have
[3366.88 --> 3368.88]  5 000 people show up
[3368.88 --> 3370.72]  That would be a huge problem. It would be
[3371.12 --> 3375.92]  Uh, so where we're planning on having it like that just doesn't work. Yeah, i'm i'm i'm yeah, well
[3376.56 --> 3379.92]  We're just gonna yeah, we'll do it la a last minute announcement
[3380.56 --> 3383.04]  uh, do not travel for this
[3383.84 --> 3388.00]  Uh, we're working on uh trying to figure out how to do tickets for the land
[3388.96 --> 3393.44]  So people can like pixie eating and stuff like that. Oh, okay. That would be cool. Yeah
[3393.44 --> 3396.72]  I don't actually see the dates for the pop-up shop, but it will be
[3397.36 --> 3401.36]  If you were to buy a backpack at the pop-up shop, you would have it for back to school
[3402.64 --> 3405.12]  Okay, yeah, I can say that much. Yeah, yeah
[3408.08 --> 3409.36]  All right merch messages
[3410.00 --> 3416.40]  Oh, yeah, we should definitely do some merch messages because we've got a lot of them this week. My goodness, you guys are into this short circuit hoodie
[3416.96 --> 3417.68]  um,
[3417.68 --> 3420.64]  Tommy says oh, sorry bell, that's your job union grievance
[3420.64 --> 3429.44]  Oh my goodness, tommy says for luke any tips on how to find the lioness in your life both in mentorship and friendship sense
[3433.36 --> 3435.52]  Okay, we're gonna loop cam for this and i'll see you later
[3436.32 --> 3438.24]  Probably don't take the route that I did
[3439.76 --> 3443.04]  Uh, okay care to explain because I highly recommend
[3443.04 --> 3448.00]  Uh, not doing that to me. Um, because I mean I like lied on my resume
[3448.56 --> 3451.52]  And then we had like a how long was our interview?
[3452.96 --> 3458.32]  I don't know like hours. Yeah, we like many hours. I think we stayed like after the office was closed
[3459.20 --> 3465.04]  You had to drive me home because the buses stopped our interview was like legitimately like I think like six hours or something
[3465.92 --> 3470.00]  And I brought like a super nintendo and he was late because he's late to everything so
[3470.56 --> 3477.12]  When our us first meeting I I think it was like half an hour late or something and i'm in school at this time and i'm like
[3478.24 --> 3478.88]  Hmm
[3478.88 --> 3483.20]  I was at the top of some of my classes, but I was like pretty high-end in general. So I like
[3483.92 --> 3486.88]  Wasn't thinking I was actually gonna get the job. So i'm like, okay, well i'm gonna study
[3487.52 --> 3489.28]  It's like I need to keep my school stuff going
[3489.28 --> 3493.92]  So by the time he comes down I have like papers all over the place and my laptop's out and i'm working and stuff
[3494.16 --> 3496.16]  it was uh
[3496.24 --> 3498.24]  Honestly, very unprofessional
[3500.80 --> 3502.08]  Um
[3502.16 --> 3504.16]  Yeah, I don't know. Uh, I think
[3505.60 --> 3507.76]  If you can afford to
[3509.12 --> 3510.80]  Try to take some chances
[3512.16 --> 3515.60]  When you have less responsibilities, um
[3516.48 --> 3519.04]  Yeah, it's it's dangerous advice. So I feel
[3519.28 --> 3521.28]  It's tough
[3521.76 --> 3522.32]  Worried
[3522.32 --> 3528.56]  I feel the same way when I talk about you know something like yvonne like how do you find the yvonne in your life and it's like
[3529.52 --> 3531.44]  I don't know get really lucky. Yeah
[3532.08 --> 3533.12]  Yeah, um
[3533.92 --> 3536.32]  Like I I try I tried things that were
[3537.68 --> 3540.16]  Uh non-conventional before I tried
[3541.04 --> 3547.04]  Working with you on youtube videos like I had done other like weird odd things to try to see if I could find success
[3547.04 --> 3549.12]  I don't know if i've ever sought out friends
[3551.52 --> 3552.08]  To be fair
[3553.04 --> 3555.20]  We didn't meet by seeking out friends
[3555.20 --> 3560.16]  Yeah, but that's the thing is like I I think but I think that was the question right like how do you find oh
[3560.16 --> 3563.76]  I guess there was the mentorship and mentorship thing and that could be a professional
[3566.24 --> 3571.60]  They asked you but I would say being open to mentorship is a huge part of finding mentors
[3571.60 --> 3573.12]  I found great mentors
[3573.12 --> 3577.84]  That's fair yeah, uh, you won't they won't keep you around if you don't
[3578.56 --> 3583.36]  Listen and adapt and and change and and seek to better yourself. They can't
[3583.84 --> 3587.44]  They can't change you you have to want to change so that's something
[3587.44 --> 3591.28]  Alex steel actually has a a take on that that I think is pretty good
[3591.28 --> 3593.60]  Yeah, which is that you have to be worth their time
[3594.72 --> 3600.08]  So if you if you want to like if you want a mentor in a field be worth their time
[3600.80 --> 3603.76]  um, so like find a way to be valuable to them
[3604.32 --> 3605.28]  uh, and then
[3605.92 --> 3609.68]  If if I mean if they're like a good person that will be rewarded, right?
[3609.68 --> 3613.76]  That actually reminds me uh, my badminton coach right now
[3613.76 --> 3616.08]  um, um is like
[3617.20 --> 3623.44]  One of those people where I work really really hard because he could just not yeah
[3623.44 --> 3628.24]  And he could get paid by someone who has a chance to you know represent
[3629.36 --> 3633.44]  uh, you know us at nationals and or like internationally
[3633.44 --> 3637.60]  He could just like train them instead and i'm just like some over the hill like
[3638.72 --> 3640.80]  Tech guy who just wants to get better at the game
[3640.80 --> 3646.24]  Um, like yes, I you know i'm paying obviously he's not cheap
[3646.80 --> 3654.88]  But he doesn't have to train me someone else would pay and so I work my ass off in training like I go hard
[3654.88 --> 3663.12]  I honestly I end up with my brain as tired as my body at the end of a two-hour session because i'm just trying not to do anything wrong
[3663.12 --> 3664.56]  Yeah, um
[3664.56 --> 3670.40]  I used to I used to edit videos in class and I would have to walk between classes with my laptop open
[3670.80 --> 3675.28]  in my hand because if it was close like I could close with screen on whatever
[3675.28 --> 3680.00]  But it would like get too hot so like literally just having the screen away from the laptop would help it
[3680.64 --> 3686.08]  Because it was like such a struggle. Um, I mean we've told stories about how little sleep I used to get
[3686.08 --> 3687.92]  Yeah, um
[3687.92 --> 3689.92]  Yeah, you gotta be worth the time
[3689.92 --> 3691.92]  Yeah, I probably went a little hard
[3691.92 --> 3693.76]  Um, but you do that you probably
[3694.72 --> 3695.60]  It's kind of your charm
[3696.64 --> 3701.84]  Um, but but yeah, and you don't have to go that far but but yeah try to be worth their time
[3702.48 --> 3705.52]  Um, and and you can do that in a variety of ways you can do that the way
[3705.84 --> 3709.20]  Linus is doing with the badminton coach of just like making it very clear that your
[3710.24 --> 3715.52]  Effort level is extremely high so that they feel like their investment in you is worth something
[3715.52 --> 3718.80]  Yeah, because good teachers don't teach for money
[3719.60 --> 3722.32]  Good teachers love to teach and
[3723.04 --> 3726.48]  Love that they can make money and and live comfortably
[3727.04 --> 3732.40]  Um, by doing what they're passionate about. It's like it's it's that whole it's that whole thing find a job
[3732.40 --> 3734.48]  You love and never work another day in your life or whatever
[3734.64 --> 3739.84]  It's not rewarding to teach someone who's just not paying attention or caring. No, it's so
[3740.72 --> 3747.36]  Demoralizing. Yeah, so absolutely demoralizing care a lot try really hard and understand that things might be
[3747.68 --> 3754.80]  Uncomfortable or not like the absolute most beneficial but make sure that you're choosing the right person so that it will be
[3755.52 --> 3758.64]  Beneficial eventually if you know what I mean, uh, yeah
[3759.28 --> 3763.04]  Uh, okay, hold on people are people are taking exception with my whole
[3763.60 --> 3769.52]  Uh being over the hill from a professional athletic standpoint. Yeah 35 is pretty over the hill
[3770.00 --> 3772.32]  Over the hill is relative like esports
[3773.44 --> 3780.48]  You hit 25. What are you doing? What are you doing here? Old man? Yeah, like it's your your reflexes are just not as good
[3780.48 --> 3784.40]  What is it the I I surprised someone with this the other day? Um, when
[3785.36 --> 3789.52]  What age does your reaction time slow down?
[3790.48 --> 3791.68]  24. Yeah
[3792.96 --> 3796.88]  Yep, sorry every day I get slower
[3796.88 --> 3798.40]  And dumber
[3798.40 --> 3802.48]  I can feel in fps games weaker and I know I had this conversation recently
[3802.48 --> 3805.52]  I know I don't play fps games as much as I used to stuff like that
[3805.52 --> 3810.32]  Like that's definitely part of it, but I I can feel it. I can't twitch like I used to be able to like I
[3811.76 --> 3814.56]  I just it's just it just doesn't happen as fast
[3814.56 --> 3817.04]  Like it's not it's not that I don't play the games as much
[3817.28 --> 3821.28]  I just it's just the the connection is just not as good as it used to be
[3821.68 --> 3824.64]  It just isn't uh, and that's I mean that's fine
[3824.88 --> 3829.28]  But like i'm not gonna be able to be as good as I used to be which kind of sucks
[3829.28 --> 3832.96]  But it is what it is like it's it's fine. You'll probably still do okay at the land
[3834.16 --> 3836.16]  You can carry me. Okay, okay
[3836.16 --> 3843.20]  Uh, oh, uh, joe's probably gonna come up nice
[3843.44 --> 3847.20]  So he can maybe carry both of us gonna be awesome. Yeah, joe could joe can hard carry
[3849.28 --> 3850.80]  Next questions from samir
[3851.36 --> 3856.16]  What changes other than more creators are you planning for the next ltx with it being the first one back after so long?
[3856.80 --> 3863.20]  Definitely we want a lot more cool technology for people to check out so not just sponsor booths where they're showing like
[3863.84 --> 3868.00]  Their new thing they launched or whatever want everything to be super interactive
[3868.00 --> 3870.88]  We did an okay job of that one at the last time at the last one
[3871.20 --> 3874.16]  But I think we can do better and one of the other big ones is that
[3874.88 --> 3876.88]  Whether it's through
[3876.88 --> 3882.16]  Volunteers or whether it's through hires we want to make sure that the lmg
[3882.40 --> 3886.64]  Personalities that you guys want to interact with are not bogged down running booths
[3887.20 --> 3891.84]  We want there to be way more interaction with creators at the show nice cool
[3893.20 --> 3895.20]  So
[3895.20 --> 3898.96]  From connor for luke. What's been the hardest challenge?
[3898.96 --> 3901.60]  Uh tech challenge you faced building float plane
[3901.60 --> 3903.60]  Tech challenge. Um
[3904.24 --> 3908.56]  What tech challenge have you not faced building float plane that might be an easier question to answer?
[3908.56 --> 3909.84]  It has been a lot. Um
[3910.40 --> 3912.64]  We made a framework choice early on
[3913.36 --> 3917.44]  Um that honestly at the time with the information that we had
[3918.16 --> 3922.72]  Uh, like if I if I could it's hard, but if I could put myself back in those shoes
[3922.72 --> 3927.68]  And if I could look at the resources that we had at that time, it seemed like a pretty solid idea
[3928.32 --> 3935.12]  Um, but it like fairly quickly became effectively abandoned where and it was a it was a framework that we were sitting on so
[3935.12 --> 3940.56]  That has been quite the pain. Um
[3941.44 --> 3942.96]  That has been rough. That's one
[3942.96 --> 3943.52]  That's one
[3943.52 --> 3947.44]  Sales sales. Yeah, that that that's probably been the the
[3948.32 --> 3952.56]  I know that's maybe not what you're looking for, but yeah selecting the the wrong framework
[3953.52 --> 3955.28]  I guess, um
[3955.28 --> 3958.80]  Has been has been and was and will be very painful
[3958.80 --> 3961.36]  Uh, but we're we're dealing with it. It's fine
[3963.68 --> 3969.92]  From matthew also for luke. Where did you want ltt to move originally cam loops bc interior someone alberta
[3971.68 --> 3972.16]  Taiwan
[3973.20 --> 3974.64]  Yeah, it was a bit of a long shot
[3975.84 --> 3981.36]  Uh, I also had suggested other places, but taiwan was taiwan was it really that it's it's a
[3982.16 --> 3983.84]  It's a tech center. Um
[3983.84 --> 3992.40]  Um, the the cost of living ratio like we've always had this thing where like a lot of the income for for linus media group was was usd
[3993.12 --> 4001.20]  Um, so the conversion, uh into ntd would have been very beneficial for us. Yeah, like it it would have been very
[4002.72 --> 4008.40]  I could have paid you guys like pauper wages and you could have lived like kings. Yeah, like
[4009.92 --> 4013.76]  It was it looked pretty good from the business side, but it I mean
[4013.84 --> 4018.00]  It's also across the world and like you were having kids and like I I get it. I understand why it was difficult
[4018.00 --> 4024.08]  It's just that there was a lot of variables at the time that were like, whoa, this could be like really positive. Um
[4025.68 --> 4027.68]  It's uh
[4029.12 --> 4031.12]  There's people in
[4031.12 --> 4036.40]  Chat going like whoa sales. Yeah at the time it looked really cool. Okay, it just got abandoned
[4036.56 --> 4043.52]  It could have been cool if they kept working on it anyways, um, but yeah, the taiwan was the the like big one that I really wanted to push for
[4043.84 --> 4046.00]  When that fell through I think at one point in time
[4046.00 --> 4051.76]  I was just like please anywhere else in canada because especially when we started hiring developers. It's like oh man
[4052.40 --> 4054.32]  I was super into vancouver washington
[4055.84 --> 4057.44]  Just because it's like
[4059.44 --> 4065.92]  No income tax because washington state and you can cross border shop in oregon for no sales tax
[4066.56 --> 4067.44]  man
[4067.44 --> 4070.32]  again like living like kings
[4070.88 --> 4072.88]  Would have been kind of amazing
[4074.16 --> 4080.48]  But vancouver is also pretty sick. Vancouver has benefits. It's pretty nice that like if I feel like snowboarding
[4080.48 --> 4086.72]  I can literally go snowboarding in the middle of the week after work and be home for like a late dinner and
[4087.20 --> 4092.00]  Wake up refreshed in the morning. Like that's actually crazy that that's even possible. Um
[4092.88 --> 4095.92]  And there's like yeah, vancouver is a cool place. It's just
[4097.04 --> 4100.16]  Really really expensive. Yeah
[4100.96 --> 4101.20]  Yeah
[4101.20 --> 4107.92]  Speaking of expensive from alan for your home theater linus if you didn't go with svs for your main setup
[4107.92 --> 4110.48]  Were there any other speakers or tech that you were interested in checking out?
[4110.48 --> 4114.56]  It's a space that I honestly just haven't followed that closely because it's been
[4114.56 --> 4118.96]  I've spent my entire life with it either out of my price range
[4119.68 --> 4120.00]  Or
[4120.56 --> 4124.32]  Irrelevant because I have absolutely nowhere to put a product like that
[4124.80 --> 4127.04]  It's also like it's a space that honestly
[4127.84 --> 4128.80]  So much take oil
[4129.44 --> 4132.48]  And like not everyone's really even invited
[4133.20 --> 4133.52]  Yeah
[4134.08 --> 4134.96]  You know what I mean?
[4134.96 --> 4136.08]  Yep, I do know what you mean
[4136.08 --> 4137.76]  Like if you're not big mega baller
[4138.88 --> 4140.08]  They don't care
[4140.08 --> 4140.40]  Yeah
[4140.40 --> 4144.88]  At all and they're they're not even advertising to you like you you might not even know what it is
[4144.88 --> 4147.44]  You've possibly never even heard of it. It's uh
[4148.16 --> 4151.28]  It's yeah, it's crazy. I mean, I know I know kef
[4151.76 --> 4161.84]  Um, I I used to have just some some like a kef 5.1 satellite set up and then like an avr receiver hooked up to my computer like way back before that was cool
[4163.84 --> 4167.84]  I was really happy with those. I like the sound signature, but I haven't looked at their products in
[4167.84 --> 4172.72]  15 years or 12 years or whatever that works out to so I just
[4174.08 --> 4179.20]  I don't know I I I went with svs based on I think it was james's recommendation
[4179.84 --> 4184.24]  And it sounds great. We haven't even treated the room properly yet and it sounds
[4185.04 --> 4185.44]  Great
[4187.28 --> 4191.04]  From isaac question for both of you. What's a video you're most proud of?
[4191.04 --> 4193.04]  Oh
[4197.60 --> 4202.16]  I don't know man, that's a tough every time someone asks me what's the video your most
[4203.04 --> 4207.44]  I have to go through a backlog of like 10 000 videos. Yeah, it's a lot of work
[4208.00 --> 4213.52]  I feel like no matter what I say i'm gonna give you the wrong answer. So why don't I just pick something recent?
[4213.52 --> 4221.04]  Um, it was it was really exciting for me to be one of the few people ever invited to film inside an intel fab
[4221.76 --> 4222.08]  um
[4222.88 --> 4228.64]  And to to do the same thing at an ibm development lab like a month apart
[4229.36 --> 4234.00]  It's just those were really cool. Yeah, those yeah, those were really that's like uh, that that's like
[4234.40 --> 4238.56]  Yeah, because you know, there's tons of haters that are like oh hashtag lie
[4238.56 --> 4245.60]  Nuss, you know, he's just a youtuber, you know, whatever else right then where I'll I'll question it
[4246.16 --> 4248.64]  And then I'll go and I'll do something like that
[4249.28 --> 4255.36]  And I'll hear that feedback at the you know from people who have worked in the fab
[4256.48 --> 4260.80]  In the in the in the fab silo at intel for over a decade
[4261.52 --> 4266.88]  Uh, you know watch these videos and go like yeah, no one else has really captured
[4267.68 --> 4269.36]  What goes into this?
[4269.36 --> 4273.52]  Like this before like and I go like oh, yeah, no i'm actually really good at this
[4273.84 --> 4277.84]  Like I know I don't I don't have the deepest knowledge of of everything
[4278.32 --> 4280.48]  But what I feel like if I had a superpower
[4280.48 --> 4283.76]  I feel like my superpower is knowing enough to ask the right questions
[4284.24 --> 4285.68]  because
[4285.68 --> 4286.80]  You know
[4286.80 --> 4291.28]  I see what I do in a in a video like that as really easy
[4291.28 --> 4293.44]  Because all I do is listen
[4293.44 --> 4297.04]  I just listen and I type really fast
[4297.44 --> 4303.12]  So I just listen and I transcribe and then I filter out stuff that's boring
[4303.52 --> 4310.64]  And I leave in the interesting stuff and I reorder it and then I put on my presenter voice and I get all enthusiastic because I am
[4310.88 --> 4311.76]  Yeah
[4311.76 --> 4314.88]  And that's it a lot easier when you genuinely are that's a video, right?
[4314.88 --> 4315.84]  And
[4315.84 --> 4320.72]  What I what I was trying to figure out is like well, why can't just why can't any reporter?
[4321.36 --> 4322.32]  Just just do that
[4322.80 --> 4325.68]  And I think the answer is because they don't ask the right questions
[4326.00 --> 4329.28]  They don't know who the right people to talk to are yeah, and they don't listen
[4329.28 --> 4339.04]  I've had a lot of comments in flow plane chat that have mentioned a lot of videos that I I think could be fantastic contenders for me
[4339.28 --> 4343.44]  I've also had a lot of people that have posted things like pizza warmer, which is definitely not it
[4345.20 --> 4349.12]  That moment when you completely misunderstood the concept of the video
[4350.96 --> 4351.20]  Um
[4352.48 --> 4354.96]  Someone someone brought up scrappy edwards 4 that was like
[4356.72 --> 4357.52]  That's probably
[4358.48 --> 4359.52]  Is that the flaming one?
[4359.52 --> 4361.36]  Yeah, that was really cool
[4361.92 --> 4368.16]  Like I actually really really enjoyed making that with with rod that was that was quite the positive experience
[4368.40 --> 4372.24]  I also really liked my uh, wtf is going on with
[4373.20 --> 4378.00]  Those like few videos that I did in that strain that was probably not at the right time and it
[4378.00 --> 4380.64]  I loved the one on the neptune pine it was really funny
[4380.64 --> 4383.04]  Oh that kick farted yeah kick farted was cool
[4383.04 --> 4386.96]  Uh, there just wasn't really enough stuff to like cover that was actually good to cover
[4386.96 --> 4390.64]  But yeah, neptune pine kick farted was really fantastic. Yeah, but
[4391.36 --> 4393.60]  You're asking for stuff that is
[4394.24 --> 4397.92]  Not good enough to be good and not bad enough to not ship
[4397.92 --> 4399.92]  So that's this really narrow slice
[4399.92 --> 4400.96]  Yeah, there's right
[4400.96 --> 4404.00]  You got your neptune pine you got your g-bow you got you
[4405.28 --> 4409.84]  You kind of genuinely run out like on a hand or two like there's really not that many items
[4410.32 --> 4413.68]  Um follow up on pc. I wouldn't say that was my favorite
[4414.16 --> 4414.48]  Um
[4415.36 --> 4422.64]  It was cool, but I wouldn't say it was my favorite like I enjoyed making the the scrap red wars for flaming computer more than I enjoyed making the fallout bomb
[4422.64 --> 4424.64]  That was super cool. Um
[4425.12 --> 4426.64]  Yeah, I don't know. There's been lots though
[4427.52 --> 4429.52]  How to hide your yeah
[4431.12 --> 4433.12]  Still valid today
[4433.36 --> 4437.28]  Just have to make sure my kids don't find it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some good tips in there
[4439.52 --> 4441.52]  Pun intended
[4441.52 --> 4448.80]  From matt if I have a water loop that the top is five feet above the pump and reservoir
[4449.44 --> 4450.72]  What what should I do or use?
[4452.40 --> 4453.44]  um
[4453.44 --> 4454.40]  Why
[4456.40 --> 4457.44]  I mean good question
[4457.44 --> 4462.32]  I think the d5 has over five feet ahead use a d5 you're probably gonna have to turn it up a little bit
[4463.28 --> 4469.28]  D5 head pressure. I generally like running d5s really low because they get nice maximum head pressure of 3.9 meters
[4469.28 --> 4472.24]  Yeah, just use a d5 there easy easy answer very reliable
[4475.04 --> 4478.88]  From chris lonis and luke do you think micro led and mini leds
[4479.36 --> 4483.92]  led tvs will stay relevant with the way oled and qd oled technology is advancing
[4486.56 --> 4488.88]  micro led is
[4490.08 --> 4496.00]  Going to be an interesting one mini led is going to be a low cost option for quite some time
[4496.00 --> 4500.32]  I'm gonna say costing reasons. I think yes. Yeah, uh, well, oh sort of okay
[4500.32 --> 4505.12]  So the problem with mini led is that it can only get so cheap because you have to have the logic
[4505.68 --> 4509.52]  To drive that full array local dimming in order to benefit from mini led
[4509.60 --> 4514.08]  Because if you're not packing the leds in super tight, why did you bother to use mini leds?
[4514.80 --> 4515.12]  um
[4516.32 --> 4519.28]  So yeah, milli mini led does it get kind of pushed out
[4519.84 --> 4523.76]  By more traditional just edge lit basic tvs on the one side and then
[4524.24 --> 4527.20]  Qd oled like sort of oled backlighting over
[4527.84 --> 4532.32]  Like a quantum dot layer on the other side or just lg getting more aggressive with w oled
[4532.32 --> 4535.84]  I I I don't I don't know. I don't know what mini leds future places
[4537.12 --> 4539.36]  But micro led still has
[4539.36 --> 4552.32]  Displays and if uh if if the cost can get competitive enough it could be the only thing that matters
[4552.88 --> 4557.20]  Because as tv sizes as consumers demand larger and larger tvs
[4557.76 --> 4562.00]  It's not going to be practical to ship them as a monolithic piece of glass
[4562.00 --> 4568.48]  Uh, like you won't be able to transport these 100 plus inch tvs. So modular
[4569.04 --> 4572.64]  TVs right now my audio no audio. Oh audio died
[4574.80 --> 4582.40]  I was back apparently micro leds are to my knowledge the best way to create a modular display at this time
[4582.96 --> 4587.20]  And modular has benefits both for transport as well as for
[4588.00 --> 4591.76]  um manufacturing to building many small panels
[4592.24 --> 4599.84]  Could yield or could help you achieve better product yields than really really large pieces of glass
[4600.32 --> 4605.20]  Uh cut from the mother glass also green size displays. Yeah extreme sizes
[4605.84 --> 4608.64]  Also, uh different uh aspect ratios
[4609.20 --> 4613.60]  So micro led displays could be a great way to have you know
[4613.60 --> 4620.64]  Like a 21 by 9 display setup other than a projector like I see I absolutely see
[4622.00 --> 4624.00]  A future for that technology
[4624.24 --> 4626.48]  Like in the home in the home tv space. I'm not
[4627.12 --> 4628.96]  Obviously, there's other applications for it
[4633.28 --> 4636.88]  I don't know for sure. I mean rollable rollable oleds
[4637.68 --> 4640.00]  Yeah, that could be that could be the way to tackle transport
[4640.80 --> 4642.80]  And you could have your tv in a tube
[4642.80 --> 4643.52]  Yeah, tube tv
[4643.52 --> 4651.36]  That would actually be amazing if someone if someone like marks it that way. Yeah buy a tube tv today
[4654.88 --> 4656.24]  I think you can actually go now
[4656.24 --> 4660.16]  I was making 100% sure from cameron uh about the screwdriver
[4660.56 --> 4664.56]  Does it have a gearless ratchet system or is it a really fine tooth racket ratchet?
[4665.68 --> 4668.16]  Uh, it's not it's not like gearless
[4668.16 --> 4668.88]  Fine teeth, right?
[4668.88 --> 4670.16]  Fine teeth, yes
[4670.16 --> 4674.64]  There's a there's as far as I know there I have one at home actually a gearless one
[4675.60 --> 4678.96]  Oh, oh like the roller gear or roll gear or whatever it is
[4678.96 --> 4685.76]  I think that's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen those. Um, I like the feel I like the sound of of a ratchet
[4686.32 --> 4691.36]  Yes, it's just a really roll gear. That's it. Yeah, it's just a it's just a really um
[4692.16 --> 4693.36]  good ratchet mechanism
[4696.08 --> 4701.44]  From David have you heard about kaleidoscope a high-end home theater alternate to streaming services
[4704.08 --> 4707.12]  I looked it up and it does look pretty interesting. I'm googling it
[4707.12 --> 4714.00]  Right now. Oh boy. I'm getting lots of irrelevant search results because yeah kaleidoscope
[4714.00 --> 4716.88]  um, uh, sorry, it's kaleidoscape
[4717.60 --> 4718.80]  kaleidoscape
[4720.88 --> 4724.48]  Kaleidoscope the okay. Yeah, this is probably not it
[4725.60 --> 4732.64]  Kaleidoscope theater we're all about imagination 2022 to 2023 season got your education programs here
[4732.64 --> 4734.40]  Kaleidoscape
[4734.40 --> 4736.48]  What is what is this? What is this for?
[4738.48 --> 4738.72]  Escape
[4738.72 --> 4742.40]  I don't I don't know because I haven't managed to find it
[4742.96 --> 4745.28]  Kaleidoscape the ultimate movie player
[4747.68 --> 4752.72]  Fidelity source material for the ultimate cinematic experience view comparison
[4752.72 --> 4755.28]  Yeah, this is probably good. Is it a computer?
[4755.28 --> 4759.52]  What are you talking about this? What is what is this footage?
[4762.16 --> 4762.96]  I don't know
[4762.96 --> 4763.52]  uh
[4765.28 --> 4770.48]  Did I tell you about the time that I was at a I was at a convention and I was gonna make a video at a booth
[4770.96 --> 4777.44]  uh, and I started laughing at a piece of marketing they had because it was showing like 60 hertz versus 120 hertz
[4778.00 --> 4783.60]  Uh, and I started laughing and I I went to go like film a thing with it because I was gonna like make fun of it
[4783.60 --> 4787.36]  And one of the people ran over and grabbed it and ran away
[4788.00 --> 4788.96]  Did I tell you about that?
[4789.60 --> 4795.20]  Because they like figured out what I was talking about and I guess they were like more well informed than most of the other people there
[4795.44 --> 4797.44]  And then just like booked it grabbed it and ran
[4798.00 --> 4800.00]  So that you couldn't make a video mocking it
[4800.64 --> 4804.96]  That's hilarious. Mm-hmm. That was epic. So I just mentioned it in the video
[4807.44 --> 4812.08]  It's like you're not fully getting away with that one. I might not be able to capture it on camera, but it happened
[4814.08 --> 4816.16]  I'm sorry, but I just really
[4817.12 --> 4819.84]  Don't understand what I'm looking at here
[4821.12 --> 4823.12]  It's
[4823.12 --> 4825.44]  It seems like a computer. It's a media
[4826.48 --> 4829.20]  Stratos C 4k movie player
[4830.16 --> 4832.16]  So it's a 1u
[4833.12 --> 4834.32]  Thing
[4834.48 --> 4836.48]  Mount it behind the tv
[4836.56 --> 4840.24]  What ultra hd movie player high dynamic range?
[4841.60 --> 4845.52]  What what is it so then what you buy your movies through it or?
[4847.92 --> 4853.52]  What what am I looking at here? There's a lot of fast and furious very fast very furious
[4854.08 --> 4857.44]  I think you do buy your movies through it you buy your movies through them
[4857.44 --> 4861.04]  Yeah, if you click on the the movies button at the top, uh, yes
[4861.04 --> 4866.56]  Like you said you can get every fast and the furious. I believe there's also like 14 000 other ones
[4866.56 --> 4868.80]  Okay, when I purchase it do I
[4869.60 --> 4873.84]  Your only certainly your only source for 4k ultra hd and blu-ray quality downloads
[4874.16 --> 4877.04]  So is it just blu-ray quality because I could just buy blu-rays
[4877.04 --> 4881.04]  Uh, show scenes
[4882.40 --> 4882.72]  I mean
[4883.28 --> 4887.84]  I uh, I don't know. I guess I am learning about this for the first time
[4887.84 --> 4892.96]  And I don't really have any thoughts on it because I don't really understand it
[4894.16 --> 4898.32]  Fully yeah, they say it's blu-ray quality, but in that chart it's supposed to be better than blu-ray
[4898.32 --> 4900.72]  so oh, well this apparently has a
[4901.44 --> 4904.24]  Like double the bitrate of blu-ray version of it
[4904.96 --> 4906.48]  I mean
[4906.48 --> 4911.28]  More bitrate i'm i'm super down but when I buy this what am I buying?
[4911.84 --> 4917.60]  Am I do I actually download this file like do I do I do I keep this file?
[4919.52 --> 4921.44]  I feel like you would download it
[4922.48 --> 4926.80]  To that device which you would not be able to pull it off of if that makes sense. Oh
[4928.24 --> 4930.56]  That would make sense. So you
[4932.00 --> 4935.60]  That's why you might like the hold on a second
[4937.04 --> 4940.64]  Where's the oh my goodness i'm like lost on their site. That's always a good sign
[4940.64 --> 4943.20]  This movie is 42 and a half gigs. Oh
[4943.84 --> 4946.08]  That's not that much gladiator was 95
[4948.80 --> 4951.28]  Hello kleidoscope.com so in a full plane chat
[4952.00 --> 4954.64]  Oh full plane chat is is debating right now
[4956.24 --> 4956.48]  Wow
[4957.76 --> 4961.04]  Probably not about that. I think everyone is fully aware of what just happened
[4961.68 --> 4969.04]  Uh, that's why you've got these different servers with different amounts of storage because whatever you buy is has to go on there
[4969.04 --> 4975.44]  Got to be locked to that for best in class hard drives allow the system to stay up and running in the event of a drive
[4975.44 --> 4976.32]  What are they though?
[4977.04 --> 4981.68]  They're best in class luke. Tell me what they are. They're from a leading hard drive manufacturer
[4982.48 --> 4984.80]  So basically seagate or wd
[4986.96 --> 4988.80]  Because there aren't a lot of other options at this point
[4990.32 --> 4990.96]  Oh man
[4991.76 --> 4995.52]  Increased ability to play back and download content at the same time
[4995.52 --> 4999.52]  How much does one of these cost? How much is a terra movie server?
[5001.60 --> 5006.16]  That's what I hate about this stuff like you don't have pricing on your site
[5006.96 --> 5014.00]  But everyone knows the pricing so you're just making me google it like it why why waste my time just have the pricing there
[5014.64 --> 5017.04]  the 72 terabyte server is
[5017.60 --> 5019.52]  24 000
[5019.52 --> 5022.08]  dollars nice nice awesome wow
[5022.08 --> 5030.40]  All the places that it's available are like super high-end like home design
[5032.48 --> 5032.88]  Stuff
[5033.44 --> 5035.76]  Here's a place sound and vision.com
[5036.48 --> 5039.20]  Wait, is this reviews or like what what even is this?
[5040.00 --> 5040.96]  What oh my goodness?
[5040.96 --> 5042.16]  I mean maybe I have website
[5042.16 --> 5043.76]  Ads everywhere get this out of my way
[5045.52 --> 5049.04]  Man, yeah, okay. This appears to be a review site of some sort
[5049.04 --> 5050.56]  You're in the life
[5050.56 --> 5053.76]  I clicked on one and it just says the future home of something cool
[5054.64 --> 5054.96]  Neat
[5055.84 --> 5056.96]  That doesn't sound like a
[5057.84 --> 5059.84]  Currently operating company
[5062.32 --> 5068.88]  What even am I looking at here me being me I decided to transition just about my full disk collection
[5068.88 --> 5073.60]  And that's why I needed not just one but two 24 terabyte terra servers for my setup
[5073.60 --> 5076.16]  Really?
[5076.16 --> 5076.96]  Hmm
[5076.96 --> 5078.00]  Who are you?
[5082.00 --> 5084.88]  I continue to love and highly recommend this hold on a second
[5086.64 --> 5086.96]  Uh
[5088.80 --> 5089.52]  I don't know
[5092.00 --> 5093.92]  Don't share my screen for a sec. I do
[5094.56 --> 5098.80]  I find this interesting there so this is one of the websites that is apparently a dealer
[5099.28 --> 5102.64]  lux audio video solutions manhattan southampton greenwich
[5103.60 --> 5107.60]  uh, I scrolled down I saw this one i'm like, okay, this almost looks like a render but
[5108.40 --> 5110.56]  for sure I keep scrolling down I see this one
[5111.20 --> 5113.52]  There's there's no seating space in front of that tv
[5113.52 --> 5115.20]  Do you know how much those speakers cost?
[5115.20 --> 5115.44]  No
[5116.08 --> 5119.04]  I think those are meridian speakers
[5119.68 --> 5121.76]  Uh, i'm looking at them real small here hold on
[5121.76 --> 5125.84]  I mean never mind. No, no, I don't think they are
[5125.84 --> 5131.52]  I thought they were the speakers I saw uh, when we did the meridian tour that was uh sponsored by lg
[5132.80 --> 5137.20]  And I was like whoa apparently because apparently they're like a hundred plus grand each
[5137.84 --> 5144.32]  Yeah, you can we can go off it now. Um, but yeah, I just there's no there's no couch or seating space in front of that tv
[5144.80 --> 5149.92]  Uh, and the whole place looks extremely expensive, but it's this like relatively small looking tv
[5149.92 --> 5153.04]  It's just like a weird picture to include. I don't know. It's odd
[5154.64 --> 5158.80]  Yeah, oh check out maybe it was a meridian. Does it did it look like this one does that look right?
[5159.52 --> 5162.32]  Yeah, just white. Yeah, it looked like the one on the on the right. Yeah, okay
[5162.32 --> 5167.84]  Yeah, I think it was yeah that that speaker is like tens of thousands of dollars for one
[5168.48 --> 5170.00]  Wow, okay
[5170.00 --> 5171.52]  kaleidoscope encore
[5172.32 --> 5172.72]  uh
[5174.08 --> 5179.68]  The terra six terabyte version is seven thousand six hundred and fourteen
[5181.28 --> 5182.88]  uh great british pounds
[5184.48 --> 5185.52]  That's some money
[5187.60 --> 5190.80]  That's got to be some real nice hard drives in there, you know
[5190.80 --> 5195.68]  Oh, apparently those meridians are cheaper. They're only fifteen thousand dollars msrp each
[5195.68 --> 5201.44]  Only thirty grand for the pair. Yeah, just thirty grand. Not a big deal. They did sound great
[5202.64 --> 5208.16]  But then again having never additioned a tens of thousands of dollars speaker pair before
[5208.16 --> 5212.08]  You know it sounds great. Not spending thirty grand on speakers sounds great
[5212.80 --> 5217.20]  uh, the 24 okay, let's see here the costing difference between
[5218.00 --> 5219.28]  a
[5219.28 --> 5226.88]  Six terabyte terra so that's the seven thousand six hundred and fourteen pounds and the 12 terabyte terra that goes to
[5227.60 --> 5228.64]  nine thousand pounds
[5229.84 --> 5235.68]  Oh, wow, you actually found somewhere that just has it yeah proper pricing just listed jumping from 12 to 24
[5237.04 --> 5239.04]  That's a lot of money
[5239.04 --> 5241.04]  For some hard drives for some hard drives
[5242.56 --> 5248.40]  Now that's some niche content we could get into. I think apple just got one-upped. That's some niche content we could get into like
[5249.04 --> 5254.48]  If you are the kind of person who can spend twelve thousand dollars on a computer
[5255.44 --> 5255.76]  then
[5256.88 --> 5261.36]  Can you like replace the drives yourself and trick it like get it like?
[5262.56 --> 5269.92]  That is a really small overlap people who can afford this kaleidoscope thing and people who want to save a buck on a hard drive
[5270.80 --> 5274.00]  Right there. Okay, so if you buy the terra six terabyte for
[5274.00 --> 5278.80]  It's just a still ridiculous seven thousand six hundred and fourteen pounds
[5279.20 --> 5282.24]  Uh, it's only six terabyte if you wanted to upgrade it to a
[5282.88 --> 5284.56]  24 terabyte
[5284.56 --> 5287.76]  Which is like I mean that's not nothing in hard drives
[5287.76 --> 5292.32]  Yeah, but it's uh, you know, it's not an almost doubling of price
[5293.20 --> 5296.00]  Yeah, yeah, so you could save I think it's like
[5296.00 --> 5300.88]  Six thousand dollars or something by doing that
[5301.68 --> 5304.80]  We saved six thousand dollars on this hard drive upgrade
[5304.80 --> 5308.64]  Yeah, but then we also wasted a bunch of money that we could have just used a Plex server
[5308.64 --> 5310.00]  We wasted a lot of money
[5310.00 --> 5311.44]  Um, anyway
[5312.40 --> 5313.04]  What else you got?
[5313.04 --> 5315.04]  I think we learned we need it for labs
[5315.04 --> 5316.64]  Uh, one of our first tests
[5317.36 --> 5319.36]  thirty thousand dollars in speakers
[5319.36 --> 5320.64]  thirty thousand dollars in uh
[5320.64 --> 5322.40]  A Plex server. Yeah
[5323.12 --> 5325.44]  Oh, that'd be one heck of a Plex server. That would be like
[5327.12 --> 5329.28]  That'd be a spicy Plex server. That'd be sweet
[5329.84 --> 5332.08]  Yeah, you're really far from your mic. That would be sweet
[5333.92 --> 5340.32]  From Marksy and maybe this is a related question if you could have absolute control of any tech company, which would it be?
[5342.40 --> 5348.72]  Man, I don't think any one person should have absolute control of any tech company. I think that's kind of the problem right now
[5348.72 --> 5353.12]  You know what? I'm not even going i'm not even going to go any further
[5353.12 --> 5357.44]  I'm not even going to come up with one that i'd want to be mostly in control of. I think it's like an enormous
[5358.24 --> 5359.84]  One of the problems of our time
[5361.76 --> 5363.76]  I feel like pretty much any of them
[5366.16 --> 5369.12]  I mean the one that I would probably change the most is apple
[5370.16 --> 5374.48]  Really? No, that's not even true. The one i'd probably change the most oh my god, they're all
[5374.48 --> 5377.20]  I feel like if I got control of facebook, I would just close it
[5377.20 --> 5380.88]  No, facebook could absolutely be a force for good
[5382.32 --> 5386.64]  Facebook marketplace keeps so much trash out of the landfill like it's like actually good
[5387.68 --> 5393.60]  Facebook could be an enormous force for good luke. Okay anytime they're not it's because they choose not to be
[5393.92 --> 5399.28]  So yeah, that's fair. So so taking the easy way out of making an improvement would be to close it
[5399.28 --> 5405.36]  But you could make more of an improvement by just making it not evil by making it great. Yeah, cool
[5407.20 --> 5414.72]  From pedro i'm an animator i'd love to know if you guys enjoy animated movies and if you have any favorite ones or ones that had an impact on your life
[5415.20 --> 5417.20]  Yeah, sure. I love animated movies. I
[5418.80 --> 5420.48]  man, I
[5420.48 --> 5424.48]  Once that had a big impact on my life. I mean, I was an adult by the time
[5425.36 --> 5426.88]  Okay, well, oh, okay
[5427.76 --> 5434.40]  What kind of animator are you we're talking 3d animation then I was kind of an adult by the time those started to really be a thing
[5435.12 --> 5441.12]  But to pick an animated that had an impact on my life. Uh, that's tough. That's tough
[5442.16 --> 5444.80]  I like them. I can't really think of one
[5446.00 --> 5450.08]  I mean, I know that land before time had a big impact on like my mom's life
[5450.08 --> 5454.48]  I was kind of young for the symbolism of everything that she was doing but
[5454.96 --> 5460.96]  My parents split up and so one of the things that she gave me was a tree star and the idea was that
[5461.84 --> 5465.28]  Whenever I had my tree star, I'd know she was around or something like that
[5465.60 --> 5467.60]  But and I was like a little kid. I was like
[5467.84 --> 5471.92]  I've got my little little foot stuffy in my and my tree star and i'm like this is cool. It's from my mom
[5472.56 --> 5474.00]  but like
[5474.00 --> 5480.00]  You know the weight of something like that doesn't didn't fully impact hit you when you're yeah, you know four or whatever
[5480.08 --> 5482.56]  Right, I've never been super into like movies and stuff
[5482.96 --> 5483.76]  um
[5483.76 --> 5490.00]  So I think the most impact that an animated movie on me has had is is uh, I don't even know
[5490.00 --> 5493.68]  I think it I think it wasn't called baymax. I think baymax was just a character in it
[5494.80 --> 5496.80]  uh
[5496.88 --> 5498.88]  Big hero 6. Yeah, yeah, okay
[5498.88 --> 5501.76]  It is like when they would fist bump and he would go
[5503.84 --> 5509.92]  Yeah, my girlfriend and I did that for like years so I feel like that would be the biggest impact did it have meaning behind it
[5510.48 --> 5511.68]  No
[5511.92 --> 5518.00]  But it's just like a thing that happened. Yeah, I don't know archer goes bugs life taught me the ways of carl marks
[5519.76 --> 5521.76]  It's amazing that movie got made
[5522.40 --> 5529.28]  There's like man, there's some there's some there's some serious like symbolism in in animated like kids movies
[5530.00 --> 5533.44]  You know one of them one of the most wild ones to me
[5534.08 --> 5536.80]  Is like what is up with wreck it ralph?
[5537.36 --> 5538.64]  right around like it is
[5539.84 --> 5541.84]  clearly about
[5542.16 --> 5543.60]  colonialism and like
[5544.40 --> 5546.64]  Stealing someone's land and somehow
[5547.20 --> 5552.24]  Turning them into the bad guy and i'm kind of sitting here going is nobody going to talk about this
[5553.04 --> 5556.32]  Why is wreck it ralph the bad guy here?
[5557.04 --> 5558.88]  He was literally just chilling
[5560.00 --> 5564.40]  And then you know fix it felix and the nicelanders like even the name
[5564.88 --> 5567.20]  It's like the the civilized people
[5567.76 --> 5573.76]  Come in and like build their crap and he's like hey you shouldn't do that and tears it down like oh i'm sorry
[5573.76 --> 5577.20]  He's the bad guy now i'm sitting here going like huh
[5578.48 --> 5580.40]  It's been a long time since i've seen it. I don't know
[5580.40 --> 5585.92]  Yeah, Conrad mentioned anything from studio ghibli
[5586.48 --> 5587.84]  I really need to watch those
[5588.40 --> 5592.24]  I have yes you do yeah yeah, I do or wait no bugs life
[5592.24 --> 5597.60]  No, not bugs life ants ants is the one that the ways of carl marks where they seize the means of production or whatever
[5598.00 --> 5601.12]  Yeah, no no no not uh not bugs life. I don't remember bugs life at all
[5601.12 --> 5603.92]  I haven't watched that since I was definitely way too young to understand
[5603.92 --> 5610.40]  A question from carl and surprisingly like two or three other people
[5610.40 --> 5614.96]  Uh, what's your guys's favorite laptop or one that like stands out to you of like uh
[5614.96 --> 5618.32]  This was really good for its time or is currently really good
[5619.68 --> 5623.92]  Every laptop I have ever purchased still works
[5624.80 --> 5631.28]  Which is kind of nuts because the first one that I purchased was in 2009 and it literally still functions
[5631.28 --> 5633.28]  Um
[5634.24 --> 5640.08]  My bamboo still works. I think my parents like lost it, but they have it somewhere. They'll find it
[5640.56 --> 5642.56]  um, I I bought this to shiba
[5643.36 --> 5646.16]  Um, that was probably my like favorite individual one
[5646.16 --> 5647.36]  I'm, not gonna remember the model
[5647.36 --> 5650.88]  But it was this like silver and white laptop that had a backlit keyboard
[5651.28 --> 5655.12]  That I really liked because i'd use it in the dark and I could see the keyboard and like
[5655.36 --> 5658.00]  Yes, I don't need to see a desktop keyboard to be able to type on it
[5658.00 --> 5661.52]  But I kind of do on certain laptop keyboards because they have varied layouts, right?
[5662.00 --> 5662.40]  Um
[5663.52 --> 5664.64]  And
[5664.64 --> 5668.48]  Yeah, that laptop's just still chugging it worked for like ever eventually
[5668.96 --> 5672.80]  I don't remember if it was my brother or myself, but one of us put an ssd in it
[5672.80 --> 5677.92]  And that like brought some life back to it at this point. It's literally a laptop from 2009
[5677.92 --> 5681.84]  So there's not so much you can do to it to make it not just like
[5683.04 --> 5685.68]  Borderline useless, but like it can web browse
[5687.76 --> 5690.40]  It can edit a document it can't do either
[5691.84 --> 5698.24]  Super perfectly, but it can do it which is cool. Uh, and like average laptop lifespan
[5698.64 --> 5702.40]  As far as my understanding went when I used to work in retail was like three years
[5702.40 --> 5705.60]  So the fact that i've never had any of them die is pretty cool. I don't know
[5707.28 --> 5710.88]  I don't know if I could choose a favorite. I actually haven't owned a ton of laptops
[5711.44 --> 5713.44]  I guess the one I had in uni was kind of cool
[5714.16 --> 5715.28]  The m5ne
[5717.52 --> 5722.64]  It was one of the only bare bones laptops you could get I was like determined to like piece it together myself
[5723.36 --> 5724.64]  saved a couple bucks
[5724.64 --> 5725.60]  That was all right
[5725.60 --> 5725.92]  Cool
[5727.52 --> 5729.28]  Question here from mystic man
[5729.28 --> 5735.44]  I'm curious if you guys do any daily reading whether it's news sites web comics or anything of that sort
[5736.64 --> 5739.68]  I read news daily. I doom scroll twitter which I shouldn't
[5743.84 --> 5744.80]  That yeah
[5747.52 --> 5751.84]  From nicholas now that you've kind of gone through some of these troubles with the lab
[5751.84 --> 5759.20]  uh, and with lab one and stuff like that is there anything that you would do differently now that you're where you are now in the progress of everything?
[5760.16 --> 5761.28]  Um
[5761.28 --> 5762.16]  Um
[5763.68 --> 5764.16]  Hmm
[5766.32 --> 5766.56]  No
[5766.56 --> 5768.48]  I would have recruited someone
[5769.28 --> 5773.84]  additional internally to help me with hiring because over 10 000 resumes was a lot
[5775.92 --> 5776.24]  Yeah
[5776.24 --> 5781.52]  Joe's been helping me out just for like some transparency, but I brought him in not right away
[5782.08 --> 5782.48]  um
[5782.48 --> 5783.28]  Um
[5783.28 --> 5785.36]  And having someone who would be able to
[5786.48 --> 5787.04]  uh
[5787.04 --> 5790.48]  Potentially even like do interviews and stuff would have been really nice
[5790.48 --> 5792.64]  I don't know if that would have even been possible at the time
[5793.20 --> 5793.60]  I don't know
[5793.60 --> 5794.48]  but yeah
[5794.48 --> 5796.88]  It's been like quite the process because it's just been
[5797.68 --> 5802.72]  so much work because anytime we have a developer position up we just get insane amounts of applications
[5803.12 --> 5805.20]  Which is great like I appreciate it, but it's
[5805.20 --> 5806.16]  It's a whole lot of work
[5806.16 --> 5807.28]  Yeah
[5807.28 --> 5809.28]  Uh
[5809.84 --> 5810.88]  Question from Justin
[5811.36 --> 5814.16]  Do you have any other plans for steam deck videos?
[5814.16 --> 5815.52]  It's another one we've gotten quite a bit
[5815.52 --> 5820.16]  Uh after we didn't do the using it every day for a month because you just gamed the whole time
[5820.16 --> 5827.28]  Um, yeah, we are we're gonna be uploading a video where we hot rod cooled the steam deck
[5827.52 --> 5828.88]  I saw that picture
[5828.88 --> 5832.24]  I pitched this to alex a while back and he's like, I don't think it's gonna work
[5832.88 --> 5833.76]  Spoiler alert
[5834.48 --> 5835.44]  It's awesome
[5836.16 --> 5841.84]  It looks like it wouldn't be uncomfortable too. It's fine, which is cool. It's amazing
[5842.24 --> 5846.80]  Basically, the the whole genesis of that project was a conversation with
[5846.80 --> 5853.68]  Um, the ceo of aya who makes the neo that that competing handheld and I was like hey
[5854.72 --> 5856.72]  noise on these things is a problem and
[5857.36 --> 5859.36]  Cooling is a problem
[5859.36 --> 5862.40]  Uh, here's a solution and it was actually inspired by those
[5863.28 --> 5866.16]  You know those little water cooling kits you can get for phones
[5866.72 --> 5871.68]  Where it's like just a backing you put on it and then you run tubes to like an ice bath or whatever
[5871.68 --> 5874.48]  Just to like cool your phone while you're gaming on it. So your fps doesn't drop
[5875.20 --> 5878.80]  It was inspired by that and I was like, okay, what about that but less stupid?
[5879.12 --> 5886.72]  So you just have uh, because you've got your your die and then you've got usually a heat pipe of some sort running off to your your heat exchanger
[5887.20 --> 5892.48]  Um, what if just on top of that heat pipe you had a spot where you could for sure?
[5892.56 --> 5895.44]  Yeah, where you could just put like a secondary cooling element
[5895.76 --> 5899.92]  That sticks out of the casing and then you could just have a cover for when you're not using it
[5900.48 --> 5905.44]  That'd be flipping awesome, right? And he's like, oh, I don't know manual performance mode
[5905.44 --> 5908.24]  That sounds pretty good. That sounds pretty dumb
[5909.20 --> 5917.76]  It sounds pretty 90s to be completely honest and then I sent him a picture of the result and I told him the results and he was like
[5918.96 --> 5922.64]  We will explore this. That's cool. That's cool. I like that
[5922.88 --> 5927.44]  We did it with the steam deck rather than an Ionio just because the steam deck's layout is
[5928.00 --> 5930.24]  more conducive to a a janky
[5930.88 --> 5937.12]  uh, you know, kind of half-arsed implementation of it. Without ruining like your your hand-holding experience, I guess
[5937.76 --> 5943.52]  But I I would love I would love to see that actually become a thing. Yeah, that's cool
[5943.52 --> 5950.08]  That is pretty much it for questions
[5950.08 --> 5957.12]  Uh, we just get a lot of passionate roku people over the last couple weeks. Uh, hey, sup shout out roku people
[5957.12 --> 5961.36]  There is the thing there is the thing I saw someone ask about rtc batteries on framework laptops
[5961.36 --> 5964.88]  It started some controversy on the forums. I've looked at it now
[5964.88 --> 5969.60]  I see that they are replying to people about what went wrong and what they've changed
[5969.92 --> 5972.32]  So I guess we'll have to just keep an eye on that
[5973.12 --> 5976.72]  But it seems like in terms of transparency. They're doing okay now
[5977.60 --> 5982.56]  I know I say it wrong, but there's the app hydra vion. Apparently it's french for float plane
[5983.92 --> 5985.60]  Hydra vion hydra vion
[5986.08 --> 5988.08]  I'm guessing that makes sense
[5988.56 --> 5990.72]  Avion yeah, that makes sense. Yeah
[5991.44 --> 5994.80]  Hydra vion it's it. Yeah, apparently it works great. I don't know
[5994.80 --> 6000.16]  I've heard very good things about it again. I haven't personally used it. I don't have a roku, but I have heard very good things about it
[6000.16 --> 6002.16]  So yeah, check it out
[6003.28 --> 6005.28]  I'm not saying we won't make one eventually
[6005.28 --> 6007.52]  But I've heard great things. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm done
[6009.36 --> 6011.36]  That is pretty much what I was doing
[6012.88 --> 6018.24]  And I think we're done here. Thanks for tuning into the Wanchill. We will see you again next week same bad time
[6018.80 --> 6020.80]  Same bad channel
[6020.80 --> 6022.80]  Bye
[6024.80 --> 6030.88]  Okay, hold on a second hold on a second stop the intro
[6031.68 --> 6034.08]  Hold on I gotta go back to cam only here
[6034.80 --> 6037.52]  I wasn't trying to pronounce it in french
[6038.16 --> 6042.40]  It was an english pronunciation of the french. I was like hide
[6042.40 --> 6044.40]  I
[6044.40 --> 6046.40]  Yeah, it would be
[6046.40 --> 6049.76]  He drabby or he drabby or something like that. I know it's not hydra vion
[6050.24 --> 6053.52]  Okay, I'm we're trying to kind of help people find it
[6054.08 --> 6058.32]  Um, so we're we're saying it a little bit more english phonetically, you know
[6058.32 --> 6070.32]  Oh, man, you guys want to see something funny? Hold on before we go. Yes, we go something funny
[6070.32 --> 6074.72]  Uh, here's my shared screen people are like, oh, linus ignored youtube chat
[6074.72 --> 6076.96]  Guess what? This is still broken
[6077.76 --> 6082.08]  super chats and members there are literally super chats right here
[6082.96 --> 6089.12]  And mem new members right here and yet they are not under viewer activity. This is why we just don't bother anymore
[6090.64 --> 6092.08]  So dumb
[6092.08 --> 6096.40]  There's a funny moment in the stream where usually when we share screens we share your screen
[6096.48 --> 6101.68]  So there's twitch and float plane chat up and then they like fight something that's been really funny is lately
[6102.32 --> 6105.36]  Twitch chat has just been saying really nice things about float plane chat
[6105.36 --> 6109.60]  So floating chat looks like a bunch of jerks, uh, which I find to be entertaining
[6109.92 --> 6114.16]  Um, but when we shared my screen, I don't have twitch chat up
[6114.16 --> 6119.28]  So it's just float plane chat drawing arrows to themselves saying negative things
[6122.96 --> 6126.08]  So I love you float plane chat, but you kind of got owned
[6129.92 --> 6131.92]  Oh, so
