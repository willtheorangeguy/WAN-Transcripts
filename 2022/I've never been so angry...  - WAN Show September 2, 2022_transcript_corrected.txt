[0.00 → 6.88] what is up you all welcome to the wan show we've got a fantastic show lined up for you this week
[6.88 → 17.28] our main topics of discussion are going to be what is usb4 2.0 I don't even want to know that
[17.28 → 25.90] is not how versioning that's illegal version numbering works and also LTT has actually
[25.90 → 34.02] completed okay it is shot now we have completed our first major like big sponsorship
[34.02 → 42.88] of like an s-tier YouTuber yeah yeah we do sponsorships for other YouTubers now so I'm going
[42.88 → 48.74] to be talking about that what else we got today that's wacky what isn't wacky is dozen 7000
[48.74 → 54.26] and intel trying to say that uh you know arc is better than NVIDIA at ray tracing
[54.26 → 59.30] uh they have never claimed anything in the past that ended up being skewed
[59.30 → 61.74] so I'm sure this is purely accurate
[61.74 → 67.46] so
[67.46 → 71.46] so
[71.46 → 90.62] shows brought to you by Squarespace vulture and secret lab all right I think the first thing we're
[90.62 → 97.92] going to have to dig into this week is um oh the slightly different format for the show I'm really
[97.92 → 103.62] hungry and bell's hungry and Luke was indifferent so we ordered food so we're going to get through our
[103.62 → 109.56] tech topics a little bit faster, and we're gonna save our merch messages for a little bit later in
[109.56 → 115.22] the show so if you guys haven't picked up a screwdriver or backpack or a RGB hoodie or short circuit hoodie
[115.22 → 120.60] like the one I'm wearing or anything else that's on the store, and you wanted to order one now and send
[120.60 → 124.46] in a merch message bell's going to be curating everything throughout the show, but we're going to get to
[124.46 → 129.24] them later we're going to push them a little bit further out which means we are going to jump right
[129.24 → 140.14] into usb4 2.0 that's right ladies and gentlemen the USB uh what is it USB forum USB promoter group
[140.14 → 147.84] can you they have they're on a mission they're on a mission to make me angry because there is no
[147.84 → 156.40] other possible reason that I can imagine for this naming scheme to exist this is not how versioning
[156.40 → 163.78] works I like to think I like to think that someone there knows that and is driving for change but this
[163.78 → 171.80] one time was like actually we need this sequence of numbers, and they made it happen what they wanted
[171.80 → 178.30] 420 what do you even oh my god well then they could have just made it version 4.20
[178.30 → 188.08] and even that would have been stupid because it appears to be a pretty significant upgrade oh yeah
[188.08 → 194.74] from 40 gigabits per second to 80 gigabits per second to be clear I am not upset about the technology
[194.74 → 200.66] it sounds actually like really solid you do need an active cable uh for that 80 gigabit per
[200.66 → 208.18] second it's uh it's max on passive is 40 gigabits, but that's still, still pretty crazy it's only USB type
[208.18 → 217.40] c which is what's going to happen a matter of time yeah matter of time yeah um I'm so angry it includes
[217.40 → 223.26] new features such as a bandwidth boost beyond 20 gigabits per second for USB 3.2 data tunnelling
[223.26 → 227.92] when using alt modes such as DisplayPort mode and has been updated to feature the latest versions of
[227.92 → 234.06] the DisplayPort standard and PCIE spec which remember is important because USB 4 is now
[234.06 → 238.60] essentially thunderbolt which was able to carry PCIE connections that's how you can hook up
[238.60 → 243.92] an external GPU and stuff like that it is backwards compatible with previous revisions including the
[243.92 → 252.44] original USB 4 standard which has barely even made it to life at this point yeah USB 3.2 USB 2.0 and
[252.44 → 260.02] thunderbolt 3 and our discussion question is faster is always better but why do they keep using these
[260.02 → 265.26] confusing naming schemes I might have an answer for that I'm going to have to try to dig it up capes in
[265.26 → 271.64] float plane chat says that the USB spec naming is meant for developers and not consumers and that we
[271.64 → 280.46] should refer to Benson lungs hopefully I said that right response in the USB c hardware USB c hardware
[280.46 → 289.98] Subreddit i legitimately almost said hardware names sorry what hold on a second hold on a second
[289.98 → 295.32] all right Benson I don't like that personally I don't see why developers need a worse naming scheme
[295.32 → 302.70] um I would like to try to find this thread can can someone post I think I've I think I've probably got
[302.70 → 309.82] it USB promoter group announces USB forward this is great that's it is has 163 comments and 48 upvotes
[309.82 → 319.68] that's usually a good sing the top-up oh this is great uh login to different no I don't want to
[319.68 → 326.50] log in I don't care i found the post USB does have branding professionals hint this announcement
[326.50 → 331.96] is about a spec version bump which is a technical document not a branding document here's what my
[331.96 → 338.08] guess is on the branding will be for gear with the new speed USB 4 80 gigabits per second
[338.08 → 361.02] why USB 4 2.0 why not USB 5 why not USB 4.1 why not literally anything else like there is
[361.02 → 371.78] no continuity whatsoever we had USB 1 then we got 1.1 if I recall there was a 1.1a hold on all the
[371.78 → 379.70] versions of USB here we go okay 1.1 okay 1.0 apparently was like never really a thing this is
[379.70 → 386.32] from trip light though so I have no idea how accurate this is you oh my god just show me the table okay so
[386.32 → 393.26] we got here we go here we go trip light provides this uh this chart 1.1 this was full speed USB
[393.26 → 400.16] uh introduced in 1998 all right you had your USB a had your USB b that was for your scanner all
[400.16 → 405.38] right we had scanners back then okay that was a peripheral we had our printers we had our
[405.38 → 413.00] scanners combine them black magic not till later okay then we had USB 2 high speed
[413.00 → 421.42] who would think what would you think is faster high speed or full speed help me out here Luke
[421.42 → 430.44] full speed yeah I would think so too maximum unfortunately full speed is like 140th the
[430.44 → 437.76] speed of high speed yeah okay whatever darn came a mere two years later so yeah it went a lot faster and
[437.76 → 444.62] that merited uh you know a spec bump okay then we went from 480 megabits per second okay so we
[444.62 → 452.18] 6x the excuse me 10x the speed again to 5 gigabits and that was in 2008 whopping eight years later this
[452.18 → 464.58] was USB 3.0 which I think has since been renamed to 3.1 gen 1 super speed okay then things get really
[464.58 → 474.54] messy USB 3.1 doubled the speed over USB 3.0 and was originally called USB 3.1 then it was changed
[474.54 → 486.76] to USB 3.1 gen 2 super speed plus holy f***ING s*** okay then we got USB 3.2 super speed
[486.76 → 495.22] which I think is yes now called USB 3.2 gen 2 by 2 oh no right no, no no these were former names right
[495.22 → 502.92] gen 1 now it's USB 3.2 gen 1 okay 3.2 gen 2 by 2 and that's 20 gigabits per second I really enjoyed
[502.92 → 510.42] that one I remember that launch oh my god then we got USB 4 which was also known as USB 4 gen 2 by
[510.42 → 517.76] 2 or USB 4 20 gigabit wait what 20 gigabit I thought oh, oh my god okay so USB 4 this is where
[517.76 → 523.78] things get really complicated because USB 4 has optional components to the spec you don't have to
[523.78 → 529.64] you can be USB 4 without being 40 gigabits per second so here we've got USB 4 20 gigabits
[529.64 → 537.94] okay so that came in 2019 does up to 20 gigabits then we got USB 4 which is gen 3 by 2 which does 40
[537.94 → 544.48] gigabit and might also do like PCIE and stuff uh assuming you have a compliant cable
[544.48 → 548.68] all of this was preventable
[548.68 → 558.42] there's some uh there are some posts actually in response to tech linked uh so laughing man
[558.42 → 565.84] or Benson lung the person that we're finding comments from and stuff responded to a tech linked
[565.84 → 572.56] Twitter post a tweet some would say um and there are more comments from him on the Reddit thread
[572.56 → 578.64] um there 's's a few different comments on Reddit they're all saying roughly the same thing
[578.64 → 586.48] um where's the other one the main thing is what i kind of already said though on Twitter
[586.48 → 593.64] um someone responded to tech linked by saying Ben Mitchell responded to tech linked by saying oh
[593.64 → 599.70] my god can they just stick to the naming scheme please and stop renaming old standards Benson lung
[599.70 → 605.20] also known as laughing man said no because people and then in brackets developers spec writers and
[605.20 → 610.66] others work on these spec documents these are living standards and having a sensible version numbering
[610.66 → 617.26] scheme is required someone responded to that uh by saying this is not a sensible version numbering
[617.26 → 625.22] scheme uh which got 23 likes he responded um Luke with the play-by-play here all right the likes are
[625.22 → 629.42] the likes are interesting the tech link post got a bunch of likes the first response gets 68
[629.42 → 634.88] Benson responds gets three someone go up by the way can one person go like that 68 one thanks nice
[634.88 → 643.20] yeah perfect um Bryce responds gets 23 Benson responds again gets two so okay that that isn't
[643.20 → 649.16] that doesn't mean he's right or anything it's just, or wrong people aren't happy about it um he says uh
[649.16 → 655.14] it absolutely is in reference to not a sensible uh version numbering scheme he says the USB developers
[655.14 → 664.64] announced the version 1.0 release of the USB 4 spec oh in 2019 sorry I missed that part right um
[664.64 → 670.28] three years have passed, and a new version is about to be released based on the same USB 4 technologies
[670.28 → 674.00] it makes sense to go from version 1.0 to 2.0
[674.00 → 683.02] but if it's the same USB 4 technologies then why the actual living is it not just USB 4.1
[683.02 → 687.04] yep
[687.04 → 693.72] yep you know like how you did it before
[693.72 → 702.98] yep remember that USB promoter group remember when you did that remember when USB 3.0 became USB 3.1
[702.98 → 706.66] because it was based on the same underlying technology but made it go faster and had
[706.66 → 712.36] some new features do you remember that I also don't even mind multiple decimal points have you
[712.36 → 719.42] seen that in some versioning yeah they'll do like major minor micro or whatever I'd rather have a
[719.42 → 725.98] letter at that point personally DisplayPort style um the pro okay DisplayPort has made some mistakes
[725.98 → 733.26] though if I recall correctly oh no, no HTML has done it HTML one point something b was like a huge upgrade
[733.26 → 743.80] from because really okay if it's going to end up facing the consumer you can't just wash your hands of it
[743.80 → 747.86] and go well this is intended for developers it's not my fault that consumers are confused
[747.86 → 754.98] he's saying no he's saying it won't what of course it will he said it always does he said I agree
[754.98 → 762.48] he's he's so I'm just making sure that I say his arguments he's saying that it is it won't and
[762.48 → 767.42] shouldn't uh because there will be official branding and that official branding is USB 4 80 gigabits per
[767.42 → 774.16] second or 80 gigabit the problem is that that's not what's going to end up being presented for sure
[774.16 → 783.06] yep and like meanwhile you've got the HDMI group actively making it harder to tell what is implemented
[783.06 → 791.10] on a product you've got the USB group adding ambiguity layers on top of ambiguity layers okay with optional
[791.10 → 802.18] parts of the specification and no, no no clear actual like line in the sand for what qualifies as USB number point number
[802.18 → 809.72] so someone just said what I was trying to say better it's called semantic versioning, and it goes major minor patch
[809.72 → 817.44] i actually I've never minded that personally sure because you could have like okay so let's use windows
[817.44 → 823.26] who have not done a good job of this but let's use windows let's say we're on Windows 15 so you have
[823.26 → 829.00] Windows 15 that's your first number 15 sure dot, and then you have major version releases well why don't
[829.00 → 836.38] we just use a windows that used this Windows 3.1 yeah yeah yeah so major update is the point one and
[836.38 → 841.58] then any little tiny fixes whatever they can get slammed under at the very bottom decimal point sure no
[841.58 → 845.88] one really cares, but they're there because they matter right but like the average users aren't going to care
[845.88 → 852.52] and that's completely fine that works for I've never really seen anyone complain about that naming
[852.52 → 858.26] scheme I'm not saying it's the best I'm not saying it's the most marketable whatever, but it works it's
[858.26 → 865.78] very what's marketable is what can be understood from my point of view it should describe at least
[865.78 → 873.70] like okay you can criticize intel all day for their opaque processor numbering schemes especially once you
[873.70 → 880.00] make your way out of the like the mainline enthusiast skews into some of the weird low power stuff or some of
[880.00 → 889.06] the embedded stuff that they do but at least every digit has mostly some kind of meaning to it like you
[889.06 → 900.28] could if you had a legend you could interpret it right whereas USB just has no clear it just has no
[900.28 → 908.36] like going from three to four didn't have a speed increase okay it didn't even have an interface
[908.36 → 914.04] change they're both USB c so what was the difference I mean I know the difference there were a lot of
[914.04 → 923.00] technological innovations between USB 3 and USB 4 but then why did you allow this half half-ass
[923.00 → 931.22] implementation that wasn't 40 gigabits per second for USB 4 like i just I'm I'm struggling here I'm
[931.22 → 939.84] struggling as long as it's consistent I can kind of get behind it but any other time it really does
[939.84 → 946.64] feel like you are the worst you are confusing consumers for a reason like you know when um
[946.64 → 954.56] oh man like you'll see you'll see like a GPU maker go from three-digit numbers to four-digit numbers
[954.56 → 959.12] when and you particularly see these things happen when they don't have anything particularly
[959.12 → 966.34] innovative to show yeah there is some people i I have I I want to make sure I'm defending
[966.34 → 971.50] uh Benson lung right now because there are some people saying like oh they like they promised
[971.50 → 978.32] or they said that it would be USB 4 80 gigabits per second they're still saying that, and he's still
[978.32 → 985.64] saying that that's going to be the marketing or branding version um this weird one that i already
[985.64 → 993.36] forgot USB 4 version 2.0 is a theoretically a developer only branding thing the problem with this
[993.36 → 1000.76] is it's not only has it already hit a lot of consumers yeahs, but it's going to hit many more and
[1000.76 → 1008.66] will very likely be a part of the branding of certain products um so because companies are
[1008.66 → 1017.24] going to start designing developing planning these products like now um, and they're just not going
[1017.24 → 1022.74] to get updated we've seen it happen a ton of times so yeah I'm really frustrated let's move on though
[1022.74 → 1029.90] that's just enough being angry uh do you want to talk about Japan declaring war on floppy disks or
[1029.90 → 1034.24] one this is actually pretty interesting uh Japan declares war on floppy disks Japan's digital
[1034.24 → 1040.58] minister taro Kong has declared war on floppy disks and other retro tech used by the country's
[1040.58 → 1048.18] bureaucrats Japan still has roughly 1900 government procedures that require the use of disks including
[1048.18 → 1055.08] floppy disks CDs and this is the best mini disk I was very surprised to see mini disks on here
[1055.08 → 1061.22] I know right kind of awesome um the U.S. government uh had been using floppy disks as recently as
[1061.22 → 1070.20] 2019 to receive nuclear launch orders from the president that is awesome to be clear I'm not
[1070.20 → 1077.92] suggesting you know that it's on the internet like I'm just saying we could do something a little more
[1077.92 → 1084.50] robust than floppy disk gets that's okay I just want to make that very clear yeah um more than 20 000
[1084.50 → 1088.74] typical disks would be needed to replicate an average memory stick storing 32 gigabytes of
[1088.74 → 1095.48] information this is pretty epic you guys did a video fairly recently yeah uh building like a Windows 98
[1095.48 → 1103.48] machine we bought it oh you bought yeah there's a vendor online that sells Windows 98 computers for
[1103.48 → 1111.28] like a grand yeah yeah, and they have like new manufactured hardware and stuff no oh I thought they did no they
[1111.28 → 1117.32] just well they might have some but a lot of it is refurbished that makes sense yeah because there's a lot of it
[1117.32 → 1123.14] out there, and it costs nothing but what costs is spending the time to validate it and make sure that it's all
[1123.14 → 1129.52] working and ready for deployment because there as Anthony explained in the video there are many industries
[1129.52 → 1137.06] industries that still rely on ancient software tons of manufacturing and stuff where like it does
[1137.06 → 1141.78] as much as this might annoy some people in like software development and stuff what they have does
[1141.78 → 1148.48] enough in a lot of these situations 300 megahertz a lot of that's millions of cycles a second like it's
[1148.48 → 1154.70] actually fine in a lot of very specific situations you know running a conveyor belt yeah like who cares
[1154.70 → 1164.30] yeah it's fine yep and the cost of updating that hardware that it's running is monumental it could
[1164.30 → 1171.92] be could potentially be catastrophic depending on the size of the business like so compared to you know
[1171.92 → 1178.26] updating this giant kind of machine or whatever it is you know just going out and buying
[1178.26 → 1186.68] another Windows 98 computer even if you are being charged an obscene amount of money for it sure makes
[1186.68 → 1192.10] it's an obscene amount of money for what you're getting, but it's still a grand which to individuals
[1192.10 → 1196.38] is going to seem like a lot to a company that's churning out millions of dollars worth of product
[1196.38 → 1202.66] every day, and they need that freaking machine running isn't going to be a huge expense it is amazing
[1202.66 → 1210.64] how different the calculations for the worthwhileness of a purchase are for a business compared to a consumer
[1210.64 → 1214.64] see I was even talking about okay what if you're a smaller business, and you just can't afford to update
[1214.64 → 1218.66] the machinery that's one way of thinking about it but then Luke's like well what if they're
[1218.66 → 1222.62] churning out millions of dollars worth of equipment well then they're clearly not starving for money
[1222.62 → 1228.82] but let's talk about opportunity cost yeah what if they had to turn off that machinery for some period
[1228.82 → 1234.98] of time in order to perform this maintenance to upgrade it so that it can run Windows vista or so
[1234.98 → 1241.04] it can run Windows 10 or whatever the case may be what is it costing them to have that not running
[1241.04 → 1247.74] so it could be literally it could be hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to turn it off and
[1247.74 → 1254.26] upgrade it versus what I just spend a grand and I can go get a new Windows 98 computer it's wild right
[1254.26 → 1263.56] and so as much as it feels counterintuitive for you know as an as a 80s 90s kid right I feel like
[1263.56 → 1270.34] Japan is like the land of technology yeah yeah that's that's the kind of the brand that Japan has
[1270.34 → 1276.82] to me right you know the first time that I ever saw an USB thumb drive it was a friend
[1276.82 → 1282.08] bringing it back I believe from a trip to Japan yeah or the first time I saw a minidisc oh it's its
[1282.08 → 1288.70] Sony you know Sony was like the premium right Samsung and LG were still like
[1288.70 → 1294.00] lucky gold star like cheap crap right nobody respected those brands back then like
[1294.00 → 1302.86] Japan the land of video games and technology and like so for me to read that the Japanese government
[1302.86 → 1309.98] is still using flop I mean CDs oh okay fair enough I guess but minidisc
[1309.98 → 1318.68] minidisc was never even you like i I wasn't even aware of it as as a medium for anything other
[1318.68 → 1325.56] than you know listening to mp3s off Napster right like I don't know i that was the only thing i ever
[1325.56 → 1331.06] knew it to exist for, and it was also very common back then for certain I mean it still is
[1331.06 → 1335.28] common but not on the same scale I would argue because the internet has connected people very closely
[1335.28 → 1339.54] but it was very common back then for certain technologies to actually take off in certain areas
[1339.54 → 1345.88] so maybe minidisc was just used for other stuff in Japan I mean it was sick it was cool right
[1345.88 → 1351.70] compared to the other things we had at the time you got to understand USB thumb drives not a thing yet
[1351.70 → 1357.40] okay and even though and even when they were a thing they weren't necessarily convenient like
[1357.40 → 1361.18] uh if you went to a library or something like that it's not like it would support
[1361.18 → 1366.54] plugging in your USB drive and I'm talking like the library at school like you would have to you would
[1366.54 → 1373.34] have to carry sometimes a floppy diskette with USB drivers on it and then the USB drive that had
[1373.34 → 1377.82] your like your PowerPoint presentation, or you know something some kind of multimedia thing that
[1377.82 → 1382.76] wouldn't fit on a floppy disk even once I had an USB drive I would often still use floppy disks
[1382.76 → 1388.22] not in small part because my first USB thumb drive was either 8 megabytes or 16 megabytes like it
[1388.22 → 1395.10] actually didn't have that much more capacity people thought it was weird too um jacks in flow plane
[1395.10 → 1400.96] chat said minidisc was much more popular in Japan I mean yeah i guess I get it because
[1400.96 → 1407.18] the capacity compared to the things we had at the time was massive apparently you can copy rented
[1407.18 → 1415.34] music in Japan and that was a big push for minidiscs oh interesting okay
[1415.34 → 1423.18] I mean Japan has all kinds of stuff that I just like never even saw or never heard of before
[1423.18 → 1426.78] yeah like the kinds of stuff you can get in vending machines over there and stuff
[1426.78 → 1432.88] unfortunately the one time we went to Japan we didn't really get a chance to stay very short
[1432.88 → 1437.44] period of time, and it was awesome for that really short period of time, but it was awesome
[1437.44 → 1448.34] yeah anyway um so that's hilarious I guess it's finally time for floppy disks to uh to head out
[1448.34 → 1454.42] right out into the sunset i I shouldn't be that surprised I mean I remember being I remember
[1454.42 → 1460.68] feeling this exact same emotion like you ever get that where it's like a déjà vu kind of feeling
[1460.68 → 1466.54] but you don't actually feel like this thing happened before, but you feel like you've had this you've
[1466.54 → 1472.62] experienced this feeling before the day I found out that one of our major competitors at NCI still
[1472.62 → 1478.44] submitted their PO's via fax I'm sitting here going what you can't, you can't walk into the warehouse and
[1478.44 → 1484.96] grab a computer you can't send an f***ING email like what do you what do you mean you why would you
[1484.96 → 1490.28] submit them via fax that one i genuinely you would actually you would actually send your rep an email
[1490.28 → 1497.16] to say hey check your fax machine yeah it's like that's like leaving you voicemail to ask if you've
[1497.16 → 1503.24] checked your text messages like what are you what are you doing yeah I can't fathom if it's very
[1503.24 → 1508.78] weird it's very, very weird i it does make me a little bit sad and I know this probably just like
[1508.78 → 1517.92] makes me old but i always really liked the physical nature of things sure like there 's's an
[1517.92 → 1523.32] anamorphic book oof that might be dating me as well um, but there's an anamorphic book where they have
[1523.32 → 1529.20] these like data cubes sure like even Star Wars has the whatever they're called the pyramid
[1529.20 → 1536.04] things that have knowledge yeah for sure uh holocrons yeah these like physical mediums of
[1536.04 → 1540.80] information just because I know that doesn't mean Star Wars isn't dead to me carry on we're always i
[1540.80 → 1544.30] always thought they were really cool I thought it was cool that i that's one of the reasons why i
[1544.30 → 1552.30] like physical games as well I've always really enjoyed physical media um, and it is like better sure
[1552.30 → 1560.76] that things are becoming more digital and and and whatnot but I do find it more boring so I think
[1560.76 → 1567.28] it's like kind of cool in a not good way I guess maybe that some of these things still run on this
[1567.28 → 1571.56] old hardware and run on these old systems and stuff like that I think yeah I think it's kind of neat
[1571.56 → 1579.58] chats super into anamorphic okay which anamorphic were you which anamorphic was I yeah I only remember one of
[1579.58 → 1585.24] them so I guess I'll just go with that sure i I only remember Tobias's name i I read it i probably
[1585.24 → 1590.94] read like 40 50 of them like I was super into anamorphic Marco and tobias is like the bird
[1590.94 → 1596.74] whose mom is the i I never know I knew how to pronounce it Turks I don't I don't know how to
[1596.74 → 1602.32] is that the aliens yeah the slugs yeah um yeah she was controlled and wasn't his like brother or is
[1602.32 → 1607.30] that Tobias's brother I don't I don't know maybe I didn't make it that far I know Marco's mom is
[1607.30 → 1612.54] like viscera one or something like that and I don't remember any of the other characters and i
[1612.54 → 1617.94] only know Marco because you mentioned it yeah it's been a long time I don't remember hawk yeah I think
[1617.94 → 1623.06] Tobias is the hawk, and he's stuck as a hawk and then I think he gets unstuck later he wanted to be
[1623.06 → 1628.84] though I think I don't remember I remember something about him having an option to become unstuck and he
[1628.84 → 1633.36] was like forget it I'm a hawk now yeah something like that yeah that that rings a bell I think I did make
[1633.36 → 1640.26] it that far people like spoilers okay, okay these books came out like 20 years ago I think
[1640.26 → 1646.76] I think we're clean and clear on spoiler warnings yeah yeah can't remember the andante's name man
[1646.76 → 1654.22] hold on okay andante's name no I got nothing because like one joins them later or something
[1654.22 → 1661.74] and it's like it's like it's like when the that TV show adds that like dumb extra character like I don't
[1661.74 → 1666.30] remember him really serving any purpose other than just be like oh cool we have an alien sidekick now
[1666.30 → 1674.16] I think axe that's the one nighttime that that was the name, and he was like the son of the one that
[1674.16 → 1681.20] gave them the powers in the first place or something I don't know man ani morphs man I bet my daughters
[1681.20 → 1687.74] would love ani morphs I don't know I think I still have a bunch of the books i I tend to keep my books but
[1687.74 → 1695.26] yeah I think I still have those animal ESR oh my goodness what a name yeah I think we'll just
[1695.26 → 1701.14] call you axe yeah yeah that's probably a good idea 100 all right uh what were we talking about again
[1701.14 → 1707.08] uh Japan declaring war on floppy disks yeah physical media man books are I like physical media books are a
[1707.08 → 1712.68] tough one for me because on the one hand i they're very unreasonable in the modern day yeah they don't
[1712.68 → 1719.30] make any sense yeah but the flip side of it is I've been on vacation this week I've been on vacation
[1719.30 → 1725.12] this week and I was like man I haven't read a book in forever because it's its it's tough for me, I get
[1725.12 → 1732.36] sucked in and then I don't I'm not functional right like i i I love to read it's not that I don't love it
[1732.36 → 1737.58] i just i I can, I don't have the discipline for if it's like it's like Anna for me, it's like I could be
[1737.58 → 1743.82] sitting there for literally eight consecutive hours doing nothing but like not even stopping to
[1743.82 → 1750.52] eat just like reading right and um so I was like oh I'm on vacation I'm going to read a book
[1750.52 → 1759.88] and i just I have kindle unlimited but I just did not gravitate toward the Kindle at all
[1759.88 → 1767.84] not even a tiny bit I was like I will go look at my library of dead trees and I don't know why
[1767.84 → 1772.50] it doesn't make any sense I don't want to fill my house with books they're stupid they're heavy
[1772.50 → 1780.24] they take up space they're hard to find obviously just having one slate where all the words can
[1780.24 → 1787.54] just appear is it's objectively better yep, but it's subjectively and like to man the book I settled on
[1787.54 → 1794.30] it's called um, um Mr Morrell and Jonathan strange it was actually given to me by Tyler before he
[1794.30 → 1800.18] passed well not given borrowed lent to me but I wouldn't obviously my favourite books of all time
[1800.18 → 1804.22] are recommended from him yeah so uh that was why that was why I wanted to read it because it was
[1804.22 → 1811.24] kind of the last uh the last book recommendation he gave me and i kind of haven't uh i haven't
[1811.24 → 1816.60] been able to yet but I am so I'm anyway I'm about a quarter of the way through, and it's like thick
[1816.60 → 1822.24] it's like this thick right that's really inconvenient to hold like it sucks it's heavy it's stupid
[1822.24 → 1829.42] but the experience is good okay we need to do a float plane pull okay physical books versus
[1829.42 → 1835.40] digital books I'm on it honestly i I think it could be settled for me if digital books were way cheaper
[1835.40 → 1841.22] but the fact that physical books even with shipping are often cheaper than a digital copy is just
[1841.22 → 1846.16] outrageous to me because I don't believe for a second that the author is getting way more royalties
[1846.16 → 1855.56] yeah I doubt it I do not believe that I like I enjoy audiobooks because we've talked about for a
[1855.56 → 1860.88] long time I have like issues reading scripts and stuff I'm I'm mildly dyslexic so I read really
[1860.88 → 1867.58] slowly and I have a hard time reading so i I enjoy audiobooks and I listen to audiobooks for things that i
[1867.58 → 1874.36] feel like I need to get through like oh this book is on a topic I feel like I should have this information
[1874.36 → 1879.34] for whatever reason I want to learn something I want to grow in some way whatever so I'll listen
[1879.34 → 1886.26] to an audiobook to make sure that I get all of that but I enjoy reading physical books so especially if
[1886.26 → 1891.04] it's like some like fantasy novel or something like that I'll usually read it physically it takes
[1891.04 → 1897.76] me forever, but it doesn't matter so who cares see even with a tech audience overwhelmingly like 67
[1897.76 → 1904.82] 67 two-thirds of float planchette there's something about tactile it feels good and that's like
[1904.82 → 1910.28] putting in a floppy when's the last time you did it the noises remember the noises it's great
[1910.28 → 1915.42] yeah I know it is like i just I don't know it's time to play a game
[1915.42 → 1921.62] yeah like you hear it spinning up you strap the headphones on like you feel it's much more of
[1921.62 → 1926.74] like a full experience so are you going to get into vinyl because that's what like everyone in the
[1926.74 → 1930.88] office you're getting into vinyl I'm the first person in the office that got into vinyl they don't know
[1930.88 → 1939.18] that but I wasn't invited to the cool kids club what the heck okay that's one that I can't, I can't
[1939.18 → 1947.90] the second the second I learned about the existence of Napster like the piles of CDs that
[1947.90 → 1953.16] I owned were okay I shouldn't say the second I learned about Napster because it took a little
[1953.16 → 1959.04] while um like you would have to the only way that I could listen to any to mp3s I downloaded was sitting
[1959.04 → 1963.58] at the computer like on our computer speakers because we didn't even have headphones and I had our
[1963.58 → 1970.70] computer that wasn't a thing yet so um I did continue to use CDs and my disc man for a couple
[1970.70 → 1982.48] more years but by the time you could burn a CD of mp3s um I did that a handful of times, but you had to
[1982.48 → 1988.82] have a compatible CD player it had to be able to read data discs yeah and then shortly after that I got
[1988.82 → 1995.96] a RCA lira which was a 64 megabyte mp3 player and that was it that was the last time I gave two
[1995.96 → 2006.30] about any kind of physical media songs and then uh I did pirate music for a long time and then along
[2006.30 → 2013.16] came music subscription services i now happily pay for actually I think I have two subscription services
[2013.16 → 2018.20] I should unsubscribe from Apple Music uh but anyway I happily pay my subscription I don't pirate any music
[2018.20 → 2023.12] any more yeah I have YouTube music yeah um and YouTube music's cool because if you buy a song on iTunes
[2023.12 → 2027.64] you can just take that file, and you can just upload it to it our Google play music had that
[2027.64 → 2031.40] actually your local songs I don't know if YouTube music I think it still does it still do it anyway
[2031.40 → 2042.00] so all my songs are totally legit now but I just man I cannot even begin to imagine I having like
[2042.00 → 2049.14] I think they're cool I really enjoy the look of it um I never had them when I was
[2049.14 → 2054.56] younger like my dad had some but I don't think we actually like had a record player set up he actually
[2054.56 → 2059.98] has some really wicked ones but I don't think we had a record player set up um I have some really
[2059.98 → 2066.92] cool ones like i I have the vinyls for divinity original sin 2 got to have them signed by like the
[2066.92 → 2070.14] development team who I met in person and like all this kind of stuff so it's like really cool
[2070.14 → 2075.98] the actual record isn't signed to the like sleeve is signed to be clear um and I used to use
[2075.98 → 2080.48] them for like timers basically because that was the thing that annoyed me the most is they're kind
[2080.48 → 2086.98] of short like they end really quickly, and then you have to go to the thing and flip it or
[2086.98 → 2091.78] change which one you have or whatever to be able to keep listening to stuff that's my biggest gripe
[2091.78 → 2096.40] but in order to solve that i yeah I would use it as a timer so I'll be like oh I'll clean this area
[2096.40 → 2103.20] for this long or I'll work out for this amount of time or I'll do whatever um yeah gremlin injector
[2103.20 → 2108.70] asks why I prefer those over Spotify I subscribed to google play music because it comes with YouTube
[2108.70 → 2116.52] premium and YouTube premium matters a lot to me um as for why I prefer it i I hate YouTube music
[2116.52 → 2121.14] it's terrible but google play music was so much better they dragged me kicking and screaming away
[2121.14 → 2127.44] from the Google play music app because the integration with Sonos was flawless it was so
[2127.44 → 2133.86] much better than Spotify's integration with Sonos than anything's integration with DTS play it was
[2133.86 → 2143.18] as seamless as just pressing cast i never for the for years I couldn't figure out why anybody ever
[2143.18 → 2149.60] even opened the Sonos app other than just adding their speakers to their system I didn't even need the
[2149.60 → 2154.04] Sonos app anymore I would just open up the Google play music app and I'd go zone zone zone volume
[2154.04 → 2161.40] sliders cast one button to cast if it's never so stupid the way it works in the Spotify app you have
[2161.40 → 2170.02] to like you have to like create different like groups in the is what DTS play actually I haven't I
[2170.02 → 2176.16] don't know if I've tried the Sonos one anyway it's not as seamless I need google and Sonos to bury the
[2176.16 → 2181.60] hatchet which I've given up ever happening but I need them to bury the hatchet and just bring back
[2181.60 → 2188.82] the Google play music Sonos casting experience because it was the best i I liked google play music
[2188.82 → 2194.52] a lot I hate YouTube I'm not trying to like bandwagon but yeah it's worse YouTube music is way worse
[2194.52 → 2200.14] but yeah it's not worth another entire subscription to me to get Spotify and there's no way I'm not going
[2200.14 → 2204.62] to have YouTube premium because I watch a pretty considerable amount of YouTube and I don't want to watch
[2204.62 → 2213.22] ads so yeah YouTube premium it is for me yeah also the family plan for uh for Google
[2213.22 → 2220.02] google play music uh for YouTube music which is stupid branding stupid what does music have to do
[2220.02 → 2227.32] with YouTube nothing yeah there are music videos on YouTube I get it but oh Conrad just said okay
[2227.32 → 2231.64] YouTube music sucks because if you shuffle a playlist it shuffles the exact same way every time
[2231.64 → 2240.74] it's true I know why who wants that no one wants me to know i I can't, I can't imagine a single
[2240.74 → 2245.58] person is like I'm going to enable this thing that should make things random but if it changes
[2245.58 → 2255.42] I'm upset there's no way that person exists like well come on I mean nope okay I mean yeah they
[2255.42 → 2259.48] probably do like, but there's no way they're not outnumbered by everyone else who would want it to
[2259.48 → 2265.66] actually be random that's fair oh it's so annoying i I have that problem literally right now
[2265.66 → 2271.94] and i I actually like tested it a bunch of times because like there's no way that's how it actually
[2271.94 → 2277.76] works so i I made a really, really short playlist of I think it was like four songs or something just
[2277.76 → 2290.90] to like check and yeah it does the same order as come on yeah i I just want to google play music back
[2290.90 → 2295.16] that's all I want yeah you know what else I want to talk about our sponsors

[2343.26 → 2345.42] that they work on USB specs and naming
[2345.42 → 2353.28] no because it's not exactly the same those guys do shuffle it every time
[2353.28 → 2361.04] oh that's funny like i I don't know at this point I think Microsoft is just taking
[2361.04 → 2367.10] with Xbox naming like i that's pretty clear to me, they're they are they're absolutely Memling on us
[2367.10 → 2374.78] but I do actually believe that the USB promoter group just unironically has no idea why it's so bad

[2466.78 → 2474.54] we sponsored okay, okay to be clear it's not actually unheard of for us to sponsor other
[2474.54 → 2480.10] YouTubers we've sponsored UFD tech I know about that yeah he did that like cannonball run thing
[2480.10 → 2485.16] he's done a few things sponsored that yeah yeah we've done I mean it's its usually when he's doing
[2485.16 → 2491.06] something that's like you know helping raise funds or like yeah, yeah so what we like to we like to chip
[2491.06 → 2496.08] into that kind of thing Brett's been an amazing supporter for us uh over the years yeah so we're
[2496.08 → 2503.18] happy to give something back um we've also worked with Quinn from snazzy labs yep but
[2503.18 → 2513.24] no offence to Brett or Quinn uh this will be by far the biggest sponsorship that we have ever done okay
[2513.24 → 2521.56] so I won't give too many details not going to give too many details I will say that we wrote a fairly
[2521.56 → 2529.36] substantial check um more than we've ever written for our sponsorship before I will say that it is for
[2529.36 → 2535.54] the screwdriver so and Paul it's a're gonna you're going to make a blonde cap
[2535.54 → 2540.58] I guess I'm wrong I tried I shot my shot
[2540.58 → 2554.56] okay, okay keep going uh anyway so it's for the screwdriver which as you guys probably know we
[2554.56 → 2562.04] just launched in four variants all black including a black shaft all black with a silver shaft uh black
[2562.04 → 2566.70] and orange with a black shaft and black and orange with a silver shaft all four variants are still
[2566.70 → 2575.32] available um and that is pretty much all I'm going to say about it other than that we sponsored this
[2575.32 → 2576.94] person to build a pc
[2576.94 → 2587.74] with our screwdriver obviously and I want to let people guess at all um if I told you the theme you'd
[2587.74 → 2592.18] know who it was okay here i can I'll tell you the theme I'll tell you that the actually
[2592.18 → 2599.54] here's what we're going to do let's play a little game okay Luke is going to guess
[2599.54 → 2609.16] five YouTubers like verbally yeah after each one that Luke guesses I will give some kind of hint
[2609.16 → 2615.18] might be helpful might be not that helpful but I will respond in some way to help guide Luke's guesses
[2615.18 → 2622.72] then we're going to put all five of Luke's guesses in a poll so that you guys can say who you think it is
[2622.72 → 2624.06] and this is a tech
[2624.06 → 2626.14] a tech YouTuber
[2626.14 → 2632.76] uh well I don't know you could guess someone and then maybe that would be something that I would tell you as a hint
[2632.76 → 2634.30] okay Marquez
[2634.30 → 2635.52] Marquez
[2635.52 → 2639.34] or MHD more specifically he's hiring on more people I should refer to the brand
[2639.34 → 2644.14] that's actually yeah that's that's a that's a good way of thinking about it okay let me come up
[2644.14 → 2651.26] with something that I could help to uh help to uh guide you some way that I could guide you
[2651.26 → 2656.38] um this person doesn't normally build computers
[2656.38 → 2664.64] Marquez doesn't normally build computers um okay yeah, but you can that does help though
[2664.64 → 2669.60] yes exactly um jerry rig everything
[2669.60 → 2676.76] okay uh I'll, I'll give you there's been some collaboration there before I'll give you something
[2676.76 → 2687.44] else this person is male okay uh okay so you're okay so you're giving me something about that person
[2687.44 → 2693.92] that is accurate so I might be able to get a country confirmation so I'm going to say tom Scott
[2693.92 → 2700.88] this was suggested by flow plane chat but I think it's good tom Scott yeah okay uh this person
[2702.56 → 2710.16] has been making videos for over five years okay, okay okay darn it I wanted the country good one
[2710.16 → 2720.56] though I respect it um ah darn um for those guessing mark Robert uh no, but we are working with mark
[2720.56 → 2723.12] Robert so that's going to be a fun one that's cool that's cool
[2729.20 → 2735.28] interesting it could be I'm kind of like I'm like already out um, but there 's's some good
[2735.28 → 2740.56] suggestions yeah yeah there are lots of different suggestions so I think I'm going to go with one
[2740.56 → 2746.64] of them uh where did it go adam savage he's been making YouTube okay so by based on his
[2746.64 → 2752.64] face that was wrong uh but no, no no, no I had already I had already read it in the chat I'm just I'm just
[2752.64 → 2758.56] interacting I'm being an active listener yeah yeah uh what I'm really trying to think of is like what i
[2758.56 → 2769.84] can say yeah yeah yeah um this person I would say is pretty physically adept
[2772.80 → 2774.16] brings me back to Marquez
[2774.16 → 2776.72] um
[2784.72 → 2790.72] no it's not Dennis I would never sponsor Dennis I'm too angry with Dennis I need help I will
[2790.72 → 2794.80] be fighting Dennis literally when is that happening by the way I don't know oh
[2795.60 → 2800.00] not sure I'll be ready no matter what though I want to like showcase I'm not even worried
[2800.00 → 2801.92] um
[2804.08 → 2810.64] oh guys I think earlier he let it he let it slip that it was a tech it was someone in tech
[2814.00 → 2819.44] oh that could be it that's interesting is he though I don't know I don't watch a lot of
[2820.80 → 2827.76] oh come on Luke hack smith all right that's your five yeah so let's go ahead I put those in the
[2827.76 → 2830.88] doc I don't know how the polling system works do you mind throwing that oh you want those in yeah
[2830.88 → 2835.12] so we're going to let you guys we're going to let you guys guess really easy, but it's like
[2836.40 → 2839.84] okay do we want to do we want to add any more because there are some that people
[2840.64 → 2845.52] suggested a lot sure okay I saw unbox therapy in there a lot of times
[2845.52 → 2849.28] yeah um I saw electro who's the boss
[2852.88 → 2859.68] so who's the boss okay so we'll, we'll add a few more for you guys we'll add a few more for you
[2859.68 → 2865.92] guys that actually do meet the criteria like obviously gamers nexus like not gonna
[2865.92 → 2872.16] be it like they do build computers yeah sort of actually do computers not really they build test
[2872.16 → 2876.80] benches anyway that's a computer yeah sure that's a computer um
[2879.04 → 2882.64] all right yeah sure lets uh let's go with let's go with that
[2885.52 → 2888.00] no DIY perks builds computers all the time come on guys
[2888.80 → 2896.16] come on guys that's like DIY perks this thing weird computers i every single time I watch a video
[2896.16 → 2900.96] by him, I'm like this is this has got to be the end there's no way he thinks of something
[2902.08 → 2908.32] I know more crazy than this and then every single time he releases another video and I'm like how do
[2908.32 → 2915.52] you do this he released one on a lens recently that is just amazing yep like he made his own oh man just
[2915.52 → 2923.04] what a wild guy's wild what a wild guy okay so let's go let's go with that list here's what I'll say
[2923.04 → 2927.60] okay the correct answer
[2929.92 → 2935.12] is in the list or not in the list can you do that should i not let's see
[2936.88 → 2941.76] don't like let's have let's have let's have some fun with you guys don't like you know
[2941.76 → 2943.60] oh here's actually oh here's a good one
[2946.56 → 2954.40] okay now that I have this particular list I think I'm comfortable saying
[2955.92 → 2960.80] actually I'm going to add this okay there you got all those are we able to do a poll with that many options
[2962.00 → 2964.64] okay I mean it's currently letting me okay hold on one more
[2964.64 → 2972.56] okay, okay I saw the one suggested too yeah yep okay we've got we've got I think the main ones that
[2972.56 → 2980.48] people were suggesting yeah and I think i oh wait no, no one more let's put this in their oh very cool
[2980.48 → 2989.52] okay the correct answer is in the list okay I will say I will say that yeah so guys the poll's going up are
[2989.52 → 2996.32] you ready to post the poll yep so I want to know who you guys think we sponsored to do a build with
[2996.32 → 3001.04] the LTT screwdriver just wanted to make sure we got the spelling or something right, but we did
[3001.04 → 3009.44] it's posting now okay here it comes the options are in no particular order uh let's go with the order
[3009.44 → 3017.36] that um uh no particular order jerry rig everything Adam savage i Justine slo-mo guys smarter every day
[3017.36 → 3028.08] Henry Cavill MHD tom Scott hack smith unbox therapy so I'm going to let you guys vote for a little bit
[3028.08 → 3035.36] why don't we talk through dozen 7000 the big news this week obviously in the tech space is dozen 7000
[3035.36 → 3045.20] AMD dropped absolute knowledge bomb after knowledge bomb about their upcoming plans uh the dozen 9 79 50x is
[3045.20 → 3050.00] actually getting a price drop or rather you could consider it a price correction compared to 5000
[3050.00 → 3059.36] series it's still 16 cores 32 threads but can hit a whopping 230 watts when needed and can turbo up to
[3059.36 → 3070.64] 5.7 gigahertz 5.7 80 legs of cash on board and is rated to run with ddr5 5200 memory however AMD has
[3070.64 → 3076.32] already come out and said that their new expo extended profiles for overclocking
[3077.52 → 3085.04] ddr5 memory kits um will be available and the sweet spot for dozen 7000 is going to be
[3085.04 → 3087.52] 6 000 mega transfers per second
[3089.44 → 3095.12] um ooh there are some discussion questions in here from whoever prepared this topic for us
[3095.12 → 3101.12] the 79 50x being 100 cheaper than last gen could that mean that they're reserving the 800 slot for
[3101.12 → 3109.12] a x3d part that is possible although I wouldn't expect it to come anytime soon the 7700x is 100 more
[3109.12 → 3114.80] than last gen, but that part came out over a year into the rollout so that kind of makes sense so could
[3114.80 → 3123.52] be that the 7700x is actually the 5800x replacement it's eight core 16 threads maximum boost of 5.4 gigahertz
[3123.52 → 3129.44] I love these boost clocks holy crap are we ever getting close yeah I mean AMD um dozen
[3131.20 → 3138.56] it's not a bad thing um but dozen generation after generation has been kind of an overclocking dud
[3138.56 → 3143.44] as far as like overclocking on an air cooler or an ambient water cooler obviously the liquid nitrogen
[3143.44 → 3149.28] folks are doing what they do with it right but uh for the mere mortals among us, it doesn't really
[3149.28 → 3155.60] overclock much which is another way of saying that AMD has really optimized it to run at the
[3155.60 → 3162.24] maximum attainable speed for consumers out of the box yeah um, but they are getting like
[3162.88 → 3167.68] shockingly close to that six gigahertz barrier that's just like other topics we've had today is
[3168.40 → 3176.64] boring but good AMD claims that the 79 50x their top tier chip is 11 faster overall in gaming compared
[3176.64 → 3185.28] to the 12 900k and that even the dozen 5 70 600x which is 300 beats the 12 900k in gaming while also
[3185.28 → 3193.68] costing a lot less how competitive will dozen 7000b with raptor lake asks our discussion question uh
[3193.68 → 3201.92] especially because raptor lake is rumoured to be more expensive than alder lake 12th gen uh wow
[3201.92 → 3207.76] Canadian retailers listing 13th gen Intel Core processors with prices 15 to 19 percent higher
[3207.76 → 3208.96] than alder lake counterparts
[3211.36 → 3217.12] with that said I know from my experience in retail that sometimes what we would do is we would put in
[3217.12 → 3223.36] placeholder prices before we actually got formal pricing that was just definitely higher than what
[3223.36 → 3228.00] it would be so that way we could have the listings up we could prepare our pages and everything
[3228.00 → 3234.24] no almost nobody would actually order at those prices um because and the products not even out
[3234.24 → 3239.04] yet it's not shipping or anything but what it would mean is that you could get everything prepared and
[3239.04 → 3245.92] you definitely wouldn't lose money if people ordered it early so it could be that this is not actually that
[3246.72 → 3247.28] meaningful
[3250.96 → 3257.44] either way it could be it could mean that the competition between raptor lake and dozen 7000 is going
[3257.44 → 3264.24] to be a little tighter than uh the initial rumours might have indicated I'm I'm excited oh no we
[3264.24 → 3269.04] forgot to type in Mr who's the boss yeah that's my bad well I guess we've ruled out um it's true the
[3269.04 → 3277.12] boss sorry um what do you think the sweet spot is what do you think the the the mover is going to be oh i
[3277.12 → 3285.84] think it's absolutely going to be uh 7700x yeah at 400 bucks for eight core 16 thread 5.4 gigahertz boost
[3285.84 → 3292.80] especially because like precision boost whatever AMD calls it their boost technology is so
[3292.80 → 3298.32] good that I would actually expect this if you provide ample cooling to exceed that in some cases
[3298.32 → 3305.12] like i with just a tiny little bit of adjustment I just don't see how you're going to get any kind of
[3305.12 → 3314.24] meaningful performance uplift in games going to a 7900x or 7950x of course I am totally excited to be
[3314.24 → 3319.92] proven wrong I'd love to see you know massively multithreaded games come and I'd love to see just
[3319.92 → 3327.60] like absolutely like runaway frame rates um but i just I don't I don't foresee it happening at a time
[3327.60 → 3331.44] when the current generation consoles all have eight core CPUs I just don't think it's realistic
[3331.44 → 3337.20] speaking of which well the real ones sorry Nintendo guess what I played a little bit recently and actually
[3337.20 → 3344.00] had some fun with guitar star citizen no way yeah I would have actually thought guitar was more likely
[3344.00 → 3352.88] than that yeah yeah it only had one extremely major bug that ruined everything only one that's genuinely
[3352.88 → 3358.80] statistically not bad as far as star citizen has gone uh hey what happened to the pool can I find
[3358.80 → 3367.76] expired polls oh did someone like close it I don't see it anymore uh you can find expired polls there
[3367.76 → 3374.00] is a feature for that uh okay can you do it if I just share your screen because I want to see it's
[3374.00 → 3382.80] going to take me a second oh okay huh yeah don't yeah for sure yeah for sure won't do that uh all right
[3382.80 → 3389.60] cool so we'll have a look at the poll results uh am5 motherboards the high-end x670 and x670e will be
[3389.60 → 3394.72] available at launch while b650e and b650 will arrive in October
[3398.16 → 3404.88] this is a good question it's not going to come down to just performance if dozen 7000 and raptor lake
[3404.88 → 3412.64] trade blows but AMD has committed to support am5 through at least 2025 which is better than
[3412.64 → 3421.52] intel typically does why would anyone choose intel it's a good question I would really like to see
[3421.52 → 3427.52] intel stick to their sockets for a little bit longer to be clear AMD's track record here not
[3427.52 → 3439.04] perfect i personally, personally invested much money into their uh Styx 40 platform which they said was
[3439.04 → 3445.84] going to get future thread ripper processors which yet have not materialized zen 4 is launching
[3445.84 → 3454.24] on am5 and I don't even have a zen 3 option for my editing stations yet paid for many of those so
[3454.24 → 3462.48] let's be clear AMD's track record not perfect we got one generation of chips that was it um
[3462.48 → 3470.24] um, but they are saying that they're going to go till 2025 and intel typically does only two cycles
[3471.12 → 3477.84] so 13th gen is going to be the end of LGA 1700 theoretically which will support 12th and 13th
[3477.84 → 3483.84] gen which has been a strong argument against dozen 5000 right now because the 12th gen platform has had
[3483.84 → 3489.12] some room to grow while to our to my knowledge they still haven't confirmed any kind of zen for
[3489.12 → 3494.56] anything for socket am4 although I think they acknowledge that it could be a chance uh
[3494.56 → 3502.08] amp 323 yes 5000 thread ripper pro is out now it doesn't fit in a Styx 40 socket fat lot of good
[3502.08 → 3508.32] that does me I didn't want thread ripper pro I wanted thread ripper for my Styx 40 socket
[3508.96 → 3516.24] um right so in the current battle 12th gen versus dozen 5000 12th gen is the smart play all other
[3516.24 → 3521.52] things being equal wouldn't you rather have an upgrade path if am4 is dead end so the same thing's
[3521.52 → 3527.92] going to happen again where raptor lake is going to be the end of LGA 1700 probably if is intel's
[3527.92 → 3533.68] pattern is anything to go on while am5 could have one two maybe three upgrades still
[3536.56 → 3542.32] now that's not to say that you'll get the absolute most out of those future chips on this older
[3542.32 → 3546.80] platform motherboard, but that's another thing AMD has done a pretty darn good job of is maintaining
[3546.80 → 3554.56] that performance across multiple platforms okay you got it yep let's have a look at the results I can't
[3554.56 → 3565.44] see them oh all right leading the pack it's actually surprisingly flat no one has more than 15, and it's Henry
[3565.44 → 3574.48] Cahill Cahill Cahill Cahill Cahill 14 okay Henry Cavill at 14 but like Adam savage is one percent
[3574.48 → 3581.60] behind drug everything is one percent behind him tied with smarter every day like it's its it's very
[3581.60 → 3588.32] close I guess what you guys are trying to say is that there's a lot of potential collabs out there that
[3588.32 → 3594.96] you think make a lot of sense there 's's a collab that is trying to happen right now um
[3594.96 → 3600.64] oh that I don't I've I have I've tabled it to jams you don't mean project farm right nope okay
[3600.64 → 3605.04] someone reached out to me, I've tabled it to jams project farms review the screwdriver by the
[3605.04 → 3610.32] way going up Sunday apparently I'm stressed but I'm excited okay what's this other collab hit me do you
[3610.32 → 3615.84] want to know who it is sure yeah what if you decide not to do it would that be weird i I don't know
[3615.84 → 3620.40] there's a thousand reasons that a collab might not work out so given that I'm not committed to it in
[3620.40 → 3627.60] any way at all okay then I guess you can go ahead and tell me okay despite um this might me reaching
[3627.60 → 3633.76] out before and getting ghosted I have now been reached out by glasses uh who is as much as I'm salty
[3633.76 → 3643.76] about that a fantastic YouTuber who makes fantastic content um about keyboards, and he wants to make with
[3643.76 → 3652.08] you he wants to come out here a socks and sandals keyboard what the heck is a socks and sandals keyboard
[3652.08 → 3659.12] I don't know, but the ingenuity of this man is high and I expect great things he's made a triple keyboard
[3659.12 → 3666.40] before which is literally just three keyboards beside each other he made a custom 400 keyboard which is not
[3666.40 → 3674.72] actually like additional keys which you might think it's just extremely, extremely large he's done many
[3674.72 → 3681.12] many amazing things um and I think it could be hilarious all right you know what I'm down but
[3681.12 → 3686.56] yeah that's a that's a potential collab I'm down yep cool all right I'm into it, I don't know
[3686.56 → 3691.60] what form it'll take or when it'll happen but I'm interested in it, i kind of want to troll him I mean i
[3691.60 → 3698.32] still have a t-powered computer so clearly I'm a little behind on collabs right now but yes
[3699.76 → 3704.80] yeah all right chat's pretty into it, I will say as much as you, you do need to do that t-powered
[3704.80 → 3708.96] computer I think this one's a little easier I think he's going to fly here with the things that you need
[3708.96 → 3714.64] and then you just like build it with him oh wow that's really easy hashtag lie I think that's what's
[3714.64 → 3720.96] going on I'll have to I'll have to follow up again to figure out more details, but yeah okay there was one
[3720.96 → 3728.32] last thing for dozen uh 7000 by the way PCIE gen 5 and PCIE 5.0 SSDs will come to market in October i
[3728.32 → 3735.76] think that we've kind of reached the practical limit of um PCIE SSD speeds mattering for consumers
[3735.76 → 3742.16] for the next few years uh yeah that's good especially because there are other bottlenecks
[3742.16 → 3747.60] that are going to be concerns long before that kind of massive sequential throughput is going to be a
[3747.60 → 3753.52] problem still good though oh is my bleep not working you want that level of component
[3753.52 → 3759.52] to be ahead that's fair that's fair because new hardware will come, and you want your old
[3759.52 → 3764.32] platform to be ready for it, I mean there's nothing more frustrating than going back to an old system
[3764.72 → 3771.36] you know like uh I don't know let's say intel 2000 3000 series and going yeah this is still totally
[3771.36 → 3780.64] fast enough for what I need to oh my god it has like two usb3 ports yep 100 yeah oh good gigabits
[3780.64 → 3785.92] Ethernet is what we're going to think about anything older than like a couple of years ago yeah really gigabit
[3785.92 → 3793.52] I'm trying to transfer a freaking file here yeah come on for real though for real yeah oh man do we want
[3793.52 → 3801.28] to talk about this intel arc thing oh wait um Luke do you want to guess which one you think it is I'm
[3801.28 → 3805.84] not gonna I'm not going to say it publicly I'm gonna wait for you guys to find out it was on the list but
[3806.40 → 3815.84] do you want to guess um you can just point your mouse pointer at it and I'll say yes or no originally it was this
[3815.84 → 3824.72] yeah that was my first one by the end of it I was thinking this before chat voted before okay it's
[3824.72 → 3825.04] neither
[3828.88 → 3835.60] yeah I won't react yeah yeah yeah so that'll be that'll be interesting yeah that uh yeah
[3835.60 → 3840.48] i have things to say about that regarding my guests but I will say nothing for now wait till
[3840.48 → 3848.16] after I show yeah yeah yeah there are definitely um things that you might say yeah okay intel says
[3848.16 → 3852.32] arc is as good or better than NVIDIA at ray tracing
[3854.72 → 3862.00] okay so here's the thing about ray tracing is that it only really matters if your rasterization
[3862.00 → 3870.32] performance is also good we've seen GPUs that just you know had ray tracing hardware on them
[3870.32 → 3875.28] but simply weren't powerful enough for that to matter because you weren't going to be gaming at
[3875.28 → 3883.36] a reasonable level of visual fidelity anyway so tom Peterson told pc gamer the RTU or ray tracing unit
[3883.36 → 3888.64] that we have is particularly well suited for delivering real ray tracing performance, and you'll
[3888.64 → 3895.52] see that when you do ray tracing on comparisons with a RTX 3060 versus an a750 or a7700 we should fare
[3895.52 → 3901.44] very very very well the intel graphics YouTube channel released a ray tracing technology deep dive
[3901.44 → 3907.12] yesterday where they showed some actual software everything from benchmarks to real games
[3907.12 → 3913.60] running on their arc hardware so let's go ahead and skip to some of the timestamps that matter actually
[3913.60 → 3920.88] Luke do you want to give me some timestamps here uh at 18 seconds there's ghost wire Tokyo running on
[3920.88 → 3929.28] an a770 with ray tracing here we go wow thank you YouTube compression this looks like absolute
[3929.28 → 3936.24] horse so that's cool one of the problems is any visual stuff on YouTube yeah what am I even what am
[3936.24 → 3943.28] I even running at here oh cool auto 360p because I'm not on a 10 gigabit internet connection
[3946.00 → 3949.44] I had a twitch clip I don't really watch twitch, but it was a clip
[3949.44 → 3952.48] I had a twitch clip that was shared to me the other day and I was like wow this looks horrible
[3952.48 → 3959.68] I figured out it had auto to 144 and I was like that's I'm amazed tell me you don't care about
[3959.68 → 3964.64] Vaud and the Vaud experience without telling me you don't care about the Vaud experience yeah um
[3965.28 → 3974.40] at 10 46 it shows 3d mark direct x-ray tracing featured uh test on the a770 versus a 3060 at 1445 it
[3974.40 → 3979.92] shows an intel spheres demo there 's's some there's some cool stuff um yeah so you can check
[3979.92 → 3984.88] that out but here's our discussion question and this is sort of a big one if this card were released
[3984.88 → 3992.64] today okay amidst the pricing apocalypse in the GPU market right yeah so let's let's head over
[3992.64 → 3999.52] to new egg if these cards were released today with all the the the warts that they have like I mean even
[3999.52 → 4004.80] aside from the issues that intel has acknowledged with things like direct x9 performance right
[4005.36 → 4012.40] um we've encountered other problems like emulators just these are small community projects they don't
[4012.40 → 4017.52] have giant teams of developers they don't have billion-dollar companies behind them right my experience
[4017.52 → 4024.08] running uh emulators on intel graphics hardware has been awful and emulation is it's a huge part
[4024.08 → 4031.20] of why pc gaming you know why a device like the steam deck is so great because you can play literally
[4031.20 → 4037.04] every game ever not literally but you guys understand what I mean right so knowing that there are going to
[4037.04 → 4048.88] be caveats in a world where a RTX 3060 is slashed all the way down to 380 bucks brand-new okay that was
[4048.88 → 4053.44] the lowest one that I saw we're going to head over to eBay okay these are remembered these are current
[4053.44 → 4060.40] gen cards we're not even talking last gen cards that can achieve equivalents performance so let's
[4060.40 → 4069.44] have a look at our sold uh no not condition come on sold items yeah here we go where are people
[4069.44 → 4076.16] paying like new pricing for oh that's a ti okay here's a 3060 for 308 dollars
[4076.16 → 4088.24] uh here's a 3060 for 250 dollars 300 bucks 300 bucks 290, so these are going for as little as 250 to
[4088.24 → 4095.76] just, just around 300 dollars at this point um what price would intel need to come in at
[4095.76 → 4099.92] for you to consider an arc alchemist GPU what would it take
[4099.92 → 4109.20] like unless it's okay no I'm going to let you go first actually oh we should pull again let's let's
[4109.20 → 4117.76] let's pull so I want to see like 200 to 250 250 to 300 300 to 350 because I don't think anything above
[4117.76 → 4122.56] that is reasonable I mean you can put in 350 to 400 I guess we might as well just have it there right
[4122.56 → 4131.04] okay I'm working on the poll okay Luke's working on the poll uh well maybe I should I push out okay
[4131.04 → 4135.44] do I am I just an idiot and I can't find the poll tool like I don't see how to do it I think so
[4138.88 → 4144.08] okay where's the button it's really straight oh it's not in the chat window that's why you can't find it
[4144.08 → 4152.64] it ah yeah it's just to the just barely to the bottom right of the player well there it is look
[4152.64 → 4157.44] at that, and you just make a poll like and now that you know that when the player when the new player
[4157.44 → 4164.96] launches yeah it's probably going to move cool so and the new player is launching like imminently okay
[4164.96 → 4170.72] perfect thanks Luke that's really helpful yeah no worries okay I want to hear what I want to hear what
[4170.72 → 4178.24] you say the uh what's what's your reasonable yeah what's the what's the arc
[4178.24 → 4184.08] alchemist price range for the because remember this is so we're talking to a 770 okay a 770 that's the
[4184.08 → 4190.48] that's the one that they're positioning against the 30 60 what's the price range that would get you to buy
[4194.00 → 4198.16] what's the maximum price range that you would buy it I think you're overthinking it
[4198.16 → 4204.56] there were too many characters in the title I had to redo I see what's your price
[4208.72 → 4212.48] choose your price to me, i for me all this victory it's like
[4214.72 → 4221.28] it's tough because at different times I would have said different things because right now I use my
[4221.28 → 4229.12] computer for work a lot, so there isn't one sure you know what I mean I'm not willing I need something
[4229.12 → 4235.36] very stable got it okay because if i if i can't get my computer working no I'm going to flip this
[4235.36 → 4239.12] around on you, I'm not going to let I know I'm not going to let you hide behind it's no, no no, no wait
[4240.96 → 4245.36] I'm not done all right okay all right at other times I thought he was gonna cop out I was I look
[4245.36 → 4251.12] like a cop I can understand it looked, and it smelled like a cop for sure I would also say though at
[4251.12 → 4256.64] other times in my life I really like this type of stuff oh so you would just get the newcomer just to
[4256.64 → 4261.12] like very likely try I would want to see what's going on I would want to try the different emulators
[4261.12 → 4265.60] see which ones broke figure out why see what those emulators were doing about it figure out what the
[4265.60 → 4270.96] problems were tried different games that would be very exciting and enticing for me so I'd probably
[4270.96 → 4279.04] say the 300 to 350 range because I wouldn't want it to be more expensive sure but I would be willing
[4279.04 → 4284.16] to take the risk if that makes sense all right here is I'm going to throw one more scenario at you though
[4284.16 → 4290.48] what if it was today, and you were you now okay, but it wasn't for work this is purely for a gaming rig
[4290.48 → 4297.44] because and before you answer I want you to consider the challenge that we had um that we
[4297.44 → 4302.08] undertook recently where we switched to daily driving Linux i I wanted to do this with these
[4302.08 → 4308.96] cards so the social I think I mentioned that the social aspect of gaming yeah is like a huge part of
[4308.96 → 4314.56] it and that was a big part of what I felt like you and i both missed out on during the Linux challenge
[4314.56 → 4320.80] the struggle is that even though its run was a were able to get a lot of games running sometimes
[4320.80 → 4326.40] with a fair bit of work if you can't play what everyone else is playing it doesn't matter how well it
[4326.40 → 4332.40] performs it just doesn't matter because you are not able to have that social experience
[4333.52 → 4338.64] and Conrad said if it's cheaper than 600 I'm not buying it I don't buy anything that's not expensive
[4338.64 → 4344.96] because it makes me feel because it makes me oh shut up Conrad you're just trolling you're trolling
[4344.96 → 4359.12] where's Yeezy um I don't know if that's serious or not well at any rate um he's kind of a baller
[4359.12 → 4366.56] here's the here's the poll results I'm sorry here's the poll results okay I think he's true the winning
[4366.56 → 4372.56] the winning result is 200 to 250 bucks over on float plane yeah because everyone wants it to be
[4372.56 → 4380.16] as cheap as possible getting 46 of the vote um although a massive 36 of you are saying 250 to 300
[4380.16 → 4388.00] is also fine with 13 of you saying 300 to 350 so actually you're in the're in the 13 Luke
[4388.00 → 4392.88] yeah who are saying like yeah it just needs to be competitive it doesn't actually need I find it
[4392.88 → 4397.68] very interesting I think it would also change depending on what card I currently have if I had
[4397.68 → 4404.56] a card that was you know it could still do it with modern games then I just wouldn't get rid of my
[4404.56 → 4411.60] current card right away right because then you could always bail yeah um but if I had a card that was
[4411.60 → 4417.44] like it died or something I might be less willing yeah like you uh it would depend on my life stage
[4417.44 → 4422.24] because there were definitely times in my life that I didn't have enough capital to like have a
[4422.24 → 4427.36] spare GPU yeah like I would immediately be flipping that you'd have to be able to afford the next one
[4427.36 → 4432.96] 100 yeah so like it depends on a lot of things, but there's definitely price ranges and scenarios here
[4432.96 → 4439.84] where I'm down 100 I'm very intrigued by these GPUs i uh I think I even mentioned like us doing a
[4439.84 → 4443.60] challenge where we have to run it when it was announced or something like that was a long time ago i
[4443.60 → 4450.00] don't remember if I did or not um but i it's very interesting to me, i I've always really wanted
[4450.00 → 4456.32] intel to succeed with this because I want another player in the space uh Luke can confirm that i
[4456.32 → 4462.24] didn't change the formatting of the person that I pointed to who was the person that was sponsored
[4462.24 → 4467.12] no all I did was move the cursor next to it uh the formatting is different for different people
[4467.12 → 4471.84] because just the document is oh and I just didn't bother I mean it's just different for the top one
[4471.84 → 4475.84] because it was the first one that was typed in so it still had the like header yeah yeah no so don't
[4475.84 → 4484.40] read too much into it guys change it um all right let's go ahead and where's our food at
[4485.76 → 4490.48] and he didn't point at it by like changing the font that's extremely unnecessary if you've ever used
[4490.48 → 4497.68] Google Docs before he just put his cursor there uh for the food I think he went home for a bit
[4497.68 → 4502.16] I looked on the map he was in the's he's almost here okay after I messaged him saying hello are you
[4502.16 → 4508.40] coming I saw his car turn around and start coming back towards us so uh you know it might be cold
[4508.40 → 4510.16] Naxos with the lads, but we'll find out
[4514.16 → 4517.20] I mean cold chicken and warm I was going to say how long has it been
[4518.08 → 4521.60] because like cooked chicken it's been long enough that Uber eats is like we're so sorry
[4522.64 → 4527.12] so yeah right but like is it like okay because it's cooked chicken yeah it's not been that long okay
[4527.92 → 4532.48] it's only like two hours do I get like a partial like refund or like how does this work I do believe
[4532.48 → 4540.00] so it's been a very, very long time um okay cool like an hour and a half yeah for those of you who
[4540.00 → 4545.52] haven't got any merch messages in, yet we are going to be responding to the curated ones from bell
[4546.08 → 4550.56] um in a little bit we're just we're waiting for our food so we wanted to get through all our topics i
[4550.56 → 4553.28] just thought the food was going to be here a little sooner we're getting some chicken
[4553.28 → 4559.28] cool candles with the lads I like it a lot hey you know what's cool I get to cover a controversy
[4559.28 → 4568.32] that's not my own for a change yeah yeah let's go yeah we did it uh brand is facing backlash
[4568.32 → 4575.36] after posting a production update for their steam deck accessory kit project kill switch uh the notes
[4575.36 → 4580.24] were prepared by Riley so if there's anything wrong in here then I blame Riley on Thursday
[4580.24 → 4585.92] brand posted an update source to uh original update from brand here we go and this is in
[4585.92 → 4594.00] r slash steam deck it'll load eventually I promise we actually do have fast internet here because we
[4594.00 → 4600.72] care about people's productivity and mental well-being man loading just bothers me so much more now than it
[4600.72 → 4608.40] used to uh the social team posted an amazing meme that was like ah my game is taking an hour to
[4608.40 → 4615.68] download and then like the like uh yes I will listen to this mp3 after a night of restful slumber like
[4615.68 → 4621.20] i just my mentality was good has totally changed about it, I thought that was it still doesn't bug me that
[4621.20 → 4627.36] much I like having fast internet but like I'm not I'm not willing to fork out the funds for gigabit
[4627.36 → 4632.80] right now so they posted this update talking about the release date talking about some different
[4633.20 → 4639.04] stoves uh how the reservation was going to work uh some different scenarios and look at this kind of
[4639.04 → 4644.16] some stuff like that price elasticity of demand percentage of customers willing to pay at i
[4644.16 → 4648.56] don't even know what any of that is so cool anyway they posted an update um
[4648.56 → 4658.24] um they said that they would launch September 28th in the form of an essential kit at 59.95 and a travel
[4658.24 → 4665.68] kit at 74.95 well the the the update number four says December or September 25th well sure
[4666.56 → 4671.84] users immediately noticed the absence of any mention of the tempered glass screen protector which many
[4671.84 → 4677.28] thought would be bundled with every other component in one kit since it was listed along with the other
[4677.28 → 4682.80] components on brand's website source three which I won't bother clicking right now this led to anger
[4682.80 → 4686.80] that brand was ripping people off by removing an item from the bundle after promising it would be
[4686.80 → 4693.28] included some users criticized brand for charging extra for basic components in an official response
[4693.28 → 4697.76] posted under an hour ago brand explains that they initially announced project kill switch as an
[4697.76 → 4702.16] umbrella term to encompass their suite of steam deck accessories in fairness I did not know that I thought it was
[4702.16 → 4709.36] just the case so I apparently was not even um among their audience one of the two camps in terms of
[4709.36 → 4714.56] how they interpreted that camp an assumed all six items would be included as a single product purchased
[4714.56 → 4719.92] at one MSRP so case kickstand travel cover skin for the case screen protector and stick grips while
[4719.92 → 4725.52] camp b assumed you want to see it all six items were standalone products here's the source okay got it
[4726.96 → 4731.52] complicating things is the fact that the screen protector launched six months ago and was purchased by
[4731.52 → 4736.40] brand says the majority of kill switch reservation holders who paid a three dollar reservation fee
[4736.40 → 4740.40] which was subtracted at the form the price of purchase the way brand sees it including everything
[4740.40 → 4745.60] in one bundle what camp a want would saddle 68 of reservation holders with a duplicate product
[4745.60 → 4749.60] so they split it into two kits and keep the screen protector as a standalone purchase however
[4749.60 → 4754.16] there's also the fact that prior to update number four brand reservation holders received an email
[4754.16 → 4758.56] with a survey asking what price they'd be willing to pay for a kit brand included this data at the
[4758.56 → 4761.36] bottom of the Reddit post okay that's what we were looking at, so users are accusing
[4761.36 → 4765.68] brand of making this decision after finding out that they could make more money by splitting the
[4765.68 → 4771.68] products up in this way huh okay um
[4777.12 → 4783.52] is there like a pre-order an image of the pre-order page well it wasn't really a pre-order so people
[4783.52 → 4790.72] couldn't have purchased it they hadn't announced pricing so no one put their money down um yeah
[4791.36 → 4795.60] I mean so does it matter
[4798.24 → 4805.36] I don't know I don't really get it the okay so the original picture the uh the um
[4806.96 → 4814.56] let's see not the update number four not that but the picture screenshot of kill switch listing
[4815.20 → 4820.96] tempered glass as a component this I could definitely see being interpreted in different ways
[4821.36 → 4828.48] um because this says pro can I zoom in yeah, so there's a project components thing at the bottom
[4828.48 → 4832.96] I'll make this huge and then share my screen so that people can see what I'm talking about so
[4832.96 → 4838.40] this is at the bottom project components impact resistant grip case magnetic kickstand skins tempered
[4838.40 → 4844.80] glass travel cover stick grips um, but it doesn't like it doesn't like say
[4844.80 → 4853.68] like I don't know it could be a line of products it could be one package of products it doesn't say any of
[4853.68 → 4862.64] that I don't know yeah i um also there's no pricing so what does it even matter if it's included or not
[4863.20 → 4869.20] if they made the tempered glass thing you can just buy it right you can buy it now yeah so I don't get it
[4869.20 → 4877.20] if they never announced the pricing what does it actually change so just add one of the bundles
[4877.20 → 4880.00] to your cart and then also add the tempered glass to your cart
[4882.96 → 4889.52] okay people including I put three dollars down for project kill switch what does that even mean well
[4889.52 → 4896.08] that's that's to like reserve like basically it's to indicate interest in a way that brand can actually
[4896.08 → 4902.64] kind of count on like i I wish that when we had taken screwdriver or backpack interest levels that
[4902.64 → 4908.32] we had taken like some token amount of money because it's a much uh it's a much larger commitment
[4908.32 → 4913.44] do you make that refundable uh so the way it works is when you place your order it's included or
[4913.44 → 4918.40] something like that, and it's a fairly negligible amount like it's three bucks so I think for them they
[4918.40 → 4924.00] saw that as justifiable um now that we've done things the way that we've done them I don't know that
[4924.00 → 4927.60] we'll change it just because it's kind of working for us and everyone has their own way of doing
[4927.60 → 4932.48] things, but it's definitely something that I'd want to reevaluate next time we have like a sign-up for
[4932.48 → 4937.60] notification um you know do we want to take some kind of deposit do we not want to take a deposit we
[4937.60 → 4941.44] had a lot of people say we should have taken a deposit kind of like uh valves done with the steam jack
[4942.08 → 4948.72] um okay yeah so I don't know we'll, we'll, we'll think about it um I don't know for me the most
[4948.72 → 4955.76] interesting part of all of this is the way that brand can pivot between being antagonistic towards
[4955.76 → 4966.00] their customers and the absolute uh royal crown king and queen of trolling the entire world
[4966.56 → 4975.36] and being like meticulous and professional in their communication um but all without not being them
[4975.36 → 4982.48] this is probably the funniest line in this whole response uh replying to this Reddit post
[4982.48 → 4987.68] can you attach the travel cover when the deck doesn't have the kill switch case on does the
[4987.68 → 4993.36] deck fit in the valve supplied case with the travel cover on by their understanding the travel cover is
[4993.36 → 4998.96] a truly standalone component usable without a case at least 12 other users seem to agree with their
[4998.96 → 5005.20] understanding at no point did we suggest this was a chance this user is simply mistaken
[5005.20 → 5011.20] while it is fair to hold us to a higher standard of customer uh consumer education on interoperability
[5011.20 → 5015.44] the reality is that we have almost 11 years of data to support the notion that this type of
[5015.44 → 5023.44] misunderstanding is unavoidable at scale they just basically called people idiots but in the most
[5023.44 → 5030.00] professional way that I think I have ever seen I think they're I mean this is the first time I've seen
[5030.00 → 5037.76] any of this stuff, but there yeah there's no reason to me why oh no I don't know yeah I don't even say
[5037.76 → 5042.32] it's a magnetic kickstand I don't know I don't get it I don't know I'm over it I'm over it
[5044.64 → 5048.72] if you don't if you can't refund it's a pre-order don't go back on your word yeah that makes sense to me
[5048.72 → 5057.36] all right um yeah I mean I guess if people didn't know what they were buying then brand's biggest
[5057.36 → 5064.08] sin here is just not figuring out the plan it is very unclear I will say that much when you go to
[5064.08 → 5070.96] the project page it says project could like we're doing this project we're we're looking for interest
[5070.96 → 5077.60] whatever reserve yours for three dollars the project includes all of these things my base
[5077.60 → 5082.32] assumption would that would be that it I'm buying this thing that costs this much
[5083.68 → 5087.28] or not that costs as much I actually have no idea how much it costs, so there's no way in
[5088.08 → 5092.56] hell I would ever do this because why would I reserve something that I have no idea what the price
[5092.56 → 5097.76] for it is um but yeah I mean that's that's up that's other that's other people's thing you
[5097.76 → 5101.36] can do whatever you want but I would assume that it's one package that has all of this
[5102.08 → 5106.24] but again if it's all possible for sale, and they didn't say how much it cost
[5109.12 → 5117.92] yeah then who cares I don't know I don't really get it I don't think this matters but i also just
[5117.92 → 5123.28] learned about it now and don't really understand everything that's going on so sounds good uh trust
[5123.28 → 5127.20] daft asks I wish float plane took up more of the screen when not full screen thankfully picture in
[5127.20 → 5130.56] picture is there the new player is it going to have like a theatre mode style thing there has
[5130.56 → 5139.04] a theatre mode cool coming very soon coming mythical new player um all right the chick oh
[5139.04 → 5143.76] the chicken's here the chicken's here we've got some chicken that means I think it's time to do some

[5149.92 → 5154.96] uh we've had some people saying they don't like merch messages like clogging up the tech
[5154.96 → 5159.84] discussion so we're doing all the tech discussion front loaded so if you don't like you know the
[5159.84 → 5166.80] q a stuff and all that good goodness then um see you later yeah, and we're hungry so we're going to have
[5166.80 → 5174.64] some dinner hey thanks bell you rock man um you didn't by any chance uh happen to get your hands on

[5188.32 → 5193.84] the fork well I don't know i I told you I've never had Lando's before I don't know what the sauce is
[5193.84 → 5202.08] for that is some that is some lukewarm chicken oh boy that is lukewarm AF we both get one of these i
[5202.08 → 5205.28] thought we got different things I don't know no we both ordered the same thing that's why i

[5211.92 → 5217.28] basting okay so that's just for the chicken I got this is whatever goes on the salad yeah I don't
[5217.28 → 5222.32] on the salad I think there's a whatever I don't know what this is I don't even know what's happening
[5222.96 → 5228.24] I don't even know what's happening wait did this order literally take an hour and a half to
[5228.24 → 5236.64] arrive and didn't come with forks wow this is amazing all right bon appétit everyone do you have
[5236.64 → 5241.52] to like to say that you need forks bell while you get settled in I'm just going to get a couple merch
[5241.52 → 5247.04] messages go in here okay oh man there are a lot of curated ones tonight all right cool uh Caleb
[5247.04 → 5251.52] asks what's the longest road trip you've ever taken currently on a 10-hour drive thanks for the
[5251.52 → 5257.84] infotainment I don't actually know which one is technically longer um that's what she said but I've
[5258.56 → 5263.12] but I've road tripped to Winnipeg and I've road tripped to Arizona I feel like Arizona's longer
[5263.12 → 5268.56] Arizona's quite a bit further pretty sure I've never mapped it oh crap and Canada's big oh crap i just
[5268.56 → 5275.20] threw rice all over myself this is not good is it you mix it like that that's what I've done before
[5275.20 → 5279.84] well I don't I don't like no I don't have I haven't had this container there's rice everywhere
[5279.84 → 5286.96] if I get a bowl I usually like shake it thanks for nothing Luke I'm sorry uh the longest road trip I've
[5286.96 → 5291.28] ever been on should I try it now I almost don't want to if it just sprayed everywhere was to Halifax
[5291.28 → 5296.80] I was going to do with the fort so I drove across the country when i learned to drive um
[5297.52 → 5304.48] so the day I got my learner's permit right so I was 16 years old exactly the day I got my learner's
[5304.48 → 5311.60] permit um I took my knowledge test that's if it's purely a knowledge test and I walked out to the
[5311.60 → 5319.12] parking lot all excited, and my mom was like what they are you doing that's the passenger seat you drive
[5319.12 → 5332.00] now and I was like uh okay this is a manual car i you had no training on manual yet no so she's like
[5332.00 → 5339.84] well no time like the present so I drove out of like the I wouldn't call it a city like it's maple ridge
[5339.84 → 5349.12] like it's not but I drove out of the ICBC licensing office in maple ridge home um stick which was
[5349.12 → 5356.00] interesting then we packed, and we left because my birthday is in the late summer, and we needed to be
[5356.00 → 5364.40] back for school to start, so this was a trip we were back for school, and we left on either my birthday or
[5364.40 → 5370.48] the day after or something like that um that was a long way there's a lot of being in a car with two people
[5371.04 → 5377.28] yeah um it was good though it was very memorable it was one of the most memorable things I've done in my life
[5377.28 → 5387.36] definitely worth it cool next question here is from uh NCC 1702
[5388.32 → 5392.72] Linus your existential dread about leg and your legacy has inspired me to change how I train people
[5392.72 → 5399.84] that is irrelevant but would you ever have LTT themed framework accessories whether it's the
[5399.84 → 5403.04] shell or other parts of or components
[5406.08 → 5409.44] the training thing is kind of ominous I wonder if that's a good thing or not
[5410.16 → 5413.84] well I think it is a good thing I think that we should always try to
[5415.68 → 5422.08] it depends what the goal is right so if my goal is to build something that provides information to consumers
[5422.72 → 5428.00] long after I'm dead then I should be preparing for me to be dead as soon as possible
[5428.96 → 5435.60] right but if my goal is to run a company well then obviously I don't really give two hoots about
[5435.60 → 5439.52] what happens to it when I'm dead because my goal is just to run a company right so
[5440.40 → 5443.76] yeah it's I don't know there's a lot of people here that are younger than me, they will
[5443.76 → 5450.00] outlive me um you know I don't know that the younger people than me like the Jake bell events is of
[5450.00 → 5453.44] the world the Luke left friend years of the world I don't know that they'll still be here
[5453.44 → 5460.00] I don't think I'm going to outlive you for that long that's fair um that's an inside joke that is yeah
[5460.56 → 5467.36] not explaining the point is i I do think it matters so my for my goal it matters a lot um as for your
[5467.36 → 5474.72] question re framework uh LTT branded framework accessories any business decision has to be like it is
[5474.72 → 5480.56] starts with a Venn diagram like it's so it's so simple we learn it in grade two grade three
[5480.56 → 5487.44] or whatever it is, but it's such an important life skill anytime I do anything I basically start drawing
[5487.44 → 5496.08] a circle um and I try to find you know what the what the necessary circles are that will land on
[5496.08 → 5501.68] the person who is interested in that service or that product or that piece of content and I talk
[5501.68 → 5508.64] honestly even not this week because I was on vacation but last week I probably had a Venn diagram
[5508.64 → 5514.48] conversation with two separate writers whether it's pitching a video concept or whether it's um you
[5514.48 → 5521.68] know during the script a paragraph that they've written where I've gone okay this paragraph is relevant to
[5521.68 → 5530.48] people who are super into Linux people who get this joke you've made and people who um you know have
[5530.48 → 5537.20] been keeping up with the current events that uh this like news thing that you alluded to so
[5537.20 → 5542.64] you've got these circles and you've got this tiny little intersection you've got small circles with
[5542.64 → 5547.68] the tiny intersection and basically it doesn't land unless all of these stars align you wrote this joke
[5547.68 → 5552.40] for yourself take it out yeah you know like those kinds of conversations they're tough conversations but
[5552.40 → 5558.56] it's a really important training exercise so that you don't just spin your wheels producing products or
[5558.56 → 5565.52] creating content that nobody actually wants to consume right um, and so I feel like the LTT themed
[5565.52 → 5571.36] framework accessories fall there no offence to framework love their mission invested
[5571.36 → 5577.60] in the company right, but their market share in the laptop space is it's not a circle it's a dot
[5577.60 → 5589.76] you know, and so we need that dot to out to overlap with LTT uh viewers right we need that we need the
[5589.76 → 5598.08] subset of LTT viewers that will actually buy anything LTT branded that want to rep the brand they have to
[5598.08 → 5602.80] actually have bought a framework laptop right so you got people interested in framework people interested in
[5602.80 → 5608.40] LTT people who actually bought a framework and people who are willing to buy something from LTT you're
[5608.40 → 5612.48] asking for so many stars to align I just don't think it's feasible there's minimum order quantities
[5612.48 → 5616.32] right like if it was some 3d printed thing that we could throw up on thingies or something or
[5616.88 → 5621.52] I think thingies ran afoul of like the creator community or something I don't know don't quote me on
[5621.52 → 5626.56] that but whatever the trendy whatever the trendy place to throw up 3d printing files right um
[5626.56 → 5632.40] um sure, sure yeah that's fine but if we're talking a mass production product where you have to
[5632.40 → 5638.32] make a thousand or five thousand ten thousand of them I just don't think it's feasible there's also i
[5638.32 → 5643.84] think I think within the kind of whole idea of framework and things that we have promoted in the past
[5643.84 → 5654.64] um try to go to like a hobby space and laser cut your own vinyl yeah sweet I did it my laptop
[5654.64 → 5661.44] has a purpled brand skin on it and then someone I was talking about wanting to do it and then someone
[5661.44 → 5665.84] sent them to me better than I would have made which was fantastic nice, and it's an it's a haunter
[5666.40 → 5669.68] there are eyes in the mouth, and it goes on the purple it looks like haunter, and it's amazing
[5671.20 → 5679.52] looks super cool still there still holding up really well yeah it's great uh question for both of you
[5679.52 → 5683.20] this is good, but it's a really wimpy amount of chicken yeah you were talking about how there's
[5683.20 → 5687.60] going to be way too much chicken, but those are all fake photos yeah like this is like nothing there's
[5687.60 → 5691.36] like no chicken there's actually very little chicken yeah if anything I'm disappointed in
[5691.36 → 5697.12] the amount of chicken I need more dead bird Lando's reach out we want the sponsorship we'll change our
[5697.12 → 5702.96] minds yeah we'll make a whole segment or something question from jay for the both of you do you have any
[5702.96 → 5713.12] games on your phone yes what RNA I've talked about on the show before it's an um I don't know what to
[5713.12 → 5720.64] call the category map game GPS game whatever, but it's like a Pokémon Go what I really like about it
[5720.64 → 5726.96] Pokémon Go alike yeah sure what I really like about it is I think you know the story of Pokémon my thing
[5726.96 → 5731.76] with Pokémon Go it launched I didn't look into it, I went on a hike because I wanted to get a geo dude
[5731.76 → 5737.28] for sure and there's no Pokémon in the mountain because yep they want you to funnel into these
[5737.28 → 5743.44] PokéStops RNA is not like that at all RNA will actually detect like hey there's a forest here
[5743.44 → 5748.40] we're going to make it a forest biome there will be more forest things uh same thing for water stuff
[5748.40 → 5754.56] like that so it is has significantly more stuff built into it that encourages you to get out there
[5754.56 → 5759.12] and move around and right and go on hikes and go off-road and do those types of things which I think
[5759.12 → 5764.48] is very cool so I've been enjoying if it is a mobile game there are some pay to make your
[5764.48 → 5769.76] gameplay more successful I wouldn't necessarily say win is there a win you'll get
[5769.76 → 5775.20] more yeah exactly that's the problem you get more loot and stuff though so you could perform better
[5775.20 → 5780.80] with the amount of gameplay time that you invest which i kind of do see as a form of pay to win um
[5782.08 → 5789.20] but yeah RNA's sweet I enjoy it is encourages me to go outside I have some games i oh I get quests all
[5789.20 → 5797.52] the time like go walk 2 000 meters and I'm like cool um I have checkers free chess um oh I also have
[5797.52 → 5803.76] chess nice little time killer with the kids I have dress colouring um sometimes the girls like to sit
[5803.76 → 5809.84] and play with my phone sure um I have minecraft on here apparently I've never opened it I don't know
[5809.84 → 5817.28] why that's on here yeah I have lee chess and chess.com I don't know why I didn't think of those I use
[5817.28 → 5824.32] those all the time text twist 2 that's just like a comfort food game um Yvonne and I like to
[5824.32 → 5830.88] play together I have retro arch on here unicorn colour book glitter that's also for the girls and
[5830.88 → 5836.24] that's it that's it for the games on my phone I'm not really a big mobile gamer anymore I used to play
[5836.24 → 5842.08] more mobile games back when they were just actually like simpler in a way they've kind of gotten too
[5842.08 → 5847.44] complicated for me like I'm not going to sit down with the intention of playing a game for an hour on
[5847.44 → 5855.20] my phone like, but it was like happy jump like yeah I'm on the flappy bird stuff like flappy bird that
[5855.20 → 5862.40] era of games was like that's all I wanted for sure um yeah agreed here's some uh bell lore to give
[5862.40 → 5867.44] them some more time to eat I love mobile games I play a lot but I prefer the ones that you can just
[5867.44 → 5873.04] buy and be done 100 so without explaining here are a bunch of ones you should check out hole down
[5873.04 → 5879.84] well slay the spire uh wait, so this fire is on your phone now oh I play it so much on the phone it's
[5879.84 → 5884.88] perfect for the phone because you can just like click it, and it saves your spot, and you can move on
[5884.88 → 5889.60] with your life and go back and keep playing oh no so I have many hours in that uh loop hero also on the
[5889.60 → 5895.60] phone also plays great on the phone a dark room uh the one I'm going to explain so they have more
[5895.60 → 5901.44] time play down well it's a just go down the hole and try not to die it'll cost you like five bucks but
[5901.44 → 5910.80] it's great cool next question here from bearded yep
[5910.80 → 5918.40] yeah it was fine yeah it's been it's been great it's perfect
[5922.56 → 5926.64] next one here you guys tweeted out a while ago uh this question's from Brandon by the way that
[5926.64 → 5932.16] you're looking for the next big thing I shouldn't be no chat saying you were that's probably old
[5932.16 → 5937.60] classic chat always such pranksters uh we tweeted out what should we make next now that
[5937.60 → 5941.20] we have the backpack and screwdriver out it was there anything that you read that you were like
[5941.20 → 5945.12] actually this is a good idea or something we should consider there are definitely some good ideas that i
[5945.12 → 5952.16] saw um I saw someone posted that we should do a glow in the dark screwdriver um I messaged that to nick
[5952.16 → 5955.92] who said apparently it was already on the list and then Yvonne said that she had suggested at some
[5955.92 → 5963.12] point so apparently it was already like on the know random future ideas list I'd say some of the
[5963.12 → 5968.64] the most obvious ones are a smaller version of the backpack get a lot of people asking for that yeah
[5969.28 → 5975.28] RGB screwdriver uh that I don't think we have planned anytime soon smaller version of the backpack
[5975.28 → 5981.52] though uh maybe costed down as well yeah I think people might end up disappointed at how
[5981.52 → 5987.12] little it ends up affecting the cost because most of the cost is in the construction not the raw materials
[5987.12 → 5992.88] and the construction is really complicated it's its a really complex bag to manufacture that's a big
[5992.88 → 5999.20] part of why it costs so much um I saw a fascinating post breaking down how much we've made
[5999.20 → 6006.00] on backpack and screwdriver on Reddit um no way that's accurate it was not accurate um our costs so
[6006.00 → 6014.56] I just want to make it really clear uh it is expected, or it estimated our costs at 25 of our retail price
[6014.56 → 6020.64] that is not even close on either backpack or screwdriver our costs are substantially higher
[6020.64 → 6028.00] than that on both of them because materials construction logistics they all cost a lot of
[6028.00 → 6033.92] money more than you obviously more than you think they're profitable we're making money like it's good
[6033.92 → 6040.48] it's its good business uh, but it's not uh yeah we're not making what would that work out to like 400
[6040.48 → 6049.92] 400 points on them that's that's not happening um other stuff I mean yeah we'd, we'd love to do more
[6049.92 → 6054.80] variants of the screwdriver there's an email from you that I need to respond to I've been mulling it over
[6055.44 → 6061.60] I think super no like aggressively no oh wait what did I say is this not it was about um
[6062.96 → 6070.24] buying up a certain company buying a company making a thing that I theoretically wanted at one
[6070.24 → 6079.20] point oh we should just talk about it uh i I pitched to Luke I was like hey we have officially
[6079.20 → 6086.48] launched more tools than the coal bar hammer company maybe we should just offer to buy them
[6086.48 → 6095.20] and finally push it over the finish line no, no no, no no for for for a wide variety of reasons I think no
[6095.20 → 6101.12] no, no no, no no, no I'd love to hear more about your reasons um it has taken this long
[6103.68 → 6108.88] what do you think the state of the project I don't know if you buy the company do you buy their debt
[6112.32 → 6117.20] I don't know maybe but do you make the coal bar hammer and do you make that back
[6117.20 → 6125.76] do you want to make the coal bar hammer would you be better off just sickening kyle or
[6125.76 → 6132.16] whoever else on ice it makes no sense but let's say you even wanted to make a hammer
[6133.20 → 6140.40] I think you'd be better off just having him design a hammer instead of just buying out this probably at
[6140.40 → 6146.40] this point in time not even good design for a hammer and like it tries to do way too many things
[6146.40 → 6152.72] if all you had to do was be able to break into a crowbar and also be a hammer and that was it and
[6152.72 → 6157.36] just limited the other stuff he could probably make one that was way better I have some bad news Luke what
[6157.36 → 6161.36] top message or I should call it top package
[6169.36 → 6170.24] from nick light
[6174.24 → 6180.00] not gonna lie I thought about the coal bar idea a month or so ago I think it's hilarious and I'm down
[6180.56 → 6185.04] how many people are even going to get the joke it doesn't it doesn't have to be a joke maybe we can
[6185.04 → 6191.92] actually make it good why would you want to make a what relevant okay back back back I get it I didn't
[6191.92 → 6199.12] buy it for me, I have a hammer it's great it's a hunk of metal that goes up and then goes both
[6199.12 → 6204.24] directions but is it also a pry bar, and it's and all the other crap it does
[6206.88 → 6211.60] darn it uh I don't I don't think most people are going to get the joke
[6211.60 → 6219.28] it doesn't even have to be a joke what if it's just good I buy the coal bar hammer for my dad says
[6219.28 → 6225.60] Conrad heck yeah we can all buy one for I was going to say if we sell is we sell a coal bar hammer
[6226.16 → 6231.76] indirect indirectly to everyone's dad then it's fine we're doing great business model
[6232.48 → 6238.72] in all seriousness um I do have one that I'm pretty excited about that is very early stages so who knows
[6238.72 → 6243.68] if it'll ever even make it across the finish line but I want to do a battery bank that is
[6244.80 → 6252.88] kind of steam deck style, so oh don't replace the cells but also if you're going to do it here's how
[6252.88 → 6258.64] to do it yeah that'd be sweet, so the idea would be like the last battery bank you would ever buy
[6258.64 → 6264.64] yeah um if it's is it's possible you know I'd love to figure out if there's a way for us to make
[6264.64 → 6272.40] the firmware upgradable so that if you know let's say someone like Nintendo who uses used but in kind
[6272.40 → 6277.68] of a wonky different from everyone else way, so your switch can die if you use a standard power brick
[6277.68 → 6285.20] like um you know that sort of thing right so if there's a way for us to firmware update it so that
[6285.20 → 6290.56] we can account for things like that obviously things bad things might still happen but if we can continue
[6290.56 → 6297.04] to tweak it over time I think that would be a super valuable product and I think that's one of
[6297.04 → 6303.20] the big things uh that we're we're really going to continue to focus on as we go forward because that's
[6303.20 → 6310.40] what's really differentiated backpack and screwdriver is we figured out what we wanted to exist and then
[6310.40 → 6314.80] made it exist right like with something like a t-shirt I think there's a little less room for innovation
[6314.80 → 6320.48] but for something like that um that battery bank I think absolutely we are identifying something that
[6320.48 → 6326.24] is a problem, and we're fixing it I hate to say it yeah it's been said a million times it's been
[6326.24 → 6334.80] thought about I think it might have even been decided to not do but if you do socks and if you do sandals
[6334.80 → 6345.84] you've literally completed the outfit you could walk outside respectively maybe not respectively you
[6345.84 → 6354.72] could walk outside legally wearing entirely LTT clothing that would be pretty sick I understand
[6354.72 → 6359.92] it's hard to do, but that would be pretty sick and the amount of people that would buy socks and sandals
[6359.92 → 6363.92] LTT edition I think is I think is pretty solid I think there's a business argument there as well
[6363.92 → 6372.08] um I need new socks pretty bad I've been holding out for like years the real motivation yeah oh for
[6372.08 → 6378.32] I'm being transparent about it um it's time I have to go buy new socks so we're not going to hit my time
[6378.32 → 6385.28] window unfortunately but uh yeah I think that'd be sweet um darn tough if you guys want to work together
[6385.28 → 6397.76] hit me up yeah um deodorant frankly we don't make anything we couldn't make anything strong enough
[6397.76 → 6408.24] for our audience um love you guys, but bare feet is hygiene legal not everywhere there are places that
[6408.24 → 6422.88] you have to have coverings on your feet um I don't know I don't know speaking of buying companies if
[6422.88 → 6430.00] you could choose another content creator to join the leg staff who would it be um I don't know how to
[6430.00 → 6435.20] answer this question without it being like yeah that's tough I think honestly I think we I think
[6435.20 → 6441.60] we skip that do I abstain how about instead of the one I could pick like a one that I'd love to work
[6441.60 → 6447.44] with all of them a few we would love to work with everyone I mean it's tough you know ah man it's tough
[6447.44 → 6452.32] because just because I really like someone and respect them as a content creator and would love to
[6452.32 → 6457.28] work with them every day doesn't mean I think they should be acquired right like let's take okay
[6457.28 → 6462.48] let's take someone we talked about last week okay Sarah disci right she has a totally different
[6462.48 → 6470.24] perspective on tech she um there's no reason to do that yeah great on her own exactly she's doing
[6470.24 → 6479.20] great on her own she's probably more valuable to the greater community as an indie um why like what
[6479.20 → 6487.92] if all we wanted to do was you know make sure that she had considered let's say she hadn't just
[6487.92 → 6492.96] killed it on her lab 22 launch or whatever else so let's say that our you know she was struggling in
[6492.96 → 6497.52] some way or something if all we wanted to do was make sure she had like consistent income or something
[6497.52 → 6503.12] like that well like what are we what are we getting out of it so presumably we expect profit at some point
[6503.12 → 6510.32] so if that's our motivation well what are we going to do to squeeze her publication for more profit is
[6510.32 → 6515.68] is that even going to provide any kind of service to her viewers it has to be a win-win-win right it
[6515.68 → 6519.44] has to be a win for us a win for her and a win for the audience and if it's not a win-win-win than it
[6519.44 → 6524.40] doesn't make sense and I can't think of too many that would fit in that category
[6524.40 → 6534.40] yeah it's tough that's really tough because i i I mean you see what was it CNS
[6535.84 → 6540.80] you see what CNS did to people yeah just extract value you don't want to be a man
[6541.52 → 6546.16] that's stupid blame and annoying and no one likes you, and you're dumb um
[6549.04 → 6552.64] so like Linus said there has to be value in both directions there has to be something that's
[6552.64 → 6561.68] truly beneficial for them and uh we could get them editors and videographers and stuff like
[6561.68 → 6567.44] that, but a lot of these creators already have solutions for that some creators actually are
[6567.44 → 6573.20] unwilling to give up the creative control of editing so want to do it themselves um which is
[6573.20 → 6577.12] respectable that's an approach whatever I'm not making any judgment on that but like some people
[6577.12 → 6583.12] wouldn't even want those benefits is what I'm saying um yeah I don't know it's really tough
[6584.88 → 6588.16] there's a lot of people that I would like love to work with more closely because I think it would be
[6588.16 → 6592.00] freaking awesome uh but I don't think that would necessarily be better for anyone other than it just
[6592.00 → 6593.20] being like cool
[6596.32 → 6602.88] question here from jay do you think we'll ever see ram slots on GPUs for choosing how much ram you want nope
[6602.88 → 6605.04] nope
[6605.84 → 6612.80] never should we explain in more detail or just leave it there all right we'll explain in more detail
[6613.84 → 6621.52] what's the trend you see in terms of ram's physical proximity to processing power let's look at um
[6623.12 → 6628.88] apple's m1 processor where they've actually got the ram right on the package closer
[6628.88 → 6637.12] GPUs were one of the first consumer devices in your system that brought the ram
[6638.80 → 6645.92] off of uh off of an installable module that's just out of necessity quite physically distant from the
[6645.92 → 6652.16] processor and from the memory controller and put it right on the board soldered to the board right next
[6652.16 → 6661.44] to the processor why because GPUs needed mono memory bandwidth in order to move texture data and
[6661.44 → 6669.04] other game assets back and forth so what you're never going to see then and look at the highest performance
[6670.96 → 6674.88] I don't know what that was look at the highest performance GPUs today they actually bring the
[6674.88 → 6684.48] memory even closer with HBM so those because the traces are so short are much easier to run at much higher frequencies
[6684.96 → 6693.36] and so the last thing you're going to see the GPU industry do is trend back the other way to modules like not
[6693.36 → 6699.84] only are they physically more distant but anytime you have an interface like that like a slot
[6699.84 → 6705.76] uh like a socket and a pin interface or anything like that you're going to have some loss
[6706.32 → 6712.96] and that loss is bad for signal integrity which is bad for you guessed it higher switching speeds
[6712.96 → 6719.60] which is bad for bandwidth so it's just it's never going to happen I'm pretty sure it did happen way in
[6719.60 → 6726.80] the past as well um, and it's not done anymore which doesn't always mean a lot but in this case I think it does
[6726.80 → 6733.36] is we got a food question here Luke and Linus what was the most memorable meal of your life easy
[6734.40 → 6737.52] I have an answer for this that is easy and I'll lock it in do you want to go first
[6738.96 → 6744.40] no i I hit me I think it might even be the same because you were there oh was it the first uh
[6744.40 → 6750.56] the first dinner or the first leg dinner oh, oh different one darn it
[6750.56 → 6756.48] because that was pretty memorable we had that like truffle and stuff like it was a whole I'm not
[6756.48 → 6761.12] really sure it was a whole thing yeah that was kind of the first leg Christmas party was not really
[6761.12 → 6768.72] a Christmas party and um it was awesome we could like we are okay to put it in perspective our first meal
[6768.72 → 6773.36] when we landed in Las Vegas that first year was chicken nuggets because they were cheap dude we got a
[6773.36 → 6780.24] whole table of chicken nuggets so we balled out on chicken nuggets we had no money um but to celebrate
[6780.24 → 6786.32] the success of our CES trip and the connections we'd made and uh the sponsorships that we had
[6786.32 → 6793.36] started conversations about and all that good stuff uh we went out for one nice dinner um and I was like
[6793.36 → 6798.32] maybe we'll make this a tradition that tradition has since become the Christmas the annual Christmas party
[6798.32 → 6806.96] but when it started it was just me ed Luke and Brandon and Luke's friend and uh we kind of you
[6806.96 → 6813.60] know for us went kind of wild in terms of ordering it felt pretty nuts I remember like being worried
[6813.60 → 6820.24] about the company's books because we got like a 50 fried rice I remember specifically that fried rice
[6820.24 → 6833.28] that was the as much as I remember that fried rice the food itself wasn't was not great yeah I didn't
[6833.28 → 6841.04] care like at all that that was a big moment in like my life, but the meal isn't what made that
[6841.04 → 6847.84] memorable so I think that's fair like I wouldn't have picked my wedding just because it was about the
[6847.84 → 6852.56] wedding it wasn't about the meal yeah so okay that's the reason why I think my brain didn't go
[6852.56 → 6859.20] there my brain went to a different dinner so you were also at Japan yes yeah we stayed at this
[6860.24 → 6864.80] it was a hotel in Japan that was like what's a thousand years old or some crazy like I remember
[6864.80 → 6869.92] hearing that and being like no way and then I looked into it, and it's like uh yep that's true um
[6869.92 → 6877.60] it was at a hot spring we were it was just amazing we had an an a meal in at the hotel
[6878.16 → 6884.08] in this like big open room uh there was like three waitresses for like what was it like
[6884.08 → 6891.36] 12 of us that were there or something crazy one chef for just us I still have it's its still on my
[6891.36 → 6896.88] fridge it will always be on my fridge I still have the like it's not a menu it's like the
[6897.52 → 6902.16] order that the dishes come in I can't read it because it's in Japanese but um that was
[6902.16 → 6908.32] that was an incredible meal I don't know, and it was it is does have the other components, and it's
[6908.32 → 6913.12] probably cheating because of that to be fair because that was also a pretty big moment for us
[6913.84 → 6919.84] um the people that were there were awesome there were a lot of other things going on but the
[6919.84 → 6927.60] meal itself like oh man how many it was like some insane number of courses like over 12 I think and
[6927.60 → 6932.32] chicken sashimi is definitely the most um adventurous thing I've eaten you ate it too
[6932.32 → 6937.20] yeah I didn't remember if you did yeah I remember both of us tried it yeah and then cooked the rest of
[6937.20 → 6942.16] our chicken yeah in our broth they were not a huge fan of but
[6945.28 → 6946.16] it is what it is
[6949.20 → 6955.12] um but yeah that was amazing yeah that was for the moron factory what it was tied to that trip yeah
[6955.12 → 6957.04] moron there's also a wan show
[6960.72 → 6967.28] which is probably one of the more unique wan shows we ever did um ed was passed out drunk behind the
[6967.28 → 6967.84] camera
[6972.48 → 6978.80] like it's a miracle he managed to get the camera pointed in the right direction before he fell asleep
[6978.80 → 6984.88] on the stairs but the stuff he has been able to accomplish when needed to is uh is impressive
[6985.12 → 6987.44] absolute unit yeah
[6990.56 → 6996.40] oh man okay speaking of travel Tomas asks if there's a country or place that you've always
[6996.40 → 7000.40] wanted to visit but haven't had the chance to I want to go to Australia or New Zealand
[7001.68 → 7003.76] I heard that's the place to be when the apocalypse comes
[7006.96 → 7010.96] what because they're already like trained and dealing with it no it's because there's nothing of
[7010.96 → 7016.32] real strategic value it's far enough away from everything that is of strategic value that the
[7016.32 → 7023.28] fallout won't really get there, and it's like temperate and like pretty uh developed world in
[7023.28 → 7030.32] terms of infrastructure and like standard living relatively self-sufficient I know New Zealand is
[7030.32 → 7035.60] checking a lot of those boxes specifically yep um those are definitely up there a lot of the places
[7035.60 → 7040.24] that I really wanted to go I have gone to so that knocks off a bunch of stuff to be honest I would
[7040.24 → 7045.84] really like to go back to Japan i barely even count our trip there as like actually being in Japan we
[7045.84 → 7050.80] were there for like less than 24 hours weren't they weren't we and we slept so like it was
[7050.80 → 7057.20] a very short period of time um I think I'm gonna cop out and say Japan because I don't really count
[7057.20 → 7062.40] being there for literally less than 24 hours as really being in Japan um even though i literally
[7062.40 → 7066.72] just mentioned one of my favourite diners being there I found out why this was 600 calories look
[7066.72 → 7072.64] at the disgusting amount of sauce in it yeah like I can only eat half of this I can, it's not completely
[7072.64 → 7080.16] saturated in uh mayonnaise it's got quite the aroma yeah we've got this like hummus thing though
[7080.96 → 7084.64] scrappy dwarves with hardware unboxed in Australia yeah I mean we've said all the
[7085.20 → 7089.20] unfortunate reasons why scrappy dwarves like isn't yeah it's dead sorry guys yeah
[7092.48 → 7098.24] question here from mike my kids love my LC water bottle that's not really a question would you
[7098.24 → 7102.24] consider making a smaller one for kids maybe with artwork from the ABCs of gaming yes
[7103.84 → 7107.60] we're already working on a smaller one we hadn't thought of putting ABCs of gaming characters on
[7107.60 → 7113.12] it yet but good idea yeah I get a lot of comments and uh merge message about people loving the ABCs of
[7113.12 → 7117.60] gaming so that would be cool I think it's because I specifically mentioned during the screwdriver
[7117.60 → 7123.04] stream that I read every review some people have left some really sweet reviews over the last few
[7123.04 → 7127.44] days thank you very much um it was a labour of love so yeah I really appreciate it
[7129.84 → 7132.96] next one here is from Elliot Linus you've talked about your uh
[7132.96 → 7138.48] uh disdain of closed ecosystems and smart homes many times on the show, but you've also said you're
[7138.48 → 7143.84] super down for a biometric implant are you less concerned about biotech when compared to all this
[7143.84 → 7149.04] closed ecosystems well I wouldn't go for a closed ecosystem biotech implant yeah there 's's a
[7149.04 → 7154.48] lot of caveats there the biometric implants that we're talking about are quite simple yeah like a NFC
[7155.12 → 7160.08] thing that I can just program to just like spit out you know a bunch of characters when I scan a thing
[7160.08 → 7165.04] right like I'm talking really really really basic stuff right now yeah, yeah very user controllable
[7165.04 → 7172.08] type of stuff from Joshua how did you navigate the transition from a small to medium-sized business
[7172.08 → 7176.88] I'm working for a small company for the first time, and we're rapidly growing any tips would be great
[7178.32 → 7179.52] hire a PR person
[7179.52 → 7188.32] and then don't ignore them there we go
[7193.44 → 7197.84] in all seriousness though I mean you just got to keep iterating right just keep learning as you go
[7197.84 → 7205.68] I'm not a business um I'm not like a business guru type person I'm not I don't read a lot of business
[7205.68 → 7213.52] books when I read them what I usually discover is that a lot of what I find in them is stuff that i
[7213.52 → 7218.72] did figure out along the way maybe not exactly the same way to be clear I'm not saying I'm some kind of
[7219.28 → 7225.20] genius well I figured everything out like it's not it's not like that at all but the problems that I've
[7225.20 → 7233.76] had to solve I've solved them so I guess what I'm saying is take time identify problems solve them in
[7233.76 → 7239.20] ways that are scalable for the long term don't just solve problems short term I just don't uh
[7240.24 → 7247.04] i just i I mean even the way we've moved into our house like you've seen it a room goes from
[7247.04 → 7256.96] absolute chaos to perfection because I just do not have the cycles to do something that I know I'm going
[7256.96 → 7262.64] to have to do again it's not worth it to me and that's one of the things I've I've learned as we've scaled
[7262.64 → 7269.68] and if it's not going to save you time in the future don't do if it's a flow plane question uh
[7269.68 → 7275.28] any new secret shoppers in the work hold on I genuinely don't know I'm not on the team that
[7275.28 → 7280.80] plans that type of stuff I cannot actually answer this question what I will say is you shouldn't even
[7280.80 → 7285.84] ask due to the nature of secret chopper they can't tell you, and you don't want to know because you don't
[7285.84 → 7293.60] want anyone else to know there you go yeah well pickles lord of the jar wants to know
[7295.28 → 7298.88] just a few months back you were worried about the prospect of your new products not selling well
[7298.88 → 7303.76] enough with this recent success do you feel more confident about launching future high-end merch
[7303.76 → 7310.16] deployments it always depends right like nothing I can't take anything for granted I've I feel like it's
[7310.16 → 7316.40] one of those things where if you guys just bought it because it had our label on it, I'd be like to have
[7316.40 → 7323.28] I taught you nothing you know so um I think that there's a lot of pressure on us to keep making
[7323.28 → 7325.84] stuff that stands out and will be successful
[7328.80 → 7333.84] and I don't really feel any less of that I don't feel like past success is necessarily an indicator of
[7333.84 → 7340.40] future success in in in that particular regard I think that you probably can carry some momentum
[7340.40 → 7346.40] forward but that momentum is short-lived right if you guys buy one thing from us where you're like
[7346.40 → 7352.48] oh yeah I heard like LTT has perfect quality stuff um but I didn't like this you're never going
[7352.48 → 7357.28] to buy anything again so we kind of have to we don't have to hit it out of the park every time but
[7357.28 → 7360.96] you can never hit less than like a line drive single to use a baseball metaphor
[7363.84 → 7369.36] question here from Lucas Linus you've talked about VR a lot but what are your thoughts on
[7369.36 → 7373.68] AR headsets have you tried them like HoloLens and do you think we'll ever reach mass adoption
[7375.68 → 7383.92] not with HoloLens have you tried it yeah yeah it's kind of bad yeah so for me
[7385.36 → 7390.16] really it's not a question of how cool is this technology what can we do with if it's a question
[7390.16 → 7397.28] of what do I want to do and can this technology do it for me the killer app for AR is uh
[7401.12 → 7406.32] memory augmentation I can never remember who people are or like where I know them from totally
[7406.32 → 7411.04] or the last thing we talked about or how many kids they have if I had a contact lens that I could wear
[7411.04 → 7419.12] that was like um Luke mentioned his bird last time you guys were hanging out was having some
[7419.12 → 7425.44] health related issues uh you should check in with him about that I can't even I can't, I don't even
[7425.44 → 7430.32] think I could put a sticker price on what I would pay yeah something like that I'd pay a lot for something
[7430.32 → 7434.80] and I wouldn't be the only person like in a professional setting people literally will hire
[7434.80 → 7440.56] assistants whose entire job it is to follow them around at events and like cross-reference and
[7440.56 → 7444.56] like provide them with information as people approach like that's actually a thing right so
[7445.44 → 7449.36] um in a professional setting I could see something like that being invaluable
[7451.44 → 7461.04] but I don't know man maybe navigation like a really slick navigation and a facial
[7461.04 → 7467.60] recognition thing that can tell me who people are yeah and maybe some basic information would be
[7467.60 → 7474.88] fantastic i I will remember so many details about someone and not their name and not their birthday
[7474.88 → 7480.80] but I'll remember like lots of things about them, I'll be able to jump back into a conversation and as
[7480.80 → 7486.08] long as they don't expect me to say their name or remember their birthday yeah I'll do great but
[7486.08 → 7493.28] yeah uh nighttime astronaut asks given the importance of the wan show now in terms of leg's
[7493.28 → 7498.16] contact with the community and consumers should bell be given a substantial pay increase and maybe some
[7498.16 → 7504.64] kind of crown or cape to denote his incredible role I like the crown and cape I like the crown and cape but
[7504.64 → 7511.84] see uh the reason i the reason I brought up this comment is that I see comments like this a lot you know
[7511.84 → 7517.12] uh kyle did a great job in this video he should get a raise or this person did this they should get a raise
[7517.92 → 7524.96] uh that is not how it works at all what do you mean that's not how it works what do you mean
[7524.96 → 7531.68] first you're assuming that they're not already paid fairly second of all guys the people who are in
[7531.68 → 7537.92] front of the camera are a small fraction of the people who work here you don't just give the person
[7537.92 → 7545.52] who gets the screen time the raise we have dozens of other people that supported that
[7545.52 → 7553.04] made whatever it is that bell or kyle or I am doing possible who also need to be paid fairly if we just
[7553.04 → 7560.80] gave raises to people every time they did anything of value that was public facing our pay scale would be
[7560.80 → 7571.28] like a mess no that's not how it works as much as I appreciate the sentiment when people will say
[7571.28 → 7574.08] man Anthony did a great job of this video he should get a raise
[7575.92 → 7583.60] that's just it's just not how it works I'm sorry no offence bell you know you're you're great you know
[7583.60 → 7588.24] heart they wouldn't even see the cape and the crown and cape though yeah but crown and cape I'm down
[7588.24 → 7595.04] for yeah okay you've got uh you've got a 40 crown and cape budget let's go boys yeah just let logistics
[7595.04 → 7599.84] know they can source something for you all right you could just get a Bk crown for free and then get
[7599.84 → 7607.36] a sweet 40 cape that's exactly the plan yeah nice, and we'll get you guys a bell cam so when we're doing
[7607.36 → 7612.24] merch messages we can just put him like in the middle here so we'll just get like a face cam for him
[7612.24 → 7616.00] we down we good yeah I'll get a ancient one so it looks like an old 90s
[7616.72 → 7623.52] MSN all right let's do it let's do it let's go um question from Cameron do you have any thoughts on
[7623.52 → 7629.92] the God win 3 there's been a lot of comparisons but I'd love to know your thoughts uh we checked out
[7629.92 → 7638.72] the God win max 2 recently but the win 3 oh you know what no I haven't I haven't really looked into this
[7638.72 → 7649.12] one yet sorry nope not yet someday soon looks sick though yeah another AR thing oh no this is the old
[7649.12 → 7655.20] one God win 3 noes this one's old yeah it's cool, but it's a little it's yeah it's a little older
[7655.20 → 7660.24] the slide out keyboard doesn't have a ton of value for me, I'll say that another AR thing is I would love
[7660.24 → 7669.68] a really fancy calendar slash alarm app where I can signify when like something is unmissable
[7671.60 → 7678.40] and by unmissable I mean like blast my face with it like make it so that i it's because it's literally
[7678.40 → 7685.04] covering my eyes it's like impossible to not at least respond in some way to it like do not let this
[7685.04 → 7691.44] notification not come in basically that would be great honestly that could be solved with just
[7692.32 → 7697.04] oh yeah it totally could being able to set a persistent ringer on reminders like an alarm
[7697.04 → 7702.40] like hey anyone from the android team if you're watching can that just be a feature next time
[7702.40 → 7707.52] around so that you can set a different alarm style like a looping alarm style on reminders
[7707.52 → 7713.76] and on calendar notifications that would be just a game changer for me that'd be sweet like i actually
[7713.76 → 7720.96] need to go to this meeting do not and stop until I acknowledge that I am at the meeting there would
[7720.96 → 7726.08] yeah it would be cool if you could do a like I am there thing because there's also times when you're
[7726.08 → 7730.96] like oh I get a notification okay cool I know I have to do this thing, and then you just get blasted by
[7730.96 → 7737.84] some like huge something's on fire problem that you need to immediately solve, and then you need to
[7737.84 → 7741.36] remember to go back to that meeting but once the thing is not on fire any more you forget about the
[7741.36 → 7746.96] notification while we're at it is would be great if in the calendar app I could set what my default
[7746.96 → 7752.64] reminder schedule is because I always have to go in and manually say hey I need to know the day before
[7752.64 → 7756.24] I need to know the hour before and I need to know the amount of time it takes for me to get there
[7756.24 → 7761.12] before because otherwise I won't go yeah, yeah agreed
[7762.96 → 7767.92] question we have here from a lot of people uh what are your thoughts about the person winning an art
[7767.92 → 7778.64] contest with an AI generated piece of art as someone who doesn't really um get art but who can
[7778.64 → 7785.36] certainly appreciate seeing something I like um and values the work that goes into it i
[7788.48 → 7796.32] I guess I'm excited for being able to just like for the cost of getting a print done decorate my house
[7796.32 → 7804.32] house which I think is super cool I see it as a potential um I see it as a potential danger to the
[7804.32 → 7811.12] craft though of art over time so while it's pretty easy for me to say okay uh I saw someone tweet at me
[7811.76 → 7817.12] a portrait of Linus Sebastian in the style of Rembrandt right, and they like they looked awesome if I wanted
[7817.12 → 7822.16] a portrait of myself in the style of Rembrandt I guess I could put that up um I don't but
[7822.16 → 7830.24] what's going to be the style then what will be the the the future styles that we can plug into
[7830.24 → 7835.60] our AI generator with that said maybe it's a total and totally invalid concern people create
[7835.60 → 7843.44] art just because they wish to create art and the value of something created by a person doesn't seem to
[7843.44 → 7849.76] be tied to the number of hours they spent on it the ease with which it could be replicated by something
[7849.76 → 7855.84] else it's its about it's about the person it's about that that aura around them right we
[7855.84 → 7862.64] don't we don't we don't pay a hundred thousand dollars for a painting or whatever else because
[7863.20 → 7868.00] it looks it looks ninety thousand dollars prettier than a ten thousand dollar painting
[7868.00 → 7873.04] that's just like not how it works it's about it's about who you know, and it's about connections and
[7873.04 → 7877.76] it's about notoriety, and so I don't think that an AI artist I think that it could absolutely
[7877.76 → 7885.44] take out a lot of commodity art but I don't think it's going to take out um like high-end art um
[7885.44 → 7890.24] like boutique art if that kind of makes sense yeah like hide your money from taxes art yeah it won't
[7890.24 → 7892.32] take that well it's a whole separate conversation yeah
[7895.52 → 7900.24] oh for me on the art thing I think it's just completely down to whoever's hosting the contest
[7900.24 → 7904.16] do you allow it or do you not it's like the same thing with speed runs right tool assisted speed
[7904.16 → 7910.24] runs task speed runs those are they have their own category you could have an art contest for AI
[7910.24 → 7915.04] generated art whatever I think it's down to the contest I don't think i it's i I'm going to say the
[7915.04 → 7921.12] same as Linus so I'm not in that space I'm very far from being an artist yeah Ashwin LU over on twitch
[7921.12 → 7925.52] says AI art only looks good as a professional artist you need to be able to thoroughly explain your
[7925.52 → 7930.80] context to be taken seriously sure um but yeah it's fair enough I don't give two about any of that
[7930.80 → 7937.20] but I suspect uh AI artists could also start working with gpt3 and have it write a blurb that
[7937.20 → 7942.88] goes along with the art and explain why it's cool um if you think that's a limitation now I'll see you in
[7942.88 → 7951.84] two years um but either way i just I think it's always going to be a different space yeah
[7951.84 → 7959.84] yeah I agree like smart smartphones put cameras and put video recorders in the pockets of everybody and
[7959.84 → 7963.52] that doesn't make it so that you don't still need like filmmakers right like it's
[7968.16 → 7973.84] yeah what we also see is that you can sell prompts for the AIs to generate stuff which i
[7973.84 → 7979.36] think is so interesting it's like this guy who was in the art contest was like I will share what my
[7979.36 → 7984.88] prompt was to get this art later and like is trying to sell this prompt to get the art that he had made
[7984.88 → 7993.84] that one so very interesting future I mean it's a kind of IP I guess yeah yeah it's like if you're
[7993.84 → 8001.68] if you're perfect at configuring the machine that has a value so sure yeah I'm just very surprised
[8001.68 → 8008.56] but it makes sense similar things have been done in the past question from Micah what's your favourite
[8008.56 → 8015.68] part about running a YouTube channel YouTube media company I know what's not to like it's the coolest
[8015.68 → 8017.76] job ever thank you
[8026.16 → 8031.36] the best part I don't know it's nice that someone listens you know feeling like part of a community
[8031.36 → 8037.92] um I mean we're social creatures right like we all are sort of fundamentally drawn to a lot of the
[8037.92 → 8038.40] same things
[8041.52 → 8046.24] turning what you would have done every day anyway into work is if it's a bit of a double-edged
[8046.24 → 8050.00] sword I'd say it's the best and one of the worst things about it, but it's its definitely one of the
[8050.00 → 8054.32] best even if it might also be one of the worst yeah there's a lot to love
[8054.32 → 8061.60] that's it for merch messages that's it oh well then I guess that's it for the show pretty good
[8061.60 → 8066.72] timing yeah thank you so much for tuning in this week we'll see you again next week same bad time
[8066.72 → 8067.12] same
