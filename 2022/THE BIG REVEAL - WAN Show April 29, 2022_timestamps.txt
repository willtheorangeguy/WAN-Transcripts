[2022-04-30T08:08:31Z] Video: THE BIG REVEAL - WAN Show April 29, 2022 
Long ago the audience lived in harmony, then everything changed when the 3+ hour WAN show attacked.
Only timestamp guy, master of convenience and saving everyone's time could stop it and guide the audience to the topics they were interested in
But when the world needed him most, he vanished...

[2022-04-30T05:57:40Z] Video: THE BIG REVEAL - WAN Show April 29, 2022 
The title made me click it to know whose the guy for labs. But nah, not watching without timestamps. As usual I will come back tomorrow so I can sweep the video in 30 mins for the good content and not waste 3 hrs of my day. Bye.
