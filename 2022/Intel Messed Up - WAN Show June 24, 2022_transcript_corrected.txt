[0.72 → 6.48] did do Linus went to the university I don't think you need to worry about that
[7.44 → 12.48] welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you all today
[13.12 → 21.92] first and foremost we are going to need to address the early reviews for intel's arc GPUs it is
[21.92 → 33.76] not looking good also BuzzFeed news listened to ticktock listen to us uh I have not reviewed the
[33.76 → 40.40] topics for this week apparently that's a main one so I guess we'll talk about that what else we got
[40.40 → 48.72] also a response to clinical I hope I'm saying that name correctly but clinical um and
[48.72 → 54.88] yeah in regard to featured main topics uh we're out of them now so we're diving into the other ones
[54.88 → 60.40] and I'm going to say uh GitHub copilot I don't know I have a few things to say about that it costs ten
[60.40 → 66.32] dollars now or a hundred a year there you go, and it's more widely available question mark I thought
[66.32 → 71.20] sort of everyone had access to it before but maybe not uh but yeah now it's more generally available
[71.20 → 76.24] and it costs money that was basically the whole topic wait no there's more to it man we got to
[76.24 → 90.24] talk about it for like at least 60 seconds
[99.60 → 106.08] show is brought to you by pulse wave back blaze and ubiquity oh okay I don't think ubiquity is
[106.08 → 110.88] ever sponsored the wan show before that's pretty cool hey thanks ubiquity and also yeah yeah impulse
[110.88 → 118.32] way in back blaze why don't we jump right into our first topic of the day which is that the early
[118.32 → 125.44] reviews for intel arc graphics are not looking good you know we talked about this yeah way back at the
[125.44 → 134.08] height of the GPU shortage we were like man intel's gotta ship these GPUs now because even though we know
[134.08 → 140.24] they've been delayed, and we know that they might not be on par with the best from AMD and NVIDIA right
[140.24 → 145.28] out of the gate you know first generation woes right if they manage to ship something today
[146.08 → 151.60] it's an automatic w because the pricing for everything else is so utterly ridiculous that
[151.60 → 158.48] they couldn't possibly look like idiots and yet their timing was like hilariously bad yeah because the
[158.48 → 165.28] market just tanked which is great to be very clear yeah great for gamers not great for intel necessarily
[165.28 → 174.48] um overall performance for the entry-level alchemist GPU looks like the GTX 1650 super
[174.48 → 184.24] or Radeon RX 6400 in most real world tests, and it's often beaten out by its competitors now strangely it
[184.24 → 194.80] seems to perform much better in synthetic benchmarks but unless your name is oh I don't know kingpin you
[194.80 → 200.96] probably don't care that much about synthetic benchmarks, and you want to play actual real games
[201.76 → 208.80] in what appears to be intel's reviewer's guide the only times that this was not the case in intel's own
[208.80 → 222.88] internal testing were Richard blade point where it beat the 1650 super by 2 fps and the Rx 6400 by 6 fps and
[223.84 → 230.72] Nathan where it got 200 fps across the board I have never heard of either of those games you guys will
[230.72 → 237.92] have to forgive me for being such an ignorant gamer okay so I'm just looking into this it
[237.92 → 245.68] Jakarta or Naraka oh Naraka sorry excuse me Naraka blade point looks like a very highly rated game
[245.68 → 254.48] it looks quite no it's not that new I see a Naraka blade point Xbox launch trailer from one day ago
[255.20 → 262.72] um, but then it also says initial release date August 11th 2021 so I have no idea but I think uh this is a
[262.72 → 267.84] net ease game so I wouldn't be too surprised if this is more popular in the market they're launching
[267.84 → 273.92] the GPU in and I assume that might be the same with Niuan as well so that might be what's going on
[273.92 → 280.72] I am kind of wondering if it's performing well in synthetics but not in games I wonder if it does well in like
[281.84 → 290.56] research applications and stuff I mean I can't say anything that I know gotcha all I can say is whatever's here
[290.56 → 297.52] yeah, so my drivers attested against the GTX 1050 ti with their aggregate results looking like
[298.08 → 303.36] uh the 1050 ti being about 77 of the a380s performance
[305.36 → 306.16] that's kind of a yikes
[307.52 → 316.00] the 1650 d6 being about 10 faster than the a380 and the Rx 6400 being about 10 faster now we should take
[316.00 → 324.32] early results with a grain of salt sort of because the fact that intel's own reviewers guide their own
[324.32 → 332.24] guidance materials seem to suggest that performance is going to be terrible um would add a lot of
[332.24 → 338.08] credibility to third-party testing that indicates performance is going to be terrible yeah that's fair
[338.08 → 346.32] however however however it should be noted that the a380 is supposedly the like the i3 right like
[346.32 → 354.40] the three is the the basic tier part of the arc range so it was never going to be competitive
[354.40 → 362.40] with you know a RTX 3080 or anything like that it's still a disappointing first outing and honestly
[362.40 → 368.96] I'm a little surprised that intel is going entry level first given that the convention for at least
[368.96 → 374.64] the other two players and flagship launch duopoly is to launch with your flagship and then follow up
[374.64 → 379.20] actually AMD doesn't really have any kind of method and honestly NVIDIA launches with a flagship but
[379.20 → 384.32] then a little bit later on launches another card that's better than it yeah well they're they're both
[384.32 → 389.04] kind of all over the place but in general it's a big boy card you're trying to set
[389.04 → 394.64] the tone for your new generation by launching your flagship card taking the performance crown
[394.64 → 401.20] looking like a big dog you know intel meanwhile is like hey we have this thing it's a little one it's
[401.20 → 406.56] kind of not very good but um yeah this is a little team blue slightly off-topic but what do you think of
[406.56 → 413.60] the naming scheme like the alchemist battle mage stuff and I think it's sick the numbers afterwards you
[413.60 → 421.04] like um the numbers are fine if they really meant anything but as far as I can tell okay, so an is
[421.04 → 426.64] obviously alchemist yeah right and as they release further series of GPUs it seems fairly straightforward
[427.20 → 430.40] they're going to go through the alphabet yeah it's pretty it's pretty clear where they're going with
[430.40 → 438.08] that yeah three I dig it um what the only thing I don't like about the three is that it kind of bucks
[438.08 → 446.00] the rest of the industry's trend okay uh where the first number is the generation I see what intel's
[446.00 → 452.24] doing where the letter is the generation and honestly if they maintain this naming scheme they'll
[452.24 → 459.04] probably have a more clear nomenclature than AMD and NVIDIA who just kind of seem to release that
[459.04 → 466.00] randomly and like skip random generations and yeah I mean they literally have multiple cards AMD has
[466.00 → 476.32] multiple cards with the same four numbers right like it's its it's its AMD may name dimness madness
[476.32 → 482.64] that AMD used to do a march madness promo called march madness yeah, yeah so I was trying to i was
[482.64 → 488.40] trying to figure out how you would pronounce madness anyway it doesn't matter the point is that I see where
[488.40 → 493.20] they're going with this, but it's a little bit confusing from a consumer perspective when we have an
[493.20 → 500.56] established okay GPU style first number is the tier so now you've got okay no, no the letter is the
[500.56 → 508.80] tier, and then we've got the the next the next one is sorry the letters that sorry the
[508.80 → 513.20] first number is a generation right so now we've got the letter is the generation and then this next
[513.20 → 518.40] number is what tier of GPU it is, and it used to be it is with the other guys that the first number is
[518.40 → 524.48] the generation and the second number is the performance tier the performance class then it
[524.48 → 531.20] gets a little confusing for me, I mean I haven't seen the entire arc alchemist lineup um I don't know
[531.20 → 538.00] that intel has officially announced the intel arc alchemist lineup have they officially announced the whole
[538.00 → 545.04] lineup these are apparently leaks a350m hold on do we have just like a slide okay here we go I'll
[545.04 → 551.60] share my screen we've got these are these appear to be all oh my goodness go away these appear to
[551.60 → 560.80] be mobile so we've got a350m a370m so that all kind of makes sense its alchemist it's three tier and
[560.80 → 567.60] then it's either a 50 or 70, and then you've got it's pretty typical for these companies yeah to leave
[567.60 → 575.12] an unused digit in case they ever want to do which is fine you know uh an a355 or something along those
[575.12 → 581.04] lines but yeah the funny thing about that to me anyway is that more often than not they're going
[581.04 → 589.68] to end up using a suffix anyway pro XT GT GTX yeah or both so you're kind of sitting there going okay well
[589.68 → 596.32] well you got to pick a lane you got to pick a lane which one is it yeah I like the yeah the
[596.32 → 600.96] numbers part and I understand what you're saying with like the leaving the conventions for GPUs and
[600.96 → 606.80] stuff I think there you have a point there I don't personally really care too much to be honest i actually
[606.80 → 611.76] really like the lettering and I like the names that go along with the lettering I think it's cool
[611.76 → 619.52] um I think a lot of stuff has gotten very serious over the years um like if you look at even just
[619.52 → 625.92] like GPU box art oh man now compared to back in the day what NVIDIA has done to GPU box art is it
[625.92 → 631.60] should be a considered a crime yeah there it's all so samey now you guys know why right it's
[631.60 → 637.68] because NVIDIA forces it they have to approve the box art from their board partners so you'll, you'll never
[637.68 → 642.32] see like cool box art anymore at least not in the North American region there's still some pretty
[642.32 → 648.64] out there like wacky colourful box art designs in other regions, but they all have to adhere to NVIDIA's
[648.64 → 656.32] rules yeah they're just also boring and sterile and like i I get it, but it's its I think it's kind of
[656.32 → 661.12] nice to just have some fun with it a little bit like alchemist battle mage like that's cool yeah I don't
[661.12 → 667.36] know why not and then i i like that they're just going along the alphabet because yeah it's really
[667.36 → 673.04] clear it's clear within intel's own stack i do understand your point of it deviating from the
[673.04 → 678.16] other one I wonder how far in advance they thought did they figure out the entire alphabet or
[678.16 → 682.24] are they going to be like google and sort of realize at some point okay we're running out of
[682.24 → 687.68] we're running out of deserts here ladies and gentlemen what are we going to do we're okay, okay
[687.68 → 695.20] new plan we invented dessert then we named our next android after you know what if we're going
[695.20 → 703.28] back to just numbers okay I don't I don't know i I feel like intel would have planned it all out
[703.28 → 710.24] I feel like that would be an intel move I feel like I might have said something like that until back when
[710.24 → 717.04] intel transitioned their Leon branding to this whole gold silver bronze platinum nonsense that means
[717.04 → 725.04] absolutely nothing with respect to performance or the application that that particular chip is intended for
[725.04 → 730.08] so no Luke I really do not think they thought it out i had this thought like a while ago it
[730.08 → 735.36] wasn't like I mean like a couple of weeks ago of like you know like we dog on companies for like bad naming
[735.36 → 741.04] schemes all the time I should make sure that like i I say good things about the next one that's actually
[741.04 → 746.96] good and then you bring that up yeah no it's pretty so that was horrible it was pretty rough that was a
[746.96 → 754.40] complete failure it was pretty rough it was trash I mean should we talk about the core 2 duos and then
[754.40 → 762.64] the core 2 quads is it two or is it four come on guys admittedly that was a while ago now that's yeah
[762.64 → 769.84] it's pretty old but yeah anyway it's looking like it's going to be pretty rough there are still ways that
[769.84 → 776.64] intel could redeem themselves if they're super useful outside of gaming then hey maybe that's uh that's part of
[776.64 → 783.04] the value proposition if their power consumption is extremely low maybe that's part of the value
[783.04 → 791.36] proposition we also haven't seen their sick cards yeah like if these are competing with like 50 series
[791.36 → 796.40] cards like these aren't a lot of the cards that people would be buying to really push for gaming
[796.40 → 802.32] anyway so we'll have to see until they uh we'll have to see when they bring their big stuff out and to
[802.32 → 807.52] be fair I don't think that I could call this like a disappointment because I don't think anyone thought
[807.52 → 812.16] they were going to come out swinging super hard either I mean I think a lot of people were hoping
[812.16 → 819.28] hoping for it yeah especially fair enough during the shortage when GPU pricing was just pushing graph
[819.28 → 826.00] pushing gaming out of reach yeah for I mean majority of people gaming was legitimately out of reach for a
[826.00 → 830.48] lot of people i I had communications with a bunch of people over the last couple of years that were like yeah
[830.48 → 836.24] I mean if my computer dies I'm just done yeah it's like yeah that's fair yeah for real it's too
[836.24 → 840.64] expensive unlike you, they have to pay for hardware Luke yeah no problem dude I still remember that
[840.64 → 846.56] conversation it was a great conversation do you even remember that conversation no, so one time back
[846.56 → 852.32] when we were still working at CX um you were nervous about something to do with the business and
[852.32 → 857.68] stuff um, and you were talking to me about my compensation because my compensation was ridiculous
[857.68 → 863.20] because I was getting paid below minimum wage at the time yeah, and you were like yeah yeah and you
[863.20 → 869.60] were like all I could say is I'll make an agreement if you keep working with me in whatever capacity
[869.60 → 875.44] I'll always make sure you have a like a sick gaming machine you did clarify that it's going to be not
[875.44 → 880.40] as good as yours
[882.72 → 888.40] you made sure to get that in there, but you're like I'll always make sure you have a computer and I was
[888.40 → 893.20] like cool I'm going to hold you to that and yeah every once in a while I bring it up it's great well
[893.20 → 898.08] I mean I forgot about it and I've still done it so I guess you know there you go yep it's been good
[898.08 → 905.20] it's been good I love these like ancient agreements they're fantastic yeah man I sure agreed to a lot
[905.20 → 912.56] of stuff back then Geez it's good uh another thing that we know about arc alchemist is that it's going
[912.56 → 922.64] to support both av1 decoding and encoding so it could be the only GPU you can buy today that will still
[922.64 → 931.84] be able to keep up in the video transcoding world five eight ten years from now when av1 is
[931.84 → 941.92] prevalent yeah not now yeah I mean not now av1 is sort of not that not super um not super relevant today
[941.92 → 951.36] yeah but someday we hope oh speaking of someday we hope we uploaded a video a little while
[951.36 → 957.28] ago talking about the deplorable state of HDR support on YouTube and I might have some bad news
[957.28 → 964.32] for you oh I heard through the grapevine that that might have ruffled some feathers over at Google
[964.88 → 973.52] and that they might actually be um paying attention now to the problems that have I mean i this is the
[973.52 → 978.16] kind of thing that's a good thing I don't whatever yeah well I'll get to that oh, but it's the kind of
[978.16 → 985.28] thing that drives me crazy why do you need a high profile influencer to complain about something
[985.28 → 992.48] that is obviously broken why don't you just see that something is obviously broken and put it on
[992.48 → 998.72] the roadmap to fix it, and you know I got a lot of flack for talking about this in the context of
[999.28 → 1005.60] what was it I forget it was some other thing on YouTube or so oh the Vasco situation I think
[1005.60 → 1011.04] was it Vasco got flack for that I don't know someone else the point is I got flack
[1011.04 → 1017.28] for you know taking this you know why don't you fix things that are broken position do you remember
[1017.28 → 1023.52] what I'm talking about now no but I just realized why this is bad yeah um it's coming uh but I got a
[1023.52 → 1028.24] lot of flack for taking that position and when we don't have our own house in order we there's
[1028.24 → 1033.84] things we do wrong uh there are things that our development projects could do better, but you got
[1033.84 → 1044.00] to understand like in the context right google has literal armies like literal armies of developers
[1044.00 → 1051.60] and they are sitting working on pointless that nobody asked for when core functionality is still
[1051.60 → 1057.12] broken or actively working to remove certain functionality that's what's frustrating about it
[1057.12 → 1063.68] that's what sucks they're running all these experiments for features no one asked them for when just
[1063.68 → 1069.28] basic stuff is not working I mean you want to see something that's a joke I knew the app was
[1069.28 → 1073.12] going to come up which is why I mentioned the remove removal of different functionalities here's
[1073.12 → 1078.24] a joke this is great watch this I can create a community post okay look at this I can put an
[1078.24 → 1084.08] image pull a text pull I can write some text I can put a picture but heaven forbid hold on
[1084.08 → 1089.44] let's go to the Linus tech tips check how the devil do I just get to the channel from here freaking
[1089.44 → 1097.04] okay community post wait what they work now holy crap my community posts are working okay is that a
[1097.04 → 1102.08] problem with that phone hold on this is hilarious yeah yeah it doesn't work on to my knowledge any
[1102.08 → 1110.80] foldable phone hold on let's go ahead lets uh whoa okay all right it works hold on can I post a story
[1111.52 → 1116.32] nope still can't do that all right never mind so yeah still can't post stories I've reported it's been
[1116.32 → 1121.20] two years it's been over two years I've reported it many times as far as I can tell it's just like
[1121.20 → 1127.52] a switch they need to flip in the tablet version of the app, but they don't they don't do that where
[1127.52 → 1132.80] was I going with this uh yes right so they're finally paying attention to HDR which would be
[1132.80 → 1138.64] amazing because it is legitimately a better viewing experience when done right there are still some
[1138.64 → 1146.96] things they need to fix for example on android HDR will just oink your brightness control sort of
[1146.96 → 1154.96] I mean this is pretty funny uh watch this so I'm gonna pull up a HDR video okay so you can see if i
[1154.96 → 1162.08] oh stop so you can see if I do this here I'll do it like this and go full screen right okay so it that's
[1162.08 → 1167.76] clearly very HDR and I go and I try to edit my brightness and be like no, no dog you're not going
[1167.76 → 1174.32] to be editing your brightness but but but watch this it's as simple as going like this
[1175.12 → 1185.68] playback doesn't even stop it switches to a SDR or a tone mapped version of the HDR grade and I can
[1185.68 → 1196.48] adjust my brightness okay so google here's an idea free of charge if I go to the effort to swipe down
[1196.48 → 1203.84] and go like this why don't you just switch it do that yeah and then have a toggle where I can switch
[1203.84 → 1211.76] it back to HDR mode here or or or other idea free of charge let me just pick not HDR in the quality
[1211.76 → 1218.72] drop down then it solves it because it's it would be really hard for us to fully commit to HDR and
[1218.72 → 1225.04] upload all of our videos in HDR until there's some way that people who don't want to have their retinas
[1225.04 → 1230.96] burned off in the middle of the night when they're trying to watch in bed um for us to have some way
[1230.96 → 1237.44] for them to enjoy the content as well it's just going to be impossible for us to do that uh people
[1237.44 → 1243.84] are saying HDR oinks brightness on iOS 2 lol at Linus at Luke um I don't think that was the point
[1246.08 → 1251.44] I'm not sure if we'll see whatever he's doing I have no idea I didn't know this topic was even going to
[1251.44 → 1257.84] be a thing of the show so uh hold on a second I'm pretty sure you're wrong here's a HDR video
[1258.80 → 1264.96] here it is that's definitely very HDR there is and there's your brightness control so I don't know
[1264.96 → 1272.08] what you're talking about oh yeah nope confirmed no that is not a thing as usual apple does colour
[1272.08 → 1277.52] better than anyone else because they just care as far as I can tell like it's its one of those
[1277.52 → 1283.36] things apple has plenty of you guys could do this right, but instead you engineered the wrong solution
[1284.24 → 1293.12] colour is not one of those things cool all right what's the bad part well we can't have HDR on YouTube
[1293.12 → 1297.44] and not have it on float plane yeah I thought so all right sounds good we've done it before it's just
[1297.44 → 1306.40] really rough yeah but I guess we'll try to clean that up is it like clean unable um yes but without
[1306.40 → 1318.64] hiring a bunch of people that's the fun part yay okay I'm technically well I'm done now actually hiring I'm
[1318.64 → 1323.12] done the first stage of back-end developer interviews we still have to do technical
[1323.12 → 1330.32] interviews and stuff we're starting next week um but yeah so i could pluck people from there
[1332.08 → 1332.72] it could happen
[1334.88 → 1340.96] all right what's next well I think we're going to have to talk through this BuzzFeed news listened to tick
[1340.96 → 1346.56] talk listen to us topic oh yeah so everything that you thought was happening is happening how did this
[1346.56 → 1350.96] manage to make it into the dock when we don't have anything about the nothing phone in here
[1352.48 → 1359.12] I actually have not been keeping up with that so I don't know maybe we'll let you guys just live talk
[1359.12 → 1364.08] to us about what's exciting about the nothing phone, and we'll just we'll parrot it back to you, you guys
[1364.08 → 1371.36] will run the wan show in the meantime BuzzFeed news listened to ticktock listen to us last Friday
[1371.36 → 1377.52] BuzzFeed reported that despite assurances from bite dance that information gathered about users in the
[1377.52 → 1385.84] U.S. is stored in the U.S. china-based employees have repeatedly accessed non-public data about U.S. ticktock
[1385.84 → 1397.44] users what stunning what I can't believe this is happening no, no bite dance I can't believe it anyone would
[1397.44 → 1403.84] have guessed no one saw this coming we've been blind sided whatever will we do the leaked audio
[1404.40 → 1409.84] recorded 80 internal meetings with china-based employees through last fall to the new year
[1410.40 → 1415.76] in one of the recordings a member of ticktock's trust and safety department is quoted as saying
[1415.76 → 1424.96] everything is seen in China what stunning no how would we have predicted how could you are sorry, sorry
[1424.96 → 1429.52] Braden comes in and investigates what's happening
[1432.24 → 1438.80] it's worth remembering that back in 2019 the U.S. government it's like baby monitoring alarm is
[1438.80 → 1447.76] going is everything okay here the U.S. government began investigating ticktock's Chinese ownership's
[1447.76 → 1454.88] uh national security implications and a year later uh the Donald threatened to ban the app
[1454.88 → 1462.56] uh many of the recorded meetings focus on ticktock's response to that threat and their project Texas
[1462.56 → 1469.84] which would redirect protected data away from China uh bite dance is negotiating a contract with oracle to
[1469.84 → 1477.52] hold Americans data in Texas but uh what that protected data is still being negotiated the recordings
[1477.52 → 1485.28] indicate it would not include public data so profiles posts etc discussion question thank you Jonathan
[1485.28 → 1491.28] horst how should countries regulate foreign social media platforms like ticktock or even Facebook
[1492.40 → 1497.12] what sort of impact could substantive geographical data regulations have on the internet
[1497.12 → 1524.00] massive ones I mean basically the global internet as we know it could pretty much cease to exist I mean we're already seeing this happen this already exists yeah countries with essentially closed internet borders their own I mean would you call it an intranet at that point I mean on that scale and I guess it's still an internet yeah
[1524.00 → 1528.08] uh um yeah i
[1530.16 → 1538.96] oh there 's's massive substantial uh impacts from doing this type of stuff I think it's inevitable
[1538.96 → 1550.00] at this point personally I think it's going to happen yeah yeah I don't know man I think that users will rebel I think that much like in China where VPN
[1550.00 → 1570.96] use is just considered if you're willing to run the risk anyway just part of life I think you'll just see people VPN their ways out to you know watch the BBC or participate on but i I think there's going to be some amount of uh effort to start kind of setting up fences uh because
[1570.96 → 1591.12] i think i think i think like if we look at the the the war in Ukraine right now uh yeah one of the most immediate responses that happened um against Russia was this just volley of cyberattacks into Russia some coming back out for sure but like it was definitely mostly going into Russia yeah um
[1591.12 → 1599.28] and one of the immediate threats that people were concerned about coming out of Russia uh was Kaspersky right
[1599.28 → 1611.36] yeah Russian developed antivirus software um people immediately got very suspicious of that that's going to ramp up moving forward if I was a betting man
[1611.36 → 1640.96] right um and and and pieces of software and services and stuff developed in different countries that start becoming antagonistic with each other whether that antagonistic nature becomes war or not yeah um i I think it's kind of irrelevant like we're seeing this with china and the US right now over TikTok right they're not at war, but they're not exactly friends right, and they're getting highly concerned about data and people using each other's applications and stuff like that and sure china has the firewall up
[1641.36 → 1666.00] but um countries that have more open policies and standards when it comes to the internet don't uh but I don't necessarily think that's going to survive I'm not saying it is should die off, or it should survive I'm not saying anything like that i just I don't think it's going to survive that's all yeah Kaspersky is currently banned in the US I think stuff like that is going to continue I think it's going to keep going
[1666.00 → 1674.32] flow plane chat suggests can country area network yes we can oh boy um
[1674.32 → 1682.76] yeah and I mean we're seeing like mini versions of it right um like government and education institutions in
[1682.76 → 1690.82] Canada um have to work with applications that store data in Canada right have to
[1690.82 → 1698.40] um which is very difficult for small startups because uh having like data silos in every single
[1698.40 → 1704.70] country you want to sell your software in can be difficult and expensive oh yeah it would cost a
[1704.70 → 1710.24] fortune yeah so like it's its very difficult it's one of the ways that like uh during the pandemic when a lot
[1710.24 → 1717.10] of things went remote teams like blew up yeah because teams has this ability to have data silos in
[1717.10 → 1722.06] countries they had that already because there was already these regulations in place just a lot of
[1722.06 → 1727.48] places didn't really care or use it way too much but then when remote work exploded teams was
[1727.48 → 1732.44] already very well positioned to do that right um and certain other companies that didn't have that
[1732.44 → 1737.90] capability sort of fell off a little bit or at least didn't have the same gain uh that companies that
[1737.90 → 1746.58] did have that capability had um yeah it's interesting its interesting cybersecurity is like a huge deal
[1746.58 → 1751.12] and I think countries are going to start getting more and more concerned about it moving forward
[1751.12 → 1758.24] you know what else is a huge deal our sponsors um I was going to actually get over to lttstore.com
[1758.24 → 1764.72] because we have some new stuff to announce a lot of new stuff actually a lot of a lot of new stuff
[1764.72 → 1773.32] the processor hoodie is getting a reprint alongside the hard drive hoodie
[1773.32 → 1783.60] this is a kind of fun retro inspired design honestly I think that no offence to our team I think the
[1783.60 → 1789.88] colour grade on this one is not ideal it's not as you know what it looks better on that monitor maybe
[1789.88 → 1798.32] it's just this monitor okay well either way it's like a very neon pink and like a very vibrant green
[1798.32 → 1806.88] it's kind of very 90s inspired like uh blown up hard drive design on the back, and then we are also
[1806.88 → 1814.26] doing a reprint in a kind of similarly vibrant colourway of the processor hoodie these are both done
[1814.26 → 1820.82] on our own blank hoodies so they have like the French terry interior really nice really comfortable
[1820.82 → 1827.22] uh both of these are print to order so if you order it, it'll take a couple of weeks while we print
[1827.22 → 1833.28] them uh short circuit short circuit hoodie is in stock those ship immediately assuming you
[1833.28 → 1838.90] don't have anything else that is print to order or back ordered on your order, and we are launching
[1838.90 → 1850.78] not one not two notebook designs oh that's right notebooks check it out so the LTT logo one that Luke has
[1850.78 → 1857.36] there let's go ahead and oh we'll go to Luke cam nope Luke cam there we go sup Luke hello
[1857.36 → 1863.26] oh wow you get the whole unboxing experience and everything I didn't actually want to rip if it's
[1863.26 → 1870.10] kind of cool little paper you can save this for GIFs this is something that was pushed really hard by
[1870.10 → 1878.14] Sarah so it's uh she's she's really into actual paper this one's kind of the RGB LTT logo design
[1878.14 → 1884.72] uh if you want to I don't know like flip through it, it's its it's paper all right you have your
[1884.72 → 1893.14] different RGB like a little page savers yep um it's lined there are a lot of pages I find a lot of
[1893.14 → 1898.96] notebooks don't come with this many pages how is this like 234 pages or something uh yes 234 numbered
[1898.96 → 1906.24] pages four index pages three-page markers, and it's 100 GSM lined white paper this one though is my
[1906.24 → 1913.22] personal favourite I'll get you to open up this one okay this is the modern paper notebook what
[1913.22 → 1919.28] makes it modern hold on you got to show them the front you got to show them the front oh yes very
[1919.28 → 1926.78] modern much electronic there we go I had to cash it in the light properly Sarah's also a huge fan of
[1926.78 → 1932.28] spot gloss so if you ever see spot gloss on our packaging you'll know that she advocated for it
[1932.28 → 1939.80] ah whatever I'm ripping it sorry no you're good you're good it's just it paper the paper was
[1939.80 → 1947.00] made to be ripped okay, okay so if I take the little cover off of it you can see hopefully you're gonna
[1947.00 → 1951.90] have to catch the light again you're going to have to work pretty hard to catch that one uh it's sort of
[1951.90 → 1957.22] showing up I swear to you in person it's pretty obvious it's very obvious because it's uh it's
[1957.22 → 1961.90] like uh it's embossed yeah yeah there we go um, but you can clearly see there's even like the power
[1961.90 → 1966.44] buttons and stuff as if it's a tablet hold on I'll just switch to my screen here so you guys can see
[1966.44 → 1974.48] on the back we've got the logo the camera uh on the front you can see the power button or lock
[1974.48 → 1980.74] button or whatever else this one's this one's like uh like a matte finish there you go looks a little
[1980.74 → 1985.48] something like that hold on I'm going back to the loot cam oh I'm trying yeah, so this one like the
[1985.48 → 1989.86] pages on the inside the lines and stuff are oh no okay so once you get to the pages that you
[1989.86 → 1994.68] write on like the standard pages the lines are black but on the index they're orange, but they still have
[1994.68 → 2000.20] they still have the yeah the little tablet markings on them oh man you guys really it's kind of hard to
[2000.20 → 2005.42] see in that camera yeah well it's very obvious in person yeah wow you really like it looks like I'm
[2005.42 → 2009.80] holding up a blank page yeah it gets washed out by the light up emperor's new clothes no I swear
[2009.80 → 2013.64] there's a there's a tablet in here okay and this one has the three ribbons as well, but they're like
[2013.64 → 2019.10] LTT colours yeah they're gray black and orange yeah that's cool so we've got two different versions
[2019.10 → 2028.96] of the notebook and in other news we've got a crazy promo that we're running right now
[2028.96 → 2037.22] all remaining stock of the stealth hoodie the original stealth hoodie all remaining stock is 50 off
[2037.22 → 2044.26] so don't take my word for it that this is a pretty wild deal we don't do these kinds of discounts
[2044.26 → 2053.02] very often yeah what's with that um we have 1800 units in stock, and we need to clear some space because
[2053.02 → 2060.10] got it we got some new stuff coming we got some new stuff coming so it's getting a big deep discount
[2060.10 → 2067.46] and because we care about you guys so very, very much if you bought a stealth hoodie recently we would
[2067.46 → 2072.48] like to offer you know in case you're feeling burned by this discount because typically it's
[2072.48 → 2076.66] not really something that we do if you're feeling burned by this you can reach out to customer support
[2076.66 → 2082.80] we'll get you a 20 us gift card, and you can use that toward whatever else it is that you want
[2082.80 → 2087.08] in the future we don't want you guys to feel like you got screwed over if you just missed the promo
[2087.08 → 2093.68] one note for the LTC store they added the actual digital design for the HDD sweater to the very
[2093.68 → 2097.88] bottom so you can see the colours that Linus was talking about that might not be apparent in the photos
[2097.88 → 2104.28] and the tablet notebook the little battery symbol goes down as you progress through the notebook
[2104.28 → 2107.42] shut up it does not do it oh that's hilarious
[2107.42 → 2112.48] oh my it totally does
[2112.48 → 2119.64] whoops that's going to be impossible to show there we go it's just that in the corner oh yeah
[2119.64 → 2125.66] okay very cute but yes that's going to be impossible to show yeah uh okay here's the yeah there you go
[2125.66 → 2132.30] that's what it looks like yeah that's the vibrant version that that's what it actually looks like in
[2132.30 → 2139.02] person so all right so lots of stuff if you guys are thinking hey I'll just wait and I'll pick up
[2139.02 → 2146.16] one of those stealth hoodies later I would advise you not to do that we sent out a tweet yesterday so
[2146.16 → 2152.34] you're probably sitting there going it's okay they've got 1800 units in stock we sent one tweet
[2152.34 → 2160.10] yesterday and that's how many we sold oh wow okay so is that is it 1800 minus that okay, so there's
[2160.10 → 2167.30] nowhere close to 1800 left no so we sold 500 yesterday and so far today as far as I can tell
[2167.30 → 2174.74] with no additional promo um unless someone picked them up in the last another 330 are already gone
[2174.74 → 2181.10] so it's 1800 minus almost 800 so if you want to get one now's the time to get it
[2181.10 → 2189.64] let's move on to another topic shall be yeah yeah yeah oh do we really have to talk about the voice
[2189.64 → 2197.16] cloning feature from Amazon Alexa feature oh this is really uncomfortable for me
[2198.28 → 2204.28] very creepy I do not like it uh do you want to not talk about it, I can fire through it if you want
[2204.28 → 2210.92] yeah well no I'll talk about it, I just don't like it yeah it's weird okay so new Alexa uh voice
[2210.92 → 2220.52] cloning feature was uh shown off at a June 22nd conference in Las Vegas uh I think it sounds like
[2220.52 → 2226.68] you have to cue it like you have to ask for the voice in your request so as an example uh
[2226.68 → 2233.72] there's a child asking Alexa can grandma finish reading me The Wizard of Oz uh the device confirmed
[2233.72 → 2240.52] as Alexa then swift switched to a different voice uh the Alexa team apparently developed a model that
[2240.52 → 2246.04] allows its voice assistant to produce a high quality voice with less than one minute of recorded audio
[2248.76 → 2260.36] oh creepy I mean with all it was what two years ago that we did that video where we
[2260.36 → 2270.60] deep faked me and used an AI to create a voiceprint and had it host the video okay when we
[2270.60 → 2279.32] did that there was a whole consent process I had to i had to sign that they were allowed to use my voice
[2279.32 → 2286.04] in that way like there was a there was a lot of concern about the way that technology like this might be
[2286.04 → 2292.84] used, and now it's just a feature in Amazon Alexa yeah how did we go get from here to here I think
[2292.84 → 2298.60] there are huge issues with like um not to like to go down a dark path but I think there are huge issues in
[2298.60 → 2305.80] regards to uh like obsessions and like stalker mentality stuff yeah I didn't even think of that
[2305.80 → 2311.40] like it doesn't it's one minute of any audio, and then they can reproduce whatever from it right
[2311.40 → 2316.84] so if you want to be super creepy with your favourite streamer can I have Luke read my fan
[2316.84 → 2321.64] fiction you could have them read you like think about what it could read you right and this
[2321.64 → 2329.48] this says in here uh finish reading me The Wizard of Oz there's probably um forms of like erotica books
[2329.48 → 2334.20] that you could have it read you, and you could probably have it read you those books in someone's
[2334.20 → 2338.44] voice that you don't necessarily have permission to use to be clear we don't I don't know that for
[2338.44 → 2343.00] sure I don't know that Alexa will this is a lot of assumptions where so i I don't know maybe not
[2343.00 → 2347.80] maybe Alexa is kind of a prude i I don't use Alexa, but either way like it doesn't have to be something
[2347.80 → 2353.88] like that right like it could be an innocent thing I was just going as far as I basically could with it
[2353.88 → 2363.40] Alexa have grandma read me my erotica, but seriously it's creepy it's weird we're commercializing
[2363.40 → 2369.40] deep fakes of voices that is literally what's happening what if i what is I don't consent to
[2369.40 → 2377.16] this what if I'm not alive anymore to consent to this I'm like how would consent to this
[2377.16 → 2384.84] worth work what you have to say yes you can use my voice like that's probably not that hard to
[2385.56 → 2390.60] get with a different version of the deep fake right like yeah I mean Nicholas uh Nicholas Plough points out
[2391.24 → 2395.64] even if we ignore the security implications I mean that's not even where I went first
[2395.64 → 2401.64] I mean let's talk about the security implications what if you're using this to authorize something
[2401.64 → 2409.88] that's voice printed I mean voice recognition it's not it's not that great still you know there's a lot
[2409.88 → 2415.72] of leeway in the voice recognition models to allow for that you're gonna sound, but you might have a cold
[2415.72 → 2422.44] right yeah you might sound really different from day to day so it being played by a speaker versus
[2422.44 → 2428.52] coming out of your your your voice face hole i I don't see how they would necessarily be able to
[2428.52 → 2433.64] tell the difference I mean we've seen we've seen facial recognition security measures on mobile
[2433.64 → 2441.56] devices be fooled by simple flat photos in the past people are pointing out that uh if it is
[2441.56 → 2446.68] verbal consent that you have to give to it, I just gave everyone a recording of me giving verbal
[2446.68 → 2450.92] consent uh so there you go I mean I'm not saying Hitler was right
[2454.84 → 2458.28] nice now there's a now there's a recording of that too perfect
[2459.24 → 2465.00] uh well that's just that's okay i just this is maximum creepy it's an it's a meme okay it's
[2465.00 → 2469.08] a's a meme yeah yeah oh I didn't even realize we had to address that, but that probably makes
[2469.08 → 2474.12] sense you never know some people might not have known yeah totally that's a good idea um in
[2474.12 → 2479.48] Australia we have voice authentication for government services says jack of gamers yeah that's terrifying
[2479.48 → 2489.08] that's terrifying because you can queue up commands right like you can tell uh these various
[2489.08 → 2494.84] devices whether it's Alexa or google home or whatever to say a phrase when you do something right yeah
[2494.84 → 2502.92] you'd be like uh so-and-so say the thing, and then they would like to say a specific queue of words most
[2502.92 → 2503.24] likely
[2506.44 → 2511.16] nub pub over on twitch says they're already running into huge post-mortem consent issues in the film
[2511.16 → 2521.48] industry yep yeah yeah a little bit, and you know you look at how little protection uh you know oh
[2521.48 → 2527.32] musicians that's another big one those like hola holographic concerts and stuff yeah you look at how
[2527.32 → 2534.04] little respect is being given to the wishes of musicians and those are celebrities those are
[2534.04 → 2542.36] people with money whose estates might actually have the power to sue over this you know as for everyone
[2542.36 → 2548.60] else good luck iceberg in float plane chat says the social engineering potential is also scary that's
[2548.60 → 2552.44] what we're saying that's literally what we're saying oh I was even I hadn't even gotten there
[2552.44 → 2559.40] yet I was still just talking about fooling and like a machine automated yeah an automated system
[2559.40 → 2567.16] no, no no, no yeah there's a whole other level of fooling actual people and to be clear all of that is
[2567.16 → 2576.60] possible without this just takes the like level of access to everyone instead of anyone who can
[2576.60 → 2582.84] afford a 99 echo dot or however much an echo dot, or it is like came free with your phone or whatever
[2582.84 → 2588.04] you're sitting there going well the model couldn't possibly be that convincing or there might be a long
[2588.04 → 2593.48] delay as you're using it to try to trick someone or whatever else let me just say this
[2594.68 → 2601.64] all of those message me on telegram or WhatsApp comments on YouTube right it wouldn't be those
[2601.64 → 2610.20] wouldn't exist if they didn't work and so there is a significant portion of the population that
[2610.20 → 2619.16] whether it's a lack of tech-savvy or whether it's something else does not smell that as suspicious
[2619.16 → 2625.00] right so if someone's voice sounds a little off I mean all they have to do is say sorry I'm
[2625.00 → 2633.80] have a recording that says sorry I have a bit of a cold not quite feeling like myself and immediately
[2633.80 → 2641.40] our human monkey brain goes okay that's a normal thing to say and everything that is abnormal is
[2641.40 → 2648.04] now normal people aren't going to be ready for this our authentication systems are not even remotely
[2648.04 → 2655.80] close to ready for this type of stuff um Anthony's Anthony's typing in here uh I don't know if I want
[2655.80 → 2662.44] to say some of it just because you know security stuff um but he points out some things and like
[2662.44 → 2669.64] yeah like even even if something requires video uh it's it says here specifically um
[2670.76 → 2676.84] it's voice assistant can produce a high quality voice with less than one minute of recorded audio so it's
[2676.84 → 2681.80] it's its you can get a high quality voice even if it requires a video you can maybe try to pair
[2681.80 → 2687.72] that with a video or you can try to deeply fake a video, and you just have the voice or whatever else
[2687.72 → 2696.68] think about what the commit level of which whoever and no offence if you work in this kind of job but
[2697.40 → 2705.96] the kind of like drone state that someone would have to be in just reviewing voice video like voice
[2706.52 → 2713.64] like video authentication stuff endlessly day after day are they going to notice if it's not
[2713.64 → 2720.52] quite right I mean look at how easily fooled large percentages of the population have been
[2720.52 → 2726.28] by deep fakes of political figures saying things they never said or doing things they never did yeah
[2726.28 → 2737.08] terrifying lapse memory asks wouldn't this fall afoul of some state's voice recording laws I don't know

[3013.16 → 3022.60] covered okay merch message styler f asks what's your take on Annabelle's project Linus also stocking up
[3022.60 → 3031.48] on gift cards for backpack and screwdriver oh wow that is quite the order 450 bucks including a 250 gift card
[3031.48 → 3039.00] wait a second what is this what am I looking at here what is project Linus Canada
[3043.24 → 3049.72] right what is project Linus I've how have I never heard of this uh this is not if there is uh like
[3049.72 → 3056.28] a GitHub page with the actual one but I do like this become a blanketed finally check our blanket site
[3056.28 → 3064.28] well there you go project Linus um okay are there any local chapters look at that project Linus all
[3064.28 → 3074.20] right cool uh anyway, so apparently there's a GitHub or something what Annabelle oh okay it helps to put
[3074.20 → 3082.12] the i at the beginning Annabelle project Linus did they actually call it project Linus oh they did uh
[3082.12 → 3089.48] that's a little weird of them to do um I mean it could be named after any Linus just because it has
[3089.48 → 3095.40] your exact voice doesn't mean anything I mean you could read the first line of the I'm just trolling
[3095.40 → 3102.92] of the post here note this is a product pitch to Linus tech tips' oh no, no it's definitely me wow
[3103.48 → 3108.92] uh follow where is this are you finding motion switches it's on the Annabelle community uh forum
[3108.92 → 3113.64] please comment on his latest video where he calls us out for pitching him and asks his audience to
[3113.64 → 3122.20] comment below on what route he should go with his motion switches okay to be clear overall Annabelle i
[3122.20 → 3129.64] think has taken the good guy route in the smart home space as far as I can tell they have pitched me this
[3129.64 → 3140.20] privately um but generally speaking okay calling it project Linus I don't know it's not wrong but it
[3140.20 → 3149.40] does feel a little pushy I'll say I'll say that there's some pressure yeah um i you know i definitely
[3149.40 → 3155.72] would be happy to see them produce a good motion controlled switch that that is that's something that
[3155.72 → 3164.04] I wanted for my house as for whether you know I'm going to be involved in this project
[3164.04 → 3170.84] i I've told them that at this time like I just don't have the bandwidth for it so you know I'd love
[3170.84 → 3177.96] to see the product come to light but i buy that time I might have found an alternate solution anyway like i
[3177.96 → 3184.44] don't want to wait that long to change to have light switches that function the way I want in my house
[3184.44 → 3191.16] oh hey the logos and the pitch deck that's where I'm that's where I'm at on Annabelle's project
[3191.16 → 3198.44] Linus as it is apparently called I mean it's not like I can control the use of the name Linus uh what
[3198.44 → 3203.48] what have you opened the PDF there's the Linus lock do you know the Linus lock yeah there's
[3203.48 → 3209.00] a Linus bike yeah there's Linus bike like anyone can you know be Linus anything they want right have
[3209.00 → 3214.68] you opened the PDF no do it oh i I closed the tab already here why don't you just uh screen share
[3215.80 → 3223.80] uh oh yeah okay well I would prefer they weren't using our logo um
[3226.84 → 3232.84] I don't know if there's like more that said it is my belief that that particular variant of our logo was
[3232.84 → 3239.24] actually created by a community member what am I looking at is that a YouTube thumbnail mock-up
[3241.32 → 3247.00] is that what I'm seeing I think maybe I'm not really sure like I don't know if this is yeah
[3247.56 → 3254.36] yeah I think it is YouTube review video is what's on their okay uh hmm
[3254.36 → 3264.76] well I mean there it is we're we're covering it um so I guess mission accomplished in a valley
[3265.56 → 3273.00] oh this is a good question the German polar bear asks will you be making a bid for artesian builds
[3275.88 → 3281.00] oh well you don't buy the company right they're they're they're auctioning off I don't think they're
[3281.00 → 3288.92] also auctioning off their domain and oh yeah so I will not if we were to start a pc build company
[3288.92 → 3295.32] which by the way wouldn't call it that we are not we would not wish to inherit artesian builds
[3296.52 → 3303.08] legacy in any way shape or form we would really we would really much rather just start our own
[3303.08 → 3311.88] our own company I'm thinking Linus pc co because oh my goodness I'm completely devoid of any
[3312.44 → 3319.80] creativity pretty much actually oh I think we have a name for the lane vent yeah okay I think we actually
[3319.80 → 3322.60] do guys I'm pitching it I'm pitching it here
[3322.60 → 3332.92] we hosted a lan event whale land kind of goes with the Vancouver theme
[3334.12 → 3338.68] also there's some other potential yeah we can sell super expensive tickets yeah which is
[3338.68 → 3346.04] well land I love that that's great we got we have to do that I mean if a blizzard and all these other
[3346.04 → 3352.60] companies are dipping into the whale pot we might as well yeah okay whale land uh one little comment
[3352.60 → 3358.84] on the artesian builds' thing as far as my understanding goes uh they are selling builds
[3358.84 → 3365.16] that have been paid for by other people there 's's other people that have covered this very well
[3365.16 → 3375.00] oh that artesian I know just gotta find the worst way to do everything um i I have not watched it but
[3375.00 → 3381.80] uh Christopher Lee made a video about um this whole thing it's probably good I would check that out
[3381.80 → 3388.36] um but yeah i just that's like actually the worst as far as my understanding goes like all the systems
[3388.36 → 3393.88] they're selling that are built were paid for by people and then not delivered and are now being sold
[3393.88 → 3401.24] again now I think it's not clear at this time if the proceeds from the auction will be going to pay
[3401.24 → 3409.48] back customers seriously doubt it well I mean yeah that's usually not how that goes but i just I'm
[3409.48 → 3417.64] just saying we don't know there is still time there's still time for them to not be complete scum right
[3419.16 → 3429.48] the track record here not great um no, but yeah lapsed memory pitches Linus system designs LSD the reason
[3429.48 → 3433.00] why they are getting auctioned off versus shipped is how bankruptcy law works yeah that's what I was
[3433.00 → 3438.76] going to kind of say is like you often have to win bankruptcy I don't know enough about this but as
[3438.76 → 3442.52] far as my understanding goes it usually goes to the big creditors first yeah the problem is that I was
[3442.52 → 3448.60] going to say the creditors who are likely to get that money would be whoever artesian owes money to
[3448.60 → 3455.40] for the parts that they bought from them, so the little guy ends up getting screwed over as far as I could
[3455.40 → 3461.64] tell at the NCI auction there were customer systems there that presumably had been paid for yeah
[3464.68 → 3468.36] yeah the buyers of the builds are at the bottom of the creditor list exactly yeah, so those people will
[3468.36 → 3475.64] probably never see that uh money it's just it sucks yeah it really sucks that's another thing if
[3475.64 → 3484.04] I were to buy artesian builds I could open myself up to that liability potentially which i I mean I'm sorry
[3484.04 → 3491.00] bad situation but I don't want to just start shipping gaming computers out of pocket because
[3491.56 → 3497.80] some jackass screwed people over that really wasn't on me, it really wasn't
[3499.40 → 3507.16] speaking of things not being on me oh I managed to brick a Linux install of Ubuntu
[3507.16 → 3513.40] in less than an hour this week while attempting to film a short circuit I guess that doesn't beat your
[3513.40 → 3518.60] previous record no, but this one was professionally installed by someone else
[3519.96 → 3528.28] it came pre-installed on a laptop and I don't know what these guys were thinking but this particular
[3528.28 → 3533.40] laptop maker really cool designs by the way you're not going to want to miss that short circuit video
[3533.40 → 3537.48] short circuit hoodie now available uh you're not going to want to miss that short circuit video
[3538.44 → 3545.24] um I don't know what they were thinking shipping me a laptop with Linux pre-installed when they do
[3545.24 → 3557.64] offer windows laptops I swear to you, I swear I cross my heart I hope to die I swear to you, I did nothing
[3557.64 → 3567.48] I did nothing but attempt to launch steam and play CS go steam again what okay what happened how did it
[3567.48 → 3575.16] how did you say you bricked it how do you break it do you know well it didn't have GPU drivers
[3575.16 → 3585.08] okay so I installed drivers okay and then even though I had drivers the game was running on the GPU
[3585.08 → 3592.76] the integrated graphics so I switched it to high performance mode this sounds like more than just
[3592.76 → 3601.64] running steam but okay i I didn't say I only ran steam I said I ran steam and played CS go okay, okay
[3601.64 → 3610.36] and yes I wanted more than 11 fps fair is that unreasonable I think not okay, okay after I switched
[3610.36 → 3616.04] to maximum performance mode I was prompted for a restart which is definitely a thing Linux people
[3616.60 → 3623.24] Linux does need to be restarted so many people were on my case about that no, no I'm like windows
[3624.04 → 3629.72] 200 days up to yeah whatever there's probably some way to do without a restart I'm sure there is but
[3629.72 → 3641.08] okay it's probably way more convenient to just restart it so I was prompted to restart, and it never turned on
[3641.08 → 3647.08] again oh boy oh no
[3651.24 → 3656.84] I'd be I'd be interested in seeing what actually happened Jake figures I must have some kind of aura
[3656.84 → 3666.12] that I may actually be cursed in some way or yeah it's just not possible for Linux to run properly
[3666.12 → 3670.84] for me, I just break it by looking at it by being near it, you watch that batman movie when you're a
[3670.84 → 3675.64] kid, and it just like really resonated with you that joke's not going to hit with that many people
[3678.36 → 3678.68] anyway
[3678.68 → 3688.12] did you dude 51 asks are there any games you guys have slash will buy during the steam summer sale or
[3688.12 → 3693.96] any you'd recommend people to pick up steam summers man I haven't played that many games recently Luke
[3693.96 → 3698.92] and I were actually just going through this the other night we managed to both set aside a couple of
[3698.92 → 3705.08] hours to game we both got in front of our computers, and we were like what do you want to play I don't
[3705.08 → 3711.88] know what do you want to play hey now don't start that again we've been here before yeah we settled
[3711.88 → 3718.12] on uh divinity original sin 2 which we've managed to I mean by the time I got some kind of weird
[3718.12 → 3724.68] graphical bug sorted out that was very odd we played for about an hour yeah we got off the tutorial boat
[3724.68 → 3732.44] yeah my understanding is about this much of the total content of that game yeah so I guess we're going
[3732.44 → 3737.24] to be on that for a while which is exciting because it's actually a perfect game I've definitely had
[3737.24 → 3742.20] some stuff show up that i have wanted to pick up that is in the steam summer sale what's this
[3742.92 → 3747.48] oh well that's I know what that is but like what's up with that I can explain
[3749.40 → 3755.72] I was talking I think last week this looks like willow packaging does it is do I don't think it is no
[3755.72 → 3759.96] no this is no I mean it's its common yeah these are standard these plastic protective
[3759.96 → 3766.44] shells I mean it's not exclusive i just yeah um last week I think it was on wan show I talked about
[3766.44 → 3772.92] how I would love to treat myself to a copy of Final Fantasy 6 which in North America was called final
[3772.92 → 3780.52] fantasy 3 for the Super Nintendo uh because i no longer have my childhood copy although I do have my
[3780.52 → 3786.20] booklet i the actual game cartridge itself was lost when I moved from my dad's house to my mom's house
[3786.20 → 3793.64] along with all of my other worldly possessions and someone anonymously without providing a name or
[3793.64 → 3801.64] contact information or anything like that sent me a copy of Final Fantasy 3 so i I did not actually
[3802.28 → 3810.36] buy this puts my Super Nintendo collection up to a whopping two one console two controllers and super
[3810.36 → 3817.64] Mario RPG and Final Fantasy 6 which are uh i never actually owned Super Mario RPG when I was a kid
[3817.64 → 3823.08] but this is one of the few I think four or five games that I owned for Super Nintendo because back
[3823.08 → 3828.92] then you would rent games yeah a lot of the time you'd find out they were pretty crap actually and then
[3828.92 → 3833.72] you would return them to the store having only invested nine dollars eight dollars or whatever in them
[3833.72 → 3840.76] so I think it would be fitting for me to open it on stream and have a look at I mean the condition
[3840.76 → 3847.96] I guess it seems like based on the state of the outer box it could be a complete in box it's not like
[3847.96 → 3853.40] a mint condition or anything like nothing too crazy, but this is if it's is everything's in here this is
[3853.40 → 3859.08] worth like 300 bucks it has been loved oh wow yeah I mean that makes sense it's an incredibly legendary game
[3859.08 → 3866.20] uh magister has been reborn and the end of the world is near I remember as a kid thinking the design
[3866.20 → 3874.28] for mog was so cool and I thought this knife was like the coolest thing I'd ever seen oh whoops wrong
[3874.28 → 3880.36] one there we go Linus cam this did like this knife going through as the t and fantasy and like
[3881.08 → 3888.76] oh, oh I loved it have you ever seen any of the like manual art or anything like that no I never had
[3888.76 → 3893.56] this game i the only Final Fantasy I had growing up was on pc it was Final Fantasy 8
[3894.68 → 3899.64] the worst, and it was like a six disc set okay it's not the worst one I'm just being a hater I liked it
[3899.64 → 3904.60] I enjoyed it but I didn't play the other ones so I don't know oh wow I don't know if this is complete
[3904.60 → 3909.56] complete I don't know if to count as complete it has to have like the little Nintendo you know slip in
[3909.56 → 3916.76] there anything like that, but it has the map is always my favourite part I lost this so early
[3916.76 → 3923.48] on when I was a kid because I just was always so cool oh okay the map is not in perfect condition
[3924.52 → 3930.92] is it two different maps or is it in half nope the map came apart um and I guess at this point
[3930.92 → 3937.56] you're better off leaving it ripped than trying to tape it back together I don't I don't know but i
[3937.56 → 3942.84] spent so long just looking at this, and it's because you got to remember when you're a kid you're not
[3942.84 → 3949.00] allowed to play games all the time right yeah so when you're not allowed to play games you just sit
[3949.00 → 3954.12] and like fantasize about playing your games planning playing your game so we got the world of balance on
[3954.12 → 3961.08] one side world of ruin on the other side world of ruin really was man such a weak point for
[3961.08 → 3968.68] this game in my opinion i I feel like on the one hand it what it was trying to do was really cool being
[3968.68 → 3974.12] more open-ended and exploratory but because there's a particular order that you really need
[3974.12 → 3981.00] to do things in order to not get your ass kicked and there's not really a ton of guidance for that
[3981.00 → 3990.60] i uh i just I felt like it was not a great uh gaming experience instruction booklet oh man this takes me
[3990.60 → 3995.48] back I do have mine but I haven't looked at it in a long time man remember when instruction booklets
[3995.48 → 4000.84] were cool like this and just full of all this like concept art like you because you wouldn't know
[4000.84 → 4006.04] looking at the sprites that that's what sells Celeste I don't even know how to pronounce it uh
[4006.04 → 4010.60] there's no voice acting right was supposed to look like you wouldn't know that you would only know that
[4010.60 → 4016.12] from looking at concept art, and it's its like that's what magister area and armour and Terra is
[4016.12 → 4022.52] supposed to look like okay like it's its kind of cool because um yeah sure the graphics are so bad
[4022.52 → 4027.48] because they're like sprites or whatever but your imagination runs because you've seen stuff like
[4027.48 → 4032.44] this so you start imagining what other things look like and yeah I don't know yeah it was more
[4032.44 → 4042.04] akin to reading i I'd say yeah absolutely love it so thank you very much, so there's a there's like OMG
[4042.04 → 4047.56] stop touching it I mean guys it's not a's not a mint condition copy or anything like that I don't
[4047.56 → 4053.08] think I'm I don't think I'm knocking too much off of its value right now and besides isn't that kind
[4053.08 → 4061.40] of the point i am also an uh very on the side of like you should use the thing you know
[4061.40 → 4065.72] uh I know a lot of people are like no leave it in the box forever never look at it never do anything
[4065.72 → 4070.92] with it like what's the point of it than um there 's's one that is in not I would say not as good
[4070.92 → 4077.24] condition with the same amount of completeness with eight offers on it right now one bay for 500
[4077.24 → 4085.16] Canadian so yeah all right well I'm putting that back in the enclosure there are certain parts of the
[4085.16 → 4090.44] box like the corners on this one is are more worn, but then the other one has like dents that aren't
[4090.44 → 4096.44] on the corners bring up your screen sure um this is one that I'm looking at this is in the c stands for
[4096.44 → 4100.76] cad this is in Canadian that one's also tested working I don't know that this one is working
[4100.76 → 4105.88] I haven't tried it yet fair but yeah you can see like the even if it's not working it can be fixed
[4105.88 → 4113.64] but I would imagine from a collector perspective if you have to fix it, it's maybe worth less i
[4114.92 → 4119.56] I don't know if you would even know if the soldering was done really well but yeah see like along
[4119.56 → 4123.32] the flat parts this one has a little bit more damage as far as I can tell that one just has
[4123.32 → 4128.36] slightly more reward in corners I don't know what is worth more or less yeah I'm not an expert when
[4128.36 → 4134.44] it comes to this stuff for me, it's its not about uh like it's not the sort of thing i I don't know
[4134.44 → 4139.00] maybe I eventually would have treated myself to one, but it's not the sort of thing that i I'm gonna
[4139.00 → 4143.24] you know build up a huge collection of SNES games or anything like that, but it's still
[4144.12 → 4149.32] I mean it's the kind of thing that I'm gonna I'm going to put on my like display wall um behind where
[4149.32 → 4153.32] I'm going to be streaming at the new place so I've got a bunch of mementos from a bunch of the stuff that
[4153.32 → 4159.00] I had in my attic pretty much um nicholas Callihan helped me kind of arrange stuff he's got
[4159.00 → 4165.40] it I've got the stuff I never knew what to do with now that I've got a bigger place and I've got somewhere
[4165.40 → 4171.00] to kind of display it I've got the know that model m that everyone here like signed and
[4171.00 → 4178.12] gifted me one year uh so just so I've got like leg mementos I've got NCI mementos I've got more like
[4178.12 → 4183.56] just being a media personality mementos separately and then I've got some viewer mementos as well so
[4183.56 → 4192.04] this will definitely this will definitely go there 500k no not 500k no 500 cad also known as Canadian
[4192.04 → 4200.76] dollar yeah uh it's not a bit of rot issue inquisitor toaster it's more of an um oh what is it the
[4202.68 → 4207.32] uh the user accessible parts Anthony would be able to give you the full technical explanation of
[4207.32 → 4212.28] it but the user accessible parts where you save data to can become corrupted so you have to
[4212.28 → 4218.04] there's like a internal battery that maintains the integrity of that data and once that battery
[4218.04 → 4223.48] dies like it's a matter of when not if was this they need to be replaced a saved game not like
[4223.48 → 4229.48] a password save game yeah, yeah okay so it's possible that it needs some help it's also possible that they
[4229.48 → 4235.96] oh someone says there was a letter in the box what oh
[4238.60 → 4247.88] oh uh ALC 5440 on float plane apparently was the one who sent it and said there was a letter in the box
[4247.88 → 4254.92] it was just not given to you hmm uh they no logistics specifically told me there was no letter oh so
[4254.92 → 4262.44] perhaps your letter was a digital and uh perhaps you could
[4262.44 → 4268.52] uh control c control v hopefully um
[4268.52 → 4275.24] it was holding 3.2 volts when I tested it oh okay apparently it is uh it is good to go hey thank you
[4275.24 → 4284.84] ALC 5440 appreciate you that's awesome all right um yeah so the letter hopefully I get a chance to
[4284.84 → 4290.28] read it at some point it's tested it does work and apparently has saves okay all right cool
[4292.52 → 4296.60] those saves are probably past where I ever made it to as a kid I couldn't figure out how to beat the
[4296.60 → 4305.32] floating continent because I didn't know that you could cast magic from the overworld so I would run
[4305.32 → 4313.16] out of potions every time oh so like healing I'm assuming yeah so you could heal between comments okay
[4313.16 → 4317.16] yeah yeah yeah I did not know that you could do that because I was a child
[4319.56 → 4326.20] whoops should we do some of these merch massage yeah yeah we should uh oh right there was the
[4326.20 → 4333.32] steam summer sale thing uh I don't even know what's going to be in the steam summer sale but
[4333.32 → 4337.64] honestly I have not been excited I don't think I've bought anything in steam sales
[4339.64 → 4347.40] in quite some time to be completely honest what we sold another 400 stealth hoodies since I announced
[4347.40 → 4353.56] the deal we are now down to 600 stealth hoodies nice we had 1800 yesterday perfect
[4353.56 → 4363.72] I mean we're not making any money so it's not like yeah yeah yeah we're literally just clearing
[4363.72 → 4371.48] space in the warehouse yeah which costs money, so there's that yeah uh Conrad mentions it mentions
[4371.48 → 4377.48] uh Final Fantasy 7 r I'm assuming he means like remastered is that the pixel parts are out yet
[4377.48 → 4382.12] no it's not the pixel master not all the parts are out yet I want to play them all at once so I'm
[4382.12 → 4387.64] just not gonna I'm just not going to do it slave the spire is that going to be in it is sure is I'd buy it
[4387.64 → 4396.20] twice if I could slave spire is amazing I've put an ungodly amount of time into that game um ft if it goes
[4396.20 → 4402.92] up for sale I would highly recommend great game we're we're playing uh divinity original sin 2 that's a
[4402.92 → 4409.00] fantastic is the seam is the seam summer sale even going right now yeah yeah there are deals oh I didn't
[4409.00 → 4412.92] even know it was live there was something in my like Trello list of games to play that I looked at
[4412.92 → 4418.04] I was like holy crap this is like 70 off should I buy yeah remember I was telling you this is like way
[4418.04 → 4423.88] on sale should I buy it yeah yeah yeah and then I was like there's a lot of backlog things I still haven't
[4423.88 → 4429.32] played the Witcher 3 that's going to be the next game I play on steam deck I'm going to damn it I'm gonna
[4429.32 → 4435.08] play through Witcher 3. okay yeah nice well I'm also going to play divinity original sin 2. so that's
[4435.08 → 4441.32] the next 400 gaming hours that I can, they're both like massive games managed to set aside taken care of
[4441.32 → 4449.08] I think yeah uh Benjamin h asks what happened to all the black magic cameras any follow-up they just
[4450.52 → 4459.16] they were too noisy bulky um we had an opportunity to get rid of them when there were
[4459.16 → 4465.08] camera shortages during the pandemic which to my understanding are still not fully resolved so
[4465.08 → 4472.28] what we decided to do was uh get some Sony cameras for our uh for short circuit which I don't think we
[4472.28 → 4477.56] even have all of them yet but get some Sony cameras for short circuit we're using all of our old canon
[4477.56 → 4485.56] c200s for all the different views here boom Luke cam boom Linus cam boom wide cam and then that's it
[4485.56 → 4493.32] so I think we're using FSS and oh no FX sorry FRS sorry fs5 I was thinking different Sony cameras
[4493.32 → 4499.56] FRS and then um oh Lord I can't remember the models it's i I don't care anymore but Sony cameras now
[4500.44 → 4508.36] ft is 75 off get it Daniel c my wife and I need a new mattress I know Linus did extensive research and
[4508.36 → 4512.84] would like to know the resource resources he used in researching and about his mattress guru you want to
[4512.84 → 4520.76] get to that mattress underground all right mattress underground what rule of the internet is it
[4520.76 → 4528.76] where if it is a thing there's a ridiculously unfathomably large community of people who are
[4528.76 → 4535.08] unimaginably into that thing okay so that's mattress underground they're super into mattresses
[4535.72 → 4540.04] and you can learn what you need to know there you can find a place to get a good mattress
[4540.04 → 4544.60] I can't promise it'll be cheap but what I can promise is that you will learn a lot
[4547.56 → 4553.00] Joshua narrow asks hi Linus throughout the run of LTT has there ever come a time when the channel got
[4553.00 → 4559.00] jeopardized as in a strike or warning or something similar on the channel or like and all is lost
[4559.00 → 4567.88] moment uh I would say that there were some really um scary moments when YouTube was telegraphing that they
[4567.88 → 4572.20] were not going to allow third party brand integration in videos I mean you guys have
[4572.20 → 4578.44] seen how does leg make money we've done that video a couple of times now that is a huge portion of our
[4578.44 → 4584.60] revenue it's a huge part of what's allowed us to hire people and build facilities and buy equipment
[4584.60 → 4591.88] without it, we would not be I mean we'd survive we just we would not have the kind of amazing world-class
[4592.44 → 4599.88] team that we have today so that was a terrifying moment when we got uh when we got kicked off of the
[4599.88 → 4606.44] Amazon affiliate program that was a terrifying moment because that was a more significant portion
[4606.44 → 4614.28] of our revenue at the time the reason for it is that we were we felt allowed to promote it nowadays we just
[4614.92 → 4620.28] are super quiet about our Amazon affiliate links just because we don't want to get kicked off of it again
[4620.28 → 4630.12] for promoting it wrong um so there's that oh man what else has been terrifying beginning
[4630.12 → 4635.96] yeah the very beginning we were almost out of money six months in we didn't have you know VC funding or
[4635.96 → 4643.40] anything like that Yvonne's bank account was literally our funding, and we never did miss a paycheck we were
[4643.40 → 4652.84] never laid on a paycheck, but it was close i I even meant uh before that oh almost didn't even get it
[4652.84 → 4659.48] right yeah when we almost didn't get the channel from NCI it was an 11th hour it was literally the night
[4659.48 → 4666.92] of December 31st yes and leg was supposed to begin operation i no longer had a job at NCI starting January
[4666.92 → 4675.16] one and uh the owner of NCI had not signed the deal selling the channel to us yet over a dispute
[4675.16 → 4682.60] that admittedly I played a role in i I had uh effectively bailed out of school and no longer
[4682.60 → 4688.84] had a job either um and I think ed was in a similar spot no ed was just doing an internship with us he
[4688.84 → 4694.60] could have gone back to school at the time okay he never did manage to make it back, but he could have
[4694.60 → 4701.88] yeah yeah yeah that was a that was a tense moment yeah you had probably the most on the line out of
[4701.88 → 4709.24] all of us I did which is sort of terrifying why on earth did you do that I don't know its kind of
[4709.24 → 4718.68] stupid am I that charismatic like I don't think so what did you believe in um I've actually reflected
[4718.68 → 4725.48] on this multiple times and tried to figure out like what the hell I was thinking uh because i I was I
[4725.48 → 4732.60] was doing really well in school and then basically tanked it all to make less than minimum wage for
[4732.60 → 4739.08] some weird YouTube channel that when I started if I remember correctly had like 60 000 subs um but I mean
[4740.92 → 4746.76] I saw the trajectory while we were working there and something that I had kind of assumed was like
[4746.76 → 4751.96] yeah it's going to be super rough and maybe there isn't money from Yvonne to pay for paychecks
[4751.96 → 4756.28] but we'll probably figure it out if we don't get the YouTube channel we could start another one
[4756.84 → 4764.76] right and like it would have been slower but I was like I've gone this far
[4766.44 → 4773.72] right like I think a lot of it was that yeah because at the beginning I was just like oh well I want
[4773.72 → 4779.56] to do this uh and then the four to eight hours that we had discussed initially became significantly
[4779.56 → 4784.36] more than that yeah per week was the plan that was the original plan and then became more
[4784.36 → 4791.24] than 40 hours um but i I wanted to do it and then I started noticing my grades were slipping and I was
[4791.24 → 4798.68] like okay, but this is a potential maybe career path I'll try to juggle it better I mean I think both of
[4798.68 → 4805.16] us like to think we saw web media yeah coming hard yeah like it uh
[4810.12 → 4813.80] come on you had to break I was going to hold it together Luke I'm sorry
[4815.16 → 4821.40] uh but yeah no seriously it was like you could see the path right like it was pretty clear the growth of
[4821.40 → 4829.16] not just our channel but the whole platform it was all over everyone's faces just Justin TV was around
[4829.16 → 4835.00] like it everything was really cranking up and it and that's what everyone tells you like that's when
[4835.00 → 4839.56] you want to be on the ground floor yes so it was like yeah this is uncomfortable, but this is also the
[4839.56 → 4841.56] time in my life to do uncomfortable things so
[4848.12 → 4849.32] oh boy um
[4851.48 → 4858.20] so we made it I think yeah there's still plenty of time for this to explode we got to completion yeah we're
[4862.04 → 4867.40] I mean we're going we're going all the way in we're in deep right now I've been very I've been very
[4867.40 → 4874.04] transparent with you guys about how deeply reinvested Yvonne and I are right now business is throbbing
[4874.04 → 4880.52] we have a have a have 10 million in debt on the lab more actually I'm rounding okay we're at the
[4880.52 → 4889.48] point where you actually round to round tens of millions okay so we're 10 million in on the lab
[4889.48 → 4896.68] we are in debt on the lab and then all of our cash is deployed in inventory for screwdriver and backpack which
[4896.68 → 4906.92] is 100 000 units of screwdriver and 40 000 units of backpack so like we are we're all in again um
[4906.92 → 4912.92] fortunately if this is anything to go by the worst case scenario is we can just sell all the screwdrivers
[4912.92 → 4919.72] and backpacks at a loss, and we'll manage to get rid of them because the velocity on stealth hoodie sales
[4919.72 → 4927.48] does not appear to be uh yeah you guys probably didn't have to go quite to 50 percent you know i
[4927.48 → 4934.28] I don't know man i it was a Thursday afternoon and I was tired and Nick was like
[4934.28 → 4942.68] get rid of it or no, no wednesday afternoon was hump day and I was like I don't know nick sure yeah
[4942.68 → 4950.76] okay so we did it we did a thing yeah it is what it is look you have to be you have to be kind of wild and
[4950.76 → 4954.60] crazy sometimes it's like a three-year-old product you have to get in there you have to try new things
[4954.60 → 4959.64] new stuff coming I want to be very upfront about that you have to be creative in the business room yeah
[4959.64 → 4960.28] exactly
[4963.72 → 4970.68] Jake b asks huh really you know you don't have to send merch messages you can just talk into your mic
[4970.68 → 4977.64] it's just great merch that I want hey leg I'm an avid biohacker implants and would love to see you
[4977.64 → 4983.16] guys discuss the topic possibly in regard to Linus's house I'm excited about the new apex implant
[4983.16 → 4988.12] no idea what that is, but apparently you're hoping to use it as a password manager I've actually wanted
[4988.12 → 4993.24] to get a RFID chip in my palm for quite some time I hate pulling out my phone to scan to come into the
[4993.24 → 4999.64] building here and stuff like that I'm I'm I'm into it, but we had actually planned to do a trip down
[4999.64 → 5006.36] to Seattle to a place that does them right early 2020 and I think you guys know what probably
[5006.36 → 5012.60] happened to those plans I'd do with you 2019 whenever the covid pandemic thing happened early
[5012.60 → 5019.32] 2020, so the border was like closed for a year and a half, and we didn't do it but I'm yeah I'm I'm down
[5019.88 → 5024.12] yeah I'm in yeah there were a bunch of people we were just all going to go down and do it I remember
[5024.12 → 5030.36] talking about this yeah forever ago i I've always been very interested in the fields of biohacking
[5030.36 → 5036.68] but have never dived into it um I've I've heard stories of people putting like magnets in their
[5036.68 → 5043.24] fingertips so that they can like basically gain a magnetic sense like they can detect magnetic fields
[5044.04 → 5051.40] because it will pull on their fingertips it's kind of spooky at the same time but I would just play with it
[5051.40 → 5056.36] over and over and over again endlessly I would just do I would just do this all day
[5057.88 → 5064.20] i I think they're like really weak on purpose but um because for all these reasons um but yeah I mean
[5064.20 → 5070.92] there's a bunch of really cool stuff in that field just have never actually committed Scott g my fps
[5070.92 → 5075.08] are doing pretty well because they're my backup pair but my AirPods pros are starting to have a little
[5075.08 → 5080.36] bit less battery life less than you'd think because I'm on my third pair of them because I lost a couple
[5080.36 → 5085.88] I thought they'd turn up in the move I was sure they were at my house, but they apparently were not
[5085.88 → 5094.92] wow yep Adam what other hand tool if any would you consider making after the screwdriver I think we'd
[5094.92 → 5103.00] want to do perfect electronics tools like we'd want to do uh you know tweezers and um pry tools and
[5103.00 → 5108.44] things like that like i could definitely see us we wouldn't be I don't think we'd want to compete
[5109.40 → 5114.60] at like a budget price point that's not really our brand I was just going to say having tweezers that
[5114.60 → 5120.60] you can like that aren't super and like kind of annoying to handle would be sweet yeah just like
[5120.60 → 5126.60] a really nice pair you know i it's I mean it's going to come down to pretty much stuff that I want to be
[5126.60 → 5134.12] better i i I hate most of the like needle nose pliers that I've ever used like a really nice pair of
[5134.12 → 5138.68] needle nose pliers yeah I'd be down I'd be down to do something like i I don't know we're we're
[5138.68 → 5145.48] going to see we're going to see uh Dylan can't says AirPods Pro have found my just use that to track them
[5145.48 → 5150.12] only works if they have battery yeah fun fact and if you had them paired to your iPhone if I recall
[5150.12 → 5153.40] correctly because I was trying to find them recently and I couldn't figure out how to do it from an android
[5153.40 → 5161.56] phone if you didn't have it paired to the iPhone do we have any other topics that we wanted to hit oh
[5162.12 → 5169.96] PCIE 7.0 was just announced, and it's going to be a fast one lady and gentlemen although PCIE 5 is
[5169.96 → 5175.48] just starting to trickle out into the real world the fine folks over at PCI sig have unveiled the specs for
[5175.48 → 5188.84] the PCIE 7.0 standard it's fast it'll do 512 gigabytes per second eight times the speed of PCIE 5.0
[5189.40 → 5196.92] really two times what PCIE 6 will bring so PCIE 6 is quadrupling speed instead of doubling this is
[5196.92 → 5203.80] madness of course 512 gigabytes a second will be for 16x connectors and in real life the performance won't be
[5203.80 → 5211.96] that high but what that means is a single PCIE 7.0 lane will give us the same bandwidth as a full-blown
[5211.96 → 5221.32] PCIE gen 4 16x slot wow PCIE 5.0 SSDs are just starting to come out with speeds of 13 gigabytes a
[5221.32 → 5228.92] second so maybe over 100 gigabytes a second could actually happen on a single SSD I mean Nan flash is
[5228.92 → 5236.28] going to have to come a long way before we're going to see anything like that but who knows man
[5236.28 → 5242.76] yeah Anthony writes if you could get an external GPU adapter like the beast NVMe thing to work with PCIE
[5242.76 → 5250.92] gen 7 that'd be hilarious you could run like a full fat desktop GPU full speed on your laptop like storage
[5250.92 → 5258.20] slot or if we saw you know a steam deck of the future with PCIE gen I mean even gen 5 or gen 6 by
[5258.20 → 5265.48] that point I worry that these generations of PCIE are not even really going to make their way into the
[5265.48 → 5273.88] consumer space though a don't need it no honestly we really don't need it and b I have to imagine
[5273.88 → 5280.84] that the power requirements just wouldn't make sense particularly for mobile I mean yeah Moore's law blah blah
[5280.84 → 5287.96] we're going to see more refined process node technology but you have to remember guys as we get more power
[5287.96 → 5295.80] efficient like gen 4 controllers are also going to get more power efficient so it might just not make
[5295.80 → 5302.52] any sense I mean we've already seen multiple mobile platforms not carry the same PCI Express generation
[5302.52 → 5308.44] compatibility as their desktop counterparts and like one of the things too is like by the time we might need
[5308.44 → 5313.56] it says we go like far enough out in the future and something crazy requires that type of stuff
[5313.56 → 5319.16] uh there's probably going to be gen whatever the heck way beyond what we're currently at so yeah i
[5319.16 → 5324.44] suspect the consumer space will skip quite a few gremlin injector says Linus this will improve efficiency
[5324.44 → 5332.92] imagine a CPU that only needs four PCIE lanes I mean I guess we'll see we'll see that's a good comment
[5332.92 → 5339.96] actually are you better off with lower power lanes or fewer higher power lanes will consumers
[5339.96 → 5345.64] revolt when intel an intel or an AMD releases a platform that has fewer lanes than the previous
[5345.64 → 5353.72] one because so far that hasn't been the trend I don't know uh someone brought up that we have not
[5353.72 → 5362.76] addressed the responding to critical topic oh right that's a whole big thing it's big so oh uh
[5362.92 → 5369.24] Sam our audio engineer for labs is off probation now so I can call him out by name oh and by the
[5369.24 → 5377.48] way clinical uh we also haven't received our 5128 uh we shot our video with a rental so after publishing
[5377.48 → 5383.32] our head and torso simulator video clinical had some thoughts who are critical is the man behind
[5383.32 → 5388.44] in-ear fidelity one of the most comprehensive IEM and headphone databases on the web he's one of the most
[5388.44 → 5392.52] prominent creators in the audiophile community and is well respected and very knowledgeable his
[5392.52 → 5398.28] channel is great if you guys want to go subscribe to him uh critical plus um especially since he had
[5398.28 → 5403.48] to restart his whole channel after losing it oh YouTube support was apparently useless uh his video
[5403.48 → 5408.28] compliments our video quite nicely filling in technical information gaps in our video that our
[5408.28 → 5415.16] audience we felt might not have been interested in since this was a LTT video not an in-depth deep
[5415.16 → 5421.56] dive on what could in the future be a lab specific channel you got to remember you can't just publish
[5421.56 → 5427.00] any old thing you want on any old random channel and expect it to perform well you have to try to meet
[5427.00 → 5433.16] the expectations of your audience regarding our video critical said that our current audio product
[5433.16 → 5437.72] reviews are kind of low level it's fair, but he thinks we're heading in the right direction and
[5437.72 → 5441.24] leads forward to our development he hopes that our influence will be good for the headphone industry in
[5441.24 → 5445.56] general he also thinks we made the right choice in head and torso simulator that's good to know because
[5445.56 → 5451.56] it wasn't cheap yeah he said our hats video was largely accurate but a little dubbed down to fit the
[5451.56 → 5460.76] mainstream viewer you are right I cut out so much stuff at first okay so first Sam cut out things knowing
[5460.76 → 5467.88] that it was headed to LTT then Adam the writer cut out a bunch of Sam's stuff knowing that it was headed to LTT
[5467.88 → 5475.48] then I took much of what Adam preserved and cut it out because we were trying to address a more
[5475.48 → 5481.64] mainstream audience so critical you're right he thinks we could have gone with a more cost-effective
[5481.64 → 5485.48] solution but given our resources and ambitions he understands our decision yeah we don't want to
[5486.04 → 5491.64] around like that's just not what labs are going to be does have advice and concerns for us don't waste
[5491.64 → 5496.44] time on certain tests and measurements that although they might be a staple of audio slash headphone
[5496.44 → 5501.48] measurements provide little useful information to the user examples include total harmonic distortion
[5501.48 → 5507.72] time domain measurements impulse response waterfall plots etc got it don't abandon this headphone
[5507.72 → 5511.72] database project after a while like some other websites have like headfi.org instead build a
[5511.72 → 5515.80] thorough and comprehensive database of headphones and continuously update it make sure it's feature
[5515.80 → 5520.76] rich and has powerful and flexible comparison tools and functions you ready that's the goal that is
[5520.76 → 5528.52] the goal, but it's going to take well Luke's hiring right now isn't he yeah, yeah sure am don't publish sound
[5528.52 → 5536.12] demos hmm interesting where you play samples of the audio output from each headphone for users to listen to
[5537.24 → 5542.76] critical says basically it would be like judging the colour accuracy of a TV while wearing coloured glasses so
[5542.76 → 5548.68] you can't really tell how each headphone would sound on your head it's only a relative comparison
[5548.68 → 5554.04] hmm this contains Sam's response which I have not read yet but I do have my own thoughts about that
[5554.04 → 5558.68] I will read Sam's response first we agree that frequency response sound demos are only valid for
[5558.68 → 5563.64] relative comparisons and not for absolute comparisons this makes frequency response sound demos quite
[5563.64 → 5568.84] confusing for the uninitiated if we decide to publish frequency response sound demos we will
[5568.84 → 5574.04] make sure that their limitations are very, very clear however there are other types of sound demos that can be
[5574.04 → 5580.28] quite useful like active noise cancellation or isolation sound demos as well as leakage and microphone headset
[5580.28 → 5585.80] sound demos critical approves of these last few yeah I mean I think this is something that I'm going to
[5585.80 → 5596.92] butt heads with the labs team about uh often because I do have an I do have a tendency to want to at least give
[5596.92 → 5605.56] people who don't understand technical documentation something to look at that might tell them something
[5605.56 → 5616.52] anything and some in some cases you can run into a situation where a product is so clearly obviously worse
[5616.52 → 5624.04] than another one that even a recording on a crappy microphone played through YouTube compression on dollar
[5624.04 → 5630.12] store earphones will tell you that this one is clearly better than the other one garbage in garbage out
[5631.64 → 5631.88] so
[5634.52 → 5642.68] I know that there will be situations where we are going to publish uh sound demos for example fan noise is
[5642.68 → 5649.16] something where quantitatively you can turn it into a numerical value you can represent it that way
[5649.16 → 5656.76] but qualitatively it's very difficult and so as I feel as long as we have a very consistent way of
[5656.76 → 5661.88] collecting those sound demos there's a value to that for the end user
[5663.48 → 5670.60] is there so something from my side would be like labs is trying to be as hardcore and objective as it can be
[5670.60 → 5676.28] is there value to the not everyone's going to understand this but like the like science
[5676.28 → 5681.16] local science museum I was going to say science world, but we can apply it to whatever one you have
[5682.20 → 5687.16] you know how you can like to walk up and press a button, and it like will give you like a kids level
[5688.36 → 5693.16] understanding of something like is there value to that like could we give people audio samples and
[5693.16 → 5699.08] just have like very blatant warnings and be like this is not objective I think that it could be valuable for
[5699.08 → 5707.64] things like um you know this is what more bass heavy a more bass heavy headphone might sound like
[5708.28 → 5714.12] or if we were to do something like a guide for how to wear your headphones properly which is a big deal
[5714.12 → 5719.56] like if you have a leak in a closed back headphone I mean good luck getting any bass response out of it right
[5719.56 → 5725.88] so uh if we had something like demos of here's what your headphones might sound like when they are not sealed correctly
[5725.88 → 5731.08] like this or here's what your headphone might sound like if you're wearing it too far forward I think
[5731.08 → 5735.80] something like that could have a ton of value but in that case you're comparing apples to apples you're
[5735.80 → 5739.16] only changing one variable at a time you're also hoping that they're wearing it properly in the first
[5739.16 → 5748.84] place well no because it's relative it is relative, so the recording would still reflect some of those changes
[5748.84 → 5754.36] it's just the recording of wearing it properly won't sound proper if they're not wearing it properly
[5756.20 → 5760.28] uh legit sue says Linus arguing with the very people he hired because he has no clue what he's
[5760.28 → 5765.08] talking about is confusing no you're the only one who's confused I'm not arguing with them, I'm saying
[5765.08 → 5772.36] that we are definitely going to have to find a middle ground where we are able to represent the
[5772.36 → 5783.40] differences between products in a way that armies can understand and while also staying true to our
[5783.40 → 5791.32] mission which is to provide objective empirical data and there has to be a very, very clear line between
[5791.32 → 5799.72] the two as well which is it going to be interesting um communicating results and things like that is very
[5799.72 → 5804.12] difficult snow skeleton over on float plane chat seems to understand a little better and says
[5804.12 → 5808.44] relative can still be valuable if you have a recording of a headset that I know and like
[5809.08 → 5813.80] and play the same sounds on a different set I can get some sense for the differences based on my
[5813.80 → 5819.56] knowledge of a previous set yeah it's not scientific at all, and frankly we wouldn't want you to make a
[5819.56 → 5825.72] purchase decision based on that I mean we could even just say that much it would have to be like super
[5825.72 → 5832.20] super clear I think disclaiming it um I think disclaiming it and just saying this is for you
[5832.20 → 5838.28] you basically go you go psychic on it, you say this is for entertainment purposes only this is the
[5838.28 → 5844.52] scientific data this is for entertainment purposes only I would be comfortable publishing it um at the
[5844.52 → 5848.76] end critical jokes that if our headphone test engineer insists on publishing sound demos we should
[5848.76 → 5852.60] fire him I had actually only just read that now so apparently maybe we should fire me
[5852.60 → 5858.04] um i you know it's one of those things where I understand both the purest point of view and i
[5858.04 → 5863.48] also understand the users who just want that resource whether it's a flawed data point or not
[5863.48 → 5868.68] and it feels honestly a lot like arguing with YouTube about the dislike button they say well it's not a
[5868.68 → 5873.88] good indicator of video quality and most users don't rely on it anyway because comments is so much better
[5873.88 → 5879.32] blah blah blah blah blah there's so much there's so much uh there's so much interpretation that needs to
[5879.32 → 5885.48] be done in order to utilize this signal that as an end user you couldn't possibly do it and I'm sitting
[5885.48 → 5892.20] here going I can do it just fine and I would like to have it I'm the end user I'm the customer I said i
[5892.20 → 5901.32] want it and so there's a push and there's a pull right we have to push what are the right measurements and
[5901.32 → 5907.24] what are the right means of representing the differences between products, but users are also
[5907.24 → 5914.60] going to tell us what resources they want, and it's very clear from chat that they want that resource
[5916.36 → 5922.28] and again we can do a lot in regard to segmenting it making it very, very clear like okay
[5922.28 → 5928.28] this section is for entertainment purposes only like you said um this is the actual like proper data
[5928.28 → 5937.08] dividing it all up yeah see legit says I would rather be presented with hard scientific data that
[5937.08 → 5941.24] this headphone is better than that headphone and let the subjective part which would be me the subject
[5941.24 → 5947.56] make the final decision, but it doesn't work that way so again you don't understand any single headphone
[5947.56 → 5955.48] is better objectively than another headphone you also don't have to go through the entertainment only
[5955.48 → 5962.36] section you can just read the hard facts section which is true but the the the thing that I want
[5962.36 → 5970.12] to clarify here is that we all are so different our physiology is so different that the best
[5970.12 → 5975.64] performing headphone for me is not necessarily the best performing headphone for you this is something
[5975.64 → 5983.96] that we did discuss in the video and the dummy head is it's an average it's designed based on an
[5983.96 → 5989.32] average of a bunch of people no one of those individual people was that average it's its
[5989.32 → 5995.88] literally just a nice to know figure that you're collecting from it there is no objectivity here
[5995.88 → 6006.28] that's the challenge uh note from bell this week's short circuit will have labs notes in it
[6006.28 → 6014.60] oh really or this weekend's this weekend yeah for the Mercedes EQS we have labs notes on the speaker
[6014.60 → 6019.40] system so if you want to see kind of how some of it will be presented and compared to other products
[6019.40 → 6021.72] that will be an option that's fun
[6025.64 → 6031.48] cool anyway i I think uh I haven't watched the video but from looking at the back and
[6031.48 → 6035.24] forth it sounds like both sides are super level-headed and there's some really cool feedback and that's
[6035.24 → 6042.52] awesome yeah it's actually really exciting to have like pinnacle figures of various industries
[6043.48 → 6048.12] stepping up and being excited about us doing this and giving advice as well because like
[6048.76 → 6052.36] yeah we're not we don't know everything and we want to make sure that we are taking the right
[6052.36 → 6054.84] and we'll make mistakes yeah
[6057.80 → 6061.72] Joshua says what is the priority for things to be tested in LTT labs
[6061.72 → 6068.20] whatever we can do well I've been asked this a lot internally as well like what are we what
[6068.20 → 6073.88] are we hiring for, and the answer is we're hiring the best people and whatever it is that they happen
[6073.88 → 6083.56] to be experts in well that's um what we're going to test first yeah it's just going to be that simple so we found an
[6083.56 → 6088.60] excellent candidate for audio uh we have an excellent candidate for keyboards um
[6090.92 → 6094.84] we have what else can I announce, yet you know what I'm going to leave it there for now I'll leave
[6094.84 → 6098.04] it there for now because those guys are off probation all right
[6101.08 → 6104.84] Andrew asks how do you like the ubiquity unify protect setup in your new house it looked like you
[6104.84 → 6109.96] went with two DVRs instead of a NVR pro why uh Jake set it up that way I believe it was just because
[6109.96 → 6116.92] of it being difficult to get our hands on a NVR pro um as for how much I like if it's very
[6116.92 → 6124.20] very, very expensive, but the benefit is that I'm very unlikely to get rug pulled later on and have
[6124.20 → 6129.40] functionality turned off if I refuse to pay for a subscription service, so there's no ongoing cost i
[6129.40 → 6134.92] it's its one time and forget about it also ubiquity is a great partner and didn't charge me for it so
[6134.92 → 6143.00] um there wasn't even that drawback, but the image quality is a lot it's so good and the app
[6143.00 → 6148.52] is getting better it's a lot better now than it was there's still definitely room for improvement
[6148.52 → 6156.12] but it's getting so much better, and it's happening at a very reasonable pace a good pace oh I guess you
[6156.12 → 6160.44] can read these now that you've kind of caught up on the incoming merch messages hey bill I did get a bit
[6160.44 → 6167.64] of a breather first uh one here is from Steve the industry seems to be moving towards arm processors
[6167.64 → 6172.60] what do you think this will do to old games max m1 Rosetta works good, but history says apple will
[6172.60 → 6180.52] axe it what do you think will happen in the pc space wow this is going to be one of those things that
[6180.52 → 6194.44] haunts me I think but in that context I don't see an end for x86 in gaming I know right how are you
[6194.44 → 6202.68] going to emulate x86 uh people have emulated other funky stuff yeah but how are you gonna play like
[6202.68 → 6210.84] freaking doom eternal I don't know I don't have an answer for you emulated like it's not
[6212.44 → 6216.60] maybe in PCIE gen 11 yeah like that's what I'm talking it might be that far ahead
[6217.56 → 6226.84] like I don't know I don't know yeah it's a little weird, but we'll see dash d asks oh sorry go ahead
[6226.84 → 6232.04] that's your job what's the best way to handle a hot pc in a room you can't air condition over the summer
[6232.04 → 6239.56] ducting yeah he's not wrong we should do a video on that have we not we haven't done a video on
[6239.56 → 6246.44] just like ducting and intake like man for under 50 bucks yeah pretty okay you can get some
[6246.44 → 6255.48] some ducting a fan some tape, and you can considerably cool your room in the summer and like if you do it
[6255.48 → 6260.76] properly like if you get actual ducting and stuff it won't even look like that bad it'll look pretty
[6260.76 → 6267.88] bad it's going to look bad if I do, but you can also do it with cardboard for basically nothing that will
[6267.88 → 6274.28] look bad yeah, but it'll work or do it Terran did and just have it outside your room like his intel
[6274.28 → 6285.48] upgrade video yeah that also works he's making a note room yeah yeah we're totally going to do that video
[6285.48 → 6293.64] uh while you type that down from Abraham sorry if that's wrong do you think it's a good idea to use
[6293.64 → 6298.20] port forwarding to remotely access my NAS if not is there a more secure way you can recommend
[6299.56 → 6305.08] I'll let Luke handle this one uh having open ports is generally not the best
[6305.08 → 6314.68] an alternative that I do not have it depends on how their NAS is set up um it depends on how they
[6314.68 → 6321.88] want to access it like there 's's there's a lot more that you would need I would need to know
[6321.88 → 6326.20] yeah try posting in our forum we have a lot of smart people that will definitely help you out yes
[6326.20 → 6332.92] from Samuel uh but yeah probably not the ports but yeah like it's
[6338.12 → 6342.92] I don't know any time you open it up at all there's going to be security problems which is
[6342.92 → 6350.84] why I don't really want to say something um but like removing in is a solution uh having a private VPN
[6350.84 → 6355.32] is a solution that's how a lot of companies do that type of stuff um if you're comfortable setting
[6355.32 → 6362.76] that up then sure yeah i just more secure my hesitation there was if you didn't already know
[6362.76 → 6367.80] that it might be hard uh, but there are guides on how to do that stuff I think you guys even have one
[6368.52 → 6373.40] uh so maybe watch the Ltd one uh last I looked at it is actually looked like it was still fairly up to
[6373.40 → 6380.84] date so maybe check that out um but yeah most companies do VPNs and whatever you do don't take
[6380.84 → 6392.12] advice from YouTube chat where uh Mr sharpies over there says DMZ the Nazi nice let's go let's go
[6396.04 → 6402.12] please no but yeah it depends on it depends on what you want to do with it, I would argue like if you're
[6402.12 → 6406.84] if you're trying to play music on your phone anywhere in the world it might need to be a little bit more
[6406.84 → 6411.96] open ITECH cat asks with Linus's workstation as a rack server in his rack at home to draw the
[6411.96 → 6415.88] noise and heat away from where he works in games does that mean he could just log into his workstation
[6415.88 → 6420.60] from different stations like one day in the office next from the comfort of his bed okay so the way
[6420.60 → 6429.16] that's set up is with optical display port and USB connections for that reason yes I could access it
[6429.16 → 6436.36] from anywhere but only wherever I ran optical display port and optical USB because otherwise I am
[6436.36 → 6442.28] limited by the bandwidth, and realistically it's not really a bandwidth limitation it's an
[6442.28 → 6451.56] encoding and decoding uh performance limitation of Ethernet right so typically when you remote into
[6451.56 → 6459.88] a station at best you're doing like maybe 60 megabits per second if you're using van for encoding yeah and
[6459.88 → 6465.48] it's costing you about a frame at 60 fps of time for that encode and decode process
[6466.52 → 6472.12] plus network transit time so it's going to be blocky you're not going to have support for advanced
[6472.12 → 6478.12] features like VR or HDR or anything like that so yeses you can access the station from anywhere but
[6478.12 → 6484.04] that's just that's basically parsec so at home what I'm doing is I'm using USB and DisplayPort and
[6484.04 → 6489.40] thunderbolt to have it be exactly like I'm sitting right in front of it there's no additional latency and no
[6489.40 → 6495.48] quality loss so it's a pretty different solution tony b in full plane chat said if you do use a VPN
[6495.48 → 6500.60] still secure the services if it was exposed to the internet the VPN is in addition to that security
[6500.60 → 6505.16] not in place of it that so that's what I'm kind of saying like the second you start accessing it
[6505.16 → 6513.08] remotely you open yourself to security concerns that's just it's just how it is my dude so yeah I'm
[6513.08 → 6517.80] not saying you necessarily shouldn't do it um but yeah
[6521.24 → 6524.76] from Eric what happened to the one million dollar computer series
[6526.60 → 6529.00] Jake was busy helping me finish my house
[6531.64 → 6537.24] so are they going to ask for it back yeah yeah it's going back at some point but uh Jake needs to finish
[6537.24 → 6542.84] working on it, I think he actually did put some work into it this week but nice um he's been covering
[6542.84 → 6547.80] for someone else this week as well so I don't think he put in as much work on it as he wanted to
[6547.80 → 6552.28] hopefully we'll shoot another segment next week with like some actual benchmarks
[6554.20 → 6559.72] from Alexander how have the creases been on your fold I have mine, and it's getting horrible crease
[6559.72 → 6563.24] marks and the screen protector they say not to remove is starting to tear and crease
[6563.24 → 6571.72] funny you asked Luke what do you see at the top of my screen oh it's starting to bubble out yeah this
[6571.72 → 6577.64] just happened you can actually probably see it from there yep it just started to separate in the last
[6579.72 → 6586.76] maybe couple of weeks so it made it a long time I didn't even think the screen protector was
[6586.76 → 6592.68] removable to be honest with you, I thought it was a permanent part of the display, but it appears to be
[6593.24 → 6597.96] not because you can kind of see it coming away at the bottom here to that's pretty rough should I
[6597.96 → 6602.76] try and peel it off all the way, or you know are you able to do that i I remember hearing very early
[6602.76 → 6607.88] on in this device's life that people didn't realize that it was actually like a part of the screen and
[6607.88 → 6612.44] they peeled it off, and it broke things I thought it was the second gen one maybe I don't know actually
[6612.44 → 6620.92] can't remember twitch chat obviously is like yes now yeah I think I'll wait for someone a little more
[6620.92 → 6629.56] level-headed to to to pitch in here should we do we have the new thing the polling system no oh all
[6629.56 → 6636.68] right well never mind people are like yeah yeah float planes like no do not web versions done but
[6636.68 → 6643.64] when you stop no it's not removable don't well that sucks then because it's going to get to the point
[6643.64 → 6650.04] of not being very pleasant to use like this is clearly visible oh that's terrible actually yeah
[6650.04 → 6655.56] yeah like it's its off uh okay that one's kind of hard to see from there but I don't like the worst
[6655.56 → 6661.80] bump yeah I can it's yeah yeah it's like having an awful notch yeah or notch there we go yeah yeah
[6663.40 → 6671.48] if you do it on stream all right forget it I mean that for sure on that one from Michelle
[6671.48 → 6677.40] Linus do you still like the unified doorbell you had installed at your old house that was a latency
[6677.40 → 6681.32] do you have any experience with any other smart doorbells I don't have experience with other ones
[6681.32 → 6686.12] but what I know about the unify one is that it doesn't upload the comings and goings at my house
[6686.12 → 6692.68] to anyone else and I like that I can the latency is I don't know it's usable usually I can catch people
[6692.68 → 6698.52] before they leave the door but as always it depends on your mobile data connection the feature that
[6698.52 → 6704.44] was missing at the beginning that drove me crazy is the ability to replay with one touch the person
[6704.44 → 6710.12] coming and going so a lot of the time if I took is I took 30 seconds to get to the notification I would
[6710.12 → 6714.52] have to go painstakingly scrub and try and find the exact moment that someone came to the door and
[6714.52 → 6719.64] it wasn't very good at expanding and shrinking the timeline back then, but it's perfect now so you can
[6719.64 → 6724.76] either look at it live and talk to them immediately, or you can go back to the event and just
[6724.76 → 6727.64] see what it was because a lot of the time it's just someone coming up bringing the doorbell leaving a
[6727.64 → 6733.24] package and going from Micah we've actually gotten this question a few times do you have any thoughts
[6733.24 → 6740.76] on the matter smart home ecosystem yeah i i I'm super stoked on it, but there's just it's not ready
[6740.76 → 6745.72] yet so for all the good it does me I mean that's the thing about technology right is you can keep
[6745.72 → 6750.20] waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting for the next big thing around the corner
[6750.20 → 6755.56] or at some point you just have to buy something and enjoy it so that's what I decided to do I went
[6755.56 → 6763.48] I went Z-Wave, and we'll see how that goes yeah there was a there was a question in here that
[6763.48 → 6767.72] that I don't know what happened to it, but it was asking me if I would ever consider building a mineral
[6767.72 → 6775.48] machine again um and I wanted to address that because I'm still thinking of ideas but if my name ever gets
[6775.48 → 6784.52] drawn in the intel extreme thing I was thinking of making Linus build another mineral machine as
[6785.40 → 6790.76] as a joke I've been actually considering it just because I think it would be so funny
[6792.12 → 6800.20] we have the facilities to probably do it as well as Puget or better now with the workshop and
[6800.20 → 6807.96] everything like it could actually be pretty sick um so I've been considering it but like I'm far from
[6807.96 → 6813.24] dedicating to it and I mean my name would have to be drawn and there's kind of a few people that work
[6813.24 → 6820.76] here now so it is mean it my name might just never be drawn so it might also just not happen um yeah
[6823.00 → 6829.80] yes definitely do that by the way somebody suggested a desk mineral oil pc so you can just combine both
[6829.80 → 6837.08] of Linus's least favourite types of builds oh no the amount of places that that could start leaking
[6842.36 → 6849.72] no not that one of the really nice things about fish tanks is you usually try to find ones that are
[6849.72 → 6858.12] that are solid piece on the bottom so that there isn't like a seal point um that's often a
[6858.12 → 6865.40] a very notable benefit use 3m novel I mean I guess if I'm getting the company to pay for it, I don't think
[6865.40 → 6871.48] you'll be able to afford it probably not in that, but it's so expensive crazy expense there are some
[6871.48 → 6879.24] other alternative stuff these days um that that isn't as expensive as novel i would dive into
[6879.24 → 6886.12] it is more if we were actually doing it but yeah from erode have you guys heard anything about e-lea poled
[6886.12 → 6893.40] technology that came out about a month or so ago no but I saw this merch message ahead of time so I pulled up an article
[6893.40 → 6901.00] about it apparently it's from Japan display inc it allows much, much brighter olds and with better
[6901.00 → 6906.92] longevity, and apparently it's not just a lab experiment this is actual display technology that
[6906.92 → 6912.36] they are ready to start shipping sooner rather than later it sounds really exciting sounds like between
[6912.36 → 6919.88] cutie OLED from Samsung and LG juicing up their existing OLED and Japan display um unveiling this new
[6919.88 → 6925.72] method of making OLED TVs that things are about to get competition's about to get fierce which is
[6925.72 → 6931.24] always good it's good for pricing for the consumer very good so I'm jacked
[6933.56 → 6937.72] from Aaron hello Linus and Luke hope the new house construction is going smoothly
[6937.72 → 6942.52] what are your thoughts on manufacturing or manufactured moving to smart bulbs and internet
[6942.52 → 6949.24] of things in terms of cybersecurity it's bad but I want to try it like a problem so I'm going to do it
[6950.28 → 6950.68] basically
[6953.48 → 6956.52] iot botnets iot botnets
[6960.68 → 6968.04] uh from Christopher have you seen all the new stuff from AYA the slide neo2 flip etc uh yes i uh oh what can
[6968.04 → 6979.64] I say yes, yes what's the flip oh they're they're doing so much right now I cannot figure out how
[6979.64 → 6984.92] they have all the money they need to work on all these projects uh they've got an Indiegogo
[6984.92 → 6991.00] campaign going right now for oh which one is it I can't remember which one, but there's a there's a
[6991.00 → 6997.64] campaign running right now I'll just check my clamshell windows handheld interesting yeah they've
[6997.64 → 7002.92] got some really cool stuff going on right now is it dual screen I'm not seeing very good pictures
[7002.92 → 7008.20] yeah the air is the one they have an Indiegogo campaign it's funded already as far as I can tell
[7008.20 → 7014.04] it's less about actually getting funding and more about taking pre-orders and marketing and all that
[7014.04 → 7019.80] kind of stuff the air looks pretty sick looking forward to checking that out I think they should
[7019.80 → 7023.80] start doing it on their own site so they can stop paying Indiegogo for doing almost nothing but
[7023.80 → 7031.88] that's just my opinion kitty in float plane chat says hey Linus and Luke hear me out solid block
[7031.88 → 7039.96] of acrylic machined out I was I've had a lot of funky ideas i was thinking potentially even custom
[7039.96 → 7049.64] glass can you get a solid block of acrylic probably I don't know solid acrylic blocks I mean here
[7049.64 → 7056.04] lets uh let's learn shall we I mean that thing looks big I don't know I can never I can never tell
[7056.60 → 7064.20] this is one by one inch like I want a big one like that would be heavy you know at a certain point
[7065.64 → 7074.76] even just you know cheap crappy acrylic or whatever gets heavy Lucite block okay this is all just like
[7074.76 → 7084.92] cute little decorative stuff okay large acrylic block acrylic cylinders up to eight feet in
[7084.92 → 7094.60] size now we're talking oh nope that's not quite what I had in mind okay then I don't know what came up
[7094.60 → 7096.60] acrylic blocks out water
[7099.00 → 7110.36] mm-hmm okay well those are like windows or something clear extra large block well clearly this requires a
[7110.36 → 7115.80] little bit more work than what I was willing to put into it live acrylic can apparently also be cast
[7115.80 → 7126.76] cool all right as a follow-up to the mania question and you pulling it out earlier have you
[7126.76 → 7137.08] still been using the steam deck I prefer the IAN neo I like the smaller more compact shape of it one
[7137.08 → 7143.00] thing that's really cool about the steam deck though is the way that the thermal mod that we did on it
[7143.00 → 7149.88] unlocks extra performance that was pretty sick but yes I've been using the IAN neo pro um
[7151.64 → 7157.16] I forget is that what this one's called ian neo next pro sorry that's the that's the one that
[7157.16 → 7162.44] I've been using and a big part of it honestly is that I'm just lazy I don't like setting things up more
[7162.44 → 7168.60] than once and the OS drive that I have in there is one of those eight terabyte warrant ones so I can
[7168.60 → 7177.24] just dump absolutely everything onto it emulated games steam games whatever it's all just dumped
[7177.24 → 7182.52] onto here I never have to think about it, I don't set it up again i just each IAN neo I just pull it
[7182.52 → 7191.32] out and put it into the next one that's pretty sweet so I got a system here that's cool in that same beat
[7191.32 → 7195.64] uh there was a question for Luke did you cancel your steam deck pre-order or have you been tempted
[7195.64 → 7203.56] by AYA products um I actually have been tempted by AYA products for some like thing reasons that
[7203.56 → 7208.12] honestly shouldn't necessarily matter too much but I think aesthetically they just look awesome
[7208.12 → 7215.56] um like that retro one you showed off yeah was so cool like i it was just sweet they're just kind of
[7215.56 → 7222.84] nerds they are geeks or whatever the right term you can tell yeah just awesome um I have not
[7222.84 → 7229.72] cancelled it at this point I'm not feeling super motivated to buy but I've had a bunch of friends
[7229.72 → 7236.12] say like hey like I would like to pay the purchase cost if you could get it for me and I'm like okay well
[7236.12 → 7242.44] I'll hold my reservation um I'm not going to like you're going to scalp it no you're going to scalp it no I'm not
[7242.44 → 7249.40] going to you're going to be a filthy dirty rotten ugly awful stinky scalper we got a little specific
[7249.40 → 7255.08] there at the end uh no but i I might like you know I don't think you're ugly yeah, thank you
[7256.12 → 7262.60] it's appreciated um but yeah it's very likely I'll hand it off to someone else in my life that was
[7262.60 → 7268.60] unable to get uh a reservation, so yeah yeah don't scalp but just know I will pay double
[7272.84 → 7279.40] bell you're part of the problem officially sorry uh from Keith is there any recent books you've read
[7279.40 → 7287.00] and enjoyed for either of you I don't find nearly enough time to read I read a lot of articles i I keep
[7287.00 → 7294.68] up with world events a lot more than I used to, but my problem with reading is that the second I start
[7294.68 → 7303.40] something i it's unlikely that I will sleep until I finish it, and so I'm afraid to pick up new books
[7304.04 → 7311.72] because it kind of destroys my life for a couple of days I know that's like a really horrible cop-out
[7311.72 → 7319.16] stupid response to that but I don't read much fiction for that reason I'm gonna also cop out
[7319.16 → 7323.88] slightly but I will give two books um these were uh
[7329.48 → 7335.48] Tyler and I used to share book recommendations back in the day um and these were my two favourite
[7335.48 → 7343.64] ones that he ever suggested to me one of them is uprooted by uh Naomi Novak and the other one is
[7343.64 → 7352.68] bars the elephant's graveyard by Lauren Lawrence m shown uh those were those are some of the first
[7352.68 → 7356.28] books that he ever recommended to me, and they are both fantastic I'd highly recommend them
[7356.28 → 7364.84] oh Matthew b says I took the protector off my fold three due to the same issue it's basically
[7364.84 → 7370.36] just a normal protector just take it off slow it's nothing inbuilt that ruins the display
[7372.36 → 7380.76] should I go for it YOLO do it if we'll do it live yeet okay we ready uh oh I guess uh do you need a
[7380.76 → 7386.12] tool do you need something to help um you're just going to go at it, I think I'm just going to go at it, I mean
[7386.12 → 7391.80] there's enough of a gap there I feel like I can just get a fingernail in it, you know whoa wait a
[7391.80 → 7399.72] second did you hear that sound when I opened it I didn't do you hear that like there that sound
[7400.28 → 7406.28] the whole thing came off whoa look at that there's a whole line that is separated down the middle that
[7406.28 → 7409.56] just happened so it's its like sticking
[7409.56 → 7417.88] oh wow that's super audible when you put it up to the yeah maybe it wasn't so much that I heard it
[7417.88 → 7424.44] as that I felt it when I did it so uh here hold on I'm just gonna I'll turn so you guys can see if it
[7425.08 → 7426.76] busts it then you'll be the first to know
[7426.76 → 7437.96] okay oh that's yeah that's no problem that appears to be just a screen protector I'm
[7437.96 → 7442.28] kind of impressed it lasted this long then yeah well where do I get a new one now like
[7442.28 → 7446.36] does Samsung make this screen protector available because it's pretty good it actually feels very
[7446.36 → 7452.52] glass-like honestly I think i kind of like the feel of the screen protector better than the screen itself
[7452.52 → 7464.36] here try out both yeah it feels like uh smoother almost yeah I don't know why maybe there's some
[7464.36 → 7469.72] adhesive on the screen or something I know I don't think so it's just it's just it's a very plastique
[7469.72 → 7473.08] screen because it's not glass yeah yeah yeah makes sense interesting
[7475.96 → 7481.16] all right oh hey it looks uh looks nice and clean now so that's cool
[7481.16 → 7487.48] we'll bring up some content here oh got some Bob's burgers you know I haven't seen the movie yet
[7487.48 → 7491.88] I'm going to go see there's a movie yeah there's a bob's burgers movie I did not know yeah Bob's
[7491.88 → 7498.92] burgers sound like a moment right now all right from I blow it sports in a recent video you mentioned
[7498.92 → 7503.80] you sleep with your earbuds in, and you've mentioned it today as well uh I do the same with my Sony xm4
[7503.80 → 7508.44] earbuds tell me fall asleep with audiobooks are you concerned at all about long-term hearing loss about
[7508.44 → 7518.68] using headphones while sleeping oh, oh specifically i whatever asks mentions um noise cancellation um
[7520.60 → 7525.80] no I can't say I've ever had any concerns about that I haven't noticed any problems up until now
[7525.80 → 7534.60] I don't turn them up that's for sure and I don't think that they would be counteracting any strong
[7534.60 → 7542.04] sound waves coming in if I'm just sleeping with them to be perfectly honest with you, I have thought
[7542.04 → 7548.36] about before and meant to research it and I do not know the answer to whether active
[7548.36 → 7553.32] noise cancellation you know when so you've got the wave right and then you've got the wave that cancels
[7553.32 → 7559.96] it out whether it actually mitigates any damage that would be done to your ear by a very loud noise i
[7559.96 → 7564.60] don't I don't know the answer to that um maybe someone else does
[7567.48 → 7572.76] uh seems like it would be fine something I'd throw in there is because we're just because we're talking
[7572.76 → 7578.44] about like not a doctor hearing loss and stuff like that something that I've been concerned about uh
[7579.24 → 7588.20] is the buddies they can sometimes be really loud yeah um and they sit like right next to me all the
[7588.20 → 7594.04] time um so I've started to be concerned about that I might be looking into I don't want to because i
[7594.04 → 7599.48] love my headphones but I might be looking into like closed back headphones or something to try to like
[7599.48 → 7608.44] isolate from the freaking birds budgies uh they're often fine but when they're like real amped
[7608.44 → 7613.88] up for whatever reason on some day, and they're just like sometimes when I call they're just like
[7613.88 → 7622.68] like oh my goodness yeah, yeah so when they're in like that mood um it is yeah i I get a little
[7622.68 → 7628.20] concerned because I think they can go up to like 70 decibels oh I would say they're probably higher than
[7628.20 → 7633.72] that yeah I don't know um
[7633.72 → 7644.60] um I'm going to look it up budgies' oh apparently yeah about 70. About 70 yeah wow lovebirds all hit 83.
[7644.60 → 7650.52] some birds can get really up there I mean they gotta get that love out there you know
[7650.52 → 7656.44] i think the luck with the budgie is it's literally too small to produce any more noise
[7656.44 → 7662.44] it's its like physically incapable they weigh 30 grams like there's only so much they can accomplish
[7663.00 → 7670.36] uh yeah wow all right question here from Alex Linus have you made a decision on your main TV
[7670.36 → 7676.76] and your gaming monitor yet have you looked at the Sony a95k ah there will be a video on that very soon
[7676.76 → 7688.20] I can spoil it for you a little the Sony is really, really nice like wow really nice one of the one of
[7688.20 → 7694.84] my pro arts died one of my like ancient school pro really yeah so one of them's still working and
[7694.84 → 7700.60] then my like main gaming monitor is obviously fine yeah one of the pro arts is out and I don't like
[7700.60 → 7706.20] being down to two monitors so I've been trying to figure out like do I like splurge get a new gaming
[7706.20 → 7711.72] monitor do you go big do I go big do you go multiple do I get a third again if I get a third
[7711.72 → 7717.32] if like I could cheap out and just buy like another 24-inch 1080p monitor for like nothing and just get
[7717.32 → 7724.04] a third monitor up again that's probably fine like I'll do that's probably what I'll do because I was
[7724.04 → 7729.16] thinking about upgrading the gaming monitor but I honestly like it has all the features that i really
[7729.16 → 7735.96] want right now I like 1440p gaming five hertz isn't it yeah yeah 165 hertz 1440p they have 4k
[7735.96 → 7744.04] 240s now I can't run most games at that anyway no one can samsung uh has a display that'll do
[7744.04 → 7750.68] 4k 240 hertz I'm sitting here going sweet what's that for what can run that yeah exactly so like i
[7750.68 → 7757.24] i I think I still feel like my monitor is still at kind of sweet spot I have really liked 1440p and
[7757.24 → 7764.12] really high refresh rate so it's fine so yeah I'll probably just buy a cheap extra monitor but yeah just
[7764.12 → 7770.92] wait until you see the cutie OLED monitors yeah spoil you forever yeah really nice yeah but then
[7770.92 → 7776.92] like those aren't really a thing you know yeah there's only one yeah so like I think now is not the
[7776.92 → 7784.12] time yeah uh from kyle hi Linus what do you think about electric motorcycles like the zero lineup any
[7784.12 → 7791.80] chance we'll see them on LTT or short circuit I wanted to like the zero motorbike that I went and test
[7791.80 → 7797.08] drove um here hold on I'm going to bring it up and I'll see if I can, I'll see if I can find the one i
[7797.08 → 7804.20] test drove i I think you know we've gotten to the point where range has gotten reasonable enough that
[7804.20 → 7810.44] they make sense I think that zero has some models that look really cool this is the SRS I believe it
[7810.44 → 7816.76] was like a year ago or two years ago model that i tried, but this was basically the one that i
[7816.76 → 7827.00] test drove it is wicked fast um where's the actual where's the actual specs here 140 foot pounds of torque
[7827.00 → 7838.76] 110 horsepower there's an upgrade to a 17 17.3 kilowatt-hour battery uh where's the acceleration top speed
[7838.76 → 7844.60] 124 miles an hour you do not need to go faster than that I will tell you that many ladies and gentlemen
[7844.60 → 7852.76] full specs do they have like a zero to 60 or anything like that in here range oh my goodness
[7852.76 → 7858.04] where's your zero to 60 why do you not have a zero to 60 like front and centre the only reason I can
[7858.04 → 7867.32] think of is because maybe it's bad, but the point is its very torque I actually walked into the I walked
[7867.32 → 7873.80] into the dealership like with the money already funding secured you know like I had a combination of cash
[7873.80 → 7879.96] debit and credit that would allow me to just buy one walk out that day and I was going to just do
[7879.96 → 7885.00] it and Ivan was like okay you need to test drive it I'm like no, no it's cool, and my bike is like it
[7885.00 → 7890.60] needs a bunch of work and I just want to sell it and start over with something fresh I want to go
[7890.60 → 7894.68] electric I want to be able to just like to charge the bike not go to the gas station I hate going to the
[7894.68 → 7899.24] gas station on the bike it's just a hassle because it's got all your gear and everything it just sucks
[7899.24 → 7904.52] um so I was like yeah I'm going to do it electric motorcycle she's like you need to test drive it
[7904.52 → 7908.28] like I didn't make an appointment I'm just gonna I'll just buy it okay turns out one of the people
[7908.28 → 7912.20] who worked there one of the sales representatives was a fan was like we'll find you an appointment
[7912.20 → 7917.80] because this was peak covet times right so it must have been a year ago and uh yeah yeah to book
[7917.80 → 7921.40] everything in advance and there's only three people allowed in the store and blah blah blah blah blah or
[7921.40 → 7928.52] whatever right so I take it out for the ride, and they put it in the equivalent of chill mode I don't know
[7928.52 → 7933.64] that's the tesla terminology for it, but basically it's not like super crazy torque they put it in
[7933.64 → 7939.96] chill mode and I'm riding down the road and I'm like wow this is really soulless it's like boring
[7939.96 → 7944.68] so I turn it up to whatever the next notch is and then turn up another notch, and it's just
[7947.56 → 7947.96] sucks
[7950.60 → 7958.36] so I got back to the dealership um where they were expecting to take my money for a bike
[7958.36 → 7965.56] and instead I booked an appointment to bring in my SV uh sv650s uh it's 2003 it's nothing special
[7965.56 → 7973.48] it's worth like nothing now um to bring in my sv650s and spend more than it's actually worth
[7974.04 → 7980.60] on just getting it full new tires new chain just I needed a bunch of stuff brought it in got it
[7980.60 → 7985.96] done up and I've been happily riding it this season so glad that I did not go for an electric bike
[7985.96 → 7991.96] i just I can't, it's I'm not even I'm not even a Motörhead I'm not even like
[7994.20 → 8002.20] I don't I don't I don't need that stuff but it just oh I drive a volt for crying out loud
[8003.00 → 8010.84] i I just couldn't do it I couldn't do it last question here from Oliver and again a few other
[8010.84 → 8015.32] people surprisingly what was the motivation behind switching from Google Workspace to teams for
[8015.32 → 8021.08] communication leg well google kept telling us hangouts was going to go away, and it's still not
[8021.08 → 8026.28] gone they're still it even seems like they're pushing it they've they've added development have
[8026.28 → 8032.68] you have seen this crap look at this okay I go to share something watch this I go to share and I'm like Gmail
[8032.68 → 8040.12] oh okay well oh wait what just happened not what was that that doesn't matter the point is i
[8040.12 → 8046.04] go to share something okay watch this I click Gmail it's like do you mean Gmail chat no I don't mean
[8046.04 → 8052.68] chat I mean Gmail you even have a separate icon for Gmail chat you saw it i swear you saw it next
[8052.68 → 8059.08] to it before right the Gmail chat one sure yes like no why are you adding an extra click I'm trying to
[8059.08 → 8068.04] email something you are not chat any more you told me you're not chat anymore and like the the the way
[8068.04 → 8072.68] that google has dealt with their chat systems like part of this question is would you consider
[8072.68 → 8080.12] switching back it's like no trust them yeah exactly um because like moving an entire company to a new
[8080.12 → 8088.92] chat system is like really frustrating and genuinely has a cost to it um it's like no you don't really
[8088.92 → 8097.96] want to do that um would I have suggested teams no well you tried slack, and it was a nightmare
[8097.96 → 8103.56] I don't understand i I was not getting notifications I was not getting notifications for teams i literally
[8103.56 → 8108.52] showed you a screenshot I know that I got a notification on teams 172 days late I have a
[8108.52 → 8114.76] screenshot of this it literally says in the thing like how long ago did this message come in 172d as in
[8114.76 → 8124.84] days teams is a joke dumpster fire yes it is I know, but we tried slack, and it didn't work so I don't
[8124.84 → 8129.08] know what to tell you we've also had a lot of notifications from with slack I would say that
[8129.08 → 8134.52] recently it's been a lot better um but yeah we had notification problems a lot in the past as well
[8135.24 → 8140.92] um yeah lapsed memory says google had such a head start in the collab workspace and they just
[8140.92 → 8150.76] squandered it really it wasn't that long ago that Office 365 was a joke and now does anyone use
[8150.76 → 8158.20] anything else yeah yeah it's the same kind of thing with like MSN messenger like Microsoft had discord
[8159.64 → 8167.32] and not just discord Microsoft had like MySpace and Facebook too MSN messenger had a social
[8167.32 → 8174.76] network yeah yeah they had everything they could have owned everything like actually they just
[8174.76 → 8184.92] tossed it I meanwhile we're at it June oh yeah yeah and I think that's it for the show today
