[0.00 --> 8.60]  welcome to the wan show we have a fantastic show lined up for you guys today with hot topics
[8.60 --> 17.54]  including ubisoft ubisoft they went so long without us having anything too negative to say about them
[17.54 --> 22.64]  the whole nft thing okay that was pretty bad well anyway it's even worse this week they're
[22.64 --> 29.20]  decommissioning online services for a number of their old games with no alternatives to be seen
[29.20 --> 35.72]  we'll be talking about that alongside just i mean i guess just the state of gaming in general you can't
[35.72 --> 41.50]  talk about games getting decommissioned without also talking about how much it costs to pay for
[41.50 --> 51.78]  these gaming experiences that are so so fleeting uh in other news an m.2 macbook pro teardown confirms
[51.78 --> 58.76]  it is basically an m1 did i say m.2 you did an m2 macbook pro teardown confirms it's
[58.76 --> 67.90]  basically an m1 except you if you wanted to uh oh i don't know just reuse that chassis and change
[67.90 --> 73.32]  the logic board so we'll be talking a little bit more about that later uh youtube is just randomly
[73.32 --> 79.14]  deciding that definitely adult content is actually for kids and it's flagging it for kids and it's
[79.14 --> 87.42]  giving it to kids so that's bad also nvidia is unable to back out of tsmc orders because actually
[87.42 --> 94.66]  yes your sales numbers were inflated by mining yes they were uh yes they were oh and i'm gonna have
[94.66 --> 102.10]  an update on the whole youtube spam comment situation i have i have been personally contacted by
[102.10 --> 108.62]  more than one youtube employee about my comments from last week so we'll be chatting about that as well
[108.62 --> 109.34]  interesting
[109.34 --> 137.12]  the show is brought to you today by graphis zoho desk and vulture why don't we jump right into our
[137.12 --> 144.56]  first topic this was actually flagged for me by a viewer unfortunately i'm sorry i i i didn't save
[144.56 --> 149.76]  your tweet and i i forget which one it was but thank you they asked me whether i play anno 2070 because
[149.76 --> 157.68]  that's one of the games that ubisoft is decommissioning the online services for uh here's uh here's a quote
[157.68 --> 164.24]  here closing the online services for some older games allows us to focus our services on delivering
[164.24 --> 169.90]  great experiences for players who are playing newer or more popular titles and some of the ones that
[169.90 --> 177.54]  are being booted include anno 2070 assassin's creed 2 3 brotherhood liberation hd and revelations
[177.54 --> 183.90]  far cry 3 and space junkies it's a lot more than that too it is a lot more than that do you want to
[183.90 --> 190.30]  actually pull up oh yes this this topic definitely needs a look at the ubisoft website because the the
[190.30 --> 195.26]  notes are not i've got it um but yeah you can kind of scroll through the games i think you listed a
[195.26 --> 199.16]  lot of these first ones and there's driver san francisco ghost recon future soldier prince of
[199.16 --> 207.46]  persia forgotten sands for them right now etc etc now we did some we did some pre-show digging
[207.46 --> 214.00]  we looked through some stuff there's some oddities in here uh i think what ubisoft is really trying to
[214.00 --> 219.38]  communicate to people is that their own platforms are absolutely the worst and if you ever want to play
[219.38 --> 225.14]  an ubisoft game you should play it anywhere else ever or just don't play an ubisoft game um the
[225.14 --> 230.60]  reason for that as you can you can dive through here and see all of this if you scroll down to
[230.60 --> 236.52]  splinter cell blacklist there's something really interesting if you look at what happens to pc it
[236.52 --> 243.30]  says you are unable to play multiplayer link ubisoft accounts in game or use online services if you look at
[243.30 --> 248.90]  splinter cell blacklist for console blacklist for console it doesn't say you can't play multiplayer
[248.90 --> 255.52]  that is a consistent theme throughout pretty much all of this if the multiplayer is handled by
[255.52 --> 265.10]  consoles it's fine if it's handled by you play you can't do it anymore and that is trash and literally
[265.10 --> 269.92]  just means you're bad so stop doing it start putting your games on like steam or something and
[269.92 --> 275.32]  if you're going to decom something decom you play because it's garbage you are the worst one out of all
[275.32 --> 281.64]  of them give up worse than origin yes okay all right i mean what's what's what's what's what does
[281.64 --> 287.84]  you play do better than origin well download rates are faster on origin origin's actually stable i don't
[287.84 --> 297.94]  think ea has decommed games off of it origin the platform is better than like ea games okay let me be
[297.94 --> 304.80]  let me play devil's advocate here okay okay if i am ubisoft and i have specific infrastructure set
[304.80 --> 309.84]  up to run multiplayer for these games that functionally nobody is playing multiplayer that
[309.84 --> 315.80]  takes borderline no maintenance but but who plays zero server space i'm trying to play devil's advocate
[315.80 --> 320.96]  you're making it very difficult okay i'm advocating for the devil so you gotta at least let me talk
[320.96 --> 326.82]  okay i have to maintain these online services that are specific to these to these games to these
[326.82 --> 333.28]  titles um functionally no one is playing them i mean who who is playing assassin's creed 2
[333.28 --> 338.76]  multiplayer probably no one literally probably nobody is playing assassin's creed 2 i would argue there are
[338.76 --> 347.20]  alternatives okay can i can i finish luke i want to advocate for the devil here okay okay i have a hard
[347.20 --> 353.38]  enough job as it is without you interrupting constantly why wouldn't i take those resources
[353.38 --> 359.98]  and reallocate them as a developer as someone who leads a development team what is pretty much the
[359.98 --> 371.80]  worst sorry really really mature what is literally the worst like anchor that drags back current development
[371.80 --> 379.08]  uh yeah like just code rot maintenance maintenance like that maintenance for sure and are there potential
[379.08 --> 385.48]  security concerns with having these services running when they are not being maintained probably very
[385.48 --> 391.86]  minor ones but probably yes probably okay so devil's advocate is it not in the best interest of the
[391.86 --> 398.12]  current game player base that they discontinue these services for older games that nobody is playing the
[398.12 --> 406.22]  best interest that they don't do anything i'm advocating i don't what am i supposed to do i don't
[406.22 --> 412.90]  think this is an extensive amount of work to be completely honest considering as far as i can tell the console
[412.90 --> 420.68]  maintainers just don't care at all because like if if ubisoft and we'll talk about uh not caring at
[420.68 --> 425.96]  all a little bit more later when we start talking about space junkies specifically uh but but if ubisoft is
[425.96 --> 430.14]  discontinuing uh discontinuing support for multiplayer you think the consoles would be like oh sweet we
[430.14 --> 436.44]  get to drop it too as far as i can tell they genuinely don't care because it is such a small amount of
[436.44 --> 445.26]  work it is so small it takes so little there's even little things like oh the the ability to download dlc
[445.26 --> 447.96]  is being turned off yeah why
[447.96 --> 455.32]  why that's not a multiplayer feature i can almost understand the multiplayer stuff no i can definitely
[455.32 --> 459.36]  understand the multiplayer stuff more right there's more maintenance that goes into it there's more of
[459.36 --> 463.54]  this other kind of stuff this is just a file download okay my devil's advocate hat is off the answer
[463.54 --> 471.38]  is legislation that makes it so that the user owns the software because the fundamental problem right now
[471.38 --> 481.10]  is that when you buy a game you are not buying a copy of the game you are buying a license to use the game
[481.10 --> 489.92]  whatever state it happens to be in and that's the way that the that the software industry as a whole
[489.92 --> 498.08]  has managed to slowly but surely push things because it gives them a much greater degree of control if i was
[498.08 --> 507.10]  someone who was super into anno 2070 for example and i wanted to play multiplayer anno darn it my only
[507.10 --> 513.88]  option now is to either play an older game from back when there were alternate multiplayer options
[513.88 --> 520.32]  and it is possible i actually don't know i haven't tried multiplayer anno 2070 it's possible there is a
[520.32 --> 525.46]  LAN multiplayer although i wouldn't be surprised if there isn't i will say i you and i have to match or
[525.46 --> 530.20]  something you and i have both played anno a fair amount at this point i played a lot less than you
[530.20 --> 535.08]  but still you have exposed to me that the anno developers seem to be quite beloved by the
[535.08 --> 540.88]  community yeah they care people like them very not interesting if you know that but i think a lot of
[540.88 --> 547.08]  people that don't play anno don't know that um is ubisoft mains the studio behind anno are working on
[547.08 --> 553.06]  upgrading the aged online services infrastructure to a new system they're not guaranteeing that it's going
[553.06 --> 558.62]  to be successful but it is not surprising to me and makes me quite happy that like the anno team is
[558.62 --> 565.96]  like oh geez we should try to save this so the problem is that publishers are basically in control
[565.96 --> 570.94]  they're they are creating these situations where your only option is to either play an older one that
[570.94 --> 575.86]  supported LAN multiplayer which you could then play over the internet using a service like hamachi or
[575.86 --> 580.88]  something better or whatever else now or something i don't know some something like that some kind of
[580.88 --> 588.82]  some kind of VPN yeah um or you're pushed to buy the new one the the newer one that gets them more
[588.82 --> 596.46]  money because as we know gaming has gone from a product that you buy and then you own service to a
[596.46 --> 603.08]  service that you are expected to continue to pay for and if you think that this is the only
[603.08 --> 608.42]  manifestation of that i mean we need to look no further than uh that tweet i sent out earlier this
[608.42 --> 612.76]  week about diablo immortal i don't think we're ready for this we'll talk about that soon but first
[612.76 --> 619.30]  the solution to this is pretty straightforward but it would require a grassroots movement that i just
[619.30 --> 625.16]  i don't see any foreseeable path to because a lot of these games that are going to die because of this
[625.16 --> 630.48]  don't have huge player bases exactly it's not it's not throwing anyone up in arms exactly this will
[630.48 --> 637.58]  be one of those things where slowly silently gaming will have changed completely we're going to wake up
[637.58 --> 642.96]  one day and we're going to go holy crap i want to play that game from 10 years ago that i loved
[642.96 --> 648.84]  and there is literally no way to play it and enjoy it with my friends or my children because it has been
[648.84 --> 655.18]  wiped from the face of the earth what we need is legislation that forces these companies to if they
[655.18 --> 661.08]  are not going to maintain it we can't force them to maintain it i mean that's that's fair enough right
[661.08 --> 667.66]  fine you you released this product and we bought it and ultimately you know what you can't maintain
[667.66 --> 672.80]  the service for it anymore okay but if there's a community that is willing to put the effort in or
[672.80 --> 680.68]  the resources into it they need to open source it then it's that simple you must either maintain the
[680.68 --> 688.82]  tools or release the tools yeah yeah like subcom right yep super super cool i also think i would
[688.82 --> 692.26]  like to to make a note here there's a lot of things we have to talk about but i'll talk about this very
[692.26 --> 698.14]  shortly uh my my family like my brother my dad and i and joe actually have been playing this game
[698.14 --> 704.44]  called snow runner uh my dad's super into it that's really cool the multiplayer is rough there are often
[704.44 --> 710.36]  disconnects and if you disconnect you you lose all your progress from that section that one player
[710.36 --> 714.34]  just loses every because you go all the way back to the garage and it's a trucking game um and it's
[714.34 --> 718.68]  like man if i could just host this server on my local computer yeah this probably wouldn't be a
[718.68 --> 723.88]  problem but we have to go through server in ovh or something sure yeah if i have some way to control
[723.88 --> 728.22]  this this won't actually be a problem and that makes us so there's less maintenance and stuff for
[728.22 --> 732.38]  the companies to actually do in a lot of situations i think dedicated servers are the are the
[732.38 --> 737.36]  are the option and the answer in in these cases but moving on you just talked about not being able to
[737.36 --> 742.22]  play a game that's 10 years old yeah now we have to talk about space junkies right space junkies is
[742.22 --> 748.82]  three years old is being decommed right now it is not highly rated i don't think a lot of people play
[748.82 --> 756.98]  it but it's a multiplayer only online vr game from 2019 that is getting decommed there's some other
[756.98 --> 761.46]  interesting things as well about this if you look at the decomm list and you find space junkies
[761.46 --> 769.34]  this is that game that i tried that made me absolutely nauseated in like 30 seconds yeah i've
[769.34 --> 774.70]  been trying to figure out what freaking game it was because i've talked about it before whenever i
[774.70 --> 780.32]  talk about nausea in vr i'm like yeah i'm usually pretty good but there was this one awful game i
[780.32 --> 787.64]  played it drops you at least this was the okay if this is the one it dropped me right into the game
[787.64 --> 793.90]  with an open mic and everyone else had an open mic so it was literally like going back to original
[793.90 --> 800.14]  xbox days of just children shrieking into your ears for no reason like there was no obvious way to turn
[800.14 --> 805.18]  it off at least quickly i think i did figure it out eventually um yeah if this is the game i think it is
[805.18 --> 812.84]  then it's a f***ing awful game yeah um and on on here if you if you look at the list it you notice how
[812.84 --> 817.94]  all these things have like screen like okay yeah sure splinter cell blacklist it shows pc and then
[817.94 --> 821.86]  consoles right there's two different things happening there's a pc happening there's a console
[821.86 --> 828.36]  happening space junkies it only shows pc htc vive and oculus i think they maybe forgot that space
[828.36 --> 837.32]  junkies came out for ps4 um so i have no idea what's happening to space junkies for playstation vr
[837.32 --> 844.22]  because like they don't list it so maybe you'll still be able to play it on uh ps on ps4 what i do
[844.22 --> 854.86]  know pretty much for sure is they're decomming it for pc right except you can still buy it for 27
[854.86 --> 861.54]  dollars on the ubisoft store they're decommissioning it in like what is it like two months or something
[861.54 --> 864.96]  wow it's still purchasable 27 bucks
[864.96 --> 874.90]  why oh so much of this is just so annoying and to be clear if you enjoy space junkies maybe you have a
[874.90 --> 880.58]  different opinion than i do that's fine that's super cool that's super normal sucks for you and
[880.58 --> 886.96]  this sucks because if they were forced to make the tools available at least if you and some friends
[886.96 --> 892.88]  wanted to get together and play some space junkies old school style you'd still be able to now this
[892.88 --> 901.58]  experience however good or bad it was is gone and you might not care right now but there's releases in
[901.58 --> 908.42]  here uh like like far cry 3 far cry 3 is a really legendary game yep you might think right now of the
[908.42 --> 914.34]  far cry series being extremely cookie cutter it became cookie cutter off of the success of far cry 3
[914.34 --> 918.74]  far cry 3 was so successful that they're like we're just going to make this game for 10 years
[918.74 --> 926.30]  um and and they're making it so that you can't download or install dlc like no i'm not sitting here
[926.30 --> 931.58]  thinking that a ton of people are playing far cry 3 multiplayer but i do think that someone might feel
[931.58 --> 937.08]  nostalgic about far cry 3 down the line i want to go back and play it with all the dlc and now they can't
[937.08 --> 940.68]  the bottom line is that the games industry has just
[940.68 --> 951.02]  consolidated to the point where i feel like it's so difficult for a small independent studio to compete
[951.02 --> 959.80]  and the large players are so focused on how to extract the greatest amount of money possible
[959.80 --> 966.98]  from their audience that there's no room for anything else these smaller niche experiences no
[966.98 --> 974.42]  matter how little they cost to continue to maintain are just not even worth the time of bringing up to
[974.42 --> 981.00]  an executive because they just don't present the tiny budget that is required for it so it just gets cut
[981.00 --> 989.06]  and i you know this finally does come back to the the tweet that i posted earlier this week
[989.06 --> 994.34]  where i said something along the lines of i mean it's probably easier to just pull it up at this point
[994.34 --> 1000.06]  something along the lines i've got it actually oh you got it okay no i don't whoops there you go
[1000.06 --> 1009.64]  gaming may be poo now but as gamers at least we can take comfort knowing it's all our fault and the
[1009.64 --> 1017.78]  thing that prompted this thought for me was that diablo immortal is bringing in allegedly this is from
[1017.78 --> 1027.08]  ars technica so it's not exactly some random crap website allegedly over a million dollars a day
[1027.08 --> 1035.52]  in microtransactions and it's like as long as we like as long as we lie down and take it it's a third
[1035.52 --> 1045.12]  of a billion dollars a year it's it's never going to stop and i've seen i've seen man the kinds of the
[1045.12 --> 1049.62]  kinds of conversations that took place in the replies to this tweet i'd wish i i wish i could
[1049.62 --> 1056.10]  unread because they're just come on guys like the amount of gatekeeping oh well mobile games are ruining
[1056.10 --> 1061.70]  everything or this is mobile gamers are not true gamers and just just all that kind of nonsense it's
[1061.70 --> 1069.54]  like no no no gamers gamers as a whole are allowing this change to happen we've been slowly boiled
[1069.54 --> 1080.60]  we're frogs guys it started with horse armor and now you literally will hear true gamers real gamers
[1080.60 --> 1085.60]  you know whatever whatever gatekeeping term you want to use for it you'll hear them say well as long
[1085.60 --> 1093.80]  as it's just cosmetic it's totally fine i'm super into it don't you remember how outrageous it was
[1093.80 --> 1100.24]  for a developer to ship a game that wasn't done yet and make you pay piecemeal for the rest of the
[1100.24 --> 1107.40]  pieces of it later don't you remember and i i don't i'm some partially against that argument
[1107.40 --> 1114.48]  okay compared to a lot of what we've got now where you've got pay to win mechanics that people are just
[1114.48 --> 1122.06]  like okay with the the weird fanboys defending lost ark's pay to win was was a interesting thing to
[1122.06 --> 1127.30]  witness but you got to remember there's this is an entire generation of people who grew up with this
[1127.30 --> 1137.12]  what the f*** are pokemon cards if not pay to win and it's and and gambling yeah from the very start i
[1137.12 --> 1145.62]  mean my childhood my childhood had pay to win gambling as an integral part of it yeah so no wonder we accept
[1145.62 --> 1153.56]  this now yeah yeah i i think you talked about cosmetics and and i don't like being able to buy
[1153.56 --> 1158.14]  cosmetics i've talked about that a lot on way i show because i would rather cosmetics be a reward for
[1158.14 --> 1163.38]  in-game accomplishment um but in some games like i would argue league of legends like if you want to
[1163.38 --> 1170.20]  make league of legends free how else are you going to monetize it i don't mind cosmetics and honestly
[1170.20 --> 1174.88]  actually i kind of do because they're getting to the point where i can't recognize champions anymore
[1174.88 --> 1179.20]  i don't play league of legends enough every once in a blue moon i'll jump in with some friends
[1179.20 --> 1183.54]  and something will attack me and i'll be like who the heck is this and i'll i'll assume it's a champion
[1183.54 --> 1187.96]  that came out after i quit playing and then i'll be like oh no that's a champion i've known for 10
[1187.96 --> 1194.32]  years but couldn't recognize it because now they're a fire god demon and i'm just like what is this yeah
[1194.32 --> 1201.16]  that was a big problem for me with tf2 i was super into tf2 and then along came hats and not just hats
[1201.16 --> 1206.88]  but all of a sudden there were these infinite different variations of weapon loadouts when
[1206.88 --> 1213.40]  the beauty of tf2 was that it was perfectly balanced voice orders yeah perf absolutely
[1213.40 --> 1223.40]  perfectly balanced and every every class was so just perfectly instantly recognizable maybe that's
[1223.40 --> 1228.46]  something we should do at the land we should play tf2 classic vanilla tf2 yeah vanilla tf2 no
[1228.46 --> 1234.18]  no hats i'd be super into that no modded weapons mostly just because i want to play tf2 i i have
[1234.18 --> 1238.78]  heard from people that are like still into tf2 these days that they like those weapons because
[1238.78 --> 1244.42]  there's you can effectively make new classes by doing specific right that unbalances the game
[1244.42 --> 1251.66]  that's the whole problem with it the game so fine fine have your modded server with your crap other
[1251.66 --> 1257.28]  classes and don't make me play it yeah it'd be i'd be cool if there was like vanilla servers i wonder
[1257.28 --> 1262.70]  if there are i don't know there might be people are saying it's still balanced
[1262.70 --> 1272.56]  i mean it might be i have no idea sure this is great under over in the float plane chat says i
[1272.56 --> 1275.96]  actually had my nephew complain today that a mobile game didn't have a cash skin shop
[1275.96 --> 1282.18]  yeah i mean that's that's what we're used to now but and that's where it's going blaming mobile
[1282.18 --> 1289.48]  gaming alone blaming mobile gaming alone is missing the point i mean compared to a franchise like fifa
[1289.48 --> 1295.98]  yeah that too yeah i mean there's huge money that goes into fifa whatever it's called ultimate team
[1295.98 --> 1302.30]  or whatever i don't i don't but remember halo like people were angry about the cash shop in halo
[1302.30 --> 1309.78]  and and i read it all wrong because people were originally stuff that i read about their anger
[1309.78 --> 1314.24]  about the cash shop was how expensive things were and that already for me is just like dude just don't
[1314.24 --> 1318.84]  buy it like why i don't know why is this even a conversation this is literally not an essential
[1318.84 --> 1322.78]  item yeah you the option of just not buying it i mean
[1322.78 --> 1332.58]  just don't buy i the the best way to like get angry and protest this is to not buy it but clearly
[1332.58 --> 1339.08]  gamers as a as a whole have proven themselves at this point to be incapable of doing that yeah and
[1339.08 --> 1344.28]  the thing that i didn't understand about it was it wasn't just that it was expensive people wanted more
[1344.28 --> 1352.48]  they were unhappy that there wasn't enough stuff and i was like what you want you want more things
[1352.48 --> 1358.56]  in the cash shop and and people were like livid about there not being enough stuff in the cash shop
[1358.56 --> 1365.22]  i was it was so confusing and then this this subreddit that i thought was complaining about the fact
[1365.22 --> 1371.66]  that there like was a cash shop or or that how how expensive and stuff that it was would start pinning
[1371.66 --> 1377.12]  the weekly things that were in the cash shop at the top of the subreddit this isn't microsoft doing this
[1377.12 --> 1384.22]  this is the community encouraging people to buy from the cash shop which is like whoa like i i don't
[1384.22 --> 1391.14]  remember my friends encouraging each other to buy legal legend skins you know what i mean yeah like that
[1391.14 --> 1399.16]  it's just it's so weird to me and like i i i ended up following more into the the like the depths of
[1399.16 --> 1404.14]  trying to figure out why people were trying to defend lost ark being a pay-to-win game even though
[1404.14 --> 1408.48]  it like clearly is and i started looking into it and people were getting frustrated that there was
[1408.48 --> 1417.98]  caps on how much they could spend right but the caps were like huge amounts of money and they were
[1417.98 --> 1422.46]  like that's frustrating i want to spend more i have a daily cap on how much i can spend this is bs
[1422.46 --> 1430.34]  what is happening what is going on yeah i don't know i have i have chats with my son
[1430.34 --> 1438.68]  and actually my daughters too now that they're getting into uh gaming more that goes you know uh
[1438.68 --> 1447.12]  what is this does this exist in the real world no do we spend money on this no okay cool yeah
[1447.12 --> 1455.26]  i i have stuff i have bought cosmetics like i i bought rocket league for like four dollars i think
[1455.26 --> 1462.16]  it's fair million years ago up to up to uh up to a reasonable sticker price for a game yeah
[1462.16 --> 1468.56]  somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 100 dollars i think is fair um and i have no problem
[1468.56 --> 1477.18]  to a point with dlc as long as it's i mean and again maybe it's just a generational thing as long
[1477.18 --> 1483.10]  as the dlc is styled after something along the lines of an expansion pack it's adding substantial
[1483.10 --> 1490.54]  content then absolutely exactly like i have i have oh man i've spent like probably 150 dollars on um
[1490.54 --> 1500.02]  on anno dlc but every time it's like adding an entire new like biome that you can explore and
[1500.02 --> 1505.26]  like new characters and new missions and stuff that clearly wasn't actually part of the original game
[1505.26 --> 1513.00]  like we've talked about this before too like i don't feel like i need a new ano no more stuff to do
[1513.00 --> 1518.42]  more things to explore more new mechanics stuff like that sounds great i don't need like new graphics or
[1518.42 --> 1524.22]  it to be set in a different environment i mean it is there was the arctic one yeah so like yeah i
[1524.22 --> 1528.58]  mean i don't need a new ano that's fine just give me more dlc stuff every once in a while yeah beat
[1528.58 --> 1534.72]  saber dlc is another example of what i would consider to be good dlc more content you licensed songs you
[1534.72 --> 1542.28]  actually like did work making new maps and and stuff and i have no problem with that whatsoever
[1542.28 --> 1547.86]  you want to talk about cash shops and adding skins what about twitch bits yeah we've i think we've
[1547.86 --> 1553.12]  unanimously always said twitch bits are crazy yeah don't don't put don't use don't give us twitch
[1553.12 --> 1559.16]  don't give us twitch bits why why are you why are you giving twitch like what is it like this wasn't
[1559.16 --> 1568.32]  the the gotcha that i think you thought it was um we we literally we literally tell our viewers hey
[1568.32 --> 1575.62]  don't send super chats on youtube do not cheer anything we made it so that you get that part for free
[1575.62 --> 1581.04]  and you also get merch so we wanted to give you something we made merch messages so that you can
[1581.04 --> 1587.52]  just you can you can interact with the show and you also get your order in the mail yeah it's not
[1587.52 --> 1593.24]  just nothing you actually get something yeah yeah and like so like i was talking about rocket league i
[1593.24 --> 1598.20]  bought it for like four dollars and then i ended up playing it like crazy so i bought some skins i bought
[1598.20 --> 1603.32]  a season pass at one point i i put money in that i thought was highly appropriate for the amount of time
[1603.32 --> 1609.70]  that i played the game and then they were bought out by epic and then i stopped yeah like whatever
[1609.70 --> 1614.56]  that was the thing when it was like insomniac games or whatever it was before i was like yeah this is a
[1614.56 --> 1619.70]  small studio i want to support i really like this game i really like that there's like this competitive
[1619.70 --> 1625.84]  but like extremely family friendly it's literally just cars driving around game that is able to make
[1625.84 --> 1633.86]  it like that's cool i want to support this so yeah why not speaking of the merch store if you are
[1633.86 --> 1638.98]  looking for something to order today if you want to send a merch message to appear in the little marquee
[1638.98 --> 1645.08]  down there or maybe get curated so that we can address it uh maybe maybe bell will choose you today
[1645.08 --> 1652.20]  we've actually got a new shirt we just launched and it is freaking awesome i wish we'd had the camera
[1652.20 --> 1660.26]  rolling in the pre-show when luke was like unpacking it from uh these really awesome bags by the way did
[1660.26 --> 1664.74]  you notice this i didn't actually notice that i thought that was just like generic i am not a
[1664.74 --> 1671.06]  plastic bag 100 biodegradable that's cool yeah that's legit really cool we're working towards it
[1671.06 --> 1675.90]  feels exactly like a plastic bag much that's why it needs the label yeah we're working towards better
[1675.90 --> 1681.22]  more environmentally friendly packaging but i even thought the tag was pretty cool there's no way you're
[1681.22 --> 1686.92]  gonna be able to see this unfortunately yeah it says rgb edition rgb collection all right yes sorry
[1686.92 --> 1691.80]  maybe there's more coming in the future don't know it's called the multi-nep t-shirt i know that's
[1691.80 --> 1698.50]  a really sort of boring um technical name for it but what it basically means is there's these little
[1698.50 --> 1704.34]  flecks of different colors that are woven into the base color which is kind of like an off white
[1704.34 --> 1711.42]  it's got an ltt logo embroidered in the front and it is both extremely comfortable and in my opinion
[1711.42 --> 1716.60]  super cool looking i've actually gotten more comments on this particular piece of merch than
[1716.60 --> 1720.30]  most other ones you should get down to this photo so people can really see it
[1720.30 --> 1724.44]  did i i think i already saw that one oh did you already see it yeah that one was okay my bad yeah
[1724.44 --> 1732.82]  we've got a cool little rainbow liner inside the neck to go along with the like rgb rgb collection
[1732.82 --> 1741.12]  theme of it and again all this is also in my humble opinion it is very very reasonably priced 24.99 it is
[1741.12 --> 1746.10]  a fair bit more expensive than our regular t-shirts it's a bit more of a complicated product and it took a
[1746.10 --> 1754.40]  long time to get exactly right but it looks really really fun and cool in my opinion i'm so tired
[1754.40 --> 1760.46]  of wearing black t-shirts so this this little splash of color in my wardrobe is extremely no
[1760.46 --> 1764.64]  that's awesome welcome yeah definitely why don't we jump right into another topic you want to pick one
[1764.64 --> 1773.72]  sure let's jump over uh should we should we talk about the million dollars a day thing more or just
[1773.72 --> 1781.96]  no just it's equivalent of like two million subscribers to an to an mmo yeah wow 15 bucks a month
[1781.96 --> 1789.02]  that's a lot like wow so because the reason why i wanted to bring that up is like you're comparing
[1789.02 --> 1796.46]  business models right yeah crazy and like people are proud of it like there's twitch streamers that
[1796.46 --> 1801.74]  were showing on stream this is how much money i've spent so far and it was like a counter so as they
[1801.74 --> 1805.66]  were playing and they're spending more money it was constantly going up and like people were watching
[1805.66 --> 1810.18]  like that was a hype point people were watching because they wanted to like effectively see the number
[1810.18 --> 1820.64]  go up which is definitely helping people not do that um okay moving on your content it's actually
[1820.64 --> 1828.94]  for kids says youtube um youtube's ai is doing some really fun cool things there's a channel called local
[1828.94 --> 1838.02]  58 tv that found that his explicitly 18 plus horror content was suddenly changed to made for kids and he was
[1838.02 --> 1843.74]  unable to change it back without going through an appeal process the video was labeled as inappropriate
[1843.74 --> 1849.92]  for kids manually by him before it was changed by youtube it took nearly 40 hours from when the
[1849.92 --> 1855.64]  creator went public on twitter so so much for the uh standard appeal process with his complaint for the
[1855.64 --> 1863.08]  change to be reverted why youtube would automatically lower the age range for content is anyone's guess
[1863.08 --> 1868.00]  especially when youtube kids is supposed to be this like kind of like safe content safe space for
[1868.00 --> 1875.20]  kids i thought it was supposed to be manually curated like youtube kids the whole idea because back in
[1875.20 --> 1880.12]  the day there was already that problem with those weird like really weird like spider-man elsa things
[1880.12 --> 1889.34]  yeah yeah so they were supposed to fix it after that uh clearly not a thing what garbage i don't know
[1889.34 --> 1895.46]  what else to say about it other than that i mean it's this isn't just harmful to the to the platform
[1895.46 --> 1901.12]  and the user this is extremely harmful to the creator on the one hand you can get a ton of views in youtube
[1901.12 --> 1905.72]  kids because you've just got these like zombie children some of which don't even know how to use
[1905.72 --> 1911.62]  the phone just staring at whatever the next auto play just comes up yeah well their parents cook dinner
[1911.62 --> 1917.18]  or sleep in on a weekend or whatever the case may be and so you can rack up a ton of views but
[1917.18 --> 1924.18]  um if your video is getting served to the wrong audience it can actually be extremely damaging
[1924.18 --> 1931.50]  because if it will increase abandonment from the video which can de-rank you so other creators like
[1931.50 --> 1939.06]  your movie sucks have also been affected and without any kind of manual fix for something like that which
[1939.06 --> 1946.16]  i sincerely doubt they would have this could result in long-term damage to their channel which raises
[1946.16 --> 1952.62]  lots of interesting questions like i don't think anyone's ever actually been able to prove that
[1952.62 --> 1962.70]  google de-listed them or de-ranked them but if they could does that open does that open them up to a
[1962.70 --> 1968.54]  potential lawsuit could you sue for damages yeah i think i think i would be very interested
[1968.54 --> 1975.34]  yeah i don't know because what what recourse is there for a parent who's been assured that youtube
[1975.34 --> 1980.04]  kids is all family-friendly content and then there's 18 plus horror content which like
[1980.04 --> 1985.26]  could actually like really mess with a small child depending on what it is
[1985.26 --> 1992.88]  um i don't know that's spooky i i i'm assuming they're trying to stop ad abuse
[1992.88 --> 2000.52]  uh because i think you get more lucrative ads if you make content that isn't for kids or if you flag
[2000.52 --> 2006.56]  it is not for kids but then it starts like trending with kids uh-huh i think you get better ads on it
[2006.56 --> 2012.34]  so i think they're trying to stop that but in trying to stop that they served horror content to children
[2012.34 --> 2019.98]  yeah and but like i and i mean okay here's a question what difference does it make if you do
[2019.98 --> 2025.60]  allow your content to be viewed by adults if you want to pull it out of youtube kids it just means you
[2025.60 --> 2035.70]  will get less views to kids okay i don't really see why they wouldn't just allow you to do that then
[2035.70 --> 2046.64]  yeah very frustrating in other news nvidia how bad do you feel for them right now not at all i think
[2046.64 --> 2056.76]  nvidia had ordered five nanometer wafers from tsmc before crypto winter hit what that means is that
[2056.76 --> 2065.78]  while nvidia and amd let's be clear neither of them is some kind of white knight no savior for gamers
[2065.78 --> 2073.28]  here no they're giant corpus at all they will sell gpus to whoever is most profitable to sell gpus to
[2073.28 --> 2080.86]  it's that simple and we saw it proven over the last couple of years both of them so it's pretty
[2080.86 --> 2087.08]  amusing for us now to see that they forecasted their their five nanometer wafer production
[2087.08 --> 2094.40]  or their wafer allocation with tsmc based on the kinds of volumes that they were moving selling to
[2094.40 --> 2102.02]  miners and nvidia has already been fined for not properly disclosing what percentage of their sales
[2102.02 --> 2108.16]  were the result of the gpu mining craze and nvidia it's really funny they've gone they flip-flopped
[2108.16 --> 2112.38]  on the issue they've gone from we know exactly where every one of our chips goes to well we have
[2112.38 --> 2118.80]  no we have no way of knowing how many of them are being mined on versus game oh you so do you so do
[2118.80 --> 2126.52]  miners do not install g-force now for instance so you would know if your sales triple and your g-force
[2126.52 --> 2134.68]  now instances go up by 10 that probably some of it went to mining i would think right right nvidia
[2134.68 --> 2140.32]  you can do data analysis right and as much as i tried to get people to not install g-force now
[2140.32 --> 2146.30]  because of all the telemetry crap i'm sure the vast majority of people do so it's convenient it is
[2146.30 --> 2156.74]  anyway the point is nvidia um booked five nanometer wafers with tsmc before they realized that their
[2156.74 --> 2169.56]  sales were going to go which means that the upcoming rtx 4000 series gpus could have um a very good supply
[2169.56 --> 2175.50]  extremely good supply potentially to the point where nvidia was trying to back out of
[2175.50 --> 2180.12]  a pretty significant amount of the wafers as far as i can tell or else i don't think this would be
[2180.12 --> 2188.48]  in the news um they they tsmc just straight up was like nope they are apparently unwilling to make any
[2188.48 --> 2194.40]  major concessions they have agreed oh i i think this this has got to be allegedly i'm not actually
[2194.40 --> 2198.18]  sure if this is confirmed so i'm just going to say allegedly because i'm not double checking it
[2198.18 --> 2203.78]  but they've apparently agreed to delay first shipments by one quarter or even to q1 2023
[2203.78 --> 2210.04]  but if nvidia wants to bail on any of these orders they will apparently be responsible for finding
[2210.04 --> 2217.30]  replacement customers our discussion question this is funny our discussion question is who could nvidia
[2217.30 --> 2227.00]  find to take their orders well let's see there's intel's gpu which as far as we can tell so far is an
[2227.00 --> 2233.76]  absolute dumpster fire intel isn't going to need any more of those um wait is that even no is that even
[2233.76 --> 2239.90]  tsmc 5 nanometer i don't even think so tsmc 5 nanometer i mean there's the upcoming iphone but
[2239.90 --> 2247.08]  isn't apple actually forecasting a reduction in demand as well so apple probably has as much if not
[2247.08 --> 2253.84]  more allocation than they need i know samsung is sitting on apparently piles of smartphones like
[2253.84 --> 2260.78]  way more than they usually would be because of the uh weakening of demand heading into what appears to
[2260.78 --> 2272.20]  be a potential global economic recession um yeah i don't know why i don't know i don't think anyone's
[2272.20 --> 2281.08]  really going to be clamoring at the bit to bail them out yeah okay uh humboldtf over on twitch says
[2281.08 --> 2289.06]  automakers that's a good question but actually no that's exactly it automakers don't need that kind
[2289.06 --> 2295.32]  of performance so they don't operate on the cutting edge node they don't even operate a node or a
[2295.32 --> 2301.20]  couple of nodes back unless their name is maybe tesla is on i was gonna say modern there might be some
[2301.20 --> 2308.84]  like really expensive automated driving cars yeah but that was a whole that was a whole drama around
[2308.84 --> 2315.02]  the whole automotive chip shortage where chip foundries were telling the automakers hey you guys
[2315.02 --> 2320.88]  got to update your crap because we can't we can't keep these ancient manufacturing processes running
[2320.88 --> 2327.60]  like this is actually not feasible we can't ramp up more of this garbage you guys need to redo your
[2327.60 --> 2334.42]  designs on modern nodes so that we can take advantage of the economies of scale at these modern nodes that
[2334.42 --> 2340.30]  everything else is freaking running on and i mean of course the smaller transistors and smaller chip sizes
[2340.30 --> 2345.80]  and better power efficiency like guys get with the program so no they would be they would be the last
[2345.80 --> 2352.94]  ones to step in and and take over five nanometer production um dandrack says drone manufacturers no not
[2352.94 --> 2363.86]  even not even five nanometer they don't they don't need it um yeah yeah new nintendo switch asks whiffs but i mean
[2363.86 --> 2369.74]  that would probably be awesome a nintendo switch with five nanometer performance and power efficiency i'm
[2369.74 --> 2377.30]  super down nintendo enjoys releasing on last generations uh last generations a low performance
[2377.30 --> 2384.14]  yeah fair enough hardware yeah i don't think so flying crocodile says amd yeah but you gotta understand amd
[2384.14 --> 2391.10]  probably has the same overbooking issue the exact same problem whatever is being reported about nvidia
[2391.10 --> 2401.70]  almost certainly applies to amd as well like there's there's yeah cheap chips for gamers
[2401.70 --> 2407.74]  we're saying data centers but data centers would buy completely products yeah yeah yeah they're gonna buy
[2407.74 --> 2412.74]  the gpus they're gonna buy whatever they're not gonna buy the the wafers because these are these are
[2412.74 --> 2417.82]  they're trying to sell wafers they're not selling like they're selling fab capacity yeah right yeah
[2417.82 --> 2431.24]  that's really expensive yeah yeah it's rough oh that is rough um something that isn't rough if we want
[2431.24 --> 2436.94]  to transition off this topic yeah sure no more facebook account requirement for quest 2 we literally
[2436.94 --> 2444.60]  talked about this on last wanshow yeah and uh apparently they heard this podcast and no one else's
[2444.60 --> 2453.42]  complaint no uh they're right did i say good guy facebook finally uh yeah i mean it's a good thing
[2453.42 --> 2458.88]  it's a good thing i don't think they did it out of the kindness of their hearts i don't think this was a
[2458.88 --> 2465.68]  a good guy move as much as they saw it to be a logical necessity moving forward because there's some
[2465.68 --> 2471.00]  really weird things like if you're a company and you want want to set something up with with uh i was
[2471.00 --> 2477.56]  going to say oculus but if you want to set something up with the meta quest it's such a terrible name
[2477.56 --> 2484.74]  um you have to set up like facebook accounts with real people's names and assign them to those
[2484.74 --> 2491.12]  headsets that's really weird because it has to be like a verifiable name or you have to like trick
[2491.12 --> 2496.00]  them with something that sounds realistic which is what as far as i know most like uh corporate
[2496.00 --> 2501.46]  outfits are actually doing uh but it just it just it gets very odd and yes you can buy whatever the
[2501.46 --> 2506.28]  enterprise one as if most corporations are actually doing that if they're if they're small if you're
[2506.28 --> 2510.80]  like some giant massive corporation sure but if you're some small corporation you're gonna go uh no
[2510.80 --> 2516.74]  i'm gonna buy the cheaper one and fake o a facebook account and make it work that way um well plane chat
[2516.74 --> 2523.82]  is so mad they're like no lapsed memory says that's like saying good job to thanos for adopting a child
[2523.82 --> 2531.58]  whose parents he just murdered and and they point out that even though you no longer need a facebook
[2531.58 --> 2538.38]  account you do still need a meta account which is owned by facebook let's go um that it that that
[2538.38 --> 2545.70]  helps a little bit i mean it's it is better um because you don't have to necessarily like tie it to a
[2545.70 --> 2550.60]  public facebook account that like has your name and everything on it which is whack you can link your
[2550.60 --> 2555.80]  meta account to facebook and instagram if you want um so that's that's real cool hope you're
[2555.80 --> 2561.80]  stoked about that um oculus account users will be able to continue using that account until january
[2561.80 --> 2568.64]  2023 uh then you will need to move to a meta account and a meta horizon profile i heard that's the new
[2568.64 --> 2575.40]  meta to continue using the meta vr device with your meta blah blah blah blah blah blah blah hate it
[2575.40 --> 2580.52]  hate it so much join the metaverse um as of now many users attempting to log in via facebook have
[2580.52 --> 2585.56]  faced issues um some people reactivating counts these requests to have met have been met with
[2585.56 --> 2591.58]  instant suspension it's nice oh remember when we owned our software we talked about that earlier
[2591.58 --> 2600.40]  yeah remember when we owned our hardware pepperidge farms remembers um yeah then there's some notes
[2600.40 --> 2605.76]  about how meta's next vr headset might be called the quest pro uh the name was found in code from
[2605.76 --> 2611.56]  meta's august mobile app uh codename project cambria which is what i've heard of yeah um has been shown
[2611.56 --> 2617.16]  off already and could be quest pro and could have full color path pass through capability depth sensors
[2617.16 --> 2622.94]  yada yada some people are estimating the final retail price to be 800 to a thousand usd which sounds
[2622.94 --> 2629.70]  expensive unless they are fully planning on maintaining previous products along with this one
[2629.70 --> 2634.14]  right if they're discontinuing previous products it's too expensive they're not going to launch it
[2634.14 --> 2639.98]  at that yeah um but if quest 2 and quest pro exist simultaneously yes probably fine then i could see
[2639.98 --> 2646.92]  it i gotta tell you i don't think that i'm going to be able to go to inside out tracking if valve goes
[2646.92 --> 2654.10]  inside out i think i might just have to keep my i might just have to keep my index forever unless it
[2654.10 --> 2659.14]  gets wildly better yeah i well one of the things that it doesn't work very so for one thing
[2659.14 --> 2664.36]  when you are swinging your arms around really fast and a lot sometimes they can be easily carried
[2664.36 --> 2670.92]  outside of what can be tracked conveniently from a head-mounted device and number two is that because
[2670.92 --> 2676.78]  when i stream bead saber i put on full body trackers i i don't i don't see any way that you would manage
[2676.78 --> 2683.80]  that with inside out tracking not with tech we have currently um but it may not be feasible to
[2683.80 --> 2690.92]  even continue to compete with meta uh in the space like i i was looking at the market they even are i
[2690.92 --> 2695.28]  was looking at the market share numbers and it's like not even on the same yeah there's a note in
[2695.28 --> 2701.96]  here that says is meta going to take over the vr space they already have like it's they i hope valve
[2701.96 --> 2707.40]  keeps bothering or someone else keeps bothering i mean there are other niche high-end headsets there
[2707.40 --> 2710.86]  was one that we were talking about on when show i think a couple weeks ago or a few weeks ago that
[2710.86 --> 2714.46]  looks amazing but it's what it was like two grand or three grand or something stupid like that
[2714.46 --> 2720.52]  yeah i when i like pissed off the whole world um so i think it was around eight years ago when i said
[2720.52 --> 2725.40]  that vr wasn't going to take off for five to ten years i don't know if you remember that um and then
[2725.40 --> 2732.76]  it took about five to ten years and then it took off so that was pretty cool um but i i think the the
[2732.76 --> 2740.58]  like first jump was uh the the quest two because that was really big right especially when you mean
[2740.58 --> 2749.74]  the first quest uh the first quest was oh you're saying the the quest two is it is the jump it hit
[2749.74 --> 2755.82]  it hit pretty mainline there oh i see yeah i mean other other companies tried samsung had that weird
[2755.82 --> 2761.42]  like thing you could put your phone in that was dumb that was super dumb i hated that that just made
[2761.42 --> 2768.10]  people think vr was bad um but yeah with with quest two like what what what was the one that went just
[2768.10 --> 2776.68]  like gangbusters was that quest one or quest two quest two launch date yeah october 13th 2020 i think
[2776.68 --> 2786.66]  that's right because uh covid hit and then that christmas quest two just went crazy they were sold out like
[2786.66 --> 2792.38]  everywhere that was the first big first like notable jump i think i called that a little that
[2792.38 --> 2797.78]  happened later than i expected and then i think there's going to be another one um and then i think
[2797.78 --> 2801.82]  there's going to be another one after that when companies other than just oculus start making
[2801.82 --> 2807.72]  headsets um that like can actually compete loud face bob on floatplane makes a good point says first
[2807.72 --> 2812.12]  jump was when they dropped the price of the original oculus to 300 bucks it still wasn't mainstream then
[2812.12 --> 2817.96]  yeah and it still didn't really pop off that was a very good thing that needed to happen um
[2817.96 --> 2823.88]  but for mainstream adoption not for the health of the vr hardware market in general in my opinion
[2823.88 --> 2829.34]  because it's basically just subsidizing the hardware with your data something that no one other than
[2829.34 --> 2836.24]  facebook has the capability or willingness to do yeah for sure but yeah like quest two that christmas was
[2836.24 --> 2844.08]  huge the amount of quest two sales was monstrous um and like uh vr games actually started to sell like
[2844.08 --> 2850.56]  pretty okay it's cooled down a fair amount since then um which is why i don't think it's like actually
[2850.56 --> 2857.12]  really here yet is because it has cooled down um and like indexes are still like two grand and like it's
[2857.12 --> 2864.70]  it's still a it's still a bit of a rough space to get in um but yeah but hey at least the show is

[3002.50 --> 3013.48]  rogers went down i don't think it's an interesting topic well the most interesting thing about the we
[3013.48 --> 3021.28]  have a telecom here whose cellular network absolutely pooed itself at 5 a.m today um and one of the most
[3021.28 --> 3030.62]  interesting things about it was that my aunt had her home alarm system start beeping because it lost
[3030.62 --> 3036.94]  cellular connectivity starting at about 2 in the morning that sounds very annoying they were able
[3036.94 --> 3044.84]  to disable it for five minutes at a time so because she had to come and take care of the kids today
[3044.84 --> 3053.24]  my poor uncle had to sit next to the alarm panel for the rest of the night and disable it every five
[3053.24 --> 3060.60]  minutes so that she could sleep poor thing because otherwise it would just go can't you like shut it
[3060.60 --> 3068.18]  off somehow i mean they're not savvy enough to like find the speaker and desolder it okay you know yeah
[3068.18 --> 3073.46]  yeah yeah pretty rough hey you can't like break or flip it because that would be a security problem
[3073.46 --> 3078.30]  so there's some battery backup somewhere yeah she didn't tell us i mean obviously if we could have
[3078.30 --> 3083.94]  there's probably ways around it get it she didn't tell us because she she rogers anyway sorry yeah she
[3083.94 --> 3088.60]  didn't tell us otherwise we could have told her hey you know just chill stay at home take care of
[3088.60 --> 3093.14]  take care of you know my uncle who didn't sleep you know guys why don't you guys take it easy today
[3093.14 --> 3095.84]  she just showed up at our house and was like yeah this happened last night lol
[3095.84 --> 3102.80]  okay uh so just so you know i'm not a monster i wouldn't have been like yeah come in and take
[3102.80 --> 3108.88]  care of the kids anyway but pretty rough so that was the whole that was the thing apparently the
[3108.88 --> 3113.42]  ottawa police had to tweet out telling people to stop calling 9-1-1 to ask when their cell phone will
[3113.42 --> 3121.34]  be working again oh man every once in a while yeah every once in a while humanity just disappoints me
[3121.34 --> 3131.52]  this is really funny um alex did up this topic and put an i told you so in here i don't really
[3131.52 --> 3138.30]  have a discussion question or a discussion topic more just and i told you so for colton who switched
[3138.30 --> 3142.24]  a large portion of the office to rogers this week despite me telling him they are crap
[3142.24 --> 3150.02]  every telco is crap they're all just crap in different ways i don't i don't know the last
[3150.02 --> 3155.66]  time that there was like a service provider that had a national outage uh i mean that's fair but i've
[3155.66 --> 3164.46]  also had my fair share of issues with telus our current provider and i drop calls all the time i have
[3164.46 --> 3170.34]  better connectivity in my house with rogers i i i honestly i was happiest with bell even though
[3170.34 --> 3174.64]  everyone told me bell was garbage i was like i don't know my data speed i don't know if my data
[3174.64 --> 3178.80]  speed's fast or whatever but like my calls don't drop that was a while ago probably because you stayed
[3178.80 --> 3182.98]  in specific areas yeah it could be that i was just as far as my understanding goes bell's really spotty
[3182.98 --> 3187.72]  yeah but that's the thing is everyone told me that if you're in a good spot then and yet here i was
[3187.72 --> 3193.30]  sitting thinking that calls disconnecting was some kind of like third world thing because i hadn't had a
[3193.30 --> 3202.56]  call drop in literally years uh hate it yeah yeah that's about it though i don't think this is
[3202.56 --> 3209.94]  really a ton to say you know what i don't hate let's talk about wide care oh man what a name i know
[3209.94 --> 3216.00]  right what a name it's an extended warranty service that is only available in japan provided by nintendo
[3216.00 --> 3224.46]  called yeah wide care uh it grants customers up to uh 750 in repairs or six repairs per year
[3224.46 --> 3230.78]  uh the warranty covers both accidental and water damage to your switch controllers and the dock
[3230.78 --> 3239.98]  price is 15 bucks a year or a dollar 50 a month or 2 000 yen and 200 yen um and the yearly subscription
[3239.98 --> 3245.16]  can actually be used outside the warranty period i would actually that's not really even a warranty
[3245.16 --> 3253.94]  in my opinion at that price that's closer to an insurance policy and in a way extended warranties
[3253.94 --> 3260.72]  are kind of an insurance policy but the fact that this can be as far as i can tell done on just an
[3260.72 --> 3267.46]  ongoing basis makes it different from an extended warranty that's what makes it an insurance policy
[3267.46 --> 3272.28]  i'm sure they'll stop providing it at some point well yeah but the switch has already been out four or
[3272.28 --> 3278.52]  five years or or whatever and it says that as far as i can tell anyway that you can sign up for it
[3278.52 --> 3283.90]  like now you have to buy extended warranties typically at the time of purchase or within
[3283.90 --> 3290.58]  some short period and they're for a finite amount of time just being able to have peace of mind that
[3290.58 --> 3297.70]  my whatever thing will continue to serve whatever purpose i would have been ongoing basis i pay 15
[3297.70 --> 3303.44]  bucks a year for that that's not bad i would have been viciously against it if it wasn't really cheap
[3303.44 --> 3309.78]  yeah but that's what i'm saying like the price super cheap it's not extended warranty pricing it's like
[3309.78 --> 3315.80]  insurance pricing probably something won't go wrong but if it does hey great i've got insurance right
[3315.80 --> 3322.48]  like that's that's the whole point of it apparently they will cover up to 750 in repairs or six repairs
[3322.48 --> 3329.88]  a year and in my opinion i think it's a really good deal especially for a mobile device i would hope
[3329.88 --> 3338.80]  that this doesn't address right to repair concerns no and it doesn't make nintendo suddenly a good
[3338.80 --> 3344.30]  consumer pro consumer company yes uh people in chat are pointing this out i was thinking about this
[3344.30 --> 3348.56]  already and it's already in the dock so i think there's quite a unified conclusion on this
[3348.56 --> 3359.24]  if this covers joy-con drift like everyone should get it yeah i mean basically i don't know joy-con drift
[3359.24 --> 3368.10]  shouldn't be a problem no absolutely we installed third-party hall effect joysticks in the steam deck
[3368.10 --> 3378.54]  today oh good i have never used a like game controller that made me feel like i really
[3378.56 --> 3389.48]  had fine control i i never played dreamcast never had a dreamcast um it was awesome because you got to
[3389.48 --> 3397.32]  remember not only does a hall effect sensor have a much uh much better longevity because it's it's
[3397.32 --> 3405.36]  magnetic based rather than potentiometer based um if it if it's centered perfectly it will be centered
[3405.36 --> 3413.10]  perfectly every time and valve also has a tool on the steam deck to allow you to adjust your dead
[3413.10 --> 3419.76]  zones so if you know you have an outstanding reliable joystick that will always center perfectly
[3419.76 --> 3425.16]  and always read perfectly in every direction because it uses freaking magnets how do they work
[3425.16 --> 3432.82]  then you can reduce the size of your dead zone oh cool so my dead zones were so small that even
[3432.82 --> 3437.78]  playing an fps game because that's what happens when i try to play fps games on a controller so i'm
[3437.78 --> 3444.02]  like oh it's not moving it's not moving it's not moving and oh off we go right but i was actually
[3444.02 --> 3450.28]  able to fine tune it and aim that's pretty sweet oh cool oh i love it so one thing that i just thought
[3450.28 --> 3456.40]  of about the current topic started derail slightly but uh is that they they entirely get to decide how
[3456.40 --> 3465.54]  much the repairs cost who does nintendo oh they're the only one offering the service right so up to
[3465.54 --> 3472.00]  750 in repairs but like how much does it cost to replace a joy-con yeah that's fair i don't know
[3472.00 --> 3478.82]  that's a good question um yeah we'll have to see i don't know i'm not like overjoyous about this
[3478.82 --> 3484.24]  because i would rather it was more of a right to repair situation i would rather that there was some
[3484.24 --> 3489.80]  form of solution given for joy-con drift i i don't think uh nintendo is a saint of a company
[3489.80 --> 3496.80]  they have a lot of issues in this regard it's cheap it is only provided in japan yep i wouldn't
[3496.80 --> 3502.32]  be surprised if this didn't go outside of japan yeah there's a lot of only japan stuff that companies
[3502.32 --> 3507.32]  like sony and nintendo do yeah or sharp or someone's saying joy-con repairs are free you can send them
[3507.32 --> 3512.06]  to nintendo and they will repair for free yeah for now but i think what luke's saying is there needs
[3512.06 --> 3519.54]  to be a long-term solution um hold on a second constantly sending your controllers out and
[3519.54 --> 3527.04]  needing to wait like a super long time stop spamming it by the way um but okay i'm just gonna start
[3527.04 --> 3535.16]  banning people loudface bob says mad cats made a good one uh oh a good dreamcast controller i mean i find
[3535.16 --> 3541.68]  that very i don't very difficult i doubt that did mad cats ever make anything good apparently they still
[3541.68 --> 3549.12]  exist really which i was surprised did they get bought out i mean i don't know maybe yeah look at
[3549.12 --> 3556.46]  this mad cats dare to lead aren't these the same products that they had like a decade ago i don't
[3556.46 --> 3562.84]  think so like this is a different rat i mean a lot of the branding is the same i remember them having
[3562.84 --> 3568.48]  like a strike keyboard back in the day the rat looks very similar it might technically be different but
[3568.48 --> 3574.06]  this looks really really similar it's a triumphant return of the beloved rat apparently so yeah i think
[3574.06 --> 3579.32]  it's supposed to look similar luke i don't think anyone i mean their site is not even loading pictures
[3579.32 --> 3587.16]  for me right now this is amazing i don't think anyone loved the rat uh i mean the the other pm that i
[3587.16 --> 3595.70]  worked with at ncix who was in charge of mad cats loved the rat he he was so desperate to sell rats man
[3595.70 --> 3606.06]  oh no uh what else we got today oh oh uh we also have a deal of the week
[3606.06 --> 3615.16]  okay this is odd uh if for whatever reason you were to find yourself needing a lot of hats
[3615.16 --> 3619.58]  uh hats for you and all your friends the deal
[3619.58 --> 3631.16]  the deal of the week is buy four dad hats of any style on ltt store and get them for 50 off
[3631.16 --> 3642.98]  four hats for 40 dollars so yeah need lots of hats in lots of different styles let me tell you
[3642.98 --> 3652.20]  where you can go you're gonna want to go clothing okay wait are hats clothing are they clothing or gear
[3652.20 --> 3664.40]  there we go dad hat and here you will find all the different styles like washed black khaki gray blue red
[3664.40 --> 3670.92]  and other more different black deep black all right cool so there you go guys you need a fresh
[3670.92 --> 3677.18]  supply of dad hats we got you covered we should probably do a couple merch messages actually bell hit me
[3677.18 --> 3687.16]  hello uh first question here speaking of nintendo any updates did we ever hear from nintendo after the
[3687.16 --> 3693.92]  video was posted nope i mean it's still early there's plenty of time realistically i don't think
[3693.92 --> 3701.60]  there's a whole lot that they can say about it everything that we did was here legal um it's just
[3701.60 --> 3709.24]  one of those things where my you know my position is that nintendo has a lot of growing up to do as a
[3709.24 --> 3716.90]  company they they need to just chill out a little bit figure out what their what their value add is to
[3716.90 --> 3721.68]  gamers and stop intentionally antagonizing them i think they could actually be more successful
[3721.68 --> 3729.44]  if they took a more open approach to both their hardware and their software and um i just i i get
[3729.44 --> 3736.08]  very frustrated with their hypocrisy where they'll go after emulation as a whole and the developers of
[3736.08 --> 3745.84]  emulators and then they'll go and use emulators um like okay are you against it or do you view it as a
[3745.84 --> 3751.22]  as a valuable tool you can't really have it both ways it frustrates me when companies have games that
[3751.22 --> 3761.08]  have like very prevalent competitive scenes and then they just like pretend they don't exist um it'd be
[3761.08 --> 3765.40]  nice to see nintendo like engaging with the smash community or whatever also though that community is
[3765.40 --> 3775.52]  like super sketched so a little questionable but yeah from alan as a guy who runs a high school esports
[3775.52 --> 3780.44]  team and helps the tech department do you have any thoughts on high school esports teams oh hold on i
[3780.44 --> 3786.10]  want to clarify something i think it was actually sony that um used an emulator in a product that they
[3786.10 --> 3791.06]  that they ended up releasing that was not developed by them was it that was it them guys help me out in
[3791.06 --> 3796.38]  the chat here it was nintendo as well i thought so too but i'm not immediately finding it so
[3796.38 --> 3804.84]  uh sorry what was that bell uh from alan he runs an esport team at a high school and wonders what
[3804.84 --> 3812.28]  your thoughts are on high school esports teams uh i mean i don't really see it as any different from a
[3812.28 --> 3819.38]  high school chess club or like uh i was in our group that i was in the group that represented our
[3819.38 --> 3826.58]  school at the physics olympics hey me too like i it what's the what's the difference between that and
[3826.58 --> 3832.38]  any other any other organized school activity i don't know that
[3832.38 --> 3841.86]  i don't know that i would want it to become like an all-consuming thing for my kids at that age like
[3841.86 --> 3846.42]  i'd like them to make sure that they're also getting their fair share of physical activity but
[3846.42 --> 3855.40]  i i i think that it's it's like any other school club it's a great way to foster relationships with
[3855.40 --> 3862.00]  like-minded people and build friendships and uh i i think there's a lot of opportunity to learn a lot
[3862.00 --> 3866.60]  of the same things that you would in any other organized sport for example like teamwork and
[3866.60 --> 3872.94]  communication yeah i mean i don't know what else to say about it it's a school club i would focus on
[3872.94 --> 3881.00]  those things that you just said focus on getting them to effectively don't make it make it very very
[3881.00 --> 3888.38]  hard for them to tell that that's your goal um but teach them like life skills leadership um communication
[3888.38 --> 3896.84]  stuff like that from sam we're looking for another linus paint tips anything any suggestions for outdoor
[3896.84 --> 3903.98]  painting or porch painting oh porch painting is tough pretty much anything you walk on will wear
[3903.98 --> 3912.32]  off so if i had to if i had to paint a walk-on surface i would be sure to use a stain um something
[3912.32 --> 3919.40]  that soaks into the material like like an oil or a stain um because when you recoat that kind of stuff
[3919.40 --> 3929.14]  it's uh it's sometimes not always a lot less work because it's like it soaks into the it soaks into
[3929.14 --> 3934.88]  the material which means that it's not going to flake off in quite the same way that uh that a paint
[3934.88 --> 3940.84]  would and once paint starts to fail and it starts to flake you have to go at it hard and get everything
[3940.84 --> 3946.52]  possible off before you recode it otherwise it will continue to flake under the new paint and it will
[3946.52 --> 3951.50]  create like cracks where moisture can get in and it will start to lift up all the paint so you'll
[3951.50 --> 3958.66]  basically just be wasting your time um as for outdoor i mean yeah the main thing is prep prep is
[3958.66 --> 3965.04]  most of the job applying the paint to the wall is like a third of the battle so you got to make sure
[3965.04 --> 3971.06]  you get everything scraped off scrape sand white prime paint anywhere the paint is failing cracking
[3971.06 --> 3976.04]  alligatoring peeling it's a lot of work
[3976.04 --> 3983.64]  from nathaniel hi linus question on your role as ceo and the future of yvonne and partners
[3983.64 --> 3989.00]  do you envision becoming too big for you to candidly engage with your community or everything in the
[3989.00 --> 4000.04]  works oh i i mean there's lots of stuff that's going on that we don't necessarily talk about
[4000.04 --> 4005.68]  yeah i mean i i want to talk about more things we shot a lab update today that i think is going to
[4005.68 --> 4012.56]  be a really cool video we basically went through every member of the lab both new like on probation
[4012.56 --> 4019.50]  and established and looked at what they're working on the the the probation the probationary people had
[4019.50 --> 4027.64]  to wear a fallout guy masks and a guy fox mask so because they're still anonymous but anyway um
[4027.64 --> 4039.20]  is that the yeah okay yeah yeah um it's the development team yeah yeah i i hmm is it just the
[4039.20 --> 4044.72]  development team is anyone else no everyone else is is cleared for camera uh do you envision becoming
[4044.72 --> 4051.96]  too big to candidly engage with your community man i don't want to i don't want to be so big that
[4051.96 --> 4059.24]  the lawyers have to do a sanity check on on what i say and i don't want to get to the point where i'm
[4059.24 --> 4066.16]  so detached that i don't have our own internal checks and balances to make sure that i don't say
[4066.16 --> 4072.16]  anything too stupid i mean as it is we're not at any risk of that because i can i need both my hands
[4072.16 --> 4077.90]  to count the number of people that will just tell me i'm a idiot when i say something stupid and
[4077.90 --> 4085.32]  uh you know that are able to get me to back down on a bad idea i mean we actually we actually had
[4085.32 --> 4091.84]  something like that happen this week i i had i was in a conversation with colton and we were like hey
[4091.84 --> 4097.96]  we should embrace the whole name of the whale land and just make every ticket like a whale ticket
[4097.96 --> 4105.84]  so every ticket includes admission a wan hoodie a desk pad a tour of the office up a food truck
[4105.84 --> 4112.48]  voucher you know thing for three meals a day and all this and we should just have like like put all
[4112.48 --> 4118.06]  these like bundles together and it should be like 500 tickets and we were like yeah let's yeah let's do
[4118.06 --> 4123.76]  it and and on the surface it's actually not a terrible idea from a business standpoint because
[4123.76 --> 4129.58]  the reality of it is we only have a couple hundred seats and there was a lot of value being baked into
[4129.58 --> 4135.96]  those tickets we are going to sell through that couple hundred seats like that if it was a thousand
[4135.96 --> 4143.74]  dollars it would sell through in like 15 minutes so really whatever price we ultimately settle on
[4143.74 --> 4152.46]  is how much revenue do we want to make from the land we have no way of expanding the capacity because
[4152.46 --> 4157.08]  it's going to be in lab two we're actually going to be in the warehouse of lab two running the land it's
[4157.08 --> 4165.30]  going to be freaking awesome um and that was a way for us to maximize that revenue for the company
[4165.30 --> 4172.34]  which we need while also providing a really solid value to anyone who buys the ticket because it was
[4172.34 --> 4180.02]  going to be like a bundle deal however you know luke made a really good point that was like hey like
[4180.02 --> 4185.60]  my dad and my friends won't be able to like afford that and go it's it's especially
[4185.60 --> 4193.16]  okay fair enough we haven't announced a date but the date will not be super far out from when we do
[4193.16 --> 4202.76]  announce it um and if the ticket's like 250 500 um that's a lot of spending money to come up with
[4202.76 --> 4209.26]  on a like a super short notice if it was planned like six months ahead maybe even then it's still a
[4209.26 --> 4213.24]  lot of spending money to throw at one event um and like yeah you are getting other stuff you're getting
[4213.24 --> 4217.52]  the mouse pad potentially you're getting this hoodie like it there's a lot of value in there
[4217.52 --> 4225.04]  and and my pitch to luke how sick would it be if all the pictures and video from the land were people
[4225.04 --> 4230.24]  in this like uniform gaming like everyone's wearing the same hoodie that would have been so cool pretty
[4230.24 --> 4234.86]  cool but there's also issues with that if people are coming to land they're very likely super fans
[4234.86 --> 4240.68]  they might already have one of the hoodies yeah so we don't want them to end up with a second hoodie
[4240.68 --> 4246.38]  so yeah to be pretty rough clear we're not doing that yep so we'll we'll figure out something that
[4246.38 --> 4252.36]  kind of makes sense and i think we'll try to we'll try to have like bundles and add-ons as things that
[4252.36 --> 4258.84]  people absolutely can buy as part of the experience like i i think we'll probably do studio tours we've
[4258.84 --> 4262.78]  done them during ltx before in the past and it's been a pretty fun way to engage with the community
[4262.78 --> 4267.48]  coming back to that question do you envision becoming too big to candidly engage with the community i think
[4267.48 --> 4276.12]  if i do we will completely lose i think i think we'll fail ultimately so i i don't think that
[4276.12 --> 4281.16]  i or i mean i'd love to think that we have a leadership team that could carry on without me
[4281.16 --> 4286.38]  i i'd like to think that we will not stop engaging with the community whether it's reading comments or
[4286.38 --> 4292.42]  talking to people like this or whatever that ends up looking like and i mean luke and i both intend to sit
[4292.42 --> 4298.46]  in with the general population at the land not because we have to because but because that's
[4298.46 --> 4303.70]  something we want to do um i don't i don't see that changing anytime too soon
[4303.70 --> 4310.84]  from joshua hey luke we all know starting flowplane and running it hasn't been easy over the years
[4310.84 --> 4314.96]  but according to you have there been any memorable or best parts of running the flowplane
[4314.96 --> 4322.52]  uh system and team um i will say that that's one of the downsides of having an all remote team
[4322.52 --> 4330.16]  um is like i i think we've done a good job of um especially like talking to other people that have
[4330.16 --> 4334.48]  that have worked on remote teams and and talking to my friends who have managed remote teams and
[4334.48 --> 4339.20]  and stuff i think we've done a pretty good job of like keeping productivity up and and and doing
[4339.20 --> 4343.64]  things like that i think our meeting structure has been good and mentally healthy for people and
[4343.64 --> 4351.50]  yada yada yada um but not having everyone together all the time definitely reduces or ever because
[4351.50 --> 4356.14]  of covid or ever yeah because it was supposed we were supposed to have these like yearly meetups
[4356.14 --> 4362.10]  around ltx and then that's obviously not a thing hey we should fly them in for the land
[4362.10 --> 4368.36]  i'm down some of them are in like overseas
[4368.36 --> 4372.46]  okay i'll ask um
[4372.46 --> 4381.56]  he's like land i want to land okay well i guess i guess there's there's at least one
[4381.56 --> 4389.96]  um okay yeah well i'll try to figure that kind of stuff but yeah it limits the possibility of some
[4389.96 --> 4395.40]  of those types of moments right some of those team building kind of moments um so we we i try to
[4395.40 --> 4401.34]  create that as much as possible but yeah it's it is limiting i remember uh one of my favorite times
[4401.34 --> 4405.52]  i think there was a there was a crunch i don't even necessarily remember what it was for but i
[4405.52 --> 4412.72]  remember verified actual gamer no but that one was actually really good that one was cool it was it
[4412.72 --> 4417.94]  was a float plane feature crunch and i was it was when i had my my office was your current office
[4417.94 --> 4424.62]  and i remember being there until like six in the morning or something and just like anytime you're in
[4424.62 --> 4431.66]  voice chat with people working on something and it gets past like 3 a.m things get a little wild
[4431.66 --> 4440.84]  yeah yeah so that was that was good um and i mean there's been there's been a lot of them there's been
[4440.84 --> 4446.94]  it's it's mostly like the things that we have created have been like really cool and it's the
[4446.94 --> 4451.02]  accomplishments and stuff it's not necessarily the like day-to-day moments because we are
[4451.02 --> 4459.34]  literally disconnected right so yeah yeah let's just let's bring them out for the land cool sounds
[4459.34 --> 4467.30]  good yeah from david sad to see the ldt intros disappearing how's that experiment been going
[4467.30 --> 4474.64]  any insights to share um overall viewership is up on the channel um pretty consistently over the last
[4474.64 --> 4479.88]  six months it's been slow going it's really noticeable how much youtube is emphasizing shorts
[4479.88 --> 4485.08]  and i think a lot of it's coming out of promotion for back catalog that's my gut feeling i i don't have
[4485.08 --> 4490.46]  detailed analytics to to share with you guys where i can where i can prove it like that's the that's
[4490.46 --> 4495.94]  the challenge right is it's and it's always changing it's like it's shifting sands under you so
[4495.94 --> 4501.00]  you just you do your best with it you pick up your divining rod you try and find water algorithm
[4501.00 --> 4506.70]  water right um it's hard to say because we're always changing so many things whether it's topic
[4506.70 --> 4515.46]  selection or um you know writing style or uh like the the text that we have at the beginning of the
[4515.46 --> 4520.02]  videos now that's designed to improve retention when people are scrolling with their audio off try
[4520.02 --> 4524.62]  to kind of hook them into the video it's just you're changing so many things it's hard to tell
[4524.62 --> 4533.30]  what exactly is making the difference but overall viewership is super super healthy across the the
[4533.30 --> 4541.48]  empire um i actually have a dashboard that allows me to see all of them at once now but i'll need a
[4541.48 --> 4549.82]  minute if i'm going to try to sign into it to to show it to you guys um i would say though
[4549.82 --> 4558.50]  gut feeling wise that reducing the amount of filler in the first 30 seconds of the video is
[4558.50 --> 4563.26]  almost certainly a good thing for long-term viewer satisfaction yeah
[4563.26 --> 4573.00]  in the meantime from thomas question for linus and luke what kind of quality control and continuous
[4573.00 --> 4580.56]  improvement processes are there at lmg we do so much stuff that's a difficult question to answer
[4580.56 --> 4584.98]  because we do so many different things and and each department is going to have different ways of
[4584.98 --> 4591.58]  handling that yeah that's a lot i i don't even know i don't even know what i mean we review every video
[4591.58 --> 4597.82]  uh i mean okay you you and your in your development digest you were talking about that super cool new
[4597.82 --> 4603.72]  thing that allows you to roll back stuff oh that's not that's not out yet but yeah um i don't know
[4603.72 --> 4608.56]  that we're we're going to be working with a system that's going to allow us to do a b testing and
[4608.56 --> 4614.66]  rollbacks um but in regards to quality control like we have we have a cicd pipeline um
[4614.66 --> 4619.54]  we could talk about this for a super long time
[4619.54 --> 4632.30]  um all right i feel like it would probably be a bad idea for me to show this particular
[4632.30 --> 4639.08]  um number so i'm just gonna i'm hold on don't worry i'm being very responsible luke
[4639.08 --> 4644.18]  i'm being a very responsible boy who only shares analytics that don't matter
[4644.18 --> 4651.68]  there okay okay coming with no pen i think that seems fine argo that was any of it yeah yeah uh
[4651.68 --> 4656.82]  yeah it's not out yet though hold on let me just let me just fix this up okay all right yeah that this
[4656.82 --> 4663.74]  this should be this should be completely fine so this is a super cool little dashboard that i have
[4663.74 --> 4667.84]  that actually has all of our almost scrolled the page
[4667.84 --> 4676.98]  so close you didn't do it though that's a win it has all of our all of our channel videos on it we
[4676.98 --> 4684.42]  can see things like what's um performing better than it was what's performing worse than it was
[4684.42 --> 4692.36]  what's getting views in the last 48 hours or uh i believe this real-time one can also show
[4692.36 --> 4697.82]  60 minutes no this this one this one doesn't i don't think and then if i dig deeper into
[4697.82 --> 4705.26]  the analytics i can see see more here we go well i just need to make sure i don't show anything
[4705.26 --> 4713.16]  that'll get me in trouble because i think if i just straight up and look yep here's our cpms i am
[4713.16 --> 4719.06]  going to i'm gonna cause some headaches for some people that i like a lot and want to continue working
[4719.06 --> 4731.38]  with i hate how this dashboard works now i actually cannot understand why it doesn't just
[4731.38 --> 4745.06]  show me the overall views not by by content i just want to see views i yeah i can't
[4745.06 --> 4755.34]  use by channel how do i just how do i just combine them which one's hide metric okay all right here
[4755.34 --> 4762.08]  maybe you guys can help me with this there you go so you can see all the channels here if i can i
[4762.08 --> 4768.72]  unselect ltt oh no i can show only ltt okay cool so if we look at only ltt we only got this dashboard
[4768.72 --> 4774.40]  a little while ago so it's only going back to february but you can see overall this trend line is up
[4774.40 --> 4782.04]  obviously we have our spikes and and our dips and then if we take ltt out and take out also the
[4782.04 --> 4788.18]  channels that really don't get a lot of views like uh they're just movies um channel super fun super
[4788.18 --> 4795.40]  spiky so i'm gonna pull that out you can see that the overall trend is towards more more views which
[4795.40 --> 4801.18]  is you know obviously the objective of what we're doing more importantly the business team the merch team
[4801.18 --> 4809.08]  um labs team is all working on ways constantly to help us monetize the content better because
[4809.08 --> 4816.36]  at the end of the day if the only lever that you have to pull is make more content eventually you're
[4816.36 --> 4822.50]  going to collapse under your own weight we can't have 300 channels that we're managing and expect to
[4822.50 --> 4828.22]  do it with the kind of polish and quality that we do care it's like when you go to a restaurant
[4828.22 --> 4835.54]  and the menu is like like 10 pages deep and dense and there's like a just a bajillion things it's
[4835.54 --> 4840.06]  like oh this probably isn't going to be very good because they're probably not cheesecake factory
[4840.06 --> 4847.86]  i love cheesecake i don't know if i've ever oh their menu is ridiculous i've been there once it's a novel
[4847.86 --> 4851.94]  i've been there one time and i know it's trashy i like it anyway
[4851.94 --> 4861.90]  all right i don't want to stir up any controversy oh no this really this stood out this is from
[4861.90 --> 4868.70]  patrick linus why do i see you in regular shoes during the youtube shorts are the socks and sandals
[4868.70 --> 4875.34]  a scam that is concerning yeah this is a problem my sandals broke and i've been too lazy to replace them
[4875.34 --> 4884.48]  wow yeah it's actually surprising it's like next level yeah um fun fact the only reason i ever
[4884.48 --> 4890.44]  replaced any of my sandals ever i have never bought a pair of those sandals those like echo sandals that
[4890.44 --> 4895.32]  i wear my aunt would always buy them for me yeah and then i told her i'm a grown-ass man you can stop
[4895.32 --> 4903.68]  buying me shoes at some point and so she did and now i don't have shoes except the vessies that vessie
[4903.68 --> 4905.48]  sent me for free so i put those on
[4905.48 --> 4913.38]  i uh these shoes yes you know what i got those
[4913.38 --> 4921.62]  was it around the time you started working here sure was there are massive holes in them the right
[4921.62 --> 4926.24]  foot i i put them in the dryer one time and it got caught in part of the dryer because i didn't
[4926.24 --> 4930.34]  have a dryer bag for my shoes because i was too cheap and it got caught in the sidewall of the dryer
[4930.34 --> 4938.10]  so it has a a permanent like uplift on the end of it uh there are there are identical rips on each
[4938.10 --> 4943.60]  shoe uh because i stopped because of covid but when i used to do boxing training every week
[4943.60 --> 4950.30]  the like side to side movement would stress out the same part of the shoe they are ratty but they
[4950.30 --> 4956.14]  don't sell these anymore i actually put a bounty out for a pair that were this size that was like
[4956.14 --> 4962.16]  i think it was like 300 bucks or something yeah i was like i really just want these shoes and you
[4962.16 --> 4968.28]  just can't get them i have never worn a pair of shoes that fit as nicely as these and it's not like
[4968.28 --> 4972.08]  oh it's because they're worn in i remember when i first put them on the store i was like whoa these
[4972.08 --> 4976.38]  are perfect i should have bought like a bunch that's what i did with the badminton shoes that i
[4976.38 --> 4980.78]  have now i should have done a pair of court shoes that was like these fit me like a glove i bought six
[4980.78 --> 4988.54]  pairs yeah and like these are just like racked right i've gone and tried to like tried to spend
[4988.54 --> 4992.98]  good money and buy nice shoes because i think you should have like shoes that fit you well and stuff
[4992.98 --> 4998.64]  um and i i can't find anything that even remotely compares i've tried a bunch of different brands
[4998.64 --> 5004.54]  i've tried to like i don't know i can't figure it out oh man never change luke never change
[5004.54 --> 5012.56]  from andy it's been just over a year since your don't build a hackintosh video do you think
[5012.56 --> 5020.32]  hackintosh is dead oh wow yeah pretty much i mean it's very clear that the software innovation that
[5020.32 --> 5029.96]  apple is putting into mac os is apple silicon centric going forward i think they still sell some intel
[5029.96 --> 5036.98]  based max do they i don't even i don't even know i know nobody's talking about them no one cares about
[5036.98 --> 5044.52]  them can tell yeah the mac pro mac pro is still for sale for the time being so it will be at least
[5044.52 --> 5052.22]  some years after the last intel mac rolls off the line that you will still be able to run mac os on
[5052.22 --> 5059.92]  intel silicon but i i just i just don't see it being viable in the long term
[5059.92 --> 5067.46]  from sense op hi linus and luke hope you're doing well i wonder if either of you like lego or if
[5067.46 --> 5075.64]  you have any favorite sets i feel like i'm feeding into my own stereotype today but lego is really
[5075.64 --> 5085.30]  expensive um it is okay i uh i never got way too into lego when i was a kid um i think partially
[5085.30 --> 5091.20]  because uh my family had some financial struggles and lego is really expensive but i think it's pretty
[5091.20 --> 5099.72]  cool uh my girlfriend for christmas bought me uh these this little like uh there was like a plants
[5099.72 --> 5106.20]  and animals lego release thing and she found one that was two budgies and they like somewhat color
[5106.20 --> 5110.32]  matched the budgies that we have so she bought me those and i built that and put it together and it
[5110.32 --> 5114.64]  was it's pretty cool i enjoyed that i thought that was cool the ones that you have are sweet
[5114.64 --> 5120.00]  i didn't know those existed at all i actually ended up looking them up after i got home and then was
[5120.00 --> 5126.10]  like i'll leave that to him um but they're really cool like they're like piano and stuff and they have
[5126.10 --> 5132.76]  this whole architecture line i think that's awesome um yeah really cool stuff just really pricey and i
[5132.76 --> 5135.62]  don't know what i would really want to do with it when i was done that's another
[5135.62 --> 5143.60]  ivan really likes the uh the flower ones we are actually using lego flowers in place of
[5143.60 --> 5149.78]  real flowers in our house because they just look like if you don't look closely they actually look
[5149.78 --> 5154.74]  pretty convincing and then if you look closely like oh cool that's kind of cool yeah yeah so that seems
[5154.74 --> 5160.04]  like a very us thing to do but it's not the kind of thing that i do enjoy putting the sets together but
[5160.04 --> 5165.92]  i've just never found that i had the vision to come up with my own stuff like my eight-year-old
[5165.92 --> 5170.98]  daughter will put together more creative stuff out of the the spare parts bin that i would be able to
[5170.98 --> 5175.74]  come up with i just that's what i really liked with lego is like back in the day we had just like
[5175.74 --> 5180.78]  i don't think i don't think we ever had sets when we were growing up but we we had just like a bin of
[5180.78 --> 5184.74]  like some whatever i don't know if we got it from what it doesn't matter but we had just like a bin
[5184.74 --> 5191.14]  and i had a fun time just like making whatever i would make things to like push my little model
[5191.14 --> 5197.94]  cars through or whatever i don't know that's fine aj techie 369 asked me if there's an update on the
[5197.94 --> 5204.38]  on youtube following up with me regarding the comment spam so i do need to give you guys that
[5204.38 --> 5210.26]  um maybe we can take a merch messages break and go over that for yeah maybe just let me just make
[5210.26 --> 5216.00]  sure that this is not like controversial or anything like that uh yeah it looks like i have
[5216.00 --> 5225.86]  been invited to speak with youtube they're um they're continuing to investigate and uh they want me
[5225.86 --> 5233.06]  to talk about any of my experiences on any of our channels around impersonation porn bots or scams
[5233.06 --> 5239.38]  crypto bots or scams ad scams users being directed toward telegram signal whatsapp etc conversations
[5239.38 --> 5246.64]  between seemingly fake users and comments other types of spam or scammy behavior and uh i i am going
[5246.64 --> 5252.70]  to try to make time for this i would really like to see an end to this problem on the platform so
[5252.70 --> 5258.70]  anything that i can do to help i think would be a positive thing especially if i'm going to call them
[5258.70 --> 5265.12]  out you know the least i can do is if they do reach out and say you know hey we value your feedback
[5265.12 --> 5270.78]  you know what can we do about it um the least i can do is actually provide that feedback right
[5270.78 --> 5276.56]  um so i also heard from a friend who works at youtube sort of i mean it's like a business
[5276.56 --> 5283.06]  relationship but you know we chat about business too yeah friendly um just kind of clarifying if i
[5283.06 --> 5288.18]  have increased strictness turned on on all my channels clearly clearly our discussion last week has
[5288.18 --> 5295.34]  penetrated the youtube bureaucracy um am i correct in understanding that the majority of these are in
[5295.34 --> 5301.04]  replies rather than root comments and apparently there's uh yeah there's there's there's action
[5301.04 --> 5309.46]  there's action being taken and i'm glad i'm glad to see it and hopefully they will take strict enough
[5309.46 --> 5317.64]  decisive enough action that we can get rid of the problem expunge the scammers and then slowly work
[5317.64 --> 5322.44]  our way back towards you know the the features that are that are nice to have as long as they're not
[5322.44 --> 5329.66]  being abused yeah like i'm gonna hold praise back until they do something um and i still think it's
[5329.66 --> 5335.12]  ridiculous that are like that they're like are you telling me these are mostly in replies instead of
[5335.12 --> 5342.42]  like look yeah at your own platform i mean i i literally screen capped as we live discovered
[5342.42 --> 5350.10]  yeah the problem last week but yes still so i i think the amount of credit that is due for them
[5350.10 --> 5356.44]  reaching out is not super high but if they do something about it it's better than nothing yes if
[5356.44 --> 5360.52]  they do well i don't know i don't actually think it has any value if they don't do anything about it
[5360.52 --> 5366.76]  um that's why i'm kind of like withholding praise personally for now if they take action if they do
[5366.76 --> 5373.04]  things about it then sweet that's good but yeah jim zentu on floatplane says there is apparently a
[5373.04 --> 5379.66]  deal at walmart on the lego flower bouquet the marketing ai is listening that is the creepiest
[5379.66 --> 5386.56]  stuff i can't prove it you know i can't prove it but anecdotally boy does it ever feel like that
[5386.56 --> 5390.90]  happens doesn't it yeah you're talking about something and all of a sudden your ad feed is full
[5390.90 --> 5395.50]  of like you know make an offhand comment about blow-up dolls and all of a sudden all my ads are for that
[5395.50 --> 5401.08]  i mean i've never searched for that before of course of course not yeah why would you
[5401.08 --> 5407.34]  i've genuinely never understood the appeal it's very weird but blow-up dolls yeah you're more of
[5407.34 --> 5412.94]  a real doll guy right i mean i probably if i was choosing between the two then yes yes he can afford
[5412.94 --> 5420.52]  it he won't buy shoes but like can he ever buy a real doll oh man that's funny
[5420.52 --> 5428.80]  uh to add more to people's search from tau what are your thoughts on blue light filtering glasses
[5428.80 --> 5437.32]  i think that they seem to filter some of the blue light and that there seems to be some evidence that
[5437.32 --> 5443.32]  that could be good how good um whether it's worth the money or the inconvenience of wearing glasses if
[5443.32 --> 5450.10]  you don't already need them that i don't know i personally don't bother with them um
[5450.10 --> 5456.80]  yeah no me neither and that's i thought they were really interesting when i first heard them me too
[5456.80 --> 5463.28]  um i tried them and then i tried them and seemed like they might help a little but it's it's so hard
[5463.28 --> 5469.88]  to tell like it's so hard to tell because there's no way to run a controlled experiment to know if they're
[5469.88 --> 5476.36]  working for you it's all completely subjective really hard to trial as far as i know as well
[5477.08 --> 5485.44]  from max any updates on the spammer you called last week no i got a message back from them and then i was
[5485.44 --> 5493.72]  lazy they asked me to send them the comment that and i was like oh i could go check the wan archive and i
[5493.72 --> 5499.40]  could go find the and i could go into my youtube dashboard and i could go look for that comment
[5499.40 --> 5506.32]  but it's my weekend so i didn't i'm sorry i know i said i would because they want to rope you and they
[5506.32 --> 5513.04]  want you to they want to get you to do things for them yeah that is not difficult to do and then
[5513.04 --> 5517.86]  eventually the the next because because you you there's there's this like mental concept thing
[5517.86 --> 5523.68]  whereas as you do tasks for people and as people do tasks for you there's like trust built
[5523.68 --> 5530.14]  oh okay regardless basically of what the task is so am i just too lazy to get scammed in this case
[5530.14 --> 5535.34]  yeah i guess so nice yeah nice yeah nice
[5535.34 --> 5545.64]  from anon my 16 month internship at amd has shown me the fact that pc hardware is insanely complex and
[5545.64 --> 5550.26]  is a miracle that it works yeah is there anything about cpu or gpu design that is just black magic
[5550.26 --> 5554.56]  to you and you would love to know how it works is designed etc all of it i was gonna say the whole
[5554.56 --> 5560.02]  thing i love it it's super cool it's it's one of those things where i'm i know i'm not smart enough
[5560.02 --> 5566.28]  to make it so i just sit here and publicly love it lots that's literally my job
[5566.28 --> 5576.86]  yeah from those bagels what did you think of devour's cpu contact frame and would you suggest it to
[5576.86 --> 5584.92]  others or is it snake oil asks those bagel uh i don't think roman would ever try to sell anyone's
[5584.92 --> 5591.92]  snake oil and yes it works it does what he says it does i don't know that i would recommend it just
[5591.92 --> 5599.68]  because it will void your warranty assuming you tell anybody you used it um so i you know i don't
[5599.68 --> 5605.22]  want to i don't want to take a position on that but we have validated on multiple instances using
[5605.22 --> 5611.84]  different kinds of coolers that it does in fact work cool or haha
[5611.84 --> 5618.18]  but yeah derbauer is legit he's not gonna sell you oops i accidentally curated the wrong thing
[5618.18 --> 5623.72]  uh do we have any more topics we want to talk about i don't really know let's let's skim through
[5623.72 --> 5628.08]  i could talk about some of the cool lab stuff that's in that video i think they should watch the
[5628.08 --> 5633.78]  video yeah they can but like the automated game benchmarking the automated like keyboard tester
[5633.78 --> 5641.90]  dude out of a jig yeah watch the video yeah man we're gonna be able to test like okay did you know
[5641.90 --> 5647.72]  that active noise cancelling headphones will compensate if you're wearing glasses and there's like
[5647.72 --> 5654.92]  whoa no i didn't that your base response sucks huh yeah they have like pressure sensors or something
[5654.92 --> 5659.98]  no but they have a microphone inside so if they figure out hey we're not getting enough bass in
[5659.98 --> 5666.88]  here they'll boost it huh so cool right smart when you really start diving into the like the
[5666.88 --> 5672.46]  engineering of things it gets you yeah it's it's that whole like you don't know enough to know that
[5672.46 --> 5684.46]  you don't know enough concept holy crap what we're announcing the whale land event yeah okay july 29th
[5684.46 --> 5692.56]  6 p.m to july 31st 10 a.m you heard it here first there will be approximately 200 tickets available
[5692.56 --> 5700.10]  they will go live later next week the location will be new new lab or lab 2 depending on which name you
[5700.10 --> 5708.18]  prefer for it so just right near the office here uh there will be linus power hour game of the hour
[5708.18 --> 5714.46]  oh okay events include linus power hour so game of the hour where you have no choice but to play the
[5714.46 --> 5718.78]  game that i decide is an hour long enough yeah i think so because there's setup time right
[5718.78 --> 5726.26]  it'll start like we'll figure it out i think an hour is long enough as long as we're actually
[5726.26 --> 5729.54]  playing for an hour are you are you are these like back to back like how does how does the
[5729.54 --> 5734.92]  linus power no there will be gaps of do whatever you want in between linus okay sweet then it's
[5734.92 --> 5739.34]  then it's great there will also be tournaments and challenges for prizes i want to cast a rocket
[5739.34 --> 5742.68]  league tournament there will be food and drink options you should let you should let chase know
[5742.68 --> 5748.16]  then yeah uh there will be an ltdstore.com merch booth maybe some other booths and members of our team
[5748.16 --> 5755.22]  will be at the event um i don't know that any of them will be like paid to be there so i can't
[5755.22 --> 5760.68]  guarantee that they'll be there or that they will stay or whatever else if it's boring then you'll
[5760.68 --> 5767.18]  have to just excuse them for off and going home um they may decide to sleep at home because they
[5767.18 --> 5773.38]  live around here or whatever else i'm gonna stay as much as i can but yeah i i don't i'm not quite
[5773.38 --> 5777.72]  the whippersnapper i once was i don't think i'm gonna be able to stay up on friday morning when i have
[5777.72 --> 5782.50]  to start work do wan show and everything and then stay all the way up until sunday at 10 a.m i might
[5782.50 --> 5787.18]  have been able to do that at one time yeah no not now if i do that now i'll be i'll be out for
[5787.18 --> 5792.06]  like two weeks no i would i would like i would definitely come down with something yeah exactly i
[5792.06 --> 5798.46]  reached a point around 25 i guess where i just i started getting a sick every time i pulled an
[5798.46 --> 5802.28]  all-nighter every single time nivon would be like look are you not seeing the pattern here i'm
[5802.28 --> 5810.40]  like no i have no pattern i can't do that anyway super exciting i asked the float plane the local
[5810.40 --> 5814.08]  float plane guys i'll extend it to the rest of them but i asked the local float plane guys like
[5814.08 --> 5820.12]  hey do you guys want to go in they're like yes so they'll be there which is gonna be cool yeah that
[5820.12 --> 5826.78]  could be a problem what we have 80 employees and approximately 200 seats at this land are we even
[5826.78 --> 5834.70]  gonna sell any tickets i think there's i think there's 50 reserved okay all right cool well that's
[5834.70 --> 5839.80]  good like i don't mean out of the 200 i mean i believe our actual maximum capacity is 250
[5839.80 --> 5845.66]  okay okay all right people are saying that they they don't they can't get off work and travel with
[5845.66 --> 5851.74]  that little notice um don't take this the wrong way but we kind of did that on purpose this is not ltx
[5851.74 --> 5860.24]  no this is not a worth traveling for spectacle wait for ltx if you're not local this is intended for
[5860.24 --> 5867.04]  people who are at most maybe driving up from seattle aj asked can we play from the main ltt office
[5867.04 --> 5873.12]  what you're just gonna like hide no you're gonna fly all the way over here and then hide in a
[5873.12 --> 5879.90]  separate building play world of warcraft over in the office while everyone else is no yeah world of
[5879.90 --> 5887.08]  warcraft will be banned we should do we should do like like some form of like uh router rules that
[5887.08 --> 5892.84]  block certain like mmos and stuff and it's just like no you need to play land games i'd be super
[5892.84 --> 5900.34]  i'd be super extra down yeah anything else we oh yeah there was the whole uh the m2 macbook pro
[5900.34 --> 5906.64]  teardown confirms it's basically an m1 i fixed it tore down an m2 macbook pro in a recent video
[5906.64 --> 5912.10]  cables standoff screws grounding pins etc all the same uh the logic board though is a little different
[5912.10 --> 5917.78]  and supports the m2 chip uh the one the heatsink has square corners rather than rounded ones
[5917.78 --> 5923.48]  ooh the only major change aside from the chip is actually a downgrade the storage on the entry level
[5923.48 --> 5929.04]  m2 is slower than the m1 due to uh the different configuration of the ssd so it has fewer nand chips
[5929.04 --> 5935.14]  which means that reading and writing in parallel is no longer possible this is only true for the base
[5935.14 --> 5939.64]  model though this is the part that i thought was interesting sounds like you should be able to take an
[5939.64 --> 5947.38]  m2 board and just stuff it into your m1 macbook pro right wrong i fix it tried this and made the swap
[5947.38 --> 5954.22]  successfully but the trackpad keyboard and touch id sensor no longer functioned post swap thank you tim
[5954.22 --> 5963.48]  apple very cool discussion question here why would apple so blatantly and unnecessarily block repairability
[5963.48 --> 5971.32]  if someone had a failed logic board in an m1 macbook pro why couldn't they just put an m2 logic
[5971.32 --> 5978.28]  board in there hooked up to their old battery and screen and everything else because f**k you yeah
[5978.28 --> 5981.54]  that's pretty much it there's there's really nothing other than they just want you to buy
[5981.54 --> 5988.62]  new computers that that's it hey yeah yeah yeah i could get into it i could get more mad but that's
[5988.62 --> 5993.32]  that's all that is coming down to you they don't care if you waste a bunch of stuff they want you to
[5993.32 --> 6003.06]  buy new computers also sort of relatively breaking news uh as expected elon musk pulled out of his
[6003.06 --> 6009.58]  twitter purchase deal and is getting a lot of much sued by a the twins yeah
[6009.58 --> 6017.60]  i don't know if you read the story either uh let's just talk about the twitter thing though i i didn't
[6017.60 --> 6022.12]  know anything about this uh until you mentioned it when you first allegedly allegedly twins
[6022.12 --> 6028.30]  let's just say allegedly everything um but but yeah allegedly he's trying to pull out of this
[6028.30 --> 6034.50]  twitter deal and then twitter was like we will bring legal action blah blah blah yeah you must buy us
[6034.50 --> 6042.98]  yeah or at the very least boy could he ever get sued for a lot because on the one hand i think the
[6042.98 --> 6047.48]  it's like stock manipulation there's a pullout yeah there's a pullout clause of the deal that would
[6047.48 --> 6052.68]  cost him a billion but then twitter could also probably sue for very significant damages because
[6052.68 --> 6061.04]  of all the stock uh price movement that has taken place all of the um the sort of intangible damage
[6061.04 --> 6068.34]  that has been done by employees leaving and um just general unrest at twitter that's taken place because
[6068.34 --> 6077.52]  of this whole saga this is going to be this is going to be interesting there's some folks jumping
[6077.52 --> 6082.98]  into uh chat saying well they lied on their numbers so he would win anyway yeah it's not going to be that
[6082.98 --> 6091.94]  straightforward boys gonna be a pretty complicated one wait musk pulled out he recently tweeted letting
[6091.94 --> 6097.04]  everyone know he's not pulling out anymore sorry what is this i'm seeing news articles from 40 minutes
[6097.04 --> 6104.10]  ago saying that he pulled out uh i don't even know what his twitter handle when we're just using
[6104.10 --> 6110.20]  it's probably just elon musk well it probably is except oh yeah it is okay when when we're when we're
[6110.20 --> 6115.50]  just using the term pull out this gets a little confusing based on recent musk news yeah i know right
[6115.50 --> 6122.92]  because he was also tweeting recently about like doing his part for the u.s uh birth rate yes so like if
[6122.92 --> 6129.36]  people are referring to that like yeah maybe you know maybe he's still all up in there stay classy
[6129.36 --> 6136.98]  elon all right and you guys stay classy until we see you next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[6136.98 --> 6144.70]  how are we going to deal with wan and the land wan land yeah we're going to do it from there or we're
[6144.70 --> 6147.34]  going to do it from here and then just go over there oh yeah we'll do it here
[6147.34 --> 6167.02]  oh hold on a second we can't end just yet sierras 13 asks at luke hammer update
[6167.02 --> 6175.46]  i can look you should look the last time i looked it had been over a year and there was no update so
[6175.46 --> 6186.58]  this is gonna take me like a while i can just check for next show okay yeah i'll check for next
[6186.58 --> 6192.02]  show but there's almost certainly no update i think it might actually be abandoned now but we'll see
[6192.02 --> 6195.78]  this thing gonna like work at all or oh there we go
