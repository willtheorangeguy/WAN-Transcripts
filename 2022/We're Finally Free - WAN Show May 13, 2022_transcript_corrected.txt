[0.00 → 5.28] now would it be that if someone bought two items at once ah maybe we should really start the show
[5.28 → 10.32] welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[10.32 → 16.96] we're going to be talking about nice hash I mean probably not single-handedly but NVIDIA's mining
[16.96 → 24.88] limiter finally being defeated just in time for no one to care about mining at all ever again
[24.88 → 31.52] also in NVIDIA news NVIDIA has released open source GPU drivers for Linux kind of
[33.36 → 39.60] what else we got today pretty big caveat on the end of that um google AYO 2022
[40.80 → 46.96] AI oh AYO why is it AYO I don't know anyway google stuff Google News we're gonna talk about google
[46.96 → 54.72] hardware and bye bye iPod really is that news uh what else is news wait where's all the stuff
[54.72 → 60.00] I wanted to talk about not here what I don't understand do you want to just riff it do you
[60.00 → 64.16] want to just do it live I'm going to have to riff some stuff all right no it's going in blind let's roll
[64.16 → 74.64] that intro we're doing it boys
[76.80 → 82.64] I know it's Io that's why I correct you in the doc it's like a wire
[82.64 → 95.12] the show is brought to you by vulture XSplit and I missed the third one, but it's there who was it
[95.12 → 101.84] and they Squarespace thanks bell why don't we jump right into our first topic nice hash has finally
[101.84 → 109.04] cracked the last of NVIDIA's defences fully unlocking the full hash rate for NVIDIA GPUs that were launched
[109.04 → 114.32] with v bios hash rate limiters which we called well yeah of course people told us because we were
[114.32 → 122.72] not so we were wrong well those people were so many people I hope you remember who you are guys
[123.44 → 129.12] there's literally billions of dollars at stake there's so much money there's you gotta
[129.12 → 134.64] be joking unless it was like soldered off somehow which doesn't even make any sense well you could you
[134.64 → 138.48] could well yeah no you wouldn't any you wouldn't be able to do that because then you wouldn't be able
[138.48 → 142.96] to use those functional components of the GPU for other workloads and their performance would suck and
[142.96 → 147.84] they wouldn't be competitive yeah yeah but unless you could do that like if it's a software lock there's
[147.84 → 153.28] so much money so like unfathomable amounts of money it's at the point where and I'm not saying I'm not
[153.28 → 159.84] saying this is how it happened because I don't know how it works nice hash has not explained how the
[159.84 → 167.12] unlock works, but it's at the point where you know the kinds of the kinds of crypto billionaires that
[167.12 → 175.84] are out there that could just be like okay whatever engineer at NVIDIA created this here is literally
[175.84 → 184.00] a gigantic bag of money you can retire you work for me now yeah and your entire job forever is to undo
[184.00 → 189.60] that thing you did, and then you retire on an island like that's the that's the kind of money that we're
[189.60 → 195.92] talking about here guys there was absolutely no way that this was not going to be cracked uh
[196.48 → 203.60] timing of it though is is is quite entertaining um because it coincides like directly with the crash
[203.60 → 212.40] yeah I mean I guess that's okay because it means that anyone buying the dip and picking up cheap cards
[212.40 → 218.48] also as far as my very vague not informed understanding goes yeah people on nice hash right now
[218.48 → 223.68] that are like selling their mining power is still making some money are they okay well there you go
[223.68 → 230.00] apparently they weren't the first to do it uh this is from this is from float plane chat NB minor apparently
[230.00 → 237.28] did it first I do know that the defences have been slowly crumbling ever since NVIDIA first introduced
[237.28 → 244.08] their light hash rate GPUs and i have to give NVIDIA credit it took longer to break through them than I thought
[244.08 → 249.92] uh it's been a year since they launched the RTX 3060 with a light hash rate limiter there is
[249.92 → 256.88] is some people pointing to the lapsus stuff and wondering how much of that is related it could be
[256.88 → 263.60] quite related the NVIDIA leak yeah um I think that you know well okay we'll talk about that in a little
[263.60 → 270.32] bit more depth when we open up our next topic here um nice hash has not explained how to unlock
[270.32 → 274.40] works instead linking to queen's a kind of magic music video
[277.12 → 286.80] it's not all good news it only works at this time it only works on Windows and only using hash eat
[286.80 → 294.16] it uh well i this might dagger Hashimoto okay there that's okay and as of today the RTX 3050 and 3080 12
[294.16 → 300.72] gig cards are both still locked so it's not every GPU that this is working on however suspicious the
[300.72 → 309.84] timing is um it's really only relevant at this point to miners looking to squeeze extra value out of cards
[309.84 → 314.24] that they already have because the price of crypto has been crashing to the point where I don't think
[314.24 → 322.24] even the most fervent cryptocurrency enthusiasts would be telling you to go out and buy GPUs
[322.80 → 334.16] explicitly for mining right now I mean Ethereum uh is down from a high of 31 063 us to 2067 and bitcoin
[334.88 → 340.48] was at a high of 41 532 hold on that is that the one-month-high oh that's only the one-month-high yeah
[340.48 → 346.96] was that like 60 000 a while ago anyway it's at 30 000 now so we have seen a significant crash
[348.88 → 356.16] oh this is great who wrote this gotta be Anthony uh many stable coins fixed to the US dollar says
[356.16 → 363.04] Anthony have been destabilized as assets are shuffled slash extracted in response can I
[363.04 → 372.08] just take a moment to shout out that stable coins were always a scam i I read the name read like a
[372.08 → 376.32] one or two liners on the premise and was like I don't get it don't see how it works and then just
[376.32 → 383.28] bailed out but that that's after I had already pulled out entirely so I don't know oh man it's
[383.28 → 388.80] interesting some analysts see bitcoin's price history as proof that it will be able to bounce back but
[388.80 → 399.28] I mean how much um i I think markets in general are yes to be turning down we should be fair bitcoin
[400.00 → 404.32] and Ethereum are far from the only things crashing right now you looked at Netflix
[407.20 → 412.32] a lot of tech stocks a lot of tech stocks over the last five six months seen Shopify over the last
[412.32 → 417.04] six months I got nailed hey Shopify we're rooting for you to still exist by the way because yeah that'd be
[417.04 → 422.32] great I really don't want to make a store our store actually runs on your platform we do kind of still
[422.32 → 429.60] see it I desperately do not want to have to try to make that um please keep existing um they
[429.60 → 435.76] seem like they're doing fine I think like internally okay I won't say too much but I think they're doing
[435.76 → 439.84] fine well didn't they already I thought I read an article saying that Shopify was planning to like do
[439.84 → 445.76] stock buybacks like executives were planning to buy stocks so clearly they have some confidence yeah and i
[445.76 → 453.44] I mean out of a lot of like tech companies they seem to have a lot more like you know realness to
[453.44 → 457.04] them they have a lot of money going through their platform and like something like twitter which is
[457.04 → 462.32] just like how does this any what nope i I must have been reading about someone else that's not uh
[465.04 → 469.76] this is okay so I can't find my source for that Conrad just said in float plane chat and this, so this is a
[469.76 → 477.36] external developer well internal to us external to Shopify um that works on Shopify stuff, and he said
[477.36 → 481.60] Shopify is so nice I hope we never have to use something else hearing that from an external
[481.60 → 486.96] developer should mean a lot for the company that it is said about yeah they could also do better well yeah
[486.96 → 493.76] okay definitely agreed there are a lot of things that Shopify could do better like to be clear Shopify
[493.76 → 501.44] great partner we use the platform they've sponsored us in the past Shopify could do better there's
[501.44 → 505.92] some problems there's some there's some problems, but yeah there's definitely some
[505.92 → 512.00] problems we've had to like change roadmaps and plans and stuff based on what's going on
[512.00 → 520.24] targets not getting hit by but Shopify it is what it is um there are a lot of different articles about a
[520.24 → 525.68] lot of different things right now uh in relation to like coins crashing and general stocks crashing
[525.68 → 530.88] and everything else uh there's an article from forbs talking about how apparently a trillion dollars
[530.88 → 540.24] in value has just been wiped out who that's a big number it's almost like it was all imaginary money
[541.84 → 548.88] who would have thunk it I think um yeah I don't know I don't think I can say way too much on this
[548.88 → 558.08] topic i just I almost wish it didn't crash so hard that makes sense why I mean to be clear I'm not
[558.08 → 563.28] saying it should have crashed harder I'm just I'm just asking i I don't think it would be good for it
[563.28 → 572.00] to cease to like practically exist if that makes sense like the stock market basically because there's
[572.00 → 576.96] stories I don't want to get way too into various things, but there are stories like uh to throw Ukraine for
[576.96 → 582.96] an example there are stories of people like buying cars in Ukraine with bitcoin after the
[582.96 → 587.52] local banks had entirely locked everything down so people with Ukrainian credit cards could not make
[587.52 → 592.24] purchases right so they purchased cars with bitcoin in order to get out of the country which is like
[593.28 → 601.20] that's pretty cool yeah like that i so I don't know um i i I think it was kind of
[602.16 → 606.88] to the mooning a little hard I think everything in that area was to the mooning a little hard
[606.88 → 611.60] so I'm happy that maybe it's coming back down to earth I mean but I hope we hit a more this has been
[611.60 → 617.04] a ridiculous I'm I don't even want to call it a bull run I mean it's been pretty clear that we've been
[617.04 → 624.48] in a bubble for quite some time and there is a benefit to you to the valuation of companies and
[624.48 → 630.80] the valuation of their stocks having some kind of fundamental basis in reality as opposed to just
[630.80 → 636.32] being pure tulip bulb speculation there's always that what you're kind of talking about with Shopify
[636.32 → 642.40] right like if is the public determines that your company's worth like nothing, and you're one of the
[642.40 → 647.20] like people who run that company you can just be like oh sweet yeah I'll buy this up because we are
[647.20 → 652.56] going to be worth something so I can, I will back that up myself, and then you add you you you retain that
[652.56 → 658.88] the kind of minimum value times like this make me just so grateful that we do not have any outside
[658.88 → 664.48] money in our company because I'm looking at it going okay maybe a recession maybe depression maybe
[665.04 → 669.04] there's a lot of spooky stuff on the horizon there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff going on in the world
[669.04 → 677.76] right now but what I know for sure is that as long as we can stay in our little in our little corner
[677.76 → 683.68] of this chaotic universe spinning around at a zillion miles an hour through the cosmos
[684.24 → 690.64] then we should be okay there 's's not an external factor like uh there could never be a
[690.64 → 696.96] hostile takeover yeah of Linus media group you know you could never have some billionaire come in and say
[696.96 → 703.68] okay I'm going to go straight to your I'm going to go straight to your shareholders and I'm going to offer
[703.68 → 711.36] them 10 or 20 more than what the stock is worth where it's being publicly traded and I now own your
[711.36 → 716.16] company that is actually impossible they would have to negotiate with Yvonne I was going to say
[716.16 → 722.24] they have to go through good luck that's true dude I don't know if you have enough billions of dollars
[723.60 → 728.16] she's she's a really it's a good person to have on your team she can be a very tough negotiator
[728.16 → 733.76] is what I'll say both having been married to her for a thousand years and working with her for a
[733.76 → 742.64] thousand years um she's one of those people that I don't it's not that she doesn't understand that
[742.64 → 749.76] there needs to be a give and take in a negotiation it's that I'm not sure that she cares she's like
[749.76 → 755.12] well whatever you're supposed to get out of it you better negotiate for that I'm not advocating for it
[755.12 → 761.76] what about my stuff okay all right fair enough lady to be clear she's a very wonderful
[761.76 → 768.80] lady I'm just really glad that in the cage fight she's in my corner not the other one speaking of
[768.80 → 776.72] cage fight this is totally off-topic yeah are you going to watch tomorrow watch what uh crater clash oh i
[776.72 → 784.40] I definitely should, I definitely should I I haven't been interested in any of the celebrity or creator
[784.40 → 789.52] boxing matches or anything at all yeah until this one and now I'm like actually really still just
[789.52 → 795.92] because the roster's the roster's so cool yeah it's just like a bunch of people here's what I want to
[795.92 → 803.28] know okay I'm dr mike yeah I presumably took some kind of oath to do no harm am I actually allowed to
[803.28 → 811.76] pummel the stuffing out of someone I don't I don't know it would be okay so yeah no I'm serious right now
[811.76 → 815.28] well I think that's I think that's a different thing because you're not oh because it's for
[815.28 → 821.52] entertainment now it's okay I mean you know he's not he's not practicing medicine you know in a
[821.52 → 828.08] boxing match okay I think that's fair yeah so wait literally so as long as a doctor is not actually
[828.08 → 833.04] practicing medicine then it's fine for them to just beat the crap out of people about combat
[833.04 → 838.24] medics that like carry firearms I don't know i I don't know I don't know the rules do I look like a
[838.24 → 845.12] doctor to you, i i I mean I don't either I haven't exactly dove into it, I would probably be horrible
[845.12 → 852.24] at that profession um but i I have to assume that it has to tie in directly with uh practicing
[852.24 → 856.88] medicine dr mike apparently has a video discussing it okay I missed that as far as my understanding
[856.88 → 862.24] goes he like has actually been training boxing for like a long time cool then this will be very
[862.24 → 867.36] interesting yeah I'm glad I'm not fighting him then seeing some of the people involved
[867.36 → 872.96] yeah i I don't know I think it's going to be fascinating that's it uh ed nutting asks does leg
[872.96 → 880.64] not have any debt financing mortgage loan etc are you really at no risk we are at a very acceptable
[880.64 → 885.52] level of risk I think pretty much every business is going to have some level of risk we could never
[885.52 → 894.64] under any circumstances lose our main HQ um right now pretty solid fallback yeah right now we're a
[894.64 → 902.40] little vulnerable on the lab we just took out financing against the lab um and theoretically
[902.40 → 911.28] if something truly catastrophic were to happen actually yeah I'd be really, really difficult it'd be
[911.28 → 918.08] really difficult for anything to happen real estate wise to wipe us out and even if interest rates shot
[918.08 → 926.80] up we are in such a position that long before we would run into any kind of inability to pay our monthly
[926.80 → 934.16] payments um the entire Canadian economy would have collapsed like that unless interest rates shot to 60
[934.16 → 942.72] 50 or something like that uh it's all manageable I mean our main expenses are payroll and
[942.72 → 947.52] that's our main priority is making sure that we can cover payroll month to month everything else is
[948.16 → 954.72] like the 20 gigabit internet connection that I'm looking into is secondary it actually would cost only as
[954.72 → 962.32] much as our current 10 gigabit connection oh, but it's not quite as baller a connection so we're we're Jake's
[962.32 → 966.64] looking into it Jake's looking into if it's from an all it's from an alternate provider but then our
[966.64 → 972.40] existing provider item has been making some spicy offers so we're we're trying to we're trying to
[972.40 → 980.96] figure out what our best path forward is here the one thing that I know for sure is that I want a direct
[980.96 → 986.32] connection between this building and the lab and that's either going to happen officially or it's going
[986.32 → 992.64] to happen unofficially teasing future content by the way beautiful i someone in chat sorry just
[992.64 → 998.08] someone in chat asked uh about the job postings from last week they have been up since Monday as i
[998.08 → 1004.80] said please check them out we've had people apply already to all the positions uh there is a problem
[1004.80 → 1010.64] which I was informed about today that apparently the new system that we're using on the site for
[1010.64 → 1015.60] jobs is not accepting international phone numbers, but we are allowing remotes for some of the positions
[1015.60 → 1020.64] oh okay we should figure that out I'm going to email the person who manages that stuff
[1020.64 → 1024.48] and hopefully it will be fixed I mean they're probably like going to be gone for the day by
[1024.48 → 1031.20] the time they get that so I would check Monday again got it but yeah you can also
[1033.36 → 1038.32] yeah never mind Brazil asks does that mean that the wireless internet sharing didn't work so well it
[1038.32 → 1044.16] worked great, but that's for creator warehouse they don't need they don't need to review you know high
[1044.16 → 1049.84] bit rate 8k footage or whatever on their workstations from the server room in the other building that's
[1049.84 → 1056.08] not necessary they are literally just using it for internet and like maybe saving Adobe Illustrator
[1056.08 → 1061.76] projects stuff like that this is so we might be putting a rack in creator warehouse
[1062.40 → 1069.36] um because there's a project that AJ nick another person I don't know if I can say their name and I are working on
[1069.36 → 1073.28] on where they might have to have a server physically on location
[1075.44 → 1081.20] just so you know what who needs a server on location create a warehouse they need a server
[1081.20 → 1089.12] yeah in they're the business team the business team for this like archaic software thing that
[1089.12 → 1097.92] it's just they just need apparently like and like an intranet server pretty much yeah I hate it
[1099.20 → 1103.20] I mean it could be somewhere can you just explain this it could be somewhere else, but it has to be on
[1103.20 → 1109.84] LAN and uh I while you could solve that problem it would probably just make the most sense to put it
[1109.84 → 1117.76] over there how top secret is this I don't think we should say the name of the thing all right yeah well i
[1117.76 → 1122.24] hate it that might not even be a problem I just don't want to just in case I hate it and I think
[1122.24 → 1133.12] it's stupid okay, okay we're doing it so thanks glad we got that sorted out let's talk about NVIDIA's
[1133.12 → 1139.52] open source GPU drivers for Linux now this was written up by Anthony as well so I'm fairly certain
[1139.52 → 1146.40] that this is already in there but can I just say that the timing of this is also extremely suspicious
[1146.40 → 1153.28] does this feel like NVIDIA just getting out ahead of well everything leaked already anyway so since
[1153.28 → 1161.04] it's out there anyway we might as well just do it anyway I mean it's possible it's possible that this
[1161.04 → 1168.24] is more of a response to the steam deck uh some people in full plane chat have actually guessed what
[1168.24 → 1174.96] it is that's amazing um i yeah I thought it was an answer to steam deck that was my knee-jerk to this
[1174.96 → 1181.44] that's that's possible as well I mean you said makes sense NVIDIA just allowing AMD to have pretty
[1181.44 → 1187.04] much all the market share of Linux gamers because remember steam deck is not going to be
[1187.04 → 1193.76] the only handheld and as soon as steam OS actually launches is available more broadly we're going to
[1193.76 → 1198.88] see not just handhelds steam machines are going to become a freaking thing yeah you're going to have
[1198.88 → 1207.44] steam machines in people's living rooms because why not license exactly libraries there
[1207.44 → 1213.60] anyway and so by not allowing the open source community to contribute to their drivers NVIDIA is
[1213.60 → 1218.08] going to be giving up performance they're going to be giving up features it's going to be costing them
[1218.08 → 1223.44] more because they just need to do all the maintenance and so maybe they've finally figured out that this
[1223.44 → 1228.00] tide is turning, and they need to just get with the program all right do you want to run us through what
[1228.00 → 1232.96] Anthony actually wrote up so that that's it that's my hot take on this I swear no, no hot takes today
[1232.96 → 1238.80] yeah so it's its been nearly a decade since the Linus Torvalds famous uh giving the fingers which I can't
[1238.80 → 1245.68] press a bleep button for a gesture so uh yeah can we blur can you blur on the fly bell not yet
[1245.68 → 1253.84] whoa yeah very nice it's been nearly a decade since uh Linus Torvalds did that um and now the open
[1253.84 → 1260.80] source drivers are apparently available as an alpha it's not really quite as simple as they're out
[1260.80 → 1265.60] there everything about them is open source, and it's all hunky-dory uh because of course it's not
[1265.60 → 1271.52] because it's from NVIDIA uh, so there are caveats the caveats are the drivers will only work on Turing
[1271.52 → 1278.72] or RTX 20 or later GPUs thanks to reliance on the GPU system processor uh included in that generation
[1278.72 → 1282.32] and only the kernel module is open source at the moment
[1284.88 → 1290.32] cool user space modules and utilities are all still closed source, so this should help things
[1290.32 → 1296.24] be more stable there were some notes later on yeah according to Wendell this is a situation is 90
[1296.24 → 1301.60] the same but NVIDIA is trying to do it the right way and this isn't really a win for open source but
[1301.60 → 1307.60] it is for usability so it's uh there 's's a cool quote here that is this is for users not the neck beards
[1308.72 → 1316.00] which is still good but not as good not really what I think basically everyone wanted but still
[1316.00 → 1322.48] a good thing I mean that's kind of NVIDIA's MO yeah it's good, and you'll buy it, but it isn't what you
[1322.48 → 1328.80] want it's really not what you're looking for uh so I mean hopefully this is a step in the right direction
[1328.80 → 1336.56] hopefully this is not the end um and yeah I think that's about it okay um
[1338.88 → 1343.12] open source drivers should finally allow for the fully open source Nouméa driver to properly use
[1343.12 → 1348.72] newer GPUs aside from features NVIDIA previously blocked like locking the GPU minimum clocks for
[1348.72 → 1354.80] example man okay so it sounds to me like unless NVIDIA does the work which they probably won't
[1355.36 → 1361.92] AMD is still going to have an enormous advantage on Linux like looking at the way that valve has been able to
[1361.92 → 1372.08] tune the the the but well actually both the CPU and the GPU of the steam deck like oh wow it's way
[1372.08 → 1377.60] better it's like way better they are going to be hampered unless they open it up it's its it's just
[1377.60 → 1382.64] i I think the quote is actually quite good this is for users not neck beards this is going to simplify
[1382.64 → 1389.28] things yeah mostly i that's that's my take on it is it's mostly just a simplification of the process
[1389.28 → 1392.88] it should make things a little bit easier it's not necessarily going to make things significantly
[1392.88 → 1400.80] better I'd love to know what Anthony thinks is the reason so it's most important yeah most early
[1400.80 → 1406.00] speculation revolves around NVIDIA's motivations for doing this so here are the ones that Anthony
[1406.00 → 1411.92] provides we should do a poll should we do a poll yeah is raw poll going to let me down again uh do dot com
[1411.92 → 1420.00] oh okay the dot com one is not garbage seems to be still working to create a poll okay why did NVIDIA
[1420.00 → 1428.40] do this wait description okay here are some answers i just gotta grab these uh lapsus uh staying
[1428.40 → 1436.72] okay the options are uh the hack by lapsus earlier this year okay so that's option number one we've got
[1436.72 → 1443.20] an attempt to stay relevant in the data centre as arc and radon pro ramp up hold on I'm actually
[1443.20 → 1450.40] going to copy and paste these so we can have exactly, exactly Anthony's wording we've got the option of an
[1450.40 → 1461.04] internal takeover by Linux enthusiasts I am imagining I'm imagining like a mutiny of Linux enthusiasts they have
[1461.04 → 1465.92] little Linux pirate flags at their they need to have by the way arch shirts and stuff like i
[1466.80 → 1472.16] i instead of a skull and crossbones it's like a penguin skull and crossbones I love it I love it i
[1472.80 → 1475.04] you know what I don't want to bias the results but
[1478.40 → 1484.48] from my experience dealing with NVIDIA people they drink the Kool-Aid pretty good over
[1484.48 → 1490.88] there i I doubt there was any kind of mutiny uh or coup and then what was the one that uh what was the one
[1490.88 → 1496.00] that I had said I forget did I say something different that wasn't this uh I think we both
[1496.00 → 1503.12] mentioned the steam deck oh yeah steam deck uh steam uh not seeding or that I think you were the one who
[1503.12 → 1512.16] said that not seeding Linux market share to am duh steam deck threat all right here we go create a pull
[1512.16 → 1524.64] um okay create pull okay let's see if this works it is definitely way more work to create a pull with
[1524.64 → 1532.24] this one but I guess I'll allow it oh this is interesting news we are SIMULA streaming to Facebook
[1532.24 → 1540.64] for the first time and unfortunately I showed up last minute for wan show and I did not get a chance to
[1540.64 → 1547.68] load up Facebook chat so that's a lot of chats to monitor I cannot post this to it, I have done that
[1549.52 → 1557.68] really where did you get the URL flow plane oh smart is this what it's like to have a producer
[1559.36 → 1566.08] I think so well I like it, I like it quite a lot all right let's have a look at the results here
[1566.08 → 1574.16] another and flow plane and twitch chat I need you guys to relax okay do they yeah they fight when i
[1574.16 → 1580.32] I'm your screen when I screen share they fight, and it's important for them to not fight because
[1581.04 → 1588.08] there's nothing to fight over guys flow plane chat is my favourite child you don't have to compete for
[1588.08 → 1594.24] my attention which you were never going to get it anyway yeah and flow plane you have nothing to prove
[1594.24 → 1598.88] on my side i I'm not as I'm not as uh nice to everyone as you, I only have flow plane chat i
[1598.88 → 1603.44] don't have anything else you just you don't even look at the other ones so wow for a while there i
[1603.44 → 1608.08] was actually really confused as to what was happening because randomly there'd just be all these arrows
[1608.96 → 1611.84] and I thought they were like talking about themselves because they were kind of pointing
[1611.84 → 1616.24] at their own usernames yeah and I was like what is why is everyone being so self-deprecating and
[1616.24 → 1620.56] than I finally figured out that this is happening, and it's going in both directions I'm
[1620.56 → 1630.32] like oh okay hilarious twitch is not impressed with you but see the thing is that Luke doesn't care
[1630.32 → 1636.72] because you're twitched yeah sorry yeah all right a sincere apology to Linus Torvalds has the lowest
[1636.72 → 1643.52] share of the vote which makes sense because there's no way there's no chance at all is there a Linus that
[1643.52 → 1652.32] NVIDIA is on good terms with right now oh man the next least likely according to the community is an
[1652.32 → 1657.60] internal takeover by Linux enthusiasts yeah i personally I'm on the same page as you guys a fun
[1657.60 → 1664.40] idea yeah it's definitely would be an amazing comedy sketch but other than that I don't think so
[1665.12 → 1669.92] I'm surprised at how few people think it's the lapsus hack and just getting out ahead of that I mean i
[1669.92 → 1679.52] guess based on how uh how base basic level the open sourcing ness of it is here um that that could
[1679.52 → 1686.40] be true that could be true that is not the case and the winner here by actually a significant margin
[1686.40 → 1693.12] is not wanting to see Linux market share to AMD seeing the steam deck and the momentum as a threat
[1693.12 → 1701.04] i think the data centre point has a lot of credence to it as well because like if you look
[1701.04 → 1707.76] at what NVIDIA has cared about over the last while data center is absolutely up there yeah uh my
[1707.76 → 1712.88] my knee-jerk was the steam deck thing honestly right now if I had to pick one I'd probably vote for the
[1712.88 → 1718.32] data centre one you think so not to like bail on my own idea but the second I read that data centre one
[1718.32 → 1725.12] I was like oh because you with so many things in life right follow the money yeah so it's like where's
[1725.12 → 1730.16] the money on this one is it losing steam deck whatever it's like yeah there 's's probably
[1730.16 → 1735.28] some there's some money there's real money there data centre though yeah there's a lot of real
[1735.28 → 1743.76] money there yeah like I mean we uh we checked out a system this week from Camino that has from Camino
[1743.76 → 1749.68] yeah a system from Camino yeah nice it's the company's called Camino that's cool wait is am I
[1749.68 → 1756.24] missing something isn't that where they like made clones uh no I don't think so Camino
[1758.24 → 1766.56] yeah really yeah in my defence Camino purged from the Jedi archives all evidence of the mysterious
[1766.56 → 1772.56] world of Camino was removed in my defence a lonely world beyond the outer rim it's been a moment since
[1772.56 → 1777.68] I've watched the prequel trilogy did I just Star Wars knowledge you oh yeah it hasn't happened many
[1777.68 → 1784.88] times I never claimed to be a big prequel trilogy nerd if you can is you can original trilogy or like
[1784.88 → 1789.36] early expanded universe out nerd me then I will be surprised even though it's been 20 years that's
[1789.36 → 1793.84] that's probably not yeah that's that's really going to be tough yeah but when it comes to anything
[1793.84 → 1799.68] newer like I haven't even seen clone wars I watched the animated series yeah I watched the first episode and
[1799.68 → 1808.16] it's pretty kitty Luke yeah it is really the whole thing is questionable there are parts that are really
[1808.16 → 1814.08] good got it i never I have never actually just sat down and watched it that's another note that it is
[1814.08 → 1818.48] kind of important it's always just been on yeah you've been like this is cool I like lasers I'm gonna
[1818.48 → 1823.92] do something else while this is on like a side monitor got it okay so we checked out the system from
[1823.92 → 1831.28] amino that has four NVIDIA a6000s in it and the whole time while we were playing around with it by
[1831.28 → 1836.88] the way you know the BMW blender render yeah okay it did it in like seven seconds
[1839.44 → 1847.20] okay, okay classroom oh man what was classroom no I'm afraid I think classroom was like 13 or 14. This is
[1847.20 → 1852.64] getting into like these are insane durations where you have to make a new test basically pretty much
[1852.64 → 1862.56] pretty much uh we ran classroom with uh instead of 300 samples 10 000 samples, and it went to like
[1862.56 → 1869.12] three minutes or something like that like it is actually ridiculous this is a fast system, and we went
[1869.12 → 1874.00] through this whole thing with it not knowing how much it cost because we were kind of sitting there
[1874.00 → 1878.72] going well I don't know that kind of takes some of the fun out of it right like who wants to know
[1878.72 → 1890.00] how much this crazy thing costs let's just look at it and go oh ah and at the end we started adding it
[1890.00 → 1899.12] up, and we realized that the CPUs for it were uh something like seven thousand dollars each like to give
[1899.12 → 1906.96] you guys some idea of how much money there is in the data centre space you know you think in your
[1906.96 → 1915.52] in your sheltered consumer mindset right you think a 500 CPU is very expensive, and you're right yeah it's
[1915.52 → 1925.04] a lot of money for processed sand right but in the data centre 500 that's not even worth writing a check
[1925.04 → 1932.32] for okay just to put it in perspective why are we ordering that low of a unit count exactly, exactly
[1932.32 → 1937.60] but let's just tack it on to our next order don't even bother it's not worth doing the paperwork
[1937.60 → 1942.96] so these CPUs are like seven thousand dollars each, and we go, and we look up these GPUs these a6000 by
[1942.96 → 1949.20] the time they're water blocked and integrated into this crazy render system they're like five six seven
[1949.20 → 1954.72] thousand dollars each, and it's got four of them in there, and you go on Camino's site, and they don't
[1954.72 → 1962.80] expect you to buy one of these okay you go on Camino's site for what is it the grand RM check
[1962.80 → 1968.96] this thing out, and they're like yeah and one of the really important features of it is that it's
[1968.96 → 1982.00] available as a grand MDC a container full of grands with a total power of up to what what
[1982.00 → 1989.84] is this is half a megawatt half a megawatt my friends oh my okay I just don't even know how to deal
[1989.84 → 1995.68] with this it's crazy I mean look at the cooling solution they built for this thing I'm sorry we're
[1995.68 → 2004.08] going back to my screen here like what the actual bananas is this racks on racks this is like
[2004.08 → 2011.04] it's like those mining containers except for you know actually doing something productive you know what I mean
[2012.00 → 2020.96] wow crazy right that is nuts so we got just one of these things, and we're utterly blown away
[2020.96 → 2026.08] by the performance of it and I forget how I got on this topic now man I was wondering like what oh the
[2026.08 → 2033.92] money in the data centre yeah money there's a lot of money and that gpu is not actually a ton more
[2033.92 → 2043.76] die area than what NVIDIA might put on something like a RTX 3080 ti okay so the cost from that
[2043.76 → 2049.28] standpoint is not that much higher it's higher because you got to understand as you increase
[2049.28 → 2054.80] the die area it's not just like oh this die is twice as big it costs twice as much because as you go
[2054.80 → 2061.44] twice as big the odds of an error go up by much, much more when you have fewer dies on a wafer
[2061.44 → 2068.24] uh, so the cost is significantly higher, but it sure is crap is not seven times higher now they are
[2068.24 → 2073.92] paying more for memory and NVIDIA does not make memory so they have to buy that from a third party
[2073.92 → 2078.56] but the margin on data centre GPUs is absolutely higher
[2080.96 → 2085.60] crazy wow I was wondering what people might use that for and then scroll down slightly on
[2085.60 → 2091.20] Camino's website to make sense like video production stuff yep um machine learning
[2091.20 → 2096.48] filming with Unreal Engine 5 as like the I believe if I remember correctly Mandalorian did a bunch of
[2096.48 → 2101.28] yes they did and like I wonder if the coolest thing about Mandalorian was how they filmed it
[2101.28 → 2109.84] no offence I'm sorry Mandalorian is a perfectly if you were desperate if you is every ounce of your
[2109.84 → 2115.52] being been crying out for Star Wars content then it probably felt great
[2118.00 → 2127.12] oh lee sun Kra asks what's that shirt I'm so glad what is that shirt dude we just launched a new shirt
[2127.12 → 2131.36] I hope you guys understand that when he shows up on set with a new shirt and I ask he won't tell me
[2131.36 → 2136.48] because he makes me wait until the show oh it's a screwdriver that makes it up this design yes so it
[2136.48 → 2142.80] actually is based on the Ltd screwdriver that's right we are not just monetizing the screwdriver
[2142.80 → 2147.52] as a screwdriver we are monetizing it as a fantastic design for sure and honestly that's one of the
[2147.52 → 2154.64] things I really love about Lloyd's designs is he manages to integrate the spirit of whatever object
[2154.64 → 2160.80] it is being it a CPU or fans or GPUs or headphones or whatever but just make it a shirt that's like
[2161.52 → 2167.52] palatable to wear you know that you yeah that you'd actually want to go out and be seen in so pictures
[2167.52 → 2172.72] feature uh one of our producer dudes one of our producer dude pretty sure I can see his name yeah he's
[2172.72 → 2179.84] been on camera damn I can't believe this made it as shot number two okay that's great uh we got Dennis
[2179.84 → 2187.84] in there Andy screwdriver bro Andy really wanted to do this shot with the mid-flip hey there's
[2187.84 → 2193.60] Dan you guys just met Dan for I think the first time anyway the screwdriver shirt is now available
[2193.60 → 2200.80] and I believe that's the only Ltd store news that I have for you guys the stealth sweatpants as well oh
[2201.84 → 2208.08] that explains why there was this big sales spike like an hour before the show I saw like a thing that
[2208.08 → 2212.32] went like that and I was like what what's going on I had I didn't dig into the report
[2212.88 → 2218.24] uh right sorry so hold on let me do you have that up already I do I'll just go to your screen
[2218.24 → 2226.56] then on an amazing photo wow who did that is that David yeah what super cool actually that's awesome
[2227.68 → 2232.88] is that the first one oh no you actually have to scroll down to see it yeah I love it
[2232.88 → 2240.80] it very cool so are these the same as structurally and everything just no orange accents
[2240.80 → 2248.64] I'm assuming um I believe so it looks like it but I'm not certain yes I believe so that's cool
[2249.84 → 2256.56] that's awesome all right let's go ahead and let's see if i got all these buttons here now we got
[2256.56 → 2262.48] we upgraded the production values shout out uh Dan and bell for getting that going PKK zippers three
[2262.48 → 2267.28] lengths for optimal fit uh cotton French terry fabric so the same as our blank hoodies
[2269.28 → 2276.08] um yeah yeah I guess that's pretty much uh everything we need to say about that for now

[2448.96 → 2454.72] image pasted in the dock you'll like it, you'll like it okay I don't I don't see the Linus
[2454.72 → 2459.44] thoughts banner but really uh hashtag Linus thoughts you don't see it all caps I'm going to highlight it
[2459.44 → 2464.08] oh there okay really helpful I was looking oh I missed I highlighted something else entirely I got it
[2464.08 → 2470.00] we're good yeah sure we go boys let's do it uh which part like the whole thing you know what let's do it
[2470.00 → 2474.96] after let's do a couple merch messages okay nice you guys aren't familiar we do not do super chats anymore
[2474.96 → 2481.12] we do merch messages and if you have a particularly thoughtful one then bell will flag it as a curated
[2481.12 → 2485.84] merch message and read it to us on the show so we can respond and if you're on Facebook we don't do
[2485.84 → 2490.80] that either whatever it's called oh okay don't know what it's called yep if we don't know what it's
[2490.80 → 2497.76] called odds are we're not going to reply to it no, so our first message is from Tommy uh it's their birthday
[2497.76 → 2506.40] happy birthday Tommy what are your most memorable birthday stories oh well it's got to be the time
[2506.40 → 2516.24] that my mom uh inflated what I mean I would, I must oh man I must have been I must have been like four
[2516.24 → 2524.32] it's one of my earliest memories I was really young wow, but it felt like hundreds of helium balloons
[2524.96 → 2530.72] uh filled our house like the entire ceiling it felt like to me as a small I mean maybe it wasn't
[2530.72 → 2535.68] that many if you're an adult, but it felt to me like our whole house which was a very small like
[2535.68 → 2540.48] low-income housing it was in a development called Abner willows back at the time I think it's changed
[2540.48 → 2546.80] names now I'm not sure, but it felt like the whole house was full of balloons with uh with streamers down
[2546.80 → 2553.44] and so it was like walking through a forest of like balloon tails and i could pull on them
[2553.44 → 2558.80] and like move them around and stuff that's that's one of my that's one of my earliest memories, and it's
[2558.80 → 2565.76] one of my favourite birthday memories that's cool for me um for pretty much all my birthdays in high
[2565.76 → 2571.28] school we used to have land parties at my parents house um and I mean we did it we did it basically
[2572.08 → 2577.44] every weekend regardless, but we would go like extra hard on birthdays and there was one year
[2577.44 → 2584.48] where we had a halo tournament set up, and we had a whole like uh ladder and everything, and it was
[2584.48 → 2589.28] it was awesome there were teams it was really cool, and we had one team playing out in the garage
[2589.28 → 2594.08] and one team playing in the house every time, and we had the boxes that worked together so that there
[2594.08 → 2598.32] was no screen peeking or anything, but you could hear each other yelling at each other because we leave the
[2598.32 → 2604.08] door open you know how that's always so fun oh it's the greatest part yeah, and it ended the
[2604.08 → 2610.40] whole tournament ended with one person with an uh I don't remember if it was a rocket launcher or a
[2610.40 → 2615.04] shotgun and I know the other person had a sword and they both came around the corner on each other and
[2615.04 → 2620.72] both like did their attack action at the same time and no one was really sure exactly what happened
[2620.72 → 2628.24] until the board came up so cool house just absolutely erupted it like it was awesome and then after that
[2628.24 → 2634.16] we grabbed like a bunch of lids to these big like uh containers yeah that we had we went to the
[2634.16 → 2640.32] local skate park, and it was all snowy, and we went down like the ramps in the skate park on lids as
[2640.32 → 2646.16] if there were sleds, and it was just it was just chaos yeah I love it but in like the best of ways man
[2646.80 → 2652.56] you didn't play worms Armageddon with us at the last land night you missed out bell were you in
[2652.56 → 2659.52] that game yes that was freaking crazy I heard you guys roaring well we barely know how to play because
[2659.52 → 2667.28] for most of us we've either never played or it's been 20 years yeah right so uh it was down to through
[2667.28 → 2673.60] just sheer ridiculousness because no one knows what they're doing sure it was down to me and who was
[2673.60 → 2680.24] still playing at that point I forget was it uh I think it was a new lab person one yeah I think it was
[2680.24 → 2686.96] one of the new labs people yeah no I know who it was yeah, yeah okay so I screwed up my finisher like we
[2686.96 → 2693.84] just had two worms left one each I screwed up my finisher, and it was over, and then he screwed up his
[2693.84 → 2702.32] finisher and like no one could believe it and then what happened on the last shot or something didn't
[2702.32 → 2707.76] I miss but then somehow it managed to like to kill him anyway or something like anyway it was a lot of
[2707.76 → 2713.04] ways stuff like that it was amazing man and there's just something about that atmosphere because
[2713.60 → 2720.88] in okay fall guys for example fall guys is a perfect example of a multiplayer game a party type
[2720.88 → 2726.72] game where as soon as you're knocked out you are completely disengaged from the game but that
[2726.72 → 2731.44] doesn't happen at a land because you have nowhere else to go and nothing else to do so everyone turns
[2731.44 → 2736.16] into spectators so when you play a seven-person match I think it was seven six or seven I can't
[2736.16 → 2743.20] remember you play a six-person match, and you've got everyone whose still who's out of it going ah just
[2743.20 → 2750.56] like just exploding when something crazy happens you can't beat that environment yeah and
[2750.56 → 2757.60] there's stuff like one thing that I think led to the hype of that is we often have these halo lands
[2757.60 → 2762.16] usually they didn't bother like hook everything up in the garage and stuff though so it was all
[2762.16 → 2767.28] inside, and usually it was on just one TV, so there's less green peeking, and it wasn't as serious this
[2767.28 → 2771.76] time we had them separated teams were apart your team was figured out way ahead of time if you made
[2771.76 → 2776.16] it to the finals you made it through like multiple other teams so you guys were like working on strategies
[2776.16 → 2782.56] and stuff like it actually got like pretty serious it's really cool I don't know i I deeply miss that
[2782.56 → 2787.12] atmosphere because that's uh not a thing that is as easy to do anymore because everyone just wants to
[2787.12 → 2795.52] stay home I also have another birthday memory that I should probably talk about the first year that
[2795.52 → 2803.20] Yvonne and I were together for my birthday she got me I mean this was the moment when I had to know
[2803.20 → 2809.76] that this was forever I know this one okay she bought me was this year one or year two I can't remember
[2809.76 → 2819.60] exactly which year, but she's clearly my soul mate she went out with me, and she either did I pay for
[2819.60 → 2824.80] did she pay for it is didn't matter the point was we went out and got me for my birthday an air
[2824.80 → 2831.28] conditioner a window mounted air conditioning unit the one I thought it was this was my birthday and I'd
[2831.28 → 2839.28] have to check the year, but she went out oh, oh a window mounted air conditioner okay helped me tear it down
[2840.00 → 2846.24] and helped me get started building my chiller which was my subzero cooler for my I guess it would have
[2846.24 → 2853.76] been in an option 165 back then or something like that it was either that or e6600 era I can't remember
[2853.76 → 2861.52] the point is any woman who will do that for you is you gotta hold on to that this must have
[2861.52 → 2866.48] been later this yeah it being later makes complete sense but i I thought you're talking about the case
[2866.48 → 2873.52] uh tj07 was either was b was after must have been after yeah I can't, I can't remember the timelines
[2873.52 → 2881.52] make more sense for it to be after I think did I work at NCI yet at that time maybe not no I think
[2881.52 → 2887.44] chillers first I think tj07 is later because that's when I was with it at NCI so I think TJ uh tj07 might
[2887.44 → 2895.04] be like year two or three and the hd555s are very early on, but that's NCI so hd555s might have been
[2895.04 → 2901.52] year two tj07 year three and then I mean can you tell that this lady like takes care of me man
[2902.72 → 2907.36] so yeah it's pretty cool built put putting together and I mean more took it apart than put it together
[2907.36 → 2914.64] but my first sub-zero CPU cooler uh was definitely a super memorable
[2914.64 → 2920.88] birthday for me that's sweet uh I don't have a ton of time left should we finish topics or should we do
[2920.88 → 2926.32] more merch messages oh i I okay bell do you want to just uh why don't I do a quick topic, and you can go
[2926.32 → 2930.56] through and see if there's anything that's uh directed at Luke so we can make sure we get to that
[2930.56 → 2938.96] right away Elon Musk has put the twitter deal on hold over fake account details this morning musk
[2938.96 → 2945.44] tweeted Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam fake
[2945.44 → 2951.36] accounts do indeed represent less than five percent of users he linked a Reuters article describing a
[2951.36 → 2958.24] twitter filing which estimated that fake spam accounts represented fewer than five percent of
[2958.24 → 2965.04] the platform's monetizable daily active users during q1 of 2022, and we've we've sort of talked
[2965.04 → 2969.68] about this on the show this came up a few weeks back where I mentioned or one of us mentioned
[2969.68 → 2976.16] who knows um that it had very recently like right before the acquisition announcement come out
[2976.16 → 2980.48] because of all this stuff that was going on that they had a lot more fake users than they thought
[2981.44 → 2987.20] so Elon replied to his own tweet with still committed to the acquisition
[2987.20 → 2993.12] um, but analysts are speculating that musk could be seeking to renegotiate the price or even walk away
[2993.12 → 2999.04] from the takeover I mean if I was him I'd be walking away from the takeover I saw I didn't look
[2999.04 → 3005.76] blessings at the same time I did not verify the numbers um but I saw a hilarious tweet that was
[3005.76 → 3013.76] basically like cost to start tesla one and a half billion cost to start SpaceX the two billion cost to take
[3013.76 → 3021.76] over stupid social media platform 44 billion it's really not looking like his best move right now
[3021.76 → 3026.96] yeah twitter's share price which was already selling for less than the 54.20 per share that musk offered
[3026.96 → 3033.60] plunged 10 Friday morning following the tweets and this is only the latest instance of musk causing wild
[3033.60 → 3041.28] shifts in share prices with tweets um now this is a random thought just sort of unrelated to willy Monty
[3041.28 → 3050.88] seeing the positive response to Elon's commitment to authenticate all humans on Twitter yeah I mean
[3050.88 → 3056.48] have you noticed how positive the internet has been around that like as an effort to reduce spam reduce
[3056.48 → 3063.68] bots but are you not reminded of the time google tried to do this with Google plus and how angry everyone
[3063.68 → 3068.56] was about it, they tried to do it with Google plus they tried to do it with YouTube Facebook tried to do it
[3068.56 → 3075.28] it and every single time people are mad but now all of a sudden Elon Musk wants to do it and I feel
[3075.28 → 3080.48] like the backlash is way less I do think twitter is a little different this is one time when
[3080.48 → 3085.76] I'll, I'll kind of side with the twitter side of things where I usually go on the other side I do
[3085.76 → 3091.12] think twitter is a little different i I think the standard approach for most people on Twitter is to
[3091.12 → 3099.12] to go with a very personalized public profile with their name or whatever else um, and you can be
[3099.12 → 3104.00] authenticated on Twitter without your name being there I believe the Google plus stuff like when they
[3104.00 → 3108.40] did it to YouTube comments it became your name your full name yes yeah so that's I don't think that's
[3108.40 → 3115.20] going to be a thing on Twitter um but what's the point of a verification process if it doesn't verify
[3115.84 → 3120.64] your name I don't think it's verifying your name though yeah, but you're still it's verifying that
[3120.64 → 3125.12] this is an official account for whatever it represents I see so like the Linus tech tips account
[3125.12 → 3130.64] wouldn't have to become like Linus Sebastian yeah corporate yeah Twitter account it would be able to
[3130.64 → 3137.76] stay Linus tech tips sure okay so if you were representing a bit google plus allowed like
[3137.76 → 3146.96] entity accounts as well did it yeah it did okay so I don't know I think this might be one of those
[3146.96 → 3152.88] things where a lot of people are in an anything but what we have mentality because verification right
[3152.88 → 3157.12] now is just fundamentally broken I mean is it just is it one of those things where they just hadn't
[3157.12 → 3163.44] spent enough time on YouTube to understand that verified human users on YouTube was a positive thing I mean
[3163.44 → 3169.60] think about where we'd be today with YouTube platform spam if we had all just submitted to our
[3169.60 → 3176.56] google overlords 10 years ago I don't I look I'm not I'm saying I don't be less spam I don't okay sure
[3176.56 → 3182.48] I'm not saying submitting to our Google overlords is a good idea argument because they have done such a
[3182.48 → 3189.20] bad job of it when we know that like they could be doing community projects from like in the oh Joe yeah yeah
[3189.20 → 3195.36] are incredibly outperforming this like billion-dollar company's efforts like no laugh they just
[3195.36 → 3200.16] don't care and have put no work into it and could solve the problem but aren't they were busy removing
[3200.16 → 3205.76] dislikes and I don't think that we need to like to give up our whatever in order for anything we should
[3205.76 → 3212.00] have to give up anything for them to accomplish this like just how is it even possible that every
[3212.00 → 3219.52] permutation of the word WhatsApp cannot just be with one button removed from your comment section
[3219.52 → 3228.24] i I read scams work I've had not one but two people in the last week alone or maybe two weeks but
[3228.24 → 3235.92] either tweet at me or dm me saying hey what happened to that GPU I won or like uh someone was salty about
[3235.92 → 3244.08] like me and shroud ripping them off and I was like this literally never happened yeah yeah yeah i
[3244.08 → 3248.48] there was an I was looking through the comments of the last wan show and there was a few that I expanded
[3248.48 → 3253.60] because there was a reply and I'm like oh I wonder what people think about this comment and almost every
[3253.60 → 3260.48] time it was one reply, and it was just a bot yep with like the thing that I never understand
[3260.48 → 3267.28] is why someone would think if they're like copy the URL that is my profile name or whatever and then
[3267.28 → 3274.80] it's just like totally broken up like that is literally never legit and that would be the weirdest
[3274.80 → 3280.72] way to do that, but we aren't going to shame those people oh that's fair because it's better to talk about
[3280.72 → 3290.40] it and educate no that's true okay yeah I'm on board wow hold on a second what
[3290.40 → 3297.36] i I think you were the hot take and I was the level-headed one we did it we came full circle
[3299.60 → 3301.52] i I'm having a moment here
[3306.56 → 3312.48] but yeah I don't know it's its rampant it's its like it is feels like you know when you go to like
[3312.48 → 3316.32] some weird website and there just happens to be a comment section yes you're like I don't know why
[3316.32 → 3320.16] this has a comment section, but it does, and it's just like bots talking to each other yeah
[3320.16 → 3325.04] YouTube comments like actively feels like that it really does it's really awful it's crazy it's
[3325.04 → 3333.44] awful right now yeah um okay bell do you want to hit us yeah just one message before we go into merge
[3333.44 → 3340.64] messages uh the auction so far have raised over eleven thousand dollars so you'll be matching quite a lot
[3340.64 → 3345.52] good, and they're still open and there is a new GPU added as well so make sure to check out the link in
[3345.52 → 3354.24] all the descriptions oh okay so just to recap we're talking about the auction for um uh fundraising
[3354.24 → 3361.84] for supporting Ukraine charity thing Ivan so you might remember Ivan formerly of uh here and NCI so
[3361.84 → 3368.96] we've worked together a couple of times actually um is having donated his extensive GPU collection we're
[3368.96 → 3377.20] going to have that linked in the video description and uh the proceeds are going to help um what was the
[3377.20 → 3384.08] specific organization cred sos children's villages thank you very much bell and then last
[3384.08 → 3390.80] week i impromptu uh committed to matching the total donation amount so once all of those auctions are
[3390.80 → 3397.60] completed and paid for I will match the total amount um and I talked to Ivan about that and that is now
[3397.60 → 3403.28] actually approved which is good because when I say I'm going to do stuff and I don't actually check with
[3403.28 → 3410.00] the controller of the purse strings that's bad, and we're at our limit of like how many items we can
[3410.00 → 3415.92] list this month or something but next month Ivan actually contributed one more special GPU remember
[3415.92 → 3423.28] these I also know where that's from only a handful of these were ever made these are Star Wars editions of
[3423.28 → 3431.92] the NVIDIA titan XP and this is the galactic empire version so we'll be doing one more one after
[3435.20 → 3441.92] awesome uh from Edward what are there any things that you collect as a hobby
[3444.96 → 3451.20] don't really like collect stuff so I like the idea of collecting you know I went to a little video for
[3451.20 → 3456.32] the first time this week it's kind of cool I had never been there before it's kind of amazing yeah
[3456.32 → 3463.20] I actually like really like that I picked up some 3d Blu-rays we did a video on uh 3d TVs this week
[3463.20 → 3472.16] just like uh you know a WTF happened to 3d TVs video we got our hands on the best 3d TV ever made
[3472.16 → 3478.00] the LG signature g6 yeah it sounds like it probably would be what's really cool about it is that every
[3478.00 → 3484.96] 3d Blu-ray is 1080p because 3d 4k never really happened 4k happened after 3d and they just 3d was
[3484.96 → 3492.32] already kind of dead um so this TV is 4k, and it has a polarization film on every other vertical line
[3493.44 → 3500.64] so what it means is you can use passive glasses, so there are no shutters and because the content is 1080p
[3500.64 → 3511.44] but the panel is 4k yeah it can actually show full quality full vertical resolution 1080p images at the
[3511.44 → 3516.80] same time it feels like it might actually not be a trash experience by only one pixel, and it was so
[3517.76 → 3525.04] awesome and I'd forgotten how cool it was done well because shutter glasses suck that I started looking
[3525.04 → 3533.28] into it and um I realized that with this product from HD fury I want to say you can actually play
[3533.28 → 3540.96] back 3d Blu-rays into this splitter that will then split each frame packed alternating frame the right
[3540.96 → 3546.88] and left frame out to two different projectors put polarizing filters on them and I want to do a 3d
[3546.88 → 3551.84] theatre at home do that yeah yeah the reason we went to willow video in the first place was because we
[3551.84 → 3561.04] didn't have any good 3d content we had titanic which was early awful 2d to 3d conversion sounds
[3561.04 → 3565.60] about right it was just headache inducing right, and we wanted some animated films so we were like where
[3565.60 → 3573.20] are we going to go willow video they had a great selection they had almost the entire MCU in 3d I was
[3573.20 → 3578.32] so close to buying it I settled on just some animated films because they tend to translate best yeah and it
[3578.32 → 3583.92] just it got me kind of jazzed and excited because it's going to be a really fun project anyway so i
[3583.92 → 3587.68] don't remember where I'm going with this story anymore but I went to willow video it's as amazing
[3587.68 → 3593.44] as you said right I like the idea of collecting so I saw all the marvel movies in 3d and I was like i
[3593.44 → 3600.16] should collect these and I picked them all up and I went I don't need these I put them down and that's
[3600.16 → 3607.12] always my thing I have a copy of Super Mario RPG for SNES because Anthony was at willow video and
[3607.12 → 3612.00] texted me and was like hey it's actually a pretty good price for a CIA I know you've wanted one of
[3612.00 → 3620.72] these for a long time do you want it and I was like impulse buy yes um i probably just put a shelf
[3620.72 → 3625.44] somewhere I'm not going to buy another one yeah you know I like I'm not gonna oh I really want to copy
[3625.44 → 3633.68] Final Fantasy 3. but anyway I'm not six but three because it's NASS in North America um so i just I don't
[3633.68 → 3638.48] know i just I have trouble with it like i just I like the idea of it and I'm like this is cool and
[3638.48 → 3644.80] like when people have cool collections I'm like wow that's so cool but i just i I don't get it I don't
[3644.80 → 3653.20] derive any joy from just like looking at my stuff I guess yeah it's tough I personally appreciate more
[3653.20 → 3660.56] like uh mementos or reminders of like things that I have done or been a part of or whatever
[3661.12 → 3667.36] those have more meaning to me than purchase collectibles sure yeah so i still have
[3667.36 → 3672.16] a bunch of like I have a lot of the passes from shows that we've gone to I have like little things
[3672.16 → 3677.20] from stuff that I've either done personally or professionally from like pretty much my whole life
[3677.20 → 3682.16] and I like those things I don't want to get rid of those yeah i have like a memento box and
[3682.16 → 3686.48] I actually have a place at the new house that I'm going to put them so I have a shelf behind where
[3686.48 → 3691.12] I'm going to be streaming that's got RGB illumination on each shelf, and so I'll be able to put like all
[3691.12 → 3699.36] my stuff there that's pretty cool uh don't well we'll look at that later from Joshua love the pc
[3699.36 → 3704.80] build guide last one you'll ever need are there any other ideas or plans for other long form build guides
[3704.80 → 3716.00] nope absolutely not that took like four months and the good news is that it is completely rocket
[3716.00 → 3723.68] shipping for us now it started out kind of slow which was really, really discouraging and is now at
[3723.68 → 3732.64] the point where it's its broken free from gravity's pull and is headed straight to orbit
[3732.64 → 3739.60] so I'm I'm really happy with how it turned out but the thing you guys got to understand is that content
[3739.60 → 3745.28] like that is not sustainable on the platform so like look at this okay here's the here's the raw numbers
[3745.28 → 3752.64] okay 2.8 million views so you can see this really broke through what our typical view range is which is
[3752.64 → 3758.48] this this this gray band here it did drive some new subscribers not nearly as much as we'd like to
[3758.48 → 3765.52] see with content like that uh you want i I would want to see this double with this kind of view count
[3765.52 → 3772.64] but we've really struggled to drive new subscribers lately I'm not sure exactly why compared to our peaks
[3772.64 → 3777.60] we're like one sixth of our daily rate or something like that right now even though all the new content
[3777.60 → 3784.32] is generating net new subscribers this watch time this is monstrous and that's why you're seeing these
[3784.32 → 3789.92] crazy revenue numbers on it but even with these revenue numbers even with the sea sonic dedicated
[3789.92 → 3797.76] sponsorship this was such a colossally expensive video to produce that while we did come out okay on
[3797.76 → 3804.32] this one I would not be looking to make a bet like that again and no that wasn't in a month when did it
[3804.32 → 3812.00] come out did it come out in a month I'm not sure yeah in a month um people are like 11k in a month nice
[3812.00 → 3821.20] okay, okay yes, yes that's really nice, but it was really expensive to make that's not net that's gross
[3822.08 → 3823.52] so you got to be careful with that
[3826.88 → 3833.44] from William my son loves the ABCs of gaming book and plushier so much and the photos are very cute
[3834.32 → 3842.24] oh this is so cute they actually included them in their son's uh six months uh photo shoot that is
[3842.24 → 3848.56] cool adorable I love it thank you for sharing that with me any dad tips for someone new to fatherhood
[3850.00 → 3855.68] I mean other than just try really hard all the time and by the time they get to about six months be aware
[3855.68 → 3860.96] that they're playing you okay you have to understand just because they can't talk just because they don't
[3860.96 → 3866.96] speak English or whatever language you speak um that doesn't mean that they are not Homo sapiens
[3867.92 → 3875.92] they are smart okay, and they are basically playing you from the moment they can like to make eye contact
[3875.92 → 3881.60] to the moment that you kick them out of your house um probably still after that yeah probably
[3881.60 → 3885.76] probably still after that and I don't mean that in like a bad way I just mean you have to your have to
[3885.76 → 3892.72] respect them you have to understand that these are highly, highly intelligent creatures, and you have to
[3892.72 → 3898.32] be consistent right because they will look for every gap in your armour, and they will exploit it
[3898.32 → 3903.44] and most importantly they will look for the gaps between you and you're so assuming that you're raising
[3903.44 → 3909.76] the child with and so interesting that makes sense that's the big one yeah is they will find those gaps and
[3909.76 → 3919.04] they will exploit them if is is mom always gives into you know video games before dinner and dad always gives
[3919.04 → 3924.32] into uh treats before dinner then they're going to go to mom and ask for video games they're going to go to
[3924.32 → 3929.52] dad and ask for treats and the parents are going to come in they're going to be eating treats playing video games and
[3929.52 → 3934.64] you're going to be like what is going on here they're gonna look for it make sense
[3934.64 → 3941.20] that's hold on that's a one says my dad calls me the gift that keeps on receiving
[3943.12 → 3948.80] I love it that's pretty good the thing that gets me is when we play games with little man
[3950.88 → 3958.00] the speed at which he adapts to things oh yeah their brains are actually wired better than ours
[3958.80 → 3963.68] because like they're not solidified, yet there's experience there's wisdom is and there's whatever else but
[3963.68 → 3970.24] there's also the rate that he's catching up, and it's like mind-blowing oh boy like okay
[3971.84 → 3978.40] yeah it's uh it's a little spooky from Micah what are your guy's first big tech purchase do you still
[3978.40 → 3988.16] have it today or do you have immediate buyer's remorse mineral pc don't have it today no buyer's remorse
[3988.16 → 3995.20] yeah my first big one would have been my first I didn't pay for my disk man I don't think I don't
[3995.20 → 4000.00] know if you can tell like call like a fish tank and some oil tech purchase because I already had all the
[4000.00 → 4004.40] computer components but whatever I'm counting it yeah my first gaming computer I don't have it but I did
[4004.40 → 4010.00] do a build like replicating it a little while ago that was cool I did do a video about it yeah i I wouldn't
[4010.00 → 4017.20] have any use for it today kind of you know sucks that's the thing about tech I wish I still had my SNES
[4017.20 → 4022.24] that wasn't a purchase I lost that when I moved that was a gift though I wish I still had it but I don't
[4022.88 → 4024.32] so no, no I guess it's all gone
[4026.48 → 4031.44] from Ryan I'm preparing to make a change from a standalone headset to a deck amp and headphone combo
[4031.44 → 4037.52] do you have any recommendations on brands or models for a first timer nope go talk to people
[4037.52 → 4043.84] who specialize in that or come back in like a year we've we've got someone hired already who's working
[4043.84 → 4048.56] away on our test suite for the lab on all of that stuff, but we're not ready to publish anything so
[4049.76 → 4054.56] I'm out I'm out uh we should do should we do one more time oh wait you have to go now right let's do
[4055.52 → 4059.84] are you out i I have a little bit more time I can fire through one more topic than I have to go
[4059.84 → 4063.52] okay or some merch messages, and then we should pick something we should pick something cool is
[4063.52 → 4067.52] there anything specifically for Luke I don't think there was
[4070.16 → 4076.40] bye bye iPod sure did you ever have an iPod no me neither my brother did I feel like I missed out
[4077.04 → 4085.68] I don't oh okay well that's a controversial take um yeah maybe i uh I don't know when they first came
[4085.68 → 4092.08] out they were really expensive oh yeah like especially for the stage in life that I was at
[4092.08 → 4099.68] like there was no way I think I was like first year university or so when iPods really started
[4099.68 → 4105.28] popping off so that would have been 2005 because when did they come out oh no, no they must have been
[4105.28 → 4110.56] earlier than that when did the first iPod come out it was later than that, or maybe it was later than
[4110.56 → 4116.40] 2001 okay so it was significantly later than that the first person at my nobody at my school had
[4116.40 → 4121.12] that so that's what yeah I think the first person at my school to get one was probably closer to like
[4121.12 → 4130.64] 2006. Like there was one guy with a mini disc player everyone else was still on discmans yeah
[4131.36 → 4138.80] I don't think I had a dismin either it just it seemed especially when the iPod was like when people
[4138.80 → 4144.48] cared about it, you know a lot i I just kept looking at it being like there's no I don't have a phone
[4144.48 → 4151.44] yet like I'm not going to buy this portable music player um especially when like a lot of the I don't
[4151.44 → 4154.72] know a lot of the physical activity that I did at that time would have been while I was wearing
[4154.72 → 4162.24] helmets like I'm not it's not gonna 400 us dollars at that time with a five gigabyte hard drive yeah like
[4162.24 → 4169.04] there's no way in 2001. It was a hard drive and I remember back then thinking that's really stupid
[4169.04 → 4177.68] I don't want that so my first mp3 player was in high school I must have been in grade 10. I was either
[4177.68 → 4186.88] in grade 10 or 11, and it was a RCA lira cool uh I got the 64 gig version because I could not afford
[4186.88 → 4193.36] the 128 gig version it just was not worth the extra money, and it looked a little something like this
[4194.88 → 4202.24] this yeah okay right here it held under an album worth of songs at like reasonable quality you could
[4202.24 → 4211.04] put a whole album on if you were willing to really uh pick the quality a little bit but that served my
[4211.04 → 4218.56] purposes once I was ready to retire my disc man and I don't really have any regrets about that i
[4218.56 → 4224.00] I was I I was and actually still am the kind of person that only really listens to a handful of songs
[4224.00 → 4230.24] at a time so the way I handle it now is I just add things to my likes the automatic playlist in YouTube
[4230.24 → 4235.60] music i just I'll like things and then whenever I start I want to listen to music I'll just start playing that
[4235.60 → 4240.88] playlist and by the time it makes it through the stuff I've ratted the stuff I've added
[4240.88 → 4247.04] recently that I am enjoying listening to right now then I'll probably be done driving wherever it is
[4247.04 → 4252.08] I'm driving or cleaning up whatever room it is I'm cleaning up and I'm ready to move on like I don't
[4252.08 → 4258.00] I remember thinking at the time how could I possibly have a thousand songs that I need to have at my
[4258.00 → 4263.68] fingertips and then now we've come so far from from from there's hundreds of thousands of songs at
[4263.68 → 4270.72] your fingertips at some point in time I had a creative zen never I never did what did I use
[4270.72 → 4278.40] then I had my lira but the creative zen that I got I specifically remember it was like 30 bucks
[4278.40 → 4284.56] like it was very out of date when I bought it, it was like yeah I listened to a lot of radio
[4284.56 → 4290.56] back then me too yeah huh I didn't even really think about that yeah no I just didn't really have
[4290.56 → 4296.64] a mp3 player until I got an iphone 4. yep
[4300.96 → 4307.44] if I remember I would sit at my computer wow I didn't even think about this yeah I would sit at my
[4307.44 → 4313.92] computer and listen to my Napster downloaded mp3s and then if you were out I had CDs too
[4313.92 → 4321.92] no I had a CD player in my room I had uh my I got my brothers why did no I ripped them okay I'm
[4321.92 → 4324.88] confused oh I think my brother went away to university and maybe that's why I got it i
[4324.88 → 4331.36] don't remember yeah he had like a boom box oh yeah yeah me too so I got his of that but I never had my
[4331.36 → 4335.28] own i just that's crazy yeah I'm like thinking back to that summer I painted my parents house like
[4335.28 → 4343.52] yeah I was listening to hybrid theory on a boom box yeah yeah huh that's probably it for me, i have to bounce
[4343.52 → 4348.48] here all right see you later okay uh oh I guess I didn't really like talk about the topic so 20
[4348.48 → 4354.24] years of production apple ended one of its most iconic nameplates the iPod only in the subtitle
[4354.24 → 4357.84] do they mention that the iPod touch will be available while supplies last it is apparently
[4357.84 → 4362.00] already sold out they talked about the spirit of the iPod and how it lives on in Apple Music
[4362.00 → 4366.88] integration across the current products from iPhone to HomePod mini and Apple Music and here are some
[4366.88 → 4373.44] iPod facts for you thank your thanks to Jonathan horst the first iPod came out on October 23rd 2001
[4373.44 → 4379.20] as a minor launch it had a mechanical click wheel five gigs of storage a full-size FireWire port and
[4379.20 → 4387.84] cost this says only truly an apple perspective cost only 399 us dollars the iPod burst in popularity
[4387.84 → 4395.92] after apple released iTunes for windows glass of water in hell oh okay yep and the iPod mini at 249
[4395.92 → 4401.60] reaching a much wider audience yeah that was the other issue was the early non-hard drive based iPods
[4401.60 → 4406.48] just felt not sensible in terms of how much storage I could put on and how much storage they had for
[4406.48 → 4412.72] the price at a later stage of my life where I had a much larger music library yeah, and it mentions here
[4412.72 → 4417.20] that it peaked in popularity around 2008 that lines up because I was thinking like yeah it was like 2006
[4417.20 → 4423.28] 2007 when I saw the first one in my school yeah so I don't know the last click wheel iPod classic was
[4423.28 → 4432.88] discontinued in 2014 that recently that's interesting if you're interested in iPod contact uh content
[4432.88 → 4438.56] check out dank pots or garbage time on flow plane let's go anyway that's it all right see you later
[4438.56 → 4444.56] Luke I'm still going to stick around and do a few merch messages here because uh people are apparently eating
[4444.56 → 4449.92] up those stealth pants as well as the screwdriver shirt so I definitely got some more stuff to talk about
[4449.92 → 4459.12] oh crap um I think Yvonne took my car and Luke was going to be my ride today so that's pretty funny
[4459.12 → 4460.48] I guess I will Uber home
[4463.20 → 4469.68] now we know you can pay me to drive you home fantastic hours right uh i i I don't actually
[4469.68 → 4474.56] know how that works to be perfectly honest with you because it's not really your job all right what are we
[4474.56 → 4481.28] doing now well from we have a question from tatting how do you feel the opening of lab 2 and testing
[4481.28 → 4486.88] will affect sponsors and ads do you feel like that will create a conflict of interest the way that I see
[4486.88 → 4498.00] it is the harder we go with labs and the more we lean into empirical data the more precious a sponsorship
[4498.00 → 4504.24] on LTT is going to become because as soon as you start rejecting more of your sponsors you can
[4504.24 → 4509.20] increase the rates for the ones that remain because like I've I've talked about so many times in the
[4509.20 → 4514.72] past it all comes down to our most valuable commodity which is the trust that we maintain with our viewers
[4514.72 → 4521.36] so yeah we're probably going to lose some sponsors I mean stuff happens right you call out someone who
[4521.36 → 4527.68] previously sponsored you I think a perfect example would be someone like an NVIDIA and someone gets
[4527.68 → 4534.24] salty, and they don't work with you anymore, and it's like okay and eventually that person will move on
[4534.72 → 4538.80] um at NVIDIA I have a pretty good idea who it is I think they're pretty high up, and it's not going to
[4538.80 → 4546.24] happen anytime soon it's fine I can wait I'm younger than them um, and it's just going to be a cycle
[4546.24 → 4552.56] right because the thing people I think a lot of people miss is that companies are made up of people
[4553.12 → 4561.76] and so people come and people go and people have different approaches, and we used to be a lot more
[4562.72 → 4568.24] uh conservative I think in our in the way that we engaged with companies like we used to worry more
[4568.24 → 4573.60] about what they thought and nowadays, the way that we see it we just need to do whatever is right for our
[4573.60 → 4579.12] viewers and the companies that understand that and respect that are going to engage with us and
[4579.12 → 4584.08] they're going to get access to that that relationship we built with our viewers and the ones that don't
[4584.08 → 4589.20] understand that and want to try and play games are not going to get access, and it's really just that simple
[4591.44 → 4596.64] from Mani what are your thoughts on the ever-increasing power consumption of top-end GPUs
[4596.64 → 4601.36] especially with the rumors of the 4090 drawing up to 600 watts or more
[4603.76 → 4611.76] i feel like I'm I feel like I'm painting myself into a corner here uh what I want to say
[4611.76 → 4618.80] is we're reaching a practical limit and I feel like this is one of those situations where it's like
[4619.52 → 4624.88] you know you can go back, and six seven eight years ago there are clips of me on wans ho saying yeah crypto
[4624.88 → 4631.28] you're never going to be able to buy anything real with bitcoin right like I'm 64 kilobytes of ram
[4631.28 → 4640.40] ought to be enough for anyone or whatever that that misattributed quote is um it's possible I'd like
[4640.40 → 4647.20] to think that we're only really going to see that in crazy like gigantic multi-die data centre products
[4647.20 → 4657.36] but I don't know I don't know man there 's's this never-ending appetite for higher and higher
[4657.36 → 4664.40] performance gaming solutions right and display resolutions we're all we can already buy a
[4664.40 → 4673.36] display today right that cannot be driven by any modern GPU and probably not comfortably driven
[4673.36 → 4679.92] by the next generation of GPUs we have new interfaces coming DisplayPort 2.0 is right around the corner that
[4679.92 → 4686.72] are going to be able to drive those kinds of resolutions at high refresh rates we are
[4686.72 → 4694.64] three four generations of product away from being able to play a triple a game today at 8k 120 fps
[4695.36 → 4702.32] so with that in mind i I don't think it's impossible that we will keep seeing companies chasing these higher
[4702.32 → 4710.16] and higher and higher and higher total graphics power consumption numbers i I'd like to say we're capped
[4710.16 → 4721.12] out but nothing's impossible I mean intel okay intel you want to find a more conservative you want like okay
[4723.28 → 4728.24] I wanted to say something along the lines of you won't find a more conservative blue company but IBM
[4728.24 → 4736.24] I might actually take the cake there but intel hyper conservative, and yet they released that
[4736.24 → 4746.24] weird peatier uh cooler that where they partnered with um EK and cooler master right so clearly nothing's
[4746.24 → 4755.20] off the table anymore from emerald coco what's your favourite Saturday morning cartoon growing up and how much do you miss it
[4758.24 → 4762.88] Saturday morning cartoons man there were a lot of Looney Tunes reruns when I was a kid
[4763.76 → 4772.32] favourite though I love the theme song of the Casper the friendly ghost show but it almost always it was
[4772.32 → 4779.44] like it was one of those variety ones like um oh what's the one i I don't remember, but there were
[4779.44 → 4785.60] a handful of ones where it was like sketches, and you know i almost never got to see the characters
[4785.60 → 4791.68] that I liked from the intro so Saturday morning cartoons man I don't even remember I was never an
[4791.68 → 4798.00] ani maniacs kid I can tell you that much not into that hopefully chat can help me out here a little
[4798.00 → 4809.60] bit uh yeah DuckTales was awesome still like ducktales is amazing show dexter's lab yeah dexter's lab
[4809.60 → 4816.88] I don't enjoy that much uh I don't enjoy anymore as an adult but I did like it when I was a kid
[4818.88 → 4824.24] didn't watch Doug didn't get into sonic the hedgehog reboot was okay you know maybe I just didn't watch
[4824.24 → 4828.72] Saturday morning cartoons that much samurai pizza cats was one of those shows I just didn't really
[4828.72 → 4835.28] understand I just didn't really get it i I've always had that experience when I try to watch anime style shows
[4835.28 → 4841.92] i i I've been told there are some ones that as an adult I might really enjoy teenage mutant ninja
[4841.92 → 4845.84] turtles yeah like I saw a handful of episodes I'm trying to think I don't think we had cable at
[4845.84 → 4851.84] either of my parents houses at that point in my life so that definitely put a damper on how much
[4851.84 → 4856.64] Saturday morning cartoons I could watch but I had video games right I had my SNES at my dad's house
[4856.64 → 4865.36] yeah shout out reboot Canadian show so good I remember the animation being a lot better than it
[4865.36 → 4873.52] was um it's rough yeah I had a look at it recently I was like whoa it's pretty bad um from Dakota and
[4873.52 → 4878.48] quite a few different people uh any updated thoughts on the steam deck with their continued updates like 40
[4878.48 → 4886.48] hertz uh as well as they are going so hard I'm so impressed with valve's apparent
[4886.48 → 4892.32] commitment to the steam deck they were clearly not done out of the gate, and it's everything from
[4892.32 → 4899.52] performance improvements to fan profile improvements to quality of life improvements and i have to say at
[4899.52 → 4905.84] the rate that they're going right now my original review like the steam deck is going to be unrecognizable
[4906.72 → 4912.16] in a year compared to what you guys saw and that's without them changing any of the hardware so I'm
[4913.12 → 4921.20] all i have to say is kudos valve I want to see more, but you're doing a great job keep it up from Noah do
[4921.20 → 4926.24] you think it's possible that desktop OS systems could eventually replace android and iOS with this move to
[4926.24 → 4934.08] desktop processors being the same as what's in mobile processors' no i I don't foresee that and I think
[4934.08 → 4940.88] it's more likely that we're going to see like we've seen on macOS I think it's more likely that we're going
[4940.88 → 4947.84] to see mobile first architectures make their way into desktop applications or I mean they're all they've
[4947.84 → 4958.64] already made huge inroads in the enterprise x86 I don't know was very reliant on Moore's law was reliant
[4958.64 → 4962.96] on the transistors just shrinking so that the chips would just get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper so
[4962.96 → 4968.96] they could maintain all that legacy as they added new features and added more performance whereas
[4969.52 → 4973.92] whether you want to talk arm or you want to talk risk five they don't have that baggage and I think
[4973.92 → 4979.52] that if we're talking in the long term we're talking 10 20 30 years it's its just going to be really
[4979.52 → 4989.12] tough from justice I'm running a 3080 and an i9 9900k looking at the numbers I'm thinking about going to
[4989.12 → 4993.92] 12th gen do you think the performance would be noticeable the performance increase will be noticeable
[4993.92 → 4998.64] but whether it will be noticeable in a way that actually makes you a better gamer for example is
[4998.64 → 5006.96] an entirely different ball of wax I mean the cool thing about tools like um NVIDIA's frame view for
[5006.96 → 5013.04] example or even just the fps counter that they have in their uh in their GeForce experience dashboard is
[5013.04 → 5023.04] that everyone has access to benchmarking tools for free included with their GPU that were maybe
[5023.04 → 5027.60] broadly available in the form of something like fraps back in the day but not necessarily
[5027.60 → 5032.56] as easy to use or as intuitive because you had to actually go install a separate third-party
[5032.56 → 5037.44] application so what you should do is you should have a look at the games you play at the resolution that
[5037.44 → 5043.36] you play at the details that you want to see and figure it out do you are you actually do
[5043.36 → 5051.28] you actually need more performance and if you do should you be waiting for the upcoming rdna3 and uh
[5051.28 → 5056.96] RTX whatever it ends up being called maybe 40 series that's supposed to be coming sometime this year
[5056.96 → 5062.72] maybe you have an unlimited budget maybe you could afford to do both but given that you're asking if it's
[5062.72 → 5068.32] worth it I would say that you do not oh you have a g9 neo oh good gravy I'd say you're going to be
[5068.32 → 5075.36] more GPU limited you should uh wait for a GPU 9900k is still a darn fast chip
[5077.60 → 5084.00] from Benjamin I love the idea of a tech link for gaming do you have any ideas on what content you can
[5084.00 → 5089.60] imagine that show covering oh yeah I mean I could see us covering game development news I could see us doing
[5089.60 → 5097.20] a lot more coverage of things like consoles uh it's something that we touch on tech linked
[5097.20 → 5103.52] but tech link can never really afford to be a deeper dive into really any vertical so if we were
[5103.52 → 5109.84] to do something like a gaming focused version of a tech link like show I think it would just be it
[5109.84 → 5115.20] would be more depth I'd love to see us cover things like speed running news right that stuff that just
[5115.20 → 5120.72] does not make the grade for tech linked because it doesn't have that mainstream appeal
[5120.72 → 5126.96] but it is something that even if uh a gaming version of tech linked is only going to get half the
[5127.60 → 5132.72] viewership per episode of tech linked I think it could still be very sustainable, and we could
[5132.72 → 5138.64] shine more light on the events and in those kinds of communities, or you know talk about things like
[5138.64 → 5145.20] um there's been there's been a lot of discussion around things like burnout in the game games
[5145.20 → 5148.96] uh development industry these are things that I think we'd like to cover more
[5151.28 → 5158.08] from thank you hi Linus long time fan hi thank you I currently own two hp reliant server racks outfitted with
[5158.08 → 5161.92] multiple servers I'm in the process of moving and wonder if you have any advice on how to move
[5161.92 → 5168.08] my servers and hard drives your hard drives should be boxed up in foam boxes like they were shipped in
[5168.56 → 5173.36] and then they should be ideally hand carried you really want to reduce vibration the last thing
[5173.36 → 5178.08] you want to do is put them on a cart with hard wheels and roll them across a parking lot because
[5178.08 → 5185.92] there's a whole story there it's bad vibration is a hard drive killer um other than making sure that
[5185.92 → 5193.76] they're well padded uh I can tell you that one thing I would like to do if I was you is had a copy of
[5193.76 → 5201.12] the data that is not in transit on these hard drives I don't know how doable that will be for
[5201.12 → 5208.00] you, but that's that's the safest way and then when I get to the other side I would like to run tests i
[5208.00 → 5211.92] would like to run it with the very least smart tests on these drives to validate that they are in fact
[5211.92 → 5218.56] still working before I put my data uh onto them all the data will still be there but before I rely on
[5218.56 → 5225.20] them again from Carlos and quite a few people in chats any updates on the short circuit hoodie that
[5225.20 → 5231.76] you're aware of uh oh I can get you that actually one moment please short circuit
[5233.28 → 5240.40] I just need to check Nick's weekly check-in nick run rate report
[5242.80 → 5248.80] okay so here's the one from the week of May 1st this is from last week short circuit hoodie says
[5248.80 → 5255.76] I believe they are shipping out this week is Nick's update for me on that and Gmail just signed me out
[5255.76 → 5265.76] thank you very much for that but I did get you guys the update awesome from Dylan do you think
[5265.76 → 5273.04] NVIDIA will have a response to the uh gx50 GPUs just released by AMD or are they just going to wait to the 40 series
[5273.04 → 5282.88] I mean they already launched the 3090 ti if NVIDIA were going to respond in any meaningful way I would
[5282.88 → 5287.92] think it might be a price adjustment I don't think we're going to see another product launch honestly
[5291.28 → 5296.24] from carl you mentioned on a previous one show that leg wants to create a wall from fan
[5296.24 → 5301.76] colour GPU waistline postcards any updates have we received any back I haven't received an update on
[5301.76 → 5306.32] that we have definitely received some back so I would strongly encourage you guys to choose the
[5306.32 → 5312.40] GPU wasteland postcard and send it to us, but we have not begun integrating them into a wall I do know
[5312.40 → 5318.24] that nick has some he's shown them to me but I haven't seen I haven't seen any other than like
[5318.24 → 5324.48] the first five or so that were sent over it's going to be super cool from Luther how did you get into
[5324.48 → 5331.36] motorcycling and what's your favourite motorcycle related memory oh my dad had a bike so he would
[5331.36 → 5341.04] take me on the back of it sometimes and that seemed pretty fun and cool and i um I got my I got some
[5341.04 → 5347.04] help to buy my first bike from an old colleague who actually you might know from the roast taken not
[5347.04 → 5354.40] not the taken video editor who uh used to work here but taken my old boss at mix he helped me
[5354.40 → 5360.16] pick out a starter bike and pointed me in the direction of a good course to make sure that I was learning to
[5360.16 → 5365.44] ride safely I guess he didn't want his underling to end up as roadkill any sooner than i absolutely
[5365.44 → 5371.84] had to and uh Von we're just about wrapped apparently Yvonne did not leave without me which is excellent
[5371.84 → 5375.44] because Luke cannot give me a ride today I'm not getting paid hey do you want to come join me
[5377.04 → 5378.08] okay Yvonne's joining me
[5378.08 → 5381.44] she'll be she'll be here soon
[5385.12 → 5385.68] okay cool
[5389.20 → 5396.96] uh yeah so I got to ride on a bike as a kid and then my old boss helped me buy one and i I guess that's i
[5396.96 → 5402.00] guess that's about it what am I joining you for um well the first thing you're going to do is move a
[5402.00 → 5405.36] little closer to the mic these are super, super near field, and you might need to adjust where it
[5405.36 → 5412.64] is because it's for Luke yeah from Connor it has been great to see the LTT team grow over the years
[5412.64 → 5418.64] from personal experience can it be hard to keep a constant vision consistent vision with such a large
[5418.64 → 5422.48] creative team oh yes
[5422.48 → 5432.80] I mean the big one is that early on i I had very direct control over every piece of content like
[5432.80 → 5438.88] I would write or at least oversee pretty much every element of it and then as soon as it got to the
[5438.88 → 5443.20] point where I would be busy filming tomorrow's video while today's was being edited and I couldn't
[5443.20 → 5449.92] even look at the edit until it was pretty much done i I had to concede a bunch of control and
[5449.92 → 5454.16] then it's kind of slipped away and slipped away and slipped away to the point where now instead of
[5454.16 → 5458.48] saying what words instead of dictating what words we're going to say and what we're going to show on
[5458.48 → 5465.12] the screen it's more like here are general guiding principles for what our content should look like
[5465.12 → 5469.20] and then now we've gotten to the point where those general guiding principles come from like our
[5469.20 → 5474.88] executive management team instead of from me and then if I see something that's gone totally off the rails
[5474.88 → 5479.60] then I might step in and call for a course correction well I think it depends which
[5479.60 → 5482.24] department you're talking about though because if you're talking about the writing department for
[5482.24 → 5487.36] LTT you're still like the content manager you're scheduling and planning that content yes other
[5487.36 → 5491.04] people are bringing ideas you're also still reviewing every single script no not every script
[5491.04 → 5495.52] not anymore no for example I hosted a video moments before this wan show that was
[5496.16 → 5502.72] i I worked on the skeleton with Alex so I did kind of lay out what the structure of the video was
[5502.72 → 5509.36] what I envisioned that it was going to be but Alex wrote it Anthony reviewed it and I showed up and it
[5509.36 → 5513.68] was on the prompter and now obviously I'm not going to read something that I don't agree with
[5513.68 → 5517.20] I think that's something that's a more recent change though I mean that is something we're trying to
[5517.20 → 5522.00] transition to is not having you on everything but I think it depends on the department for sure
[5524.08 → 5529.68] from Cory love you guys can't wait to get shirts and stickers do you have any favourite TV or streaming
[5529.68 → 5536.72] shows right now oh man are you gonna are they asking you are they asking me I don't know oh
[5536.72 → 5543.04] they're asking love you want to hear from you um I cannot watch TV because I get hooked like
[5543.04 → 5547.68] addicted and then I do nothing but binge-watch the entire season so I'm not allowed TV or books
[5547.68 → 5558.72] uh for me, i really I am the same way it's really hard for me to pick up a new show because as soon as
[5558.72 → 5566.32] I do I got anytime someone tells me this is a perfect show I will make a mental note to never watch it
[5567.20 → 5574.72] because if I do, it's going to be a big problem i i I have been my go-to sleep show has been Bob's
[5574.72 → 5582.40] burgers reruns lately so I guess I like that but i yeah I'm not into anything right now I think we're
[5582.40 → 5588.56] both more into movies because the time commit is very set in stone um yeah for Linus he'll watch
[5588.56 → 5592.80] at one speed and I'll watch at one and a half speed just to be more efficient about it, I like to be
[5592.80 → 5601.28] efficient about wasting my time she'll also be like working on uh like a sticker design for
[5601.28 → 5606.00] on the cricket for the kids walls or whatever at the same time as she's watching a movie whereas i
[5606.00 → 5610.00] tend to watch a movie to turn my brain off so i I don't really want to be doing anything at the same
[5610.00 → 5616.32] time I'll fold laundry and watch something, but that's that's about the most brain consuming
[5616.32 → 5622.64] thing that I can do while I'm also trying to enjoy a movie or a TV show that's it that's all the messages
[5622.64 → 5628.08] everything else is just people saying hi to Yvonne and that they love Yvonne hi oh she's hosting a short
[5628.08 → 5632.72] circuit soon yeah I am it was my first one I was really nervous, so hopefully everyone likes it
[5633.76 → 5637.60] are you going to give them any more details about it or is that it um well it's on the crickets uh
[5637.60 → 5641.28] it's something that I've been using for a little while now I just upgraded myself I treated myself
[5641.28 → 5646.24] to like their top tier model um and then I made yeah I made some stickers and I made something for
[5646.24 → 5650.48] Riley which you guys are going to have to check out and yeah I guess that's I don't know I don't
[5650.48 → 5658.00] want to get too much into it because I want them to watch it uh oh there was something here oh i
[5658.00 → 5664.08] missed it uh it was in float plane chat there was something I was going to respond to but I guess it's
[5665.12 → 5671.92] gone all right well oh uh oleic said that's why he hasn't seen the Mandalorian I actually did watch
[5671.92 → 5678.16] the first season of the Mandalorian it was just not very good sorry um did you end up watching it no i
[5678.16 → 5684.32] didn't okay Ivan's not that into Star Wars in the first place and bad Star Wars is not any better i
[5684.32 → 5690.96] was into what was it called it's not it's the ones that came later the prequels but not really
[5690.96 → 5696.24] because they came later I liked those and then I got crap for liking them, but the story was better
[5697.28 → 5704.64] there was more like character development I guess I mean were they good characters I didn't say they
[5704.64 → 5709.20] were I just said that was it skilful character development more interesting there was more
[5709.20 → 5716.48] going on okay yeah anyway all right well we've wrapped up the rest of our merch messages so I think
[5716.48 → 5730.32] it's time to head home bye thanks for watching good night you all
