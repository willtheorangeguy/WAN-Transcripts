[0.00 → 3.90] Welcome to the WAN Show, where we're going to be coming at you guys with all the hot takes.
[4.16 → 8.98] Just kidding. No hot takes today because all of our news is extremely straightforward,
[9.62 → 13.76] starting with, of course, that Elon Gate continues.
[14.50 → 19.36] That's right. Twitter is threatening to enforce, or rather could enforce,
[19.82 → 24.98] consummation of the agreement for their $44 billion sale.
[24.98 → 31.22] Meanwhile, Elon has formed, or is forming, a hardcore litigation department,
[31.68 → 33.52] or as I call it, the Holder.
[34.48 → 39.92] In other news, Framework, who I have invested in, full disclosure,
[40.40 → 45.92] Framework has joined Intel's 12th generation with a new motherboard
[45.92 → 52.28] and some other really exciting news that is going to be great news for right-to-repair advocates.
[52.50 → 53.44] What else we got today?
[53.44 → 57.08] Uh, this topic that made me frown until I read it,
[57.26 → 59.42] and then it made me give, have a slight chuckle,
[59.68 → 64.02] which is Microsoft patents system to play discs on consoles with no disc drive.
[64.42 → 66.44] Try to figure it out before we get to the topic.
[66.72 → 68.68] I figured it out. It's USB.
[70.06 → 72.82] Whoa! That's crazy!
[73.52 → 75.04] How did anyone get that?
[75.22 → 77.72] We can talk about how stupid that is later, though.
[78.04 → 81.46] And YouTube is highlighting the most replayed parts of videos.
[82.70 → 83.18] Hooray.
[83.44 → 84.02] That's news.
[84.52 → 84.92] Amazing.
[85.18 → 85.54] All right.
[85.62 → 86.08] Well, in other news...
[86.08 → 87.14] I have things to say about it.
[87.16 → 87.66] Here's an intro.
[88.02 → 88.34] Okay.
[92.08 → 93.24] I always die.
[93.24 → 113.88] The show is brought to you by Origin PC, Zoho Desk, and Secret Lab.
[113.88 → 120.02] Let's jump right into our first topic, which is not going to be the stupid Elon thing.
[120.16 → 123.04] Instead, it's going to be talking about Framework Laptop.
[123.44 → 126.36] There are two interesting things to announce from this week.
[126.46 → 129.60] This was originally posted on the forum by Michael Auto.
[129.60 → 131.82] That is the LTT forum.
[131.82 → 135.18] And the original article here is from Ars Technica.
[135.32 → 136.76] Let's see if I can remember how all this stuff works.
[136.82 → 137.30] There it is.
[137.74 → 138.16] That's right.
[138.38 → 145.08] You can buy the Framework Laptop's motherboard for $3.99 and make your own mini PC.
[145.08 → 148.08] This system could also...
[148.08 → 149.86] I mean, I guess it's not really a system.
[150.02 → 151.56] It's just like...
[151.56 → 151.98] It is.
[151.98 → 158.38] The ability to just use it outside the case, which should have just existed, but I guess didn't.
[158.82 → 163.86] This could also help you repurpose an old Framework board after upgrading.
[164.20 → 167.30] If, say, for example, you wanted to upgrade to...
[167.30 → 171.52] The new 12th gen motherboard.
[172.48 → 173.04] That's right.
[173.22 → 180.20] Pre-orders have opened up for Framework Laptops equipped with Intel's latest chips in both fully assembled and DIY SKUs.
[180.20 → 186.22] Likewise, the company now also sells standalone logic boards starting at $3.99 as we showed you just now.
[186.32 → 188.20] That's a Core i5-1135G7.
[188.52 → 190.30] 12th gen boards will be coming later.
[190.38 → 192.58] For now, they need them for completed systems.
[193.40 → 199.60] Framework also released schematics on GitHub to help people design their own 3D printable cases
[199.60 → 204.58] if they want to repurpose an old board for VESA-mounted AIO desktop use.
[204.78 → 205.84] This is awesome.
[205.84 → 211.96] This is the kind of reduce and reuses that help us avoid the third R word.
[212.42 → 212.98] Recycle.
[213.56 → 213.84] Okay?
[213.90 → 217.78] We don't want to recycle things that we can still be reducing or reusing.
[218.44 → 225.18] And this is one of the reasons that I got so angry when Apple first released their 5K iMac.
[225.18 → 232.18] Because previous iMacs actually had the ability to continue to breathe new life into them as a monitor
[232.18 → 234.54] once you were done with the computer inside.
[234.62 → 236.20] Generally a perfect monitor too.
[236.36 → 242.24] Now, there were justifiable reasons for Apple to not take that approach with the iMac 5K.
[242.34 → 249.66] It actually required a very special DisplayPort implementation to achieve that resolution at 60Hz at that time on DP1.
[249.66 → 252.04] I believe it was DP1.2.
[252.28 → 256.04] They had to bond together two connections, something, something, etc.
[256.12 → 256.56] It doesn't matter.
[256.66 → 260.86] The point is that nowadays they could absolutely re-enable it.
[261.00 → 266.16] But now that they've normalized not being able to continue to use your AIO computer as a monitor
[266.16 → 269.72] once the computer is not useful, they've just been like, eh, forget it.
[269.72 → 274.38] And to be clear, anyone else who doesn't do that sucks too.
[274.84 → 281.10] But the reason that I harp on Apple as much as I do is that as Apple goes, the rest of the industry tends to follow.
[281.20 → 286.08] Because you can't possibly not be featured for feature competitive with Apple.
[286.16 → 287.96] Otherwise, you're going to look like a flippin' idiot.
[287.96 → 293.34] So, Apple's got all this extra pressure on them to set a good example.
[293.68 → 300.16] And they take all that pressure, crumple it up into a ball, and throw it in a fire because they just don't care.
[301.20 → 302.12] It's hilarious.
[302.18 → 309.78] Have you seen any of the new accounts coming out of sort of the rift between Joni Ive and Tim Cook
[309.78 → 311.62] and, like, how he ended up splitting?
[311.62 → 318.86] Because, get this, Joni Ive felt like Apple was being far too utilitarian-focused in its designs.
[319.86 → 320.30] Whoa.
[320.42 → 321.66] Good riddance, Joni!
[321.92 → 322.40] Whoa.
[322.86 → 324.58] Because that ain't the problem.
[324.98 → 325.46] That's great.
[325.54 → 326.10] Do you know where he's going?
[326.60 → 327.62] No, he left ages ago.
[328.20 → 329.26] This was way back.
[329.34 → 329.78] This was way back.
[329.86 → 333.80] He runs his own, like, design firm, if you, I guess, want to.
[334.48 → 336.82] I was going to Google it, but I don't care.
[337.44 → 338.44] Yeah, fair enough.
[338.58 → 338.80] Yep.
[339.16 → 339.68] Sounds good.
[339.68 → 349.22] In other news, speaking of schematics, Framework also published semi-complete technical schematics for the laptop boards as well.
[349.56 → 356.32] It's not hugely detailed, but the surrounding sentiment so far is that it represents a good start.
[356.74 → 361.56] Considering that no other manufacturers have any publicly available schematics to speak of,
[361.92 → 365.36] I consider this at least a step in the right direction for them.
[365.36 → 375.02] But, as always, my stance on my framework investment is going to be that if they do not continue to live up to their promises,
[375.36 → 381.58] to you, and to me, my intention is to dump their stock publicly, messily.
[382.00 → 383.28] They knew this going into it.
[383.64 → 386.18] And that was kind of like half the value for them, I think.
[386.28 → 386.64] Oh, yeah.
[386.64 → 391.52] Is that I've essentially got a gun to their head being like, no, for real, though.
[391.72 → 395.28] I might just be a shareholder and a relatively minor one at that.
[395.44 → 398.70] But if you guys this up, it's going to be really bad.
[399.06 → 400.10] Like, terrible.
[400.22 → 403.50] You're theoretically the canary, right, in this scenario.
[404.02 → 404.96] Which is cool.
[405.14 → 406.84] It's kind of nice that they have that.
[406.84 → 410.44] So, this is, wow, this is actually really helpful.
[410.66 → 412.12] You are their don't be evil.
[413.02 → 414.16] I like it.
[414.16 → 417.12] Except if they don't be evil goes away this time, it won't be, like, quiet.
[417.94 → 418.58] It'll be loud.
[418.84 → 421.06] And I've got you guys to hold me accountable.
[421.64 → 421.88] Yeah.
[422.26 → 423.44] This is actually great.
[423.54 → 427.10] So, they've got part numbers.
[427.10 → 432.28] They've got what voltages these are supposed to be running at.
[432.68 → 435.64] Which, yeah, like, okay, yeah, it's not perfect.
[435.94 → 438.46] But even just having, like, pinouts for things.
[438.80 → 442.08] A lot of this can be reverse engineered, as we've seen.
[442.92 → 446.06] But what if, what if, what if?
[446.96 → 447.94] You didn't have to.
[448.34 → 449.00] Thank you.
[449.10 → 449.32] Yeah.
[449.76 → 451.48] What if we just didn't have to?
[451.78 → 455.74] What if you just went, hey, you guys are going to figure this out anyway.
[455.74 → 459.20] Why don't we all just work together?
[460.36 → 461.86] I love it.
[462.50 → 463.48] I'm extremely happy.
[464.06 → 467.24] I wish they had Ry zen 2 Borg 666.
[467.60 → 468.56] I truly do.
[469.16 → 473.00] I, I have to, I have to believe that they are working on that.
[473.00 → 479.68] I think the reality of it is that AMD just has not had chips to fulfill orders with over the last 18 months.
[480.18 → 483.20] Since their laptop SKUs have actually been competitive.
[483.98 → 485.00] And if AMD.
[485.00 → 485.60] It's a lot held, right?
[485.74 → 492.06] If AMD has to allocate silicon to something these days, I think we can all agree it needs to be Steam Deck's.
[493.46 → 494.10] I still.
[494.10 → 494.74] Get an email yet?
[494.84 → 495.08] No.
[495.44 → 496.42] When did you order?
[497.74 → 500.96] Uh, I ordered on WAN show.
[501.12 → 503.14] I don't know if it was announced that day.
[504.20 → 506.96] Um, but if it was announced that day, I ordered that day.
[507.00 → 508.04] But within the first week.
[508.14 → 508.32] Yeah.
[508.32 → 515.68] So anyone who waited for any of our, you know, future coverage, you know, showing off the hardware or anything like that.
[515.68 → 519.20] Oh, here's a here's a potentially interesting take on it.
[519.20 → 520.36] I don't know if I've mentioned this or not yet.
[520.50 → 522.28] I don't, I don't know if I'm going to get it at this point.
[522.84 → 523.16] Really?
[523.46 → 523.70] Yeah.
[524.12 → 524.40] Why?
[524.66 → 534.54] Because a big part of the reason why I wanted to get it in the first place was the same kind of reason why I was really into, like, buying those early, uh, VR devices.
[535.08 → 537.20] It's because it was really cool to be on, like.
[537.34 → 538.20] That cutting edge.
[538.42 → 538.62] Yeah.
[538.62 → 542.32] Yeah, you've already missed a ton of software changes on it.
[542.42 → 542.60] Yeah.
[542.68 → 545.38] Like, it's a different device than it was the first day I got it.
[545.38 → 547.70] I'm going to get it, like, a year after it launched.
[547.98 → 552.70] Not only that, but it's not like the handheld gaming PC market is standing still.
[552.86 → 552.96] Oh.
[553.60 → 555.28] Uh, is this embargoed?
[556.92 → 558.62] Uh, hold on a second.
[558.78 → 562.08] Let me just find out if anyone's talking about this.
[562.92 → 564.62] Uh, one second, please.
[565.30 → 566.90] They're still working on day one applicants?
[566.90 → 567.32] Yeah.
[567.80 → 568.14] Wow.
[568.62 → 569.06] Really?
[569.42 → 569.82] Apparently.
[570.50 → 573.42] Why this is someone in flow play shows to that, I don't know.
[574.68 → 578.16] But, I mean, I believe them, considering they still haven't got to mind, like, they can't be that.
[578.36 → 582.42] Okay, this is apparently out there, so I guess it's fine.
[583.10 → 586.60] Uh, but I just got my hands on this.
[586.70 → 589.88] It's a Gun dam edition of the One X Player Mini.
[590.40 → 591.62] And, like, I know I've...
[591.62 → 592.90] Wow, that looks sick.
[592.90 → 597.32] I know I have trumpeted the Aya Neo a lot.
[597.32 → 610.80] But I have to say, as far as colourways and designs go, this is so much better than what anyone else has done so far that it just blows my mind.
[610.80 → 611.64] It looks insane.
[611.64 → 613.68] Like, the buttons look amazing.
[613.68 → 619.38] The semimetallic look that they got on these buttons looks flippin' unbelievable.
[619.66 → 619.88] Wow.
[619.88 → 625.08] And Aya has actually just announced an OLED version of their...
[625.08 → 625.86] I forget what it is.
[625.94 → 627.88] It's the Aya Neo 2, I think they're calling it.
[628.18 → 629.00] But it's OLED.
[629.00 → 631.00] It's going to be RDNA...
[631.74 → 632.00] RDNA...
[632.88 → 634.52] What RDNA are we on now?
[634.88 → 636.12] RDNA 3 or whatever.
[636.42 → 637.94] So it's going to be next-gen...
[637.94 → 638.94] Next-gen graphics.
[639.62 → 641.04] It's going to have...
[641.04 → 641.46] What is it?
[641.52 → 642.02] Ry zen...
[642.02 → 642.72] Ry zen 6000?
[643.30 → 644.16] Okay, hold on.
[644.22 → 644.92] Aya Neo 2.
[645.84 → 646.20] All in it.
[646.26 → 647.84] Ry zen 6800U.
[649.22 → 651.22] Ry zen 6800U specs.
[651.46 → 652.68] I think it's RDNA 3.
[653.10 → 655.04] I'm having trouble keeping track of everything these days.
[655.04 → 657.74] There are so many numbers and so many letters.
[658.32 → 659.20] Just show it to me.
[660.40 → 661.00] Radeon6ADM.
[661.12 → 661.82] Yeah, I believe so.
[662.18 → 666.52] So it's apparently OLED, which is going to be the first of its kind.
[666.62 → 670.74] That's one of my big complaints about the Steam Deck, is that the screen is fine.
[671.52 → 672.42] It's not great.
[672.56 → 673.02] It's fine.
[673.22 → 677.24] It's a value device screen, but a well-done one, you know?
[677.84 → 684.12] And so by the time you could get a response to your application to buy a Steam Deck,
[684.12 → 687.10] there could be devices that just make way more sense.
[687.30 → 687.70] That's for sure.
[687.90 → 693.06] And the whole early adopter ness is going to be gone, which is something that I like a lot.
[693.52 → 694.32] I just...
[694.32 → 695.12] I don't know.
[696.22 → 699.32] I suspect by the time they email me, and they're like,
[699.40 → 701.96] hey, you can spend hundreds of dollars on this,
[702.34 → 704.08] I'm just not actually going to be that interested anymore.
[704.32 → 706.12] Well, what might happen...
[706.12 → 706.14] Knowing myself.
[706.46 → 708.06] Having your place in line, though,
[708.06 → 711.60] I mean, if by that time Valve is upgrading the Steam Deck,
[712.06 → 715.20] and it's going to have a next generation SOC,
[715.48 → 717.88] that might be the only way to be first in line for it.
[718.06 → 719.58] The timing might be good, yeah.
[719.68 → 720.18] Yeah, the timing might...
[720.18 → 720.60] We'll see.
[720.82 → 722.52] I don't even know if you can.
[722.60 → 724.50] I haven't cancelled my spotted line.
[725.18 → 729.24] I just don't 100% know of when they finally do offer it,
[729.26 → 730.34] if I'll still even be interested.
[731.62 → 732.32] We'll see.
[732.32 → 736.32] Aya has apparently not released pricing for the Aya Neo 2,
[736.54 → 738.90] and I don't have any insider information,
[739.14 → 744.32] but it would surprise me a lot if the pricing was the same as what they have done previously,
[744.48 → 747.28] rather than being more competitive with the Steam Deck.
[752.36 → 752.88] Alright.
[756.36 → 757.32] Discussion question.
[758.30 → 761.38] What is the biggest omission in framework schematic drop?
[761.38 → 763.34] Yeah, I don't think either Luke or I is...
[763.34 → 764.44] We'd have to dive through the whole thing.
[764.44 → 764.70] Yeah.
[765.60 → 766.78] Prepared for that kind of...
[766.78 → 768.68] A lot more deeply than Sancho allows.
[769.28 → 770.00] Thanks for the...
[770.00 → 774.14] Thanks for the complete bus throw, Jonathan Horst,
[774.66 → 778.38] by putting that question in there for us.
[779.60 → 782.02] What sort of public policy related to schematics
[782.02 → 785.24] would be fair to manufacturers and repair shops alike?
[785.32 → 787.16] Okay, that's a better discussion question.
[787.88 → 788.22] Luke,
[788.22 → 793.34] how can a manufacturer protect their IP
[793.34 → 799.86] while also allowing for third-party repair shops to repair these devices?
[800.02 → 804.16] Because first-party repair is not always a good answer,
[804.28 → 807.78] depending on where you are or what your financial means are.
[807.90 → 809.26] It just might not make sense.
[809.32 → 812.12] And then there's that whole reduce-reuse thing.
[812.12 → 815.32] Like, even if it doesn't make a ton of financial sense,
[815.58 → 820.10] shouldn't we enable people to keep these items out of the shredder?
[820.50 → 822.68] It's kind of actually a pretty tough question
[822.68 → 824.72] because you could just say like,
[824.76 → 825.76] oh, like patent it, whatever.
[826.02 → 829.46] But that doesn't necessarily work all that great,
[829.54 → 831.68] especially once you get to out-of-country manufacturers.
[831.92 → 832.02] Oh, yeah.
[832.10 → 832.96] No, it's difficult.
[833.34 → 834.96] And then you could also say like,
[835.04 → 837.54] oh, well, you should just like stick to your ethics
[837.54 → 838.84] and your morals and whatever.
[838.84 → 842.24] And then like be the company that people want to buy from.
[842.50 → 843.76] And like, yeah, sure.
[843.76 → 844.66] That's all great.
[844.66 → 848.50] But then the world population has shown that
[848.50 → 849.76] if something's cheaper,
[849.76 → 851.98] they don't much care about anything else.
[853.56 → 855.24] So it's kind of tough.
[855.64 → 856.10] I don't know.
[856.40 → 858.62] Making policy for that is going to be kind of tough.
[858.62 → 859.74] I think a...
[862.40 → 863.62] Yeah, I don't know.
[864.42 → 866.72] Finding something that is going to work universally.
[867.02 → 868.58] So a situation where it's policy
[868.58 → 872.78] does genuinely sound pretty hard
[872.78 → 875.08] in regard to forcing people
[875.08 → 876.96] to make things like schematics available.
[878.24 → 880.76] And I don't know if the right to repair movement
[880.76 → 882.10] actually goes that far.
[883.02 → 886.36] I mean, the thing for me is that
[886.36 → 889.84] I feel like anything that can be found
[889.84 → 892.68] by simply analyzing it
[892.68 → 894.76] might as well just be provided.
[895.02 → 895.34] For sure.
[895.50 → 897.24] So how do you make policy around that?
[898.22 → 899.74] Because that's the thing
[899.74 → 900.98] that I'm currently getting hooked up on
[900.98 → 902.54] is they specifically said policy.
[903.16 → 904.04] Yeah, it's tough.
[904.18 → 906.54] I mean, for my knee-jerk reaction
[906.54 → 911.36] is that I might not want to...
[912.04 → 912.74] Oh, see, this is tough.
[912.82 → 913.72] I was about to say,
[913.72 → 917.14] I might not want to force manufacturers
[917.14 → 920.06] to reveal the model of chip that they're using.
[921.08 → 924.70] But then they have to reveal the trace layout,
[924.82 → 925.24] for example,
[925.30 → 926.86] because that's something that we could just x-ray
[926.86 → 930.72] and find if we were willing to put the time into it.
[930.80 → 931.78] And all you're really doing
[931.78 → 932.94] is increasing the barrier
[932.94 → 934.62] between large repair shops
[934.62 → 936.82] and small mom-and-pop repair shops.
[936.84 → 938.86] But then if we don't reveal...
[938.86 → 940.12] If we don't tell them
[940.12 → 942.24] they have to reveal which chips are being used,
[942.24 → 943.98] well, then all of a sudden,
[944.24 → 946.14] well, if there's a failed component on the board,
[946.22 → 946.68] so okay, what?
[946.74 → 947.60] You've got a blown trace.
[947.70 → 949.48] Now you can painstakingly
[949.48 → 951.74] put a hair-sized wire in to repair that.
[952.20 → 953.90] But if you can't replace the component
[953.90 → 955.76] that caused the trace to blow in the first place,
[955.84 → 957.04] then it's not really useful.
[958.04 → 959.94] I mean, you could...
[959.94 → 960.94] Okay, here's something.
[960.94 → 969.72] You could have like a stair-step style level of responsibility.
[970.56 → 971.88] So right at release,
[972.32 → 974.52] you know, within some period of time,
[974.62 → 975.64] let's say a year,
[976.18 → 976.74] you can say,
[976.84 → 977.96] look, everything is trade secret.
[978.12 → 980.14] Especially at the rate that technology moves,
[980.74 → 981.34] within a year,
[981.42 → 981.76] you could say,
[981.84 → 983.06] okay, everything is trade secret.
[983.34 → 985.90] Within two years or 36 months,
[985.90 → 989.40] there's an additional responsibility to release it.
[989.58 → 992.28] And then the second that the product is EOL,
[992.82 → 994.98] the second you are no longer producing,
[995.50 → 995.94] let's say,
[996.04 → 998.00] brand-new ones or replacement parts,
[998.14 → 999.74] or maybe each of those events
[999.74 → 1001.88] triggers a new level of disclosure,
[1002.68 → 1005.72] by the time this product is completely EOL
[1005.72 → 1007.94] and you are no longer supporting it in any way,
[1007.94 → 1009.30] it is my belief
[1009.30 → 1011.62] that the full schematics just need to be published.
[1011.62 → 1015.02] Yeah, and there's potentially another way to approach this
[1015.02 → 1016.22] that I thought of while you were talking,
[1016.36 → 1016.94] which is like,
[1017.24 → 1018.08] like you're talking,
[1018.18 → 1019.56] and this is generally how policy goes,
[1019.62 → 1020.08] it makes sense,
[1020.14 → 1021.10] but you're talking about like
[1021.10 → 1023.60] restrictions that maybe lift over time.
[1023.94 → 1024.34] Yeah.
[1025.48 → 1027.86] Or I guess more restrictions
[1027.86 → 1029.12] that come in place over time.
[1029.32 → 1031.56] You have to release more things over time,
[1031.58 → 1032.52] which kind of makes sense to me
[1032.52 → 1033.98] because it's going to be more interesting
[1033.98 → 1034.88] to repair this thing
[1034.88 → 1036.04] after it's been out for a year,
[1036.34 → 1037.36] 24 months, et cetera.
[1037.82 → 1040.12] Yeah, and it's going to be more likely to come up,
[1040.60 → 1040.88] right?
[1040.88 → 1041.48] Like I,
[1041.70 → 1043.72] most of them aren't going to fail in the first year.
[1043.80 → 1044.22] And if they do,
[1044.32 → 1046.34] they're going to be immediately replaced under warranty.
[1046.56 → 1046.70] Yeah.
[1047.08 → 1048.78] So once you would get to the
[1048.78 → 1050.80] the external repair shop stage,
[1050.82 → 1051.76] those things would be available.
[1052.40 → 1054.06] But I could also see
[1054.06 → 1056.24] a more positive reinforcement angle
[1056.24 → 1057.22] potentially working
[1057.22 → 1059.84] where you go the route of like innovation grants
[1059.84 → 1060.94] to,
[1060.94 → 1063.24] to companies that are willing to support things
[1063.24 → 1064.16] that are like right to repair.
[1064.40 → 1065.48] So like you,
[1065.68 → 1066.02] you know,
[1066.02 → 1067.18] the like up here,
[1067.18 → 1068.94] there's like shred and all that other stuff.
[1069.04 → 1069.18] Yeah.
[1069.18 → 1071.06] You could have that same system
[1071.06 → 1072.84] or maybe a very similar system
[1072.84 → 1074.34] start applying to companies
[1074.34 → 1076.96] that are willing to help repair shops
[1076.96 → 1078.82] keep their things around.
[1080.00 → 1081.80] Gremlin injector over on float planes
[1081.80 → 1083.08] got an interesting idea.
[1083.54 → 1085.64] It says EOL could be gamed.
[1086.10 → 1086.90] Yeah, that's fair enough.
[1086.90 → 1087.92] I mean, we've seen,
[1088.12 → 1089.94] we've seen dishonesty from manufacturers
[1089.94 → 1091.04] in terms of whether
[1091.04 → 1094.16] they are actually still producing a particular part.
[1094.28 → 1095.14] Like theoretically,
[1095.14 → 1096.40] it's up on their website,
[1096.40 → 1098.56] but no one's been able to buy it for six months.
[1099.52 → 1100.90] Why don't you just make it
[1100.90 → 1102.98] by the time the first unit sold
[1102.98 → 1104.36] is no longer under warranty?
[1104.68 → 1106.64] Because that puts pressure on manufacturers
[1106.64 → 1107.54] from two fronts.
[1107.68 → 1109.78] One is to support them for longer.
[1109.78 → 1113.78] And two is to provide more information.
[1114.34 → 1116.26] I think you'd need to get into the weeds
[1116.26 → 1118.82] of how you define warranties and stuff at that point.
[1118.96 → 1120.16] But that's something you could do.
[1121.44 → 1122.78] Doesn't seem insurmountable.
[1122.88 → 1123.30] That'd be cool.
[1123.44 → 1123.94] I'd like that.
[1124.44 → 1126.40] Alex P from our editing team asks,
[1126.54 → 1127.56] so what about bankruptcies
[1127.56 → 1128.78] or companies that disappear?
[1129.52 → 1130.82] I, man, see that's,
[1130.92 → 1131.94] that's tough.
[1132.28 → 1133.14] Now it's very,
[1133.60 → 1135.06] I shouldn't say very rare,
[1135.06 → 1137.64] but I think it's not,
[1137.74 → 1139.48] I think I'm pretty sure
[1139.48 → 1141.46] that it's less common these days
[1141.46 → 1144.14] for companies to utterly disappear
[1144.14 → 1145.72] the way they might have a hundred years ago
[1145.72 → 1148.68] because of how much value of a company
[1148.68 → 1150.66] is tied up in its intellectual property
[1150.66 → 1151.40] and its patents.
[1151.70 → 1153.94] So I would say that that responsibility
[1153.94 → 1157.32] should fall to whoever the acquirer is,
[1157.50 → 1158.82] whoever the acquiring party is.
[1158.94 → 1161.48] And if they do actually disappear outright,
[1161.98 → 1163.86] I see no reason whatsoever
[1163.86 → 1165.32] why that internal information
[1165.32 → 1166.52] shouldn't just be public domain.
[1166.76 → 1168.40] As for who administers that,
[1168.48 → 1169.74] well, that gets a lot more challenging.
[1171.78 → 1173.26] Gremlin Injector also said,
[1173.32 → 1175.10] innovation grants equals free money, LOL.
[1175.90 → 1176.38] Yeah.
[1176.70 → 1178.02] And it's crazy.
[1178.22 → 1179.44] I had a conversation with someone
[1179.44 → 1180.62] very recently about this,
[1180.98 → 1182.78] about how it's been very hard
[1182.78 → 1185.14] for us to get things like shred credits and stuff.
[1185.62 → 1186.56] Even when like,
[1186.72 → 1188.38] I'm not even trying for certain things
[1188.38 → 1189.38] that I know don't apply,
[1189.50 → 1190.60] but there are certain things that we do
[1190.60 → 1192.16] that a hundred percent applies.
[1192.16 → 1194.22] And we push for it.
[1194.22 → 1195.70] And then we end up getting in this situation
[1195.70 → 1198.48] where it like becomes this endless paper train
[1198.48 → 1200.00] that they want us to fight for.
[1200.16 → 1201.34] And then you look at,
[1201.54 → 1203.18] you look at mobile game developers
[1203.18 → 1205.98] and they have,
[1206.08 → 1207.50] the one that I know of the best
[1207.50 → 1209.20] has a department,
[1209.20 → 1211.58] which is a legal team department.
[1211.82 → 1213.42] Their entire job
[1213.42 → 1215.18] is capturing government grants.
[1215.28 → 1216.92] That's literally all they do
[1216.92 → 1217.96] throughout the entire year
[1217.96 → 1220.00] is they fight legal battles
[1220.00 → 1220.84] for government grants.
[1220.96 → 1221.66] And I'm like,
[1221.70 → 1223.04] yeah, it sucks that
[1223.04 → 1224.52] that is a profitable thing
[1224.52 → 1225.46] to have on your team.
[1225.46 → 1225.88] That sucks.
[1226.22 → 1227.34] Personally, I think that sucks.
[1227.42 → 1227.68] I don't know.
[1227.72 → 1228.44] I don't want to get like
[1228.44 → 1229.42] way into the weeds of it,
[1229.48 → 1230.80] but that's unfortunate.
[1231.44 → 1232.52] Oh, production services,
[1232.62 → 1234.46] tax credits are the exact same thing.
[1234.52 → 1234.92] I'm sure.
[1235.06 → 1237.28] By the time you reach the scale
[1237.28 → 1239.12] where you can engage
[1239.12 → 1240.32] with the government of Canada
[1240.32 → 1242.18] and get that stuff pushed through,
[1242.68 → 1244.32] you don't need it nearly as badly
[1244.32 → 1245.96] as you did five years ago
[1245.96 → 1247.52] when you didn't have
[1247.52 → 1248.68] the kind of time and resources.
[1248.92 → 1250.92] It's extraordinarily frustrating.
[1251.16 → 1252.46] And that entire industry
[1252.46 → 1254.04] seems to be set up
[1254.04 → 1256.34] to make sure that that information
[1256.34 → 1258.94] doesn't leak outside the
[1259.36 → 1260.38] I'm going to use the term
[1260.38 → 1261.36] old boys club,
[1261.40 → 1263.06] even though there are plenty of not boys
[1263.06 → 1264.30] who are not old in it.
[1264.46 → 1265.56] But I think you understand
[1265.56 → 1267.44] the connotation of an old boys club.
[1267.96 → 1269.78] They don't want that information
[1269.78 → 1271.20] about how to do it to leak out.
[1271.46 → 1272.36] There are so many things
[1272.36 → 1273.02] that are like that.
[1273.02 → 1274.02] Like you'd think it's just
[1274.02 → 1274.94] wouldn't be political.
[1275.74 → 1277.02] Realtors are the same way.
[1277.28 → 1278.16] Like you've got,
[1278.32 → 1279.94] we have encountered situations
[1279.94 → 1282.32] where we know for a fact
[1282.32 → 1284.64] that especially commercial realtors
[1284.64 → 1285.56] are the worst,
[1285.78 → 1287.14] where they are absolutely
[1287.14 → 1290.52] not acting in good faith
[1290.52 → 1291.14] in the
[1291.30 → 1293.00] to best represent their client
[1293.00 → 1294.46] because they'll basically,
[1295.02 → 1296.06] we've been told.
[1296.18 → 1296.80] They get a percentage.
[1296.98 → 1297.84] So if it sells for more,
[1297.90 → 1298.48] they make more money.
[1298.56 → 1299.66] Well, no, not just that.
[1299.74 → 1300.86] We've been told in the past
[1300.86 → 1302.10] that they won't even look
[1302.10 → 1302.76] at our offer
[1302.76 → 1304.24] unless we are represented
[1304.24 → 1305.78] by a commercial realtor
[1305.78 → 1306.48] that they approve,
[1306.88 → 1307.46] for example.
[1307.92 → 1308.96] Like the selling retails.
[1309.26 → 1309.58] Yeah.
[1309.86 → 1310.00] Yeah.
[1310.36 → 1312.14] So, so our representative
[1312.14 → 1313.52] needs to be like their buddy
[1313.52 → 1315.92] so that everyone can just,
[1316.38 → 1316.66] you know.
[1316.86 → 1317.06] Yeah.
[1317.32 → 1318.48] It's 100%.
[1318.48 → 1318.94] Yeah.
[1319.08 → 1319.68] It's gross.
[1320.00 → 1320.16] Yeah.
[1320.20 → 1320.96] It's gross.
[1321.20 → 1322.74] And like, okay,
[1322.90 → 1324.24] residential real estate,
[1324.58 → 1325.44] generally speaking,
[1325.44 → 1326.44] does a pretty good job
[1326.44 → 1327.44] of ending up on MLS
[1327.44 → 1328.86] or Too or whatever else.
[1329.38 → 1331.22] Commercial very rarely does.
[1331.22 → 1333.20] It usually changes hands
[1333.20 → 1335.04] before even being publicly listed.
[1335.18 → 1336.30] And a lot of the public listings
[1336.30 → 1337.02] are just like,
[1337.82 → 1338.74] it's like the client
[1338.74 → 1339.84] forced them to do it.
[1340.18 → 1342.14] Like just utterly bare bones,
[1342.46 → 1343.62] almost never pricing.
[1344.04 → 1345.50] Like most of the information
[1345.50 → 1346.60] you need isn't there.
[1346.80 → 1348.92] So you end up having to contact them
[1348.92 → 1349.94] and go and see it anyway.
[1350.00 → 1350.88] And it's by design.
[1351.04 → 1352.74] It's so that they don't have to work
[1352.74 → 1355.02] with anyone that they don't want to.
[1355.02 → 1357.36] I hate it.
[1357.42 → 1359.98] The whole realtor grift
[1359.98 → 1361.14] is
[1361.14 → 1364.92] extremely frustrating,
[1365.06 → 1365.62] which isn't to say
[1365.62 → 1366.96] that I don't use one
[1366.96 → 1368.42] or value the services
[1368.42 → 1370.28] that ours provides.
[1370.66 → 1372.72] A very, very knowledgeable
[1372.72 → 1376.16] broker or agent
[1376.16 → 1378.06] or whatever else
[1378.06 → 1378.72] or assistant
[1378.72 → 1380.00] or whatever you want to call it.
[1380.00 → 1382.80] When you're going through
[1382.80 → 1383.90] a transaction
[1383.90 → 1386.32] that is likely to be,
[1386.44 → 1387.56] if not will be,
[1387.60 → 1389.14] the largest that you will go through
[1389.14 → 1390.26] in your entire life,
[1390.70 → 1392.32] having an expert guiding hand
[1392.32 → 1394.22] can be pretty useful.
[1394.54 → 1395.06] It's just that
[1395.06 → 1396.02] most of the ones
[1396.02 → 1396.78] that I've encountered
[1396.78 → 1398.26] are flippin' idiots
[1398.26 → 1399.46] who are just looking
[1399.46 → 1400.48] to make a quick buck.
[1400.86 → 1401.02] Yeah.
[1401.78 → 1402.32] I mean,
[1402.34 → 1403.26] there's a lot of money in it.
[1403.26 → 1406.42] Yeah, there really
[1406.42 → 1407.80] shouldn't be
[1407.80 → 1408.88] as much as there is.
[1408.98 → 1409.64] No offence.
[1409.82 → 1411.26] Canada's real estate situation.
[1411.56 → 1411.68] Yeah.
[1411.86 → 1412.14] You know?
[1412.74 → 1413.70] Alright, what are we supposed
[1413.70 → 1414.28] to be talking about?
[1414.44 → 1415.68] Stuff, tech things.
[1417.32 → 1418.82] Not real estate.
[1419.02 → 1419.36] No, no.
[1419.50 → 1420.68] I want to talk about
[1420.68 → 1421.92] LTTstore.com.
[1422.00 → 1422.42] Hey!
[1423.56 → 1425.22] Okay, you guys complained.
[1425.74 → 1426.64] We heard you.
[1427.06 → 1428.56] The women's sweatpants
[1428.56 → 1430.22] and crop top sweaters
[1430.22 → 1431.28] are now available
[1431.28 → 1432.72] with embroidery.
[1434.06 → 1434.94] That's right!
[1435.40 → 1436.58] You can now get
[1436.58 → 1437.72] all the tech tips
[1437.72 → 1439.30] embroidered on your sweater.
[1440.60 → 1441.50] Look at that.
[1442.52 → 1442.96] Nice.
[1443.14 → 1444.16] It just says tech tips?
[1444.84 → 1445.26] Well, what?
[1445.32 → 1445.92] You want it to say
[1445.92 → 1446.96] something other than that?
[1448.88 → 1449.50] I don't know.
[1449.96 → 1450.40] I don't know.
[1450.96 → 1452.96] I like the rainbow one
[1452.96 → 1453.86] on the pants.
[1453.94 → 1454.96] Yeah, the rainbow one's sweet.
[1455.10 → 1456.14] The rainbow one's pretty dope.
[1456.68 → 1456.96] Yeah.
[1457.44 → 1458.32] So we have a couple
[1458.32 → 1459.00] different designs.
[1459.14 → 1459.98] Oh, there's two.
[1460.06 → 1460.78] Okay, okay.
[1460.78 → 1461.28] I get it.
[1461.38 → 1462.38] Yeah, these are
[1462.38 → 1463.54] pre-orders.
[1464.18 → 1465.06] So they're expected
[1465.06 → 1467.04] to ship by May 25th, 2022.
[1467.50 → 1468.34] We're getting them
[1468.34 → 1469.10] embroidered locally.
[1470.06 → 1471.66] So embroidered in Canada.
[1471.80 → 1473.04] Yo, the block design
[1473.04 → 1473.52] is cool.
[1474.04 → 1474.70] The block design
[1474.70 → 1475.20] is really cool.
[1475.30 → 1475.82] That's not actually
[1475.82 → 1476.54] the one I preferred.
[1476.64 → 1477.18] I preferred the person one.
[1477.18 → 1478.18] You like the script one?
[1478.34 → 1478.88] I did.
[1479.36 → 1480.58] Yeah, I like the block one.
[1481.30 → 1482.40] And in other news,
[1482.58 → 1483.62] we've got another promo.
[1483.78 → 1485.42] We do have some items
[1485.42 → 1486.54] we need to get moving
[1486.54 → 1487.48] a little bit faster.
[1487.48 → 1489.06] So if you use code
[1489.06 → 1490.06] MEMORY
[1490.06 → 1492.04] for the next seven days
[1492.04 → 1493.08] and pick up
[1493.08 → 1494.04] a Linus selfie
[1494.04 → 1495.74] or sad Linus desk pad,
[1495.94 → 1496.64] you will get
[1496.64 → 1497.80] the sequin pillow
[1497.80 → 1499.72] for the price
[1499.72 → 1500.96] of $0.
[1501.64 → 1502.50] That's right.
[1502.86 → 1504.12] It will be included
[1504.12 → 1504.82] for you.
[1506.10 → 1506.58] Dang.
[1506.82 → 1507.38] Very cool.
[1507.48 → 1507.92] Here, hold on.
[1507.92 → 1508.70] I'm just going to go ahead
[1508.70 → 1509.48] and bring these up
[1509.48 → 1510.48] so you guys can see.
[1511.12 → 1512.00] Linus's screen.
[1512.14 → 1512.76] Here, let's scroll through
[1512.76 → 1513.80] all the other things
[1513.80 → 1514.88] that we might actually
[1514.88 → 1515.80] make money on.
[1515.80 → 1517.60] Oh, wait.
[1517.72 → 1518.86] Nick says the date is wrong.
[1518.98 → 1519.40] Hold on.
[1519.94 → 1520.40] Uh-oh.
[1520.76 → 1521.78] It's not May 25th.
[1521.78 → 1522.78] I need to update that.
[1522.86 → 1523.08] Sorry.
[1523.20 → 1523.62] Oh, no.
[1523.84 → 1525.48] Oh, the 27th or something.
[1525.60 → 1526.14] I don't know.
[1526.20 → 1526.44] Soon.
[1527.04 → 1527.32] Soon.
[1527.74 → 1528.94] Anyway, here's some
[1528.94 → 1530.30] actually profitable things
[1530.30 → 1531.20] I'm going to scroll past
[1531.20 → 1532.58] that you guys could also buy
[1532.58 → 1535.30] as part of your order
[1535.30 → 1536.92] when you're getting free pillows.
[1537.44 → 1538.16] So if you pick up
[1538.16 → 1539.68] either of these mouse pads,
[1540.22 → 1540.78] the desk pad
[1540.78 → 1541.66] or the mouse pad,
[1542.22 → 1542.84] you will get
[1542.84 → 1544.40] this sequin pillow
[1544.40 → 1545.66] or, oh, one of them.
[1546.16 → 1546.48] Okay.
[1546.62 → 1546.86] Cool.
[1547.50 → 1547.92] There you go.
[1548.12 → 1549.08] My reviews are excellent
[1549.08 → 1549.88] for the sequin pillow.
[1549.98 → 1551.88] We just ordered
[1551.88 → 1552.64] too many of them.
[1555.60 → 1556.42] It happens.
[1557.20 → 1557.64] It's part of the
[1557.64 → 1557.96] inventory.
[1559.04 → 1559.80] What are we talking
[1559.80 → 1560.40] about next?
[1560.56 → 1561.10] We take the lab
[1561.10 → 1561.78] in X days.
[1563.44 → 1564.08] Oh, sure.
[1564.18 → 1564.38] Yeah.
[1564.38 → 1565.22] Let's talk about that.
[1565.52 → 1566.86] I can't believe
[1566.86 → 1568.54] you are going to
[1568.54 → 1569.30] have an office
[1569.30 → 1570.98] for the first time,
[1571.14 → 1571.94] I think,
[1572.02 → 1572.86] since you worked here.
[1573.56 → 1574.30] Private office
[1574.30 → 1575.44] in 12 days.
[1575.98 → 1576.20] No.
[1576.40 → 1576.86] When did you have
[1576.86 → 1577.72] a private office before?
[1577.92 → 1578.92] I had your office
[1578.92 → 1580.40] for like a long time.
[1580.42 → 1581.28] Oh, yeah, that's true.
[1581.42 → 1582.04] And then I took it.
[1582.10 → 1582.76] And then you took it.
[1583.02 → 1583.92] Well, I mean, in fairness,
[1584.10 → 1584.80] you were not in it.
[1584.82 → 1584.84] And then now,
[1584.84 → 1585.84] I work in the lounge.
[1586.20 → 1586.50] Yes.
[1586.66 → 1587.34] Well, okay.
[1587.44 → 1589.36] So for the second time.
[1589.36 → 1590.52] That's literally falling apart.
[1590.76 → 1591.44] For the second time.
[1591.46 → 1592.02] It's awesome.
[1592.46 → 1593.72] You can afford a new laptop.
[1594.04 → 1594.26] Yeah.
[1594.38 → 1595.58] And if you needed one issued,
[1595.66 → 1596.88] you could just ask logistics.
[1596.94 → 1597.66] I don't want to ask.
[1597.76 → 1598.28] No, I know.
[1598.40 → 1598.68] I know.
[1598.80 → 1599.00] I know.
[1599.00 → 1599.36] I know.
[1599.58 → 1600.30] This is how.
[1601.32 → 1602.10] This is how.
[1602.22 → 1602.56] You know what?
[1602.56 → 1603.16] The laptop's actually
[1603.16 → 1603.98] completely fine.
[1604.08 → 1604.58] I don't want anyone.
[1605.30 → 1606.26] You can see.
[1606.26 → 1607.02] You can see the topic.
[1607.18 → 1607.44] Okay?
[1607.72 → 1608.92] You can see the topic
[1608.92 → 1610.14] right above that.
[1610.72 → 1610.98] What?
[1611.12 → 1611.48] Okay?
[1611.48 → 1615.74] I actually didn't read that.
[1615.76 → 1617.64] And you play into this narrative
[1617.64 → 1620.02] that I'm some kind of monster.
[1621.12 → 1622.18] Because it's funny.
[1622.92 → 1624.92] Yeah, but people think it's seriously.
[1625.34 → 1626.68] I still think it's funny.
[1626.72 → 1627.80] I think it's funny, too.
[1627.92 → 1628.18] We did.
[1628.26 → 1628.84] Oh, man.
[1629.14 → 1630.18] We did this intro
[1630.18 → 1631.68] for the moving vlog video
[1631.68 → 1632.28] where I'm like,
[1632.40 → 1634.74] I'm assembling my logistics Avengers.
[1635.52 → 1638.56] And the number of actually serious comments
[1638.56 → 1639.80] actually concerned
[1639.80 → 1641.46] that they look so unenthusiastic
[1641.46 → 1642.34] to be there.
[1642.60 → 1643.20] Like I have,
[1643.48 → 1645.06] like I have some kind of gun
[1645.06 → 1645.86] to their head
[1645.86 → 1648.34] forcing them to come help me move
[1648.34 → 1650.74] because I'm some kind of weird,
[1651.16 → 1653.80] awful, overbearing boss or something.
[1653.90 → 1654.76] And I'm sitting here going,
[1655.86 → 1657.88] they were told it's completely,
[1657.88 → 1659.66] completely optional.
[1660.00 → 1661.30] They were paid.
[1661.66 → 1662.00] Okay?
[1662.08 → 1662.88] They were paid.
[1663.04 → 1664.50] And they were instructed
[1664.50 → 1665.94] before that shot
[1665.94 → 1667.50] to look unenthusiastic
[1667.50 → 1669.16] because it's funny.
[1669.40 → 1669.62] Yeah.
[1669.62 → 1670.80] Because it's funny
[1670.80 → 1672.74] when people have to help someone move,
[1672.90 → 1673.92] it sucks.
[1674.58 → 1675.42] And you know what?
[1675.58 → 1675.98] It's...
[1675.98 → 1676.78] I don't think it sucks.
[1676.96 → 1677.88] I have always liked
[1677.88 → 1678.80] helping people move.
[1678.90 → 1679.50] Yeah, but it's like,
[1679.54 → 1680.28] it's a meme.
[1680.42 → 1681.42] It's because it's not me.
[1681.72 → 1682.20] If I...
[1682.20 → 1683.58] Every time I have had to move,
[1683.66 → 1684.26] I hate it.
[1684.56 → 1685.98] But if I help someone else move,
[1686.04 → 1686.34] it's like,
[1686.38 → 1686.96] oh, this is cool.
[1687.22 → 1688.54] Of course we had fun.
[1688.62 → 1689.46] We were hanging out
[1689.46 → 1690.32] for the whole day
[1690.32 → 1690.62] and like...
[1691.50 → 1692.20] Running around with...
[1692.20 → 1692.88] Running around with Andy
[1692.88 → 1694.08] yelling content at things
[1694.08 → 1694.88] was entertaining.
[1695.10 → 1695.60] Exactly.
[1695.76 → 1695.98] Content!
[1698.92 → 1700.44] And let me put it this way.
[1700.78 → 1701.28] They...
[1701.28 → 1702.84] They were fine.
[1703.14 → 1703.46] Okay?
[1703.72 → 1705.02] But we worked out a deal
[1705.02 → 1705.96] where it was fine.
[1706.40 → 1707.58] They just chill.
[1708.24 → 1709.40] It's unbelievable.
[1709.84 → 1710.90] I don't force people
[1710.90 → 1711.64] to work here.
[1711.70 → 1712.42] Like you ordered lunch
[1712.42 → 1713.02] for people too?
[1713.12 → 1714.10] I actually don't have
[1714.10 → 1714.72] that power.
[1715.46 → 1716.72] People didn't want to be here.
[1716.78 → 1717.80] They could just leave.
[1717.80 → 1719.28] I mean,
[1719.46 → 1720.30] some of them do.
[1720.70 → 1721.66] And they're fine.
[1721.90 → 1722.68] Because the people
[1722.68 → 1723.26] who work here
[1723.26 → 1724.44] are world-class employees.
[1724.70 → 1725.44] It's not hard for them
[1725.44 → 1726.78] to find a freaking job.
[1728.64 → 1728.92] Ugh!
[1730.76 → 1731.64] So if Luke's needed
[1731.64 → 1732.16] a new laptop,
[1732.60 → 1734.22] he could have one.
[1735.44 → 1736.16] You want a new laptop?
[1736.30 → 1736.62] No, Ashley.
[1736.62 → 1736.86] Here.
[1737.04 → 1737.46] No, no, no.
[1737.48 → 1737.76] Here.
[1738.02 → 1738.76] Just take it.
[1738.76 → 1739.64] I don't want it.
[1739.66 → 1740.26] Just take it.
[1740.48 → 1740.92] I know.
[1741.38 → 1742.06] Are you going to
[1742.06 → 1742.60] fall out another one?
[1742.60 → 1743.44] I don't want it anymore.
[1743.84 → 1745.70] I get two laptops now.
[1747.10 → 1747.54] Okay.
[1747.80 → 1748.10] There.
[1750.36 → 1750.68] Here.
[1750.80 → 1751.22] You know what?
[1751.24 → 1752.24] Just take this one too.
[1752.30 → 1752.62] Thank you.
[1752.72 → 1752.98] There.
[1753.06 → 1754.04] I actually want this one more.
[1754.04 → 1754.26] I'm going to go get more.
[1754.48 → 1755.26] I'll keep this one.
[1755.84 → 1756.72] This one's pretty sweet.
[1757.86 → 1758.38] Yeah, I don't want
[1758.38 → 1759.28] a new laptop, actually.
[1759.34 → 1760.04] Unless it's this one.
[1760.12 → 1760.96] I would keep this one.
[1760.98 → 1761.56] This one's sick.
[1762.70 → 1763.10] Yeah, I mean,
[1763.12 → 1763.80] I'll take a laptop.
[1764.10 → 1764.46] You want one?
[1764.50 → 1765.00] Yeah, I mean,
[1765.12 → 1766.28] if they're being handed out.
[1766.36 → 1767.44] No, you can take this one.
[1767.54 → 1767.92] Oh, thanks.
[1768.00 → 1768.74] I'll come grab it later.
[1768.74 → 1769.44] Yeah, yeah, no worries.
[1769.62 → 1770.18] You can have that one.
[1770.44 → 1771.38] That one's the coolest one.
[1772.64 → 1774.28] Yeah, so the laptop's fine,
[1774.42 → 1775.54] which is why I don't have a new one.
[1775.98 → 1776.84] It is falling apart.
[1777.54 → 1778.58] My goodness.
[1780.40 → 1781.38] Oh, God.
[1782.52 → 1784.26] Oh, I hope this is a folding laptop.
[1784.50 → 1785.22] I think it is.
[1788.12 → 1789.98] Is that enough laptops for you?
[1790.90 → 1792.34] This is a folding laptop, right?
[1792.48 → 1793.42] Yeah, it has that kind of hinge.
[1793.68 → 1794.08] I think it's fine.
[1794.12 → 1794.74] Oh, God.
[1795.26 → 1795.54] Okay.
[1795.80 → 1796.14] Okay.
[1796.46 → 1796.90] Okay.
[1796.90 → 1798.58] Now we have enough laptops.
[1799.36 → 1800.94] So we've solved that problem
[1800.94 → 1802.50] once and for all.
[1802.50 → 1802.86] Yeah.
[1806.36 → 1806.76] Yeah.
[1809.06 → 1809.46] Yeah.
[1811.18 → 1811.94] Eventually, I'll be able
[1811.94 → 1812.96] to see my laptop again.
[1815.22 → 1815.98] There we go.
[1816.12 → 1816.38] Perfect.
[1816.68 → 1818.06] Anyway, we take the lab
[1818.06 → 1819.70] in 12 days.
[1819.70 → 1822.10] But then it's not my own office, right?
[1822.48 → 1822.80] Okay.
[1822.88 → 1823.38] It is.
[1823.92 → 1824.08] What?
[1824.16 → 1824.74] I don't think it is.
[1824.76 → 1825.42] It's complicated.
[1825.70 → 1827.32] You're going to have two places to sit.
[1827.74 → 1829.02] You're going to be downstairs
[1829.02 → 1830.70] with Gary and the developers
[1830.70 → 1831.70] because...
[1831.70 → 1833.02] So who...
[1833.02 → 1833.38] How...
[1833.38 → 1834.30] Who's all...
[1834.30 → 1835.56] How big is that room?
[1835.66 → 1836.78] Like, who all is sitting in there?
[1836.82 → 1837.48] It's big. It's five people.
[1837.68 → 1838.12] Five. Okay.
[1838.26 → 1838.70] So...
[1838.70 → 1841.42] So that'll be just labs developers.
[1841.60 → 1841.72] Yeah.
[1841.76 → 1844.14] They're both on probation right now.
[1844.34 → 1846.70] But those two people plus one more?
[1846.88 → 1847.12] Okay.
[1847.12 → 1847.40] Cool.
[1847.54 → 1847.66] Yep.
[1848.58 → 1849.34] For now.
[1849.88 → 1850.24] For now.
[1850.44 → 1850.62] Sure.
[1850.82 → 1853.28] But what I like about that location
[1853.28 → 1854.96] is it's extremely central.
[1855.48 → 1856.48] You guys will be...
[1856.48 → 1858.66] There's like a stairwell right there
[1858.66 → 1859.54] to the top floor,
[1859.64 → 1861.10] which is where the LTT writing team
[1861.10 → 1861.58] is going to move.
[1861.68 → 1863.32] The LTT writers are going to move to the lab.
[1863.84 → 1866.88] And then you are just one door away
[1866.88 → 1867.64] from the lunchroom,
[1867.74 → 1868.08] which is nice.
[1868.22 → 1870.36] And then you're one other more different door
[1870.36 → 1872.08] away from the bottom office,
[1872.08 → 1872.94] which is going to be everything
[1872.94 → 1874.38] that is not LTT writing.
[1874.76 → 1877.34] So writing for every other MAC address
[1877.34 → 1879.78] and, you know, whatever circuits,
[1879.98 → 1880.86] sort of circuit or whatever.
[1881.26 → 1882.58] So that's going into lab two.
[1883.02 → 1884.46] Because that was up in the air last time.
[1884.46 → 1885.26] No, they're going to lab two.
[1885.32 → 1885.52] Okay.
[1886.22 → 1886.70] I think.
[1887.18 → 1887.36] Okay.
[1887.38 → 1887.98] Don't quote me on that.
[1888.16 → 1888.56] Okay.
[1888.76 → 1890.62] And then you'll also are actually,
[1890.62 → 1891.42] you're in like this little,
[1891.42 → 1893.00] aquarium with like windows
[1893.00 → 1895.36] and you're looking out into the shop floor
[1895.36 → 1896.30] as it is now.
[1896.32 → 1896.82] Oh, that's cool.
[1896.86 → 1897.88] But what will be the lab?
[1898.12 → 1898.96] Oh, that's really cool.
[1899.06 → 1900.56] So you're extremely central.
[1900.76 → 1902.04] And then that staircase
[1902.04 → 1903.70] right at the top of the stairs
[1903.70 → 1905.34] is a call room
[1905.34 → 1906.64] that is just yours.
[1907.16 → 1907.56] Cool.
[1907.56 → 1909.12] So you actually,
[1909.12 → 1910.06] actually most of the time
[1910.06 → 1912.62] because I'm kind of expecting you,
[1912.72 → 1913.34] this is funny.
[1913.42 → 1914.92] We're like actually having a meeting right now
[1914.92 → 1915.58] because of those things
[1915.58 → 1916.80] Luke actually does not know.
[1917.02 → 1917.14] Yeah.
[1919.30 → 1919.78] Most,
[1919.90 → 1921.50] because you're going to be guiding
[1921.50 → 1923.52] the development efforts of the lab
[1923.52 → 1924.76] where Gary's,
[1925.10 → 1927.96] I'm expecting to have sort of the vision
[1927.96 → 1929.46] for how we are collecting
[1929.46 → 1930.56] and presenting this data.
[1930.56 → 1932.04] But he has,
[1932.24 → 1932.74] to my knowledge,
[1932.86 → 1935.24] no experience managing developers whatsoever.
[1936.06 → 1936.96] So we're going to need your help.
[1936.96 → 1937.42] So far the ones that we have
[1937.42 → 1938.32] are just like fantastic
[1938.32 → 1939.50] and need very little management.
[1939.82 → 1940.00] Good.
[1941.00 → 1941.82] It's been great.
[1942.02 → 1943.26] But we will need your help.
[1943.30 → 1943.68] Yeah, yeah.
[1943.68 → 1945.76] So you're going to be there
[1945.76 → 1946.60] to be a resource
[1946.60 → 1949.88] and then the other 80% of the time
[1949.88 → 1951.04] or whatever that works out,
[1951.12 → 1952.12] you can be in your office
[1952.12 → 1953.68] and I expect you to just kind of
[1953.68 → 1956.22] ping pong between those two locations.
[1956.98 → 1957.06] Yeah.
[1957.08 → 1958.38] And as long as there's
[1958.38 → 1960.52] dual monitors on each end,
[1960.54 → 1961.26] I don't really care.
[1961.68 → 1962.76] Well, there's whatever you want
[1962.76 → 1963.48] on each end.
[1963.58 → 1963.72] Yeah.
[1963.96 → 1965.30] Like that's honestly,
[1965.30 → 1966.58] for how much you cost,
[1966.72 → 1967.94] a couple of monitors
[1967.94 → 1969.52] or laptops here and there
[1969.52 → 1972.18] is sort of a minor concern.
[1972.34 → 1972.44] I don't know.
[1972.44 → 1973.50] I got to keep using this
[1973.50 → 1975.14] with this broken in half laptop
[1975.14 → 1976.44] because he won't give me a new one.
[1976.46 → 1978.26] So this guy memes being poor
[1978.26 → 1980.18] and normally, okay,
[1980.32 → 1980.98] normally it would be
[1980.98 → 1982.42] against our HR policies
[1982.42 → 1983.54] for me to disclose
[1983.54 → 1984.54] any information
[1984.54 → 1986.06] about the earnings of an employee,
[1986.22 → 1986.78] but I feel like
[1986.78 → 1987.78] he's kind of got it coming
[1987.78 → 1988.44] at this point.
[1988.78 → 1989.64] He's not poor.
[1992.00 → 1993.26] I'm fine.
[1993.42 → 1995.18] This is a complete
[1995.18 → 1997.00] f***ING fabrication.
[1998.12 → 1999.04] This image.
[1999.88 → 2001.24] This I only wear clothes
[2001.24 → 2002.22] I get for free.
[2002.22 → 2003.24] I mean, he does.
[2003.24 → 2003.82] That's true.
[2004.00 → 2004.34] It's not.
[2004.50 → 2005.66] I'm wearing LTT underwear.
[2005.86 → 2007.08] I'd be wearing LTT socks
[2007.08 → 2008.46] if you freaking made them.
[2008.58 → 2010.00] I've been waiting for years.
[2011.50 → 2012.90] But he's not poor.
[2015.10 → 2015.74] I just,
[2015.86 → 2017.78] I don't see a ton of value
[2017.78 → 2018.68] in spending a lot of money.
[2019.08 → 2020.02] And genuinely,
[2020.34 → 2021.46] I'm bugging him,
[2021.52 → 2022.46] but my laptop is fine.
[2022.58 → 2023.30] I don't have to do
[2023.30 → 2024.42] anything complicated on it.
[2024.42 → 2025.68] I watch videos
[2025.68 → 2027.20] and I type things.
[2027.20 → 2028.20] I don't need
[2028.20 → 2030.20] like a really high performance laptop.
[2030.20 → 2030.82] It's fine.
[2031.04 → 2031.68] How do you think
[2031.68 → 2032.52] he stays rich?
[2032.60 → 2033.04] They say.
[2033.72 → 2034.22] Well,
[2034.34 → 2035.34] not by holding on
[2035.34 → 2036.48] to cash these days.
[2036.52 → 2037.46] That's for sure.
[2037.58 → 2038.80] Gotta love that inflation.
[2039.04 → 2039.16] Inflation.
[2039.16 → 2040.28] I love that it has
[2040.28 → 2041.32] the name inflation,
[2041.32 → 2042.96] but what it actually means
[2042.96 → 2044.40] is that you're buying power
[2044.40 → 2045.74] is going down.
[2045.84 → 2045.96] Yeah.
[2047.96 → 2048.82] Oh no.
[2049.00 → 2049.40] Yeah.
[2050.00 → 2050.52] Oh no.
[2050.58 → 2051.14] It's pretty,
[2051.24 → 2052.04] it's pretty rough.
[2052.22 → 2053.24] As far as I can tell,
[2053.28 → 2054.76] there's no safe haven right now.
[2055.26 → 2056.70] Gold has stayed pegged
[2056.70 → 2058.04] at a pretty consistent value
[2058.04 → 2059.20] compared to the USD.
[2060.12 → 2060.96] Crypto is like,
[2061.04 → 2062.32] stocks.
[2063.48 → 2064.24] I mean,
[2064.34 → 2064.54] what?
[2064.62 → 2065.36] Government bonds?
[2065.44 → 2066.62] I haven't looked at those recently.
[2066.86 → 2067.00] Property.
[2067.42 → 2068.00] But even then,
[2068.14 → 2069.16] government bonds
[2069.16 → 2070.52] typically only appreciate
[2070.52 → 2071.78] at a very low rate
[2071.78 → 2072.68] compared to,
[2072.96 → 2073.72] dollars.
[2074.22 → 2074.38] No,
[2074.44 → 2074.66] I mean,
[2074.74 → 2075.00] even,
[2075.26 → 2075.50] no,
[2075.80 → 2076.22] well,
[2076.34 → 2076.58] okay,
[2076.64 → 2077.54] I don't know about everywhere,
[2077.72 → 2078.38] but here in Vancouver,
[2079.06 → 2079.28] no,
[2079.34 → 2080.38] it's going down right now.
[2080.54 → 2080.94] Well,
[2081.06 → 2082.90] it's like poised for a crash.
[2083.68 → 2084.08] Finally,
[2084.28 → 2085.24] because we don't have
[2085.24 → 2086.70] zero interest rates,
[2086.74 → 2087.46] which are stupid.
[2089.32 → 2089.76] Like,
[2089.94 → 2091.40] where are you,
[2091.50 → 2092.70] where are you supposed to put it?
[2092.94 → 2093.66] I don't get it.
[2094.48 → 2095.82] Someone messaged said,
[2096.04 → 2097.74] the best cheap gaming laptop video,
[2097.86 → 2098.18] please.
[2098.40 → 2099.18] I'm super stuck.
[2099.40 → 2100.76] If you listen to what I just said,
[2100.92 → 2101.92] I wouldn't have a lot of good input
[2101.92 → 2102.94] because I don't know.
[2102.96 → 2103.64] I use it for gaming.
[2104.18 → 2104.58] Yeah.
[2104.80 → 2105.82] The only things I use it for
[2105.82 → 2106.92] is not gaming.
[2107.38 → 2108.78] So apparently there's a seven
[2108.78 → 2110.24] to nine percent bond right now.
[2110.32 → 2110.54] Okay.
[2110.58 → 2111.96] So if you want to tread water,
[2112.52 → 2112.88] apparently,
[2113.12 → 2113.96] it's not financial advice.
[2114.04 → 2114.38] We don't know.
[2114.72 → 2115.04] Yeah.
[2115.78 → 2117.64] Apparently that's potentially
[2117.64 → 2118.78] maybe an option,
[2119.00 → 2121.56] but I don't know anything about that.
[2121.68 → 2125.76] My investment is to keep dumping money
[2125.76 → 2127.08] into LMG
[2127.08 → 2128.86] and hope that that works
[2128.86 → 2132.32] because it sure isn't my house.
[2133.38 → 2133.78] Oh,
[2134.04 → 2135.48] you got to try out,
[2135.64 → 2136.40] you got to try out
[2136.40 → 2137.84] the thing that we did yesterday.
[2138.70 → 2139.10] You're,
[2139.18 → 2139.34] you're,
[2139.40 → 2140.08] you're coming over tonight,
[2140.14 → 2140.26] right?
[2140.26 → 2140.42] Yeah.
[2140.60 → 2140.86] Okay.
[2141.50 → 2142.22] So yesterday,
[2142.22 → 2143.40] I don't know where to go,
[2143.62 → 2144.78] which I don't know where you're
[2144.78 → 2146.24] actually like staying at this point.
[2146.34 → 2146.46] Oh,
[2146.52 → 2147.18] we're at the new house.
[2147.26 → 2147.44] Okay.
[2147.62 → 2147.84] Yeah.
[2147.98 → 2149.62] So this is pretty exciting,
[2149.62 → 2150.88] man.
[2150.96 → 2153.20] It was like kind of emotional
[2153.20 → 2154.66] experience for me
[2154.66 → 2157.52] because yesterday we turned on.
[2157.70 → 2159.20] Me helping you move out of your house
[2159.20 → 2160.48] was emotional experience for me.
[2160.58 → 2161.24] I can't even imagine.
[2161.30 → 2161.40] Oh,
[2161.40 → 2162.10] it's a different one.
[2162.26 → 2163.54] It's a different emotional experience.
[2163.64 → 2164.18] It was like,
[2164.32 → 2166.04] I,
[2166.10 → 2167.36] I was sitting there thinking
[2167.36 → 2168.84] I made it
[2168.84 → 2172.02] because we set up the home theatre.
[2172.70 → 2175.04] Like not finished,
[2175.16 → 2175.52] finished,
[2175.82 → 2178.46] but pretty much finished.
[2178.78 → 2181.24] And it is jaw dropping.
[2181.70 → 2182.02] I bet.
[2182.02 → 2184.86] I have never seen anything like it.
[2185.30 → 2186.20] Better than a movie theatre?
[2186.34 → 2186.46] Oh,
[2186.52 → 2188.08] movie theatre,
[2188.60 → 2189.28] please.
[2189.62 → 2190.12] Oh my.
[2191.48 → 2191.84] Yeah.
[2191.92 → 2192.20] Oh my.
[2192.62 → 2193.76] I will never set foot
[2193.76 → 2194.78] in a movie theatre again.
[2195.48 → 2197.00] There will be no reason for that.
[2197.06 → 2197.92] I'm actually so excited
[2197.92 → 2199.00] to watch Kinsman.
[2199.58 → 2200.06] I know,
[2200.12 → 2200.30] right?
[2200.38 → 2200.70] We got it.
[2200.82 → 2200.92] Yeah.
[2201.12 → 2201.44] So,
[2201.62 → 2203.36] so we both independently
[2203.36 → 2204.54] watched the first Kinsman
[2204.54 → 2205.46] on planes
[2205.46 → 2206.40] without knowing
[2206.40 → 2207.20] that we both did it.
[2207.30 → 2208.54] And then we're raving about it
[2208.54 → 2208.90] to each other
[2208.90 → 2209.68] about how cool it was.
[2209.96 → 2210.14] Yeah.
[2210.24 → 2211.18] And to be clear,
[2211.18 → 2212.50] we know they're stupid.
[2212.90 → 2213.98] We know they're stupid movies.
[2213.98 → 2214.88] It doesn't matter.
[2215.00 → 2215.62] Get over yourself.
[2215.74 → 2216.46] That's like the point.
[2216.60 → 2218.16] Mars Attacks is a stupid movie
[2218.16 → 2219.34] and it's great.
[2219.54 → 2219.74] Yeah.
[2220.30 → 2220.62] Chill.
[2220.98 → 2221.16] Yeah.
[2221.38 → 2221.74] Go ahead.
[2222.00 → 2222.82] Then we went and saw
[2222.82 → 2223.70] Kinsman 2 together
[2223.70 → 2225.44] and it was fantastic.
[2225.76 → 2226.82] And then Kinsman 3
[2226.82 → 2227.54] kind of came out.
[2228.04 → 2228.68] And I just like
[2228.68 → 2229.58] didn't notice.
[2229.70 → 2230.04] Me neither.
[2230.62 → 2231.12] There was like,
[2231.18 → 2232.26] there was a global pandemic
[2232.26 → 2233.26] and there was so much
[2233.26 → 2234.10] going on at work
[2234.10 → 2235.20] and like I was moving.
[2235.56 → 2235.66] Yeah.
[2235.96 → 2237.58] It completely whooshed me.
[2237.90 → 2238.08] So,
[2238.62 → 2239.42] we're going to watch it
[2239.42 → 2240.10] in the theatre
[2240.10 → 2241.04] and I'm actually really stoked.
[2241.10 → 2241.80] I'm super excited.
[2241.94 → 2242.32] And yes,
[2242.66 → 2243.68] we know the second one
[2243.68 → 2244.34] was even dumber.
[2245.40 → 2246.16] That's the point.
[2246.34 → 2246.84] It was awesome.
[2246.90 → 2247.08] Yeah.
[2247.16 → 2248.42] I really enjoyed it, man.
[2248.42 → 2248.62] It was great.
[2248.62 → 2249.34] When, uh,
[2249.68 → 2251.40] when freaking Elton John
[2251.40 → 2252.30] pulled up.
[2252.30 → 2252.48] I was,
[2252.58 → 2254.06] I was,
[2254.14 → 2254.76] the whole thing
[2254.76 → 2255.32] was just great.
[2255.42 → 2255.74] I don't know.
[2255.94 → 2256.64] I, I, uh,
[2256.72 → 2257.30] people,
[2257.30 → 2258.66] I remember seeing like,
[2258.72 → 2258.82] oh,
[2258.84 → 2259.84] it didn't like mature
[2259.84 → 2260.74] past the first one.
[2260.76 → 2261.00] I'm like,
[2261.40 → 2261.80] awesome.
[2262.76 → 2263.46] That's the point.
[2263.48 → 2264.50] I didn't want it to.
[2264.66 → 2266.02] There are certain kinds of movies
[2266.02 → 2267.36] where it's less about
[2267.36 → 2268.28] what you're watching
[2268.28 → 2268.92] and it's more about
[2268.92 → 2269.98] who you're watching it with.
[2270.02 → 2270.16] Like,
[2270.18 → 2270.74] I wouldn't even,
[2270.88 → 2272.22] I wouldn't even consider
[2272.22 → 2273.96] sitting down with Yvonne
[2273.96 → 2274.50] on the couch
[2274.50 → 2275.12] and being like,
[2275.48 → 2276.92] let's watch Kinsman.
[2278.12 → 2279.08] It's not that she
[2279.08 → 2279.64] can't,
[2279.74 → 2280.82] doesn't have a sense of humour
[2280.82 → 2282.06] or that she can't enjoy
[2282.06 → 2283.08] that type of humour.
[2283.40 → 2283.96] It's just,
[2284.02 → 2284.82] it's not like
[2284.82 → 2285.94] her thing
[2285.94 → 2287.62] the way that,
[2287.74 → 2288.02] you know,
[2288.06 → 2288.70] if you're just like
[2288.70 → 2289.52] bring out
[2289.52 → 2289.92] and you're like,
[2290.46 → 2291.78] let's play bro force.
[2293.02 → 2293.34] Yeah.
[2294.22 → 2294.98] Bro to our.
[2295.38 → 2297.02] Is it the first Kinsman?
[2297.12 → 2297.24] Oh,
[2297.28 → 2298.06] I don't want to get spoilers
[2298.06 → 2299.04] just in case people are hearing
[2299.04 → 2299.94] about it for the first time.
[2300.44 → 2300.80] Um,
[2301.30 → 2301.60] but yeah,
[2301.62 → 2302.36] there's like a
[2302.36 → 2303.76] there's a musical scene
[2303.76 → 2304.44] at the end of,
[2304.54 → 2305.64] I think it's the first Kinsman
[2305.64 → 2306.98] and there's all the rainbow colours.
[2307.14 → 2307.76] I'm not trying to get into
[2307.76 → 2308.40] what happens.
[2308.52 → 2308.96] I don't remember.
[2309.30 → 2309.54] Okay.
[2309.60 → 2311.64] But the first time that happens,
[2311.80 → 2312.26] it's just,
[2312.36 → 2313.32] it's just a riot,
[2313.64 → 2314.54] but I can absolutely
[2314.54 → 2315.12] understand like,
[2315.18 → 2315.30] yeah,
[2315.30 → 2316.34] if my mom was watching it,
[2316.48 → 2317.42] probably not very impressed.
[2318.52 → 2318.88] Yeah.
[2319.08 → 2319.32] Yeah.
[2319.32 → 2320.66] It's kind of gross.
[2320.82 → 2321.56] Hilarious to me.
[2322.70 → 2323.18] Um,
[2323.72 → 2324.18] oh,
[2324.30 → 2325.18] this is a good question.
[2325.34 → 2326.32] True Scott asks
[2326.32 → 2327.20] over on float plane.
[2327.44 → 2329.18] Did you get the Antiblack
[2329.18 → 2330.22] sorted for the walls
[2330.22 → 2330.94] in the theatre room?
[2331.00 → 2331.18] Okay.
[2331.22 → 2332.36] So Antiblack,
[2332.46 → 2333.06] we can't get
[2333.06 → 2334.18] because Antiblack
[2334.18 → 2335.14] is exclusively
[2335.14 → 2336.68] for scientific use
[2336.68 → 2337.20] or something.
[2337.68 → 2338.72] Or there's like
[2338.72 → 2339.66] one artist
[2339.66 → 2341.12] that's licensed
[2341.12 → 2341.80] to use it.
[2341.86 → 2342.98] It's a whole stupid thing.
[2343.04 → 2343.48] You want to go down
[2343.48 → 2344.72] a stupid rabbit hole
[2344.72 → 2346.24] and find a stupid rabbit?
[2346.70 → 2347.40] By all means,
[2347.50 → 2348.10] go research
[2348.10 → 2349.72] the whole Antiblack fiasco.
[2349.84 → 2350.04] Anyway,
[2350.20 → 2351.20] Black 3.0
[2351.20 → 2352.50] is the competitor
[2352.50 → 2353.48] to Antiblack
[2353.48 → 2355.32] that just anyone can get
[2355.32 → 2356.72] as long as you're willing
[2356.72 → 2357.30] to pay.
[2358.26 → 2359.74] And I was thinking
[2359.74 → 2360.92] we should paint
[2360.92 → 2361.82] the theatre room
[2361.82 → 2364.54] Antiblack 3.0
[2364.54 → 2365.86] because it will absorb
[2365.86 → 2366.44] the light
[2366.44 → 2367.06] that bounces
[2367.06 → 2368.44] off the white screen
[2368.44 → 2369.74] around the room
[2369.74 → 2370.62] and then back
[2370.62 → 2371.74] onto the white screen
[2371.74 → 2373.02] wrecking your contrast
[2373.02 → 2374.72] because it'll light up.
[2374.92 → 2375.64] The light
[2375.64 → 2376.70] from the bright parts
[2376.70 → 2377.18] of the scene
[2377.18 → 2377.94] will bounce around
[2377.94 → 2378.92] and hit what are supposed
[2378.92 → 2380.04] to be the dark parts
[2380.04 → 2380.62] of the scene
[2380.62 → 2382.98] ruining the perceived contrast.
[2383.54 → 2384.02] But
[2384.02 → 2386.16] all the comments
[2386.16 → 2387.04] on the moving vlog
[2387.04 → 2387.48] were like
[2387.48 → 2388.74] actually
[2388.74 → 2390.00] you just need
[2390.00 → 2390.64] to put velvet
[2390.64 → 2391.24] on the walls.
[2392.04 → 2392.50] And I was like
[2392.50 → 2393.34] oh
[2393.34 → 2394.52] duh
[2394.52 → 2395.52] that actually makes
[2395.52 → 2396.44] way more sense
[2396.44 → 2397.08] because then you're
[2397.08 → 2397.80] going to absorb
[2397.80 → 2399.28] and scatter it
[2399.28 → 2399.98] and apparently
[2399.98 → 2400.70] it's a fraction
[2400.70 → 2401.38] of the cost.
[2401.94 → 2402.54] So you just need
[2402.54 → 2403.40] to find some kind
[2403.40 → 2403.80] of adhesive
[2403.80 → 2405.02] sound stuff too.
[2405.16 → 2405.74] Yeah adhesive
[2405.74 → 2406.66] or staples
[2406.66 → 2407.30] are some of the
[2407.30 → 2407.72] common ways
[2407.72 → 2408.22] to put it up.
[2408.30 → 2408.70] One of the other
[2408.70 → 2409.32] common ways
[2409.32 → 2410.66] is to actually
[2410.66 → 2411.38] attach it
[2411.38 → 2412.46] to some kind
[2412.46 → 2413.08] of board
[2413.08 → 2414.36] that you then
[2414.36 → 2415.30] staple up
[2415.30 → 2415.96] in panels
[2415.96 → 2417.40] and you could make
[2417.40 → 2418.20] that your acoustic
[2418.20 → 2419.20] panels as well.
[2419.30 → 2419.78] So there's like
[2419.78 → 2420.70] whole guides
[2420.70 → 2421.56] for how to
[2421.56 → 2422.24] velour
[2422.24 → 2423.42] or velvet up
[2423.42 → 2424.26] your home theatre
[2424.26 → 2425.06] and I'm thinking
[2425.06 → 2426.54] maybe something
[2426.54 → 2427.42] along the lines
[2427.42 → 2429.96] of the ceiling
[2429.96 → 2430.64] maybe the whole
[2430.64 → 2431.02] thing
[2431.02 → 2432.38] and then the sides
[2432.38 → 2433.76] maybe I don't know
[2433.76 → 2434.78] four to eight feet
[2434.78 → 2435.90] would probably
[2435.90 → 2436.82] do a lot of it.
[2437.12 → 2437.68] That would probably
[2437.68 → 2438.30] get us a lot
[2438.30 → 2438.66] of the way.
[2439.28 → 2440.94] So I think
[2440.94 → 2441.40] that's going to
[2441.40 → 2442.04] be the plan
[2442.04 → 2443.56] because if we
[2443.56 → 2444.12] can do it
[2444.12 → 2444.80] for a fraction
[2444.80 → 2445.42] of the cost
[2445.42 → 2445.94] and have it
[2445.94 → 2446.56] be removable
[2446.56 → 2448.16] well that's
[2448.16 → 2448.78] pretty great.
[2448.88 → 2449.26] Then if there's
[2449.26 → 2449.68] an acoustic
[2449.68 → 2450.40] benefit to it
[2450.40 → 2450.78] as well
[2450.78 → 2451.44] then there's
[2451.44 → 2452.50] no way to
[2452.50 → 2454.54] lose at that
[2454.54 → 2454.82] point.
[2455.28 → 2455.66] That's awesome.
[2455.86 → 2456.54] It's almost like
[2456.54 → 2457.64] the DIY people
[2457.64 → 2458.70] over on forums
[2458.70 → 2460.18] like AVS
[2460.18 → 2461.30] have been doing
[2461.30 → 2462.52] this for 20
[2462.52 → 2463.20] plus years
[2463.20 → 2464.52] and already
[2464.52 → 2465.26] know how to
[2465.26 → 2465.88] do it.
[2466.70 → 2467.58] For flocking
[2467.58 → 2468.34] slash velvet
[2468.34 → 2468.82] it's called
[2468.82 → 2469.48] sizing
[2469.48 → 2470.58] not adhesive.
[2471.16 → 2471.56] Fun fact
[2471.56 → 2471.96] for the day.
[2472.08 → 2472.32] Thanks
[2472.32 → 2473.62] Ganja Gremlin
[2473.62 → 2474.90] is velvet
[2474.90 → 2476.02] not a fire hazard.
[2476.32 → 2476.58] I mean
[2476.58 → 2477.12] not if you
[2477.12 → 2477.40] spray it
[2477.40 → 2477.74] with fire
[2477.74 → 2478.20] retardant
[2478.20 → 2478.60] I guess.
[2479.34 → 2480.20] I don't know.
[2481.14 → 2481.58] Duotone
[2481.58 → 2482.06] wouldn't be
[2482.06 → 2482.58] so we could
[2482.58 → 2483.22] use duotone.
[2483.64 → 2484.02] Duotone
[2484.02 → 2484.58] is extremely
[2484.58 → 2485.22] fire-resistant
[2485.22 → 2486.94] so just line
[2486.94 → 2487.18] it with
[2487.18 → 2487.46] due.
[2487.78 → 2488.10] There.
[2488.32 → 2488.56] Done.
[2488.88 → 2489.18] Nice.
[2489.26 → 2489.62] I actually
[2489.62 → 2490.22] wonder what
[2490.22 → 2490.90] the performance
[2490.90 → 2491.28] of
[2491.28 → 2493.24] devotee
[2493.24 → 2493.72] versus
[2493.72 → 2494.96] sorry
[2494.96 → 2495.56] what did I
[2495.56 → 2496.40] just say?
[2497.44 → 2498.02] Devotee
[2498.02 → 2498.58] versus velvet?
[2499.04 → 2499.78] Versus velvet
[2499.78 → 2500.04] yeah.
[2502.00 → 2502.86] Showing results
[2502.86 → 2503.08] for
[2503.08 → 2504.38] devotee
[2504.38 → 2505.62] commando cloth
[2505.62 → 2506.20] or a
[2506.20 → 2506.78] velour.
[2506.96 → 2507.48] Look at this.
[2507.88 → 2508.30] There's whole
[2508.30 → 2508.86] articles.
[2509.26 → 2509.56] Thanks
[2509.56 → 2510.82] Charles
[2510.82 → 2514.16] charleshstuart.com
[2514.16 → 2515.28] you're leading
[2515.28 → 2515.76] edge scenic
[2515.76 → 2516.22] design and
[2516.22 → 2516.78] backdrop rental
[2516.78 → 2517.22] company for
[2517.22 → 2517.58] over 100
[2517.58 → 2517.94] years.
[2519.14 → 2519.44] Okay.
[2520.28 → 2520.84] Woven
[2520.84 → 2521.22] masking
[2521.22 → 2521.72] fabrics
[2521.72 → 2522.18] made from
[2522.18 → 2522.90] 100%
[2522.90 → 2523.40] cotton.
[2524.00 → 2524.16] A few
[2524.16 → 2524.44] subtle
[2524.44 → 2524.98] differences.
[2525.48 → 2525.64] Okay.
[2526.40 → 2527.46] Oh commando
[2527.46 → 2528.06] cloth is
[2528.06 → 2528.78] apparently better.
[2529.14 → 2529.56] There's no
[2529.56 → 2530.40] pinholes of
[2530.40 → 2530.66] light.
[2531.86 → 2532.16] Okay.
[2532.62 → 2533.02] But then if
[2533.02 → 2533.32] you have a
[2533.32 → 2533.64] little bit of
[2533.64 → 2534.08] light shine
[2534.08 → 2534.52] through the
[2534.52 → 2535.06] devotee
[2535.06 → 2536.28] that's probably
[2536.28 → 2536.64] not going to
[2536.64 → 2536.96] make it
[2536.96 → 2538.46] back through
[2538.46 → 2539.52] so probably
[2539.52 → 2539.78] fine.
[2539.78 → 2540.10] Yeah because
[2540.10 → 2541.20] you're not like
[2541.20 → 2541.88] hanging it in
[2541.88 → 2542.36] the middle of
[2542.36 → 2542.66] the room.
[2542.74 → 2542.98] You're putting
[2542.98 → 2543.40] it up against
[2543.40 → 2543.86] the wall.
[2544.12 → 2544.26] Probably
[2544.26 → 2544.94] different properties.
[2544.94 → 2545.30] Whoa.
[2545.48 → 2546.04] Commando cloth
[2546.04 → 2546.54] is more like
[2546.54 → 2547.08] jeans.
[2547.66 → 2548.52] It's double
[2548.52 → 2549.08] the weight
[2549.08 → 2550.40] with a
[2550.40 → 2551.04] 100 yard
[2551.04 → 2551.68] roll coming
[2551.68 → 2552.36] in at 100
[2552.36 → 2552.90] pounds
[2552.90 → 2553.46] compared to
[2553.46 → 2553.98] just 55.
[2553.98 → 2554.50] Jeans on
[2554.50 → 2554.88] the wall.
[2555.84 → 2556.28] Brilliant.
[2556.46 → 2556.86] Velour.
[2557.60 → 2557.92] Knit
[2557.92 → 2558.38] knapped
[2558.38 → 2558.98] fabric that's
[2558.98 → 2559.42] memorable for
[2559.42 → 2560.04] its lush
[2560.04 → 2560.62] feel.
[2561.52 → 2562.52] Very nice.
[2563.18 → 2563.78] Velour and
[2563.78 → 2564.00] velvet.
[2564.00 → 2564.26] I don't know
[2564.26 → 2564.70] if I want to
[2564.70 → 2565.38] spend time in
[2565.38 → 2566.12] the dark
[2566.28 → 2567.02] this whole
[2567.02 → 2567.82] article is just
[2567.82 → 2568.34] to tell you
[2568.34 → 2569.10] what they are
[2569.10 → 2569.94] and not to
[2569.94 → 2570.38] tell me which
[2570.38 → 2570.70] one to
[2570.70 → 2573.22] gosh darn it
[2573.22 → 2573.68] Charles H.
[2573.76 → 2573.94] Stewart.
[2574.92 → 2575.56] I'm not
[2575.56 → 2576.06] impressed.
[2576.30 → 2577.16] Not impressed.
[2577.30 → 2577.92] Not one bit.
[2579.62 → 2580.42] Oh man.
[2580.54 → 2581.08] So we'll
[2581.08 → 2581.54] figure out
[2581.54 → 2582.54] exactly what
[2582.54 → 2583.36] material but
[2583.36 → 2584.26] devotee would
[2584.26 → 2584.96] probably be
[2584.96 → 2585.30] safer.
[2586.32 → 2587.10] There's a note
[2587.10 → 2587.68] in the doc
[2587.68 → 2588.72] for a hammer
[2588.72 → 2589.62] time update.
[2590.28 → 2590.94] I don't know
[2590.94 → 2591.32] how many people
[2591.32 → 2592.22] are going to
[2592.22 → 2592.94] even know this
[2592.94 → 2593.52] story at this
[2593.52 → 2595.36] point but
[2595.36 → 2595.84] stop.
[2596.28 → 2597.52] Hammer time.
[2598.02 → 2599.80] But the
[2599.80 → 2600.74] whole
[2600.74 → 2601.76] coal bar
[2601.76 → 2602.24] hammer
[2602.24 → 2603.00] situation
[2603.00 → 2604.68] it has now
[2604.68 → 2605.60] officially been
[2605.60 → 2606.52] over a year
[2606.52 → 2607.34] because the
[2607.34 → 2607.98] last update
[2607.98 → 2608.58] was in
[2608.58 → 2609.62] April 2021
[2609.62 → 2610.60] and it's
[2610.60 → 2611.08] now May
[2611.08 → 2611.72] 2022
[2611.72 → 2613.46] and there
[2613.46 → 2613.80] has been
[2613.80 → 2614.38] no update.
[2614.94 → 2615.60] There's a
[2615.60 → 2616.92] button from
[2616.92 → 2617.64] Kickstarter now
[2617.64 → 2619.08] to anonymously
[2619.08 → 2619.68] I don't care if
[2619.68 → 2620.08] it was anonymous
[2620.08 → 2620.66] or not but
[2620.66 → 2621.70] anonymously
[2621.70 → 2622.84] request an
[2622.84 → 2623.24] update.
[2623.24 → 2623.64] I don't
[2623.64 → 2623.94] think that
[2623.94 → 2624.20] was there
[2624.20 → 2624.38] in the
[2624.38 → 2624.82] past and
[2624.82 → 2625.18] I clicked
[2625.18 → 2625.42] it.
[2625.98 → 2626.24] Do I
[2626.24 → 2626.62] think that's
[2626.62 → 2626.94] going to do
[2626.94 → 2627.34] anything?
[2627.82 → 2628.30] No.
[2630.00 → 2631.28] But hey.
[2632.00 → 2634.02] I really
[2634.02 → 2635.50] really hope
[2635.50 → 2636.42] that this
[2636.42 → 2637.30] ends with
[2637.30 → 2637.90] me receiving
[2637.90 → 2638.98] something.
[2639.30 → 2640.04] Not even
[2640.04 → 2641.02] because I
[2641.02 → 2641.70] even want it
[2641.70 → 2642.00] anymore.
[2642.02 → 2642.78] An NFT of
[2642.78 → 2643.32] a coal bar
[2643.32 → 2643.64] hammer.
[2643.78 → 2644.20] Sure.
[2644.54 → 2645.40] Just I
[2645.40 → 2646.36] just I want
[2646.36 → 2647.32] the story to
[2647.32 → 2648.56] conclude and
[2648.56 → 2649.16] as long as
[2649.16 → 2650.10] there's no like
[2650.10 → 2650.52] if it just
[2650.52 → 2651.10] goes off with
[2651.10 → 2651.74] no update
[2651.74 → 2652.26] and no item
[2652.26 → 2653.42] received then
[2653.42 → 2654.04] I'm just left
[2654.04 → 2654.58] hanging like
[2654.58 → 2655.26] what happened?
[2655.62 → 2655.72] Yeah.
[2655.80 → 2656.12] And if you
[2656.12 → 2656.68] get an NFT
[2656.68 → 2657.88] then you can
[2657.88 → 2658.40] still be like
[2658.40 → 2659.16] what happened?
[2659.26 → 2659.56] But you can
[2659.56 → 2660.16] have this sick
[2660.16 → 2661.08] bored monkey
[2661.08 → 2661.68] hammer.
[2665.78 → 2666.62] It's just a
[2666.62 → 2667.08] picture of a
[2667.08 → 2667.54] bored ape
[2667.54 → 2668.44] holding this
[2668.44 → 2669.04] like weird
[2669.04 → 2669.64] hammer.
[2670.04 → 2670.44] Dude.
[2670.72 → 2671.18] Whatever.
[2671.48 → 2671.90] At least I
[2671.90 → 2672.36] get something.
[2672.46 → 2673.02] A t-shirt with
[2673.02 → 2673.48] a picture of
[2673.48 → 2673.78] the hammer.
[2673.92 → 2674.16] Yeah.
[2674.36 → 2674.88] Like I just
[2674.88 → 2675.86] I want the
[2675.86 → 2676.62] story to end.
[2676.84 → 2677.20] That's where
[2677.20 → 2677.68] I'm at right
[2677.68 → 2677.92] now.
[2678.08 → 2678.96] I just want
[2678.96 → 2679.38] there to be
[2679.38 → 2680.22] some form
[2680.22 → 2680.76] of endings
[2680.76 → 2681.18] that I can
[2681.18 → 2681.88] have closure.
[2682.96 → 2683.66] That's about
[2683.66 → 2683.92] it.
[2685.18 → 2685.46] You want to
[2685.46 → 2685.84] talk about
[2685.84 → 2686.40] Microsoft
[2686.40 → 2687.26] patenting a
[2687.26 → 2687.70] system to
[2687.70 → 2688.42] play discs on
[2688.42 → 2689.00] consoles with
[2689.00 → 2689.44] no disc
[2689.44 → 2689.74] drive?
[2690.68 → 2691.32] I'd rather
[2691.32 → 2691.96] talk about
[2691.96 → 2692.84] how we
[2692.84 → 2693.22] should both
[2693.22 → 2693.74] feel really
[2693.74 → 2694.16] old.
[2694.82 → 2695.44] This is a
[2695.44 → 2696.06] super chat.
[2696.20 → 2697.12] Guys don't
[2697.12 → 2697.80] send super
[2697.80 → 2698.14] chats.
[2698.32 → 2698.74] We don't
[2698.74 → 2699.18] read them.
[2699.44 → 2699.84] You want to
[2699.84 → 2700.52] send merch
[2700.52 → 2701.00] messages.
[2701.52 → 2702.02] Go buy
[2702.02 → 2702.46] something on
[2702.46 → 2703.52] LTTstore.com
[2703.52 → 2704.04] and send a
[2704.04 → 2704.80] merch message.
[2705.18 → 2705.70] They'll pop up
[2705.70 → 2706.86] down here or
[2706.86 → 2707.62] our producer
[2707.62 → 2708.56] Jake Relevance
[2708.56 → 2709.38] might read
[2709.38 → 2710.00] them to us
[2710.00 → 2710.68] and they
[2710.68 → 2711.32] are the way
[2711.32 → 2711.80] to send a
[2711.80 → 2712.68] message because
[2712.68 → 2714.70] they cost the
[2714.70 → 2715.36] same but you
[2715.36 → 2715.90] actually get
[2715.90 → 2716.50] something in the
[2716.50 → 2717.12] mail when you're
[2717.12 → 2717.38] done.
[2717.96 → 2718.46] Haha it's
[2718.46 → 2718.88] amazing.
[2719.48 → 2720.10] But this is
[2720.10 → 2720.80] one that's worth
[2720.80 → 2721.20] reading.
[2721.70 → 2722.52] Matthew says
[2722.52 → 2724.04] I've been
[2724.04 → 2724.48] watching your
[2724.48 → 2724.92] show since
[2724.92 → 2725.48] freshman in
[2725.48 → 2725.94] high school
[2725.94 → 2726.80] now going
[2726.80 → 2727.20] for my
[2727.20 → 2727.76] PhD.
[2732.36 → 2733.10] It's been a
[2733.10 → 2733.50] little while.
[2733.74 → 2733.98] Ouch.
[2734.36 → 2734.78] It's been a
[2734.78 → 2735.08] little while.
[2735.08 → 2736.08] I got a
[2736.08 → 2736.46] bunch of
[2736.46 → 2736.92] tweets from
[2736.92 → 2737.42] someone talking
[2737.42 → 2737.72] about our
[2737.72 → 2738.32] first WAN
[2738.32 → 2738.68] show and
[2738.68 → 2739.02] some of the
[2739.02 → 2739.72] comments and
[2739.72 → 2740.16] predictions we
[2740.16 → 2740.66] made on it.
[2741.00 → 2741.68] It's actually
[2741.68 → 2741.98] kind of
[2741.98 → 2742.36] interesting.
[2743.12 → 2743.82] I talked
[2743.82 → 2744.56] about Apple
[2744.56 → 2746.12] abandoning Intel
[2746.12 → 2746.74] for ARM.
[2747.90 → 2748.20] Really?
[2748.50 → 2748.82] Yeah.
[2749.76 → 2750.56] You and I
[2750.56 → 2751.58] both said that
[2751.58 → 2752.66] Disney buying
[2752.66 → 2753.38] Star Wars was
[2753.38 → 2754.00] a good thing.
[2756.00 → 2757.36] There was some
[2757.36 → 2757.96] good ones.
[2758.06 → 2758.62] There was some
[2758.62 → 2759.32] bad ones.
[2759.46 → 2760.02] But it was
[2760.02 → 2760.88] interesting seeing
[2760.88 → 2761.60] what we were
[2761.60 → 2762.26] talking about
[2762.26 → 2762.76] back then.
[2762.96 → 2763.44] It was kind
[2763.44 → 2763.74] of cool.
[2763.74 → 2765.80] I rewatched
[2765.80 → 2766.20] the first
[2766.20 → 2767.04] third of
[2767.04 → 2767.62] Rogue One
[2767.62 → 2768.52] and it was
[2768.52 → 2768.84] fine.
[2771.30 → 2772.38] Rogue One is
[2772.38 → 2773.74] the best one
[2773.74 → 2774.08] that they've
[2774.08 → 2774.38] released.
[2774.66 → 2775.06] It could have
[2775.06 → 2776.76] actually been
[2776.76 → 2777.14] okay.
[2777.94 → 2778.54] And then it
[2778.54 → 2778.96] wasn't.
[2779.22 → 2779.36] Yeah.
[2779.98 → 2780.70] Pretty much.
[2781.92 → 2782.66] Alrighty then.
[2783.56 → 2784.38] We should also
[2784.38 → 2784.94] talk about our
[2784.94 → 2785.30] sponsors.
[2785.80 → 2786.86] Your reason for
[2786.86 → 2787.44] thinking that it
[2787.44 → 2787.96] was okay.
[2788.26 → 2789.52] You grabbed a
[2789.52 → 2791.46] scholastic book of
[2791.46 → 2792.84] Phantom of the
[2792.84 → 2793.52] Menace and
[2793.52 → 2793.78] you were like,
[2793.82 → 2794.32] it can't be
[2794.32 → 2795.06] better than this
[2795.06 → 2795.68] or it can't be
[2795.68 → 2796.42] worse than this.
[2796.42 → 2796.78] Oh, the Phantom
[2796.78 → 2796.96] is.
[2797.18 → 2797.36] Oh.
[2798.06 → 2798.70] Okay.
[2801.10 → 2801.62] Yeah.
[2802.46 → 2803.10] Anyway.
[2805.26 → 2805.86] Yeah.
[2806.34 → 2807.36] Origin PC.
[2807.90 → 2808.64] If you're looking
[2808.64 → 2809.52] for a thin and
[2809.52 → 2810.20] light custom
[2810.20 → 2811.04] laptop, check out
[2811.04 → 2811.96] Origin PC's new
[2811.96 → 2813.42] Eve 17S.

[2815.06 → 2815.82] millimetre thick
[2815.82 → 2816.74] laptop features an
[2816.74 → 2818.38] RTX 3080 Ti,

[2820.16 → 2822.08] QHD 240 hertz
[2822.08 → 2823.26] LED backlit
[2823.26 → 2824.50] screen, and
[2824.50 → 2825.32] you can upgrade
[2825.32 → 2825.94] it to up to an
[2825.94 → 2827.68] Intel Core i9-12900H,
[2827.82 → 2829.04] eight terabytes of
[2829.04 → 2829.94] storage, and
[2829.94 → 2831.20] 64 gigs of
[2831.20 → 2832.02] DDR5 memory.
[2832.42 → 2833.10] It's Wi-Fi 6,
[2833.20 → 2834.24] HDMI 2.1, and
[2834.24 → 2835.12] weighs just over
[2835.12 → 2836.02] five pounds.

[2928.12 → 2928.54] about it.
[2928.98 → 2929.68] But it's a secret.
[2929.78 → 2930.46] But it's a secret.
[2930.56 → 2931.30] Yes, thank you, Luke.
[2931.36 → 2931.92] That's very good.
[2932.04 → 2932.64] That's very good.
[2932.70 → 2933.10] I like it.
[2933.62 → 2934.50] Secret Lab chairs
[2934.50 → 2935.32] are engineered to

[2938.22 → 2938.60] play.
[2939.08 → 2940.36] And honestly, man,
[2940.92 → 2942.84] I'm so glad we use
[2942.84 → 2943.56] them on the WAN show
[2943.56 → 2944.32] now that we're doing
[2944.32 → 2945.46] these two, two and a
[2945.46 → 2946.68] half, sometimes three
[2946.68 → 2948.04] hour shows because
[2948.04 → 2949.36] we've had chair
[2949.36 → 2950.66] sponsors in the past
[2950.66 → 2952.64] that seemed fine
[2952.64 → 2953.88] until I had to sit
[2953.88 → 2954.94] in them for a long
[2954.94 → 2956.24] long, long time.
[2956.34 → 2957.24] And I'm like, uh-uh.
[2958.20 → 2959.50] The Titan Eve 2022
[2959.50 → 2960.98] series chair offers
[2960.98 → 2961.76] four-way lumbar
[2961.76 → 2962.88] support, comes with
[2962.88 → 2963.58] a magnetic.
[2964.38 → 2965.32] Oh, shoot.
[2965.36 → 2965.98] This is the old one
[2965.98 → 2966.54] that doesn't have the
[2966.54 → 2968.18] magnetic headrest pillow.
[2968.64 → 2969.78] Anyway, a memory foam
[2969.78 → 2970.86] magnetic pillow and
[2970.86 → 2971.38] is offered in
[2971.38 → 2972.08] different upholsteries
[2972.08 → 2973.06] like hybrid leatherette,
[2973.40 → 2974.16] soft weave fabric,
[2974.38 → 2975.34] and Napa leather.
[2975.60 → 2976.46] With up to a five-year
[2976.46 → 2977.40] extended warranty and
[2977.40 → 2978.70] 49-day return policy,
[2978.88 → 2979.66] you are covered if
[2979.66 → 2980.36] anything goes wrong.
[2980.44 → 2981.20] So head to the link in
[2981.20 → 2982.32] the video description to
[2982.32 → 2983.38] check out Secret Lab
[2983.38 → 2984.20] today.
[2986.38 → 2987.12] All right.
[2987.46 → 2988.04] What are we talking
[2988.04 → 2988.36] next?
[2988.44 → 2989.38] Should we talk Elon
[2989.38 → 2990.08] Gate continues?
[2990.26 → 2990.78] I'm going to let you
[2990.78 → 2991.42] do it this time.
[2991.52 → 2992.26] I don't want to.
[2992.40 → 2993.32] I don't want any.
[2993.48 → 2995.66] This is a zero, a zero
[2995.66 → 2996.40] hot take.
[2996.64 → 2997.70] It's so not interesting
[2997.70 → 2999.32] to me, which might not
[2999.32 → 2999.64] help.
[2999.86 → 3000.24] Oh, man.
[3000.38 → 3000.72] Anthony.
[3000.90 → 3001.06] Okay.
[3001.10 → 3002.10] Can I read Anthony's
[3002.10 → 3002.84] editorializing?
[3002.98 → 3003.80] This is not mine.
[3003.92 → 3004.86] Do you really want to?
[3005.22 → 3005.42] Yep.
[3006.00 → 3007.36] Anthony says, don't call
[3007.36 → 3008.16] it Elon Gate.
[3008.54 → 3009.46] Don't let him control
[3009.46 → 3010.34] the narrative that way.
[3010.62 → 3012.06] It's amusing, but don't.
[3012.28 → 3013.40] Call it's something lame,
[3013.62 → 3015.00] like a musky meltdown,
[3015.14 → 3016.22] because that's all he
[3016.22 → 3016.68] deserves.
[3016.82 → 3017.64] It's pretty funny.
[3019.48 → 3020.48] Man, we should make
[3020.48 → 3021.52] Anthony's new job to
[3021.52 → 3022.40] write put downs.
[3022.56 → 3023.34] Just be sassy.
[3023.44 → 3025.00] Like, yeah, I love it.
[3025.10 → 3026.68] Sassy Anthony is a pretty
[3026.68 → 3027.68] amazing Anthony.
[3028.94 → 3029.34] Yeah.
[3029.86 → 3030.66] I don't want to add,
[3030.72 → 3032.02] like, you know, more gas
[3032.02 → 3033.02] to the flames, but that
[3033.02 → 3034.34] was funny when I read it.
[3035.02 → 3035.74] I don't know.
[3035.80 → 3036.72] This is so not
[3036.72 → 3037.30] interesting to me.
[3037.52 → 3039.52] Basically, he's trying to
[3039.52 → 3040.66] potentially get out of it
[3040.66 → 3041.80] or get a discount because
[3041.80 → 3043.60] there's way more bots than
[3043.60 → 3044.20] they claimed.
[3044.56 → 3044.92] Allegedly.
[3045.40 → 3047.08] They're like, yes,
[3047.14 → 3047.54] allegedly.
[3047.80 → 3048.22] No, no, I meant
[3048.22 → 3049.62] allegedly he's trying to
[3049.62 → 3050.20] get out of it.
[3050.48 → 3051.48] I don't think he's actually
[3051.48 → 3052.84] confirmed that he's trying
[3052.84 → 3054.76] to just have peak
[3054.76 → 3056.06] buyer's remorse and
[3056.06 → 3056.74] squirm out of it.
[3056.74 → 3057.96] I think what he's saying
[3057.96 → 3059.44] and might be doing, I
[3059.44 → 3059.76] don't know.
[3059.86 → 3060.42] I don't know the guy.
[3060.88 → 3062.26] I think what he's saying
[3062.26 → 3063.40] is that he just, it
[3063.40 → 3065.40] should be cheaper because
[3065.40 → 3066.64] like what he's buying is
[3066.64 → 3067.80] not what it actually is
[3067.80 → 3068.58] because he's the one who
[3068.58 → 3069.20] made the offer.
[3069.78 → 3071.04] And if he didn't know,
[3071.04 → 3072.64] if he didn't know that
[3072.64 → 3074.36] it's all bots, then he's
[3074.36 → 3075.48] an f***ING idiot.
[3076.48 → 3077.78] So I said I wasn't going
[3077.78 → 3078.50] to have any hot tapes
[3078.50 → 3078.76] for that.
[3079.12 → 3080.50] And it's over.
[3082.30 → 3083.68] Anyone who doesn't know
[3083.68 → 3084.36] It's happened.
[3084.72 → 3086.10] Anyone who doesn't know
[3086.10 → 3087.68] Twitter is full of bots,
[3087.82 → 3088.48] like what?
[3088.48 → 3089.68] Are you at,
[3090.06 → 3090.86] has he ever opened
[3090.86 → 3091.96] one of his own tweets?
[3092.12 → 3093.64] Because I, I, from my
[3093.64 → 3095.00] experience on the platform,
[3095.20 → 3096.76] the most like batted
[3096.76 → 3097.98] responses ever go on
[3097.98 → 3098.76] his tweets because it's
[3098.76 → 3099.76] all pictures of him
[3099.76 → 3100.56] saying he's going to
[3100.56 → 3101.60] give people free crypto,
[3101.80 → 3104.20] which must work or else
[3104.20 → 3105.34] they would stop doing it.
[3105.34 → 3106.76] But it's like under
[3106.76 → 3107.88] every tweet.
[3107.88 → 3109.06] It's like, by the way,
[3109.06 → 3110.24] guys, giving away free
[3110.24 → 3111.20] crypto, click link.
[3111.26 → 3111.80] Thank you.
[3112.28 → 3113.32] From like an account
[3113.32 → 3114.14] that has this picture
[3114.14 → 3114.66] and that's it.
[3114.72 → 3115.74] That's clearly not him.
[3115.74 → 3117.20] Anyway.
[3118.16 → 3118.60] Yeah.
[3118.72 → 3119.52] So I don't know.
[3119.62 → 3120.64] That's like literally
[3120.64 → 3121.46] the whole story,
[3121.68 → 3122.84] but it's like super long.
[3123.66 → 3125.22] We can get into it more
[3125.22 → 3126.00] if you want.
[3127.16 → 3129.40] It's there's a $1 billion
[3129.40 → 3131.18] reverse termination fee,
[3131.38 → 3132.60] but they might be able
[3132.60 → 3134.26] to force him to not do
[3134.26 → 3135.94] that because he would
[3135.94 → 3137.36] have to prove that it's
[3137.36 → 3138.76] more than 5% bots.
[3138.76 → 3139.68] And how can he do that
[3139.68 → 3140.40] without having access
[3140.40 → 3140.92] to their server?
[3140.92 → 3141.92] Yeah.
[3142.08 → 3142.92] So they can
[3142.92 → 3144.16] make him close the deal
[3144.16 → 3145.34] if they get a court order.
[3146.24 → 3147.72] If is they can't,
[3147.72 → 3148.94] he definitely has to pay
[3148.94 → 3149.72] a billion dollars
[3149.72 → 3150.52] to walk away.
[3150.70 → 3151.90] But I think a big part
[3151.90 → 3152.50] of the problem
[3152.50 → 3153.18] and why they might
[3153.18 → 3153.96] want to force him
[3153.96 → 3155.12] to do it is because
[3155.12 → 3156.14] this whole fiasco
[3156.14 → 3157.76] has tanked Twitter stock
[3157.76 → 3159.30] even more than the rest
[3159.30 → 3160.26] of tech over the last
[3160.26 → 3160.72] six months,
[3160.72 → 3161.56] because tech has just
[3161.56 → 3162.20] been absolutely,
[3162.54 → 3163.42] which is like probably
[3163.42 → 3164.24] good because it was
[3164.24 → 3165.34] insanely overvalued.
[3166.70 → 3167.80] But, you know,
[3167.84 → 3169.12] like they want that price
[3169.12 → 3170.12] now, obviously,
[3170.32 → 3170.88] because it's a pretty
[3170.88 → 3171.64] freaking good deal
[3171.64 → 3171.98] for them.
[3172.18 → 3172.68] Apparently they popped
[3172.68 → 3173.92] champagne in this meeting.
[3175.04 → 3176.24] That's not in these notes,
[3176.38 → 3177.88] but I've from someone
[3177.88 → 3179.02] who works at Twitter,
[3179.56 → 3180.64] they were talking about
[3180.64 → 3181.50] how they popped champagne
[3181.50 → 3182.08] in this meeting
[3182.08 → 3182.68] because they're like,
[3182.74 → 3183.34] we got them.
[3183.98 → 3184.38] Really?
[3184.56 → 3185.24] I guess.
[3185.28 → 3185.66] I don't know.
[3185.70 → 3186.40] I don't know all the details
[3186.40 → 3187.42] because I never cared.
[3187.68 → 3188.30] I didn't know this was
[3188.30 → 3189.24] going to be in the doc.
[3189.34 → 3190.32] This is so uninteresting
[3190.32 → 3190.58] to me.
[3190.58 → 3190.90] This is hilarious.
[3191.20 → 3192.24] Excessively rich person
[3192.24 → 3193.12] might be getting screwed
[3193.12 → 3193.82] over by company
[3193.82 → 3195.02] that was excessively
[3195.02 → 3195.70] overvalued.
[3195.88 → 3198.04] Like, whatever, dude.
[3198.26 → 3199.04] I don't know.
[3199.12 → 3199.92] But it could be
[3199.92 → 3201.06] it's at the point now
[3201.06 → 3202.04] where paying the billion
[3202.04 → 3203.00] dollar penalty
[3203.00 → 3203.96] to walk away
[3203.96 → 3205.40] and then coming in
[3205.40 → 3206.36] and offering again
[3206.36 → 3208.02] would be worth it.
[3208.10 → 3209.60] Could be completely
[3209.60 → 3210.92] worth it.
[3211.08 → 3211.20] Yeah.
[3211.84 → 3213.00] If they don't force
[3213.00 → 3213.40] the buyout,
[3213.46 → 3214.48] they could sue Musk
[3214.48 → 3215.12] for damages
[3215.12 → 3215.98] capped at one billion
[3215.98 → 3216.86] or try to reach
[3216.86 → 3217.36] a settlement
[3217.36 → 3218.58] for a greater amount.
[3219.24 → 3220.22] Musk seems like
[3220.22 → 3220.88] he's gearing up
[3220.88 → 3221.92] for a fight, though.
[3222.28 → 3223.08] Tweeting on Friday
[3223.08 → 3223.72] that he is.
[3224.38 → 3225.10] This is great.
[3225.10 → 3229.44] building a hardcore
[3229.44 → 3231.30] litigation department
[3231.30 → 3232.38] where we directly
[3232.38 → 3234.02] initiate and execute
[3234.02 → 3234.94] lawsuits.
[3237.02 → 3237.62] Nice.
[3238.16 → 3238.52] Nice.
[3238.60 → 3239.76] That's hardcore, man.
[3239.76 → 3241.40] That sounds really cool.
[3241.48 → 3242.04] That's hardcore.
[3242.04 → 3242.42] And with it.
[3242.42 → 3243.16] Let's go.
[3243.58 → 3244.42] It's hardcore.
[3244.42 → 3247.22] To try to balance out
[3247.22 → 3248.76] the Elon news
[3248.76 → 3249.42] a little bit.
[3249.58 → 3249.90] Yeah.
[3250.70 → 3252.66] It sounds like
[3252.66 → 3256.32] oh, I lost the original
[3256.32 → 3257.28] link for this.
[3257.46 → 3258.08] Hold on.
[3258.92 → 3259.58] Tesla released
[3259.58 → 3261.02] all service manuals
[3261.02 → 3262.68] and wiring diagrams
[3262.68 → 3263.64] for free.
[3264.28 → 3264.60] Really?
[3264.60 → 3265.28] Yeah.
[3265.34 → 3266.62] They used to be
[3266.62 → 3267.92] really expensive.
[3268.22 → 3268.92] You could access them
[3268.92 → 3269.62] but they were like
[3269.62 → 3271.22] very oppressively expensive.
[3271.38 → 3273.28] It was $32 an hour
[3273.28 → 3275.86] or $106 a day
[3275.86 → 3278.48] or $372 a month
[3278.48 → 3281.28] or $3,188 a year.
[3281.56 → 3283.22] So documents as a service?
[3283.50 → 3284.26] Pretty much.
[3284.34 → 3285.10] That's horrible.
[3285.20 → 3285.72] And then they just
[3285.72 → 3286.96] changed the yearly price
[3286.96 → 3287.32] to $0.
[3288.36 → 3289.68] Well, that's great.
[3290.50 → 3291.14] Yeah.
[3291.14 → 3293.98] What?
[3294.02 → 3294.36] You're not going
[3294.36 → 3295.08] to applaud with me?
[3295.14 → 3295.74] You're going to leave me
[3295.74 → 3297.10] completely hanging?
[3297.26 → 3297.46] Fine.
[3297.52 → 3297.98] In that case,
[3298.04 → 3298.48] why don't we even
[3298.48 → 3299.34] need to look at you?
[3299.50 → 3299.72] Yeah.
[3299.76 → 3300.44] I'm still here,
[3300.54 → 3300.90] by the way.
[3301.26 → 3301.64] What's up?
[3301.68 → 3302.12] Zoom it.
[3302.36 → 3302.68] Zoom it.
[3302.72 → 3303.30] Get him out of here.
[3304.00 → 3305.36] I think he'd have to
[3305.36 → 3306.30] physically do it.
[3306.32 → 3307.02] No, he can do it.
[3307.14 → 3307.46] Can he?
[3307.52 → 3308.14] I believe in him.
[3308.20 → 3309.06] Oh, you could software
[3309.06 → 3309.24] it.
[3309.24 → 3310.02] You could just crop it.
[3310.04 → 3311.22] Just get closer to the screen
[3311.22 → 3312.06] and it'll be like
[3312.06 → 3312.74] it's only lining.
[3312.74 → 3313.34] Yeah, I'll work on it.
[3313.36 → 3313.54] True.
[3313.74 → 3314.34] Yeah, you could sit
[3314.34 → 3315.22] in front of the desk.
[3315.92 → 3316.56] That would work.
[3321.14 → 3324.20] I have to do your
[3324.20 → 3325.12] wait, I have to do
[3325.12 → 3325.84] your sound effects.
[3327.60 → 3328.46] Right, because I've got
[3328.46 → 3328.92] no mic up there.
[3328.92 → 3330.06] There's no mic up there.
[3331.30 → 3332.56] But yeah, that's cool,
[3332.70 → 3333.12] I guess.
[3333.26 → 3333.66] I don't know.
[3333.84 → 3334.62] What do you mean you
[3334.62 → 3334.84] guess?
[3334.88 → 3335.52] That's amazing.
[3337.58 → 3338.54] Yeah, a lot of the
[3338.54 → 3339.90] articles talking about it
[3339.90 → 3340.60] are like, we learned
[3340.60 → 3341.48] all these new things.
[3341.48 → 3342.10] And I'm like, well,
[3342.30 → 3343.86] no, because people
[3343.86 → 3345.32] still had access to it.
[3345.54 → 3346.14] It was just paid.
[3346.42 → 3347.58] So it is very cool
[3347.58 → 3348.42] that it is free
[3348.42 → 3350.32] because while for
[3350.32 → 3351.46] like a shop or
[3351.46 → 3352.64] something, 3,200
[3352.64 → 3353.36] bucks a year
[3353.36 → 3354.86] might not be that
[3354.86 → 3355.32] bad.
[3355.92 → 3356.12] I mean.
[3356.20 → 3356.50] No, it was more
[3356.50 → 3357.04] than that a year.
[3357.30 → 3358.44] 32 bucks was per day.
[3358.52 → 3359.08] No, 3,200.
[3359.48 → 3360.26] Oh, oh, oh.
[3360.26 → 3361.66] Because it was 3,188
[3361.66 → 3362.30] so I rounded up
[3362.30 → 3362.60] slightly.
[3362.92 → 3363.96] 3,200 bucks a year,
[3364.20 → 3365.06] I mean, it sucks,
[3365.28 → 3365.80] but it's not going to
[3365.80 → 3366.64] like crush your shop
[3366.64 → 3367.10] or anything.
[3368.26 → 3369.10] Unless you aren't
[3369.10 → 3370.02] servicing Teslas
[3370.02 → 3370.54] constantly.
[3370.94 → 3371.24] Yeah.
[3371.30 → 3371.70] Yeah, it might
[3371.70 → 3373.00] actually suck a lot.
[3373.46 → 3375.32] I think the best
[3375.32 → 3376.58] this is for though
[3376.58 → 3377.40] is like people who
[3377.40 → 3378.08] might be able to do
[3378.08 → 3378.48] some of these
[3378.48 → 3379.12] repair jobs at
[3379.12 → 3379.40] home.
[3380.04 → 3382.28] Because like $32
[3382.28 → 3383.20] an hour?
[3384.10 → 3384.50] Yikes.
[3385.24 → 3385.80] I don't know.
[3386.04 → 3386.62] That sucks.
[3386.92 → 3388.14] Knowing me, I would
[3388.14 → 3390.18] pay for the hour
[3390.18 → 3391.90] and then permanently
[3391.90 → 3392.44] have all the
[3392.44 → 3392.98] documentation.
[3393.44 → 3393.82] Yeah, there's
[3393.82 → 3394.40] probably a way to
[3394.40 → 3394.70] do that.
[3395.28 → 3397.26] But just providing
[3397.26 → 3398.00] it is better.
[3398.26 → 3398.94] It should be free
[3398.94 → 3400.04] and I'm really stoked
[3400.04 → 3400.64] that it is free
[3400.64 → 3401.14] and that's cool.
[3401.14 → 3401.84] I'd like to know
[3401.84 → 3402.80] what the other car
[3402.80 → 3403.90] manufacturers do.
[3404.22 → 3404.92] I think you have to
[3404.92 → 3406.06] buy those like huge
[3406.06 → 3407.04] service manuals.
[3407.04 → 3409.42] I think my
[3409.42 → 3409.94] knowledge on that
[3409.94 → 3410.76] is very old.
[3410.76 → 3411.32] Yeah, if anyone
[3411.32 → 3412.54] in the chat knows
[3412.54 → 3413.42] more, that would be
[3413.42 → 3414.20] great.
[3414.30 → 3414.80] Let us know.
[3415.20 → 3415.78] In the meantime,
[3416.30 → 3417.04] let's talk about,
[3417.30 → 3418.04] oh, we should do
[3418.04 → 3418.68] some merch messages.
[3418.94 → 3419.22] Anything else?
[3419.44 → 3420.08] Oh, nice.
[3420.24 → 3420.90] Let's do some merch
[3420.90 → 3421.26] messages.
[3421.50 → 3421.64] Awesome.
[3422.70 → 3423.64] Bell, hit us.
[3424.32 → 3425.04] From Gabriel,
[3425.60 → 3426.44] been watching for a
[3426.44 → 3427.22] while and just built
[3427.22 → 3428.02] my first PC.
[3428.54 → 3429.16] What's a decent
[3429.16 → 3430.08] priced keyboard with
[3430.08 → 3431.02] swappable switches
[3431.02 → 3432.58] and gamer RGB that'll
[3432.58 → 3433.28] make me faster?
[3433.84 → 3434.52] You know what?
[3434.58 → 3435.28] I'm going to leave
[3435.28 → 3436.20] that to the chat
[3436.20 → 3437.38] because frankly,
[3437.88 → 3439.20] swappable switches...
[3439.20 → 3439.96] Pretty much any
[3439.96 → 3440.70] mechanical keyboard
[3440.70 → 3441.56] has swappable switches
[3441.56 → 3442.86] if you try hard
[3442.86 → 3443.00] enough.
[3443.00 → 3443.62] If you try hard
[3443.62 → 3444.08] enough, yeah.
[3446.74 → 3448.04] If you want like
[3448.04 → 3449.28] quick swappable
[3449.28 → 3450.70] switches, you're
[3450.70 → 3451.36] mostly looking at
[3451.36 → 3452.22] the case that's
[3452.22 → 3452.68] involved.
[3454.52 → 3455.08] Yeah.
[3455.42 → 3456.04] Yeah, I mean,
[3456.08 → 3456.80] honestly, I haven't
[3456.80 → 3457.30] done a lot of
[3457.30 → 3458.02] keyboard shopping
[3458.02 → 3459.10] since swappable
[3459.10 → 3460.66] switches became a
[3460.66 → 3461.50] big feature that
[3461.50 → 3462.40] anyone cares about.
[3462.68 → 3464.00] So I'll let the
[3464.00 → 3464.92] chat, I'll let the
[3464.92 → 3465.88] chat kind of chat
[3465.88 → 3466.78] with you about that.
[3466.86 → 3467.56] That's also pretty
[3467.56 → 3467.98] true for me.
[3468.06 → 3468.66] There's kind of like
[3468.66 → 3470.32] a wave two of
[3470.32 → 3471.50] keyboard nerds.
[3471.52 → 3472.20] I just really just
[3472.20 → 3473.14] don't think I care
[3473.14 → 3473.98] about swappable
[3473.98 → 3474.32] switches.
[3474.46 → 3475.04] It's not the kind
[3475.04 → 3475.64] of thing that I
[3475.64 → 3478.42] would do.
[3479.06 → 3480.04] Yeah, honestly.
[3480.14 → 3481.26] I might repair,
[3481.52 → 3482.20] like I might care
[3482.20 → 3482.94] about being able to
[3482.94 → 3484.04] repair it, but I
[3484.04 → 3484.80] have the soldering
[3484.80 → 3486.30] skills to just
[3486.30 → 3487.16] solder in a new
[3487.16 → 3487.98] switch, so I don't
[3487.98 → 3489.16] need a socket for
[3489.16 → 3489.36] it.
[3489.36 → 3491.88] So I just don't
[3491.88 → 3492.32] care.
[3492.84 → 3493.50] Whatever you do,
[3493.60 → 3494.04] do not buy
[3494.04 → 3494.68] drop.com.
[3494.80 → 3495.02] Why?
[3495.98 → 3496.46] Yeah, why?
[3496.66 → 3499.02] I don't personally
[3499.02 → 3499.62] like it when
[3499.62 → 3500.36] statements like that
[3500.36 → 3501.82] are made with
[3501.82 → 3503.08] nothing qualifying
[3503.08 → 3503.32] behind it.
[3503.32 → 3503.64] I mean, they
[3503.64 → 3504.64] definitely have good
[3504.64 → 3505.04] stuff.
[3505.52 → 3506.12] Like the drop
[3506.12 → 3506.76] pandas are
[3506.76 → 3507.72] freaking amazing.
[3508.74 → 3510.26] So I don't
[3510.26 → 3510.58] know.
[3511.24 → 3511.92] Oh, my Honda
[3511.92 → 3513.40] S2000 official manual
[3513.40 → 3514.24] cost around $200
[3514.24 → 3515.74] says biz someone
[3515.74 → 3516.36] in float plane
[3516.36 → 3516.64] chat.
[3517.38 → 3517.82] All right, that's
[3517.82 → 3518.28] good to know.
[3518.28 → 3519.30] Is that a
[3519.30 → 3519.66] permanent?
[3520.36 → 3521.10] Oh, I had to
[3521.10 → 3522.12] pay PW for a
[3522.12 → 3522.66] service manual for
[3522.66 → 3522.96] my jet.
[3523.00 → 3523.48] It was $50.
[3524.78 → 3525.22] Okay.
[3525.38 → 3525.70] All right.
[3525.72 → 3526.32] So it sounds like
[3526.32 → 3527.60] Tesla was kind of
[3527.60 → 3529.18] out to lunch on
[3529.18 → 3529.68] their pricing.
[3530.10 → 3530.88] I was able to
[3530.88 → 3531.66] buy the dead tree
[3531.66 → 3532.20] versions.
[3532.32 → 3532.92] I like that.
[3533.20 → 3533.80] Of complete
[3533.80 → 3534.26] maintenance and
[3534.26 → 3535.32] technical manuals
[3535.32 → 3536.22] for my Tahoe for
[3536.22 → 3536.64] $350.
[3536.90 → 3537.72] That's in line with
[3537.72 → 3538.98] what my understanding
[3538.98 → 3539.90] was for a long
[3539.90 → 3540.24] time.
[3540.62 → 3541.04] Got it.
[3542.70 → 3543.26] Got it.
[3543.26 → 3543.60] But they're
[3543.60 → 3544.14] usually like
[3544.14 → 3544.94] genuinely like
[3544.94 → 3545.54] huge.
[3546.10 → 3546.42] Right.
[3547.48 → 3547.92] Okay.
[3549.04 → 3549.88] From Colin.
[3550.44 → 3551.18] Question for either
[3551.18 → 3551.36] of you.
[3551.44 → 3552.02] This came up after
[3552.02 → 3552.70] you'd mentioned how
[3552.70 → 3553.52] everyone here is
[3553.52 → 3554.16] world-class.
[3554.56 → 3555.10] Do you keep in
[3555.10 → 3555.66] touch with any of
[3555.66 → 3556.04] the former
[3556.04 → 3557.62] LMG employees?
[3559.26 → 3559.94] Some of them.
[3560.04 → 3560.18] Yeah.
[3560.26 → 3561.82] I mean, like you
[3561.82 → 3562.36] mentioned Mac
[3562.36 → 3562.94] specifically.
[3563.14 → 3563.74] We did a photo
[3563.74 → 3564.62] shoot with her.
[3565.76 → 3567.54] It was a couple of
[3567.54 → 3568.10] years ago now.
[3568.18 → 3568.96] It was like pre-COVID.
[3569.48 → 3570.26] But we actually
[3570.26 → 3571.22] hired her as a
[3571.22 → 3572.34] freelance photographer
[3572.34 → 3573.16] afterward.
[3574.14 → 3575.10] I'm still in touch
[3575.10 → 3576.24] with Ivan, as you
[3576.24 → 3577.54] guys know, because we
[3577.54 → 3579.66] did the charity auction
[3579.66 → 3580.44] with his GPU
[3580.44 → 3581.28] collection quite
[3581.28 → 3581.66] recently.
[3581.82 → 3583.04] He was looking to
[3583.04 → 3583.52] reach a bigger
[3583.52 → 3584.32] audience with it.
[3584.40 → 3585.68] So we agreed to
[3585.68 → 3586.64] collaborate on that.
[3587.00 → 3587.56] I was in contact
[3587.56 → 3588.28] with Burke for
[3588.28 → 3589.16] quite a while and
[3589.16 → 3590.48] we don't exactly
[3590.48 → 3591.30] talk that often
[3591.30 → 3592.16] anymore, but for no
[3592.16 → 3592.80] negative reason.
[3593.26 → 3594.02] And I still like
[3594.02 → 3594.66] follow his
[3594.66 → 3595.66] shenanigans on the
[3595.66 → 3596.32] Instagram's.
[3597.12 → 3597.58] Yeah, I don't
[3597.58 → 3597.70] know.
[3597.76 → 3598.88] I mean, it's going
[3598.88 → 3599.64] to depend, right?
[3599.76 → 3600.66] Like whenever I
[3600.66 → 3601.26] open that app
[3601.26 → 3603.22] once a half year,
[3603.50 → 3604.00] it's one of those
[3604.00 → 3604.54] things where it's
[3604.54 → 3605.52] like, you know,
[3605.56 → 3606.02] how many people
[3606.02 → 3606.58] from high school
[3606.58 → 3607.06] are you still
[3607.06 → 3607.66] in touch with?
[3607.78 → 3608.32] Yeah, we're
[3608.32 → 3608.78] at the point
[3608.78 → 3609.64] now where there's
[3609.64 → 3610.30] been it's been
[3610.30 → 3611.02] that long in
[3611.02 → 3611.96] total, like
[3611.96 → 3614.34] 75 people who
[3614.34 → 3615.30] have come and
[3615.30 → 3616.18] gone through
[3616.18 → 3618.00] here and maybe
[3618.00 → 3618.60] they're not gone
[3618.60 → 3619.26] yet, but who
[3619.26 → 3620.04] are at some
[3620.04 → 3620.48] point going to
[3620.48 → 3620.72] be gone.
[3620.80 → 3621.36] Nobody works at
[3621.36 → 3621.84] the same place
[3621.84 → 3622.46] forever, right?
[3622.86 → 3623.72] And so am I
[3623.72 → 3624.42] going to stay
[3624.42 → 3625.40] BFFs with every
[3625.40 → 3625.94] single one of
[3625.94 → 3626.10] them?
[3626.92 → 3627.28] No.
[3627.28 → 3629.44] You know,
[3629.68 → 3630.98] I'd like to,
[3631.20 → 3631.84] you know, when I
[3631.84 → 3633.24] had Taryn's exit
[3633.24 → 3634.78] meeting, I made
[3634.78 → 3635.76] it very clear that
[3635.76 → 3636.70] my intention was
[3636.70 → 3638.22] to engage in a
[3638.22 → 3639.32] collaborative manner,
[3639.60 → 3640.16] you know, post
[3640.16 → 3641.22] LEG.
[3641.80 → 3642.64] You know, I'd like
[3642.64 → 3643.60] to think that Luke
[3643.60 → 3644.26] and I would stay
[3644.26 → 3644.98] friends forever,
[3645.12 → 3645.76] even if we weren't
[3645.76 → 3646.28] working to...
[3647.88 → 3648.64] Do you need more
[3648.64 → 3649.14] laptops?
[3649.42 → 3649.94] Is that what this
[3649.94 → 3650.32] is about?
[3650.56 → 3650.70] Yeah.
[3650.70 → 3652.98] I took them all
[3652.98 → 3653.36] away.
[3654.76 → 3655.72] It removed the
[3655.72 → 3656.08] weapons.
[3659.68 → 3660.16] Yeah.
[3660.84 → 3661.32] Yeah.
[3661.50 → 3661.78] Yeah.
[3661.80 → 3662.28] I don't know.
[3662.38 → 3663.58] Like, it's tough.
[3664.40 → 3665.38] ECU55 asks, is
[3665.38 → 3665.98] John still here?
[3666.06 → 3666.62] Yeah, absolutely.
[3667.12 → 3668.18] He moved back
[3668.18 → 3668.74] home, so he's
[3668.74 → 3669.38] working remotely
[3669.38 → 3670.06] now, but yeah,
[3670.06 → 3670.72] he's still here.
[3671.02 → 3672.62] We actually have
[3672.62 → 3674.86] extremely low
[3674.86 → 3675.64] turnover, given
[3675.64 → 3676.00] that we're
[3676.00 → 3676.58] approaching our
[3676.58 → 3677.44] 10th birthday now.
[3677.44 → 3678.00] Like, I think
[3678.00 → 3679.04] we've...
[3679.04 → 3680.06] I can count on
[3680.06 → 3680.96] both hands, the
[3680.96 → 3681.72] people who we
[3681.72 → 3682.36] hired at some
[3682.36 → 3682.84] point and who
[3682.84 → 3683.36] are not still
[3683.36 → 3684.68] here, not
[3684.68 → 3685.24] including people
[3685.24 → 3685.78] who didn't make
[3685.78 → 3686.30] it through the
[3686.30 → 3686.62] three-month
[3686.62 → 3687.56] probationary period.
[3688.02 → 3688.64] There's, in
[3688.64 → 3689.52] Canada, or at
[3689.52 → 3690.04] least in BC,
[3690.32 → 3691.16] there's a three-month
[3691.16 → 3692.32] trial period where
[3692.32 → 3694.08] either party with
[3694.08 → 3695.64] no strings attached
[3695.64 → 3697.04] whatsoever can
[3697.04 → 3697.60] just say, you
[3697.60 → 3698.10] know what, this
[3698.10 → 3699.38] isn't working,
[3699.94 → 3701.44] which is really
[3701.44 → 3702.80] good because there's
[3702.80 → 3704.02] definitely been some
[3704.02 → 3704.94] square peg round
[3704.94 → 3706.16] hole situations that
[3706.16 → 3706.54] just aren't
[3706.54 → 3707.28] anybody's fault.
[3708.30 → 3708.70] Where it just,
[3708.80 → 3710.50] yeah, just, yeah,
[3710.56 → 3711.74] I'm glad, I'm
[3711.74 → 3712.32] glad this isn't
[3712.32 → 3712.88] complicated.
[3713.24 → 3713.60] Bye-bye.
[3713.84 → 3714.72] You know, it
[3714.72 → 3715.18] happens.
[3715.50 → 3716.02] It happens.
[3716.18 → 3716.58] No one's ever
[3716.58 → 3717.06] quit float
[3717.06 → 3717.26] plane.
[3717.66 → 3718.94] I'm actually very
[3718.94 → 3719.68] proud of that and
[3719.68 → 3720.44] will be very happy
[3720.44 → 3721.26] when that ends, but
[3721.26 → 3723.78] I hope when, not
[3723.78 → 3724.90] if, but when it
[3724.90 → 3725.82] does end, that it's
[3725.82 → 3726.62] on good terms.
[3727.20 → 3727.94] Yeah, I mean,
[3727.98 → 3728.98] that's a big thing
[3728.98 → 3729.82] is, like, I don't
[3729.82 → 3731.08] want any bad blood
[3731.08 → 3731.64] in my life.
[3731.70 → 3732.54] It's not worth it.
[3732.58 → 3733.22] Nobody needs that
[3733.22 → 3733.54] drama.
[3735.54 → 3736.86] From Jason,
[3736.86 → 3737.90] after so many
[3737.90 → 3738.46] years, do you
[3738.46 → 3738.96] guys ever still
[3738.96 → 3739.90] feel anxiety in
[3739.90 → 3740.20] front of the
[3740.20 → 3741.00] camera or in
[3741.00 → 3741.34] crowds?
[3743.04 → 3743.48] Crowds?
[3743.54 → 3743.96] Yeah, I mean,
[3744.02 → 3746.84] I've worked hard
[3746.84 → 3751.34] to be a like,
[3751.40 → 3752.34] a more outgoing
[3752.34 → 3754.00] person.
[3754.64 → 3755.02] Sorry, like,
[3755.12 → 3755.48] outgoing.
[3756.04 → 3756.62] Oh, sorry,
[3756.80 → 3757.82] Piper G, I just
[3757.82 → 3758.88] accidentally curated
[3758.88 → 3759.66] your thing, which
[3759.66 → 3760.40] means it won't show
[3760.40 → 3761.28] up down here, but
[3761.28 → 3761.76] you didn't really
[3761.76 → 3762.82] ask a question, so
[3762.82 → 3763.68] welcome to the
[3763.68 → 3763.86] show.
[3763.96 → 3764.20] Yeah, it's
[3764.20 → 3765.04] uncrated now.
[3765.14 → 3765.58] Thanks, Bell.
[3767.16 → 3768.06] Sorry, this is
[3768.06 → 3768.70] what happens when I
[3768.70 → 3769.38] get involved in
[3769.38 → 3770.50] comment moderation.
[3770.72 → 3771.08] What was the
[3771.08 → 3771.42] question?
[3772.54 → 3773.68] Do we still get
[3773.68 → 3774.78] anxiety in front of
[3774.78 → 3775.16] the camera?
[3775.66 → 3776.28] Oh, yeah, crowds
[3776.28 → 3777.00] aren't easy for me.
[3777.06 → 3778.00] I don't actually
[3778.00 → 3778.74] like it.
[3778.98 → 3780.42] I enjoy aspects of
[3780.42 → 3781.96] it, but when I
[3781.96 → 3782.92] spend a bunch of
[3782.92 → 3784.34] time in a group of
[3784.34 → 3786.64] people, like, when
[3786.64 → 3788.22] we get home or when
[3788.22 → 3788.96] we get to the next
[3788.96 → 3790.16] rest point, like, my
[3790.16 → 3790.72] wife doesn't even
[3790.72 → 3791.22] talk to me.
[3791.22 → 3792.56] Not because she
[3792.56 → 3793.80] doesn't want to or
[3793.80 → 3794.74] because she hates me
[3794.74 → 3795.46] or because I would
[3795.46 → 3796.56] lash out at her or
[3796.56 → 3798.10] anything like crazy, but
[3798.10 → 3799.14] just because she knows
[3799.14 → 3799.86] I'm going to need some
[3799.86 → 3801.00] decompression time because
[3801.00 → 3802.44] I just don't...
[3802.44 → 3803.32] It doesn't come
[3803.32 → 3804.26] naturally to me.
[3804.44 → 3805.16] It's one of those
[3805.16 → 3807.02] things where I was
[3807.02 → 3808.72] just a geeky guy
[3808.72 → 3810.96] first and then just
[3810.96 → 3813.46] learned slowly how to
[3813.46 → 3813.92] do this.
[3814.10 → 3814.96] Like, I...
[3814.96 → 3815.86] No, it's kind of
[3815.86 → 3816.04] funny.
[3816.16 → 3817.76] I was kind of a class
[3817.76 → 3818.60] clown, like a bit of an
[3818.60 → 3819.54] attention seeker in
[3819.54 → 3820.70] school, but I was
[3820.70 → 3821.44] never good at it.
[3821.50 → 3822.32] I never got any kind
[3822.32 → 3823.12] of good attention.
[3823.28 → 3823.80] That's new.
[3826.20 → 3827.24] I was going to say, I
[3827.24 → 3828.56] can't imagine you not
[3828.56 → 3830.44] being attention-seeking
[3830.44 → 3832.34] class clown, but then I
[3832.34 → 3833.46] do find it hilarious
[3833.46 → 3834.76] just you being really
[3834.76 → 3835.40] bad at it.
[3835.64 → 3835.88] Yeah.
[3835.92 → 3836.34] That's pretty
[3836.34 → 3836.76] entertaining.
[3836.80 → 3837.46] Yeah, like, I wasn't...
[3837.46 → 3838.12] I haven't experienced
[3838.12 → 3839.00] you in that state, but
[3839.00 → 3839.96] it's just funny to, like,
[3840.20 → 3840.68] think about.
[3840.78 → 3841.46] Yeah, and, like, people
[3841.46 → 3842.12] didn't like me.
[3842.20 → 3842.76] Like, I wasn't
[3842.76 → 3843.22] charismatic.
[3843.86 → 3844.14] Right.
[3844.32 → 3845.12] So...
[3845.12 → 3847.46] I like the crowds.
[3847.46 → 3848.46] I...
[3848.46 → 3850.08] But I get the same
[3850.08 → 3851.08] thing where afterward
[3851.08 → 3853.10] I'm, like, super
[3853.10 → 3853.52] drained.
[3853.86 → 3854.80] Like, super emotionally
[3854.80 → 3855.18] drained.
[3855.42 → 3855.58] Yeah.
[3855.64 → 3856.88] But I think just
[3856.88 → 3857.48] because of, like,
[3857.52 → 3858.28] growing up, going to
[3858.28 → 3859.08] PAX every single
[3859.08 → 3861.90] year and having the
[3861.90 → 3863.30] PAX crowd kind of grow
[3863.30 → 3864.90] around with me, because,
[3865.00 → 3865.44] like, the first time I
[3865.44 → 3865.96] went to PAX, it was,
[3866.04 → 3866.88] like, 5,000 people or
[3866.88 → 3867.08] something.
[3867.14 → 3867.36] Right.
[3867.36 → 3868.72] And these days, it's,
[3868.82 → 3869.40] like, 80 plus.
[3870.94 → 3872.34] I like the crowds when
[3872.34 → 3873.70] it's generally like-minded
[3873.70 → 3874.14] people.
[3874.14 → 3876.58] So, at events like PAX,
[3876.88 → 3878.14] at events like LTX,
[3878.20 → 3878.90] stuff like that.
[3880.48 → 3881.14] It feels...
[3882.00 → 3882.82] Yeah, I feel at home
[3882.82 → 3883.78] there for some reason.
[3884.12 → 3884.72] IEM Dallas.
[3884.84 → 3886.06] I like the crowds at IEM.
[3888.60 → 3889.08] Yeah.
[3889.40 → 3890.68] But it is definitely
[3890.68 → 3891.28] still draining.
[3891.52 → 3891.82] Camera?
[3892.02 → 3892.74] I don't think so.
[3893.86 → 3895.18] Camera can be tough,
[3895.26 → 3896.54] especially when combined
[3896.54 → 3897.32] with the crowd.
[3897.94 → 3899.04] I'd say that's the
[3899.04 → 3900.26] situation where I still
[3900.26 → 3901.06] feel it most.
[3901.22 → 3902.52] When I was on stage at
[3902.52 → 3902.60] LTD...
[3902.60 → 3903.16] Is it anxiety?
[3903.26 → 3904.10] Do you feel anxiety,
[3904.24 → 3904.34] though?
[3904.40 → 3905.42] Or is it just a lot of
[3905.42 → 3906.48] mental energy, trying to
[3906.48 → 3907.14] make sure that you're
[3907.14 → 3907.82] on the ball?
[3907.82 → 3908.70] There's definitely some
[3908.70 → 3908.98] nerves.
[3909.14 → 3910.68] Like, when I had to go
[3910.68 → 3912.02] out and do a panel,
[3912.56 → 3914.26] being broadcast live,
[3914.32 → 3916.24] while also having a live
[3916.24 → 3917.42] audience in front of me,
[3917.98 → 3918.44] the...
[3918.44 → 3919.66] Man, the live audience
[3919.66 → 3921.38] is so much fun, but
[3921.38 → 3923.78] it's also so much more
[3923.78 → 3924.96] nerve-wracking, because
[3924.96 → 3926.86] if you think something's
[3926.86 → 3928.50] going to land, and it's
[3928.50 → 3929.42] like...
[3929.42 → 3930.38] You don't want to have
[3930.38 → 3930.74] that, like...
[3930.74 → 3931.04] Silence.
[3931.24 → 3931.60] What was it?
[3931.70 → 3932.62] Jeb Bush or whatever,
[3932.74 → 3933.14] where he's like,
[3933.22 → 3933.96] please clap.
[3935.36 → 3936.18] You don't want to have
[3936.18 → 3936.74] that moment.
[3937.50 → 3938.38] Speaking of Bush
[3938.38 → 3939.60] moments, you see the
[3939.60 → 3942.00] little verbal blunder?
[3942.86 → 3943.92] Oh, yeah.
[3944.02 → 3944.54] I don't think we should
[3944.54 → 3945.48] get into that, but yeah.
[3949.26 → 3950.34] Sorry, one second.
[3951.08 → 3952.46] Hello, Freud?
[3952.46 → 3954.28] Freud, is that you?
[3954.70 → 3955.50] I just...
[3955.50 → 3956.66] Yeah, why are you
[3956.66 → 3956.86] calling...
[3956.86 → 3957.48] How'd you get this
[3957.48 → 3957.78] number?
[3958.00 → 3958.96] Sorry, sorry, I...
[3958.96 → 3959.60] Are you alive?
[3960.06 → 3961.14] Are you...
[3961.14 → 3961.96] Hello?
[3962.42 → 3963.58] Hello from beyond the
[3963.58 → 3963.84] gray?
[3964.90 → 3965.42] Saddam?
[3965.90 → 3966.80] Oh, man.
[3966.94 → 3967.28] Oh, boy.
[3969.62 → 3970.70] Anyway, next question.
[3972.32 → 3972.92] From Sydney.
[3973.30 → 3973.84] Hi, Linus.
[3973.96 → 3974.68] I'd like to challenge
[3974.68 → 3975.76] your views on game
[3975.76 → 3976.10] items.
[3976.42 → 3977.20] How's it different
[3977.20 → 3977.78] from a movie?
[3978.04 → 3978.70] You pay some money
[3978.70 → 3979.36] to look at something
[3979.36 → 3980.14] and feel emotions,
[3980.34 → 3981.32] pride, confidence,
[3981.32 → 3982.22] joy, etc.
[3982.56 → 3983.06] How are you going to
[3983.06 → 3983.60] keep it for longer
[3983.60 → 3984.14] than two hours?
[3984.24 → 3985.34] How are game items
[3985.34 → 3986.36] different from a movie?
[3990.40 → 3991.28] Luke, can I just
[3991.28 → 3992.12] remind you that this
[3992.12 → 3993.04] is a paying customer
[3993.04 → 3993.84] you're laughing at
[3993.84 → 3994.28] right now?
[3994.30 → 3995.02] I'm sorry.
[3999.14 → 4000.02] You're being kind of
[4000.02 → 4004.36] I just...
[4004.36 → 4005.84] That's just so...
[4005.84 → 4006.64] Oh, man.
[4006.88 → 4007.74] Oh, jeez.
[4007.80 → 4008.24] I mean...
[4008.24 → 4013.26] Well, you see,
[4013.60 → 4015.34] a movie is an entire
[4015.34 → 4016.82] experience worth of content
[4016.82 → 4017.70] that you have not seen
[4017.70 → 4018.68] before, and you're there
[4018.68 → 4020.88] to experience the story
[4020.88 → 4021.72] and the characters
[4021.72 → 4022.64] and the cinematic
[4022.64 → 4023.68] and all this type of stuff
[4023.68 → 4025.88] and a skin in a game
[4025.88 → 4027.38] is a slightly different
[4027.38 → 4028.44] version of the same gun
[4028.44 → 4029.04] that you've been using
[4029.04 → 4029.68] the whole time.
[4031.86 → 4033.04] They're not the same thing.
[4034.94 → 4035.90] I'd say that a skin
[4035.90 → 4036.70] in a game is more
[4036.70 → 4038.04] comparable to
[4038.04 → 4040.20] collecting things.
[4040.42 → 4040.78] Yeah.
[4040.78 → 4041.56] But at least if they're
[4041.56 → 4042.58] physical things,
[4042.70 → 4043.78] I guess they...
[4044.84 → 4045.50] I mean, honestly,
[4045.58 → 4046.38] that's not really one
[4046.38 → 4047.52] that I particularly
[4047.52 → 4048.78] get either.
[4048.78 → 4049.30] either.
[4050.26 → 4051.48] Like, just physically
[4051.48 → 4052.00] collect...
[4052.00 → 4053.68] Like, I never collected...
[4053.68 → 4054.64] I think the last time
[4054.64 → 4056.06] I collected objects
[4056.06 → 4057.64] was when I was a child.
[4057.88 → 4058.08] No.
[4058.68 → 4059.56] Okay, what did I collect?
[4059.58 → 4059.80] Wrong.
[4060.30 → 4061.64] You used to collect, like,
[4061.70 → 4063.38] you had that
[4063.38 → 4064.88] unobtained bin.
[4067.12 → 4067.60] Okay.
[4068.12 → 4069.08] That's still a collection.
[4069.18 → 4069.80] Is that a collection?
[4069.94 → 4070.96] Those are mementos.
[4071.78 → 4072.60] Like, that's not...
[4072.60 → 4073.92] That's not just collecting
[4073.92 → 4074.92] retro games
[4074.92 → 4076.42] or collecting movie posters.
[4077.04 → 4078.76] Like, I could see...
[4078.76 → 4079.80] I don't consider...
[4079.80 → 4080.60] I don't consider
[4080.60 → 4081.50] the ticket stubs
[4081.50 → 4082.84] for every, you know,
[4083.30 → 4084.40] movie you saw together
[4084.40 → 4084.96] as a couple.
[4085.06 → 4085.76] I don't consider that
[4085.76 → 4086.36] a collection.
[4086.76 → 4088.06] That's mementos.
[4088.14 → 4088.94] I'm talking, like,
[4089.56 → 4091.04] collecting collectibles.
[4091.66 → 4092.88] Like, buying
[4092.88 → 4094.40] Super Nintendo games
[4094.40 → 4095.88] that you never played
[4095.88 → 4096.48] and are probably
[4096.48 → 4097.44] never going to play
[4097.44 → 4098.72] just for the sake
[4098.72 → 4100.16] of having a collection.
[4100.32 → 4100.64] That's something
[4100.64 → 4101.20] that I've never
[4101.20 → 4101.98] really understood.
[4102.36 → 4103.16] But I could see
[4103.16 → 4104.06] how something like
[4104.06 → 4104.86] in-game skins
[4104.86 → 4106.30] could tickle
[4106.30 → 4107.26] that same bone.
[4107.26 → 4108.00] How is that...
[4108.00 → 4108.32] Bone.
[4108.32 → 4108.94] How is that the same
[4108.94 → 4109.60] as a movie?
[4109.88 → 4110.30] Well, no,
[4110.36 → 4111.24] it's nothing like a movie.
[4111.24 → 4112.48] I'm not defending that thing.
[4112.48 → 4112.82] Okay.
[4113.60 → 4113.98] Okay.
[4114.14 → 4115.28] I'm just saying...
[4115.28 → 4116.64] I'm just saying that
[4116.64 → 4118.34] I can understand
[4118.34 → 4119.14] how people
[4119.14 → 4120.48] could be into that
[4120.48 → 4122.76] but in a way
[4122.76 → 4124.08] where I don't understand
[4124.08 → 4125.18] how people are into that.
[4125.26 → 4126.08] I understand that
[4126.08 → 4127.16] people are into collectibles
[4127.16 → 4128.48] and I think that's fine.
[4128.60 → 4130.14] I think a lot of the ways
[4130.14 → 4132.18] that games
[4132.18 → 4134.42] do that type of stuff
[4134.42 → 4135.42] is very predatory.
[4135.42 → 4136.56] I think there are also
[4136.56 → 4137.26] examples where
[4137.26 → 4138.14] it's completely fine.
[4138.44 → 4139.62] I have always
[4139.62 → 4141.10] defended League of Legends
[4141.10 → 4142.52] version of
[4142.52 → 4143.18] free-to-play.
[4143.44 → 4144.54] The game is free.
[4144.98 → 4145.20] Yes.
[4145.54 → 4146.74] You can buy skins.
[4147.54 → 4147.98] Yes.
[4148.18 → 4148.44] Cool.
[4148.86 → 4149.66] They have to support
[4149.66 → 4150.54] their development somehow.
[4150.78 → 4151.02] Yes.
[4151.54 → 4152.30] You can...
[4152.30 → 4153.44] I'm pretty sure
[4153.44 → 4154.46] you can't unlock skins
[4154.46 → 4155.24] through regular play.
[4155.36 → 4156.48] I'm completely fine with that.
[4156.58 → 4156.94] Yeah, who cares?
[4156.96 → 4157.80] It's just a visual thing.
[4157.90 → 4158.90] Then just don't have skins.
[4158.96 → 4159.58] You can play
[4159.58 → 4160.52] and buy no skins
[4160.52 → 4161.08] and that means
[4161.08 → 4162.04] you can play for free
[4162.04 → 4162.94] and you can play ranked
[4162.94 → 4163.44] and you can do
[4163.44 → 4164.06] all that type of stuff.
[4164.34 → 4165.04] It makes sense to me.
[4165.04 → 4166.56] I don't like games.
[4167.78 → 4169.00] Let's think of
[4169.00 → 4170.06] some of the worst examples.
[4170.40 → 4171.26] We have a subscription
[4171.26 → 4172.18] model game
[4172.18 → 4174.42] that also has a cash shop
[4174.42 → 4176.40] that includes loot boxes
[4176.40 → 4177.54] that you have to buy
[4177.54 → 4178.58] expansions for.
[4178.84 → 4179.36] It's just like,
[4179.48 → 4180.44] oh my goodness.
[4180.60 → 4181.52] Here's the problem.
[4182.00 → 4182.60] To me,
[4183.02 → 4183.94] buying a skin
[4183.94 → 4185.32] is akin to
[4185.32 → 4186.04] buying...
[4186.90 → 4188.00] For me,
[4188.14 → 4189.02] an in-game item
[4189.02 → 4189.94] should be earned.
[4190.46 → 4191.60] If I didn't earn it,
[4191.70 → 4192.98] it has no value to me.
[4193.40 → 4194.24] It's kind of like
[4194.24 → 4195.38] buying someone else's
[4195.38 → 4196.08] bowling trophy.
[4196.76 → 4197.80] I didn't bowl
[4197.80 → 4199.04] a perfect 300 game,
[4199.42 → 4200.26] so why do I have
[4200.26 → 4200.84] this trophy?
[4201.38 → 4201.78] Someone said,
[4201.88 → 4202.08] LOL,
[4202.20 → 4202.78] so World of Warcraft,
[4202.88 → 4203.96] there's a lot more games
[4203.96 → 4204.28] than WoW
[4204.28 → 4205.10] that fit that description.
[4205.64 → 4206.10] Sorry, keep going.
[4206.64 → 4207.42] So yeah,
[4207.48 → 4208.68] I guess I'm just trying
[4208.68 → 4209.78] to differentiate.
[4210.16 → 4210.74] I'm not saying
[4210.74 → 4211.96] nothing digital
[4211.96 → 4213.50] has any value whatsoever.
[4213.94 → 4214.46] Oh, for sure.
[4214.46 → 4217.00] And to talk about
[4217.00 → 4217.50] the example
[4217.50 → 4218.34] that you just gave,
[4219.38 → 4220.84] the skin should show
[4220.84 → 4221.58] that you accomplish
[4221.58 → 4222.34] something or whatever.
[4222.40 → 4222.60] Yeah.
[4222.68 → 4224.02] I strongly agree with that.
[4224.42 → 4225.60] I also understand
[4225.60 → 4226.56] that that doesn't work
[4226.56 → 4227.12] in models
[4227.12 → 4228.48] like the League of Legends model.
[4229.26 → 4229.76] And League of Legends
[4229.76 → 4230.68] actually has that
[4230.68 → 4231.32] to a certain degree.
[4231.44 → 4233.22] If you win certain events,
[4233.44 → 4234.26] I don't remember how it works,
[4234.32 → 4234.98] I haven't played in a long time,
[4235.14 → 4236.22] but if you win certain events,
[4236.28 → 4237.50] you can get a specific skin.
[4237.50 → 4238.98] Or even just for hours played.
[4239.42 → 4239.68] Sure.
[4239.68 → 4242.90] Or like for not bailing out
[4242.90 → 4243.62] of a match
[4243.62 → 4244.80] a hundred times in a row.
[4244.96 → 4245.28] That'd be cool.
[4245.28 → 4246.08] Like rewarding
[4246.08 → 4247.40] non-toxic behaviour.
[4247.50 → 4248.00] How about that?
[4248.36 → 4249.90] There's an innovative idea for you.
[4249.90 → 4250.50] That's the reason
[4250.50 → 4251.28] why I don't like it
[4251.28 → 4253.00] when they compound models.
[4253.34 → 4254.10] Because that was something
[4254.10 → 4254.98] that I had a huge problem
[4254.98 → 4256.06] with Destiny.
[4256.68 → 4256.80] Yeah.
[4256.86 → 4258.62] Is Destiny is a game
[4258.62 → 4259.30] that you buy
[4259.30 → 4260.74] and it has expansions.
[4260.80 → 4261.16] I don't remember
[4261.16 → 4262.16] if you have to buy the expansions.
[4262.24 → 4262.48] I don't know.
[4262.48 → 4262.58] Yeah.
[4262.66 → 4262.92] Whatever.
[4263.40 → 4264.90] And then there's this cash shop
[4264.90 → 4266.56] and some of the coolest stuff,
[4266.72 → 4267.54] some of the coolest skins
[4267.54 → 4267.80] in the game,
[4267.84 → 4268.92] which I do care about,
[4269.68 → 4270.52] but I care about it
[4270.52 → 4272.84] when I accomplish something
[4272.84 → 4273.60] that gives me that.
[4273.74 → 4275.14] I don't care about it whatsoever
[4275.14 → 4276.10] if I buy it from the store.
[4276.20 → 4277.52] I have zero value in it from there.
[4277.68 → 4278.76] But there's content
[4278.76 → 4280.10] that could have been in the game
[4280.10 → 4281.02] that would have been
[4281.02 → 4282.16] unlocking these things
[4282.16 → 4283.26] that you know
[4283.26 → 4284.54] is now not in the game.
[4284.64 → 4285.62] And there's constantly
[4285.62 → 4286.82] developer testimonials
[4286.82 → 4287.14] of like,
[4287.18 → 4287.28] yeah,
[4287.30 → 4288.28] we developed this thing
[4288.28 → 4289.32] that looks really cool
[4289.32 → 4290.82] and it was for this new raid tier.
[4290.82 → 4291.94] And the original idea
[4291.94 → 4292.44] was like,
[4292.48 → 4293.38] if you beat it
[4293.38 → 4294.86] in like under this amount of time
[4294.86 → 4295.56] or you like take
[4295.56 → 4297.20] this low amount of damage
[4297.20 → 4298.08] or you whatever,
[4298.24 → 4298.42] whatever,
[4298.52 → 4298.64] whatever.
[4298.64 → 4300.28] You get this thing
[4300.28 → 4302.32] and then the business team
[4302.32 → 4303.42] was like cash shop
[4303.42 → 4305.28] and we had to take out
[4305.28 → 4306.56] these challenges,
[4306.56 → 4308.68] which is content.
[4308.90 → 4309.26] Yes.
[4309.88 → 4310.24] And like,
[4310.30 → 4312.04] I personally really,
[4312.14 → 4312.74] really like
[4312.74 → 4314.22] kind of almost odd,
[4314.98 → 4316.38] unintentionally challenging
[4316.38 → 4317.36] ways of playing games.
[4317.60 → 4319.14] Like something I used to love
[4319.14 → 4319.76] to do is like,
[4319.84 → 4319.92] oh,
[4319.92 → 4320.68] it's a shooter game,
[4320.76 → 4322.22] but it has like a crossbow.
[4322.22 → 4323.34] I'll restrict myself
[4323.34 → 4324.74] to only using the crossbow
[4324.74 → 4325.18] for fun
[4325.18 → 4326.74] or I'll try to play a game
[4326.74 → 4327.50] like non-lethal
[4327.50 → 4327.94] or whatever.
[4328.14 → 4329.00] And then there's weird
[4329.00 → 4329.70] like achievements
[4329.70 → 4331.50] or whatever you can get
[4331.50 → 4332.54] for doing those types of things.
[4332.56 → 4332.94] And I always thought
[4332.94 → 4333.54] that was really cool.
[4333.68 → 4334.94] And games have less
[4334.94 → 4335.90] of that stuff now
[4335.90 → 4336.84] because they're trying
[4336.84 → 4337.34] to sell
[4337.34 → 4338.64] the same stuff
[4338.64 → 4339.40] that you would have got
[4339.40 → 4340.72] if you just did those things.
[4342.50 → 4342.86] Sucks.
[4343.86 → 4344.76] Walker of Sky.
[4345.16 → 4345.32] Oh,
[4345.36 → 4345.74] I get it.
[4345.94 → 4346.26] It says,
[4346.34 → 4347.16] I bet Linus's take
[4347.16 → 4348.06] is something along the lines
[4348.06 → 4349.04] of if you get a physical item
[4349.04 → 4349.78] you get to keep.
[4351.62 → 4351.98] Oh,
[4352.02 → 4353.26] I don't know what you're replying to.
[4353.36 → 4354.74] So maybe this is not relevant.
[4354.86 → 4355.62] But I also think
[4355.62 → 4356.60] one difference with the movie
[4356.60 → 4358.38] is that you are theoretically,
[4358.70 → 4359.88] assuming that you buy it
[4359.88 → 4360.70] on a platform
[4360.70 → 4362.08] where it can't be taken from you
[4362.08 → 4363.86] like a physical disc,
[4364.30 → 4365.36] you have it forever.
[4365.80 → 4366.56] When that game
[4366.56 → 4367.98] inevitably shuts down
[4367.98 → 4369.04] and the developer's like,
[4369.10 → 4369.22] yeah,
[4369.24 → 4369.70] forget it.
[4370.36 → 4371.74] Or just allows it
[4371.74 → 4372.92] to go to seed
[4372.92 → 4373.80] like Valve has done
[4373.80 → 4374.74] with Team Fortress 2
[4374.74 → 4376.10] in the current bot situation.
[4377.18 → 4380.24] It loses all of its value
[4380.24 → 4382.42] and you'll never get
[4382.42 → 4383.40] any use out of it again.
[4383.50 → 4385.14] You can't hand it down
[4385.14 → 4385.70] to anyone
[4385.70 → 4387.10] assuming that they even wanted it.
[4387.44 → 4387.94] Like to be clear,
[4388.06 → 4388.90] I also don't want to
[4388.90 → 4391.00] promote just like
[4391.00 → 4392.36] acquiring stuff
[4392.36 → 4393.70] for the sake of having stuff.
[4393.78 → 4394.36] I'm not saying that
[4394.36 → 4395.70] because it's physical stuff
[4395.70 → 4396.22] it's better.
[4396.56 → 4396.64] No.
[4397.00 → 4398.64] That's not necessarily true at all.
[4398.70 → 4399.14] If anything,
[4399.28 → 4400.86] I'm trying to encourage my family
[4400.86 → 4402.34] to do far more reading
[4402.34 → 4403.04] on the Kindle
[4403.04 → 4404.78] and, you know,
[4404.82 → 4405.96] on a tablet or a phone
[4405.96 → 4407.46] and far less acquisition
[4407.46 → 4408.64] of physical books.
[4408.64 → 4409.74] Not that I don't
[4409.74 → 4410.54] personally appreciate
[4411.20 → 4412.96] the sound of the paper
[4412.96 → 4414.30] and the smell of a real book.
[4414.34 → 4415.02] I really do.
[4415.74 → 4416.00] But it,
[4416.20 → 4416.52] boy,
[4416.60 → 4417.32] do they ever take up
[4417.32 → 4418.14] a lot of space.
[4418.60 → 4419.64] It's literally
[4419.64 → 4420.46] just packing your house
[4420.46 → 4421.16] with fire starters
[4421.16 → 4421.92] at a certain point.
[4421.92 → 4422.46] So it's like,
[4422.60 → 4423.34] okay.
[4425.32 → 4426.84] This is just a perfect comment
[4426.84 → 4427.50] on Twitch chat
[4427.50 → 4428.08] which is unusual
[4428.08 → 4429.14] so I'm going to read that.
[4430.20 → 4431.04] Snowfall says,
[4431.12 → 4432.16] the problem with end game
[4432.16 → 4433.28] or late game items
[4433.28 → 4434.40] in single player games
[4434.40 → 4436.06] is you barely even use them
[4436.06 → 4436.76] then it's over.
[4437.18 → 4437.76] That is so,
[4437.90 → 4440.36] that drives me so crazy.
[4440.80 → 4441.76] Bravely Default 2,
[4441.82 → 4442.48] that was one of the things
[4442.48 → 4443.40] that bothered me so much
[4443.40 → 4444.80] is I spent the whole game
[4444.80 → 4446.02] getting to like this
[4446.02 → 4447.40] like S tier party
[4447.40 → 4449.36] and then I was like,
[4449.42 → 4449.60] wait,
[4449.72 → 4449.92] hold on,
[4449.96 → 4450.74] that was the boss fight?
[4451.78 → 4452.14] Because,
[4453.06 → 4453.66] spoiler alert,
[4454.42 → 4455.72] that particular game
[4455.72 → 4456.96] like changes,
[4457.40 → 4457.76] you know,
[4457.82 → 4458.50] plot twist,
[4458.62 → 4459.18] the bad guy
[4459.18 → 4460.14] wasn't the bad guy
[4460.14 → 4461.14] but I bet you never
[4461.14 → 4461.92] saw that one coming.
[4463.42 → 4463.78] So,
[4464.24 → 4464.86] how do I know?
[4465.06 → 4465.22] You subverted
[4465.22 → 4466.22] your expectations.
[4466.54 → 4466.70] Yeah,
[4466.78 → 4467.22] how do I,
[4467.28 → 4467.96] how do I know
[4467.96 → 4468.80] if they're gonna,
[4469.36 → 4469.96] you know,
[4470.32 → 4471.30] rug pull me again
[4471.30 → 4471.58] or not?
[4471.62 → 4472.08] I don't know.
[4472.46 → 4472.80] So I,
[4472.84 → 4473.82] so I fought the boss
[4473.82 → 4474.28] and I was like,
[4474.32 → 4474.52] oh,
[4474.68 → 4476.26] I guess the game's over now
[4476.26 → 4477.10] and I,
[4477.10 → 4477.86] like there were
[4477.86 → 4478.72] literally items
[4478.72 → 4479.64] I didn't even equip
[4479.64 → 4480.44] because I was like,
[4480.48 → 4480.62] oh,
[4480.66 → 4480.76] I,
[4480.86 → 4481.22] you know,
[4481.22 → 4481.70] might not,
[4481.88 → 4483.32] might get a chance
[4483.32 → 4483.98] to use these later.
[4484.22 → 4485.12] I somewhat agree with that.
[4485.18 → 4485.88] I somewhat don't.
[4485.96 → 4486.08] Some,
[4486.16 → 4486.88] some games do have
[4486.88 → 4487.64] replayability.
[4488.08 → 4489.52] Some games super don't
[4489.52 → 4490.36] and that's fine.
[4490.48 → 4491.42] I'm not necessarily saying
[4491.42 → 4492.10] that one is better
[4492.10 → 4492.62] than the other.
[4492.70 → 4493.14] There are some games
[4493.14 → 4494.32] that don't have replayability
[4494.32 → 4495.42] that I think are fantastic
[4495.42 → 4496.14] and there are some games
[4496.14 → 4496.48] that do.
[4496.96 → 4497.96] But for an example,
[4498.06 → 4499.80] like say Pokémon
[4499.80 → 4501.28] embraced Locke.
[4501.38 → 4501.58] Do you know
[4501.58 → 4502.44] what a Locke is?
[4503.38 → 4503.74] No.
[4504.00 → 4504.86] So Pokémon games
[4504.86 → 4505.34] are easy.
[4506.10 → 4506.70] That's fine.
[4506.70 → 4507.42] Speak for yourself.
[4507.54 → 4507.96] I found them
[4507.96 → 4508.86] extremely difficult
[4508.86 → 4510.30] when I was a child.
[4510.62 → 4510.72] Well,
[4510.84 → 4511.20] okay.
[4511.88 → 4513.16] Because the whole idea
[4513.16 → 4514.00] of a Pokémon game
[4514.00 → 4514.56] is you're learning
[4514.56 → 4515.08] counters,
[4515.20 → 4515.40] right?
[4515.98 → 4517.22] And as you play longer,
[4517.38 → 4518.70] you learn more counters.
[4519.00 → 4520.12] So they make the game
[4520.12 → 4520.40] harder,
[4520.48 → 4520.96] but ultimately
[4520.96 → 4522.50] you're going to figure out
[4522.50 → 4523.90] that water beats fire
[4523.90 → 4524.80] and whatever you're fine
[4524.80 → 4525.24] and you keep going.
[4525.24 → 4526.30] And that if you choose
[4526.30 → 4527.00] anything other than
[4527.00 → 4527.86] Bulbasaur at the start
[4527.86 → 4528.70] then you're a moron.
[4530.74 → 4531.52] Maybe this is why
[4531.52 → 4532.30] you found the game hard.
[4532.62 → 4533.16] Char are,
[4533.38 → 4533.62] no,
[4533.78 → 4535.70] Charmander is just like,
[4535.96 → 4537.30] it's such a hack.
[4537.38 → 4537.96] Why would you even,
[4538.72 → 4539.14] it's just,
[4539.20 → 4539.62] it's stupid.
[4539.72 → 4540.22] It's Squirtle?
[4542.04 → 4542.40] Gross.
[4542.40 → 4546.46] I am deeply offended.
[4546.74 → 4547.04] I know.
[4547.78 → 4548.40] But okay,
[4548.48 → 4549.46] the idea of a Locke,
[4549.52 → 4550.26] and I might screw this up
[4550.26 → 4550.96] a little bit,
[4551.04 → 4552.16] but the idea of a Locke
[4552.16 → 4552.90] is you catch
[4552.90 → 4553.98] the first Pokémon
[4553.98 → 4554.68] that you find
[4554.68 → 4555.54] in like a region
[4555.54 → 4555.90] or whatever.
[4555.90 → 4556.30] Oh my God,
[4556.36 → 4557.94] it's so fun to bother him
[4557.94 → 4558.60] about stuff like,
[4558.62 → 4559.42] like you could tell.
[4560.42 → 4561.26] Actually upset.
[4561.80 → 4562.52] Actually upset.
[4562.82 → 4563.06] Yes,
[4563.08 → 4564.08] I was a Bulbasaur kid,
[4564.14 → 4564.94] but it also just
[4564.94 → 4566.24] doesn't matter.
[4566.40 → 4567.06] That's true.
[4567.06 → 4568.80] But yeah,
[4569.02 → 4570.34] I think you can catch
[4570.34 → 4571.00] the first Pokémon
[4571.00 → 4572.00] you encounter in a region
[4572.00 → 4572.82] and then you can't catch
[4572.82 → 4573.62] another one in that region.
[4574.52 → 4575.22] Oh, really?
[4575.32 → 4576.36] So it really limits.
[4576.36 → 4577.14] So you have to catch it.
[4577.26 → 4578.06] And I believe
[4578.06 → 4579.40] if one of your Pokémon faints,
[4579.50 → 4580.06] you have to just like,
[4580.10 → 4580.50] get rid of it.
[4580.96 → 4581.48] I don't remember
[4581.48 → 4581.90] if that's a thing.
[4581.90 → 4582.18] Really?
[4582.36 → 4582.80] But it's like,
[4582.80 → 4583.72] So like hard mode.
[4583.86 → 4584.08] Yeah,
[4584.18 → 4585.06] and I could look it up
[4585.06 → 4585.72] and maybe I said
[4585.72 → 4586.28] those things wrong
[4586.28 → 4586.68] and I'm sorry,
[4586.78 → 4587.74] but there are more rules
[4587.74 → 4588.58] to it too and everything,
[4588.68 → 4589.34] but it's a way
[4589.34 → 4590.24] like harder version
[4590.24 → 4590.78] of playing the game.
[4591.08 → 4592.12] If Pokémon like,
[4592.22 → 4593.56] just embraced Locke
[4593.56 → 4595.90] as like a built-in
[4595.90 → 4596.78] difficult version
[4596.78 → 4597.46] of playing the game.
[4597.66 → 4598.38] And then if you beat
[4598.38 → 4599.24] a Locke,
[4599.34 → 4600.42] you got some like
[4600.42 → 4601.24] form of accolade,
[4601.48 → 4602.00] whether it was like
[4602.00 → 4602.78] a visual thing
[4602.78 → 4603.06] or whatever,
[4603.44 → 4604.32] like that would be
[4604.32 → 4605.64] so cool.
[4605.82 → 4606.16] That would be
[4606.16 → 4607.34] a huge value add.
[4607.96 → 4610.08] But I'm sure
[4610.08 → 4611.28] games like that
[4611.28 → 4611.96] to take it away
[4611.96 → 4612.50] from Nintendo
[4612.50 → 4613.28] and away from Pokémon
[4613.28 → 4613.78] for a second,
[4614.18 → 4614.84] games like that
[4614.84 → 4615.54] would rather just
[4615.54 → 4616.58] sell you the cosmetic
[4616.58 → 4617.78] that they could make
[4617.78 → 4618.82] for making that
[4618.82 → 4619.46] type of system,
[4619.56 → 4619.86] which would be
[4619.86 → 4620.76] a way more interesting,
[4620.90 → 4621.58] way more engaging
[4621.58 → 4622.34] and better way
[4622.34 → 4624.14] of being able
[4624.14 → 4624.68] to play the game
[4624.68 → 4625.38] if you wanted
[4625.38 → 4626.20] to play it on that level.
[4626.20 → 4627.14] Because not everyone's
[4627.14 → 4627.70] going to want to,
[4627.98 → 4628.20] like,
[4628.50 → 4629.52] not everyone goes
[4629.52 → 4630.08] and goes for the
[4630.08 → 4630.74] the hardest difficulty
[4630.74 → 4631.40] in certain games.
[4631.66 → 4632.50] There's certain game types
[4632.50 → 4633.12] that I like to play
[4633.12 → 4634.28] that I don't want to play
[4634.28 → 4635.30] at super high difficulty.
[4635.48 → 4635.96] There are other games
[4635.96 → 4636.38] where I do.
[4636.54 → 4637.28] It depends.
[4637.76 → 4637.90] Right.
[4638.04 → 4638.74] And you shouldn't have to,
[4638.86 → 4639.62] but if you do it,
[4639.64 → 4640.22] it would be cool
[4640.22 → 4641.80] if you got something for it.
[4642.08 → 4642.54] Why not?
[4643.02 → 4644.00] And I feel like a lot
[4644.00 → 4644.94] of those types of things
[4644.94 → 4646.14] are being removed from games.
[4646.28 → 4647.36] It's kind of the same thing
[4647.36 → 4647.82] where like,
[4648.52 → 4650.50] when us boomer boys
[4650.50 → 4651.20] were growing up,
[4651.32 → 4651.90] a lot of games
[4651.90 → 4652.68] had cheat codes
[4652.68 → 4653.24] that would make
[4653.24 → 4654.00] the game more fun.
[4654.00 → 4655.78] And now it's like,
[4655.84 → 4656.08] nope,
[4656.46 → 4657.14] buy the DLC
[4657.14 → 4658.26] or whatever else.
[4658.94 → 4659.32] It's like,
[4659.38 → 4659.50] oh,
[4659.70 → 4659.96] yeah,
[4660.10 → 4660.84] come on.
[4662.46 → 4663.14] Speaking of,
[4663.24 → 4663.70] oh man,
[4663.84 → 4664.40] come on.
[4665.04 → 4666.26] Microsoft patents
[4666.26 → 4666.88] a system
[4666.88 → 4667.98] to play discs
[4667.98 → 4669.34] on consoles
[4669.34 → 4670.58] with no disc drive.
[4671.22 → 4671.62] Luke,
[4671.68 → 4672.52] you want to do this one?
[4673.02 → 4674.20] It's so funny.
[4674.36 → 4674.56] Okay,
[4674.66 → 4674.92] yeah,
[4674.92 → 4676.10] I read that title
[4676.10 → 4677.80] and my immediate knee-jerk
[4677.80 → 4678.22] was like,
[4678.38 → 4678.54] what?
[4678.66 → 4679.36] That doesn't work.
[4679.52 → 4680.20] It's got to just be
[4680.20 → 4681.34] an external optical drive.
[4682.00 → 4683.26] How else is this going to happen?
[4683.92 → 4685.26] And then I start reading through it
[4685.26 → 4685.52] and I'm like,
[4685.60 → 4685.78] okay,
[4685.84 → 4686.04] okay,
[4686.06 → 4687.24] there are actually some cool things in here
[4687.24 → 4688.20] and I'll get to those in a moment.
[4688.44 → 4690.28] And I finally get to the bullet point
[4690.28 → 4690.70] that's like,
[4690.96 → 4692.24] the proposed system involves
[4692.24 → 4694.30] using an external disc drive
[4694.30 → 4696.66] to verify the Xbox game.
[4696.72 → 4696.96] It's like,
[4697.02 → 4697.24] yeah,
[4697.66 → 4698.70] of course.
[4701.08 → 4701.48] Okay,
[4701.62 → 4702.06] anyway,
[4702.18 → 4704.06] so let's actually go properly through it
[4704.06 → 4705.78] because it is somewhat interesting.
[4706.22 → 4707.48] Over the past decade,
[4707.48 → 4708.52] we've seen physical media
[4708.52 → 4709.98] become less and less prevalent
[4709.98 → 4711.10] as more consumers
[4711.10 → 4712.46] have switched to digital purchases
[4712.46 → 4713.82] or streaming services.
[4713.98 → 4714.74] That is true.
[4714.82 → 4715.78] I have some problems with that.
[4715.88 → 4716.12] Whatever.
[4716.30 → 4716.78] Let's move on
[4716.78 → 4718.68] to the point that both Microsoft
[4718.68 → 4719.96] and Sony sell a version
[4719.96 → 4720.94] of their current consoles
[4720.94 → 4722.16] with no disc drive,
[4722.48 → 4723.06] also known as,
[4723.26 → 4724.10] in this specific case,
[4724.16 → 4725.12] the Xbox Series S.
[4725.70 → 4727.06] If you decided to pick up
[4727.06 → 4728.48] an Xbox Series S,
[4728.82 → 4730.20] you'll find you have no way
[4730.20 → 4731.50] to play your Xbox One
[4731.50 → 4732.48] back catalogue
[4732.48 → 4733.34] if you have them on
[4733.34 → 4735.76] digital or physical versions.
[4737.18 → 4739.52] But in a recently discovered patent
[4739.52 → 4740.52] from 2020,
[4741.00 → 4741.68] it's not even new,
[4742.14 → 4744.08] Microsoft proposes a system
[4744.08 → 4744.72] allowing players
[4744.72 → 4746.28] to receive digital versions
[4746.28 → 4747.32] of the games
[4747.32 → 4748.16] that they bought on disc.
[4748.28 → 4749.26] So that's what's going on.
[4749.50 → 4750.64] You're like verifying
[4750.64 → 4752.42] that you have it,
[4752.56 → 4753.02] I guess.
[4753.38 → 4753.52] Yeah.
[4755.36 → 4756.32] It's unknown.
[4759.24 → 4760.56] I don't know if this goes into it
[4760.56 → 4760.84] in the notes,
[4760.90 → 4761.56] but it's unknown
[4761.56 → 4762.12] if you like,
[4762.12 → 4763.34] if the physical version
[4763.34 → 4764.82] will keep working
[4764.82 → 4765.80] fully independently.
[4766.52 → 4766.96] Right.
[4767.08 → 4767.40] Like I,
[4767.40 → 4767.98] if it did,
[4768.04 → 4768.96] you could sell that.
[4769.04 → 4770.88] Would it transfer the license
[4770.88 → 4773.08] to the digital version?
[4773.08 → 4774.50] Can you transfer it back?
[4775.04 → 4775.54] And then like,
[4775.58 → 4776.92] how does it stop
[4776.92 → 4777.80] the physical version
[4777.80 → 4778.42] from working?
[4778.96 → 4780.74] Are you sure it's 2022?
[4781.00 → 4782.30] Because it sounds like 1984.
[4782.68 → 4783.14] It's weird.
[4783.64 → 4784.76] It's just like the amount,
[4784.76 → 4785.04] like,
[4785.12 → 4787.10] do we own anything anymore?
[4787.10 → 4787.62] I'm not,
[4787.68 → 4788.74] I'm not actually sure.
[4789.08 → 4789.44] I mean,
[4789.44 → 4789.74] that's,
[4789.80 → 4791.04] that's my continued argument
[4791.04 → 4792.02] for buying stuff
[4792.02 → 4793.26] like Switch games physically.
[4793.70 → 4795.06] And I know like a lot of people
[4795.06 → 4795.52] don't want to do it
[4795.52 → 4795.92] and that's fine.
[4795.98 → 4796.42] Do whatever you want.
[4796.42 → 4796.54] Well,
[4796.54 → 4797.14] if there's anyone
[4797.14 → 4798.26] who's going to f*** you on it,
[4798.28 → 4799.10] it's going to be Nintendo.
[4799.70 → 4800.06] Yeah.
[4800.80 → 4801.16] Honestly,
[4801.26 → 4801.38] though,
[4801.44 → 4801.92] like seriously,
[4802.16 → 4803.38] that's part of my argument.
[4803.38 → 4805.12] they're terrible
[4805.12 → 4807.06] with like anything online.
[4807.16 → 4809.54] The fact that there's still no way,
[4809.64 → 4810.26] I actually,
[4811.00 → 4811.46] you know what?
[4811.48 → 4812.12] I don't even care
[4812.12 → 4813.46] because at the end of the day,
[4813.94 → 4814.88] like I was already
[4814.88 → 4816.30] really upfront with them about it.
[4817.24 → 4818.64] Nintendo reached out
[4818.64 → 4820.80] about a sponsorship engagement with us
[4820.80 → 4823.26] and my response to them was,
[4823.36 → 4824.64] I think a classic,
[4824.76 → 4826.72] a classic Linus moment
[4826.72 → 4828.62] where basically I said,
[4828.68 → 4828.92] look,
[4829.60 → 4831.06] I'm just going to read it to you
[4831.06 → 4831.82] because whatever,
[4831.90 → 4832.50] it's my email.
[4832.50 → 4833.44] I can read it if I want.
[4834.14 → 4835.28] I should start by saying
[4835.28 → 4836.64] I'm a lifelong Nintendo user.
[4836.86 → 4837.32] Breath of the Wild
[4837.32 → 4838.88] is probably my all-time favourite game
[4838.88 → 4839.68] and my Switch OLED
[4839.68 → 4841.32] is currently the only modern console
[4841.32 → 4841.86] in my house.
[4842.24 → 4843.54] I'm not a fan of anything.
[4844.10 → 4845.10] I do love the product
[4845.10 → 4846.18] and Nintendo's unique approach
[4846.18 → 4846.58] to gaming
[4846.58 → 4847.54] that has made their content
[4847.54 → 4848.24] fresh and innovative
[4848.24 → 4849.20] for my whole life.
[4849.76 → 4850.50] The Wii is the only
[4850.50 → 4851.60] consumer electronics device
[4851.60 → 4852.42] I've ever camped overnight
[4852.42 → 4853.38] to buy on release day.
[4853.54 → 4854.58] These are all things
[4854.58 → 4855.20] that are true.
[4855.36 → 4855.68] However,
[4856.14 → 4857.28] this is bolded,
[4857.80 → 4858.24] underlined,
[4858.42 → 4859.40] and italicized.
[4860.06 → 4860.42] However.
[4861.56 → 4861.96] Yeah,
[4861.96 → 4862.48] it is.
[4863.54 → 4864.58] When it comes to engaging
[4864.58 → 4865.24] as a business,
[4865.42 → 4866.64] I have some serious problems
[4866.64 → 4867.60] with some of Nintendo's
[4867.60 → 4868.58] anti-consumer policies
[4868.58 → 4869.14] and practices.
[4869.80 → 4870.60] Depending on the messaging,
[4870.70 → 4871.38] I could still be open
[4871.38 → 4872.08] to working together,
[4872.20 → 4873.14] but you guys should understand
[4873.14 → 4873.80] that it won't change
[4873.80 → 4874.60] how I feel about some
[4874.60 → 4875.42] of Nintendo's past
[4875.42 → 4876.12] and present behaviour
[4876.12 → 4877.28] and that it won't change
[4877.28 → 4877.92] how I talk about it
[4877.92 → 4878.50] to our audience.
[4879.00 → 4879.74] One easy example
[4879.74 → 4880.96] is how blatantly Nintendo
[4880.96 → 4881.76] bullies customers
[4881.76 → 4883.14] into paying for Nintendo online
[4883.14 → 4884.20] to back up save files
[4884.20 → 4885.46] when it could just as easily
[4885.46 → 4886.62] be done to an SD card,
[4886.72 → 4887.76] requiring no cloud save
[4887.76 → 4889.12] and no monthly fee.
[4889.80 → 4890.50] The ideal outcome
[4890.50 → 4891.38] of these conversations
[4891.38 → 4892.18] I have with you
[4892.18 → 4893.10] is that it reaches
[4893.10 → 4894.08] the ears of Nintendo's
[4894.08 → 4895.28] executives who see the light
[4895.28 → 4896.38] and realize that part
[4896.38 → 4897.34] of meeting the competition,
[4897.86 → 4898.86] I'm assuming this is about
[4898.86 → 4899.46] getting out ahead
[4899.46 → 4900.20] of wide availability
[4900.20 → 4900.92] of the Steam Deck,
[4901.32 → 4901.76] head on,
[4902.14 → 4902.84] is shifting
[4902.84 → 4904.18] to a more consumer-centric
[4904.18 → 4904.70] approach.
[4905.38 → 4906.72] Marketing may not be enough.
[4907.42 → 4908.24] The more likely outcome
[4908.24 → 4909.10] is none of these changes
[4909.10 → 4910.14] and you guys may be stuck
[4910.14 → 4910.94] in an awkward position
[4910.94 → 4911.56] where one minute
[4911.56 → 4912.62] I'm partnered with Nintendo,
[4912.80 → 4913.98] sharing co-developed messaging,
[4914.30 → 4915.00] and the next minute
[4915.00 → 4915.48] you're explaining
[4915.48 → 4916.22] to some executive
[4916.22 → 4917.48] that I'm expressing
[4917.48 → 4918.40] frustration bordering
[4918.40 → 4918.98] on anger
[4918.98 → 4919.94] that Super Mario Party
[4919.94 → 4921.52] for Switch never got patched
[4921.52 → 4922.34] to make the board game
[4922.34 → 4922.90] mode playable.
[4923.28 → 4924.44] No, I don't consider it
[4924.44 → 4925.58] playable if you can't
[4925.58 → 4927.20] skip the tutorial crap.
[4929.84 → 4930.60] Cede and Colton
[4930.60 → 4931.38] from my business team
[4931.38 → 4932.00] just want to make sure
[4932.00 → 4932.96] you've got full transparency
[4932.96 → 4933.92] about how we work here.
[4934.26 → 4935.04] Our audience values
[4935.04 → 4935.72] our authenticity,
[4936.00 → 4936.54] which is why you're
[4936.54 → 4937.24] knocking on our door.
[4937.50 → 4938.14] You've just got to know
[4938.14 → 4938.70] up front,
[4939.44 → 4940.42] whoop, my phone went
[4940.42 → 4940.96] to sleep,
[4941.10 → 4941.86] that we won't compromise
[4941.86 → 4942.52] that authenticity
[4942.52 → 4943.40] for any brand
[4943.40 → 4944.20] or any deal.
[4944.20 → 4949.44] I forget how we
[4949.44 → 4950.52] started this conversation.
[4951.32 → 4952.06] Oh, we were talking
[4952.06 → 4953.26] about how I'm an advocate
[4953.26 → 4954.00] for buying physical
[4954.00 → 4954.44] Switch games.
[4954.48 → 4955.64] Right, and I was saying
[4955.64 → 4956.68] they don't even allow you
[4956.68 → 4958.00] to back up your save files.
[4958.12 → 4959.08] The fact that this is
[4959.08 → 4960.14] a portable device
[4960.14 → 4961.16] that you must pay
[4961.16 → 4962.18] an online fee
[4962.18 → 4964.10] to retain save data for
[4964.10 → 4966.16] should be illegal
[4966.16 → 4967.30] in my opinion.
[4967.34 → 4967.78] It's crazy.
[4968.10 → 4969.08] It's insane
[4969.08 → 4970.22] that as consumers
[4970.22 → 4971.18] we accept this.
[4971.78 → 4972.00] Yep.
[4972.00 → 4974.90] And you can resell
[4974.90 → 4975.78] your physical games.
[4976.34 → 4978.18] We'll see if they decide
[4978.18 → 4979.12] to engage with us.
[4979.20 → 4980.46] I think it might show
[4980.46 → 4982.34] a step towards
[4982.34 → 4983.26] a greater degree
[4983.26 → 4984.18] of maturity.
[4985.58 → 4987.12] But like I said
[4987.12 → 4987.60] in the email,
[4987.72 → 4988.26] what I suspect
[4988.26 → 4989.36] is that they will
[4989.36 → 4991.02] see this bulk
[4991.02 → 4992.86] and go work
[4992.86 → 4993.46] with someone else.
[4993.62 → 4994.36] I don't know
[4994.36 → 4994.98] if they've responded.
[4995.18 → 4995.84] How long ago
[4995.84 → 4996.50] did you send that?
[4996.74 → 4997.26] I don't remember.
[4997.40 → 4998.26] I shifted it over
[4998.26 → 4998.68] to Colton
[4998.68 → 4999.18] and then I haven't
[4999.18 → 4999.90] thought about it since.
[5000.04 → 5000.28] Got it.
[5000.28 → 5001.96] It's not my problem,
[5002.08 → 5002.20] right?
[5002.24 → 5003.28] It's one of those things
[5003.28 → 5004.10] where I understand
[5004.10 → 5005.04] the kind of traditional
[5005.04 → 5006.38] company that Nintendo is
[5006.38 → 5009.24] and there are types
[5009.24 → 5009.74] of companies,
[5009.86 → 5010.00] right?
[5010.06 → 5011.12] You get a feel
[5011.12 → 5011.76] for these things
[5011.76 → 5012.50] after a certain amount
[5012.50 → 5012.76] of time.
[5012.82 → 5013.48] You know how they work
[5013.48 → 5014.84] and there are types
[5014.84 → 5015.40] of companies
[5015.40 → 5016.42] where they actually
[5016.42 → 5017.44] don't understand
[5017.44 → 5019.36] that a sponsorship
[5019.36 → 5020.18] one time
[5020.18 → 5020.76] doesn't mean
[5020.76 → 5021.72] that they own you.
[5021.96 → 5022.16] Yeah.
[5022.88 → 5023.50] You know?
[5023.68 → 5023.92] Yeah.
[5023.92 → 5026.18] It doesn't mean
[5026.18 → 5026.82] that you're just
[5026.82 → 5028.00] going to,
[5028.00 → 5028.84] you know,
[5029.04 → 5029.68] fillet them
[5029.68 → 5030.88] about everything.
[5031.10 → 5031.14] Like,
[5031.24 → 5032.12] it doesn't...
[5032.12 → 5032.98] Not the best time
[5032.98 → 5033.60] to go for a drink
[5033.60 → 5033.88] of water.
[5034.02 → 5034.20] Yeah,
[5034.28 → 5035.14] it doesn't work
[5035.14 → 5035.56] that...
[5035.56 → 5035.76] Yeah,
[5035.88 → 5036.52] the memes.
[5036.68 → 5037.02] The memes.
[5037.44 → 5038.04] I couldn't help
[5038.04 → 5038.64] noticing that's
[5038.64 → 5039.30] eggplant coloured.
[5039.54 → 5039.76] Ah.
[5042.76 → 5044.12] And I just...
[5044.12 → 5045.40] I get the vibe
[5045.40 → 5046.78] that there's
[5046.78 → 5047.38] a certain
[5047.38 → 5049.42] company culture
[5049.42 → 5051.90] at Nintendo
[5051.90 → 5053.58] where there's
[5053.58 → 5055.04] certain aspects,
[5055.20 → 5055.48] there's certain
[5055.48 → 5056.42] parts of the company
[5056.42 → 5056.96] and you have to
[5056.96 → 5057.24] understand,
[5057.38 → 5057.88] every company
[5057.88 → 5058.40] is made up
[5058.40 → 5059.66] of many people,
[5059.78 → 5060.00] dozens,
[5060.16 → 5060.34] hundreds,
[5060.50 → 5060.72] thousands,
[5060.94 → 5061.86] tens of thousands
[5061.86 → 5061.90] of people.
[5061.90 → 5062.52] Varying opinions,
[5062.66 → 5063.24] varying stances.
[5063.46 → 5064.38] They're all individuals,
[5064.52 → 5064.70] right?
[5065.08 → 5066.34] But there's a certain
[5066.34 → 5066.82] kind of,
[5066.90 → 5067.06] like,
[5067.20 → 5068.30] you can smell
[5068.30 → 5069.86] an NVIDIA employee
[5069.86 → 5071.18] from a mile away.
[5071.28 → 5071.90] They just are...
[5071.90 → 5073.06] They have a type,
[5073.14 → 5073.34] right?
[5073.72 → 5074.88] And a lot of that
[5074.88 → 5076.30] comes from the top down
[5076.30 → 5078.18] and I'd like to think
[5078.18 → 5079.02] we have a company
[5079.02 → 5079.76] culture here.
[5079.84 → 5080.40] I'd like to think
[5080.40 → 5081.56] it's a pretty positive one.
[5082.22 → 5082.62] But,
[5083.26 → 5083.58] you know,
[5083.62 → 5084.26] certain companies,
[5084.38 → 5085.12] you get the vibe
[5085.12 → 5087.32] that if they sponsor you,
[5087.62 → 5088.32] they're going to have
[5088.32 → 5089.18] this sort of
[5089.18 → 5089.92] misunderstanding
[5089.92 → 5091.50] and it's going to create
[5091.50 → 5092.30] a bunch of drama
[5092.30 → 5093.40] and a bunch of strife
[5093.40 → 5094.16] and a bunch of
[5094.16 → 5095.36] problems in my life
[5095.36 → 5096.10] that I just don't feel
[5096.10 → 5096.62] like having.
[5097.14 → 5098.10] And if they're not down
[5098.10 → 5099.12] for the way that we work,
[5099.20 → 5100.94] then I just want to make sure
[5100.94 → 5101.94] it's real clear up front
[5101.94 → 5102.82] that,
[5102.90 → 5104.22] you know,
[5104.26 → 5105.44] you're not going to like it then.
[5105.76 → 5107.14] So you might as well
[5107.14 → 5108.02] just take your money elsewhere.
[5108.02 → 5109.72] Go work with somebody else.
[5111.98 → 5112.34] Um,
[5112.66 → 5113.00] all right.
[5113.06 → 5113.84] What are we talking about?
[5114.96 → 5115.28] Uh,
[5115.32 → 5116.02] either more...
[5117.04 → 5117.80] Is there anything else
[5117.80 → 5118.58] to like...
[5118.58 → 5119.30] YouTube is highlighting
[5119.30 → 5120.26] the most replayed parts
[5120.26 → 5120.62] of videos.
[5120.72 → 5121.74] I can't say I care too much
[5121.74 → 5122.28] about this one,
[5122.34 → 5123.28] but you chose it
[5123.28 → 5124.12] as a main topic,
[5124.26 → 5124.90] so...
[5124.90 → 5125.40] I mean,
[5125.52 → 5126.38] how many topics
[5126.38 → 5127.50] were in the doc this week?
[5127.60 → 5127.92] Six.
[5128.82 → 5130.10] We have to call out four.
[5130.78 → 5131.14] Okay,
[5131.24 → 5131.80] that's true.
[5131.94 → 5132.64] That is sort of
[5132.64 → 5133.78] the routine.
[5133.78 → 5136.74] I usually get stuck
[5136.74 → 5137.78] with the last two.
[5138.12 → 5138.68] That's true.
[5139.26 → 5140.88] That's one of the alpha moves
[5140.88 → 5141.52] that I pull
[5141.52 → 5143.06] just to f*** with this guy.
[5143.68 → 5144.42] It's great.
[5144.86 → 5145.20] It's...
[5145.20 → 5146.36] He leaves me with nothing
[5146.36 → 5147.36] and then one of the topics
[5147.36 → 5147.98] that I pick out
[5147.98 → 5148.72] out of nothing,
[5148.84 → 5149.16] he's like,
[5149.22 → 5150.12] why did you pick that one?
[5150.12 → 5150.38] I'm like,
[5150.48 → 5152.32] what else is there, bro?
[5153.16 → 5154.12] Come on.
[5154.66 → 5155.10] Anyway,
[5155.52 → 5155.94] um,
[5156.00 → 5156.68] I thought there was
[5156.68 → 5157.98] maybe some interesting takes.
[5158.18 → 5158.38] I,
[5158.44 → 5159.14] I can,
[5159.34 → 5160.10] I have concerns
[5160.10 → 5161.02] about how this will affect
[5161.02 → 5161.56] watch time.
[5162.34 → 5162.64] Uh,
[5162.64 → 5163.56] I think this could hurt
[5163.56 → 5164.62] watch time for sure.
[5164.84 → 5165.10] I,
[5165.18 → 5166.54] I kind of would bet
[5166.54 → 5167.74] that it will hurt
[5167.74 → 5168.32] watch time.
[5169.02 → 5169.50] Um,
[5169.50 → 5170.96] and I just find it
[5170.96 → 5171.78] very funny,
[5172.04 → 5172.50] um,
[5172.50 → 5173.22] that they are just
[5173.22 → 5174.80] continuing to steal features
[5174.80 → 5175.50] from porn sites.
[5177.50 → 5178.62] Those are the two things
[5178.62 → 5179.46] that I wanted to bring up.
[5179.46 → 5179.82] Okay,
[5179.96 → 5180.14] well,
[5180.18 → 5181.58] I guess that's pretty good then.
[5181.82 → 5182.60] We could also,
[5182.88 → 5183.28] um,
[5183.48 → 5184.66] we could also talk about
[5184.66 → 5186.98] the RTX 40 rumour mill spills.
[5187.58 → 5188.16] Rumours have emerged
[5188.16 → 5188.60] this week
[5188.60 → 5189.62] that NVIDIA's upcoming
[5189.62 → 5191.26] Add Lovelace architecture
[5191.26 → 5192.26] may be coming earlier
[5192.26 → 5193.00] than expected.
[5193.46 → 5194.96] Maybe early Q3.
[5195.20 → 5195.94] That could be as early
[5195.94 → 5197.04] as mid-July.
[5197.84 → 5198.36] Um,
[5198.68 → 5200.00] Anthony's note says
[5200.00 → 5200.68] pronounced
[5200.68 → 5201.56] cordite
[5201.56 → 5203.00] seven Mimi.
[5204.00 → 5204.24] Oh,
[5204.32 → 5205.28] that's the user
[5205.28 → 5206.44] who tweeted.
[5206.58 → 5207.64] We could see it in Q3.
[5208.06 → 5209.24] Leaked specs are
[5209.24 → 5211.52] that the AD102-300
[5211.52 → 5211.96] could have
[5211.96 → 5213.30] 16,000
[5213.30 → 5214.86] FP32 CUBA cores,
[5215.28 → 5216.56] 24 gigabytes
[5216.56 → 5217.90] of GDDR6 memory,
[5218.10 → 5219.50] 450 watt
[5219.50 → 5219.94] TDP,
[5220.26 → 5220.94] and double
[5220.94 → 5222.82] the RTX 3090's
[5222.82 → 5223.24] performance.
[5223.46 → 5224.14] That is,
[5224.32 → 5224.56] whew,
[5224.96 → 5225.58] pretty incredible.
[5226.18 → 5227.38] It looks like it is going to be
[5227.38 → 5228.86] a pretty substantial update
[5228.86 → 5229.40] based on
[5229.40 → 5230.60] the latest rumours
[5230.60 → 5230.96] when
[5230.96 → 5232.06] it had been rumoured
[5232.06 → 5232.64] that it was going to be
[5232.64 → 5233.66] more of a refresh.
[5233.66 → 5235.92] And at the rate
[5235.92 → 5236.86] that RTX 40
[5236.86 → 5237.66] is apparently being
[5237.66 → 5238.22] pulled in
[5238.22 → 5238.94] and the rate that
[5238.94 → 5240.20] ARK is being pushed out,
[5240.40 → 5241.02] we could see
[5241.02 → 5241.70] Add Lovelace
[5241.70 → 5242.92] before we see ARK,
[5243.06 → 5244.24] especially in the West.
[5244.72 → 5245.16] Crazy.
[5245.72 → 5246.24] Change of plans
[5246.24 → 5247.02] may or may not
[5247.02 → 5247.70] have been accelerated
[5247.70 → 5248.68] by some combination
[5248.68 → 5249.60] of the Crypto Crash,
[5249.74 → 5250.52] RDNA 3,
[5250.72 → 5251.52] and ARK.
[5251.76 → 5252.12] Or,
[5252.24 → 5252.90] the original rumours
[5252.90 → 5253.84] were just flat out wrong,
[5253.94 → 5254.50] which is also
[5254.50 → 5255.46] a possibility.
[5255.46 → 5258.06] There was one more thing.
[5258.66 → 5258.96] Oh yeah,
[5259.12 → 5259.88] AMD says
[5259.88 → 5260.48] their
[5260.48 → 5262.06] Radeon cards
[5262.06 → 5263.10] are better bang for the buck.
[5263.56 → 5264.64] They're mostly right.
[5265.60 → 5266.02] Oh,
[5266.10 → 5266.86] I should disclose
[5266.86 → 5267.78] that we have worked
[5267.78 → 5268.16] with AMD
[5268.16 → 5269.14] in a sponsored capacity
[5269.14 → 5270.28] around Radeon recently.
[5270.42 → 5271.70] That video hasn't come out yet,
[5272.04 → 5272.88] but it's
[5272.88 → 5274.28] about sort of
[5274.28 → 5274.80] getting the most
[5274.80 → 5275.92] out of your Radeon card.
[5276.60 → 5276.84] So,
[5277.02 → 5277.70] that's there.
[5278.10 → 5278.80] Just wanted to make sure
[5278.80 → 5279.26] that's clear,
[5279.38 → 5279.98] but this is just
[5279.98 → 5280.84] editorial coverage
[5280.84 → 5282.40] of AMD's marketing head,
[5282.48 → 5283.04] Frank Azor,
[5283.12 → 5284.36] posting an interesting chart
[5284.36 → 5284.94] on Tuesday
[5284.94 → 5286.26] comparing the performance,
[5286.52 → 5286.92] power usage,
[5287.02 → 5287.62] and price
[5287.62 → 5289.70] of AMD's GPU lineup
[5289.70 → 5291.32] compared to the competition.
[5292.40 → 5293.28] As a long-time gamer,
[5293.40 → 5294.36] I'm grateful for the renewed,
[5294.48 → 5294.74] blah, blah,
[5294.80 → 5295.08] et cetera,
[5295.16 → 5295.44] et cetera,
[5295.50 → 5295.84] et cetera.
[5296.08 → 5296.98] And it actually,
[5297.12 → 5297.32] like,
[5297.52 → 5299.18] looks kind of not stupid.
[5299.88 → 5300.24] Um,
[5300.96 → 5301.40] yeah.
[5303.54 → 5304.18] I mean,
[5304.36 → 5305.18] 3090,
[5305.34 → 5306.48] I love that they didn't
[5306.48 → 5307.98] even include 3090 Ti
[5307.98 → 5308.60] because it's just,
[5308.72 → 5308.80] like,
[5308.84 → 5309.72] sort of irrelevant.
[5312.26 → 5312.82] And now,
[5312.86 → 5313.36] they're not saying
[5313.36 → 5314.62] they have the performance crown,
[5314.62 → 5316.54] the 3090 is a higher performing card
[5316.54 → 5317.86] than the 6950 XT,
[5318.20 → 5318.54] but,
[5318.62 → 5318.94] like,
[5320.06 → 5322.26] at $600 more.
[5323.44 → 5323.84] Um,
[5324.58 → 5324.78] wait,
[5324.84 → 5325.44] are they saying
[5325.44 → 5326.22] better FPS?
[5326.62 → 5326.98] Really?
[5327.18 → 5327.36] Mm,
[5327.48 → 5328.72] what games are you guys testing?
[5329.70 → 5330.26] Uh,
[5331.18 → 5331.56] actually,
[5331.68 → 5331.92] okay,
[5332.08 → 5333.26] I actually didn't watch
[5333.26 → 5335.48] our 6950 XT review.
[5335.62 → 5336.52] I was on vacation.
[5336.96 → 5337.32] So,
[5337.54 → 5337.88] apparently,
[5338.04 → 5338.96] it's faster
[5338.96 → 5340.24] than the 6900 XT
[5340.24 → 5340.80] than I thought.
[5340.94 → 5341.08] So,
[5341.14 → 5341.66] I was not,
[5341.70 → 5343.04] I was not expecting that result.
[5343.04 → 5343.32] Okay,
[5343.32 → 5343.54] cool.
[5344.14 → 5344.42] So,
[5344.60 → 5345.08] that's neat.
[5345.28 → 5347.08] You guys can learn more about that.
[5347.16 → 5348.44] Hot Hardware took it upon themselves
[5348.44 → 5349.32] to verify the claims,
[5349.40 → 5350.00] and as it turns out,
[5350.02 → 5350.78] it's pretty much true.
[5351.30 → 5352.42] AMD did not disclose
[5352.42 → 5353.08] their testing suite,
[5353.18 → 5354.12] but Hot Hardware found
[5354.12 → 5354.98] through their testing
[5354.98 → 5356.54] that in their testing suite,
[5356.62 → 5357.36] so long as the games
[5357.36 → 5358.82] weren't to ray tracing heavy,
[5358.96 → 5359.80] AMD tended to win
[5359.80 → 5361.24] in both price to performance
[5361.24 → 5362.70] and price per watt.
[5364.12 → 5364.68] It should be noted
[5364.68 → 5365.86] that AMD may not be winning
[5365.86 → 5367.16] if you go by MSRP alone,
[5367.46 → 5368.64] because NVIDIA cards
[5368.64 → 5369.50] are still suffering
[5369.50 → 5370.36] from inflated prices
[5370.36 → 5370.92] due to demand,
[5370.92 → 5371.86] although that may change
[5371.86 → 5372.72] now that AMD's like,
[5372.82 → 5372.92] hey,
[5372.96 → 5373.46] by the way,
[5373.60 → 5374.58] us,
[5374.68 → 5375.02] we're here.
[5375.42 → 5376.42] I really wish
[5376.42 → 5377.22] they had a better
[5377.22 → 5378.42] encoder.
[5379.26 → 5379.60] I am,
[5379.66 → 5380.70] I'm excited to see
[5380.70 → 5381.68] what they come out with
[5381.68 → 5382.62] with RDNA 3
[5382.62 → 5384.44] because as a content creator,
[5384.72 → 5386.50] it's a big deal for me.
[5386.64 → 5387.46] I can't just have
[5387.46 → 5388.32] a crap tier
[5388.32 → 5389.54] GPU video encoder.
[5390.98 → 5391.68] And I mean,
[5391.76 → 5392.04] it's,
[5392.08 → 5393.18] it's going to impact things
[5393.18 → 5393.88] because like,
[5394.36 → 5396.70] with how much streaming
[5396.70 → 5398.10] is going on these days,
[5398.10 → 5401.20] that's important.
[5401.42 → 5402.22] Yes and no.
[5402.46 → 5402.50] Like,
[5402.62 → 5403.68] it's still a minority,
[5404.06 → 5405.18] but it's still a feature
[5405.18 → 5405.96] people care about
[5405.96 → 5406.68] just in case.
[5406.84 → 5407.34] And genuinely,
[5407.54 → 5408.16] a lot of streamers
[5408.16 → 5409.10] are putting their specs
[5409.10 → 5410.52] below their streams.
[5410.78 → 5411.68] And if people are like,
[5411.72 → 5411.86] oh,
[5411.86 → 5413.20] I should buy a computer,
[5413.32 → 5413.58] whatever.
[5413.92 → 5414.12] I mean,
[5414.12 → 5415.00] apparently you can form
[5415.00 → 5417.34] a whole ass PC building company
[5417.34 → 5418.94] based around sponsoring streamers.
[5419.02 → 5419.68] What were they called again?
[5419.90 → 5420.50] I literally don't remember.
[5420.50 → 5421.14] The one that went under?
[5421.74 → 5422.24] I don't know.
[5422.40 → 5422.70] Artisan.
[5422.90 → 5423.20] Artisan.
[5423.34 → 5423.52] Yeah.
[5423.70 → 5423.94] Yeah.
[5424.16 → 5424.32] Like,
[5424.82 → 5425.70] I'd never even heard of them.
[5425.78 → 5426.00] They had what,
[5426.04 → 5426.90] like 40 employees
[5426.90 → 5427.76] or something like that?
[5428.04 → 5428.30] Yeah.
[5428.50 → 5428.84] Okay.
[5429.18 → 5429.38] Yeah.
[5429.48 → 5429.84] So like,
[5429.90 → 5430.86] they're moving PCs
[5430.86 → 5431.66] and they're moving PCs
[5431.66 → 5432.56] based off what they have.
[5433.06 → 5433.90] So it matters.
[5434.00 → 5434.22] All right.
[5434.22 → 5435.24] We got a couple more
[5435.24 → 5436.20] merch messages
[5436.20 → 5437.40] to go through here, guys.
[5437.96 → 5438.76] From Jonathan,
[5439.26 → 5440.30] how do you keep your beards
[5440.30 → 5441.50] looking so awesome?
[5442.18 → 5443.28] I don't think mine looks awesome.
[5443.38 → 5444.36] I think this looks better than mine.
[5444.38 → 5444.48] Well,
[5444.50 → 5445.58] Yvonne takes care of herself
[5445.58 → 5446.12] really well.
[5446.22 → 5447.28] I don't really have to do anything.
[5448.14 → 5448.84] It's a joke.
[5449.34 → 5450.38] I don't even get it.
[5450.86 → 5451.88] You don't know what a beard is?
[5451.88 → 5451.94] Oh,
[5451.94 → 5453.10] I think that makes sense.
[5453.68 → 5454.18] I don't,
[5454.24 → 5455.06] but I think I just kind of
[5455.06 → 5455.56] put it together.
[5456.00 → 5456.02] Yeah.
[5456.02 → 5456.46] Um,
[5457.58 → 5459.28] okay.
[5459.66 → 5461.10] I don't really do anything either.
[5461.30 → 5462.70] I just have to condition it
[5462.70 → 5464.32] because otherwise Yvonne gets mad at me
[5464.32 → 5465.24] because it's too scratchy.
[5465.28 → 5465.84] It's too pokey.
[5466.08 → 5466.22] Yeah.
[5466.28 → 5466.60] And then,
[5466.66 → 5466.82] oh,
[5466.92 → 5467.58] I do,
[5467.72 → 5468.02] I like,
[5468.08 → 5468.78] I shave it.
[5469.00 → 5469.62] So I,
[5469.66 → 5470.52] I go to,
[5470.60 → 5470.68] I,
[5470.88 → 5471.74] number four,
[5472.18 → 5472.60] I think.
[5472.74 → 5474.08] So I just go like this,
[5474.34 → 5474.92] number four.
[5475.04 → 5476.28] And then I take my,
[5476.38 → 5476.98] my like,
[5477.10 → 5477.68] um,
[5477.80 → 5478.78] electric shaver,
[5478.88 → 5479.08] you know,
[5479.12 → 5480.20] the three circles thing
[5480.20 → 5482.38] that I use to like clean up here.
[5482.46 → 5482.98] And I,
[5483.12 → 5484.72] it has like a flip out blade thing.
[5484.76 → 5485.36] And I just go like,
[5485.42 → 5485.62] yeah,
[5485.68 → 5486.40] along the lip,
[5486.54 → 5487.28] the bottom of the lip.
[5487.74 → 5490.74] And then I also use it to kind of clean up the bottom at the
[5490.84 → 5491.50] at the neckline.
[5491.50 → 5492.14] And then that's it.
[5493.14 → 5493.50] Yeah.
[5494.46 → 5494.82] Yeah.
[5495.66 → 5496.78] Mine's just taking its,
[5496.86 → 5498.92] its sweet time becoming thicker.
[5499.28 → 5500.82] It's been thin for a long time.
[5500.92 → 5502.28] It is getting thicker over time.
[5502.42 → 5505.54] Mine was super thin until I reached like past 30.
[5505.78 → 5505.98] Yeah.
[5506.26 → 5506.62] So,
[5506.62 → 5508.94] and then I always thought I couldn't grow a beard.
[5508.94 → 5511.70] And then I was like lazy about it at the beginning of the lockdowns.
[5511.70 → 5512.30] And I was like,
[5512.48 → 5512.64] oh,
[5512.72 → 5514.18] I can grow facial hair now.
[5514.42 → 5518.28] And like looking at what my dad is capable of doing when he lets his growth out,
[5518.68 → 5519.60] I'll be fine.
[5519.92 → 5521.30] It's just not quite there yet.
[5521.48 → 5521.86] It's going to get there.
[5522.12 → 5523.22] It's going to take some time.
[5523.44 → 5523.66] Yeah.
[5523.92 → 5524.72] It's going to take some time.
[5524.82 → 5525.58] Uh,
[5526.50 → 5528.80] this question is from Christopher Robin.
[5529.20 → 5531.56] I don't know if this was an accidental Linus curation,
[5531.56 → 5532.24] uh,
[5532.30 → 5534.62] but they asked,
[5534.84 → 5535.22] uh,
[5535.48 → 5535.66] well,
[5535.72 → 5537.28] here's a donation to help you guys out,
[5537.36 → 5539.52] saving up gift cards for the backpack and screwdriver.
[5539.88 → 5540.16] Awesome.
[5540.72 → 5541.02] Uh,
[5541.02 → 5543.96] they missed the long sleeve constellation shirt because of shipping costs.
[5544.06 → 5544.32] Anyway,
[5544.32 → 5546.08] I could pay extra to get shipped with the backpack.
[5548.04 → 5548.44] No,
[5548.60 → 5552.14] because we're producing them now and that's all we're producing.
[5552.54 → 5554.80] So we just don't really like,
[5554.80 → 5555.36] we can't,
[5555.48 → 5559.56] we can't spin up the silk screen shop to do it like one shirt.
[5559.64 → 5560.72] It's just not really feasible.
[5561.48 → 5561.92] Um,
[5562.28 → 5562.72] sorry.
[5564.90 → 5565.74] From Joe,
[5566.14 → 5568.80] do you have a moment to talk about our dark Lord and saviour Cthulhu?
[5568.80 → 5569.36] Cthulhu.
[5570.64 → 5571.08] Uh,
[5571.08 → 5574.54] Cthulhu is not a sponsor yet.
[5575.40 → 5575.84] Sure.
[5575.96 → 5577.20] If he could figure that out then.
[5577.40 → 5577.50] Yeah.
[5577.62 → 5578.00] Um,
[5578.64 → 5579.04] I mean,
[5579.10 → 5580.86] usually when people ask you that question,
[5580.86 → 5582.90] they then proceed to talk to you about it.
[5582.90 → 5583.54] So I'm waiting.
[5583.96 → 5586.36] I'm assuming I'm going to hear like a deep,
[5586.36 → 5587.18] uh,
[5587.32 → 5588.80] raspy voice in my head.
[5588.96 → 5589.18] Yeah.
[5589.50 → 5591.26] I'll pull up Joe on a discord.
[5593.38 → 5594.30] From Oliver.
[5594.78 → 5596.52] What games do you play with their children?
[5596.80 → 5597.02] Uh,
[5597.02 → 5597.30] Linus?
[5598.06 → 5598.36] Oh,
[5598.60 → 5599.26] um,
[5600.38 → 5600.90] man.
[5601.10 → 5601.30] Uh,
[5601.30 → 5604.84] there's a really fun one called take lings house party that my kids love to play.
[5605.30 → 5607.00] It's a VR game where there's,
[5607.12 → 5613.28] you're a homeowner in VR and you have to like to get the take lings who are trying to steal your stuff or like sabotage your kitchen or whatever.
[5613.80 → 5614.08] Uh,
[5614.08 → 5616.72] and all the take lings play with controllers on the couch around.
[5616.72 → 5618.40] So it's a really fun party game.
[5618.54 → 5619.34] It's actually really cool.
[5619.58 → 5620.06] Um,
[5620.10 → 5620.48] what else?
[5620.64 → 5620.78] Uh,
[5620.78 → 5621.04] they,
[5621.22 → 5622.70] they really like playing Minecraft Dungeons.
[5622.90 → 5625.76] It's just like a super basic dungeon crawler.
[5625.88 → 5626.30] It's Diablo,
[5626.52 → 5627.84] but like Minecraft themed.
[5628.12 → 5628.72] It's Diablo,
[5628.72 → 5631.20] but surprisingly even more basic than Diablo.
[5631.40 → 5631.64] Yeah.
[5631.74 → 5631.96] Uh,
[5631.96 → 5632.44] that's one.
[5632.50 → 5632.66] Well,
[5632.74 → 5633.38] it's a little,
[5633.48 → 5633.84] it's deep.
[5633.92 → 5635.02] It's deeper than Diablo one.
[5635.10 → 5635.60] That's for sure.
[5635.98 → 5636.16] Well,
[5636.22 → 5636.46] yeah.
[5636.70 → 5637.08] Uh,
[5637.22 → 5639.64] but that's also a game from like 20 times.
[5639.88 → 5640.14] Ooh.
[5640.70 → 5641.10] Yeah.
[5641.10 → 5642.12] 25 years ago.
[5642.22 → 5642.52] Ooh.
[5642.76 → 5643.20] Anyway.
[5645.94 → 5646.38] Yeah.
[5646.38 → 5646.74] So,
[5646.90 → 5647.10] uh,
[5647.10 → 5647.82] Minecraft Dungeons.
[5648.10 → 5648.48] Um,
[5648.90 → 5649.24] you know,
[5649.32 → 5651.16] my son likes to play tower fall,
[5651.36 → 5651.78] uh,
[5651.78 → 5653.02] with me and Luke.
[5653.04 → 5654.10] So we've done that a fair bit.
[5654.12 → 5655.24] He's actually like pretty good.
[5655.24 → 5655.60] Like he'll,
[5655.82 → 5657.22] he'll win rounds sometimes.
[5657.96 → 5658.44] Like,
[5658.44 → 5660.96] increasingly sometimes.
[5661.12 → 5661.34] Yeah.
[5661.34 → 5662.58] It's amazing how quick they learn.
[5662.66 → 5662.76] Hey,
[5662.78 → 5663.26] at the start,
[5663.30 → 5663.98] it was like,
[5663.98 → 5664.78] no.
[5665.00 → 5667.10] And then it became like maybe once or twice a session.
[5667.10 → 5668.10] And now it's becoming like,
[5668.16 → 5668.54] he's like,
[5668.54 → 5670.38] he can actually win full matches.
[5670.56 → 5670.84] Yeah.
[5671.36 → 5672.16] Pretty competitive.
[5672.30 → 5673.18] I don't like it.
[5673.18 → 5676.42] From David.
[5677.14 → 5680.28] I've heard you guys talk a lot about ideas that never happened because it wouldn't perform well.
[5680.52 → 5683.78] Do you guys have a favourite video that got away or something you really wanted to do,
[5683.84 → 5684.90] but just couldn't justify?
[5684.90 → 5684.98] Bye.
[5691.78 → 5693.22] I can open up the dock.
[5693.70 → 5696.74] The video tracker dock is a black hole.
[5696.88 → 5698.00] I know there's been a bunch,
[5698.12 → 5699.18] but I honestly don't.
[5699.32 → 5699.62] I mean,
[5699.70 → 5701.48] we still haven't done the Murphy bed PC.
[5701.84 → 5703.08] That's a matter of time.
[5703.08 → 5703.76] Um,
[5705.04 → 5706.90] oh man.
[5709.40 → 5714.08] We still haven't done a double-blind to see if people can hear the difference between headphone amps and Days.
[5715.20 → 5715.60] Uh,
[5715.72 → 5715.94] man,
[5715.98 → 5717.18] there's so many,
[5717.38 → 5718.84] oh,
[5719.06 → 5720.98] many videos in here.
[5720.98 → 5726.90] I'd have to really rack the memory because it's not something I really consider.
[5727.24 → 5727.98] PC building speed run,
[5728.06 → 5729.14] any percent world record.
[5729.62 → 5731.30] It's one that we've got in here.
[5731.92 → 5733.36] Call me Chris collabs that we shot already.
[5733.42 → 5734.28] I can delete that.
[5734.80 → 5735.16] Man,
[5735.22 → 5736.58] there are so many things.
[5736.76 → 5738.50] I've never liked,
[5738.54 → 5739.40] and I think you know this,
[5739.44 → 5742.44] I've never liked the whole speed building thing.
[5742.82 → 5743.04] Well,
[5743.10 → 5743.64] you had to,
[5743.74 → 5745.26] you had to do it at like an event,
[5745.34 → 5746.92] a sponsored event or something once.
[5746.98 → 5748.36] And wasn't it like kind of a fiasco?
[5748.46 → 5749.26] We trolled them.
[5749.32 → 5749.56] Remember?
[5750.10 → 5750.36] Oh yeah.
[5750.36 → 5752.22] Didn't we wear like horse head masks or something?
[5752.36 → 5753.52] I wanted to troll them.
[5753.58 → 5753.82] It was,
[5753.96 → 5754.24] it was,
[5754.64 → 5755.38] you weren't there.
[5755.44 → 5756.24] It was just me going.
[5756.38 → 5756.48] Oh,
[5756.52 → 5756.76] I thought,
[5756.86 → 5758.30] did I do a horse mask one at some point?
[5758.34 → 5758.84] It doesn't matter.
[5758.94 → 5759.12] Okay.
[5759.16 → 5759.78] So it was,
[5759.78 → 5760.60] it was just me going.
[5760.78 → 5762.34] I talked to you about how like,
[5763.34 → 5764.44] I should do it.
[5764.64 → 5764.88] Right?
[5764.92 → 5766.50] Like it was a good idea for the company at that time,
[5766.78 → 5768.78] but it's a stupid thing.
[5768.94 → 5769.42] So like,
[5769.44 → 5771.22] I wanted to spice it up, and you were like,
[5771.28 → 5772.52] why don't you do this?
[5772.62 → 5774.36] And you told me to wear a horse head mask.
[5774.52 → 5774.66] Oh,
[5774.70 → 5775.12] that's right.
[5775.24 → 5776.18] And they like,
[5776.24 → 5778.96] were a little apprehensive about it.
[5779.08 → 5780.28] So I just stopped talking about it.
[5780.28 → 5782.74] Just smuggled it on stage and stashed it under the table.
[5782.96 → 5784.24] And then when they told us to start,
[5784.30 → 5786.94] I pulled it out from under the table and put it on and just did it that way
[5786.94 → 5787.26] anyway.
[5787.80 → 5790.00] And that stream went from like,
[5790.00 → 5792.74] didn't really matter to top of Twitch because of that.
[5793.08 → 5796.48] So like wild success and totally worked out,
[5796.58 → 5800.12] but it only did because of the horse head mask.
[5800.28 → 5802.54] No one cared about speed building a computer.
[5802.54 → 5803.28] Cause why?
[5803.28 → 5803.98] Like,
[5804.04 → 5804.48] I don't know.
[5804.54 → 5808.26] I've never actually do is go carefully and take care of your things.
[5808.42 → 5808.52] Like,
[5808.56 → 5812.18] like what we've been trying to teach people forever is to do it properly,
[5812.18 → 5813.26] not to do it necessarily.
[5813.26 → 5813.96] Do as we say,
[5814.06 → 5814.66] not as we do.
[5814.78 → 5815.02] Yeah.
[5815.58 → 5816.28] And then like,
[5816.32 → 5816.66] if you're,
[5816.72 → 5818.28] if you're like factory building computers,
[5818.28 → 5819.14] that's a different thing.
[5819.34 → 5819.72] Yes.
[5820.06 → 5820.60] But like,
[5820.66 → 5821.58] but then you'll have a team of people.
[5821.66 → 5822.80] You'll be doing it in an assembly line.
[5822.94 → 5823.24] Yeah.
[5823.38 → 5823.88] It's different.
[5823.88 → 5826.86] Just like we finished assembling this WAN show.
[5827.18 → 5828.52] We will see you again next week.
[5828.94 → 5829.74] Same bad time.
[5829.84 → 5830.64] Same bad channel.
[5831.08 → 5832.42] Thanks for tuning in guys.
[5832.56 → 5833.00] Bye.
[5833.00 → 5855.36] The show is brought to you by origin PC.
[5855.36 → 5856.08] So.
