[68.48 --> 83.60]  It's pretty clear that we are never going to introduce the leader of the labs and they do not exist yeah it's just a strategy to keep you guys watching the WAN show week after week after week we should just never yeah we should just never reveal who it is.

[154.12 --> 160.64]  did not have the pleasure of meeting in person shank mods
[160.64 --> 169.86]  hey the best guest reveal ever i know right i was here the whole time hey how's it going
[169.86 --> 175.34]  it's going good it's been a crazy week definitely crazy week do you guys want to talk about what
[175.34 --> 182.96]  you did so um i don't know how much well not in too much detail yeah no i think no let's get some
[182.96 --> 189.90]  detail because the reality of it is i don't really know what happened okay so shank mods reached out
[189.90 --> 196.60]  he's like hey it'd be super cool to do a collab and i'm like well first i didn't reply to your email
[196.60 --> 204.44]  for like a month well colton did so it's all good sure so anyway once i finally clued into the existence
[204.44 --> 211.26]  of this email i'm like yeah that would be pretty freaking awesome um what are we doing and we kind
[211.26 --> 217.20]  of nailed it all down and figured out that you were going to fly out here and we were going to do an
[217.20 --> 225.36]  rtx 3090 gaming pc right in a hot wheels pc case yeah and then you got here you brought the case
[225.36 --> 233.22]  you brought the plan and i got i brought covid so i didn't get to participate at all and then
[233.22 --> 238.46]  apparently you were like oh linus can't be there well that's okay who was your backup who was your
[238.46 --> 245.56]  who was your next linus so i was actually um we were working with um alex because you were going to host
[245.56 --> 252.24]  and then alex was going to be the one who was like working on the video like he was going to um he was
[252.24 --> 256.38]  going to be the one like doing a lot of the engineering production stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah
[256.38 --> 265.66]  and then um and then uh when like the day before i flew in uh colton was like oh by the way linus is
[265.66 --> 270.66]  sick hold on wait wait wait one quick thing um i'm allowed to say i have covid but we can't disclose
[270.66 --> 275.82]  any particulars about anyone else's medical condition i'm sure alex doesn't care what we say
[275.82 --> 287.42]  but let's just say alex couldn't make it to work yeah okay yeah so um and then so it was
[287.42 --> 294.22]  out i was talking with um colton and now he he was like yeah alex isn't gonna be able to make it to
[294.22 --> 299.98]  work and then i'm like okay well at least we have anthony right then he's like about that
[299.98 --> 310.00]  and then like whenever whenever um we were at the door and he was uh scanning in um and then his key
[310.00 --> 314.82]  didn't work and i'm like did you get fired for real this time like are you gonna leave me too
[314.82 --> 322.50]  it's gonna abandon you outside of the building good luck yeah so um less than half of the writing team
[322.50 --> 328.16]  is in office this week this has been the week from absolute hell uh we need to definitely get a
[328.16 --> 335.48]  shout out for james this week who james has had a conversation with and he's like okay um realistically
[335.48 --> 340.94]  i have so much to do this week there is no way that we can conceivably do anything other than
[340.94 --> 348.24]  just put shank mods in a room and all of a sudden he's hosting an ltt and i'm like no no hold on hold on
[348.24 --> 352.84]  you know he's actually a great content creator i know i'm talking about you as though you know
[352.84 --> 358.48]  we're not right next to each other right now because shank mods yeah 100 like great you know
[358.48 --> 365.10]  actual good youtuber and all that but he he doesn't make ltt videos like we need we need something on
[365.10 --> 371.72]  set who knows yeah our style yeah my content's very different it was that was part of why i wanted to i
[371.72 --> 375.24]  wanted to kind of see how you guys your machine works behind the scene to kind of
[375.24 --> 382.76]  do your thunder so you ended up with you tynen from creator warehouse who has never been involved
[382.76 --> 388.36]  in video production on our side at all stuck in a room trying to mod a case and i was like no no
[388.36 --> 394.54]  james you need to like you need to be there because you're the only one on the writing staff
[394.54 --> 402.30]  who's actually in the only people in office were james and then our two newest team members
[402.30 --> 409.42]  ploof and adam oh man so and they were both busy trying to get videos done for this week because we
[409.42 --> 414.94]  had no other freaking writers um now some people were working from home but it's still more challenging
[414.94 --> 421.90]  and then our most prolific host obviously wasn't in so i want to hear more about this all right so i
[421.90 --> 425.98]  wanted to say shout out james for making it work being able to be on set with you guys do you think it
[425.98 --> 431.10]  was helpful having him there james was awesome james did a great job of helping kind of like
[431.10 --> 438.50]  um piece the whole thing we we me and tynen uh we're uh we had the build totally covered like we had a
[438.50 --> 446.76]  plan we had the stuff all sorted out um the one thing that um but um james was excellent because he
[446.76 --> 452.06]  was able to tie it all together into a story to really make it content which was like he had kind of a
[452.06 --> 457.96]  overarching you know idea for kind of the narrative and how we were gonna show it what shots we needed
[457.96 --> 463.36]  and all that stuff and we handled the build stuff because uh build build the builds are more my
[463.36 --> 471.88]  specialty whereas right unless so i'm like i i always tell people i'm not really a youtuber i'm like a
[471.88 --> 478.16]  modder that makes videos so yeah that makes sense and you know what i told james i was like dude
[478.16 --> 485.74]  if you are not on set we are gonna have a whole bunch of footage and we are not gonna have a video
[485.74 --> 494.66]  yeah it is gonna be worse yeah like i was telling um i was telling uh this guy over here luke um i was
[494.66 --> 500.82]  before the set i was so for my virtual boy video i just take my camera and i point it at my desk
[500.82 --> 506.32]  and i just have it rolling and i had about a terabyte and a half of 1080p footage for that video
[506.32 --> 517.06]  a terabyte and a half yeah what yeah 1080p footage yeah i had to i had to buy a new ssd to fit it all
[517.06 --> 524.80]  like on the edit drive like i had to buy a separate like edit drive to run it run it off of that because
[524.80 --> 533.30]  my boot drive filled up so i'm like uh okay for that video so i hate it so much oh man so yeah i'm
[533.30 --> 537.96]  digging through all my but the thing is if if like when i fried my screen i caught it on camera
[537.96 --> 543.78]  like i just have to watch and i'm like what month was it when my screen blew up again like you know
[543.78 --> 549.70]  and watch back through it like quadruple speed and then listen for me being all angry and i think i
[549.70 --> 555.46]  found it yeah yeah trevor w says uh sounds like you need a nas upgrade video or something
[555.46 --> 562.74]  yeah maybe that'd be pretty cool but we've got we've got potentially a few of those i had uh
[562.74 --> 568.88]  dank pods reached out to me about a a like server or nas upgrade video at some point as well really
[568.88 --> 574.68]  yeah um i guess maybe i could drop the news that we're working on one for dream right now
[574.68 --> 582.54]  oh hey there you go yeah so that's pretty cool yeah yeah i should build myself uh i should build
[582.54 --> 586.46]  myself a back door into it so that i can dig through his pictures and find out what he looks
[586.46 --> 595.82]  like jk jk dude that is absolutely not gonna that is not gonna happen i'm i'm i'm 100 respecting your uh
[595.82 --> 603.02]  you're not wanting to yeah yeah 100 also we're not even configuring the software on it i wouldn't even
[603.02 --> 607.72]  be able to if i wanted to yeah yeah yeah hardware exploits but yeah i'm pretty i'm pretty excited
[607.72 --> 614.10]  oh man oh man oh man float plane chat float plane chat but did he cheat linus i'm gonna be honest
[614.10 --> 619.58]  with you guys i do not i'm sure linus has no idea yeah
[619.58 --> 628.68]  i don't know surprising to me i don't know if there could be something less meaningful to me
[628.68 --> 635.80]  than uh cheating at okay i shouldn't say this i was gonna say anything less meaningful to me than
[635.80 --> 640.22]  cheating at a single player game because technically speed running is not a single player game no it is
[640.22 --> 648.58]  a multiplayer competition that that can be um you know a single player game and so you know did that
[648.58 --> 657.86]  happen frankly i just i just don't i i i yeah i just don't care um i know that community is probably
[657.86 --> 664.14]  still mad i shouldn't say probably it's very clear to me from reading the chat that that community is
[664.14 --> 671.86]  still mad i was gonna say uh next next video on coming soon to ltt uh apology video to the speed
[671.86 --> 678.44]  running community yeah yeah yeah no mad respect to the speed running community no way i'm just saying
[678.44 --> 685.68]  that as far as i'm concerned i don't want to make that video please no no no as far as i'm concerned
[685.68 --> 691.06]  this is this is a content creator that has done a lot of other stuff as well who needs a naz
[691.06 --> 700.06]  and it was an opportunity i'll just put it this way to build a very very fancy naz
[700.06 --> 708.48]  it's a real nice even i'm like whoa look at this thing you might call it a dream naz oh
[708.48 --> 717.58]  very good you two puns you guys are both going at it yeah um i know right so okay shank tell us about
[717.58 --> 726.44]  the mods so um we so originally the idea came to me from when i was almost finished with the project
[726.44 --> 733.12]  uh i was doing lots and lots of feature creep and a guy he goes by the alias jeffrey jeffrey jeffrey
[733.12 --> 740.64]  he mentioned to me he's in the small form factor pc community he said yo 30 90s half length and i'm like
[740.64 --> 746.68]  you could do it i'm like uh but it's but i was like so close to like finishing where like i could
[746.68 --> 752.78]  have had to like do a ton of work so i'm like you know what i'll throw the bone at linus and see if
[752.78 --> 759.04]  he's down to collab on this thing so when i got here the 30 90 y'all had wasn't a founder's edition
[759.04 --> 767.50]  so it actually wasn't totally half length it was actually longer than the chassis itself so that's like
[767.50 --> 774.80]  wait hold on did we get you the asus one or i believe it was the asus one yes the pre-water
[774.80 --> 782.90]  blocked one yes it's slightly longer i didn't even know that yes so it's not because the the
[782.90 --> 788.26]  founder's edition has that like cut out there like for the thing yeah and then this one through it it
[788.26 --> 793.02]  um it's slightly longer than it so it's not the founder's edition reference board we were able to
[793.02 --> 800.14]  make it work like it wasn't that big of a deal um but and we found found clever ways to uh fit that
[800.14 --> 809.24]  inside of there so it's got um we didn't wind up using the uh we didn't wind up using the flex i mean
[809.24 --> 818.52]  the the micro sorry the um sfx l power supply we wound up using two flex atx power supplies
[818.52 --> 829.68]  um and yeah we went with a that's a cool solution yeah in a 5800 x 3d you did the really cool like
[829.68 --> 835.50]  acrylic back we did that so we did an acrylic back as a test thing it wasn't strong enough
[835.50 --> 841.00]  oh but we did um the acrylic back to be able to test everything and for the video it looked really
[841.00 --> 846.64]  cool because you could see inside of it and how like crammed everything is and oh i'm so excited i
[846.64 --> 850.72]  haven't even seen it yet yep we're sitting here going like i tell you how i'm not going to tell
[850.72 --> 855.48]  you how um we did finish the build i'm not going to tell you how well it performs or anything like
[855.48 --> 866.20]  that that's okay i find out so oh man i'm hoping for the best no it's okay yeah so i've got um i've
[866.20 --> 871.48]  i've also got some presents for you linus here some little really yeah i've got some presents for you

[949.34 --> 954.12]  it's like that's awesome it's a circuit board keychain so that's cool and then it was cost
[954.12 --> 959.06]  less than a sticker yeah these are circuit boards like this size are cheaper than stickers like i went
[959.06 --> 965.62]  to get like die cut stickers made and like these were cheaper so i can confirm stickers are extremely
[965.62 --> 971.96]  expensive yeah i remember nick sent me an invoice for our stickers like the stickers we give away on
[971.96 --> 979.18]  lttstore.com and it was literally a six-figure u.s dollar invoice and i was like excuse me
[979.18 --> 989.20]  pardon we're spending how much on stickers like what i was not happy by the way you definitely have to

[1089.50 --> 1096.14]  they got gpus cpus yeah new bfbpus just just just look for a graphics card and that that's what i always
[1096.14 --> 1101.46]  tell people like uh back when i used to work for fries like um whenever i had friends i'm like if you
[1101.46 --> 1106.10]  need help in retail just stand in front of something really expensive and then they'll
[1106.10 --> 1111.16]  they'll swarm to you like makes sense so i've got one more present for you linus this one's kind of a
[1111.16 --> 1118.58]  big deal this one's pretty cool thank you so you have it's not like super super so don't get super
[1118.58 --> 1125.36]  hyped but um i know you've been complaining about your watch so i complain a lot oh i know you i know i
[1125.36 --> 1131.96]  watch man show okay so that's fair you've been complaining about your watch and how you're like
[1131.96 --> 1142.38]  man i oh you don't have one right now so you were like oh um i hate um i hate how like the samsung gear
[1142.38 --> 1149.36]  like it doesn't last a day or and um you said like i want something that just does like notifications
[1149.36 --> 1156.78]  and all that stuff i kind of missed my pebble and stuff well as a pebble time two times kickstarter
[1156.78 --> 1168.54]  enthusiast i've got you a kickstarter edition pebble time no way it's not new but like i've got the
[1168.54 --> 1173.96]  charger so it's it says kickstarter on the back if you want more if you want the 10 day battery life
[1173.96 --> 1180.70]  you can track down a steel but i want you to give this one another shot because okay all right you
[1180.70 --> 1185.42]  will see it on my wrist you'll see it on my wrist well i want to see if it meets your needs because
[1185.42 --> 1191.88]  i've still been i've had this one my time steel for like the longest time and you can see it in my
[1191.88 --> 1196.96]  videos like the battery life you know even though lithium batteries decay and stuff but because it
[1196.96 --> 1203.62]  started with a 10 day battery life i'm still at like a week so yep um that's legit yeah pebbles
[1203.62 --> 1209.86]  pebbles are one of the coolest day cool yeah so that's all yours i'm super into it yeah well pebbles
[1209.86 --> 1215.84]  lit yeah we were all right i'm gonna give it a shot because the reality of it is most of the additional
[1215.84 --> 1222.96]  benefits of like modern smart watches when they work at all are around health right like health
[1222.96 --> 1231.60]  tracking but i switched to the ura ring ages ago and honestly you know i okay i haven't hooked myself up
[1231.60 --> 1237.76]  to a proper you know machine i mean that was a video concept we had years ago we were gonna hook
[1237.76 --> 1244.80]  up to like uh therapeutic grade equipment and then also wear every fitness tracker like consumer grade
[1244.80 --> 1251.50]  fitness tracker and smart watch on the market and see which one actually got closest to real like health
[1251.50 --> 1256.86]  diagnostic equipment right and it was really complicated to get a lab that would cooperate with
[1256.86 --> 1262.42]  us we weren't gonna like stupid ubc local university was like yeah you can rent our lab at the normal
[1262.42 --> 1267.76]  commercial rate i'm like are you guys idiots well at first basically a research project like we're
[1267.76 --> 1273.62]  collaborating this is not us renting a facility from you at first they wanted to pay us and then and
[1273.62 --> 1280.34]  then like right before we were gonna go they were like uh actually psych can you you know do it the
[1280.34 --> 1285.30]  other way around and pay us to borrow our lab and i was like wait what huh no i thought we were doing
[1285.30 --> 1290.66]  this like as a collab thing i even told them like you don't need to pay us yeah like we're providing
[1290.66 --> 1297.86]  all of this equipment and we bring the audience and you guys bring your equipment and some expertise
[1297.86 --> 1304.26]  we work together we publish it together with co-credit like we're just we're working together as like
[1304.26 --> 1310.48]  educators right now this is we're not we're we're not profiting from the data we could make any other
[1310.48 --> 1315.44]  video today i was so excited about that project so some background as to why they wanted to work on it
[1315.44 --> 1320.30]  was there's the in vancouver there's the seawall yeah and there's this thing where like old people
[1320.30 --> 1324.86]  that are trying to stay in shape will will bike or run along the seawall and one of the problems is
[1324.86 --> 1329.58]  that they were they were noticing a trend where they would wear a wearable that would track their
[1329.58 --> 1333.80]  heart rate but it would under report their heart rate that's not good so they would be
[1333.80 --> 1338.28]  over exerting themselves and then they would have heart problems heart failures while they're
[1338.28 --> 1344.26]  running along the wall um so they like wanted to collab with us to work on this cool project and
[1344.26 --> 1348.86]  then they just yeah pulled the plug last minute it's such a project that mattered a lot yeah it was
[1348.86 --> 1355.48]  like actually really cool like i would i haven't compared to anything real but from what feels intuitive
[1355.48 --> 1361.48]  this is so much more accurate than anything else i've ever tried like it's not even close i'd be on the
[1361.48 --> 1366.62]  badminton court running around luke knows how i play hard and my apple watch would be like you need
[1366.62 --> 1376.68]  to stand up for a bit you're talking about you know um or i'd be driving and it'd be like wow great job
[1376.68 --> 1387.62]  staying active meanwhile this thing it's in it's in 15 minute chunks and it it makes perfect sense i can be
[1387.62 --> 1392.96]  like oh yeah that was when i woke up in the middle of the night and there was some physical exertion
[1392.96 --> 1399.66]  you know like you know you can really put together yeah what was i actually doing and it makes sense
[1399.66 --> 1405.62]  right um so if i don't need any of the health tracking stuff at all and i just want notifications
[1405.62 --> 1412.62]  quickly and to be able to tell the time the pebble is still the best solution yeah it's it drives me
[1412.62 --> 1418.28]  nuts that i haven't like seen anything else i i don't want anything like i don't want a dumb phone
[1418.28 --> 1425.10]  on my wrist i want like a better watch like um because like with all the smart watches they're
[1425.10 --> 1430.80]  just like cut down smartphones and they're like they pack on all the features that you know it's like
[1430.80 --> 1436.12]  they do all these things but like they don't do the things i want well which is like to have a week
[1436.12 --> 1440.92]  long battery life to have a screen that's always on that i don't have to flick it and wait for it to
[1440.92 --> 1447.74]  boot up you know to tell the time yeah tell the time and then show the notifications occasionally
[1447.74 --> 1454.68]  control music and like be a watch like so pebbles or you know what i hope someone else makes a pebble
[1454.68 --> 1462.36]  like thing i still have a pebble time kicking around and i still use it almost every probably about every
[1462.36 --> 1468.68]  other day in the summer um i haven't actually tried to use it as a watch and i i honestly like the idea
[1468.68 --> 1474.58]  of going back to the og one to see if it's still better 10 years later almost what what are we at
[1474.58 --> 1480.22]  like eight years the you're saying the the pebble time or the original pebble the kickstarter one that
[1480.22 --> 1486.10]  you just uh is that the og or is that the that's the og one right both of them both of them were uh
[1486.10 --> 1495.54]  so both of them were uh kickstarters so the one i have is the second is the the second one the time
[1495.54 --> 1501.64]  so the time oh that's the time the color one yeah so this is the time perfect okay because mine is
[1501.64 --> 1508.82]  trashed yeah um i use it i i i literally like it has all this uh residue all over the back so it's not
[1508.82 --> 1514.42]  comfortable to wear against my wrist anymore because i upgraded it and i was like oh you know what's
[1514.42 --> 1518.90]  really great about this thing is the physical buttons on it because i couldn't i could never change
[1518.90 --> 1525.24]  the track when i was riding my bike and i was like oh i should just like basically glue my pebble time
[1525.24 --> 1532.36]  to my motorcycle and so i did and it's like kind of trashed now so but there have been times now
[1532.36 --> 1535.94]  that i just haven't had a good experience with anything else that i've been tempted to just like
[1535.94 --> 1544.76]  try and try and get it going again but no yeah if man i'm i'm jacked yeah like i am i am jacked
[1544.76 --> 1550.12]  it's go back to it i'm gonna try it that's uh it's one of the few the pebble is one of the few
[1550.12 --> 1558.28]  technologies where i am like gung-ho like i'm like that and i'm also like a tube monitor nerd as well
[1559.24 --> 1563.00]  so like those two things are like two of the things where i'm just like oh
[1564.84 --> 1566.52]  yeah yeah i love it i'm excited
[1568.60 --> 1573.48]  um all right well i think i think we're probably good there thanks for coming on the show yeah it was
[1573.48 --> 1580.12]  cool that you were able to show the presence uh yeah yeah at like five or five thirty i was like
[1580.12 --> 1586.44]  we'll start like half an hour yeah no we've been been hanging out yeah it was fun though yeah all
[1586.44 --> 1591.08]  right my bad i'll head out thanks for having me guys yeah thanks for coming yeah i'm so sorry i
[1591.08 --> 1597.96]  wasn't able to like hang out in person but um as the title of the video says i like yeah got covid so
[1597.96 --> 1604.60]  it's i was i was telling them it's it's um it's i i think it's kind of you know i've seen the bright
[1604.60 --> 1609.48]  side of things where i've gotten to meet and interact with a bunch of the people i wouldn't
[1609.48 --> 1614.76]  normally so like rather than interacting with the people i see on camera i've gotten to interact with
[1614.76 --> 1621.40]  a bunch of the people i don't normally see on camera and um and i've gotten to see how you know
[1621.40 --> 1628.92]  kind of the you can see how do i describe like because it was an unorthodox thing and it was kind
[1628.92 --> 1634.76]  of in chaos i've gotten to see like more of it and it's been really interesting to see like how um
[1634.76 --> 1642.76]  more of kind of how the business operates and stuff and um also it's um it's been really and also it's
[1642.76 --> 1649.80]  kind of funny that i can like tell people i've been in like the most unorthodox um most unorthodox
[1649.80 --> 1655.16]  ltt collab ever because not only were none of the main hosts in it but i also walked to
[1655.16 --> 1660.68]  walked away with less computer because then i walked here because i gave like i came here with
[1660.68 --> 1667.16]  a computer leaving without one yeah the only club it's like the antsy collab so i thought that was
[1667.16 --> 1672.76]  hilarious man well hey maybe we can make it up to you and do something together on the nas or something
[1672.76 --> 1677.40]  like that i'm totally down to do something else this has been a blast the whole team like you've hired
[1677.40 --> 1682.28]  here and everything like they're all so cool like i hear a lot about them but it was really nice to
[1682.28 --> 1688.76]  like get to like actually meet them i say it i say it all the time the the words that i use to describe
[1688.76 --> 1696.28]  my team that i think are best are world class that's for sure that's all there is to it there's uh there's
[1696.28 --> 1706.20]  very few teams like ours that exist on this planet and uh the fact that they were able to pull that off
[1706.20 --> 1714.76]  so short-handed is absolutely incredible oh yeah i was um i'm i did not feel like i was did not have
[1714.76 --> 1723.32]  the manpower or resources or anything necessary i felt um extremely confident with uh your your team's
[1723.32 --> 1729.24]  killer you'll see you'll see when you see the video um oh i'm so excited yeah the team's awesome i'm they
[1729.24 --> 1736.52]  they they pulled a rabbit out of a hat on this one it was awesome oh they can pull they can pull
[1736.52 --> 1740.84]  a lot of things out of a hat i'll tell you that all right thanks for having me i'm gonna head off
[1740.84 --> 1745.16]  yeah thanks man all right thank you see ya i'm just going to uh
[1745.16 --> 1755.00]  do do do do do do do just slide on over amazing absolutely all right and i will turn this way to
[1755.00 --> 1763.56]  talk to luke now i have two microphones i have dual microphone power yeah that's funny sure yeah let's go
[1763.56 --> 1769.80]  with right there okay all right do you want to jump into uh our first topic which i guess our title topic
[1769.80 --> 1771.64]  because I got COVID.
[1771.64 --> 1773.56]  It's been not that bad.
[1773.56 --> 1777.64]  I've had a lot of people express concern and everything for me.
[1777.64 --> 1779.64]  The first couple of days, pretty rough,
[1779.64 --> 1782.04]  really bad sore throat, wicked headache.
[1782.04 --> 1785.00]  So I guess I have one of the super headachy variants.
[1785.00 --> 1789.84]  I am Vaxxed, boosted, and then second boosted.
[1789.84 --> 1795.16]  So hopefully that is part of what helped me go this long.
[1795.16 --> 1799.72]  And oh man, can I just get out ahead of anyone in the chat
[1799.72 --> 1804.68]  that's like, see, the vaccine doesn't work.
[1804.68 --> 1806.04]  No vaccine is perfect.
[1806.04 --> 1808.44]  They have different levels of efficacy
[1808.44 --> 1810.68]  and it's all very well documented.
[1810.68 --> 1812.20]  No, it's not perfect.
[1812.20 --> 1814.12]  It reduces the severity of symptoms
[1814.12 --> 1818.44]  and the risk of transmission goes down.
[1818.44 --> 1822.20]  But oh man, I just, I got to tell you,
[1822.20 --> 1824.60]  not just the Elon Musk stuff lately,
[1824.60 --> 1827.96]  but I feel like I've been in kind of a spicy mood
[1827.96 --> 1829.24]  for a little while.
[1829.24 --> 1829.40]  Yeah.
[1829.40 --> 1833.48]  That has been causing me to just kind of go off on people.
[1833.48 --> 1837.96]  But man, there was this like, there's this like guitarist
[1837.96 --> 1841.08]  who was talking about how something, something,
[1841.96 --> 1845.16]  they like didn't, they got it and weren't Vaxxed
[1845.16 --> 1845.72]  and they were fine.
[1845.72 --> 1847.88]  I forget what it was, but like something, something, something.
[1847.88 --> 1852.68]  Oh no, I remember it was, their, their tweet was admit
[1852.68 --> 1855.96]  the vaccine does nothing or something like that in response
[1855.96 --> 1857.00]  to me saying I got COVID.
[1857.40 --> 1859.40]  And I'm just like, that's not nothing.
[1859.40 --> 1863.56]  Admit that, you know, absolutely nothing about statistical analysis
[1863.56 --> 1865.00]  and the scientific method.
[1865.72 --> 1870.20]  Go like sample size of one, literally.
[1870.20 --> 1874.76]  And so, yeah, I just, I just haven't had, I just haven't had the kind of patients
[1874.76 --> 1880.20]  that I feel like, um, I like to think that I normally have for things.
[1880.68 --> 1884.52]  And I, maybe it's time to kind of have this conversation that goes,
[1884.52 --> 1888.04]  I've been trying some different medications for, am I frozen?
[1888.92 --> 1889.72]  Can you even hear me?
[1889.72 --> 1890.76]  I can hear you.
[1890.76 --> 1891.96]  You don't look frozen on my side.
[1891.96 --> 1893.32]  Okay, cool.
[1893.32 --> 1893.80]  Perfect.
[1893.80 --> 1895.08]  Well, that's really good.
[1895.08 --> 1896.44]  Cause I seem to be frozen here.
[1896.44 --> 1897.48]  So that's fine.
[1897.48 --> 1899.64]  Anyway, I think it's probably time to talk about it.
[1899.64 --> 1904.60]  I mean, I was very obviously not in a good headspace.
[1905.40 --> 1910.12]  Um, when I did my 10 million subscriber video a couple of years back now, I guess it was.
[1910.84 --> 1917.24]  And over the last little bit, I've been experimenting with some different mood altering,
[1917.96 --> 1920.04]  uh, pharmaceutical strategies.
[1920.84 --> 1927.56]  And I appear to be receiving a call or is that coming in through my,
[1927.56 --> 1930.84]  I think that I think that was coming into your headphones.
[1930.84 --> 1931.96]  I was receiving a call.
[1932.84 --> 1933.32]  Cool.
[1933.32 --> 1933.72]  All right.
[1933.72 --> 1933.80]  All right.
[1933.80 --> 1937.40]  So yeah, I've been trying a couple of strategies lately.
[1937.40 --> 1944.28]  And when you're weaning on and weaning off of these kinds of mood altering medications,
[1945.00 --> 1951.16]  it can be very, uh, you might not even feel like there's anything different.
[1951.16 --> 1955.56]  Uh, you might not even feel like there's anything wrong, but you can be,
[1956.52 --> 1957.80]  you can be a little off.
[1957.80 --> 1963.16]  Um, and I think I've been a little off for quite a while here.
[1963.16 --> 1970.84]  And so, you know, it's not an excuse, but you know, I realized it was really a problem when I like
[1971.40 --> 1977.96]  went off on a YouTube employee who happens to work on the mobile creator studio app team.
[1979.32 --> 1982.92]  Basically kind of, I said something along the lines of,
[1984.04 --> 1990.28]  I re I had a call with you guys 18 months ago where I walked through a lot of the issues with the
[1990.28 --> 1994.76]  changes that you guys kind of suddenly started making after ignoring this app for a very long
[1994.76 --> 1999.08]  time. So I kind of walked through some of the issues with the changes you were making some of
[1999.08 --> 2003.72]  the issues that have existed for a long time that you guys are not fixing. Um,
[2005.64 --> 2011.16]  and I feel like it's been completely ignored. And here are two more things that are either
[2011.16 --> 2015.80]  broken right now or that you appear to have intentionally broken. And I basically like flew
[2015.80 --> 2023.00]  off the handle. Um, I am very frustrated, but what I realized is that while my frustration is
[2023.00 --> 2029.88]  justified, the way that I am reacting to it is not justified. Right. So it's been,
[2031.24 --> 2034.04]  it's been a bit of a ride lately. I'm going to be honest with you.
[2034.04 --> 2035.88]  The people from the machine a little bit.
[2035.88 --> 2039.80]  Yeah. And like easily off ended millennial over in Twitch chats, like, yeah,
[2039.80 --> 2043.88]  the doctors treat you like a Guinea pig. Well, yeah, because you guys got to understand that,
[2043.88 --> 2049.16]  like these kinds of blockers or, you know, whether it's a blocker or whether it's a supplement,
[2049.16 --> 2055.16]  um, it is a highly experimental process to find something that works for the individual because
[2055.16 --> 2059.80]  everyone's body chemistry is a little different, which is just another way of saying, Hey, everybody's
[2059.80 --> 2065.24]  an individual. We're all different. Right. So yeah, it can be very challenging. Um, so the thing
[2065.24 --> 2070.44]  that I was really upset about with the creator studio app, I have actually, I have since uninstalled
[2070.44 --> 2078.20]  it because what I realized is that it's honestly just causing me, it's causing me grief to use a
[2078.20 --> 2084.68]  tool that it feels like every couple of months gets worse and the problems with it don't become
[2084.68 --> 2089.24]  better. And so why do I keep looking at it? Maybe it's just not healthy to be looking at the stats
[2089.24 --> 2093.64]  this often anyway. So I'm just going to switch to using the desktop creator studio, but the recent
[2093.64 --> 2100.60]  change that made me extremely angry was that they removed the subscriber change over the last 28 days
[2100.60 --> 2109.48]  from the homepage of the dashboard and replaced it with your memberships change. And it's like, Hey,
[2109.48 --> 2115.80]  can you guys please stop taking useful information that I need and hiding it away behind useless
[2115.80 --> 2121.40]  information that I don't need, which has been an ongoing pattern. I used to be able to see the likes and
[2121.40 --> 2127.00]  dislike counts for a video just in the content menu as I was scrolling by. So I could see like,
[2127.00 --> 2131.88]  Hey, how's sentiment doing on the last few videos? Just like kind of at a glance. And now to find the
[2131.88 --> 2140.04]  dislike count, I kid you not, you have to click on the video, click over onto analytics. Then you have to
[2140.04 --> 2146.44]  go to engagement. I think it is. It's either engagement or audience engagement. I think then you can see the
[2146.44 --> 2155.32]  ratio. So then you can open up, you can multitask, open up your YouTube viewer app, navigate to that
[2155.32 --> 2160.28]  video. Or I think from within the analytics, you can go back to that content and open it up in the
[2160.28 --> 2165.88]  YouTube player app from there. Either way, it's two actions. Then you can see the like count. So then you
[2165.88 --> 2171.00]  can open up your calculator, calculate it, and then you can finally get it. It's like this nine,
[2171.00 --> 2176.44]  10 step process where I just want to know what the sentiment is like on this video. So between,
[2177.48 --> 2183.96]  so they just keep hiding things away. And it's this, it's this slow and steady march towards reducing
[2183.96 --> 2195.16]  our access to the data that I feel like we need to help us do our jobs and adding features that are not,
[2195.16 --> 2201.64]  not, not, not, not useful from a, um, from my point of view anyway.
[2201.64 --> 2206.60]  Anyway, so I was, I was really frustrated and it's like, it's little things like YouTube has been
[2206.60 --> 2214.36]  eroding and eroding and eroding the data transparency of this platform the entire time that I've been on
[2214.36 --> 2219.96]  it. And they've been eroding and eroding and eroding creator control the entire time that I've been on it.
[2219.96 --> 2227.08]  And the fact that other creators aren't as frustrated as me is in itself really frustrating.
[2227.08 --> 2234.68]  Like why wasn't there absolute outrage when YouTube threatened social blade with legal action for
[2234.68 --> 2242.36]  holding more than 24 months of creator stats live on their site? You used to be able to go and find
[2242.36 --> 2248.04]  any channel and chart its rise and fall. And then you could go and you could like go onto the channel
[2248.04 --> 2251.32]  and you could look at, okay, what was the style of content when it started, when they started to
[2251.32 --> 2256.92]  decline? Like you could look and you could see big trends on the platform, like the rise and
[2256.92 --> 2262.44]  fall of pranks, for example, and you could, you could track this and you could, you could make
[2262.44 --> 2269.16]  decisions about how you want to run your business. And instead they're, they are hiding that away.
[2269.16 --> 2276.04]  They're hiding exact subscribe counts there. Uh, yeah, this is great. Uh, uh, who is this on, uh,
[2276.04 --> 2281.32]  Twitch chat? They, they hid estimated monetized playbacks from immediate view in the revenue tab.
[2281.32 --> 2287.88]  So you can see, you can see the way that the tide is going. And I just, I went off on someone who's
[2287.88 --> 2292.92]  not controlling it, to be honest with you. I think that this individual controls some of the things
[2292.92 --> 2298.44]  that I was upset about, but they certainly don't control all of them. The overall direction of the
[2298.44 --> 2306.92]  platform to be, I think really just more revenue focused and less YouTube, you know,
[2307.88 --> 2314.68]  is just very clear. And so I got really angry, not because it was so much work for me to go and see
[2314.68 --> 2320.28]  what the net subscriber change on my channel was in the last 28 days. I got so angry because the thing
[2320.28 --> 2328.04]  that what it was replaced with was this memberships stat that most people do not heavily use, but I can
[2328.04 --> 2335.72]  see the direction that we're going. And I'm just, I'm just so angry that we can't like, clearly the writing
[2335.72 --> 2343.64]  is on the wall for subscribing to a channel in general. You know, it already is just, you know,
[2343.64 --> 2350.84]  what, what they might call, um, an indicator, you know, or a marker. It's, it's just a data point.
[2350.84 --> 2358.28]  You know, it's not actually a subscription. Yeah. The bell helps. The bell's kind of the actual new
[2358.28 --> 2369.56]  subscription. Yes. The issue with the bell is that actually getting a notification every time
[2369.56 --> 2377.00]  a channel does anything is not necessarily the best. Yeah. And that might sound crazy coming from
[2377.00 --> 2381.48]  a YouTube creator. Like you would think, right. That obviously I would just want you to immediately
[2381.48 --> 2387.96]  drop everything you're doing and look at what I've done the second that it drops, but a notification
[2387.96 --> 2395.72]  in real time is not necessarily the best solution. Do you have any idea how few people actually click
[2395.72 --> 2401.80]  those notifications and immediately interact with the content? Oh, it's probably tiny. I, I, I want,
[2401.80 --> 2409.48]  I want you to guess, take a shot at it. 15. 15% of the people who get it. Yeah. That's your guess.
[2409.48 --> 2415.64]  That's the shot I'm taking. I have no idea at all. Let me see if I can find it. Okay. So here's a video,
[2415.64 --> 2422.92]  um, called, I want to love Apple, but they're making it hard. It has 2.6 million views from 2.1 million
[2422.92 --> 2437.32]  unique viewers. Okay. There were 974,000 bell notifications sent. Wow. We got, and I kid you not,
[2438.68 --> 2449.40]  uh, here it is 11,500 views from bell notifications. To be fair, I, I use bell notifications, but I don't
[2449.40 --> 2456.44]  watch YouTube on my phone. So like I'll get a notification for a channel, especially I, I will
[2456.44 --> 2463.32]  mostly bell notify on channels that upload extremely infrequently because I find that like, if I don't
[2463.32 --> 2466.84]  click on one of their videos, they're just gone forever. So I want to know when one of their videos
[2466.84 --> 2470.52]  come through, but I'll see the notification come in and then I'll bring it up on my computer. So that
[2470.52 --> 2476.60]  wouldn't count as a bell notification thing. I don't think, um, it's, it's really hard to track.
[2476.60 --> 2481.24]  Most people are not disciplined enough to see a bell notification and then like, remember to go
[2481.24 --> 2486.76]  look at it later. And that's a big part of the reason that Google has shifted from emphasizing
[2486.76 --> 2491.96]  subscribe and ring the bell to not. And the, here's the, here's the really scary part of that
[2491.96 --> 2498.20]  is if you're one of those people who has the bell rung, right. And you get that notification and you
[2498.20 --> 2502.92]  don't engage with it or you engage with it for five seconds and you're like, Oh, I'm at my bus stop.
[2502.92 --> 2510.52]  I got to go and you close it and you abandon it. That is actually a much stronger indicator
[2510.52 --> 2514.76]  for the platform that this is bad content that is going to affect the way that it gets served to the
[2514.76 --> 2519.96]  other. Oh, like that individual video. Cause they're like, Oh, you're 99.99. Oh, wow.
[2520.60 --> 2524.76]  It's going to make it less likely that I'm going to get be get to be served to other people.
[2524.76 --> 2528.92]  The bell notification is like, so, so here's the thing. I get it.
[2528.92 --> 2533.64]  I get why subscriptions have become the way that they have, because it's clear that the
[2533.64 --> 2541.32]  recommendation algorithm is so much more powerful and is clearly a better user experience, or at
[2541.32 --> 2549.96]  least a growing user experience compared to the old way. But I don't feel like it has to be replaced
[2549.96 --> 2556.92]  with memberships. You know, it's just, it's just very obvious that instead of YouTube being willing to
[2556.92 --> 2563.40]  lead and have its own identity as YouTube, it's just looking at other platforms, whether it's
[2563.40 --> 2569.24]  Twitter with their super follows or whether it's Twitch with their emphasis on live gaming,
[2569.24 --> 2574.76]  or whether it's tick talk with short form video, YouTube is just a copycat at this point. What's the
[2574.76 --> 2581.64]  last thing YouTube has done that has been a clear differentiating move that has been, that has
[2581.64 --> 2586.20]  demonstrated leadership in the online video space. Tell me something.
[2586.20 --> 2588.20]  Yeah, I mean, I can't think of anything.
[2588.20 --> 2590.36]  Well, I want to hear from the chat.
[2590.36 --> 2594.20]  They initialized all of it. Yeah, sure. I doubt they're going to be able to say anything either.
[2595.00 --> 2601.40]  Tell me something YouTube has innovated, guys. And so that's why I'm so frustrated. I rely on this
[2601.40 --> 2607.96]  platform. And you know what, maybe our relationship is not perfect. But I think there's a part of me that
[2607.96 --> 2612.92]  loves it. Right? Like it has changed my life. And I believe the world for the better.
[2615.00 --> 2623.80]  So guys, can we stop it up, please? And so yeah, I got I got real passionate about it. I got really
[2623.80 --> 2630.52]  angry. Because I saw I saw, you know, basically, I couldn't even read comments. It was completely bugged
[2630.52 --> 2635.08]  on my device or my account. I don't know what the issue was. But I can only see like six or seven
[2635.08 --> 2639.48]  comments on a video, I had to go out to the player app for that. 18 months ago, I said, Hey,
[2639.48 --> 2644.28]  there's still no way to see any kinds of stats or interact with people for stories in the Creator
[2644.28 --> 2650.20]  Studio app. I shouldn't have to go to the viewer app to create that doesn't make sense. And they were
[2650.20 --> 2654.04]  like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is like great feedback. And then they sat and did nothing,
[2654.60 --> 2662.76]  removed the ability to meaningfully compare data, period over period. Now all I have is this like,
[2662.76 --> 2668.92]  Oh, this is how good it is compared to normal. Even though I showed them, I used actual data from
[2668.92 --> 2675.48]  my own channel, when I had a six month decline, where everyone, partner manager, other contacts
[2675.48 --> 2680.12]  that I had at YouTube, my dashboard were like, this is normal, this is normal, this is normal,
[2680.12 --> 2685.24]  because it's this rolling, it looks at your rolling average over the last little bit. And so if you're
[2685.24 --> 2693.56]  down 10% a month for six months, you could be down 60% with it telling you it's normal, the whole
[2694.52 --> 2700.76]  time. And I'm like, No, this is not useful. I need to be able to track period over period, so I can see
[2700.76 --> 2706.60]  how things are going. And it's like, it's this constant, it's this constant march towards feeling
[2706.60 --> 2710.92]  better. And I'm like, You know what, my mental health is not better. When you tell me everything
[2710.92 --> 2717.48]  is good. And everyone likes your videos. And then people stop watching them. And all of a sudden,
[2717.48 --> 2721.48]  I'm not making a living anymore. That's not going to be good for anyone's mental health. Oh, man,
[2721.48 --> 2725.24]  now I'm going off on it again. I was gonna say, I think you're I think you're starting to pop off.
[2725.24 --> 2730.84]  The there was some some examples that came up in in flow plane chat that I don't 100% know if
[2730.84 --> 2736.76]  they're legit or not. But chapters, the one that someone brought up. Yeah, chapters, chapters are
[2736.76 --> 2743.16]  restoring functionality they broke nine years ago. We used to have annotations. We used to have
[2743.16 --> 2748.76]  annotations. So you can actually create like, we used to do it. Remember, the new version of the
[2748.76 --> 2753.88]  DVD menu screen with chapters. Now the current implementation is better. But my god, that
[2753.88 --> 2758.04]  shouldn't have taken eight years. And then a fun, spicy one that I'll just throw out there is removing
[2758.04 --> 2764.84]  the dislike button. That was that was innovation, dude. Sometimes innovation is taking things away.
[2764.84 --> 2770.76]  Okay, that's following again. All they did was follow other platforms that don't have dislikes.
[2770.76 --> 2775.16]  Yeah, well, plain chat guys, you guys are going to start getting timeouts. If you're going to keep
[2775.16 --> 2779.16]  talking about vaccine crap, just cut it out. Yeah. All right, there you go.
[2780.20 --> 2786.12]  Um, yeah, so I'm frustrated. And people are like, oh, millionaire problems. Yeah,
[2786.12 --> 2793.56]  they're millionaire problems for people who have 65 mouths to feed. I can't have my tools like,
[2793.56 --> 2800.68]  imagine, imagine you're a trades, a trades worker, right? Okay. And every day you leave the job site,
[2800.68 --> 2804.60]  the homeowner comes and moves your tools around or like breaks them.
[2807.00 --> 2812.12]  I'm just trying to do my job or randomly like adds a restriction. You can't use this tool anymore.
[2812.68 --> 2818.28]  You know, or you can use it. But but you have to do a special dance before you use it that takes 30 seconds.
[2818.28 --> 2825.48]  Yeah. You can only use nails that you purchased within the last 12 months, any nails that are over
[2825.48 --> 2831.64]  12 months old are not allowed to be used. So yeah, I was I was really frustrated. And I was really angry.
[2831.64 --> 2841.40]  But how angry I was and how I acted really opened my eyes to how I have not been level headed. And I think
[2841.40 --> 2848.52]  as this leads really well, back into the last couple of weeks where we've discussed one Mr. Musk.
[2849.32 --> 2858.44]  So bottom line is, you know, I think that the the the messaging around the attempt to purchase Twitter,
[2858.44 --> 2862.76]  which may actually go through from how it's looking right now. Yeah, I think the messaging of
[2863.32 --> 2868.60]  I will save it, I will be the hero for free speech that the world needs. No, these are not direct quotes,
[2868.60 --> 2876.28]  but I think the sentiment is pretty clear. I think it shows a narcissistic personality with a messiah
[2876.28 --> 2884.04]  complex. And there's enough there's enough. There's enough information about this particular
[2884.04 --> 2891.80]  individual that contradicts some kind of grand, noble goal towards improving free speech in the world,
[2891.80 --> 2897.08]  that honestly, it's just offensive to me that anyone even believes it for a second, you know.
[2899.96 --> 2905.96]  And the reality of it is that my head's not been quite on straight. And I went and I started drawing
[2905.96 --> 2912.52]  comparisons. Because I like I read a ton. And I don't always get every detail right. And the way
[2912.52 --> 2916.76]  that my memory works is like highly associated, like I will see I'll see a spoon, and I'll be like,
[2916.76 --> 2921.80]  oh, yeah, that one spoon that doesn't match. I remember where we got it. Like, that's just like
[2921.80 --> 2927.64]  the I just I make jumps, I make jumps, I make connections. And so, you know, this is this was
[2927.64 --> 2937.24]  this is a character that I find the fact that there's this there's this worship of this particular
[2937.24 --> 2944.60]  character, who has made a lot of not just mistakes, but in my opinion, a lot of moves that
[2944.60 --> 2948.44]  demonstrate a character that I personally am not
[2950.76 --> 2956.84]  I don't think is great there. That's what I'll say that I just I'm you know, what I did is I just
[2956.84 --> 2962.36]  I started I started going off. And I started taking things that were actually to do with, you know, other
[2962.36 --> 2969.56]  billionaires that people worship for reasons that think are do not overcome the problems with these people or
[2970.12 --> 2974.52]  anecdotes that I had heard or things that I read three years ago, and I don't remember all the details
[2974.52 --> 2980.68]  of. And so last week, there was an attempt made to kind of set the record straight. Honestly, I didn't
[2980.68 --> 2986.44]  do a good job then either. So this week, here's what I'm going to say, I'm going to keep it really simple.
[2987.00 --> 2993.80]  We had we had the writing team put together a list of you know, things that I either got wrong or were
[2993.80 --> 2999.96]  based on hearsay. And I just want to I just want to clear it up. Okay. So the claim was that Musk was not
[2999.96 --> 3006.92]  not the original founder of Tesla. Tesla was founded by Mark Eberhard and Mark Tarpening in 2003.
[3007.80 --> 3015.64]  Elon Musk was an early investor in 2004. Okay, he was the lead of the first round of investments,
[3015.64 --> 3024.20]  as far as my understanding. Correct. Yeah. So there was some fighting about that founder title. I think I
[3024.20 --> 3029.56]  had gotten wrong, who sued who. Bottom line is,
[3033.16 --> 3041.08]  founder, in my opinion, is you can just be CEO. Why do you need to be founder when you literally
[3041.08 --> 3049.72]  didn't found something? You could make the argument that you were foundational, you know, or whatever.
[3049.72 --> 3057.56]  To me, it's a it's a it's a silly thing. It's a it's an ego thing. I don't think it's I don't think it
[3057.56 --> 3065.80]  it reflects someone who is healthy to get kind of hung up on details like that. And who was right and who
[3065.80 --> 3071.72]  was wrong with respect to the the lawsuit and the argument about it. I've got an entire page on it.
[3071.72 --> 3076.76]  Honestly, I'm not going to read the whole thing to you guys, because I just it doesn't matter. The point is
[3076.76 --> 3085.24]  that I said some stuff that wasn't quite accurate. Okay, but it's also just factually correct that
[3085.24 --> 3093.24]  Mr. Musk did not found Tesla in the sense that we would think of founding. Yeah, I tried to look up
[3093.24 --> 3099.16]  like what the media group. Yeah, I tried to look up like what the what the definition of that was.
[3099.16 --> 3104.76]  And sometimes to be fair, it does get a little vague, especially when it comes into
[3105.64 --> 3111.08]  when when people start opening things up for these investment rounds and stuff.
[3111.08 --> 3115.72]  Yeah, it has definitely happened before where extremely early investors get
[3116.20 --> 3122.12]  labeled as founders. I don't know if that's normal. But yeah, he wasn't like one of the
[3122.12 --> 3131.08]  the literal initial OG people. Yeah. So but you know what, maybe from his point of view,
[3131.08 --> 3137.64]  he feels like he should be because they wouldn't have gotten anywhere without him. So that's why I'm
[3137.64 --> 3143.72]  just saying like, yeah, here's where here's where I got the idea from. It's not actually technically
[3143.72 --> 3150.76]  wrong in that sense. But yeah, maybe he has an argument to I no longer care. I've moved on.
[3152.20 --> 3158.84]  Honestly, it was just I went back and I rewatched the clip like my brain was going two steps ahead
[3158.84 --> 3166.92]  and my mouth was way back here. The thing with the whole like family treatment. Really, I was talking
[3166.92 --> 3173.40]  about choosing better heroes. And the person who was really horrible to their family was Steve Jobs.
[3173.40 --> 3180.92]  That's not really open for debate. Guy was like not a good guy. Yeah, as far as treatment of family goes.
[3183.16 --> 3190.52]  Now, this is all hearsay. But according to previous spouses, Elon's track record ain't perfect.
[3191.72 --> 3197.00]  Okay, that's that's all I'll say. Just to be clear, this is previous spouse, right? This is an
[3197.00 --> 3203.96]  one person. Yes. Yeah. Well, two spouses crimes allegations of like poor living conditions.
[3204.52 --> 3211.48]  When I own admission. This is great. He lives very frugally, but he allows himself this one luxury
[3211.48 --> 3217.48]  of a private jet. But yeah. Yeah, I mean, the stuff she was complaining about was like,
[3218.28 --> 3222.76]  they're only being like peanut butter. So isn't she like super rich to because she buy her own food?
[3222.76 --> 3230.04]  Um, so it depends. I'm not going to pretend to understand their relationship dynamic because I was
[3230.04 --> 3236.84]  not there. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Sorry, go for it. Maybe she
[3236.84 --> 3245.64]  could buy a new mattress. Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know. So I'm so that's it. So I have definitely I have
[3245.64 --> 3253.48]  definitely seen bits that give me reason to believe that he's not the kind of father that I want to be.
[3254.04 --> 3259.08]  Um, there's a there's a bit about how during the first part of an infant's life, the kid doesn't
[3259.08 --> 3265.24]  really need him. So Grimes is doing all the work. And I'm sitting here going, uh, right, but like,
[3265.24 --> 3269.56]  it's, did it occur to you for four seconds that it might not be actually about the infant?
[3269.56 --> 3275.08]  Um, like being helpful. Like, you know, I just like I read stuff like that. And it's just like,
[3275.08 --> 3281.56]  clearly, he just doesn't have a clue. Right. Um, and so, you know, no, I don't have anything
[3281.56 --> 3288.84]  concrete, but my vibe ain't great. So I'm still there. But I'm also, you know, I'm not gonna make
[3288.84 --> 3293.80]  any kind of assertations. Um, as for the claim that Tesla dissolved their PR department, I don't
[3293.80 --> 3299.32]  really know why there's any debate about this. They, they, they confirmed it, we no longer have a
[3299.32 --> 3307.32]  PR team. And the fact that anyone thinks that that is defensible is terrifying to me. It's
[3307.32 --> 3315.48]  absolutely terrifying to me to think that corporations should just not have to answer
[3315.48 --> 3319.32]  questions and should just decide they're just simply not going to answer questions anymore.
[3319.32 --> 3328.76]  Here's a potential flip. Uh, there's, there's no official PR team for LTT store. Like I can think
[3328.76 --> 3335.00]  of a lot of places that sell things. You can go on linusmediagroup.com and we have an email
[3335.00 --> 3339.80]  called info at linusmediagroup.com that you can contact and ask a question. Of course, we have a
[3339.80 --> 3349.16]  forward facing way to talk to us. Yeah. I mean, there's a way to talk to Tesla as well. They didn't
[3349.16 --> 3354.12]  just dissolve the PR team. They made it so you actually cannot reach them. You can tag Elon on
[3354.12 --> 3359.80]  Twitter and hope you get a response. Yeah. Like that is not, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's like
[3359.80 --> 3367.80]  actually not acceptable, especially for something where safety is such an enormous factor. Something
[3367.80 --> 3377.16]  where the costs for the customer are so high that when, you know, when, when a customer has a roof,
[3377.16 --> 3382.28]  fly off the vehicle because of your shoddy quality control on the way home from the factory,
[3382.28 --> 3388.36]  allegedly, allegedly, you need to answer questions about that. People could have died.
[3388.36 --> 3393.24]  This isn't just like some media company where you might be like, Hey, what brand of underarm
[3393.24 --> 3398.20]  deodorant does Linus use? Because Ed referred to it as cheap and I don't want to smell cheap.
[3398.20 --> 3402.60]  You know, that's the kind of questions people might ask us. We don't, we don't make life and death
[3402.60 --> 3405.48]  products. So it looks like they have press at Tesla.com.
[3405.48 --> 3411.80]  So they literally dissolved their PR department. So what does that mean?
[3411.80 --> 3418.44]  I don't know. Like the, the thing that you brought up was that there's no way to contact them. Right.
[3418.44 --> 3422.76]  But they, I mean, they have a contact. Oh, do they just not reply to it?
[3422.76 --> 3429.32]  I don't know. There's press at Tesla.com. There's EU press at Tesla.com. There's APAC
[3429.32 --> 3433.56]  press at Tesla.com and there's China dash press at Tesla.com.
[3435.16 --> 3439.72]  So electric can confirm Tesla has dissolved its PR department,
[3439.72 --> 3443.08]  technically becoming the first automaker who doesn't talk to the press.
[3444.20 --> 3445.16]  They have press emails.
[3449.16 --> 3454.44]  Hold on a second. AC here. We had a contact there. They told us they won't talk to us anymore. Yeah.
[3454.44 --> 3458.60]  So actually we've experienced it firsthand. I don't just have to take Electrex word for it.
[3460.36 --> 3462.92]  A prime says, does Apple talk to us though? Uh,
[3462.92 --> 3467.72]  Apple is also an astonishingly arrogant company with a really bad attitude.
[3469.64 --> 3470.12]  Fair enough.
[3471.72 --> 3476.60]  Apple like Tesla talks only to whoever they want to talk when they want to talk.
[3477.48 --> 3482.36]  Like I, I, I, what do you, what do you want me to say? I mean, saying like, oh, Apple,
[3482.36 --> 3490.68]  Apple does it too. Is like, okay. Yeah. And what's interesting is Apple did have press contacts
[3490.68 --> 3494.60]  for us all of a sudden when they needed something. And as soon as they didn't need anything,
[3494.60 --> 3500.68]  they took off again. I'm sure Tesla would be the same way. I there's, there's, I can't help but
[3500.68 --> 3505.56]  think that a very large amount of companies. And our Stanley says the press emails go unanswered.
[3505.56 --> 3510.36]  Okay. So there you go. Okay. Well, I, I can't imagine there isn't a large amount of companies
[3510.36 --> 3515.08]  that are very selective about what press emails they respond to. Um, I don't know if you remember
[3515.08 --> 3522.76]  back in the day, but even when, even when Oculus was a part of Facebook, um, it was actually
[3522.76 --> 3528.52]  impossible for us to talk to them, uh, until I started just like harassing Palmer lucky directly.
[3528.52 --> 3535.64]  And then we were able to get responses. Um, so the problem with this and the reason that I brought it
[3535.64 --> 3541.56]  up was not necessarily to say that there's no one else who effectively doesn't have a press relations
[3541.56 --> 3546.76]  department or who just considers themselves above answering questions. Cause really that's the
[3546.76 --> 3551.72]  attitude that we're showing here. The reason I brought it up is because it does demonstrate an
[3551.72 --> 3560.12]  arrogance and a belief that you simply aren't accountable. Um, and it was while we were discussing
[3560.12 --> 3566.84]  that Elon is supposed to be some kind of, uh, some kind of free speech, um, some kind of,
[3569.16 --> 3577.80]  some kind of like paragon of, and you know what? Yeah. Transparency, I guess is not technically
[3577.80 --> 3584.84]  free speech, but from my point of view, they're both foundational pillars of a free society,
[3584.84 --> 3593.32]  I guess is what I will say. And so what I did was again, my brain was two steps ahead of my mouth
[3593.32 --> 3597.72]  and I was making these connections and that's why I brought it up, which is why it made no sense.
[3600.28 --> 3604.60]  Selvar said Elon dissolved their PR because he felt it was a pointless cost as it didn't shift their rep at
[3604.60 --> 3613.72]  all. Right. Because their rep was bad because they kept doing stupid stuff and having like bad QC and kept
[3613.72 --> 3619.24]  having scandals. Now there have been times that I think that traditional automaker press has unfairly
[3619.24 --> 3626.92]  targeted Tesla. That's a fair criticism. Extremely. Yeah. And lots of other groups as well. He's, he's a very, uh,
[3629.32 --> 3635.00]  I've actually been wondering how to phrase this over the last couple of days. He's a very, uh, conflict is
[3635.00 --> 3643.16]  very heavy when it around him, both in like support and, uh, attack. Like I can't think of all that many
[3643.16 --> 3650.44]  other people who have had companies out there that are so public and so welcomed by so many people.
[3650.44 --> 3657.56]  And then you have like people showing up to the Tesla superchargers and like parking, um, internal
[3657.56 --> 3663.96]  combustion engine cars in the spots, uh, and like trying to like freak people out so that they'll
[3663.96 --> 3669.64]  leave the area. And like, oh, like it's, it's extremely, extremely contentious. Um, and it's,
[3669.64 --> 3679.24]  it's kind of hard to find articles, a balanced take. Yeah. And we kind of added to that problem.
[3679.24 --> 3684.52]  Um, but it's, but it didn't help. No, but it's, it's very hard. Like I, I tried to do some research
[3684.52 --> 3690.60]  on a, on a few of these things myself, um, and diving into quite a few of them. I was like, wow,
[3690.60 --> 3697.24]  I really can't find anything that isn't extremely heavily editorialized. Um, one way or the other.
[3697.24 --> 3703.40]  Yeah. Like just it's, it's, yeah, it's pretty, but if we just, if we slow down and look at the
[3703.40 --> 3709.16]  actions, right. Um, Alex Clark is, is kind of mad in the, uh, flow plane chat right now. He's like,
[3709.16 --> 3715.00]  Hey, there's also the whole suing top gear thing. Yeah. Suing, suing independent media is like,
[3715.00 --> 3720.84]  not cool, by the way. Um, yeah, they're not, they're not, they don't have to say nice things
[3720.84 --> 3725.40]  about you. You can not work with them again, by all means. And you don't have to report to their emails.
[3725.40 --> 3729.56]  What did he sue them for? Uh, he sued them. I forget what the, you know, I don't want to say,
[3729.56 --> 3732.84]  I don't remember the exact details. Didn't they fake some stuff? Wasn't that actually like,
[3733.56 --> 3737.40]  no, he tossed, apparently a judge tossed it out. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah.
[3737.40 --> 3746.12]  Who knows? Um, okay. So then, you know, other things we talked about must pumping up Dogecoin.
[3746.12 --> 3752.52]  I mean, please, anyone who's going to argue that that was a thing or was not a thing. Excuse me.
[3753.08 --> 3759.32]  Come on. One thing we got definitely wrong was, uh, the Starlink aid to Ukraine, Tesla,
[3760.20 --> 3766.44]  SpaceX covered a significant portion of that. And that's actually a lot. Yeah. A plus good. Now,
[3767.16 --> 3774.12]  now you can get into a much bigger conversation around, um, uh, uh, oh man, what's, what's it called?
[3774.84 --> 3780.20]  When you like whitewash your image or greenwash your image through like a, a just like negligible
[3780.20 --> 3785.48]  amount of philanthropy compared to your wealth. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We could talk about that.
[3785.48 --> 3790.92]  But at the end of the day, Starlink is a really important product. I mean, yeah, you have to be,
[3790.92 --> 3795.08]  you have to be an enormous good for the world. Yeah. Agreed. And I'm,
[3795.08 --> 3800.68]  I'm happy that they're there that they're doing that here. And I'm sure to a certain degree,
[3801.56 --> 3806.84]  it's going to act as an advertising piece because they're showing like, look, even in a crazy conflict
[3806.84 --> 3811.16]  zone, it's working. And like, it's really helpful for people. And like, when all the other infrastructure
[3811.16 --> 3815.40]  is failing, this is working, like, that's obviously a fantastic advertising piece. And I'm sure there
[3815.40 --> 3821.48]  was at least a little bit of motivation to do that. Um, but like, it's a little bit of a,
[3821.48 --> 3827.88]  an interesting path to go down. Um, when to, to try to say like, oh, it's, it's,
[3827.88 --> 3835.56]  I don't know using it, that as a negative thing, I don't think is fair at all. He was asked for it
[3835.56 --> 3840.92]  and he supplied it. Yep. It's similar to, it's similar to a few other things in this doc where
[3840.92 --> 3846.68]  people are like, oh, like he, he did this thing and it like, wasn't exactly the way that I would
[3846.68 --> 3850.36]  like it to have been done. And it's like, well, he was asked for this thing and he supplied it.
[3850.36 --> 3854.68]  Yeah. Yeah. Like the, like, uh, they provided what they were asked for. So, you know what,
[3854.68 --> 3861.16]  that's something I got wrong. I, I managed to get misled by editorialized content about that
[3861.16 --> 3866.68]  whole saga and I'm sorry. And then when people yelled at him about the ventilator thing,
[3866.68 --> 3872.60]  because apparently it did end up being not helpful, even though at least he claims it was what was asked
[3872.60 --> 3878.36]  for. Um, they turned around and after that they, they worked with a company that produces the correct
[3878.36 --> 3884.36]  ventilators and they helped them like SpaceX apparently, uh, was like one of the few companies
[3884.36 --> 3888.84]  that could actually produce the valves that they needed for the ventilators. And SpaceX produced a
[3888.84 --> 3893.96]  huge amount of the valves, which was the most complicated component for making the ventilators
[3893.96 --> 3898.36]  for this company that makes the correct ventilators so that they could produce significantly more than
[3898.36 --> 3903.16]  they would have otherwise been able to. And that like, doesn't get any coverage. Um, which again,
[3903.16 --> 3907.64]  I'm not trying to like be the weird nerd that dives in front of Elon to defend him.
[3907.64 --> 3913.40]  Cause I don't think he needs it at all. Um, I have, I am in no way interested in coming to the
[3913.40 --> 3917.00]  defense of billionaires and you should know that if you've watched this show before, but I do want
[3917.00 --> 3921.40]  the attacks to be accurate and correct. And I think there is things to go after properly. And I think
[3921.40 --> 3926.44]  that should be all that is done. Zypher says double standard much. He just finished telling float
[3926.44 --> 3929.40]  plane users to stop talking about a certain something. And now he's saying that independent
[3929.40 --> 3933.00]  media can talk about whatever they want, which is it? Question mark, exclamation mark.
[3933.00 --> 3938.28]  Uh, there was a flame war. Uh, people were violating the terms of service of the website by
[3938.28 --> 3943.72]  personally attacking each other. Yeah. So yeah, that there's, there's a distinction there,
[3943.72 --> 3953.00]  but you don't know that because you're not a float plane elite. So enjoy, enjoy YouTube chat or don't.
[3954.44 --> 3960.20]  Um, what else we got? Yeah, we got not disclosing the stake in Twitter. I've got people wondering why that
[3960.20 --> 3965.40]  mattered. It mattered because it was illegal. That's why it mattered. Well, if you, if you are
[3965.40 --> 3973.96]  a large public figure and you are hastily grabbing shares in a single company, um, making that public
[3973.96 --> 3979.16]  will drive the cost of those shares up significantly. And it is apparently, I don't know a lot about this
[3979.16 --> 3983.48]  type of stuff, but it is apparently the law that you were supposed to do that. Um, and he didn't,
[3983.48 --> 3990.52]  if you reach a 5% threshold. Okay, sure. Yeah. I don't know a lot about this stuff. Um, but, but that
[3990.52 --> 3995.96]  would like, if people will see like, Oh, Musk is investing a bunch in Twitter, a bunch of people are
[3995.96 --> 4000.60]  going to also try to do that. And it's going to drive the cost up. And if he does not disclose that,
[4000.60 --> 4006.76]  and people do not know that it will at least somewhat aid in keeping the cost, uh, similar to what
[4006.76 --> 4015.64]  it was when he first started buying. So he illegally, um, suppressed the value of shares
[4015.64 --> 4021.08]  that other people unknowingly sold, even though legally there was supposed to be a disclosure
[4021.08 --> 4029.08]  that probably would have driven up the price of those shares. So basically, um, it was an example of
[4029.08 --> 4035.24]  what I consider to be extraordinarily unethical behavior and acting in self-interest. Um,
[4035.24 --> 4040.92]  that is a, has been a pattern, whether it's Dogecoin or whether it's buying Twitter shares.
[4040.92 --> 4047.80]  Um, I'm not impressed and I don't have to be because illegally manipulating stock prices
[4048.52 --> 4053.32]  is illegal. So there's that. Yeah. All right.
[4056.44 --> 4061.88]  Are a prime and Alex arguing in float plane chat? You guys better not be.
[4061.88 --> 4065.24]  I don't, I don't do one though. I'm not sure. Okay.
[4067.96 --> 4070.92]  Um, what were we going to say? Okay. So there was the whole pedo guy,
[4070.92 --> 4075.96]  Thai cave rescue thing. You know what? I'm just going to say that was way more complicated than we
[4075.96 --> 4081.48]  gave it credit for. Yep. So sorry. I'm just never going to talk about it again, unless I like
[4081.48 --> 4086.36]  literally hire a dedicated person to go in and dig up every, everything about it. Yeah.
[4086.36 --> 4089.64]  Yeah. I have to dive through the court case and like do all this. Yeah. It's a lot.
[4091.32 --> 4097.96]  Okay. And there's nothing in here about right to repair. Tesla is a horrible, horrible company
[4097.96 --> 4103.00]  when it comes to right to repair. And that comes straight from the top. Uh, that, that much is just
[4103.00 --> 4111.00]  very clear. So I do not like, and man, I was, I was criticized for having a very us versus them
[4111.00 --> 4116.76]  attitude about it as though it's like, it's like us versus them. And I was also criticized for being
[4116.76 --> 4121.96]  an elite while criticizing the elite. But I think the thing you guys got to understand is that it is
[4121.96 --> 4129.40]  us versus them when them do stuff that makes life worse for us. And when I mean them and us,
[4129.40 --> 4135.64]  I mean the people who make the cars, we are talking billionaires and people who buy them. Yes. I am a
[4135.64 --> 4144.76]  millionaire. I mean, like, obviously like there, there are sites you can go on to see, like,
[4144.76 --> 4154.92]  it's just common sense. We have 65 full-time employees. I am clearly, uh, hold on a second.
[4154.92 --> 4160.52]  Greg Schneider spent a hundred dollars to send this super chat. I watch every video and tell people to,
[4160.52 --> 4164.92]  I buy merch first video where Linus is getting political enough to make me consider stopping.
[4164.92 --> 4171.24]  Just sad, stick to tech and don't create division. What? What was political here?
[4173.24 --> 4177.96]  Most of the show has been political is a, is an interesting term these days.
[4179.00 --> 4185.96]  I think it gets used for a lot of things, but most, a lot of the show so far has been, um, about very,
[4186.76 --> 4187.88]  line dividing topics.
[4187.88 --> 4199.72]  Uh, okay. I like, I don't know what to tell you. Someone elevating themselves to the detriment of
[4199.72 --> 4208.44]  other people shouldn't divide people down a political line. That's just bad. I don't care if your name is
[4208.44 --> 4215.96]  Elon Musk or Donald Trump or Nancy Pelosi. It doesn't matter. If you are engaging in unethical behavior that
[4215.96 --> 4222.44]  enriches yourself at the cost of the general public, that's bad. Anyway, the point is, yes,
[4222.44 --> 4228.20]  I'm a millionaire. You can find that out very easily. Google is your friend, but I am not,
[4228.20 --> 4235.48]  I am not influential in the same way that the, the wealthy elite are. I can't, I can't change policy.
[4235.48 --> 4243.32]  We're talking me compared to a person who can change policy by just changing the policy.
[4244.04 --> 4251.00]  Tesla's stance on right to repair could change tomorrow with a tweet. I don't have that kind of
[4251.00 --> 4260.92]  power. So yeah, it's us versus them because I'm not on that side. Uh, I think the last thing that we
[4260.92 --> 4268.84]  have left is, uh, no, I guess that's it. Oh, okay. There was the whole thing. Someone wrote an
[4268.84 --> 4273.16]  article claim. Someone wrote an article Musk didn't like. And as he had pre-purchased a Model X,
[4273.80 --> 4281.72]  Musk took it upon himself to cancel the order. Um, basically Musk's take on this, which is still up
[4281.72 --> 4287.08]  on Twitter from February 3rd, 2016, must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer
[4287.08 --> 4295.48]  gets this much attention. I mean, I don't think it's necessarily, um, just rudeness to be upset
[4295.48 --> 4301.00]  about the way that the launch of the Model X was handled. If you gave a $5,000 deposit, I think
[4301.00 --> 4312.36]  characterizing something like that as being rude, um, is dismissive. Um, but yeah, so there you go.
[4312.36 --> 4318.84]  I am sorry for anything I said that was not factually correct. And I'm just not going to
[4318.84 --> 4326.48]  talk about it anymore. Yeah. We're done now. Yeah. Yeah. Let's be, let's be, let's be done.
[4326.62 --> 4333.74]  Let's be done. All right. Speaking of done creates speaking of done. Oh, speaking of done,
[4334.04 --> 4339.68]  we are done launching. Do you have your screen share up? We are done launching a whopping,
[4339.68 --> 4345.04]  how many freaking new colors of water bottles do we have? Because these things are awesome.
[4345.28 --> 4352.16]  And I got to say mad props to Nick and the rest of the creator warehouse team, because wow,
[4352.32 --> 4359.44]  the names for them are just outstanding. I mean, we spent so long. Okay. Coming up with
[4359.44 --> 4365.18]  the best names we've got, we've got 12 AM green. Luke, are you screen sharing? Yeah.
[4365.18 --> 4369.08]  Am I just not able to see it? Uh, okay. Do you want to show them the 10 new colors?
[4369.48 --> 4372.86]  Yeah. New colors of water bottles. I'm going through it. We got, we got hero,
[4373.46 --> 4379.40]  which is like purple and green, uh, sand storm, which is a, it reminds me of like a,
[4379.46 --> 4384.56]  like a mocha colored or like a, like a coffee, uh, color there's circuit, which is green.
[4384.62 --> 4388.52]  Makes sense. Also it has golden circuitry. That looks really cool. Actually. Uh, night,
[4388.66 --> 4393.18]  which looks like it's purple with, uh, with yellow. Oh, they say they do not see anything.
[4393.18 --> 4399.90]  Luke, you are not screen sharing. Oh, you're on studio mode. So you got to push that. There
[4399.90 --> 4403.62]  should be one of those buttons. I'm a little blind, but one of those buttons should be to
[4403.62 --> 4409.74]  make that the live scene instead of the studio scene. Hey, there we go. Okay. I'm going to go
[4409.74 --> 4414.58]  back through it again. This is hero purple and green. There's a story behind that. By the way,
[4414.98 --> 4422.34]  my mom made me a, uh, green and purple cape when I was a child. Okay. Um, and that's green and purple.
[4423.90 --> 4428.58]  Yeah. Makes sense. It made me for some reason think of teenage mutant Ninja turtle. So I wasn't
[4428.58 --> 4432.22]  sure why though. Uh, this is the one that made me think of coffee. This one's called sandstorm.
[4432.22 --> 4438.94]  Cool. Uh, there's circuit, which is, I mean, green with gold makes sense. Yep. Sounds good. Uh,
[4438.94 --> 4446.78]  night is like a purple and yellow. H two O two makes sense. White background, blue printing.
[4446.78 --> 4457.10]  12 AM green looks very like army drab blueberry pie. That's actually, that's a very funky combo.
[4457.10 --> 4462.78]  I have the, I have the, the hero one. Um, but they're all kind of, they're all here on the table
[4462.78 --> 4470.70]  in front of me. Um, cream scream, uh, looks like an almost like day theme line of tech tips colors.
[4471.26 --> 4477.50]  Uh, sunrise blue and pink. Violet scream is, uh, cause we didn't want to get like,
[4477.50 --> 4482.46]  we didn't want to infringe anyone's trademark. Get it? Cream scream, white and orange.
[4483.42 --> 4490.38]  Oh, okay. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Not just like a violent climax.
[4490.38 --> 4500.06]  Light and black. I think it's pretty classic. Um, black and gold. Yeah. Okay. So we're getting
[4500.06 --> 4506.70]  into the, the, the, we can go back. So I lied. Um, the names were actually just like come up with,
[4506.70 --> 4512.70]  Oh no, you missed blueberry pie. Did I, I think so. I don't think so. Blueberry pie looks amazing.
[4512.70 --> 4516.62]  It's purple and light blue. Yeah. I think I just didn't say it, but I showed it on the screen.
[4516.62 --> 4519.58]  Cool. Yeah. Uh, so Nick came up with these names in like two minutes.
[4519.58 --> 4525.42]  Oh, well they're good. So good job, Nick. Yeah. I think I came up with hero and we worked together
[4525.42 --> 4529.98]  on cream scream, but other than that, yeah, Nick just like came up with it. Uh, but they're there
[4529.98 --> 4536.14]  guys go check them out. Let's talk some tech news. Shall we? Yes. Dell creates a proprietary
[4536.14 --> 4544.06]  DDR five connector and my spicy take on this before we even get any further into it is maybe that's not
[4544.06 --> 4549.50]  actually a terrible thing. All right. Now this was written by Anthony and I think
[4549.50 --> 4558.46]  he's editorialized a little bit in here, but I just a little bit. Oh, wait, under embargo.
[4558.94 --> 4564.86]  Wait. Huh? Oh shoot. Alex added some notes here that may or may not be under embargo. We just might
[4564.86 --> 4570.54]  not be able to talk about this yet this week. I, oh, it's late, but, um, I've seen him in the chat
[4570.54 --> 4577.18]  anyway, so I'm just gonna call him. This is why I started watching. Fair enough. Terrible boss.
[4578.94 --> 4584.86]  Oh, okay. This is why I started watching. Oh, okay. Um, hi, Mr. Clark.
[4585.74 --> 4589.74]  Yes. So am I allowed to say the things you said or no?
[4589.74 --> 4596.86]  Yes. I've taken everything that's in there and like the stuff that I can't say is not in there.
[4596.86 --> 4598.38]  Okay, cool. So it's sanitized.
[4598.38 --> 4600.94]  Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Sweet.
[4600.94 --> 4605.66]  A lot, a lot more. Okay, cool. I'm excited. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Bye.
[4607.10 --> 4610.86]  Okay. Oh, love that guy. Okay. So we're allowed to say everything that's in here.
[4610.86 --> 4617.90]  Dell, a company once famous for its proprietary components, has once again created a novel way
[4617.90 --> 4623.42]  to do something nobody was asking for. A proprietary DDR5 module, writes Anthony Young.
[4623.42 --> 4625.02]  The module, do you want to bring up a picture, Luke?
[4625.02 --> 4625.66]  Yeah.
[4625.66 --> 4633.02]  Called compression attached memory module, or CAM, is described as a compact way to replace
[4633.02 --> 4639.02]  two separate SODIM modules with a single one, which honestly sounds kind of cool, doesn't it?
[4639.02 --> 4640.62]  Yeah, absolutely.
[4640.62 --> 4646.86]  Each module is split into two separate zones of eight chips each. So it's basically like taking
[4646.86 --> 4652.22]  two SODIMs and gluing them together. And according to Dell's marketing, the machine that they're going
[4652.22 --> 4658.86]  to debut on, the Precision 7670, will be able to support up to 128 gigs of memory as a result.
[4659.50 --> 4666.86]  That's pretty freaking incredible. Dell claims that CAM allows them to provide memory upgrades
[4666.86 --> 4672.78]  and higher capacities without the need to solder the chips to the main board, which would prevent any
[4672.78 --> 4681.02]  upgrades at all. Unfortunately, it is not known at this time, prospective buyers, whether CAM will be
[4681.02 --> 4686.70]  an open standard. Because if it's not, then yes, you could upgrade, but you would be holding to Dell.
[4686.70 --> 4693.58]  Here we go. There's a good look at it. So the idea is to save the profile, right? So you can still make
[4693.58 --> 4697.50]  super thin machines, but not solder the RAM.
[4697.50 --> 4698.14]  Yeah.
[4698.14 --> 4704.78]  So to be fair to Dell, the Precision 7670 is supposed to be an absolute beast with an Alder
[4704.78 --> 4713.26]  Lake HX CPU and either Arc Pro or RTX A5000 GPU. So they're going to cost a small fortune and there
[4713.26 --> 4719.10]  probably isn't a lot of internal space remaining for expansion slots. But there's a twist on this.
[4719.10 --> 4724.62]  Dell's also got a proprietary graphics connector based on MXM called Dell Graphics Form Factor,
[4724.62 --> 4730.22]  which first debuted on the Area 51M. So there's a recent precedent for Dell going down this path.
[4730.22 --> 4737.18]  So Luke, what's your initial sort of reaction? Our discussion question is,
[4737.18 --> 4742.86]  is this like one of those monkey paw situations, right? Where you've been asking for upgradeable
[4742.86 --> 4751.66]  laptops and you end up with like this cursed solution where it's upgradable, but it's proprietary.
[4751.66 --> 4754.30]  I don't think we know that it's a cursed solution yet because there,
[4755.34 --> 4760.30]  where's the notes on this? Is, was this taken out of the notes? This is something that I'm concerned
[4760.30 --> 4764.78]  about. Yeah. Be careful. Just, just try to answer it based on what we only knew from the initial
[4764.78 --> 4768.22]  articles covering it so far. Give you guys more detail in a sec.
[4768.22 --> 4778.86]  Um, okay. So this note is in the bolded Alex note part, but I can say that, right?
[4780.06 --> 4783.02]  Uh, yeah. I can say things that are in the bolded Alex note.
[4783.02 --> 4789.02]  Yeah. I wanted your spicy take right out of the gate on like a proprietary memory module.
[4789.02 --> 4795.98]  But okay. But the problem is, ah, there's important things in the, in the Alex note about that.
[4795.98 --> 4798.94]  Yeah. But you didn't know that yet. Ignore that. Pretend it doesn't exist. Look,
[4798.94 --> 4801.42]  I'm going to make life really easy for you and I'm going to remove it. So if,
[4801.42 --> 4804.22]  wow. So the initial reporting on this was just what's up here.
[4804.22 --> 4809.74]  That's it. If I only read the initial reporting, which I don't, which based on the additional
[4809.74 --> 4814.54]  reporting is not fair or accurate in my opinion. Just, just, just, oh my God, Luke.
[4814.54 --> 4819.26]  Um, but then I would say that it's bad. I don't want, I don't want proprietary components. I don't
[4819.26 --> 4824.54]  want to buy a laptop that has something that I can't replace unless I buy that thing. Like when
[4824.54 --> 4831.50]  it's Ram, right? Because there is stuff that's very true. Like if you look at the, uh, the, uh,
[4831.50 --> 4836.30]  hyper text link for a company that it famously overcharges for parts, there's Ram in there. It's
[4836.30 --> 4843.26]  like 16 gigs. It's like a $500. Um, exactly. It's, it's, it gets really brutal and I'm not a fan of
[4843.26 --> 4848.22]  that, but that's potentially not what we're dealing with. So. Right. But the thing is,
[4848.22 --> 4857.18]  proprietary standards often lead us down these paths. Right. Yeah. And you are literally reinventing,
[4858.14 --> 4864.86]  uh, because you gotta remember too, like, it's not like Dell doesn't participate in JDEC. Right.
[4864.86 --> 4873.50]  Right. So if Dell wanted an open standard for a dual module thing for laptops, it's not like they
[4873.50 --> 4879.34]  don't have the relationships to try to create something like that, the industry body standards
[4879.34 --> 4886.62]  way. Right. So in general, every time we see a proprietary way to attach a thing to a computer,
[4886.62 --> 4894.14]  be it a GPU, uh, a memory module, it's about typically locking the user into an environment,
[4894.62 --> 4899.90]  um, as a primary concern with whatever else they were trying to achieve as maybe a similar
[4899.90 --> 4909.26]  level concern or even a secondary concern. So there was a lot of trepidation around this move.
[4909.26 --> 4916.22]  Yeah. But we know these new things now. Alex got to have a meeting with the guy that designed
[4916.22 --> 4923.42]  cam today. Um, some of the info we have is under embargo until such time as it is not under embargo.
[4923.82 --> 4931.26]  So we can't say too much, but Alex's take so far is that it's in, it is legit. And they are in
[4931.26 --> 4936.30]  discussion with JDEC and with Intel to make it a standard. And what that would mean is that instead
[4936.30 --> 4942.94]  of relying on Dell and there may be handful of authorized partners who can make these things.
[4942.94 --> 4948.38]  And we've seen this, we've seen this many times where the only place that you can get an SSD to
[4948.38 --> 4953.34]  go in your, in your Apple machine is from, you know, OWC and maybe like one other supplier,
[4953.34 --> 4958.30]  which means there's very little competition competition and prices stay high. Uh, if they
[4958.30 --> 4962.78]  are making it an open standard, then what we could expect is that prices might be a little higher than
[4962.78 --> 4969.50]  a regular SODIM because it's just less, it's a lower volume part. Um, so that there's just
[4969.50 --> 4975.66]  lower demand, therefore lower production volumes, therefore higher prices. But I would expect the
[4975.66 --> 4981.74]  pricing to be at least close to, or at least reflective of the cost of building it, which is
[4981.74 --> 4987.18]  just, you know, twice as many, uh, DRAM packages. And like, it's going to cost more because it's like
[4987.18 --> 4992.62]  way more RAM and okay. The PCB design overhead has to be covered and we're not going to sell as many
[4992.62 --> 4999.10]  units, but like, it sounds like it could be pretty reasonable. And one of the reasons that this could
[4999.10 --> 5005.58]  be a great move for the industry is that currently SODIM is one to two generations away from not being
[5005.58 --> 5011.42]  able to support increasing memory speeds and capacity. And the connector itself adds a lot of
[5011.42 --> 5016.94]  signal interference as well as cost and Z height, which is the thickness that it adds to the overall
[5016.94 --> 5023.90]  design. Yeah. Currently, if you have 128 gigs of SODIM memory, four sticks, the speed tops out at
[5023.90 --> 5030.62]  4,000 mega transfers per second. I mean, compare that to the leaked speeds in the article. And Dell's
[5030.62 --> 5039.34]  talking about this thing doing, uh, 128 gigs of DDR5, 4,800 transfer per second using this standard.
[5039.34 --> 5044.06]  Well, that's freaking awesome. All right. I think this is a rumor. Yeah.
[5044.06 --> 5047.58]  Yeah. Yeah.
[5047.58 --> 5048.94]  Yeah.
[5048.94 --> 5054.46]  That was allegedly saying that they can achieve that. So honestly, I started out
[5056.06 --> 5061.98]  kind of angry and ended up kind of jacked actually on it. Yeah. Well, when you hear like
[5061.98 --> 5066.62]  Dell proprietary thing, blah, blah, blah, the knee jerk is definitely going to be like,
[5066.62 --> 5070.62]  well, this sucks a lot. Um, well, yeah, they don't have a good track record for that.
[5070.62 --> 5089.52]  Oh, absolutely not. Right. So it's really nice to hear that. I mean, well, hopefully this actually happens, but it really nice to hear that they are legit in discussion with JDAC and Intel and working on making it a standard and stuff like that. So it doesn't go down that route because it sounds like cool tech that would be nice for like a range of people to have.
[5090.60 --> 5091.00]  Absolutely.
[5091.48 --> 5097.12]  And that's actually really exciting. But yeah, when you read like the first few lines of this, it's terrifying.
[5098.24 --> 5099.28]  Oh, I know, right?
[5099.28 --> 5100.06]  This is horrible.
[5101.40 --> 5107.50]  I know you didn't want to give me a take now that we know more, but I didn't know like a week.
[5107.84 --> 5118.96]  I didn't know what your plan was. I didn't know if we were actually going to read the Alex part or not. And I was just like, I don't want to like condemn them if they're actually doing something that might be cool.
[5119.74 --> 5122.12]  But yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[5124.22 --> 5130.26]  Because they would deserve it if the Alex part wasn't in here. Like if that if that didn't exist at all. And I don't mean just Alex's notes, but I mean,
[5130.26 --> 5136.48]  like that concept in the slightest, if they were just making this proprietary, I would suck and I would want to go after them for it.
[5136.48 --> 5142.94]  But a hundred percent. Yeah. Are we ready to talk about how the GPU apocalypse? Oh, holy crap.
[5143.36 --> 5143.86]  Response response.
[5143.96 --> 5146.64]  I don't know how to access the merch messages dashboard.
[5146.64 --> 5152.84]  Oh, can you send it to me? Sorry. Some of you may not have realized, but.
[5156.26 --> 5157.74]  I am not actually here.
[5157.74 --> 5158.14]  Yeah.
[5159.34 --> 5162.98]  It should be in your email, but I can I can fire it to you right now.
[5163.52 --> 5165.88]  I want to just start the next topic.
[5166.38 --> 5167.64]  Hey, Mr.
[5168.00 --> 5170.56]  Bella Vance has already hit me with it.
[5170.66 --> 5171.02]  Beautiful.
[5171.62 --> 5176.46]  Thank you so much for that. We actually don't have a ton of curated merch messages today.
[5176.52 --> 5180.02]  There's only only a handful. Most of them are just going getting pushed to the stream.
[5180.02 --> 5186.90]  So, yeah, guys, don't forget that if you if you want to chat with us, super chats are really not the way to do it anymore.
[5186.90 --> 5190.26]  Over on YouTube, we don't really look at those anymore.
[5190.26 --> 5195.82]  I mean, I did notice that someone spent one hundred dollars to tell me that they don't like me anymore.
[5196.32 --> 5197.26]  That's a really good way.
[5197.56 --> 5202.60]  If you want to really complain about like if you just hate me, just just go at it.
[5202.76 --> 5206.16]  But like tell me through merch messages, buy stuff on the store.
[5206.16 --> 5210.42]  Let her. Yeah. Merge messages are definitely better because then you like get an order.
[5210.72 --> 5211.82]  Yeah. But anyway, Greg.
[5212.10 --> 5217.24]  So I actually I have one more thing to say to Greg is like I don't think that I was creating division.
[5217.24 --> 5218.50]  I think the division's there.
[5218.66 --> 5224.32]  And I think the fact that there's a perceived division because of the things I was saying means that the division is just already there.
[5224.86 --> 5228.06]  If anything, I was trying to be extremely level this week.
[5230.52 --> 5235.08]  It's OK for me to like it's OK for me to not think someone is a messiah.
[5235.08 --> 5237.30]  And it's OK for you to think someone is.
[5238.14 --> 5240.68]  And like whatever, it's it's all good.
[5240.76 --> 5241.52]  But it is tech.
[5241.88 --> 5253.16]  That's the thing is you got to understand that these figures, whether your name is Tim Cook or, you know, Larry Ellison or Bill Gates or whatever.
[5253.42 --> 5256.98]  Like these are people who who are tech.
[5256.98 --> 5258.46]  Like, you know, you can't.
[5259.60 --> 5261.86]  You can't say that something to do with.
[5263.86 --> 5266.46]  Oh, man, I'm trying to think of, you know, someone who I would.
[5267.06 --> 5268.78]  OK, let's say take was right.
[5269.00 --> 5270.56]  Something to do with Steve Wozniak.
[5270.74 --> 5276.52]  When Steve Wozniak opens his mouth or when Linus Torvalds opens his mouth, it's tech.
[5277.22 --> 5282.32]  Whether you know, no matter what they're talking about, it's kind of there.
[5282.32 --> 5284.38]  There are celebrities, right?
[5284.56 --> 5286.66]  So we do talk about them.
[5287.50 --> 5287.66]  Yeah.
[5291.44 --> 5295.50]  We can have, by the way, even if you're still trying to get into the dashboard, Bell's here.
[5295.74 --> 5296.38]  No, I'm good.
[5296.38 --> 5296.72]  I'm good.
[5297.04 --> 5297.30]  OK.
[5297.84 --> 5298.38]  No, no, I'm good.
[5298.44 --> 5298.74]  I'm good.
[5299.34 --> 5300.14]  Tesla using.
[5300.40 --> 5300.92]  Oh, man.
[5300.94 --> 5302.76]  I don't want to talk about Tesla just yet.
[5303.32 --> 5304.04]  That's the whole.
[5304.22 --> 5304.96]  Man, that's the whole thing.
[5304.96 --> 5309.10]  OK, the GPU scale apocalypse may actually be ending.
[5309.28 --> 5311.08]  Sources PC Gamer and 3D Center.
[5311.22 --> 5312.42]  Oh, we should talk through this one.
[5312.58 --> 5314.42]  We should maybe do sponsors or.
[5316.24 --> 5317.36]  I was going to do them eventually.
[5317.70 --> 5318.92]  OK, we've been live for an hour.
[5319.16 --> 5319.38]  You want.
[5319.94 --> 5321.16]  Yeah, go for it.
[5321.62 --> 5321.92]  OK.
[5322.36 --> 5324.70]  Thanks, MSI for sponsoring this week's WAN show.
[5324.94 --> 5329.10]  The MSI Optics MPG 321 QRF-QD.
[5329.56 --> 5331.28]  Dang, that is quite the name.
[5331.56 --> 5333.88]  It's a great option if you're looking for a new gaming monitor.
[5333.88 --> 5340.36]  It's a 32 inch 1440p monitor with an IPS panel that boasts one millisecond response times.
[5340.46 --> 5347.06]  It does up to 175 hertz for smoother gaming and will hit 600 nits peak brightness for,
[5347.42 --> 5350.04]  I would say, an HDR-ish experience.
[5350.46 --> 5354.30]  The reality of it is, though, it's all about the value with this one.
[5354.44 --> 5356.44]  It's an excellent balance.
[5356.74 --> 5359.84]  OK, so instead of going all the way to 4K, it's 1440p.
[5359.84 --> 5364.70]  But that means you can go all the way to 175 hertz, which is great if you're super competitive.
[5365.32 --> 5370.80]  Like, yeah, it only does 600 nits compared to, you know, 1,000 or higher than that,
[5370.86 --> 5372.28]  like you might have on a creator monitor.
[5372.40 --> 5375.08]  But it doesn't cost $1,200, $1,500.
[5376.06 --> 5377.84]  It does have Quantum Dot technology.
[5377.98 --> 5379.44]  It is NVIDIA G-Sync compatible.
[5379.82 --> 5381.38]  So you're going to get great colors.
[5381.52 --> 5383.58]  And you're going to get nice, smooth frame delivery.
[5383.66 --> 5387.16]  And you can learn more and purchase your own at the link down below.
[5387.16 --> 5389.68]  Good bang for the buck gaming display.
[5390.44 --> 5393.32]  The show is also brought to you by JumpCloud.
[5393.92 --> 5398.92]  If you've been in IT for any length of time, you're probably aware of how important the community is to many of us.
[5399.30 --> 5401.70]  How important community is, not the community.
[5401.88 --> 5402.74]  I mean, yes, both.
[5403.16 --> 5407.10]  It brings us together like our love of bacon, sci-fi, and gaming do.
[5407.18 --> 5407.88]  It's part of our DNA.
[5408.10 --> 5413.80]  And JumpCloud knows this and wants to give back to IT admins by creating a form that welcomes and encourages the sharing of ideas,
[5413.94 --> 5416.12]  the asking of questions, and connecting with others.
[5416.12 --> 5421.38]  In the new JumpCloud IT community, they have spaces to talk about the big IT topics.
[5421.46 --> 5423.80]  Hardware, software, network security, and best practices.
[5424.18 --> 5433.32]  Man, Luke, honestly speaking, how hard is it to find a community that really has knowledgeable people talking about networking and security best practices?
[5435.32 --> 5439.42]  I mean, it's actually not that hard, but because of communities like this.
[5440.46 --> 5442.82]  There are places on the internet that you can go.
[5443.80 --> 5444.78]  I mean, compared to...
[5444.78 --> 5445.84]  Okay, hold on a second.
[5445.84 --> 5450.36]  I mean, compared to finding a community to talk about the latest episode of your favorite anime show.
[5450.80 --> 5451.08]  Oh, yeah.
[5451.40 --> 5451.76]  Yeah, yeah.
[5451.94 --> 5452.88]  It's niche.
[5453.52 --> 5455.18]  And so that was my point.
[5455.50 --> 5460.14]  So it's important that entities are going out of their way to create these spaces.
[5460.40 --> 5460.52]  Yeah.
[5460.52 --> 5465.00]  And as the discussions grow, so will the topic areas, so you can suggest more.
[5465.48 --> 5467.32]  There's a lot to navigate in today's IT.
[5467.76 --> 5471.30]  Come and talk to your peers about navigating changes, keeping up to date, and networking.
[5471.86 --> 5479.10]  You guys can even see their career spotlight and advice columns, which are launching next month at community.jumpcloud.com or at the link down below.
[5479.10 --> 5481.20]  Finally, the show is brought to you by Pulseway.

[5518.72 --> 5524.06]  I would like to talk about Google's ban on third-party recording apps on the Play Store.
[5524.94 --> 5525.38]  Yeah.
[5526.44 --> 5527.10]  Hold on.
[5527.84 --> 5529.68]  I want your knee-jerk reaction.
[5530.34 --> 5531.48]  Knee-jerk reaction.
[5531.66 --> 5531.80]  Bad.
[5531.80 --> 5532.48]  Gut reaction.
[5532.66 --> 5532.98]  Bad.
[5533.16 --> 5533.56]  Bad.
[5534.10 --> 5535.56]  My gut reaction is bad.
[5535.98 --> 5536.20]  Sorry?
[5536.42 --> 5536.70]  Say again?
[5536.72 --> 5536.92]  Why?
[5537.58 --> 5537.90]  Why?
[5538.50 --> 5541.32]  I would throw exactly that right back at you.
[5541.54 --> 5541.82]  Why?
[5543.36 --> 5543.84]  Oh.
[5544.12 --> 5544.88]  Oh, okay.
[5544.96 --> 5546.48]  So now the burden of proof is on me.
[5547.18 --> 5547.52]  No.
[5547.82 --> 5548.20]  I just...
[5548.20 --> 5549.40]  Why would you remove it?
[5549.44 --> 5557.44]  There are a lot of places where it's only one person is required to consent to the recording of a call.
[5557.44 --> 5560.06]  Like, genuinely, extremely large amounts of places.
[5560.58 --> 5563.70]  You only have to have one person required to consent to the recording of a call.
[5564.18 --> 5567.66]  Does the legality of single-party consent make it right?
[5567.66 --> 5571.16]  I don't know.
[5571.16 --> 5572.74]  But, like, why would they remove it?
[5572.82 --> 5573.18]  I don't know.
[5574.38 --> 5575.46]  Well, I mean, okay.
[5575.90 --> 5577.28]  Let's talk about...
[5577.28 --> 5578.50]  Man, I was reading a really interesting article.
[5578.50 --> 5580.18]  Like, what if you want to record a call?
[5580.38 --> 5580.70]  And you're...
[5580.70 --> 5584.96]  So, I think what you were just talking about is, like, does the legality of it make it not morally okay?
[5584.96 --> 5595.04]  Well, I think there's scenarios where you would want to record something and the person that is being recorded would not give you consent, but you are still in the right to get this thing recorded.
[5595.36 --> 5596.12]  But that's...
[5596.12 --> 5600.14]  I mean, there's also situations where it would be very bad to record someone without their consent, etc., etc.
[5600.14 --> 5602.72]  So, that's a crazy rabbit hole that I don't want to go down.
[5602.72 --> 5611.68]  But completely removing the functionality of two people both consenting to being recorded, being able to record their call is just, like, why?
[5611.82 --> 5612.86]  I don't...
[5612.86 --> 5613.54]  Why would you do that?
[5614.38 --> 5615.34]  I don't get it.
[5616.56 --> 5622.08]  And, like, if you're a big company or something like that, you're going to find a way to record your phone calls regardless.
[5622.76 --> 5623.48]  So, like, it...
[5623.48 --> 5631.42]  And if you're super nefarious, if you're, like, really trying to do, like, bad, evil things by recording phone calls, you're going to find a way to record that phone call regardless.
[5631.42 --> 5635.10]  Spoiler alert, it's incredibly easy.
[5635.62 --> 5637.22]  You don't need one of these apps.
[5637.54 --> 5645.78]  So, like, all you're really stopping is extreme layman, which in a lot of those situations, I feel like they would have consent on both sides.
[5645.98 --> 5646.56]  So, I just...
[5646.56 --> 5647.48]  I don't really get the point.
[5648.12 --> 5658.72]  If someone's actually trying to, like, do something planned out that's, like, really not good, they're going to find the extremely obvious ways to do this without one of these apps.
[5659.66 --> 5660.06]  Okay.
[5660.06 --> 5666.00]  I read a really interesting article before the WAN show today that was not about tech at all.
[5666.16 --> 5668.54]  It was about front license plates.
[5669.78 --> 5669.90]  Okay.
[5670.04 --> 5673.02]  The arguments for front license plates...
[5673.02 --> 5676.42]  Well, first, let's start with the arguments against front license plates.
[5676.94 --> 5679.56]  They make your car look subjectively uglier.
[5679.90 --> 5680.06]  Okay?
[5680.14 --> 5680.98]  That's one of the big ones.
[5680.98 --> 5696.72]  And privacy advocates argue that front license plates make it much easier to track the comings and goings of the greater populace and create models that could anticipate their move...
[5696.72 --> 5700.64]  Or that could monitor and then anticipate their movements.
[5700.64 --> 5704.98]  These are the arguments for the removal of front license plates.
[5705.58 --> 5705.82]  All right.
[5705.82 --> 5712.88]  The arguments for maintaining front license plates are taxation revenue.
[5713.26 --> 5717.32]  So, obviously, this is an argument that's made at, like, a government level, not to individual users.
[5717.86 --> 5719.52]  Or not taxation, but ticketing.
[5719.72 --> 5720.70]  Because ticketing revenue.
[5721.10 --> 5721.62]  Right?
[5721.62 --> 5725.02]  As well as law enforcement.
[5725.02 --> 5726.34]  You also have to buy the plate, right?
[5726.78 --> 5728.28]  So, I think it's a little bit of both.
[5728.56 --> 5729.02]  Well, hold on.
[5729.06 --> 5729.52]  We're getting there.
[5729.64 --> 5730.34]  Hold on.
[5730.52 --> 5732.62]  These are the arguments for why we should keep them.
[5732.62 --> 5736.28]  And, basically, it's better law enforcement.
[5736.72 --> 5741.48]  So, easier to track down a vehicle when you can identify it both coming and going.
[5741.66 --> 5742.80]  So, that's the pro and the con.
[5743.40 --> 5749.50]  And then increased government revenue from more accurate law enforcement, essentially, really.
[5750.36 --> 5754.68]  But then, what's great is that this org, Front License Plate...
[5754.68 --> 5755.46]  I forget what it was called.
[5755.58 --> 5757.54]  Like, Front License Plate Orgs of some sort.
[5757.54 --> 5787.52]  Front License Plate Orgs of some sort.
[5787.54 --> 5791.68]  Utility sort of.
[5792.22 --> 5795.18]  You know, whose privacy is more important, okay?
[5795.18 --> 5802.74]  The privacy of someone on the other end of the line who may or may not have given consent.
[5803.10 --> 5809.92]  Where the laws may or may not exist to protect that person, right?
[5810.62 --> 5812.78]  Is that person's privacy a priority?
[5812.78 --> 5817.88]  Why does the law necessarily matter?
[5817.88 --> 5829.88]  And if that person's privacy isn't a priority, well, what about the non-privacy rights of whoever it is who is recording the call that might be violated, right?
[5829.88 --> 5844.34]  Like, maybe the person who wants to record this call shouldn't give, like, two sh** about the privacy of their employer who is breaking the law by coercing them into working unpaid hours or whatever the case may be.
[5844.34 --> 5849.34]  You know, two wrongs don't make a right, I guess.
[5849.34 --> 5849.96]  Or do they?
[5850.34 --> 5852.10]  Or whose right is more important?
[5852.76 --> 5862.82]  And I think that the conclusion, the only conclusion we can really come to here is that legality aside, from an ethical standpoint, this is an extremely gray area.
[5864.90 --> 5866.60]  Recording conversations with people.
[5866.60 --> 5874.84]  Yeah, because there's going to be times where people are doing it to protect themselves, and there's going to be times where people are doing it to attack other people.
[5875.08 --> 5875.18]  Sure.
[5875.48 --> 5875.96]  Okay, great.
[5876.12 --> 5876.34]  Yeah.
[5876.94 --> 5882.46]  So then, knowing how gray it is, here's what I'll say.
[5883.40 --> 5886.46]  If I'm Google, here's why I made this move.
[5886.64 --> 5888.60]  And I don't know why Google actually did this.
[5888.90 --> 5889.08]  Okay?
[5889.08 --> 5895.12]  They state this update is specifically targeted apps that allow audio recordings but that don't notify the person on the other end.
[5895.12 --> 5898.84]  So if I'm Google, this is a cover my ass move.
[5899.98 --> 5910.64]  I don't want to suddenly be held liable when someone does use a non-notifying call recording app to do something nefarious.
[5911.26 --> 5913.20]  And so your question was why?
[5913.32 --> 5914.18]  Why did they do this?
[5914.60 --> 5916.12]  And I think they're just covering their butts.
[5916.44 --> 5917.76]  I don't think it's about legality.
[5917.96 --> 5919.10]  I don't think it's about ethics.
[5919.10 --> 5923.58]  I think it's about the lawyers being like, hey, this could be a problem at some point.
[5923.68 --> 5924.48]  And I think it's that simple.
[5925.12 --> 5925.90]  That's my take.
[5926.52 --> 5928.70]  And I know it took me a really long time to get there.
[5929.96 --> 5931.32]  I'm not running on much sleep.
[5932.30 --> 5932.66]  Yeah.
[5934.16 --> 5936.42]  Google, I'm looking into it right now.
[5936.56 --> 5938.88]  Someone, M. Kirsch.
[5939.26 --> 5940.92]  Sorry, I probably just butchered that name.
[5940.92 --> 5946.34]  But they let me know that Google apparently has call recording built in.
[5951.26 --> 5955.76]  And it looks, yeah, it looks like you can.
[5956.58 --> 5958.82]  On an Android device, open the voice app.
[5959.16 --> 5962.90]  At the top left, tap the hamburger button and click on settings.
[5962.90 --> 5967.38]  And then under calls, turn on incoming call options.
[5967.38 --> 5970.58]  And then you have the option to record a call.
[5971.00 --> 5972.60]  To start recording, tap four.
[5973.34 --> 5973.46]  Okay.
[5973.52 --> 5978.06]  So with their recording thing, all participants will hear an announcement that the recording has begun.
[5978.06 --> 5981.52]  I wonder if you can start the recording before the person has picked up.
[5984.78 --> 5985.44]  I don't know.
[5985.64 --> 5985.86]  Interesting.
[5986.12 --> 5986.96]  I doubt it.
[5987.50 --> 5989.38]  I would think it would be a little smarter than that.
[5989.46 --> 5996.64]  And honestly, like, in some cases, there are situations where I wouldn't want the other party to know that I'm recording the call.
[5996.64 --> 6001.20]  Because as soon as they know that I'm recording the call, they're not going to engage in whatever unethical or illegal behavior.
[6001.20 --> 6003.82]  You can extremely easily do that, like I already brought up.
[6004.02 --> 6007.40]  Like, banning these apps doesn't stop people from recording calls.
[6008.26 --> 6008.34]  Yeah.
[6008.70 --> 6009.30]  It does.
[6009.44 --> 6010.66]  Well, here's what it does do.
[6010.74 --> 6012.50]  It does lower the barrier to entry.
[6012.92 --> 6018.84]  It's kind of like apps that have permissions that don't allow you to screen capture them.
[6019.00 --> 6021.58]  You know, like a password app that doesn't allow.
[6021.66 --> 6025.78]  Like, obviously, you can get around it by just taking a picture of the screen of the phone with another device.
[6025.78 --> 6033.10]  But what it does is it increases the barrier to entry for, you know, casual miscreants, I guess, is what I would say.
[6033.38 --> 6033.48]  Right.
[6033.80 --> 6034.18]  Yeah, yeah.
[6036.40 --> 6040.04]  The topmost dog in Twitch says call recording should be an accessibility feature.
[6040.20 --> 6044.02]  I use it because I have memory consolidation issues and often need to refer back to a call recording.
[6044.14 --> 6044.46]  Take notes.
[6044.80 --> 6045.44]  100%.
[6045.44 --> 6049.06]  I'm, man, I'm on the same page.
[6049.06 --> 6056.74]  Like, if I just could have a setting on my phone that's just like, yeah, just record every conversation that I have, I would just use that.
[6056.74 --> 6061.52]  Whenever I have calls with people at work, if they're like, hey, can like, can like Flowplane make this new thing?
[6061.90 --> 6063.10]  I'll have a call with them.
[6063.16 --> 6065.80]  I'll ask them right away if I can record it and just record the entire thing.
[6065.80 --> 6069.62]  Because like, they'll mention like some random feature that they want.
[6069.64 --> 6071.30]  And like, if I don't document it, perfect.
[6071.38 --> 6077.62]  And then you have to understand that you're like, you're doing that phone call game to yourself when you're trying to document that stuff.
[6077.62 --> 6085.38]  Because unless you type it exactly the way that they worded it, you might write it down in a slightly different way than they intended.
[6085.64 --> 6088.14]  And then you hand that to a developer or whoever else.
[6088.26 --> 6090.98]  And they interpret it in a slightly different way again.
[6091.14 --> 6094.20]  And then you're so many layers of extraction from the original ask.
[6094.34 --> 6095.72]  And it makes it complicated.
[6095.86 --> 6098.46]  So I just, yeah, I like recording calls as well.
[6098.68 --> 6101.06]  But again, I ask people.
[6101.06 --> 6107.92]  But I mean, we're in, I'm pretty sure we're in single party consent here in BC.
[6109.00 --> 6111.34]  But I still ask people because it just makes sense.
[6112.24 --> 6113.10]  Yeah, it's just polite.
[6113.38 --> 6115.74]  Except for situations where it's not about politeness.
[6115.74 --> 6126.00]  It's about, you know, your landlord admitting that they're renovicting you or that they're evicting you because of the color of your skin or something.
[6126.90 --> 6128.90]  Yeah, then you want to, you want to record that evidence.
[6129.38 --> 6129.46]  Yeah.
[6129.46 --> 6132.80]  Yeah, which obviously they're not going to say if they know you're recording it.
[6133.04 --> 6145.40]  I mean, with that said, it's amazing how much, how many, like, obviously recorded, like, where the phone is just clearly in plain view recordings there are on the internet of people acting like absolute pieces of human garbage.
[6146.86 --> 6147.26]  Yeah.
[6147.80 --> 6151.20]  I mean, there's a court case of one of those going on right now.
[6151.32 --> 6153.58]  But that's a whole, that's a totally different can of worms.
[6154.12 --> 6155.76]  The, oh, man.
[6157.12 --> 6157.94]  What's his name?
[6157.94 --> 6159.86]  Johnny Depp and Amber Heard?
[6161.10 --> 6162.56]  Oh, that whole thing.
[6162.66 --> 6163.10]  That's crazy.
[6163.32 --> 6163.52]  Oh, good lord.
[6163.52 --> 6164.44]  I don't want to get into that.
[6164.52 --> 6166.28]  I don't know anywhere near enough.
[6166.44 --> 6167.76]  It took me a while to remember their names.
[6167.98 --> 6169.06]  I don't want to get into this.
[6169.96 --> 6174.14]  It's just, I know there's a bunch of, like, recordings of conversations in that.
[6174.14 --> 6175.26]  Oh, yeah.
[6175.72 --> 6179.30]  As far as I can tell, they're both going nuclear option.
[6179.52 --> 6183.66]  And just like, well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me.
[6184.28 --> 6187.86]  Apparently, just neither of them are going to emerge from this looking good.
[6188.02 --> 6188.80]  I have no idea.
[6188.84 --> 6190.06]  I've not been following it.
[6190.36 --> 6191.02]  I don't know.
[6191.02 --> 6192.34]  I just, yeah.
[6194.04 --> 6195.32]  Sorry, MTG Court?
[6195.42 --> 6196.40]  What is MTG Court?
[6196.48 --> 6198.14]  Apparently, there's another high profile.
[6198.26 --> 6199.10]  Magic the Gathering?
[6201.02 --> 6205.02]  MTG is, anytime anyone says MTG to me, I just think Magic the Gathering.
[6205.24 --> 6205.76]  I don't know.
[6206.60 --> 6207.74]  What are you even talking about?
[6207.74 --> 6213.72]  I know what we should talk about, which is the next topic.
[6213.80 --> 6215.36]  No, I know who MTG is.
[6215.42 --> 6216.46]  We're not talking about that.
[6218.36 --> 6219.76]  Sorry, what are we talking about now?
[6220.32 --> 6222.36]  I think we should dive into the next topic.
[6222.80 --> 6223.72]  Netflix shares?
[6224.78 --> 6225.68]  Or USB-C?
[6227.02 --> 6229.24]  Okay, let's just start with this.
[6229.38 --> 6230.88]  Is Netflix completely f***ed?
[6232.60 --> 6233.54]  Are they done?
[6234.18 --> 6235.52]  I don't think they're done.
[6235.52 --> 6239.28]  I think, I think...
[6239.28 --> 6243.74]  200,000 subscribers lost in a single quarter?
[6243.88 --> 6245.38]  They had 220 million.
[6245.50 --> 6251.20]  It's going to take a while for that to, you know, completely get rid of all their subscribers.
[6251.88 --> 6255.82]  They did expect to apparently gain 2.5 million subscribers.
[6256.42 --> 6258.24]  And I think they're going to have to can that.
[6258.54 --> 6260.92]  I didn't know all of this was going on.
[6260.92 --> 6270.44]  But like a week or two ago, I cancelled a Netflix subscription that I had like effectively gifted to my girlfriend because I don't really watch TV.
[6271.22 --> 6278.22]  Because I was going through like credit card statements and I was like, whoa, this is a lot more expensive than when I originally signed up for you.
[6278.90 --> 6280.14]  Can we cancel this?
[6280.32 --> 6282.52]  Because I didn't even know that they upped their rates.
[6282.52 --> 6286.78]  Because I guess their email for that went into my like advertising junk.
[6287.76 --> 6288.00]  Right.
[6288.30 --> 6289.56]  So I had no idea.
[6289.64 --> 6291.20]  And they upped it by like quite a bit.
[6291.34 --> 6294.08]  Like I feel like I'm paying significantly more than I used to.
[6294.82 --> 6295.92]  It's very substantial.
[6296.24 --> 6297.04]  Yeah, it's a lot.
[6297.14 --> 6298.60]  Like it's a lot of money.
[6299.36 --> 6306.30]  I think one of the problems that they have is that their shows, I think pretty much all shows these days, are extremely expensive to produce.
[6307.14 --> 6307.58]  Yeah.
[6308.38 --> 6310.38]  And it's difficult to sustain.
[6310.38 --> 6314.54]  And also like sending that much data out, it's really expensive.
[6315.04 --> 6316.02]  It just is.
[6316.28 --> 6319.62]  We legitimately actually know that what they do is really hard.
[6319.84 --> 6320.24]  Yeah.
[6320.30 --> 6321.98]  And they are very, very good at it.
[6322.24 --> 6323.46]  They are extremely good at it.
[6323.48 --> 6327.38]  Like they actually have people that work there that are masters at that type of stuff.
[6327.38 --> 6333.34]  So like I'm sure they do a very good job of making it efficient, but it's still really expensive.
[6333.34 --> 6338.88]  And it's this case of I saw people talking about it on the tweeters.
[6339.40 --> 6348.34]  But it's one of those cases of where a lot of the share price or share value of Netflix was based around this infinite growth idea.
[6349.38 --> 6352.80]  They stopped the infinite growth and the share price tanked.
[6352.80 --> 6359.20]  There's speculation that their company is going to see a significant further dive.
[6359.38 --> 6363.18]  Like there's a highlight here saying they're projected to lose another 2 million by June.
[6364.04 --> 6369.28]  And I think that could be a lot of people are complaining about the shows and the types of shows that are on Netflix these days.
[6369.38 --> 6370.06]  A lot of people are complaining.
[6370.24 --> 6370.66]  Like me.
[6370.66 --> 6374.08]  Like I had no idea there was any actual things going on.
[6374.16 --> 6377.10]  I canceled it because I didn't realize how crazy expensive it was.
[6378.30 --> 6379.26]  But yeah, I think.
[6381.06 --> 6388.10]  One of Netflix's biggest problems is when you have a subscription model, you have to hook people on something and then you have to keep them wanting it.
[6388.16 --> 6388.26]  Right.
[6388.70 --> 6388.88]  Yeah.
[6389.00 --> 6390.04]  You have to keep them wanting it.
[6390.04 --> 6402.48]  And Netflix has developed this really bad habit of running a season or two seasons of a show and then just rug pulling people over and over and over again.
[6402.50 --> 6403.34]  And you get jaded.
[6404.08 --> 6409.94]  You don't want to get you don't want to get hooked anymore because you're just like imagine if your dealer.
[6410.14 --> 6413.24]  OK, stopped being able to give you the drug you like.
[6413.24 --> 6420.82]  Like if every time they got you, they gave you something new and they gave it to you for a bit and they were like, sorry, I can't get that anymore.
[6420.98 --> 6425.24]  And you go through this awful withdrawal and they're like, OK, but here's something different.
[6425.44 --> 6426.44]  Why don't you try this one?
[6426.54 --> 6428.22]  And you're like, OK, all right.
[6428.24 --> 6429.48]  Yeah, I could I could get into this.
[6429.52 --> 6429.84]  I like that.
[6429.90 --> 6432.00]  But boom, cold turkey withdrawal.
[6432.20 --> 6434.10]  Like it's not a good cycle.
[6434.10 --> 6435.30]  People don't want that.
[6437.80 --> 6441.80]  And it's been such a pattern for them.
[6441.80 --> 6444.22]  And a big part of it is, like you said, the shows are so expensive.
[6446.04 --> 6454.56]  I feel like I've always been a little jaded with TV shows since I was a I was a Firefly fan.
[6454.64 --> 6454.80]  Right.
[6455.86 --> 6458.40]  And that that got canceled when it really shouldn't have been.
[6458.62 --> 6461.62]  And ever since then, I'm just like, I don't really want to get attached to a show.
[6462.84 --> 6463.56]  I don't know.
[6464.90 --> 6468.14]  There's some shows every once in a blue moon like Kim's Convenience.
[6468.14 --> 6469.78]  I actually really liked Kim's Convenience.
[6469.78 --> 6481.08]  It wasn't like it didn't blow my hair back, but it was it was a nice, happy, positive, have in the background while you do other things type of kind of show.
[6482.46 --> 6483.58]  But like, I don't know.
[6483.62 --> 6486.40]  It's just it's it's very expensive these days.
[6486.40 --> 6498.18]  And we're running into I mean, not to get into this type of stuff, but like inflation is kind of popping off right now.
[6499.30 --> 6502.62]  There's that whole like the world runs on a 90 day food cycle thing.
[6502.78 --> 6506.60]  The war in Ukraine has been going on for X amount of days.
[6507.52 --> 6511.04]  Ukraine and Russia produce such a massive percentage of the world's grain.
[6511.04 --> 6515.20]  And overall calories available to the world is going to down go down by quite a bit.
[6515.84 --> 6519.60]  Inflation is already cranked up when food prices almost inevitably go up.
[6519.62 --> 6520.46]  It's going to be even worse.
[6520.52 --> 6521.02]  All this kind of stuff.
[6521.10 --> 6525.12]  So like the crunch on people is very, very intense right now.
[6525.12 --> 6533.96]  And you have Netflix, which like we can all live without jumping their costs up very significantly.
[6534.48 --> 6538.88]  While I don't know this because I don't watch, but I've seen a lot of people argue.
[6539.04 --> 6548.60]  I have no idea what the substance behind this is, but I've seen a lot of people argue that the quality of the shows is maybe going down or maybe the shows that they liked are getting canceled or whatever else.
[6548.60 --> 6551.28]  And it's just, it's not a, it's not a feel good time.
[6551.40 --> 6553.32]  It's, it's no longer honeymoon period for Netflix.
[6553.54 --> 6555.22]  They have a huge amount of other competition.
[6555.92 --> 6560.62]  The shows are tenuous and the costing is going way, way, way up.
[6560.74 --> 6562.54]  So it's yeah.
[6562.54 --> 6565.98]  And, and you know what?
[6566.12 --> 6567.20]  Here's another problem.
[6567.74 --> 6569.74]  All I'm doing is pointing out problems.
[6570.44 --> 6575.70]  I'm not actually coming up with any solutions because if they did the opposite of what they're doing now,
[6575.70 --> 6582.48]  I described starting shows and ending them prematurely as rug pulling, but you know what the opposite of that is?
[6583.02 --> 6583.90]  Beating dead horses.
[6584.34 --> 6585.22]  It's the Simpsons.
[6585.34 --> 6585.48]  Yeah.
[6585.48 --> 6587.38]  I mean, Simpsons is like good this season or something.
[6587.48 --> 6588.74]  I haven't, I haven't watched it yet.
[6588.86 --> 6589.22]  I will.
[6589.44 --> 6590.16]  Too many seasons.
[6590.26 --> 6591.62]  You should end it when it's still good.
[6591.62 --> 6591.88]  Right?
[6592.10 --> 6592.34]  Yeah.
[6592.86 --> 6593.20]  Right.
[6593.40 --> 6593.80]  Exactly.
[6594.18 --> 6596.30]  So how do, how is there any way to win?
[6596.30 --> 6600.60]  And you know, this is how we end up with how many Marvel movies are we up to?
[6600.70 --> 6603.94]  30, 30 movies in a cinematic universe.
[6603.94 --> 6610.48]  This is how we end up with this, the stupid Boba Fett series, which is like, well, people like Mandalorian.
[6610.64 --> 6612.86]  I guess we'll just make more of that.
[6613.88 --> 6614.36]  Yeah.
[6614.46 --> 6623.88]  And so, you know, I'm sitting here going, Hey, Netflix, your mistake was to try things and be creative and realize that not everything was going to work.
[6623.96 --> 6626.24]  Like, no, no, actually, that's good.
[6626.36 --> 6627.34]  That's a force for good.
[6627.88 --> 6628.40]  Crap.
[6628.70 --> 6629.02]  Right?
[6629.08 --> 6631.54]  Like, I don't, I don't have a solution for them.
[6631.54 --> 6643.28]  I think, and I mean, like, as if, as if I can say anything that's going to be meaningful or impactful to someone who's like currently in crisis mode, trying to run Netflix.
[6643.28 --> 6653.44]  So my, my opinion here is probably valueless, but I would argue that I think the costing of a lot of their shows needs to go down so that they become more viable.
[6653.44 --> 6654.52]  If that makes sense.
[6654.52 --> 6664.84]  If, if you can produce these shows, because I've heard some of the numbers, I don't remember off the top of my head right now, but I've heard some of the per episode numbers for how much it costs to make one of these shows.
[6664.96 --> 6668.46]  And it's huge, like terrifyingly huge.
[6668.46 --> 6683.68]  Um, and if you, if they, if they, if they could significantly drop that, like very significantly drop that, which I think they could for a lot of different shows, um, because you don't need cinematic marvels for every single show that's on Netflix.
[6683.68 --> 6685.56]  There could be some more basic stuff, right?
[6685.56 --> 6692.94]  Like some of my favorite movies, um, it's basically like apartment rooms and like convenience stores.
[6692.94 --> 6697.74]  Like these are not expensive places to, to film in.
[6698.08 --> 6705.40]  Um, and if you try to make more stuff like that, which is cheaper to produce, it's not as much of a burden to keep it going for the fans that do like it.
[6705.86 --> 6712.48]  Um, so I, I feel like they've, they've gotten caught in this trap of like, well, we're always growing.
[6712.62 --> 6714.30]  The stock is really strong.
[6714.30 --> 6721.78]  Let's just keep pumping these like basically huge lattice of halo product type shows.
[6721.78 --> 6723.94]  And then when they don't work, just can them.
[6724.08 --> 6726.12]  And I think people are just a little jaded about that.
[6726.30 --> 6726.42]  Yeah.
[6726.42 --> 6727.62]  Someone mentioned the office.
[6727.74 --> 6727.98]  Yeah.
[6727.98 --> 6738.58]  One of the most successful, um, still watched incredibly intensely popular shows of all time is filmed in like an office building.
[6739.44 --> 6739.88]  Yep.
[6740.02 --> 6740.36]  Sure.
[6740.36 --> 6746.52]  They have a few episodes here or there where, which are quite extravagant, but a lot of it is just people sitting around in an office building.
[6746.52 --> 6751.30]  Like you can create fantastic stuff with not the insane budget that they have now.
[6751.30 --> 6759.20]  Um, and I, I think that should have been more of a focus significantly more in the past.
[6759.50 --> 6761.26]  I don't know what can necessarily save them now.
[6762.26 --> 6768.48]  Um, a lot of people are pointing out, Hey Linus, like there's a, there's a middle ground here and you're right.
[6768.48 --> 6776.24]  You should end the show while it's still good rather than canceling it when you couldn't make it work.
[6776.24 --> 6782.14]  Like giving people, wrapping things up, giving people closure is something we don't get nearly enough of in TV series these days.
[6782.14 --> 6783.14]  That's totally true.
[6783.14 --> 6784.14]  That's totally fair.
[6784.14 --> 6785.14]  And that's totally fair.
[6785.14 --> 6790.04]  But it is one of those things that's really hard to get right when you have all these conflicting voices in your ear.
[6790.04 --> 6791.04]  Right?
[6791.04 --> 6792.04]  Oh yeah.
[6792.04 --> 6794.04]  You've got your shareholders going like this.
[6794.04 --> 6795.04]  I'm sorry.
[6795.04 --> 6800.04]  Did you just stop making something that is like making tons of money and driving the stock up?
[6800.04 --> 6802.94]  And then you've got viewers going, Hey, did you just cancel something?
[6802.94 --> 6803.94]  I still enjoyed watching.
[6803.94 --> 6806.94]  And you're sitting here going, yeah, but from an artistic standpoint, this was the best thing to do.
[6806.94 --> 6809.64]  Trust me, trust me in the longterm, this will be better for you.
[6809.64 --> 6812.24]  And people don't necessarily want what's good for them.
[6812.24 --> 6815.14]  And it's really tough, right?
[6815.14 --> 6816.94]  It's tough.
[6816.94 --> 6821.54]  It's hard to get right is what I'm, is all I have to say about that.
[6821.54 --> 6821.84]  Yeah.
[6821.84 --> 6825.14]  Chaos 5 mentioned the other issue is other streaming companies are putting on stuff too.
[6825.14 --> 6825.24]  Yeah.
[6825.24 --> 6831.64]  I mentioned that there's, there's lots of competition for Netflix now and, and for almost Netflix's entire life, there was none.
[6831.64 --> 6841.64]  Like it was, it was Netflix had this extremely long run of practically no competition, which was, which was stunning to me for years.
[6841.64 --> 6845.24]  Um, because it just made no sense to me.
[6845.24 --> 6848.84]  Like when Disney started putting shows on Netflix, I was just straight up stunned.
[6849.94 --> 6852.94]  Like the fact that they didn't just make their own, it was astonishing.
[6852.94 --> 6854.44]  I mean, hold on a second, Luke.
[6854.44 --> 6858.24]  It costs $250 million to make a video streaming platform.
[6858.24 --> 6861.44]  So I can see why they, Hey, no, it does.
[6861.44 --> 6861.94]  It does.
[6862.08 --> 6862.34]  Yes.
[6862.50 --> 6863.06]  No, it does.
[6863.32 --> 6864.34]  Pay us, pay us that.
[6864.48 --> 6865.52]  I don't think it's in the doc.
[6865.58 --> 6866.44]  I don't think it's in the doc.
[6866.52 --> 6870.18]  Do you want to just grab an article and put up so people can tell what the heck we're talking about?
[6870.40 --> 6870.74]  Yeah.
[6870.74 --> 6875.08]  Uh, I mean, I can talk about it without throwing that up, but I can try to find one at the same
[6875.08 --> 6875.38]  time.
[6875.38 --> 6883.94]  Uh, CNN plus, uh, the most amazing streaming service ever made lasted for three months.
[6884.14 --> 6885.46]  Apparently it costs them.
[6885.46 --> 6887.84]  I, I, I'm trying to find a document right now.
[6888.10 --> 6891.94]  Um, yeah, the Washington post says it was a hundred million dollars.
[6891.94 --> 6894.66]  I read somewhere else that it was $250 million.
[6895.16 --> 6895.82]  Who knows?
[6895.82 --> 6902.50]  But it was in the three, three digit millions of dollars to produce this streaming service
[6902.50 --> 6904.02]  that lasted for three weeks.
[6904.10 --> 6906.90]  I, I read a lot of this is just stuff that I read.
[6906.90 --> 6911.36]  I didn't witness it perfectly or personally, because I mean, if I'm canceling Netflix, there's
[6911.36 --> 6912.56]  no way I'm subscribing to CNN.
[6912.56 --> 6913.44]  Three weeks, Luke.
[6913.52 --> 6914.84]  Apparently it lasted three weeks.
[6915.04 --> 6916.06]  Did I say three months?
[6916.06 --> 6916.94]  I meant three weeks.
[6917.02 --> 6917.20]  Yeah.
[6917.56 --> 6917.74]  Yeah.
[6917.74 --> 6918.68]  So it lasted three weeks.
[6918.68 --> 6921.42]  It apparently cost $250 million to make.
[6921.70 --> 6924.02]  There was a bunch of very grandiose statements.
[6924.02 --> 6929.28]  Like apparently they were selling NFTs of like the first minute of CNN plus.
[6929.28 --> 6931.52]  Cause they were like, this is the most monumental thing.
[6931.70 --> 6933.00]  This, I don't have a perfect quote.
[6933.02 --> 6936.38]  I don't have it in front of me, but something along the lines of this is the most monumental
[6936.38 --> 6940.98]  thing that we've ever launched since the beginning of like CNN way, way back in the
[6940.98 --> 6941.20]  day.
[6941.58 --> 6945.80]  Um, clearly it wasn't, there was fewer than 10,000 subscribers.
[6945.80 --> 6951.50]  So, I mean, if you look at how much it's cost to get flow playing going, you look at the
[6951.50 --> 6953.82]  amount of subscribers we got, dude, we're amazing.
[6954.26 --> 6955.60]  I, yeah, I know you.
[6955.72 --> 6961.18]  Can I just say you guys are superstars right now because guys, you know, I had someone mad
[6961.18 --> 6963.40]  at me for bringing up that I employ 65 people.
[6963.50 --> 6964.68]  The purpose of it wasn't to brag.
[6964.76 --> 6970.46]  The purpose of it was to point out that, you know, obviously there's a million dollars
[6970.46 --> 6973.52]  flowing through here on a pretty regular basis.
[6973.52 --> 6978.58]  Even just the salaries per month of, of everyone or not just salaries, I guess, but the, the,
[6978.62 --> 6981.84]  the payroll for everyone per month is like very substantial.
[6981.96 --> 6984.06]  There's going to have to be that much money to the company.
[6984.52 --> 6985.84]  I'll tell you this much.
[6986.42 --> 6993.04]  My, my, my means are somewhere between what, uh, what it takes to run a 65 person company
[6993.04 --> 6995.14]  and $250 million.
[6995.56 --> 6996.62]  And it's a lot closer.
[6996.80 --> 6998.26]  It's a lot closer to this one.
[6998.26 --> 7001.00]  Oh man.
[7001.14 --> 7005.36]  I, I, I can't believe someone should just make us an offer.
[7005.58 --> 7012.22]  Like, just be like, Hey, can we just, instead of spending however many millions upon millions
[7012.22 --> 7016.28]  and millions of dollars to develop our own stupid thing?
[7016.28 --> 7022.06]  Like, why don't we just license float plane or why don't we just buy float plane from you
[7022.06 --> 7022.38]  guys?
[7022.38 --> 7026.68]  And Luke can just do nothing but like make the when show and hang out next to his pool
[7026.68 --> 7027.32]  all the time.
[7027.46 --> 7030.50]  Like, honestly though, I could make such a sweet man show.
[7030.62 --> 7033.34]  If that was like all I did the entire week, the topics would be flawless.
[7034.12 --> 7036.72]  Um, I met that'd be such a boring job.
[7037.36 --> 7039.10]  Um, yeah, I don't know.
[7039.14 --> 7040.68]  It's just, it's, it's stunning to me.
[7040.68 --> 7045.26]  I, the less than 10,000 subscriber number is the craziest part.
[7045.38 --> 7049.80]  In my opinion, the 250 million to make it the three weeks that it was alive.
[7049.80 --> 7055.78]  Like both of those numbers are just individually brain exploding because like, how did they
[7055.78 --> 7056.90]  only give it three weeks?
[7057.36 --> 7060.08]  How did it cost $250 million to, to create?
[7060.26 --> 7064.58]  I heard a lot of this again, this is just me reading things variously around the internet.
[7064.58 --> 7065.60]  I don't have sources right now.
[7065.64 --> 7069.18]  I heard that the CFO quit over this or, or, or resigned.
[7069.18 --> 7074.74]  I don't know if that's like the CFO of CNN plus, or if that's the CFO of CNN or what,
[7074.92 --> 7076.42]  but I heard that was a thing.
[7076.78 --> 7081.82]  The most astonishing thing to me individually is the less than 10,000 subscribers.
[7082.06 --> 7087.00]  That is an extremely interesting number because there's, there's ESPN plus, right?
[7087.22 --> 7089.54]  And I looked this up and let me look this up again right now.
[7089.90 --> 7091.16]  Um, ESPN.
[7091.20 --> 7093.14]  Like 22 million or something like that.
[7093.48 --> 7094.36]  17 million.
[7094.48 --> 7095.90]  I've read multiple numbers.
[7095.90 --> 7103.02]  The, the one that looks the most legit to me was that in Q4 of 2021, I believe it was
[7103.02 --> 7104.40]  17.1 million.
[7104.52 --> 7109.60]  I've heard that that number is over 20 million now, but the most legit one that I've seen
[7109.60 --> 7112.92]  is the Q4 2021, where it was 17.1 million.
[7113.28 --> 7116.32]  Um, that's a lot of subscribers, right?
[7116.32 --> 7120.08]  You think about the scale, like CNN is huge.
[7121.02 --> 7121.42]  Yeah.
[7121.68 --> 7123.74]  They pull in less than 10,000 subs.
[7123.82 --> 7124.74]  Like, what were you doing?
[7124.94 --> 7127.88]  How did you actually manage to screw up that bad?
[7127.96 --> 7130.98]  Like, it's like actually amazing.
[7131.80 --> 7134.20]  People are like 10,000 subs still a lot, but okay.
[7134.46 --> 7134.94]  No, it's not.
[7134.94 --> 7135.12]  Yeah.
[7135.12 --> 7137.08]  But like, it's not though.
[7137.14 --> 7138.02]  Not on this scale.
[7138.16 --> 7139.66]  That's, that's the crazy part.
[7139.66 --> 7143.82]  It's like, like if you imagine, if you imagine that, that's what I'm saying, right?
[7143.88 --> 7147.28]  ESPN plus 17.1 million subscribers.
[7147.28 --> 7150.20]  You have to think about the scale that these groups are on.
[7150.42 --> 7150.70]  Like Flowplane.
[7150.94 --> 7156.30]  Look guys, LTT on Flowplane has around 20,000 subscribers.
[7156.82 --> 7158.52]  And we're not like hating on that.
[7158.60 --> 7162.16]  We're not being like, that's, that's, that's pretty, you know?
[7162.22 --> 7162.82]  No, that's a lot.
[7162.82 --> 7163.70]  It's not like that.
[7163.76 --> 7163.96]  Yeah.
[7164.12 --> 7171.12]  But it's, it's a lot, but it's a lot in the context of it only costs a few million to build it.
[7172.30 --> 7172.70]  Yeah.
[7172.92 --> 7173.98]  Like if, if.
[7174.08 --> 7175.20]  That's the difference.
[7175.72 --> 7176.00]  Yeah.
[7176.08 --> 7182.94]  Like it's, it's, if, even if Landis Tech Tips had 10,000 subs on Flowplane right now, I'd be like, oh, it's pretty good.
[7183.12 --> 7183.44]  You know?
[7183.44 --> 7184.16]  Like it's.
[7184.16 --> 7185.04]  It would be sustainable.
[7185.46 --> 7185.78]  Yeah.
[7185.88 --> 7189.46]  It didn't, it didn't cost us $250 million to make the platform.
[7190.04 --> 7192.00]  And we're not seeing it.
[7192.82 --> 7195.22]  Like the scale here is just insane.
[7195.50 --> 7197.74]  I wonder what CNN's like revenue per year is.
[7197.80 --> 7198.72]  Is that a public thing?
[7199.56 --> 7202.14]  I have no idea.
[7203.14 --> 7205.86]  Man, news is just dying.
[7206.34 --> 7208.20]  That's a whole separate conversation.
[7208.36 --> 7209.46]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[7209.54 --> 7210.98]  Whole separate conversation.
[7211.72 --> 7213.62]  We're going to, we're going to bring it back.
[7213.70 --> 7215.20]  We're going to bring it back for tech.
[7215.70 --> 7220.88]  We're going to be finally introducing the labs lead next week.
[7220.88 --> 7222.78]  I promise this time.
[7222.82 --> 7224.50]  I promise next week.
[7225.00 --> 7228.48]  I don't think there's any way we can actually not do it next week.
[7228.60 --> 7231.10]  Like, I think it's, I think it's going to happen.
[7233.52 --> 7236.98]  People on Flowplane are trying to calculate how much we make from Flowplane.
[7236.98 --> 7246.10]  It's going to be real difficult because some people pay for higher tiers and some people have tiers that are still grandfathered.
[7246.18 --> 7248.92]  I don't want to brag, but I think we're pretty consumer first.
[7248.92 --> 7256.08]  We could have increased rates when we moved to, when we moved off hosting it on the forum and we moved to the dedicated site.
[7256.08 --> 7260.18]  But we actually put the dev resources into making less money.
[7260.18 --> 7267.76]  So there's actually a $3 a month tier that does still exist for, what do we, what do we call them?
[7268.88 --> 7269.96]  The grandfather tier?
[7270.18 --> 7270.64]  Grandfather tier.
[7270.72 --> 7275.10]  I don't know what it's actually called externally, but internally we call it grandfather tier.
[7275.36 --> 7275.48]  Yeah.
[7275.48 --> 7282.16]  I can tell you guys, I can tell you guys, grandfather tier, we do not make money on you.
[7283.06 --> 7284.84]  There's so much overhead.
[7284.86 --> 7285.44]  Not great.
[7286.36 --> 7289.64]  Just like in payment processing fees alone.
[7289.80 --> 7290.00]  Okay.
[7290.04 --> 7292.60]  Apparently externally we call it, we call it OG tier.
[7293.42 --> 7294.30]  OG tier.
[7294.44 --> 7294.86]  All right.
[7297.02 --> 7297.84]  That's okay.
[7298.18 --> 7299.48]  It's because we love you guys.
[7299.48 --> 7299.90]  All right.
[7300.50 --> 7301.42]  Well, no, it's not.
[7301.52 --> 7303.34]  It's because we told you it would be $3.
[7303.34 --> 7304.24]  That's why.
[7305.12 --> 7311.40]  And once you say something, you're just kind of stuck with it unless you, unless you can make a solid argument for why not.
[7311.52 --> 7316.16]  And if the solid argument is just money, then why is that your problem?
[7316.42 --> 7321.12]  We, we, we didn't correctly anticipate how much it would cost to do this.
[7322.52 --> 7323.20]  That's okay.
[7323.36 --> 7323.82]  That's okay.
[7323.88 --> 7327.62]  Overall, the platform is sustainable and it's sustainable indefinitely.
[7327.62 --> 7336.26]  So it's not one of those things where we're, you know, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, it's dire.
[7336.54 --> 7338.34]  You know, we don't have to change anything.
[7338.48 --> 7338.66]  Yeah.
[7338.66 --> 7339.98]  So we're just going to keep doing what we do.
[7340.02 --> 7340.28]  All right.
[7341.26 --> 7344.78]  I'm really trying to figure out how much money they make.
[7344.84 --> 7350.60]  There's, there's this like one random website I found, but I can't really tell what it's saying.
[7350.60 --> 7362.98]  But CNN makes incredible amounts of money, like, like 10,000 subscribers, even if those subscribers were paying like a hundred dollars a month, I don't think, I don't think would be extremely impactful for CNN.
[7363.24 --> 7364.68]  They were looking for millions.
[7364.88 --> 7367.26]  They were not looking for under 10,000.
[7367.26 --> 7377.48]  Um, so this, this, like the, the level of failure that this was, I think even when people reacted, they're like, Whoa, that's crazy.
[7377.48 --> 7383.58]  I think the level of failure was still lost on those people because this is really intense levels of failure.
[7384.12 --> 7391.62]  Um, to, to the point where like, I actually don't even understand how they managed to do it so poorly.
[7391.62 --> 7397.70]  Like, I don't know how you could have a machine that's that big, that's moving, that's hitting that many eyeballs.
[7397.70 --> 7398.66]  It's doing that many things.
[7398.66 --> 7401.30]  And you turn less than 10,000 subscribers.
[7401.54 --> 7403.46]  I mean, would you pay for CNN plus?
[7403.66 --> 7408.06]  No, maybe that's the problem.
[7408.18 --> 7408.96]  I don't know.
[7409.58 --> 7411.30]  Uh, but yeah.
[7412.78 --> 7413.62]  All right.
[7414.96 --> 7415.82]  Let's go ahead.
[7415.92 --> 7419.82]  Is this a picture of a primes, uh, OG, OG tier?
[7419.92 --> 7420.04]  Yeah.
[7420.04 --> 7420.66]  Thanks for that.
[7420.66 --> 7421.12]  A prime.
[7421.12 --> 7425.96]  Um, I mean, you work here, you get, you can get a free flow plane membership if you want anyway, but whatever.
[7426.14 --> 7426.88]  No, I think it is.
[7426.96 --> 7428.56]  I think it's a screenshot of his free membership.
[7429.76 --> 7430.12]  Okay.
[7430.32 --> 7435.48]  Is it time for us to talk about Tesla using engineering samples in their cars?
[7436.64 --> 7437.68]  Uh, sure.
[7439.18 --> 7439.52]  Why not?
[7439.52 --> 7441.88]  Can I just say, I don't want this to be political.
[7442.02 --> 7442.76]  Why not?
[7444.20 --> 7444.56]  Okay.
[7444.56 --> 7444.68]  Okay.
[7445.04 --> 7446.56]  I don't consider it to be political.
[7446.56 --> 7447.04]  Uh,
[7447.04 --> 7462.40]  using an engineering sample chip in a finished product, an engineering sample chip that has not yet passed necessary FCC certification and shipping that to paying customers.
[7462.40 --> 7465.84]  Well, I'm, I'm right wing.
[7465.84 --> 7467.72]  I'm not mad.
[7467.72 --> 7469.82]  I'm left wing.
[7469.98 --> 7470.56]  So I'm mad.
[7470.68 --> 7472.22]  No, no, it's just bad.
[7472.22 --> 7474.22]  It doesn't matter.
[7474.22 --> 7475.34]  It's just bad.
[7475.34 --> 7488.58]  Um, according to green, the only on Twitter, Tesla has been shipping engineering sample modem chips in all units of the model S plaid model freeze and model wise.
[7488.58 --> 7495.54]  This means that Tesla allegedly could be using hardware in their cars that has not yet been verified by the FCC.
[7496.12 --> 7513.48]  Apparently the quick tell AG five 25 R dash GL was approved by the FCC in October of 2020, but all of the cars that green, the only has checked have the ES declaration and engineering sample marking, uh, on the spreader.
[7513.48 --> 7522.46]  Uh, it is possible that Tesla has been leaning on ES chips to alleviate some of the pressure of the chip shortage.
[7523.20 --> 7527.90]  There are questions of whether ES chips are ready to stand up to regular use.
[7528.12 --> 7532.86]  If they are not, Tesla might have to recall thousands of cars, including those sold in China.
[7533.10 --> 7537.40]  Although this will only be a thing if the government ultimately looks into it.
[7538.80 --> 7542.14]  Oh, it says all the cars that green, the only has checked.
[7542.24 --> 7543.24]  How many cars has he checked?
[7543.48 --> 7548.66]  Uh, presumably more than two because otherwise it would be both.
[7549.62 --> 7549.76]  Right.
[7550.80 --> 7554.02]  It's also possible that these chips were made before October, 2020.
[7554.26 --> 7558.46]  So they just had to be labeled engineering sample, but now they're totally fine to use in production.
[7558.62 --> 7560.40]  That is actually possible.
[7561.72 --> 7567.22]  Alternately, alternatively, they might be using chips that are marked ES and aren't FCC compliant.
[7567.22 --> 7572.74]  But since Tesla doesn't answer questions, I'm not really expecting them to say anything about this.
[7574.08 --> 7574.96]  Fair enough.
[7574.96 --> 7577.18]  I mean, you know what?
[7577.18 --> 7577.58]  Okay.
[7578.30 --> 7578.78]  You know what?
[7578.96 --> 7582.44]  I'm going to, I'm going to present, I'm going to present a devil's advocate argument here.
[7582.58 --> 7599.28]  Uh, there are also allegedly, um, large companies going out and buying consumer electronics, both new and used, so that they can scavenge them for chips, including things like, uh, washing machines and dryers.
[7599.28 --> 7603.32]  So, so is it, is it ethical?
[7603.56 --> 7613.02]  Is it, is it, should it be legal to sell an end user a supposedly new product that contains a chip that you like melted down a dishwasher and desoldered?
[7613.02 --> 7615.08]  But you can put it in that.
[7615.72 --> 7616.74]  That doesn't sound.
[7616.74 --> 7619.60]  I mean, clearly desperate times, desperate times, desperate measures, right?
[7619.80 --> 7623.34]  That doesn't sound very, uh, viable.
[7623.70 --> 7640.90]  I, I didn't dive into that article very deeply, but yeah, I, um, this one's interesting to me because like it was mentioned, like if this is manufactured in the exact same way as the released version, uh, I mean, right now during a chip shortage, I would personally kind of rather that they were used.
[7640.90 --> 7650.08]  Like if it's, if it's the exact same thing, but like you said, they were just manufactured early before they were approved, I'd rather they were actually used than just like thrown away.
[7650.62 --> 7657.60]  Um, and if it's exact same thing, just one has text that says engineering sample on it and one doesn't, then why do I care?
[7657.70 --> 7664.46]  It's a bit of a concerning path to go down because people can just claim that it's the same, even though it's not.
[7664.58 --> 7664.82]  Yep.
[7665.14 --> 7665.88]  Um, sure.
[7665.94 --> 7666.16]  Good.
[7666.72 --> 7670.70]  But I mean, if they're not doing that, then I don't really have a problem with it personally.
[7670.90 --> 7675.98]  I mean, it's not like we've never rolled an engineering sample chip in production hardware.
[7676.16 --> 7677.72]  The difference is that we knew it was there.
[7677.88 --> 7678.66]  We put it there.
[7679.26 --> 7679.40]  Yeah.
[7682.12 --> 7682.52]  Yep.
[7683.96 --> 7685.48]  So that's pretty cool.
[7685.48 --> 7689.22]  In other news, and boy, this is going to be a hot take, unfortunately.
[7691.22 --> 7693.58]  Wait, Tesla overturned their, okay.
[7693.72 --> 7693.78]  Yeah.
[7693.84 --> 7698.74]  In other news, Tesla has stopped shipping cars with charging hardware included.
[7698.74 --> 7705.00]  They have overturned their policy to deliver every vehicle with a mobile charging cable and are now selling them separately.
[7705.20 --> 7712.42]  Prices are $400 for a level two charger and $200 for which one?
[7713.44 --> 7714.82]  Uh, is that a level one charger?
[7715.28 --> 7720.44]  Based on feedback received, we will drop mobile connector price to $200 and make it easy to order with a car.
[7720.44 --> 7720.56]  Sure.
[7721.08 --> 7721.40]  Okay.
[7721.40 --> 7721.46]  Okay.
[7722.46 --> 7738.92]  So, my take on this, which I actually posted on Twitter a little while ago, was, honestly, I don't actually see this as, as, I had a lot, I had more than one person pointing out that it would be hypocritical of me to do anything other than condemn this move.
[7739.34 --> 7743.08]  Because I was so critical of Apple for pulling the charger from the iPhone.
[7743.08 --> 7743.86]  That's not the same thing.
[7743.96 --> 7744.78]  That's not the same thing at all.
[7744.88 --> 7746.48]  This is specifically a mobile charger.
[7746.62 --> 7749.32]  This is not the standard one that goes into your house.
[7749.32 --> 7751.38]  Oh, no, it is.
[7751.38 --> 7756.38]  The mobile connector is not needed if you have a Tesla wall connector or use superchargers.
[7757.66 --> 7759.80]  Uh, yeah, but you have to, like, buy those, too.
[7760.10 --> 7763.50]  So, basically, it means that out of the box, there is no way to charge your car.
[7763.68 --> 7763.98]  Okay.
[7765.10 --> 7765.70]  As it is.
[7765.86 --> 7773.90]  But the reason that it's not comparable from my point of view is, A, my issue with Apple was actually never really the removal of the charger.
[7773.90 --> 7776.70]  My issue was that they didn't alter the price.
[7776.88 --> 7781.54]  So, they were just basically taking your money that they used to give you a charger for and just keeping it.
[7782.18 --> 7784.56]  And them not being honest about it.
[7784.68 --> 7785.48]  They weren't up front.
[7786.08 --> 7789.64]  They said, this is about the environment, man.
[7790.28 --> 7794.48]  This is about saving the environment from all these extra chargers.
[7794.48 --> 7798.48]  But it was never about that.
[7798.96 --> 7799.02]  No.
[7799.30 --> 7799.62]  Never.
[7800.06 --> 7801.52]  It was about saving a dollar.
[7802.10 --> 7804.76]  And stop pretending that it was about saving the environment.
[7804.88 --> 7809.14]  Because if it was about saving the environment, they could have made it optional for you to get a charger.
[7809.68 --> 7811.48]  And it would have, could have been the same price.
[7812.06 --> 7814.00]  That would have been about saving the environment.
[7814.16 --> 7816.42]  So, Apple was just extremely disingenuous about it.
[7816.42 --> 7824.98]  The other difference is that an iPhone is a device that needs to be charged every day to be realistically used the way the average consumer would use it.
[7825.42 --> 7832.50]  A car, depending on your usage, might not need to be charged more often than once a week, once every two weeks, even once a month, depending on how much you drive it.
[7832.98 --> 7838.98]  And so, you could conceivably make the argument that you could buy a Tesla and never actually own a charger for it.
[7839.34 --> 7844.74]  You could just charge at public charging stations or at work or whatever else.
[7844.74 --> 7849.78]  In fact, we have employees who drive Teslas who cannot charge at home.
[7850.56 --> 7852.30]  Who only charge at work.
[7853.90 --> 7854.42]  Really?
[7854.80 --> 7855.52]  And so, yeah.
[7855.78 --> 7862.32]  This is not actually a product that technically requires a charger for use.
[7864.04 --> 7864.68]  Yeah.
[7865.44 --> 7869.82]  And like, I mean, it didn't include whatever the Tesla wall charger.
[7870.02 --> 7871.14]  I'm not very familiar with this stuff.
[7871.14 --> 7875.58]  It didn't include the one that you would normally use in your house, as far as my understanding goes.
[7877.58 --> 7879.04]  So, like, you're buying that anyways.
[7881.20 --> 7885.50]  So, my take on this was just like, yeah, honestly, I kind of get it.
[7885.90 --> 7891.14]  I think that it sucks that it's kind of a stealthy way to issue a price increase.
[7891.22 --> 7896.30]  Yeah, it would have been nice if the cost of the car went down by like...
[7896.30 --> 7896.54]  Sure.
[7896.64 --> 7897.70]  But let's talk about...
[7897.70 --> 7899.84]  I mean, no cars are going down in price right now.
[7899.94 --> 7900.08]  No.
[7900.08 --> 7906.60]  You can literally drive off the lot in a Toyota Sienna and sell it for $10,000 more than what you paid.
[7907.00 --> 7907.24]  Yeah.
[7907.74 --> 7909.26]  Like, that's just not a thing right now.
[7909.44 --> 7916.66]  And it's a lot better than the situation around like, man, don't get me started on car dealerships and the U.S. legislation around car dealerships.
[7916.66 --> 7916.90]  Oh, yeah.
[7916.90 --> 7919.08]  And protecting that whole business model.
[7919.52 --> 7923.60]  Like, you know, you want to talk about really crappy anti-consumer situations.
[7923.60 --> 7935.68]  Let's talk about how buying a Mustang Mach-E involves paying way over Ford's advertised price when they do a national ad because of the behavior of their dealer network,
[7935.68 --> 7943.54]  who they have absolutely no way of controlling and no way of circumventing because of this utterly broken nonsense.
[7944.88 --> 7954.08]  But I shouldn't say law because it's actually more of like a framework of laws that exists to protect this, like, completely outdated business model.
[7954.72 --> 7954.80]  Yeah.
[7956.06 --> 7957.42]  Like, man, it is...
[7957.42 --> 7961.70]  You ever want to go down a rabbit hole and end up extremely angry?
[7962.58 --> 7962.86]  Okay?
[7962.86 --> 7971.78]  Go read about the protective laws around the car dealership industry in the U.S.
[7972.48 --> 7974.28]  It's bad.
[7974.92 --> 7975.08]  Yeah.
[7977.52 --> 7978.46]  Oh, man.
[7978.64 --> 7979.52]  Yeah, it's weird.
[7979.70 --> 7983.24]  I haven't looked into it so much, but I know a little bit about it and it's very weird.
[7985.90 --> 7991.12]  Yeah, I can't actually find my initial hot take, but some people were really outraged with me about it.
[7991.12 --> 7991.86]  I was like, what?
[7991.86 --> 7992.86]  Like, it's...
[7992.86 --> 7995.94]  Yeah, it's not the only car that's, like, going up in price.
[7996.04 --> 7996.74]  Like, what do you want?
[7997.86 --> 7998.48]  Yeah, okay, there.
[7998.56 --> 8002.44]  I said, it doesn't even need to be charged every day and they're charging infrastructures top tier.
[8002.78 --> 8004.90]  Third-party chargers are readily available.
[8005.26 --> 8008.86]  That's another really important thing is you don't actually...
[8009.82 --> 8018.24]  If Tesla is assigning a $400 value to this thing, then maybe you are better off with them putting that $400 of value on something else if you can get a deal on a charger somewhere else.
[8018.24 --> 8020.78]  I said third-party chargers are readily available.
[8020.96 --> 8022.44]  I never touch my OEM charger.
[8022.52 --> 8022.96]  That's true.
[8023.24 --> 8028.00]  Because I'd rather have a faster one that I purchased aftermarket that is fixed in my garage.
[8028.10 --> 8028.86]  I just never use it.
[8028.86 --> 8031.18]  Yeah.
[8032.62 --> 8033.18]  Fair enough.
[8033.46 --> 8034.46]  That's what I'm saying.
[8034.52 --> 8036.02]  It's like, I'm not familiar with...
[8036.02 --> 8036.70]  I don't have a Tesla.
[8036.78 --> 8037.38]  I never owned a Tesla.
[8037.50 --> 8039.00]  I haven't looked into buying a Tesla.
[8039.00 --> 8050.14]  But it's my understanding that the mobile charger is not the standard one that you will usually use in your house and stuff.
[8050.78 --> 8051.26]  Okay.
[8052.42 --> 8053.46]  Inferno 011.
[8054.74 --> 8058.48]  Linus, by the way, Elon advocates for getting rid of dealerships.
[8058.56 --> 8060.00]  Yeah, but it's not some kind of white knight...
[8060.86 --> 8063.00]  It's not a white knight pro-consumer stance.
[8063.00 --> 8066.00]  Dealerships actively...
[8067.00 --> 8072.12]  The dealership laws that I'm thinking about actively interfere with Tesla just selling more cars.
[8073.14 --> 8079.00]  So whether he actually cares about the average person and the struggles and the impact this has on them...
[8080.46 --> 8082.06]  Impossible to say.
[8082.52 --> 8087.50]  It's just very clear that there's also another agenda there for Elon.
[8087.50 --> 8092.66]  He doesn't get any brownie points for advocating for things that help make his company more money.
[8093.00 --> 8094.04]  That's not how this works.
[8094.48 --> 8094.58]  Yeah.
[8097.24 --> 8101.08]  Are we ready to talk about the GPU scalpocalypse actually being over?
[8101.52 --> 8103.86]  Can I hot take again?
[8104.26 --> 8105.94]  Yeah, because I feel like...
[8105.94 --> 8106.38]  Are you ready?
[8106.54 --> 8107.56]  I might have one as well.
[8107.66 --> 8108.46]  But yeah, go for it.
[8109.36 --> 8109.74]  Okay.
[8109.90 --> 8114.78]  For the first time in over a year, GPU pricing is down to just 12% above MSRP in Europe.
[8114.78 --> 8116.44]  Specifically in Germany and Austria.
[8117.36 --> 8122.68]  German tech news site 3D Center recently published their findings analyzing the price trends over time with detailed tracking.
[8122.68 --> 8123.96]  From January of 2021.
[8124.54 --> 8132.52]  They show the initial spike in demand following a boom in Ethereum pricing followed by a slower increase in spite of high ETH pricing thanks to increasing supply, blah, blah, blah, etc, etc, etc.
[8132.78 --> 8137.62]  If this trend continues, GPU prices may be mostly normalized by May, June.
[8138.48 --> 8145.78]  It is worth noting that 3D Center excluded the 3090 Ti from the graph since it wasn't available until recently and arguably isn't really all that available anyway.
[8145.92 --> 8146.30]  Fair enough.
[8146.30 --> 8147.86]  All right.
[8148.30 --> 8160.26]  With averages across the lineup falling, one GPU has stood out as consistently above MSRP, the 3080, which is highly sought after as the reasonable high-end option, at least compared to the astronomical pricing of the 3090 and 6900 XT.
[8160.72 --> 8168.30]  And Anthony notes anecdotally, local computer shops are still selling way above MSRP for both teams, but prices are getting lower.
[8168.30 --> 8173.82]  Here is my tinfoil hat conspiracy theory hot take.
[8173.90 --> 8174.64]  Are you ready for it?
[8174.74 --> 8175.00]  Yes.
[8175.32 --> 8176.24]  We'll see if it's the same as mine.
[8176.98 --> 8183.82]  It is late April, which was supposedly Intel's launch date for ARK.
[8183.82 --> 8188.12]  So the whole thing, the whole thing was fake.
[8188.90 --> 8191.42]  There was no, there was no inflation.
[8191.70 --> 8194.66]  There was no increase in component prices.
[8195.26 --> 8200.34]  It was just what the market will bear and you, the consumer can go yourself.
[8200.34 --> 8209.50]  Because if they were able to turn on the spigot, that like the timing is so perfect.
[8209.70 --> 8210.82]  The ARK's not here yet.
[8211.04 --> 8214.90]  So I think a lot of people might not necessarily put this together.
[8215.20 --> 8215.66]  Right.
[8216.16 --> 8218.32]  But this is when ARK was supposed to arrive.
[8218.32 --> 8228.18]  So the fact that ARK isn't here yet means we're not like quite at what prices are supposed to be because there isn't actually a competitor to respond to.
[8228.52 --> 8236.02]  But they clearly have built enough boards and altered the flow of these cards.
[8236.10 --> 8238.86]  Because you got to remember, these are decisions that are made months ahead of time.
[8238.92 --> 8239.08]  Right.
[8239.14 --> 8239.88]  These are projections.
[8240.24 --> 8240.40]  Yeah.
[8240.48 --> 8245.18]  We are seeing cards in the market today that were projected anywhere from three to nine months ago.
[8245.18 --> 8245.44]  Right.
[8245.44 --> 8254.24]  So they had no way of knowing that the production that they were doing today was not going to have a competitor to compete with.
[8254.84 --> 8265.30]  So like it's still going to drive pricing down because there is still competition between board partners, for example, who all want to shift through the GPUs so they can get more allocation so they can sell more GPUs.
[8266.50 --> 8274.48]  But for NVIDIA and AMD themselves, they got to be kind of sitting there going, well, shoot, because ARK ain't actually here yet.
[8275.44 --> 8276.20]  But here we are.
[8276.72 --> 8279.14]  My version of this is I don't think it's over.
[8280.38 --> 8285.34]  I think this might be, and I could be wrong and I hope I am.
[8285.90 --> 8291.20]  But I think this might be a short breather between spikes.
[8291.20 --> 8299.48]  I think with the neon supply, as is noted in this document, impacting chip production.
[8299.48 --> 8305.98]  We read an article, I think it was a couple weeks ago, about how right now we're struggling with chips.
[8306.92 --> 8307.08]  Sorry.
[8308.08 --> 8311.28]  You know, maybe both, to be honest, knowing this community.
[8312.60 --> 8313.54]  But right now we're struggling.
[8313.54 --> 8315.18]  I have 39 problems, but it's thick ain't one.
[8316.06 --> 8318.66]  Right now we're struggling with chips.
[8319.62 --> 8322.76]  But it's looking like in the future we might be struggling with wafers.
[8323.90 --> 8327.24]  Because wafer production is potentially falling behind and yada, yada, yada.
[8327.24 --> 8327.52]  Yes.
[8327.52 --> 8334.42]  So, like, I have a feeling that we might be kind of finally like, okay, we have a little bit of a breather.
[8334.84 --> 8337.32]  And then people are going to go, oh, I can buy graphics cards again.
[8338.20 --> 8340.68]  Demand is going to potentially go back up because of that.
[8340.80 --> 8348.02]  And then we're going to run into this wafer trouble and this neon trouble and all this kind of stuff that's just looming around the corner.
[8348.02 --> 8351.66]  And I think we might spike back up in regards to GPU prices.
[8352.82 --> 8358.08]  Don't just, like, spend all your money on a GPU now and then scream at me in six months when the price doesn't go up.
[8358.52 --> 8361.44]  But I just, I have a feeling it's not over.
[8362.22 --> 8366.62]  At the end of the day, though, you know, how things are priced.
[8367.36 --> 8369.06]  A GPU is sand, you know.
[8369.86 --> 8370.56]  There's sand.
[8370.84 --> 8372.34]  There's production costs, right?
[8372.42 --> 8374.24]  There's R&D, right?
[8374.34 --> 8376.76]  There's the facility that it actually has to be built in.
[8376.76 --> 8378.78]  There are people that actually have to run this facility.
[8381.14 --> 8390.86]  That cost, that material and labor cost, is not reflective of what is charged for the final product.
[8390.94 --> 8398.48]  At the end of the day, it is priced based on what the market will bear, not priced based on what the actual cost is.
[8398.48 --> 8401.82]  So what we're learning is that, yes, inflation is a thing.
[8402.52 --> 8404.80]  Yes, materials prices are going up.
[8404.80 --> 8409.34]  But if push came to shove, there was enough margin in there that, like, they could have done it.
[8410.24 --> 8412.70]  So that's the tinfoil hat conspiracy theory.
[8412.70 --> 8414.28]  I mean, it's not really just sand, right?
[8414.40 --> 8417.28]  Like, you can't just, like, go to the beach and make a CPU.
[8417.28 --> 8418.14]  Yes, I know.
[8418.28 --> 8418.74]  I know.
[8418.96 --> 8432.84]  But the point is, I had a contractor tell me that there had been an increase from their 2021 to their 2022 rates of, like, 60% on some aspect of our bill.
[8432.84 --> 8434.54]  Due to inflation.
[8434.54 --> 8434.84]  Nice.
[8434.84 --> 8436.66]  And I'm sitting here going, oh, okay.
[8438.16 --> 8442.42]  Did that vehicle you already owned go up in price 60%?
[8443.06 --> 8448.62]  Did you actually give, if I go talk to the person driving it, did they get a 60% raise?
[8449.30 --> 8450.52]  You know, I just want to understand.
[8450.78 --> 8453.00]  What is inflation to you?
[8453.12 --> 8453.68]  No, that's good.
[8453.68 --> 8455.32]  Did your costs actually go up?
[8455.32 --> 8457.82]  Because our costs have gone up.
[8457.98 --> 8459.48]  LTT store, our costs have gone up.
[8459.58 --> 8462.90]  On water bottles, on T-shirts, on transport, they've gone up.
[8463.24 --> 8475.04]  But the thing you've got to understand is that when a cost on something goes up, that doesn't necessarily immediately mean that the end price just goes up by that amount.
[8475.04 --> 8478.40]  You know, when, okay, let's talk wafers.
[8478.84 --> 8485.98]  When wafer costs go up 200%, that doesn't mean that CPUs need to go up 200%.
[8485.98 --> 8486.24]  Yeah.
[8486.24 --> 8490.52]  Because of the cost of creating a CPU, that wafer might only be 2%.
[8490.52 --> 8500.40]  So when it goes up 200%, we might only be talking about, you know, a 4% increase in the total cost to produce this product.
[8500.70 --> 8507.68]  And when you look at the margins of a company like an Intel or an NVIDIA, could they have absorbed 4% for you?
[8508.12 --> 8508.82]  Yeah, they could have.
[8509.20 --> 8510.54]  They sure as heck didn't need to.
[8511.66 --> 8513.12]  Because you do the math the other way, right?
[8513.12 --> 8517.20]  If they actually do double the price, they are now making 96% more.
[8518.16 --> 8521.22]  Like it's, and I'm not saying those numbers are right.
[8521.44 --> 8523.98]  I'm saying that the truth is somewhere in between.
[8524.78 --> 8524.88]  Yeah.
[8524.94 --> 8528.66]  And everything that I listed was more of a like supply and demand situation, right?
[8528.68 --> 8532.90]  Like neon being less available as a supply and demand situation.
[8533.32 --> 8533.74]  The wafers.
[8533.76 --> 8534.74]  And that could raise costs.
[8535.06 --> 8535.22]  Yeah.
[8535.40 --> 8537.18]  And wafer production is very difficult.
[8538.16 --> 8542.94]  And like spinning up a new facility that can produce a wafer is not exactly the easiest thing ever.
[8543.12 --> 8545.60]  So there's going to be a supply and demand problem there as well.
[8545.98 --> 8553.30]  It's not necessarily, the costs aren't going to necessarily go up because acquiring a single unit of this item became more expensive.
[8553.64 --> 8556.94]  But it's going to go up because like people are going to buy it pretty much regardless.
[8558.06 --> 8560.28]  So you just increase the price.
[8560.88 --> 8561.86]  Just keep going up.
[8563.74 --> 8564.48]  That's how it works.
[8564.48 --> 8566.98]  All right.
[8567.10 --> 8568.58]  Well, we should do some merch messages.
[8568.88 --> 8568.98]  Yeah.
[8569.38 --> 8570.18]  Bell, are you there?
[8570.88 --> 8571.24]  Hello.
[8571.44 --> 8572.46]  He still is.
[8572.92 --> 8573.60]  I'm awake.
[8573.70 --> 8574.00]  I'm here.
[8574.02 --> 8574.56]  How are you doing?
[8576.00 --> 8577.36]  Let's go through some merch messages.
[8577.64 --> 8578.60]  This first one's from Joshua.
[8579.08 --> 8580.36]  And then let's cut this thing.
[8581.14 --> 8582.18]  From Joshua to Luke.
[8582.52 --> 8582.74]  Hey.
[8582.86 --> 8583.90]  You used to be named Slick.
[8584.14 --> 8584.34]  Yeah.
[8584.44 --> 8585.28]  Where did it come from?
[8585.32 --> 8586.02]  And where did it go?
[8586.02 --> 8589.08]  Where did it come from, Cotton Eye Joe?
[8589.82 --> 8591.42]  Linus used to nickname everyone.
[8591.44 --> 8592.66]  Don't get us copyright straight.
[8592.90 --> 8593.50]  Oh, sorry.
[8593.64 --> 8593.84]  Right.
[8594.68 --> 8596.18]  Linus used to nickname everyone.
[8596.68 --> 8597.66]  It was a thing.
[8598.06 --> 8602.54]  I feel like, honestly, they weren't that creative after mine.
[8604.44 --> 8604.92]  Ouch.
[8605.28 --> 8610.20]  Calling Brandon B-roll was not exactly like, you know, the most innovative thing ever.
[8610.20 --> 8615.72]  But yeah, I was called Slick because of Oil Slick, because of my oil-cooled computer.
[8617.88 --> 8621.88]  And it went away because we collectively decided that nicknames were stupid.
[8623.12 --> 8623.60]  Yeah.
[8623.94 --> 8628.00]  Actually, there was a peasant uprising, and I was informed that nicknames are stupid.
[8630.44 --> 8633.72]  I wanted it to be kind of like these personas, you know?
[8633.92 --> 8635.58]  And it was supposed to be branding.
[8635.58 --> 8641.98]  So, like, Luke was Slick because he was, like, the guy that's, like, crazy enough to build an oil PC.
[8642.44 --> 8645.94]  And Brandon was B-roll because he was, like, the guy with the B-roll.
[8646.16 --> 8647.80]  The guy that makes our video not suck.
[8648.18 --> 8648.70]  You know?
[8650.32 --> 8652.50]  Ed's nickname, Diesel, was just stupid.
[8652.68 --> 8653.00]  I forget.
[8653.12 --> 8656.06]  I think it's because I misread his name the first time I saw it.
[8656.16 --> 8656.34]  Yeah.
[8657.04 --> 8661.70]  I think you called him Diesel because you, like, read his name wrong or whatever.
[8661.84 --> 8662.38]  But, yeah.
[8664.00 --> 8664.38]  From Nicholas.
[8664.38 --> 8665.06]  From Nicholas.
[8665.58 --> 8666.44]  Linus or Luke.
[8666.78 --> 8673.06]  What has been the biggest failure while making a video in terms of something not working, breaking, or maybe where the video had to be junked?
[8673.94 --> 8683.66]  Oh, it's got to be the one where I dropped the $10,000 CPU that delayed the project for, like, three months and cost me thousands of dollars to go out of pocket, replace it.
[8684.92 --> 8685.74]  That's pretty brutal.
[8687.02 --> 8688.22]  I'm trying to think of...
[8689.28 --> 8690.02]  I don't know.
[8690.02 --> 8699.50]  I mean, there was the time that a sponsor basically threatened to sue us if we released the sponsored video we created for them.
[8699.50 --> 8703.12]  And we basically told them, like, we did what you said.
[8703.18 --> 8704.04]  You do need to pay.
[8704.44 --> 8706.84]  And then they went out of business, like, six months later.
[8706.94 --> 8707.64]  So that was interesting.
[8707.64 --> 8708.64]  That was fun.
[8708.64 --> 8712.72]  That was fun.
[8713.24 --> 8717.20]  Back when I was making videos, I think junking them wasn't actually an option.
[8717.60 --> 8719.44]  So I don't think this really applies.
[8719.44 --> 8724.58]  Because if we had a massive failure, we would just film the massive failure and then release it.
[8727.10 --> 8729.70]  I mean, cold room water cooling was a failure.
[8730.28 --> 8731.62]  That got released, dude.
[8731.90 --> 8732.46]  Heck yeah.
[8733.38 --> 8735.04]  Yeah, this wasn't actually an option.
[8735.14 --> 8736.38]  So I don't think I can actually answer.
[8736.58 --> 8739.88]  I don't think I worked on a project that didn't get released, like, immediately.
[8741.42 --> 8742.46]  Yeah, I don't know.
[8742.88 --> 8743.54]  It is what it is.
[8743.54 --> 8751.66]  I just so you guys know, merch messages happen when people check out on LTT Store while we are live.
[8751.80 --> 8753.40]  Maybe they're checking out these new...
[8753.40 --> 8756.52]  Holy crap, we have sold 420 water bottles.
[8756.82 --> 8757.20]  Let's go.
[8758.28 --> 8758.72]  Nice.
[8759.24 --> 8759.68]  Let's go.
[8759.94 --> 8762.58]  Yeah, so people checking out on LTT Store.com.
[8762.66 --> 8765.72]  And when we're live, there's a little field where you can enter a message.
[8765.72 --> 8768.70]  So we'd rather people do this rather than super chats.
[8769.04 --> 8771.12]  Because at least this way, you, like...
[8771.12 --> 8772.10]  Maybe we miss your message.
[8772.10 --> 8774.82]  But at least you, like, get something in the mail then.
[8776.80 --> 8777.24]  Nice.
[8777.44 --> 8778.16]  From Luis.
[8779.06 --> 8780.12]  Cereal and milk gang.
[8780.58 --> 8782.10]  What's your cereal of choice, Linus?
[8783.72 --> 8787.94]  Well, Luis actually asked what I'm eating, Mr. Editorializing over here.
[8788.56 --> 8790.74]  It's chicken soup with rice.
[8790.96 --> 8791.14]  Oh.
[8791.28 --> 8792.32]  Oh my once.
[8792.46 --> 8793.34]  Oh my twice.
[8793.72 --> 8795.28]  Oh my chicken soup with rice.
[8796.44 --> 8798.26]  That's a reference most people won't get.
[8798.26 --> 8804.82]  But anyway, normally I am a triple berry oatmeal crisp kind of guy.
[8804.96 --> 8806.48]  I also like that cranberry almond crunch.
[8806.58 --> 8809.92]  Love me some mini wheats with the classic frosting.
[8810.76 --> 8813.78]  If I'm, like, really being really bad, I love honey nut checks.
[8813.98 --> 8816.02]  Oh my God, the Nesquik cereal is so good.
[8817.04 --> 8817.52]  I just...
[8817.52 --> 8817.86]  You know what?
[8817.86 --> 8820.92]  Anything with homo milk in it is, like, delicious.
[8821.24 --> 8825.14]  Because, man, you put that skim milk in, you might as well just, like, dunk it in water.
[8826.32 --> 8826.86]  I'm sorry.
[8826.92 --> 8827.86]  I'm anti-skim milk.
[8828.08 --> 8828.32]  Yeah.
[8828.54 --> 8835.20]  See, this is one of the few arenas that Linus and I are actually on the opposite sides of when it comes to food.
[8835.32 --> 8837.02]  Usually we align almost exactly.
[8837.02 --> 8839.88]  But I like skim milk.
[8840.06 --> 8842.02]  I like skim milk because I was growing up on skim milk.
[8842.12 --> 8845.22]  I think that's kind of where the line gets created.
[8845.46 --> 8851.90]  Like, if this is the one that you have for the first X amount of years of your life, you're probably not going to want to switch later on down the line.
[8853.68 --> 8859.52]  Yeah, I mean, if all you've ever had is, like, warm piss to drink, then why would you have a couple of juice?
[8859.62 --> 8860.54]  I knew it was good.
[8860.94 --> 8864.08]  I think another part of it, too, is that I just don't really like milk in general.
[8864.08 --> 8868.48]  Like, I don't enjoy in any variety other than chocolate.
[8869.10 --> 8870.52]  Just like a glass of milk.
[8870.62 --> 8872.16]  I've never been into that in any form.
[8872.28 --> 8878.00]  So I think by not liking milk, having the least milky one probably makes the most sense.
[8878.92 --> 8880.52]  To be clear, I'm not a milk drinker either.
[8880.86 --> 8884.30]  I would never just, like, pour myself a glass of milk.
[8884.46 --> 8885.34]  No milk drinkers.
[8885.36 --> 8886.28]  Absolutely not.
[8886.38 --> 8887.26]  No milk drinkers.
[8887.92 --> 8893.84]  But, yeah, I think, I don't remember what the brand is, but it's, like, some lean crunch thing or something.
[8894.08 --> 8894.78]  For my cereal.
[8895.58 --> 8895.90]  Cachy.
[8896.14 --> 8896.60]  Lean crunch.
[8896.80 --> 8898.42]  Cachy go lean crunch or something.
[8898.62 --> 8899.46]  I really like the flavor.
[8899.76 --> 8900.10]  I don't know.
[8901.60 --> 8902.00]  Okay.
[8902.36 --> 8902.80]  Crunchy.
[8903.26 --> 8903.90]  I like crunchy.
[8904.20 --> 8907.68]  Man, I basically eat cereal as dessert slash candy.
[8908.96 --> 8910.42]  As often as I can.
[8910.62 --> 8913.02]  I, I, it is my, man, it is my week.
[8913.22 --> 8913.92]  It is my weakness.
[8913.92 --> 8917.48]  I like cereal, but, yeah, not, not at the.
[8917.60 --> 8919.36]  Someone just asked if I'm sitting in two chairs.
[8920.12 --> 8920.34]  Yes.
[8920.40 --> 8922.74]  How do you know any of the chairs are real?
[8922.82 --> 8923.38]  Two chairs.
[8923.86 --> 8925.58]  How do you, how do you know anything's real?
[8925.58 --> 8926.00]  Like.
[8926.00 --> 8937.46]  I hope I just blew everyone's mind.
[8942.14 --> 8942.54]  Okay.
[8942.66 --> 8942.82]  Sorry.
[8942.90 --> 8943.42]  Let's keep going.
[8944.12 --> 8944.88]  From Jordan.
[8945.32 --> 8946.18]  Hi, Daddy Linus.
[8946.28 --> 8947.24]  Shout out from Australia.
[8947.64 --> 8947.98]  Question.
[8948.20 --> 8951.32]  When international travel comes back, where's somewhere that you'd like to go?
[8951.32 --> 8954.74]  I'd love to go to Australia and I'm not even sucking up.
[8954.82 --> 8958.28]  I think the wife and I are going to go down there and like do some scuba diving.
[8958.68 --> 8961.02]  And we're, we're missing.
[8962.02 --> 8967.30]  It's how ironic to go all the way to Australia to go to a concert for a local artist.
[8967.30 --> 8969.18]  We're going to go see Michael Bublé in Australia.
[8970.68 --> 8971.34]  That's funny.
[8971.66 --> 8973.96]  He like literally lives an hour from my house.
[8974.22 --> 8978.10]  And for some reason, I'm going to fly 18 hours to watch him perform.
[8978.10 --> 8978.50]  From.
[8981.14 --> 8981.54]  From.
[8981.72 --> 8983.80]  Are you just going to keep blowing people's minds here, Luke?
[8984.08 --> 8984.42]  Yeah.
[8985.00 --> 8985.30]  Yeah.
[8988.60 --> 8991.80]  What a bad man.
[8994.54 --> 8995.42]  Oh, no.
[8996.50 --> 8998.86]  I think people didn't get it the first time.
[8999.64 --> 9000.86]  So maybe they'll get it now.
[9005.34 --> 9005.74]  Okay.
[9005.76 --> 9006.62]  Let's see if I can put them back.
[9006.70 --> 9006.82]  Sorry.
[9006.90 --> 9007.24]  Keep going.
[9007.36 --> 9007.66]  Keep going.
[9007.66 --> 9008.50]  More merch messages.
[9008.62 --> 9009.38]  No, keep hitting us.
[9009.44 --> 9010.60]  You can hit us more rapid fire.
[9010.78 --> 9011.00]  Okay.
[9011.26 --> 9016.08]  Nathaniel asks, have you ever thought about making a let's play or gaming focused channel
[9016.08 --> 9019.84]  and upload or upload gaming focused videos to channel super fun?
[9021.30 --> 9022.92]  I mean, I thought about it.
[9022.92 --> 9028.44]  Like if you remember back when channel super fun was first pitched, it was a, it was a
[9028.44 --> 9032.68]  battle between a gaming review channel and a like toy review channel.
[9033.52 --> 9034.04]  Yep.
[9034.50 --> 9036.52]  And gaming didn't win.
[9036.52 --> 9039.28]  I think that's because you vetoed it.
[9039.28 --> 9039.32]  I think that's because you vetoed it.
[9039.32 --> 9039.78]  No.
[9039.78 --> 9045.02]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[9045.22 --> 9045.64]  Wasn't it?
[9045.64 --> 9046.62]  I actually don't remember.
[9046.86 --> 9047.02]  You lost.
[9047.02 --> 9050.02]  You lost the community vote and it was not close.
[9050.02 --> 9055.88]  I don't think Luke and I both produced pilots for what channel super fun would be.
[9056.04 --> 9062.28]  And his was gaming and mine was like dinking around with toys and it wasn't close.
[9062.28 --> 9064.46]  All right.
[9064.46 --> 9064.78]  All right.
[9064.78 --> 9064.88]  All right.
[9064.88 --> 9065.16]  All right.
[9065.16 --> 9065.18]  All right.
[9065.18 --> 9067.66]  I have no way to like, I don't know where I would find this information.
[9067.66 --> 9068.28]  So whatever.
[9069.08 --> 9073.30]  From Kyra as a primo as primo tech professionals.
[9073.44 --> 9075.28]  Do you have any advice for young professionals in tech?
[9075.54 --> 9078.86]  I'm thinking about switching my major to CIT, but scared of the culture as a woman and any
[9078.86 --> 9079.58]  advice would be great.
[9079.58 --> 9081.46]  So here's the problem.
[9081.74 --> 9083.44]  I am not a tech professional.
[9085.92 --> 9087.76]  I know in, in.
[9088.02 --> 9089.28]  I'm a media professional.
[9090.00 --> 9091.28]  In my experience.
[9094.54 --> 9095.22]  Take it away.
[9095.38 --> 9095.54]  I don't know.
[9095.82 --> 9097.18]  I'm in such a bubble.
[9097.18 --> 9097.60]  Right.
[9097.74 --> 9098.66]  So I don't know.
[9098.98 --> 9103.86]  In my experience, like when I was, when I was in school, the women in my courses were,
[9104.22 --> 9106.48]  were, I would argue, highly respected.
[9106.48 --> 9113.80]  Um, but I have also heard quite a bit that that is not the experience that a lot of women
[9113.80 --> 9114.56]  in tech have had.
[9114.90 --> 9115.92]  And that sucks.
[9116.46 --> 9121.28]  Um, I know that we've, I've honestly, I've honestly tried at flow plane, but like to,
[9121.36 --> 9128.56]  to give some inside baseball over the last two, like, so for data science and software
[9128.56 --> 9131.90]  engineering, two of the positions that we've been hiring for recently for the software
[9131.90 --> 9137.82]  engineering one out of the resumes that I got just, and obviously I can't really tell.
[9138.06 --> 9139.56]  I don't even want to see people's pictures.
[9139.76 --> 9140.20]  I don't care.
[9140.24 --> 9144.18]  It has nothing to do with the hiring process, but just by judging from the names, I think
[9144.18 --> 9147.60]  one woman applied out of 2,500 applicants.
[9148.18 --> 9149.04]  So it's rough.
[9149.06 --> 9153.36]  And I would encourage you to go into the field if it's something that you like.
[9153.36 --> 9158.38]  Um, because having more female representation would be awesome.
[9159.16 --> 9162.08]  Um, I, I hate that.
[9162.22 --> 9167.80]  I am a little bit hesitant to say that just because you might have to deal with some stuff
[9167.80 --> 9169.70]  that is not fair and not cool.
[9169.70 --> 9174.62]  And I don't want to like push you down a path that might be extremely uncomfortable, but it
[9174.62 --> 9178.62]  would be really cool to have more female representation in this field.
[9178.62 --> 9181.18]  And I mean, I think it would be really good.
[9181.50 --> 9184.70]  So if you decide to pursue it, I can give you one bit of advice.
[9185.28 --> 9192.52]  Don't give a bunch of your money to some recruitment agency because you are like in demand.
[9192.78 --> 9192.94]  Yeah.
[9193.76 --> 9193.98]  Yeah.
[9194.80 --> 9199.12]  So yeah, all I'm saying is get, get the whole bag.
[9199.28 --> 9199.70]  All right.
[9199.96 --> 9206.96]  There's lots of places that, that, uh, appreciate the, the idea of a multitude and a wider range
[9206.96 --> 9211.54]  of perspectives, uh, when you, when you're trying to be innovative and create things and
[9211.54 --> 9216.06]  move forward, um, and lots of places that, that will want you on their team.
[9216.50 --> 9221.58]  Um, so you don't have to like, this, this is just something that Linus and I found a while
[9221.58 --> 9224.74]  ago, but you don't have to like pay people to join a recruitment agency.
[9226.02 --> 9227.84]  Like you'll, you'll, you'll be fine.
[9229.00 --> 9229.68]  Oh yeah.
[9229.68 --> 9237.92]  Like if you are anywhere and if you're anywhere near capable, like get out there, pound the
[9237.92 --> 9238.30]  pavement.
[9238.30 --> 9242.90]  It is a, it is a, an employee's market right now in that space.
[9242.90 --> 9243.26]  Yeah.
[9243.30 --> 9246.78]  Get some, get some experience under your belt, but you can do that while getting well paid.
[9246.78 --> 9249.08]  Like there's, there's a lot of demand in the industry right now.
[9249.26 --> 9254.16]  Um, uh, it's just for some inside baseball on, on me.
[9254.16 --> 9257.54]  I like hiring more based on portfolios than education.
[9257.96 --> 9260.44]  Um, it's a little bit harder to, you said CIT.
[9260.70 --> 9266.22]  It's a little bit harder to get a portfolio, a public viewable portfolio built in the CIT
[9266.22 --> 9267.98]  space specifically, but it is possible.
[9268.58 --> 9270.46]  Um, yeah.
[9271.46 --> 9271.94]  Yeah.
[9272.12 --> 9273.04]  That's all I'd say, I guess.
[9274.10 --> 9274.54]  Awesome.
[9274.74 --> 9277.10]  From Sherry, what are your thoughts on star citizen?
[9277.28 --> 9279.26]  Now that it's been almost a year since your live stream.
[9281.82 --> 9283.66]  I haven't touched it since then.
[9284.16 --> 9289.32]  So my thoughts are wake me up when not wake me up when it's over, wake me up when it's
[9289.32 --> 9290.28]  not over anymore.
[9290.56 --> 9290.96]  I guess.
[9291.26 --> 9291.70]  Yeah.
[9292.24 --> 9294.98]  Um, I constantly see content.
[9295.22 --> 9299.54]  Like I'll see somebody release like a little clip of them doing something that's like super
[9299.54 --> 9300.00]  cool.
[9300.32 --> 9301.42]  And I'm like, sweet.
[9301.46 --> 9304.48]  I really hope the server didn't crash like two minutes after you did that.
[9304.98 --> 9307.38]  Um, I don't know.
[9307.56 --> 9314.14]  Uh, I, I, I, I do not currently have hope, but the only reason why I don't currently have
[9314.14 --> 9317.14]  hope is because I just don't think about it at all.
[9317.92 --> 9322.12]  Um, and I'm just waiting for like, they're going to say like, you know what?
[9322.62 --> 9323.50]  It's ready.
[9323.50 --> 9325.60]  And I'm going to be like, okay, sweet, let's go.
[9325.70 --> 9327.44]  And I'll be really excited for when that happens.
[9327.44 --> 9332.38]  But I think it's just better for me to just not care in the slightest until that happens
[9332.38 --> 9337.08]  because it's been a long time of waiting and I just don't feel like actively waiting
[9337.08 --> 9337.42]  anymore.
[9337.66 --> 9339.10]  So I'm no longer actively waiting.
[9340.04 --> 9344.52]  Nicholas D asks, uh, what are your thoughts on autonomous rideshare companies, Cruise,
[9344.66 --> 9346.10]  Waymo, Zoox and such?
[9346.10 --> 9355.48]  Man, I think we are, I've yet to see evidence that we are that close to autonomous vehicles
[9355.48 --> 9357.78]  that can actually handle every edge case.
[9357.90 --> 9360.62]  I think that this is going to be an extremely complicated decade.
[9361.32 --> 9362.46]  We'll see how it goes.
[9362.62 --> 9367.90]  Obviously that's a future that I'm excited for, but I think it's still a future that I'm
[9367.90 --> 9368.56]  excited for.
[9368.66 --> 9371.78]  Not something that is, it's happening right now, but we'll see.
[9371.78 --> 9376.40]  I mean, Tesla's apparently confident enough that they're not even allowing people to buy
[9376.40 --> 9377.36]  out their leases anymore.
[9378.06 --> 9382.48]  If I'm not, I'm not even sure if they ever did, but they want every vehicle back supposedly
[9382.48 --> 9384.02]  for their robo taxi service.
[9384.12 --> 9384.64]  So we'll see.
[9386.38 --> 9389.52]  Uh, from Kevin, sorry if that's wrong.
[9390.18 --> 9391.74]  Uh, long time watcher, first time buyer.
[9392.04 --> 9393.96]  What podcast do you listen to Linus and Luke?
[9395.02 --> 9395.94]  I think I'd be surprised.
[9395.94 --> 9396.96]  I don't even listen to this one.
[9397.10 --> 9397.66]  Listen to podcasts.
[9397.84 --> 9398.08]  Yeah.
[9398.40 --> 9399.30]  Do you listen to any?
[9400.66 --> 9401.06]  No.
[9401.78 --> 9403.00]  Honestly, I don't get it.
[9403.48 --> 9404.18]  I don't get it.
[9404.22 --> 9405.24]  I don't get long format.
[9405.48 --> 9406.28]  I don't have time.
[9406.78 --> 9407.74]  I can't.
[9407.82 --> 9408.40]  I was not.
[9408.42 --> 9409.08]  I love you all.
[9409.18 --> 9409.98]  Thank you for watching.
[9410.22 --> 9411.98]  I mean, I don't love you all like literally.
[9412.66 --> 9415.12]  Um, you know, I just, I appreciate you.
[9415.24 --> 9416.36]  I appreciate you a lot.
[9416.36 --> 9417.26]  I'll say that.
[9417.42 --> 9420.76]  I, uh, yeah, I didn't listen to the fact that you're here.
[9421.60 --> 9422.04]  Yeah.
[9422.06 --> 9423.26]  Your, your, your presence.
[9423.44 --> 9424.04]  Maybe I should say.
[9424.52 --> 9428.42]  Um, I didn't listen to podcasts either until very recently.
[9428.42 --> 9435.16]  Uh, I don't think it's too much of a mystery, but I added a little bit of poundage over the,
[9435.16 --> 9436.88]  over the quarantine period.
[9437.06 --> 9442.90]  Uh, and I've been working quite a bit lately to lose said poundage and re-up a little bit
[9442.90 --> 9444.14]  of the muscle and stuff like that.
[9444.14 --> 9451.62]  And one of the things that I've been doing is I, I go for walk, run, jog, be active out in the
[9451.62 --> 9452.72]  field for an hour.
[9453.08 --> 9463.96]  Um, and I've been listening to, man, uh, I've been listening to the yard a lot and past gas,
[9463.96 --> 9467.60]  and I'm looking for other podcasts as well.
[9467.84 --> 9470.08]  I love that sentence out of context.
[9470.08 --> 9474.26]  I've been listening to the yard a lot and past gas.
[9475.30 --> 9475.66]  Yeah.
[9475.72 --> 9477.96]  Neither of them have like, you know, the most.
[9477.96 --> 9480.26]  You actually sound like a crazy person.
[9481.40 --> 9481.76]  Yeah.
[9481.86 --> 9482.28]  I don't know.
[9482.86 --> 9483.74]  I like them though.
[9483.82 --> 9484.70]  I try to time it.
[9484.80 --> 9489.42]  So I try to make sure that I'm out there and like some days I'll have more energy and
[9489.42 --> 9490.32]  some days I'll have less.
[9490.70 --> 9493.96]  Um, but I'll try to make sure that I'm at least out there for an hour every time.
[9493.96 --> 9501.32]  Um, and I listen for, yeah, I listen for the hour and then I usually try to make sure that
[9501.32 --> 9504.72]  like, um, I, I do a cool down period of 10 minutes every time.
[9504.80 --> 9506.64]  So technically I'm outside for an hour and 10 minutes, whatever.
[9506.76 --> 9509.32]  But my cool down period is purely walking just for 10 minutes.
[9509.92 --> 9514.20]  Um, and then I go inside and I listened to the rest of the podcast, like while I'm having
[9514.20 --> 9520.24]  a shower or whatever, but I like the routine and it has the listening to the podcast and
[9520.24 --> 9522.06]  getting notifications for new episodes.
[9522.06 --> 9527.90]  Like whenever I get a notification for new episode of the yard, I, it, it, it makes me
[9527.90 --> 9531.28]  more excited to go out for my one hour of field time.
[9531.28 --> 9532.14]  If that makes sense.
[9532.44 --> 9534.46]  Um, you can listen to the yard.
[9534.64 --> 9535.04]  Yeah.
[9535.14 --> 9536.34]  So that, that's been cool.
[9536.40 --> 9537.08]  Pass some gas.
[9537.24 --> 9540.48]  But honestly, if I wasn't doing that, I don't think I'd listen to any podcast.
[9540.48 --> 9548.24]  I, podcasts and streams are, are two things that I've just never really, uh, I just never
[9548.24 --> 9549.50]  really got it, I guess.
[9549.68 --> 9550.04]  I don't know.
[9550.04 --> 9554.60]  But you do listen to they're just movies, tech linked and the WAN show all available
[9554.60 --> 9556.18]  where you listen to podcasts.
[9556.38 --> 9557.26]  Of course.
[9557.52 --> 9557.84]  Yeah.
[9557.98 --> 9561.88]  I did figure out very recently that not only those, but oh, right.
[9561.92 --> 9562.66]  No, you mentioned it.
[9562.72 --> 9563.18]  Tech linked.
[9563.38 --> 9565.78]  I had no idea that tech linked was in podcast form.
[9566.00 --> 9566.32]  Yeah.
[9566.46 --> 9567.62]  Um, it actually came up.
[9567.72 --> 9568.44]  I didn't know that either.
[9568.70 --> 9570.20]  When I was looking for podcast.
[9570.20 --> 9571.76]  It kind of makes sense.
[9571.76 --> 9575.96]  Cause you can, I'm learning a lot in the past, like few weeks about podcasts in general.
[9575.96 --> 9576.56]  I had no idea.
[9576.56 --> 9580.36]  I was not a podcast person, but you can subscribe to them and they'll just queue up automatically
[9580.36 --> 9580.84]  for you.
[9581.72 --> 9582.22]  So yeah.
[9582.22 --> 9583.52]  If you're just going out like, yeah.
[9583.52 --> 9583.78]  Okay.
[9583.78 --> 9586.18]  Tech linked is super short, but it's just queued up.
[9586.22 --> 9588.36]  You don't have to like manipulate your phone in any way.
[9588.36 --> 9589.26]  It'll just play.
[9589.40 --> 9590.78]  And then once it's done, it'll play the next one.
[9591.14 --> 9591.98]  So it makes sense.
[9592.14 --> 9592.26]  Yeah.
[9592.32 --> 9593.14]  Check it out.
[9594.12 --> 9595.72]  Um, got a couple of things here.
[9595.90 --> 9601.94]  Uh, Tim, Tim, uh, in float plane chat last night, I played star citizen and saw a bartender
[9601.94 --> 9604.52]  NPC pour a draft beer fully animated.
[9604.68 --> 9605.54]  It was fantastic.
[9606.40 --> 9609.02]  Then I got stuck in my ship and no button would work anymore.
[9612.30 --> 9614.54]  I was going to say like, yeah, that's super cool.
[9614.62 --> 9616.10]  And someone posted in chat earlier.
[9616.10 --> 9618.00]  It's like, oh, you can do ship to ship refueling.
[9618.00 --> 9619.10]  And I'm like, yeah, sweet.
[9619.50 --> 9620.52]  That's not, yeah.
[9620.52 --> 9625.18]  I didn't need that for the game to feel better to me, but whatever.
[9625.52 --> 9629.90]  Um, and a prime jumped in and said, um, they're saying they're going to do a different car
[9629.90 --> 9630.66]  for robot taxi.
[9630.86 --> 9634.48]  I think it's part of the whole model three isn't appreciating car shtick so they can
[9634.48 --> 9635.76]  resell and refurb it themselves.
[9635.88 --> 9636.00]  Yeah.
[9636.00 --> 9638.12]  That's, that's probably, that's probably more accurate.
[9638.22 --> 9638.92]  I don't know.
[9638.98 --> 9640.14]  I don't care anymore.
[9640.40 --> 9642.34]  I, I, I no longer, that's what I'm going to say.
[9642.38 --> 9647.14]  I'm going to say, look, I, I, that's just, well, I'm just going to say it.
[9647.16 --> 9647.42]  Okay.
[9647.50 --> 9647.72]  Yep.
[9647.72 --> 9648.30]  That's what you said.
[9648.36 --> 9648.48]  Okay.
[9648.48 --> 9648.68]  Good.
[9649.68 --> 9651.08]  I don't want to talk about it anymore.
[9652.60 --> 9653.00]  Yeah.
[9653.44 --> 9654.28]  Oh man.
[9654.90 --> 9655.40]  That is a great.
[9655.40 --> 9659.44]  Dayton says if autonomous, if autonomous cars are fast and safe, it's better to just
[9659.44 --> 9661.80]  delete the cars and do autonomous transit.
[9661.80 --> 9672.22]  Not necessarily because if they're also environmentally, like if they're also less environmentally impactful,
[9672.22 --> 9678.84]  then we, we could still enjoy the efficiency of small groups of people going only to exactly
[9678.84 --> 9683.68]  where they need versus, you know, having to get off of one thing that's on a particular
[9683.68 --> 9685.64]  route and then get onto like another thing.
[9685.64 --> 9685.92]  Yeah.
[9685.92 --> 9687.64]  Public transit can be very inefficient.
[9688.36 --> 9689.92]  Linus and I both grew up in the boonies.
[9691.04 --> 9694.66]  Whenever, whenever I hear people mention like public transit is the answer to everything.
[9694.66 --> 9696.16]  I'm like, you didn't grow up in the boonies.
[9696.16 --> 9699.16]  It's just like, it doesn't work for everywhere.
[9700.16 --> 9703.74]  And where we live now is, is much more notably developed.
[9704.58 --> 9707.60]  But like, it's, yeah, I don't know.
[9707.60 --> 9710.32]  It's, it's not always going to work for everybody.
[9710.46 --> 9714.36]  People don't necessarily have the time to, to walk to where a transit thing would be,
[9714.50 --> 9720.38]  wait for it to show up, risk it not showing up on time, et cetera, et cetera.
[9721.22 --> 9728.06]  There's a big discussion around open pilot in float plane chat and looks super cool.
[9728.22 --> 9732.24]  I actually had considered upgrading my Odyssey to one of the ones with the camera so that I
[9732.24 --> 9733.04]  could install it.
[9733.08 --> 9734.04]  I think that's open pilot.
[9734.16 --> 9737.22]  It was one of those like open source autonomous driving things.
[9737.22 --> 9738.22]  I think it's that one.
[9738.56 --> 9743.04]  But it's become so challenging to get like a new car that I just didn't.
[9743.62 --> 9745.98]  So that's where I was at on that one.
[9747.76 --> 9749.14]  Last message from Nye.
[9749.62 --> 9751.34]  This is a great green screen job.
[9751.60 --> 9752.06]  Any tips?
[9753.24 --> 9756.34]  Well, first you're going to want the greenest possible screen.
[9756.46 --> 9756.76]  Okay.
[9757.54 --> 9759.20]  See this one right here?
[9760.30 --> 9760.98]  Hold on.
[9761.48 --> 9762.72]  Got a lot of green in it.
[9762.84 --> 9765.56]  So I could, well, here, I can't, I'm going to break this.
[9767.22 --> 9772.80]  Is this, is this one of the Elgato green screens or is this just like, I do believe.
[9773.00 --> 9773.18]  Yeah.
[9773.34 --> 9773.60]  Okay.
[9775.98 --> 9776.64]  There you go.
[9776.82 --> 9779.42]  See, so that's the very edge of it right there.
[9779.48 --> 9779.90]  So it's good.
[9779.96 --> 9780.48]  It's very green.
[9780.56 --> 9780.80]  Okay.
[9781.18 --> 9781.50]  Second.
[9781.50 --> 9785.90]  You want it to be a screen and you're going to need light.
[9786.70 --> 9786.88]  Okay.
[9786.94 --> 9792.26]  So you can see you got a, if you point the light toward the camera, your green screen is going
[9792.26 --> 9794.82]  to struggle a little, but you point the light at the green screen.
[9794.98 --> 9795.24]  Boom.
[9796.18 --> 9796.42]  God.
[9796.48 --> 9797.52]  Like it's not even there.
[9797.58 --> 9799.18]  You got to illuminate the green.
[9799.52 --> 9799.86]  Invisible.
[9799.86 --> 9805.22]  Uh, second, we're using OBS and I think, uh, I think Dan configured it.
[9805.40 --> 9806.30]  So good work, Dan.
[9807.50 --> 9808.14]  Shout out Dan.
[9809.08 --> 9809.44]  Yeah.
[9809.46 --> 9812.98]  There's, there's little, there's little things you can do to kind of tune it and tweak it.
[9814.10 --> 9816.08]  This actually like worked surprisingly well.
[9816.36 --> 9821.58]  A lot of people, like every time I did something to, to mess with the effect, there was a lot
[9821.58 --> 9824.36]  of people that were really surprised that I'm not just like sitting there.
[9824.36 --> 9829.82]  Cause it's, it's not that noticeable, especially cause we put the, the real fake water bottles.com,
[9829.82 --> 9832.58]  uh, water bottles here to mask.
[9832.70 --> 9837.22]  What was a problem last time where Luke was just like a floating torso above the desk.
[9837.84 --> 9838.28]  Yeah.
[9838.28 --> 9842.80]  And like, I would also point out in regards to, I'm getting to it, Theo, relax.
[9843.16 --> 9848.92]  Um, I would also like to point out that we're not using in the past for remote calls.
[9848.92 --> 9852.56]  Like when we throw the entire quarantine, for example, we use discord.
[9852.56 --> 9857.04]  Uh, and in the past, whenever we had to remote call someone in, in general, we would use
[9857.04 --> 9858.36]  discard, we use Skype.
[9858.54 --> 9860.80]  I can't even remember everything we've used over time.
[9861.44 --> 9865.54]  Um, but we've used a bunch of different stuff and it's always been pretty annoying cause you
[9865.54 --> 9867.66]  have to like screen grab the call window.
[9867.66 --> 9872.02]  And whenever that person hangs up, it'll just like, I mean, you're screen grabbing.
[9872.02 --> 9875.78]  So it'll just show whatever is there, which can sometimes be problematic and et cetera, et cetera.
[9875.78 --> 9881.64]  So we're using, uh, we're using ping.gg, uh, which is a new service that you can check out.
[9881.64 --> 9887.88]  And I mean, this was a fair bit of a stress test because the initial idea was that we were just
[9887.88 --> 9894.84]  going to use this to intro the, the, uh, the new lead of labs, which so far has been delayed
[9894.84 --> 9895.80]  like every single week.
[9895.80 --> 9898.92]  But then we were like, oh, instead of doing this really short segment where we're going to do that,
[9898.92 --> 9902.04]  we're actually going to use it for the entire show to call Linus in.
[9902.04 --> 9903.56]  Uh, and it's worked great the whole time.
[9903.56 --> 9909.80]  It's nice because instead of, like I said, screen grabbing, we just had a browser source and boom, it's there.
[9909.80 --> 9911.80]  So it's been good.
[9911.80 --> 9912.92]  It was stable the whole show.
[9912.92 --> 9913.80]  So that was good.
[9915.80 --> 9916.36]  All right.
[9916.36 --> 9917.80]  I think that's pretty much it.
[9917.80 --> 9920.52]  I think it's time to call it ladies and gentlemen.
[9920.52 --> 9921.32]  Yeah.
[9921.32 --> 9922.92]  Hope you enjoyed the WAN show this week.
[9922.92 --> 9923.80]  We'll see you again next week.
[9923.80 --> 9925.80]  Same bad time, same bad channel.
[9925.80 --> 9926.76]  Bad channel.
[9926.76 --> 9930.68]  Oh, there's four merch messages in queue, but that have not actually shown yet.
[9931.48 --> 9936.76]  Uh, I'm sorry that you missed out on them, but Hey, thanks for buying.
[9936.76 --> 9938.44]  Uh, thanks for buying water bottles guys.
[9939.88 --> 9942.92]  There's a lot of you who did it and that's very nice.
[9942.92 --> 9943.64]  Enjoy your water.
[9946.68 --> 9947.08]  Bye.
[9947.48 --> 9950.68]  I, I actually can't kill the stream from here and I can't roll.
[9950.68 --> 9953.48]  Uh, so like, oh, I can roll the outro.
[9953.48 --> 9953.88]  I think.
[9953.88 --> 9954.76]  Yeah.
[9954.76 --> 9955.32]  Bye.
[9955.80 --> 9956.36]  Bye.
