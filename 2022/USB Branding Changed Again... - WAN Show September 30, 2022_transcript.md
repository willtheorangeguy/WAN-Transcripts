[0.72 --> 4.18]  Welcome to the WAN Show, everyone. We've got a great show lined up for you today.
[4.34 --> 9.58]  Lots of fantastic topics, actually. We have far, far too much to talk about.
[9.78 --> 12.18]  I said fart. Fart too much.
[13.66 --> 18.12]  Rest in peace, Stadia. We hardly knew ye.
[18.24 --> 21.14]  That's right. We'll be discussing the...
[21.14 --> 22.90]  Seems inevitable, wasn't it?
[23.46 --> 25.78]  Downfall of Google Stadia.
[25.78 --> 30.74]  We'll also be talking about Ryzen 7000, hot or not.
[30.96 --> 35.66]  Now that Intel has shown their cards, we are much better equipped to talk about
[35.66 --> 41.56]  who we think is going to be taking the lead in this generation of gaming performance.
[41.66 --> 42.54]  What else we got today?
[42.66 --> 46.04]  We're going to be talking about the extremely exciting things that I did yesterday.
[47.94 --> 49.04]  Whatever that is.
[49.30 --> 51.46]  And we're going to be talking about some other stuff.
[52.30 --> 53.18]  Really, Luke?
[53.44 --> 54.36]  USB branding?
[54.36 --> 57.18]  Yeah, USB branding. They're changing it again.
[57.42 --> 61.58]  USB to kill off super speed and USB 4 branding.
[61.80 --> 61.96]  What?
[62.28 --> 62.96]  What's happening?
[63.00 --> 64.12]  What is going on?
[64.24 --> 66.04]  If anything, those were your better ones.
[66.36 --> 67.30]  What are you doing?
[68.38 --> 69.86]  I'm rolling the intro. What?
[70.12 --> 71.84]  Oh. Stop it.
[72.36 --> 72.60]  Oh.
[72.60 --> 72.68]  Oh.
[72.68 --> 72.86]  Oh.
[72.86 --> 72.92]  Oh.
[72.92 --> 72.98]  Oh.
[72.98 --> 73.04]  Oh.
[73.04 --> 73.14]  Oh.
[73.14 --> 73.24]  Oh.
[73.24 --> 73.32]  Oh.
[73.32 --> 73.42]  Oh.
[73.42 --> 73.48]  Oh.
[73.48 --> 73.92]  Oh.
[73.92 --> 73.98]  Oh.
[73.98 --> 74.48]  Oh.
[74.48 --> 74.54]  Oh.
[74.54 --> 74.92]  Oh.
[74.92 --> 74.98]  Oh.
[74.98 --> 75.04]  Oh.
[75.04 --> 76.98]  Oh.
[76.98 --> 77.04]  Oh.
[77.04 --> 78.98]  Oh.
[78.98 --> 79.04]  Oh.
[79.04 --> 79.98]  Oh.
[79.98 --> 80.98]  Oh.
[80.98 --> 81.04]  Oh.
[81.04 --> 81.98]  Oh.
[81.98 --> 82.98]  Oh.
[82.98 --> 83.04]  Oh.
[83.04 --> 83.98]  Oh.
[83.98 --> 84.04]  Oh.
[84.04 --> 84.34]  Oh.
[84.36 --> 89.16]  Oh.
[93.36 --> 93.50]  Oh.
[93.50 --> 94.54]  Oh.
[94.54 --> 100.70]  45 drives and secret lab all right why don't we jump right into the headline topic today
[100.70 --> 111.46]  which is that the usb implementers forum is changing the branding again i just want to
[111.46 --> 118.32]  i just want to give a shout out to gd felt over on the forum long time member first time poster
[118.32 --> 121.84]  i actually don't know if you're a long time member first post on the forum
[121.84 --> 128.86]  in 2019 okay so why don't we go through some of the some of what has led up to this moment
[128.86 --> 135.10]  in 2019 not a long time member the usb if implemented the following name changes
[135.10 --> 142.46]  they took usb 3.0 which was pretty self-explanatory you get it it's the first one it's usb 3 you had
[142.46 --> 150.32]  your usb 1 and 1.1 okay that was the slow one then you had your usb 2 okay that was the fast one then
[150.32 --> 159.72]  you had your usb 3 that was the faster one okay easy good okay they renamed usb 3.0 which was good
[159.72 --> 172.26]  to usb 3.1 gen 1 which is bad okay they renamed usb 3.1 which was i don't even remember now was that
[172.26 --> 176.30]  the one that was like 10 gigabit i don't remember what the differentiator i don't remember anymore
[176.30 --> 186.26]  but that got renamed to usb 3.1 gen 2 then later it was actually renamed to 3.2 gen 2
[186.26 --> 193.06]  and then usb 3.2 got renamed to usb 3.2 gen 2 by 2
[193.06 --> 200.44]  the group sought to make things easier for consumers by recommending to vendors that they
[200.44 --> 207.64]  label products not by their specification name but by super speed usb followed by the max speed
[207.64 --> 218.88]  which in my opinion pretty okay not bad yeah okay so for example with that guidance usb 3.2 gen 2 by 2
[218.88 --> 228.28]  would become super speed usb 20 gigabit per second okay so now the usb if is recommending that vendors
[228.28 --> 235.48]  just drop the super speed so usb 3.2 gen 2 by 2 super speed usb 20 gigabit per second
[235.48 --> 244.70]  is now usb 20 gigabit per second i like it that's actually fine i didn't actually know the conclusion
[244.70 --> 248.20]  of this when we got into it you know what's really great about it the best thing about it
[248.20 --> 254.54]  is that that's what i've been doing for years yeah instead of said no one says super speed usb
[254.54 --> 259.02]  instead of trying to do any of this like you'll you guys watch me watch me and i don't always do
[259.02 --> 262.54]  it because it wasn't a formal naming convention it was just something that i did because it was the
[262.54 --> 267.66]  only thing that could possibly make sense of this for me is i'll be holding up a laptop or i'll be
[267.66 --> 272.86]  looking at the back eye of a motherboard and i'll be like yeah it's got it's got four usb 10 gigabit
[272.86 --> 279.26]  ports because that's the only thing anyone cared about yeah it's how fast does it go yeah i don't care
[279.26 --> 286.30]  how by how many things of what super speed whatever gen thing it is i did like the logo setups that they
[286.30 --> 292.14]  had for it that's a weird curveball that i'll throw out there okay i didn't mind that so they have good
[292.14 --> 298.54]  graphic designers and bad product naming people well no like here i'm trying to find one i found an
[298.54 --> 306.06]  article from how to geek that might have it if i can find it no it showed on google images i hate how
[306.06 --> 315.90]  google images works now uh can i use this i still get angry when i right click a google search result
[315.90 --> 323.66]  and go to paste it somewhere and it's like 14 miles long okay okay my generation remembers when you used
[323.66 --> 328.54]  to right click it and it didn't have any of that tracking crap yeah it was just the actual link yeah i
[328.54 --> 335.66]  need an extension or something that fixes that i need that hold on boom there the port and cable logo i
[335.66 --> 339.74]  liked that is that going to change this isn't even the one that i thought it was which one's
[339.74 --> 344.46]  which one darn it which one do you like i brought us to the wrong thing oh okay wide cam where it
[344.46 --> 350.54]  where it shows the ss i got you where it shows the ss thing and then it shows the cable it has the
[350.54 --> 355.10]  speed under it i thought that was good okay it's very straightforward i'm like okay that's a usb plug
[355.10 --> 359.98]  this is speed that it's at i'm done we're good all right so i hope they keep the logo simple now
[359.98 --> 366.46]  where things are going to get a little bit complicated here is that usb has gotten a lot
[366.46 --> 375.90]  more well complicated so we're dropping super speed but what we don't know yet is how things like usb
[375.90 --> 381.90]  4 play into all of this now that we're dropping the usb 4 branding because usb 4
[381.90 --> 393.42]  is not really just a new generation of usb it also has the ability to carry a pci express signal
[393.98 --> 400.46]  which is super different that's how you can connect things like uh external graphics cards
[400.46 --> 404.14]  over a usb type c cable so we're going to have to get a little bit further into this
[404.70 --> 408.94]  said that the logos have come out and they're similar and they're good okay another thing that
[408.94 --> 415.82]  we're not really addressing here is usb gets used for more than just connecting your your digital
[415.82 --> 423.82]  camera yeah to your computer these days we charge our devices sometimes at extremely extremely high
[423.82 --> 431.74]  power like charging rates uh with these usb cables and so it's a lot more than just what data rates a
[431.74 --> 438.54]  cable can handle it's also what gauge the wires inside it are that determines how much power that cable can
[438.54 --> 447.10]  actually carry so let's go let's go on here usb 4 version 1.0 so that's what we would know as usb 4
[447.10 --> 454.46]  right now usb version 2 so i guess that would be usb 2 usb 3.2 super speed plus enhanced super speed
[454.46 --> 460.54]  and super speed with a plus sign instead of a word plus are defined in the usb specifications however
[460.54 --> 466.22]  these terms are not intended to be used in product names messaging packaging or any other consumer
[466.22 --> 473.10]  facing content this is from source 2 this is from ars technica um this was updated in september they
[473.10 --> 479.50]  still recommend that vendors label usb 2 as high speed usb with no performance indicator
[482.22 --> 487.66]  okay most products using usb 2 spec are peripherals like keyboards and printers so they don't think
[487.66 --> 491.66]  consumers will mistake the tech for being faster than say usb 5 gigabit per second
[491.66 --> 500.06]  okay the usb if also feared people confusing usb 480 megabit per second as being faster than usb 5
[500.06 --> 503.82]  gigabit per second due to the larger number that's fair enough so why don't we just call it usb 2
[503.82 --> 509.50]  because that's what we've been calling it since like 2003 or whatever um that would be fine but okay
[509.50 --> 515.66]  fine sure for usb-c cables they now recommend packaging and logos that show both maximum data
[515.66 --> 520.38]  transfer rate and power delivery that's excellent that's actually really good i'm down with that but
[521.18 --> 526.62]  the usb ifs guidelines do not specify other capabilities like intel thunderbolt support
[526.62 --> 533.02]  whether a cable is active or passive or if it allows pcie tunneling which is in my opinion the most
[533.02 --> 543.10]  differentiating thing about usb 4 according to usb if president and coo consumer study groups showed
[543.10 --> 548.78]  that most consumers only care about the highest data performance level a product can achieve or the
[548.78 --> 558.62]  highest power level but that is stupid no offense because pci express tunneling is something that
[558.62 --> 565.58]  the average consumer wouldn't understand to tell you that they care about that's your entire job is
[565.58 --> 571.42]  creating branding and messaging that helps people understand the value of it and just because you've
[571.42 --> 578.62]  been doing this speed-based marketing and branding for so long and people understand it well and tell
[578.62 --> 583.98]  you that they want to know about it doesn't mean that there aren't other important aspects of the
[583.98 --> 587.66]  specification that must be communicated
[590.94 --> 596.14]  yeah dumb yep and the usb if never talked to us again
[597.74 --> 601.66]  man have they talked to you at all i don't know yeah i don't know but like
[602.86 --> 607.58]  ah man yvonne would tell me to be a lot nicer i'm sorry i didn't i didn't mean to say it's dumb and
[607.58 --> 612.22]  i didn't mean to say that you were an idiot and that you're bad at your job or i don't know did i
[612.22 --> 618.94]  say that you didn't know well no i don't think you said any of that before the point is the point is
[619.50 --> 626.06]  that i disagree respectfully and i'm sure that you're really good at the other things that you
[626.06 --> 634.62]  do as president and coo of usb if and i'd love to work together sometime to make better branding or
[634.62 --> 640.06]  i don't know maybe they could maybe they could show us cool usb would you say that this is a move
[640.06 --> 644.30]  in the right direction oh absolutely there we go we can at least give them a win it's a step in the
[644.30 --> 648.86]  right direction well i already talked about that before i know but you're you're doing conclusionary
[648.86 --> 654.14]  statements you know and there there is a lot of good here i would say i don't think it's completely
[654.14 --> 658.78]  there but this is a lot better than it was and this is gonna be a lot more straightforward
[658.78 --> 663.50]  for consumers which is good because that's kind of the point yeah um i mean i had already talked
[663.50 --> 668.38]  about this we've been working on cables in the background for a little while and i had already
[668.38 --> 673.42]  said yeah we're just going to completely ignore whatever the usb if says we're just going to put
[673.42 --> 677.10]  the maximum data rate that can handle and the maximum power it can handle so they essentially
[677.10 --> 681.26]  they've just they're doing that done good which is great that's really good yeah that's a step in
[681.26 --> 688.94]  the right direction good job yeah i think that's about it we're also going to put uh whether it supports
[688.94 --> 695.34]  pc i e tunneling though because that's of course really important yeah because you're we're trying
[695.34 --> 703.18]  to make usb cables less confusing that's that's the point right but you you did good you did you did
[703.18 --> 708.46]  pretty good pretty good all right what do you want to talk about next we talk stadia uh sure or do you
[708.46 --> 713.34]  want to talk about your shoes uh because i think the people are waiting for an update on your shoes i feel
[713.34 --> 719.74]  like that's more you can't find shoes no i did okay well normally can't find shoes yeah he's had
[719.74 --> 724.78]  the same shoes for so many years i thought he was just cheap it turns out he's cheap and he has a hard
[724.78 --> 730.46]  time finding those same shoes that he really likes and luke finally found shoes that make him happy we're
[730.46 --> 734.06]  talking we're talking about the shoes i want to hear about your shoes we can open them because i
[734.06 --> 738.70]  haven't seen them yeah let's luke he's doing a shoe unboxing ladies and gentlemen hey dan do you mind
[738.70 --> 743.18]  jumping on that camera uh while you guys are getting set up for this if you want to send a message in
[743.18 --> 748.62]  to the show the right way to do it is merch messages i think we probably have some new stuff
[748.62 --> 755.42]  from the store yes short circuit sweatpants are now available mystery lanyards are now available if
[755.42 --> 762.94]  you don't care what color lanyard you get you can save 50 just 4.99 for an ltt lanyard we also have
[762.94 --> 767.98]  less than 10 000 of the black shaft screwdrivers left for backorder once they're gone they're gone we have
[767.98 --> 774.22]  no plan to offer them in the future uh so there's the update on ltd store actually i guess i'll show
[774.22 --> 779.26]  you the short circuit i guess i'll show you the short circuit sweatpants real quick here so these
[779.26 --> 785.26]  are some suggestions for things you guys can check out oh that's enough so it matches the short circuit
[785.26 --> 791.74]  hoodie it's pretty subtle honestly it just has like zipper accents okay yeah they go perfectly with the
[791.74 --> 798.22]  short circuit hoodie yeah uh they're available in a bunch of different sizes bunch of different lengths
[799.02 --> 805.58]  uh got nice cool like lining that matches good stuff like that so guys you can you can check those
[805.58 --> 811.58]  out ltd store uh we just find this is a better way of handling things than doing it with super chats
[811.58 --> 816.30]  or twitch things or whatever else because this way if we don't get to your message then you still get
[816.30 --> 821.10]  your order in the mail which is pretty sick all right i'm switching to the luke cam luke this is it
[821.10 --> 830.54]  the oh no that wasn't it the oh oh uh uh uh i gotta do this hey okay my shoes are in a bag you and so
[830.54 --> 835.66]  how do you know these are good i don't exactly technically what you yeah you just you told me
[835.66 --> 840.86]  before the show that these were good they should be theoretically i haven't opened them well i don't
[840.86 --> 846.14]  know i thought they're the same ones right now they are schrodinger's shoes not my shoes
[846.14 --> 851.82]  so they could be dead sure they could be alive i mean a dead shoe would that be like holes in the
[851.82 --> 858.54]  bottom so the shoes could be alive yeah um and by observing them they could become dead yeah okay
[858.54 --> 865.50]  well i now i really want to know what's in there hopefully shoes uh so yeah the idea is i i bought
[865.50 --> 869.34]  this one pair of shoes they worked great for me and i never wanted to get rid of them because i'd go try
[869.34 --> 873.66]  on other shoes and i would dislike them all the time i hate padding around the heel i don't roll my
[873.66 --> 879.50]  ankles i've like never rolled an ankle i don't need an ankle support i find it very annoying
[879.50 --> 885.74]  actually i really hate it so i love not having fat ankles he has padding i have it might be true
[885.74 --> 890.78]  his ankles have rolls so he can never roll them that would be so interesting i don't know how that
[890.78 --> 897.74]  would even work um i have very tall feet i have very wide feet a lot of like running and fitness shoes
[897.74 --> 902.62]  don't fit me very well because of that yeah these ones do like there's a lot of reasons why i like
[902.62 --> 909.90]  these shoes um but through years and years and years of just trashing them like i used to box in them
[909.90 --> 915.66]  they've traveled with me everywhere they've climbed ridiculous things they've done tons of stuff i threw
[915.66 --> 921.58]  them in the in the wash once and then transferred them to the dryer and the the toe got stuck in part of
[921.58 --> 929.98]  the dryer and it like heat molded it into a curve and i just had to like wear that out over years
[929.98 --> 935.66]  like they are they are old and rough and they are at the end of their life and mindman in twitch chat
[935.66 --> 940.62]  says this camera is very sharp so i'll take that as a compliment for dan's uh focus control over there
[940.62 --> 947.18]  yeah good job good job dan it's actually a c200 our wenshow cameras are so overkill so these are
[947.18 --> 954.38]  theoretically the same shoes the same shoes in theoretically very good condition in actually
[954.38 --> 959.90]  my size which is the hard part right i don't have like absolutely ridiculously gigantic feet but i have
[959.90 --> 968.62]  size 12s yeah which can be a little annoying to find sometimes um so this is this is hopefully my new
[968.62 --> 976.70]  shoes they look like they're in pretty good condition wow okay are those the same yeah
[977.50 --> 982.62]  okay and these are like are these are these old or are these like a re a re-manufacture
[982.62 --> 989.50]  theoretically just old actually legit shoes i mean i i gotta say they look like
[990.46 --> 997.02]  i i mean i guess like shoe enthusiasts are a big thing these days not for these so keeping shoes in
[997.02 --> 1002.38]  good condition i guess is a thing they're they're a little worn even though like insole is in pretty
[1002.38 --> 1006.78]  good yeah like the toe the toe's a little i don't think these have been able to be
[1006.78 --> 1011.42]  sold at a store for like seven years so keep that in mind so they've been they've been used but
[1011.42 --> 1020.06]  they've clearly been not you know do they smell no not bad no they don't smell like new shoes no but
[1020.06 --> 1025.26]  they don't smell like disgusting ancient gross disgusting shoes all right so congratulations
[1025.26 --> 1030.54]  luke yeah i feel good for you thanks dan well not really new shoes but yeah yeah so that's cool
[1030.54 --> 1036.70]  that's the whole shoe story hope that was interesting i was planning to leave that until like
[1036.70 --> 1042.30]  way later in the show if we talked about it at all not like the second topic no i was excited to talk
[1042.30 --> 1048.78]  about it uh what's more interesting if we want to stay off topic is what i did last night but i feel
[1048.78 --> 1053.90]  like we should talk about stadia yeah let's talk about stadia okay you keep bringing this up i didn't
[1053.90 --> 1058.94]  i didn't know what you did last night because no one did stadia last night because it sucks got them
[1058.94 --> 1064.78]  well okay now hold on a second actually you know why it sucks talk about that not necessarily because
[1064.78 --> 1071.42]  the service oh i see but because google sucks uh stadia sucks because google sucks okay it sucks because no
[1071.42 --> 1076.78]  one believed in it because everyone thought it would be canceled because of course it was going to be
[1076.78 --> 1082.14]  canceled because it's google so no one wants to like invest in this ecosystem that they know is
[1082.14 --> 1089.10]  going to be trashed yes trashed he's trashed trashed thrown in the garbage yeah because the the the
[1089.10 --> 1094.22]  service itself as far as my understanding goes was actually like really good yes actually quite
[1094.22 --> 1101.18]  impressive image quality from the last um so uh gary from the lab looked at image quality for stadia
[1101.18 --> 1106.14]  versus is it geforce now i can never remember what it's called anymore but nvidia's service yeah
[1106.14 --> 1112.22]  um and the stadia image quality was better i've seen quite a few well it's technologically like
[1112.22 --> 1117.74]  quite good as far as my understanding considering uh how many people were using stadia i've seen quite
[1117.74 --> 1123.58]  a few tweets from people saying i actually loved stadia the people that i know that actually used it
[1123.58 --> 1130.22]  thought it was pretty good yep um yeah but it's officially dead and with very little no surprise it's
[1130.22 --> 1139.10]  going offline january i'm not either 2023 um the one of the worst parts is have you seen have you
[1139.10 --> 1145.02]  seen the email they sent out internally no i haven't actually oh i heard about it but my goodness the email
[1145.02 --> 1152.46]  is brutal hold on let me see if i can find this stadia i think i have it in my in my in my thing here
[1153.18 --> 1159.98]  uh oh balls no i don't see it but it's it's bad basically they just sent out an email that was like
[1160.62 --> 1167.74]  yeah we have an all hands meeting uh tomorrow and you should probably prioritize being there
[1168.54 --> 1176.46]  thanks uh you know about the future of development and by the way we're shutting it down see you later
[1176.46 --> 1180.54]  now they're not see you later i think these people are being assigned to other things but like
[1180.54 --> 1185.82]  how demoralizing is this never mind for part oh man we got to talk about the impact on partners
[1185.82 --> 1197.42]  but how demoralizing is this for uh for a programmer for uh an engineer for anyone to to put i mean they
[1197.42 --> 1204.70]  they didn't they they started this like almost three years ago 2019 2019 okay i've got that i've got the
[1204.70 --> 1209.98]  email you've got it okay it's got a name on it it's got a name on it oh i mean they shared it so i guess
[1209.98 --> 1215.42]  yeah sure go ahead and read it read it uh confidential internal only please do not forward
[1215.42 --> 1221.90]  i mean you saw how well that went um whoever shared this your google email is in it so whoops
[1221.90 --> 1227.74]  probably should have not done that uh but it says hi everyone we'll be having a stadia team meeting today
[1228.54 --> 1234.78]  not tomorrow oh sorry i got that detail wrong um this was sent out at 7 0 8 a.m we'll be having a
[1234.78 --> 1242.38]  stadia team meeting today uh september 29th at 8 30 a.m so okay so people had less than an hour and a
[1242.38 --> 1248.62]  half to to get ready uh to share some important updates with everyone apologies for the short notice
[1248.62 --> 1254.62]  yeah uh we would appreciate it if you could can please prioritize attending this meeting or check
[1254.62 --> 1259.18]  in with your manager afterwards if you can't make it details have been added to your calendars this will
[1259.18 --> 1264.62]  be a virtual only meeting so please feel free to join from wherever you're working today best phil
[1265.18 --> 1272.06]  that's it that's it that's it so they didn't say they're closing the company or whatever but i guess
[1272.06 --> 1275.10]  they probably did uh an hour and 22 minutes later
[1278.06 --> 1286.54]  that is absolutely brutal and as far as i can tell literally everyone got absolutely blindsided by this
[1287.18 --> 1293.10]  uh developers heard about it from the news i know a lot of developers that heard about this through
[1293.10 --> 1297.18]  the news they were actively working on actively developing things for stadia and it just got
[1297.18 --> 1306.70]  canceled looking at how google is planning to support the users i'm hoping they do a similar thing for the devs and make sure that they
[1306.70 --> 1312.22]  they don't get just wrecked uh because it looks like they're doing full refunds for like basically
[1312.22 --> 1317.42]  everything i don't know if that's in the notes here but they're doing refunds on hardware they're doing
[1317.42 --> 1321.58]  refunds on purchases as far as i know the only thing they're not doing a full refund on is the subscription
[1323.26 --> 1326.86]  but like things you bought through the play store whatever they're giving you full refunds for it
[1326.86 --> 1333.34]  do you think some people knew i still have my tab open from the logitech cloud gaming device from last
[1333.34 --> 1342.86]  week and i've i remember it being sort of notable to me that the only cloud services they mentioned
[1342.86 --> 1350.46]  were xbox game pass and geforce now and stadia would have seemed like an obvious one to support i mean
[1350.46 --> 1356.38]  i mean unless you were smart and realized that google would probably just cancel it at some point
[1357.82 --> 1363.82]  um oh wow apparently someone in flow plane chat said they they started rolling out a new ui update
[1363.82 --> 1371.90]  literally just hours before the announcement like these people were actively moving on this stuff
[1371.90 --> 1377.90]  that is so internal and external team because there's no way that a project like that was just
[1377.90 --> 1383.98]  canceled as it wasn't a snap decision like it's absolutely something where
[1385.18 --> 1390.62]  i get it if you don't ultimately end up canceling it you don't want people to just be sitting
[1390.62 --> 1397.58]  you know unsure whether they're going to have a project to work on tomorrow but is this really more humane
[1399.58 --> 1405.50]  if google rolled out something on the scale of something like gmail i don't know what it would be
[1405.50 --> 1410.22]  i can't give you an exact tool but on the scale of something like gmail where it's very fundamental
[1411.18 --> 1417.50]  very important would you even try it would you migrate okay maybe you try it would you seriously
[1417.50 --> 1422.46]  try it to the point where you like migrate to it uh if you weren't doing it for a review reason
[1422.46 --> 1426.30]  because at this point how do you trust them for anything any service that they spin up they just kill
[1426.30 --> 1435.34]  i'm trying to think if i use any google service that was started up in the last 10 years that's what
[1435.34 --> 1447.74]  i'm getting at i use android i use gmail i hardly touch any part of g suite that isn't gmail google docs
[1447.74 --> 1455.34]  google sheets drive like i do not i i do not use things like keep or reminders reminders they just
[1455.34 --> 1461.90]  like messed with again like i don't i do not use uh like i use my google calendar but i use a third
[1461.90 --> 1470.14]  party app because i just i don't i don't want to use their stuff um not like a data privacy thing but
[1470.14 --> 1474.54]  just like because i don't want i don't like things changing i use this app called business calendar
[1474.54 --> 1477.74]  it's really gonna ask you because i actually didn't know you did that oh yeah business calendar
[1477.74 --> 1483.66]  is sick especially on the fold man like check this out boom oh wow it's actually very readable
[1483.66 --> 1490.14]  yeah and so you can it just like pop stuff out like this like my calendar app is like sick it's a paid
[1490.14 --> 1495.26]  app like i i paid like five or ten bucks for it or whatever but it's so worth it like this is my
[1495.26 --> 1501.34]  calendar it's like dense information density is what i care about and the google calendar is there's no
[1501.34 --> 1505.10]  way they have enough resolution i'm not worried uh also there's nothing like particularly scary
[1505.10 --> 1515.98]  there um like the the google calendar is just it's super super sparse um so i'm trying to think
[1516.70 --> 1524.86]  like i use okay i use android tv but that's android i don't need i don't even i don't even know like i
[1524.86 --> 1530.78]  don't touch i don't touch meat i don't touch i use meat i use meat a lot actually but meat is very
[1530.78 --> 1536.38]  replaceable for me to be fair that's the only reason why i use it and i i actually another
[1536.38 --> 1540.94]  calendar thing that i like uh a feature that i actually don't understand at all why google
[1540.94 --> 1547.26]  calendar doesn't have but is uh external because i believe there's some internal tools for doing this
[1547.26 --> 1552.22]  but external people being able to book meetings on your calendar maybe someone's going to school me
[1552.22 --> 1556.46]  and there's some way to do this but i don't think so no you can't do it anymore yeah okay so i use
[1556.46 --> 1562.06]  calendly yeah you used to be able to send calendar invites by email and it would just like go right
[1562.06 --> 1565.34]  onto your calendar or something like that like there was a way better way to do it i forget the
[1565.34 --> 1570.38]  exact details it's one of those things like yeah remember when like we were talking about before
[1570.38 --> 1575.90]  right clicking copy link in a in a google search was just the url more simple yeah there was a simpler
[1575.90 --> 1582.38]  way to to book meetings um like the integration between google calendar and gmail was better
[1582.38 --> 1587.66]  maybe you guys can maybe you guys can remind me but but either way i use that calendly thing
[1588.30 --> 1592.46]  and i just find it very easy to set up like google meetings and stuff through all of that so i just
[1592.46 --> 1597.50]  use google meet night pause asks is that not a thing in outlook yeah but like who uses
[1599.10 --> 1600.62]  dance face dance face
[1600.62 --> 1610.22]  what year is it yikes what year is it yikes
[1613.50 --> 1616.14]  uh someone just dropped outlook on us
[1616.14 --> 1623.58]  i mean okay if we're gonna criticize google for killing things
[1624.22 --> 1629.98]  at least staying power okay at least outlook is still around yeah what about lotus notes
[1629.98 --> 1631.34]  you guys use lotus notes
[1634.94 --> 1642.86]  oh man word perfect almost everyone uses outlook whoa that's not true dude not even a little it's not
[1642.86 --> 1649.02]  true not even a little bit all universities use outlook yeah like government-ran institutions
[1649.02 --> 1655.02]  microsoft has a lot of fingers in those um but outside of that i don't know i don't know about that
[1655.02 --> 1663.74]  oh man that's great um yeah yes a lot of businesses do use it yes yes yes yes yes yes
[1663.74 --> 1670.46]  yes just chill you guys chill um i cannot saying outlook is better than gmail to be fair i have not
[1670.46 --> 1677.90]  used outlook in a long time last time i used it it was embarrassingly bad okay but it's been a long
[1677.90 --> 1683.82]  time i will say okay all right should we do a poll i'm gonna do a poll you can yeah yeah yeah do a poll
[1683.82 --> 1691.02]  do a poll uh dan can you think of any gmail service that was started in the last 10 years that you use
[1691.02 --> 1696.70]  you know duo any like like what do what do they even do guys i i want to hear from you guys too
[1696.70 --> 1704.14]  hit me up floatplane chat yeah i can't think of anything like docs and sheets mostly that's it
[1704.78 --> 1710.94]  i mean i guess i guess most of the google services that we use we uh might not realize we're using
[1710.94 --> 1718.86]  new ad serving technologies and whatnot wow this poll is very surprising so far i asked is outlook
[1718.86 --> 1726.14]  better than gmail yeah and maybe i influenced this poll by making it so the no answer is saying that
[1726.14 --> 1734.06]  gmail is better but a lot of people are saying that like the majority of people are saying that
[1734.06 --> 1740.70]  outlook is better than gmail yeah right here float plane poll wow wow okay people are talking about
[1740.70 --> 1747.02]  like google cloud on desktop good outlook on phone bad someone said what the devil is what the devil is
[1747.02 --> 1753.42]  google fi oh that's their like phone thing okay yeah it's not available even in canada like
[1753.98 --> 1758.30]  they didn't even never mind canceling it they didn't even manage to completely roll it out
[1758.30 --> 1764.14]  yeah rip google play music 100 it was so much better than youtube music and i promise you they know it
[1765.74 --> 1769.82]  uh is google fiber still a thing i don't think so i thought they canned that
[1769.82 --> 1779.58]  google google chat google chat google chat is just hangouts like it google glass i know i asked what
[1779.58 --> 1786.94]  you still use from the last 10 years no that yeah yet another thing they abandoned way to not prove the
[1786.94 --> 1798.78]  point oh man yeah rip inbox yeah exactly yep yeah g pay no i don't use that google pay that's just
[1798.78 --> 1804.22]  part of your phone you probably if you use tap i think you use that no samsung has their own oh
[1804.22 --> 1809.10]  have samsung phone and i don't i didn't even set it up because like i set it up once and then there
[1809.10 --> 1812.94]  were like two different ones on my phone for some reason maybe one of them was the google one and one
[1812.94 --> 1818.70]  of them was the samsung one and i like got confused i was stuck without a credit card at a gas station
[1818.70 --> 1823.42]  for some reason long story i didn't i lost my wallet and i had just dropped yvonne off on a ferry so i
[1823.42 --> 1828.94]  like had no way to pay for fuel um and so i had yvonne give me her credit card information so that i
[1828.94 --> 1834.70]  could enter it into my thing and then it went into like the wrong one and then every time i like swipe
[1834.70 --> 1838.06]  up the thing it's like the other one and i'm just like you know it really doesn't take that long to
[1838.06 --> 1843.50]  take my wallet out of my pocket so i don't care it just makes no difference to me whatsoever if i pull
[1843.50 --> 1849.02]  my phone out of my left pocket or my wallet out of my right pocket to tap to pay i just i can't
[1849.02 --> 1854.78]  someone said ways what yeah but they just bought that bought and when did they even buy it yeah
[1858.54 --> 1867.42]  yeah all right google buys ways yeah i do use youtube music 13 that's like right on the line okay yeah
[1868.86 --> 1875.66]  man this is an interesting conversation because it you know you kind of go yeah google they're like a
[1875.66 --> 1883.98]  multi-billion dollar company uh what they can make good things and again stadia was good well you use
[1883.98 --> 1890.78]  a pixel uh begrudgingly well but you do technically i probably won't and the pixel program is within the
[1890.78 --> 1898.14]  last 10 years like me me me but you use it yeah but look at the quality level of pixels i mean i don't
[1898.14 --> 1902.86]  i can't speak to that i've never i've never daily driven a pixel other than just to review it i just
[1902.86 --> 1909.66]  they've never pulled me in google fiber is back apparently says float plane chat killed by google.com
[1909.66 --> 1914.46]  what is this i've seen this before i've seen this i remember this there's a handful of people in the
[1914.46 --> 1922.70]  float plane chat posting this 274 different things yeah uh it's the end of the functionality of google
[1922.70 --> 1931.10]  assistant by allowing august 2023 june 2023 march 2023 january 2023 all stated for death
[1931.10 --> 1941.42]  youtube originals december 2022 google hangouts oh my goodness what even is google my business app
[1942.46 --> 1945.66]  android auto for phone screens yeah that was kind of annoying that that went away
[1947.18 --> 1957.74]  okay all right what is cameos on google's wait they had a cameo clone shut up i had no idea
[1957.74 --> 1965.42]  okay i've never even what killed eight months ago cameos on google allowed celebrities and other
[1965.42 --> 1971.42]  public flakers to record video responses to the most common questions asked about them which will be
[1971.42 --> 1981.74]  shown to users in google search results fit star yoga this went on for seven years it created a yoga
[1981.74 --> 1990.86]  yoga sessions what poly to distribute 3d objects what am i even looking at here
[1993.50 --> 1999.34]  google cardboard yeah because that was gonna work i can't believe that lasted for six years
[2001.26 --> 2004.78]  tilt brush oh i didn't even know tilt brush was dead that sucks
[2004.78 --> 2010.22]  tilt brush was really cool a couple times and then i kind of got over it that's probably why it
[2010.22 --> 2015.42]  got canceled yeah but i know that there was like artists that 100 focused on tilt brush
[2016.38 --> 2020.46]  yeah like that was their thing and they made really cool stuff cloud print is one of those things that
[2020.46 --> 2025.34]  i always thought like theoretically sounded kind of cool but i never used once apparently it was
[2025.34 --> 2027.42]  10 years old in 2020 when it died
[2027.42 --> 2035.10]  higher higher higher by google um i actually wanted to use this recently yeah because i was
[2035.66 --> 2039.02]  drowning um and yeah i was it was dead
[2040.70 --> 2046.70]  so i was like oh that sucks because i remember us like talking about it on wan forever ago so i was
[2046.70 --> 2052.46]  like oh i'll go find that thing maybe it'll be helpful and then yeah i couldn't to google's credit
[2052.46 --> 2059.02]  most things are being refunded which is the most good guy possible way for them to do this so back
[2059.02 --> 2064.46]  to the stadia topic yeah back to stadia it sounds like they're doing it nicely yeah you don't even
[2064.46 --> 2069.98]  have to return the hardware you just like keep it i would like to see them do something with the
[2069.98 --> 2075.02]  hardware with the hardware i'd like i'd like to see the controllers like still work you know get some
[2075.02 --> 2080.22]  basic drivers i actually have never i've never tried to use a stadia controller because why would i uh for
[2080.22 --> 2086.46]  anything for anything um but i would like for them to still work for something that would be great
[2087.18 --> 2091.58]  apparently it does apparently it does okay the controller works fine as a standard game controller
[2091.58 --> 2096.62]  on both windows and macs apparently there are some limitations but you can use the device as a
[2096.62 --> 2102.70]  wired controller it doesn't work wirelessly uh with a standard bluetooth controller but you can use it
[2102.70 --> 2108.70]  wired so okay i enjoy the idea of not having e-waste i think that's good yep that's good uh this move
[2108.70 --> 2116.22]  of refunding everything uh this this i added uh tells us one of two things either it was costing them
[2116.22 --> 2121.42]  a king's ransom to maintain stadia day to day wouldn't be too surprised considering it was really
[2121.42 --> 2131.90]  good to the point where it's cheaper to just say forget it refund it all make it go away than to just
[2131.90 --> 2138.86]  leave it running indefinitely uh or it tells us that the amount they sold was actually pretty negligible
[2140.78 --> 2145.58]  which i think it might be because i think it's a little column a a little column b yeah that makes
[2145.58 --> 2152.22]  sense i because it's one of those things where again i wouldn't trust uh i don't know if you want
[2152.22 --> 2157.82]  to use the term investment for this but i wouldn't trust investing in a platform like this i'd be sketched
[2157.82 --> 2162.14]  out because it's google right yeah and i feel really bad for all the developers i hope like i
[2162.14 --> 2168.38]  said earlier i really really hope that the developers internal and external are being taken care of at the
[2168.38 --> 2172.22]  same level that it sounds like the customers are being taken care of because it sounds like the
[2172.22 --> 2176.86]  customers are getting a pretty good deal i doubt it i doubt it as well yeah there's just like no way
[2176.86 --> 2181.42]  i'm just saying i hope yeah there's just no way um i do know that they paid
[2181.42 --> 2190.22]  a lot for getting some of the games onto stadia like tens of millions like getting i think they
[2190.22 --> 2198.22]  had like red dead 2 like let's see how much red dead 2 was one sec uh stadia pay for red all of this
[2198.22 --> 2204.14]  comes after ceo sandar pichai pichai i think said he wants to make the company 20 more efficient and cut
[2204.14 --> 2210.30]  costs this is my problem i don't listen to or watch anything i only read so
[2210.30 --> 2216.14]  whenever i whenever i say people's names like on wanshow it's like yeah i've actually never heard
[2216.14 --> 2223.10]  your name spoken so yeah sorry i have that issue with certain words and stuff too yeah um yeah i
[2223.10 --> 2228.38]  don't know the exact amount but there's an article here from gaming bolt that says google spent tens of
[2228.38 --> 2233.98]  millions of dollars for red dead redemption 2 i thought they spent tens of millions of dollars tens of
[2233.98 --> 2239.34]  millions of dollars for games in general i didn't mean i didn't realize it was just red dead 2
[2239.34 --> 2245.18]  that's wild and then they also paid huge sums for other games to get on the platform as well
[2245.98 --> 2253.26]  okay wow um and here's an interesting one any exclusives that were planned for stadia are now
[2253.26 --> 2258.38]  forever lost unless they get bought and or ported to something else and based on what we know about
[2258.38 --> 2263.98]  the game development cycle there could have easily been games that are three to four years into development
[2263.98 --> 2273.98]  right now and could be like quite complete and might never see the light of day i don't know
[2274.54 --> 2279.58]  if i actually don't know of any stadia exclusives but you wouldn't always know about something like
[2279.58 --> 2284.30]  that maybe this is the kind of thing that is going to kind of pop up over the next six to 18 months as
[2284.30 --> 2289.18]  people move on from these positions and they don't fear being sued into oblivion or losing their jobs or
[2289.18 --> 2299.74]  whatever the case may be oh wow i don't like 100 know if there's like this is proof behind this or or
[2299.74 --> 2309.02]  or anything yeah it sounds pretty legit um there's a developer who posted in the r slash game dev subreddit um
[2310.94 --> 2317.02]  they apparently they spent four to five months building a port for stadia and they finished the port like
[2317.02 --> 2322.62]  yesterday um so to read it specifically it says we've been working on our google stadia
[2322.62 --> 2327.74]  game port for a few months the first time we had about 20 plus issues to solve two weeks later stadia
[2327.74 --> 2332.62]  showed us 10 more so it sounds like they were trying to help them which is actually good uh we spent
[2332.62 --> 2337.10]  four to five months fixing everything learning the technology behind it and preparing our game port
[2337.10 --> 2343.66]  on september 29th we had repaired 100 of our faults and were ready to launch stadia today i was hustling and
[2343.66 --> 2348.62]  staying up late in the office to send the last build our build could be the last dispatch build
[2348.62 --> 2355.34]  in stadia's history that's wild we wish that uh we wish to arrive at this platform it's really sad for
[2355.34 --> 2361.02]  stadia employees etc etc google is offering to continue supporting gaming in other areas and will help devs
[2361.02 --> 2366.22]  build and distribute gaming apps on google play and google play games thanks google how long will google
[2366.22 --> 2372.30]  play and google play games exist how long will that help exist i don't know man you guys gotta shake this
[2372.30 --> 2378.94]  reputation of just like throwing things at the wall and then even the ones that stick just letting them
[2378.94 --> 2384.86]  fall off the wall eventually rot on the wall rot on your you got like a rotten spaghetti wall now like
[2384.86 --> 2390.46]  i just don't understand what is going on over there it's it's brutal uh consumer trust
[2392.06 --> 2399.98]  i hope is low at this point to be honest because like wow brutal hope people can migrate game
[2399.98 --> 2404.62]  data i didn't even think about that yeah that sucks oh that's why this is one of the reasons why
[2404.62 --> 2409.34]  i wouldn't want to adopt a platform like that you know that fantasia game that i'm waiting to play
[2409.34 --> 2413.50]  because it's exclusive to apple arcade that's why i'm not that's why i'm not playing it yeah it's not
[2413.50 --> 2418.22]  that i'm not willing to just pay for apple arcade for a month or two while i play this game or like
[2418.22 --> 2423.74]  whatever it's not like i don't have plenty of ios devices fine whatever i'll play a game but i don't want
[2423.74 --> 2428.86]  my save data there i want my save data on something that i think might actually exist at some point
[2428.86 --> 2436.38]  like on a physical device that i own yep and this is this is a huge huge knock for cloud gaming because
[2436.38 --> 2443.10]  i don't think that everyone would go back to a game that they played you know five years ago or something
[2443.10 --> 2449.50]  like that and want their save data um but i have some games sorry to cut you off i have some games where
[2449.50 --> 2454.62]  if there's like a note-taking system or something in the game yeah i'm pretty sure this is the last
[2454.62 --> 2460.06]  time i'm gonna log off for a while i'll like leave my character looking at it and like write myself a
[2460.06 --> 2465.66]  note of like this is what you were doing yeah for sure like if i ever wanted to go back and play dragon
[2465.66 --> 2470.94]  age origins with my character i could it's a save file on my server like i have it right and that's
[2470.94 --> 2479.02]  that's something that's not an option here um we've apparently been offered a stadia dev kit
[2479.02 --> 2484.78]  from a developer who was gonna launch a title on stadia pro next month uh i guess that do you guys
[2484.78 --> 2489.58]  want to see it you guys want to see a stadia dev kit that'd be interesting i yeah i'd be pretty
[2489.58 --> 2493.98]  interested to see it like what what would a stadia dev kit because it's like just just a raspberry
[2493.98 --> 2499.82]  pie yeah is it a little tiny little mini server how many days is that apparently someone has a red
[2499.82 --> 2507.90]  dead redemption 2 game on stadia with 6 000 hours on it wow okay i mean is some of that just leaving
[2507.90 --> 2515.58]  it idling are you the reason they had to shut it down like we've been transmitting this same frame
[2515.58 --> 2522.06]  for four months and fifty days for a lot more than four months we've been transmitting this same frame
[2522.06 --> 2530.94]  for nine months oh no i know there's some people that are like really really hardcore into the like
[2530.94 --> 2540.46]  online gang system in red dead um terrible apparently there's an article about it wow that's so brutal
[2543.90 --> 2552.06]  okay you guys can stop posting about the 6 000 hours thing come on don't spam so much okay let's move on
[2552.06 --> 2557.98]  everyone i feel like we should probably get some sponsors done here and then we'll talk about the
[2558.86 --> 2566.86]  recall on the backpack oh trust me bro we'll take care of it all right all right uh the show is

[2697.26 --> 2701.98]  we have encountered an issue dan you're on the camera again if you don't mind terribly
[2701.98 --> 2710.14]  we have encountered a user reported issue with the carabiner zipper pulls on the ltt store backpack
[2710.14 --> 2718.30]  uh actually i'll start by giving you a sample of one that is not broken uh well here actually i'll
[2718.30 --> 2722.62]  hold it up and i'll show you the first i'll show you the first two then i'll get your impressions
[2722.62 --> 2729.58]  uh for some of the ideas that we have uh this didn't come up during testing oh right i guess i'm
[2729.58 --> 2734.70]  supposed to well not that one gosh darn it there we go okay uh you know what i'm gonna come a little
[2734.70 --> 2741.18]  closer to you dan this didn't come up during testing but what we found is that these custom carabiner
[2743.34 --> 2749.02]  these custom carabiner zipper pulls that are attached to the zippers with these little uh loops here there
[2749.02 --> 2753.90]  you go and they have like a little little carabiner doodad on them you guys can see that pretty well
[2753.90 --> 2760.86]  there yep that's cool uh they were custom designed for our backpack and they only have a very very
[2760.86 --> 2767.74]  skinny little bit of metal here that's really hard to see you think so looking at that i think so
[2767.74 --> 2774.46]  the background is too dark against the well i got my hand here yeah oh here uh well hold on idea
[2775.74 --> 2781.02]  um the laptop maybe oh yeah sure let's go back to the laptop yeah that works okay yeah there we go
[2781.02 --> 2786.46]  uh no no you can you can leave your laptop there i got the uh yeah it's pretty okay yeah there we go
[2786.46 --> 2791.66]  yeah yeah okay so it's got a little a little wobble wobble thing here okay so unfortunately
[2791.66 --> 2797.34]  um and this never came up during our testing because i only ever used these to clip to each other
[2797.34 --> 2803.58]  to keep the zipper from coming open and just to kind of look cool so maybe someone grabbed it funny or
[2803.58 --> 2810.46]  maybe they tried to hang something from it which uh not really intended for but given how much work
[2810.46 --> 2815.42]  we put into the durability of other aspects of the bag we should have caught it yeah there's only a
[2815.42 --> 2822.06]  skinny little skinny chicken piece of metal here uh that holds this in place so while the spring is
[2822.06 --> 2827.26]  fine and it'll last for a long time like this if you put pressure on it from the side
[2829.02 --> 2835.82]  oh you can break it off pretty easily wow yeah yeah that was not a ton of force no so
[2835.82 --> 2845.34]  it to be clear past third party lab tests so our supplier follows iso 9001 for quality uh past
[2845.34 --> 2849.98]  testing within their system and through our third party lab for expected force applied during normal
[2849.98 --> 2857.74]  use however there will always be some part-to-part variants across 160 000 pieces right there's four
[2857.74 --> 2863.50]  per bag um so there's always going to be a failure rate but it's clear that this is a core component
[2863.50 --> 2872.30]  um that um i think just accidentally could have a higher failure rate than we consider to be
[2872.30 --> 2878.22]  acceptable so nope you're not done yet dan i'm so sorry you gotta have a look at some of our new options
[2878.22 --> 2885.90]  okay so what are we doing from here we're actively working on a solid long-term solution which should
[2885.90 --> 2893.02]  include a care package for everyone who bought the backpack that will include three things standard
[2893.02 --> 2897.90]  regular zipper pulls for people who want to opt out of the carabiner entirely and there are reasons
[2897.90 --> 2903.26]  people might want to do this maybe they want to put a padlock on it for even more security or if they
[2903.26 --> 2906.94]  want to check their bag or whatever the case may be that is some feedback that we got so i guess this is
[2906.94 --> 2914.30]  is an opportunity to rectify that um we are also working on it will also include an updated carabiner
[2914.30 --> 2919.10]  pull and we are working on we've actually already prototyped it but they didn't give it to me for the
[2919.10 --> 2927.82]  show today we're working on just a a cheap injection molded tool that will help you uh pry up the little
[2927.82 --> 2933.10]  retainer for the carabiner pull that you have on there and then the other end should allow you to clamp
[2933.10 --> 2939.34]  it back down and replace it with either a standard zipper pull or a replacement carabiner pull and
[2939.34 --> 2943.58]  this is so this is to everyone who has currently received backpacks what are what about the staged
[2943.58 --> 2948.38]  orders i believe actually that's a good question i don't know what will happen with those we'll figure
[2948.38 --> 2954.22]  it out okay um it should be a fairly small operation to swap them so either we'll swap them or we'll
[2954.22 --> 2961.42]  include the swap kit it seems to make more sense for us to swap them but i i'll i don't know the answer
[2961.42 --> 2968.14]  to that so we'll have to figure that out for you uh all right so in the meantime here are some
[2968.14 --> 2975.34]  examples of carabiner pulls that we are looking at that you might end up getting because uh the
[2975.34 --> 2980.46]  original one is not so great anymore uh you know what no i'll show you this one after let's start with
[2980.46 --> 2987.02]  let's start with this one and uh luke do you want to kind of have a look at these and tell us your thoughts
[2987.02 --> 2992.86]  how does this go on a zipper well it would be a lot smaller okay but it would be kind of like that
[2994.14 --> 2998.78]  yeah if you want to hold it just a little more in front of the laptop it's still this is a little
[2998.78 --> 3003.26]  odd you can still get some side to side play but i'm putting quite a bit of force on that and
[3003.26 --> 3008.94]  nothing's really happening yeah well it locks that's the difference oh yeah anything that locks is going
[3008.94 --> 3015.50]  to be a little bit better yeah yeah i i pushed pretty hard in both directions yeah it's ugly and
[3015.50 --> 3020.30]  looks like crap yeah pretty much so it's out uh we've also got this one it's also like dan don't
[3020.30 --> 3025.26]  try to follow us too much we'll we'll we'll we'll follow you we can see you uh this one just has like
[3025.26 --> 3030.38]  a little a little wire majig here that this is similar but only one you know what no i gotta hold
[3030.38 --> 3036.46]  this way closer okay let's let's get this boy let's get this boy close there you go so it's just a
[3036.46 --> 3042.22]  little wire thing uh looks like crap especially compared to the original carabiner pull so i don't
[3042.22 --> 3048.06]  consider this acceptable either both of these are cheap so that's a good thing about them this one
[3048.06 --> 3055.10]  is i'd say the closest to our existing carabiner pull um that have like basically shields on each
[3055.10 --> 3059.82]  side holding it in place is that what's going on it's a lot thicker metal we could also re-engineer
[3059.82 --> 3066.14]  the original one to have like thicker metal sides like this one does but we found a solution that we
[3066.14 --> 3076.86]  like better okay this one i'll let you play with it's really expensive of course i have i have no no
[3076.86 --> 3083.90]  dan i here here here here here i have notoriously expensive taste um it looks beautiful is this how
[3083.90 --> 3089.98]  it will look like final product no it'll be smaller because yeah it's really big so it'll but uh it'll
[3089.98 --> 3095.02]  probably look very similar to this so the camera can't see it at all but it looks like it's like
[3095.02 --> 3103.58]  tempered is that it's titanium oh okay i'm really glad uh at one point in the development process
[3103.58 --> 3107.74]  that doesn't have structural issues hold on we'll talk about it in a sec okay at one point in the
[3107.74 --> 3113.26]  development process for the backpack we considered having carabiner pulls on every single zipper and
[3113.26 --> 3120.06]  we were like ah it's a bit much given the cost of this how much is it's like i'm really glad it's only
[3120.06 --> 3126.70]  four per bag will be okay but how much is this it's really nice uh here i feel like if you bought
[3126.70 --> 3133.02]  that individually it would be like double digit dollars uh no it'll run you oh shoot wrong thing
[3133.02 --> 3139.90]  bloody hell okay there you go so here's what it is guys it's a one piece uh here i'll hold it here
[3140.30 --> 3147.74]  it's a one piece titanium clip here you got to show the bottom and then the hinge yeah the hinge is just
[3147.74 --> 3155.26]  like this um it just bends yeah it just yeah just like it just it just bends it's got like this i
[3155.26 --> 3162.78]  don't know shape to it that kind of yeah okay oh there you go there you go there you go so it's got
[3162.78 --> 3170.06]  these like slits in it but because it's titanium it's super strong and so it bends you gone here and
[3170.06 --> 3176.22]  here and then yeah well side to side it doesn't give any f's because it's titanium right so you
[3176.22 --> 3180.54]  could just i don't know do whatever you want to it so it looks like it moves a fair amount yeah so it
[3180.54 --> 3186.22]  might have a little bit of play but it's not gonna break but it shouldn't break so this is the thanks
[3186.22 --> 3192.14]  dan you're good this is the current front runner solution so everyone who gets a bag will get
[3192.14 --> 3201.50]  something um and it'll either be like a pack of something like this and uh standard poles or a
[3201.50 --> 3206.06]  re-engineered version of the original carabiner pole and standard poles and then we're going to be
[3206.06 --> 3211.82]  working on that tool one thing that i want to warn you guys about now don't feel like oh yeah this
[3211.82 --> 3218.78]  weekend i'm gonna go do this so i'm gonna change my no no no no no no no no no the way that the ykk
[3218.78 --> 3226.54]  zipper is designed is to be permanently installed so yes you can bend it up and you can bend it down
[3227.66 --> 3234.54]  like once otherwise a lot of metal doesn't like doing that yeah it'll fatigue the metal and it will
[3234.54 --> 3242.94]  break so please plus no place no do that and that's not the kind of thing that we're we're going to be
[3242.94 --> 3248.70]  like oh this is your third bag yeah well you know these things happen here's a new one like
[3248.78 --> 3255.18]  don't do that that's that's intentional damage because it will be very clear in the packaging of
[3255.18 --> 3260.38]  the uh replacement kit that you are intended to do it once a bunch of people saying they like the s
[3260.38 --> 3266.30]  carabiner uh that looks like the ugliest one out of all like ass and scaled down to the size of a
[3266.30 --> 3271.18]  zipper pull it's not going to work very well it's it's not a it's not a an appropriate design for what
[3271.18 --> 3279.50]  we're doing yeah um as a former fastener salesman please reach out to a smaller fastener specialist
[3279.50 --> 3287.26]  for more and cheaper options please please um i mean it's not a fastener though it's like it's kind
[3287.26 --> 3291.58]  of just a decorative zipper pull like it's not intended to really do anything that was another
[3291.58 --> 3296.14]  thing i saw a picture of someone talking about this and they were like this isn't built like how it
[3296.14 --> 3301.10]  should be and then they had like a climbing carabiner i was like these are not yeah it's
[3301.10 --> 3306.46]  not for climbing they just link together they're not supposed to be load bearing you know they are
[3306.46 --> 3313.18]  just that uh side to side pressure was unacceptable but um morca asks not for that why even show the
[3313.18 --> 3318.86]  ones you're not considering to show you guys kind of what we what we looked at to ultimately reach
[3318.86 --> 3323.98]  what we think is going to be our our best option so that you guys can understand the process are you
[3323.98 --> 3331.10]  complaining that we're just being transparent i don't get it if we're at risk if we use the fancy
[3331.10 --> 3337.74]  one if that was a thing we wouldn't use it um we will find a very good solution yeah people will be
[3337.74 --> 3342.54]  very happy with and everything will be okay yeah it'll be all right don't worry guys we got this yeah
[3342.54 --> 3352.54]  um all right oh in other it's not a recall in the sense that people have to send their bags back
[3353.50 --> 3359.98]  no yeah okay no it's i mean you can recall a component of something and the solution is just
[3359.98 --> 3363.82]  to send people a new that thing yeah yeah cool so that's the way we're going to handle it
[3363.82 --> 3366.54]  all right
[3369.42 --> 3378.86]  in other controversial news the urra ring or aura ring excuse me video got pulled from short circuit
[3378.86 --> 3386.62]  this week yeah i know nothing about this but that was very surprising yeah so uh our our history with
[3386.62 --> 3392.30]  aura and i'll explain why i've uh changed my pronunciation here in a moment our history with
[3392.30 --> 3397.66]  them is a little complicated first we were going to do a sponsored video for their gen 2 ring which
[3397.66 --> 3404.38]  they sent us and i used for a while and liked um then that never happened or maybe we shot it and
[3404.38 --> 3409.98]  like ultimately didn't publish it that somehow the deal fell through it's like okay you know it happens
[3409.98 --> 3417.02]  right um i liked the product i got an upgrade offer to the gen 3 ring that would make it so that i
[3417.02 --> 3421.98]  would not have to pay the monthly fee they basically said if you have a gen 2 ring and you upgrade to
[3421.98 --> 3427.98]  the gen 3 you will be grandfathered in for life to not have to pay the monthly subscription i was like
[3428.62 --> 3435.34]  i like this product i do not like monthly subscriptions fine gen 3 ring has some feature
[3435.34 --> 3440.62]  cool new features i don't really care about them but sure uh so i was using that for a while maybe
[3440.62 --> 3444.94]  they saw me using it i know a lot of you saw me using it and asked you know what's that what's that
[3444.94 --> 3449.66]  how do you like it etc etc so they find they reached out and they were like okay let's try this again
[3449.66 --> 3455.82]  so their new gen 3 horizon design they sent it over we shot a sponsored short circuit we got as far as
[3455.82 --> 3460.46]  uploading the video in the in the video i talked a lot about how it is a product i actually use i like
[3460.46 --> 3466.06]  it of course any sponsored video i still can't say anything i don't actually believe like by law
[3466.06 --> 3471.90]  some people don't take that very seriously i do so everything i said was stuff that i believed and one of
[3471.90 --> 3480.22]  the things i believed was that the pronunciation of their company o u r a was ura it's not it's aura
[3480.94 --> 3490.94]  like a u r a so to be completely honest i thought their company was named a u r a no it's o u r a
[3490.94 --> 3495.82]  because i i don't think i think i've heard you say it more than i've read it so i always just thought it
[3495.82 --> 3505.98]  was yeah anyways anywho um so i said it wrong repeatedly in the video because and this kind of
[3505.98 --> 3511.58]  ties into what i said earlier in the show about i only read things i don't watch or listen to them
[3511.58 --> 3519.58]  so i have only ever the only context i have is how it's spelled um and you know i i think that at this
[3519.58 --> 3525.02]  stage in our company we should probably have processes for making sure that the pronunciation
[3525.02 --> 3531.02]  of things particularly on a sponsored video is correct but it slipped through the cracks and
[3531.02 --> 3538.38]  we shot a whole video with the name wrong they were apparently very upset um and we offered a fix
[3538.38 --> 3544.22]  which was i think we were going to use the youtube editor to be like lol lines got the name pronounced
[3544.22 --> 3550.14]  wrong and a pinned comment uh they weren't happy with it and uh trigger happy newbie here by the name
[3550.14 --> 3555.98]  of colton uh reacted to this by pulling the video actually it was a it was a it was a decision that
[3555.98 --> 3561.98]  was made in the business department before i really got an opportunity to weigh in on it we were told that
[3563.98 --> 3571.42]  there was no way for us to make a change to the video to like alter the pronunciation um because of
[3571.42 --> 3576.14]  like youtube's policy but i was like okay yeah but like i might have been able to call people once the
[3576.14 --> 3580.14]  video is pulled it's like dead you can't like yeah you can put it live again but nobody's going to
[3580.14 --> 3586.54]  watch it like that initial burst from publishing unless it's you know a miracle viral video it's not
[3586.54 --> 3592.06]  gonna it's not nothing good it's gonna come of it if you republish it uh but so it was pulled so it was
[3592.06 --> 3596.30]  kind of too late to do anything about it um and i might have not been able to do anything about it anyway
[3596.30 --> 3603.10]  it might have been the same decision so uh really this is just about maintaining transparency for you guys
[3603.10 --> 3609.10]  not you know blaming anyone it was a team decision that was made i was not informed but i might have
[3609.66 --> 3615.82]  i might have made the same decision anyway so the bottom line is we pulled the video we're not putting
[3615.82 --> 3623.02]  it back up uh this isn't the first time we've had difficulty dealing with aura i like the product um
[3625.34 --> 3630.94]  but you know i don't think they're bad thing bad people or anything i just think it's fair to say that
[3630.94 --> 3635.34]  we are unlikely to attempt to work with them again at this point and it's left a bit of a bad taste in
[3635.34 --> 3643.34]  my mouth it wasn't entirely their fault for sure like you know i get it but also you know um i think their
[3643.34 --> 3651.82]  reaction was not really uh helpful i don't think it was really constructive i also don't think that it was an
[3651.82 --> 3660.78]  unmakeable mistake o u r a um i would have guessed ura yeah maybe you should have paid for
[3660.78 --> 3666.94]  you know the domain and trademark ara a u r a if that's what you wanted like you can't just spell
[3666.94 --> 3674.22]  stuff wrong and then be like why don't you pronounce it that like come on guys there's also like tons of
[3674.22 --> 3679.02]  different things like that that get quote unquote pronounced wrong uh someone in full plane chat uh
[3679.02 --> 3687.42]  mentioned nvidia tie yeah no one at nvidia even knows whether it's ti or tie or asus in general
[3687.42 --> 3695.58]  uh there's lots of them the the the better way to do it is to attack with humor um asus did that they made some like
[3696.70 --> 3699.58]  joke videos back in the day about how to pronounce their name and stuff
[3699.58 --> 3710.14]  um uh oh pooh lance gt in twitch chat says the oo ya pronounced it oo ya so it's not like i was coming at this
[3710.14 --> 3717.02]  completely out of nowhere i didn't i didn't even think about that like it's just one of the things is you never know where the root language is from
[3717.02 --> 3723.10]  so those letters in combination from different root languages might make different sounds and stuff
[3723.10 --> 3730.30]  like it's it's actually really hard to just read something in in uh you know english letters and know
[3730.30 --> 3735.26]  what it means cyan wave says i agree linus you should have done diligence and taken the error on the chin
[3735.26 --> 3741.26]  your fault uh yeah but it's not about fault you know like in business um you can you can take a very
[3741.26 --> 3747.10]  hard line stance like that but then you don't have a video given to tons of people about your product
[3747.10 --> 3752.14]  it's not constructive right like it's about it's about finding a fix that works for everyone and
[3752.14 --> 3760.70]  getting it done right so yeah sure assign blame go ahead but it's not helpful right so it's it's about
[3760.70 --> 3766.14]  what are you trying to do are you trying to just kill a relationship and never work together again then
[3766.14 --> 3771.18]  by all means be like that right but if you're trying to fix it and trying to move forward which
[3771.18 --> 3776.30]  is what smart business people do then you got to take a different stance right like you gotta
[3776.94 --> 3782.94]  i i i mean anyone that i've ever coached on email etiquette probably including you uh one of the first
[3782.94 --> 3787.42]  things i'll tell you is even though you know a hundred percent that it's the other person's fault and
[3787.42 --> 3791.90]  that they're an idiot and they're ass covering or whatever the first thing you do is say
[3791.90 --> 3797.66]  i'm sorry i might have misunderstood i might have yeah that's actually been one of the most
[3797.66 --> 3803.26]  useful things too because a lot of the times you can be like 95 98 sure you're right
[3805.34 --> 3810.06]  but if you say i might have misunderstood it's very likely you'll get more information yeah and then they
[3810.06 --> 3815.02]  will end up figuring out that they made the mistake which is just easier for everyone it's simple math
[3815.02 --> 3820.14]  the second you attack someone they will be defensive it's a battle now they are on the they're on the
[3820.14 --> 3825.02]  the defense and a lot of situations you don't want a battle you want a resolution because you
[3825.02 --> 3830.30]  just want the problem to be fixed so it's it's easier to just be like whatever i might have
[3830.30 --> 3835.42]  misunderstood is a way to say like i'm not placing blame but let's just solve the problem which is
[3835.42 --> 3839.74]  better m hindman says linus stop putting your foot in it in that last segment you throw your staff under
[3839.74 --> 3847.02]  the bus and criticize the sponsor i'm telling you guys what happened that's what happened what what
[3847.02 --> 3854.94]  what more can i say did did i say that that i pronounced it right no did i say i did my due
[3854.94 --> 3861.34]  diligence no did i say i pronounced it wrong and that i didn't do my due diligence yes okay what like
[3861.34 --> 3865.18]  what do you guys what do you guys what like what ultimately what do you want from me right like what
[3865.18 --> 3871.66]  can i do um what can i do other than be transparent should i just not tell you things
[3871.66 --> 3877.66]  i feel like we've run into this a fair bit lately i've brought this up before this is actually a
[3877.66 --> 3883.26]  really big problem i the way i brought it up is devs on stage yeah a lot of people want to hear
[3883.26 --> 3889.18]  directly from developers very often uh but then when a developer missteps or says something slightly
[3889.18 --> 3894.78]  incorrectly or says a thing that people decide that they they shouldn't have uh one of the examples
[3894.78 --> 3899.90]  that i bring up is the yeah don't you guys have phones comment from the blizzard developer like
[3899.90 --> 3904.86]  yeah that was stupid of course both other people in this room cringed when when i said it yes that
[3904.86 --> 3911.74]  was really stupid but the more you really heavily attack stuff like that yeah the less devs on stage
[3911.74 --> 3915.90]  that's true because they're gonna throw a pr person at you i'm like is that really what you want
[3917.18 --> 3920.46]  because you got you got to think about what you're attacking what you're criticizing right
[3920.46 --> 3925.02]  it gets it gets a little sketchy if you want the real information if you want the knowledge
[3925.02 --> 3930.70]  whatever you got to be a little you got to take it sometimes yeah and sometimes that dev on stage
[3930.70 --> 3937.18]  is gonna say something real dumb but you still want that dev on stage all right you think you want
[3937.18 --> 3942.06]  it but you don't yeah that's another quote blizzard has a lot of them but blizzard has put
[3942.86 --> 3947.98]  devs on stage at blizzcon for a long time so like it makes sense they're gonna say some dumb stuff
[3947.98 --> 3956.30]  um and it is what it is on the subject of dumb stuff the lab 32 branding is officially dead
[3956.30 --> 3964.14]  such i want to make it very clear that it had nothing to do with sarah dici she was an absolute
[3964.14 --> 3971.58]  gem about the whole thing uh she basically was like yeah i mean seems pretty chill to me um here's you know
[3971.58 --> 3977.50]  what we have have i talked about this already on my own show no i don't think so i've gotten like a deja
[3977.50 --> 3980.70]  vu moment well at any rate i've talked about the cancellation of the name yeah you've talked about
[3980.70 --> 3985.42]  the the situation that's going on but i don't think you've talked about us oh not right with the name
[3985.42 --> 3991.34]  so she was super chill about it amazing she was like yeah we'll we'll make it work we'll figure it out
[3991.34 --> 3999.18]  and ultimately because we found out that there was a 30 day return period for the domain we kind of went
[3999.18 --> 4009.18]  yeah thank you sarah for real like what a bro uh but we're just gonna we're just gonna figure out
[4009.18 --> 4014.14]  something else so that we don't have to worry about any kind of misunderstanding like i don't want
[4014.14 --> 4020.14]  people misunderstanding us misunderstanding her confusing the two companies thinking they're affiliated
[4020.14 --> 4027.90]  and there was already some people that seemed genuinely confused so especially because they
[4027.90 --> 4033.90]  launched within the same week like or at least were announced within the same week so in a full
[4033.90 --> 4036.86]  plane chat said what about lab 32 version 2 by 2
[4043.42 --> 4044.78]  super speed lab 32
[4044.78 --> 4053.90]  that's pretty good um i don't i haven't heard any plans for anything different has there
[4054.46 --> 4058.14]  do you have maybe no public thoughts on that i'm assuming
[4060.14 --> 4064.54]  um sorry but on a new name on a new name other than lab 32
[4066.30 --> 4070.78]  because you're walking back the branding yeah you have any that you're leaving towards even privately i
[4070.78 --> 4076.30]  don't well yeah privately i feel like we could we could just go for
[4078.70 --> 4079.58]  man i don't know
[4082.70 --> 4089.58]  i think privately lttlabs.com in in my mind is just kind of the obvious one at this point we tried
[4089.58 --> 4095.74]  we have it right yeah yeah we we tried to do something else and i did just maybe give up we can
[4095.74 --> 4100.62]  we can run with it i think there's some people on the on the team that don't want to do that oh there's
[4100.62 --> 4107.42]  there's some people on the team that really don't want to do that but for better or for worse it has
[4107.42 --> 4116.38]  a lot of brand equity we already own it it's easy it is easy and we do already own it and it is very
[4116.38 --> 4122.06]  like people will know that it's us working on it and it hits all those points and that's good um but
[4122.06 --> 4132.78]  yeah yeah uh there's there's another topic we can jump into uh lab 64 wasn't available for those of
[4132.78 --> 4138.54]  you asking that's also really yeah and part of the part of the beauty of lab 32 was that it could be
[4138.54 --> 4146.06]  ltt if we ever decided to retcon the linus tech tips meaning of ltt lab 32 yeah thanks for clarifying
[4146.06 --> 4149.34]  well i think a lot of people didn't get that last time we talked about it right you've mentioned that
[4149.34 --> 4153.74]  before and i think it whiffed like a ton of people so i'm trying to try to make it because i think
[4154.62 --> 4161.34]  the domain was numerical so i think people didn't put that together right that makes sense yeah all
[4161.34 --> 4168.46]  right what do you want to talk about next um should we talk about dbrand lab 69 also wasn't available
[4168.46 --> 4178.46]  we did check oh yeah yeah yeah let's talk about dbrand's thing yikes bad situation do you know about this
[4178.46 --> 4184.78]  i didn't actually uh the magnet used to attach the kickstand to the rear of the kill switch case
[4184.78 --> 4192.22]  can affect the rpm of the internal fan of certain steam decks that's a problem yeah that's not good
[4192.22 --> 4196.30]  valve was initially shipping the steam deck with fans from two different oh
[4196.30 --> 4207.50]  that sucks okay so they were shipping the fans for two different suppliers so tldr i haven't even read
[4207.50 --> 4211.98]  it yet but i'm sure it's going to go there one of the fans is not going to be affected by this and i'm
[4211.98 --> 4217.34]  sure this is the one that the dbrand was working with uh the dbrand that dbrand was working with and
[4217.34 --> 4222.14]  the other one is affected by it so yeah it sounds like the delta version of the fans are affected by the
[4222.14 --> 4228.54]  magnet and then i have no idea how to pronounce this hua ying hua ying hua ying probably i don't know
[4228.54 --> 4235.18]  yeah sure uh those ones are not affected by the magnet um yeah and okay yeah steam decks used by d
[4235.18 --> 4243.34]  brand for testing all have the hua ying fans or however they're pronounced fan speeds dropped by 1500
[4243.34 --> 4248.70]  to 2500 rpm that's a big problem that's a huge problem this is the mobile device you don't screw
[4248.70 --> 4253.18]  around with cooling for a mobile device yeah they're usually pre-dialed in it's not cool yeah
[4255.02 --> 4263.10]  yeah yeah this fan behavior went unnoticed by other content creators press outlets until the verge
[4263.10 --> 4269.50]  were shipped a few kill switch cases dbrand borrowed a delta fan equipped model from youtuber a really
[4269.50 --> 4276.78]  cool guy dave 2d and confirmed the findings by the verge after confirming the issue dbrand made an 11th
[4276.78 --> 4284.54]  hour decision to suspend all kill switch sales per dbrand word on the grapevine is that valve no longer
[4284.54 --> 4291.58]  uses the whiny delta fan in the production of steam decks switching exclusively to the hua ying component
[4291.58 --> 4294.14]  which is the one that isn't affected so that's
[4296.70 --> 4301.82]  good i guess yeah but they're still out there yeah and we don't we have no way of knowing who's gonna
[4301.82 --> 4307.26]  know which one it is without taking it apart and yeah as cool it is as it is that you can do that
[4307.26 --> 4313.10]  most users are not going to want to do that um after confirming the issue dbrand may oh yeah yeah i
[4313.10 --> 4319.26]  think i already said that but they're they're suspending all kill switch sales which sucks per dbrand oh i
[4319.26 --> 4325.66]  already talked about all this where am i the issue is limited to the magnetic kickstand the case itself
[4325.66 --> 4330.14]  travel cover stick grips and tempered glass screen protectors do not cause any issues
[4330.14 --> 4337.98]  uh so that we know of yet yeah yeah probably not okay so maybe we'll see those separately or something
[4337.98 --> 4342.70]  i should be fine that's it's there's no magnets in the other ones so it should be fine yeah
[4344.54 --> 4352.54]  oh and unfortunately because i thought the magnetic system was super cool well i don't think it's
[4352.54 --> 4358.46]  necessarily going away it is in response to this discovery dbrand is pivoting from the magnetic
[4358.46 --> 4363.18]  mount to a mechanical interlocking system for the kickstand and future accessories so what's
[4363.18 --> 4367.98]  going to happen is if you already ordered a magnetic version one you're going to get that
[4367.98 --> 4372.22]  and then they're going to also send you a mechanical one just in case you find it causes
[4372.22 --> 4375.90]  a problem with your system in case well because you that's the thing you might not notice it causes
[4375.90 --> 4382.46]  a problem oh so they want people using the mechanical one now i a savvy user
[4382.46 --> 4389.26]  i'm gonna open up my steam deck make sure i've got a wai ying fan and i'm gonna use my i'm gonna use
[4389.26 --> 4399.26]  my magnetic one five ever but that's not gonna help anyone else uh if you have a delta one you can
[4399.26 --> 4405.90]  buy a steam deck fan replacement from i fix it yes that's true i can't tell if this is delta or wai ying
[4405.90 --> 4412.70]  um but considering they said they're gonna stop working with it should be wai ying yep um so that's
[4413.82 --> 4418.46]  that's an option if it comes down to that rough day for dbrand yeah that sucks you don't want to go
[4418.46 --> 4423.74]  through all that product development everything and have have a problem like oh all the units that
[4423.74 --> 4429.02]  you had happened to have the fan that it would be fine with like that's so unfortunate that just sucks
[4429.02 --> 4437.82]  but whoa we just got rated on twitch seven people showed up nice nice thanks let's go and rose thank
[4437.82 --> 4444.78]  you uh braiding is braiding braiding is a weird thing to me yeah but hey thanks it can be cool welcome
[4444.78 --> 4450.86]  raiders yeah indeed all seven of us there's literally half dozen of us should we talk about my absolutely
[4450.86 --> 4456.22]  thrilling night last night yeah what what are you what are you talking about he's been talking about
[4456.22 --> 4461.90]  this like he's been vague posting all day about this i just i wanted to talk to you about it because
[4461.90 --> 4466.78]  it's very uh absurd and i knew you'd laugh at me for it and it'd be a fun conversation so i just
[4466.78 --> 4471.58]  decided that hey we don't always get to talk that often might as well just do it on wanshow i sure i guess
[4471.58 --> 4478.06]  so um so i mean we talked a lot like yesterday but sure that's probably true yesterday no yeah because
[4478.06 --> 4482.06]  i was gonna say i would have talked to you about this yeah we talked for like two hours on wednesday
[4482.06 --> 4485.98]  but yeah we don't talk this hadn't happened yeah whatever sure this hadn't happened yet yeah sure
[4485.98 --> 4496.22]  uh um so i was wandering around various parks with a gigantic bird cage playing bird noises from my phone
[4496.78 --> 4507.02]  uh trying to not look crazy you lost your birds so i'm smiling because no it wasn't ours but someone else did
[4507.02 --> 4515.66]  oh so we were trying to help emma my girlfriend found her name's public it's fine emma found she was
[4515.66 --> 4521.02]  walking around a park for funsies and she found her name public oh yeah i guess she streams i i mean
[4521.02 --> 4525.98]  i just try to call it plenty time yeah yeah i mean i'm usually i usually try to do that for people that
[4525.98 --> 4533.58]  i'm not 100 sure of but i'm sure of her uh she found a little posted little sign thing begging for help
[4533.58 --> 4539.90]  in a park and was like we kind of know how to do this so she was going at it pretty hard and eventually
[4539.90 --> 4546.22]  convinced me to come help and the strategy which does actually kind of work is that you walk around
[4546.22 --> 4554.70]  with a cage because a lot of like house tamed birds understand that cage usually means water food and safety
[4554.70 --> 4562.78]  right okay and you play bird noises because budgies are like super super flock animals and the second they hear
[4562.78 --> 4570.22]  chirping they chirp back and then they want to come join it so it'll like get them to come to you and then when they get to you
[4570.22 --> 4575.98]  they see like oh cage and food and water and this is that thing that i used to go into and when i would go into it
[4575.98 --> 4582.70]  things were good so it's very likely that they'll actually go inside right also there had been some sightings of the bird not by us
[4582.70 --> 4588.06]  and it was trying to socialize with people and the people would like take a picture of it and then walk away
[4588.06 --> 4596.94]  budgies are not native to bc if that happens try to get it because it is someone's bird and it will die and it will die
[4596.94 --> 4603.58]  yeah like it's it was very scary for the actually days that it that it was out it was very surprised it
[4603.58 --> 4610.46]  survived that long um we unfortunately weren't the ones that ended up finding it someone else did but it got
[4610.46 --> 4616.78]  another bird owner found it oh wow um but yeah it got found because again it wants to be
[4617.82 --> 4623.18]  it was going up to people being like hey help me there's pictures there's a picture online of it
[4623.18 --> 4629.66]  sitting on a jungle gym next to some kid trying to be like hey and you can tell from the body language if
[4629.66 --> 4636.22]  you know birds you can tell from the body language it's like pay attention to me hello and there's other
[4636.22 --> 4641.82]  pictures of it like sitting on a on a park bench next to people just like on the park bench amongst
[4641.82 --> 4647.82]  people like it was clearly uh comfortable with people and trying to get help and people just kept
[4647.82 --> 4656.86]  taking pictures of it obviously a pet yeah which was crazy to me but i don't know um but yeah the person
[4656.86 --> 4663.66]  the person that found it had birds but was not a part of the actual rescue operation they just like
[4663.66 --> 4669.98]  happened to find it um and and our our concern right now is that no one knows who the actual
[4669.98 --> 4674.94]  owner is it was just a bunch of people reporting like this is clearly someone's bird oh so we don't
[4674.94 --> 4679.18]  know don't know who the owner yeah oh i might have said that oddly at the beginning but yeah i thought
[4679.18 --> 4684.70]  you were helping the owner so the the report i mean i guess you were but the report was that someone had
[4684.70 --> 4692.14]  seen the social posts and immediately clued in that it was someone's bird but it wasn't their bird but
[4692.14 --> 4698.38]  they were like we should try to help this whoever this bird this is so the person that has it um
[4699.26 --> 4703.50]  doesn't really want to like bring it to a vet and stuff and it's like being all weird about it and
[4703.50 --> 4711.42]  kind of wants to keep it but there's nothing that like we can do about it so it's a weird night but
[4711.98 --> 4718.78]  there's like a halfway happy ending it's no longer outdoors where it has a huge chance of not surviving
[4718.78 --> 4722.94]  right so that's good now it's indoors where it also has a huge chance of not surviving there's a
[4722.94 --> 4730.14]  concern there yep that's a thing yeah luke's had some bad luck it's yeah it's been better lately but
[4730.46 --> 4736.38]  birds are very fragile especially really tiny birds they get sick very quickly they're flock
[4736.38 --> 4741.74]  animals they don't want the flock to abandon them so they try to hide their sickness um and they don't
[4741.74 --> 4749.18]  exactly have a lot of mass so they they tend to die very quickly um does the bird have microchips i i
[4749.18 --> 4753.82]  don't know we weren't the ones that caught it i don't think so can you microchip a bird usually you
[4753.82 --> 4759.66]  put a little band yeah around its foot yeah microchips are very different yeah it's like an injection i
[4759.66 --> 4765.34]  knew what they meant yeah someone else said is it banded yeah so i don't i don't if from the pictures
[4765.34 --> 4773.18]  i don't remember i don't think it was though um but yeah that was that was interesting i uh i was
[4773.18 --> 4777.58]  talking to my girlfriend afterwards and she was talking about how when she's walking because she's
[4777.58 --> 4782.14]  doing the same thing she took the small cage i had a really big one my hands were very unhappy by the
[4782.14 --> 4787.34]  end of it yeah it's just this like wire yeah i have to hold the cage on um but she's walking around
[4787.34 --> 4793.18]  playing budgie noises um and holding this cage and a bunch of people apparently were like talking to
[4793.18 --> 4796.78]  you're like oh what are you doing whatever no one talked to me
[4799.66 --> 4805.90]  not a single person i had a lot of people that were like jogging and they just gotta love pretty
[4805.90 --> 4816.06]  privilege hey yeah look it up it's a thing just people would like avoid eye contact they'd run by
[4816.06 --> 4824.14]  i had um one one old dude who's going for a walk i walked by him and he's like on in the middle of
[4824.14 --> 4828.54]  the track and he's like walking with a cane and stuff so i go off the track yeah and walk in the
[4828.54 --> 4834.38]  grass just so he has an easy time um and i i notice i can just tell that he has completely stopped and
[4834.38 --> 4840.78]  turned around and just stared at me as i walk away i've seen a lot of things in my life but i had never
[4840.78 --> 4846.22]  seen that before the amount of kids that would like hear the bird sounds see that i'm holding a
[4846.22 --> 4850.94]  cage and like get kind of excited and look at the cage and then realize there's no bird and just look
[4850.94 --> 4856.30]  at me really confused and like what's happening yeah you have a new nickname in float plane chat by
[4856.30 --> 4861.10]  the way local nutter luke yeah i mean probably
[4863.74 --> 4870.62]  i was trying to help okay oh man but yeah we went to like there's a lot of little parks around that area
[4870.78 --> 4879.34]  and uh the the rescue group had like tracked the movements and stuff um so we were trying to
[4879.34 --> 4884.94]  figure out like where he would probably be next yeah um it's amazing how the difference between nice
[4884.94 --> 4897.90]  helper and terrifying person is like a y chromosome and like 75 pounds you know yeah yeah yeah um anyway
[4897.90 --> 4905.50]  should we talk about do you want to talk about ryzen 7000 versus 13th gen do you want to talk about
[4905.50 --> 4910.22]  the fight let's talk about the fight let's talk about the actually no we just did a non-tech topic
[4910.22 --> 4917.58]  let's talk about the right tech topic yeah yeah um all right general consensus on ryzen 7000 these are
[4917.58 --> 4923.42]  some incredible chips that are bringing massive gains like 20 to 30 improvements over their last gen
[4923.42 --> 4929.74]  counterparts in gaming and productivity the 7950x is undoubtedly the fastest mainstream cpu available
[4929.74 --> 4936.46]  and dominates everyone in productivity tasks but the expense of the platform is a real issue
[4939.34 --> 4944.62]  is this is this amd i'm talking yeah that's weird or is this intel you don't you don't think like
[4944.62 --> 4951.50]  insanely the so my understanding is yeah the boards are like 500 each yep that's crazy that we are seeing
[4951.50 --> 4958.30]  prices that are lower now that was just right at launch we're seeing as low as 250 bucks for an azarok
[4958.30 --> 4967.66]  x670 pg x670 e pg lightning but am5 only supports ddr5 which remains twice as expensive per gig as
[4967.66 --> 4975.66]  comparable ddr4 and the other issue as we outlined in our review is that amd's own ryzen 7 5800x 3d
[4975.66 --> 4983.50]  has gaming performance that matches that of the new 7700x and only legs behind the ryzen 9s by like
[4983.50 --> 4991.18]  a couple of percent on average so for gamers the upgrade to am5 is currently not looking like a great
[4991.18 --> 4999.74]  value especially because am4 boards and chips are cheap and cheerful and here's the thing you can look
[4999.74 --> 5006.14]  at am4 and you can go well there's no upgrade path and that's nice but not everybody can actually
[5006.14 --> 5013.10]  afford the latest generation version of the am4 platform i have never been super sold on on board
[5013.10 --> 5020.94]  upgrade paths what if you are buying a ryzen 2000 today because you want to like get a deal okay
[5022.06 --> 5029.58]  am4 for you has an upgrade path a couple years from now three years from now boom you go ryzen
[5029.58 --> 5037.18]  5000 with that same board you just got a big upgrade and probably for cheap yeah right so
[5037.18 --> 5045.66]  enough you gotta think not everybody is thinking in terms of brand new today yeah um and and especially
[5045.66 --> 5050.62]  these days we're like okay the performance jumps we're seeing on some of the hardware that's coming
[5050.62 --> 5059.18]  out is immense like actually just huge yeah but the performance that people need at the same time
[5059.18 --> 5064.70]  to reach like competitive frame rates and stuff is not huge and it's not increasing at anywhere near
[5064.70 --> 5069.02]  the same rate so the gap between people's computer upgrades is getting like bigger and bigger and
[5069.02 --> 5073.50]  bigger as far as i can tell so you don't necessarily need to upgrade your cpu within generation every
[5073.50 --> 5079.98]  single time but you definitely don't want to upgrade at all if the motherboard's minimum cost is
[5079.98 --> 5086.86]  500 which again it's gone down but still that's really intense um when we looked at productivity
[5086.86 --> 5094.78]  the 7600x and 7700x were another issue they don't really offer compelling performance over intel's 12th
[5094.78 --> 5102.62]  gen mainstream chips although their higher core counts oh though the higher core counts on the 7900x and 7950x
[5102.62 --> 5109.26]  allow them to run away with the productivity crown but that's an issue has amd done it again have they gone
[5109.26 --> 5113.66]  from the expensive brand that's not really competitive in the mid-range and low end
[5117.02 --> 5121.10]  there have also been concerns expressed by the community around how hot these chips get they will
[5121.10 --> 5127.58]  often run at 95 degrees on the hottest core before dialing back but amd says that this is by design
[5127.58 --> 5133.18]  and if you want you can target 115 degrees with an overclock before throttling and hard crashes will happen
[5133.74 --> 5139.02]  so far we've been unable to get any of our chips to run hotter than 105 and we're not sure
[5139.02 --> 5144.22]  why my current computer like heats my house i don't i don't need more of that well here's the thing
[5144.78 --> 5154.06]  how hot the dye is in degrees celsius is not indicative of how much heat it outputs you could
[5154.06 --> 5160.38]  have a router that has its cpu running at 100 degrees yeah yeah yeah it's not outputting a lot of heat
[5160.38 --> 5167.82]  the thermals are just not being properly managed you could have a 300 watt chip that is running at 70
[5167.82 --> 5175.74]  degrees with liquid cooling on it and it is still kicking 300 watts into your room it's just not
[5175.74 --> 5181.82]  running hot if you guys kind of understand what i mean conservation of energy all right it doesn't
[5181.82 --> 5189.50]  matter what temperature it's at it matters how much actual uh power it is consuming and therefore
[5189.50 --> 5195.18]  thermal energy it is outputting in terms of maintaining room temperatures yeah what were
[5195.18 --> 5201.02]  you gonna say uh der bauer did some stuff with that as well is that in here yeah he he delitted
[5201.02 --> 5206.54]  the 7900x dropped like i think it's i think it was like 20 degrees or something yeah so there is
[5206.54 --> 5211.42]  some speculation that amd may have sacrificed thermal performance to maintain cooler compatibility with
[5211.42 --> 5216.94]  am4 coolers in which case good guy amd but i haven't seen any confirmation of that um
[5218.38 --> 5222.86]  what we didn't touch on in our review performance scaling with ram speeds so we'll have to follow that
[5222.86 --> 5227.34]  up i was gonna say that was kind of interesting to me and immediately made me think like okay there's
[5227.34 --> 5232.70]  going to be another video eco mode uh a lower power consumption mode for the cpu and manual
[5232.70 --> 5239.82]  overclocking now in the same week actually the next day intel didn't launch but announced their 13th
[5239.82 --> 5247.26]  gen processors uh with most of the details really being around the flagship 13 900k 5.8 gigahertz
[5247.26 --> 5255.66]  turbo 24 cores now 16 of those are efficiency or e-course and only eight of them are their performance
[5255.66 --> 5264.54]  cores but 24 cores and their e-course aren't that slow they're like sky lake level like they're not
[5264.54 --> 5273.58]  they're not bad and 589 dollars uh the presentation was kind of fun 24 performance improvement in games
[5273.58 --> 5279.26]  in some games one game is league of legends i think it was league of legends i didn't know it was one
[5279.26 --> 5283.98]  it's like league of legends or dota i thought it was gonna be like two or three at least uh 34 faster in
[5283.98 --> 5289.98]  game development blender ue5 uh the core i5 and core i7 see similar but lesser improvements to speed
[5289.98 --> 5296.62]  cache size and core count and the real winner is efficiency gains okay intel alleges that at 65 watts
[5296.62 --> 5303.18]  the 13 900k so they also i guess might have like a similar eco mode uh performs on par with a 12 900k at
[5303.18 --> 5308.14]  241 watts in a multi-threaded workload that's a quarter of the power consumption if that holds true
[5308.14 --> 5313.42]  the big one though is that intel is gonna have the affordable platform
[5314.46 --> 5321.10]  yeah you can pick up a 13th gen chip a z690 board rather than 790 because 790 only acts add some more
[5321.10 --> 5326.86]  gen 4 lanes and usb bandwidth so you can get a last gen board or b660 board doesn't matter as long as it's
[5326.86 --> 5333.98]  got a good enough vrm you get some ddr4 memory you throw this 13th gen chip on there and to be clear
[5333.98 --> 5338.70]  we are going to check this out for you guys we're going to make sure that with ddr4 it actually
[5338.70 --> 5340.86]  performs well um
[5345.74 --> 5350.30]  and you're going to be able you're going to have like a latest gen platform for literally hundreds
[5350.30 --> 5354.46]  of dollars less i don't necessarily think the motherboard thing is going to stay the same
[5354.46 --> 5360.62]  though if we've already seen the availability pop up with boards that are half the price of what we
[5360.62 --> 5366.30]  were originally talking about no okay so no amd's boards will come down the boards will come down
[5366.30 --> 5373.26]  but they haven't launched their budget chipset yet and for 13th gen neither has intel but because
[5373.26 --> 5378.70]  you're able to use a last gen board and all you're missing out on is some pcie lanes on the on the south
[5378.70 --> 5382.46]  bridge i don't know what they call it anymore but whatever the motherboard chipset io hub because
[5382.46 --> 5389.10]  you're just missing out on some pcie lanes and usb ports for gamers you're not giving up anything
[5389.10 --> 5393.98]  you go for your last gen board with the cheapo mainstream chipset you put your latest gen chip
[5393.98 --> 5399.66]  you put your last gen memory that's another thing ddr5 yeah it's going to come down in price but it
[5399.66 --> 5405.10]  sure as heck isn't today yeah and you might be building a system today now this is the kind of
[5405.10 --> 5411.42]  competition i love to see because it's going to be back and forth for 14th gen right intel's probably
[5411.42 --> 5417.90]  going to do their thing where a socket socket compatibility is only maintained for two generations
[5417.90 --> 5423.50]  so it'll be a whole new platform with whole new expensive boards right meanwhile amd is going to
[5423.50 --> 5428.70]  have budget like b760 or i've i forget what their what their budget boards are going to be called for
[5428.70 --> 5433.50]  this new platform six something anyway whatever they're going to have new boards ddr5 might be
[5433.50 --> 5439.18]  closer to price parity by that point and amd is all of a sudden going to look like the good bet i i but i
[5439.18 --> 5446.86]  love it it's back and forth it's it's it's punches and you know i i just i i love seeing them duke it
[5446.86 --> 5452.46]  out i love okay a lot of people say they want competition but they don't really want competition
[5452.86 --> 5459.02]  they want someone to make a product that's like good enough to keep the brand that they like honest
[5459.02 --> 5463.10]  and they're just going to buy that brand no matter what that other company comes out with but this is
[5463.10 --> 5469.58]  true competition this is this is two real options yeah that's cool not just something that's like
[5469.58 --> 5478.78]  good enough that that the monopolist can't price it at whatever they want i am i'm stoked i think the
[5478.78 --> 5483.74]  brand wars are going to cook up because of that because for the last little while it's just been
[5483.74 --> 5489.58]  like buy amd buy mdi buy md but now that there's hopefully good arguments both ways depending on like
[5489.58 --> 5493.02]  specifically what you're doing all that kind of stuff should make things a little bit more interesting
[5493.58 --> 5500.22]  and i mean you've got mid-cycle refreshes man mid-cycle refreshes are a thing now amd's already
[5500.22 --> 5506.22]  talking about adding 3d vcash intel already teased a ks version of this chip at over five gigahertz
[5506.22 --> 5515.50]  or six rather uh yeah it's exciting it's exciting yeah it's good you want to talk about the fight yes
[5515.50 --> 5521.90]  spoiler alert if you haven't seen the latest channel super fun we will be talking about the result of the
[5521.90 --> 5532.70]  epic epic epic battle between me and dennis um for context you know i i again like it's it's it's so
[5532.70 --> 5539.58]  tedious uh seeing you know my my words and actions taken in the worst possible light um so for context
[5540.46 --> 5548.46]  no i did not require dennis to fight me so that i could like prove my manhood or something i don't know
[5548.46 --> 5553.34]  a lot more interesting if you did i don't know what you're talking about dennis challenged me to a
[5553.34 --> 5562.22]  fight um and what he told me was that he was sick of hearing me complain about my scratched floor so
[5562.86 --> 5570.30]  if he won i could never talk about it again and uh obviously this was for content he thought it was a
[5570.30 --> 5576.70]  really good video concept i agreed so we greenlit it and the challenge was that dennis was going to be
[5576.70 --> 5581.98]  allowed some amount of time to train it was not a lot of it was not like a normal amount of time
[5581.98 --> 5587.18]  for a fight yeah like i think it was like a couple weeks or something like that yeah like actually two
[5587.18 --> 5591.58]  yeah like it was well he he had more time than that he could have trained but he wasn't filming a
[5591.58 --> 5596.70]  lot of fights are like months out oh oh yeah i mean i i remember being like blown away because i
[5596.70 --> 5601.50]  didn't realize how demanding it is when i found out that like top fighters would fight like once a year
[5601.50 --> 5606.54]  yeah i was like oh okay yeah well and they train specifically for that fight sometimes they're
[5606.54 --> 5610.78]  moving weight classes like there's a lot of things involved with it however i will say this dennis
[5610.78 --> 5617.10]  trained a lot more than me which was zero i help out in my in my girls class okay yeah that's i was
[5617.10 --> 5621.18]  gonna ask about that because we had talked and you said that you didn't train anymore no and then when
[5621.18 --> 5626.54]  i watched the video there was footage of you there yeah but like you looked a little rigid and like you
[5626.54 --> 5631.26]  weren't really training so i was wondering like were you doing a demonstration yeah yeah okay yeah
[5631.26 --> 5637.90]  i was i'm i'm there to be like uh like a black belt helper in the class um and like i go around and
[5637.90 --> 5641.90]  help help correct form and stuff like that like i don't remember any of my patterns or anything like
[5641.90 --> 5646.54]  that so i'm like but you can see when something's like obviously wrong yeah and like if the if the if
[5646.54 --> 5653.50]  the master is like uh yeah can you help them with with this i'm like okay how's that go again yeah yeah no
[5653.50 --> 5658.22]  problem got it like i can immediately pick things up again because it's all stuff i've done before
[5658.22 --> 5663.02]  it's just 20 years right yeah yeah yeah um so that's what i that's what i was doing i'm not actually
[5664.22 --> 5670.86]  like training or anything like that so the challenge was dennis would get a couple weeks to train and i
[5670.86 --> 5677.42]  would be going in cold yeah hold on you're making that face but dennis has as much martial arts training
[5677.42 --> 5682.86]  as i do no i i made that face has a black belt because i was reminded of the the fact that he's doing so
[5682.86 --> 5689.34]  this was this was a specifically taekwondo fight yes and he went he went to a krav maga well i don't
[5689.34 --> 5696.54]  know look he didn't ask me for advice on how he should train so like yeah he spent two weeks training
[5697.90 --> 5705.98]  he also did some weird stuff in that like i mean krav maga was super cool but like so what okay not for
[5705.98 --> 5711.50]  this i think there are other ways he could have done it but i do understand why he did it why he did
[5711.50 --> 5716.38]  krav maga why okay the reason he did that is because dennis's biggest problem is that all you
[5716.38 --> 5720.86]  have to do is move fast near him fear thing and you're like yeah yeah you're like flinches right
[5721.42 --> 5727.42]  he's a flinchy boy and so you actually saw that in the beginning of the video when i was laughing at
[5727.42 --> 5732.94]  him because i was like i was basically i've been teasing him off camera as well i'm like dude you're
[5732.94 --> 5737.50]  not you don't have a chance because all i have to do is go like oh yeah you did that yeah yeah yeah and it
[5737.50 --> 5742.30]  worked right he was and he's like you can't do that yeah he was trying not to flinch because i'd
[5742.30 --> 5746.30]  already been doing that to him for like a week like every time i saw him i'd be like yeah dennis
[5747.18 --> 5752.46]  that actually makes a lot more sense yes because i haven't watched the whole video yet but he he the
[5752.46 --> 5757.58]  the krav maga guy is like okay we gotta do this because you need to like drop your nerves and like
[5757.58 --> 5762.54]  be able to be more calm exactly so that was the whole goal okay exactly so he was trying to be less
[5762.54 --> 5771.18]  twitchy yeah and and less like freak outy uh when whenever something i will say at the fight
[5772.78 --> 5779.26]  maybe that actually really worked because he didn't do that like at all really he did some moves that
[5779.26 --> 5787.34]  were very derpy um like keeping his arms down like this and other stuff like that okay so we should talk
[5787.34 --> 5793.10]  we should talk about the fight yeah uh man this is this is the kind of stuff i'm talking about uh oh
[5793.10 --> 5798.86]  yeah i lost because i didn't train yeah yeah i didn't lose yeah have you watched the video
[5800.38 --> 5805.42]  why do you even watch this show like if you're actually just going away if you're going to take
[5805.42 --> 5812.14]  everything i do and say in the worst possible way yeah you must hate me right because everything i do is
[5812.14 --> 5819.34]  awful um okay stop reading yet yeah so let's talk so let's talk about the fight uh first of all i
[5819.34 --> 5826.70]  want to say massive respect to dennis yeah he did way better than i expected dan did you watch it
[5827.42 --> 5831.26]  have you watched the video already no i haven't seen it yet you haven't seen it no you should watch
[5831.26 --> 5839.42]  it's really good so a dennis put up a way way better fight than i expected and b it's a really good video
[5839.42 --> 5845.90]  yeah the the the like the the training and the behind the scenes uh you guys i i'm not going to
[5845.90 --> 5853.82]  spoil everything but dennis put some serious thought and energy into both giving himself his best chance
[5853.82 --> 5860.14]  possible and sabotaging me in the most underhanded ways possible funny i heard about that without me
[5860.14 --> 5863.34]  realizing funny at all um
[5866.22 --> 5875.90]  however i wasn't super thrilled with how the rules of the fight not at all the format of the fight i hated
[5875.90 --> 5883.18]  it played out yeah um i would say that a lot of people were confused about the scoring
[5883.18 --> 5891.10]  so for one thing i i will say that the scoring was not actually as abhorrent as it appeared to be in
[5891.10 --> 5896.86]  the video it the way the way that it works and dennis only flashed up like the scoring system for a
[5896.86 --> 5901.90]  second before taking it away which i guess kind of makes sense in keeping the video's pacing moving
[5901.90 --> 5907.58]  quickly but might not make sense in terms of people understanding what they're watching the way the scoring worked
[5907.58 --> 5915.26]  was that a strike to the body to the front or the side i think is one point with the hands a strike to
[5915.26 --> 5922.14]  the body front or side with the legs is two points um a take down so getting the other opponent's
[5922.14 --> 5927.90]  shoulders on the ground that's two points and then i think it was a spinning a kick to the head is either
[5927.90 --> 5934.14]  three or four and then a spinning kick to the head is like five oh right yeah yeah it's a lot and the
[5934.14 --> 5939.02]  reason for that is not because a spinning kick to the head is actually practical in a real world
[5939.02 --> 5948.38]  fight or flight i choose fight scenario but because it is slow and so it demonstrates a clear reading of
[5948.38 --> 5954.38]  where your opponent will be and a quickness in your execution that is uh desirable in this particular
[5954.38 --> 5960.14]  form of sparring we weren't fighting we were sparring so it's a points-based system yeah and a lot of it's
[5960.14 --> 5966.54]  like showing off technical ability and stuff more than uh uh being able to strike very hard or like
[5966.54 --> 5974.46]  knock your opponent out or we also played more like um like training or like uh like like kid or
[5974.46 --> 5981.02]  teenager rules in that we didn't allow like taekwondo mixed martial arts allows takedowns and allows
[5981.02 --> 5987.82]  strikes to the face but we played with takedowns but without strikes to the face yeah side and top of
[5987.82 --> 5993.10]  head were allowed i believe you can kick to the head but you were not allowed to strike with your
[5993.10 --> 6001.50]  hands okay to the head at all okay okay so what happened there were some definite like referee i
[6001.50 --> 6006.86]  wish the call had gone a different way moments uh there's there's this part where i clearly catch his
[6006.86 --> 6013.02]  leg and throw him on the ground and he gets two points for the kick for for the kick that never actually
[6013.02 --> 6019.58]  hit me that was a little frustrating uh i also okay dennis this is going to be a controversial take
[6019.58 --> 6027.82]  i don't think he deserved the points he got for that head kick that was not a kick even in the footage
[6027.82 --> 6037.90]  it looks like he like moved my head with his leg but if you go back and watch slowly i'm actually moving
[6037.90 --> 6046.62]  and his leg grazes my head i was gonna say because in person it seemed less legit than when i watched
[6046.62 --> 6052.38]  it in video and in video because the camera's on the other side of the room it seemed more legit i think
[6052.38 --> 6059.74]  i think dennis being the editor of the video might have picked the most favorable angle for that kick to
[6059.74 --> 6068.86]  the head um however that wasn't the biggest problem all right okay actually you know what i i'm talking
[6068.86 --> 6076.70]  about it a lot what did you think uh sorry once i have to send this message oh i'm asking about a
[6076.70 --> 6085.26]  technical thing um i was a little annoyed by a few things justin justin how it was the fight was very
[6085.26 --> 6090.06]  fun to watch the event was very entertaining yeah i had fun the video was very fun to watch
[6090.06 --> 6095.74]  something that is mentioned in the video like multiple times but was like painful in person
[6095.74 --> 6099.74]  like it was definitely covered in the video it was covered enough it didn't need to be covered more
[6100.54 --> 6107.42]  but the breaks between rounds were actually crazy like the breaks between rounds were longer than the
[6107.42 --> 6112.78]  rounds were um and i know linus actually defends dennis on this because linus is like i was tired too
[6112.78 --> 6119.34]  but like none of this made it into the video but there's i guarantee there's footage of me just like
[6119.34 --> 6125.74]  yelling at dennis to start fighting and i'm on dennis's side because and there's there's one part
[6125.74 --> 6132.94]  when the when the ref starts counting for him to like get up because or he'd be dq'd if he got to i
[6132.94 --> 6138.94]  think it was like 10 which is a long time to count for but he should have been he should have started
[6138.94 --> 6146.22]  that counting way earlier because he'd let him sit there for like oh maybe it was less than this it
[6146.22 --> 6153.90]  felt like 30 seconds like on the ground yeah like not like standing like sitting on the ground yeah
[6153.90 --> 6158.70]  and like this is this is not necessarily i might have said it wrong this is not time between rounds
[6158.70 --> 6164.06]  this was after a stoppage during a round where they're just resetting to go again because like
[6164.06 --> 6169.98]  someone went out of the circle or a point was scored or whatever um so dennis's cardio is even
[6169.98 --> 6178.62]  worse than it shows in the video by a lot a lot like you didn't you didn't see a huge portion of the
[6178.62 --> 6184.30]  stoppages where we're all just standing there waiting for dennis and then he comes out of those
[6184.30 --> 6190.38]  stoppages just flying all over the place tons of energy i had forgotten about this after he scored
[6190.38 --> 6195.18]  some point he does a cartwheel like he's totally into it and then there's a stoppage and he's like
[6195.18 --> 6203.02]  nope yeah pretty much which i mean with the amount of cardio that he has and how tired that he was
[6203.02 --> 6207.58]  the ability to pull it together and push through the tiredness and do some of the stuff that he did
[6208.14 --> 6214.30]  good one of the other things though yeah is that as he got tired and this happens as you get tired
[6214.30 --> 6219.26]  your hands start to kind of droop and any of your trainers are going to yell at you for them to come
[6219.26 --> 6226.62]  back up but uh he didn't exactly have a corner man so his hands are drooping hands are drooping
[6226.62 --> 6233.42]  hands are drooping hands are drooping and that's my biggest problem yeah is that a combination of
[6233.42 --> 6244.38]  dennis's tiredness and the format of the fight led to dennis basically fighting like this which again you
[6244.38 --> 6252.06]  can you can really only score points here here and here yeah back doesn't count right so if he's
[6252.06 --> 6260.78]  standing like this and the rules are that you have to get a clean hit i pretty much had nothing to
[6260.78 --> 6268.30]  strike at the only place is middle so i he he said what did he say coward move or something like that
[6268.30 --> 6273.26]  because i kept going for leg grabs and takedowns he was like yeah leg pulls are a coward move or something
[6273.26 --> 6279.26]  like something like that which is weird because you're volunteering to receive a strike but whatever
[6279.26 --> 6289.74]  um and and and he's but he was standing like this with his arms in front of his body when what i wanted
[6289.74 --> 6294.54]  to do was just punch him in the face then because his hands are down which is what a lot of people's
[6294.54 --> 6298.94]  reaction is going to be but that chicken move he called it a chicken move chicken move okay yeah yeah
[6298.94 --> 6303.90]  um but that that would be against the rules because you're not allowed to strike to the face so
[6303.90 --> 6310.94]  both of us just like the adrenaline was flowing and got demerits actually we lost points for striking
[6310.94 --> 6319.66]  the other one in the face at some point or another um with with our hands but i think that um i think that
[6319.66 --> 6327.18]  i could have maintained my guard a fair bit better and so so dennis actually already challenged me to a
[6327.18 --> 6334.70]  rematch and it needs to be way further out i have accepted oh 100 yeah 100 i would like i would like
[6334.70 --> 6340.46]  some time to to train a little bit i think that my cardio could be better i was tired i was tired too
[6340.46 --> 6344.54]  i didn't want to show it because the last thing you want to do is show your opponent you're tired
[6344.54 --> 6351.02]  but i was tired and i was in a lot of pain um me yeah yeah i i sustained a knee injury during the
[6351.02 --> 6357.02]  fight that was uh it's not dennis's fault he didn't do anything illegal or anything like that but i i
[6357.02 --> 6363.82]  grabbed his leg lifted his whole body weird like hopping jumping kick thing it was really odd yeah
[6363.82 --> 6368.78]  and then you happened to grab and pull and you kind of pulled because he was like off the ground when
[6368.78 --> 6374.46]  you pulled which was weird he kind of flew at you and then landed on your knee yeah so i was
[6374.46 --> 6379.98]  really tired and i was in a lot of pain um i want to get my knee like real good i want to get my
[6379.98 --> 6384.54]  cardio better and i want to get my flexibility better i was having a really hard time kicking high
[6385.18 --> 6391.26]  um he edited this out of the video but i was really tired that day and i was really sore i had played
[6391.26 --> 6397.42]  badminton the night before you should probably not do that next time two hours yeah and i had trained
[6398.94 --> 6403.50]  uh either the day before that or two days before that and i hadn't fully recovered when i played
[6403.50 --> 6409.82]  badminton that night so i was i was walking into the place and i didn't show it i didn't show it to
[6409.82 --> 6415.18]  dennis so i recorded all of this to other like camera operators so he would only see it when he
[6415.18 --> 6421.74]  was editing the footage but i was like like not sure if i was going to be able to kick it head level
[6421.74 --> 6426.94]  when i was going into it i think i think there should be rule changes if you guys fight again uh so
[6426.94 --> 6431.58]  that's that that's the thing i want some more time to work on my flexibility and here are the
[6431.58 --> 6437.58]  conditions of my rematch i want three minute rounds yeah we only did one minute rounds which is like
[6437.58 --> 6441.90]  three one minute rounds the fact that yeah the fact that he couldn't get through a one minute round
[6441.90 --> 6447.26]  was ridiculous and the first round was not one minute there's no way oh really the first round was
[6447.26 --> 6452.70]  way shorter oh i was just like i was just like it felt like the next two might have been longer than a
[6452.70 --> 6457.34]  minute so maybe it made up for it in the in the overall duration but the first round was really
[6457.34 --> 6464.46]  short i want delay of match penalties yes clearly set out and the timer needs to start like immediately
[6464.46 --> 6475.10]  yes clearly set out um and punching to the head and face is allowed you're okay with a broken nose
[6475.10 --> 6481.34]  i mean if it happens it happens he's not gonna hit me i'm just saying he's not gonna hit me only face uh
[6482.06 --> 6489.26]  only face yeah sorry what headshots only headshots only no no because then you just go like this
[6489.90 --> 6495.18]  and just kick yeah it just becomes like it's the same problem here's you have to have a reason
[6495.18 --> 6499.58]  to bring your hands down and you have to have a reason to bring your hands up otherwise there's
[6499.58 --> 6504.14]  nothing to strike at that's actually something i was going to mention maybe this gets solved with
[6504.14 --> 6510.70]  face punches being allowed but i was going to say if a kick gets blocked to the side by an arm that did
[6510.70 --> 6516.30]  not have to move in order to cause the block i think it should count as points oh i see what you
[6516.30 --> 6522.14]  mean no i don't think you'd be able to do that because you can keep your your like you can feel
[6522.14 --> 6527.18]  that they're probably not going for a high strike and you can keep your hands low like that's totally
[6527.18 --> 6534.62]  legit but you'd still move it like some of the blocks he literally does nothing i know yeah yeah i know
[6534.62 --> 6539.82]  i like it should be intentional and even if your arm is already low there's gonna be an intentional
[6539.82 --> 6544.06]  thing to try to block a kick and there's there's just nothing it just didn't count
[6545.26 --> 6551.50]  i don't know trevor w and float plane says i think i'm behind but holy those were only one minute
[6551.50 --> 6557.34]  round yeah like it was ridiculous to watch the the
[6557.34 --> 6565.58]  the the time not between rounds but during the round the time during the stoppages was longer than
[6565.58 --> 6573.42]  the round for i believe round two and three yeah probably like it was okay there are okay there there
[6573.42 --> 6578.78]  i'd be willing to be flexible if he wants to do two minute rounds i i could is like pretty long
[6578.78 --> 6582.70]  considering his cardio considering making that we're making a video too like we've got to
[6582.70 --> 6588.54]  show everything but not but also edit it you know like it's it's gonna end up pretty long would you
[6588.54 --> 6593.74]  guys be willing to stream it and set a date maybe yeah yeah i'd be down because like it should be an
[6593.74 --> 6600.38]  i think it should be an event i'd also be i would also be open to instead of like doing face strikes we
[6600.38 --> 6603.90]  could do side of the head and top of the head or something like that but you should be able to punch
[6604.46 --> 6610.70]  you must be able to get a point on the upper body with your hands because otherwise think about it
[6610.70 --> 6617.02]  what on earth can you do against someone who just comes at you like this and it's just like kick kick
[6617.02 --> 6621.10]  kick kick kick like there's nothing to do other than grab their leg and throw them on the ground
[6621.66 --> 6631.34]  yeah which is what he's doing yeah yeah so i i i played i played the game the way it had to be
[6631.34 --> 6638.94]  played but that was not the way i wanted to play it i wanted to in in dennis's uh defense with the list
[6638.94 --> 6644.62]  of rules that existed he played the game the way he should have done he did and he did really well
[6644.62 --> 6650.06]  he did all things considered no i i expected him to have about that level of cardio
[6652.70 --> 6659.02]  i did not expect him to be as proficient as he was yeah especially looking at um i watched on
[6659.02 --> 6663.02]  there's a float plane exclusive with some of his earlier fight training
[6663.02 --> 6669.02]  like he clearly had a lot of improvement over a relatively short that'll happen if you have
[6669.02 --> 6674.54]  training and you're remembering and you're exactly i just what just happened
[6676.94 --> 6683.58]  why did this start doing that i got it that's weird um but yeah i i was very impressed with dennis to be
[6683.58 --> 6691.42]  completely honest um yeah that's about it yeah he did well so that's my that's my conditions
[6691.42 --> 6696.38]  that's my conditions for the rematch someone said ltx you're gonna do it at ltx you know dennis
[6696.38 --> 6702.38]  actually suggested ltx and i said no because i thought there was just ltx is so busy there's so
[6702.38 --> 6708.22]  much going on yeah and the last thing i want is okay so let's say let's say my nose does get broken
[6708.22 --> 6712.70]  it would have to be the end or i aggravate my knee injury again yeah but we're both going to be
[6712.70 --> 6720.14]  exhausted from doing ltx especially me that's true that's true so like yeah yeah i get it but also
[6720.14 --> 6726.14]  yeah okay sorry something that someone else mentioned why okay by below the belt i don't
[6726.14 --> 6732.06]  mean crotch but why is there nothing below the belt um leg strikes are a thing yeah it's a thing but
[6732.06 --> 6738.06]  it's also a thing that is very likely to cause injury okay i mean i get it um the
[6738.06 --> 6745.34]  the the martial art that i trained did allow leg sweeps okay but only like a spinning leg sweep
[6745.34 --> 6750.38]  so it had it was kind of kind of like how you get a lot of points for a spinning head kick
[6751.18 --> 6758.06]  it's slow it's slow and and and and it makes you extremely vulnerable because if you go down
[6759.18 --> 6766.86]  sorry if you go down like this to put your leg out you're exposing the top of your head and
[6766.86 --> 6774.14]  uh we also allowed we allowed so in the in the training that i had in the the sport that i did
[6774.14 --> 6780.94]  uh our sparring allowed a back fist to the top of the head that was the way to make the head count
[6780.94 --> 6785.02]  for something uh you could do something like that too like it doesn't yes the the head points that
[6785.02 --> 6790.54]  we're trying to get is not because we want them to like get hurt just destroy each other's skulls
[6790.54 --> 6794.86]  you just need to be able to score points there so if the whole thing was back of fist
[6795.82 --> 6801.02]  instead of like direct contact that would be good like it just yeah i just had so many opportunities
[6801.02 --> 6805.74]  to punch him so i was like i needs to be i just wanted to there needs to be some way to make you
[6805.74 --> 6811.02]  think about where your arms are and incentivize needing to hold your arms up um yeah that like
[6811.02 --> 6818.94]  lans em asked uh was the fight was dennis cathartic um i think that's a great that is a good question
[6818.94 --> 6823.66]  that's a good question it was fun yeah it was fun it looked like other than the knee injury that you
[6823.66 --> 6829.74]  guys were like into it and enjoying it yeah yeah no i i actually i had a blast like i haven't done i
[6829.74 --> 6835.26]  haven't done this in 20 years like i and i would do like little tiny tournaments and stuff like i was
[6835.26 --> 6841.74]  a teenager right like you know kid level tournaments uh but i haven't i haven't sparred since then so yeah
[6841.74 --> 6846.94]  it was yeah it was fun i don't know someone mentioned luke and linus versus everyone else do you have any
[6846.94 --> 6851.82]  idea how many people work here now yes it'd be an army
[6854.54 --> 6860.30]  they could just dog pile on top of us and we wouldn't be able to move yeah and some of them are
[6860.30 --> 6868.22]  like quite large and proficient yeah like no yeah that would be that would be um probably not even that
[6868.22 --> 6874.94]  entertaining to watch hey have you seen the theme for the christmas party this year no it's pretty
[6874.94 --> 6881.58]  awesome if i do say so myself yvonne and i worked on it together full plane has like an idea for for
[6881.58 --> 6889.82]  our own sort of thing oh really yeah um so this is it uh everyone gets uh there are i believe yeah
[6889.82 --> 6899.98]  there are 10 tables slash teams uh and because it is our 10 year anniversary every team gets a theme that
[6899.98 --> 6907.82]  is one of the anniversary materials okay so the teams are paper cotton leather fruit slash flowers
[6907.82 --> 6918.78]  wood candy slash iron wool slash copper bronze willow slash pottery and tin slash aluminum so you will be
[6918.78 --> 6928.14]  as as usual uh asked to coordinate with your team to represent your theme and as usual you don't have to
[6928.14 --> 6930.78]  participate but everybody does
[6933.82 --> 6939.18]  dan you've done a christmas party now right that's right just the one right yeah okay okay okay and
[6939.18 --> 6943.42]  would you recommend participating at the christmas party fun is mandatory
[6946.54 --> 6951.74]  oh yeah no you gotta you should it's it's part of it it's good it's you gotta go nuts it's a hoot
[6951.74 --> 6956.86]  yeah uh gabriel says you guys always talk about them but vaguely yeah the reason for that is that
[6956.86 --> 6963.90]  it's an internal thing yeah we like to yeah we like to um or i i i i don't know i guess i've never
[6963.90 --> 6971.26]  really asked anyone about it but i want to maintain some uh separation like this is not about this is
[6971.26 --> 6977.02]  not this is part of our thing we're not putting on a performance this is not about public relations this
[6977.02 --> 6984.46]  is not about anything this is a chance for us to have fun with each other and make it not about
[6984.46 --> 6992.62]  making videos for for once you know like everything else we do is like oh but it's content you know is
[6992.62 --> 7001.10]  it content what's the content no no oh my god no content just christmas party you know so um that's
[7001.10 --> 7009.34]  that's why it's it's it's not something that we have contentized yeah yeah it's fun though it's
[7009.34 --> 7015.58]  that's cool though that makes sense for a theme yeah that's cool i'm excited yeah 10 years it's been
[7015.58 --> 7024.38]  a long time 10 years yeah it's wild i was thinking the other day i think it's 12 for us or something
[7024.38 --> 7030.30]  yeah yeah it's just ridiculous it's creeping on half the amount of time we've been alive i know right
[7030.30 --> 7034.86]  it'll get there eventually maybe yeah i think ivan and i crossed that threshold very recently yeah
[7034.86 --> 7040.30]  we've been an interesting one together for half of our alive time and when you consider how little
[7040.30 --> 7047.50]  you remember of the beginning of your alive time like our actual like like part that we know of
[7047.50 --> 7054.30]  it's like most of it it's like what did you know what was life like when and i yeah you know didn't
[7054.30 --> 7058.78]  have you there i don't i don't know anymore yeah it's wild it's interesting
[7058.78 --> 7067.58]  fly a fan out for the christmas party no it's literally the point is to not do that
[7068.78 --> 7074.78]  it's really nice having like the day to just not be on if you don't want to be like the only day it
[7074.78 --> 7080.62]  is there's it's yeah having a super private is super nice yeah it's good yeah it's our thing yeah
[7081.26 --> 7087.26]  deal with it uh should we do some merch messages i think that's it for the main topics but we have a
[7087.26 --> 7091.18]  ton of merch messages to talk to you guys about i have a lot that are potential you can have a look
[7091.18 --> 7095.26]  at those if you're fans i can start going through those yeah for sure all of them are just reliance
[7095.26 --> 7101.82]  anyways want to read us some uh curated ones hit me sure uh let's see ben asks hello linus with the
[7101.82 --> 7107.74]  rise of power consumption of computers i have hit an issue in the usa where i cannot run four computers
[7107.74 --> 7113.50]  on the same room do you have any suggestions for people who are stuck with a 15 amp breaker currently i have
[7113.50 --> 7121.74]  to run an extension cord uh also run the gpu for plex that is a spectacularly first world problem just
[7122.30 --> 7130.70]  saying um so you know good for you having four computers no no i don't have another solution i mean
[7130.70 --> 7138.46]  there's i could suggest stuff that might be like super illegal like you could you could at your breaker
[7138.46 --> 7146.06]  um combine that circuit and run it at 240 volt that would give you that would give you some more
[7146.54 --> 7152.38]  that would give you some more power that's like really stupid though don't do that because you could
[7152.38 --> 7157.18]  just like fry other things that you plug into those outlets would be pretty sweet because like a computer
[7157.18 --> 7162.78]  around 240 volt because switching modern switching power supplies and all that um so yeah you could do
[7162.78 --> 7171.18]  that don't do that um you could uh let's see man you could oh you could buy all new computers that are
[7171.18 --> 7179.58]  more efficient don't don't do that that's stupid yeah um you could have an electrician come in and install
[7180.22 --> 7186.70]  new wiring with new circuits in part of the room uh that's expensive i'm sure you thought of that and
[7186.70 --> 7193.02]  that's a bad solution or or you could run an extension cord which is what you're doing now
[7193.02 --> 7197.98]  okay in all seriousness though there may actually be nearby circuits that you could tap into so if
[7197.98 --> 7204.54]  there's a if there's a room on the other side of the wall for example again this might not be to code
[7204.54 --> 7210.62]  either but you could probably find an electrician buddy who might be willing to do it and it wouldn't
[7210.62 --> 7218.30]  be dangerous to take that outlet open up the wall on both sides turn it around patch up the wall and
[7218.30 --> 7222.54]  then you'd at least have one outlet in the room that was on a circuit that was like intended for
[7222.54 --> 7227.74]  another room so it's probably probably on a separate circuit um and that would be yeah that would be the
[7227.74 --> 7233.90]  way that i would probably say is the safest most legit way to do that
[7233.90 --> 7251.10]  it was a weird gift from my parents yeah yeah i don't know what happened to that jacket
[7252.14 --> 7258.70]  jacket i i'd have no idea either and i definitely don't have it it's not me um but that jacket got
[7258.70 --> 7265.18]  worn by like everyone yeah at some point or another we were quite cold in the garage at the
[7265.18 --> 7275.66]  beginning of the company we had a community jacket yeah we've come pretty far sorry floodplain whoops
[7276.62 --> 7283.90]  what uh my mic was muted oh yeah i'm out of practice oh they asked about the the old like
[7283.90 --> 7291.50]  mil spec jacket i used to wear with like um uh with camo on it yeah no no no no what was oh people
[7291.50 --> 7297.18]  asking what was the question uh the question do you want to say it again yeah uh linus used to wear a cad
[7297.18 --> 7303.26]  pad parka um matthew was wondering if he was in the armed forces or just perpetually cold
[7304.46 --> 7312.94]  cad pad is in canadian pattern canadian camouflage oh okay i believe i'm pretty sure cad c-a-d-p-a-t right cad pat
[7313.90 --> 7323.34]  yes pat yeah yes next one uh sure this is from anonymous hi linus do you have any plans to make
[7323.34 --> 7328.14]  a video about the massive backpack shipment coming in and how the creator warehouse is turning that
[7328.14 --> 7335.10]  around um they would be interested to see how you master such a logistical challenge i don't uh the
[7335.10 --> 7343.42]  creator warehouse warehouse is actually run by the former logistics manager for ncix and as far as i can
[7343.42 --> 7348.94]  tell half of what he does is black magic i don't understand it so i can't be involved in everything
[7348.94 --> 7353.42]  and if it's running smoothly and they do ship a lot of orders per day like when they have the stuff in
[7353.42 --> 7367.10]  stock it goes uh i i don't ask questions i good you know thanks uh josh ms been a while since i've been
[7367.10 --> 7373.58]  able to watch the show live when doing your smart home stuff was uh savant ever thought i'm an
[7373.58 --> 7380.06]  installer for them and while highly proprietary they seem to be leading the market did you uh did you
[7380.06 --> 7385.10]  like consider a bunch of different stuff or were you just sent things to put in your walls kind of
[7385.10 --> 7390.54]  no i i did consider a lot of different stuff no savant is not something that i looked into i mean that's
[7390.54 --> 7398.70]  the issue though is there's like a lot so it's shocking like you look at how many weird proprietary
[7398.70 --> 7405.98]  closed ecosystems there are for smart home stuff and how many people do you know that have smart
[7405.98 --> 7412.54]  anything in their houses and you kind of go everything i know about minimum order quantities
[7412.54 --> 7418.86]  for products and how much it costs to engineer a product and the math just doesn't make sense i i've
[7418.86 --> 7422.14]  thought about this before i have a weird theory on it i could be just completely out to lunch but
[7422.14 --> 7429.58]  you know how the thing where like every vegas hotel the the company that owns the hotel also
[7429.58 --> 7434.70]  owns the companies that supply all the clocks and the sheets and the cleaning supplies and the deodorant
[7434.70 --> 7439.50]  or not deodorant but soap and all that kind of stuff i feel like it's a similar thing i feel like
[7439.50 --> 7445.02]  contractor construction companies that are building like high rises that have hodom automation and stuff spin
[7445.02 --> 7451.18]  up these things i don't know i honestly don't know but i don't understand how the math works yeah
[7451.18 --> 7456.22]  because it's it's crazy there's so many of these companies yeah and i know very few people that have
[7456.22 --> 7462.06]  anything installed at all and usually when they do it's very simple it doesn't have like just switches
[7462.06 --> 7468.22]  everywhere yeah i don't get it yeah you pay extra to not have it be smart yeah yeah yeah tvs
[7469.18 --> 7474.78]  okay let's move on here we got another one from anonymous question for luke about the yard podcast who is
[7474.78 --> 7479.34]  your favorite member and or favorite guest they have had on the show i have no idea what this is
[7479.34 --> 7485.82]  wow um i didn't think we'd have a question about another podcast on our podcast um we're getting
[7485.82 --> 7492.78]  a podcast we're getting pretty meta uh i like slime he's he's how i found the show and i find him
[7492.78 --> 7496.62]  entertaining they're all really good though they're entertaining i like slime too it's like goopy
[7496.62 --> 7505.42]  slime likes you oh well that just got really awkward it's a hangout on a barn sometime or
[7505.42 --> 7510.78]  something don't worry about it a barn yeah don't worry about it it's fine okay next question cool hey
[7510.78 --> 7519.90]  sure is this a person yeah i hope so don't worry about it do you think usb could ever get in the uh get to
[7519.90 --> 7526.14]  the point where it would be the standard used to connect all components inside a pc no yeah this is
[7526.14 --> 7533.26]  like an xkd xkcd thing you know another standard it's just not made for that yeah it's uh it's what's
[7533.26 --> 7540.14]  great about usb is it's hot pluggable and it's like super backwards and forwards compatible but that's not
[7540.14 --> 7550.14]  necessarily what you want for plugging in uh uh an rgb header on your uh you know light strip so no
[7550.14 --> 7553.98]  it's it's never going to be everything yeah there's different standards for different things right
[7555.42 --> 7560.38]  uh tommy w asks hi linus do you have any advice on building a team for a small startup
[7561.82 --> 7567.34]  i feel like i'm the wrong person to ask because my hiring strategy was to just hire people i liked
[7567.34 --> 7577.66]  and then hire people that they knew honestly like i i i do know how to hire but i'm not methodical
[7577.66 --> 7583.98]  about it i'm i'm kind of scattershot i'll ask weird questions during an interview and like if i get a
[7583.98 --> 7592.78]  good vibe then i'll go for it you know i i there's there's really way more structured ways to do hr that i i
[7592.78 --> 7599.66]  just i haven't studied i haven't practiced i i'm not qualified to give advice on i mean i i can say
[7599.66 --> 7607.74]  that you want to pick a team that you are okay being stuck in a small room with eight hours a day
[7608.54 --> 7615.18]  five days a week at minimum right that that is actually really important so i was good at that part
[7615.18 --> 7622.62]  but there's a lot of uh there's a lot of stuff that i'm not that great at aj points out in chat i
[7622.62 --> 7631.58]  barely had an interview yeah that's true yeah like what do we know i do a lot i do a lot now but i
[7631.58 --> 7638.70]  don't think we count as a startup anymore so yeah alex b asked getting a screwdriver today and saving for
[7638.70 --> 7644.62]  the backpack which two fantastic launches in the last couple of months which product are you most proud
[7644.62 --> 7649.66]  of the screwdriver or the backpack that's like asking me which is which of my children i love
[7649.66 --> 7659.58]  more my son or luke um there's no way there's no way i'm gonna pick one i i i love both of them equally
[7660.14 --> 7668.46]  uh they were both a ton of work um i hope to have many years with both of them
[7670.38 --> 7674.54]  am i talking about luke and my son am i talking about the screwdriver and the backpack we don't
[7674.54 --> 7680.38]  know okay which one of your kids had a bitter upbringing then was the screwdriver easier to
[7680.38 --> 7687.02]  raise or was the backpack easier to raise well the screwdriver has was real challenging uh pre-birth
[7687.58 --> 7696.78]  but the backpack is proving itself to be a bit of a a post-birth um uh a difficult one to deal with so
[7696.78 --> 7703.66]  yeah yeah difficult child difficult child yeah all right uh wayne asks uh other than usb cables
[7703.66 --> 7710.54]  ltt is planning to make what other cables would you like to make hdmi displayport cat5e cat6 coaxial
[7710.54 --> 7715.34]  for i don't think we're gonna get into i don't think we're gonna get into network cables that's just
[7715.34 --> 7723.42]  such a that's that's that's a deep deep deep rabbit hole i could absolutely see us doing hdmi displayport
[7723.42 --> 7731.42]  coax i think is pretty unlikely but it it kind of depends on how usb and display cables go i think
[7731.42 --> 7736.06]  our ideal world would be that with our cable management product plus our cables you'd have
[7736.06 --> 7742.06]  everything you need for your pc setup i think usb and display is probably enough to be completely
[7742.06 --> 7748.38]  power we could do power i want sdi cables i can't find one on the market that works for me oh really
[7748.38 --> 7754.70]  well what's your problem they're not flexible or 4k enough oh okay so you want them to be both flexible
[7754.70 --> 7762.46]  and 4k yeah it's not like a coaxial stable that is good for a long-term camera use right oh i mean
[7762.46 --> 7768.70]  yeah we could look into it i think we were and it was just extremely expensive yeah oh well yeah well
[7768.70 --> 7775.66]  there's your problem that makes sense uh okay moving on let's see we've got uh one from michael here
[7775.66 --> 7782.70]  do you have another recommendation other than the ring i don't want to say it wrong now i'm scared
[7782.70 --> 7787.74]  uh have you tried circular i haven't uh i don't have another recommendation like that's the that's
[7787.74 --> 7791.66]  the really frustrating thing about this is aside from them being really difficult to deal with i
[7791.66 --> 7799.90]  really like the product yeah yeah sorry um and like for me honestly the whole health tracking thing is
[7799.90 --> 7808.06]  very take it or leave it i i have been i've been blessed i've been very lucky to not really have to worry
[7808.06 --> 7814.86]  about tracking my blood oxygen level or or anything like that like i i just kind of i eat when i'm
[7814.86 --> 7822.78]  hungry i i sort of move around more when i feel like i'm getting a spare tire i just i kind of do what
[7822.78 --> 7828.30]  my body tells me to do uh so i don't need a ring to tell me to do any of that um but i just i just kind
[7828.30 --> 7833.26]  of liked it it was just kind of numbers for geeks for me so i'm probably not going to go actively
[7833.26 --> 7837.34]  pursuing an alternative to it because the only reason i ever used it in the first place was
[7837.34 --> 7841.42]  because they sent me one for free and i figured i had better try this if we're going to do a
[7841.42 --> 7846.78]  sponsored video on it and it's like a health product so i probably just won't do anything i
[7846.78 --> 7851.82]  mean same sort of vein you're not wearing your watch today no i forgot to put on my watch this morning
[7852.22 --> 7858.46]  i do have that withings um scan watch and it's like cool i guess because i kind of have like a reverse
[7858.46 --> 7865.02]  merch message now oh you do your your watch that you're wearing now like isn't a pebble uh
[7866.14 --> 7871.74]  and so shank would like to ask you why you're not wearing the pebble that he uh this is the problem
[7871.74 --> 7878.22]  with gifts but it's also there oh you got it on the backpack that's awesome i just wanted a friendly
[7878.22 --> 7885.50]  rib you about it i will i will daily drive it again i will give it i will give it a shot i will give
[7885.50 --> 7891.90]  it a shot but i appreciate the gift and for me it's more about like remembering the pebble
[7892.54 --> 7896.22]  uh the the one good smart watch i ever owned the pebble time
[7898.22 --> 7904.30]  great i'd be happy to hear that uh another one from anonymous would lmg ever consider absorbing a
[7904.30 --> 7909.74]  content creator assuming it was a mutually beneficial um the brand didn't tread on existing content that
[7909.74 --> 7920.46]  sort of thing um we sort of have really with horst right no no he was working for like um he was
[7920.46 --> 7926.06]  doing like local like community video for a big company i guess he's not yeah it wasn't his channel
[7926.06 --> 7932.38]  yeah no no well he is now wasn't yeah yeah yeah yeah um what do you think what should we do
[7932.38 --> 7939.66]  should we go on a big like acquisition spree i think in a lot of channels situations it isn't the
[7939.66 --> 7946.70]  right move um i think if it was the right move that we would do it i know we've technically tried
[7946.70 --> 7955.10]  in the past um and then it was decided mutually that it wasn't the right move yeah i mean it can be the
[7955.10 --> 7960.70]  right move i ran into both mythical and smosh down at creator summit and they both seem okay to be doing
[7960.70 --> 7967.34]  great yeah sounds good but i think those situations will be rare and they found one which is fantastic
[7967.34 --> 7975.50]  um but yeah situations are rare never say never but i i mean i don't um a big part of what makes a
[7975.50 --> 7984.46]  youtube channel work is the team that has made it work and so i i feel like unless you're acquiring the
[7984.46 --> 7989.82]  talent um you better have a really solid plan for how you're going to maintain the soul
[7990.46 --> 7994.94]  of that media property because it isn't just a media property but then there are exceptions
[7994.94 --> 8001.90]  now that the business is uh is maturing you're seeing some channels that really were started just
[8001.90 --> 8008.86]  as business endeavors and are structured more like traditional media companies and so yeah there could
[8008.86 --> 8014.46]  be situations where it might make sense with that said i think our expertise is building youtube channels
[8014.46 --> 8024.30]  and brands so in there will always be the question every time of could we just build it ourselves and
[8024.30 --> 8033.42]  if we could then should we do that instead and if we can't then is this such a unicorn that we can like
[8033.42 --> 8038.46]  can we even afford something that's so amazing that we couldn't have done it and so the answer to
[8038.46 --> 8043.58]  those the answer the answer to the questions have to be yes i can afford it and no we couldn't build it
[8045.02 --> 8050.38]  that seems like a a small overlapping venn diagram circle you know
[8050.38 --> 8061.02]  okay we got a special message here from jeff um wanted to give a happy birthday to his wife sarah blankenship
[8061.02 --> 8068.78]  um she's uh one of the rare and amazing human females that love ldt the entire crew including myself
[8068.78 --> 8074.54]  apparently um and uh yeah i just wanted if uh you guys could wish her a happy birthday yeah happy birthday
[8074.54 --> 8082.70]  so that's always a fun one uh another one from samuel uh what is the reasoning why igpus are not
[8082.70 --> 8088.46]  benchmarked during cpu reviews when you talk about ultra budget computers using an igpu can be a good idea
[8088.46 --> 8093.18]  but it's hard to tell which ones are good or not yeah it's a good question i would say that with ryzen
[8093.18 --> 8098.46]  7000 the reason we didn't really talk about it was because if you're spending that kind of money on a cpu
[8098.46 --> 8105.10]  the igpu is a co-processor it's for uh you know hardware video encoding or something like that it's
[8105.10 --> 8111.02]  for whatever features you might take advantage of on that igpu i don't realistically expect you to
[8111.02 --> 8120.30]  game on it in the longer term because you just bought ddr5 memory a 250 to 500 motherboard
[8120.30 --> 8127.02]  and like a 300 plus dollar cpu like what are you doing if you're if you're spend if you're spending
[8127.02 --> 8133.02]  that kind of money and you don't have a graphics card you did it wrong you didn't build a balanced
[8133.02 --> 8139.66]  machine so from my point of view it's kind of irrelevant in the context of that product but if
[8139.66 --> 8146.54]  we were reviewing something that is like you know a hundred thirty nine dollar chip that could very
[8146.54 --> 8151.18]  well go in a fifty dollar board and use onboard graphics for an extended period of time then it would
[8151.18 --> 8153.34]  absolutely be something that we would look at more closely
[8153.34 --> 8160.94]  okay got another one here from anonymous do you think google is simply not interested in maintaining
[8160.94 --> 8166.86]  a product that doesn't print money and have billions of users the way search android and youtube do
[8166.86 --> 8171.42]  well yeah i mean you see that in any large company right like there's the whole uh innovators
[8171.42 --> 8177.50]  dilemma thing where it's really really hard as an established company to start up new business
[8177.50 --> 8183.98]  endeavors because they are inherently not worth the time and attention that they require so that's why
[8183.98 --> 8190.14]  acquisitions are so common for as companies get larger and larger and larger because it doesn't you
[8190.14 --> 8195.58]  can't never innovate because then eventually someone will come and eat your lunch and you can't innovate
[8195.58 --> 8203.26]  because it's a waste of time and money to innovate you know what i mean so yeah obviously they're they're
[8203.26 --> 8209.58]  looking for the next big home run right because nothing else is even going to register it's like a
[8209.58 --> 8217.18]  million dollar business to us right like a million dollar product idea to us so that's you talk in terms of
[8217.18 --> 8223.50]  like yearly revenue that's a big deal right million dollars is a lot of money to google
[8225.58 --> 8232.94]  rounding error irrelevant right so they're operating at this just completely utterly different scale right
[8233.26 --> 8239.82]  um and and honestly i'd like i don't have the background to really speak to the kinds of
[8239.82 --> 8244.30]  decision making processes that a company like that would go through at that scale yeah yeah i don't get
[8244.30 --> 8249.90]  it some of the stuff is just bizarre though yeah for sure what is it like meat and other more different
[8249.90 --> 8258.22]  meat meat new and like how that went through is astonishing like i just and meanwhile the meat teams
[8258.22 --> 8266.38]  you know watching project cancellations are looking at it going which meat uh yeah yep i just want them
[8266.38 --> 8271.26]  to build one final video conferencing platform called beyond meat
[8273.34 --> 8278.70]  know how i timed it for when he was drinking that was on purpose almost got him
[8278.70 --> 8287.02]  he's followed it he got it he didn't spin it all over the laptop it's his laptop too
[8287.82 --> 8296.14]  jeez oh man this one's from richard you have the best 4k hdr tvs sound systems and pc hardware do you
[8296.14 --> 8303.02]  think having access to the best tech for so long has skewed your idea of what an average person wants
[8303.02 --> 8309.66]  in terms of tech uh your viewers are the techier crowd but i bet most people won't notice fps past 128
[8309.66 --> 8321.82]  hertz i think it's a temporal problem right so yes um i have cool stuff and whatever and so does that
[8321.82 --> 8328.22]  does that change what people might want or might aspire to or does that that change my perception of
[8328.22 --> 8333.66]  what people might want or aspire to um no i don't think so i think it just means that i'm there a
[8333.66 --> 8341.10]  little bit earlier right like we've seen this throughout the entire existence of modern electronics and
[8341.10 --> 8349.74]  technologies that when it comes it comes for a select few whether it starts out in the enterprise or starts
[8349.74 --> 8355.18]  out as a like okay smartphones are a perfect example it starts out as this niche thing for the uber wealthy
[8355.18 --> 8361.98]  like um i forget who it is someone here uh knows someone i think it might be james who knows like
[8361.98 --> 8369.26]  intimately knows a um like a home automation installer and he was telling me about the kind of stuff that
[8369.26 --> 8377.50]  that like the the uber wealthy have in their homes like we're talking motorized tv mounts where it like
[8377.50 --> 8383.90]  goes back and hides in a in a completely invisible wall panel and then it comes out and angles out this way so
[8383.90 --> 8389.10]  that they can watch tv while they're in the kitchen and it's like specifically for that or like subwoofers
[8389.10 --> 8394.70]  that are under the ground so that they are won't be visible and they actually shake the ground by the
[8394.70 --> 8401.18]  pool side so you can like really get into your party vibe or like whatever it is this stuff exists now
[8401.98 --> 8410.94]  has existed for 10 or 20 years right but you don't have it you don't even aspire to it and yet
[8410.94 --> 8418.78]  even wall mounting a tv was unheard of 10 15 years ago that wasn't mainstream right yeah well i think
[8418.78 --> 8424.62]  now it's just normal well yeah you just wall mount your tv i i think it's almost irrelevant and that might
[8424.62 --> 8432.14]  be surprising but what i would say is that as long as you try to keep yourself true to explaining how
[8432.78 --> 8438.62]  good or cool something is and you point out the price points sure that's for the other people to
[8438.62 --> 8447.90]  decide but the my point is that the price point will come so what ltt has really always been is really
[8447.90 --> 8457.90]  cool cutting edge stuff and that might not be today for everybody but it will come eventually no matter what
[8457.90 --> 8465.02]  game it is no matter what you know rip in tier fast cpu or gpu it is someday it will be cheap
[8465.82 --> 8472.78]  every experience will eventually come and so i think that we do get a lot of criticism for not
[8472.78 --> 8477.42]  talking about low-end hardware and i think a big part of that has been that i've never been a fan of
[8477.42 --> 8484.94]  low-end hardware i want high-end hardware i'll take used high-end hardware absolutely i totally understand
[8484.94 --> 8490.62]  not everybody has the budget for brand new high-end hardware been there but that doesn't mean you
[8490.62 --> 8497.66]  shouldn't buy good stuff don't buy bad stuff and that also doesn't mean that you should get the
[8497.66 --> 8503.66]  highest-end stuff either like there's there's a there's a sweet spot it's all about the sweet spot
[8503.66 --> 8512.14]  i guess that's what i'm trying to say yeah so yeah i i do think there are things a lot of people won't
[8512.14 --> 8519.98]  notice but i also think that it's sort of my job to figure out what you will notice and what you
[8519.98 --> 8526.46]  should direct your resources toward uh like so up to the to the crowd to decide if they will notice it
[8526.46 --> 8532.70]  or not like the example you gave of noticing fps past 120 hertz okay so first of all fps and refresh
[8532.70 --> 8539.02]  rate are not equivalent there are benefits to higher frame rates other than just making sure that you've
[8539.02 --> 8544.22]  got whatever matches your monitor because it decreases the latency of your of your inputs
[8544.22 --> 8551.90]  right so um yes most people won't notice a refresh rate with an appropriately high frame rate past
[8551.90 --> 8558.54]  about 120 hertz but we've made that video and we've also made videos where we talk about these higher
[8558.54 --> 8564.06]  refresh rates monitors and how they they do feel smoother and they do feel better and if you could have
[8564.06 --> 8569.82]  one for a reasonable price or for a small uplift over one that isn't uber high refresh rate well
[8569.82 --> 8576.30]  then you might as well go for it it's just a matter of when that is going to intersect with so that
[8576.30 --> 8582.30]  you've got like the desirability of it and the cost of it where do those lines meet for you right it's it's
[8582.30 --> 8586.86]  all personal all we can talk about is what it is and it's up to you to determine if it has a value for you
[8586.86 --> 8594.62]  okay i got another one here from emmanuel uh hey linus has inflation and the current negative market
[8594.62 --> 8601.42]  affected ltt in any way also happy to get my fire uh hand happy to finally get my hands on one of the
[8601.42 --> 8607.26]  ltd screwdrivers um has it gotten easier to hire devs
[8611.02 --> 8616.78]  hiring devs is still a nightmare um we're also in vancouver yeah which doesn't help yeah so like
[8616.78 --> 8621.50]  not really to be honest because i i mean we haven't had any layoffs or anything like that
[8621.50 --> 8629.74]  but there's been a lot industry layoffs so like i've yeah like we're not by the way we're fine um
[8630.62 --> 8638.06]  i've had a lot of people late applying like the post is still up on the website because we're like
[8638.06 --> 8643.98]  kind of still interested in collecting resumes but i'll see this is actually kind of interesting i'll see
[8643.98 --> 8649.98]  like so and so company lays off like some huge percentage of their workforce and then our resume
[8649.98 --> 8659.34]  intake goes like right yeah and it's okay interesting um but it hasn't become easier any impact on us would
[8659.34 --> 8665.02]  be from external sources we are pretty well diversified now and a big part of that hey thanks for buying that
[8665.02 --> 8672.70]  screwdriver is you guys so much of our funding comes directly from our community that it would be very
[8672.70 --> 8680.06]  difficult for us to reach a position where we could be we could be crippled by economic conditions that
[8680.06 --> 8687.50]  are outside of our control um we we might see some advertising pullback um i don't know that it's been
[8687.50 --> 8693.82]  significant yet but we we could see something like that uh we might see adsense dip i i don't know but
[8693.82 --> 8700.46]  you know okay let's say they fall by 30 each or something like that we'd still we'd still survive we're
[8700.46 --> 8710.14]  good we're built to last okay from richard on the subject of companies killing services slash products
[8710.14 --> 8717.98]  is there anything you wish stuck around i mesh nexus devices what on earth is a nexus device that's what
[8717.98 --> 8725.34]  pixels yeah oh yes of course yes yeah it was like i think i had cheap crap crappy android phones and
[8725.34 --> 8729.98]  tablets except they weren't that crappy because google was subsidizing them they were awesome yeah
[8730.78 --> 8735.82]  they were like but they were priced like cheap crappy google that's dangerous to do great yeah
[8735.82 --> 8743.50]  they were kind of great um yeah i mean nexus device definitely a good one uh i wish i wish oculus was
[8743.50 --> 8750.30]  still oculus that would have been cool oh you're gonna make me cry um that one that one hurts a lot
[8750.30 --> 8755.18]  actually yeah right through the heart you know what dk1 i always been there from the start you know
[8755.18 --> 8762.70]  what yeah i missed dfi man they're like land party motherboards with the uv reactive slots and stuff
[8762.70 --> 8768.54]  they were like there was a short period there where they were like just the shiz when it came to
[8768.54 --> 8777.18]  overclocking and and all that i'm sad that case labs is donezo because i never made enough money to ever
[8777.18 --> 8783.18]  afford a case labs case yeah so i never got to experience it and now they're gone and that's just
[8783.18 --> 8793.34]  sad um but for me i mean you did make enough money at some point to afford one but you got free computers
[8793.34 --> 8798.06]  by then not really when they were alive what not in not in shut down to like two years ago what are you
[8798.06 --> 8803.74]  talking about that was more than two years shut up no really was it not i thought it was closer to like
[8803.74 --> 8812.86]  four august 2018 oh four years you could have afforded a case labs case four years ago stop
[8812.86 --> 8819.50]  not on my metrics shut up everyone's version of affordability is nothing but chicken breast
[8819.50 --> 8825.74]  chicken breast is expensive right now dude it wasn't grocery bills are going it wasn't four years ago
[8825.74 --> 8830.06]  i mean don't move the goal posts they're just giving away budgies in the park he's moving
[8834.86 --> 8839.42]  nobody wants you to know this but the budgies in the park are free i have dozens of them
[8840.38 --> 8843.18]  your food mill's gone to nothing you can just take them
[8846.06 --> 8848.86]  that's a good that's a good reference i'm so sorry um
[8848.86 --> 8853.98]  um are we even talking about yeah yeah what were we talking about we're talking about that you are
[8853.98 --> 8859.90]  the biggest cheapskate ever yeah pretty much you could have afforded a case labs case just fine
[8859.90 --> 8862.14]  it would not it would not have been wise at that time
[8865.42 --> 8872.70]  it wouldn't have i was saving to buy a place and stuff okay yeah so anything is unaffordable yes if
[8872.70 --> 8881.50]  you're if your bar is literally that i am now not spending a dollar so candy bars i if only i could
[8881.50 --> 8887.18]  white premium if only i could have had a kit kat bar before that yeah well you could have you just
[8887.90 --> 8894.22]  like it's a want though it's not a need oh my god it's very pragmatic my case was fine i'm with luke
[8894.22 --> 8900.70]  on this yeah all right let's move on uh james says as a bike rider on the next backpack could you
[8900.70 --> 8906.30]  add reflective panels for increased visibility you know we wanted to do um we wanted this one
[8906.30 --> 8912.78]  to be reflective down here at the very least i forget why we didn't do it uh i think it was
[8912.78 --> 8918.78]  like a durability concern because the reflective materials were not particularly durable and we
[8918.78 --> 8923.18]  figured that the solution to that would be that if you really wanted reflective stuff on it you can
[8923.18 --> 8927.98]  get like reflective iron on patches and you could just put them on i i know it's not a perfect answer
[8927.98 --> 8932.30]  but that's the answer here's a suggestion that'll probably be a no but i know there's been talk
[8932.30 --> 8938.86]  about a rain cover uh we are working on it what about a reflective one that's not a bad idea but i
[8938.86 --> 8943.26]  i mean yeah the rain cover okay well hold on hold on i don't want to commit to anything because
[8943.26 --> 8947.26]  the rain cover first and foremost needs to be waterproof and if the reflectiveness will cost
[8947.26 --> 8952.14]  us anything in terms of waterproofness i don't want to i don't want a water resistant ish
[8952.14 --> 8957.82]  rain cover i want it to actually stop water from getting into the bag did you say waterproof and
[8958.70 --> 8965.98]  nothing is waterproof nothing is ever waterproof but i want it to be as water resistant as possible
[8965.98 --> 8970.94]  rain should not be a problem and yeah that would be that would be the goal that would be the goal
[8972.86 --> 8973.10]  okay
[8975.74 --> 8981.74]  uh hey team uh fyi i couldn't post a merch message on your android while logged in but i can as a guest
[8981.74 --> 8987.50]  the live section didn't come up uh would you guys try compressors on your mics when you're quiet
[8988.14 --> 8995.66]  oh i think why is this a curated one for me the main concern is that um i get too loud so i don't
[8995.66 --> 9000.38]  know if our compressor is actually tuned for when i'm too quiet i don't remember curating this one i'm
[9000.38 --> 9007.34]  sorry you did okay yeah so we actually do have a compression straight uh compression stage in our uh
[9007.34 --> 9013.42]  audio chain uh we have both a hardware compressor and then also a software compressor uh the idea is
[9013.42 --> 9019.50]  i want to maintain linus and luke's dynamic range uh with being able to prevent any sort of digital
[9019.50 --> 9026.70]  clipping uh or even analog clipping from from that stage there um it's difficult to keep these guys in
[9026.70 --> 9035.90]  check um the mic position is not always right you've got uh different levels of excitement you know and
[9035.90 --> 9041.02]  it's it's not a perfect room either so we're going to pick up any background noise from our ac and
[9041.02 --> 9045.90]  that sort of thing if listen to this guy blaming everyone but himself for our audio challenges yeah
[9045.90 --> 9051.10]  well i'm thinking i'm thinking after today you know i was fixing some of those wrinkles i was looking at
[9051.10 --> 9059.34]  this setup here this just needs to go we need something else i'm gonna fix this place and no more goxlr's
[9059.34 --> 9066.46]  are gonna be mentioned this is gonna really this is gonna be the best podcast set live streaming set
[9067.26 --> 9076.78]  you heard it here i swear on linus's uh life son i don't get it wow get it yeah get it okay
[9078.62 --> 9083.98]  i'm gonna make this good that camera's not on anymore but that was very good if you guys could have seen
[9083.98 --> 9089.50]  that he was very enthusiastically pointing at the camera um i just want it to be easy for everybody
[9089.50 --> 9094.86]  and not terrible and sound better anyway yes i use two types of compressor and i'm still bad at this
[9094.86 --> 9101.66]  the merch the merge message thing while on android is a limitation of shop pay you were logged in and
[9101.66 --> 9107.90]  shop pay is your default selected option so it goes to shop pay and by going to shop pay it skips past
[9107.90 --> 9113.66]  that page if i remember correctly um this is not something we can fix right now because it's
[9114.86 --> 9120.78]  not something we can fix at all until shopify allows us to um they are aware of the problem
[9121.42 --> 9125.58]  i doubt it's like the highest brownie thing because they're kind of a really big company and we're just
[9125.58 --> 9131.34]  one of their many partners um but they know about it and they do seem to care and maybe eventually
[9131.34 --> 9137.66]  it'll be fine i think maybe checkout extensions in the future will allow us to fix it or something
[9137.66 --> 9141.82]  i don't know it's been a long time since i've had that conversation all i know right now is there's
[9141.82 --> 9146.38]  not much we can do about it right now or maybe something recent allowed us to i don't know last
[9146.38 --> 9150.54]  time we looked into we couldn't we've been working on the new theme the new themes coming like real soon
[9150.54 --> 9155.42]  fast so once that's out maybe we'll look back into those types of things this is so sweet i just got a
[9155.42 --> 9161.26]  message from patrick kennedy from uh serve the home sorry for the late note yeah i'm still working uh
[9161.26 --> 9166.86]  just wanted to say thank you for looking at me like i was a moron for not doing video on that walk in
[9166.86 --> 9172.30]  taipei we just hit 100 000 subscribers it's been super fun thanks for the inspiration yeah you bet
[9172.30 --> 9178.54]  man i mean you were video man it's it's the way it's the way it's the way and they've been killing
[9178.54 --> 9185.34]  it over there they've been doing a great job more john more i mean we have more we got more this is
[9185.34 --> 9191.42]  from uh christian uh hey guys first time message i missed the start of the show but uh so i don't know
[9191.42 --> 9196.22]  if you've covered it but what is your take on mr who's the boss video talking about samsung batteries
[9196.22 --> 9202.70]  expanding i've been meaning to watch it i have no excuse i've just been busy this week um what i've
[9202.70 --> 9208.38]  gathered so far from just people tweeting at me about it is that out of all the like phones that
[9208.38 --> 9214.30]  he has kicking around the samsung ones are the ones that are swelling um i would really need i i would
[9214.30 --> 9221.34]  really need to see a really big sample size of of phones to really determine if it's a samsung
[9221.34 --> 9227.74]  specific problem you got to understand samsung also makes the batteries for like a huge number of
[9227.74 --> 9233.50]  other phone makers so unless you're also seeing this pattern in other phones that have samsung
[9233.50 --> 9239.26]  batteries in them i don't know that i would read too much into it another thing that i know is that
[9239.26 --> 9245.26]  i've seen the way that some youtubers i don't know how aaron stores his phones but i've seen the
[9245.26 --> 9252.62]  way some youtubers store their phones and it's really bad um like just in a drawer or in boxes
[9253.34 --> 9260.62]  um in no particular charge state it's really bad for them so leaving them plugged in all the time
[9260.62 --> 9267.58]  is bad leaving them not plugged in for extremely long periods of time also really bad taking care like
[9267.58 --> 9272.94]  these these batteries the way that they're built into these devices are designed for everyday use
[9272.94 --> 9280.22]  they're designed to be used every day or at least every few days and not just left in a particular
[9280.22 --> 9289.98]  charge state for long periods of time um i don't know that i am able to form any kind of opinion on this
[9289.98 --> 9294.86]  at this point in time did you know because of partially because of that reasons there's emergency sat
[9294.86 --> 9301.26]  phones that are designed to run off of uh i think it's double a batteries but they have like some
[9301.26 --> 9307.66]  modern ability like i i think you can even get like maps and stuff apparently he has a rack where he stores
[9307.66 --> 9313.50]  them but i don't are they are they somehow software controlled so that they're maintained at about 50
[9313.50 --> 9322.70]  charge or are they left charged all the time um i don't know i don't know so i i just i just would
[9322.70 --> 9327.26]  have to i would have to know a lot more i'm sorry guys i just i haven't watched the video yet so hard
[9327.26 --> 9331.74]  to comment when you haven't watched it yeah i i i do intend to watch it because this has absolutely
[9331.74 --> 9336.62]  been making the rounds next up got another one from jeffrey i've been waiting for the chungis bottle
[9336.62 --> 9341.58]  since it was first revealed sorry there was one last thing i wanted to say uh if you store a lithium
[9341.58 --> 9349.98]  battery incorrectly it will swell so it's not like samsung screwed up their batteries um
[9349.98 --> 9357.98]  um so so i just i can't speak to well we'll see yeah i've been waiting for the chungis bottle
[9357.98 --> 9363.66]  curious about how youtube handles retention for videos watched at faster speeds i watch most things
[9363.66 --> 9369.34]  at one and a half times or faster and i'm worried it hurts creators it does not it counts so if you
[9369.34 --> 9375.58]  watch at 2x you the the creator gets the full watch time for the runtime of the video whatever it is
[9375.58 --> 9380.38]  that you watched yeah i watch mostly everything at two times so that's one of my wife's things is
[9380.38 --> 9384.70]  she'll be reading comments on a video and she will always just like let the video play at 2x with the
[9384.70 --> 9389.34]  volume down while she just like reads comments like on this you can just get the creator studio app you
[9389.34 --> 9397.58]  don't have to like do it like this she's like oh every view counts okay okay uh this is from colton
[9397.58 --> 9404.46]  uh luke when did you begin your path as a software engineer at what point in your tenure working with
[9404.46 --> 9408.94]  linus did you decide that that was your future path or was it something you were always working
[9408.94 --> 9415.58]  on in the background it definitely wasn't while i was working with linus um it started i inspired him
[9415.58 --> 9422.06]  and i'm not with my software development skills it's your fault yeah yeah struggling with html um
[9422.06 --> 9428.78]  um or were you good at it i don't remember there's something with html yeah i i probably was trying
[9428.78 --> 9434.94]  to like bold something and you were like okay yeah i remember something with html like really early on i
[9434.94 --> 9441.18]  don't remember what it was or what it was about um yeah i'm not by the way i just i lead a team of
[9441.18 --> 9447.82]  software developers um but i i became interested in software development really early on because my dad used
[9447.82 --> 9455.74]  to talk to me about it um like way back in the day my dad was a plus certified super into computers
[9455.74 --> 9462.54]  all the time stuff he used to talk to me about old uh like like punch card programming stuff um i
[9462.54 --> 9467.74]  remember he he almost tried to like scare me away from it at one point because he wanted me to like be
[9467.74 --> 9473.90]  sure that i was actually interested and he talked to me about the old type of debugging that they used to
[9473.90 --> 9480.22]  have to do back in the day and it used to be brutal and i had the very good experience of looking into
[9480.22 --> 9483.98]  more modern development at that time and realizing that it wasn't as bad as it used to be when he had
[9483.98 --> 9489.98]  looked into it back in the day um but yeah i was interested from a very early age and i started
[9491.42 --> 9497.90]  delving into it in like right at the beginning of high school uh there was a couple other uh people in
[9497.90 --> 9502.30]  my grade that were also interested so i had some people to bounce off of which was cool my uh
[9503.18 --> 9511.02]  my computer teacher mr trattle i believe he's still uh i think he's the principal of a school now
[9511.42 --> 9517.26]  um but he was awesome i'm not surprised that his career advanced because he was fantastic he was
[9517.26 --> 9523.42]  very accommodating to me wanting to push further and drive more i got the award for the top grade in
[9523.42 --> 9529.50]  computers 12 when i was in grade 10 which was sweet because he let me like i i completed the entire
[9529.50 --> 9534.86]  curriculum for some computer class in like a couple weeks so he let me just take the next one
[9534.86 --> 9539.58]  with the rest of that semester and then i completed that one so he like gave me some extra work and then
[9539.58 --> 9544.06]  the next semester we did like the same thing and we just stacked a bunch of courses into other ones and
[9544.06 --> 9551.90]  i ended up doing like it he he let me like build my own computers curriculum while i was there because he
[9551.90 --> 9556.78]  knew i was just very interested and he wanted to support that and i really really deeply appreciated that
[9556.78 --> 9563.02]  and that's a huge reason why i i went down that career path was because um i was very particular
[9563.02 --> 9568.46]  about like supportive teachers i tended to do really well in those classes and unsupportive teachers i
[9568.46 --> 9575.50]  tended to do really poorly in those classes um he even i don't know i'm turning this into a
[9576.22 --> 9581.58]  thing about him i don't know why but um he knew there was a bunch of kids in my grade that were really
[9581.58 --> 9587.18]  interested in in computers and software development stuff so if i remember correctly this story he went
[9587.18 --> 9596.06]  to bcit himself for a summer semester and came back and took what he learned there and created a new
[9596.06 --> 9603.02]  course for us which was 3d game development um and and in that semester we learned way more advanced
[9603.02 --> 9608.06]  development stuff than we could have otherwise we we made actual games and our final project of the
[9608.06 --> 9612.38]  course was to submit a game that had like projectile physics and all this type of stuff going
[9612.38 --> 9619.26]  and he taught us all this stuff really really cool um and that like just made me so much more
[9619.26 --> 9623.26]  interested and i kept pursuing it and then uh ended up dropping it to make youtube and then ended up
[9623.26 --> 9628.70]  picking it up again to make a float plane and then i don't know there you go do you notice half the
[9628.70 --> 9636.22]  float plane chat is staff right now i think tynan's in there it looks like jake from labs is in there i see aj in
[9636.22 --> 9643.42]  there uh dan dan are you in there and yeah i'm not a mod okay we should probably get that all
[9643.42 --> 9652.22]  message um don't don't you guys have like other things to do i mean it's uh it's almost 10 pm joe's
[9652.22 --> 9657.02]  joe's hanging out it's the only way we could find things out about the company so it's like this is our
[9657.50 --> 9663.82]  our weekly newsletter oh hey we're starting this thing called labs hey look we can't we cancelled labs
[9663.82 --> 9669.42]  we didn't cancel labs we didn't cancel labs yeah change the name i didn't know there was a christmas
[9669.42 --> 9677.50]  party awesome hilarious all right um oh i had a couple of questions from people in float plane chat
[9677.50 --> 9683.18]  though i was having a look at it um i was asked about the logitech brio scandal that random frank p
[9683.18 --> 9690.30]  posted about i have not had a chance to watch the video but it sounds like it's something pretty
[9690.30 --> 9695.18]  sketchy so you guys should go check that out or i don't know maybe it's a bad video probably
[9695.18 --> 9699.82]  isn't a bad video so yeah you guys should go check that out it comes right on the heels of i actually
[9699.82 --> 9704.86]  had asked for this to be included in the wanshow doc this week but it's not here it comes on the heels
[9704.86 --> 9711.42]  of us finding out logitech was being kind of sketchy about user reviews of their cloud gaming device
[9711.42 --> 9719.34]  so what happened after the show was it was found that my positive review with lots of stars went
[9719.34 --> 9725.98]  through no problem so it was reviewed and ultimately was submitted to the site or was posted on the site
[9725.98 --> 9732.78]  and my more balanced uh two star review was not posted so whatever curation process was taking place
[9732.78 --> 9739.18]  we demonstrated that more stars were going through and less stars were not which really raises a lot of
[9739.18 --> 9744.86]  questions about logitech's transparency and the way that they curate user reviews on their site because
[9744.86 --> 9752.30]  they're not really useful if they're just only positive are they um then then what happened is
[9752.30 --> 9760.46]  all of the reviews were wiped except for my two star review for a bit then like the next day all the
[9760.46 --> 9764.62]  reviews were pulled and they formally said oh we're not putting reviews on this page because this thing isn't
[9764.62 --> 9772.94]  even out yet fishy yeah that doesn't really like fix the problem no and you haven't really addressed
[9772.94 --> 9778.70]  what you guys are doing not at all with reviews on other product pages for example one quick thing
[9778.70 --> 9784.62]  just because i think there's some of this happening right now if you if you are staff and you want to
[9784.62 --> 9791.82]  staff like in flowplane chat email support at flowplane.com from your official work email that is the only way to do it
[9791.82 --> 9799.10]  i just use linus's account oh no don't do that yeah uh no it's not actually my account it's the
[9799.74 --> 9804.06]  we don't use a channel account account yeah the name in chat though is just linus so everyone
[9804.06 --> 9809.90]  always thinks it's you yeah which is also a problem that's very problematic yes more merch messages uh
[9809.90 --> 9819.18]  razer apparently also has a competitor to it so what i guess that's something yeah i don't know
[9819.18 --> 9828.78]  but they're really focused on like cellular so so expensive and worse in every way
[9830.94 --> 9836.14]  okay cool i like ours technica's uh headline here razer is making a streaming focused handheld
[9836.14 --> 9844.54]  console for some reason yeah yeah yeah yeah that's super legit oh man yikes i like it
[9844.54 --> 9854.86]  frank's uh video title is spicy what is it logitech is lying in all caps to us to us
[9857.18 --> 9858.54]  i gotta watch that that's interesting
[9861.66 --> 9867.98]  okay you want another one uh what product has the highest margins on the ltt store so i know what to
[9867.98 --> 9873.66]  buy next also will you have four xl hoodies t-shirts for us bigger folks in the future uh
[9873.66 --> 9879.82]  yes we will we are working on that uh i know it's taking longer than we'd like but we are working on it
[9879.82 --> 9886.30]  now that we've got our big like 50 000 t-shirt order of the standard sizes we can turn our attention to our
[9886.30 --> 9893.74]  extended sizes we want to do husky boy lanky boy smaller and bigger so that's that's a goal i know i've been
[9893.74 --> 9897.50]  talking about it a long time but it's taken us a long time to get our own shirt lengths going they're
[9897.50 --> 9902.78]  really good though i'm really happy with them but it takes time um as for what product has the highest
[9902.78 --> 9908.86]  margins uh you can buy gift cards and then never redeem them oh oh yeah well that's true
[9908.86 --> 9913.82]  genius cut them up if you just want to send a donation hey we're more than happy to take it
[9913.82 --> 9918.22]  and then if you ever change your mind you can buy something on the store win-win that's fair enough
[9918.22 --> 9923.74]  uh someone in chat said uh this might be more for the asian market my family is from taiwan and they
[9923.74 --> 9933.02]  primarily use cellular data even for home stream and computers and i have heard of that okay but like
[9933.02 --> 9940.22]  for gaming yeah this is a thing i've heard of this before but like multiplayer gaming yeah it's totally
[9940.22 --> 9945.42]  a thing i mean are you even have like cell boosters and stuff and their their cell setups they are just
[9945.42 --> 9950.38]  like better than what we have yeah i mean maybe which makes sense population density tiny island
[9950.38 --> 9953.74]  versus canada yeah i mean okay
[9957.58 --> 9962.86]  i'm not into it but like yeah maybe that's why razors doing it i don't know they do have the like
[9962.86 --> 9970.86]  actual in-location razor store in taiwan stuff like that yeah glad you enjoyed the video solar daddy
[9970.86 --> 9978.30]  watch the fight video says it's uh incredible most underrated video this year it's good heck
[9978.30 --> 9982.06]  yeah by the way there were a couple things i had intended to reply to last week i put them in a
[9982.06 --> 9987.98]  notepad doc here captain said said are you going to do a 2022 update on how you guys make money i was
[9987.98 --> 9993.58]  thinking about it i felt like it might be a little soon but it's changed a lot it still feels like it's
[9993.58 --> 9999.34]  soon even though it's changed a lot yeah but it's changed a lot like it's really different so i don't
[9999.34 --> 10004.86]  know if people if i if the idea of the series is that people know how we make money right now they
[10004.86 --> 10008.86]  don't fair enough fair enough and then nipless cage
[10013.34 --> 10017.66]  said seriously though if you want a chance to get on the merch message list you have to buy early
[10017.66 --> 10021.82]  but you don't get the deals till the middle of the stream i hate it that's not true it doesn't matter
[10021.82 --> 10028.06]  when you buy it you're selected based on what the producer decides to curate and all the curated ones
[10028.06 --> 10033.42]  we do do a lot of questions that don't get curated might be really good but we might have answered
[10033.42 --> 10037.98]  them last week yeah and so you might just get a text reply and it might show up down here so you
[10037.98 --> 10043.42]  just got to kind of watch for it sorry we're doing our best with it or we get like 40 at the same time
[10043.42 --> 10048.94]  and i fat finger gotta pick one of them or that yeah which is why we like merch messages so much
[10048.94 --> 10054.70]  because then if we don't reply to it at least you get your order in the mail yeah uh last one i guess
[10054.70 --> 10063.82]  okay yeah let's do it uh this is from bill hovercraft.com a project startup from lmg like
[10063.82 --> 10068.78]  floatplane but instead of video streaming it's a cloud gaming service maybe start off with retro
[10068.78 --> 10074.06]  or public domain games first then triple a game how did this get curated no it wasn't me that was me
[10074.62 --> 10080.22]  linus i'm just messing with you they're going to blame me i don't want more insanely difficult
[10080.22 --> 10085.74]  projects i would i would like some uh some some softballs for the development team you could you
[10085.74 --> 10092.78]  could get a real cdn like azure yeah let's let's take a an absolutely miniscule size team and make
[10092.78 --> 10097.10]  one of the hardest possible things you can do on the internet and also let's not use the cloud
[10097.10 --> 10102.38]  services because those are expensive but hey they restrict you at least we won't cancel it that's true
[10102.38 --> 10109.82]  that we're still around cancel it when floatplane goes under never it can't sink it's in the name
[10110.94 --> 10115.74]  i don't know could flip over nope you put all the all the cdn weight on one side
[10117.34 --> 10123.66]  hardware costs on the same side development costs on the other side okay it's balanced we're fine
[10123.66 --> 10128.38]  okay there's two more we might as well just do them anonymous asks would you happen to know why
[10128.38 --> 10137.18]  nvidia is charging so much in australia the 4090 converts uh from usd to 2400 australian dollars but
[10137.18 --> 10144.78]  it's actually 2900 so it's a combination of things it's resellers taking advantage of that australians
[10144.78 --> 10149.10]  are used to paying more for things and taking more margin in all likelihood whether that's distributors
[10149.10 --> 10153.66]  whether that's the actual retailers i couldn't tell you but i i pretty much guarantee you there's some
[10153.66 --> 10159.74]  of that happening and then nvidia is probably playing that game too um a lot of the time
[10159.74 --> 10163.82]  they're also like import taxes there can also be import taxes and tariffs that are not the fault
[10163.82 --> 10170.62]  of the manufacturers so it could be some combination of those three would be my best guess
[10171.26 --> 10177.02]  i'm gonna archive that now and finally tyler d asks y'all mentioned dev jobs earlier are you
[10177.02 --> 10180.94]  interested in newer graduates i have over a year of dev experience and think working with you guys is
[10180.94 --> 10184.86]  a dream job well it's harder than you think for one thing we're not like this fun all the time
[10185.50 --> 10191.74]  we're not actually really taking any applications right now i do have a position on the team now that
[10191.74 --> 10197.82]  is is supposed to be more of a transitionary transitionary position which is a junior position
[10197.82 --> 10202.46]  the idea is that you you come in work as a junior eventually we we push you forward onto other projects
[10202.46 --> 10208.22]  and then the next person comes into that slot um but the person filling that position is newly in that
[10208.22 --> 10216.06]  position so that's amazing i have to wait some time uh jake jake from the lab is uh is is particularly
[10216.06 --> 10220.86]  passionate about stadia i don't think he was in the chat while we were discussing it earlier but he's
[10220.86 --> 10225.42]  like as someone who tested stadia extensively it had the absolute without question best platform
[10225.42 --> 10232.70]  technology wise and you know what that's that's a super good point but it doesn't google man yeah the
[10232.70 --> 10238.38]  trust isn't there yeah just that it does it sucks it sucks they did this they built something really
[10238.38 --> 10243.26]  cool and then we're like lol forget it i completely believe him as far as my understanding went the
[10243.26 --> 10250.38]  tech was fantastic the problem is that like the the red dead player six thousand hours into red dead and
[10250.38 --> 10256.06]  it's gone now yeah you can't trust them with this type of stuff yeah like we never at any point said
[10256.06 --> 10262.54]  stadia was bad tech you know and so i get why people are so frustrated and passionate about it
[10263.50 --> 10269.42]  it's just google doing google things man it sucks and i think that's pretty much it for the show today
[10269.42 --> 10276.54]  it's gotta be thanks for watching we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel i'm
[10276.54 --> 10282.22]  going to bed bye yeah i hear you oh wait i'm not supposed to do this right no can i do it because
[10282.22 --> 10289.66]  there's no thing right there's oh so then you you you could yeah i guess but you might as well just do it
[10289.66 --> 10292.94]  through here and get used to it because that's how you're supposed to do it oh i'm supposed to do it
