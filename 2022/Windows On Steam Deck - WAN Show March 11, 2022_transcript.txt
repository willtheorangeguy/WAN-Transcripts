[0.00 --> 1.52]  okay i've resumed the selected
[4.40 --> 8.96]  welcome to the wan show hey we've got a great show for you guys today ladies and gentlemen
[8.96 --> 14.24]  that's right this is an episode of a podcast that will not get pulled down by big tech
[15.28 --> 20.64]  i thought you weren't gonna bring it up because it will not have any misinformation in it well it
[20.64 --> 25.04]  might have misinformation and i can't guarantee that yeah lots of great topics this week guys
[25.04 --> 31.12]  apple's peak performance event product announcements were many and actually exciting
[31.84 --> 40.00]  uh artesian builds who generated significant controversy last week has formally completely
[40.00 --> 45.52]  pooped all over itself and the bed and the floor so we're gonna get through that what else we got
[45.52 --> 51.28]  today we got windows on a steam deck what maybe windows on a steam deck yeah well where what do
[51.28 --> 59.52]  you look through to see a door a door a wheel a wheel well what one has more doors or wheels okay
[59.52 --> 66.80]  who knows also lime wire is back what whoa your har fiddle dee dee being a pirate is
[69.92 --> 78.80]  except this time it's worse
[81.28 --> 93.84]  the show is brought to you by jump cloud vulture and dream host now this is not fair the ryan the
[93.84 --> 100.88]  ryan asks in float plane chat is it a great show if every show is a great show yes yes yeah because
[100.88 --> 107.04]  it's relative to i don't know what it's relative to i was going to say other shows but i don't know
[107.04 --> 115.52]  that other shows are probably better let's jump right into our big topic which is windows on steam
[115.52 --> 121.60]  deck now i was actually expecting to get windows support for the steam deck before we did our
[121.60 --> 128.96]  initial hardware review right so that was way back like over a month ago i was expecting windows drivers
[128.96 --> 136.40]  and valve kept saying oh we we have them but we can't send them something something legal review
[136.40 --> 141.52]  something something something okay sorry we we can't give them to you but but apparently there
[141.52 --> 147.60]  were working drivers which makes sense because while there was obviously a lot of work to be done by
[147.60 --> 152.64]  amd and valve software teams particularly i would think amd for something like a closed source windows
[152.64 --> 160.64]  driver i mean these were these were mostly known quantities right there there's n3 cores and they're
[160.64 --> 168.80]  bolted to an rdna2 onboard graphics chip rather than um a vega based graphics chip but fundamentally that
[168.80 --> 173.84]  architecture exists already so they're not starting from scratch right like they're there there's a
[173.84 --> 181.28]  starting point that they have to work from um so so i was i was expecting it to be pretty mature and
[181.28 --> 188.00]  pretty fleshed out and i was expecting it to come before our hardware review where we looked at uh we looked at
[188.00 --> 195.52]  thermals uh we looked at uh performance we looked at acoustics and and pretty much ran all the way
[195.52 --> 202.16]  through the deck and you know major kudos to valve they did a great job of transparency and allowing us
[202.16 --> 207.84]  to really fully test it even though we were limited in terms of game selection just because the software
[207.84 --> 212.96]  really wasn't ready yet and they knew that and that was fine but they told us that the windows
[212.96 --> 218.08]  drivers were going to come like i didn't i didn't just pull that out of thin air oh well i am expecting
[218.08 --> 222.48]  windows drivers because i am a windows user it wasn't like that they told us they were going to
[222.48 --> 229.12]  come give me what i want then in between the hardware review so so we had the lead up to the hardware
[229.12 --> 234.00]  review so then we published the hardware review and then in between the publishing of the hardware review
[234.56 --> 241.36]  and the release of our software review i was expecting windows drivers again and when i when i shot the
[241.36 --> 248.64]  software review it was actually the morning of my family's ski trip to um right i don't know what it's
[248.64 --> 253.68]  called anymore but it used to be called hemlock mountain and we were going there and basically i
[253.68 --> 260.96]  had to shoot it then because i kept putting off and putting off and putting off starting the software
[260.96 --> 269.12]  review because valve kept sending just they kept inundating me with software updates and i was still
[269.12 --> 276.16]  expecting a windows driver so i went and i did like i played on it i used it i i did spend a lot of time
[276.16 --> 282.16]  with it and i i wrote down a lot of thoughts i threw a lot of things at the page but i couldn't write the
[282.16 --> 288.96]  video because i couldn't tell the whole story because i hadn't like if they were going to drop a windows
[288.96 --> 297.36]  driver on me two days before publication i was going to have to have like a big section comparing linux to
[297.36 --> 303.04]  windows performance for example like if i'm if i'm supposed to say this is the software review
[303.04 --> 309.36]  i it changes the angle of the video right yeah what i'm going to cover in it so i ended up staying
[309.36 --> 317.12]  up until 7 30 in the morning and then i only slept for about two hours and then i went i met a camera
[317.12 --> 321.28]  crew at like the new house because that's where they were set up doing some sponsored thing for telus
[321.28 --> 328.48]  already anyway shot the a roll and then drove to the mountain afterward because i had to leave it to
[328.48 --> 335.36]  the very last second so again there was a period of time when i was expecting windows drivers well they
[335.36 --> 342.48]  finally arrived this week like yesterday and naturally we dropped absolutely everything and
[342.48 --> 347.04]  immediately set to work testing them and i got to tell you you guys are going to want to watch the full
[347.04 --> 353.20]  video because the exact numbers matter and i i don't remember everything off the top of my head but
[353.20 --> 359.52]  anthony and i had a really good meeting about sort of what we want the scope of this video to be because
[360.16 --> 365.92]  i i don't think that okay in the state they're in
[365.92 --> 378.80]  i don't want to invest too much time investigating the performance differences between the in between
[378.80 --> 387.36]  the nvidia the nvidia between the linux and the windows drivers oh my okay yeah so uh we had a really
[387.36 --> 395.12]  good chat about what we want the scope of the video to be and man did we ever find a ton of interesting
[395.12 --> 403.04]  stuff going on almost immediately um and then also we had a really we we sat down we did a full script
[403.04 --> 407.92]  review we almost never get to like sit down and talk to anthony about stuff anymore because he hosts
[407.92 --> 413.04]  so many of the videos that he writes now instead of me editing and me hosting them so it was actually
[413.04 --> 418.96]  really nice to say because we often will just chat about stuff and and i feel like we end up with
[419.52 --> 424.08]  regardless of whether it's me who reviews it i think we end up with a better script a better video
[424.08 --> 429.04]  if a second pair of eyes looks at it and starts to you know ask those questions right that someone
[429.76 --> 433.44]  sometimes you just you got your nose buried in it for too long there's certain questions that you've
[433.44 --> 437.68]  had answered for so long but you don't really think about it or you take something for granted one of
[437.68 --> 442.72]  our new writers came in uh talking to me about a video that we were doing about whether it matters if
[442.72 --> 448.88]  your gpu is still getting drivers so we took drivers that have been unsupported for in some cases
[448.88 --> 456.72]  years yeah and tried to run very new games on them to see well just how far does direct x get you
[456.72 --> 462.00]  you know can you can you just limp along and probably have compatibility or do you need a game ready driver
[462.00 --> 470.16]  right and really interesting findings but we went into this whole explanation without having any kind of
[470.16 --> 475.84]  paragraph outlining like a prepper what is direct x yeah or something like that i can't remember if it was
[475.84 --> 480.88]  exactly that but we were we were missing some key piece of information like hey you actually can't
[480.88 --> 486.80]  take that for granted this could be something that you know uh some young kid just getting into pc gaming
[486.80 --> 491.84]  watches and we need to give them at least okay it might be a little jargony but we need to give them at
[491.84 --> 498.96]  least a basic explanation of what purpose this serves before we can we can move past it so anyway i sat down
[498.96 --> 507.92]  with anthony and and we talked through it and boy is it ever a mixed bag so first up good guy valve
[508.80 --> 513.76]  providing windows drivers sure yeah they could have just as easily not done it in fact it would have
[513.76 --> 521.44]  been a lot less work for them and amd because you got to remember even though these are zen 3 cpu cores
[521.44 --> 532.80]  cores and rdna2 based gpu cores they are bolted together glued together in a custom soc this is a
[532.80 --> 540.80]  custom chip so there is absolutely extra work that needed to be done compounding matters is that aside
[540.80 --> 548.16]  from being a custom chip it has at least in the pc space from my experience a pretty unique
[548.16 --> 558.00]  um system architecture it doesn't have main system memory and gpu memory right which is normal for an
[558.00 --> 566.24]  integrated gpu but with an integrated gpu at this kind of performance level were there unique challenges
[567.28 --> 574.48]  presumably these are challenges amd is probably going to have to face as they move into uh their upcoming uh
[574.48 --> 581.60]  rdna2 based ig uh like apus yes but definitely they could have saved themselves some work and they
[581.60 --> 590.00]  could have kicked some work down the road but absolutely also as soon as valve provides a driver
[590.00 --> 598.24]  they will start receiving support tickets and even if even if every message they get about running windows
[598.24 --> 604.40]  on the steam deck they just send back a canned response that says we don't support windows on the
[604.40 --> 612.64]  steam deck which is their formal stance right they have provided these drivers but it is not a supported
[613.20 --> 622.96]  use case it is still creating extra busy work for valve corporation oh for sure absolutely and from our
[622.96 --> 631.84]  experience with it it could create more support tickets than less so there's a few things to keep
[631.84 --> 639.60]  in mind one is that not all drivers are available first and foremost the wi-fi drivers are not baked into
[639.60 --> 646.64]  windows actually no first and foremost you will not be running the latest version of windows support for
[646.64 --> 654.32]  the ftpm so the the trusted platform module that is required for windows 11 is not baked into the
[654.32 --> 661.44]  firmware yet i do not want windows 11 anyways so you cannot well remember this is a touch screen device
[661.44 --> 668.48]  windows 11 has a lot of improvements for touch screen devices that's fair yeah so you might want windows
[668.48 --> 673.76]  11 whether you are correct or not um that's a whole separate conversation that we're not going to get into
[673.76 --> 678.08]  today but so first and foremost you can't install the latest version of windows so you are stuck with
[678.08 --> 684.56]  windows 10 for better or for worse second of all when you install windows you're going to have to go get
[684.56 --> 692.08]  some kind of network network adapter or something because i don't know if you've had this experience but
[692.08 --> 700.16]  windows installers recently have stopped allowing you to go to proceed past the setup phase unless you have
[700.16 --> 705.60]  an internet connection and unless you sign into a microsoft account there are workarounds to be
[705.60 --> 712.08]  clear yeah but for most people like for the is a console that's the way we have to be fair i don't
[712.08 --> 715.76]  think if you're looking at it from the perspective of a console gamer i don't think they're going to
[715.76 --> 720.88]  install windows that's too much of an advanced move unless there's a game they like really want to
[720.88 --> 727.52]  play and they find a super basic tutorial to get them through it they might if it's a super basic tutorial
[727.52 --> 731.84]  it would probably include this portion though it might include it but you might have to go out and
[731.84 --> 736.64]  buy one yeah unless you already have a type c to ethernet adapter for your switch for example or
[736.64 --> 742.00]  something like that so you may have to go out and get some other network adapter because the onboard
[742.00 --> 748.00]  wi-fi module is does not have support baked into windows yeah so you'll need a network connection in
[748.00 --> 753.92]  order to get a network connection i'm so surprised this networking device did not have support baked into
[753.92 --> 760.08]  windows i know right okay once you're in windows you can install wi-fi drivers bluetooth works which
[760.08 --> 766.56]  is great valve does not have an audio driver yet for the onboard speakers or for the three and a
[766.56 --> 772.24]  half mil jack they are working on that okay that's coming and then there were also some other devices
[772.24 --> 777.84]  in device manager that just were still yellow exclamation marks we don't know exactly what they were
[777.84 --> 785.28]  what they were yeah yeah um did you try all the different input types and everything okay well yeah
[785.28 --> 792.56]  yeah yeah yeah we tried bluetooth and usbc and they were both fine uh thumbsticks pads on the back so
[793.76 --> 802.24]  windows navigation on the steam deck oh boy not great okay because the default behavior for the steam deck
[802.24 --> 812.88]  is a is enter b is escape and the ability for applications okay so first of all valve did uh
[812.88 --> 818.88]  valve does allow a steam controller to be used as like a joystick to mouse device okay so you can
[818.88 --> 823.12]  actually use it to move the mouse around and remember trackpads yeah so you can actually move the mouse
[823.12 --> 831.92]  around with the trackpad work okay except when it stops okay right yikes all right and if you close
[831.92 --> 839.20]  steam then is it the trackpad you know the trackpad still works but the joystick input stops working
[839.20 --> 846.08]  for the mouse no or something like that but if you have steam open in the background so you can use
[846.08 --> 851.60]  the joystick or whatever and you go to open software like retroarch which has controller support
[853.20 --> 860.24]  retroarch will not grab the controller properly it's being used so what happens is even trying to
[860.24 --> 866.24]  do something as simple as navigating the menu in retroarch you try to go back you try to just like go back a
[866.24 --> 869.76]  couple menus escape escape retroarch is closed oh no
[872.48 --> 880.48]  so it's pretty freaking rough it's pretty rough right now and i haven't even gotten to game performance
[881.92 --> 890.00]  my expectation was that compatibility we didn't test a really broad set of games because quite frankly
[890.24 --> 897.12]  i i don't feel there was a ton to be learned from that like yeah game compatibility is going to be
[897.12 --> 902.96]  more windowsy so if there's anti-cheat software that doesn't run in linux or that the developer
[903.84 --> 909.44]  you know intentionally prevents from running on linux because realistically that's what most of it is these
[909.44 --> 915.28]  days as far as we can tell if if there's it's either prevents or it's they haven't taken the action to
[915.28 --> 924.08]  allow it yeah so uh you know whether it's anti-cheat or whether it's just games that proton or what's
[924.08 --> 931.76]  it called steam play now i think so i forget steam play hasn't caught up to um game compatibility is
[931.76 --> 939.60]  going to be better but performance well i was expecting it to be i was expecting it to trade blows
[939.60 --> 946.08]  because we've looked at this before we've run into situations where linux underperforms windows because
[946.08 --> 953.36]  trans translation can have a cost we've run into situations where uh the translation has a cost but
[953.36 --> 958.72]  linux is also just like lighter and you end up with them canceling each other out you get performance
[958.72 --> 964.80]  parity and we've even seen situations where the drivers on linux are better than the proprietary
[964.80 --> 969.36]  drivers that exist on windows and linux actually manages to squeeze more out of the hardware than
[969.36 --> 976.88]  windows but there tends to be like that back and forth on the steam deck it was just annihilation
[977.68 --> 985.36]  in all the titles we tested like linux just ran away from windows and some of this we expected like
[985.36 --> 992.72]  elden ring for example valve has put work specifically into fixing uh i think it's some kind of um
[992.72 --> 1002.32]  uh oh man like texture optimization thing that they've done uh what is it compiling shaders and
[1002.32 --> 1006.16]  this was like a big issue on windows to the point where people were saying it was like almost unplayable
[1006.16 --> 1013.52]  huge issue on windows um and so so what valve has actually done it's it's kind of insane is they've
[1013.52 --> 1020.56]  taken a feature that um the elden ring developers should have implemented in direct x and they've
[1020.56 --> 1026.72]  hacked it in as part of the direct x to vulcan translation very funny and moving out the game
[1026.72 --> 1033.84]  big move because elden rings freaking huge right now shader yeah shader cache okay um so what's crazy
[1033.84 --> 1039.84]  about it elden ring is so bad that it's it's not it's not as simple as just seeing a new asset and
[1039.84 --> 1045.60]  waiting for it to compile you could even stand in one room and spin around and it'll stutter constantly
[1046.24 --> 1051.76]  because it's just not cashing them so right yeah now i now i remember to be clear elden ring itself
[1051.76 --> 1057.28]  is not bad um i haven't played it yet i actually i started horizon zero dawn on my recent trip and so
[1057.28 --> 1060.88]  i've been making my way through that i have new thoughts on that by the way i can talk about that
[1060.88 --> 1065.60]  more later on the show but i'm done now so i've seen you launching i keep on wanting to ask you to
[1065.60 --> 1069.68]  play halo but i'm like i can't play halo i'm playing i'm steam deck only right now
[1069.68 --> 1078.40]  man i i honestly i have used it almost zero as a desktop though because i i have i i i said it's
[1078.40 --> 1084.88]  not for work and almost all of my desktop computer usage has been work so i'm just happily gaming on my
[1084.88 --> 1092.08]  steam deck sort of i'm gonna talk about that later so it was it was a bloodbath though which really
[1092.08 --> 1102.80]  surprised me because on paper the rdna2 graphics on the steam deck were terrifying for competitors
[1102.80 --> 1107.36]  who are stuck with vega graphics right yeah on their own windows based handhelds but then those
[1107.36 --> 1113.92]  guys have windows based handhelds but the thing is that maybe that's if you were able to if the steam
[1113.92 --> 1121.60]  deck was performing up to its expectations though it it should be better than those windows first
[1121.60 --> 1128.32]  handhelds running last generation gpu technology that might be interesting because that might actually
[1128.32 --> 1135.28]  keep a space carved out for those other devices because if like i don't know valve is gonna make it
[1135.28 --> 1141.12]  better well the thing is it's a proprietary driver so should it mostly be down to amd to make it better
[1141.12 --> 1148.72]  in that case though i don't know if amd has much pressure on them from valve yeah maybe amd has
[1148.72 --> 1153.68]  very little motivation to make these anything other like if they're straight up saying like
[1153.68 --> 1159.12]  we are not supporting this then what what's the what's the pressure on them to support it better
[1159.12 --> 1166.24]  you know what i mean yeah so much nothing it might just not get better and if so then then at least
[1166.24 --> 1170.96]  those other devices have a space which is kind of cool yeah and valve has said that when
[1170.96 --> 1176.64]  the full steam os 3.0 installer launches they will have support for dual booting so maybe that's
[1176.64 --> 1182.24]  just a price they're willing to pay there will be a performance hit but you can have compatibility
[1182.24 --> 1187.36]  but we took the safest possible path for everything rather than pushing the performance to the bleeding
[1187.36 --> 1192.32]  edge because we expect you to do the vast majority of your gaming in steam os yeah having the ability
[1192.32 --> 1201.84]  to do a boot on there would be sweet actually now i have uh we get into this in a bit more detail on in
[1201.84 --> 1208.64]  the video so you'll you'll still have to watch it haha got him but i want to talk about doing the
[1208.64 --> 1214.08]  majority of your gaming on steam os a little bit actually no first i'm going to talk about how there
[1214.08 --> 1218.24]  are other interface issues with the steam deck like the fact that it doesn't have a task manager
[1218.24 --> 1222.96]  or a control delete button the quick access menu button doesn't do anything it doesn't have a task
[1222.96 --> 1226.56]  manager what do you like it doesn't have a task manager button oh so if you're like stuck in a
[1226.56 --> 1233.52]  full screen application and it and it hangs just turn it off your sol plug it go find a keyboard
[1234.24 --> 1238.88]  plug it in and press control alt delete like you you're stuck a lot of the windows handhelds will have
[1238.88 --> 1244.48]  a show desktop button or something or uh like aya has a software interface that you can bring up to slide
[1244.48 --> 1249.92]  over top of full screen apps and you can assign some way to force yourself out exactly exactly like it's
[1251.44 --> 1258.40]  it's made to compensate for windows right so the one not built for windows doesn't have that system
[1258.40 --> 1263.92]  yeah exactly you're you're gonna have these problems so we're ready for you right all right
[1263.92 --> 1271.68]  which isn't to say that running steam os on a steam deck is necessarily a flawless victory you know
[1271.68 --> 1281.04]  perfect experience yeah horizon zero dawn is a verified title on the steam deck and man i was
[1281.04 --> 1290.80]  blown away i think i'm running at medium 800p like 7 1280 by 800. yeah uh getting like solid 30 fps uh
[1290.80 --> 1297.28]  playable you know playable i ran into a weird issue where like aim assist is enabled but i swear it's not
[1297.28 --> 1306.16]  working like i as far as i can tell and that game i think i talked last week about how tedious a lot of
[1306.16 --> 1314.08]  the encounters were okay if you don't hit the exact weak points on these fast moving enemies it can be
[1314.08 --> 1321.44]  like a controller snapper in terms of difficulty you really don't want to snap that controller yeah
[1321.44 --> 1327.68]  right and i think a big part of the problem is that my auto aim was not doing anything
[1329.28 --> 1334.16]  which raises some questions that might make sense because i know you brought that up and i remember
[1334.16 --> 1338.32]  thinking like i don't think i really had a lot of trouble with that but yeah it's probably because
[1338.32 --> 1345.04]  the aim assist it's probably because something about the steam deck or the steam controller
[1345.04 --> 1354.40]  is showing up differently to a normal like x input input device or something like that so that's
[1355.28 --> 1364.24]  interesting uh defiance says horizon zero dawn is not a hard game linus tell you what you go play it
[1364.24 --> 1373.44]  you go fight a thunder whatever a thunder jaw with a controller with no aim assist i'll wait i actually i got
[1373.44 --> 1378.64]  significantly better i was playing doom eternal as part of a another video today you're so much better
[1379.44 --> 1384.56]  and i'm like way better with the controller now after spending like 25 hours in horizon zero dawn
[1384.56 --> 1389.84]  that makes sense i like people keep what most people talk all the time about how aim assist is like
[1389.84 --> 1395.28]  cheating and it's like okay there's maybe some arguments there but using a controller without aim assist
[1395.28 --> 1401.60]  is just horrible yes so like i yeah you gotta have it on yeah thunder jaws aren't that hard actually
[1401.60 --> 1407.36]  i i i know it's no problem if you can start knocking off components and if i was on a mouse and
[1407.36 --> 1413.36]  keyboard it would be a non-issue the problem is that i'm on a controller and any controller is going
[1413.36 --> 1419.28]  to have subtle dead zones so when you're like leaping for bullet time and trying to like make that really
[1419.28 --> 1426.96]  small adjustment for that you like jumped it yeah it can be it can be it can be very frustrating uh anyway
[1426.96 --> 1432.64]  where where was i where was i going with this right the first five hours of the game though solid 30 fps
[1432.64 --> 1440.08]  great experience you get you know the noise bothers me more than it did in the review the just the wine
[1440.08 --> 1444.16]  of the fan like yvonne was even asking about it i'm sitting there in bed playing horizon zero dawn and
[1444.16 --> 1451.28]  she's like what's that noise yeah it's the steam deck fan um i spent most of my time pre-software review
[1451.28 --> 1457.52]  with earphones in but i've actually been using speakers with it now more just because circumstances
[1457.52 --> 1461.84]  have dictated that that's been that's been sensible and i'm finding the i'm finding the fan kind of
[1461.84 --> 1470.16]  annoying basically under half volume it's pretty overpowering after about five hours in i started getting
[1470.16 --> 1476.56]  all manner of weird issues and i didn't think to whip out a camera and record any of it unfortunately so anthony's
[1476.56 --> 1483.36]  asked me to replicate it and the the the good and bad news is that it's going to be real easy
[1483.36 --> 1488.64]  because at first i started running into these issues like after two continuous hours of gameplay
[1488.64 --> 1495.92]  where i would get stuttering down to like one fps yikes for 10 30 seconds at a time and then it would
[1495.92 --> 1502.56]  like like like catch up oh it does the like fast forward thing a little bit not quite okay yeah especially
[1502.56 --> 1508.56]  if it was a cut scene it would be like but like not all the time was accounted for it was very strange
[1508.56 --> 1514.56]  right yeah yeah like i wouldn't miss anything even if it was only a short i don't know yeah super weird
[1514.56 --> 1523.36]  okay uh i saw i saw game crashes just hard crash hard crash back to back to steam interface i even saw
[1524.08 --> 1530.56]  black screen device unresponsive steam button does nothing quick access menu does nothing
[1531.28 --> 1540.00]  long press power button full reboot is the only way to solve it and the problem for me is that those as i
[1540.00 --> 1552.00]  got into the late game started to come up every 20 minutes or so which is pretty bad everything from
[1552.00 --> 1563.68]  worse stutters to completely game breaking like progress losing issues those are the worst was
[1563.68 --> 1569.60]  happening so frequently that i mean i told anthony because he hadn't had that experience he only
[1570.16 --> 1576.88]  has benchmarked steam deck so far so i was i was contributing that to to our video today and and i told
[1576.88 --> 1583.44]  anthony like it's it i have gotten more game crashes in my playthrough of horizon zero dawn than i've
[1583.44 --> 1592.72]  probably had with every game all combined in the last five years yeah like i get so many crashes and
[1592.72 --> 1597.92]  again this is and i know you're reviewing the steam deck and this is a verified title and all that kind
[1597.92 --> 1603.60]  of stuff but this is why i stopped playing it on pc really oh so you had a lot of crashes in that game on
[1603.60 --> 1609.20]  yes didn't they mostly fix that though maybe i've heard that they have from the community i have not
[1609.20 --> 1614.32]  gone back and tried it since um i will at some point because i really want to eventually like beat that
[1614.32 --> 1620.96]  game but um yeah it was crashing so hard on me on windows that i just like refused to keep playing
[1620.96 --> 1626.64]  because i kept on losing progress and that just rose oh that i hate that it's i think everybody does
[1626.64 --> 1634.24]  it's just absolutely hate that uh someone said 25 hours is not late game lmao lmao uh for the first
[1634.24 --> 1639.28]  five to eight i was doing a lot of the side quests but honestly i i figured out what was bothering me
[1639.28 --> 1644.96]  about the game so much they've built this incredible world they've done all this world building and it's
[1644.96 --> 1652.40]  populated with all of these muppets yeah like almost everyone you talk to like if you turn if you turn
[1652.40 --> 1656.96]  off the uh the quest indicator that just takes you straight to the person you're supposed to talk to
[1657.60 --> 1664.08]  you've got all these unique looking people that just repeat the same dozen pre-baked i'm sorry i have
[1664.08 --> 1669.92]  nothing to talk to you about right now so not having that indicator on is just an utter waste of time
[1669.92 --> 1678.40]  so it it's this enormous world full of all these settlements and cities that has absolutely no life
[1678.40 --> 1684.16]  it has a little bit of uh first game in a series syndrome uh like i used to talk about this with
[1684.16 --> 1690.00]  assassin's creed a fair amount where the first assassin's creed game is like a really cool uh proof
[1690.00 --> 1696.64]  of concept right there's a lot of things that are like yup that should be a lot better or a lot more
[1696.64 --> 1699.76]  fleshed out or whatever and then you get assassin's creed 2 and it's like okay sweet
[1699.92 --> 1705.44]  here we go this is what we actually wanted um and i have a feeling that uh forbidden west like i've
[1705.44 --> 1708.96]  heard from a lot of people that these types of problems that you're that you're mentioning
[1708.96 --> 1716.16]  are fixed or better in in forbidden west um so i i think it's i think it's a lot of like they built
[1716.16 --> 1722.08]  this massive new world it's a it's a similar game to some other games but they do they do a fair amount
[1722.08 --> 1726.64]  of things uniquely and it's a new ip and all this kind of stuff so certain things are not really all that
[1726.64 --> 1732.08]  fleshed out so after that first like five to eight hours i just got really bored of samey side quests
[1732.08 --> 1737.60]  and realized that you don't need to grind at all because there's almost zero leveling up progression
[1737.60 --> 1741.76]  anyway so i just started chasing the main quest and that's a weird problem with modern games some
[1741.76 --> 1746.48]  modern games if you don't do the side quests you're just like screwed yeah and then you have to go back
[1746.48 --> 1750.16]  and do side quests which feels horrible and then there's other games where you don't have to do side
[1750.16 --> 1754.56]  quests at all and they like kind of aren't very good because they weren't designed for you to do all of
[1754.56 --> 1760.00]  them so then you're like oh this sucks when you should have just been doing the main quest it's yeah
[1760.00 --> 1766.56]  it's kind of weird ran into that a few times recently so i have experienced a ton of instability
[1766.56 --> 1775.12]  and it really raises questions for me about the qc that's going into verified games right because i have
[1775.12 --> 1785.44]  no doubt that if i was sony right i would be not that happy to have you know my name flash up as a
[1785.44 --> 1793.28]  splash screen on this verified title on some verified console like you think about how defensive companies
[1793.28 --> 1800.24]  are of their image yeah i mean the this verified badge horizon zero dawn on windows when it was just
[1800.24 --> 1805.68]  like a broken piece of trash that's fair but they fixed it apparently maybe yeah yeah people in the
[1805.68 --> 1811.20]  chat are saying yeah it was a joke at launch but it's been it's been good i played it recently and it was
[1811.20 --> 1823.12]  fine okay um so i so there's definitely sensitivity around your product yeah being badged as works
[1823.12 --> 1831.04]  perfectly by someone else and then it doesn't and then you're kind of going okay because it's absolutely
[1831.04 --> 1836.08]  they will get messages about it oh hey why is your game such a buggy mess on steam deck it's verified what
[1836.08 --> 1843.28]  did you guys do yeah someone will yeah and i just i feel like i feel like with how many titles valve is
[1843.28 --> 1849.44]  verifying they might be going a little yolo and a little rubber stampy because my experience with
[1849.44 --> 1857.12]  horizon zero dawn was that i went five hours in with not a single hiccup and then after that it basically
[1857.12 --> 1861.52]  got worse and worse and worse and worse and worse they probably didn't you know test it all that much
[1861.52 --> 1867.76]  so they probably didn't like never mind play testing it they probably didn't play the whole game
[1867.76 --> 1874.96]  yeah and you can't you can't expect it's a fair amount to ask yeah you can't expect you know 20 hours
[1875.52 --> 1883.44]  in every game or even 10 hours in every game uh for valve to just you know be a charity and contribute
[1883.44 --> 1888.72]  that time to third-party developers title i was just gonna say now you have like whole game studio level
[1888.72 --> 1894.40]  qa departments just sitting there and playing right that's a weird thing for valve to hire at this
[1894.40 --> 1900.56]  point except maybe they should are they a console manufacturer now but i don't think console
[1900.56 --> 1905.68]  manufacturers do that that's on the game developers i'm sure they contribute some qa on their own i mean
[1905.68 --> 1911.60]  nintendo made the uh like nvidia style where they like employees into companies and stuff oh i'm i'm
[1911.60 --> 1916.08]  a hundred percent sure that they contribute to qa sure yeah yeah
[1920.24 --> 1927.44]  very interesting so i'm i'm antsy for mine dude i still don't have an email you can put windows on
[1927.44 --> 1933.76]  the steam deck but right now we shouldn't for a variety of reasons it looks like an utterly terrible
[1933.76 --> 1940.40]  idea which i think i think you nailed it earlier when you said well the silver lining i guess is this
[1940.40 --> 1947.84]  creates a small opening for those smaller companies that are trying to compete in the handheld pc
[1947.84 --> 1954.32]  space hopefully actually that small opening is bigger than what already existed before the steam deck
[1954.88 --> 1960.48]  came into play because steam deck is bringing so many eyes onto this medium because i think a ton of
[1960.48 --> 1967.44]  people didn't know or if you saw one you'd think it was just a gimmick yeah but now there's like this
[1967.44 --> 1973.04]  main line thing adding a bunch of legitimacy to the space and if you're like okay yeah but the game
[1973.04 --> 1978.24]  that i want to play is halo infinite or something that isn't on linux and then you see oh there's a
[1978.24 --> 1983.12]  windows option that actually looks fairly highly reviewed yet maybe they'll get it yeah it could be i
[1983.12 --> 1989.36]  mean uh actually i haven't checked uh i and yo next i haven't checked in on their indiegogo
[1989.36 --> 1995.84]  um and i haven't heard from the i haven't heard from the ceo lately they've uh they've got 382 backers
[1995.84 --> 2002.32]  and they raised three quarters uh 700 000 canadians so that's about 550 us just over a half a million
[2002.32 --> 2009.68]  dollars us so yeah not bad not bad i mean i guarantee you it's not steam deck numbers but it's not bad
[2009.68 --> 2016.32]  uh chino chibi says nintendo seal of quality is worthless i think it is now but when they used to be
[2016.32 --> 2021.52]  primo when they first introduced it it was a big deal it was one of the things that nintendo did to
[2021.52 --> 2029.04]  set themselves apart from just the gaming crash that took place before the nes took hold uh which
[2029.04 --> 2036.88]  was to keep low quality repetitive crappy games off of their platform they even uh they even enforced
[2036.88 --> 2043.12]  a limit to how many games a publisher was allowed to submit per year just to ensure that they wouldn't
[2043.12 --> 2050.64]  just shart out more games yeah yeah try to make it up in volume you know and they would even it wasn't
[2050.64 --> 2056.64]  even just technical validation they would even offer gameplay suggestions say like hey you should do this
[2056.64 --> 2061.84]  and you should do that if you if you want the game to be better it used to be really intense yeah
[2062.56 --> 2068.16]  yeah i that i don't know talk about it like pretty often yeah i haven't heard it brought up in forever i
[2068.16 --> 2073.52]  don't know anything about it now yeah me neither uh we should probably bring up merch messages as
[2073.52 --> 2080.56]  well as the new feature yeah that we are launching on ltt store so we don't have any new products this
[2080.56 --> 2085.44]  week so still the cable ties that we talked about last week lots of different colors these are actually
[2085.44 --> 2090.56]  selling really really well they're a way better deal than they used to be and there's a ton more variety
[2090.56 --> 2097.04]  also eco-friendly packaging but i love the packaging what we're doing this week is announcing actually you
[2097.04 --> 2102.08]  know what luke you should announce it because your team worked on this it's the bonus bin made by the
[2102.08 --> 2107.92]  same guy that made merch messages which makes sense uh but if you add something to cart uh you can now
[2107.92 --> 2114.80]  see the bonus bin i'm sharing thing at the top oh yep okay sweet um and there's a kind of what is going
[2114.80 --> 2120.96]  to be a rotating set of things that you can decide individually uh to add to your cart for free in the
[2120.96 --> 2126.64]  past i believe you guys had sticker packs yep um now there's two different sticker packs the 2021 one or
[2126.64 --> 2134.00]  the 2022 one and the gpu wasteland postcard um the postcards currently says post dot dot dot so we
[2134.00 --> 2139.60]  should probably have some word wrap there or something but um yeah it's there it's cool uh
[2139.60 --> 2144.24]  we're like i said we're gonna add some rotating stuff in the future so there'll be new things that
[2144.24 --> 2148.80]  show up here um and you don't have to add it if you don't want it but it's just a cool little thing
[2148.80 --> 2155.12]  that you get for free there's stuff in here uh and there's stuff planned to be in here in the future
[2155.12 --> 2161.60]  that are like not necessarily cheap from some people um like yeah we're gonna talk about having
[2161.60 --> 2166.64]  pins and stuff yeah i want to do things like that's not a small item so yeah maybe check out
[2166.64 --> 2170.64]  the bonus i can tell you they don't cost much so anyone who's charging you a ton of money for a pin
[2170.64 --> 2176.24]  is i see them go for like 15 bucks i'm not into pins but there's people that like collect like tons
[2176.24 --> 2183.60]  of pins i don't know i don't know um but yeah i mean i'll happily charge 15 for them do you guys
[2183.60 --> 2188.72]  do you guys want them in the bonus bin or should i charge 15 for them because i'm down i'm down i can
[2188.72 --> 2195.76]  tell you there's a lot of margin in it at 15. i bet i just i just know i've seen it for like around
[2195.76 --> 2202.72]  that amount but yeah bonus bin super cool um i would strongly encourage you guys to uh do the
[2202.72 --> 2210.56]  gpu wasteland postcard and then send it to us our address is on google maps and the idea is that if
[2210.56 --> 2217.84]  people get these color them or otherwise decorate them and then send them back to us we want to
[2217.84 --> 2223.44]  decorate a wall in the new creator warehouse space with these gpu wasteland postcards so we can all
[2223.44 --> 2232.48]  remember the glory days of 2020 to 2022. maybe glory is not the right word that's a little uh you know
[2233.52 --> 2247.52]  um the glory days hey there you go um but yeah it should be good 15 let's go for 50. indeed indubitably
[2247.52 --> 2255.76]  you should have you should make like one like pure gold pin yeah we'll make it a loot box so you won't
[2255.76 --> 2263.36]  know yeah you won't know if you're gonna get like a a tin one or a gold one people jokingly bring up in
[2263.36 --> 2269.52]  floatplane meetings every once in a while that we should have loot boxes for emotes so it's just a
[2269.52 --> 2278.16]  random a random emote which is horrible just completely terrible um but yeah why don't we talk
[2278.16 --> 2282.64]  about apple's peak performance event well should we do a couple of merch messages uh oh sure yeah
[2282.64 --> 2290.40]  yeah some curated ones hi linus i have to get all new network gear for my house long story and we'll
[2290.40 --> 2300.00]  soon get 10 gig internet really that's uh that's intense okay that's really intense i'm considering
[2300.00 --> 2305.92]  ubiquity's unify ecosystem do you have any gripes or regrets with your system are there any alternatives
[2305.92 --> 2313.04]  you'd recommend we've been pretty happy with unify gear at the office here and that includes everything
[2313.04 --> 2320.16]  from their access points to their switches we have definitely run into some speed bumps but it should
[2320.16 --> 2326.88]  be noted that apparently the square ap's that i got way back in the day were just notoriously awful
[2326.88 --> 2333.36]  they were like the worst product ubiquity ever made and so the fact that i that was my first unify
[2333.36 --> 2340.56]  experience was i picked up three of those and tried to you know do up my house and it was just it was it
[2340.56 --> 2349.76]  was terrible i remember that and i ended up going ruckus after the fact um so i've had some bad
[2349.76 --> 2356.88]  experiences but a lot of it has been caused by us often using early access unified gear where the
[2356.88 --> 2364.48]  hardware is baked but the software is not done yet so yes we've run into issues but man when you want
[2364.48 --> 2372.08]  bang for the buck prosumer network gear what would you i mean what would you compare it to you pretty
[2372.08 --> 2377.28]  much kind of come down to ubiquity yeah microtech is pretty sick if you're if you want to get down and
[2377.28 --> 2384.48]  dirty and you want to you want to get nerdy and um other than that like what like most of the big
[2384.48 --> 2390.88]  guys these days want subscription fees for everything and ubiquity is still providing a lot of the same
[2391.60 --> 2397.68]  software and monitoring and tools but there's no subscription you just buy the hardware and you get
[2397.68 --> 2408.72]  access to that so yeah i would say i would say ubiquity is a is a an 8.75 out of 10 recommend from me we
[2408.72 --> 2414.72]  actually just rolled some new ubiquity gear between here and one of the new satellite offices right
[2416.24 --> 2426.48]  we were up on the roof okay but we are getting uh greater than gigabit speeds between the two and
[2426.48 --> 2433.60]  and sub one millisecond latency accessing machines that are in a completely different building
[2434.16 --> 2442.08]  on the same land that's so we don't get any of the security and overhead issues involved in doing
[2442.08 --> 2450.48]  like a vpn from one location to the next no like no no encryption overhead is this a static installation
[2450.48 --> 2454.80]  like you're leaving it there yeah oh that's just straight over the air that's really cool yeah i'm
[2454.80 --> 2465.28]  really excited that's awesome super cool uh oh what am i looking at here oh click to view more oh oh
[2465.28 --> 2471.84]  there's a new interface here uh oh landon everything including gaming hardware is getting more expensive
[2471.84 --> 2476.40]  fast with things like steam deck and laptops getting more and more powerful what does an entry-level setup
[2476.40 --> 2481.52]  look like in five to ten years will gaming desktops eventually die out i mean that was part of the idea
[2481.52 --> 2490.16]  behind me daily driving the steam deck for a month was to find out is this handheld which realistically
[2490.16 --> 2496.72]  has hardware in it that would have been gaming laptop grade only a few short years ago good enough
[2496.72 --> 2502.88]  to daily drive i think are we already there i think even if it's just for one day like it's a portable
[2502.88 --> 2510.16]  device you should use it at work as your work computer yeah it's just a lot of software crap to figure out
[2510.16 --> 2517.36]  to use for one day that's probably fair i just i feel like have you done like any actual personal
[2517.36 --> 2523.20]  computing on it has it just been games i've only gamed yeah like i feel like you're gonna get to the
[2523.20 --> 2528.16]  end of this and have done no personal computing and that's like a pretty important part of well
[2528.16 --> 2533.52]  what's my boss gonna do get mad at me i just mean i'll just extend the video i'll extend the challenge
[2533.52 --> 2538.00]  another 30 days and i'll like force myself to do it if i feel like it i mean don't do that because you
[2538.00 --> 2542.56]  you gotta come back and play halo you've seen how stuck on horizon zero dawn i've been lately yeah
[2542.56 --> 2548.48]  i'm like constantly in there yeah and i feel left out because every time i'm on steam i'm the the
[2548.48 --> 2553.20]  bottom right-handed caltane is playing eldenry burnt banana is playing everyone's just i haven't played
[2553.20 --> 2557.84]  it yet everyone's just playing elden everyone's playing elden rings and i'm like i picked i picked
[2557.84 --> 2563.28]  completely the not trendy open world game to play oh what i have no idea what i'm doing
[2566.00 --> 2573.92]  oh man but yeah i i think it's entirely possible at the price of the steam deck it's the best computer
[2573.92 --> 2580.96]  you can buy for 400 hands down oh yeah i'd say go for it absolutely especially because you can't even
[2580.96 --> 2589.36]  get a desktop computer with a gpu in it for 400 yeah hey linus asks joshua how did the twitch chat is
[2589.36 --> 2597.28]  awful things start and why be so mean to twitch viewers well that's actually a really interesting
[2597.28 --> 2602.88]  story and to answer it we kind of have to go way back to before it was twitch tv we have to go all the
[2602.88 --> 2609.44]  way back to when it was justin.tv and rather than being a game focused site it was actually more focused
[2609.44 --> 2618.64]  on like uh bootleg live shows and uh sporting events yeah and um pretty much everyone was toxic
[2618.64 --> 2628.16]  and awful and i made the astute observation that as a community they are toxic and awful and um they
[2628.16 --> 2636.48]  never changed nice yeah yeah twitch chat i love you you're awful yeah that's a really good i i love you
[2636.48 --> 2642.88]  you're awful is a wonderful way of saying that yeah yeah twitch prime by the way uh also any updates
[2642.88 --> 2649.28]  on backpack screwdriver or short circuit hoodie no i have no updates other than soon soon
[2652.64 --> 2655.52]  uh we'll do one more and then let's jump into the apple event
[2658.00 --> 2661.44]  no idea how to pronounce that been watching for years love your hot takes oh thanks
[2662.32 --> 2669.20]  what do you think about hardware vpns slash decentralized vpns saw a video from unbox therapy
[2669.20 --> 2678.72]  and i'm not sure about the privacy aspect ah yes i saw that video from unbox therapy as well
[2678.72 --> 2685.52]  and it's something that's been on our radar basically what it is is the idea that i think i pitched to you
[2685.52 --> 2691.04]  on wan show at some point i either pitched it to you on wan show or i've talked about it internally
[2691.04 --> 2699.12]  like oh wouldn't that be a really cool way to do a vpn where basically everyone is um it's kind of like
[2699.12 --> 2704.64]  how yeah everyone's a node and it's kind of like how windows is our windows it's kind of like how microsoft
[2704.64 --> 2711.44]  is rolling windows updates now where you contribute to the network to make sure that you know okay say luke
[2711.44 --> 2716.80]  and i live in the same apartment building rather than him downloading off of a microsoft server in
[2716.80 --> 2721.92]  redmond obviously that's not typically how it would be that microsoft would have the files cached on a
[2721.92 --> 2728.00]  data center closer to luke but rather than pulling the files out of a data center he would just grab them
[2728.64 --> 2735.52]  in as few hops as possible from a newer node like me in order to accelerate download speeds as well as
[2735.52 --> 2740.40]  reduce latency and overall internet congestion it's actually like a win-win-win
[2740.40 --> 2746.80]  to have multiple nodes for downloads rather than centralized servers in in some cases like we've
[2746.80 --> 2752.56]  seen situations where a major gaming launch has dragged the internet down to a crawl and that
[2752.56 --> 2758.32]  wouldn't have necessarily had to happen with a decentralized file distribution system like uh
[2758.32 --> 2766.80]  like bit like bit torrent for example um so the product that lou was taking a look at
[2766.80 --> 2773.68]  was pretty much the idea that i had talked about before where instead of being for file distribution
[2774.24 --> 2784.88]  these nodes were for um internet access from that location what's really cool about this approach is
[2784.88 --> 2789.60]  that by contributing a little bit of your bandwidth and many people have unlimited data plans these days
[2789.60 --> 2794.96]  by contributing some of your bandwidth and some of your both download and upload speed right because the
[2794.96 --> 2801.52]  traffic has to come all the way through you are gaining access to other users in other regions
[2802.24 --> 2809.28]  who are contributing their bandwidth to you so that you can access services and uh and websites as
[2809.28 --> 2815.84]  though you are from that region just like a vpn would but what gives it a big advantage over a traditional vpn
[2815.84 --> 2823.84]  is that service providers are constantly trying to block vpns from accessing their services and there's
[2823.84 --> 2829.76]  a hundred reasons that might exist for this whether it's authoritarian regimes that don't want access to
[2829.76 --> 2835.92]  outside information coming across their borders or whether it's companies that have complicated licensing
[2835.92 --> 2842.00]  agreements that allow them to display content in one country but not in another country because the internet
[2842.00 --> 2849.60]  doesn't exist in their world view um there are lots of reasons why they will aggressively pursue
[2849.60 --> 2855.68]  these users who are accessing their content from another region because in some cases it can open them
[2855.68 --> 2861.68]  up to serious legal liability if they are found to be not doing their due diligence to enforce the terms
[2861.68 --> 2868.48]  of their license and so there's this constant game of whack-a-mole where vpn providers are trying to find ways
[2868.48 --> 2877.12]  to use safe non-blocked ips that are registered to that region and service providers are trying to find
[2877.12 --> 2885.12]  ways to play whack-a-mole and ban ip blocks that are associated with these vpn services and it's at the
[2885.12 --> 2890.48]  point now where a company like shadow tech you remember shadow tech they had like gaming servers
[2890.48 --> 2894.16]  they're still around in data centers i don't know if they're still doing it but they they were for a
[2894.16 --> 2900.96]  while anyway and then they had a whole like insolvency thing but shadow tech um had the challenge of
[2900.96 --> 2908.16]  trying to find a way to get their like they actually had to work through services like netflix to get
[2908.16 --> 2918.16]  their ip blocks unbanned because it got to the point where service providers just basically said okay we're
[2918.16 --> 2928.24]  just going to just block list every ip that's associated with a data center because any commercial
[2928.24 --> 2933.52]  vpn service that is running out of a data center is going to be on these ip blocks and really there's
[2933.52 --> 2940.40]  no reason that you know some cloud server for some infrastructure is going to need to watch movies on
[2940.40 --> 2947.28]  netflix anyway so the fact that there were consumers using these these data center ips was a challenge that
[2947.28 --> 2952.16]  they had to solve and it was as simple as getting netflix to allow them they were just they just had
[2952.16 --> 2959.12]  to demonstrate that it was not inordinate use coming through this ip which is pretty trivial for
[2959.12 --> 2965.20]  them to detect okay you know five people or whatever the amount they allow per account it could not
[2965.20 --> 2973.36]  possibly be watching this much bridgerton or whatever right um and where was i going with this right
[2973.36 --> 2979.12]  right right right so the advantage is that by having all of these nodes it becomes extremely
[2979.12 --> 2986.96]  difficult to play that game of whack-a-mole efficiently right to just mass ban anything that
[2986.96 --> 2992.24]  could possibly be associated with a commercial service and move on to the next thing and because
[2992.88 --> 3000.64]  theoretically if the network gets large enough that traffic could be spread out so much it would be
[3000.64 --> 3006.08]  it would be really hard for them to even detect it through like a brute force method like looking
[3006.08 --> 3011.12]  at how much use is coming through it and and blocking that ip now they could get aggressive and start
[3011.12 --> 3017.60]  trying to to to block everything that they suspect is a multiple user but they'd end up irking a lot of
[3017.60 --> 3023.04]  customers and now that netflix charges so much you don't want to you don't want to create friction with
[3023.04 --> 3030.56]  your legitimate paying customer right so any overly aggressive attempt to curb undesirable behavior
[3030.64 --> 3036.72]  like hosting a vpn that other users are tunneling through that runs the risk of causing people
[3036.72 --> 3041.52]  to cancel your service which doesn't look great on your you know quarterly revenue reports because
[3041.52 --> 3045.92]  you're a public company right i mean there's a lot of places where there isn't really isp competition
[3047.12 --> 3052.56]  that's that's fair especially in the states but i meant for netflix people could cancel that service
[3052.56 --> 3060.80]  yeah yeah and that's not a good look yeah um winter says just use a pia static ip and generate a new
[3060.80 --> 3066.32]  one each month that service that pia offers if i recall does it cost more i can't remember uh but
[3066.32 --> 3075.92]  that service that pia offers is difficult to maintain finding new especially ipv4 ips these days
[3075.92 --> 3082.48]  it's not well it's easy but it's not cheap yeah is what i will is what i will say about that
[3084.16 --> 3093.20]  i don't know there's there's so the downside yeah all of your internet traffic is going through some
[3094.16 --> 3104.48]  midpoint that you do not control kind of same vice versa on that coin theoretically theoretically there's a
[3104.48 --> 3113.20]  a bunch of you are encrypting it before it goes through but my understanding is that there's no
[3113.20 --> 3119.68]  way to encrypt what comes back to you yeah um
[3122.56 --> 3129.20]  yeah i mean almost everything is https now like it's there's still some that isn't though you're right
[3129.20 --> 3131.92]  it's there's still some that's a lot of people who are in the states especially like government websites
[3131.92 --> 3138.24]  which i find very funny um low level like uh municipal government websites i find a lot of them
[3138.24 --> 3149.36]  kind of still aren't um i don't know i i've read some stuff that apparently like certain uh what are they
[3149.36 --> 3155.92]  called deeper or whatever uh deeper network apparently i don't know i've read some stuff on this i i wasn't
[3155.92 --> 3161.84]  prepared for this topic so i'm sorry um but i've read that they're they're looking to being more open
[3161.84 --> 3167.12]  about certain things not that they've necessarily been notably closed off about certain things but
[3167.12 --> 3172.08]  they're they're interested in being more open about certain things like it's it i don't know it could be
[3172.08 --> 3178.56]  very interesting it's a little sketch though in my opinion i'm gonna maybe invite a surprise guest to
[3178.56 --> 3185.68]  the show let's see if he picks up uh hey dan you're um wait i forget is it dan or danny dan's good
[3185.68 --> 3192.40]  great um you're on the wan show so you're you're live right now i was talking about how ipv4 addresses
[3192.40 --> 3197.92]  are getting i won't say difficult to obtain but certainly expensive to obtain and we've had some
[3197.92 --> 3203.20]  people in the chat kind of saying well they can't be that expensive uh you know surely you know you
[3203.20 --> 3208.40]  could afford them easily linus but i remember the last time i talked to you about this being just
[3208.40 --> 3215.52]  utterly blown away by how expensive it was for a block of ipv4 addresses and i was wondering if
[3215.52 --> 3222.00]  you'd be willing to kind of give us the the latest on that yeah it's about 50 bucks us and ip right now
[3222.00 --> 3230.72]  buying in bulk per ip and that's up from a year ago about 24 and that's that's you know finite resource
[3230.72 --> 3238.08]  rapidly depleted and the price is raising by almost 100 a year so you're saying that if i wanted to
[3238.08 --> 3246.00]  invest instead of vancouver real estate i should actually buy ipv4 addresses you could you'd have
[3246.00 --> 3252.88]  to get an asn and you know be an isp and then get a rin to let you have an allocation and then you
[3252.88 --> 3258.64]  could go buy them but you could do that okay but you'd sort that out for me right sure okay all right
[3258.64 --> 3263.44]  all right cool uh thanks dan good chat i guess we haven't talked in a long time but that means the
[3263.44 --> 3269.84]  service is working well so that's a good thing um yeah good to hear no problem all right talk to you
[3269.84 --> 3277.44]  later man yeah have a good one okay bye um that that's itel our isp is amazing um i don't know if
[3277.44 --> 3283.68]  everyone gets the same kind of service but i can literally call up their cto pretty much whatever i
[3283.68 --> 3288.96]  want and ask them stuff uh so they've they've helped us do some really really cool stuff with our connection
[3288.96 --> 3293.68]  we pay dearly for the service yeah uh and i'm not sure how much sense it's going to make forever
[3293.68 --> 3298.40]  hopefully he doesn't watch this because telus now has two and a half gig residential connections
[3298.40 --> 3306.48]  just like bond a couple of those probably fine but anyway the point is yeah 50 freaking bucks yeah
[3308.24 --> 3315.60]  we have to get ips for flow plane right so it's a lot of freaking money yeah and that's bulk yeah do you
[3315.60 --> 3319.36]  oh do you know how much we pay through flow plane because we're buying it much lower volumes than
[3319.36 --> 3325.44]  them uh i mean i could figure it out yeah it's okay don't don't worry too much about it though but um
[3326.88 --> 3331.84]  oh crap what was i gonna say yeah just everything's getting worse like you you know we're working on the
[3331.84 --> 3339.12]  the infrastructure 2.0 stuff servers that we want to get for that like when we first started working
[3339.12 --> 3344.08]  with ovh you probably even remember this i would procure a server and it would be up in like minutes
[3345.60 --> 3349.68]  super fast some of the stuff that we're getting now is like we're getting them to customize the
[3349.68 --> 3353.52]  hardware and stuff so yeah that's gonna take a moment longer yeah but like you expect okay maybe
[3353.52 --> 3360.56]  you know tomorrow or something right now it's like hmm not sure might be done by the end of the month
[3361.52 --> 3367.68]  yeah like oh man heart like everything in that space is just getting so rough it makes sense though
[3367.68 --> 3373.68]  with like i mean we've had chip shortage for going on for so long now and so many things are going
[3373.68 --> 3380.08]  online and the online space is just massively exploding as it has been for years so yeah i don't
[3380.08 --> 3385.60]  know it's interesting how much the internet has changed even in the last 10 years because like yeah
[3385.60 --> 3392.48]  sure it's existed but the amount the the degree to which it's ubiquitous at this point is it's web 3.0 now
[3395.04 --> 3401.60]  it's the metaverse have we talked about this on the show how painful is it for you someone who
[3401.60 --> 3407.20]  participated in wow classic like wow vanilla i shouldn't say classic i should say wow vanilla
[3409.36 --> 3418.72]  like in a big way in the community of wow vanilla how painful is it for you to have what you did and
[3418.72 --> 3427.52]  lived through over 10 years ago co-opted into a marketing term that for something that makes no
[3427.52 --> 3433.20]  sense and it's been driving me nuts i i i don't know if we've talked about this too much i know i
[3433.20 --> 3440.48]  think i brought up on wanshow before but what is it i don't know it's not anything how are you
[3440.48 --> 3444.96]  start you just talking about this you're like oh yeah we're gonna work on the metaverse what is it
[3445.52 --> 3450.72]  what's the metaverse because it's not one thing that's been the crazy thing for me like yeah facebook
[3450.72 --> 3457.12]  is making something sure but not everyone's just going to use facebook's thing so then
[3458.00 --> 3464.48]  it's not one thing then like what what are you doing oh man it's driving me nuts there's no like
[3464.48 --> 3470.48]  centralized one service and no one's ever going to be wants to be it it's not going to happen and no
[3470.48 --> 3475.44]  one's ever going to be cool with that you think microsoft's just going to be chill that like facebook
[3475.44 --> 3482.40]  owns the entire metaverse no that's not going to happen i just god it's been driving me so nuts
[3483.28 --> 3491.20]  oh there's like there's no there's there's one buzzword and no plan at all but there's so much
[3491.20 --> 3496.24]  money being poured into this thing that just like doesn't oh we should just change our our name to
[3496.24 --> 3505.04]  linus metaverse group uh i mean you could it wouldn't and then go ipo be like yeah we're working on we're
[3505.04 --> 3512.56]  working on educational content for the metaverse first we had text then we had pictures then we had
[3512.56 --> 3520.16]  video in the future we'll have lmg content whatever you want to call it yeah you got to call it something
[3520.16 --> 3524.80]  yeah it's like choose it's choose your own adventure information delivery in the metaverse never been
[3524.80 --> 3532.48]  done before yeah yeah we should do it we should totally do it so we we do we do like we do um uh uh
[3532.48 --> 3540.72]  what are what are they called uh vtuber we do vtuber linus okay yes and we do like uh because because
[3540.72 --> 3545.76]  you can totally do this with animation software you record the voiceover and it just automatically
[3545.76 --> 3551.36]  syncs the gum flapping yeah yeah yeah um i honestly i i've talked i've talked about this before if i was
[3551.36 --> 3559.04]  smart okay i would be vtuber transitioning now so it's a video but like the whole background is transparency
[3559.04 --> 3564.08]  so it's you you you host it on like a green screen but it's a vtuber so whatever but everything other
[3564.08 --> 3568.88]  than the vtuber is a green screen yeah and the green screen is just what's actually in front of you and
[3568.88 --> 3575.12]  so when you're wearing ar glasses you just have like the little vtuber in the corner yeah and metaverse
[3575.12 --> 3582.00]  linus sits and like talks to you yeah about and then and then we we build a software team like an ai
[3582.00 --> 3589.20]  machine learning software team so that you can ask for tech tips and metaverse linus will give you tech tips
[3589.20 --> 3592.24]  and it's basically bonsai buddy and you can you can
[3593.84 --> 3599.20]  or like there's an old reference like microsoft paperclip so you can have like what's that what's
[3599.20 --> 3604.00]  that burger place in taiwan that you don't like moss burger oh it's disgusting okay so you can have
[3604.00 --> 3608.48]  it so that when you're walking out with your ar glasses what do you think of this restaurant line
[3608.48 --> 3613.92]  look at moss burger linus can be like it's not good you shouldn't go there because blah blah blah blah
[3615.92 --> 3624.48]  metaverse linus linus metagroup oh man i'm ready what metaverse i'm so ready well it doesn't matter
[3625.12 --> 3632.08]  because you just raise vc money from people who have more so much money that making more of it is just a
[3632.08 --> 3638.08]  game like it's it's like i remember when we reached a point in our business and i i still don't
[3638.08 --> 3643.52]  behave like this personally but when it comes to the business we reached a point where our budgeting
[3643.52 --> 3651.60]  changed when we started out our budgeting was based on how many dollars and cents um we have in our bank
[3651.60 --> 3660.56]  account yeah that was how we budgeted and at some point it changed and it changed to k's we just we
[3660.56 --> 3666.24]  stopped talking in terms of dollars and we started talking in terms of k's okay this new salary is going
[3666.24 --> 3674.32]  to be this many k's and the expected roi stages you go to m's we're not going to m's i could i can tell
[3674.32 --> 3680.96]  you that i'm just saying some people do actually oh we do have some m level projects yeah we're not
[3680.96 --> 3686.08]  gonna we're not gonna get there though we're we're we're we're we're a k's driven company yeah so we
[3686.08 --> 3692.00]  reached a point where it started to become okay uh this is the outlay in case and this is the expected
[3692.00 --> 3698.64]  return in case over some period of time x and that started to be how we thought about things and
[3699.52 --> 3707.28]  for your vcs where it's just you know the you don't actually think about anything in terms of whether you
[3707.28 --> 3713.92]  can afford it or not you're just thinking about it in terms of m's and percentage uplift year over
[3713.92 --> 3722.00]  year it's just like growing the dragon horde right uh there's just so much money flying around
[3723.12 --> 3730.48]  that it's it's just it's one fad after another yeah and it's just it's bizarre to me it's like
[3730.48 --> 3737.20]  the it's like the no one remembers the dot-com bubble ever happened you see the winners right they won
[3737.20 --> 3742.32]  another one you see the amazon that came out of the dot-com bubble did anybody else emerge from the dot-com
[3742.32 --> 3751.36]  bubble well yeah probably but like that yeah no no i was looking at who was i looking at that like
[3751.36 --> 3757.04]  still hadn't recovered their dot it was like a major major company that still hadn't restored their
[3757.04 --> 3763.52]  they're like like fortune fortune 500 but still were not valued the way they were in the dot-com bubble
[3763.52 --> 3769.20]  i don't know like there's not many companies uh paypal ebay are a couple that people yeah okay
[3769.20 --> 3775.20]  there there are some that did but it's like a handful the number that went just completely
[3775.20 --> 3782.64]  disappeared with all trace of any money put into them vanished in a flurry of herman miller chairs on
[3782.64 --> 3792.08]  craigslist like what do you want james when you want nothing he wants for nothing ladies and gentlemen
[3792.08 --> 3796.96]  i'll have a licorice thank you oh i don't want the whole thing oh there's not that many okay yeah
[3796.96 --> 3802.00]  that's fine i accept it then you want a licorice take a single one all right heck yeah i haven't eaten
[3802.00 --> 3813.20]  on wancho in forever this might work this is great um it's a metaverse yeah all right it's just
[3813.76 --> 3818.48]  it's actually it actually triggers me there are there aren't that many things that just can immediately set
[3818.48 --> 3824.48]  me off but whenever i see anything talking about metaverse i just i flip because like there's this
[3824.48 --> 3833.12]  there's just nothing there what are you talking about nfts at least like at least that has a clear
[3834.24 --> 3842.40]  the like yeah it's total bs but at least it's clear what the bs is trying to do it's horse armor
[3842.40 --> 3848.24]  yeah at least you get some armor for the horse i guess i don't know the the metaverse is just like
[3848.24 --> 3852.88]  remember the walmart thing was it walmart i think it was walmart the like walmart metaverse shopping
[3852.88 --> 3858.32]  experience video did you ever see that i didn't see it it's just like what is this where is this
[3858.32 --> 3865.12]  supposed to go like is this going facebook or is this just another vr application and if it's just
[3865.12 --> 3871.12]  another vr application why are you calling it metaverse it's just vr shopping which is completely fine
[3872.40 --> 3877.52]  like there's no problem with that that's i mean people were memeing on it because it's like weird
[3877.52 --> 3882.96]  to shop in walmart and vr and it's like yeah sure you know what i'm not going to defend that part but
[3882.96 --> 3888.08]  like it's it's whatever it's just a it's a vr thing maybe it becomes normal maybe it doesn't who cares
[3889.04 --> 3896.32]  but it's not meta like why why are we co-oping this this name from a book from quite a while ago which
[3896.32 --> 3901.36]  is apparently cool or whatever i haven't read it but apparently it's good and that's fine but why are we
[3901.36 --> 3906.80]  just co-oping this word for like something that facebook is potentially doing which sounds like
[3906.80 --> 3913.36]  uh zuckerberg is just going nuts and wants to spend money on something um and wanted to like shift
[3913.36 --> 3919.52]  attention from his company getting sued by everyone on the planet to just the stupidest name slash
[3919.52 --> 3923.84]  project that has like ever existed in the tech space in a long time i just yeah
[3923.84 --> 3930.96]  it actually just bothers me so much because it's nothing like like someone someone i watched
[3930.96 --> 3935.68]  someone talking about how i didn't think he was gonna go for this long sorry i watched someone
[3935.68 --> 3941.92]  talking about how uh mark must have never played vr chat yeah because like everything that they've
[3941.92 --> 3948.80]  tried to show off for facebook metaverse is just a bad version of vr chat and it's like yeah i completely
[3948.80 --> 3956.48]  agree i i know anyways sorry we can go talk about something else no i love it i'm having so much fun
[3956.48 --> 3961.60]  right now i mean it was already feeling like kind of a linus heavy episode and so i was like hmm
[3962.56 --> 3968.80]  you know what i said i just i haven't i haven't played with steam deck right so i can't really say
[3968.80 --> 3977.04]  a lot about it i know it's great okay i will defend one aspect of the metaverse to you okay you have
[3977.04 --> 3985.68]  to try not to bite my head off about it sure if they achieve some level of interoperability okay so
[3986.80 --> 3997.28]  if facebook's metaverse where you are you are like crossplay sure where there's a cafe in the in the
[3997.28 --> 4004.48]  mcdonald's in the walmart or there's a there's a seating area stop stop okay so there's a seating area
[4004.48 --> 4017.92]  in the the walmart's mcdonald's where you can sit stop where you can where you can sit
[4017.92 --> 4023.60]  and you can pull up your vr sorry metaverse phone
[4025.84 --> 4030.00]  and call one of your facebook contacts probably your aunt
[4032.80 --> 4036.16]  there won't be anyone young it's the only reason why anyone uses facebook anymore
[4036.16 --> 4045.36]  extended family and then they appear and you could you and your metaverse avatars could leave what an
[4045.36 --> 4051.76]  amazing there okay you leave there you go into the walmart and you help her pick out a tv
[4052.88 --> 4062.48]  okay in the metaverse and then the tv arrives at her house okay if there's some kind of movement
[4063.20 --> 4073.68]  between between like these islands of experiences then it will be compelling but and you can mark my
[4073.68 --> 4079.28]  words here was that you guys met at mcdonald's and went to walmart the movement was the integration
[4079.28 --> 4085.44]  between multiple platforms okay so the multiple platforms is mcdonald's and walmart so walmart has
[4085.44 --> 4091.28]  contributed their layout of their store and their product selection and shopping experience and
[4091.28 --> 4098.88]  mcdonald's has contributed creating meetup places and they have engaged with facebook to have integration
[4098.88 --> 4104.80]  for your contacts so that you can meet and make recommendations to each other so this is part of
[4104.80 --> 4111.28]  my core problem but you can mark my words that will never happen and this is part of my core problem
[4111.28 --> 4116.40]  is like what what you're kind of talking about is almost apps working with each other on a platform
[4116.40 --> 4122.64]  and facebook metaverse is the platform yeah but no one's gonna let that happen yeah i know without
[4122.64 --> 4127.52]  having competing platforms and so like yes that might be a thing it's gonna be smart homes all over again
[4127.52 --> 4132.40]  yeah so yes that might be a thing maybe there's gonna be competing platforms right so microsoft
[4132.40 --> 4138.80]  has one amazon has one facebook has one google has one apple has one everyone under the netflix somehow
[4138.80 --> 4145.84]  finds a way to insert themselves um whatever then there's gonna be the the walmart shopping experience
[4145.84 --> 4152.16]  for all of those and the microsoft meetup or sorry the mcdonald's meetup experience for all of those
[4152.16 --> 4160.96]  videos but you still have people stuck on other metaverses or you know versions of vr chat whatever
[4160.96 --> 4169.20]  you want to call it uh and so like what's the point i just keep coming back to like why because we
[4169.20 --> 4175.04]  already have this problem where there's okay we have vr but some people are on index and some people are on
[4175.04 --> 4180.08]  oculus and some people are on different versions of oculus so they can't run the same thing and yeah some
[4180.08 --> 4185.04]  people are playing uh beat saber but some people have custom beat saber so they can play custom
[4185.04 --> 4188.72]  songs and other people don't and like there's already these problems and it's just going to
[4188.72 --> 4194.96]  fragment it even more and developing something for v metaverse doesn't mean anything because there isn't one
[4196.72 --> 4202.56]  and i just keep coming back to that core problem it's like okay this this app transferability the the
[4202.56 --> 4209.52]  cross play whatever it doesn't matter because there isn't one metaverse chasing saul says
[4210.08 --> 4215.04]  metaverse is entirely a method of removing money from someone else and giving it to someone else yeah
[4215.84 --> 4226.32]  uh this is uh this this xkcd comic um is basically it in a nutshell some of you guys go go go buy the
[4226.32 --> 4233.52]  book go buy their book or something because technically this is their copyrighted comic and we're being bad
[4233.52 --> 4238.48]  right now um but but help help us make sure that they get some money i don't see a donate
[4239.20 --> 4243.76]  i wanted to donate but i don't see a donate link on the thing so you guys can also throw in the chat but
[4243.76 --> 4252.16]  this is amazing this is it in a nutshell how standards proliferate yes ac chargers character encodings
[4252.16 --> 4260.00]  instant messaging etc situation there are 14 competing standards 14 ridiculous we need to develop one universal
[4260.00 --> 4267.44]  standard that covers everyone's use cases yeah soon situation there are 15 competing standards and that
[4267.44 --> 4276.16]  yep is why the metaverse will never happen oh apparently it's creative commons uh attribution so i'm good
[4276.80 --> 4283.36]  heck yeah thank you xkcd you go buy their book anyways yeah do it anyway yeah people gotta eat all right
[4283.36 --> 4289.92]  there's not even any ads on this page limit zero in full plane chat said uh just make metaverse an
[4289.92 --> 4295.36]  industry standard of intercompatibility so your steam vr avatar is working oculus etc no they they won't
[4295.36 --> 4300.72]  yeah but that's the comic i just showed you yeah someone else will want to own the platform yes and
[4300.72 --> 4305.20]  that's that's what i'm saying is the people at play right now are not going to allow it to be
[4305.20 --> 4309.84]  one system owned by one person and all those people at play are going to want to own the system
[4309.84 --> 4316.24]  because you're talking about like you were just talking about how we deal in k's you're talking
[4316.24 --> 4323.12]  about companies that deal in bees yes these guys want to own the whole thing yes because there will
[4323.12 --> 4328.72]  be lots more bees where they came from yeah i mean you're talking you're talking someone who literally
[4328.72 --> 4338.96]  is building a volcanic island fortress okay you're talking someone who is literally going to space yeah in
[4338.96 --> 4345.76]  a giant penis rocket for fun that would be trying to race each other that would be such a fun like
[4345.76 --> 4353.68]  saturday night live sketch like guess that billionaire they just say these like comically
[4354.40 --> 4360.80]  comically evil things that actual billionaires are actually doing or have done deconstruct a historical
[4360.80 --> 4365.92]  bridge to move their yacht yeah exactly build a new island that's an eye that's that's a duplicate one
[4365.92 --> 4371.84]  now there's more than one oh the the yacht no no no i mean uh i mean i was already uh i already had a
[4371.84 --> 4379.92]  bezos one oh yeah yeah yeah yeah he's just so easy i know he's so easy yeah actually looks like dr evil
[4383.92 --> 4395.52]  that'd be pretty good invaded a country yeah oh oh on that note oh yeah oh sponsors no no uh uh uh crosscode
[4395.52 --> 4401.04]  crosscode is part of the ukraine support bundle where is it oh that's cool it's one of my favorite
[4401.04 --> 4405.20]  games you guys should go buy it this is not i don't think it's part of the ukraine support bundle but i
[4405.20 --> 4411.20]  was going to stream uh and then i wasn't able to sorry i was busy uh but i was going to stream metro
[4411.20 --> 4417.92]  because metro this metro series of games is from a ukrainian developer and the publisher for it is doing
[4417.92 --> 4423.28]  this like huge supporting thing they donated like a million dollars or something it was it was huge
[4423.28 --> 4430.24]  they did i think they did 500 grand of their own money and then they did 500 grand of employee matched
[4430.24 --> 4436.32]  funds so i think if you include the employees it ends up being 1.5 million i think but i'm not certain
[4436.88 --> 4447.76]  okay rock paper shotgun has an article about it where is it itch.io is it still available yeah here it is
[4447.76 --> 4454.48]  okay so we're gonna throw this in the chat guys uh there's a ton of games in here just it's awesome
[4454.48 --> 4460.72]  one of my all-time favorites is crosscode it's a retro style action rpg whoa i didn't realize how many
[4460.72 --> 4468.40]  oh yeah 992 yeah what the heck yeah we're gonna have to wait can you can you change your contribution
[4468.40 --> 4472.72]  amount there's got to be a way to change your contribution amount oh yeah yeah yeah so i'll i'll
[4472.72 --> 4479.36]  i'll make sure that i buy buy it another copy of that game won't hurt and uh also support for ukraine
[4479.36 --> 4485.68]  can't hurt they've raised over 4.2 million dollars i guess i know they have a new game in the works uh
[4485.68 --> 4493.36]  ruui senpai i'm very excited because honestly the best way for me to describe crosscode is it's the game
[4493.36 --> 4500.48]  that i would have made if i stopped doing everything i was doing and started a game development studio and was
[4500.48 --> 4505.52]  good at it there's some really legit games in here by the way um i'm just like scrolling through really
[4505.52 --> 4513.12]  quick super hot if you enjoy fps games is just fantastic very unique um which is which is good
[4513.12 --> 4519.20]  in that universe there's there's lots of really tower falls great just lots of fun with the bros and
[4519.20 --> 4525.68]  broettes yeah uh what else we got in here let's let's pick some let's have some linus and luke's picks
[4525.68 --> 4530.16]  here as we as we go through here well there's celeste up above i scrolled past because i didn't
[4530.16 --> 4536.88]  know we were going to keep going but slashed is very good but you guys are going to want to come
[4536.88 --> 4543.20]  check this out for sure there's a lot of stuff i've never heard of which is fine makes sense there's a
[4543.20 --> 4550.00]  lot of games out there but i would buy it for crosscode alone super hot also i think that one's worth the
[4550.00 --> 4555.20]  price of admission alone have you played super hot in vr i have it's lots of fun it's so good
[4555.20 --> 4561.84]  yeah it's really fun save cracking simulator that's probably pretty cool might be terrible
[4561.84 --> 4566.96]  i haven't actually seen almost anything else that i recognize but i don't even care there's so many
[4566.96 --> 4570.08]  that it would take you so long to go through all of them anyways yeah
[4572.64 --> 4576.16]  there's a bunch of things in here that i've i've like come across them but i haven't played them
[4576.16 --> 4584.32]  myself hi name i'm dad how to be a dad in two simple steps okay that seems like it might be a
[4584.32 --> 4589.12]  bit of a stretch to call that a game but i don't again i don't know maybe you just showed out in
[4589.12 --> 4594.40]  chat if there's uh cool games in here that you would recommend people try out yeah for sure guys go have a
[4594.40 --> 4601.44]  look all right uh we should definitely do sponsor spots though you're right yeah also didn't i say we
[4601.44 --> 4606.56]  were going to start talking about the apple event and we just never did i think so okay yeah we will
[4606.56 --> 4616.80]  do that we will do that i promise um we are sponsored by jump cloud jump cloud is launching a
[4616.80 --> 4622.40]  new i.t community for i.t professionals when they talk about all where they talk about all things i.t
[4622.40 --> 4627.44]  and share best practices career guidance industry topics and jump cloud products they're creating a
[4627.44 --> 4630.88]  variety of guides and templates that are helpful for i.t admins in their everyday work
[4630.88 --> 4634.88]  as well as career spotlights for those in the field so you can watch for experts to join and
[4634.88 --> 4639.52]  provide even more value jump clouds i.t meetup network is also kicking off so you'll have
[4639.52 --> 4645.68]  opportunities to meet local colleagues and share virtually and in person now that in-person meetups
[4645.68 --> 4652.32]  are a thing yeah bc just removed the mask mandate last night at midnight so we are uh we officially
[4652.32 --> 4658.16]  removed ours here in the office today we're especially beard people are very excited about that
[4658.88 --> 4663.68]  it's been it's been rough so join jump cloud as they build one it community to rule them all at
[4663.68 --> 4669.76]  community.jumpcloud.com or at the link down below the show is also brought to you by vulture vulture
[4669.76 --> 4676.32]  offers high performance and easy to deploy cloud servers bare metal storage and managed kubernetes
[4676.32 --> 4681.20]  we use them for floatplane uh i think there was like a a comma here where it should have been a hyphen

[4771.20 --> 4777.76]  percent when you use the link in the video description we should talk about the apple event yeah
[4779.12 --> 4783.84]  i feel like the whole world already has yeah but in standard wan show fashion you get the news at the
[4783.84 --> 4790.32]  end of the week so you too can get a four thousand dollar computer with one terabyte of storage and i think
[4790.32 --> 4800.00]  it's a 20 core cpu and 64 gigs of ram so that's pretty cool for four thousand dollars that is a pretty
[4800.00 --> 4807.20]  special cpu the well the gpu is probably the specialist thing i mean nvidia and amd have been
[4807.20 --> 4815.60]  trying to bolt together two gpus with the same performance as a much larger gpu forever yeah basically
[4815.60 --> 4821.84]  forever i mean you could even go back all the way to uh 3dfx who nvidia acquired along with their
[4821.84 --> 4832.08]  together sli technology yeah and the m1 ultra does this by using a silicon interposer that connects
[4832.08 --> 4840.24]  across 10 000 plus signals providing two and a half terabytes per second of bandwidth that allows for a
[4840.24 --> 4848.96]  fusion architecture that is so fast that software will recognize these two discrete chips as one very
[4848.96 --> 4856.48]  cool which could just just completely change the game pun intended what few games you can play on apple
[4856.48 --> 4863.52]  silicon no seriously though that's so cool though yeah this no it actually is it's crazy if you guys
[4863.52 --> 4870.88]  haven't already uh ryan smith from anontech did uh did a good write-up on why this is so mind-blowing
[4870.88 --> 4878.24]  it didn't include any um one thing that i feel like was missing from it hey ryan if you're hi one
[4878.24 --> 4883.44]  one thing i feel was missing was some analysis of previous attempts and how much bandwidth was available
[4883.44 --> 4891.12]  between gpus uh so i would have liked to see him talk about how traditional sli was actually very low
[4891.12 --> 4896.00]  bandwidth it was basically just for them to synchronize their workload and most of the
[4896.00 --> 4902.88]  rendering was actually done or most of the workload sharing was done by having each gpu render an
[4902.88 --> 4910.16]  alternate frame which added stutter because they wouldn't deliver at an even cadence and it also added
[4910.16 --> 4915.84]  i mean it mostly added stutter it also added inefficiency because you had to kind of sort of know
[4915.84 --> 4920.80]  what this gpu's frame is going to be before you could like work on everything so it was never very
[4920.80 --> 4927.52]  efficient and then stepping it up a tier you've got interfaces like envy link which are oh yeah
[4927.52 --> 4931.84]  right so because they were both working on essentially their own frames they both had to
[4931.84 --> 4936.80]  store all data in their own frame buffer you couldn't combine memory then you could step it up a bit and
[4936.80 --> 4944.24]  you could go to envy link which is high speed enough that the two gpus can actually pool their video memory
[4944.24 --> 4950.24]  which is pretty sick but they still can't just be treated as a single gpu that you can only use
[4950.24 --> 4956.16]  them together for highly parallel workloads like you know whether it's it's mostly non-gaming stuff
[4956.16 --> 4961.12]  at this oh yeah it's all non-gaming it's like scientific applications which is sweet and there's a lot
[4961.12 --> 4967.76]  more of that these days but super cool yeah but not applicable to gamers and then you've got apple
[4967.76 --> 4976.56]  creating this this on chip die to die interposer thing that is so freaking fast that you can basically
[4976.56 --> 4982.96]  treat every functional unit of this gpu as though of these gpus as though they are just one which is
[4982.96 --> 4989.44]  absolutely the coolest thing that came out of the entire apple event because from my point of view the
[4989.44 --> 5000.32]  mac studio itself is not particularly exciting it's it's for thunderbolt four ports is definitely not as good
[5000.32 --> 5008.56]  from a professional user standpoint as the mac pro with like pcie slots for actual cards we're going
[5008.56 --> 5016.32]  back to we're going back to octopus computers why are we doing that 10 gig thought it was over 10 gigs
[5016.32 --> 5025.36]  great hdmi 2.0 whatever that even means anymore it's 2.0 not 2.1 so i'm glad whoever did up these specs for
[5025.36 --> 5031.68]  us uh it looks like this was jonathan horst our resident apple uh apple user um so it would be the
[5031.68 --> 5040.08]  2.0 level bandwidth it's the big mac i love that thank you for that tato sd card reader usbc ports usb
[5040.08 --> 5049.60]  a ports nice that it's got a couple usb a ports at least but the m1 ultra processor is just man apple is
[5049.60 --> 5056.72]  just flexing on the rest of the industry at this point the chip is so big the performance per watt
[5056.72 --> 5064.72]  if they're to be believed which so far they haven't been they've been disingenuous but i don't think you
[5064.72 --> 5071.20]  could say that they outright have lied yeah they haven't been any more disingenuous than like nvidia
[5071.20 --> 5079.20]  or intel um it depends nvidia and intel both have periods of extreme transparency and honesty
[5079.20 --> 5084.00]  like when nvidia released frame view basically giving the entire industry access to the same
[5084.00 --> 5091.44]  tools that they use to yeah but then they evaluate the products just like completely not at all so
[5091.44 --> 5098.24]  yeah yeah that's fair well with apple it's perpetual state okay okay so can we just recognize the glimmers
[5098.24 --> 5106.00]  of goodness sure okay it's it's it's hard for me because i've been personally screwed over by nvidia so hard
[5106.00 --> 5113.12]  so many times that i just i uh yeah anyway on the gpu side of things they said the m1 ultra is
[5113.12 --> 5120.88]  comparable to an rtx 3090 while consuming 200 watts less power in industry standard benchmarks which is
[5120.88 --> 5129.52]  yeah just but man crazy but then we saw what amd's uh chipler approach to ryzen did to cpu performance
[5129.52 --> 5135.60]  back when they launched it all of a sudden i mean obviously the first iteration was not perfect yeah
[5135.60 --> 5142.00]  but boy especially if you want to talk power consumption that approach looks so good compared
[5142.00 --> 5146.64]  to what intel is doing right now with alder lake alder lake has the performance absolutely it packs
[5147.20 --> 5158.72]  but it packs heat mm-hmm yeah get it packing heat yeah yeah okay yeah um at the end of the event senior vp of
[5158.72 --> 5164.56]  hardware engineering john turnus mentioned that the mac pro is still yet to be replaced so this is a
[5164.56 --> 5171.68]  mid-tier which means that even though apple silicon has been in some cases kind of a bargain if pricing
[5171.68 --> 5181.36]  on this bad boy is anything to go by the uh whoo yeah you come out with an m1 ultra max and it's like
[5181.36 --> 5187.36]  four of them together sorry sorry i misspoke uh prices start at two thousand dollars that's for a
[5187.36 --> 5192.64]  relatively entry-level unit with 512 gigs of ssd and the ultra model starts at four thousand dollars
[5192.64 --> 5200.16]  with a one terabyte ssd in other news apple finally has a 27-inch standalone monitor after many years of
[5200.16 --> 5205.36]  not kind of doing their own monitors so now they've got the pro display xdr and the apple studio display
[5205.36 --> 5213.36]  sixteen hundred dollars i was gonna say but you'd think it was a whole computer yes boom roasted six
[5213.36 --> 5230.48]  speaker array with spatial audio ultra wide webcam with center stage which is actually very cool like keeps you in focus as you're moving around you can get pc stuff like that but a lot of it is kind of a lot of it's kind of fudgy there's a cool one we did a sponsored video on that's actually like it moves the whole camera and actually tracks you shockingly well
[5231.92 --> 5236.56]  oh is that the one you used when you were at your place with jake yeah yeah i remember seeing that and
[5236.56 --> 5240.24]  being like whoa this is actually pretty good it's like really impressive yeah okay yeah yeah uh three
[5240.24 --> 5246.32]  stand options available one can choose a simple tilt stand or vase amount um for four hundred dollars you
[5246.32 --> 5255.04]  can get tilt and height adjustments an a13 chip uh like is a computer yeah pretty much the heck and the
[5255.04 --> 5261.76]  nano texture glass is available for three hundred dollars so that's cool there's an iphone se gets an a15 chip
[5261.76 --> 5268.40]  from the iphone 13 and 5g uh no millimeter wave and it's only two by two memo so all right but that's
[5268.40 --> 5274.96]  probably fine everything else is unchanged but the camera and battery improvements um that mostly come
[5274.96 --> 5281.04]  from the chip prices up thirty dollars to 429. man that's iphone se is just like kind of a killer value
[5282.72 --> 5288.96]  four hundred and thirty bucks not bad and the ipad air now has an m1 chip like the ipad pro raising
[5288.96 --> 5294.88]  everything more questions about whether the ipad pro has any reason to exist unless you absolutely
[5294.88 --> 5299.92]  need the much larger screen pricing is now six hundred dollars and other miscellaneous you can
[5299.92 --> 5304.72]  now get a green iphone some people use them as uh art tablets i think actually want the bigger screen oh
[5304.72 --> 5309.44]  yeah yeah but if but i said unless you need a bigger screen yeah yeah i think marquez said it probably best
[5309.44 --> 5316.08]  he devoted exactly 59 seconds to the new colors of iphones and did it as a youtube short uh short that seemed
[5316.08 --> 5320.72]  appropriate to me yeah uh apple tv plus has movies and exclusive mlb games man there are so many
[5320.72 --> 5325.20]  baseball games did you know they play like 160 games in the season or something stupid like that
[5325.20 --> 5330.00]  they just pack them in yeah it's crazy yeah it's not as like physically demanding as a lot of other
[5330.00 --> 5335.68]  sports they just slam them in because you don't need as much recovery time i mean except the pitchers
[5335.68 --> 5340.48]  i'm sure the pitchers get wrecked well they well they do like they all are and they won't even pitch
[5340.48 --> 5345.04]  nine innings like yeah yeah i was being serious when i was saying that but like outside of that it's not
[5345.04 --> 5356.88]  as yeah in other exciting news artesian builds uh exciting news okay has completely soiled all over
[5356.88 --> 5364.56]  itself yeah they became infamous in the pc building community when their ceo noah cats that's right noah
[5364.56 --> 5375.92]  cats only dogs oh it's not funny um when their ceo noah cats denied the streamer kia pia a pc that
[5376.64 --> 5381.92]  she had been drawn for on stream which was illegal by the way you can't just like change the terms of
[5381.92 --> 5388.24]  your giveaway mid giveaway so the story is oh well whatever under 5 000 on all socials if you know what
[5388.24 --> 5395.52]  forget it let's just re-roll let's re-roll um that's the re-roll and although cats actions sucked
[5395.52 --> 5399.36]  it is the kind of thing where you'd expect them to just put their tail between their legs for a bit
[5399.36 --> 5405.44]  and keep cats off camera unfortunately for the 40 to 50 employees that work there
[5406.88 --> 5411.12]  how have i never heard of these guys and they have the same number of employees as us
[5411.12 --> 5418.08]  who is buying artesian build computers they popped off they're not very old if i remember correctly they
[5418.08 --> 5426.32]  started in like 2018 or 2019 or something um they they popped off through just pushing i i think a lot
[5426.32 --> 5432.24]  of these like affiliate accounts through twitch and they're very like twitch focused builder i guess
[5432.88 --> 5440.80]  what yeah they had they had a a place where they built the bulk of their computers which was in the east
[5440.80 --> 5447.92]  that was ran by the former coo i i know this just from watching like steve's video um it's a great video
[5448.88 --> 5455.36]  and then the ceo was in the west and he had a smaller kind of area they did build computers there yeah it
[5455.36 --> 5461.52]  was mostly these stream computers that they would build them on stream and then give them away but
[5461.52 --> 5467.68]  they also built some other computers there um and apparently the ceo quit a while back i don't know
[5467.68 --> 5474.96]  exactly when because of uh clashing differences with noah cats and apparently the the side of the business
[5474.96 --> 5481.28]  that the ceo was running was allegedly allegedly this is all everything here is allegedly yes if
[5481.28 --> 5486.88]  you want better information probably just watch steve's video yeah sure um but and a lot of this
[5486.88 --> 5492.24]  is just ripped off from steve's video anyways to be completely honest hi steve um but yeah apparently
[5492.24 --> 5499.68]  that side of the company was run a little bit more you know better um a little more better yeah steve would
[5499.68 --> 5507.76]  have said it and there's been a fair amount of kind of you know assumptions that from from employees
[5507.76 --> 5514.00]  that worked there and also people trying to look at the company from the outside that noah cats at kind
[5514.00 --> 5519.20]  of near the end barely even cared and just wanted to work on the twitch side of things he just wanted
[5519.20 --> 5527.44]  to like get twitch famous talk to twitch streamers do that type of stuff um pretty rough yeah the company was
[5527.44 --> 5534.24]  very clearly on its last legs because it's gone now so this week the company's bank accounts were
[5534.24 --> 5540.48]  frozen with the people in purchasing no longer being able to purchase things after this things
[5540.48 --> 5545.12]  are bad cats essentially ghosted the company for a couple days this is all allegedly okay i don't even
[5545.12 --> 5550.08]  care yeah the company was allegedly investigated for tax fraud their twitter password was allegedly
[5550.08 --> 5555.60]  changed so employees couldn't post refunds were allegedly stopped for customers after several days of
[5555.60 --> 5560.16]  nearly no communication the employees were hit with an email saying that all the financial assets
[5560.16 --> 5566.16]  are frozen while an outside council performs a reorganization and all employees are suspended
[5566.16 --> 5571.84]  until further notice i believe that email included a thing saying like hopefully we'll be able to bring
[5571.84 --> 5578.40]  you back if we figure things out so if you have recently bought an artesian builds pc and you do not
[5578.40 --> 5586.56]  have it yet in your hands you need to call your credit card company and get a charge back now yeah huh
[5587.60 --> 5595.04]  this is all crazy through all this allegedly cats doesn't seem to grasp that he just caused 50 people
[5595.04 --> 5601.28]  to lose their jobs and employees feel like he saw the company as more of a cool sandbox instead of like a
[5601.28 --> 5606.16]  company with real people working for it cool sandbox make him twitch famous to be clear so yeah if viewers of
[5606.16 --> 5610.88]  the wan show are currently hiring people with pc building experience um maybe maybe kind of reach
[5610.88 --> 5617.04]  out there might be some there might be some pc system integrator experienced people out there who are
[5617.04 --> 5626.64]  looking for work uh steve we got a quote from steven burke uh from gamers nexus steven burke the thing
[5627.20 --> 5632.48]  the thing that's really troubling about this one is just how absolutely idiotic the collapse of this company was
[5636.16 --> 5641.84]  wow uh and this is in the comments of the video an employee allegedly said uh working for this
[5641.84 --> 5648.16]  company was so rewarding when you weren't talking to noah or working with noah so sad that so many
[5648.16 --> 5653.20]  staff lost their jobs i hope my colleagues can find comfort elsewhere uh abe radshaw
[5653.20 --> 5665.76]  yeah or abby i think i don't think it's ape but yeah yeah really rough um talk about going out in a
[5665.76 --> 5672.32]  ball of fire yeah that was that was pretty wild uh steve talks in his video about like how this was
[5672.32 --> 5679.60]  really bad but probably fixable by any like reasonable company yeah make a proper apology video yeah find a way
[5679.60 --> 5685.04]  to kind of fix it say like we're going to spend some time working on making sure that effectively
[5685.04 --> 5690.56]  this never happened thank you for your feedback we have taken it seriously just give me the computer
[5690.56 --> 5698.96]  yeah like immediately when this started gaining any momentum you needed to be like that was super stupid
[5698.96 --> 5705.84]  here's a computer i am so sorry dumb our bad yeah you can revise your giveaway rules going forward
[5705.84 --> 5714.48]  fine right like i from a business standpoint i i also personally do not see the value of
[5715.68 --> 5720.16]  you know having someone like thousand dollar computers yeah giving away thousand dollar computers
[5720.16 --> 5725.36]  or multi-thousand dollar computers to people who are not going to generate thousands or multiple
[5725.36 --> 5732.80]  thousands of dollars in profit because right like at the end of the day marketing has to have some
[5732.80 --> 5737.92]  kind of a return on investment i can understand some of it because they're trying to get all like
[5737.92 --> 5742.80]  new up-and-coming streamers to start working with them they're trying to like buy out all the up-and-coming
[5742.80 --> 5747.52]  streamers and there's a cost to that yeah but they try okay they tried to they tried to offer it to
[5747.52 --> 5753.92]  her the problem is that they should have done it right away yeah like right away problem is jay was on it
[5753.92 --> 5759.12]  by the time i even knew about this jay already had a computer he had already yeah exactly i was like
[5759.12 --> 5765.20]  a needy reaction that's fantastic wow and and to be honest he just straight up insulted her and like
[5765.20 --> 5769.20]  made fun of her so she probably just straight up didn't want i actually didn't watch the whole thing
[5769.20 --> 5774.08]  because it was just kind of painful to watch it's really like really stupid oh yeah okay it's it's
[5774.08 --> 5778.80]  well that's fair enough um so like yeah i mean even if they did reach out to her it's it would be
[5778.80 --> 5783.92]  something that would be difficult to recover from but it's i mean it's possible you pull noah off camera
[5783.92 --> 5789.32]  for an extended period of time potentially ever yeah but you just pull him off camera and you go
[5789.32 --> 5795.72]  like yeah that was extremely bad we're working on fixing this whatever i mean people have been making
[5795.72 --> 5802.66]  apology videos and then recovering from it for years now it's not exactly a new thing um you thank jay i
[5802.66 --> 5809.48]  mean that would be an interesting way to go yeah like it's cool that the wow that's a next level move
[5809.48 --> 5814.00]  yeah it's cool the computer industry like has each other's back so much i'm really unhappy that
[5814.00 --> 5818.44]  this time we were on the wrong side of it but i'm happy to see that or you like you replace jay's
[5818.44 --> 5823.58]  computer or something like that you'd be like hey jay or you know thanks for thanks for that
[5823.58 --> 5830.08]  give this away to your viewers sure yeah something like that you try and turn an l into a w yeah you
[5830.08 --> 5836.90]  know you could just you take two l's and you just yeah perfect uh but yeah it's i mean it would
[5836.90 --> 5842.20]  have been rough but like you don't expect that issue to just delete your entire company of 50
[5842.20 --> 5848.02]  employees yeah within a week or whatever it was right honestly you know i'm looking at this going
[5848.02 --> 5852.92]  wow you can make a system builder with that kind of momentum just by having a few people watch you
[5852.92 --> 5858.74]  build computers on twitch i should make a computer company well maybe you can't it's kind of the side
[5858.74 --> 5865.10]  story right because it sounds i mean they weren't able to do business in california they were being
[5865.10 --> 5870.74]  looked at for tax fraud all this kind of stuff so like the the company was on the company was limping
[5870.74 --> 5875.74]  it might have been better when the coo was there everything i've been finding is that all the all
[5875.74 --> 5882.66]  the people were much happier with that person um and maybe the the company ran more uh what is it
[5882.66 --> 5890.52]  called flushed when he was around i don't know um but yeah yeah okay that's another one steve is is
[5890.52 --> 5895.42]  helping the employees he's getting them all to reach out to him and i believe he's trying to find
[5895.42 --> 5900.16]  like system integrator companies that are hiring people so he can try to help them get jobs and
[5900.16 --> 5907.02]  stuff steve's being really cool about all this um so that's i mean that's awesome and if you are
[5907.02 --> 5910.84]  watching this and you're an employee there and you somehow haven't already heard about that
[5910.84 --> 5918.36]  uh reach out to steve and i'm sure you have yeah i'm sure they have as well yeah all right well
[5918.36 --> 5927.68]  that's uh that's very it's not even unfortunate because it's not fortune that caused this well
[5927.68 --> 5932.24]  it's unfortunate for the people it's unfortunate for the employees yeah yeah and hopefully they
[5932.24 --> 5943.50]  they land on their feet oh man here's some big news amd asks motherboard manufacturers to remove
[5943.50 --> 5952.20]  overclocking options for the ryzen 7 5700 x3d so we've been talking for years about how companies
[5952.20 --> 5958.12]  aren't your friends so when people have been bringing up like amd are the good guys it's like
[5958.12 --> 5964.16]  it may be a little more nuanced than that luke i don't mean it probably is i'm just saying
[5964.16 --> 5972.10]  i'm just saying this will be the first chip out of amd with their 3d v cache okay so it's got way
[5972.10 --> 5980.56]  way more cache than we've seen on amd cpus in the past but it seems like it comes with a bit of a catch
[5980.56 --> 5988.28]  compared to the regular 5800 x it has lower base and boost clocks the same price tag at launch
[5988.28 --> 5994.62]  and currently no overclocking so tech power up verified the rumor posted on video cards
[5994.62 --> 6003.14]  and amd is refusing to explain why the chip can't overclock uh and i don't believe that they have
[6003.14 --> 6009.26]  given any indication as to whether or not it will be unlocked by the time consumers can actually get
[6009.26 --> 6016.04]  their hands on these things so basically they sent this note to manufacturers 5800 x 3d
[6016.04 --> 6029.64]  8 core 16 thread 100 dash part number 105 watt ajisa uh pi 1206b 1 slash 28 please hide vermeer x cpu oc
[6029.64 --> 6036.06]  bios setup options to my knowledge even motherboard manufacturers haven't been given any explanation
[6036.06 --> 6045.78]  as to yeah why overclocking is blocked but it seems like this massive 96 megabytes of level 3
[6045.78 --> 6053.44]  cache probably has something to do with it there has to be there has to be something that amd is
[6053.44 --> 6060.54]  trying to protect in this chip by not allowing users to overclock because they've actually been
[6060.54 --> 6066.16]  pretty cool about overclocking for the most part every ryzen's chip has been unlocked there's a bunch
[6066.16 --> 6071.14]  of people in flipping chat saying amd bad now that's not what i was trying to say i'm not saying they're bad
[6071.14 --> 6077.70]  i'm just saying they're not your friend no company no company is your friend not not bad they're just
[6077.70 --> 6085.30]  they're in it to win it and win it is your money not your feelings yeah 100 unless your feelings lead
[6085.30 --> 6094.28]  you to want to give them your money yes in other news limewire is back hey stick to austria to austrian
[6094.28 --> 6101.94]  entrepreneurs bought the rights to limewire and they're launching a new company limewire gmbh
[6101.94 --> 6107.86]  paul and julian not going to try to say that last name uh spun up the company they think it'll evoke
[6107.86 --> 6114.60]  nostalgia for millennials and gen z which i'm sure gen z i don't think so limewire was dead by the time we
[6114.60 --> 6120.82]  were in high school wasn't it i can't imagine gen zers being too nostalgic about limewire um but yeah
[6120.82 --> 6127.38]  like very early high school for me limewire was super gone yeah or you'd like go over to your
[6127.38 --> 6130.88]  friend's house who's not very computer savvy and they'd still have it and their computer would just
[6130.88 --> 6135.90]  be wrecked because of all the viruses and it's just like oh okay that's why um like are you sure you
[6135.90 --> 6142.34]  don't want to use sherry as a or whatever yeah uh the the platform will be used
[6142.34 --> 6151.94]  for nfts nfts attached to music content and artworks using limewire you'll be able to create
[6151.94 --> 6160.66]  buy and trade nft collectibles with ease you can join a wait list i guess they have a roadmap i guess
[6160.66 --> 6168.82]  our discussion question written by nicholas plouf is why does music need nfts it doesn't because music
[6168.82 --> 6175.94]  evokes emotion which evokes opening your wallet hey hey there it is reference horse armor yeah
[6176.82 --> 6182.74]  very nice we all know what happened to the wu-tang album we don't want that to happen again i want to
[6182.74 --> 6188.90]  hear from you guys flow plane chat are there any gen zers in there that have any nostalgia whatsoever for
[6188.90 --> 6194.66]  limewire i seriously don't i'm trying to remember what the what the order was of like the main
[6195.54 --> 6203.70]  the main file sharing so it was it was napster first obviously then you had kazaa i believe came after
[6203.70 --> 6210.74]  napster sort of at the same time and then after yeah sherry as a was like a fork of kazaa or something
[6210.74 --> 6218.66]  like that if i recall this is all completely from it's been a minute like teenager me's memory um and
[6218.66 --> 6226.10]  then i thought limewire was in there somewhere yeah gen z never used limewire yeah i used it but
[6226.10 --> 6236.74]  it wasn't an emotional experience roasted roasted one person said i do looking i guess gen z started mid
[6236.74 --> 6243.78]  to late 1990s that's way yeah that's way too late like they would have been actual children yeah at this
[6243.78 --> 6249.30]  point yeah you must have been pretty young if that was nostalgia i'm borderline gen z millennial and i got
[6249.30 --> 6260.10]  a lot of viruses as a kid oh man i feel like dealing with viruses is like was much more of a thing back
[6260.10 --> 6265.70]  then it's funny uh jaden's like i'm on the edge of millennial don't remember it after elementary school
[6265.70 --> 6271.38]  which is so funny to me because using your parents computer wasn't really as much of a thing when i was in
[6271.38 --> 6278.82]  elementary school oh yeah right like for sure yeah i like i wasn't why why i'm sitting here going oh
[6278.82 --> 6283.38]  well why would an elementary school kid be like allowed on the internet oh okay a lot of my friends
[6283.38 --> 6290.26]  in elementary school didn't have the internet it wasn't until i'm trying to think like no joke man did
[6290.26 --> 6297.14]  i have i don't think i had internet when i lived at my dad's place exactly that's my point until 97.
[6297.14 --> 6306.42]  wow yeah i mean like later elementary school like in grades six it was it was quite common yeah but i
[6306.42 --> 6311.14]  specifically remember like grade three grade four like a lot of people didn't have yeah a lot of people
[6311.14 --> 6321.06]  didn't have the internet crazy all right aging ourselves a little bit oh this is great did you dude
[6321.06 --> 6326.66]  millennial you haven't heard three doors down kryptonite without hearing all the screeching beeps
[6327.30 --> 6332.90]  remember when they used to seed corrupted files into the into the file sharing networks that was so
[6332.90 --> 6342.50]  awesome boom boom boom the file you're listening to is available on but like universal music oh man i
[6342.50 --> 6351.38]  remember that oh it's so great yeah it's been a long time there was nutella i never used nutella
[6351.38 --> 6360.34]  i don't remember that one at all codependent says holy shnikes supposedly emule still works oh no
[6361.78 --> 6365.94]  we should do some uh we should do some i almost said super chats we don't do those in here uh we should
[6365.94 --> 6372.34]  do some merch messages yeah gianna says hey linus and luke you said you'd like ltd store to be sort of
[6372.34 --> 6377.70]  a lifestyle brand besides more plain stealth items what are some lifestyle products you envision for ltd
[6377.70 --> 6384.66]  store well i mean the the screwdriver backpack yeah there's the women's clothing doesn't i guess that's
[6384.66 --> 6390.10]  plain that's still clothing yeah uh we have it says stealth and i was like there's no logos we have puzzles
[6390.10 --> 6396.66]  coming so that's cool like basically we just don't want to be constrained by traditional merch there's
[6396.66 --> 6403.70]  the i think there's only one right now but the kid products yeah the book yeah it's pretty unique to
[6403.70 --> 6408.34]  have a book yeah yeah so we just we just want to make things we want to make that we think are cool
[6408.90 --> 6416.10]  yeah rachel says hey linus by now i'm sure you've seen the suggestions for anthony to have a channel
[6416.10 --> 6424.82]  focused on linux do you have any plans for that um the problem with so we're getting into like
[6424.82 --> 6431.86]  business talk now the problem is that if i have one anthony and that is the number of anthony's that
[6431.86 --> 6437.78]  we have here at linus media group yeah so i've got one anthony trying to clone but it's hard we've got
[6437.78 --> 6445.86]  this chessboard right anthony's like the queen or the king you've got one of them okay and so they can
[6445.86 --> 6456.34]  only do one thing at a time and i could take that anthony and i could assign him to work on things that
[6457.14 --> 6463.70]  a million or two million or five million people will watch and learn from him or i could assign him to
[6463.70 --> 6471.94]  things where 30 000 30 000 or 50 000 people might watch and learn from him and anthony might really enjoy
[6471.94 --> 6479.38]  what he's working on but in the interest of the greater good both to us and to the tech community
[6479.38 --> 6486.42]  should i put the anthony in front of as many people as possible working on high profile projects or should
[6486.42 --> 6494.66]  i sideline anthony into a niche channel that will never grow beyond a certain ceiling so what you're
[6494.66 --> 6499.94]  saying is we need to get more writers to the end of the board um and then they become anthony's
[6502.34 --> 6505.62]  i don't know if that's what i was saying but i guess it's chill
[6508.26 --> 6512.58]  that's where that's where i'm at on it that's where that's where i'm out on it it's uh anthony is great
[6513.22 --> 6522.66]  but i think that uh a channel focused on linux has a ceiling and i think that it's also a community that's pretty well served like why are we why are we going in and trying to
[6522.66 --> 6529.22]  to to take over someone else's there's like almost a disproportionately large amount of linux creators
[6529.22 --> 6534.98]  yeah so there's there's a lot of content out there with mac for example we saw a unique opportunity for
[6534.98 --> 6546.10]  ourselves as sort of the the not but kissy apple coverage right and but but that still you know we we
[6546.10 --> 6551.46]  want hosts and we want writers that do love the products and love the ecosystem but are not
[6551.46 --> 6556.90]  constrained in any way by having to have a relationship with apple we will just buy horsed
[6556.90 --> 6562.50]  anything that he needs so he never has to worry about that so we're untethered in that way which
[6562.50 --> 6567.86]  is cool and i saw that as a differentiating factor but for the linux one i just i just don't see what it
[6567.86 --> 6573.78]  would be uh so it goes i feel like anthony could work on a linux video once or twice a month do you have
[6573.78 --> 6581.22]  any idea how long it takes to make a video once or twice a month would be like 40 of his output
[6582.42 --> 6591.78]  especially if it's twice in a month like no no no no no no uh kushal been watching since usb sticks
[6591.78 --> 6597.06]  killed servers and that guy was called slick if you could bring back one failed product or company
[6597.06 --> 6604.26]  but make it successful what would it be oh man i want to say engage
[6607.14 --> 6611.86]  i wish and i wish nintendo had had a competitor in the mobile gaming space all these years
[6613.70 --> 6619.14]  case labs a case labs would be pretty cool no they're not back someone bought the name but i think
[6619.14 --> 6623.46]  it's like not back yet yeah and i don't know if it will be what it was
[6626.26 --> 6631.62]  what else is what else has failed i can't think of a ton but my knee jerk was case labs but i can't
[6632.26 --> 6637.70]  i'm trying to think of things that have failed that i actually liked a cork says zune yeah yeah oh
[6638.58 --> 6642.82]  zune software was awesome yeah that's fair zune software was so legit
[6642.82 --> 6648.58]  i wouldn't want to zoom right now to be honest but zune software on my phone could be interesting
[6648.58 --> 6657.14]  la saga says vita yeah vita would be would be very legit man what a missed opportunity that was
[6657.14 --> 6661.30]  for them to just make zune the primo streaming platform oh yeah people would have people would
[6661.30 --> 6667.06]  have installed the crap out of that so for sure man microsoft for a company that is so big and so
[6667.06 --> 6675.30]  successful so many balls like man yeah if you ever wanted to sell out on nfts you could always nft
[6675.30 --> 6680.10]  the early badges on the forum that's really funny i didn't really think about that we kind of did an
[6680.10 --> 6686.82]  nft sale when we did the contributor badges on the forum how was that nft well it's like people just
[6686.82 --> 6692.90]  buying the rights to use an image that anyone could copy as like um a badge on their on their user
[6692.90 --> 6698.42]  account no well no i know it's not an nft i just mean it's you're just buying digital how it works
[6698.42 --> 6703.22]  no oh that's true it's because it's a function on the site you actually cannot just put it there yes
[6704.18 --> 6708.10]  but okay we don't care if people download the image that wasn't that wasn't the point but but
[6709.38 --> 6715.78]  hold on nfts if you set them as your profile picture on twitter do actually integrate with the
[6715.78 --> 6721.06]  platform it's not a profile picture what is it it's not a user interactable area of the website
[6721.06 --> 6728.10]  it's an award that you get oh you are splitting hairs i don't think i am i actually completely
[6728.10 --> 6733.94]  disagree this this is not no user can just do this you can't like because on on okay so you get a
[6733.94 --> 6737.70]  hexagon around it and everyone makes fun of you because you have a hexagon picture on your twitter
[6737.70 --> 6742.82]  profile so whatever that's the only difference on there you get a hexagon or you don't but no one
[6742.82 --> 6747.06]  gives a crap and they just make fun of you if you have it on the forum it's it's a non-user
[6747.06 --> 6752.82]  interactable section it's a badge holder area you can't add things there you can't subtract things
[6752.82 --> 6755.86]  from there they're just there if you've earned them or purchased them
[6758.90 --> 6765.94]  i think it's got a pretty similar vibe you're buying digital artwork you're not though well you
[6765.94 --> 6771.14]  kind of are no you're not well you're okay you're buying rep like you're you're buying you're flexing
[6771.14 --> 6777.14]  yes by buying an image 100 yeah then it's the same thing but you're buying you're buying an award
[6777.14 --> 6784.66]  the image part doesn't matter the image part was actually so bad that remember we drew some of them
[6784.66 --> 6790.42]  in paint and tried to make them intentionally bad wow the chat is very divided on this
[6790.42 --> 6800.26]  wow some of it was artwork olenic i mean some artists created it and also uh i did some hand
[6800.26 --> 6808.26]  drawn ones that were very expensive and they were intentionally awful um and it's just one of them
[6810.10 --> 6816.66]  but yes but theoretically an nft is just one but and anyone can download it and we knew that from the
[6816.66 --> 6821.54]  start but no one else can add it as their badge on their profile that's true ryan carson points out
[6821.54 --> 6829.22]  that it can't be resold yeah so it's worse than an nft yeah sure i don't know i'm just saying it's
[6829.22 --> 6835.06]  not an nft that that's like that's like saying skins and video games are nfts it's like no i think they
[6835.06 --> 6839.78]  are certainly precursors that's why i keep bringing up horse armor every time we talk about it because
[6839.78 --> 6848.34]  it's paying actual real actual money for intangible pixels but it's it's a lot of nfts even though they
[6848.34 --> 6853.78]  they don't have exclusivity built into it at all because you can just mint more of them like it's
[6853.78 --> 6859.06]  literally part of the whole idea there's literally artists that have just minted like 50 of one photo
[6859.06 --> 6865.22]  and they've been like whatever um they they come with an assumption of exclusivity game skins do not
[6865.22 --> 6870.10]  it's just a thing that you buy it's an art attribution that you buy that has nothing to
[6870.10 --> 6874.98]  do with nfts right but in the same so game skins whether we're talking game skins or whether we're
[6874.98 --> 6880.10]  talking a badge on the forum the scarcity is determined by the provider you can't just say
[6880.10 --> 6886.34]  anything in the world that has a scarcity element to it is an nft no but i'm not saying it is an nft
[6886.34 --> 6892.18]  i'm saying it's a very like one okay we're gonna let the community decide i think luke and i have both
[6892.18 --> 6896.42]  had an opportunity to make our cases here this drop hole actually gonna work this time i don't know
[6896.42 --> 6901.06]  it's been pretty broken lately so i've dropped it in the float plane chat i've dropped it in the twitch
[6901.06 --> 6906.82]  chat against my better judgment because those are all the talks because af jk love you twitch chat and
[6906.82 --> 6912.18]  i'm dropping it in youtube now which moves so fast that i can't even no one's gonna be able to click on
[6912.18 --> 6920.74]  it i gotta wonder you know youtube chat what's up we don't talk much but um the reason is that it moves
[6920.74 --> 6928.58]  so fast that there can't possibly be any meaningful interaction in it so why do you guys bother you type
[6928.58 --> 6934.58]  yeah it's i i saw an interesting conversation about it because we're it was like a comparison of a bunch
[6934.58 --> 6941.78]  of different streaming tools and like um the value of slowness was part of the conversation and twitch chat
[6942.18 --> 6948.42]  there there's just as much interaction in twitch chat but twitch chat loads in like chunks so
[6948.42 --> 6953.38]  you'll see a bunch of messages and then it'll go and it'll take off but then you'll see they'll sit
[6953.38 --> 6958.90]  there for a sec yeah you'll be able to read them and then they'll take off again and then youtube is
[6958.90 --> 6965.14]  a continuous thing it's actually much faster which makes it unreadable so it's almost good that the
[6965.14 --> 6970.50]  twitch version is slower because you can actually interact with it even though it's so fast well three
[6970.50 --> 6975.22]  quarters of the community agrees with you but i realize i actually kind of phrased the question
[6975.22 --> 6980.02]  you put the you put the question wrong yeah i kind of asked the question wrong i'm gonna take this w anyways
[6981.94 --> 6992.02]  well you're welcome but you yeah you just you said it wrong all right um fine i'm over it
[6992.02 --> 6999.62]  back to merch messages i should just i should just sell out and sell nfts no i should just sell out
[6999.62 --> 7007.30]  and then buy a hawaiian island you should just you should you should get like one of the crater
[7007.30 --> 7013.38]  where i warehouse people to draw like a poo and then sell it for like a million dollars well that's
[7013.38 --> 7020.98]  exactly it it'd be hilarious if someone actually buys it does it make it better if you openly mock
[7020.98 --> 7026.90]  it and sell it i we decided i think we talked about this before and we decided no no it doesn't make it
[7026.90 --> 7033.94]  any better because you are still cynically taking advantage of someone else's belief that it will
[7033.94 --> 7039.38]  appreciate in value someone will end up holding that bag and that bag is full of turds
[7039.38 --> 7048.58]  oh that that's an nft collection that i don't think has been made yet bag of turds yeah and each bag is
[7048.58 --> 7055.86]  like unique so when you buy it you get a picture of what kind of turds were inside it
[7059.62 --> 7068.74]  oh boy that's rough yeah all right back to it from uh brayden love the show currently looking for a
[7068.74 --> 7075.30]  new mouse my old mx vertical broke and i wanted a better mouse for gaming preferably ergonomic any
[7075.30 --> 7086.18]  recommendations oh boy um brayden if you liked the mx vertical um i don't know what to recommend you
[7086.18 --> 7093.06]  because i definitely did not jive with the mx vertical it's a weird mouse it's a weird mouse can i
[7093.06 --> 7098.66]  show your screen uh yeah sure here one sec oh i already did it no it's fine okay it's just loading
[7098.66 --> 7105.46]  there we go yeah that's the vertical so suggesting a different mouse than the vertical is like
[7106.98 --> 7113.70]  kind of tough yeah thanks for thanks for writing into the show though but i just don't even know
[7113.70 --> 7120.82]  where to begin you're showing yours whoops wrong screen uh robert why do screens have a minimum
[7120.82 --> 7125.70]  brightness i get the max but why can't i turn it all the way down to zero percent that is a wonderful
[7125.70 --> 7133.78]  question and it has to do with the way that screen brightness is modulated so whether it's pwm modulation
[7133.78 --> 7140.42]  which used to be more common on earlier lcds and was good because it allowed you to effectively go
[7140.42 --> 7150.34]  down to zero brightness just by pulsing the um the power to the backlight more or less often um but
[7150.34 --> 7157.38]  had the drawback of flickering uh and strobing like it was it was annoying and could give people uh
[7158.42 --> 7165.86]  mild side effects like headaches or whatever the case may be so now we use dc modulation or and it's not
[7165.86 --> 7172.18]  really modulation at that point we use dc control so we adjust the voltage being provided and the reason
[7172.18 --> 7179.06]  that you can't just keep taking the voltage down to zero is that electronics have a minimum voltage that
[7179.06 --> 7187.78]  is required for them to run now i would love to see some innovation um around something like um
[7187.78 --> 7196.58]  uh nd filters for example oh like interesting so we have uh lenses for example in the studio where
[7196.58 --> 7204.10]  there's there's two nd filters that you can uh counter rotate to allow more or less light to pass through
[7204.10 --> 7210.98]  and they are mostly transparent in terms of not not coloring the light that passes through them i think
[7210.98 --> 7217.14]  something like that would be an amazing way to achieve uh lower light output but maybe that's just
[7217.14 --> 7222.90]  something that could be an accessory for a product like uh like a portable handheld gaming system or
[7222.90 --> 7228.26]  or something along those lines but the reality of it is you just can't turn the voltage lower and
[7228.26 --> 7233.38]  lower and lower because eventually you just won't be able to drive the screen off yeah yeah
[7235.62 --> 7241.54]  uh next one was from kyle he said would you ever consider doing a collab with the guys at nasa space flight
[7241.54 --> 7248.26]  it'd be super cool to see the camera robotics and networking they've developed uh and use for rocket
[7248.26 --> 7254.50]  launch tracking and live streams uh maybe petabyte build for them too yeah we we actually have a contact
[7254.50 --> 7261.06]  of the canadian space agency now do we really yeah he reached out saying like i can't join full time but
[7261.06 --> 7270.26]  we would be interested in like consulting or helping with labs interesting um so i mean that could be cool
[7270.26 --> 7276.18]  yeah that's super cool i mean we yeah we're down to collab um it's i think you guys
[7277.54 --> 7284.74]  overestimate the simplicity of making a video about sciencey stuff like that yeah it's kind of a
[7284.74 --> 7292.42]  challenging thing to make engaging to an average viewer and we're at a point where ltt can't upload a video
[7292.42 --> 7298.74]  that only appeals to a hundred thousand people that is not sustainable for our company everything we upload
[7298.74 --> 7305.38]  has to at least appeal to a million people so whenever we do something that's like holy crap look
[7305.38 --> 7315.78]  at this thing there has to be enough that is relatable to our um to our consumer our predominantly
[7315.78 --> 7323.70]  consumer audience if you were able to check out like the control center at houston i think that might
[7323.70 --> 7329.22]  be transferable enough yeah you but okay the problem with that is that you'd have to have
[7329.22 --> 7334.66]  complete enough access to it oh yeah that you're able to make a compelling video which might not be
[7334.66 --> 7340.18]  possible if they came in and they were just like you get a standard tour here's this room what does that
[7340.18 --> 7345.86]  do that's classified yeah what does that do classified that's not a video there's no video agree so that's
[7345.86 --> 7354.02]  one of the that's one of the ground rules that we have anytime someone brings us in to do a a piece of
[7354.02 --> 7358.58]  content about something that's more industrial or more enterprise is we basically go okay look it's
[7358.58 --> 7364.90]  going to have to be unfettered if i ask you to pull up your uh you know your your raised cable management
[7364.90 --> 7370.90]  floor you say how high how many tiles do you want removed if i say i want to crawl around in it you say
[7370.90 --> 7378.66]  when will that be like it's we have to be able to come in and do our jobs did i ever tell you about
[7378.66 --> 7385.62]  uh remember when i went to you probably don't um but i went to iem intel extreme masters yes i do
[7385.62 --> 7391.06]  remember that and wasn't that where you beat up that girl in like mario kart no that was that was pax
[7391.06 --> 7397.22]  no that was a specific nintendo event was it yeah all right yeah he's an awful person i really
[7397.22 --> 7405.70]  ugh people i'm not gonna go over that story but um uh no we we were able to go backstage and we
[7405.70 --> 7411.70]  wanted we we were gonna make a video of the like oh that's right of the the big like uh video wall or
[7411.70 --> 7417.94]  whatever or like uh some display or networking it was the the control center how they manage all the
[7417.94 --> 7422.74]  incoming streams and how they like mux it all together to send it out right and we made a video
[7422.74 --> 7430.50]  back there and the what what is it yes esa or something the esea i'm not sure yes yeah the
[7430.50 --> 7434.66]  company that like runs the i think it's esea yes yeah
[7437.78 --> 7442.42]  oh i think it was i don't remember the the company that was running the tournament yeah um
[7442.42 --> 7451.86]  they saw the video go up we're like what because intel was like yeah sure that's fine and then just
[7451.86 --> 7457.94]  got us back there and then none of the people that were there were like this is a problem because i
[7457.94 --> 7462.90]  was clearly being escorted by intel people so they were like i don't know but the people that actually
[7462.90 --> 7468.58]  owned that section which was not intel were like huh and it ended up all being totally fine right
[7469.22 --> 7475.78]  uh but there can be very sensitive information right yeah and um foster pay go over on twitch chat
[7475.78 --> 7482.90]  says that's right i agree but linus uh put it in a way that sounded pretty bossy well yeah i did
[7482.90 --> 7491.06]  because if you expect me to come in and do my job which is to make your thing be interesting i think it
[7491.06 --> 7498.18]  was the how high part well got a little that's the answer don't tell me how to do my job i've been doing
[7498.18 --> 7505.86]  it longer than you that's the reality of it and so if your goal is to have me come in yeah thanks uh if
[7505.86 --> 7512.10]  your goal is to have me come in and make an interesting video then you have to facilitate it
[7512.10 --> 7518.02]  it can't it can't you can't be blocking me we're on the same team is pretty much what i'm trying to
[7518.02 --> 7524.74]  say and i potentially be certain things but it there needs to like i'm reasonable yeah obviously yeah but
[7524.74 --> 7529.62]  that's the reason that i specifically said that this is really challenging when it comes to
[7529.62 --> 7537.62]  industrial or enterprise applications because it's not immediately relatable like making a video
[7537.62 --> 7547.14]  about say for example an enterprise storage appliance okay making that interesting to a million people
[7547.14 --> 7553.46]  or two million people is not simple and it's not something that's necessarily intuitive to the kinds of
[7553.46 --> 7559.30]  people that work in pr or corporate communications for a company that produces a product like that
[7559.30 --> 7564.34]  especially if you can like only look at it from the outside or something exactly so if i show up and
[7564.34 --> 7570.34]  i'm like hey i want to see the backplane and they're like no sorry and i go okay i need to open the chassis
[7570.34 --> 7576.18]  and they're like no and i kind of go well i need to see the cooling system and they go sorry we can't show
[7576.18 --> 7582.26]  you that right then you're basically asking me to come and do my job while you put up obstacles that
[7582.26 --> 7586.82]  prevent me from doing my job yeah right so they just want a bad advertisement at that point but
[7586.82 --> 7592.66]  they don't even realize it would be bad and that's it so they just want an advertisement it's like no
[7592.66 --> 7599.94]  it has to be interesting exactly exactly there's nothing that grinds my gears more than someone who
[7599.94 --> 7606.50]  expects me to come in and produce an ad for them like no this is a give and take relationship
[7606.50 --> 7616.26]  i need content you want content let's work together is the point that i was trying to make
[7616.26 --> 7624.34]  and so when it comes okay hp had a sand years ago right so when it comes to creating obstacles for me no
[7624.34 --> 7632.66]  i don't tolerate it i just won't go i'll say look these are the terms you have to you have to be open with
[7632.66 --> 7640.02]  us you have to give us access we have to be able to climb up on a thing if that's what we need for an
[7640.02 --> 7646.58]  interesting shot you got to accept that and if you don't then have someone else do your do your corporate
[7646.58 --> 7652.58]  tour video and no one will watch it because there's a reason people watch what we do and they don't watch
[7652.58 --> 7658.74]  that because that's boring yeah i'm not going to go in and make not boring content because i can't upload that
[7658.74 --> 7670.10]  that's the way it is yeah uh we've got some more merch messages here jason says my 11 year old wants
[7670.10 --> 7675.70]  to create youtube videos any recommendations on where to start gear applications etc your phone
[7675.70 --> 7683.70]  your phone your phone and some free or cheap video editing software on your phone because the first
[7683.70 --> 7688.18]  thing any 11 year old needs to figure out is if they're actually passionate about this or if they're
[7688.18 --> 7693.46]  going to do it one time and forget about it not even that there's there's extremely successful
[7694.10 --> 7700.34]  many million views per video many million subscriber channels that work exclusively off of iphones like
[7700.34 --> 7705.94]  straight up robin 5693 asks linus what if there's a safety reason you're not allowed like a radiation area
[7705.94 --> 7712.18]  then the next thing i'll say is okay i want to see the control center for the radiation control system
[7712.18 --> 7716.34]  or something or something or something yeah you have to give me something like you said
[7717.30 --> 7724.90]  to be reasonable it's a visual medium right and uh negev says um oh wait why was luke escorted by intel
[7724.90 --> 7729.54]  people because you just are when you're in a restricted area you need an escort that's normal
[7729.54 --> 7736.90]  like it's not it's not that we don't understand how the world works it's just that a lot of the time the
[7736.90 --> 7741.70]  people working in these jobs don't understand how content works they don't do it day to day they
[7741.70 --> 7746.10]  don't get it they watch the video and they go wow that's a lot of views and a lot of the times they
[7746.10 --> 7752.90]  just haven't even watched any of our actual content like i've shown up and they didn't realize that i
[7752.90 --> 7757.78]  was going to start taking things apart and i go well did you even know who i am why did you even call me
[7758.90 --> 7764.98]  you know what are which is fine i don't expect everyone to know who i am it's just that if you went to the
[7764.98 --> 7774.10]  trouble to fly me here i figured you might that's all yeah um nathaniel are there any videos you
[7774.10 --> 7782.34]  regret making eg asmr build guide well that's certainly one of them uh i regret that wan show where
[7782.34 --> 7789.14]  i was like crypto will never be a thing it's going nowhere when the guy bought the house oh there's
[7789.14 --> 7794.18]  a lot of takes on wan show that i'm sure yeah for sure i'm sure there's a lot of takes on wan show
[7794.18 --> 7798.66]  that we probably regret and there's a lot of takes on wan show that also like end up ended up becoming
[7798.66 --> 7808.82]  like prophetic statements um i don't know who knows videos you regret making man that wd sponsorship at
[7808.82 --> 7815.38]  computex that first year was pretty rough yeah so we inked a deal with it's all people who aren't there
[7815.38 --> 7820.18]  anymore so i feel like i can tell this story but we inked a deal with our wd rep man where we ever we
[7820.18 --> 7826.74]  were scrappy we were desperate back then the deal was they would be our sponsor for computex
[7827.54 --> 7835.30]  but on every day of the show we had to make a separate individual video from the wd booth
[7836.66 --> 7844.26]  and there was like getting one video out of the wd booth that year would have been a struggle been really
[7844.26 --> 7851.86]  tough i remember because that that was the that was the first show that i did kind of on my own in
[7851.86 --> 7858.10]  regards to hosting stuff and i remember like feeling kind of cheese because you just dumped all the trash
[7858.10 --> 7865.62]  on me um that's but yes but then i also remember feeling so stoked because i didn't have to do any of the
[7865.62 --> 7872.26]  wd videos all the wd stuff it was like so time consuming because they always wanted to bring
[7872.26 --> 7877.78]  some director or vp to talk to me about stuff brandon and i would cruise by you guys see you're
[7877.78 --> 7883.54]  doing something go film a whole video cruise back and you had like not progressed very far and i knew
[7883.54 --> 7889.86]  you were faster and more efficient than me so i'm just like oh my goodness this must be really rough
[7889.86 --> 7900.34]  i made an entire video this is amazing i made an entire video about the stupid hard drive inspired
[7900.90 --> 7906.26]  car that they had in the booth what didn't you specifically have to make that one too yes you
[7906.26 --> 7912.82]  had to make it about the car yeah i wanted to just integrate the car into like other thing else yeah
[7912.82 --> 7917.22]  content i remember you specifically telling me that you had to make a dedicated video just about the car
[7917.22 --> 7928.18]  and i was just like what oh no like it was kind of neat in that it's all like uh inspired by actual
[7928.18 --> 7936.34]  hard drive components like these are uh the actuator arms and stuff like that so it's like neat but man
[7936.98 --> 7944.02]  some of the like art projects that get made for shows there were not five videos worth of things in
[7944.02 --> 7953.86]  that oh six six hold on how long were there six days six days holy crap yeah um
[7955.38 --> 7962.66]  there okay oh this this reminds me of something we uh we regretted making so much that we never made it
[7962.66 --> 7974.50]  public so oh oh no okay are you sure you even want to go over that you guys are oh no so oh no one of the
[7974.50 --> 7984.66]  one of the like industry computex traditions for better or for worse i'm using the word better very
[7984.66 --> 7993.06]  charitably here not better not better um is it's a bit of a different culture over there i guess i
[7993.06 --> 7998.26]  would say i mean this used to be a thing in at western shows as well oh for sure i mean it's still
[7998.26 --> 8003.78]  a thing depending on what western show you go to that's probably fair like i went to a car show not
[8003.78 --> 8008.66]  that long i'm sure still thinking car show booth babes were definitely still a thing to use the i
[8008.66 --> 8013.46]  i in my opinion slightly derogatory term but i need you guys to understand what i'm talking about
[8013.46 --> 8019.22]  and that's the only word i really generally referred the only really word i really know for it um but
[8019.22 --> 8027.70]  we we were like oh okay should we do like a booth compilation that includes like the the the the
[8027.70 --> 8032.26]  the presenters at each booth because it's pretty typical at computex for them to have people that
[8032.26 --> 8039.38]  obviously don't work at these companies that in some cases are definitely not wearing enough clothing
[8039.38 --> 8048.34]  and we were just like many this is the cringiest thing ever and it doesn't matter if this is a thing
[8048.34 --> 8053.78]  that everyone does we're just not going to participate in this was what we ultimately decided and i'm
[8053.78 --> 8061.86]  extremely glad that we never uploaded that yeah like extremely glad i could not be more
[8061.86 --> 8068.26]  glad that that did not happen it was just it would have been one of the yeah go ahead computex
[8068.26 --> 8073.22]  was the only one because again there was there was booth babes or however you refer to them i genuinely
[8073.22 --> 8080.82]  don't know if there's another name for it i don't know um ces it was pretty big there there was summit packs
[8080.82 --> 8087.94]  but it was not very big there um but at computex computex was the only show that i knew photographers went there
[8088.50 --> 8094.42]  purely to take photos of them yeah not to cover anything to do with the show other than the
[8094.42 --> 8098.82]  the booth babes and that was that was like a big what the heck moment for me
[8105.54 --> 8112.26]  time for our next uh merch message jason when you released the stealth pins shirt you did a golden
[8112.26 --> 8116.98]  ticket design for something like five shirts what was the design and what did the prize end up being did
[8116.98 --> 8122.42]  everyone claim the prize model okay sure uh promotional model thank you that is the that is
[8122.42 --> 8129.46]  the pc term yeah uh what was the design what did we do it said something else on it what was it sorry
[8129.46 --> 8136.02]  oh oh i think we gave away cpus it was the cpu uh stealth pins shirt and i think there were different
[8136.02 --> 8144.98]  letters in it or something or the pin yeah like because it's ltt it spells out ltt kind of subtly yeah on the
[8144.98 --> 8152.58]  normal ones and it was something else for the special ones um and i believe everyone claimed
[8152.58 --> 8158.02]  them but that's a question for nick i said here's your budget to do a giveaway and then it was off my
[8158.02 --> 8163.30]  desk anonymous asks how easy was it to swap out the ssd in the steam deck actually pretty easy
[8163.94 --> 8169.62]  uh we haven't upgraded our steam deck ssds yet though but we will soon it valve has really good guides for
[8169.62 --> 8178.34]  how to do a fresh install on it so it's no big deal uh aiden next question uh from aiden is would
[8178.34 --> 8182.98]  you consider doing a what's in my bag video with the release of the ltt backpack what if that was
[8182.98 --> 8188.26]  we were talking today i didn't end up being able to have that meeting with nick uh for other reasons
[8188.26 --> 8192.42]  but we were talking today about like how we could make the product pages unique and i mentioned videos
[8192.42 --> 8197.14]  what if that was the video for the backpack yeah like a tour through the backpack with your stuff in it
[8197.14 --> 8201.70]  but that could just be a channel upload i think that the one on the product page should actually be
[8201.70 --> 8209.78]  we're talking about doing maybe for the first time ever pre-orders on a product and uh screwdriver
[8209.78 --> 8216.26]  and backpack are obvious candidates for it because they've been such cash sinks and so we're thinking
[8216.26 --> 8222.66]  about uh doing like special content for the page and um luke came up with the idea of doing like product
[8222.66 --> 8229.22]  tours of the prototypes uh kind of like a kickstarter video but actually i i'm kind of imagining it with
[8229.22 --> 8235.14]  like really crappy production values just like me in a room you might even film it it's like the
[8235.14 --> 8245.46]  cameraman sweet um we'll just show it off yeah uh yeah so yes we would consider that yeah absolutely i don't
[8245.46 --> 8250.10]  think what's in my bag is very interesting though i have a pretty boring bag i like the the little
[8250.10 --> 8254.90]  the little pouch yeah but i showed the pouch recently oh okay yeah like i just talked about
[8254.90 --> 8260.10]  it in i think uh a stream uh the steam deck disassembly stream i think i did it right julian
[8260.10 --> 8264.98]  l uh just out of curiosity would you ever be doing interested in doing an ltt video on the tech behind
[8264.98 --> 8269.06]  vtubers and try turning yourself into one yeah i think it'd be really interesting it is pretty
[8269.06 --> 8273.46]  interesting and i think from a business standpoint it would actually make a ton of sense to get into it
[8273.46 --> 8281.14]  it's really advanced stuff like it's actually really cool i don't know one any chance of products
[8281.14 --> 8288.26]  making their way back onto amazon or was that a one-off yes they're supposed to in all seriousness
[8288.26 --> 8294.50]  though the the creator warehouse team is super busy we have a new uh we have a new like logistics
[8294.50 --> 8299.22]  person and she hopefully is going to do a way better job of smoothing out our ordering
[8299.22 --> 8307.30]  so really excited about that cool but it's going to take time yeah and our restocks right uh zachary
[8307.30 --> 8312.66]  hey thanks for making night shift great hey heck yeah zachary another water bottle for the collection
[8312.66 --> 8317.06]  any tips for a small tech content creator i mean it's the same thing i tell everyone right like
[8317.62 --> 8323.06]  you gotta find you gotta find your own voice you gotta find something that you are really passionate
[8323.06 --> 8328.98]  about i think i think the way the met is going now is it's less about trying to
[8328.98 --> 8338.50]  be a huge um do everything creator and more about finding a niche and absolutely killing it like
[8338.50 --> 8347.94]  vincent from hdtv test for example just gets so far into the weeds on tv and panel technology that
[8351.86 --> 8358.90]  he puts himself in a position where he can get big enough in that niche that if he decided to branch out
[8358.90 --> 8364.74]  he's got this captive audience and i think that's the best way to gain a foothold these days versus
[8364.74 --> 8370.34]  just trying to be another tech youtuber people like passion so if you're super passionate and
[8370.34 --> 8374.74]  super knowledgeable about one particular thing just run with that thing super hard like linus was saying
[8375.62 --> 8380.18]  hey larson luke now that most online computer parts places are kind of shady can we trust pc part
[8380.18 --> 8385.46]  picker and tiger direct for our pc parts ordering didn't tiger directly i didn't know they existed
[8385.46 --> 8391.70]  anymore go down at some point are they still a thing holy crap they're still a thing whoa march mayhem
[8391.70 --> 8400.34]  hot picks this is so ncix-y basketball has something to do with computers uh wow
[8401.86 --> 8404.74]  3.89 dell i5 14-inch laptop
[8407.22 --> 8413.22]  wow um yeah i don't really know what to tell you about that who knows
[8413.22 --> 8419.46]  um we don't vet computer shops yeah pc part picker i don't think actually sells anything
[8419.46 --> 8423.38]  directly i think they did yeah i don't i've heard very good things about mem or uh
[8426.34 --> 8432.82]  what are they called micro center yes micro center yeah yeah we haven't seen too many complaints about
[8432.82 --> 8437.46]  micro center so that's always i mean that's really the only gauge we have because we don't have personal
[8437.46 --> 8444.58]  experience sorting from any of these us only sites yep and i think that's the end thank you guys very
[8444.58 --> 8463.70]  much for tuning into the wan show we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
