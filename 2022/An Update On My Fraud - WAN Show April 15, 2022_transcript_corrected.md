[0.00 → 6.96] just don't cut the feed no matter what happens test your bleep button, and we're live
[6.96 → 12.54] welcome to the show everyone we have fantastic topics this week including
[12.54 → 18.94] Linus hopefully staying alive throughout the entire show um Linus potentially apologizing
[18.94 → 25.16] uh or at least clarifying some comments was I wrong about Elon Musk let's talk about that
[25.16 → 31.34] more at 11. I'm definitely going to be talking about the big update on the uh fraudulent the wire
[31.34 → 36.82] fraud that Yvonne and I were victims of yeah uh maybe as part of that I can give you guys some
[36.82 → 43.50] updates on the house and the pool and all of that good stuff because uh yeah that was it was
[43.50 → 50.10] the pool uh contractor that was ultimately the problem what else we got today uh but Tim Cook
[50.10 → 55.12] hates sideloading which is uh basically a continuation of a topic that we've talked about a few
[55.12 → 59.94] times yeah it's not exactly news, but it's uh definitely something that's in the news right
[59.94 → 68.42] now and also hey Honda screw you man yeah I'm actually so annoyed about this uh what is my
[68.42 → 70.42] stream deck doing how do I show the intro
[70.42 → 83.92] what happened there we go uh I think you can press it now can, I press it hey
[83.92 → 110.38] the show is brought to you by OVH cloud Squarespace and vulture it's a vulture filter I never know how to
[110.38 → 118.46] pronounce it let's jump right into our first topic it's story time ladies and gentlemen I am ready now
[118.46 → 124.36] that it is resolved to give you guys the full update on what happened with the wire fraud for
[124.36 → 130.64] those of you who haven't caught either the clip or the original wand show basically Yvonne and i
[130.64 → 137.44] got tricked I mean there's really there's really no other way to put it because if we had proper
[137.44 → 146.02] procedures in place but yeah we could have avoided accidentally sending I don't believe I have talked
[146.02 → 155.44] to you guys yet about the amount, but it was 90 000 Canadian dollars yeah dang had I told you that before
[155.44 → 161.32] yeah I did okay I did tell you that before the show so 90 grand they got us for, and you might be
[161.32 → 169.24] thinking Linus you know how could you guys be that stupid to wire 90 000 to someone without verifying who
[169.24 → 180.58] they were, and the answer is we did not consider you know that you're only as secure as the security of
[180.58 → 187.14] your business associates the weakest link right and so this particular contractor company I'm not gonna
[187.14 → 192.82] I'm not going to name and shame it's not it's not what I'm about as a general rule when it comes to my
[192.82 → 199.78] personal dealings and this was personal money which if you're familiar with how taxes work is actually a
[199.78 → 206.42] lot more painful than losing business money if I lose ninety thousand dollars through the business
[206.42 → 214.10] business that's ninety thousand dollars if I lose ninety thousand dollars personally that's the ninety
[214.10 → 220.18] thousand dollars that remains after I earned about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars and paid a whole
[220.18 → 226.90] bunch of it in taxes to the provincial and federal Canadian governments so losing ninety thousand dollars
[226.90 → 233.22] personally is a lot worse uh for our American friends watching that's somewhere in the neighbourhood of
[233.22 → 243.14] around sixty-five to seventy thousand us dollars so what happened was their email was compromised to
[243.14 → 249.86] the point where we were exchanging emails back and forth over a span of multiple days emails were coming
[249.86 → 257.38] back to us in the style uh documents on the letterhead because they had been in this company's email system for
[257.38 → 263.14] probably quite some time collecting information about their clients looking at the communication styles of their
[263.14 → 271.54] different employees, and they offered us a deal where if we paid for all the remaining landscaping and
[271.54 → 278.66] pool work up front they would offer us it was either a 10 or a 15 discount I can't remember exactly and
[278.66 → 287.14] Yvonne and I were in such a position in the project where we were like okay um our personal cash flow is
[287.14 → 292.50] actually okay right now this is all money that we know we're like we've set aside to pay for in the next
[292.50 → 298.50] three to six months anyway we've got it yeah I mean if there's a discount let's do a discount so we
[298.50 → 303.54] figured out the terms of how it was going to work, and they had us they had us wire it to them and they
[303.54 → 309.06] had a convincing story for why the wire was going to a bank in Toronto which is in Canada it's not like
[309.06 → 316.50] they had to send it to a bank in you know I don't know Syria or Nigeria or something right like it was
[316.50 → 323.14] going to a Canadian bank France so we sent the money and a little while later we got contacted
[323.14 → 331.22] by the contractor who in my opinion um did not do a good enough job of letting us know right away
[332.02 → 340.74] they should have told us immediately because you can typically recall a wire within the first 24 to 36
[340.74 → 347.78] hours after that who does it ever get tougher because if they withdraw that money if their
[347.78 → 353.70] account has it's basically handing people cash yeah it's a wire transfer cash money yeah so once it's
[353.70 → 363.62] moved out of the bank that it was sent to it's gone yes I'm talking about a scam I was defrauded for
[363.62 → 374.10] 90 000 Canadian dollars okay so I am ready to provide and this part I don't know on what happened
[374.10 → 381.70] so the first thing that we did obviously was we got in touch with our bank and our bank basically said
[383.46 → 390.66] like it's its been like over two days what do you want us to do we sent the money, and we're like
[390.66 → 397.46] we're like what we want you to do is tell us what to do yeah because I'm sure this isn't the first time
[397.46 → 404.58] it's come up yeah, and they said contact law enforcement now I am generally pretty supportive
[404.58 → 413.70] of law enforcement um I think that there are a lot of bad eggs I think there are a lot of bad eggs in
[413.70 → 421.30] any profession you could go to lawyers teachers law enforcement sports coaches, and you could find
[422.18 → 431.94] pedophiles murderers monsters um I do think that in positions of power people have tendencies that
[431.94 → 439.06] might bring out worse aspects of their personality so I'm not going to say that there is no correlation
[439.06 → 447.38] between people who abuse authority and authoritative figures so I will say that much but by and large
[447.38 → 455.30] I am I i I understand that it is a job that actually does need to be done anarchy is not better yeah um
[458.02 → 464.66] but things are the royal Canadian mounted police were utterly useless I think that's pretty normal yeah in
[464.66 → 473.22] this situation and I get it when you call the cops to your house because your 200 stereo was stolen um
[473.22 → 480.34] there is a there's a certain degree of what do you what do you want me to do about this it's its it's
[480.34 → 486.18] literally less than your insurance deductible and the cost of me doing paperwork to report this like I'm
[486.18 → 493.78] sorry this bad thing happened and that sucks you know I'd love to I can help you commiserate but
[493.78 → 500.02] realistically putting actual law enforcement resources into dealing with this petty crime is
[500.90 → 506.34] probably a bigger waste of taxpayer dollars than even me standing here and explaining it to you
[506.34 → 512.98] like i I understand that perspective even if I am very frustrated by it and that is a situation that i
[512.98 → 519.38] have in fact been in and yes maria z 200 is a lot of money for most people you're right, and it was for
[519.38 → 527.30] me when my car window got smashed and my stereo got taken but ultimately I also understand the cost
[528.10 → 536.50] of investigating this crime is much greater than 200 so in the big picture I like kind of get it
[536.50 → 549.06] but we are talking about 90 000, and you are telling me that it is not even worth I don't know picking up a
[549.06 → 557.06] phone and calling a Canadian bank who presumably would actually cooperate with you if you did the
[557.06 → 564.34] paperwork like you are supposed to no dude is its oh yeah you know what yeah that's rough too busy doing
[564.34 → 570.90] speeding that's rough afraid we can't do anything about that are you kidding me I mean maybe I've
[570.90 → 578.82] watched too many movies right read too many thrillers, but it seems to me that if the money went to a
[578.82 → 586.90] Canadian bank a Canadian person somewhere is going to have to retrieve it at some point, and it would
[586.90 → 594.50] probably be a pretty good idea to find them and put them in jail no someone probably registered that
[594.50 → 600.42] bank account they might have also like identity theft you know jacked a bank account sure well then
[600.42 → 605.70] that person should probably know their identity was stolen instead of us just ignoring it was one thing
[605.70 → 611.78] allowing it to continue is like by investigating smaller crimes you might uh unveil someone that's
[611.78 → 616.66] doing an extremely large amount of smaller crimes, but that's uh it's not always going to work
[618.42 → 626.82] but yeah so nothing so Nicola run says no, no no and no every crime has to be investigated I mean
[626.82 → 638.10] so like what are you doing yeah I mean I think that's a pretty good example fund philosophically i
[638.10 → 645.54] guess you know we could debate this but I live in the real world where if Luke steals that pen
[645.54 → 652.18] realistically dude the only consequence is going to be me calling him out when we finally do an intel
[652.18 → 661.62] extreme tech upgrade um the point is that there actually are different tiers of criminal liability
[661.62 → 669.46] depending on the severity I would prefer that more time went into investigating like murders and
[670.34 → 675.94] and other things I don't even necessarily want to bring up then investigated like the Game Boy that
[675.94 → 681.94] was stolen from me when I was like 12. I was really sad that heavily impacted me at that age
[681.94 → 689.14] yep, but it's its genuinely just not as important as certain other things so you know man oh man i
[689.14 → 693.70] see I'm trying I don't want to have I don't want any hot takes today, but we're already there yeah I know
[693.70 → 698.58] i guess we're already there it's like hot zone ladies and gentlemen it's like uh you know for
[698.58 → 705.94] for me how's that classist for me life is your life is essentially all the time that you have
[705.94 → 714.74] combined right and the way that I see it the severity of a crime is directly uh is directly
[714.74 → 722.74] correlated not not not necessarily one for one but is correlated with the amount of that time that it
[722.74 → 730.50] steals or that it robs someone else of so obviously from from that perspective
[730.50 → 738.66] the murder of an infant child could be considered to be the worst crime because you have robbed that
[738.66 → 745.94] entire undefined potential life and accomplishment what could have been contributed to the
[745.94 → 752.82] world okay not only have you done that, but you have also probably damaged or completely destroyed the
[752.82 → 759.22] lives of the parents and the other family members who brought that child into the world and the greater the
[759.22 → 764.18] magnitude of this destruction of life the worse it is that's sort of my general philosophy and
[764.74 → 770.34] from Frau, and you can kind of take pretty much anything whether it's whether it's rape
[770.34 → 775.78] or whether it's theft and you can bring it to time if you steal a hundred dollars from someone
[775.78 → 781.62] who works minimum wage you have stolen a day you stole a day of their life is the way that I see it or more I think
[782.66 → 789.06] uh, uh it depends where you are yeah I think it's 14 something way too low basically everywhere
[789.38 → 799.78] um bc minimum wage 15 1565 so yeah my math is about right so you have essentially stolen a day
[799.78 → 808.58] of that person's life from my point of view and so it's really it's really frustrating to me particularly
[808.58 → 815.70] financial crimes are a big one when someone steals like a billion dollars to me that is an enormous deal
[815.70 → 821.86] like you have actually you have actually stolen the waking hours of hundreds or thousands upon
[821.86 → 828.82] thousands of people that they will never have back they chose to spend that time earning money you took
[828.82 → 835.70] it therefore they spent that time earning nothing and that has a psychological toll as well
[836.50 → 841.06] as well as just that time that's lost so that's that's the way that I see it and when someone is
[841.06 → 850.50] conducting this kind of scam not only have they taken an extremely large amount of labour created wealth
[851.06 → 856.18] but they're probably doing it to others in fact we know for a fact they tried to do it to others because
[856.18 → 862.02] they accessed the systems of this contractor, and we were not people at the same time the only ones they
[862.02 → 868.50] hit yeah and so to me, it was outrageous that they kind of looked at it and went we're we're not going to
[868.50 → 873.62] do anything about this so that makes it more interesting to me because like I mentioned with
[873.62 → 880.50] the uh the stereo example like by investigating that one you might find that that is a not a
[880.50 → 884.98] single occurrence right no and if they stole stereos from like hundreds of people than okay this is a
[884.98 → 890.90] huge deal and that, but they do actually do that oh yeah like i you know obviously I'm in like
[890.90 → 895.86] my neighbourhood watch Facebook try to notice stuff like that so obviously I'm not saying you shouldn't
[895.86 → 900.42] continue to report crimes even if you know they're not going to investigate we go out of our way even
[900.42 → 904.18] if we know they're not going to do anything to make sure that we report everything whether it's through
[904.18 → 909.94] the business or whether it's personally because like you said once they start to notice these patterns
[909.94 → 913.94] actually they do apprehend like petty criminals quite often so
[917.70 → 925.06] I was very frustrated by the response from both our bank who I didn't expect to be able to do anything
[925.06 → 930.98] but I hoped would be able to these are next steps i yeah I hoped would it didn't go nowhere it went
[930.98 → 937.94] to a Canadian bank account therefore somebody has to get it at some point right so let's figure out who
[937.94 → 945.46] that is found out if they've been defrauded or had their identity stolen right find out who they're
[945.46 → 951.22] cooperating with there's got to be some way to track this money as it moves whether it's within the
[951.22 → 957.14] country or around the world I thought that's the whole point of a centralized banking system no
[958.58 → 965.86] isn't it yeah sorry aren't there like actual anti-money laundering and anti-fraud laws and
[965.86 → 971.06] policies and procedures in place aren't there mechanisms for finding out where money came from
[971.06 → 978.82] and where it went isn't it all electronic how is it even possible that we can't figure out who it
[978.82 → 985.46] went to yeah kind of nuts it is kind of nuts I was stunned locked there for a second because someone
[985.46 → 992.50] told me to look up the minimum wage in Georgia and Wyoming and I was like okay, and they're
[992.50 → 999.38] apparently five dollars and fifteen cents, but there's a there's a federal uh fair labour standards act which
[999.38 → 1006.98] means that they have to pay the federal minimum wage which is seven dollars and 25 cents 58 for an
[1006.98 → 1017.38] eight-hour work day okay dang if we want to start talking about raising the American minimum wage we
[1017.38 → 1023.54] are going to end up in hot take territory extremely quickly all I'm saying is its far from 100 bucks but
[1023.54 → 1029.46] yeah um and when you're a lot closer to 100 Canadian dollars you're saying that's true that's true
[1030.10 → 1035.06] when you only make 58 bucks the distance to 100 bucks is going to feel extremely far
[1035.62 → 1041.54] um yep but anyway anyway yeah so it didn't work you didn't get it back so
[1043.86 → 1047.22] what happened was I am lucky enough
[1047.22 → 1054.66] I am lucky enough in my life and the personal contacts that I have okay that I was able to reach
[1055.54 → 1063.38] someone who knows someone who has some kind of connection at the financial institution that received
[1064.02 → 1064.50] the money
[1067.46 → 1070.82] they were not supposed to find out if it was still there and tell me
[1070.82 → 1083.38] oh my okay got it I think I understand are we stopping there what happened okay was somehow
[1083.38 → 1088.74] and I have no idea how this occurred the money was frozen in the recipient's account
[1090.50 → 1098.18] while an investigation was conducted okay we got it back two days ago wow not by the RCMP, so there's
[1098.18 → 1104.10] no police involvement not as far as I'm aware just the banks uh i I don't know the exact mechanism so
[1104.10 → 1107.94] it could be that the police did end up being involved I imagine they might have been involved
[1107.94 → 1116.34] at some point what I suspect is that our own provincial RCMP or municipal detachment or whatever
[1116.34 → 1122.02] didn't feel like dealing with something over provincial lines so once it was flagged by an organization
[1122.02 → 1127.38] in the same province that the crime appeared to have been committed it may have actually received
[1127.38 → 1133.94] some proper attention but the bigger problem here the bigger problem is that that's what it that's
[1133.94 → 1139.94] what it took exactly anyone this before anyone whether they were defrauded of a hundred dollars
[1140.58 → 1149.22] fifty dollars a hundred thousand dollars should be able to figure out where that that fraudulent
[1149.22 → 1158.02] transaction went and this should not be complicated in the digital age yeah how is that even possible
[1160.82 → 1163.78] yeah and it shouldn't like any time that it takes
[1165.06 → 1170.82] the public influence that that one of us has in order to fix a problem the system's broken yes a hundred
[1170.82 → 1176.18] percent yeah yeah it's not good like I'm happy for you that it was solved but also
[1176.18 → 1183.38] that's like that's still big bad um at least you got that should I transition here go for it at
[1183.38 → 1189.78] least you got that money back because now you can afford to buy uh a NFT that was originally
[1190.50 → 1196.74] 2.9 million dollars but now as far as my understanding goes is only 6 800 bucks
[1196.74 → 1202.42] it's amazing you got your 90 grand back you've got way more than enough money to buy this NFT that is
[1202.42 → 1210.82] definitely worth uh almost three million dollars can I just say can I just say that I was delighted to
[1210.82 → 1218.98] read this headline this is great this is so funny okay this is the uh original article is from the
[1218.98 → 1224.74] guardian here massive props the guardian love you guys I need to donate I haven't yet I really should
[1224.74 → 1234.66] uh this is the Mona Lisa of the digital world says crypto entrepreneur cent estate who bought the NFT in
[1234.66 → 1244.98] march 2021 2.9 million dollars for a NFT of Jack Dorsey's first tweet which to be clear guys it is
[1244.98 → 1254.58] non-fungible okay this cannot simply be replicated by right-clicking and save as oh Geez it's non-fungible
[1254.58 → 1263.62] oh man inspect element type it in yourself beautiful and you know the last thing you would want is to
[1263.62 → 1269.94] spend 2.9 million dollars on a fungible token if you could have a non-fungible one
[1273.06 → 1280.74] so he bought it in March 2021 because this is definitely a very valuable sensible asset one of my
[1280.74 → 1285.70] favourite quotes in here is when he's when he's putting it up for sale he says it's important
[1287.38 → 1292.02] have you read this it's sorry this is actually just amazing and it's its almost difficult to get
[1292.02 → 1298.74] through its important for me who wants to buy it I will not sell this NFT to anyone because I do not
[1298.74 → 1307.30] think everyone deserves this NFT it's a picture of a tweet okay and this is great come on so he bought it in
[1307.30 → 1315.86] March 2021 for 2.9 million dollars but apparently his efforts to resell it regardless of who's actually
[1315.86 → 1325.46] allowed to bid have apparently been uh pretty unsuccessful so far with a top bid of just six
[1325.46 → 1332.02] thousand eight hundred dollars nice which is a lot of money but compared to 2.9 million
[1332.02 → 1337.46] like literally doesn't change the number it's still 2.9 million that he's losing
[1339.78 → 1349.94] amazing oh man yeah Conrad's like give you 350 for it best I can do i just
[1351.70 → 1360.26] I find it I okay with cryptocurrency we are actually in the process of trying to figure out a way to
[1360.26 → 1366.74] accept cryptocurrency for some of our products and services I think that cryptocurrency does have
[1367.54 → 1375.06] the potential to have a value i I think that with refinement it can be an amazing technology a force
[1375.06 → 1383.94] for change maybe a force for good in the world that much I can say NFTs yeah I don't know there it's just
[1383.94 → 1392.18] there's such a blatantly obvious drift I think there's also probably utility there as well sure
[1392.18 → 1397.30] I think it just essentially has like maybe if there's is there's I don't even know if there has
[1397.30 → 1401.06] been because I haven't looked into it enough but maybe there's some amount of utility that's already
[1401.06 → 1405.54] being used for it that's actually legit and then like 90 of the scams let's talk about the dumb stuff
[1405.54 → 1411.62] the games' industry is doing with NFTs right so NFTs one of the big pitches that I've heard for NFTs in
[1411.62 → 1417.70] gaming is that you can have a NFT of say some digital artwork that could even be transported
[1417.70 → 1424.98] across game games right okay except here's the problem with that what's the difference between
[1424.98 → 1437.14] having it centralized and stored on valve servers or uh Ea servers or Ubisoft servers or Nintendo's servers
[1437.14 → 1442.66] or whatever the case may be what's the value of having it stored somewhere else or having this
[1442.66 → 1449.86] token if ultimately the exact same actions that could cause it to stop working uh like if that
[1449.86 → 1455.94] that particular game it shuts down or whatever right so they delete your your your digital item
[1456.50 → 1460.18] would also cause it to stop working because now you just own a digital item for a game they shut down
[1460.18 → 1466.10] like what's the difference also, also real chads just don't buy any skins whether you can transfer
[1466.10 → 1473.46] them to game or not it's true so you don't need it anyway no utility just don't buy it
[1473.46 → 1482.50] it's true the day i i I'm I'm making a promise I'm making a commitment right now the day that one of my
[1482.50 → 1491.94] kids spends money on a digital on a digital thing to look at they're off the computer for a
[1491.94 → 1498.42] quarter for a quarter for a quarter for a kid that's a long it's a long time they will learn that's a long
[1498.42 → 1505.70] and they will learn a value I remember like if I got grounded for like a month it felt like an eternity
[1506.42 → 1510.74] that's a that's a that's a minute one more thing before we get off this topic um
[1510.74 → 1518.18] um he said okay it's not a said while announcing the NFT sale in a tweet on the 6th of April
[1518.18 → 1525.62] as Davis pledged to give 50 of the proceeds which he expected to be at least 25 million dollars
[1528.66 → 1534.82] to charity oh hey thanks, thanks for the hypothetical money for your hypothetical asset
[1534.82 → 1542.02] so good oh man I mean if you're going to spend money you should at least actually get something in
[1542.02 → 1554.58] return why don't we head over to lttstore.com we have actually got some very good stuff this week
[1554.58 → 1560.42] first of all guys if you want a merch message to show up, so those are those little messages that show
[1560.42 → 1565.94] up uh at the bottom of the stream ooh as long as I'm not in a window like this have we thought of
[1565.94 → 1572.90] that Luke do merch messages do anything when we're like this no they do not oh uh okay uh well uh
[1572.90 → 1577.54] hopefully you didn't send them just need the banners to be added to these now yeah I guess we'll need
[1577.54 → 1582.10] to do that okay cool we'll figure that out later anyway if you pick something up on the store while
[1582.10 → 1588.90] we're streaming you will get a chance to fill in a merch message, and it'll either pop up or our producer
[1588.90 → 1593.38] will reply to you, or we might address it on the show, and we've got a couple of cool things for
[1593.38 → 1601.22] you guys to check out uh Sarah could not resist the urge to create an eggshell t-shirt yeah what
[1601.22 → 1609.06] what is this and oh from the paint rant oh this is going to be really cool we're actually doing something
[1609.06 → 1615.14] special with this shirt this is a pre-sale so we are going to print only the exact number of shirts
[1615.14 → 1619.54] that we order, so this is a digital reference mock-up that Sarah did are you going to damage the
[1620.66 → 1630.18] six of the shirts they will be randomly selected one of each size will not be eggshell
[1630.74 → 1637.06] they will be satin, and they will be covered in little masking tape pieces just like the walls of
[1637.06 → 1644.90] my house there you go they will also come with an uh a note that I'm actually I'm going to write it I'm
[1644.90 → 1650.50] going to write it live on the show I'll create a note we're going to do six copies okay then we're going to like
[1650.50 → 1657.78] label them one of six two of six all the way to six of six, and you will get an ugly
[1657.78 → 1665.38] an ugly stupid satin shirt, and you will also get a little note that i I will write you here on
[1665.38 → 1670.50] the here on the show today that's amazing that that's it that's the big that's the big uh
[1670.50 → 1677.30] that's the big pitch so you might get you might get eggshell shirt or I might decide to screw you
[1677.30 → 1684.18] over with satin now actually ah I'm glad we're talking about this because some folks pointed out
[1684.18 → 1692.10] that um satin they said that it actually has more resin than eggshell maybe that's a regional thing
[1692.10 → 1699.86] because not only is every satin paint that I've ever seen here in Canada uh more matte than eggshell
[1699.86 → 1707.06] but I actually checked the exact product they were using on the like master painter whatever
[1707.06 → 1715.86] organization thing that like rates paints, and it's its it's resin content its hardness was lower than
[1715.86 → 1722.74] an eggshell product from that same brand there's also some confusion interesting um in Sherwin
[1722.74 → 1726.18] Williams so that's the brand of paint that we're using I wish we'd just use Coverdale I'm much more
[1726.18 → 1731.06] comfortable with their products anyway there's some confusion in the way that Sherwin Williams labels
[1731.06 → 1738.10] their paint, and they apparently do have some products where satin and eggshell are used interchangeably
[1738.10 → 1745.14] at least by them but as for whether they are actually the same uh that I don't know so there
[1745.14 → 1752.02] you go there you go by satin no by satin I mean the paint finish this was a rant that I did during a
[1752.02 → 1758.82] live stream and then we also uploaded as a clip to leg clips yeah so if you guys uh if you guys want a
[1758.82 → 1765.38] an eggshell shirt then hey cool go for it the real product the not limited time one that we are actually
[1765.38 → 1771.54] launching is a perfect one man we have been working on this one for far too long considering
[1771.54 → 1779.78] how of a sweater simple it looks on the surface it's a waffle like a waffle pattern fabric long
[1779.78 → 1786.66] sleeve shirt it's made of a hundred percent organic cotton super minimal LTT branding there's just a
[1786.66 → 1792.58] little tiny tag on the bottom you can barely even see it down here it's available in charcoal
[1792.58 → 1802.66] as well as ultramarine and man is this thing ever comfortable and breathable and it just I think
[1802.66 → 1808.90] man the fashion team just nailed this one I like a lot I'm also seeing some people in chat say weird
[1808.90 → 1814.82] timing um i sort of thought the same thing and that comes out when it comes out and then remembered that
[1814.82 → 1823.46] i I was out for a run yesterday and it was negative one degree Celsius outside so like maybe it's not
[1823.46 → 1830.50] I don't know really as a thing yeah like i you know just saying and it'll still be available when it's
[1830.50 → 1837.06] slightly less weird timing so who cares yeah it's its it's great they just they absolutely nailed
[1837.06 → 1842.66] it like it is manages to be like nice and fitted in the chest it hangs nicely uh but it's still it's like
[1842.66 → 1849.70] super stretchable oh yeah so like if you're is you're a little wider in the know girth parts
[1850.26 → 1854.50] then it can accommodate that as well so yeah we're really excited about this one
[1856.18 → 1860.82] real excited so you guys yeah you're going to want to go check that out I don't know how many we have in
[1860.82 → 1868.74] stock but um wow okay apparently it works pretty well for the ladies to that's Sarah she manages to
[1868.74 → 1874.66] make anything look good look at that that's awesome oh yeah and of course you can mouse over
[1874.66 → 1879.86] and you can see who the model is and what size they're wearing so if you know see a body
[1879.86 → 1884.26] type that you're like oh yeah that's um yeah I'm kind of like that it matches me a little bit better
[1884.26 → 1890.18] then you can person I'm shopping for you can scroll through all our pictures and get a good pretty good
[1890.18 → 1900.34] idea of how that's going to fit on you all right let's move on shall we our next topic is called Linus
[1900.34 → 1909.54] apologized to daddy Elon okay I had some takes last week that were sort of half based on articles that i
[1909.54 → 1915.22] half read over the last five years some of which were a long time ago and the bottom line for me was
[1915.22 → 1927.06] that I don't think that Elon Musk is a particularly considerate and kind thoughtful uh person is my
[1927.06 → 1931.94] take based on his public actions we were talking about him purchasing twitter so that doesn't and
[1931.94 → 1941.46] his willingness to uh his willingness to put his own desires above those of others unilaterally is sort
[1941.46 → 1949.78] of I guess how I could summarize it um basically being a douchebag right just kind of going yeah
[1949.78 → 1954.98] that's that's the way that I wanted and that last time everyone else can just I don't know not believe
[1954.98 → 1962.42] we're sucked a popsicle so basically we're going to go through everything I talked about last week I had
[1962.42 → 1968.90] the I had the writing team go through and clarify some of the things I got wrong expand upon some of the
[1968.90 → 1976.02] things I got not so wrong and I'm just gonna kind of go through it here so uh misleading statements
[1976.02 → 1982.66] and or posturing around charity um and or you know hey look at that good thing I'm doing look at me i
[1982.66 → 1988.02] would like attention sort of actions so we've got the trapped Thai kid situation uh this was the source
[1988.02 → 1995.94] of the whole Pedro guy lawsuit um musk helps by sending a submarine okay so no I don't think this is
[1995.94 → 2001.38] entirely fair so the okay the Pedro guy thing yeah is its own thing I don't want to address really
[2001.38 → 2010.18] stupid that was really stupid 100 I'm on board he was asked for help, and he was asked to design a
[2010.18 → 2016.34] backup solution, and he brought the thing there, and then he left it with them and when the rescue was
[2016.34 → 2021.38] successful he said great job to the rescuers all that kind of stuff and then there was this fight that
[2021.38 → 2027.62] happened afterwards, and he called the dude Pedro guy or whatever, but it was above board until then
[2027.62 → 2034.90] and the guy did lose the defamation suit but what does that probably because mean big bank take
[2034.90 → 2040.18] little bank more than anything else i I don't know but yeah I know that guy was like attacking him first
[2040.18 → 2047.22] that doesn't make it okay um etc but like but saying but putting it in like helps is that's not fair
[2047.22 → 2052.02] he was asked to help, and he helped to donate ventilators this one was pretty funny to me
[2052.58 → 2057.22] early in the covid pandemic musk committed to donating ventilators to hospitals they turned out
[2057.22 → 2063.62] to be CPAP machines which is not the same thing don't forget he was a civet denialism and in my opinion
[2063.62 → 2071.38] his behaviour towards his workers during the pandemic was extremely antilabour and when you are antilabour you
[2071.38 → 2082.98] are anti basically 99 of people it's that simple um yeah not, not cool at all Starlink in Ukraine so
[2082.98 → 2088.82] Starlink worked with USA to send 5000 Starlink terminals after Ukrainian prime minister uh Mikhael
[2090.02 → 2094.98] Fedora asked Elon on Twitter to activate satellites for use in Ukraine to which Elon replied Starlink
[2094.98 → 2100.74] service is now active in Ukraine yes they are satellites uh upon receiving the satellites Fedora thanked
[2100.74 → 2105.70] Elon again on Twitter probably the most effective charity to date they've got hold on this is
[2105.70 → 2112.98] another uh this is another one I okay so if you look into this it was if I remember correctly the
[2112.98 → 2118.34] majority of the direct expenditure was from USAID there is some stuff that was thrown in from Starlink
[2118.34 → 2121.70] though and if I remember correctly Starlink is planning to support them for longer than
[2122.26 → 2130.18] USAID paid for etc etc etc all right uh lawsuit against the founder uh the lawsuit was reversed martin
[2130.18 → 2135.46] Eberhard sued Elon for libel slander and breach of contract it alleged that Elon pushed Eberhard out
[2135.46 → 2140.34] of the company the case was probably settled nothing was publicly disclosed um
[2144.26 → 2147.70] okay there's a bit of editorializing here, but it's not mine so I'm going to go with it
[2148.18 → 2152.90] uh horse's guess is that probably Elon fired Eberhard because he was mad about not being in the limelight as
[2152.90 → 2158.50] much as the co-founder uh there's a quote here from Elon I'm not merely unmentioned in the New York
[2158.50 → 2163.70] times coverage but whereas Martin is actually referred to as the chairman okay, and we've got
[2163.70 → 2170.42] Elon's treatment of his family so I don't have a ton of respect for people who don't treat their
[2170.42 → 2176.02] family well we don't have a ton of information about the kids other than that they have weird names
[2176.02 → 2183.62] that seem to be designed solely to get headlines um the kind of attention-seeking behaviour honestly
[2183.62 → 2191.46] strikes me as extremely childish but that sort of is what it is as for your kid a weird name is like
[2192.50 → 2198.42] as for the whole treatment of sos uh Vanity Fair interview from March grimes complained about her
[2198.42 → 2203.38] poor living conditions um like bro wouldn't even get a new mattress there was a hole in her side of
[2203.38 → 2210.26] the bed uh he suggested they replace it with her mattress bro does not live like a billionaire uh why do we
[2210.26 → 2214.26] live in this insecure forty thousand dollar house where the neighbours like film us and there's no
[2214.26 → 2219.06] security and I'm eating peanut butter for eight days in a row she does frequently speak positively
[2219.06 → 2224.50] of Elon um her admiration for his accomplishments plans for Mars electric cars future of humanity etc
[2224.50 → 2229.54] still seems to be content having him in her life as for his first wife seems to be much less fond
[2229.54 → 2234.98] describes herself as a starter wife um filed for divorce then six weeks later got engaged to a second
[2234.98 → 2242.10] wife that usually doesn't happen unless there was some kind of lead up to it um Elon took very little
[2242.10 → 2245.94] time before trying to ensure she would not be able to have any impact on his wealth in the form of
[2245.94 → 2252.26] post-nuptial agreements that's cool that's like that's partnership um I guess as someone who feels that
[2252.26 → 2258.58] a marriage is a partnership i I have zero respect for that kind of behaviour um he would apparently
[2258.58 → 2262.58] continuously criticize her saying things like if you were my employee I would fire you
[2262.58 → 2269.62] um referred to her grief after losing their child to side as emotionally manipulated pressured her to dye
[2269.62 → 2276.90] her hair more blonde um oh this the side one is really brutal yeah there's just I mean again this is all
[2276.90 → 2292.26] alleged um, but you know we've got anyway back to the twitter thing so yeah I'm I'm not a fan
[2293.14 → 2299.46] and you know what you can be but I don't have to be and I'm not my whole point on the clarifications and
[2299.46 → 2306.90] honestly just to be like completely real this doesn't fully satisfy my desire for clarifications
[2306.90 → 2314.74] like a lot of these are still editorialized as I would say like the trap kids thing yep that's
[2314.74 → 2320.18] fair that wasn't properly covered the satellites' thing was not properly covered etc uh well thankfully we have
[2320.18 → 2327.22] you here thank you Luke yeah hooray um if you're going to attack people you should just do it properly
[2327.22 → 2333.06] that I'm not I'm not a fan that's fine I'm not a fan of Elon i I had the same feedback for people back
[2333.06 → 2338.82] when Trump was President of the United States and people used to just say like oh orange man bad it's
[2338.82 → 2344.42] like you're not you're not accomplishing anything if anything you're attacking that weekly is just like
[2344.42 → 2351.14] offering up you to be like parried more aggressively like just if you're gonna if you're going to go at
[2351.14 → 2356.34] them just go for the throat so it's better like that it's better to yeah better to clarify and be
[2356.34 → 2363.70] able to back up your statements what so what do you think about the attempt to purchase all of
[2363.70 → 2376.42] twitter for 43 true it's not trillion is it pretty sure that's a typo billion 43 billion um I find it
[2377.62 → 2393.06] I find it deeply ironic that there is a certain subset of um of people that are looking for saviours from
[2393.06 → 2403.62] the elite and turn to figures like Donald Trump and or Elon Musk the likes yeah yeah yeah
[2404.34 → 2415.86] for sure these people's lives and experiences are nothing like yours they are actually the elite and
[2415.86 → 2425.22] if you are expecting someone who has so such disdain for the questions and commentary of others
[2425.22 → 2431.94] that they actually dissolved their press relations department for tesla so that they wouldn't have to
[2431.94 → 2438.26] answer uncomfortable questions if you imagine that kind of thin-skinned individual is going to be some
[2438.26 → 2448.10] kind of champion for free speech or for the rights of the people i I don't follow you i I'm sorry I can't
[2448.10 → 2454.82] go where you're going I expected this type of stuff to get in the dock as well, but there 's's
[2454.82 → 2461.46] examples of him trying to like squash or or at least heavily negatively reacting to free speech as
[2461.46 → 2466.50] well like there was some and uh this is fair are we going to talk about the private jet tracker or
[2466.50 → 2470.90] something else the private jet tracker is interesting sure is, but that isn't what I was going to talk
[2470.90 → 2477.22] about um the private jet tracker guy by the way has tweeted out talking about how like if Elon
[2477.22 → 2483.62] buys twitter he feels like he's going to get banned um, but there 's's other stuff like i I should
[2483.62 → 2489.62] have prepared this for the show to make claims on it but um there's like i I believe there was a
[2489.62 → 2496.42] who wrote an article about tesla that he didn't like uh, but they had like pre-purchased a model x or
[2496.42 → 2502.82] something so he cancelled their order, and it's just like come on man like there 's's a lot of
[2502.82 → 2510.98] there are a lot of examples of like yeah and like man guys you know I see comments like well who's going
[2510.98 → 2518.82] to take on the elite other than the elite us everyone yeah everyone not the elite are not going to
[2518.82 → 2526.42] save you replacing your your all-powerful god king with another all-powerful god king never
[2526.42 → 2540.18] worked for anyone no literally never worked its bad news dude so um you know it's honestly it's its
[2540.18 → 2545.46] hard for me, it's hard for me to fathom because sometimes I think he's playing 4d chess and other
[2545.46 → 2551.22] other times I think he's just behaving like an actual child and trolling people on the internet
[2551.22 → 2559.30] so is he is this some kind of scheme to uh grossly increase the value of the nine point whatever
[2559.30 → 2565.30] percent stake that he already bought to make a quick buck is it honestly he does gamer moves like that all
[2565.30 → 2571.22] the time I wouldn't be surprised yeah yeah could be that is it just to is it just to be in the headlines
[2571.22 → 2577.38] because as far as I can tell he can't go 48 hours without just doing something so everybody's
[2577.38 → 2582.58] looking at him there's I've seen some claims that there's other stuff going on with him, I don't know
[2583.22 → 2588.42] um like things that he's doing at his different companies that are bad I don't know I'm not informed
[2588.42 → 2592.98] on this and that he's trying to make splashes with this twitter thing to distract from it, I don't know
[2592.98 → 2602.90] um dude uh dude uses social media stuff for super gamer moves so yep I would be very SUS of like
[2604.42 → 2608.66] I mean you should just be really suspicious of anything that anyone with that amount of power
[2608.66 → 2615.30] does ever people like boosting stocks is illegal yeah so was not disclosing in the correct amount of
[2615.30 → 2621.14] time that he had acquired the stake that he had acquired before, but this is like this is what I'm talking
[2621.14 → 2629.78] about where for some reason that kind of white collar criminality doesn't get prosecuted you know
[2629.78 → 2637.62] you have someone literally take 300 out of the out of the cash register of a convenience store and they
[2637.62 → 2644.66] are going to the slammer oh yeah and and and so they should, it's traumatic for the staff and and and
[2644.66 → 2652.90] like it's an it's a crime that it's a crime, but then you know you manipulate the value of a stock
[2653.86 → 2659.30] you don't disclose that you're buying large amounts of it, so this is what happened he didn't disclose
[2659.30 → 2666.18] correctly that he was acquiring quietly behind the scenes a vast amount of Twitter stock and then disclosed
[2666.18 → 2672.58] it after he was supposed to and was like boom I have it all now and what typically happens if you're
[2672.58 → 2678.66] not stealthy about it which you're not allowed to be is as a high profile figure acquiring a bunch of
[2678.66 → 2683.70] stock that gets in the headlines, and it drives the price up so what he did is he saved himself a bunch
[2683.70 → 2688.34] of money at the expense of all the people that he bought from, and then he announces it to the price
[2688.34 → 2694.18] spikes right yeah one of my favourite ones is just like and this is speaking as a Canadian before the
[2694.18 → 2700.18] Americans get all spicy um as far as I can tell just western countries in general uh politicians
[2700.98 → 2705.94] being able to track their stock portfolios I've heard uh I haven't looked into this directly but
[2705.94 → 2712.26] I've heard that Wall Street bets has started tracking uh like politicians investments and finding that
[2712.26 → 2719.46] it's like hey if we just follow them you get really rich because you'll see they'll make like weird moves
[2719.46 → 2724.90] right and then some information will be publicized, and then it's like oh I guess they knew ahead of
[2724.90 → 2730.82] everyone else so they made like investment stuff based on if it's so brutal the fact that that's
[2730.82 → 2738.66] just like oh that's fine it's like what ever short of infinity careful this comment says you
[2738.66 → 2742.42] should go to jail for stealing a candy bar is the hottest take Linus has ever had
[2744.18 → 2751.06] I didn't say that I said you would, I also said it was 300 from the cash register which implies that
[2751.06 → 2754.98] someone was coerced into giving it to you, it's not a candy which is a huge deal so it's not
[2754.98 → 2763.06] a candy bar I didn't say you should, I said you would so real careful I've had a lot of words
[2763.06 → 2776.02] put into my mouth over the last little bit here oh man anyway um yeah
[2776.02 → 2792.26] so I think that um the whole thing is a stupid publicity stunt personally um i i I don't uh I don't
[2793.38 → 2800.34] yeah i I'm I'm very I'm much more interested in this than any other story that I've heard that's
[2800.34 → 2805.94] highly related to this lately because I feel like I almost have personal investment in just watching
[2805.94 → 2811.38] twitter burn because I hate the platform that's fair and if like there's a bunch of people posting
[2811.38 → 2818.18] like if he buys it we should all leave I'm like please buy it then because if everyone just leaves
[2818.18 → 2823.06] I would be stoked yeah can we can can i can I have a hot take though here that's sort of it's
[2823.06 → 2827.78] related to what you were talking about before politicians and investments yeah how is that a thing
[2828.82 → 2835.70] oh yeah I don't know honestly, honestly right left centrist I don't care it's all the
[2835.70 → 2842.74] side we should all agree that that should not be it's like how is that how is it open for debate
[2842.74 → 2848.18] that if you are able to affect the policies that affect the valuation of these companies
[2848.74 → 2854.50] that that is a clear conflict of interest genuinely inside information on how things are going to be
[2854.50 → 2865.14] affected even like I'm I'm just a lowly media tech media peon and I'm sitting here going you know yes i
[2865.14 → 2872.18] i I own zero stake I made an exception for framework whether they succeed in their mission
[2872.18 → 2878.50] I don't know I explained my whole reasoning for it but that was an utterly exceptional circumstance
[2878.50 → 2887.38] that should not be the norm like I shouldn't be just running around buying AMD shares even if I know
[2887.94 → 2893.54] that it's going to crush it like man do you know how often I look at what happened to AMD's shares
[2893.54 → 2898.02] after I made that video being like you should buy AMD stock I am not a financial advisor but you should
[2898.02 → 2902.42] probably buy AMD stock right now like or I like I think I said I wish I could buy it or something like
[2902.42 → 2909.06] that like I knew where they were heading because just as someone who follows the industry closely I knew
[2909.06 → 2916.02] that nobody else had anything for at least two years and I know that a lot of the time stock number go up
[2916.74 → 2922.98] because of just good news, and so I knew it was going to be a endless parade of good news for AMD
[2922.98 → 2928.74] and I knew there was going to be at least a solid six to 18 months of bad news for intel that was going
[2928.74 → 2933.22] to just make them go like this, and they let they I think they tripled or something like that in that
[2933.22 → 2938.82] time I'm sitting here going to have some freaking restraint you people
[2941.78 → 2947.78] yeah like whether we're talking Nancy Pelosi or oh man who was that yeah it's both sides of the aisle
[2947.78 → 2953.38] it's not particularly egregious uh one on the right I can't remember well it doesn't matter this
[2953.38 → 2959.94] this is like brutal trading on inside political government information in order to make tons of money is
[2959.94 → 2965.78] a bipartisan seem to agree that they want to do that like when you look at like the people
[2965.78 → 2970.98] that have been uh successful at trading it's, but it's both colours it's its absolutely red and blue
[2970.98 → 2975.14] all over the place it's uh it's interesting anyway
[2979.14 → 2984.98] yeah I'm just mad yeah me too okay let's talk about something else let's let's do some merch messages let's
[2984.98 → 2991.54] let's talk about how I made some money like actually you know producing something that's of value not just
[2991.54 → 2998.82] manipulating people's fears and sentiment about you know their gambling stocks
[3000.26 → 3008.90] don't go in doge don'tTS to the moon I own no Dogecoin no zero me neither hit me Dan
[3008.90 → 3015.46] oh yeah oh we have a have a stand-in producer today yeah, yeah well first one's about paint
[3016.10 → 3020.58] ready to talk about paint I'm ready to talk about paint some more are there really 22 incoming ones
[3020.58 → 3026.90] I can't keep up you can't keep up what are people what's going on today it's holy crap what the heck
[3026.90 → 3031.38] it's my first time doing march messages there were two messages in between when I said holy crap
[3031.38 → 3035.46] and there's another one now I can't read them fast enough there's another one please help
[3036.42 → 3038.88] there are new or there's another one there are new orders in the world
[3038.90 → 3042.34] coming in every two days there's another one this has been the whole time I thought this is what
[3042.34 → 3048.74] bell dealt with what the hell is happening uh okay you know what no you stay on the
[3048.74 → 3052.10] incoming ones okay yeah I've got a pitch for you, I've got a pitch for you before we do this
[3052.10 → 3054.42] yeah what about help flamethrowers
[3058.58 → 3059.06] got him
[3059.06 → 3066.02] so good all right it sounds boring to me
[3070.58 → 3077.38] all right uh what am I looking at here this is from anonymous hey love the work you guys are doing
[3077.38 → 3087.38] against Russia it's not that enough hey Linus the so and I recently bought a new house, and we're
[3087.38 → 3093.22] looking to repaint neither of us love eggshell I was wondering if there are any other colour slash brands
[3093.22 → 3100.34] that you would recommend okay common misconception eggshell is not a colour because eggs actually come in
[3100.34 → 3106.18] many different colours depending on the kind of chicken that they get pooped out of not actually
[3106.18 → 3116.10] poo, but poo can get on them um eggshell is a sheen it's a surface finish and the reason it's called eggshell
[3116.10 → 3123.22] is because it has a little bit of texture kind of like an egg, and it catches the light it has a little bit of shine
[3123.22 → 3130.42] like an egg and the reason that eggshell is good for walls is that it is a good balance between
[3130.42 → 3135.70] scattering the light that hits it which reduces like hot spots like shiny spots like you would see
[3135.70 → 3142.58] on a semi-gloss or a high gloss um and because of the bumpiness it hides surface imperfections
[3142.58 → 3150.82] and because of the slight um gloss to it is it has more it has more resin that sits on the surface so
[3150.82 → 3156.34] it's more likely that you're going to be able to scrub it without doing damage to either the finish
[3156.34 → 3163.70] because it's inherently kind of bumpy and uneven or to the wall or like the paint adhesion in total
[3163.70 → 3170.50] so that's why that's why eggshell is good for walls your eggshell paint can be in any tint or colour that
[3170.50 → 3177.14] you like so don't worry about don't sweat the colour go pick a colour put eggshell on your walls okay
[3177.14 → 3179.38] that's what you want to do new idea new pitch
[3182.18 → 3189.70] hear me out you call it a flamethrower, but it's mini, and you just use it to work with heat
[3189.70 → 3197.46] shrink tubing, and it's its just a lighter i kind of need one of those actually i kind of like it
[3198.10 → 3202.66] you know it's actually not that far off a product that I wanted to develop for LTT store
[3202.66 → 3209.70] I wanted to make uh, and it's its it's on it's on the list but I want to make a like a handheld
[3209.70 → 3217.38] torch for lighting candles, but that also has like a secondary trigger that just like is like a blower
[3217.38 → 3221.54] you can put it out yeah so it's like a lighter and blower and because I just want it next to my bath so
[3221.54 → 3227.22] when I light my scented candles for my bath because I'm a chick like that um he makes the candles himself
[3227.22 → 3232.02] i it they're actually pretty nice like I'm not even like I'm not throwing shade he does a pretty
[3232.02 → 3237.86] good job I'm kind of get I'm kind of an I'm learning to be an enthusiast yeah yeah and by the way one is
[3237.86 → 3243.70] candle tips hey guys can I just please make it very clear for the people to whom it was not already
[3243.70 → 3251.22] that when I'm like I'm a chick like that I am parodying i it's satire I'm making fun of toxic masculinity
[3251.22 → 3257.30] okay thank you carry on oh that was the pitch I think I was yeah yeah I like it yeah no that's
[3257.30 → 3263.54] it yeah like I like it just in the shape of a flamethrower yeah for sure I'm into it yeah max asks
[3263.54 → 3269.46] does buy a Ltd store gift card help lots cash flow or are there additional barriers we as viewers
[3269.46 → 3276.26] don't see seems like an alternative to pre-ordering since funds can be used towards any product max did you
[3276.26 → 3286.82] just spend a thousand dollars whoa what to buy one eggshell t-shirt and four two and four 250 gift
[3286.82 → 3298.98] cards so i actually don't know how it works one moment please holy crap I need to call nick light
[3298.98 → 3308.42] for a second I was like oh no merch message is glitched out uh nick you're on speaker on the wan show
[3309.14 → 3316.90] okay so I know that uh gift cards do not show up on my sale report in the Shopify dashboard
[3317.46 → 3322.66] does that mean Shopify holds the gift card money or do they send it to us
[3322.66 → 3333.46] uh I believe that they hold it until it's used okay so then if people just like buy a bunch of gift
[3333.46 → 3343.14] cards that does not help our cash flow no okay um use a bunch of gift cards to help our cash flow I see
[3343.14 → 3351.38] okay uh well I'm going to let max s here know that it was a perfect effort good thought um should tell him
[3351.38 → 3357.30] how much and yeah so uh poor max bought a thousand dollars in gift cards to try and help us out with
[3357.30 → 3367.14] screwdriver and backpack cash flow wow yeah um okay thanks nick okay, okay all right see you later
[3368.90 → 3370.90] oh okay um
[3370.90 → 3383.14] um, um uh right so max if you want to send a ticket to support we'd be happy to refund that for
[3383.14 → 3393.86] you um to hmm okay uh that's pretty beneficial for Shopify to hold on to the gift yeah that's actually
[3393.86 → 3402.02] kind of BS yeah wow like what happens if people never spend the gift card do they just keep keeping
[3402.02 → 3408.42] can keep it I don't know i kind of want to figure that out now that's kind of why don't we do a couple
[3408.42 → 3414.18] more before we uh before we do our sponsor spots Zachary asks what's the hardest choice you made when
[3414.18 → 3421.46] building LME leg the leg flow plane that you can tell us about the hardest choice
[3423.30 → 3434.34] jeez I can think of like a lot of very big yeah choices hardest choice I mean I think probably
[3434.34 → 3438.42] one of the hardest choices that I ever made was buying this building that's what i that's what i
[3438.42 → 3444.34] expected it was going to be was the first building that was such a leap I was I as far as I could tell
[3444.34 → 3450.34] I was going into debt for 10 years yeah um I literally remember that conversation spoiler alert
[3450.34 → 3460.50] we crushed it in like one and a half thanks guys but yeah i I remember sitting down and having a
[3460.50 → 3467.54] conversation where you were like oh I know we need this to grow but like I don't know about
[3467.54 → 3475.62] being under debt for a decade yeah over a building yeah yeah it worked out yeah what about
[3475.62 → 3483.54] you oh wow um I'm going with taking a job at a company that probably has no future whatsoever but
[3483.54 → 3488.74] you feel free and let me know if it's a different one yeah I know that's I mean that's that was it i
[3488.74 → 3496.90] like uh I was doing really well in school I had yeah I had recruiters on me already yeah taking this job
[3496.90 → 3500.18] was undercutting the amount that the recruiters wanted to pay me
[3502.18 → 3508.10] by like, and it was like way less stable and yeah by a lot as well but it just it seemed so much more
[3508.10 → 3512.82] interesting, and it was and I'm very happy that I did it but like I'm glad too and honestly
[3515.62 → 3520.74] I don't it I don't know if I can say it was that hard I think like telling my parents was harder than
[3520.74 → 3526.26] actually making the choice oh I remember your parents level of impress being extremely low
[3527.30 → 3533.62] now it's very high they're both super stoked yeah yeah Luke's parents, and we're good yeah
[3534.98 → 3539.30] but like I still I can't even say it on the show but I still remember what my dad said you probably
[3539.30 → 3546.18] remember what my dad said why don't you just say it on the show I'd have to bleep it uh okay I'll try
[3546.18 → 3551.30] and time it I'm I'm just I'm still going to say it short I'm just going to say the letter sure just in
[3551.30 → 3557.78] case um after like a little bit of silence being like okay just doesn't it up
[3560.10 → 3567.86] it's like all right your dad's so supportive yeah he's great yeah I mean for both of them like at
[3567.86 → 3573.62] that point in time they were helping me quite a bit financially yep um and like i was close to
[3574.18 → 3578.50] finishing school but I was leaving, and they had helped me financially for like a while at this
[3578.50 → 3584.34] point so I was effectively throwing away a pretty significant amount of their investment and calling
[3584.34 → 3590.98] them on the phone to be like yeah I'm gonna YOLO this YouTube thing dude so the fact that they weren't
[3590.98 → 3596.02] like more negative about it was really cool and then very quickly yeah like once they I guess
[3596.02 → 3600.18] understood more about it because for a long time it was just like this thing I did to help fund my
[3600.18 → 3605.22] schooling yeah, and now they're like oh wait what once it started becoming more of a thing they were
[3605.22 → 3612.02] very quickly on board um like my mom was full on board when we were still in the house right
[3612.02 → 3617.94] so like they were yeah they were I mean by then we like were hiring more people and we
[3617.94 → 3623.38] like actually had recurring revenue I mean okay so no that's not fair they were both on board before
[3623.38 → 3627.46] then as well I don't know if you remember but my brother and my mom helped us move that's true
[3627.46 → 3632.42] out of your garage to the yeah I remember that it didn't take them that long yeah Luke's parents are
[3632.42 → 3638.50] super cool his whole family is super cool yeah um I was once threatened by one of his relatives with a
[3638.50 → 3643.54] knife man have we told we've probably told that story we have told the story but even then super cool
[3643.54 → 3651.22] I'm over it there's a significant amount of land between those two people like man i still
[3651.22 → 3655.06] I don't remember the words you said because it's just kind of not the way my memory works but I still
[3655.06 → 3662.02] remember the tone of your voice when you felt like you just you really needed reassurance when you
[3662.02 → 3669.70] told me that you had told your parents that we were doing this yeah it was like you really needed to hear me
[3669.70 → 3676.90] say this is going to be okay yeah and at that time I didn't really know the answer because we hadn't
[3676.90 → 3683.86] locked down the ownership of the LTT channel from NCI yet yeah I remember having already committed
[3684.58 → 3690.42] and knowing you were down the hall because I like lived with you at this point updating your LinkedIn
[3690.42 → 3695.54] because you weren't sure if we were going to get the channel I'm like this is bad
[3695.54 → 3703.86] I don't know if I've ever talked about hey I did tell you though that wherever I went I would try to
[3703.86 → 3711.54] take you with me, I'm just like yeah I made it clear that like Luke was part of the package yeah you
[3711.54 → 3714.90] had my back you had my back I'm not saying you didn't have my back I'm just saying in that situation
[3714.90 → 3720.66] that was a very I'm sure you remember that was a very doom and gloom because I mean it I don't think
[3720.66 → 3725.94] either of us were that convinced we were going to get the channel well we certainly weren't sure yeah
[3726.90 → 3732.26] there was some there was some drama around me trying to poach another NCI employee that almost
[3732.26 → 3741.46] submarine the whole deal yeah submarine torpedoed jeez son of a submariner um some of you will get it
[3741.46 → 3748.18] yeah so I was actually creating this LinkedIn profile look at this picture it was the only somewhat
[3748.18 → 3752.90] professional looking picture of me that existed and the only reason it looked professional is
[3752.90 → 3761.54] because the cheesy slogan t-shirt that I'm wearing was cropped out I mean I literally put my high
[3761.54 → 3768.34] school on here because what am I going to say that I flunked out of UBC you know what's great you know
[3768.34 → 3777.54] there's that whole stereotype or that whole um that whole um I don't know trope right where uh startup
[3777.54 → 3787.54] founders uh like startup people quit school but I flunked out Luke quit like what a year from
[3787.54 → 3794.82] completion something like that okay ed was the worst because as far as I remember is he still here oh i
[3794.82 → 3801.78] wish he was still here in the office to tell the story it's terrible okay ed was like one half of a
[3801.78 → 3809.94] semester from completion he actually started working for us on like an uh like a school uh a school endorsed
[3810.58 → 3818.98] like a work study like program like for credits and then he literally as far as I can tell just
[3818.98 → 3821.78] never went back and stopped replying to emails
[3821.78 → 3830.10] I don't know why did you people have so much faith in me, I don't know did I look like I knew what I was doing
[3832.58 → 3837.54] a lot of the stories from that time like trying to recall them like this was the same with
[3837.54 → 3843.22] the mountain story like when I was talking about the lightning it doesn't feel real and then i I like
[3843.22 → 3847.86] pick up some evidence like after watching I told that story about the lightning I said it was really
[3847.86 → 3853.22] close yeah in my head I was like 30 feet is but then I'm like that doesn't sound real I can't say
[3853.22 → 3857.78] that and then I went back and I watched some of those old videos and there's Austin who was with
[3857.78 → 3862.82] me at the time talking about how close it was at that time because it's on film yeah I'm like oh my
[3862.82 → 3868.82] goodness my memory was actually correct that's insane another thing I want to bring this up now before
[3868.82 → 3874.26] I forget it yeah if you mentioned the old shirt that you had on for the LinkedIn profile yeah if you
[3874.26 → 3881.78] google LTT store on the sidebar it comes up with uh line of Sebastian Canadian YouTuber like your
[3881.78 → 3887.54] your like Wikipedia page yeah, and then it's just this picture of this ancient picture of you
[3887.54 → 3892.34] wearing your old badminton shirt like everyday badminton every day I'm shuttling yeah and then
[3892.34 → 3898.98] if you click images I don't know why I did this if you click images it's like almost all just
[3898.98 → 3907.86] like you wearing very little clothes like so many of the results are just partially, partially nude
[3907.86 → 3921.86] like by the way this is amazing oh man what is that oh that's funny that's actually hilarious oh no
[3921.86 → 3928.98] all right uh what are we supposed to be talking about right now I don't remember uh oh
[3928.98 → 3934.50] I'm really enjoying the show today I'm having a great time uh the store oh the show is brought to
[3934.50 → 3943.78] you by uh something OVH cloud hey let's let's do this uh ransomware and other cyberattacks are the

[4056.74 → 4060.50] essentially just like pitch all their products and I'm just like no we know all your stuff we
[4061.14 → 4066.34] whatever OVH like switched our point of contact person they emailed me they're like hey I'd like to

[4177.30 → 4183.14] there's your spelling all right what do you want to talk about next i I found that very interesting
[4183.14 → 4189.30] because we use literally every single one of those I know right that was one heck of a sponsor rack um
[4190.26 → 4196.58] it's like why do we even bother exchanging money yeah just like yeah let's just simplify this process
[4201.14 → 4208.34] uh let's talk about Honda because this yeah Honda um you guys can yourself yeah yeah yeah I mean you
[4208.34 → 4214.82] know I talk a lot about anti-consumer behaviour from tesla because tesla kind of is their own worst enemy
[4214.82 → 4219.54] when it comes to making headlines for being complete jackasses to their customers but that
[4219.54 → 4225.46] doesn't mean that I am any more tolerant of it when anybody else does it and this is not cool this was
[4225.46 → 4232.02] posted on the drive okay Honda orders big takedown of Honda related 3d printing models from maker
[4232.02 → 4239.86] communities we're not just talking things that for which there exists a Honda exact part or things with
[4239.86 → 4246.66] Honda logos on them or things with even Honda the word Honda as part of you know where you could make
[4246.66 → 4251.38] an argument that it's against their trademark you know in their font or whatever they took down
[4252.50 → 4259.78] everything from stuff anything that was compatible with a Honda and Honda can quite frankly eat a
[4259.78 → 4268.74] gigantic dick like that is not cool I really hope that like throughout all of these communities people are
[4268.74 → 4274.58] able to uh compile together all of these different files and just like throw them up somewhere and
[4274.58 → 4284.10] let people download them like because like that's this drives me nuts a lot of the parts were even just
[4284.10 → 4290.50] compatible there was no first party other solution so you're just taking all this work that people have
[4290.50 → 4304.26] done to make your product better yeah, and you're like why to what end so rough annoying too because
[4304.26 → 4309.70] that's the parent company of my car and I've been holding off getting a different car I shouldn't say
[4309.70 → 4314.74] new car because I have no real interest in buying a new car but I've been holding off uh updating my car
[4314.74 → 4321.46] car because I really like my car so I would want just like a newer more electrified version right but
[4321.46 → 4330.18] now uh I don't really want to support this so now no this is extremely anti-consumer behaviour
[4330.18 → 4337.06] there is no excuse I don't even care someone in flow plane chat mentioned Streisand effect
[4337.06 → 4342.50] yeah that's what I'm kind of saying is like i I hope people bring together all these files and keep
[4342.50 → 4347.86] pushing them in other ways uh that Honda's not as easily able to take down and I hope more people
[4347.86 → 4353.70] use them and more people either repair their cars or add features or do whatever um I'm going to stay angry
[4355.62 → 4365.46] why next topic yep what is it instion's gone so okay yeah what this is a huge problem in IOT now instion
[4365.46 → 4370.50] was not one of the biggest brands in the space by any stretch of the imagination, but they were a home
[4370.50 → 4377.22] automation uh brand that made hubs switches uh lights basically
[4379.78 → 4387.46] they are gone the system status still says online which I guess is hilarious, but they have essentially
[4388.10 → 4397.86] shut off their servers uh everyone's hubs are offline um and yes right here from simulate on Reddit
[4397.86 → 4403.14] this is the problem with having a single provider for the entire technology stack and this is why I was
[4403.14 → 4411.86] so angry about having any kind of cloud integration for anything in my home because you cannot guarantee
[4411.86 → 4420.42] to me that you will still be around in a year 10 years a hundred years homes do not just you don't
[4420.42 → 4427.14] replace them you upgrade them you upgrade them you repair them certainly, but you don't just replace them
[4427.14 → 4433.14] it's a very different mentality when you are buying something to integrate into your home
[4433.78 → 4441.94] versus when you are you know buying an essentially more of a consumable like a consumer electronic device
[4441.94 → 4449.22] or a couch things that actually do tend to be replaced every so often like I don't mind if a
[4449.22 → 4456.34] piece of cutting edge technology like a television um you know has some kind of uh change in its
[4456.34 → 4460.58] cert actually no that makes me pretty angry too because we had that whole situation around Nintendo
[4460.58 → 4466.66] closing the uh the Wii U shop as well as uh which was the other one they closed TVs inserting ads
[4466.66 → 4472.98] and like weird stuff like that inserting ads changing the experience yeah that sucks but killing
[4472.98 → 4478.10] the functionality after the fact this is why an entire generation of gaming experiences is not going
[4478.10 → 4488.42] to exist for the people that come after yeah and if it's just it's extremely frustrating yeah yeah the
[4488.42 → 4491.78] riff over on twitch says I got an error code on one of the controllers for my heated floors
[4491.78 → 4500.98] past service got an error that says replace the unit past serviceable age unreal so no everything
[4500.98 → 4506.18] needs to be locally controlled so that the worst case scenario is that you can keep running whatever
[4506.18 → 4516.58] software you had bugs and all that has to be the worst case scenario so rip inst eon I'm really frustrated
[4516.58 → 4522.98] that this is happening, but you know every I'm not the only one who called it this is what happens
[4522.98 → 4528.34] when every company creates proprietary crap that only works with their own proprietary crap
[4529.94 → 4536.98] speaking of which uh do you know how many times Brandon's model x has been back to tesla no like three
[4536.98 → 4541.78] and they wanted like 900 for some stupid thing he wants to do like a whole video about it just like the
[4541.78 → 4547.14] the joys of electric ownership like three years later how glad am I that I spent this much
[4547.14 → 4554.34] money on this car um because like man most uh service centres like won't touch them really in
[4554.34 → 4560.50] other anti-consumer news Tim Cook hates sideloading Tim Cook delivered the keynote speech at the global
[4560.50 → 4566.50] privacy summit in Washington DC and his he mostly highlighted apple's privacy features and their ongoing
[4566.50 → 4570.66] fight to protect privacy this is a quote as a company we're profoundly inspired by what technology can
[4570.66 → 4574.90] make possible, but we know to that the technology is neither inherently good nor inherently bad it is
[4574.90 → 4578.98] what we make of if it is a mirror that reflects the ambitions of the people who use it the people
[4578.98 → 4584.58] who build it and the people who regulate if it's good scriptwriters um or speech right I guess
[4584.58 → 4588.58] technically it's a speech not a script of a speech he also highlighted apple's features that
[4588.58 → 4592.90] give users control over their data like the app tracking transparency he is against proposed
[4592.90 → 4596.90] regulations that would diminish these features and expose users to privacy and security risks
[4596.90 → 4601.54] here in Washington and elsewhere said cook policymakers are taking steps in the name of competition
[4601.54 → 4606.02] that would force apple to let apps onto iPhone that circumvent the app store through a process called
[4606.02 → 4611.54] sideloading said cook this means data hungry companies would be able to avoid our privacy rules
[4611.54 → 4617.22] and once again track our users against their will it would also potentially give bad actors a way around
[4617.22 → 4623.22] the comprehensive security protections we have put in place putting them in direct contact with our users
[4623.22 → 4629.62] if we are forced to let unnetted apps onto iPhone the unintended consequences will be profound warned cook
[4629.62 → 4634.50] and when we see that we feel an obligation to speak up and ask policymakers to work with us to advance goals
[4634.50 → 4637.62] that I truly believe we share without undermining privacy in the process
[4639.06 → 4647.22] boy it definitely has nothing to do with how much money they make having a monopoly on software sold on their mobile platform
[4647.22 → 4653.78] yeah because there are other solutions here right oh absolutely treating it like this is the only possible solution
[4653.78 → 4660.02] to completely have no barriers whatsoever to malware on the iPhone do you imagine for a second
[4660.66 → 4667.54] that apple is going to just be like okay yeah well you know what let's go I'll take you three steps further
[4667.54 → 4674.10] we're going full root access to everything here we go boys like considering okay two things not only does the app
[4674.10 → 4678.18] store take a cut which is the main thing that people only ever talk about because honestly the other
[4678.18 → 4684.82] one is not that big of a deal yeah, but they also take a fee to be on the platform at all sure do um
[4685.62 → 4692.74] I would be much more okay with it if like is we had to handle the uh the uploading of the files
[4692.74 → 4698.98] to the users all this other type of stuff, and they just ensured that it was all privacy okay
[4698.98 → 4705.70] right and then maybe we have to list it on the app store or whatever but um we pay this fee it gets
[4705.70 → 4709.62] a privacy check mark from them, and then we have to handle everything certification process or something
[4709.62 → 4713.94] fine with that that's an easy workaround you don't want to do that though because your whole actual
[4713.94 → 4719.46] point is just to make sure you keep getting your cut and that it doesn't get extremely transparent dude
[4720.50 → 4724.42] man stop trying you've seen the whole thing where apple like claims they don't know how much they
[4724.42 → 4728.82] make on the app store oh yeah and Jaden just brought this up too you have to use a mac to develop for
[4728.82 → 4738.34] them like dude it's brutal oh, oh there's a there's a thing I'm supposed to there's a thing I'm supposed
[4738.34 → 4744.26] to uh show where's uh where is it there's another LTT store thing I forgot about I need your guy's I need
[4744.26 → 4751.30] your guys opinion ask the audience about the duvets Linus the duvets we are working on the bed ripper
[4751.30 → 4762.74] so it's actually inspired by um like green PCB green and CPU pin gold so if you look really
[4762.74 → 4768.42] closely we can't get in close enough it's shaped like the pads on the bottom of a LGA CPU here do
[4768.42 → 4774.02] you want to just look at mine sure there you go, and we've got a couple of different colourways this one
[4774.02 → 4782.58] is actually uh more like it's the same uh pin it's the same pin shape for this design it increases
[4782.58 → 4790.02] in size or decreases in size and density in order to uh get this kind of this pixel uh gradient-y
[4790.02 → 4797.30] kind of thing so we want to hear from you guys uh which ones do you like do you like the more CPU
[4797.30 → 4803.46] coloured one or would you prefer something that's a little more monochromatic and more likely to match
[4804.18 → 4810.58] um yes Jayden other this is how you get your other decor um yeah I don't know I would say straw
[4810.58 → 4817.06] pull it, but that didn't exactly work out that great yeah is there a better i why is straw pull crappy
[4817.06 → 4823.14] now I don't know I think twitch implemented their own polling thing and I think twitch was the main
[4824.10 → 4829.46] reason why people use straw polls, so maybe there's like something else now oh okay I don't know I'm
[4829.46 → 4833.70] you know what I'm going to give them one more try I'm going to give them one more chance and then if this
[4833.70 → 4839.38] sucks and doesn't work then we will just have to move on people are telling me to make my
[4839.38 → 4846.10] own straw poll we've been thinking about making a polling thing um but there's honestly just so much
[4847.14 → 4852.90] there we go sorry about that guys so I'm dumping that into the chat YouTube chat is moving
[4852.90 → 4857.14] pretty fast, but guys go ahead and take a crack at trying to click on one of these
[4858.90 → 4866.02] in the meantime uh why don't we jump into our oh, oh in the meantime we should definitely do some more
[4866.02 → 4873.38] merch messages uh there are not too many curated ones which is good, and it looks like Dan are you
[4873.38 → 4877.86] in are you in slightly better under control shape over there yeah I think it calmed down which is always
[4877.86 → 4883.54] nice okay do you want to read us a few yeah sure had a conversation with a bud a few times
[4883.54 → 4889.54] how do you feel about using Chinese smartphones from brands that send user data to China or have in
[4889.54 → 4899.54] the past uh blue the only uh one plus Hawaii uh that sort of huawei yeah do you care at all is it
[4899.54 → 4910.66] better than google um okay so i as a non-Chinese citizen and as someone who doesn't really have to go to
[4910.66 → 4918.10] china um to me sending my information to the Chinese government is frankly not really that
[4918.10 → 4922.50] different from sending my information to the American government I think the Chinese government
[4922.50 → 4929.22] has made it very clear that they can and will use citizens data against them uh there's some very
[4929.22 → 4938.02] alarming footage coming out of china right now um they're they're if their authoritarianism was not
[4938.02 → 4945.70] apparent before for some reason I think it's pretty clear now uh how they intend to use the information
[4945.70 → 4953.06] that they harvest from their citizens um but as a non-citizen i I don't really see what difference it
[4953.06 → 4959.14] makes if they know what apps I'm using on my phone or whatever the case may be so for me personally no
[4959.14 → 4966.82] I don't care I don't especially want to benefit the CCC uh the CCP in any way, but someone said CCCP
[4966.82 → 4971.86] you know the codec pack anyway uh I don't want to benefit them in any way but i
[4974.58 → 4979.54] I have other reasons for not using those brands of Chinese phones just generally speaking I find that
[4979.54 → 4985.06] their android skins like kind of suck, and they tend to be a china first experience preloaded with apps
[4985.06 → 4989.38] that I don't care about some of which aren't necessarily removable so that's where I'm at on
[4989.38 → 4996.74] that we have another update from max here who spent more money uh to tell you that there's no ticket
[4996.74 → 5002.74] needed because uh it's no difference buying now or later uh the first order was to funnel money to you
[5002.74 → 5005.54] thank you for answering his question thanks max
[5005.54 → 5016.10] okay hit me again um this one's from Andrew any plans for more streams with other leg team members
[5016.10 → 5021.78] uh Sarah's was pretty entertaining as for my friend mythos turkey bacon is better than regular bacon turkey
[5021.78 → 5028.58] bacon is amazing have you tried turkey bacon no oh it's so good plans for more streams Sarah's yeah Sarah's
[5028.58 → 5034.58] was great it's its something that I think we absolutely should and could do more of, but it's
[5034.58 → 5040.10] not something that's on our radar right now just because man are there ever a lot of balls in the
[5040.10 → 5045.70] air at the moment with the labs coming by the way uh we're pushing that another week I'm so sorry next
[5045.70 → 5052.58] week I promise for real okay so also we've been working with this uh startup company to do the call
[5052.58 → 5058.34] for this uh and they like walked me through how it should work and everything it's very it's an
[5058.34 → 5064.90] extremely streaming friendly calling service uh and it I think it's going to be great we'll have to
[5064.90 → 5069.86] try it for us to see uh but every single week they're like hey are we doing it this week we're all ready
[5070.66 → 5075.94] we're all ready to go we're excited to like to see it go live and then I'm just like uh no
[5077.14 → 5086.90] sorry guys next week we're working on it oh man okay it'll happen it'll happen uh do you want more
[5086.90 → 5092.26] yeah keep hitting me sure uh this one's from nick I live out in the woods in the southern us
[5092.26 → 5097.06] and my internet is less than three megabits per second on a good day there's no major ISPS in the
[5097.06 → 5105.54] area any way possibly to get decent internet speeds uh no hot spots either probably not no, no I mean Starlink
[5106.42 → 5112.10] like that's a good yeah that's that's about as good as it's going to get unfortunately also you mentioned
[5112.10 → 5120.34] woods, and you mentioned bacon uh if you go camping in bc, and you go past an indigenous ran gas station
[5120.34 → 5128.18] it's pretty common that they'll have bacon there it's like incredible every single time yeah wow
[5128.18 → 5132.82] I'm going to have to try it's actually amazingly good just a recommendation if you come by bc and
[5132.82 → 5138.42] you're going camping it's like you get a bag on the way there you get a bag on the way back it's great
[5138.42 → 5143.86] it's worth it both ways oh this one's uh this one's kind of exciting this for mat they Linus
[5143.86 → 5149.46] Luke and bell I'll have to let him know I work for ASML uh we supply sorry I keep getting messages
[5149.46 → 5155.06] here yes I know who ASML is hi you have my attention we supply lithography machines uh have
[5155.06 → 5160.02] you heard of Samsung or intel I've been chatting with bell about this already but I was curious to be
[5160.02 → 5167.46] interested in touring our factories I mean does a bear shit in the woods well there's bacon there
[5167.46 → 5173.78] apparently so um yeah I meant jerky I don't know why I said yes i and my audience would be quite
[5173.78 → 5181.86] interested in fact in seeing ASML's facilities drag him there personally yeah uh there's
[5181.86 → 5187.22] absolutely no way that I would that I would give up the opportunity to go check that out
[5187.22 → 5191.14] um all right
[5193.54 → 5198.58] oh shoot i accidentally moved a merch message that was thanking me for guiding them on
[5198.58 → 5205.54] their phenom 1055 t overclock hey no problem apparently that machine serves them for 10 years yeah
[5205.54 → 5210.58] absolutely love it all right they're coming in pretty uh pretty heavy now so Dan I'm going to let you
[5210.58 → 5215.22] deal with the incoming very much and I'll switch to going through the curated ones, and you're asked are you
[5215.22 → 5218.98] still happy with your security camera setup will you be having a similar setup in the new home yes
[5218.98 → 5224.74] I will have a similar setup it will all be not on the cloud thank you ubiquity for not having
[5224.74 → 5232.66] subscription fees or uh cloud access unless I authorize it um for any of my security stuff
[5233.30 → 5239.06] uh by the way we are hope we were hoping to have ubiquity come on and talk about that lawsuit against
[5239.06 → 5245.22] the blogger um it looks like for legal reasons that might be a bit of a challenge that makes sense
[5245.22 → 5250.82] so all we're going to have to do is like I said I love the products I love the mission uh i I am
[5250.82 → 5255.62] hoping for the best when that is all resolved I'm I'm hoping they come away clean I just don't like
[5255.62 → 5261.30] the optics right now yeah uh by the way before you do more of these there are a couple more topics that
[5261.30 → 5266.10] I feel like we should probably touch on are you getting through these because you have to go I do have to go okay
[5266.10 → 5272.50] got it IAN says I found out you ride as well how's the new backpack fit on the motorcycle good for
[5272.50 → 5279.22] my body type and for my bike I have a street bike Bram says hey Linus with three kids and running leg
[5279.22 → 5284.02] float plane creator warehouse how do you keep yourself mentally sane with the life you're living and giving
[5284.02 → 5287.62] it's everything you have done you think your lifestyle is sustainable thanks for all the videos in it
[5288.18 → 5292.26] there might have been more to this, but it got cut off um I have a lot of help guys like that's the
[5292.26 → 5296.74] thing it's like Luke runs float plane I don't know I don't want to float plane nick runs creator warehouse
[5296.74 → 5302.18] I don't want to create a warehouse yeah right like what about leg like we've got we've got Yvonne
[5302.18 → 5308.66] and Colton we've got jams we've got uh just we've got ed we've got all these people who are
[5308.66 → 5314.58] running these departments um if anything I actually think the team has really stepped up in a big way in
[5314.58 → 5320.26] the last six months to make my life way more manageable I mean there's always going to be crazy days
[5320.26 → 5326.74] we did a collab with call me Chris yesterday where I was there are 400 minutes of footage
[5327.46 → 5334.34] and I was in front of the camera for probably 11 hours it's a challenging day for sure like it's not
[5334.34 → 5342.66] like I'm you know not still going for it but guys I have a ton of support, and you know I have
[5342.66 → 5349.62] to give myself um and Yvonne credit for building a team to support us for having the foresight to do that
[5350.10 → 5356.58] but that doesn't take anything away from the actual efforts of the people actually doing it uh this is
[5356.58 → 5364.18] not it's not just me and yeah i i think that what I'm doing is sustainable for some time I'm
[5364.18 → 5370.10] excited I'm actually really pumped right now uh screwdriver backpack some of the other products that we have
[5370.10 → 5377.70] coming labs um we know I think I read a comment on float plane that really it hit me so hard that i
[5377.70 → 5385.78] I blasted it out to the entire company uh calling what we've been doing lately the golden age of LTT
[5386.34 → 5394.18] and considering how many times I've seen our community claim that we are in the golden age i honestly I'm
[5394.18 → 5401.62] energized I'm starting to feel like the golden age never ends golden decade like why stop here
[5401.62 → 5405.70] yeah why don't we just make it more golden yeah bring on the Xbox controllers
[5405.70 → 5413.54] that might not have been golden age yeah yeah I'm ready boys
[5415.78 → 5420.02] uh anonymous says what part of the tech space really needs more competition to create better products
[5420.02 → 5428.58] and more innovation man CPU GPU looking pretty good right now what else we got I feel like I've had
[5428.58 → 5435.54] this thought printers I like it yeah sure okay I feel like I've had this thought recently but I can't
[5435.54 → 5440.26] remember what man there's so much competition even like streaming gear now like
[5442.10 → 5447.38] I mean I'd say that I'd say that the Linux community is underserved still in a big way but I'm
[5447.38 → 5450.10] expecting that to change with steam deck taking off the way that it is
[5452.58 → 5455.54] man where do we what really needs to improve
[5457.54 → 5465.54] oh I swear I had the thought of like so-and-so is using this thing because it is the only option i
[5465.54 → 5469.62] feel like I had that thought in the last like week but I can't remember what it was VR headsets is one
[5469.62 → 5474.98] from your headsets definitely just to be completely honest yeah e-ink display stuff says laddie okay yeah
[5474.98 → 5480.74] yeah i think the VR headsets thing though I think we're still not completely not crap tablets
[5480.74 → 5485.22] yeah it's hard for there to be any more competition Amazon is so dominant in the cheap tablet space
[5487.30 → 5490.98] yeah monitors there are a lot of great monitors out there you know I feel like monitors are doing
[5490.98 → 5497.70] pretty good yeah there's a lot of innovation in monitors right now man cutie ole duh Zachary
