[0.00 → 9.98] How are you all doing this week? Welcome to the WAN Show. We've got a fantastic show lined up for you.
[9.98 → 18.02] The big news in tech this week is obviously the socialpocalypse. That's right.
[19.04 → 26.24] We've got the verification topic. We're talking about Twitter. We're talking about, what was the other one?
[26.24 → 34.32] Tumblr's verification checkmarks. We've got brand's verification checkmarks. We'll be chatting a little bit about that.
[34.32 → 48.64] In other news, there were some various NVIDIA shenanigans. The X4080 12GB is back as a 4070 Ti, but it's still going to hurt your wallet, which is pretty hilarious.
[48.64 → 55.44] Logitech has confirmed that they are sending me a sample of the G Cloud.
[56.16 → 66.26] This is a review sample. We'll be talking about my thoughts about the G Cloud. I'm pretty excited to get hands-on with it.
[66.26 → 73.62] And, in what I'd say is probably the biggest news of the week, Ash Ketchum finally did it.
[74.66 → 82.88] Finally, the best official, officially the best Pokémon trainer. I'm sure Luke's going to have a lot of thoughts about that.
[82.96 → 88.10] At least I hope he does, because I never even watched the original show, so I have no idea what's going on.
[88.10 → 89.04] Oh, also...
[89.04 → 90.44] What does that even mean?
[92.38 → 94.42] I shouldn't laugh that loud in the airplay.
[95.06 → 101.52] Also, Luke's here with me, you know? So, yeah, you can tell it's going to be a really great show, because he's definitely...
[101.52 → 104.30] You can see he's verified. Verified here.
[104.38 → 104.50] Yeah.
[104.50 → 105.60] All right, let's roll that intro.
[106.52 → 107.32] First time ever.
[110.26 → 112.06] Let's try to figure out why there's coffee here.
[112.06 → 134.36] The show's brought to you by Zoho One, Squarespace, and something else I missed there.
[134.56 → 135.64] One second.
[136.06 → 137.08] And brilliant.
[137.66 → 140.60] All right, let's jump right into our big topic of the week.
[140.60 → 145.40] Okay, Luke, you've been travelling, obviously, because you're clearly not here.
[146.22 → 146.70] So...
[146.70 → 146.98] Yes.
[147.92 → 151.82] Well, have you been keeping up with what's been going on in the social apocalypse?
[151.98 → 162.60] I thought, after the first week of Elon owning Twitter, that the days of hot and heavy, fast and loose updates coming was going to be...
[163.16 → 164.82] We're going to be kind of over.
[165.18 → 168.58] But if anything, it feels like the chaos has accelerated.
[168.58 → 170.28] Have you been paying attention to this?
[171.60 → 176.90] I've been checking in at least once or twice a day, just to scroll for a few seconds.
[177.12 → 180.44] And it is brilliant and beautiful chaos, in my opinion.
[180.70 → 185.80] I said before this was happening that I was happy that it was happening, because it's not like he could make it any worse.
[186.40 → 188.86] And if anything, he's definitely made it more entertaining.
[188.86 → 198.92] And in his own words, I don't know if this is necessarily 100% true or not, but in his own words, there are more users on Twitter right now than there ever has been, or more activity at the very least.
[199.34 → 201.38] So, I mean, to a certain degree, it's working.
[201.68 → 204.94] Maybe all the advertisers are leaving, but there's a lot of people.
[204.94 → 205.94] Yeah, there's...
[205.94 → 206.56] Yeah, there's...
[206.56 → 207.20] I mean, I...
[207.20 → 209.74] I honestly, I haven't been able to look away from the train wreck.
[209.78 → 212.24] And you know what the really mind-boggling thing to me is?
[212.32 → 214.08] Is that one of...
[214.08 → 224.12] As one of the chief trolls on Twitter, never mind chief twit, the fact that he couldn't see this coming from a thousand miles away.
[224.12 → 229.08] Like, man, have you checked out some of the amazing impersonator accounts?
[230.38 → 230.86] Oh, yeah.
[231.08 → 233.14] There's been some pretty epic ones.
[233.40 → 233.94] The, um...
[233.94 → 235.18] Whatever that pharmacy was.
[235.40 → 237.12] Eli Lilly and Co.
[237.86 → 238.16] Okay?
[238.32 → 238.58] Yeah.
[238.80 → 239.18] Wow.
[239.40 → 242.90] Fake verified Twitter account for Eli Lilly and Co.
[243.14 → 246.92] Tweeted, and this is the most amazing part, tweeted,
[247.28 → 253.06] Insulin is now free, after which their stock actually plummeted.
[253.06 → 255.60] Is that amazing or what?
[255.92 → 259.38] Their stock went from $3.68 down to $3.46.
[259.90 → 261.02] And this isn't like...
[261.02 → 261.38] Whoa.
[261.50 → 263.58] This isn't a stock that was going down.
[263.84 → 267.58] This is a stock that's been going up for the last month.
[267.82 → 270.94] Actually has trended up overall for the last six months.
[271.12 → 274.06] And experienced a significant daily dip.
[274.14 → 276.44] Now, I do expect it to recover.
[277.18 → 280.60] Eli Lilly and Co. has since apologized for the misunderstanding.
[280.60 → 287.46] They say that they're sorry that you thought they said that.
[287.92 → 291.62] They're not sorry for gouging on the price of insulin.
[292.00 → 292.50] No, no, no.
[292.56 → 293.88] They're not sorry about that at all.
[294.18 → 299.02] But they're sorry that anyone thought that they would stop doing that.
[299.02 → 305.48] It's the most awful, non-apology apology that I think I have ever seen.
[306.56 → 309.54] Very fitting for a pharmaceutical gouging company, though.
[309.68 → 310.62] Totally makes sense.
[310.82 → 311.28] Absolutely.
[311.62 → 312.10] Absolutely.
[312.56 → 317.32] It is amazing to me what pharmaceutical companies get away with in the States.
[317.46 → 322.00] In the conversation under that tweet, I saw a lot of people talking about the price of insulin,
[322.10 → 323.80] which they absolutely should.
[323.80 → 329.82] And one of the most common defences for the price of insulin is that it doesn't matter because your insurance pays for it.
[330.16 → 332.42] And it's like, no.
[333.96 → 336.28] Insurance does not pay for anything.
[337.26 → 339.26] You pay for insurance.
[339.84 → 342.88] And then the money passes through your insurance.
[344.22 → 346.10] That's how insurance works.
[346.10 → 349.54] If insulin costs more, you'll pay more for insurance.
[349.96 → 355.90] And if your employer pays for your insurance, that's money that could have gone to you.
[357.34 → 357.90] Right?
[358.68 → 359.66] Come on, people!
[359.92 → 360.26] 100%.
[360.26 → 361.94] Come on, people!
[363.70 → 366.84] That's still money leaving your sphere of influence.
[366.84 → 373.26] Whether it was going to be 100% exactly directly deposited into your bank account or not is not 100% relevant.
[373.40 → 375.80] Your boss might have ended up just keeping it.
[376.10 → 376.30] Right?
[377.04 → 378.58] But there's a chance.
[378.90 → 379.10] Okay?
[379.34 → 382.84] There's a chance that some of it might have made its way to you.
[383.20 → 391.42] Once it leaves your company's coffers and goes to some pharmaceutical company, that chance goes to zero.
[391.86 → 393.94] There is zero chance that it makes it to you.
[394.04 → 397.06] This is just like, how does money work?
[397.34 → 398.10] Basics here.
[398.38 → 400.40] And I'm sure that I'm preaching to the choir.
[400.52 → 405.94] I know our audience is pretty clever and understands fundamentally how insurance works.
[406.10 → 413.42] At the end of the day, no insurance company will stay solvent if dollars out is greater than dollars in.
[413.70 → 413.98] Right?
[413.98 → 420.00] So you have to charge at least as much as you end up paying out.
[420.40 → 421.52] That's how it works.
[421.88 → 430.46] I mean, and that's another hilarious one to me is, you know, people will go, but, you know, I don't want to pay for someone else's medicine.
[430.46 → 431.46] That's socialism.
[431.78 → 437.74] But that's what insurance basically is, is everyone pays into this pool, and then the people that need it get paid out.
[437.74 → 445.08] And the greater those payout prices are, the fewer people they can afford to treat and the more rejected claims.
[445.26 → 456.34] Like, the whole thing is like, you know, you're kind of all on the same team until the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies collude to get the pricing as high as possible.
[456.34 → 458.34] So that, well, it's not even a conclusion.
[458.46 → 468.68] I'm sure the insurance companies would rather pay less, but there's the whole thing where you can't, where the negotiation abilities of these companies is limited in the U.S.
[468.68 → 469.56] It's wild.
[469.70 → 471.12] It's wild what's going on down there.
[471.18 → 473.86] And to be clear, we have tons of problems.
[474.32 → 476.20] Tons of problems in Canadian healthcare.
[476.20 → 477.92] Like, lots of problems.
[479.24 → 483.94] But our insulin is, like, cheap, which is good, I guess.
[485.04 → 486.64] We have that benefit, at least.
[486.88 → 487.94] Yeah, man.
[488.24 → 503.64] The fact that you can, I mean, just with the midterm elections going on down there right now, the fact that anyone can get elected without a platform that includes, like, just putting big pharma in its place is mind-blowing to me.
[503.64 → 507.16] Like, that's not the number one issue.
[508.34 → 521.80] Regardless of, like, reforming their Medicare system or whatever, like, even if they kept their system entirely the same, just stepping on pharmaceutical companies a little bit in general, I think makes a ton of sense.
[522.56 → 523.32] I don't know, man.
[523.32 → 534.76] Some of the you look at U.S. developed drugs in the U.S. and they're, like, 20 times the price as that same drug from that same company.
[534.92 → 536.84] Literally five minutes across the border.
[537.90 → 538.14] Yeah.
[538.20 → 543.56] Like, literally, you could walk, in some cases, to somewhere where it costs a fraction as much.
[543.56 → 553.88] If I was an American in America, I would be pissed that I was subsidizing the drug costs for other, like, rich nations, basically.
[554.06 → 555.04] Like, that would be annoying.
[555.44 → 555.66] Why?
[555.74 → 556.92] Why do we have to do that?
[557.22 → 562.86] I would be angry about that and wanting that to change, completely regardless of any other healthcare reform stuff.
[563.02 → 565.72] Just, like, the pharmaceutical stuff is crazy.
[565.96 → 566.26] That's all.
[566.48 → 571.84] But anyway, what was your favourite thing that happened on Twitter since Elon's takeover?
[571.84 → 572.56] Because I know mine.
[572.74 → 573.32] Let's go ahead.
[573.44 → 575.78] Let's just do kind of a week in review here.
[575.90 → 577.50] So, this week on Elon's Twitter.
[577.98 → 579.88] $8 Twitter blue launched.
[580.20 → 582.20] You've got to give credit where credit's due, okay?
[582.62 → 587.66] Elon said that they were going to launch this paid verification program, like, extremely quickly.
[587.78 → 595.40] This is probably faster than Twitter has ever gone from conceptualizing a new product to launching it, right?
[595.86 → 597.48] So, credit where it's due.
[597.76 → 600.28] They got this program launched extremely quickly.
[600.28 → 602.94] So, for $8, you could buy a checkmark.
[603.44 → 609.20] And that checkmark would identify your account as, like, blue verified.
[609.44 → 611.06] So, it was part of the Twitter blue program.
[611.58 → 616.16] And then clicking on it would also identify if it was, like, a legacy verified account.
[616.16 → 637.36] Then they launched a second gray official checkmark under accounts that had legacy verification to differentiate actual, you know, verified accounts that were at risk of being impersonated with just people who paid for a blue picture next to their name.
[637.36 → 641.30] Tumblr launched their own $8 blue checkmarks.
[641.68 → 646.48] You can apparently buy up to 24 of them, which is pretty neat.
[648.16 → 651.68] Just thought we'd throw that in there.
[651.82 → 654.52] So, Tumblr managed to get in the news about this.
[654.90 → 656.68] Well, why anything, Luke?
[656.68 → 659.98] Why can you buy 24 of them?
[660.28 → 661.84] Because then you're more verified.
[661.84 → 662.58] You can, like, gift them?
[662.70 → 663.82] Like, what, are you an idiot?
[664.20 → 666.92] No, you could just stack up to 24 of them in your username.
[668.34 → 674.72] Then, within hours, Elon killed the official checkmark.
[674.72 → 681.78] He also tweeted, far too many corrupt legacy blue verification checkmarks exist.
[682.00 → 685.86] So, no choice but to remove legacy blue in coming months.
[686.50 → 688.74] No idea what that means.
[690.90 → 693.44] And on Thursday, this is great.
[693.78 → 701.56] I actually was reading an article whose premise was Elon's Twitter might not be that screwed.
[701.56 → 707.24] Trimming the headcount reduces the operating cost and the users are up.
[707.92 → 718.88] And he's got this core of, like, right-handed people who are going to be able to help execute in this area and this area and this area.
[719.18 → 724.04] And in the time between, I guess, them writing that article and me reading it,
[724.44 → 731.16] two of the top executives that were supposedly going to be helping Elon steady the ship,
[731.16 → 735.92] I think one of them was in charge of advertising sales, and then one of them was, I'm sorry.
[735.92 → 736.74] Trust and safety.
[736.84 → 737.50] Trust and safety.
[737.56 → 737.98] That's right.
[737.98 → 738.36] Trust and safety.
[738.50 → 740.06] Head of trust and safety.
[741.62 → 742.18] Left.
[744.06 → 745.04] Oh, man.
[746.96 → 749.88] Twitter employees were told that remote work is ending.
[750.40 → 755.08] If you can physically make it to an office, and you don't show up, resignation accepted.
[755.08 → 758.48] That was apparently the message.
[759.16 → 765.26] And in an internal memo, Elon didn't quite directly say that the company might go bankrupt?
[765.60 → 768.58] Or was this in the internal memo?
[769.12 → 770.28] I can't remember.
[771.28 → 772.20] Where is it?
[772.32 → 773.12] Blah, blah, blah.
[773.54 → 774.00] No, I don't know.
[774.06 → 776.60] He sent out a memo that basically said as much, though.
[778.04 → 778.90] Oh, man.
[778.98 → 780.46] That is wild.
[780.46 → 785.60] Also said he wants to turn it into a bank with high-yield money market accounts.
[785.90 → 790.34] I have no idea whatsoever what that even means.
[790.76 → 791.52] Friday morning.
[791.68 → 792.66] So this is this morning.
[793.16 → 793.38] All right.
[793.46 → 798.96] So this is less than a week after Twitter Blue launched.
[798.96 → 811.34] They suspended the launch of Blue, brought the official checkmark back, but only for certain brands, leading to Twitter support's two most recent tweets being completely contradictory.
[813.22 → 814.28] Oh, man.
[815.24 → 816.38] So here you go.
[816.52 → 817.24] Yeah, here it is.
[817.60 → 818.02] Official.
[818.02 → 823.92] We are not currently putting an official label on accounts, but we are aggressively going after impersonation and deception.
[824.76 → 828.12] To combat impersonation, we've added an official label to some accounts.
[828.96 → 831.80] So which one is it?
[832.70 → 842.90] I saw a really hilarious tweet from someone putting Twitter Blue's official verification checkmark with the appropriate company.
[842.90 → 848.20] So it had a head of lettuce on there, like little bar graphs for how long these things lasted.
[848.34 → 850.00] So it had a head of lettuce at three days.
[850.58 → 852.74] It had Anthony Carducci.
[852.92 → 854.16] Do you remember that guy?
[854.90 → 855.34] Yeah.
[855.78 → 856.96] Had him on there.
[856.96 → 860.88] I forget her name, but had Britain's last Liz Truss.
[861.34 → 865.00] Britain's very shortest, shortest lasting PM ever.
[868.26 → 869.56] Oh, man.
[869.56 → 880.54] So yeah, it was head of trust and safety, CIO, so chief privacy officer, chief ISO, information security officer.
[880.60 → 882.48] I can't remember what CIO stands for.
[883.18 → 884.34] Yeah, Infosec, yeah.
[884.46 → 887.72] And chief compliance officer all resigned.
[888.02 → 893.70] I mean, man, this is a complete cluster.
[893.70 → 896.60] Okay, Luke, what was your favourite part of the week?
[896.70 → 897.10] Hit me.
[897.92 → 904.86] My favourite part was when everyone that I saw on the platform was impersonating Elon all at the same time.
[905.14 → 906.58] Did you see that?
[906.92 → 907.28] Yeah.
[907.28 → 909.42] That was actually amazing.
[909.42 → 919.58] I opened Twitter and I thought it was glitched because as I scrolled through, literally every single account in my news feed, whatever, was Elon Musk with his picture.
[919.94 → 925.42] And I had to scroll like a few times to get to someone that wasn't impersonating Elon.
[925.42 → 933.50] And I was like, that's actually, that's some like epic everyone coming together on the internet stuff that you just, you don't see all the time, you know?
[934.14 → 934.74] That was fun.
[935.50 → 938.06] I thought about joining some trend.
[938.22 → 943.58] A few of them seemed enticing, but then I realized I would have to actually tweet to do that.
[943.68 → 945.18] So I kind of decided not to.
[945.58 → 947.28] Yeah, Luke doesn't tweet anyway, so.
[948.20 → 950.54] I hate Twitter so much.
[950.54 → 961.12] It's interesting though, because like, I think he knew.
[961.46 → 963.90] I have a weird theory that I think he knew.
[964.70 → 966.48] Are you going 4D chess on this?
[967.40 → 968.36] I think so, yeah.
[968.48 → 968.74] Okay.
[968.74 → 973.24] I think he's 100% intentionally trying to stir the pot as much as possible.
[974.00 → 977.90] Because he's trying to do the web thing, right?
[977.92 → 980.42] He's trying to blow up the user base as much as possible.
[980.90 → 984.80] And the usage on the platform, he's probably not lying.
[984.90 → 986.66] It is probably higher than it has ever been.
[987.86 → 989.92] And him saying like, Twitter might go bankrupt.
[990.40 → 994.20] A lot of people are posing this as a new situation.
[994.82 → 995.00] Yeah.
[996.08 → 999.34] Twitter has been almost bankrupt a ton of times.
[999.34 → 1003.86] Twitter loses absurd amounts of money.
[1004.48 → 1006.36] This is not a profitable platform.
[1006.68 → 1008.22] It's a terrible website.
[1008.22 → 1012.06] It was really poorly ran.
[1012.16 → 1015.06] That was actually well documented, like, before Elon took over.
[1015.28 → 1015.40] Yes.
[1015.46 → 1018.34] This axing of employees, not in this way.
[1018.80 → 1024.90] Yeah, this was not the cleverest, smartest big brain.
[1024.90 → 1029.04] It was by lines of code because the whole thing was kind of whack.
[1029.26 → 1032.42] But they probably need to lose a bunch of employees.
[1033.28 → 1036.06] They probably needed to change a lot of things that they were doing.
[1036.26 → 1038.06] And bankruptcy was absolutely on the table.
[1038.12 → 1039.38] And it was on the table for years.
[1039.38 → 1041.70] So, like, that's not a new thing.
[1041.80 → 1045.32] It's not suddenly potentially going to go bankrupt because Elon showed up.
[1045.56 → 1047.02] Yes, a bunch of advertisers pulled out.
[1047.22 → 1049.74] But they weren't profitable with the advertisers anyway.
[1049.74 → 1056.02] I mean, there is a big difference between a little bit unprofitable and very unprofitable, though.
[1057.16 → 1057.46] Okay.
[1057.76 → 1058.00] Okay.
[1058.10 → 1060.42] Like, advertising is 90% of their revenue.
[1060.96 → 1065.40] Extremely, insanely unprofitable to the world is ending unprofitable.
[1065.50 → 1068.70] They were already losing, like, millions and millions of dollars.
[1068.82 → 1070.58] One year, they lost $2 billion, didn't they?
[1070.58 → 1074.38] Like, this was an excessively not profitable company.
[1074.70 → 1075.68] And, yes, it got worse.
[1075.94 → 1078.52] But, like, it's already in the volcano.
[1078.92 → 1080.90] And he just, like, shoved it way further down.
[1081.78 → 1084.58] Like, it's...
[1084.58 → 1087.92] I'm astonished that Twitter is still around.
[1088.12 → 1092.88] I thought years ago Twitter would just be gone because it's just a garbage platform.
[1093.34 → 1093.82] And what was that?
[1093.90 → 1094.58] I think the...
[1094.58 → 1099.12] Was it the 2016 elections completely saved the platform?
[1099.12 → 1103.90] Like, if that crazy ball of chaos didn't happen, Twitter would have died.
[1105.08 → 1115.16] And there's a bunch of conspiracy stuff talking about how Twitter is a big part of the reason why that election turned into the crazy ball of chaos that it was.
[1115.58 → 1118.06] And Twitter noticed that that was saving them.
[1118.48 → 1120.38] So they kind of helped edge it along.
[1120.76 → 1122.48] Which, I don't know how true that is or not.
[1122.64 → 1123.92] I've just seen some stuff about it.
[1123.98 → 1124.94] I wouldn't be surprised.
[1127.34 → 1128.02] I don't know.
[1128.02 → 1129.12] The whole thing's a mess.
[1129.48 → 1131.08] It's been a terrible garbage fire.
[1131.42 → 1134.58] People are acting like it is suddenly now a terrible garbage fire.
[1134.80 → 1135.76] The fire might be bigger.
[1136.04 → 1137.54] The pile of garbage might be bigger.
[1137.80 → 1139.92] But it's been a terrible garbage fire the whole time.
[1140.44 → 1141.24] So, okay.
[1141.32 → 1142.02] Hold on a second.
[1143.30 → 1152.00] Another possible favourite moment this week was when Elon sold another $4 billion of Tesla stock after saying he wasn't going to do that.
[1152.00 → 1154.24] Oh, did he?
[1154.86 → 1155.40] That's another.
[1155.40 → 1156.66] I didn't see that.
[1156.88 → 1158.12] That was another pretty good one.
[1159.92 → 1160.74] Oh, boy.
[1160.86 → 1161.06] Yeah.
[1161.34 → 1161.68] Yeah.
[1161.74 → 1164.16] Tesla stock has not been a good time.
[1164.50 → 1171.90] Now, I think there was a little bounce based on the inflation consumer index or whatever.
[1171.90 → 1173.22] I haven't actually paid attention.
[1173.42 → 1176.96] Tech in general had a pretty bouncy day yesterday.
[1176.96 → 1183.66] But Tesla has been on a not good run for the last little bit here.
[1183.74 → 1185.24] Along with a lot of tech.
[1185.24 → 1200.46] But it's really not helping that there are investors expressing concern that Elon is spending all of his timed inking around with this money fire over at Twitter and not spending time building cars that people actually want to drive and stuff.
[1202.04 → 1202.42] Yeah.
[1203.42 → 1204.44] I mean, that's probably fair.
[1204.54 → 1208.28] He's the CEO of, like, way too many companies.
[1209.84 → 1213.38] I know he does his whole, like, I work super hard.
[1213.38 → 1215.84] I sleep at the factory thing.
[1216.18 → 1221.20] But at a certain point, you're spending, like, one day a week maximum at each company, even if you are sleeping there.
[1221.42 → 1223.24] So, like, yeah.
[1223.48 → 1223.82] I don't know.
[1224.00 → 1225.50] Maybe just only sleeping there.
[1226.32 → 1227.04] All right.
[1227.54 → 1230.02] So, I think we can move on from Twitter.
[1230.58 → 1237.20] Why don't we talk about the general techpocalypse that's going on that's not just at Twitter.
[1237.76 → 1241.88] This week at Meta, 11,000 people were laid off.
[1241.88 → 1246.70] That was on Wednesday, which is 13% of the company's workforce.
[1248.00 → 1256.64] Zuckerberg apologized to staff for somehow thinking that the massive surge in online commerce driven by COVID would not return to prior trends.
[1256.64 → 1265.60] But insiders told Wired that the layoffs were also compensating for many failed projects from the last five to ten years.
[1266.04 → 1271.28] Their Libra crypto thing, their Lasso TikTok clone, Portal.
[1271.50 → 1272.18] Remember Portal?
[1272.18 → 1282.92] I'm happy to say that we got some of that Facebook stupid money fire money from them before that whole thing just turned into nothing.
[1283.04 → 1284.40] They're, like, video calling appliance.
[1284.48 → 1285.06] Remember that thing?
[1286.10 → 1286.40] Yeah.
[1286.74 → 1287.54] Vaguely, yeah.
[1287.68 → 1291.36] Instagram, Facebook shopping plans, their podcast plans.
[1291.46 → 1295.52] Hey, I got some of that money, too.
[1295.52 → 1297.02] So that was pretty cool.
[1297.24 → 1298.54] Thanks, Meta.
[1299.28 → 1301.38] The Meta Watch and more.
[1302.16 → 1312.76] Many analysts and investors are questioning a future in which Meta goes all in on the metaverse instead of putting more resources into things that have a clearer path to profitability.
[1312.76 → 1316.86] I would question that a little bit.
[1317.26 → 1319.12] I'm going to throw some controversy in there.
[1319.12 → 1319.40] Sure.
[1319.52 → 1319.84] Hit me.
[1319.94 → 1320.16] Yeah.
[1321.04 → 1326.26] I don't know that VR is necessarily it, but I don't know what else could be it.
[1326.26 → 1337.66] And I think Facebook is, or Meta, is understanding that their current platforms are kind of across the board becoming trendy and dying.
[1338.80 → 1340.50] Well, difficult to defend.
[1340.50 → 1341.14] They're not the thing anymore.
[1341.14 → 1342.96] Well, it's not so much that.
[1343.20 → 1344.38] It is that.
[1344.80 → 1348.60] But the main thing is that, you know, okay, you're always talking to me about this.
[1348.78 → 1355.82] What's the rule for how much easier something becomes in development or whatever amount of time?
[1355.88 → 1356.84] What were you talking about there?
[1357.52 → 1361.32] I hope I'm not misquoting it, but this is how I've been saying it for a while.
[1361.64 → 1364.80] It's every three years, everything gets three times easier.
[1365.02 → 1365.30] Okay.
[1365.38 → 1367.50] And you can't boil that down.
[1367.60 → 1369.54] It has to be at least three years, whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[1369.76 → 1369.90] Yeah.
[1369.90 → 1370.42] Yeah.
[1370.52 → 1379.38] So basically what it seems to me is that Meta is understanding that the moat around their product is getting thinner.
[1380.02 → 1380.12] Yeah.
[1380.32 → 1381.52] So you can't differ.
[1381.68 → 1392.90] Like you can't just say, oh, yeah, we figured out scalability of something like a feed that you can scroll through images or videos or whatever else.
[1393.28 → 1394.64] Someone else can build that now.
[1394.64 → 1397.60] Yeah, there's open source projects for it at this point.
[1397.66 → 1398.02] Exactly.
[1398.20 → 1401.70] So the only thing that differentiates them is the user base.
[1401.86 → 1405.20] And the only thing that keeps a user base somewhere is trendiness.
[1405.20 → 1411.22] And this trendiness, it feels like comes and goes faster than ever.
[1411.32 → 1414.68] Like the rise of TikTok still blows my mind.
[1414.88 → 1420.78] How fast TikTok went from absolutely nothing to absolutely everywhere.
[1421.90 → 1422.78] Wild, right?
[1422.78 → 1427.28] So, yeah, I think you're absolutely right is they have to figure out something.
[1427.76 → 1428.24] And you know what?
[1428.28 → 1429.22] I got to be honest.
[1430.32 → 1433.16] What is...
[1433.16 → 1435.04] What else is there?
[1435.04 → 1444.82] So, yeah, AR, VR, XR, whatever you want to call it might not be it.
[1445.20 → 1454.80] But what is your next frontier of technical innovation that is going to create a huge moat around you that keeps your competitors out?
[1456.08 → 1457.78] Yeah, so I'm back.
[1457.86 → 1458.70] Hopefully this is working.
[1458.98 → 1460.68] But, yeah, that was effectively my point.
[1461.10 → 1463.16] And he could be right.
[1463.16 → 1466.88] He might just be currently far from the goal.
[1467.30 → 1469.04] I don't know that he's right.
[1469.96 → 1471.74] But they need something, right?
[1471.78 → 1478.60] And they're seeing Apple just consistently have wins because they're owning the hardware space.
[1479.44 → 1483.18] They're finding ways to make sure that they keep on getting more market share.
[1483.60 → 1486.80] And because they own the device, they can do things like that.
[1486.80 → 1488.62] We're going to make it so that every...
[1488.62 → 1494.50] Like when people install and open Facebook, it asks them if they want the advertising tracking or whatever.
[1494.94 → 1496.76] And that just completely screws Facebook over.
[1497.34 → 1499.78] Apple is able to control that because they own the platform.
[1500.56 → 1500.80] I think...
[1501.40 → 1501.80] I think...
[1502.44 → 1504.22] What the heck is that?
[1504.22 → 1506.88] Hopefully you guys heard that because that was weird.
[1507.74 → 1512.60] I think the Zuck saw that happen and was like, I need that.
[1512.86 → 1514.34] I need to be able to own the platform.
[1514.74 → 1516.50] I need something that I can own the platform on.
[1516.94 → 1518.18] We tried the watch.
[1518.30 → 1519.30] We tried the portal.
[1519.54 → 1520.80] We tried all this other stuff.
[1521.46 → 1522.42] Remember the Facebook phone?
[1522.42 → 1523.58] None of that stuff is working.
[1523.78 → 1524.04] Yeah.
[1524.80 → 1525.52] Vaguely, yeah.
[1525.72 → 1526.58] But none of that worked.
[1526.90 → 1530.04] So they need to be first, basically.
[1530.04 → 1532.86] Apple was first to smartphone effectively.
[1532.86 → 1535.42] I know there were some other ones, but it was the first of that kind.
[1537.60 → 1540.36] And they've held dominance ever since.
[1540.84 → 1541.26] So like, yeah.
[1542.50 → 1545.84] The general path, I totally understand.
[1545.98 → 1547.16] I don't know if VR is it.
[1547.24 → 1548.00] I hope it is it.
[1548.04 → 1548.52] That'd be cool.
[1548.64 → 1552.50] Well, you've been rooting for VR basically since the first time you heard about it.
[1552.56 → 1552.86] It's just...
[1553.84 → 1554.10] Yeah.
[1554.20 → 1555.56] It's going slow, man.
[1555.72 → 1556.64] It's going slow.
[1556.72 → 1557.08] Yeah.
[1557.56 → 1560.28] And we knew the whole time that it was going to go really slow.
[1560.28 → 1564.96] I feel like, if anything, he put all his chips in too early.
[1565.08 → 1565.68] It's like that...
[1565.68 → 1566.02] What is that?
[1566.10 → 1567.42] The first...
[1567.42 → 1569.06] I almost said Need for Speed.
[1569.16 → 1569.82] Not Need for Speed.
[1570.00 → 1571.28] The first Fast and the Furious.
[1571.62 → 1573.08] When he's like, too soon, kid.
[1573.24 → 1575.02] When he uses his nitrous or whatever.
[1575.26 → 1576.88] I feel like it's that situation.
[1577.12 → 1579.68] Like, he probably sent it a little early.
[1579.68 → 1588.44] I think they should have kept doing like a decent amount of investment, but nothing as insane as they're doing right now.
[1588.54 → 1593.82] And then once it was a little bit more ready for them to actually hit it, that's when to go.
[1594.06 → 1596.94] But this is quite the YOLO.
[1598.52 → 1598.96] Yeah.
[1600.02 → 1600.80] All right.
[1601.98 → 1603.34] And I mean, you know what?
[1603.34 → 1609.36] The huge trend overall right now is tech companies cutting their staff.
[1609.50 → 1611.34] I mean, Luke and I just have this like...
[1612.22 → 1615.86] I don't know how to describe it other than layoff porn.
[1616.10 → 1626.00] But in our Discord, like half of what the two of us have been talking about is just like posting articles to each other of companies that have laid off 10, 20, 30.
[1626.36 → 1628.92] I mean, Twitter was 50% of their staff.
[1628.92 → 1634.12] It's really rough out there right now.
[1635.72 → 1637.06] In other news...
[1637.06 → 1638.28] Yeah, it's been wild.
[1638.48 → 1647.88] If you feel like you have a lot to contribute to a platform like Flow plane or to the LTT Lab, then, you know, maybe get in touch.
[1648.32 → 1648.94] We're hiring.
[1649.62 → 1650.10] Yay!
[1650.38 → 1655.36] Not enough positions to make up for what's going on right now, but we are hiring.
[1655.36 → 1655.80] Yeah.
[1657.00 → 1657.36] Yeah.
[1657.36 → 1659.02] You want to bring on 11,000 people?
[1659.62 → 1676.42] So the discussion question here, coming back to Twitter and Facebook and, you know, the terrifying reality that right now the media that we consume is effectively controlled by two utterly unrelaxable billionaires, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.
[1676.42 → 1684.36] The question is, how likely is it that an alternative decentralized social website makes a comeback here?
[1684.78 → 1691.56] Is there any hope that this situation could actually lead to an improvement in the social media landscape?
[1693.98 → 1695.18] What are the odds?
[1695.18 → 1695.46] I don't know.
[1695.46 → 1701.08] Part of what makes a social platform usable is moderation.
[1702.22 → 1707.70] How can you possibly trust a decentralized website to moderate?
[1708.22 → 1711.74] And if it can't moderate, how will it ever be sustainable?
[1711.94 → 1719.16] People have shown time and time again that they are not willing to pay what infrastructure costs.
[1719.16 → 1730.56] The second, you know, whether it's YouTube trying to charge for 4K video or, I mean, Twitter trying to charge for this blue checkmark that could potentially keep the platform alive.
[1730.88 → 1734.44] People have shown again and again and again they're not interested.
[1734.84 → 1742.84] Their expectation from the Silicon Valley model that has worked for so long is that this is free.
[1743.40 → 1745.92] And so now all of a sudden, what, you want to charge?
[1746.12 → 1747.56] You want to charge for cloud storage?
[1747.76 → 1748.54] I'm outraged.
[1748.54 → 1751.26] So now what?
[1751.38 → 1759.04] Yeah, it's a fascinating problem because back in the day, privacy was king.
[1759.16 → 1760.32] People didn't want to be tracked.
[1760.46 → 1761.98] People didn't want all this type of stuff.
[1763.96 → 1768.46] And then there's an interesting thing, and we've talked about this too.
[1768.46 → 1776.94] When anything comes towards people's wallets, their stances on things can very rapidly and very strongly change.
[1776.94 → 1781.96] So the second it's like, they'll be like, oh, I want privacy.
[1782.12 → 1782.88] I want to own my data.
[1782.94 → 1784.20] I don't want people to be able to track me.
[1784.26 → 1786.80] And then they're like, I have to pay $4?
[1786.80 → 1789.94] Yeah, you can take all my tracking.
[1790.08 → 1791.44] You can take everything you want.
[1792.08 → 1793.00] I'll do whatever.
[1793.22 → 1801.74] I mean, there was a version of the Oculus Quest 2, the business one, that cost like twice as much or something like that, but didn't have all the Facebook tracking stuff in it.
[1801.78 → 1802.72] Nobody talks about that.
[1802.76 → 1803.42] Nobody bought it.
[1803.42 → 1808.04] But businesses, sure, but individual users, like, I don't know, a few hundred bucks, my soul?
[1808.24 → 1808.38] Sure.
[1808.76 → 1808.98] Okay.
[1809.88 → 1810.16] Right?
[1810.38 → 1811.28] Yep, exactly.
[1811.88 → 1814.42] Yeah, so like, I don't know, it's rough.
[1815.16 → 1827.88] Maybe if someone comes up with something that's, I know decentralized is already in this text, but if someone comes up with something that's like peer hosted, but peer hosted things.
[1827.88 → 1834.46] They have a tendency to evolve into a dumpster fire.
[1835.54 → 1835.84] Yeah.
[1835.96 → 1839.50] I'm not going to lay the blame on anyone in particular, but they really do.
[1840.74 → 1841.00] Yep.
[1842.30 → 1844.52] Yeah, it's like kind of problem, actually.
[1845.04 → 1846.20] So, I don't know.
[1847.42 → 1849.90] My gut reaction is like, nope, nope.
[1849.98 → 1851.56] The social space is like established.
[1851.56 → 1859.38] The only people that can step into it are setups like TikTok, where there's like, you know, kind of suspicious funding behind all of it and Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada.
[1859.80 → 1862.80] But then Discord kind of came out of nowhere as well.
[1863.14 → 1865.36] I mean, Discord's funding is a little suspicious too.
[1866.50 → 1867.60] That's true.
[1867.84 → 1868.60] But I think Discord...
[1868.60 → 1869.54] Just saying.
[1870.70 → 1874.70] Discord had an answer to a space that was totally messed up at the time.
[1874.70 → 1883.14] People were kind of done with the like Mumble, Ventral, TeamSpeak model.
[1883.36 → 1885.60] Again, people don't want to pay for anything.
[1886.70 → 1888.14] I mean, Mumble was free.
[1888.26 → 1893.38] People still didn't want to deal with just the obtuse setup process.
[1894.38 → 1895.16] Yeah, yeah.
[1896.74 → 1901.42] Skype kind of stepped in there for a really weird like one to two-year period.
[1901.42 → 1902.80] Almost accidentally though.
[1902.80 → 1905.10] Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[1905.58 → 1907.84] And then people abandoned it because it was horrible.
[1908.38 → 1911.58] So, Discord was able to holistically answer this question.
[1911.98 → 1915.06] But it's not like Facebook is going anywhere.
[1915.18 → 1915.80] It's not like Twitter's...
[1916.44 → 1917.38] Well, for now.
[1917.46 → 1917.78] Twitter.
[1917.88 → 1918.52] Going anywhere.
[1918.72 → 1918.92] Yeah.
[1919.98 → 1920.50] Yeah.
[1921.00 → 1921.94] That'll be interesting.
[1923.30 → 1923.80] But...
[1924.56 → 1927.16] IkingRGB in float plane chat asks,
[1927.24 → 1929.54] What do you think of the Twitter Blue business model compared to Discord?
[1929.66 → 1930.92] Aren't they basically the same thing?
[1930.92 → 1934.96] Well, the difference is that the Discord...
[1934.96 → 1935.88] What's it called?
[1935.98 → 1937.00] Nitro or whatever it is?
[1937.10 → 1937.24] Yeah.
[1937.70 → 1943.96] Nitro on Discord adds value with features that actually cost money.
[1944.52 → 1951.14] So, for example, one of the things you can do in Nitro is share your screen at a much higher resolution to the other people in your chat.
[1951.14 → 1959.86] That can have a very real value to gamers who want to kind of play Sneezy in a game like Escape from Markov, right?
[1959.98 → 1965.02] If they want to have a low latency stream where they can see where their allies are or whatever the case may be.
[1965.02 → 1968.08] What's the equivalent for Twitter Blue?
[1968.86 → 1969.08] What?
[1969.14 → 1969.98] I get some pixels?
[1970.68 → 1973.04] I get some pixels on my name?
[1973.46 → 1975.82] Like, that doesn't have a value to me.
[1975.86 → 1979.04] It doesn't enhance my experience in a meaningful way.
[1979.04 → 1982.70] And so, what Twitter tried to do...
[1982.70 → 1985.48] I should say Elon, because this is not Twitter the organization.
[1985.64 → 1986.24] This is Elon.
[1986.58 → 1993.50] Was without thinking about it, leap in, make verification, which was a clear thing that people valued.
[1993.68 → 1997.68] Because verification meant you, you know, had a big e-peen or whatever.
[1998.14 → 2000.52] So, take a thing that people valued and paywall it.
[2000.52 → 2005.58] And kind of pillar of current, like, social platforms as well.
[2005.68 → 2007.66] As you have, you have...
[2007.66 → 2010.20] And I know Twitter didn't exactly work this way.
[2010.64 → 2013.16] But it was somewhat close, you know?
[2013.34 → 2013.44] Yeah.
[2013.44 → 2020.62] You have creators that are trying to push on the platform and make careers out of posting on this thing, whatever it is.
[2021.28 → 2026.94] And they get some form of badge to be like, this is a real person who's trying to do this thing.
[2027.16 → 2027.46] Yes.
[2027.46 → 2028.32] That happens on YouTube.
[2028.46 → 2029.18] That happens on TikTok.
[2029.18 → 2031.16] That happens pretty much everywhere else.
[2031.44 → 2033.84] And that sort of happened on Twitter.
[2034.16 → 2037.28] But again, this is something that I feel like people are constantly forgetting.
[2037.54 → 2040.56] The whole verification process was a dumpster fire.
[2041.04 → 2041.14] Yeah.
[2041.30 → 2041.78] And...
[2041.78 → 2044.16] It had huge problems.
[2044.26 → 2047.82] And it existed for a reason that wasn't to make money.
[2048.32 → 2050.18] It existed to prevent these...
[2051.70 → 2053.98] It just barely existed.
[2054.40 → 2055.32] Well, okay.
[2055.42 → 2056.34] So, it barely existed.
[2056.34 → 2061.84] But it was to prevent this whole impersonation problem from spinning out of control.
[2062.16 → 2071.32] So, all of a sudden, making it something that you can pay for is obviously going to completely undermine the reason that it existed in the first place.
[2071.32 → 2076.68] A, it will turn the checkmark from something of value into something worthless.
[2076.68 → 2083.38] And B, it will make its entire value, which is to the platform, which is that it gets rid of impersonation.
[2083.50 → 2087.76] It doesn't get rid of it, but reduces impersonation problems and destroy it.
[2088.18 → 2088.68] So, it was just...
[2089.30 → 2091.50] I mean, I think this really raises the question.
[2091.50 → 2095.88] Is Elon's prior success a total accident?
[2096.18 → 2099.82] Or is it that he's just gotten arrogant from the prior success?
[2100.08 → 2106.28] Because it's pretty clear, looking at this, that these are not genius IQ moves.
[2107.82 → 2108.80] So, what's happening?
[2109.86 → 2112.16] My thing here is he...
[2112.16 → 2116.12] I think he knee-jerked on a joke to buy Twitter.
[2116.72 → 2119.58] And then it went a little too far.
[2119.68 → 2121.06] He tried to bail out...
[2121.50 → 2123.16] They forced him...
[2123.16 → 2132.36] He has a relatively recent thing talking about how he didn't actually see a reality where he was going to get stuck purchasing it.
[2133.46 → 2135.66] And then he did get stuck purchasing it.
[2136.18 → 2141.10] It was either get stuck purchasing it or pay, I think, like a $1 billion fine or something.
[2141.10 → 2142.42] Why didn't he just pay the billion?
[2143.06 → 2145.48] Because wasn't Twitter burning $3 million a day?
[2146.48 → 2150.90] He has absolute FM money and just doesn't care, I think.
[2150.90 → 2152.66] Right, so then why not pay the billion?
[2153.12 → 2155.14] I guess the damage to the ego would have been...
[2155.14 → 2155.78] I don't know.
[2155.96 → 2156.32] That's...
[2156.32 → 2156.60] Yeah.
[2156.84 → 2157.92] But then, hold on.
[2158.00 → 2160.56] He has effectively infinite money.
[2160.66 → 2161.04] But there's...
[2161.04 → 2163.46] And someone tried to call him on it, and he said,
[2163.72 → 2166.02] FM, and instead of paying the $1 billion fine,
[2166.40 → 2168.58] took it from them, fired all of them,
[2169.06 → 2171.54] trashed their house, and burned everything.
[2171.94 → 2173.54] I think that's what's happening.
[2173.54 → 2180.02] That doesn't seem big brain to me.
[2181.78 → 2183.54] I mean, sure.
[2183.70 → 2185.46] But again, he still has infinite money.
[2185.82 → 2186.16] It is like...
[2186.16 → 2188.04] When you have...
[2188.04 → 2189.38] He still has like...
[2189.38 → 2190.70] I'm assuming like, what?
[2191.70 → 2192.60] $150 billion?
[2192.96 → 2194.06] That's just a random guess.
[2194.06 → 2197.70] It's a lot less than that now.
[2197.82 → 2200.90] Tesla's stock where most of his wealth was tied up
[2200.90 → 2203.76] is a lot more down there than it was.
[2204.94 → 2207.46] Google says $188.1 billion.
[2208.50 → 2208.96] Yeah.
[2209.78 → 2210.72] I guess we'll have to...
[2210.72 → 2212.16] I don't know how recent that is.
[2212.78 → 2214.18] I guess we'll have to see.
[2214.80 → 2215.78] We'll have to see.
[2215.86 → 2216.04] Yeah.
[2216.04 → 2216.48] Yeah.
[2218.54 → 2219.18] I don't know.
[2219.40 → 2220.80] I just don't know.
[2220.90 → 2222.28] I just don't know what to...
[2222.28 → 2223.50] I don't know what to make of it
[2223.50 → 2225.80] because there have definitely been times
[2225.80 → 2227.08] that I look at what he's doing.
[2227.18 → 2229.10] I go, yeah, it's got to be like 4D chess.
[2229.56 → 2231.00] You know, I must just not understand
[2231.00 → 2232.26] the game he's playing right now.
[2232.96 → 2235.00] This game just looks like
[2235.00 → 2238.78] absolutely having not only bad ideas,
[2239.24 → 2241.76] but no idea whatsoever
[2241.76 → 2243.50] how to tell if your ideas are bad
[2243.50 → 2244.60] or how to manage people.
[2246.04 → 2249.44] And that's his whole thing.
[2249.56 → 2251.38] Is he supposed to be a smart business manager?
[2251.82 → 2253.08] Like that's his whole image.
[2256.10 → 2256.54] Yeah.
[2256.84 → 2260.38] Again, I feel like he's just trying to light the room on fire.
[2261.68 → 2264.40] But yeah, apparently updated as of yesterday,
[2264.58 → 2266.90] he is at $199.8 billion.
[2267.64 → 2268.74] That's a lot of billions.
[2270.12 → 2271.24] That's a lot of billions.
[2271.24 → 2273.36] It's entirely too many billions.
[2274.04 → 2275.72] So like, okay, he lost.
[2276.04 → 2276.88] He still has $240.
[2277.18 → 2278.26] He still has $200.
[2280.10 → 2280.92] Nothing matters.
[2281.02 → 2281.78] He has infinite money.
[2282.16 → 2282.54] I don't know.
[2283.68 → 2284.46] Yeah, okay.
[2284.60 → 2286.58] I think it was worth it to him.
[2286.88 → 2288.60] Even if what he ends up doing
[2288.60 → 2292.40] is just completely nuking it.
[2292.72 → 2294.18] I think it was worth it to him
[2294.18 → 2297.98] for all those people that were like laughing at him
[2297.98 → 2298.22] and going,
[2298.32 → 2299.44] ha ha ha, we got you.
[2299.44 → 2302.00] You have to pay us a billion dollars now.
[2302.12 → 2304.04] I think he's going like,
[2305.08 → 2306.50] no, I'm going to buy the whole thing
[2306.50 → 2309.32] and just fire all of you and nuke everything.
[2309.78 → 2311.88] Here's my response to that.
[2311.88 → 2317.10] I think that if the pride or the PR,
[2317.26 → 2321.02] negative PR implications of paying the billion dollars
[2321.02 → 2324.96] was what made him go through with the purchase,
[2325.66 → 2331.52] I think the only way he thinks going through with it looks better
[2331.52 → 2333.92] is if he actually thinks he can run the thing.
[2333.92 → 2336.84] And he did.
[2337.00 → 2340.66] He tweeted out these simplistic solutions for problems
[2340.66 → 2343.34] that just obviously weren't going to work
[2343.34 → 2345.00] and wouldn't listen to anybody
[2345.00 → 2346.86] about how they were obviously bad.
[2347.26 → 2349.10] I just can't fathom it.
[2350.80 → 2352.10] Anyway, there's other news.
[2352.20 → 2353.54] I think it's a very different thing
[2353.54 → 2356.54] than the companies that he has run outside of this.
[2356.70 → 2357.10] Well, yeah.
[2357.18 → 2360.06] Content moderation is the worst job in the world.
[2361.26 → 2361.52] Yeah.
[2361.52 → 2363.52] And social platforms are very...
[2363.52 → 2365.62] He went from maps and payments
[2365.62 → 2368.14] to cars and spaceships
[2368.14 → 2371.28] and other very high technical,
[2371.94 → 2376.56] make an extremely complicated top-of-the-line device or thing
[2376.56 → 2378.76] and have people buy or use it.
[2379.60 → 2382.60] And it is a product that you package and you deliver.
[2382.96 → 2384.16] This is now...
[2384.16 → 2387.70] He's entering the webspace where nothing makes money.
[2387.70 → 2391.38] Everything burns millions or billions of dollars.
[2391.56 → 2392.96] He took one of those companies
[2392.96 → 2394.00] and took it private,
[2394.00 → 2395.06] which is just...
[2395.06 → 2397.00] That just doesn't work.
[2397.66 → 2400.64] Like, it actually doesn't
[2400.64 → 2402.08] because they don't make money.
[2402.88 → 2404.46] So there's an issue.
[2405.24 → 2408.12] And I think he just has no idea what he's doing
[2408.12 → 2410.06] but was unwilling to pay the $1 billion
[2410.06 → 2414.10] because it would have been a loss, I think.
[2414.10 → 2417.04] Like, not a loss of money.
[2417.14 → 2419.32] I don't think he probably cared as much about that.
[2419.32 → 2422.96] I think it would be a strategic loss, if that makes sense.
[2424.06 → 2426.08] The people on the board would have beat him
[2426.08 → 2428.12] and he probably didn't like that.
[2428.82 → 2429.44] That's my guess.
[2429.52 → 2429.94] I have no idea.
[2430.14 → 2433.28] Well, I got nothing else other than this is hilarious
[2433.28 → 2435.90] and I will be continuing to watch it
[2435.90 → 2437.70] because it's hilarious.
[2437.70 → 2440.82] There were some NVIDIA shenanigans this week.
[2441.34 → 2446.62] The GPU formerly known as RTX 4080 12GB is back.
[2447.04 → 2448.82] Now it's the 4070 Ti
[2448.82 → 2453.00] and it still hates your wallet with a passion.
[2453.80 → 2456.70] A historically accurate leaker, Copite7Kini,
[2457.40 → 2461.02] gave details about the new 4070 Ti.
[2461.02 → 2465.78] When the 4080 12GB was announced in September,
[2465.90 → 2466.84] the card was panned
[2466.84 → 2469.24] for its approximately 30% lower performance
[2469.24 → 2470.84] than the 4080 16GB.
[2471.38 → 2474.08] After criticism, NVIDIA cancelled the 12GB card
[2474.08 → 2477.84] but made no comment about the fate of the AD104 GPU
[2477.84 → 2478.82] that it was built around.
[2479.38 → 2483.72] So, the 4070 Ti is rumoured to have the same 7680 CUBA cores
[2483.72 → 2486.48] and 12GB of 192-bit GDDR6X.
[2486.48 → 2491.96] Um, and while it was originally expected
[2491.96 → 2493.52] to have a $900 MSRP,
[2493.94 → 2496.88] the recent announcement of the RX 7900 XT
[2496.88 → 2499.24] may cause NVIDIA to reconsider this price.
[2499.70 → 2501.28] Though, they have to be careful right now
[2501.28 → 2503.78] not to cannibalize their 3000 series cards
[2503.78 → 2506.24] that they seem to still have a lot of stock of.
[2506.90 → 2508.96] So then this 4070 non-Ti
[2508.96 → 2511.16] is expected to be based on the same core
[2511.16 → 2513.40] but likely not the full version of it.
[2513.90 → 2515.38] And both are expected to release.
[2515.38 → 2519.90] So, 4070 Ti and non-Ti in January 2023.
[2522.22 → 2523.36] In other news,
[2523.62 → 2526.94] the RTX 4080 16GB appears to be around the corner.
[2527.44 → 2530.24] Prices currently range from $1,200 to $1,550
[2530.24 → 2531.26] at Micro Centre
[2531.26 → 2533.66] who has 13 listings of custom cards up.
[2534.60 → 2537.04] That's based on an MSRP of $1,200.
[2538.64 → 2540.52] NVIDIA requested that all board partners
[2540.52 → 2542.14] should have at least one model of MSRP
[2542.14 → 2543.08] available at launch
[2543.08 → 2544.12] and this is fascinating.
[2544.12 → 2546.98] So, that's an interesting bullet point.
[2547.08 → 2549.40] So, remember when VGA publicly broke up
[2549.40 → 2550.30] with NVIDIA recently?
[2551.58 → 2551.88] Yeah.
[2552.02 → 2553.36] Yeah, I was already aware
[2553.36 → 2555.68] of NVIDIA's little requests
[2555.68 → 2556.96] to their board partners
[2556.96 → 2560.34] to have something available at MSRP at launch.
[2560.48 → 2561.74] So, you know how that works?
[2562.40 → 2562.96] That whole thing?
[2564.96 → 2567.32] Uh, wouldn't that mean that they make nothing?
[2567.32 → 2568.66] Well, okay.
[2568.66 → 2571.44] So, they make nothing at launch.
[2571.60 → 2573.96] So, you know how it would always happen
[2573.96 → 2576.18] that at launch there would be like a
[2576.60 → 2577.94] like a, uh, uh, uh,
[2577.94 → 2581.28] an 8800 KO or whatever.
[2581.28 → 2582.78] There'd be a particular version.
[2582.92 → 2584.28] It would have like two fans
[2584.28 → 2587.04] and then you would order that
[2587.04 → 2588.96] and it would be on back order forever.
[2588.96 → 2591.18] But the Super Clock
[2591.18 → 2592.46] and Super, Super Clock
[2592.46 → 2593.52] and KO Plus
[2593.52 → 2594.28] and whatever,
[2594.74 → 2595.32] FTW,
[2595.42 → 2596.48] would all be in stock
[2596.48 → 2598.04] and then the computer store
[2598.04 → 2598.88] would call you and say,
[2598.96 → 2599.70] hey, would you like to switch
[2599.70 → 2600.62] to one of these other cards?
[2600.68 → 2601.86] It's another 30 or 40 bucks.
[2603.78 → 2604.14] Yeah.
[2604.26 → 2605.60] That's how they would handle that
[2605.60 → 2607.54] because NVIDIA's pricing,
[2607.92 → 2608.24] the MSRPs
[2608.90 → 2610.26] that they get to advertise
[2610.26 → 2611.84] to you, the end user,
[2612.38 → 2613.46] um, are not,
[2613.52 → 2614.24] are not real.
[2614.32 → 2615.84] They don't actually have enough margin
[2615.84 → 2617.10] in them for the board partners
[2617.10 → 2618.90] to hit those prices in the long term.
[2619.32 → 2620.12] So board partners
[2620.12 → 2622.22] would quietly discontinue
[2622.22 → 2625.12] that particular RTX or GTX,
[2625.28 → 2625.66] whatever.
[2626.10 → 2626.64] And then they'd have
[2626.64 → 2628.36] these other ones later on
[2628.36 → 2629.22] when NVIDIA is willing
[2629.22 → 2630.12] to turn a blind eye.
[2630.40 → 2632.02] So guys, keep a close eye
[2632.02 → 2633.66] over the next six months
[2633.66 → 2636.16] on 30, 80, 16,
[2636.38 → 2637.20] excuse me, 30, 80,
[2637.30 → 2639.06] 40, 80, 16 gig cards
[2639.06 → 2642.48] and watch those MSRP boards
[2642.48 → 2643.34] that are available
[2643.34 → 2646.58] will slowly start to drop away
[2646.58 → 2648.00] being replaced by ones
[2648.00 → 2649.04] that cost another 50,
[2649.16 → 2650.94] 100, 150 dollars more.
[2651.46 → 2652.74] And I don't blame
[2652.74 → 2653.40] the board partners.
[2653.60 → 2655.26] I for real do not blame
[2655.26 → 2656.36] the board partners.
[2657.56 → 2658.90] There's a third rumour,
[2659.16 → 2660.36] more NVIDIA shenanigans.
[2660.80 → 2662.02] The RTX 2060
[2662.02 → 2663.72] has apparently been discontinued.
[2664.14 → 2665.80] According to a Chinese tech forum post
[2665.80 → 2667.30] citing supply chain sources,
[2667.86 → 2669.56] both the RTX 2060
[2669.56 → 2670.50] and 2060 Super
[2670.50 → 2671.86] will shortly be discontinued.
[2672.48 → 2673.56] GPUs for these boards
[2673.56 → 2674.94] have stopped reaching partners,
[2675.32 → 2675.76] apparently.
[2675.76 → 2676.90] Um,
[2677.56 → 2679.14] so,
[2679.62 → 2680.14] yeah,
[2680.50 → 2682.08] if the price is rumoured
[2682.08 → 2682.82] to be the same
[2682.82 → 2684.06] for the 4070 Ti,
[2684.86 → 2685.34] okay,
[2685.98 → 2686.26] uh,
[2686.26 → 2687.76] and the GPU is the same,
[2688.14 → 2689.82] should we still be just as mad
[2689.82 → 2690.72] now that they've given it
[2690.72 → 2691.24] a new name?
[2692.98 → 2693.50] Well,
[2693.54 → 2694.24] isn't the name
[2694.24 → 2696.24] better?
[2696.92 → 2698.28] I guess the name is better,
[2698.40 → 2698.98] but it's still
[2698.98 → 2700.36] 30% less performance
[2700.36 → 2701.86] than a 4080 16 gig
[2701.86 → 2704.08] for $900.
[2705.64 → 2706.10] Oh,
[2706.18 → 2706.36] yeah,
[2706.44 → 2707.46] it's complete BS.
[2707.86 → 2708.00] I,
[2708.20 → 2709.82] I,
[2709.90 → 2710.90] I would have said
[2710.90 → 2712.08] that this feels like
[2712.08 → 2713.10] a move by NVIDIA
[2713.10 → 2714.32] to push
[2714.32 → 2715.08] the
[2715.08 → 2716.18] uh,
[2716.24 → 2717.74] below 80 bracket
[2717.74 → 2719.14] closer to $1,000
[2719.14 → 2721.14] if it was premeditated.
[2721.14 → 2722.82] Because it's not premeditated,
[2722.94 → 2723.06] I,
[2723.18 → 2724.56] I have no idea.
[2724.76 → 2724.88] Yeah,
[2724.92 → 2725.58] it's just ridiculous.
[2725.58 → 2726.58] It doesn't seem to be
[2726.58 → 2727.64] 4D chess at all.
[2728.12 → 2728.44] That's,
[2728.62 → 2728.82] honestly,
[2728.82 → 2730.68] I'm getting real disillusioned
[2730.68 → 2730.96] lately.
[2731.66 → 2733.46] There's been so many times
[2733.46 → 2734.40] I see moves
[2734.40 → 2734.76] from,
[2734.76 → 2736.24] big corporations
[2736.24 → 2737.88] who probably have
[2737.88 → 2738.52] a lot better
[2738.52 → 2739.58] of a PR department
[2739.58 → 2740.36] than I do.
[2740.86 → 2741.24] Um,
[2741.28 → 2741.48] you know,
[2741.50 → 2742.52] a lot more lawyers,
[2743.02 → 2743.32] uh,
[2743.34 → 2744.14] a lot more
[2744.14 → 2745.36] accountants
[2745.36 → 2746.04] and advisors.
[2746.46 → 2747.62] And I see them just,
[2747.72 → 2748.94] I see them doing stuff
[2748.94 → 2750.32] and it kind of,
[2750.40 → 2750.66] you know,
[2751.08 → 2751.78] when you're young,
[2751.78 → 2753.00] I feel like you've got faith
[2753.00 → 2754.14] in the system a little bit,
[2754.26 → 2754.60] you know?
[2755.32 → 2755.76] Like,
[2755.84 → 2756.00] yeah,
[2756.46 → 2756.74] uh,
[2756.74 → 2757.72] smart people,
[2757.94 → 2758.92] competent people
[2758.92 → 2759.38] with,
[2759.62 → 2760.90] with a good vision
[2760.90 → 2761.76] for the future
[2761.76 → 2762.20] and,
[2762.62 → 2763.90] and a good team around them
[2763.90 → 2764.52] are the ones
[2764.52 → 2765.90] doing stuff
[2765.90 → 2767.06] and making decisions
[2767.06 → 2767.66] and,
[2767.76 → 2768.32] and,
[2768.50 → 2768.78] you know,
[2768.86 → 2769.70] making sure that,
[2769.80 → 2771.00] keeping the barbarians,
[2771.16 → 2771.40] you know,
[2771.46 → 2772.22] off our shores
[2772.22 → 2772.74] or whatever.
[2772.92 → 2773.46] You know what I mean?
[2774.26 → 2774.50] And,
[2774.68 → 2774.80] yeah,
[2774.90 → 2776.06] it's really quite a
[2776.06 → 2776.92] disappointing moment
[2776.92 → 2777.96] when you grow up
[2777.96 → 2778.64] to the point
[2778.64 → 2779.26] where you realize
[2779.26 → 2780.10] that all the old people
[2780.10 → 2780.80] are just as stupid
[2780.80 → 2781.32] as you are.
[2781.90 → 2782.26] Yeah.
[2783.84 → 2784.24] Yeah,
[2784.36 → 2784.68] that.
[2784.88 → 2785.02] Yeah.
[2785.96 → 2786.18] Yeah.
[2786.26 → 2786.70] Because I don't,
[2786.88 → 2787.58] half the time
[2787.58 → 2788.28] I don't feel like
[2788.28 → 2789.46] I know what's going on,
[2789.58 → 2790.58] but then I look at
[2790.58 → 2791.06] our success
[2791.06 → 2792.04] and I kind of go,
[2792.54 → 2792.88] like,
[2792.88 → 2794.84] man,
[2795.04 → 2795.50] um,
[2797.44 → 2797.84] huh.
[2798.98 → 2799.42] So,
[2799.72 → 2800.88] even though we have,
[2801.02 → 2801.12] like,
[2801.24 → 2801.92] internally,
[2802.02 → 2802.58] I feel like we got
[2802.58 → 2803.36] a lot of problems,
[2803.44 → 2803.74] you know?
[2804.22 → 2804.88] And yet,
[2805.04 → 2805.44] somehow,
[2805.68 → 2806.46] our execution
[2806.46 → 2807.26] gets us as,
[2807.32 → 2808.58] as far as we've gotten.
[2809.04 → 2809.80] And it just,
[2810.00 → 2812.26] it just has shaken my,
[2812.34 → 2813.56] it's shaken my belief.
[2813.94 → 2814.26] Okay?
[2814.30 → 2815.54] It's shaken my trust
[2815.54 → 2817.50] that people know
[2817.50 → 2818.16] what they're doing.
[2819.16 → 2819.64] It's all I'm,
[2819.80 → 2820.98] it's all I got to say.
[2821.10 → 2821.84] It's all I got to say
[2821.84 → 2822.36] about that.
[2823.04 → 2823.22] Uh,
[2823.22 → 2823.42] people,
[2823.58 → 2824.44] did Linus just dunk
[2824.44 → 2825.30] on his own PR team?
[2825.36 → 2826.28] We don't have one.
[2826.46 → 2827.48] That's the joke.
[2828.14 → 2828.58] Whoosh.
[2829.02 → 2829.28] Yeah.
[2830.04 → 2830.44] Yeah.
[2832.32 → 2832.72] Oh,
[2832.72 → 2833.18] man.
[2833.78 → 2834.18] Um,
[2834.92 → 2835.34] hey,
[2835.64 → 2836.42] speaking of,
[2836.52 → 2837.46] speaking of success,
[2837.54 → 2838.90] you guys are a huge part of it.
[2839.12 → 2840.54] If you are looking
[2840.54 → 2841.30] to send in a message
[2841.30 → 2841.88] to the show,
[2841.98 → 2843.26] which I will be
[2843.26 → 2844.44] going through all of them
[2844.44 → 2846.28] once Luke gets on his flight,
[2846.28 → 2847.58] maybe we'll do a couple
[2847.58 → 2848.34] of them beforehand.
[2848.34 → 2849.06] But if you want to send
[2849.06 → 2849.96] in a message to the show,
[2850.08 → 2851.44] it's through merch messages.
[2851.44 → 2852.56] We've actually got a couple
[2852.56 → 2853.88] big launches on the store
[2853.88 → 2854.48] this week.
[2854.60 → 2855.92] If you guys were looking
[2855.92 → 2856.90] for something fancy
[2856.90 → 2857.54] to pick up,
[2857.82 → 2858.02] Luke,
[2858.08 → 2859.30] you might appreciate this.
[2859.64 → 2859.90] Uh,
[2859.90 → 2860.98] we're launching a puzzle.
[2861.56 → 2862.58] It's pretty affordable.
[2862.82 → 2863.54] $19.99
[2863.54 → 2864.66] for a puzzle
[2864.66 → 2866.92] featuring our CPU graphic.
[2867.22 → 2868.12] And it's available
[2868.12 → 2869.54] in three styles.
[2869.82 → 2870.80] You can get the
[2870.80 → 2872.46] 1,000 piece version
[2872.46 → 2872.98] of the puzzle,
[2873.08 → 2874.48] which is quite challenging.
[2874.48 → 2876.72] You can get the 100 piece
[2876.72 → 2877.52] version of the puzzle,
[2877.72 → 2878.70] which is more like
[2878.70 → 2879.50] if you just want to
[2879.50 → 2880.68] kind of put it together
[2880.68 → 2881.32] and be like,
[2881.40 → 2882.06] I did that.
[2882.54 → 2882.82] Um,
[2882.88 → 2883.04] yeah,
[2883.12 → 2883.84] pretty big pieces
[2883.84 → 2884.46] on that one.
[2884.66 → 2885.14] Or,
[2885.40 → 2886.70] if you don't really like
[2886.70 → 2887.66] putting puzzles together
[2887.66 → 2888.38] at all,
[2888.78 → 2889.48] you can get the
[2889.48 → 2890.40] one piece version
[2890.40 → 2890.94] of the puzzle,
[2891.18 → 2892.64] which has all the pieces
[2892.64 → 2894.76] of the 1,000 piece version
[2894.76 → 2896.50] only half cut.
[2896.70 → 2898.26] So you can look like
[2898.26 → 2898.94] you put together
[2898.94 → 2900.16] a whole 1,000-piece puzzle
[2900.16 → 2901.34] if you just like the graphic
[2901.34 → 2902.30] and you want to put it up
[2902.30 → 2902.74] and be like,
[2902.86 → 2903.04] yeah,
[2903.08 → 2903.66] I made a puzzle.
[2903.66 → 2904.84] And you can just hang
[2904.84 → 2905.50] that on your wall.
[2905.98 → 2906.70] So that's the
[2906.78 → 2907.04] um,
[2907.36 → 2908.78] that's the
[2908.78 → 2912.34] the poser,
[2912.66 → 2914.04] the poser skew
[2914.04 → 2914.88] for the puzzle.
[2915.94 → 2917.20] The 1 piece.
[2917.42 → 2918.46] Is this a thing?
[2918.66 → 2918.86] Like,
[2918.98 → 2919.16] is,
[2919.44 → 2920.40] do people do this?
[2920.50 → 2921.26] I have no idea.
[2921.30 → 2922.06] I've never heard
[2922.06 → 2922.72] of that before.
[2922.80 → 2923.36] We did it.
[2924.08 → 2924.32] I,
[2924.56 → 2926.20] I don't remember
[2926.20 → 2927.44] whose idea it was,
[2927.48 → 2928.18] but it seems like
[2928.18 → 2928.80] the kind of thing
[2928.80 → 2930.14] that's on the subject
[2930.14 → 2930.54] of,
[2930.82 → 2931.10] you know,
[2931.10 → 2931.92] is our leadership
[2931.92 → 2932.86] actually,
[2932.86 → 2933.44] uh,
[2933.44 → 2933.82] competent
[2933.82 → 2935.38] or are they just stupid?
[2935.98 → 2936.26] Um,
[2936.52 → 2937.58] I'm pretty sure
[2937.58 → 2938.72] that was a thing
[2938.72 → 2940.10] because we were discussing.
[2940.10 → 2940.68] I can't tell.
[2941.40 → 2941.80] Yeah,
[2941.86 → 2942.08] go ahead.
[2942.12 → 2943.78] I can't tell if it's an anime meme
[2943.78 → 2944.56] or if like,
[2944.56 → 2945.76] it's actually a good idea.
[2945.98 → 2947.20] I don't know.
[2947.74 → 2948.34] I really,
[2948.48 → 2950.18] I really don't know either.
[2950.42 → 2950.78] Uh,
[2950.78 → 2951.54] we had actually,
[2951.76 → 2952.36] I do,
[2952.44 → 2953.00] I'm pretty sure
[2953.00 → 2953.96] this is my idea actually
[2953.96 → 2954.80] now that I think about it
[2954.80 → 2956.52] because the original concept,
[2956.76 → 2956.90] uh,
[2956.90 → 2957.90] this is a Lloyd project
[2957.90 → 2960.14] and he likes difficult puzzles.
[2960.40 → 2960.92] Pay to win puzzle.
[2961.40 → 2961.68] Um,
[2961.88 → 2963.40] does it cost more?
[2963.50 → 2963.66] No,
[2963.72 → 2963.82] no,
[2963.82 → 2964.46] it should cost the same.
[2964.52 → 2964.62] No,
[2964.64 → 2965.18] it costs the same.
[2965.24 → 2965.68] It costs the same.
[2965.96 → 2967.24] The shipping's probably more
[2967.24 → 2969.20] because it's so big,
[2969.20 → 2970.50] but I,
[2970.50 → 2971.84] I remember the conversation
[2971.84 → 2973.66] because Lloyd likes difficult puzzles
[2973.66 → 2974.94] and this artwork
[2974.94 → 2976.26] is challenging.
[2976.26 → 2976.64] Like,
[2976.70 → 2977.90] this is going to be a hard puzzle
[2977.90 → 2978.30] to build,
[2978.38 → 2979.60] the thousand piece version of it.
[2980.04 → 2980.34] Uh,
[2980.38 → 2981.32] so I was like,
[2981.34 → 2981.48] yeah,
[2981.48 → 2982.70] but like not everyone wants to build
[2982.70 → 2983.50] like a really hard puzzle
[2983.50 → 2984.66] because I wouldn't be that into that.
[2985.16 → 2985.52] Um,
[2985.62 → 2986.22] and so I was like,
[2986.24 → 2986.34] oh,
[2986.34 → 2987.62] why don't we do like easier ones?
[2987.66 → 2989.04] Let's do like a hundred piece version.
[2989.20 → 2990.28] And then I think I pitched
[2990.28 → 2991.34] like a four piece.
[2991.68 → 2994.56] So it's just like four big pieces,
[2994.56 → 2996.10] but then I thought that would look
[2996.10 → 2997.30] really stupid on the wall.
[2997.50 → 2998.06] So I,
[2998.22 → 2998.40] yeah,
[2998.40 → 2998.78] this is,
[2998.90 → 2999.66] this was totally me.
[2999.74 → 3000.90] So I asked,
[3001.20 → 3001.62] um,
[3001.66 → 3003.90] I asked whether we could ask the supplier
[3003.90 → 3006.16] because obviously they must just
[3006.16 → 3008.12] print the whole thing in one go
[3008.12 → 3009.38] and then die cut it.
[3009.42 → 3009.80] I was like,
[3009.80 → 3011.62] can they just push the die down halfway?
[3012.02 → 3012.96] And then that way,
[3013.04 → 3014.88] instead of it being obvious
[3014.88 → 3015.84] that they're a poser,
[3015.84 → 3017.20] with their four piece
[3017.20 → 3018.88] or nine-piece puzzle on the wall,
[3018.98 → 3020.72] they can look like they put together
[3020.72 → 3021.34] the hard one
[3021.34 → 3022.90] and still get that puzzle look,
[3023.06 → 3024.92] but easy mode.
[3024.92 → 3025.44] Um,
[3025.44 → 3028.46] so,
[3028.72 → 3029.08] uh,
[3029.16 → 3029.54] yeah,
[3030.00 → 3030.46] uh,
[3030.82 → 3033.08] Jake from the lab is in float plane chat
[3033.08 → 3033.44] saying,
[3033.48 → 3033.68] uh,
[3033.68 → 3034.88] Lloyd is a puzzle God.
[3034.96 → 3035.82] It took him ages.
[3035.96 → 3036.08] Yeah.
[3036.08 → 3038.02] The thousand piece is very difficult.
[3038.26 → 3039.22] So if you want,
[3039.36 → 3040.92] if you want to take the easy path,
[3040.94 → 3043.14] you definitely want the hundred piece
[3043.14 → 3043.56] or,
[3043.56 → 3044.14] uh,
[3044.14 → 3044.94] the one piece.
[3045.04 → 3045.78] That's like,
[3045.78 → 3046.10] uh,
[3046.10 → 3046.78] story mode,
[3047.04 → 3047.36] you know,
[3047.36 → 3048.44] in your favourite games.
[3049.24 → 3049.72] Yeah.
[3050.04 → 3051.08] The one piece,
[3051.08 → 3052.26] uh,
[3052.34 → 3052.50] I,
[3052.58 → 3053.70] the thousand piece,
[3053.88 → 3054.00] the
[3054.12 → 3055.50] the fact that the lines,
[3055.66 → 3057.10] like the angled lines,
[3057.10 → 3058.48] uh,
[3058.66 → 3059.80] I don't even know how to describe it
[3059.80 → 3060.62] or like jagged,
[3060.66 → 3061.68] like they don't line up
[3061.68 → 3062.64] is insane.
[3062.90 → 3063.74] That's nuts.
[3064.56 → 3065.76] That'd be so hard.
[3065.76 → 3068.22] We even did a lot to make it easier.
[3068.22 → 3069.12] Like this,
[3069.22 → 3069.60] um,
[3069.66 → 3070.92] this pattern in the background
[3070.92 → 3072.74] wasn't there in the first version.
[3073.28 → 3073.80] And,
[3074.36 → 3074.94] um,
[3075.04 → 3078.40] I think we added some different textures
[3078.40 → 3080.28] to the gold in the centre
[3080.28 → 3081.92] for the CPU as well.
[3082.04 → 3082.52] Like,
[3082.56 → 3082.78] uh,
[3082.78 → 3084.94] Lloyd and I went back and forth a lot
[3084.94 → 3086.72] on how to make this design
[3086.72 → 3088.80] slightly less punishing,
[3088.80 → 3091.64] but it is absolutely difficult.
[3092.00 → 3092.02] Uh,
[3092.02 → 3092.70] Tynan says,
[3092.78 → 3094.02] I was a tester for this.
[3094.30 → 3095.12] My goodness.
[3095.12 → 3096.36] It was insane.
[3096.74 → 3098.30] I puzzled with my family.
[3098.48 → 3098.76] I've,
[3098.84 → 3100.46] I puzzled with my family every year
[3100.46 → 3102.14] and have done for a long time.
[3102.42 → 3102.58] Yeah.
[3102.60 → 3104.02] It's a difficult puzzle.
[3104.26 → 3106.28] I will be very curious to see.
[3106.44 → 3106.88] So I'll,
[3106.88 → 3107.70] I'll be watching this.
[3107.76 → 3108.72] I'll try and remember to update
[3108.72 → 3109.70] you guys on the show.
[3109.82 → 3110.22] Uh,
[3110.22 → 3111.58] because I can see the skew mix
[3111.58 → 3113.14] for what people actually buy,
[3113.82 → 3114.46] um,
[3114.94 → 3115.42] on my,
[3115.50 → 3116.52] on my app on the phone here.
[3116.56 → 3117.44] So if you guys are picking up
[3117.44 → 3118.40] the puzzle right now
[3118.40 → 3119.10] during the show,
[3119.20 → 3119.58] right,
[3119.62 → 3120.34] when you're in the checkout,
[3120.44 → 3121.42] you can leave a merch message
[3121.42 → 3122.16] and it'll get sent.
[3122.16 → 3123.30] Either bell will reply
[3123.30 → 3124.48] or it'll pop up down there
[3124.48 → 3125.26] or I'll talk about it
[3125.26 → 3125.90] later on the show.
[3126.10 → 3127.24] I'll be really curious
[3127.24 → 3128.50] to see what the mix is.
[3129.58 → 3130.30] Oh my God.
[3130.54 → 3131.66] Speed run puzzle build.
[3131.88 → 3132.40] You should,
[3132.66 → 3133.60] we should do a thing.
[3133.70 → 3134.90] I'm pitching this live.
[3135.00 → 3135.52] This is scary.
[3135.68 → 3136.66] We should do a thing
[3136.66 → 3138.40] where if people film
[3138.40 → 3140.34] their puzzle builds
[3140.34 → 3141.44] and they speed run it,
[3141.50 → 3142.66] like the top speed runner
[3142.66 → 3143.96] gets like a shirt or something.
[3144.64 → 3144.92] Oh,
[3144.94 → 3145.72] that'd be kind of cool.
[3147.10 → 3147.46] Uh,
[3147.46 → 3148.42] there are too many ways
[3148.42 → 3148.92] to cheat.
[3149.02 → 3149.32] I think,
[3149.44 → 3150.58] I think it would have to be
[3150.58 → 3151.74] from box open
[3151.74 → 3152.68] and you have to like,
[3152.98 → 3153.12] is,
[3153.18 → 3153.86] is it wrapped?
[3154.72 → 3155.04] Uh,
[3155.06 → 3155.36] no,
[3155.60 → 3156.56] it comes in a little,
[3156.82 → 3157.16] uh,
[3157.16 → 3158.02] it comes in one of those
[3158.02 → 3159.48] little like drawstring bags,
[3159.58 → 3159.96] I think.
[3159.96 → 3161.00] So it comes in a tube
[3161.00 → 3163.00] and then it comes in a
[3163.00 → 3164.16] in a drawstring bag
[3164.16 → 3164.86] inside the tube.
[3164.92 → 3166.16] I'd have to find the packaging here.
[3166.24 → 3166.42] Yeah.
[3166.48 → 3166.78] Hold on.
[3166.84 → 3167.28] Here we go.
[3167.98 → 3168.38] Uh,
[3168.38 → 3169.90] so there's that complicated.
[3170.32 → 3170.54] No,
[3170.60 → 3170.72] yeah,
[3170.72 → 3171.18] there it is.
[3171.18 → 3171.70] There you go.
[3171.74 → 3172.08] There's a good,
[3172.08 → 3172.78] make it fair.
[3172.90 → 3173.86] I think it's too complicated.
[3175.34 → 3175.74] Yeah,
[3175.80 → 3176.56] you're probably right.
[3176.56 → 3177.44] Wow.
[3177.98 → 3178.84] So far,
[3179.12 → 3180.80] 100% of you
[3180.80 → 3181.24] want the
[3181.42 → 3181.90] the
[3181.90 → 3182.74] the thousand piece.
[3183.38 → 3184.60] You guys are apparently
[3184.60 → 3185.84] into difficult puzzles.
[3185.84 → 3186.48] So that's,
[3186.54 → 3186.72] uh,
[3186.72 → 3187.40] that's good to know.
[3187.70 → 3188.56] We'll keep that in mind
[3188.56 → 3189.18] for the future.
[3189.90 → 3190.08] The
[3190.28 → 3191.38] another thing to keep in mind
[3191.38 → 3192.82] for the future is,
[3192.98 → 3193.52] um,
[3193.74 → 3195.20] that we will no longer
[3195.20 → 3196.50] have the crew neck sweater
[3196.50 → 3198.30] available on the store.
[3198.80 → 3201.32] It is on close out right now.
[3201.74 → 3202.06] So,
[3202.36 → 3202.56] uh,
[3202.56 → 3202.82] guys,
[3202.94 → 3204.56] the last time we did a clearance
[3204.56 → 3206.14] thing like this,
[3206.14 → 3208.14] it went extremely quickly.
[3208.38 → 3208.82] Uh,
[3208.82 → 3210.40] it's marked down from 40 bucks
[3210.40 → 3211.82] to 24 99.
[3212.18 → 3213.28] You guys can read the reviews.
[3213.42 → 3215.50] It is an extremely beloved product
[3215.50 → 3216.14] on the store.
[3216.36 → 3216.80] Uh,
[3216.86 → 3218.16] tons of five-star reviews,
[3218.28 → 3220.54] but we are doing away with it.
[3220.64 → 3222.04] It's just one of our older products.
[3222.04 → 3223.76] So now is a time to pick up
[3223.76 → 3225.14] the remaining sizes
[3225.14 → 3226.08] that are available.
[3226.34 → 3227.02] Do we have,
[3227.08 → 3227.22] yeah,
[3227.34 → 3228.14] oh yeah,
[3228.14 → 3228.46] yeah,
[3228.54 → 3229.48] we have every size available.
[3229.62 → 3230.16] So you guys are going to want
[3230.16 → 3231.24] to move pretty quick on that.
[3231.70 → 3231.92] Finally,
[3231.92 → 3232.60] I have an update
[3232.60 → 3234.56] on the shoelace situation.
[3235.28 → 3235.46] Luke,
[3235.52 → 3236.62] you're going to get a kick out of this.
[3237.06 → 3238.16] We heard from a few buyers
[3238.16 → 3239.16] that their box
[3239.16 → 3240.06] only included
[3240.06 → 3241.30] a single shoelace,
[3241.96 → 3242.80] which is obviously
[3242.80 → 3243.88] not the intent.
[3244.42 → 3245.64] Upon further investigation,
[3245.98 → 3246.86] after we've shipped out
[3246.86 → 3247.94] over a thousand of these,
[3248.12 → 3249.26] it looks like the factory
[3249.26 → 3249.92] we worked with
[3249.92 → 3250.60] did in fact
[3250.60 → 3251.38] only include
[3251.38 → 3252.72] one shoelace per box.
[3253.88 → 3255.04] On all of them?
[3255.20 → 3256.02] Every single one?
[3256.10 → 3256.46] Clearly,
[3256.60 → 3257.50] this is a mistake,
[3257.50 → 3259.16] and we will be sending out
[3259.16 → 3260.94] a second shoelace
[3260.94 → 3261.84] to everyone
[3261.84 → 3263.08] who has ordered shoelaces
[3263.08 → 3263.64] through us
[3263.64 → 3264.68] up until this point.
[3265.36 → 3266.80] And all new orders
[3266.80 → 3267.90] should receive
[3267.90 → 3269.36] the proper two shoelaces
[3269.36 → 3270.44] with their order.
[3270.76 → 3271.02] Hey,
[3271.50 → 3272.40] when I was a kid,
[3272.44 → 3273.12] it was fashionable
[3273.12 → 3274.40] to mix your shoelaces.
[3274.62 → 3275.28] Maybe we were just
[3275.28 → 3276.14] trying to bring that back.
[3276.30 → 3276.70] Yeah,
[3277.02 → 3277.40] no,
[3277.70 → 3278.18] that's not what
[3278.18 → 3278.86] we were trying to do.
[3278.98 → 3279.62] We were trying to have
[3279.62 → 3280.88] both of your shoelaces
[3280.88 → 3281.96] match your hoodie.
[3281.96 → 3283.72] So that's really not
[3283.72 → 3285.16] what we meant to do.
[3285.44 → 3286.08] So that's all
[3286.08 → 3287.44] for the LTT Store update.
[3288.08 → 3288.66] We can also,
[3288.74 → 3289.46] how long do you have
[3289.46 → 3290.04] with us, Luke?
[3290.76 → 3291.70] Do you need to get
[3291.70 → 3292.26] to your flight?
[3293.48 → 3294.88] Boarding has begun.
[3295.54 → 3296.08] Has it now?
[3296.18 → 3296.80] But it doesn't,
[3296.80 → 3299.00] it doesn't completely close
[3299.00 → 3302.24] for 29 minutes.
[3302.36 → 3303.30] I should probably leave
[3303.30 → 3304.44] in like 10 or 15.
[3304.48 → 3304.80] Okay,
[3304.82 → 3305.28] I'm going to blow
[3305.28 → 3306.48] through the sponsors then.
[3307.02 → 3307.46] Thanks,
[3307.60 → 3307.82] Brilliant,
[3308.02 → 3309.32] for sponsoring this video.
[3309.72 → 3310.86] Brilliant is a hands-on
[3310.86 → 3311.84] and interactive way
[3311.84 → 3313.12] to learn STEM topics.
[3313.28 → 3313.60] Actually,
[3313.76 → 3314.06] hold on.
[3314.12 → 3314.24] No,
[3314.32 → 3314.96] I'm going to talk
[3314.96 → 3315.88] about Brilliant in a minute.
[3316.44 → 3317.30] I saw the most
[3317.30 → 3318.82] infuriating thing
[3318.82 → 3320.06] on the package
[3320.06 → 3321.30] of a children's toy
[3321.30 → 3322.92] last weekend.
[3323.44 → 3324.66] My kids were working
[3324.66 → 3326.60] on this cute little project
[3326.60 → 3327.54] where they were making
[3327.54 → 3328.34] like flowers
[3328.34 → 3329.42] or something like that.
[3329.54 → 3330.38] And on the side
[3330.38 → 3331.04] of the box,
[3331.22 → 3332.06] it said,
[3332.42 → 3333.00] STEAM.
[3333.96 → 3334.92] STEAM learning
[3334.92 → 3336.14] or something like that.
[3336.38 → 3337.10] And they went,
[3337.28 → 3337.90] and I don't know
[3337.90 → 3338.70] why this bothered me
[3338.70 → 3339.18] so much,
[3339.42 → 3340.84] but instead of
[3340.84 → 3341.18] science,
[3341.30 → 3341.72] technology,
[3341.88 → 3342.16] engineering,
[3342.16 → 3342.84] and math,
[3342.96 → 3343.94] they added an A
[3343.94 → 3344.80] for art.
[3345.92 → 3346.82] That's the whole
[3346.82 → 3347.80] f***ING point
[3347.80 → 3349.06] is that if it's
[3349.06 → 3349.90] a STEM toy,
[3350.14 → 3351.82] it's not art.
[3352.20 → 3352.80] It's like
[3352.80 → 3354.74] the other thing.
[3356.18 → 3357.28] STEAM is just
[3357.28 → 3357.88] everything.
[3359.68 → 3360.98] It's like when you have
[3360.98 → 3362.20] like fricking
[3362.20 → 3363.56] gluten-free apple.
[3363.56 → 3364.24] like,
[3364.64 → 3365.20] yeah,
[3365.96 → 3367.38] yogurt with probiotic.
[3367.52 → 3367.96] I know.
[3368.72 → 3370.56] It's a STEAM toy.
[3371.50 → 3372.38] Alrighty then.
[3373.46 → 3374.36] What are you even
[3374.36 → 3375.20] talking about?
[3376.98 → 3377.90] Oh man,
[3378.04 → 3380.24] that's kind of sad.
[3381.08 → 3381.50] Yeah.
[3382.26 → 3382.82] Anyway,
[3383.00 → 3383.20] sorry,
[3383.28 → 3383.96] let's go back to Brilliant.
[3384.36 → 3385.64] Brilliant is a hands-on
[3385.64 → 3386.62] and interactive way
[3386.62 → 3388.06] to learn STEM topics.
[3388.36 → 3389.36] They offer thousands
[3389.36 → 3389.88] of courses
[3389.88 → 3390.56] with new topics
[3390.56 → 3391.58] to learn every month,
[3391.58 → 3392.62] like their computer science
[3392.62 → 3393.60] fundamentals course,
[3393.98 → 3395.20] which also includes
[3395.20 → 3395.70] a bit about
[3395.70 → 3396.30] how to draw
[3396.30 → 3397.40] in MS Paint
[3397.40 → 3398.34] because it's STEAM.
[3398.36 → 3398.46] No,
[3398.50 → 3398.76] I'm kidding.
[3398.86 → 3399.12] I'm kidding.
[3399.62 → 3401.02] That's a bit
[3401.02 → 3401.56] that you missed
[3401.56 → 3402.42] if you just tune in
[3402.42 → 3403.30] for the sponsor spots.
[3403.88 → 3404.48] Their services
[3404.48 → 3405.16] can be used
[3405.16 → 3405.60] to supplement
[3405.60 → 3406.54] a college education
[3406.54 → 3407.90] or you can use them
[3407.90 → 3408.76] if getting smart
[3408.76 → 3409.58] is just a passion
[3409.58 → 3410.00] of yours.
[3410.94 → 3411.58] If you work
[3411.58 → 3412.32] in the tech industry,
[3412.46 → 3413.16] you may have
[3413.16 → 3414.30] lost your job recently.
[3414.86 → 3415.48] Brilliant can be
[3415.48 → 3416.36] a great way
[3416.36 → 3417.26] to learn new skills.
[3417.34 → 3417.44] No,
[3417.50 → 3417.92] I'm serious.
[3418.08 → 3418.88] I'm serious right now.
[3419.20 → 3419.70] Brilliant can be
[3419.70 → 3420.32] a great way
[3420.32 → 3421.30] to learn new skills
[3421.30 → 3422.46] and make yourself
[3422.46 → 3423.50] the most employable
[3423.50 → 3424.44] person who applies,
[3424.56 → 3425.28] which is really
[3425.28 → 3426.24] the goal, right?
[3426.70 → 3427.42] If you don't understand
[3427.42 → 3428.60] the basics behind a problem,
[3428.96 → 3429.48] where do you even
[3429.48 → 3430.22] start troubleshooting?
[3430.48 → 3431.42] That's what Brilliant
[3431.42 → 3432.30] gives you, okay?
[3432.38 → 3433.46] The first 200 of you
[3433.46 → 3433.80] who head to
[3433.80 → 3434.36] brilliant.org
[3434.36 → 3434.94] slash WAN

[3435.66 → 3436.52] 20% off
[3436.52 → 3437.78] an annual premium subscription.
[3437.94 → 3438.04] Look,
[3438.08 → 3438.82] I know that's kind of
[3438.82 → 3439.90] a savage way to say it,
[3440.28 → 3441.16] but for real,
[3441.26 → 3442.38] that's what platforms
[3442.38 → 3442.88] like Brilliant
[3442.88 → 3443.72] are great at.

[3493.18 → 3493.72] by Squarespace.
[3494.52 → 3495.30] Running your own business

[3496.32 → 3497.18] There's certainly people
[3497.18 → 3497.68] who have shown
[3497.68 → 3498.96] that it can be very hard.
[3499.08 → 3499.80] They make it look hard.
[3500.12 → 3501.16] But making your website
[3501.16 → 3502.56] doesn't have to be hard.
[3502.94 → 3504.58] Squarespace is an all-in-one platform
[3504.58 → 3505.42] that makes it easy
[3505.42 → 3506.14] to get your website

[3544.66 → 3545.66] All right, Luke.
[3546.16 → 3547.48] What do you want to talk about?
[3547.80 → 3548.68] I think I got a couple
[3548.68 → 3549.60] little things in here.
[3549.72 → 3550.24] Ah, yes.
[3550.70 → 3551.44] Ash Ketchum.
[3551.44 → 3553.32] Finally won Pokémon.
[3553.64 → 3553.90] Yeah, what?
[3554.60 → 3555.38] I don't know.
[3555.64 → 3557.22] I don't know either.
[3557.56 → 3558.76] There's no link for this.
[3558.88 → 3559.72] What's even happening?
[3559.74 → 3561.06] There were tens of thousands
[3561.06 → 3561.90] of tweets, Luke.
[3562.16 → 3563.00] This was trending
[3563.00 → 3565.58] during my daily Twitter check-in
[3565.58 → 3566.88] on the dumpster fire.
[3567.62 → 3568.78] Ash Ketchum won it
[3568.78 → 3570.82] after 25 years.
[3570.96 → 3571.46] How do you even win Pokémon?
[3571.58 → 3572.60] There's all these different leagues
[3572.60 → 3573.04] and everything.
[3573.20 → 3573.44] I don't...
[3574.62 → 3575.18] League character
[3575.18 → 3576.86] has won the Pokémon
[3576.86 → 3578.08] World Championship.
[3578.08 → 3578.46] Okay.
[3580.70 → 3581.20] Oh, hold on.
[3581.28 → 3581.54] Some people...
[3581.54 → 3581.80] Hold on.
[3581.86 → 3582.82] Some people on float plane
[3582.82 → 3583.52] are upset
[3583.52 → 3585.32] about me, like,
[3585.54 → 3586.54] supposedly, like,
[3586.60 → 3587.48] being down on art
[3587.48 → 3587.86] or whatever.
[3588.02 → 3588.54] No, I'm not.
[3588.70 → 3589.66] Art is important.
[3590.28 → 3591.46] It's just that the entire
[3591.46 → 3593.48] point of calling something
[3593.48 → 3593.96] STEM
[3593.96 → 3595.88] was that it isn't that.
[3596.28 → 3596.94] It's science,
[3597.10 → 3597.52] technology,
[3597.68 → 3598.04] engineering,
[3598.04 → 3598.62] and math,
[3598.74 → 3599.70] disciplines that are all
[3599.70 → 3601.18] very closely related
[3601.18 → 3603.34] and in a very different silo
[3603.34 → 3604.24] from art.
[3604.66 → 3605.86] If it's an art thing,
[3606.30 → 3608.38] then it can be an art thing,
[3608.56 → 3609.88] and if it's a STEM thing,
[3609.96 → 3611.12] then it can be a STEM thing.
[3611.38 → 3612.64] Not everything has to be
[3612.64 → 3613.86] everything to everyone.
[3614.10 → 3615.08] That's my whole point.
[3615.24 → 3615.52] Yes.
[3615.80 → 3617.94] We absolutely do art projects
[3617.94 → 3618.74] with our kids.
[3619.20 → 3619.64] They're just...
[3619.64 → 3620.22] They're art.
[3621.04 → 3623.32] And we do STEM things,
[3623.40 → 3624.36] and they're different.
[3624.40 → 3625.50] And you can make them...
[3625.50 → 3626.32] You can relate them
[3626.32 → 3626.88] to each other,
[3626.88 → 3627.86] like Starry Night,
[3628.10 → 3630.42] the movement of the things
[3630.42 → 3631.18] in the paintings,
[3631.60 → 3631.96] whatever,
[3632.14 → 3632.88] based on something.
[3632.96 → 3633.22] I don't know.
[3633.24 → 3633.82] It's really cool.
[3633.94 → 3634.14] Sure.
[3634.44 → 3635.02] You can make them
[3635.02 → 3635.72] related to each other,
[3635.82 → 3638.24] but that's when you are
[3638.24 → 3639.74] taking two different disciplines
[3639.74 → 3640.40] that you've learned
[3640.40 → 3641.38] and you're bringing them together
[3641.38 → 3642.16] in a beautiful way.
[3642.32 → 3642.72] Yes.
[3642.72 → 3643.48] That's fine.
[3643.70 → 3644.02] Exactly.
[3644.02 → 3645.14] But it doesn't mean that...
[3645.14 → 3646.24] You didn't say art's bad.
[3646.48 → 3647.42] It's just not a part of STEM.
[3647.68 → 3648.00] Jeez.
[3648.00 → 3648.74] It's okay.
[3648.88 → 3650.12] Reminds me of my favourite
[3650.12 → 3651.42] tweet of all time.
[3655.24 → 3656.10] What is it?
[3656.10 → 3657.84] I'm trying to find it.
[3660.06 → 3661.18] Man, I'm trying to remember.
[3662.08 → 3662.54] Okay.
[3662.60 → 3663.60] What were we talking about before?
[3664.02 → 3664.28] Oh, yeah.
[3664.36 → 3664.98] Ash Ketchum.
[3666.00 → 3666.74] Ash Ketchum.
[3669.32 → 3669.62] Yeah.
[3669.72 → 3670.68] 25 years later,
[3670.76 → 3671.56] he wins the Pokémon
[3671.56 → 3672.36] World Championship.
[3674.54 → 3676.76] Maybe the burst of sales
[3676.76 → 3677.78] on Pokémon cards
[3677.78 → 3679.94] because of those people
[3679.94 → 3680.80] buying Charizard's
[3680.80 → 3681.96] and the whole world
[3681.96 → 3682.58] going nuts
[3682.58 → 3685.12] went on a decline
[3685.12 → 3685.70] so now they need
[3685.70 → 3686.50] to be back in the news.
[3686.58 → 3687.12] I have no idea.
[3687.50 → 3688.06] I don't know why
[3688.06 → 3688.74] this is a thing.
[3689.16 → 3690.10] I don't know why
[3690.10 → 3691.00] it wouldn't be either, though.
[3691.18 → 3691.44] I don't know.
[3691.44 → 3692.64] The people celebrating it
[3692.64 → 3694.02] is the thing that really
[3694.02 → 3695.60] was what I wanted to discuss
[3695.60 → 3696.92] because it reminded me
[3696.92 → 3698.00] of something that I was
[3698.00 → 3698.70] reading about
[3698.70 → 3699.74] on my last trip.
[3699.74 → 3700.50] I was just like
[3700.50 → 3701.48] kind of doom-scrolling
[3701.48 → 3702.98] and I came across
[3702.98 → 3704.68] some WWE news.
[3705.16 → 3706.74] Now, WWE is not something
[3706.74 → 3707.86] that I follow closely.
[3708.20 → 3709.02] I had a friend
[3709.02 → 3709.76] in high school
[3709.76 → 3711.68] who was super into
[3711.68 → 3712.88] WWF,
[3712.96 → 3713.48] would have been what
[3713.48 → 3714.40] it was called at the time,
[3714.78 → 3716.28] and so everything I know
[3716.28 → 3717.42] is from just
[3717.42 → 3719.80] absorbing through osmosis
[3719.80 → 3721.00] from Kenny
[3721.00 → 3722.08] from high school,
[3722.62 → 3724.46] but this was,
[3724.58 → 3724.98] this was,
[3725.10 → 3726.30] this piqued my interest
[3726.30 → 3727.20] and I did end up
[3727.20 → 3728.58] reading up on it
[3728.58 → 3729.06] a little bit.
[3729.50 → 3729.90] Basically,
[3729.90 → 3731.54] there was a lot of outrage
[3731.54 → 3733.60] over a recent smackdown
[3733.60 → 3734.22] or showdown
[3734.22 → 3735.22] or whatever it was
[3735.22 → 3737.92] because the
[3738.00 → 3738.98] like the big fight,
[3739.08 → 3740.24] the big title fight
[3740.24 → 3742.78] had a big problem,
[3742.90 → 3743.92] and that was that
[3743.92 → 3745.82] the guy who lost,
[3745.90 → 3746.58] his shoulders
[3746.58 → 3748.06] weren't on the mat
[3748.06 → 3749.52] for the full three seconds,
[3749.52 → 3751.30] so the win
[3751.30 → 3752.38] shouldn't have gone
[3752.38 → 3754.50] to the other guy,
[3755.18 → 3757.78] and I was kind of,
[3757.78 → 3758.66] I was kind of
[3758.66 → 3759.62] mind-boggled,
[3760.02 → 3760.30] right,
[3760.38 → 3761.94] because on the one hand,
[3762.00 → 3763.00] I can absolutely
[3763.00 → 3764.52] appreciate people
[3764.52 → 3765.80] enjoying WWE
[3765.80 → 3767.26] as a form of entertainment
[3767.26 → 3768.46] in the same way
[3768.46 → 3769.62] that you might enjoy
[3769.62 → 3770.60] watching Pokémon
[3770.60 → 3771.92] as a form of entertainment.
[3772.42 → 3772.94] Sure.
[3772.94 → 3773.82] What I absolutely
[3773.82 → 3775.80] cannot possibly fathom
[3775.80 → 3776.68] is being,
[3776.84 → 3777.78] I'm taking it super seriously.
[3777.78 → 3779.06] is being really excited
[3779.06 → 3780.56] over the triumph
[3780.56 → 3781.52] of this fictional
[3781.52 → 3782.56] cartoon character
[3782.56 → 3784.88] and or the victory
[3784.88 → 3787.04] that was robbed
[3787.04 → 3787.82] from this,
[3787.90 → 3789.62] from this actor
[3789.62 → 3790.56] playing a character
[3790.56 → 3791.36] in a
[3791.36 → 3793.20] in a fictional wrestling match
[3793.20 → 3794.48] when the result
[3794.48 → 3795.40] was predetermined
[3795.40 → 3796.32] in the first place,
[3796.32 → 3797.54] and my understanding
[3797.54 → 3799.88] is that most WWE viewers
[3799.88 → 3801.36] do know that it's
[3801.36 → 3802.94] scripted, right?
[3804.14 → 3804.38] Yeah.
[3804.78 → 3805.18] Okay.
[3805.38 → 3806.94] So then if you know that,
[3807.58 → 3808.62] then you know
[3808.62 → 3809.58] that it didn't matter
[3809.58 → 3810.30] that his shoulders
[3810.30 → 3811.04] weren't pinned
[3811.04 → 3811.90] for three seconds.
[3812.02 → 3812.52] That's like,
[3812.86 → 3814.12] it's like being upset.
[3814.34 → 3814.46] Like,
[3814.50 → 3815.48] you can poke fun
[3815.48 → 3815.98] at a
[3815.98 → 3816.78] at a botched,
[3817.22 → 3817.74] um,
[3817.78 → 3818.84] at a botched stunt
[3818.84 → 3819.42] in a movie,
[3819.68 → 3820.14] right?
[3820.30 → 3821.38] Or like the gaff tape
[3821.38 → 3821.88] on the back
[3821.88 → 3823.28] of the Stormtrooper's thigh
[3823.28 → 3824.00] in A New Hope
[3824.00 → 3824.44] or whatever,
[3824.56 → 3824.76] right?
[3825.30 → 3826.28] But you shouldn't be
[3826.28 → 3827.28] mad about it.
[3829.14 → 3830.06] All it was,
[3830.10 → 3830.84] was the stunt
[3830.84 → 3831.54] where he was supposed
[3831.54 → 3832.14] to have his,
[3832.26 → 3832.48] like,
[3833.06 → 3833.78] supposed to have
[3833.78 → 3834.78] his shoulders down,
[3835.10 → 3835.62] they, like,
[3836.18 → 3836.78] screwed it up
[3836.78 → 3837.38] a little bit,
[3837.84 → 3838.22] you know?
[3838.66 → 3839.10] Like,
[3839.16 → 3840.02] they botched
[3840.02 → 3841.12] the choreography.
[3841.70 → 3842.36] Oh, no.
[3842.68 → 3843.44] Poor Twitch.
[3843.54 → 3844.26] They're all upset
[3844.26 → 3845.78] that WWE is fake.
[3846.48 → 3846.76] Yeah.
[3847.86 → 3848.26] Uh,
[3848.60 → 3851.08] that doesn't surprise me
[3851.08 → 3851.64] that you guys
[3851.64 → 3851.90] weren't,
[3851.98 → 3852.52] wouldn't know.
[3853.40 → 3853.88] I love you,
[3853.92 → 3854.14] Twitch.
[3854.30 → 3854.84] I love you,
[3854.88 → 3855.14] Twitch.
[3855.66 → 3856.36] It's like,
[3856.76 → 3860.28] you're my,
[3860.40 → 3861.00] you're my favourite
[3861.00 → 3861.76] kid in the class.
[3862.30 → 3863.20] Even if you catch
[3863.20 → 3863.90] on a little slow.
[3864.30 → 3864.70] Oh,
[3864.78 → 3865.36] they're calling you
[3865.36 → 3865.70] to the gate.
[3865.92 → 3866.32] I'm,
[3866.40 → 3868.52] I'm going to say goodbye.
[3868.52 → 3870.80] Bye,
[3870.94 → 3871.32] everyone.
[3872.36 → 3872.56] Uh,
[3872.70 → 3873.60] fan standard,
[3873.68 → 3873.96] hold on,
[3874.02 → 3874.88] fan standard on
[3874.88 → 3875.30] float plane,
[3875.34 → 3875.82] this is amazing.
[3876.16 → 3877.24] This is a bad take,
[3877.28 → 3877.80] to be honest.
[3877.90 → 3878.62] Just because there's
[3878.62 → 3879.34] a script doesn't
[3879.34 → 3879.92] mean the rules
[3879.92 → 3880.52] don't apply.
[3881.36 → 3881.76] Yes,
[3881.78 → 3882.44] it does.
[3883.88 → 3885.04] It means the rules
[3885.04 → 3885.50] are whatever
[3885.50 → 3886.70] they decide they are.
[3890.86 → 3891.22] Oh,
[3891.32 → 3891.48] no.
[3891.48 → 3891.66] Oh,
[3891.66 → 3892.18] that's beautiful.
[3892.76 → 3893.12] Okay,
[3893.26 → 3893.68] I have to go,
[3893.76 → 3893.84] though.
[3893.90 → 3894.24] All right,
[3894.26 → 3894.96] I'll let you go.
[3895.18 → 3895.84] I'll let you go.
[3896.30 → 3896.68] I don't know,
[3896.78 → 3896.98] Bell.
[3896.98 → 3897.22] Bye,
[3897.36 → 3897.86] have a good rest
[3897.86 → 3898.26] of the show.
[3898.64 → 3899.04] All right,
[3899.14 → 3899.80] safe travels.
[3901.04 → 3901.22] Yeah,
[3901.26 → 3901.58] join them,
[3901.66 → 3901.72] Bell.
[3901.86 → 3902.02] Go,
[3902.08 → 3902.18] go.
[3902.52 → 3902.76] Bye.
[3903.12 → 3903.46] Bell,
[3903.52 → 3903.76] do you want
[3903.76 → 3904.26] to just jump
[3904.26 → 3904.82] over here,
[3904.94 → 3905.42] or are there
[3905.42 → 3906.00] things you need
[3906.00 → 3906.70] to do from over
[3906.70 → 3906.98] there?
[3907.18 → 3907.82] We could just,
[3907.88 → 3908.48] we could just put
[3908.48 → 3909.50] the producer came up.
[3910.04 → 3910.30] Yeah,
[3910.38 → 3910.94] we can just hang
[3910.94 → 3911.72] out with producer cam.
[3911.90 → 3912.16] Boom,
[3912.22 → 3912.48] all right,
[3912.52 → 3912.96] do you want to just
[3912.96 → 3913.88] throw producer cam
[3913.88 → 3914.34] over there,
[3914.42 → 3914.84] and we'll just
[3914.84 → 3915.48] co-host the show
[3915.48 → 3916.28] together for the rest?
[3916.36 → 3916.84] I would love to.
[3917.00 → 3917.36] All right,
[3917.42 → 3917.60] cool,
[3917.66 → 3918.36] that sounds good.
[3918.66 → 3919.22] There's a couple
[3919.22 → 3920.28] other big news topics
[3920.28 → 3921.02] for the week.
[3921.86 → 3923.42] The founder of Oculus,
[3923.42 → 3923.82] actually,
[3923.88 → 3924.32] I would have loved
[3924.32 → 3925.06] to talk to Luke
[3925.06 → 3925.50] about this,
[3925.56 → 3926.02] but you'll do.
[3926.54 → 3927.86] The founder of Oculus,
[3928.06 → 3928.74] Palmer Lucky.
[3929.24 → 3929.46] Wow,
[3929.48 → 3930.10] you've got that lined
[3930.10 → 3930.74] up pretty good.
[3930.94 → 3931.76] I like that.
[3931.90 → 3932.12] First try.
[3932.32 → 3933.14] That looks great.
[3935.78 → 3937.26] Created a lethal
[3937.26 → 3938.28] VR headset,
[3938.52 → 3939.34] where if you die
[3939.34 → 3940.08] in the game,
[3940.24 → 3941.84] you die in real life.
[3941.94 → 3942.18] Now,
[3942.70 → 3943.72] this is a very
[3943.72 → 3944.80] misleading headline,
[3945.00 → 3945.60] but we're not the
[3945.60 → 3946.68] ones responsible for
[3946.68 → 3947.44] the misleading ness
[3947.44 → 3948.04] of the headline.
[3948.58 → 3948.70] We are,
[3948.70 → 3949.08] we are,
[3949.20 → 3950.46] I actually clicked
[3950.46 → 3951.04] on a headline
[3951.04 → 3952.48] that was that clickbait.
[3952.48 → 3953.16] He made a headset
[3953.16 → 3954.02] that makes you die,
[3954.18 → 3954.90] but actually,
[3955.04 → 3956.14] it was more of a
[3956.20 → 3957.00] supposed to be like
[3957.00 → 3957.98] a thought-provoking
[3957.98 → 3958.90] art piece
[3958.90 → 3959.98] than an actual
[3959.98 → 3961.22] functional headset.
[3961.82 → 3962.70] We've got a
[3962.84 → 3964.00] we should have a good
[3964.00 → 3965.08] shot of it here
[3965.08 → 3966.24] in the LTT forum.
[3966.72 → 3967.44] This was posted
[3967.44 → 3968.52] by Dragon Winged.
[3968.56 → 3969.64] Thank you very much.
[3970.12 → 3971.32] Source Daily Wire
[3971.32 → 3972.56] gets us a picture
[3972.56 → 3973.22] of the headset,
[3973.42 → 3973.92] I hope.
[3974.52 → 3974.78] Hello,
[3974.92 → 3975.18] headset.
[3976.56 → 3977.04] Sure.
[3977.30 → 3978.06] It's on Twitter.
[3978.62 → 3978.84] Hey,
[3978.92 → 3979.12] everybody.
[3979.20 → 3979.72] There it is.
[3980.32 → 3980.76] All right.
[3980.76 → 3982.00] So basically,
[3982.32 → 3983.20] it's either like
[3983.20 → 3984.20] explosive charges
[3984.20 → 3985.24] or bullets or something.
[3985.34 → 3985.96] I don't remember,
[3986.10 → 3986.76] but pretty much
[3986.76 → 3988.50] if you die in game,
[3989.52 → 3990.96] it blasts out
[3990.96 → 3991.66] your brain.
[3993.56 → 3994.62] And it was meant
[3994.62 → 3995.30] to sort of
[3995.30 → 3996.62] provoke discussion
[3996.62 → 3998.66] around the types
[3998.66 → 3999.20] of,
[3999.20 → 4002.34] types of VR
[4002.34 → 4003.04] experiences
[4003.04 → 4004.34] that we have now
[4004.34 → 4005.50] compared to the
[4005.50 → 4006.20] types of VR
[4006.20 → 4007.24] experiences that
[4007.24 → 4008.22] might exist in the
[4008.22 → 4008.50] future.
[4008.64 → 4009.24] So here's what he
[4009.24 → 4009.50] says.
[4009.50 → 4010.64] You instantly
[4010.64 → 4011.48] raise the stakes
[4011.48 → 4012.18] to the maximum
[4012.18 → 4013.12] level and force
[4013.12 → 4014.12] people to fundamentally
[4014.12 → 4015.10] rethink how they
[4015.10 → 4015.86] interact with the
[4015.86 → 4016.62] virtual world and
[4016.62 → 4017.40] the players inside
[4017.40 → 4017.62] it.
[4018.12 → 4019.08] Pumped up graphics
[4019.08 → 4019.86] might make a game
[4019.86 → 4020.74] look more real,
[4020.92 → 4021.72] but only the threat
[4021.72 → 4022.82] of serious consequences
[4022.82 → 4023.56] can make a game
[4023.56 → 4024.60] feel real to you
[4024.60 → 4025.24] and every other
[4025.24 → 4026.38] person in the game.
[4026.88 → 4027.92] The device pays
[4027.92 → 4029.06] homage to Nerve
[4029.06 → 4030.06] Gear, a helmet
[4030.06 → 4030.92] worn by a fictional
[4030.92 → 4032.34] killer in the VR
[4032.34 → 4033.10] themed manga
[4033.10 → 4034.20] Sword Art Online.
[4034.20 → 4034.44] mine.
[4035.46 → 4037.48] I thought it was
[4037.48 → 4038.56] actually, you know,
[4038.60 → 4039.30] in spite of the
[4039.30 → 4040.38] clickbait nonsense
[4040.38 → 4041.90] articles, he said he
[4041.90 → 4043.48] has plans for an
[4043.48 → 4044.58] anti-tamper mechanism
[4044.58 → 4045.22] that will make it
[4045.22 → 4046.06] impossible to remove
[4046.06 → 4046.62] or destroy the
[4046.62 → 4046.88] headset.
[4047.62 → 4048.20] There are also
[4048.20 → 4049.10] potentially bugs that
[4049.10 → 4049.74] could kill someone at
[4049.74 → 4050.46] the wrong time, so it
[4050.46 → 4051.06] hasn't been properly
[4051.06 → 4053.70] tested, but he
[4053.70 → 4054.64] doesn't intend to ever
[4054.64 → 4056.04] actually make it.
[4056.08 → 4056.42] And they are
[4056.42 → 4057.16] explosive charge
[4057.16 → 4057.56] modules.
[4057.66 → 4058.08] There you go.
[4058.88 → 4059.72] I think it's
[4059.72 → 4060.48] actually a really
[4060.48 → 4061.46] interesting conversation
[4061.46 → 4062.98] because, Bella, you
[4062.98 → 4063.62] ever play paintball?
[4064.10 → 4064.36] Yeah.
[4064.88 → 4065.56] It's one of the
[4065.56 → 4066.78] things that I like
[4066.78 → 4068.30] and that I enjoyed
[4068.30 → 4070.18] most about paintball
[4070.18 → 4071.48] is when you've got
[4071.48 → 4073.38] the actual, and
[4073.38 → 4074.60] honestly, the way
[4074.60 → 4075.48] that I would always
[4075.48 → 4076.70] play is without
[4076.70 → 4077.04] armour.
[4077.46 → 4078.80] I would play in a
[4078.80 → 4080.38] t-shirt and thin
[4080.38 → 4081.56] pants just so that I'm
[4081.56 → 4082.64] not like scuffing my
[4082.64 → 4083.44] knees while I'm,
[4083.44 → 4084.18] you know, kneeling
[4084.18 → 4085.96] around in the grass or
[4085.96 → 4086.94] sticks or mud or
[4086.94 → 4087.24] whatever.
[4087.24 → 4088.14] But I would
[4088.14 → 4089.54] intentionally actually
[4089.54 → 4090.58] wear very light
[4090.58 → 4091.06] clothing.
[4091.44 → 4092.60] Helmet, obviously, and
[4092.60 → 4093.60] I did play with gloves
[4093.60 → 4094.52] because getting hit,
[4094.82 → 4096.18] like, man, I had,
[4096.28 → 4097.12] like, one of my
[4097.12 → 4098.08] knuckles half, like,
[4098.18 → 4099.26] ripped off once by a
[4099.26 → 4099.52] paintball.
[4099.56 → 4100.44] It was very unpleasant.
[4101.02 → 4102.22] But I would play in as
[4102.22 → 4103.26] light gear as possible
[4103.26 → 4104.56] because, from my
[4104.56 → 4106.08] point of view, the
[4106.08 → 4108.68] entire reason that
[4108.68 → 4110.36] paintball hurts is
[4110.36 → 4111.44] because it changes the
[4111.44 → 4112.40] gameplay dynamic.
[4112.96 → 4114.00] If I wanted to play
[4114.00 → 4115.20] video games where
[4115.20 → 4115.56] there's no
[4115.56 → 4116.98] consequences, I
[4116.98 → 4117.60] would play video
[4117.60 → 4117.96] games.
[4117.96 → 4119.12] If I wanted to just
[4119.12 → 4120.40] run around and
[4120.40 → 4121.98] meme, well, I could
[4121.98 → 4122.86] play laser tag.
[4123.12 → 4124.20] But what's great about
[4124.20 → 4125.36] paintball is it
[4125.36 → 4127.64] f***ING hurts, right?
[4127.90 → 4130.26] And so the risk and
[4130.26 → 4131.78] the reward are both
[4131.78 → 4134.00] elevated so much
[4134.00 → 4134.82] compared to other
[4134.82 → 4135.14] games.
[4135.28 → 4136.48] Like, man, you ever,
[4136.54 → 4138.42] like, get around
[4138.42 → 4139.94] behind enemy lines and,
[4140.14 → 4141.70] like, you know, manage
[4141.70 → 4142.86] to get within range, like,
[4142.92 → 4144.02] pop a couple of people from,
[4144.02 → 4145.32] like, 15 feet away?
[4145.80 → 4146.42] No, I'm bad.
[4146.86 → 4147.12] Oh.
[4147.34 → 4148.42] Yeah, no, I'm
[4148.42 → 4149.14] immediately out.
[4149.48 → 4149.76] Oh.
[4150.22 → 4150.72] All right.
[4150.78 → 4151.78] Well, I was pretty good
[4151.78 → 4152.18] at it.
[4153.30 → 4154.82] And that was, that was,
[4154.82 → 4156.32] like, absolutely my
[4156.32 → 4156.98] favourite thing.
[4157.04 → 4158.20] I loved to flank.
[4158.88 → 4161.36] And, uh, I believe
[4161.36 → 4162.64] that's called masochism.
[4163.00 → 4164.18] No, because it, like,
[4164.24 → 4165.62] it's, it's, okay.
[4167.48 → 4168.48] That's not the point.
[4168.58 → 4169.28] I don't, I don't
[4169.28 → 4170.74] actually enjoy the pain
[4170.74 → 4171.72] and I don't enjoy
[4171.72 → 4173.40] inflicting pain, but I
[4173.40 → 4175.52] enjoy playing a game
[4175.52 → 4176.98] with real consequences
[4176.98 → 4177.90] because it totally
[4177.90 → 4178.70] changes people's
[4178.70 → 4179.06] behaviour.
[4179.34 → 4180.42] You don't just have
[4180.42 → 4182.16] people, like, running
[4182.16 → 4183.46] into, running into
[4183.46 → 4185.46] fire, Leroy Jenkins!
[4186.34 → 4187.22] Like, you don't deal
[4187.22 → 4187.72] with that.
[4188.02 → 4188.88] People are actually
[4188.88 → 4190.00] trying to play smart.
[4190.54 → 4192.04] And it's so much more
[4192.04 → 4193.86] satisfying to outplay
[4193.86 → 4195.44] smart someone than it
[4195.44 → 4196.72] is to, you just have
[4196.72 → 4197.42] the other team be
[4197.42 → 4198.32] Memling and, like,
[4198.64 → 4200.50] you're just, like,
[4200.54 → 4201.12] pelting them with
[4201.12 → 4201.68] little pieces of
[4201.68 → 4202.44] plastic or whatever.
[4203.58 → 4206.86] Um, that's not
[4206.86 → 4207.60] sadism.
[4207.72 → 4208.28] My goodness.
[4208.42 → 4209.66] I think you guys are,
[4209.78 → 4211.48] I think you guys are
[4211.48 → 4212.76] trying to turn this
[4212.76 → 4213.50] into something that
[4213.50 → 4214.10] it's not.
[4214.52 → 4215.66] I'm just saying,
[4215.72 → 4216.86] it's more fun with
[4216.86 → 4217.84] real consequences.
[4218.08 → 4218.86] That's all.
[4219.78 → 4220.22] Man.
[4222.98 → 4223.42] Okay.
[4224.24 → 4225.04] You need skin in the
[4225.04 → 4225.74] game to take it
[4225.74 → 4226.72] seriously and that's
[4226.72 → 4227.06] more fun.
[4227.06 → 4227.38] Yes.
[4227.50 → 4228.02] The bit man.
[4228.14 → 4229.14] That's exactly what
[4229.14 → 4229.88] I'm trying to say.
[4230.60 → 4231.42] Exactly what I'm
[4231.42 → 4232.08] trying to say.
[4235.32 → 4236.18] See, the headset's
[4236.18 → 4236.90] just cool because
[4236.90 → 4238.00] Sword Art Online is
[4238.00 → 4238.30] cool.
[4238.44 → 4239.02] Like, you want to
[4239.02 → 4240.36] have that risk just
[4240.36 → 4241.06] because your favourite
[4241.06 → 4242.18] anime character did,
[4242.24 → 4242.54] you know?
[4243.06 → 4244.06] Dark 24 says that
[4244.06 → 4245.12] makes it not a game.
[4245.24 → 4245.80] The point is that
[4245.80 → 4246.86] there are no IRL
[4246.86 → 4247.46] consequences.
[4247.46 → 4248.48] That's not true at
[4248.48 → 4248.94] all.
[4249.14 → 4250.40] The world is full of
[4250.40 → 4251.66] games with in real
[4251.66 → 4252.54] life consequences.
[4253.02 → 4254.06] Like, like, prizes,
[4254.06 → 4255.68] money and, like,
[4255.82 → 4256.48] injuries and
[4256.48 → 4257.50] professional sports.
[4257.88 → 4258.88] Like, no, the world
[4258.88 → 4260.70] is full of games that
[4260.70 → 4261.48] have real world
[4261.48 → 4262.16] consequences.
[4263.18 → 4263.58] Absolutely.
[4266.06 → 4267.06] Hydrox777 says a lot
[4267.06 → 4267.66] of people who aren't
[4267.66 → 4268.38] athletes might not
[4268.38 → 4268.98] understand this.
[4269.28 → 4270.06] I think it's just a
[4270.06 → 4270.88] competitive mindset.
[4271.62 → 4272.62] Like, it's no secret
[4272.62 → 4273.96] that I am a hyper,
[4274.14 → 4275.00] hyper-competitive
[4275.00 → 4275.54] person.
[4275.88 → 4276.86] It's not something that
[4276.86 → 4277.94] I do on purpose, but
[4277.94 → 4278.90] no matter what I'm
[4278.90 → 4279.22] doing.
[4279.70 → 4280.70] Luke made an offhand
[4280.70 → 4281.60] comment to me years
[4281.60 → 4281.78] ago.
[4281.86 → 4283.46] He goes, like, man, I
[4283.46 → 4284.18] don't think I've ever
[4284.18 → 4285.08] seen anything that
[4285.08 → 4285.54] you're not, like,
[4285.60 → 4286.52] halfway decent at.
[4286.96 → 4287.92] And it's because I try,
[4288.00 → 4289.10] like, freaking hard.
[4289.52 → 4290.48] Like, if I'm going to
[4290.48 → 4291.74] do anything, I'm going to
[4291.74 → 4292.64] do it as hard as I
[4292.64 → 4293.48] possibly can.
[4294.02 → 4295.42] And so, like, I try to
[4295.42 → 4296.22] improve really fast.
[4296.28 → 4297.08] I hate losing.
[4297.68 → 4298.42] And that's not to say
[4298.42 → 4299.28] that I'll never put
[4299.28 → 4300.44] myself in a position to
[4300.44 → 4300.84] lose.
[4301.30 → 4302.44] Losing can be fun.
[4303.04 → 4304.44] But I love to compete.
[4304.98 → 4306.12] And especially love to
[4306.12 → 4306.34] win.
[4306.34 → 4309.08] So, yeah, I don't
[4309.08 → 4309.18] know.
[4309.22 → 4311.18] Maybe it's just a...
[4311.18 → 4311.82] Fine.
[4312.32 → 4312.64] Fine.
[4312.70 → 4315.22] Maybe it's just a thing
[4315.22 → 4316.50] that people can't relate
[4316.50 → 4316.70] to.
[4316.80 → 4318.30] So I guess we can move
[4318.30 → 4318.54] on.
[4318.84 → 4319.44] What else do you want to
[4319.44 → 4319.80] talk about?
[4319.86 → 4320.48] Should we talk about the
[4320.48 → 4321.48] G Cloud review sample?
[4321.58 → 4322.04] Why don't you give me
[4322.04 → 4322.82] your take on it?
[4322.86 → 4323.64] Have you seen the G
[4323.64 → 4323.90] Cloud?
[4324.56 → 4324.92] Yes.
[4325.24 → 4327.48] So it's interesting.
[4327.98 → 4329.60] I probably, if this had
[4329.60 → 4330.68] been announced when the
[4330.68 → 4331.30] Steam Deck was really
[4331.30 → 4332.32] early, I'd actually
[4332.32 → 4333.30] probably be supporting
[4333.30 → 4334.02] of it more.
[4334.16 → 4334.92] You're new here, so I
[4334.92 → 4335.66] got to forgive you.
[4335.66 → 4336.48] For the people, you
[4336.48 → 4337.50] got to recap for the
[4337.50 → 4338.28] people who don't know
[4338.28 → 4339.28] what the G Cloud is a
[4339.28 → 4340.14] little bit before you
[4340.14 → 4340.72] give your take.
[4340.74 → 4341.20] I'm actually shocked
[4341.20 → 4341.74] people don't know what
[4341.74 → 4342.36] the G Cloud is.
[4342.40 → 4343.54] It's changing the tech
[4343.54 → 4343.76] world.
[4343.88 → 4345.08] It is taking over by
[4345.08 → 4345.52] storm.
[4346.08 → 4346.92] So on the screen there,
[4347.12 → 4348.40] the G Cloud is a
[4348.40 → 4349.52] handheld device like the
[4349.52 → 4350.76] Steam Deck, but it only
[4350.76 → 4353.36] does cloud-based, like
[4353.36 → 4354.22] streaming platforms like
[4354.22 → 4356.36] GeForce or, I don't
[4356.36 → 4357.24] know if it does Game
[4357.24 → 4358.36] Pass or whatever else, or
[4358.36 → 4359.30] if it's literally just
[4359.30 → 4360.34] Yeah, Xbox Game Pass
[4360.34 → 4361.18] and GeForce Now.
[4361.44 → 4361.98] So you have to be
[4361.98 → 4362.34] connected to the
[4362.34 → 4363.14] internet at all times, so
[4363.14 → 4363.66] like why be
[4363.66 → 4364.00] handheld?
[4364.00 → 4365.50] But the Steam Deck in its
[4365.50 → 4366.90] early days, the offline
[4366.90 → 4367.52] mode sucked.
[4367.90 → 4369.16] So I'd go to use it and
[4369.16 → 4370.00] games just wouldn't work
[4370.00 → 4370.64] because they required
[4370.64 → 4371.86] updates or whatever like
[4371.86 → 4372.48] that, and it would just be
[4372.48 → 4372.74] bricked.
[4372.94 → 4374.00] But now the Steam Deck is
[4374.00 → 4375.74] great and the Aya Neo's are
[4375.74 → 4376.62] great.
[4376.74 → 4377.24] But expensive.
[4377.90 → 4378.24] Yes.
[4378.46 → 4379.52] So why would you get
[4379.52 → 4380.30] something if you have to
[4380.30 → 4380.92] be around all the time?
[4380.96 → 4381.48] You could just use your
[4381.48 → 4381.72] phone.
[4382.20 → 4384.70] Just buy a $50 Racer
[4384.70 → 4386.24] Karachi, I can't remember
[4386.24 → 4386.74] with the handheld.
[4386.74 → 4390.28] And then you have your
[4390.28 → 4391.46] 5G connection anyway
[4391.46 → 4393.18] instead of hot spotting to
[4393.18 → 4393.84] use this.
[4393.90 → 4395.94] Or you're just at home and
[4395.94 → 4397.08] Samsung TVs have Game
[4397.08 → 4398.64] Pass and GeForce Now
[4398.64 → 4399.34] built in anyway.
[4400.06 → 4402.24] So who is this for?
[4403.08 → 4404.20] They've waited too long.
[4404.98 → 4405.38] Yeah.
[4407.88 → 4408.44] Okay.
[4409.08 → 4410.64] So here's what happened.
[4411.64 → 4414.14] Logitech reached out about
[4414.14 → 4415.84] potentially working together
[4415.84 → 4419.74] to do like some sponsorships
[4419.74 → 4421.20] or some advertising with us
[4421.20 → 4422.26] around this product.
[4422.96 → 4425.44] And rightfully, they expressed
[4425.44 → 4428.80] some concern that I hate it
[4428.80 → 4431.08] and therefore would not be
[4431.08 → 4433.72] willing and or able to talk
[4433.72 → 4435.40] about its benefits fairly.
[4436.10 → 4439.20] I think that's a smart thing
[4439.20 → 4440.90] for Logitech to be concerned
[4440.90 → 4441.20] about.
[4441.62 → 4443.74] But I actually think that they
[4443.74 → 4445.14] might have gotten the wrong
[4445.14 → 4447.04] idea from the previous times
[4447.04 → 4447.94] that I've talked about it.
[4448.38 → 4452.10] I don't hate cloud or
[4452.10 → 4454.38] like network-based gaming
[4454.38 → 4455.36] at all.
[4455.70 → 4457.48] In fact, if you go back far
[4457.48 → 4459.34] enough, was there anyone,
[4459.54 → 4461.72] and I mean anyone, on the face
[4461.72 → 4463.94] of the entire earth who beat
[4463.94 → 4466.06] the drum harder for Steam
[4466.06 → 4466.90] and home streaming?
[4467.88 → 4469.62] Man, I forget what NVIDIA even
[4469.62 → 4470.36] used to call it.
[4470.42 → 4472.20] But the original NVIDIA Shield,
[4472.20 → 4475.36] which was a mobile processor,
[4475.56 → 4476.38] Android device,
[4476.74 → 4478.46] predominantly designed for
[4478.46 → 4479.92] streaming PC games
[4479.92 → 4481.94] to your mobile.
[4482.50 → 4484.40] Was there anyone who beat
[4484.40 → 4485.54] the drum harder for that
[4485.54 → 4486.96] technology than I did?
[4487.66 → 4489.08] I don't think so.
[4489.60 → 4491.20] I'm super into it.
[4491.46 → 4492.50] It's super cool.
[4492.62 → 4493.84] It's amazing technology.
[4494.20 → 4495.12] Was it remote play?
[4495.84 → 4496.56] I know, yeah, I don't know.
[4496.56 → 4497.70] They call it Grid or something
[4497.70 → 4499.08] like that at some point.
[4501.38 → 4502.28] No, no, Moon shadow.
[4502.54 → 4503.46] People are trying to remember
[4503.46 → 4503.98] what it was called.
[4504.06 → 4504.92] Yeah, Moon shadow was a
[4504.92 → 4505.36] different thing.
[4505.42 → 4506.34] That was like a third-party
[4506.34 → 4507.24] app that used the same
[4507.24 → 4508.44] NVIDIA encoder, but it
[4508.44 → 4509.54] wasn't like the first-party
[4509.54 → 4510.94] one that ran on the NVIDIA
[4510.94 → 4511.82] Shield specifically.
[4513.56 → 4515.56] For me, the main concern
[4515.56 → 4517.82] with the G Cloud is that it's
[4517.82 → 4519.56] up against a competing device
[4519.56 → 4521.60] that can also be used for
[4521.60 → 4524.62] remote play, but that has a
[4524.62 → 4526.18] powerful PC inside it.
[4526.36 → 4528.50] However, there are still ways
[4528.50 → 4529.48] that the G Cloud could
[4529.48 → 4532.00] justify itself, and some of
[4532.00 → 4533.04] them I've talked about before,
[4533.18 → 4534.20] but some of them I haven't.
[4534.80 → 4536.34] GeForce Now Gaming, apparently,
[4536.84 → 4537.50] or Game Stream.
[4537.60 → 4538.74] No, Game Stream seems.
[4538.96 → 4539.80] I think it's Game Stream.
[4540.30 → 4541.86] Anyway, anyway, the point is
[4541.86 → 4543.02] some of the ways that it
[4543.02 → 4544.00] could justify itself I've
[4544.00 → 4544.74] talked about before.
[4545.02 → 4546.96] If, for example, the controls,
[4547.08 → 4548.30] like if the ergonomics of it
[4548.30 → 4549.42] are significantly better than
[4549.42 → 4551.02] the Steam Deck, I could see
[4551.02 → 4552.18] that being a reason to have
[4552.18 → 4552.66] one of these.
[4552.66 → 4554.40] games, and they wouldn't
[4554.40 → 4556.36] even need to be amazing to
[4556.36 → 4557.20] be better than the Steam Deck.
[4557.28 → 4558.22] Steam Deck's heavy, man.
[4559.16 → 4559.60] It's heavy.
[4561.10 → 4562.22] Another way it could justify
[4562.22 → 4563.40] itself is great battery life.
[4563.78 → 4564.82] I haven't seen the battery
[4564.82 → 4565.20] life.
[4565.36 → 4566.46] I don't know what the battery
[4566.46 → 4568.50] life is of the G Cloud, but
[4568.50 → 4571.02] the Steam Deck, around a
[4571.02 → 4572.16] couple of hours, if you're
[4572.16 → 4573.26] actually playing games locally
[4573.26 → 4574.58] on the device, and you might
[4574.58 → 4575.42] get, what, three and a half
[4575.42 → 4575.86] or four?
[4576.10 → 4577.04] Yeah, it's not strong.
[4577.22 → 4578.36] Yeah, it's not great.
[4578.66 → 4579.48] So that's one of the
[4579.48 → 4581.00] drawbacks of having a powerful
[4581.00 → 4582.82] PC in your handheld, instead
[4582.82 → 4584.30] of using mobile hardware in
[4584.30 → 4584.70] a handheld.
[4587.46 → 4588.28] Okay, that's it.
[4589.58 → 4590.44] Pricing, it could also
[4590.44 → 4591.88] justify itself, so we'd have
[4591.88 → 4593.08] to see what kind of pricing
[4593.08 → 4594.72] Logitech is planning in the
[4594.72 → 4595.00] future.
[4596.20 → 4598.14] So I guess what I'm saying
[4598.14 → 4601.30] is, one is coming, and I'm
[4601.30 → 4602.22] going to get a chance to try
[4602.22 → 4603.72] it in person, and basically
[4603.72 → 4605.18] we'll decide how to proceed
[4605.18 → 4605.92] from there.
[4610.32 → 4611.64] But as a happy Steam Deck
[4611.64 → 4612.92] customer, would you consider
[4612.92 → 4613.40] the G Cloud?
[4614.00 → 4615.22] No, I love my Steam Deck.
[4615.70 → 4617.60] I don't like the battery life,
[4617.66 → 4618.50] like we've done a little travel
[4618.50 → 4620.42] projects, and having to stop
[4620.42 → 4621.94] playing, you know, the first
[4621.94 → 4623.38] third of a flight, or plug it
[4623.38 → 4624.56] in, really sucked.
[4624.76 → 4626.44] But it is truly, like,
[4626.50 → 4626.88] amazing.
[4627.12 → 4628.42] I'm playing Fallout 4 with
[4628.42 → 4630.08] mods, and it looks great and
[4630.08 → 4630.68] runs smoothly.
[4630.84 → 4633.12] Like, I can't give that up to
[4633.12 → 4634.50] go on airplane Wi-Fi and
[4634.50 → 4635.66] stream via GeForce, hoping
[4635.66 → 4636.56] that it works well.
[4636.88 → 4637.80] I'd rather just carry around
[4637.80 → 4638.96] a battery pack or wait for
[4638.96 → 4641.26] Gen 2, or, you know, I feel
[4641.26 → 4642.30] like Steam would even, or
[4642.30 → 4643.42] Valve would even release just
[4643.42 → 4644.98] upgrade kits for your Steam
[4644.98 → 4645.20] Deck.
[4645.32 → 4646.54] So I feel like that is the
[4646.54 → 4648.42] more solid investment at this
[4648.42 → 4649.86] point, especially at its
[4649.86 → 4650.24] price point.
[4650.32 → 4651.38] It seems like a no-brainer.
[4653.00 → 4655.08] The DeviantArt reminds us
[4655.08 → 4656.52] that great artists steal.
[4657.14 → 4658.50] This particular topic was
[4658.50 → 4659.84] provided by Jonathan Horst.
[4660.76 → 4663.10] They tweeted the release,
[4663.12 → 4665.82] of, man, this is kind of
[4665.82 → 4667.92] wild, their new AI tools and
[4667.92 → 4668.66] controls.
[4669.72 → 4671.58] Dream Up, a new tool to
[4671.58 → 4672.56] generate art.
[4673.42 → 4674.82] Control the amount of AI art
[4674.82 → 4676.02] in your feed, clear labelling
[4676.02 → 4677.20] of art that's AI generated,
[4677.72 → 4679.80] directive to opt out of AI
[4679.80 → 4681.32] datasets, and the ability to
[4681.32 → 4682.12] opt out of prompts.
[4682.22 → 4684.98] So pretty much their plan for
[4684.98 → 4687.46] how to address AI art going
[4687.46 → 4688.06] forward.
[4689.08 → 4690.98] There's a man, wow, okay.
[4690.98 → 4693.30] So you can output computer
[4693.30 → 4694.32] generated images from a
[4694.32 → 4695.32] detailed prompt using the
[4695.32 → 4696.38] Stable Diffusion model.
[4696.92 → 4698.34] And DeviantArt account holders
[4698.34 → 4699.64] will get five free prompts with
[4699.64 → 4701.16] more included in the site's core
[4701.16 → 4702.10] subscription plan.
[4702.48 → 4703.60] They've got a gallery of
[4703.60 → 4705.10] outputs that people can take a
[4705.10 → 4705.44] look through.
[4706.10 → 4706.38] Oh.
[4707.12 → 4708.20] Dang it, you have to log in for
[4708.20 → 4708.44] this?
[4709.72 → 4710.10] Oh.
[4710.30 → 4710.96] No, you do not.
[4711.02 → 4712.28] You can just say, no, I do not
[4712.28 → 4713.10] wish to do that.
[4713.10 → 4715.72] Uh, I can't tell if I have
[4715.72 → 4716.66] actually, no, this is just
[4716.66 → 4717.26] their homepage.
[4717.82 → 4718.70] Dang it, you guys.
[4719.90 → 4720.22] Ugh.
[4721.36 → 4721.98] All right.
[4722.22 → 4724.38] Well, apparently I can't find
[4724.38 → 4726.46] that, so that's annoying.
[4726.66 → 4728.40] But there's a gallery somewhere.
[4729.54 → 4730.50] Uh, this one is apparently
[4730.50 → 4732.10] generated from Sunny Day in
[4732.10 → 4732.48] Canada.
[4733.98 → 4734.38] Wow.
[4734.50 → 4735.38] That's really impressive.
[4736.50 → 4737.82] I'd believe that's a Sunny Day
[4737.82 → 4738.28] in Canada.
[4738.42 → 4739.04] Oh, 100%.
[4739.04 → 4742.44] That's super cool.
[4742.54 → 4743.34] Oh, Dream Up Collection.
[4743.48 → 4745.28] Okay, can we, no, of course I
[4745.28 → 4745.92] can't click that.
[4745.96 → 4746.74] Why would I be able to click
[4746.74 → 4746.98] that?
[4747.04 → 4748.46] That would be just too, that
[4748.46 → 4749.26] would be too convenient.
[4749.46 → 4750.20] All right, fine, whatever.
[4750.28 → 4750.72] It doesn't matter.
[4751.34 → 4752.64] Uh, what do I know about
[4752.64 → 4753.42] interface anyway?
[4753.98 → 4755.74] Um, DeviantArt also published
[4755.74 → 4757.16] their stance on AI art.
[4757.40 → 4758.74] So they said artists should be
[4758.74 → 4760.42] able to tell third-party AI
[4760.42 → 4761.74] data sets not to use their
[4761.74 → 4762.10] content.
[4762.64 → 4763.52] Artists should be able to
[4763.52 → 4766.10] choose whether AI
[4766.10 → 4767.42] images can be generated in
[4767.42 → 4767.94] their style.
[4767.94 → 4769.52] If an artist isn't opted
[4769.52 → 4770.88] out and their style is
[4770.88 → 4771.88] referenced in a prompt, they
[4771.88 → 4772.92] should be clearly credited.
[4773.68 → 4774.76] AI images should be clearly
[4774.76 → 4775.52] marked as such.
[4775.88 → 4776.92] Viewers should have control
[4776.92 → 4778.28] over how much AI art they
[4778.28 → 4778.60] see.
[4779.08 → 4780.10] AI should not be used for
[4780.10 → 4781.56] abusive or hateful content.
[4782.02 → 4783.42] And they said they're not
[4783.42 → 4784.88] ready for monetization.
[4785.44 → 4786.72] For artists who want to opt
[4786.72 → 4787.64] out, it appears that when
[4787.64 → 4789.28] they upload a work, there's a
[4789.28 → 4790.78] checkbox you can click to not
[4790.78 → 4792.18] authorize for AI data sets,
[4792.36 → 4793.60] though it can be edited on
[4793.60 → 4794.64] existing deviations.
[4795.36 → 4797.72] Um, later they plan on adding
[4797.72 → 4799.18] a way to flag all deviations
[4799.18 → 4800.24] uploaded to a profile.
[4800.78 → 4801.90] Anthony had a note here.
[4802.40 → 4803.14] Everyone should be able to
[4803.14 → 4803.84] opt out regardless.
[4804.22 → 4804.40] Yeah.
[4804.84 → 4806.28] Uh, but only some can opt
[4806.28 → 4808.28] out globally and only by
[4808.28 → 4809.52] filling out a Google form
[4809.52 → 4810.76] with a 10 business day lead
[4810.76 → 4811.02] time.
[4811.14 → 4811.34] Yeah.
[4811.40 → 4811.66] Okay.
[4811.74 → 4812.54] So that's interesting.
[4813.72 → 4814.94] Our discussion question is
[4814.94 → 4816.54] how's this good versus how's
[4816.54 → 4817.50] this bad for artists?
[4817.50 → 4819.00] I think that regardless of
[4819.00 → 4820.54] how good or bad it is for
[4820.54 → 4821.96] artists, this stuff is
[4821.96 → 4822.64] happening.
[4823.56 → 4825.84] AI art is not going away any
[4825.84 → 4827.30] time soon.
[4827.48 → 4827.58] Yeah.
[4827.60 → 4828.14] That's interesting.
[4828.26 → 4830.04] The, uh, generating art in
[4830.04 → 4830.88] people's style.
[4831.02 → 4833.28] How do you even prove like,
[4833.36 → 4834.18] I feel like they could back
[4834.18 → 4834.88] up and be like, no, it's just
[4834.88 → 4835.58] someone else's style that
[4835.58 → 4836.36] looks like yours.
[4836.40 → 4837.10] Let alone that's such an
[4837.10 → 4838.56] interesting feature to choose
[4838.56 → 4839.30] to implement.
[4839.98 → 4841.04] Or just happened by accident.
[4841.12 → 4841.48] Sorry, man.
[4841.52 → 4842.58] I don't, I don't know.
[4842.66 → 4842.76] Yeah.
[4842.76 → 4843.78] How do they police that?
[4844.22 → 4845.24] And especially the
[4845.24 → 4846.68] accreditation again, how do
[4846.68 → 4847.66] they police that unless it's
[4847.66 → 4848.62] like a watermark on the
[4848.62 → 4851.34] photo, but that just seems so
[4851.34 → 4851.68] messy.
[4851.68 → 4852.98] Oh, they apparently backpedalled
[4852.98 → 4854.22] a bit and said that people
[4854.22 → 4855.02] will be opted out
[4855.02 → 4855.58] automatically.
[4856.28 → 4857.38] I don't remember the last
[4857.38 → 4858.44] time I ended up on Deviant
[4858.44 → 4859.60] Art though, to be perfectly
[4859.60 → 4860.12] honest with you.
[4860.14 → 4861.30] I don't, I don't, I'm not
[4861.30 → 4862.16] saying they're not relevant.
[4862.28 → 4864.68] I'm just saying that as, you
[4864.68 → 4866.36] know, not an artist, I don't
[4866.36 → 4867.90] know that they are relevant.
[4868.50 → 4868.62] Yeah.
[4868.68 → 4869.50] And OmniAwell says you have
[4869.50 → 4870.62] to opt out per picture.
[4870.84 → 4872.78] So you can't just opt out like
[4872.78 → 4873.54] all of your art.
[4873.72 → 4874.66] You would have to like select
[4874.66 → 4875.64] what art you don't want to
[4875.64 → 4875.92] allow.
[4876.46 → 4876.96] I don't know.
[4877.14 → 4878.00] You know what I would never
[4878.00 → 4878.68] opt out of?
[4879.10 → 4880.30] Replying to merch messages.
[4880.46 → 4881.32] Why don't we hit some merch
[4881.32 → 4882.38] messages here, Mr.
[4882.38 → 4883.02] Relevance?
[4883.20 → 4884.18] I would love to.
[4885.40 → 4887.04] First one I have here is from
[4887.04 → 4887.54] Ben.
[4888.04 → 4889.08] Have you considered doing a
[4889.08 → 4890.16] follow-up to the Cardboard
[4890.16 → 4890.94] PC Challenge?
[4891.44 → 4892.82] I recently re-watched it and
[4892.82 → 4893.54] would love a follow-up
[4893.54 → 4894.46] potentially with different
[4894.46 → 4895.02] materials.
[4895.92 → 4896.30] Yes.
[4896.84 → 4898.28] The main difference between
[4898.28 → 4900.12] the next Cardboard PC Case
[4900.12 → 4901.80] Challenge and the last one is
[4901.80 → 4903.00] that we're going to provide the
[4903.00 → 4903.94] teams with more time.
[4904.32 → 4905.76] I think last time we did two
[4905.76 → 4907.60] hours and the goal this time
[4907.60 → 4909.44] around is to either do four or a
[4909.44 → 4911.84] full day, giving us time to
[4911.84 → 4914.70] really lay out a plan and try to
[4914.70 → 4915.28] execute it.
[4915.52 → 4917.56] I think that that will give me
[4917.56 → 4919.46] far less of an advantage than
[4919.46 → 4922.80] last time because if Team Alex
[4922.80 → 4924.88] had actually had time, I think
[4924.88 → 4926.30] they have the skills to make a
[4926.30 → 4928.36] much better case than what I would
[4928.36 → 4929.18] be able to put together.
[4929.18 → 4931.46] But because Jake and I were smart
[4931.46 → 4933.98] enough to allocate enough of our
[4933.98 → 4937.14] time to actually planning our
[4937.14 → 4939.32] folds and planning our case, we
[4939.32 → 4941.92] came out ahead of their kind of
[4941.92 → 4942.82] YOLO approach.
[4942.90 → 4944.14] Whereas if you give them more time
[4944.14 → 4945.34] and they know that they can plan,
[4945.46 → 4947.16] I think Alex and I forget who was
[4947.16 → 4949.74] on Alex's team, but I think that
[4949.74 → 4952.46] they would be able to beat us.
[4952.50 → 4953.46] But I'm super down.
[4953.64 → 4955.72] I'm super down for a rematch and the
[4955.72 → 4956.64] video performed well.
[4956.64 → 4959.38] So that's always a good sign for
[4959.38 → 4961.54] getting another, getting a sequel to
[4961.54 → 4961.76] it.
[4963.20 → 4964.96] Next question here is from Bryce.
[4965.64 → 4967.04] Are there any weird or random
[4967.04 → 4968.42] requests they can think of from
[4968.42 → 4969.08] sponsors?
[4969.48 → 4971.46] Hard mode, brand doesn't count.
[4972.58 → 4973.80] Weird requests.
[4973.98 → 4975.62] I mean, Fractal back in the day used
[4975.62 → 4977.08] to do some really weird stuff.
[4977.18 → 4979.36] They had me get pied in the face.
[4981.22 → 4983.08] Weird requests from sponsors.
[4983.08 → 4986.42] Most, most sponsors are not that
[4986.42 → 4988.34] outside the box thinking, to be
[4988.34 → 4989.12] honest with you.
[4989.96 → 4991.56] And I'd be, Bell, you worked on the
[4991.56 → 4992.12] business team.
[4992.20 → 4993.38] Like, can you think of anything?
[4993.84 → 4995.72] It's mostly brand, but I love the
[4995.72 → 4996.06] wholesome.
[4996.34 → 4997.60] Is it Sea sonic that just does a
[4997.60 → 4998.08] Merry Christmas?
[4998.30 → 4999.58] There's no talking points or anything.
[4999.72 → 5000.08] It's just.
[5000.14 → 5001.24] Yeah, we've done that a couple of
[5001.24 → 5001.52] times.
[5001.52 → 5001.80] Say Merry Christmas.
[5001.80 → 5005.38] But yeah, most, I mean, they want to
[5005.38 → 5006.28] make sure you know what the product
[5006.28 → 5007.72] is, which means that you're pretty
[5007.72 → 5009.58] limited on how weird things can get.
[5010.92 → 5012.44] But I did liked brand's recent one of
[5012.44 → 5015.16] etching in the iPad, shortlinus.com.
[5015.66 → 5018.16] So we have an etched iPad that is, we'll
[5018.16 → 5020.36] always say shortlinus.com.
[5020.48 → 5020.88] Oh, good.
[5021.82 → 5022.60] That's helpful.
[5023.92 → 5025.68] Question here from Anon.
[5026.64 → 5027.42] Hi, Linus.
[5027.54 → 5028.46] Are you going to make sure your kid's
[5028.46 → 5029.24] not a touch type?
[5029.60 → 5031.16] On a similar note, how do you feel about
[5031.16 → 5032.88] younger generations maybe being less
[5032.88 → 5033.88] digitally literate?
[5035.44 → 5037.02] My son already touched types.
[5037.96 → 5039.86] My eldest daughter is already learning.
[5040.06 → 5042.00] They do typing class in school, so
[5042.00 → 5043.48] theoretically, I shouldn't really have
[5043.48 → 5044.26] to intervene.
[5045.90 → 5047.38] I mean, realistically, they're both
[5047.38 → 5048.84] picking it up for the same reasons
[5048.84 → 5049.78] that I did, gaming.
[5050.44 → 5052.80] They love Minecraft, and you just,
[5053.28 → 5054.82] you can't look away from the screen,
[5054.92 → 5055.92] so you better learn to touch type.
[5056.60 → 5058.06] That's the bottom line.
[5059.64 → 5060.78] Yeah, so they at least know,
[5061.16 → 5063.26] where Wast is, and that is important.
[5066.34 → 5067.92] Okay, so this was a question for Luke,
[5068.12 → 5069.40] but it'd be interesting to hear your answer.
[5069.58 → 5070.26] This is from Jesse.
[5070.78 → 5072.64] If the roles had been reversed back in the day,
[5073.12 → 5074.48] and Luke was the higher up,
[5074.94 → 5077.48] would he have hired you for Luke tech tips?
[5080.88 → 5082.24] I think I'm pretty good.
[5082.24 → 5084.30] I think I'm pretty good at what I do.
[5086.00 → 5086.44] Yeah.
[5087.06 → 5088.86] Yeah, I think so.
[5089.20 → 5089.86] I don't know.
[5090.00 → 5092.54] Well, maybe we might have to ask him again next week,
[5092.72 → 5095.44] but yeah, I think he would.
[5096.00 → 5098.72] My skills complement his pretty well.
[5099.62 → 5100.72] He's thinking about it.
[5100.72 → 5104.98] Question here for Matthew.
[5105.40 → 5107.66] What's going on with video aspect ratios these days?
[5107.88 → 5108.92] Some traditional TV shows,
[5109.02 → 5110.30] Netflix shows, and YouTube channels,
[5110.40 → 5111.04] including LTT,
[5111.28 → 5112.10] are an 18 by 9.
[5112.28 → 5113.70] It seems objectively worse.
[5113.96 → 5115.56] Over 11% of my screen is now blank.
[5115.74 → 5116.42] Why the change?
[5116.78 → 5117.84] Ah, that's a good question.
[5118.30 → 5121.46] We went from 16 by 9 to 18 by 9,
[5121.46 → 5123.12] also known as 2 to 1,
[5123.82 → 5125.56] a few years back, I think.
[5125.80 → 5126.52] Quite a while.
[5126.84 → 5129.20] And the rationale behind it
[5129.20 → 5130.70] was that our viewership
[5130.70 → 5132.74] had gone to predominantly mobile,
[5133.30 → 5136.32] and mobile devices were starting to ship
[5136.32 → 5138.00] in these aspect ratios
[5138.00 → 5140.30] that were much wider than 16 by 9.
[5140.40 → 5144.30] Like, you can't find a 16 by 9 smartphone anymore,
[5144.42 → 5144.88] pretty much.
[5145.32 → 5147.22] So with that in mind,
[5147.38 → 5149.80] now that we had these long devices,
[5149.80 → 5151.56] if the majority of our audience
[5151.56 → 5153.26] was going to be watching on mobile,
[5154.06 → 5156.52] we didn't want to leave them
[5156.52 → 5159.26] with just giant black pillars
[5159.26 → 5161.20] on either side of their screen.
[5161.68 → 5164.38] However, if we went all the way to the
[5164.56 → 5165.76] you know, there are some smartphones
[5165.76 → 5168.00] that have super, super tall displays.
[5168.36 → 5170.34] So if we went all the way widescreen,
[5170.48 → 5173.40] you know, almost like a cinema aspect ratio,
[5173.72 → 5174.72] well, then that would leave
[5174.72 → 5177.18] really, really thick black bars
[5177.18 → 5179.04] on our desktop viewer screens.
[5179.04 → 5181.46] So we ended up going with
[5181.46 → 5183.16] what we felt was a happy medium,
[5183.30 → 5183.76] two to one,
[5183.90 → 5185.92] which leaves small black bars
[5185.92 → 5187.14] on a desktop monitor
[5187.14 → 5188.98] and small black pillars
[5188.98 → 5190.38] on the majority of smartphones.
[5194.88 → 5196.56] Question here from Brad.
[5197.48 → 5198.42] Howdy from Texas.
[5198.90 → 5200.92] Would you ever consider going on hot ones?
[5201.22 → 5202.98] How are you with spicy foods in general?
[5203.28 → 5204.68] I'm all right with spicy food.
[5204.68 → 5208.56] Um, I generally don't eat supper,
[5208.72 → 5209.68] super spicy food
[5209.68 → 5212.44] because, uh, my mouth likes it,
[5212.54 → 5213.78] but the other parts of me
[5213.78 → 5215.74] are not as into it.
[5216.44 → 5218.76] Um, as for what I consider
[5218.76 → 5219.80] going on hot ones,
[5219.86 → 5220.82] I mean, it's one of those things
[5220.82 → 5222.36] where there's nothing to consider
[5222.36 → 5224.32] if, um, I haven't been invited.
[5224.46 → 5225.92] So I don't know.
[5226.06 → 5226.74] Maybe, sure.
[5226.96 → 5227.78] Or maybe not.
[5228.44 → 5229.62] Uh, oh, hold on.
[5229.80 → 5230.36] I don't want to,
[5230.42 → 5231.38] I don't want to say that
[5231.38 → 5232.66] like I'm putting them on the spot.
[5232.66 → 5234.66] Maybe they, maybe they did invite me
[5234.66 → 5235.16] at some point.
[5235.30 → 5235.86] Let's put them on the spot.
[5235.96 → 5237.36] Sean Evans, hit us up.
[5237.54 → 5238.04] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[5238.04 → 5239.96] Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[5240.46 → 5242.48] I, I, just a, just a second.
[5242.58 → 5244.22] I, I might have been invited at some point.
[5245.00 → 5245.36] Um.
[5247.76 → 5248.00] Yeah.
[5248.62 → 5250.28] Oh, come on.
[5251.16 → 5251.98] I swear.
[5252.10 → 5254.76] Gmail search just keeps getting worse.
[5257.08 → 5257.58] Oh yeah.
[5257.64 → 5258.10] Hold on.
[5258.42 → 5258.96] Oh, no, wait.
[5258.98 → 5259.90] This is from Workcation.
[5259.90 → 5262.20] We did our own hot ones thing.
[5263.22 → 5265.14] Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5265.68 → 5266.00] Okay.
[5266.12 → 5267.68] No, I don't think, yeah, no, I don't,
[5267.76 → 5269.56] I don't think I've been invited to hot ones.
[5269.60 → 5269.88] So there.
[5270.20 → 5270.68] It's, uh.
[5271.56 → 5273.00] Oh, oh, you know what I did find
[5273.00 → 5274.40] is my favourite tweet of all time, though.
[5274.88 → 5276.64] This is my favourite tweet of all time.
[5278.24 → 5279.44] Twitter is the only place
[5279.44 → 5280.90] where well-articulated sentences
[5280.90 → 5282.22] still get misinterpreted.
[5282.40 → 5283.02] You can say,
[5283.26 → 5284.16] I like pancakes.
[5284.44 → 5285.34] And somebody will say,
[5285.68 → 5286.72] so you hate waffles?
[5287.88 → 5288.24] No.
[5288.24 → 5290.90] That's a whole new sentence.
[5291.42 → 5293.12] What the f*** is you talking about?
[5293.22 → 5293.92] I love it.
[5294.02 → 5296.86] It's, it's the entire platform
[5296.86 → 5297.64] in a nutshell.
[5297.78 → 5300.44] 100% my favourite tweet of all time.
[5300.44 → 5301.86] And it was, uh,
[5301.86 → 5303.04] when I was talking about something
[5303.04 → 5303.84] on the WAN show
[5303.84 → 5304.48] and people,
[5304.76 → 5304.80] we,
[5305.36 → 5305.58] we,
[5305.68 → 5305.70] we,
[5305.70 → 5305.92] we,
[5305.92 → 5306.14] we,
[5306.14 → 5306.20] we,
[5306.20 → 5306.28] we,
[5306.28 → 5306.68] we,
[5306.68 → 5306.74] we,
[5306.74 → 5306.76] we,
[5306.76 → 5306.80] we,
[5306.80 → 5307.52] we,
[5307.52 → 5308.10] we,
[5308.34 → 5308.38] we,
[5308.38 → 5308.46] we,
[5308.48 → 5308.70] we,
[5308.72 → 5310.16] we,
[5310.16 → 5310.62] we,
[5311.84 → 5312.48] we,
[5312.48 → 5312.68] we,
[5312.70 → 5313.32] we,
[5313.34 → 5313.78] we,
[5313.80 → 5313.90] we,
[5313.90 → 5314.06] we,
[5315.06 → 5315.88] we,
[5315.92 → 5316.32] we,
[5316.88 → 5317.04] we,
[5317.04 → 5317.58] we,
[5317.58 → 5318.18] we,
[5318.18 → 5318.62] we,
[5318.80 → 5320.22] we,
[5320.22 → 5320.52] we,
[5321.58 → 5322.24] we,
[5322.24 → 5323.34] for a given resolution?
[5323.94 → 5325.24] No and no.
[5325.76 → 5327.34] There can be buggy behaviour
[5327.34 → 5327.98] when you're gaming
[5327.98 → 5329.28] with multiple monitors
[5329.28 → 5330.44] attached to your GPU.
[5331.06 → 5332.18] I've seen everything
[5332.18 → 5333.10] from like standby
[5333.10 → 5334.24] not working properly
[5334.24 → 5335.66] to lower performance.
[5336.28 → 5338.44] But theoretically, no.
[5338.90 → 5339.84] It should only be
[5339.84 → 5340.84] the game assets
[5340.84 → 5341.78] that are being loaded
[5341.78 → 5342.56] into VRAM
[5342.56 → 5344.46] that is taking it up.
[5345.44 → 5346.74] And as for how many works
[5346.74 → 5347.44] at a given resolution,
[5347.56 → 5349.78] well, it depends on the size
[5349.78 → 5350.82] of the quality of the textures.
[5352.24 → 5353.86] Question here from Lucas.
[5354.42 → 5356.24] How are your AirPods Pros 2s
[5356.24 → 5356.86] holding up?
[5357.00 → 5357.82] Would you still recommend them
[5357.82 → 5358.78] to Android users?
[5360.58 → 5361.06] Great.
[5362.38 → 5364.24] I mean, I don't know
[5364.24 → 5365.52] that I recommend them
[5365.52 → 5366.44] to Android users.
[5366.58 → 5367.88] There's absolutely problems
[5367.88 → 5369.30] using AirPods on Android.
[5370.00 → 5371.44] Like it's, you know,
[5371.46 → 5372.44] not having first party
[5372.44 → 5373.38] battery monitoring
[5373.38 → 5374.02] and stuff like that.
[5374.06 → 5374.86] Like it's just a guess
[5374.86 → 5375.92] when I put them in my ears,
[5375.98 → 5377.02] whether they're charged or not.
[5377.02 → 5378.36] So I just have to stay
[5378.36 → 5378.88] on top of it.
[5378.92 → 5379.70] Otherwise, I'll just
[5379.70 → 5380.88] I'll go and put them in the ears.
[5380.94 → 5381.46] Oh, they're dead.
[5381.52 → 5381.70] Great.
[5381.70 → 5382.66] This is fantastic.
[5382.92 → 5383.62] They're the world's
[5383.62 → 5384.90] most expensive earplugs.
[5384.98 → 5385.14] Right.
[5385.24 → 5389.28] So I still like them
[5389.28 → 5390.58] and I haven't found
[5390.58 → 5393.06] a complete replacement for them.
[5393.32 → 5394.08] I found things
[5394.08 → 5395.50] that do certain aspects
[5395.50 → 5396.90] of what I love
[5396.90 → 5397.48] about the AirPods
[5397.48 → 5398.80] as well or better.
[5398.80 → 5399.74] But I have yet
[5399.74 → 5400.50] to find something
[5400.50 → 5402.12] that completely replaces
[5402.12 → 5403.36] the AirPods for me.
[5404.62 → 5406.46] Yeah, AirPods are pretty great,
[5406.52 → 5407.12] but I use iPhone.
[5407.28 → 5408.36] So I'm biased.
[5409.70 → 5410.64] Question here from Patrick.
[5410.64 → 5411.46] With the move
[5411.46 → 5412.72] towards all electric cars,
[5413.80 → 5414.66] is there any real fear
[5414.66 → 5415.16] of them becoming
[5415.16 → 5416.50] a massive amount of e-waste
[5416.50 → 5417.38] with the cost of replacing
[5417.38 → 5418.04] a battery later
[5418.04 → 5419.20] in the car's lifespan?
[5419.90 → 5420.30] Absolutely.
[5420.68 → 5421.22] I mean, that's
[5421.22 → 5423.96] one of the biggest challenges
[5423.96 → 5424.72] that faces
[5424.72 → 5425.72] the electric car industry.
[5425.78 → 5426.26] And you hear a lot
[5426.26 → 5427.18] of people talk about,
[5427.62 → 5428.08] well, the batteries
[5428.08 → 5428.76] are recyclable.
[5430.76 → 5431.76] Are they, though,
[5431.90 → 5433.52] at the scale
[5433.52 → 5434.40] that we need them
[5434.40 → 5435.36] to be recyclable?
[5435.42 → 5436.66] At what efficiency rate?
[5436.72 → 5438.18] Who's actually working on this?
[5438.18 → 5439.18] Is it commercially viable?
[5439.26 → 5440.14] There's still a lot
[5440.14 → 5440.78] of questions
[5440.78 → 5443.48] about electric car battery
[5443.48 → 5445.20] recycling and repurposing.
[5445.92 → 5446.66] And yeah,
[5446.72 → 5447.74] it's a huge concern.
[5447.84 → 5448.38] It's one of the things
[5448.38 → 5449.62] I love about the Chevy Volt
[5449.62 → 5450.08] so much.
[5450.14 → 5451.34] Man, I think it's so stupid
[5451.34 → 5452.52] they discontinued that car.
[5452.60 → 5454.18] It is a technological marvel.
[5454.32 → 5455.04] It's so cool.
[5455.04 → 5457.92] And while it is sort of
[5457.92 → 5459.04] the worst of both worlds
[5459.04 → 5460.06] in that it has,
[5460.60 → 5462.06] it gives up the reliability
[5462.06 → 5463.58] of an all-electric car,
[5463.96 → 5464.70] like the simplicity
[5464.70 → 5466.20] of an all-electric car,
[5466.36 → 5467.86] and also, you know,
[5467.90 → 5469.72] gives up the cost benefit
[5469.72 → 5472.52] of an internal combustion
[5472.52 → 5473.08] engine car
[5473.08 → 5473.90] because it has to be loaded
[5473.90 → 5475.38] with electric motors
[5475.38 → 5476.20] and like a whole,
[5476.30 → 5477.52] you know, battery pack
[5477.52 → 5477.96] and stuff.
[5478.70 → 5480.16] It also has the benefits
[5480.16 → 5480.88] of both worlds.
[5480.98 → 5482.12] I do the vast majority
[5482.12 → 5482.72] of my driving
[5482.72 → 5485.28] on this much smaller battery
[5485.28 → 5487.04] that required far less lithium
[5487.04 → 5487.70] to be mined.
[5488.04 → 5489.64] And if I do need to go far,
[5490.00 → 5490.40] book,
[5490.50 → 5492.22] turn on the gas-powered generator
[5492.22 → 5493.32] and off I go.
[5493.38 → 5494.28] I can hardly tell the difference
[5494.28 → 5495.14] when I'm operating it.
[5495.96 → 5498.44] I think that plug-in hybrids,
[5499.18 → 5499.40] ugh,
[5500.30 → 5501.10] A, they weren't marketed
[5501.10 → 5502.30] very well in the first place,
[5502.40 → 5503.38] particularly by Chevy's
[5503.38 → 5504.02] dealer network,
[5504.50 → 5505.60] and B,
[5506.20 → 5507.30] a lot of them
[5507.30 → 5508.86] gave that label
[5508.86 → 5510.06] a bad name
[5510.06 → 5511.18] because plug-in hybrids
[5511.18 → 5512.16] like the Prius Prime
[5512.16 → 5512.96] that only have
[5512.96 → 5514.32] like 30 kilometres,
[5514.58 → 5516.06] 40 kilometres of range
[5516.06 → 5516.70] at best.
[5517.74 → 5519.08] They're not useful
[5519.08 → 5519.80] in the same way
[5519.80 → 5520.84] that the Volt is.
[5520.94 → 5522.20] It'll do like 70
[5522.20 → 5523.58] to 90 kilometres
[5523.58 → 5524.20] on battery.
[5524.30 → 5525.00] That's outstanding.
[5525.16 → 5526.30] That's to and from
[5526.30 → 5528.18] even a pretty substantial
[5528.18 → 5529.50] commute.
[5530.62 → 5532.02] So you're actually
[5532.02 → 5533.16] not using gas.
[5533.80 → 5534.66] And so I'm,
[5534.78 → 5535.46] it's very frustrating
[5535.46 → 5536.32] to me that,
[5536.44 → 5537.68] that category of vehicles
[5537.68 → 5539.16] just kind of
[5539.16 → 5540.42] was underappreciated
[5540.42 → 5541.16] for so long
[5541.16 → 5542.34] that the Volt got killed
[5542.34 → 5544.10] when it could have been
[5544.10 → 5545.58] a great solution
[5545.58 → 5547.74] to burning
[5547.74 → 5549.34] far less fossil fuels
[5549.34 → 5550.48] but also mining
[5550.48 → 5551.46] far less lithium.
[5553.10 → 5553.14] Yeah,
[5553.18 → 5553.70] and there's still
[5553.70 → 5554.82] decent ways
[5554.82 → 5555.62] of recycling
[5555.62 → 5556.42] car batteries,
[5556.58 → 5557.70] but I mean,
[5557.72 → 5558.30] at this point,
[5558.60 → 5559.56] we don't have
[5559.56 → 5560.68] a ton of aged
[5560.68 → 5561.76] EV batteries
[5561.76 → 5562.36] to do a bunch
[5562.36 → 5563.00] of testing on
[5563.00 → 5564.12] and a lot of its expensive.
[5564.62 → 5565.74] And will it actually
[5565.74 → 5566.26] be recycled
[5566.26 → 5567.00] are all questions
[5567.00 → 5567.52] that haven't been
[5567.52 → 5568.00] answered yet.
[5568.18 → 5568.36] Yep.
[5569.92 → 5570.90] Next question here
[5570.90 → 5571.34] is from
[5571.34 → 5573.52] Crispy Umbrella.
[5574.12 → 5574.54] Do you have any
[5574.54 → 5575.54] thoughts on Mastodon
[5575.54 → 5576.40] as a decentralized
[5576.40 → 5577.62] Twitter alternative?
[5578.18 → 5579.22] I saw you guys
[5579.22 → 5580.02] talking about it earlier
[5580.02 → 5580.58] and the reason
[5580.58 → 5581.52] that I didn't
[5581.52 → 5582.58] really get into it
[5582.58 → 5584.00] is because I haven't
[5584.00 → 5585.02] looked into it.
[5585.32 → 5586.22] It seems like
[5586.22 → 5586.82] on the surface
[5586.82 → 5587.58] there could be a lot
[5587.58 → 5588.46] of really cool things
[5588.46 → 5588.92] about it.
[5589.22 → 5590.12] I've seen it described
[5590.12 → 5591.52] as kind of the Linux
[5591.52 → 5594.12] of social platforms.
[5594.12 → 5595.56] So there are some
[5595.56 → 5596.38] things that are
[5596.38 → 5597.36] a little arcane,
[5597.52 → 5598.08] a little difficult
[5598.08 → 5599.50] to navigate
[5599.50 → 5601.04] or a little
[5601.04 → 5601.98] unintuitive,
[5601.98 → 5603.18] but it's not something
[5603.18 → 5604.60] that I have actually
[5604.60 → 5606.28] invested any time in.
[5606.52 → 5607.26] That's something
[5607.26 → 5608.52] that you'll see
[5608.52 → 5608.94] from me.
[5609.04 → 5609.72] It's pretty normal
[5609.72 → 5610.30] when it comes
[5610.30 → 5611.36] to new platforms
[5611.36 → 5613.06] to sort of
[5613.06 → 5613.96] put your brand on.
[5614.08 → 5615.06] I tend to be
[5615.06 → 5616.70] extremely slow moving.
[5617.18 → 5618.38] Like I never invested
[5618.38 → 5619.58] any time in Vine
[5619.58 → 5620.74] or Periscope.
[5620.80 → 5621.38] That worked out
[5621.38 → 5622.20] great for me.
[5622.64 → 5623.68] Pretty much everything
[5623.68 → 5624.46] I've picked
[5624.46 → 5625.16] historically
[5625.16 → 5626.66] has gone on
[5626.66 → 5627.46] for a very,
[5627.62 → 5628.60] very long time.
[5629.14 → 5629.88] And so I'm
[5629.88 → 5631.42] I'm just
[5631.42 → 5632.62] I'm in wait and see
[5632.62 → 5633.06] mode.
[5633.38 → 5634.34] We might try to have
[5634.34 → 5635.20] a presence on Mastodon
[5635.20 → 5635.80] at some point,
[5635.90 → 5637.28] but that might not
[5637.28 → 5638.20] happen until
[5638.20 → 5639.92] Twitter actually
[5639.92 → 5640.54] implodes.
[5641.00 → 5641.70] With that said,
[5641.82 → 5642.68] Twitter might implode
[5642.68 → 5643.42] a lot faster
[5643.42 → 5644.04] than I thought
[5644.04 → 5644.84] it was going to.
[5645.00 → 5646.82] So we'll see.
[5647.34 → 5648.44] We have a lot
[5648.44 → 5648.90] of questions
[5648.90 → 5649.84] about merch,
[5649.84 → 5650.56] so I'm going to
[5650.56 → 5651.44] kind of generalize
[5651.44 → 5652.06] a lot of them.
[5652.28 → 5652.92] Do you have any
[5652.92 → 5654.58] updates on any
[5654.58 → 5655.64] fun merch products
[5655.64 → 5656.64] you want to share
[5656.64 → 5657.38] or spoil?
[5657.58 → 5657.98] There's people
[5657.98 → 5658.70] asking about
[5658.70 → 5659.48] wind breakers
[5659.48 → 5660.32] or sun shirts.
[5660.92 → 5661.36] We have a
[5661.36 → 5662.18] wind breaker coming.
[5663.60 → 5663.70] The
[5663.70 → 5664.02] the
[5664.02 → 5664.30] the
[5664.36 → 5664.66] oh,
[5664.90 → 5665.20] oh,
[5665.92 → 5666.88] the UV hoodie.
[5667.20 → 5667.72] So the UV
[5667.72 → 5668.52] blocking hoodie
[5668.52 → 5670.28] is amazing.
[5670.84 → 5671.06] Okay.
[5671.08 → 5672.22] I took our first,
[5672.36 → 5673.66] like our first sample
[5673.66 → 5675.18] prototype on my trip
[5675.18 → 5675.68] to Hawaii
[5675.68 → 5678.20] and it rocked.
[5678.20 → 5679.88] like so breathable.
[5680.02 → 5680.88] The lightest breeze
[5680.88 → 5681.98] goes right through it,
[5681.98 → 5683.34] but it keeps the sun
[5683.34 → 5683.78] off.
[5683.98 → 5684.32] Um,
[5684.32 → 5684.98] so it helped me
[5684.98 → 5685.70] avoid getting,
[5686.12 → 5687.06] never mind burned.
[5687.16 → 5688.04] I barely even tanned
[5688.04 → 5688.70] while I was there.
[5689.00 → 5689.42] Uh,
[5689.42 → 5690.34] so it was awesome
[5690.34 → 5690.90] for that.
[5691.02 → 5692.54] And I went swimming
[5692.54 → 5693.00] in it,
[5693.32 → 5693.98] not one,
[5694.14 → 5694.68] not two,
[5694.82 → 5695.28] not three,
[5695.38 → 5696.50] but four times.
[5696.50 → 5697.72] And it still
[5697.72 → 5698.44] didn't stink
[5698.44 → 5699.52] because it's using
[5699.52 → 5700.10] like a
[5700.16 → 5700.98] like it's got bamboo
[5700.98 → 5701.62] in the fabric,
[5701.62 → 5702.66] which has really great
[5702.66 → 5703.78] antimicrobial properties
[5703.78 → 5704.72] and stuff like that.
[5705.14 → 5705.58] So.
[5705.58 → 5707.08] You swam in a jacket?
[5707.72 → 5707.92] Well,
[5708.02 → 5708.28] I was,
[5708.38 → 5709.52] I was wearing it
[5709.52 → 5710.52] when I just like,
[5710.58 → 5711.36] would like go wading
[5711.36 → 5711.86] in the ocean
[5711.86 → 5712.58] with the kids.
[5712.80 → 5713.22] Uh,
[5713.22 → 5714.10] we went parasailing
[5714.10 → 5715.36] and they dipped us
[5715.36 → 5715.92] at the end
[5715.92 → 5716.64] and I was wearing it
[5716.64 → 5717.40] during that.
[5717.54 → 5717.88] Like,
[5717.92 → 5718.30] like it just,
[5718.36 → 5719.08] it got wet,
[5719.20 → 5719.90] uh,
[5719.90 → 5720.62] four times.
[5720.74 → 5721.60] Once was rain,
[5721.88 → 5722.60] once wasn't swimming,
[5722.82 → 5723.26] uh,
[5723.26 → 5724.80] but it got wet four times
[5724.80 → 5725.86] and I still like picked it up
[5725.86 → 5726.06] and like,
[5726.14 → 5726.90] this is wearable.
[5727.22 → 5728.16] This is amazing.
[5728.66 → 5729.76] I'm super stoked.
[5730.92 → 5731.32] Yeah,
[5731.44 → 5731.90] that is,
[5732.02 → 5732.22] uh,
[5732.22 → 5733.24] not what I expected
[5733.24 → 5734.20] that to end with,
[5734.28 → 5735.18] but you know,
[5735.18 → 5735.96] it's good to know
[5735.96 → 5736.74] this is a hoodie
[5736.74 → 5738.02] or Jackie you can swim in.
[5738.50 → 5738.68] Well,
[5738.78 → 5740.32] that's not the point.
[5743.52 → 5743.92] Uh,
[5744.02 → 5745.12] question here from Anon.
[5745.48 → 5746.52] Has a team ever considered
[5746.52 → 5747.68] benchmarking VR games
[5747.68 → 5748.64] like Half-Life Alex
[5748.64 → 5749.22] or Medal of Honour?
[5749.36 → 5750.54] I think VR has a lot of potential
[5750.54 → 5750.88] in the
[5751.02 → 5751.80] hopefully not too long,
[5751.90 → 5752.18] future
[5752.18 → 5753.52] and having performance data
[5753.52 → 5754.18] on it would be
[5754.18 → 5755.30] quite interesting.
[5755.70 → 5755.90] Uh,
[5755.90 → 5757.38] it's something we do want to
[5757.38 → 5758.82] look into
[5758.82 → 5760.06] and learn about,
[5760.42 → 5760.86] um,
[5760.92 → 5762.30] but it's something that is
[5762.30 → 5763.06] very,
[5763.18 → 5763.82] very,
[5763.82 → 5764.98] very challenging.
[5765.30 → 5767.12] Pretty much every VR game
[5767.12 → 5768.12] that I'm aware of
[5768.12 → 5769.78] dynamically scales its quality
[5769.78 → 5770.78] depending on the performance
[5770.78 → 5771.50] of your GPU.
[5771.88 → 5772.62] So then,
[5772.72 → 5773.84] if you can't fix
[5773.84 → 5774.64] the
[5774.72 → 5775.92] the load,
[5776.20 → 5776.44] right,
[5776.56 → 5776.70] the
[5776.74 → 5777.20] the game,
[5777.66 → 5777.88] the
[5778.00 → 5778.24] the
[5778.24 → 5779.58] the demandingness
[5779.58 → 5780.20] of the game,
[5780.78 → 5782.08] how can you possibly
[5782.08 → 5783.26] measure the relative
[5783.26 → 5784.34] performance of the hardware
[5784.34 → 5784.90] running it?
[5785.30 → 5786.56] So that's one of the reasons
[5786.56 → 5788.04] that VR benchmarking
[5788.04 → 5788.68] is
[5788.68 → 5790.74] pretty much not a thing.
[5790.74 → 5792.02] like nobody really does it
[5792.02 → 5793.52] because you can't compare it
[5793.52 → 5794.48] unless you're using,
[5794.48 → 5795.20] uh,
[5795.20 → 5796.10] machine vision
[5796.10 → 5798.04] to compare the relative
[5798.04 → 5799.26] downgrading
[5799.26 → 5800.14] of the quality.
[5803.90 → 5805.10] Next question here
[5805.10 → 5806.22] is from Anon.
[5806.86 → 5807.90] What is your opinion
[5807.90 → 5808.86] on employee
[5808.86 → 5809.62] monitoring
[5809.62 → 5810.32] software?
[5811.80 → 5812.28] Um,
[5812.50 → 5813.46] I would,
[5813.58 → 5815.02] I would like to
[5815.02 → 5816.34] imagine that we would
[5816.34 → 5818.02] never feel like
[5818.02 → 5818.74] we needed something
[5818.74 → 5819.24] like that.
[5819.24 → 5820.14] I think if you have
[5820.14 → 5820.60] an employee
[5820.60 → 5821.32] that you feel like
[5821.32 → 5821.94] you need to
[5821.94 → 5823.50] monitor that closely,
[5823.50 → 5824.72] then a better place
[5824.72 → 5825.34] for them might be
[5825.34 → 5826.04] another company.
[5826.88 → 5827.24] Um,
[5827.88 → 5828.22] you know,
[5828.22 → 5829.42] one of my core principles
[5829.42 → 5830.76] is that I never wanna,
[5830.76 → 5831.72] I never want to beg
[5831.72 → 5832.56] anyone to be here.
[5832.72 → 5832.96] You know,
[5833.00 → 5834.04] like I only want people
[5834.04 → 5835.20] here who want to be here.
[5835.40 → 5835.60] So,
[5836.22 → 5837.18] if they are
[5837.18 → 5838.82] not wanting to be here
[5838.82 → 5839.44] enough that their
[5839.44 → 5840.68] performance is a problem
[5840.68 → 5841.38] to the point where
[5841.38 → 5841.92] we have to put
[5841.92 → 5842.74] Big Brother software
[5842.74 → 5843.48] on their computer,
[5843.48 → 5844.32] then I think that
[5844.32 → 5844.92] they might just,
[5845.02 → 5845.60] it might just be time
[5845.60 → 5846.30] for them to move on.
[5849.24 → 5850.06] Next question here
[5850.06 → 5850.78] is from Hollis.
[5851.34 → 5852.14] How many countries
[5852.14 → 5852.66] have you been to?
[5854.64 → 5855.34] I don't know.
[5856.98 → 5857.38] I,
[5857.44 → 5857.80] I could,
[5857.94 → 5858.80] I could try and list them,
[5858.84 → 5859.28] but that would be
[5859.28 → 5860.92] extremely boring content.
[5861.08 → 5861.90] At least 10.
[5862.90 → 5863.24] Okay,
[5863.32 → 5863.46] sure,
[5863.48 → 5863.80] I'll try.
[5864.44 → 5864.80] Canada,
[5865.62 → 5866.14] USA,
[5866.90 → 5867.28] Mexico,
[5867.84 → 5868.70] haven't been anywhere
[5868.70 → 5869.72] in South America yet.
[5869.84 → 5870.70] I have not touched
[5870.70 → 5871.98] the South American continent,
[5872.76 → 5873.22] uh,
[5873.22 → 5874.22] but we'll move over
[5874.22 → 5875.24] to Asia,
[5875.58 → 5876.36] where I have been
[5876.36 → 5877.28] to Singapore,
[5878.14 → 5878.72] Malaysia,
[5879.98 → 5880.66] um,
[5881.42 → 5883.20] Brunei,
[5884.54 → 5885.14] uh,
[5885.26 → 5885.82] Thailand,
[5888.12 → 5888.68] uh,
[5889.24 → 5890.14] China,
[5891.12 → 5891.62] Japan,
[5892.48 → 5892.98] Taiwan.
[5893.70 → 5893.96] Yeah,
[5893.98 → 5894.50] you saw it.
[5895.14 → 5895.56] Uh,
[5895.56 → 5896.26] then if we move
[5896.26 → 5897.42] over to Europe,
[5897.68 → 5899.04] I have been
[5899.04 → 5901.18] to France,
[5902.66 → 5903.10] Germany,
[5903.76 → 5904.34] the UK,
[5905.34 → 5906.04] never Spain.
[5907.34 → 5907.78] Um,
[5908.28 → 5908.94] Belgium.
[5914.10 → 5915.58] Is Luxembourg a country?
[5917.40 → 5918.38] I don't think so.
[5918.86 → 5919.04] Oh,
[5919.20 → 5919.52] Italy,
[5920.66 → 5921.48] Greece,
[5922.10 → 5923.26] so we're at 21 now,
[5923.34 → 5923.70] I think.
[5924.02 → 5924.62] Vatican City,
[5924.72 → 5924.90] I think,
[5924.96 → 5925.92] is technically a country,
[5926.02 → 5926.18] though,
[5926.32 → 5926.80] city-state,
[5926.90 → 5927.40] so I've been there,
[5927.44 → 5928.04] so it's 22.
[5929.62 → 5930.06] Um,
[5930.28 → 5932.72] I think that's it.
[5934.00 → 5934.48] 22.
[5934.92 → 5935.24] I've,
[5935.24 → 5936.22] I've never set foot,
[5936.36 → 5937.10] in Africa,
[5937.30 → 5938.44] never set foot in Australia.
[5939.58 → 5941.08] I think Luxembourg is a country,
[5941.16 → 5943.68] everyone's making fun of the Canadian education system now.
[5944.62 → 5944.88] Well,
[5945.06 → 5945.20] I,
[5945.28 → 5945.74] I,
[5945.74 → 5946.36] I,
[5946.36 → 5947.72] I thought it was.
[5947.72 → 5947.94] Clearly,
[5948.00 → 5948.38] we need to.
[5948.42 → 5948.80] You told me no.
[5949.02 → 5949.72] I need to go,
[5949.86 → 5950.10] clearly.
[5950.36 → 5952.20] I actually don't think I've ever been to Luxembourg anyway,
[5952.28 → 5952.84] I can't remember.
[5954.70 → 5954.90] Uh,
[5954.94 → 5955.08] oh,
[5955.18 → 5955.92] did I say Belgium,
[5956.00 → 5956.16] though?
[5957.42 → 5958.04] Been to Belgium.
[5958.22 → 5958.94] Country so nice,
[5958.96 → 5959.60] he named it twice.
[5961.74 → 5962.02] Rip,
[5962.10 → 5963.36] Luxembourg is a country.
[5963.78 → 5964.06] Oh,
[5964.10 → 5964.22] wait,
[5964.26 → 5964.36] yeah,
[5964.40 → 5964.94] I've been to Korea.
[5965.14 → 5965.38] Sorry,
[5965.52 → 5965.70] yep,
[5965.80 → 5965.98] yep,
[5965.98 → 5966.92] been to Korea as well.
[5967.08 → 5967.52] South Korea,
[5967.60 → 5968.30] not North Korea.
[5968.48 → 5969.60] I saw North Korea.
[5970.06 → 5970.28] I,
[5970.28 → 5971.16] I saw the fence.
[5972.72 → 5973.16] Looked,
[5973.28 → 5974.86] looked out upon North Korea.
[5975.66 → 5975.90] Oh,
[5976.04 → 5976.42] Israel.
[5976.78 → 5977.52] Forgot about Israel.
[5977.70 → 5977.90] Yes,
[5978.04 → 5979.02] been to Israel as well.
[5979.58 → 5979.78] Uh,
[5979.78 → 5980.00] man,
[5980.08 → 5980.54] you guys,
[5980.62 → 5981.76] you guys know better than me.
[5981.76 → 5982.44] Uh,
[5982.44 → 5982.82] no,
[5982.98 → 5984.82] I did not go to Dream Hack Sweden.
[5985.08 → 5987.52] Apparently our green screen worked even better than I thought.
[5987.70 → 5988.04] No,
[5988.10 → 5988.78] that was nonsense.
[5988.98 → 5989.74] I was not there.
[5989.80 → 5990.72] I was on a green screen.
[5991.86 → 5992.22] Oh,
[5992.24 → 5992.70] that's hilarious.
[5993.80 → 5994.20] Um,
[5994.20 → 5995.10] I've been to Texas.
[5996.48 → 5996.84] Well,
[5996.88 → 5997.02] what,
[5997.06 → 5998.40] they think of themselves as their own country,
[5998.46 → 5998.64] right?
[5998.92 → 5999.24] Yeah.
[5999.40 → 6000.62] I guess you've been to Alberta too.
[6000.74 → 6000.90] Yeah,
[6000.94 → 6001.42] I've been to Alberta.
[6003.52 → 6003.88] Um,
[6004.48 → 6005.06] yeah,
[6005.10 → 6005.46] people are,
[6005.52 → 6007.38] people are making jokes already in float plane chat.
[6007.46 → 6007.90] Been to Quebec.
[6008.06 → 6008.18] Yeah,
[6008.24 → 6008.40] yeah,
[6008.40 → 6009.18] I've been to Quebec too.
[6009.18 → 6010.18] Yeah.
[6011.18 → 6012.64] So I guess about 25,
[6012.88 → 6014.02] about 25.
[6014.42 → 6015.26] That's a lot of countries.
[6015.46 → 6015.66] Yeah,
[6015.68 → 6016.26] that's pretty good,
[6016.28 → 6016.50] right?
[6016.78 → 6017.58] I think I'm doing pretty good.
[6017.70 → 6018.76] I don't know how many countries there are,
[6018.82 → 6021.64] but I'm sure that's a lot of them.
[6021.78 → 6022.40] The thing though,
[6022.40 → 6024.12] is I have hardly seen any of it.
[6024.40 → 6025.30] Like it's,
[6025.30 → 6030.70] it's typically airport to hotel to shoot to hotel to airport to leave.
[6031.18 → 6031.86] Like when,
[6032.00 → 6033.48] when I went to Germany one time,
[6033.48 → 6035.94] I forget what the actual number was,
[6036.02 → 6037.44] but it was obscene.
[6037.62 → 6039.08] Like from my doorstep,
[6039.18 → 6041.00] back to my doorstep,
[6041.10 → 6043.20] including a video shoot while I was gone.
[6043.32 → 6046.14] It was something like 56 hours or something like that.
[6046.14 → 6051.16] And when you consider how much of that is on the plane and sleeping and working,
[6052.16 → 6054.30] like it was madness,
[6054.68 → 6055.80] absolute madness.
[6056.28 → 6056.54] Uh,
[6056.54 → 6057.86] that was one of my tightest ones.
[6058.08 → 6062.80] I'd have to go back, and I'd have to go back and like find my ticket to Germany or something like that.
[6062.80 → 6064.98] But it was ridiculous.
[6065.26 → 6066.22] Absolutely ridiculous.
[6066.22 → 6068.16] All right.
[6069.30 → 6070.00] Next one here.
[6070.36 → 6073.06] If you had to work for a big tech company,
[6073.60 → 6074.90] which would you choose?
[6077.18 → 6077.58] Man,
[6077.64 → 6079.72] I don't know if I could work for anybody anymore.
[6080.10 → 6080.46] I,
[6080.58 → 6083.48] I realized this watching a behind the scenes on float plane.
[6083.68 → 6084.12] Uh,
[6084.12 → 6086.06] did you watch the one with the
[6086.06 → 6086.52] um,
[6087.68 → 6090.80] for the intro to the star forge systems build?
[6092.14 → 6092.58] Uh,
[6092.64 → 6092.90] with the
[6092.90 → 6093.82] with the escalade.
[6094.18 → 6094.84] Oh yeah.
[6094.96 → 6095.12] Yeah.
[6095.12 → 6095.28] Yeah.
[6095.34 → 6095.74] Okay.
[6096.08 → 6098.04] I was watching that and nobody,
[6098.20 → 6100.04] nobody really called me on it or,
[6100.14 → 6101.96] or criticized it or anything like that,
[6101.96 → 6103.24] but I was watching it.
[6103.28 → 6109.62] And what I realized is I ask a lot less these days than I used to.
[6109.80 → 6113.64] And I tell a lot more.
[6114.26 → 6115.56] And I'm,
[6115.56 → 6115.84] you know,
[6115.84 → 6116.34] I'm not gonna,
[6116.40 → 6117.84] I'm not going to apologize for it.
[6117.86 → 6118.24] It's,
[6118.38 → 6119.26] it's part of,
[6119.40 → 6122.56] it's part of managing a team of people and getting things done.
[6123.52 → 6124.12] But I,
[6124.12 → 6124.40] I,
[6124.58 → 6126.18] I definitely tend to say,
[6126.30 → 6126.98] okay,
[6127.00 → 6127.48] you over there,
[6127.56 → 6128.12] you over there,
[6128.50 → 6129.00] do that.
[6129.16 → 6129.68] Let's go.
[6129.80 → 6129.96] Like,
[6130.02 → 6130.90] and,
[6131.00 → 6133.68] and I think part of that is just being a busy person and having to get
[6133.68 → 6134.24] things done.
[6134.24 → 6134.60] And I'm,
[6134.66 → 6135.54] it's not like I don't,
[6135.58 → 6136.20] I don't think,
[6136.60 → 6136.82] you know,
[6136.82 → 6137.10] I was just,
[6137.10 → 6140.16] I was watching myself from kind of like an outside perspective.
[6140.16 → 6140.42] Right.
[6140.46 → 6140.86] And I,
[6141.04 → 6144.82] I didn't think I was rude or disrespectful or,
[6144.82 → 6145.94] or anything like that,
[6145.94 → 6150.58] but I have definitely grown accustomed to being in charge.
[6150.58 → 6153.28] And I just don't know how I,
[6153.36 → 6154.84] I don't know how I would handle it anymore.
[6156.14 → 6156.58] Um,
[6156.76 → 6157.80] I think that,
[6157.98 → 6159.58] I think that it could be really cool.
[6159.70 → 6161.98] I don't think I would like to work in total secrecy.
[6162.16 → 6163.72] I think the way that Apple,
[6163.72 → 6164.48] um,
[6165.00 → 6168.58] sort of obfuscates what people are working on is super uncool.
[6168.76 → 6172.04] I don't really understand why people tolerate that.
[6172.46 → 6172.90] Um,
[6172.96 → 6176.84] because the only reason for Apple to do that is so that they can hide away
[6176.84 → 6179.34] that you work at Apple and the cool stuff that you're doing so that
[6179.34 → 6180.40] you're not as poachable.
[6180.58 → 6181.44] Just like,
[6182.04 → 6182.72] you,
[6183.08 → 6183.40] um,
[6183.68 → 6186.16] just about the only response I can think of to that.
[6187.08 → 6187.46] There's,
[6187.56 → 6189.40] there's definitely more transparent companies.
[6189.40 → 6192.92] I think some of the skunk work stuff that they do at a place like Google is
[6192.92 → 6193.54] pretty sick.
[6194.44 → 6195.28] Like what are the other,
[6195.36 → 6195.92] what are the other big,
[6196.08 → 6196.76] big tech companies?
[6196.86 → 6199.70] I would have absolutely nothing to contribute to someone like a Netflix.
[6199.96 → 6201.76] I have no traditional production experience.
[6201.94 → 6202.42] And Fang.
[6202.60 → 6203.26] So you got Facebook.
[6203.44 → 6203.64] I don't,
[6203.66 → 6204.56] I don't see how I would.
[6204.72 → 6204.80] Well,
[6204.80 → 6206.46] even if you lower the stakes to like Asus,
[6206.74 → 6207.32] VGA.
[6207.94 → 6208.30] Oh,
[6208.44 → 6208.64] Oh,
[6208.64 → 6209.50] like it,
[6210.14 → 6210.66] you know,
[6211.10 → 6213.16] I think it'd be kind of fun to work for Silverstone.
[6213.74 → 6216.56] That's a company that does a lot of cool stuff,
[6216.56 → 6219.00] but has absolutely no idea whatsoever,
[6219.00 → 6220.78] how to market themselves.
[6220.78 → 6223.26] And I think that I could be perfect in a role like that.
[6223.94 → 6224.30] Um,
[6224.40 → 6226.90] yeah,
[6227.04 → 6227.30] sure.
[6227.50 → 6227.70] Yeah,
[6227.72 → 6227.92] sure.
[6228.20 → 6228.56] Silverstone.
[6228.98 → 6229.32] Yeah.
[6229.38 → 6230.22] Silverstone is pretty chill.
[6230.92 → 6232.58] I feel like we're almost big tech now.
[6232.92 → 6233.64] We're almost there.
[6233.76 → 6234.22] You don't have to.
[6234.24 → 6234.66] We're not.
[6235.12 → 6236.14] We've got 80 people,
[6236.24 → 6237.78] not 8,000 people.
[6238.20 → 6238.94] Give it a year or two.
[6239.24 → 6239.76] You know what?
[6239.98 → 6242.36] That project I did down at Supermicro was really fun.
[6242.42 → 6243.18] They seem pretty cool.
[6243.18 → 6243.68] Hmm.
[6245.90 → 6246.22] Uh,
[6246.22 → 6248.68] next question here is from Tristan.
[6249.96 → 6254.08] What sites or services do you miss from years past that aren't around anymore?
[6254.20 → 6255.80] Like Vine with Twitter.
[6256.46 → 6257.06] Oh man,
[6257.18 → 6258.74] I talked about this in my,
[6258.86 → 6261.26] in my Metaverse Quest Pro video.
[6261.44 → 6262.46] The Palace.
[6262.46 → 6266.24] I actually had the founder of The Palace reach out on Twitter.
[6268.22 → 6268.74] Uh,
[6268.80 → 6271.38] confirmed that there is no VR Palace coming,
[6271.48 → 6274.98] but The Palace was basically Habbo Hotel before Habbo Hotel was a thing.
[6275.12 → 6276.84] It's kind of like a graphical,
[6276.84 → 6277.46] uh,
[6278.28 → 6278.82] IRC,
[6279.00 → 6279.86] graphical chat room.
[6280.22 → 6285.56] And it had a lot of the same features that like a Metaverse VR chat style thing
[6285.56 → 6288.58] might have where you can only talk to people who are near you.
[6288.66 → 6289.72] So you could whisper to each other.
[6289.80 → 6291.76] You could broadcast to a small group around you.
[6291.88 → 6295.80] So you would actually like move around in rooms to be near people who are talking about
[6295.80 → 6297.26] the same things you might want to talk about.
[6297.76 → 6297.98] Uh,
[6297.98 → 6298.26] but I,
[6298.34 → 6298.50] yeah,
[6298.50 → 6299.70] I spent a ton of my,
[6299.96 → 6301.60] ton of my youth on The Palace.
[6302.04 → 6302.22] Um,
[6302.26 → 6304.34] MSN Messenger is another huge one.
[6304.56 → 6305.64] I don't know what it was.
[6305.72 → 6305.90] I,
[6305.96 → 6307.30] I would use it again today.
[6307.30 → 6307.98] It's just,
[6308.74 → 6314.56] it's so much better than a lot of the chat apps that we have now.
[6314.56 → 6316.18] And it was so far ahead of its time.
[6316.18 → 6317.22] Like the ability to,
[6317.54 → 6318.66] even the ability to,
[6318.66 → 6319.04] uh,
[6319.04 → 6319.86] turn on a webcam,
[6320.46 → 6324.64] like have video in your chat was like really cool at the time.
[6324.68 → 6325.98] There might've been something that did it first,
[6326.08 → 6327.60] but MSN did it pretty well.
[6328.16 → 6328.48] Um,
[6328.50 → 6329.24] there's a super,
[6329.34 → 6329.54] man,
[6329.66 → 6331.76] when you used to be able to have like custom animated,
[6332.32 → 6332.68] um,
[6333.16 → 6334.72] I guess they would be emoticons,
[6334.84 → 6335.70] not emojis,
[6336.28 → 6338.42] or which ones which I can never remember.
[6338.58 → 6341.30] But the point is there was this super cool one that was like a little,
[6341.30 → 6345.46] a little smiley face and an unsuspecting pink smiley face.
[6345.46 → 6348.76] And he comes up, and he goes like this and then gives it a hug.
[6348.76 → 6349.88] And then there's like a little heart.
[6350.00 → 6353.42] Like there was just like really fun ways to express yourself that,
[6353.94 → 6354.24] you know,
[6354.28 → 6354.40] I,
[6354.68 → 6354.84] you know,
[6354.84 → 6356.92] there are really fun ways to express yourselves now.
[6356.92 → 6358.92] Like you couldn't send each other GIFs back in the day.
[6359.24 → 6359.58] Uh,
[6359.58 → 6362.18] but maybe you could actually try to remember.
[6362.38 → 6362.78] Uh,
[6362.82 → 6366.28] but it had fun ways to express yourself that I feel like if you brought them
[6366.28 → 6366.86] back,
[6366.86 → 6367.66] uh,
[6367.66 → 6369.82] might seem innovative and seem novel today.
[6370.92 → 6371.32] Yeah.
[6371.36 → 6374.26] I miss nudging people to shaking that window violently.
[6374.96 → 6375.40] Yeah.
[6375.40 → 6375.82] Like,
[6375.86 → 6375.90] Hey,
[6375.92 → 6376.60] are you still there?
[6377.34 → 6379.18] And just abusing that whenever possible.
[6379.38 → 6379.70] Yeah.
[6380.00 → 6380.18] Oh,
[6380.22 → 6380.44] you can.
[6380.48 → 6382.18] And then they turned on the ability to disable,
[6382.30 → 6383.44] to disable nudges.
[6383.60 → 6384.24] Like it just,
[6384.56 → 6384.76] man,
[6384.78 → 6386.16] it was so feature complete.
[6386.16 → 6387.96] The ability to go offline mode,
[6388.22 → 6389.56] offline to certain people.
[6389.56 → 6390.56] Offline was amazing.
[6390.88 → 6390.94] Like,
[6391.00 → 6391.62] man.
[6391.90 → 6392.02] Yeah.
[6392.04 → 6394.02] I remember when pure offline was such a
[6394.02 → 6394.78] such an innovation.
[6395.94 → 6396.34] Um,
[6396.86 → 6397.80] okay.
[6397.98 → 6399.48] Emoticons are made of letters or symbols.
[6399.62 → 6401.04] Emoji are the ones that are little pictures,
[6401.14 → 6401.88] but it's animated,
[6402.22 → 6403.10] animated emojis.
[6403.22 → 6403.58] So whatever,
[6403.76 → 6404.20] whatever that.
[6404.28 → 6405.18] It's like pre discord.
[6405.30 → 6406.76] You could like upload your own.
[6407.20 → 6407.26] Uh,
[6407.26 → 6407.34] well,
[6407.36 → 6407.44] yeah,
[6407.44 → 6407.78] it was cool.
[6408.52 → 6408.74] Uh,
[6408.74 → 6409.20] it was awesome,
[6409.28 → 6409.38] man.
[6409.38 → 6414.38] I would use the crap out of just them bringing back MSN messenger.
[6415.50 → 6418.28] My choice with no further explanation is just downtown.
[6418.28 → 6419.40] Bring back downtown.
[6420.26 → 6420.70] Downtown.
[6420.86 → 6422.38] The like Disney MMO.
[6422.60 → 6423.84] Isn't that still a thing?
[6424.20 → 6424.42] Well,
[6424.46 → 6424.90] there was,
[6425.02 → 6426.14] I think they got cease and desist.
[6426.14 → 6426.76] Uh,
[6426.76 → 6427.38] because they like,
[6427.46 → 6427.82] it was,
[6428.02 → 6428.88] I can't remember what they called it,
[6428.94 → 6430.08] but it was like a revamped one.
[6430.34 → 6430.56] No,
[6430.62 → 6431.36] downtown rewritten.
[6431.48 → 6432.16] Hold on a second.
[6433.80 → 6434.16] Oh,
[6434.48 → 6435.48] looks like you're new here.
[6435.66 → 6436.06] Uh,
[6436.24 → 6437.18] I want to leave.
[6437.34 → 6438.28] What a choice.
[6438.84 → 6440.14] I want to leave.
[6441.64 → 6443.28] Downtown is completely free.
[6443.28 → 6443.52] Oh,
[6443.52 → 6443.72] wow.
[6443.72 → 6444.30] So they actually,
[6444.50 → 6446.54] they didn't get a season's assist.
[6446.64 → 6447.16] That's amazing.
[6447.30 → 6447.48] Wait.
[6447.86 → 6448.10] Oh,
[6448.38 → 6449.02] did you click?
[6449.14 → 6449.64] I want to leave.
[6450.60 → 6451.04] What?
[6451.70 → 6451.90] Yeah.
[6451.90 → 6452.56] It sounds good.
[6452.68 → 6456.28] Disney's downtown online created using publicly available downloads and information.
[6456.48 → 6461.54] You understand it is not affiliated with the Walt Disney company or Disney interactive group.
[6461.76 → 6462.10] Sure.
[6463.18 → 6463.62] Okay.
[6464.62 → 6465.64] Downtown rewritten.
[6465.98 → 6466.42] Wow.
[6466.68 → 6467.24] Here it is.
[6467.32 → 6468.10] That's amazing.
[6468.90 → 6470.20] I remember throwing pies at people.
[6470.50 → 6470.78] Uh,
[6470.78 → 6471.18] like it was,
[6471.18 → 6472.12] it was a great game.
[6472.16 → 6472.58] Oh man.
[6472.62 → 6472.88] I never played it.
[6472.88 → 6473.50] Just walking around.
[6473.92 → 6474.14] Uh,
[6474.14 → 6477.24] there was a really cool tank game that I've talked about on WAN show before,
[6477.24 → 6480.54] but no one's ever been able to tell me what it was called.
[6480.70 → 6481.14] Uh,
[6481.16 → 6486.56] but it was like a top-down tank game that you would spawn in completely like fresh.
[6486.70 → 6487.78] It had permanent,
[6488.06 → 6489.12] which was really cool.
[6489.28 → 6491.18] So you would come in and,
[6491.60 → 6491.86] uh,
[6491.88 → 6493.76] I forget if it was like mouse based movement,
[6493.76 → 6496.32] but going from one area to another,
[6496.42 → 6499.10] was like a complete sort of reload.
[6499.22 → 6501.06] So you would go to the edge of the screen, and you would go,
[6501.32 → 6506.04] you would appear at the bottom of like the next screen, and you would level up by
[6506.04 → 6509.26] defeating other tanks and get more and more powerful,
[6509.26 → 6510.70] but death was permanent.
[6510.88 → 6513.44] So if you were like levelled up to level four or whatever,
[6513.44 → 6517.50] and walked into two level threes that messed you up,
[6517.52 → 6517.98] that was it.
[6518.02 → 6518.48] You were dead.
[6518.68 → 6522.20] And I just don't remember what it was called.
[6522.20 → 6523.00] Tank trouble.
[6523.10 → 6523.62] People are saying,
[6523.86 → 6523.98] no,
[6524.08 → 6526.00] it was not called tank trouble for sure.
[6526.42 → 6527.60] Um,
[6527.68 → 6528.88] was it just called tanks?
[6529.36 → 6530.52] It was just tanks.
[6530.62 → 6531.26] The flash game.
[6531.38 → 6531.72] Hold on.
[6531.92 → 6533.10] Are you able to Google that?
[6533.22 → 6534.72] Just Google tank flash game?
[6538.02 → 6538.38] Um,
[6538.58 → 6539.34] scorched earth.
[6541.18 → 6541.58] No,
[6542.14 → 6542.52] no,
[6542.58 → 6543.40] it wasn't pocket tanks.
[6543.48 → 6545.22] No pocket tanks is side view.
[6545.22 → 6545.96] It was top down.
[6549.20 → 6549.68] Uh,
[6549.68 → 6550.64] I don't see,
[6550.84 → 6551.92] I don't think it's tanks.
[6552.02 → 6552.26] I don't,
[6552.32 → 6554.26] I don't see anything here that looks like the right thing.
[6554.32 → 6554.48] Oh,
[6555.54 → 6556.14] no.
[6556.28 → 6556.98] Thank you online.
[6557.54 → 6561.40] I would say the closest looking thing that I've seen so far,
[6561.56 → 6564.36] this is apparently called world of tanks for Sega Genesis,
[6564.36 → 6566.82] but the tanks looked more cartoon.
[6568.02 → 6568.92] So that's,
[6568.98 → 6570.48] that's definitely not it.
[6570.70 → 6572.48] It was not 3d like this.
[6573.62 → 6574.14] Uh,
[6574.18 → 6574.36] it was,
[6574.48 → 6575.52] it was very,
[6575.64 → 6576.74] very 2d.
[6579.42 → 6579.86] Yeah.
[6580.00 → 6580.40] Am I just,
[6580.48 → 6580.66] I've,
[6580.74 → 6582.18] I've never been able to find it again.
[6582.26 → 6584.12] I swear it was pretty big.
[6584.84 → 6586.96] Like lots of people were playing it.
[6587.26 → 6588.36] So I don't really,
[6588.54 → 6591.00] I don't really know why it's so hard to find.
[6591.20 → 6591.42] No,
[6591.42 → 6592.32] it wasn't on Wii guys.
[6592.42 → 6593.22] It's a browser game.
[6593.34 → 6593.92] It was on PC.
[6594.60 → 6594.72] Yeah.
[6594.72 → 6595.66] A lot of people remember it,
[6595.68 → 6596.40] but just don't know the name.
[6597.20 → 6597.68] Oh really?
[6597.92 → 6598.14] Yeah.
[6598.14 → 6598.84] A lot of people are saying,
[6598.92 → 6600.94] I remember, and they're trying to,
[6601.00 → 6601.96] trying to name it.
[6602.62 → 6602.98] Yeah.
[6603.00 → 6605.72] I just completely don't remember what it was called.
[6606.64 → 6608.66] Like it was kind of like this,
[6608.94 → 6610.88] but that's definitely not it.
[6611.34 → 6611.78] Uh,
[6611.78 → 6613.30] the tanks were more kind of like,
[6613.36 → 6615.36] I think they were like more rounded looking,
[6616.02 → 6617.00] like kind of cartoon.
[6617.24 → 6618.72] I know that when you,
[6618.90 → 6619.68] when you shot,
[6619.94 → 6620.98] when you shot at people,
[6620.98 → 6622.04] it was like,
[6622.10 → 6623.12] there was like a cool down.
[6623.20 → 6626.00] Like it wasn't just however fast you could press the space bar or
[6626.00 → 6626.30] whatever.
[6627.84 → 6628.20] Um,
[6629.26 → 6630.28] bubble tanks.
[6630.36 → 6630.90] Is that it?
[6632.76 → 6633.74] What's bubble tanks?
[6634.56 → 6634.92] No,
[6635.28 → 6635.48] no,
[6635.54 → 6635.64] no,
[6635.64 → 6635.78] no,
[6635.78 → 6635.94] no,
[6635.94 → 6636.12] no,
[6636.12 → 6636.66] not even,
[6636.66 → 6636.94] yeah,
[6637.00 → 6637.74] not even close.
[6638.56 → 6640.24] No wrong answers except for that one.
[6640.44 → 6642.06] What's a solo tank game.
[6642.18 → 6643.22] That doesn't sound familiar.
[6644.04 → 6644.36] Um,
[6644.52 → 6645.14] battle city.
[6645.30 → 6645.48] No,
[6645.54 → 6645.66] no,
[6645.68 → 6646.30] it's nothing like that.
[6646.36 → 6646.84] It was 2d.
[6646.96 → 6648.36] It was a web game guys.
[6648.42 → 6649.32] It was a web game.
[6650.98 → 6651.42] Yeah.
[6651.42 → 6651.88] I don't know.
[6651.92 → 6652.76] It's so frustrating.
[6652.76 → 6653.32] Like it's,
[6653.62 → 6659.92] it seems to have completely disappeared from our collective consciousness.
[6659.92 → 6662.04] Like doesn't exist anymore.
[6665.04 → 6665.96] Battle city.
[6667.64 → 6668.08] No,
[6668.94 → 6669.20] no,
[6669.20 → 6672.48] it was a browser based guys browser based.
[6673.32 → 6675.48] It's not many tank games are,
[6675.74 → 6676.42] this is wild.
[6676.60 → 6677.08] I know,
[6677.12 → 6677.30] right?
[6677.30 → 6678.18] Love tanks.
[6678.46 → 6679.22] Don't they?
[6679.66 → 6680.10] Uh,
[6680.14 → 6680.48] no,
[6680.60 → 6681.34] not this.
[6683.20 → 6683.64] Yeah,
[6683.68 → 6683.86] it's,
[6683.86 → 6684.58] it's none of these.
[6684.90 → 6685.94] Just a mini golf game.
[6686.04 → 6686.78] I don't think that's it.
[6687.52 → 6687.96] Yeah,
[6687.96 → 6689.46] I really don't think that's it.
[6689.74 → 6690.86] Pocket tanks is super cool.
[6690.96 → 6692.60] That is another game that I really enjoyed.
[6692.60 → 6693.00] Um,
[6693.36 → 6695.96] Yvonne and I used to play that all the time.
[6696.32 → 6699.18] Just like having like a do nothing day.
[6699.82 → 6700.26] Um,
[6700.26 → 6701.52] just like playing pocket tanks.
[6703.26 → 6703.62] Uh,
[6703.84 → 6706.42] was it on penny arcade?
[6706.58 → 6706.82] No,
[6706.88 → 6707.86] I don't think so.
[6708.10 → 6708.62] Tank tips.
[6708.74 → 6709.42] I wouldn't know though.
[6709.46 → 6711.48] I didn't really like to follow them closely or anything.
[6712.20 → 6712.64] Uh,
[6712.70 → 6712.88] yes,
[6712.96 → 6713.08] too.
[6713.14 → 6713.92] That's not a good start.
[6714.80 → 6715.72] That'll tank shock.
[6715.80 → 6716.80] So you can destroy a game.
[6716.98 → 6717.02] Well,
[6717.08 → 6717.18] no,
[6717.22 → 6718.04] this is PS2.
[6718.14 → 6718.30] Yeah.
[6719.30 → 6720.20] No guys.
[6721.76 → 6722.40] So you can destroy again.
[6722.42 → 6722.52] Oh,
[6722.52 → 6723.54] did I already search for this one?
[6724.38 → 6724.72] No,
[6724.82 → 6726.20] not seek and destroy man.
[6726.28 → 6727.04] We are not gonna,
[6727.18 → 6729.92] we're not going to find this tank cannons.
[6730.00 → 6731.30] Are you guys just making things up?
[6732.26 → 6733.32] Someone said try Bing.
[6733.56 → 6734.40] That's probably the
[6734.54 → 6735.78] it's the Google suppression.
[6737.54 → 6737.94] Yeah.
[6738.02 → 6738.28] You know,
[6738.34 → 6743.04] it's actually not a terrible idea because sometimes it's not like suppression,
[6743.04 → 6744.82] but Google just ends up in like a
[6744.96 → 6744.98] Hey,
[6745.00 → 6746.36] this is the most likely thing.
[6746.50 → 6746.66] So,
[6746.66 → 6747.88] uh,
[6747.88 → 6748.24] all right,
[6748.38 → 6749.20] let's go.
[6750.42 → 6750.86] Uh,
[6750.96 → 6755.28] top down browser tank game,
[6755.28 → 6756.50] early two thousands.
[6756.76 → 6757.12] Okay.
[6757.24 → 6757.50] There,
[6757.96 → 6760.08] let's give this as much help.
[6760.76 → 6762.42] I'm an old 3d flash game.
[6762.50 → 6762.86] It was probably,
[6763.12 → 6766.28] but from what I remember is a 3d tank game where you needed to take consumable.
[6766.28 → 6767.10] Hold on a second.
[6767.50 → 6769.88] Where you needed to take consumable ammo shield,
[6769.96 → 6770.30] health speed,
[6770.38 → 6770.84] damage buff,
[6770.88 → 6773.04] and your tank changed colour depending on what you had.
[6773.60 → 6774.90] Basic tank shell and artillery.
[6775.32 → 6777.70] Direct hit online game with no bots at all.
[6777.88 → 6778.64] You had rank.
[6779.42 → 6780.64] And depending on,
[6780.82 → 6781.04] okay,
[6781.14 → 6781.30] this,
[6781.94 → 6784.88] the game was 100% multiplayer online on a web browser.
[6785.08 → 6787.24] I think this person is looking for the same game.
[6788.94 → 6789.46] Oh no.
[6789.54 → 6791.28] They say it was a realistic looking game.
[6792.04 → 6792.34] Hmm.
[6792.34 → 6792.74] No.
[6794.58 → 6794.94] Uh,
[6794.94 → 6795.02] uh,
[6795.02 → 6795.52] uh,
[6795.52 → 6797.06] oh no,
[6797.14 → 6797.30] no,
[6797.34 → 6798.12] it wasn't,
[6798.12 → 6798.44] no,
[6798.54 → 6799.52] it wasn't three-dimensional.
[6799.78 → 6800.00] Nope.
[6800.04 → 6800.26] Never mind.
[6800.32 → 6801.68] They're probably looking for a different thing.
[6803.04 → 6803.40] Oh,
[6803.68 → 6804.82] well that was worth a shot.
[6804.90 → 6805.12] Okay.
[6805.14 → 6805.98] Let's go back to Bing.
[6808.36 → 6808.76] Uh,
[6808.80 → 6809.08] let's,
[6809.18 → 6810.08] let's see images.
[6810.88 → 6812.00] What are the odds here?
[6813.46 → 6813.82] No,
[6813.94 → 6814.82] I don't see it.
[6815.64 → 6816.86] It's not battle city.
[6817.46 → 6817.86] No,
[6818.00 → 6818.22] no,
[6818.36 → 6818.58] no.
[6818.68 → 6818.84] Yeah.
[6818.92 → 6819.28] I,
[6819.28 → 6819.30] I,
[6819.36 → 6820.60] I think I've given up.
[6820.98 → 6823.52] I don't think I am ever going to find this,
[6823.58 → 6828.68] which is just wild to me because I know a lot of other people played it because I would
[6828.68 → 6833.80] go on anytime night or day, and it would be absolutely full of people playing.
[6833.80 → 6834.00] Okay.
[6834.00 → 6834.34] This looks,
[6834.44 → 6834.66] it could be,
[6834.74 → 6835.54] is it tank pit?
[6836.20 → 6837.14] I don't think so.
[6837.26 → 6838.16] That doesn't sound familiar.
[6838.26 → 6838.72] In one word?
[6839.70 → 6840.28] Tank pit.
[6841.06 → 6841.78] The graphics,
[6841.98 → 6842.32] I mean,
[6842.58 → 6845.02] it just looks older,
[6845.20 → 6845.98] kind of scroll.
[6846.12 → 6846.62] Tank pit.
[6847.32 → 6847.96] Hold on.
[6848.40 → 6848.80] Wait,
[6848.98 → 6849.72] is this it?
[6851.56 → 6852.50] This might be it.
[6855.18 → 6856.22] Is it tank pit?
[6857.16 → 6857.60] Hold on.
[6857.60 → 6858.14] multiplayer tank game.

[6871.20 → 6872.52] Did we find it?
[6872.64 → 6873.40] Is it a jackal?
[6873.60 → 6874.08] Jackal?
[6874.18 → 6874.92] Is it a jackal?
[6875.30 → 6875.78] Oh,
[6876.18 → 6877.38] I think this is it.
[6877.78 → 6878.22] Yes.
[6878.48 → 6879.24] Shout out chat.
[6879.72 → 6879.98] Who,
[6880.04 → 6880.70] who got it?

[6882.74 → 6883.20] I'm not sure.
[6883.38 → 6885.08] I think the first one I saw was from.
[6887.28 → 6887.64] Wash.

[6971.96 → 6972.18] Yeah.

[6974.32 → 6975.66] We finally found it.
[6976.02 → 6976.26] Okay.

[6992.68 → 6993.08] Boom.

[7079.82 → 7080.84] More threads.
[7081.04 → 7081.32] Hello.

[7090.78 → 7091.82] if I can get my hands on it,
[7091.86 → 7092.78] I'd love to,
[7092.88 → 7094.44] but we've had a heck of our time.
[7094.62 → 7097.78] We're getting our hands on like weird Chinese GPUs.
[7098.42 → 7101.66] And just like weird Chinese tech in general in the past.
[7102.32 → 7103.62] PCIe Gen 5.
[7104.04 → 7105.44] What am I even looking at here?
[7106.40 → 7107.08] 16 gigs,

[7112.94 → 7113.10] I'll,
[7113.16 → 7114.42] I'll send this over to Andy.

[7115.54 → 7117.14] if we can get something from China,
[7117.54 → 7117.90] uh,
[7117.92 → 7119.34] Andy's usually my guy.
[7121.94 → 7122.42] Uh,
[7122.42 → 7123.70] next one here from PA.
[7124.04 → 7126.32] Can you give some more relationship advice?
[7126.32 → 7129.10] I remember mentioning that you and your wife commit not to go into bed,
[7129.14 → 7129.70] angry or sad,
[7129.72 → 7130.38] and it was really helpful.
[7132.30 → 7132.62] Um,
[7133.10 → 7133.64] oh man,
[7133.66 → 7134.16] that's tough.
[7136.38 → 7136.74] Uh,
[7136.74 → 7137.06] hold on.
[7137.10 → 7138.36] I got to send this to Andy real quick.
[7138.36 → 7138.88] Andy message.
[7139.00 → 7139.50] I don't think of that.
[7139.72 → 7140.08] Um,
[7140.44 → 7141.40] I don't know.
[7141.60 → 7141.96] I,
[7141.96 → 7144.14] I kind of put me on the spot here.
[7144.18 → 7145.48] If you're asking something specific,
[7145.48 → 7145.92] then,
[7145.96 → 7146.48] you know,
[7146.48 → 7147.18] I'd be happy to,
[7147.24 → 7148.88] but it's not like we have all the answers.
[7148.88 → 7149.70] I think that,
[7149.82 → 7150.14] um,
[7150.30 → 7150.64] I don't know.
[7150.66 → 7152.70] I had a perfect bit of advice for someone recently.
[7152.70 → 7154.22] So maybe I'll just reiterate that one.
[7154.22 → 7155.02] Uh,
[7155.20 → 7157.58] buddy was asking like my,
[7157.78 → 7159.16] my wife or SO or whatever,
[7159.16 → 7162.04] always insists that I not buy her stuff,
[7162.04 → 7162.94] but you know,
[7162.94 → 7164.50] I really like giving gifts.
[7164.50 → 7164.92] So like,
[7164.96 → 7165.84] what should I buy her?
[7165.98 → 7166.48] And I was like,
[7166.48 → 7167.38] you should listen to her.
[7167.62 → 7169.02] And they followed me,
[7169.20 → 7170.20] followed up with me later.
[7170.22 → 7170.58] They were like,
[7170.60 → 7171.66] that was perfect advice.
[7171.66 → 7172.20] And I was like,
[7172.24 → 7172.50] yeah.
[7173.56 → 7174.20] So that's,
[7174.28 → 7174.94] that's a good one.
[7175.30 → 7176.16] Listen to your wife.
[7176.40 → 7176.62] Yeah.
[7176.62 → 7177.22] That's a good tip.
[7177.34 → 7177.56] Yeah.
[7178.08 → 7178.30] Yeah.
[7178.30 → 7178.90] For real though.
[7178.90 → 7180.68] You know,
[7180.72 → 7183.28] a lot of what people need in a relationship,
[7183.46 → 7184.24] they're telling you,
[7185.24 → 7185.58] you know,
[7186.18 → 7186.76] you just gotta,
[7187.26 → 7188.48] you have to,
[7188.62 → 7190.46] you have to engage with people on their own terms.
[7191.12 → 7193.72] At the funniest exchange with Luke the other day,
[7194.04 → 7194.58] um,
[7194.88 → 7200.28] I saw a notification for like his birthday, and it's less than a year away.
[7200.68 → 7201.82] And I was like,
[7202.54 → 7202.86] yo,
[7203.00 → 7204.00] I saw your birthday.
[7204.40 → 7204.80] Um,
[7204.90 → 7205.60] happy birthday.
[7205.60 → 7206.10] Cause like,
[7206.10 → 7208.54] I'm probably going to forget on the day I didn't get you anything.
[7209.02 → 7209.62] And he's like,
[7209.68 → 7210.08] thanks bro.
[7210.78 → 7212.00] Cause that works for us.
[7212.52 → 7215.46] Neither of us likes the pressure of reciprocating gifts.
[7215.82 → 7219.02] So it's so much better if we just don't get each other anything.
[7219.72 → 7220.06] Um,
[7220.80 → 7221.26] so yeah,
[7221.26 → 7221.58] it's just,
[7221.64 → 7222.96] it's all about different,
[7223.08 → 7224.12] different rules for everyone.
[7226.26 → 7226.66] Totally.
[7227.46 → 7228.68] Question here from Greg.
[7229.14 → 7233.82] What's a bad habit you didn't know you had till Yvonne broke the bad news to you?
[7236.10 → 7238.38] Or somebody close to you?
[7239.98 → 7240.42] Man.
[7241.22 → 7241.58] Uh,
[7242.14 → 7243.82] bad habit.
[7245.18 → 7245.86] I mean,
[7245.98 → 7246.26] yeah,
[7246.38 → 7246.82] I'm like,
[7247.00 → 7250.20] I didn't realize.
[7250.28 → 7250.40] No,
[7250.46 → 7252.50] I pretty much knew that I was an idiot.
[7253.48 → 7253.82] Um,
[7254.52 → 7254.96] I'm not,
[7254.96 → 7255.26] like,
[7255.26 → 7256.24] I'm not saying that like,
[7256.30 → 7258.70] that makes me some kind of like genius or that there,
[7258.86 → 7259.18] you know,
[7259.18 → 7260.64] there was nothing wrong with me or anything.
[7260.64 → 7261.34] It's just like,
[7261.34 → 7261.52] no,
[7261.58 → 7266.10] I like was pretty aware that I was not super functional,
[7266.30 → 7267.44] especially back when she met me.
[7269.74 → 7270.14] Yeah.
[7270.18 → 7270.52] Sorry.
[7270.64 → 7271.28] I got nothing.
[7272.40 → 7272.80] Linus.
[7272.94 → 7273.90] You're just so aware.
[7274.14 → 7275.18] That's what we love about you,
[7275.20 → 7275.40] right?
[7276.10 → 7276.34] Yeah.
[7276.38 → 7277.14] I'm not too aware.
[7277.26 → 7279.14] So I'm just one where I'm aware.
[7280.36 → 7281.34] Question here from Merrick.
[7281.80 → 7286.32] Do you think that if everybody had somehow forgotten about LTT or the channel disappeared,
[7286.32 → 7290.96] you could build up another YouTube channel to the size that LTT is now?
[7291.04 → 7292.08] I've wondered that a lot.
[7292.16 → 7293.68] I think it would be a really fun challenge.
[7294.06 → 7296.92] I know there was another big YouTuber who did it not that long ago,
[7297.44 → 7297.68] uh,
[7297.68 → 7299.14] or streamer or something like that.
[7299.36 → 7299.90] Did Ludwig do it?
[7299.92 → 7300.44] There you go.
[7300.54 → 7300.94] There you go.
[7301.04 → 7301.80] That must've been him.
[7302.26 → 7302.70] Uh,
[7302.74 → 7303.36] but it's like,
[7303.36 → 7304.16] it's impossible.
[7304.72 → 7307.30] It's impossible to actually attempt it.
[7307.70 → 7308.06] Like,
[7308.12 → 7308.94] here's an example.
[7310.24 → 7315.52] Supermicro uploaded the videos that I filmed for them while I was down there last week,
[7315.68 → 7316.24] two weeks ago.
[7316.32 → 7317.42] I don't remember when I was there,
[7317.60 → 7318.96] but I was down there at some point.
[7319.40 → 7319.56] Uh,
[7319.56 → 7324.80] they uploaded these videos to their channel and just having,
[7325.02 → 7325.54] you know,
[7326.12 → 7327.10] me in the thumbnail,
[7327.66 → 7330.56] these videos are all doing way more views than,
[7330.64 → 7331.14] you know,
[7331.32 → 7335.20] anything else that they upload other than the videos that they pay to run as ads.
[7335.68 → 7337.06] So even like,
[7337.06 → 7338.80] I'd have to not put myself in the thumbnail,
[7338.94 → 7340.34] but then if I was in the video,
[7340.42 → 7342.82] so maybe if I tried to do like a
[7342.86 → 7343.88] like a faceless channel,
[7344.06 → 7346.12] like a behind the camera channel or something like that.
[7346.12 → 7346.28] Yeah,
[7346.28 → 7346.56] I could,
[7346.60 → 7347.44] I could try to do it,
[7347.48 → 7352.48] but I think that a lot of what makes me successful is that engage,
[7352.60 → 7354.48] that direct engagement with the audience.
[7354.48 → 7355.06] So I,
[7355.32 → 7356.40] I think I'd be kind of,
[7356.46 → 7359.96] I'd be handicapping myself in a way that might make it impossible for me.
[7359.96 → 7362.16] Like I'm not an algorithm guru.
[7362.16 → 7364.56] I'm just really excited about what I'm talking about.
[7364.56 → 7365.74] And that works really well.
[7366.18 → 7368.58] So I think it'd be tough for me.
[7368.66 → 7369.56] I think it'd be really tough.
[7369.78 → 7375.92] I have some good ideas outside of tech that I think I could probably crush it with.
[7376.40 → 7376.80] Um,
[7376.80 → 7384.00] but they are very time-consuming ideas that I wouldn't really be able to pursue as long as I'm running Linus Media Group.
[7384.88 → 7385.20] Yeah.
[7385.28 → 7386.04] YouTube is hard.
[7386.04 → 7387.24] I know,
[7387.32 → 7387.58] uh,
[7387.78 → 7393.52] other creators like Danny Gonzalez has tried to hide his face or mask his voice and go viral on TikTok and everything like that.
[7393.82 → 7394.38] But like you said,
[7394.46 → 7397.36] people just immediately recognize you, and you start bouncing back.
[7397.36 → 7399.66] So good luck to the people who are just starting now.
[7401.46 → 7404.30] Question from a couple of different people,
[7404.44 → 7419.24] Alexander and Erica have here asking about your thoughts on the direction of infotainment systems in cars with the high rectification and leaning away from just pure information and specs about your car to having a lot of information on your screen.
[7420.26 → 7420.62] Honestly,
[7420.72 → 7423.68] I feel you're as qualified to answer this as I am.
[7424.46 → 7425.12] I mean,
[7425.60 → 7426.06] uh,
[7426.06 → 7427.32] as a normal kind of guy,
[7427.36 → 7429.06] I think it's fascinating,
[7429.06 → 7432.16] but as somebody who likes to pay attention to the road,
[7432.80 → 7435.20] there's a lot that's demanding your attention.
[7435.20 → 7435.52] Now,
[7435.56 → 7439.74] my current car has gauges and sync three from Ford is horrendous.
[7439.78 → 7441.20] So I don't want to look at that screen anyway.
[7441.40 → 7443.16] So I have to pay attention to the road,
[7443.16 → 7445.46] but I couldn't imagine if I have a map,
[7445.48 → 7450.22] I have to look over to change my windshield wiper to change the air temperature in a Tesla.
[7450.22 → 7452.34] It has like a map of your car that to drag.
[7452.46 → 7453.40] Like that's too complicated.
[7453.40 → 7457.22] Now I can't imagine that you're really fully,
[7457.22 → 7458.74] focused on your car when all that's going on,
[7458.80 → 7466.80] but hopefully Apple and Google really pushing Android auto and Apple car play to be the full custom car infotainment system.
[7466.92 → 7470.04] It'll help reduce some of that when it's more standard across all vehicles.
[7470.04 → 7471.06] But I mean,
[7471.06 → 7472.84] those are both probably years away.
[7473.16 → 7473.42] Yeah.
[7473.42 → 7473.96] I don't know.
[7474.02 → 7475.04] I get really frustrated.
[7475.20 → 7475.24] Like,
[7475.32 → 7475.44] yeah,
[7475.44 → 7478.10] the only thing I want to engage with in my car is Android auto.
[7478.72 → 7479.66] Other than that,
[7479.76 → 7480.22] I just,
[7480.40 → 7480.66] you know,
[7480.70 → 7481.26] I've driven Volt,
[7481.32 → 7481.44] right?
[7481.50 → 7482.78] So I've just got a dial for,
[7482.86 → 7483.54] you know,
[7483.62 → 7488.56] fan and our button for where the fan comes out and the dial for how hot it is.
[7489.00 → 7491.54] There's a button on my steering wheel for my heated steering wheel,
[7491.64 → 7492.70] button for my heated seat.
[7492.82 → 7495.64] I think those are about the only things I ever actually engaged with.
[7495.64 → 7496.68] For me,
[7496.84 → 7497.98] I would say the
[7497.98 → 7498.68] the
[7498.68 → 7499.08] the
[7499.08 → 7499.34] the
[7499.34 → 7500.22] the padded,
[7500.94 → 7505.26] padded environment sort of approach that's taken to infotainment is very frustrating.
[7505.48 → 7508.58] If there's one thing that I think Tesla understands really well,
[7508.72 → 7509.64] it's that,
[7509.64 → 7510.42] uh,
[7510.42 → 7518.40] you're far better off with the very limited amount of distraction from typing the first three characters of something and clicking what it auto completes.
[7518.40 → 7522.28] compared to fighting with voice input and the way that,
[7522.28 → 7522.88] um,
[7523.16 → 7524.82] Android auto has,
[7524.98 → 7527.62] has more and more forcibly,
[7527.62 → 7529.12] uh,
[7529.38 → 7534.82] pushed voice interaction over the last few years has been extraordinarily frustrating to me.
[7534.96 → 7540.84] Like the distracted that I get from entering a voice input three or four times,
[7540.84 → 7545.18] having it either go to the wrong place or not hear me correctly.
[7545.32 → 7547.50] And then all of a sudden now,
[7547.50 → 7548.20] oh man,
[7548.24 → 7550.50] it's getting real complicated because like Waze,
[7550.60 → 7551.06] for example,
[7551.06 → 7553.16] won't even open on your phone screen.
[7553.42 → 7554.40] If you have,
[7554.50 → 7556.04] and they're owned by Google for those of you who don't know,
[7556.08 → 7557.54] this is definitely a Google problem,
[7557.54 → 7560.12] but it won't even open on your phone.
[7560.12 → 7562.36] If you have it plugged into your car,
[7562.44 → 7568.04] which is really stupid because sometimes I'm in the passenger seat and I just wanted to just
[7568.04 → 7572.58] key something in because it's way better and way faster.
[7572.58 → 7573.58] Um,
[7573.88 → 7574.10] but,
[7574.16 → 7574.76] but I can't at all.
[7574.80 → 7575.76] So I have to unplug it,
[7576.08 → 7576.96] type something in,
[7577.28 → 7578.24] plug it back in,
[7578.50 → 7579.24] open the app.
[7579.30 → 7584.40] It is so many steps, and it is so distracting compared to if I could just beep,
[7584.40 → 7584.54] beep,
[7584.60 → 7584.84] book,
[7585.62 → 7585.88] boom,
[7586.00 → 7589.96] while I'm at a red light or at the end of my driveway or wherever it is that I happen to be,
[7589.96 → 7592.08] that would be way,
[7592.50 → 7593.32] way better.
[7594.02 → 7594.38] Um,
[7595.40 → 7596.14] yeah,
[7596.38 → 7596.98] that's,
[7597.06 → 7597.28] that's,
[7597.36 → 7599.60] I think my biggest frustration.
[7600.50 → 7600.90] Uh,
[7600.98 → 7601.56] tape X says,
[7601.62 → 7603.74] don't pretend you don't use every setting on the variable wiper speed.
[7603.80 → 7603.94] Yeah,
[7604.00 → 7604.18] yeah,
[7604.18 → 7604.56] I do,
[7604.62 → 7605.60] but it's right on the stock.
[7605.64 → 7606.10] So it doesn't,
[7606.20 → 7607.30] I don't even have to look to use it.
[7607.32 → 7607.98] It's just right there.
[7608.44 → 7608.54] Yeah.
[7608.54 → 7609.64] You should have tried the lucid air.
[7609.84 → 7610.58] Like it was,
[7610.70 → 7612.16] the software was honestly horrendous.
[7612.28 → 7613.64] Like the screen,
[7613.66 → 7614.08] uh,
[7614.08 → 7617.04] is supposed to lift so you can put stuff in between it and like the
[7617.04 → 7619.94] the gap in the kind of centre console wouldn't work.
[7620.80 → 7621.60] Backseat stuff.
[7621.72 → 7622.92] Screen wouldn't turn on.
[7623.50 → 7623.82] Uh,
[7623.82 → 7625.10] all the features were like disabled.
[7625.42 → 7625.70] Uh,
[7625.70 → 7626.80] if you haven't watched that short circuit,
[7626.90 → 7627.08] I mean,
[7627.08 → 7628.84] you should subscribe, and you should watch that video.
[7629.28 → 7629.76] Uh,
[7629.82 → 7630.64] but it,
[7630.76 → 7633.98] it shows that software can ruin a very,
[7634.10 → 7634.72] very nice vehicle.
[7636.56 → 7637.00] Uh,
[7637.00 → 7638.36] next question here is from Alejandro.
[7638.72 → 7641.20] Been watching since Anthony broke the iMac.
[7641.20 → 7645.94] Have you considered a video where a real hacker shows how much control and info someone can access,
[7646.30 → 7646.70] smart home,
[7646.82 → 7647.04] computer,
[7647.14 → 7647.42] et cetera,
[7647.42 → 7650.04] maybe sponsored by someone who can prevent such attacks.
[7650.38 → 7651.54] Everyone we've ever,
[7651.54 → 7652.26] uh,
[7652.26 → 7653.46] talked to about,
[7653.46 → 7655.30] you know,
[7656.42 → 7659.46] intentionally hacking or,
[7659.46 → 7660.56] or infecting,
[7660.56 → 7660.90] um,
[7660.90 → 7662.30] anything here,
[7662.56 → 7663.14] um,
[7663.26 → 7663.62] has,
[7663.76 → 7666.36] has never really been willing to do it.
[7666.36 → 7673.52] And I think there's kind of like a code of ethics that they're following that prevents them from doing that.
[7673.56 → 7674.42] And I respect that,
[7674.52 → 7674.82] but yeah,
[7674.82 → 7675.74] I think it could be,
[7675.82 → 7676.68] it could be good content.
[7677.24 → 7677.64] Uh,
[7677.74 → 7678.64] Lee Tween asks,
[7678.68 → 7679.96] any update on the Porsche order?
[7679.96 → 7680.76] Um,
[7681.40 → 7683.66] Yvonne and I are still working that out.
[7684.24 → 7686.18] I was getting one.
[7686.24 → 7686.80] Then I wasn't.
[7686.84 → 7687.28] Then I was,
[7687.36 → 7687.90] then I wasn't.
[7687.94 → 7688.36] Then I wasn't.
[7688.36 → 7688.78] Then I wasn't.
[7688.82 → 7689.20] Then I wasn't.
[7689.28 → 7689.90] Then I wasn't.
[7690.28 → 7690.64] Uh,
[7690.64 → 7692.16] I think right now we're on was,
[7692.58 → 7693.16] um,
[7693.60 → 7695.22] but she's never actually driven it.
[7695.30 → 7697.70] So I think she should try driving it first.
[7697.80 → 7699.00] And if she doesn't like it,
[7699.00 → 7703.36] then I'm just not going to get it because there's no point having a car in the garage that only one of us wants to drive.
[7703.52 → 7703.96] That's stupid.
[7704.22 → 7704.34] Yeah.
[7704.34 → 7705.18] Is she interested in cars?
[7705.26 → 7706.72] Is there an electric vehicle that she's been like,
[7706.72 → 7707.36] I would like that?
[7708.16 → 7708.30] Hmm.
[7708.90 → 7709.92] Not even a little.
[7710.12 → 7711.84] Her favourite car to drive is our minivan.
[7712.08 → 7712.46] She's like,
[7712.50 → 7712.70] yeah,
[7712.88 → 7713.20] you know,
[7713.40 → 7714.06] props to Honda.
[7714.14 → 7715.44] The Odyssey is a great vehicle,
[7715.62 → 7716.06] but like.
[7718.58 → 7718.98] Mm hmm.
[7722.02 → 7722.46] Um,
[7722.86 → 7725.52] next question here.
[7727.24 → 7728.40] With how,
[7728.64 → 7729.44] uh,
[7729.44 → 7731.18] the given state of the internet is.
[7731.30 → 7731.68] Oh boy.
[7731.68 → 7733.30] They say cesspool.
[7734.12 → 7736.68] What do you think a good internet looks like?
[7736.98 → 7737.88] That question's from Robert.
[7738.20 → 7740.68] I don't think there is a good internet.
[7740.84 → 7745.36] I think the internet is a reflection of the people using it and people are complicated.
[7747.54 → 7748.60] Enjoy your sweatpants.
[7754.72 → 7757.48] I guess since these are potential rather than curated ones,
[7757.58 → 7758.42] I might as well-read them.
[7758.60 → 7758.84] Yeah.
[7758.84 → 7759.14] It's like,
[7759.16 → 7759.98] I don't know which ones you,
[7760.04 → 7760.24] uh,
[7760.50 → 7762.48] have or haven't answered over the last few weeks or.
[7762.84 → 7762.92] Yeah.
[7762.96 → 7763.16] No,
[7763.20 → 7764.62] I haven't tried the sleep buds too.
[7764.70 → 7765.52] I probably should.
[7765.52 → 7766.32] Um,
[7766.32 → 7767.22] thanks for the question.
[7767.84 → 7768.24] Uh,
[7768.42 → 7769.54] Pwn intended.
[7770.70 → 7771.06] Uh,
[7771.22 → 7772.02] Jedi S C,
[7773.18 → 7773.52] uh,
[7773.56 → 7777.62] got the same Epsom theatre projector that I have and have been running into an issue.
[7777.84 → 7779.50] When the input switches HDR modes,
[7779.54 → 7781.14] it goes blank for 15 or so seconds.
[7781.14 → 7783.36] This can be annoying as the Xbox menu is an HDR.
[7783.46 → 7784.10] Have you run into this?
[7784.22 → 7784.46] Yes.
[7784.54 → 7785.08] It's a thing.
[7785.08 → 7787.98] I have no idea if they have any plans to fix it,
[7787.98 → 7788.88] but yes,
[7789.00 → 7789.82] it's annoying.
[7790.00 → 7793.12] It doesn't bother me much because I don't really game on in that room yet.
[7793.84 → 7794.06] Uh,
[7794.06 → 7794.42] but yeah,
[7794.60 → 7794.98] you're right.
[7795.36 → 7795.82] It's annoying.
[7796.34 → 7796.88] A hundred percent.
[7797.48 → 7798.06] Marcus M.
[7798.48 → 7801.10] Other than having great service when customs fail,
[7801.18 → 7804.94] what are you doing or want to do to improve the LTT store experience for European customers?
[7805.18 → 7805.86] In the long-term,
[7805.94 → 7806.90] we want to DC there,
[7807.06 → 7808.04] a distribution centre.
[7808.04 → 7809.08] Uh,
[7809.24 → 7811.86] there is no timeline for that.
[7811.94 → 7812.38] I'm sorry.
[7812.48 → 7814.46] It's really complicated.
[7814.60 → 7816.44] People keep saying it can't be that complicated.
[7816.60 → 7816.70] No,
[7816.74 → 7817.42] it really,
[7817.66 → 7818.30] really can.
[7819.00 → 7825.46] Like having a physical presence in a different country is really complicated from a logistical
[7825.46 → 7826.06] standpoint,
[7826.32 → 7827.70] from a cost standpoint,
[7827.70 → 7829.08] and from a
[7829.08 → 7829.64] uh,
[7829.64 → 7832.06] taxation and compliance standpoint.
[7832.06 → 7832.60] There is,
[7832.86 → 7837.98] there are so many more I's we need to dot and T's we need to cross and lawyers we need
[7837.98 → 7840.38] to pay in order to make sure that we're doing things properly.
[7840.92 → 7842.52] And people will point at,
[7842.74 → 7842.90] you know,
[7842.94 → 7844.98] others who are able to do it just fine.
[7845.02 → 7845.82] And it's clearly easy.
[7846.10 → 7846.36] Uh,
[7846.36 → 7847.32] but it is not,
[7847.66 → 7848.90] it is actually not easy.
[7849.00 → 7851.50] One of the things that as far as we can tell,
[7851.58 → 7853.58] we're the only ones doing properly,
[7853.72 → 7854.26] for example,
[7854.26 → 7855.40] is tax remittance,
[7855.54 → 7856.30] um,
[7857.22 → 7859.64] for orders from LTT store.
[7859.90 → 7861.26] So even the
[7861.26 → 7864.00] even the tax software that we use,
[7864.12 → 7867.16] we are frequently reporting bugs and problems.
[7867.16 → 7868.14] Um,
[7868.18 → 7869.78] we've had issues with,
[7869.78 → 7870.44] um,
[7870.88 → 7875.34] Google's Google having features that aren't supported properly by our tax platform.
[7875.34 → 7875.72] And,
[7876.24 → 7876.60] uh,
[7876.64 → 7877.62] we're kind of sitting here going,
[7877.76 → 7877.88] well,
[7877.92 → 7879.44] other people should have run into this.
[7879.52 → 7883.68] There's other people clearly using these features in the same country as us selling to
[7883.68 → 7885.14] the same countries that we are.
[7885.20 → 7886.14] So they must just,
[7886.24 → 7889.04] the only answer is they must just not be remitting taxes properly,
[7889.04 → 7892.10] but we do not want to get audited five years,
[7892.10 → 7896.66] 10 years from now and find out that we owe $10 million in sales taxes,
[7896.66 → 7900.40] because what happens is if we don't bill you guys for it,
[7900.48 → 7902.54] but a government comes knocking on our door saying,
[7902.66 → 7902.74] Hey,
[7902.80 → 7904.20] you owe us taxes for this.
[7904.84 → 7905.02] Well,
[7905.02 → 7906.30] we can't go back to you for it.
[7906.56 → 7908.06] We have to then pay it.
[7908.24 → 7909.38] That could break us.
[7909.38 → 7909.62] Right?
[7909.62 → 7913.06] So we try to do things properly and yeah,
[7913.10 → 7914.08] if we didn't do things properly,
[7914.20 → 7914.56] for sure,
[7915.04 → 7917.54] nothing would prevent us from just like renting a warehouse,
[7917.76 → 7919.24] like shipping stuff,
[7919.48 → 7921.84] but that's not how we do things.
[7922.12 → 7924.04] And so we're just not set up for it.
[7924.74 → 7925.18] Yeah.
[7925.20 → 7927.08] A lot of people asking about a third party,
[7927.26 → 7927.84] a middleman,
[7927.94 → 7928.52] a reseller.
[7928.70 → 7928.92] No,
[7929.02 → 7929.66] as soon as,
[7929.78 → 7931.94] as soon as our inventory is there,
[7932.00 → 7932.96] we have a presence.
[7932.96 → 7936.48] Even selling on Amazon can be very complicated if you want to do it properly.
[7939.44 → 7946.56] And we're not some like random fly by night from wherever a stand that will just be like,
[7946.64 → 7946.86] okay,
[7946.94 → 7947.08] well,
[7947.12 → 7947.40] forget it.
[7947.42 → 7949.04] We'll just fold up, and we'll start up a new one.
[7949.24 → 7951.50] And what are they going to do about it?
[7951.64 → 7954.94] Like we're in a place where I can be litigated.
[7955.54 → 7955.94] Right?
[7956.66 → 7957.02] No.
[7957.02 → 7957.34] Uh,
[7961.46 → 7961.70] right.
[7961.92 → 7962.24] So,
[7962.30 → 7962.46] uh,
[7962.46 → 7965.06] when is the Luke plushier or shirt quotes coming?
[7966.34 → 7968.92] Favourite quote so far from Luke is that's not interesting.
[7969.08 → 7969.80] Let's move on.
[7969.90 → 7970.34] What's yours?
[7970.42 → 7970.52] Oh,
[7970.56 → 7971.74] gotta be combed it with a brick.
[7971.84 → 7973.00] I forget why he said that.
[7973.16 → 7976.42] It was the most nonsensical thing I've ever heard anyone say ever.
[7976.50 → 7977.78] What does comb it with a brick mean?
[7977.82 → 7978.32] I don't know.
[7978.74 → 7979.02] Uh,
[7979.22 → 7979.54] but I,
[7979.60 → 7980.22] but I loved it.
[7980.24 → 7980.76] I loved it.
[7981.46 → 7981.86] Um,
[7982.36 → 7986.12] any thoughts on cases that LTT could design for full,
[7986.12 → 7987.26] that could be built DIY.
[7988.48 → 7988.88] Um,
[7989.40 → 7992.00] I just don't feel like we have anything to contribute to the
[7992.00 → 7993.46] the case market right now.
[7993.90 → 7996.36] So we don't really have much interest in pursuing that.
[7998.40 → 7998.80] Uh,
[7998.86 → 7999.48] John asks,
[7999.66 → 7999.96] Linus,
[7999.98 → 8002.66] are you ever going to do GPU streaming to Steam Deck video?
[8002.80 → 8003.06] No,
[8003.14 → 8006.26] I don't think that merits being the focus of a full video.
[8007.06 → 8009.80] It's pretty good from my experience with it,
[8009.92 → 8011.00] but I don't really,
[8011.12 → 8011.24] yeah,
[8011.24 → 8012.84] I don't really have much else to say about that.
[8013.50 → 8013.92] Uh,
[8013.96 → 8014.64] anonymous asks,
[8014.64 → 8016.10] are you going to talk about the new AMD Epic?
[8016.12 → 8018.94] Line of Processor and the videos that you did with Supermicro?
[8018.98 → 8019.10] Oh,
[8019.18 → 8019.36] okay.
[8019.42 → 8020.70] I ended up talking about it in the
[8020.76 → 8021.26] in the meantime.
[8021.40 → 8021.52] Yeah,
[8021.58 → 8022.42] it was a fun shoot.
[8022.70 → 8023.04] Uh,
[8023.04 → 8023.74] it was perfect.
[8024.56 → 8024.74] Uh,
[8024.74 → 8030.14] they showed off the entire new lineup of their H13 servers that are going to be for Epic Genoa,
[8030.34 → 8032.26] up to 96 cores of sockets.
[8032.42 → 8033.38] Freaking wild.
[8033.94 → 8035.12] PCIe Gen 5,
[8035.56 → 8035.82] uh,
[8035.84 → 8040.74] 168 lanes in the single server version and 160 lanes in the DPs.
[8040.74 → 8041.86] Like that is,
[8042.06 → 8042.80] that is,
[8042.88 → 8045.36] that is freaking wild,
[8045.54 → 8045.76] man.
[8045.92 → 8047.20] Like you could have,
[8047.96 → 8049.54] what does that even work out to?
[8049.62 → 8050.08] Like what's a
[8050.12 → 8052.28] what's 160 divided by four?
[8054.50 → 8055.42] Over four.
[8055.62 → 8062.68] You could have 40 fricking Gen 5 drives running at full tilt in one dual processor server.
[8062.68 → 8065.50] It's a man.
[8065.98 → 8066.22] Yeah.
[8066.38 → 8066.80] Love it.
[8067.48 → 8067.88] Love it.
[8068.80 → 8069.34] All right.
[8070.02 → 8070.58] Is that it?
[8070.78 → 8071.24] That's it.
[8072.36 → 8073.42] This is interesting.
[8073.58 → 8074.34] Bring says,
[8074.54 → 8082.42] I was recently at a chemical society meeting where the topic of discussion was nearly fire and explosion proof lithium-ion batteries.
[8082.78 → 8092.50] The company that was presenting the information supplies a phone company in Europe that builds hyper safe cell phones for dangerous workplaces like mines and industrial places.
[8092.68 → 8095.76] Would this be something LTT would be interested in covering in a video?
[8095.86 → 8095.98] Yeah,
[8096.04 → 8097.18] I think I'd be interested in that.
[8097.74 → 8099.12] I'm pretty easy to get in touch with.
[8099.22 → 8100.80] There's a publicly listed email,
[8101.22 → 8101.72] um,
[8101.74 → 8102.34] on the channel.
[8102.34 → 8104.00] So that's a good place to kind of,
[8104.00 → 8104.72] uh,
[8104.72 → 8105.86] send something like that.
[8105.90 → 8106.10] If the
[8106.18 → 8108.50] if you actually work for that company, and you want to,
[8108.60 → 8108.86] you know,
[8108.86 → 8109.94] work with us or whatever else,
[8109.94 → 8110.90] that seems pretty cool.
[8111.46 → 8114.58] And I think that's pretty much it for the show today.
[8114.74 → 8114.90] Oh,
[8115.08 → 8117.30] I promised I'd give you guys an update on,
[8117.40 → 8118.28] uh,
[8118.28 → 8121.12] whether you guys like hard mode or easy mode puzzles.
[8121.12 → 8123.74] So let me just get that for you.
[8124.12 → 8125.10] I'm going to refresh this.
[8127.44 → 8128.46] All right.
[8130.00 → 8130.64] Um,
[8130.88 → 8139.36] about 85% of you like hard mode and about a little over 5% of you,
[8139.36 → 8140.22] uh,
[8140.30 → 8147.18] like each medium mode and very easy mode with the least popular being the 100 piece version.
[8147.18 → 8156.36] So there are more fakers and frauds than there are people who will admit that they don't really like a challenge that much.
[8157.64 → 8158.16] Oh,
[8158.22 → 8159.66] which is pretty hilarious.
[8159.66 → 8162.56] Oh man,
[8162.60 → 8163.62] this is super annoying.
[8164.10 → 8167.34] The Shopify dashboard hasn't been loading properly for me.
[8167.36 → 8168.68] If anyone from Shopify is watching,
[8168.82 → 8170.66] I do not wish to have this sidebar.
[8170.88 → 8177.38] I need the sidebar to go away so I can actually interact with the hamburger menu that is loaded behind it here.
[8177.38 → 8179.30] I need that in order to go back,
[8179.30 → 8179.98] but I can't.
[8180.36 → 8181.42] So that's really,
[8181.78 → 8182.00] really,
[8182.00 → 8182.52] really,
[8182.52 → 8183.30] really annoying.
[8183.44 → 8185.68] I basically can't use my dashboard on mobile anymore.
[8185.76 → 8187.30] It started happening in like the last week.
[8187.90 → 8188.28] All right.
[8188.32 → 8188.82] That's it.
[8189.38 → 8190.10] Thanks for watching.
[8190.26 → 8191.08] We'll see you again next week.
[8191.16 → 8191.90] Same bad time.
[8192.04 → 8192.60] Same bad channel.
[8193.32 → 8193.98] Don't push that button.
[8194.10 → 8194.32] Remember?
[8194.52 → 8194.64] Well,
[8194.72 → 8196.42] you're going to have to say goodbye for Luke though.
[8196.74 → 8196.94] Bye.
[8197.44 → 8197.72] All right.
[8197.76 → 8198.08] Good job.
[8198.08 → 8198.10] Good job.
[8198.10 → 8198.22] Good job.
[8198.22 → 8200.16] Good job.
[8200.16 → 8202.16] Good job.
[8202.16 → 8204.16] Good job.
[8204.16 → 8205.10] Good job.
[8205.10 → 8206.10] Good job.
