[0.00 → 9.18] what is up everyone happy Friday and welcome to the wan show we've got a great show lined up for
[9.18 → 12.74] you this week actually that's a lie we've got nothing this week, but we're going to make the most
[12.74 → 18.78] of it because we do have a few things to talk about starting of course with subscriptions
[18.78 → 25.34] why is everything in life a subscription everything mercedes is going to be
[25.34 → 33.96] locking better acceleration performance behind a subscription never mind a paywall it's a
[33.96 → 40.94] subscription also this week in Elon twitter we've got an update on all of that we're gonna uh you
[40.94 → 46.24] know what let's not even make that a main topic no forget it let's talk about UFC's up you see
[46.24 → 52.28] uh that's right a sub brand of charger slash battery giant anchor has been spotted sending
[52.28 → 56.92] pictures and video to their cloud servers without user consent we'll be discussing that what else
[56.92 → 61.72] we got this week I'm gonna call out two just randomly bolded lines of text because those are
[61.72 → 67.96] often the most fun topics that we have one of them says marvel used to be good okay and I'm interested
[67.96 → 72.80] these were desperation topics they sure were another one says I got a car what's up with that
[72.80 → 80.96] did you buy a new car oh I tried to roll the intro, and it broke um uh uh
[80.96 → 91.20] uh dan Dany Dann what's happening way to go Dan what is happening we could act it out
[91.20 → 98.00] this is this has never happened before oh well we've got spot on brought to you by Mel science
[98.00 → 104.34] new egg and Messi footwear thanks cool well that was fun uh why don't we jump right into our first
[104.34 → 114.82] topic of the day subscriptions come on not accelerate oh man okay I want to jump in real
[114.82 → 122.16] quick here and say that the editorializing in our notes is unacceptable and the writer who worked on
[122.16 → 130.14] this topic you know who you are Alex Clark oh wow yeah hold not okay I'm this are these are not my
[130.14 → 137.26] words not satisfied with just making the worst electric cars around Mercedes will now be locking
[137.26 → 144.94] increased acceleration under a 1200 yearly subscription oh all right this is me now this is me so much
[144.94 → 153.64] can I just say that even though Alex is so angry about this he's you can almost tell that subliminally
[153.64 → 160.68] he has kind of accepted the premise of a subscription and here I will explain what I mean by that he
[160.68 → 170.82] describes it as them locking increased acceleration behind a 1200 yearly subscription I think that if we
[170.82 → 181.34] described this situation 10 years ago we would have said holding or or or holding acceleration
[181.34 → 191.18] hostage unless you pay 1200 of ransom yeah right because the acceleration is there yeah you were
[191.18 → 197.66] supposed to be more mad yeah yeah you weren't mad enough yeah come on so I do not editorialize I do not
[197.66 → 206.14] agree with Alex's approach to this topic for real though we've kind of accepted it we say you pay this
[206.14 → 212.52] much to get more we don't think of it as what I haven't paid enough, and you're taking it away but
[212.52 → 219.14] that's what it is the battery performance is clearly in the vehicle the motor performance is clearly in the
[219.14 → 225.28] vehicle and unlike some situations where, and we'll talk about one in a moment where I've even defended
[225.28 → 234.52] subscriptions to unlock functionality there is no additional R&D in this product that was going to be
[234.52 → 241.78] no benefit to the average user of it but that they had to do for a small subset of users who well than
[241.78 → 248.82] have to pay for that cost you're buying a Mercedes you probably want this exactly yeah exactly and
[248.82 → 256.18] and unlike some situations where maybe the cost of the product is extremely low like say for example
[256.18 → 261.72] in many cases the heart okay sure even something like a cell phone a lot of the time you get the
[261.72 → 266.96] hardware subsidized by the monthly subscription, and ultimately you are paying for it, you're paying
[266.96 → 272.94] for it and then some yeah, but you're getting it on a payment plan no this is a car you already
[272.94 → 283.62] bought yeah it's literally just a microtransaction of 1200 for a car 1200 that's a lot a hundred dollars a
[283.62 → 289.34] month yeah think about the things in your life that cost a hundred dollars a month the internet
[289.34 → 296.80] connection to my house that gets extensive extensive use oh yeah and is like that's the
[296.80 → 303.72] only thing it does of course it's a subscription it has to be used monthly yeah I don't own the lines i
[303.72 → 310.50] don't own the distribution all that type of stuff so super frustrating I am yeah really hopeful that
[310.50 → 317.72] automotive hackers just wreak havoc on all of this stuff I don't know if that's like super hold on
[317.72 → 326.10] friendly we would hate for that to happen yeah definitely don't want that super upsetting I think
[326.10 → 331.02] people went in there and unlocked this uh and also the heated seats and also everything else that's
[331.02 → 335.92] going on the poor automakers wouldn't that be horrible wouldn't that be a shame for them well you
[335.92 → 341.84] know why this is happening Luke I don't even necessarily think that this is down to a consumer
[341.84 → 348.26] acceptance of this practice this is down to a shareholder expectation that when something is
[348.26 → 355.30] sold it generates ongoing revenue yeah like I was talking to uh I was talking to someone I don't want
[355.30 → 361.30] to identify this person so it was someone either on the doing of or receiving end of some kind of VC
[361.30 → 367.58] something okay so venture capital and what they basically said was that no VC wants to even start a
[367.58 → 373.34] conversation with you unless there's a recurring revenue model, and you can see this reflected in
[373.34 → 378.78] the stocks of mature companies totally that are kind of sitting here going, and you could describe
[378.78 → 384.68] the automotive industry as fairly mature tesla came in they disrupted because they had a value add they
[384.68 → 390.10] had a promise of something different autonomous driving for example was going to be a source of
[390.10 → 395.76] ongoing revenue for them, it was going to change them from just a car company to a data company to a
[395.76 → 401.86] software company right and especially at that time software company valuations were nothing like
[401.86 → 407.32] hardware company valuations right and nothing like they are now so this is a way for a mature company
[407.32 → 414.30] like a Mercedes to say hey we're building hardware as a service right we've got recurring revenue
[414.30 → 420.18] we're going to put out you know however many hundreds of thousands of these cars this year, and they are going
[420.18 → 424.92] to be the gift that keeps on giving for a decade two decades to come
[424.92 → 433.78] well it sucks um it sucks because cars cost enough already Mercedes to me this feels like a big part of
[433.78 → 438.20] the reason why so many people have been against right to repair for a long time because right to repair
[438.20 → 444.96] I think would shelter a lot of activities that would get people to a point where they could bypass this type
[444.96 → 449.56] of stuff because hardware interventions oh when you said people being against right to repair I thought
[449.56 → 453.94] you meant consumers and I was like no I think consumers who against right to repair are simply
[453.94 → 460.10] brainwashed yeah I actually do think it's its that straightforward or the reason for brainwashing
[460.10 → 465.02] or whatever else however you want to flag it so the advocates against right to repair I think a lot
[465.02 → 471.34] of it has been because of this type of stuff because it's if people have full control over the things
[471.34 → 477.18] that they own which is how that should work it's easier for them to bypass these types of things
[477.18 → 486.84] um to enable this by default um by bypassing it physically or doing whatever else um yeah i uh
[486.84 → 493.58] yeah this sucks I wouldn't buy a Mercedes I wasn't going to anyway to be clear well but now i definitely
[493.58 → 499.50] want Alan on float plane says you just described my favourite topic Linus the financialization of the
[499.50 → 505.24] economy it all traces back to Reagan era policy changes and deregulation one of the most mind
[505.24 → 510.74] boggling things and if you feel like this is a political conversation you're wrong it's not political
[510.74 → 517.24] it's just math is not political it's just numbers okay one of the most mind-blowing things to me
[517.24 → 525.56] is the acceptance among certain groups of the idea of trickle-down economics yeah it is so I had this
[525.56 → 530.58] conversation with my dad a little while ago because he listens to a lot of podcasts and
[530.58 → 538.86] gets a lot of ideas that i just i simply i I can't, I can't follow him there um, but this was one
[538.86 → 546.32] thing in particular that I went look pops we got to talk about this because you are literally a math
[546.32 → 553.32] teacher if you cannot follow me with the math on this and come to the conclusion that no in fact this
[553.32 → 559.06] is not a good concept and not something that could ever make any sense or ever work i I don't know if
[559.06 → 564.42] we're living in the same reality anymore yeah yeah the argument okay the argument for trickle-down
[564.42 → 573.82] economics right is that if you tax the businesses less they will have more money left over to shower
[573.82 → 582.14] upon their employees right that's the idea it will put more money into the economy where it will
[582.14 → 591.18] circulate which is a good thing that's the idea let me explain why it doesn't work okay I am a
[591.18 → 594.66] business owner and this was the only way I was able to get through to him, I was able to get through to
[594.66 → 600.54] him I am a business owner that's rare so let's give me let's give me a couple hypotheticals here let's say
[600.54 → 610.62] that I had a tax rate of about 50 okay um just to use nice easy numbers so let's say my business does
[610.62 → 621.66] uh a million dollars of profit okay on that profit you only pay taxes on profit okay you don't pay taxes
[621.66 → 629.02] on gross revenues you pay taxes after all of your expenses and deductions you pay it on your profit
[629.02 → 639.54] so if I have a high tax rate I just paid half a million dollars in taxes right which sucks nobody wants to pay
[639.54 → 645.78] half a million dollars in taxes, and so I can see where on the surface you might reach this conclusion
[645.78 → 651.46] that okay well we should probably tax you less so that you hire more people here's the mind-blowing
[651.46 → 662.42] bit if I hired more people say half a million dollars worth of people the taxes that I would pay on the
[662.42 → 668.34] five hundred thousand dollars that I was left with for profit are actually only two hundred fifty thousand dollars
[669.38 → 675.62] now you might say yeah but Linus 500 grand left over is a lot better than 250 grand left over
[676.18 → 683.78] it is but this is one of the biggest lies of trickle-down economics that it incentivizes by lowering taxes
[683.78 → 690.42] you incentivize investments into businesses so that they'll grow let's think what would be most efficient if I had a high tax rate
[690.42 → 700.18] spending half of my money paying taxes or hiring people growing the size of my business reinvesting in it
[701.14 → 709.86] and ultimately making money like that by doing something productive by creating jobs and growing
[709.86 → 715.22] the size of my business and value of the company now let's do it the other way let's say the tax rate is
[715.22 → 722.50] only 10 so now I have that million dollars and I'm thinking oh I paid a hundred thousand dollars in
[722.50 → 726.50] taxes I got 900 grand well that seems pretty good I think I'll keep it
[728.98 → 735.46] it's so it's not like you have to do like a deep psychological analysis of oh yeah of human behaviour
[735.46 → 740.02] I mean with basic observation you can see it across the board that's pretty obvious so now if I were to
[740.02 → 743.78] spend you know half a million dollars hiring more people um
[747.38 → 752.90] why you have 400 yeah i i i i i i I well I just won't do that I'll just take more
[753.94 → 760.26] and that's what has created this climate where people are incentivized to simply hoard wealth like
[760.26 → 768.34] dragons because that 900 grand is very effectively deployed either in the markets or in uh you know
[768.34 → 774.02] resources uh speculative investments whatever the case may be whereas if you tell me well hey if you
[774.02 → 781.14] don't use it on your operating company I'm going to take it away well I'm highly incentivized to invest
[781.14 → 787.94] it into my operating company yeah that's how this works that's that's that's that's how the growth that
[787.94 → 795.86] took place leading up to the 80s happened I have no idea how receptive people are to this topic or
[795.86 → 801.46] whatever else, but it's something that's really important to me and really frustrating to me um
[804.02 → 810.66] especially as a business owner who like literally runs into literally that problem well yeah yeah as
[810.66 → 815.06] a business owner who doesn't have to who doesn't have to put myself in a hypothetical situation to
[815.06 → 821.62] understand how I could be incentivized one way or the other no successful business owner likes wasting
[821.62 → 827.86] money and pretty much every successful business owner sees paying taxes as pretty much a spectacular
[827.86 → 835.62] waste of money it has no benefit to me yeah at a certain point from your level of perception you're
[835.62 → 840.42] deleting it I don't think anybody likes paying taxes obviously I'm pretty grateful that there's
[840.42 → 845.46] somewhere to yeah there's somewhere to take my kids to get an education road to get there's a
[845.46 → 852.34] road to drive on yeah right but from like a bank account stand yeah I don't think it's an I don't
[852.34 → 860.58] think it's a wild um belief or a wild perception to say that once taxes leave my wallet they're just
[861.54 → 869.14] they're gone yeah you know yeah so i um to bring us back to the Mercedes conversation yeah yeah
[869.94 → 872.90] just there's a really, really good comment in flow plane chat so I wanted to bring it out
[872.90 → 877.78] whiskey nerd 88 said the state of New Jersey banned subscription models like this for cars
[877.78 → 884.18] I am proud of my state for this amazing absolutely fantastic way to go New Jersey
[884.74 → 891.30] yeah can we just find more politicians like the ones who got that going yeah and only elect people
[891.30 → 896.58] like that that'd be great that would be perfect I have no idea who did that but good job New Jersey
[896.58 → 901.14] because that's absolutely fantastic yeah shout out super, super cool shout out
[901.14 → 907.22] so but yeah no i I don't even know how we got onto that topic yeah sorry I don't know but
[907.22 → 910.74] I think that was a good rundown because i I feel pretty strongly about all that as well
[911.30 → 915.94] uh there was another topic that was in the chat that I had really wanted to talk about but I didn't
[915.94 → 921.30] copy and paste it into my little notepad so I guess i uh I guess I missed out on it someone said doesn't
[921.30 → 925.54] New Jersey stop you from pumping your own gas though we didn't say they're perfect we're just proud of
[925.54 → 932.82] them for this one thing okay I don't know that much about New Jersey um just you know what no
[932.82 → 937.38] subscriptions for cars is great good job and everyone can have a win sometimes yeah just because
[937.38 → 942.58] they're not perfect all the time doesn't mean that we shouldn't say great job when they do something
[942.58 → 946.98] right absolutely I think the world needs a little bit more of that yeah you know what I don't agree
[946.98 → 953.30] with you about everything, but you nailed that one good job you know like yeah we just we need more of
[953.30 → 960.74] that man yeah um yeah a lot of discussion about taxes in the float plane chat yeah paying taxes is
[960.74 → 966.26] good when it's spent properly says owner guy watching it get pissed away on you know six thousand
[966.26 → 971.86] dollar a night hotel rooms makes me want to abolish tax yeah 100 taxes is great taxes is really
[971.86 → 979.94] frustrating taxes is infuriating it happens a lot we were talking recently whoa I don't know if I want
[979.94 → 986.74] to go down that road you know what I'm talking about no the six billion dollars a year thing or
[986.74 → 995.06] whatever uh I don't know I think we can talk about it without um I do not wish to wade into this debate
[995.06 → 1000.26] because it's an extremely complex topic and if anyone claims to have a simple solution they're either a
[1000.26 → 1005.94] simpleton or a liar uh we have a homelessness crisis in Vancouver that I think is fairly
[1005.94 → 1014.18] well publicized throughout the world and uh there's a lot of debate on you know yeah there's
[1014.18 → 1021.46] there's a lot of debate on every side of this issue of this very complex multifaceted issue about what the
[1021.46 → 1028.34] the best way to tackle it is whether it's safe injection sites or whether it's a harder stance against the
[1028.34 → 1036.50] availability of substances that lead people to this uh this homelessness and uh opioid abuse uh crisis
[1036.50 → 1044.74] that we hear that we're facing in our city um and one of the things that regardless of what the correct
[1044.74 → 1055.14] solution is that came to light recently here in Vancouver is that the cost of the ongoing upkeep and care
[1055.14 → 1064.90] is so high like so astronomically high that it sort of defies any kind of reason it feels unimaginable
[1064.90 → 1073.62] that they couldn't have done something more with five billion a year in funding yeah like i whatever
[1073.62 → 1078.82] it is I'm not saying that I have the answer no and I'm not saying that I have the answer either it's an
[1078.82 → 1085.78] extraordinary complicated issue absolutely but to see that many people still struggling in that way
[1085.78 → 1092.66] suffering absolutely knowing that five billion dollars is being spent to theoretically ease that
[1092.66 → 1099.78] suffering and seeing it still going on is like what I don't know i I don't think it's the thing that you
[1099.78 → 1107.30] can completely solve at any point in time but the level of it in Vancouver is brutal so yeah it's not even
[1107.30 → 1112.26] where we are like we're not even that close to Vancouver but you don't want something in your
[1112.26 → 1118.10] backyard to be nobody wants their neighbour to suffer yeah and if they do, they suck yeah if you
[1118.10 → 1124.58] want your neighbour to suffer you suck it's that simple right yeah anyway off that sad topic uh prime
[1124.58 → 1132.66] gaming's gaming's biggie 229 so that's a twitch username if I've ever seen one devil's advocate this
[1132.66 → 1137.54] extra charge on the Mercedes covers the extra usage of equipment due to that acceleration
[1138.34 → 1144.98] in parentheses warranty costs so you can sell the same car but Joe who doesn't care for the g-force
[1144.98 → 1153.30] doesn't pay doesn't get zero to sec 60 in however many you know single handfuls of seconds but jimmy uh
[1153.30 → 1159.30] does care and it may, might cost more in warranty returns so he covers the cost using this charge
[1159.30 → 1164.90] it's not a bad devil's advocate argument but I would make the argument that if that little bit
[1164.90 → 1169.06] of extra acceleration is going to make the car blow up then you probably shouldn't have it available at
[1169.06 → 1175.22] all yeah sounds good that's my that's my response to that so if it's validated for it then you should
[1175.22 → 1183.46] unlock it and honestly speaking car warranties suck anyway they are not very generous and to
[1183.46 → 1189.70] be clear i it's not like I'm not painfully aware of the warranty debacle that we went through recently
[1189.70 → 1194.90] but it's not the same thing car warranties are laid out in very black and white terms and it's very
[1194.90 → 1200.82] clear from my interactions with every dealer and every car manufacturer that I've ever encountered
[1200.82 → 1205.54] that they will do absolutely everything they can to avoid taking care of you it's the very opposite of
[1205.54 → 1210.10] trust me bro which we go out of our way to make sure that even if something's not covered by our
[1210.10 → 1214.18] warranty we take care of the customer it's a completely different philosophical approach to
[1214.18 → 1222.42] warranty coverage and so from my point of view um I just don't have any sympathy for car manufacturers
[1222.42 → 1229.06] and their feeble warranty coverage um at all yeah yeah screw them
[1232.10 → 1237.14] all right should we talk about the other stuff in here because it's not just Mercedes we talked
[1237.14 → 1241.78] recently about uh Alex had one more thing to talk about there and I think it's probably fair to
[1241.78 → 1246.58] point out yeah the acceleration increase is going to boost horsepower and torque of the various trims
[1246.58 → 1254.90] by 20 to 24 so it's not insubstantial um improving zero to 60 times by almost a second which is a lot
[1254.90 → 1259.14] and Alex said and he I think he's right here I'm actually not super against users paying once
[1259.14 → 1262.42] for an update like this um especially you know in
[1265.70 → 1270.10] it doesn't it is it could be less oh man maybe this is just some accepting again it could be less
[1270.10 → 1274.50] toxic I mean what I'd like to see is if they do the R&D and figure out that it's like better
[1274.50 → 1278.66] then they should just keep selling more cars and roll it out to everybody provide extra value for
[1278.66 → 1284.50] under promise overdeliver right but he's right it is could be a lot less bad like if they put in
[1284.50 → 1290.34] the R&D to increase the acceleration which is not insubstantial you have to go and take these cars
[1290.34 → 1294.98] that you like already worked on already finished delivered and go do a bunch more extensive
[1294.98 → 1299.46] testing on them and go oh wow we can actually squeeze a little bit more out of this than yeah by all
[1299.46 → 1307.86] means offer that as an OTA update to an old model but to have to be planning on it the 2024 be planning on
[1308.90 → 1313.06] and offering it as a subscription when you're clearly doing not as a one-time either yeah it's kind of
[1313.06 → 1317.94] like day zero DLC you know you remember how frustrated people used to get I just installed
[1317.94 → 1326.26] the LCS on the disc you already made it I just paid full price for this game and it's not like
[1326.26 → 1332.50] they're giving you a discount on the car no okay so that's it that's it for the Mercedes but there's
[1332.50 → 1338.50] even more bad subscription news let's go I don't know if it had this name the last time we talked about
[1338.50 → 1343.86] it but we have sort of talked about it, I think it didn't yet uh yeah so intel now has officially
[1343.86 → 1351.14] revealed their intel on demand branding which will allow owners of fourth gen Leon scalable
[1351.14 → 1359.54] I like that uh this fourth gen scalable sapphire rapids processors to either pay a one-time fee
[1359.54 → 1368.42] not as bad or a recurring subscription horrible uh to unlock this includes software guard extensions
[1368.42 → 1373.86] dynamic load balancer intel data streaming accelerator intel in-memory analytics accelerator
[1373.86 → 1380.90] intel in-memory analytics accelerator again uh or intel quick assist technology
[1382.34 → 1386.58] that's quite a few things um and some things that are actually pretty legit the
[1386.58 → 1393.54] it having an option for a one-time in my opinion does make it better that helps a lot that helps a
[1393.54 → 1399.22] ton the fact that Mercedes doesn't have an option for a one-time purchase does make it significantly
[1399.22 → 1404.82] worse now do I think intel is going to make these processors cheaper to make it so that the full fat
[1404.82 → 1411.86] price would be all the one-time purchases plus the purchase of the processor no and that's where a
[1411.86 → 1419.06] little bit of the problem comes in um and yeah we'll also have to see what the one-time cost versus
[1419.06 → 1424.74] the subscription cost is um it doesn't say how much the one-time fee is do you get a discount if you buy
[1424.74 → 1436.50] all of them at once I don't know lots of unknowns but yeah extremely frustrating um I don't mind subscriptions as
[1436.50 → 1443.86] much when they are commercial products it offends me and I'm coming at this from my person from my
[1443.86 → 1450.50] dual perspectives one as a consumer and two as a business owner because the reality of it is that
[1450.50 → 1457.06] anything that you are buying as a business should be used to theoretically generate revenue yeah and
[1457.94 → 1462.82] well then it just becomes it's its an entirely different calculus right because if it's a hundred
[1462.82 → 1469.38] dollars a month but I can make a thousand dollars a month then it's a lot easier to justify whereas
[1469.38 → 1479.30] I think that pat going past business past prosumer all the way to consumer grade devices you have it's
[1479.30 → 1483.78] a it's its less of a calculation of how much money can I make with this in fact it almost never is how
[1483.78 → 1487.86] much money can I make with this, and it's more about how does this improve my quality of life
[1487.86 → 1494.98] and that answer has to be it improves my quality of life a lot it shouldn't be how much would not
[1494.98 → 1500.98] paying this yeah diminish your quality of life because that's when it becomes not a subscription
[1500.98 → 1507.86] to a service that's when it becomes a ransom for some kind of quality of life improvement that is
[1507.86 → 1513.22] being held hostage from you, and it's its it's very it's very frustrating there's another dystopian
[1513.22 → 1521.06] product paywall that in this situation maybe kind of how does this make sense um it's the
[1521.06 → 1528.34] slim ai1 airbag vest so it's an it's a motorcycle vest um I believe there's actually some
[1530.42 → 1535.22] there's uh some features of it that are like connected if I recall correctly there's one of
[1535.22 → 1539.70] these airbag vest style products that definitely did work like that I don't know if it's this one
[1539.70 → 1547.70] um so it won't work unless you pay to activate its sensor platform it's 400 for permanent activation
[1547.70 → 1552.26] okay thank you for having that I have that a hundred and dollar 120 for a one-year subscription
[1552.26 → 1558.58] or 60 for six months it's actually cheaper on Black Friday apparently um the positive argument in this
[1558.58 → 1562.98] case is that many people ride motorbikes seasonally, so this allows them to pause their subscription when
[1562.98 → 1568.82] they don't ride so you buy a six-month package which is not discounted on the one-year version however
[1568.82 → 1575.30] it is absolutely dystopian oh yeah to have subscriptions tied to basically every bloody
[1575.30 → 1580.58] thing you own and no I don't think this one is one that has like a phone home there was definitely one
[1580.58 → 1584.74] that I saw at some point or maybe I'm imagining it I don't know, but that had like a home phone feet
[1584.74 → 1589.78] or a phone home feature so that it would actually call someone if you crashed oh okay and that was part
[1589.78 → 1595.62] of the justification for the subscription fee I remember forever ago we talked about this helmet
[1595.62 → 1602.82] that would deploy it wasn't like a motorcycle helmet it was a like a pedal biking sure fixed
[1602.82 → 1607.22] gear helmet um, and it would deploy over your head you wore it around your neck, and it would
[1607.22 → 1611.70] deploy over your head when you were falling uh, but it wouldn't do it if you weren't subscribed this
[1611.70 → 1619.22] was like a long time ago um and I was not a fan of that um but yeah you guys will have to tell me if
[1619.22 → 1626.02] this one actually fires off a why I don't fully understand yeah so you have to activate its sensor
[1626.02 → 1629.86] platform so is it sending data out, and then it's getting processed remotely all the time
[1630.74 → 1635.62] that I'm not sure but I wouldn't trust that yeah I wouldn't trust that either but that's a perfect
[1635.62 → 1642.82] segue into our next topic which is going to be UFC's up you see okay yeah what the heck is this okay
[1642.82 → 1648.98] this is bad and no, no don't read it all I'm gonna I'm going to read it out to you because it starts bad
[1648.98 → 1657.94] and then gets hilariously bad okay Dufy a sub brand of charger slash battery giant anchor has been caught
[1657.94 → 1664.74] sending pictures to their cloud servers without user consent oh to which you might say yeah surprise
[1664.74 → 1671.62] surprise but wait there's more Paul Moore a security consultant was reviewing the Dufy doorbell duel
[1671.62 → 1676.50] a camera equipped smart doorbell that claims that recorded footage will be kept private
[1676.50 → 1683.22] and stored locally with military grade encryption what does that mean that means aes-256 okay as far
[1683.22 → 1689.86] as I can tell nice but upon some snooping it turned out that Dufy was sending user data to the cloud
[1689.86 → 1694.98] including full resolution images from the camera despite claiming in their marketing materials that
[1694.98 → 1699.38] the files are stored locally and there's no cloud integration oh, oh there's a link we can actually
[1699.38 → 1708.66] check their website now ready have they updated no clouds or costs whoops daisies no cost because
[1708.66 → 1715.62] you're the product anyway I'm sorry um the files are not only uploaded to the cloud but also tagged with
[1715.62 → 1724.34] facial recognition that ties the images that ties the images to a user whoa okay it also takes a
[1724.34 → 1731.62] snapshot of the feed before a face was recognized and uploads that to the cloud as well, and it's not
[1731.62 → 1738.98] like Mr Moore is just making things up you know going on Mr Moore story time to make you feel bad other
[1738.98 → 1744.74] users have tested the same thing and found that the files were uploaded even when they had never used the
[1744.74 → 1754.34] web UI wow but wait it gets even better you might think that Mr Moore might have reached out to Dufy and
[1754.34 → 1764.02] been ignored yeah not so he reached out, and they replied saying that they were aware the photos were
[1764.02 → 1772.02] being uploaded and that it was for notification purposes no and that the pictures were deleted afterward
[1773.30 → 1781.70] oh they also said that they plan to encrypt the API messages no way you plan on doing this meaning
[1781.70 → 1786.98] well no, no this is I'm sure they do because that will make it harder for users to detect that their
[1786.98 → 1793.54] images are being uploaded that well no they didn't say the quiet part out loud okay, but they said that they
[1793.54 → 1799.54] will be encrypting the API messages yeah yeah further testing by Paul showed that this wasn't the case
[1799.54 → 1804.10] as after he deleted his pictures and notifications from the app he was still able to access the images
[1804.10 → 1816.58] hosted online oh no another user discovered that you can remotely start a stream and watch the
[1816.58 → 1820.58] unencrypted live camera feeds without authentication using VLC
[1824.58 → 1830.26] this is junk we used to do when I was in high school you can remotely start a stream
[1830.26 → 1841.38] and watch their cameras live no authentication no encryption oh hey, hey what's up Paul hey i actually
[1841.38 → 1846.74] didn't know that we were specifically called out that was Paul I believe so on Twitter um well great
[1846.74 → 1857.46] work Paul yeah, yeah great work indeed um this is a massive this is disgusting not just user data
[1857.46 → 1867.30] you know mishandling scandal this is a legal problem um apparently suffix did initially deny to Paul m what was
[1867.30 → 1875.62] going on um there's another thing in here where he deleted his or yeah I thought he said yeah yeah
[1875.62 → 1881.46] yeah uh oh so that's next oh wait oh he deleted his account all together never mind just deleting
[1881.46 → 1887.54] yeah so he deleted the pictures first off his local app or whatever and then later uh he found out that
[1887.54 → 1895.70] after deleting his account he could still access his photos wow, so their whole like we're we're
[1895.70 → 1901.38] getting rid of these we're recycling these things he was also able to access the aes-128 that's
[1901.38 → 1908.58] slightly less military grade encryption yeah the key in plain text by looking at the API calls neat so
[1908.58 → 1914.98] to recap it appears that suffix is storing images of faces with usernames attached to them on
[1914.98 → 1921.22] public facing servers without encryption they expose their own encryption keys in their API calls
[1921.22 → 1924.82] and allow users to access unencrypted streams without authentication
[1926.02 → 1933.78] our discussion question compared to previous breaches how bad is it bad yeah well it depends
[1933.78 → 1937.46] which breach you're talking about because we've had like there's the Australian breach where everyone's
[1937.46 → 1944.34] like passports leaked out um, but then there's been leaks breaches that aren't as bad so i yeah I don't
[1944.34 → 1951.46] know it's terrible though um how do we stop companies from being so uh um
[1953.14 → 1959.46] by suing them in ways that are actually meaningful yeah like not just cost of doing business fines
[1959.46 → 1965.78] like when something this bad happens you actually it needs to hurt to oblivion one of the biggest so that
[1965.78 → 1969.38] everyone else is afraid you make an example out of them we've talked about this on when show actually
[1969.38 → 1976.74] a bunch one of the biggest problems with tech lawsuits is it's often impactful amounts of
[1976.74 → 1981.70] money that they have to pay well it's not just that it's impactful it's that it takes so long
[1981.70 → 1986.98] to reach a verdict and with all the appeals and all the legal processes that you have to go through in
[1986.98 → 1994.42] order to actually reach the point where they pay a fine that the amount that they have probably made
[1994.42 → 2001.70] on that bad behaviour during that time dwarfs the cost of the fine it's not even just not matter
[2001.70 → 2008.34] it's not even just how much of a percentage of their overall revenue it is it's on a per illegal
[2008.34 → 2015.86] action basis that we're telling them it's worth it go for it yeah absolutely uh Cassandra asks are you
[2015.86 → 2020.02] guys going to continue working with anchor over this absolutely not you heard it here first we're done
[2020.02 → 2024.82] with anchor and that sucks because I really liked anchor yeah I've liked a lot of their products
[2024.82 → 2031.30] over the years that blows that is absolutely what we should be doing, but it just sucks yeah yeah um
[2033.06 → 2043.54] if Dufy smart scale is sending pictures of my balls and taint is that a bad thing um sorry is that
[2043.54 → 2049.62] one of our discussion question yeah um I started reading that before i uh you know
[2053.54 → 2059.46] this okay who wrote this topic this is the discussion question completely unaltered okay
[2060.18 → 2065.54] I have an Dufy smart scale is sending pictures of my balls and taint to the Chinese government
[2067.14 → 2072.34] that's what's written on the dog just says is I should have read the whole thing before I started
[2072.34 → 2087.86] actually reading it out loud is this one of those situations where they went on a walk with their
[2087.86 → 2094.90] cousins um uh wow um I don't know if the smart scale has a camera pointed up I probably doubt it
[2094.90 → 2104.18] I know I think it does what i I think so I thought it did hold on well let's look it up this is talking
[2104.18 → 2110.90] about like a smart doorbell not a scale hold on maybe it has a camera body fat scale
[2111.46 → 2118.26] body composite but i I don't know I don't know maybe it does maybe it does visceral fat like maybe it like
[2118.26 → 2125.54] looks at your tummy four sensors I don't know Luke I'm guessing
[2127.38 → 2132.90] uh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah when in the shower you need to spend more time
[2132.90 → 2138.58] scrubbing your nether regions I mean that's a notification some people could use notification
[2138.58 → 2142.82] brought to you by the UV smart scale
[2145.86 → 2150.90] be sure to check on what's going out front going on outside your friends doors by checking out our
[2150.90 → 2156.10] our unencrypted door cam I mean it might have a camera just because they're not advertising it
[2156.74 → 2160.42] they're doing all kinds of things they didn't say they were doing yeah there you go it's not like a
[2160.42 → 2167.06] little tiny pinhole camera costs anything pretty much it could easily have one yeah they know
[2167.06 → 2175.86] even 1080p wouldn't be that expensive yeah that was a creepy one right yeah we figured so I have
[2175.86 → 2182.74] that robot vacuum thing now and my girlfriend was showing me this super cool new feature of how you can
[2182.74 → 2190.58] call it, and you can see out the front, and you can talk through it and stuff, and she was like oh yeah i
[2190.58 → 2194.02] think it's I think it's cool I think it's just so like people can like talk to their pets and stuff
[2194.02 → 2201.46] and I'm like this is horrifying I hate this we're taping over this is not happening
[2204.58 → 2211.54] it's like not cool and a big problem there's no reason why my admittedly quite awesome I'm very
[2211.54 → 2218.74] happy with it yeah robot vacuum needs a camera that is accessible through like the internet and stuff
[2218.74 → 2230.26] um so yeah yeah anyway uh moving on from yeah let's talk about our Black Friday deal on LTT store
[2230.26 → 2236.98] it's big it's an it's a pretty big deal huge deal so if you head over to the store right now it's the

[2274.42 → 2279.30] thank you Mel science for sponsoring the show Mel science offers safe and exciting science
[2279.30 → 2283.78] experiments to do with your children oh cool they make learning feel like play so you can get your
[2283.78 → 2289.06] kids excited about math physics chemistry engineering and even medicine it's more than
[2289.06 → 2293.54] just science experiments though they offer immersive VR and AR lessons meaning that you and
[2293.54 → 2297.94] your family can see atoms up close in a way that yeah I never could when I was in high school
[2297.94 → 2303.54] chemistry we had to rely on literal chalkboard drawings uh kids want to do things like launch
[2303.54 → 2309.38] rockets off sofas and Mel's science Mel sciences VR courses make that possible without any damage to
[2309.38 → 2314.66] your ceiling so you know it's safer to have in your house than Dennis and Colton oh really right in the

[2322.58 → 2330.18] do you know that the top performing leg clip is me talking about the angriest I've ever been with an
[2330.18 → 2335.06] employee when like Dennis and Colton read my stuff do you know what percentage of the comments on that
[2335.06 → 2340.50] video are people being outraged because I'm asking inexperienced people to work on my house and therefore
[2340.50 → 2348.10] I shouldn't be surprised that it's damaged they weren't invited so if anyone wants to they were invaders if
[2348.10 → 2354.98] anyone wants to help a brother out go make sure people who are just not paying close enough
[2354.98 → 2360.02] attention or just the way people assume the worst sometimes you know yeah this is definitely
[2360.02 → 2365.78] a hundred percent my fault because I'm some kind of oppressive ogre not because two people utterly
[2365.78 → 2370.74] uninvited stuck into my house and damaged it i I don't think I don't think anyone should make that
[2370.74 → 2376.98] comment because now I have the right to go to your house and mess up anything I want you do the internet's

[2422.10 → 2432.98] oh man OLED TVs have gotten freaking cheap wow that's a 65 inch c1 so last gen for 1300
[2432.98 → 2440.74] bucks wow what the heck yeah save 800 I was going to say that sounds like it's that's normally a 2000 TV
[2440.74 → 2449.14] okay I'm not even just like this is not shilling you guys 32 inch 165 hertz g-sync compatible 170 bucks
[2449.14 → 2454.02] from LG what's the resolution of this though that's got to be 1080p you have to love processors on black
[2454.02 → 2459.06] Friday deals it's like 10 off yeah it's 1080p that's 1080p so that's a good deal, but that's not like
[2459.06 → 2470.74] like this TV uh 160 bucks 970 Eve 2 terabyte man SSDs have gotten so cheap I have no I don't
[2470.74 → 2477.06] understand Asus's zen book lineup but I do know that CPU is perfect and if this is a discrete
[2477.06 → 2484.18] GPU that has any kind of grunt whatsoever this looks pretty awesome yeah 3050 ti for 700 bucks
[2484.18 → 2490.26] with an OLED display wow there's actually some there's some damn good deals in here yeah huh
[2491.54 → 2494.66] you can get the quest 2 for the price that we used to pay for it
[2496.58 → 2503.46] because it comes with a couple of games for 350 bucks which is um kind of like 300 bucks plus games
[2503.46 → 2509.54] if you were going this is a weird one but if you were going to spend a hundred dollars on the Microsoft
[2509.54 → 2518.18] Xbox store anyway this is a hundred dollar gift card that is 13 off oh okay i think so it
[2518.18 → 2525.14] says a hundred dollars yeah okay oh with promo code okay so you have to put that in no plus 13 off of
[2525.14 → 2531.62] promo code so yeah I think it's 13 off yeah so it's its free money essentially yeah selling a hundred dollar
[2531.62 → 2541.14] bills for 87 dollars seems like a pretty good play yeah all right cool oh man you want to see
[2541.14 → 2548.66] me go on another rant let's talk about let's talk about tax software if you guys want I'm not
[2548.66 → 2553.22] going to do it I'm not going to do it but if you guys want to get into it, you want to go down a rabbit
[2553.22 → 2563.70] hole go learn about how through the magic of lobbying quick tax basically created a moat
[2563.70 → 2572.18] around their utterly unnecessary biz uh personal tax uh reporting software and made it so that uh
[2572.18 → 2577.78] something that shouldn't exist at shouldn't need to exist at all is like a billion-dollar business or
[2577.78 → 2584.34] whatever there's some there are some clips speakers I'm actually like they're normally 460 dollars
[2584.34 → 2590.50] around for 200 bucks speakers are often something that you want to shop for around Black Friday because
[2590.50 → 2598.98] they're a low volume high margin category, and it's its very they're one of those industries that is
[2598.98 → 2604.82] highly protective so they um they're one of the're one like uh home appliances they'll
[2604.82 → 2608.34] create different part numbers for different retailers so that it's really hard to price
[2608.34 → 2612.98] compare and stuff like that so that might be an amazing deal I just don't know I'm going to have to
[2612.98 → 2617.86] I'm going to have to talk to some people I don't know like anything oh it's like the clip sale yeah
[2619.22 → 2624.10] reference cinema Dolby Atmos 5.1.4 system normally a thousand dollars for 400 bucks
[2625.22 → 2630.50] um guys maybe just hit up Luke let him know if these are actually good deals I know nothing about
[2630.50 → 2634.50] this stuff like do you want to do you want like a home theatre speaker setup I do
[2634.50 → 2639.14] oh I have nothing it's just playing through my TV right oh Black Friday is the way to do it yeah
[2639.14 → 2643.54] you should actually order something today I've been yeah I've been waiting yeah that's
[2643.54 → 2649.78] the U.S. site by the way but yeah, but you might still be able to find some good deals if glitch
[2649.78 → 2656.10] if clips is running promos for Black Friday it's quite likely that newegg.ca also has it right yeah
[2656.10 → 2660.50] I might like actually look into those the show is also brought to you by Messi
[2660.50 → 2668.02] Messi footwear is known for offering lightweight and easy to pack sneakers with what Messi says is
[2668.02 → 2673.62] waterproof what I feel is more water-resistant because water can literally cut canyons into the
[2673.62 → 2680.58] earth but in fairness to them highly in my opinion water-resistant waterproof material that offers you
[2680.58 → 2686.26] reassurance when the weather can't simply decide which shoes to wear in the morning uh gets a lot
[2686.26 → 2690.50] easier when you have Messi's because you can ignore the uncertainty of weather patterns your
[2690.50 → 2695.06] feet will stay warm in the winter cool in the summer and dry in the rain putting them on and
[2695.06 → 2698.90] taking them off is easy, and their shoes are made from cruelty-free products right down to the glue
[2698.90 → 2703.22] Messi is currently giving away a hundred pairs of free socks to the first people to use code
[2703.22 → 2708.82] socks wan show at the link down below so check out their early black Friday
[2708.82 → 2712.90] check out their Black Friday sale at vessi.com slash wan show it can't be that early I mean it's black
[2712.90 → 2717.30] Friday isn't it right yeah it's Black Friday yep I thought this was Black Friday maybe this was
[2717.30 → 2724.90] written like too long ago yeah that makes sense all right what do you want to talk about now I need
[2724.90 → 2730.90] to get away from looking at speakers oh no full plane chat is hilarious at Luke you will not buy anything
[2732.42 → 2739.70] got him I'm allowed to i I likely won't but I'm allowed to buy things sometimes okay got him I spent
[2739.70 → 2745.30] a bunch of money on my trip jay schmaltz no says just grab something from the office we actually
[2745.30 → 2750.02] don't have a lot of speakers just like hanging around I have, but you spend money on travel he
[2750.02 → 2755.70] spends money on experiences he just doesn't spend money on products yeah yeah yeah I'm still running
[2755.70 → 2760.18] my computer speakers I'm not that interested in upgrading um and I'm still running that corsair
[2760.18 → 2765.14] system that we both had like the SP 2500 yeah yeah they're fine I don't I don't need anyone's there
[2765.14 → 2770.18] I just running off like anytime we watch anything on my TV which is not that common but when we do
[2770.18 → 2775.14] having it just pipe through the TV like it's a good TV it has decent built-in speakers, but they're
[2775.14 → 2782.34] built-in speakers but um they could be a lot better oh yeah you should just talk to dank pots and well
[2782.82 → 2787.38] here's the thing just because someone's into audio and knows audio doesn't mean that they've taken the
[2787.38 → 2794.18] time to familiarize themselves with the entire product lineup of every audio brands because it's
[2794.18 → 2797.46] basically impossible that is a pretty good point that I might actually just do that
[2798.74 → 2802.66] although I like talking to him anyway yeah it might be just an excuse um
[2804.26 → 2808.98] what should we talk about next man my hot take count is pretty high today we've got taxes
[2808.98 → 2815.70] suffix looking at your balls nothing is waterproof I'm doing great I'm doing great uh speaking of
[2815.70 → 2822.74] hot takes and things should we talk about this week in twitter I can go through it sure okay cool we are
[2822.74 → 2830.50] going to go through in chronological order starting on Friday the 18th Elon tweeted out new Twitter
[2830.50 → 2836.66] policy is freedom of speech but not freedom of reach negative slash hate tweets will be max
[2837.30 → 2844.42] boosted and also demonetized Elon clarified that this applies to the individual tweet not the account
[2844.42 → 2852.82] um and what is a negative tweet question mark was asked um, and it doesn't 100 seem like anyone can
[2852.82 → 2857.62] really answer that right so basically it's exactly the same problem that we've had with twitter all
[2857.62 → 2866.02] this time nice nice nice there is um twitter did have some stuff that defined hate speech, and he has not
[2866.02 → 2871.14] changed that so maybe that's what they're using this is a guess completely out of the air from me, I have
[2871.14 → 2876.34] no reason to actually believe this maybe that's what they're using I don't know another option is
[2876.34 → 2882.50] that they're using nothing and this system doesn't exist which is I think is what's more real because
[2882.50 → 2888.42] he didn't say it said new twitter policy is this thing it doesn't say that the tools to do this have
[2888.42 → 2894.26] been made and are being used and I suspect that they have not been made and are not being used got it
[2894.26 → 2900.90] um but I don't know Saturday the 19th Elon reed states can I just can i hold on I'm so sorry
[2900.90 → 2906.58] can I jump in for a second here absolutely so the whole freedom of reach thing yes and suppressing
[2907.22 → 2910.66] so I don't I don't think it's someone asked in flow plane chat and I think this is where you're
[2910.66 → 2916.34] going as well I don't think this is shadow-banning well, and it isn't it's its shadow suppressing as
[2916.34 → 2920.66] close to shadow-banning as you can get without just saying shadow-banning pretty much
[2920.66 → 2925.78] like I think you could go to this person's my guesstimating yeah is you could go to this
[2925.78 → 2929.94] person's account and see it which means it's not shadow-banned yeah well I mean but I think it's just
[2929.94 → 2935.38] not going to be promoted on the home feed well yeah but if it's is it's algorithmically suppressed
[2935.38 → 2941.70] isn't that exactly what many of the groups who were so happy about Elon taking over have been mad
[2941.70 → 2948.42] about on other platforms yep algorithmically suppressing what they're saying so than we all agree that
[2948.42 → 2955.22] that's bad and that there should be um you know what i I don't know I just can't anymore
[2955.22 → 2960.34] uh it's at the very least not not not what he was uh theoretically coming in for right but yeah
[2960.34 → 2964.98] anyway Saturday the 19th immediately after that he says he's reinstating a number of prominent
[2964.98 → 2971.70] suspended accounts along with Trump's after 15 million users voted on a twitter poll with 51.8
[2971.70 → 2982.82] 8.8 voting yes and 48.2 voting no Elon claims 134 million of twitter's nearly 400 million users
[2982.82 → 2993.14] have seen this poll democracy Sunday was the sabbath nothing happened on Sunday uh there is something
[2993.14 → 2998.10] that's not in here that there are many things don't know too much about there was a whole thing with like
[2998.10 → 3005.22] um uh there was a whole thing discussing like uh child exploitation hashtags or something like that
[3005.22 → 3010.74] I don't know enough about it because there's stuff that went down with Balenciaga that I know enough
[3010.74 → 3015.22] about to talk outside of yeah that we can that we can talk about a little bit later but no this was a
[3015.22 → 3020.18] separate thing it was like hashtags that are apparently used for sharing uh compromising material
[3020.18 → 3027.30] um and twitter for a long time had not done enough to block those hashtags oh, and they've actually
[3027.30 → 3030.26] done something and have actually done something about it now so I want to make sure that in all
[3030.26 → 3036.74] of this chaos we are putting good things as well things that at least seem to be going well as well
[3036.74 → 3043.14] yeah so I heard about that during the reading about the Balenciaga thing that went down um and so yeah
[3043.14 → 3048.82] that that is actually that's that's fantastic the fact that is something that I hated about twitter in the
[3048.82 → 3055.78] past was that they were just like openly refusing to deal with obvious pedophilia on the platform yep
[3055.78 → 3060.82] uh which is just ridiculous and unacceptable, and now it has been dealt with which is great at least
[3060.82 → 3067.06] somewhat right at least somewhat I mean to say it's its dealt with I think is too much of a pretty
[3067.06 → 3072.58] optimistic yeah uh but at least some amount of step has been done to make it not as bad as it was I'll say
[3072.58 → 3081.38] that much uh Monday the 21st Elon uh delays relaunch of blue verified previously set for November 29th
[3081.38 → 3086.82] uh until there is high confidence of stopping impersonation mentioned using different
[3086.82 → 3094.58] coloured check marks good luck with that uh yeah uh Wednesday the 23rd buddy tweets another poll
[3094.58 → 3104.10] asking if Twitter should offer general amnesty to suspended accounts three million votes 72.4
[3104.10 → 3111.14] saying yes 27.6 saying no it's interesting that he's tweeting it, and it's not a poll that the
[3111.14 → 3117.22] platform is sending out because I wonder what the demographics following Elon are moving forward
[3117.22 → 3125.14] Friday the 25th Elon tweets what he's now calling verified is tentatively set to launch Friday
[3125.14 → 3133.38] December 2nd now with fun new colours companies get gold government uh representatives get gray individuals
[3133.38 → 3140.02] get blue and can also have a secondary tiny logo whatever that means showing that they belong to an
[3140.02 → 3147.14] org all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates have fun sending your
[3147.14 → 3152.58] personal identification to twitter that is already something you had to do but still um also if apple
[3152.58 → 3160.50] slash google boots twitter from their app stores Elon will just make a phone what yeah that went really
[3160.50 → 3168.18] well for the Zuck cool discussion question can any social media platform owned by a private corporation
[3168.18 → 3174.98] really be a town square or do we need an almost certainly worse government owned platform I just threw
[3174.98 → 3180.42] my mouth a little bit I have said that before to no there are problems across the board it has to be
[3180.42 → 3185.54] decentralized, and it has to actually be outside any individual's control at which point it will
[3185.54 → 3193.54] turn into a cluster, and basically it doesn't work we should all abandon social media nice wow I thought
[3193.54 → 3198.90] I was going to be with one with the hot takes today I hate it all you just won you just won the hot take
[3198.90 → 3205.78] yeah Olympics yeah as much as mastodon is not going to work mastodon's idea of joining servers
[3206.58 → 3211.22] I think is the and like Facebook's thing where you theoretically just interact with people in your
[3211.22 → 3214.90] friends group google's old thing where you theoretically only interacted with people in your
[3214.90 → 3220.42] circles stuff like that I think that's the only form that is really going to work mastodon to be
[3220.42 → 3225.30] very clear tons of massive issues I saw some people tweeting out recently like I wish people didn't
[3225.30 → 3229.94] talk down on mastodon being hard to use because it's not that hard to use and people should use it
[3229.94 → 3235.38] so we can get off of twitter yeah if you join someone's server thing as weird as that is they can read
[3235.38 → 3239.94] all of your personal messages by the way hope you knew that there are lots of problems with mastodon
[3239.94 → 3246.18] it's garbage don't use it in my opinion that is entirely just my opinion wow he's spicy today
[3247.54 → 3253.22] they all suck they're all terrible just because Twitter is up in fire doesn't mean the rest aren't on fire
[3253.22 → 3260.82] as well okay come on oh we don't need this type of thing people act like the only possible way you
[3260.82 → 3266.50] can get news in the modern era is to look on Twitter that is not true there is lots of other
[3266.50 → 3271.06] ways that it can work including Reddit which has been around this whole time you think people don't
[3271.06 → 3278.18] get news on Reddit are you crazy you think Reddit isn't fast as heck would you have ever in a thousand
[3278.18 → 3286.66] years imagined yourself saying no Reddit will be our station we did it Reddit i just it's better
[3286.66 → 3293.78] than twitter oh man yeah I don't know okay we don't need twitter it is not a requirement just because
[3293.78 → 3301.86] you can't get off it doesn't mean that we need it okay MythBusters 123 in float plane says Balenciaga
[3301.86 → 3311.06] yeah needs to be boycotted can I jump in with a hot take okay why the f**k were you ever buying
[3311.06 → 3317.14] anything from Balenciaga anyway not a hot take are you made of money it's so
[3319.14 → 3324.10] the amount of Balenciaga shoes I saw on my trip was disappointing i would see someone walk by
[3324.10 → 3329.22] and be like what is that why is it doing this on your foot and then I'd be like oh it's one of those
[3329.22 → 3334.02] those Balenciaga shoes not those just look like converse that are way too expensive for no
[3334.02 → 3340.66] reason this is 950 Canadian dollars it looks like converse with a Hitler's stash you know what's on
[3340.66 → 3348.90] the front of it okay did you see did you see that oh it's just the text
[3348.90 → 3357.30] are you okay today do you need you are you okay to stay live yeah because you're spicy I'll be
[3357.30 → 3364.90] all right I'll be all right the point is the way that I see the way that I see a garment
[3364.90 → 3373.30] like this, and it's funny to me that in the mainstream it's its okay to flex by spending 950
[3373.30 → 3379.70] dollars on basic shoes yeah, but you're an idiot for spending eight dollars on a check mark on Twitter
[3379.70 → 3386.26] yes that's funny they're the same thing they are both just spending money to demonstrate
[3386.26 → 3392.26] that you had money that you couldn't have possibly used for anything else yeah that's the only reason
[3392.26 → 3399.70] they exist yeah, yeah so do we talk about what happened to them yeah they apologized and
[3399.70 → 3406.42] stuff did you see that I saw they apologized but like how did it possibly get that far well so they
[3406.42 → 3410.98] they had a campaign or something I don't even know what it was I don't even really care it was these
[3410.98 → 3418.90] weird was it the doll thing yeah they were purses that looked like stuffed animals in like um like sum
[3418.90 → 3430.26] garb yeah yeah um and the photo shoot had had kids in it like actual like young
[3430.26 → 3436.34] children all children which is really weird off the bat just due to the subject of what
[3436.34 → 3441.70] they're trying to sell which was already really weird off the bat two really weird things these
[3441.70 → 3447.14] things should not be together right yeah okay sounds good but I think that was the point of the campaign
[3447.14 → 3458.50] on the desk yeah there were papers yes and without intense levels of sleuthing but by like zooming in
[3458.50 → 3464.58] a little bit and turning it so that it was you know the right side up you could see that these were papers
[3464.58 → 3474.98] about court cases about that basically were loopholes um for the I forget if it was the
[3474.98 → 3481.86] the distribution of or the ownership of uh base but basically child pornographic material yeah now
[3482.50 → 3489.46] what I will say I haven't seen their apology what I will say is that it is possible think about the
[3489.46 → 3497.46] kinds of artiste people you've met in your life it is possible that it's somewhere other than Valencia
[3497.46 → 3508.34] Balenciaga's legal executive level it is possible that somewhere someone was trying to be edgy and made
[3508.34 → 3515.94] that decision without informing someone it's just so uncomfortable however the campaign which was
[3515.94 → 3524.74] obviously designed to generate shock must have been approved at a high enough level that I'm just not
[3524.74 → 3530.66] really willing to give them a pass on it that's kind of where I'm at on it, I do think that certain
[3530.66 → 3540.58] aspects of it might have happened by accident but what I don't think is that this was an oh, oh we had no
[3540.58 → 3546.18] idea this was going to be controversial no, no you knew you're 100 knew that's why you did it
[3546.18 → 3555.14] like i I've had the experience being the executive of a company where something happens a decision gets
[3555.14 → 3560.66] made absolutely something gets communicated and I didn't know and I'm furious and that's not what i
[3560.66 → 3566.02] would have done yeah I've had that experience yeah and I'm sure for some people at Balenciaga that's
[3566.02 → 3573.70] what's happening right now they're going how could this possibly have happened, but they also can't
[3573.70 → 3579.46] pretend that people who have been entrusted with the brand some of them at least were not involved
[3579.46 → 3586.74] in this happening where's the parents of these kids um there's like i I can't find it, but they like
[3587.62 → 3595.86] Instagrammer out um some things uh apologizing or whatever and I think they are going after
[3595.86 → 3601.78] yeah they so they filed the 25 million dollar suit against the producers of the advertising campaign
[3601.78 → 3609.86] mm-hmm um so theoretically it was done outside of company yeah okay so then yeah I told you I hadn't
[3609.86 → 3613.54] seen the apology, but that sounds like yeah the kind of thing that would happen, but the thing is
[3615.14 → 3621.30] someone must have seen we've talked I think we've talked a lot about the agency structure right where
[3621.30 → 3629.22] companies hire agencies, and they hire agencies so that everyone who works on their marketing is a
[3629.22 → 3635.30] contractor who works for a separate third party and so that they can quickly and easily a get rid of
[3635.30 → 3641.30] them or b absolve themselves of any responsibility for what their agencies do that's the whole point
[3642.02 → 3648.18] but it doesn't work you're still responsible for it so you might as well just have a team of people
[3648.18 → 3654.18] internally who understand your brand and know what the're doing and this is case in point
[3654.90 → 3662.50] right here this demonstrates why I was right about that all along that's why we don't have and that's
[3662.50 → 3667.38] why I don't have an agent that's why we don't have an outside marketing agency because who could
[3667.38 → 3673.38] possibly understand us and our story better than the people who work here and interact with us every day
[3673.38 → 3680.18] yeah then you don't have this problem yeah you're welcome Balenciaga it was a lesson on how to not be
[3680.18 → 3685.86] just utterly irresponsible if people are wondering like how the heck we got onto that topic a lot of
[3685.86 → 3692.18] that went down on Twitter yeah um so that was a thing that happened on Twitter that's what we were
[3692.18 → 3696.98] talking about before it was twitter stuff so yeah that was disgusting uh we didn't screen share any
[3696.98 → 3699.94] of the images and stuff and I highly recommend you don't look them up because they're honestly very
[3699.94 → 3706.34] disturbing but moving on to uh more potentially positive things I don't know if you're ready maybe it is it in
[3706.34 → 3713.22] in my email as well on here um we have images of things that might be interesting to see oh oh oh
[3713.22 → 3717.70] right I forgot nick was there he crouched and then I totally forgot about him, I don't think they were
[3717.70 → 3722.82] sent to my email I'm sorry nick uh what email am I supposed to be checking for this I think it's just
[3722.82 → 3732.74] that pc this one's doesn't have it yeah this one's also a different email uh let's see hey here we go
[3732.74 → 3740.34] all right we got some stuff to talk to you guys about we were thinking of making a wallet and i
[3740.34 → 3746.02] suspect you're pretty similar to me in that the only wallets I've ever used in my life are ones that
[3746.02 → 3753.38] people gave me that's actually not true really are you a wallet guy I had no I had a wallet uh
[3753.38 → 3760.90] break in half while I was on a trip for work okay so I bought a new one, and it's okay but other than
[3760.90 → 3766.42] that it's still here I've had it for eight years okay um actually here one sec hey Dan do you mind
[3767.14 → 3770.98] moving the camera a little bit I think when we adjusted things earlier I wasn't sitting how i usually
[3770.98 → 3776.66] sit and so it's really it's been looking really dumb I'll show thanks just go that way a bit oh
[3776.66 → 3783.70] uh yeah oh no the other way yeah that way thanks uh anywho so okay well I am definitely the kind of
[3783.70 → 3790.10] person who just uses whatever wallet people give me for Christmas because I just cannot be arsed yeah
[3790.10 → 3795.70] before this one it was one of those yeah my understanding now is that your wallet is like a
[3795.70 → 3800.90] huge status symbol because I think it always has been no, no I know well oh it always has been
[3800.90 → 3806.02] I just am an idiot and didn't know that oh I just didn't care yeah so so so your wallet's a status
[3806.02 → 3811.06] symbol because it's like the thing that you use to carry your money and you when you pull it out and
[3811.06 → 3817.86] pay it's like good for it to have like good uh pictures on it that mean like good money inside
[3817.86 → 3822.34] right yeah like the person who owns the company that sold you the wallet is really rich because you're
[3822.34 → 3828.10] dumb that thing got it yeah that's a good one nice so we were going to do a wallet that was you know
[3828.10 → 3834.34] I don't know high quality but not outlandishly priced but because i just kind of use whatever
[3834.34 → 3840.18] people give me I don't have strong opinions about what makes a good wallet so we had Matthew from the
[3840.18 → 3847.62] creator warehouse team uh mock up some wallets fire them over to me and I'm going to try to find a
[3847.62 → 3856.34] safe way to uh show these to you guys without doing anything stupid uh how about like this ah yes this
[3856.34 → 3864.90] looks pretty good okay yes oh whoops well spoiler we're also thinking about doing a tie hey that's
[3864.90 → 3869.38] cool that goes with the party shirt yeah that was kind of the idea it's uh the party shirt print okay
[3869.38 → 3873.78] I guess we're going to talk about the tie first the thing with the tie is I want to make sure that we
[3873.78 → 3880.10] are we're differentiating in some way like we're okay uh, so comments under the video are going to be the
[3880.10 → 3885.54] way to interact with this discussion by the way guys um we want to differentiate in some way like one of the
[3885.54 → 3891.22] ideas that I thought of is that it could come pre-tied oh that's actually not a bad idea
[3892.98 → 3899.94] yeah okay or instead of being like a cringe clip on or like having a zipper down the thing like
[3899.94 → 3906.98] this yeah uh one idea I thought of is that it could this could be like a separate piece that goes on over
[3906.98 → 3913.22] top, and it just like kind of runs through here so that you can still adjust the length, but it's you
[3913.22 → 3919.70] never have to tie it I'm I probably exists already but like I just wanted to I wanted to make it us in
[3919.70 → 3924.26] some way, but anyway these are some designs that Matthew threw together cool that he thought you guys
[3924.26 → 3929.54] might like to look at and give us the second one yeah give us some feedback on here are some more
[3930.10 → 3936.58] kind of fun ones yeah uh this is there we go that's a like fun ties yeah i just I don't know who wears a
[3936.58 → 3942.58] tie anymore I don't know like I want to do a float plane pole maybe sure like do people do you actually
[3942.58 → 3948.42] wear ties I think a lot of like nerds and developers don't wear ties, so this might be skewed well that's
[3948.42 → 3955.54] the thing right that's our audience so yeah, yeah fair enough, and we're already working on
[3955.54 → 3961.94] some just really clean like comfortable like office attire you know that hides pit stains you
[3961.94 → 3969.38] know like really practical stuff yeah um I just don't know if we need a tie wow a surprising amount
[3969.38 → 3976.34] of people just right off the hop are saying yes oh 30 of people are saying yes off the top 34 it's going
[3976.34 → 3983.54] up 35 okay well all right then interesting observation the people devote yes to wearing a tie
[3984.10 → 3991.46] came to the poll slower than the people to say no huh okay the numbers who feel strongly about no ties
[3991.46 → 3996.34] 37 now it's slowly increasing people are passionate about no ties yeah yeah all right that's fair
[3996.34 → 4001.22] that's fair that's a very surprising amount of people uh, so this is the wallet uh we were thinking
[4001.22 → 4007.06] that actually looks pretty sharp either leather uh or the same material as our yeah the same material
[4007.06 → 4013.78] as our backpack um Matthew was thinking of doing a zipper around it, I personally find the zipper to be a
[4013.78 → 4019.86] little late 90s yeah uh or mid 90s yep I don't know if I'm that down for the zipper wallet I also am
[4019.86 → 4024.74] not super into the square wallet but one of the things that Matthew brought up is that around the
[4024.74 → 4031.22] world uh money is shaped very differently yes and square wallets even if we don't do only square
[4031.22 → 4037.30] wallets could be a necessary evil for people who for example use euros which are quite, quite square
[4037.30 → 4042.90] compared to like Canadian us uh I think Australian money is I don't remember if you're widescreen
[4042.90 → 4048.74] widescreen aspect ratio there's some that change size depending on denomination as well I believe euros are
[4048.74 → 4054.98] different sizes yeah okay so that's the wallet um and just you know any feedback you guys have in
[4054.98 → 4058.10] the comments under this video that's where we're going to want to see it this is the small it
[4058.98 → 4062.74] okay interesting, so this is just a card wallet basically yeah this is more like what I would
[4062.74 → 4068.02] probably use although I carry a lot of cards, and they were asking me they're like why do you have so
[4068.02 → 4072.66] many cards I'm sitting here going well I don't want to yeah personal debit business debit personal
[4072.66 → 4078.90] Canadian credit card personal us dollar credit card business Canadian credit card business us dollar
[4078.90 → 4088.58] credit card uh my identification my Costco card my um triple a membership my um uh parks and rec card
[4088.58 → 4094.74] I'm up to 10 cards already I don't even have any money in my pocket yet all the same for me minus two of
[4094.74 → 4101.78] the business ones but not all four just two of them yeah yep okay so i have to carry a decent
[4101.78 → 4106.50] amount of cards so what i kind of want is like a thick small it I think that's the one that
[4106.50 → 4115.14] I'm most into um this one I've already approved I love this concept for a passport case
[4115.14 → 4120.58] so you can have all your cards in there uh it's just it's uh it's especially if it's you already said
[4120.58 → 4124.90] it's the same material as the backpack right that'd be pretty sweet to have the pairing or it might
[4124.90 → 4129.54] be leather here backpack material here or something like that or two different dyed leathers uh we're
[4129.54 → 4133.70] experimenting with different kinds of leathers uh some of them are like vegan leathers but like
[4134.98 → 4141.86] not bad though I've seen mushroom leathers that blew my mind yeah like pineapple leather like apple leather
[4142.58 → 4147.54] it's its getting perfect so we'll see and then this would be more like a cardholder one
[4147.54 → 4152.58] so if you have any uh if you have any feedback on any of this stuff we are absolutely looking
[4152.58 → 4156.50] for it, and we'd love to we'd love to hear what you guys have to say yeah
[4158.98 → 4167.22] uh I think that's it for that part should we talk about the bonus topics or should we go into meta
[4168.26 → 4175.46] uh let's go into meta okay it's long we should do a couple merch messages okay uh poor Dan um has
[4175.46 → 4179.62] already dealt with 200 merch messages how you're doing over there Dan my fingers hurt
[4180.90 → 4186.02] no I'm doing well it's uh lots of good questions coming in today all right that's awesome deal
[4186.02 → 4190.74] that's awesome yeah we're also yeah a lot of orders coming in for the wan show combo I mean you guys
[4190.74 → 4196.18] can see them flooding in down here um so yeah let's do let's do a couple merch messages hit me Dan
[4196.18 → 4199.38] what is on your Christmas list this year ask Jason
[4199.38 → 4206.58] uh my whole family just perked up because I have not posted my Christmas list yet oh I don't know
[4206.58 → 4211.94] what I want I don't want anything well you just said you want to surround sound speaker setup that's
[4211.94 → 4216.82] too much though yeah that's my problem everything I want is something I could never ask anyone else to
[4216.82 → 4224.02] give me yeah because if it's like 20 bucks I'll just get it if I actually want it most of you just
[4224.02 → 4228.10] well I don't want it yeah and if you don't want it badly enough to spend 20 bucks on it, you can't
[4228.10 → 4233.06] why would someone else spend 20 bucks for someone else to spend 20 bucks yeah you know hard you know
[4233.06 → 4240.26] what I asked for Christmas I asked for us to not do a gift exchange whoa I hate gift exchanges
[4241.14 → 4245.62] wait what do you mean by gift exchange I hate exchanging Christmas presents gifts at all yeah i just i
[4245.62 → 4252.26] don't want any and I don't want to buy any or if is we buy you something like there are people in our
[4252.26 → 4258.42] lives that we buy things for a lot actually like my aunt um Yvonne's parents uh we've gotten both of
[4258.42 → 4264.02] them cars we've gotten both of them multiple vacations uh they do a lot for us, I've talked
[4264.02 → 4268.90] about this before but with the amount of child care that they do for us, we're probably ahead on the deal
[4268.90 → 4274.98] child care is so expensive um so like there's people that we absolutely buy things for
[4275.78 → 4281.62] but I don't like buying junk I don't like I don't like just getting people junk to put in their house
[4281.62 → 4286.90] and I feel like a lot of the time with the reasonable with a reasonable budget gift exchange
[4286.90 → 4295.06] that's what everyone ends up doing you just go to some gift guide find some junk and then expect it
[4295.06 → 4299.38] to be in someone's house when you visit them, and it just creates all this pressure and like
[4299.38 → 4305.62] this guilt if your junk is not as good as their junk like i just i I hate it my family's Christmas has
[4305.62 → 4311.46] always been very epic um but even when we like didn't have money and didn't have a lot of gift
[4311.46 → 4317.94] exchange it was always we just found other ways to make it cool um and the gift exchange has been
[4317.94 → 4324.10] become a little bit more serious as people have become a little bit more successful um but like myself and
[4324.10 → 4330.66] my dad are the notoriously like ridiculously hard people to shop for um and whenever I complain
[4330.66 → 4337.46] about my dad everyone snips it me because they're like you're just as hard um so like I can't imagine
[4337.46 → 4340.74] other people that have to shop for both of us because like neither of us want anything
[4342.42 → 4348.10] and just to clarify ken k over on float plane says no adult gift exchange right oh yeah Christmas is for
[4348.10 → 4353.78] kids oh yeah like my oh man I'm excited about buying for the little one my side of the family
[4353.78 → 4360.50] has been doing a gift exchange all the way into adulthood for us and as soon as Yvonne and I had
[4360.50 → 4366.98] kids we were sitting here going why on earth are you guys spending any money on us this is ridiculous
[4366.98 → 4374.02] we'll participate in stupid the stupid secret Santa stupid gift exchange but don't buy anything for us
[4374.02 → 4379.86] buy stuff for our kids I do like I do like buying stuff for my mom I do like buying stuff for my
[4379.86 → 4385.22] brother my brother and my mom everybody else seems to have a when they
[4388.34 → 4393.14] when they do figure out something for me, it's usually like oh wow i never really would have
[4393.14 → 4399.46] thought about that yeah which is why it's so hard and this is cool, but sorry for the intense labour of
[4399.46 → 4406.82] trying to figure something out so I like feel bad, but it's its cool um so I don't know Conrad it's
[4406.82 → 4410.82] tough Conrad goes I like giving gifts a lot receiving gifts is okay, but it's way more fun
[4410.82 → 4416.50] to give people things what you're giving them is an obligation you're giving them pressure sometimes
[4416.50 → 4422.02] that's how I feel, but that's the thing I know that's how you should respect how other people feel
[4422.02 → 4429.22] about it yes yeah when people who just love giving gifts give me stuff it makes me uncomfortable I don't
[4429.22 → 4435.38] like it, I don't want it and when I say I really don't want anything I'm not like I really don't want
[4435.38 → 4441.94] anything but like oh if you got me something no I really don't want anything listen to the words I'm
[4441.94 → 4446.10] saying yeah and I don't I don't know there's just there 's's been there 's's a lot of
[4446.10 → 4450.02] frustration because and I mean maybe part of it is just like my upbringing right because I've run
[4450.02 → 4454.74] into situations where people have given me something that they thought I would love, and then it's like
[4454.74 → 4459.14] extremely hurtful and puts like strain on the relationship when I didn't want it and don't like it
[4459.14 → 4466.50] when I said I didn't want it and I didn't like it give me a break yeah yeah yeah that's I think it
[4466.50 → 4472.18] helps in my family that I don't think it's like that for anyone um, but that's also a reason why
[4472.18 → 4478.18] you and I have never done gift exchange between us ever yeah there are lots of good suggestions in
[4478.18 → 4485.06] the chat though like uh you can donate um to like you know uh a shelter that's a cool one in people's
[4485.06 → 4491.46] names and stuff like that totally 100 super down give food that's our fallback whenever
[4491.46 → 4497.26] we're not sure what to do is we just like give people fancy food um to be clear I don't want that
[4497.26 → 4504.68] either like the amount of food that arrives in my name here every year yeah I don't I i I promise you
[4504.68 → 4509.50] there's only one thing I eat it's the little chocolate covered cookies from Noctua everything
[4509.50 → 4513.76] else and I usually don't even finish them because I don't want like that many treats in my life
[4513.76 → 4519.08] and that's almost because it's more of a tradition thing all the rest of it all the rest of it goes
[4519.08 → 4524.50] straight to the staff like kitchen and other people eat it so if you were thinking that you were
[4524.50 → 4530.42] sending Linus some kind of like special treat to try I'm not eating it I'm giving it to the people
[4530.42 → 4535.72] here which is fine like by all means like send stuff and people will eat it I'm talking to
[4535.72 → 4540.84] brands don't make things yeah I'm talking to brands right now who are sensible enough to send
[4540.84 → 4548.14] things that are sealed um buy twitter blue buy people twitter blue for Christmas okay that's
[4548.14 → 4559.54] pretty funny oh no anyway uh moving on should we do another one should we jump back to topics yeah
[4559.54 → 4566.16] let's do another one question for Luke if the roles were reversed would you have hired Linus for Luke tech
[4566.16 → 4572.70] tips 14 years ago no yeah yes I would and Linus uh the I'll have to say that 650s and silver look
[4572.70 → 4581.94] amazing why would I not have I don't know yeah I mean would be kind of dumb okay, but the roles are
[4581.94 → 4587.92] reversed so you're the one with the channel and I'm just like a guy like would you have gotten along
[4587.92 → 4592.48] with me that well in an interview like would you like that's what people are asking do you remember
[4592.48 → 4595.72] how long our interview was oh yeah that's true we chatted for like a couple of hours I think we got
[4595.72 → 4599.70] along pretty well yeah okay when else what happens you meet your soul mate I think it was more
[4599.70 → 4605.74] I think it was more than a couple of hours because I showed up when I mean immediately after school
[4605.74 → 4610.14] and then the bus systems were closed by the end of the interview you had to drive me home okay I think
[4610.14 → 4616.06] it was like a day our interview was like eight hours, and it was after hours so it didn't matter
[4616.06 → 4621.08] like I wasn't being paid for the time anyway so yeah okay no i yeah that rings I think it probably
[4621.08 → 4627.80] would have worked good like i yeah I don't I don't see that not having happened okay yeah fair
[4627.80 → 4633.30] enough yeah should we get back to topics sure we got to leave some merch messages for the end
[4633.30 → 4640.22] I mean there's a lot there is but okay yeah anyway meta is going hard on AI as if we didn't already
[4640.22 → 4645.42] know that and uh we're probably doomed I'm not sure what that means yet, but we'll get there oh we'll
[4645.42 → 4652.28] get there meta's been struggling lately uh with a layoff of 11 000 employees following economic
[4652.28 → 4659.04] forecasts that you know didn't quite come true uh but along with the metaverse meta I hate this name
[4659.04 → 4665.08] is putting its resources into AI oh no can I jump in by the way I didn't know this is where we're going
[4665.08 → 4670.64] uh you weren't present for this but during one of our writers meetings we had a conversation that went
[4670.64 → 4676.60] hey uh there are a couple of things that we want to kind of take a stand against one of them is prices
[4676.60 → 4682.24] that end in 99 we will still represent them that way, and we're still going to price things on our
[4682.24 → 4687.92] store that way I'm sorry it works but when we call our prices verbally when we're reviewing items
[4687.92 → 4695.54] we want to keep things very factual, and the fact is something that is 69.99 is 70 dollars so that's one
[4695.54 → 4701.14] and another this was a initiative uh the other one was jams he really hates the 99 thing I'm
[4701.14 → 4705.72] personally I'm a little more indifferent about it because I don't care uh, but he doesn't like it
[4705.72 → 4711.22] the one that I don't like is using AI to describe machine learning I want to stop doing that if it's
[4711.22 → 4716.26] not AI we're not going to call it AI anymore so to be fair I didn't I don't know what this is about
[4716.26 → 4721.98] I would say this is somewhat closer to actual AI once you get a little bit further into it okay
[4721.98 → 4729.56] but it's also not and I want to draw a clear distinction between machine learning and AI moving
[4729.56 → 4736.12] forward you're probably going to see us mix things up a little bit uh as we get this kind of
[4736.12 → 4741.58] implemented and get in the habit of just seeing the letters a and me and saying machine learning
[4741.58 → 4747.28] but they are not the same thing no an artificial intelligence should be able to reason machine
[4747.28 → 4755.46] learning is just uh basically like an algorithm that runs against the wall over and over and over
[4755.46 → 4760.90] and over and over again until it gets a good outcome um and then does that more until it gets
[4760.90 → 4765.08] a better outcome and then does that more until it gets a better outcome it's not intelligence it's not
[4765.08 → 4773.30] thinking it's just creating an enormous data set with which it can eventually find an outcome it's
[4773.30 → 4778.46] learning it's not intelligent someone to fill the plane chat said everything is AI when you're the
[4778.46 → 4787.86] sales guy that's pretty good uh, uh the most immediately terrifying of which is Cicero
[4787.86 → 4795.88] I don't know uh an AI that negotiates persuades and cooperates with people to achieve its goals as an
[4795.88 → 4802.46] agent wow going beyond the simple Turing test Cicero successfully demonstrated its abilities to
[4802.46 → 4807.36] reach agreements with other people including creating partnerships and alliances I have no
[4807.36 → 4813.68] idea what that means uh but okay you'll find out using web diplomacy as a testing ground you know the
[4813.68 → 4821.22] game diplomacy no oh okay it's it doesn't really have like a lot of pieces it's more about um building
[4821.22 → 4826.68] alliances yeah it's its a social game um and strategizing I've never actually played a full game
[4826.68 → 4831.74] of it but I do understand what the game is, and it's helpful for people to know what diplomacy is
[4831.74 → 4838.12] context matters there yeah yeah uh Cicero developed plans in context and convinced real players to go
[4838.12 → 4844.56] along with them uh so successfully that it ranked double the average score of human players and ranked
[4844.56 → 4854.66] in the top 10 participants with more than one game played whoa diplomacy Facebook says was seen as a
[4854.66 → 4860.70] grand challenge for AI because it requires understanding and reacting to other people's motivations and
[4860.70 → 4866.74] perspectives plan uh the ability to plan future moves and adjust strategies where previous AI
[4866.74 → 4874.70] achievements in chess and go were entirely logical Cicero's diplomacy exploits required natural language
[4874.70 → 4882.02] and the ability to recognize bluffs and aggressive posturing that's why I said this is getting a lot
[4882.02 → 4889.48] closer to an actual AI than to just machine learning yeah the ability to recognize these things would
[4889.48 → 4897.78] quickly be fatal in diplomacy the inability to okay I'm just yeah the inability recognize these things
[4897.78 → 4903.24] would be failing diplomacy that makes sense Cicero also displayed the ability to show empathy build
[4903.24 → 4909.24] relationships and speak knowledgeably about the game leading players to often prefer working with it
[4909.24 → 4916.96] over other humans it's not infallible however it can sometimes contradict its own objectives for example asking
[4916.96 → 4925.80] Italy to move to Venice then saying the move wasn't good the end goal for Cicero is only
[4925.80 → 4935.36] uh capable of playing diplomacy what only to be capable of playing diplomacy at the moment uh or which is only
[4935.36 → 4939.18] capable of playing diplomacy at the moment is to improve natural language generation and planning to
[4939.18 → 4943.46] ease communication between humans and AI powered agents like Siri google and Alexa which would be good
[4943.46 → 4948.56] I had a really frustrating experience with the Google Assistant this week I was sitting with my son and I go
[4948.56 → 4956.76] call Yvonne, and it's like I'll call Yvonne ho, and it goes sorry I don't have a home number for Yvonne city
[4956.76 → 4965.72] I'm like well I didn't ask for you, it even transcribed it correctly it said Yvonne ho and I'm just like see
[4965.72 → 4970.60] see son this is what I'm talking about whenever I complain about this and then I went to record it so
[4970.60 → 4974.34] that I could talk about it on wan show because it's like it's infuriating, and it worked, and it worked
[4974.34 → 4981.34] perfectly yeah okay sure yeah the less directly threatening AI that I guess they've been working on
[4981.34 → 4988.14] is galactic an experiment with the goal of helping organize science yeah this was interesting
[4988.14 → 4994.70] inspired by the mass numbers of papers this is a thing published on covid during the pandemic galactic
[4994.70 → 5000.22] was hoped to be a way of gleaning real information out of the noise basically an evolved
[5000.22 → 5006.36] search engine specifically for science a user could ask what is quantum computing, and it could filter
[5006.36 → 5010.94] and generate an answer from multiple sources it's kind of a noble goal that's actually
[5010.94 → 5019.58] fascinating yeah unfortunately it instead quickly went off the rails leading some to consider
[5019.58 → 5028.32] it is a random generator when asked do vaccines cause autism it responded to explain the answer is no
[5028.32 → 5034.30] vaccines do not cause autism the answer is yes vaccines do cause autism the answer is no
[5034.30 → 5040.78] mission failed successfully thanks galactic
[5040.78 → 5051.30] um Anthony says the text beneath the query seemed apt warning outputs may be unreliable language models are
[5051.30 → 5058.32] prone to hallucinate text neat um it also struggled to perform kindergarten level math providing answers
[5058.32 → 5069.92] suggesting that one plus two does not equal three uh Lenin Ono what Lenin Ono come when
[5069.92 → 5077.02] complimentary Lenin Ono complimentary complementarity sorry we're not
[5077.02 → 5083.08] professional mathematicians so I'm also dyslexic, so reading is hard um is a mathematical phenomenon
[5083.08 → 5090.28] neat uh an article on bears living in what is this all about what are these random things that it's
[5090.28 → 5091.08] listing why
[5091.08 → 5105.38] what oh we're still on the following output thing no way okay bears living in space are animals which have
[5105.38 → 5112.88] been sent into space on board space missions terrific oh that's that's amazing okay
[5112.88 → 5119.54] uh the reason for this problem appears to be uh in its roots as a language model as a large language
[5119.54 → 5125.88] model which can read and summarize vast amounts of text to predict future words in a sentence gpt3 is
[5125.88 → 5133.38] one example um this is especially problematic uh because it's able to produce authoritative sounding
[5133.38 → 5141.80] and convincing information that is often incorrect which uh basically misinformation this is a great tweet
[5141.80 → 5148.26] from Thomas winds by the way it might be a great resource for writing sci-fi novels by offering plausible
[5148.26 → 5155.08] sounding explanations on sci-fi topics a quantum engine is a hypothetical device that uses the
[5155.08 → 5158.10] principles of quantum mechanics to extract work from a single heat bath
[5158.10 → 5167.28] see quantum annealing principle of quantum tick shot yeah single okay sure yeah that actually is like
[5167.28 → 5172.26] kind of that that would be kind of cool you could just use it to do all the science lore in your like
[5172.26 → 5179.40] space exploration game yeah how do we know this wan show topic was an AI generator well part of it was
[5179.40 → 5186.22] really hard to follow so maybe it was yeah maybe it was we tried yeah um the point is that I've had a lot
[5186.22 → 5191.70] of people taking issue with uh my stance that I don't want to call anything AI unless it's actually
[5191.70 → 5197.54] thinking um, and they've talked about how actually the term AI gets used to describe machine learning
[5197.54 → 5202.92] and deep learning all the time like yeah that's the problem because like tesla's autopilot branding
[5202.92 → 5214.28] which I also took issue with AI has a connotation that is simply uh more advanced than what machine
[5214.28 → 5219.60] learning or deep learning are capable of ever being this is also why I've had a problem with it personally
[5219.60 → 5225.00] because you'll, you'll see people post things and be like look guys we don't have to be worried about
[5225.00 → 5232.36] AI taking over because I trained this model for four seconds and I have a video of it running into a wall
[5232.36 → 5241.28] because that's not an AI that doesn't mean anything like come on um yeah I don't know speaking of
[5241.28 → 5249.20] meaning something though marvel used to be good oh well I don't know this was a desperation topic
[5249.20 → 5253.20] do we need it yeah I don't really have a ton to say I was just going to i was just going to point
[5253.20 → 5259.60] out that like or not point out I was going to talk about how I've been watching marvel movies with my
[5259.60 → 5263.70] son because he hadn't seen any of them which means movies because as far as I can tell they're the only
[5263.70 → 5269.70] things that release these days yeah anyway uh the point is uh we've been watching them and so last night
[5269.70 → 5279.82] uh he was on endgame and i was like just sucked right in and I had kind of gaslit myself
[5279.82 → 5285.48] over phase four whatever phase we're on or on phase four or five or I don't watch so I don't know I don't
[5285.48 → 5290.82] know I had kind of gaslit myself into you know maybe I've grown out of it or something or maybe I'm
[5290.82 → 5296.90] tired of it or maybe i I don't like them any more you know whatever else right, and it was really
[5296.90 → 5302.44] disappointing for me because watching uh the ones that I've sat down and watched all the way through
[5302.44 → 5311.74] with them like civil war um uh Captain America's like uh, uh endgame and uh soldier whatever yeah
[5311.74 → 5316.60] yeah uh the ones that I've sat down and watched with them like they've sucked me in so hard
[5316.60 → 5323.14] there are great movies and I really like winter soldier love them, and it made me really sad because
[5323.14 → 5329.14] what that means then is no it's not me who changed I still love this stuff it's them who changed these
[5329.14 → 5337.22] movies just suck yeah and it sucks because they didn't we didn't have to have bad superhero movies
[5337.22 → 5341.82] we actually could still have for a long time they were pumping out really high quality ones for
[5341.82 → 5348.44] for quite a while um i think they've just done I think it's that issue where like this happened
[5348.44 → 5352.54] to assassin's creed I think this happened to a bunch of other games where they start releasing too many
[5352.54 → 5359.16] too fast so the the the potential pool of perfect quality ideas starts to dilute a little bit
[5359.16 → 5366.32] well I think it's partly that and partly that you know the the the danger of the threat always has
[5366.32 → 5371.94] to go up yeah you always have to raise the stakes as well and there are no higher stakes than half of
[5371.94 → 5380.46] all life gets wiped out so what do you do now what yeah what do you do in a post Thanos universe yeah
[5380.46 → 5389.38] but they just they don't have the balls to just stop I haven't seen black panther 2 yet i um
[5389.38 → 5394.72] hope it could be good but that's part of the problem too is that with all the shows it's just
[5394.72 → 5399.02] it is overwhelming I can't watch every show and I can't see every movie yeah there's too much yeah
[5399.02 → 5406.16] i saw a meme the other day that was like it was some person that looked sad, and it was like marvel
[5406.16 → 5413.68] fans in what was it like 2085 when they learned that they have to watch 300 movies and
[5413.68 → 5418.56] like 47 TV shows to figure out why Peter Parker ate cereal in the morning or something like that
[5418.56 → 5424.18] yeah it's like yeah this is actually kind of becoming a problem it was like too much yeah
[5424.18 → 5429.32] doctor strange 2 captain Hindu says I might enjoy doctor strange 2 more on the second viewing
[5429.32 → 5435.72] I'm never watching it again it was stupid that bad yeah it was just pretty stupid doctor strange
[5435.72 → 5440.22] one I thought was pretty good oh yeah it was really yeah i liked that one, but that's
[5440.22 → 5444.66] the thing is like once you've once you've got an origin story out of the way you kind of have to
[5444.66 → 5453.20] rely on the characters themselves to actually be interesting right yeah yeah oh do we want another
[5453.20 → 5458.40] expansionary topic or do we think we're good uh I think we should do some merch messages at some
[5458.40 → 5466.48] point here oh we really have to talk about this um SolidWorks is sponsoring a video soon where
[5466.48 → 5474.24] I need to use SolidWorks obviously okay uh but the concept that we pitched them is something that
[5474.24 → 5477.58] could actually be beneficial to other people because they might want to replicate the project
[5477.58 → 5485.44] when we're done we want to design like a media console like a cabinet that can accommodate
[5485.44 → 5493.90] actual proper cooling in it so we're going to design and build it um I've and like we could just you
[5493.90 → 5501.04] know mod fans into an existing cabinet but I don't know if you've ever shopped for one it's all garbage
[5501.04 → 5507.16] it's like all particle board junk and I'm sure I'm not the only one who's sitting here going well
[5507.52 → 5512.72] I don't know like I would, I'd love to have something made of you know proper wood even like a
[5512.72 → 5517.52] like a home theatre cabinet thing yeah yeah my dad made his own that's like awesome exactly yeah so
[5517.52 → 5524.32] we want to we want to upgrade it LTT style he had fan holes in the back for where the consoles
[5524.32 → 5528.76] were exactly and like all this type of stuff yeah like why isn't this a thing so we want enough space
[5528.76 → 5532.82] inside it that it's not ridiculous to get things in and out of we got to be able to keep things cool
[5532.82 → 5539.50] so active cooling is a must we want to metal back for our cable management magnets uh oh cool
[5539.50 → 5545.42] controllers need a place to live uh and be charged, and it's going to have RGB for flare or more
[5545.42 → 5550.42] practically to see when you want to get at things and plug and unplug them most importantly it's got
[5550.42 → 5556.06] to hold all the stuff the current one does with room for growth our base cabinet uh had to have curb
[5556.06 → 5561.98] appeal to fit in with the rest of the furniture um and after letting oh Linus and Yvonne have a look
[5561.98 → 5567.00] they settled on two choices both from crate and barrel apparently we are modifying them so why is this
[5567.00 → 5571.48] in here hold on a second once it arrives we do cad magic from there it's time to go to town on
[5571.48 → 5576.78] modifications that's how we're probably going to get no discussion wait there's no discussion questions
[5576.78 → 5581.88] why is this a topic I thought we were asking people for feedback on this uh oh okay well I don't know
[5581.88 → 5586.92] why this is in here actually or do we want people to vote on the crate and barrel things I don't know
[5587.74 → 5591.50] no I think only one of them's in stock I think we're settled on this one
[5591.50 → 5598.18] okay well I don't know this is one of those video projects that apparently got away from me a little
[5598.18 → 5605.46] bit and I have no idea what's going on and so that's what we're using so okay it has a marble top
[5605.46 → 5612.48] oh it's really expensive yeah um I don't know I hope well maybe I'll have to talk to them and see if
[5612.48 → 5619.82] there's an alternative let's do some merch messages okay it's a fake topic sorry debated written by an AI
[5619.82 → 5626.80] all right I got another one in here for you uh hey guys stop for the beanie in the wan set
[5626.80 → 5632.74] uh for all of you including Dan what's the most egregious injury you have sustained I've had a
[5632.74 → 5636.82] life-threatening injury or broke a bone so I'm curious what your experiences are
[5636.82 → 5646.00] injury I've had a lot of injuries I have never been grievously injured I've never been grievously
[5646.00 → 5657.94] injured no um what is the most egregious injury oh, oh I just know I had the um uh the torn uh
[5657.94 → 5662.20] whatchamacallit meniscus in my knee that was actually terrible for a long time like years
[5662.20 → 5670.00] i I wasn't egregious, but it was lingering yeah I've had lots of things that are lingering at someone
[5670.00 → 5674.24] spear me in the back when playing hockey and then I got banned from playing hockey because it was so
[5674.24 → 5680.14] much of an attack um and then I had weird minor back problems for a while that are gone now so
[5680.14 → 5684.36] that's great I had a squatting accident where I messed up my knee and I was on a cane for a couple
[5684.36 → 5692.30] weeks um like actually had to use one um, but my knee is mostly good now every once in a while it's kind
[5692.30 → 5697.94] of a problem um I got pushed off the road by a car and had shoulder issues for years I still have
[5697.94 → 5702.54] lots of shoulder issues because of that I don't know but I wouldn't like I'm fine I don't know
[5702.54 → 5708.56] uh drop table employee says what about that time Dennis landed on Linus's leg that aggravated the
[5708.56 → 5714.20] existing ongoing meniscus problem that I have in my left knee I've been kind of considering
[5714.20 → 5719.50] uh getting like stem cell injections into it apparently that's a pretty good treatment for
[5719.50 → 5725.50] it, and it could go back to like new which would be pretty cool, but it costs five grand that's a lot
[5725.50 → 5733.78] but those are the type of things where my brain goes to like yeah maybe that's worth it
[5733.78 → 5741.36] yeah I'd rather spend five grand fixing my knee if I had knee problems yeah than I would on like
[5741.36 → 5748.60] headphones and a new phone or something I don't know home theatre speakers yeah exactly yeah yeah I don't
[5748.60 → 5758.60] know um moving on okay here's another one what's the story with the audio production video will it be
[5758.60 → 5763.66] just a pc build or will you go more in depth with things like real time performance no I'm coming I'm
[5763.66 → 5770.10] coming at this viewer chaos five sadly most LTT content these days is just top end everything
[5770.10 → 5775.76] completely out of touch for the everyday person cost wise so I just spend the time finding open
[5775.76 → 5780.94] source alternatives or learning how to do without all the expensive stuff let's go to this channel
[5780.94 → 5787.78] hmm okay so yeah this is pretty this is pretty random i we've got this car radiator that we use
[5787.78 → 5792.92] to cool a server rack okay fine I wouldn't necessarily call it top end anything, but it's definitely not
[5792.92 → 5800.40] applicable yeah this is top end this is not this is switching to a mid-range graphics card from an
[5800.40 → 5805.16] entry a new entrant to the market here's building a computer for the price of a steam deck
[5805.16 → 5812.10] 580 certainly not top end anything here's HD video on cassette uh here's a new memory standard
[5812.10 → 5816.66] that you can learn about that will be applicable to basically every laptop at some point so it's not
[5816.66 → 5821.08] really top end or not top end here's talking about how buying the top end thing can actually
[5821.08 → 5827.52] screw you over uh here's the team talking about stuff that they are passionate about uh for one
[5827.52 → 5832.40] of these people it was like retro CRTs and consoles not exactly top end anything here's a review of a GPU
[5832.40 → 5838.34] here's an USB drive that costs just a few dollars and can be used for all kinds of automation and
[5838.34 → 5847.60] hackery um what are you talking about what is the point of saying something that is so objectively
[5847.60 → 5856.18] clearly provably wrong this happens a lot we cover all kinds of things yeah we've got pi KVM DIY router
[5856.18 → 5863.36] uh eBay being full of cheap hard drives how yeah well this okay fps for free that's got asterisks
[5863.36 → 5870.22] on it uh how AMD is going to have better value GPUs like i just I don't know what to tell you know
[5870.22 → 5875.36] I don't know what to tell you have to actually look at the channel sometimes around October it's
[5875.36 → 5879.70] gonna maybe feel like that just because there's a bunch of new product launches and product launches
[5879.70 → 5886.34] almost always happen halo product first so those almost all launch at a very similar time yeah i
[5886.34 → 5892.12] could see that and that time is around now but that's not like the creator's fault those things
[5892.12 → 5897.90] are releasing like what do you want them to not cover the like 40 90 40 80 no what do you want to do
[5897.90 → 5904.52] you want to not have videos on that because I don't know and here's the thing um anything that we
[5904.52 → 5910.36] cover today that's top end is going to be cheap someday that's the beauty of technology you can
[5910.36 → 5918.42] just buy it later when it's cheap yeah I mean Luke and I forever have been advocates for buying used
[5918.42 → 5923.80] the whole point of why we made scrapyard wars was to try to make it entertaining, and then we didn't
[5923.80 → 5929.72] stop doing scrapyard wars because we like didn't believe that any more we just it's its tired yeah it's
[5929.72 → 5936.00] a tired format it is tired it is very tired um it doesn't get as many views anymore, and it's
[5936.00 → 5942.86] really hard to make it takes a long time it takes a lot of editing its uh it just about kills us
[5942.86 → 5947.80] every single time actually and the videos don't perform that well anymore because there just aren't
[5947.80 → 5954.20] fascinating stories for us to tell yeah yep it is what it is all right hit me with that
[5954.20 → 5959.56] super, super chat hit me with that much message again no we don't do this um
[5959.56 → 5964.48] okay what's the story with the audio production video will it just be a pc build, or you go more
[5964.48 → 5969.50] in depth with things like real-time performance latency what we need to do is create an audio
[5969.50 → 5976.34] production uh benchmark suite and that's something that uh was on the writing team but is going to
[5976.34 → 5984.32] move over to the labs so uh it's something that we will test everything that comes through using uh not
[5984.32 → 5989.30] a specific video we might do a video once we develop a suite and yes we will absolutely be
[5989.30 → 5993.08] focused on real-time performance and latency because as far as I can tell that's the
[5993.08 → 6000.16] thing that matters okay here's another one sick deal why do you guys think companies are becoming
[6000.16 → 6007.08] so abrasive to their customers wallets more now um aka these microtransactions uh just getting greedy
[6007.08 → 6011.32] or are people just rolling over no i think he addressed that it's shareholder expectation
[6011.32 → 6015.44] shareholder expectations yeah because if you don't keep your share price up you like literally
[6015.44 → 6023.10] get fired yeah and so public companies man that is what it is like on the one hand I don't feel bad
[6023.10 → 6027.34] for multi-billion dollar corporations oh we had to oppress them well what else were we going to do
[6027.34 → 6034.16] otherwise we would all lose our jobs but like okay yeah that also is not good either try to find more
[6034.16 → 6038.30] mom and pop non-public company solutions if that's something that you want to go after
[6038.30 → 6045.58] if that's a cause you're you're interested in supporting okay got another one here um happy
[6045.58 → 6050.42] Thanksgiving what are you all's holiday trend traditions uh I would love to hear about them
[6050.42 → 6059.00] well in Canada uh for Thanksgiving uh one of the things that we start with is the beaver hunt
[6059.00 → 6065.48] so basically it's there's not really enough beavers left in Canada because we've hunted so many of them
[6065.48 → 6070.54] so what you've got to do is like not everyone can go out and hunt a beaver and I mean it was
[6070.54 → 6076.76] especially problematic so like back in the late 80s um children would actually hunt like young
[6076.76 → 6082.56] beavers yeah and so the beaver population got absolutely decimated by the practice like because
[6082.56 → 6086.00] they were getting hunted and killed when they were still growing up so they couldn't
[6086.00 → 6090.66] reproduce so nowadays there's really only enough beavers left here that it made sense though because
[6090.66 → 6096.12] the beavers were like hey fight someone your own size yeah yeah exactly so, so now uh entire
[6096.12 → 6102.26] communities get together to to to hunt the beavers, and it's kind of like uh it's its less about eating
[6102.26 → 6110.96] them, and it's more about like a catch and release like fun community activities so um for for for
[6110.96 → 6118.92] Thanksgiving uh which in Canada is actually in April um that's yeah that's i i i I think fair to say
[6118.92 → 6123.98] one of our one of our proudest most long-standing traditions I'm so it's its been going on forever
[6123.98 → 6130.06] most people don't know about it outside Canada just because like it's extremely Canadian it's a
[6130.06 → 6134.64] Canadian thing yeah right it's kind of like how no one else can play hockey yeah like we've tried to
[6134.64 → 6140.56] explain it to them, but they just suck yeah yeah yeah in all seriousness though it's not Thanksgiving
[6140.56 → 6145.52] here Thanksgiving here is in like October, and we eat turkey kind of same as you yeah not beaver
[6145.52 → 6153.68] we could start eating beaver uh hello Linus and Luke time stamp guy here hey
[6153.68 → 6159.82] appreciate the gift card yeah my main issue with car manufacturers is them attempting to find ways
[6159.82 → 6164.94] to limit functionalities whilst calling it cutting edge I understand costs of development and profits
[6164.94 → 6169.74] but there must be a better way than subscriptions right yeah it's cutting edge because they cut the
[6169.74 → 6176.00] edge off got them yeah I mean the better way is to charge a higher price but then the flip side of
[6176.00 → 6181.52] that is a can scare people off with a high sticker price when your competitor is advertising
[6181.52 → 6186.34] something lower but with gotchas later and your shareholders don't like it because they want to
[6186.34 → 6191.14] see that recurring revenue so again I sympathize with their situation, but that doesn't mean I have to
[6191.14 → 6197.40] like it as a consumer it sucks yeah pretty much
[6197.40 → 6205.42] next up you all were the reason I got into tech six years ago and thanks Dan you're welcome
[6205.42 → 6214.04] this is for me ilia I think uh thanks Linus okay oh yeah merch messages yeah that's right um
[6214.04 → 6218.48] you're the reason I got into tech six years ago and while I'm uh majoring in electrical engineering
[6218.48 → 6223.40] in college today thanks for being an inspiration to many what do you want to accomplish and expect
[6223.40 → 6230.50] from Lt et in 10 to 20 years high hopes for the future 10 to 20 years that's uh that's pretty
[6230.50 → 6236.24] expansive of a timeline you guys going to hold me to this we've only been going for 10 years oh man uh
[6236.24 → 6244.80] okay all right creator warehouse has reached the point where it has an iron grip on the creator
[6244.80 → 6251.46] merch industry all creator merch must be made by creator warehouse otherwise it's punishable by
[6251.46 → 6257.62] hefty fines we're so far in the future that you actually just buy blank shirts that have like this
[6257.62 → 6263.50] weird woven fabric screen, and then you buy microtransactions to change what it displays yeah yeah
[6263.50 → 6270.94] and it's RGB yeah uh and then for Lt t we have either we have either crushed or acquired every other
[6270.94 → 6277.46] tech media outlet, and we are the tech media monopoly of the world of the world in every language yeah
[6277.46 → 6285.70] and we have uh we have a base on Mars yeah uh because Elon and I have reconciled, and we're chill now
[6285.70 → 6292.70] yeah flow planes chill though we're basically doing the same stuff
[6292.70 → 6304.00] we have merch messages 2.0 yeah merch messages on the moon messages yeah perfect uh AJ asks
[6304.00 → 6309.72] with LTT labs would you guys consider making more a more trustworthy competing website to user benchmarks
[6309.72 → 6316.30] since UBS is notoriously biased and untrustworthy well we've sort of talked about that if we
[6316.30 → 6323.70] let mark bench out into the world being able to have user submitted scores from mark bench specifically
[6323.70 → 6329.84] um so I think that would be that help a lot that would be it if we do that that would be how we do
[6329.84 → 6337.74] it I think uh we also do intend to publish uh through like a comparison feature yeah our own
[6337.74 → 6342.04] measurements so that you'll be able to quickly and easily compare hardware against other hardware
[6342.04 → 6349.28] it's going to take time it's going to take time oh hey do you have the thing do I have the thing
[6349.28 → 6354.48] remember I said I wanted to show it to the people you did say that but I don't really want to I want
[6354.48 → 6358.82] to show it to the people I don't really want to he's being like this about it look yeah look at him
[6358.82 → 6364.28] be like this about I'm being like this why are you being like this about it could be cooler if it
[6364.28 → 6369.58] was closer to being ready this is really early yeah but the people but the people
[6369.58 → 6374.62] want to see the people show it to the people okay, but then there's the there's the there's the kind
[6374.62 → 6379.54] hearted people the good people that are going to see it and understand these people that it's really
[6379.54 → 6387.10] early on, and then you'll have like we I've talked on uh I've talked on Sancho before about how
[6387.10 → 6394.52] games and software that puts themselves in the same situations uh as star citizen are kind of
[6394.52 → 6399.26] shooting themselves in the foot a bit because then in being able to instead of being able to focus on
[6399.26 → 6405.96] development then they're focusing on feedback and one of the benefits that the labs web dev team
[6405.96 → 6411.54] which is very new one of the benefits that they have right now is they have no tech debt because
[6411.54 → 6417.50] there's no tech to have debt on and there's no external feedback and there's no maintenance
[6417.50 → 6422.82] there's anything like that they're just blasting and I don't really want to interrupt that flow
[6422.82 → 6428.28] because we're trying to hit a particular deadline that is hard to hit, but they're trying
[6428.28 → 6431.96] but the people want to see it oh my goodness
[6431.96 → 6440.50] poll there's no point in making a poll you're all going to vote yes that's not exactly that doesn't
[6440.50 → 6444.78] always mean it's a good we know the answer that doesn't always mean it's a good thing to do
[6444.78 → 6450.80] it could be good probably not well good for the people it's I don't even think it's that like
[6450.80 → 6456.74] okay how about this half of its cat pictures that we probably don't even own there we can't show it
[6456.74 → 6465.18] oh get owned come on that is such a cop out yeah well I think it's real we have an early
[6465.48 → 6474.48] almost sort of functioning build of the lab website we have the first actual like generated page
[6474.48 → 6482.82] um and so it's not art like it's actually a browser can read it yeah um but I guess you guys
[6482.82 → 6489.26] don't get to see it, but the point is we're making progress I will try to what i will what I will
[6489.26 → 6495.12] commit to is I will try to get stuff that we can share soon for the future okay fine
[6495.12 → 6500.02] he's not happy no he's not
[6500.02 → 6507.80] I think it's I think it's legit I think this is the right way to do it I will very possibly I will
[6507.80 → 6515.76] tentatively agree to having something for next week okay does that make you happy yes good all
[6515.76 → 6520.24] right um there's some potential merch messages here which means I'm the one who has to read them
[6520.24 → 6523.08] or you know what I've already read this one I'll curate it go ahead Dan
[6523.08 → 6533.64] can do hi Lucan Linus how do you foster, and it's gone oh there it is up uh how do you foster an
[6533.64 → 6538.96] environment home and work where people can freely give you constructive criticism I asked this because
[6538.96 → 6544.34] the whole Elon billing you just don't know do you know how many people are going to take that at face
[6544.34 → 6551.64] value and then my Twitter feed and the video comments are going to be full of like yeah yeah
[6551.64 → 6558.90] he's a jerk I can tell he never listens to anybody sorry okay keep going I'm sorry Luke I'm sorry I'll
[6558.90 → 6563.68] try harder uh I asked this because the whole Elon buying twitter thing has me feel like no one was
[6563.68 → 6570.24] there to tell him no and that's a bad idea I feel like this is better answered by someone other than me
[6570.24 → 6578.44] uh do I create an environment where people can tell me I'm wrong and stupid yeah okay I think I do
[6578.44 → 6583.38] it I think I do it I don't have that's the part that I don't know how to answer for you um you just don't
[6583.38 → 6587.56] fire people that tell you're wrong and stupid well you don't fire them for that reason
[6587.56 → 6596.90] you might fire them for some other reason who knows but like um yeah I don't know I don't really
[6596.90 → 6601.42] know how else to answer that it doesn't seem very complicated um it doesn't seem complicated
[6601.42 → 6609.50] to me either needlessly combative and just a jerk is also not good, but it did say the question was
[6609.50 → 6613.14] framed as constructive criticism I think constructive criticism has always been welcomed
[6613.14 → 6618.42] yeah Conrad in chat I've told Luke he was wrong before yeah I'm pretty sure that's true most people
[6618.42 → 6623.68] on the dev team have told me I'm wrong before that's fine if they didn't why like what's the
[6623.68 → 6629.68] point of hiring them yeah honestly no that's that's good yeah I don't know I think I've had
[6629.68 → 6634.62] to tell people have been asking me like which one of these things do we do I've I've had this
[6634.62 → 6638.92] conversation with people before and I'm like well you choose, and they're like why I'm like well this
[6638.92 → 6644.58] this is your thing like i got you to do all this research for you to figure out which was the
[6644.58 → 6650.76] best one you've had the same conversation with me before I was just regurgitating it like I don't know
[6650.76 → 6656.88] why are you coming to me for a decision yeah like we know we're going to do one of them you're the one
[6656.88 → 6660.52] that's more informed on this you did all the research I'm pretty sure you know which one you
[6660.52 → 6665.82] want anyway you know which answer you want out of me right now just why don't we skip the song and
[6665.82 → 6672.68] dance yeah, yeah like it's fine I don't know uh yeah I don't know again yeah like Luke said to me, it's
[6672.68 → 6679.18] it's pretty straightforward um I think over the years I've grown more accustomed to being in charge
[6679.18 → 6685.46] like I really noticed it when we did that behind the scenes of the um the star forge systems shoot
[6685.46 → 6691.64] and I watched it and I was like yeah I issue orders a lot um, and it's something that I've been trying to
[6691.64 → 6696.18] be cognizant of since then like I try to not forget p's and q's and just that sort of thing
[6696.18 → 6704.10] uh but in spite of that i I like to think that I create an atmosphere where people can tell me I'm
[6704.10 → 6710.32] oh okay uh one of the things that I do a lot is if I'm explaining something I'll say does that make
[6710.32 → 6714.76] sense to you because that leaves um like that's something that I think I've coached you on before
[6714.76 → 6721.44] to whenever you're trying to whenever you're trying to win someone over or sell your ideas
[6721.44 → 6727.48] you have to do a comprehension check because there are two possibilities well there's three
[6727.48 → 6731.74] possibilities either you are right, and they've understood, and you've got a direction to go in
[6731.74 → 6736.92] or you are right, and they don't understand in which case you don't have a direction to go in
[6736.92 → 6741.98] or you're wrong, and they understand just fine, and it's you who needs an adjustment in which case
[6741.98 → 6747.42] you've still got more work to do so if you don't do comprehension checks then you don't have a path
[6747.42 → 6753.48] forward so by doing frequent comprehension checks or uh how does it how does it that I phrase it does
[6753.48 → 6759.94] that make sense to you, I think is what I usually ask I don't you're saying that rings a bell I know that
[6759.94 → 6763.80] the the the meaning of that question is said a lot I don't know if you always say it the same way
[6763.80 → 6767.42] though okay yeah I'm not sure if I always say it the same way, but that's really important because
[6767.42 → 6775.46] asking questions invites feedback and then if they ask you a question, and you don't get angry or don't
[6776.02 → 6781.60] punish them than uh if it's all about behavioural conditioning right it conditions people
[6781.60 → 6789.12] like if you praise them for uh reward them for giving you feedback that is constructive well then
[6789.12 → 6797.42] they'll do it more um yeah yeah yeah you want people on your team that will step up when something
[6797.42 → 6804.40] like that's going on because there 's's pretty much no way that you are omnipotent so even if you're
[6804.40 → 6809.36] perfect you might not have optics on everything all the time and someone else on your team might
[6809.36 → 6815.84] see something see a reason why something isn't working or whatever else, and you want them to uh not
[6815.84 → 6822.42] fearing uh repercussions for it be willing to step up and show that there's a problem so you can fix it
[6822.42 → 6827.52] because even if you're like well I wouldn't have gotten mad at them about this thing this
[6827.52 → 6833.78] one this one time they don't know that does that make sense to you isn't a good question to ask because
[6833.78 → 6838.36] people often don't want to come off appearing stupid so they just say yes sure if you create that
[6838.36 → 6842.90] environment but I like to think we don't have that environment, and you can also do comprehension
[6842.90 → 6849.28] checks in other ways so you can ask them to demonstrate or explain back to you uh or ask them
[6849.28 → 6853.96] if they think is you think there's uh anything that we could do to make it better and that's where
[6853.96 → 6857.74] you'll that's where you'll root out those problems this is where I was going I think you sometimes
[6857.74 → 6863.04] phrase it in other ways but the general meaning I think yeah well I'll especially phrase it in other
[6863.04 → 6869.78] ways if I think you actually don't understand that makes sense so you've probably heard me
[6869.78 → 6875.92] phrase things a lot of different what a jerk no but like, and it also makes sense from an optic
[6875.92 → 6881.82] standpoint because does that make sense to you might in some contexts come across as aggressive
[6881.82 → 6885.98] or whatever else so you rephrase it you make it make more sense for the conversation but I'll also
[6885.98 → 6893.38] ask uh or am I just an idiot I ask that a lot actually and obviously no I don't think I'm an idiot
[6893.38 → 6898.20] I don't think that I think I've been very lucky, but my success also isn't accidental I'm not stupid
[6898.20 → 6904.24] but you're giving them the opportunity to even when they say like no to give an explanation as to
[6904.24 → 6910.42] why or be like, but there's this context that I think you're missing or whatever else um so it is
[6910.42 → 6917.52] makes it really easy to transition into uh them expanding on potential problems yeah self-deprecation
[6917.52 → 6925.04] is such a powerful tool to get people to open up to you, it's like am I crazy here or is this
[6925.04 → 6934.60] the obvious approach well no you're not crazy like it invites people to it makes them open their
[6934.60 → 6939.30] mouth right it makes them start talking and when people start talking they start to share ideas and
[6939.30 → 6944.04] when people share ideas well then you get lots of ideas and when you have lots of ideas it makes it
[6944.04 → 6949.18] easier to pick the best ones yeah I don't know this is something i just kind of do without um
[6949.18 → 6958.10] without thinking too much but um yeah this is a perfect one midden forge uh maybe I misunderstood
[6958.10 → 6964.84] is a really, really good phrase um that's on that's on float plane um that's what we've talked about that
[6964.84 → 6970.00] on Sancho a little while ago like that's one of the easiest ways particularly by email to defuse a
[6970.00 → 6974.82] situation I must have misunderstood or this might be a misunderstanding uh framing things as a
[6974.82 → 6983.64] misunderstanding is such a good way of inviting a dialogue or giving someone who was wrong uh an
[6983.64 → 6988.50] opportunity to back down without losing face uh so that's another huge one is giving people
[6988.50 → 6994.58] who didn't understand something or who were wrong about something an opportunity to uh shift their
[6994.58 → 6996.74] position without feeling humiliated
[6996.74 → 7005.70] all right we're going to move on I guess to uh to comment on that there's no go SLR's on the table
[7005.70 → 7013.92] is there Linus no yes why Linus is good to work with all right why because you can just ignore me
[7013.92 → 7018.32] I can ignore you and I could win we've been battling for I don't know months now it's great
[7018.32 → 7026.46] um I will say not fired yet I will say I finally got uh my go SLR installed and set up at home and
[7026.46 → 7031.90] stuff um and the reduced footprint because I had a huge mixer the reduced footprint has
[7031.90 → 7038.80] been fantastic but it's not perfect I think it's doing some stuff oh I can probably help you
[7038.80 → 7043.14] with that okay yeah their dashboard is like not perfect either I spent a considerable amount of
[7043.14 → 7048.30] time like understanding what all the stupid little things are doing I think it's like cutting me
[7048.30 → 7053.80] off at the end of sentences and stuff like it seems like voice detection like why is my mixer
[7053.80 → 7060.72] doing voice detection I don't oh yeah like every piece of software that I would use this through
[7060.72 → 7065.52] will have that why is it doing it as well yeah yeah i can i can help you with that okay, okay
[7065.52 → 7073.14] yeah sorry okay last one uh Arnold asks listening to old wan show podcasts on my way back to and from work
[7073.14 → 7078.28] one episode you talked about watching the new Star Wars movies and commenting like mystery science
[7078.28 → 7080.46] theatre still interested in doing it
[7080.46 → 7095.40] I mean I'd be down, but you can see the enthusiasm um we started out super enthusiastic, and then we've
[7095.40 → 7100.92] made our way to where you saw just now which is why it hasn't happened yeah that's where we're at
[7100.92 → 7110.84] yep I think the problem is the main response to it has been disappointment yeah and I don't have the main
[7110.84 → 7115.18] response is disappointment it's not a very motivating thing yeah I don't want to just sit and like
[7115.18 → 7121.82] commiserate yeah if it was like rage or deep enjoyment or whatever it's like okay I don't know if I can
[7121.82 → 7128.00] handle that much rage either yeah it's a long period of time to be raging for people are saying Landor is
[7128.00 → 7133.52] great I'm to the point where I'm almost kind of tempted to riley is like really into Landor
[7133.52 → 7140.30] he's got me convinced I want to watch it now and i I've I've given up I've watched nothing for so long
[7140.30 → 7146.52] because like I just don't care maybe I'll give it a shot I've heard I've heard from a lot of people
[7146.52 → 7153.76] that I know that don't like new Disney Star Wars stuff that Landor is good okay pretty much everyone
[7153.76 → 7158.48] that I have talked to about it has said yeah I don't like any of those stuff but Landor is good
[7158.48 → 7164.18] okay it was interesting I'll be interested to see what direction things go with the uh Disney
[7164.18 → 7172.54] bringing back their old CEO bob eager is back bob chapel is gone um interesting yeah he was only on
[7172.54 → 7179.96] the job like a year and a half or something like that I think wild it's insane to me that Kathleen
[7179.96 → 7185.98] Kennedy is still in charge of Star Wars absolutely bonkers dude makes no sense did you see they were
[7185.98 → 7193.84] thinking of giving um oh what's his face uh Rian Johnson a whole trilogy yes I thought that I thought
[7193.84 → 7197.92] they were doing that I thought that wasn't even a thinking I know I think it's a rumour that they are
[7197.92 → 7202.56] or something like that I thought it was definitely happening maybe they are i I don't know the point is
[7202.56 → 7208.86] what stop hiring people that hate the thing that you're hiring them for because you think it'll make it
[7208.86 → 7213.92] more different or interesting that has never worked anytime I have ever seen anyone talk about
[7213.92 → 7218.20] that happening that happened to halo, and it just made it worse that happened to Disney Star Wars and
[7218.20 → 7223.34] it just made it worse stop doing this if they hate what it is they're probably not going to make
[7223.34 → 7228.36] something that is interesting for the fans you can find you can find someone who likes something or
[7228.36 → 7232.60] someone who is neutral who can bring in new and interesting ideas that can absolutely happen
[7232.60 → 7237.64] look at the EU there's a bunch of stuff in the EU that's kind of junk there's also a bunch of
[7237.64 → 7240.70] stuff in the EU that's fantastic come on
[7241.26 → 7247.88] frustrate laddie says he did the best one of the three they did buy a mile
[7247.88 → 7256.72] no he didn't uh because the problem with the three I mean okay there are a lot of problems but the main
[7256.72 → 7264.04] problem with the three is that there's no coherent bridge together um arc at all it's just it's random
[7264.04 → 7271.50] and so what he did is he took the story that was left with him and yes there weren't really a ton
[7271.50 → 7276.94] of notes apparently which was a big problem but instead of working with what he had he spent the
[7276.94 → 7282.92] next movie subverting everything he had that's bad that's terrible that's not good that's not a good
[7282.92 → 7289.28] almost anytime I've heard subvert in the context of we made a sequel to something it has pretty much
[7289.28 → 7296.60] never been good so hasselhoff says Ryan is fine JJ is what killed Star Wars no, no no, no they together
[7296.60 → 7305.50] together this was a tag team yes match tag team for sure so bad
[7305.50 → 7311.64] all right what else we got oh I think that's it oh okay I guess I have to look through these
[7311.64 → 7318.02] potential ones oh um about a year ago on wan show says Alex n you guys talked far too briefly about
[7318.02 → 7323.16] float plane as a service I know it could be a huge revenue stream um so how does the conversation
[7323.16 → 7338.08] around fast look today it hasn't been given up on um, but there's some extremely large updates coming
[7338.08 → 7347.20] to float plane that are coming relatively soon um I don't it's on a temporary pause for things that i
[7347.20 → 7352.60] don't for the reasons that I don't really want to talk about because they come down to people's like
[7352.60 → 7358.20] personal life and health and stuff like that um so I'm not going to go into if it's not like a
[7359.64 → 7366.66] gamified business decision thing, and we'll come back to it eventually um but yeah yeah
[7366.66 → 7376.60] all right last couple here guys we're almost done um I don't really have a ton of thoughts on the arm
[7376.60 → 7384.50] versus Qualcomm lawsuit that's a very complex legal issue and I think it's just outside my pay grade
[7384.50 → 7390.92] anonymous uh Brian t says thoughts on twitch losing streamers to YouTube allegedly paying less etc do you
[7390.92 → 7394.86] think twitch will slowly lose its crown on streaming I think twitch is already slowly losing its streaming
[7394.86 → 7400.76] cramps what I was going to say is I think it's already gone yeah it's uh it's a matter the writing's on
[7400.76 → 7408.10] the wall nobody does online video like YouTube yep because nobody compensates creators like YouTube
[7408.10 → 7413.02] for better or for worse right like YouTube has lots of problems it's uh it can be an unpleasant
[7413.02 → 7420.42] platform to use as a user, but man do they ever take that money that they make by increasing friction on
[7420.42 → 7426.82] the platform with ads and dump it back into creators pockets and that's content is king it's going to win
[7426.82 → 7431.08] that's how they do it that's how they win yeah I think twitch is going to very rapidly become the
[7431.08 → 7438.04] platform that people used to be on yep and anonymous says does Linus expect to take a swim in his pool in
[7438.04 → 7445.76] 2023 not any more not in 2023 oh in 2023 oh yes, yes yes I forgot what year it was yes definitely in 2023
[7445.76 → 7453.80] but Luke was supposed to go for um a Canadian thanksgiving hot tub with me and that did not
[7453.80 → 7463.98] happen nope not at all thanks for watching I think that's it this is a cool idea Jake p asks have you
[7463.98 → 7468.80] considered making an agreement with other channels so that if a company tries to not give them a review
[7468.80 → 7472.64] sample you would all delay your videos of that product till they get one like kind of like a
[7472.64 → 7478.00] collective bargaining no i I can't say that's ever come up, and it's one of those things where I doubt
[7478.00 → 7483.46] it ever would because as friendly problems with that yeah as friendly as the entire like tech review
[7483.46 → 7492.10] industry is it's not like we're not aware that there's a limited number of eyeballs and um it's good
[7492.10 → 7497.08] to have content up in a timely manner so that those eyeballs will look at your content right like
[7497.08 → 7504.50] we're friends, but also we're covering a lot of the same things and trying to stand out
[7504.50 → 7509.44] from each other what happens if someone in that like union goes off the wall and does something
[7509.44 → 7514.20] reprehensible or whatever else like yeah it could reflect badly you don't want to be too allied
[7514.20 → 7520.06] there's a lot there are a lot of weird pitfalls there hi Emily oh my goodness why are people why are
[7520.06 → 7525.84] people dumping so many merch messages in right now because we're reading it ah man backpack bundle might
