[0.00 --> 8.52]  What is up ladies and gentlemen welcome to the WAN show we've got a fantastic show for you guys lined up today
[8.52 --> 16.08]  Gamers Nexus has been making big news this week calling out Newegg's scammy return policies
[16.08 --> 25.44]  so we're gonna be definitely weighing in on that in other news Sony acquires Bungie for 3.6 billion
[25.44 --> 40.08]  Facebook loses 252 billion well yeah and valuation magic money and
[40.08 --> 47.64]  yeah you stole my other topic so I'm looking for another one oh yeah I think you mean I privateered
[47.64 --> 55.88]  topic you pirated my topic also New York Times uh purchased Wordle because everyone has to buy
[55.88 --> 64.70]  every game every company has to buy a game we should buy a game um okay PewDiePie here's my offer
[64.70 --> 72.18]  okay YouTuber simulator we want it dude I'm offering you two ABCs of gaming plushies from
[72.18 --> 80.94]  lttstore.com and this lock of my hair okay if you accept the offer if you accept the offer PewDiePie
[80.94 --> 87.66]  right now live on stream I will go get scissors I will chop off this lock of hair okay and I will
[87.66 --> 92.28]  mail it to you I want YouTuber simulator this is how business let's roll that intro
[102.18 --> 120.96]  the show is brought to you today by grid studio graphics and Squarespace all right let's jump right
[120.96 --> 129.24]  into our first topic this has been quite the saga according to gamers nexus Newegg has been running what
[129.24 --> 138.96]  amounts to a scam yeah so what exactly is is it and I am expecting to be able to contribute at least a
[138.96 --> 144.18]  little bit of my experience actually having worked on the retail side of things but let's go on and
[144.18 --> 151.04]  let's kind of let's kind of walk through what what happened here according to uh gamers nexus the
[151.04 --> 158.88]  problem is that customers are being denied refunds for ineligible products specifically motherboards
[158.88 --> 165.92]  the problem with this is that the motherboards are often new in box Jake just showed up Jake what
[165.92 --> 175.36]  can I do for you I can yeah I think I can show it sure I'm pretty sure it's fine I'm pretty sure I'm
[175.36 --> 186.48]  allowed to show wait are we allowed to show it not on uh I think so right okay yeah yeah yeah okay
[186.48 --> 193.80]  I think so do not turn it on I won't turn it on I won't turn it on have you held it yet no okay we're
[193.80 --> 198.00]  gonna talk about you're not allowed to talk about it we're gonna talk I know I he can talk about whatever
[198.00 --> 204.96]  he wants he doesn't know anything I know nothing oh yeah you can't talk about the feel or anything
[204.96 --> 212.52]  all we're allowed to tease no expression all we're allowed to tease is that we've got one
[212.52 --> 216.28]  so don't react to it in any way
[216.28 --> 229.24]  laughing is not a unique reaction for me everyone knows this oh I'm so excited not being able to say
[229.24 --> 235.96]  anything feels so like functionally wrong I know I know I know I know I know the problem though is
[235.96 --> 241.12]  that this is a final unit so while I have actually commented on things like ergonomics and we've even
[241.12 --> 247.60]  pointed a thermal camera at it when we did our early hands-on sneak peek that was on pre-production
[247.60 --> 252.76]  hardware this is the actual one that will be delivered to actual consumers have you placed a
[252.76 --> 258.28]  pre-order yet yeah yeah okay all right remember I told you you were like not stoked but I did it
[258.28 --> 263.86]  during WAN show right yes I want to get early in like you right yeah that's uh that that's fair
[263.86 --> 269.62]  that's fair I would love to ask you if you have any regrets but I can't because you can't I have things
[269.62 --> 275.42]  to say but I can't I have things to say he says all right well uh there will definitely there will
[275.42 --> 281.62]  definitely be opportunities to say things I've got a lot of content planned for the steam deck
[281.62 --> 289.32]  when uh are you allowed to say when you can say things no I that I'll usually when the NDA is
[289.32 --> 297.04]  expired is covered by the NDA right um one of the things that I am planning to do and I'm actually
[297.04 --> 303.58]  really excited about this one is I am going to switch to the steam deck as my only computer for a
[303.58 --> 310.66]  month whoa why not I mean you literally just did the Linux challenge so I think you can answer that
[310.66 --> 318.12]  question why not because of the problems but it's the steam deck theoretically theoretically and this
[318.12 --> 323.42]  is something I haven't tested I haven't I haven't touched yet because people in the chat are telling
[323.42 --> 332.36]  me to run to run no I mean I would do it yeah so like why not it's a quad core zen 2 processor
[332.36 --> 339.04]  right rdna2 graphics these are all things that are that are publicly known it's got up to a 512 gig
[339.04 --> 345.12]  sst what about it usb type c so you can plug into an external dock no I think it's a great idea what
[345.12 --> 351.42]  about it is not daily driver capable I think it's a great idea so I'm I'm gonna do it I'm gonna run it
[351.42 --> 358.10]  for a month and I'm going to report on my findings because valve has already got games on their
[358.10 --> 365.60]  validated list that I had trouble with when I was left to my own devices so if valve says hey it's
[365.60 --> 373.70]  gonna do it I you probably I'm excited on this but they they said the entire steam library they said that
[373.70 --> 381.96]  very early on and I pressed x to doubt and right now what I can say is that steam's validated game
[381.96 --> 387.98]  or valve's validated game list is not the entire steam library far from and that doesn't surprise me
[387.98 --> 394.52]  at all no that's what I can say right now okay yep yeah I mean good you remember me calling bs on
[394.52 --> 399.54]  that right out of the gate right yeah so that's that's actually insane like oh yeah it's impossible
[399.54 --> 404.12]  there's there's unless and I know they're working on it and they've actually made huge grounds and
[404.12 --> 407.84]  there's still that website you can look at it it has been getting slightly better etc etc etc but
[407.84 --> 414.48]  the anti-cheat problem is like a thing and that's just I don't know they'd have to convince a lot of
[414.48 --> 420.46]  old games to do updates to be compatible with this which is a very hard thing to convince developers
[420.46 --> 426.34]  to do yes that's fair let me go back to this old game that we haven't made any money from in a long
[426.34 --> 433.96]  time and like spend dev time on it that seems like good business all right speaking of good business
[433.96 --> 441.90]  apparently consumers who buy motherboards on new egg are being denied refunds for what are claims to be
[441.90 --> 447.52]  ineligible products except that this doesn't make any sense because apparently the motherboards are
[447.52 --> 456.26]  often new in box so new egg makes the claim that the cpu sockets have customer caused damage to the
[456.26 --> 462.44]  cpu pins and they're saying that that's their reason for withholding funds from people seeking
[462.44 --> 469.44]  an rma gamers nexus stumbled into this situation by returning a 500 motherboard that was purchased but
[469.44 --> 475.82]  no longer required which they actually mentioned in their refund request new egg responded that customer
[475.82 --> 485.88]  caused damage had been done to the cpu pins and denied gamers nexus's rma i gotta say when we've done
[485.88 --> 492.20]  things like secret shopper in the past we've actually jumped through a lot of hoops even going as far as
[492.20 --> 500.92]  to use the credit cards of relatives of employees when placing orders to ensure that no one catches that it's us
[502.12 --> 513.00]  and apparently you didn't even need to gamers nexus can just contact customer support for new egg get some rube who has no idea who they are
[513.00 --> 523.64]  who denies them an rma for some bs reason because and we know that this is bs gamers nexus never opened the motherboard
[523.64 --> 533.40]  it was a brand new inbox motherboard now for the uninitiated lga sockets are very fragile they have these
[533.40 --> 540.44]  little tiny pins in them have you ever bent them uh yeah yeah me too uh they are extremely easy to
[540.44 --> 546.44]  accidentally bend and once you bend them you're i mean here i can bleep you let's try and time it ready
[547.00 --> 552.44]  once once once you bend them you're i hope we got it
[554.20 --> 560.28]  pretty much we tried you can sometimes perform delicate surgery pick them up sometimes if you just
[560.28 --> 564.20]  squish them down you can lift them back up again yeah but it's a little sketchy and everyone's a
[564.20 --> 569.80]  little spooked about that socket from there from there on yeah oh absolutely yeah you're always
[569.80 --> 574.92]  concerned you never want to swap that cpo once you get it working and typically a brand new board comes
[574.92 --> 581.16]  with a hard plastic shield over those delicate pins to protect them during shipping but in spite of this
[581.16 --> 588.28]  many retailers actually require a visual inspection of the socket at the point of sale just as a way of
[588.28 --> 594.76]  covering their own butts because and i can tell you this from experience how often it happens that
[594.76 --> 602.20]  customers claim they didn't touch it or claim that it was unopened when actually they did touch it and
[602.20 --> 607.72]  actually it was not unopened and people are going to do that for sure is a lot more than you'd think
[607.72 --> 615.32]  because i think for a lot of people the rationalization is as simple as i simply cannot afford another
[615.32 --> 620.68]  motherboard and a lot of people cannot that's that's just reality this was literally everything
[620.68 --> 629.08]  i had i i need to do something um i feel like this wasn't my fault the the universe conspired against
[629.08 --> 637.32]  people like whatever whatever hoops they jump over to piracy to rational to rationalize it he's not gonna
[637.32 --> 643.32]  let this go i'm trying to move on today i told him before the show started i was like look we're not
[643.32 --> 651.56]  gonna have i'm not gonna have any hot takes today i'm keeping it ice cold like like in an ltd water bottle
[651.56 --> 664.04]  like in this lttstore.com no hot takes today he keeps he keeps drawing me back in so it is extremely common um
[664.04 --> 674.04]  for customers to do that oh okay sorry okay point of clarification uh gamers nexus's motherboard was brand new to him
[674.04 --> 680.04]  but it was open box okay so they did actually buy a refurbished motherboard in the first place but they had not
[680.04 --> 686.04]  opened it yeah it shouldn't matter yeah which doesn't which doesn't matter for the purposes of our conversation here
[686.04 --> 693.64]  for gamers nexus they had never touched the motherboard they never even opened the box yes it was opened at some point
[693.64 --> 699.24]  so anyway coming back to the coming back to customers claiming that they didn't touch stuff
[699.24 --> 707.56]  the amount of times that we have seen obvious physical damage in the form of everything from
[707.56 --> 714.76]  shorts that no we're not from a capacitor being soldered on backwards like amd's amd like asus's recent fiasco
[714.76 --> 722.36]  uh or like water damage right like really bad stuff is a lot more than you'd think and i think
[722.36 --> 728.68]  that most people out there most people most of you in the chat are probably by and large imagining that
[728.68 --> 734.68]  people who would try to pull that kind of scam are few and far between but from my experience it's
[734.68 --> 741.48]  absolutely not true it's not true there's a lot of people out there like i'd worked in retail and had
[741.48 --> 746.36]  people try and pull them pull one over on me all the time but because i'm pretty sad actually is that
[746.36 --> 752.44]  potentially an exposure problem because like i remember when when i worked at geek squad um i used
[752.44 --> 758.60]  to think and i mean they weren't exactly doing great but i used to think uh that hp laptops were just the
[758.60 --> 764.12]  worst thing ever because it was like the only thing that we would ever get coming in with problems was
[764.12 --> 770.20]  hp laptops and then i was talking to one of my mentors in geek squad uh and he was like well have you
[770.20 --> 775.24]  looked at like the sales numbers that were pushing through the store for laptops like well no and
[775.24 --> 779.00]  then you pointed out that it's like 80 something percent hp laptops at that time so he's like what
[779.00 --> 784.68]  do you think is going to come back it's like okay they weren't great obviously yep but it still was
[784.68 --> 790.36]  skewed by that whole stuff do you think it's potentially an exposure problem you were noticing
[790.36 --> 797.56]  these issues largely like what percentage of rma things do you think were actual user problems that
[797.56 --> 804.12]  they were covering up oh absolutely most of them were legitimate problems but what i'm trying to say
[804.12 --> 811.88]  is that if you see a hundred threads on reddit of people claiming that something like that something
[811.88 --> 819.08]  was physically damaged out of a out of a new box a not insignificant percentage of them are lying
[819.08 --> 823.64]  i mean you see you see a lot of that kind of stuff across the board divided says your experience is also
[823.64 --> 830.20]  outdated you're right in the last 12 years people have gotten so much better and more honest that's
[830.20 --> 834.44]  absolutely a thing that happened we've definitely seen that globally we've seen a really positive trend
[834.44 --> 839.64]  yeah um yeah i mean you see this across the board right you see this with cheaters video games you see
[839.64 --> 847.48]  this with with everything so okay who knows now now let's talk about the other possibility here okay
[847.48 --> 853.80]  because gamers nexus purchased an open box motherboard it is entirely possible that it was
[853.80 --> 860.68]  actually a missed bent pin or missed socket damage from the previous customer you know what else is
[860.68 --> 868.28]  possible it's possible that this particular motherboard there could have been nothing wrong with it at all
[868.28 --> 874.04]  we haven't actually gotten word from new egg about that particular possibility and i've actually got
[874.04 --> 878.20]  an additional possibility for you there's a lot of people in chat that are like so linus says blame
[878.20 --> 885.40]  the customer no that's not what i said i said that it's absolutely a possibility so don't take on what
[885.40 --> 891.80]  i'm saying is don't take one side automatically at all because there are a lot of different possible
[891.80 --> 900.12]  outcomes now for the motherboard itself the odds that the retailer damaged the socket are extremely low
[900.12 --> 908.12]  yeah like like minuscule low because even at ncix where we did put our own label on motherboards up
[908.12 --> 914.60]  until like 2007 or something like that even though they obviously have serial numbers i was like why
[914.60 --> 918.92]  are we doing this why do we put our own serial number on every product um they were like because
[918.92 --> 924.60]  that's the way we've always done it i'm like okay sure i guess so uh 2006 2008 i don't remember but
[924.60 --> 929.64]  some sometime around there they actually put their own labels on everything um i remember that so even
[929.64 --> 934.28]  though ncix did that they would act they actually had a way of doing it that they wouldn't even
[934.28 --> 940.68]  open up the tape over the the esd bag on the motherboard they would slit the bag slide in using
[940.68 --> 945.48]  a knife slide in the thing press it down and pull the knife out and apply it that way so there there is
[945.48 --> 951.16]  no reason for a retailer to open up the box of a product other than the one that they might open to
[951.16 --> 957.40]  take pictures and you'd notice if the socket was bent um in fact even that one would just be sold as open
[957.40 --> 966.28]  box uh probably but that's another that's another thing okay motherboards don't come shrink wrapped
[969.32 --> 973.56]  okay because i something i've been thinking of this whole time is wouldn't they wouldn't
[973.56 --> 978.36]  they said they didn't open it wouldn't it just be shrink wrapped but yeah no so that's something that
[978.36 --> 984.52]  i have wondered about for many years really this is a 500 board though a lot of high-end boards don't
[984.52 --> 990.52]  they have a sticker over the not necessarily motherboard manufacturers for whatever reason
[990.52 --> 997.16]  and i've never i've never actually asked but i've always been curious good i'm not against that but
[997.16 --> 1004.84]  motherboard manufacturers do not generally shrink wrap even their very high-end products and it seems
[1004.84 --> 1014.84]  to me that if they really wanted to put this to rest forever sealing the product would probably be a
[1014.84 --> 1023.32]  pretty good way to do it yeah but here's the issue i have seen bent pins and sockets uh geomaster
[1023.32 --> 1027.96]  yeah three seven on flow plane chat said but gamers nexus didn't open the box it was shipped in
[1027.96 --> 1033.80]  okay that's a whole separate conversation that's okay we're not even we're not even talking about
[1033.80 --> 1039.56]  the gamers nexus uh scenario in particular i'm talking about in general because here's the problem
[1040.20 --> 1048.60]  i have had this experience i have had the experience of opening up a brand new board and because i'm me
[1048.60 --> 1056.12]  it didn't even go to a retailer it came straight from the manufacturer and i was the first person to open
[1056.12 --> 1069.24]  it and i've seen bent pins so what i'm saying right now is that let's take every account of this
[1069.24 --> 1076.68]  happening with a grain of salt understanding that there are multiple possibilities here a possibility
[1077.32 --> 1084.20]  is that the customer is lying another possibility is that because motherboards do not come in sealed
[1084.20 --> 1091.48]  packages the retailer could easily be let's say for example throwing together a quick test bench
[1092.04 --> 1099.48]  yeah in order to something putting it really nicely back into the box and selling it as new that's a
[1099.48 --> 1107.08]  possibility possibility number three it could have just actually been bent straight from the factory so
[1107.08 --> 1113.80]  there are there are three possible avenues for actual damage to the cpu socket yeah now in the case of
[1113.80 --> 1120.76]  steves what i suspect is most likely because this was an open box board in the first place is that
[1120.76 --> 1126.12]  whoever are made it in the first place validation was poor whether that damage came from the factory
[1126.12 --> 1133.00]  or whether they caused it they managed to get one in under the radar whoever was the tech at newegg
[1133.00 --> 1138.44]  who inspected it or maybe didn't even bother i don't know whoever was the tech who inspected it didn't
[1138.44 --> 1143.56]  catch the bent pin it can be a little bit tricky to see them sometimes you can get it just right yeah and it
[1143.56 --> 1149.32]  ended up back on the shelf and it was sent to steve now because steve didn't actually open the box
[1151.24 --> 1157.56]  he actually wouldn't know if there was any thermal compound on the socket or if it had any bent pins
[1157.56 --> 1163.64]  or if there was any other kind of physical damage to it because he never looked at it and then newegg
[1163.64 --> 1169.96]  is basically going well it's impossible that there was anything wrong with it before we sent it
[1169.96 --> 1177.88]  which by the way as i already outlined for you guys is not impossible doing a typical computer
[1177.88 --> 1185.64]  retailer thing which is going not my problem and pushing it back to the customer do i think that
[1185.64 --> 1194.52]  new egg is actually running some kind of concerted scam where they are trying to take people's rma
[1194.52 --> 1204.92]  motherboards back and keep their money i sincerely doubt it um i feel like that's the kind of thing that
[1204.92 --> 1210.44]  would be whistleblown at some point i think they could be pushing those people to be abnormally strict
[1210.44 --> 1218.20]  though i think so not like a concerted scam of like hey hey uh rma specialist people just just
[1218.20 --> 1223.72]  refuse all of them tell them all they have socket damage but like maybe weighing really heavily on
[1223.72 --> 1228.68]  employee reviews or something on like oh you accepted too many motherboards with with sketchy
[1228.68 --> 1233.64]  pins and being really really really hard on them well the right amount of motherboards to accept with
[1233.64 --> 1239.40]  sketchy pins from from a new egg point of view where apparently you're making the assumption that it can't
[1239.40 --> 1247.24]  happen um would be zero yeah and here's another problem is that the retailer is often the first
[1247.24 --> 1252.68]  line of defense against the customer when a lot of the time it's actually not their policy so here's
[1252.68 --> 1259.56]  something that you guys might not realize is that asus gigabyte and msi they also as rock for that
[1259.56 --> 1265.40]  matter they also live in a magical fantasy land where it is entirely possible impossible for a motherboard
[1265.40 --> 1271.72]  to leave their factory with bent pins in it so if you try to rma as a retailer if you try to rma a
[1271.72 --> 1276.44]  motherboard with socket damage they will refuse it and you will be out the entire value of that motherboard
[1277.16 --> 1288.20]  so the question now to ask is okay who's where should this burden lie should it lie with new egg knowing
[1288.20 --> 1295.48]  that and i know this for a fact people damage things and lie about it should it lie with new egg should
[1295.48 --> 1301.24]  it lie with the manufacturer should it lie with the consumer the honest answers to all three of those
[1301.24 --> 1310.52]  questions are no yeah because there is so much uncertainty who should have to eat it every single time
[1310.52 --> 1318.28]  because i can tell you guys the the retailer does not make the kind of margin that you might imagine
[1318.28 --> 1328.44]  that they do i know i know a lot of motherboards get individually validated i don't know if that's
[1328.44 --> 1334.44]  true about everything 500 board might part of individual validation is potentially screwing it up
[1334.44 --> 1340.52]  yeah but i wonder i wonder how expensive documenting that validation would be
[1343.16 --> 1348.84]  because if you could have like photo evidence of your socket as it's leaving and you can and if
[1348.84 --> 1352.68]  someone's like oh this was screwed up at the manufacturer and they can be like nope picture
[1354.36 --> 1361.40]  that would that would kind of exclude one of those and then if i think especially for open box products
[1361.40 --> 1368.92]  if new egg would would would document the status of the product as it's being repackaged that would
[1368.92 --> 1376.20]  probably help their stance as well so the problem is that new eggs whole situation with gamers nexus was
[1376.20 --> 1382.36]  a comedy of errors so it's a lot more than just this debate over pins which i did want to talk about
[1382.36 --> 1387.80]  because there's a lot of there there are sides of it that i feel like people might not have considered
[1387.80 --> 1395.08]  yeah the issue though is that he never opened the board new egg claimed there was thermal compound in
[1395.08 --> 1402.12]  the socket despite the motherboard never having been opened by him and making problems even worse they
[1402.12 --> 1407.08]  actually asked to have the board sent back to them new egg claimed they sent it back and then so far
[1407.08 --> 1417.64]  to my knowledge has not actually provided a tracking number so making this even more complicated
[1417.64 --> 1422.04]  since the release of their video exposing the situation gamers nexus has apparently been flooded
[1422.04 --> 1426.84]  with similar accounts from viewers who have tried to return their gear and a number of their followers
[1426.84 --> 1435.16]  are now pledging to boycott new egg um lewis rossman has apparently weighed in asking what even
[1435.16 --> 1439.80]  happened to new egg who actually used to be known for their good service apparently i'm not american so
[1439.80 --> 1444.92]  i never really shopped there because by the time they opened up in canada i was working at a competitor so
[1444.92 --> 1449.56]  i wasn't gonna like shop there yeah i would just walk into the warehouse and buy something if i really
[1449.56 --> 1455.08]  needed to um but the response seems to be that they were purchased by liaison interactive a chinese
[1455.08 --> 1467.08]  tech company in 2016. all right who do you boycott them with i mean man there used to be there used to be
[1467.08 --> 1474.04]  so many more options man fries there used to be uh tiger direct there used to be zip zoom fly
[1474.76 --> 1481.32]  uh it's m wave m wave still around i feel like that's been a hot minute uh you've got micro center
[1482.60 --> 1487.64]  so micro center still exists oh yeah they're not in canada right yeah oh not in canada no but in
[1487.64 --> 1493.80]  i'm we're talking americans yeah uh tiger direct lmao yeah yeah a lot of people are talking about
[1493.80 --> 1499.56]  micro center in the twitch chat uh in the flip plane chat i did a sponsored event where i'm not
[1499.56 --> 1506.12]  going to say who but a company flew me out to go do a thing uh and we were building computers and the
[1506.84 --> 1512.28]  parts showed up late and we were unboxing all the parts or not unboxing but taking all the parts out
[1512.28 --> 1519.16]  and then we realized that there was a component missing yeah um and we had to go to a micro center
[1519.16 --> 1526.44]  to go pick up said component yeah it's a cool place yeah there's a really really big store like i i
[1526.44 --> 1533.72]  and i know that's like just some canadian dude in in america going like whoa but it was huge it was
[1533.72 --> 1538.28]  crazy and i heard that fries electronics was significantly bigger which is which is cool i'm
[1538.28 --> 1545.40]  used to like the i mean going to ncx when i was growing up it's this little like tiny little sliver hole in
[1545.40 --> 1549.88]  the wall yeah you basically go up to an order desk and just get your stuff like there's there's
[1549.88 --> 1556.28]  extremely limited browsing if basically any like the langley location had like two shelf things
[1556.84 --> 1562.12]  and i was like it then it was usually filled with just like cases that i assumed they couldn't fit in
[1562.12 --> 1567.40]  the back because it covered most of the floor um so yeah it was a i don't know it's kind of a cool
[1567.40 --> 1572.12]  experience man honestly this just makes me feel like ltt stores should just be a computer store
[1572.12 --> 1579.24]  like seriously the margins are just so thin though you know what so here's a crazy concept
[1579.96 --> 1585.80]  what if we just what if our margins just weren't that thin what if we just took an extra two percent
[1585.80 --> 1594.20]  and then just had not customer service like there's a novel idea but i i don't know i don't i don't know
[1594.20 --> 1602.92]  i mean you look at how price driven it purchasers are right like in what other space does a site like
[1602.92 --> 1611.32]  pc part picker even exist in the makeup space is there a pc part picker is there a facepaint picker.com
[1611.88 --> 1616.28]  right where you could you can make that you can actually actually probably be good money in that
[1616.28 --> 1623.80]  your lip eye uh facial compound whatever you like you you put in your whole regimen and it tells you
[1623.80 --> 1629.24]  the cheapest site to go buy it like honestly i don't think there is i don't think there is airline
[1629.24 --> 1636.52]  tickets okay that that's a good one probably actually navs a big big money idea yeah is is like
[1637.32 --> 1645.08]  a face painting thing where once you were done like creating your person yeah there would be like if you
[1645.08 --> 1653.16]  buy this shopping list of products you can achieve this look and it just add to cart yeah that would
[1653.16 --> 1658.04]  actually probably be oh it would do great but there's just it's just i've never seen anything
[1658.04 --> 1665.16]  quite like the way that it enthusiasts are driven by price like i remember having this conversation with
[1665.16 --> 1670.52]  asus one time when they came out showing us their whole lineup of upcoming motherboards for i mean
[1670.52 --> 1676.20]  it must have been z68 or something like that at this point z77 i don't know it was like it was way
[1676.20 --> 1681.88]  way back a thousand years ago and i was looking at going i think this is madness i mean these are the
[1681.88 --> 1686.28]  only two skews that sell anyway the deluxe the pro actually three skews you got the deluxe the pro and
[1686.28 --> 1693.80]  the lx or le or whatever whatever the like the basic one is and then you got your matx nothing else
[1693.80 --> 1699.72]  actually moves in any appreciable volume at least from our perspective so why don't you just take
[1699.72 --> 1704.92]  those two and this was pre-rgb right i was like why don't you just take those two ship them in three
[1704.92 --> 1711.08]  different colors do a blue one a red one and like an all black one and like honestly i think that would
[1711.08 --> 1717.00]  be that would be more to customers taste because remember i was coming at it from like an enthusiast
[1717.00 --> 1723.32]  system standpoint right so i'm i'm looking at it going you guys have no idea do you how many people
[1723.32 --> 1728.92]  choose a gigabyte motherboard for the blue color scheme compared to your product like actually i
[1728.92 --> 1733.96]  think asus's was blue at that point as well but maybe it was msi and some other color uh but i was
[1733.96 --> 1738.04]  just sitting here going you have no idea how many people choose a motherboard based on the color do
[1738.04 --> 1743.48]  you you could just say you could have the same number of skews and just have a few different colors
[1743.48 --> 1748.60]  of the ones people actually buy and i think you'd be better off and they were like no linus you have
[1748.60 --> 1754.44]  no idea the three dollar difference between these two allows us to capture like this some some
[1754.44 --> 1760.36]  percentage additional sales because someone else will have one will undercut us by two dollars and
[1760.36 --> 1770.44]  like people will flock to it i'm like really okay fine sure i guess that's i guess that's apparently how
[1770.44 --> 1778.04]  it works um people are talking about amazon as an alternative to new egg but amazon has their own set of
[1778.04 --> 1783.48]  issues guys like let's not pretend that amazon is some kind of saint that's going to rescue us from
[1783.48 --> 1789.96]  big bad new egg good customer service yes good everything else it gets a little bit more challenging
[1789.96 --> 1798.84]  with amazon dfi yeah bring back dfi heck yeah love it oh that's a that's an that's an old memory yeah
[1798.84 --> 1805.32]  no kidding right oh i'd love it what was that graphics card brand that had lifetime warranties
[1805.32 --> 1811.80]  uh oh was it gainward did gainward have a lifetime warranty at some oh bfg bfg yeah good old bfg oh
[1812.76 --> 1819.40]  awesome uh they were doomed to fail it was awesome alden comey says hey linus wouldn't the two percent
[1819.40 --> 1825.56]  extra margin basically be the warranties that dell and others pedal i mean yeah you could think about it
[1825.56 --> 1833.00]  that way that is an important realization that you just had aiden comell there is no free lunch
[1834.68 --> 1840.60]  it's true though yeah it's true though a lot of people don't consider it that same buddy i told you
[1840.60 --> 1846.84]  about yeah that uh i said mentor at geek squad or whatever yeah he had that tattooed on his arm just
[1846.84 --> 1853.00]  the just the acronym there's no such thing as a free lunch it's very true it's so true and i i think
[1853.00 --> 1857.56]  that there's just this expectation like a lot of the times we fall victim to the monsters we've created
[1858.36 --> 1866.44]  why is it that you know you're why is it that you know service at this chain restaurant is so bad
[1867.08 --> 1872.28]  because you went there you went to that chain restaurant instead of supporting a local
[1872.28 --> 1879.16]  entrepreneur that actually cares yep that that's why yeah and because the server doesn't get paid
[1879.16 --> 1883.96]  enough you going there so other people saw that this place is being attended so they're like it's
[1883.96 --> 1889.96]  probably not that bad so then they might go there etc so we we all we all contribute to these problems
[1889.96 --> 1895.16]  that we then that we then suffer from and you know things like like i said not being willing to pay
[1895.16 --> 1899.72]  another dollar or another two dollars more or whatever the case may be means that yeah at some point
[1899.72 --> 1906.36]  customer service is going to suffer and the it industry is notoriously low margin there are a
[1906.36 --> 1912.04]  couple of big fish that are making the vast majority of the money in the it industry and their names are
[1912.04 --> 1921.88]  intel amd only lately though um microsoft uh who else is actually making money nvidia actually makes money
[1923.88 --> 1929.64]  nvidia let's see is there anyone else that's i mean i know that the guys like in asus are making money
[1929.64 --> 1936.76]  but it's only due to their just astronomical scale and when you're someone like an evga you know you
[1936.76 --> 1942.28]  are you are trying to find you're always trying to find new higher margin businesses to expand into
[1942.28 --> 1949.24]  because i know for a fact they're not making money on selling gpus apple apple absolutely makes money
[1949.96 --> 1955.88]  apple i left out because i don't really consider apple an it product company they're a consumer electronics
[1955.88 --> 1963.40]  company and i the reason i draw that line is because they don't sell any components if that kind of
[1963.40 --> 1969.96]  makes sense to you guys everything that apple sells is already based on the user experience rather than
[1969.96 --> 1976.60]  the speeds and feeds of the component that they are shipping to you and so they're a little bit uh
[1976.60 --> 1981.08]  they're they're a tier they're a tier above there's a lot of people in chat just listing
[1982.04 --> 1987.72]  companies that develop software or websites that's not the point yeah it or hardware yeah
[1987.72 --> 1993.56]  and especially enthusiast computer hardware yep um because once you get into you mentioned it once
[1993.56 --> 1999.72]  you get into enterprise stuff margins start to kind of oh yeah totally different definitely come back
[1999.72 --> 2010.44]  totally different story totally different story ibm come on what what what i okay come on guys yeah
[2010.44 --> 2016.76]  ibm is a technology company yes but i wouldn't call them i wouldn't call them like an it company in
[2016.76 --> 2021.32]  the sense that we're talking about when we say it industry we're we're talking about like the computer
[2021.32 --> 2027.96]  hardware industry and maybe that's just one of those things where i'm used to using that lingo because
[2027.96 --> 2033.00]  within the it industry that's how we refer to ourselves so we would talk about things like
[2034.12 --> 2040.28]  a receiver or a television as consumer electronics because they're sort of a pre-packaged
[2040.28 --> 2046.84]  thing and we would talk about software as like software and services industry um so there that's
[2046.84 --> 2050.60]  the the clarification that i should give you guys that's why i'm using that terminology the way that
[2050.60 --> 2057.48]  i do noctua yep yep part patharty or whatever your name is yeah like fans and cases yep that's a
[2057.48 --> 2062.20]  company that makes money hand over fist as far as i can tell they're smart they're super smart
[2062.20 --> 2067.88]  peripherals have always kind of survived with better margins peripherals seem like they're getting pretty
[2067.88 --> 2074.12]  tough man probably do you see how much you see how much a g502 proteus or g502 hero goes for now
[2074.68 --> 2081.80]  it's like 45 bucks yeah for a hero sensor like the tooling cost so much on a device like that space
[2081.80 --> 2085.48]  and so many new companies coming in well it's because everyone flocked to it going oh well
[2085.48 --> 2088.76]  there's margin here it's kind of like what happened with power supplies there used to be great margin
[2088.76 --> 2094.20]  in power supplies and then everyone and their dog came in dumped all over it oh we're a fan company we
[2094.20 --> 2099.40]  make power supplies now yeah exactly that happened like crazy we put a power supply around our fan
[2101.00 --> 2106.92]  you're welcome good job hey fun fact uh speaking of power supply companies did you know that antech still
[2106.92 --> 2113.88]  exists no yeah i thought we did a show on them not existing no no no they totally still exist check this
[2113.88 --> 2124.60]  out so i was thinking of doing an antech build like an all antech pc right how cool would that be i
[2124.60 --> 2130.12]  haven't even heard this name they even have df as a as a product line name still does it still stand for
[2130.12 --> 2140.12]  dark fleet i have no idea the original dark fleet was awful awful whoa whoa whoa whoa a cash for 51 you need to
[2140.12 --> 2153.24]  sit down antech are a psu company cases surely are you serious right now no no no no no no you need
[2153.24 --> 2162.28]  you need you need you need to sit down okay antech is the og power supply company oh yeah along with
[2162.28 --> 2167.48]  enter max i think pretty much everyone i knew had an antech power supply at least at one point for
[2167.48 --> 2175.48]  enthusiasts for gamers antech was the yeah okay back in the day oh yeah apparently they're huge in
[2175.48 --> 2186.76]  bangladesh still it's sitting yeah for real yeah man my first enthusiast build antech land boy with built-in
[2186.76 --> 2196.44]  blue led lit 350 watt power supply love it one of my good buddies uh used to have a lamb boy air nice
[2197.00 --> 2203.88]  just the dust machine dude that was a unique that was a unique case yeah okay it was an unusual case it
[2203.88 --> 2211.88]  definitely was this is cool i i really thought they didn't are they still like in north america i don't
[2211.88 --> 2217.00]  know as far as i as far as i can tell yes i haven't actually tried to buy any of their stuff but it
[2217.00 --> 2222.04]  kind of seems like it and they're they're doing a lot of sort of normal looking stuff they're also
[2222.04 --> 2227.16]  doing some weird stuff they've got this reverse fan which is what actually brought them back on my radar
[2227.16 --> 2236.28]  so it's a fan that blows air away from the hub instead of the other way why don't you just
[2236.28 --> 2245.88]  why you need this i have no idea oh okay no i get it i actually get it now for aesthetics so you don't
[2245.88 --> 2255.72]  have to see the label okay it's uh a very champagne problem for sure but it okay i i get it at least
[2256.44 --> 2262.68]  i understand okay what are we supposed to be talking about now australia bangladesh belgium canada
[2262.68 --> 2273.88]  yeah where's us so usa yeah back to new eggs uh scammy return system um i guess yeah what what i want
[2273.88 --> 2279.40]  to know is i want to hear from you guys if you've had the same experience i want you guys to know that
[2279.40 --> 2287.96]  there's probably a mixture of blame to go around it certainly doesn't all lie on new egg however in the
[2287.96 --> 2294.68]  case of what happened with steve it looks like it's pretty clear that this was either new egg
[2294.68 --> 2302.44]  screwing up or new egg ripping him off and it's very hard for me to tell exactly which one either way
[2302.44 --> 2310.52]  they picked the wrong guy to screw with like yeah i would absolutely be creeping like major major tech
[2310.52 --> 2316.12]  media outlets and seeing who works there and making sure that they're all just on the do fly list
[2316.12 --> 2320.20]  yeah i was like i didn't even really want to say it because like i don't want to give them ideas
[2320.20 --> 2327.88]  but yeah i would if i worked there like why would you not i would absolutely do that and like yes your
[2327.88 --> 2332.92]  your company should have standards that are high enough that it shouldn't matter absolutely but i
[2332.92 --> 2340.04]  would make sure that if steven burke buys something from lttstore.com and sends in a support ticket he is
[2340.04 --> 2346.20]  getting the white glove service i will personally steven burke i will personally reply to your support
[2346.20 --> 2352.84]  ticket oh crap i probably won't yeah now you have to tell the customer support people that yeah no
[2352.84 --> 2357.24]  what forget you know what i take it back i take it back i will not personally reply to your support ticket
[2358.28 --> 2365.16]  oh man you guys should have a reverse policy where like if steven burke buys something on lttstore you
[2365.16 --> 2370.28]  like screw him over i know right we should just ship him a bag of sand at his cost
[2374.44 --> 2379.32]  oh man like this is how companies usually treat you so it's probably fine yeah exactly you're used
[2379.32 --> 2388.12]  to it you're used to it steve give him the new egg special yeah i love it all right um what else are we
[2388.12 --> 2397.72]  supposed to talk about today uh oh yeah sony to acquire bungie for 3.6 billion how ironic is this
[2398.60 --> 2405.88]  very very funny very interesting i mean i'm a little i'm a little rough around the edges on the history
[2405.88 --> 2416.36]  here okay but was it not bungie that put the xbox on the map at all wasn't the xbox kind of just a black
[2416.36 --> 2427.32]  box until like come on man and i i can try to go find the quote right now but um the the head of
[2427.32 --> 2434.36]  xbox if i remember correctly fairly recently in an interview was talked to about bungie and he talked
[2434.36 --> 2441.64]  about how like he feels that modern xbox like the company not the console yeah would be able to retain
[2441.64 --> 2447.56]  bungie and he was like yeah like we didn't like maybe i don't know how he worded it and i'm not
[2447.56 --> 2449.88]  reading the article in front of me but it's something along the lines of like we didn't
[2449.88 --> 2453.96]  necessarily deserve them at the time like we weren't doing the right things we weren't facilitating
[2453.96 --> 2458.20]  right properly all this kind of stuff but i think we would now we are now all that kind of stuff
[2459.16 --> 2465.32]  i would not be surprised if there was conversation going on there and then they went to sony which is
[2465.32 --> 2476.44]  really interesting it's just crazy also 3.6 billion when like i'm pretty sure it's just destiny right
[2476.44 --> 2481.72]  now they do say like uh bungie of course is studio behind the original halo which is still owned by
[2481.72 --> 2487.72]  microsoft and the following franchises marathon pre-halo fps that's like i really don't see them
[2487.72 --> 2497.32]  doing anything with marathon yeah myth oni and destiny so destiny so destiny okay is this only as
[2497.32 --> 2504.20]  an oni of the dark forest forest it's worth mentioning that while other titles from acquired
[2504.20 --> 2509.48]  studios have remained cross-platform for contractual reason bungie's future contractual reasons bungie's
[2509.48 --> 2515.00]  future plan titles are still slated to come out on other platforms in addition bungie says that they
[2515.00 --> 2521.48]  will be retaining creative freedom although i mean yeah i don't know i don't i don't i don't know how
[2521.48 --> 2529.00]  you i don't know how you can say that with complete certainty like if i sold linus media group and the
[2529.00 --> 2537.96]  buyer said you will retain creative freedom maybe there's a way to write a contract that actually guarantees
[2537.96 --> 2544.20]  it but i also feel like the buyer would be crazy some type of loophole there there's something they can do
[2544.20 --> 2548.84]  they'd be crazy not to have a clause in the contract that says i mean well if you screw it up then
[2548.84 --> 2554.12]  we're coming in and they could probably also just fire you yeah we'll oust you yeah um it's like you
[2554.12 --> 2558.76]  look at oculus and they just fired them right they just fired like everybody from the original team
[2558.76 --> 2564.28]  oni is uh is not what i thought it's not only in the dark forest it's just called oni and it was
[2564.28 --> 2570.92]  released in 2001. so as far as i can tell all these uh all these things are just done except for
[2570.92 --> 2578.28]  destiny destiny is big destiny is a big game it's been very successful every time they release an
[2578.28 --> 2582.68]  expansion whatever it sells really well people in that community seem pretty happy for the most part
[2582.68 --> 2592.36]  yeah so like it's a big thing for sony to get but 3.6 billion bang bang it's um yeah consolidation bad
[2592.36 --> 2598.44]  i don't think we need to go over that way too much more um yeah there's uh there's some some
[2598.44 --> 2605.08]  speculation that sony is after ip there uh game engine technology there's some speculation that
[2605.08 --> 2610.20]  sony might want to move into more of a publishing role um maybe it's a cloud gaming move
[2610.84 --> 2617.32]  um sony does cite bungie's experience with multi-platform development and live game services as
[2617.32 --> 2622.28]  a primary motivator for the purchase which they're honestly they're they're multi-platform live game
[2622.28 --> 2628.04]  service is has been just killing it for a long time so that's very legit uh people in chat are also
[2628.04 --> 2633.72]  saying new ip is coming so yep that probably makes sense as well that's pretty that's pretty fair it's
[2633.72 --> 2640.52]  i would i also think and i'm sure everyone is aware of this that buying bungie is a bit of a blow to
[2640.52 --> 2646.68]  microsoft oh oh i i think it's pretty clear that there's a message being sent here and i wouldn't be
[2646.68 --> 2654.76]  surprised if a little bit of that price tag was like hey come on you are uh you are buying bungie away
[2654.76 --> 2659.56]  from microsoft even if they don't own it um because they were kind of dangling out there on their own
[2659.56 --> 2665.72]  for a little while right and uh being attached to something that is not microsoft now is is a statement
[2665.72 --> 2673.48]  even though they weren't owned by microsoft microsoft can still just buy sony oh my god well
[2674.68 --> 2680.36]  i don't see that i don't see that ever happening that's not going to be allowed yeah the the japanese
[2680.36 --> 2685.64]  government is just not gonna let that be a thing i just think the american government would either
[2685.64 --> 2689.96]  like i don't think anyone's gonna be cool with that yeah i i don't think that's happening guys
[2690.60 --> 2695.56]  what is happening though sponsor sponsor spots absolutely let's do it uh the show is brought to
[2695.56 --> 2703.48]  you today by grid studio uh grid studios art frames show off the art hidden inside technology
[2703.48 --> 2709.16]  oh okay you you talk about the next bit i gotta grab something uh okay like the next monster spot
[2709.16 --> 2718.12]  no no just the next talking oh okay uh apparently over a billion of the money for bungee no no no no
[2718.12 --> 2725.80]  for grid studio okay hold on oh using the art of knolling every part from your favorite phone or console
[2726.44 --> 2736.28]  is carefully extracted laid out this is actually super cool and labeled in clear view oh they sent an
[2736.28 --> 2743.88]  iphone 4 this was my first smartphone oh that's not really counting my blackberry that is so cool
[2745.40 --> 2752.52]  i mean it's a lot better than being in a landfill at least it delays it oh that's that is super cute
[2752.52 --> 2758.76]  cool they put a little like mac face in there and you've got a game boy pocket yeah nice yeah my grandma
[2758.76 --> 2763.80]  bought my brother and i game boy pockets when we were really young they have over 30 different frames
[2763.80 --> 2770.20]  available from the sega game gear to the iphone 10 and these so these look absolutely amazing the
[2770.20 --> 2775.32]  presentation is so nice i like how they're like labeled out and everything too because like you
[2775.32 --> 2779.96]  probably know if it's your thing but if you're hanging this on the wall you're very likely going
[2779.96 --> 2784.04]  to get a question about it because it's a very interesting piece to have yeah that's so cool and it's i
[2784.04 --> 2789.72]  i i yeah i don't know that's pretty sweet it's no nft or anything but it looks all right it says
[2789.72 --> 2796.92]  pause the chronic oh my goodness come on it's probably cheaper than nft um i also like how they put like
[2796.92 --> 2801.56]  a graphic of tetris inside the game boy screen yeah that's super cool so you can kind of see what it
[2801.56 --> 2806.92]  would do and it's in black and white which makes sense i love it that's sweet that's awesome uh the show

[2909.64 --> 2913.64]  know which one is right but one of them is you'll figure it out you'll i believe that this is smart
[2914.92 --> 2921.48]  you know it's not smart facebook you know what's sad what i wore this in morning today
[2921.48 --> 2930.20]  oh ltx 2019 shirt thanks for that yeah anyways yeah facebook 252 billion dollars gone uh as far as
[2930.20 --> 2937.16]  wikipedia is concerned the gdp of finland um wow amazing and to be clear we're not talking actual
[2937.16 --> 2944.92]  dollars we're talking valuation calculated value um yeah brutal apparently average usage of facebook
[2944.92 --> 2951.96]  dipped for the first time ever leading to concern that instagram may not be far behind uh meta's cfo
[2951.96 --> 2959.32]  dave werner blames when part winner i don't know sure uh blames part of the decrease on fewer
[2959.32 --> 2965.48]  covet 19 lockdowns darn you should really uh crank on that a little more uh which historically generated a
[2965.48 --> 2975.96]  boom in online activity i mean he's not wrong but like why would you say that exactly why that sounds
[2976.60 --> 2985.00]  uh like you're the cfo of meta um yeah kind of doesn't it also blamed the rising internet costs in
[2985.00 --> 2990.04]  india and rising interest in tick tock which analysts say is hurting instagram's growth to combat
[2990.04 --> 2994.92]  tick tock instagram has been investing billions of dollars and lots of development time into the
[2994.92 --> 3000.04]  development of more video related features which they say is their like fastest growing thing on
[3000.04 --> 3006.92]  instagram reels fastest growing format format by far but is not popular yet to attract similar ad
[3006.92 --> 3016.84]  sales to traditional facebook services yeah so um as a result of these challenges including lower than
[3016.84 --> 3024.36]  expected revenue metabook has lost 252 billion that's with nine zeros on the end and they aren't alone
[3024.36 --> 3029.48]  twitter snap and pinterest all closed lower on thursday however shopify has been struggling too
[3029.48 --> 3034.44]  a lot of tech stocks have been struck this is interesting metabook's wipeout here is the biggest
[3034.44 --> 3044.84]  crash in a single day in stock market history 26.3 of the company's value evaporated nice and this
[3044.84 --> 3050.84]  isn't the first time their stock crashed in 2018 they also lost 19 of their value over slowing user growth
[3050.84 --> 3057.16]  yeah like a lot of the speculated value of that company is based on projected eventual growth yes
[3057.16 --> 3062.36]  so if if they stop growing then everyone goes whoa whoa whoa and if they even stop growing like crazy
[3062.36 --> 3068.84]  yeah because so much of it is just based on speculation that they can only go to the moon yeah
[3069.40 --> 3076.92]  which is not it's not true stocks only go up oh man that's how it works um yeah brutal
[3076.92 --> 3085.64]  so our discussion question here is is facebook dying or is this just more of a more of a snap
[3085.64 --> 3090.84]  back to a more realistic valuation after pandemic highs facebook that we're talking about right now is
[3090.84 --> 3095.08]  is the greater facebook services or whatever you want to call them that includes instagram
[3095.08 --> 3101.08]  yes yes i think facebook so meta fine let's call them meta sure metabook i like metabook better
[3101.08 --> 3105.88]  mine yeah metabook because that maybe doesn't include vr stuff i don't know no it does because it's
[3105.88 --> 3110.68]  like the meta quest yeah which is horrible yeah i know right you had such a good brand why would
[3110.68 --> 3118.44]  you just burn it yeah like oculus is such a cool name compared to meta that is just stupid yep can we
[3118.44 --> 3124.84]  just like can we just trash on this whole metaverse thing for a little bit here sure tell me something
[3124.84 --> 3128.84]  why do people think it's going to be one thing this has been the most confusing thing for me the entire
[3128.84 --> 3134.04]  time why why why does anyone think it's me wife one thing and why does every company individually
[3134.04 --> 3138.84]  think they are going to have sole ownership of the one thing that exists it has made no sense to me
[3138.84 --> 3145.88]  the entire time here's what i want to know why does anyone think this is new that too have i ever
[3145.88 --> 3155.16]  talked on the wan show about the palace the palace the palace the palace was a chat room that i used to
[3155.16 --> 3161.96]  use yeah back in the late 90s early 2000s not many people are gonna remember that as far as i can tell
[3163.00 --> 3169.80]  was the metaverse okay because they here this is what it looked like so rudimentary by today's standards
[3170.52 --> 3177.88]  you would go into you would go into rooms so you can see here um you can see how many people were in a
[3177.88 --> 3184.20]  room and you would have avatars which were actually not a single image so you could actually you could mix and
[3184.20 --> 3189.88]  match them you could have a like a top middle and bottom and like skater boy avatars were super
[3189.88 --> 3195.08]  popular at the time i'm sure they were because it was the late 90s and like skater girl avatars kids
[3195.08 --> 3200.52]  look like uh people traded avatars they had an actual like there was some there was some commerce
[3200.52 --> 3206.44]  and then there was some commerce around avatars where you could pay people to make them for you
[3206.44 --> 3211.16]  because the skill of actually creating these avatars at that time was not something that was common
[3211.16 --> 3216.60]  cool right supporting artists directly um why not let's see if i can find some of those just like
[3217.16 --> 3221.56]  uh this seems to be more modern it's actually apparently been resurrected so i'm trying to
[3221.56 --> 3226.92]  find some original stuff this is this looks og uh because your default was this weird smiley face
[3228.12 --> 3232.44]  um yeah let me see if i can find any screenshots that actually look like they're from way back then
[3232.44 --> 3241.88]  but basically you would join a palace and a palace would contain multiple rooms so uh corns uh south
[3241.88 --> 3248.28]  park had one like it was actually kind of mainstream within certain circles and then different rooms could
[3248.28 --> 3254.68]  have different themes and the way that the chat worked was you could whisper to people so okay you'd see
[3254.68 --> 3259.56]  people right next to each other like these two they're probably whispering so nobody else can see what they're
[3259.56 --> 3266.92]  typing but you could also communicate openly kind of like this and you would just have a speech bubble
[3266.92 --> 3274.12]  that would come up like this is as far as i can tell pretty much the metaverse but like 2d metaverse
[3275.16 --> 3282.12]  correct me if i'm wrong help me out here there's also like if we want to move past this a little bit
[3282.12 --> 3294.76]  as well there's uh second life here we go here we go this is it this is palace avatars circa 1999 in a nutshell
[3296.20 --> 3303.56]  this was basically everything they've got gene code jeans too everyone and their dog was rocking this
[3303.56 --> 3310.92]  oh i love it and there was a bunch of these right it wasn't just the palace well haba hotel came later
[3310.92 --> 3315.40]  i would say haba hotel was kind of the spiritual success oh i'm not saying there's a bunch that were
[3315.40 --> 3319.40]  before this but there was a lot of different like chat room things where you could get different
[3319.40 --> 3325.96]  avatars and whatnot um and then second life is like legitimately it yeah right like there was you could
[3325.96 --> 3331.56]  set up businesses there yeah you could you could build buildings you you could do all the normal
[3331.56 --> 3336.76]  things you'd do in normal lifeland um and it was mostly filled with weird people by the end but
[3336.76 --> 3343.56]  that's okay um no comment there was uh i can tell you the palace definitely had some weird people on it
[3344.12 --> 3349.32]  anytime you have a anonymized internet chat room thing it's just going to happen there's a lot of asl
[3349.32 --> 3355.96]  going around let me say that and i don't mean american sign language yeah that's what i'm talking about
[3355.96 --> 3362.68]  um i have no idea who i chatted with all those years ago i mean i was smart enough to never meet
[3362.68 --> 3371.96]  up with anyone in person but i know people that were not okay i shouldn't use the term smart i was
[3372.52 --> 3379.88]  savvy enough educated enough sure cautious enough there because smart people can make big mistakes oh
[3379.88 --> 3383.16]  yeah you want me to tell you about a big mistake i made once or do you want to do are you in the middle
[3383.16 --> 3387.96]  of a story go ahead uh no i mean not particularly all i was saying is i i know people personally
[3387.96 --> 3392.60]  that made the mistake of meeting up with people in real life that they that they only knew online
[3392.60 --> 3397.48]  especially back then because these days it's a little bit easier you can see with stuff like
[3397.48 --> 3404.04]  facebook and and webcam conversations you can see people more directly but back then you had no idea
[3404.04 --> 3409.80]  usually um even now it's very dangerous and you should be very careful but anyways um yeah second life
[3409.80 --> 3414.52]  is like legitimately it and is still totally around vr chat a lot of people have positioned
[3414.52 --> 3418.76]  people have mentioned this in chat and i've seen it previously as well vr chat has been positioned as
[3418.76 --> 3426.92]  what this thing is um yeah i think right now it's extremely buzzwordy oh yeah and i think there's
[3426.92 --> 3431.88]  some internet of things i think there's some savvy business people and tech people that are going to get
[3431.88 --> 3438.52]  themselves in positions in companies based around work on the metaverse in order to make very large amounts of
[3438.52 --> 3444.92]  money produce probably nothing and then move on to the next thing that's yeah sorry story of when you
[3444.92 --> 3452.36]  made a mistake you want to hear about the day i turned into a cynical jaded misanthrope oh my yeah yes
[3452.36 --> 3461.48]  so i generally believed in the fundamental goodness of people and i was a pretty trusting person
[3461.48 --> 3470.52]  um until i had a very very bad experience that really came down to my own naivety okay
[3472.92 --> 3480.04]  when i was in high school i had someone approach me on the street saying that they were in a bind
[3481.16 --> 3487.80]  they had a they had a check that they needed to cash for whatever reason their bank uh wouldn't do it
[3487.80 --> 3493.40]  they would endorse it to me and if i could give them like at least most of the cash that it was for
[3494.28 --> 3498.36]  and it was like a hundred and some dollars or something like that so it was a non-trivial amount
[3498.36 --> 3504.60]  of money and somehow i let them sweet talk me into cashing a check for them essentially
[3506.76 --> 3515.08]  i even knew that it was sketchy so i i like i was like okay well i i'm gonna take a picture with you
[3515.08 --> 3520.04]  so that i know who you are and i can report this if you if you're scamming me here and they took the
[3520.04 --> 3527.00]  picture with me and everything but i got i got talked into going to an atm withdrawing cash handing
[3527.00 --> 3534.44]  it to someone having them endorse this check putting it in and not only was i obviously out the money
[3534.44 --> 3541.64]  because yeah it didn't go through but i got charged for trying to cash a bad check and that was when i that
[3541.64 --> 3549.40]  was when i i realized i was like oh someone can seem totally nice totally chill swear on their
[3549.40 --> 3556.36]  mother's grave that they are they are not out to hurt you and stab you right in the face and i was like
[3556.36 --> 3563.56]  oh okay well this is really good to know um yeah that's rough yeah yeah and it was just it was just one
[3563.56 --> 3570.12]  of those things like i was i was young i was naive i didn't know better and i i i guess what i'm saying
[3570.12 --> 3577.08]  is like i understand how people can make mistakes i'm really tech savvy i've spent my entire life on
[3577.08 --> 3585.08]  the internet so i i saw some you you need the experience to not to not make a similar or related
[3585.08 --> 3591.00]  mistake in the future you kind of have to screw up well everyone i feel like i shouldn't say everyone
[3591.00 --> 3597.48]  because maybe some people just can get wisdom by just knowing from someone else or whatever speaking of
[3597.48 --> 3602.52]  getting wisdom i just realized we should probably tell people what's happening which merch messages
[3602.52 --> 3606.84]  right now um oh because we didn't tell them about the replies thing oh yeah i've been going on this
[3606.84 --> 3612.36]  whole show oh yeah cool uh well hopefully people noticed that when they send in merch messages a lot
[3612.36 --> 3618.12]  of the time the reply comes up right with your merch message yeah i would hope people would notice that
[3618.12 --> 3625.48]  but it looks very similar to a merch message though so anytime you see the the ltte with rgb lights behind it
[3625.48 --> 3633.08]  that's a reply to the very thing you saw right before it yeah so we we have a producer now which
[3633.08 --> 3638.76]  is fantastic yeah and he's and sometimes it might be us so far i think it's pretty much just been the
[3638.76 --> 3644.52]  producer but uh they have the ability to respond to you because sometimes we've gotten feedback that a lot
[3644.52 --> 3647.64]  of times we're answering the same question that we've been answering for the last over and over and
[3647.64 --> 3653.56]  over again um so we're trying to address some of those questions with text now so that it doesn't eat into
[3653.56 --> 3661.64]  the showtime um it's ski blue asks what do you gain from doing a scam like that you gain my money money
[3661.64 --> 3667.80]  yeah because i gave the guy cash because remember linus would get a small portion of it yep which
[3667.80 --> 3673.00]  realistically you you probably got a fee for trying to cash a a false check and he had a whole story
[3673.00 --> 3680.52]  about how he really needed it and his bank uh was closed and what bank did i bank at are they still open
[3680.52 --> 3691.00]  it was like it was a whole thing it was i just um yeah i uh yeah i i made a mistake right right and
[3691.00 --> 3699.24]  where i was going with that was that recently we did a video where i basically condemned people piling on to
[3699.24 --> 3705.00]  folks that fall for online scams because we need people to have the confidence to come forward and
[3705.00 --> 3710.68]  talk about it because that's a big part of how you educate people like you can't you can't just say
[3710.68 --> 3715.80]  you can't just keep it hush hush every time you condemn someone for falling for that you're you're
[3715.80 --> 3720.68]  making sure the scammers win again some other time exactly you're part of the problem at that point so
[3720.68 --> 3726.36]  we just need to we need to say okay you know hey here's what we could do better next time but try
[3726.36 --> 3731.32]  not to shame people about it is what i'm what i'm trying to say feel free to shame me my feelings won't be
[3731.32 --> 3736.92]  hurt but in in general you don't not everyone's used to just being a public figure and being
[3736.92 --> 3740.44]  constantly shamed for their horrible hot takes right
[3743.24 --> 3748.36]  yeah it's true private privateering my privateering my my feelings
[3750.36 --> 3755.64]  uh actually now's uh now's a good time for you to make it up to me uh you can head to ltdstore.com
[3755.64 --> 3766.68]  uh where we just launched two adorable plushies we've got the controller plushie we've got the
[3766.68 --> 3772.12]  computer plushie these are based on the same characters from the abcs of gaming board book
[3772.12 --> 3778.44]  that sarah and i worked on together uh i guess oh man i guess it was over a year ago and we have a
[3778.44 --> 3786.36]  special promo to run with it if you pick up a plushie with code abc plush you can get an abcs of
[3786.36 --> 3794.12]  gaming book for only five bucks so it's a combo deal where you are saving i think that works out to a
[3794.12 --> 3800.76]  ten dollar saving savings if you pick up the plushie and the book i don't know how long that's running but
[3800.76 --> 3805.80]  computer monitor not for very long probably because that's a pretty aggressive promo so thank you for that
[3805.80 --> 3816.76]  nick um sure why not oh oh this is cool apparently the first newsletter of the year went out today
[3816.76 --> 3822.68]  uh shoot i'm not logged into the account that is on the newsletter does it automatically publish to a
[3822.68 --> 3828.84]  blog yet no oh crap we're working on that we we are i mean it probably would have been there conrad
[3828.84 --> 3834.84]  wanted to push it and i was like no oh crap wait till monday uh okay i'm gonna try and get logged
[3834.84 --> 3837.48]  into that account in the meantime do you want to do another topic sure
[3842.52 --> 3846.44]  or were we in the middle of something had i just i don't remember to be completely honest
[3847.16 --> 3853.00]  um facebook losing money did we finish that topic yeah i kind of feel like it uh there was a question
[3853.00 --> 3858.60]  at the end saying is this a good thing i mean metabook is popular is a popular punching bag but should
[3858.60 --> 3867.24]  they really crash and burn um a wise take was yes cw's yes that's colin a s's take was yes that's uh our
[3867.24 --> 3877.16]  new guy okay what do you think the the team is the team is unanimous um it's a complicated question
[3877.16 --> 3883.48]  because like facebook losing value uh a publicly traded company so that means people with stocks lose
[3883.48 --> 3888.92]  value yeah it means real people actually like lost money today i i don't a decent amount of the
[3888.92 --> 3894.28]  ownership of facebook is probably in the hands of people that i'm not very concerned about that's
[3894.28 --> 3903.00]  fair as well but facebook also has a lot of retail investors there is probably a lot of uh yeah non one
[3903.00 --> 3907.48]  percent or two percenters that have ownership there as well and i'm never rooting for that no
[3907.48 --> 3912.76]  uh i mean even the one percent i think we need to stop vilifying the one percent quite as much
[3913.64 --> 3918.04]  because it's the it's the okay here hold on a second hold on are you saying we should widen it
[3918.76 --> 3924.84]  widen it well you can't widen it because it's one percent no your scope like should you go beyond one
[3924.84 --> 3932.12]  no no no no no okay so hold on one percent top earners hold on where is it one percent top earners in
[3932.12 --> 3940.68]  canada okay so the one percent in canada is hold on is this household income much lower canada's lower
[3940.68 --> 3945.48]  population than california yeah but but it's a dollar value but this is this is facebook ownership so
[3945.48 --> 3954.04]  you'd have to include americans okay sure okay top one percent earners in u.s okay so what is that the
[3954.04 --> 3959.80]  top one percent represents about 1.3 million households who roughly make more than five hundred thousand dollars
[3959.80 --> 3966.44]  a year okay that's higher than it is in canada okay that seems like a bit of a problem because
[3966.44 --> 3972.12]  in canada i'm not very worried if people who make over 500 grand a year see a loss in canada we're
[3972.12 --> 3978.84]  talking 320 000 canadian so that's a that's like under a quarter million u.s a year so you're talking
[3978.84 --> 3982.92]  like potentially like a neurosurgeon or something like that you're not talking someone who's just
[3983.56 --> 3989.32]  making money through flexing their money these are people that conceivably are actually
[3990.36 --> 3996.92]  working it depends uh day to day not all of them but i'm saying what i'm trying to say is i don't
[3996.92 --> 4004.44]  think neurosurgeon person who who has to pay off their immense student debt and might have facebook
[4004.44 --> 4011.96]  shares yeah i don't wish that sure stuff goes down i think a huge percentage of people that are in that
[4011.96 --> 4017.32]  section that are not neurosurgeons and maybe inherited a bunch of wealth or whatever else well that's not
[4017.32 --> 4023.72]  earnings though so you okay because there's two there's two different ways of measuring the one
[4023.72 --> 4029.80]  percent okay yeah right because you can either measure it by income and there are actual working
[4029.80 --> 4034.28]  people that make a quarter million dollars a year because they just happen to be like really really
[4034.28 --> 4039.16]  good at something specialized i have no problem with that whatsoever yeah but once you get into we're
[4039.16 --> 4045.16]  not saying whether or not we have a problem with it we're saying if we uh feel bad because facebook
[4045.16 --> 4051.72]  stock this is a weird conversation we're saying uh if we feel bad because they lost money or value or
[4051.72 --> 4058.68]  whatever um because facebook stock went down sure i guess what i'm trying to say is
[4060.36 --> 4067.00]  i feel bad because not every investor in facebook is some kind of cartoon villain yeah
[4067.56 --> 4072.20]  there's retail investors certain that there are people that are invested in facebook
[4072.20 --> 4077.72]  that are grinding super hard in very very low paid jobs sure i've been saving everything they
[4077.72 --> 4081.80]  possibly can to try to get into the stock market because that's what a lot of people tell you to do
[4081.80 --> 4085.16]  and they're trying to dig themselves out of whatever they can by doing that type of stuff
[4085.16 --> 4089.48]  and they might be invested in facebook and they might have just lost a lot of potential money and
[4089.48 --> 4094.20]  that could be very damaging very unfortunate i think that is probably few and far between and to be
[4094.20 --> 4100.12]  clear i'm not saying that someone in the top one percent in canada is somehow a pauper right i'm not
[4100.12 --> 4107.48]  saying that they're living in poverty i'm saying that compared to the 0.1 percent which averaged apparently
[4107.48 --> 4115.64]  1.7 million dollars in 2018 um they are relatively speaking probably actually spending a significant
[4115.64 --> 4119.48]  amount of that money putting it back into circulation because hoarding is the problem
[4120.44 --> 4126.44]  if the top 0.1 percent if the top earners were actually spending all of it because that's something
[4126.44 --> 4131.64]  that gets talked about a lot people who want to defend the wealthy they'll say well you know
[4131.64 --> 4141.40]  they they they trickle down economics they create jobs reagan they only create jobs if they spend the
[4141.40 --> 4148.92]  money on jobs that's that's the only way if they're if they're buying more art if they're using more
[4148.92 --> 4155.40]  services if they're if they're going out and it's spending a lot of money tipping thousand dollars sure or
[4155.40 --> 4162.60]  whatever if they're actually spending it then it's not really a problem that they're earning an insane
[4162.60 --> 4168.12]  amount of money but you can't control what people do with their money but at a certain point you reach
[4168.12 --> 4176.20]  you reach a level where you can't really spend that kind of money like it's not it's not hard time it's
[4176.20 --> 4183.16]  not practical and it just becomes this like penis measuring contest um so i guess what i'm saying is
[4183.16 --> 4188.92]  that compared to the one percent who conceivably are actually spending that kind of money on a yearly
[4188.92 --> 4195.48]  basis live indefinitely that good life like i'm not i'm not saying i i feel bad for them necessarily
[4195.48 --> 4200.52]  but i'm also not saying that i don't think they're villains i think that the 0.1 percent especially if
[4200.52 --> 4205.96]  they're not spending it are a much much bigger problem because i think speaking from personal
[4205.96 --> 4210.44]  experience i think spending one and a half million dollars a year would be extremely difficult
[4210.44 --> 4217.08]  like extremely difficult tell me how to do it on something other than vancouver real estate
[4217.96 --> 4221.40]  because i knew that was coming you don't have enough money if it's vancouver real estate yeah
[4221.40 --> 4228.60]  fair enough you need more come on pump it up that's your down payment boys yeah um yeah no i i i
[4229.80 --> 4235.88]  my brain doesn't really go there but what i'm sure i'm sure mr beast could find a way well but that's it
[4235.88 --> 4242.12]  he's spending it on his business he's employing people yeah that's fine oh oh to be clear i spend
[4242.12 --> 4247.80]  a lot more than a million half dollars a year on employing people our payroll here oh monstrous
[4249.80 --> 4257.16]  i would not be surprised and this is going to be really scary i would not be surprised if in 2023 2024
[4257.16 --> 4260.36]  by the time we hit that time frame if our payroll cracks
[4265.72 --> 4266.36]  eight figures
[4268.52 --> 4272.84]  i would not be surprised i'm like really getting close to finalizing some of my positions and even
[4272.84 --> 4277.48]  though the rest are not i think i'm just going to have to pull triggers on some of them because like
[4277.48 --> 4286.04]  i don't want to drag people along for for so long um and yep yep that's all i have to say um developers
[4286.04 --> 4290.44]  are expensive we're we're hiring more people in that realm we're hiring more engineers we're hiring
[4290.44 --> 4295.96]  more stuff like that that's all very expensive roles very expensive roles this is interesting guys
[4295.96 --> 4303.48]  this is a terrible terrible take um it has begun openly complaining about paying people did i complain
[4303.48 --> 4310.28]  no he's not you did not complain i said i do i said that spending a million and a half dollars is
[4310.28 --> 4318.12]  really easy when you employ a gigantic team of people but that's not what i asked i asked you to
[4318.12 --> 4323.00]  try to spend it personally in your community and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know i
[4323.00 --> 4327.08]  mean you could go to a movie every day and you wouldn't even get close uh like you couldn't okay what
[4327.08 --> 4331.00]  does that work out to here hold on let's do the math let's do the math this is this is fun
[4331.00 --> 4344.04]  a million and a half dollars okay divided by 365 is 4 109 a day okay so you're only you can only be
[4344.04 --> 4351.80]  awake for let's say 16 hours a day right you let's say you sleep okay so divided by 16 means that you
[4351.80 --> 4359.16]  are making 256 an hour not for being at work just for existing for being conscious yeah you're making
[4359.16 --> 4369.24]  256 an hour okay divided by 60 you're making four dollars and two cents a minute so what that means
[4369.24 --> 4374.92]  is that like you said are we counting things like like rent and stuff no right going to a movie okay
[4374.92 --> 4381.64]  luke going to a movie hold on hold on going to a movie which takes about two hours right two and a
[4381.64 --> 4387.08]  half hours yeah sure so what's that work out to about a hundred and let's say 160 minutes okay you buy
[4387.08 --> 4394.76]  some popcorn 160 you would have to spend 684 on that movie experience in order to come out
[4396.04 --> 4400.68]  with less money than you walked in hopefully that's that popcorn's got some of that like gold
[4400.68 --> 4407.40]  filigree on top of it or something so no luke tell me how to spend money faster what what did i
[4407.40 --> 4412.76]  divide by 160 okay hold on tell me how to spend money faster than four dollars a minute i think this
[4412.76 --> 4419.48]  is it just naturally and paintball the same okay you could if you can walk your trigger right you
[4419.48 --> 4424.44]  can go to the paintball field you buy paint at the field okay super marked up paint you go like this
[4425.08 --> 4430.04]  okay you are spending money faster than you make it giving me give me one other activity really buff
[4430.04 --> 4435.56]  fingers like even stuff you can't let up even extreme activities right like skydiving well you could
[4435.56 --> 4444.28]  you scuba diving you can only do them so often you cannot conceivably spend even a flight okay you
[4444.28 --> 4450.84]  go to a tropical location you're flying for 10 hours okay what's 10 hours work out to 600 minutes okay so
[4450.84 --> 4458.52]  times 600 they're 2500 you literally made more sitting on the plane than it cost you to fly to mexico i think
[4458.52 --> 4465.40]  a lot of people solve this problem if you want to show it that by buying property but then that problem
[4465.40 --> 4469.24]  that's investment just goes that's not spending money no i know that's what i'm saying but that's
[4469.24 --> 4474.12]  that movie called brewster's millions i think it's called there's this bad movie from the 80s where this
[4474.12 --> 4483.72]  guy gets an uh uh an inheritance but the the rich uh the rich benefactor has this these strings attached
[4483.72 --> 4491.64]  where in order to get the big inheritance they have to spend the small inheritance without um retaining
[4491.64 --> 4497.32]  any meaningful assets at the end of it and i think the idea is that they like have to get it out of
[4497.32 --> 4502.52]  their system okay or something like that and the i'm giving away the plot it's kind of a crap movie
[4502.52 --> 4508.92]  anyway so it doesn't really matter but spoiler alert he ends up running for office and then trying to
[4508.92 --> 4516.92]  lose because if he wins then he would have a he would have actually gained terrible plan yeah whatever
[4516.92 --> 4521.88]  that's why the movie sucks um they should just come up with they should have just made a movie
[4521.88 --> 4526.12]  of some guy who shoots paintballs constantly golden plated paintball you know what twitch chat
[4526.12 --> 4532.04]  apparently likes the likes the movie i enjoyed it but i watched it when i was a literal child so and
[4532.04 --> 4538.28]  i've heard it's like a bad movie so just take all this for the ignorant ignorant rambling that it is
[4539.48 --> 4545.16]  nfts easy people would people would argue that those are investments yeah people would argue that those are
[4545.16 --> 4551.88]  investments so come on hit me i i don't know i this isn't me you can't yeah you actually cannot i uh
[4551.88 --> 4558.04]  you could live that jet set life and not be able to spend that kind of money yeah i could i don't i
[4558.04 --> 4564.84]  yeah it would be a job for cocaine says the spanky i don't know how much cocaine costs but i would
[4564.84 --> 4572.12]  i would hazard consume safely i would hazard a guess that you actually could not consume enough cocaine
[4572.12 --> 4578.68]  to overcome that kind of income could you consume four thousand dollars worth of cocaine in a day i i
[4578.68 --> 4585.48]  legitimately have no idea what cocaine costs no clue okay yeah float plane chat hookers and blow okay all
[4585.48 --> 4593.40]  right okay my understanding is that ladies of the evening actually are quite expensive but i i literally
[4593.40 --> 4601.08]  cannot speak to that from personal experience i yeah i don't know it would be to be clear not shaming
[4601.08 --> 4608.20]  sex work is work i just want to make that very very clear i just i really should cost a lot i'm married
[4608.20 --> 4617.00]  yeah so i and and i'm not okay i'm not kink shaming if you and your married partner are into it hey cool
[4617.00 --> 4621.96]  oh man how do i back my how do i get myself out of this corner you personally are in a monogamous
[4621.96 --> 4629.40]  relationship yes got it we got him but yeah i don't know for me this would actually be like a
[4629.40 --> 4640.28]  difficult job luke monogamous there are carve outs yeah um yeah this would be a very difficult job
[4640.28 --> 4647.56]  not that that you know no problems there but spending that much money that fast would be would be people
[4647.56 --> 4651.96]  are like throw banging parties fair enough but you're not going to throw a party every day of
[4651.96 --> 4657.48]  the week some people try i think don't they it wasn't that like a wasn't isn't like socialite
[4657.48 --> 4666.84]  culture basically that yeah i mean i guess so i just yacht parties buy a yacht buying a yacht yes
[4666.84 --> 4671.64]  that's a popular one is that an investment you see this not buying supercars is like sort of an
[4671.64 --> 4677.24]  investment yeah especially if they're limited edition that can apparently be a really good investment so is
[4677.24 --> 4682.12]  is buying a yacht an investment does that have that same thing going on i'm not i think yachts
[4682.12 --> 4687.88]  depreciate i have no idea i i honestly don't know you see bezos is having them like tear down a
[4688.60 --> 4694.76]  historic bridge yeah to like float his yacht out to the ocean or something like that we don't actually
[4694.76 --> 4701.88]  know for sure that it's bezos but it's rumored to be bezos say no just just leave it there good luck
[4701.88 --> 4711.88]  hope you like floating in the river oh man yeah invest in meta that's an investment yeah yeah it's
[4711.88 --> 4719.48]  an investment i'm talking actually spending it yeah it's it would be hard it would be legitimately hard
[4719.48 --> 4724.76]  to be fair the scenario where they have to actually spend that amount just doesn't really exist because
[4724.76 --> 4728.36]  what's going to be coming out of that money is your your mortgage or your rent or whatever
[4728.36 --> 4732.76]  um i don't think you have a mortgage if you're paying if you're making a million and a half
[4732.76 --> 4741.96]  dollars a year i mean you could what if your house is 30 million dollars okay that ah see this is where
[4741.96 --> 4750.20]  you and i i feel like have trouble with these kinds of conversations because um i have always and i know
[4750.20 --> 4757.40]  you have always been um a live within my means kind of person when when ivan oh no so i agree if i was
[4757.40 --> 4763.80]  making that much i would not have a mortgage yeah but but i'm sure people do is all i'm yeah i mean
[4763.80 --> 4771.16]  i know there are houses that cost that kind of money it's just i i i no matter i would have to have
[4771.88 --> 4778.12]  30 million dollars in the bank to actually maybe not 30 million because i'm thinking back to when
[4778.12 --> 4782.28]  ivan and i bought our house we were approved for a mortgage that was either double or triple or something
[4782.28 --> 4787.32]  like that what we ultimately spent on our home and that was back 11 years ago or 12 years ago
[4787.32 --> 4795.08]  almost now and we didn't do it because we were just totally uncomfortable with that level of debt
[4795.08 --> 4803.40]  so i guess what it would work out to now because we did 20 down is i would have to have six million down
[4803.40 --> 4809.96]  and i would have to expect to have i would have to expect to be able to pay it off within about five to
[4809.96 --> 4816.20]  seven years five to eight years i think was our goal i think we had wanted we had set the stretch
[4816.20 --> 4822.44]  goal of like uh five assuming that everything went amazing and i like crushed it and actually i don't
[4822.44 --> 4827.00]  even think that was no i don't even think that was a dream yet at the point that we were actually buying
[4827.00 --> 4832.36]  it i think that came later when we were like we should start a company and stuff like that so i'm
[4832.36 --> 4836.60]  trying to i'm trying to think back to the timeline your house yeah you had i think 10 years i think
[4836.60 --> 4843.72]  10 years was mortgage shredding goal with a stretch target of beating it and we were not willing to
[4843.72 --> 4849.00]  take on a mortgage payment that we couldn't comfortably pay double every month so our mortgage was actually
[4849.72 --> 4854.20]  um half of the payments that we made and then we made sure that we had an agreement with the bank
[4854.20 --> 4859.24]  where we could pay twice as much because that second that first payment is almost all interest yeah and
[4859.24 --> 4865.24]  that second payment is all principle the way that are the way that our mortgage worked anyway um
[4867.64 --> 4873.80]  where was i going with this right so even if i made like that that kind of money i i would have to
[4873.80 --> 4878.84]  have i'm not 30 million dollar house i don't see the point how many people would have to live in it
[4879.40 --> 4885.72]  to make any sense like basically small hotels like they're they're insane yeah i i don't know but then
[4885.72 --> 4890.28]  you you hear about these like uh and i know this isn't necessarily the scenario we're talking about
[4890.28 --> 4895.56]  but we're so off topic right now yeah funny so who cares uh but you you constantly hear about sports
[4895.56 --> 4902.84]  stars that just make huge money many million dollar a year contracts like just big big big money and
[4902.84 --> 4908.20]  then they're out they're retired for like two three years and they're broke yeah so like
[4909.88 --> 4914.44]  i don't know i think one of the things is when when you start making that type of money people will try
[4914.44 --> 4922.28]  to float into your life that will you know find ways for you to spend it um that's fair so yeah i
[4922.28 --> 4928.68]  don't know uh people are saying no no they're talking about theoretical 30 million dollar homes oh ladies
[4928.68 --> 4936.76]  and gentlemen we are not talking theoretical homes we are talking we live in vancouver ladies and gentlemen
[4936.76 --> 4948.52]  literally the least affordable city on earth ladies and gentlemen here it is 33 990 got a few more zeros
[4948.52 --> 4958.92]  after that 1233 tecumseh avenue oh yeah nice looking place nice looking place and i ain't talking i ain't
[4958.92 --> 4966.52]  talking some estate here ladies and gentlemen this is probably on like a half acre hold on a second what is it
[4966.52 --> 4977.00]  yeah half acre lot he's nailed it oh lordy it's only a 1200 wait what is this is this a 1200 square foot
[4977.00 --> 4982.52]  house hold on i i've lost track is that a lot oh that's a lot yeah yeah that's a lot sorry there's
[4982.52 --> 4990.52]  an extra zero in here because my current place is uh 2200 and i thought this was less i thought it was
[4990.52 --> 4998.52]  i thought it was 1200 it is 12 000 square feet yeah i i totally i totally derped there uh oh shoot
[4998.52 --> 5003.88]  i just unplugged my headphones for monitoring that oh i need a phone plane chat saying california and vegas
[5003.88 --> 5008.84]  have those 30 million plus dollar homes yeah new york like there's they're definitely around the world
[5010.12 --> 5015.00]  vancouver overall i think we're still in the lead though for most unaffordable city on earth
[5015.00 --> 5021.24]  probably um roughly we don't technically live in vancouver that's a that's always a nice little
[5021.24 --> 5027.40]  thing obviously we feel it out here brutally but it's not quite as bad as it is in vancouver proper
[5027.40 --> 5033.48]  hold on a second i know that like there's some australian sydney oh we're number two we're number
[5033.48 --> 5036.44]  two behind hong kong what is that article from this is from
[5036.44 --> 5045.16]  december 2021 this is this is recent with that said hong kong there's apparently an exodus going
[5045.16 --> 5049.88]  on there right now because of because of the uh crackdowns and everything else so
[5050.60 --> 5057.88]  maybe the situation will change there and we can be back on top yay yeah we're the best at being the
[5057.88 --> 5067.32]  worst sweet yeah um crazy though right yeah i don't remember where we were going with this
[5067.32 --> 5072.84]  buying multiple houses that's a big one and renovations i can speak from experience renovations
[5072.84 --> 5079.32]  can be a really really good way to spend an insane amount of money that you will never get a return on
[5079.32 --> 5085.32]  oh yeah um the builder upgrading your car the builder we were talking to was uh telling us actually i think
[5085.32 --> 5091.00]  it was the ones who did the uh the boiler system were telling us about a place that they did uh i believe
[5091.00 --> 5100.92]  it was up in whistler for an athlete that apparently had on tap beer like plumbed into the house
[5101.96 --> 5110.28]  so not just like in a bar but like there were beer taps like everywhere like if you can dream it
[5110.28 --> 5118.20]  there are boutique home builders that can build it for you yeah and i was like what my uncle has
[5118.20 --> 5124.92]  has done some just absolutely incredible builds um and like they they pride themselves on really high
[5124.92 --> 5129.40]  quality and all this kind of stuff and like i can appreciate the craftsmanship but some of the costs
[5129.40 --> 5135.16]  of the houses and stuff that they build they're just like what the even who how did they even possibly
[5135.16 --> 5143.16]  make this much money like i just oh man i don't know yeah flipped a mattress says how the f do you
[5143.16 --> 5147.80]  keep it cold well remember i did say that the company that was talking about this was the one
[5147.80 --> 5153.96]  that did the boiler system for our uh for our house it's just in floor heat there's no beer taps okay
[5154.60 --> 5159.40]  um so that i'm sure they have experience with heating and cooling and all that kind of stuff isn't that
[5159.40 --> 5166.60]  crazy though that is absolutely nuts oh i love it i love it um apparently one of the uh one of the tech
[5166.60 --> 5174.84]  giant uh executives also has a place up there that has snow melts across like hundreds i think they said
[5174.84 --> 5182.04]  thousands of square feet of outside area so it just has these like banks of boilers that just sit
[5182.04 --> 5189.16]  and burn fuel to keep snow off of the patio and off of the driveway for the like three days a year that
[5189.16 --> 5199.48]  they actually go there like just just mind bending stuff guys mind bending although they spent money
[5200.28 --> 5205.40]  at least they spent at least they spent it on something yeah at least those trades got work
[5205.40 --> 5210.68]  yeah and we're doing stuff yep that's fair enough yep oh no jaden's gone full eat the rich
[5210.68 --> 5221.16]  fair enough but like i've said to david on many occasions here please don't eat me i like to feel
[5221.16 --> 5228.60]  like i'm i haven't gone full filthy capitalist where i actually like work every day for my money okay can
[5228.60 --> 5235.08]  can we can can you get behind that are you gonna eat me uh no i'm good jeff bell you're gonna eat me
[5235.08 --> 5242.76]  he's giving me he's giving me after all the scraps that i let fall off my table for you
[5244.20 --> 5252.12]  i got oh my god i called him jeff instead of jake i always call him bell i totally called him jeff
[5252.92 --> 5258.12]  oh man you're screwed man that was terrible well yeah i don't i don't blame you i mean i had your last
[5258.12 --> 5268.84]  name right jeff jeff oh on that horrible note um thanks for your painstakingly spent all this time
[5268.84 --> 5273.96]  thanks for your hard work jake going through all the merch messages and curating them for us why
[5273.96 --> 5280.52]  don't we why don't we do some of them so you can actually go home at some point here oh man oh no oh
[5280.52 --> 5287.16]  no the chat's full of eat the rich oh no come on guys come on no for real i'm making new investments
[5287.16 --> 5291.72]  into the company we're hiring way more people i swear to you i'm spending that's true labs think
[5291.72 --> 5298.92]  of labs think of ltt labs think of all the new people we're hiring for ltt store oh man yummy linus
[5298.92 --> 5304.68]  burger all right let's uh let's do some merch messages here please spend money don't eat me
[5306.12 --> 5313.56]  i swear it supports so many people uh all right curated ones uh i know running a permanent open air
[5313.56 --> 5317.80]  test bench setup is not commonly recommended but i've been doing it for five years these are coming
[5317.80 --> 5322.28]  in so fast that it completely shifted off my screen i've been doing it five years now without
[5322.28 --> 5327.32]  issues i think besides dust and dander what problems would i look out for airflow no your
[5327.32 --> 5333.00]  airflow will be as good as anything the only the only way you could have bad airflow is if you didn't
[5333.00 --> 5339.56]  really have any fans at all and that that heat pocket is allowed to just kind of sit there
[5339.56 --> 5345.80]  stagnant or anything going on yeah that's so if you're trying to run a passive computer you might
[5345.80 --> 5351.72]  want to don't assume that an open bench means that magically you get magic airflow through it or
[5351.72 --> 5357.88]  something like that you might still need a one slow fan just circulating air in the room that was
[5357.88 --> 5363.48]  something that we saw with the hp omen 45l was that depending on where we put our temp sensors in the
[5363.48 --> 5368.84]  room it actually heats up a pocket near it and that's normal so that's the only thing that i would be
[5368.84 --> 5372.28]  aware of and making sure that you blow it off once in a while that's that's it it's probably
[5372.28 --> 5377.88]  more not recommended because like stuff might fall into a fan or you might spill a drink on it more
[5377.88 --> 5381.32]  easily or whatever yeah but if you put a grill on it something like that it's not a problem i've been
[5381.32 --> 5387.72]  benched my systems for a long time all right nicholas says hey linus and luke i just built my second pc
[5388.52 --> 5395.00]  and i plan to use it as a server slash home theater pc i installed debian and virtualized windows for vr
[5395.00 --> 5402.60]  gaming i don't know if i'd recommend that for the best like low latency experience but if you're
[5402.60 --> 5407.40]  happy with it then i'm happy for you yeah i planned on setting up next cloud for file storage but what
[5407.40 --> 5412.92]  other software improves daily life that you host on your own hardware i mean plex is really the heaviest
[5412.92 --> 5418.28]  one for me i was gonna say plex yeah plex is awesome but it sounds like you're already using it as
[5418.28 --> 5423.64]  a server slash home theater so i'm assuming you thought of plex um one of the other things that
[5423.64 --> 5430.04]  will be running on mine at the new place is home assistant so it's so that's that's whoa i just
[5430.04 --> 5434.28]  lost my headphones that's home automation stuff yes yeah that's direction i was gonna go and it ties
[5434.28 --> 5441.64]  in all the disparate ecosystems that don't otherwise talk to each other it's super cool those i'd say are
[5441.64 --> 5451.08]  are the the pretty big ones for me uh erin a what is your opinion on the 8 gig rx 580 does it still hold
[5451.08 --> 5457.48]  up uh in today's games or should i look into 3060 when they're available well if you've got one you
[5457.48 --> 5462.44]  are the only one who can answer that question because i feel like being compelled to upgrade by
[5462.44 --> 5468.76]  the availability of some new widget is a mistake that's that's meaningless yeah yeah the only times i
[5468.76 --> 5474.84]  usually look towards upgrading my hardware is if there's a if there's an issue with the performance
[5474.84 --> 5479.80]  that i'm getting whether a game that i currently play has updated and has become more difficult to
[5479.80 --> 5485.96]  run exactly or if i'm trying to play a new game and i can't have it run at an acceptable frame rate no
[5485.96 --> 5493.00]  i don't have a disadvantage or yeah i don't expect everything to run at like uh at maximum like 144 hertz
[5493.00 --> 5499.64]  refreshing ultra settings all the time and like as as i keep the same computer as as new games come out
[5499.64 --> 5504.84]  maybe i'll lower my like average settings per game for a little while but then eventually it'll become
[5504.84 --> 5508.76]  at a level where it's unsatisfaction it's nice having a brand new rig and running everything at high but
[5508.76 --> 5513.48]  it's not necessary we did a video about that a while ago about how ultra settings really don't
[5513.48 --> 5520.84]  look very different when you are engaged in the game sure if you pixel peep if you pixel peep you
[5520.84 --> 5525.48]  can find it you can yeah you can find it but you have to be real with yourself about whether or not it
[5525.48 --> 5531.24]  even matters 100 and a lot of times it doesn't really i really really like games where when you're
[5531.24 --> 5537.56]  changing settings there's a little example mm-hmm and it shows like what it will how it will look
[5537.56 --> 5542.60]  different based on that setting change and that yeah i've seen so few like that though oh it's
[5542.60 --> 5547.56]  extremely rare but it's really nice when they do it luke d i'm currently saving to build a new
[5547.56 --> 5551.00]  computer in about a year or so so how do you personally design your system's airflow there's
[5551.00 --> 5555.16]  a lot of overwhelming and conflicting information maybe a job for labs this is absolutely something
[5555.16 --> 5559.16]  we'll investigate with labs but there's two main principles one is that you want a little bit
[5559.16 --> 5563.56]  more air coming in than going out you want to maintain positive pressure inside your system
[5563.56 --> 5569.88]  and you want those intakes to be filtered which remember will affect how much air is drawn through
[5569.88 --> 5574.84]  them so you might need three fans coming in two fans going out and the other is making sure that
[5574.84 --> 5580.20]  you are actually delivering fresh air to the areas that need it so we showed recently in a video how
[5580.20 --> 5586.60]  if we had a big chungus gpu and a fan blowing across it like this but it kind of blocked off the
[5586.60 --> 5592.76]  bottom part of the case and there was no way for the the fans uh for the heatsink of the gpu to get
[5592.76 --> 5597.32]  the air that's going constantly being recirculated back into it out of the case you could end up
[5597.32 --> 5603.00]  with a problem so i would i would just recommend making sure that for every heat generating component
[5603.00 --> 5608.36]  which is predominantly your cpu and your gpu you have a clear path for the air to take in with the
[5608.36 --> 5617.48]  fresh out with the less fresh anonymous says let's hear a random fact that you know about each other
[5618.04 --> 5619.72]  love the content keep it up
[5622.76 --> 5632.12]  i know that luke lived for the better part of two years on nothing but sous vide chicken breast
[5632.92 --> 5633.16]  yeah
[5635.88 --> 5641.24]  yep so we chicken breast rice and broccoli that was the that was the meal yeah
[5642.28 --> 5646.20]  what do you got i know you really like pickles that was the first thing that came to mind
[5646.20 --> 5652.68]  i don't know like i don't know we both went food yeah interesting interesting i think uh yeah it's
[5652.68 --> 5657.88]  6 50 we're both late for dinner it makes sense yeah that that actually makes a lot of sense
[5659.40 --> 5666.92]  um oh and i see what's happening i'm pushing them back up to the okay yeah i need to hit archive
[5666.92 --> 5673.24]  um enusiato says first time ltd store buyer also watching on floatplane for the first time any chance
[5673.24 --> 5679.32]  for motorcycle content in the near future i want to leave that to the folks that are just experts at
[5679.32 --> 5685.88]  it i i love my bike and i ride my bike but i i don't have track experience i don't i don't know about
[5685.88 --> 5690.92]  all the different you know kinds of suspension you can get and tuning and all that kind of stuff so
[5690.92 --> 5696.44]  i feel like with motorcycles i just don't have as much to contribute at least until they get a little
[5696.44 --> 5702.76]  bit more computer on two wheelsy which will happen you know like i i feel like i could review a heads
[5702.76 --> 5709.00]  up display for example but i also feel like in that space a lot of the features that might be built into
[5709.00 --> 5714.60]  a product like that might be very race oriented features so it's hard for me to say there's a lot
[5714.60 --> 5720.92]  of comments about the chicken rice and broccoli things someone said i remember luke from a really
[5720.92 --> 5726.36]  old channel super fun video really just ate an entire head of broccoli yeah i don't know um don't
[5726.36 --> 5733.16]  take diet advice from random tech people on the internet yeah that would be not best so don't
[5733.16 --> 5737.88]  uh don't take any of that as suggestion please let's keep going uh yes ben we are working on a
[5737.88 --> 5744.12]  water bottle lid with a straw mechanism it's a matter of time um grant what do you think about 3d printed
[5744.12 --> 5750.28]  residential and commercial construction for example extruded concrete sounds so cool definitely a lot of
[5750.28 --> 5755.16]  logistical issues to solve because when you're talking construction like this didn't even occur to me
[5755.16 --> 5764.36]  but intel this video is not up yet there's a lot of potential issues but i think i think the tech is
[5764.36 --> 5769.08]  super super cool and i think a lot of construction is going to go in that direction eventually i think
[5769.08 --> 5774.84]  there's still a lot of hurdles to solve because right now um like okay use it for foundation or whatever
[5774.84 --> 5780.36]  i've seen examples where they essentially print the whole darn house like walls and everything and
[5780.36 --> 5787.16]  that's sweet wiring and stuff becomes really right interesting um and they they like pre-lay things
[5787.16 --> 5791.96]  for windows and all this kind of stuff but it's there are unique complications with that construction
[5791.96 --> 5796.60]  style i'm sure there's people that know significantly more about it than me um but maybe look into it and
[5796.60 --> 5802.04]  i'm sure there's a lot more like r d that needs to happen with it um but automation is
[5803.80 --> 5808.28]  is a big deal and it's going to come to every industry including that one um and i think that's one of the
[5808.28 --> 5813.56]  the ways that it's going to come to construction i had an email from valve and i was like we didn't
[5813.56 --> 5819.40]  do anything bad when we showed the steam deck that we know it's all good that's good telling me about
[5819.40 --> 5828.68]  some stuff i said nothing trust me um kernel says do you think a new mainstream cpu manufacturer will
[5828.68 --> 5838.60]  even be possible well apple i would have said no and then apple did it i consider apple sort of a
[5838.60 --> 5844.68]  manufacturer yes that they're made by tsmc or samsung or whatever but they are they top to bottom have
[5845.32 --> 5853.40]  not quite top to bottom okay it's arm based but they they have they have made a new cpu essentially um
[5853.40 --> 5857.80]  and i would have said that couldn't be done but then they did it and then you've got amazon with their
[5857.80 --> 5863.40]  graviton or whatever they call it but that's not mainstream apple i would argue is mainstream
[5864.20 --> 5872.84]  man hard to say i'm rooting for risk 5 but there's just so much legacy x86 code out there that we still
[5872.84 --> 5878.12]  got to run but then apple showed it might be possible to emulate in a in a performant way
[5879.64 --> 5883.88]  i i'm afraid to i'm afraid to even try to look into my crystal ball on that one to be honest with you
[5883.88 --> 5890.84]  uh justin asks have you seen the corridor with digital website and have you ever thought to
[5890.84 --> 5894.44]  implement anything like their point system into float plane that way subscribers could choose what
[5894.44 --> 5899.72]  content or products their sub money gets allocated to so the reason that we haven't done anything like
[5899.72 --> 5906.52]  that is because i um i i'm a control freak i like to maintain control of our editorial direction i like
[5906.52 --> 5912.36]  the writing team to come up with what we want to do and as much as we you know love to hear from you
[5912.36 --> 5919.32]  guys and we take comments and suggestions i don't want to be beholden to you guys it's also much
[5919.32 --> 5924.36]  different content yeah i don't want people to feel ripped off because we didn't cover the product that
[5924.36 --> 5928.12]  they want us to this like motherboard they really wanted us to review well to be fair this isn't a
[5928.12 --> 5934.12]  suggestion box it's a voting thing yeah so you would come up with the topics yeah but what if one what if
[5934.12 --> 5937.96]  one of them was an a and the rest of them were kind of b's and i was really hoping they voted for
[5937.96 --> 5945.16]  the a like i just yeah it's tough i don't think we're going to be doing that anytime soon uh evelyn
[5945.16 --> 5949.08]  are you expecting the price of steam deck competitors to come down significantly when the deck releases
[5949.08 --> 5956.76]  like the ionio for example no i'm not no no the steam deck is inexpensive because valve it went really
[5956.76 --> 5963.56]  aggressive hyper aggressive on it that's the answer man the people who are complaining about the steam deck
[5963.56 --> 5968.92]  price when it launched i'm like guys this is a laptop with a game controller built into it you and
[5968.92 --> 5975.72]  i both massively went in on how how cheap it was actually yes and i i still back that up very much
[5975.72 --> 5982.20]  so joshua says hey luke i've heard you and linus talk about how frugal you can be frugal's such a nice
[5982.76 --> 5990.12]  soft word for it is there any kind of technology or whatever that you like to splurge on yeah i mean i i
[5990.12 --> 5998.44]  instantly bought the steam deck oh okay um and vr i had i had basically i had i think literally
[5998.44 --> 6006.76]  every single oculus prototype you could acquire for me it's yeah it's just gaming gaming pcs that's
[6006.76 --> 6013.24]  that's kind of it i oh oh oh headphones headphones are a guilty pleasure time you bought a gaming pc
[6013.24 --> 6019.32]  well i'm talking about when i spent money okay yeah yeah but okay so yeah my computer but i have
[6019.32 --> 6027.48]  literally never purchased a cell phone not once i got my first cell phone from my parents
[6028.04 --> 6034.60]  and then when it died i inherited one from my then girlfriend who had gotten a new one and then when i
[6034.60 --> 6042.68]  went to work at ncix they issued me a blackberry then my contract uh allowed for uh like a and i gave
[6042.68 --> 6048.84]  me an allowance for a new phone and ncix purchased me an iphone 4 which by the time i left ncix was
[6048.84 --> 6056.04]  irrelevant and they didn't care to have it back and then after that htc sent me a windows phone
[6056.04 --> 6060.84]  which i then did an i switched thing to i took my sim out of my iphone i put it into my windows phone
[6060.84 --> 6066.44]  and we got into reviewing phones and the rest is history we now have a bin of phones so i would not
[6066.44 --> 6071.24]  buy a phone today yeah i have never purchased a cell phone i have never purchased a television
[6071.24 --> 6077.64]  so those are things that i'd certainly enjoy but are not ones that i have allocated my personal
[6077.64 --> 6084.12]  funding to but i did blow a bunch of money on a receiver and nice speakers i did blow a bunch of
[6084.12 --> 6090.68]  money on expensive headphones back in the day i would still do that i'm considering treating myself to
[6090.68 --> 6099.08]  a pair of sennheiser iems um i'm just i'm airpods pros are nice but they just don't sound the same
[6100.28 --> 6106.92]  yeah a lot of my stuff like back when i used to have to buy it my computer was always good it was
[6107.96 --> 6114.60]  it was never like crazy i never i never went way too nuts but it was it was always good i almost always
[6114.60 --> 6119.96]  bought secondhand even when i did splurge yeah i would i would do things like the intel retail edge stuff
[6119.96 --> 6126.04]  i would i would do things like um hey i'll build your computer for you but i mean we're gonna throw
[6126.04 --> 6131.24]  in like a couple extra fans i'm gonna take those um yeah or whatever thanks for the fans yeah i would
[6131.24 --> 6136.92]  like build people's computers or whatever in order to gain some extra part or if they had something cool
[6136.92 --> 6141.96]  in their previous one or something i would take that or whatever um obviously they knew every time yes
[6141.96 --> 6151.00]  obviously um outside of that um experiences i guess is is my other technology no but they didn't ask for
[6151.00 --> 6155.32]  that yeah they did is there any other kind of technology or whatever oh oh sure sure sure yeah
[6155.32 --> 6163.32]  okay yeah experiences is definitely a thing um like something i really enjoyed doing in taiwan was this like
[6164.12 --> 6170.20]  craze called river tracing yeah um and i had to i had to essentially hire a guide for the whole day to go with
[6170.20 --> 6179.40]  me and i i hiked up a river up a mountain essentially in the river it was super cool um and when we were
[6179.40 --> 6185.88]  when we went on the company trip to mexico i like did some of my own excursion things in addition to the
[6185.88 --> 6193.80]  company ones um i love that type of stuff i'm super into that yeah thoughts on high-end portable audio
[6193.80 --> 6201.56]  players gotta say i'm not uh i don't get it for me the phone is good enough and sure yeah fine the the
[6202.44 --> 6210.76]  DAC sucks and whatever else but um for me we've it's at that point of diminishing returns um especially
[6210.76 --> 6218.84]  for the amount of attention that i'm giving it when i'm listening on my phone i i mean in my life i don't
[6218.84 --> 6226.44]  have time to sit and listen to music almost always i'm doing something else i'm playing a game or i'm
[6226.44 --> 6233.56]  writing a script or i like i'm always doing something and so for the amount of attention
[6233.56 --> 6241.96]  that i'm giving it it just doesn't make a difference for me uh okay hey linus after the vault recovery
[6241.96 --> 6246.68]  series is over would you guys make a proper tutorial on how to set up true naz with raid z2 and multiple v devs
[6246.68 --> 6250.76]  for beginners who have multiple hard drives lying around uh yeah honestly if you just have multiple
[6250.76 --> 6254.60]  hard drives lying around though you may want to consider unraid instead the performance is not the
[6254.60 --> 6261.16]  same as true naz but it's way more flexible and for home use it makes a ton of sense like even though
[6261.16 --> 6267.32]  jake and i are super into uh true naz and like higher end stuff at work both of us run unraid at home
[6267.32 --> 6272.76]  because it's just so much easier to expand your storage you just put in a drive you don't have to add a
[6272.76 --> 6277.32]  whole additional v dev of drives the consumers don't buy stuff like that or at least they don't
[6277.32 --> 6288.76]  want to right um matthew asks uh lovesack section couch with stealth tech review when no one on youtube
[6288.76 --> 6292.44]  has a review of this yet it's a modular sectional couch with built-in speakers i think we actually
[6292.44 --> 6299.48]  reached out to them asking for a review unit and then um basically we have a policy that we will not
[6299.48 --> 6304.60]  trade coverage for product you're welcome to send us a product but we're not promising anything
[6304.60 --> 6311.16]  because as soon as we trade coverage for product there are um tax and conflict of interest issues
[6311.16 --> 6316.36]  so we like to be up front we're like hey look you're we are interested is what we'll say we're
[6316.36 --> 6322.04]  interested in reviewing this and we would like to review it but we don't promise anything because
[6322.68 --> 6326.04]  uh i don't want to be stuck making a video about something that is like
[6326.04 --> 6331.48]  bad but not bad in an entertaining way like just bad but uninteresting it's just boring like i don't
[6331.48 --> 6340.04]  want to make boring videos right so um we basically said no and then i forget if it ever came back up
[6340.04 --> 6345.96]  again but i think my intention was to just buy one but we have not dealt with that so it's it's on our
[6345.96 --> 6352.44]  radar but we haven't gotten around to it yet um james y asks what type of metal are the screwdriver bits
[6352.44 --> 6356.84]  going to be oh uh okay do you want to do a couple of other super chats while i run and grab we've
[6356.84 --> 6366.60]  actually got packaging for the bit clips yep uh i don't know about that one moving forward
[6369.56 --> 6373.96]  storage server stuff lines will probably want to respond to that i have no idea who this is
[6373.96 --> 6382.92]  uh i'll address it anyways have you guys heard of zam zaluf i actually think i have but i think it's
[6382.92 --> 6388.52]  not pronounced that way and i think i've heard it um he's a 22 year old dude who manufactures actual
[6388.52 --> 6394.76]  semiconductor chips in his jaw in his garage uh using now vintage equipment his last chip has
[6394.76 --> 6400.52]  1000 plus transistors wow that's crazy possibly cool video he seems like a pretty interesting guy
[6400.52 --> 6411.56]  i love the show that's cool that's sweet uh you have featured products that would be a great benefit
[6411.56 --> 6417.56]  to people who are blind uh the webcam with ai for example could the lab please test the accessibility
[6417.56 --> 6424.52]  of the apps and product um you have to own before you find out they aren't um
[6424.52 --> 6430.36]  uh that could be and it's the what the lab is going to do and how it's going to do it and all
[6430.36 --> 6438.20]  that kind of stuff is still so nebulous and up in the air um i would make sure that you bring that up
[6438.20 --> 6442.76]  again i'm not telling you to make another merch message if there isn't something that you want to
[6442.76 --> 6447.80]  buy but you could tweet us or if there is something you want to buy yeah do another rich message i'd bring
[6447.80 --> 6454.60]  that up again once the lab has people that have been hired for it um because at this time no one
[6454.60 --> 6459.88]  has been hired for the lab there is nothing actually happening yet um people are going to be hired a lot
[6459.88 --> 6464.84]  of the hiring for the lab is in its final stages are getting close to it but it's not there yet so make
[6464.84 --> 6470.76]  sure you bring it up again later oh and there's no guarantee that if you haven't heard back that we
[6470.76 --> 6476.28]  won't reach out we just haven't finalized how many positions we're hiring yeah um but a lot of the
[6476.28 --> 6481.80]  ones that we do know we're hiring are quite uh quite far in yeah did this get unplugged oh how'd
[6481.80 --> 6487.88]  that happen whoops uh okay so i thought it said on the packaging um what they were made of but it
[6487.88 --> 6496.20]  actually just says uh blah blah blah 20 millimeter so it doesn't come in the screwdriver it just comes
[6496.20 --> 6503.08]  in its own little box yes you put it in yourself because basically the labor cost of doing it that way
[6503.08 --> 6508.44]  was like really high and we were like this doesn't make any sense i mean i'd because yeah who cares
[6508.44 --> 6513.40]  we expect a lot of people to build out their own bit load anyway so at launch we're going to try and
[6513.40 --> 6522.20]  have all of these available which are additional bit uh like bit sets so we'll have ones that mirror the
[6522.20 --> 6527.40]  uh the shipping one the one that it comes with in case you just want more of them and then we'll have
[6527.40 --> 6533.72]  ones that are basically tuned for everything so we'll have a philip set which has two philip zeros
[6533.72 --> 6540.68]  can i open this yeah four philips ones four philips twos and two philips threes just in case you want to
[6540.68 --> 6546.12]  have extra philipses we'll have a metric hex set that'll have everything from 1.5 all the way to six
[6546.12 --> 6554.44]  we'll have an imperial hex set that goes from 0.05 to quarter inch uh we'll have a torx security torx set
[6554.44 --> 6563.16]  that is t3 t4 t5 t6 7 8 9 10 15 20 25 and 30 and then we'll have the fu set which we're calling the
[6563.16 --> 6570.52]  specialty set which is basically when manufacturers say fu and it'll have things like tri-wing pentalobe
[6570.52 --> 6579.08]  um super super tiny philipses so uh y 000 y 00 y y1 y2 actually that's not philips is it it's something
[6579.08 --> 6583.72]  else is that like positive drive or something i can't remember what that one is what is why oh no it oh
[6583.72 --> 6588.52]  oh why is try why is that tri-wing if i recall correctly yep uh and then it'll also have that
[6588.52 --> 6595.88]  weird like spanner bit um so these will all be available for like pretty pretty reasonable prices
[6595.88 --> 6601.40]  at launch but all it says is black phosphate finish unfortunately it's not actually on the package and i
[6601.40 --> 6610.84]  don't remember but i told kyle to get the best one so hopefully it's the best one he went all engineering
[6610.84 --> 6616.28]  on the answer to me and he was like um actually there isn't a best metal to make bits out of
[6616.28 --> 6622.76]  because there are trade-offs between malleability different things and uh are like like uh rigidity
[6622.76 --> 6629.64]  and uh like uh shatter proneness and this stuff like that and i'm just like okay that's that's fair
[6629.64 --> 6638.20]  enough but i want the best one for the the what we're doing he's like okay uh someone asked and i
[6638.20 --> 6642.36]  accidentally click archive but i remember what it was um how's the how's the house coming along
[6644.28 --> 6651.56]  you keep getting unplugged i know right dang it house is coming good not great uh we're hoping to
[6651.56 --> 6657.96]  be moved in soonish uh there's an update video coming so it's actually shot and edited already so
[6657.96 --> 6664.44]  it should be coming really soon and uh basically we we caught them the day before they started putting up
[6664.44 --> 6671.56]  drywall so it's kind of oh yeah it's a tour of behind the drywall all the tech that we've built
[6671.56 --> 6677.00]  into the house over the last few months i'm really really excited to show you guys that it's my it's
[6677.00 --> 6683.32]  my dream tech house there's just no other way to put it uh will there ever be something on product
[6683.32 --> 6690.36]  pages that names the designer or designers uh main planner or planners of a product i would love to see
[6690.36 --> 6697.16]  who has who has had their hand in doing which products interesting um that's not something that
[6697.16 --> 6703.88]  we had planned but something that you can do if you want to get insight into that is subscribe to the
[6703.88 --> 6710.76]  newsletter newsletter uh we actually had one that went out today uh happy 2022 y'all um nick put this
[6710.76 --> 6715.88]  together we had a busy start to the year lots that's why we haven't sent any out this year uh if you
[6715.88 --> 6720.28]  haven't seen the recent ltt videos featuring our new cable tester they're recommended but not required
[6720.28 --> 6725.56]  to boost your understanding of some of the concepts outlined in this update because kyle put together a
[6726.60 --> 6736.84]  sick like absolutely awesome little lesson for you guys about how crap usbc cables are and why check
[6736.84 --> 6742.36]  this out so this is the kind of this is the kind of stuff that like a good engineer can do if you
[6742.36 --> 6749.00]  actually give them time so he's going he's disassembling the cables finding um let's have a
[6749.00 --> 6754.76]  look here but about this is probably a really long one he actually gave me the this in person uh when we
[6754.76 --> 6760.12]  had our merch meeting on uh tuesday morning shielded differential pair yeah all of them failed our signal
[6760.12 --> 6768.12]  integrity testing uh here we go so this is really important shielding is not wireless it's like putting
[6768.12 --> 6774.12]  on an ungrounded esd band and expecting the static to be magically absorbed because the cables that we
[6774.12 --> 6779.56]  got out they have shielding you can see the the shielding wrapped around these uh differential pairs
[6779.56 --> 6785.16]  here or signal pairs or whatever you want i think they're differential pairs look i'm not an engineer
[6785.16 --> 6792.20]  my lingo might not be quite right but the the shielding here it's not grounded to anything yeah so
[6792.20 --> 6798.44]  it's just it's just sitting there it doesn't do anything amazing right uh so he shows what it
[6798.44 --> 6805.40]  looks like when one is actually grounded correctly which is super cool uh explains how there needs to
[6805.40 --> 6811.64]  be a third conductor in with the twisted pairs uh it's almost like following the spec actually makes
[6811.64 --> 6818.44]  a cable work haha whoo could he make the bad cables work this is not something i would have necessarily
[6818.44 --> 6824.84]  told him to spend time on but he did um so he tried to take the the not properly shielded ones and ground
[6824.84 --> 6831.32]  the shield to see if they'd get any better no they still failed um so we're we are hard at work on our
[6831.32 --> 6837.64]  cables i promise you that when we launch them they will be awesome and if you guys want to know more
[6837.64 --> 6840.92]  about the behind the scenes of what's going on at creator warehouse you're definitely going to want
[6840.92 --> 6846.12]  to sign up for the newsletter because you can expect more educational stuff like that it's not just
[6846.12 --> 6850.44]  about selling you stuff yeah we're going to want to let you know when there's something new for you
[6850.44 --> 6857.88]  to buy because like that's how we survive but uh we also want to make sure that it's another content
[6857.88 --> 6863.72]  stream for us so uh make sure make sure you go uh iceberg says hey there's still no archive available
[6863.72 --> 6869.40]  for the newsletters which for really cool ones like this there really should be it's coming oh tynan's
[6869.40 --> 6874.76]  in the float plane chat hey thanks tynan it is s2 tool steel with a black phosphate coating oh
[6876.12 --> 6881.40]  didn't even occur to me to message tynan or uh kyle because it's like after hours but hey if tynan's
[6881.40 --> 6886.12]  going to be in the chat answering questions might as well so tynan is one of our other engineers in
[6886.12 --> 6894.84]  creator warehouse it's also super cool also has improved in badminton a lot in the last year and i
[6894.84 --> 6899.72]  haven't you've improved a little well i haven't been there well not lately but you still improved a little
[6899.72 --> 6904.84]  before you stopped coming yeah i want to go back my shoulder's just been messed up for people that don't have
[6904.84 --> 6912.36]  context there uh are we going to test the steam deck running windows uh oh of course okay yeah
[6912.36 --> 6915.32]  yeah of course i just yeah wasn't 100 sure
[6918.68 --> 6921.64]  okay that's the general one i'm checking the incoming by the way if you want to keep going
[6921.64 --> 6926.28]  through curated yeah i was just having a look at some of the topics that we like didn't cover today
[6927.08 --> 6932.04]  oh uh maybe we'll just push them to next week or something i gotta know where to be i don't know i was
[6932.04 --> 6936.36]  just no no i don't i don't want to i don't want to cover them let's do it when show till midnight
[6936.36 --> 6943.80]  no let's go no um also when the lab is up and running will you be evaluating your own products
[6943.80 --> 6947.24]  to see how they hold up and also publishing those results that's not the first time we've had that
[6947.24 --> 6954.04]  request i think i forgot to ask you about that um i don't see why not i would think we'd have to but
[6954.04 --> 6961.32]  the thing is that they would be collaborating in the early stages like we would use the lab to internally
[6961.32 --> 6965.32]  validate things i guess and you'd probably see that type of stuff in the newsletter and whatnot so
[6965.32 --> 6970.76]  like it might not be in the exact same way that other products are i mean if it's something that we
[6970.76 --> 6979.80]  if it's a tech product that we ultimately release then yeah yeah why not right like we obviously it
[6979.80 --> 6984.60]  would be to our benefit to have our product in the database right it's like almost more advertising at
[6984.60 --> 6991.32]  that point yeah yeah i'm super i'm super down tristan first time making wanshow all this talk
[6991.32 --> 6996.04]  on motherboards has me wondering what's your oh my goodness they're still coming in so fast what's
[6996.04 --> 7000.12]  your recommendation for motherboard brands i've had bad experiences with gigabyte and i want to move away
[7000.12 --> 7005.00]  from them in my next build frankly i've had bad experiences with every single major brand all of them
[7005.00 --> 7014.52]  all of them what you my the best motherboard buying advice that i can give you is buy the most popular
[7014.52 --> 7022.04]  model okay the most popular model that is somewhere in the neighborhood of like four and a half to five
[7022.04 --> 7029.96]  stars because odds are that compared to really low-end stuff which never gets any love and really high-end
[7029.96 --> 7036.60]  stuff that they don't sell enough of to justify paying attention to that mid-range mid to high-end
[7036.60 --> 7041.48]  is where you get the real r d effort put in and where you are more likely to get better long-term
[7041.48 --> 7045.72]  support that's all i can really tell you because we we've had experience of this too when you go on
[7045.72 --> 7051.72]  the ultra high-end uh no one owns it so you're gonna be the only one that runs into certain problems
[7051.72 --> 7057.32]  then there's no fixes for it and it's like what so we're gonna piss off like 800 people
[7057.32 --> 7063.80]  yeah you know when you're a company at that kind of scale for almost any of them really yeah i've
[7063.80 --> 7070.68]  seen it i've seen it uh there's a there's a question here asking if we think we will ever sell our own
[7071.24 --> 7077.32]  mice or keyboards uh absolutely that's something that we would want to explore i think that for us
[7077.32 --> 7083.08]  the big question has to be what are we contributing what are we adding right because
[7083.08 --> 7088.52]  let's take a mouse for example are we going to be able to go toe-to-toe with logitech for cost
[7089.72 --> 7097.08]  no obviously not are we going to be able to go up against razer for branding no come on right are we
[7097.08 --> 7106.44]  going to go and sponsor esports teams like like uh hyper x no no right so we have to figure out what is
[7106.44 --> 7113.24]  our place and then we have to figure out if we can actually build something that matches what we
[7113.24 --> 7118.92]  imagine our place to be so those are those are big questions that you have to have the answers to
[7118.92 --> 7124.36]  before you can undertake a project like that sean says from new zealand i've recently built a storage
[7124.36 --> 7127.72]  server running on read to consolidate a number of hard drives that have a lot of duplicate files
[7128.60 --> 7132.52]  can you recommend any tools to help sort through duplicate files i've actually looked for this not
[7132.52 --> 7137.80]  that long ago i was trying to get rid of duplicate photos i wanted something like the old canon zoom
[7137.80 --> 7144.60]  browser software but modern and like just to deduplicate things and i didn't find anything
[7144.60 --> 7150.68]  good i found a couple open source ones but my library was so enormous that they just weren't able to
[7150.68 --> 7156.28]  handle it in a reasonable amount of time and i got distracted because i had other things to do and i gave up
[7156.28 --> 7162.12]  so that's where i'm at on that um maybe maybe the chat we'll have some ideas there's stuff out there but
[7162.12 --> 7168.44]  i haven't used anything in forever i wouldn't know of a particular recommendation uh dupe guru is
[7168.44 --> 7177.96]  recommended by full the mattress so be careful yeah uh it could be terrible though it could be adware
[7177.96 --> 7186.04]  for all i know so i'm not recommending anything sorry alexandra says alexander uh very excited about
[7186.04 --> 7190.68]  the lab any plans covering the privacy aspect of different devices when analyzing them in the lab
[7190.68 --> 7196.44]  for example when comparing phones vr headsets set top boxes smart watches etc that's a difficult thing
[7196.44 --> 7200.68]  for us to tackle now it's something that we want to consider in the future something we've talked
[7200.68 --> 7207.08]  about for example is the percentage of your tv home screen that is taken up by ads it's like it's a
[7207.08 --> 7211.88]  simple benchmark right but it's i think it's a meaningful one in regards to privacy stuff too there's
[7211.88 --> 7217.24]  maybe some stuff that the the software engineer that works in the labs department could do to
[7217.80 --> 7225.24]  uh try to monitor things like homo uh like various internet of things devices that are around your
[7225.24 --> 7230.36]  house yeah what type of calls they're making out to the internet for sure um it could be something
[7230.36 --> 7237.08]  interesting to to check for uh paul's asks uh do you plan on doing more videos on non-terrestrial isps
[7237.08 --> 7241.56]  uh similar to the starlink video i know a lot of people are still without high speed internet or an internet
[7241.56 --> 7246.28]  connection in general it's something we're very interested in but it's something that is not
[7246.28 --> 7252.60]  always trivial to get your hands on and then get rid of in a timely manner like starlink was super easy
[7252.60 --> 7257.00]  we just ordered it set it up said hey we don't want it anymore and shipped it back they have like
[7257.00 --> 7261.32]  starlink pro or whatever is coming it's way faster oh really i haven't seen that yet i don't really know
[7261.32 --> 7268.28]  a lot of details but uh darren says it's my 22nd birthday today hey happy birthday darren um for luke and
[7268.28 --> 7272.36]  linus i'm in penetration testing class and was wondering how ltt and floatplane handle testing
[7272.36 --> 7275.88]  their platforms do you do internal testing only or do you hire up for verification what a good
[7275.88 --> 7280.76]  question luke what do we do internal testing internal hiring out for verification is a very good idea
[7281.32 --> 7287.64]  it can also be extremely expensive um it's it's not something that i would recommend against but you
[7287.64 --> 7292.28]  do have to consider your your company size and and the type of money that you can spend on that type of
[7292.28 --> 7299.40]  stuff um and the type of data and whatnot that you're dealing with right like if you're if you're
[7299.40 --> 7304.68]  a a law firm website that actually deals with important documents through the platform for some
[7304.68 --> 7311.40]  reason like yeah you should have internal and external uh looking at looking at your service making
[7311.40 --> 7316.84]  sure it's really secure um but yeah we we just do internal at this time i'm not saying it'll be that way
[7316.84 --> 7325.16]  forever um and actually luckily we have a very good and positive community um that has poked around
[7325.16 --> 7329.64]  and sent us stuff to our like support channels and be like hey this thing is maybe not great for
[7329.64 --> 7336.92]  whatever reason and we we look into that so we don't pay for external um but but thanks bros but
[7336.92 --> 7343.96]  thanks bros bros and gals and everything in between yeah bastion says i'm making a studio desk with a
[7343.96 --> 7348.20]  rack mount pc do you have any advice about rack mount cases on the market oh man most of them are
[7348.20 --> 7353.72]  just terrible for a desktop pc that was why i ultimately built my own for my water cooled system
[7354.52 --> 7361.24]  um unfortunately i just haven't looked into it for a long time um and bastion also asks luke when you
[7361.24 --> 7368.76]  code what kind of music helps you get in the zone mine is warcraft 2 or jazz coffee shops uh jazz coffee
[7368.76 --> 7376.12]  shops is a pretty standard one um that i've used for a long time uh you mentioned warcraft 2 kelefin
[7377.72 --> 7384.36]  yeah okay that's been one that i've used since i was like 14 kelefin rubin says i started watching
[7384.36 --> 7388.52]  when i was pretty green in it i am now the endpoint architect for a large healthcare provider nice
[7388.52 --> 7392.60]  thanks for helping me stay inspired and entertained through the journey love seeing ltt grow hey thanks so
[7392.60 --> 7399.16]  much ruben heck yeah and final merch message for the night car right will there ever be something on
[7399.16 --> 7402.52]  the product pages that names the design oh we already did that one oh we already talked about
[7402.52 --> 7407.88]  that just didn't press archive okay see you later uh oh wait here we go anonymous says can you post a
[7407.88 --> 7414.44]  list of all the tech in your new house and how much it costs as a fellow one percenter i want to deck out
