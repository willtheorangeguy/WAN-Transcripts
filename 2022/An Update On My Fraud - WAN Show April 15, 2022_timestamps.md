[2022-04-16T10:04:14Z] Video: An Update On My Fraud - WAN Show April 15, 2022 
A few years ago I (temporarily) lost about US$2500 to credit card fraud here in Sweden. The bank did cover the loss under fraud prevention, so I got the money back, but I also had to file a police report.
The police accepted my report and prompty closed the case with the explanation (and I'm quoting them here) "It is obviously impossible to investigate this crime."
From what I could tell from the card statement, someone had used a cloned/fake card with my card number on it in a store, meaning there would be timestamps, possibly camera footage and witnesses. And it seems likely I wasn't the only one affected. Yeah, sure, obviously impossible to even attempt an investigation there. Police were utterly useless.
