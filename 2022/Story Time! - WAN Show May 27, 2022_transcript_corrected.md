[0.00 → 6.36] welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[6.36 → 15.64] some big topics AMD is launching their dozen 7000 CPUs this fall, and you know what okay Luke I'm
[15.64 → 21.12] going to give you the good topics for a change because you complained, and it was very complaining
[21.12 → 26.66] so i don't want to i don't want i don't want you to feel complaining bring it up one time in 10
[26.66 → 34.28] years, and it's very complaining anyway i fix it starts selling steam deck parts calls out consoles
[34.28 → 41.78] get wrecked consoles um and twitter find 150 million dollars for misusing 2fa data 150 million
[41.78 → 49.26] also i will be explaining my incendiary tweet yesterday i had a very negative experience with
[49.26 → 56.24] one jazz comaker of smart home accessories so I'll be talking i mean really i guess I'll be catching
[56.24 → 62.88] you up Luke on what exactly happened there and why I'm a lot more angry than just if i bought a
[62.88 → 68.72] product, and it didn't work as i expected that's right wow it's going to be a heck of a show today guys
[68.72 → 73.60] I'm going to try really hard not to have any of it be a hot take though okay it's all going to be very
[73.60 → 79.62] reasonable and grounded so you have don't you have literally a topic that is a hot take uh yes i guess
[79.62 → 84.90] it comes down to what a hot take is but yeah, yeah maybe a legitimate complaint isn't a hot take
[84.90 → 88.26] exactly good yeah, and you know what else isn't the intro boom
[88.26 → 117.10] show is brought to you today by vulture axiom and secret labs all right why don't we jump right
[117.10 → 122.06] into our headline topic today i don't remember what it is what did we put in the title
[123.74 → 134.30] uh you're ten thousand dollars ah yes okay Luke here's the problem yes when i set out to smartly
[134.30 → 140.86] my house honestly i don't even know why i did it it was partly morbid curiosity because i think
[140.86 → 146.22] you and i have talked about this fairly extensively in the past I'm not that huge into the home automation
[146.22 → 154.38] thing i have never been i am a young able-bodied young man and i don't mind getting up and pressing
[154.38 → 159.58] a light switch and that's always really the way that i felt about it but yeah i figured okay we're
[159.58 → 164.78] moving into this new place we're ripping off a ton of the drywall anyway i don't know if I've told this
[164.78 → 170.78] story publicly, but we found this um shoot you would your dad would know for sure, but there's a there's a
[170.78 → 177.34] kind of there's a kind of in wall uh plumbing piping that's really terrible, but that was used extensively
[177.34 → 183.58] in the 90s oh yeah he's he's for sure told me but I'm not going to remember the name basically you find it
[183.58 → 188.94] in your house you rip it out you replace it there's no other way to go about it because it's not a matter
[188.94 → 194.46] of if it will fail it's a matter of when it will fail so we ended up peeling back a lot more of the
[194.46 → 199.42] drywall and a lot more of the ceilings than we had originally intended because Polly b Polly b thank you
[199.42 → 204.70] twitch chat oh there we go because we had to pull all of that stuff out of the house and there's
[204.70 → 213.42] bathrooms everywhere so once that was done i kind of went well shoot this was originally built back in
[213.42 → 221.74] the mid 90s it is now the early 2020s by the time I'm done with it is will be i don't know the 2040s the
[221.74 → 229.02] 2050s the 2060s god willing when it comes to resell this place if it is not wired up for
[229.02 → 234.06] smart home a smart home is just going to be a home by that point if things keep going according
[234.06 → 239.18] to the trajectory they're on right now so this is the opportunity to put this stuff in and do it in
[239.18 → 244.70] a way that is clean and professional instead of just you know little nail on cable management
[244.70 → 252.62] things all over the house so fine let's go ahead let's freaking let's wire it up then and part of
[252.62 → 259.42] that was figuring out light switches now there's a wide variety of different smart light switches
[259.42 → 267.42] and they all come with some kind of terrible deal-breaking problem pretty much whether it's
[267.42 → 274.14] the outrageous cost or the super closed ecosystem in some cases i mean inst eon that's the one that
[274.14 → 280.22] shut down outright right that gives you an example of how bad it can be if there's a hyper-closed
[280.22 → 287.42] ecosystem associated with this particular light switch uh Luton i tried so hard i tried so hard
[287.42 → 292.94] to like their switches i bought a ca seta i don't even know how to pronounce it but i bought one of
[292.94 → 296.78] their switches a while back i installed their stupid little hub that you need with it
[298.86 → 307.18] and the second i walked into the room and wanted to use it manually i was like nope pulled it out no
[307.18 → 314.54] tactile feedback on it whatsoever and the switches themselves are like like like pennies bad not tens
[314.54 → 321.26] of pennies bad like it felt like it felt like pushing down on like rotting food or something
[321.26 → 329.42] like it had no it had no like click whatsoever uh yeah we've got we've got the chat talking about
[329.42 → 334.70] this like yeah i get it i get it from uh from a smart control standpoint they might be all right anyway
[334.70 → 341.26] i came across this one from GE or so i thought i will get more into that later i came across this
[341.26 → 347.26] one from get hat i really liked okay it has you know if you're reaching around a corner given you
[347.26 → 352.86] know given the room they'll reach around its easy to tell which part of the button is up which part is
[352.86 → 358.54] down it works like a dimmer switch i would how i would expect it to work you press and hold for dim up
[358.54 → 364.78] press and hold to go down you know I'm an I'm a 90s boy had my CD Walkman all right you press and hold
[364.78 → 371.10] track skip to fast-forward instead all right so it was intuitive to control for me and what i really
[371.10 → 378.14] liked about it was that every single switch for a nominal increase in cost has a motion sensor in it
[378.78 → 384.78] what's cool about that is that while motion sensing is not a perfect way to handle presence detection
[384.78 → 391.26] it certainly is an additional data point and if you've got these motion sensors all over
[391.26 → 397.90] your house well all of a sudden you've got a really cool bit of data to throw at what we're probably
[397.90 → 402.86] gonna we're probably going to add to it with cameras, but you've got a really cool data point to add to
[402.86 → 408.94] presence detection which can save you a freaking ton of money especially in the summer months when you
[408.94 → 414.86] don't need to be running air conditioning in rooms where there are no people that's the main concern
[414.86 → 419.98] is how can we make this place more efficient because if i blow five or ten i think it's somewhere
[419.98 → 424.86] between five and ten thousand dollars i spent on these freaking light switches but if i blow that money
[424.86 → 433.26] today over 10 years they could pay for themselves with a good implementation okay right okay so that's why
[433.26 → 439.50] i kind of went you know what sure let's do that and while we're at it heck let's do the blinds too
[439.50 → 445.50] because you throw in some temperature sensing and all of a sudden you can kind of go, or you throw in weather data
[445.50 → 451.66] you can be like hey when it's too sunny close them or when it's in when it's the morning open them up
[451.66 → 456.06] so that you have a more natural waking experience, or you know whatever like i want to try that stuff
[456.06 → 461.98] because part of being a tech personality is that I'm supposed to I'm supposed to try stuff and I'm
[461.98 → 468.22] supposed to have some kind of you know experience with it, so this was my one shot my one opportunity
[469.66 → 476.30] now as it turns out these GE switches that i not only bought but also paid to have installed
[476.30 → 481.42] throughout the entire house which as you can imagine is not particularly cheap well they didn't work
[481.42 → 488.78] um there's a bunch we got them adopted they're Z-Wave devices we got them adopted in
[488.78 → 493.10] home assistant we could see all the different parameters lots of cool things you can adjust
[493.10 → 499.34] you can tell it hey you know have a longer delay to start sensing again uh once you're turned off so
[499.34 → 503.18] that like you can walk away from it without it just like turning on immediately oh yeah the default
[503.18 → 509.90] behaviour does that so you've been to my house right how annoying is the default behaviour it's its it's a
[509.90 → 517.02] little annoying yeah i also like I'm not used to my house has like almost no smart stuff it's not a
[517.02 → 521.90] house it's a small apartment so i don't really need anything like there's no there's if I'm like oh
[521.90 → 526.70] I'm going to bed and i have to go turn off all the lights it's like darn that'll take me 15 seconds
[526.70 → 532.78] um so it doesn't really matter um but being in a room and having it just turn off on you like that
[532.78 → 538.06] happened to us the last time i was there actually we were standing around in the room like horsing
[538.06 → 543.18] around we were moving around a fair amount and the light still turned off um that's a little
[543.18 → 550.78] annoying yeah and the really stupid thing about it is that the second you turn it off like it once
[550.78 → 557.18] it reaches off the motion sensor is active again so as you press you can press it walk away from it and
[557.82 → 565.34] it'll turn back on come on stop i actually wish for it to be dark now no problem though because these are
[565.34 → 571.42] all parameters that you can adjust you can change the ramp on and ramp off speed um so we were playing
[571.42 → 576.78] around with it and one of the one of the maybe not first things but one of the first few things
[576.78 → 582.62] that Jake and i wanted to adjust was turning off the motion sensor in places where it doesn't make
[582.62 → 588.70] sense because there could be areas where we want to use the motion sensor for presence detection but we
[588.70 → 595.02] don't necessarily want it to control the lights for example in a bathroom i might want the motion sensor
[595.02 → 603.10] to control the lights whereas in something like an oh i don't know a bedroom okay i don't want motion to
[603.10 → 608.14] turn on the lights I'm freaking sleeping unless i set it on some kind of schedule like
[608.14 → 613.98] i could create uh is this a sex thing that you what are you gesturing about
[613.98 → 619.42] i mean you're talking about motion turning on lights in a bedroom you have to have set that
[619.42 → 625.58] up there's no way you didn't set that up i i i i actually was thinking about it completely from
[625.58 → 633.02] in practical terms okay practical yeah sure okay um i mean look speak for yourself, but people like me
[633.02 → 639.74] we don't need the lights on okay in the bedroom you can find your way around my face might be all right
[639.74 → 647.02] but there are things you don't want to look at okay oh no oh no okay so we tried to turn the motion
[647.02 → 656.70] sensor off it completely didn't work and I'm sorry I'm sorry home assistant team okay my immediate
[656.70 → 664.38] reaction was man bloody open source software bad product uh home assistant come on guys you got to get
[664.38 → 669.58] your act together i didn't say it but i did think it i thought it for a couple of seconds
[669.74 → 675.66] and so we kind of we first tried to troubleshoot through home assistant okay do we need to apply
[675.66 → 679.74] the setting differently do we need to try it again does the switch then we thought does the
[679.74 → 684.30] switch need a little while for it to apply, but then we went we had a different model of switch that's
[684.30 → 690.06] not a dimmer it's the same it looks identical it has the motion sensor, but it's not a dimmer and that
[690.06 → 694.06] one worked fine we were able to disable the motion sensor we went oh hold on a second what's going on
[694.06 → 700.38] here so we checked the home assistant dashboard and the switches are running very different firmwares
[700.38 → 705.34] after some quick googling we realized the switches i just bought are running firmware from as far as we
[705.34 → 714.38] can tell four or five years ago and I'm sitting here going who ships a product like that i literally went
[714.38 → 723.58] to OnePlus's factory like opp's factory, and they showed me how it works when you apply software
[723.58 → 729.50] or firmware to your product on the way off the assembly line and there should be no reason why
[729.50 → 736.14] they can't just load a newer better image so that it ships with updated firmware so supposedly the newer
[736.14 → 746.22] firmware have fixed this is not selling problem right so okay Luke tell me you realize the
[746.22 → 757.26] firmware is out of date on your product what should you do update okay how I'm assuming because it's a
[757.26 → 764.78] smart home device you could OTA over the air okay so because I'm using home assistant um which is
[764.78 → 769.10] like uh i don't do i don't do home automation stuff no that's fine no, no no, no no I'm just this is my
[769.10 → 774.46] this is my assumption it's all good that that could be that could be a valid way because I'm using uh
[774.46 → 781.42] because I'm using home assistant uh you can push an update through home assistant, but it's its not it's
[781.42 → 788.94] not just one ecosystem right like it's this it's an amazing platform that ties in through like
[788.94 → 797.66] third party plugins and all kinds of cool stuff ties in like most smart ecosystems into one cool uh
[797.66 → 804.86] one cool platform one integrated platform um but what it needs me to do is it needs me to
[804.86 → 810.14] point it to a firmware file okay so i can click the device i can go into advanced update firmware and
[810.14 → 818.94] then it prompts me for a file so what's my next step then um you get the file, and you give it
[818.94 → 825.66] the file okay well i mean where should I get the file is this, so this is firmware from task right
[825.66 → 832.78] I'm just kidding from task yeah well i would think so but oh did they not they don't download i went
[832.78 → 839.82] to task's website and the support section of their website okay let's just why don't we visit
[839.82 → 847.26] task together let's do it right now all together I'm trying to find it uh all right so lets uh let's
[847.26 → 855.50] go on a little what no not right now okay by jasko.com wait what why is there what is by jasko.com
[855.50 → 861.50] why do you have by jasko.com as your ad and then jasko.com oh because task applied sciences is a
[861.50 → 868.30] completely different yeah it's its by task okay by jasko.com okay so maybe i might click support
[869.02 → 878.14] does that seem like a pretty cool place to go FAQ resource library refund return policy contact us
[878.14 → 884.30] order support promotion details well resource library maybe right i mean come on let Luke let's
[884.30 → 890.78] let's go through it together let's go through it together i yeah I'm trying to uh the interesting
[890.78 → 896.22] thing to me is googled is autofilling a lot of this, so people are looking for this stuff right
[896.22 → 901.58] and are clearly unable to find it uh but yeah okay I'll go along specifically with you so what i
[901.58 → 908.54] clicked on here was resource library yep okay um and then i scrolled down and found nothing interesting
[908.54 → 919.50] at all energy tips all right well what's our next what's our next uh what's our next path here what
[919.50 → 925.74] do we do at this point the next thing that i did was I i left the by task website and i just went to
[925.74 → 930.70] google and i because i was like whatever i don't know maybe it's weird navigation on their website maybe
[930.70 → 936.94] i don't know how to find it who knows so i just googled by task firmware download or firmware update i did
[936.94 → 941.82] both of them autofilled it knew both of them were things that people are going to look for
[941.82 → 947.58] yeah um and neither of them got me anywhere uh the first page that came up was the support page
[947.58 → 953.82] because that's probably where most humans are going when they're looking for this thing um but
[953.82 → 963.50] there's clearly nothing there um they have a FAQ yep, but it's like i don't know maybe i don't
[963.50 → 970.06] understand this so much but i expected there to be oh this is just a wait hold on so what exact
[970.06 → 979.66] product do you have uh it's an it's a GE and Brighton dimming motion sensor switch so they don't have a
[979.66 → 988.14] section called like switches they have Wi-Fi Z-Wave yeah you could open up the Z-Wave FAQ sure I'm
[988.14 → 996.22] going to open up the Z-Wave FAQ why not now let's control after firmware nope no nope nothing about
[996.22 → 1003.74] that nothing about that okay so then i mean so now i would get angry on Twitter i don't know i went one
[1003.74 → 1008.70] step further i mean come on you can't go straight to being angry yeah no i i would email them
[1008.70 → 1014.86] or something i would have contact support well you know what good guy task um their their their number
[1014.86 → 1020.86] both their local and toll-free are listed on their contact us page they have product support you can
[1020.86 → 1028.38] actually contact their product support both via phone and via live chat so we tried both of them okay
[1028.38 → 1035.66] and you know it seems like a pretty straightforward thing hi i have an outdated firmware i would like to
[1035.66 → 1044.30] get the updated firmware what pray tell Mr cafetière do you think was the response um what i hope was
[1044.30 → 1048.54] the response and what based on the information that i have I think was the response are very
[1048.54 → 1056.62] drastically different things um I'm expecting that the response was like there is no updated firmware or
[1057.50 → 1062.86] no response that's what i expect the response was really okay you're actually wrong on both counts
[1063.66 → 1071.02] nice there is updated firmware there is updated firmware from as recently as i believe earlier
[1071.02 → 1078.78] this month this product is absolutely still receiving updated firmware that as far as we can tell from
[1078.78 → 1084.62] the information we found online seems to resolve the exact issues that we're having with the product
[1086.30 → 1091.74] this sounds great sign me up oh yeah, and we got responses both by phone i waited about 12 minutes on
[1091.74 → 1100.62] hold and via live chat so we got responses and there is new firmware so why am I made is there no way to like
[1100.62 → 1105.42] upload it to the device oh no there's a way to upload it to the device it's through the home assistant
[1105.42 → 1112.22] interface very simple yeah you can up home assistant will allow you to update your Z-Wave device all you
[1112.22 → 1118.70] got to do is plunk the firmware file into the browse file explorer thing, and it'll, it'll upload it
[1118.70 → 1125.42] for you will it update the device oh yeah does it just store it okay so the new so the new
[1125.42 → 1132.86] firmware is on the device no, no no, no i well i i i don't have it oh they just told you that they
[1132.86 → 1136.30] have new firmware they didn't give it to you, they no well why would they do that
[1139.10 → 1139.50] why
[1143.50 → 1146.54] what did they say did they say they just like wouldn't do it or like what
[1147.98 → 1150.70] how did this communication happen i don't understand
[1150.70 → 1158.06] what did this is so they immediately so they very not immediately but they very quickly
[1158.06 → 1163.18] responded and told you that they do indeed have exactly what you need, and it is digital and they
[1163.18 → 1169.50] can give it to you no problem, but they won't, but that's what they said why did what did they say why
[1169.50 → 1173.98] that firmware is proprietary we do not provide that firmware to end users
[1173.98 → 1180.30] oh my god
[1182.78 → 1197.34] oh so i want okay, okay i want to have I i want to have a little fun here okay wow I'm so bothered
[1197.34 → 1207.10] right now it's not even me I'm so annoyed that's wow oh man okay i would like our audience members
[1207.10 → 1213.26] who are artistically inclined okay sorry, sorry i should be muting i would like you guys to draw
[1213.26 → 1218.62] i I'm actually going to request fan art for i think the first time ever i would like you to draw for
[1218.62 → 1226.54] me the executive who made this decision that firmware cannot be provided to end users due to
[1226.54 → 1232.70] because it's proprietary i feel like i don't want to offend golfers but i feel like you should have
[1232.70 → 1239.82] them golfing while he says it i just want to see i just want to see i want to see what
[1239.82 → 1246.78] this story inspires you guys to come up with and so naturally i mean i have to confess i kind of lost it
[1246.78 → 1253.58] i because i like i just yes i don't I i have the same reactions as you except that i I'm out like
[1253.58 → 1262.78] 10 grand plus installation piece so I'm my anger is extremely, extremely high right now and to be
[1262.78 → 1269.74] clear my anger is not just because i wasted money I've I've lost money I've lost lots more money than
[1269.74 → 1276.70] this running a business you make mistakes you lose money you screw things up right um you hire Colton
[1276.70 → 1281.58] you have products that don't work the way that you expected them to i mean we lost a ton
[1281.58 → 1286.86] of money on those Ursa 12k cameras you don't hear me putting black magic on blast because of it because
[1286.86 → 1291.42] at the end of the day we didn't do our due diligence validating it and that's you know that's that's our
[1291.42 → 1296.86] bad it just didn't end up being as good as we had hoped this is not that this is not a product
[1297.42 → 1305.10] not meeting my expectations so I'm in and yeah this is just a blatantly anti-consumer action
[1305.90 → 1313.10] having it be your policy your official actual policy to refuse to provide firmware updates okay so do you
[1313.10 → 1323.10] know how you're supposed to get them wow do you like mail it in or some through uh like a compatible
[1323.10 → 1328.06] i believe you actually can mail them in actually i don't want to rip them all out of my wall mail them
[1328.06 → 1333.18] in and then put them all back in my wall though that is not happening um especially when the real
[1333.18 → 1338.46] solution is so easy to provide me the firmware update so the way it actually works is that you are
[1338.46 → 1346.86] expected to go get a smart hub that is able to i don't know that jazzco maybe provides the firmware
[1346.86 → 1355.02] update too and then updates the switches for you but here's the thing since we shot the video we've
[1355.02 → 1361.98] actually done a little bit more work already on this step one is that there was literally nowhere
[1361.98 → 1367.74] within driving distance for me that i could go get a smart home hub and bring it back in order to try
[1367.74 → 1375.26] this so they're just they're not terribly accessible so really what this means is that probably from
[1375.26 → 1381.82] some integrator there's going to be some kind of hub that maybe and Vasco would not guarantee this
[1381.82 → 1389.58] maybe would have newer firmwares that might help me but they i i i, but they wouldn't guarantee it
[1389.58 → 1394.70] because they already shipped you a device that had firmware those four years of date so they don't know
[1394.70 → 1400.06] they wouldn't guarantee what version maybe the hub's eight years out of date because
[1400.06 → 1406.54] here's the model here's the model the way what they basically embraced is the U.S. telecommunications
[1406.54 → 1414.14] carrier model whereas the manufacturer of the device you write good software with new features i mean
[1414.14 → 1418.14] maybe it's not good i don't know i mean we've seen the level of incompetence here, but you write software
[1418.14 → 1424.30] okay you write software that presumably is helpful otherwise you might, you probably wouldn't bother writing it
[1424.30 → 1435.10] okay and then instead of sending it to the end user's device you wilfully insert smart home controller
[1435.10 → 1443.18] hub manufacturers as the gatekeepers who get to decide whether you will or won't get updated firmware
[1443.18 → 1453.74] that has functionality fixes and new features and making it even worse you wilfully obstinately
[1454.38 → 1460.46] refuse to allow end users who by the way can buy your products i bought them off Amazon like i didn't
[1460.46 → 1466.22] i didn't get it they didn't come from an integrator so these this is a product i can buy and that i can
[1466.22 → 1472.62] adopt in my Z-Wave with my biotech Z-Wave stick and my home assistant controller which is running on a
[1472.62 → 1479.82] Raspberry Pi right now so i absolutely can get it and use it but i cannot update it i can't use it
[1479.82 → 1487.10] properly because you will not provide me the firmware update that i need in order for it to actually work
[1490.22 → 1496.54] how is this how does this make any sense i just i would bring up right now like if you're is you're a
[1496.54 → 1502.78] developer that works for Vasco, and you spend your time making these pieces of firmware that as
[1502.78 → 1509.18] as far as i can tell by this story literally no one ever gets to use um i would just make sure that you
[1509.18 → 1516.46] know that it is a vibrant uh tech space out there right now and there are many other jobs you could have
[1516.46 → 1525.98] and if you all quit at once um you could all have new jobs very quickly um that i don't know i don't
[1525.98 → 1531.10] know how much shack pays, but it's very likely you could even be paid more you could live pretty much
[1531.10 → 1535.42] wherever you want there are tons of different companies that are offering work from home right now
[1535.42 → 1542.30] um yeah i would take this opportunity for a potential career change uh so that more people can
[1542.30 → 1550.30] use what you work on, and it might be more impactful I'm just I'm so I'm so I'm so frustrated right now
[1550.30 → 1555.18] and it's just it's one of those things where like you said you see the auto completions in
[1555.18 → 1562.54] google search because it's just flipping obvious that if there's new firmware for a device that you
[1562.54 → 1568.22] should be able to download it this is how like basically everything has worked forever yeah yeah unless
[1568.22 → 1574.70] you're unless you're unless you're just i don't know unless you're Tesco unless yeah yeah i would I
[1574.70 → 1582.86] would say if i had to guess i would say that some non-tech savvy executive level individual who doesn't
[1582.86 → 1592.22] really understand that giving the like giving the firmware files to a customer uh does not give them the
[1592.22 → 1598.06] source code of the firmware like maybe they just don't maybe they don't understand the difference between
[1598.22 → 1602.70] the firmware and the is this that that statement right there is actually why i brought up that
[1602.70 → 1608.78] like seek a new career thing because clearly the people leading your company have like no idea what's
[1608.78 → 1617.02] going on with you um and probably have taken none of your feedback because i can't imagine i can't
[1617.02 → 1623.90] imagine a developer not bringing up like hey we should just let them have the firmware updates like we can
[1623.90 → 1627.90] even control the pipeline somehow if you want to do it that way whatever but like we should let our
[1627.90 → 1632.22] customers update their own freaking firmware i can't imagine one of the developers hasn't brought that up
[1632.78 → 1638.14] what i can absolutely imagine is whoever came up with this policy just doesn't care at all about what the
[1638.14 → 1645.90] developers say that's the only thing i can think of either no, no engineer in their right mind if i was in fact if i was an
[1645.90 → 1651.42] engineer what i would probably suggest is that we not only have the latest firmware or two
[1652.14 → 1657.02] but we have a form where you can request even older ones i wouldn't necessarily say yeah you should have
[1657.02 → 1662.46] an archive of every possible firmware for it that could be potentially irresponsible but actually you
[1662.46 → 1668.22] know what with the way that they roll out updates hmm that's interesting maybe the maybe you would want
[1668.22 → 1672.38] to have that because that's probably the reason that they ship it with such out-of-date firmware
[1672.38 → 1679.18] because there are probably smart home hub manufacturers that are running like ancient firmwares as their as
[1679.18 → 1685.02] their official platform, and they need to have an earlier one to update from in order to go to that one so
[1685.02 → 1692.86] so i probably would say like hey um we should have the last couple and then as a nuclear option
[1692.86 → 1698.86] we should have this like OG ancient one so that we can point people to it as customer support
[1699.34 → 1704.62] and say hey why don't you try flashing that one, and then you can re-adopt it into your thing
[1705.42 → 1713.90] yeah, and it'll, it'll make its way up to the one that that's needed um so i I'm at the point now
[1714.46 → 1722.30] where it's time to decide what to do there is not an alternative that has a good feeling switch with a
[1722.30 → 1729.58] motion sensor in it so if the goal and like i said you've been you've been over like the motion
[1729.58 → 1733.82] sensing like lights turning on as you walk down the hallway walk into the bathroom go to the garage
[1733.82 → 1740.38] i mean it's kind of cool right it's its generally quite good yeah the only thing and this is always
[1740.38 → 1745.98] my problem with them the only thing is when if you're just chilling in a room, and they turn off
[1745.98 → 1753.10] that's that's the only thing but yeah other than that it's fine and i will admit i pressed the buttons
[1753.10 → 1758.46] sometimes, and they felt all right yeah yeah the quality of the switch itself the actual hardware
[1758.46 → 1768.14] seems fine i just need the firmware, and you know i feel like i oh man i feel like a lot of the time
[1768.14 → 1773.66] i kind of go off the rails and i get furious about stuff and people don't understand it like it
[1773.66 → 1780.38] might seem like you know in a world where so much is going wrong really you can't get the latest
[1780.38 → 1787.18] bells and whistles on your smart light switch wow so out of touch Linus, but it's not about that it's not
[1787.18 → 1793.82] about the magnitude of the grievance it's about the unnecessariness of the grievance it's about the
[1793.82 → 1802.86] shocking stupidity that led to my time and probably countless other people's time being wasted for no
[1802.86 → 1810.06] that's what i was going to say is reason in a lot of situations we bring this up all the time
[1810.06 → 1815.74] right like if it takes is it takes an influencer using their platform in order to get something done
[1816.30 → 1822.78] then it's its not necessarily a win that that thing gets done it's only a win if the entire process
[1822.78 → 1827.90] changes and that's honestly that's I've already told them that's the only outcome that I'll accept
[1827.90 → 1834.22] if they say look we'll send you a NDA, and we'll send you the firmware file I'm going to send them
[1834.22 → 1840.54] one of these because that's not a real solution the real solution is that they have a download portal
[1840.54 → 1847.66] on their website for the firmware for their products that's the only solution yes some way for them to
[1847.66 → 1852.86] have a pipeline for updating their devices i mean I've seen well they have a pipeline it's
[1852.86 → 1858.14] just a stupid one with stupid third-party gatekeepers but i want nothing yeah i don't I don't mean i don't
[1858.14 → 1863.90] mean with some weird hub i mean like through software or something like that but yes um so what i was
[1863.90 → 1869.18] going to say is sometimes when you are in this situation you have to become disproportionately loud
[1869.18 → 1873.98] if that makes sense um I'm talking to the audience right now not you because i think you get it
[1873.98 → 1878.78] but when you run into something like this, and you're like oh I'm potentially the first person
[1878.78 → 1885.58] with a large platform or whatever else that has run into this problem um, and it's pro looking at how
[1885.58 → 1890.78] this goes through communicating with the company it's not like they're like oh yeah here you can have
[1890.78 → 1895.02] it we don't have like a public download form, but you can just have it because that would be fine
[1895.02 → 1903.18] whatever it's not great but who cares um you have to be very loud so that actual change happens
[1903.18 → 1908.62] and they don't just fix it for you yes because the actual goal that you want is you want actual
[1908.62 → 1916.06] change to happen that's exactly it and so if honestly we didn't manage to finish the video the
[1916.06 → 1925.58] video was supposed to be kind of a puff piece like it was supposed to be just hey Linus and Baker are
[1926.54 → 1933.10] horsing around for a few hours like setting up some cool automations and home assistant integration
[1933.10 → 1939.98] and showing you guys the potential of this like really cool technology that yes costs a lot more
[1939.98 → 1946.46] than a regular dumb switch but if you were upgrading anyway, and you have a Raspberry Pi kicking around
[1947.02 → 1953.18] maybe doesn't cost as much more than you thought and for a couple of key rooms could actually be really
[1953.18 → 1959.58] cool like the idea was to just show this technology being used in a way that's really practical and makes
[1959.58 → 1969.34] a ton of sense, and then it turned into this just angry bashing our heads against a brick wall
[1969.34 → 1977.26] why is this happening and i just I'm sorry i don't remember how i started the sentence anymore but
[1977.26 → 1986.62] it was just it was so infuriating task managed to through their own utter incompetence and or ignorance
[1986.62 → 1991.66] turn what should have just been basically a free promo for their product i wasn't even reviewing
[1991.66 → 1998.54] it i was just integrating it into my home and showing cool things it can do right they turned
[1998.54 → 2005.34] that into now this is gonna has to be a multipart video because i didn't manage to successfully
[2005.34 → 2011.82] integrate the freaking product and now i have to find another solution so they basically just turned an easy
[2011.82 → 2026.22] w into a giant l so what do i do now yeah i don't know um there 's's still opportunity i don't
[2026.22 → 2031.82] know what you do to be honest there 's's still opportunity for task to fix their situation though
[2031.82 → 2036.70] well yeah they can um because it's its probably it's probably ignorance like you said ignorance or
[2036.70 → 2040.86] incompetence is probably ignorance they're probably not listening to their dev team this is a big
[2040.86 → 2045.66] opportunity for hopefully their dev team to go like hey this thing that we've probably already
[2045.66 → 2050.30] talked to you about needs to happen, and they could react and add a download section or just start
[2050.30 → 2055.10] allowing people to get the files through support tickets or whatever else what are the odds if
[2055.10 → 2063.58] they're so will very ignorant that they've maintained this policy up until now come on and there's
[2063.58 → 2070.30] i mean i doubt it i mean i even asked i asked explicitly so you make the switch yes we do
[2071.02 → 2078.94] so you write the firmware yes we do, but you will not send it to me no we will not in such simple
[2078.94 → 2082.86] terms because i even thought as i was on the phone with them, i was like okay well maybe this is one of
[2082.86 → 2088.30] those things where because it's its like branded GE but task actually makes it maybe there's some kind
[2088.30 → 2095.10] of weirdness where it's like it's someone else's IP and they can't send it up but the point is just
[2095.10 → 2102.22] however far this has to make it up the chain whoever's making this decision is so far out of
[2102.22 → 2108.78] date that it has to be wilful like you can't possibly you can't possibly be working in the
[2108.78 → 2116.86] technology industry and and and manage to not understand why sending a firmware out to your end
[2116.86 → 2124.78] user is a good idea unless you just sit at your desk la la la la la la la la la la every time an
[2124.78 → 2133.66] engineer comes in and tries to talk to you, i don't know how else to put it yeah i mean it's an it's a
[2133.66 → 2138.70] horrible experience, and we've seen a lot of home automation brands go down i think you mentioned that
[2138.70 → 2146.94] earlier in the show um it makes sense it's even at this point i would say it's a relatively young space
[2147.74 → 2153.42] for sure you're absolutely right so yeah i mean there's an absolute opportunity for jazz to just
[2154.14 → 2160.38] fail as a company if they don't become more uh, uh i wouldn't even say that's user-centric
[2161.34 → 2166.14] i i i was going to say if is they don't become more user-centric but i don't think that's even fair it's
[2166.14 → 2171.90] it's like if they become less uh oppressive to their users because forcing people to have
[2172.78 → 2178.70] stuff that's like a brand-new product that's four years out of date is like not okay like
[2178.70 → 2184.22] and i don't know how else to say that um so they just need to figure it out and make sure that that's
[2184.22 → 2194.30] not like allowed to be a thing that's it so what i could do Luke is i could go out and i could buy
[2194.30 → 2199.50] a compatible hub i could adopt all the switches with that hub well maybe because you don't know
[2199.50 → 2205.66] if that hub is going to have the latest firmware or not that's true okay but i could try that you
[2205.66 → 2212.30] could try it okay i could painstakingly adopt over a hundred switches to my new hub beautiful
[2212.30 → 2219.74] update the firmware it is possible that i could have that Z-Wave hub act as like a daughter Z-Wave
[2219.74 → 2225.02] controller device for home assistant we don't know that for sure we haven't explored that
[2225.02 → 2231.34] if that's not possible than what i could do is i could um whatever the opposite of adopt is i could
[2231.34 → 2236.94] disconnect the switches painstakingly from that hub and then i could go around and adopt them all
[2236.94 → 2244.54] with their new flashed firmware back into home assistant i could do that but unless we can use
[2244.54 → 2249.74] that new hub as a daughter hub then anytime i needed to update the firmware again in the future
[2249.74 → 2255.18] which has i think it appears to be being actively developed still uh i would probably have to jump
[2255.18 → 2261.10] through those same hoops again meaning that that is not an acceptable solution so here's what I'm
[2261.10 → 2267.90] leaning to here's what I'm leaning toward i wish to have motion sensing in my house particularly for
[2267.90 → 2273.98] hallways stairwells bathrooms utility spaces it's its been really nice actually it's really cool
[2274.54 → 2281.58] the only way to do that is to get a separate device I'll have to get a separate motion sensor
[2281.58 → 2287.42] and I'll have to get that embedded into the wall i have talked to my general contractor it looks like
[2287.42 → 2292.62] they can do it uh they can just cut a hole next to the switches and then just kind of work
[2292.62 → 2298.46] around the back to tap into the electrical wiring in the box uh hook up a five volt power supply there's
[2298.46 → 2303.10] one from biotech it's like a seven in one or something like that moisture humidity well those are the
[2303.10 → 2308.70] same thing whatever the point is it does temperature uh UV like a bunch of stuff put that next to
[2308.70 → 2313.58] all the light switches serving essentially the same function but at that point i wouldn't have to have
[2313.58 → 2318.94] these task switches anymore and the task switches even just using them as dumb switches is an
[2318.94 → 2323.74] inconvenience there is a way without doing it through software which doesn't work remember because
[2323.74 → 2328.22] the old buggy firmware it doesn't work there is a way to turn off the motion sensor and just have
[2328.22 → 2333.02] them work as a dumb switch, but you have to pull off the plate and like there's a third button that
[2333.02 → 2340.70] you have to like press and hold, and they're not they're not that good they're not better than just
[2340.70 → 2346.38] like a normal dumb switch in my opinion they're not i would prefer a normal dumb switch if it
[2346.38 → 2354.70] was a dumb switch um yeah like it feels good but like we're being realistic with how good it can be
[2354.70 → 2362.62] while still packing all this other stuff in it yes so what i think will happen is i am going to try to
[2362.62 → 2369.74] find a sponsor maybe someone with you know an attitude chip on their shoulder someone a little snarky
[2369.74 → 2376.06] and I'm going to try and find a sponsor who's like yeah we want to be part of this and i think that through a
[2376.06 → 2379.50] combination you're making you're making home automation switches now through a combination
[2380.86 → 2387.18] through a combination of sponsor dollars and just plain eating it i think what we'll do is we'll just
[2387.18 → 2393.98] rip every task switch out of the wall replace them with someone who has we'll, you know we'll work
[2393.98 → 2398.78] through the community i know Jake's already doing some research replace them with someone who has a way
[2398.78 → 2408.54] more consumer friendly approach to firmware and just uh just have it be done a second follow-up video
[2408.54 → 2416.38] that's just a big f you now jasko can stop this but the only way to stop this is not to appease me
[2416.38 → 2423.66] it's not about me at this point the only way to stop this is to fix your policies is to educate
[2423.66 → 2431.02] yourselves internally about what firmware updates are what the potential implications of sending out
[2431.02 → 2438.14] firmware updates are and learning that there's only one possible outcome to this lesson that you're
[2438.14 → 2443.10] learning and that is that you need to support your products through firmware updates that are readily
[2443.10 → 2449.10] available to your paying customers uh fair and yes innately that's the word i was looking for
[2449.10 → 2453.64] uh they've been quite involved in the home assistant community and would very likely be on board yes innately
[2453.66 → 2459.42] innately has actually reached out to us already in fact they were the number two choice and the only
[2459.42 → 2464.78] reason we went with the GE task ones was for the motion sensor because i didn't want to put those
[2464.78 → 2469.74] additional freaking holes in my wall for separate motion sensors which now ultimately it looks like
[2469.74 → 2476.30] I'm going to have to do anyway innately actually reached out to us and said hey we know you're looking
[2476.30 → 2481.10] for smart switches we'd be potentially willing to work with you on firmware updates and like build new
[2481.10 → 2487.10] features for you if you require them so basically i made a mistake Jake pushed hard for
[2487.10 → 2491.82] the innately switch that's the other end of the spectrum that's fantastic and i really wanted the
[2491.82 → 2496.06] motion sensor but like there's also stuff on the task switches that i don't even know if the new
[2496.06 → 2501.74] firmware is going to fix because i can't get it and i can't try it um like for example we want to
[2501.74 → 2507.26] operate it without a fade on and fade off it there is a parameter that we did get working for adjusting
[2507.26 → 2513.66] the speed of the fade on and fade off but in some rooms like for example in my son's room he wants
[2513.66 → 2518.78] to use a smart uh bulb he wants to use like one of those Yee lights so that he can have like RGB
[2518.78 → 2523.34] lights in his room and i was like oh yeah that's that's cool, but smart bulbs don't always play well
[2523.34 → 2530.14] with smart switches and one of the reasons is that smart switches tend to um do have like fade on fade off
[2530.14 → 2536.22] or dimming functionalities that are not that don't work well with a smart bulb now that doesn't mean i
[2536.22 → 2539.90] want to put a dumb switch in there because if i wanted to do something like turn off all the lights
[2539.90 → 2543.90] in the house I'd like to have the switch be controlled without having the Yee light app on
[2543.90 → 2549.66] my phone tied into homelessness I'd like to have a minimal number of apps and tie-ins
[2549.66 → 2555.42] required to have basic functionality so what i wanted was the ability to set the switch to have an
[2555.42 → 2561.50] instant on instant off mode that you can that you can activate i don't know if the task one has that
[2561.50 → 2566.46] but in a valley if they don't well I'd be able to say hey, hey here's what i want here's why i want
[2566.46 → 2570.54] it here's why I'd be beneficial to your entire community not just to me, and they expressed
[2570.54 → 2578.14] interest in working with us on that so i think that's the update guys you're still going to
[2578.14 → 2586.38] want to watch the video just because it is such an emotional roller coaster like i can't express we
[2586.38 → 2591.10] were really pressed for time that day we were trying to get the smart lighting video done and
[2591.10 → 2598.14] the HVAC update one done and then um this just completely threw a wrench in what was supposed to
[2598.14 → 2605.74] be a simple shoot where we adopted some switches showed some cool automations and called it a freaking
[2605.74 → 2613.98] day and just this is one of those situations where having labs like running and having the labs' website
[2613.98 → 2621.34] would be pretty cool because I'm sitting here thinking like i want to make sure because this
[2621.34 → 2627.66] this is a terrible thing for someone to run into um especially if they don't have a platform right um
[2627.66 → 2633.66] yeah for sure and i don't want people to run into it but if you just is you title the YouTube video
[2633.66 → 2641.26] like you will have firmware problems if you buy task switches uh that's just like not really going to go
[2641.26 → 2647.02] very well so because just because it's just very boring of a title so i want to make sure that
[2647.02 → 2652.14] it would get traction with people that might be like should I buy this switch and i would hope that
[2652.14 → 2657.50] this content would come up but having the labs' website you could absolutely do something like that
[2658.14 → 2665.98] um I'm excited man I'm excited yeah yeah uh why don't we do a couple of merch messages we've actually
[2665.98 → 2673.10] got some deals on LTT store for this week uh we are launching a new oh, oh dang it oh i don't have
[2673.10 → 2678.38] it on me, we're launching a new headphone t-shirt uh okay what is the oh crap what is the best way for
[2678.38 → 2684.38] me to do this oh okay the first thing I'm going to do is share you uh in a valley's firmware download
[2684.38 → 2692.38] page which includes beta firmwares and change logs and all the things that you should have on a firmware
[2692.38 → 2698.38] download page so that's pretty cool and then the next thing we're going to do is head over to ltdstore.com
[2698.94 → 2704.14] where we have the new headphone shirt that's right ladies and gentlemen a new design from the one
[2704.14 → 2713.18] and only haloid pan looking pretty sharp kind of audio inspired in other news we've got a couple of
[2713.18 → 2719.74] promos this week we need to generate i mean look I'm all about being honest with you guys okay
[2720.46 → 2726.06] we need to generate some cash flow to pay for our final payments for screwdrivers and
[2726.06 → 2732.46] backpacks i have stubbornly refused to take pre-orders on them so i can't take your money in that way so
[2732.46 → 2740.22] we're running some promos we're doing a free shipping promo but because of some limitations in Shopify's
[2740.22 → 2751.74] systems um the free shipping promo is honour system in a sense if you kind of get what i mean discount code
[2751.74 → 2759.34] honour the American way or honour with an u the British Canadian way will get you free shipping on orders
[2759.34 → 2768.78] of 89.99 or more it is intended for use with the team red and couch ripper pillows please don't use
[2768.78 → 2780.22] it for anything else that's right free shipping on your entire order okay if you buy all products here
[2780.22 → 2788.54] we go the couch ripper or team red pillows in i believe it's the largest sizes so team red 50 by 50
[2788.54 → 2796.70] centimetre this guy right here or the couch ripper which is this guy right here in the i believe it's uh
[2796.70 → 2803.90] yeah 65 by 50 size so the big guy right here so both of them are over that threshold and you
[2803.90 → 2811.82] will have free shipping for your entire order on ltdstore.com don't use it for anything else the
[2811.82 → 2817.50] code probably ends at midnight pacific tonight unless nick thinks that um it's gotten out of control
[2817.50 → 2821.90] and shuts it off early okay bye that is the end of my that is the end of my notes about it
[2824.06 → 2830.30] and with that we have some merch messages oh yeah sure that makes sense from Tim Linus did your trip to
[2830.30 → 2835.42] the intel dev centre give you any ideas for testing methods or method methodologies for the lab oh my
[2835.42 → 2841.50] god i mean there's so much stuff there that's just beyond what we could afford to buy even if we wanted
[2841.50 → 2846.38] to i mean it's not like we're gonna man did you watch even Linus's blank check isn't that blank
[2846.38 → 2855.42] my dude yeah man my blank check it just it's not long enough you know it's a blank short check short
[2855.42 → 2864.30] check okay yeah and cash is a little tight right now uh over the next sort of 12 to 24 months my
[2864.30 → 2870.54] belief is that um through screwdriver backpack some of the other launches we have coming store is
[2870.54 → 2877.02] really intended to fund a lot of the lab equipment we're going to need and then my goal
[2877.02 → 2881.82] just to give you guys some idea of how i expect the business model to work is i don't I don't really
[2881.82 → 2889.02] expect to make back the equipment if that makes sense what i need lab to be is self-sufficient on
[2889.02 → 2896.62] like a month-to-month basis so through the site um through any like channels any additional YouTube
[2896.62 → 2901.02] channels that we spin up around lab content or anything like that i need it to be break even to
[2901.02 → 2909.42] cover its own payroll and its own monthly mortgage or rent right but the equipment the goal is that we
[2909.42 → 2916.30] make enough on store that we can that we can afford those big outlays right and get labs to the
[2916.30 → 2921.58] point where it's set up enough that it can that it can coast that's the goal um
[2924.86 → 2929.26] ltdstore.com you know it's been great it's been one of the biggest success stories for us ever
[2929.26 → 2932.78] but we're not going to be able to afford a lot of Luke did you watch those videos
[2932.78 → 2942.86] uh i watched some of them a lotto me is a Russian car, so there's a cooler lotto okay so
[2942.86 → 2950.94] i believe it's the lotto is the one that allows intel to fire a laser at a silicon die and actually
[2950.94 → 2960.22] change the properties so that they can test what redesigning the um what redesigning the chip and
[2960.22 → 2966.86] re-manufacturing it would do it's utterly incredible i didn't even think technology like
[2966.86 → 2972.62] that existed, but it does and intel has it in their testing facility like I'll never have
[2972.62 → 2979.02] anything like that um i mean even the way that they have uh heated, and chilled water plumbed throughout
[2979.02 → 2984.62] the building and then running to all the test benches so you just turn on a tap and then have you
[2984.62 → 2988.70] have a controller there that gives you the exact temperature of water you want to test like that's
[2988.70 → 2993.58] it's not the kind of thing that is likely for us to be able to do, but we are sweet though it's pretty
[2993.58 → 2999.58] sweet but i saw that part there was some inspiration like i thought it was really cool the way they had
[2999.58 → 3004.46] their test benches in drawers like i could see us maybe implementing something like that it'd be the
[3004.46 → 3013.90] IKEA version of it but a lot of a lot of their uh a lot of their test benches looked like uh and so i
[3013.90 → 3018.46] I'm pretty sure i watched the whole thing I'm just not remembering names and stuff um a lot of their
[3018.46 → 3025.34] test benches looked like just like open bench table style configurations and a lot of their
[3025.34 → 3031.82] their like racks and stuff just looked like extrusion i think we could get that type of stuff but some of
[3031.82 → 3035.82] some of the machines and things that they had liked you were saying that like oh we can just set
[3035.82 → 3040.86] the temperature of the water to be whatever we want and stuff like that um without having the loops
[3040.86 → 3046.86] getting all screwed up and yada like that's that's some pretty advanced stuff um but yeah i
[3046.86 → 3051.18] think the benches and having them slide out and stuff there's there are easy ways to do that
[3052.30 → 3053.26] we could do that for sure
[3053.26 → 3064.94] from Eric UHF Cuban aeon or seraphim i started out in UHF and so i just never really learned the other races
[3064.94 → 3071.58] good question from that i do the same thing yeah right because i taught him how to play
[3073.74 → 3078.22] from anon i want to get your opinion on password managers love the idea behind them, but it's hard to
[3078.22 → 3085.02] trust one company with all my passwords yeah i don't know Luke you want to speak to that don't trust them
[3087.02 → 3088.78] good call try to
[3091.34 → 3097.34] it is almost feels like a necessity in the modern age because you're if you do like anything
[3097.34 → 3103.74] you're going to have way too many passwords um single sign on is becoming more popular um that is an
[3103.74 → 3109.66] interesting thing, but that also has a very similar problem um where one thing is going to control
[3109.66 → 3115.74] access to many other things um i think there's going to be some major disruption to passwords and
[3115.74 → 3120.22] logins in the next like five to ten years i think there's going to be some extremely major disruption to
[3120.22 → 3126.86] that whole field um, but there is a range of security options that you can choose there are some like
[3126.86 → 3133.58] self-hosted password managers that you can have um so that's that's a much higher level of security
[3133.58 → 3138.22] that you can have if that's something that you're looking for there is also some expertise some
[3138.22 → 3144.22] maintenance um and some management that come along with doing that so you have to be willing to actually
[3144.22 → 3148.78] do that it's like it's one of those things where i feel like there 's's a group of people that
[3148.78 → 3155.10] will jump straight to well you should self-host it without really considering that for a lot of people
[3155.10 → 3163.34] even the act of setting up a password manager is a lot to expect yeah yeah for sure yeah um so that's
[3163.34 → 3170.22] not it's not an option for everyone and then if you do decide to use one um just make sure
[3170.22 → 3177.58] like if you follow some like news setup of some types add to your feed the keyword of
[3177.58 → 3184.46] the name of that company um so you can keep on top of it and hope that it's like open source so
[3184.46 → 3191.74] that the security of it is constantly being evaluated um and to be clear make sure that 2fa
[3191.74 → 3198.62] is on everything is not a magic silver bullet no, no no it just means that it's constantly being
[3198.62 → 3203.98] evaluated by a multitude of sources unless it's a very small open source project and nobody happens
[3203.98 → 3210.22] to be looking at it absolutely true it could be completely abandoned where, and it could be a
[3210.22 → 3217.02] situation where a zero-day lasts forever because no one ever actually notices that it's there um so
[3217.02 → 3223.02] yeah it's uh i don't know the whole world of that type of stuff is a little sketch right now unless
[3223.02 → 3230.06] you want to self-host, but that's also uh complicated and if you self-host a password manager, and you're
[3230.06 → 3237.50] not managing the backups for it properly you're going to have a bad day you're going to have a really, really bad day
[3237.50 → 3245.18] um but yeah also so i have heard this before i never realized that it was a thing but some people
[3245.18 → 3248.94] think like oh i have a password manager and all my passwords have like 100 characters in them, i don't
[3248.94 → 3255.34] need 2fa that's just stupid and like i don't have anything else to say about that that's just unintelligent i
[3255.34 → 3264.62] i just okay it is a thing that has been said no um you don't even know them but okay i just i don't
[3264.62 → 3274.22] know yeah um you need 2fa is like hugely powerful right now yeah 3fa if you can um and ideally
[3274.22 → 3281.10] you want to pick good factors SMS is not a very good factor for you SMS is a trash factor yeah there's
[3281.10 → 3288.86] almost nothing left on SMS for me and that is on purpose because phone numbers are so trivial to
[3288.86 → 3295.82] find they and taking them over and hijacking them is so trivially easy through social engineering
[3295.82 → 3302.46] and no amount of better encryption is going to save you from social engineering there's nothing that you
[3302.46 → 3306.30] can do because the social engineering to get your phone number has nothing to do with you
[3307.18 → 3313.66] it has to do with the phone company um i had something to say and i don't remember darn it
[3313.66 → 3314.78] it was probably perfect though
[3318.46 → 3327.10] oh yeah uh if is you have a company uh or an organization that only does SMS 2fa um reach out to
[3327.90 → 3333.26] reach out to them in some way uh if is you have to use them reach out to them in some way like
[3333.26 → 3340.30] the Canadian government um and ask them to support things other than just SMS oh that's insane did I
[3340.30 → 3350.54] ever tell you about my stupid conversation with Equifax support no oh my god oh man so um
[3351.18 → 3356.46] equip okay i don't okay it might not have been Equifax it might have been the other one but for some
[3356.46 → 3363.90] reason i had to have credit monitoring through one of those services yeah i literally got a
[3363.90 → 3369.66] newsletter from them talking about the importance of 2fa for protecting your own security and this is
[3370.22 → 3375.02] literally like it was Equifax or the other one what's what's the other what's the other stupid one
[3375.58 → 3380.70] it was the main one there's two there are two big ones there's Equifax and then there's the other
[3380.70 → 3387.10] big one and i literally got a newsletter from them talking about the importance of two fact
[3387.10 → 3391.26] TransUnion that's the other one so i don't remember which one of them it was but I'm on the phone with
[3391.26 → 3398.06] them going hey you guys like have all my financial like credit information in here, and you don't even
[3398.06 → 3405.02] support two factors you literally sent me a newsletter saying how important it is, and you literally don't
[3405.02 → 3411.50] even support it unbelievable what can be done they're like basically entry tier customers for
[3412.62 → 3423.26] like yeah so guys if you work for if you yeah, yeah anyway if you work for a company that doesn't do 2fa
[3423.26 → 3430.38] properly please advocate because it's so so so important and if it's any kind of
[3430.38 → 3437.26] important financial or otherwise personal uh potentially compromising information you absolutely
[3437.26 → 3443.34] have to have it be required it and even then you still have to be careful because you could be
[3443.34 → 3446.78] holistically compromised, and they could still get into your systems or whatever else you still have
[3446.78 → 3453.66] to be careful nothing is a fully encompassing solution but 2fa is huge deal oh no the horror
[3453.66 → 3459.26] stories are showing up in the chat copy mac and cheese says T-Mobile apparently recently killed off email
[3459.26 → 3468.22] 2fa forcing you to use SMS like why i mean i okay i can tell you why because sending emails
[3468.22 → 3474.78] costs T-Mobile money whereas to whereas uh texts probably don't that's probably why run their own
[3474.78 → 3480.46] thing i was going to usually say text is more expensive than email but yeah they run their own thing that's
[3480.46 → 3487.98] funny uh glad to hear it infinity puddle okay their school district is turning off SMS and moving to
[3487.98 → 3494.86] uh required 2fa love to see it awesome good very cool good happy to hear it all right money hit us
[3494.86 → 3500.78] with a couple more, and then we'll move on to another good job too to those it teams because i know um and
[3500.78 → 3507.02] they probably don't hear it very often because government and uh essentially government it
[3507.02 → 3512.86] teams often have to move very slowly there are a lot of steps and hoops and stuff that they have to jump
[3512.86 → 3517.74] through so a lot of push stuff like that through to educate yes so if you're able to push something
[3517.74 → 3521.98] like that through that's a big win good job yeah props you're doing you're doing the lord's work
[3521.98 → 3526.30] because no one else is going to thank you for it, you're going to get a ton of angry emails what do you
[3526.30 → 3531.74] mean i have to do this to do my password is one to update my account and i can always remember it and
[3531.74 → 3540.62] i just type it in so fast keep doing what you're doing it's really important all right oh okay we got
[3540.62 → 3547.26] someone asking why is SMSA so bad because SMSA if someone hijacks your sim like if they call your
[3547.26 → 3553.98] carrier and pretend to be you and get a new sim issued in your name it will have your number so if
[3553.98 → 3560.14] they have compromised your passwords in some other way they can quickly go log into things two-factor
[3560.14 → 3565.50] authenticate change out all the phone numbers associated with your two-factor and lock you out
[3565.50 → 3570.62] of your accounts, and it is a real nightmare if you don't happen to be like a public figure like i am
[3570.62 → 3577.50] getting my accounts back is relatively straightforward i call my YouTube rep and I'm like yo i need my
[3577.50 → 3584.70] account back now it's frozen it's done it's out I'm authenticated they know who i am but i went through
[3584.70 → 3589.82] this back before that was not the case i lost my YouTube account and getting it back took a month
[3589.82 → 3597.34] it's its a really awful stressful experience and for a lot of people like and there's so much
[3597.34 → 3602.06] uncertainty will I ever get it back what else have they compromised while they've had access to my
[3602.06 → 3606.62] email what credentials are they changing email is basically the key to your life right
[3608.54 → 3612.86] it's rough sorry Luke i didn't mean to cut you off there's a bit of a leg on he's not actually here i
[3612.86 → 3618.78] don't know if you know it's its it's always it's way harder to do wan show remotely it's just it is i
[3618.78 → 3625.58] i remember after the like the first era of isolation wan show when we first did wan show back
[3625.58 → 3631.42] in office again it was like whoa this is so much easier um but even the small amount of delay you
[3631.42 → 3634.38] don't notice it very much when you're like gaming and stuff but when you're trying to host a show
[3634.38 → 3639.74] it's its pretty noticeable um what was I going to say though i don't really remember but yeah anyway
[3639.74 → 3646.62] it's its just it happens more often than you'd think social engineering is a very um in some ways
[3646.62 → 3653.18] it's like super difficult to be like perfect at it but then also anyone can try it and
[3653.18 → 3660.30] if you fail it's like whatever because you just hang up yeah by the way can I just say i can totally
[3660.30 → 3666.62] see the same thing that i went through when i had covid and i hosted the show your brain's just a little
[3666.62 → 3672.86] stupid today yeah summing way more than usual, and you're just like dude I've built it all week
[3674.06 → 3680.06] yeah that's the like one thing that I've experienced i yeah I've been I've been talking to my like
[3680.06 → 3684.70] family and stuff about it um and there's a there are a couple specific things because my stuff and that's
[3684.70 → 3690.06] all whatever but um this more than any other sickness that I've had i just yeah i just feel a
[3690.06 → 3698.06] little wagged you're like you're kind of an idiot today it's great and i mean that in a good way i
[3698.06 → 3707.34] mean normally you're sharp and so when you're not i notice that's great yeah slow mode loop
[3707.34 → 3711.98] chat uh why don't we do our sponsors real quick here actually before we do before we do some more
[3711.98 → 3716.14] merch messages oh i just ripped that tab out of my browser perfect that's what i needed to do

[3849.58 → 3855.66] keyboards and then you type that into your browser with.com really easy i swear you got this grandpa
[3856.30 → 3861.82] i believe in you peter mice.com for serious my grandpa could probably handle this no problem

[3869.02 → 3876.86] you so much they sent us chairs and we needed chairs and they like actually freaking rock i love

[3888.14 → 3895.98] and Napa leather they're all great i actually couldn't tell you a personal favourite um man the
[3897.50 → 3905.42] soft weave fabric I'd say probably looks the best but i didn't go with it for my land room at the new house
[3905.42 → 3912.94] because i have a cat so in that case you might want to go with either the hybrid leatherette or the
[3912.94 → 3918.14] Napa leather they offer up to a five-year extended warranty with a 49-day return policy so you're
[3918.14 → 3923.02] covered if anything goes wrong and what's really great about secret lab is that we've been working
[3923.02 → 3928.06] with them a long time, and they have done a great job of addressing community concerns that have been
[3928.06 → 3932.22] raised with us, i mean that's a big thing that we look for in our long-time sponsors so massive shout out
[3932.22 → 3938.14] to secret lab uh putting customers first you can save up to 130 during their spring sale we're going
[3938.14 → 3945.26] to have that link down below great chairs and great people all right what do you want to talk about
[3945.26 → 3955.10] next Mr cafetière um let's see what we got here how many we did a few merch messages yeah um we can wow
[3955.10 → 3961.90] that's a really long topic god you're so gassed on game pass Xbox put them on blast can the
[3961.90 → 3967.02] subscription model really last this is a super long topic what i saw was that Kodak mentioned
[3967.02 → 3973.10] on i think it was twitter that they were like burnt out on game pass or something interesting
[3973.10 → 3978.94] and then and then Xbox just like flamed them saying something along the lines of like tell me you only
[3978.94 → 3984.78] ever play triple-a games without telling me you only ever play triple-a games um and i think that's the
[3984.78 → 3989.90] whole story and then the notes are like an entire page long um, but it says can the subscription model
[3989.90 → 3994.94] really last i think yes honestly everyone that I've talked to about the Xbox game pass for a long
[3994.94 → 4000.94] time has been very happy with it and i think we're in one of those situations where everyone's going to
[4000.94 → 4006.70] be really happy with it because companies can be very aggressive on pricing and availability yeah and
[4006.70 → 4012.06] then once everyone switches over to not buying games and just being on subscription models then we're
[4012.06 → 4016.62] going to have too many subscription models, and they're going to cost too much um the same thing
[4016.62 → 4020.22] that's happening with video streaming services right now i think we're going to go through this
[4020.22 → 4025.50] it's basically freaking cable it's cable now yeah and there's all these people putting their
[4025.50 → 4031.58] pirate hats back on um and i think we're gonna we're going to go down the same path but right now
[4031.58 → 4036.78] in this exact moment things like i would probably say especially game pass in my opinion i think
[4036.78 → 4043.26] game pass is probably the best one um, but it's an extremely strong value yeah game pass is insane
[4043.26 → 4047.90] like the value proposition on is nuts, and then they're bringing in Netflix was nuts when it was
[4047.90 → 4055.82] seven dollars too and how long exactly a fair amount of time but yeah it's completely gone uh and i
[4055.82 → 4061.10] strongly believe we're going to be going down the same path um but yeah Kodak's point was just like
[4061.10 → 4069.02] stupid and honestly Xbox was probably right um they probably just play like new triple a title and
[4069.02 → 4073.34] there aren't a ton hitting right now because it's not the time of the year that they usually hit really
[4073.34 → 4079.50] hard um if i can give a shout-out for something actually super cool that I'm personally very interested in
[4079.50 → 4087.26] that i think is launching today um is a mod for Elden Ring co-op um which makes me like
[4087.26 → 4091.98] way more interested in playing it oh I'm going to play i haven't tried it yet you down yeah i mean
[4091.98 → 4095.98] either so sure yeah all right i mean right now I'm probably just going to die constantly because
[4096.94 → 4105.74] brain like brain leg, but you know uh but the uh it's output leg the screen updates and looks like
[4105.74 → 4115.42] like hold on a second i died um but yeah it looks amazing you can look it up it's made by a
[4115.98 → 4121.66] well-known fodder it adds a lot of the things to multiplayer Elden Ring that a lot of players would
[4121.66 → 4126.86] want i understand that a lot of like hardcore souls players can be like that's not the
[4126.86 → 4133.02] way the game's meant to be played i don't care i like co-op games um you can both mount at the
[4133.02 → 4137.10] same time if one of you like dies during a boss fight it switches to a spectator mode so you can
[4137.10 → 4142.78] watch your buddy play oh that's cool it scales you can play with you can play with up to four people
[4142.78 → 4147.02] at a time, and it scales the difficulty of the game based on the amount of people that are in the lobby
[4147.66 → 4153.66] it sounds like an amazing mod like it's extremely well done it's like literally everything i would
[4153.66 → 4159.02] have wanted from Elden Ring multiplayer is theoretically going to be in the game it's going to be launching on
[4159.02 → 4167.02] nexus mods um i don't um that sounds like first party tier feature set like whatever i mean i
[4167.02 → 4171.82] guess we'll have to try it and see if it's any good but like yeah like it's supposed to release today so
[4171.82 → 4178.22] i mean i haven't played it yet, but it's supposed to be yeah absolutely like fantastic wow um hey there's
[4178.22 → 4184.30] a good comment in twitch chat for a change doomwalker42 says imagine gatekeeping how a RPG should be played
[4184.30 → 4194.46] that's ironic yeah yeah what you said yeah no i will role-play however i wish that's the
[4194.46 → 4202.94] whole point um it looks like it's yeah so I'm pretty sure it launched today it already has 21 000 downloads
[4203.42 → 4211.10] um like it is yeah people are on this it's called seamless co-op for uh for Elden Ring so
[4211.10 → 4215.58] yeah maybe check it out I'm definitely going to check it out um but yeah i know there 's's
[4215.58 → 4220.78] not a ton going on right now for new large triple a title which is probably why you're bored with
[4220.78 → 4225.82] game pass if all you play is new larger but here's an alternate perspective it never happens
[4226.38 → 4231.74] mike rose of indie developer no more robots claimed that game pass is guaranteeing success for dozens
[4231.74 → 4236.70] of devs every single month by paying them their entire dev costs and then some on day one
[4236.70 → 4242.46] he went on to explain that normally you launch a game it costs x to make, and you hope that your
[4242.46 → 4247.18] game plus marketing was good enough to make x back so you can start making a profit if you're on game
[4247.18 → 4251.34] pass at launch it's likely you've just instantly made x on launch day that's that's incredible i mean
[4251.34 → 4257.10] that's what that's what we wanted for this model was to have more predictability to your income as a
[4257.10 → 4264.70] game developer because we've seen that that feast and famine just chew up and spit out studio after studio
[4264.70 → 4270.62] after studio and some of them folded some of them got acquired, but the story is ultimately the same
[4270.62 → 4277.34] that as they scaled up the ambition of their projects they reached a point where they just
[4277.98 → 4287.82] yeah where the risk was just too high, and they couldn't keep going, so yeah, yeah game pass very cool
[4288.70 → 4293.90] i don't have like a huge amount else to say about this topic i just i saw that tweet too and i kind of
[4293.90 → 4298.46] laughed at it as well because it's like there's just so many games on game pass that there's just
[4298.46 → 4304.22] like no way that unless you have that like fatigue that people get with things like steam or if
[4304.22 → 4308.70] they own like 500 games they're like i have nothing to play there's like at least 50 games that you know
[4308.70 → 4312.30] they'd be excited to play, but they don't want to scroll through the entire list and like look into each
[4312.30 → 4317.02] one and actually remember why they were why they bought whatever they bought and why they wanted to
[4317.02 → 4322.94] play it, or maybe they got it in a pack of like 10 things from humble bundle 10 years ago, and they don't
[4322.94 → 4329.66] know that it's actually good or whatever else um but there are so many things in Xbox game pass than
[4329.66 → 4336.38] that unless literally all you do 16 hours a day is tried to play through every single game in your
[4336.38 → 4340.78] game pass library and even then i don't know i feel like you wouldn't have made it all the way through
[4340.78 → 4344.86] yeah like there's an insane amount of content if you're not finding anything to play in game pass you
[4344.86 → 4349.82] might not be opening you might not be broadening your horizons enough try something new you might like
[4349.82 → 4354.30] it you might hate it but hey you didn't pay anything for if it's game pass that's that's
[4354.30 → 4359.02] the beauty of it try something else if you need it clear like I'm I'm saying i you know I'm supporting
[4359.02 → 4366.38] game pass i like i love the idea i actually don't have a subscription to game pass um actually what's
[4366.38 → 4367.50] i don't have a subscription
[4369.82 → 4376.14] me neither yeah, but it's really great i mean i like to i like to buy games on sale and then play
[4376.14 → 4381.26] them at my leisure i like to own my library of content but i consider that a luxury that it is
[4381.26 → 4388.38] an utterly unnecessary luxury i have friends that have game pass and i have recommended game pass
[4389.26 → 4395.58] to some of those friends and i have recommended game pass publicly before um the reason why i don't
[4395.58 → 4400.86] have it is because i will recommend it because it's just a very good deal and if you're trying to be
[4400.86 → 4407.10] economic about things and all that type of stuff which a lot of people should then it probably makes
[4407.10 → 4415.18] a lot of sense to go with it um the reason why i don't is that I'm trying to lean more on
[4416.30 → 4422.30] my stuff which is where i buy like as many physical copies of games basically as possible
[4422.30 → 4428.94] as long as it's not like nerd you know when they switched pc games to like you go buy it in
[4428.94 → 4433.82] the store, and you get a box and inside there's a sticker that's the code yep that's stupid i don't
[4433.82 → 4438.78] care about that I'm not buying those um but like for switch i buy as many physical games as possible
[4438.78 → 4445.58] for pc i buy as many like buy it one time own it forever games as possible um, but that's that's a
[4445.58 → 4451.18] personal thing so that's up to other people decide how they want to deal with that we should
[4451.18 → 4455.50] probably jump into a couple more topics because i realized i have a badminton night thing uh that i
[4455.50 → 4459.82] forgot about Yvonne showed up kind of hovering around the Sancho set and i think that's what
[4459.82 → 4462.62] she's trying to remind me of uh Vaughn is that the thing
[4465.58 → 4468.22] she's going to get my children wait does that mean i don't have a car
[4470.22 → 4480.70] uh you got me uh oh that could be a problem uh okay uh AMD Ryzen 7000 launching this fall it could be
[4480.70 → 4487.10] really fast up to 5.5 gigahertz with architectural improvements they're expecting a 15 single thread
[4487.10 → 4492.94] increase in cine bench uh given the clock speed the IPC gains look pretty small, but it'll be built on
[4492.94 → 4499.82] five nanometre TSMC more level 2 cache with some AI ship that has no actual details all desktop
[4499.82 → 4505.34] processors will come with an GPU Alex Clark puts i personally love this because it makes troubleshooting
[4505.34 → 4511.90] so much easier it is actually a really valid point that's i the only reason i think i that one's
[4511.90 → 4518.94] not a big deal for me what i love about it is just that AMD's onboard GPUs are freaking awesome so having
[4518.94 → 4525.10] a value option is something i wish we'd had two years ago but hey I'll take it now uh ddr5 no support
[4525.10 → 4533.82] for ddr4 it looks like um PCIE 5 with four more lanes than what we have on intel's latest platform
[4533.82 → 4540.38] support for up to 170 watt processors and in their keynote AMD showed a 16 core processor completing
[4540.38 → 4546.70] a blender render in 31 less time this is sort of a strange way to put it because it means that the CPU
[4546.70 → 4553.34] is 45 faster notes Alex it's entirely possible that AMD is being very conservative with their claims
[4555.50 → 4561.98] uh all right let's go ahead and talk about i fix it starting to fix it yeah this is super cool
[4561.98 → 4568.54] here they created uh I'm just going to share my screen real quick here because who did this for
[4568.54 → 4576.06] me Anthony young what a guy Anthony created a nice little list of solid lines you can buy and how much
[4576.06 → 4583.90] they cost now this looks like the pro move all right you buy the cheap one upgrade the storage DIY
[4583.90 → 4590.14] grab the 512 gig screen with the anti-glare etched glass and boom there you go maybe flip your standard
[4590.14 → 4595.34] screen one bay for someone who broke theirs that's looking like a pretty good value huh changing up
[4595.34 → 4600.38] the screen is a bit of an is a bit of an ordeal though, but it can be done yeah it should be noted
[4600.38 → 4605.90] if you were hoping to get a steam deck sooner by buying all the parts and putting it together yourself
[4606.94 → 4612.54] i would say that the cost probably doesn't make a ton of sense it's 400 that's for the 512 gig display
[4612.54 → 4618.54] but that doesn't include everything like not the SSD or a bunch of the buttons and the heat sink
[4618.54 → 4625.66] and stuff, so there are parts that um are not currently being sold just yet i fix it says that new parts
[4625.66 → 4630.70] will come back will come online in the next few weeks responding to out-of-stock parts by citing
[4630.70 → 4634.94] very high demand for their initial shipment of components it could be a good or a bad thing
[4634.94 → 4640.14] depending on your point of view right Anthony that's a very good point i fix its main issue with
[4640.14 → 4643.58] the steam deck is the inaccessibility of the battery that's something we talked about when we did a
[4643.58 → 4648.78] tear down of if it's glued in place and buried under flex cables another complaint was that the
[4648.78 → 4653.02] thumb sticks capacitive touch wires and the unit's USB-C board are soldered in place rather than
[4653.02 → 4659.66] modular those are relatively small though notes i fix it compared to other consoles and the deck is
[4659.66 → 4665.10] leagues ahead of the competition when it comes to transparency and repairable design choices so
[4665.10 → 4671.58] i mean it's sort of old news at this point, but good guy valve thank you very much for that are there
[4671.58 → 4679.42] any other headline topics we promised to talk about and haven't yet um i don't think so oh twitter
[4679.42 → 4686.54] find 150 million for misusing 2fa data uh twitter misused 2fa data of its users misrepresented its
[4686.54 → 4692.62] security and privacy practices profited off of user data misused phone numbers and other personal
[4692.62 → 4697.98] info to target advertisers and twitter used users 2fa phone numbers and email addresses to allow
[4697.98 → 4704.46] advertisers to deliver specific advertising to them, they violated a FTC order from 2011 that prohibits
[4704.46 → 4710.30] social media companies from deceptively using personal information twitter allowed users to use
[4710.30 → 4715.50] other multifactor authentication methods such as mobile authentication apps or security keys that do
[4715.50 → 4723.18] not require users to provide their telephone numbers they must notify users that it misused phone
[4723.18 → 4728.62] numbers and email as part of the suit i guess they must notify users that it misused phone numbers and
[4728.62 → 4734.38] email addresses collected for account security to also target ads to them and provide information about
[4734.38 → 4740.22] twitter's privacy and security controls here, and they must implement sorry okay go ahead no go for if it's
[4740.22 → 4748.38] fine here's what needs to happen okay there needs to be a centralized fund that these companies pay these
[4748.38 → 4752.62] fines into and the money needs to go to the end users if you're going to use my data i want to get
[4752.62 → 4759.82] freaking paid for it like what benefit is it to me that they then get a slap on the wrist that
[4759.82 → 4767.10] gets paid to like the same entity that wastes all my money so it can waste their money too like i i i
[4767.10 → 4773.82] don't I don't understand I'm the one who was harmed right am I not so why are they paying a fine to the
[4773.82 → 4779.42] government so what I'd like to see the government do is instead of just taking this money padding their
[4779.42 → 4787.34] pockets is i would like them to create a system by which these fines and i want i think it's like
[4788.06 → 4793.02] every time i think it's like whatever organization in the states i think it's the IRS goes after tax
[4793.02 → 4802.86] stuff sorry I'm not 100 on top of American things um yeah where they like fund themselves by catching
[4802.86 → 4808.06] people that are doing tax fraud things right i suspect this is a similar situation I'm assuming the
[4808.06 → 4815.66] fine goes to the organization that that caught them doing this well i don't know all right whatever
[4816.30 → 4820.62] basically I'm telling you guys how i think it should work i think the users whose rights
[4820.62 → 4826.14] were violated should get paid i think it should be way worse people are saying it's called a class action
[4826.14 → 4831.98] yes you could do that, but it's its a ton of work to organize it should just happen automatically like
[4831.98 → 4836.94] laws should matter and companies should be fined and people should just automatically receive the
[4836.94 → 4841.98] money like what year is it if all our personal information is going to be out there anyway it
[4841.98 → 4845.74] might as well be used for our benefit for a change give me my money
[4849.50 → 4856.30] that's my hot take for the day that's very wishful thinking Linus says twitch chat yes it is i know i just
[4856.30 → 4861.98] think like at 150 million dollars for all the users that twitter has you're going to get like five cents um
[4864.14 → 4869.34] but maybe both maybe the fine has to entirely cover the government's costs
[4869.34 → 4876.78] and also you have to like to pay whatever amount that you uh gained from users to the users that'd be cool
[4879.66 → 4884.30] um i don't know i think that's it for headline topics so child dude no says in the past few videos
[4884.30 → 4888.30] featuring the corsair 4000 you keep unscrewing the entire front part, yet you can just rip off the
[4888.30 → 4893.74] front panel, and you can just pull off the mesh it's been making me mad as someone who owns the 4000d
[4893.74 → 4901.34] okay I'll have to have a look at that um I've got an I've got a fan art to show firmware by jazz
[4901.34 → 4906.86] i don't think it's the greatest fan art, but it's a attempt was made so that's nice, thank you for that
[4908.86 → 4914.14] i don't I don't mean to be overly critical it's uh it's its good it's good it's good that you tried
[4914.14 → 4919.74] that was good uh we've got a few curated merch messages here uh just a reminder guys whether
[4919.74 → 4924.22] you're want to send a merch message or not we have free shipping on orders over 89.99
[4925.34 → 4932.86] we intended it to be for CPU ripper uh or excuse me what do we call it CPU rip like
[4932.86 → 4938.46] no tripper thank you we intend for it to be for the large size couch ripper or the large size team red
[4938.46 → 4944.86] pillow, but there's no actual way for us to limit it because of Shopify's stupid limitations so it's
[4944.86 → 4950.46] just on any order over 89.99 uh it should run until midnight tonight or Luke might pull the plug if it
[4950.46 → 4955.18] gets too bad but just telling you guys uh let's go through a few and then I'm going to have to I'm
[4955.18 → 4961.98] going to have to run i have like seven minutes from Ryan I've sort of become the unofficial tech advisor for
[4961.98 → 4966.46] my workplace i love helping, but it can be tedious at times any advice on how to politely educate on
[4966.46 → 4971.90] smaller issues without seeming like I'm trying to avoid helping documents knowledge bases yeah
[4972.70 → 4979.10] link them to link them to a video make it you know just say hey I'd love to help you with that
[4979.10 → 4985.90] but that's a little more involved than like basically you have to help them understand that they have to
[4985.90 → 4992.54] be willing to help themselves and if they're not willing to put the basic work into reading a FAQ or
[4993.10 → 4997.10] watching a video that helps give them a primer so that you're at least speaking the same language
[4997.10 → 5003.82] when you're trying to help them then you just got to say like hey you know i really need you to
[5004.62 → 5009.82] you know you there's got to be like a push and a pull here you know like i can't just be
[5009.82 → 5015.50] pushing all the information to you, you you got to be you got to be willing to educate yourself you
[5015.50 → 5020.70] know one of the things that was a big change for me is i used to try to respond to every email to our
[5020.70 → 5025.58] public email asking for tech support uh this was back like you know eight and a half years ago right
[5026.54 → 5030.06] when it wasn't such an incredible volume and i reached the point where i just couldn't do it
[5030.06 → 5035.18] every evening from the moment i got off work which was late to the moment i slept which was even later
[5035.18 → 5039.74] i would just sit and reply to tweets and i would reply to emails just like helping people with tech
[5039.74 → 5045.58] problems I'm like look at a certain point i made myself a template email, and it basically was just
[5045.58 → 5050.38] like look i can't do this anymore I'm sorry um you need to go post on the forum or something like
[5050.38 → 5054.86] that you got a crowdsource you got a crowdsource this information it's just not it's not tenable for
[5054.86 → 5060.54] me anymore and i would suggest something along those lines like point them to a good resource point them
[5060.54 → 5066.86] to r slash build a pc point them to Linus tech tips.com and if they and if they exhaust those resources you've
[5066.86 → 5074.86] provided, and they do not find a solution then okay you know fine fair enough maybe you can make some time to
[5074.86 → 5080.38] help them out, but they got to do they got to put the work in first you know what i mean okay I'm
[5080.38 → 5087.42] ordering my Uber now so bell do you mind locking up tonight of course okay thank you so much uh and
[5087.42 → 5093.66] then I'm just going to sprint out of here when when the car comes uh what's next oh sorry Luke
[5094.46 → 5099.66] i can finish up merch messages with bell okay cool well uh as soon as it comes I'll I'll go
[5099.66 → 5106.14] says it's going to be about eight minutes um from Odin's raven desk pads are awesome but my beautiful
[5106.14 → 5114.94] wife wants one in white nick and i talked about this today my concern and this is me being a
[5114.94 → 5120.94] total dinosaur executive is that if we make a white product you all are going to get coffee stains on them
[5120.94 → 5127.18] you're going to post pictures of your amazing setup with my white mouse pad in it, and it's going to look
[5127.18 → 5135.58] ugly, and it's going to be bad promotion for our in my opinion quality beautiful product and i had
[5135.58 → 5141.98] this argument with nick and Sarah back when we did the GPU wasteland one, and they got me to agree to do
[5141.98 → 5149.50] a light coloured mouse pad as a limited edition before we even received the finished units i had gotten
[5149.50 → 5155.90] Sarah and nick to do a complete 180 on it because Sarah had spilled coffee on hers twice, and it looked like
[5155.90 → 5162.38] ass so that's where I'm at on it nick brought it up to me again today and i said yeah I'll consider it
[5163.02 → 5169.90] but i just i just don't think people should buy it that's the ultimate problem is i don't want to
[5169.90 → 5175.58] make products that you're gonna i know you're going to eat your Cheetos you're going to drink your mountain
[5175.58 → 5182.70] dew okay i know it because I'm you I'm there all right you're going to ruin it, and it's, and then you're
[5182.70 → 5189.82] going to want a new one, and it's just more microplastics and more garbage in an already full of plastic and
[5189.82 → 5195.34] garbage world i would rather that we make something that you're going to use for 10 years than something
[5195.34 → 5202.38] that you're going to use for 10 months that's my stance on it and that's why we haven't done it
[5202.38 → 5207.98] it's not going to be like a lot of them says twitch chat there's also a lot of people saying just
[5207.98 → 5215.98] pre-coffee stain the mat but like rings of coffee mug on the mat could work uh i know it's going to be a
[5215.98 → 5220.46] lot of them, but we should go through any that are specifically addressed at Linus because he's going
[5220.46 → 5229.10] to head up oh my god it's not going to get here for 15 minutes I'm going to be so late okay I'll be
[5229.10 → 5234.78] fine everything will be fine from Jackson yes Jackson hi whatever happened to the gold Xbox
[5234.78 → 5241.74] controller and the diamond play button pc our potential buyer for the gold Xbox controller uh
[5242.70 → 5246.70] well got sort of screwed over by covid they wanted to come pick it up in person i can understand that
[5246.70 → 5253.18] I'd probably want to do the same thing so we haven't sold it yet which means it's still somewhere um
[5253.18 → 5260.06] um to be clear when i say somewhere i know where it is but not telling you exactly where it is because
[5260.06 → 5267.02] it's like kind of valuable and stuff so it's still somewhere um and if someone wants to buy it I'm open
[5267.02 → 5271.74] to it, you know you can get in touch it's not going to be cheap i consider it worth more than
[5271.74 → 5278.30] just the gold and i want to finally make some money on that project so there you go I'm being up front with
[5278.30 → 5284.38] you all as for the diamond play button pc it's still 100 works it's actually in my office on my test bench
[5284.38 → 5289.50] right now it's amazing it's so quiet and because of thunderbolt you can even put like a rip in GPU
[5289.50 → 5295.74] and it's freaking awesome from many people any updates on the screwdriver or backpack still aiming
[5295.74 → 5301.66] for the summer or any changes in that backpack has gone to fabric cutting which means that it is
[5301.66 → 5306.94] one step away from mass production all the testing with uh i think we use China it's the company
[5306.94 → 5312.78] that we use for our testing all testing passed with flying colours with respect to durability and
[5312.78 → 5319.50] uh water resistance so it is meets our goals internally actually for durability it blew our
[5319.50 → 5325.26] goals out of the water it's a freaking durable bag and so that is going into mass production should be
[5325.26 → 5329.66] this summer, but you never know the worldwide shipping is a mess that could be locked up i don't
[5329.66 → 5335.98] know you got what's the new what's the new disease uh monkey monkey monkey we got monkeypox
[5335.98 → 5343.50] right like i don't know man so it'll be when it is and as for screwdriver we should have the final
[5343.50 → 5350.54] fix to the ratchet next week we're pretty darn sure it involved a new mould so we weren't able we weren't
[5350.54 → 5356.06] able to fix it by changing the zinc housing we had to fix it by changing the mould for this little rocker
[5356.06 → 5362.78] inside it and with that new mould we should be able to enter mass production for those as well we've got a
[5362.78 → 5368.54] lot of parts already shot, so people might not realize this, but it actually qualifies to be
[5368.54 → 5375.82] labelled made in Canada all the plastics are been designed and shot here in Vancouver the actual um
[5376.78 → 5383.26] engineering was done here in Vancouver Richmond and Langley i think like all by companies within this
[5383.26 → 5387.58] region uh the patents are owned by mega pro who's a local company they're in port tells they're our
[5387.58 → 5393.10] neighbours uh the only thing that's being done overseas is the zinc housing for the ratchet and
[5393.10 → 5398.94] then i believe we're doing the shafts themselves uh are the bits done overseas okay i can't remember
[5398.94 → 5403.10] i think the bits might be in Taiwan and then i think the shaft and the zinc housing for the ratchet
[5403.10 → 5408.70] are done in China but um but yeah it actually because of the way the costing works out oh and
[5408.70 → 5413.26] the final assembly is all done here it actually qualifies as a made in Canada driver which is pretty cool
[5413.26 → 5419.90] what was I going to say where was I going right so a lot of it's actually done like a lot of handles
[5419.90 → 5424.78] are shot already and sitting waiting for assembly so as soon as the time comes we're going to be ready
[5424.78 → 5429.66] to rock boys, but it's going to take some time i think the capacity of the ratchet factory is like
[5430.86 → 5436.70] 30 000 units a month or something like that so we're gonna once we have that locked in we're
[5436.70 → 5444.30] going to go we're going to be ready all right from christopher sorry how do you feel
[5444.30 → 5451.18] about the firewall of firewall boxes i just got the firewall of gold amazed at how apple like
[5451.18 → 5456.54] they've made the firewall router without Wi-Fi it's the first user-friendly networking monitoring
[5456.54 → 5460.86] equipment i have never heard of it I'm sorry Luke have you ever heard of firewall
[5460.86 → 5471.98] you're muted dog mute king strikes again dude i did so good until the end ah uh no i haven't that
[5471.98 → 5479.90] was an it's quite a mouthful though yeah it's a cool name all right um from john what's a good
[5479.90 → 5486.62] four to eight bay NAS brand hmm you want the NAS build that we did recently in a john's bow case with
[5486.62 → 5492.78] your own computer in it because it'll be way better just run uh true NAS, and it'll be
[5492.78 → 5503.34] awesome that's what you want yes ask a DI ask a DIY person get a DIY solution from carter having
[5503.34 → 5507.26] recently wrote a research paper on passing right to repair legislation i was wondering if you think
[5507.26 → 5512.22] there's any situation where right to repair should not include third part third parties due to quality
[5512.22 → 5530.30] oh i see um or if first parties are responsible for a quality issue so no the first party just
[5530.30 → 5535.90] simply shouldn't be liable for anything that goes wrong with your self-repair i mean i think that much
[5535.90 → 5541.74] has been clear for many years i mean that's that's the reason why ford is not responsible if
[5541.74 → 5547.42] your local mechanic shop puts bad brakes on your car they're responsible yeah like this is already the
[5547.42 → 5554.14] the craziest thing about the whole right to repair argument is that we already had if it's already
[5554.14 → 5560.94] completely solved decades ago we just need to look to the automotive industry where yes they are required
[5560.94 → 5567.58] to produce service manuals, and they are required to support devices with replacement parts for some
[5567.58 → 5573.02] certain amount of time or facilitate the existence of these replacement parts like this is already a
[5573.02 → 5579.18] solved problem, so everybody shut up and do the solution we already have
[5582.06 → 5589.58] sorry okay not no, no no I'm calm I'm calm I'm not panicked at all about being late for this thing that
[5589.58 → 5597.90] I'm a guest at well to make you feel better we have another question from gather what's a product
[5597.90 → 5605.90] you wish you had reviewed when it was a relevant oh wow vita maybe that would have been pretty cool
[5605.90 → 5609.10] that's such a cool product and i just like i never shared any thoughts on it
[5612.62 → 5617.74] yeah i don't know I've just I've had kind of retro consoles on the mind so i uh
[5617.74 → 5623.42] i don't know what about you Luke what's something that would have been pretty cool i don't know I'm
[5623.42 → 5633.50] thinking wrt 54 GL the legendary oh yeah honestly that would have been sick yeah what a legendary
[5633.50 → 5642.30] product remember when links was cool yeah press normal folk what is that uh it's a router it was like
[5642.30 → 5648.22] the go-to router where the l at the end meant that it was Linux compatible, and you could run
[5648.22 → 5652.78] third-party firmwares which at the time was like a big deal and not that common that enabled all kinds
[5652.78 → 5659.18] of cool functionality like you could build a mesh network way back in like freaking the mid 2000s with
[5659.18 → 5664.78] these things way before like you know the kits you can buy today with like your home mesh setup or
[5664.78 → 5672.06] whatever like way back then like NCI's freaking Wi-Fi ran on wrt 54 GLS that were like zip tied into
[5672.06 → 5679.34] the rafters in the warehouse like that stuff was so op so sweet there's this sweet spot with technology
[5679.34 → 5687.18] um where like honestly for me, i don't want it to be too good because there 's's this sweet spot when
[5687.18 → 5693.74] it's still kind of bank, but you have an enthusiast core behind it that's really motivated and they
[5693.74 → 5699.90] make some stuff for it that's like really cool, and it still exposes a lot of it's a lot of the ways
[5699.90 → 5703.82] that it works, and you can tinker with it, you can do things, and it's awesome, but it's its performance
[5703.82 → 5707.26] enough that like when you get it in place, and it's done it's actually like a perfect experience
[5707.82 → 5713.26] that's the sweet spot dude when stuff is in that situation it's great, and you know that it's over when
[5713.26 → 5717.42] it's not really that fun to play with anymore because you can just set it and forget it and
[5717.42 → 5722.62] it's going to be fine anyway and that happens with like almost everything eventually it gets too good
[5722.62 → 5728.46] and then it's just like ah, but that's the fun of being on the cutting edge right it hurts a little but
[5728.46 → 5736.14] it's fun yeah yeah exactly like that that was an extremely fun era of like home networking oh for sure
[5737.34 → 5737.58] yeah
[5737.58 → 5744.86] relating to our game pass conversation reed asked where do you see gaming pricing going in the future
[5744.86 → 5749.58] when cloud streaming becomes a norm do you think we'll just pay for a subscription will you buy games
[5749.58 → 5755.10] or rent games i don't see the model changing much for the foreseeable future game pricing has been so
[5755.10 → 5761.98] stable for so long that i think it's pretty clear that if there was any way for the industry to push
[5761.98 → 5768.38] pricing up they probably would have done it there 's's whole like deeply analytical articles and
[5768.38 → 5776.06] videos about why games still cost 60 bucks um so i think you should maybe just explore that rabbit hole
[5776.06 → 5781.02] but i think that cloud streaming is ultimately not going to change that model because for the people
[5781.02 → 5788.22] that want to own a copy of the game as much as you can own a digital license in you know the game
[5788.94 → 5794.22] uh app store of your choice or whatever um i don't see why they would discount it any more than
[5794.22 → 5797.58] they already do and i don't see how they would get away with increasing the price if they haven't
[5797.58 → 5805.66] already so that's kind of my take on that from Joshua love the content what's your take on the new
[5805.66 → 5811.82] major browser exploits going around first chrome now Firefox I've been really busy um every day at work
[5811.82 → 5816.54] i do script reviews and meetings and shoot videos and then i go home and i work on setting up my house
[5816.54 → 5820.94] so i actually didn't hear about it sorry
[5823.50 → 5829.42] yeah I've been like sick and haven't really heard about this but yeah yep fair enough okay
[5832.46 → 5837.10] from Michael i just got a new job as a civil engineer in a large company how do i convince
[5837.10 → 5842.22] them that if you pay me over six figures providing monitors larger than 24 inches is probably worth the
[5842.22 → 5851.26] investment there is nobody at our company still stuck on 24-inch monitors that's stupid the amount
[5851.26 → 5859.10] that it costs for a 27 or better yet an ultra-wide particularly if you are working them spreadsheets
[5859.82 → 5866.78] is if it's like it the calculation for when the productivity is worth it is on the order of like
[5866.78 → 5873.10] weeks not months like the break-even point like that's you can send them this Michael
[5873.98 → 5879.10] it is so much faster and so much more efficient to get your work done when you have that extra
[5879.10 → 5885.18] stream screen real estate and for how little like a 27 or 32-inch monitor costs these days
[5885.98 → 5892.94] especially if you're a large company doing civil engineering um it's trivial it's trivial and a
[5892.94 → 5898.38] second monitor uh yeah you said monitors so I'm assuming that he has two but I'm just making sure
[5898.38 → 5904.14] there is productivity increases beyond two monitors they get pretty small, but they are
[5904.14 → 5908.62] there depends but if you have getting to that second order if you have like internal chat or tickets or
[5908.62 → 5913.26] something like that that kind of always need to be out it is i need a third monitor that's just the way
[5913.26 → 5919.34] it is you got your two for what I'm doing what I'm referencing and what i kind of need to be aware of
[5919.34 → 5925.10] yeah it depends and there are industries where you need like six to nine at like a minimum that's so
[5925.10 → 5930.70] it depends what you're working on but like for any random person almost no matter what you're doing
[5930.70 → 5933.90] getting a second monitor is an immediate massive improvement to productivity
[5937.18 → 5943.10] okay i must go you have to go i think that's the end of the merch messages anyway though
[5943.10 → 5949.82] oh nice awesome okay well hey that was a fun show thanks guys for tuning in we'll see you again next
[5949.82 → 5953.42] week same bad time same bad channel bye
[5960.54 → 5962.62] did you mock me sir yes i do
[5965.98 → 5972.46] uh okay uh bell i need to run to the sidewalk uh okay are you gonna all right here I'll turn off
[5972.46 → 5985.50] here
