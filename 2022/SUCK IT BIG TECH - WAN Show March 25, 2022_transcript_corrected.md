[0.00 → 4.88] what's up guys welcome to the wan show we've got a great show lined up for you this week
[4.88 → 12.24] the best man the EU digital markets act it sounds super boring but could be an absolute
[12.24 → 19.74] game changer actually spicy can you imagine sending a message from your signal app to
[19.74 → 29.16] someone else's I message app pretty crazy what else we got this week oh yeah Microsoft and
[29.16 → 38.64] OCTA were hacked by lapsus, but some arrests have been made yeah and uh the culprit isn't who you
[38.64 → 47.66] might have thought really well depending okay, but we'll talk about it, i 100 did but okay uh v7 fake
[47.66 → 54.24] profile AI detector actually sounds like it could be cool deep fakes are picking up pretty heavily
[54.24 → 58.84] lately there's been some really crazy ones and this should be able to detect them which is very
[58.84 → 63.70] interesting I think it's going to be this next one down here huh the one that I highlighted
[63.70 → 73.12] uh oh really yeah come on that's a main topic in it is it I thought the okay so Linus wants to shout
[73.12 → 81.84] out Ukraine selling invasion timeline NFTs uh which is another NFT topic NFTs for talking about every
[81.84 → 87.18] week despite not liking them maybe that's I mean that's fair enough I don't know I was going to say
[87.18 → 93.88] intel introduces new ATX PSU specs which is no i think Riley being a character in a video
[93.88 → 99.82] game yeah than that that's pretty cool that's awesome actually all right let's roll the intro sweet
[99.82 → 102.68] thanks, thanks yeah
[102.68 → 126.74] show is brought to you today by jump cloud back oh back blaze and dot tech okay that was a little
[126.74 → 134.86] broken good thing I read it out verbally yeah it works why don't we jump right into our first topic
[134.86 → 142.40] for the day which is of course lttstore.com haha got him okay but seriously though we have hair scrunchies
[142.40 → 149.52] now oh hey those are all right yeah lttstore.com okay no, but seriously our first topic of the day is
[149.52 → 159.32] the EU digital markets act this is a huge flipping deal the EU parliament on Thursday reached an
[159.32 → 166.98] agreement on a package of laws called the digital markets act to curb technology companies anti-competitive
[166.98 → 178.58] conduct it's so obvious okay oh man i I want to start a new takes no, no I want to start a new streak
[178.58 → 189.00] with no spicy take no you already did no, no, but it's just it is so infuriating dealing with apple
[189.00 → 196.94] apologists or really any big tech company apologists to be honest where they go oh but the benefits
[196.94 → 208.22] are no they told you the benefits are that the real benefits are this and that's it that's actually it
[208.22 → 219.18] and anyone who wants to try to justify like oh man the epic versus apple thing was one that was
[219.18 → 226.10] particularly frustrating because on Twitter people would just have these long back and forth that I'm
[226.10 → 233.96] tagged in, or they would send me these long tweet threads about how you know bad epic is and how
[233.96 → 241.46] they're only in it for the money and this and that, and it's like no you just obviously do not understand
[241.46 → 250.76] the issue anyone that argues against right to repair or free and open competition is just
[250.76 → 260.90] incorrect because if you are anyone other than a significant shareholder in that company or uh an
[260.90 → 268.10] executive of that company there is nothing in it for you there is literally nothing in it for you
[268.10 → 277.22] to anti-competitive behaviour you want competition the more the absolute merrier and apparently the EU
[277.22 → 283.28] parliament has figured it out which is kind of amazing because they certainly don't get everything
[283.28 → 287.66] right I would also like to say that it's its cool that this legislation is applying to what they're
[287.66 → 294.98] calling gatekeeper companies that have a value of over 75 billion euros or an annual sales of 7.5
[294.98 → 300.82] billion euros and 45 million monthly users uh and platforms
[303.14 → 308.90] that note and platforms is kind of odd well exactly where that's and platforms I think probably has a
[308.90 → 315.30] specific definition yeah just dropping it there floating is a little interesting but basically it
[315.30 → 320.18] seems like they're just trying to target actual big dog players yes which is kind of nice
[320.18 → 325.38] because some of these I think they shoot a little too low into companies that are still extremely in
[325.38 → 330.02] the small business range, and then it's like kind of rough for them to deal with it sometimes um but
[330.02 → 335.30] companies at that size of course they can absorb basically whatever so yeah sweet try to make the world
[335.30 → 342.18] better, so the proposed rules would require ensuring interoperability of their instant messaging
[342.18 → 348.18] services basic functionality I mean this is something this is something we should all be outraged
[348.18 → 353.78] but I think it didn't happen I mean uh was it leaked communication I think it was leaked communication
[353.78 → 359.22] from apple where they talked about interoperability between I message and other messaging apps
[359.22 → 366.66] and not doing it in order to increase friction for abandoning the iPhone yeah like to make sure
[366.66 → 373.30] that parents wouldn't buy nice shiny iPhones for themselves and cheap android kicker phones for their kids
[373.30 → 378.10] because to make sure that they have I message which has always been kind of baffling to me why
[378.10 → 384.58] anyone gives two hoots about I message yeah it was really cool for like a few months because you
[384.58 → 389.46] could send text messages over data every time we talk about it some people come out of the woodwork and
[390.18 → 394.90] tell us how stupid we are for not thinking I message is amazing yeah and then all the reasons that they list
[394.90 → 402.58] I'm like oh I don't care I could not possibly care less I don't know so we know and to be clear
[402.58 → 408.18] there's no way that it's only apple don't kid yourself oh yeah it's just an easy example because
[408.18 → 416.26] there was that leak especially now that they're all data-based not like in a database based on data
[416.26 → 423.86] rather than SMS okay especially now that they're all based on data there is absolutely no reason
[424.66 → 430.82] that they couldn't operate uh compatibly with each other there's going to be some weird stuff like uh
[430.82 → 437.86] apple has that like an emojis yeah for example if certain features so it well the thing is too though
[437.86 → 447.06] that if they are forced to be interoperable then apple could say okay look yeah the processing's on you
[447.06 → 453.62] but an animal is just a short video I'm not 100 certain yeah that's what it is okay
[453.62 → 459.46] so basically it scans your face with their 3d dot nonsense okay, and it's just and then and then yeah
[459.46 → 466.74] and so you can make facial expressions it records that and then sends it so apple probably
[466.74 → 472.98] has a like an abstract because they can assume that all the assets are available on the other
[472.98 → 479.14] device apple could probably do it with very little data transmission but if apple were to say okay yeah
[479.78 → 485.54] well we'll, we'll process it into a video, but it's on you to download and decode that video like
[485.54 → 490.58] that's your problem you store that on your servers that's a way that it could be interoperable i also
[490.58 → 495.14] wonder what to what degree they have to be interoperable because you could send a message
[495.14 → 500.58] but then have certain features not necessarily work because I'm sure live-streaming to someone
[500.58 → 508.18] from a discord chat to an I message chat would probably be pretty complicated but and like
[508.18 → 514.10] potentially sending an animal the other way efficiently might be kind of annoying or complicated
[514.10 → 519.86] or whatever as well, but you could send text messages which is the bulk of both of those
[519.86 → 524.90] platforms anyway so like does that count as interoperability they're technically working together
[524.90 → 529.78] just not full features um I think that would be fine personally
[530.90 → 536.34] blunder says every time someone SMS's me and tells me to use WhatsApp I reply via SMS and tell them
[536.34 → 545.30] I don't use Facebook slash meta services I mean yeah okay why don't you tell them to use telegram
[545.30 → 556.82] or signal then like the point is that you don't need I message nobody needs I message yeah uh okay also
[556.82 → 565.86] the ability to opt to use other safe app store alternatives that's huge that's exactly what epic
[565.86 → 571.86] games was going for with their lawsuit so if this goes through if apple was forced to open it up in
[571.86 → 581.70] the EU if nothing else legislators in other parts of the world would have to take another look at apple
[581.70 → 587.38] and google for that matter at both apple and Google's behaviour around their app store and play store yeah
[587.38 → 595.78] this would be sweet yeah uh the right to uninstall preloaded haps like this is just such an obvious
[595.86 → 603.70] list of things that no consumer should oppose I wonder, so this isn't just applying to phones right
[603.70 → 604.90] so this would apply to windows
[609.62 → 613.30] finally pretty interesting because Windows 7 is getting real gross
[613.30 → 617.86] it's to be honest it's almost like it's almost like the legislators
[617.86 → 624.98] the rules might be actual people who actually use these freaking products and have the same
[624.98 → 631.70] bloody frustrations that we do why do I have to have an app that I do not want
[632.82 → 637.62] there is no good reason for it other than f you Linus that's it
[639.22 → 640.74] I just lost the internet for a second but I'm back
[640.74 → 647.70] yeah the rules would require businesses to be able to access data that they generate now that
[647.70 → 653.86] one I'm not a hundred percent sure of the meaning of yeah me neither and why is it just businesses
[654.42 → 657.70] yeah because i I believe there's a certain amount of like you can request
[658.58 → 664.34] your data from platforms as a person was that not afforded to businesses that I don't know I'm not
[664.34 → 670.26] certain um advertising transparency with tools to verify ad reach okay that's super cool because
[670.26 → 675.14] I remember the handful of times that we played around with boosted posts on Facebook
[677.30 → 683.14] as far as we could tell there was just no real rhyme or reason to it sometimes you'd spend a little
[683.14 → 689.94] bit and get a lot sometimes you'd spend a lot and get a little and I just was like um okay and it almost
[689.94 → 695.38] just feels like they're taking uh like a behavioural conditioning approach to it where you spend a little
[695.38 → 700.98] bit, and it gives you a lot and kind of gets you yeah come on come on come on right
[700.98 → 705.70] because obviously it's in their best interest to optimize the amount of money that you spend on
[705.70 → 712.26] advertising and find that perfect balance where you won't stop spending money so it's effective enough
[712.26 → 717.38] but not too effective because well there's only a finite amount of inventory finite number of eyeballs so
[717.38 → 722.10] as so as someone who's been on both sides you've you've essentially bought advertisement through
[722.10 → 725.30] Facebook like you said and I know there's been purchase advertisement outside that I believe
[725.30 → 731.46] yep um and a big part of your business is creating content that gets ads on it do you think this will
[731.46 → 736.18] help because we've been talking for a long time about how YouTube has always been in this weird space
[736.18 → 741.38] where traditional advertisers are like podcasts yeah podcasts are great but then YouTube has just been
[741.38 → 744.98] like weird they don't really want to sponsor YouTube for some reason do you think this might help
[744.98 → 755.22] um no I don't think so because google and YouTube in particular already do a pretty excellent job of
[755.22 → 761.14] overall transparency but I mean this would apply to i shouldn't have been so hold on you can I
[761.14 → 769.46] clarify i it's not overall transparency with respect to advertising impressions and things like
[769.46 → 774.58] that at least on the YouTube side I know that there's been a lot of I know there's been a lot of
[774.58 → 780.58] nonsense around like you know you'd see websites back in the day that had like 25 banner ads at the
[780.58 → 786.90] bottom of them, and it's like way below the fold and nobody ever saw it like okay, okay sorry carry on
[786.90 → 791.86] yeah yeah um so I shouldn't have been so specific about YouTube because you guys make content on
[791.86 → 799.86] Instagram and ticktock oh yeah I guess Facebook and everything else do you think I doubt it I doubt it
[799.86 → 806.50] I think that influencer marketing is already pretty well accepted by most brands I mean there are
[806.50 → 812.90] exceptions I'd say that when you get into really like stuffy slow moving industries like i
[812.90 → 818.26] remember the first time we talked to a tool company or rather I should say I remember the first time we
[818.26 → 826.82] didn't talk to a tool company because they know just had absolutely internet what's that oh my
[826.82 → 833.86] as far as I could tell they were still sending PO's by mail like it was just ridiculous
[834.66 → 840.58] and I wouldn't be surprised you know YouTube who would watch YouTube lots of people right so
[842.98 → 849.62] i your successor yeah it's really hard to say I think you just have to wait for you know marketing
[849.62 → 855.22] summits and people to just kind of figure it out sure in time yeah I think it's reached a critical mass already
[855.22 → 863.94] um no more self-preferencing so google can't put shopping service at the top of each search results
[864.82 → 870.18] do that too much these days well they shouldn't do it at all they definitely sell a lot of search results
[870.18 → 875.70] way more than I feel like they did in the past I've started shifting to duck go yeah clearly because
[875.70 → 881.62] higher above the fold is just ads now google has become less efficient genuinely like I'm not
[881.62 → 885.14] necessarily switching there for privacy reasons or whatever else which is great and I'm happy that
[885.14 → 890.02] they have that but I'm switching because it's literally faster because the Google results are
[890.02 → 895.38] just yeah it's an entire page of sponsors really frustrating companies would also be barred from
[895.38 → 904.02] combining personal data for targeted advertising without consent wow platform owners can no longer
[904.02 → 910.18] require app developers to use certain services to be listed in app stores so that would include
[910.18 → 916.34] payment processors so you could use your own payment processor notably google is trialling allowing
[916.34 → 921.86] Spotify to use a third-party payment processor on the play store of course this shouldn't be a trial
[921.86 → 927.46] this should just be no you actually just have to do that if is they have the means to use their own
[927.46 → 933.94] payment processor then like yeah sweet it needs to be it needs to be open and competitive
[933.94 → 942.42] uh and allow app developers fair access to supplementary functionalities of smartphones this is a really
[942.42 → 949.94] interesting one and obviously there's going to be something more recent but I'm reminded of when I think it was
[950.98 → 961.94] the gyro in one of the very early iPhones that was locked off from developers early on do you remember that and there was a whole controversy around that
[961.94 → 968.58] I don't remember what part it was but i I do believe I remember this I don't know there's been a lot of way in show topics
[968.58 → 974.42] guys let us know let us know in the float plane chat if you can think of an example of a supplementary
[974.42 → 981.30] functionality of a smartphone that developers have not had fair access to and when you think fair access
[981.30 → 989.30] you could think of it in terms of that it is being monetized by the first party company in a way that third parties cannot compete with
[989.30 → 997.78] uh NFC on the iPhone says jacks yeah it has NFC on it, but apple's like that's our NFC
[999.62 → 1007.38] okay you don't get to use it yeah NFC that's a really great yeah really great example so stupid
[1008.02 → 1013.94] currently relevant yep, and they would have to inform the European commission of their acquisitions and
[1013.94 → 1019.94] mergers penalties for violations this is where things get fascinating so good this makes
[1019.94 → 1028.42] me so happy I don't know okay go for it could be as high as 10 percent of annual global revenues or even
[1028.42 → 1034.10] 20 percent for repeated infractions which is good because so many times when something happens its one
[1034.10 → 1040.66] of these companies they get the most minute slap on a wrist yeah that they like genuinely don't care
[1040.66 → 1047.06] about it reminds me of when like people shower some like super hyper rich person in praise for
[1047.06 → 1050.58] donating money to something, and then they do a calculation, and they're like oh if they have an
[1050.58 → 1056.98] average income this was like literally eight dollars, and it's like okay it's like it feels like that it's
[1056.98 → 1062.26] like oh they got oh my goodness Facebook got fined for a million dollars yeah it's like yeah Facebook
[1062.26 → 1067.78] doesn't care it's like you got you have to hit them harder made a million dollars while you were
[1067.78 → 1075.30] talking about it like it's yeah like you got you gotta get harder than that, so this is
[1075.30 → 1080.02] good this might mean it's actually enforced because a lot of things are just ignored because it's
[1080.02 → 1086.02] it's more convenient and sometimes literally cheaper to just pay the fee and that's stupid so I'm happy it's
[1086.02 → 1091.94] expensive wording of legislation is yet to be finalized there were a few things in here that felt a
[1091.94 → 1097.62] little vague so that probably makes sense uh it will be approved by the European Union parliament and council
[1098.66 → 1104.74] later I guess if past it would go into effect in October our discussion question here and
[1104.74 → 1110.58] honestly we'd love for you guys to join us in the chat and talking about this is which of those things
[1110.58 → 1117.62] are you most excited for honestly it's hard to decide they're all amazing I think because of my particular
[1117.62 → 1126.42] context uh being able to use like outside uh payment stuff in app stores is pretty huge because that's
[1126.42 → 1134.26] big for float plane in particular beef fire just outed themselves as um someone who doesn't get it
[1135.06 → 1138.42] more government control you'd think Canadians would have learned
[1138.42 → 1146.58] no this is a government body stepping in to reduce corporate control
[1148.82 → 1154.82] everything here is about loosening an iron fist
[1154.82 → 1165.62] how is it not clear like this is one of those things I just don't get it how can you oppose
[1166.82 → 1174.34] being allowed to remove crap you don't want from your devices when companies are valued in the hundreds
[1174.34 → 1179.86] of billions they have control over something and companies as a rule being forced to make their
[1179.86 → 1190.74] products interoperable how can you oppose pro consumer legislation because they won't do it on their own
[1191.30 → 1198.98] that is the role of a government to make sure that things are operating as they are supposed to for the
[1198.98 → 1212.18] benefit of the citizens come on oh i just i yeah i I can't other than the end platforms quote which we're
[1212.18 → 1217.86] still a little bit unsure about this is applying to companies worth uh with a value of over 75 billion euros
[1217.86 → 1228.10] yeah like good this is not applying to the average person exactly uh exactly silence brand
[1228.10 → 1235.86] skateboy208 says I'd like my rights back to own my device inside and out yeah a hundred percent a hundred percent
[1237.14 → 1245.14] it just makes me it makes me angry when people just buy into the propaganda like that and honestly i
[1245.14 → 1252.34] don't even necessarily blame the individuals like the right to repair the right to repair argument is so
[1253.22 → 1262.18] full of nonsense that it is legitimately really hard to filter out the BS yeah like you've got you've got
[1262.18 → 1268.82] companies talking about how it will it will destroy the very fabric of the universe if we is
[1268.82 → 1273.62] farmers allowed to fix their own tractors yeah which they've been doing forever and are perfect at it
[1273.62 → 1280.82] exactly man if you ever want to go down a rabbit hole make your way into farming YouTube
[1282.42 → 1291.54] it's nutting the kind of tech that some of these supposed you know hicks or whatever you take your
[1291.54 → 1300.58] your stereotypical farmer as portrayed in the media a lot of these folks are nothing like that they are as
[1300.58 → 1309.06] tech-savvy as anyone smart as a whip like just yeah i i I love it the kind of tech that is making food
[1309.06 → 1313.62] growing more uh more scalable than ever is just amazing one of the things I've always found
[1313.62 → 1320.90] interesting in that space is the mixture of kind of old and new tech so they'll take like old school
[1320.90 → 1327.30] non-computerized like this is like how the world works style like physics tech which farmers have
[1327.30 → 1332.10] been using forever, and they'll mix it with like monitoring pieces of software and all this type of stuff
[1332.10 → 1339.78] and it's just it's so cool I don't know I think it's awesome really smart stuff apparently Grossman
[1339.78 → 1346.98] recently uh uploaded a video about Maryland denying to even review a right to repair bill, and it's just
[1346.98 → 1352.58] just sickening yeah I mean you can just absolutely tell where legislators are in the pocket of
[1352.58 → 1360.26] these corporations and I don't understand why we are it's its especially frustrating when I see that
[1360.26 → 1370.82] it seems to be particularly one political group that gets furious about not having the right to do
[1370.82 → 1378.50] whatever they sometimes want but then doesn't worry about not having the right to do whatever they want
[1378.50 → 1384.02] in other cases, and it just seems to be the supplies of both sides exactly yeah exactly and so it's so
[1384.02 → 1389.30] if you're getting offended by this it, it's your probably self-reflect you're probably everyone
[1390.26 → 1396.10] um, and it's its just so frustrating because it's just how hard is it to have some consistency
[1396.74 → 1402.90] if you're is you're whether you're I'm just trying to think of examples for both sides so I can kind
[1402.90 → 1408.58] of cover my butt here uh you know what it's not coming to mind even do it yeah it's not coming to
[1408.58 → 1415.14] mind easily so I'm not going to bother but you should be just as outraged about not having the right to
[1415.14 → 1422.66] repair your device as you are about not having the right to anything else that is your personal property
[1423.22 → 1430.10] that's one of that's one of the foundational that's one of the foundational principles of western
[1430.10 → 1438.74] society like it's the right to own property it's its like right there it's a fun fact we
[1438.74 → 1443.30] actually don't have that like at all in Canada no which is interesting there's a few yeah
[1443.30 → 1447.94] there are a few things that I think a lot of Canadians think we have because they know the American law
[1447.94 → 1453.06] and then you look into Canada it's like oh nope not a thing yeah I love it
[1453.06 → 1460.66] uh i I don't love all of it I'll say that much yeah um so I haven't I haven't picked a regulation
[1460.66 → 1468.42] to be most excited about I think if I was trying to think big picture you know i would say oh
[1468.42 → 1475.30] yeah yeah it's you know the advertising transparency and tools to verify ad reach and companies being
[1475.30 → 1481.06] barred from combining personal data like you know like privacy things like that are really huge steps
[1481.06 → 1488.98] that would benefit people as a whole but if I'm thinking personally man i have to really like
[1491.30 → 1494.58] so there are some comments about that while you think about that there are some comments about the
[1494.58 → 1498.74] being able to use our own payment processor thing my ideal way to do it and actually how we mapped it
[1498.74 → 1505.62] out originally when we decided to make apps for flow plane was to have Apple Pay and Google Pay
[1505.62 → 1510.82] be a part of the payment processor suite in the app uh because to be completely honest it's just
[1510.82 → 1516.42] extremely easy to use them and some people would rather take the ease of use of being able to press
[1516.42 → 1521.62] essentially one button you'll just have it work uh but it's going to be more expensive because they are
[1522.18 → 1529.06] really expensive they are so expensive that we would literally make nothing if we use them because we
[1529.06 → 1536.82] try to not take too much um so it's just it's not feasible to use them now you know what if it came
[1536.82 → 1542.18] down to it, I would offer it as an option but it can't be the only option and we would have to scale
[1542.18 → 1548.42] up the price so that we still made some amount of money that isn't allowed um there's been some saying
[1548.42 → 1554.82] that it is allowed and then we do it and then we get taken off the store and then we get back up and
[1554.82 → 1558.98] then they call us and they're like hey but you're allowed to do it and I'm like hey but we did it and
[1558.98 → 1565.14] you blocked us and we end up in this infinite cycle forever so not really it doesn't really work at
[1565.14 → 1572.74] least not for us um so I don't know being officially allowed and have it be enforced by the EU would be
[1572.74 → 1576.74] cool because then we could have both options on the store and one is just going to be a little bit more
[1576.74 → 1581.14] expensive and we're not even going to scale it up we're only going to scale it up by exactly the
[1581.14 → 1585.78] amount of difference that it costs us for us to use that service that's it we're not going to try
[1585.78 → 1592.18] to profit more off of those things um but it does cost us more to use them so it'll cost users more
[1592.18 → 1596.50] to use bacon dragon points out this isn't even all they have they're working at a sister bill
[1596.50 → 1602.02] digital services act so watch out for that uh it's child says does this have anything to do with
[1602.02 → 1610.82] anyone not living in Europe absolutely any time you see momentum it will build once you've got these
[1610.82 → 1620.18] kinds of consumer rights in Europe the excuses that companies like apple and google and Microsoft
[1620.18 → 1627.46] can come up with to continue to behave in an anti-consumer manner start to run out pretty quickly
[1628.42 → 1636.82] you know how do i as as a spokesperson for one of for Facebook how do i with a straight face
[1636.82 → 1645.22] stand there and speak to an American legislator or a member of the public or uh media outlet and say
[1645.22 → 1653.70] oh yeah we simply couldn't do x when it's already working across the ocean completely fine because it
[1653.70 → 1659.46] will it's not worth it for them to completely pull out of a market the size of the EU which is one of the
[1659.46 → 1665.46] things that can be very powerful about a block like that to be clear I'm not saying that it's uh perfect
[1665.46 → 1670.90] I'm just saying that it can be a benefit quick clarification someone asked when you talk about
[1670.90 → 1674.98] Apple Pay and Google Pay you mean purchases through the app store and Google Play Store right well no
[1674.98 → 1680.58] they shouldn't be synonymous that's the whole point, but that is what I mean is purchases through the
[1680.58 → 1685.86] store i I understand there's you can use whatever but yes I'm talking about through the store they have
[1685.86 → 1692.10] specific pricing for that um also someone pointed out like twitch has higher pricing on their app than on
[1692.10 → 1698.26] their website it's like yeah when I try to appeal it I am not allowed to use examples of other
[1698.26 → 1704.66] apps that do it the other way it is I'm specifically not allowed when they called me I brought it up
[1704.66 → 1709.30] because I'm like I have you on the phone so I can say whatever I want and I listed like a bunch of
[1709.30 → 1712.82] different apps that do it the right way, and they're like well we'll look into that and I'm like to be
[1712.82 → 1718.74] clear I'm not trying to get them in trouble it's just clearly a double standard giant billion dollar
[1718.74 → 1728.26] company can do what they want, and we can't yet again problem annoying oh man uh Loki uh 1119 says
[1728.26 → 1735.62] you didn't mention that apple's response to uh you didn't mention apple's response that safari is an
[1735.62 → 1743.38] essential part of iPhone functionality it sure as heck isn't manned that Microsoft has tried that argument
[1743.38 → 1748.10] so many times why do they get away with it why does anyone get away with it no it's an app it's a web
[1748.10 → 1754.42] browser that's what it is so frustrating you can browse I can't pick a favourite one I'm
[1754.42 → 1758.82] having a really hard time with this you know what I'm going to go with the right to uninstall preloaded
[1758.82 → 1764.90] apps there that enhances my privacy because there's no reason for any of those apps to phone home
[1765.46 → 1771.54] it declutters my device I like it a lot I like that one I think it's a big it's just that one in
[1771.54 → 1780.10] particular is just so black and white cut and dried obvious that nobody should object to it if you object
[1780.10 → 1785.78] to it, I don't know what to tell you I would probably more strongly consider moving off of pixels if that
[1785.78 → 1791.54] was a thing yeah for sure because that's been my biggest I hate that stuff and that's pushed me away
[1791.54 → 1797.22] from using other phones a lot uh Conrad mentioned in twitch chat uh twitch subscribe is five dollars
[1797.22 → 1804.26] Canadian on desktop, and it's seven dollars and ninety cents Canadian on mobile that's the type of
[1804.26 → 1812.98] scale we're talking about yeah the app payments are rough dudes it's its like not okay delving says
[1812.98 → 1820.74] Samsung forcing the installation of one drive when Samsung cloud closed was so annoying agreed
[1821.54 → 1830.50] agreed man oh it's too bad that the ensuring interoperability bit oh it's its too bad that's
[1830.50 → 1837.22] only instant messaging services because how awesome would it be if apple was forced to allow you to
[1837.22 → 1845.14] back up your iPhone to Dropbox or Google Drive or Google Drive or whatever you want why do they have
[1845.14 → 1850.02] the right to tell me where I can put my data they shouldn't, it doesn't make any sense
[1851.54 → 1857.46] and don't tell me oh boohoo apple needs their cloud revenue in order to survive no they don't
[1857.46 → 1863.22] they're doing fine, and they would do fine without it and if they actually had to compete then it would
[1863.22 → 1869.14] be a benefit for everyone because your iCloud backup would have to be competitively priced stop simping
[1869.14 → 1875.62] for a billion and what if I don't want what if I don't want a cloud backup what if I just want to back
[1875.62 → 1886.98] up to my NAS at home more interoperability is good it's good it's great we should always agree with
[1886.98 → 1895.06] more interoperability and more open standards cool steely boy in flow plane chat says what about online
[1895.06 → 1901.54] retailers that charge a service fee for using a new payment method i.e. adding a new card I've literally
[1901.54 → 1908.66] never heard of I have never heard of that before I don't even know if that's a thing I've never how
[1908.66 → 1919.62] would that even work uh anyway huh okay should we move on yeah yeah let's move on let's talk about
[1919.62 → 1926.10] the uh the lapsus arrests you want to talk us through this one Microsoft and OCTA I've never actually tried
[1926.10 → 1932.90] to pronounce that uh out loud before so I'm going to say OCTA hacked by lapsus uh some arrests have been
[1932.90 → 1938.58] made sort of we'll talk about that in a little bit on Monday evening lapsus stated on their telegram
[1938.58 → 1944.82] channel that they gained access to some of OCTA's proprietary data uh OCTA's CEO Todd McKinnon said that
[1944.82 → 1950.50] the uh data is from a hack that was from two months ago the matter was investigated and contained by the
[1950.50 → 1956.26] sub processor, and he said that it was no breach of the company's service it was through a support
[1956.26 → 1964.82] engineer's laptop they got limited access to data lapsus disagrees is the short firm answer uh
[1964.82 → 1971.54] they're claiming that the that OCTA is downplaying the severity of the breach which in this scenario
[1971.54 → 1977.22] could be terrible um they're saying that they were able to log into a superuser portal with the
[1977.22 → 1986.26] ability to reset the password um and multifactor authentication of roughly 95 of clients um oh
[1986.26 → 1995.62] that's terrible a massive oof um Cloudflare CEO Matthew price has stated that they are aware of the
[1995.62 → 2000.10] compromise and will be or sorry that they are aware of the yeah compromise, and they will be resetting
[2000.10 → 2006.42] OCTA credentials of employees who have changed passwords in the last four months uh we don't use this
[2006.42 → 2014.18] at any of the things just so you know um yeah also, also on Monday lapsus posted a bit torrent link to
[2014.18 → 2022.34] an archive purportedly containing a source code for bing maps and Cortana this group is just going
[2022.90 → 2030.10] nuts over the last little while it's been crazy does anybody want the source code for bing how not to
[2030.10 → 2040.82] create a dumpster fire oh my um okay anyway bleeping computer reported that there are 37 gigabytes of
[2040.82 → 2048.66] source code that's a lot of code that's a lot of code Microsoft says we are aware of the claims
[2048.66 → 2052.98] and investigating which is very non-committal, but that is what it is that's what it's going to be
[2052.98 → 2057.70] on Thursday it was reported that seven suspects aged, so this was the part you're surprised yeah I was
[2057.70 → 2064.10] surprised I am not at all okay fine yeah on Thursday it was reported that seven suspects aged 16 to 21
[2064.10 → 2072.82] 16. yeah, and like pwning Microsoft and NVIDIA yeah absolutely uh they were arrested in London and later
[2072.82 → 2077.46] released while the investigation continues that's why I said the sort of part they have been released at
[2077.46 → 2085.54] this time uh the main notable character is a 16-year-old from Oxford the online tag being white or breach
[2085.54 → 2093.78] base uh who has allegedly accumulated over 300 BTC through hacking activities such as sim swapping
[2094.34 → 2101.86] they were hacked twice apparently and gambled a bunch losing most of it um they were ousted apparently
[2101.86 → 2109.06] by rival hackers who posted uh private photos of white with their family along with name address
[2109.06 → 2116.66] date of birth and education also known as white got doxxed yeah lapsus has stated that they might be
[2116.66 → 2120.66] quiet for a while as some members are going on vacation until the end of the month
[2122.98 → 2125.94] vacation you say at a party van um
[2128.82 → 2133.86] uh okay discussion question is who's next should we make a betting pool at this point
[2133.86 → 2141.54] they're just cleaving everybody who knows it could be anyone this group is crazy um they're on
[2141.54 → 2147.70] they're on quite a terror i I don't remember anything like it this is pretty legendary I'm not gonna I'm
[2147.70 → 2152.90] not gonna lie okay don't glorify it i legendary doesn't mean good just like how great doesn't mean
[2152.90 → 2162.10] good it's a scale okay a scale is, but we all agree that halo is best on legendary
[2162.10 → 2169.46] so I think there's a connotation there okay, okay I don't mean by that I don't mean good but the
[2169.46 → 2177.14] it's its impact is very large they're they're hitting many things, and they're hitting them very
[2177.14 → 2184.18] hard they're they're hacking many Gibsons yeah okay all the Gibsons all the Gibsons yeah unreal
[2184.18 → 2193.22] I am very interested in this fake profile AI detector we really needed something like this
[2193.22 → 2200.74] and I hope competitors crop up and I hope it becomes a big thing because like so check out this
[2200.74 → 2208.66] profile you know to the human eye this looks pretty for perfectly legit right okay that seems like
[2208.66 → 2213.38] a pretty good quote got lots of connections including some mutual connections would I click accept if
[2213.38 → 2219.62] someone had multiple mutual connections and looked like fairly real like this yeah maybe, but this is
[2219.62 → 2228.98] just an AI generated random person from bits of averaging bits of other people pretty much is what
[2228.98 → 2237.54] we're looking at here and these kinds of fake profiles have become a real problem so it's could be
[2237.54 → 2245.22] bots trying to sell you something or much worse so Alberto Tripoli co-founder and CEO of v7 labs uh reached
[2245.22 → 2250.82] out to us about a Chrome extension that his team developed to help combat this problem it's not enough
[2250.82 → 2256.74] meat for a full LTT video, but we definitely did want to talk about it and share it with you guys
[2257.30 → 2265.22] the extension can apparently quickly determine with greater than 99 certainty whether a profile picture was AI
[2265.22 → 2272.98] generated that's pretty insane that is so cool that's cool they don't to be fair these accounts
[2272.98 → 2278.90] don't only use AI generated profile no but when it's not an AI generated profile picture it's a lot
[2278.90 → 2284.74] easier to do a reverse google image search and find out okay am I being catfished let's say in a dating
[2284.74 → 2292.90] context or you know is this person does this model actually know that someone is using their profile
[2292.90 → 2298.58] picture on LinkedIn or whatever very easily end up being a feature of this service or a competing
[2298.58 → 2306.74] service in the future yeah where they go hey this photo is used by this many other profiles these other
[2306.74 → 2314.98] profiles uploaded it first maybe take a glance at this for an example of how these uh you know these AI
[2314.98 → 2321.54] generated people don't necessarily look weird and uncanny valley we're going to head to this person does not
[2321.54 → 2330.10] exist dot com you can generate a random human face in one click and downloaded it all are AI generated
[2330.10 → 2336.74] fake person photos man woman or child check this out would you know that that is not a real person
[2338.02 → 2344.66] nope she looks like an inmate but other than that looks real to me because they have an orange guy looks
[2344.66 → 2351.38] like every tech bro programmer ever the most generic tech bro of all time
[2353.30 → 2357.94] yeah I've done this before, and it's its kind of stunning I mean happy graduation right when i when
[2357.94 → 2363.30] I first heard about this I was just like there 's's no way and I did a bunch of reverse image
[2363.30 → 2367.22] searches on like a ton of them because I was like they have to just be scraping this from somewhere but
[2367.22 → 2378.10] yeah they're generated it's how real does she look yep pretty real like even got little subtle asymmetry
[2378.10 → 2383.78] and like the lines around the eyes and stuff like that it's madness
[2386.90 → 2392.98] oh it's taking a minute this time this is actually I think a bunch of people are hitting the site yeah oh
[2392.98 → 2401.54] guys okay you know what would she think of this okay wait we just got the same one what no
[2403.86 → 2404.18] whoa
[2407.70 → 2415.70] whoa I guess they did them like ahead of time they must have yeah all right there you go yeah Luke
[2415.70 → 2421.70] are you is your screen still up yeah yeah Luke and i both have the same AI generated person I wonder if
[2421.70 → 2428.34] there are any differences doesn't look like it oh that's pretty funny all right cool oh
[2428.34 → 2438.66] oh sorry way to be Luke sorry now one problem that I foresee with the v7 fake profile AI detector
[2438.66 → 2445.78] is that one of the most um I don't know if effective it's very effective and pretty well understood now
[2445.78 → 2450.98] uh one of the most well understood ways of tackling a machine learning problem
[2450.98 → 2458.02] is using what's called adversarial neural networks where you will in order to make your fake
[2458.90 → 2466.02] less easily detectable you will actually create another opposing AI that is designed to detect your
[2466.02 → 2473.70] fake and that will improve the abilities of your fake so if they're 99 effective
[2474.42 → 2482.58] wouldn't a great way for me to improve my fake profile picture generator be to spit out a thousand
[2482.58 → 2489.06] ten thousand a hundred thousand a hundred million profile pictures find out what works about the one
[2489.06 → 2496.02] percent of them and then eliminate whatever isn't working about the rest using this extension it's not
[2496.02 → 2502.74] like v7 or any potential competitors would just fold at that time though it is becomes an arms race at that
[2502.74 → 2510.34] point and so far it's mostly been uh an arms race with one side and now there are two sides which is good
[2511.62 → 2512.26] that's about it
[2514.34 → 2519.62] yeah apparently the page has overload protection and we absolutely hit it whoops sorry my bad

[2675.46 → 2684.34] today using the link down below I want to talk about our new items on lttstore.com sure all right
[2684.34 → 2693.06] so would you describe yourself as too wet right now uh yes, yes all right do I ever have the solution for you
[2695.62 → 2702.90] oh you'll be far you'll, you'll be far less wet as soon as I do this gosh yeah oh stop okay but for reals
[2702.90 → 2713.46] if you are too wet the towels try a LTT store towel I genuinely didn't see that coming I was trying
[2713.46 → 2719.86] to beat you to it, I loaded up the store and saw it on the store oh that's nice yep only the finest
[2720.42 → 2727.46] the finest cotton towels we've got them in three different sizes we've got the small for small
[2727.46 → 2736.10] towel needs we've got the uh the medium for medium towel needs uh you want to hold up I think
[2736.10 → 2740.58] you've got the medium you want to I mean I guess go back there a bit or something I don't know you
[2740.58 → 2747.78] can you can help, help model the towels it's pretty big I can't tell that might be the big one okay I think
[2747.78 → 2752.10] this is probably the medium one then yeah that's that's definitely the large one
[2752.10 → 2759.94] uh yes so that's the medium size one I mean that one's also pretty big I don't know Lloyd likes big
[2759.94 → 2766.66] towels so we went with big towels they've got kind of a short circuit actually huge yeah it's its more
[2766.66 → 2774.58] of like a beach towel at that point it's got like a short circuit inspired kind of thing here and then I think
[2774.58 → 2782.10] he was kind of going for like a GPU or something like that's like the slot or something it doesn't matter
[2782.10 → 2788.02] the point is the cool towel very absorbent, and we've got a variety of colours hey Luke check out this colour
[2789.86 → 2795.70] nice and this colour that's the same colour it's the same colour just chill nice
[2797.06 → 2804.18] does this one have a different edge uh I don't know oh it's just the huge yeah yeah it's the beach towel
[2804.18 → 2809.78] one that's like edentulous the beach towel one has like a tougher feeling yep it's more of like a
[2809.78 → 2816.58] it's more of a blanket oh no it's just the one end of it oh all right never mind okay never mind
[2816.58 → 2826.18] so uh where is it here yep we've got orange and green the small one is 14.99 and the big ones are both
[2826.18 → 2833.78] 19.99 we've got the dimensions on the store you can see them here they're yep they're towels so
[2833.78 → 2841.86] 100 cotton very absorbent when you do your uh your hot tub stream you'll have a towel yeah for
[2841.86 → 2850.02] sure for sure once I've got a hot tub we did by the way try to do a more vibrant orange and that's
[2850.02 → 2857.06] just part of the product development process around here we got a lot of orange dye on a lot of things
[2857.06 → 2866.34] so these were as vibrant as we could make them while not having them bleed ridiculous amounts of
[2866.34 → 2872.82] of dye that makes, so these will be these will be I'd say your first wash I would wash them in your darks
[2872.82 → 2880.02] and maybe the first couple and then after that it should be fine so there you go guys oh man uh
[2880.02 → 2888.90] sidetracks says can we have a demo you do have a water bottle yes that's fair um uh intel on float
[2888.90 → 2893.62] plane says I love the eco packaging for the cable ties but I worry about greenwashing will you make
[2893.62 → 2898.42] a commitment to be carbon-neutral by a certain year you guys set a good example in terms of employee
[2898.42 → 2902.98] treatment and ethics would love to see you set an example of climate change so the thing about carbon
[2902.98 → 2910.82] neutrality is it's really difficult to measure for us, it's not about greenwashing its more about
[2911.46 → 2920.26] just doing whatever is obvious that we can do to me just not having excess plastic in your packaging is
[2920.26 → 2927.86] just obvious it doesn't actually cost a lot more so why not something recyclable so two things just in
[2927.86 → 2931.06] case you're like me and didn't know what greenwashing was greenwashing is the process of conveying
[2931.06 → 2934.90] false a false impression of providing misleading information about how a company's products are
[2934.90 → 2941.22] more environmentally sound second question to be combative why those in plastic bags that's actually
[2941.22 → 2946.34] a good question why are these in plastic bags because someone I think it was Jake brought that up when
[2946.34 → 2952.42] those were first and those might even be the first demo samples and maybe their packaging has changed
[2952.42 → 2958.90] yeah let me find out because I remember having a conversation about that um I know that our goal is by the
[2958.90 → 2965.54] end of this year to have no, no plastic in our packaging and shipping materials
[2973.06 → 2977.06] hopefully you guys can are going to be able to hear nick it's coming through I can hear my headphones
[2977.06 → 2977.54] okay cool
[2977.54 → 2982.42] oh
[2983.14 → 2987.14] oh I'm being ignored call screening
[2990.18 → 2995.30] you have reached mailbox number oh yeah I wasn't sure if it was going to say its phone number or
[2995.30 → 3002.98] something that was close all right well I didn't manage to get in touch with nick I know that um
[3002.98 → 3011.06] I know that there's no reason they shouldn't be shippable like this we'll have to figure that out
[3011.54 → 3016.90] I will find that out for you guys and I promise that the second shipment will not have plastic on it
[3016.90 → 3021.30] if those were the same samples we had when we first showed them off forever ago then that's how they
[3021.30 → 3026.02] were originally handed to us, and it was said that they were still working on the packaging oh, oh Nick's
[3026.02 → 3035.70] calling uh hey Nick yeah uh you're live on wan show uh we had someone ask about the plastic packaging on
[3035.70 → 3044.66] the scrunchies yeah um is it didn't we get rid of the plastic or are these still the early
[3044.66 → 3051.54] samples uh I believe there was miscommunication with the supplier, and it's going to be fixed on the next
[3051.54 → 3057.14] round that we do it but yeah I think those are present on the current round got it okay all right
[3057.14 → 3064.58] okay thank you what is it going to be uh what will the new solution be uh they'll probably just be
[3064.58 → 3069.86] loose in whatever the know the pack is that we send to the customer okay, and maybe they just throw
[3069.86 → 3078.66] a staple in the top of it so that the scrunchies don't fall off the board uh something like that
[3078.66 → 3083.86] uh well email me and I'll make sure we follow up on it next week okay thanks nick all right
[3083.86 → 3084.74] thank you okay bye
[3088.34 → 3100.26] all right Mr Schwab says i um Mr Schwab says I heard artesian builds bought out Linus media group is that
[3100.26 → 3107.46] true no that's yes definitely not true I'm just going to email nick real quick here now if you want to
[3107.46 → 3114.26] send in a merch message you have to have over 5 000 so followers on all socials what oh stop
[3117.30 → 3126.66] stop I'm kidding enough it's a joke enough all right uh
[3128.02 → 3132.74] speaking of which should we do some merch messages yeah we probably should we do one more topic
[3132.74 → 3138.50] for oh no we should definitely do some merch messages oh there are some curated ones sweet shadow
[3139.94 → 3146.18] ed dinner like it doesn't matter the point is finally got a 3080 excited to try these towels can't
[3146.18 → 3150.42] wait for screwdriver and backpack are there any other products on the horizon you're super excited about
[3150.42 → 3158.42] that you can hint at slash spoil uh we're working on pants like tech pants like kind of cargo-y pants
[3158.42 → 3166.02] okay those I'm really excited like you have sweatpants, and we're working on a
[3167.62 → 3173.38] what's something else that's really cool that I can kind of spoil we're getting kind of close enough
[3173.38 → 3179.78] that if I don't give any details it shouldn't give our competitors any hints, but we are working on a really
[3179.78 → 3187.54] cool cable management project okay I can't give any more detail than that has there been movement on
[3187.54 → 3192.82] that oh lots oh sweet lots it's been a long time since we talked about it, but that's exciting lots of
[3192.82 → 3202.02] movement uh most of the designs are final or near final so we're going to move into moulding like creating
[3202.02 → 3210.66] moulds and I have given I've given rough quantity guidance to the team anywhere from about 30 000
[3210.66 → 3218.10] units all the way to a hundred thousand units of each thing, so this is going to be yet another
[3219.46 → 3229.38] million dollar bet big push let's go yeah yeah i um oh man this is less of a new product and more of
[3229.38 → 3236.26] just a business update but i had some floor time some floor time in my office yesterday yeah
[3236.26 → 3241.30] nick came in to talk to me about backpack no one gets to see my floor time I have four time these
[3241.30 → 3248.42] days do you have floor time it's interesting yeah the thing is I find, and maybe it's BS but I find
[3248.42 → 3258.18] sometimes i just I can't think about something unless I take away the gravitational blood flow limitations and
[3258.18 → 3267.06] just I need to lie down you know 100 of all effort needs to go into brain so I had some floor time
[3267.06 → 3276.26] because Nick came in talking to me about our order quantities for backpack so far we have 9 000 people
[3276.26 → 3285.22] signed up for a notification when it comes in stock now I don't expect a 100 conversion on that no but i
[3285.22 → 3291.30] expect a pretty strong conversion pretty good and when we initially scheduled out our PO with the
[3291.30 → 3299.46] supplier we scheduled it out 10 000 then a two-month gap another 10 000 for delivery and then a two-month
[3299.46 → 3307.86] gap and then another 10 000 for delivery so we would have 30 000 over a span of four months and in that
[3307.86 → 3312.26] four months they would all arrive and then presumably they would last for a little while after that
[3312.26 → 3322.90] okay based on that 9 000 notification number I'm freaking out a little bit because we only have the
[3322.90 → 3331.06] first shipment if all goes well oh by the way this is the final one oh I have the newest sample I got it
[3331.06 → 3338.82] this week this one is almost final the only thing that's not final no, no we're not getting another sample
[3338.82 → 3348.82] though oh, so there's one small not final thing, and it's that in one of these little um like accordion
[3348.82 → 3355.06] fold things here we're going to put a small pocket on the inside for an air tag just a little yeah you
[3355.06 → 3360.02] mentioned that to put an air tag in their yeah so it's its not going to be hidden, but it's also
[3360.02 → 3366.10] not going to be obvious it'll be kind of tucked away and there are other places you could kind of stash it
[3366.10 → 3372.50] as well but other than that this is final, so the colour on the zipper pulls is now correct the uh
[3372.50 → 3379.22] mechanism for the luggage strap attachment thing is now these loops instead of the metal buckle things
[3379.22 → 3384.90] I like that a lot we've also got uh what else changed oh yeah the screwdriver pocket
[3386.98 → 3392.02] now has a compatibility function so if you don't want to put a screwdriver in it, you accidentally put
[3392.02 → 3396.50] something small in it, we realized you couldn't get your fingers down there to get it out oh so
[3396.50 → 3400.82] we just put a zipper here so you can get into the bottom of the that's actually kind of cool yeah i
[3400.82 → 3406.34] like that not the stupidest thing we've ever done why not um if you threw not that screwdriver in it
[3406.34 → 3410.26] and the bit like fell out or something yeah being able to get it would be nice one other not final
[3410.26 → 3416.58] thing this Linus tech tips word mark here is going to go okay so that and the AirPods pocket are the
[3416.58 → 3422.66] major changes' oh we deepened these pockets here for that I use for my mouse and my cable they're
[3422.66 → 3430.58] deeper now, and then we also deepened uh these pockets that I use for my battery bank and my
[3430.58 → 3435.30] charger to make sure that they're compatible with larger chargers for anyone unsure of what he's talking
[3435.30 → 3442.50] about in regard to the notification uh we put up I believe it was last week uh two pages one for
[3442.50 → 3447.46] backpack one for screwdriver and their way that you can sign up for a direct notification email
[3447.46 → 3453.46] notification um when those products are finally available for purchase yeah so here's the problem
[3454.58 → 3461.22] the lead time for production is 90 days if all goes according to plan we get our first 10 000 units
[3461.22 → 3468.10] in early August so manufacturing terms lead time that's before they would start making it right uh that
[3468.10 → 3476.66] is from the moment we say go to them putting it on a container putting it in a container so it's
[3476.66 → 3481.22] finished in that actually no I think nine noes I think 60 days is the production time and I believe it's
[3481.22 → 3487.78] another like 30 days for shipping or something like that so 90 days should be the time from press go to
[3487.78 → 3493.78] it arrives and that assumes no delays at the ports which have been weeks in some cases, so 90 days is my
[3493.78 → 3500.82] best case scenario when I decide I want more bags my first shipment is going to hit me early August if
[3500.82 → 3509.14] all goes perfectly according to plan that's prime back to school time okay I only have 10 000 bags and
[3509.14 → 3516.42] I have 9 000 people signed up according to the original plan my next round of backpacks was going to hit me
[3516.42 → 3524.42] early October with another round September October November early December for holiday season right
[3525.38 → 3531.06] but that's it that's all we'd have for the entire year and basically as far as I can tell the back
[3531.06 → 3536.74] would the backpack would just be completely out of stock for the entire year here's the other problem
[3536.74 → 3546.90] if i need more of them this year I pretty much have to decide before I get to see a single unit
[3546.90 → 3554.02] sell yeah the other problem yeah that's that's concerning every 10 000 units of backpacks is a
[3554.02 → 3564.74] seven figure bed anyone scary yeah anyone talking about how the backpack is unreasonably priced
[3564.74 → 3571.86] or whatever you don't understand how much it costs to make a really high quality bag it just costs a lot
[3571.86 → 3581.06] and so every single one of those chunks is a seven figure bet that we either win or we lose right so
[3582.66 → 3591.30] I'm uh yeah I'm so you happy you did notifications or no I don't know man i we're we're going to ask the
[3591.30 → 3596.74] factory to step up those later those okay here's another problem would you like a straw poll to
[3596.74 → 3600.98] ask people like if you sign up for the notification do you intend to buy or are you just interested
[3600.98 → 3605.06] it's not gonna I don't think it's going to tell us anything really it's so easy to say yeah I'm
[3605.06 → 3610.82] considering it right like I don't know and here's another problem i guess the question would be
[3610.82 → 3620.58] are you committed to buy each of those 10 000 units okay takes up nine 40-foot containers nine tractors
[3620.58 → 3629.14] trailers so if we accelerate the delivery schedule, and they don't move like we're expecting and that's
[3629.14 → 3636.58] really expensive where are we going to put them where am I going to put 27 containers of backpacks
[3636.58 → 3644.82] imagine if you will the scale the size of 27 shipping containers
[3649.70 → 3655.06] like literally what would you do at that point could you do basically anything I don't know LU
[3660.10 → 3666.26] floor time is the only answer I have here if I want any more backpacks to
[3666.26 → 3672.90] arrive this year I have to decide before I've sold a single unit I believe in the product I think
[3672.90 → 3679.38] we're going to do it yeah but I just spent over another million dollars oh you did it decisions
[3679.38 → 3684.90] already made well it hasn't gone through Ivan, yet we might not have oh yeah we have so much we
[3684.90 → 3693.14] have literally all of our cash deployed in backpack and screwdriver right now so what we might have to do
[3693.14 → 3697.86] is we can play around with some mortgages that's an option Ivan really doesn't want to do it commercial
[3697.86 → 3702.82] mortgages are very time-consuming do you do it to apply for a commercial mortgage costs over ten thousand
[3702.82 → 3713.30] dollars to apply for it oh Geez right commercial landscape in bc is like horrifying yeah so we could
[3713.30 → 3718.90] play around with some mortgages, but that would be expensive and time-consuming we three officers rather
[3718.90 → 3723.14] store two containers work there how many containers was it 27 yeah 20 it's not two
[3726.98 → 3738.82] it's 27 okay sorry keep going people are saying let us pre-order no I won't, I won't, I insist that
[3739.86 → 3744.98] because what happens if I don't deliver it in August what if you pre-order it, and you're counting on it
[3744.98 → 3751.22] for school, and you end up having to go buy another bag well then i just you right and there's I don't
[3751.22 → 3755.30] want that global shipping right now is nuts I'm married I don't want you
[3760.50 → 3764.66] not that kind of relationship yeah it's just not understandable I mean maybe you'd be into it
[3764.66 → 3772.90] but i just can't how could I look my wife in the eye while we're spending time together if I knew
[3772.90 → 3773.78] that i just you
[3778.18 → 3780.50] that refectory time though um
[3784.02 → 3791.94] gotta hydrate get them election lights oh my goodness yeah I don't know i um
[3791.94 → 3802.42] I respect it so no i i i yeah I just won't do it I've made my choice I've made my choice so um
[3802.98 → 3808.90] yeah, so one of the other ideas is that with the first round I believe we paid for all the materials
[3808.90 → 3816.66] up front in order to lock in the cost that means that probably our our our fourth 10 000 units is going
[3816.66 → 3823.86] to cost more that's okay um worst case scenario we raise the pricing marginally we've never done it
[3823.86 → 3828.66] before, but this is a really different product for us and if it happens it happens we will the ones that
[3828.66 → 3833.46] are locked in we are absolutely locked in on the pricing that we've got, but that's 30 000 units I think
[3833.46 → 3838.82] most of the land show faithful will be able to get one at that price um but what we could do is we
[3838.82 → 3846.26] could not lock in so we could just pay a normal deposit and then wait until we have made that much
[3846.26 → 3852.98] money hopefully on screwdrivers, and we'll, we'll take screwdriver money and dump it back into backpack
[3852.98 → 3857.06] and so you're talking august or backpack do you have a similar timeline for screwdriver
[3858.90 → 3868.26] oh no screwdriver we still have one more technical challenge to resolve around the ratchet there's a
[3868.26 → 3876.42] um there's a tolerance thing that we've got to figure out to make sure that it always stays locked
[3876.42 → 3882.90] in the correct position we believe we have it completely nailed down, but we need another set of
[3882.90 → 3888.50] samples from the factory to make sure that it actually worked in the real world and what else will
[3888.50 → 3893.70] hopefully be final sample for that one that should be final for that one cool so if all goes according to
[3893.70 → 3898.50] plan for screwdriver the good news with screwdrivers we have a lot more of the parts already produced
[3898.50 → 3903.46] like we have a ton of injection moulding done we've got parts that are ready to be assembled we just
[3903.46 → 3909.62] need to make sure the ratchet is absolutely perfect because the thing is that a lot of people more
[3909.62 → 3915.14] people have criticized the pricing of the screwdriver than the backpack and I understand because 70
[3915.94 → 3922.42] is a lot for a screwdriver that is premium screwdriver pricing which means that there's a lot of pressure on
[3922.42 → 3928.10] us to deliver something that absolutely stands up to that I've seen people not really understanding what
[3928.10 → 3934.02] we're making criticizing it saying oh well this if this is only for building pcs that light duty work
[3934.02 → 3941.06] i I couldn't possibly justify spending this much it's for anything i uh I went to go because I was like
[3941.06 → 3947.38] yeah it's not cheap but like I know of ration screwdrivers that are more expensive so I went to go google
[3947.38 → 3952.90] snap on ratchet and screwdriver and it autofilled orange oh really I'm assuming because we're here
[3954.74 → 3959.06] that's also their default colour though oh is it they do have other colours, but orange is the default
[3959.06 → 3967.14] okay that's probably it then that's funny um so yeah it's not cheap but I think uh I think I should
[3967.14 → 3974.26] have probably mentioned this in the video about it, but that was the goal that's the mark because that
[3974.26 → 3980.98] was my screwdriver for many years and I simply wouldn't accept anything that doesn't meet that
[3980.98 → 3986.90] standard yeah so yeah that's what we were aiming for we were never aiming to build a budget screwdriver
[3987.46 → 3993.62] so if you want a cheap screwdriver there are a lot of options out there, but this one is really great
[3993.62 → 4002.66] yeah love it I love it yeah I'm really excited about it speaking of uh money and money problems
[4002.66 → 4009.78] and all that kind of stuff we're hiring we're hiring more people yeah I know right uh to go along with
[4009.78 → 4015.94] labs there's going to be a website and that website is going to do cool stuff and look cool and I need
[4015.94 → 4021.62] someone who's going to make a lot of the stuff that is going to do cool stuff and I need someone who's
[4021.62 → 4026.66] going to make a lot of the stuff that's going to like look cool and also has function I need a front
[4026.66 → 4032.98] end and a back end developer uh JavaScript based for the website uh we're still kind of figuring out
[4032.98 → 4037.94] exactly how we want to do certain things but JavaScript experience is the main thing we're looking for
[4038.66 → 4045.38] uh I don't necessarily know the best way to get this out to you guys but I'm going to put it in the
[4045.38 → 4050.50] various chats and if we could put it under the video for people that are watching on YouTube and stuff
[4050.50 → 4055.78] that would be fantastic um there's two different google forms just sign up for the Google form and
[4055.78 → 4063.94] you're good both of these positions can be worked remote um, but there is a strong preference for
[4063.94 → 4072.50] Canadians that is the that is the main thing local would also be great uh but Canadian is the main
[4072.50 → 4079.06] goal flipped a mattress on twitch says 70 is the cost of an fixity pro tech toolkit absolutely very
[4079.06 → 4084.98] different tool very different tools and shadow guardian over on float plane gets it every cheap
[4084.98 → 4090.58] ratcheting screwdriver I've had has been absolute crap yeah exactly that's exactly it, and we're not
[4090.58 → 4097.94] setting out to build that okay well both the forms are closed I'm not logged in on this computer so uh
[4097.94 → 4103.86] uh Luke yeah I'll fix that later just look in the description under the video uh it will be fixed
[4103.86 → 4112.10] tonight so yeah look later uh this is a great question from dale d another merch message our intel
[4112.10 → 4118.26] t-series processors if I recall correctly those are the low power ones compatible with all motherboards
[4118.26 → 4123.62] or are they OEM only currently building a server slash NAS and I want something very low power okay I guess
[4123.62 → 4129.54] I got that right passive water cooling okay building my own case as well to fit 10 hard drives
[4129.54 → 4134.58] wow very fun sounding project generally speaking yes they should be compatible with any motherboard
[4134.58 → 4140.66] that's compatible with that family, but it's not a guarantee that that compatibility will be perfect i
[4140.66 → 4146.26] would check with the motherboard manufacturer to ensure that it will work exactly as you expect it to
[4146.26 → 4151.06] I have never seen it not work but I'm sure there are edge cases where it hasn't worked
[4151.06 → 4157.30] Brayden c question for Luke about flow plane as someone in computer science I was wondering what
[4157.30 → 4165.06] technologies and languages you use for it what don't we use a lot of stuff and like I don't know
[4165.06 → 4173.54] it's its it is mean stack and JavaScript based it's, but we do a lot of different things so oh my goodness
[4173.54 → 4181.94] um yeah I think that's the best way to describe that what just happened I just tried to curate one
[4181.94 → 4189.38] and I think it disappeared uh oh no never mind yeah it's instantly curated uh why don't we do one of our
[4189.38 → 4203.14] one of our topics intel introduces the new ATX 3.0 and ATX 12v0 2.0 specifications ATX 3.0 is a really
[4203.14 → 4213.22] interesting one it's got the 12 volt HPR or high power connector that intel says will power most
[4213.86 → 4221.78] if not all I can't imagine anything it wouldn't power future PCIE 5.0 desktop cards this thing is
[4221.78 → 4228.58] going to do 600 watts of power over a single cable and don't forget ladies and gentlemen that these cards
[4228.58 → 4238.98] can draw an additional 75 watts from the slot we're talking a total of 675 watts for a single card
[4240.58 → 4247.38] it includes side Baden signals that let the PSU tell the GPU its power limit so not all of them will
[4247.38 → 4254.74] be capable of delivering 600 watts I mean obviously a 650 watt power supply is not going to be able to send
[4254.74 → 4264.74] all of it over the PCIE power cable to a GPU uh so I believe they are I can't remember what the
[4264.74 → 4270.18] different steps are, but power supplies will have different tiers of how much power they can deliver
[4270.18 → 4276.58] over that connector, and they will communicate that to the GPU and there's a new power excursion limit for
[4276.58 → 4284.50] PCIE 5.0 cards to hopefully remedy power spikes including updated DC voltage regulation guidelines
[4284.50 → 4289.70] intel is expecting PCIE gen 5 devices to require even more power than the currently available ones
[4289.70 → 4297.70] which says a lot in a world where NVIDIA created the RTX 3090 ti has NVIDIA come out and disclosed a TDP
[4298.34 → 4306.82] for the 3090 ti I actually do not know oh apparently it's 450 watts according to tech power up here
[4306.82 → 4316.58] 450 watts ladies and gentlemen turned down for watts literally every watt with a suggested power supply
[4316.58 → 4330.90] capacity of 850 watts and then what is this holy crap a MSI card has supposedly leaked that has what it's oh it's
[4330.90 → 4342.18] higher TDP of 480 watts wow that's fantastic that's crazy do they have more pictures of it holy bananas look
[4342.18 → 4351.70] how thick this thing is it's a thick boy it's three and a half slots what am I even looking at
[4351.70 → 4360.98] it's crazy wow all right do you still need a minute because I can keep stalling uh no you can go all
[4360.98 → 4373.70] right cool um also we got 12 ATX 12 VO 2.0 so ATX 12 VO was all about better power efficiency at idle and
[4373.70 → 4379.14] we actually got our hands on a compatible power supply and motherboard must have been about must have been
[4379.14 → 4383.94] over a year ago about a year ago I don't remember the point is we got our hands on it and it really
[4383.94 → 4391.22] worked huge difference so I'm kind of excited about this just from like an environmental standpoint
[4392.42 → 4400.90] um and let's have a look at what it does okay so it's got the I underscore PSU percent feature
[4401.70 → 4407.86] uncertain what that is, but it was previously available in mobile and server systems Anthony says presumably
[4407.86 → 4412.82] this refers to communicating total PSU utilization so that resources can be allocated to the devices
[4412.82 → 4418.66] that need it most, but that's just a theory a game theory good reference love its intel also claims the
[4418.66 → 4424.42] new spec will help small form factor pcs meet energy regulations specifically calling out California's
[4424.42 → 4431.70] tier 2 appliance rules, so this could mean that uh oh this probably refers to California's 60 kilowatt
[4431.70 → 4437.70] hour per year figure for desktops with an expandability score between 250 and 425. Intel claims
[4437.70 → 4443.94] this is the most substantial change to the ATX spec since ATX 2.0 in 2003 and for reference
[4443.94 → 4450.42] that included emphasizing a shift from 3.3 and 5 volt to 12 volts independent overcurrent protection
[4450.42 → 4457.38] for each 12 volt rail the 24 pin ATX connector up from 20 pin that replaced the six pin auxiliary
[4457.38 → 4464.26] connector SATA power connectors being mandatory alternative sleep mode aka modern standby v2.51
[4464.26 → 4469.94] one and ripple efficiency minimum load guidelines and requirements in point updates here's our
[4469.94 → 4476.02] discussion question posed by Anthony young do we really need 600 watts of capacity running over a
[4476.02 → 4484.34] single connector to a single card I say yes yeah we're not on the one hand I'm very pro efficiency but
[4484.34 → 4491.54] on the other hand man when I press that gas pedal I want it to just belch black smoke baby you can be
[4491.54 → 4497.46] pro efficient you can be pro efficiency and also obviously I'm playing a bit of a character right
[4497.46 → 4504.02] now the uh availability of the option of power when needed yeah for sure I mean for applications where
[4504.02 → 4511.30] the performance matters by all means and especially seeing the way that um graphics card manufacturers are
[4511.30 → 4516.74] building tools that allow you to limit the power consumption and limit also high draw doesn't mean
[4516.74 → 4523.46] low efficiency yeah yeah that's another thing it could be it could be spitting out so many frames
[4523.46 → 4530.66] yeah 600 watts is a lot I mean the cooling challenges the cooling challenges' oh yeah well the card was huge
[4530.66 → 4540.02] yeah like water cooling is almost like a necessity by that point I feel like I would default to that
[4540.02 → 4544.58] yeah oh absolutely I mean you're not going to be putting many other cards in a computer that's got
[4544.58 → 4550.98] one and like not with a really tiny rad either nope like it's going to have to be a pretty serious setup
[4550.98 → 4557.06] we've already reached the point where triple rad setups on intel k-series skews can outperform
[4557.06 → 4562.74] dual rad setups' oh yeah yeah in a way that is meaningful in a way that matters I thought you meant whole system
[4562.74 → 4568.34] I was actually asked in float plane chat for thoughts on the 12 900 KS being 800
[4569.22 → 4575.22] frankly for the performance it doesn't surprise me that much but I am looking forward to intel having
[4575.22 → 4580.82] a more efficient gaming chip, and hopefully we're going to see that with raptor lake down the road
[4581.86 → 4586.74] or is rocket lake coming first I can't remember which one's first rocket I mean maybe rocket is first
[4586.74 → 4593.46] and then raptor lake I can never keep all the lakes code words code names also just as an update on the
[4593.46 → 4600.58] forms I tried to like open the applications on my phone yeah it I have no control over the phone or
[4600.58 → 4606.74] over the form through my phone so I'm going to have to do it when I get home twitch plays Dean says 800 CPU
[4606.74 → 4613.14] WTF Brad but remember extreme edition doesn't even exist anymore those used to start at like a thousand
[4613.14 → 4618.90] dollars for that whole lineup intel doesn't even have that anymore so if this is an extreme edition
[4618.90 → 4628.10] and it's a 16 core CPU that's real fast for like everything than uh yeah it's a lot of money and most
[4628.10 → 4633.70] people won't buy it, but most people never were buying CPUs in that price range, and you could almost
[4633.70 → 4640.66] think of it as discounted compared to what we used to pay for a 16 core CPU almost because I remember the
[4640.66 → 4647.78] days when even the top end extreme edition was a grand and not like two grand or whatever
[4647.78 → 4652.42] shark jumping they had done by the end of it they did some pretty rapid hops near the end man I'll be
[4652.42 → 4658.74] real interested to see what pricing is like for 3090 ti will it reflect pandemic shortage pricing or will
[4658.74 → 4664.98] it reflects the more recent price drops that we've actually witnessed in the GPU market like let's head
[4664.98 → 4670.82] over to actually you know what I've read about it but I have not personally verified any of this yet
[4670.82 → 4679.14] use market I saw that 3070 tis were going for not outlandish amounts of money in the secondary market
[4679.86 → 4689.30] 3070 ti all right and then lets this is always my way this is my way show only sold items
[4689.30 → 4701.86] but about but hmm okay 750 open box 880 780 830 so it looks like they're really in the high 700s low 900s range
[4702.66 → 4711.94] here's one from today for 660 though like that seems to be coming down to earth a little bit here's an VGA
[4711.94 → 4722.74] ftw3 for 635 I mean that wouldn't have happened not that long ago launch price of a 3070 ti was 599 right
[4724.66 → 4726.42] so they can be had
[4728.42 → 4735.70] for approaching MSRP, but a lot of people are still paying far too much for them is what it looks like
[4735.70 → 4743.62] right now, but it's not double MSRP like it was yeah so I'm not saying it's good I'm saying it's improved
[4747.38 → 4748.02] oh boy
[4749.38 → 4749.70] yeah
[4750.34 → 4756.18] hey my take is not that the 12 900ks is a bargain my take is that you weren't going to buy it anyway
[4756.18 → 4763.06] it was an uh it was a segment of the market that was never serving that you were never part of
[4763.06 → 4769.14] and that's okay I've never bought an extreme edition oh except until retail edge you've never
[4769.14 → 4776.02] bought an extreme edition except until retail edge which were deeply discounted CPUs for retail
[4776.02 → 4782.66] um like sales people so don't take it personally when I say you're not the target market I'm not the
[4782.66 → 4790.26] target market either because I think you'd have to be crazy to buy the KS when the k exists in fact if i
[4790.26 → 4795.30] was just building a rig for someone whose money I cared about I wouldn't go above the i7
[4797.78 → 4808.90] I don't think I ever have like the yeah no uh the 12 600k is like still a 12 core it's got all eight
[4808.90 → 4814.82] performance cores it's overclockable if you really want that extra little bit of gaming performance like
[4814.82 → 4821.94] there you go that's it actually there's some perfect value like even like core i's have
[4821.94 → 4828.18] you ever had people like pretty good got you to build a computer ask for higher than an i7 equivalent
[4828.18 → 4833.78] oh yeah I mean back when I was working at NCI of course I tried to talk every extreme edition buyer
[4833.78 → 4841.14] out of it you know what's crazy I had someone message me with uh with a customer service request
[4841.14 → 4848.90] that they sent in to the pc advisor at NCI which was an email inbox that I manned alone back in those
[4848.90 → 4854.26] days, and they were like hey just wanted to show you this as a blast from the past a little bit of
[4854.26 → 4860.50] nostalgia, and it had their question and my answer and I can't figure out where they sent it to me anymore
[4861.46 → 4867.46] I'm so frustrated because I thought it was so cool that they went out of their way to send that to me
[4867.46 → 4875.14] and i I can't figure it out it's not I can't find it in my inbox on the forum I can't find it in my
[4875.14 → 4880.74] email I have no idea where they sent it to me now that you're saying this will probably just send it
[4880.74 → 4885.70] again yeah maybe they will but solve that problem yeah it sucks because I thought it was
[4885.70 → 4891.70] hilarious remember it no, no not at all I mean it was just you know generic which GPU should I pick
[4891.70 → 4897.30] and how many hard drives like that kind of stuff yeah, but it was definitely written by me when I had
[4897.30 → 4902.66] time because I was very thorough and I was like oh wow I did a really great job
[4905.22 → 4912.02] uh yeah I'm i yeah it sucks i I would have loved I would have loved to show it to you guys because i
[4912.02 → 4920.82] just thought it was hilarious what's our next topic here Ukraine is selling invasion timeline Mets
[4920.82 → 4926.74] that's right NFTs might actually be being used for something productive the Ukrainian government is
[4926.74 → 4935.38] raising funds by selling NFTs based on the timeline of the Russian invasion the minister of digital
[4935.38 → 4940.34] transformation announced the collections launch on Twitter so we're going to go ahead and whoa that's
[4940.34 → 4945.46] not what I meant to do we're going to go ahead and fire that up here stop
[4945.46 → 4951.38] Washington you can check it out here, so there's a gallery
[4954.66 → 4956.50] and these are the NFTs
[4960.74 → 4963.38] very trays interesting okay
[4965.62 → 4973.30] so like are they live now I don't know unreleased oh okay I guess they haven't actually
[4973.30 → 4983.06] been made available yet yeah oh tray's interesting all right are they all tweets
[4984.50 → 4993.54] I don't know the truth is because NFTs are such a toxic exploitative technology in their current
[4993.54 → 5001.38] implementation I have not taken the time to figure out how to buy one and stuff like that oh no yeah
[5001.38 → 5006.42] that's all whatever i just um yeah these are not they're not released I was wondering like what the
[5006.42 → 5012.42] theme was, and it looks like uh maybe not all of them or I'm not sure if some of these aren't
[5012.42 → 5019.46] actually complete um, but it looks like most of them are framed around a tweet got it um yeah the
[5019.46 → 5024.58] collection is titled meta history museum of war and proceeds will go to the ministry of digital
[5024.58 → 5030.10] transformation to support the army into civilians of Ukraine the civilians absolutely need some
[5030.10 → 5039.54] support over there and uh minus hot take NFTs for war are okay NFTs for self-defence are okay I abhor
[5039.54 → 5050.50] violence in any form but when an aggressor is trying to take your stuff and like kidnap your people
[5050.50 → 5056.34] you got to do something about it uh it was supposed to be an airdrop of free tokens to people who had
[5056.34 → 5061.38] donated crypto to Ukraine, but it changed due to copyright scams and complaints that not all donors
[5061.38 → 5067.62] would receive tokens ah man uh discussion question here thank you Nicholas Plough is this going to spark
[5067.62 → 5072.10] a bunch of NFT scammers to try and sell similar NFTs and then not donate the proceeds to Ukraine
[5072.66 → 5076.82] that's already happening immediately diving in to figure out is like is this account legit
[5076.82 → 5082.82] is this are we reporting on something that's bad etc, but it seems legit Anthony's take probably
[5084.26 → 5089.54] now I mean I told you like they're when they sent out information on like these are
[5089.54 → 5096.82] like bitcoin Ethereum whatever wallet links they're they're like keys a bunch of people when people
[5096.82 → 5104.26] were asking like hey does someone have the the the address we're sending the wrong one obviously their
[5104.26 → 5110.98] own to try to scrape money so like it's literally already happened in an extremely related way right
[5110.98 → 5120.90] and I'm sure it will happen this time oh that's frustrating yep in brighter news Riley is a character
[5120.90 → 5129.70] in avid ya game yeah that's right ladies and gentlemen it's called star tenders okay yeah it's out for quest
[5129.70 → 5139.38] two and PSV now like bartenders I get it yeah coming to steam soon he plays a character named Riley r dot
[5139.38 → 5146.26] I dot l dot e because they named it after him, it's a sci-fi bartending game with a full narrative
[5146.26 → 5152.82] campaign and everything developed by foggy box games under the forecast umbrella, and you can see slash hear
[5152.82 → 5161.22] his character at 42 seconds and seven minutes and 28 seconds here so uh hold on a second oh how do i
[5161.22 → 5166.18] hear this I guess I can't, I don't think you can well I think the stream can though is this Riley's
[5166.18 → 5174.10] character that's awesome what was that other time stamp uh he said 42 seconds and seven minutes and 28
[5174.10 → 5184.90] seconds okay here we go clearly wall e based that's amazing there he is look it's Riley Murdoch
[5186.02 → 5192.10] I don't know if you guys know this but Riley has done a fair amount of voice acting uh it's something
[5192.10 → 5199.06] that we are we're happy we're happy to support him doing here um it does cause him to miss tech link days
[5199.06 → 5205.54] sometimes but I think it's super cool, and we always try to find a way to accommodate that Riley's
[5205.54 → 5210.50] just Riley's just such a character voice acting so interesting to me but I absolutely do not think
[5210.50 → 5215.70] I have a good voice for it, I think Riley absolutely does oh he's he's great so like second I loaded up
[5215.70 → 5220.50] the trailer and I heard his voice I was like yep it's perfect yep this is great I love it
[5222.90 → 5228.02] I think that's it for that though let's show it out PSV exclusive which is kind of what it says
[5228.02 → 5233.94] it's out for quest 2. oh coming to steam soon oh it's just the video that was linked is specifically
[5233.94 → 5241.70] a PSV one got it got it all right yes I do demo one uh do we want to shout out how
[5241.70 → 5249.14] to build a pc last guide you'll ever need oh we do is it out it is not out it'll be released next
[5249.14 → 5254.74] weekend if all goes according to plan, and it has taken months of effort between the writing team
[5254.74 → 5262.74] logistics shooters and editors with a total of five hosts right now the current cut is an hour and 45
[5262.74 → 5271.78] minutes long so it's an actual feature film length LTT video about a quarter of the video is part
[5271.78 → 5280.34] selection rationale, and we actually never select any parts because the intention is that it's going to be
[5280.34 → 5288.10] how to build a pc the last guide you'll ever need everything you could need to know to figure it out
[5288.10 → 5292.74] for yourself if that kind of makes sense does this mean you guys are never going to make another guide
[5293.62 → 5298.10] um I don't know if we would never make another guide, but we would never need to
[5298.74 → 5305.06] yeah no one would ever need to is the goal maybe there could be a need for a more concise guide
[5305.06 → 5312.26] it's a little long yeah it's a little bit on the long side, but it focuses, or it doesn't it goes over
[5312.26 → 5318.10] all the pc building concepts that you need to understand rather than just focusing on one build
[5318.10 → 5324.18] and describes how to build pcs around both PGA and LGA CPUs talks about even the big boy sockets like
[5324.18 → 5332.82] thread ripper epic LGA 3647 it's basically exactly what it sounds like and let me tell you it was a
[5332.82 → 5339.38] marathon script review session i I think it was over three hours of me I mean that makes sense
[5339.38 → 5347.22] because the script is so long yeah, yeah so Anthony wrote it I script reviewed it we have five hosts
[5347.22 → 5352.02] logistics has been heavily involved in helping me shoot b-roll I believe there are 900 b-roll shots
[5352.02 → 5360.58] or something stupid like that like I think the video was shot in November, and we are now finally
[5360.58 → 5366.82] releasing if it's going to be quite the thing it's going to be quite the thing uh we should do some
[5366.82 → 5373.14] more merch messages yeah Michael c says my PSP battery swelled and storage I replaced it but what
[5373.14 → 5377.54] can we do about long-term storage of systems with internal batteries like the PS vita and switch
[5377.54 → 5383.70] eventually nothing other than put them at I think it's about 40 is optimal for lithium double check that
[5383.70 → 5387.62] double check that I don't remember the exact number, but you just have to put them at a certain level put
[5387.62 → 5392.10] them into storage make sure they're kept at a fairly constant temperature about room temperature I think
[5392.10 → 5397.22] is best or is it better to go colder can't remember look it up and that's it and if it's stored for too
[5397.22 → 5403.78] long it'll swell, and you'll have to replace it and that's why right to repair matters so much we should
[5403.78 → 5408.66] have the right to use something for as long as we wish to use it in any way we wish to use it and I don't
[5408.66 → 5419.06] understand how anyone can argue with that yeah yeah stop simping for billionaires it's that simple Jr
[5419.06 → 5424.42] got my tax return today will there be a way to swap the orange or black accents on the screwdriver
[5424.42 → 5435.70] with custom parts i.e I want a forest green accent okay so technically the top cap could be removed but
[5435.70 → 5445.06] it's difficult, and it would be very difficult to replace it on your own and the beauty ring around
[5445.06 → 5451.94] the ratchet selector would also be it's called a beauty ring we call it that because it serves
[5451.94 → 5457.38] no function other than aesthetics oh yeah to cover up the bare aluminum of the ratchet mechanism where
[5457.38 → 5461.94] it meets the handle oh I thought you meant like the selector no that's the selector ring yeah the beauty
[5461.94 → 5471.14] ring just sits in between it uh is it a surface that could be painted without it just like coming
[5471.14 → 5476.26] off on your hands all the time you'd never touch it, but it would chip probably because there's moving
[5476.26 → 5480.98] parts well he said I don't think he's just meaning the beauty ring I think it sounds like both
[5482.66 → 5489.70] yeah exactly yeah uh I'd say it won't be easy um we'd like to do other colours in the future I can't
[5489.70 → 5496.66] say that I think forest green would be a high priority but yeah uh I'd say it will be very
[5496.66 → 5502.74] challenging that's going to be my final word on that Patrick v picked up a mystery shirt for the
[5502.74 → 5508.02] girlfriend hey heck yeah Patrick you can click to view more by the way oh whoa a bunch of stuff
[5508.58 → 5517.06] 21 ounce water bottle scrunchie thin pack very nice aqua towel I have a question about submerged mineral oil
[5517.06 → 5521.54] the oh the submerged sorry they're coming in so fast right now because we're reading them
[5524.10 → 5530.82] uh a submerged mineral oil pc won't turn on how do you recommend testing the parts should I put it on
[5530.82 → 5536.90] different hardware oh this is a is a tough one putting it on different hardware is likely the
[5536.90 → 5542.58] only way to test it, but you will get mineral oil all over everything and as you learned it will eventually
[5542.58 → 5553.78] eat stuff so yeah it um it's a fun novelty project, but it's not necessarily something that I would
[5553.78 → 5560.10] recommend for daily driver use well I mean he has one already yeah but it's dead so it might be time to
[5560.10 → 5563.38] move you're recommending his next project I get it okay yeah yeah
[5565.94 → 5570.58] Chelsea my parents are moving to the other side of the US any advice on what I should do before they
[5570.58 → 5576.26] leave to make remote support easier one quick thing about the mineral oil stuff um
[5578.34 → 5582.34] if you're going to try to fix it do whatever you can to keep that oil off of parts that aren't going to
[5582.34 → 5589.30] go back into that machine because it can take an excessively long time to actually have them not be oily
[5589.30 → 5596.34] yeah it's basically impossible yeah Chelsea first shout out for you know being all cool and
[5596.34 → 5603.54] helping out your parents um other than putting remote support apps on their devices ahead of time that you
[5603.54 → 5612.66] share the credentials for man there are having a backup remote support app is pretty cool um I like
[5612.66 → 5618.58] writing things down like setting them up with a password manager or like my grandparents for example who
[5618.58 → 5624.98] would just cannot be trusted with anything technology I have like a master book that not
[5624.98 → 5630.50] only acts as a reference for them for important things like passwords and account names in that form
[5630.50 → 5636.90] yep uh it also acts as a reference for me when I visit so I can remember what I changed last time
[5636.90 → 5642.02] I've tried to force last pass onto a lot of it or other various password managers that parts are relevant
[5642.02 → 5648.26] on to quite a few different people and some people just don't work that way yep they need books as
[5648.26 → 5654.74] much as that is not recommended, and it should be safe it should be locked up but yeah some people just
[5654.74 → 5660.10] you know they just need that so other than that man I don't know what else to tell you having
[5660.10 → 5664.98] it having a backup uh remote access app like having two different paths in can be good because every
[5664.98 → 5675.70] once in a while things can go wrong well what else would you do yeah I mean remote support is the
[5675.70 → 5680.90] main thing it's tough i one thing I would recommend as well is try to get remote support that you can
[5680.90 → 5686.02] log into without their assistance yeah because you might have things like the monitor is not plugged in
[5686.90 → 5692.42] and it's difficult for you to diagnose that yeah make sure you've briefed them on how to conduct
[5692.42 → 5697.70] a video call whether it's via FaceTime or WhatsApp or whatever yeah because if it comes down to it
[5697.70 → 5701.70] and I've done this multiple times yeah they can do the face call, and they just point the phone at the
[5701.70 → 5707.70] computer fix things that way before it's its definitely operable um
[5710.26 → 5716.74] yeah I think that's about it, you could do a nine night executable of most of their programs and
[5716.74 → 5720.66] just get them to like to run it every once in a while because that'll update everything that's not bad
[5720.66 → 5727.06] so I'm glad orbital AFK looking forward to the backpack bit concerned about keeping my water bottle
[5727.06 → 5732.58] inside in case I need to use a nonet store LTT store bottle well why would you ever use a nonet
[5732.58 → 5736.90] store bottle is there anything I can do to protect my technology and school supplies okay so
[5737.86 → 5741.78] we actually did give some thought to this we're all about making sure our products work together but
[5741.78 → 5747.54] we're also all about making sure our products just work the water bottle sleeve if you guys can see
[5747.54 → 5754.74] it in their can you see it uh you can kind of see if it's uh got an elastic on it so at its widest
[5756.18 → 5762.26] yeah there we go at its widest it's the right size for our 40 ounce but actually here actually
[5762.26 → 5769.30] Luke can I have your 21 ounce it's also designed to accommodate without allowing them to fall over
[5769.30 → 5775.54] tightly a much skinnier water bottle, so there should be no reason for your water bottle to fall over
[5775.54 → 5785.22] in the bag yeah oh my goodness so many merch messages coming in Jeffrey what are your thoughts
[5785.22 → 5789.46] about apple putting the SSD controller on the motherboard instead of on the storage unit
[5790.82 → 5796.98] I mean i I think I made it really clear that it frustrates me to see companies engineering for
[5796.98 → 5807.14] um forced deprecation of their hardware it's not that the idea is inherently bad having the controller
[5807.14 → 5817.38] on the SOC very likely has great performance advantages to putting it on the SSD itself but apple
[5817.38 → 5823.46] absolutely could have designed a SSD controller that would accommodate being upgraded with more flash they
[5823.46 → 5830.34] just choose not to, and it's that kind of obstinance and arrogance that frustrates me so much about
[5830.34 → 5837.86] apple's way of doing business they could have done what they did in a super cool way they just decided
[5839.14 → 5847.22] you and that they wouldn't so there's my thoughts on that yeah uh Bryson says uh oh okay same thing i
[5847.22 → 5850.90] fix it didn't tear down attempted to replace the storage it appeared not to work any thoughts
[5850.90 → 5857.94] yeah I think I've said my piece on that I think you did this one too yep Jonah l says former video
[5857.94 → 5862.98] editor for a tech channel that toured my studio wow that really narrows it down I don't know who
[5862.98 → 5868.98] you are though i I'm sorry uh what protections do you have in place for your staff would you support
[5868.98 → 5876.10] a unionization of stash slash camera crew under YouTube creators is YouTube creators a thing
[5880.90 → 5889.86] I think he means like I don't know interesting I'm not super up on is it a thing so I've I've made it
[5889.86 → 5897.22] very clear in the past oh is this the oh yeah I've heard of this I've made it very clear in the
[5897.22 → 5903.78] past that I feel that if our staff felt like they needed a union I would consider that and Yvonne too we
[5903.78 → 5910.02] would both consider it personal failures here in Canada there's absolutely nothing that we'd be able to do
[5910.02 → 5917.70] to prevent it legally speaking so if they decided that they wanted to approach their engagement with
[5917.70 → 5921.38] their employer that way that's there 's's absolutely nothing that we could do to challenge
[5921.38 → 5930.34] them on if it's actually sort of baffling to me that it is possible to have such blatant like just brazen
[5931.14 → 5938.10] anti organizing policies in place in our neighbours to the south i I don't get it
[5938.10 → 5946.26] um what protections do you have in place for your staff I mean really what does that mean yeah I don't
[5946.26 → 5954.02] really know I mean we have like a dental plan i I'm I'm not really a hundred percent sure what you're
[5954.02 → 5959.54] asking there are a lot of legal protections for employees just in general in Canada like it's
[5960.58 → 5966.26] my wife and I joke sometimes it's easier to get a divorce than to fire an employee like it's its actually
[5966.26 → 5973.22] very difficult so I don't really feel like they need additional protections to be perfectly honest
[5973.22 → 5979.78] with you um I know that in the states particularly in states where they have at-will employment it's a
[5979.78 → 5984.98] totally different story there's basically no protection whatsoever you can just dismiss someone
[5984.98 → 5991.46] for any reason at any time, and they're entitled to like nothing yes, but that is not the case up here at all
[5991.46 → 6001.38] um obvious lobster says probably like an anonymous report line for hr so we do have a third party hr firm
[6002.02 → 6009.30] um we do have if anyone ever had a problem with me, they could take it up with Yvonne, and we do take
[6009.30 → 6015.78] that anonymity, and we do take their privacy very seriously if they have an issue that is so big that
[6015.78 → 6022.66] they can't trust either of us with it frankly we've failed them anyway um i i I don't know what
[6022.66 → 6028.02] we could possibly do to resolve it uh I think that overall we try to do a perfect job of addressing
[6028.02 → 6037.30] people's concerns and I don't know what to tell you guys uh laddie says the thing is every bad boss in
[6037.30 → 6041.62] the world says you don't need a union I'm a good boss the reality is sometimes your interests will not
[6041.62 → 6045.86] align with your staff and relying on you being a good guy is them taking a risk being in a union
[6045.86 → 6050.66] doesn't change anything if you're a good enough boss the union never needs to be involved um that's
[6050.66 → 6057.30] one way of looking at it yeah but I mean I'm sorry I'm I'm not going to see eye to eye with you on that
[6058.66 → 6066.42] I agree that a lot of bad employers probably would say you don't need a union but in our case and have
[6066.42 → 6071.22] yeah we are and actively do yeah we're we're constantly trying to figure out how to make
[6071.22 → 6078.18] leg a better place to work that's not going to change so there you go and I think there's been
[6078.18 → 6084.90] constant improvements over the years um well I should hope so I mean in the early days it was no it was not
[6084.90 → 6092.18] great we're always trying we worked out of a garage we were a scrappy company I literally lived in his
[6092.18 → 6101.78] house it's okay dusty yeah you had both uh tenant rights and employee rights yeah dude i
[6101.78 → 6105.70] I had it good I'm pretty sure we violated all of them probably yeah
[6107.86 → 6116.10] but he did get meals included dude good ones too uh dusty old crow have you considered making
[6116.10 → 6122.42] a breakaway lanyard uh also what would you recommend as a solution for switching a console's
[6122.42 → 6128.18] output between a TV and a computer monitor across the room from the console okay so breakaway lanyard
[6128.18 → 6132.50] we've looked at it the problem is the breakaway mechanisms we found tend to be flimsy and we
[6132.50 → 6137.30] haven't found anything we're happy with we know that there are requirements for certain uh for certain
[6138.18 → 6144.50] work environments, but we're just not there yet as for a solution for switching a console's output
[6144.50 → 6149.94] uh you're talking about an av receiver and there are also HDMI switches uh some of which have
[6149.94 → 6156.98] remotes that could be used in order to do that honestly though with CEC control you might not even
[6156.98 → 6163.54] need it because it could be that when you fire up that device it'll just automatically re-route depending
[6163.54 → 6168.50] on whether you can get a HDMI switch with that I'm not too familiar with HDMI switches just because i
[6168.50 → 6178.74] do have an av receiver but that may be an option question for cafetière Gabriel and Bella Vance
[6178.74 → 6186.66] employees of lingenmeister media what is your guys favourite and most hated retro older than 2000 tech
[6188.26 → 6193.62] this question is too big so I'm truncating it a little bit that's the part we'll answer favourite and
[6193.62 → 6203.38] most hated pre-2000 I mean honestly if I put myself back in my pre-2000 shoes I loved my Super Nintendo
[6203.38 → 6210.66] and especially when it was connected to my little portable TV that was like this size and had a VCR
[6210.66 → 6220.18] in the bottom man all my content one box loved it okay that was my favourite i yeah I mean I'm gonna
[6220.18 → 6224.98] decide that I'm going to put myself in the age that I was at that time sure and then also say super
[6224.98 → 6230.58] Nintendo yeah all right at that time we had like computers and stuff but the Super Nintendo was
[6230.58 → 6236.58] very accessible and couch gaming was like totally a thing oh yeah and like gaming with the family
[6236.58 → 6242.66] game with the neighbours etc and Super Nintendo was just sweet for that Jake bell events hit me
[6242.66 → 6253.46] n64 yeah well man a bunch of Nintendo kids here as for my most hated avalanche 1080 oh crappy rechargeable
[6253.46 → 6261.78] batteries rechargeable batteries in the pre-2000s sucked they were terrible the re and n64 is a good
[6261.78 → 6266.18] answer the reason why I didn't say n64 because I loved it as well is by that time I had started getting
[6266.18 → 6272.82] much more into computers and I think the I think the SNES had more of an impact on me at that time
[6272.82 → 6275.78] I'm also older so maybe that's why
[6279.30 → 6288.50] uh Joshua Carroll says hey Linus why do CPU clock speeds decrease as the core count increases good
[6288.50 → 6296.10] question the reason for that is that there's only so much power that a CPU can draw through
[6296.10 → 6303.62] the socket and that can be dissipated to a cooler and so if you were to just increase the frequency
[6303.62 → 6309.62] linearly you're going to increase that power draw and if you have twice as many cores running at an
[6309.62 → 6314.50] increased frequency you're going to quickly outstrip the amount of power you can deliver and the amount
[6314.50 → 6320.18] of heat you can dissipate the reason that you're able to scale down clock speed just a little bit
[6320.18 → 6328.18] and add way more cores is that the efficiency curve as you increase the clock speed as you increase the
[6328.18 → 6336.66] voltage is not linear so as you increase your clock speed along the x-axis now let's go clock speed y
[6336.66 → 6342.02] axis so as you increase your clock speed a lot no let's go x-axis as you increase your clock speed along
[6342.02 → 6349.06] the x-axis your power consumption and therefore heat output goes like this right it goes like that
[6350.02 → 6360.90] so by stepping back just a little bit you can bring your power consumption way, way down and that's why
[6360.90 → 6368.26] those low core count skews are able to hit these crazy clock speeds and high core count skews tend to
[6368.90 → 6374.26] not and when high core count skews do it's because they're taking whatever power budget they have
[6374.26 → 6380.10] available juicing it into one core and then running all the other ones at a much lower speed
[6383.94 → 6389.14] all right Tyler p thanks for the amazing products and amazing float plane from Luke shout out Luke yeah
[6390.42 → 6393.14] how far out is the updated theatre for float plane
[6393.14 → 6396.10] uh
[6400.26 → 6404.10] I don't want to say the actual expected time but soon
[6405.22 → 6411.78] okay also would be cool to see Ltd judge the customer service of float plane and the Ltd store for that video
[6412.42 → 6418.02] oh for the video where we evaluate our sponsors' oh that would be an interesting one right now I know our customer
[6418.02 → 6424.02] service for Ltd store is a little behind but we're working on that Zachary w would you guys consider
[6424.02 → 6429.78] making another reading mean comments yeah we would and have you gotten your revenge on Colton for his
[6429.78 → 6435.30] and Yvonne's pregnancy break on you not yet but I will, I haven't forgotten
[6437.14 → 6441.62] Kieran says hey guys big fans what suggestions do you have for your first step into making your home a
[6441.62 → 6448.18] smart home I mean I think yeah light switches are just such an obvious one uh the biggest one for
[6448.18 → 6454.58] me though in terms of importance is definitely cooling not wasting energy and having the rooms
[6454.58 → 6460.74] that I'm occupying being more comfortable big fan my uh my place is so small that it's honestly just
[6460.74 → 6468.66] not a big deal it's like probably just as much time to just like to get up and press the switch as it is to
[6468.66 → 6472.34] go with my phone and do it so it's like don't forget about voice control but I don't have any
[6472.34 → 6478.26] google homes or nests in my or excuse me uh google homes uh echoes I am not down with voice control
[6478.26 → 6486.42] unless it's local fair enough risks says very excited about the backpack I know Linus said it should fit the
[6486.42 → 6490.42] steam deck but I was curious if that was in the case it comes with or without the case so it's both
[6492.66 → 6496.26] uh this is actually another revision on this one that I forgot to mention to you guys
[6496.82 → 6504.18] the can you hold the bottom of it please thank you the bottom of this pouch now has a soft like
[6504.18 → 6511.38] microfiber like suede material at the bottom so if you were to slide a steam deck in bareback than it
[6511.38 → 6516.58] would sit with the screen against this which I think is pretty cool and then if you wanted to put it in
[6516.58 → 6519.62] with the case you could just shove it in the bag of holding
[6519.62 → 6528.18] Jeremy b says I noticed the intro has been missing from some recent videos I'm guessing
[6528.18 → 6536.58] this is intentional it is do you have a rationale yeah it's that the first minute of a video is where
[6536.58 → 6544.18] you're most likely to have people watching and if we're giving up eight precious seconds of people's
[6544.18 → 6553.30] attention for a canned animation um is this because of my notes which notes I guess not all right oh
[6553.30 → 6559.62] I sent notes months ago talking about how there's a dip during the intro oh we know that it's from
[6559.62 → 6567.70] skipping yeah yeah but like that's not good for no reasons yeah yeah no, no yes, yes uh so it's been
[6567.70 → 6574.74] a while coming, but we are my intention is to phase out the intro yes it like kind of sucks because it's
[6574.74 → 6581.14] been a staple for so long but like you have to that that's a point in time in the video right now that
[6581.14 → 6586.18] is extremely important as far as YouTube is concerned for retention and not skipping forward
[6586.18 → 6591.70] and all this other type of stuff so you have to play for those seconds has to happen john b first time
[6591.70 → 6596.10] watching live saw your review of the CD OLED alienware monitor wanted to know your thoughts on text
[6596.10 → 6602.98] clarity issues and colour fringing issues that users on ultra-wide Reddit have reported now I focused on
[6602.98 → 6611.30] it as a gaming monitor I did not actually spend a ton of time on it looking at text so I've talked to
[6611.30 → 6619.86] proof about that already, and we are hoping to take another look at it together I will say that I don't
[6619.86 → 6628.66] think Samsung's adversarial approach to people's concerns so far is very constructive but I also do
[6628.66 → 6637.70] think that there can be limitations to certain technologies that are worth the payoff it's a really
[6637.70 → 6644.98] cool display tech i I would think of it kind of like aperture grill CRTs for a super dated reference
[6644.98 → 6654.82] basically you could see these two lines that were caused by wires that were running kind of a quarter
[6654.82 → 6660.18] of the way down and a quarter way a quarter of the way up the screen, and you could easily make them out
[6660.18 → 6665.38] if you knew what you were looking for even though an average user probably wouldn't notice it but they
[6665.38 → 6672.66] gave you so much better image geometry that in my personal opinion they were worth the trade-off and in
[6672.66 → 6681.30] the case of CD OLED man they look so good that I'd have a hard time imagining it not being worth it
[6681.30 → 6687.30] but I will have to take a closer look at it Eric r hey Linus now that you have solar on your house
[6687.30 → 6691.94] what advice would you give to your tech-savvy listeners on what to say or where to direct people
[6691.94 → 6698.18] who ask about solar since we are the tech-savvy people where do you start it's tough because it's
[6698.18 → 6703.46] one of those industries where there's just not a lot of consumer facing information, and it's moving
[6703.46 → 6710.18] pretty quick and installers tend to have kickbacks from particular panel producers that they are not
[6710.18 → 6715.30] always going to be forthright about so you can't necessarily count on installers to give you great
[6715.30 → 6722.18] information I shouted out a distributor here in Canada who kind of carried everything for giving me the
[6722.18 → 6728.26] goods on you know what they were seeing installers preferring and what they were seeing low RMA rates
[6728.26 → 6736.34] on and stuff like that but other than that I don't even know I don't even know what to tell you I'm sorry
[6736.34 → 6742.58] yeah I mean I ended up with those dual sun ones just because I was super into them being a hybrid panel
[6742.58 → 6747.70] for both water heating and solar power generation I don't even know if they're any good
[6747.70 → 6757.06] yeah yeah it's tough Joshua h what's your opinion as a parent when it comes to what technology and
[6757.06 → 6762.26] devices your kids are allowed to use what kind of parental controls do you use I do use parental
[6762.26 → 6769.38] controls extensively family link on android as well as passwords on our computers in terms of what they're
[6769.38 → 6777.54] allowed to use my son has unlimited access to his kindle um our daughter our oldest daughter has been
[6777.54 → 6782.74] offered a phone now because she has demonstrated her trustworthiness that's one of our requirements
[6782.74 → 6789.70] is that our kids have to go for an extensive period of time without lying to mom and dad and lying
[6789.70 → 6797.06] includes withholding information uh when they know that it's pertinent, and she has passed that test now
[6797.06 → 6802.58] and we offered her one, but she said she doesn't want one just yet, but we limit phone use to I believe
[6802.58 → 6807.22] it's 45 minutes a day of anything other than the Kindle app, and they have to tell us what they're
[6807.22 → 6811.38] watching on YouTube they're allowed to watch educational YouTube without asking, but they need
[6811.38 → 6817.38] to ask us if they want to watch like minecraft lets plays or whatever so that's kind of where
[6817.38 → 6824.10] I'm at on that never really thought about the idea of the Kindle, but it makes sense yeah you can read
[6824.10 → 6831.30] whatever yeah exactly yeah uh Austin says absolutely loving the house content hey heck yeah Cameron so if
[6831.30 → 6835.22] we aren't going to get Linus Linux tips could we at least get some more in-depth videos on some of the
[6835.22 → 6840.58] software you guys set up during the house videos and server room videos ah man see I think that's a
[6840.58 → 6847.22] separate channel like it kind of has to be even then is that enough I don't know if it's enough content
[6847.22 → 6855.06] for another channel I just don't think we can justify it yeah and yes I'm an extremely strict parent mighty
[6855.06 → 6865.54] mouse but I have no regrets my kids are amazing they're wonderful so I wouldn't do I wouldn't do a
[6865.54 → 6872.82] single thing differently also the internet's a kind of crazy thing yeah you have to you absolutely
[6874.02 → 6878.26] have to be able to trust that your kids are going to tell you the truth if you're going to let them out
[6878.26 → 6885.22] there it's its effect on adults is like intense and overpowering for a lot of people the doom
[6885.22 → 6891.54] scrolling for days thing is like actually a real thing absolutely like it's its my kids are going
[6891.54 → 6898.42] outside ladies and gentlemen that's like that's the way it is no you find something else to do uh also my
[6898.42 → 6905.38] son we've started trading uh piano practice time for gaming time yeah that's pretty cool and uh yeah
[6905.38 → 6909.70] yeah man that's getting that's an interesting like yeah he is actually he's getting perfect
[6909.70 → 6917.30] at both yeah I haven't seen the piano I'm just I'm commenting on the gaming um, but that's
[6917.30 → 6923.06] cool because that's like kind of gamified yeah I like that yeah I'm into it, I feel like as a kid that
[6923.06 → 6929.14] feels less restrictive even though it's a restriction if that makes sense yeah nova nightmare asks if you had
[6929.14 → 6934.34] to pick one price not being a factor would you pick the new and i and neo next or the steam deck
[6935.38 → 6943.06] uh well the steam deck's got the touchpads so if you want to play games that require a touchpad
[6943.62 → 6949.38] like you want to play RTS games on mobile there's no choice I'm going to throw in some potential steam
[6950.02 → 6958.42] can you get an i and neo next I believe it's an Indiegogo right now oh is it Indiegogo yeah it's an
[6958.42 → 6964.74] Indiegogo I don't know when they're planning to deliver I mean counterpoint can you get a steam deck
[6964.74 → 6974.34] right now that was my point oh oh oh oh okay, okay uh no, no neither of them is shipping today so
[6974.34 → 6980.34] your answer might end up being whatever one you can if it's something you want that bad um because
[6980.34 → 6986.66] like I still don't have my email and I think I ordered pretty early yeah um I still don't did I
[6986.66 → 6993.54] say email I don't know if I said order email but yeah yeah I like I am super not that jazzed on the
[6993.54 → 6999.62] limited compatibility of the steam deck I have not been able to participate in some gaming experiences
[6999.62 → 7004.10] that I would have liked to in the last month and like okay yeah maybe we don't play the most normal
[7004.10 → 7010.98] games a lot of the time but like who does literally almost nothing that we play works on the steam deck
[7010.98 → 7017.86] because we mostly play halo ANO and uh supreme commander it's like darn it supreme commander does
[7017.86 → 7022.74] work I actually had a community member from FAF volunteer to help me set it up on the steam deck
[7022.74 → 7030.82] and I was just like I'll just play FAF later yeah no that's cool though that's cool that community's
[7030.82 → 7038.18] awesome what am I supposed to be talking about right now hey Linus uh oh yeah i oh man the game
[7038.18 → 7047.14] compatibility performance is more similar than you'd think what I really want is an IA neo next
[7048.10 → 7052.90] I want something with proper rdna2 graphics and zen 3 yeah
[7055.62 → 7059.94] but I can't wait yeah which one am I going to use when I'm done my steam deck challenge
[7062.34 → 7068.34] might be the idea, but it costs like twice as much so it's tough more than twice as much but the steam
[7068.34 → 7073.54] deck is so cool and the screen goes dimmer that's a big one because I play at night a lot I think if I was
[7073.54 → 7078.26] an average consumer and I was buying one it would probably be steam deck just purely because of
[7078.26 → 7084.50] price because the i neo pushes into a price range that's pretty decent gaming laptop yeah
[7085.22 → 7091.86] but that's obviously not comparable it's handheld I like the smaller profile of the i neo next it
[7091.86 → 7096.58] depends on your use case I can absolutely see people doing it I think it's just it's very specific
[7096.58 → 7109.46] I'm at 15 minutes order time I'm hoping for an email around April 1st true scot tasks did you see
[7109.46 → 7115.06] the Joe Rogan video about the metaverse and the next generation living their life completely in there
[7115.06 → 7120.82] therefore allowing china to take over the world in 30 years because of the strict internet usage rules for
[7120.82 → 7128.66] kids by the government what's your opinion on that i think i think you should not take
[7128.66 → 7135.14] everything that was just typed at exact value and I think we should just move on
[7138.82 → 7140.98] it sounds like a conversation you need to be there for
[7140.98 → 7150.26] uh should we take a should we take a break from merch message questions, and you should you show
[7150.26 → 7154.98] me the thing
[7154.98 → 7173.70] i tried i tried okay i I gave it a shot I tried to keep us on the rails it didn't work
[7173.70 → 7183.46] you just caused him physical pain text this is the power of the internet this is what I was talking
[7183.46 → 7184.82] about I'm recovering okay
[7189.14 → 7193.62] oh my god okay are you okay my abs
[7196.50 → 7203.62] oh man okay I'm fine I'm fine I'll be talking about now I'm not going to respond
[7203.70 → 7210.10] to that uh either the remaining merch messages or the thing yeah right the thing i
[7210.10 → 7217.06] was going to show you yeah um so I got a new wallet yeah okay check it out what do you think wow i
[7217.06 → 7224.82] didn't think it was wow it feels pretty nice it's leather real leather not show that I guess well no
[7224.82 → 7232.58] it's behind your laptop you're good you're good yeah ah nice yeah, yeah handmade if I didn't know who made
[7232.58 → 7238.82] it I would not assume that it was necessary there's like only one part that feels a little hand made
[7238.82 → 7246.18] and it's that one card slot yeah uh my wife made me a wallet which I think is super cool so it's got
[7246.18 → 7251.86] like a spot for cards and money it's got another more different spot for my ID with a little window in
[7251.86 → 7258.58] it and I'm I'm super jazzed which is great because my old wallet was falling apart so i i i it's i
[7258.58 → 7267.06] it got to the point where I've never cared about you know appearances like that you know like i i i
[7267.06 → 7276.18] wouldn't make sure that people see my Louis Vuitton a wallet while I pull up my credit card
[7276.18 → 7282.82] you know like i i never really cared about that kind of personal image kind of stuff um i I don't
[7282.82 → 7291.14] I don't get satisfaction from people knowing that I paid a lot for this thing, but it was at the point
[7291.14 → 7296.82] where it was like kind of embarrassing because it like had just shreds of letter leather hanging off
[7296.82 → 7300.50] of it like I'd gotten to the point where i kind of tried to like to take my card out sort of under the
[7300.50 → 7303.14] counter and yeah yeah put it back on
[7303.14 → 7314.74] but I'm uh why is he French Louis Vuitton okay don't you think this is a French name sorry
[7316.98 → 7321.70] I'm sure there's enough french blood in me for me to do that accent uh Adam b says what is the future
[7321.70 → 7326.66] for float plane trying to become more like YouTube no if not what are you going for well one of our one
[7326.66 → 7332.26] of our employees is trying to get his uh certification to be able to fly a float plane
[7332.98 → 7340.34] uh yeah okay that's super cool so uh I think he's watching too so that's that's the current you
[7340.34 → 7347.70] know developmental path we're going to move into actual flow planes um no i uh we're we're trying
[7347.70 → 7354.02] to make the platform better, and we're making more stuff should I talk about the thing have I talked about
[7354.02 → 7358.50] the things before I think I have yeah just talk about everything so we're working on uh something
[7358.50 → 7364.98] that the internal name is flow plane as a service fast I want to go fast we'll probably come
[7364.98 → 7371.62] up with a cooler name than that because as a service is uh yeah a little not trendy right now
[7371.62 → 7377.22] but the idea is we've had a lot of people reach out to us and be like hey like I would like to do the
[7377.22 → 7382.10] same thing as you sort of like I would like to have my own platform I don't necessarily want to join
[7382.10 → 7387.30] yours I don't necessarily want to join any I would just like to have my own yeah um so we've thought
[7387.30 → 7393.70] like okay that's pretty fair because that's why we made our own too um so we're trying to take the
[7393.70 → 7400.66] tools and the the the I guess just the powerful tools that we have made for flow plane um they're
[7400.66 → 7406.34] like super baller actually especially compared to what we know a lot of other people are using yeah
[7406.34 → 7410.74] so we're trying to make it so that other people can have their own sites so they don't have to be on
[7410.74 → 7415.62] float plane, and then we would just offer both creators could just join float plane, or they can
[7415.62 → 7419.94] make their own thing that you guys can join, and it's its their own stuff, but we manage the back
[7419.94 → 7426.10] end we we we make sure it all runs nice and good and if creators want to head over to float plane
[7426.10 → 7431.38] because Vimeo screwed them over or whatever we're super down you know come on over but the
[7431.38 → 7436.18] thing that people have to understand is that float plane's service is priced like it costs to deliver
[7436.18 → 7441.70] video because if you don't price it like it costs to deliver video then people get a big surprise when
[7441.70 → 7446.34] all of a sudden they're you know a couple of hundred dollar bill turns into thousands of dollars
[7446.34 → 7451.30] like what happened with some Vimeo users because serving video online is super freaking expensive
[7452.02 → 7456.18] it's just that simple yeah someone asked any comments about the Vimeo drama I've been tweeting about
[7456.18 → 7465.54] this too and my answer every time is just yeah it's expensive yeah if is is watching a stream or a
[7465.54 → 7472.50] video is not expensive then you're either paying for it in some other way or you are the product it's
[7472.50 → 7478.26] it's one of those things because it is just not a cheap thing to do um, and it's been delivered cheaply
[7478.26 → 7483.46] to a lot of people for a long time by a very small amount of extremely large companies yeah um that
[7483.46 → 7488.74] are making money in other ways and that's it like by selling your data which we don't do yeah Travis CI
[7488.74 → 7493.06] says Linus do you see LTT creating any new YouTube channels I should certainly hope so if we don't
[7493.06 → 7499.62] manage to create any more channels ever than we suck uh part p says hey great to catch the show live
[7499.62 → 7504.82] by the way my family owns a grocery store, and we're looking around to upgrade our cameras any recommendations
[7504.82 → 7510.34] for a small businessman um oh that's tough you know if I was a small business I'd probably just go wise
[7510.34 → 7517.70] cameras they're so cheap, and they like work you know if I was baller I'd go ubiquity because man is
[7517.70 → 7524.34] their stuff ever nice their camera stuff but wise cams they get it's that 80 20 right like they get
[7524.34 → 7530.98] you a lot of the way there hey Linus and Luke what software are you going to use for record playback of
[7530.98 → 7536.74] your home security cameras the software that came with my POE cameras is crap ubiquity oh so good so it
[7536.74 → 7543.86] has problems, but it's mostly so good thanks auto g for the merch message last one Paul h says hey
[7543.86 → 7548.02] given that the labs lead is starting in the next month is his there a ballpark eta for the first
[7548.02 → 7552.58] video to come out of leg labs that you feel comfortable revealing no not yet I don't want
[7552.58 → 7557.30] to promise anything and I've told the folks that are working on it is so far like your guy's job for the
[7557.30 → 7564.42] next six months is to think yeah and build processes and spend money yeah don't waste money but spend
[7564.42 → 7574.74] it that's pretty much the mission that I've set for them yeah all right I think that's pretty much
[7574.74 → 7580.18] it for the wan show little shout out reminder that I will fix those forms uh let's try to get them in
