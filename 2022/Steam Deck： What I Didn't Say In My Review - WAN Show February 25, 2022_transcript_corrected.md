[0.00 → 7.38] what is up ladies and gentlemen welcome to the wan show we've got a fantastic show lined up for
[7.38 → 15.50] you today yes obviously the big launch this week was the valve steam deck I've got one here uh now
[15.50 → 21.62] we can talk about everything that was in our video everything that wasn't in our video Luke can
[21.62 → 26.20] actually share some of his thoughts since we're not afraid of breaking embargo so you've got a
[26.20 → 30.16] short hands-on with him, but that was it he otherwise hasn't touched it so i was going to say
[30.16 → 34.94] I've used it for like five seconds yeah we can get Luke's fresh impressions of the steam deck yeah
[34.94 → 42.76] in other news this week uh tons of stuff the's going crazy yeah the tip shortage
[42.76 → 50.76] could get a lot worse turns out um 90 of the neon used in U.S. semiconductors comes from drum roll
[50.76 → 59.70] Ukraine uh that's not good for a variety of reasons on in completely unrelated news Sony's
[59.70 → 66.78] PlayStation VR 2 uh is we got some like little sneak peeks going on there uh and also uh
[66.78 → 74.92] man there are a lot of topics that i don't know if i want to go into uh you can't uh get copyright
[74.92 → 81.32] protection for AI produced works in the U.S. actually kind of interesting yeah raises a lot of questions
[81.32 → 86.44] that raises more questions than it answers i think yeah, yeah like when is he ever going to roll the intro
[86.44 → 88.12] who knows
[88.12 → 112.94] and the show is brought to you by Linde ubiquity and mechanical keyboards
[112.94 → 121.24] we should do a straw poll at some point to see what percentage of people that did buy the steam
[121.24 → 127.82] deck have received their email oh I'm super down i just saw a bunch of people post in the chat like
[127.82 → 131.82] haven't received my email haven't received my email and I'm really wondering because like
[131.82 → 137.66] uh i like I've told you i ordered mine during the show yeah i have not received my email
[137.66 → 145.80] and i suspect like a lot of people haven't I mean i suspect that they have pre-sold
[145.80 → 151.50] literally millions of units and i also suspect that finished units are going to be rolling out in
[151.50 → 157.88] batches of thousands yeah not hundreds of thousands not even tens of thousands i would be i would be very
[157.88 → 165.46] surprised if they're able to ship even one million units at once so in float plane chat i signed up a
[165.46 → 171.76] month ago I'm getting my email in 2025 well pretty much especially with everything that's going on right now right
[171.76 → 177.14] yes yeah so let's go ahead I'm going to hit the float plane chat with this poll first book it a
[177.14 → 180.24] book book book you guys got it twitch has got it
[180.24 → 188.62] and I'm going to make a commitment to you guys because it's been a little while since this has happened
[188.62 → 195.48] I'm going to make it through an entire wand show without saying or doing anything controversial
[195.48 → 202.34] okay that's right I've had enough controversy in my life and this is going to be the most
[202.34 → 210.16] mild-mannered timid Linus that you have seen in a very long time okay why don't we start with a
[210.16 → 216.26] non-controversial discussion about the steam deck it's officially launched and the consensus
[216.26 → 224.76] is that so far it's awesome uh polygon says the steam deck is my new favourite console Gizmodo says
[224.76 → 231.04] valve steam deck is a glorious but unfinished dream console digital foundry console quality
[231.04 → 236.70] handheld gaming believe it the steam deck is incomplete says Linus tech tips wait what
[236.70 → 241.38] am I quoting my own publication actually pretty interesting that's the most ridiculous thing I've
[241.38 → 245.46] ever seen very meta Anthony is the one who put it in here though so it doesn't count as me quoting
[245.46 → 252.38] myself but what i meant by all that is when you say it is that the software is both polished and
[252.38 → 259.62] unpolished depending on where you look because objectively speaking it is not finished yeah yeah
[259.62 → 264.42] yeah by all means okay hold on first let me put away let me put away this thing uh i
[264.42 → 269.02] haven't seen the software at all because when he handed it to me on the show uh i think it was off
[269.02 → 272.92] yeah yeah there's nothing on the screen you weren't allowed to see it yet yeah so you are on the home
[272.92 → 278.20] screen right now so I'm going to talk through the good while Luke sits here and uh twiddles his thumbs
[278.20 → 283.68] thumbs and haws yeah the good the handheld mode UI is intuitive and functional with excellent
[283.68 → 288.78] integration with the steam platform that makes Nintendo look old-fashioned uh Anthony has a little
[288.78 → 294.20] note in here they are old-fashioned, and you can't convince me otherwise that's fair Anthony Nintendo
[294.20 → 301.78] manages to deliver next-gen gaming experiences while living 10 to 20 years in the past like i just
[301.78 → 306.24] don't I don't know how they do it they must have like a time machine it's really kind of there are
[306.24 → 311.72] plenty of useful features like a tweakable performance overlay provided by mango HUD it is
[311.72 → 317.98] so cool like you can actually see frame times in real time okay it's freaking awesome sweet the steam
[317.98 → 323.72] store now has a great on deck section that makes it easy to quickly find titles that are well great
[323.72 → 330.16] on the steam deck and suspend and game save sync via steam cloud work awesome, but there's some bad
[330.16 → 335.56] stuff there are some minor Polish issues such as inconsistent selection wrapping the steam store
[335.56 → 340.68] doesn't yet have a good way to search for or filter titles that are compatible with not verified for
[340.68 → 347.54] the steam deck like the store doesn't have just like a complete list of titles that work well on
[347.54 → 353.50] steam deck which just is embarrassing frankly from my point of view steam cloud saves don't really work
[353.50 → 358.50] together with suspend in the way that valve intends to make them work in the future if what they've
[358.50 → 363.32] said is anything to go on and the underlying Linux OS makes itself known from time to time with
[363.32 → 370.00] catches and glitches that do in fact show up now some reviewers are dunking on the steam deck for
[370.00 → 376.16] having poor battery life at full bore, but others have managed to exceed valve's estimates via tweaking
[376.16 → 381.28] which is one of the biggest strengths that reviewers have praised the steam deck for its hackable it's
[381.28 → 387.36] hackable it's customizable it's a garden, but it is uncalled anyone can go in there and just
[387.36 → 398.64] plant stuff, and it's freaking cool yeah Anthony you guy okay notable Linux hater Linus Sebastian from
[398.64 → 404.80] minus tech tips I'm reading this verbatim has even gone so far as to use the steam deck as his only pc
[404.80 → 410.96] for a month to prove this point and that starts today by the way oh so i recorded the video a couple
[410.96 → 418.56] of days ago obviously but i the video was released today so today is my commitment day i will be using
[418.56 → 424.72] the steam deck as my only computer for the next month okay uh I'm not at work so i guess we're
[424.72 → 431.20] not we're not recovering uh that halo rank uh nope okay no i will not be playing any Halo Infinite for
[431.20 → 436.72] the next bit unless a way of playing Halo Infinite on the steam deck miraculously shows up now okay hold
[436.72 → 443.36] on tell me something tell me something does stream count can I stream from my computer that i own
[443.36 → 448.32] because i brought up in the review that is a legitimate way to bridge the gap the compatibility
[448.32 → 454.00] gap i would say as long as it's like noted then yeah sure why not i want the community to tell me
[454.00 → 460.56] functionality of the device right it is, and it's awesome now i haven't played with steam remote play in
[460.56 → 468.00] a while so maybe this improvement happened a while ago but i don't know what kind of black magic valve
[468.00 → 475.60] and AMD have cooked up with this chip that is some impressively fast decode wow like the even sit you
[475.60 → 480.88] know how it used to be that you could sit in front of the machine that is actually running the game and
[480.88 → 486.24] have the handheld, and you could kind of you could kind of see the jello change change like
[486.24 → 495.36] kind of like that no dog it's perfect it's perfect they say remote play only no parsec
[496.08 → 501.12] okay of course that's one of the selling points okay so yes, yes i I'm allowed to play Halo Infinite
[501.12 → 505.28] as long as I'm removing into my computer that's another thing that was really noticeable uh notable
[505.28 → 509.04] about the steam deck and this didn't make it into the review because it was already i think like 20
[509.04 → 515.44] minutes long oh my goodness i have to cut something and that's that the remote play experience on the steam
[515.44 → 523.52] deck is just perfect you know what else is nice it's one hold on let me see it's one
[526.48 → 533.76] two three four button presses to exit a game no going back to main menu if the game developer wants
[533.76 → 539.76] you to go look at their splash screen again alt f4 equivalent yeah it cool the game is closed yeah
[540.32 → 546.32] very nice i really like so something i immediately noticed was I i launched into to doom i believe
[546.32 → 553.60] this is doom 2016 um, and it showed i think while it was like installing some like compatibility
[553.60 → 558.32] layer stuff it showed the controls that i should expect to use for the game yep i actually think
[558.32 → 565.04] that's awesome super very cool it reminded me of the arcade system upstairs that will like light up
[565.04 → 569.04] or it's supposed to whatever it would light up the controls that you're supposed to use for the game
[569.04 → 574.72] it just removes like potential confusion i think that's great absolutely it's super cool this is
[574.72 → 580.80] reminding me that i suck at shooters on controller, but it feels great yeah i played a little bit of
[580.80 → 587.92] Halo Infinite quick play and i managed to get three kills one death before i was like okay that's enough of
[587.92 → 596.08] this image quality wasn't great scaling down 4k to 720p um not amazing i didn't test running the
[596.08 → 601.76] desktop at 1080 to see if okay maybe it would make some more accurate guesses text was basically unreadable
[601.76 → 607.36] though so it was pretty rough i didn't want to focus on i didn't want to focus on that use case for the
[607.36 → 612.64] initial review because and this was something that i really struggled with in the lead up to releasing
[612.64 → 620.64] the video about it because we had gone from this very sort of uh structured uh planned information
[620.64 → 627.12] release that valve was working towards where they've got they had the early hands-on than
[627.12 → 635.12] they had the hardware review, and honestly they did an amazing job of being as open as as as i think is
[635.12 → 641.60] reasonable for us to ask as the media while also setting reasonable rules for what's allowed and what's
[641.60 → 645.68] not at each stage of the game like the fact that they allowed me to pull out the thermal camera
[645.68 → 650.80] at that early hands-on pretty surprising that's astounding i was fully expecting them to say
[650.80 → 657.76] um are you effing serious mate and making me put away put it away right yeah like they've been super cool
[657.76 → 666.16] about this whole experience but what that meant was that finally once the guardrails were off
[666.16 → 676.24] there were so many different angles that i could take on this that i couldn't possibly conceivably have
[676.24 → 681.28] enough time to cover all of them even though we had a solid two weeks and there are a couple of things
[681.28 → 689.76] that contributed to that one is that there's just no matter how deeply knowledgeable you are about
[689.76 → 696.00] computers and computer hardware you can't possibly know everything about every angle of this device so the
[696.00 → 703.04] way that i decided to tackle it was as a console here's the game here's the list of published games
[703.04 → 709.04] here's the store where you buy the games here's the experience of playing the games and because we'd already
[709.04 → 714.96] reviewed the hardware i was able to focus on the software experience and how it ties all of that together
[714.96 → 720.00] but there are other ways you could have reviewed it i mean desktop mode was already enabled
[720.00 → 725.04] you could have reviewed it as really i mean this is a really great point that Anthony has in his notes here
[725.04 → 728.16] and one that i wanted to include in the video but like i said i just ran out of time
[728.96 → 733.12] you could review it as just the most potent
[734.96 → 742.96] just computer in its class it's 400 dollars for a quad-core sent APU that's crazy with run a2 graphics
[742.96 → 750.24] 16 gigs of ram, and it does technically have a screen, and it even has a screen on it, you can plug
[750.24 → 754.40] a keyboard and mouse super easy and just literally operate off of that, and it wouldn't be like the
[754.40 → 759.12] the greatest experience ever, but it'd be fine it'd be fun you add a monitor in and now yeah whatever like
[759.12 → 764.56] holy smokes yeah it's a super affordable computer sweet uh another way that you could tackle it is you
[764.56 → 769.92] could you could focus on it from an emulation enthusiast perspective for sure getting emulated i mean the
[769.92 → 775.52] fox has already got follow-up videos up on his channel focusing on it as an emulation device
[775.52 → 783.92] and that's a super cool use case for it because similar to the Roneo uh next which is my other
[783.92 → 790.16] favourite handheld right now it's got enough power that you could actually run like switch emulators on
[790.16 → 797.20] this thing like that's super cool that makes it capable of running basically every retro console PS3 and
[797.20 → 803.52] down for people that missed out on the Wii U era this is the best way to emulate Wii U because it
[803.52 → 809.68] like actually matches the controller absolutely right super cool so there's just so many ways that
[809.68 → 816.64] you can tackle a device like this and i just couldn't realistically cover it all and contributing to that
[816.64 → 823.84] inability to cover every possible angle was the fact that valve kept changing things so that's really
[823.84 → 831.52] where a lot of my incomplete angle came from was because by valve's own admission like both in the lead
[831.52 → 838.56] up to the hardware review and the software review i said look i need a commitment from you guys
[840.00 → 847.84] for some kind of like date that we can lock down and say okay we are reviewing it as of this is the experience
[847.84 → 855.44] so we can freeze it and review it in that state, and they were like while i understand that
[856.00 → 862.72] to produce videos takes time we can't do that because we've got hundreds of development units out
[862.72 → 868.56] there and developers, and we're rolling fixes like they have been rolling fixes every other day sometimes
[868.56 → 876.64] even multiple times in a single day I've seen things it really does and all of that is in service of
[876.64 → 882.16] their goal to try to make this as good an experience as possible for launch but what that also means
[882.16 → 889.12] is that valve acknowledges that this thing ain't fully cooked yet so that was really where that angle
[889.12 → 897.28] came from and so that really interfered with my ability to write and shoot this review so i actually
[897.28 → 903.44] pulled my first all-nighter in a very, very long time in order to make sure that our coverage of the
[903.44 → 910.16] steam deck would be as up to date as possible, and it's still missed it so the fact that it was
[910.16 → 918.32] co-hosted by me and Jake that was because one i made a mistake on well one or two things uh because i
[918.32 → 924.88] was writing this in like a fugue state at you know between one and seven in the morning you stayed up till
[924.88 → 931.84] seven i stayed up till 7 30 in the morning yeah oh my goodness and part of it was that valve actually
[931.84 → 940.40] dropped more updates on us the day that i shot it so i was standing there i was literally standing
[940.40 → 945.76] there on set, so this is on to give you an idea of how tight this timeline was for this video hold on
[945.76 → 950.16] let's go back here uh no don't see one question while you're looking that up yeah did you post the
[950.16 → 957.20] straw poll link on all three platforms i did okay i did uh okay so hold on let's go back to my march view
[957.20 → 968.64] so on the morning of the 23rd so that is two days ago so on the night of the 22nd i stayed up till 7 30
[968.64 → 974.80] in the morning going okay i want this as close to embargo as possible so that we can include as much
[974.80 → 981.04] as possible as obviously I'd made little notes here and there but if i had nitpicky complaints or
[981.04 → 986.56] little things that i absolutely loved or even a game that i was really enjoying i needed to make
[986.56 → 992.24] sure that nothing was going to change in the proton updates they were pushing or the OS that was even
[992.24 → 997.92] a big problem they were pushing the Linux videos we made it was a huge by the time those videos went
[997.92 → 1003.44] live like so much stuff had changed games were magically compatible or not compatible yeah exactly
[1003.44 → 1009.52] yeah so i stayed up on the 20 night of the 22nd i shot on the morning of the 23rd and that video came
[1009.52 → 1018.48] out the morning of the 25th can can we just like to take a moment to bravo the freaking team here because
[1018.48 → 1023.84] to be honest with you guys i shot the roll and then i effed off on a ski trip I've been gone for
[1023.84 → 1029.60] the last couple of days so everything else that happened all the pickups all the b-roll all the fixes
[1029.60 → 1035.60] was all the team staying back here getting it done while i was on the slopes and hanging out in the hot
[1035.60 → 1041.92] springs awesome um so hold on let me just see so here's the email that i received while i was
[1041.92 → 1056.40] standing on set uh press update Wednesday night nope hold on where's uh so funny LY you are hilarious
[1056.40 → 1063.36] okay two days ago uh yeah at 9 59 in the morning hi all just a quick update uh we've had a few questions
[1063.36 → 1067.60] about cloud gaming through a browser there's a controller issue there's a fix in the pipe we've
[1067.60 → 1076.32] uh, uh oh no, no hold on there was an earlier one on Wednesday sorry there was one at 9am on Wednesday
[1076.32 → 1081.92] uh happy Wednesday uh we are around 48 hours from launch hope you're doing well everyone is heads down
[1081.92 → 1085.60] at this point polishing the last few rough edges we've shipped a couple of updates in the last few days
[1085.60 → 1089.04] and i wanted to let you know what's changed in case it will impact your coverage or testing
[1089.04 → 1095.76] so this is literally 48 hours from launch great on deck store page when you go to the store on deck
[1095.76 → 1099.52] there's a new landing page called great on deck fortunately i stayed up till the middle of the
[1099.52 → 1102.88] night because that's when that rolled out to me otherwise i would have had a whole section
[1102.88 → 1108.00] complaining about how the store doesn't have anywhere to see items that are great on yeah because they
[1108.00 → 1113.04] they said there was going to be so it makes sense okay uh multiple app switching we added support
[1113.04 → 1117.36] for switching between multiple running applications through the steam menu oh well that's non-trivial
[1117.36 → 1121.28] uh this is great for playing a game while listening to music chatting with friends or even playing
[1121.28 → 1128.88] another indie game in the background uh one small artistic license um that we took in the video was
[1128.88 → 1133.76] that the call that Jake accidentally made to me in the middle of the night was actually a call that
[1133.76 → 1139.20] i accidentally made to Luke in the middle of the night but for a number of reasons Jake had to reshoot
[1139.20 → 1146.24] that section so we changed the story uh so i had i didn't realize on Tuesday night just how
[1146.24 → 1152.08] flipping late it was and i was just like oh you know what i haven't even i haven't even
[1152.08 → 1157.60] tried this voice chat feature and i really want a trusted third party to tell me how good the mic is
[1157.60 → 1163.76] because um that that's honestly just the most convenient way for me to to to make a call as to
[1163.76 → 1169.92] like how usable this is and like play around with like in-game volume on the fly and be like okay how
[1169.92 → 1174.24] about now how about now how about now like getting that real-time feedback, and so I'm just
[1174.24 → 1182.00] like oh who's on oh I'll call Luke, and it wasn't until like midway through the call something like
[1182.00 → 1185.20] i think that i was like it is 1 30 in the morning
[1187.12 → 1192.40] i just completely unannounced called Luke at 1 30 in the morning i was trying to figure what the heck was
[1192.40 → 1199.60] going on because you called me on steam i have never in my life been called on steam um so like
[1199.60 → 1204.40] actually for a decent amount of time i actually had no idea it was happening and then figured out
[1204.40 → 1209.52] that it was coming from steam which was confusing, and then it was you so i was like
[1211.12 → 1216.80] what maybe he's tried on every other platform yeah like it's urgent it's an emergency did I miss the
[1216.80 → 1222.16] phone like what it's one in the morning what's happening, and then he's just like hey man I'm
[1222.16 → 1232.48] gaming on steam deck like okay i was playing this really cool RPG demo yeah um funny and we yeah yeah
[1232.48 → 1239.92] yeah chat's like you can call on steam right yeah, and it was pretty good it was perfect i was super
[1239.92 → 1246.72] impressed yeah it's weird really impressed the the the compression was not very noticeable compared
[1246.72 → 1253.04] to discord like should we just switch to steam voice chat for honestly for like remote wan
[1253.04 → 1258.64] shows it might be a good idea because like you said it did sound clear it sounded perfect yeah i
[1258.64 → 1263.68] i don't know um it's like video might be an issue but that it was I was very impressed
[1263.68 → 1268.88] um something I'm not necessarily super impressed about is straw polls apparently having some serious
[1268.88 → 1276.24] issues um it's no longer updating, and the votes are not counting in more we're capped at 374 votes
[1276.72 → 1285.04] uh out of those 374 it says that 100 were no but i have also watched straw poll before if you like
[1285.04 → 1290.96] rapidly update it will only add some to like one column, and then it will only add to the other column
[1290.96 → 1297.84] and go back and forth so uh as much as it would be like an interesting story to say that 100 of people
[1297.84 → 1306.56] were answering no i don't think we can trust that at all um so that sucks, but it is what it is but yeah
[1306.72 → 1312.56] so the voice chat was really great um i forget where i was going with this story oh yeah right i
[1312.56 → 1318.88] wasn't through the list of things that that changed 48 hours before launch uh as mentioned in yesterday's
[1318.88 → 1324.32] update you can add non-steam apps to the deck UI like chrome discord Spotify and more from the desktop
[1324.32 → 1329.84] oh yeah pretty minor thing uh new in-game overlay oh there's a new in-game overlay new startup animation
[1329.84 → 1333.12] sound players can now change device name players can now remove non-steam shortcuts from their libraries
[1333.12 → 1336.32] UI performance improvements to the account panel for offline mode improve navigation
[1336.32 → 1340.96] for what's new events timing updates for suspend resume flow storing out displays tool tips and a
[1340.96 → 1346.48] bunch of bug fixes so it's just like a massive version upgrade, but these were rolling like every
[1346.48 → 1353.76] other day that's crazy and so covering this thing has been an incredible challenge it's been unlike
[1353.76 → 1360.80] almost anything that I've ever done before but while it made it more difficult it also made me so much more
[1360.80 → 1367.36] excited for it like it's the same way that tesla owners will get just so jacked when tesla rolls a
[1367.36 → 1373.92] fart sound update or something like that it's not how you know important that update is to your daily
[1373.92 → 1381.20] life right it's that this product it feels like it's evolving in your very hands and there's a lot of
[1381.20 → 1390.08] care exactly, exactly like the amount of passion that I've seen just the responsiveness to not just
[1390.08 → 1396.72] emails but to technical issues like leading up to our hardware preview the performance dashboard was
[1396.72 → 1404.32] broken, and we were like well um this is going to be a problem and there were clearly engineers like
[1405.04 → 1411.28] on it immediately i don't think we've ever gotten engineering support from a company like this before
[1411.28 → 1413.44] like ever like we had a problem
[1417.12 → 1421.92] getting the main for like it really did feel that way though because we would have serious issues and they
[1421.92 → 1428.96] would turn around a fix like so quickly and i know, and you know what it's like developing software
[1428.96 → 1437.68] yeah it's not a 24-hour turnaround no unless it's a very trivial thing right yeah so clearly they have been all
[1437.68 → 1442.00] hands on deck leading up there's also there are some interesting things to potentially be said about
[1442.00 → 1449.20] um valves like workplace culture um how they are extremely flat for the vast majority of the company
[1449.20 → 1455.76] not technically all of it but the vast majority of the company um, and you can sort of decide to work
[1455.76 → 1460.40] on whatever you want but if you pick something you have to take ownership of that thing and like all
[1460.40 → 1466.72] this kind of stuff i bet you there's a lot of ownership take on steam deck absolutely i bet you valve
[1466.72 → 1472.32] actually just like cares a lot internally oh i think they're very skilled and big team working
[1472.32 → 1475.92] on its something i really wanted to be included in the video by the way check this out check this out i
[1475.92 → 1479.76] did this demo in the video, so this isn't new for them, I'm just gonna I'm just going to put this to sleep
[1480.56 → 1484.56] holy crap that was fast incredible right I'm just going to wake it up
[1486.72 → 1493.04] i am back in the game that's great freaking amazing I'm playing I'm now playing the game again
[1493.04 → 1500.80] unreal right yeah sorry doom not unreal funny joke yeah that doesn't remind me of sleep on windows
[1501.36 → 1508.88] at all ever i think that valve sees this as an existential problem to solve and I'm I'm gonna
[1508.88 → 1514.00] defend that I'm going to defend that not because valve is at any danger of running out of money
[1514.00 → 1521.28] or because valve's money printing machine is going to run dry anytime soon right but for a valve to be
[1521.28 → 1529.36] perceived as a different kind of company than what say for example epic games is running with the epic
[1529.36 → 1536.80] game store this was the next step, and it's clear that this has been in their sights for a long time oh yeah
[1536.80 → 1546.40] we just are not big brain enough to have seen it every thing they've done everything they've done in the last 10 years
[1546.40 → 1554.72] the last 10 years lands here seriously big picture steam controller in home streaming which is now
[1554.72 → 1562.80] called remote play even steam VR to a certain degree everything brings us to this to valve wanting
[1562.80 → 1571.76] to be a platform company as opposed to a store and this if I'm a developer and there was a perfect
[1571.76 → 1578.24] chat in float plane um asking how many units do you think valve has to sell before developers seriously
[1578.24 → 1583.76] start to target Linux and start to target the steam deck if I'm a developer and I'm salty about
[1583.76 → 1596.16] valves 30 take all of a sudden it's validated i see this as such a game changer that for certain types of
[1596.16 → 1601.20] games controller first portable first games they get enough of an installation base out there
[1602.40 → 1607.20] so what i could go an epic game store and still pretty brutal it's pretty brutal, but it's on par
[1607.20 → 1612.96] with what Microsoft and Sony are doing I'm not saying it's not on par i think that you can
[1612.96 → 1619.28] sustain yourself at that if valve provides you with an installation base and promotes the game like if they
[1619.28 → 1626.24] take on more of a console manufacturer role right as opposed to just being a big fat download pipe right
[1626.24 → 1632.96] and some community services that arguably were left to rot for a very long time for years actually before
[1632.96 → 1642.40] they started to kind of wake-up to some competition yeah so i see this as a significant evolution
[1642.40 → 1649.92] in valve's business where they go from being a storefront to being a game console manufacturer
[1650.56 → 1656.64] apparently there was an update for q1 shipping details that was posted uh today at 3 pm
[1658.00 → 1663.52] happy launch day we've seen some questions about what it means to be in the q1 reservation group
[1663.52 → 1669.20] and when folks will receive their emails, so this might answer our poll that didn't work here's how it
[1669.20 → 1674.48] breaks down all people who are in the q1 reservation uh window on the steam deck store page will receive
[1674.48 → 1680.48] an order email by the end of March q1 is quarter one so it goes through march the first batch of emails
[1680.48 → 1685.28] has already gone out this morning so if you're in the first batch you have received your email already
[1685.28 → 1691.68] uh the next batch of emails will go up monday, March 7th it turns out logistics work out better if we
[1691.68 → 1696.88] don't try to ship over a weekend that i mean that makes sense uh we'll continue sending emails to q1
[1696.88 → 1703.04] reserves in order of their reservations um, and they're going to be done on a weekly basis March 14th
[1703.04 → 1711.84] 21st 28th in April we'll start going through q2 q in similar fashion okay, so there's the update and guys
[1711.84 → 1721.92] if you're is you're in the queue be excited it's not complete, but it's super cool uh you know
[1721.92 → 1728.32] what actually i kind of have a funny story to tell about this in my rush to get the video
[1728.32 → 1733.92] written i actually forgot that i had already done some of the work i had run into a similar issue
[1733.92 → 1739.76] when i was working on the hardware review where i just kind of wasn't really sure exactly how to
[1739.76 → 1744.72] tackle it on the one hand we weren't able to say everything that we wanted to say because the software
[1744.72 → 1748.96] was still embargoed, and we were only allowed to run certain games and all that and valve did a great job
[1748.96 → 1753.84] of providing enough and enough variety of games that we were able to do everything we needed to do
[1753.84 → 1760.64] so good guy valve there um but i was really struggling to figure out what this video was
[1761.20 → 1767.60] i even considered just trying to say everything that i could say without breaking embargo and making
[1767.60 → 1773.20] it the one video we did because i felt like the software was changing so fast and was going to
[1773.20 → 1776.88] continue to change so fast that there wasn't wouldn't really be anything for me to say about it
[1776.88 → 1783.28] so i ended up writing an intro for the hardware video that i kind of went no we're going to make
[1783.28 → 1786.80] the hardware video just the hardware and i think there's enough to say about the software that we're
[1786.80 → 1791.60] going to do a dedicated video about the software but i think it was a really great intro that i wrote
[1791.60 → 1798.16] so i was like oh I'll just use this for the software video because i feel like what i didn't do in
[1798.16 → 1805.76] the version that we uploaded was frame who i am and why i care about any of this and why
[1806.32 → 1811.12] I'm tackling it from the perspective that i am so here's what i wrote that was supposed to be the
[1811.12 → 1816.40] intro of the video that we uploaded this morning the first time i experienced handheld pc gaming was
[1816.40 → 1822.72] 11 days after Linus media group began operating as an independent company the NVIDIA shield used the
[1822.72 → 1828.24] same low latency hardware video encode and decode pipeline that powers giant cloud gaming services like
[1828.24 → 1833.76] PlayStation now Google Stadia and Xbox cloud gaming that is to say the onboard firepower was only capable of
[1833.76 → 1839.36] playing casual android games but by borrowing the power of a nearby gaming rig pc games could be
[1839.36 → 1844.16] streamed to it over Wi-Fi this little guy got me through many a sleepless night actually still own
[1844.16 → 1848.32] my original NVIDIA shield got me through many a sleepless night sitting in the nursery with my
[1848.32 → 1853.76] firstborn where i fell in love with both of them steam big picture had just launched and NVIDIA
[1853.76 → 1860.32] announced partnerships with game developers including valve did you remember that that would see major
[1860.32 → 1866.32] that would be a good idea of the new console i foresaw a period of disruption and rapid innovation in
[1866.32 → 1870.88] handheld pc gaming that would give us bigger screens faster networking and improved ergonomics
[1871.68 → 1877.68] i got it wrong or at least i got all the details wrong the innovation wouldn't be fast and the
[1877.68 → 1881.92] disruptor wouldn't be NVIDIA and the shield is a boring box for watching Netflix now
[1881.92 → 1887.36] in fact it flopped so hard that NVIDIA not only never built a successor oh no this was an alternate
[1887.36 → 1892.48] to that paragraph uh they gave its name away to a more practical product their android TV box the shield
[1892.48 → 1901.12] wasn't bad it was just almost 10 years too early and this is its replacement and so yeah it took
[1901.12 → 1908.48] nine what is it nine years no almost 10 years it took over nine years to go from my first experience
[1908.48 → 1916.48] of handheld pc gaming to pcs reaching the point where they can be this thin this small, and you don't
[1916.48 → 1925.20] even need to rely on a nearby pc to run the games it's just absolutely phenomenal so when you do
[1925.20 → 1931.52] your like i switched thing yeah this is that going to be one video is that going to be weekly videos i think
[1931.52 → 1936.24] it'll be one video okay yeah just one video I'm going to switch to it for a month and that's going to
[1936.24 → 1942.24] affect my gaming choices like one thing that happened one of the things i screwed up was that
[1942.24 → 1951.52] uh based on a based on a third party list of steam deck compatible games i thought that fable was
[1951.52 → 1958.48] steam deck compatible and i talked in the video about how i was really excited for that because fable is
[1959.36 → 1964.40] uh i don't know if i it's been so long since I've played it that it's hard to say if it would still
[1964.40 → 1970.64] hold up in this way for me, but it is one of my favourite games the first one um launch fable
[1970.64 → 1975.20] anniversary, and so i talked about how like that's one of the first games I'm going to play as part of
[1975.20 → 1982.00] my switch to steam deck and unfortunately Jake who was busy doing the work of validating everything
[1982.00 → 1990.08] that i wrote when i was like this at my computer i turned my i turned my ole duh 48 inch down to like
[1990.08 → 1995.28] three percent brightness because i just couldn't handle anything more than that everything dark
[1995.28 → 2001.60] mode three percent brightness uh so when Jake went to validate it he found that well everything looks
[2001.60 → 2008.48] great okay and that's just that's just pre pre-rendered videos uh yeah this too appears to be
[2008.48 → 2021.44] pre-rendered uh okay this isn't this is clearly in engine right okay continue game that all looks great
[2022.64 → 2031.04] and loading time surprisingly good for micro SD, although it is an older game
[2031.04 → 2041.20] oops you guys can probably you guys can probably see the screen artifacts all over everything from here
[2042.80 → 2048.80] check this out it's like it's fable in the matrix see that pretty good yeah that's not great yeah not
[2048.80 → 2054.16] a great gaming i was wondering what that was when you first brought out yeah the steam deck at the
[2054.16 → 2059.20] beginning of the show yeah and i saw all the sparkles and i thought it was some like uh like SNES like
[2059.20 → 2063.04] space game or something i thought you were emulating something i didn't realize it was
[2063.04 → 2072.16] graphical artifacts yeah yeah it's pretty nasty so either I'll play it like this which i won't yeah
[2073.36 → 2077.84] or i will find something else to play and that's going to be my month as I'll be playing games that run
[2077.84 → 2083.20] on the steam deck and talking about how that feels as as as a console
[2083.20 → 2091.04] once I'm done with it, i do still find that i prefer the ergonomics
[2092.08 → 2099.04] of the IA neo okay because it doesn't take up room where for the pads that i don't know
[2099.04 → 2104.88] how much I'm gonna use as someone who does have a full-sized computer but I'm gonna I'm going to have
[2104.88 → 2109.04] to see you on the road I'm going to have to see if i I'm going to have to see if i get used to that well I'm going to be
[2109.04 → 2112.64] testing it on the road as one of the first things i do with it because I'm actually headed to new
[2112.64 → 2117.52] York in a couple of days okay so I'll be bringing it with me, I'll be playing with it on the plane
[2117.52 → 2122.64] and I'm I'm super I'm super excited to steam deck it up over the next over the next month
[2125.68 → 2130.88] right i didn't talk about the critical mass that i think we have to hit for game developers to
[2130.88 → 2136.00] specifically target the steam deck yeah and the steam platform as we will now know it
[2136.00 → 2142.88] i think that as soon as they hit that three to five i think five is kind of the magic number that
[2142.88 → 2147.12] i have in my head as soon as they've got five million steam decks out there i think we are
[2147.12 → 2150.80] going to see developers because the thing is you got to understand game development is not something
[2150.80 → 2156.88] that happens overnight you don't see oh valve moved half a million steam decks in the first quarter
[2158.00 → 2165.92] and go this is definitely a thing valve has never flubbed a yeah exactly
[2166.00 → 2171.84] right they've never flubbed an initiative before this is definitely going to have a lasting impact
[2171.84 → 2177.84] let's spend you know two years in development to build a game targeting this platform you know
[2177.84 → 2183.28] that's not going to happen i was going to say oh for me time is almost more important than total amount
[2183.28 → 2190.48] of shipments that's fair just because like we like you just mentioned valve has uh you know started
[2190.48 → 2197.36] projects and never iterated on them in the past uh that has happened many times so i would want to see
[2197.92 → 2208.88] valve continuing to work on it um i I'd love to see a leak of steam deck 2. yeah if i was a developer
[2208.88 → 2213.52] that would be a big moment for me and I'd be like okay cool i mean given how much it must have cost
[2214.24 → 2220.88] to get this custom silicon from AMD i don't think steam deck 2 is coming out like that's the thing
[2221.52 → 2227.84] if this was just using off-the-shelf components um steam deck 2 probably would already be in development
[2228.56 → 2234.80] but it's not i don't think it would be soon and so like a console the commitment that valve has made
[2234.80 → 2239.60] to how many units they have to sell to hit this kind of pricing because it would also have been priced
[2239.60 → 2244.88] way higher i don't think we're going to see an iteration on this for at least two to three
[2244.88 → 2250.08] years like there's just i just think outside of converting current games to being compatible
[2250.88 → 2256.80] you know doing that amount of work i don't see work originating for games specifically for the steam
[2256.80 → 2263.12] deck being worth it until i see a much more solid commitment long term from steam and I'm not trying
[2263.12 → 2268.32] to like fearmonger or dissuade people it's just i mean they've dropped a lot of stuff in the past
[2268.32 → 2273.12] and I'd want to see some more drive to see this through that's fair i think that's totally fair
[2274.80 → 2279.28] uh what else did we want to talk about with steam deck yeah i guess I've talked about sort of the
[2279.28 → 2284.56] the hellish experience of trying to cover this with up-to-date information um
[2285.92 → 2288.88] did you have any thoughts to share now that you're allowed to just say whatever you want about it
[2289.44 → 2294.88] no i felt good i still have the same kind of type of concern that i originally had with the
[2294.88 → 2301.20] thumb sticks but i also don't know of a device that is in that has that much room for thumb sticks that
[2301.20 → 2308.72] is better um so yeah i think that's fair that is what it is um yeah it feels pretty good keeping your
[2308.72 → 2315.04] pre-order yeah what do you plan to use it for because you mostly stay at home this is one of my
[2315.04 → 2320.72] like you know how i had every single prototype of the oculus headsets sure this is one of my like
[2320.72 → 2328.32] this feels like a fairly historical hardware launch got it so you want to experience it yeah yep i
[2328.32 → 2334.32] think so too i mean i said in the hardware review that i believe this is the most innovative pc in 20
[2334.32 → 2339.76] years and the only reason that i went with 20 years is because that's the time that I've been paying
[2339.76 → 2346.48] attention to computer hardware so to go back farther than that i would have to do a ton of
[2346.48 → 2351.76] research probably farther than that, but that was just from my own experience what i could say with
[2351.76 → 2357.76] confidence and this is also like but with how much I've seen it and i knew this when it was
[2357.76 → 2362.72] first announced this is something that I'm going to want to find excuses to use because i just find it
[2362.72 → 2368.32] so interesting and like the amount that they're updating and stuff that's that's very interesting to me
[2368.32 → 2374.16] i will follow the updates once i have one um I'm not going to follow them before then but like it's
[2374.16 → 2379.84] it's very exciting it's very interesting and i don't want to miss out on it which is why I'm
[2379.84 → 2386.56] going to keep the pre-order for sure speaking of not wanting to miss out ad spots oh yeah yeah we
[2386.56 → 2392.72] should probably talk about sponsors yeah the show today is brought to you by Linde
[2392.72 → 2400.56] Linde is a powerful Linux-based cloud computing service that's affordable and easy to use they have

[2440.08 → 2445.84] new account at linode.com wan the show is also brought to you by ubiquity oh hey it's those guys
[2445.84 → 2451.68] the u6 LR access point is a high performance access point that brings powerful four stream Wi-Fi 6 coverage
[2451.68 → 2456.08] to enterprise networks the u6 blends into the environment and can be mounted both indoors or
[2456.08 → 2460.64] outdoors thanks to its water and dust resistant exterior, and it can be set up in minutes and fully
[2460.64 → 2465.52] managed with the unified network web application or mobile app that really is the major selling
[2465.52 → 2470.24] point for ubiquity i mean we're using ubiquity here in the office we're using it at the gym we're using it
[2470.24 → 2478.16] in the lab it's just the management tools man don't sing me out so much please okay well that's one
[2478.16 → 2483.68] thing actually it doesn't I don't have that issue, so the door one does yeah it works great for me maybe
[2483.68 → 2488.08] it's that I'm here every day i don't know that might be it the point is it's the management tools
[2488.08 → 2495.60] that really sell it for us yeah and no software as a service ongoing costs once we buy the hardware
[2496.48 → 2501.20] they're like that's thank you for your money yeah, and they keep developing the software that's big
[2501.20 → 2508.16] because we've seen other solutions in that space have monthly costs, and it's so frustrating
[2508.16 → 2513.92] because it's like look if you want more money build something better and I'll be happy to buy it but
[2513.92 → 2520.24] don't brick or nerf my old stuff yeah or make me keep paying for it for walks or whatever
[2520.24 → 2526.96] i already paid you yeah i definitely respect that for sure so massive shout out to ubiquity

[2531.60 → 2537.20] brought to you by mechanical keyboards thank you mechanicalkeyboards.com you might not realize this
[2537.76 → 2543.60] but mechanicalkeyboards.com has a ton of mechanical keyboards what yeah they've got tons
[2544.08 → 2548.72] and switches and keycaps and much more for sale that's ridiculous that's right mechanicalkeyboards.com
[2548.72 → 2552.80] they got mechanical keyboards over there so if you're looking for a place to buy mechanical
[2552.80 → 2556.32] keyboards if you need a keyboard for your new steam deck ah shoot what's the site called again
[2556.96 → 2564.40] i can't remember muck MUC machine uh, uh mechanicalkeyboards.com that's the one thank you
[2564.40 → 2569.76] featured brands include tai hao ducky vermilion Mike and more, and you can check out their learning
[2569.76 → 2574.32] resources for information on switches boards and what layout might be right for you, they offer free
[2574.32 → 2579.44] shipping in the US and if you check them out and use code LTT at the link down below something might
[2579.44 → 2583.60] happen i don't know it doesn't say in my talking point so that's cool all right let's move on to
[2583.60 → 2588.32] our next big topic i have one quick note about the previous topic someone in uh flow plane chat shared
[2588.32 → 2596.56] a pc gamer article with me um talking about how valve is already planning uh steam deck 2
[2597.84 → 2601.76] apparently Gabe Newell has said in quote um
[2604.48 → 2610.08] speaking to edge magazine Newell was discussing valve's surprise uh when the most expensive version
[2610.08 → 2615.84] of the steam deck proved far and away uh to be the most popular version of the handheld uh and then
[2615.84 → 2620.24] in quote that makes that's why we always love to get something out there and ship it because we
[2620.24 → 2626.88] learn a lot from that, and it helps frame our thinking for deck two there you go pretty promising
[2626.88 → 2633.04] quote he's talking about framing thinking and stuff so i don't exactly think it's uh they are laser
[2633.04 → 2637.52] focused on deck one right now i can tell you that much that's what i was going to say like i don't
[2637.52 → 2643.04] i would assume they're not actually working on it yet um but I'm sure they're taking notes you know what
[2643.04 → 2650.00] what i mean yeah very exciting and i can tell you that their competitors aren't sitting still either
[2650.00 → 2659.12] uh I'm on WhatsApp with the CEO of AYA and I'm like hey so um steam deck pretty competitive and
[2660.32 → 2666.24] basically i mean i don't know if you know this but their Indiegogo went live i think yesterday or
[2666.24 → 2670.56] the day before, and they've already raised half a million dollars this is i was going to say i really hope
[2670.56 → 2676.96] um that this is one of those situations where a big dog entering the arena just adds legitimacy to
[2676.96 → 2682.24] the space as a whole and adds interest to alternative products as well because that would be cool i hope
[2682.24 → 2688.88] so too because i still think there's a place for what they're doing yeah i they have things that the
[2688.88 → 2695.44] steam deck doesn't uh hull sensor joysticks for one thing uh much better haptics than the steam deck which
[2695.44 → 2703.20] valve by their own admission didn't focus on um i would like to see someone come out with a OLED
[2703.20 → 2711.28] display um the Roneo next has zen three cores instead of zen two cores it's priced way higher but what that
[2711.28 → 2715.92] means to me when i look at how many backers have supported that project already is that there's
[2715.92 → 2723.84] absolutely going to be a market for not just more and less premium but differentiated devices because
[2723.84 → 2729.52] that's the thing about a handheld, and we've seen this in phones it's so much more personal for sure
[2729.52 → 2737.04] i think than a desktop computer than what like the size yeah i mean and then i think
[2737.04 → 2740.08] a lot of it's going to come in peripherals right how much money you want to spend on it right it
[2740.08 → 2747.04] doesn't really matter, but that's exactly it with these just like peripherals it's so personal yeah for
[2747.04 → 2754.00] me the grip of the steam deck it's just if I'm playing a racing game it's its a bit of a reach
[2754.00 → 2759.04] for me to hold the thumb stick here and my thumb will start to slip whereas if i had larger hands I'd be
[2759.04 → 2765.04] right here comfortably on it yeah the ionic and maybe this is just you know the market that they
[2765.04 → 2772.88] cater to more is this is in Asia it is designed for smaller this is my problem oh you can't really
[2772.88 → 2778.00] comfortably reach the paddles yeah so i have to like to claw my fingers in really hard to get to
[2778.00 → 2782.72] the paddles on the back because my natural resting position for my hands is like way over the vent
[2783.28 → 2790.24] um so i have to like claw in to be able to press these okay it's not even close to a game breaker
[2790.24 → 2797.28] yeah like i totally fine, but there's absolutely going to be a market for different devices for
[2797.28 → 2805.04] different people yeah and people will pay a huge premium for admittedly very similar performance
[2805.04 → 2810.64] between the neon ext and the steam deck for something that serves their purposes better yeah
[2812.16 → 2818.96] all right lets uh talk about the chip shortage could get worse turns out Ukraine supplies 90
[2818.96 → 2825.84] of the neon used in U.S. semiconductors um neon is a noble gas used by the lasers that etch silicon
[2825.84 → 2833.92] wafers no neon no laser no etch no tasty chips for pcs phones and cars when Russia previously invaded
[2833.92 → 2842.08] in 2014 uh preceding the Crimean annexation the price of neon shot up 600 percent making matters
[2842.08 → 2849.44] worse Russia supplies over 30 percent of global palladium is a rare platinum group metal used in
[2849.44 → 2854.00] semiconductors in many other industries including catalytic converters mobile phones and even dental
[2854.00 → 2860.08] fillings Ukraine and Russia also lead the world in production of metals like nickel copper platinum and iron
[2861.92 → 2867.92] oh i mean i don't think i have to explain what copper is used for in electronics when yeah when
[2867.92 → 2875.76] when the whole world is so linked and unified in global trade it's almost like war is bad yeah um
[2876.40 → 2882.40] hopefully that doesn't qualify as a hot take can we be on the same page about that hopefully i think
[2882.40 → 2888.32] the conversation reports that chipmakers currently hold two to four weeks of inventory reserve but
[2888.32 → 2893.68] prolonged supply disruption could severely impact production of semiconductors and everything else
[2893.68 → 2899.60] that depends on them and that is just the tech sector global food prices already on the rise are
[2899.60 → 2904.08] undoubtedly going to get worse as Ukraine and Russia together account for more than a quarter of global
[2904.08 → 2910.08] wheat exports wheat prices spiked sharply following the start of the war uh and while the US and Canada
[2910.08 → 2916.24] produce wheat countries like turkey and Egypt import 70 of their wheat from that region Ukraine is also
[2916.24 → 2921.60] the top supplier of corn to China global transportation networks have been disrupted by the rerouting of
[2921.60 → 2926.64] traffic around Ukraine and a non-zero amount of foreign shipping has already been attacked in the Black Sea
[2926.64 → 2932.48] including Turkish and Japanese transports natural gas and oil big exports for Russia which is now being
[2932.48 → 2938.40] limited by sanctions again Canada and the US are oil producers but much of Europe depends on the Russian supply
[2938.40 → 2945.36] if Russia gets ejected from the swift global banking network that's i think seen as a bit of uh, uh a red
[2945.36 → 2950.48] button to press yeah that's a big one this could seriously affect the ability of any entity to purchase
[2950.48 → 2955.20] Russian gas this is part of why especially Germany and Italy have been reluctant to support the move
[2955.20 → 2963.68] until recently time for Germany yes um bonus breaking news related micro story NVIDIA just got hit by a cyber
[2963.68 → 2969.92] attack, and it says that parts of its business are completely compromised according to the telegraph
[2969.92 → 2975.04] it is unclear if any data was stolen or deleted or if it was simply a disruption and security experts
[2975.04 → 2979.68] have concerns that something may have been attached to a driver slash software package there are no
[2979.68 → 2985.36] suspects, but this comes as Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine intensify i will also say there as far as I've
[2985.36 → 2991.44] seen are genuinely no suspects there is nothing painting this as a Russian cyberattack so yeah
[2992.00 → 3002.64] the timing is extremely suspect obviously yes, and it totally could be but like just you know yeah uh
[3002.64 → 3010.16] extra story anonymous leaks Russian ministry of defence database um yeah there's a lot sort of going
[3010.16 → 3014.88] on right now thank you Anthony it's almost like there's a war and there's a lot of news happening all at
[3014.88 → 3022.56] once on this subject yeah it's um it's its mostly like emails and names and stuff like that it's not
[3022.56 → 3027.92] it's not like you know when you say Russian military defence database you can make a lot of assumptions
[3027.92 → 3030.32] about what might be in there it's mostly emails and names
[3033.44 → 3040.96] yeah yep um again war bad that is going to be my take
[3040.96 → 3049.44] in other news uh trump launches truth social nice logo appears to be plagiarized perfect
[3051.20 → 3055.52] uh there's also some funny stuff like honestly i don't know how you get around things like this
[3056.24 → 3061.68] uh, but it's funny anyway uh when you set up an account you get put on a wait list
[3061.68 → 3068.00] um, and it says like uh you're not just another number to us but also here's your number uh because
[3068.00 → 3072.32] you're in a wait list uh which is again i don't know how you get around stuff like that
[3072.32 → 3080.64] um, but it's its just kind of funny um yeah uh should we talk about this at all so uh
[3080.64 → 3085.52] he got shut down everywhere else so he made his own app called truth social it launched on the Apple app
[3085.52 → 3094.00] store Monday at midnight um the rollout support has apparently been terrible uh just because the wait
[3094.00 → 3098.88] list is so long i think yeah apparently it should be fully operational by end of quarter but people
[3098.88 → 3104.32] are slowly getting on they're partnered with rumble uh many prominent right-wing personalities are
[3104.32 → 3111.04] already on their like Sean Hannity uh Dan Bongino and Charlie kirk the logo is very clearly ripped off
[3111.04 → 3117.12] from a British company trailer fleet telematics and fuel efficiencies here let's go ahead and
[3117.12 → 3125.44] uh i don't know i mean that's just a t i guess it's definitely similar very similar t great to see
[3125.44 → 3131.92] Donald Trump supporting a growing sustainability business oh it's uh it's very similar um it's its
[3131.92 → 3136.96] it's quite similar so they added a green block there's a little green dot yeah i mean they could
[3136.96 → 3145.84] have at least had the colour be different yikes okay anyway i mean at least it's not a speech that got
[3145.84 → 3156.48] ripped off you know uh for Michelle Obama yeah yeah okay cool so that's a thing that happened
[3156.48 → 3161.68] this week so i actually already have a hot take on this, so this isn't a new hot take I'm just going to
[3161.68 → 3167.92] reiterate my hot take i think that the biggest impediment to truth social is going to be that
[3167.92 → 3174.24] it's just going to be boring oh because it's very echo chamber i think that people want to argue
[3176.48 → 3184.00] and I've I've seen some I've seen some takes that are where I've seen people not agree with that and
[3184.00 → 3188.72] basically say look i mean you take a bunch of right-wingers or a bunch of left-wingers, and you put
[3188.72 → 3194.40] them all in uh in a room together they're just going to fight amongst themselves because those are
[3194.40 → 3197.84] the types of people who like to fight on the internet they're just going to fight on the internet
[3197.84 → 3202.80] and fight with someone uh so if you have uh you take a bunch of right-wingers then all of a sudden
[3202.80 → 3208.48] it's like you know root out the rhino right, or you take left-wingers it's like you are not woke enough
[3208.48 → 3214.72] you know you'll, they'll just find ways to divide amongst themselves into more right people
[3214.72 → 3221.44] seeking less right more left and less left speaking of the censorship stuff which i think is a
[3221.44 → 3226.56] conversation that comes up with true social these are a little bit off-topic but um
[3226.56 → 3232.40] censorship stuff around what's going on in Ukraine has been interesting yeah Facebook censored a bunch
[3232.40 → 3239.68] of different Russian news agencies um and Russia responded by i think fully or partially i don't have
[3239.68 → 3245.36] the notes in front of me so I'm sorry but fully or partially blocking uh Facebook in Russia um
[3246.00 → 3254.00] what it is it on here yeah it's topic oh okay i didn't actually know that uh Facebook where are you
[3255.60 → 3260.72] uh that's not what i typed you'll find it i believe in you there we go yeah Facebook
[3260.72 → 3267.20] censors Russian media gets blocked in Russia uh and then on the other end of the coin sort of um
[3267.20 → 3272.88] um and i definitely don't have the notes for this in front of me but uh the anonymous post
[3273.44 → 3279.28] that announced that they got the Russian defence database the first one that went out on Twitter
[3279.28 → 3285.76] which included a mega link for the download of it was removed by twitter because it violated twitter's
[3285.76 → 3290.56] policies tweet went back up without the mega link and then that has been allowed to stay
[3290.56 → 3299.68] so it's like it's its fascinating seeing how things sort of play out um yeah yeah
[3302.80 → 3307.44] the restrictions explaining Facebook meta apparently ignored the request hasn't publicly confirmed the
[3307.44 → 3311.60] actions it took against Russian media now the Russian government has partially blocked Facebook I'm not
[3311.60 → 3318.48] sure what partially blocked means yeah i mean either like i don't know what that functionally does Nicholas
[3318.48 → 3322.96] put a discussion question in here for us this isn't a question i just think it's hilarious that for
[3322.96 → 3328.72] the longest time Facebook refused to do anything at all about misinformation stateside uh particularly
[3329.36 → 3336.72] regarding that which targets um republicans and conservatives and is often coming from Russia
[3336.72 → 3342.88] but now Russia's misinformation is deemed bad and gets taken down who watches the watchmen uh Anthony's
[3342.88 → 3348.56] take on this the question has a hint of what about ism but is valid there really needs to be some kind
[3348.56 → 3352.40] of agreed upon standard by which misinformation is dealt with because the current system is not working
[3352.40 → 3361.28] that's 100 correct it's interesting man i mean everything it's funny like there's been a lot of
[3361.28 → 3367.60] discussion over the last few years really about how you know we're a tech show and why are we talking about
[3367.60 → 3375.84] politics or why are we talking about uh global events and the reality of it is tech is what binds this
[3375.84 → 3382.00] fragile society that we all live in together and the biggest sanction being held over this whole
[3382.00 → 3388.88] situation is swift which is a tech back end exactly and so it can also tear us apart and it just
[3390.16 → 3394.24] whether we like to or not all of a sudden we're kind of drawn into it because
[3394.24 → 3402.40] everything is tech to show me something that's not technology at this point in the world yeah
[3404.00 → 3411.12] that uh that that company that has a black and orange logo um shut down not i wouldn't say they
[3411.12 → 3416.24] shut down Russian access but they blocked it and they dumped you on a page with the Ukrainian flag
[3416.80 → 3424.08] which uh who is this black and orange logo company black and orange logo company nope not familiar um hub
[3424.72 → 3425.84] oh that one yeah
[3428.64 → 3434.64] did they really i genuinely don't know because i mean you know what I'm going for it, i mean you
[3434.64 → 3440.32] wouldn't see it uh oh hold on do i have Pia on here oh I've got it on my phone okay I'm going to try
[3441.84 → 3446.32] okay live we're we're trying to get on the hub hold on
[3446.32 → 3454.40] i wonder if i can even use an Ukraine endpoint VPN right now no it'd have to be Russian oh it'll have
[3454.40 → 3462.40] to be right oh well there's got to be a Russian oh nope there are no Russian endpoints really
[3462.40 → 3470.24] uh kind of makes sense at the moment uh okay yep
[3473.12 → 3479.36] nothing we got books or tech too yeah i mean if you want is you want to go down the chain there's a
[3479.36 → 3489.52] uh practically everything Kazakhstan language is tech no Russia and Israel is down
[3492.40 → 3497.60] okay then can anyone from Russia confirm that would be epic
[3497.60 → 3506.56] sanitary says very non-controversial today thank you i really am trying yeah i really am
[3506.56 → 3515.76] trying to be non-controversial today uh it's on some maybe lighter news um it's fake news oh that
[3515.76 → 3521.60] sucks okay i thought it was funny well then let's do some good news okay PlayStation VR we've got a new
[3521.60 → 3530.40] item on lttstore.com that's right if you love our CPU pillows, but you don't like that they are modelled
[3530.40 → 3540.32] after intel we now have a solution for you the CPU pillow team red edition that's right it's based on
[3540.32 → 3547.92] their am4 processors and is available in three different sizes there's our classic uh short
[3547.92 → 3553.60] circuit banana for scale so we've got a little tiny oh yeah Luke's got it is that that no where's
[3553.60 → 3560.80] that yeah there we go we got a little tiny tabletop one uh so it starts at 1999 then we've got a much
[3560.80 → 3566.00] larger sort of couch sized one oh no where's the medium-sized one what'd i do with it oh there it is
[3566.80 → 3572.08] we've got a medium-sized one that's like kind of decorative you put it on a shelf or whatever and
[3572.08 → 3577.76] then we've got a couch sized one, and you can see there's some new details in it so you got
[3577.76 → 3584.16] your heat spreader here you've got your uh you've got your package right here then you've got your pins
[3584.16 → 3592.00] on the bottom that's right Lloyd worked long and hard to sort of represent pins in pillow form i think
[3592.00 → 3599.60] he pretty much nailed it here so we are launching the team red edition version um i thought
[3599.60 → 3604.24] it was pretty funny i guess this could be like a hemorrhoid pillow oh yeah this is not a medical
[3604.24 → 3609.28] device i am not a medical professional but i could see how that there was someone in flow plane chat
[3609.28 → 3613.76] today at the beginning of the show that asked like why isn't there like secret pocket more
[3613.76 → 3620.96] representative pillow versions from AMD and i was like boy do we ever have a surprise for you got an
[3620.96 → 3625.52] announcement why is there a hole in the middle of the AMD pillow not intel's because intel's is flat on
[3625.52 → 3631.68] the bottom and AMD's has pins around and then has a blank spot in the bottom so we wanted to represent
[3631.68 → 3639.92] the uh the team red CPU uh design as best as we could yeah do the water bottle fit in
[3639.92 → 3644.48] the small pillow hole no i can't say that it does the pillows the pillow hole is pretty small here's a
[3644.48 → 3649.92] here's a pretty good look at it right here, so there's a pair of AirPods in the 15x15 one and then
[3649.92 → 3653.92] do we have a picture of the pillow there you go so it's a little bigger on that one oh, oh for crying
[3653.92 → 3659.76] out loud okay it totally do you just have to get a big enough pillow are you planning an epic
[3659.76 → 3665.68] addition with 100 alpaca wool filling um the alpaca wool the 100 alpaca wool one has generated
[3665.68 → 3670.48] complaints about the smell it does go away like if you just leave it outside not outside like in the
[3670.48 → 3676.08] rain obviously but if you like to leave it in the sun or let it air out for a week and a half the
[3676.08 → 3681.60] smell does go away, but it's created enough initial complaints from people who don't want to wait a
[3681.60 → 3686.80] week for their pillow to not stink um that we probably won't do another all alpaca wool run so
[3686.80 → 3692.16] if you want to get an extreme edition or excuse me an expensive edition pillow then that's going to be
[3692.16 → 3701.76] it that's that's the one that's our neo should we do some uh should we do some uh alerts yeah merch
[3701.76 → 3707.28] messages yeah we should or should we do that last topic first uh sure i was going to do like a kind
[3707.28 → 3712.48] of intermediate oh sure let's let's do a couple merge messages than uh Chris l says what would you
[3712.48 → 3718.48] change about the ATX standard or how computers are built today for me, it's the GPU power cable ugly and
[3718.48 → 3725.20] chunky i mean that's something apple fixed with um with the mac pro just running it uh through the extra
[3725.20 → 3730.08] pins that they have on the back of the PCI Express lot well i don't know that I'd want to take up PCB
[3730.08 → 3736.08] space for that what would I what would you change I'm trying to think yeah i um
[3738.88 → 3745.20] i don't know it's pretty functional yeah I'm sort of partial to like uh double-sided PCBs like
[3745.76 → 3750.16] there's that really cool board from i forget who makes it we did a video about it a little while back
[3750.16 → 3756.08] where the CPU socket's actually on the back so i think that if there was a commitment to a form
[3756.08 → 3761.84] factor like that where the CPU and memory is all like flat mounted on the back, and you can just run
[3761.84 → 3767.92] cooling tubes to it, and then you could have like way more PCIE slots on the other side like an
[3767.92 → 3773.04] ultimate expansion type build i think something like that would be really cool but i feel like sales
[3773.04 → 3776.88] on that would be really limited yeah it really would be i feel like we've sort of reached a point
[3776.88 → 3782.80] where it's pretty good for pretty much everything people need to do yeah like there's some neat ideas
[3782.80 → 3786.80] but i don't think they would be commercially viable and that is actually pretty important you need it
[3786.80 → 3794.24] to be commercially viable yeah yeah oh one more thing for the store if you guys are interested in the um
[3795.28 → 3802.48] the privateer shirt we are turning off sales i believe today or tomorrow like soon imminently
[3802.48 → 3806.80] so if you want to pick up a privateer shirt now is absolutely the time to get it
[3808.64 → 3814.64] uh mark t says would you please cover the part where you guys dual boot Windows 11 and on steam deck
[3814.64 → 3820.24] and also productivity on steam OS well productivity on steam OS is actually going to be quite excellent
[3820.24 → 3827.44] uh it should be very similar to what i was running with uh Manjaro and KDE plasma uh so it's arch based
[3827.44 → 3832.32] which Manjaro is also arch based, but they are not to be confused with each other, but you'll be
[3832.32 → 3838.40] able to use the arch user repository you'll be able to use flat pack so you can install pretty much
[3838.40 → 3844.40] most apps that you would need for productivity and then uh the desktop experience KDE plasma it's like
[3844.40 → 3849.92] very intuitive i mean what even do you do with your desktop environment these days anymore like almost
[3849.92 → 3855.84] everything i do is in a browser other than games so it just makes very little difference to me personally
[3855.84 → 3860.96] yeah yeah i mean okay there were some annoyances that i found like file copying issues and stuff like
[3860.96 → 3870.56] that right but uh hi Nick what can I do for you nick decided to visit i was just going to ask if you
[3870.56 → 3875.20] talked about the privateer shirt going away we did I just did I covered probably while you were walking
[3876.32 → 3882.08] uh twitter thing twitter which twitter thing the design there's a design on Twitter yeah oh you can download
[3882.08 → 3892.72] it oh that's right yes in true privateer spirit we've actually made the hold on download a car
[3893.52 → 3903.04] yeah yeah would you download a t-shirt uh so we have made the uh the full artwork like full
[3903.04 → 3910.32] quality artwork available on Google Drive so if you want to uh if you buccaneer out there miss out on this
[3910.32 → 3917.28] shirt you can plunder your own with this design file it's not a NFT what
[3920.88 → 3925.52] that's cool i like that so if you want to do a privateer poster or whatever the heck it is that
[3925.52 → 3930.96] you want to do you can absolutely uh use the artwork and do whatever you want with it consider this
[3930.96 → 3938.80] consider this my express permission to reproduce it for personal use as many times and as often as you
[3938.80 → 3942.08] want to if you use it commercially we will come after you all right cool
[3944.80 → 3952.80] all right you too uh what else we what else we got here you wouldn't download a shirt uh Charles l hey
[3952.80 → 3960.72] i was wondering if you still planned on reviewing the sofa baton v2 and why uh to remotes mentioned in
[3960.72 → 3965.76] the Black Friday stream as Logitech army replacements i do want to check them out i think we did order them
[3965.76 → 3972.40] but i have not gotten around to I've not gotten around to looking at them yet i will once we get
[3972.40 → 3977.12] moved into the new place though and i need a universal remote solution though in all likelihood
[3979.12 → 3983.44] so when a full plane chat added me and said make a NFT platform that allows theft
[3983.44 → 3987.12] it's like i think that's like photo bucket yeah every NFT platform
[3987.12 → 3997.76] yeah yeah yeah uh Marquez hey guys been watching since 2015 I'm a field tech at our local school
[3997.76 → 4003.12] system i work on multiple projectors and OEM business pcs with tight spaces will the Ltd screwdriver
[4003.12 → 4009.76] have a flexible driver set for tight spaces not this one well a lot of a lot of um a lot of them
[4009.76 → 4015.52] are adapter based right yes, so nothing would prevent you from plugging one of those into it, but it will
[4015.52 → 4021.28] not include it yeah it's just it's a screwdriver yeah i just couldn't get a different get a different
[4021.28 → 4027.36] one just a super solid screwdriver uh Jacob w hey Luke is there any keyboard that you could
[4027.36 → 4035.92] recommend as a replacement for my trusty IBM model m that's tough because if you like the IBM model m there's
[4035.92 → 4045.60] like it's pretty unique um also the keyboard space is extremely diverse yeah that's a good way of
[4045.60 → 4052.48] saying it there 's's so much stuff these days like it is used to be pretty simple you know there
[4052.48 → 4059.28] really wasn't all that many options um and now there's an incredible amount of options which is great
[4059.28 → 4064.00] uh but i can't recommend you one thing there's way too many preferences ahead i mean if you just want
[4064.00 → 4069.92] that again then unicomp is kind of the way to go oh well yeah but if you want to expand your horizons
[4069.92 → 4075.04] a little bit which i would recommend you can order sampler that's like sampler switch things that you
[4075.04 → 4079.60] can kind of try out all the different ones and see what shines and sparkles for you yeah it won't
[4079.60 → 4084.56] be a perfect representative experience, but it'll help a bit i don't think he wants like the same
[4084.56 → 4090.00] thing because he said my trusty model m which I'm assuming means it still works fair enough but I'm not
[4090.00 → 4096.80] i don't know uh did you do have you tested the steam deck much in docked slash desktop mode i didn't
[4096.80 → 4103.28] and the reason for that was that like i said that's the month with only a couple of days right to you
[4103.28 → 4107.52] know once I've kind of gone okay uh hopefully this is all the updates I'm going to get now let's start
[4107.52 → 4114.24] evaluating the experience in detail i couldn't possibly hope to look at it from every possible
[4114.24 → 4119.20] perspective so i just decided you know what I'm going to leave that out and i will cover it later yeah
[4122.00 → 4126.64] uh mark c says just don't get cherry MX browns do you think
[4129.60 → 4132.72] why are you going to be like that because they suck dude why are you going to be like they're bad
[4132.72 → 4138.24] they suck, and they're bad it's the only part of the keyboard space that is not uh you know
[4138.24 → 4144.24] it's not objected it is objective the rest of it is subjective you're so full of crap
[4144.24 → 4145.52] just suck you're so full of crap
[4151.84 → 4152.64] what a dick
[4154.56 → 4157.84] I'm kidding whatever do whatever you want but yeah you should go in the road
[4157.84 → 4161.44] that Linus mentioned or if you have a local computer store that has a tester at it so you
[4161.44 → 4168.40] don't have to buy your own it's a great idea what a troll mark z says do you think the mass
[4168.40 → 4173.04] adoption of the steam deck and the acceptance of it as a baseline for pc performance might help pc
[4173.04 → 4176.48] optimization get better especially on systems with integrated graphics absolutely
[4178.24 → 4186.32] someone in float lane chats like I've lost all respect for you come on meal l says i have the
[4186.32 → 4190.80] expensive edition the thread ripper and now the am4 CPU pillow, but you know what's missing
[4190.80 → 4197.20] a GPU body pillow it would be so expensive even if it wasn't stuffed with alpaca wool it would cost
[4197.20 → 4204.24] a freaking fortune what if you sold like the sleeve oh and then people could just fill it
[4204.24 → 4210.16] themselves you know we have a project kind of like that coming i can guess what that is not ready to
[4210.16 → 4215.36] talk about it yet though it's still early enough stages that if someone saw how we're planning to do
[4215.36 → 4219.76] it they could be like oh that's a perfect idea and probably beat us to market because we're
[4219.76 → 4224.40] going kind of slow because we have a lot of stuff that we're slowly pushing forward right now but
[4224.40 → 4230.16] I'm very excited about if it's kind of like a provided your own filling product of a certain sort
[4231.92 → 4237.84] GPU body pillow would be pretty sick though camel Pete says I've been I've been meaning to get these
[4237.84 → 4243.68] water bottles forever glad i could finally pull the trigger hey heck yeah oh that was pushed to stream
[4243.68 → 4248.24] already uh jack c hey Linus and Luke I've been a fan since the beginning of the pandemic what kind of
[4248.24 → 4256.24] music if any do you guys like to listen to oh boy ready for an eclectic playlist this is my current
[4256.24 → 4262.88] playlist we've got wish you were here by Avril Lavigne surface pressure from encanto who i am Jessica
[4262.88 → 4271.28] Andrews used to Daughtry around the world by a touch of class uh battlefield Jordan sparks this is
[4271.28 → 4280.08] actually my current playlist uh cabala Shere Prozac the wire him um beautiful life from the motion
[4280.08 → 4285.84] picture abominable soundtrack couldn't be better Kelly Clarkson all out of love air supply
[4285.84 → 4296.96] um yeah i don't think it gets much more random than that yeah i don't I don't know my uh my YouTube
[4296.96 → 4307.60] music is a wreck because um to calm the birds down i play music right so like I've found like uh my one
[4307.60 → 4314.80] bird really likes baba yet the intro song to civilization 4 yeah um the other bird really likes
[4314.80 → 4323.12] like week anime music got it they do not have both like either of those fantastic if i play one of them
[4323.12 → 4329.04] the one will get super hyped you don't want to sit there bored they both really like sea shanties
[4330.32 → 4336.56] oh that's very unfortunate so my most played thing is like assassin's creed 4 black flag sea shanties
[4337.20 → 4343.12] and there are certain songs on there that drive me absolutely nuts at this point i hate it
[4343.12 → 4350.40] it drives me crazy so yeah my uh my recommendations are all weird because like almost all of its
[4350.40 → 4356.32] various sea shanties that's extremely unfortunate I'm so sorry to hear that it's a little rough yeah
[4356.32 → 4362.32] yeah I've had people questioning why there's no rock um i don't know if Bryan Adams counts as rock but
[4362.32 → 4368.72] there's a lot of that in there later on love Bryan Adams one of the one of the few artists I've been to see
[4368.72 → 4379.52] live twice so good just so good one of our Canadian boys um uh last topic we do this one
[4380.48 → 4387.04] yeah sure oh no this is the last one okay cool yeah last topic oh someone asked if we have any more uh
[4387.04 → 4391.12] board books in the works and that was apparently pushed to stream we're always working on new things
[4391.12 → 4396.16] okay i can give you a more detailed answer on that one i am supposed to be technically there is a
[4396.16 → 4407.60] spreadsheet for it um i can show you the progress I've made so far if you'd like uh book let's try book
[4408.48 → 4417.84] kid book ideas and themes here we go so uh hopefully I'm not showing anything too oh well here's kind
[4417.84 → 4424.32] of a fun behind the scenes this was uh different themes that we discussed for the first
[4424.32 → 4431.84] abc book electronics so you know alternating current binary circuit board d-ram earth ground or electricity
[4432.72 → 4443.04] it ASIC bios uh cash i thought that was kind of cool mobile general technology more developer oriented so
[4443.04 → 4449.76] there were a lot of different uh kind of themes that we discussed retro gaming we were worried about
[4449.76 → 4453.84] for example here worried about trademark infringement and stuff like that we wanted something that we
[4453.84 → 4459.44] could keep really uh generic so here are a bunch of different things that didn't make it into the gaming
[4459.44 → 4469.36] one an is for antialiasing or AFK b is for bump map um c is for chroma subsampling d is for direct x so
[4469.36 → 4475.36] that was a trademark potential issue or d pad i think d pad is what we ended up with e is for eye
[4475.36 → 4482.88] tracking experience points uh easter egg would have been a fun one uh so yeah so here's kind
[4482.88 → 4490.32] of ours for ray tracing RGB render lots of different lots of different ideas that we had here's what's
[4490.32 → 4496.72] supposed to be the next one counting computers uh, so this is as far as I've gotten clearly not as much
[4496.72 → 4503.92] progress as i made on the abc book something about how there's a typo how computers are all around us
[4503.92 → 4508.72] and anything that computes is a computer than all the pages are counting different computers yep that's
[4508.72 → 4516.24] uh that's it that's my progress so far for counting computers someday i will actually write it
[4516.24 → 4521.44] the stupid thing is it doesn't even take me that long to write this kind of stuff like little rhyming
[4521.44 → 4527.36] couplets have always come pretty easily for me but i just uh i just haven't had time it's just
[4527.36 → 4538.16] been so many other things to do it's tough it's tough LSU asks uh oh shoot no that's embargoed uh LSU
[4538.16 → 4544.88] i cannot answer your question Linus the only author to write books in Excel okay now hold on a second
[4544.88 → 4554.64] i hold on a second did I actually i don't think i actually wrote it here in it uh not, and it's not excel it's Google sheets oh wait i did
[4555.84 → 4559.76] yep i did actually write the book in a spreadsheet
[4561.28 → 4568.08] uh, so these were the final these were the top three candidates for every letter
[4568.08 → 4576.08] and actually there are some there's some draft copy in here uh you can see that I'm just like working on
[4576.08 → 4587.20] rhymes run sun ton one bun done fun uh the sky bar the sky box darkens Foley fades i obviously didn't
[4587.20 → 4594.08] come up with something for that uh hit the hay recharge for another day tomorrow's your greatest adventure
[4594.08 → 4598.64] yet okay little gamer story's done get some sleep my little one oh yeah that was not a bad one but
[4598.64 → 4601.36] then i decided to do a two-line one for the last one
[4604.32 → 4609.68] if you need help to beat the boss use this avoids another loss that was alternate copy for w is for
[4609.68 → 4617.04] walkthrough actually a lot of them probably have uh yeah, and it's for NPCs rewards for armour
[4617.68 → 4622.32] some say they're lazy i don't mind the lazy stuff will give you stuff oh yeah you can tell why that didn't
[4622.32 → 4628.32] make it uh thanks I'm a flanker oh man
[4631.20 → 4636.96] yeah yeah it's really fun to work on this kind of stuff for me views for buttons now that the machine
[4636.96 → 4643.28] is fed can you touch the one that's red i settled on pushing these is fun to do can you touch the one
[4643.28 → 4648.24] that's blue i got Nick's feedback for a lot of this just like hey which one do you think is the best
[4648.24 → 4658.64] stuff like that gradient lol asks are you a Kanye fan i don't know i just haven't really i haven't
[4658.64 → 4665.04] really just in the news right now oh is he yeah oh what now i don't know all the details' oh man
[4666.80 → 4673.84] wanting to go to Russia or something but i don't know if it's even real okay um sure
[4673.84 → 4685.44] that's in other news uh Sony's PlayStation vr2 uh very, very interesting OLED displays running at uh
[4685.44 → 4693.68] 2000 by 2040 per eye at 90 hertz and 100 hertz refresh rates uh funky round dual controllers with
[4693.68 → 4702.24] haptic feedback and adaptive triggers capacitive sensors and six axis motion sensing 110 degree field of view
[4702.24 → 4708.88] eye traffic uh eye tracking um yeah things are good inside LUT single USB connection it's not like
[4708.88 → 4715.92] going to be the most amazing thing ever but I'm happy that uh we're seeing a PlayStation vr2 like
[4715.92 → 4722.32] yeah that's very cool to me yeah that confirms like VR is not going anywhere in the console space and
[4722.32 → 4728.64] Microsoft needs to either figure it out or i guess windows is their play there or whatever um it's also
[4728.64 → 4734.40] good that there's just still other players in the space absolutely you know yeah someone other than
[4734.40 → 4744.08] just Facebook yea holed display man yeah that's good that's real good like oh man I'd be I'd be
[4744.08 → 4749.20] tempted to see if there's a way to like hacksaw it to work on pc or something at that point that'd be
[4749.20 → 4754.24] freaking awesome that's the one thing about the index i mean other than being stuck with the tether
[4754.24 → 4762.88] that i would absolutely just pay index money for again OLED display upgrade for sure yeah for sure
[4764.08 → 4771.76] and then the last thing was if a monkey can't sue either can you how 9000 us denies copyright
[4771.76 → 4778.64] protection to AI produced works last week the US copyright office rejected a request to let an AI
[4778.64 → 4785.44] copyright or work of art after review the board at the USCG determined that art is made primarily
[4785.44 → 4790.80] or art that is made primarily by AI is not copyrightable due to a lack of human authorship
[4790.80 → 4799.44] this is going to get muddy oh yeah because primarily by AI is vague um so we're going to have to see what
[4799.44 → 4808.24] precedent says primarily by AI is do we seriously have a Kanye emote on float plane uh no i think people are
[4808.24 → 4816.72] inserting that got it anyway sorry carry on once one person does it, it's very easy to copy got it
[4816.72 → 4825.68] yeah but yeah we definitely do not um yeah i don't know it's its it's fascinating copyright law
[4825.68 → 4830.64] doesn't have any direct rules for non-humans past rulings have shown that courts aren't a fan of
[4830.64 → 4838.48] protecting works created by animals or divine beings um it's generally having to be made by a human
[4838.48 → 4846.08] there has already been questions raised like what if i made the AI does that not mean yeah that what
[4846.08 → 4856.24] the AI makes is mine well seemingly no got it, but we're not really sure again primarily by an AI is too
[4856.24 → 4864.00] vague um so we'll have to see just how this goes yeah there are a lot of discussion questions here like
[4864.00 → 4868.32] tom Scott used an algorithm to create concepts and titles for YouTube videos would LTT ever do this
[4868.88 → 4877.92] it says in here that easier yeah um the tech that he used to do that is not available to other people
[4877.92 → 4883.84] right now and i believe he does not have it anymore no, no it was just temporary access very interesting
[4883.84 → 4886.40] basically everything he does is very interesting, but that was a very cool video
[4888.88 → 4896.40] and that's that's kind of it i think i made it out of here unscathed nice no controversy and there's
[4896.40 → 4901.60] just one more merch message Michael k asks specifically what are you most excited about with the labs project
[4901.60 → 4911.28] PS my son loves your book i am most excited about what am I most excited about I'm most excited about
[4911.28 → 4918.72] working with the team that we're building there we've got some really, really promising hires like
[4919.68 → 4922.72] by the way probably next week we need to sit down and talk about the
[4925.04 → 4931.84] MVP for the yeah thing yeah and nonstop because that will drive hiring decisions yeah
[4933.04 → 4938.32] can we just stop hiring for just a little bit i mean that's your that's your call dude ah it's not though
[4938.32 → 4948.32] people are like i need more resources and I'm like so i don't know man yeah it's rough yeah my team
[4948.32 → 4955.92] size is going to kind of balloon i know interesting my brain hurts yeah okay all right uh for those of
[4955.92 → 4960.80] you who sent super chats my sincere apologies i cannot see them they're supposed to be here under
[4960.80 → 4965.12] viewer activity that's why you should send merch messages oh by the way we figured out why merch
[4965.12 → 4970.88] messages don't show up for some people Luke uh what was the technical explanation for that uh shop pay
[4972.64 → 4977.52] don't use shop pay if you have is you're signed in to shop pay there's a button it looks like it's
[4977.52 → 4986.24] like a hypertext link um that says check out his guest do that j elbows the dude i upgraded to a paid
[4986.24 → 4992.08] uh g suite account ages ago because we ran out of free seats for Linus media group like many years ago
[4995.12 → 5001.76] and i think that's the end of the show oh dang it one more merch message Sheldon any chance on
[5001.76 → 5009.28] bundling shirts a pick and choose option of like three or more i love getting my news from leg honestly
[5009.28 → 5015.44] probably not i mean we already go pretty aggressive on shirt prices they are printed here in
[5015.44 → 5022.24] Canada so that makes the cost higher than if we had it done overseas and compared to a lot of
[5022.24 → 5028.88] other merch i think our pricing is really aggressive at 19.99 us, and you can get mystery ones for as
[5028.88 → 5034.72] little as i think 14 so if you're is you're less concerned about the exact designs you can get like
[5034.72 → 5038.24] a few mystery shirts, and you should get three different things and if you're more concerned
[5038.24 → 5042.00] about the designs i think we're i think we're pretty fair about it especially given the quality of the
[5042.00 → 5060.64] shirts all right thanks for tuning in guys see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[5072.00 → 5088.40] oh we're still alive oh man i am so tired I'm not fully recovered from that all-nighter I'm just I'm
[5088.40 → 5098.40] not young like that anymore i can't do that anymore
[5098.88 → 5098.96] you
