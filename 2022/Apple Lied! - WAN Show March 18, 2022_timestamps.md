For the timestamp, you can add the following after the already existing link to manually add the timestamp: ?t=1h30m42s to go to 1:30:42 for example.

I find myself contributing to live chat 20 mins late most weeks, just to repeat my comments 
re: apple's power cord engineering effort 
This is almost certainly a decision driven by international market segmentation concerns... I assume there is more regulatory wiggle room for power (plug) standards relative to other options.
Re: float plane tech/sec profiles 
Maybe look at it as a smaller audience for investment in  talent development ( or community building pay it forward kind of thing... VC pool?)
Re:smartwatches
I still like the Fossil hybrid watches. I usually get 3-6 months on a coin cell for activity tracking depending on how agressive I have Bluetooth notifications and how much running I'm doing.
re: timestamps
I should have made the effort..

Can't wait to see what else will Apple "engineer" in the years to come. "Environmentally friendly" engineering FTW!
