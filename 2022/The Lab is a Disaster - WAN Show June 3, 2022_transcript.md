[0.00 --> 4.32]  reason right there that's fair enough but that doesn't put them to bed welcome to the
[4.32 --> 8.72]  wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today yeah
[8.72 --> 15.20]  but unfortunately luke can't stay for all of it because he has to go home and put his birds to bed
[16.40 --> 21.12]  that's right we're going to be talking home automation i do have an update on the jasko
[21.12 --> 28.08]  switch situation and hey if i'm getting rid of all of my switches i may have a recipient
[28.08 --> 34.56]  for my donation because luke has to go home to turn off a light so his bird will go to sleep an
[34.56 --> 39.04]  impressive amount of stuff at my house is literally your old things i'll also be updating you guys on
[39.04 --> 45.76]  the state of the lab we took possession on wednesday and i got a chance to go over there today
[46.96 --> 53.84]  and it's not good um what else we got today we have a question about roku devices we want to know why
[53.84 --> 60.00]  you use them um i would read from the doc for this question but it would be the length of a full video
[60.00 --> 65.92]  so we'll probably hopefully uh communicate with the audience as much as possible also canadians are up in
[65.92 --> 74.80]  arms because tim hortons has been tracking people canadians are also up in arms over uh bill c11 or
[74.80 --> 80.48]  whatever uh that's supposed to be in the doc today but i guess we won't be talking about that in detail
[80.48 --> 94.48]  let's go ahead and roll that intro
[94.48 --> 112.08]  show is brought to you guys by squarespace zoho desk and well front today let's jump right into
[112.08 --> 118.24]  our headline topic you haven't seen the lab at all yet i've seen the outside of the building that's it
[118.24 --> 127.68]  all right when i saw it okay it's about 20 000 square feet it's a big building it's right on the
[127.68 --> 132.88]  end of this street like i could almost hork from here to there uh it's got a lot of things going for
[132.88 --> 139.60]  it it has a ton of power yeah lots it's big enough that we can grow into it for quite some time like we
[139.60 --> 146.56]  could have a team of 30 40 people working out of there between developers engineers writing we could
[146.56 --> 153.36]  have a ton of creation going on over there um did i already mention it has a ton of power coming into
[153.36 --> 160.32]  it lots tons of power like large literally 300 000 watts of power it used to be like a machine shop
[160.32 --> 165.20]  or something yeah it used to be a sheet metal fabrication place yeah yeah so it has a lot going
[165.20 --> 169.76]  for it when i saw it it was all kind of humming you know there was a business running out of there and
[169.76 --> 180.08]  um everything seemed like kind of at least you know presentable well unfortunately between the
[180.08 --> 185.68]  things that they were supposed to do okay the things the seller was supposed to take care of
[185.68 --> 192.56]  like replacing ceiling tiles that had been stained by previous leaks or uh patching up holes
[192.56 --> 202.96]  um and the things that were just kind of concealed by the existing equipment right it is in a state that is
[204.24 --> 216.48]  literally six figures worse than i had anticipated oh yeah okay and then you know that you know that
[216.48 --> 222.24]  tone you know when my phone ringer went off right before the start of the show and i was like oh this is
[222.24 --> 228.24]  this is worse yeah okay so that is for i can't name this person yet they're still on their probation
[228.24 --> 238.16]  um but you know who they are one uh got it one of those hi gary and linus after doing a bunch of digging
[238.16 --> 248.80]  i found a used emc chamber that's fit for purpose the quote on it is 50 000 us dollars that's the deal one
[252.24 --> 260.56]  nice why don't we talk through some of the deficiencies at the new place okay okay first
[260.56 --> 267.52]  things first they they just outright ripped out um some of the some of the things that were supposed
[267.52 --> 274.24]  to stay for example there's a safety rail up on one of the balconies that okay so well they didn't just
[274.24 --> 279.36]  take it off okay if they had just taken it off that might have actually been better there were air
[279.36 --> 283.44]  compressors up there that we knew they were going to take with them that's equipment that you might
[283.44 --> 290.56]  want to take with you sure but instead of dragging them down the stairs the hard way they just took
[290.56 --> 299.52]  a sawzall or a roto zip or something cut off the safety rails so that they could get a forklift up
[299.52 --> 306.88]  there grabbed it and booked it and we're sitting here going so now you've basically taking it taken
[306.88 --> 315.52]  a building that was up to safety code you have unsafety codified it and just left this like 80
[315.52 --> 321.60]  pound hunk of steel or actually multiple ones just left them there hey you can bring that to a scrapyard
[321.60 --> 327.52]  hey thanks for that like five bucks and it's just like weird stuff they took with them okay i have
[327.52 --> 333.28]  never i've never seen i've never seen anything like it they took the paper towel dispensers off
[333.28 --> 338.08]  the bathroom walls they might need those in the new place well right but that's the kind of thing
[338.08 --> 343.12]  that's typically included in a base building yeah they left the toilet paper dispensers but not the
[343.12 --> 351.44]  paper towels oh no not the paper towel dispensers they took doorknobs now to be clear they were
[351.44 --> 360.08]  combination door locks doorknobs which i'm not electronic ones not fancy ones in any way i i
[360.08 --> 365.92]  could see them wanting to take those with them but you're supposed to replace them with something
[366.64 --> 373.52]  so as it is you just stick a screwdriver in the thing nice and i'm just i'm sitting here going this
[373.52 --> 381.12]  is this is ridiculous that's legit you should like weld in uh ltt screwdrivers to all the doors and just
[381.12 --> 390.16]  have that be the doorknobs no no no it would look cool no constant sponsorship every video
[392.48 --> 403.52]  basically can you go after them for this unfortunately there is no okay i don't know where you guys live
[403.52 --> 410.40]  but depending on the market that you're in um consumer protections or buyer protections in real
[410.40 --> 418.08]  estate have been significantly eroded yeah over well the last quite a few years to the point where
[418.08 --> 425.76]  you know when yvonne and i bought our bought our house our first home um it was normal for us to have
[425.76 --> 433.60]  like a multi-week due diligence period where we could go arrange our financing after making an offer
[434.24 --> 440.16]  get a proper thorough home inspection so that the so that the purchase agreement could have all the
[440.16 --> 447.36]  details for the things that need to be fixed before we move in um and there would be you know a reasonable
[447.36 --> 454.00]  in good faith negotiation process over these potential issues for example the house that that we lived in for
[454.00 --> 461.28]  10 years um the previous owners uh our our home inspector noted that the water tank was like on
[461.28 --> 467.12]  its last legs it was gonna go and so the previous owners in order to get the deal done split the cost
[467.12 --> 472.40]  of that that water tank with us so that when we were buying the home it would be in a reasonable ready to
[472.40 --> 480.00]  move into state well that's gone like in the lower mainland there i mean they are trying they are now
[480.00 --> 486.64]  talking about legislation that is going to eliminate blind bidding for example they are talking about
[486.64 --> 494.32]  legislation to have a mandatory cool down period so after an offer you have a mandatory period of time
[494.32 --> 498.48]  where you're allowed to go through that due diligence it's not long enough what i've seen proposed not
[498.48 --> 505.36]  nearly long enough but they're starting to do something but it doesn't exist right now so
[505.36 --> 512.80]  commercial real estate here is not quite as bad it's not it has not gotten quite as bad as residential
[512.80 --> 518.00]  but it's getting there it's getting really rough and we are at a point now where we did we did do an
[518.00 --> 526.24]  inspection so the base building envelope is at least sound you know but those little details are things
[526.24 --> 534.96]  that you have essentially no no leverage on and what we know is that after we made our offer another offer
[534.96 --> 540.56]  came in higher after our offer had been accepted so we knew that if we came in and we pushed back
[540.56 --> 547.68]  and we said hey we want you guys to fix up this and and do that and ensure x and y and z
[548.24 --> 553.76]  just go with the other they could have basically just kind of said no and our options would have been
[554.48 --> 563.36]  accept no for an answer or let the offer lapse and they just take a different offer so if we wanted to close the deal
[563.36 --> 568.08]  which like i said there are a lot of benefits to it in terms of location in terms of size
[568.80 --> 575.68]  it's not a very nice building which is actually our advantage it's not well set up for for it's large
[575.68 --> 580.96]  enough that you should be running you know significant amounts of of shipping in and out of it like it's
[580.96 --> 588.40]  20 000 square feet um but it's really not set up very well for truck access so it's like kind of a crappy
[588.40 --> 594.08]  building but because all we need is a ton of power a ton of space and backpack storage
[595.28 --> 602.00]  and backpack storage sorry um potentially um is perfect for us right so it a lot of stars aligned
[603.52 --> 606.96]  so what choice did we have really yeah
[609.12 --> 615.28]  yikes yeah um i mean i could go on we filmed a video while we were over there james yvonne and i
[615.28 --> 619.52]  james was the only one who knew exactly where we were planning to put people there's just man
[619.52 --> 624.56]  there's a lot of stuff that i just feel like a combination of i wish i'd looked a little closer
[624.56 --> 628.96]  not that it would have made a difference we would have done it anyway there's no other building it's
[628.96 --> 635.20]  kind of like it's kind of like buying a new car and then getting it home and realizing like your
[635.20 --> 640.08]  favorite your favorite coffee mug doesn't fit in the cup holder that well here or whatever yeah yeah
[640.08 --> 644.72]  just little things like that or holy crap it doesn't support android auto it only supports
[644.72 --> 649.76]  carplay and i'm an android kind of character i like i i didn't realize it takes premium gas i don't want
[649.76 --> 654.08]  to pay for that yeah yeah see then nothing that's a deal breaker you probably would have bought the
[654.08 --> 662.00]  same car anyway but like oh instead of instead of walking around it and being like oh shiny excite
[664.08 --> 667.12]  i'm a little frustrated i'm a little disappointed and i wish that
[667.12 --> 671.60]  i wish i had been a little more prepared it should just and like like you're talking about
[671.60 --> 675.36]  like the laws here should probably just be better but like you shouldn't be able to go into a building
[675.36 --> 682.00]  that you're handing off and just chop stuff up like like the railings like the door handles
[682.96 --> 688.32]  no that's pretty crappy the door handles should be there there should be some form of door handles
[688.32 --> 692.00]  like you said though they could take the like smart ones whatever and then put in like fairly
[692.00 --> 696.88]  standard door handles yeah as long as they're door handles that function yes whatever but like
[697.44 --> 702.64]  so that should be done you shouldn't be able to completely remove functionality of a door yeah and
[703.36 --> 708.24]  and then also you shouldn't just like chop up safety railings like that's both of those things are
[708.24 --> 714.24]  crazy yeah like neither neither these are like somewhat reasonable the thing to understand too is that
[714.24 --> 721.52]  there's three parties involved there's the buyer the seller and the tenant so it was the tenant going and
[721.52 --> 729.28]  they don't care it's not their deal they don't oh the odds of the seller even if we do come back to
[729.28 --> 735.52]  the seller and be like um actually no this does need to be fixed the odds of them going and chasing
[735.52 --> 742.00]  this prior tenant and retrieving it basically minimal so they went in there and went as long as
[742.00 --> 748.00]  we don't do like a hundred grand worth of damage to this place it's unlikely to be worth the cost of
[748.00 --> 755.92]  pursuing this legally so we can just go for it yikes let's talk about the good things yikes the labs team
[755.92 --> 762.24]  is up to i believe six people now yeah they're working out of the old creator warehouse space um
[762.24 --> 769.44]  gary got deported it's complicated but he'll be back um so he's working out of where he used to live
[769.44 --> 776.08]  for for now yeah i keep here i keep thinking that he's here and then hearing that he's not and i'm
[776.08 --> 784.88]  like yeah oh it's complicated okay um oh okay uh all right some other good things about the lab the
[784.88 --> 790.24]  line of sight between the existing office and the lab looks good so we should be able to set up wi-fi
[790.24 --> 795.76]  dishes that's going to be pretty cool um what else is good there's already been some really good work done
[795.76 --> 803.44]  yep i mean uh this is apparently a deal so i'm apparently getting a deal on uh on an anechoic
[804.08 --> 811.04]  chamber so that's good how big is it i mean it looks it looks pretty sick is that like walking
[811.04 --> 817.76]  it's three meters so like that looks pretty cool that's not small that makes sense that it's that
[817.76 --> 826.32]  expensive i thought this was like okay yeah yeah yeah i mean so that's things that big are gonna
[826.80 --> 835.68]  yeah they're gonna cost some moola is it like on springs or anything um i guess you could just mount
[835.68 --> 843.12]  it however you wanted i'm adding yvonne to this yeah we gotta we gotta it's fostered it's we gotta do
[843.12 --> 849.84]  stuff um we'll make it oh man there's uh oh oh man i found out my office is smaller than i thought
[849.84 --> 858.40]  oh no my office is gonna get smaller oh daddy didus okay come on more office with the two windows but
[858.40 --> 864.96]  it's too small you know i don't have to give you one you're not
[864.96 --> 872.80]  i thought we did not really i thought we established this a call room yeah but it's
[872.80 --> 877.36]  yours whenever you want it do you want to show up to my call room no you can come to my office
[877.36 --> 882.16]  it's actually not really big enough to like meet with multiple people and also have my oh that's
[882.16 --> 887.36]  not great yeah yeah like it's wait how small is it then compare can you compare it to like this room
[887.36 --> 895.28]  uh it's maybe to like that kind of almost vertical two by six no it's not that big actually maybe more
[895.28 --> 901.20]  like to that light and then like to here yeah you can fit people in there well i mean i need my desk
[901.20 --> 906.56]  in there too yeah and stuff and like i'd like to have a test bench and stuff oh so like you want to
[906.56 --> 911.20]  transplant the same setup yeah like is it smaller than that one yeah it's smaller than my existing so i
[911.20 --> 916.32]  went from i went from i had the biggest office in this building to yvonne took it and then i went into
[916.32 --> 920.72]  your old office yvonne shares hers with like two other people one other person two you're right
[920.72 --> 925.84]  you're right you're right so i had i had like i had like the king office and then i went to the one
[925.84 --> 932.16]  that we built for you and then you got none and then now i'm actually downgrading again and um i guess
[932.16 --> 938.24]  what we could probably infer from the fact that i'm getting a smaller one and your new one is smaller
[938.24 --> 945.52]  than my new one is that yours will be a significant downgrade from your old one yeah um i don't need a
[945.52 --> 950.80]  big office though yeah i would meet with probably a maximum of one person at a time or it would just
[950.80 --> 955.60]  make more sense to go to a conference room okay that's another thing the place we had planned to
[955.60 --> 961.20]  put the server room the walls don't go all the way up noise isolation for it is going to be a
[961.20 --> 968.72]  significant challenge everything can be overcome not good everything can be overcome it's just you raise
[968.72 --> 976.48]  the walls money yeah yeah time no changing out the walls gonna be a challenge because you can't just
[976.48 --> 982.32]  like because of the parking being maxed out we can't make any actual structural changes to the building
[983.52 --> 990.24]  so i don't know maybe we just huck a bunch of like structural rock wool up there yeah okay yeah like you
[990.24 --> 997.52]  can't change the floor plan essentially oh so it's not a room no it's like it's like a half wall up to
[997.52 --> 1004.96]  a t-bar drop ceiling got it yeah it's not it's not a real wall yeah uh we did find a place for a fire
[1004.96 --> 1011.60]  pole so that's good you're actually doing it no okay definitely not yeah i'm excited to move in i guess
[1011.60 --> 1017.36]  that's part of why i'm so disappointed because i was really excited to move in and today reality hit me
[1017.36 --> 1026.16]  like a sledgehammer to the face that i am not moving in anytime soon i and nobody else are moving
[1026.16 --> 1032.16]  in in at least like a couple months okay yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be rough sounds like i'm working
[1032.16 --> 1037.84]  from home for a bit more boys or a bit more yep i hope you've got air conditioning at your house i do
[1037.84 --> 1046.24]  actually good excellent yeah that worked out that fixed yeah okay it's okay it's okay fine what do you
[1046.24 --> 1051.04]  want to talk about next why don't you pick a topic because i just i can't right now i'm sorry update on
[1051.04 --> 1056.16]  the jazzco situation will this make you happy no okay i thought it was good i thought it was good we
[1056.16 --> 1062.24]  can go to something else uh tim hortons is tracking your bits no that's not good news either luke uh
[1062.24 --> 1068.96]  let's talk jazzco last week i talked about the situation where jazzco the manufacturer of the motion
[1068.96 --> 1075.28]  sensing smart switches that i installed in my new house refused to provide updated firmware for the
[1075.28 --> 1083.04]  switches after jake and i experienced um buggy behavior we have since done a lot of troubleshooting
[1083.04 --> 1089.36]  we've gone back and forth with jazzco and there are a few noteworthy outcomes here outcome number one
[1089.36 --> 1096.80]  is that jazzco has publicly stated that they will engage with the community in a in good faith on the
[1096.80 --> 1102.88]  issue of firmware availability whether this ends up looking like you request it from them and they provide
[1102.88 --> 1109.36]  it or a download page on their website that's yet to be seen but they've had high level discussions
[1109.36 --> 1113.44]  internally and it looks like that's something that's going to change very good so that is
[1113.44 --> 1121.12]  excellent awesome great bad news oh more good news first more good news i don't know what was going on
[1121.12 --> 1124.64]  well we have an idea what's going on we'll give you more details on that in a moment but
[1124.64 --> 1132.88]  um i did manage to disable the motion sensor so i went and i bet i tried again and remember that
[1132.88 --> 1136.96]  issue i had where i thought maybe a firmware update would fix not being able to disable the motion sensor
[1136.96 --> 1142.08]  on it well i tried it and i worked was able to disable the motion nice gotta love when troubleshooting
[1142.08 --> 1149.04]  happens yeah so maybe i don't need new firmware also you should have access to new firmware anyway
[1149.04 --> 1158.32]  jasco mixed up their hexadecimal and their binary and the firmware sorry hexadecimal and
[1158.32 --> 1162.16]  hold on hold on let me double check i mean that could be a thing but i don't know what you're talking about
[1163.28 --> 1170.00]  okay uh let's uh they actually like talk to you about this in an email uh yeah yep yep yep yep
[1170.00 --> 1176.88]  yep okay that's a lot of emails uh so they they mixed up their so when certifying the firmware with
[1176.88 --> 1183.36]  the z-wave alliance you must fill out the form using hexadecimal format this was entered in as 32
[1183.36 --> 1189.20]  and was incorrectly translated from hex oh sorry two decimal as 50. the correct version for that
[1189.20 --> 1199.36]  certification should be 32. so the so-called 5.50 firmware is the one that i was using they do not
[1199.36 --> 1206.48]  have updated firmware they did send me the files so i can try to reflash and see if that fixes any
[1206.48 --> 1211.12]  potential issue jake validated this already so you don't have to check and see if there's no checks
[1214.56 --> 1219.36]  but then i was able to disable the motion anyway but then i was able to replicate the issue where i
[1219.36 --> 1224.80]  was not able to disable the motion because i went to adopt yet another switch and it actually grabbed
[1224.80 --> 1232.48]  the same device number within the like the z-wave js thing in home assistant and then like neither of
[1232.48 --> 1238.48]  them would work properly until i uh i disconnected both of them and then adopt them both adopted them
[1238.48 --> 1244.56]  both again and then they would work so it could still there could still be buggy behavior we don't
[1244.56 --> 1251.92]  know whether that is on home assistant or or uh i think it's like a z-wave.js or something like that
[1251.92 --> 1256.32]  completely regardless you should still be able to access the firmware yes you should still have access to
[1256.32 --> 1261.12]  firmware i was still right to be mad about the fact that they would not give me firmware because i would have
[1261.12 --> 1266.00]  been far less mad if i just had bought a buggy product i still would have been mad i have also
[1266.00 --> 1273.12]  found bugs that have not been resolved for example the by the firmware by anything okay yeah by by
[1273.12 --> 1279.12]  anything so the timeout so you would think at least i believe that's what this parameter does disclaimer i
[1279.12 --> 1284.08]  don't know maybe it does something else entirely i don't know but i would think that on a motion sensor
[1284.08 --> 1292.08]  a timeout field would affect how long it is until the motion sensor kicks back in so if i if i were to
[1292.64 --> 1298.00]  turn it off if it were to turn off how long before it starts sensing again and as it is they're immediate
[1298.00 --> 1305.04]  out of the box so you can press the button to leave the bathroom and as you walk away it'll turn back on
[1305.04 --> 1309.84]  that's obviously not a desirable behavior so i think that's what that field's supposed to do okay changing
[1309.84 --> 1314.96]  that does not appear to affect anything there's also a vacancy mode vacancy mode's kind of cool
[1314.96 --> 1320.08]  so occupancy mode turns on the light when it senses motion and then turns off the light when it stops
[1320.08 --> 1327.36]  sensing motion right vacancy mode will only turn on the light when you turn it on and then it will turn
[1327.36 --> 1334.08]  it off when you leave vacancy mode does not appear to be functioning correctly but again i don't know
[1334.08 --> 1338.64]  whose fault that is so i'm not going to point any fingers yet sure what i do know is that there have
[1338.64 --> 1346.08]  been other developments seeing the problems that i was having with jazco i've had um one of the switch
[1346.08 --> 1352.88]  companies that a lot of people actually said that i should check out in the comments under last week's
[1352.88 --> 1361.68]  lan show one of them reached out uh in the valley i want to say in uh yeah yep yep in a valley reached out
[1361.68 --> 1368.16]  um aeotech reached out i think you mentioned in a valley in the on the show and there's
[1368.64 --> 1375.52]  yeah yeah so in a valley reached out uh aeotech reached out and actually there's another switch
[1375.52 --> 1385.92]  company that um that jake found that is so cool you should have a battle you should get like a sample
[1385.92 --> 1392.40]  set of switches from each one and have like a a uh battle royale realistically that's what we probably
[1392.40 --> 1399.36]  should have done but one lives we just like are very busy we're very busy people and it's like
[1399.36 --> 1405.60]  it's tough oh but it's a video it's content if you don't have time you don't have time
[1407.36 --> 1416.40]  okay check these out okay swidget apparently these guys are oh my stop enough apparently these guys are
[1416.40 --> 1424.08]  canadian these are modular modular smart home switches so they've got humidity sensors motion
[1424.08 --> 1431.52]  sensors oh that's cool like you can put a usb port in there they're kind of fugly um in my humble
[1431.52 --> 1437.12]  opinion sorry swidget i don't think they're that bad but in terms of functionality this looks flippin
[1437.76 --> 1444.16]  amazing so being able to just be like yeah hey couldn't help noticing that it's a little humid in here
[1444.16 --> 1448.24]  don't mind me gonna switch on your fan in the bathroom do you care about the aesthetics of the
[1448.24 --> 1454.80]  switch if it felt good if the haptics were good oh that overpowered the aesthetics that's far more
[1454.80 --> 1460.48]  important yeah i agree i mean that's the main reason that i didn't go with um caseta or whatever
[1460.48 --> 1469.52]  who's who's the parent brand uh for uh smart switches caseta is it lutron lutron yeah that's why i
[1469.52 --> 1475.44]  didn't go with those because they feel awful they're just abhorrent if i ever have to actually
[1475.44 --> 1482.64]  use them with my fingers it's it's like i just i feel guilty spending money on them like i just i
[1482.64 --> 1486.56]  can't believe i gave them money for you know what do you want to reward that like terrible haptics
[1486.56 --> 1494.56]  yeah it's so important way to way to cheap out in the most obvious user facing kind of way you
[1494.56 --> 1502.56]  idiots like just that kind of thing you know yeah it's tough for sure so jasco situation still
[1502.56 --> 1508.96]  developing the first video on it is going to be edited when jake's back from uh back from vacation
[1508.96 --> 1515.60]  so whenever that happens and we will hopefully get you guys completely up to speed you'll get to live
[1515.60 --> 1521.60]  through the frustration with us it's definitely worth a watch just because i i don't remember the last
[1521.60 --> 1527.60]  time my anger was that white hot man when i when i was always fun when i was on the phone and they
[1527.60 --> 1532.40]  were like sorry sir we do not provide firmware that's proprietary i'm like
[1536.08 --> 1543.60]  i will i do applaud their change of stance me too credit where it's due yeah okay yeah there is an
[1543.60 --> 1550.88]  enormous difference between having a you know an ass backwards way of thinking and doubling down on it
[1551.52 --> 1557.60]  and having an ass backwards way of thinking and someone honestly not that nicely yeah sure
[1558.48 --> 1565.04]  telling you that your way of thinking is ass backwards and still having the maturity to self-reflect
[1565.04 --> 1572.96]  and go i respect that a ton i think that's huge okay yeah it's time to change yeah and if they
[1572.96 --> 1578.72]  actually follow through fully because there's still some some follow-through right yes but if they
[1578.72 --> 1583.12]  actually follow through fully that's huge and very cool and i respect it but there's the public
[1583.12 --> 1589.28]  commitment they are publicly in touch with home assistant that's a big deal that's cool that's a
[1589.28 --> 1596.64]  huge deal for the diy community and the more and and you gotta understand like there is absolutely
[1596.64 --> 1603.20]  attention on this and seeing jasco reverse seeing jasco embrace this i guarantee you that'll put
[1603.20 --> 1607.84]  pressure on other players in the industry absolutely to take a more open approach and that's what we need
[1607.84 --> 1614.72]  because that's what's breaking smart home stuff that's what's killing the adoption is you've got all these
[1614.72 --> 1621.60]  horrible fragmented ecosystems and you know as a consumer right let's say i couldn't afford to
[1621.60 --> 1627.92]  replace all the switches in my house like the vast majority of people let's say i wanted to upgrade
[1627.92 --> 1635.28]  piecemeal how do i know which one is still going to exist for me to actually get another one in a year
[1635.28 --> 1641.44]  or two years or five years so knowing that these are open and they can all ultimately be tied together
[1641.44 --> 1646.00]  it's very cool it's critical yeah because otherwise why would you take that first step
[1646.00 --> 1651.36]  why would you get a smart switch so that you can turn your bird's stupid light on
[1652.00 --> 1659.84]  from a distance instead of driving all the way home to turn a light on or off to put your bird to bed
[1659.84 --> 1665.68]  what is wrong with you sorry those of you who missed it luke's excuse for not coming over to watch
[1665.68 --> 1670.72]  a movie with more complications than that for not coming over to watch a movie with me tonight
[1670.72 --> 1676.24]  is that he has to go home so he can turn off the light so he can put his bird to bed and then
[1676.24 --> 1684.16]  put them to bed please explain so okay so there's two things going on here one is that the birds have
[1684.16 --> 1689.44]  to go to bed eventually my girlfriend gets home and the second is you are a giant bird simp and the second
[1689.44 --> 1698.96]  yeah sure uh and the second is that they are they have extremely extremely bad dark vision
[1698.96 --> 1706.56]  they they become like effectively blind the second it's like dimly lit in the room um like one of the
[1706.56 --> 1713.04]  easiest ways to catch them is just have a few light sources that are generally far away and turn off all
[1713.04 --> 1716.96]  the close ones and then you just walk up to them and go like scoop because they can't see anything
[1716.96 --> 1724.96]  um so i don't i i have mentioned many times i don't have home automation stuff i forgot to turn
[1724.96 --> 1729.84]  the light on before i leave usually i remember so it's going to be actually it's summer now it probably
[1729.84 --> 1735.84]  doesn't matter actually they're birds and it probably never mattered but carry on so it would be really dark
[1735.84 --> 1742.08]  and they would be uncomfortable and it would be bad for them um and then it's their bedtime around like
[1742.08 --> 1751.20]  8 30 and sometimes the wans show can go real late that's fair real late that's fair what you said so
[1751.20 --> 1755.36]  i have to put them to bed i don't have to like it but i do have to respect it i don't think i'm going
[1755.36 --> 1762.32]  to be able to home automate putting them to bed i bet you could it's possible man you do a little light
[1762.32 --> 1766.88]  curtain thing for their thing it's possible that would actually be kind of a cool project it could be
[1766.88 --> 1772.56]  kind of neat we uh title title for the video bell can you note this down we solved the world's
[1772.56 --> 1780.00]  stupidest problem i mean i think that would be a great collab with simone gertz it'd be sweet yeah
[1780.00 --> 1785.84]  like just building a stupid machine for a thing that no one should have to do okay luke you know that
[1785.84 --> 1792.64]  not everyone babies their budgie the way that you do right sure and that your budgies but i do your
[1792.64 --> 1799.60]  budgies are playing you right sure okay i'm just making sure that i heard that bird dad
[1800.48 --> 1807.52]  i don't like this anti-bird stance line look i'm not i'm not anti birds aren't real no canada is not
[1807.52 --> 1813.84]  real or canada neither of them are real um as for canada geese well they're double not real they're
[1813.84 --> 1822.08]  birds and canadian um yeah i don't know i can make it work i can make it work it just probably i'd have to
[1822.08 --> 1832.24]  go home first that's all i gotta put them to bed dude okay why okay why why don't why don't we talk

[2064.08 --> 2071.12]  is an interactive topic ladies and gentlemen we had a lot of sorry i have one question you mentioned uh that
[2071.12 --> 2075.20]  you had a rant that's in a video that's coming up that's like the angriest you've been in a long
[2075.20 --> 2085.36]  time that's not really a question is it worse than eggshell uh i think i was uh so the thing about
[2085.36 --> 2090.64]  this is a question brought by the audience yeah the thing about the paint issue is that it had been
[2090.64 --> 2096.56]  like a slow burn right like i it had been one issue after another after another after another we're
[2096.56 --> 2101.04]  still not done with the issues with those painters by the way did i talk at all about how like they
[2101.04 --> 2106.80]  masking taped everything even though no professional painter in my opinion should be masking everything
[2106.80 --> 2110.64]  off with tape like that you should just know how to cut a straight line with a three inch brush
[2111.28 --> 2117.12]  because you're a professional anyway the point is like super hard masking tape who did i thought it was
[2117.12 --> 2122.88]  david called you out in some video because you did a line without masking but it was all messy yes it's
[2122.88 --> 2126.80]  it's good enough it's better than what happens with masking tape especially if you leave it on for
[2126.80 --> 2130.08]  too long i don't know because so they left the masking tape on too long and there's places where
[2130.08 --> 2135.20]  once they finally ripped it away because it's latex paint it's kind of rubbery it peels away a
[2135.20 --> 2139.76]  bunch of the freaking wall too so then you what you're gonna go back in with the sandpaper go cut the
[2139.76 --> 2146.32]  line anyway you might as well just cut it in the first place yeah basically um so it would have been
[2146.32 --> 2149.52]  a bit of a slow burn because it was like one issue after another after another after another
[2149.52 --> 2158.64]  whereas the shock the pure shock and awe of a company telling me that they have firmware so that
[2158.64 --> 2163.12]  that was a miscommunication obviously but the part that wasn't a miscommunication was that they do not
[2163.12 --> 2171.76]  provide them to clients that just it enraged me so this is another level yeah it's like it's like sudden
[2171.76 --> 2178.40]  onset road rage versus like you've had a really long week and you're tired and irritable right okay yeah
[2178.40 --> 2186.32]  yeah yeah yeah like that guy cut me off you know like just what exciting who does that who takes the
[2186.32 --> 2194.56]  paper towel dispensers out of the building and cuts off the safety rails are you did you film yeah nice
[2195.20 --> 2199.36]  yvonne was actually the one who noticed it i didn't even notice because i was just like yeah i'm chill
[2199.36 --> 2204.88]  whatever i spent like two summers of my life walking around on roofs i don't care about like an open
[2204.88 --> 2210.24]  drop but from from a like safety regulate regulatory standpoint right you do have to she was looking
[2210.24 --> 2218.24]  at it going um what money yeah yeah yep yep yep okay what are we supposed to be talking about here
[2218.96 --> 2220.80]  ah yes this is an interactive topic
[2223.20 --> 2229.44]  i posted just a little open letter to the float plane community earlier this week just being like hey
[2229.44 --> 2234.96]  hey really appreciate you guys i think it was the day that the money came out of our account for the
[2234.96 --> 2242.00]  lab and i was feeling a lot of anxiety because it's the most money that we've ever spent i don't know
[2242.00 --> 2247.44]  if i've disclosed the amount but it was 13 13 and a half million dollars by the time all the fees were
[2247.44 --> 2255.28]  accounted for big bucks canadian dollars i guess so like 10 us but that's i mean far and away the most
[2255.28 --> 2260.72]  money we've ever spent on everything to be clear no we don't have 10 million dollars in the bank um
[2260.72 --> 2267.12]  we financed it so it was uh it was 10 down but that's still a million dollars going out of the bank
[2267.12 --> 2273.44]  account um and so i was feeling really stressed out and i i was like you know needed a minute and so i
[2273.44 --> 2280.16]  sat and i just typed up a little thing like hey float plane appreciate you um because yeah it's not
[2280.16 --> 2287.20]  as it's not as big of a driver of overall revenue compared to certain other business units whether
[2287.20 --> 2293.44]  it's like creator warehouse or uh the business team again love you business team real don't leave me um
[2294.48 --> 2301.04]  but it's really consistent like that community has stood behind us um yeah there's almost 21 000
[2301.04 --> 2306.40]  they're almost 21 000 strong and you know those are those are real numbers at that point you know i can
[2306.40 --> 2311.44]  know that if my if my payments for for this building are going to be off actually yeah
[2311.44 --> 2317.52]  hundreds of thousands of dollars a year which they are that you know float plane is going to be there
[2317.52 --> 2322.56]  providing that that consistent income right like it's it's a big deal right and so i was just like
[2322.56 --> 2327.76]  hey float plane appreciate you um anyway that uh the comments under that ended up having a lot of
[2327.76 --> 2332.48]  really great feedback about what we could do to make the platform better to help attract more people to
[2332.48 --> 2339.52]  it and and keep growing it right because that's going to be it's going to get tougher as we go
[2339.52 --> 2344.64]  harder on manufacturers i think there are going to be significant sponsors that walk away from us
[2344.64 --> 2351.52]  and that's something that i've had to kind of steal myself for because we can't have it both ways right
[2351.52 --> 2357.28]  we can't have hey we're going to be brutally honest but also we're going to sweep things under the rug when
[2357.28 --> 2363.36]  it's convenient right so sponsors are going to have to just put on their big kid pants and deal with
[2363.36 --> 2369.36]  some of them do sometimes we're going to be critical of them and other times we're going to be engaging
[2369.36 --> 2375.12]  with them in a sponsored capacity and that's just the way it has to be if you want access to our audience
[2375.12 --> 2379.20]  who trusts us because we're going to give it to them straight then you're just going to have to take
[2379.20 --> 2384.88]  your lumps when they come right and um oh i forget where i was going with this
[2387.52 --> 2391.44]  right right right so so these great suggestions to help grow this community which we're going to
[2391.44 --> 2398.72]  become more reliant on uh one of the one of the ones i saw over and over again is you need a roku app
[2399.36 --> 2406.64]  and the first question that came to my mind various smart tv nvidia shield app apple tv app yeah but
[2406.64 --> 2414.08]  roku fire stick app is the one that i saw the most and roku's have existed since back when i was
[2414.08 --> 2422.16]  working at ncix best buy for me i didn't understand the reason that they existed then me neither and i
[2422.16 --> 2427.76]  don't understand the reason that they exist now me neither so i really want this to be a super
[2427.76 --> 2434.08]  interactive topic with you guys the community roku lovers i want to know i want to know why did people
[2434.08 --> 2440.08]  buy them from ncix a handful yeah because i used to work at best buy no one ever bought them from
[2440.08 --> 2446.08]  best buy well that's okay and when i say some people i mean like we would sell three a week yeah
[2446.08 --> 2452.24]  like like not a significant number so i just didn't get it like compared to something like the um do you
[2452.24 --> 2460.80]  remember popcorn time yeah yeah so compared to like popcorn time which was like a super super clean way
[2460.80 --> 2465.52]  of torrenting movies back in the day it's not crazy not only would you torrent the movies but there
[2465.52 --> 2472.00]  was a great interface for browsing them like very netflix-esque and then instead of waiting for the
[2472.00 --> 2478.56]  whole thing to download and then playing it popcorn time had figured out how to download the chunks in
[2478.56 --> 2485.20]  order and serve the video to you as it's streaming down so it essentially you would stream it really
[2485.20 --> 2492.16]  like netflix but then you would yeah but then you would have the full file at the end of streaming it
[2492.16 --> 2498.88]  like torrenting uh it was kind of mind-blowing obviously it was like illegal and i to my knowledge
[2498.88 --> 2504.56]  doesn't exist anymore maybe it does but then there was also the patriot box office whose main function
[2504.56 --> 2512.64]  was it was really easy to access in that particular case uh i think it was like korean soaps and um and
[2512.64 --> 2518.08]  like chinese shows and stuff like that so i mean we would sell hundreds a week of devices like that
[2519.20 --> 2527.68]  but you know roku especially back then when almost no one was paying for like web web video content uh
[2528.40 --> 2535.76]  i just i didn't really get it then and nowadays i mean there's your tv which probably has a lot of
[2535.76 --> 2544.80]  apps for it already there's the nvidia shield which i mean whatever whatever i might think of nvidia
[2544.80 --> 2551.44]  the shield is basically just an absolute no-brainer for me if you want a smart interface for a tv that
[2551.44 --> 2558.88]  either doesn't have one or has a poor one it's expensive yes i don't know how much roku costs at all
[2558.88 --> 2566.08]  they have high-end models have have we gotten any like really great feedback from people something
[2566.08 --> 2572.64]  that i saw that i'm looking into yeah um and it does totally seem like it's a thing is there's a
[2572.64 --> 2582.16]  a bunch of tvs that have roku integration by tcl has built-in roku not just that rca tcl on
[2582.16 --> 2592.00]  uh onn is uh walmart's house brand hisense um yeah and like they're available at costco which is
[2592.00 --> 2596.16]  probably where a lot of them come from walmart which is probably where a lot of something being
[2596.16 --> 2601.36]  available isn't a reason to buy one no but if there's a tv at costco a lot of people are probably
[2601.36 --> 2606.80]  going to assume that it's at least a decent offer like i bet you costco there's a lot of tvs oh i see
[2606.80 --> 2613.20]  you mean a lot of the ones a lot of the tvs at costco have on board roku i i think so there's
[2613.20 --> 2618.64]  multiple tvs at costco that have it got it because it looks like yeah there's three different high sense
[2618.64 --> 2627.04]  tvs at costco that have roku built in okay all right what else we got here um some other people
[2627.04 --> 2635.76]  saying that they prefer roku to their tvs already existing smart tv stuff kubla says i love mine because
[2635.76 --> 2640.64]  it's more reliably updated and performs better than the built-in tv apps i can also take it on vacation
[2640.64 --> 2646.88]  yeah that okay so that wraps in actually a lot of other feedback that i've seen okay hammy 3d says
[2646.88 --> 2652.00]  cracking a fire stick is the best way at the moment so that might be a good reason to to have one of
[2652.00 --> 2661.36]  those the remote is good says dextrous man x76 um ninja ninja man away over on floatplane chat says my isb
[2661.36 --> 2666.72]  gave me my isp gave me their streaming box for free but it's a rebranded roku okay that i didn't know
[2666.72 --> 2675.44]  that's interesting so basically way more people are using these than i realized i guess probably me as
[2675.44 --> 2687.12]  well okay so is this something but man like oh it's gonna be tough it's gonna be tough i i can't i can't
[2687.12 --> 2695.20]  promise guys yeah building a whole new platform just because i don't think it's yeah okay this is
[2695.20 --> 2699.68]  a good point joseph says my grandparents got a roku because they didn't know chromecast existed yeah like
[2699.68 --> 2708.40]  if you want a low cast op or a low cost option chromecast i like i still i don't know it's one of
[2708.40 --> 2718.40]  the okay it's one of those things that i look at and i go yes i see the value add i just don't see
[2718.40 --> 2725.04]  the value add compared to other options if i wanted a super premium option i would absolutely get a shield
[2725.04 --> 2732.48]  if i wanted a budget option i would go for a chromecast or i'm sure there are like low cost
[2732.48 --> 2742.88]  uh you know rando ones that you can also get yeah there is and like i've never personally used it
[2742.88 --> 2751.44]  but but this app has actually existed for a really long time now um which one just share screen hydravion
[2751.44 --> 2759.36]  you can sure and like again i haven't personally used it um oh seriously but this has existed for
[2760.16 --> 2764.40]  an extremely long time and everyone that i know that uses it says that it's good
[2764.40 --> 2769.76]  um and it like works with your different subscriptions like it shows there there's there's like it works
[2769.76 --> 2776.64]  with so if you're subscribed to ltt and in this example bitwit ultra or whatever else it should work
[2776.64 --> 2782.64]  with all of that you can browse your various channels like i i've heard very good things about this um
[2782.64 --> 2792.32]  um okay i should probably reach out to bml zoo town at some point yeah and maybe just get him to
[2792.32 --> 2797.60]  like make it officially for us or something yeah yeah i don't know i don't have any money right now but
[2797.60 --> 2804.00]  maybe someday we could pay for it i don't know all right yeah but but yeah like honestly the the
[2804.00 --> 2811.60]  uh a lot of the team is sick right now is what i will say without getting into specifics yeah that's
[2811.60 --> 2818.96]  fair um and the dev bandwidth that we have to be able to type of kind of spread around is very
[2818.96 --> 2825.28]  limited currently um i am hiring a speaking of having no money um i am hiring a back-end developer
[2825.28 --> 2832.24]  to try to come in and help support the flow plane team um and but but it's gonna like take some time
[2832.24 --> 2837.28]  for that person to get onboarded and there's there's other extremely important things on the roadmap that
[2837.28 --> 2844.80]  would have to get done ahead of time etc etc but yeah all right um i guess it's the point in the show
[2844.80 --> 2850.16]  where we take some merch messages bell do you want to hit me with some merch messages i would love to
[2851.04 --> 2856.08]  from reed what are your thoughts on the new varho making a vr headset with a brain controlled
[2856.08 --> 2860.72]  interface do you think that's what could make the push from for vr to become less of an experience
[2860.72 --> 2868.72]  and more of an everyday product uh i would say that the brain control interface stuff would have to be
[2870.16 --> 2873.04]  way better than any version i have ever used
[2873.04 --> 2883.60]  um and i doubt it um if it was then sweet but i find a lot of them end up turning into um
[2886.16 --> 2893.60]  less less like neural impulse control and more uh facial muscle movements um because you actually
[2893.60 --> 2898.24]  get a lot more man it's been a long time since i've read this up so i'm gonna say some things wrong
[2898.24 --> 2905.28]  but like the electrical whatever stuff you get a lot more of it by just like smiling right so so a
[2905.28 --> 2910.40]  lot of it ends up being like you just move your face around and that interfaces with it better um
[2911.36 --> 2916.72]  but i mean maybe they have a way better version i don't know i'd love to try this yeah at the very
[2916.72 --> 2923.84]  least apparently it's crazy crazy high resolution and i think it costs like two grand or something like
[2923.84 --> 2933.12]  that like what damn oh the arrow well okay i think the arrow is not the like crazy okay well that one's
[2933.12 --> 2942.48]  two grand so there's that uh man could it possibly be worth double a valve index
[2944.48 --> 2949.60]  uh yeah valve index is kind of old at this point yeah i guess that's i guess that's fair especially
[2949.60 --> 2956.80]  in a market that's like so cutting edge yeah yeah i guess that's i guess that's fair it's just it's
[2956.80 --> 2963.84]  easy to forget 200 hertz oh no that's the eye tracking i guess it's easy to forget that there's a ton
[2964.40 --> 2970.24]  of other vr headset companies out there they just are almost all focused on commercial products because
[2970.24 --> 2978.88]  that's where the money is someone tagged me saying eeg it's not an eeg though they're not like wiring you up
[2978.88 --> 2984.08]  i don't i seriously doubt that a company is going to trust end users to wire themselves up with an eeg
[2984.88 --> 2990.80]  properly um like that's i i i've never seen this product i didn't pay enough attention when you were
[2990.80 --> 2994.72]  showing it on screen to look for how they did it i can pretty much guarantee you they didn't do it that
[2994.72 --> 3002.72]  way um so it's yeah i don't know um again if it's way better that's fantastic i'm not saying it isn't
[3002.72 --> 3008.32]  i'm just saying the ones that i have used were like far from ready for that type of application but
[3008.88 --> 3014.72]  all right they're far from ready to rely on yeah we've had a lot of people interested in the
[3014.72 --> 3019.52]  backpack and screwdriver so shout out to that a couple of you last questions relating uh to
[3019.52 --> 3028.40]  specifics do you know if the screwdriver uh will take little heads from other brands uh yes but you'll
[3028.40 --> 3034.64]  need an adapter i believe the i fix it kit comes with an adapter for their small bits to uh what is it
[3034.64 --> 3039.84]  a quarter inch hex drive i think is the like the standard one and yes there would be there would
[3039.84 --> 3046.40]  be absolutely no reason for that to not for that to not work we just passed 21 000 subscribers on
[3046.40 --> 3053.60]  flowplane oh nice let's go we also have almost 15 000 people watching on youtube this is the best viewed
[3053.60 --> 3059.44]  uh wanshow in quite some time thanks guys thanks for tuning in everyone hit us another question
[3059.44 --> 3064.80]  relating to the backpack is there any sort of weather resistance uh it does have weather
[3064.80 --> 3072.88]  resistant zippers and we have had the uh we have had the fabric tested by an independent third party
[3072.88 --> 3079.28]  it's not you're not going to be able to dunk it underwater like it's not designed for that but if you
[3079.28 --> 3085.92]  were you know if you had a 20 minute commute you know on your bike and it's oh no it started raining
[3085.92 --> 3091.52]  you'll you'll be fine so i just want to jump in really quick some people are talking about the
[3092.16 --> 3100.00]  uh eeg thing uh yes it is it is facial some people have confirmed that it is facial and i i bet you
[3100.00 --> 3105.36]  because it's facial there's going to be huge amounts of interference from you moving your face
[3105.36 --> 3110.88]  and if you ever want to be in an application where you'd have like a voice call you talking is probably
[3110.88 --> 3115.84]  going to introduce lots of problems now if they can prove me wrong like i said earlier that's
[3115.84 --> 3120.80]  awesome i don't want to be right about this it sounds like it could be really cool um i just
[3120.80 --> 3128.80]  have never seen one that's anywhere near ready for a to be relied on in this type of situation
[3128.80 --> 3133.92]  um and i doubt that it is ready but if it is that's great i would i would love to be wrong that explains a
[3133.92 --> 3137.20]  ton i mean obviously at that price it would come with a free facial
[3137.20 --> 3142.16]  oh
[3142.16 --> 3145.84]  next no we gotta let him sit in that
[3150.80 --> 3158.32]  nick light asks what's that nice lanyard uh beside your water bottle oh yes we finally launched the
[3158.32 --> 3164.16]  lanyard that i've been wearing for like the last it's upside down oh we finally launched the lanyard that
[3164.16 --> 3168.16]  i've been wearing for like the last six months it's the wanyard
[3172.16 --> 3177.60]  anthony named it anthony named it it's his fault it's pretty it's a pretty cute name it's our standard
[3177.60 --> 3183.12]  black lanyard it's a little bit longer than the old ones we actually did get some feedback that for
[3183.12 --> 3190.24]  people who wear them around their neck it was just a touch short uh so it's a touch longer we haven't we
[3190.24 --> 3194.64]  haven't you know officially you know revved it or anything like that but i think it's like
[3194.64 --> 3200.48]  an inch longer on each side or something like that uh so it's got orange uh orange um
[3202.24 --> 3207.68]  what would it be like embroidery whatever it is orange stitching for the linus tech tips and then it's
[3207.68 --> 3213.76]  it's a it's a black lanyard so yeah like i said that's the one that's the one i've been using love it
[3213.76 --> 3220.40]  definitely has a nice little pop to it and then we also have a deal to announce this week we are
[3220.40 --> 3230.40]  going to be running the uh offer code where is it i can't find it summer sweat discount we uh i know
[3230.40 --> 3235.84]  it's june but we are overstocked on sweat kits so
[3235.84 --> 3246.32]  because we are also a little bit overstocked on um beanies right now if you pick up a swacket
[3246.32 --> 3253.28]  and a beanie you will get a 20 discount code automatically applied to your order
[3255.92 --> 3261.20]  really great feedback on the swacket it's exactly the same garment that has four and a half stars from
[3261.20 --> 3267.52]  all the other folks who have bought it over the years um yeah there you go so you guys can check
[3267.52 --> 3273.28]  that out the i don't believe you have to do anything special let me just check yeah if you

[3279.68 --> 3286.72]  at lttstore.com all right what's our next topic you really want to talk about tim horton's tracking
[3286.72 --> 3290.80]  people don't you not really to be honest oh i just thought it was funny what do you want to do then
[3290.80 --> 3296.32]  basically everyone's tracking everyone don't trust anything with your data ever and if you install
[3296.32 --> 3301.12]  an app it there's a very high chance that it's like doing bad things do you prefer the military
[3301.12 --> 3307.52]  secret sub worth under thing okay i don't know what's going on here but i read that title it's very
[3307.52 --> 3314.80]  funny okay apparently i i knew this happened and i'm pretty sure we talked about on wan show like
[3315.68 --> 3320.32]  in the old set i think that's the right time frame for it this is the dumbest shiz man
[3320.32 --> 3326.32]  but apparently another classified document has shown up on the war thunder forums in order to
[3326.32 --> 3331.84]  quell an argument making this apparently the third time in a year on the exact same forums
[3331.84 --> 3337.76]  that this has happened a classified military document this time apparently a chinese tank
[3337.76 --> 3342.64]  crew member leaked classified information about a tank shell including a part of this shell itself
[3342.64 --> 3355.28]  oh man um the tank shell in question is the type dtc 10 125 millimeter armor piercing fin stabilized
[3355.28 --> 3362.80]  discarding sabo uh sabo round used in the type 96 and type 99 series main battle tanks the document
[3362.80 --> 3371.04]  indicates the velocity precision penetration rate physical structure of the penetrator primer type
[3371.04 --> 3377.28]  the physical structure of the penetrator oh yeah nice nice uh primer type and handling instructions
[3380.48 --> 3381.68]  oh man
[3381.68 --> 3395.28]  i mean can you imagine can you imagine violating a government military nda to settle an argument no bro on
[3395.28 --> 3400.16]  a forum this tank is way better than you think it needs a buff
[3404.16 --> 3407.84]  i want to drive the tank that i drive in real life digitally and it needs to be just as good
[3407.84 --> 3417.20]  as good as you can see it yeah yeah yeah so epic oh man i just i i can't even and the fact that
[3417.20 --> 3426.08]  this is happening on a regular basis i mean like okay this is this is our discussion this is our
[3426.08 --> 3433.12]  discussion topic here um while the idea that people will leak national security information that
[3433.12 --> 3439.20]  could get themselves potentially killed right because if you have access to this information
[3439.20 --> 3445.52]  presumably it's like your gear right that could get themselves killed in order to win an argument
[3446.32 --> 3452.72]  while that's hilarious the end result is that these crew members if they are crew members they might not
[3452.72 --> 3457.68]  be crew members they might be designers we don't know are harming themselves or working like logistics
[3457.68 --> 3465.84]  or something weird um anthony says as one you to ride watch who plays dcs growling sidewinder puts it
[3465.84 --> 3472.64]  wikipedia data is wrong on purpose no country is going to give out the real specs for their stuff
[3472.64 --> 3478.16]  because then potential adversaries will know how to defend against it if a guy leaks data because they
[3478.16 --> 3484.72]  don't like how the game simulates their hardware guess what you then need to scrap it and start over from
[3484.72 --> 3496.48]  scratch like war is bad yes i am i am across the board against violence from one human being to another human being
[3498.00 --> 3506.72]  yeah okay but if a belligerent nation knows how to bypass another's defenses then they could be emboldened to
[3506.72 --> 3514.24]  act and then everyone is going to have a bad time because war is bad there are knock-on effects
[3514.24 --> 3520.40]  from any conflicts that are going to no matter how far away you are are going to affect you i mean
[3520.40 --> 3527.44]  there's all the grain that's rotting in ukraine right now for example that's terrible people who had
[3527.44 --> 3534.24]  nothing to do with this conflict are going to die like a huge amount of the world's calories come from
[3534.24 --> 3539.76]  there there will be people that starve because of this and and like it's not just going to stop like if
[3539.76 --> 3547.60]  there's a if there's a truce signed or whatever it's it's not like they have to plant and then grow
[3547.60 --> 3554.08]  the dumbest part of all of this is that gaijin war thunders developer in the past has already
[3554.08 --> 3560.72]  demonstrated that they refuse to use this leaked information in the game because they don't want to
[3560.72 --> 3566.56]  incentivize people to leak classified military documents because that's actually a bad thing that makes sense
[3569.76 --> 3575.28]  oh so why don't we talk about the other two incidents in july 2021 a player was arguing about
[3575.28 --> 3580.56]  the british challenger 2 main battle tank to settle the disagreement they posted basically the tank's
[3580.56 --> 3585.68]  operating manual an action that quickly got the uk ministry of defense involved then three months
[3585.68 --> 3591.84]  later a french player claiming to be a crew member in a leclerc serie 2 tank in service since 1992
[3591.84 --> 3597.84]  again got into an argument about the capabilities of their tank my tank and again posted part of the tank's
[3597.84 --> 3606.72]  operation manual come on guys wow the the the round that you were talking about before is apparently
[3606.72 --> 3614.80]  a next-gen round this isn't even old tech yeah that's crazy all right what else we want to talk
[3614.80 --> 3621.04]  about today actually why don't you hit us with a couple more merch messages all right from joshua we
[3621.04 --> 3625.52]  talk a lot about our favorite tech but what's one of the worst tech products you've ever bought i feel
[3625.52 --> 3630.16]  like we had this question like last week yeah i feel like we did i'm not real stoked on my smart
[3630.16 --> 3635.28]  switches right now but that that could not be entirely jasko's fault we'll we'll work on that
[3635.28 --> 3642.16]  we're gonna work on that i feel like i've dodged a lot of bullets um yeah like uh what was that oh man
[3642.16 --> 3650.08]  what was that android console oh yeah oh yeah yeah like like there's been a lot of stuff like i i enjoy
[3650.08 --> 3655.04]  we've talked about this with the with the steam deck right sure i enjoy being really really early
[3655.04 --> 3661.68]  with new stuff sure um so you'd think by doing that that i would have been caught by a bunch of
[3661.68 --> 3666.64]  stuff that was like very below expectations but it hasn't been that bad because i think i've seen a
[3666.64 --> 3672.40]  lot of them coming i've definitely bought some dumb stuff but it would have mostly been on purpose like
[3672.40 --> 3678.40]  the spud the spontaneous pop-up display that little like folding projector second you should
[3678.40 --> 3686.48]  look it up spud monitor uh or like jibo okay i bought a jibo for 800 or whatever that was going to be no
[3686.48 --> 3693.04]  i thought it was going to be terrible i i literally spent money to make money i invested in a jibo
[3693.04 --> 3697.28]  i am the one jibo investor who made out like a bandit on jibo
[3697.28 --> 3702.80]  okay this is interesting yeah i would have thought this would have been bad
[3703.92 --> 3708.96]  here i'll get on your screen it's sold out wow well yeah it's sold out because they don't make
[3708.96 --> 3713.68]  anymore they don't make them apparently they're coming back with a sequel or something really
[3714.24 --> 3717.60]  i don't know someone mentioned it to me in the writers meeting and i was kind of going
[3718.40 --> 3724.08]  really you guys again i guess i don't think someone asked for a hammer update i don't think you can count
[3724.08 --> 3730.80]  the hammer yeah because you never actually got it yeah that's fair enough all right hit me from tommy
[3730.80 --> 3736.24]  what does an ltt script look like is it like a script for tv or movie you gonna show one yeah sure
[3736.24 --> 3743.20]  i'll show one sure why not should i show one for one that hasn't come out yet no no really no you
[3743.20 --> 3750.72]  don't want it to be spicy no all right upload it on flow plane as text um don't show it on wanshow
[3750.72 --> 3757.84]  okay let me uh we got it we got a 13 million dollar building to pay for okay here's one all right so uh
[3759.76 --> 3765.92]  hold on let me just make sure linus's screen is like mostly sanitized oh boy uh yeah linus's screen
[3765.92 --> 3771.20]  should be pretty good now all right here we go so here's the oh crap i don't well i don't have word
[3771.20 --> 3777.04]  on here so i guess oh the juice machine the juice press thing yeah but i don't think yeah neither of us
[3777.04 --> 3784.16]  bought that because it was like obviously obviously stupid yeah no offense if you bought one yeah okay
[3784.16 --> 3789.04]  this is this is what it looks like uh everyone please ensure that the video title is the same for
[3789.04 --> 3794.64]  the folder name script name trello card and calendar entry for the editors the primer project file
[3794.64 --> 3800.00]  sequence exported video file etc um you're supposed to put the author but i wrote this one so i didn't
[3800.00 --> 3805.84]  bother because uh the rules don't apply to me apparently i'm just really i'm really sloppy about these
[3805.84 --> 3809.84]  because people will cover for me thank you everyone i love my team uh we have a float plane
[3809.84 --> 3815.84]  title which is usually pretty plain jane because that's what flow plane likes and then we'll we have
[3815.84 --> 3823.92]  some youtube title ideas um typically we'll have anywhere between two or three all the way up to 10
[3823.92 --> 3830.80]  to 15 potential title ideas uh sometimes it's a lot harder to come up with a title uh we also put a
[3830.80 --> 3837.28]  slogan in here still we don't always roll an intro anymore but if we do we have it here i don't think
[3837.28 --> 3844.16]  we rolled an intro on this one but that's a really funny slogan i'm inside intel get it all right it's
[3844.16 --> 3849.76]  pretty good thumbnail ideas uh product links are expected to be here so that when it comes time to
[3849.76 --> 3853.60]  actually post the video we can have all the applicable product links uh we're supposed to write
[3853.60 --> 3863.28]  up a little description like linus goes full monty wait no that's not it uh anyway uh linus gets uh
[3863.28 --> 3867.20]  behind the scenes of intel you know whatever throw some keywords in there that kind of thing people are
[3867.20 --> 3871.20]  roasting the formatting asking if it's normally centered i don't believe it's normally centered
[3871.20 --> 3875.12]  why would it be centered and i don't think you need fancy formatting for this to be honest yeah this
[3875.12 --> 3879.44]  is all this is all just reference material that would be duplicated on trello anyway
[3879.44 --> 3884.72]  uh there's some reference stuff here just in case people you know need links to hey if you're
[3884.72 --> 3888.72]  screen recording make sure you check out the document for how to do that we have the video
[3888.72 --> 3893.84]  bible this is really important every video should have a hook that grabs people's attention you should
[3893.84 --> 3899.12]  address the title and thumbnail in the first 10 to 20 seconds a naturally embedded relevant merch call
[3899.12 --> 3905.12]  out we've definitely let the relevant part lapse a little bit maybe we could work on that a bit
[3905.12 --> 3909.04]  an affiliate link call out we've actually replaced this with a call out for floatplane quite
[3909.04 --> 3913.04]  recently so that's part of why floatplane subscriber numbers are going up right now for sure yeah an
[3913.04 --> 3916.96]  upcoming video that should compel people to subscribe we've done away with this one because our new
[3916.96 --> 3922.80]  subscriber rate is atrocious anyway so why bother we'll just focus on making sure we're getting served
[3922.80 --> 3927.68]  in uh suggested videos because that's where most of our viewership comes from anyway a throw to a
[3927.68 --> 3931.68]  compelling related video the viewer might want to watch we do that at the end just to try and
[3931.68 --> 3937.20]  try and retain people like say hey if you enjoyed this maybe you'll also enjoy that a primo gifable moment
[3937.20 --> 3943.52]  we see gifs of you know me and uh the rest of the team here as a really great uh as a really great
[3943.52 --> 3950.32]  marketing exercise you know just just more exposure uh for us so we you know we always try and we always
[3950.32 --> 3956.32]  try and put fun little fun little gifable moments into the videos gifable deal with it
[3958.64 --> 3965.52]  um this is a shot that i forgot to get where is it yeah ots of someone blocking lines partially and
[3965.52 --> 3969.92]  linus eyes closed waving hand away like no no no indicating refusing a check we forgot to get this
[3970.40 --> 3974.80]  we did get this one this was just like me making little notes this isn't normally in the template
[3974.80 --> 3980.08]  any props we need it's nice to get that i had the intro that was shot the previous day when i thought
[3980.08 --> 3985.84]  it was going to be sponsored um so i have hey make sure you use that and it's supposed to say until
[3985.84 --> 3991.28]  sponsored this video cut it off hard here um because that was supposed to have the sponsorship
[3991.28 --> 3995.52]  disclosure in it but it we didn't end up having it be sponsored because i wanted to make sure that i
[3995.52 --> 4002.32]  could just say whatever i needed to say without them being able to push back on it uh intel tends
[4002.32 --> 4007.92]  to be very sensitive about things like their internal processes and and engineering facilities so
[4008.88 --> 4013.36]  i feel like if it had been sponsored the way it was supposed to like a fully sponsored video they
[4013.36 --> 4017.68]  would have expected to dictate a lot more of the content and i just i saw that place and i was like
[4017.68 --> 4025.12]  nah dog we may never look at this again it needs to be everything um all right so then this is what
[4025.12 --> 4029.44]  the script looks like since i'll sponsored this vid cut it off hard here at least they tried i've never
[4029.44 --> 4032.72]  done this before but shortly after i arrived at intel's israel design center i ripped up the
[4032.72 --> 4040.80]  previously agreed upon sponsorship check so here you're basically seeing what is in the video um
[4040.80 --> 4046.64]  these marks here tend to be for if i'm moving locations so two four is going to be in the
[4046.64 --> 4053.68]  validation lab you can see three one so this is like a completely different segment um three two
[4053.68 --> 4059.68]  is where we kind of move to a different part of that room at the end you'll see you know any sponsor
[4059.68 --> 4063.60]  spots or anything like that we've actually recently started shooting those separately and then just
[4063.60 --> 4069.20]  chopping them into the video again so you won't see those anymore the thing you're missing and this
[4069.20 --> 4075.60]  could be partly because it's a script by me and i tend not to write guidance sometimes because i'm busy
[4075.60 --> 4081.68]  um it could also be because i opened it in wordpad rather than in word but we often have annotations
[4081.68 --> 4087.44]  in the right margin that will highlight so they're comments right so you highlight the text that you
[4087.44 --> 4092.72]  want covered and then you'll annotate a graph that's supposed to have coverage there or a b-roll shot or
[4093.36 --> 4099.68]  um like text that you want to appear on screen or if you want a simple animation done then that'll be on the side
[4099.68 --> 4105.52]  and that's uh that's what they look like i'm not sure i'm not sure how that compares to
[4106.48 --> 4110.96]  whatever your expectations were but for better or for worse that's it
[4115.04 --> 4121.52]  very nice uh from edward what's been the most surprising part of the growth of lmg over the last
[4121.52 --> 4131.36]  couple years how much it costs i don't know speed uh probably create a warehouse fast i mean i was i
[4131.36 --> 4137.12]  was i was pretty bearish on the on the whole physical goods business and there still are
[4137.12 --> 4142.00]  challenges like it's not nearly as profitable as it kind of seems to be you know you look at the gross
[4142.00 --> 4149.04]  margin on on a product and it might be like oh yeah you know you're making uh of that ten dollars five
[4149.04 --> 4156.96]  dollars is profit but actually by the time you account for handling fees and packing materials
[4157.60 --> 4166.08]  and uh transaction uh overhead and you account for the actual rates big the uh people who had to work
[4166.08 --> 4173.20]  on that product and and all of that stuff so okay yeah prices could be a little higher that sort of thing
[4173.20 --> 4180.96]  from dean i have a question for luke you said a week or two ago that you may not get the steam deck
[4180.96 --> 4185.52]  when your email comes yeah is there a different handheld you would consider or using steam os instead
[4185.52 --> 4192.24]  of windows not really to be completely honest um the steam os versus windows thing doesn't really matter to
[4192.24 --> 4198.48]  me um i don't mind uh like like from doing the linux challenge i don't think i mind linux in that
[4198.48 --> 4208.64]  situation uh no problem with it there yeah um and steam os is it's linux but it's like smoother it's
[4208.64 --> 4212.88]  yeah i've heard good things about it so that's that that part doesn't really matter to me much
[4212.88 --> 4219.84]  um and i was mostly interested because i i mostly wanted one because i really respected their approach
[4219.84 --> 4223.92]  to right to repair what they're planning on doing with i fix it which has started coming to fruition which
[4223.92 --> 4230.08]  is really cool yeah um and i wanted to see kind of how this thing grew um but now by the time i get
[4230.08 --> 4236.96]  it it's going to be like old so i yeah i'm still not necessarily i don't know i haven't fully decided
[4236.96 --> 4243.28]  but i probably won't end up actually buying it i'll take yours yeah i'm sure you'll be able to find a
[4243.28 --> 4251.12]  taker for it yeah yeah exactly yeah i'll probably just offload it oh man well this is annoying
[4251.12 --> 4256.08]  google is apparently killing location-based reminders in the assistant
[4258.08 --> 4267.04]  man i i have had i have had a very frustrating week with google assistant can i show you something
[4267.04 --> 4276.08]  really stupid can i show you something stupid right now yeah okay this is my google news feed oh
[4276.08 --> 4282.08]  no no sorry hold on a second so i set i set reminders to set alarms because i don't trust
[4282.08 --> 4286.64]  the reminders to actually get my attention oh yeah no reminders are horrible yeah yeah they're they're
[4286.64 --> 4292.00]  they're useless i i always remind myself with alarms but that's completely that's completely separate okay
[4292.00 --> 4299.36]  so this is my google news feed how would you categorize uh these these topics as we go through tech tech
[4299.36 --> 4314.80]  uh movie film whatever tech uh business tech uh business government something like that tech tech
[4315.84 --> 4325.36]  it's mostly tech okay yeah all right because i own linus media group i have gotten in the habit of using
[4325.36 --> 4332.80]  using my linus media group email account as my primary google account this is a paid account it's
[4332.80 --> 4337.52]  called a g suite account used to be called google apps now it's called g suite that's not the point the
[4337.52 --> 4344.40]  point is that i am a paying ass customer for my gmail so you should get less features than free customers
[4345.04 --> 4353.28]  hold on for my gmail my google drive basically any other service that i use one nice feature is what did you
[4353.28 --> 4363.52]  not see in here uh i i starts with a and ends with dis advertisements no ads right which is okay that's
[4363.52 --> 4370.08]  fairly nice also i would expect it given that i pay actually a significant amount of money to google
[4370.08 --> 4378.64]  now that we are up to like whatever we have to 70 people plus flow plane like okay so the problem the
[4378.64 --> 4382.96]  full plane bill is cheaper because we don't have as much drive space as you guys my drive is 98 full
[4382.96 --> 4393.44]  on my flow plane email the problem is that google has time and time again treated g suite users as
[4393.44 --> 4398.88]  second-class citizens oh yeah absolutely there was a period of over a year where reminders aside from
[4398.88 --> 4405.20]  being garbage and they're not being an easy way to set a decently long ringtone for them um there was
[4405.20 --> 4409.20]  a period of over a year where reminders didn't work you literally got an error that was like yeah
[4409.20 --> 4419.68]  reminders are not available for for g suite users why why take that code and put it there well no but but
[4419.68 --> 4429.28]  do it yeah no but yes okay okay now let me show you something
[4431.84 --> 4434.88]  open the front right garage door oh i saw this
[4438.24 --> 4444.40]  okay so no this is not no no no no no no my tweet last night about open the right front garage door and
[4444.40 --> 4449.12]  it opening like the back garage door no no that's separate from this that's just oh that's just natural
[4449.12 --> 4455.76]  language processing being still amazingly crappy no no this is this is separate okay so here hold on
[4456.80 --> 4458.24]  open the front right garage door
[4460.72 --> 4464.80]  sorry i don't understand okay because
[4466.56 --> 4469.44]  yeah why like that seems like that should be something that it should get i don't i don't
[4469.44 --> 4476.00]  know yeah for google for home which is a separate app okay so i got my home app right
[4477.12 --> 4484.00]  this is where you add your devices and stuff right okay so you can add your your thermostats and your
[4484.00 --> 4492.72]  speakers and your garage doors all your all your smart home crap okay if i try to invite a home member
[4492.72 --> 4501.44]  let's say for example that i was to try to invite uh luke okay okay so i'm gonna no no you're not gonna
[4501.44 --> 4507.36]  need that okay because i'm gonna go through i'm gonna invite you can't send the invitation at the
[4507.36 --> 4513.28]  moment try again try again try again try again why because you're a g suite user oh no way
[4513.28 --> 4523.44]  you may not oh oh oh the best part was that i was i was as a g suite user i was the owner of the home
[4524.08 --> 4531.12]  but i couldn't invite g suite users or non-g suite users because i was a g suite user i had to change
[4531.12 --> 4537.76]  so that a non-g suite user owned it and then i couldn't invite g suite users at all so i'm allowed to
[4537.76 --> 4542.96]  own it as a g suite user but i am not allowed to invite g suite users and then if i am a regular
[4542.96 --> 4549.92]  at gmail.com user i still cannot invite g suite users to this home that's so but the error message
[4549.92 --> 4557.60]  is not meaningful it just says sorry you couldn't do it try again okay now this gets really frustrating
[4557.60 --> 4565.44]  now that i go into the home app and i sign into i will admit i i hate uh useless error messages i will
[4565.44 --> 4570.72]  admit floatplane has a few um i would also argue that our team size is a little bit smaller than
[4570.72 --> 4579.92]  google okay so i've switched over to my proper home one oh are you are you kidding me okay there we go
[4579.92 --> 4586.24]  i've switched over because because when it comes to different google uh apps on your phone right so
[4586.24 --> 4590.08]  there's like your news feed and there's then there's home and then there's the assistant or whatever
[4590.08 --> 4597.04]  they all sync there's like your your like primary google account right so watch this open the front
[4597.04 --> 4604.88]  right garage door sure opening the front right garage door okay because now i'm logged into my
[4604.88 --> 4611.76]  like proper home one yeah okay but now i go to my news feed okay i'd like you to categorize these things
[4611.76 --> 4622.32]  for me uh business stuff business stuff government stuff whatever uh medical stuff uh business stuff
[4623.44 --> 4631.36]  ad let's do you see any tech in here very little okay and here's where it gets even worse bell do you
[4631.36 --> 4636.72]  know how to adjust the focus on that okay this is some next level dumb crap
[4636.72 --> 4646.16]  this is google being bad at their one job okay i'd like to fix this obviously the best way would
[4646.16 --> 4649.76]  be if i could just import my work profile because now i'm stuck with this one if i want any of my
[4649.76 --> 4654.64]  smart home stuff to work right right i'm because i'm not gonna i'm not gonna have to go up and you
[4654.64 --> 4659.76]  switch which account uses which thing no no no once you change it for one it changes it for all of
[4659.76 --> 4670.40]  them thank you very much google all right here's where it gets way dumber okay here we go ready okay
[4670.40 --> 4676.88]  can you guys hear me i have no idea so i go into my channels and interests okay so i'm gonna be like hey
[4676.88 --> 4691.28]  i like tech okay following this is all literally just random songs and and artists from my youtube music
[4692.16 --> 4699.44]  if i block them i have gone through and painstakingly blocked them all before okay let's go back
[4699.44 --> 4709.52]  they just come back okay it's just full of random music again they are not in not interested okay i
[4709.52 --> 4715.68]  haven't hidden anything apparently and there is no button anywhere to add interests
[4720.08 --> 4726.80]  i thought your whole thing i thought your whole thing is that you're supposed to want to know everything
[4726.80 --> 4732.96]  i'm willfully i'm willingly telling you i would like to give you my personal information so that
[4732.96 --> 4742.64]  you may better tailor content to me and you will not do it so i can't pay my way out of this problem
[4742.64 --> 4749.44]  i can't manually input data my way out of this problem and it's not like this is obviously this is
[4749.44 --> 4757.84]  obviously not a life or death problem it's just stupid yeah i this is a very minor problem compared
[4757.84 --> 4762.48]  to that but i i have youtube premium close the front right garage door sorry yeah that's a good idea
[4764.56 --> 4771.92]  thanks google i uh so i have youtube premium on my like personal account but i i tried to do the whole
[4771.92 --> 4776.80]  and i i like it this way much more i'm thinking of migrating to firefox again trying that out but
[4776.80 --> 4781.84]  i like it this way much more where i have profiles so i have different browser windows yeah depending
[4781.84 --> 4786.56]  on what the thing is sure um and it's great so i have my flow plane one it's all colored blue so i
[4786.56 --> 4792.48]  know when i'm in my correct work browser and all that kind of stuff um but i don't have youtube premium
[4792.48 --> 4798.56]  on every google account that i use because that would be insane i have it on my work one yeah and now
[4798.56 --> 4804.56]  what i'm gonna buy it again like no that's crazy so and like usually if i'm in my work when i'm probably
[4804.56 --> 4808.88]  on float plane right so it doesn't matter there's no ads but i if i do have to open a youtube link
[4808.88 --> 4814.80]  for some reason and it opens up on my work one then there's ads everywhere and i'm like oh okay i have
[4814.80 --> 4819.84]  to copy this out open close on this one open on this other one watch it there get rid of that browser
[4819.84 --> 4823.76]  when i'm done because now none of my work stuff is here jump back over to this one it's just if i have
[4823.76 --> 4830.96]  one account logged in on my phone that has youtube premium it should count count it yeah like i'm not
[4830.96 --> 4836.40]  gonna buy separate youtube premium i have like 12 google accounts logged in on my phone yeah because
[4836.40 --> 4843.36]  of all the youtube channels and all that stuff right like it come on stop treating g suite users
[4843.36 --> 4850.00]  like second class citizens so now my feed is full of ads full of not tech and if i want any of my home
[4850.00 --> 4856.00]  stuff to work then and if i want my youtube premium to work i just have to be constantly switching what
[4856.00 --> 4865.20]  profile i'm on it's just really annoying it's just stupid oh escapement dog says also g suite stopped
[4865.20 --> 4870.32]  supporting google where too yeah it doesn't surprise me it was just one thing after another after another
[4870.32 --> 4874.72]  like all these years i forget all the times that i've been really annoyed trying to use a g suite
[4874.72 --> 4878.96]  account as my daily driver account i had a problem for a super long time where i couldn't change my
[4878.96 --> 4885.92]  profile picture and i was like and it would just say like there was an error with this photo or
[4885.92 --> 4890.32]  whatever but i would try like a billion different photos and it never work and i was just like well
[4891.12 --> 4896.00]  i guess my account's just like broken because the error was like super weird it had nothing to do with
[4896.00 --> 4901.20]  like permissions or account levels or whatever it was just there was a problem with this image so i was
[4901.20 --> 4905.84]  like oh okay whatever and then eventually i figured out that someone else on the team couldn't change
[4905.84 --> 4911.28]  their profile picture either and i was like what that's got to be a setting so i dove way through
[4911.28 --> 4920.56]  the settings and by default it has it off like why why would this be off at any time so i just turn
[4920.56 --> 4924.24]  it on and then it worked fine but like it doesn't tell you were talking about the error being weird it
[4924.24 --> 4929.84]  didn't tell me yeah no why don't you just say that yeah then yeah maybe because when they say that
[4929.84 --> 4934.96]  it generates a bunch of complaints that the feature doesn't work because it should be on by default
[4934.96 --> 4943.60]  oh so frustrating so stupid uh anyways we have tons of topics this week yeah uh well jake's got to
[4943.60 --> 4950.88]  hit us with a couple more merch messages first all right all right from matthew in your opinion with
[4950.88 --> 4956.32]  oh we're getting a ton of merch messages here just a second back to being matthew in your opinion with
[4956.32 --> 4961.20]  performance per generation leapfrogging and larger power draws coming are we looking at performance plateaus with
[4961.20 --> 4967.68]  an increased focus on efficiency and usability or ever increasing performance peaks i think it's
[4967.68 --> 4973.52]  cyclical at this point i mean we've seen this in the past when architecturally they can't find a way to
[4973.52 --> 4981.76]  get a leg up on the competition they'll push the power envelope and obviously it's better for the silicon to run
[4981.76 --> 4989.20]  cooler fewer warranty issues uh whenever they can they'll try to run it as efficiently as possible so i think we're just
[4989.20 --> 4995.28]  seeing whatever we're seeing an ebb or a flow whatever whichever one is which right now yeah can you
[4995.28 --> 5003.12]  share the hilarious moment i would love to um uh cal and ann is uh is helping us out with some sanding
[5003.12 --> 5007.84]  for like a paint project that we're working on says thanks for closing the door on me
[5007.84 --> 5014.32]  wait so it was already open i'm assuming
[5014.32 --> 5024.80]  oh man oh anthony is complaining about g suite g suite also doesn't let you import data you can
[5024.80 --> 5028.64]  export everything from a google account but good luck doing literally anything with it
[5028.64 --> 5039.68]  that's funny that's pretty good i didn't know that come on and like i could spend the next six months
[5039.68 --> 5044.32]  using my google news feed again because when i first started using it it was crap it was full of like
[5044.88 --> 5051.20]  kim kardashian and the royals and just like all that absolute garbage that i couldn't possibly care less
[5051.20 --> 5057.76]  about uh he says no it's not a problem just weirded me out okay good um mine gets randomly obsessed with
[5057.76 --> 5062.56]  things i was like i am gonna invest in this i'm gonna give this a chance because other people tell
[5062.56 --> 5068.08]  me it's really good so i i did i stuck it out and took months and it's like really good now like it's
[5068.08 --> 5072.56]  like you you saw it's just full of tech yeah basically mine's pretty good but every once in a
[5072.56 --> 5077.44]  while it'll latch onto something really weird and even if i never click on it it'll just keep coming
[5077.44 --> 5082.64]  up keep coming up keeping up and then it'll randomly disappear i googled what the hell bts was once and
[5082.64 --> 5090.80]  oh no oh man it was just like whatever jimin was wearing yesterday for a while yeah yeah yeah
[5092.64 --> 5096.64]  like mine i don't i don't like you know honestly it seems like they do a lot of great stuff
[5097.52 --> 5102.80]  but i don't care what jimin's wearing no yeah yeah i i don't watch very many tv shows i don't watch very
[5102.80 --> 5109.92]  many movies yeah and i am not interested in actors or actresses pretty much at all and randomly
[5111.28 --> 5116.16]  i'll get like this person that i've very likely never heard of and like every three articles will
[5116.16 --> 5121.44]  be about like some shirt they were wearing or something yeah and i'm like holy crap i have never
[5121.44 --> 5125.28]  clicked on one of these and i don't care and then like it'll keep happening for like three or
[5125.28 --> 5129.28]  four days and then it'll disappear and never come back again yeah like why did it think that was a
[5129.28 --> 5135.68]  thing one of the really frustrating ones for me is one of your only interactions is not interested
[5135.68 --> 5142.88]  yeah right you can't say i want more of this but the problem is that if you have literally already read
[5142.88 --> 5150.24]  it and it shows up you can't say like i've had ones that show up over and over and over again you can't
[5150.24 --> 5155.92]  say it's less lately but you can't say the thing that is the problem with this is that i already read it
[5155.92 --> 5161.68]  because that would be a really great signal oh like i read this and enjoyed it or something like
[5161.68 --> 5168.00]  that yes yes i did engage with this i actually do like this but i do not wish to click on it right now
[5168.00 --> 5172.48]  yeah i i really i think they didn't they used to have like a thumbs up like more of this thought so
[5172.48 --> 5177.60]  yeah i thought because i remember tuning mine back in the day with like i like this i don't like that
[5177.60 --> 5183.44]  it's frustrating when economics take a front seat compared to the user experience i've talked about
[5183.44 --> 5188.96]  this on when show before but one of my favorite features on amazon back in the day was customers
[5188.96 --> 5196.40]  who viewed this ended up buying yeah these things and clearly that was interfering with their ability
[5196.40 --> 5203.52]  to put sponsored product showcases under them and it went away and i was so angry because it saved me
[5204.08 --> 5210.96]  so much time i could just find approximately the thing that i was kind of looking for and someone else
[5210.96 --> 5216.40]  would have already done the work of digging through the trash heap that is amazon's interface
[5216.96 --> 5221.76]  and finding the like handful of good ones so that i could pick the one that best suits my needs
[5222.64 --> 5228.96]  it's so infuriating yeah i do like by the way on google news that you can block entire domains
[5229.68 --> 5235.44]  oh i did not know that that's actually sweet i'll go to a site and just get like destroyed by ads and
[5235.44 --> 5239.92]  i'll just back out and be like never again oh i should start doing that with like the paywall ones yes
[5239.92 --> 5243.68]  it's at the point now where a quarter of the articles in mine are paywalls i don't get any
[5243.68 --> 5247.52]  paywall stuff because i've blocked them all got it that makes sense that's sweet
[5249.20 --> 5254.64]  from john would you ever consider producing written content or written versions of our videos
[5254.64 --> 5258.88]  i often find myself looking for more articles on a product or topic rather than a video
[5258.88 --> 5265.60]  someone linked me an old wanshow where you um and me i guess technically but we were we
[5265.60 --> 5269.52]  were figuring out what we wanted to do with the forum yeah and you were talking about how we were
[5269.52 --> 5274.08]  going to use vbulletin and one of the main reasons why you wanted vbulletin was because it had this like
[5274.08 --> 5281.60]  powerful cms behind it and you could put written companions up with videos so yeah it's been considered
[5281.60 --> 5283.60]  weird
[5284.80 --> 5293.12]  what's this this is it this is the time ed redesign oh the home page of the linus tech tips forum
[5294.24 --> 5304.40]  to um hold on where's the oh here we go okay so this is the mock-up of what linus tech tips dot com
[5304.40 --> 5311.12]  would have looked like before dark mode was the default for the universe yeah uh so linus tech tips
[5311.12 --> 5318.08]  forums members gallery this is just a lot of placeholders um we'd have you know headlines
[5318.08 --> 5325.12]  news items sorry i think we still use that banner uh yes i think we do uh there's you know your link
[5325.12 --> 5334.24]  to wanshow gotta love that ancient wanshow logo heck yeah i have no idea this is obviously just
[5334.24 --> 5339.60]  crap that ed put in here uh let's have a look at some more things if you guys are interested in
[5339.60 --> 5346.56]  this here's what an article preview would look like i think article twitter preview it says i don't know
[5346.56 --> 5353.20]  what that means uh we had this cool idea where we would have community submissions for news articles kind
[5353.20 --> 5358.16]  of like just the news section on the forum and there'd be a tip jar for the author i thought that was
[5358.16 --> 5365.36]  kind of a a cool idea um just to encourage people to to to like post more and summarize add their own
[5365.36 --> 5371.20]  thoughts people who were really prolific and really good at it could potentially like actually do pretty
[5371.20 --> 5380.56]  decent uh this was i think this might have been an earlier or later version of the home page look at
[5380.56 --> 5389.60]  that old youtube logo love it look at this date oh man this might be an earlier one this might be an
[5389.60 --> 5397.68]  earlier one what am i looking at here oh spicy top build logs remember when we used to feature build
[5397.68 --> 5403.04]  logs from the build log section of the forum i yeah that was awesome i should kind of miss that here's
[5403.04 --> 5409.28]  the compact no this one's this one's nothing linus's mock-up oh okay apparently i did this
[5410.48 --> 5414.96]  the headlines chosen by the community for the community i don't think i've ever shown this before
[5415.76 --> 5421.04]  never saw the light of day buy from our affiliates i saw these tips in the jar no no yeah to you yeah but
[5421.68 --> 5427.12]  features plot for these fast as possible uh top build logs decaying mechanism and based on likes oh
[5427.12 --> 5435.60]  yeah interesting yeah kind of kind of cool idea kind of cool idea uh yeah neat huh
[5438.88 --> 5444.08]  well now you saw a little piece of a little piece of ltt history hope you enjoyed it
[5446.64 --> 5453.92]  from grant will linus be on they're just movies again also what made you start the series um i i don't
[5453.92 --> 5460.24]  know if they invite me and i have time i'd be happy to do it as for what made me start it uh james
[5460.24 --> 5465.52]  reilly and david would always spend their work time talking about movies and they had the idea of
[5465.52 --> 5471.12]  starting a podcast and i was like well i guess it was on it was during their carpool they would spend a
[5471.12 --> 5474.32]  lot of time talking about them and then it would bleed over into work time and i'd hear them talking
[5474.32 --> 5478.72]  about it and they were like hey we want to do like a movie podcast and i was like oh cool let's uh try
[5478.72 --> 5484.16]  and support that and so we did and so now we have the they're just movies podcast because they thought
[5484.16 --> 5490.96]  carpool critics was not as good of a name yeah no comment they definitely did i have no comment on
[5490.96 --> 5499.60]  the i have no comment on the quality of they're just movies instead of carpool carpool critics movie
[5499.60 --> 5508.00]  podcast uh we have a um oh boy where'd it go i think i lost the comment uh but it was a question
[5508.00 --> 5512.72]  about the newsletter if we're going to do another newsletter again another newsletter what kind of
[5512.72 --> 5519.44]  newsletter i'm assuming they're talking about the ldt store because i wasn't sure either oh yes they're
[5519.44 --> 5524.88]  supposed to do them like every week or every other week so they've just been they've just been swamped
[5524.88 --> 5530.72]  right like they just moved they've got a lot of projects to ship you know backpacks screwdrivers
[5530.72 --> 5536.80]  lots of other things that we've got going on behind the scenes just yeah it just takes time so i am also
[5536.80 --> 5544.64]  not commenting but float plane chat is i think unanimously saying that carpool critics is better
[5545.36 --> 5551.12]  all right i i have no comment on float plane chats comment yeah no interesting me neither nope moving on
[5551.12 --> 5556.80]  if you like carpool critics better go like their latest video so we know that that you like the
[5556.80 --> 5562.72]  old name that's some big brain stuff oh man this is this question from anonymous what do you think
[5562.72 --> 5569.44]  about the upcoming google pixel watch that's coming out frankly i have spent exactly zero of my precious
[5569.44 --> 5575.76]  brain cycles on the google pixel watch because i have no hope for it whatsoever and that might be me
[5575.76 --> 5581.76]  just being closed-minded but this is not the first time google has said no for real it's different this
[5581.76 --> 5589.36]  time i will believe it when i see it when it is on my wrist and it's amazing i will be amazed otherwise
[5589.36 --> 5595.20]  i just i i'm just i'm not i'm not going to become emotionally invested in this thing i'm sorry i just can't
[5595.20 --> 5604.40]  do it what's this uh this is a withings um ah crap what's it called again smart something can't
[5604.40 --> 5609.68]  remember it's a withings watch full disclosure uh the reason i have it is that they did a sponsorship
[5609.68 --> 5615.76]  but uh turning off my sponsored hat because they sure as heck didn't sponsor this i'm enjoying it so
[5615.76 --> 5622.88]  far it's got kind of everything you need it looks um very traditional yeah nothing you you don't oh so
[5622.88 --> 5630.24]  it's just a little screen there yeah spo2 and ecg monitoring um it does log workouts and steps and
[5630.24 --> 5636.08]  stuff like that but i was at the point where i just was finding my smartwatch so useless that i
[5636.08 --> 5642.32]  basically just used it to tell the time anyway and this does that great and it lasts for almost a
[5642.32 --> 5648.32]  month on battery and that part i'm assuming will last even longer than that the time no because it
[5648.32 --> 5653.92]  appears to be very digitally controlled gotcha if the electronics die inside i'm pretty sure the arms
[5653.92 --> 5661.92]  stop arming okay yeah because you can set the time in the app and it'll be like oh oh wow yeah okay got
[5661.92 --> 5667.92]  it that's it for merch messages but you do have a couple little unboxings i don't know if you want to
[5667.92 --> 5675.68]  go through oh no let's talk about some more topics i wanted to talk about um new york state actually passed a
[5675.68 --> 5684.72]  couple of really interesting bills uh first up is the fair repair act where which stipulates that all
[5684.72 --> 5691.60]  manufacturers who sell digital electronic products within state borders must make tools parts and
[5691.60 --> 5699.28]  instructions for repair available to both consumers and independent shops heck yeah exceptions are made for
[5699.28 --> 5708.88]  home appliances why medical devices okay and this last one and agriculture equipment don't like that
[5708.88 --> 5714.32]  don't like that at all that's got to be some john deere lobbying right there yes that's exactly it the
[5714.32 --> 5721.68]  the the medical devices one i don't know oh that one i don't know enough things that would fall in that
[5721.68 --> 5728.80]  category and there's a lot of liability there yeah there's i mean honestly though you talk to people
[5728.80 --> 5736.16]  in the medical field they're extremely frustrated that medicine costs so much because of things like
[5736.16 --> 5742.24]  really restrictive contracts for the repair and upkeep of these devices but there's also a lot of
[5742.24 --> 5747.76]  liability depends what it is and like if you take the liability away from the company if you do self
[5747.76 --> 5752.56]  repair i think that's a thing that you should be able to uh decide on your own right but like home
[5752.56 --> 5759.44]  appliances like come on dude yeah geez i'm happy we're making progress right that's always a good
[5759.44 --> 5767.44]  thing but like these exceptions are dumb agreed uh what else we got here so the past legislature is
[5767.44 --> 5771.92]  awaiting signature from the governor they are expected to sign and this comes after biden issued
[5771.92 --> 5777.84]  an executive order calling on the ftc to enforce freaking repair rights all right so that's something good
[5777.84 --> 5784.56]  uh ifixit said it expects this to take effect by 2023 freaking awesome in other news new york passes
[5784.56 --> 5791.20]  a bill to limit bitcoin mining it targets a specific form of crypto mining that uses the highly energy
[5791.20 --> 5796.64]  intensive proof of work authentication method this includes several popular digital currencies including
[5796.64 --> 5801.68]  bitcoin if signed into law this legislation will place a two-year ban on new permits being issued
[5801.68 --> 5807.44]  or existing permits being renewed to conduct proof of work authenticated cryptocurrency mining that relies on
[5807.44 --> 5812.64]  electricity generated from carbon based fuels so this is part of new york's climate goals that
[5812.64 --> 5817.60]  require the state's greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 85 percent by 2050 under the climate
[5817.60 --> 5825.44]  leadership and community protection act so if you found a way um to to work outside of carbon-based
[5825.44 --> 5835.76]  fuels you could still do it yeah cool in other news elon musk wants to cut 10 of tesla jobs but apparently
[5835.76 --> 5841.12]  the hourly headcount will increase and this is mostly focused on salary employees so that's another
[5841.12 --> 5846.72]  way of saying that you feel like you're a little top heavy in terms or middle heavy in terms of
[5846.72 --> 5853.44]  management tesla shares fell nine percent after the report but honestly man i wouldn't read too much into
[5853.44 --> 5861.28]  that for for i'm out of my in i'm out of my investments i have i have no current investments but i do just like
[5861.28 --> 5868.08]  maintain i do i just like look at particular like tech i've got intel amd nvidia in here and it goes
[5868.08 --> 5874.24]  from huge green to big red day to day to day to day to day right now nine percent's a lot
[5875.52 --> 5882.00]  nine percent's a lot but it has been it has been a uh coinbase is down nine percent today too
[5882.56 --> 5888.08]  and yesterday yeah but i mean they were up bitcoin has been getting or not bitcoin coins in general have
[5888.08 --> 5891.60]  been getting kind of slaughtered over the last little bit i mean here's five days so they'll go
[5891.60 --> 5894.80]  day when they're up ten percent they'll go day when they're down they'll go day when they're up you
[5894.80 --> 5899.36]  got a couple people calling you out for framework that's not a publicly traded company yeah sorry
[5899.36 --> 5904.88]  sorry sorry i meant stocks stocks yes i still do i still do hold my investment in framework
[5905.52 --> 5911.44]  okay amc is a meme stock so let's not use that one i think i think amd you still have stock in
[5911.44 --> 5916.00]  framework right yes you're talking tradable stocks yes yes yes yes or what i don't know i don't know
[5916.00 --> 5925.36]  what they're called yes i still that technically they are stocks yes i i have the 280 230 i i don't
[5925.36 --> 5931.04]  remember i don't remember how much because honestly guys wasn't the point i wrote the check
[5933.84 --> 5935.28]  and i hope that they succeed
[5938.08 --> 5940.80]  that's it that's all i can really do i mean i'd like to think that
[5940.80 --> 5946.80]  that um you guys have not noticed a difference in my treatment of framework or other laptop
[5946.80 --> 5951.84]  manufacturers ever since the investment i have actually had very little to do with our laptop
[5951.84 --> 5956.08]  content but when i have had anything to do with it i would hope you guys have seen no difference if
[5956.08 --> 5962.88]  anything my goal is to treat them like the coach's son uh be harder on them as opposed to being any easier
[5962.88 --> 5968.48]  on them had that experience i actually enjoyed that but being the coach's son yeah my dad was a coach
[5968.48 --> 5975.12]  on like basically every sports team i was on that's pretty cool um and he was actually awesome and no
[5975.12 --> 5980.72]  one ever no one on the team ever like maybe the first day they'd be like oh coach's son whatever
[5980.72 --> 5984.56]  and then after it was like a couple weeks in they'd be like oh man i'm sorry bro
[5986.48 --> 5990.08]  which i preferred instead of everyone thinking i was getting special treatment
[5990.08 --> 5996.80]  um yeah it was great i really enjoyed my dad coaching samsung's apparently getting out of the
[5996.80 --> 6004.40]  lcd market isn't that crazy that is wacky lcds are just no forget it we don't need lcds anymore
[6004.40 --> 6010.00]  as early as june samsung display will stop producing lcd panels they used to be the world's
[6010.00 --> 6015.28]  leading lcd panel manufacturer but their market share has dropped to just two percent due to chinese and
[6015.28 --> 6020.88]  taiwanese competition the display supply chain consultants or dscc say the average price index
[6020.88 --> 6031.44]  of lcd panels will drop to 36.6 out of 100 down from 41.5 in april so expect lcds to get cheaper
[6031.44 --> 6036.56]  and to be clear this isn't they're not leaving the like display market no they're just kind of moving
[6036.56 --> 6042.48]  on more than anything they will now focus heavily on oled and quantum dot with most of their employees
[6042.48 --> 6047.92]  moving over to quantum dot there's no official statement from samsung yet our discussion question
[6047.92 --> 6054.64]  is at what point do lcds go the way of crt never oh i mean they will eventually i think there's better
[6054.64 --> 6060.40]  techs out there now i think it'll be different because crts have this like cult following in
[6060.40 --> 6064.88]  existence bulky well they're super bulky but they have this cult following in existence because they
[6064.88 --> 6070.80]  have certain things that they're particularly really good at um and i think that the technologies that
[6070.80 --> 6076.96]  are replacing lcd are going to replace them in a way that you there's there's no real draw to go back
[6076.96 --> 6084.56]  to lcd where there is a draw to go back to crt um so i think lcd's death will be a little bit more
[6084.56 --> 6094.48]  permanent oh i think that's fair what would it what would it take for you to use windows on arm
[6094.48 --> 6102.00]  microsoft just unveiled their mini an arm desktop called project volterra um it was at this year's
[6102.00 --> 6106.48]  build 2022 conference this was actually from last week but we didn't get to it and i wanted to talk
[6106.48 --> 6113.52]  about it it looks kind of like a headless surface studio here let's pull up my screen here blah blah
[6113.52 --> 6119.36]  blah blah blah blah let's find the point in the video where they show it um it was developed in partnership
[6119.36 --> 6125.04]  with qualcomm so it's going to be using snapdragon silicon which up until now has proven to be
[6126.24 --> 6133.84]  basically a big part of the reason that windows on arm is not very successful uh where the bloody
[6133.84 --> 6138.72]  i just wouldn't dude i at this point i'm honestly like kind of barely holding on to using windows at all
[6140.48 --> 6148.40]  like the the linux challenge like really revealed to me that like it's not there but it's not that far
[6149.36 --> 6155.76]  you know and like taking a worse version of windows is not really an option right now um
[6156.72 --> 6161.12]  yeah it's everything you hate about windows with everything that you hate about windows
[6161.12 --> 6164.72]  yeah got it yep yeah i'm not even remotely interested
[6167.44 --> 6172.40]  that's pretty much it yeah all right that's fair enough and i think that's pretty much it for the show
[6173.20 --> 6178.88]  thank you guys so much for tuning in if you made it this far hey don't forget we just
[6178.88 --> 6185.68]  launched the lanyard black and orange version of the lanyard and we have our summer sweat promotion
[6185.68 --> 6190.40]  running right now it's by a swacket and a beanie together just add them to your cart
[6190.40 --> 6198.72]  and you get 20 bucks off and you will be ready for the fall in june otherwise we'll still have
[6198.72 --> 6204.80]  swackets in the fall probably so it should be fine we'll be as cheap though see you next week same bad
