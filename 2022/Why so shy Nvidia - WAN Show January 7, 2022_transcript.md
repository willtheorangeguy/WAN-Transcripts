[0.00 --> 6.72]  at twitch and float plane chat and welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a
[6.72 --> 13.44]  fantastic show lined up for you guys today man was there ever a lot of tech news i mean it's ces
[13.44 --> 20.08]  right sort of have you seen any things that are remotely interesting have you seen any pictures
[20.08 --> 26.12]  from like the show i've seen yo just like not very many things there or people yeah it's it's
[26.12 --> 30.84]  pretty dead it's pretty dead there's not a lot of not a lot of people there uh but definitely a lot
[30.84 --> 40.28]  of news you got your wi-fi 6 release 2 yes yeah yes i was waiting for that we're gonna talk about
[40.28 --> 49.48]  that the second version of it also we've got intel just freaking deciding to be doing lots of stuff
[49.48 --> 54.36]  they fell asleep for like a decade and now they're waking up just what's going on they're flailing
[54.36 --> 59.56]  they're swinging yeah in every direction you better watch it you could get your jaw broke you
[59.56 --> 70.52]  make gpus what else we got today uh nvidia is is really really shy about its rtx 3090 ti why so
[70.52 --> 81.16]  shy nvidia hi i don't even want never say that again on this show they clarified again never say it okay
[81.16 --> 84.84]  never say you know how many people take it seriously when i say stuff like that to you guys
[85.40 --> 94.20]  we're just i just want to clarify okay when i went on like oh man yeah like it's it's on it's insulting
[94.20 --> 99.96]  on so many levels on the one hand it's insulting that people think that i'm actually just a giant
[101.16 --> 109.24]  and on the other hand it's insulting that they think i'm stupid enough to show that publicly if i was
[109.24 --> 116.52]  such a gigantic in recorded format exactly right yeah never say those words on this show i'm so
[116.52 --> 126.44]  sorry i'm joking and he's not sorry either he's gonna do it again yeah what else we got i mean
[126.44 --> 131.64]  there's a few other things that happened to the show like a color changing phone and a color changing
[131.64 --> 138.68]  car but um okay the color change car is pretty cool yeah but it's not in the dog i grabbed an article so we
[138.68 --> 144.12]  can share it anyways so i think it's pretty cool it is pretty cool but uh yeah color changing car
[144.12 --> 148.12]  we'll just do it let's roll that intro it's gonna be a real formal show it's all about the ties
[151.80 --> 156.84]  oh my goodness
[161.00 --> 167.48]  floatplane chat i hate you so much what why ohmgy wise line is telling luke what to say this is like way too far
[168.68 --> 178.12]  enough enough enough enough sponsors squarespace mint mobile no way mint mobile is a sponsor yeah
[178.12 --> 185.40]  not like ryan reynolds thing i think so and fresh books too all right cool um i i i am officially i'm
[185.40 --> 194.44]  officially you know sponsored by my fellow vancouver holy crap uh do you want to curate some merch
[194.44 --> 201.40]  messages real quick because they are flying in today whoa okay yeah i'm on it people figured out
[201.40 --> 207.96]  that we launched something today um why don't i talk through the nvidia stuff or show it off that's our
[207.96 --> 213.08]  oh i i mean i guess i could do that it's a little early in the show to just be is it they don't think
[213.08 --> 219.72]  so okay all right i'll show the merch one second we just launched the wants the wan pants okay they're
[219.72 --> 225.24]  like a jogger slash sweatpants kind of thing hey luke's rocking them too they got the orange accents
[226.20 --> 231.32]  actually yeah that's pretty good they got the uh they got the waterproof zipper i mean they're
[231.32 --> 235.72]  they're sweatpants so like there's nothing else waterproof about the garment we were just like
[235.72 --> 242.12]  hey waterproof zippers are sick so yeah i'm gonna put a ykk waterproof zipper on the butt i like that all
[242.12 --> 247.56]  the pockets zip up because i find stuff falls out of sweatpants pockets way too easy i have lost two
[247.56 --> 252.68]  pairs of air pods pros because of sweatpants that don't have zippers on the pocket so that was
[252.68 --> 257.24]  something that i specifically asked for on these yeah that's huge for me like that's actually that's
[257.24 --> 264.76]  massive and then i actually finally have a response to what the back pocket is for okay so aside from the
[264.76 --> 273.32]  obvious joke that it's for your condoms because you're not having any sex um it's for your earphones
[277.56 --> 283.40]  yeah okay and it actually like doesn't interfere with where your butt sits like in the chair yeah
[283.40 --> 288.28]  that makes sense yeah yeah so uh so there you go it's got a little zipper pocket in the back for your
[288.28 --> 296.36]  earphones good stuff all right let's talk about nvidia nvidia tries its best and this is where the
[296.36 --> 302.84]  headline why are you so shy in video why are you so shy comes from they try their best not to talk about
[302.84 --> 316.36]  the rtx 3090 ti don't even do it it's officially tie okay and confirmed the rtx 3050 so they unveiled
[316.36 --> 326.20]  their most powerful gpu ever at ces on tuesday but they talked about it for just 25 seconds out of
[326.20 --> 333.00]  their 48 and a half minute presentation which was enough for us to find out the following it's got
[333.00 --> 343.80]  40 shader teraflops 78 rage racing teraflops 320 tensor teraflops 24 gigs of gddr6x memory at 21 gigabit per
[343.80 --> 354.68]  second and then rumors further suggest 10 752 coup de course 15 60 megahertz base 18 60 megahertz boost clocks
[354.68 --> 361.16]  and over one terabyte per second of memory bandwidth that's right they have cracked the
[361.16 --> 370.28]  terabyte per second memory bandwidth barrier allegedly it's asking for 450 watts via either a pcie gen 5 16
[370.28 --> 380.84]  pin 12 volt connector or 2 12 pin nvidia ones and has an msrp supposedly of 16.99 us dollars the other thing
[380.84 --> 387.08]  that is not rumor but that they officially confirmed is that it is pronounced tie they are in fact
[387.08 --> 394.60]  incorrect yes that's right i said it nvidia is not correct about the name of their own product because
[394.60 --> 406.84]  nobody ever ever pronounced okay the periodic element titanium tie nobody ever did that it is short for
[406.84 --> 418.36]  titanium and nobody shortens titanium to tie ti also just sounds way cooler it does 3080 tie sounds lame
[419.56 --> 429.64]  weak not good it's 80 ti sounds great it does and it's like it's like i'm sorry you know i i know this
[429.64 --> 432.92]  is going to be one of those things where there's going to be someone on twitter who goes
[432.92 --> 439.48]  linus's linus's arrogance on full display again imagine telling a company that they're wrong about
[439.48 --> 447.48]  the name of their product but you got to understand ti is not a thing that nvidia like invented they did
[447.48 --> 454.04]  not create the periodic table of the elements they did they did they named their titanium card like
[455.24 --> 460.12]  how long ago was that like 20 years ago they had the first ti suffix card or something like that i can't
[460.12 --> 466.68]  remember exactly how long ago it was it was about that though and it was clearly titanium so why the
[466.68 --> 478.44]  retcon i don't i don't get it you can't you can't just change the story so i'm angry i'm angry and uh
[478.44 --> 483.00]  that's uh that's all i had to say about the majority of the they didn't really talk about this graphics card
[483.00 --> 490.28]  topic was just being angry about the pronunciation of tai well it's just unnecessary you know like why
[491.80 --> 498.04]  uh i will i will point out that that that they always want it called tai but i will never
[498.04 --> 506.52]  consistently they do not always want it called tai that is a new thing when they launched like 560 ti
[506.52 --> 513.32]  yeah it was not tai was it really no do you have like an actual clip of them saying ti for that
[513.32 --> 519.72]  oh lots of that that would be very interesting more than half the people i know at nvidia call it ti
[519.72 --> 524.28]  yeah like if you're just on a conference call with them yeah almost actually now that i think about it
[524.28 --> 530.20]  almost everyone i've ever talked to at nvidia everyone i know what nvidia says ti they say ti because it
[530.20 --> 540.84]  obviously is yeah it's just so stupid i wonder if this is a weird thing where it's like actually a um
[540.84 --> 547.32]  where it's some kind of like trademark battle and they just can't publicly acknowledge it like i know
[547.32 --> 554.12]  amd i can't remember what product it was but they had a super cool name for a product and they ended up
[554.12 --> 560.20]  getting into some kind of dispute with like a football team over it because the football team
[560.20 --> 567.88]  had trademarked this term in like digital media in the digital media space and technically gaming
[568.44 --> 574.76]  was kind of under the umbrella of digital media so even though the odds of this football team ever
[574.76 --> 579.64]  having any kind of conflicting product that could actually be confused for i don't even remember if
[579.64 --> 583.80]  it was a gpu or cpu to be honest with you but the odds of them ever having a conflicting
[583.80 --> 591.32]  product that could be confused is functionally zero yeah but in order to avoid any kind of future
[591.32 --> 598.36]  dispute over it they ended up going with a completely different stupider name for it um and so what what i
[598.36 --> 605.08]  actually kind of wonder is it could be is if it's if it's an issue um someone's suggesting that it could
[605.08 --> 613.00]  be an issue with texas instruments um does anyone call them ti ti 83 yeah
[613.88 --> 617.88]  maybe that's the issue people definitely abbreviate that as ti for sure
[619.56 --> 624.12]  like ti 83 t 84 plus i think they've they've pretty much always and i think literally in the
[624.12 --> 629.64]  product name at the top of the calculator it says ti doesn't it uh yeah yeah it does yeah so in the
[629.64 --> 635.80]  product name it has ti that's pretty interesting so it could be um so then okay fine maybe maybe i
[635.80 --> 642.12]  acknowledge that this is something maybe nvidia has to do i mean they also just don't have to have
[642.92 --> 648.68]  ti in the product names at all they have lots of suffixes they've used ultra you know what i'd love to
[648.68 --> 656.92]  see them return to okay you know how gtx went from being a suffix to being a prefix and then it was
[656.92 --> 662.92]  superseded by rtx okay hear me out the rtx 3090 gtx
[662.92 --> 672.44]  just just hug it i mean if they're just gonna make up the rules as they go along anyway then who
[672.44 --> 680.52]  cares just throw out the rule book i i would have this doesn't matter at all i wish they kept gtx in
[680.52 --> 694.44]  the front and made rtx just an r at the end rtx just an r wait gtx gtx 3080r um that's cool make the r
[694.44 --> 702.68]  red yeah make it red yeah i think red ain't happening at nvidia anytime soon ladies and gentlemen yeah
[704.04 --> 707.64]  you know that's uh oh man we're gonna have to talk about the stuff that launched at ces at some point
[707.64 --> 714.68]  but that kind of that kind of makes me made me think how many people remember okay you know how
[714.68 --> 720.20]  in the tech space you got team blue who's team blue intel okay who's team green nvidia okay who's
[720.20 --> 729.88]  team red amd okay how many people remember that amd used to be green like is it just me or is the color
[729.88 --> 734.76]  red the most important thing they got out of the ati acquisition i think it kind of is because yeah i i
[734.76 --> 741.00]  the old amd logo was was green and black right yeah yeah essentially the same as nvidia um but
[741.00 --> 745.40]  everyone calls them team red which is great yeah i love that i love that just like i
[746.60 --> 753.48]  speaking of retcons right it's like no no no we're team red we were red all um um uh don't worry about
[753.48 --> 758.84]  that i just i just get a kick out of it um okay we got to talk about some other nvidia stuff
[758.84 --> 767.16]  uh the wisdom of launching an rtx 3090 ti with a ga 102 is sort of questionable considering the same
[767.16 --> 774.68]  dpu die is being used for the already unobtainium rtx 3080 3080 ti and 3090 which is probably a big
[774.68 --> 778.76]  part of the reason why they kind of glossed over it at the presentation yeah that's probably gonna be a
[778.76 --> 783.16]  nothing burger even if they have additional fab capacity lined up people probably won't be happy
[783.16 --> 788.84]  because i think we like i don't think there just is any uh the rtx 3050 on the other hand is a much
[788.84 --> 797.24]  easier sell with the only question being where was the rtx 3050 six months ago um it'll have eight
[797.24 --> 802.20]  gigs of gddr6 memory nine shader teraflops blah blah blah tensor something something where's the
[802.20 --> 807.40]  cuda core count okay i don't see it here but it's geared towards gtx 1050 owners and really anyone
[807.40 --> 814.36]  looking for 60 fps 1080p gameplay uh you won't be able to run this card with rtx on or sorry you
[814.36 --> 820.76]  won't want to run this card with rtx on since it's already a struggle on existing low-end cards and
[820.76 --> 832.04]  nvidia admits that it will require dlss to reach 60 fps at 1080p but i am excited to see anything anything
[832.04 --> 838.04]  that is actually at an affordable price point because as soon as people have something that
[838.04 --> 847.72]  they can buy for 250 theoretically okay msrp 249 january 27th availability there's a there's a just to
[847.72 --> 852.44]  interrupt you for a second there's a super chat that i want to i want to go through right now it says and
[852.44 --> 858.52]  i'm quoting this perfectly oh my god linus is showing his arrogance once again trying to tell nvidia how
[858.52 --> 869.48]  their product name is pronounced honestly i don't make the rules okay that's how it's pronounced
[872.60 --> 880.36]  no one ever pronounced an element by just saying it like that the first two letters of the word yeah
[880.36 --> 886.12]  exactly no one ever called chlorine club okay nobody ever called bromine bruh
[886.12 --> 896.12]  bro okay they should they should they should they should let's bro mean bruh aluminum is not al oh
[897.24 --> 901.48]  okay zinc can we stop
[904.20 --> 913.16]  i swear i'm done i'm done talking about it so 30 50 as soon as you can buy something modern okay for 250
[913.16 --> 924.28]  dollars that basically invalidates anything under you know 150 for older obsolete gpus as soon as
[924.28 --> 928.84]  those start to come down in price it's it's a it's a waterfall effect and that's what's really
[928.84 --> 935.80]  frustrating about all of this is nvidia and amd know that they could have delivered these lower end gpus
[935.80 --> 940.36]  earlier if they had really wanted to and they had justification to not do so because they couldn't
[940.36 --> 946.84]  make enough of the higher margin ones anyway so why would they introduce new products but that didn't
[946.84 --> 953.32]  stop them from introducing new products and if we're from a from a gamer perspective gamers don't
[953.32 --> 958.36]  necessarily need the highest possible density they don't need higher performance density that's
[958.36 --> 964.84]  something that benefits miners for whom there is an actual cost per slot and the they want that sweet
[964.84 --> 971.96]  spot of power to however many hashes per second it'll run um to populate a slot with so producing
[971.96 --> 979.32]  low-end cards is actually beneficial primarily for gamers who only need one card to occupy one slot so
[979.32 --> 984.84]  if you can take a silicon wafer and you can slice it up into more pieces the odds that they will end up in
[984.84 --> 991.72]  the hands of gamers become greater so you know i'm frustrated it didn't happen earlier but here it is now i
[991.72 --> 996.20]  don't know who we have to thank for this did amd pull the trigger first causing nvidia to be like
[996.20 --> 1001.08]  we should probably do this is it pressure from intel that is causing both amd and nvidia to sit
[1001.08 --> 1006.76]  up and pay attention i don't know but uh thank you very much nvidia for finally doing what we all needed
[1006.76 --> 1015.64]  you to do a long time ago um and i look forward to doing some budget builds for a change yes it's been a
[1015.64 --> 1021.96]  long time since we've been able to fire up a stream to be like hey let's build a practical gaming rig
[1021.96 --> 1028.68]  that makes any sense at a price that is palatable and i'm jazzed i'm jazzed i hope it actually freaking
[1028.68 --> 1034.92]  happens me too uh why don't we move on to our next topic for the day what do you want to do next
[1034.92 --> 1039.08]  uh i think i'm kind of relegated to merch messages duty have you taken a look
[1039.08 --> 1053.96]  at all holy crap balls i'm working on it i'm trying um holy crap uh okay uh there's some news
[1053.96 --> 1057.96]  actually okay here why don't i do merch messages for a bit okay yeah i've got some i've got some cool
[1057.96 --> 1063.08]  news uh there's a new uh there's actually a few new full plane features most of them are streaming
[1063.08 --> 1069.32]  related most of them are back end for streaming related stuff um so it's just better hooray um
[1069.32 --> 1074.36]  but also there's a cool new feature that ltt is gonna have to start using so i'm gonna have to do
[1074.36 --> 1077.80]  an educational thing i'll probably send an email out over the weekend or something so that people are
[1077.80 --> 1082.92]  ready for it next week but there's now a tagging system people have been asking for this for a while
[1082.92 --> 1089.48]  once we stopped doing early access on floatplane for ltt exclusives started taking more of a main stage
[1089.48 --> 1095.32]  and there hasn't been a way to look for them specifically yes there is um so there's a tagging
[1095.32 --> 1102.60]  system specifically for videos that are out that is out now it's not uh the absolute coolest thing ever
[1103.32 --> 1109.16]  because wow what a sales pitch you can search for it and and the creator can tag it chief technology
[1109.16 --> 1117.16]  officer floatplane media but it's not the greatest thing but the really cool version is coming down the
[1117.16 --> 1123.56]  line where channels on floatplane will have sub channels so there will be a sub channel for tech
[1123.56 --> 1129.24]  quickie for tech linked for everything um and exclusives will be able to have a sub channel there
[1129.24 --> 1136.20]  that will make it very very easy um to sort and see through things in the short term though there is
[1136.20 --> 1141.48]  this exclusive tagging thing so you can either click on the tag or you can search hashtag exclusives
[1141.48 --> 1149.64]  um or honestly whatever you guys want to call it cool um and then and then yeah that's good also new
[1149.64 --> 1154.60]  creator on floatplane uh there's new creator this week there's also probably going to be a new creator
[1154.60 --> 1159.96]  next week um but the new creator that's that i'm talking about this week is garbage time also known as
[1159.96 --> 1167.00]  dank pods if you've watched that on on uh on the youtubes he's doing some actually really cool music streams
[1167.00 --> 1171.96]  where he plays mostly like meme songs and then he drums along with it he uh he used to be a
[1171.96 --> 1176.12]  professional gigging musician he's very good it's actually been really entertaining to watch those
[1176.12 --> 1181.08]  so check it out if you're interested um there's probably a lot of people in the chat that have
[1181.08 --> 1188.20]  heard of dank pods because uh yeah he's pretty awesome uh the chat's exploding yeah yeah pretty much
[1188.20 --> 1192.36]  he's great i've had a bunch of conversations with him he's actually like a genuinely just like really
[1192.36 --> 1199.32]  cool and wholesome dude and i'm stoked to have him on the platform so yeah um this is insane i can
[1199.32 --> 1203.16]  barely stay on top of it that's yeah that's what i was doing the whole time you're doing the nvidia
[1203.16 --> 1211.32]  conversation okay so yeah anyways also probably new creator joining next week uh and and yeah things
[1211.32 --> 1218.76]  are good all right cool why don't we jump into our next topic of the day intel is a contender again
[1218.76 --> 1227.72]  they've got their arc gpus they've got the 12 900 ks and more uh but so they're already shipping their
[1227.72 --> 1234.36]  gpus to oems which means we're going to see them integrated into add-in boards as well as laptops
[1235.00 --> 1242.44]  50 designs expected in q1 pretty awesome uh one quick thing to add about the dank pods thing
[1242.44 --> 1246.84]  flowplane has really good audio quality that is actually a big benefit it's a music stream
[1246.84 --> 1254.04]  it sounds great so if you're into that that's the thing sorry keep going uh all right cool i'm gonna
[1254.04 --> 1260.52]  keep i'm gonna keep talking now uh arc alchemist is built on tsmc's n6 process which is currently
[1260.52 --> 1266.04]  relatively clear of gpus that's honestly in my opinion the most exciting thing about this we're
[1266.04 --> 1272.60]  expecting arc alchemist to be a relatively mainstream tier gpu and again that's what i'm talking about
[1272.60 --> 1278.84]  i'm talking about sheer quantity of gpus that's how you drive down the demand which is how you
[1278.84 --> 1284.52]  drive down the prices you get gpus in the hands of gamers who need them to play games um so it's
[1284.52 --> 1290.92]  built on the n6 process which is completely untapped for gpus at this time so this is net new capacity
[1291.80 --> 1296.76]  the new gpus will be able to work in tandem with integrated xc graphics to split up workloads such as
[1296.76 --> 1301.56]  intel's example of exporting video and davinci resolve accelerating the process by 40 percent they
[1301.56 --> 1307.00]  weren't done with high-end 12th gen core though they've got a new 12 900k sq and you know what i
[1307.00 --> 1313.96]  love most about the ks okay this is a binned 12 900k that can do 5.5 gigahertz single core and over
[1313.96 --> 1320.36]  five gigahertz all core boost out of the freaking box it's cool but this is obviously something that
[1320.36 --> 1326.28]  intel wouldn't have bothered to do if they didn't feel like they had to isn't competition wonderful
[1326.28 --> 1334.04]  ladies and gentlemen good um we don't know exactly what to expect in terms of performance from amd's
[1334.04 --> 1341.48]  ryzen 7 5800 x3d but they claimed that it will be the world's fastest gaming processor that it is
[1341.48 --> 1346.60]  due out this spring and clearly those claims are credible enough sounding that intel felt the need to
[1346.60 --> 1356.28]  respond i love this i mean gp if gpus hadn't been such an absolute show over the last couple of years
[1356.28 --> 1361.40]  this would have actually been one of the most exciting periods in tech absolutely yeah in recent
[1361.40 --> 1368.04]  memory if gpus were purchasable yeah that's that's it yeah that's it it would be amazing that's it i mean
[1368.04 --> 1373.08]  and there would be games that would actually push the hardware and like it would have been an amazing
[1373.08 --> 1377.24]  yeah yeah would have been great okay we got to talk about that a little bit later i know what
[1377.24 --> 1381.96]  you're referring to is halo infinite and i've got something really cool to show you that is sort of
[1381.96 --> 1386.68]  halo infinite related just remind me later it's that thing that i was pointing to over in my bag over
[1386.68 --> 1393.56]  there um so super excited for the ks not that excited for pricing that's one thing that has happened
[1393.56 --> 1400.20]  in the cpu space is as intel and amd are absolutely pushing the limits of what they can build
[1400.20 --> 1406.12]  and what they can bin for uh i we're definitely seeing prices creep up a little bit amd's also
[1406.12 --> 1413.80]  got the swagger to actually price their products you know expensively now um i've seen some sort of
[1413.80 --> 1422.60]  controversy even around amd's decision to make their their 3d vcash exclusive to the 5800 tier rather
[1422.60 --> 1429.88]  than doing a 5600 i think that's an example of amd optimizing for business rather than necessarily for
[1429.88 --> 1436.52]  the consumer i think it's a fair enough criticism but i also am a big enough fan of the 5800x that it
[1436.52 --> 1442.36]  doesn't really bother me that much to be honest with you i think that if you are serious about gaming
[1442.36 --> 1453.00]  not just today but tomorrow the 5800x is a really i i think it is worth the extra layout that's that's
[1453.00 --> 1458.84]  that's basically what i'll what i'll say about it don't feel bad if you go with the 5600x and to be
[1458.84 --> 1467.40]  clear am4 dead platform and if anything if i was buying into am4 today i would probably cheap out
[1468.28 --> 1475.80]  i'd probably go ryzen 3000 okay and i would just and i would just i'd wait it out i'd go ryzen 3000 today
[1476.44 --> 1482.60]  and then i'd sit i'd wait for later on this year when am5 is supposed to come out with support for ddr5
[1482.60 --> 1491.00]  with zen4 with all all this all this hyper exciting new tech i'd wait for all those you know rich kids
[1491.00 --> 1499.32]  to go out and buy am5 and then i'd pick up those i'd pick up the you know a 5900x or something even i'd go
[1499.32 --> 1504.44]  i'd go treat myself because i'm basically getting it for a fraction of the price right i mean that was
[1504.44 --> 1511.00]  always my jam when i knew a platform was dead end i was always waiting for i was always waiting to
[1511.00 --> 1515.72]  pounce on it for when the you know the next new theme came out and what's so exciting is that
[1516.36 --> 1522.84]  things are changing so fast things are changing so fast that you can actually like plan ahead to
[1522.84 --> 1528.12]  that degree again i mean there was a time when you would have heard from me i would have said don't
[1528.12 --> 1532.84]  even think about the future just buy whatever's in front of you today because realistically the next
[1532.84 --> 1538.76]  one's not going to be that much better anyway right though it's true it's true it's so frustrating
[1539.88 --> 1545.48]  so really really excited to see how the the heavyweight battle or i guess you could call this
[1545.48 --> 1552.28]  more of like uh like a middleweight middleweight battle uh between the 12900ks and the 5800x3d
[1552.28 --> 1558.04]  turns out we've also got non-k alderlegs qs i mean these are honestly speaking the real game changer
[1558.04 --> 1564.28]  for 12th gen it's great to take back the performance crown you know intel amd nvidia
[1564.28 --> 1569.72]  no matter who you are apple you want the performance crown it's such an important marketing
[1570.44 --> 1575.72]  piece it's one of the reasons that you know tesla never shuts up about their zero to 60 times for
[1575.72 --> 1584.20]  example because even though personally i think the benefit of a tesla is so not the zero to 60 times yeah
[1584.20 --> 1591.08]  it's i mean they have they they have competitive ranges they've got the the the media console
[1591.08 --> 1595.48]  they've got the over the air updates they've got all these other reasons right what was the old car
[1595.48 --> 1601.24]  thing safety it was like podium podium sell cars or something i i it's like why all the car manufacturers
[1601.24 --> 1606.44]  used to be in all the races ah winning races sold cars but i don't remember exactly how they said it
[1606.44 --> 1612.76]  i don't remember it was like horsepower sells cars something and that like torque yeah something
[1612.76 --> 1619.32]  podiums i'm sure someone's gonna correct us but yeah that it's not that important from necessarily
[1619.32 --> 1625.40]  a sales standpoint directly to have the performance crown but it's really important from a marketing
[1625.40 --> 1632.36]  standpoint because if you have the thousand dollar cpu that is the best one there's this perception that
[1632.36 --> 1638.36]  you make great products and if i only have two hundred dollars to spend then i'm gonna get
[1639.48 --> 1644.52]  you know one fifth of that greatness you know like that's that's the customer perception so
[1645.40 --> 1653.56]  uh what is it when on sunday sell on monday uh twitch chat says yeah that was it yeah when sunday
[1653.56 --> 1662.04]  sell monday all right okay got it uh yeah all right cool so right
[1662.68 --> 1668.28]  12th gen though no i mean who's actually spending five six hundred dollars on a cpu
[1669.08 --> 1678.76]  i mean i did that once yeah in the entire time the entire time that i have been a pc gaming enthusiast
[1678.76 --> 1684.36]  which is most of my life which is kind of scary to think about now like actually most of the majority
[1684.36 --> 1695.56]  of my life i spent 700 canadian okay one cpu so that was 550 us or something like that i i spent 700
[1695.56 --> 1703.40]  canadian on a cpu once i kept it fairly long term i kept it long term so i kept it until there was like
[1704.36 --> 1714.20]  uh an ill-kept secret like enthusiast one that you should get instead okay um and then i i flipped the
[1714.20 --> 1718.92]  the like you know the consumer one that everyone knew about for quite a bit and then i actually ended
[1718.92 --> 1722.92]  up saving some money and getting more performance because it's supposed to be overclockable yeah so the
[1722.92 --> 1727.72]  one time i spent that kind of money on a cpu it was a revolutionary chip okay i bought a 4400 plus
[1727.72 --> 1737.00]  4400 plus aphalon x2 4400 plus okay and dual core absolute game changer guys it was double the
[1737.00 --> 1743.96]  performance in certain applications literally double and then aside from that they also amd also had the
[1743.96 --> 1750.28]  best single threaded performance at the time it was zero compromises it had all that cash it was either
[1750.28 --> 1754.04]  a meg of cash or a meg of cash per core i can't i can't remember anymore it's minor details um and then i
[1754.04 --> 1760.36]  didn't get rid of it because it was the king for a long time you could overclock that thing to be
[1760.36 --> 1765.56]  equivalent to the 4800 plus which was like way more expensive way outside my price range at that time
[1766.12 --> 1774.20]  and i didn't upgrade it until i got an optron 165 so the amd's amd was selling their optron server chips
[1774.20 --> 1781.16]  on the desktop socket and you could just like get them and they were they were like supposed to be
[1781.16 --> 1785.08]  more binned or overclockable or something i think that was all nonsense anyway in retrospect
[1785.08 --> 1791.64]  uh but i just i got one of those for cheap and then i sold my 4400 plus for for more so i got like
[1791.64 --> 1797.72]  the same performance or better actually i think my my 165 was actually more overclockable than my 4400 plus
[1797.72 --> 1802.60]  so that was that was the route that i went but that is the only time in my life i ever spent that
[1802.60 --> 1808.84]  kind of money on a cpu and when you look at the difference in performance today with the release of
[1808.84 --> 1816.12]  the rest of intel's 12th gen core lineup you look at the difference between spending 300 or 350 bucks
[1816.12 --> 1823.40]  and spending 600 it is nothing like it was back then yeah yeah like to get a dual core at all at
[1823.40 --> 1829.88]  that time you had to spend that kind of money because they were the cutting edge right even the
[1829.88 --> 1836.92]  cheapest one okay the 4200 plus was only marginally cheaper than the 44 whereas now you can get the vast
[1836.92 --> 1843.24]  majority of the performance for a fraction of the price so you should so as much as i you know as much
[1843.24 --> 1850.12]  as we do a lot of showcase builds core i9s that that's not what most people are buying it's just that
[1850.12 --> 1855.96]  having that having that that that flagship hold the performance crown in some key application or
[1855.96 --> 1861.48]  game be it gaming i mean it's a big one obviously in the consumer space is so important because it means
[1861.48 --> 1866.28]  that regardless of what the real performance numbers are you're going to sell way more of
[1866.28 --> 1872.04]  those lower tier skus so that's what amd and intel and nvidia for that matter are after you know the
[1872.04 --> 1879.72]  most i ever spent on a cpu i think was sub 200 really because of the most intel retail edge programs good
[1879.72 --> 1886.44]  old retail edge yeah i just abused that as much as i could because i'm if i remember correctly i got one
[1886.44 --> 1892.44]  of those off of a friend before i worked there and then once i started working there i got them
[1892.44 --> 1897.48]  and then after i had worked there you know the whole told you that story before
[1900.20 --> 1906.68]  so yeah um that's a thing birch messages are just absolutely still popping off i know
[1907.88 --> 1912.52]  it's crazy i'm trying to stay on top of them a little bit but it's it's really hard there's a
[1912.52 --> 1919.56]  there's a freaking ton of them i can't i can't stay on top of it um okay color changing car let's
[1919.56 --> 1923.24]  talk about the color changing car you're gonna bring this up on your screen because this thing looks
[1923.24 --> 1928.52]  freaking incredible i mean it's something that conceptually i think has been talked about before
[1928.52 --> 1935.24]  but i don't think anyone has ever done anything quite like this yeah it's this is not the gif i don't
[1935.24 --> 1941.32]  know if there's oh you gotta find the heck you gotta find it luke i want to find the gif yeah but it it
[1941.32 --> 1948.76]  it it is able to change colors they they paired up with uh e paper e inks prism e paper they made
[1948.76 --> 1955.72]  essentially displays that go across the the outside of the car and it can change colors here we've got a
[1955.72 --> 1965.96]  video hold on i think i've got the here it is i've got it nice here it is check this out oh yeah there you
[1965.96 --> 1973.96]  go that is so cool so you could basically just be like oh you know what i'm gonna go with the white
[1973.96 --> 1979.48]  car today this has got to be i'm gonna go with the black card today in a heist movie right it's gotta be
[1979.48 --> 1985.56]  oh that's so cool i love that yeah i mean they could even just do it like digitally now they wouldn't
[1985.56 --> 1991.08]  even need a car that actually has the technology built into it right but at least like it's it's
[1991.08 --> 1997.08]  possible yeah yeah now i mean i guess it's technically believable if you see it in a heist
[1997.08 --> 2005.56]  movie now yeah i freaking love it i think it looks really cool or like j q q gets james bond a new car
[2005.56 --> 2011.88]  that's able to like chameleon color itself i do have to wonder you know what something like this
[2011.88 --> 2017.88]  would cost right now this is only a concept car have you ever looked into buying e-ink displays
[2017.88 --> 2026.52]  no they're so expensive really i saw someone did a project where they they curated like various uh
[2026.52 --> 2030.60]  newspaper feeds from around the internet and they would have it show up on an e-ink display in their
[2030.60 --> 2034.36]  bathroom in the morning and i was like that's actually like kind of cool i wonder like what
[2034.36 --> 2037.80]  other projects we could do with e-ink displays and i was thinking about stuff for myself but i was
[2037.80 --> 2042.04]  thinking also thinking like maybe we could do a video about it whatever and then if i remember correctly
[2042.04 --> 2048.68]  a standard monitor sized e-ink display was like thousands of dollars like it was really really
[2048.68 --> 2055.40]  expensive um i would not have expected that i would have thought that they were actually kind of like
[2055.96 --> 2062.44]  cheap-ish let me let me look into it really quick because the only places you really see them deployed
[2062.44 --> 2069.08]  in any kind of volume are like e-readers and those are generally pretty affordable types of devices then
[2069.08 --> 2076.04]  again compared to a cheap tablet that does not use an e-ink display a kobo reader or a kindle is
[2076.04 --> 2082.04]  actually not that cheap now that i think about it for the for the tier of hardware that they have inside
[2082.04 --> 2088.36]  them like the processing power that they have yeah so i guess uh i guess it kind of makes sense i just
[2088.36 --> 2094.36]  it's just one of those things that i never like as a gamer you know like i never really cared about it
[2094.36 --> 2101.16]  it didn't matter to me yeah i i'm finding a lot of conflicting stuff chad is saying that monochrome
[2101.16 --> 2107.80]  is cheap color gets really expensive i also just found an article um that was posted actually like
[2107.80 --> 2117.32]  somewhat recently like it was posted in in in 2021 uh last year last year but it's like a 24-inch monitor
[2117.32 --> 2124.68]  or something 25 inch e-ink display it's 1500 yeah i got your screen here really yeah there's finally
[2125.24 --> 2135.64]  i love the word finally there it's finally a 25 inch for extreme extreme readers yeah i i that's ridiculous
[2135.64 --> 2143.24]  to me yeah i don't know uh uh ajen in the float plane chat says that bmw when it gets a ding from a
[2143.24 --> 2152.44]  grocery car and part of the display shop's working oh brutal because it probably i'm assuming
[2153.48 --> 2158.44]  like back end wise it probably has what what were they called when you were doing your big wall tv
[2159.24 --> 2168.36]  ah the squares oh micro led no no no no like each square was called something oh like a module yeah
[2168.36 --> 2173.88]  i'm assuming it's in modules okay so like you get dinged by a cart in one module just
[2177.16 --> 2182.04]  that'd be unfortunate i have no idea i haven't read into like how it exactly goes on the car or
[2182.04 --> 2187.56]  anything but it's really cool this is probably one of the most like visually interesting things that
[2187.56 --> 2193.08]  happened at the show there's also a phone where the body color of the phone changes when it's exposed
[2193.08 --> 2198.12]  to sunlight i believe i don't know they said the tech took two years to make it's probably highly
[2198.12 --> 2203.24]  related to transitions classes how those work yeah because it's exposed to sunlight for 30 seconds which
[2203.24 --> 2209.32]  is an extremely similar metric to transitions glasses yeah and it's probably a glass back if i'm guessing
[2209.32 --> 2215.88]  yeah that sounds like that probably took two years because it like wasn't a major priority yeah but it's
[2215.88 --> 2221.24]  kind of neat that's yeah that's definitely cool i'd be into that yeah me too so that's kind of cool
[2221.24 --> 2228.60]  there's some cool chameleon color changing things um that that happened at ces and not a ton else
[2229.88 --> 2236.04]  because ces was even worse this year than i think it has ever previously been and that has been quite
[2236.04 --> 2242.92]  the trend i'm so glad i didn't have to go this is two years in a row now i have not had to go to ces
[2242.92 --> 2248.60]  it's been it's been validating seeing like really old media talking about how ces has been getting
[2248.60 --> 2253.00]  worse for the last little while because when we first went i actually thought it was like amazing
[2254.20 --> 2261.40]  and like okay i didn't like las vegas no luke's not a big vegas guy no yep but like the show was
[2261.40 --> 2266.36]  fantastic right and then we're there for quite a while and i'm like okay am i just getting sour like
[2266.36 --> 2272.60]  have i just done this too much and now i don't care anymore but like just too jaded i think yeah i
[2272.60 --> 2277.56]  think the show's just worse i think that's honestly what's happening um because i remember
[2277.56 --> 2282.04]  like the first couple years we were there you could walk around the show floor and just content would
[2282.04 --> 2287.72]  just happen because you'd walk past some booth and you're like yeah that's crazy let's film that and
[2287.72 --> 2295.48]  now it's like well there's 47 000 phone cases and 82 000 vacuums oh man when the when the phone cases
[2295.48 --> 2302.60]  took over yeah that was a bad year it was not cool no not cool man what are some of those what are some
[2302.60 --> 2309.00]  of those phone case companies that were just like enormous they would have these like gigantic booths i
[2309.00 --> 2314.60]  can't even remember anymore because no one cares multiple floors yeah like phone cases are just
[2314.60 --> 2319.64]  commodity at this point yeah um other than dbrand hi dbrand
[2319.64 --> 2326.44]  don't worry they're robots they can't uh they can't understand what you're saying and sponsors
[2326.44 --> 2331.56]  other more different sponsors the show is brought to you today by squarespace squarespace gives you
[2331.56 --> 2335.64]  the tools you need to build and grow your online presence they've got a ton of templates spanning a
[2335.64 --> 2339.72]  large variety of categories so whether you need a website for your blog or your wedding or your
[2339.72 --> 2344.68]  business squarespace has got you covered you can get a domain quickly through squarespace if you need
[2344.68 --> 2348.84]  one or you can port over an existing domain that you already own and you can get started with a
[2348.84 --> 2354.60]  14 day trial by heading to squarespace.com forward slash when and you'll get 10 off your first
[2354.60 --> 2360.60]  purchase so go check them out the show is also brought to you today by mint mobile that's right
[2360.60 --> 2367.64]  if saving more and spending less is one of your goals for 2022 uh why do you keep buying so much
[2367.64 --> 2373.24]  merch at lttstore.com no seriously uh why are you still paying insane amounts of money every month for
[2373.24 --> 2377.96]  wireless switching to mint mobile is one of the easiest ways to save this year as the first company to
[2377.96 --> 2382.12]  sell premium wireless services online only mint mobile lets you maximize your savings with plans
[2382.12 --> 2387.96]  starting at just 15 a month all plans come with unlimited talk and text and high-speed data on the
[2387.96 --> 2393.00]  us's largest 5g network and you can use your own phone with mint mobiles with mint mobile's plans
[2393.00 --> 2397.88]  and keep the same phone number along with all your existing contacts i would think our audience is savvy
[2397.88 --> 2402.52]  enough to know that you can keep your contacts when you when you uh migrate from one carrier to another
[2402.52 --> 2406.52]  but hey that's a good talking point for the normies out there as well thanks ryan to get you
[2408.76 --> 2414.76]  we got you mr reynolds to get your new wireless plan for just 15 a month and get the plan shipped
[2414.76 --> 2418.76]  to your door for free i don't know what plan shipped to your door for free means go to mint
[2418.76 --> 2424.36]  mobile.com slash wancho maybe they mean sim card maybe this is more normie speak to get the plan
[2424.36 --> 2429.00]  shipped to your door um yeah that's right you can cut your mobile bill to 15 bucks a month at
[2429.00 --> 2435.00]  mintmobile.com slash wancho so why don't we just summarize that it's really affordable because
[2435.00 --> 2442.52]  they sell online only there you go i remember from my ncix days actually hold on a second i'm gonna go
[2442.52 --> 2448.28]  back to the wide for a second uh we actually tried to get into being like a mobile carrier reseller and
[2448.28 --> 2455.88]  the commissions on that stuff are crazy if we had ever actually managed to successfully do it um it could
[2455.88 --> 2463.24]  have propped up the retail locations in a big way because you get paid for like some absurd amount of
[2463.24 --> 2471.16]  time like a portion of what that customer is paying per month so it's no great mystery how mint is able
[2471.16 --> 2478.68]  to offer really aggressive plans it's by just cutting out that honestly entirely unnecessary and infuriating
[2478.68 --> 2485.48]  process where you go into a store and fill out a whole crap ton of what feels like completely unnecessary
[2485.48 --> 2491.00]  paperwork when this should just be as simple as here's my name here's the number i want here's
[2491.00 --> 2496.68]  where to send the bill to thanks yeah like why has this process of getting a device registered on a
[2496.68 --> 2502.04]  network been so complicated for so long well i mean i know the answer is because they all want you to
[2502.04 --> 2508.44]  be locked into their devices and blah blah blah blah blah what i just got a fantastic merch message
[2508.44 --> 2513.64]  that face it almost looks like it's curated mr reynolds showed up in our chat or something like no not quite
[2513.64 --> 2521.80]  if he did i would be i'd be i'd be super i'd be super pretty cool yeah um he may or may not be on my
[2521.80 --> 2528.76]  list it's okay sorry sorry uh anyway we should talk about our third sponsor for the show
[2531.80 --> 2536.44]  thank you fresh books for sponsoring today's video fresh books is easy to use accounting software that

[2546.84 --> 2551.08]  use their time tracker to log every minute of billable hours so you don't have to think about it
[2551.08 --> 2556.36]  later i mean what a nightmare that is when you've done some kind of long-term job and you have to go
[2556.36 --> 2562.20]  back and try and figure did i do six and a half hours or was there like a quarter hour today on that day
[2562.20 --> 2568.28]  yeah it's awful so don't do that use fresh books and you can keep everyone on the same page with their

[2583.56 --> 2590.20]  topic uh jake said that it's less painless these days bought a new phone in cash and rogers came and
[2590.20 --> 2596.12]  dropped it off at my door was pretty nice actually okay i've got so many questions about this
[2596.12 --> 2603.80]  you know why why does jake need to be like buying phones in cash yeah uh number two i know for a fact
[2603.80 --> 2612.84]  that um jake has a company phone plan so is this is this your dealer phone jake you know what you know
[2612.84 --> 2618.76]  what it's fine it's fine i don't even we don't have to talk about that uh let's talk instead about wi-fi
[2618.76 --> 2630.04]  seven jk wi-fi six psych release two nice um version four yeah so there's some notes here wi-fi
[2630.04 --> 2634.60]  six adoption has outpaced previous generations i mean that's easier when you just redefine everything
[2634.60 --> 2640.52]  as wi-fi six sorry sorry sorry sorry i'm getting ahead of myself uh wi-fi certified six release two
[2640.52 --> 2648.36]  is the latest certification from the wi-fi alliance it supports uplink multi-user mobile input output
[2648.36 --> 2656.52]  mobile mobile multiple input output so multi-user memo uh which means it'll have like better support
[2656.52 --> 2661.08]  for more wi-fi six devices entering the market because they'll they'll have more of them connected
[2661.08 --> 2667.40]  to ap's at a time and it'll help balance them um supports new low power and sleep mode enhancements
[2667.40 --> 2673.24]  including broadcast target wake time extended sleep mode and dynamic multi-user spatial multiplexing
[2673.24 --> 2680.28]  power save wow sounds honestly that's a lot of words this is that whole thing where like the uh the
[2680.28 --> 2686.92]  the difference between a sufficiently complex science and magic is indistinguishable that honestly is just
[2686.92 --> 2692.04]  wi-fi in general for me some of the stuff it does where it's like yeah okay so i can have like these
[2692.04 --> 2696.92]  spatial streams and this one's like direct and this one's going to bounce off the couch and like hit the
[2696.92 --> 2701.16]  ceiling and go there so i need to make sure i time the transmission so that they're all going to arrive
[2701.16 --> 2707.24]  at the same time like what anyway um release two's features apply across all the supported bands so
[2707.24 --> 2714.52]  that's 2.4 gigahertz 5 gigahertz and 6 gigahertz and wi-fi 6 release 2 is more of an enhancement for wi-fi
[2714.52 --> 2725.32]  6 and wi-fi 6e not a replacement for them so now we've got the usb mess we've got the hdmi mess
[2725.32 --> 2728.28]  yes and we've got the wi-fi mesh
[2731.88 --> 2732.28]  i quit
[2736.20 --> 2740.52]  i've got so many merch messages it probably wouldn't even matter i could just carry the whole show we
[2741.32 --> 2748.04]  yeah it's painful it's it's painful man i i just don't know i don't know what to say like honestly
[2748.04 --> 2753.80]  the hdmi one in particular so if you guys haven't been paying attention hdmi 2.1
[2753.80 --> 2765.64]  oh shoot no it's hdmi 2.1 a now so first they retconned hdmi 2.0 all hdmi 2.0 devices and 2.1
[2765.64 --> 2777.40]  devices became hdmi 2.1 now they've retconned that and they are all hdmi hdmi 2.1 a and then all of what
[2777.40 --> 2786.04]  we previously understood to be the features of 2.0 2.1 and 2.1 a which do actually according to the old
[2786.04 --> 2794.36]  way of thinking have unique features to them all of those are now considered to be optional features
[2794.36 --> 2805.32]  of the new consolidated hdmi 2.1 spec this clearly serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever other than
[2805.32 --> 2816.36]  to help unscrupulous manufacturers deceive consumers that is the literal only possible reason that this
[2816.36 --> 2824.12]  can exist that's it and the craziest part is it's at the point where i've had manufacturers that don't
[2824.12 --> 2828.36]  like this reach out to me and go do you know anything about this like are we seriously gonna
[2828.36 --> 2840.84]  have to certify hdmi 2.0 ports as hdmi 2.1 a but only supporting 18 gigabit per second transfer rates so
[2840.84 --> 2845.88]  they can't do 4k 120 like is that is that actually how this would you know do you have any idea what's
[2845.88 --> 2853.48]  going on right now and to give you an idea of why this is why this is so stupid you know there's
[2853.48 --> 2860.12]  devices where it might not be that meaningful okay so something like an xbox series x right
[2861.40 --> 2866.44]  in terms of the understood functionality i think that's this is a gaming device where i think people
[2866.44 --> 2870.36]  are going to look at the spec sheet they're going to go okay it supports 4k 120
[2870.84 --> 2876.84]  or does it do 8k 60 i can't remember it doesn't matter the point is it does 4k 120 right and so
[2876.84 --> 2884.60]  they're going to know to look for that but let's take something like uh an apple macbook m1 the macbook
[2884.60 --> 2892.92]  m1 is only hdmi 2.0 which was a point of contention with the computer community as a whole because they
[2892.92 --> 2898.92]  were like oh hey that's actually not very future proof in terms of connecting external high resolution
[2898.92 --> 2904.84]  displays to this thing that actually kind of bites and so now all of a sudden when apple refreshes the
[2904.84 --> 2911.88]  m1 macbook even if they don't update that hdmi port to support greater bandwidth it will still
[2911.88 --> 2922.76]  now magically be the macbook with hdmi 2.1a it's going to be so confusing i mean it was already confusing
[2922.76 --> 2930.04]  enough right when you had when you had hdmi ports that only did 4k 30 hertz right yeah back during
[2930.04 --> 2936.28]  the transition from 1.4 to 2.0 it was really rough yeah it was really rough you had to you had to
[2936.28 --> 2941.64]  really dig into the spec sheet or even ask the manufacturer something hey is this 1.4 or 2.0 well
[2941.64 --> 2948.68]  now there there doesn't even exist terminology to properly find out what's going on okay okay there
[2948.68 --> 2954.60]  does but i can't even remember what it is i read an article about it the other day it's it's it's
[2954.60 --> 2960.60]  some it's some type of of signal encoding that you have to ask if it supports so that you'll know if
[2960.60 --> 2965.72]  it'll do up to 48 gigabit per second and the craziest part is you can even have devices that support
[2965.72 --> 2971.88]  that type of signal encoding like uh lg had their uh oh shoot what generation was it was there this
[2972.44 --> 2977.32]  the one series or the x series i think it's the one series but they had a generation of tvs that
[2977.32 --> 2985.32]  didn't support the full maximum bandwidth of hdmi 2.1 even though it supported most of it i just
[2986.28 --> 2994.52]  i can't fathom how we think that moving backwards and making spec names not mean anything is helpful
[2994.52 --> 3002.84]  in any way whatsoever i'm sorry i'm getting a little i'm getting a little passionate here well it's i mean
[3002.84 --> 3007.24]  i i'm pretty sure we've actually been talking about this type of like naming scheme problem on
[3007.24 --> 3015.24]  wancho since wancho started so what you're saying is it's not getting better no it's potentially
[3015.24 --> 3021.80]  getting worse i don't know this this last year has felt really bad because of the big three that you
[3021.80 --> 3027.16]  just talked about um i feel like it was actually maybe getting a little bit better in kind of the
[3027.16 --> 3031.48]  middle there but recently it's been really taking a taking a downturn
[3031.48 --> 3038.52]  well all right what do you want to talk about next potentially merch messages
[3040.20 --> 3049.16]  um i mean i guess we could do that sure destroyer samuel says displayport for the win yeah displayport
[3049.80 --> 3055.64]  is our it's holding out our last yeah our last hope yeah our last hope
[3055.64 --> 3064.52]  all right um yeah let's do some let's do some merch messages go to the curated section
[3064.52 --> 3070.84]  and you keep managing the incoming ones going with incoming okay this is insane yeah uh all right lauren
[3070.84 --> 3075.32]  hey linus i'm a middle school technology teacher i teach coding robotics 3d printing and computer
[3075.32 --> 3081.24]  applications in your opinion what do middle schoolers need to learn about computers coding applications
[3081.24 --> 3090.04]  hardware oh man so this it could be so much of a deeper conversation um i could man i could i could
[3090.04 --> 3097.64]  talk about this one for hours but personally i think that we should do a lot more to streamline
[3098.20 --> 3103.96]  learning at the secondary school level i think that here in i'm assuming that you're in north america
[3103.96 --> 3109.80]  with me you might not be but some countries already do this yeah but i do think that students should be
[3109.80 --> 3114.52]  sorted based on aptitude and desire of course i mean these are choices we shouldn't just be making
[3114.52 --> 3119.80]  them for people but students should be sorted based on aptitude and desire and a little bit more focused
[3119.80 --> 3127.24]  the cold hard truth is not everybody needs to know how to calculate the molar mass of some chemical that
[3127.24 --> 3135.00]  gets combined in a reaction with some other chemical and what it makes i have never never needed to
[3135.00 --> 3141.24]  know that in my adult life me neither and if i did i'd look it up you would look it up and or you would
[3141.24 --> 3146.20]  just find a guide or a calculator or whatever the case may be so there's a lot of stuff and i'm i'm not
[3146.20 --> 3149.96]  saying that i don't appreciate the education i got there's a lot of stuff that i did learn
[3151.24 --> 3157.16]  i mean even even like that that gives me the background that i need to understand an article that
[3157.16 --> 3163.64]  i'm reading about something that might not even be directly related like it's it's super valuable but i think for
[3163.64 --> 3170.84]  the vast majority of the population that will not come up even once between the day they turn 18 and
[3170.84 --> 3177.56]  reach adulthood and the day they turn 88 and die like it just it is very unlikely and there's something
[3177.56 --> 3184.68]  to be said about being able to kind of graze across a bunch of topics yeah but i think there's a different
[3184.68 --> 3189.64]  way to do it i i do think there's a different way to do it and i think that there's a lot of stuff that i
[3189.64 --> 3194.20]  didn't learn in school that i'm really frustrated that i didn't and i think honestly i think a big
[3194.20 --> 3199.56]  part of the problem uh jake's talking about how to do their taxes um heck yeah i think a big part of
[3199.56 --> 3208.28]  the problem is that teachers and educators more generally have a bit of a bias towards education
[3208.28 --> 3214.68]  pure education for the sake of education and so i think that because these are people who spent their
[3214.68 --> 3220.68]  lives learning molar masses or learning how to calculate and draw out all the different forces
[3220.68 --> 3225.40]  interacting on an object or whatever the case may be i think because they spend their lives pursuing
[3225.40 --> 3232.84]  that type of knowledge um and they don't necessarily and they didn't necessarily become experts on things
[3232.84 --> 3240.04]  like personal tax planning those types of topics fun basically functionally do not get covered
[3240.04 --> 3248.84]  at least here in bc canada 20 years ago when i was actually in school so take this for the outdated
[3248.84 --> 3257.80]  and region specific rant that it is but um i think that long story short coming back to your question
[3257.80 --> 3263.64]  it really depends on what they want to do with their life because asking like okay not everyone needs to
[3263.64 --> 3271.24]  learn how to code yeah and you can code you can be a great programmer and basically not give two hoots
[3271.24 --> 3278.12]  about the hardware side you have to kind of understand how a computer works but i mean they have
[3278.12 --> 3286.20]  hardware engineers for that like that's what that's what those guys do they they they and the firmware folks
[3286.20 --> 3292.36]  will create the you know the api that your program will interact with and it ain't your problem
[3292.36 --> 3296.36]  and the better you understand how the hardware works maybe the the more of a superstar programmer
[3296.36 --> 3301.24]  you can become at the same time if you're wanting to become some form of engineer like a certain
[3301.24 --> 3304.92]  level of understanding about development is probably going to be good but that's a different that's a
[3304.92 --> 3309.24]  different type and level of learning than someone who wants to become like a software engineer a
[3309.24 --> 3313.64]  computer scientist would would undergo and then you ask about applications i would say that if you want
[3313.64 --> 3320.12]  to get into media production for example or you want to get into uh the film industry you should focus 100
[3320.12 --> 3325.64]  of your time on applications and you don't need to know basically anything other than you know i mean
[3325.64 --> 3330.68]  i think a little bit of knowledge of scripting would probably be valuable you know on the coding side
[3330.68 --> 3337.08]  um you know being able to recognize that you know you know this kind of configuration is more optimal
[3337.08 --> 3342.52]  for running my application than this other kind of configuration but you should spend pretty much all
[3342.52 --> 3347.88]  of your time mastering the tools that you're actually going to use for your job so that's the the short answer is
[3347.88 --> 3355.80]  it really is student dependent um by the way your job sounds super cool i always thought it was
[3355.80 --> 3364.20]  interesting like i i had this home ec class that i had to take um and it was it was sewing cooking
[3367.96 --> 3375.48]  i feel like there was something else drama art art okay maybe we had two of those we had one where
[3375.48 --> 3380.84]  you did like drama wood shop and something else and we had one where you did art sewing and cooking
[3380.84 --> 3385.72]  yeah we had we had we had sewing cooking and i think maybe art and then we had woodwork metal work
[3385.72 --> 3390.44]  and shop and i really liked the idea of doing the woodwork metal work and shop one and i think
[3390.44 --> 3395.96]  electronics was in that as well but the other one i was like you know what i got nothing against them
[3395.96 --> 3403.24]  there's no way i'm gonna grow up to be someone who sews things i'm like he knows who he is okay
[3403.24 --> 3409.48]  ladies and gentlemen yes like i i that was probably one of the lowest grades man knows himself i was
[3409.48 --> 3414.12]  really bad at it even when i was trying and i had to try at least a little bit because i would have
[3414.12 --> 3420.20]  failed like it was a problem um the the cooking one i was like okay i can cook what i need to cook
[3420.20 --> 3425.96]  yeah i'm not going to become a chef i actually really like cooking but i don't think working in
[3425.96 --> 3431.24]  a kitchen would be my thing so whatever like i knew all of this when i was in grade eight when they made
[3431.24 --> 3438.04]  me take the course i remember thinking in grade eight like i know this this isn't a question this
[3438.04 --> 3443.88]  isn't a possibility i'm going to waste an entire semester in this one class completely waste it because
[3443.88 --> 3449.08]  it's never going to matter i know how to cook i didn't learn any of it from that class i have never
[3449.08 --> 3452.84]  needed to sew something and if i did i would take it to someone who was significantly better at it
[3452.84 --> 3458.68]  than i am what if they had a class at that time that had focused on seductive cooking we talked about
[3461.48 --> 3464.92]  i feel like that wouldn't fly in like in high school
[3468.20 --> 3472.12]  that would oh man i feel like the kids in the high school would probably find that more useful
[3472.12 --> 3481.88]  so anyway um anonymous asks are there any vr projects you guys are looking forward to in 2022
[3481.88 --> 3490.52]  honestly all i do is play beat saber so i heard that metas attempt at like a like virtual like
[3490.52 --> 3495.88]  v kind of a vr chat competitor basically immediately turned into all the same problems that vr chat has
[3495.88 --> 3501.64]  nice perfect so i kind of laughed about that i saw that coming um other than that i mean i'm always i'm
[3501.64 --> 3507.40]  always hoping for better headsets uh if if something at the quality and refresh rate of the index could
[3507.40 --> 3514.28]  be wireless wireless oh that'd be super cool that's that's the big waiting for it yeah quest 2 is not
[3514.28 --> 3522.12]  quite there i'm also extra good extra ready for a high refresh rate high resolution oled display i i it's
[3522.12 --> 3526.92]  very noticeable like far more than on a gaming monitor the the smearing as you're looking around is
[3526.92 --> 3532.20]  extremely noticeable even on the highest end headsets today so uh there's nothing specific that i can
[3532.20 --> 3539.48]  think of but that that comes to mind uh ben this is hi linus and luke i recently got an 8k tv and i
[3539.48 --> 3543.64]  struggle to find content besides youtube would you consider uploading in 8k or would there be a
[3543.64 --> 3548.20]  bottleneck in your workflow if you were to do so we actually recently downgraded our cameras we are now
[3548.20 --> 3553.88]  shooting on fx3s and fx6s which are 4k cameras rather than our reds the vast majority of the time
[3553.88 --> 3558.52]  we still shoot some stuff on red but we export everything at 4k because the reality of it is
[3558.52 --> 3563.88]  you are more limited by the bit rate that youtube delivers than by the number of pixels that you are
[3563.88 --> 3571.64]  packing into your exported file so you should we could still um export them in 8k and we could upload
[3571.64 --> 3577.88]  them as 8k it would be a little disruptive to the workflow but the main reason but you would probably
[3577.88 --> 3583.56]  still get a benefit to um the picture quality because it would serve you a higher bit rate really
[3583.56 --> 3591.08]  though for us we want to solve hdr before we bother moving to 8k because from a from a con from a perception
[3591.08 --> 3597.32]  standpoint it makes a larger difference to the quality than just upping the resolution in my opinion
[3597.88 --> 3602.60]  so jake actually pointed out and i forgot about this but it's totally true my i have this valve lanyard
[3602.60 --> 3608.84]  that i've liked for a long time another one and it it fell apart okay the threading completely lost
[3608.84 --> 3614.52]  it and jake was like i was like oh no i'm sad this is garbage now because despite taking one course of
[3614.52 --> 3620.28]  sewing i probably can't sew these like two extremely basic pieces of fabric together that's kind of sad
[3620.28 --> 3626.36]  jake took it home to his mom and it's it's holding up still it was great so like yeah i got nothing from
[3626.36 --> 3633.72]  that class there's very few things in my life that i will not try to fix if they break and that broke
[3633.72 --> 3640.60]  and i was immediately like guess it's garbage and taking that class would not have yeah that did not
[3640.60 --> 3646.68]  save me yeah there's a lot of people asking when will the matching wan hoodies be back on the site so
[3646.68 --> 3656.12]  i can get the rest of the set okay there's also a question coming up that asked about um like this
[3656.36 --> 3660.84]  this color the the color of the the indoor jacket yeah yeah yeah yeah they're wondering if there was
[3660.84 --> 3667.16]  going to be pants that match that type of color ah oh i don't think we have it in the plan
[3667.88 --> 3675.16]  unfortunately i um yeah i i i don't think that's in the plan right now let me just check my email
[3675.16 --> 3680.28]  from nick and i will get you the answer because nick keeps track of all this stuff oh this oh yeah this
[3680.28 --> 3687.32]  is the one wan hoodie and swack it containers are in the port now but they are not unloaded from the
[3687.32 --> 3696.68]  vessel yet this is as of yesterday okay so a month who knows who knows i don't know it will probably
[3696.68 --> 3701.64]  get taken off the vessel and put in a warehouse temporarily no it'll just be hucked in a field
[3701.64 --> 3706.92]  somewhere oh because it's a container right oh yeah okay so yeah if you wanted to search through every just
[3707.48 --> 3713.24]  in storage container in the lower mainland you might find one for free but don't do that
[3713.24 --> 3717.56]  don't do that that's a very bad idea that's a crime yeah it's like a very criminal um
[3719.24 --> 3725.56]  but i i yeah i theoretically theoretically when it's at that stage we could be launching it next week
[3726.20 --> 3730.76]  theoretically but that just is not the way that things have worked out it's been taking it's been
[3730.76 --> 3735.16]  taking weeks it's been incredibly frustrating so we'll get them as soon as we can there's a lot of
[3735.16 --> 3739.24]  people who asked about that so i think that's going to address a lot of the merge messages people sent
[3739.24 --> 3746.76]  yeah uh karen g asks thoughts on a liquid metal possibly mercury water cooling or like liquid
[3746.76 --> 3752.44]  cooling loop obviously not good for daily driving so uh we threw around the idea actually before the
[3752.44 --> 3758.44]  concern with mercury is that it eats things for one concern number two is that it's highly toxic uh concern
[3758.44 --> 3765.24]  number three is that when you heat it it like gets out into the air yeah so we will never do that
[3765.24 --> 3773.32]  but cool idea uh definitely love the idea uh it's just that in the real world it just don't work that way
[3773.32 --> 3780.52]  uh peter h uh when are we expecting the screwdriver and bag to cost exactly i gotta have gift cards ready
[3780.52 --> 3788.12]  so that when i buy them it doesn't hit my wallet so hard all right i'm speaking way out of turn here
[3788.12 --> 3795.40]  because these are decisions that i make alongside nick light but my expectation is that the screwdriver
[3795.40 --> 3800.60]  will be somewhere in the non-committal yeah yeah this is not a commitment the screwdriver will be
[3800.60 --> 3810.04]  somewhere in the 70 range for the standard edition 70 us okay that's for the standard edition it is
[3810.04 --> 3817.80]  possible there will be other editions that are available for more i would love to do like a luxe
[3818.60 --> 3824.12]  screwdriver and i've got some ideas for what that might look like it's just it's like the stupidest
[3824.12 --> 3829.16]  stuff ever guys like it's one of those things where with a straight face i could never tell you
[3830.12 --> 3837.80]  buy this but i just want to make it because it's really cool so this is what happens when you put like
[3837.80 --> 3843.80]  some idiot youtube influencer in charge of your product development it's like oh yes make it so
[3843.80 --> 3852.44]  make it so and like the engineers are just like really you know um as for the backpack
[3853.80 --> 3863.48]  i expect it to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 250 to 300 us dollars it will not be cheap quality but
[3863.48 --> 3872.92]  it's awesome i absolutely love it i've been daily driving it um i i'm yeah it's it's really great so uh
[3872.92 --> 3879.40]  they're gonna hurt the wallet i promise it but they're gonna be awesome uh tyler r asks any chance
[3879.40 --> 3887.48]  of a ball pouch version of the underwear um gotta confess not endowed enough for that to have been a concern for me
[3887.48 --> 3896.36]  i never thought of it um i don't think we have it in the plan anytime soon we're we're definitely
[3896.36 --> 3902.12]  looking at more underwear particularly we've had a lot of requests for women's underwear so we're working
[3902.12 --> 3911.00]  on that but no promises for ball underwear but your request is um noted thank you for that and congratulations
[3911.00 --> 3932.84]  uh adam r says i work for a state agency in the u.s in a cyber crime unit helping the most vulnerable in
[3932.84 --> 3939.48]  our society our hospital our office is in desperate need of a tech makeover would lmg be interested in
[3939.48 --> 3950.28]  a video collab addressing the same wow weird um it's crazy to me that you guys need a tech makeover yeah
[3950.28 --> 3957.00]  so i didn't know when i clicked this one like is this a government agency because if so like sounds
[3957.00 --> 3962.76]  like it i don't even think we'd be allowed yeah i i don't know if we'd i don't know if we'd even be
[3962.76 --> 3970.68]  able to do that i i think the the whole cyber crime thing is is interesting but like a tech makeover is
[3970.68 --> 3979.96]  probably literally not okay um yeah so cool suggestion i'm you know what i'm going to respectfully decline
[3979.96 --> 3986.20]  i think on this one it would be pretty cool but i just feel like we wouldn't really be able to show
[3986.20 --> 3991.48]  anything which would make the content just me walking around in a completely blurred out frame
[3992.04 --> 3998.84]  uh speaking of which uh control f fab i i know i saw some questions about the intel fab trip
[4000.04 --> 4006.84]  um oh that wasn't it okay oh never mind well they're coming as soon as they can i i haven't heard
[4006.84 --> 4012.92]  back from my intel rep to the point where i'm actually like kind of worried about him so well like i'm sure
[4012.92 --> 4017.08]  i'm sure i'm sure he's fine i'm sure i would have i'm sure i would have been notified of his you know
[4017.08 --> 4026.52]  role replacement or whatever if he was you know dead or fired or something yeah but um hopefully you're
[4026.52 --> 4036.12]  okay ew um ping me if you if you want to uh he might just be avoiding me because he's busy i mean at
[4036.12 --> 4041.32]  ces right now and reviewing our videos and trying to get all the executives lined up to get the fab videos
[4041.32 --> 4046.52]  going is going to be a bit of a bear but um yeah they'll come out as soon as they're ready uh oh
[4046.52 --> 4054.76]  halo infinite thingy oh yes okay thanks thanks thanks full punchet okay so first of all the backpack
[4054.76 --> 4061.32]  is amazing yep and all the device this always stuns me this part i find fascinating because you've
[4061.32 --> 4066.04]  how long have you been using this now uh i don't know like over a month though oh it's gotta be way over
[4066.04 --> 4070.04]  a month yeah i don't know exactly is this the same one you've been using yeah yeah i took it with me
[4070.04 --> 4075.40]  and to tel aviv and all that yeah it's got to be way over a month yeah it looks brand new well yeah
[4075.40 --> 4080.12]  and it's looked brand new the whole time well yeah i find that fascinating for a backpack because
[4080.12 --> 4085.08]  backpacks get beat up just like naturally so i got all my tech pockets right got my oh crap i better
[4085.08 --> 4090.28]  find my framework before i go home okay well my laptop's supposed to be in there and then i've got my
[4090.28 --> 4097.24]  a couple of handheld devices okay so this one is super cool i know that uh i uh just announced the next
[4097.24 --> 4106.20]  next which is a follow-up to this this is the neo pro okay but luke hasn't seen this thing and it is
[4106.20 --> 4112.92]  really freaking cool you've no no you haven't seen it in action true so i've i've been a little slow
[4112.92 --> 4118.68]  about getting my review done of it um and the reason for that is that i've just been a little slow
[4118.68 --> 4125.88]  sorry everyone uh but i'm finally on top of it and man is this thing ever cool unfortunately this is
[4125.88 --> 4129.56]  going to take me a minute to get signed in so do you want to do a couple of merch messages while i um
[4130.20 --> 4138.44]  d stupid fire yeah okay sorry one sec uh some of these i'm gonna have to kind of ask you um so
[4138.44 --> 4143.48]  matthew b says been watching for years thanks for making such great products uh know you've been making
[4143.48 --> 4149.32]  a lot of jackets do you plan on making a waterproof rain shell uh oh uh yes
[4149.32 --> 4162.84]  uh oh wow i did not expect that so this was actually included in the in the creator warehouse
[4162.84 --> 4167.56]  um in the creator warehouse newsletter which you should definitely subscribe to it's super cool
[4168.12 --> 4174.04]  they they talk about sort of behind the scenes the the tech of what we're working on so kyle's done a
[4174.04 --> 4182.28]  thing on injection molding sarah's talked about just color choices uh and this is actually featuring
[4182.28 --> 4189.24]  the kind of the the 3d printed down is what they is what the manufacturer calls it uh but essentially
[4189.24 --> 4196.52]  what it is is a super high r value so super high insulation value but hyper thin and super thin really
[4196.52 --> 4203.72]  comfortable material uh with a with a waterproof ever so slightly stretchy shell which is nice that i think
[4203.72 --> 4210.92]  is going to be absolutely killer uh we've got looks really sure is this the final design no no so i
[4210.92 --> 4215.56]  already like the like stealth lines and stuff those are going to be stealthier uh we found that they
[4215.56 --> 4221.64]  were a little bit too loud once you're actually wearing it sure um and then i think the back is
[4221.64 --> 4227.80]  going to be more like like dots or something instead of this like big line uh the fit is bang on but
[4227.80 --> 4232.68]  there's some other details we need to figure out like this velcro is awful it's abominable so we'll
[4232.68 --> 4238.36]  have to deal with that the hood fit is excellent the taping is excellent so uh we're really do you
[4238.36 --> 4244.12]  have dual lines on the hood uh we're really yeah we're really pleased with this manufacturer overall
[4244.12 --> 4250.20]  uh waterproof zippers obviously everywhere um i think it might be kind of cool to do an interior
[4250.20 --> 4256.28]  pocket now that i think about it i i i yeah we're it's still very much in development but it'll it'll
[4256.28 --> 4261.16]  happen i've been asked to try it on okay fine one sec uh do you want to do it other thing in the meantime
[4261.16 --> 4267.80]  yeah just trying to find one okay i'm going to save that one for when linus is more available
[4273.32 --> 4279.64]  so just like a pretty yeah that looks really sharp yeah so we're gonna we're gonna fix this thing
[4279.64 --> 4284.44]  it's got kind of like a flap here okay um so we're either going to go all the way down or we're going
[4284.44 --> 4289.16]  to eliminate it entirely and just do like a little zipper garage at the top so it kind of gets in the way
[4289.16 --> 4294.20]  so these are the kinds of little details that we catch when yeah when we're daily driving the um
[4294.76 --> 4301.32]  early production units but yeah that's what it looks like really like the fit it looks really
[4301.32 --> 4307.88]  sharp no restriction on it whatsoever um i trust that the the new design directions will only improve
[4307.88 --> 4313.56]  it but i'm like a big fan of its aesthetic already yeah i've been wearing it like every day i'm excited to
[4313.56 --> 4319.32]  wear snowboarding at some point it's not really designed for that do you know how i'm warm do you
[4319.32 --> 4325.00]  know what i do though right you're a warm boy yeah so all i do is i wear a sweater and a rain shell
[4325.00 --> 4328.44]  i don't i don't wear like a snowboarding jacket because they're usually too hot for me okay um
[4328.44 --> 4332.36]  there are long enough though it's not really long enough for that it's really not designed for that
[4332.36 --> 4337.72]  i don't want to oversell it no one else should do this it's for like but i'm probably gonna do it's for like
[4337.72 --> 4345.64]  four to ten degrees outside weather and raining and just kind of like miserable ugly sort of low
[4345.64 --> 4351.00]  but not below freezing weather that's what it's really designed for we're doing the fit kind of
[4351.00 --> 4356.20]  uh kind of bulky so that if like i often layer up so i'll wear a stealth hoodie or i'll wear a
[4356.20 --> 4361.72]  wan hoodie under it yeah and that's very intentional i like that use case for those shells uh while you
[4361.72 --> 4367.32]  keep on working on that someone asked are there any plans for ltt socks yes there is i don't know if
[4367.32 --> 4373.16]  there's any updates on it uh yeah the prototypes on my desk upstairs man but lots of stuff going on
[4373.16 --> 4379.00]  but uh we have been working on socks for over a year yeah and uh well over a year actually it's been
[4379.00 --> 4383.96]  about a year and a half and i have yet to find something that i'm happy with we've got a manufacturer
[4383.96 --> 4390.20]  whose quality i am pleased with but we are still working to get the exact composition and the exact
[4390.20 --> 4396.68]  weave of the merino correct and one of the things that what i will do in the meantime is i'll endorse
[4396.68 --> 4401.08]  another sock manufacturer who makes an absolutely great product can't go wrong they're called darn
[4401.08 --> 4406.84]  tough uh they make socks in vermont they're extremely expensive but they man these things
[4406.84 --> 4412.36]  last like nothing i have ever seen before in my life and they even have orange ones oh i'm not wearing
[4412.36 --> 4417.00]  the orange ones today well i've had a lot of people speculate that i'm wearing ltt socks when i
[4417.00 --> 4423.16]  wear the orange ones uh but they're not they're they're darn tough socks and if we can't if we can't
[4423.16 --> 4429.40]  reach that tier of quality we're basically just not going to make socks so have you talked to darn
[4429.40 --> 4434.52]  tough we have they don't do oem work so we kind of went okay well fair enough then we're gonna have to
[4435.16 --> 4443.16]  we're gonna have to take our business elsewhere and yeah so we're yeah we're we're trying we're trying to
[4443.16 --> 4449.00]  get there um one of the big challenges right now is they do an outstanding job of making the sock
[4449.00 --> 4455.88]  cushioned and yet structurally sound so one of the problems i run into is when i'm putting my
[4455.88 --> 4460.36]  sock into something like a tight-fitting gym shoe uh like something that's designed to fit really tight
[4460.36 --> 4465.64]  like a badminton shoe or something like a snowboard boot yeah right you don't want the heel to get
[4465.64 --> 4471.40]  pulled up halfway up your calf so you need something that has enough structure to the base of it that it's
[4471.40 --> 4476.60]  not going to get pulled around on your foot and you know even just you know wearing my daily driver
[4476.60 --> 4482.76]  sandals or whatever uh if you move sideways i hate it when my socks slip yes around on my foot
[4482.76 --> 4489.40]  the worst drives me absolutely crazy so i miss tech news says prime packet wrong show wrong show it's
[4489.40 --> 4496.60]  not a tech news show um so we want something that is going to hold up to all the all the little sort of
[4496.60 --> 4501.88]  irritations that i have with crappy socks and it's been it's been totally a thing yep it's been difficult
[4501.88 --> 4510.28]  uh joseph s says winter stealth bottle in brackets white on white when p.s i am now going to start
[4510.28 --> 4519.40]  calling bromine bro i hate it i hate it so much uh winter stealth bottle um i actually would be surprised
[4519.40 --> 4525.48]  if we ever do it to be honest with you and the reason for that is that we have experimented with that
[4525.48 --> 4531.80]  color scheme before and it really just did not translate i think i remember it looking weird there
[4531.80 --> 4535.96]  is a water bottle project that i don't know if we're talking about that i'm actually very excited
[4535.96 --> 4541.96]  for the thick boy the thick boy yeah there's gonna be there's pretty stoked there's gonna be a bigger
[4541.96 --> 4549.00]  water bottle it's huge it's like a day's worth of water in one bottle which is totally what i want
[4549.00 --> 4552.36]  that's fantastic if i can just fill it up in the morning and if i drink the whole thing by the time
[4552.36 --> 4561.48]  i go to bed i'm like pretty solid ridiculous all right i love it um ounces can we say ounces yet
[4561.48 --> 4567.08]  i don't remember how many it is 64 i think okay i'm pretty sure i'm not 100 i could have said that
[4567.08 --> 4571.56]  wrong ludicrous don't quote me yeah don't don't quote him on that because we we're just dumb people
[4571.56 --> 4576.52]  have no idea what's going on talk to nick yep uh brin at well don't talk to nick don't bother nick
[4576.52 --> 4582.92]  it is the weekend okay that's why no tweet him no don't no don't don't that's how that's we're gonna
[4582.92 --> 4587.72]  lose our leaking privileges we're not going to be allowed to leak product anymore if it ruins nick's
[4587.72 --> 4592.36]  weekend every time don't tweet them if you want to learn more about products don't subscribe to
[4592.36 --> 4604.52]  the newsletter yeah okay all right big brain um okay so this is really cool this is um halo infinite
[4605.24 --> 4611.80]  running on a handheld okay one second one second just just chill just chill uh where's the where's
[4611.80 --> 4620.76]  the stupid quick no where's the uh bot boot camp here we go uh sure whatever play okay okay this is
[4620.76 --> 4629.80]  like kind of mind-blowing uh now this is not okay this is not um running rdna2 graphics like the
[4629.80 --> 4637.64]  upcoming steam deck will but unlike their previous one which i actually have in my tech backpack as well
[4637.64 --> 4645.40]  i love this thing uh unlike their previous one the a neo or i neo uh founder edition one it's got
[4645.40 --> 4653.32]  um what are they vega 8 rather than vega 6 graphics so it's a full like 30 percent wider gpu core and
[4653.32 --> 4660.92]  it's clocked 15 percent higher which based on the performance numbers that i saw of the of this one the
[4660.92 --> 4667.24]  founders against the steam deck prototype that i tested puts it within striking distance although there's
[4667.24 --> 4673.00]  still lots of room for valve to optimize i love this by the way i got to talk about jake's comment
[4673.00 --> 4677.72]  here in a second there's still lots of room for valve to optimize both on the hardware side and on
[4677.72 --> 4681.56]  the software side especially because they're running such a lightweight operating system you see how much
[4681.56 --> 4687.64]  they shed from the size of their uh steam os 3.0 image no i i forget what it was but it was like
[4687.64 --> 4692.44]  obscene like it's a fraction the size that it was before they just de-bloated the crap out of it crazy
[4692.44 --> 4700.12]  this is great uh jake asks can the can the aya play ano i've got jake into ano now what actually
[4700.12 --> 4705.48]  well he saw me playing around with it when we did a video at my new house and he had always kind of
[4705.48 --> 4711.08]  made fun of me for it actually he's like oh you're always talking about ano oh ano and then he messages
[4711.08 --> 4717.40]  me like shortly afterward he's like okay i'm gonna try ano should i try ano i'm like well it's kind of a
[4717.40 --> 4725.32]  polarizing game it's not for everyone um but if you like optimizing things and if you like building
[4725.32 --> 4732.20]  style games you might really enjoy it or if you can pair with someone who does and he's been he's
[4732.20 --> 4738.36]  been messaging me about it and like he's been he's been like into it now it's great we should make a we
[4738.36 --> 4744.44]  should make a three-person uh whatever you call it expedition something okay here you go here you go try
[4744.44 --> 4749.64]  it out try it out that is halo infinite running on oh wait actually hold on hold on do i even have it
[4749.64 --> 4756.36]  in uh do i even have it in like juicer mode i do i do so you can it's really cool uh this is some
[4756.36 --> 4761.88]  software they added you can actually configure your tdp of the chip on the fly so you can just be like uh
[4761.88 --> 4767.00]  yeah i want to run in balanced 15 watt mode you double tap well normally you double tap it all right
[4767.00 --> 4771.40]  it's being stupid right now of course when you go to demo something it immediately breaks but
[4771.40 --> 4776.28]  uh we're we're in like big big chungus 20 watt mode right now a question for you while i play with
[4776.28 --> 4783.64]  this for a second um any chances uh joshua w says oh it's gone uh any chances for kid-sized shirts is
[4783.64 --> 4790.12]  what he asked we want to do kid-sized shirts right now our insurance is um does not allow us to do
[4790.12 --> 4795.96]  children's garments and it's not an impossible thing for us to do but it's something that we potentially
[4795.96 --> 4803.64]  could do in the future so yeah we'll we'll see how that goes uh jonathan asks how do you tell a
[4803.64 --> 4807.72]  good pc distributor for commercial uses i've been trying to find one for a long time but haven't
[4807.72 --> 4812.28]  found one that's reliable do you have any recommendations honestly i don't even know
[4812.92 --> 4820.28]  what a commercial user looks for in a pc distributor um what are the what are the differences
[4820.28 --> 4825.00]  is there a reason you wouldn't just buy in bulk from like new egg or amazon do they have corporate
[4825.00 --> 4833.64]  reps sorry i i just i have not been concerned with procurement in a very very long time so playing
[4833.64 --> 4840.12]  a shooter game on a controller feels like butthole okay but um that's fair enough it feels like it's
[4840.12 --> 4846.12]  running well what's the frame rate at it's up here i've got a frame view running oh average yeah okay
[4846.12 --> 4852.92]  so it's hitting around 30 yeah which like no i did not expect 60 fps and halo infinite on this thing
[4852.92 --> 4860.12]  but it is 100 playable yeah pretty cool right that's pretty nuts actually that's cool that's exciting
[4860.76 --> 4865.64]  this thing is like that gives me more hope for steam deck kind of sick it's also interesting that
[4865.64 --> 4872.04]  it's running halo infinite and the air out of the back which my hand 100 went over yes cool well but
[4872.04 --> 4877.56]  that's the intake so the exhaust is out the top where it doesn't interfere with your hands at all
[4877.56 --> 4885.08]  that makes sense and i'm just halo infinite is just it's mostly interesting from a what really really
[4885.08 --> 4890.04]  heavy game yeah kind of standpoint just because it's such a heavy game and it's obviously popular right
[4890.04 --> 4897.00]  now but for me the bigger one is that you can run breath of the wild at over 30 fps on this thing
[4897.64 --> 4901.96]  and that's in the 15 watts somewhat reasonable mode that won't chew through the battery in like two
[4901.96 --> 4911.72]  hours right so what's crazy about this is that it's the do absolutely anything computer yeah
[4911.72 --> 4917.64]  literally yeah it's sweet anything because you can dock it and uh expand with screens and peripherals and
[4917.64 --> 4924.60]  whatever i've got playstation running on it i've got ps2 running on it i've got um the wii u version of
[4924.60 --> 4930.92]  breath of the wild running on it in the pc games running on it it's like there's nothing it can't do in
[4930.92 --> 4936.44]  the current environment of hardware prices is it like that bad of an idea for someone to just buy
[4936.44 --> 4945.08]  one of those well the thing is that the steam deck is sort of in this sort of does it exist does it not
[4945.08 --> 4954.04]  exist stage where it is announced but you can't buy one and valve says they will ship it at x time but
[4954.04 --> 4959.00]  they could easily delay it i mean it wouldn't be the first time that valve ever delayed a product
[4959.00 --> 4965.24]  and we don't know how and we don't know how friendly windows will be on it either we have i i think it'll
[4965.24 --> 4970.60]  be fine i think that valve is i think that valve is clever enough people to understand that not
[4970.60 --> 4975.64]  everybody is going to want to run steam os 3.0 hopefully it's great and everybody does but yeah i i
[4975.64 --> 4983.00]  agree i i i think it's not realistic for everyone to end up running steam os 3.0 at it on it and i
[4983.00 --> 4988.20]  think that valve is absolutely going to be doing the smart thing and internally validating the device
[4988.20 --> 4993.24]  on windows for sure for sure there's just absolutely no way they don't do it martin m says let's see how
[4993.24 --> 4999.24]  long this takes to come still waiting on a previous order hit up support um yeah do but also understand
[4999.24 --> 5003.56]  that they are a little bit backlogged right now super swamp we've had time off because of the holidays
[5003.56 --> 5009.80]  because we're not a totally horrible employer to work for and then also there's an influx of messages
[5009.80 --> 5014.04]  over the holidays joe doesn't know this um and neither does nick but i'm going to talk to nick
[5014.04 --> 5018.60]  about joe potentially helping oh okay that would be really helpful they told me their support ticket
[5018.60 --> 5026.20]  number today and my jaw hit the floor so hard i almost flipped over yeah we're trying we're trying
[5026.20 --> 5030.52]  you got to understand we are not amazon you know we don't have call centers around the world that are
[5030.52 --> 5037.00]  uh that are monitoring tickets and calls like we're we're still a pretty small operation um but we're
[5037.00 --> 5042.04]  we're absolutely doing our best and once we do get back to you i promise we'll get whatever it is
[5042.04 --> 5047.40]  taken care of yep um starlet scarf a big fan of yours for years or been a fan of yours for years not
[5047.40 --> 5052.12]  a big one sorry small small one maybe i've i'm a visually impaired cs major you've inspired me every
[5052.12 --> 5058.20]  step of the way any thoughts on the difference in some usbc cables capability like pd versus transfer rates
[5058.20 --> 5064.92]  i've seen many people have issues with this oh what a what uh what a rabbit hole that one is
[5065.88 --> 5071.16]  when we do our cables and that's a when not an if that is absolutely something that we are going to
[5071.16 --> 5077.56]  clearly mark on them you will never i promise you this is my personal linus tech tips guarantee
[5077.56 --> 5087.64]  we will never mark an hdmi 2.0 cable hdmi 2.1a cable our pd ratings our maximum rated transfer speeds
[5088.44 --> 5094.12]  they will be accurate and they will be clearly marked i promise there's nothing i can do about
[5094.12 --> 5101.88]  the cluster that exists in the current space we will hopefully be able to list uh or link to a labs
[5101.88 --> 5109.72]  page on the cable even um hopefully eventually hopefully maybe that's the goal um you never replied
[5109.72 --> 5115.00]  to my email about that what we need to have a meeting about like creating a like a scope i did
[5115.00 --> 5123.08]  reply well when did you reply was it like today uh maybe i didn't reply luke getting called out luke
[5123.08 --> 5127.08]  getting called out live on wancho no i don't reply from you um did i talk to you about it outside of
[5127.08 --> 5132.52]  the email weird so we need to have a meeting sort of defining what the the scope is for that it does it
[5132.52 --> 5135.80]  take over linus tech tips.com and then the forum becomes like a discussion
[5135.80 --> 5140.76]  sub site does it do we create a new domain for it i i don't know we need to figure all that out
[5140.76 --> 5149.72]  but we've got time yeah um what were we talking about uh well we're just going through merch messages
[5149.72 --> 5156.76]  oh yeah we're talking about usb cables uh okay uh david t says how come the wan hoodie only has a
[5156.76 --> 5162.60]  two-piece hood but the stealth hoodie and the swack at v2 have three-piece hoods that is a tremendous
[5162.60 --> 5168.68]  question and if hannah or bridget were here i'm sure they would be able to tell you um matthew from our
[5168.68 --> 5173.08]  team was not actually involved in any of those garments but he'd probably be able to tell you too so
[5173.08 --> 5180.52]  those are our fashion designer fit technician team um i have no idea i'm sorry frugivore hopefully i'm
[5180.52 --> 5184.76]  saying that right yeah float plane chat said no keep the forum he wasn't saying getting rid of the forum
[5184.76 --> 5190.04]  no no it would just be navigational changes yeah navigational changes yeah um it would still be there
[5190.04 --> 5195.16]  it would be a way for the forum's existence to be justified from a business standpoint because i
[5195.16 --> 5201.72]  promise you it doesn't make money uh brendan says this will go so well with my line of work how does hot
[5201.72 --> 5210.84]  coffee hold up in the bottles okay so it is a water bottle we do not we do not endorse the use of other
[5210.84 --> 5220.84]  liquids in the bottle however i have seen many user reports that it keeps coffee hot very well the one
[5220.84 --> 5225.96]  challenge for me with putting anything other than coffee in any water bottle i don't i don't like putting
[5225.96 --> 5231.40]  non-water beverages in water bottles you got to only do that thing forever pretty much um and
[5231.72 --> 5236.36]  challenge is that cleaning them is a bit of a chore because it's it's hard to get in there and you
[5236.36 --> 5242.44]  should never put an insulated water bottle in the dishwasher yeah so as long as you've got a scrubby for
[5242.44 --> 5248.76]  cleaning it out or you don't mind having like coffee residue inside your bottle then i can't stop you from
[5248.76 --> 5255.80]  doing that it's your product it's it's your thing item yeah you own it but i i don't uh it's it's not it's
[5255.80 --> 5261.56]  it's a water bottle that is the officially supported liquid being like that about it being all corporate
[5262.12 --> 5268.60]  uh brin asks i'm curious to hear what if any tech you guys are excited for that isn't quite ready for
[5268.60 --> 5275.00]  prime time but feels like it's around the corner i feel like my answer is kind of cop out for this
[5275.56 --> 5282.28]  um and it's definitely ready for prime time because the app that goes along with it was number one on the
[5282.28 --> 5288.28]  app store at christmas time tick tock no you're into tick tock you want more tick tock no you sure
[5288.28 --> 5294.36]  yes more dancing and singing along with stolen music don't really like tick tock too much um
[5294.92 --> 5301.64]  no but it's a little more it's vr i i think it's very close that is a cop-out answer thank you the quest
[5301.64 --> 5312.52]  two is fantastic but it's not really there you know it's it's like it's so close but i still fit
[5312.52 --> 5317.32]  when i'm trying to move the controls around it still feels a little laggy and i know they don't
[5317.32 --> 5321.40]  have external sensors and all this kind of stuff i know what they're fighting against is like huge and
[5321.40 --> 5326.20]  what they've accomplished with the quest 2 is very respectable but i'm really excited for like the next
[5326.20 --> 5333.24]  few steps of vr and i i've never felt like we were there's been times in the past where i had kind of
[5333.24 --> 5338.84]  a sense of despair about vr because like it's not there and it's going to take so long and now i'm
[5338.84 --> 5343.32]  like it's not there but i feel it and it's right around the corner and i'm really stoked so that's
[5343.32 --> 5349.32]  i guess that's my answer yep that was a cop-out answer it was uh honestly handheld gaming is
[5349.32 --> 5353.16]  something i'm super passionate about it's kind of a cop-out answer you literally had on the desk
[5353.16 --> 5357.88]  going back to the nvidia shield right the that android gaming portable that they had shield
[5357.88 --> 5364.36]  portable i guess they retconned the name too um i i absolutely loved that thing i love the concept of
[5364.36 --> 5369.48]  streaming games uh you know locally from a higher powered machine over the network that's something
[5369.48 --> 5375.56]  i'm also super excited about i mean dell even showed off a concept of a gaming server inside your
[5375.56 --> 5381.32]  home at ces yep it's exactly what we talked about on the wan show like six years ago or whatever
[5381.32 --> 5387.00]  and we have a demo coming i love that with one gpu four gamers where we do the same thing we take
[5387.00 --> 5393.00]  a consumer nvidia gpu and split it out into multiple workers and then people can remote in through the
[5393.00 --> 5398.84]  network and use parsec to actually game on the same machine at a time super cool um those are technologies
[5398.84 --> 5405.72]  that i'm really excited about like the mobility of computing and gaming in particular because that's like
[5405.72 --> 5411.88]  you know yeah i mean it's neat i can track my steps or whatever but unless the screen is big enough to
[5411.88 --> 5417.08]  play games it's hard for it to really hold my attention is the truth yeah um okay there's a big
[5417.08 --> 5423.96]  discussion in float plane chat led by a prime and jake of all people about well why shouldn't we be allowed
[5423.96 --> 5430.12]  to put our water bottles in the dishwasher if we have a no heat setting yes if you have a no heat
[5430.12 --> 5436.44]  setting on your dishwasher you can put it in the dishwasher if you really want to i'm just for the
[5436.44 --> 5442.44]  sake of for the sake of just protecting you know the people who are can't be trusted to set their
[5442.44 --> 5448.44]  dishwasher exactly correctly every time we say it's not dishwasher safe but yes you could do that yeah
[5452.04 --> 5457.48]  all right um yeah no we don't own an aircraft yet that's a merch message that just came in
[5457.48 --> 5464.04]  not yet anyway joshua asks linus what is the complete story behind you and your ncix days
[5464.04 --> 5470.36]  telling vendors ahead of time no we have no intention of paying you also do you guys have enough in stock
[5470.36 --> 5478.92]  of the land pants okay so that's not is that from the roast is that from taron telling that story in
[5478.92 --> 5483.32]  the roast or something like that okay so i'm trying to figure out what that is in reference to maybe i told
[5483.32 --> 5496.20]  the story but but basically um i i told a vendor that we um just i was talking about my order and i said
[5496.20 --> 5502.52]  hey um i forget exactly what i said it was either something along the lines of like i need net 60 terms
[5502.52 --> 5509.00]  because realistically uh we're gonna pay in net 60 anyway even if you give us net 30 terms it was either
[5509.00 --> 5514.84]  that or it was like uh they were complaining about not getting paid and i said something along the
[5514.84 --> 5522.04]  lines of like well yeah it's kind of going around right now but we're gonna yeah we're gonna we're
[5522.04 --> 5527.32]  gonna well no this wasn't even at the end this was just ncix having cash flow problems and stretching
[5527.32 --> 5537.16]  their terms with vendors because basically management either through um ignorance or malice i can't tell
[5537.16 --> 5544.84]  anymore had decided selfishly that their own cash flow issues were the only priority and anyone else's
[5544.84 --> 5549.88]  cash flow issues were not a priority so constantly when i would go and i would complain to upper
[5549.88 --> 5554.84]  management or accounting that my vendors need to be paid hey we already turned through all the
[5554.84 --> 5559.56]  inventory what are we waiting for we have the money to pay for it from customers now in our bank
[5559.56 --> 5565.24]  account theoretically assuming you're not pissing it away on something we need to pay the bill and they
[5565.24 --> 5569.32]  would always say you need to ask for more time you need to ask for understanding so we can have the
[5569.32 --> 5573.64]  cash flow to maintain our business i'm like well what about their cash flow like i don't understand
[5573.64 --> 5579.00]  this this doesn't make any sense we got yeah did we bring in the product and sell it and then now we
[5579.00 --> 5587.48]  can pay for it or not um so basically i i disclosed that we were stretching our terms and that we were
[5587.48 --> 5594.04]  not paying vendors on time and uh taryn called me into his office and was like did i just hear what
[5594.04 --> 5599.56]  i thought i heard um you you can't you can't tell people that like do you have any idea how bad that
[5599.56 --> 5603.64]  looks and like from my point of view i was like yes sir yes sir but from my point of view i was like
[5603.64 --> 5609.16]  well if it looks bad then maybe we should probably pay our vendors on time yeah but that's not something
[5609.16 --> 5616.20]  i can control it's not something he can control so it was an important lesson in just sort of uh etiquette
[5616.20 --> 5623.40]  you know if you're good and stretching terms is absolutely a thing in many industries and many
[5623.40 --> 5629.56]  vendors but it's not something from from for personally that i agree with we don't stretch
[5629.56 --> 5634.52]  our terms here uh we've i don't think to my knowledge in over nine years of operation ever
[5634.52 --> 5638.92]  been laid on a paycheck for example i don't i don't believe in that everyone else has cash flow issues too
[5638.92 --> 5647.80]  um but when i'm not in control of that which i wasn't i have to tow the company line so um that
[5647.80 --> 5653.96]  was that was the story there as for whether we have enough wan pants in stock we certainly did before
[5653.96 --> 5662.20]  we started um i have no idea what kind of situation we're looking at now it's probably dire we definitely
[5662.20 --> 5668.52]  moved a few yeah just a little bit just a little bit you know what we'll be i think we'll we'll be
[5668.52 --> 5675.32]  okay for a little bit the problem is just that our restock is pretty far away so that's the that's the
[5675.32 --> 5680.52]  main issue we're gonna have a restock of hoodies before we have a restock of pants so if you were
[5680.52 --> 5686.68]  holding out to buy the hoodie and the pants together i can't guarantee that they're in stockness will
[5686.68 --> 5696.52]  will overlap um yeah uh joshua w i already talked about kid sized shirts um we can't do it until we
[5697.24 --> 5705.24]  revise our until we revise our insurance and until we get our our own branded shirt blanks out into
[5705.24 --> 5710.12]  the field make sure that they're really going to hold up to the real world and then we start working
[5710.12 --> 5716.60]  on the the chunky boy fit the lanky boy fit the women's fit maybe we do kids fits the future
[5716.68 --> 5726.84]  the future of the ltt brand is clothing not merch so yeah pretty much you name it we intend to
[5726.84 --> 5731.72]  address it at some point but we are we're cash flow constrained right like that's something i'll talk
[5731.72 --> 5736.52]  about honestly with you guys whether the optics are good or not um we're at the point now where
[5737.16 --> 5743.40]  creator warehouse could probably use an outside investor i i think i just i don't want to do it
[5743.40 --> 5752.04]  because i just don't like people telling me what to do but i i think that if we were being honest
[5752.04 --> 5755.88]  you know they've got a new space they're moving into they're gonna have to furnish it they're gonna
[5755.88 --> 5761.08]  have to hire a bunch of people if we wanted it to grow the absolute fastest it possibly could
[5761.72 --> 5767.16]  we could use outside investment but we've also really enjoyed doing things the way that we want to
[5767.16 --> 5771.24]  do them if it takes you're gonna have a really hard time continuing to do that with outside investment
[5771.24 --> 5775.56]  because the ltt stores ran in a somewhat unique way if it takes a year and a half to make a pair
[5775.56 --> 5780.04]  of socks then damn it it takes a year and a half and i think not a lot of many people are going to be
[5780.04 --> 5786.52]  super cool with that um that aren't the audience yeah i mean i mean honestly that's something that
[5787.16 --> 5791.56]  theoretically we could do but the problem is that as soon as we have a bunch of international investors
[5791.56 --> 5797.24]  i didn't mean that but yeah as soon as we have a bunch of international investment it is a minefield
[5797.24 --> 5802.76]  legally and accounting wise it's just it's just awful and i don't feel like dealing with it so
[5802.76 --> 5807.64]  so that's where we're at on that we're not going to go public anytime soon no no no um jackson do you
[5807.64 --> 5812.12]  have any other prints of the desk pad on the horizon uh there's going to be a stealth one and i think
[5812.12 --> 5815.80]  there's something else with like kind of like cool circuits or something like that it's kind of inspired
[5815.80 --> 5821.88]  by the circuit wall in the lounge also do you see opportunities for non-phd it enthusiasts at lmg in the
[5821.88 --> 5827.00]  near to midterm future graduating graduating my bachelor soon and looking for work any job search
[5827.00 --> 5833.80]  advice i.t enthusiasts i mean yeah it's tough right like you just got to keep an eye on the on the jobs
[5833.80 --> 5840.68]  page the jobs page we're almost always hiring these days so i don't know what to tell you other than
[5840.68 --> 5845.48]  keep an eye out uh string place says any new beanie designs coming i'd love to see some brighter color
[5845.48 --> 5850.12]  really brighter colors okay and maybe multi-color designs i don't think we have anything planned for
[5850.12 --> 5855.72]  multi-color but i'm sure sarah would love to do another round of finding fun colors or coming up
[5855.72 --> 5861.56]  with like some cool like patches and stuff to put on them uh anything's possible but there's nothing
[5861.56 --> 5866.92]  imminent blake heck of a job to your team pumping out videos this week also shout out to my buddy
[5866.92 --> 5874.92]  travis watching you'll be sleeping on this pillow oh that's so nice you got a cpu pillow for travis wow i
[5874.92 --> 5878.92]  know there wasn't a question but i thought that one was like yeah give a shout out to the team it's
[5878.92 --> 5884.44]  positive wholesome good lance the u.s copyright office is looking at changing regulations about
[5884.44 --> 5890.12]  automatic content id systems they're taking public comments for a month this is everyone's chance to
[5890.12 --> 5895.72]  make their voices heard about content id abuse hey what a great message thanks lance um enjoy your
[5895.72 --> 5900.04]  mystery water bottle and your black beanie and thank you very much for bringing that to everyone's
[5900.04 --> 5903.40]  attention it's gonna be really interesting if three quarters of twitch creators can't just watch
[5903.40 --> 5908.44]  youtube all day anymore yeah i'm not even necessarily like calling anyone out but that's like
[5908.44 --> 5915.72]  a huge thing an automatic content id could really bring that down in a in a crazy way that would
[5915.72 --> 5920.04]  actually be a massive change for i guess not just twitch creators but like live streamers in general
[5920.04 --> 5924.68]  that's a huge portion of what live streamers have been doing wow that would that would totally change
[5924.68 --> 5930.36]  the space if if automatic content id came to more platforms and how it was more regulated and all that
[5930.36 --> 5935.72]  kind of stuff okay it's going to be on a commercial flight vladdy daddy 88 we don't have our own plane
[5936.60 --> 5943.08]  uh andre j says how do i wash the desk pad i might or may not have spilled some red bull on it so um this
[5943.08 --> 5948.44]  is not official this is just what i've tried and it works but you just machine wash cold lay it flat to
[5948.44 --> 5954.68]  dry and it looks like the day you got it pretty much from my experience your mileage may vary your
[5954.68 --> 5960.84]  detergent or your washer settings might completely destroy it i don't know so failing that what you
[5960.84 --> 5966.36]  can also do and i think this is more officials you can take something like a like a scrubby scrubby
[5966.36 --> 5971.00]  cloth like a microfiber cloth or something like that uh get it kind of saturated in liquid and
[5971.00 --> 5975.00]  detergent you can just kind of scrub it just make sure that you don't only scrub in one spot because
[5975.00 --> 5979.64]  it's a black pad so you'll end up with like one faded spot so you need to make sure you kind of feather it
[5979.64 --> 5985.56]  out and scrub all around and then i would give it a rinse and then let it uh let it just lay flat to
[5985.56 --> 5991.08]  dry and you should be good to go mark c i'd love to see a highlight video of lmg employees personal
[5991.08 --> 5996.04]  twitch channels so what i was thinking with this yeah is is that you just want more personal promotion
[5996.04 --> 6001.96]  no on lmg official we've talked about this luke you're putting me under pressure live you're
[6001.96 --> 6006.68]  putting me under pressure like i meant to read this one before you did because i was going to kind of
[6006.68 --> 6013.88]  co-op his merch message yeah and say if you want to see more stuff about uh lmg employees personal
[6013.88 --> 6019.40]  stuff a very interesting way to do that is to subscribe to floatplane and check out the meet
[6019.40 --> 6024.60]  the team videos there's actually quite a few at this point um i'm going to work with the the
[6024.60 --> 6028.44]  live media group team to get some of the old exclusives tagged with the exclusive tags so it can be
[6028.44 --> 6034.20]  more easy to find some of the old exclusive content built up there there is like there's actually
[6034.20 --> 6039.48]  years worth um so there's there's a lot of meet the teams too and there's it's actually pretty
[6039.48 --> 6043.08]  interesting to see people in a casual setting just talking about themselves instead of talking
[6043.08 --> 6047.64]  about tech stuff so if you want to kind of meet the team with a variety of the team members maybe
[6047.64 --> 6052.52]  check out floatplane lucky falcore on floatplane says hey did you guys hear sonos won the patent
[6052.52 --> 6057.00]  case against google and google speakers are getting nerfed as a result instead of google paying royalties
[6057.00 --> 6060.92]  to sonos i did i think it's time for me to just switch from youtube music to spotify
[6061.48 --> 6066.92]  because it drives me crazy that google play music i used to be able to just natively cast to my sonos
[6066.92 --> 6071.40]  speakers but ever since those two got in a tiff you haven't been able to do it anymore and that's
[6071.40 --> 6077.08]  part of the transition to youtube music is my understanding and it just sucks because the sonos
[6077.08 --> 6083.56]  music app sucks because nobody should ever use it you should just use your native music service app and
[6083.56 --> 6089.00]  then you should just cast to your sonos so i think that might be the thing that just breaks me and
[6089.00 --> 6094.20]  pushes me to spotify apparently they have good migration tools jake's been on me to switch to
[6094.20 --> 6100.20]  spotify for freaking youtube music is trash yeah but i have youtube premium that's why i have it as
[6100.20 --> 6104.36]  well and i have a family plan so i just like have all the youtube premium and all the youtube music
[6104.36 --> 6111.48]  i don't yeah but that's not youtube premium so now i have now i have to also have premium am
[6111.48 --> 6117.08]  i wrong i might just sucks youtube premium just automatically include youtube music i believe so
[6117.08 --> 6122.68]  oh i could be wrong it might be a small adder if it was cheaper then that helps cover a bit of
[6122.68 --> 6129.32]  at least cheap foster w as a sales rep at leon's it's very difficult for me to explain to customers
[6129.32 --> 6134.36]  the difference between hertz and the manufacturer listed motion rate what's the easiest way to explain
[6134.36 --> 6139.80]  the difference i've got it for you because this is how i used to explain it to customers the the hertz
[6139.80 --> 6148.28]  right is the input is the input frame rate okay or frequency or whatever let's let's sorry nothing
[6148.28 --> 6154.20]  sorry i was talking to jake oh let's use let's use frame rate okay so the the hertz is your input frame
[6154.20 --> 6161.24]  rate then whatever your clear motion or clear smoothing motion smoothing or whatever that is that's the
[6161.24 --> 6169.40]  output frame rate so the way that you can explain it is that any difference between this and this is fake
[6169.40 --> 6177.48]  it's guesswork it's filling in the blanks so that's why this is critical and this is garbage because
[6177.48 --> 6183.56]  anytime you're guessing there's always going to be some incorrect guesses and i remember it just being
[6183.56 --> 6189.56]  the stupidest thing ever ncix had this samsung showcase store at one point and one of the demos
[6189.56 --> 6196.52]  that samsung sent over to to show off one of their you know tops was in metrotown uh it was in aberdeen
[6196.52 --> 6201.72]  center one of their top tier tvs was i think it was like bbc planet earth where all the birds are
[6201.72 --> 6207.80]  flying at the same time and i don't know whether it was samsung's fault or ncix's fault but we had it
[6207.80 --> 6214.76]  running with the stupid motion smoothing so it looked like an absolute cluster it looked like absolutely
[6214.76 --> 6219.40]  nothing as all these birds are going across because the wings right they're they're constantly changing
[6219.40 --> 6226.52]  direction and when you've when you've got like uh you know i guess that would be what a 30 a 30 fps or
[6226.52 --> 6233.00]  24 fps content input and then you're trying to upscale it to you know at that time it would have been
[6233.00 --> 6241.80]  like 240 or whatever i mean it's a it's a gong show right it's not going to look like anything so stupid
[6241.80 --> 6250.36]  hate it um all right glad to hear it adam l love anno 1800 too i got the ink you got them all right
[6251.00 --> 6257.56]  so hopefully that clears things up for you a dracar one news mcdonald's japan is only serving small
[6257.56 --> 6261.72]  sized fries due to an issue with their canadian supplier in the vancouver ports yeah that sounds
[6261.72 --> 6267.48]  familiar thought it was fun enough to share hey thanks for that uh red robin locally is only providing
[6267.48 --> 6272.60]  ketchup in pre-portioned little things because apparently there's a ketchup shortage in vancouver
[6272.60 --> 6277.80]  now as well just just you know covet era things right so one of the incoming messages that i sent
[6277.80 --> 6282.04]  through so that they work at a chick-fil-a and they rotate through eight ipads for taking orders
[6282.04 --> 6288.12]  or something and they're wanting a charging solution just get one of those like uh file folder slot
[6288.12 --> 6292.44]  things that you can place them on and just plug them in there's there's not really much else to say
[6292.44 --> 6296.44]  other than that ind says you've mentioned software videos don't perform well would you consider
[6296.44 --> 6301.56]  making compilation videos of cool slash niche software for pc users it's something we've
[6301.56 --> 6307.32]  touched on before in fact we had a whole series that we had planned around it called lsd luke's
[6307.32 --> 6312.44]  software discoveries um it didn't perform very well i don't think luke did a great job of it
[6313.24 --> 6319.80]  i think one of them was okay yeah there was only like two of them yeah one of the problems is there
[6319.80 --> 6325.96]  honestly isn't that much stuff well i mean we did a full episode on nigh night for ncix tech tips that was
[6325.96 --> 6331.08]  a way back in the house a long time ago nigh night's still super cool by the way um yeah it's
[6331.08 --> 6335.00]  something that we could do in the meantime we can at least highlight the one that you mentioned here
[6335.00 --> 6339.80]  apparently it's a good way to force old games into windowed full screen called game companion
[6339.80 --> 6346.36]  but that sounds kind of neat it is it's not enough for one video and it's very niche yeah yep it's tough
[6346.36 --> 6352.28]  and ultimately when you like unless unless we started doing more linux stuff um i don't think there's
[6352.28 --> 6358.04]  enough of that type of content for windows i think if you jumped on linux yeah there there almost
[6358.04 --> 6365.16]  certainly would be um andrew c have either of you done any more linux things since the linux challenge
[6365.72 --> 6376.68]  nope i've been playing halo infinite mint released a new version uh i'm interested in trying it but i can't
[6376.68 --> 6383.08]  like this is the same problem they ran into last time i really really wanted to run it on my work
[6383.08 --> 6389.08]  computer a bunch of years ago and it just wasn't worth it now i really wanted to run it on my work
[6389.08 --> 6394.68]  laptop and it was totally worth it i actually significantly enjoyed the experience and i believe
[6394.68 --> 6400.28]  i was faster and more productive on linux than i was on windows because the startup time was really fast
[6400.28 --> 6406.68]  fast and it just didn't get in my way it was it was quick like i don't know i was happy and then it
[6406.68 --> 6411.48]  stopped displaying to an external monitor and i was just like okay now i need to waste a bunch of time
[6412.12 --> 6416.76]  installing windows again because windows takes a billion years to install compared to linux kind of
[6416.76 --> 6420.76]  does i don't get it it's only like four point however many gigabytes how long could it possibly
[6420.76 --> 6425.40]  take to extract and put all the files linux actually takes like a few minutes like i just and
[6425.40 --> 6430.76]  there's like almost no config you need to do i shouldn't say generally but like mint and ubuntu
[6430.76 --> 6435.64]  are super super fast to install it very very easy and then windows is like oh my god i have to click
[6435.64 --> 6439.72]  10 million things saying no i don't actually want you to take every single piece of information about
[6439.72 --> 6445.08]  my entire soul for free um and then you finally get into the install and it has to update 10 billion
[6445.08 --> 6450.60]  things as well so frustrating and i don't even want to use it and it's worse but at least it displays to
[6450.60 --> 6456.84]  a second monitor yep i don't know what to tell you so i don't know i i like want to try the new
[6456.84 --> 6463.32]  version of mint but if that happens again then i just wasted a bunch of time silver home says still
[6463.32 --> 6477.64]  no qd oled talk so ah that video did you watch the video we did on qd oled uh no okay it's super cool so
[6477.64 --> 6485.64]  samsung is trying to solve the problems of lcd and oled by basically combining some of the best
[6485.64 --> 6492.84]  technology of both they've got an oled backlight which basically means per pixel light control and
[6492.84 --> 6498.20]  then they're using a quantum dot layer to handle the transformation from the wavelength of light that
[6498.20 --> 6504.76]  the backlight evenly distributes to whatever wavelength they need so it's going to be your red green blue
[6504.76 --> 6508.44]  etc it's a little bit more complicated than that you get to watch the full video for the actual
[6508.44 --> 6512.68]  explanation because there's some pastor or something anyway the point is it's oled plus
[6512.68 --> 6519.64]  quantum dot and it's super cool a fair number of people criticized the videos for being extremely
[6519.64 --> 6526.20]  shilly and the answer to how that happened is actually that i did not know it was sponsored
[6526.20 --> 6537.48]  so james was the one who actually went down to samsung's demo everything i heard about it and i
[6537.48 --> 6544.44]  trust james's i trust james's takes on displays implicitly he he knows his biz um and he brought
[6544.44 --> 6549.88]  down all the tools he needed samsung let him play with them which was amazing with what limited time he
[6549.88 --> 6554.60]  had he was able to actually like test them which is something that doesn't normally happen at a ces
[6554.60 --> 6559.96]  showcase like it was very open considering that it was samsung i think part of it is that it was
[6559.96 --> 6566.68]  samsung display not samsung electronics okay so super cool opportunity that we would have been crazy
[6566.68 --> 6573.32]  not to take so james is the one who went down there he came up he scripted the video i went through it
[6573.32 --> 6580.28]  with him and i was like how good is it and he's like it's great and i go okay well this seems kind of
[6580.28 --> 6586.36]  tepid like is it good or is it great he's like it's great and i go okay so let's go through crank it
[6586.36 --> 6592.68]  up yeah and i cranked i cranked it up a notch as i was standing on the set
[6594.76 --> 6601.80]  i found out hey this video this is a fully sponsored video and i went oh that's why it was tepid
[6601.80 --> 6609.24]  that's why well no that's not why i i don't know why james made the decision because he would have
[6609.24 --> 6614.76]  had every opportunity to tell me in script review that right it was sponsored and that's why he did
[6614.76 --> 6618.84]  it but i mean i never asked right he might have assumed he must have assumed that i knew it was
[6618.84 --> 6623.08]  sponsored because someone told me at some point i'm just a scatterbrain i've got a lot going on and
[6623.08 --> 6630.52]  i i didn't remember i i just didn't remember and so i realize on set i find out on set hey this is
[6630.52 --> 6635.64]  a sponsor i go oh shoot okay so a couple of problems here number one is the way that i went
[6635.64 --> 6643.32]  through and edited that script for what is a forward-looking piece uh on a technology that is
[6643.32 --> 6652.92]  not released to the market yet for a brand partner is is not the way that i would normally um frame
[6652.92 --> 6658.84]  something like that i would normally frame it as more we're gonna let you guys be the judge of this
[6658.84 --> 6665.88]  ultimately but here's what samsung says about it so i allowed a lot more of our editorial impressions
[6665.88 --> 6671.96]  which were very positive to make their way into the finished video that was concern number one
[6671.96 --> 6681.24]  concern number two was that there was no sponsorship disclosure in the script oh so on set i ad-libbed in
[6681.24 --> 6684.76]  the sponsorship disclosure that needs to be in the first 30 seconds or whatever
[6684.76 --> 6691.40]  and i was just like well we're we're behind on production right now we need this out in time
[6691.40 --> 6698.60]  for it to go up at embargo um i don't have time to sit down and completely retool this script
[6698.60 --> 6704.28]  and make it less enthusiastic and the reality of it is people are going to see this tech they're going to
[6704.28 --> 6710.76]  know we were right about it anyway so how much damage is this going to do in the short term yeah i think
[6710.76 --> 6715.72]  it was a hit in the long term i think we come out fine because when people look at this two years or
[6715.72 --> 6721.08]  three years down the road they're going to be like ltt was right which which is which is great but it
[6721.08 --> 6726.36]  just it just sucks that we ended up with a lot of really negative comments on that video criticizing us
[6726.36 --> 6733.00]  for uh sort of shilling it when the reality of it is what actually happened was we ended up being
[6733.80 --> 6738.84]  way more positive than we normally would have been on a sponsored video because i didn't realize it was
[6738.84 --> 6746.76]  sponsored we actually go out of our way sometimes with sponsors to make sure that we don't we we don't
[6746.76 --> 6754.84]  inject that personal enthusiasm into it because we know that that muddies the waters um so that's
[6754.84 --> 6763.88]  what happened and um you know that's the kind of thing that i guess will end up in in my tell all uh yeah
[6768.84 --> 6776.60]  uh thomas w oh i've got some things to address um two two comments i'm not surprised to uh you know
[6776.60 --> 6782.44]  comments about linux stuff uh powder linux said couldn't luke get anthony to fix his second monitor
[6782.44 --> 6788.92]  issues now we're wasting two people's time the whole am i paying for this time exactly yeah is that a
[6788.92 --> 6795.00]  thing i'm paying for yeah like come on guys the the whole problem is that it's a it's a low-end work
[6795.00 --> 6802.52]  environment all i need is some browsers and two dedicated chat applications that's it i need slack
[6802.52 --> 6807.40]  i need teams and i need usually two to three browsers because i might need to test some things in some
[6807.40 --> 6815.88]  browsers whatever i just need it to work consistently that is my whole benchmark i was excited about using
[6815.88 --> 6821.16]  linux because it was a little bit faster i found it got in my way a little bit less so i could work
[6821.16 --> 6829.24]  slightly very marginally faster um the fact that it stopped displaying to a second monitor was a big
[6829.24 --> 6835.64]  problem and then crobat on twitch said i'm i'm not using mint but i am on fedora watching wancho on my
[6835.64 --> 6843.08]  laptop connected to a second monitor luke i know it's not that you can't do it i mean i had my manjaro
[6843.08 --> 6847.32]  rig on a second monitor whenever i needed to like diagnose a problem and i had it on a second monitor for
[6847.32 --> 6852.52]  like a month and i seriously doubt it affected almost anyone else if anyone else at all it's very likely
[6852.52 --> 6859.48]  related to my literally physically falling apart old razer laptop it's like it's it's it doesn't matter
[6859.48 --> 6864.68]  can you complain about that gift some more it's really it's really sexy when you do that it's still working
[6867.00 --> 6873.48]  i don't care i'm just it's still working it still plays games i went to a land with it uh at my parents
[6873.48 --> 6878.60]  house with my brother i'm kidding it's fine i know they all fell apart i understand we literally made
[6878.60 --> 6883.08]  a video about how they all fell apart i'm just saying it's probably more related to that than
[6883.08 --> 6888.84]  than like linux or whatever i wasn't trying to take shots at linux but it doesn't matter yeah i need it
[6888.84 --> 6893.96]  to work you don't want to take shots at linux when you can take shots at linus and his gift he gave you
[6895.96 --> 6900.84]  but it's just like and then there was another comment that was like hey linus uh you constantly get
[6900.84 --> 6905.56]  asked to make more unread content but you say there isn't enough interest but we're constantly
[6905.56 --> 6910.76]  asking you so there has to be enough interest and it's like no that's not how it works yeah no that's
[6910.76 --> 6914.12]  not how it works just because there's like a few loud people in the audience doesn't mean there's
[6914.12 --> 6919.40]  actually hundreds of thousands or at least a million people yeah i want to click on this content if we
[6919.40 --> 6923.80]  make a video that doesn't get a million views it's like a catastrophe to put it in perspective like
[6923.80 --> 6927.96]  what kind of scale we're hoping to operate on these days and we could potentially do a linux channel
[6927.96 --> 6932.92]  that has lower expectations at some point but we haven't done that yet uh thomas w asks what's
[6932.92 --> 6939.80]  the lowest temperature that the water bottle can handle could you put ln2 in it i don't know but you
[6939.80 --> 6945.48]  know who does know is steve from gamers nexus so you could ask him um i he told me he intended he
[6945.48 --> 6950.84]  he asked for some so we sent him some he told me he intended to use them for ln2 pouring for extreme
[6950.84 --> 6955.48]  overclocking i was like well let me know how it goes and i don't think i ever heard back from him so okay
[6955.48 --> 6962.04]  yeah feel free to um check check in with him about that kaira says hey luke what's your end game
[6962.04 --> 6966.52]  vision for floatplane i super love floatplane but things like caption availability make it hard for
[6966.52 --> 6971.88]  my auditory processing issues so unfortunately i usually use youtube despite being subscribed we do
[6971.88 --> 6978.36]  want to have to support auto caption stuff is there like an open open there's a service we can
[6978.36 --> 6983.00]  detections scribe to i believe the last time i looked into it it looked like it was a paid service it
[6983.00 --> 6989.00]  was uh attainably priced the problem was it it does if i remember correctly it's been a while the
[6989.00 --> 6992.68]  problem was that it didn't work with our current player we're still waiting for that player update
[6992.68 --> 6997.80]  i know i've been saying this for a while now we had our main developer in general also the main
[6997.80 --> 7004.68]  developer on the player uh kind of was down and out with covet for like a month um and he's only been
[7004.68 --> 7009.88]  back for like a week um he's done an amazing amount of stuff since he's back because he's awesome but
[7012.68 --> 7015.96]  he gets pulled in like a billion different directions and he's the one making the player so
[7016.84 --> 7021.88]  it'll come when it comes hopefully soon it's very close to being ready but we want it to be really
[7021.88 --> 7027.00]  really ready um it will not automatically support that but theoretically it would be able to support
[7027.00 --> 7030.68]  that and that is something that we want to do because you're definitely not the only person
[7030.68 --> 7038.04]  um who who needs slash wants that feature and we would like to support people with those types of
[7038.04 --> 7043.24]  needs slash wants mythx plays says miss the wan hoodie happy to be here for the wan pants linus i know you
[7043.24 --> 7048.12]  play badminton but what's your workout routine like is there a sweet high-tech gym coming at the new house no
[7048.12 --> 7056.12]  i actually do not do any pure working out the only exercise like explicit exercise that i do is playing
[7056.12 --> 7066.12]  badminton more formally training badminton and um beat saber that's actually it uh in general though
[7066.76 --> 7072.76]  and this is one of those things that it's it's ridiculous how how simple it is and yet how important
[7072.76 --> 7081.72]  it is i take steps two at a time i i walk fast everywhere i go i park farther away um take the difficult
[7081.72 --> 7089.72]  road there's there's a lot of little things that you can do that contribute to just you know i'm not
[7089.72 --> 7095.08]  jacked obviously like i'm not i'm not huge or anything but there's a lot of little things that
[7095.08 --> 7102.28]  you can do to do to help maintain what's what's shaken um you know like i i never miss a step target
[7102.28 --> 7109.08]  i'm always walking if i could if i could i am someone right in the office and knowing that it usually
[7109.08 --> 7115.32]  takes people a while to see it it's actually faster in most cases to get off your butt walk
[7115.32 --> 7120.52]  over to their desk and talk to them so that's what i do i get up and i go talk to people um and
[7120.52 --> 7125.08]  often it's nice to have a brain break it's good for the mind to just get your body moving once in
[7125.08 --> 7130.60]  a while genuinely yeah um so there's just a thousand little things like that um you know one
[7130.60 --> 7134.92]  of the things that i will go out of my way to do even if i don't feel like it is if my kids ask me
[7134.92 --> 7141.72]  to play a really active game like they like this game where i will i will go and catch them i will
[7141.72 --> 7148.44]  chase them like run after them scoop them up and then carry them like flailing around and throw them
[7148.44 --> 7154.12]  onto a bed or a couch okay and so they'll they'll go and they'll they'll hide or they'll run they'll try
[7154.12 --> 7159.48]  and get past me i was playing it at the in-laws house the other night with them freaking exhausting
[7159.48 --> 7165.08]  because like my oldest is nine yeah okay and he he loves it too they all they all love it so so
[7165.08 --> 7168.68]  i'll grab them and i'll like huck them onto the bed and i'll tickle them and then i'll run and i'll
[7168.68 --> 7173.64]  like go get another one and like throw them over my shoulder and go run somewhere else and like
[7173.64 --> 7177.96]  huck them on to huck them onto the bed and i'll like tickle them and one of them will come up behind
[7177.96 --> 7182.68]  me and like punch me in the butt and i'll turn around and grab them and i'll like put them over my
[7182.68 --> 7186.60]  head and like carry them off somewhere and throw them obviously you gotta be like careful there's yeah
[7186.60 --> 7192.52]  there's their children but i do like to play rough with my kids so that's something that's uh you know
[7192.52 --> 7198.52]  it's just one of the little things that when you have an opportunity take it and it makes a big
[7198.52 --> 7209.64]  difference yeah um um and i go hard at badminton to be very clear badminton if you are and i don't want
[7209.64 --> 7215.80]  to generalize but if you are white and not from denmark badminton is probably not what you think it is
[7216.60 --> 7227.16]  i'm just i'm just saying i play like for realsies so it's it's it's hard it's very intense
[7227.80 --> 7233.48]  people don't respect badminton enough um men singles badminton like the average professional
[7233.48 --> 7238.44]  match they actually travel a greater distance in less time compared to professional tennis matches
[7238.44 --> 7245.96]  like it's it's pretty crazy it's insane yeah um burned to otis with samsung now making oled tvs
[7245.96 --> 7251.56]  will lg oleds get cheaper i suspect it'll put pressure on lg um and will lg finally make an
[7251.56 --> 7257.16]  oled gaming monitor panel well lg would need an appropriate technology to do it that's the issue
[7257.16 --> 7263.88]  right now i think one of the reasons they only have an oled creator monitor is that they can sell
[7263.88 --> 7271.00]  it at the kinds of margins that will allow them to uh absorb any returned panels due to burn in
[7271.00 --> 7276.84]  if it becomes a problem out in the field so i uh i don't think it's i don't think it's coming
[7276.84 --> 7282.04]  anytime soon but don't quote me on that i mean they could surprise me um they don't they have a
[7282.04 --> 7287.16]  30 don't they have a 42 inch tv coming though i mean that's getting dangerously close to monitor
[7287.16 --> 7291.40]  size at this point yeah i mean i'm already using a 48 inch as a monitor and i'm i'm kind of loving it
[7291.40 --> 7297.32]  actually i don't know how i could go back there's one for me from jacob w says hey luke how have you
[7297.32 --> 7302.36]  been now that you've been on the floatplane team for a while how does it feel not working for ltt
[7302.36 --> 7308.52]  anymore what was the transition between the two like blah blah blah it's it's cool i i've worked a
[7308.52 --> 7313.40]  lot of jobs in my life sometimes i miss making videos but sometimes i also miss working in the
[7313.40 --> 7318.04]  back of geek squad and fixing computers i like it's you're there's going to be positives and negatives
[7318.04 --> 7323.48]  about everything there was a moment that i i kind of there's there's been times in my life where i've
[7323.48 --> 7328.76]  tried to sit and absorb and accept uh accept the fact that i'm currently in the good old days
[7329.40 --> 7336.60]  i try to like recognize that when i'm in it so that i can more deeply enjoy things and honestly
[7338.04 --> 7343.40]  this week when when the garbage time stream went live dank pods when he went live and he started
[7343.40 --> 7348.92]  playing drums on stream and the stream was running beautifully and the whole live chat was freaking
[7348.92 --> 7354.68]  out about how good the audio quality was and i was i had just previously been sitting in a voice chat
[7354.68 --> 7358.76]  with all the people that contributed and made this thing happen i was watching it happen in front of
[7358.76 --> 7362.60]  my eyes and he's talking about how great the stream's running everything's just going properly
[7362.60 --> 7370.12]  and i'm just sitting there like this is pretty bleep button cool like the fact that we made this is just
[7370.12 --> 7377.16]  kind of incredible like it's it's this is this is a wild achievement i think everyone on the team
[7377.16 --> 7382.36]  should be incredibly proud and i'm incredibly proud of them um and this is not something that i could
[7382.36 --> 7388.44]  have done in in any other arena so i mean you can count on your hands and toes uh on your fingers and
[7388.44 --> 7394.84]  toes probably like the companies in the world that have their own top to bottom um
[7394.84 --> 7402.28]  um vaude delivery systems right yeah like it's it's and a lot of the information for that is is not
[7402.28 --> 7406.52]  the most public and stuff like it's it's genuinely incredible what the team has done and every once in
[7406.52 --> 7411.24]  a while i just have to sit back and be like wow like this is crazy like obviously there's things that
[7411.24 --> 7416.36]  full point doesn't do perfectly but there's enough that it does really well that i just i think it's super
[7416.36 --> 7421.40]  cool and i also appreciate that i'm allowed to still do stuff like this i've been doing wancho the entire
[7421.40 --> 7429.72]  time um it's not like i've been completely gone um i just don't make mainline videos anymore but it was
[7429.72 --> 7433.80]  nice to have you back for the linux series it was fun yeah fun working together on the videos again i
[7433.80 --> 7439.16]  completely agree and i've talked to riley i'm probably going to be doing a a tech link yeah so that's cool
[7439.16 --> 7445.72]  but but i'm not by no means am i leaving flow planes so don't get it twisted i might just show up every
[7445.72 --> 7453.56]  once in a blue moon um but yeah i don't know i love my job it's really cool so yeah i don't actually
[7453.56 --> 7459.24]  force him to say that just to be very clear no and i don't think he'd be afraid to say it no i i typed
[7459.24 --> 7465.08]  a comment in the in the garbage time stream i typed a comment being like this is the fact that i like
[7465.08 --> 7470.04]  that part of my job is that i need to sit here and make sure the stream goes well it's so freaking cool
[7470.04 --> 7476.04]  because i'm like this is awesome i don't know it was it was great i uh yeah jake asks anno after
[7476.04 --> 7483.48]  party i'm tired i'm out tonight but i'm i'm definitely down i'm down to play some nano yeah
[7483.48 --> 7489.08]  we should we should um saxon asks any chance for a rough date pre-save link or subscribe to notify for
[7489.08 --> 7497.96]  the new short circuit hoodie even if it's in like 2024 um we have no such feature at this time but um
[7498.60 --> 7503.48]  we've kind of we've thought about it it could be an interesting idea to add like a page of like
[7503.48 --> 7506.52]  upcoming products that you can subscribe to notifications for or something but it's also
[7506.52 --> 7511.08]  fun to just drop them and during wanshow and we have enough of that one coming that as long as you're
[7511.08 --> 7515.08]  kind of paying attention to the channel at least once a week i think you'll get one then again the
[7515.08 --> 7521.64]  response to that thing has been absolute fire so i i there's no guarantee we got to start firing
[7521.64 --> 7527.32]  through these okay fire because i'm like out of time okay uh kenneth love the new house content if you're
[7527.32 --> 7531.64]  curious if you plan to review any new security products no and for the reasons that you outlined
[7531.64 --> 7536.60]  it's very difficult to review a security product without revealing far more about your own security
[7536.60 --> 7541.64]  situation than you are comfortable with uh zach m i already have and love the desk pad water bottle
[7541.64 --> 7545.80]  thanks for the amazing products i know the port's been a pain any idea when when hoodie oh okay no we
[7545.80 --> 7549.48]  already addressed that yeah it's coming in float plane chat says can we give a shout out to the linux
[7549.48 --> 7554.28]  one i could hasn't crashed once this is a void hashtag f windows yeah infrastructure
[7554.28 --> 7560.28]  developments heck yeah let's go pretty much michael o um is there any idea when we might start seeing
[7561.00 --> 7565.40]  research testing and content coming out of the labs will it be in 2022 or is that wishful thinking
[7565.96 --> 7572.68]  if it's not in 2022 i'll be disappointed anonymous any plans to tackle the chaos that is shopping for an
[7572.68 --> 7578.12]  av receiver that actually supports everything that hdmi 2.1 is supposed to offer on multiple inputs
[7578.12 --> 7584.44]  that would be a project for the lab that's not a project for our ltt writing team so expect that to
[7584.44 --> 7589.48]  take some time bill long time of your serious question if we have big suggestions for the lab
[7589.48 --> 7595.16]  and float plane where is the suggestion box we do have a publicly facing email address on the main channel
[7595.16 --> 7603.80]  i'd say that's not a bad place to send real valid meaningful feedback um but don't expect a reply the the
[7603.80 --> 7610.68]  the folks who man that are not um they're not gonna reply to you uh evan loving the merch can we get
[7610.68 --> 7614.92]  subtitles on the product photo showing what size the model is wearing we are working on it that is a
[7614.92 --> 7621.56]  thing that we will do it's just a matter of them getting on it um luke o says haven't asked this in a
[7621.56 --> 7627.64]  couple years when can i buy your book linus and can i get an autographed copy of this autobiography
[7627.64 --> 7632.28]  i don't think i have a good enough memory to write an autobiography i think if i ended up writing a
[7632.28 --> 7638.60]  book it would basically just be me sitting down and typing and rambling until i run out of things
[7638.60 --> 7647.48]  to ramble about and then binding it and selling it right linus sebastian yeah exactly um yeah pretty much
[7648.92 --> 7653.32]  uh alec asks hey what's the time frame on the backpack three months a year should i stop checking
[7653.32 --> 7659.00]  for it every few days stop checking for it every few days you'll know because it'll be on when we still
[7659.00 --> 7665.16]  have another sample coming i think next week if this one is perfect then it goes into production
[7665.16 --> 7672.20]  and it will be months away okay if it's not perfect chinese new year's happening could be another two
[7672.20 --> 7678.84]  months before we even get another sample so uh joseph g says i'm autistic and have sensory issues and the
[7678.84 --> 7683.96]  short circuit long sleeve t-shirt is out of stock are there any more long sleeves in the pipeline or a
[7683.96 --> 7687.64]  restock for the short circuit okay there are long sleeves in the pipeline but they're going to be a
[7687.64 --> 7692.60]  while they're going to be based on the same fabric as our t-shirts or maybe a slightly heavier weight
[7692.60 --> 7696.76]  and those are still going through that process where we're deploying them making sure they're
[7696.76 --> 7704.84]  all good and then we're going to ramp up big time uh anonymous are the swag gets getting a restock or
[7704.84 --> 7709.72]  were there a limited time item they are getting a restock this time the first swag it only got a
[7709.72 --> 7714.68]  single stocking because we had issues with qc on that with that supplier and we couldn't find
[7714.68 --> 7718.44]  another supplier to build it blah blah blah blah blah long story but this one is coming back
[7719.48 --> 7726.76]  um how about dark aqua pants yeah um that sounds like a great idea um you know hit up hit up nick
[7726.76 --> 7730.84]  if you have merch suggestions don't bother him on the weekend though we can skip this one already
[7730.84 --> 7735.32]  talked about it uh okay uh britney hope you guys are having a great night been waiting for the pants
[7735.32 --> 7740.20]  to drop i get it i'm so excited to finally get them also i don't know if you'll see or read this but if
[7740.20 --> 7744.60]  you do how do you guys feel about razor snecky merch have you gotten any of it for yourselves i
[7744.60 --> 7752.28]  didn't know what they were talking about um well i'm gonna google it razor razor snecky snecky
[7752.28 --> 7758.04]  sneck what is this it's a snake i mean it's cute
[7758.04 --> 7768.20]  it's pretty cute um giving cuddles aiding conservation chief gaming mascot meets necky
[7768.20 --> 7772.04]  snack i mean it's not the weirdest thing razors ever done
[7777.80 --> 7783.96]  uh no i haven't gotten my hands on any of that stuff myself um adam c says can't wait to see more
[7783.96 --> 7787.96]  collared shirts maybe long sleeves too why don't you guys branch out into formal wear and make
[7787.96 --> 7795.48]  a tie maybe gpu oh i hate you so much loot maybe gpu themed you could call it the 3090 tie
[7796.60 --> 7801.48]  it's actually not that stupid that's the one where i was i i reacted and you were like what and i was
[7801.48 --> 7812.12]  like you'll see it later that was it by the way ah the 3090 tie oh man jaden in full plane chat i
[7812.12 --> 7821.56]  actually kind of want one pretty good so that gets a little bit complicated because like that would
[7821.56 --> 7826.28]  absolutely be trademarked we'd have to find a way what if you beat them to the punch around 40 90 tie
[7827.08 --> 7835.32]  that's hilarious and then we just mock up like kind of uh what it might look like man
[7835.32 --> 7845.80]  oh my goodness okay all right uh you got my attention you got my attention that's a legit good
[7845.80 --> 7854.12]  idea um ryan got the shirt to commemorate my first computer repair at work i now run it for my office
[7854.12 --> 7860.20]  quite the journey looking to upgrade our workstations next would you go intel 11th gen or would you go 12th
[7860.20 --> 7865.56]  gen for future proofing so 11th gen would be tried and true 12th gen would be man 12th gen performs so
[7865.56 --> 7871.24]  much better um man i'd be real tempted to go 12th gen right now to be perfectly honest with you it's
[7871.24 --> 7880.20]  just it's just better daniel h asks there's a sony fw 900 crt you probably heard before that does high
[7880.20 --> 7885.32]  res high refresh rate gaming sure does be interested in doing a blind a b testing against modern high
[7885.32 --> 7892.76]  refresh rate sure i'll bounty the fw 900 if someone has one that i we could reasonably get to vancouver canada
[7893.32 --> 7899.72]  i i am down i would love to have one of those in our arsenal so man what are what are they worth
[7899.72 --> 7904.60]  though tell you what why don't you hit me up with your offers same thing we've got the public facing
[7904.60 --> 7910.12]  email it ain't that hard to find on the youtube channel if you have an fw 900 i'm into it
[7910.12 --> 7916.84]  um hey linus opposite side of the question how does it feel not having luke working in ltt videos
[7916.84 --> 7921.48]  anymore has having your own personal vod dev on staff been more helpful than losing a host love
[7921.48 --> 7929.48]  what you do um honestly what floatplane does now is incredibly valuable so between the floatplane.com
[7929.48 --> 7934.92]  platform um i mean you guys saw in the how does lmg make money video that we did a while back it is a
[7934.92 --> 7940.04]  significant portion of our annual revenue and then now they're doing stuff like merch messages which
[7940.76 --> 7945.80]  quite frankly if it goes the way that i'm expecting it to this year i would expect
[7946.60 --> 7953.24]  the merch message revenue to outstrip the floatplane subscription revenue for 2020 there's a lot to
[7953.24 --> 7960.44]  unpack there because there is because the floatplane revenue is cash and the merch messages revenue is
[7960.44 --> 7966.52]  is based on creator warehouse work and and has costs the merch messages income on a week where there is
[7966.52 --> 7970.36]  a product launch versus a week that there isn't a product launch is like completely night and day and
[7970.36 --> 7975.48]  stuff but but yeah building tools like that building tools that are going to help us build out the lab
[7975.48 --> 7980.36]  make the content better i think is where the floatplane team is really going to be able to shine
[7980.36 --> 7986.28]  over the next year and the inventory system and yeah we have we have like a fully customized inventory
[7986.28 --> 7992.12]  system now instead of the garbage software that we were using before that's all on the floatplane team so i
[7992.12 --> 7998.92]  think it's more valuable having an in-house dev team than it is and having someone in charge of
[7998.92 --> 8004.12]  it who understands what we do because i could try to hire someone for luke's position but realistically
[8004.12 --> 8009.00]  they would not understand what we do and you guys as viewers who have followed us for many years you
[8009.00 --> 8015.88]  might take it for granted but it's not just straightforward it's not just you walk into this job and
[8015.88 --> 8021.08]  immediately you're like oh yeah this is this is where the revenue comes from and this is who the
[8021.08 --> 8028.60]  customers are like it's not that simple because what we do is creative it's not just plugging in inputs
[8028.60 --> 8037.32]  and getting outputs so um yeah it's it's i i wouldn't have anyone else doing it quite frankly thanks man
[8037.32 --> 8042.44]  a prime said you want to license that out we've thought about it we want there's there's still work to be
[8042.44 --> 8046.52]  done to finish custom tailoring like there's there's a thing we're doing and for product
[8046.52 --> 8052.36]  procurement where instead of it going through this like weird google sheet and then being added to an
[8052.36 --> 8056.68]  email and all this weird stuff we're going to track the entire procurement process through the inventory
[8056.68 --> 8060.76]  system oh that's cool there's always the item there and a notification can be sent out once that
[8060.76 --> 8065.24]  item actually shows up in office to one of the writers and stuff so there's still like features and
[8065.24 --> 8070.36]  things that we want to bring to the table um once we're done the core development and you guys are like
[8070.36 --> 8074.52]  yeah we just kind of like it now then we might look into potentially licensing out but it's going
[8074.52 --> 8082.28]  to be so tailored to us that it's like unless you're a youtube outfit that has a massive inventory
[8082.28 --> 8086.28]  which there's probably very few of you but there are some gamers nexus yeah there's going to be
[8086.28 --> 8094.20]  license it to steve yeah this could be like hey steve a small my digits sup but yeah i don't know um
[8094.20 --> 8101.80]  um asa yes we're working on daw benchmarks it's taking a long time mechanical v i am shorter than
[8101.80 --> 8106.12]  all the options for the lance i'm just over five feet would you recommend this for a short woman or
[8106.12 --> 8114.84]  should i hold off hold off for the women's cuts because they are going to be like more more fitted for
[8114.84 --> 8122.92]  narrower legs um in addition to being better for height um yvonne tried one of the men's fit ones and she
[8122.92 --> 8128.28]  was just like this is a little too big for me she is extremely skinny though so your mileage may vary
[8128.28 --> 8132.28]  but i would say that there's a solid chance that you're going to be better off waiting for the
[8132.28 --> 8137.80]  women's version uh matthew h i have the gpu and controller foil shirts when are we getting new foil
[8137.80 --> 8147.96]  shirts no time soon um yeah we haven't we've kind of moved on to new metas at this point uh solar fervor
[8147.96 --> 8152.20]  says just saw mkbhd's what's in my bag your team has a lot of camera enthusiasts would you guys ever
[8152.20 --> 8160.76]  consider making a camera focused backpack no that is not in the plan at all um it's something that we
[8160.76 --> 8166.60]  could potentially tackle but it's also something that we would just love to see people who live and
[8166.60 --> 8171.72]  breathe it every day tackle like that's what makes this thing so great is that it is tech enthusiast
[8171.72 --> 8178.52]  focus there's thought given to where does my mouse go most people don't carry a mouse i do i need
[8178.52 --> 8186.76]  somewhere to put my gd mouse okay um and so we want to really just stick to products where we can
[8186.76 --> 8192.52]  differentiate based on that we do use them every day and that we have pain points that we can really
[8192.52 --> 8197.80]  meaningfully address uh turf asks linus are you liking the samsung watch or going back to the apple watch
[8197.80 --> 8203.40]  need a lengthy video or more details um frankly i just use it as a watch i use it to tell the time
[8203.40 --> 8210.20]  the notification delivery on my phone for calendar events is so inconsistent and unreliable that i just
[8211.00 --> 8217.16]  i can't um really use it for that and reminders on android are so fundamentally broken if anyone who
[8217.16 --> 8221.80]  works on android ever wanted to talk to me about how atrocious reminders are i'd be happy to point them
[8221.80 --> 8228.44]  in the right direction about how to fix them um when i say remind me of something i don't mean be like
[8229.88 --> 8237.56]  you might want to know this i mean remind me i need to do it and there's no way to change your reminder
[8237.56 --> 8245.56]  notification to be a continuous alarm how is that even possible it is 2022 yeah how is it even possible
[8245.56 --> 8253.16]  that you can't set a persist a persistent reminder it's mind-blowing anyway that's a whole that's a
[8253.16 --> 8260.04]  whole thing so um as a time piece to tell the time i think it works great it doesn't get stinky so the
[8260.04 --> 8265.32]  band is good in that sense it's good high quality wasn't really all my thoughts christopher m ltt
[8265.32 --> 8271.56]  shills for the win uh need more hoodies and swagkets for the full set epic pillow when i think it's in the
[8271.56 --> 8276.04]  harbor yes will there be a non-hoodie sweater in development that one could wear to work stealth
[8276.04 --> 8282.20]  sweater with a zipper front stay awesome ltt we do have a new stealth coming um it is a hoodie oh
[8282.20 --> 8288.92]  interesting yeah no i don't think man i just love hoodies um me too they're kind of definitely into
[8288.92 --> 8295.88]  hoodies a non-hoodie sweater i mean uh you know what i think we should do something like that that is
[8295.88 --> 8301.96]  a thing seems like a good idea a non-hooded sweater um well with a zipper right is what you
[8301.96 --> 8306.60]  say yeah you guys have a non-hooded sweater yeah yeah yeah yeah it's kind of it's really different
[8306.60 --> 8311.88]  though that's like a cozy warm kind of sweater yeah um non-hooded sweater with zipper i'm gonna just
[8311.88 --> 8316.28]  send that to nick with a maybe i mean once we've done the patterns and got the materials sourced it's
[8316.28 --> 8320.76]  just a matter that's a relatively simple thing that's one of the reasons that all of this has taken
[8320.76 --> 8327.32]  so long because everything we've done has been from freaking scratch once we've got good suppliers
[8327.32 --> 8335.24]  and like ah good material sourcing it's gonna get simpler i can we keep saying that and it just keeps
[8335.24 --> 8340.36]  staying complicated um i would like to make a store suggestion i work in retail and the policy is we
[8340.36 --> 8344.84]  cannot wear any sweaters with a hood or logos can you please consider making a sweater with a zipper but
[8344.84 --> 8349.96]  no hood wait it's the same damn suggestion but from a different person that's hilarious okay
[8350.52 --> 8357.56]  yeah we're still working on it um justin says dank is still doing this one and please visit ltt
[8358.60 --> 8365.24]  um and archive i didn't click that one i didn't i don't know where that one came from okay uh jared
[8365.24 --> 8371.64]  asks do you plan on adding microscopy microscopy i don't know equipment to the lab if yes do you plan
[8371.64 --> 8379.64]  to hire a microscopist microscopist to run it um anything's possible right now we are digging
[8379.64 --> 8385.88]  through literally hundreds of like masters and phd grade applicants it's kind of incredible
[8385.88 --> 8392.04]  and we're going to figure out what experts we have and we're going to build out test suites and
[8392.04 --> 8397.00]  equipment around them we're kind of going very backwards but that's the that's the reality of
[8397.00 --> 8402.28]  it when you go in with no real solid plan and you just want to like make better videos yeah so yeah
[8402.28 --> 8404.20]  um we're gonna we're gonna take what we can get
[8404.92 --> 8408.52]  ben d says just built my first computer this week currently watching on it thanks for all
[8408.52 --> 8411.80]  the educational content when is your beat saver competition with conrad coming
[8412.44 --> 8419.64]  any time conrad any time i think i think you got to put a cap on it fine this month it's been at
[8419.64 --> 8426.04]  least new year's resolution come at me bro yeah what do you think of that uh jacob w question for
[8426.04 --> 8429.88]  linus and luke you guys been doing this a long time looking back what's your favorite and worst
[8429.88 --> 8436.44]  memories of working together well we did the worst uh a couple weeks ago i think favorite man
[8440.76 --> 8445.88]  i mean there's it's been a wild ride it's been a long we've done some crazy stuff
[8447.64 --> 8452.84]  i don't know yeah what have we not done i mean staying up late at computex just like talking about
[8452.84 --> 8458.76]  stuff being on the top of the mountain man like we've done a lot of cool stuff lately but i think a lot
[8458.76 --> 8462.60]  of the founding memories are going to be pretty core for a long time yeah i've brought this one
[8462.60 --> 8468.60]  up quite a few times i know the server falling asleep at the denny's yeah i don't know why but
[8468.60 --> 8475.48]  that one just sticks that's just such a that's a very coveted memory all the late night drives right
[8475.48 --> 8481.08]  like i used to just like drive luke everywhere i didn't have a car he had no car way past the bus and
[8481.08 --> 8486.04]  i knew he had no money yeah because ncix wasn't paying him any money so what was i gonna do just like
[8486.04 --> 8491.24]  leave the office and leave him there like walk home for like three hours i i think i pretty much
[8491.24 --> 8497.40]  saved your life that one time when i lent you that camo jacket or was that you or ed that was
[8497.40 --> 8503.00]  that was you honestly it's probably both of us for some reason he had to take the bus and it was like
[8503.00 --> 8508.12]  crazy cold and he only had a t-shirt so i like gave him my jacket yeah and then i had no jacket i
[8508.12 --> 8513.96]  didn't tell him i didn't tell him that i needed it did i ever tell you that i like needed it okay
[8513.96 --> 8520.84]  i i i know i borrowed that jacket when very needed more than once but i i'm pretty sure ed did it i lost
[8520.84 --> 8525.88]  it somehow i don't know what happened to it yeah i don't have it anymore it's just like crazy ridiculous
[8525.88 --> 8530.28]  camo jacket it was super thick favorite memory sports day yeah jake honestly i was thinking about
[8530.28 --> 8537.80]  that recently the second it's like we got to play some ball hockey sports day i want to play some
[8537.80 --> 8543.80]  ball hockey at the gym absolutely i'm super down yeah source some sticks and i'll just like order
[8543.80 --> 8548.68]  them i don't even care i have a stick yeah but we need more we've got to have like hockey ball hockey
[8548.68 --> 8553.72]  we got to play some ball hockey sure yeah all right uh last merch message here it is jeffrey a
[8553.72 --> 8558.28]  is it better to wait and upgrade to something like the lgc2 or should i just find a good deal on a c1
[8558.28 --> 8566.68]  equivalent honestly i mean c2 is looking brighter it's looking exciting but it's hard to go wrong
[8566.68 --> 8573.96]  man any any current gen oled is going to be such a game changer for probably whatever you're running now
[8573.96 --> 8579.40]  that you're gonna absolutely love it i gotta say jake said the sports day thing and then he said charity
[8579.40 --> 8589.96]  streams um i jake i have very recently dug out all of the footage of you and me screwing around
[8589.96 --> 8596.36]  making those christmas presents for my family uh i don't know what i'm gonna do with it i've been
[8596.36 --> 8600.76]  cutting it together it's not gonna go anywhere i i think i just want the video for myself like
[8600.76 --> 8606.84]  genuinely luke technically has a channel yeah i just there's a video of me saving him on the bridge
[8606.84 --> 8612.60]  which had zero dislikes until we pointed it out on my show and then it got some dislikes i was sad
[8612.60 --> 8619.48]  um but it is so funny i don't like i i'm watching this this really old footage of jake and i just like
[8619.48 --> 8625.48]  screwing around in the garage at like one in the morning making like stupid toilet humor jokes and it
[8625.48 --> 8632.84]  is so funny that i just watch it and then run out of time and have done almost no editing because i just
[8632.84 --> 8640.28]  find it hilarious i just keep watching and it's so much footage it's actually excessive and it's
[8640.28 --> 8644.44]  funny because i have no idea what i'm doing with cameras so anytime jake isn't there the footage is
[8644.44 --> 8651.32]  like basically unusable so it's basically just jake and i the whole time like half the time i filmed
[8651.32 --> 8657.80]  myself i didn't turn the mic on jake wants to see it yeah of course yeah why not yeah i have all it's so
[8657.80 --> 8663.80]  it's actually so funny i don't know uh junkie 81 asks is he allowed to upload it yeah of course
[8663.80 --> 8668.92]  one of the best parts is we have this bucket of cement that's dried out and i have to try to get
[8668.92 --> 8675.00]  the cement out of the bucket but it's like one in the morning so i'm trying to like hammer the cement
[8675.00 --> 8680.36]  out of this bucket and jake's telling me i'm not gonna be able to get it done and he's like oh man
[8680.36 --> 8684.28]  it's so funny oh man i want to watch this video it's actually hilarious
[8684.28 --> 8690.68]  i'll cut it together at some point it's a lot of footage so it's gonna take me like forever some of
[8690.68 --> 8696.44]  the early channel super fun stuff was pretty ridiculously fun too just oh man even just little
[8696.44 --> 8702.12]  dumb stuff like remember that time you chased me and i was like legit i had like a fight or flight
[8702.12 --> 8707.72]  reaction you jumped over somebody else's fence didn't you something like that just trying to get away
[8707.72 --> 8712.60]  from them yeah i remember that there's been a lot we've done we've done a lot of stuff it's been a
[8712.60 --> 8716.68]  good time it's been a long time all right and it's been a long time on this show i think it's
[8716.68 --> 8721.80]  time for us to call it oh my god someone said technically it still has no dislikes that's funny
[8721.80 --> 8727.24]  never thought about that thank you for tuning in we will see you guys again next week same bad time
[8727.24 --> 8729.16]  same bad channel bye
[8731.32 --> 8735.64]  jake said you should just edit into it i legitimately think at this point in time if i finish the edit it's
[8735.64 --> 8742.04]  gonna be like well over an hour long oh wow okay yeah because i don't care like i don't know if i'd
[8742.04 --> 8746.60]  even release it so it's not for like it's not really for other people i don't care if people keep
[8746.60 --> 8746.92]  watching
[8752.84 --> 8759.64]  oh wait i gotta end the stream uh bye
