[0.00 → 8.32] and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[8.32 → 17.36] ram bam thank you for the correction ma'am Guildford has stepped up to correct what i said on our prime
[17.36 → 24.22] day stream earlier, although frankly it probably wasn't necessary since we've got the one and only
[24.22 → 30.82] Ryan shroud and the equally one and equally only tom Peterson formerly of pc perspective and NVIDIA
[30.82 → 35.84] and now currently both at intel working on intel art graphics so they're going to be chatting about
[35.84 → 40.56] that that's one of our other main topics today what else we got Luke what are we going to talk
[40.56 → 44.00] about we're going to talk about some events that we're hosting that are coming up one of them being
[44.00 → 49.82] the land one of them being something you've never heard of before also unity acquires iron source an
[49.82 → 54.26] ad tech company what does that mean for games probably bad things you picked that probably
[54.26 → 58.82] horrible things i don't even want to talk about time to talk about bad stuff no it's horrible and i
[58.82 → 62.50] don't want to i refuse pick something else nope we're gonna talk about it
[62.50 → 73.30] i didn't know about that did that happen today
[79.82 → 89.92] the show is brought to you by Squarespace wealth front and axiom i think it makes sense to start
[89.92 → 97.12] with our first topic and you guys can weigh in okay so we've got Linus with his casual off the cuff
[97.12 → 106.42] comment on cast Latin cast latency versus uh actual uh ram frequency and the importance of
[106.42 → 111.84] trade-off trade-offs between them, and then we've in the other corner we've got Guildford with the um
[111.84 → 122.14] actually that's very important so i applied a very old very general very inaccurate rule of thumb when i
[122.14 → 128.32] said something along the lines of if you have a full okay well that's where we get into the nuance
[128.32 → 138.38] if you have a bin of speed versus a bin of latency one versus the other is probably about the same
[138.38 → 144.68] so if you were to go up one bin in megatransfers per second in your actual frequency while also
[144.68 → 150.64] increasing your latency by one bin then you's probably about the same as having a little less
[150.64 → 156.72] frequency and a little less latency was the generalization that i made and back in the ddr1 days
[156.72 → 166.62] that was probably a fairly fair thing to say these days it resulted in a video from Guildford correcting
[166.62 → 174.70] me because it is not actually accurate, so trout do you want to take a crack at what i got wrong before
[174.70 → 182.34] i no i i actually don't because uh, uh you know as we've gone from DDR through to four to now
[182.34 → 187.48] five like i wouldn't know how to equate the deltas you get from a latency jump and a frequency
[187.48 → 194.24] jump um i know there has to be some trade-off but uh you know this is the risk you take when you talk
[194.24 → 199.10] in a very public when you say anything when you say anything and i lived in that world i know what it's
[199.10 → 208.48] like to be uh corrected mildly in those ways what i said was that going from uh 5200 megatransfers per
[208.48 → 215.72] second cl40 down to 4800 megatransfers per second cl38 is probably a trade-off that isn't going to
[215.72 → 221.96] matter that much at the end of the day however this is not entirely true YouTuber actually hardware
[221.96 → 228.66] actually hardware actually hardcore overclocking aka Guildford released a video titled tech YouTubers need
[228.66 → 235.52] to stop all caps doing this when talking about ram where he provided us with this is editorialized
[235.52 → 241.26] I'm not the one who wrote this a minor correction regarding how we talk about ram because at the
[241.26 → 245.82] end of the day when we're talking about the decisions that you make regarding a large purchase
[245.82 → 252.80] like a gaming pc these little differences actually do matter because if you pick it's actually it's been
[252.80 → 260.78] a concept for a video I've wanted to do for a long time the optimal pc where in every
[260.78 → 268.56] component class where for every component you pick a worst in class component so you take so you know
[268.56 → 274.44] how you can have a thermal paste that will maybe drop help you shed three degrees sure which
[274.44 → 283.38] might help you turbo 0.25 percent more right so at every turn we pick the one that is five percent or
[283.38 → 290.12] three percent or one percent worse and then at every turn we take the component that is five percent or
[290.12 → 295.74] three percent or one percent better, and then we drag race those two against each other to actually talk
[295.74 → 301.90] about the importance of these little decisions at whether it's ram GPU motherboard i mean motherboard
[301.90 → 305.20] is one we hardly even talk about the performance differences between motherboards anymore
[305.20 → 312.98] why because it's all down to a couple of percents here and there but they stack yeah they stack and it
[312.98 → 319.06] matters i love that you took the smart path and said nothing which is what i should have but see
[319.06 → 323.70] but what i actually want to do is challenge tom because Tom has a lot of experience in under
[323.70 → 328.96] like i don't know if he does he was an inventor of a very important memory technology that we use
[328.96 → 334.26] every day every day so NVIDIA back in the day when i worked there i was in the chipset business
[334.26 → 340.14] first you were n-force i was n-force when it was good yeah or when it was bad before intel killed it
[340.14 → 346.70] i was in n-force yeah can I say that yeah and so part of that job uh we were trying to figure out
[346.70 → 351.98] how do you differentiate in chipsets versus intel which is hard right well you had GeForce MX which
[351.98 → 358.48] is actually how you guys sold me my first motherboard is that right i had a MX 440 so i could play warcraft
[358.48 → 366.58] 3 i didn't play any hardcore games but n-force 2 with GeForce MX i actually got a sol tech mRNA
[366.58 → 373.42] motherboard remember that golden flame motherboard and that was enough of a differentiator that i
[373.42 → 378.16] didn't want via i didn't want any of the other chipset makers for and i think sis was still in
[378.16 → 383.94] the business at the time yeah um and i went NVIDIA for GeForce MX graphics god bless you, and they sucked
[383.94 → 391.12] but god bless you, but they were so much better than intel's graphics oh wait at the time at the
[391.12 → 398.50] star i just took a real weird turn and that's my cue to exit gotta go so okay you were
[398.50 → 402.68] with the n-force yes okay tell me about all right so the know there's uh at the time we were good
[402.68 → 407.00] friends with corsair you know john Beasley i know him he's a great guy and Andy and all those guys and
[407.00 → 411.78] we're trying to figure out hey how can we partner closer with these guys, and we came up with a top a
[411.78 → 419.28] concept called EPP and SLI memory EPP stands for enhanced performance profiles yes intel called us and said
[419.28 → 424.76] good idea we want to get on board so they joined it and there was a little consortium that intel pushed
[424.76 → 437.16] to uh deck, and it became XMP so i really no shit yes i did not know that yes so cool i still have
[437.16 → 444.66] if you're AMD, although nobody calls it that i still have an original SLI memory dim that we did
[444.66 → 451.16] and it basically SLI branded memory had EPP now the SLI branded memory didn't last very long and some
[451.16 → 458.50] of it quite frankly no offence was dog it i remember there were these Oct ddr2 yes, yes SLI modules yes
[458.50 → 466.00] that were great atrocious unbelievably good the compatibility was unbelievably good we're we're
[466.00 → 470.84] fast forwarding a little bit in my career at that point so we're in the ddr2 phase I'm working at
[470.84 → 479.10] NCI as our uh as our coordinator for our high-end systems, and so i was actually the one whenever we
[479.10 → 484.86] got an order for like a 6 000 7 000 8 000 system i think the highest end one i ever built was like a
[484.86 → 490.14] 10 grand system and this was without paint jobs you know we didn't take shortcuts when we built a
[490.14 → 500.74] 10 000 system main gear falcon northwest yeah we had i forget how many raptor x you know 10 000 rpm
[500.74 → 506.44] drives it had but this buddy who bought it i actually met the customer like we had such a
[506.44 → 511.22] white glove experience that i actually drove to his house to like to fix it for him when he had some
[511.22 → 515.96] kind of no to upgrade it for him when he wanted new hardware later like these customers were very
[515.96 → 521.12] babied by me personally wasn't it like a boutique that just grew out of nothing you guys were you
[521.12 → 525.76] weren't originally doing this right oh man i could talk about that for a while i wanted to we were
[525.76 → 530.96] selling a lot of boxes, but we were doing it at no margin we were actually it's its funny how the
[530.96 → 537.52] industry has come full circle because we were actually doing the same thing that um oh, oh balls what
[537.52 → 543.38] is there uh we actually we uh well it's kind of like what next is doing with build where they sell the
[543.38 → 549.36] components and then there's like a fixed build fee and uh oh crap i forget who else is doing it i think
[549.36 → 554.30] does main gear have a brand that they do that with as well uh i know there's i know there's one that we
[554.30 → 560.04] actually like work with quite frequently bell do you remember who it is what do they do uh the one
[560.04 → 565.08] that has the fixed fee, and then you just buy all the hardware at like market prices uh build redux
[565.08 → 570.66] redux yes, yes redux thank you uh so it's come full circle and like now the boutique builders are
[570.66 → 574.34] actually getting into that business because it is a perfect way to move boxes you get your
[574.34 → 580.88] volumes up with your suppliers you get more MDF, and you also just have work for your workers to do
[580.88 → 586.08] in between the few and far between that are ordering five six thousand ten thousand dollar systems right
[586.08 → 595.32] so anyway this was so i wanted to move from these just white box generic boxes of random custom
[595.32 → 600.88] components into standardizing our builds so that we never ended up with a rampage extreme in anything
[600.88 → 607.82] again and forced by that board literally had a 50 RMA rate for us really literally 50 percent
[607.82 → 616.02] it was awful that sounds bad when Asus launched rogue because it was with that board yeah i was like
[616.02 → 622.36] this brand is doomed because this is the worst product that we have ever seen cross our threshold
[622.36 → 628.12] i don't remember this i i i mean i blacked out yeah you must have blocked it so i was pushing us
[628.12 → 634.50] internally to become more of a boutique system builder and part of that because nobody else cared
[634.50 → 641.04] about this project was that i hand built all of those systems so i remember this system for this
[641.04 → 646.58] baller guy who uh he is the first time i worked with him, he was a day trader and when i went to upgrade
[646.58 → 650.76] his system he was a professional online poker player that was all he did, and he needed the fastest
[650.76 → 655.42] system apparently for that this is the same guy uh yeah yeah this is the same holy shit yeah
[655.42 → 664.10] so when i hand built his system with Oct SLI memory modules that will be that memory will be baked
[664.10 → 669.86] into my brain forever because i couldn't figure it out it would work with two in these slots and then
[669.86 → 672.66] it would stop working with two in those slots, and it would work with two in these slots then it
[672.66 → 679.50] would randomly work with four in all the slots i haven't changed a thing i saw the reach i did
[679.50 → 683.02] i saw the reach of the button you can see he was working himself up right and then all of a sudden
[683.02 → 691.86] went for the button but hey i mean XMP had some XMP had some challenges but i would say today other
[691.86 → 697.32] than the awkward detail that intel technically voids your warranty for using it oh is that true it's
[697.32 → 702.80] really great and works pretty well yeah technically it's overclocking and intel doesn't allow that
[702.80 → 710.42] that's why some OEMS are will stick with deck rather than enabling XMP particularly the tier ones
[710.42 → 715.60] okay that is the reason I've been given i could be mistaken and I'm sure that I'm going to get an
[715.60 → 721.86] angry email from you or maybe a correction video no, no no i can, I add one point of clarification
[721.86 → 728.28] yes overclocking is delightful on arc, and it's not voiding your warranty i knew he was going to bring
[728.28 → 733.00] us there all right let me finish this topic and then yeah i do want to talk to you guys about that
[733.00 → 740.72] so Guildford said cast latency and this yes is how many clock cycles it takes for ram to access data in
[740.72 → 748.20] one of its columns so if you are running at a higher frequency and the frequency and this is for reasons i
[748.20 → 753.38] don't fully understand, but we do ram frequency in mega transfers per second for some reason even though
[753.38 → 761.74] it's a cycle we don't call it a hertz anyone help uh why yeah uh because uh it's an it's an i so if
[761.74 → 766.38] you think about if it's an it's a differential signal sure and uh it's kind of like you can count it as
[766.38 → 771.76] two transfers, so sometimes people double it so calling it an op makes it clear that you don't double
[771.76 → 780.86] thank you yes all right so the cast latency is how many of these cycles these transfers per second
[780.86 → 789.88] uh it takes for ram to access data in one of its columns all right so a 4800 cl38 technically actually
[789.88 → 800.48] has longer latency than a 5200 cl8 ram module now that i knew what i didn't do the math on was whether
[800.48 → 810.76] the 5200 cl40 was enough to counter out 4800 cl38 so you can have a faster module that runs
[810.76 → 817.62] at higher mega transfers per second and it can have a higher cast latency while having lower overall
[817.62 → 824.36] latency in nanoseconds which is what actually matters so Guildford did the math thank you very much
[824.36 → 830.78] the 5200 mega transfer per second cl40 kit actually not only has higher bandwidth by eight percent
[830.78 → 837.42] but three percent lower actual latency too so i was wrong
[837.42 → 847.30] effective latency damn effective latency yes however when comparing between two kits each only
[847.30 → 851.90] a single jade spec away from one another the performance difference remains relatively small
[851.90 → 858.50] so my advice still remains depending on the pricing you want to go with whatever makes the most sense
[858.50 → 864.06] for your budget unless you are getting into very high performance tiers which i don't believe we were
[864.06 → 869.88] looking at the time when you really are trying to eke out every last percent there is a helpful
[869.88 → 875.96] chart from crucial source 2 that actually shows how timings have remained very similar across
[875.96 → 881.40] many specs of ram from DDR to ddr5 and this is kind of cool so why don't we pop this up crucial
[881.40 → 889.88] actually occasionally publishes some very, very cool blog posts uh do you guys mind uh popping us over
[889.88 → 896.02] onto the bottom right real quick i actually used some blog posts from crucial when i was doing up
[896.02 → 903.94] our video on ddr5 we collaborated with skill on it and then we also um turned to there was man there
[903.94 → 908.52] was uh there was's uh this company i forget what they're called but they make PCB design software
[908.52 → 915.36] and they had an amazing blog post on the challenges around designing ddr5 traces and i was like this is so
[915.36 → 923.04] cool how do you publish this for free i love it anyway uh you can see here that our latency even
[923.04 → 929.34] though we've gone from cast latencies of three with SDR and DDR you know two and a half man you could get
[929.34 → 935.36] you could get cast two DDR back in the day couldn't you yeah that uh that Oct uh untested stuff that was
[935.36 → 941.66] literally TT untested but then you they just warranted you to overvolt the snot out of it what a weird
[941.66 → 946.70] company they were anyway um they were yes they did kind of blow up if I'm remembering correctly
[946.70 → 953.38] didn't they oh spectacularly i actually know a fair bit about that um 15 15 nanoseconds of latency and
[953.38 → 961.58] ddr5 at cast 40 compared to two and a half is 16.67 nanoseconds of latency so it's actually a pretty
[961.58 → 969.08] cool table to see how yes that number has gone up a lot but in terms of the real world actual time
[969.08 → 973.94] latency of access it hasn't it's the second time today we've talked about crucial we talked about
[973.94 → 978.36] it at lunch i know i referenced the uh i don't know if they still have a configuration tool like a
[978.36 → 984.08] configuration tool and compatibility tool for you, you would put in your laptop or your motherboard
[984.08 → 989.86] and it would tell you hereare the six modules that will actually be compatible, but you know
[989.86 → 995.38] back in the day a SD and in the first gen SDD that was a more important oh wait i remember that yeah
[995.38 → 1003.80] fun story well that's been a while i was the one who got tasked with taking all the random ass
[1003.80 → 1012.32] crucial modules that they have in that configurator and populating them on the NCI site so that when
[1012.32 → 1019.38] people went through the crucial memory configurator NCI would have a where to buy link so that we could
[1019.38 → 1027.08] place freaking these random orders for these weird skews the distribution was going to take 12 weeks to
[1027.08 → 1033.94] get in stock while the customer yells at us so that they can get the validated DDR memory module for
[1033.94 → 1042.16] their ancient dell OptiPlex so yes great tool i personally have a bit of a grudge against it
[1042.16 → 1047.60] it was an awesome tool though i actually used it a lot but i have like tech work yeah for servers in
[1047.60 → 1051.38] particular yeah like it was actually genuinely really helpful i just haven't thought about it
[1051.38 → 1059.76] and stuff yeah yeah yeah why are you guys here well i just really want to say hi i mean it just seems
[1059.76 → 1068.02] like it's been so long oh, oh and in the jersey arc i just this is just why i wore today yeah that jersey
[1068.02 → 1074.30] i beat around the bush a little bit in the pre-show it's kind of cringe you think yeah i actually
[1074.30 → 1078.98] disagree you disagree i think it's cool i think it goes a little hard i think in
[1078.98 → 1084.98] terms of if you had a Linus jersey you would wear it, and you'd be so stoked no i would yes you would
[1084.98 → 1089.12] i would, you would wear it to badminton 100 well the question is would you ever wear that in anywhere
[1089.12 → 1094.60] other than a work function and the answer to that no, no no i would not so for me, i wore it i would
[1094.60 → 1099.42] actually are really great if you could wear it to a rave as an example oh you know if i was going to a
[1099.42 → 1103.92] rave then yeah it has the right colour yeah you could wear it right yeah if you learn something
[1103.92 → 1109.86] about tap are you a raver i don't rave that's actually why he's in no i don't well whoever's
[1109.86 → 1115.68] listening i don't rave any but like if you're doing outside sports or whatever like i don't know I'd
[1115.68 → 1123.98] throw it on i would wear it if the intel arc branding was on the back i find the bicep on the back it says
[1123.98 → 1129.60] let's play on the back, but you could yeah okay, okay all right, but you know what edition
[1129.60 → 1135.26] yeah, but the good news is that everything else we talked about today made a much, much better
[1135.26 → 1141.24] impression than that shirt i wonder if that's because you're not a soccer fan oh I'm not
[1141.24 → 1148.82] because soccer style jersey that is yes that is okay hold on a second let's have let's have a look
[1148.82 → 1154.32] at the chat i think we should run a let's run a poll okay, okay is the polling system working right
[1154.32 → 1158.38] now Luke uh yep okay do you want to do it because i don't know how to use it okay Luke's going to hit
[1158.38 → 1166.18] the float plane chat with a poll Ryan shroud's intel arc jersey it's not only his, but he does model
[1166.18 → 1172.26] it very well you sweat in it nobody else wants if it's yours now the good news is everything well
[1172.26 → 1176.42] well the while the people respond to the poll the good news is that everything else you guys
[1176.42 → 1181.10] talked about today has been pretty positive so what did you bring up as far as i know this has
[1181.10 → 1186.92] not been shown outside of intel yet um has not you are correct what do you want to say about it what is
[1186.92 → 1192.62] it i would like to say first off uh thanks and i have to say thank you very much for having us here
[1192.62 → 1198.06] oh yeah yeah and i have to tell you i not only do i just love being out and around other people
[1198.06 → 1202.18] because it's been so long, but you've honestly been just a pleasure i got to see the whole place
[1202.18 → 1207.48] and it's quite impressive and I'm just you know wow, so there's that first nobody ever says nice
[1207.48 → 1212.18] things to me on the land show because I'm always just yeah i don't know how to react you know just
[1212.18 → 1216.82] just relax okay now about this I'm also excited because as you know we showed you some performance
[1216.82 → 1223.00] yes right and this is the first card that I've seen from intel that i go you know what it's all
[1223.00 → 1229.76] going to be okay it's all going to be it's all gonna work out and i just i love the fact that we
[1229.76 → 1233.32] considering we can play games with it right, and it plays really well we were playing cyberpunk
[1233.32 → 1239.06] earlier yeah i was going to say we weren't playing like minor VGA like which is not a crypto thing
[1239.06 → 1243.78] by the way do you know minor VGA does anyone know he kind of likes his knowledge i don't minecraft last
[1243.78 → 1249.84] night, and he's like well back in my day back in my day minor VGA i don't know what minor VGA is how
[1249.84 → 1256.04] did I not know okay I'm I'm going to try and get this up I'm going to try and get this up on playdosgames.com
[1256.04 → 1261.40] here uh but anyway the point is we're not talking lightweight games we ran cyberpunk we ran
[1261.40 → 1270.16] f1 2021 uh we ran shadow the Tomb Raider which was good hey these are all games that are did you use
[1270.16 → 1276.32] the thing which thing oh i should have used the thing i didn't use the thing we have we actually
[1276.32 → 1281.92] just built an auto tool for those games oh and you literally all the games that he just listed are in
[1281.92 → 1287.08] there well we were only sort of allowed to we were allowed to kind of look at performance we
[1287.08 → 1290.84] weren't allowed to get analytical oh that was like frame time yeah because we're not we're not at the
[1290.84 → 1294.60] point where we're really sampling this yet i really just wanted to come up and share yeah i know this
[1294.60 → 1298.72] is like a sneak peek but very, very soon i don't I don't know if this is going to bother anybody else
[1298.72 → 1303.44] in the production but if stop slamming your hand oh stop okay sorry sorry
[1303.44 → 1308.42] but very, very soon nobody else wanted to say it i have a lot of production i am very excited i like
[1308.42 → 1314.24] the passion I'm very excited I'm very excited, but this is actually it got it over clocks pretty good
[1314.24 → 1318.90] it's got fantastic you know media but at the end of the day what you really care about is does it
[1318.90 → 1323.42] game it does it game well and i feel like we i feel like we hit it we nailed it now it's a little
[1323.42 → 1328.56] bit more complicated story than obviously you know that i would like to tell yes but yeah I'm sure you
[1328.56 → 1334.70] guys would have loved to fly up here put your hands in your lap twiddle your thumbs and go
[1334.70 → 1342.26] enjoy dude just do your thing yeah i mean we so we started today i think it was this
[1342.26 → 1347.50] morning uh we published a video talking a little bit about performance and a little bit about like
[1347.50 → 1354.26] our plan to roll this out it's something that you know people are eager to see they've wanted to see
[1354.26 → 1360.30] it for a while uh yeah i think three years and counting and yeah, and we get it we understand
[1360.30 → 1365.86] it and now tom and i are like pushing for we're doing it man we're doing it and I'm pretty excited
[1365.86 → 1369.80] so the key thing is before you know it these are going to be available in the channel
[1369.80 → 1373.42] and okay we didn't talk about that we did not talk about it but I'm just going to say before you
[1373.42 → 1378.22] know it kid i mean i guess there's retail i mean there's retail there's a retail box wait is it in
[1378.22 → 1381.60] here yeah oh i assumed you would have taken it out well the people want you to open it
[1381.60 → 1387.68] yeah sure i mean should we give it to the guy with the jersey that by the way 80 80 80 of our
[1387.68 → 1394.10] float plane viewers say cool or wearable wow yeah I'll take it or something better than trash
[1394.10 → 1403.28] cringe and unwearable was 21 so four out of four out of 21 that is a solid win yeah that is a solid
[1403.28 → 1409.40] four out of five sweaty nerds are going to be into it sure hey awesome four that sounds good oh yeah
[1409.40 → 1414.28] here we go hold on a second we're just reframing for you here this is the uh i will say
[1414.28 → 1419.20] it looks really sharp there it is you haven't even seen it with RGB yet yeah so that has RGB that's a
[1419.20 → 1425.10] limited edition it will be available for purchase we've got a cool program controls all the ribs that's
[1425.10 → 1430.54] actually an over-designed card for the cut for the uh chip that's in it, you said you were looking at
[1430.54 → 1434.44] our little monitor, and it was at 61 degrees c while we were gaming you're like that's obviously broken
[1434.44 → 1440.36] 69 actually 69 sorry guesses what nice, and he said nice it was correct it was correct the targeted
[1440.36 → 1445.60] temperature yeah wow so you guys are hitting like 70 degrees under load it was literally reporting 99
[1445.60 → 1454.62] GPU usage which um as far as i can tell seemed to be working yes yeah uh well that's and that's with a
[1454.62 → 1460.08] that's with a dual that's with a dual that's a dual axial yeah they wouldn't talk pricing with us yet
[1460.08 → 1466.76] but when you guys watch the video which by the way is going to be amazing because we got shroud to
[1466.76 → 1472.68] shill for ltdstore.com, and we got tap to shill for float i don't know how it happened it's the most
[1472.68 → 1476.68] when we were talking about this would be our last video because we're going to get fired it was part
[1476.68 → 1481.86] of the reasons why i want to see the video because i know for sure it's my most awkward recording that
[1481.86 → 1487.66] I've ever done no it's no you sure yeah yeah yeah i gave them both some like hosting coaching
[1487.66 → 1491.82] when they were it was good trying really hard i learned a lot it was a great it was a great effort
[1491.82 → 1495.38] I've been out of practice for three and a half years i don't know how to do i haven't seen people
[1495.38 → 1505.54] well you had nothing to talk about exactly oh hey oh damn uh damn we have some questions from
[1505.54 → 1509.22] people do you want to talk a little bit more freestyle or do you want to start no lets do
[1509.22 → 1514.40] questions because you know one of the first questions is hey um are you guys engaging with
[1514.40 → 1518.90] the open source community how is your Linux support going to be for this card well i can tell
[1518.90 → 1522.86] you that our Linux support is going to be great we already have an open driver for Linux right so
[1522.86 → 1525.98] it's its we're not in the same position as some of the other companies that have a little bit of
[1525.98 → 1533.04] schizophrenic relationship uh we are open source oriented right now can I remind you guys um his
[1533.04 → 1538.20] employment history he formerly worked for a green company it doesn't matter it's not about that he
[1538.20 → 1544.00] doesn't have, but he doesn't have any insider knowledge he was actually the receptionist so i don't want it
[1544.00 → 1548.60] to seem like he's throwing shade I'm not throwing shade on anybody i just want to we are very open
[1548.60 → 1554.14] i want to get that out there thank you yes we're very open and uh so our Linux community i think most
[1554.14 → 1558.32] of them realize that we do open standards like if you think open standards you should start thinking
[1558.32 → 1562.66] where did these come from well a lot of them came from intel yeah yeah i mean intel wasn't going to go
[1562.66 → 1568.46] and embrace a closed standard like g-sync for example oh great technology
[1568.46 → 1573.38] personally a fan but intel they're going to wait for adaptive sync obviously right yes
[1573.38 → 1578.00] well you know my history about that so I'm very excited to say that we do support adaptive sync
[1578.00 → 1582.70] and we also have a couple other really cool sync modes like uh smooth sync and another thing that
[1582.70 → 1586.86] we're calling what's the last one called smooth sync fast sync so all okay what's the difference
[1586.86 → 1592.46] no i don't think that's right it's not fast it's smooth sync it's fast sync kind of or whatever it is
[1592.46 → 1597.18] the last one is it like a reflex competitor like no, no it's actually really cool it's like when
[1597.18 → 1600.04] you have when you have tearing like when you're running really fast you're going to tear
[1600.04 → 1606.08] this mode actually blends the two frames so think of it is works with all monitors but what we're
[1606.08 → 1610.96] doing is we're saying we can't get rid of tearing, but we can actually make that transition less jarring
[1610.96 → 1617.86] now do i get it works all the time so i get the latency advantage of not having any kind of sync yes
[1617.86 → 1623.34] but i I'm assuming that would rely on the machine learning hardware no, no no, no it's just a traditional
[1623.34 → 1628.66] blend so think of if it's in our display logic so as we're scanning out lines we kind of know when a
[1628.66 → 1633.52] new frame shows up smooth smooth sync thank you Ryan smooth sync okay so
[1633.52 → 1636.92] that's features available it works with all games because it's in our display hardware
[1636.92 → 1641.16] and it's its vendor neutral and it you know it's going to work on all arc it's pretty cool
[1641.16 → 1645.82] that is actually super cool we have a video for you maybe we could give it you could, you know cut
[1645.82 → 1650.28] it in if you want it's pretty cool now i would like to hear from you guys if you have any other
[1650.28 → 1654.90] questions this is going to be the one and only opportunity to chat with these guys live about this
[1654.90 → 1659.60] here may not be the only although i know that you guys are my last employment day here we don't know
[1659.60 → 1664.06] how that's going to go actually i take it back yeah it could be the last this is it could very well be
[1664.06 → 1669.96] um okay i mean uh crane i don't think they're going to be able to answer that yeah i mean
[1669.96 → 1674.04] like hey what day is it going to be available how much is it going to cost we're not going to answer
[1674.04 → 1677.42] price we're not going to answer specifics on performance, and we're not going to talk of
[1677.42 → 1683.64] specifics on a date AK rain wants to know if there will be a 900 trim or a 700 is the highest
[1683.64 → 1688.46] can you address that i can say yeah you can't right now we have a three family a five family
[1688.46 → 1693.42] and a seven family and that's where our plan ends right now whether someday we change that
[1693.42 → 1698.22] maybe you know we always think into things and i know intel added a nine uh to the CPU
[1698.22 → 1703.40] yeah but right now no plan we have enough names we got products to fill it and that's plenty well the
[1703.40 → 1708.56] way i think of it intel restored the nine because we all knew there was supposed to be a core i9 many
[1708.56 → 1714.88] years before they finally gave us the only like marginally upgraded core i9 wasn't core i9 supposed
[1714.88 → 1723.86] to be the branding for the original heat 1366 i can't was it not it was it seven it was
[1723.86 → 1729.80] seven it was seven so it was really confusing because you had core i's on the consumer platform
[1729.80 → 1737.26] and then you had core i's on the heat platform and it stayed like that for very confusing years very
[1737.26 → 1741.80] confusing so you know will we have a nine maybe you know we'll, we'll see as the products go but i
[1741.80 → 1748.32] think you can make something nine worthy no i think it comes down to like we've got i think the naming
[1748.32 → 1753.42] structure you come up with is actually super useful because it is doesn't elicit direct comparisons to
[1753.42 → 1760.12] the competition yeah right a a series means alchemist next generation will be b it'll be battle
[1760.12 → 1764.78] mage and then you've got the three five seven and then you can use any of the numbers after that for
[1764.78 → 1769.82] your performance can I please respectfully request something of course do you guys have
[1769.82 → 1776.60] influence within the arc business unit oh yes no not so much no we definitely do yes but does he
[1776.60 → 1782.20] though he definitely does he and i are buddies we're like connected okay, okay until one of you is
[1782.20 → 1789.58] fired well if i get fired then he is going to be the man can you guys stick to your guns
[1789.58 → 1796.90] keep the naming scheme sensible yes make it so that it's perfect right now as media and as a
[1796.90 → 1803.26] consumer because you guys actually did do a great job of that intel like intel does not always do a
[1803.26 → 1811.44] great job NVIDIA and AMD many times have seemingly intentionally obfuscated the meaning of their
[1811.44 → 1819.46] model numbers we've seen rebrands we've seen reuse of the same numbers which from a consumer standpoint
[1819.46 → 1825.28] is a nightmare because if you're going and you're troubleshooting something and you search for I'm
[1825.28 → 1834.24] trying to think of you search for AMD 6800 i was thinking they have CPUs they have GPUs uh NVIDIA has
[1834.24 → 1841.58] actually reused uh what man what was it that they uh there's definitely stuff they've reused there's
[1841.58 → 1847.30] there are numbers that have been used by both AMD and NVIDIA so if you search for 80 this oh yes 480
[1847.30 → 1855.94] yeah 480 280 480 these are both great examples so what i would respectfully request is that you
[1855.94 → 1864.58] guys stick to your guns 357 is your tears the letter is your family i don't care if this particular
[1864.58 → 1874.04] letter if j isn't that cool okay if is is jelly i like j if arc just 770 looks looks like
[1874.04 → 1881.66] some kind of swear word in some kind of Cyrillic script in Sanskrit or something like please for
[1881.66 → 1887.36] for consumers it's stick to your guns, but it's not just for consumers right it's like also for
[1887.36 → 1894.42] my sanity yeah as well yes right i would like to mess with his sanity, but we won't okay we will not i
[1894.42 → 1898.60] have an i have a question that I'm gonna I'm going to merge kind of a question for myself and a question
[1898.60 → 1904.90] from the audience they're asking about um you mentioned earlier this is exclusive this it's
[1904.90 → 1910.66] limited edition okay so uh a certain other company that may not be named uh sells certain
[1910.66 → 1916.12] limited edition stuff maybe like just through Best Buy or whatever else is this directly is this limited
[1916.12 → 1921.36] edition directly from you guys or how is i would expect that to show up in multiple channels in the
[1921.36 → 1926.26] U.S. and worldwide intel's distribution is i could even answer that question the way intel's distribution
[1926.26 → 1930.46] works is it'll go through dirty and then there's multiple people and then whether there's
[1930.46 → 1934.10] an exclusive arrangement or not dirty's going to send a bunch of them out the back door to mom and pop
[1934.10 → 1941.24] shops anyway it's all gonna work out yeah even if intel wanted this to be best buy exclusive i pretty
[1941.24 → 1946.44] much promise you wouldn't be yes that's not that's not our intent i think people really like the
[1946.44 → 1949.94] look of that because I'm getting a lot of questions that are basically like can I get this yes
[1949.94 → 1954.60] can you grab it can you pick it up again for a second shroud is that still framed for his hands' no it's
[1954.60 → 1958.68] okay it doesn't it doesn't matter I'll just I'll hold it and explain it so the way they did the RGB on
[1958.68 → 1963.86] this is actually super classy uh the top bar oh are you gonna are you going to fire it over to me
[1963.86 → 1969.60] oh cool how nice is that whoops wrong one whoops wrong one uh whoops you'll get it yeah now we're
[1969.60 → 1973.82] talking now time to charm uh the way they did it is actually super classy and I'm not just shilling I'm
[1973.82 → 1979.30] not being paid to tell you this not today anyway i expect payment tomorrow um there's a there's a nicely
[1979.30 → 1987.78] diffused RGB light bar along the top the intel arc logo right here is also lit, and then it's really
[1987.78 → 1992.26] subtle the way they've done it with the fans from the front you actually wouldn't know so if you've
[1992.26 → 1998.24] got a case that has a vertical GPU mount this thing is going to look absolutely sick it will because the
[1998.24 → 2005.76] RGB is diffused, and it's recessed so it's around the outside of the fan, and they could have gone tacky
[2005.76 → 2011.96] they could have absolutely done like um a translucent fan blade or something along those
[2011.96 → 2018.30] lines they decided not to they kept it classy and i think it looks absolutely awesome thank you for
[2018.30 → 2025.84] that but i have a question from Matt k35 there have been reports of huge GPU power usage from
[2025.84 → 2032.60] NVIDIA and the 4000 models and AMD confirmed well didn't confirm but speculated that i think they said by
[2032.60 → 2038.36] 2025 we could see power consumption as high as like 600 watts or something like that they didn't say
[2038.36 → 2043.72] anything about the next gen, but they said they do foresee much higher GPU power consumption in the
[2043.72 → 2051.36] future um so Matt k35 asks will intel be reaching for such high power consumption in this range or future
[2051.36 → 2058.02] models or how do you guys view the importance of efficiency in the PCIE slot form factor uh well
[2058.02 → 2061.40] obviously efficiency is huge for us, we're not going to be anywhere near those power ranges in the
[2061.40 → 2065.50] alchemist family um i don't know if we've given out a number for this guy i don't think we have
[2065.50 → 2069.50] not but I'd love to tell you it's not going to you know it's not going to burn out any electrical cities
[2069.50 → 2073.98] and you know no, no you don't have to like to get a mortgage to run the power it's very tame and i don't
[2073.98 → 2079.58] think we're going to be participating in that you know above 500 watt GPU anytime soon now that's in the
[2079.58 → 2084.06] consumer space obviously in workstations and in data centres power limits power budgets are much
[2084.06 → 2090.20] different, and so i would just not include those in the conversation yeah fun fact we actually had a bit
[2090.20 → 2096.36] of a miscommunication with one of our data centre uh partners for float plane where we specifically
[2096.36 → 2103.58] asked for uh two critical pieces of infrastructure to be located in different racks sorry there's one
[2103.58 → 2108.48] two okay sure multiple critical pieces of infrastructure to be located in separate racks and
[2108.48 → 2115.04] the reason for that was that occasionally you can have a rack level outage yeah, and it was imperative
[2115.04 → 2121.54] that we not have all of those things go out at the same time for the health of the service now that
[2121.54 → 2127.24] that sort of thing is rare, but it does happen so we got our request, and they said yeah yeah yeah sure
[2127.24 → 2133.86] sure, sure yeah no, no yeah okay, okay okay, okay okay hours later our poor infrastructure guys i know AJ was
[2133.86 → 2139.68] working on it uh did Jonathan touch this as well hours later the timelines are weird but basically
[2139.68 → 2146.52] yeah no i mean hours of work oh like figuring out why something was like weird yeah so they're all in
[2146.52 → 2149.90] the same rack we figure out they're all in the same rack we say why are they all the same rack they go
[2149.90 → 2154.82] oops we'll move them they don't move them we forgot that we have to order new ones because they're like
[2154.82 → 2161.56] water pooled into the rack because it's not immediately obvious yeah like when you're not on site yeah
[2161.56 → 2165.86] physically there yeah if you're there you can look at it and go oh god well that's the land cable
[2165.86 → 2170.32] that's plugged into that or whatever right yeah but when you're not on site it's its not immediately
[2170.32 → 2175.12] obvious from their identifiers that they are actually physically within the same rack so then
[2175.12 → 2181.30] they follow up they say they'll move it okay we find out that they're in the same rack again
[2181.30 → 2186.92] and then they follow up again and what did they say oh we just have to like reorder them
[2186.92 → 2190.68] because they can't, they can't move them because they're water cooled into the rack so they're like
[2190.68 → 2193.82] they're going to do a refund, and they're going to take care of us and stuff, and it's going to be fine
[2193.82 → 2197.88] um we're not going with anyone else we've been working with them for a long time whatever but
[2197.88 → 2203.88] like it's just, but it shows you that in data centres it wasn't even special we didn't order a water
[2203.88 → 2209.42] cooled tier yeah ah they just that's just what they're doing you get water cooled yeah they're
[2209.42 → 2214.24] just they're just that's what they're doing in that particular DC they're water cooling the entire rack
[2214.24 → 2220.42] and they can't just at least for that rack they can't just slide uh a rack unit out of it and go put
[2220.42 → 2225.78] it somewhere else it's its actually like plumbed into the rack so yeah in the data centre i mean
[2225.78 → 2232.06] yeah i wouldn't be surprised to see hundreds of what i mean man some of the CPUs intel is doing for
[2232.06 → 2238.92] the data centre are wild yeah well the whole uh you know changing of the data centre power centres and
[2238.92 → 2243.14] the and the cooling whole building cooling have you been there to see these things they're incredible
[2243.14 → 2247.42] they're really cool giant fans at the end and they kind of blow passively through the whole thing
[2247.42 → 2253.16] i wish we could get an actual like tour of a really high-end data yeah but every single data
[2253.16 → 2259.02] centre is just like yeah, but that's one I'm talking like a full you should, it's amazing they're hard to
[2259.02 → 2264.30] get into is that we have one engineering data centre and like it's a SC yeah one of the old
[2264.30 → 2267.92] SC buildings that we used to be a fab that we've converted into a data centre we might be able to get
[2267.92 → 2277.78] okay another option is um Luke i don't want to fly to France i do but i miss travelling i used to meet
[2277.78 → 2283.04] you guys all the time yeah yeah i might as well i might as well just talk about this so shadow tech
[2283.04 → 2291.82] um oh reached out, and they might be able to get us into a major data centre the one that we use
[2291.82 → 2300.04] oh, oh in France as part of what is this what is this something so uh shadow uses um
[2300.04 → 2307.66] i forget what it's called g-force now g-force what's the local streaming one help me oh the
[2307.66 → 2312.12] local streaming one, so there's g-force now which is the cloud yeah not the cloud one and i don't
[2312.12 → 2315.86] know what they call the local stream one it's kind of always been a little bit of a less awesome thing
[2315.86 → 2320.12] it's kind of a hybrid between them because what they're essentially doing is they're using the
[2320.12 → 2325.50] local streaming one, but they're doing it over the internet interesting so it's not it's not cloud
[2325.50 → 2331.08] oh i see what you're saying yeah so it's like peer-to-peer exactly so you connect over
[2331.08 → 2337.46] some kind of VPN that they've figured out like a nice low latency VPN, and then you can game on your
[2337.46 → 2344.20] dedicated system yeah with your dedicated GPU that was their model they ran into some bankruptcy
[2344.20 → 2349.96] trouble recently some investor something uh the crypto mining shortages apparently
[2349.96 → 2354.74] affected them a lot uh i don't know I'm sure that if we end up collaborating we'll get all the
[2354.74 → 2361.68] details, and we'll, we'll get that for you guys uh but yeah i mean i am not going to fly to France but
[2361.68 → 2367.12] maybe we do uh maybe Luke you know does a euro tour that'd be sweet we might end up not
[2367.12 → 2371.62] sending you we might send someone else I'm not promising anything but uh that would be that would
[2371.62 → 2374.98] be super cool that hurts it seems like a bait switch that didn't have that hurt because hey you
[2374.98 → 2379.36] want to go i felt like that was gone you want to go you want to go yes because you don't host LTT
[2379.36 → 2383.84] videos anymore so i don't know I've always loved the travelling so I've always loved shows you
[2383.84 → 2389.40] know that I'm not i won't, I won't then this is it that's my commitment yeah, thank you if we do the
[2389.40 → 2395.26] collab then Luke will go nice hole in the chat let's see i wanna i want to get I'd love to go with
[2395.26 → 2399.14] Luke but i don't know yeah i can I mean that would be fun let's do it you would be fun that'd
[2399.14 → 2404.34] be cool game stream yes game stream that's the one yeah do you know uh NVIDIA had also
[2404.34 → 2409.72] a Copley mode did you ever see that wait what we didn't know that what's Copley wait a second
[2409.72 → 2416.94] maybe i don't know anything about no Copley i thought that was a thing i think it was a
[2416.94 → 2422.92] thing see if you can find Copley oh no everybody's googling now yeah video Copley uh is it a thing
[2422.92 → 2429.32] i see cosplay no, no no this is cosplay yeah it's not a thing okay well i apologize if anybody
[2429.32 → 2433.76] dresses like a graphics card i don't know anything about no Copley what he meant to say was
[2433.76 → 2439.90] cosplay there are people that have cosplayed as NVIDIA graphics cards experience share yes
[2439.90 → 2446.94] oh there you go thank you god i was starting to have a little detail a little flashbacks
[2446.94 → 2452.58] here with NVIDIA share no this isn't it okay broadcast your gameplay with GeForce experience
[2452.58 → 2457.96] share yeah salt z to bring up the share overlay yes that so it's pretty cool actually and uh you
[2457.96 → 2463.68] can actually uh assuming this is what i remember it to be you can actually uh share your pc screen
[2463.68 → 2469.94] to a remote device, and they can do Io back to your game so it's effectively allowing cooperative play
[2469.94 → 2476.16] and remote play on your pc interesting there was another service i saw that did something like that
[2476.16 → 2484.50] where it was like uh, uh they it was uh it's kind of like in um uh, uh you get like you can't get
[2484.50 → 2489.64] past this part of a game you can hire a Sherpa you can hire an expert to come in yes that was an
[2489.64 → 2493.22] actual no it's still an actual thing oh of course it is of course yes
[2493.22 → 2497.90] oh my goodness yeah go check it out it's actually pretty cool it never really took off
[2497.90 → 2502.66] because it's its just kind of hard for people to get their heads around yeah i can see that and
[2502.66 → 2506.86] there's also there's competing ways to do that like you can set it up through steam yeah where you can
[2506.86 → 2512.16] play your steam games remotely using the same encoder now i guess this is a perfect
[2512.16 → 2517.94] opportunity for you guys to talk then about video encoding one of the things that enables these kinds of
[2517.94 → 2525.22] remote play experiences are the high-end hardware encoding engines that are built into modern GPUs
[2525.22 → 2531.34] because if we had to use software encode and decode for that matter on the host and the client device
[2531.34 → 2536.18] you'd be looking at latency that even ignoring the internet would be too high to have a good gaming
[2536.18 → 2541.28] experience and the image quality would be terrible it would be compressed to high hell so one of the
[2541.28 → 2545.36] things that we already know that intel arc is perfect at because we checked it out on a laptop
[2545.36 → 2552.18] recently is encoded and decode now what i want to know because i am a bit of an enthusiast whether
[2552.18 → 2556.70] we're talking yeah twitch chat's talking about parsec which is another really cool software for low
[2556.70 → 2561.62] latency remote gaming okay and it's not steam specific and is not locked into any like GeForce
[2561.62 → 2567.00] driver anything like that you can use it with AMD you can use it with intel um I'm going to check that
[2567.00 → 2572.06] out I've not heard it so as an enthusiast for this kind of technology this kind of remote play
[2572.06 → 2577.76] technology i believe we were actually the first ones to ever do uh did we get surround working
[2577.76 → 2584.74] when steam for when valve first launched their remote uh i remember working on this but i honestly
[2584.74 → 2590.14] yeah we got either like 4k or surround working or something, and it was so Jacky, and it was so
[2590.14 → 2596.10] uh ridiculous that i was actually contacted by the developer from valve who was working on the
[2596.10 → 2600.52] technology internally going wow i can't believe you tried that i have one tiny cubicle i don't even have
[2600.52 → 2604.54] enough monitors that are good enough to like to try this you're pushing the technology to the limits
[2604.54 → 2611.02] man keep going um anyway i love this stuff so one of the things that i wanted to know was can I expect
[2611.02 → 2616.62] an improvement in this kind of technology with the encode and decode engine that you guys have built
[2616.62 → 2622.04] into arc a hundred percent obviously i mean we've already talked that we support native av1 encode for
[2622.04 → 2626.74] the first time yeah so what's the advantage of av1 talk to me like I'm five okay av1 because i still
[2626.74 → 2631.62] make mistakes about ram bandwidth and latency so I'm clearly you got put in your place i did yeah
[2631.62 → 2636.82] it's true uh av1 is a next generation codec standard so it basically reduces the bandwidth
[2636.82 → 2643.44] required for a high quality upload and so if you encode to av1 you can kind of either push
[2643.44 → 2649.14] more bits of quality up to the cloud so you can have a higher quality uh stream, or you can reduce
[2649.14 → 2653.20] the bandwidth and kind of maybe reduce some of the jitter reduce some of the stutter, and it's smaller
[2653.20 → 2658.20] file sizes if you're is you're recording locally so av1 is sort of like the future of what is
[2658.20 → 2662.92] encoding going to look like, and it's supported natively in hardware on all of our GPU now when
[2662.92 → 2668.12] you say supported natively in hardware i think that's something that a lot of people don't
[2668.12 → 2673.56] understand is just because you have hardware support for encoding uh in a particular manner that
[2673.56 → 2680.70] doesn't mean that your quality is as good as if you were to do it through software so and it also
[2680.70 → 2686.12] doesn't necessarily mean that it would be fast enough for a real-time application like game
[2686.12 → 2691.94] streaming yeah is it that good it is great okay it is great, and you're going to get to test it right
[2691.94 → 2696.82] you're going to you're you're going to basically yeah, so there's no point lying yeah i mean i think
[2696.82 → 2702.06] it's great it's actually you guys remember quick sync right quick sync yes has been awesome for forever
[2702.06 → 2706.98] and this is using a lot of the similar media technology, but quick sync hasn't seen the kind of
[2706.98 → 2711.86] support that we've seen for other encoders how why do you guys why do you guys suck at
[2711.86 → 2718.52] propagating quick sync like i remember we'd get these benchmarks in these like weird Chinese like
[2718.52 → 2727.06] DVD authoring suites, and we'd be like why it's amazing, and then it takes apple to go and popularize
[2727.06 → 2733.18] the concept of hardware encoding accelerating you know mainstream applications like final cut and all
[2733.18 → 2737.84] of a sudden everyone goes wow this is a great idea why did intel suck so much at communicating the
[2737.84 → 2744.34] importance of quick sync you know it's hard to put a name on it, i blame Ryan i blame Ryan why that
[2744.34 → 2748.86] doesn't mean i can't blame Ryan i mean come on it's certain uh you know i think what it comes down to is
[2748.86 → 2755.72] like it's all about software enabling developer relations all that and intel has i also like an
[2755.72 → 2762.52] unparalleled infrastructure for that the problem i think is that um there are some complexities of
[2762.52 → 2769.60] things in quick sync wasn't always turned on by default when you did a when you made a desktop
[2769.60 → 2775.46] system right your integrated graphics gets turned off and developers don't they're like well if
[2775.46 → 2780.92] why am I working on this project if that's not the case right and i remember we had very specific
[2780.92 → 2787.30] discussions as we were launching uh, uh 10th or 11th gen about the were you know quick sync is super
[2787.30 → 2793.12] important we need to tell motherboard vendors you need to leave the default cannot be off anymore the
[2793.12 → 2796.98] default needs to be that integrated graphics stays on because that's what enables the media engines to
[2796.98 → 2801.50] be accessible and there's no good reason to have it off anymore like any power years and years ago you
[2801.50 → 2806.52] might make the case that it was you know compatibility multiple drivers yeah yeah but like when windows
[2806.52 → 2810.38] handles multiple vendor drivers all the time so if you had an NVIDIA or radon card you could still
[2810.38 → 2816.94] have it all worked, and it's all well integrated or an arc card now but someday someday someday soon
[2816.94 → 2821.24] and that but now when you do that when you have an arc card right you get you we can take advantage
[2821.24 → 2826.08] of both engines right so uh i know raja has talked about it a little bit we haven't talked about it
[2826.08 → 2831.42] recently, but we have uh i think it's called stream assist which is an idea that if you have an arc
[2831.42 → 2836.04] card in your system, and you have a CPU with integrated graphics you can actually use the
[2836.04 → 2842.28] integrated graphics quick sync encode engine to handle all the encode operations and keep
[2842.28 → 2846.90] the offload off that's a big problem actually particularly when you're running very demanding
[2846.90 → 2854.16] games like you've probably run into this you stream so yeah uh bank is amazing its outstanding
[2854.16 → 2860.28] it's been the industry leader for basically since it was implemented yeah but when you're playing a
[2860.28 → 2865.26] heavy game, and you're trying to encode you can sometimes run into issues where either the encoder
[2865.26 → 2869.66] will get overloaded, or you will drop significant frames and a lot of games these days we've moved
[2869.66 → 2874.00] away from RTS's for the most part so a lot of games these days are GPU bound not CPU bound
[2874.00 → 2880.18] so you run into that a lot that's actually a pretty cool idea and might be the first genuine example
[2880.18 → 2886.32] of someone trying to marry integrated and discrete graphics we are all over that trying over and over
[2886.32 → 2890.38] and over and over again, so there's a whole collection of technologies that we have called deep link
[2890.38 → 2895.56] and i think we've described deep link a little bit, but it's the concept of how can we use all the
[2895.56 → 2900.88] power of that integrated CPU which has graphics and now connect arc graphics to it what are the
[2900.88 → 2905.58] leverages there and there's lots of them right, and it's going to become very, very common that you'll
[2905.58 → 2911.04] see features on arc that are only activated when it's coupled with an intel CPU it's going to be
[2911.04 → 2918.10] stream assist is one of those and then um uh like hyper hyper encode uses the uh the
[2918.10 → 2922.80] encode engines on the integrated and the encode engines on the discrete arc graphics, and it will
[2922.80 → 2928.18] i think it's 60 you know 60 faster something like that right now tell me something
[2928.18 → 2935.32] is there a technical limitation that would prevent this quick sync assist from working with an NVIDIA or
[2935.32 → 2942.72] an AMD card because in my humble opinion it would be a good guy move, and it would be extremely positive
[2942.72 → 2949.04] press for intel very open standard style to get some mind share and some awareness within the
[2949.04 → 2954.98] streaming community which by the way is really influential i mean a great example of this is the
[2954.98 → 2961.80] recently defunct artesian builds which i had never even heard of i had no idea they existed until they
[2961.80 → 2967.96] screwed over a small streamer with a prize when absolutely supernova uh Steve from gamers nexus has
[2967.96 → 2973.54] actually talked i saw it a lot about artesian builds and and and we all discovered that they
[2973.54 → 2977.98] were actually running an enormous operation what they have like 40 employees 60 employees or something
[2977.98 → 2983.42] like that apparently i don't know the last video is like a 20 million dollar business yeah like
[2983.42 → 2987.82] they were running this enormous operation their only way they marketed as far as i could tell
[2987.82 → 2994.22] was streaming building machines and then sponsoring as many tiny streamers as they could
[2994.22 → 2999.18] with these gaming rigs and they turned it into this enormous freaking business so
[2999.18 → 3006.74] if i can is i can put pressure on you guys in a very public forum uh we've got almost 20 000 people
[3006.74 → 3011.84] watching right now by the way say hi, hi 20 000 people thank you guys very much for tuning in i would
[3011.84 → 3018.78] like to see intel try to take a very open approach to their technology because if i was a streamer and all i
[3018.78 → 3024.12] ever knew was GeForce or all i ever knew was radon which is less common in the streaming
[3024.12 → 3028.10] space because of bank if all of a sudden you guys were to get your foot in the door and go hey
[3028.10 → 3033.36] you probably already have an intel CPU we have this really great feature that you're going to like
[3033.36 → 3037.00] that is going to save you from those encoding overload errors it's going to save you from any
[3037.00 → 3043.66] kind of fps drop when you're uh when you're running a particularly demanding game um all of a
[3043.66 → 3048.24] sudden they're sitting there going okay I'm using this intel branded technology it's helping me with my
[3048.24 → 3052.66] game streaming and i think in terms of mind share that could be extremely helpful i think that's a fair
[3052.66 → 3057.26] point let us go look at that and i actually I'm not going to say it already but i think it may work
[3057.26 → 3061.44] but i think we need to go look at it because what's i thinking happening is most of those GPUs
[3061.44 → 3067.14] are turned off in the bias but uh, but we can take it and go look I'll give you an update okay yeah i mean
[3067.14 → 3071.60] it's just it's one of those things where I'm thinking about this not from an intel needs to market
[3071.60 → 3077.54] better standpoint necessarily that's my pitch to you guys yeah but from a hey i want technology to work
[3077.54 → 3082.46] better yeah standpoint it's its a very fair request it is and and and and yeah and you
[3082.46 → 3086.72] know what honestly there's nothing that offends me more than being treated like I'm not a good
[3086.72 → 3094.56] enough customer um when i bought my AirPods Pro apple basically said well f**k you don't need a
[3094.56 → 3098.08] battery meter of an android i saw you reaching for it, you don't need to you don't need to be able to
[3098.08 → 3104.64] update your firmware because you didn't buy enough apple products you can only update your firmware
[3104.64 → 3110.04] with this thing with an iPhone is that right that is correct you cannot update the firmware
[3110.04 → 3116.94] by plugging in a lightning port and plugging it into a pc through iTunes or whatever they did not
[3116.94 → 3124.26] create a way to do that, and they did that because i am not worthy enough i didn't buy enough apple
[3124.26 → 3129.82] products and i don't like it i think it's arrogant and i think it's extremely anti-consumer to move back
[3129.82 → 3134.78] from apple uh i think you're worthy i want you to know that i think you're worthy yeah
[3134.78 → 3141.36] your whole family loves you yeah and I'm smart enough and gosh darn it people like there's an old
[3141.36 → 3147.88] reference uh three pin power connector three pin connector next to the power connectors uh yes uh
[3147.88 → 3153.00] are you able to talk about that yeah it's fine this three pin connector on the card is the
[3153.00 → 3159.98] cable uh maybe they're not perfect there's a small three pin connection we can't see it's too
[3159.98 → 3167.86] dark yeah um that is the USB connection to uh control the ribs yeah so you it will come
[3167.86 → 3172.06] with actually here it will come with this cable right that connects there now i noticed that's a
[3172.06 → 3176.48] super weird USB header yes it goes to a header on a motherboard it doesn't have all four pins in it
[3176.48 → 3182.10] you don't need four really yeah because the card has already got power yeah yeah yeah I've never seen
[3182.10 → 3187.96] anybody do that though even on a powered device that is a super weird it is we're weird we're weird
[3187.96 → 3195.90] dudes man we're weird dudes we do weird things get used to it, I'm smart enough people like me damn it
[3195.90 → 3203.68] all right Mr small the quote was close the next question and this one comes with uh
[3203.68 → 3208.54] with i think probably a few daggers from the person who asked it but um are there any cutoffs or
[3208.54 → 3213.60] limitations or anything like that are put in place uh somewhat artificially in order to separate
[3213.60 → 3219.94] and not compete from enterprise skews yeah i want to know that because that's something that has
[3219.94 → 3227.32] offended me a lot on the NVIDIA side the way that i have wanted to be able to virtualize my GPU course
[3227.32 → 3232.80] basically since i learned virtualization was a thing and found out that it is the coolest technology
[3232.80 → 3237.56] technology that no consumer realizes that they use it's turned off on g force right it's turned
[3237.56 → 3241.46] off on g you guys can do that on here he's going to make a bunch of videos about it yeah i sure will
[3241.46 → 3247.56] i guarantee i sure will the GP i know the GPU supports the virtualization as part of the product
[3247.56 → 3254.18] that we i think we still talk about it as arctic sound right which is the data centre version of this
[3254.18 → 3260.20] uh it is does virtualization i don't know if it is enabled in the client version yeah we're a
[3260.20 → 3264.72] little bit ignorant on that but i hear you okay now i hear you because it's one of those things
[3264.72 → 3271.10] where the reality of it is i don't even i think this is one of those cases where i can meet you
[3271.10 → 3277.40] halfway you know when uh when titan was first introduced i think that was actually a pretty
[3277.40 → 3282.84] reasonable olive branch and turned into such a successful product line that NVIDIA completely
[3282.84 → 3290.72] forgot what the purpose for it ever was which was the less cut down fp64 performance right they
[3290.72 → 3295.16] completely forgot what the point of the product ever was and just turned it into a halo gaming skew
[3295.16 → 3302.84] but i accepted that olive branch of hey it's not quite a squadron it's not quite a g-force it's
[3302.84 → 3308.12] something else it's a titan if is is you guys were to go back to the product team and say
[3308.12 → 3315.68] hey um you know what if we what is we compromise what if it's not quite a data centre skew because
[3315.68 → 3321.02] we don't necessarily want data centres just buying up all of our retail inventory because that works
[3321.02 → 3325.50] great when the crypto miners do it so I'm sure it'll work awesome when the data centre guys do it
[3325.50 → 3331.48] um you know we do need to retain some kind of uh differentiation because there is additional
[3331.48 → 3335.92] that's the thing you guys got to understand there is additional validation and additional software and
[3335.92 → 3340.20] hardware engineering that goes into creating features that consumers frankly don't care about
[3340.20 → 3346.78] and will never use and somebody has to pay for it and when those somebodies are not tens or hundreds
[3346.78 → 3354.56] of millions of gamers but rather dozens or hundreds of enterprise companies well the cost has to go up
[3354.56 → 3359.02] a lot yeah that's just the way it works that's business otherwise we wouldn't have these features
[3359.02 → 3365.86] existing at all yeah so i get it but I'd love to see a compromise skew well let me I'm just want to
[3365.86 → 3371.94] say i think that's a fair ask but right now we have just so much going on getting into the market
[3371.94 → 3379.10] and i feel like i can be patient yeah just give us a little time we have got a tremendous uh consumer
[3379.10 → 3383.68] gaming card, and we've got actually data data data centre parts that we're launching as well
[3383.68 → 3388.20] and on our next generation i would say there's going to be time to think about how do we how do we
[3388.20 → 3394.12] kind of segment this a little bit better edd666999 says yeah NVIDIA and 10-bit colour was a great
[3394.12 → 3400.48] example of this kind of artificial differentiation for a very for too long and when they finally
[3400.48 → 3404.88] launched it consumers were super happy and guess what squadron still sell yeah even though they don't
[3404.88 → 3408.52] call them squadron anymore because which does they don't call them anymore no what do they call you
[3408.52 → 3415.36] didn't know that it's just a6000 it's just called NVIDIA it is the stupidest thing ever see this is
[3415.36 → 3419.48] what I'm talking about how did I miss the naming problem how did I miss this every because everyone
[3419.48 → 3424.32] still calls it, and they're not, and they're not tesla anymore either because nobody understands
[3424.32 → 3432.02] the branding why would you take a solid well understood brand and just crap on it so that
[3432.02 → 3437.56] nobody understands what your product is it's just it's asinine i can't fathom it so we've had a lot
[3437.56 → 3443.38] of people in chat say that they would buy it if it supported virtualization uh a non-zero amount of
[3443.38 → 3451.42] those people being our own staff uh so i threw up a poll there 's's a few uh so i threw
[3451.42 → 3457.12] up a poll just asking if uh is people would buy it if it had the support and 84 said yes, and you know
[3457.12 → 3461.84] this is the kind of thing that's super important to advocate for internally because those 84 of people
[3461.84 → 3470.50] literally is 144 people that's if it's nothing right it's a drop in the bucket for a company like intel
[3470.50 → 3475.60] honestly it's a drop in the bucket for a company like us if 144 of our subscribers were like we're
[3475.60 → 3481.86] not going to watch your videos any more we'd be very sad yeah and business would continue as usual the
[3481.86 → 3489.40] very next day unaffected except that these are micro influencers these are the people who recommend
[3489.40 → 3494.44] to their friends if you recommend to their friends these are the point of contact for so many
[3494.44 → 3501.14] families or friend networks where they learn about you know who's the good guys in the industry
[3501.14 → 3506.46] who is doing things that matter i don't think you get any argument from us on the value of those
[3506.46 → 3510.70] individuals and their opinions and point of view and internally we have all kinds of
[3510.70 → 3516.26] designations you know like hardware elders is a term that gets used people who are really hardware
[3516.26 → 3522.16] elders is a term which is like i like that i like that like the respected the wise old lion on the
[3522.16 → 3529.88] mountain right that like understands everything except ram yeah except latency um, and it's so we
[3529.88 → 3535.06] we see the value of that group i think what Tom's saying is lets we can go ask the questions and
[3535.06 → 3542.10] see uh but i think you want us to focus on hey get this out as the best gaming product you could
[3542.10 → 3549.10] possibly do first yeah uh and uh you know but i think it's good to know now right oh yeah i mean
[3549.10 → 3552.58] yeah we've got to define things now yeah it's good i mean you have to be thinking about this stuff
[3552.58 → 3558.46] because the last thing you want is to draw a line in the sand today that's like we're never gonna
[3558.46 → 3563.90] do it never you now and then and then end up having to deal with the backlash of drawing the
[3563.90 → 3570.22] line in the first place sure and then have to create a have to dispel a bunch of then myths about
[3570.22 → 3575.34] how your product doesn't do it when you ultimately do reverse course uh, and you know that's a lot of
[3575.34 → 3580.84] work how many media tours have you had to do where you have to explain like you know oh well no we
[3580.84 → 3587.06] don't actually have that banding any more we've got proper 10-bit support on g-force it's its a little
[3587.06 → 3592.48] awkward yeah it's a ton of work um all right is there anything else that you guys wanted to go over
[3592.48 → 3598.52] for us while you're while you're talking to the peeps out there i you know i i i don't think so i think
[3598.52 → 3605.70] um you know my view on this is really uh the next we'll say a couple of months is going to be
[3605.70 → 3610.80] fascinating we're going to we're going to talk directly to uh the gaming community we're
[3610.80 → 3615.44] going to talk directly to to to groups like you guys, and we want to we want to start to tell the
[3615.44 → 3620.34] story of what this is talk about the performance talk about the intricacies be very honest and
[3620.34 → 3625.60] truthful and transparent about where we stand with certain game titles or certain functions and the
[3625.60 → 3630.72] discussions we had today and a follow-up of like your hp notebook review yeah right we're
[3630.72 → 3636.74] like we're it's not a great outcome of that review but I'd say the outcome for us is that people pay
[3636.74 → 3642.78] attention oh my god yes that was a great review for us actually it was a shitty it was I'm sorry it was a
[3642.78 → 3650.28] uh uh uh review for that system but in terms of getting us to pay attention i think that was
[3650.28 → 3655.06] a big step and to be clear the two people in this room with me are not the people that weren't
[3655.06 → 3660.94] paying attention, but big companies sometimes have communication challenges, and honestly we're at
[3660.94 → 3666.06] the scale now where we sometimes run into these things yeah we had an incident last week
[3666.06 → 3671.80] i think it was where something got put into a video that was offensive to a particular group of people
[3671.80 → 3677.78] and all of a sudden like i hadn't I hadn't I didn't review the video i didn't like i don't approve
[3677.78 → 3684.36] every joke we tell right you know or every uh you know like random text insertion in in in our
[3684.36 → 3690.30] content, and you know that's, and sometimes it takes whether it's a member of the public or whether it's
[3690.30 → 3695.54] a member of the press to come in and raise those flags so that the right people are paying attention
[3695.54 → 3702.34] to them so i mean I've always said that we give intel a lot of heat we give them a lot of flack you
[3702.34 → 3707.62] know whether it's the famous walking in the rain video that it's yes i know ruffled some feathers
[3707.62 → 3714.64] it's all good it's all good or whether it's the follow-up where i literally pretended to be being
[3714.64 → 3720.24] held hostage by intel with a literal gun to my head it's all good i know ruffled some feathers for sure
[3720.24 → 3725.62] you know we've definitely given intel a lot of flack but one of the things that intel has over the 10
[3725.62 → 3730.34] years now that we've been working with them as an independent media company the one thing intel has done
[3730.34 → 3737.40] well is they've taken their lumps taken their wins and worked with us regardless they've understood
[3737.40 → 3744.34] that whether they like it or not that's our role tell the truth we have to because otherwise when
[3744.34 → 3748.98] you guys release a great product, and we say it's great no one's going to believe me yeah i totally get
[3748.98 → 3753.92] it and every time that we do that with another company, and they don't handle it well we get to
[3753.92 → 3757.88] point at intel and be like look they do it well why don't you act more like them, I've actually done
[3757.88 → 3762.60] a lot of it's literally happened multiple is that true yeah oh wow yeah it's like yeah they have a
[3762.60 → 3767.04] they have a have they've got some stuff to learn about growing up like they know yeah
[3767.04 → 3771.30] they've got a lot of growing up to do if they can't handle criticism than basically what that means to
[3771.30 → 3774.64] me is they don't really want to make their products better right because there 's's a lot of
[3774.64 → 3779.50] companies where whether it's just the PR reps or whether it's actually a culture that goes all the
[3779.50 → 3786.82] way to the top where they actually do value a negative review i do a critical review there's
[3786.82 → 3793.62] no question oh well i know you do i know you do and we do but sometimes you know it's uh
[3793.62 → 3799.80] it's hard to sell that as beneficial internally and i know that I'm sure i had a particularly
[3799.80 → 3807.44] big blow up with uh your previous company uh over um a critical review that wasn't even on my channel
[3807.44 → 3812.44] oh i know what you're talking about yeah with uh with the whole hardware unboxed situation
[3812.44 → 3817.60] and you know that was an example of whether it was an individual or whether it was a group of
[3817.60 → 3821.44] individuals whether it came from leadership I'm not going to speculate and you're not going to say
[3821.44 → 3826.06] anything I'm definitely not going to say yeah that would be for the best um there was a
[3826.06 → 3830.92] complete misunderstanding of what the value of media is and why they engage with us there was this
[3830.92 → 3837.10] there was this calculus that was being done for the cost the actual bill of materials cost of a
[3837.10 → 3843.38] review sample versus the marketing benefit of the finished review i was like this is not how this
[3843.38 → 3852.28] works at all i have a question about the launch for both of you sure this launch was keeping
[3852.28 → 3859.14] us on topic but he is he brings us right back drive it back in um this launch was quite abnormal um
[3859.14 → 3865.34] china launching with your lower skew stuff like that can you guys talk about the thought process there
[3865.34 → 3869.82] or anything um well Linus you found out today that we have some sensitivities in the design
[3869.82 → 3875.78] especially things around rebar right resizable bar and so not like concrete reinforcement
[3875.78 → 3883.06] yeah and so maybe both yeah so some of our thinking was let's try to restrict the platform set
[3883.06 → 3887.12] that we're going after and so that was where the idea came was well why don't we do system integrators
[3887.12 → 3891.48] first, and effectively we can control the motherboard that these guys get plugged into we make sure
[3891.48 → 3895.54] everything's perfect but i have to tell you we've learned a lot i would, I don't think we would do
[3895.54 → 3900.64] this again that particular cycle i don't think yeah i don't know and what what what we've also
[3900.64 → 3905.38] learned is that you know things are not going to stay small things are going to go oh yeah and
[3905.38 → 3910.54] and so i think all of this learning has said let's just kind of move forward right, and we're gonna we're
[3910.54 → 3915.32] going to say we're going to get samples of the a380 into the hands of press here in the United States
[3915.32 → 3919.92] and Europe that want it, and we're just gonna you know be open and transparent did you just say
[3919.92 → 3926.96] here in the United States I'm sorry here in Canada apologize oh Canada okay all right i give
[3926.96 → 3931.42] we're like 20 minutes from the border i don't know yeah yeah no you're definitely Canada
[3931.42 → 3936.32] yeah so i'm going forward though what's fascinating is we keep talking about launch as
[3936.32 → 3940.84] if that's a moment in time and i really think that's almost old thinking because there 's's
[3940.84 → 3946.74] not really a launch per se any more mostly fair enough where we kind of like build up we get
[3946.74 → 3951.44] everybody together we all sit in a room we talk to you for two hours or two days and then and then
[3951.44 → 3955.92] we're done you go home and that's not going to happen this time right so think of it like we
[3955.92 → 3959.98] are starting to work with you, and we're working with others, and we're telling our story sort of
[3959.98 → 3965.00] episodically sure and i think that's going to be much more appropriate for where we are today like
[3965.00 → 3970.00] how do we consume media today i think as well to throw you guys progress yeah in progress yeah
[3970.00 → 3973.48] to throw you guys a bone to i think this like i don't know what you'd call it sort of tour
[3973.48 → 3977.50] roundtable that you guys are doing yes because it's not just us yeah right i think that is
[3977.50 → 3982.12] actually a very good idea uh because like this is very different from what we saw previously
[3982.12 → 3986.52] the tone and conversation needs to change a little bit yeah and having you guys come out
[3986.52 → 3990.72] directly i think thank you Luke i appreciate that it's not often that people say nice things to us
[3990.72 → 3997.62] they're hanging out with this guy yeah it's very rare it's very rare
[3997.62 → 4006.60] um okay so the last my kind of last word is the reason that i care so much about intel entering
[4006.60 → 4013.80] the discrete GPU space is because it has been very clear to me that while AMD has absolutely
[4013.80 → 4020.86] had a presence at times uh we all had a good laugh about some of the AMD GPUs that we have on our
[4020.86 → 4026.40] shelf and how utterly irrelevant they were um they didn't participate they were actually very
[4026.40 → 4033.34] professional intel representatives i laughed we all laughed i mean because they've
[4033.34 → 4038.94] released skews that were essentially just we have some crazy chips, and we have no idea what to
[4038.94 → 4044.14] do with these done a run of cards, and then they've just completely disappeared from the market and
[4044.14 → 4049.92] gamers sometimes like almost none of them too yeah gamers are left going what just what happened
[4049.92 → 4056.18] what happened so from my point of view the discrete GPU market has essentially been a monopoly for a very
[4056.18 → 4064.70] very long time and i want i am rooting for intel to come in not necessarily because I'm even going to
[4064.70 → 4071.10] run an arc GPU I'm making no commitments about that whatsoever but what i want is a true viable
[4071.10 → 4077.04] other option for gamers i want something to disrupt the monopoly and i want you guys to come in
[4077.04 → 4082.98] and be the good guy i want you to play the underdog in a way that i don't think intel's really accustomed
[4082.98 → 4090.28] to doing it's very true has that been difficult culturally there um i don't know i don't know if i
[4090.28 → 4094.44] would consider it difficult right i think you have to get some of the people on the teams in a little
[4094.44 → 4100.26] bit of a different mindset right but it's actually empowering them because we always feel like
[4100.26 → 4105.86] this tour this kind of serial launch this episodic launch thing is an is something you do
[4105.86 → 4110.58] when you're the underdog yeah you're scrappy right, and you're like if you're is you're launching 13th
[4110.58 → 4115.90] gen whatever right yeah crank the crank you've done it 12 times you've done this a bunch you know you're
[4115.90 → 4119.72] you're already the leader you know you're going to be the leader the next time you know you just you
[4119.72 → 4126.20] just do it right and so it's its actually uh opened up options for us as the graphics group to come
[4126.20 → 4131.06] out and do things different like we're just oh like how many times did in our discussions here
[4131.06 → 4136.74] today you ask us a question and tom and i like yeah just answer it yeah just answer it right like
[4136.74 → 4142.38] because i we like i remember saying can we show blah blah I'm like um i guess yeah sure you can
[4142.38 → 4149.52] yeah you know all right well hey thank you guys very much for being here um thank you i think this is
[4149.52 → 4153.88] where you guys get to go get some dinner thank you hey we actually get to like handshake i love it
[4153.88 → 4159.38] each other in person yeah it's great to me too i don't know what the right is there a clean way
[4159.38 → 4166.68] to exit no, no no okay all right goodbye everybody thanks see you guys see ya bye guys drive safe uh
[4166.68 → 4174.02] safe travels and all that good stuff bye and i think now is a perfect time to mention that apparently
[4174.02 → 4182.90] you can actually buy that shirt that Ryan was wearing it is 63.15 according to dark 24 in the float
[4182.90 → 4190.50] plane chat i oh it's on the intel store i am bringing this up uh no it's discounted to 56
[4190.50 → 4195.30] dollars and 80 cents i don't know if you're aware of this but there it is there it is on the
[4195.30 → 4203.50] intel store.com which i did not even know was a thing it's called the intel arc raven jersey there
[4203.50 → 4209.70] you go all right so see you later i don't know how many of those you guys are going to actually sell

[4388.96 → 4397.34] check it out using the link down below what do you want to talk about first um i want to talk about
[4397.34 → 4402.94] our events yeah i guess we should, we have some big updates like kind of across the board if i deviate
[4402.94 → 4410.38] from the script i think i will actually nick light threatened to kick me in the teeth i think i have a
[4410.38 → 4421.58] James Bond pass a what a license to kill oh did he talk to you yeah i see we are doing a pop-up shop
[4421.58 → 4430.16] the LTT backpack is here uh Dan are you still here do you want to grab those backpacks they're behind
[4430.16 → 4441.00] you oh, oh they were hiding their black okay these are top of production first off the line units
[4441.00 → 4450.14] it's here but in very, very limited quantities there will be 250 pieces available tomorrow
[4450.14 → 4460.70] it will not be online it's one backpack per person, and it is in person only um are we announcing the
[4460.70 → 4466.60] address right now i guess we should right if it's in the dock just say what's in the dock say what's
[4466.60 → 4471.88] in the dock just say what's in the dock is this address right this doesn't look right um it is also
[4471.88 → 4479.32] on Twitter so you are fine it looks correct uh that's six digits that's too long oh is it unit 111 or
[4479.32 → 4487.22] something oh no it's unit six okay uh well I'm very nervous about this i think one of the 11s at the
[4487.22 → 4492.70] beginning is not there I'm going to check on yeah that would be great if you could just double-check
[4492.70 → 4499.74] that yeah okay anyway it's going to be in Richmond bc on ANSIs island uh the pop-up is around the back
[4499.74 → 4505.08] of the unit by the bay doors not where google will direct you this is not a meetup or a meet and
[4505.08 → 4511.42] greet it's an opportunity to be one of the first 250 people to buy the Ltd backpack Luke and i are
[4511.42 → 4518.54] not going to be there if you're not able to make it don't worry i am going to explain why we are doing
[4518.54 → 4524.06] this there's a business reason for doing this it actually cost us i think somewhere in the
[4524.06 → 4531.88] neighbourhood of 60 to 70 dollars per unit to have these 250 air shipped from the factory to us here
[4531.88 → 4538.76] so the rest of them well they're in production they're going to be shipped overseas, but it's
[4538.76 → 4546.86] going to take a while the problem is that we have had some cash flow challenges and this is a way for
[4546.86 → 4554.30] us to solve them without compromising our principles which is that we don't believe that people should
[4554.30 → 4561.64] pre-order something entirely sight unseen from you know essentially you're like we've never made a
[4561.64 → 4567.42] backpack before right like we're not talking this is the refreshed version of a thing you already
[4567.42 → 4574.06] had and already liked so we're trying to uh are we deviating from the so what we're doing is we are
[4574.06 → 4579.94] we air shipped in these units that we're not going to make nearly as much money on we're still making
[4579.94 → 4585.50] some margin we're not like losing our shirts here or anything like that, but we air shipped in 250 units
[4585.50 → 4593.90] we are going to sell them in person at the pop-up shop which is at 11 411 blacksmith place unit number
[4593.90 → 4602.28] six in Richmond and once people have bought it they can leave a review they can share their completely
[4602.28 → 4609.84] independent thoughts on it at that time it will not become a pre-order it will become a back order and we
[4609.84 → 4616.24] will open up web orders so you will be able to get in line so there will be legitimate 250 legitimate
[4616.24 → 4620.74] potential reviews from actual customers that actually own the product yes are able to bring
[4620.74 → 4625.50] it home is able to throw stuff on it bring it to school like people might not review it the second
[4625.50 → 4630.20] they buy it no they haven't used it yet so reviews are going to come up after people use it for maybe a
[4630.20 → 4635.64] week or two or whatever, but we need time to get stock anyway so it doesn't matter uh people are asking
[4635.64 → 4641.80] scalper protections uh one per customer, and it's in person uh it'll be fine I'm not expecting people
[4641.80 → 4646.70] to I'm not expecting people to scalp the backpack there's only so much you can do about scalp yeah
[4646.70 → 4652.20] and it's happening tomorrow morning we are intentionally giving people like 15 hours of
[4652.20 → 4659.18] notice what does this work out to yeah it'll be at 10 from 10 a.m to 12 noon it'll be 324.99
[4659.18 → 4668.10] Canadian plus tax, and it'll be again at 11 411 blacksmith place unit number six in Richmond it's
[4668.10 → 4676.36] also on Twitter like Luke said um oh okay nick says back orders will start shipping around the end of
[4676.36 → 4681.68] august pending any shipping delays which are very common right now and when you are there you will
[4681.68 → 4689.00] have the option to buy some other LTT gear and carry it away in your backpack if for whatever reason
[4689.00 → 4695.28] we don't have any backpacks left um which i think is unlikely we intentionally didn't give people a
[4695.28 → 4699.78] ton of notice so that they don't you know drop everything they're doing and book a flight or
[4699.78 → 4703.14] something like that's not what we want happening here you think we're not going to sell them all
[4703.14 → 4708.34] well i think it's i think it's possible i think it's also possible that we could have sold five times
[4708.34 → 4714.44] as many it's its impossible for me to gauge stuff like this i have no idea um, but we wanted to hedge
[4714.44 → 4720.36] our we wanted to err on the side of not giving people a ton of notice not doing it as a meetup or
[4720.36 → 4726.26] offering any other incentive for anybody to be there because there isn't a ton of parking like it's its
[4726.26 → 4732.12] very small very unofficial um but while you're there you will have the option to buy other LTT gear
[4732.12 → 4737.32] and if there isn't a backpack at the very least you can pick something else up and there'll be
[4737.32 → 4743.66] no shipping, but it's only for those two hours 10 a.m to noon no cash by the way someone asked
[4743.66 → 4749.38] about cash it is all in Canadian because we're putting up a location yeah i think legally
[4749.38 → 4755.36] we have to accept Canadian there's technically ways around it, but we are not doing those um
[4755.36 → 4760.72] because it's an online store blah blah blah, but it's its going to be in Canadian it's going to be
[4760.72 → 4767.10] in person and no cash it's just cards no screwdriver will not be there to those of you asking
[4767.10 → 4776.18] screwdriver is not ready yet like the design is done i actually got to show it to uh to tom and
[4776.18 → 4780.86] Ryan which was pretty fun because they were like wow this has been like a long time in the
[4780.86 → 4786.48] making and I'm like yeah two and a half years they're like oh wow but what was really cool was
[4786.48 → 4791.22] one of the things we're going to do for the screwdriver pop-up which we are planning is we're
[4791.22 → 4796.98] going to have competing drivers there yeah whether it's from Vera Klein snap-on we're going to have
[4796.98 → 4803.96] tons of competing drivers, and so we actually have those already we bought them uh because
[4803.96 → 4810.20] we're going to send them to us yeah, and so i was able to give them the one golden unit we have the
[4810.20 → 4815.78] one final unit we have with all the fixes applied and all these other drivers and be like so
[4815.78 → 4823.66] what do you think I'm not going to spoil it but I'm bullish on the launch I'll say that much
[4823.66 → 4832.30] all right uh when will the backorder open i don't think we have finalized exactly when backorders will
[4832.30 → 4839.18] open but if you've already signed up for a like an in-stock notification you will receive a notification
[4839.18 → 4845.84] that we are taking backorders so that tool is not super granular so it's just going to be like
[4845.84 → 4854.66] 54 000 emails or whatever yeah at once yeah if you get that email place your order because
[4854.66 → 4859.22] otherwise there is literally a snowball's chance in hell that you are getting one of the first
[4859.22 → 4866.80] cut like if you want something for back to school um you have to get on the first wave you make sure
[4866.80 → 4870.10] you're going to need to be on the first order i think they're going to be spaced out either
[4870.10 → 4877.84] a few weeks or a month apart after that each 10 000 units um so if you have something that
[4877.84 → 4881.64] you can limp along with for the first like week of school or something like that, but you want to
[4881.64 → 4887.68] have it for for for the start of the year is I'm not promising it'll actually be there
[4887.68 → 4892.72] start of the year um then you're going to want to be on that first wave all right
[4892.72 → 4899.78] people ask what about bots there are no bots it is in person it's in person it's in person cannot
[4899.78 → 4905.08] buy it online there you have to buy it with your face being there yeah we will not give you a second
[4905.08 → 4915.96] one it's very simple yeah all right what else do you want to talk about uh the other event updates
[4915.96 → 4921.88] oh do we have updates on the other event whale land there's a sneak peek of the event page which is
[4921.88 → 4927.32] oh really not actually that interesting oh okay well I'm going to bring it up anyway, but it's there
[4927.32 → 4936.76] oh my god this logo is awesome okay yeah so i did mean the page not the logo the page is just kind
[4936.76 → 4943.72] of sort of i mean it's a thing that's a map i guess, but the logo is super legit oh wow okay we're doing
[4943.72 → 4949.32] merch with that logo right i would certainly hope so yeah i believe we are I'm not certain though
[4949.32 → 4957.02] oh man but yeah updates for whale land there's a current event map there's that sneak peek of the
[4957.02 → 4961.32] event page which shows their super cool logo oh event map i want to see the event map i haven't even
[4961.32 → 4968.26] seen this is it any good tickets will go on sale Tuesday at 12 p.m next week we'll send out links
[4968.26 → 4973.56] to the event page on social media and the forum before tickets go live full ticket details will be
[4973.56 → 4979.72] available on the event page prior slash during ticket sales the regular ticket will be 100 Canadian
[4979.72 → 4988.44] dollars the whale ticket the whale ticket TBD going to be a lot uh the whole point is that it's a
[4988.44 → 4997.00] a whale ticket the numbers I've heard thrown around internally are not hundreds yeah yeah but regular
[4997.00 → 5002.32] tickets they get you they get you quite a bit i don't see exact details about what they get you here
[5002.32 → 5007.18] in regard to like deck desk space and stuff like that so i won't say them but i will say
[5007.18 → 5014.38] what I've seen so far spec'd out is a lot more than what you get at normal land um by the way massive
[5014.38 → 5022.28] shout-outs ubiquity fs.com and infinite cables uh those guys have actually sponsored us the gear that
[5022.28 → 5027.66] we need to run the event uh ubiquity sent over 20 network switches we are going to get 10 gig
[5027.66 → 5034.34] to each desktop switch so we're going to have almost full gig to every user super which is
[5034.34 → 5042.40] kind of cool yeah yeah kind of cool um fs.com sent all the transceivers that we need to connect them
[5042.40 → 5046.98] including some long distance transceivers because we're going to be going all the way from this
[5046.98 → 5052.80] building to that one for internet there's going to be a video about that i guarantee it and infinite
[5052.80 → 5059.20] cables sent literally thousands of feet of Ethernet patch cables so massive shout out to those
[5059.20 → 5066.66] guys really excited where's this page there's just a picture of it yeah it's just a picture of it yeah
[5066.66 → 5071.72] tickets did you say when tickets will go on sale yep Tuesday 12 p.m yeah and this one you can fly out
[5071.72 → 5076.98] for like this one yeah we're accepting online orders for tickets oh someone in float plane chat said if the
[5076.98 → 5089.24] price isn't 69 69 69 69 69 we will riot that's a pretty good idea yeah well there's also 6 000 uh 942
[5089.24 → 5095.68] cents yeah that's not bad either yeah yeah we'll see good we'll see guys we're we're definitely gonna
[5095.68 → 5102.48] so the point is not to rip off land the point is whale land, so one of the challenges is coming up with
[5102.48 → 5108.40] enough value add to justify charging that kind of price for a there's some really cool ideas but
[5108.40 → 5113.40] it's going to be unattainable for the vast majority of people which is why regular ticket while still
[5113.40 → 5118.16] not like the cheapest thing to do in a world it's a three-day event and like we have to rent all this
[5118.16 → 5124.92] all these tables and well it's like two days with like it bridges three days it does, but it's a two-day
[5124.92 → 5130.32] event i just want to clarify that okay yeah there's not much happening outside three days the two
[5130.32 → 5139.82] days yeah it happens over three days he's right yes all right what's next um your favourite
[5139.82 → 5146.04] topic of the night oh no really do we have to talk about that i think it's a fine I'm just it's
[5146.04 → 5153.60] to bring if it's just depressing uh unity acquires iron source an ad tech company uh the CEO of
[5153.60 → 5166.72] unity let me see here unity CEO john whoa Orissa t john I've heard his last name said before but i
[5166.72 → 5175.72] don't remember how to say it um he's a he used to be Ea CEO from 2007 to 2013 uh he has called people
[5175.72 → 5181.82] who make games for art instead of profit before the most beautiful pure and brilliant people, and he's
[5181.82 → 5188.20] also called them some of the biggest fucking idiots that exist so he's an interesting person
[5188.20 → 5193.98] um, and he's running the show over there, and he's integrating this ad company iron source which
[5193.98 → 5200.44] isn't just a random ad company because iron source has been caught doing lots of super super super
[5200.44 → 5208.78] shady things in the past um they are logged on a bunch of like malware tracking websites uh they've done
[5208.78 → 5216.50] really shady like uh clickjacking stuff they're they're like not exactly um the most clean you know
[5216.50 → 5225.12] ad company out there um iron source uh, so this also comes with them laying off uh we don't know how many
[5225.12 → 5231.98] people unity says just over 200 people or about four percent of its foremost firmer staff um but staff
[5231.98 → 5235.78] are saying it's more than that and people are guessing that it's around three to four hundred people so who
[5235.78 → 5240.98] knows um so they've laid off a bunch of people bought this company uh they've also been buying a
[5240.98 → 5246.68] ton of other companies because that is absolutely what you do when you lay people off the way to go
[5246.68 → 5252.32] in gaming right now is bought all the other companies gaming is consolidating as hard as it possibly can
[5252.32 → 5260.42] right now it's brutal um oh did it not work apparently not don't worry about it awesome um
[5260.42 → 5269.14] we should really just get go s go SLRs um uh what was I going to say yeah so they've recently bought
[5269.14 → 5277.12] diva dynamics in January a digital character creator uh pixie software a data handling company speed tree
[5277.12 → 5282.08] and environment developer parsec the whole remote desktop thing that we were talking about earlier in
[5282.08 → 5287.52] the show is now owned by unity uh wet digital a VFX platform and sync sketch a collaboration tool
[5287.52 → 5293.28] maker they have bought all of those uh fairly recently so they're trying to be uh like Microsoft
[5293.28 → 5303.42] and Sony and everybody else that's good for the industry yeah awesome um all right well i don't know
[5303.42 → 5309.78] what this means for the future of unity i mean bad things overall unity's perception in the gaming
[5309.78 → 5316.98] industry has still been pretty good i mean until now but yeah this could just be the first in a
[5316.98 → 5321.98] in a series of horrible moves only time will tell yeah unreal is dropping unreal 5 and like
[5321.98 → 5328.18] changing what people see as the future of video games uh fidelity wise and unity is trying to give
[5328.18 → 5338.22] you more ads yeah um which is neat i guess pretty cool uh Sony announces PlayStation stars loyalty
[5338.22 → 5342.94] program this is launching apparently later this year and is free to join, and you can earn rewards by
[5342.94 → 5346.70] completing campaigns and activities, so an example would be a monthly check-in campaign that
[5346.70 → 5351.40] requires you to play just any game to receive a reward kind of smacks of desperation but okay here
[5351.40 → 5355.76] we go there are other campaigns and activities including competing in tournaments earning specific
[5355.76 → 5361.46] trophies or being the first player in a particular time zone to platinum a blockbuster title that's
[5361.46 → 5367.24] cool PlayStation plus members earn more rewards than non-subscribers, and it does not replace Sony
[5367.24 → 5372.80] rewards the idea was to create a program that honours the role PlayStation may have had in someone's
[5372.80 → 5379.60] life well that's a really weird note i have no idea what that means what a lofty goal it's named after
[5379.60 → 5387.34] stars because stars are apparently unbound and limitless okay lining up with Sony's slogan play
[5387.34 → 5394.58] has no limits all right frankly this is feeling kind of cringe this is weird uh all PlayStation stars
[5394.58 → 5398.38] members will have the opportunity to earn loyalty points, and they can redeem them in a catalogue which
[5398.38 → 5403.82] may include PSN wallet funds and select PlayStation store products so in-game achievements essentially
[5403.82 → 5410.22] now have real value tied to them is it a matter of time until you can buy achievements so we have a
[5410.22 → 5415.86] cash achievement store that you can then redeem for PSN wallet funds and oh my goodness and all the
[5415.86 → 5422.50] currencies are just into it, we're going to have like a real-time like Sony currency exchange you
[5422.50 → 5427.60] know market i think some of the marketing around this is weird and cringe like you said earlier
[5427.60 → 5433.38] uh but i don't think it's a bad idea i think rewarding like they're talking about like a speed
[5433.38 → 5438.80] run to get to platinum a game in a certain time zone like rewarding players that are going to be that
[5438.80 → 5445.62] enthusiastic for your games i guess so it doesn't seem very scalable like i maybe reward the first
[5445.62 → 5450.64] thousand or something i don't know oh, but you just make a race and i mean they could do that in the
[5450.64 → 5455.62] future they could scale it up and they talked about how like there 's's i suspect there's
[5455.62 → 5460.74] going to be a variety of different types of rewards and those types of things um, but they're they're
[5460.74 → 5466.32] they're rewarding their super hardcore which makes sense to me float plane chat speculating that it's a
[5466.32 → 5475.10] matter of time before these they just are all NFTs um there's no indication if uh these digital
[5475.10 → 5481.76] collectibles that they are going to be able to reward people with can be traded or sold language
[5481.76 → 5487.78] used makes them sound a little bit like NFTs but Sony VP grace Chen says it is not leveraging any
[5487.78 → 5492.58] blockchain technology and definitely is not NFTs i mean we've talked about this before you can
[5492.58 → 5498.12] accomplish a lot of the things that people think about when they think of a NFT yes without
[5498.12 → 5502.32] using blockchain or anything like that and being way more energy efficient and all that type of stuff
[5502.32 → 5510.24] but just not using those types of security methods and i mean yeah totally unnecessary so
[5510.24 → 5515.18] sounds good great we've got perfect feedback from someone on twitch i think I've gotten over LTT
[5515.18 → 5521.08] I'll need to push this content away now it's the content is just too mainstream the old content was better
[5521.08 → 5529.44] yeah we went really mainstream talking about like ram latency and frequency trade-offs with ram with
[5529.44 → 5536.30] like you know the engineer who worked on XMP that was super mainstream definitely it was super
[5536.30 → 5539.76] mainstream to be clear you don't have to like the content like it's you know it's not for everybody
[5539.76 → 5545.44] but i don't think mainstream is the issue uh we should probably respond to some comments from people
[5545.44 → 5549.90] who sent merch messages do you want to hit us with some of those oh actually you know what we should
[5549.90 → 5555.52] really do is uh talk about whatever the LTT store thing that's going on this week is we had our
[5555.52 → 5560.26] guests on for so long we couldn't really what is it weaving this stuff into the rest of the video is
[5560.26 → 5564.74] it just the pop-up oh wait yeah i guess do we not have anything to talk about i think we did it
[5564.74 → 5568.98] i don't see it anywhere in here okay well in case anyone just needed to pick up something at the store
[5568.98 → 5575.16] and they wanted to send a merch message uh what do we get bell first one here from Joshua hey guys
[5575.16 → 5580.52] according to you over the years which company except intel has shown the most growth positively
[5580.52 → 5589.12] shown the most growth positively i wouldn't even necessarily you said except intel i don't
[5589.12 → 5595.58] think we were talking about it being growth with intel has always taken hits and still
[5595.58 → 5599.88] been there that that wasn't a growth point that was just something that they've always been good at
[5599.88 → 5612.22] um man that's really hard to say because i think most of the companies that have a super toxic
[5612.22 → 5619.66] culture that doesn't enable them to take feedback well uh it comes from the top you know and until
[5619.66 → 5624.14] there's a major it's not going to change leadership change yeah i mean I've only been in the industry for
[5624.14 → 5629.26] 10 years which is a long time, but it's well I'll get my 12 or 13 but it's its not a lifetime
[5629.26 → 5634.22] right so a lot of the companies that we work with still have exactly the same leadership they had
[5634.22 → 5640.66] when i started like corsair their founder, and he is still there in his office like um
[5640.66 → 5648.66] so companies that have a good culture like corsair like intel um and intel is less about that
[5648.66 → 5655.46] the same leadership is there and more that they've just grown far beyond any one individual being
[5655.46 → 5662.28] capable of moving the whole ship though i mean i would say a counterpoint to that is that pat
[5662.28 → 5667.26] has actually seemed to make an enormous difference I've almost shifted back and been like maybe it is
[5667.26 → 5671.92] intel even though they said except intel uh because they brought pat in um
[5671.92 → 5682.06] Noctua no Noctua has always been cool like the same and Samsung in a good way Samsung has always
[5682.06 → 5687.00] like Samsung seems cheated on benchmarks and gotten salty when they get caught like i don't know like
[5687.00 → 5691.32] it's just a lot of the companies are acting very similarly to how they did when i first started paying
[5691.32 → 5698.16] attention at least corsair is still trying to make everything in the world yeah um like they were
[5698.16 → 5703.16] trying to do that before they just have more of them now but like that is they yeah i don't it's i guess
[5703.16 → 5708.98] it depends on how you define growth um but yeah i think that was the context of it but i think so too
[5708.98 → 5715.42] what else you got for us from Ryan I'm wondering what you guys think of the podium one console
[5715.42 → 5721.16] and the graphics for them a quick three-word summary to give them would be NFT crypto console
[5721.16 → 5727.96] oh that thing yeah it's just stupid i don't know podium one it's just dumb it's an it's a web three it's
[5727.96 → 5733.96] just it's just dumb a console for web three gaming there's a dedicated button on your controller that
[5733.96 → 5741.76] is for your crypto wallet and like all this what yeah what even is it up to 120 frames per second
[5741.76 → 5749.64] yeah it's awesome i super cool love it when you see game console marketing that is up to some frame
[5749.64 → 5757.80] rate at what resolution at what render quality obviously you know not uh at this resolution
[5757.80 → 5764.34] obviously not with this on scroll down to it's a multichain console play games that are built on
[5764.34 → 5766.00] immutable x
[5766.00 → 5777.32] okay are these actual games this one's twice this one's listed twice
[5777.32 → 5786.92] um what one's listed twice uh grit is listed twice oh that's just like it's resuming
[5786.92 → 5792.10] oh okay yes it's not actually listed twice my favourite thing was just that the first
[5792.10 → 5796.80] app listed is wallet i just find that very entertaining a controller that is built for web
[5796.80 → 5802.16] three gaming yeah because it has a wallet button what does yeah what does that even, and it has like a
[5802.16 → 5807.04] bio biometric scanner i believe in order to unlock your wallet or something like that
[5807.04 → 5812.90] you need it when you're gaming it's like OUA but with blockchain look at this roadmap i stole that
[5812.90 → 5821.38] from AJ pulling pass p profile picture airdrop dude it's a web 3 project it has to have a roadmap
[5821.38 → 5829.68] that means basically nothing game tag claim why does that take a year it's been found to be a scam i
[5829.68 → 5835.62] believe says ducky Lewis NUMA i mean it was a scam regardless of whether they were actually going to
[5835.62 → 5841.66] build this thing no way estimated launch date 2024 oh it's not even a thing so it's just renders
[5841.66 → 5849.06] we are building it is will be worth the wait it's the future of gaming okay it is uh so what just what
[5849.06 → 5854.46] just happened i just the pulling pass will grant you access to the pulling ecosystem do you have to buy
[5854.46 → 5858.56] a NFT to get the pulling pass i don't know i don't even understand this i wish that oh yeah
[5858.56 → 5863.92] that'd be so awesome but no TBD no you can't even well it's a bad scam because you can't even
[5863.92 → 5875.52] do it okay well good luck with that uh why don't we jump into another topic uh oh no dr disrespect
[5875.52 → 5883.66] lets fans play test his game if they buy a NFT midnight society this is not a group of children
[5883.66 → 5889.30] in the woods telling stories uh released a roadmap for their new game codename project moon project
[5889.30 → 5896.62] moon will be a PVP VE fps that is created openly and transparently one snapshot build at a time that's
[5896.62 → 5904.88] going well for star Susan okay you went there snapshots will be vertical slices playable every six
[5904.88 → 5912.52] weeks exclusively available to access pass holders the original run of access passes called founders
[5912.52 → 5919.30] passes were supposedly sold at a cost of 50 to 10 000 people that is half millions of dollars that
[5919.30 → 5924.64] is that is half a million dollars boom they applied and filled out a form back in March the form was
[5924.64 → 5930.08] designed to keep scalpers away and included things like their social handles usernames on consoles and a
[5930.08 → 5936.90] questionnaire about their gaming experience and play style they claim they received 400 000 applications
[5936.90 → 5943.62] scamming people seems to be super lucrative should I get into it doesn't seem like it seems like it would
[5943.62 → 5949.48] be you know okay here's my deal okay if you want to win but win without morals it's quite easy yeah
[5949.48 → 5955.80] so I'll start scamming people okay i will double my money nice and I'll pay you another 10 to keep you
[5955.80 → 5960.48] quiet that's that's a pretty high percentage actually that seems like a good deal that's a lot
[5960.48 → 5965.10] yeah well no, no not 10 of the total I'm going to keep most of that 10 more than you have now oh that's i mean
[5965.10 → 5972.00] that's still pretty good okay yeah I'm not down though it's a good offer but i refuse the people
[5972.00 → 5977.80] out there that are taking this seriously because it's going to happen good gravy you guys an if i was
[5977.80 → 5984.40] actually considering this i wouldn't talk about it on the wan show okay and b no come on okay
[5984.40 → 5989.20] several people on Reddit have reported receiving their invitation to purchase those passes only in the
[5989.20 → 5993.94] last couple of weeks players that were not selected to receive an access pass are apparently able to
[5993.94 → 5999.52] purchase NFTs on the open market but a very quick search on open revealed no record of any selling
[5999.52 → 6005.12] yet feedback from access pass holders is then to be implemented in future builds of the game
[6005.12 → 6011.88] founders pass holders will apparently get invited to a party in la on July 29th oh wow that's only
[6011.88 → 6020.76] two weeks nice um so is this just 50 for early access to a game and some early bird perks
[6020.76 → 6030.86] and if so does it need to be NFTs does it need to be web 3 uh definitely doesn't um does it give you
[6030.86 → 6036.58] access to the game once it's out or do you just have the NFT proving that you were like an alpha
[6036.58 → 6047.62] member or whatever i do not know that is a wonderful question I'm not sure oh man uh in other news
[6047.62 → 6054.46] BMW it sucks so much because okay never mind we're not moving on sorry i just the game concept sounds
[6054.46 → 6062.02] cool and like when you hear dr d talk about shooters and stuff like that he's super knowledgeable he used
[6062.02 → 6067.86] to be a level designer yeah like he's with his guidance this game could be really awesome and then
[6067.86 → 6073.48] it's just being tainted for no good reason well i guess there is a reason maximum i don't necessarily
[6073.48 → 6078.60] agree that it's good he might think that it's good it's going to make a lot of money yeahs that's
[6078.60 → 6083.52] good from a business standpoint yeah so like and i get that part, but it's just like man like do you
[6083.52 → 6089.22] have to the whole like world is moving away from this stuff could you drop it can you drop it part
[6089.22 → 6093.98] way through like if can can you do NFTs for this part sure whatever you already committed to it just do
[6093.98 → 6099.12] it and then just drop it like don't have it be a part of the game launch that would be so much better
[6099.12 → 6104.58] please because it's probably going to be a great game unarmed toaster over on flow plane goes credit
[6104.58 → 6109.46] where credit is due the doc has picked the right combo to scam and make sure the government doesn't
[6109.46 → 6116.22] enforce any fraud laws crypto check video games check kickstarter check can we please get a tech
[6116.22 → 6124.90] scam bingo card in the LTT stuff yeah like man come on i just it could be so good and this year's
[6124.90 → 6129.14] actually been pretty good for gaming and like i know it's not coming out this year whatever but
[6129.14 → 6134.62] like we're kind of picking the roll up again we got some perfect launches this year there was a
[6134.62 → 6139.50] few kind of dead years there we're picking it back up again it would be great for this game to actually
[6139.50 → 6146.76] be perfect please just drop the like weird NFT crap and make it a good game all right there's one
[6146.76 → 6153.48] more thing i want to talk about before i play some minor VGA on stream
[6153.48 → 6164.42] okay uh what is it i want to talk about BMW requiring you to pay a subscription to use seat
[6164.42 → 6170.76] so didn't we talk about literally this yes but i don't years ago i didn't think we just guessed this
[6170.76 → 6174.56] though like when someone doing it already when someone linked me to this i was like wasn't this
[6174.56 → 6180.02] already a thing i don't think for BMW tesla was doing it yeah what tesla was doing subscriptions
[6180.02 → 6184.60] for seat warmers uh well i don't know if it was a subscription, but it was certainly and unlock you
[6184.60 → 6190.80] guys will have to you guys will have to let us know but yes it was absolutely a DLC anyway the
[6190.80 → 6196.84] latest version of this nonsense is that in South Korea BMW launched heated seats in their vehicles
[6196.84 → 6204.30] if you pay 18 a month this joins a host of other subscription features in their connected drive store
[6204.30 → 6208.80] that includes driving assistant plus high beam assist and others
[6208.80 → 6217.36] back in 2019 after BMW tried to put CarPlay and i believe android auto behind a subscription wall in
[6217.36 → 6224.38] the U.S. for 80 a year that is or 300 for 20 years they relented and made the feature standard on all new
[6224.38 → 6231.04] models what were you going to say uh i was just maybe it was one of the other features
[6231.04 → 6235.48] because they said they're adding it to their car play whatever thing so maybe it was some other
[6235.48 → 6239.86] feature we were talking about but i was like i was pretty sure we had talked about BMW and subscription
[6239.86 → 6245.48] stuff for their cars before uh but yeah i mean we've been telling everyone this is coming for
[6245.48 → 6252.62] the better part of a decade yeah i think this is one of the like oldest and most prolific
[6252.62 → 6261.34] like wan show uh, uh prophecies everything as a service yeah absolutely your entire life as a service
[6261.34 → 6265.28] you will never own anything you're not going to be allowed to own anything you will just subscribe to
[6265.28 → 6270.48] absolutely everything i mean i didn't even realize this but when jams bought his model 3
[6270.48 → 6277.90] it um the lease terms for tesla do not allow you to buy out the lease at the end of the term
[6277.90 → 6284.60] it goes back to tesla presumably to be part of their robot fleet or whatever meaning that when you
[6284.60 → 6294.58] lease a tesla you own absolutely nothing renting it yeah and that's a model that is going to
[6294.58 → 6300.94] be a thing and the reason that they are not allowing him to buy it out is so that that car can be used as
[6300.94 → 6305.76] a car as a service robot taxi essentially if they ever get their full self-driving figured out
[6305.76 → 6312.68] i didn't actually i didn't actually read the quote but apparently um daddy Elon was somewhat
[6312.68 → 6317.82] realistic about a self-driving update recently instead of just saying like it was yeah it's
[6317.82 → 6324.72] like right around the corner we got this um let's see apparently tesla also just lost their AI lead
[6324.72 → 6330.06] yes i saw that yeah that's pretty uh that's pretty rough apparently we have talked about specifically
[6330.06 → 6335.36] BMW seat warmers before we talked about it about a year ago oh all right well there you go yeah now we
[6335.36 → 6339.56] know i don't know if maybe we heard like a leak or something, and now it's actually here or
[6339.56 → 6347.24] what but yeah now it's time to play minor VGA that's right this is minecraft before minecraft
[6347.24 → 6354.18] you don't craft anything you just make money um oh okay if you press up here it goes you can't fly
[6354.18 → 6359.50] dummy there's a there's like a feed there's a feed here if you can you can see here if you
[6359.50 → 6364.40] want so you go up you try if you want to go down it says try the elevator i forget the buttons
[6364.40 → 6371.90] uh restoring your game i have to shook to see this oh what just happened i pressed c oh, oh wow broke
[6371.90 → 6378.98] it oh, oh wow okay restart this game here we go minor VGA i love those graphics um please wait
[6378.98 → 6385.12] while i load the sprite here we go here we go arrow keys to move the minor top bottom uh how do you so
[6385.12 → 6389.94] the reason why the reason why this is happening right now is Linus is getting confused about how to
[6389.94 → 6396.70] get into launch and play minecraft uh and his son had to give him some tech tips
[6396.70 → 6403.98] and he felt you know emasculated about it yeah so now he has to show that minor VGA
[6403.98 → 6414.16] is superior yeah okay d for drill p for pump water and uh and why to initiate uh a dynamite blast
[6414.16 → 6418.34] so let's let's remember all that yeah there's dynamite so do you have to like you said to make
[6418.34 → 6422.54] money do you have to like to buy stuff like dynamite so here's the store I'm definitely going to need a
[6422.54 → 6430.54] shovel so that is now in my inventory here um i will definitely need a pickaxe oh no, no money
[6430.54 → 6435.76] does not last very long oh do these things like break in this game durability uh yeah they will break
[6435.76 → 6446.22] um i will definitely need a bucket just in case and i don't remember everything else that i might
[6446.22 → 6451.96] need i don't remember what the point of the bar is what's the what's the looms closed water bucket
[6451.96 → 6459.50] for uh the water bucket is for in case it floods okay this will cash in your stuff so we're going to exit
[6459.50 → 6464.04] to leave the bank all right you guys enjoying this let's play we're playing some minor VGA here this is
[6464.04 → 6468.66] we're actually announcing right now that we're releasing a gaming channel uh it's not it's not
[6468.66 → 6472.42] going to be gaming news or anything like that it's just going to be Linus playing immediately people start
[6472.42 → 6477.40] subscribing on twitch no, no no, no no there's we're not this is not gaming okay so we're going to go
[6477.40 → 6482.14] oh, oh okay there was a bit of a cave in there we lost 14 of our health
[6482.14 → 6488.72] and it came what happens if you die is it just over uh okay i think i have already reached an um
[6488.72 → 6498.24] a non-progression scenario if you click into these like i don't know squiggly things uh it
[6498.24 → 6510.10] causes cave-ins so i granted is too hard to dig oh okay he died in the mine yeah I've only had
[6510.10 → 6517.42] granted is too hard to dig i cannot get back to the elevator so would you need dynamite to blast
[6517.42 → 6524.32] out of the way or uh yeah and i don't have any well too bad there are no microtransactions that allow
[6524.32 → 6528.88] me to i mean i guess we can dig for a bit longer you at least don't lose health when you try to dig
[6528.88 → 6541.66] granite here oh huh i can't believe how quickly that um got bad wait Luke you serious no I'm not serious
[6541.66 → 6548.18] we're not launching a gaming let's play God channel on YouTube anytime soon by the way you
[6548.18 → 6552.78] might have noticed at this point that my bank account goes down every time i move
[6552.78 → 6561.76] oh yeah we should tell dr disrespect about that oh god it flooded um that'd be really
[6561.76 → 6568.62] good for his game so I'm down to only I'm down to only 572 now i finally found one unit of silver
[6568.62 → 6574.58] oh i found nuggets of gold this is good this is good oh i got a cave-in but i found some gold
[6574.58 → 6580.26] silver oh my goodness more silver oh wow oh I've actually got some stuff it would be
[6580.26 → 6585.14] really oh my goodness you can't go through the surface at all you have to go through the elevator
[6585.14 → 6594.42] oh absolutely i might not have enough money to get around this um flood hold on oh my okay all right
[6594.42 → 6600.86] if we can find a way does anybody know how to get back in the elevator because that would be great
[6600.86 → 6607.18] maybe we can we pickaxe this thing do you remember the do you remember the uh i never played
[6607.18 → 6616.34] these buttons' no but i said remember something oh uh no um has anyone ever heard of
[6616.34 → 6625.98] this game before i remember v being one of the key binds uh minor VGA uh key binds uh yeah i can't
[6625.98 → 6636.14] i can't uh i can't get back to the elevator go to the bottom and press b no, no that's not anything
[6636.14 → 6644.76] i googled minor VGA key binds and one of the first results was the star citizen alpha controls and key bindings
[6644.76 → 6652.68] nice that's very funny nice oh you need to give us the kickstarter hammer update
[6652.68 → 6660.84] oh it was a no no tell us about it tell us about okay after the stream last time Luke was like
[6660.84 → 6665.96] holy crap there's an actual update can you bring it up uh i can work on that if you want to keep
[6665.96 → 6673.64] playing minor VGA for a bit um i mean yeah I'm down to play some minor VGA I'm going to go ahead and
[6673.64 → 6678.42] take another crack at this if that's okay with everyone yeah i love this your health was 30
[6678.42 → 6684.46] your final account balance was 148 thanks for playing minor VGA hope you had a good time may
[6684.46 → 6695.94] the hair on your toes never fall off Frodo press any key continue oh i love it oh man okay all right
[6695.94 → 6704.82] guys we are going to need to get some dynamite this time and dynamite is why how do i place dynamite
[6704.82 → 6712.88] that's not clear okay p for pump water d for drill granite all right we got this is it possible that
[6712.88 → 6718.38] buy in place is the same key bind yes that's entirely possible so we're gonna head to the store
[6718.38 → 6724.56] we definitely need a shovel that makes your digging much easier uh we know I'm going to get a drill
[6724.56 → 6733.22] instead of a pickaxe this time a durable drill sir uh okay dynamite is 300 though you guys saw how
[6733.22 → 6739.00] much digging i had to do to find any silver like I'm gonna if i buy all the equipment I'm going to run out
[6739.00 → 6744.12] of money I'm gonna before i even find a single thing that i can cash in I'm going to show you my
[6744.12 → 6751.28] password for this kickstarter thing so i make my cast passwords uh phrases right i can't say it out
[6751.28 → 6756.64] loud for obvious reasons, but there'll be there'll often be something i either said recently or thought
[6756.64 → 6762.06] or heard or whatever yes um and i just this one just made me laugh i didn't know that was the password
[6762.06 → 6770.76] you guys won't get to know what it is, but it's very funny oh my goodness how rude apparently i don't
[6770.76 → 6777.28] know what was going on i don't remember making that you know what I'm going to fly close to the sun again
[6777.28 → 6784.20] I'm not buying dynamite i can't afford it oh okay we're going to go down a little deeper this time
[6784.20 → 6789.22] and we're gonna kind of we're gonna kind of clear out some oh my goodness the way it reloads like that
[6789.22 → 6795.58] we're going to try to clear out some space next to the uh elevator shaft here oh we found streaks of
[6795.58 → 6801.14] silver six silver okay granite is too hard to dig okay we're going to try and drill the granite though
[6801.14 → 6809.00] oh yeah we drilled that granite it's done got drilled oh it costs money to drill granite though
[6809.00 → 6816.94] maybe we just don't drill granite sandstone easy digging I'm down to 458 dollars and i have seven
[6816.94 → 6823.52] oh i found gold crap so does that automatically pay you or do you have to go sell it you have to
[6823.52 → 6829.66] go sell it the spring is terrible i hit it twice because i didn't react in time, and it filled up with
[6829.66 → 6839.60] more water springs are awful, and you can like to pump the water out, but it's very expensive and
[6839.60 → 6845.74] there's a good chance you'll die okay we've got a cave in here okay, but we survived i have 72 health
[6845.74 → 6851.38] and I'm down to nine dollars in my bank account that is as far as i explored we need to go to the
[6851.38 → 6856.58] bank, and we need to see how much we can sell these streaks of silver and nuggets of gold for
[6856.58 → 6864.50] all right I've got it by the way we have 485 okay well why don't you give the update while i continue
[6864.50 → 6870.90] to try to stay alive here so we have the coal bar hammer update it's kind of like sad and somewhat
[6870.90 → 6876.84] of a and somewhat of a nothingburger um it's so I'll go over if it's i was rooting for the coal
[6876.84 → 6884.60] bar it's been i there is progress really there is well theoretically theoretical progress
[6884.60 → 6891.18] we'll talk about there was regression and then there was re re re progress i should say
[6891.18 → 6896.16] they re pronged seriously so hello everyone i don't know i don't think I'm going to read the whole
[6896.16 → 6902.30] thing it's like really long um i think you should read the whole thing okay fine hello uh we're back
[6902.30 → 6908.36] is the name of the update this update number 93 uh this is we are now in the year 2022 just because
[6908.36 → 6916.32] you didn't know i backed this i believe like 2012 2013 around there wow um hello everyone well it's
[6916.32 → 6921.02] been ages since the last update not going to beat around the bush but covet absolutely killed us
[6921.02 → 6925.64] we were all ready to go with the new gears and positive outcome with unofficial load testing
[6925.64 → 6931.42] uh, but then we were dropped by modern forge which was they're the forge company they're going to work
[6931.42 → 6937.96] with so the people that were going to make it right dropped them um in addition my wife and myself
[6937.96 → 6944.24] were very ill with covid to the point where we both were deathly ill especially my wife who at one
[6944.24 → 6950.76] point i thought we lost i won't go into detail, but it was bad very, very bad it has taken us months to
[6950.76 → 6956.22] recover in our personal and financial lives' oh wow i thought it might be over for coal bar as we
[6956.22 → 6961.10] could not find any forging facilities that would take us on we wanted to keep everything U.S. based
[6961.10 → 6968.14] but everyone was and is in the same boat labour and raw material shortages, and it just ends there but
[6968.14 → 6973.76] you know what i mean uh we even searched Canada and Mexico to no avail i thought we would uh have to
[6973.76 → 6978.28] wait until everything got back to normal, but we finally found an outfit willing to help it was a small
[6978.28 → 6984.92] miracle um as it is virtually impossible for startups to get forging our new facility is i don't know if
[6984.92 → 6992.22] he should have name-dropped the person in here oh um, but he did so our new facility is Green Bay drop
[6992.22 → 6998.72] forge in WI which i think is Wisconsin yep um our contact there is i don't know I'm going to skip that
[6998.72 → 7004.68] it's on-screen whatever uh Scott Stutsman um please don't be mean seriously
[7004.68 → 7011.08] they've been through they're like they've been through a lot they don't like yeah first
[7011.08 → 7016.74] don't troll the coal bar hammer people and also don't troll their forge people like yeah just leave
[7016.74 → 7023.42] them alone we shouldn't have to say that, but we do for yeah we all owe him Scott a great deal of uh
[7023.42 → 7029.26] gratitude as cold bar would be dead in the water if it weren't for him and GDF uh we have assembled
[7029.26 → 7033.70] the new team which i will introduce in another update uh we have some of the same team members
[7033.70 → 7038.08] but also some new faces as we give this thing another shot because they kind of they have to
[7038.08 → 7044.08] semi reorg all these updates are super long every single one's like massive um they have to semi reorg
[7044.08 → 7050.52] because it's been like i think over a year since they had that previous forging partner etc right um
[7050.52 → 7057.50] as far as updates go I'm no longer updating unless we have something concrete to share
[7057.50 → 7065.78] uh there don't be mean but them updates have been pretty far apart uh there has just been too
[7065.78 → 7072.60] much negativity and outright harassment and this is probably kind of true um of me and my family i just
[7072.60 → 7078.48] can't take that anymore so i will simply be posting updates as things happen but most likely won't be
[7078.48 → 7084.50] commenting case in point, and then he shows some screenshots of uh some comments that happened on
[7084.50 → 7091.34] the kickstarter somebody who renamed their account never getting my coal bar um he said if anyone wants
[7091.34 → 7097.06] to update their profile picture with sad coal with a sad coal here's the image look at that i just
[7097.06 → 7102.18] provided more than this project ever has i mean i understand people being upset about not getting it but
[7102.18 → 7108.62] yeah at this point um there was another rough one so he posted that a few times, and then he posted
[7108.62 → 7115.06] uh this was started in 2013 at the current decay rate of human tissue I'm fairly certain coal's body
[7115.06 → 7120.96] will be considered human compost by the time anything is, and then it trails off yeah so it got a lot more
[7120.96 → 7127.62] negative clearly unnecessary um the like picture is like pretty bad that last one that i just read is
[7127.62 → 7135.36] like way too far, and you should not do that stuff that's really stupid um moving on from there uh he
[7135.36 → 7140.18] said i can't even begin to tell you how long is this we're almost done this is why i said i didn't
[7140.18 → 7144.36] want to read the whole thing all right um i can't even begin to tell you how this broke my father's heart
[7144.36 → 7149.22] but this is the reason we don't update much unless we have something uh after what we've been through
[7149.22 → 7153.26] over the last couple of years i just don't have the mental capacity right now i will be delegating some of the
[7153.26 → 7158.88] updating responsibilities as well so i can focus on pre-production uh we have more updates with the
[7158.88 → 7164.00] forging process now that we have another opportunity produce the to produce the coal bar thank you for
[7164.00 → 7168.72] your time i mean this is one of those things where at a certain there's like a there's like a how
[7168.72 → 7174.16] understanding i am scale, and it starts very high because you don't expect anything immediately
[7174.16 → 7179.02] and then it goes very low because it's like time to deliver the product, and then it actually starts
[7179.02 → 7184.26] to go up again because if they're still trying after all that time that's you got to kind of
[7184.26 → 7188.44] respect the hustle that's kind of how i feel about it because i have been legitimately burned on a
[7188.44 → 7194.90] couple's yeah Kickstarter oh me too i literally got one person who like i asked for a refund he's
[7194.90 → 7200.90] just like no i was like, but you didn't do it, and he's like yeah and like he didn't try it was this
[7200.90 → 7205.02] was like one month afterwards he's like yeah I'm not making it even though he passed his goal
[7205.02 → 7211.58] he just gave up immediately and was like I'm keeping the money it was just like okay this is
[7211.58 → 7217.04] like a decade later yeah like eight years or something like that why would they still be
[7217.04 → 7222.02] posting updates if they weren't trying, and they're like they're like naming forging companies that like
[7222.02 → 7227.36] people could follow don't, but people could follow through on and like verify our real companies that
[7227.36 → 7232.96] actually have this contract and stuff yeah like it's its they are actually doing something um
[7232.96 → 7242.08] i am not i don't like believe I'm ever going to hold a coal bar hammer yeah but like at this point
[7242.08 → 7248.52] like they tried even if they do completely fail i don't like i feel a lot worse about the ones where
[7248.52 → 7253.18] i just genuinely got burned on it, i knew the whole time going into kickstarter that these aren't
[7253.18 → 7259.40] guaranteed products and with this one like i there was some blood sweat and tears put into
[7259.40 → 7262.84] it is so like yeah yeah i mean if they were still taking money that would be a problem
[7262.84 → 7267.92] yeah, but they're not and that some Kickstarter do that they'll like to finish their kickstarter and
[7267.92 → 7271.60] then open up another website to continue taking pre-orders and stuff and then still not deliver
[7271.60 → 7275.40] yep um they didn't do that so yeah i don't know I'm uh
[7275.40 → 7281.92] it's sad that the update was so sad but i hope we have some good ones in the future here's my update
[7281.92 → 7287.24] i have 17 left in my bank account my health is at 49 and i bumped into this spring
[7287.24 → 7293.04] i have no minerals whatsoever so even in the event that i do manage to get back to the elevator
[7293.04 → 7302.18] oh i got a caved in on okay there's a spring um I'm dead so you just die when you run out of money
[7302.18 → 7313.24] yeah this game is hard mode and so unfair there's a lot of springs yeah yeah yeah it's um
[7313.24 → 7321.48] all right I'm taking one last attempt one last attempt at minor VGA here we go here we go all
[7321.48 → 7326.12] right game streaming we is there more merch messages no okay
[7326.12 → 7333.08] a lot of people saying we should buy coal bar and just make that our next hardware re-release
[7333.08 → 7341.50] it's its actually really hard like from reading the updates over the years some of
[7341.50 → 7346.30] the stuff that they have to go through is like tough i mean we know from doing the screwdriver
[7346.30 → 7353.34] like just because something is seemingly simple but like this is a collapsible and take a
[7353.34 → 7358.80] portable hammer that turns into a crowbar yeah no i know the destruction tool so it has to be like
[7358.80 → 7365.88] load bearing and stuff i know like it's its actually difficult i found some platinum this is
[7365.88 → 7370.54] good news are you a baller should you just go sell it to make sure that you don't like die prematurely
[7370.54 → 7377.26] um yeah i did oh okay yeah i sold it already so now I'm going to go to the general store wait
[7377.26 → 7385.26] why do i have I pressed r and restored my last game i no longer have the platinum what if i am again
[7385.26 → 7392.54] the drama oh crap i have only 850 dollars oh this sucks
[7392.54 → 7397.40] oh, oh what is this game called again minor what wait
[7397.40 → 7405.56] you need the need the stupid uh i think the lantern is what does this it makes it so that if you
[7405.56 → 7412.16] move around you get a preview of what's there, but you have to like move close to it oh over and
[7412.16 → 7417.64] over again or something oh my goodness another spring freaking i was going to do a is rocket
[7417.64 → 7423.24] league yell but i didn't know the name of the game so, and now it's been too long but just imagine that
[7423.24 → 7429.20] it happened okay right is it the lantern or the torch that like tells you there's something there
[7429.20 → 7435.30] uh okay and then if i want to know what it is i just you have to i think you have to like move around a
[7435.30 → 7442.94] lot patience is the name of this game doesn't just burn all your money no it only costs money to
[7442.94 → 7450.38] actually dig oh to new tiles' oh silver nice oh my god when it has to redraw the whole page like that
[7450.38 → 7456.18] when you go up and down over a certain threshold yeah yeah it's pretty brutal okay we've got
[7456.18 → 7465.94] 11 silvers oh, oh this is looking promising here's some gold here's some platinum oh one platinum
[7465.94 → 7475.58] okay this is definitely the way, and we avoided that cave in by moving around near it oh there's lots
[7475.58 → 7479.80] oh my goodness there's lots of stuff around here we have to go down this corridor here okay we got some
[7479.80 → 7487.86] sandstone got some easy digging there oh I'm liking it guys we are going to win this we are going to win
[7487.86 → 7497.72] minor VGA ask me how you win how do you win you don't oh is it i mean it might be possible
[7497.72 → 7504.88] what if you uncovered every single square uh you can buy more mineshaft like infinitely i don't know if
[7504.88 → 7511.04] it's infinite, but you can certainly buy more and then the more mineshaft you have the more obviously
[7511.04 → 7517.36] you can dig and the more you dig, the more money you can make this is like a high score game so you go
[7517.36 → 7521.74] for that you go for the highest possible score you know you wouldn't really understand because you
[7521.74 → 7526.98] don't really get like high scores in games because you're just not very good at games but like it's um
[7526.98 → 7531.36] it's kind of like where you try to be the best you can at a game and there's no real like cap on it
[7531.36 → 7537.18] there's no completion it's not like assassin's creed you know oh okay I'm trolling Luke's a much
[7537.18 → 7545.02] better gamer than me like by a long shot it's not even close i actually really enjoyed oh did you did
[7545.02 → 7552.18] you know i had a YouTube channel that wasn't that keyboard unboxing do you even know about this
[7552.18 → 7558.60] i don't know if i know about this i had an assassin's creed uh advanced difficulty tutorial channel
[7558.60 → 7566.34] shut up legitimately okay so for assassin's creed 2 and this was back when like recording your
[7566.34 → 7570.76] gameplay was like rough, and they're like actually wasn't a lot of let's play stuff on YouTube how'd
[7570.76 → 7577.82] you do it i don't even fully remember i think it was like fraps based or something um okay like it was
[7577.82 → 7584.32] kind of like tough um but i used to do so there used to be these things i think it's called synchronization
[7584.32 → 7590.00] where like the idea in assassin's creed is that you're you're reliving like memories of your
[7590.00 → 7596.76] ancestors right well i don't know what it is anymore, but that's what it was um and the
[7596.76 → 7602.28] synchronization is like doing it in the same way that your ancestor would have done it there's certain
[7602.28 → 7606.60] things that will break synchronization like if you kill civilians it will like to fail the mission
[7606.60 → 7610.64] because it's like oh that you broke synchronization by doing this, but there's certain
[7610.64 → 7616.40] like harder difficulty things that is like oh this is how they did it or whatever um, and you can play
[7616.40 → 7619.66] through the game without getting essentially any of those i think a lot of people will somewhat
[7619.66 → 7624.40] automatically probably get like 40 to 50 percent uh but some of them are actually like genuinely really
[7624.40 → 7631.38] hard so i made like little individual mission lets plays essentially that explained how to get
[7631.38 → 7639.38] like 100 synchronization um they're all gone they're definitely all gone, but that is a thing that i did
[7639.38 → 7646.62] yeah i had a few different YouTube channels welcome to saint woody's we are pleased to take care of you
[7646.62 → 7653.20] in god we trust all others pay cash no insurance accepted what type of service do you want is this
[7653.20 → 7659.62] the bar you may be in need of surgery your bed rest will probably be about 5.1 days our fees are quite
[7659.62 → 7666.72] reasonable press a to stay until mostly healed press d to stay one day and night press s for surgical
[7666.72 → 7673.74] procedures 300 300 i have a thousand bucks from everything that i sold
[7673.74 → 7684.14] why are your videos gone anyway i just deleted the channel oh really yeah who does that um
[7684.14 → 7688.08] you apparently but why yeah i don't know why i did
[7688.08 → 7693.68] take two aspirin and don't call they say okay
[7693.68 → 7701.48] minor VGA I'm going pro oh i got three platinum you know what I'm going to go sell that right away
[7701.48 → 7707.98] because i only have 771 dollars and that is just not enough to guarantee that I'm going to stay alive
[7707.98 → 7713.84] some silver too though okay i got some silver that's never had a good game that's a terrible take
[7713.84 → 7718.18] what never had a good game Conrad's trying to say that assassin's creed never had a good game
[7718.18 → 7721.66] wasn't like assassin's creed 2 like assassin's creed 2 is an amazing game
[7721.66 → 7727.46] wow i think you are like ready to fight aren't you it's just it's just a bad take
[7727.46 → 7733.84] wow he calls himself a game reviewer it's like what a what a know all game reviewers one
[7733.84 → 7740.10] bucket dude you're in it wow i think Luke's ready to fight I'm kidding I'm kidding
[7740.10 → 7745.44] the vast majority of assassin's creed games are kind of trash remember unity remember how
[7745.44 → 7749.94] unplayable unity was nope didn't play it for like six generations oh crap i just accidentally
[7749.94 → 7751.34] it was finally playable again
[7751.34 → 7760.78] this uh play through may actually take too long to do here because I'm i have figured out how to stay
[7760.78 → 7767.84] alive it's after eight they have uh they have um would you call it candy it's a chocolate
[7767.84 → 7774.78] yeah they have a have a candy named after this time of day uh-huh which has something to do
[7774.78 → 7781.84] with anything because i have work to do oh i see yeah, yeah okay so we're going to call it we're gonna
[7781.84 → 7791.48] call it on the minor VGA uh let's play um but yeah minor VGA on playdosgames.com you too can enjoy
[7791.48 → 7795.04] uh this snippet of my childhood
