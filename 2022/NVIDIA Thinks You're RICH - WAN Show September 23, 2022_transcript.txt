[0.00 --> 7.52]  What is up? How y'all doing? Happy Friday and welcome to the WAN show.
[7.62 --> 10.36]  We've got a bunch of great topics for you today, actually.
[11.04 --> 17.12]  In the biggest news from this week, NVIDIA figures you are made of money.
[17.34 --> 18.10]  Just tons of it.
[18.16 --> 19.06]  Just lots of it.
[19.26 --> 19.74]  Coming out of everywhere.
[19.74 --> 22.62]  It's coming out of every orifice simultaneously.
[23.04 --> 27.40]  You have money diarrhea, money vomit, money ear drips.
[27.96 --> 28.10]  Yeah.
[28.22 --> 29.28]  Yeah, you know, money.
[29.28 --> 31.96]  You have coin tears.
[32.04 --> 33.32]  Money sinus infection.
[33.62 --> 34.54]  Yeah, coins probably aren't worth enough.
[34.56 --> 35.74]  Getting all over everything.
[36.04 --> 41.90]  So we'll be talking about their announcement for the RTX 4000 series of graphics cards,
[42.10 --> 47.16]  along with some alternatives that might cost you a little bit less money.
[47.24 --> 48.06]  We've got some ideas.
[48.88 --> 53.68]  In other, you have too much money and not enough brains news.
[54.18 --> 54.64]  Logitech.
[54.64 --> 55.56]  I know where this is going.
[55.56 --> 60.80]  Logitech just launched the, what is this stupid thing called?
[60.88 --> 62.90]  The G Cloud Gaming Handheld.
[62.90 --> 65.40]  I have, I think, at least a single use case for it.
[65.48 --> 66.64]  So we'll talk about that later.
[66.74 --> 67.66]  I will fight you.
[67.74 --> 68.44]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[68.50 --> 69.14]  I will fight you.
[69.20 --> 71.54]  I don't care how magnificent your hair looks.
[71.82 --> 73.04]  I will fight you.
[73.04 --> 77.30]  I spent an actually significant amount of time trying to find a way to make this work.
[77.66 --> 78.14]  All right.
[78.14 --> 78.80]  What else we got?
[79.08 --> 83.86]  We have something that's kind of interesting for us, which is YouTube adding shorts views
[83.86 --> 85.02]  to their partner program.
[85.24 --> 86.66]  That's actually a big deal.
[86.80 --> 88.72]  If you view anything on YouTube, we will talk about why.
[88.72 --> 89.28]  Like for the industry.
[89.70 --> 89.98]  Yes.
[90.32 --> 90.52]  Yep.
[90.52 --> 93.96]  And where do I go from here?
[94.04 --> 95.12]  There's a couple different options.
[95.40 --> 95.42]  What?
[95.42 --> 96.88]  Not LTT on Espanol?
[97.68 --> 97.96]  Sure.
[98.04 --> 98.62]  Yeah, let's do it.
[99.10 --> 99.42]  Yeah.
[99.56 --> 100.68]  I know nothing about this.
[100.76 --> 102.48]  I mean, there's all the Twitch drama, I guess.
[102.82 --> 103.04]  Yeah.
[103.24 --> 103.98]  It was like that.
[104.00 --> 105.96]  Or do I talk about Video Game Donkey?
[107.30 --> 108.60]  Which we're going to talk about.
[108.70 --> 108.98]  All right.
[109.00 --> 109.66]  Let's roll the intro.
[109.70 --> 110.56]  We're going to talk about a lot of stuff.
[110.64 --> 110.80]  Yeah.
[110.80 --> 111.30]  It's going to be good.
[111.36 --> 111.80]  You'll like it.
[111.86 --> 112.00]  Yeah.
[112.00 --> 112.14]  Yeah.
[112.14 --> 112.24]  Yeah.
[112.24 --> 112.28]  Yeah.
[112.28 --> 112.30]  Yeah.
[112.30 --> 112.32]  Yeah.
[112.32 --> 112.34]  Yeah.
[112.34 --> 112.90]  Yeah.
[112.90 --> 114.20]  Yeah.
[114.20 --> 114.28]  Yeah.
[114.28 --> 114.34]  Yeah.
[114.34 --> 116.24]  Yeah.
[116.24 --> 116.28]  Yeah.
[116.28 --> 120.50]  Yeah.
[120.52 --> 134.20]  Have a good one, Dan.
[134.58 --> 138.62]  The show is brought to you by Shadow Kioxia and Epidemic Sound.
[140.02 --> 140.64]  All right.
[140.64 --> 142.48]  First of all, let's get this out of the way.
[142.94 --> 143.24]  Yes.
[143.38 --> 150.08]  Can confirm for those of you asking the unnamed major YouTube YouTuber that we sponsored to
[150.08 --> 154.92]  do a video about the LTT screwdriver or featuring the LTT screwdriver was Marquez.
[155.14 --> 160.08]  I actually ran into him at a summit over the last couple of days.
[160.16 --> 162.76]  It's over now, so I guess I can say that it took place.
[163.34 --> 168.04]  But we were chatting about it, and I think we're both pretty darn pleased overall.
[168.60 --> 171.88]  Like, the community reaction to it was just like, what?
[172.28 --> 173.36]  This is hilarious.
[173.58 --> 174.16]  I love it.
[174.16 --> 174.60]  Yeah.
[174.60 --> 180.30]  And, you know, I think for both of us, it was not an obvious outcome.
[181.00 --> 181.28]  Yeah.
[181.28 --> 181.84]  Yeah.
[181.94 --> 187.60]  It could have very easily been like, I don't come on MKBHD to see Linus stuff.
[187.60 --> 188.34]  To see them computers.
[188.78 --> 189.00]  Yeah.
[189.06 --> 193.04]  Or like, what are you doing sponsoring other YouTubers?
[193.16 --> 194.66]  He doesn't even build computers all the time.
[194.80 --> 196.06]  You never know, right?
[196.06 --> 200.08]  Like, there could be any number of wild interpretations of what was going on.
[200.16 --> 204.84]  But from, you know, my point of view, and I think from his, it was actually pretty simple.
[205.02 --> 210.54]  It was a collab in the sense that there was a cross-pollination between the channels, between the audiences.
[210.88 --> 216.60]  But also, we did sponsor the video, which is not really any different from what anyone else would do.
[217.18 --> 220.50]  And from my point of view, I just wanted to see him do a computer build again.
[220.56 --> 222.08]  Because it had been almost 10 years.
[222.46 --> 222.64]  Yeah.
[222.74 --> 224.24]  It had been almost 10 years.
[224.38 --> 224.92]  It's been a hot minute.
[224.92 --> 227.92]  Yeah, the last time he did it was a Hackintosh.
[228.56 --> 229.16]  That makes sense.
[229.24 --> 232.38]  Which is like, it's clearly been long enough that Apple's over it.
[232.90 --> 235.34]  So that'll give you some idea, right?
[235.58 --> 235.62]  Yeah.
[235.86 --> 236.02]  Yeah.
[236.58 --> 239.46]  So yeah, it was pretty fun.
[239.54 --> 240.60]  It was pretty cool overall.
[240.80 --> 243.86]  It was a pleasure working with their team, and that's what it was.
[244.36 --> 250.20]  And don't be surprised if you see the screwdriver popping up in other places.
[250.20 --> 256.60]  Zach from JerryRigEverything has already had his Creator Edition screwdriver make a little cameo.
[257.16 --> 260.70]  And you'll see a lot more than that if we get our way.
[260.90 --> 262.70]  Obviously, we think it's a really great screwdriver.
[262.84 --> 264.06]  We have sent it out to a bunch of people.
[264.14 --> 267.10]  They're under no obligation to show it in any way.
[267.26 --> 269.86]  But obviously, you know, we'd feel the love.
[269.86 --> 273.12]  So that's pretty cool, I guess.
[273.28 --> 277.10]  And I figure after that, we've got to jump right into the big topic, right?
[277.22 --> 277.50]  Yes.
[277.94 --> 279.52]  NVIDIA figures what?
[280.02 --> 280.98]  You guys have a lot of money.
[281.08 --> 282.38]  You should buy more merch, I guess.
[282.38 --> 284.40]  Well, let's talk about this, right?
[284.40 --> 286.80]  Because what is the rationale here?
[287.14 --> 287.30]  Okay.
[287.42 --> 289.08]  So, okay.
[289.12 --> 289.86]  Let's role play.
[290.16 --> 290.44]  Okay.
[291.02 --> 293.60]  I'm going to be NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.
[293.98 --> 294.20]  Okay?
[294.34 --> 294.60]  Wow.
[294.72 --> 296.68]  You are fantastically wealthy.
[296.78 --> 297.56]  You're going to be a gamer.
[297.96 --> 298.18]  Okay?
[298.18 --> 299.26]  You have a beautiful kitchen.
[300.32 --> 301.68]  And a nice jacket.
[301.68 --> 304.74]  Yeah, I was going to say, you haven't even complimented my jacket.
[305.26 --> 305.54]  Okay?
[305.82 --> 308.96]  So, I'm NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.
[309.24 --> 316.58]  And I'm going to try and sell you on the RTX 4090, which is coming on October 12th.
[316.62 --> 317.36]  It's going to be hard to do.
[317.36 --> 322.10]  It looks like it is going to be shockingly fast.
[322.54 --> 323.86]  Some cool new features.
[323.98 --> 325.88]  DLSS 3.0.
[326.34 --> 328.96]  How many freaking CUDA cores does this thing have?
[329.00 --> 329.28]  I don't know.
[329.34 --> 332.30]  We don't actually have like a spec chart here.
[332.44 --> 334.22]  And I don't remember off the top of my head.
[334.60 --> 336.24]  But, oh, yeah.
[336.28 --> 336.68]  Here we go.
[336.72 --> 337.08]  Here we go.
[337.12 --> 337.44]  Here we go.
[337.48 --> 339.20]  We got some images on the LTT forum.
[339.30 --> 340.40]  Hey, massive shout out.
[340.48 --> 344.38]  Big strewns on the LTT forum for posting this.
[344.38 --> 350.78]  They're saying up to 2x to 3x the performance of the 30.
[350.90 --> 356.66]  Oh, 2 to 4x the performance of the 3090 Ti.
[357.60 --> 360.40]  24 gigs of GDDR6 memory.
[361.22 --> 363.06]  Where's my CUDA cores at?
[363.12 --> 363.24]  Yeah.
[363.32 --> 363.74]  Here we go.
[363.80 --> 364.12]  Here we go.
[364.20 --> 365.56]  Compare 40 series specs.
[365.64 --> 365.96]  Here we go.
[366.00 --> 368.38]  Let's just go ahead and show my screen for a minute here.
[368.38 --> 372.86]  4090, 16,384 CUDA cores.
[372.98 --> 375.58]  2.5 gigahertz boost clock.
[376.08 --> 377.28]  That's unreal.
[377.74 --> 379.10]  384-bit bus.
[380.82 --> 382.06]  Three slot card.
[382.18 --> 382.30]  Yeah.
[383.14 --> 387.40]  450 watts with a required system power of 850 watts.
[387.50 --> 388.34]  That seems optimistic.
[388.56 --> 389.46]  I guess we'll see how that goes.
[391.76 --> 394.24]  Why wouldn't you want to give me $1,600 for it?
[395.14 --> 398.28]  Well, the power cable and power supply situation is a little sketchy.
[398.38 --> 398.70]  Okay.
[399.28 --> 402.50]  But realistically, you've got $1,600 to just buy another power supply.
[402.56 --> 405.26]  You just hot swap everything, even if it melts after two hours of gaming?
[405.56 --> 405.82]  Yeah.
[405.92 --> 406.04]  Yeah.
[406.14 --> 407.34]  I mean, it's not going to melt.
[407.44 --> 407.94]  Come on, gamer.
[408.02 --> 408.58]  Be realistic.
[409.06 --> 410.00]  Didn't that actually happen?
[410.86 --> 411.46]  Oh, I don't know.
[411.54 --> 411.70]  Maybe.
[411.90 --> 416.10]  I was skimming through a Jay's Two Cents video earlier today, and he was talking about
[416.10 --> 421.66]  how the cable that you need is rated for 30 plug cycles.
[422.04 --> 422.28]  Mm.
[423.24 --> 423.68]  30.
[424.24 --> 425.06]  Like 3-0.
[425.06 --> 425.42]  Yeah.
[427.42 --> 428.06]  But like...
[428.06 --> 429.52]  And like he noticed changes.
[429.62 --> 433.02]  He was sitting there doing it, and he noticed it like start to feel different just while
[433.02 --> 435.22]  he was sitting there doing it like five or 10 times.
[435.72 --> 441.20]  And he said that bending the cable like everyone does when they're cable managing their cable
[441.20 --> 444.96]  will like significantly reduce the life cycle of it.
[444.96 --> 447.96]  Um, just...
[447.96 --> 449.30]  Yeah.
[449.92 --> 450.72]  Also money.
[450.92 --> 451.76]  You've got $1,600.
[452.24 --> 454.22]  So when it wears out, why don't you just buy another one?
[454.92 --> 455.36]  Yeah.
[455.82 --> 456.26]  Yeah.
[456.58 --> 462.14]  I think it would be extremely hard to convince me right now, if I was a buying consumer of
[462.14 --> 469.40]  graphics cards, to buy one of those unless I just hated money compared to what's happening
[469.40 --> 470.68]  to the used market right now.
[470.68 --> 471.20]  Okay.
[471.34 --> 472.90]  But you still haven't answered my question.
[473.04 --> 473.56]  I mean, why not?
[473.62 --> 475.48]  Why not just buy a 4090?
[475.60 --> 475.90]  Money.
[476.30 --> 478.72]  I mean, we'll just go earn more.
[479.06 --> 479.46]  Ah.
[479.52 --> 479.94]  What's the matter?
[480.02 --> 480.72]  Do you not have money?
[481.00 --> 481.34]  No.
[481.82 --> 482.04]  Okay.
[482.10 --> 483.78]  Because like I have lots of money.
[484.12 --> 485.64]  So why don't you have lots of money?
[485.76 --> 487.04]  We should...
[487.04 --> 489.86]  You should look into an incubator program.
[490.14 --> 491.16]  An incubator program.
[491.20 --> 491.32]  Yeah.
[491.32 --> 493.54]  So just to be clear, guys, we're role playing.
[493.74 --> 497.18]  I'm NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and Luke is a gamer.
[497.40 --> 497.58]  Yeah.
[498.10 --> 499.82]  I should look into an incubator program, right?
[499.86 --> 502.34]  But I'm not the one who needs to figure out how to make more money.
[502.50 --> 502.66]  Yeah.
[502.74 --> 502.86]  Yeah.
[502.86 --> 502.98]  Yeah.
[502.98 --> 503.20]  Exactly.
[503.20 --> 504.40]  You're the one who needs to make more money.
[504.76 --> 504.88]  Yeah.
[504.88 --> 504.96]  Yeah.
[505.02 --> 507.28]  So you should start an incubator program for other people.
[507.46 --> 508.34]  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[508.42 --> 508.60]  Okay.
[508.86 --> 509.36]  You should shut up.
[509.60 --> 510.58]  None of that is my problem.
[510.88 --> 511.04]  Yeah.
[511.04 --> 512.64]  I have 4090s to sell.
[512.78 --> 513.00]  Yeah.
[513.20 --> 513.50]  Okay.
[513.70 --> 513.90]  Yeah.
[513.98 --> 514.10]  Yeah.
[514.10 --> 516.16]  I've booked all this allocation with TSMC.
[516.16 --> 517.32]  Well, you screwed over EVGA.
[517.68 --> 518.06]  No, no, no.
[518.06 --> 519.44]  See, I don't want to talk about any of that.
[519.46 --> 522.46]  There's some question marks about who you're going to sell them through.
[522.46 --> 524.20]  No, I've got these 4090s to sell.
[524.52 --> 524.86]  Okay.
[525.20 --> 527.52]  I need $1,600 for them.
[528.66 --> 529.82]  So you got to do your part.
[529.98 --> 530.70]  I did my part.
[530.80 --> 531.70]  I built the 4090.
[532.00 --> 532.84]  I got to get another job.
[532.88 --> 533.00]  Yeah.
[533.10 --> 535.96]  So I feel like that's the least that you could do.
[539.86 --> 541.12]  The least that you could do.
[541.36 --> 543.32]  What a fantastic way to send it off.
[544.56 --> 544.92]  Okay.
[545.04 --> 546.40]  So in all seriousness.
[546.68 --> 547.38]  People are going to buy them.
[548.20 --> 549.98]  What's the rationale here, though?
[550.38 --> 561.14]  Like, was the design of these cards done during, you know, pandemic era pricing when they didn't think that, when they thought they could just spend, spend, spend?
[561.22 --> 563.00]  Is it a super expensive board?
[563.12 --> 564.48]  What's the justification here?
[564.54 --> 564.88]  Help me.
[564.88 --> 571.86]  They may have commit to certain things during pandemic era stuff, but most of these designs happen way further out than that.
[572.26 --> 572.36]  Right?
[572.36 --> 573.90]  Oh, man.
[574.00 --> 577.78]  You can be finalizing the board design in the months leading up to launch.
[577.78 --> 582.82]  Like, there could have been some changes, but I think the, like, the main goal would have already been established.
[582.82 --> 597.16]  He does say that chip prices going down is a, quote unquote, story of the past as wafer costs have increased and Moore's Law dies, which I think is extremely convenient if you are a big fan of leather jackets and excessively expensive kitchens.
[597.16 --> 597.40]  Yeah.
[597.40 --> 597.44]  Yeah.
[597.44 --> 603.34]  And the other issue with that is that we kind of experienced that with the 30 series, right?
[603.48 --> 609.46]  Where they went way up in price as the chip shortage went on.
[609.52 --> 610.12]  Chip got real big.
[610.12 --> 611.88]  And you know what?
[612.26 --> 619.54]  It's not like we didn't see news of chip fabs like TSMC saying, hey, yeah, pricing is going up.
[619.68 --> 624.08]  That did happen, and it's not like that has unhappened necessarily.
[624.08 --> 624.36]  Yeah.
[624.36 --> 633.74]  But the issue is that the actual, like, sand, the actual GPU itself is a fraction of the total cost of the board.
[633.94 --> 645.76]  So even if it went up 25% or even if it went up by double, that doesn't necessarily mean that a top tier GPU should cost this much more than it did last time around.
[645.76 --> 666.94]  And honestly, for the alleged, obviously, we haven't tested it yet, but for the announced performance of the RTX 4090, it's not that far off as long as you accept the premise that the performance per dollar isn't going to change.
[667.42 --> 667.52]  Right.
[667.52 --> 674.00]  If it is that much faster than a 3090 Ti, okay, fair enough.
[674.14 --> 675.58]  I guess it's not that outlandish.
[675.58 --> 693.98]  Where we really start to run into trouble is as we make our way down to the 4080 and the 4080 12 gig, which is, as far as I can tell, not a 4080 or even necessarily a 70 class card at all.
[693.98 --> 701.32]  And I remember us talking about this back when NVIDIA launched, I think the first time they pulled this move was with the 680.
[701.32 --> 706.40]  So you guys will have to go way, way, way, way back in time with us.
[706.76 --> 708.88]  What was the codename of that GPU?
[709.48 --> 713.36]  GTX 680 GPU codename.
[713.44 --> 714.80]  So that would have been Maxwell.
[715.08 --> 715.78]  Was that Maxwell?
[716.64 --> 717.50]  I can't even remember.
[717.50 --> 717.88]  Kepler.
[718.10 --> 718.34]  Okay.
[718.34 --> 722.70]  So that GPU was called GK104.
[723.46 --> 730.24]  And typically, the way that NVIDIA names their dies is that you've got G is for GeForce.
[730.66 --> 735.10]  The next letter is for the generation, for the architecture.
[735.36 --> 737.04]  So it's GK for Kepler.
[737.78 --> 741.04]  And then you'll have to forgive me.
[741.08 --> 743.88]  I'm actually not sure exactly what the 10 is.
[743.92 --> 745.18]  Is that because it's 10 series?
[745.26 --> 745.64]  Can't remember.
[745.70 --> 747.34]  That might be the generation or something like that.
[747.34 --> 751.18]  Anyway, the number I'm really focused on is the last one, the 4.
[751.54 --> 758.50]  And the way that NVIDIA determines that last number is the lower the number, the bigger the die.
[758.94 --> 761.12]  So a GK100.
[763.26 --> 765.56]  I can't remember if they had a GK100.
[766.20 --> 767.52]  So again, you'll have to forgive me.
[767.56 --> 770.02]  It might have been like GK102 or something like that.
[772.06 --> 772.96]  They had a 110.
[773.26 --> 773.72]  There we go.
[773.72 --> 776.16]  So 110 would have been the...
[776.16 --> 776.82]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[776.84 --> 777.94]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[778.00 --> 778.64]  You'll have to forgive me.
[778.72 --> 779.54]  Where are all the die names?
[779.88 --> 780.66]  Give me the die names.
[780.74 --> 781.26]  I need a thing.
[781.88 --> 782.40]  Here we go.
[783.38 --> 783.90]  GK...
[783.90 --> 785.30]  Hmm.
[786.02 --> 788.76]  GK104 is as low as it went for that one?
[789.06 --> 790.26]  That doesn't sound right.
[791.92 --> 792.56]  GTX6.
[792.56 --> 794.86]  Because what was the 780?
[797.16 --> 799.64]  780, code name die.
[799.98 --> 800.78]  Hold on, come on, come on.
[800.80 --> 803.76]  I think 104 was the lowest and then they just like stretched it.
[804.52 --> 805.22]  Is that right?
[805.28 --> 806.00]  Because I thought that...
[807.00 --> 809.30]  No, no, GK110 was the big one.
[809.70 --> 810.06]  Okay.
[810.18 --> 814.36]  And I think the second number was because it was like a mid refresh.
[814.36 --> 821.94]  So anyway, the point is that GK104, okay, so when they launched the 680, it was a much,
[822.04 --> 825.22]  much smaller die compared to the preceding 580.
[825.44 --> 831.80]  And the die size itself was more in line with what you'd expect from a 5...
[831.80 --> 832.62]  It was either...
[832.62 --> 836.02]  I think it was a 560, like, class product.
[836.02 --> 843.50]  Um, and so what that meant, essentially, was that NVIDIA had, I mean, to their credit,
[843.74 --> 849.26]  done such a good job of optimizing the Kepler architecture compared to the preceding Fermi
[849.26 --> 855.50]  architecture that they could get away with competing with AMD's top tier product with
[855.50 --> 856.70]  a mid-range product.
[856.86 --> 862.72]  So that was, to my knowledge, the first time they took what would ultimately end up being
[862.72 --> 870.40]  the second down tier die design, the smaller die, and got away with branding it as an 80
[870.40 --> 871.52]  class product.
[871.98 --> 878.20]  Then, when they released the, uh, the 700 series, which was also Kepler, so that was Kepler again,
[878.34 --> 884.12]  rather than an actual architectural change, we got to see big Kepler, and that was the,
[884.22 --> 886.46]  the big, the big dog, GK110.
[887.34 --> 889.96]  Um, so that's where you've got that zero at the end.
[889.96 --> 896.52]  Um, it looks like the numbers are not always that straightforward, so, uh, G...
[896.52 --> 897.74]  Oh, oh my goodness, okay.
[897.84 --> 900.26]  I'm not, no, I'm not even gonna, I'm not even gonna dig into any of this.
[900.48 --> 905.84]  So there was a 208, if I recall correctly, that was, like, when they did the, um, I don't
[905.84 --> 906.92]  know, there was another thing, it doesn't matter.
[907.24 --> 910.84]  The point is, the lower these numbers, typically, the bigger the die.
[910.94 --> 916.38]  So what we can see here is that when we look at the die code names for the 4000 series,
[916.38 --> 925.74]  and when we look at the, um, the memory bus width, not only is the 40, is the 80 class
[925.74 --> 935.36]  getting a step-down design with only a 256-bit bus, but the 480 12 gig is actually getting
[935.36 --> 939.36]  a wimpy 192-bit bus.
[940.22 --> 948.66]  Um, so what that seems to suggest is that NVIDIA, aside from not using, like, a 70, 80 class die
[948.66 --> 955.74]  for this supposedly 80 class product, is actually using, like, a 60 product class die.
[956.40 --> 960.46]  Um, so we're getting, like, a much, much, much smaller die.
[960.46 --> 966.20]  And so the reason that I'm so focused on die size is that that tends to be, generation
[966.20 --> 970.70]  by generation, what determines the relative cost.
[970.94 --> 972.54]  Because that's what you're paying for.
[972.64 --> 975.54]  So you got your wafer, which is about, like, yay big.
[975.88 --> 981.86]  And then the cost per wafer is some cost with all the processes that you have to apply to
[981.86 --> 983.94]  it in order to turn it into finished chips.
[983.94 --> 990.74]  Then you slice it up at the end, and whichever, whichever individual chips do not have egregious
[990.74 --> 993.70]  problems with them turn into finished products, right?
[993.80 --> 999.14]  So if you, if there is a problem on the wafer, uh, wherever the problem is, whatever die that
[999.14 --> 1001.16]  problem sits within is, is ruined.
[1001.30 --> 1005.46]  And so your yields are going to be, I mean, almost nobody actually discusses yields, but
[1005.46 --> 1008.52]  they'll be somewhere between zero and a hundred percent.
[1008.52 --> 1011.78]  And they'll never be a hundred percent because good luck with that.
[1011.78 --> 1015.28]  And they'll never be zero because that wouldn't be a viable product because you wouldn't be
[1015.28 --> 1016.74]  able to actually make any of them.
[1017.34 --> 1026.10]  So within that wafer, which has some cost, you can either slice it up into a few big chips,
[1026.26 --> 1030.52]  which also increases the chances of each of those having some kind of error or problem,
[1030.52 --> 1034.14]  or you can slice it up into many small chips.
[1034.18 --> 1036.54]  And those are your more budget oriented products.
[1036.80 --> 1037.94]  And if there's errors, they're more contained.
[1037.94 --> 1038.22]  Yeah.
[1038.30 --> 1042.10]  And so you are going to see wafer costs continue to rise.
[1042.44 --> 1049.26]  But even then, what we've seen so far is that that increase in wafer cost has not necessarily
[1049.26 --> 1055.42]  resulted in a, in a, in an increase of 50% or a, or a doubling a generation over generation
[1055.42 --> 1056.64]  of cost.
[1056.64 --> 1061.56]  And you need only look as far as like Intel's, you know, whatever their, whatever their, their
[1061.56 --> 1064.54]  top tier consumer chip is year after year after year.
[1064.54 --> 1072.10]  These die sizes have not gotten much, much smaller and their prices have not gotten much,
[1072.22 --> 1072.66]  much higher.
[1072.76 --> 1077.98]  They've tended to go up by, you know, five to 10% generation by generation, not in the
[1077.98 --> 1081.70]  same kinds of leaps that Nvidia seems to be targeting here.
[1081.70 --> 1095.22]  Um, so I think that aside from just being mad about it though, what can we do is the question.
[1098.62 --> 1099.02]  Nothing.
[1099.64 --> 1100.84]  Well, there's a couple of things.
[1100.84 --> 1101.74]  You can not buy it.
[1102.42 --> 1102.82]  Okay.
[1102.82 --> 1103.24]  That's one.
[1103.84 --> 1107.02]  Um, and we've seen based on what's happened with 30 series.
[1107.14 --> 1107.38]  Oh yeah.
[1107.38 --> 1107.62]  Right.
[1107.62 --> 1109.82]  So it comes back to the whole thing that happened with 30 series.
[1110.24 --> 1117.38]  Clearly what drove the increase in price was demand, not the cost of building it.
[1117.56 --> 1120.00]  I think we can all see that very clearly now.
[1120.62 --> 1127.10]  Um, and I want people to make sure that they don't forget that while, uh, retailer pricing
[1127.10 --> 1129.00]  and scalper pricing was going up.
[1129.40 --> 1131.40]  MSRP was also going up behind it.
[1131.56 --> 1131.76]  Yep.
[1131.76 --> 1138.38]  So these like, oh, compared to previous MSRP, it's like, yeah, compared to which one, because
[1138.38 --> 1140.34]  this product had MSR creep over time.
[1140.58 --> 1141.00]  Yes.
[1141.12 --> 1146.62]  So I'm comparing to the launch MSRP of the 30 series, which Nvidia clearly felt was sustainable.
[1147.40 --> 1154.44]  TSMC did hike wafer rates during the, the silicon shortage, which was real and is still
[1154.44 --> 1154.82]  real.
[1154.98 --> 1158.10]  There are still industries that are affected by chip shortages.
[1158.10 --> 1163.64]  There's still like, uh, massive, massive, massive amounts of trucks and other vehicles
[1163.64 --> 1164.54]  just sitting in lots.
[1164.72 --> 1165.04]  Absolutely.
[1165.42 --> 1169.84]  It's just that high end GPUs is not one of those industries at the moment.
[1170.12 --> 1170.20]  Yeah.
[1170.48 --> 1178.08]  So what I'm, so the reason I'm comparing to the 30 series at MSRP is because I think that's
[1178.08 --> 1181.94]  a very reasonable way for us to look at this because 30 series at launch was clearly going
[1181.94 --> 1182.56]  to be sustainable.
[1182.76 --> 1190.08]  And while prices have clearly risen, Nvidia can clearly sell them at their original MSRP,
[1190.28 --> 1191.46]  which is what they're doing now.
[1192.24 --> 1195.98]  Um, I doubt they're taking a loss on them.
[1196.22 --> 1201.18]  I suspect that they simply aren't making as much margin on them, but Nvidia is a public company.
[1201.18 --> 1205.74]  So we'll see soon enough if they actually had to write down this inventory or not.
[1205.74 --> 1214.34]  And I think that with enough pressure from either competition or from consumers that we
[1214.34 --> 1219.94]  will not have to put up with this for an entire generation, but, or I'd like to think that I,
[1219.94 --> 1221.02]  I suspect I'm going to end up wrong.
[1221.02 --> 1224.66]  We've seen time and time again that consumers have no spine and will buy anything that is
[1224.66 --> 1225.28]  offered to them.
[1225.40 --> 1228.60]  So I don't think that's actually going to put much pressure on it at all.
[1228.60 --> 1237.68]  The only thing that might put pressure there is if it is actually just bad because people
[1237.68 --> 1241.66]  will drop whatever, like, you're not, I don't think we're ever going to be able to pull everyone
[1241.66 --> 1243.94]  together and be like, don't buy it because pricing is bad.
[1243.94 --> 1245.18]  And we need to like hold out.
[1245.36 --> 1248.22]  We need to, you know, put a boycott on it.
[1248.36 --> 1250.14]  I don't think that'll function at all.
[1250.44 --> 1256.02]  Um, but if it's, if it's just not a good idea, if it's just a bad deal, whatever, maybe
[1256.02 --> 1263.10]  less people will buy it, but seeing how video cards go, uh, I think people are just going
[1263.10 --> 1264.10]  to rush out and do it anyways.
[1264.24 --> 1268.30]  Now AMD is announcing RDNA 3 GPUs November 3rd.
[1268.60 --> 1270.52]  And I have more hope now that I know the chiplet.
[1271.36 --> 1272.16]  Yes, me too.
[1272.20 --> 1272.56]  Actually.
[1272.64 --> 1273.66]  That's actually really cool.
[1273.66 --> 1277.74]  Um, I had very little hope before I heard that.
[1278.04 --> 1278.36]  I know.
[1278.54 --> 1282.42]  AMD GPUs have just been like a meme for so long.
[1282.42 --> 1282.78]  Long time.
[1283.04 --> 1283.18]  Yeah.
[1283.34 --> 1284.02]  Really long time.
[1284.02 --> 1288.58]  Um, it's been, it's been hard to recognize the GPU side of the business as the same company
[1288.58 --> 1293.56]  that's been absolutely like slaying the giant on the CPU side.
[1293.56 --> 1294.34]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[1294.76 --> 1301.82]  Um, but now that I know RDNA 3 is a chiplet design, which is exactly what has caused such
[1301.82 --> 1303.56]  a thorn in Intel side.
[1305.32 --> 1307.64]  I can't help, but be kind of excited.
[1307.64 --> 1316.20]  I mean, Apple has, has kind of shown us, has shown us that a multi, multi component GPU
[1316.20 --> 1318.34]  with a high speed interconnect can work.
[1318.38 --> 1318.86]  Yeah.
[1319.04 --> 1320.62]  I mean, uh, what, what is it?
[1320.64 --> 1325.70]  Which I can't, I can't, I hate their naming scheme so much, but it would be the M1 Pro Max
[1325.70 --> 1328.84]  or whatever, whatever the, whatever the top tier ultra.
[1328.84 --> 1337.16]  I don't know, whatever the top tier M1 chip is, has essentially two kind of separated GPU
[1337.16 --> 1340.12]  die areas with an interconnect between them.
[1340.20 --> 1343.64]  That's, that's to my knowledge, never been done before.
[1344.20 --> 1349.40]  Uh, because of all the, I mean, it's the same issue that caused micro stuttering in SLI because
[1349.40 --> 1355.64]  those GPUs need to have such high speed links between them in order to, uh, in order to share
[1355.64 --> 1361.54]  data in such a way that they can, uh, that they can operate without micro stutter that it just
[1361.54 --> 1363.58]  wasn't, it just hasn't been feasible.
[1364.02 --> 1365.20]  But Apple did it.
[1365.78 --> 1369.34]  AMD has a chiplet design that clearly they're confident enough in to release.
[1369.78 --> 1373.36]  And RDNA 3 looks pretty good from what we've seen of it so far.
[1373.70 --> 1376.70]  So I'm, I'm excited.
[1376.70 --> 1381.34]  Uh, grave PCMR on Twitch says people need to stop bashing AMD GPUs.
[1381.40 --> 1383.98]  They are great and a better value than Nvidia GPUs.
[1384.02 --> 1385.40]  Linus, you're hopelessly biased.
[1391.00 --> 1391.54]  Hold on.
[1391.56 --> 1393.60]  Let me come back with some great AMD GPUs.
[1393.64 --> 1394.22]  One moment, please.
[1394.38 --> 1394.62]  Okay.
[1394.68 --> 1394.88]  Okay.
[1394.94 --> 1395.18]  Okay.
[1395.76 --> 1397.04]  There are some, they exist.
[1397.50 --> 1398.24]  They exist.
[1398.56 --> 1400.46]  I expect it's not actually a joke.
[1400.46 --> 1402.78]  I suspect he might actually bring one back.
[1403.20 --> 1406.28]  Um, it's probably going to be really old.
[1406.70 --> 1412.14]  Because we do have like an area of the storage, which is actually quite close to us, which is
[1412.14 --> 1414.18]  like really old school GPUs.
[1414.22 --> 1417.50]  And he's going to have to go back into the vault to pull one of these out.
[1417.66 --> 1419.26]  He might have to dust it off a little bit.
[1419.82 --> 1420.90]  I hope we have a brush.
[1421.56 --> 1426.54]  Um, but you know, 290 and 290X.
[1426.66 --> 1427.84]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1427.94 --> 1428.92]  Featured in Scrapyard Wars.
[1428.98 --> 1429.76]  Maybe those will come up.
[1429.82 --> 1430.12]  We'll see.
[1430.74 --> 1432.24]  Um, other things to talk about.
[1432.24 --> 1434.70]  I think he's going to want to be here for pretty much everything.
[1435.28 --> 1439.48]  Um, and I don't think I have enough time to talk about video game Dunkey and his big
[1439.48 --> 1440.26]  mode publisher.
[1440.64 --> 1442.30]  Uh, but we'll talk about that later.
[1442.40 --> 1443.14]  Do you want a question, Luke?
[1443.14 --> 1443.72]  I have one for you.
[1443.84 --> 1444.04]  Sure.
[1444.06 --> 1444.50]  Let's do it.
[1444.62 --> 1446.86]  Last week you shared that you are scuba certified.
[1446.98 --> 1447.16]  Yeah.
[1447.24 --> 1449.46]  Have you been anywhere cool or have plans to go anywhere cool?
[1449.56 --> 1450.08]  That's from Anon.
[1450.30 --> 1450.62]  Sure.
[1450.62 --> 1453.52]  Um, I've been to a few places.
[1453.62 --> 1459.08]  My favorite one was, uh, Green Island in Taiwan, which it's going to have a different name
[1459.08 --> 1463.44]  if you can speak, uh, Taiwanese, I guess, but I know it as Green Island.
[1463.70 --> 1465.72]  The diving there was absolutely fantastic.
[1465.72 --> 1466.70]  Really, really awesome.
[1466.78 --> 1470.00]  There's one place, uh, we went, I don't remember how deep it was.
[1470.04 --> 1470.38]  I'm sorry.
[1470.42 --> 1472.84]  It's been, it's been a few years because we haven't been able to travel.
[1473.40 --> 1479.58]  Um, but I used to go to Taiwan every year, but yeah, the dive brought us through two opposing
[1479.58 --> 1480.02]  currents.
[1480.18 --> 1483.34]  So as we were going down, there's one current that went this way and then there's another
[1483.34 --> 1484.64]  current that this went this way.
[1484.70 --> 1489.06]  And then there was a valley between two like underwater mountain things and there was reef
[1489.06 --> 1490.12]  everywhere and tons of fish.
[1490.14 --> 1491.64]  And it was, it was absolutely beautiful.
[1491.76 --> 1492.06]  Loved it.
[1492.22 --> 1492.78]  All right.
[1492.92 --> 1493.96]  Oh, I, yeah.
[1494.50 --> 1494.80]  Okay.
[1494.96 --> 1495.24]  Okay.
[1495.86 --> 1496.66]  No one saw those.
[1496.66 --> 1498.86]  Cause those all went to, went to mining.
[1498.86 --> 1500.34]  Let us not forget.
[1500.68 --> 1507.86]  Let us not forget the truly amazing best-selling product that was, oh man.
[1507.86 --> 1515.42]  Um, the, uh, Radeon Vega 64 water-cooled edition.
[1515.74 --> 1517.68]  It wasn't even vaporware at all.
[1518.00 --> 1518.50]  Yeah.
[1518.50 --> 1520.80]  This product definitely actually existed.
[1520.80 --> 1528.54]  I remember, I remember a whole thing where I was like, I was like, yeah, you know, we've
[1528.54 --> 1531.04]  been using a lot of like NVIDIA GPUs in our builds lately.
[1531.30 --> 1535.24]  And I, I went on Newegg, like, like mid life cycle for this product.
[1535.36 --> 1538.40]  And I was like, oh yeah, like what's their, what's their like pricing like?
[1538.40 --> 1541.40]  Has it settled in a little bit since launch when it wasn't competitive at all?
[1541.40 --> 1548.02]  And there was literally one vendor that had like one SKU for, for Vega 64.
[1548.66 --> 1553.62]  And, uh, of that SKU, you know how you can just like key in the quantity that you want
[1553.62 --> 1555.36]  to buy and it'll correct you if they don't have enough.
[1555.44 --> 1558.54]  They had like three in stock and this was on Newegg.com.
[1559.50 --> 1562.22]  Functionally, these things didn't exist.
[1562.50 --> 1565.22]  Uh, big, big F, big fail.
[1565.22 --> 1569.04]  Didn't Vega 64 non-water cooling exist, but they like all went to miners?
[1569.22 --> 1570.10]  That was my understanding.
[1570.10 --> 1572.64]  Uh, Vega 56 kind of existed.
[1572.98 --> 1573.10]  Oh, okay.
[1573.18 --> 1577.02]  But even for that one, you know, you'd go on Newegg.com and they'd have literally like
[1577.02 --> 1578.10]  25 in stock.
[1578.32 --> 1586.20]  And on any G4 SKU, individual SKU, they would have more than that in stock to give you some
[1586.20 --> 1587.74]  idea of what the sales disparity was.
[1587.80 --> 1589.58]  Guys, I'm, I don't make the rules here.
[1589.94 --> 1591.68]  I'm, I'm just informing you.
[1592.22 --> 1598.88]  Um, and let it, and let us not forget, let us not forget the Radeon 7.
[1600.10 --> 1604.80]  I think, I think they actually did make seven of them.
[1606.48 --> 1608.56]  I was going to say, I don't even know if I've seen this.
[1608.56 --> 1615.56]  Uh, this was a product that as far as anyone could tell was a data center GPU that they
[1615.56 --> 1624.50]  like, I don't know, had some extras of or something and they did one run of them and then it just
[1624.50 --> 1627.24]  quietly freaking disappeared.
[1627.80 --> 1629.34]  Like, okay.
[1629.34 --> 1632.80]  Are we ever going to, are we ever going to talk about Radeon 7 again?
[1635.50 --> 1636.48]  Oh boy.
[1636.76 --> 1637.24]  All right.
[1637.58 --> 1638.38]  No problem.
[1639.26 --> 1641.62]  Guys, look, I don't, I don't make this stuff up.
[1641.68 --> 1644.12]  This is just, it's just a reality.
[1644.12 --> 1644.82]  I'm sorry.
[1645.12 --> 1646.04]  I'm sorry.
[1646.54 --> 1650.76]  Um, it's, it, it, no, I, I'm not, I'm not a fan boy.
[1650.84 --> 1652.76]  I'm just, I've just been doing this a long time.
[1652.80 --> 1653.58]  I'm just jaded.
[1653.74 --> 1655.04]  I'm jaded and cynical.
[1655.46 --> 1657.08]  R9 280 really solid?
[1657.42 --> 1659.16]  Uh, nine years ago.
[1659.20 --> 1665.88]  The R9 280 was a re-release of a, of a GPU that they had already released like two years
[1665.88 --> 1666.32]  prior.
[1666.68 --> 1668.22]  Wasn't it pretty good price performance though?
[1668.54 --> 1669.36]  Well, yeah.
[1669.54 --> 1671.70]  Like, uh, you know, nine years ago.
[1671.82 --> 1672.02]  Yeah.
[1672.22 --> 1673.00]  I, was it nine?
[1673.08 --> 1674.08]  I think it was nine years ago.
[1674.22 --> 1675.92]  I know I just said that twice, but I think so.
[1675.92 --> 1681.98]  Well, the R9 280 was announced at the Hawaii launch where the only, if I recall correctly,
[1681.98 --> 1685.96]  the only actual new card was the 90 class cards.
[1686.16 --> 1690.06]  And then the 80 was just a rebranded 79 70, if I recall.
[1690.74 --> 1693.34]  And then didn't they rebrand it again as the 380?
[1693.58 --> 1694.18]  It's been so long.
[1694.26 --> 1695.48]  I don't really remember any of this.
[1695.58 --> 1700.08]  I just remember the price performance was pretty solid and people would sell them used for like
[1700.08 --> 1700.92]  nothing.
[1701.20 --> 1704.32]  Guy in Matt Sy asks, did those Fury GPUs exist?
[1704.66 --> 1709.46]  That was yet another essentially vaporware AMD high-end GPU.
[1709.46 --> 1714.54]  They've released these high-end products that have been not competitive.
[1715.08 --> 1717.90]  And then because they're not competitive, nobody's actually buying them.
[1718.08 --> 1721.74]  Like you got the weird, like all team red fanboy builds.
[1722.22 --> 1722.30]  Yeah.
[1722.42 --> 1723.80]  And that's it.
[1723.94 --> 1728.10]  And so you can't get board partner support for them because when you do a run of boards,
[1728.10 --> 1733.80]  like you're talking thousands, tens of thousands, not like a few hundred.
[1733.80 --> 1736.78]  You do not build a few hundred graphics cards.
[1736.78 --> 1737.54]  It's not a thing.
[1738.20 --> 1744.18]  So it just, why, and why would you, why would you go and buy thousands of something that
[1744.18 --> 1747.80]  you know is obsolete before you even build it other than to just do a favor for AMD?
[1748.50 --> 1749.84]  Um, there are exceptions.
[1749.96 --> 1750.06]  Yeah.
[1750.12 --> 1751.26]  5,700 XT.
[1751.36 --> 1751.50]  Yeah.
[1751.54 --> 1752.20]  Strong card.
[1752.60 --> 1753.04]  Polaris.
[1753.26 --> 1753.40]  Yeah.
[1753.50 --> 1754.60]  Polaris was solid.
[1755.20 --> 1757.82]  Uh, it's so funny to hear people talking about RX 580.
[1757.92 --> 1760.44]  RX 580 is RX 570 or 480.
[1760.44 --> 1761.02]  Excuse me.
[1761.52 --> 1765.64]  Um, 470 is 480 and, uh, 570.
[1767.12 --> 1770.74]  470 is 570 and 480 is 580.
[1770.84 --> 1772.16]  They're, they're essentially the same thing.
[1772.16 --> 1773.86]  It's like, it's like a firmware update.
[1774.34 --> 1779.80]  Uh, some can says a 7970 mind me 15 bitcoins 10 years ago.
[1779.98 --> 1784.02]  So, Hey, Hey, did you trade those for a pizza or did you actually hold on to them?
[1784.08 --> 1787.50]  Uh, Linus is just focusing on the high end, which they've not done much with in the last
[1787.50 --> 1788.02]  few years.
[1788.02 --> 1788.78]  Yeah.
[1788.78 --> 1791.70]  Cause they couldn't, you don't think they wanted to.
[1793.20 --> 1795.38]  Everyone likes selling high end GPUs.
[1795.42 --> 1796.14]  It's a good time.
[1796.28 --> 1802.64]  I think the main ones that we've been talking about today have been, uh, 480, sorry, 40,
[1802.72 --> 1805.86]  80, 40, 70, 40, 90.
[1806.42 --> 1807.90]  So we're talking about high end cards.
[1808.26 --> 1809.90]  Yeah, of course we're talking about high end cards.
[1810.54 --> 1816.02]  Um, but yeah, so I, I forget why I was talking about AMD.
[1816.02 --> 1816.56]  Oh yeah.
[1816.56 --> 1816.82]  Right.
[1816.88 --> 1819.24]  Because I'm actually hopeful for RD and a three.
[1819.38 --> 1820.24]  I'm excited.
[1820.56 --> 1825.84]  Uh, it seems like over the last couple of years, they've really settled down in terms of their
[1825.84 --> 1826.62]  driver development.
[1827.30 --> 1829.50]  Uh, I still, I really need to try it.
[1829.54 --> 1834.18]  I haven't tried it yet, but apparently their hardware encoding has gotten a lot better,
[1834.26 --> 1835.70]  which is a big one for me.
[1835.70 --> 1839.84]  Like AMD and Nvidia, AMD could be 10% better price to performance than Nvidia.
[1840.34 --> 1845.32]  And if they don't have good hardware, H264 encoding, or I mean, failing that AV1, it's
[1845.32 --> 1845.60]  fine.
[1845.64 --> 1847.58]  Well, until OBS supports AV1, I guess I don't care.
[1847.70 --> 1852.62]  But until they have solid hardware encoding, I'm just, I, I'm not going to do it because
[1852.62 --> 1856.38]  on the occasion that I do stream, I'm not going to want to suck up CPU cycles.
[1857.34 --> 1861.54]  Um, but if they have it, man, like.
[1862.14 --> 1862.78]  What do you stream?
[1862.90 --> 1864.38]  I'm excited for a viable alternative.
[1864.68 --> 1865.28]  What do you stream?
[1865.28 --> 1866.18]  I stream Beat Saber.
[1866.62 --> 1866.78]  Yeah.
[1866.84 --> 1867.46]  Is that hard to stream?
[1868.22 --> 1868.90]  Beat Saber.
[1868.98 --> 1869.24]  Well, yeah.
[1869.28 --> 1871.28]  You don't want to suck up CPU cycles when you're in VR.
[1873.00 --> 1873.36]  Yeah.
[1873.62 --> 1874.92]  It matters more than you'd think.
[1874.94 --> 1876.46]  Cause if I get a stutter, I get sick.
[1877.02 --> 1877.66]  Fair enough.
[1877.92 --> 1878.12]  Okay.
[1878.26 --> 1878.70]  For real.
[1878.80 --> 1882.40]  And Anno is actually, can be actually pretty heavy once you're far into games.
[1882.54 --> 1883.18]  Yeah, exactly.
[1883.40 --> 1883.56]  Yeah.
[1883.84 --> 1884.72]  Um, all right.
[1884.78 --> 1885.78]  So the discussion around.
[1885.90 --> 1886.76]  OBS already supports AV1 encoding.
[1886.86 --> 1887.66]  I didn't actually know that.
[1888.24 --> 1888.48]  Sorry?
[1889.10 --> 1891.62]  Someone in chat said OBS already supports AV1 encoding.
[1891.66 --> 1891.94]  Really?
[1892.44 --> 1893.32]  Since OBS 28.
[1893.68 --> 1894.70]  Oh, well that's exciting.
[1894.70 --> 1895.98]  I didn't know that.
[1895.98 --> 1899.36]  But that leads us perfectly into our discussion question here.
[1899.52 --> 1900.62]  So the big winner.
[1901.12 --> 1902.70]  This is, it's in here as like a question.
[1902.80 --> 1903.34]  I added this.
[1903.94 --> 1905.26]  In my opinion, Intel.
[1905.88 --> 1909.50]  Because what it looks like is if we look at last gen games.
[1909.60 --> 1911.84]  Cause the, the two to four X faster.
[1911.84 --> 1916.26]  Well, that's for next gen games with like DLSS 3 and stuff.
[1916.38 --> 1917.96]  NVIDIA does this every single launch.
[1918.06 --> 1918.58]  Get used to it.
[1918.78 --> 1923.38]  So when they say last gen games, we're expecting only one and a half to 1.6 times faster, which
[1923.38 --> 1930.04]  means that your price per FPS looks like it's actually not really changing that much.
[1930.54 --> 1939.34]  Essentially, they're taking, they're doing the same thing they did with the, uh, the 20 series where they're taking the existing lineup and they're basically just going, yeah.
[1939.34 --> 1944.16]  However that performed, we're going to put these new cards higher.
[1944.56 --> 1944.96]  Exactly.
[1945.46 --> 1947.68]  Exactly in line with the pricing of the last generation.
[1947.82 --> 1952.68]  Instead of accounting for that, they like have actually gone down in cost for them for FPS per dollar.
[1952.78 --> 1953.40]  But don't worry about that.
[1953.46 --> 1953.98]  Don't worry about that.
[1953.98 --> 1965.96]  So if they do that, I think the big winner is Intel, because if they built a product that was supposed to compete FPS per dollar with 30 series, then it might still actually compete.
[1966.12 --> 1974.46]  It'll be, it'll be a lower end product than it would have been in terms of how far away it is from the top of the line in the market.
[1974.46 --> 1989.08]  But that doesn't mean that it won't be a totally valid and relevant product at the price that, you know, Luke, the gamer who doesn't want to get another job so he can buy a GPU can actually afford.
[1990.00 --> 1990.84]  Big winner.
[1991.16 --> 1991.38]  Yeah.
[1991.50 --> 1992.32]  Potentially Intel.
[1992.52 --> 1994.82]  I also like, I don't know.
[1995.10 --> 2004.22]  I often have cheaper tastes than a lot of people, but a 70 series or a 70, whatever, a 4070 starting at 900.
[2005.24 --> 2006.54]  Is a lot.
[2008.16 --> 2009.16]  A lot.
[2009.20 --> 2011.02]  That's a ton of money.
[2011.54 --> 2017.84]  Like, I know this is long, long, long time ago, but weren't we looking at like 400?
[2018.02 --> 2020.94]  Like it's over doubled in the last 10 years, right?
[2021.12 --> 2021.36]  Oh yeah.
[2021.80 --> 2022.06]  Yeah.
[2022.56 --> 2022.92]  Oh yeah.
[2022.96 --> 2023.56]  Huge portion.
[2023.56 --> 2024.54]  900 bucks.
[2024.86 --> 2034.44]  When you're looking at gaming builds now that are pretty solid for the majority of games that people play for like a mid range gamer that are around the world.
[2034.46 --> 2037.52]  Around the price of your graphics card.
[2038.38 --> 2042.12]  Like I, I helped, I helped a buddy spec out a computer recently.
[2042.26 --> 2043.54]  Didn't have a huge budget.
[2043.64 --> 2046.90]  We priced it in and I think about a thousand or 1100, something like that.
[2046.94 --> 2048.60]  Like it's always, it's an okay amount of money.
[2048.68 --> 2049.80]  It's not a massive budget though.
[2050.16 --> 2051.64]  It's going to do pretty good.
[2052.90 --> 2058.00]  It's pretty darn close to the price of the entire graphics card and that he's going to be completely fine.
[2058.06 --> 2058.86]  He already has the computer.
[2058.98 --> 2063.10]  He is completely fine in like almost everything people play.
[2064.20 --> 2064.96]  Like sure.
[2064.96 --> 2069.08]  He's not cranking Star Citizen, but there's like 40 people that play.
[2069.36 --> 2071.12]  So that's, that's actually not true.
[2071.26 --> 2074.20]  They passed 500, 500 million dollars in funding.
[2074.24 --> 2074.40]  Yeah.
[2074.40 --> 2075.18]  That's in the WANDOC.
[2075.30 --> 2075.76]  Is it really?
[2075.86 --> 2076.02]  Yeah.
[2076.06 --> 2076.76]  We'll talk about it.
[2076.86 --> 2077.04]  Yeah.
[2077.12 --> 2077.42]  Wow.
[2078.00 --> 2081.98]  The 8800 GTX, which came out in 2004.
[2083.94 --> 2086.08]  MSRP 599 US.
[2086.92 --> 2087.48]  8800.
[2087.48 --> 2089.38]  That was a sick card.
[2089.44 --> 2097.92]  That was the top tier until they released a mid cycle refresh 8800 Ultra that was just an overclocked 8800 GTX.
[2098.04 --> 2099.50]  It was, it was essentially the same thing.
[2099.84 --> 2101.30]  And so we can't really.
[2101.42 --> 2102.28]  That was a wicked time.
[2102.34 --> 2105.08]  We can't really compare this to a 4080.
[2105.56 --> 2110.64]  And the reason for that is that it's not an apples to apples die to die comparison.
[2110.64 --> 2117.00]  The 8800 GTX was a 384 bit memory bus, large die part.
[2117.48 --> 2123.90]  So really from like a die area standpoint, the equivalent would be the 4090.
[2124.34 --> 2124.58]  Yeah.
[2124.68 --> 2133.68]  Which is coming in at $1,600, which is somewhere about two and what does that work out to about two and a half X the price.
[2134.80 --> 2139.20]  Now, if we go and we play, let's play inflation calculator.
[2139.20 --> 2139.56]  All right.
[2139.56 --> 2141.40]  Because that's certainly been a thing.
[2142.10 --> 2144.24]  Inflation calculator USD.
[2144.46 --> 2144.62]  All right.
[2144.62 --> 2145.28]  Especially a lot lately.
[2145.52 --> 2145.82]  Come on.
[2145.88 --> 2147.18]  Come hang with me, you guys.
[2147.18 --> 2148.54]  Let's play with the USD inflator.
[2148.68 --> 2158.28]  So if in 2004, I purchased an item for $599, then in 2002, calculate $939.
[2159.08 --> 2161.52]  So it's entirely, oh, sorry, guys.
[2161.78 --> 2170.00]  It's entirely believable that you could pay $939 for a top tier GPU today.
[2170.28 --> 2171.40]  That wouldn't seem too surprising.
[2171.62 --> 2174.24]  No, that wouldn't be that surprising to me at all.
[2174.24 --> 2189.50]  So that's the actual price that they've come in with for the 47, excuse me, sorry, ah, the 4080 12 gig, which is, by the way, like a mainstream tier part in terms of die area.
[2189.50 --> 2196.64]  But there's one problem with that argument that Nvidia is making that, well, semiconductors, electronics are getting more expensive.
[2197.58 --> 2203.50]  And that's every other electronics thing.
[2203.50 --> 2206.34]  Electronics is like this magic.
[2206.96 --> 2210.56]  It like has inflationary armor or something.
[2210.96 --> 2216.54]  Like, look at what the cost of a TV is compared to what it was in 2004.
[2216.76 --> 2217.64]  It's actually crazy cheap.
[2217.72 --> 2218.46]  It's wild.
[2218.46 --> 2221.78]  And this is another thing.
[2222.22 --> 2229.40]  TVs, TV manufacturers are under a lot of the same pressures that silicon manufacturers are.
[2229.52 --> 2236.22]  Except there's more competition in their space compared to Mr. GPU team that has no one against them effectively right now.
[2236.64 --> 2237.16]  Exactly.
[2237.44 --> 2238.22]  That's the problem.
[2238.22 --> 2242.84]  As you try to build bigger and bigger TVs, the fabs get bigger and more complex.
[2243.06 --> 2250.10]  As you try to cram in more pixel density, you have to deal with far higher complexity, far lower yields.
[2250.44 --> 2250.68]  Failure rates.
[2250.90 --> 2255.62]  Consumer demands have gotten much, much more stringent.
[2255.90 --> 2259.84]  People used to accept that you could have up to five to seven dead pixels.
[2259.86 --> 2261.32]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2261.46 --> 2263.46]  Now, they'll just take it back.
[2263.64 --> 2264.36]  One dead pixel.
[2264.48 --> 2265.00]  No, you're done.
[2265.08 --> 2265.40]  You're done.
[2265.46 --> 2265.84]  You're out.
[2265.84 --> 2267.52]  You're out.
[2267.62 --> 2269.60]  And reliability has become much more of a challenge.
[2269.70 --> 2279.24]  I suspect that LG does more warranty replacement of their OLED TVs than they probably did of the previous technologies that they focused on just because of the nature of OLED.
[2279.62 --> 2287.94]  And if you run it at full brightness all the time with static imagery, it is going to wear out within the warranty period, which I don't think was a problem that they necessarily faced before.
[2288.32 --> 2288.36]  Yeah.
[2288.36 --> 2292.96]  So these other electronics industries are under a lot of the same pressures.
[2292.96 --> 2296.98]  And yet, it's a very different result.
[2299.50 --> 2299.90]  Yep.
[2300.56 --> 2303.88]  I'm very much hoping for other teams.
[2304.14 --> 2312.74]  I was already really hoping for Intel, and I know I'm saying this for like the fourth time this show, but the whole chiplet thing has me stoked for AMD's new offerings as well.
[2313.00 --> 2313.76]  We'll see how it goes.
[2313.76 --> 2322.84]  One of our other discussion questions, actually, before we wrap this up, and we will soon, but one of our other discussion questions is how much of this is NVIDIA strategy?
[2323.34 --> 2336.70]  How much of this is higher pricing so that they can just get rid of the rumored enormous stockpile of 30 series cards that they have sitting there because they overproduced for a mining boom that busted?
[2336.70 --> 2341.82]  So like making it not an improvement in price performance is strategic.
[2342.24 --> 2342.46]  Yeah.
[2342.74 --> 2345.08]  Because they actually do not want you to buy 40 series.
[2345.20 --> 2346.28]  Because sitting on inventory is expensive.
[2346.62 --> 2346.82]  Yeah.
[2346.88 --> 2355.00]  So this way, they don't have to mark down their 30 series as much unless AMD sees a moment of weakness.
[2355.38 --> 2355.96]  Drops something big.
[2356.04 --> 2358.28]  And decides to twist the knife.
[2358.28 --> 2358.74]  They've done it before.
[2359.84 --> 2360.90]  They've done it before.
[2361.06 --> 2361.92]  I'd like to see it.
[2362.22 --> 2362.82]  That'd be sweet.
[2362.82 --> 2363.94]  So here's my idea.
[2364.38 --> 2386.66]  I think that following just our, you know, vanilla review of the RTX 4000 or whatever, when that comes out, following that, I kind of want to do a deeper dive into RTX 4000 versus RTX 3000 plus ARK as a dedicated AV1 encoding coprocessor.
[2387.60 --> 2391.12]  And specifically, I would want to look at it from like a streaming standpoint.
[2391.12 --> 2391.30]  Yeah.
[2391.62 --> 2392.62]  I think you'd have to.
[2392.82 --> 2394.48]  I think that would be, that would be sick.
[2394.56 --> 2394.86]  That'd be sweet.
[2395.06 --> 2399.10]  I have always loved mixed team GPU setups.
[2399.32 --> 2405.76]  I remember way back in the day, you did some video in the house about running AMD and NVIDIA.
[2405.90 --> 2408.50]  I had SLI and Crossfire.
[2408.56 --> 2408.58]  Yeah.
[2408.72 --> 2408.90]  Yeah.
[2409.00 --> 2409.14]  Yeah.
[2409.14 --> 2409.22]  Yeah.
[2409.22 --> 2410.54]  In the same computer.
[2410.66 --> 2411.42]  Like that was cool.
[2411.52 --> 2412.80]  That was so stupid.
[2413.00 --> 2413.40]  Ridiculous.
[2413.54 --> 2415.76]  But it was cool that it like functioned.
[2415.80 --> 2416.18]  Yeah.
[2416.36 --> 2417.92]  It was, it was pretty dumb.
[2417.92 --> 2423.66]  So the idea was that depending on whether the game was better optimized for NVIDIA or for AMD,
[2424.20 --> 2430.10]  you could switch which primary GPU your monitor was plugged into.
[2431.10 --> 2433.16]  Get the best of all worlds.
[2433.16 --> 2439.02]  Oh, by the way, I hope your GPUs don't need to breathe because they're all a solid brick installed in your PCIe slots.
[2439.02 --> 2440.54]  I'm pretty sure we didn't water cool it.
[2440.70 --> 2441.84]  So very cool.
[2443.00 --> 2444.14]  But yeah, I don't know.
[2444.38 --> 2449.30]  Hopefully the GPU world gets turned on its head because it's been pretty frustrating for a while now.
[2449.30 --> 2453.72]  CPU was frustrating for a longer period of time and then got solved.
[2454.26 --> 2454.38]  Yeah.
[2454.56 --> 2455.88]  Maybe AMD can solve it again.
[2455.98 --> 2456.86]  I'd like to see it solved.
[2457.32 --> 2463.68]  We also need a solution to Logitech thinking that their G Cloud handheld has any reason for existing.
[2464.38 --> 2471.70]  You know, I heard through the grapevine that some kind of Logitech gaming handheld was coming quite some time ago.
[2471.70 --> 2480.78]  I was going to say it must have been quite some time ago because the planning for this must have started before they heard about Steam Deck.
[2481.38 --> 2482.50]  It must have.
[2482.70 --> 2483.44]  It has to.
[2483.44 --> 2489.54]  I did not know that it was going to be a cloud gaming device.
[2490.12 --> 2496.40]  Cloud, so that's the name of the product, which won't get confusing when you're trying to look up information about it at all.
[2497.06 --> 2500.84]  Cloud requires a cloud, but not capitalized.
[2500.84 --> 2504.32]  Subscription service sold separately to work as intended.
[2505.20 --> 2506.64]  Holy shit.
[2506.80 --> 2507.92]  Good luck, Logitech.
[2508.22 --> 2511.70]  Such as NVIDIA GeForce Now or Xbox Game Pass.
[2511.82 --> 2512.50]  The specs.
[2513.48 --> 2516.34]  Snapdragon 720G.
[2516.82 --> 2517.00]  Woo!
[2517.48 --> 2518.34]  So fast.
[2518.48 --> 2519.74]  So powerful.
[2519.94 --> 2520.42]  G-Wiz.
[2520.52 --> 2522.70]  This sure is a mainstream tier product.
[2523.14 --> 2524.58]  Octa-core CPU.
[2524.88 --> 2525.78]  1080p.
[2526.24 --> 2526.68]  Okay.
[2527.56 --> 2528.02]  IPS.
[2528.08 --> 2528.50]  IPS.
[2528.50 --> 2529.72]  450 nits.
[2529.98 --> 2530.36]  Okay.
[2530.36 --> 2531.34]  60 hertz.
[2531.54 --> 2532.76]  12 hours battery life.
[2532.84 --> 2533.62]  Oh my god.
[2533.72 --> 2535.62]  Who worked on this product page?
[2535.74 --> 2537.18]  This is the fresh rate.
[2538.02 --> 2539.12]  We so fresh.
[2539.48 --> 2540.74]  Wait, does it say fresh rate?
[2540.92 --> 2542.10]  It says fresh rate.
[2542.20 --> 2543.56]  That F is capitalized.
[2543.82 --> 2544.76]  It's not cut off.
[2544.84 --> 2545.76]  That's awesome.
[2545.92 --> 2547.02]  The fresh rate.
[2547.10 --> 2548.02]  That is so sick.
[2548.14 --> 2549.62]  60 hertz, yo!
[2550.42 --> 2551.30]  Fresh rate.
[2552.14 --> 2553.62]  You need another wrapping video.
[2553.66 --> 2555.00]  It's been too long.
[2555.04 --> 2555.74]  No, I do not.
[2555.84 --> 2556.72]  I do not need that.
[2556.72 --> 2558.46]  Stereo speaker.
[2559.36 --> 2559.70]  Okay.
[2560.40 --> 2561.50]  No, no.
[2561.84 --> 2565.12]  It's either a mono speaker or stereo speakers.
[2565.44 --> 2567.04]  You cannot have it both ways.
[2567.60 --> 2569.20]  Bluetooth 5.1.
[2569.84 --> 2572.14]  Digital USB-C headphone support.
[2574.14 --> 2575.40]  That's still analog.
[2576.68 --> 2579.90]  Man, I don't want to be that guy, but come on, you guys.
[2579.90 --> 2583.30]  It comes with a power adapter in the box.
[2583.42 --> 2584.24]  That's sick.
[2584.44 --> 2585.92]  Battery watt hours.
[2586.60 --> 2587.04]  Wait, what?
[2587.48 --> 2587.70]  Battery.
[2587.78 --> 2589.80]  Well, I mean, yes, that is the unit.
[2590.08 --> 2593.94]  But like the unit goes after here and you would just say battery capacity.
[2594.12 --> 2598.28]  You wouldn't say battery grams and then 90 grams.
[2598.84 --> 2599.04]  You would.
[2599.04 --> 2602.02]  Really, you guys?
[2604.14 --> 2609.56]  They also, I also enjoy that they say battery watt hours and then they put watt hours again,
[2609.66 --> 2610.82]  but abbreviated in the spec.
[2612.66 --> 2613.74]  Team Redundant Team.
[2614.56 --> 2615.00]  Yeah.
[2615.50 --> 2616.68]  There's reviews on the website.
[2616.84 --> 2620.12]  Yeah, I got to read these because it has five stars.
[2620.64 --> 2622.42]  And let me put it this way.
[2623.22 --> 2628.38]  I don't think if we released this product on LTTstore.com, it would have five stars.
[2629.04 --> 2634.44]  Because we, assuming they're not like spam or abusive, do not curate the reviews on our site.
[2634.64 --> 2637.06]  Have you looked at the, was this review helpful ratings?
[2638.24 --> 2639.14]  Oh, hold on a second.
[2639.38 --> 2642.32]  Floatplane is talking about TF cards.
[2642.42 --> 2647.60]  Do they seriously say it has, oh my God, it has TF card expansion.
[2648.64 --> 2651.68]  When's the last time you heard micro SD called Transflash?
[2653.16 --> 2656.06]  Like, I think like 2008.
[2656.06 --> 2658.38]  I'm not even kidding.
[2658.56 --> 2659.70]  It's been a minute.
[2659.94 --> 2660.14]  Yeah.
[2662.30 --> 2664.24]  Again, no offense.
[2664.42 --> 2668.88]  Like, to be clear, I think Logitech builds a lot of great products.
[2669.82 --> 2670.14]  Oh, yeah.
[2670.28 --> 2670.44]  Love.
[2670.60 --> 2670.90]  Definitely.
[2670.90 --> 2680.90]  I have personally received, even going back before I was like scary to not give good service to, I've received amazing customer service from Logitech.
[2681.58 --> 2682.68]  Logitech's one of my favorite brands.
[2682.84 --> 2684.66]  Mad respect for Logitech.
[2685.50 --> 2687.32]  This product page is atrocious.
[2687.54 --> 2688.22]  This ain't it, chief.
[2689.90 --> 2690.44]  Okay, so.
[2690.78 --> 2692.78]  Jump to the reviews or share my screen with you.
[2692.78 --> 2693.70]  I'm jumping to the reviews.
[2693.90 --> 2694.72]  Let's go.
[2694.72 --> 2696.92]  Look at the, was this review helpful section.
[2697.18 --> 2701.14]  A no brainer for the new wave in gaming.
[2701.30 --> 2702.84]  No, Luke, I need to read these.
[2702.96 --> 2704.30]  This is a no brainer.
[2704.70 --> 2707.96]  I don't think no brainer means what you think it means.
[2707.98 --> 2711.60]  These feel like they were written by a commission based retail store employee.
[2712.04 --> 2713.00]  No brainer.
[2713.24 --> 2715.18]  Because your brain fell out.
[2716.18 --> 2717.78]  It completely fell out.
[2717.82 --> 2718.34]  Out through your ear.
[2718.34 --> 2726.22]  I was hesitant because of the need for constant Wi-Fi, but the world is only going more and more cloud based.
[2726.66 --> 2727.54]  So get in now.
[2727.66 --> 2728.80]  You've got to get on the train.
[2728.80 --> 2729.86]  You're going to regret not having RTX.
[2730.12 --> 2734.96]  I took a couple days to really think about it and realize it's a no brainer.
[2735.40 --> 2739.36]  Applause for Logitech pushing the technology culture forward.
[2739.50 --> 2741.74]  That specific wording, I love.
[2741.90 --> 2744.74]  And looking forward to reviewing this as well.
[2745.50 --> 2747.04]  So you didn't review it.
[2747.04 --> 2752.10]  You just want the technology culture pushed forward.
[2752.50 --> 2754.08]  Thank you, Cyrus L.
[2754.50 --> 2754.90]  All right.
[2754.96 --> 2756.42]  Next up, we've got Martin.
[2756.42 --> 2762.66]  Cyrus, if you don't include something about the technology culture being pushed forward in your actual review, I'm going to be very disappointed.
[2763.16 --> 2764.42]  Logitech got it right.
[2765.60 --> 2773.20]  This is the definitive, perfect answer to a gap in the market that leverages unique opportunities that are booming in the last years.
[2773.20 --> 2778.66]  No idea.
[2778.66 --> 2781.70]  Handheld PC companions and cloud gaming.
[2782.12 --> 2787.68]  Incredible offering from Logitech to surf on that product line seems with a perfect answer.
[2788.20 --> 2790.78]  Looking forward to see how it has actually been executed.
[2790.78 --> 2792.68]  Only question right now.
[2793.00 --> 2793.62]  And then it ends.
[2794.00 --> 2794.40]  Okay.
[2794.52 --> 2797.34]  No, there's a tiny space after the M.
[2797.56 --> 2798.24]  Oh, I can click it.
[2798.24 --> 2798.66]  That you can click on.
[2798.98 --> 2801.72]  Why no SIM or eSIM slot?
[2802.08 --> 2804.08]  Well, because that would be terrible.
[2804.26 --> 2805.44]  And then they answer their own question.
[2805.46 --> 2805.64]  Yeah.
[2805.70 --> 2809.44]  Oh, but with the huge data consumption of cloud gaming, that would probably destroy your data plan in two days.
[2809.50 --> 2810.08]  Yes, that's it.
[2810.38 --> 2811.78]  Also, the latency sucks.
[2811.78 --> 2815.04]  Like, there's no way you'd want to play on mobile.
[2815.26 --> 2819.58]  So whatever employee wrote these added an FAQ at the end of one of their reviews, which is good.
[2823.10 --> 2826.76]  Dylan S. says, please release in the UK, please.
[2827.78 --> 2832.28]  And Kevin S., this is my personal favorite, it's American made.
[2832.62 --> 2832.86]  Yeah.
[2833.90 --> 2834.76]  No, it isn't.
[2835.52 --> 2838.90]  This device is a great new addition to the world of gaming.
[2838.90 --> 2839.36]  Is it?
[2839.36 --> 2841.80]  It has all the features you could look for in it.
[2842.30 --> 2842.72]  Okay.
[2842.88 --> 2846.00]  I think we need to examine this wording very closely.
[2846.38 --> 2851.66]  It has all the features that you could look for in it.
[2852.78 --> 2856.68]  So if you could look for the feature in it, then it has it.
[2856.84 --> 2858.10]  I don't know if that's true.
[2858.94 --> 2864.18]  And finally, it does, and I quote, everything right.
[2866.10 --> 2867.94]  Okay, look at the, was this review helpful?
[2869.36 --> 2870.10]  Oh, yeah.
[2870.24 --> 2878.18]  These people, supposed people, are getting absolutely slayed by the thumbs up and thumbs down ratings.
[2878.36 --> 2884.48]  Which is very interesting to me because the Logitech Got Everything Right by Martin has 65 dislikes.
[2884.60 --> 2884.76]  Yeah.
[2885.04 --> 2891.48]  If there was that many dislikes, you'd think that someone would click the write a review button and write a negative review.
[2891.64 --> 2893.82]  But there is only five star reviews.
[2894.30 --> 2894.70]  Yeah.
[2894.70 --> 2897.26]  So are they filtering it so that you can only see?
[2897.44 --> 2898.22]  I have an idea.
[2899.60 --> 2900.82]  I'm going to write a review.
[2901.32 --> 2903.20]  I think it has to be a five star one to show up.
[2903.34 --> 2904.68]  But we can do some science.
[2904.86 --> 2905.14]  We'll find out.
[2905.22 --> 2908.72]  I'm going to do a two star because I don't want to be overly negative.
[2908.72 --> 2912.74]  I'm going to go with title.
[2913.32 --> 2915.22]  Logitech has their work cut out for them.
[2915.34 --> 2917.52]  To be clear, I don't want this to be spam, right?
[2917.68 --> 2918.24]  Like I'm not.
[2918.62 --> 2918.82]  Yeah.
[2918.88 --> 2919.72]  You should never leave a spam review.
[2919.72 --> 2920.40]  We're writing a real review.
[2920.62 --> 2921.22]  Yes, agreed.
[2921.36 --> 2924.06]  And I'm not going to misrepresent it.
[2924.10 --> 2925.56]  I'm not going to act like I own it.
[2925.74 --> 2927.14]  I don't think you need to, so that's okay.
[2927.14 --> 2933.28]  But if Logitech's line, okay, if Logitech's line is that you have to be a verified purchaser,
[2933.46 --> 2935.14]  then okay, fair enough.
[2935.22 --> 2935.66]  No, it's not.
[2936.16 --> 2937.50]  Well, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[2937.60 --> 2937.80]  Yeah.
[2938.00 --> 2939.52]  Like if that's the line, then fine.
[2939.58 --> 2940.50]  That's where the line is.
[2940.56 --> 2941.64]  But then you need to be consistent.
[2941.78 --> 2945.40]  Then the people leaving it five star reviews should also have their reviews wiped out, right?
[2945.72 --> 2949.18]  I think verified reviewer means purchaser.
[2949.28 --> 2949.40]  Yeah.
[2949.46 --> 2950.76]  So some of them are, some of them aren't.
[2950.82 --> 2951.26]  Yeah, exactly.
[2951.26 --> 2956.88]  And to be clear, you know, I'm not saying that, you know, your moderation will be perfect.
[2957.06 --> 2963.54]  Like I promise you, there are reviews on LTT Store from people who didn't buy it that are positive that we didn't remove.
[2963.92 --> 2967.22]  Because usually it's just a case of nobody flagged it to us.
[2967.36 --> 2973.76]  Like it wasn't so egregiously spam that it didn't get flagged.
[2973.76 --> 2980.76]  But what that means is that the way our system works is things go up by default and then are pulled down.
[2981.28 --> 2992.20]  So what we're testing right now is to see if a reasonable, balanced review, one word that where I didn't buy it, but neither did some of the other people, will make it through to their site.
[2993.14 --> 2994.78]  So do you want to do another topic?
[2995.04 --> 2997.20]  Oh, do you want to do sponsor spots while I type up my review?
[2997.56 --> 2997.58]  Sure.
[2997.58 --> 2997.78]  Yeah, let's do it.
[2997.80 --> 2999.02]  And then you'll read it to us when you're done?
[2999.22 --> 2999.40]  Sure.
[2999.52 --> 3000.32]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3000.58 --> 3000.90]  Okay.
[3001.44 --> 3002.12]  Okay, let's go.
[3002.28 --> 3002.78]  Let's go.
[3002.78 --> 3004.00]  Can you throw sponsors for me?
[3007.82 --> 3008.70]  Yeah, go for it.

[3180.90 --> 3182.04]  Also, another one.
[3182.10 --> 3183.46]  I'm going to get him a little bit more time.
[3183.74 --> 3184.44]  LTT Store.
[3184.60 --> 3185.22]  Deal of the week.
[3185.36 --> 3187.90]  Get four Elemental shirts for only $50.
[3188.30 --> 3190.54]  The discount is applied automatically at checkout.
[3190.80 --> 3192.96]  You can mix and match at your own will.
[3193.08 --> 3196.80]  I believe you could even get four of the same one if you're into that type of thing.
[3196.92 --> 3201.16]  I know a few people that just like having the same stuff all the time, so you could do that.
[3201.16 --> 3202.70]  So check it out.
[3202.78 --> 3202.90]  Yeah.
[3203.02 --> 3203.92]  LTT Store.com.
[3204.28 --> 3204.96]  Elemental shirts.
[3205.50 --> 3209.76]  They're good quality shirts, and four for $50 is a really good price.
[3209.98 --> 3212.04]  There's also the LTT cargo shorts.
[3212.72 --> 3213.80]  Oh, dang!
[3213.98 --> 3214.82]  Yeah, go buy them.
[3214.82 --> 3218.40]  I heard about that earlier, but I didn't know that was actually a thing.
[3218.56 --> 3218.94]  They are.
[3219.04 --> 3219.90]  It's on the store right now.
[3219.98 --> 3220.36]  Whoa.
[3222.04 --> 3222.48]  Whoa!
[3222.48 --> 3222.80]  Whoa!
[3226.42 --> 3226.82]  Cool.
[3227.22 --> 3230.04]  We're looking at, I think, Riley's Junk right now.
[3230.16 --> 3230.50]  Sort of.
[3231.06 --> 3232.64]  Sorry, Riley, but you're wearing the shorts.
[3232.64 --> 3232.90]  Do I want to share your screen?
[3233.18 --> 3233.86]  Yeah, why not?
[3239.02 --> 3239.72]  That's not it.
[3241.22 --> 3241.58]  Hey!
[3242.50 --> 3243.20]  There's Riley.
[3245.10 --> 3245.46]  Yeah.
[3245.70 --> 3248.40]  I don't necessarily know what to say about them, but they look good.
[3248.54 --> 3250.96]  Oh, there's lots of cool things to say about them, actually.
[3250.96 --> 3252.30]  They have magnetic flaps.
[3252.70 --> 3253.50]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[3253.52 --> 3257.60]  But they're like flat magnets, so they don't show a lot.
[3258.34 --> 3259.16]  Yeah, you can't really tell.
[3259.16 --> 3259.76]  I don't think.
[3259.76 --> 3259.90]  Yeah.
[3259.90 --> 3262.02]  I think you can sort of see it right there, but not really.
[3262.16 --> 3262.42]  Not much.
[3262.42 --> 3263.98]  It looks like a design feature, if anything.
[3264.18 --> 3264.36]  Yep.
[3265.16 --> 3267.52]  They're super comfy, in my opinion.
[3267.52 --> 3268.26]  They look great.
[3268.54 --> 3270.08]  And I like magnets.
[3272.00 --> 3273.66]  What else could I say?
[3273.66 --> 3275.24]  Very cool.
[3275.42 --> 3275.56]  Yeah.
[3275.56 --> 3277.74]  2% spandex, so they got a little bit of the-
[3277.74 --> 3278.24]  A little bit of stretch.
[3278.26 --> 3278.98]  A little bit of the stretchy.
[3279.18 --> 3279.30]  Yeah.
[3279.30 --> 3279.58]  That's good.
[3279.82 --> 3280.82]  But not a ton.
[3280.88 --> 3283.60]  You're not going to feel like you're wearing yoga shorts or whatever.
[3283.66 --> 3284.04]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3284.04 --> 3284.34]  Exactly.
[3284.64 --> 3285.30]  Don't really want that.
[3285.54 --> 3286.50]  Seven useful pockets.
[3286.68 --> 3287.64]  Is there back pockets?
[3288.94 --> 3289.52]  Oh, man.
[3289.54 --> 3289.82]  I forget.
[3289.90 --> 3290.40]  I'm pretty sure.
[3290.64 --> 3291.72]  I'm pretty sure there's back pockets.
[3291.72 --> 3292.60]  Someone's butt in here, probably.
[3292.60 --> 3292.84]  There we go.
[3292.84 --> 3293.32]  There we go.
[3293.54 --> 3293.74]  Yep.
[3293.74 --> 3294.40]  There's your back pocket.
[3294.50 --> 3294.68]  Thanks, Riley.
[3295.90 --> 3296.22]  Cool.
[3296.22 --> 3297.10]  Heck yeah, right?
[3297.88 --> 3298.80]  Lots of different sizes.
[3299.52 --> 3300.42]  Get the phone in there.
[3301.96 --> 3303.42]  That's a good way of showing that off.
[3303.80 --> 3304.16]  Yeah.
[3304.34 --> 3304.90]  Oh, love it.
[3304.94 --> 3305.44]  Screwed over a bit.
[3305.60 --> 3306.04]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3306.30 --> 3307.08]  There you go.
[3309.78 --> 3310.14]  Cool.
[3310.34 --> 3311.24]  Yeah, we worked on these for a long time.
[3311.24 --> 3312.30]  Oh, is that intentional?
[3312.46 --> 3314.28]  It's like a pocket for headphones?
[3314.44 --> 3315.08]  Of course.
[3315.22 --> 3315.70]  Very cool.
[3315.90 --> 3316.30]  Very cool.
[3316.32 --> 3317.26]  It's always intentional.
[3317.50 --> 3318.68]  Always intentional, sir.
[3320.28 --> 3320.52]  Sweet.
[3320.52 --> 3321.10]  Oh, my God.
[3321.10 --> 3323.06]  Did he tuck his T-shirt into cargo shorts?
[3323.18 --> 3323.88]  I think he did.
[3325.28 --> 3326.24]  What a boss.
[3326.48 --> 3326.70]  All right.
[3326.70 --> 3327.12]  He's a winner.
[3327.28 --> 3327.68]  All right.
[3327.80 --> 3328.04]  Yeah.
[3328.18 --> 3328.86]  He's a winner.
[3329.02 --> 3329.26]  All right.
[3329.28 --> 3330.62]  So let's go back to my screen here.
[3331.00 --> 3332.10]  He wins the dad games.
[3332.22 --> 3333.36]  I have written my review.
[3333.74 --> 3334.06]  All right.
[3334.08 --> 3334.68]  Let's hear it.
[3334.80 --> 3335.12]  Okay.
[3336.34 --> 3336.76]  Well, here.
[3336.88 --> 3338.02]  We'll just go to me.
[3339.52 --> 3340.60]  Score two stars.
[3342.08 --> 3342.44]  Title.
[3342.72 --> 3344.48]  Logitech has their work cut out for them.
[3344.88 --> 3345.68]  Here's my review.
[3346.00 --> 3349.94]  The challenge for Logitech here is not that I feel there is a lack of demand for a cloud streaming
[3349.94 --> 3350.38]  handheld.
[3350.62 --> 3354.66]  I look forward to being hands-on, and my expectations for the quality of the control and the display
[3354.66 --> 3357.66]  are very high given Logitech's reputation for building excellent peripherals.
[3358.08 --> 3362.58]  However, it feels like this product was conceptualized and designed at a time when competing gaming
[3362.58 --> 3366.22]  handhelds were not yet available, and it's a major problem for Logitech that there are
[3366.22 --> 3372.64]  other devices for $50 to $100 more that can not only game via cloud services, but also
[3372.64 --> 3375.16]  locally due to their much more powerful hardware.
[3375.16 --> 3378.58]  So it may not be bad, but it's awkwardly positioned.
[3379.16 --> 3384.08]  At $150, I could see it making sense, but that would require aggressive cost savings on
[3384.08 --> 3392.68]  the bomb, which could hurt the experience and make it feel cheap and ultimately reflect
[3392.68 --> 3394.08]  poorly on the Logitech brand.
[3394.52 --> 3399.54]  It feels like a device that just doesn't have a place at the price it costs to build.
[3399.54 --> 3406.16]  Use your name, Linus Sebastian, email, linustechtips.gmail.com, and we'll go ahead and post.
[3407.16 --> 3414.00]  So it looks like that did, in fact, go up, and all that remains to be seen is whether it
[3414.00 --> 3414.50]  stays.
[3414.82 --> 3415.82]  Oh, no, it didn't.
[3415.94 --> 3416.36]  Oh, crap.
[3416.40 --> 3417.22]  You guys missed this.
[3417.72 --> 3419.50]  Mine went up for a second.
[3419.70 --> 3420.68]  Yeah, I never saw it.
[3420.72 --> 3422.18]  And then I refreshed, and it was gone.
[3422.86 --> 3423.80]  Yeah, it's not there for me.
[3424.16 --> 3424.48]  Okay.
[3424.48 --> 3424.60]  Okay.
[3425.18 --> 3428.74]  So what we've confirmed then is that whatever other...
[3428.74 --> 3429.82]  There's some form of filtering.
[3430.00 --> 3434.74]  Either they'll have to be manually approved, or it's only five star, or something.
[3434.98 --> 3441.74]  Whatever other good things that Logitech has done, they are clearly suppressing real feedback
[3441.74 --> 3445.42]  on this product in a way that I'm not like a super huge fan of.
[3445.44 --> 3446.58]  Obviously, you don't want spam.
[3446.58 --> 3447.14]  There is...
[3447.14 --> 3447.74]  There is...
[3447.74 --> 3449.24]  People will...
[3449.24 --> 3454.86]  If you have it completely open, people will post things that are not okay to have on your
[3454.86 --> 3455.18]  website.
[3455.28 --> 3455.46]  Yep.
[3456.20 --> 3459.68]  So, like, you do need some form of filtering, to be fair.
[3459.88 --> 3464.96]  I just find it extremely suspicious that with this much negative interaction, like the
[3464.96 --> 3471.26]  70 dislikes on one of these reviews, that there are zero reviews that have any form of real
[3471.26 --> 3474.80]  negative content in them, or don't rate it five stars.
[3475.46 --> 3475.68]  Yeah.
[3475.68 --> 3477.68]  That's super, super, super sus.
[3479.32 --> 3483.38]  People are saying the reviews button is gone from the main page now, so you can't even
[3483.38 --> 3484.30]  get to the review page.
[3485.28 --> 3485.64]  Really?
[3485.94 --> 3486.02]  What?
[3486.72 --> 3487.72]  It's there for me.
[3487.84 --> 3488.70]  That doesn't seem right.
[3488.82 --> 3489.02]  Yeah.
[3489.38 --> 3490.28]  It's there for me.
[3490.34 --> 3490.36]  I saw it.
[3490.38 --> 3492.48]  I was able to navigate away, and I was able to go to it again.
[3492.58 --> 3493.66]  I've even been like...
[3493.66 --> 3495.72]  I'm in the process of typing a five star review.
[3496.46 --> 3496.74]  Oh.
[3497.06 --> 3499.76]  It's amazing that Logitech has seen the future and built this product.
[3499.86 --> 3502.58]  It's like they're looking into my mind and seeing what I want and building it before
[3502.58 --> 3504.20]  I can even think of it.
[3505.26 --> 3505.66]  Logitech...
[3505.68 --> 3507.38]  Thank you for bringing...
[3507.38 --> 3510.42]  I didn't know I've been waiting for this my whole life.
[3510.82 --> 3511.10]  Oh.
[3511.20 --> 3513.64]  Thank you for bringing the cloud future to the present.
[3513.64 --> 3524.48]  I only just now realized I have been waiting for this product my whole life.
[3524.88 --> 3526.12]  Use your name, Luke.
[3526.78 --> 3527.84]  My friend here.
[3528.50 --> 3529.04]  Esquire.
[3529.04 --> 3530.24]  Darn it.
[3530.24 --> 3531.56]  I'll take it.
[3533.66 --> 3534.06]  Okay.
[3534.12 --> 3534.60]  Let's go.
[3534.82 --> 3535.34]  Let's go.
[3535.48 --> 3535.76]  Okay.
[3535.82 --> 3536.40]  You guys ready?
[3536.48 --> 3537.00]  You guys ready?
[3537.30 --> 3538.04]  Let's post.
[3538.16 --> 3538.70]  Let's see.
[3539.30 --> 3539.66]  Okay.
[3539.88 --> 3540.54]  Luke E.
[3540.68 --> 3540.98]  Here.
[3541.54 --> 3542.72]  I love this thing.
[3542.82 --> 3543.04]  Okay.
[3543.28 --> 3543.66]  Refresh.
[3543.66 --> 3545.36]  It's gone.
[3545.36 --> 3545.40]  It's gone.
[3546.62 --> 3547.40]  And it's gone.
[3547.74 --> 3549.22]  So it's got to be manual review.
[3549.22 --> 3550.24]  But I can subscribe to Logitech G.
[3550.32 --> 3551.32]  So yeah, it appears to be...
[3551.32 --> 3551.82]  It's got to be manual review.
[3552.14 --> 3556.34]  Let's see if anyone from Logitech watches WAN show and if they accidentally let the Luke
[3556.34 --> 3557.74]  Esquire review through.
[3558.12 --> 3560.10]  You guys are going to keep an eye on this for us, right?
[3560.20 --> 3560.84]  You need to.
[3560.94 --> 3561.10]  Yeah.
[3561.10 --> 3563.84]  I think someone's going to tip someone off at Logitech.
[3564.00 --> 3564.66]  Oh, probably.
[3564.84 --> 3568.64]  Apparently the Canadian site has no review option, but the US site does.
[3568.82 --> 3569.30]  Got it.
[3569.38 --> 3569.88]  Got it.
[3569.90 --> 3570.16]  Okay.
[3570.86 --> 3571.26]  Yeah.
[3571.38 --> 3572.38]  It's just a bummer.
[3572.52 --> 3574.74]  The 64 gig Steam Deck is $399.
[3575.08 --> 3578.60]  And you can easily look at the 64 gig Steam Deck and go, yeah, that's not enough storage.
[3578.60 --> 3579.44]  It's a stupid device.
[3580.06 --> 3582.34]  But then the Logitech one doesn't have any storage.
[3582.50 --> 3582.68]  Yeah.
[3582.74 --> 3585.10]  So you could have some local games.
[3585.26 --> 3589.74]  It's better than nothing, which is what it's competing against at this price point.
[3589.74 --> 3591.88]  Like Steam Deck pricing is wild.
[3592.38 --> 3596.18]  Valve basically came in, slapped their gigantic deck on the table.
[3596.66 --> 3599.24]  And we're like, yeah, we're just like not going to make money.
[3599.48 --> 3604.30]  So we talked about a lot at the launch that the deck was very aggressively priced.
[3604.32 --> 3606.16]  I saw people complaining about the pricing.
[3606.16 --> 3609.38]  I was like, are you, have you lost your pickles?
[3609.72 --> 3612.66]  We've said since the very beginning that the pricing of the deck was very aggressive.
[3612.92 --> 3613.72]  And this shows you.
[3614.14 --> 3614.64]  I could see.
[3614.72 --> 3615.24]  Yeah, exactly.
[3615.44 --> 3615.54]  Yeah.
[3615.54 --> 3619.90]  Logitech's got some crappy, anemic Snapdragon 720G in here.
[3619.96 --> 3631.38]  And they still have to put it on $50 promo or whatever to get within a reasonable shot of what Valve is doing with the deck.
[3632.08 --> 3634.06]  Snapdragon 720G.
[3634.12 --> 3634.80]  When did that come out?
[3634.96 --> 3637.86]  Announced on January in 2020.
[3638.34 --> 3639.42]  Because here, here's the thing.
[3639.56 --> 3642.94]  If the deck didn't exist, what would you think of this pricing?
[3642.94 --> 3643.06]  Yeah.
[3643.06 --> 3643.10]  Yeah.
[3643.10 --> 3643.16]  Yeah.
[3643.16 --> 3643.60]  Yeah.
[3643.60 --> 3647.84]  Might be all right.
[3648.06 --> 3648.26]  Yeah.
[3648.52 --> 3648.72]  Yeah.
[3648.72 --> 3656.08]  Because looking at what Windows handhelds from companies that are not able to subsidize with 30% Steam game revenue, right?
[3656.26 --> 3661.34]  Like, Aya Neo has the Air, which is like, what?
[3661.42 --> 3662.64]  Starts at like $650.
[3662.96 --> 3664.46]  So yeah, it costs half as much.
[3665.04 --> 3669.22]  Probably like feels pretty good, but only does like cloud streaming.
[3669.74 --> 3670.98]  I mean, I know people.
[3671.40 --> 3672.42]  There's some cloud subscriptions.
[3672.42 --> 3676.12]  I don't like them, but there's some cloud subscriptions that get you a lot of games.
[3676.16 --> 3676.28]  Yeah.
[3676.34 --> 3680.40]  And there's people who bought PS Vitas basically exclusively to stream from their PlayStation.
[3680.74 --> 3680.90]  Yeah.
[3681.08 --> 3681.72]  That's a thing.
[3681.90 --> 3686.20]  That is a use case where they're only even going to use it at home, right?
[3686.88 --> 3688.84]  And if I was only using this thing at home, yeah.
[3690.12 --> 3690.48]  Yeah.
[3690.54 --> 3691.44]  At that price.
[3691.44 --> 3696.90]  It would still be one of those weird curiosity, like in between products to me.
[3697.14 --> 3697.46]  For sure.
[3697.58 --> 3701.74]  But the pricing, if the deck didn't exist, I would not have been surprised.
[3701.92 --> 3703.70]  I wouldn't have said the same thing that I said about the deck.
[3703.80 --> 3705.38]  Like, whoa, the pricing here is so crazy.
[3705.52 --> 3705.66]  Yeah.
[3706.04 --> 3707.34]  But I would have been like, yeah.
[3707.44 --> 3708.04]  I mean, it's a...
[3708.04 --> 3708.60]  Yeah, I get it.
[3708.74 --> 3708.96]  Yeah.
[3709.44 --> 3710.16]  It's a screen.
[3710.74 --> 3712.46]  It's got a motherboard in it.
[3712.54 --> 3715.28]  They have to pay back the R&D cost somehow.
[3715.28 --> 3716.64]  A low volume product.
[3716.82 --> 3716.92]  Yeah.
[3716.94 --> 3717.62]  Like...
[3717.62 --> 3717.86]  Yep.
[3718.30 --> 3718.54]  Yeah.
[3718.56 --> 3719.06]  A hundred percent.
[3719.38 --> 3719.66]  Yeah.
[3719.80 --> 3720.18]  I don't know.
[3720.30 --> 3720.56]  A hard degree.
[3720.82 --> 3724.38]  But in a world where the deck does exist, this is a little out to lunch.
[3725.50 --> 3728.16]  In a world where merch messages exist...
[3728.16 --> 3728.84]  There's a lot of them.
[3728.86 --> 3731.82]  Sending super chats and Twitch bits is out to lunch.
[3732.22 --> 3737.54]  So you guys, if you want to send a merch message, all you got to do, head over to lttstore.com.
[3737.86 --> 3740.78]  Check out either the Elemental t-shirt deal.
[3740.88 --> 3744.28]  So we're doing four t-shirts for 50 US dollars.
[3744.28 --> 3747.90]  They're basically the only shirts we have in stock right now.
[3748.38 --> 3751.28]  Because long story short, we were...
[3751.88 --> 3755.50]  A. Not able to get product consistently from American Apparel.
[3755.90 --> 3760.38]  And B. Knew that we were not able to get product consistently from American Apparel.
[3760.48 --> 3763.48]  So we've been working on our own branded shirts for quite some time.
[3764.10 --> 3769.34]  And so we've kind of allowed our American Apparel shirts to kind of go away.
[3769.34 --> 3776.16]  Also, we launched Screwdriver, which sold like 60,000 units or 50,000 units in the first week or something like that.
[3776.22 --> 3778.76]  So we obviously, alongside those orders, sold a lot of t-shirts.
[3779.30 --> 3780.48]  So there's like...
[3780.48 --> 3783.34]  It's a t-shirt wasteland on the site.
[3783.60 --> 3785.34]  Except for good old Elemental.
[3786.34 --> 3787.98]  Our worst selling design.
[3788.12 --> 3791.36]  Except when we do promos for Elemental.
[3791.36 --> 3791.84]  So...
[3791.84 --> 3793.22]  You know what's really funny?
[3793.54 --> 3796.68]  Is like a lot of mornings, I actually grab the Elemental shirt.
[3797.40 --> 3797.92]  Just like...
[3797.92 --> 3798.56]  They're solid.
[3798.94 --> 3799.84]  It's just as...
[3799.84 --> 3800.52]  It's the same blank.
[3800.58 --> 3802.02]  So it's just as comfy as all the other ones.
[3802.06 --> 3802.24]  Yep.
[3802.96 --> 3803.66]  And it's just...
[3803.66 --> 3804.90]  Just simple LTT logo.
[3805.04 --> 3806.20]  Got four different colors.
[3806.66 --> 3807.52]  So guys, check them out.
[3807.58 --> 3809.52]  You can get four Elemental shirts.
[3809.76 --> 3813.06]  So it works out to like $13 each or something like that.
[3814.38 --> 3815.18]  Like less than that.
[3815.22 --> 3816.54]  Like $12.50 each or something.
[3817.10 --> 3819.58]  And then we also obviously launched Cargo Shorts.
[3819.74 --> 3822.34]  So either your message will show down here.
[3822.38 --> 3824.78]  If you want to do like a shout out for your mom or your friends.
[3824.90 --> 3826.74]  Assuming your mom and your friends watch WAN show.
[3826.92 --> 3827.60]  I mean, I don't know.
[3827.62 --> 3828.24]  My mom does.
[3828.34 --> 3828.52]  Yeah.
[3828.62 --> 3829.20]  Hey, there you go.
[3829.20 --> 3829.36]  Hi, mom.
[3829.54 --> 3830.64]  So you can do a shout out.
[3830.78 --> 3834.02]  Or you can ask a simple question.
[3834.46 --> 3836.90]  And our producer, Jake Belavance, can answer.
[3837.04 --> 3837.20]  Oh.
[3837.56 --> 3839.62]  The producer cam is not pointed at you, Jake.
[3840.44 --> 3840.80]  Good.
[3840.98 --> 3842.26]  So you can't sneak up on me.
[3842.40 --> 3842.84]  Oh, I see.
[3844.54 --> 3845.82]  Oh, did you do that on purpose?
[3846.78 --> 3847.14]  Anyway.
[3848.34 --> 3849.96]  So a bell might answer you.
[3850.04 --> 3851.48]  And then your answer will show up down there.
[3851.48 --> 3854.48]  Or if you have like a more complicated thing, then he might throw it to us.
[3855.00 --> 3856.56]  So you just go.
[3856.78 --> 3858.88]  You can look in the checkout on LTTstore.com.
[3858.94 --> 3859.92]  You'll see a field to fill out.
[3859.92 --> 3861.92]  So that's what we do instead of Super Chats.
[3862.06 --> 3863.74]  Instead of like Twitch.
[3864.16 --> 3864.52]  Whatever.
[3864.70 --> 3866.48]  However people throw money at people on Twitch.
[3867.40 --> 3867.70]  All right.
[3867.72 --> 3868.78]  What did you want to talk about next?
[3871.40 --> 3871.96]  Oh, yeah.
[3872.02 --> 3872.44]  And we're going to.
[3872.56 --> 3873.92]  We'll answer Super Chats.
[3874.08 --> 3874.60]  Super Chats.
[3874.68 --> 3874.96]  Dang it.
[3874.96 --> 3877.34]  We'll answer merch messages at the end of the show.
[3877.74 --> 3878.02]  Wow.
[3878.28 --> 3881.80]  So people had complained about there being too much merch messages interspersed.
[3881.90 --> 3882.88]  I want to know more about this.
[3883.08 --> 3884.54]  Linus Tech Tips Espanol.
[3885.58 --> 3886.76]  Oh, this is so exciting.
[3886.76 --> 3887.14]  Talk to me about it.
[3887.18 --> 3890.46]  Because I heard Grapevine stuff about this in the past.
[3890.60 --> 3892.46]  But I didn't know this was actually like happening now.
[3892.64 --> 3893.08]  Oh, yes.
[3893.20 --> 3893.48]  So.
[3893.48 --> 3900.10]  Ed has been putting some serious business work into LTT en Espanol.
[3900.10 --> 3901.54]  And let's go ahead.
[3901.66 --> 3902.04]  I'm sorry.
[3902.12 --> 3903.44]  I do not speak Spanish.
[3903.76 --> 3904.06]  Oh, yeah.
[3904.06 --> 3906.16]  I don't even pretend to speak any Spanish.
[3906.16 --> 3906.32]  No.
[3906.32 --> 3909.28]  So my accent is surely atrocious.
[3909.68 --> 3912.80]  But let's go ahead and pop this bad boy up here.
[3912.88 --> 3915.12]  I believe my audio should be working.
[3915.48 --> 3915.92]  But.
[3916.14 --> 3916.46]  Or here.
[3916.46 --> 3918.24]  I'll walk you through what you're about to see first.
[3918.36 --> 3919.22]  And then I'll show it to you.
[3919.72 --> 3922.44]  We're taking the original video.
[3922.80 --> 3923.02]  Okay.
[3923.10 --> 3925.00]  So in this case, it's a clip from.
[3926.00 --> 3926.94]  I forget which one.
[3926.98 --> 3927.48]  But it doesn't matter.
[3927.54 --> 3930.32]  The point is, this is a very, very short video clip.
[3930.38 --> 3934.32]  But we've actually done it on a much, much longer video.
[3934.32 --> 3936.06]  And it does scale.
[3936.06 --> 3942.12]  I believe the video that you're going to see it come out on first is the dash cam video that we did recently.
[3942.12 --> 3951.68]  And what we're doing is we are using like a voice to text service to transcribe the input audio to English.
[3951.92 --> 3954.40]  So then we get an English version of the script.
[3954.98 --> 3957.80]  Then, obviously, there needs to be a little bit of cleanup.
[3957.80 --> 3969.38]  We are then taking that English text and using like AI natural language translation to translate it into Spanish text, which is all like.
[3969.88 --> 3970.48]  Yeah.
[3970.86 --> 3971.22]  And.
[3971.94 --> 3972.08]  Right.
[3972.12 --> 3976.18]  Like you've been able to use Google Translate to do that for an awful long time.
[3976.30 --> 3976.54]  Oh, yeah.
[3976.88 --> 3977.00]  Yep.
[3977.32 --> 3977.58]  Okay.
[3977.62 --> 3979.18]  Now, here's where things get really wild.
[3979.76 --> 3995.36]  Next stage is a text to speech with an AI generated voice that not only creates the voice from absolutely nothing, but attempts to handle the timing of the delivery.
[3996.42 --> 3996.54]  Okay.
[3996.72 --> 4000.70]  So I still think that has problems with emotion, right?
[4000.70 --> 4001.70]  It tries.
[4001.70 --> 4003.86]  Uh, it tries.
[4004.02 --> 4004.32]  Okay.
[4004.32 --> 4004.70]  Wow.
[4004.84 --> 4005.08]  Okay.
[4005.08 --> 4008.86]  It tries, but, um, it's, it's tough.
[4008.86 --> 4012.24]  So the next stage, hold on a second.
[4012.24 --> 4012.26]  Hold on a second.
[4012.26 --> 4013.62]  Is this the one where he sent it?
[4013.62 --> 4013.80]  Yeah.
[4013.80 --> 4014.04]  Cool.
[4014.04 --> 4018.14]  So you can watch along with us if you want, because I have this right here.
[4018.14 --> 4019.96]  So you can just take that.
[4019.96 --> 4020.14]  Okay.
[4020.14 --> 4021.56]  And then you can watch while we're watching.
[4021.56 --> 4021.92]  Okay.
[4021.92 --> 4023.14]  Maybe just turn your audio on away from that.
[4023.14 --> 4023.86]  Not yet though.
[4024.06 --> 4024.46]  Not yet.
[4024.46 --> 4041.26]  So after we create the AI generated voice version, the robot voice gets naturalized with AI into a recording from a voice actor's voice, like into, into another voice that's based on a recording from a voice actor.
[4041.26 --> 4044.28]  But that's just like a voice print recording.
[4044.28 --> 4044.48]  Okay.
[4044.58 --> 4046.52]  So it's not a voice actor who read the script.
[4046.72 --> 4050.52]  No, there's no voice actor involved at any stage in this process.
[4051.16 --> 4054.20]  Then this is wild.
[4054.56 --> 4062.28]  After the whole process is done, we find any sentences where the timing of the delivery is not quite right.
[4062.28 --> 4066.96]  But, you know, with like a, you know, you're going to see in this, there's like a punch in.
[4067.58 --> 4070.28]  And so the delivery is like kind of timed weird.
[4070.50 --> 4075.68]  And we can spot fix it ourselves by just yakking into a microphone.
[4075.68 --> 4080.24]  Like the editor could just like do their best Spanish impression at their desk.
[4080.24 --> 4099.68]  And then it would, we'd use the same AI voice editing process to turn instead of the robot voice into the actor's voice, our editor's voice into the actor's voice for hopelessly, hopelessly, hopefully a seamless viewing experience.
[4099.98 --> 4103.48]  Now, all that sounds pie in the sky.
[4103.72 --> 4104.00]  Sure does.
[4104.48 --> 4107.58]  Loudface Bob says this seems incredibly overcomplicated.
[4107.88 --> 4108.66]  Well, what else?
[4108.68 --> 4109.44]  How else would you do it?
[4111.24 --> 4112.68]  You'd have to hire someone.
[4112.90 --> 4121.40]  Yeah, you'd have to hire, like, I can tell you right now, managing a team of translators and voice actors, also complicated.
[4122.42 --> 4124.08]  Like, yes, it's complicated.
[4124.28 --> 4127.08]  But what it also could be is scalable.
[4128.00 --> 4131.54]  And yes, cleanup is required in the translation as well.
[4132.80 --> 4136.24]  So, this sounds like it's going to be a disaster, says Squidvorb.
[4136.98 --> 4137.36]  All right.
[4137.36 --> 4140.64]  You guys ready?
[4141.60 --> 4141.96]  Yeah.
[4142.46 --> 4142.80]  Okay.
[4144.12 --> 4150.72]  Hopefully, you guys have my audio here, but you're going to see each step that I just described, one after the other, after the other.
[4151.40 --> 4152.24]  So, ready, Luke?
[4152.26 --> 4153.74]  Why don't we press go at the same time here?
[4153.92 --> 4154.64]  Do you have audio?
[4155.38 --> 4156.02]  Double check.
[4157.40 --> 4158.98]  That's probably adjusting ringer volume.
[4159.62 --> 4160.14]  Oh, no, you're good.
[4160.14 --> 4160.44]  Okay.
[4160.84 --> 4162.06]  Three, two, one.
[4162.26 --> 4163.00]  Let's go.
[4163.00 --> 4163.06]  Let's go.
[4163.06 --> 4164.04]  Let's go.
[4167.04 --> 4184.46]  Oh, people are saying they can't hear it.
[4184.46 --> 4187.70]  Bell, I thought we checked this.
[4190.70 --> 4193.80]  I heard it.
[4193.90 --> 4194.92]  Get wrecked, audience.
[4197.50 --> 4197.94]  Losers!
[4197.96 --> 4199.28]  I see levels.
[4201.14 --> 4202.68]  So, what's the deal with that?
[4202.68 --> 4205.12]  I thought we, yeah.
[4205.68 --> 4206.68]  We have no...
[4206.68 --> 4212.92]  Can you check the OBS advanced audio properties or whatever and make sure it's actually taking that source?
[4212.98 --> 4213.54]  Sorry, guys.
[4214.10 --> 4216.48]  I mean, I guess we've kind of spoiled it a bit now.
[4216.58 --> 4218.58]  It was supposed to be all impressive and stuff.
[4220.78 --> 4222.96]  I want to, like, talk about it, but I need to...
[4222.96 --> 4225.64]  I'm going to not until you guys can see it as well.
[4225.64 --> 4226.68]  I know, I know, right?
[4226.78 --> 4227.96]  Then we can discuss it together.
[4228.46 --> 4228.78]  Yeah.
[4229.78 --> 4230.10]  Sweet.
[4231.06 --> 4231.28]  Should we do...
[4231.28 --> 4233.58]  People are saying it was very quiet.
[4234.72 --> 4236.12]  Oh, like it was picked up by Mike.
[4236.22 --> 4236.52]  Yeah, yeah.
[4236.56 --> 4238.32]  That was probably Luke.
[4238.62 --> 4238.80]  Yeah.
[4239.00 --> 4239.18]  Yeah.
[4240.04 --> 4241.66]  It probably was just picked up.
[4241.82 --> 4248.70]  Failing, failing getting this working properly, I'll just hold that up to the microphone and we'll call it a day.
[4248.96 --> 4249.08]  Yeah.
[4249.68 --> 4250.80]  Do you want me to read our merch message?
[4251.24 --> 4251.80]  Sure, yeah.
[4251.86 --> 4255.36]  Why don't we do a merch message while Bell tries to figure out what's going on with that audio source?
[4257.74 --> 4258.64]  Hey, Linus and Luke.
[4258.64 --> 4260.76]  First time sending a message.
[4260.90 --> 4262.56]  It's 3 a.m. in the Netherlands.
[4263.00 --> 4266.08]  GPU prices are still high here, but CPUs are fine.
[4266.62 --> 4268.28]  3080s are still over a grand.
[4268.74 --> 4271.04]  Why do you think this is, and do you think it'll improve?
[4271.84 --> 4275.16]  I think it is probably for a combination of reasons.
[4275.16 --> 4285.18]  It could be old stock that retailers paid that much for and are clinging to hope that they can recoup their investment on.
[4285.18 --> 4288.38]  The retailers all kind of being like, hey, you want to not lower?
[4288.92 --> 4289.42]  Yeah, cool.
[4289.70 --> 4290.74]  That's not too surprising.
[4290.84 --> 4291.96]  That would totally make sense to me.
[4292.08 --> 4293.34]  I would check the used market.
[4293.46 --> 4298.14]  That kind of collusion is technically illegal in basically every developed country around the world.
[4298.20 --> 4299.80]  But absolutely happens.
[4299.86 --> 4301.22]  But absolutely happens.
[4301.22 --> 4316.00]  I would say that it's possible that, you know, given the Netherlands is a relatively small market, it's possible that the allocations of GPUs just weren't as high in that region.
[4316.00 --> 4320.78]  So there's not as much overstock pressure on pricing, just not driving it down.
[4320.78 --> 4329.98]  I would say that if I was trying to protect the profits in my region, I would be doing my utmost to keep additional stock from flooding in.
[4330.44 --> 4335.98]  It's also possible that there's not a huge, I don't know, I'm just guessing, it's possible there's not a huge mining community there.
[4336.76 --> 4337.80]  Yeah, I was wondering about that too.
[4337.82 --> 4343.98]  Maybe the secondary market isn't being flooded with GPUs right now like it is in other regions like China and the US.
[4343.98 --> 4350.70]  And so, again, that's another potential source of pressure on pricing that might not exist there.
[4350.98 --> 4354.76]  And those are the main reasons that I can think of.
[4355.44 --> 4356.32]  There's another one.
[4356.46 --> 4359.74]  Hey, Linus, patiently waiting for party shirts to come back and stock smiley face.
[4359.86 --> 4366.64]  Having recently switched to the ASUS PG42UQ, any complaints or issues like image ghosting?
[4367.20 --> 4370.02]  Are they Windows Snap productivity friendly?
[4370.80 --> 4371.14]  Thanks.
[4372.32 --> 4372.58]  All right.
[4372.58 --> 4373.66]  Well, two parts of that.
[4373.66 --> 4374.96]  One is ghosting.
[4375.12 --> 4375.80]  Heck no.
[4376.16 --> 4378.12]  It's a really nice display.
[4378.26 --> 4379.48]  Really liking it so far.
[4380.04 --> 4383.40]  As for AeroSnap, or what is it called now?
[4383.46 --> 4384.12]  Windows Snap.
[4384.64 --> 4385.34]  AeroSnap's cooler.
[4385.34 --> 4385.56]  Friendly.
[4386.22 --> 4388.14]  I mean, it's an OLED.
[4388.78 --> 4395.96]  I haven't owned it long enough to tell you with certainty that it will not burn in in any way along those lines.
[4398.88 --> 4399.96]  Hopefully it won't.
[4400.98 --> 4401.34]  Yeah, really.
[4401.34 --> 4404.90]  But I mean, yeah, I don't know what to tell you.
[4404.90 --> 4416.40]  If I had to buy it and I really had the longevity of the product as a central concern in my purchase decision, it would give me pause.
[4417.12 --> 4418.16]  I'll say that much.
[4418.16 --> 4427.22]  Linus, did you notice any significant spikes on either the store or your own traffic on YouTube with the MKBHD collab?
[4427.22 --> 4432.70]  Also, is there anything else you are acquiring for the lab that you are uber excited about?
[4433.48 --> 4434.68]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[4434.80 --> 4436.20]  I mean, first of all, yeah, of course.
[4436.40 --> 4442.84]  There was definitely an increase in traffic to the store from the Marques video.
[4442.84 --> 4451.48]  I don't know that it was like, you know, it wasn't like a giant spike like we saw when Project Farms review went out.
[4451.62 --> 4454.96]  But I think that it's also a really different type of media.
[4455.44 --> 4455.96]  For sure.
[4456.10 --> 4459.42]  Like Project Farms video was hyper focused.
[4459.42 --> 4465.72]  And, you know, it's people watch a video like that when their purchase intent is like here.
[4465.92 --> 4467.54]  They are buying a screwdriver.
[4467.94 --> 4468.68]  They are shopping.
[4469.38 --> 4475.66]  Whereas someone watching Marques build a computer, that person might not buy a screwdriver for six months.
[4476.00 --> 4477.30]  And they might go, I need a screwdriver.
[4477.50 --> 4478.44]  Oh, yeah, I saw that one.
[4478.92 --> 4489.00]  That type of situation is more like you're trying to get it in the mind space of these people so that when they do buy one, they would think about it.
[4489.24 --> 4497.14]  Instead of the Project Farms one where it's like they're probably going to buy one and they might do it now considering they're watching that video.
[4497.14 --> 4499.56]  Yeah, I mean, here, it's the classic.
[4499.74 --> 4500.28]  It's the classic.
[4500.44 --> 4501.32]  It's the sales funnel.
[4501.52 --> 4504.90]  Okay, this is like business basics right here.
[4505.24 --> 4506.10]  Let's bring this up.
[4506.64 --> 4507.14]  Yeah, here we go.
[4507.34 --> 4507.52]  What is happening?
[4507.78 --> 4509.02]  I think pizza's arriving.
[4509.16 --> 4509.88]  Hey, thanks, Egg Prime.
[4510.52 --> 4511.40]  Why is there pizza?
[4511.56 --> 4513.42]  Why are you still here?
[4513.50 --> 4513.88]  What a guy.
[4514.52 --> 4515.52]  I went to Costco.
[4515.82 --> 4516.74]  You went to Costco.
[4516.84 --> 4517.88]  This is Costco pizza?
[4518.60 --> 4519.58]  Oh, wow.
[4519.74 --> 4520.02]  Thanks.
[4520.14 --> 4521.26]  Thanks for the pizza, man.
[4522.08 --> 4524.04]  I'm not going to say no.
[4524.04 --> 4528.48]  Man, and you've improved the beauty of the WAN show like tenfold.
[4530.94 --> 4531.34]  Okay.
[4531.66 --> 4532.68]  Are you having a pizza?
[4533.60 --> 4534.66]  Oh, no.
[4534.82 --> 4535.74]  He's thinking about it.
[4535.98 --> 4536.62]  He's not doing it.
[4536.72 --> 4538.12]  Okay, well, I'll have two pizzas then.
[4538.58 --> 4539.30]  I'm going to have his.
[4540.02 --> 4540.76]  Thank you.
[4540.86 --> 4541.34]  That works.
[4541.50 --> 4541.68]  Yeah.
[4543.00 --> 4548.68]  There was another part of that too, which was, is there anything else you're acquiring for the lab that you're uber excited about?
[4548.98 --> 4549.68]  And he's eating.
[4549.68 --> 4553.14]  Okay, well.
[4554.06 --> 4555.74]  I can do a different one.
[4555.86 --> 4556.66]  We can come back to that.
[4556.76 --> 4557.46]  Can you think of anything?
[4562.10 --> 4563.18]  Acquiring for the lab.
[4563.28 --> 4564.24]  So it would have to be like.
[4564.32 --> 4564.82]  Or developing.
[4565.12 --> 4566.00]  I think it doesn't really matter.
[4566.34 --> 4567.66]  Developing for sure.
[4568.12 --> 4568.36]  Yeah.
[4568.40 --> 4569.28]  Let's talk about some stuff.
[4569.52 --> 4575.66]  We've talked about this on the show before, but we have a machine learning computer vision developer coming on staff, which.
[4575.66 --> 4586.34]  This might sound kind of lame, but one of the reasons why I'm really excited about that is because one of our other developers who's been spending a lot of time doing that and is good at that and has experience in that.
[4586.76 --> 4589.94]  We'll be able to spend more time working on the mobile testing stuff.
[4590.08 --> 4590.30]  Yeah.
[4590.30 --> 4608.08]  So here's something really cool that is right in line with that is we are going to be getting our hands not only on an anechoic chamber for like noise isolation, but we're going to be getting an RF chamber that will eliminate RF bounces.
[4608.08 --> 4614.36]  And what that will allow us to do is objectively determine band by band.
[4614.48 --> 4621.76]  So we'll be able to tell you carrier by carrier which phones have the best reception, which is something that is otherwise.
[4622.88 --> 4629.84]  I mean, I think everyone's basically given up on even trying to talk about reception of cell phones and reviews.
[4630.08 --> 4635.22]  Yeah, because unless you have accounts with every carrier in every major city.
[4635.22 --> 4640.44]  Well, what do you even I'd even have that conversation, right?
[4640.48 --> 4641.46]  Like how do you even test it?
[4641.58 --> 4643.10]  Then there's so many real world variables.
[4643.34 --> 4648.58]  But what we'll be able to do is we'll be able to set up our own and turns out you are allowed to do this.
[4649.02 --> 4656.88]  We'll be able to set up our own access points and we will be able to run them at whatever in whatever bands we want.
[4657.36 --> 4657.94]  Yeah, I know.
[4658.04 --> 4658.24]  Right.
[4658.98 --> 4660.52]  No, we just inside the chamber.
[4660.62 --> 4660.80]  Yes.
[4660.92 --> 4661.24]  Okay.
[4661.54 --> 4662.28]  Yeah, I know.
[4662.36 --> 4662.78]  I know.
[4662.86 --> 4663.32]  I know.
[4663.52 --> 4663.92]  I know.
[4663.92 --> 4665.66]  But I'm still kind of surprised.
[4665.88 --> 4666.24]  But sure.
[4666.30 --> 4666.72]  Sounds good.
[4666.80 --> 4668.68]  Yeah, it turns out we are allowed to do that.
[4668.94 --> 4676.02]  And so we will be able to tell you guys objectively which phones have the best RF reception.
[4676.28 --> 4676.48]  Cool.
[4676.76 --> 4676.94]  Sweet.
[4677.02 --> 4677.26]  Yeah.
[4677.36 --> 4678.18]  Isn't that awesome?
[4678.80 --> 4685.14]  We also apparently already have on order slash all the materials and we're going to build it.
[4685.18 --> 4685.76]  I can't remember.
[4685.76 --> 4690.24]  But we're working on like an immersion tank so that we can.
[4690.44 --> 4691.66]  It's like a water column.
[4691.84 --> 4697.64]  And so we'll be able to immerse devices for their rated depth for their rated amount of time and see if they survive.
[4700.58 --> 4701.38]  Yeah, that's cool.
[4701.38 --> 4704.70]  I just I'm happy the dev team is expanding.
[4705.00 --> 4716.06]  There's also the back end developer that, you know, relatively actually quite high end position where they're working before and had a vacation planned.
[4716.06 --> 4719.50]  So there's a bunch of time buffer there before they were able to join.
[4719.60 --> 4720.72]  They're joining soon as well.
[4720.88 --> 4722.92]  So work on the website is going to start.
[4724.06 --> 4725.14]  So, yeah, I don't know.
[4725.26 --> 4725.96]  That stuff's exciting.
[4726.36 --> 4726.90]  Well, you too.
[4726.90 --> 4730.04]  I'm going to move on to the next question, which I can talk about.
[4730.14 --> 4731.34]  I'm sure you'll have input as well, though.
[4732.00 --> 4733.88]  Do you this is from Joseph L.
[4734.26 --> 4740.54]  Do you see cloud computing eventually phasing out the need for powerful personal computers, especially with rising costs of new hardware?
[4741.00 --> 4744.00]  My AI professor thinks it's going to happen real soon.
[4744.82 --> 4746.30]  I don't.
[4746.32 --> 4753.40]  I don't think it's going to happen real soon for the same reason that we when we were just talking with the Logitech G cloud.
[4753.40 --> 4756.38]  And it was like, oh, what do you think about this?
[4756.44 --> 4757.66]  Having ease him and stuff.
[4757.74 --> 4761.88]  Yeah, there's like power outages and service availability issues.
[4762.38 --> 4764.56]  I was just in America for four days.
[4764.82 --> 4766.08]  Your guys's Internet sucks.
[4766.60 --> 4769.68]  So I wouldn't necessarily want to be at least where I was.
[4769.72 --> 4770.26]  It sure did.
[4770.52 --> 4770.94]  Sick burn.
[4770.94 --> 4782.62]  So I wouldn't necessarily want to be on a computer that at my current job and at very likely many of yours, being consistently connected is required.
[4783.14 --> 4791.04]  Like I can't if there's if there's a Internet problem, if there's an Internet outage, my computer can't just stop working.
[4791.04 --> 4797.84]  Like, yeah, I might be limited in what I can do because I don't have the Internet, but it shouldn't just like end everything.
[4797.84 --> 4812.96]  And taking a computer that can that is powerful person, you know, powerful personal computers, what it said, taking that and hotspotting it and limiting what you necessarily maybe maybe don't listen to streaming music while you're working for that amount of time or something.
[4812.96 --> 4816.76]  But you can still function because a lot of it's happening locally is great.
[4816.88 --> 4818.98]  And with cloud computing, that's not so much of a thing.
[4819.16 --> 4829.54]  Yeah. And I mean, there's going to be I feel like we're headed towards a an increase in awareness of the fact that you just you nothing is permanent anymore.
[4829.54 --> 4836.60]  Very recently, Project Cars 2, in fact, it might have been today, Project Cars 2 got delisted from Steam.
[4836.98 --> 4843.80]  And the reason for that is not that they don't want to sell the game anymore or not that Steam is just tired of having it on their servers.
[4843.80 --> 4848.30]  It's that the licenses for the cars in the game have expired.
[4848.30 --> 4861.76]  And I guess it's not selling well enough to justify renewing it and the or for the developer to go in and tweak all the names and tweak the appearances a little bit and like kind of remove those those assets.
[4861.76 --> 4866.28]  And so now it's just gone unless you own it already.
[4866.28 --> 4875.80]  And there's no way to acquire it anymore because it cannot be properly licensed for acquisition because there are no physical copies.
[4875.80 --> 4878.52]  So you can't buy it secondhand anymore.
[4878.52 --> 4892.28]  And I think, you know, if you think about like like a workstation where your hardware itself is a subscription service, you are at the mercy of forces that you cannot control.
[4892.28 --> 4898.68]  And in the case of most users do not fully understand to make sure that you have the tools you need to do your job.
[4898.84 --> 4899.12]  I mean.
[4901.60 --> 4905.60]  And especially with OK, yes, at the high end, it's gotten ridiculous.
[4905.60 --> 4910.60]  But with the affordability of personal hardware at the low to mid range.
[4911.64 --> 4913.00]  That's what you're competing against.
[4913.10 --> 4915.70]  That's exactly the problem with the Logitech G cloud or whatever.
[4915.92 --> 4919.92]  You're going to have to make a cloud working station.
[4920.68 --> 4925.68]  That is so much cheaper than just having your own computer that it becomes worth it.
[4925.74 --> 4928.66]  But having your own computer to a system is so cheap.
[4928.78 --> 4929.04]  Yeah.
[4929.64 --> 4930.24]  So it's tough.
[4930.34 --> 4932.88]  So these lines are going to have a hard time crossing.
[4934.28 --> 4934.92]  I don't know.
[4934.92 --> 4938.08]  I don't personally think your AI professor is correct.
[4938.46 --> 4940.38]  But now I don't know.
[4940.60 --> 4940.98]  Hold on.
[4944.10 --> 4946.30]  I think there are industries and there are spaces.
[4946.84 --> 4949.84]  Oh, it's going to be a thing where that will happen faster.
[4949.94 --> 4950.46]  It's already a thing.
[4951.10 --> 4958.48]  Like, I don't think once we could get it down to like one frame of latency and if we could get the quality a bit better.
[4958.48 --> 4964.10]  I don't see any reason why like a video editing workstation couldn't be cloud based.
[4965.36 --> 4967.14]  They don't know what to deal with updating stuff.
[4967.54 --> 4969.50]  So another development station.
[4969.70 --> 4971.96]  No, because then if your internet goes out.
[4972.84 --> 4981.64]  Another argument I'd throw out there is I was working on a laptop this week and I it was kept in very nice condition.
[4981.64 --> 4984.46]  Like the person who owned it very clearly cared about it.
[4984.86 --> 4987.62]  So I didn't actually realize how old it was.
[4989.00 --> 4991.64]  There was a there was a little Windows.
[4992.78 --> 4993.24]  What was it?
[4994.22 --> 4996.08]  Windows 7 or Windows 8 sticker on it.
[4996.16 --> 4997.92]  It had a 4000 series Intel processor.
[4997.92 --> 5000.54]  I didn't even notice because I wasn't gaming on it.
[5001.56 --> 5005.00]  All I did was like document browsing, internet browsing, stuff like that.
[5005.20 --> 5006.92]  And it was completely fine.
[5007.82 --> 5009.36]  You know how much that laptop would cost?
[5010.02 --> 5011.02]  Like nothing.
[5011.60 --> 5011.72]  Yeah.
[5011.92 --> 5015.62]  You can get laptops on eBay for literally like 60 to 70 dollars.
[5015.84 --> 5016.86]  And you know what?
[5016.88 --> 5018.74]  The battery life probably not great anymore.
[5019.18 --> 5024.18]  But if all you need to do, we actually have a video coming up on Chrome OS Flex.
[5024.18 --> 5038.00]  And so we talk about like how how tough it is to justify a brand new Chromebook when you can buy an ancient ThinkPad, put Chrome OS Flex on it and let's go.
[5038.44 --> 5038.50]  Yeah.
[5038.86 --> 5039.00]  Yeah.
[5039.10 --> 5039.30]  Right.
[5039.54 --> 5041.18]  I don't know if there's news about that.
[5041.26 --> 5041.80]  Oh, there is.
[5042.04 --> 5042.90]  There is news about this.
[5043.16 --> 5043.86]  The framework thing.
[5044.40 --> 5044.66]  Yeah.
[5044.74 --> 5045.08]  Cool.
[5045.16 --> 5045.40]  Right.
[5045.54 --> 5045.70]  Yeah.
[5045.70 --> 5046.64]  It's interesting.
[5046.82 --> 5051.96]  Not that it would be easy to justify buying a framework laptop with Chrome OS now that you have Chrome OS Flex.
[5051.96 --> 5054.18]  Well, we'll get into that in a little bit more detail later.
[5054.32 --> 5056.16]  But for now, I wanted to show you guys the sales funnel.
[5056.26 --> 5057.10]  This is what I was talking about.
[5057.58 --> 5061.14]  So I feel like Marquez's video is up here.
[5061.68 --> 5064.00]  Awareness of a company and or its offerings.
[5065.26 --> 5068.06]  Maybe somewhere in interest in the company and its offerings.
[5068.40 --> 5070.26]  Whereas Project Pharma is down here.
[5070.86 --> 5074.04]  Evaluation of whether the company's offerings satisfy one's needs.
[5074.72 --> 5078.48]  And then, you know, this is really, you know, at the product page level.
[5078.48 --> 5083.06]  So when you're marketing, you have to decide what you're targeting.
[5083.40 --> 5085.86]  And your approach is really different depending on what it is.
[5085.92 --> 5091.28]  I'm expecting the Marquez video to result in a very slow burn of sales.
[5091.64 --> 5093.08]  I'll say now.
[5093.36 --> 5097.50]  We know we have not gotten an ROI on it at this point in time.
[5097.58 --> 5102.34]  But that doesn't mean that, like, I'm mad or that I think it was bad or anything like that.
[5102.40 --> 5105.04]  I think it just is a different.
[5105.26 --> 5107.20]  It had a different goal from the outset.
[5107.20 --> 5110.08]  So you have to adjust your expectations accordingly.
[5110.28 --> 5111.94]  Like the backup pop-up.
[5112.30 --> 5113.66]  We lost a ton of money.
[5113.88 --> 5114.16]  Oh, yeah.
[5114.68 --> 5115.76]  But that wasn't the point.
[5115.84 --> 5116.80]  The point wasn't to make money.
[5116.88 --> 5121.42]  The point was to get enough people there that we could get real user reviews up on the site.
[5121.88 --> 5124.66]  So that we could launch sales for pre-orders.
[5125.60 --> 5126.62]  Excuse me, back orders.
[5126.86 --> 5127.62]  That's the distinction.
[5127.88 --> 5129.40]  Once we had sold them, they're now back orders.
[5130.14 --> 5134.32]  So that we could take back orders for the rest of the inventory that we had coming in.
[5134.32 --> 5140.40]  So, um, Bell, are we able to come full circle back around to our Linus Tech Tips on Espanola?
[5140.54 --> 5141.94]  Do you think you have the audio figured out?
[5143.18 --> 5144.52]  I don't know what's wrong.
[5144.70 --> 5146.86]  So maybe it'll work this time.
[5147.10 --> 5150.24]  I've checked and rechecked everything, and it, in theory, should work.
[5150.36 --> 5150.64]  Okay.
[5150.72 --> 5152.74]  Well, why don't we give it another shot here?
[5153.30 --> 5155.86]  And, uh, we'll see what happens.
[5156.32 --> 5158.32]  Bye.
[5158.32 --> 5158.64]  Bye.
[5164.32 --> 5170.66]  Nope.
[5171.44 --> 5172.04]  All right.
[5172.80 --> 5173.38]  Bone time?
[5173.58 --> 5174.58]  Well, that's a little frustrating.
[5174.72 --> 5175.62]  Yeah, let's just do that.
[5175.96 --> 5179.46]  Unfortunately, you're not going to get 100% of the experience through the phone.
[5180.32 --> 5180.86]  You're really not.
[5181.00 --> 5184.40]  Part of the experience is visual, which I'll talk about afterwards.
[5184.60 --> 5184.84]  No, no.
[5184.88 --> 5188.00]  I'm going to play this, and I'm going to try and time it so that they're going at the same time.
[5188.04 --> 5188.30]  Okay, okay.
[5188.40 --> 5188.84]  So that's good.
[5188.84 --> 5189.04]  So we'll try.
[5189.58 --> 5190.18]  We'll try.
[5190.28 --> 5192.84]  But then also, obviously, like, sound quality problems, stuff like that.
[5192.84 --> 5194.06]  I know, I know.
[5194.22 --> 5195.38]  We're just going to have to do our best with it.
[5195.38 --> 5196.26]  But just keep that in mind.
[5196.60 --> 5196.84]  Yep.
[5198.10 --> 5198.94]  So weird.
[5199.94 --> 5200.74]  So weird.
[5202.98 --> 5203.30]  Okay.
[5203.56 --> 5203.86]  Ready?
[5205.18 --> 5205.80]  Here we go.
[5207.38 --> 5207.86]  Hold up.
[5208.64 --> 5209.32]  Line of screen.
[5209.64 --> 5209.84]  Okay.
[5209.92 --> 5210.68]  We're going to try.
[5210.78 --> 5211.16]  We're going to try.
[5211.26 --> 5211.72]  We're going to try.
[5211.84 --> 5212.00]  Okay?
[5212.48 --> 5212.88]  We're trying.
[5213.04 --> 5213.32]  We're trying.
[5213.72 --> 5213.94]  Okay.
[5215.38 --> 5217.74]  You are as good as dead.
[5217.74 --> 5220.20]  An Apple Watchul trae y un iPhone 14.
[5220.46 --> 5221.36]  Estas casi muerto.
[5222.84 --> 5251.26]  So you guys, uh, you guys got to see it kind of go through all the different stages.
[5251.26 --> 5252.96]  and
[5252.96 --> 5255.62]  I mean
[5255.62 --> 5257.50]  to be clear I don't speak Spanish
[5257.50 --> 5259.82]  but we do have someone on the team
[5259.82 --> 5261.48]  who does and
[5261.48 --> 5263.22]  her evaluation
[5263.22 --> 5265.80]  of both the translation
[5265.80 --> 5267.80]  from the English transcript
[5267.80 --> 5269.92]  to the Spanish transcript as well
[5269.92 --> 5270.74]  as the
[5270.74 --> 5273.08]  spoken version of it
[5273.08 --> 5275.66]  was that it was pretty
[5275.66 --> 5277.48]  darn good was
[5277.48 --> 5278.32]  what she said
[5278.32 --> 5281.70]  people will be darn disappointed when
[5281.70 --> 5283.80]  they realize Linus speaks zero
[5283.80 --> 5284.38]  Spanish
[5284.38 --> 5287.82]  people are saying yeah sounds a little funny
[5287.82 --> 5288.98]  but understandable
[5288.98 --> 5291.92]  you could still hear the editor's voice in the last
[5291.92 --> 5293.76]  one it's because
[5293.76 --> 5295.84]  he doesn't speak Spanish at all that was just
[5295.84 --> 5296.22]  Ed
[5296.22 --> 5299.70]  using his voice for the pickup
[5299.70 --> 5301.18]  we would use a different trainer
[5301.18 --> 5303.22]  I think yeah
[5303.22 --> 5305.56]  it's cool though right
[5305.56 --> 5306.96]  it's sweet that's really cool
[5306.96 --> 5308.50]  yeah I'm
[5308.50 --> 5311.18]  I'm pretty
[5311.18 --> 5313.08]  pretty shocked
[5313.08 --> 5315.92]  the browser tab was not muted
[5315.92 --> 5317.14]  because OBS was seeing
[5317.14 --> 5319.60]  yeah I had I was seeing levels on the display
[5319.60 --> 5321.66]  like I actually I can't explain it
[5321.66 --> 5323.52]  we have something set oddly in OBS
[5323.52 --> 5323.88]  yeah
[5323.88 --> 5324.84]  bye
[5324.84 --> 5326.16]  see you later thanks for the pizza
[5326.16 --> 5326.70]  Prime
[5326.70 --> 5328.60]  all right
[5328.60 --> 5330.84]  do we have another topic we wanted to move into
[5330.84 --> 5332.48]  we sure do we got a few of them
[5332.48 --> 5336.24]  we should talk about the big change in
[5336.24 --> 5337.42]  oh I don't know
[5337.42 --> 5338.64]  you know what no you pick one
[5338.64 --> 5339.22]  because I'm
[5339.22 --> 5342.96]  oh man what a bad week for Twitch
[5342.96 --> 5344.36]  there's a lot of things going on
[5344.36 --> 5345.04]  why don't we talk about Twitch
[5345.04 --> 5346.26]  you want to walk us through a Twitch thing
[5346.26 --> 5346.96]  sure
[5346.96 --> 5349.96]  I actually didn't know the thing that's in the dock was happening
[5349.96 --> 5352.92]  I saw this when I came in today
[5352.92 --> 5355.24]  there's a lot happening with Twitch right now
[5355.24 --> 5359.66]  but this thing is that Twitch announces revenue splitting changes
[5359.66 --> 5362.24]  and apparently no one's happy
[5362.24 --> 5364.54]  on Wednesday the 21st
[5364.54 --> 5367.30]  Twitch started notifying some streamers about incoming changes
[5367.30 --> 5369.94]  or upcoming changes to their user agreements
[5369.94 --> 5375.96]  Twitch uses a baseline revenue share of 50-50 on net revenue from subscriptions
[5375.96 --> 5378.70]  I was just going to say this but it's in the notes
[5378.70 --> 5379.66]  so I'll just read it from the notes
[5379.66 --> 5383.58]  behind the scenes Twitch also offered agreements with premium subscription terms
[5383.58 --> 5385.32]  to select larger streamers
[5385.32 --> 5387.60]  a lot of larger streamers I'm inserting this bit
[5387.60 --> 5390.24]  we're on 70-30 for a long time
[5390.24 --> 5391.12]  that's not a new thing
[5391.12 --> 5392.10]  and that's been known
[5392.10 --> 5394.06]  that's been relatively publicly known
[5394.06 --> 5396.12]  because of leaks for many years
[5396.12 --> 5401.74]  these premium subscription terms are common knowledge within the streamer community
[5401.74 --> 5403.68]  but there's no framework in place to determine
[5403.68 --> 5405.90]  which streamers would be offered these premium terms
[5405.90 --> 5407.66]  or when to offer them
[5407.66 --> 5408.76]  that is 100% true
[5408.76 --> 5411.08]  the decision was made over a year ago
[5411.08 --> 5413.88]  to stop offering these premium terms
[5413.88 --> 5415.22]  do we have premium terms?
[5415.38 --> 5415.90]  did we ever?
[5415.90 --> 5416.88]  for floatplane?
[5417.18 --> 5417.78]  no for Twitch
[5417.78 --> 5421.56]  obviously we get the money from floatplane
[5421.56 --> 5423.92]  I don't think we did
[5423.92 --> 5424.50]  okay
[5424.50 --> 5425.32]  yeah I just wasn't sure
[5425.32 --> 5426.24]  I have no idea though
[5426.24 --> 5429.16]  all I really cared about the contract back in the day was like
[5429.16 --> 5430.94]  what does it not let us do?
[5432.00 --> 5432.88]  which wasn't much
[5432.88 --> 5433.56]  so it was like cool
[5433.56 --> 5436.68]  decision was made over a year ago
[5436.68 --> 5438.00]  to stop offering these premium terms
[5438.00 --> 5439.66]  Twitch felt they were not transparent
[5439.66 --> 5441.12]  or consistent in awarding them
[5441.12 --> 5442.24]  that's probably true
[5442.24 --> 5444.94]  streamers already with these terms will keep them
[5444.94 --> 5445.78]  but
[5445.78 --> 5447.80]  70-30 split
[5447.80 --> 5450.10]  for the first 100k
[5450.10 --> 5452.34]  and a 50-50 split
[5452.34 --> 5453.82]  for all revenue generated
[5453.82 --> 5455.14]  after 100k
[5455.14 --> 5456.72]  hmm
[5456.72 --> 5457.46]  hmm
[5457.46 --> 5458.14]  oh
[5458.14 --> 5458.90]  hmm
[5458.90 --> 5461.40]  seems like streaming is expensive
[5461.40 --> 5465.20]  and Amazon wants Twitch to actually make money for once
[5465.20 --> 5466.80]  and that's gonna be hard
[5466.80 --> 5467.54]  not gonna work
[5467.54 --> 5468.36]  hmm
[5468.36 --> 5469.56]  interesting
[5469.56 --> 5470.82]  Twitch says
[5470.82 --> 5472.02]  90%
[5472.02 --> 5474.64]  roughly 90% of streamers with premium terms
[5474.64 --> 5475.82]  are unaffected
[5475.82 --> 5476.34]  because
[5476.34 --> 5477.12]  you know
[5477.12 --> 5478.34]  they don't make over 100k
[5478.34 --> 5482.08]  for the 10% recent bump in advertising revenue share
[5482.08 --> 5483.42]  up from 55%
[5483.42 --> 5484.38]  for?
[5484.60 --> 5484.74]  what?
[5485.02 --> 5485.32]  up to
[5485.32 --> 5487.14]  for the 10%
[5487.14 --> 5487.90]  okay I get it
[5487.90 --> 5488.16]  I get it
[5488.16 --> 5488.56]  I read it wrong
[5488.56 --> 5489.94]  for the 10% remaining
[5489.94 --> 5491.08]  after that 90%
[5491.08 --> 5492.32]  the recent
[5492.32 --> 5495.74]  a recent revenue bump in advertising revenue share
[5495.74 --> 5497.34]  up to 55%
[5497.34 --> 5498.64]  is a great way
[5498.64 --> 5500.62]  for these larger streamers to make up most
[5500.62 --> 5501.72]  if not all of that revenue
[5501.72 --> 5502.78]  great way
[5502.78 --> 5503.30]  that's
[5503.30 --> 5504.48]  that's inserted from Twitch
[5504.48 --> 5505.54]  just to be very clear
[5505.54 --> 5506.82]  because no one likes ads
[5506.82 --> 5509.28]  more than 22,000 streamers requested
[5509.28 --> 5510.90]  that all streamers be moved
[5510.90 --> 5512.32]  to the 70-30 split
[5512.32 --> 5514.80]  and pay streamers faster
[5514.80 --> 5517.82]  it sounds like that's probably 22,000 streamers
[5517.82 --> 5519.92]  that didn't already have the 70-30 split
[5519.92 --> 5522.56]  Twitch responded by making the
[5522.56 --> 5523.42]  in quotes
[5523.42 --> 5525.86]  largest change to payouts in years
[5525.86 --> 5528.06]  and they lowered the payment threshold
[5528.06 --> 5529.40]  from $100 to $50
[5529.40 --> 5532.28]  that is actually really intense
[5532.28 --> 5535.80]  because there's going to be a really large amount of people
[5535.80 --> 5538.14]  that stream in order to make 50 bucks
[5538.14 --> 5539.52]  for tax reasons
[5539.52 --> 5543.52]  that I'm not going to go into in further detail
[5543.52 --> 5544.08]  really?
[5544.36 --> 5545.60]  because I'm super curious
[5545.60 --> 5548.06]  is it something you really can't talk about?
[5548.38 --> 5549.82]  if you make money off it
[5549.82 --> 5551.30]  it could technically be a business
[5551.30 --> 5552.94]  things that show up on it
[5552.94 --> 5554.84]  could be used against taxes
[5554.84 --> 5556.26]  oh
[5556.26 --> 5558.76]  so as long as you get some kind of payout
[5558.76 --> 5560.06]  you have to get some kind of payout
[5560.06 --> 5561.26]  that payout was $100
[5561.26 --> 5562.38]  now it's $50
[5562.38 --> 5563.50]  it's way easier to do
[5563.50 --> 5566.52]  and if you want to be shady about it
[5566.52 --> 5568.74]  you can just pay the $50 in yourself
[5568.74 --> 5574.82]  you're going to get 50% of it back
[5574.82 --> 5576.74]  so it's $25
[5576.74 --> 5581.02]  to be a business
[5581.02 --> 5583.56]  so your gaming computer
[5583.56 --> 5584.52]  yes
[5584.52 --> 5585.38]  business expense
[5585.38 --> 5586.42]  whatever you show on stream
[5586.42 --> 5589.60]  what if you do more expensive things?
[5589.60 --> 5591.10]  we are not accountants
[5591.10 --> 5592.76]  we are not lawyers
[5592.76 --> 5595.12]  I'm not saying you should do this
[5595.12 --> 5595.78]  we're not
[5595.78 --> 5596.98]  what I'm saying is that
[5596.98 --> 5598.54]  it's been done by people
[5598.54 --> 5599.64]  it has not been done by me
[5599.64 --> 5600.10]  allegedly
[5600.10 --> 5602.60]  allegedly it's been done by people
[5602.60 --> 5604.80]  it's like super sketch
[5604.80 --> 5607.66]  but I knew it was being done
[5607.66 --> 5608.32]  at $100
[5608.32 --> 5609.88]  and I know it's going to be
[5609.88 --> 5611.76]  a whole heck of a lot easier to do at $50
[5611.76 --> 5612.94]  that's all
[5612.94 --> 5614.80]  okay
[5614.80 --> 5616.30]  Twitch justified
[5616.30 --> 5617.56]  not increasing
[5617.56 --> 5618.68]  to $70.30
[5618.68 --> 5619.98]  by stating that
[5619.98 --> 5620.62]  a streamer with
[5620.62 --> 5621.78]  100 concurrent viewers
[5621.78 --> 5623.44]  who streams for 200 hours a month
[5623.44 --> 5624.34]  costs the company
[5624.34 --> 5625.30]  $1,000
[5625.30 --> 5626.92]  over those 200 hours
[5626.92 --> 5627.46]  yeah
[5627.46 --> 5628.50]  and they're the ones
[5628.50 --> 5629.70]  that make all the tech
[5629.70 --> 5630.86]  and host the servers
[5630.86 --> 5632.70]  streaming is expensive man
[5632.70 --> 5633.42]  okay
[5633.42 --> 5635.60]  as
[5635.60 --> 5636.08]  hilarious
[5636.08 --> 5637.50]  as part of these changes
[5637.50 --> 5637.86]  Twitch
[5637.86 --> 5639.00]  I'm actually surprised
[5639.00 --> 5640.20]  it's like even that low
[5640.20 --> 5641.48]  to be completely honest
[5641.48 --> 5643.02]  and I think that is because
[5643.02 --> 5644.32]  they make all the tech
[5644.32 --> 5645.32]  and I guarantee that
[5645.32 --> 5646.24]  that does not include
[5646.24 --> 5647.28]  developer time
[5647.28 --> 5648.44]  for maintaining these things
[5648.44 --> 5649.44]  and stuff like that
[5649.44 --> 5650.18]  but anyways
[5650.18 --> 5651.94]  as part of these changes
[5651.94 --> 5653.26]  Twitch is also cracking down
[5653.26 --> 5653.74]  on streams
[5653.74 --> 5654.88]  that promote certain types
[5654.88 --> 5657.94]  of gambling starting October 18th
[5657.94 --> 5659.74]  I think this is cool
[5659.74 --> 5661.52]  I've never liked gambling
[5661.52 --> 5662.58]  my entire life though
[5662.58 --> 5663.56]  I don't
[5663.56 --> 5664.56]  I don't know
[5664.56 --> 5666.32]  slots
[5666.32 --> 5666.80]  roulette
[5666.80 --> 5667.58]  or dice games
[5667.58 --> 5669.06]  that aren't in the
[5669.06 --> 5670.84]  that aren't in the US
[5670.84 --> 5671.74]  or other jurisdictions
[5671.74 --> 5672.90]  that provide sufficient
[5672.90 --> 5674.08]  consumer protection
[5674.08 --> 5674.48]  are banned
[5674.48 --> 5675.98]  okay
[5675.98 --> 5678.04]  prior to this
[5678.04 --> 5678.70]  prominent streamers
[5678.70 --> 5679.72]  were publicly considering
[5679.72 --> 5681.66]  a Twitch blackout
[5681.66 --> 5682.72]  to protest the site's
[5682.72 --> 5683.68]  implicit promotion
[5683.68 --> 5685.08]  of damaging and addictive
[5685.08 --> 5685.90]  gambling behavior
[5685.90 --> 5687.04]  it's pretty intense
[5687.04 --> 5687.94]  there's a lot of it
[5687.94 --> 5689.68]  with that said
[5689.68 --> 5691.14]  sports gambling
[5691.14 --> 5692.14]  not banned
[5692.14 --> 5694.00]  but
[5694.00 --> 5694.62]  yeah
[5694.62 --> 5695.88]  because Twitch and the NFL
[5695.88 --> 5696.46]  are friends
[5696.46 --> 5698.90]  and in
[5698.90 --> 5699.84]  I think
[5699.84 --> 5700.68]  relatively
[5700.68 --> 5701.80]  based on the overall
[5701.80 --> 5702.80]  length of the NFL
[5702.80 --> 5704.60]  the NFL being cool
[5704.60 --> 5705.06]  with gambling
[5705.06 --> 5705.98]  is actually relatively
[5705.98 --> 5706.68]  new as well
[5706.68 --> 5707.90]  but they do seem
[5707.90 --> 5708.54]  to be quite cool
[5708.54 --> 5709.52]  with gambling these days
[5709.52 --> 5711.88]  so that's a thing
[5711.88 --> 5713.40]  poker also remains
[5713.40 --> 5713.98]  unbanned
[5713.98 --> 5715.18]  I think because
[5715.18 --> 5716.16]  to a decent amount
[5716.16 --> 5716.40]  of people
[5716.40 --> 5717.12]  it's seen more
[5717.12 --> 5717.86]  like a sport
[5717.86 --> 5718.76]  than other forms
[5718.76 --> 5719.20]  of gambling
[5719.20 --> 5719.62]  I can see that
[5719.62 --> 5721.86]  which does actually
[5721.86 --> 5722.58]  sort of make sense
[5722.58 --> 5722.84]  to me
[5722.84 --> 5723.42]  it's playing sports
[5723.42 --> 5723.84]  for money
[5723.84 --> 5724.62]  but that's also
[5724.62 --> 5725.04]  gambling
[5725.04 --> 5725.64]  but also
[5725.64 --> 5726.72]  playing the game
[5726.72 --> 5727.28]  it's
[5727.28 --> 5728.56]  I can see
[5728.56 --> 5729.30]  poker I'd see
[5729.30 --> 5730.00]  as kind of a weird
[5730.00 --> 5730.62]  grey area
[5730.62 --> 5730.90]  yeah
[5730.90 --> 5732.34]  where there's at least
[5732.34 --> 5733.56]  a skill component
[5733.56 --> 5734.06]  yeah
[5734.06 --> 5734.84]  like
[5734.84 --> 5736.50]  I'm not knocking
[5736.50 --> 5737.46]  like poker players
[5737.46 --> 5737.94]  like yes
[5737.94 --> 5739.42]  there's a skill component
[5739.42 --> 5740.18]  but you also can't
[5740.18 --> 5740.78]  deny that there's
[5740.78 --> 5741.80]  a chance component
[5741.80 --> 5743.90]  if I try to play
[5743.90 --> 5744.68]  poker against someone
[5744.68 --> 5745.50]  who's super good at it
[5745.50 --> 5746.02]  I'm probably going
[5746.02 --> 5746.52]  to get wrecked
[5746.52 --> 5746.76]  yeah
[5746.76 --> 5747.70]  there's more to it
[5747.70 --> 5748.32]  than just chance
[5748.32 --> 5749.02]  but there is a lot
[5749.02 --> 5749.38]  of chance
[5749.38 --> 5752.18]  discussion question
[5752.18 --> 5753.12]  is this enough
[5753.12 --> 5753.96]  or should streamers
[5753.96 --> 5754.54]  continue to push
[5754.54 --> 5755.52]  for full gambling ban
[5755.52 --> 5756.42]  oh it's just about
[5756.42 --> 5757.04]  the gambling ban
[5757.04 --> 5759.12]  I don't know
[5759.12 --> 5760.16]  I'm not into gambling
[5760.16 --> 5761.14]  but I also have to
[5761.14 --> 5761.74]  understand that
[5761.74 --> 5762.26]  that's a personal
[5762.26 --> 5762.98]  preference thing
[5762.98 --> 5765.76]  I'm not going to
[5765.76 --> 5766.78]  watch gambling content
[5766.78 --> 5767.24]  I'm not going to
[5767.24 --> 5767.74]  get influenced
[5767.74 --> 5768.72]  by gambling content
[5768.72 --> 5769.46]  if Twitch actually
[5769.46 --> 5770.20]  had a meaningful
[5770.20 --> 5771.20]  way to
[5771.20 --> 5772.86]  to keep
[5772.86 --> 5773.68]  minors
[5773.68 --> 5774.84]  off the site
[5774.84 --> 5775.56]  which they don't
[5775.56 --> 5776.44]  because it's as far
[5776.44 --> 5777.08]  as I can tell
[5777.08 --> 5777.88]  like no one does
[5777.88 --> 5778.66]  all kids
[5778.66 --> 5779.30]  watching it
[5779.30 --> 5779.68]  unless you like
[5779.68 --> 5781.44]  take IDs
[5781.44 --> 5782.00]  yeah
[5782.00 --> 5784.32]  unless they
[5784.32 --> 5785.32]  have a way
[5785.32 --> 5785.92]  to do that
[5785.92 --> 5786.78]  I think gambling
[5786.78 --> 5787.70]  has been pretty
[5787.70 --> 5788.96]  clearly set
[5788.96 --> 5789.80]  as an adult
[5789.80 --> 5790.36]  activity
[5790.36 --> 5791.46]  and
[5791.46 --> 5792.22]  I
[5792.22 --> 5793.14]  I don't really
[5793.14 --> 5794.02]  see why we're
[5794.02 --> 5794.84]  drawing a line
[5794.84 --> 5795.28]  between
[5795.28 --> 5795.82]  oh well
[5795.82 --> 5796.74]  this kind of
[5796.74 --> 5797.10]  gambling
[5797.10 --> 5798.16]  this kind
[5798.16 --> 5798.74]  of gambling
[5798.74 --> 5800.62]  when we know
[5800.62 --> 5801.62]  that such a
[5801.62 --> 5802.48]  large
[5802.48 --> 5803.66]  large
[5803.66 --> 5804.84]  percentage
[5804.84 --> 5805.72]  of the Twitch
[5805.72 --> 5806.42]  viewer
[5806.42 --> 5807.24]  community
[5807.24 --> 5807.98]  is
[5807.98 --> 5809.06]  sub
[5809.06 --> 5810.48]  age of majority
[5810.48 --> 5811.76]  so that's my
[5811.76 --> 5812.68]  biggest issue
[5812.68 --> 5813.16]  with it
[5813.16 --> 5814.60]  beyond that
[5814.60 --> 5815.40]  as far as I'm
[5815.40 --> 5815.74]  concerned
[5815.74 --> 5816.24]  you want to
[5816.24 --> 5817.12]  stream yourself
[5817.12 --> 5817.60]  like
[5817.60 --> 5820.34]  I don't
[5820.34 --> 5820.66]  I don't
[5820.66 --> 5821.24]  I don't know
[5821.24 --> 5822.64]  you flip a coin
[5822.64 --> 5823.50]  and if it's
[5823.50 --> 5823.80]  heads
[5823.80 --> 5824.16]  you
[5824.16 --> 5826.46]  shoot a paintball
[5826.46 --> 5827.08]  at your head
[5827.08 --> 5827.62]  and if it's
[5827.62 --> 5827.92]  tails
[5827.92 --> 5828.36]  you shoot a
[5828.36 --> 5828.76]  paintball
[5828.76 --> 5829.34]  at your ass
[5829.34 --> 5829.60]  and you
[5829.60 --> 5830.54]  pay 10 bucks
[5830.54 --> 5831.60]  I don't care
[5831.60 --> 5832.26]  I might watch
[5832.26 --> 5832.40]  that
[5832.40 --> 5834.84]  I would watch
[5834.84 --> 5835.46]  that if it was you
[5835.46 --> 5836.20]  I would 100%
[5836.20 --> 5836.68]  watch that
[5836.68 --> 5837.60]  I would probably
[5837.60 --> 5838.34]  pay the stream
[5838.34 --> 5838.82]  money
[5838.82 --> 5839.58]  I'm just saying
[5839.58 --> 5840.18]  like yeah
[5840.18 --> 5840.86]  and you know
[5840.86 --> 5841.68]  Twitch chat
[5841.68 --> 5843.12]  being all dialed
[5843.12 --> 5843.56]  into Twitch
[5843.56 --> 5843.90]  and stuff
[5843.90 --> 5844.20]  they're like
[5844.20 --> 5844.64]  yeah what about
[5844.64 --> 5845.18]  loot boxes
[5845.18 --> 5845.96]  yeah 100%
[5845.96 --> 5846.14]  yeah
[5846.14 --> 5847.00]  there's actually
[5847.00 --> 5848.32]  this one in
[5848.32 --> 5848.88]  full plane chat
[5848.88 --> 5849.44]  mentioned
[5849.44 --> 5850.56]  ban opening
[5850.56 --> 5851.40]  Pokemon cards
[5851.40 --> 5852.44]  Red Dead Redemption 2
[5852.44 --> 5853.64]  and GTA Online
[5853.64 --> 5854.58]  in GTA Online
[5854.58 --> 5855.16]  if you go to the
[5855.16 --> 5855.82]  casino do you get
[5855.82 --> 5856.08]  banned
[5856.08 --> 5859.20]  in Red Dead Redemption 2
[5859.20 --> 5859.60]  they have
[5859.60 --> 5860.26]  they have poker
[5860.26 --> 5860.82]  I think they also
[5860.82 --> 5861.60]  have other card game
[5861.60 --> 5862.34]  things like do you
[5862.34 --> 5862.86]  get banned if you
[5862.86 --> 5863.78]  play well it's poker
[5863.78 --> 5864.88]  so no but like
[5864.88 --> 5866.84]  you can extrapolate
[5866.84 --> 5867.30]  from there
[5867.30 --> 5870.28]  for me the bigger
[5870.28 --> 5871.34]  conversation is the
[5871.34 --> 5871.84]  revenue split
[5871.84 --> 5872.28]  changes
[5872.28 --> 5872.68]  yes
[5872.68 --> 5873.88]  that is
[5873.88 --> 5874.72]  especially
[5874.72 --> 5876.36]  in light of
[5876.36 --> 5877.20]  how
[5877.20 --> 5878.62]  how aggressively
[5878.62 --> 5879.70]  YouTube has
[5879.70 --> 5880.24]  pursued
[5880.24 --> 5881.88]  I think I remember
[5881.88 --> 5882.82]  saying like back
[5882.82 --> 5883.50]  when YouTube was
[5883.50 --> 5884.22]  like yeah YouTube
[5884.22 --> 5884.72]  gaming
[5884.72 --> 5888.72]  I remember saying
[5888.72 --> 5889.20]  like good luck
[5889.20 --> 5889.96]  with that YouTube
[5889.96 --> 5891.36]  but like
[5891.36 --> 5892.76]  I mean it's been
[5892.76 --> 5893.48]  a long time
[5893.48 --> 5894.08]  yeah
[5894.08 --> 5894.84]  and I feel like
[5894.84 --> 5895.84]  they've only really
[5895.84 --> 5896.62]  been picking up a
[5896.62 --> 5897.16]  ton of steam
[5897.16 --> 5898.14]  within the last
[5898.14 --> 5898.92]  one to two years
[5898.92 --> 5899.80]  but I mean that's
[5899.80 --> 5900.38]  Google right
[5900.38 --> 5900.92]  but they are
[5900.92 --> 5901.72]  picking up steam
[5901.72 --> 5902.62]  long game
[5902.62 --> 5903.22]  long game
[5903.22 --> 5903.84]  long game
[5903.84 --> 5904.50]  I mean I was
[5904.50 --> 5904.96]  big wins
[5904.96 --> 5905.48]  in the game
[5905.48 --> 5906.86]  they're winning
[5906.86 --> 5907.62]  in the way that
[5907.62 --> 5908.22]  Mixer couldn't
[5908.22 --> 5909.82]  when Mixer did
[5909.82 --> 5910.50]  their big move
[5910.50 --> 5911.10]  I remember talking
[5911.10 --> 5911.62]  on Wancho about
[5911.62 --> 5912.14]  how it wasn't
[5912.14 --> 5912.44]  enough
[5912.44 --> 5913.12]  yeah
[5913.12 --> 5913.56]  their move
[5913.56 --> 5914.10]  wasn't enough
[5914.10 --> 5914.82]  they didn't bring
[5914.82 --> 5915.68]  over enough
[5915.68 --> 5916.18]  streamers
[5916.18 --> 5918.22]  and what YouTube
[5918.22 --> 5919.22]  streaming is really
[5919.22 --> 5919.90]  winning at right
[5919.90 --> 5921.28]  now is
[5921.28 --> 5922.64]  sure they're paying
[5922.64 --> 5923.08]  to bring some
[5923.08 --> 5923.62]  streamers over
[5923.62 --> 5924.66]  there's also
[5924.66 --> 5925.38]  streamers just
[5925.38 --> 5926.32]  coming on over
[5926.32 --> 5927.04]  yeah
[5927.04 --> 5928.56]  and not a small
[5928.56 --> 5929.06]  amount of them
[5929.06 --> 5929.90]  and not just
[5929.90 --> 5931.06]  tiny ones that
[5931.06 --> 5931.80]  cost a thousand
[5931.80 --> 5932.64]  dollars a month
[5932.64 --> 5933.04]  yeah
[5933.04 --> 5933.68]  for them to
[5933.68 --> 5934.52]  sustain them
[5934.52 --> 5934.88]  yeah
[5934.88 --> 5935.48]  because there's
[5935.48 --> 5935.92]  an army of
[5935.92 --> 5936.40]  those I'm sure
[5936.40 --> 5937.12]  because they'll
[5937.12 --> 5937.44]  see their
[5937.44 --> 5938.06]  favorite streamer
[5938.06 --> 5938.42]  move over
[5938.42 --> 5938.78]  so they'll
[5938.78 --> 5939.14]  move over
[5939.14 --> 5939.36]  too
[5939.36 --> 5939.88]  which is
[5939.88 --> 5940.16]  that's
[5940.16 --> 5940.46]  completely
[5940.46 --> 5940.80]  fine
[5940.80 --> 5941.92]  but we're
[5941.92 --> 5942.44]  talking like
[5942.44 --> 5942.98]  really big
[5942.98 --> 5943.60]  streamers that
[5943.60 --> 5944.30]  are either
[5944.30 --> 5945.30]  approaching YouTube
[5945.30 --> 5946.60]  and then doing
[5946.60 --> 5947.20]  it for a lower
[5947.20 --> 5947.66]  amount than
[5947.66 --> 5948.24]  YouTube might have
[5948.24 --> 5948.64]  expected
[5948.64 --> 5949.78]  or approaching
[5949.78 --> 5950.46]  YouTube and
[5950.46 --> 5951.46]  doing it for
[5951.46 --> 5951.76]  nothing
[5951.76 --> 5953.02]  maybe a little
[5953.02 --> 5953.48]  bit of seed
[5953.48 --> 5954.02]  money to make
[5954.02 --> 5955.20]  a cool video
[5955.20 --> 5955.80]  where they pick
[5955.80 --> 5956.30]  a purple
[5956.30 --> 5957.56]  they pick a red
[5957.56 --> 5958.24]  object over a
[5958.24 --> 5958.82]  purple object
[5958.82 --> 5959.30]  because that's what
[5959.30 --> 5959.76]  happens every
[5959.76 --> 5960.18]  single time
[5960.18 --> 5961.66]  I can definitely
[5961.66 --> 5962.86]  see YouTube
[5962.86 --> 5963.96]  pushing hard
[5963.96 --> 5965.10]  the Machuski
[5965.10 --> 5966.84]  in Twitch chat
[5966.84 --> 5967.32]  says I heard
[5967.32 --> 5968.34]  Ludwig is working
[5968.34 --> 5972.24]  with YouTube
[5972.24 --> 5975.20]  and BTTV
[5975.20 --> 5976.18]  and 7TV
[5976.18 --> 5976.80]  extensions
[5976.80 --> 5978.92]  that's pretty
[5978.92 --> 5979.42]  interesting
[5979.42 --> 5980.26]  because I mean
[5980.26 --> 5981.46]  there's no
[5981.46 --> 5983.00]  there's no doubt
[5983.00 --> 5983.54]  that YouTube
[5983.54 --> 5984.24]  does not have
[5984.24 --> 5984.90]  feature parody
[5984.90 --> 5985.64]  with Twitch yet
[5985.64 --> 5985.92]  yeah
[5985.92 --> 5988.24]  Ludwig's chat
[5988.24 --> 5988.66]  thing
[5988.66 --> 5989.06]  it's a matter
[5989.06 --> 5989.44]  of time
[5989.44 --> 5990.14]  is really cool
[5990.14 --> 5990.36]  though
[5990.36 --> 5991.28]  like they've
[5991.28 --> 5991.92]  actually put in
[5991.92 --> 5993.48]  put in work
[5993.48 --> 5995.32]  I've looked into
[5995.32 --> 5996.14]  the developer
[5996.14 --> 5996.58]  behind it
[5996.58 --> 5997.10]  he's doing cool
[5997.10 --> 5997.26]  stuff
[5997.26 --> 5997.74]  I finally met
[5997.74 --> 5997.98]  him
[5997.98 --> 5999.36]  oh Ludwig
[5999.36 --> 5999.68]  yeah
[5999.68 --> 6000.36]  yeah he was at
[6000.36 --> 6000.76]  the thing
[6000.76 --> 6001.16]  I'm assuming
[6001.16 --> 6001.70]  yeah
[6001.70 --> 6002.12]  cool
[6002.12 --> 6002.56]  yeah
[6002.56 --> 6003.20]  super cool
[6003.20 --> 6005.62]  he asked me
[6005.62 --> 6006.60]  if after you
[6006.60 --> 6007.22]  get a vasectomy
[6007.22 --> 6008.64]  you can still
[6008.64 --> 6008.92]  come
[6008.92 --> 6011.50]  and so I
[6011.50 --> 6011.98]  explained
[6011.98 --> 6012.66]  that sounds like
[6012.66 --> 6013.18]  a question he
[6013.18 --> 6013.50]  would ask
[6013.50 --> 6014.18]  I explained how
[6014.18 --> 6014.54]  it works
[6014.54 --> 6015.42]  this is why I
[6015.42 --> 6016.18]  like the podcast
[6016.18 --> 6016.78]  yeah
[6016.78 --> 6017.28]  yeah
[6017.28 --> 6018.38]  yep
[6018.38 --> 6021.72]  he's knowledgeable
[6021.72 --> 6022.40]  about a lot of
[6022.40 --> 6022.74]  things
[6022.74 --> 6023.66]  just not that
[6023.66 --> 6024.22]  vasectomy
[6024.22 --> 6024.98]  but now maybe
[6024.98 --> 6025.44]  he is
[6025.44 --> 6025.82]  right
[6025.82 --> 6026.06]  yeah
[6026.06 --> 6026.90]  ever expanding
[6026.90 --> 6027.40]  oh well now
[6027.40 --> 6027.96]  he's an expert
[6027.96 --> 6028.76]  because I actually
[6028.76 --> 6029.90]  I gave him the
[6029.90 --> 6030.44]  full lowdown
[6030.44 --> 6030.72]  yeah
[6030.72 --> 6031.08]  perfect
[6031.08 --> 6031.58]  lowdown
[6031.58 --> 6032.04]  pun intended
[6032.04 --> 6032.52]  did you tell him
[6032.52 --> 6032.94]  about how like
[6032.94 --> 6033.30]  the doctor
[6033.30 --> 6033.88]  recognized you
[6033.88 --> 6034.26]  and everything
[6034.26 --> 6035.38]  no I didn't
[6035.38 --> 6035.84]  talk about that
[6035.84 --> 6036.26]  because he might
[6036.26 --> 6037.04]  need to know that
[6037.04 --> 6039.36]  he doesn't now
[6039.36 --> 6040.20]  yeah I didn't
[6040.20 --> 6041.04]  I actually forgot
[6041.04 --> 6041.54]  about that
[6041.54 --> 6042.08]  that'll be a fun
[6042.08 --> 6042.32]  experience
[6042.32 --> 6043.02]  to be honest with you
[6043.02 --> 6043.76]  probably hear about it
[6043.76 --> 6044.16]  on the yard
[6044.16 --> 6044.44]  yeah
[6044.44 --> 6045.60]  all right
[6045.60 --> 6046.80]  well I don't know
[6046.80 --> 6047.54]  the revenue split
[6047.54 --> 6048.60]  stuff sucks
[6048.60 --> 6049.14]  oh my god
[6049.14 --> 6049.68]  twitch chat
[6049.68 --> 6050.72]  well can you
[6050.72 --> 6051.34]  don't leave us
[6051.34 --> 6051.62]  hanging
[6051.62 --> 6052.56]  yes
[6052.56 --> 6054.88]  carry on
[6054.88 --> 6055.12]  yeah
[6055.12 --> 6056.24]  um
[6056.24 --> 6057.24]  the revenue split
[6057.24 --> 6057.98]  stuff uh
[6057.98 --> 6058.90]  as a creator
[6058.90 --> 6059.82]  having
[6059.82 --> 6062.24]  especially a streamer
[6062.24 --> 6063.00]  a streamer who
[6063.00 --> 6063.94]  hasn't done the
[6063.94 --> 6064.24]  proper
[6064.24 --> 6064.70]  I talked about
[6064.70 --> 6065.10]  this a few
[6065.10 --> 6065.54]  uh
[6065.54 --> 6066.16]  wanchels ago
[6066.16 --> 6066.64]  but a streamer
[6066.64 --> 6067.32]  who hasn't done
[6067.32 --> 6068.18]  the split out
[6068.18 --> 6069.06]  into having a
[6069.06 --> 6069.90]  heavy arm
[6069.90 --> 6070.64]  for VOD
[6070.64 --> 6071.10]  as well
[6071.10 --> 6072.02]  because a lot
[6072.02 --> 6072.42]  of streamers
[6072.42 --> 6072.74]  have been doing
[6072.74 --> 6073.08]  that I think
[6073.08 --> 6073.68]  that's actually
[6073.68 --> 6074.42]  really fascinating
[6074.42 --> 6074.74]  if you want
[6074.74 --> 6075.02]  to look into
[6075.02 --> 6075.42]  that it's very
[6075.42 --> 6075.78]  interesting
[6075.78 --> 6076.72]  um
[6076.72 --> 6077.84]  but streamers
[6077.84 --> 6078.14]  who are
[6078.14 --> 6079.54]  just streamers
[6079.54 --> 6080.12]  they
[6080.12 --> 6080.32]  they
[6080.32 --> 6081.30]  in a lot
[6081.30 --> 6081.56]  of cases
[6081.56 --> 6081.86]  don't even
[6081.86 --> 6082.30]  have a huge
[6082.30 --> 6082.98]  twitter presence
[6082.98 --> 6083.74]  they're just
[6083.74 --> 6084.56]  they're streamers
[6084.56 --> 6085.04]  they're on twitch
[6085.04 --> 6085.38]  that's what
[6085.38 --> 6085.76]  they do
[6085.76 --> 6086.66]  having your
[6086.66 --> 6087.26]  revenue split
[6087.26 --> 6088.00]  changed on you
[6088.00 --> 6089.28]  is very
[6089.28 --> 6090.64]  died
[6090.64 --> 6092.04]  my stream deck
[6092.04 --> 6092.54]  stopped working
[6092.54 --> 6092.98]  but I press
[6092.98 --> 6093.46]  the bleep button
[6093.46 --> 6094.14]  it's very
[6094.14 --> 6094.62]  uncomfortable
[6094.62 --> 6095.36]  with a
[6095.36 --> 6096.12]  f word
[6096.12 --> 6096.48]  in the middle
[6096.48 --> 6096.72]  of there
[6096.72 --> 6096.86]  yeah
[6096.86 --> 6097.90]  like
[6097.90 --> 6098.70]  holy
[6098.70 --> 6099.26]  that's not
[6099.26 --> 6099.56]  cool
[6099.56 --> 6099.92]  well that
[6099.92 --> 6100.46]  that shakes
[6100.46 --> 6101.14]  your trust
[6101.14 --> 6101.68]  absolutely
[6101.68 --> 6102.58]  and that's
[6102.58 --> 6102.80]  going to
[6102.80 --> 6103.26]  inspire you
[6103.26 --> 6103.90]  to reach out
[6103.90 --> 6104.40]  spread out
[6104.40 --> 6104.76]  start doing
[6104.76 --> 6105.12]  other things
[6105.12 --> 6105.52]  these people
[6105.52 --> 6106.40]  are many
[6106.40 --> 6106.94]  people affected
[6106.94 --> 6107.60]  this by this
[6107.60 --> 6108.12]  they're going
[6108.12 --> 6108.36]  to start
[6108.36 --> 6108.78]  looking into
[6108.78 --> 6109.26]  those other
[6109.26 --> 6109.86]  streamers
[6109.86 --> 6110.34]  other creators
[6110.34 --> 6110.60]  that have
[6110.60 --> 6111.28]  started branching
[6111.28 --> 6111.52]  out into
[6111.52 --> 6111.84]  other things
[6111.84 --> 6112.10]  they're going
[6112.10 --> 6112.32]  to start
[6112.32 --> 6112.68]  doing it
[6112.68 --> 6112.94]  the dumb
[6112.94 --> 6113.24]  thing
[6113.24 --> 6114.26]  the dumb
[6114.26 --> 6114.52]  thing
[6114.52 --> 6115.18]  from twitch's
[6115.18 --> 6115.58]  standpoint
[6115.58 --> 6116.76]  is that they
[6116.76 --> 6117.80]  basically took
[6117.80 --> 6118.68]  their most
[6118.68 --> 6120.10]  profitable users
[6120.10 --> 6122.64]  their most
[6122.64 --> 6123.96]  profitable users
[6123.96 --> 6125.66]  and pissed
[6125.66 --> 6126.26]  them off
[6126.26 --> 6126.82]  yep
[6126.82 --> 6128.70]  oh

[6189.22 --> 6189.58]  framework
[6189.58 --> 6190.12]  laptop
[6190.12 --> 6191.08]  the main
[6191.08 --> 6191.86]  board in
[6191.86 --> 6192.38]  the chromebook
[6192.38 --> 6193.10]  edition is
[6193.10 --> 6194.44]  specifically designed
[6194.44 --> 6195.36]  for chrome os
[6195.36 --> 6195.88]  though and there's
[6195.88 --> 6197.02]  no word yet on
[6197.02 --> 6198.20]  windows compatibility
[6198.20 --> 6199.80]  framework chromebooks
[6199.80 --> 6200.26]  will get up to
[6200.26 --> 6201.28]  eight years of
[6201.28 --> 6201.86]  chromebook os
[6201.86 --> 6203.66]  updates but a
[6203.66 --> 6204.50]  main board upgrade
[6204.50 --> 6205.20]  from framework
[6205.20 --> 6206.38]  could extend that
[6206.38 --> 6206.86]  timeline
[6206.86 --> 6207.98]  pre-orders are
[6207.98 --> 6208.72]  available now for
[6208.72 --> 6209.48]  a fully refundable
[6209.48 --> 6210.14]  hundred dollars
[6210.14 --> 6211.38]  full disclosure i
[6211.38 --> 6212.42]  am an investor in
[6212.42 --> 6213.96]  framework uh with
[6213.96 --> 6214.90]  that said i think
[6214.90 --> 6216.28]  you guys uh probably
[6216.28 --> 6217.22]  pretty clearly picked
[6217.22 --> 6217.94]  up on that i think
[6217.94 --> 6218.80]  a thousand dollars for
[6218.80 --> 6219.80]  a chromebook is a
[6219.80 --> 6220.70]  lot of money
[6220.70 --> 6221.98]  regardless of how
[6221.98 --> 6223.18]  repairable or how
[6223.18 --> 6224.34]  invested i am in the
[6224.34 --> 6226.86]  company so i'll i'll
[6226.86 --> 6227.54]  let luke do the
[6227.54 --> 6228.40]  color commentary on
[6228.40 --> 6228.82]  this one
[6228.82 --> 6230.82]  uh
[6230.82 --> 6235.84]  that just a
[6235.84 --> 6236.52]  discussion question
[6236.52 --> 6236.96]  that's it
[6236.96 --> 6238.34]  i don't know sure
[6238.34 --> 6238.76]  just what do you
[6238.76 --> 6240.20]  think i'm not super
[6240.20 --> 6240.84]  into chromebooks
[6240.84 --> 6241.86]  all righty then
[6241.86 --> 6242.56]  this is not the
[6242.56 --> 6243.20]  framework that i
[6243.20 --> 6243.60]  would buy
[6243.60 --> 6244.74]  okay but
[6244.74 --> 6246.64]  i have already heard
[6246.64 --> 6247.76]  from people that
[6247.76 --> 6248.38]  want to buy it
[6248.38 --> 6250.02]  and we're really
[6250.02 --> 6251.42]  excited that framework
[6251.42 --> 6252.72]  has a chromebook
[6252.72 --> 6253.48]  option now
[6253.48 --> 6254.74]  which i don't
[6254.74 --> 6255.46]  personally 100%
[6255.46 --> 6256.58]  understand but
[6256.58 --> 6257.26]  that's cool
[6257.26 --> 6258.80]  sweet more options
[6258.80 --> 6259.34]  is not bad
[6259.34 --> 6261.18]  i'm excited that
[6261.18 --> 6262.38]  framework is expanding
[6262.38 --> 6262.84]  and doing more
[6262.84 --> 6263.16]  things
[6263.16 --> 6265.90]  uh blah x9 says
[6265.90 --> 6266.80]  if we want to save
[6266.80 --> 6267.94]  ltt money should we
[6267.94 --> 6268.66]  watch on twitch or
[6268.66 --> 6268.92]  youtube
[6268.92 --> 6270.94]  no if you have a
[6270.94 --> 6271.78]  floatplane subscription
[6271.78 --> 6272.60]  you should watch on
[6272.60 --> 6273.02]  floatplane
[6273.02 --> 6274.14]  yeah you're already
[6274.14 --> 6274.72]  you're paying
[6274.72 --> 6275.46]  somewhere between
[6275.46 --> 6276.34]  five and ten dollars
[6276.34 --> 6277.10]  a month assuming
[6277.10 --> 6277.82]  you're not one of
[6277.82 --> 6278.66]  the grandfathered in
[6278.66 --> 6279.98]  three dollar um
[6279.98 --> 6281.42]  subscriptions and
[6281.42 --> 6281.92]  that's fine
[6281.92 --> 6283.06]  we like that's
[6283.06 --> 6283.70]  we want to use the
[6283.70 --> 6284.26]  platform yeah we're
[6284.26 --> 6285.26]  we're profitable at
[6285.26 --> 6286.14]  those kinds of rates
[6286.14 --> 6286.76]  where you run into
[6286.76 --> 6288.34]  trouble is when it's
[6288.34 --> 6289.22]  ad supported because
[6289.22 --> 6290.34]  ads pay like nothing
[6290.34 --> 6292.60]  compared to actual
[6292.60 --> 6294.32]  subscribed users like
[6294.32 --> 6295.50]  we've got 30,000
[6295.50 --> 6296.68]  floatplane subscribers
[6296.68 --> 6297.38]  now which is
[6297.38 --> 6298.56]  absolutely wild you
[6298.56 --> 6300.16]  guys are amazing um
[6300.16 --> 6300.98]  and the last thing we
[6300.98 --> 6301.98]  would want is for you
[6301.98 --> 6303.54]  guys to not enjoy the
[6303.54 --> 6304.70]  better audio quality on
[6304.70 --> 6305.48]  floatplane if you're
[6305.48 --> 6306.32]  gonna have to listen to
[6306.32 --> 6307.82]  us talk for like three
[6307.82 --> 6310.04]  f***ing hours yeah you
[6310.04 --> 6310.62]  should you should get
[6310.62 --> 6311.18]  what you're paying for
[6311.18 --> 6312.30]  yeah stick around stick
[6312.30 --> 6313.96]  around also the chat's
[6313.96 --> 6315.82]  way better um i had a
[6315.82 --> 6316.74]  good question though from
[6316.74 --> 6318.12]  floatplane chat actually
[6318.12 --> 6318.96]  floatplane chat has
[6318.96 --> 6319.82]  been slightly less
[6319.82 --> 6320.84]  deplorable than usual
[6320.84 --> 6322.60]  uh your boy hot pocket
[6322.60 --> 6323.70]  asks so what's the
[6323.70 --> 6324.66]  solution for twitch if
[6324.66 --> 6325.58]  they need more money
[6325.58 --> 6326.84]  better to take a piece
[6326.84 --> 6327.60]  from the top percent
[6327.60 --> 6328.30]  than the streamers who
[6328.30 --> 6329.42]  made considerably less
[6329.42 --> 6330.38]  yeah so that's what i
[6330.38 --> 6331.04]  was actually going to go
[6331.04 --> 6332.34]  into is like yes it's
[6332.34 --> 6333.18]  extremely uncomfortable
[6333.18 --> 6334.80]  but when daddy amazon is
[6334.80 --> 6335.60]  knocking saying you need
[6335.60 --> 6338.16]  to make money their rates
[6338.16 --> 6339.06]  are unsustainable they have
[6339.06 --> 6340.36]  to do something but this
[6340.36 --> 6343.38]  it it's just it always
[6343.38 --> 6344.78]  happens yeah it's like
[6344.78 --> 6345.70]  we've had this we've had
[6345.70 --> 6346.88]  this conversation with so
[6346.88 --> 6348.46]  many creators talking
[6348.46 --> 6349.34]  about coming over on
[6349.34 --> 6350.90]  floatplane where they'll
[6350.90 --> 6353.16]  be like well patreon has
[6353.16 --> 6354.42]  a better revenue split or
[6354.42 --> 6357.02]  insert platform here has a
[6357.02 --> 6357.90]  better revenue split and
[6357.90 --> 6359.26]  we're like okay well see
[6359.26 --> 6360.10]  how that works out for you
[6360.10 --> 6361.82]  because we know what it
[6361.82 --> 6364.44]  costs and at some point
[6364.44 --> 6367.06]  at some point the investors
[6367.06 --> 6369.30]  are gonna come knocking and
[6369.30 --> 6370.96]  they can't just keep dumping
[6370.96 --> 6373.38]  money into it why do you
[6373.38 --> 6375.08]  think youtube has so many
[6375.08 --> 6377.30]  f***ing ads and the whole
[6377.30 --> 6378.78]  name and like why do you
[6378.78 --> 6379.36]  think they're pushing
[6379.36 --> 6382.86]  premium so hard yeah and
[6382.86 --> 6383.80]  luckily premium is actually
[6383.80 --> 6386.18]  pretty good like yeah the
[6386.18 --> 6386.82]  fact that you have like
[6386.82 --> 6388.48]  music as part of it is like
[6388.48 --> 6390.30]  what justifies it for me if
[6390.30 --> 6391.06]  the music wasn't there i
[6391.06 --> 6392.36]  wouldn't do easily yeah yeah
[6392.36 --> 6394.60]  but yeah i don't know it's
[6394.60 --> 6397.58]  um it's tough but the the
[6397.58 --> 6399.52]  idea behind the name of
[6399.52 --> 6400.78]  floatplane which is not
[6400.78 --> 6401.76]  something that we like put on
[6401.76 --> 6402.70]  the site and whatnot because
[6402.70 --> 6403.42]  it's not good for
[6403.42 --> 6404.64]  advertising but it's good
[6404.64 --> 6406.62]  internally i guess the whole
[6406.62 --> 6408.24]  idea behind it is you know
[6408.24 --> 6409.16]  what a floatplane is sea
[6409.16 --> 6411.48]  plane whatever the concept
[6411.48 --> 6412.68]  is it might not take off but
[6412.68 --> 6414.62]  it definitely won't sink so
[6414.62 --> 6416.18]  from the very beginning and
[6416.18 --> 6417.82]  the whole time through we've
[6417.82 --> 6420.08]  kept in our minds we need to
[6420.08 --> 6420.96]  make sure that what we're
[6420.96 --> 6422.70]  doing is sustainable and
[6422.70 --> 6423.84]  there was a big question from
[6423.84 --> 6424.96]  a bunch of creators when they
[6424.96 --> 6426.46]  were first joining because
[6426.46 --> 6429.16]  youtube paid channels which is
[6429.16 --> 6430.02]  different than memberships
[6430.02 --> 6432.66]  youtube paid channels uh went
[6432.66 --> 6434.64]  up in smoke exactly one year
[6434.64 --> 6436.22]  exactly to the day which is
[6436.22 --> 6437.62]  very interesting one year
[6437.62 --> 6438.72]  after vessel went up in
[6438.72 --> 6440.00]  smoke so a lot of creators
[6440.00 --> 6441.98]  around the beginning were
[6441.98 --> 6443.92]  asking are you guys going to
[6443.92 --> 6445.40]  be able to survive for a long
[6445.40 --> 6448.36]  time hello yes we did um but
[6448.36 --> 6449.92]  i love we should go back and
[6449.92 --> 6451.48]  respond remember when i uh
[6451.48 --> 6452.56]  pitched you the concept of
[6452.56 --> 6453.64]  having like a wall of hate
[6453.64 --> 6455.62]  yeah where we would like frame
[6455.62 --> 6457.04]  we would frame people's
[6457.04 --> 6458.50]  comments about how floatplane
[6458.50 --> 6460.18]  was doomed and gonna shut
[6460.18 --> 6461.84]  down and luke would be
[6461.84 --> 6463.36]  unemployed in a year and like
[6463.36 --> 6464.30]  all that stuff and i had
[6464.30 --> 6465.46]  pitched like doing an entire
[6465.46 --> 6467.28]  wall plastered and all those
[6467.28 --> 6468.76]  stupid comments i think i have
[6468.76 --> 6470.04]  some of them but then yeah
[6470.04 --> 6470.94]  that's great i should have
[6470.94 --> 6472.66]  done it but uh but yeah we're
[6472.66 --> 6474.64]  still here because we've we've
[6474.64 --> 6476.06]  tried to build it sustainably
[6476.06 --> 6478.20]  and in some ways that does sure
[6478.20 --> 6479.02]  that does make it less
[6479.02 --> 6480.06]  attractive it makes it a
[6480.06 --> 6481.22]  little bit less competitive it
[6481.22 --> 6483.42]  makes it slower to develop yeah
[6483.42 --> 6484.84]  but that's a lot of things
[6484.84 --> 6486.48]  stuff like this happens on
[6486.48 --> 6487.70]  twitch and stuff like this
[6487.70 --> 6488.76]  has never happened with us
[6488.76 --> 6490.46]  and we're like lol we're
[6490.46 --> 6492.58]  actually trying i'm making no
[6492.58 --> 6494.38]  commitments and i'm making no
[6494.38 --> 6495.34]  commitments on timeline or
[6495.34 --> 6496.16]  anything like that but we're
[6496.16 --> 6497.46]  trying to bring our rates and
[6497.46 --> 6499.42]  stuff down to go the other
[6499.42 --> 6500.68]  direction than what they're
[6500.68 --> 6501.78]  doing yeah well i mean our
[6501.78 --> 6503.24]  team's been amazing it's a
[6503.24 --> 6504.20]  small team but it's a good
[6504.20 --> 6507.38]  team and um like our my
[6507.38 --> 6509.12]  understanding is that our
[6509.12 --> 6511.44]  costs have aside from some
[6511.44 --> 6514.82]  issues lately our costs have
[6514.82 --> 6516.52]  actually gone down in some
[6516.52 --> 6518.38]  ways i know that they haven't
[6518.38 --> 6520.10]  gone down in other ways but
[6520.10 --> 6521.64]  they have come down in some
[6521.64 --> 6523.80]  ways so we're we're we're
[6523.80 --> 6524.90]  holding up we're holding up
[6524.90 --> 6526.28]  great over here yeah we're
[6526.28 --> 6527.20]  doing good yeah we're all
[6527.20 --> 6529.84]  right but yeah like stuff like
[6529.84 --> 6531.16]  this is gonna happen which is
[6531.16 --> 6532.74]  uncomfortable but the same
[6532.74 --> 6535.22]  advice that we've always given
[6535.22 --> 6536.84]  if any creator is watching that
[6536.84 --> 6538.90]  cares to hear it um is to
[6538.90 --> 6541.22]  diversify get into
[6541.22 --> 6542.86]  merch stuff uh if you're a
[6542.86 --> 6544.82]  twitch only streamer start
[6544.82 --> 6546.06]  putting some vods on youtube
[6546.06 --> 6547.54]  start finding a way to
[6547.54 --> 6548.94]  vodify some of your content
[6548.94 --> 6551.16]  whether that's planning out
[6551.16 --> 6552.46]  content that is specifically
[6552.46 --> 6556.16]  made to become a vod um get a
[6556.16 --> 6557.74]  get an editor get them to
[6557.74 --> 6559.60]  watch your streams and find
[6559.60 --> 6560.88]  interesting segments and cut
[6560.88 --> 6561.80]  them out and title them
[6561.80 --> 6562.84]  properly and thumbnail them
[6562.84 --> 6564.24]  properly and throw them up do
[6564.24 --> 6565.98]  whatever but diversify get
[6565.98 --> 6567.24]  yourself out there even if you
[6567.24 --> 6569.18]  don't do like traditional
[6569.18 --> 6570.68]  youtube vods you should
[6570.68 --> 6571.94]  absolutely be doing shorts
[6571.94 --> 6573.12]  which leads us really well
[6573.12 --> 6574.74]  into our next topic here uh
[6574.74 --> 6576.10]  this is straight out of the
[6576.10 --> 6577.82]  youtube blog but this week
[6577.82 --> 6578.68]  youtube announced that
[6578.68 --> 6581.24]  starting early 2023 creators
[6581.24 --> 6582.56]  will be eligible for revenue
[6582.56 --> 6584.76]  sharing on shorts but it's
[6584.76 --> 6585.34]  going to work really
[6585.34 --> 6586.74]  differently from the way that
[6586.74 --> 6588.34]  the revenue share works for
[6588.34 --> 6589.46]  the traditional youtube
[6589.46 --> 6590.50]  partner program and there's
[6591.10 --> 6592.84]  some actually pretty good
[6592.84 --> 6594.02]  reasons for it i don't agree
[6594.02 --> 6595.24]  with everything youtube does i
[6595.24 --> 6597.60]  think i've made it very clear
[6597.60 --> 6601.40]  to everyone i think internally
[6601.40 --> 6603.20]  here i talk about it a lot i
[6603.20 --> 6605.24]  think outwardly on the wan
[6605.24 --> 6607.00]  show and in our videos i talk
[6607.00 --> 6609.44]  about it a lot and i definitely
[6609.44 --> 6610.94]  talk about it to youtube
[6610.94 --> 6613.04]  employees and executives a lot
[6613.04 --> 6615.42]  i do not agree with everything
[6615.42 --> 6617.52]  youtube does but this i'm looking
[6617.52 --> 6620.18]  at going i actually do not have a
[6620.18 --> 6621.30]  better solution to this it's
[6621.30 --> 6624.08]  pretty smart so with traditional
[6624.08 --> 6625.64]  vod or a live stream like this
[6625.64 --> 6628.00]  one on youtube the ads that run
[6628.00 --> 6630.94]  against your video are credited
[6630.94 --> 6633.34]  to you and then you split it i
[6633.34 --> 6634.64]  forget what exactly the split
[6634.64 --> 6636.06]  percentage is but you split it
[6636.06 --> 6638.40]  with youtube and you keep your
[6638.40 --> 6639.58]  part they keep their part and
[6639.58 --> 6641.44]  everybody's happy but here's the
[6641.44 --> 6643.10]  problem with shorts you don't
[6643.10 --> 6647.00]  have an ad like against your
[6647.00 --> 6649.04]  short the ad is going to be
[6649.04 --> 6651.26]  between some shorts and not all
[6651.26 --> 6653.12]  of them and not all of them so it
[6653.12 --> 6654.84]  can't be just like luck of the
[6654.84 --> 6656.60]  draw you happen to get ads in
[6656.60 --> 6657.82]  front of your shorts and then you
[6657.82 --> 6659.42]  get paid and so what the next
[6659.42 --> 6660.80]  three people that didn't get ads
[6660.80 --> 6662.26]  they just don't get paid well
[6662.26 --> 6665.70]  that's stupid right so um the
[6665.70 --> 6667.64]  revenue from ads that run between
[6667.64 --> 6670.04]  shorts are going to be put into a
[6670.04 --> 6673.82]  pool okay but it's a little
[6673.82 --> 6675.32]  complicated because there's kind of
[6675.32 --> 6677.66]  two pools there's one pool for
[6677.66 --> 6679.76]  shorts that do not have licensed
[6679.76 --> 6682.62]  music and there's another pool for
[6682.62 --> 6685.08]  shorts that contain licensed music
[6685.08 --> 6686.60]  so like popular music and we'll
[6686.60 --> 6687.70]  talk about why they have to do that
[6687.70 --> 6690.42]  in a little bit so of the pool
[6690.42 --> 6693.70]  creators will keep 45 percent of the
[6693.70 --> 6696.36]  revenue so of that bucket based on
[6696.36 --> 6699.68]  their share of total shorts views and
[6699.68 --> 6701.64]  that's the same whether they use music
[6701.64 --> 6704.08]  or not the difference is that in the
[6704.08 --> 6706.68]  music bucket the rights holders for
[6706.68 --> 6709.20]  the music get paid first before the
[6709.20 --> 6710.82]  split between creators and youtube
[6710.82 --> 6713.54]  and the reason for that is that
[6713.54 --> 6716.42]  youtube and the music industry had to
[6716.42 --> 6720.30]  do something about tiktok it's clear
[6720.30 --> 6722.18]  that one of the most compelling things
[6722.18 --> 6724.62]  about tiktok is that you can use
[6724.62 --> 6727.30]  popular songs and dance to them or
[6727.30 --> 6729.08]  lip sync to them or do whatever else it
[6729.08 --> 6732.30]  is with them as your soundtrack um for
[6732.30 --> 6734.58]  no cost and the reason for that is that
[6734.58 --> 6736.22]  bite dance just doesn't respect
[6736.22 --> 6738.14]  copyright so they just are like yeah
[6738.14 --> 6743.34]  yeah um pretty much so i guess in a way
[6743.34 --> 6745.18]  you could look at that as a positive
[6745.18 --> 6747.64]  overall for the industry because it
[6747.64 --> 6751.06]  forced it forced the recording industry
[6751.06 --> 6753.48]  to come to the table and find a
[6753.48 --> 6755.90]  solution which is good because we've
[6755.90 --> 6758.14]  actually looked into licensing real
[6758.14 --> 6760.96]  songs for our videos before the costs
[6760.96 --> 6763.64]  make no sense there's all this just
[6763.64 --> 6765.78]  stupid red tape like it's utterly
[6765.78 --> 6768.86]  unattainable for anyone who's not a
[6768.86 --> 6770.86]  fairly large-scale production like it
[6770.86 --> 6773.10]  just doesn't make any sense if i'm only
[6773.10 --> 6774.70]  going to make four hundred dollars on
[6774.70 --> 6776.40]  this video no i'm not going to pay you
[6776.40 --> 6779.16]  ten thousand dollars for an expiring
[6779.16 --> 6781.76]  license for the music to what up to
[6781.76 --> 6783.52]  take the video down after what are you
[6783.52 --> 6785.40]  an idiot like no i'm not going to do
[6785.40 --> 6787.24]  that it's not like people are using this
[6787.24 --> 6789.00]  video to listen to the song it's just
[6789.00 --> 6792.54]  for a like montage like go touch grass
[6792.54 --> 6795.08]  like it's just dumb get out in the real
[6795.08 --> 6797.14]  world it's not how this works yeah so
[6797.14 --> 6799.20]  what it did is it forced the music
[6799.20 --> 6800.82]  industry and youtube didn't tell me any
[6800.82 --> 6802.52]  of this this is all speculation but it's
[6802.52 --> 6804.94]  just very obvious yeah it forced the
[6804.94 --> 6806.82]  recording industry to come to the table
[6806.82 --> 6810.12]  and make a deal because otherwise tiktok
[6810.12 --> 6812.86]  is just going to run amok forever and
[6812.86 --> 6814.82]  there's going to be no way to combat that
[6814.82 --> 6817.40]  aspect of the platform so this is a super
[6817.40 --> 6820.40]  smart way to do it because it rewards
[6820.40 --> 6823.18]  creators no matter what whether they
[6823.18 --> 6824.88]  license music or don't license music
[6824.88 --> 6825.92]  whether they get an ad in front of
[6825.92 --> 6826.98]  their video they don't get an ad in
[6826.98 --> 6830.70]  front of their video and what it looks
[6830.70 --> 6832.20]  like at least on the surface i haven't
[6832.20 --> 6833.62]  seen the payout rates yet but what it
[6833.62 --> 6835.98]  looks like is that compared to tiktok
[6835.98 --> 6837.74]  it is going to all of a sudden become
[6837.74 --> 6840.26]  sustainable to make short form videos
[6840.26 --> 6843.80]  and not just have to do sponsorships
[6843.80 --> 6847.80]  like to actually actually enjoy a share
[6847.80 --> 6849.26]  of the ad-based revenue from the
[6849.26 --> 6853.06]  platform which tiktok famously does not
[6853.06 --> 6856.54]  give anyone so they just steal music
[6856.54 --> 6859.34]  take all the revenue from their users
[6859.34 --> 6864.42]  and are like that well yeah no screw you
[6864.42 --> 6867.26]  too like why are we tolerating this i don't
[6867.26 --> 6870.12]  get it it's been very weird you you were
[6870.12 --> 6872.84]  talking to uh call me chris and you you
[6872.84 --> 6874.32]  talked about revenue share stuff right
[6874.32 --> 6876.46]  yeah like that's like it's a it's a
[6876.46 --> 6878.34]  joke on tiktok they get like nothing
[6878.34 --> 6882.04]  yeah crazy um shorts creators are added
[6882.04 --> 6884.20]  to the partner program if they get 10
[6884.20 --> 6885.76]  million shorts views in the last 90
[6885.76 --> 6887.58]  days and have a thousand subscribers
[6887.58 --> 6890.86]  um creators can still get into the
[6890.86 --> 6892.70]  youtube partner program with 4 000 watch
[6892.70 --> 6895.22]  hours over the last year as well so
[6895.22 --> 6896.66]  there's there's two paths into the
[6896.66 --> 6898.56]  partner program that's a lot of watch
[6898.56 --> 6902.04]  hours on shorts content so it's going
[6902.04 --> 6903.28]  to result in you being a big creator
[6903.28 --> 6904.92]  either way i'm also launching next
[6904.92 --> 6906.44]  year's creator music which will allow
[6906.44 --> 6908.24]  creators to purchase a license or opt
[6908.24 --> 6909.52]  for revenue sharing for commercial
[6909.52 --> 6910.62]  songs they might want to use in their
[6910.62 --> 6912.24]  long format videos which is super cool
[6912.24 --> 6913.82]  really cool our discussion question
[6913.82 --> 6915.82]  here from jonathan horst is is there a
[6915.82 --> 6917.68]  place for commercial music in ltd
[6917.68 --> 6920.72]  videos yes um i was about to say well
[6920.72 --> 6921.92]  i'm sure as hell not sharing my
[6921.92 --> 6923.66]  revenue with them and i'm probably not
[6923.66 --> 6924.66]  going to pay whatever they're going to
[6924.66 --> 6926.76]  ask so probably not we pay very little
[6926.76 --> 6928.40]  for our existing music library and we've
[6928.40 --> 6929.92]  never had a complaint about our music i
[6929.92 --> 6931.42]  guess i'd have to narrow it down
[6931.42 --> 6934.60]  there's one specific uh i almost said
[6934.60 --> 6936.12]  creator warehouse i don't know why one
[6936.12 --> 6937.68]  specific channel superfund video
[6937.68 --> 6941.56]  oh yes that one yeah i yeah i you know
[6941.56 --> 6943.44]  what i even re-upload it with the proper
[6943.44 --> 6945.34]  kenny loggins playing with the boys song
[6945.34 --> 6946.70]  yeah i would do it i'll pay for it sure
[6946.70 --> 6948.48]  yeah okay i'll commit to that if there if
[6948.48 --> 6950.30]  there was a way to effectively do it
[6950.30 --> 6951.70]  that you knew was good and maybe the
[6951.70 --> 6953.58]  pricing wasn't just literally the worst
[6953.58 --> 6956.38]  thing in the world uh i could see it
[6956.38 --> 6958.78]  being used for hyper specific content
[6958.78 --> 6960.86]  but that's about it yeah
[6960.86 --> 6963.50]  uh sam joe axe asks why can't youtube
[6963.50 --> 6965.54]  remove these dumb monetization requirements
[6965.54 --> 6966.98]  since they did it to prevent ads from
[6966.98 --> 6968.24]  showing on stolen videos and they
[6968.24 --> 6969.52]  monetize everything anyway now
[6969.52 --> 6971.84]  uh the answer is because it's a it's a
[6971.84 --> 6973.60]  ton of administrative work to pay people
[6973.60 --> 6976.96]  out and sorry but like the four dollars
[6976.96 --> 6979.92]  or whatever is just not actually worth the
[6979.92 --> 6981.96]  administrative burden for them that's my
[6981.96 --> 6983.54]  that's my best guess but i'm guessing
[6983.54 --> 6987.02]  uh as for like shorts i could see us
[6987.02 --> 6988.30]  using it since there doesn't really seem
[6988.30 --> 6991.76]  to be a penalty for just using it um if
[6991.76 --> 6992.98]  we're if we're gonna have to like kind
[6992.98 --> 6995.26]  of pay for it anyway then i guess we
[6995.26 --> 6997.54]  might as well just go for it but i don't
[6997.54 --> 6999.52]  know what kind of shorts that i would do
[6999.52 --> 7002.42]  that would require licensed music it's
[7002.42 --> 7003.62]  just one of those things that i'm so
[7003.62 --> 7006.64]  conditioned to avoid yeah you know even
[7006.64 --> 7008.14]  if i'm i don't think it's needed anyways
[7008.14 --> 7009.76]  for the type of content that we do i
[7009.76 --> 7014.54]  whatever oh
[7014.54 --> 7018.50]  oh oh someone in full plane chat said
[7018.50 --> 7019.20]  rickroll us
[7019.20 --> 7023.88]  you could rickroll people wow yeah that
[7023.88 --> 7025.64]  makes sense does rickroll return because
[7025.64 --> 7027.34]  you can monetize it now i wouldn't be
[7027.34 --> 7028.84]  able to rickroll them on floatplane
[7028.84 --> 7029.12]  though
[7029.12 --> 7031.48]  yeah get owned my license would be
[7031.48 --> 7034.22]  platform specific yeah get owned well
[7034.22 --> 7036.58]  no i mean that's that's bad okay get on
[7036.58 --> 7038.42]  it get the ria on the phone because i
[7038.42 --> 7039.60]  want you to rickroll people on full
[7039.60 --> 7041.66]  plan i got you boys let's go oh my god
[7041.66 --> 7044.84]  we should probably get into some super
[7044.84 --> 7045.40]  chats here
[7045.40 --> 7050.26]  we don't do those here oh we're crying
[7050.26 --> 7050.68]  out loud
[7050.68 --> 7052.58]  stop calling them super chats how do i
[7052.58 --> 7054.56]  keep calling them super chat come on
[7054.56 --> 7056.28]  all right we have a we have another
[7056.28 --> 7058.30]  topic do we only have five merch
[7058.30 --> 7059.04]  messages today
[7059.04 --> 7060.88]  is this right
[7060.88 --> 7065.78]  the pending ones oh okay you want me to
[7065.78 --> 7067.08]  go through this video game donkey
[7067.08 --> 7068.34]  topic while you look at some
[7068.34 --> 7069.82]  uh potentials yeah sure
[7069.82 --> 7073.62]  youtuber video game donkey starts game
[7073.62 --> 7076.76]  publishing company big mode also known
[7076.76 --> 7078.90]  as uh his plan is for indie games indie
[7078.90 --> 7080.46]  game publishing company video game
[7080.46 --> 7082.20]  donkey is a popular video game reviewer
[7082.20 --> 7084.94]  very true 7.2 million subscribers 11
[7084.94 --> 7087.30]  years of youtube videos almost 1 million
[7087.30 --> 7089.26]  followers on twitch him and his partner
[7089.26 --> 7091.64]  leah are starting a publishing company
[7091.64 --> 7094.76]  known as big mode a passionate voice for
[7094.76 --> 7098.08]  quality originality and fun indie games
[7098.08 --> 7101.20]  he's also asked for indie studios to
[7101.20 --> 7104.88]  apply the form asks mostly standard
[7104.88 --> 7106.66]  questions but there's a box to tick at
[7106.66 --> 7108.58]  the bottom to confirm that your game
[7108.58 --> 7111.14]  doesn't include nfts crypto or blockchain
[7111.14 --> 7113.40]  technology and there is elsewhere on the
[7113.40 --> 7114.94]  site where it says that they are not
[7114.94 --> 7115.98]  interested in those as well
[7115.98 --> 7120.32]  uh the online community has had some
[7120.32 --> 7121.88]  opinions there's been a lot of people
[7121.88 --> 7123.06]  weighing in on this which is pretty
[7123.06 --> 7123.48]  interesting
[7123.48 --> 7127.30]  danny o'dwyer from noclip says uh among
[7127.30 --> 7129.26]  many other things including things that
[7129.26 --> 7130.90]  are slightly more positive like wishing
[7130.90 --> 7132.22]  them good luck and stuff like that if i
[7132.22 --> 7132.76]  remember correctly
[7132.76 --> 7135.50]  um there is one quote though in his many
[7135.50 --> 7137.80]  tweets where he says we got to drop the
[7137.80 --> 7140.84]  naive shtick that having opinions on games
[7140.84 --> 7143.56]  is a qualification for understanding just
[7143.56 --> 7145.86]  about anything about development and i will
[7145.86 --> 7147.72]  i will add in square brackets or
[7147.72 --> 7148.20]  publishing
[7148.20 --> 7151.94]  um rami ismail which i hope hopefully
[7151.94 --> 7153.42]  pronounced that correctly um
[7153.42 --> 7156.60]  vlambeer co-founder says if what a
[7156.60 --> 7159.88]  publisher has uh proven is money and you
[7159.88 --> 7161.92]  and a youtube channel assume the worst
[7161.92 --> 7163.14]  case scenario for your business
[7163.14 --> 7163.74]  considerations
[7163.74 --> 7166.92]  they might f up those and thus the game
[7166.92 --> 7169.22]  might never ship or not be supported i
[7169.22 --> 7171.88]  will also say that again in the expanded
[7171.88 --> 7173.88]  portion of his tweets there was more
[7173.88 --> 7176.92]  positive notes and he mentioned that a
[7176.92 --> 7179.60]  way kind of around this is to ask for
[7179.60 --> 7181.76]  more money until the publisher is more
[7181.76 --> 7184.62]  proven which seems pretty reasonable
[7184.62 --> 7186.14]  vlambeer's been around for a while that
[7186.14 --> 7187.66]  probably comes from knowledge and
[7187.66 --> 7188.10]  experience
[7188.10 --> 7191.48]  um the oh you put the thing in front the
[7191.48 --> 7195.00]  celeste developer uh noel berry hopefully
[7195.00 --> 7198.80]  i'm saying that right as well no no no is a is
[7198.80 --> 7200.78]  pro donkey i don't have exact quote from the
[7200.78 --> 7203.24]  tweets but you can look them up um and
[7203.24 --> 7206.76]  then mike rose who i don't remember i
[7206.76 --> 7209.00]  think he started a publisher here i've
[7209.00 --> 7211.36]  got my i've got it up three different
[7211.36 --> 7214.58]  huge youtubers not donkey asked for calls
[7214.58 --> 7215.94]  with me in the last 18 months saying
[7215.94 --> 7217.62]  they're starting their own publisher and
[7217.62 --> 7219.28]  could they get some advice so pretty
[7219.28 --> 7221.10]  sure we're about to see an influx of i
[7221.10 --> 7223.02]  could do that youtubers having a pop at
[7223.02 --> 7223.68]  publishing
[7223.68 --> 7226.98]  yeah
[7226.98 --> 7232.58]  yep yep yep it's interesting it's very
[7232.58 --> 7234.58]  interesting there's a lot of i could do
[7234.58 --> 7236.42]  that youtubers right now yeah i could make a
[7236.42 --> 7239.08]  screwdriver yeah exactly i think it's
[7239.08 --> 7240.48]  pretty interesting i think it's pretty
[7240.48 --> 7240.78]  cool
[7240.78 --> 7244.58]  if i was an indie developer would i hitch my
[7244.58 --> 7247.42]  horse onto this hitch my carriage onto this
[7247.42 --> 7248.66]  horse there we go i got there
[7248.66 --> 7253.48]  um i don't know not so sure about that i'd
[7253.48 --> 7254.98]  be interested in maybe talking to him
[7254.98 --> 7261.24]  um but i think the uh rami ismail's comments
[7261.24 --> 7263.54]  were actually very good if you read through
[7263.54 --> 7264.12]  his stuff
[7264.12 --> 7266.86]  i'm gonna make an observation um something
[7266.86 --> 7269.36]  that we've realized as part of building
[7269.36 --> 7271.58]  products that we think have an appeal beyond
[7271.58 --> 7273.44]  just our traditional audience like the
[7273.44 --> 7275.94]  screwdriver is that we actually don't know
[7275.94 --> 7277.64]  pretty much anything about traditional
[7277.64 --> 7281.14]  marketing we have our marketing arm built in
[7281.14 --> 7284.12]  to our company because it's like the videos
[7284.12 --> 7289.64]  and it is crazy powerful super powerful um to
[7289.64 --> 7292.06]  the point where you know almost anything else
[7292.06 --> 7296.36]  just feels like this this tiny drop in an
[7296.36 --> 7299.08]  infinite bucket by comparison just utter waste
[7299.08 --> 7299.52]  of time
[7299.52 --> 7304.02]  uh but lots of companies billion dollar
[7304.02 --> 7309.68]  companies do not market themselves via just making their own youtube videos
[7309.68 --> 7315.80]  obviously and so my concern would be that just because you have some business
[7315.80 --> 7320.20]  savvy i like to think i do doesn't necessarily mean that you actually know
[7320.20 --> 7326.40]  anything about these other businesses and maybe you have the savvy to hire people
[7326.40 --> 7332.10]  who know what they're doing in which case power to you but maybe you don't and maybe you
[7332.10 --> 7338.68]  don't have that expertise when it comes to hr and business management and um i don't know i don't
[7338.68 --> 7345.22]  know video game donkey so i i'm this is all just me speaking from my own experience and talking about how
[7345.22 --> 7349.60]  my own expertise in one area does not necessarily translate to another
[7349.60 --> 7354.22]  i do know that donkey making videos about games has
[7354.22 --> 7357.54]  really springboarded those games in the past
[7357.54 --> 7363.74]  i do think that they were often fantastic games which is why he made the video about them
[7363.74 --> 7366.10]  and they probably would have done pretty well without that
[7366.10 --> 7370.00]  um but there have also been indie games out there in the past that have not
[7370.00 --> 7373.50]  really made it that i think were really good
[7373.50 --> 7377.26]  and just didn't make it because the the word just didn't get out far enough
[7377.26 --> 7381.96]  um apparently the the celeste developer specifically brought up
[7381.96 --> 7385.74]  um that donkey discovered their game during
[7385.74 --> 7388.38]  development and made a very early video
[7388.38 --> 7392.30]  um that greatly helped their sales and that makes sense
[7392.30 --> 7396.16]  i'm a flanker says if you're an indie dev bear in mind that the average game on steam
[7396.16 --> 7398.56]  makes a grand total of seventeen thousand dollars
[7398.56 --> 7402.02]  so the risk if you aren't picked up by a mainstream publisher
[7402.02 --> 7403.08]  um
[7403.08 --> 7408.56]  uh i don't know what kind of devolves here yeah i guess it's big
[7408.56 --> 7409.80]  um
[7409.80 --> 7415.56]  so maybe the influencer yeah maybe the influencer could do better than seventeen thousand dollars
[7415.56 --> 7418.02]  i mean almost certainly i guess
[7418.02 --> 7419.44]  so then
[7419.44 --> 7424.12]  it's it's daniel dwyer says some stuff that i think is pretty interesting
[7424.12 --> 7425.24]  um
[7425.24 --> 7427.30]  where is it give me one sec
[7427.30 --> 7433.08]  i don't know where his comments were i thought it was danny that said it
[7434.08 --> 7441.18]  apparently that's the average not median
[7441.18 --> 7449.78]  yeah so that's scary because that includes games that you know make tens or hundreds of millions of dollars
[7449.78 --> 7450.36]  yeah
[7450.36 --> 7452.60]  we'll think about like barrow
[7452.60 --> 7455.68]  there's a lot of junk on steam
[7455.68 --> 7456.28]  yeah
[7456.28 --> 7457.52]  okay
[7457.52 --> 7458.42]  no offense barrow
[7458.42 --> 7460.04]  barrow barrow 2020
[7460.04 --> 7460.62]  yeah
[7460.62 --> 7462.08]  it's mine and luke's favorite game
[7462.08 --> 7462.40]  yeah
[7462.40 --> 7466.00]  let's see how many let's see if we can sell seventeen thousand dollars of barrow 2020
[7466.00 --> 7469.52]  at the price i think literally all of you would have to buy it
[7469.52 --> 7470.34]  it's so cheap
[7470.34 --> 7472.66]  um
[7472.66 --> 7476.96]  danny talks about some of the things that uh video game publishers have to do
[7476.96 --> 7478.64]  i think it was danny i don't know
[7478.64 --> 7481.72]  maybe it's someone else i don't want to put words in his mouth i can't find the tweet right now so
[7481.72 --> 7482.78]  disregard
[7482.78 --> 7483.70]  but
[7483.70 --> 7484.56]  someone
[7484.56 --> 7486.08]  made tweets
[7486.08 --> 7487.02]  talking about
[7487.02 --> 7489.44]  some of the things that video game publishers have to do
[7489.44 --> 7491.26]  and how he questions
[7491.26 --> 7492.46]  the
[7492.46 --> 7495.14]  ability slash experience of people that haven't
[7495.14 --> 7496.08]  ever done it before
[7496.08 --> 7496.42]  yeah
[7496.42 --> 7499.22]  and basing the entire publisher thing on
[7499.22 --> 7500.22]  uh
[7500.22 --> 7502.36]  donkey's knowledge and experience with games
[7502.36 --> 7503.32]  and also
[7503.32 --> 7504.48]  his youtube channel
[7504.48 --> 7504.92]  yeah
[7504.92 --> 7505.48]  is a lot
[7505.48 --> 7506.64]  um
[7506.64 --> 7508.58]  when there's other things that publishers do
[7508.58 --> 7508.90]  like
[7508.90 --> 7509.72]  if i remember correctly
[7509.72 --> 7510.54]  it's like finding
[7510.54 --> 7511.38]  qa
[7511.38 --> 7512.22]  uh
[7512.22 --> 7512.48]  yeah
[7512.48 --> 7514.04]  getting localization support
[7514.04 --> 7514.40]  sure
[7514.40 --> 7516.68]  getting certain deals from different platforms
[7516.68 --> 7517.00]  like
[7517.00 --> 7518.42]  like consoles and stuff
[7518.42 --> 7519.20]  like if i was
[7519.20 --> 7522.72]  if i i would expect my publisher to help me with like music licensing potentially
[7522.72 --> 7524.76]  like i would expect them to make connections for me
[7524.76 --> 7526.30]  there's more stuff to it
[7526.30 --> 7527.08]  traditionally
[7527.08 --> 7528.34]  than just
[7528.34 --> 7529.24]  some input
[7529.24 --> 7530.44]  which could be really good
[7530.44 --> 7531.42]  sure
[7531.42 --> 7532.60]  and also
[7532.60 --> 7533.78]  um
[7533.78 --> 7535.58]  being able to
[7535.58 --> 7536.32]  advertise it
[7536.32 --> 7536.98]  effectively
[7536.98 --> 7538.42]  maybe like a smarter way
[7538.42 --> 7539.88]  would be for donkey to like
[7539.88 --> 7541.12]  and i
[7541.12 --> 7541.30]  i
[7541.30 --> 7542.08]  again
[7542.08 --> 7542.76]  i don't
[7542.76 --> 7544.08]  i've never watched one of his videos
[7544.08 --> 7544.52]  i i
[7544.52 --> 7545.88]  take this for what it is
[7545.88 --> 7546.64]  uh
[7546.64 --> 7547.18]  but maybe
[7547.18 --> 7548.12]  maybe uh
[7548.12 --> 7549.72]  a less all-in
[7549.72 --> 7550.38]  you know
[7550.38 --> 7550.94]  angle
[7550.94 --> 7552.48]  would be to find
[7552.48 --> 7552.94]  you know
[7552.94 --> 7555.28]  say you're looking for indie game projects
[7555.28 --> 7556.84]  to like invest in
[7556.84 --> 7557.92]  um
[7557.92 --> 7561.20]  be more of like a like a like a kingmaker
[7561.20 --> 7562.02]  like a connection
[7562.02 --> 7563.18]  a connection maker
[7563.18 --> 7564.02]  uh
[7564.02 --> 7564.22]  you know
[7564.22 --> 7567.34]  help people get from the point of having like a really good concept
[7567.34 --> 7567.96]  to
[7567.96 --> 7571.18]  to getting on board with a more traditional publisher
[7571.18 --> 7571.62]  i don't know
[7571.62 --> 7572.02]  i'm just
[7572.02 --> 7572.76]  i
[7572.76 --> 7575.76]  if i had to guess i'd say it probably comes from a good place
[7575.76 --> 7579.40]  like i'm sure there's problems in the industry in the indie publishing space
[7579.40 --> 7582.76]  and maybe he's trying to solve them
[7582.76 --> 7583.36]  but
[7583.36 --> 7587.54]  maybe there are maybe there are other ways that that could be done
[7587.54 --> 7588.24]  i mean
[7588.24 --> 7588.94]  who knows
[7588.94 --> 7589.18]  maybe
[7589.18 --> 7590.58]  five years from now
[7590.58 --> 7591.12]  you know
[7591.12 --> 7592.36]  they're going to have
[7592.36 --> 7593.46]  a bunch of you know
[7593.46 --> 7595.06]  really amazing indie games published
[7595.06 --> 7596.72]  and they're gonna absolutely crush it
[7596.72 --> 7597.82]  but i just don't know
[7597.82 --> 7598.54]  maybe yeah
[7598.54 --> 7599.04]  i
[7599.04 --> 7601.58]  well barrow is seven dollars and fifty cents now
[7601.58 --> 7602.26]  don't buy it for that
[7602.26 --> 7603.42]  i think luke and i bought it for like a buck
[7603.42 --> 7603.92]  that's way too expensive
[7603.92 --> 7605.32]  i'm pretty sure it was a dollar
[7605.32 --> 7605.66]  yeah
[7605.66 --> 7606.00]  don't
[7606.00 --> 7608.04]  don't spend more than a dollar on barrow 2020
[7608.04 --> 7609.18]  we bought it as a joke
[7609.18 --> 7609.98]  because it was a dollar
[7609.98 --> 7610.60]  don't
[7610.60 --> 7612.48]  seven dollars is a little bit more than a joke
[7612.48 --> 7613.44]  um
[7613.44 --> 7615.42]  what was i gonna say
[7615.42 --> 7616.28]  yeah i don't know
[7616.28 --> 7618.20]  i i do think that
[7618.20 --> 7620.30]  there has been a lot of comments made
[7620.30 --> 7622.00]  externally
[7622.00 --> 7623.36]  without
[7623.36 --> 7625.58]  a ton of comments made
[7625.58 --> 7626.96]  from donkey
[7626.96 --> 7628.80]  the site's up
[7628.80 --> 7630.10]  and there's a video
[7630.10 --> 7631.10]  and that's it
[7631.10 --> 7632.52]  he hasn't responded to anything
[7632.52 --> 7633.68]  maybe
[7633.68 --> 7634.16]  they
[7634.16 --> 7635.06]  i know
[7635.06 --> 7636.50]  him and his partner
[7636.50 --> 7637.42]  leah started it
[7637.42 --> 7639.94]  maybe there's more people there
[7639.94 --> 7642.30]  there's a talent search on the website
[7642.30 --> 7643.58]  it says they're hiring people
[7643.58 --> 7646.38]  it does say that they're hiring people involved with making games
[7646.38 --> 7648.18]  not necessarily hiring people involved with publishing
[7648.18 --> 7649.48]  um
[7649.48 --> 7650.12]  but like
[7650.12 --> 7652.34]  i don't know
[7652.34 --> 7653.48]  i wouldn't write it off yet
[7653.48 --> 7654.66]  um
[7654.66 --> 7656.12]  donkey's been around for a long time
[7656.12 --> 7657.52]  i'm sure this isn't just like
[7657.52 --> 7660.32]  you know
[7660.32 --> 7661.34]  stupidly made
[7661.34 --> 7663.28]  i'm sure there's a little bit more thought process to it
[7663.28 --> 7664.00]  hope so
[7664.00 --> 7664.72]  we'll see though
[7664.72 --> 7665.72]  i don't know
[7665.72 --> 7670.66]  the website does obviously feel very early on
[7670.66 --> 7673.76]  the fact that they have a tab for games already
[7673.76 --> 7674.58]  even though
[7674.58 --> 7676.00]  they launched like
[7676.00 --> 7676.96]  now
[7676.96 --> 7677.90]  um
[7677.90 --> 7678.52]  is
[7678.52 --> 7680.58]  optimistic
[7680.58 --> 7682.52]  yeah
[7682.52 --> 7685.40]  takes a while to make things you know
[7685.40 --> 7687.56]  okay
[7687.56 --> 7689.44]  yeah conrad from the floatplane team says
[7689.44 --> 7690.78]  i have total faith in donkey
[7690.78 --> 7693.16]  all right
[7693.16 --> 7693.88]  all right
[7693.88 --> 7694.76]  uh
[7694.76 --> 7695.64]  we should do for a few
[7695.64 --> 7696.42]  do a few more
[7696.42 --> 7698.38]  merch messages
[7698.38 --> 7699.16]  merch messages
[7699.16 --> 7701.06]  good job
[7701.06 --> 7702.00]  you got it
[7702.00 --> 7702.38]  okay
[7702.38 --> 7703.28]  i'm a good boy
[7703.28 --> 7703.90]  i'm a good boy
[7703.90 --> 7704.94]  i'm a good boy
[7704.94 --> 7707.24]  all right
[7707.24 --> 7707.84]  uh
[7707.84 --> 7709.28]  first message here from
[7709.28 --> 7710.28]  unon
[7710.28 --> 7711.92]  people made fun of me when i said anon
[7711.92 --> 7712.92]  but i feel like that's correct
[7712.92 --> 7713.76]  hey guys
[7713.76 --> 7715.40]  decided to buy the sad linus pad
[7715.40 --> 7715.70]  and
[7715.70 --> 7717.46]  as a christmas gift for my brother
[7717.46 --> 7719.74]  what has been your guys's favorite gifts
[7719.74 --> 7721.24]  you've ever given or received
[7721.24 --> 7722.94]  oh
[7722.94 --> 7723.92]  wow
[7723.92 --> 7724.86]  one year my girlfriend
[7724.86 --> 7726.50]  gave me this like
[7726.50 --> 7727.56]  leather
[7727.56 --> 7730.58]  it looks like a professor's bag
[7730.58 --> 7731.50]  yeah
[7731.50 --> 7732.60]  and i was like
[7732.60 --> 7733.52]  what
[7733.52 --> 7734.96]  that's weird
[7734.96 --> 7736.52]  but it was heavy
[7736.52 --> 7737.20]  so i was like okay
[7737.20 --> 7738.04]  there's something in it
[7738.04 --> 7739.02]  and i open it up
[7739.02 --> 7740.22]  and she made
[7740.22 --> 7741.86]  because i'm probably hard to give gifts for
[7741.86 --> 7743.52]  because i don't care about all that much
[7743.52 --> 7743.68]  anything
[7743.68 --> 7745.74]  and if i do i probably have it
[7745.74 --> 7746.58]  so
[7746.58 --> 7749.08]  she did something really cool
[7749.08 --> 7750.18]  which was she filled it
[7750.18 --> 7750.90]  as if
[7750.90 --> 7752.00]  i was
[7752.00 --> 7753.30]  a pokemon professor
[7753.30 --> 7755.50]  going out for like a day
[7755.50 --> 7756.68]  that's hilarious
[7756.68 --> 7757.34]  and it had
[7757.34 --> 7758.34]  a lot of things that were like
[7758.34 --> 7758.70]  actually
[7758.70 --> 7760.14]  really really cool
[7760.14 --> 7760.92]  and it was genuinely
[7760.92 --> 7762.38]  really really well thought out
[7762.38 --> 7763.18]  and that's like
[7763.18 --> 7764.12]  one of the coolest things
[7764.12 --> 7764.90]  that i think i've
[7764.90 --> 7765.68]  i've received
[7765.68 --> 7766.12]  uh
[7766.12 --> 7767.02]  yvonne's made me like
[7767.02 --> 7767.96]  a ton of stuff
[7767.96 --> 7768.54]  um
[7768.54 --> 7769.26]  like my wallet
[7769.26 --> 7770.18]  is handmade
[7770.18 --> 7771.00]  um
[7771.00 --> 7772.54]  she made me this like
[7772.54 --> 7773.78]  cross-stitched linus
[7773.78 --> 7774.40]  in a blanket
[7774.40 --> 7775.40]  uh
[7775.40 --> 7776.16]  she used to give me
[7776.16 --> 7777.70]  a scrapbook of our year together
[7777.70 --> 7778.40]  every year
[7778.40 --> 7780.20]  for like the first five or six years
[7780.20 --> 7780.78]  that's pretty cool
[7780.78 --> 7781.54]  um
[7781.54 --> 7783.66]  so i i'd say just uh
[7783.66 --> 7785.96]  she gave me my tj07 case
[7785.96 --> 7786.96]  uh
[7786.96 --> 7788.16]  my first pair of like
[7788.16 --> 7789.50]  really nice headphones
[7789.50 --> 7790.48]  um
[7790.48 --> 7791.18]  i'd say just like
[7791.18 --> 7792.66]  just about anything from yvonne
[7792.66 --> 7793.58]  it's usually pretty
[7793.58 --> 7794.76]  pretty sick
[7794.76 --> 7795.68]  as for the best
[7795.68 --> 7798.64]  the best one i ever came up with
[7798.64 --> 7799.36]  man
[7799.36 --> 7799.92]  i don't
[7799.92 --> 7800.76]  i don't know
[7800.76 --> 7803.00]  um
[7803.00 --> 7808.84]  like i've
[7808.84 --> 7809.74]  kind of hard to judge
[7809.74 --> 7810.60]  yeah like i've definitely
[7810.60 --> 7811.66]  come up with some like
[7811.66 --> 7812.48]  pretty good
[7812.48 --> 7813.66]  like corny ideas
[7813.66 --> 7814.22]  because that's what
[7814.22 --> 7814.86]  yvonne's into
[7814.86 --> 7815.96]  like this one time
[7815.96 --> 7817.06]  back when we were dating
[7817.06 --> 7818.00]  uh
[7818.00 --> 7818.34]  i
[7818.34 --> 7820.10]  i made like a spoof of
[7820.10 --> 7821.42]  like a driver's license
[7821.42 --> 7822.96]  but it's like a happiness license
[7822.96 --> 7824.54]  and it's like
[7824.54 --> 7826.22]  because we'll be together forever
[7826.22 --> 7827.28]  expires never
[7827.28 --> 7827.90]  wow
[7827.90 --> 7828.48]  uh
[7828.48 --> 7829.38]  and and like on
[7829.38 --> 7830.26]  like just like
[7830.26 --> 7830.98]  like yeah
[7830.98 --> 7832.20]  it was just like so cheesy
[7832.20 --> 7833.42]  um
[7833.42 --> 7834.70]  i like got it laminated
[7834.70 --> 7835.30]  and everything
[7835.30 --> 7836.72]  i'd completely forgotten
[7836.72 --> 7837.82]  about it until she showed
[7837.82 --> 7838.60]  it to me recently
[7838.60 --> 7840.72]  uh
[7840.72 --> 7842.06]  aj says so the kids
[7842.06 --> 7842.84]  are not the best thing
[7842.84 --> 7843.34]  she gave you
[7843.34 --> 7844.36]  hey i was involved
[7844.36 --> 7846.26]  i helped make those
[7846.26 --> 7847.76]  i mean my part's like
[7847.76 --> 7848.86]  pretty fun compared to
[7848.86 --> 7849.32]  well yeah
[7849.32 --> 7850.14]  yeah sure
[7850.14 --> 7850.64]  yeah
[7850.64 --> 7852.20]  you're definitely super involved
[7852.20 --> 7853.72]  oh man
[7853.72 --> 7854.92]  that's very funny
[7854.92 --> 7857.88]  all right next up
[7857.88 --> 7860.10]  next question here
[7860.10 --> 7860.72]  is from ryan
[7860.72 --> 7862.04]  what are the pros and cons
[7862.04 --> 7863.04]  to connecting my psu
[7863.04 --> 7864.50]  to a 220 volt power
[7864.50 --> 7866.08]  and did you consider using 220
[7866.08 --> 7867.32]  for your personal setup
[7867.32 --> 7869.28]  i am using 220
[7869.28 --> 7870.34]  for my personal setup
[7870.34 --> 7871.64]  uh
[7871.64 --> 7872.88]  the pros and cons
[7872.88 --> 7873.30]  are
[7873.30 --> 7874.08]  pro
[7874.08 --> 7875.24]  it's more efficient
[7875.24 --> 7877.04]  con
[7877.04 --> 7879.02]  it's 220 volt
[7879.02 --> 7879.62]  so you gotta go
[7879.62 --> 7881.12]  find a 220 volt outlet
[7881.12 --> 7881.86]  in your house
[7881.86 --> 7882.66]  if you don't already
[7882.66 --> 7883.18]  have one
[7883.18 --> 7883.70]  because you're
[7883.70 --> 7884.32]  in europe
[7884.32 --> 7885.54]  um
[7885.54 --> 7887.44]  that that's about it
[7887.44 --> 7888.54]  yeah
[7888.54 --> 7889.42]  it's more efficient
[7889.42 --> 7890.52]  which is pretty cool
[7890.52 --> 7893.00]  from fabian
[7893.00 --> 7895.08]  with evga pulling out of gpus
[7895.08 --> 7896.34]  do you think more niche brands
[7896.34 --> 7896.98]  like yeston
[7896.98 --> 7898.60]  and with their waifu gpus
[7898.60 --> 7899.60]  might be able to expand out
[7899.60 --> 7900.24]  and fill the space
[7900.24 --> 7901.24]  i don't think so
[7901.24 --> 7901.72]  i think
[7901.72 --> 7903.26]  i think really it's gonna be
[7903.26 --> 7903.74]  the
[7903.74 --> 7905.10]  like the the big
[7905.10 --> 7906.08]  the big three
[7906.08 --> 7907.02]  your msi's
[7907.02 --> 7907.70]  your gigabyte's
[7907.70 --> 7908.52]  your esus's
[7908.52 --> 7909.62]  i don't think as rock
[7909.62 --> 7911.06]  has an nvidia board partnership
[7911.06 --> 7912.22]  i think they're amd only
[7912.22 --> 7913.50]  um
[7913.50 --> 7915.46]  yeah i just
[7915.46 --> 7916.62]  i just don't see it
[7916.62 --> 7917.86]  in the north american market
[7917.86 --> 7919.34]  like at the end of the day
[7919.34 --> 7920.40]  it always comes down
[7920.40 --> 7921.70]  to manufacturing capacity
[7921.70 --> 7922.92]  and they just
[7922.92 --> 7923.80]  have
[7923.80 --> 7924.64]  the most
[7924.64 --> 7926.12]  the nvidia can't
[7926.12 --> 7926.70]  ignore them
[7926.70 --> 7927.32]  they can't
[7927.32 --> 7928.46]  not allocate to them
[7928.46 --> 7929.84]  i mean
[7929.84 --> 7930.16]  well
[7930.16 --> 7930.68]  they might
[7930.68 --> 7930.98]  but
[7930.98 --> 7931.98]  it's stupid
[7931.98 --> 7932.58]  like they
[7932.58 --> 7934.06]  they kind of need each other
[7934.06 --> 7934.56]  it's like
[7934.56 --> 7935.16]  it's like a
[7935.16 --> 7937.10]  toxic codependent relationship
[7937.10 --> 7937.74]  at this point
[7937.74 --> 7941.44]  question here from anon
[7941.44 --> 7942.68]  my wife and i are both devs
[7942.68 --> 7943.44]  and we share our laptop
[7943.44 --> 7944.20]  and desktops
[7944.20 --> 7944.98]  any suggestions
[7944.98 --> 7946.90]  on reliably running windows
[7946.90 --> 7947.46]  as vm
[7947.46 --> 7948.26]  so we don't step on each
[7948.26 --> 7948.98]  other's environments
[7948.98 --> 7952.86]  i can't really speak to that
[7952.86 --> 7953.62]  i don't know what
[7953.62 --> 7954.64]  you would need
[7954.64 --> 7956.14]  that different user accounts
[7956.14 --> 7957.16]  wouldn't accomplish
[7957.16 --> 7958.62]  like
[7958.62 --> 7959.24]  yeah
[7959.24 --> 7962.78]  i like different user accounts
[7962.78 --> 7963.58]  if you want to be super
[7963.58 --> 7964.30]  hardcore about it
[7964.30 --> 7964.90]  i have also
[7964.90 --> 7966.20]  preferred just
[7966.20 --> 7967.54]  different partitions
[7967.54 --> 7968.06]  yeah
[7968.06 --> 7969.08]  if it's really important
[7969.08 --> 7970.24]  to keep them very separated
[7970.24 --> 7970.64]  just
[7970.64 --> 7971.16]  yeah like
[7971.16 --> 7971.90]  if you both have like
[7971.90 --> 7972.48]  ndas
[7972.48 --> 7973.32]  that you literally
[7973.32 --> 7974.64]  cannot have your spouse
[7974.64 --> 7975.30]  see or whatever
[7975.30 --> 7976.22]  partition them out dude
[7976.22 --> 7976.68]  yeah
[7976.68 --> 7977.56]  yeah that would work
[7977.56 --> 7978.80]  then you could just have them
[7978.80 --> 7980.22]  each like bitlockered
[7980.22 --> 7982.48]  just like two separate drives
[7982.48 --> 7982.80]  even
[7982.80 --> 7983.62]  would definitely work
[7983.62 --> 7984.12]  in the desktop
[7984.12 --> 7986.18]  i i suggest
[7986.18 --> 7987.22]  i have made suggestions
[7987.22 --> 7987.96]  to our own devs
[7987.96 --> 7988.60]  for partitions
[7988.60 --> 7989.12]  yeah
[7989.12 --> 7992.60]  from igor
[7992.60 --> 7994.12]  with all the tech you own
[7994.12 --> 7994.50]  e4
[7994.50 --> 7994.98]  but yes
[7994.98 --> 7996.30]  sorry it's my accent
[7996.30 --> 7997.46]  with all the tech you own
[7997.46 --> 7998.22]  phones
[7998.22 --> 7998.78]  wearables
[7998.78 --> 7999.40]  handhelds
[7999.40 --> 7999.76]  pcs
[7999.76 --> 8000.10]  etc
[8000.10 --> 8001.06]  do you miss the times
[8001.06 --> 8001.56]  when you only had
[8001.56 --> 8002.40]  one or two devices
[8002.40 --> 8003.10]  do you feel like
[8003.10 --> 8003.74]  you have less time
[8003.74 --> 8004.20]  during the day
[8004.20 --> 8005.10]  with everything you use
[8005.10 --> 8006.06]  and have to keep charged
[8006.06 --> 8007.26]  digital detox
[8007.26 --> 8008.88]  i've been working on this
[8008.88 --> 8009.58]  a little bit personally
[8009.58 --> 8010.48]  i uh
[8010.48 --> 8011.92]  i had tiktok installed
[8011.92 --> 8013.38]  for i think about a week
[8013.38 --> 8014.64]  and then i
[8014.64 --> 8016.42]  i realized that my brain
[8016.42 --> 8017.24]  was slowly
[8017.24 --> 8018.12]  uh
[8018.12 --> 8019.28]  turning into a
[8019.28 --> 8020.76]  a useless goo
[8020.76 --> 8021.88]  um
[8021.88 --> 8023.10]  and then i uninstalled it
[8023.10 --> 8023.50]  and was like
[8023.50 --> 8023.92]  no
[8023.92 --> 8025.12]  and i've been
[8025.12 --> 8026.36]  there was a
[8026.36 --> 8027.28]  a while back
[8027.28 --> 8027.74]  where i was like
[8027.74 --> 8028.56]  really into reddit
[8028.56 --> 8029.68]  and then i was like
[8029.68 --> 8030.14]  nope
[8030.14 --> 8031.24]  that's gotta stop
[8031.24 --> 8031.82]  i think
[8031.82 --> 8033.80]  it's all designed
[8033.80 --> 8034.78]  to be so addictive
[8034.78 --> 8035.62]  it's i
[8035.62 --> 8036.46]  it's not the device
[8036.46 --> 8037.26]  that's the problem
[8037.26 --> 8038.54]  yes
[8038.54 --> 8039.74]  it's the services
[8039.74 --> 8040.38]  and stuff on it
[8040.38 --> 8041.36]  i said this before
[8041.36 --> 8042.38]  on wanshow a while back
[8042.38 --> 8042.70]  where
[8042.70 --> 8043.76]  um
[8043.76 --> 8045.12]  like everyday life
[8045.12 --> 8046.50]  is constant pvp
[8046.50 --> 8047.46]  um
[8047.46 --> 8049.66]  and i think it's very true
[8049.66 --> 8051.06]  and you need to be aware
[8051.06 --> 8051.90]  that basically
[8051.90 --> 8053.04]  everything
[8053.04 --> 8053.10]  everything
[8053.10 --> 8054.26]  is either
[8054.26 --> 8055.76]  specifically on your team
[8055.76 --> 8056.84]  which is usually
[8056.84 --> 8057.60]  just gonna be like
[8057.60 --> 8058.16]  people
[8058.16 --> 8060.44]  and then everything else
[8060.44 --> 8061.48]  is against you
[8061.48 --> 8062.20]  in some way
[8062.20 --> 8063.56]  it wants something
[8063.56 --> 8064.08]  from you
[8064.08 --> 8065.22]  it wants your time
[8065.22 --> 8066.30]  it wants your money
[8066.30 --> 8067.12]  it wants
[8067.12 --> 8067.98]  something
[8067.98 --> 8069.16]  and you have to
[8069.16 --> 8069.52]  that's
[8069.52 --> 8071.20]  you gotta stop repeating yourself
[8071.20 --> 8073.24]  everyone knows time is money
[8073.24 --> 8074.02]  yeah yeah yeah
[8074.02 --> 8074.88]  it wants your money
[8074.88 --> 8075.80]  it wants your money
[8075.80 --> 8076.68]  it wants your money
[8076.68 --> 8077.22]  it wants your other form of money
[8077.22 --> 8078.42]  it wants your other more different money
[8078.42 --> 8079.24]  pretty much yeah
[8079.24 --> 8079.64]  it's just
[8079.64 --> 8081.42]  it all effectively comes down to money
[8081.42 --> 8082.64]  and you have to be aware
[8082.64 --> 8083.62]  when you're using these things
[8083.62 --> 8084.40]  that that's happening
[8084.40 --> 8086.40]  and that has a cost on you
[8086.40 --> 8087.12]  um
[8087.12 --> 8087.80]  even if you're like
[8087.80 --> 8088.38]  oh like
[8088.38 --> 8089.06]  i don't know
[8089.06 --> 8090.14]  i've just got some time to burn
[8090.14 --> 8091.90]  you could be doing something else
[8091.90 --> 8094.32]  maybe you do want to genuinely
[8094.32 --> 8095.24]  just burn that time
[8095.24 --> 8095.88]  and that's okay
[8095.88 --> 8096.74]  but i think
[8096.74 --> 8097.94]  you have to understand
[8097.94 --> 8098.52]  that you
[8098.52 --> 8100.26]  you could be doing something else
[8100.26 --> 8100.74]  you could
[8100.74 --> 8102.16]  get up and go for a walk
[8102.16 --> 8102.60]  you could
[8102.60 --> 8103.28]  uh
[8103.28 --> 8104.24]  learn a new skill
[8104.24 --> 8105.14]  and if you're like
[8105.14 --> 8106.02]  i can't learn a new skill
[8106.02 --> 8106.52]  when i'm like
[8106.52 --> 8107.34]  sitting in an elevator
[8107.34 --> 8108.24]  yes you can
[8108.24 --> 8109.42]  aj from floatplane
[8109.42 --> 8110.08]  makes a good point
[8110.08 --> 8110.92]  youtube adding shorts
[8110.92 --> 8112.04]  is kind of ruining my life
[8112.04 --> 8113.32]  i did the same thing as luke
[8113.32 --> 8114.16]  but now
[8114.16 --> 8115.04]  when i go on youtube
[8115.04 --> 8116.38]  which i like actually need
[8116.38 --> 8118.00]  shorts are alongside videos
[8118.00 --> 8118.98]  so i can't
[8118.98 --> 8120.14]  keep them out of my life
[8120.14 --> 8121.02]  without still in
[8121.02 --> 8121.66]  while i could
[8121.66 --> 8122.52]  while still enjoying
[8122.52 --> 8123.68]  my youtube watching habits
[8123.68 --> 8124.98]  one thing i will say
[8124.98 --> 8126.10]  is that if you have the discipline
[8126.10 --> 8127.28]  to ignore shorts
[8127.28 --> 8127.92]  for long enough
[8127.92 --> 8129.12]  they will actually not put them
[8129.12 --> 8129.58]  in front of you
[8129.58 --> 8130.26]  nearly as much
[8130.26 --> 8130.74]  that's
[8130.74 --> 8131.82]  that's just youtube
[8131.82 --> 8133.04]  doing youtube things
[8133.04 --> 8134.44]  but it's totally valid
[8134.44 --> 8134.98]  uh
[8134.98 --> 8135.42]  one of the things
[8135.42 --> 8136.64]  that really frustrates me
[8136.64 --> 8138.32]  as a youtube creator
[8138.32 --> 8139.40]  but not really
[8139.40 --> 8140.30]  a big consumer
[8140.30 --> 8141.48]  is that
[8141.48 --> 8143.22]  i have no ways
[8143.22 --> 8144.16]  to do
[8144.16 --> 8146.12]  certain creator tasks
[8146.12 --> 8148.32]  within the creator studio app
[8148.32 --> 8150.08]  so if i want to post
[8150.08 --> 8150.76]  for example
[8150.76 --> 8152.20]  a community post
[8152.20 --> 8153.34]  or even
[8153.34 --> 8154.48]  can i even read
[8154.48 --> 8155.32]  community posts
[8155.32 --> 8156.16]  within the
[8156.16 --> 8157.28]  studio app
[8157.28 --> 8158.98]  i i'm not sure
[8158.98 --> 8159.86]  i'm there might be
[8159.86 --> 8160.78]  a way for me to do that
[8160.78 --> 8161.76]  let me check content
[8161.76 --> 8162.98]  e
[8162.98 --> 8164.96]  no no i don't
[8164.96 --> 8165.98]  yeah i don't see
[8165.98 --> 8167.22]  i don't see community posts
[8167.22 --> 8167.70]  in the content
[8167.70 --> 8168.10]  yeah so
[8168.10 --> 8169.14]  there's certain things
[8169.14 --> 8170.02]  that if i want to do them
[8170.02 --> 8171.78]  i have to open the consumption app
[8171.78 --> 8172.64]  and it is amazing
[8172.64 --> 8173.76]  how often it manages
[8173.76 --> 8174.80]  to put something in front of me
[8174.80 --> 8175.22]  that i'm like
[8175.22 --> 8176.30]  oh i can't look away from this
[8176.30 --> 8177.12]  and
[8177.12 --> 8178.22]  like i'm working
[8178.22 --> 8180.14]  like i don't actually
[8180.14 --> 8182.30]  i should bring that up with them
[8182.30 --> 8182.78]  i've been
[8182.78 --> 8183.68]  i've been meaning to
[8183.68 --> 8184.42]  i've been meaning to
[8184.42 --> 8185.00]  kind of drill
[8185.00 --> 8185.94]  into them
[8185.94 --> 8187.00]  how important i think it is
[8187.00 --> 8187.86]  that creator studio
[8187.86 --> 8188.42]  should be for
[8188.42 --> 8189.98]  should have all the creator stuff
[8189.98 --> 8191.02]  and that's a big part of it
[8191.02 --> 8191.30]  it's like
[8191.30 --> 8192.28]  i got stuff to do
[8192.28 --> 8194.24]  and i don't want
[8194.24 --> 8195.16]  the creator studio app
[8195.16 --> 8195.74]  to be a replacement
[8195.74 --> 8196.34]  for the player
[8196.34 --> 8197.56]  but i don't want the player
[8197.56 --> 8198.36]  to serve the purpose
[8198.36 --> 8199.52]  of the creator studio app
[8199.52 --> 8199.78]  i'm
[8199.78 --> 8201.72]  i'm in a very different mindset
[8201.72 --> 8203.18]  when i am working
[8203.18 --> 8204.52]  versus when i am idly
[8204.52 --> 8204.98]  you know
[8204.98 --> 8206.16]  consuming youtube videos
[8206.16 --> 8209.36]  yeah
[8209.36 --> 8211.32]  no long answer
[8211.32 --> 8211.84]  but yeah
[8211.84 --> 8213.44]  next question here
[8213.44 --> 8213.94]  from lachlan
[8213.94 --> 8215.30]  hi lanus
[8215.30 --> 8215.76]  i was wondering
[8215.76 --> 8216.76]  how you are liking
[8216.76 --> 8218.62]  your sony a95k tv
[8218.62 --> 8219.16]  in the new house
[8219.16 --> 8219.68]  after having it
[8219.68 --> 8220.28]  for a few months
[8220.28 --> 8221.02]  i recently bought
[8221.02 --> 8221.56]  one as an upgrade
[8221.56 --> 8223.08]  from a 10 year old lcd
[8223.08 --> 8223.92]  and love it
[8223.92 --> 8224.76]  agreed
[8224.76 --> 8225.94]  it's
[8225.94 --> 8227.14]  the best tv
[8227.14 --> 8227.72]  on the market
[8227.72 --> 8229.72]  and it's really
[8229.72 --> 8230.42]  really good
[8230.42 --> 8231.14]  it's really funny
[8231.14 --> 8232.48]  i came home
[8232.48 --> 8233.14]  from my trip
[8233.14 --> 8233.72]  last night
[8233.72 --> 8234.80]  and my son
[8234.80 --> 8235.30]  was sitting
[8235.30 --> 8236.78]  in the family room
[8236.78 --> 8238.42]  watching a movie
[8238.42 --> 8239.50]  i was like
[8239.50 --> 8241.62]  hey
[8241.62 --> 8242.16]  you know there's
[8242.16 --> 8243.12]  a theater downstairs
[8243.12 --> 8243.58]  right
[8243.58 --> 8244.38]  he's like
[8244.38 --> 8244.88]  yeah
[8244.88 --> 8246.16]  yeah
[8246.16 --> 8251.98]  why do i
[8251.98 --> 8252.84]  even bother
[8252.84 --> 8254.36]  you know
[8254.36 --> 8254.62]  what i would
[8254.62 --> 8254.92]  have given
[8254.92 --> 8255.68]  for a theater
[8255.68 --> 8256.56]  at his age
[8256.56 --> 8260.00]  question here
[8260.00 --> 8260.64]  from michael
[8260.64 --> 8261.84]  for some
[8261.84 --> 8262.96]  future proofing
[8262.96 --> 8263.40]  what would you
[8263.40 --> 8264.30]  would you
[8264.30 --> 8264.80]  recommend
[8264.80 --> 8266.36]  this is a hard
[8266.36 --> 8266.98]  sentence for me
[8266.98 --> 8268.02]  for some future
[8268.02 --> 8268.42]  proofing
[8268.42 --> 8268.90]  what would you
[8268.90 --> 8269.22]  recommend
[8269.22 --> 8269.90]  for a zenforce
[8269.90 --> 8270.34]  cpu
[8270.34 --> 8271.40]  the ryzen 9
[8271.40 --> 8272.46]  7900x
[8272.46 --> 8273.44]  or the ryzen 9
[8273.44 --> 8274.70]  7950x
[8274.70 --> 8275.08]  well
[8275.08 --> 8275.84]  purposes gaming
[8275.84 --> 8276.22]  streaming
[8276.22 --> 8277.32]  and unreal 5
[8277.32 --> 8277.98]  game development
[8277.98 --> 8279.12]  because i know
[8279.12 --> 8279.72]  the answer
[8279.72 --> 8280.60]  i won't say
[8280.60 --> 8281.10]  anything
[8281.10 --> 8283.50]  future proofing
[8283.50 --> 8284.30]  is a bad way
[8284.30 --> 8285.04]  to go about it
[8285.04 --> 8287.26]  don't plan that
[8287.26 --> 8287.52]  way
[8287.52 --> 8289.28]  nice
[8289.28 --> 8291.76]  sorry
[8291.76 --> 8292.96]  you're just
[8292.96 --> 8293.58]  gonna have to
[8293.58 --> 8294.26]  wait and see
[8294.26 --> 8294.92]  what the performance
[8294.92 --> 8296.12]  of these cpus is
[8296.12 --> 8297.24]  they're not out yet
[8297.24 --> 8299.84]  they're coming
[8299.84 --> 8300.88]  soon-ish i think
[8300.88 --> 8302.00]  maybe maybe chat
[8302.00 --> 8303.16]  will uh maybe chat
[8303.16 --> 8303.92]  will discuss it
[8303.92 --> 8304.46]  and you guys can
[8304.46 --> 8304.90]  have some good
[8304.90 --> 8305.78]  conversation about it
[8305.78 --> 8306.56]  but i cannot
[8306.56 --> 8308.06]  uh join in
[8308.06 --> 8308.68]  there's so many
[8308.68 --> 8309.38]  the second you
[8309.38 --> 8309.88]  throw around
[8309.88 --> 8310.66]  future proofing
[8310.66 --> 8311.46]  it's a very
[8311.46 --> 8312.14]  frustrating term
[8312.14 --> 8313.04]  to deal with
[8313.04 --> 8313.70]  because the second
[8313.70 --> 8314.24]  you throw around
[8314.24 --> 8314.76]  that term
[8314.76 --> 8316.72]  your your budget
[8316.72 --> 8317.34]  your disposable
[8317.34 --> 8317.88]  income
[8317.88 --> 8318.58]  your interest
[8318.58 --> 8319.18]  in the product
[8319.18 --> 8319.92]  all these different
[8319.92 --> 8320.50]  things come up
[8320.50 --> 8320.82]  your performance
[8320.82 --> 8321.26]  needs
[8321.26 --> 8322.68]  they they they
[8322.68 --> 8323.30]  all come up
[8323.30 --> 8324.06]  and they you
[8324.06 --> 8325.28]  you cannot define
[8325.28 --> 8326.44]  them very easily
[8326.44 --> 8327.38]  at all to any
[8327.38 --> 8327.86]  other people
[8327.86 --> 8328.74]  and if you could
[8328.74 --> 8329.14]  it's going to
[8329.14 --> 8329.90]  take a lot of
[8329.90 --> 8330.16]  writing
[8330.16 --> 8330.98]  that's a better
[8330.98 --> 8331.74]  type of question
[8331.74 --> 8332.50]  for something like
[8332.50 --> 8333.20]  the new builds
[8333.20 --> 8333.84]  and planning section
[8333.84 --> 8334.32]  of the forum
[8334.32 --> 8336.40]  um so you can
[8336.40 --> 8337.16]  get way more
[8337.16 --> 8338.40]  into into depth
[8338.40 --> 8339.28]  with it but
[8339.28 --> 8341.32]  planning a build
[8341.32 --> 8342.36]  for future proofing
[8342.36 --> 8343.38]  is often a flawed
[8343.38 --> 8344.10]  way of approaching
[8344.10 --> 8344.80]  the build in my
[8344.80 --> 8346.30]  opinion um so
[8346.30 --> 8346.82]  answering that
[8346.82 --> 8347.34]  question is just
[8347.34 --> 8347.78]  kind of like
[8347.78 --> 8349.50]  yeah it's tough
[8349.50 --> 8349.96]  yeah
[8349.96 --> 8352.90]  next question here
[8352.90 --> 8353.92]  is from tyler
[8353.92 --> 8355.00]  i liked hearing
[8355.00 --> 8355.82]  about canadian
[8355.82 --> 8356.40]  versus chinese
[8356.40 --> 8357.02]  molding in your
[8357.02 --> 8357.88]  screwdriver supply
[8357.88 --> 8358.56]  chain and would
[8358.56 --> 8359.16]  love to hear more
[8359.16 --> 8360.32]  about this on
[8360.32 --> 8360.94]  everything on the
[8360.94 --> 8362.04]  ltt store what
[8362.04 --> 8362.58]  are some challenges
[8362.58 --> 8363.16]  you faced with
[8363.16 --> 8363.68]  finding north
[8363.68 --> 8364.28]  american base
[8364.28 --> 8364.88]  suppliers for
[8364.88 --> 8365.62]  your products
[8365.62 --> 8366.26]  so i wanted to
[8366.26 --> 8366.96]  use this opportunity
[8366.96 --> 8367.90]  to blast the
[8367.90 --> 8368.56]  newsletter
[8368.56 --> 8370.04]  yeah
[8370.04 --> 8370.60]  creator warehouse
[8370.60 --> 8371.22]  has a newsletter
[8371.22 --> 8371.88]  where they talk
[8371.88 --> 8372.48]  about this type
[8372.48 --> 8372.90]  of stuff
[8372.90 --> 8374.10]  yeah not as
[8374.10 --> 8374.66]  often as i'd
[8374.66 --> 8375.34]  like but they're
[8375.34 --> 8375.92]  working on it
[8375.92 --> 8376.68]  there's some
[8376.68 --> 8377.16]  there's some
[8377.16 --> 8377.76]  really interesting
[8377.76 --> 8378.82]  articles on there
[8378.82 --> 8379.32]  and there's an
[8379.32 --> 8380.12]  archive on the
[8380.12 --> 8381.66]  website um i
[8381.66 --> 8382.52]  don't actually know
[8382.52 --> 8383.20]  where the archive
[8383.20 --> 8383.96]  is on our
[8383.96 --> 8384.78]  current site because
[8384.78 --> 8385.36]  i know where it
[8385.36 --> 8386.06]  is on the new
[8386.06 --> 8386.82]  theme that's coming
[8386.82 --> 8387.82]  oh bloody hell
[8387.82 --> 8389.18]  um okay well
[8389.18 --> 8389.78]  yeah i don't
[8389.78 --> 8390.24]  but there will be
[8390.24 --> 8390.90]  an archive on the
[8390.90 --> 8391.60]  new theme i'm
[8391.60 --> 8392.18]  pretty sure there
[8392.18 --> 8392.90]  is one that you
[8392.90 --> 8393.88]  can find on the
[8393.88 --> 8394.38]  current theme i
[8394.38 --> 8394.74]  just don't know
[8394.74 --> 8395.22]  where it is i
[8395.22 --> 8395.94]  do not see it
[8395.94 --> 8396.74]  okay okay
[8396.74 --> 8398.08]  yeah uh
[8398.08 --> 8400.00]  anyway um i
[8400.00 --> 8401.14]  would say i don't
[8401.14 --> 8401.72]  know i can talk
[8401.72 --> 8402.10]  about a couple
[8402.10 --> 8403.98]  things so uh
[8403.98 --> 8405.48]  when the when
[8405.48 --> 8406.40]  the covid shutdowns
[8406.40 --> 8406.94]  were hitting china
[8406.94 --> 8408.12]  really hard near the
[8408.12 --> 8409.32]  beginning of what
[8409.32 --> 8409.90]  would it be like
[8409.90 --> 8410.72]  like maybe mid
[8410.72 --> 8411.84]  2020 let's say
[8411.84 --> 8413.16]  uh mid to late
[8413.16 --> 8415.76]  2020 we explored
[8415.76 --> 8417.28]  heavily getting
[8417.28 --> 8418.88]  garments made here
[8418.88 --> 8420.34]  in canada and
[8420.34 --> 8421.50]  what we ultimately
[8421.50 --> 8422.66]  discovered was
[8422.66 --> 8423.98]  that there was
[8423.98 --> 8425.46]  no stock of
[8425.46 --> 8427.34]  anything so you
[8427.34 --> 8428.32]  would pretty much
[8428.32 --> 8429.62]  have to wait for
[8429.62 --> 8430.70]  whatever fabric
[8430.70 --> 8432.02]  supplier to order
[8432.02 --> 8433.76]  from china so it
[8433.76 --> 8434.18]  wasn't going to
[8434.18 --> 8435.34]  help us smooth out
[8435.34 --> 8437.44]  our um our
[8437.44 --> 8438.56]  procurement issues
[8438.56 --> 8439.68]  and then the
[8439.68 --> 8441.08]  second problem was
[8441.08 --> 8442.50]  that the quality of
[8442.50 --> 8443.56]  the actual production
[8443.56 --> 8444.94]  over here was
[8444.94 --> 8446.62]  just not even
[8446.62 --> 8448.10]  close just
[8448.10 --> 8450.76]  like pockets
[8450.76 --> 8451.54]  like this
[8451.54 --> 8452.28]  crooked like
[8452.28 --> 8453.04]  just oh like
[8453.04 --> 8454.14]  it was utterly
[8454.14 --> 8455.30]  unusable we we
[8455.30 --> 8455.94]  explored doing
[8455.94 --> 8456.96]  like a whole line
[8456.96 --> 8457.98]  like made in
[8457.98 --> 8458.70]  canada line
[8458.70 --> 8460.68]  and um
[8460.68 --> 8462.40]  it's not i'm not
[8462.40 --> 8463.28]  saying that nothing
[8463.28 --> 8464.02]  made in canada
[8464.02 --> 8464.64]  would be good
[8464.64 --> 8466.12]  i'm saying that
[8466.12 --> 8467.38]  whatever manufacturing
[8467.38 --> 8468.52]  capacity there is
[8468.52 --> 8469.46]  in canada is
[8469.46 --> 8470.62]  probably privately
[8470.62 --> 8472.04]  held right and
[8472.04 --> 8473.22]  privately utilized
[8473.22 --> 8474.86]  and or is
[8474.86 --> 8476.90]  pretty bottom tier
[8476.90 --> 8480.30]  um or is or is
[8480.30 --> 8481.80]  being used
[8481.80 --> 8482.96]  um like a lot
[8482.96 --> 8483.38]  of it would be
[8483.38 --> 8484.14]  like short run
[8484.14 --> 8485.20]  types of projects
[8485.20 --> 8486.26]  like if you need
[8486.26 --> 8487.16]  to you you have
[8487.16 --> 8488.12]  a conference in
[8488.12 --> 8489.74]  two months and
[8489.74 --> 8490.92]  you need uh
[8490.92 --> 8491.56]  jackets for all
[8491.56 --> 8492.18]  your team members
[8492.18 --> 8492.68]  you might get
[8492.68 --> 8493.30]  something like that
[8493.30 --> 8494.42]  done here and
[8494.42 --> 8496.14]  so the the the
[8496.14 --> 8496.90]  standards for
[8496.90 --> 8497.92]  quality might not
[8497.92 --> 8499.10]  be as high but
[8499.10 --> 8499.60]  that might not
[8499.60 --> 8500.56]  matter or they
[8500.56 --> 8501.10]  might be really
[8501.10 --> 8501.78]  high and you
[8501.78 --> 8502.30]  might be paying
[8502.30 --> 8503.04]  like nine hundred
[8503.04 --> 8503.70]  dollars a jacket
[8503.70 --> 8504.32]  or whatever and
[8504.32 --> 8504.86]  that's not something
[8504.86 --> 8505.50]  that we'd be able
[8505.50 --> 8506.80]  to market to
[8506.80 --> 8507.38]  you guys you
[8507.38 --> 8507.88]  don't you're not
[8507.88 --> 8508.44]  gonna you're not
[8508.44 --> 8509.04]  gonna pay that
[8509.04 --> 8510.34]  and to be clear i
[8510.34 --> 8510.86]  pulled that number
[8510.86 --> 8511.46]  out of my butt it
[8511.46 --> 8511.86]  could be a lot
[8511.86 --> 8512.60]  never say never
[8512.60 --> 8514.32]  maybe there's you
[8514.32 --> 8515.26]  know double digit
[8515.26 --> 8516.90]  inflation for a
[8516.90 --> 8517.60]  bunch of years or
[8517.60 --> 8518.30]  something and jack
[8518.30 --> 8518.88]  is start costing
[8518.88 --> 8519.52]  nine hundred dollars
[8519.52 --> 8521.22]  uh yeah sure but
[8521.22 --> 8523.70]  like i'd yeah
[8523.70 --> 8525.60]  yeah um there's
[8525.60 --> 8526.14]  another thing we
[8526.14 --> 8526.68]  tried to get done
[8526.68 --> 8527.22]  in canada we
[8527.22 --> 8527.70]  tried to get the
[8527.70 --> 8528.38]  abcs of gaming
[8528.38 --> 8529.14]  printed in canada
[8529.14 --> 8531.34]  and literally
[8531.34 --> 8532.80]  every single
[8532.80 --> 8534.02]  so-called
[8534.02 --> 8535.48]  printer in canada
[8535.48 --> 8536.46]  was just
[8536.46 --> 8537.44]  outsourcing to
[8537.44 --> 8538.14]  china anyway
[8538.14 --> 8541.06]  so we were like
[8541.06 --> 8541.80]  um okay
[8541.80 --> 8543.48]  and we sourced it
[8543.48 --> 8544.28]  from china and
[8544.28 --> 8545.02]  the quality is
[8545.02 --> 8546.16]  great and
[8546.16 --> 8548.46]  like we get so
[8548.46 --> 8549.34]  many reviews on
[8549.34 --> 8550.00]  the site about
[8550.00 --> 8551.20]  how amazing the
[8551.20 --> 8552.22]  quality of abcs of
[8552.22 --> 8552.84]  gaming is like
[8552.84 --> 8553.38]  compared to their
[8553.38 --> 8554.10]  other board books
[8554.10 --> 8555.30]  and it's like yeah
[8555.30 --> 8556.00]  because we just
[8556.00 --> 8556.70]  like found and
[8556.70 --> 8557.44]  validated a good
[8557.44 --> 8558.52]  chinese factory and
[8558.52 --> 8559.12]  that like that's
[8559.12 --> 8559.82]  the thing in china
[8559.82 --> 8560.70]  as it was really
[8560.70 --> 8561.76]  eye-opening to hear
[8561.76 --> 8562.54]  the molding guys
[8562.54 --> 8563.42]  talk about it where
[8563.42 --> 8566.06]  in china um you
[8566.06 --> 8567.50]  can absolutely pay
[8567.50 --> 8568.26]  the exact same
[8568.26 --> 8568.76]  amount that you
[8568.76 --> 8569.70]  would pay here and
[8569.70 --> 8570.82]  get a great quality
[8570.82 --> 8571.54]  product like you
[8571.54 --> 8573.24]  might get here um
[8573.24 --> 8575.48]  or you can tell
[8575.48 --> 8576.22]  them look i only want
[8576.22 --> 8576.90]  to pay a quarter as
[8576.90 --> 8577.44]  much and they will
[8577.44 --> 8578.12]  yeah they'll happily
[8578.12 --> 8578.80]  make something for
[8578.80 --> 8579.28]  you that's a quarter
[8579.28 --> 8579.78]  of the quality
[8579.78 --> 8583.72]  makes sense so
[8583.72 --> 8585.30]  this perception that
[8585.30 --> 8586.44]  chinese manufacturing
[8586.44 --> 8587.28]  is like
[8587.28 --> 8589.30]  here and bad
[8589.30 --> 8590.86]  quality a lot of
[8590.86 --> 8592.12]  it not all but a
[8592.12 --> 8593.24]  lot of it has to
[8593.24 --> 8595.24]  do with companies
[8595.24 --> 8596.58]  over here wanting
[8596.58 --> 8597.32]  to pay a very
[8597.32 --> 8598.34]  wanting to pay a
[8598.34 --> 8599.22]  small amount of
[8599.22 --> 8600.14]  money and ending
[8600.14 --> 8601.44]  up with a
[8601.44 --> 8602.68]  here product like
[8602.68 --> 8603.44]  it's it makes
[8603.44 --> 8604.56]  sense yeah
[8604.56 --> 8606.70]  yeah hilarious
[8606.70 --> 8609.08]  next question here
[8609.08 --> 8609.74]  is from carson
[8609.74 --> 8610.72]  what's your opinion
[8610.72 --> 8611.60]  on the new psu
[8611.60 --> 8612.10]  spec and the
[8612.10 --> 8612.82]  necessity of it
[8612.82 --> 8613.44]  it sucks for people
[8613.44 --> 8614.08]  like me who just
[8614.08 --> 8614.44]  bought a nicer
[8614.44 --> 8615.32]  psu hoping it would
[8615.32 --> 8616.36]  last long but now
[8616.36 --> 8617.18]  according to jc
[8617.18 --> 8617.82]  sense there are
[8617.82 --> 8618.72]  risks with mixing
[8618.72 --> 8619.80]  an old psu with a
[8619.80 --> 8621.00]  new gpu and that's
[8621.00 --> 8621.76]  why future proofing
[8621.76 --> 8625.74]  sucks i mean if you
[8625.74 --> 8626.54]  bought a thousand
[8626.54 --> 8627.74]  watt power supply back
[8627.74 --> 8630.42]  in like 2005 2006
[8630.42 --> 8631.68]  actually i don't think
[8631.68 --> 8632.46]  they had really hit by
[8632.46 --> 8633.16]  that point let's say
[8633.16 --> 8635.06]  2008 you got a solid
[8635.06 --> 8636.30]  14 years out of it
[8636.30 --> 8637.98]  you sure did and
[8637.98 --> 8638.62]  that's still why
[8638.62 --> 8639.50]  future proofing sucks
[8639.50 --> 8640.22]  but you were lucky
[8640.22 --> 8641.52]  yeah exactly you
[8641.52 --> 8642.36]  didn't like know if
[8642.36 --> 8643.04]  that was going to be a
[8643.04 --> 8644.32]  thing or not uh
[8644.32 --> 8648.68]  yeah yeah um we
[8648.68 --> 8649.52]  haven't done a video
[8649.52 --> 8651.34]  about atx 3.0 yet so
[8651.34 --> 8651.90]  the truth of the
[8651.90 --> 8652.54]  matter is i haven't
[8652.54 --> 8653.42]  really looked into it
[8653.42 --> 8655.36]  that much i know that
[8655.36 --> 8656.70]  we want to get our
[8656.70 --> 8657.82]  chroma set up so that
[8657.82 --> 8659.14]  we can evaluate atx
[8659.14 --> 8660.34]  3.0 power supplies i
[8660.34 --> 8661.20]  know the first ones
[8661.20 --> 8661.96]  have hit the market
[8661.96 --> 8663.40]  now silverstone has
[8663.40 --> 8664.06]  one that's available
[8664.06 --> 8665.80]  for purchase now but
[8665.80 --> 8666.82]  we have not gotten our
[8666.82 --> 8667.52]  training from chroma
[8667.52 --> 8668.20]  yet so we're not
[8668.20 --> 8669.14]  quite ready to
[8669.14 --> 8670.14]  evaluate power supplies
[8670.14 --> 8671.00]  but it will come very
[8671.00 --> 8672.78]  soon i skimmed
[8672.78 --> 8673.88]  jay's video on it
[8673.88 --> 8674.70]  sorry jay i was
[8674.70 --> 8675.50]  busy i didn't have
[8675.50 --> 8676.52]  time to really sit
[8676.52 --> 8677.06]  down and dedicate
[8677.06 --> 8677.94]  watch time to it but
[8677.94 --> 8680.88]  it's interesting it's
[8680.88 --> 8682.14]  very interesting i'm
[8682.14 --> 8683.78]  excited to see like lab
[8683.78 --> 8685.18]  data on it whatever i'm
[8685.18 --> 8685.90]  excited to see people
[8685.90 --> 8687.82]  dive deeply into it but
[8687.82 --> 8688.54]  check out jay's video
[8688.54 --> 8689.26]  it's interesting
[8689.26 --> 8692.36]  next question here from
[8692.36 --> 8693.46]  anon did you ever
[8693.46 --> 8694.62]  ever get a resolution to
[8694.62 --> 8695.46]  the wire fraud from
[8695.46 --> 8696.40]  earlier this year hoping
[8696.40 --> 8697.28]  that got sorted for you
[8697.28 --> 8698.18]  yeah we got it back
[8698.18 --> 8700.18]  through very um
[8700.18 --> 8702.58]  unofficial means
[8702.58 --> 8704.98]  i told the story
[8704.98 --> 8705.72]  before i think it's on
[8705.72 --> 8706.26]  lmg clips
[8706.26 --> 8709.44]  next question here from
[8709.44 --> 8710.54]  everett do you ever
[8710.54 --> 8711.54]  think we'll get reach a
[8711.54 --> 8712.44]  point of smaller and
[8712.44 --> 8713.80]  smaller transistor sizes
[8713.80 --> 8714.92]  that quantum tunneling
[8714.92 --> 8715.86]  will stop shrinking and
[8715.86 --> 8716.64]  we'll have to rely on what
[8716.64 --> 8717.78]  amd is doing with 3d
[8717.78 --> 8718.18]  stacking
[8718.18 --> 8719.10]  yeah we're already there
[8719.10 --> 8720.44]  that's why amd is 3d
[8720.44 --> 8720.78]  stacking
[8720.78 --> 8722.94]  yeah it's the writing's
[8722.94 --> 8723.88]  been on the wall for a
[8723.88 --> 8724.86]  long time that's why
[8724.86 --> 8725.44]  they've been developing
[8725.44 --> 8726.12]  these technologies
[8726.12 --> 8726.72]  absolutely
[8726.72 --> 8729.22]  oops sorry are we
[8729.22 --> 8729.74]  playing footsie
[8729.74 --> 8730.74]  i'm down let's do it
[8730.74 --> 8732.04]  i'm gonna try to reach
[8732.04 --> 8733.04]  really far so i can
[8733.04 --> 8733.46]  join it
[8733.46 --> 8736.94]  next question here is
[8736.94 --> 8738.62]  from raul uh in the
[8738.62 --> 8739.72]  foreseeable future will
[8739.72 --> 8740.82]  ltt store ever become a
[8740.82 --> 8741.94]  hub for selling other
[8741.94 --> 8743.24]  youtubers merch after the
[8743.24 --> 8744.16]  jerry rig everything knife
[8744.16 --> 8745.26]  i was started to wonder
[8745.26 --> 8749.18]  um i don't see why not
[8749.18 --> 8750.52]  any other creators y'all
[8750.52 --> 8751.30]  out there you wanna
[8751.30 --> 8753.44]  wanna like wholesale some
[8753.44 --> 8754.88]  stuff to us if we think
[8754.88 --> 8756.18]  it's a good product like i
[8756.18 --> 8757.00]  don't see why we wouldn't
[8757.00 --> 8757.48]  carry it
[8757.48 --> 8759.02]  i don't know man it's
[8759.02 --> 8759.72]  like should we just have
[8759.72 --> 8760.44]  like creator warehouse
[8760.44 --> 8761.58]  dot com and like
[8761.58 --> 8764.64]  i've been wanting
[8764.64 --> 8765.90]  creator warehouse to
[8765.90 --> 8767.84]  support other creators
[8767.84 --> 8769.26]  for a long time the way
[8769.26 --> 8770.58]  that i want them to do it
[8770.58 --> 8771.76]  is not in that way and i
[8771.76 --> 8772.86]  understand it's super hard
[8772.86 --> 8773.54]  i get it
[8773.54 --> 8775.46]  oh like develop products
[8775.46 --> 8775.86]  for them
[8775.86 --> 8776.14]  yeah
[8776.14 --> 8778.80]  i know i know you know
[8778.80 --> 8779.52]  we are working with
[8779.52 --> 8780.48]  someone big though right
[8780.48 --> 8781.30]  no
[8781.30 --> 8783.36]  yeah really big
[8783.36 --> 8783.96]  i didn't
[8783.96 --> 8785.06]  but it's gonna take time
[8785.06 --> 8786.82]  yeah and it's hard and
[8786.82 --> 8788.28]  it takes upfront investment
[8788.28 --> 8789.40]  because the way that we do
[8789.40 --> 8789.62]  it
[8789.62 --> 8791.28]  is a little different
[8791.28 --> 8793.14]  even from that person
[8793.14 --> 8793.74]  it is
[8793.74 --> 8795.40]  it is requiring a
[8795.40 --> 8796.50]  significant time
[8796.50 --> 8797.28]  commitment but
[8797.28 --> 8798.38]  this person
[8798.38 --> 8799.72]  has a lot of
[8799.72 --> 8800.12]  integrity
[8800.12 --> 8801.78]  and cares about the
[8801.78 --> 8803.00]  quality of the products
[8803.00 --> 8803.62]  that they
[8803.62 --> 8804.16]  want to
[8804.16 --> 8805.28]  they don't just want to
[8805.28 --> 8805.88]  sell stuff
[8805.88 --> 8806.92]  to their audience
[8806.92 --> 8808.20]  the thing that i've liked
[8808.20 --> 8809.10]  about the store the most
[8809.10 --> 8810.52]  the whole time we've had it
[8810.52 --> 8810.74]  but
[8810.74 --> 8811.36]  more
[8811.36 --> 8812.44]  lately because like
[8812.44 --> 8813.44]  originally we were just
[8813.44 --> 8814.58]  doing like what we could
[8814.58 --> 8816.08]  and now we can do more
[8816.08 --> 8816.98]  which is great
[8816.98 --> 8817.90]  but the thing that i've
[8817.90 --> 8818.64]  liked about the store is
[8818.64 --> 8818.94]  that i
[8818.94 --> 8821.80]  i feel stoked to stand
[8821.80 --> 8822.50]  behind our products
[8822.50 --> 8823.30]  which is cool
[8823.30 --> 8825.14]  i think we make good stuff
[8825.14 --> 8826.74]  a lot of youtuber merch
[8826.74 --> 8828.02]  even well-intentioned
[8828.02 --> 8828.58]  youtuber merch
[8828.58 --> 8828.90]  yeah
[8828.90 --> 8830.88]  is kind of junky
[8830.88 --> 8832.16]  because
[8832.16 --> 8834.40]  you do what you're
[8834.40 --> 8835.10]  supposed to do right
[8835.10 --> 8835.86]  you look online
[8835.86 --> 8836.96]  look at what other
[8836.96 --> 8837.58]  people are doing
[8837.58 --> 8838.50]  this is what's available
[8838.50 --> 8838.96]  to me
[8838.96 --> 8840.24]  this is all i can really
[8840.24 --> 8840.74]  do without
[8840.74 --> 8842.20]  building a business arm
[8842.20 --> 8843.32]  which is not realistic
[8843.32 --> 8844.16]  for most creators
[8844.16 --> 8845.10]  which is fine
[8845.10 --> 8845.70]  and makes sense
[8845.70 --> 8847.10]  and those results
[8847.10 --> 8848.98]  are often kind of junky
[8848.98 --> 8849.26]  yeah
[8849.26 --> 8850.82]  so being able to have
[8850.82 --> 8851.70]  actually good stuff
[8851.70 --> 8852.22]  is cool
[8852.22 --> 8853.06]  but it's hard
[8853.06 --> 8854.82]  and having the creator
[8854.82 --> 8855.38]  warehouse team
[8855.38 --> 8856.96]  be able to be that arm
[8856.96 --> 8857.78]  for these other companies
[8857.78 --> 8858.80]  i think would be really sick
[8858.80 --> 8859.62]  but again
[8859.62 --> 8861.50]  that itself is really difficult
[8861.50 --> 8862.48]  and we're already dealing
[8862.48 --> 8864.24]  with our own scale things
[8864.24 --> 8865.16]  and there's lots of work to do
[8865.16 --> 8865.44]  so
[8865.44 --> 8865.78]  yeah
[8865.78 --> 8866.60]  and it's tough right
[8866.60 --> 8867.34]  because like
[8867.34 --> 8868.50]  it works for us
[8868.50 --> 8869.60]  because we are taking
[8869.60 --> 8871.16]  100% of the margin
[8871.16 --> 8873.26]  if we had another creator
[8873.26 --> 8873.82]  come in
[8873.82 --> 8874.30]  and say
[8874.30 --> 8875.22]  yeah
[8875.22 --> 8876.12]  i uh
[8876.12 --> 8876.98]  i want to do
[8876.98 --> 8877.50]  uh
[8877.50 --> 8878.88]  uh
[8878.88 --> 8880.18]  a purse
[8880.18 --> 8881.00]  okay
[8881.00 --> 8881.90]  so whatever
[8881.90 --> 8882.18]  right
[8882.18 --> 8883.14]  it's like some product
[8883.14 --> 8885.04]  so let's say
[8885.04 --> 8886.16]  that uh
[8886.16 --> 8886.56]  they
[8886.56 --> 8888.20]  they wanted to target
[8888.20 --> 8889.16]  um
[8889.16 --> 8890.90]  like a pretty typical
[8890.90 --> 8892.18]  retail product markup
[8892.18 --> 8892.74]  is about
[8892.74 --> 8893.42]  double
[8893.42 --> 8893.98]  okay
[8893.98 --> 8894.36]  so
[8894.36 --> 8895.84]  let's say they wanted to target
[8895.84 --> 8896.62]  uh
[8896.62 --> 8897.38]  a 199
[8897.38 --> 8898.50]  price point
[8898.50 --> 8899.56]  okay
[8899.56 --> 8900.44]  so
[8900.44 --> 8902.36]  if it was for us
[8902.36 --> 8903.36]  we have
[8903.36 --> 8904.40]  a hundred dollars
[8904.40 --> 8905.22]  to work with
[8905.22 --> 8905.74]  to
[8905.74 --> 8906.36]  to
[8906.36 --> 8908.00]  to build that product
[8908.00 --> 8909.12]  um
[8909.12 --> 8909.78]  while
[8909.78 --> 8911.46]  because you got to understand
[8911.46 --> 8912.28]  there are certain
[8912.28 --> 8914.28]  costs associated with a product
[8914.28 --> 8915.86]  that just scale with price
[8915.86 --> 8916.16]  so
[8916.16 --> 8916.86]  you know
[8916.86 --> 8917.12]  any
[8917.12 --> 8917.98]  any losses
[8917.98 --> 8919.16]  from warranty
[8919.16 --> 8919.98]  for example
[8919.98 --> 8920.88]  it's not like
[8920.88 --> 8921.30]  um
[8921.30 --> 8922.20]  it's not like just because
[8922.20 --> 8923.40]  it's a more expensive product
[8923.40 --> 8924.16]  you can just
[8924.16 --> 8925.34]  you can just make
[8925.34 --> 8926.48]  a maximum of twenty dollars
[8926.48 --> 8927.14]  on every product
[8927.14 --> 8929.24]  no matter how much it actually costs
[8929.24 --> 8929.88]  um
[8929.88 --> 8931.36]  there's also higher transaction fees
[8931.36 --> 8932.08]  on the transaction
[8932.08 --> 8932.80]  like there's just
[8932.80 --> 8934.18]  there's just fixed costs
[8934.18 --> 8934.54]  that
[8934.54 --> 8935.30]  that go up
[8935.30 --> 8936.40]  with the value of the product
[8936.40 --> 8936.90]  and so it's
[8936.90 --> 8938.00]  it's pretty typical
[8938.00 --> 8940.02]  to aim for about
[8940.02 --> 8940.80]  a hundred points
[8940.80 --> 8941.44]  on
[8941.44 --> 8942.28]  on a product
[8942.28 --> 8943.40]  and so
[8943.40 --> 8943.94]  if
[8943.94 --> 8945.14]  we were
[8945.14 --> 8946.50]  operating as
[8946.50 --> 8947.12]  just this
[8947.12 --> 8947.60]  single
[8947.60 --> 8948.88]  vertically integrated entity
[8948.88 --> 8949.82]  like we are now
[8949.82 --> 8951.24]  then we could kind of go
[8951.24 --> 8951.66]  okay
[8951.66 --> 8952.40]  well
[8952.40 --> 8952.96]  then
[8952.96 --> 8954.20]  we have a hundred dollars
[8954.20 --> 8954.84]  to work with
[8954.84 --> 8955.88]  to develop this product
[8955.88 --> 8957.14]  and we will
[8957.14 --> 8958.24]  make a hundred dollars
[8958.24 --> 8958.56]  on it
[8958.56 --> 8959.06]  this is all
[8959.06 --> 8959.98]  purely hypothetical
[8959.98 --> 8961.40]  and I've used these
[8961.40 --> 8961.86]  simple
[8961.86 --> 8962.78]  uh
[8962.78 --> 8964.10]  one to two ratios
[8964.10 --> 8965.08]  before for cost
[8965.08 --> 8966.42]  to retail price
[8966.42 --> 8968.02]  it's not always
[8968.02 --> 8968.56]  that simple
[8968.56 --> 8969.12]  we have products
[8969.12 --> 8969.92]  we make more than that
[8969.92 --> 8970.40]  we have products
[8970.40 --> 8971.64]  we make less than that
[8971.64 --> 8972.54]  and
[8972.54 --> 8973.26]  um
[8973.26 --> 8975.02]  that also helps us
[8975.02 --> 8975.90]  absorb the
[8975.90 --> 8976.54]  storage
[8976.54 --> 8977.78]  and handling
[8977.78 --> 8978.98]  and transaction fees
[8978.98 --> 8979.90]  and like all that stuff
[8979.90 --> 8980.42]  but
[8980.42 --> 8981.44]  we're keeping the math
[8981.44 --> 8982.02]  really
[8982.02 --> 8982.92]  really simple
[8982.92 --> 8984.38]  so
[8984.38 --> 8985.26]  all of a sudden
[8985.26 --> 8986.44]  we are not acting
[8986.44 --> 8986.96]  as a vertically
[8986.96 --> 8987.94]  integrated company
[8987.94 --> 8988.80]  where the creator
[8988.80 --> 8989.88]  and the creating
[8989.88 --> 8990.66]  company
[8990.66 --> 8991.00]  are
[8991.00 --> 8991.30]  are
[8991.30 --> 8991.80]  are one
[8991.80 --> 8992.30]  essentially
[8992.30 --> 8993.54]  now we're creator
[8993.54 --> 8993.92]  warehouse
[8993.92 --> 8994.54]  and we're working
[8994.54 --> 8995.42]  with another
[8995.42 --> 8996.70]  person
[8996.70 --> 8997.68]  okay
[8997.68 --> 8998.68]  so of that
[8998.68 --> 8999.56]  hundred dollars
[8999.56 --> 9000.58]  what's that split
[9000.58 --> 9001.68]  um
[9001.68 --> 9002.56]  if
[9002.56 --> 9003.58]  if it's 90-10
[9003.58 --> 9004.66]  if they take 90 of it
[9004.66 --> 9005.30]  and we take 10
[9005.30 --> 9006.02]  that sounds pretty good
[9006.02 --> 9006.40]  for them
[9006.40 --> 9007.00]  because they don't have to
[9007.00 --> 9008.18]  like build a business arm
[9008.18 --> 9008.78]  like you said
[9008.78 --> 9009.70]  to create these products
[9009.70 --> 9010.86]  but is that even worth
[9010.86 --> 9011.40]  our time
[9011.40 --> 9012.76]  if we're selling these
[9012.76 --> 9014.44]  two hundred dollar products
[9014.44 --> 9015.70]  and we're taking home
[9015.70 --> 9016.44]  ten dollars
[9016.44 --> 9017.40]  of that hundred dollars
[9017.40 --> 9017.88]  of margin
[9017.88 --> 9020.82]  why did we even bother
[9020.82 --> 9021.44]  unless we
[9021.44 --> 9022.86]  unless we are going to sell
[9022.86 --> 9023.48]  like
[9023.48 --> 9025.02]  a hundred thousand
[9025.02 --> 9025.48]  of them
[9025.48 --> 9026.04]  or something
[9026.04 --> 9027.38]  um
[9027.38 --> 9028.54]  the
[9028.54 --> 9029.04]  the
[9029.04 --> 9029.38]  the
[9029.38 --> 9029.66]  the
[9029.66 --> 9030.90]  the multiple people
[9030.90 --> 9031.42]  that are probably
[9031.42 --> 9032.16]  because any product
[9032.16 --> 9032.62]  you're going to sell
[9032.62 --> 9033.22]  that many of
[9033.22 --> 9034.48]  I guarantee you
[9034.48 --> 9035.36]  the development costs
[9035.36 --> 9036.18]  were substantial
[9036.18 --> 9037.60]  well into six figures
[9037.60 --> 9038.44]  but I think
[9038.44 --> 9038.78]  I think
[9038.78 --> 9039.50]  why are we bothering
[9039.50 --> 9040.78]  so a lot of what I would
[9040.78 --> 9041.32]  I guess
[9041.32 --> 9041.86]  bring up
[9041.86 --> 9042.46]  is that
[9042.46 --> 9043.34]  the thing that I like
[9043.34 --> 9044.50]  the most about our stuff
[9044.50 --> 9045.34]  is the
[9045.34 --> 9047.08]  quality of it
[9047.08 --> 9048.54]  but that's exactly it
[9048.54 --> 9049.06]  and maybe
[9049.06 --> 9049.98]  I was getting there
[9049.98 --> 9050.72]  hold on
[9050.72 --> 9051.44]  I was going to get there
[9051.44 --> 9051.96]  hold on
[9051.96 --> 9052.86]  I was going to get there
[9052.86 --> 9053.38]  hold on
[9053.38 --> 9056.28]  maybe we don't do purses
[9056.28 --> 9057.78]  well okay
[9057.78 --> 9058.48]  but we have our own
[9058.48 --> 9059.32]  blanks for shirts
[9059.32 --> 9060.40]  and we have consistent
[9060.40 --> 9061.24]  really high quality
[9061.24 --> 9062.48]  and the printing's good
[9062.48 --> 9063.80]  and we have bottles
[9063.80 --> 9065.08]  and we have other stuff
[9065.08 --> 9065.34]  okay
[9065.34 --> 9065.90]  but hold on
[9065.90 --> 9066.60]  let's go back to
[9066.60 --> 9067.42]  let's go back to
[9067.42 --> 9068.74]  the margin question then
[9068.74 --> 9069.20]  okay
[9069.20 --> 9069.54]  so
[9069.54 --> 9070.80]  so we have to figure out
[9070.80 --> 9072.36]  that it has to be enough margin
[9072.36 --> 9073.36]  for us to get out of bed
[9073.36 --> 9074.34]  because otherwise
[9074.34 --> 9075.42]  we could have made our own purse
[9075.42 --> 9075.82]  yeah
[9075.82 --> 9076.32]  right
[9076.32 --> 9077.50]  okay
[9077.50 --> 9078.52]  so then
[9078.52 --> 9079.76]  we need more
[9079.76 --> 9081.00]  than 10% probably
[9081.00 --> 9082.58]  so then from their side
[9082.58 --> 9084.22]  okay well
[9084.22 --> 9085.80]  it has to be enough
[9085.80 --> 9086.58]  for me to bother
[9086.58 --> 9087.16]  getting out of bed
[9087.16 --> 9088.16]  because at the end of the day
[9088.16 --> 9089.34]  I'm the one who has to be involved
[9089.34 --> 9090.62]  in the design process for this
[9090.62 --> 9091.68]  I have to sell it
[9091.68 --> 9093.18]  it has my name on it
[9093.18 --> 9094.50]  and ultimately reflects on me
[9094.50 --> 9095.22]  if it's bad
[9095.22 --> 9096.66]  so they're taking a lot of
[9096.66 --> 9097.70]  they're taking a lot of
[9097.70 --> 9098.52]  inherent risk
[9098.52 --> 9098.84]  in
[9098.84 --> 9099.24]  in
[9099.24 --> 9100.26]  undertaking this
[9100.26 --> 9101.40]  so we might go
[9101.40 --> 9102.16]  okay fine
[9102.16 --> 9102.76]  um
[9102.76 --> 9104.40]  a hundred dollars
[9104.40 --> 9105.50]  isn't enough for us to split
[9105.50 --> 9106.88]  so now the final price
[9106.88 --> 9107.80]  needs to be
[9107.80 --> 9109.40]  250 bucks
[9109.40 --> 9110.80]  so we each get 75
[9110.80 --> 9111.70]  and now we're happy
[9111.70 --> 9112.90]  hypothetically
[9112.90 --> 9113.26]  right
[9113.26 --> 9115.30]  so we're both making less
[9115.30 --> 9117.02]  the price went up to you
[9117.02 --> 9119.64]  by involving these multiple entities
[9119.64 --> 9120.62]  now
[9120.62 --> 9121.24]  it doesn't
[9121.24 --> 9124.38]  I know people are going to be like
[9124.38 --> 9124.64]  um
[9124.64 --> 9125.42]  it doesn't work like that
[9125.42 --> 9125.94]  you're right
[9125.94 --> 9126.28]  you're right
[9126.28 --> 9126.56]  you're right
[9126.56 --> 9127.50]  that's not how it works
[9127.50 --> 9128.34]  but the point is that
[9128.34 --> 9130.82]  the more entities involved
[9130.82 --> 9131.96]  in this process
[9131.96 --> 9133.94]  the more ways that
[9133.94 --> 9135.96]  whatever margin there is
[9135.96 --> 9136.64]  is split
[9136.64 --> 9138.38]  and the more it drives up
[9138.38 --> 9139.30]  the finished cost
[9139.30 --> 9140.86]  and so you know
[9140.86 --> 9141.64]  from my point of view
[9141.64 --> 9142.38]  and you guys might think
[9142.38 --> 9143.06]  oh you're being greedy
[9143.06 --> 9144.06]  10% should be lots
[9144.06 --> 9144.56]  right well okay
[9144.56 --> 9145.94]  well who's doing customer support
[9145.94 --> 9148.40]  am I handling that
[9148.40 --> 9150.14]  no
[9150.14 --> 9151.06]  why not
[9151.06 --> 9151.54]  not
[9151.54 --> 9152.16]  not in the way
[9152.16 --> 9152.38]  that I'm thinking
[9152.38 --> 9152.90]  because they don't want to build
[9152.90 --> 9153.48]  a business arm
[9153.48 --> 9154.24]  right
[9154.24 --> 9156.10]  if they don't want to build
[9156.10 --> 9156.76]  a business arm
[9156.76 --> 9158.24]  well then why are they doing support
[9158.24 --> 9159.50]  well we should be a one stop shop
[9159.50 --> 9160.66]  okay well then I need more margin
[9160.66 --> 9161.60]  because
[9161.60 --> 9163.32]  so we run their Shopify pages
[9163.32 --> 9164.16]  yeah okay
[9164.16 --> 9165.22]  so what do I have the login
[9165.22 --> 9166.02]  okay at that point
[9166.02 --> 9166.72]  who owns the shop
[9166.72 --> 9167.40]  do I or do you
[9167.40 --> 9169.20]  am I licensing your brand
[9169.20 --> 9169.96]  now at that point
[9169.96 --> 9170.66]  that's not how that works
[9170.66 --> 9171.76]  there's a few things in here
[9171.76 --> 9172.44]  that I don't think
[9172.44 --> 9173.10]  we're lining up on
[9173.10 --> 9174.50]  one the Shopify page thing
[9174.50 --> 9176.04]  running their Shopify page
[9176.04 --> 9177.50]  oh I know you can have daughter sites
[9177.50 --> 9179.04]  would require a login
[9179.04 --> 9179.44]  yeah
[9179.44 --> 9180.48]  but would not require ownership
[9180.48 --> 9181.08]  of the site
[9181.08 --> 9181.90]  no but it could
[9181.90 --> 9183.54]  but why
[9183.54 --> 9184.42]  it just could
[9184.42 --> 9185.12]  okay
[9185.12 --> 9185.86]  because at that
[9185.86 --> 9186.90]  you don't need that
[9186.90 --> 9187.64]  for customer support
[9187.64 --> 9188.26]  you don't need that
[9188.26 --> 9188.66]  for development
[9188.66 --> 9189.52]  you don't need that
[9189.52 --> 9189.98]  for marketing
[9189.98 --> 9191.22]  I just mean it's complicated
[9191.22 --> 9192.42]  yeah but I think
[9192.42 --> 9193.18]  it's less complicated
[9193.18 --> 9193.74]  than you're
[9193.74 --> 9194.68]  well it can be
[9194.68 --> 9196.68]  yeah so make it less
[9196.68 --> 9198.10]  you don't have to make it
[9198.10 --> 9198.52]  what do you want
[9198.52 --> 9199.40]  what do you want me to do
[9199.40 --> 9200.42]  I think
[9200.42 --> 9201.94]  new product development
[9201.94 --> 9202.68]  would only be for
[9202.68 --> 9204.14]  very very specific creators
[9204.14 --> 9205.80]  and at very very high volume
[9205.80 --> 9206.70]  which is something we're doing
[9206.70 --> 9207.20]  yeah
[9207.20 --> 9210.76]  existing product though
[9210.76 --> 9211.04]  sure
[9211.04 --> 9212.02]  shirt bottles
[9212.02 --> 9213.26]  I think that's a lot easier
[9213.26 --> 9214.18]  than you're letting on
[9214.18 --> 9217.20]  it is
[9217.20 --> 9218.50]  design is almost certainly
[9218.50 --> 9219.42]  going to be done by them
[9219.42 --> 9220.50]  or we could have like
[9220.50 --> 9221.60]  a more premium track
[9221.60 --> 9222.72]  where you work with our designers
[9222.72 --> 9224.92]  it's still more complicated
[9224.92 --> 9225.50]  than that though
[9225.50 --> 9226.26]  because when we print
[9226.26 --> 9226.86]  the design
[9226.86 --> 9227.18]  right
[9227.18 --> 9228.08]  so we get it printed
[9228.08 --> 9228.86]  we have a shirt
[9228.86 --> 9230.10]  now what
[9230.10 --> 9231.04]  are they local
[9231.04 --> 9232.44]  can we show it to them
[9232.44 --> 9233.28]  and make sure that
[9233.28 --> 9233.90]  the colors
[9233.90 --> 9235.02]  meet their needs
[9235.02 --> 9236.10]  is it what they envisioned
[9236.10 --> 9236.88]  when they designed it
[9236.88 --> 9237.44]  on their screen
[9237.44 --> 9238.04]  is their screen
[9238.04 --> 9238.86]  even color accurate
[9238.86 --> 9239.50]  I don't know
[9239.50 --> 9240.72]  just ship it to them
[9240.72 --> 9242.34]  okay
[9242.34 --> 9243.30]  but then now you're
[9243.30 --> 9244.12]  adding extra time
[9244.12 --> 9244.90]  they'll have a hard time
[9244.90 --> 9245.78]  doing anything timely
[9245.78 --> 9246.68]  at that point
[9246.68 --> 9247.80]  because we have to
[9247.80 --> 9248.62]  get their design
[9248.62 --> 9249.92]  get it printed
[9249.92 --> 9251.06]  get it back
[9251.06 --> 9252.12]  ship it to them
[9252.12 --> 9253.26]  get their confirmation
[9253.26 --> 9254.62]  this kind of multi-step process
[9254.62 --> 9255.34]  and you know
[9255.34 --> 9256.44]  I don't think it adds a step
[9256.44 --> 9257.74]  you know from communicating
[9257.74 --> 9258.86]  it shouldn't go printer to us
[9258.86 --> 9259.74]  it should go printer to them
[9259.74 --> 9260.40]  you know from
[9260.40 --> 9261.44]  well it doesn't
[9261.44 --> 9262.42]  because we pick them up locally
[9262.42 --> 9263.28]  we have it printed locally
[9263.28 --> 9264.54]  and you know
[9264.54 --> 9266.06]  from communicating with creators
[9266.06 --> 9268.42]  that they are flaky as f***
[9268.42 --> 9269.34]  they really really
[9269.34 --> 9270.76]  really really love to not answer
[9270.76 --> 9271.60]  they are the worst
[9271.60 --> 9272.64]  yeah they actually are
[9272.64 --> 9273.36]  myself included
[9273.36 --> 9274.04]  and me
[9274.04 --> 9274.58]  yeah
[9274.58 --> 9276.74]  so it's one of those things
[9276.74 --> 9277.18]  where it's like
[9277.18 --> 9278.84]  I know I'm overcomplicating it
[9278.84 --> 9280.22]  but you're oversimplifying it
[9280.22 --> 9280.98]  I think it's probably
[9280.98 --> 9282.44]  true on both sides
[9282.44 --> 9282.86]  yeah
[9282.86 --> 9287.56]  sounds fair
[9287.56 --> 9294.02]  cool
[9294.02 --> 9294.08]  cool
[9294.08 --> 9297.58]  next one
[9297.58 --> 9301.12]  all right
[9301.12 --> 9302.42]  final question here
[9302.42 --> 9303.02]  from Anon
[9303.02 --> 9304.08]  what games
[9304.08 --> 9305.18]  are you guys currently enjoying
[9305.18 --> 9306.32]  toying with Luke
[9306.32 --> 9308.04]  I feel like we've been
[9308.04 --> 9308.80]  getting this question
[9308.80 --> 9309.40]  a lot lately
[9309.40 --> 9310.04]  so my answers
[9310.04 --> 9310.98]  aren't really changing
[9310.98 --> 9311.96]  I also didn't really
[9311.96 --> 9313.10]  play games for the last week
[9313.10 --> 9313.62]  and I'm pretty sure
[9313.62 --> 9314.42]  this question came up
[9314.42 --> 9314.84]  last week
[9314.84 --> 9316.30]  I played some Super Meat Boy
[9316.30 --> 9316.78]  on the plane
[9316.78 --> 9318.02]  it's been a little while
[9318.02 --> 9319.32]  I was A plus on some levels
[9319.32 --> 9320.30]  I played Golf Story
[9320.30 --> 9320.82]  on the plane
[9320.82 --> 9321.26]  nice
[9321.26 --> 9321.78]  yeah
[9321.78 --> 9322.36]  nice
[9322.36 --> 9322.80]  which
[9322.80 --> 9326.54]  I guess to talk about this
[9326.54 --> 9327.20]  Golf Story
[9327.20 --> 9327.80]  one of my favorite
[9327.80 --> 9328.36]  Switch games
[9328.36 --> 9329.14]  that came out
[9329.14 --> 9330.92]  really fantastic game
[9330.92 --> 9331.50]  um
[9331.50 --> 9334.52]  Sports Story
[9334.52 --> 9336.20]  I think was supposed
[9336.20 --> 9337.08]  to be the follow up
[9337.08 --> 9338.32]  Sports Story
[9338.32 --> 9338.88]  how's that going
[9338.88 --> 9340.32]  not well
[9340.32 --> 9341.12]  which is why
[9341.12 --> 9341.66]  I kind of wanted
[9341.66 --> 9342.38]  to mention it
[9342.38 --> 9342.90]  uh
[9342.90 --> 9344.00]  Sidebar Games
[9344.00 --> 9345.36]  uh
[9345.36 --> 9347.04]  was developing it
[9347.04 --> 9347.78]  I think
[9347.78 --> 9348.54]  Sidebar Games
[9348.54 --> 9349.64]  is like a 2-bit studio
[9349.64 --> 9350.94]  um
[9350.94 --> 9353.88]  I
[9353.88 --> 9356.54]  there was a trailer
[9356.54 --> 9357.44]  that went up
[9357.44 --> 9358.02]  on Nintendo's
[9358.02 --> 9358.62]  YouTube channel
[9358.62 --> 9359.70]  for Sports Story
[9359.70 --> 9360.98]  that looked awesome
[9360.98 --> 9361.78]  uh
[9361.78 --> 9362.66]  it looked like gameplay
[9362.66 --> 9363.70]  it looked awesome
[9363.70 --> 9364.88]  um
[9364.88 --> 9367.18]  but it seems like
[9367.18 --> 9368.28]  the project might be dead
[9368.28 --> 9370.14]  which is super
[9370.14 --> 9370.88]  sad
[9370.88 --> 9372.00]  because Golf Story
[9372.00 --> 9373.16]  was actually amazing
[9373.16 --> 9374.82]  and even playing it again
[9374.82 --> 9375.74]  I beat the whole thing
[9375.74 --> 9376.08]  before
[9376.08 --> 9376.94]  there wasn't really
[9376.94 --> 9377.64]  anything else for me
[9377.64 --> 9378.42]  to do on the plane
[9378.42 --> 9379.34]  um
[9379.34 --> 9380.64]  my girlfriend had her
[9380.64 --> 9381.08]  Switch there
[9381.08 --> 9382.36]  I didn't bring mine
[9382.36 --> 9383.38]  she had Golf Story
[9383.38 --> 9383.82]  on it though
[9383.82 --> 9384.24]  so I was like
[9384.24 --> 9384.70]  sweet I'll just
[9384.70 --> 9385.22]  play this again
[9385.22 --> 9386.04]  it was great
[9386.04 --> 9386.98]  I really enjoyed it
[9386.98 --> 9388.08]  and I really hope
[9388.08 --> 9389.52]  that they finish
[9389.52 --> 9390.48]  development on Sports Story
[9390.48 --> 9391.20]  because I would love
[9391.20 --> 9391.66]  to play it
[9391.66 --> 9392.40]  well they haven't
[9392.40 --> 9393.16]  updated Twitter
[9393.16 --> 9394.58]  since December 2021
[9394.58 --> 9395.02]  but
[9395.02 --> 9395.42]  but
[9395.42 --> 9395.78]  but
[9395.78 --> 9396.94]  the time before that
[9396.94 --> 9397.88]  was in June
[9397.88 --> 9398.74]  of 2021
[9398.74 --> 9402.14]  so maybe this is
[9402.14 --> 9403.74]  on brand for them
[9403.74 --> 9404.54]  I don't know
[9404.54 --> 9404.98]  they are
[9404.98 --> 9406.28]  far off their schedule
[9406.28 --> 9407.22]  if I remember correctly
[9407.22 --> 9409.50]  based on like
[9409.50 --> 9410.06]  the video
[9410.06 --> 9410.84]  and stuff
[9410.84 --> 9411.68]  they haven't replied
[9411.68 --> 9412.36]  to anything
[9412.36 --> 9413.26]  since then
[9413.26 --> 9413.66]  yep
[9413.66 --> 9414.78]  it's looking rough
[9414.78 --> 9415.16]  but
[9415.16 --> 9416.64]  if you're out there
[9416.64 --> 9417.70]  there's interest
[9417.70 --> 9419.06]  please
[9419.06 --> 9420.18]  please make game
[9420.18 --> 9421.28]  you will sell
[9421.28 --> 9422.24]  at least one copy
[9422.24 --> 9423.10]  I'll buy it
[9423.10 --> 9425.18]  but yeah
[9425.18 --> 9426.86]  yeah
[9426.86 --> 9429.08]  same answers
[9429.08 --> 9429.56]  as other times
[9429.56 --> 9430.34]  Orna when I'm
[9430.34 --> 9431.34]  walking around
[9431.34 --> 9433.48]  been playing some
[9433.48 --> 9435.98]  little bit of Tarkov
[9435.98 --> 9436.68]  not very much
[9436.68 --> 9437.48]  little bit of
[9437.48 --> 9438.12]  Sniper Elite
[9438.12 --> 9438.84]  not very much
[9438.84 --> 9439.34]  little bit of
[9439.34 --> 9439.72]  Star Citizen
[9439.72 --> 9440.38]  not very much
[9440.38 --> 9440.96]  there you go
[9440.96 --> 9445.12]  I think that's it
[9445.12 --> 9448.02]  I think that's all
[9448.02 --> 9449.64]  thanks for watching
[9449.64 --> 9450.66]  we'll see you again
[9450.66 --> 9451.14]  next week
[9451.14 --> 9452.12]  same bad time
[9452.12 --> 9452.40]  nope
[9452.40 --> 9453.52]  same bad channel
[9453.52 --> 9454.34]  I won't touch that
[9454.34 --> 9454.74]  yep
[9454.74 --> 9455.64]  and
[9455.64 --> 9456.94]  bye

[9479.46 --> 9480.02]  to you today by
[9480.02 --> 9480.56]  Shadow
[9480.56 --> 9481.32]  Keoxia
[9481.32 --> 9481.76]  and
[9481.76 --> 9483.06]  Epidemic Sound
[9483.06 --> 9489.62]  the button wasn't
[9489.62 --> 9490.04]  available
[9490.04 --> 9490.90]  the show is still
[9490.90 --> 9491.26]  going

[9493.70 --> 9493.92]  it
[9493.92 --> 9495.32]  I thought I'm
[9495.32 --> 9495.80]  supposed to wait
[9495.80 --> 9496.40]  a little bit
[9496.40 --> 9497.08]  oh yeah
[9497.08 --> 9497.80]  yeah yeah yeah
