[0.30 → 1.44] There's no lower third.
[2.66 → 3.26] Colton?
[4.16 → 9.40] What is up, ladies and gentlemen, and everything else?
[9.48 → 12.96] We have got a fantastic WEN show lined up for you today.
[13.28 → 14.34] Lots of great topics.
[14.74 → 19.18] The one and only Greg Salazar has done a video on overkill computers.
[19.30 → 21.68] More like overpriced computers.
[21.92 → 22.22] Yeah.
[22.38 → 22.66] Boom.
[22.80 → 23.22] Got them.
[23.36 → 23.50] Yeah.
[23.62 → 24.02] Roasted.
[24.76 → 28.16] In other news, Discord is now on the Xbox.
[28.16 → 31.28] If you're into mild hassles.
[31.68 → 33.50] So that's great.
[33.84 → 34.92] Good for you, Xbox.
[35.24 → 36.32] Welcome to the year.
[36.70 → 39.92] Man, when did we get voice chat on PC?
[40.30 → 40.70] PC?
[41.92 → 42.88] When did vent come?
[42.88 → 44.14] Really a long time ago.
[44.38 → 45.50] Anyway, good for you.
[45.74 → 46.42] What else we got?
[46.58 → 46.72] Yeah.
[47.04 → 48.60] Whale land tickets are live.
[48.78 → 53.96] All the actual whale tickets were gone immediately, but you can still get bring your own computer
[53.96 → 54.36] tickets.
[54.68 → 55.78] So check it out.
[55.98 → 56.40] Buy them.
[56.50 → 56.90] Be there.
[56.90 → 57.58] It's going to be fun.
[57.58 → 58.26] Should be good.
[59.08 → 65.20] And also, people have put firearms on top of robot dogs, and a lot of people are scared.
[66.52 → 67.66] Yeah, we'll talk about it.
[67.66 → 68.90] They could have done it a lot better, to be honest.
[68.96 → 69.82] They did a terrible job.
[70.00 → 70.48] But yeah.
[70.64 → 72.04] You can analyze it later.
[72.12 → 72.84] Analyze it later.
[72.92 → 73.90] For now, we're going to roll that intro.
[73.90 → 92.44] Our regular producer is not here, guys.
[92.90 → 93.62] It's Colt.
[93.84 → 94.52] It's Colt.
[94.52 → 99.44] The show is brought to you by Corsair, Zoho Desk, and PolyArk.
[99.56 → 100.84] Oh, that is the wrong lower third.
[100.98 → 101.34] Yeah.
[102.10 → 103.40] That's actually a problem.
[103.56 → 104.92] This could be a problem.
[106.50 → 106.94] Hey!
[107.94 → 108.26] Yay!
[108.26 → 109.88] I did it.
[109.94 → 111.80] We need our merch messages to work.
[112.02 → 116.78] So recap, for those of you who are new to the show, we do not look at Super Chats or any
[116.78 → 120.04] other kinds of Twitch bits or whatever.
[120.68 → 122.72] You go, you shop on LTTstore.com.
[122.72 → 127.44] And if we're live, you can leave a merch message in the checkout, and it'll either pop up at
[127.44 → 131.76] the bottom, or our producer, who is Colton today, will respond to your message via text,
[131.90 → 133.90] or we will address it on the show.
[134.00 → 135.16] That is the way to send messages.
[135.28 → 139.56] And we're going to jump right into our first topic, which I have not prepped on at all,
[139.62 → 142.12] because let's face it, this is the WAN show.
[142.22 → 143.48] What else were you expecting?
[143.74 → 144.22] Yeah, really.
[144.58 → 151.00] TikToker Circuit boarded makes videos where he rates pre-built, and he created several videos
[151.00 → 155.42] where he called out Overkill Computers for their brutally overpriced systems.
[155.52 → 160.70] Now, there are examples in the doc here, but I would actually rather experience it for
[160.70 → 161.54] myself.
[161.82 → 165.12] So I'm going to head over to OverkillComputers.com.
[166.40 → 166.76] Overkill!
[167.60 → 168.88] Now offering financing.
[169.04 → 170.66] Well, you probably would need to do that.
[170.66 → 171.56] Well, okay.
[171.74 → 174.48] I mean, lots of places have financing.
[174.72 → 179.28] I actually still remember when a friend of mine in high school, Ty, if you're watching,
[179.28 → 181.74] don't get upset about this.
[181.86 → 185.46] A friend of mine in high school financed a computer.
[186.36 → 189.76] Like, remember this dollar a day computers from Dell?
[190.54 → 191.40] No, actually.
[191.68 → 192.14] One dollar.
[192.24 → 193.36] You guys don't remember?
[193.52 → 194.68] You guys don't remember any of that?
[194.92 → 195.82] Maybe it wasn't Dell.
[195.94 → 196.16] Whatever.
[196.30 → 198.86] It was some financing deal where it was like a dollar a day.
[198.90 → 201.06] And he's like, yeah, it's like no money down.
[201.12 → 203.30] I'm like, dude, it's like, it was a lot of money.
[203.36 → 204.44] I forget how much money it was.
[204.44 → 209.48] But to me, a high schooler, it was an unfathomable amount of money to spend on a computer.
[209.58 → 211.62] We're talking like hundreds of actual dollars.
[211.76 → 211.92] Okay.
[212.66 → 216.08] And that's my whole story.
[216.24 → 217.68] Financing computers is stupid.
[218.48 → 224.42] Because by the time he actually paid that piece of shit off, it was like completely worthless.
[224.42 → 231.06] And if he had just saved up and bought what he could afford, then he would have actually ended up ahead of the game.
[231.22 → 232.88] That was my whole thing.
[232.94 → 234.84] Anyway, let's go back to overkillcomputers.com.
[235.32 → 236.56] The Rampage Stealth.
[236.70 → 237.54] Now available.
[237.76 → 239.32] The Project Rampage official.
[239.44 → 240.32] The Orion official.
[240.46 → 241.62] The Frostbite.
[242.36 → 244.72] Well, I think I'm going to check out the Whiteout.
[244.92 → 247.48] This looks like a pretty normal computer, but whiter.
[248.80 → 249.54] Uh, okay.
[249.92 → 250.18] Hello?
[250.78 → 251.18] Learn more.
[251.24 → 251.62] Here we go.
[252.02 → 252.38] Now, okay.
[252.46 → 253.16] More financing.
[253.16 → 254.44] Who do you think you are, Dell?
[254.80 → 256.06] These have cool names.
[256.24 → 257.00] They do have cool names.
[257.24 → 258.86] Wait, what happened to the one I clicked on?
[259.66 → 260.48] Where is it?
[260.96 → 261.78] Blizzard Project.
[262.06 → 263.58] Wait, what is all this stuff?
[264.22 → 264.82] Wait, Frostbite?
[264.92 → 265.30] Is that the one?
[265.74 → 266.56] What did I click on?
[266.74 → 268.54] This is $6,540.
[268.90 → 270.52] Now, hold on just a gosh darn minute here.
[271.54 → 272.06] Frostbite build.
[272.12 → 273.04] What is this?
[273.36 → 273.92] What is...
[273.92 → 275.14] Are these individual...
[275.14 → 276.60] Are these individual systems?
[277.32 → 278.68] Or are these like actual...
[278.68 → 281.46] Actual like series of things.
[281.50 → 282.32] A thing you can buy.
[282.32 → 284.04] When you order this computer...
[284.04 → 285.06] Wait, it has a...
[285.06 → 287.70] Why does it have an 11th gen processor?
[288.62 → 289.78] Hold on a second.
[290.70 → 296.56] This is an 11900K for $6,500.
[297.84 → 300.02] Okay, that is an expensive motherboard.
[300.28 → 302.02] There's only one option for GPU...
[302.02 → 303.26] What even is this?
[304.06 → 305.42] Their configurator...
[305.42 → 305.94] Oh, okay.
[306.64 → 308.04] Some stuff has options.
[308.04 → 308.56] This...
[308.56 → 309.28] NV1.
[309.28 → 310.84] I think you mean NVMe?
[311.80 → 312.44] Kingston...
[312.44 → 314.00] What is a Kingston NV1?
[314.80 → 318.70] Look, to be clear, your PC builder site is better than my PC builder site.
[318.80 → 320.80] Okay, NV1 is apparently an actual thing.
[322.50 → 325.24] Substantial performance upgrade in high capacity.
[326.06 → 326.34] Hmm.
[327.02 → 329.28] Efficient performance for thinner notebooks and systems.
[329.28 → 334.10] That doesn't seem like the default SSD of this particular system.
[334.70 → 337.32] Do you just only have like three SSDs in stock?
[337.42 → 338.46] Is that the problem here?
[338.46 → 339.68] I kind of feel like that's what's going on.
[339.72 → 341.02] Looking through this configurator myself.
[341.26 → 342.80] I don't understand what's happening.
[342.92 → 344.86] We will be filming some of these builds.
[344.98 → 346.20] No, there's only one of these builds.
[346.26 → 347.20] What are you even talking about?
[349.02 → 349.38] Okay.
[349.50 → 351.12] I mean, the video is pretty cool.
[351.24 → 351.78] Is that...
[351.78 → 352.40] Is that the...
[352.40 → 353.96] That doesn't look like that, does it?
[354.82 → 355.72] No, it doesn't.
[355.96 → 356.52] Or does it?
[356.52 → 358.22] I can't tell what I'm looking at.
[358.66 → 360.06] Is this the same computer?
[360.74 → 362.04] I think it might be.
[363.66 → 365.10] I'm actually not sure.
[366.16 → 367.66] The colours keep changing.
[368.52 → 370.04] Okay, maybe there are different ones then.
[371.70 → 372.22] Okay.
[373.62 → 374.14] Okay.
[374.64 → 375.88] Business inquiries?
[376.74 → 377.78] Powered by type form.
[378.14 → 378.98] Work with overkill.
[379.24 → 381.50] If this is for marketing and business requests, okay.
[381.56 → 382.10] They have merch.
[383.88 → 385.02] Ready to game.
[385.70 → 386.32] Shop now.
[387.34 → 387.70] Wait.
[387.80 → 388.44] Oh, okay.
[388.52 → 389.22] We're back on the...
[389.22 → 389.52] Okay.
[390.12 → 391.56] We're back on the computer's page.
[392.22 → 393.58] So, all right.
[393.76 → 397.78] I think we've had a bit of an experience on the overkill.
[397.78 → 398.50] To be fair, and I have...
[398.50 → 399.90] What happened to Project Orion?
[400.02 → 400.64] Where'd it go?
[401.02 → 402.08] It's not even here.
[402.14 → 403.32] What is Project Unknown?
[403.48 → 404.02] $10,000?
[404.78 → 405.90] What does that even mean?
[405.98 → 407.42] This build isn't for the faint of heart.
[407.82 → 410.82] We take your design ideas and create something truly custom.
[411.28 → 412.96] It can be water-cooled or air-cooled.
[413.08 → 413.88] You decide.
[414.04 → 414.36] Wait, what?
[415.36 → 415.76] What?
[415.92 → 418.78] You just give them $10,000, and you hope they give you something good?
[419.20 → 422.02] We will custom badge your PC one out of one.
[423.94 → 424.96] I should just...
[424.96 → 425.74] Oh, man.
[425.84 → 427.80] I'm sorry we've talked about it on WAN Show now.
[428.12 → 429.72] Because I should have just bought one.
[429.82 → 430.42] You should have just bought one.
[430.54 → 430.86] Yeah.
[430.86 → 433.58] That would have been kind of amazing, actually.
[436.14 → 436.52] Huh.
[436.92 → 437.36] Okay.
[437.70 → 437.96] Well.
[438.56 → 439.14] There's a...
[439.14 → 440.82] Did you see the custom request form?
[440.98 → 441.72] I didn't.
[442.06 → 442.72] Want to...
[442.72 → 443.44] Is it on your screen?
[443.46 → 444.28] It's on my screen, yeah.
[444.40 → 444.86] Okay, I'll screen share you.
[445.12 → 446.38] There's a custom request form.
[446.56 → 447.32] Unleash the Beast.
[447.46 → 448.18] Customize yours.
[448.30 → 449.34] Get your gaming PC now.
[449.96 → 452.44] This form is reserved for only the most serious customers.
[452.62 → 454.84] There is a minimum budget of $5,000 for these builds.
[454.84 → 459.08] Due to overwhelming requests, we charge $45 to verify the form submission.
[459.08 → 459.48] What?
[460.40 → 465.84] This is not refundable, but will apply towards your builds if you go forward with one.
[466.66 → 468.52] This is only to hold your place in line.
[468.66 → 472.22] It does not guarantee instant acceptance into the custom build program.
[472.82 → 473.10] Okay.
[473.26 → 477.84] Well, I mean, it's not entirely unreasonable to take a deposit on a bespoke computer.
[477.96 → 478.18] Yeah.
[478.38 → 480.64] But they have no examples of what they're going to build.
[480.90 → 481.90] Like, where's the gallery?
[483.18 → 484.76] Of their, like, previous builds.
[484.86 → 485.06] Yeah.
[485.18 → 486.28] Their previous custom ones.
[486.34 → 487.44] Like, what makes it so custom?
[489.08 → 491.62] I don't know.
[492.44 → 497.16] Yeah, because, like, how much would creating, like, a custom hardline water cooling system cost?
[497.54 → 501.16] I mean, we could price these out at other places that do them.
[501.22 → 502.08] I mean, Main Gear does.
[502.38 → 502.68] Sure.
[502.86 → 503.32] Yeah, let's do that.
[503.32 → 504.58] So here, I'm going to head over to Main Gear.
[504.58 → 514.30] Because, like, looking at the site, this doesn't look like they're trying to position themselves as, like, a price competitor for parts.
[514.80 → 524.60] It looks like, like, with the names of things and the photos that they're choosing and whatnot, it sounds like they're trying to be, like, the we are a fancy builder.
[524.94 → 525.16] You know?
[525.28 → 526.58] Yeah, which is fair enough.
[526.58 → 527.58] There's...
[527.58 → 527.92] There's...
[527.92 → 533.14] I do also like that their links at the bottom goes the team, financing, and then gaming PCs.
[533.48 → 533.76] Okay.
[533.86 → 538.02] Just like how when you first land on their website, the first thing you see is financing, not anything to do with computers.
[538.26 → 540.62] Main Gear is not looking too great here either.
[541.20 → 541.98] That's what I'm talking about.
[542.02 → 543.72] Like, if you're going to put the time into...
[543.72 → 544.36] How am I supposed to customize this?
[544.60 → 545.58] If you're...
[545.58 → 547.30] I don't know about that part.
[547.36 → 548.06] What just happened?
[548.60 → 550.58] No, that's not what I...
[550.58 → 551.20] But, like...
[551.20 → 552.40] This is not a quick ship.
[552.46 → 553.68] I wanted to customize it.
[553.98 → 557.76] If you want your computer built in North America...
[557.76 → 558.32] Sure.
[558.52 → 565.28] And you want it built with, like, custom hardline water cooling and all this other kind of stuff, like, costs are going to ramp up really quick.
[565.36 → 565.56] Okay.
[565.60 → 565.82] Well, here.
[565.88 → 566.50] Let's select...
[566.50 → 567.92] We'll go for the rush, right?
[567.98 → 569.86] That looks pretty, like, you know, whatever.
[570.86 → 571.18] Okay.
[571.42 → 572.52] So, here.
[572.62 → 572.82] Okay.
[572.94 → 573.60] Apex Custom.
[573.66 → 574.74] How much was the one we just looked at?
[574.78 → 575.66] Like, $5,500?
[576.46 → 578.04] The Frost one or whatever?
[578.18 → 578.38] Yeah.
[578.48 → 578.78] That one?
[578.84 → 579.02] Yeah.
[579.30 → 580.52] Let me verify.
[580.52 → 581.40] Frostbite Official.
[581.88 → 582.08] Okay.
[582.12 → 582.36] So, here.
[582.44 → 584.04] Let's put some Hell cat Red up in here.
[584.04 → 585.42] You click on it, and it doesn't...
[585.42 → 586.06] Where did it go?
[586.48 → 586.74] Okay.
[587.22 → 588.50] Integrated with soft tubing.
[588.72 → 588.84] Okay.
[589.16 → 595.46] Hardline tubing from Main Gear apparently will run you $1,500 on your bill.
[595.56 → 596.22] That's what I'm saying.
[596.68 → 599.58] So, like, the notes in the doc are like, oh, so the bill fee is like $1,000.
[599.94 → 602.40] And it's like, okay, they have a bunch of different computers on here.
[602.48 → 607.16] But if you're getting builds that have hardline water cooling and all this other kind of stuff, like, this is major.
[607.26 → 607.96] It's going to cost a lot.
[608.38 → 610.42] Project Frostbite is $6,540.
[611.50 → 612.60] $6,540.
[613.08 → 613.22] Yeah.
[613.30 → 613.64] Okay.
[613.72 → 617.72] Well, let's see what kind of spec I can get for that kind of budget.
[618.24 → 622.34] Does Project Frostbite have a custom, like, automotive finish or whatever?
[623.62 → 627.94] Wait, do I have to select a fancy paint job or can I just not?
[628.36 → 630.14] I mean, if you're spending that much, like...
[630.14 → 633.22] Chameleon Pearl multiple colours.
[633.36 → 634.16] Now, hold on a second.
[634.34 → 635.12] I mean, that sounds amazing.
[635.12 → 636.90] What if I don't want that?
[636.98 → 637.38] What if I...
[637.38 → 637.88] Wait, hold on.
[637.94 → 639.68] Can I not unselect the paint job?
[639.84 → 641.30] Not to toot main gear either.
[641.42 → 641.90] Gosh darn it.
[641.90 → 649.88] But, like, if I was spending that type of cash, I would want to go with a company that I knew had a good pedigree and reputation.
[650.26 → 651.50] And main gear, like, does.
[651.50 → 652.80] Yeah, I don't know.
[652.88 → 656.28] Right now, their site is kind of a burr under my saddle.
[656.40 → 657.10] Oh, clear selection.
[657.22 → 657.68] There it is.
[658.12 → 658.30] Okay.
[658.38 → 662.40] So, I don't need the automotive paint, but I am going to go with the hard line cooling.
[663.10 → 667.08] We also have the ability to add custom paint jobs with graphics and custom themes.
[667.28 → 668.30] This will add cost.
[668.36 → 668.60] Okay.
[668.60 → 669.64] So, it's not included.
[669.90 → 670.02] Yeah.
[670.62 → 670.96] Okay.
[671.12 → 671.48] Processor.
[671.64 → 672.08] Okay.
[672.68 → 683.16] Main gear's got a bit of a problem here, too, because this was also a system that started at, like, many thousands of dollars and out of the box had a 5600X as the CPU.
[683.88 → 685.52] That is what we call in the business...
[685.52 → 687.20] Should we spec equalize?
[687.92 → 688.32] Suboptimal.
[689.18 → 693.92] Well, no, we can't, because for whatever reason, Overkill has an 11th gen.
[694.34 → 694.50] Yeah.
[694.66 → 696.16] So, I don't know what's up with...
[696.16 → 697.36] Yeah, this has 16 gigs of...
[697.36 → 700.08] Now, hold just a gosh darn minute here, Main Gear.
[700.90 → 703.68] What is the default configuration?
[704.22 → 706.30] $4,400 for the Apex Rush.
[706.40 → 708.08] That does not have fancy paint.
[708.48 → 710.70] Apparently, Overkill doesn't have a warranty.
[711.42 → 712.16] Oh, really?
[713.16 → 715.14] That's also suboptimal.
[715.14 → 716.26] So, hold on a second.
[716.36 → 719.76] It does come with water cooling, but it's soft tubing.
[720.62 → 721.10] Okay.
[721.68 → 722.76] Includes RGB fans.
[722.90 → 725.02] Cools both CPU and GPU.
[725.02 → 728.04] Comes with a 3080.
[729.06 → 729.46] Okay.
[730.74 → 735.64] If I put a decent CPU in here, something comparable, let's put a 5900X.
[735.70 → 740.34] To be clear, I'm not, like, trashing on people who have a CPU that isn't a 5900X.
[740.74 → 740.92] Okay.
[741.48 → 746.06] I'm just saying, at this price tier, you should have a 5900X.
[746.08 → 746.80] That's all I'm saying.
[747.26 → 752.04] I'm going to put 64 gigs of Fury Renegade RGB memory in here.
[752.24 → 753.12] We'll throw a...
[753.12 → 754.78] I mean, you need a 1200W power supply.
[754.86 → 756.18] You're going to spend this kind of money, right?
[756.38 → 756.96] Like, come on.
[758.32 → 759.16] NVMe SSD.
[759.96 → 760.24] Wow.
[760.30 → 763.42] It comes with a 512GB SSD by default.
[764.18 → 766.74] I'm going to go 2TB, 670, actually.
[767.20 → 769.20] So, you want their default to be cranked up more.
[769.20 → 771.22] Now, just a gosh darn minute.
[771.34 → 775.52] Are they charging $550 for a Samsung 980 Pro?
[776.04 → 777.22] Does that seem right?
[779.28 → 780.44] Does that seem right?
[780.54 → 783.90] I mean, you know, I don't shop for SSDs often.
[784.64 → 785.90] But does that seem right?
[786.74 → 788.14] That doesn't seem right.
[788.34 → 788.64] You know?
[788.84 → 790.00] You know what I'm saying, Luke?
[790.54 → 791.70] Does it seem right?
[791.70 → 792.00] No.
[793.42 → 800.28] $249.99 is what that 2TB 980 Pro is going to cost you.
[800.92 → 806.78] And Main Gear wants more than that to upgrade to...
[806.78 → 807.24] Wait, no.
[807.36 → 807.68] Hold on.
[807.74 → 807.96] What?
[808.56 → 810.12] Now I'm really confused.
[810.86 → 811.88] What happened here?
[812.36 → 812.68] No.
[812.94 → 813.76] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[813.82 → 817.68] That is over the default one here, right?
[817.92 → 818.34] Yes.
[818.44 → 821.38] I think Overkill Computers does have a warranty, by the way.
[821.38 → 826.48] Because if I select this one here, this shouldn't say plus 297, right?
[827.80 → 831.70] That's over top of this one, if you look at how the number is changing.
[832.26 → 840.46] Either way, either way, $297 as an up charge over a 512 gig 670p.
[841.22 → 842.96] Hold on just a gosh darn minute.
[844.14 → 846.14] 670p, 512.
[847.02 → 848.56] How much is one of those going to run you?
[848.60 → 849.20] 50 bucks.
[849.20 → 853.62] So that's a solid $100 of margin for upgrading your SSD.
[853.88 → 854.08] Man.
[855.42 → 855.76] Colton?
[856.80 → 857.90] Is it finally happening?
[858.00 → 858.92] Are we going to start an SI?
[861.10 → 861.78] We could.
[861.96 → 862.96] I had some ideas.
[863.62 → 864.88] I sent them to Linus.
[865.24 → 868.84] But I think there's some actually pretty cool things we could do.
[869.38 → 870.24] We're not doing it.
[870.54 → 871.02] Not now.
[871.18 → 871.34] No.
[871.34 → 873.00] No, we're not doing it.
[873.00 → 873.50] It's a cool idea.
[873.58 → 875.40] I don't know if it makes actual sense.
[875.50 → 875.90] It doesn't right now.
[875.90 → 876.60] It doesn't make this sense.
[876.60 → 876.80] Yeah.
[877.04 → 877.34] Luke.
[877.86 → 878.18] Unfortunately.
[878.70 → 878.94] Luke.
[879.18 → 879.26] Luke.
[879.26 → 879.92] We'll see, dude.
[880.08 → 880.40] Luke.
[880.62 → 882.12] What are you going to do in 10 years, huh?
[882.44 → 883.34] What am I going to do in 10 years?
[883.34 → 884.92] Not build computers all day.
[884.96 → 885.60] Well, it's been...
[885.60 → 886.22] Well, not you.
[886.42 → 886.94] Well...
[886.94 → 887.84] The company.
[889.94 → 891.26] It's been 10 years so far.
[891.60 → 892.66] If it...
[892.66 → 895.02] Do you think 10 years ago you would have said we'd have a lab?
[895.26 → 895.60] No.
[895.80 → 896.04] Yeah.
[896.94 → 898.34] So never say never.
[900.10 → 900.46] Dash.
[900.68 → 901.16] Justin Bieber.
[903.38 → 903.74] Okay.
[904.74 → 906.48] So what are your specs?
[906.58 → 908.66] Do you have 64 gigs or 32 gigs of RAM?
[908.72 → 909.04] Okay.
[909.06 → 909.74] Let me jump back to it.
[909.86 → 910.96] I was looking through the warranty.
[910.96 → 913.14] I think some people are...
[913.14 → 916.86] It's written oddly, but I think they have a parts and labour warranty for one year.
[917.28 → 921.94] There's some weird stuff where you have to cover half the shipping cost and some other things and stuff.
[922.04 → 924.82] And if you live outside the US, you don't have a warranty and blah, blah, blah.
[925.12 → 925.38] Okay.
[925.38 → 926.32] But I think there's stuff.
[926.58 → 926.84] But okay.
[926.96 → 927.76] Jumping back to the computer.
[927.86 → 928.04] Yeah.
[929.70 → 930.02] RAM.
[930.72 → 931.32] 32 gigs.
[931.68 → 932.20] 32 gigs.
[932.40 → 932.50] All right.
[932.52 → 933.72] Four 8 gig dims.
[934.54 → 934.86] Okay.
[934.94 → 937.88] I've got 2 by 16 because I'm not an idiot.
[938.02 → 938.28] Yeah.
[938.48 → 939.24] Because I'm main gear.
[939.92 → 940.72] So that's cool.
[941.12 → 941.38] All right.
[941.46 → 942.96] I'm at 4869.
[943.60 → 945.18] I have a 5900X.
[945.32 → 945.46] Here.
[945.50 → 946.70] I'm just going to come back to the screen here.
[946.94 → 948.30] I have a 5900X.
[948.66 → 950.92] I have 32 gigs RAM.
[951.00 → 953.74] I have a 3080, which I believe is the same.
[953.82 → 954.80] We both have 3080s.
[954.80 → 956.40] But what I don't have.
[956.52 → 956.80] Wait.
[956.88 → 957.02] Sorry.
[957.08 → 958.18] You have a 5900X?
[958.28 → 958.42] Yeah.
[959.24 → 959.52] Okay.
[959.58 → 960.80] I also have a 5900X.
[960.92 → 961.12] Okay.
[961.26 → 963.66] What I don't have is hardline cooling.
[963.88 → 967.14] As soon as I select hardline cooling, I'm at 6369.
[967.32 → 967.50] Yeah.
[967.50 → 969.02] So they're extremely similarly priced.
[969.34 → 969.72] Okay.
[970.18 → 970.60] Yeah.
[970.60 → 974.72] So this is a 5900X with an DOG X570.
[975.02 → 976.00] I'm coming over to your screen.
[976.16 → 976.28] Yep.
[976.68 → 976.88] Yeah.
[976.88 → 976.94] Yeah.
[977.10 → 984.44] 5900X, DOG X570, 3080, 1 terabyte, and V1.
[984.44 → 989.44] The really stupid choice of four separate sticks of 8 gig dims.
[990.62 → 991.76] And it's 6500.
[994.64 → 995.08] Okay.
[995.88 → 996.94] What case is yours in?
[997.00 → 998.28] Is it in like a main gear custom?
[999.08 → 1000.46] I don't know what it's in.
[1000.54 → 1001.30] Some case.
[1001.42 → 1002.72] Li and Leo 11 Dynamic XL.
[1002.72 → 1007.38] This is the only 11 Dynamic, not XL.
[1007.48 → 1008.82] Well, mine is XL.
[1009.22 → 1009.54] Wow.
[1009.70 → 1010.00] Yeah.
[1010.30 → 1010.92] That's a win.
[1011.12 → 1013.08] I bet you feel inadequate.
[1014.00 → 1014.24] Yeah.
[1014.80 → 1015.24] Yeah.
[1015.24 → 1015.36] Yeah.
[1015.36 → 1015.56] Yeah.
[1015.56 → 1015.68] Yeah.
[1015.68 → 1016.68] So I don't know.
[1016.82 → 1018.12] Hardline water cooling is super expensive.
[1018.46 → 1019.60] That's my main takeaway.
[1021.48 → 1026.30] And I can actually give you guys some background for why that would be.
[1026.60 → 1032.34] I think that a lot of you are probably looking at this going, man, Linus, you should
[1032.34 → 1038.44] get into the system integrator business because you could bring hardline water cooling to the
[1038.44 → 1039.82] people at an affordable.
[1039.96 → 1041.80] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1041.80 → 1043.16] It's not an affordable thing to do.
[1043.16 → 1048.44] There is so much hassle involved in water cooling computers for customers.
[1048.82 → 1054.32] And I can tell you that anyone who's been doing it as long as main gear has learned a
[1054.32 → 1059.62] lesson from some time that they tried to get all price competitive about hardline water
[1059.62 → 1067.22] cooling and then realized that the cost of it is not just the cost of the parts and the labour.
[1067.44 → 1073.08] The cost of it is the cost of the parts and the labour and supporting the bloody thing when
[1073.08 → 1079.56] some butthead who can't build their own hardline water cooling system wants to perform maintenance on a
[1079.56 → 1083.36] hardline water cooling system and expects you to sit on the phone with them for four
[1083.36 → 1084.40] hours and walk you through it.
[1084.40 → 1085.40] That's the problem.
[1086.26 → 1089.72] Supporting water cooled systems is horrible.
[1091.72 → 1095.28] Joffre says, how is paying $1,500 for hardline justified?
[1095.66 → 1098.50] That could pay for 40 hours of some random to do it.
[1098.68 → 1102.36] If I can interject here, Cave Johnson on float plane.
[1102.42 → 1102.58] Yeah.
[1102.78 → 1105.72] What you're referring to as Linux is actually...
[1106.22 → 1106.78] Sorry, go ahead.
[1107.18 → 1108.54] Cave Johnson on float plane.
[1109.04 → 1113.62] It says, specking out the water cooling parts from EK's configurator brings the cost of just the
[1113.62 → 1115.70] hardline cooling without assembly to $1,200.
[1116.80 → 1117.16] Yeah.
[1117.30 → 1120.82] So hardline components are super expensive.
[1121.04 → 1125.82] So if you want to know who's actually making the margin in water cooling, that would be the
[1125.82 → 1126.96] EK's of the world.
[1127.34 → 1128.78] When you're spending...
[1128.78 → 1132.84] I remember back when fancy fittings first started to really take off.
[1132.84 → 1140.74] I was the product manager for Bits Power, who was really the OG fancy special, all different
[1140.74 → 1141.16] finishes.
[1141.40 → 1142.88] I looked at their product catalogue.
[1142.98 → 1146.34] I'm like, who needs this many different colours of fitting?
[1146.92 → 1150.44] Why do we need a shiny black and a matte black and a diamond black?
[1150.78 → 1152.08] They're black, right?
[1153.04 → 1153.58] Nope.
[1153.58 → 1157.88] So we carried only a small subset of what they had because it just wasn't scalable.
[1158.06 → 1158.68] It wasn't feasible.
[1159.44 → 1167.40] But man, when you're making like $8 a fitting or charging like $8 a fitting, it adds up real,
[1167.52 → 1168.16] real fast.
[1168.18 → 1169.52] They're more expensive than that now.
[1169.52 → 1177.82] So let's go back with that in mind, with that overkill computers, aside from being clearly
[1177.82 → 1184.36] a much smaller outfit, with it in mind that overkill computers is actually not that far
[1184.36 → 1187.32] off what someone like a main gear is charging for a system like that.
[1187.38 → 1188.56] Let's go back to our notes here.
[1188.62 → 1189.66] This was prepared by Alex.
[1190.28 → 1196.32] So TikToker Circuit Board, um, Raids pre-built and made several videos calling out overkill computers
[1196.32 → 1198.02] for their brutally overpriced systems.
[1198.02 → 1202.96] For instance, they are selling a system for $2724, $2,724.
[1203.32 → 1204.26] Let me try to find this system.
[1204.26 → 1209.60] With an R7 5800X, RTX 3070, and an AS Rock B550 motherboard.
[1209.86 → 1215.16] So Greg Salazar went through PC Part Picker for the same parts and got a price of a whopping
[1215.16 → 1217.56] $1,000 less.
[1217.74 → 1221.40] So that's $1,000 of build fee.
[1221.92 → 1227.24] Now it could just be that Luke and I happened to find the one system that was competitively
[1227.24 → 1227.46] priced.
[1227.46 → 1228.16] Definitely possible.
[1228.40 → 1234.66] And happened to compare it to one of, if not the most expensive boutique builders.
[1234.98 → 1235.92] Also a thing that happened.
[1236.10 → 1237.96] But I mean, it was a hardline system.
[1238.16 → 1242.14] There isn't a, uh, at least the last time I checked, there wasn't a ton of them that
[1242.14 → 1242.70] did hardline.
[1242.72 → 1244.70] No, there's not a ton because it's a nightmare.
[1244.82 → 1250.54] Whereas if we're just looking at a system that is not hardline water cooled, that's a
[1250.54 → 1250.84] problem.
[1250.92 → 1251.88] Do you want to try and find that?
[1252.00 → 1252.56] $2724?
[1252.56 → 1253.70] You found it.
[1253.76 → 1253.92] All right.
[1253.92 → 1254.62] Let's have a look.
[1254.92 → 1256.34] Is it as bad as we think?
[1256.46 → 1256.90] Oh boy.
[1256.98 → 1257.84] That's an AIO.
[1258.02 → 1258.96] That is an AIO.
[1259.02 → 1261.64] Everything here is, is kind of a pre-pack.
[1261.76 → 1266.18] I don't know if that, uh, power supply has some extensions on it to get those white cables
[1266.18 → 1266.78] with combs.
[1267.30 → 1269.78] Um, but that's not like, those are not that expensive.
[1269.78 → 1270.18] No.
[1270.24 → 1274.10] And the case is handling your, your cable management, which is what actually looks perfect.
[1274.22 → 1275.62] This is not a.
[1276.88 → 1277.24] Primo.
[1277.60 → 1279.36] If, if I'm assuming.
[1280.14 → 1281.60] Greg Salazar is a fantastic dude.
[1281.62 → 1282.80] I'm assuming what he did is accurate.
[1282.80 → 1287.20] So if this is a thousand bucks over, which like, it looks like it would be, um, because
[1287.20 → 1288.82] holy crap, this should not be $2,700.
[1289.34 → 1291.18] Then yeah, it's way massively overpriced.
[1291.30 → 1297.88] I'm wondering if this has not reflected any price changes from when prices were all cranked
[1297.88 → 1298.02] up.
[1298.08 → 1298.18] Yeah.
[1298.18 → 1303.58] Cause it seems like rather than these systems being series of systems that they build,
[1303.72 → 1308.88] it seems like this is just the system that Buddy made.
[1308.88 → 1314.40] And if you want him to recreate that exact system, then he'll build it for you, which
[1314.40 → 1320.24] is like, um, not that clever of a business strategy.
[1320.74 → 1323.44] But I'm also kind of assuming this isn't their bread and butter.
[1324.22 → 1326.64] Well, I have no idea what their bread and butter would even mean.
[1326.64 → 1328.16] I think their bread and butter is financing.
[1330.20 → 1332.96] Um, but yeah, I, I don't know.
[1333.04 → 1335.20] This is, this is pretty brutally priced 100%.
[1335.20 → 1341.14] And I, and I'm rather certain we could shop around and find way better offers.
[1341.32 → 1347.42] Now overpriced compute, excuse me, overkill computers charging a lot for their computers
[1347.42 → 1349.48] is not really the topic today.
[1350.24 → 1357.84] What happened was overkill computers responded to circuit boards, correct reporting on the
[1357.84 → 1362.80] pricing and said, this was overkill's creative director over on Instagram.
[1362.80 → 1366.82] Have fun with your 20,000 view videos from now on brother.
[1367.08 → 1370.68] I wish you all well, and I'm not threatening you in the slightest.
[1371.00 → 1373.04] I feel bad for your situation.
[1373.58 → 1376.92] Let me know if I can do anything to help you out.
[1377.12 → 1378.10] Heart emoji.
[1378.54 → 1379.66] Holy crap.
[1379.74 → 1380.46] That's cringe.
[1383.22 → 1386.68] I hadn't actually, I hadn't read or heard that yet.
[1387.30 → 1388.48] Brother in Christ.
[1388.48 → 1391.34] Hell yeah, brother.
[1391.78 → 1392.88] I, I had not.
[1393.66 → 1394.06] Wow.
[1399.06 → 1399.54] All right.
[1399.62 → 1402.64] This is part of the like, we don't really read the topics too much for the show starts.
[1402.74 → 1404.42] I had not heard that.
[1404.70 → 1405.78] That's crazy.
[1407.86 → 1410.72] Chat was like, this topic's kind of boring.
[1410.86 → 1411.90] We should move on.
[1411.90 → 1412.22] Yeah.
[1412.30 → 1413.10] We get the quote.
[1413.10 → 1418.88] Throwing in, I'm not threatening you and ending it with a heart.
[1419.00 → 1421.58] I feel bad for your situation.
[1422.00 → 1422.56] Wow.
[1422.56 → 1424.56] What are you even talking about?
[1425.44 → 1426.30] Oh my goodness.
[1426.46 → 1426.76] Wow.
[1426.76 → 1432.78] So then, ex-employees and customers of Overkill then began reaching out to add a bit of spice
[1432.78 → 1433.56] to the story.
[1433.82 → 1436.42] We got to sprinkle this with some allegedly's here.
[1436.56 → 1436.70] Okay.
[1436.82 → 1438.84] So here's a here's a major alleged.
[1439.14 → 1439.64] Ample helping.
[1439.64 → 1445.78] Let me just take a swig of allegedly from this patriotic red and white Canada water bottle.
[1445.88 → 1448.44] LTT store.com available in two different sizes.
[1448.74 → 1449.72] Oh my goodness.
[1449.80 → 1455.14] Customers that purchased computers sometimes allegedly had to wait over six months to get
[1455.14 → 1455.72] their system.
[1455.90 → 1459.94] Also, some customers that had already waited months apparently received emails saying that
[1459.94 → 1463.52] the GPU they'd ordered was no longer available, and would have to pay an additional $400
[1463.52 → 1464.98] to put a GPU in their system.
[1464.98 → 1472.42] So this might be just because Overkill is an tiny outfit that simply has absolutely
[1472.42 → 1476.14] no actual stock, no relationships with vendors.
[1476.48 → 1483.56] The customer also had to sign a confidentiality agreement, allegedly, which is, yeah, the face
[1483.56 → 1484.06] he's making.
[1484.16 → 1485.20] That's how I feel about it.
[1485.20 → 1491.46] If I ever have to sign a confidentiality agreement to buy a computer, it better be.
[1492.22 → 1493.42] Like from NASA.
[1493.74 → 1494.06] Yeah.
[1494.24 → 1494.44] Yeah.
[1494.56 → 1494.88] NASA computer.
[1494.88 → 1499.68] Or like Intel and every part or at least some part in it is like never released or something.
[1499.84 → 1499.94] Yeah.
[1499.98 → 1502.00] And then I will enthusiastically sign that.
[1502.14 → 1507.02] If I'm just buying it from a random store, and they're like, here, sign an NDA, I'm just
[1507.02 → 1508.42] not going to do business there.
[1508.52 → 1512.66] Overkill also allegedly requires employees to sign NDAs, even though they're an SI and I doubt
[1512.66 → 1514.10] they have many proprietary things on the go.
[1514.10 → 1515.42] I actually disagree with that.
[1515.68 → 1515.74] No.
[1515.90 → 1516.10] Yeah.
[1516.22 → 1521.38] Any company, you're going to have an NDA for your employees, even if it's as simple as
[1521.38 → 1521.86] like, okay.
[1522.10 → 1523.20] What if you're dealing with customer data?
[1523.38 → 1528.32] In our NDA, we have a non-disclosure clause in our employee agreement that says you can't
[1528.32 → 1530.38] disclose personal information about your colleagues.
[1530.74 → 1530.94] Yeah.
[1531.08 → 1533.40] That's just basic.
[1533.64 → 1534.34] It's common decency.
[1534.34 → 1538.62] If you're one of the computer builders, your ticket will probably come in with the customer's
[1538.62 → 1539.20] name on it.
[1539.72 → 1540.50] Like, yeah, I don't know.
[1540.66 → 1540.82] That's.
[1540.96 → 1541.16] Yeah.
[1541.26 → 1543.34] No, that makes perfect sense to me.
[1543.34 → 1547.36] Apparently, though, there are some content creators that are going to court with Overkill
[1547.36 → 1549.52] regarding a sponsorship contract.
[1549.66 → 1551.26] We have very few details about that.
[1551.48 → 1552.98] Although they do have a Patreon.
[1553.22 → 1553.26] Allegedly.
[1553.82 → 1553.84] Allegedly.
[1553.84 → 1553.94] Allegedly.
[1553.94 → 1560.46] Where they have members-only PC giveaways, allegedly, which at least according to Canadian
[1560.46 → 1566.54] laws, I have no idea how this works in America, according to Canadian laws is illegal.
[1566.68 → 1568.30] That constitutes a lottery.
[1568.30 → 1570.66] And yeah, so these are.
[1570.76 → 1571.12] Oh, OK.
[1571.22 → 1572.28] Yeah, here it is.
[1572.54 → 1574.14] Entries to members-only computer giveaways.
[1574.22 → 1576.22] We will be giving away one per month.
[1576.32 → 1577.26] They are an American company.
[1577.32 → 1579.64] I don't know what the rules are for that.
[1579.70 → 1581.28] I have no idea what their lottery laws are.
[1581.40 → 1587.58] But up here, in order to run a giveaway and have it not be a lottery, which would mean
[1587.58 → 1592.68] that you're under a completely different set of much, much more stringent laws, there has
[1592.68 → 1595.34] to be a no-purchase-necessary way to enter.
[1597.26 → 1602.74] So, yeah, I have a hard time imagining why you'd have a Patreon for a system integrator.
[1603.24 → 1606.60] Some people in full-plane chat are saying that that's how it works in most states.
[1606.60 → 1615.86] So, Overkill then sent Circuit BARDA a cease and desist, alleging that he was defamatory
[1615.86 → 1621.54] toward the company, requesting all videos about them to be deleted and all comments about
[1621.54 → 1622.22] them removed.
[1622.86 → 1630.04] Well, gee, I can tell you how I feel about threatening members of the media, who is basically anyone
[1630.04 → 1632.28] with a phone and a TikTok account at this point, I suppose.
[1632.28 → 1632.82] Yep, yep.
[1633.06 → 1633.86] It ain't cool.
[1633.86 → 1634.18] Cool.
[1634.26 → 1639.12] Tell you what, Overkill, I think your pricing sucks on that system, too.
[1639.28 → 1639.50] Yeah.
[1640.20 → 1640.60] Buddy?
[1640.94 → 1641.74] Or brother?
[1642.28 → 1643.32] You want my address?
[1643.64 → 1645.82] You want to know where to address the cease and desist?
[1645.94 → 1646.88] You can find it on Google.
[1647.04 → 1648.78] Because I could use some free toilet paper.
[1651.26 → 1655.14] I would actually much rather not wipe my butt with, like...
[1655.14 → 1656.02] It'd be uncomfortable.
[1656.46 → 1659.28] Yeah, you could get a paper cut in a really awful place.
[1659.28 → 1664.06] It's like, I'd imagine it would have a horrible time healing with all the bacteria and everything.
[1664.26 → 1666.50] Like, it just seems like a pretty bad time.
[1666.80 → 1667.40] Yeah, not good.
[1667.74 → 1671.06] Anyway, this quote is a little long, but worth it.
[1671.56 → 1676.70] Overkill's CEO, trying to do his best to turn a molehill into artesian builds, then went
[1676.70 → 1682.94] on TikTok, to say things like, we get a lot of views and therefore have some haters.
[1683.40 → 1687.48] We also have some past employees with opinions on what we do, and unfortunately, we have one
[1687.48 → 1690.72] employee who has made it his mission to defame Overkill computers.
[1691.16 → 1695.94] And to those people, I say, what you're doing in darkness will soon come to light.
[1696.94 → 1701.30] And as a marine vet, I have a lot more respect for people who aren't cowards.
[1701.62 → 1702.14] Okay.
[1702.90 → 1703.16] What?
[1704.92 → 1705.70] Uh, okay.
[1705.86 → 1706.46] He's a sniper.
[1707.74 → 1709.10] Over 900 confirmed kills.
[1710.20 → 1710.68] Uh...
[1710.68 → 1712.52] Speed and accuracy that has never been seen before.
[1713.68 → 1714.08] Okay.
[1714.94 → 1719.52] On the topic of prices, Overkill's CEO said, we don't and will not ever place ourselves at
[1719.52 → 1720.48] the lowest profit margin.
[1720.56 → 1724.24] As a matter of fact, we sometimes raise our prices to slow the number of orders coming through.
[1724.72 → 1725.80] I've never heard of these guys.
[1725.84 → 1729.40] How are there so many system integrators that I have never even heard of?
[1729.48 → 1729.78] I don't know.
[1729.82 → 1730.42] I haven't heard of them either.
[1730.42 → 1732.96] That is a fairly standard tactic, though.
[1733.10 → 1734.62] Like, if you are...
[1734.62 → 1741.14] I don't think it means adding $1,000 onto a like, not very fantastic system.
[1741.28 → 1745.32] But, like, if you have too many orders coming in, it is fairly standard practice for businesses
[1745.32 → 1746.12] to raise your prices.
[1746.18 → 1747.22] I just mean, I doubt that.
[1747.34 → 1747.58] Yeah.
[1747.58 → 1750.42] Um, it is a simple case of supply and demand.
[1750.50 → 1754.50] The people that keep saying we need to do PC builds for $300 profit, they can get a computer
[1754.50 → 1756.62] somewhere else or maybe learn how to build their own gaming PC.
[1756.70 → 1757.86] They can do that, by the way.
[1758.14 → 1758.18] Yeah.
[1758.18 → 1758.92] It's a great channel.
[1759.12 → 1762.08] Um, gamers tech tips or...
[1762.08 → 1762.60] Gamers Nexus?
[1763.02 → 1763.94] Bit tips or...
[1763.94 → 1764.50] Jays Two Cents?
[1764.62 → 1765.14] Jays Two...
[1765.14 → 1765.78] Greg Salazar?
[1766.14 → 1766.80] Well, whatever.
[1766.88 → 1767.74] There are lots of options.
[1767.84 → 1768.34] That's the point.
[1768.44 → 1768.74] Nitwit?
[1768.74 → 1773.98] And for a time, I may move in silence and put chess pieces in place.
[1774.20 → 1774.48] Wow.
[1774.60 → 1776.14] But you can rest assured...
[1776.14 → 1776.76] That sounds sick.
[1776.78 → 1782.80] If you threaten my business, my family, and my livelihood, I will utilize every resource
[1782.80 → 1787.60] at my disposal to arrange a coordinated and effective response.
[1787.90 → 1789.26] That wraps it up.
[1789.52 → 1790.46] Let's go.
[1792.94 → 1794.14] I'd watch this movie, dude.
[1794.44 → 1795.66] This is the movie Taken.
[1795.80 → 1796.56] I'd watch this movie.
[1797.28 → 1797.92] I'm in.
[1798.74 → 1803.76] Oh, the sheer volume of cringe is just overwhelming.
[1806.28 → 1806.72] Oh.
[1807.36 → 1808.50] This is great.
[1808.62 → 1809.30] This is great.
[1809.36 → 1810.04] Look at this.
[1810.42 → 1811.46] This is terrific.
[1811.78 → 1813.46] There's a Doggett, Doggett Err quote.
[1813.82 → 1815.86] What grand and intoxicating innocence.
[1816.12 → 1816.82] Look at this.
[1816.94 → 1817.72] I love it.
[1818.02 → 1819.40] Can you just stop?
[1819.64 → 1820.42] Why you have to...
[1820.42 → 1821.48] Like, why you have to...
[1821.48 → 1823.38] Why you have to be like that, you know?
[1823.86 → 1824.70] So, anyway.
[1824.70 → 1825.70] Um, maybe...
[1826.84 → 1827.70] Maybe we can...
[1827.70 → 1831.66] Await our coordinated and effective response.
[1832.22 → 1835.32] So, I think we've got a pretty balanced take here.
[1835.42 → 1841.30] Compared to other system integrators who build expensive systems, um, their website could use
[1841.30 → 1847.02] some work, but their pricing on the super overkill stuff does not seem any more out to
[1847.02 → 1847.32] lunch.
[1847.32 → 1852.50] Um, with that said, there are probably some systems that have pricing that is pretty high.
[1852.50 → 1858.22] Um, it's well within the right of anyone in the media to have that opinion and express
[1858.22 → 1858.46] it.
[1858.46 → 1862.00] And threatening those people is stupid.
[1862.50 → 1862.72] Mm-hmm.
[1862.84 → 1863.94] So, that's cool.
[1864.14 → 1864.38] Mm-hmm.
[1864.38 → 1869.44] So, you went, and you had a not bad situation, and you turned it into a terrible situation.
[1869.44 → 1873.64] I would say your next hire, if you're selling so many systems that you have to raise your
[1873.64 → 1877.32] prices to slow the order, should probably be someone in, like, Marco.
[1877.50 → 1877.72] Yeah.
[1877.86 → 1878.10] Yeah.
[1878.96 → 1879.40] Systems.
[1880.14 → 1882.48] You need to stop communicating to customers.
[1882.56 → 1883.36] Yeah, that would be cool.
[1883.36 → 1884.72] Or media or anyone else.
[1884.76 → 1884.94] Yeah.
[1885.04 → 1885.94] Because you cannot handle it.
[1885.94 → 1886.92] Yeah, you should...
[1886.92 → 1889.66] You're taking it real personal, and it's just business.
[1889.66 → 1891.66] So, um...
[1891.66 → 1897.50] This also would have, like, just as a thing for anyone else watching, this honestly, as
[1897.50 → 1902.50] bad as it sounds, could have been very easy to handle in a relatively positive way.
[1903.16 → 1905.32] Um, you could talk about how...
[1905.32 → 1907.22] Because it seems like this, to be fair.
[1907.50 → 1909.18] Their whole name is Overkill Computers.
[1909.18 → 1914.26] They're probably not focused as a company on mid-range computers.
[1914.62 → 1914.70] Right?
[1914.70 → 1920.54] So, if I was them, I would just talk about how, like, our passion and our focus as a
[1920.54 → 1923.74] company is the things that they're putting out there mostly.
[1923.88 → 1927.68] Like, if you go to their Gaming PCs tab, the thing right next to the giant financing
[1927.68 → 1934.28] word is this crazy-looking computer with cool waterline or hardline water tubing.
[1934.48 → 1934.86] It's pretty overkill.
[1934.98 → 1938.90] That looks pretty overkill and is probably too hard for a lot of people to make.
[1939.40 → 1940.72] And if you're like, yeah, this is our focus.
[1940.82 → 1944.40] Sometimes we let old builds sit there, and GPU prices were really expensive for a while.
[1944.40 → 1946.66] So, things were cranked up, and it is what it is.
[1946.80 → 1948.28] They could have just said, you know, our bad.
[1948.34 → 1949.92] Yeah, we had some outdated builds on the site.
[1950.10 → 1951.08] Would have blown over?
[1951.28 → 1951.52] Yeah.
[1951.80 → 1952.12] Immediately.
[1952.50 → 1952.66] Yeah.
[1953.66 → 1956.70] Apparently, there are free entries on Gleam for the PC giveaways.
[1956.96 → 1957.24] Okay, cool.
[1957.24 → 1960.22] This is according to DawsonJ621 in chat.
[1960.30 → 1960.64] I have no...
[1960.64 → 1961.64] I haven't validated that.
[1962.24 → 1962.46] Yeah.
[1962.72 → 1964.80] And again, a lot of the details are...
[1964.80 → 1971.10] Allegedly, the main thing here is that is a very not good way to respond.
[1971.40 → 1971.58] Yeah.
[1971.76 → 1971.94] Yeah.
[1971.94 → 1973.08] It's a bad way to respond.
[1973.08 → 1975.98] The responses are the main things we're talking about.
[1977.20 → 1977.68] Yeah.
[1977.76 → 1979.84] Alex's discussion questions are hilarious.
[1981.80 → 1984.94] Bullying creators for reporting on your product is obviously wrong.
[1985.28 → 1987.78] Maybe compare to Intel's response when we crapped on ARK.
[1987.90 → 1988.10] Yeah.
[1988.54 → 1988.88] Man.
[1989.02 → 1990.86] They pulled out all the stops.
[1991.50 → 1993.42] They listened to us.
[1993.96 → 1995.34] They fixed things.
[1995.34 → 1997.02] They responded to us.
[1997.02 → 1999.56] Not just by email.
[1999.56 → 2004.68] By flying up here and bringing us a demo of the card working better.
[2004.68 → 2009.78] That is how you deal with negative coverage.
[2010.24 → 2014.08] That was like a lesson in how to deal with negative coverage.
[2014.40 → 2017.00] It turns the story around into a super positive thing, right?
[2017.26 → 2017.60] Oh, I know.
[2017.60 → 2020.10] If they were just like, yeah, honestly, that's just outdated.
[2020.22 → 2022.00] And our focus is these like six systems.
[2022.00 → 2024.44] You can turn it into a showcase of your cool systems.
[2024.44 → 2026.56] And now there's more people talking about your story.
[2026.66 → 2030.44] Like you could have turned this into a major sales opportunity and growth opportunity.
[2030.44 → 2034.78] But instead, you just kind of look like a baby.
[2034.78 → 2042.92] Well, I'm glad you said it and not me because I think you're like a little better able to handle the coordinated and effective response.
[2044.72 → 2045.68] All right.
[2045.82 → 2049.44] Why don't we move on to our next topic?
[2050.00 → 2052.06] What else did I say we would talk about today?
[2052.20 → 2052.78] Ah, yes.
[2053.34 → 2056.66] Discord on the Xbox if you're into a mild hassle.
[2057.12 → 2062.60] This was originally a report, at least the articles that we're using, by Ars Technica and IGN.
[2063.06 → 2064.32] And it's happened.
[2064.78 → 2070.44] The first console to finally natively integrate Discord is the Xbox.
[2070.86 → 2080.10] Owners of Xbox One and Series consoles will be able to connect with their friends through Discord voice chat on the systems themselves.
[2080.44 → 2086.00] Now, we actually tried to do this like six months ago or something like that.
[2086.18 → 2087.60] Yeah, because it's quite a while ago.
[2087.74 → 2090.86] I'm pretty sure I've heard talk about Discord on consoles for a while.
[2090.86 → 2094.52] We had the Xbox in like the dev mode that allows you to run emulators and other.
[2094.52 → 2097.84] And we tried to run Discord in a browser or something like that.
[2097.84 → 2102.66] But the problem was that the browser didn't have access to the audio devices and blah, blah, blah.
[2102.72 → 2103.44] We didn't manage.
[2103.50 → 2105.92] We got the app working in the browser.
[2106.08 → 2109.84] But we did not manage to actually make a voice call.
[2110.02 → 2110.12] Yeah.
[2110.12 → 2112.02] But now it's there.
[2112.16 → 2118.28] The option is available to Xbox Insider users and calls must be initiated and handed off from a smartphone.
[2118.94 → 2123.38] With many annoying steps through both the Discord app and the Xbox app.
[2123.78 → 2124.50] That's wacky.
[2124.76 → 2126.16] At least you can do it.
[2126.36 → 2127.38] It's a little wacky.
[2127.38 → 2127.58] Yeah.
[2128.02 → 2130.06] You got to transfer over to your Xbox.
[2130.70 → 2131.06] Okay.
[2131.20 → 2132.14] So I call you on my phone.
[2133.00 → 2133.18] Yeah.
[2133.28 → 2133.58] Go ahead.
[2134.78 → 2138.98] There's a note in here that makes a lot of sense or that is very interesting.
[2139.24 → 2140.30] And I talked about Discord.
[2140.50 → 2142.20] I was like, yeah, we talked about Discord on consoles.
[2142.92 → 2146.10] Discord walked away from a Microsoft attempt to purchase them for $10 billion.
[2147.32 → 2148.22] Last year, allegedly.
[2148.44 → 2148.56] Sure.
[2148.78 → 2148.94] Yeah.
[2149.10 → 2149.24] Sure.
[2150.76 → 2152.76] And I think that's where I had that in my head from.
[2152.90 → 2154.70] So, yeah, I guess it wasn't on there previously.
[2154.70 → 2156.18] It's just that they wanted to buy them.
[2156.18 → 2163.84] So, it's weird that last year, Sony bought a minority stake in Discord and said we'd see the fruits of their collaboration early this year.
[2164.34 → 2169.26] It looks like they lost the race unless maybe there's like a much better app coming on PlayStation.
[2169.28 → 2170.98] Yeah, maybe you don't have to call them first on your phone.
[2171.00 → 2172.16] Yeah, I'd require you to call on their phone.
[2172.46 → 2176.72] Either way, this is absolutely a step in the right direction.
[2176.98 → 2180.92] But I think Jonathan Horst's discussion question kind of hits the nail on the head.
[2180.92 → 2192.58] Why aren't there just APIs that allow the Xbox and PlayStation to support third-party chat applications like, you know, already, like ages ago?
[2192.70 → 2194.00] They're just computers, bro.
[2194.62 → 2201.24] Yeah, to be fair, up until the last like two or three years, I probably wouldn't have considered it as a console manufacturer.
[2201.24 → 2201.50] Why?
[2203.28 → 2204.38] And why now?
[2204.56 → 2206.00] There's very little cross-platform.
[2206.58 → 2206.98] Okay.
[2207.18 → 2210.18] So, you're just playing with other Xbox people or other PlayStation people.
[2210.32 → 2211.02] Sure, that's fair.
[2211.04 → 2215.30] Cross-platform is much more a more recent thing.
[2216.30 → 2224.32] We've been talking about it for a super long time, but it's actually hitting like big popularity and actually being a thing that people are very actively doing is quite more recent.
[2224.34 → 2226.62] Like this critical mass kind of.
[2226.82 → 2227.08] Yeah.
[2227.30 → 2229.00] And they actually had pretty good voice chat.
[2229.00 → 2237.92] Like I remember voice chat back in, you can meme about what the lobbies were like, but I remember voice chat back in like Xbox 360 days was quite functional.
[2238.24 → 2241.56] And like if you had the actually good headset, like it worked pretty well.
[2241.62 → 2242.88] Like they had their own thing going.
[2242.88 → 2255.38] And I bet you in a way for some people in the company, allowing access to things that isn't their own voice chat was probably seen as like somewhat of a forfeiture of that.
[2255.98 → 2256.94] That ecosystem.
[2257.20 → 2257.38] Yeah.
[2257.58 → 2260.52] That's just a nice word for walled garden.
[2260.76 → 2261.02] Yeah.
[2261.36 → 2261.76] Yeah.
[2262.14 → 2266.98] But like, I think this is the right move, but it might not have been the most comfortable thing for some people.
[2266.98 → 2267.30] Yeah.
[2267.44 → 2273.30] I guess it also means that you're losing some control over the experience users are having on your platform.
[2273.64 → 2280.86] Like if you have, you know, you look at games, for example, will sometimes have a message that pops up if you enable voice chat and online play.
[2280.94 → 2285.82] That'll be like, yeah, the SRB rating for this is kind of out the door as soon as you're interacting with other users.
[2285.82 → 2289.50] Because we can't control if they're going to talk about, you know, dildos or whatever.
[2289.96 → 2290.32] Sure.
[2291.10 → 2292.06] So, okay.
[2292.18 → 2292.78] All right.
[2292.90 → 2294.58] I guess I get it.
[2294.64 → 2299.02] This might also like if I was a, I don't know what this job title would be, but I'm sure it's a thing.
[2299.02 → 2307.82] If it was like a game and community experience person at Xbox, I might be concerned about a reduction in actual voice chat activity.
[2308.78 → 2312.58] Because there's, I'm assuming this can run in the background while you play other games.
[2312.58 → 2312.76] Yeah.
[2312.76 → 2313.58] Because it sort of has to.
[2313.94 → 2318.76] So I think this would increase the amount of people that would just sit in lobbies with other people, their friends.
[2318.76 → 2325.54] While playing other games and not joining the like native voice chat for games, if they're playing multiplayer games.
[2325.68 → 2334.98] So that might reduce the usage of voice chat in games, which might be a positive in regard to the whole rating thing you were just talking about.
[2335.06 → 2338.86] But might be a negative in regard to engagement and stuff like that.
[2338.86 → 2340.64] Quantum Rand says there are APIs.
[2341.02 → 2342.12] This is over in Float plane Chat.
[2342.44 → 2346.18] Super Mario Odyssey multiplayer mod has actually implemented them for proximity voice chat.
[2346.92 → 2347.78] That's pretty cool.
[2347.78 → 2350.42] Yeah, I don't think that's really what.
[2350.70 → 2354.96] And apparently Xbox apps have full access to the Windows UWP APIs.
[2355.10 → 2359.26] And the problem is that Discord and most chat apps were made primarily as browser apps and not native apps.
[2359.34 → 2361.26] This is Borg 666 in Float plane Chat.
[2361.80 → 2364.04] So there's a little more to it than we thought.
[2364.20 → 2364.34] Yeah.
[2364.50 → 2367.34] But it's clear that there just wasn't a focus on this.
[2367.34 → 2373.70] And I think, Luke, you're probably right that that was down to the lack of demand due to the lack of cross play apps.
[2373.76 → 2377.86] And if you have just a native chat app, well, why do you need a separate one?
[2378.40 → 2383.72] I remember actually feeling like that when my group and I used to play Left 4 Dead all the time.
[2383.78 → 2385.46] I was like, oh, the game has kind of built-in chat.
[2385.52 → 2387.04] Why do we bother with this mumble server?
[2387.66 → 2389.00] And then we would play other games.
[2389.08 → 2390.44] I'd be like, oh, OK, we need it.
[2390.44 → 2391.80] Also, the quality was better.
[2391.90 → 2393.32] The latency was lower, et cetera, et cetera.
[2393.52 → 2396.98] But I can definitely see that perspective.
[2397.14 → 2399.08] OK, we already have a perfectly working solution.
[2399.18 → 2400.16] Do we really need another one?
[2400.32 → 2401.72] The answer is yes, apparently.
[2401.86 → 2402.30] So that's good.
[2402.96 → 2404.74] We should probably do a couple merch messages.
[2404.88 → 2406.48] Colton, you got anything lined up for us?
[2408.94 → 2410.10] He's a little slow.
[2410.10 → 2410.38] He's new to this.
[2414.02 → 2414.72] All right.
[2414.88 → 2415.20] Colton.
[2415.38 → 2415.78] I'm here.
[2415.86 → 2416.00] I'm here.
[2416.10 → 2416.38] Colton.
[2416.38 → 2421.10] So Austin asks, what are your biggest concerns about the 40 series cards from NVIDIA?
[2421.68 → 2431.60] I mean, people putting them in cases that were not designed to dissipate, you know, 400, 450, 500 watts of GPU.
[2431.92 → 2432.50] I've been thinking about this.
[2432.50 → 2433.04] It's putt.
[2433.08 → 2436.84] A lot of these, like, tempered glass everywhere cases are going to have some troubles.
[2437.60 → 2437.88] Yeah.
[2437.96 → 2440.68] We actually need, like, more old school style cases.
[2440.68 → 2442.14] I was going to say, how ironic would that be?
[2442.14 → 2449.46] If you can't have, like, a last generation case, but you're fine as long as you have a brand new one or an ancient one.
[2449.82 → 2451.60] Like, you pull out your CM.
[2451.94 → 2452.54] What's the?
[2452.76 → 2455.74] You go back to those cases with the huge, like, 300 mid.
[2455.80 → 2456.30] Here, here, here.
[2456.36 → 2456.80] I got one.
[2456.86 → 2457.76] I got one for you.
[2457.90 → 2458.22] Side case fans.
[2458.32 → 2459.92] I got one for you, buddy.
[2461.02 → 2463.24] How about you pull out the Stacker 830?
[2463.54 → 2464.78] Look at this boy.
[2465.32 → 2465.68] Yeah.
[2465.90 → 2466.96] Look at this boy.
[2468.16 → 2469.48] It's got some colon.
[2469.48 → 2477.56] Yeah, because there was a while there in, like, case design where it was very fashionable to just have as many fan slots as you could possibly have.
[2477.60 → 2477.86] Yeah, yeah.
[2478.06 → 2479.38] This was, like, pre-tempered glass.
[2479.60 → 2482.34] This was actually kind of, in my opinion, a dark age of case design.
[2482.84 → 2485.24] That's absolutely my biggest concern, though.
[2485.50 → 2485.92] Oh, yeah.
[2486.00 → 2487.74] And there's going to be a lot of people.
[2487.86 → 2491.88] Man, we should probably do an updated how to water cool your GPU video.
[2492.02 → 2494.80] The last time we did that, we were still working out of the Langley house.
[2494.88 → 2496.18] That was, like, seven, eight years ago.
[2496.18 → 2513.30] And I think this generation, there's going to be a lot more people water cooling their GPU because there's just, it's infeasible to cool that kind of power output in that kind of form factor.
[2513.60 → 2519.66] I think we're also going to see a lot of systems damaged in shipping because you're going to have these crazy heavy GPUs.
[2519.66 → 2525.86] You're going to have some system integrators or even just end users who are moving or something, you know, try to ship it to themselves.
[2526.08 → 2528.34] And it's going to rip the PCI Express slot off their motherboard, right?
[2528.34 → 2529.70] Get that graphics card out of there.
[2531.12 → 2532.30] Move with it separately.
[2535.48 → 2537.32] Colton, come on.
[2537.44 → 2537.94] Sorry about that.
[2537.94 → 2538.82] He's perfect at other stuff.
[2538.82 → 2539.08] I got it.
[2539.08 → 2539.34] I got it.
[2539.36 → 2539.58] I got it.
[2539.66 → 2540.18] I swear.
[2540.66 → 2542.26] Peter says, hi, Linus and Luke.
[2542.26 → 2546.48] I'm curious if you're considering making LMG's auto bench program open source.
[2546.70 → 2549.80] It would be great to allow for the community to use and contribute to the program.
[2550.08 → 2550.54] Love the show.
[2551.18 → 2552.98] Right now, that is not the plan.
[2553.62 → 2562.28] Right now, the lab is going to be quite literally an eight figure investment by the time we are done building it.
[2562.28 → 2572.28] I intend for that eight figure investment to be a competitive advantage for our technology analysis.
[2572.70 → 2578.88] With that said, in the longer term, that is not impossible.
[2579.78 → 2591.22] And I think that a sensible approach could be something along the lines of free for personal use, but license fee for commercial use or something like that.
[2591.22 → 2592.14] Logo splatter.
[2592.28 → 2597.80] But for us to get to that point, there's a lot of work to do.
[2598.28 → 2602.30] It's not ready for prime time.
[2602.40 → 2603.92] It's not ready to be out there.
[2604.04 → 2609.70] It still requires the developer to brief the writers on how to use it.
[2609.86 → 2611.02] There's no documentation.
[2611.64 → 2613.00] It doesn't even have a GUI yet.
[2613.46 → 2616.82] So there's a lot of stuff for us to figure out.
[2616.96 → 2618.12] It's coming really fast.
[2618.74 → 2621.30] He's barely even been at the company.
[2621.30 → 2622.76] He's not even off probation yet.
[2622.76 → 2623.82] And it's already functioning.
[2624.08 → 2624.32] Yeah.
[2624.48 → 2625.26] Like it's great.
[2625.38 → 2625.56] Yeah.
[2625.92 → 2626.82] Great job.
[2626.82 → 2628.20] Like the labs team is going.
[2628.38 → 2629.38] They're going hard.
[2629.98 → 2634.10] But that doesn't mean that it's like a finished product ready for us to package up and sell.
[2634.30 → 2636.02] It's also a low priority for us.
[2636.16 → 2640.44] Priority number one is having the lab functioning.
[2640.44 → 2645.58] Then we're going to start figuring out, okay, you know, what's our go-to-market strategy for this tool?
[2645.58 → 2646.36] What do we do with these things?
[2646.36 → 2647.68] How do we document these processes?
[2647.68 → 2657.60] Because I do understand that a critical, critical component of this type of analysis is that we publish our methodologies.
[2657.82 → 2660.94] Because if we don't publish our methodologies, then how can you trust them?
[2660.94 → 2666.38] But GPU bench, for example, or whatever we're calling it, auto bench, auto bench, I don't know.
[2666.60 → 2669.44] We'll find some name if we ever actually commercialize it.
[2669.50 → 2671.16] We'll find some name that's not already taken.
[2671.54 → 2685.32] So whatever it is we're calling it, if that ends up becoming a product at some point, well, it's not really something that people need to see the code for in order to replicate our results.
[2685.32 → 2692.80] It'll just take longer because all it does is run benchmarks that are already accessible to you or to you or to me, but it does them automatically.
[2693.20 → 2706.82] So it's not like some of our other tools where, yeah, we're going to disclose exactly what microphones and exactly what fake head thing we're going to use to test headphones so that our results can be validated by independent third parties.
[2706.82 → 2716.74] It also works in a pretty specific way where it's designed to output things into a specific database that works with Grafana and all this other type of stuff.
[2716.88 → 2725.80] That's probably not what someone would want for a just take it home and do it yourself, like average user type situation.
[2728.56 → 2729.82] So, yeah.
[2730.62 → 2731.78] We also don't want to support it.
[2732.70 → 2732.90] Yeah.
[2732.90 → 2735.14] Good question in the float plane chat, though.
[2735.28 → 2739.12] Alain asks, what are the lab's KPIs from your perspective?
[2739.26 → 2741.18] What would you call a success, and what would you call a failure?
[2741.62 → 2744.20] I laid this out pretty well on the forum.
[2746.92 → 2751.18] I mean, I have no idea if I'm actually even going to be able to find this post, unfortunately.
[2752.48 → 2755.30] No, I can't really find it.
[2755.30 → 2759.84] But I pretty much laid out everything that I expect from the lab.
[2759.84 → 2765.68] Obviously, I would like a return on the investment in the long term, but that can come in a lot of different forms.
[2765.80 → 2767.44] It could come in the form of affiliate revenues.
[2767.76 → 2771.56] It could come in the form of video content for LTT.
[2771.78 → 2774.06] It could come in the form of video content for other channels.
[2774.60 → 2781.40] For now, I think Gary probably put it best when we had him on the show to introduce our head of the lab.
[2781.94 → 2784.96] And what he said was, our goal is to not be questioned.
[2784.96 → 2788.88] So I would like to elaborate on that a little bit.
[2788.96 → 2790.92] We absolutely want to be questioned.
[2791.24 → 2797.14] But when the questioning is done, we want people to come away saying, well, that was satisfactory.
[2797.40 → 2799.18] To not be questioned is not very scientific.
[2799.54 → 2800.04] Yeah, yeah.
[2800.30 → 2802.66] But I understand what he meant.
[2802.78 → 2805.02] And I think his heart was absolutely in the right place.
[2805.14 → 2812.06] Our goal is to build trust to the point where you should still question us,
[2812.06 → 2814.86] but you might not feel like you have to at a certain point.
[2815.42 → 2816.90] That's what we want to do.
[2819.98 → 2820.56] All right.
[2824.66 → 2827.82] Okay, Colton, you're typing as me in the float plane chat.
[2827.90 → 2828.54] What's going on here?
[2829.14 → 2830.44] Can I ask more questions?
[2830.52 → 2832.14] Yeah, you can ask more questions.
[2832.78 → 2833.36] Okay, cool.
[2833.72 → 2837.00] So Shadow says, can't wait to try the shorts.
[2837.08 → 2838.68] I've loved every product I've gotten from you all.
[2838.68 → 2841.94] What product other than the socks are you most excited to be working on?
[2842.06 → 2845.52] The socks are going to be big.
[2845.72 → 2846.80] If we ever make them.
[2847.28 → 2849.90] I'm very excited about our cable management product.
[2850.04 → 2852.42] That's one of those where for screwdrivers,
[2852.52 → 2855.70] there was already a pretty good screwdriver that I really liked.
[2856.02 → 2857.42] I just felt we could do it better.
[2857.80 → 2859.30] For backpack, same thing.
[2859.42 → 2861.94] There were backpacks that were perfectly usable for me.
[2862.00 → 2863.54] I just felt we could do it better.
[2864.50 → 2867.46] With cable management, cable management sucks.
[2868.02 → 2868.94] Like it just sucks.
[2868.94 → 2869.82] All of it sucks.
[2869.92 → 2870.38] No offence.
[2870.38 → 2872.80] Once you make cable management stuff, keep up the good work.
[2874.10 → 2881.18] But yeah, I have never found something to go under the desk and hold things like power
[2881.18 → 2890.10] strips and power bricks and cables that are in a way that is quick and easy to add another
[2890.10 → 2891.98] thing to and quickly put back into place.
[2891.98 → 2896.08] Our cable management product is going to be sick.
[2896.48 → 2904.38] I've seen the near final geometry now for the power bar holder, and it is just awesome.
[2904.86 → 2905.66] It's so awesome.
[2905.76 → 2907.14] It's super easy to use.
[2907.40 → 2911.38] You just pop it into the thing and now your power bar is magnetic.
[2913.02 → 2913.98] It's awesome.
[2913.98 → 2914.46] Awesome.
[2914.66 → 2915.74] It's going to take some time.
[2916.62 → 2921.70] But when we finally bring it to market, I think that's going to be the kind of product
[2921.70 → 2924.02] that doesn't just sell to LTT viewers.
[2924.14 → 2928.26] That's going to be the kind of product that moves really, really well just on third-party
[2928.26 → 2931.38] websites like an Amazon or whatever the case may be.
[2933.06 → 2933.46] Nice.
[2934.80 → 2936.34] Building off of that, one more.
[2936.34 → 2940.16] So I believe it's Z, I believe.
[2940.36 → 2941.56] It says, let's go swimming, Tyler.
[2941.82 → 2943.86] Would LTT store ever have Linus sandals?
[2944.64 → 2945.58] Yeah, we'd love to.
[2945.70 → 2946.62] The problem is the cost.
[2947.06 → 2952.26] The moulding costs are going to be astronomical because you have to do different moulds for
[2952.26 → 2953.16] every size.
[2953.40 → 2956.34] So every model times all the different sizes.
[2957.40 → 2964.00] And it's just this astronomically complicated project that, frankly, how many pairs of sandals
[2964.00 → 2964.70] are we going to sell?
[2964.70 → 2968.10] Like if we made the world's greatest sandals, okay?
[2969.56 → 2970.40] A thousand?
[2970.54 → 2971.02] Ten thousand?
[2971.32 → 2972.44] Probably not a hundred thousand.
[2972.70 → 2975.56] So I think there's lower hanging fruit for us to focus on.
[2976.00 → 2978.22] Speaking of focusing on LTT store.
[2978.34 → 2978.60] Oh, yeah.
[2978.64 → 2978.88] What's up?
[2978.92 → 2982.36] I got an interesting comment in Flow plane from Never.
[2982.76 → 2988.34] Are there things in the lab's sphere of influence that you have decided to leave alone or to not
[2988.34 → 2991.30] bother with due to availability of data elsewhere?
[2991.30 → 2995.10] And I will add on to this or other potential complications.
[2995.10 → 2998.28] No, I don't think so.
[2998.28 → 3003.62] Because I wouldn't say that there's a surplus of data in any given category.
[3003.98 → 3009.92] Like you think TVs, you probably think like ratings is actually what they're called, which
[3009.92 → 3013.88] I learned only recently when we hired some refugees from there.
[3013.88 → 3019.62] You know, you think, I mean, power supplies used to be Johnny Guru.
[3019.84 → 3020.36] Like now what?
[3020.64 → 3022.28] Like Gamers Nexus is getting into it.
[3022.42 → 3024.72] But you think monitors, you think maybe what?
[3024.80 → 3026.90] Like hardware unbox, TFT Central.
[3027.06 → 3033.78] Like there's, in any given vertical, there's at best two, maybe three.
[3033.78 → 3038.32] Okay, TVs, you've also got Vincent To from HGTV Test.
[3038.44 → 3039.86] But like that's two.
[3040.60 → 3046.22] And there are a handful more, but I'd say in any given vertical, at most, a few, maybe
[3046.22 → 3048.18] a handful of trusted outlets.
[3048.58 → 3054.16] So I wouldn't consider that a surplus of data in any given category.
[3054.16 → 3060.48] I think that there's absolutely value to having multiple independent sources of this information
[3060.48 → 3062.00] so that you can make an informed decision.
[3062.00 → 3065.48] I also threw in there the other potential reasons thing.
[3065.58 → 3067.84] Because like one of them that we talked about was security.
[3068.88 → 3074.12] Yeah, something like antivirus is one that, you know, I'm looking at going, when we are
[3074.12 → 3079.98] done setting up the lab for all the hardware categories that we'd like to test from every
[3079.98 → 3084.18] angle that we could possibly want to test them, we could take that entire size of that
[3084.18 → 3090.14] organization and double it and barely even scratch the surface of testing cybersecurity
[3090.14 → 3090.82] products.
[3090.82 → 3097.02] Yeah, we had an applicant actually that was like perfect and really promising and
[3097.02 → 3098.60] was interested in security stuff.
[3098.68 → 3102.00] But it was just like, oh man, what are we going to do with this?
[3102.14 → 3106.86] And the other big challenge with security is that we are a for-profit enterprise.
[3106.86 → 3108.84] We need to make a return on our investment.
[3109.50 → 3112.54] And nobody f***ING cares.
[3112.80 → 3114.30] Unfortunately, yeah.
[3114.40 → 3115.44] I find it very interesting.
[3115.44 → 3117.62] Like, it's rough.
[3117.72 → 3125.60] You try and do any kind of content around cybersecurity software or privacy or data protection or anything
[3125.60 → 3126.22] like that.
[3126.24 → 3128.62] There's a couple of people out there that make it work, but like...
[3129.56 → 3131.92] Like the entire audience just goes to sleep.
[3132.02 → 3135.94] You can tell the effort level that goes into it for the amount of return that they get from
[3135.94 → 3137.64] it is like pretty rough.
[3137.64 → 3144.10] And I'm very happy that the people that do make content in that space make it and that
[3144.10 → 3145.00] there's some perfect people.
[3145.24 → 3145.74] But yeah.
[3146.82 → 3147.30] Yeah.
[3147.30 → 3153.76] Oh, in other LTT store news, we've actually got a couple of announcements for today.
[3154.08 → 3156.70] First up, can I just say, shout out...
[3157.90 → 3158.12] Oh.
[3158.88 → 3164.54] Is the graphic designer slash photographer in Ed's department off probation?
[3165.32 → 3165.84] No.
[3166.34 → 3166.70] Okay.
[3167.20 → 3171.34] Well, shout out probationary employee number 625.
[3172.14 → 3173.34] And also Bridget.
[3173.84 → 3174.56] Oh, yeah.
[3174.68 → 3175.92] Andy had a blast with it too.
[3175.92 → 3180.08] This was probably the most fun photo shoot that I have ever done for a new product.
[3180.28 → 3183.44] I actually just sat here and went through all of them because they're so funny.
[3184.22 → 3186.62] This was an absolute blast.
[3186.92 → 3188.20] We have swim trunks.
[3188.48 → 3192.90] They are inspired by like a GPU.
[3194.44 → 3195.66] How did you do that?
[3195.72 → 3197.08] Is someone just pulling on your shorts?
[3197.38 → 3197.86] Yeah.
[3198.14 → 3200.64] Jamie volunteered his tribute from logistics.
[3203.38 → 3204.18] That's funny.
[3204.18 → 3207.70] Oh, she did a great job of the...
[3207.70 → 3209.12] Anyway, sorry.
[3209.34 → 3214.44] We have a subtle like GPU block water channel inspired design.
[3214.88 → 3216.92] Zipper pocket in the back.
[3217.04 → 3220.76] Like I always freaking lose stuff when I'm swimming.
[3221.34 → 3221.90] It sucks.
[3222.04 → 3223.54] We've got pockets in the sides.
[3224.22 → 3227.08] It's available in black as well.
[3227.08 → 3229.06] This is great.
[3229.44 → 3232.26] I actually did not know that she was going to do this.
[3232.42 → 3233.10] That is amazing.
[3233.34 → 3233.36] There's another one.
[3233.36 → 3234.64] There's another one further down.
[3234.86 → 3239.48] Here's our probationary software engineer from the lab.
[3239.56 → 3240.04] I love it.
[3241.72 → 3242.20] Oh, yeah.
[3242.28 → 3245.24] Zippers on the side pockets as well because I hate losing stuff.
[3245.34 → 3245.44] Sorry.
[3245.48 → 3245.92] What's that, Luke?
[3246.02 → 3251.56] We have to be very specific about roles because the engineers protect the term in Canada.
[3251.88 → 3253.26] Oh, software developer?
[3253.46 → 3253.56] Developer.
[3253.88 → 3254.58] Software developer.
[3254.58 → 3255.52] Oh, okay.
[3255.64 → 3257.42] Someone internally told me it didn't matter.
[3259.54 → 3260.02] Okay.
[3260.26 → 3260.92] Well, no.
[3261.02 → 3262.90] I raised questions about it after the fact.
[3263.22 → 3263.40] Okay.
[3263.48 → 3264.20] Software developer.
[3264.96 → 3266.78] I'm pretty sure it does matter.
[3267.04 → 3274.38] Well, I think it matters if we are selling their services to a third party saying we have engineers working on it.
[3274.38 → 3282.94] Canada, the designation professional engineer and engineer can only be used by licensed engineers and the practice of engineering is protected in law and strictly enforced in all provinces.
[3284.20 → 3287.94] That seems pretty clear to me, but maybe there's some wiggle room with the services that you're talking about.
[3287.94 → 3289.44] I actually read about it more than that.
[3289.44 → 3298.10] It's like if you are representing the work being done as being done by a PNG, then they have to actually have the designation.
[3298.54 → 3298.60] Okay.
[3298.70 → 3301.04] But if you're just like talking internally.
[3301.32 → 3302.10] He is also like might.
[3302.26 → 3303.26] I honestly don't remember his.
[3303.46 → 3304.68] Yeah, I don't remember either.
[3305.06 → 3305.20] Yeah.
[3305.36 → 3305.50] Yeah.
[3305.50 → 3308.92] I've gone through far too many to remember at this point.
[3308.92 → 3313.68] Anyway, yeah, our very own swim trunks have arrived.
[3313.82 → 3315.50] Limited quantities available for 2022.
[3315.96 → 3319.42] So we have a classic black as well as the super fun blue with subtle water block pattern.
[3319.80 → 3321.60] And then we have another announcement.
[3321.92 → 3323.90] We have all these colours of cable ties.
[3324.02 → 3325.38] Some of them don't move so well.
[3325.70 → 3327.48] So now we have mystery cable ties.
[3327.82 → 3330.08] 50 per pack, $8.99 US.
[3330.48 → 3335.78] If you order more than one pack, you may get two or more of the same colour combo, or you may get completely different ones.
[3335.78 → 3340.08] But let's face it, you don't care because you ordered mystery cable ties.
[3340.24 → 3341.24] Good for you.
[3342.56 → 3342.76] Yay.
[3342.90 → 3345.44] Was there anything else that I was supposed to say about the store?
[3345.54 → 3350.94] So now's a great time to order something, send a merch message, and we'll go through some more of them before the end of the show.
[3351.24 → 3352.24] Colton will read them out for us.
[3352.28 → 3352.76] Thanks, Colton.
[3353.14 → 3354.60] I think there was also one more thing.
[3354.70 → 3355.64] Oh, yeah, right.
[3355.80 → 3356.02] Right.
[3356.10 → 3360.94] The last update on the store is that we did our backpack pop-up shop.
[3361.34 → 3362.16] I lied.
[3362.86 → 3364.02] Luke and I were both there.
[3364.02 → 3364.34] Yeah.
[3364.42 → 3365.90] Actually, Colton was there too.
[3366.02 → 3366.74] Yvonne was there.
[3366.84 → 3367.36] Bridget was there.
[3367.46 → 3371.42] I didn't know we were saying we weren't going to be there until Sancho when you said it.
[3371.54 → 3371.66] Yeah.
[3371.66 → 3373.08] So I was like, uh.
[3373.78 → 3374.64] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3374.70 → 3378.46] Well, the reason was that we didn't want it to turn into just like a meetup.
[3378.56 → 3378.72] Yeah.
[3379.24 → 3380.94] With like a bunch of look-loos.
[3381.04 → 3382.64] We wanted to keep it really focused on.
[3382.72 → 3384.68] We didn't really have parking or an event.
[3384.76 → 3385.16] Yeah.
[3385.34 → 3385.90] It was that.
[3386.46 → 3386.82] Yeah.
[3386.98 → 3387.34] Like it.
[3388.24 → 3388.60] Yeah.
[3388.70 → 3390.54] It wouldn't have made sense to be a big meetup.
[3390.80 → 3391.02] Yeah.
[3391.02 → 3392.10] It didn't make sense.
[3392.16 → 3395.98] So we wanted to make sure that it was just, it was small and mission accomplished.
[3396.24 → 3397.06] It was small.
[3397.16 → 3402.34] We sold about 50 backpacks, which was about double what I would have said my minimum goal
[3402.34 → 3403.74] to be successful was.
[3403.74 → 3408.58] Obviously, a few more might have been nice, but I'm good with it.
[3409.10 → 3414.08] And that is enough that sometime in the next few days, we are going to be opening up the
[3414.08 → 3420.80] floodgates because as far as I'm concerned, once independent verified reviews from actual
[3420.80 → 3425.06] purchasers of the product are in, and that's what you're looking at here.
[3425.18 → 3426.84] This is no longer a pre-order.
[3426.84 → 3429.04] This is now a backorder.
[3430.52 → 3435.96] I am really relieved to see what people are saying about it.
[3436.24 → 3442.40] There was no way that we were going to be able to influence in any way what people posted
[3442.40 → 3442.92] about it.
[3443.58 → 3448.62] But so far out of the seven reviews, and these are all people that showed up, there's one
[3448.62 → 3454.94] four star and six five-star reviews that do a great job.
[3454.94 → 3456.90] Actually, I'm kind of impressed.
[3457.38 → 3462.38] They do a great job of identifying all the things that we put a ton of work into for this
[3462.38 → 3468.84] thing and appreciating it as well, which is always really nice.
[3468.92 → 3472.32] It was actually kind of a wild experience because I've never done it before.
[3472.76 → 3481.18] Being there in person while someone is looking over the thing that you spent.
[3481.34 → 3484.68] I had a bit of a feeling because I talked to a few people like, oh, what do you think about
[3484.68 → 3485.76] it while they were holding it?
[3485.90 → 3489.82] And I had a bit of a feeling that they were trying to flatter me a little bit, even though
[3489.82 → 3490.88] I didn't work on it at all.
[3491.96 → 3495.88] So I wasn't 100% sure, but everyone seemed pretty happy with it.
[3495.92 → 3500.02] So I'm happy that the text reviews are coming in also positive.
[3500.26 → 3503.64] Yeah, because we have no influence over that whatsoever.
[3504.06 → 3509.96] I was actually talking to Bridget about it because she used to work for a decent sized Canadian
[3509.96 → 3510.70] clothing retail.
[3510.70 → 3515.18] And I was like, yeah, like as someone on the design side, is this ever an experience
[3515.18 → 3515.58] you had?
[3515.64 → 3521.02] She's like, actually, yeah, they would send us to a retail location.
[3521.18 → 3522.38] I think she said once a quarter.
[3523.02 → 3529.00] And so you would actually stand there face to face with a customer, them not knowing that
[3529.00 → 3533.68] you were the designer, like the one who worked on this.
[3533.90 → 3536.80] And they would stand there and go, yeah, I would buy this, except this is like horrible.
[3536.80 → 3538.24] What kind of idiot would put this here?
[3538.62 → 3542.42] And Bridget's like, yes, thank you for your feedback.
[3542.78 → 3544.54] I was like, oh, Bridget, no.
[3544.94 → 3549.78] Someone in Flow plane chat, by the way, asked, why are they not all verified?
[3550.96 → 3557.12] So we actually set up a different, what is technically a different store for the purchases
[3557.12 → 3559.88] of the backpack because we had a physical location in Canada.
[3560.00 → 3562.66] So we had to do transactions in CAD, Canadian dollars.
[3563.40 → 3566.24] So then we have them coming over here.
[3566.24 → 3571.58] Some of them are getting their verified tag properly because it's like seeing the accounts
[3571.58 → 3573.32] are crossing and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3573.44 → 3579.26] The people that don't have a verified tag, we're going to have to reach out to, because
[3579.26 → 3580.24] we don't actually control this.
[3580.34 → 3585.48] We have to reach out to the company that runs the review app that we have and send them proof
[3585.48 → 3586.82] that it's the same person.
[3586.82 → 3589.08] And then they can add the verified tag for us.
[3589.08 → 3593.16] Um, but we're not, we're not like spoofing verified tags or anything.
[3593.16 → 3597.24] So it's going to, it's going to take a sec because we're waiting for a few more of the
[3597.24 → 3597.96] reviews to come in.
[3598.00 → 3601.56] And then the people that don't have the verified tag, uh, we're going to send that information
[3601.56 → 3606.48] over to judge.me, which is the thing that we use, and then they'll approve it, and we'll
[3606.48 → 3606.70] be good.
[3606.70 → 3612.92] So it's very important to us that the feedback is real because the last thing we want is
[3612.92 → 3615.60] returns on a $250 product.
[3616.30 → 3616.46] Yep.
[3616.76 → 3621.84] We would much rather not sell it in the first place than take a return on it after selling
[3621.84 → 3622.06] it.
[3622.12 → 3624.32] That's not, that's not a lot of fun.
[3625.96 → 3626.96] All right.
[3627.46 → 3630.26] Uh, what else we got to talk about today?
[3630.98 → 3632.16] Is there any more mercy boys?
[3632.62 → 3635.66] No, I think that's pretty much it for the store today.
[3636.28 → 3639.72] Uh, Colton, do you have any, do you have a couple of merch messages you want to hit us
[3639.72 → 3639.88] with?
[3639.92 → 3641.14] And then we'll move on to our next topic.
[3641.26 → 3642.06] There's nine curated.
[3642.06 → 3642.34] I do.
[3642.44 → 3642.68] I do.
[3643.24 → 3643.70] All right.
[3643.76 → 3647.14] So Jacob says, been meaning to pick up cable ties for a while.
[3647.22 → 3647.90] A mystery bag.
[3647.94 → 3648.94] It is Linus and Luke.
[3649.10 → 3652.78] What's your pick for a competition game at the land?
[3653.46 → 3657.40] Oh, I want to play Halo custom edition for sure.
[3658.10 → 3662.06] I am like super, super jacked to play Halo CE.
[3662.16 → 3662.84] I knew you'd say that.
[3662.98 → 3663.26] Yeah.
[3663.52 → 3668.30] I don't know how much other people are into this, but I really like games that people
[3668.30 → 3670.92] don't really play being the competition games.
[3671.04 → 3673.12] Because I'm, I'm not all that interested in like, oh, okay.
[3673.14 → 3673.94] It's a two, what?
[3673.98 → 3674.98] 250 person land.
[3675.88 → 3680.00] Um, I'm not all that interested in like, what are the, the best players?
[3680.00 → 3680.24] Yeah.
[3680.34 → 3684.96] So, so there's five people here that play all together on a counterstrike team four days
[3684.96 → 3685.30] a week.
[3685.30 → 3688.86] And we're just going to watch them crap on everyone else in the entire arena.
[3688.86 → 3691.52] Like I, that's not fascinating to me.
[3691.62 → 3693.30] Um, even if I'm one of those people.
[3693.30 → 3693.62] Yeah.
[3693.76 → 3694.88] Because it's just like, oh, what?
[3694.96 → 3698.28] It would, so my like professional team just gets a pub stomp at some land.
[3698.28 → 3699.18] Like, okay.
[3699.26 → 3701.42] Maybe it's like kind of fun, but it's not that engaging.
[3701.42 → 3706.12] So I like having games that just nobody plays, which means I don't really want to tell you.
[3707.22 → 3708.00] It's a secret.
[3708.16 → 3709.02] Because I don't want you to practice.
[3709.32 → 3713.20] We've leaked a couple, one of the a couple of those on the show, um, like that.
[3713.66 → 3715.00] Um, but yeah, I don't know.
[3715.10 → 3718.30] I don't know if other people are as interested in that, but I like the idea of like, okay,
[3718.48 → 3720.72] basically no one has ever played this game.
[3720.80 → 3723.76] Let's see who can get the highest score in an hour or something like that.
[3723.78 → 3724.44] I'm super into that.
[3724.44 → 3729.14] Like one of the most fun experiences I ever had at a land party was my first encounter
[3729.14 → 3730.86] with Midtown Madness too.
[3731.30 → 3733.48] We played cops and robbers with a game mode.
[3733.54 → 3737.74] I had never heard of, uh, the game is super broken.
[3738.30 → 3744.02] So like the physics of like stealing the, the, the thing, I forget what it is.
[3744.02 → 3745.72] Is it like, is it money or something?
[3745.76 → 3749.12] I don't know, but it's awful.
[3749.34 → 3750.26] It's awful.
[3750.26 → 3755.60] Half the time the collisions, like you'll go flying across the map, and it'll be like,
[3755.64 → 3758.42] yeah, it didn't transfer ownership of the thing or whatever.
[3758.78 → 3763.60] And that kind of chaos is not fun in a competitive setting.
[3763.68 → 3767.08] Like when you're at home all sweaty, like I'm going to win.
[3767.22 → 3767.90] I'm going to win.
[3768.28 → 3770.06] You know, like that's not fun.
[3770.06 → 3775.46] But in, in a land environment where everyone's just like, you know, had too much Red Bull
[3775.46 → 3779.70] and like it has been up for so many hours, not really thinking straight anymore.
[3779.70 → 3782.84] It's like, ah, I missed.
[3783.62 → 3784.22] Got him.
[3784.34 → 3784.86] F*** you.
[3785.54 → 3788.56] You know, that's, it's just such a great environment, right?
[3788.62 → 3790.36] And that's, that's what I, that's what I want.
[3790.48 → 3790.94] That's what I want.
[3790.96 → 3795.28] You want the you want the land environment to be jovial, not like sweaty competitive,
[3795.48 → 3799.14] unless you're at specifically a sweaty competitive land, which isn't.
[3799.14 → 3799.18] Yeah.
[3799.18 → 3802.38] It's like a qualifier for some kind of like regional.
[3802.80 → 3803.52] That's different.
[3803.68 → 3803.84] Exactly.
[3803.84 → 3804.76] But that's not what this is.
[3805.34 → 3805.62] Yeah.
[3805.62 → 3808.08] That's, it's, it's not that at all.
[3808.16 → 3809.02] Not even a little.
[3809.58 → 3809.98] Man.
[3810.30 → 3812.96] I mean, like 1v1 Warcraft 1.
[3813.42 → 3813.82] Like.
[3814.20 → 3814.60] Like that.
[3815.08 → 3815.94] You shouldn't have said it.
[3816.64 → 3817.36] Well, whatever.
[3817.54 → 3818.48] I mean, we could still do it.
[3818.54 → 3819.38] But now people could practice.
[3819.38 → 3821.46] Now people are going to spend a week practicing Warcraft 1.
[3821.72 → 3821.74] Yeah.
[3821.74 → 3824.70] And then when we play Warcraft 2, they're going to be like, oh, crap.
[3824.70 → 3825.02] Hey.
[3825.02 → 3828.34] But yeah, exactly.
[3828.46 → 3831.60] You just, just whip something out that like nobody's expecting.
[3833.90 → 3834.52] All right.
[3835.20 → 3836.60] This one comes from Graham.
[3837.16 → 3837.80] Hi, Lions and Luke.
[3837.84 → 3838.64] Hope you're doing well today.
[3838.74 → 3843.20] I was wondering if LMG would make a dedicated workshop channel that would focus on prosumer
[3843.20 → 3846.08] maker equipment and making things for videos or the lab.
[3847.66 → 3848.10] No.
[3849.58 → 3850.02] Cool.
[3850.48 → 3853.26] Um, I can, I can elaborate on that a little bit more.
[3853.42 → 3853.66] Sorry.
[3853.66 → 3854.10] Yeah.
[3856.84 → 3859.14] Maker content is super niche.
[3859.50 → 3867.82] Um, there are absolutely less niche verticals for us to go after before we would do that
[3867.82 → 3870.38] in the very, very long term.
[3870.38 → 3875.98] I would say it's not impossible, but honestly, I would go for software tips and tricks and tutorials
[3875.98 → 3882.94] before I would go for maker content in terms of, okay, like how to fix weird, like errors
[3882.94 → 3889.04] in windows or like how to, how to fix your audio devices in, in chat apps or whatever else.
[3889.04 → 3890.50] Like no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3890.50 → 3901.20] There are views to be had and software, software is a category with so much money to be spent
[3901.20 → 3907.88] and absolutely nobody who is like a major player in the influencer space.
[3908.76 → 3910.04] So no, no, no, no.
[3910.08 → 3912.82] From a business standpoint, it makes sense.
[3913.14 → 3916.84] Colton, how many software sponsorships could you sell?
[3917.04 → 3917.54] A lot.
[3917.54 → 3918.38] Yeah.
[3919.88 → 3924.78] Um, kind of similar is question from Loan, uh, long time viewer, first time caller.
[3925.20 → 3927.68] Do you ever think about doing a consumer devices channel?
[3927.78 → 3931.98] You get the occasional vacuum sponsor, and it'd be neat to see unbiased versions of those.
[3931.98 → 3939.12] yes I absolutely think for the same reasons that's a little bit farther down the line but
[3939.12 → 3943.80] i I think that that's totally something that we would be set up to handle we've got a lot of new
[3943.80 → 3948.38] stuff on our plate right now yeah there's just oh man there's just so there's more than enough to do
[3948.38 → 3954.44] yeah there's so there's just so much if there's just so much like creating a benchmark suite for
[3954.44 → 3963.40] a robot vacuum is like oh my god like you okay so what it's probably honestly it's probably less work
[3963.40 → 3970.26] and less investment to just go buy a fucking house versus like trying to build a benchmark house
[3970.26 → 3975.84] right and then so what's your what's your benchmark you just have a bunch of dogs that
[3975.84 → 3981.70] live there it's like a dog house, so the dogs just like run around you donate yeah you don't around
[3981.70 → 3985.66] the house you donate to an animal rescue, but you're like every once in a while we're gonna
[3985.66 → 3989.52] freak them all out by vacuuming yeah but other than that yeah exactly other than that it's going to be
[3989.52 → 3994.70] great so then what you do like uh you lick the cushions and kind of go how much hair for my tongue
[3994.70 → 4000.76] they get all the hair like it's these are legitimate challenges right these are questions we'd have to
[4000.76 → 4006.58] answer in order to properly uh quantitatively evaluate these sorts of products it's non-trivial
[4006.58 → 4014.70] so um given the investment and given how few views categories like that yet I would say that that's a
[4014.70 → 4026.32] sometime later project not a tomorrow project yeah yeah all right what else we got here
[4026.32 → 4031.96] question for Luke I think this has been answered before but uh if you hold on do it better this time
[4031.96 → 4036.78] I just lost the message wait one sec wow this is from josh bell would have done it better
[4036.78 → 4042.62] yep he would uh hope you're enjoying vacation bell if question for Luke if you haven't gone to NCI or
[4042.62 → 4049.42] met Linus how different would your life be compared to what it is now uh it's a tough one because i
[4049.42 → 4054.76] Linus probably remembers this but I back in the day and even now to a certain degree but back in
[4054.76 → 4059.32] the day I always had like a million different things going on because I really liked having fallback plans
[4059.32 → 4065.48] that was like part of my whole thing I know you were doing like it consulting for like small
[4065.48 → 4070.72] businesses like even like network wiring up and drop ceilings and stuff like servers and stuff for
[4070.72 → 4076.74] my it was a lot of like little law firms and notaries and stuff like that because
[4076.74 → 4081.82] they by the way if you want to get into it, it's a pretty good customer to have because they're
[4081.82 → 4086.92] they're like security is extremely important and if they lose all their data they're just like done
[4086.92 → 4091.52] so they need to have perfect security they need to have perfect backups a lot of that
[4091.52 → 4096.32] comes into like yeah so it's its a good customer to have because you can set up a recurring contract
[4096.32 → 4102.40] with them money, and they have money um customers with money that's key customers with money and
[4102.40 → 4106.62] people that will come back because like if you're trying to start like a little tech company thing
[4106.62 → 4111.40] just like building computers for a few friends or like fixing your friend's computer every once in
[4111.40 → 4115.92] a while whatever is not going to be recurring you might get some good jobs at the very beginning but
[4115.92 → 4120.96] it's not going to sustain you over time so I was doing that uh I was in school for software stuff
[4120.96 → 4128.52] um i I had YouTube aspirations if you want to see the best video of all time you can see Linus and i
[4128.52 → 4134.42] deconstruct uh my video about a keyboard um that wasn't my only YouTube aspirations I had other YouTube
[4134.42 → 4140.04] channels um yeah I don't know I have no idea because I had a bunch of other stuff going on
[4140.04 → 4145.40] I was very much in a discovery phase at that time I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do
[4145.40 → 4150.20] and I had school going on as like a kind of guaranteed fallback there was also potential
[4150.20 → 4155.36] I didn't want to he's perfect at it, I'm not necessarily, but there was also potential I could
[4155.36 → 4159.58] have followed my dad's path and gotten into plumbing I would have had a fantastic teacher
[4159.58 → 4166.80] considering he is currently a fantastic teacher yeah there we go baby Luke look at him
[4166.80 → 4177.24] his baby Luke dude it's so donkey like I have this like white undershirt on if I remember correctly
[4177.24 → 4181.74] and you can see it oh I was just going to say how many buttons you have undone there yeah too many
[4181.74 → 4186.64] too many all right oh wow
[4186.64 → 4195.50] that's deep what was I doing my mom's filming this too oh no it's just completely oh it's just
[4195.50 → 4202.46] open that's okay that's okay sure I mean it's a little weird still the pretty clear uh the pretty
[4202.46 → 4211.48] clear like translucent white tank top it's not the I would say the little odd uh the most like
[4211.48 → 4218.54] professional presenter do you remember do you remember flip HDS no oh flip HD oh yeah yeah yeah
[4218.54 → 4224.44] those awful little cameras that NCI sold like a dozen of and I think we based on how
[4224.44 → 4228.22] quickly they were discontinued must have been one of the most successful resellers of yeah go ahead
[4228.22 → 4233.00] yeah I didn't buy one just to be clear yeah but I borrowed one from a friend and that was filmed on a
[4233.00 → 4241.46] flip HD in the kitchen um and was not a winner I'll uh Kanara Luna asks is that a bong in the
[4241.46 → 4247.88] background knowing no mother I'm going to say no yeah no it's an it's a large vase that's going to be a hard
[4247.88 → 4253.56] no yeah that question is common though there was a bunch of that question under that video or whatever
[4253.56 → 4260.54] yeah but yeah no it's not no answer is no all right such a go-up I guess you could call it that
[4260.54 → 4265.94] yeah I'll ask are there any collaborations with other creators you haven't done yet that you'd like
[4265.94 → 4273.56] to do in the future yes what what what you want to do a video again like you want us to collab
[4273.56 → 4281.16] you owe someone a video I owe someone oh yes I owe the spiffing Brit yes a t pc i know i know
[4281.16 → 4288.88] I know yeah it's been far too long uh like it's been like over a year yeah it's been over a year for
[4288.88 → 4296.54] sure i I owe the spiffing Brit a t powered computer uh I think it'll probably not have actual
[4296.54 → 4301.12] tea in the water cooling loop I think we would probably go for something more along the lines of
[4301.12 → 4309.06] like water dyed the colour of tea, but maybe we could at least have like uh like a kettle as the reservoir
[4309.06 → 4313.74] or something like that or integrate it into the loop so it like pours out the top of the kettle into
[4313.74 → 4317.50] the pretty into the CPU we'll come there are a lot of things you could do with it, you could also make
[4317.50 → 4322.76] it looks like there was like a thing where you could pour out tea, and it looked like it was coming
[4322.76 → 4326.84] from the water cooling, but it was actually not or whatever like or oh the whole system could be in
[4326.84 → 4333.30] the shape of a teapot and then like uh you could have like the uh the tubing come out the front
[4333.30 → 4337.20] and like look like it's pouring or something I don't know we'll figure it we'll figure something
[4337.20 → 4345.34] out but yes, yes we do need to do a tea cooled computer for the spiffing Brit yes so dude I know
[4345.34 → 4349.58] I'm sorry we will do it at some point it hasn't been forgotten it has been brought up a few times
[4349.58 → 4354.60] kind of here and there but other than that the truth is I don't watch a lot of YouTube I don't
[4354.60 → 4360.94] follow a lot of creators I respect the work that creators do because I do it myself and I know that
[4360.94 → 4367.58] it's not as easy as some people seem to think it is um but for me, it's more just like yeah you know
[4367.58 → 4373.82] you reach out and I'm kind of I'm chill I'm down to I'm down to work with people I don't really I'm not
[4373.82 → 4380.20] like a fan of too much because I don't really have time to consume it I'm just busy um so yeah i
[4380.20 → 4384.82] wouldn't I wouldn't really say so I guess if like I'm trying to think that's the only one i really
[4384.82 → 4391.16] thought of just because we said we were like who are my celebrity crushes you know if uh I mean
[4391.16 → 4395.28] everybody loves Tom Hanks you know Tom Hanks wanted me to build him a computer yeah build you a computer
[4395.28 → 4402.82] Tommy like no problem sure but I don't know there's you don't even look into the collaborations that
[4402.82 → 4413.16] you do next all right this one comes from Adam hey Linus I'm going to see the Backstreet Boys
[4413.16 → 4417.98] Tuesday night with my wife her and my first time seeing them live did you ever get a chance to see
[4417.98 → 4424.52] the Backstreet Boys live like you wanted to nope twice I'm twice the Vancouver Backstreet Boys
[4424.52 → 4432.28] date aligned with my own convention that I had to be at twice I had to cancel tickets I had already
[4432.28 → 4438.94] bought I thought it was only once no it was twice oh my gosh two times they were touring two times
[4438.94 → 4442.14] they were in Vancouver on the same day as Ltd
[4442.14 → 4449.36] yeah oh Ryan Reynolds I told yeah I totally do Ryan Reynolds I mean build him a computer
[4449.36 → 4451.72] and the other thing maybe both
[4451.72 → 4458.18] yeah that was chat's idea chat's idea was Ryan Reynolds yeah for sure no problem
[4458.18 → 4464.26] Charlie Sheen that's a little more controversial credible he hasn't been in the news recently i
[4464.26 → 4469.36] don't know if he's like powdered water cooling do you guys want any more yeah yeah hit me with
[4469.36 → 4473.36] one more all right this one comes from Ashley in the recent video about the intel arc series it was
[4473.36 → 4478.22] mentioned that it performs well in dx12 and Vulcan since wine and proton run Windows games through
[4478.22 → 4482.62] Vulcan I knew this was do you believe this card is a good value for Linux users thanks okay
[4482.62 → 4489.24] I don't know that's the kind of thing that I feel like Anthony is going to have to be given a week
[4489.24 → 4499.10] to go and deep dive on because DVD yes translates older versions of direct x into Vulcan and the
[4499.10 → 4504.58] really hilarious thing is that my understanding is DVD either works or is like on the verge of working
[4504.58 → 4512.18] on Windows so running through this like not emulation but translation layer could actually be
[4512.18 → 4519.22] a more efficient way to game than using like direct x9 or direct x10 directly that was a weird
[4519.22 → 4523.34] sentence I don't know the answer to that and that's not the kind of thing that we were going to be able
[4523.34 → 4529.52] to test in a very early preview like what we were able to do with shroud and tap last week but yeah I'm
[4529.52 → 4536.44] I'm into it is sounds super cool I just don't know the answer so I'm sorry all right why don't we
[4536.44 → 4544.18] jump into another oh my god I'm signed out of okay Luke pick a topic you need a topic do we have

[4684.90 → 4691.66] after a successful award-winning launch on PlayStation VR earlier this year moss book 2 a VR game that is
[4691.66 → 4697.60] worth checking out is now available on the meta quest 2 it lifts at lifts off the story picks up where
[4697.60 → 4702.24] it left off in the platinum selling moss book 1 video game why do you have to specify it's a video
[4702.24 → 4708.38] game you know this is really you know what let's start over polyarc thanks to polyarc
[4708.38 → 4713.48] for sponsoring the show hey colton make sure you send them the right time stamp here all right
[4713.48 → 4717.82] after us, and then he pauses again
[4717.82 → 4720.82] you got this
[4720.82 → 4724.68] okay, okay okay here's what we're going to do Colton
[4724.68 → 4729.60] hold Colton get that lower third out of here get that lower third out of here give me a couple merch messages okay
[4729.60 → 4736.08] let's just get a gap here we're going to bury this in the two-hour-long land show and hope they weren't watching live
[4736.08 → 4740.72] are you serious yeah oh okay yeah
[4740.72 → 4749.70] I'm not ready he's ready he's got this he's got this all right this one comes from anonymous
[4749.70 → 4754.60] in the years you've been hosting the wan show are there any topics that stand out in your memory as the
[4754.60 → 4761.66] most interesting or the most infuriating uh oh I mean I don't know team viewer calling me all the time
[4761.66 → 4768.64] and you know messaging me is pretty, pretty infuriating I'd say that NVIDIA's treatment of
[4768.64 → 4776.20] hardware unboxed was very infuriating that was infuriating and disappointing um I got really into
[4776.20 → 4784.06] discussing like anytime we talk about potential consumer like enthusiast use cases or virtualization
[4784.06 → 4790.96] I get kind of excited and into it like the first time I thought of like whoa you could use this server
[4790.96 → 4796.62] technology to have like a single computer in your house that powers all your thin clients and you
[4796.62 → 4801.88] could slice up the compute power as needed so if you needed like gaming here and homework there it
[4801.88 → 4806.80] could be dynamically allocated and that stuff has come to pass not in the way that I envisioned it
[4806.80 → 4812.46] but in like a know scalable business like sensible way so you know services like GeForce now
[4812.46 → 4818.08] or stadia or whatever else the case may be um so I'd say that's pretty exciting but no I don't know if
[4818.08 → 4822.12] there's like a specific time that stands out to me, you guys got to understand there are literally
[4822.12 → 4829.90] like are we over a thousand hours of wan show that exists like i I think at least yeah it's
[4829.90 → 4834.74] got it's got to be it's got to be up there I mean uh I don't think either you or I have missed a wan
[4834.74 → 4839.84] show in the last two years so that's like a long time a hundred times an hour and a half like that's
[4839.84 → 4845.64] a that's a solid probably couple hundred hours right there i topics that stand out to me, I remember the
[4845.64 → 4854.18] the oculus one was it I don't think it was when no i yeah when Facebook bought oculus
[4854.18 → 4862.58] that wan show yeah you were not impressed any and I wrote like a huge thing for it um that that was
[4862.58 → 4869.00] that was very memorable and then I think uh this is I'm not going to do uh ones that like bothered me
[4869.00 → 4872.86] I don't remember the exact word that they used but um the other one that I remember talking about a lot
[4872.86 → 4879.14] was like we had this I feel like it was recurring topic, but it was this idea of like having like
[4879.14 → 4886.84] robot wars on a football field I think we only talked about it once oh okay but like man video
[4886.84 → 4894.10] games IRL yeah whole yeah so where you're we're basically bringing together FPV drone technology
[4894.10 → 4901.82] and augmented reality and like you essentially the stakes would be so high it's like it'd be like
[4901.82 → 4908.70] paintball but for like flight video games because if you get hit by someone you'd have you'd have
[4908.70 → 4913.72] logic in these combat drones that would be like yeah you're that sorry that engine is disabled or
[4913.72 → 4919.22] well it'd be a motor, but that motor is disabled now good luck limping to the ground see you later so
[4919.22 → 4925.18] you could actually fall out of the sky and lose like a hundred dollars worth of damage to your drone
[4925.18 → 4932.22] like it's the kind of thing that you I mean what like maybe in Dubai you know you could create a
[4932.22 → 4937.38] an arena for this and actually get participants for it or something like that, but it couldn't
[4937.38 → 4942.74] possibly exist so it's at rocket league IRL this was pre rocket league yeah this is ages this
[4942.74 → 4948.18] was a long garage back in the garage yeah here in my garage with my knowledge
[4948.18 → 4956.92] one more really important question this one's from Ethan Linus what's your favourite type of cheese
[4956.92 → 4963.96] oh I'm going to be honest with you the best experiences I've had with I've ever had with
[4963.96 → 4970.36] cheese was when I was in Paris uh with my mother she took me there as a graduation present oh my time
[4970.36 → 4976.64] in Paris yeah and uh so we went for a couple of weeks it was pretty awesome a week I don't
[4976.64 → 4982.16] know it was some period of time and I was there with my mother so that was good uh to be clear I'm
[4982.16 → 4988.76] very close with my mother um and what we would do was we would just go get some baguette, and we would
[4988.76 → 4995.26] go into a fromagerie and get some cheese excuse me fro mage and we just we wouldn't know what anything
[4995.26 → 5000.78] was so we would just get like that's always fun half a dozen random ones I have no idea what I ate
[5000.78 → 5008.66] um but I would take the cheese and I would put it on the baguette and then I would LE eat, and it was
[5008.66 → 5014.62] delicious and nothing else like here has compared but I also don't go out of my way to buy fancy
[5014.62 → 5020.52] cheese here because we don't have forgeries um so yeah it was it was great yeah it was awesome
[5020.52 → 5032.48] yeah on France uh all right the show is brought to you by polyarc after a successful award-winning

[5090.82 → 5096.16] there 's's announcement trailers and stuff, and it actually looks really cool so all right uh
[5096.16 → 5103.28] here's some interesting news hive set out uh this is a smart home maker hive set out to
[5103.28 → 5113.26] fight climate change um through the production of more e-waste which is a novel strategy um here's the
[5113.26 → 5120.48] here's the message this is posted on Twitter by oh who are you sorry thank you for that putting our
[5120.48 → 5125.40] energy into what matters most hi Phil it's not easy saying goodbye to products our customers love
[5125.40 → 5130.98] but as a smart tech brand in the middle of a climate crisis we know our focus needs to change
[5130.98 → 5137.40] at hive we've got big plans to make Britain's homes greener so we've made the tough decision to
[5137.40 → 5143.72] discontinue our smart security and leak detection products and develop more smart home tech that'll get us
[5143.72 → 5152.30] closer to net-zero wow thanks hive what it's a truly courageous move
[5152.30 → 5161.18] can you imagine like to be clear okay yeah there are some allegations in the comments on here
[5161.18 → 5167.48] which are interesting to me uh there's a note that says in communication with customers hive claims to
[5167.48 → 5170.60] be a brand in the middle of a climate crisis that needs to change their focus
[5170.60 → 5173.88] by bricking discontinued cameras are they actually doing that
[5173.88 → 5179.74] uh are they bricking their devices shutting they're shutting down the servers yeah
[5179.74 → 5190.26] wow yeah that is I mean it's one thing to EOL a product right to stop supporting something to
[5190.26 → 5195.52] stop selling it but still support it or no I'm saying it's one thing to stop supporting it
[5195.52 → 5202.08] sure it's entirely another to claim that you are discontinuing support in the name of fighting climate
[5202.08 → 5210.54] change that is not what happened hive what happened was you didn't want to support it because it cost money
[5210.54 → 5220.82] and so you've stopped don't turn this into some kind of like white knight like green peace
[5220.82 → 5228.18] like message here that you're you're you're protecting the world what are you even talking about
[5228.18 → 5234.14] who do you think you are apple weird we stopped including chargers because well we just love the
[5234.14 → 5243.22] earth so darn much no, no that's not why you stopped including chargers that's a happy coincidental
[5243.22 → 5253.82] accidental benefit maybe, but that's not why you did it so wacky bloody hell that's such a weird
[5253.82 → 5260.48] move like did it literally a single person take that the way they had hoped I don't know
[5260.48 → 5268.82] yeah i really don't know very odd uh what is this
[5268.82 → 5280.28] all right um wow is that oh no we've got another really great topic this is cool
[5280.28 → 5287.96] lewis Grossman and Aaron wolf want your ideas to help get people back control of their own devices
[5287.96 → 5295.40] uh, so there are a couple of sources here there's uh fudo.org slash grants, and we'll get into a
[5295.40 → 5302.14] little bit more detail about this totally legitimate looking website later i it is legitimate
[5302.14 → 5308.94] Grossman assures me it's legitimate otherwise I actually would not be uh promoting it uh but lewis
[5308.94 → 5313.90] asked us to get the word out about the man and organization that quote kicked me in the ass to
[5313.90 → 5319.68] start a non-profit uh that non-profit being the repair preservation group or RPG which has been
[5319.68 → 5323.76] instrumental in furthering right to repair legislation thanks to financial grants from
[5323.76 → 5331.34] Aaron wolf uh founder and leader of futo's goal is to give no strings attached financial grants
[5331.34 → 5336.72] to high quality projects that are focused on tech freedom like they did for Grossman so wolf cold
[5336.72 → 5342.44] Grossman in 2020 Grossman hung up on him in typical Grossman fashion I was going to say
[5342.44 → 5349.72] why you have to be prickly like that man I mean like I love you but
[5349.72 → 5357.82] come on anyway hung up on him thinking it was a scam because and I quote who the
[5357.82 → 5363.20] randomly calls my store saying I want to give you no strings attached to your money that's fair
[5363.20 → 5367.64] which is fair that's fair which is fair we have to give him credit where credit's due a wolf called
[5367.64 → 5372.80] back and ended up giving Grossman a small loan of a million dollars sorry excuse me grant to start RPG
[5372.80 → 5378.04] helped him hire an attorney and walked him through the process so in two years uh Grossman says he has
[5378.04 → 5382.82] not once second guessed or even asked what I did with any of the million dollars he gave all he asked
[5382.82 → 5388.68] is that I do not sell out and keep doing what I'm doing so Grossman basically reached out to me to help
[5388.68 → 5394.54] get the word out because he doesn't want anybody else to hang up uh when they get a call fair enough
[5394.54 → 5401.62] and I mean based on the state based on the state of this grant's website like this looks like it's
[5401.62 → 5410.26] straight out of 1998 um yeah i i i would think it was kind of fishy as well so I wanted to
[5410.26 → 5414.04] defend it until I went to the home page and I saw that there's like effectively no padding between the
[5414.04 → 5418.42] words and anything are you on it right now yeah yeah there's just like the text just goes like
[5418.42 → 5423.68] right into the gorgeous definitely looks like a website created by someone who just like hands out
[5423.68 → 5428.68] million dollar grants casually um which is fine you know you want to put the money where it's going to
[5428.68 → 5434.48] be most effective yeah honestly yeah a gorgeous website is not the answer to that so
[5434.48 → 5441.64] cool um judo is asking uh judo is asking similar projects to apply at fudo.org slash grants with
[5441.64 → 5447.76] three basic requirements one is to be open source or have a roadmap to becoming open source two is to
[5447.76 → 5454.22] not have an exploitative business model so no data mining selling user data etc and number three is that
[5454.22 → 5459.58] you do not sell out to the tech oligopoly when they come and knocking which seems reasonable enough
[5459.58 → 5465.06] on the surface, but guys is probably harder than you might think to resist when that kind of bag of
[5465.06 → 5471.10] money shows up um one other example of the type of projects that judo is looking for is the privacy
[5471.10 → 5476.36] focused android fork graphene OS its makers are currently in funding talks with judo which
[5476.36 → 5480.48] hopefully I'm allowed to disclose well that's in here and Grossman will apparently be putting together
[5480.48 → 5485.66] a maker space with wolf near university of Austin over the next year a little more about Aaron wolf
[5485.66 → 5491.46] uh 18 year Silicon Valley veteran founded yahoo games in the 1990s had success as an entrepreneur
[5491.46 → 5496.88] and investor notably as a seed funder and early contributor to WhatsApp today though huh I wonder if
[5496.88 → 5500.98] there's any bitterness in that whole do not sell out to big tech with the whole WhatsApp thing yeah
[5500.98 → 5506.02] today though judo through judo Aaron is devoted to using his fortune and talents to give people
[5506.02 → 5512.16] back control over their computers and sovereignty over their technology cool um discussion question
[5512.16 → 5517.32] here uh courtesy of Riley Murdoch says more rich people using money to fight tech monopolies please
[5517.32 → 5524.42] k thanks I mean yeah I guess that's that's basically it so we're happy to we're happy to help spread
[5524.42 → 5529.62] the word uh if you guys have a project hey head over to fudo.org slash grants I assure you it is
[5529.62 → 5536.66] not as illegitimate and sketchy as it looks which is great because it's probably also just like very
[5536.66 → 5546.84] new well I mean um called Grossman in 2020 so the site though uh I don't know I don't know I could
[5546.84 → 5552.50] look into it but I honestly don't really care too much but archive but yeah if it's legit it's legit
[5552.50 → 5558.44] that's it yeah sounds good uh this is an info page like I don't know who cares
[5558.44 → 5564.78] oh crap we haven't even talked about whale land tickets I was going to say, or the robot dogs things
[5564.78 → 5570.02] that are not legit yeah the robot dogs you thought it was like fake or something I saw some posts about
[5570.02 → 5573.68] that, but maybe it was about a different video I don't know what we'll talk about it but whale land
[5573.68 → 5580.00] tickets first oh no we're doing this okay yeah uh a robot dog similar to Boston dynamic spot was demoed
[5580.00 → 5586.58] with an assault rifle just kind of thrown on top of it um there the video went
[5586.58 → 5593.74] uh pretty viral I think got a lot of views it was kind of everywhere for a while you can see it
[5593.74 → 5599.46] it's its very spot like it's its running through some type of patrol script there you can see it does
[5599.46 → 5606.14] have some issues with recoil um that could be fixed pretty easily if you just didn't put like a pyramid
[5606.14 → 5611.56] that you strapped a gun to on top of a yeah robot dog that was built for other things um and there
[5611.56 → 5616.16] are companies that have made ones that do look more legit I just don't think we've actually seen videos
[5616.16 → 5622.46] of them being used, but that doesn't mean that they don't exist um it looks like the technology dog that
[5622.46 → 5631.34] was used in the video is sold on AliExpress for about three grand um yeah um it looks like it's very
[5631.34 → 5638.50] likely of uh there are some suggestions that it might be of Russian origin because there was an
[5638.50 → 5643.92] insignia on the robot dog that looked like it was linked to something every single thing that
[5643.92 → 5649.36] links it to that origin could be done and put there by basically anyone so it means basically nothing
[5649.36 → 5657.84] um but yeah I don't know just throwing it like on top with duct tape is not the most elegant solution
[5657.84 → 5661.88] and I guarantee you that there are people making more elegant solutions that are better at recoil
[5661.88 → 5668.82] control and probably don't just use a firearm that was made for a human yeah taped on top of a dog
[5668.82 → 5675.40] yeah they use a firearm that was made for the dog properly attached to the dog so uh Jaden's saying hey not
[5675.40 → 5686.02] this please yeah it's happening regardless but yeah it's spooky it's just uh I don't think that
[5686.02 → 5690.08] necessarily the one in the video is the one that you should be yeah the one in the video is like
[5690.08 → 5696.10] relatively speaking not a problem um, but there are ones that already exist that are much scarier yeah
[5696.10 → 5701.16] uh Alex actually added a note to this uh Nicholas uh proof was the one who prepped it, but he says
[5701.16 → 5707.86] IMO this is way less terrifying than a drone strike this thing is super loud and I can outrun it by
[5707.86 → 5714.44] going downstairs like it's I mean you can't outrun a bullet but I get his point either way
[5714.44 → 5718.92] drone strikes are spooky yeah we're getting outside our realm here pretty quickly but like
[5718.92 → 5725.66] yeah it's uh it's a thing just if is that video was spooky just understand that that's pretty
[5725.66 → 5731.08] base level discussion question is in about a hundred years we've gone from riding horses into battle to
[5731.08 → 5736.90] drone strikes from a pilot hundreds or thousands of kilometres away uh what's next for modern warfare i
[5736.90 → 5742.08] mean I think that the answer is uh you know it's its all basically information it's all
[5742.08 → 5747.92] subterfuge it's all manipulation of public sentiment you can cause so much more damage to a country
[5747.92 → 5755.64] by weaponizing its own population than by actually just like stabilizing it by riding up in like a tank
[5755.64 → 5766.14] I mean to be clear tanks have their place, but it's um it's kind of like an after the fact roll in and
[5766.14 → 5771.26] seize territory type of situation where you've already kind of ruined that territory through the other means
[5771.26 → 5779.66] um also yeah yeah I don't know I don't want to give people ideas so I'm not going to talk about
[5779.66 → 5782.28] other things related to this yeah Luke has some good ideas
[5782.28 → 5790.12] it is something we talk about but I don't think it's going to be on the wan show no
[5790.12 → 5796.60] uh speaking of things that there was some debate internally whether to talk about on the wan show
[5796.60 → 5803.70] i you know I don't know how to address something like this in the right way because there just
[5803.70 → 5810.76] isn't a right way to address something like this but it's possible that online there will surface
[5810.76 → 5819.28] an email it seems to be being sent to our partners to our business associates like other media outlets
[5819.28 → 5828.14] it was copied to as many members of our staff as this individual was able to guess at and it contained
[5828.14 → 5838.74] some very uh serious allegations about me so rather than wait for this to pop up on Reddit and um you
[5838.74 → 5845.74] know to have people make assumptions I felt you know it's better for me to just tell you guys um what my
[5845.74 → 5854.04] take on it is and we can go from there so the email alleged that when I was 16 to 17 and this is from
[5854.04 → 5864.72] the alleged father of a daughter alleged that I raped a 12-year-old girl so that's pretty uh that's pretty
[5864.72 → 5875.10] heavy um to that I would say that's completely untrue and I sincerely doubt that this email contains any truth
[5875.10 → 5883.44] whatsoever um yeah if there's any if there's any um wait who wrote this no I'm not that's that's not
[5883.44 → 5889.98] no that's not a thing uh so anyway i will show you guys what I said about that internally because
[5889.98 → 5900.32] the basic bottom line of this is I have no idea what uh this particular person is talking about
[5900.32 → 5905.36] so let's go ahead I said hey everyone by now you've probably either seen or heard about the
[5905.36 → 5910.00] explosive allegations that were blasted out to most of the company via email the only way I know how to
[5910.00 → 5914.34] respond to something like this is with full transparency so for better or for worse here is
[5914.34 → 5920.96] my entire relationship slash sexual history I had my first kiss in the summer when I was 14 at an
[5920.96 → 5927.32] acquaintance's birthday party she tasted of cigarette smoke, but it was otherwise enjoyable I started my
[5927.32 → 5934.04] first relationship when I was 15 with a girl I met at bible camp I have redacted the name our
[5934.04 → 5938.84] relationship lasted about six months and while we kissed hugged touched we never had sex we were the
[5938.84 → 5945.48] same age I lost my virginity at 16 with my then girlfriend and high school sweetheart name redacted
[5945.48 → 5951.38] might have been 17 either way our relationship lasted until I was 19 we were entirely monogamous
[5951.38 → 5958.34] we were the same age I met Yvonne in my first semester at UBC we started dating in January of that year
[5958.34 → 5966.98] that is it so you know whatever people might think one way or the other you know is uh is
[5966.98 → 5974.02] two sexual partners enough for a man um that's it that's that's my that's my that's how many notches
[5974.02 → 5980.82] are in my belt not only do I have no idea what this person is talking about I can't even figure out
[5980.82 → 5986.98] who the supposed dad is talking about because in my life at that time there were no people who
[5986.98 → 5991.62] matched the description that was provided the daughter of an immigrant family four to five years
[5991.62 → 6002.10] younger than me that is literally no one um, so the discussion question here is as a public figure
[6002.10 → 6009.30] this is something that I've been aware of as an attack vector for a long time I mean wherever
[6009.30 → 6016.26] yeah um, and it's something I thought about, but it wasn't until now that I finally went okay so what do
[6016.26 → 6022.26] i what on earth am I supposed to do in this situation uh either you acknowledge it right away which is
[6022.26 → 6029.22] clearly the path that I've settled on um, but this has the potential to make me look defensive
[6029.22 → 6037.38] even worse if i you know go aggro on it, you know I pull out the is libel and I intend to defend
[6037.38 → 6042.66] protect my rights blah blah well that has the unintended consequence of potentially silencing
[6042.66 → 6049.62] legitimate victims of sexual assault or sexual abuse that is absolutely the last thing the last thing i
[6049.62 → 6057.62] want so I want to make it really clear that in acknowledging it i am not I'm not saying that this
[6057.62 → 6065.86] that this alleged supposed daughter is lying uh because she doesn't exist so it would be the
[6065.86 → 6073.78] supposed father of this supposed daughter that would be lying in this case um because just yeah I have
[6073.78 → 6081.62] no i I have no idea what you're talking about um option two would be to ignore it this has the potential to
[6081.62 → 6086.66] to make it seem like I have something to hide or I'm trying to sweep something under the rug so clearly
[6086.66 → 6093.14] I decided not to take that path um I think this person is probably getting at least part of what
[6093.14 → 6098.34] they wanted by hearing me talk about it on the wan show um I have to deal with that that's that's the
[6098.34 → 6105.78] unintended consequence of even acknowledging this kind of this kind of attack but the reason that i
[6105.78 → 6111.86] chose the path that I chose the path that I did which is full disclosure is that what it does is make
[6111.86 → 6118.98] it so that this is the last time that I ever have to acknowledge anything like this you guys now know my entire
[6119.62 → 6122.02] everything there is to tell so
[6124.26 → 6130.50] that's it that's all sorry I'm I'm not spicy um
[6130.50 → 6139.62] um very mild flavour pretty boring guy actually um it's kind of i was kind of an awkward
[6139.62 → 6142.34] I was kind of an awkward teen when it came to girls actually
[6144.74 → 6144.98] yeah
[6149.22 → 6155.94] edge tech on float plane says not sure what's more insane the defamatory email blast or line is sharing
[6155.94 → 6160.34] that timeline for the entire internet to see yeah I'm not sure either I just don't know what else
[6160.34 → 6165.62] to do guys the weird situation to be in yeah you have to ask yourself like what would you do in
[6165.62 → 6171.70] this situation if you had uh a company of people that are reading this and then looking at
[6171.70 → 6176.74] you and if you had a community of people that are watching your videos and potentially going to hear
[6176.74 → 6182.02] about it because the email blast went out to a wide range of people um you want to get out ahead of
[6182.02 → 6189.14] it yeah but like how do you do that you know I'd love to know what motivated it, but it's really tough
[6189.14 → 6194.82] because if there was is there was a grain of truth that I could build on then at least I could go okay
[6195.38 → 6201.94] maybe it's that particular grudge over that particular thing I said in a video or that
[6202.90 → 6211.46] that perceived slight against that that person that or and you know the truth is that I have not
[6211.46 → 6216.50] always been the nicest person in the world I've talked about it on the wan show before like I was pretty
[6216.50 → 6223.14] mean in high school um i have buried any hatchets that I had as an adult that's something
[6223.14 → 6229.78] that i I set out for myself to do um so i I don't think this is someone actually out of my past
[6230.66 → 6236.82] coming out of nowhere I think this is just an I think a fairly obvious attack vector yeah um so
[6236.82 → 6241.30] yeah what I'm what but what I was saying was if there was some kind of if there was some kind of kernel or
[6241.30 → 6246.26] nugget of truth in this that I could build on like if is it at least matched the description
[6246.90 → 6253.94] of someone who I had offended or wronged in some way then I might be able to i might be able to
[6254.50 → 6260.58] figure out what on earth is going on, but they're just there just isn't there's nobody in my
[6260.58 → 6266.82] life past or present who matches that description, so the email is also very clear that
[6266.82 → 6273.14] there wasn't going to be any information given um yeah yeah there was no there were no trails to
[6273.14 → 6285.22] follow like yeah um so I think I've said everything that I have to say about that and I think it's time
[6285.22 → 6290.58] for us to do some merch messages let's do it all right this one comes from Julian are there plans for
[6290.58 → 6296.10] add-ons to the backpack similar to the moss organizer nest or packing cubes that are appropriately sized for
[6296.10 → 6304.42] the LTT backpack packing cubes sorry packing cubes moss organizer nest you said yeah I think we've
[6305.14 → 6312.02] I've seen these before right oh yeah okay I'm looking at sponsor the Walsh oh add-ons ah yes yeah
[6312.02 → 6317.38] yeah we do have some add-ons planned um for the webbing on the front I think we want to do a phone
[6317.38 → 6322.90] holder which I've already had requests in person for now at the pop-up shop so yes we intend to do
[6322.90 → 6329.62] something like that and I think we are also planning an internal like tech pouch uh it's hilarious
[6329.62 → 6336.50] the that's the genesis of that product was Bridget showing me something that she had kind of gone rogue
[6336.50 → 6342.26] and had a sample created for and i I looked at it the first thing I said I was like sorry what is this a
[6342.26 → 6347.94] like a purse is this a tech purse, and she goes no it's not supposed to be that shape they sewed it wrong
[6347.94 → 6355.78] like oh okay it's supposed to be more like a jumbo pencil case, and then it unzips and like kind of
[6355.78 → 6364.10] accordions out um and man the latest prototype perfect not ready yet uh yes, yes stuff will happen
[6364.10 → 6378.26] what else you got all right this one comes from Alexandro uh yes they ask will oh my gosh hold on one
[6378.26 → 6385.62] sec will you make more mats and will you test tempered glass testing from computer cases so I'm assuming
[6385.62 → 6391.86] that's referring to the lab will we do tempered glass testing more mats like more desk pads yes there are more
[6391.86 → 6399.22] designs coming soon and will we test tempered glass from computer cases like for like shatter resistance
[6399.22 → 6406.98] or no I'm going to say I'm going to say no I mean that's a really cool rabbit hole to get down like the
[6406.98 → 6414.10] optical transparency of different manufacturers like side panel glass like who has a great you know
[6414.10 → 6418.74] anti-glare coating that makes it so you can see your internal components but I mean yeah sure cool
[6418.74 → 6426.58] if you want to start case panel glass reviews.com you go do that power to hit it up yeah i I love it
[6426.58 → 6432.50] but um no, no that is not a vertical that we plan to pursue at this time all right this one comes from
[6432.50 → 6438.50] kyle gamers nexus took a chance investing in a sound isolation chamber and fan testing while LTT is taking
[6438.50 → 6443.86] a chance with labs these moves prove your passion to the trade and are critical to the viewer based trust
[6443.86 → 6448.90] relationship thank you any plan any plans to collab more often with the new equipment
[6451.54 → 6456.58] I don't think the new equipment necessarily makes collabing easier there aren't a ton of tech creators
[6456.58 → 6465.22] like in bc, so a lot of people would have to like change countries to come check out the lab the
[6465.22 → 6472.10] lab stuff is not very portable I think other than referring to each other which we do and respecting each
[6472.10 → 6478.02] other and supporting each other they're awesome in public yeah those guys are great um super legit
[6478.02 → 6484.02] i yeah i I think that I think that some friendly competition in the space would also be great I think
[6484.02 → 6491.46] that we have the potential to push each other to be better um you know no I mean i I'm oh I mean one
[6491.46 → 6499.38] one collab that i have a verbal agreement from Steve from gamers nexus for is uh he says that once
[6499.38 → 6505.54] their place is totally set up I get to do a tour of it I get to make a video like doing like my spin on
[6505.54 → 6511.38] the gamers' nexus lab, and he's more than welcome to come and check out our space and do some gamers
[6511.38 → 6516.18] nexus coverage tell me if he thinks my team did a good job of building out our testing facility so
[6516.74 → 6521.14] i I think that would be that would be really fun but yeah no other than that not really
[6523.46 → 6528.58] all right this one comes from matthew asks will the display cable testing shown previously in
[6528.58 → 6536.42] videos be incorporated into LTT labs yes well, and it'll also be a critical part of the development
[6536.42 → 6541.54] of our upcoming cables which I know puts us in a pretty awkward position conflict of interest wise
[6541.54 → 6548.02] but if we just maintain our complete transparency then I think we should be fine that's something that
[6548.02 → 6553.70] you could maybe send it to other people to test yeah for sure, and we will my understanding
[6553.70 → 6558.98] is that other YouTubers have already expressed interest to their communities in reviewing our
[6558.98 → 6564.82] screwdriver and backpack which we would be more than happy to facilitate so if there's anyone who
[6564.82 → 6572.18] you know who you want to review those products let them know send them this clip assuming they have a
[6572.18 → 6577.22] sizeable audience I'm sorry if you have four subscribers on YouTube it's not like I'm not knocking you I don't
[6577.22 → 6581.54] want to go full artesian builds here you're not big enough to send you a screwdriver no, no it's not it's not
[6581.54 → 6587.14] about that this is not a prize it's if you are legitimately a reviewer slash influencer in that
[6587.14 → 6593.38] vertical then we'd be happy to at least explore sending you one or at the very least I know that some
[6593.38 → 6599.78] have said they do not want review samples they would rather just buy it we could give we could give you
[6599.78 → 6605.62] a like at that moment heads up so that in the first wave you'll be one of the first to receive your order
[6605.62 → 6608.82] so we could at least do that um yeah just let us know how you want to work it
[6611.70 → 6618.66] all right we got a merch message from anonymous for me wait a minute let's go thanks Colton for
[6618.66 → 6623.86] jumping in for the wan show did you send this yourself no, no hey no anonymous anonymous anonymous
[6623.86 → 6629.46] anonymous Colton question for Colton what is the best and worst parts of your work day you know the
[6629.46 → 6636.82] the best parts are getting to work with all these fine folks okay just showing up why don't you kiss
[6636.82 → 6643.86] some more ass Colton oh wow anyway I just like working here I'm sorry the worst part of my day
[6643.86 → 6651.06] is dealing with you right now I'm just joking I don't know it's a good one it's a good one all
[6651.06 → 6658.42] right I think that's all the questions I have yeah I appreciate you I appreciate you um Edmund says hey
[6658.42 → 6662.98] lily Luke and Linus love the show today what's a game franchise that you recommend to people
[6664.34 → 6670.66] a franchise I mean I'm super into yeah I love my beat safer love Anna depends so much what you're
[6670.66 → 6678.18] into yeah it's not for everyone yeah also franchise is like kind of specific because a lot of my favourite
[6678.18 → 6686.42] games are not a part of a franchise um yeah I don't know I can't think of a franchise
[6686.42 → 6693.62] franchise that isn't like super generic, and you've probably already played it um so I don't really
[6693.62 → 6702.66] have an answer sorry franchise yeah I don't know depends too much on what you're specifically into
[6702.66 → 6710.34] sorry as always it depends what you're into and I think that pretty much wraps us up for wan show today
[6710.34 → 6714.42] we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[6720.02 → 6731.54] I lost track of time and I'm going too late so I cut it
[6731.54 → 6743.06] oh Marian studios divinity yeah but then like I wouldn't necessarily recommend super high playing
[6743.06 → 6746.26] the old ones you just play the new ones you check out baller's gate which is coming out it looks
[6746.26 → 6759.94] amazing you should play divinity original sin too there you go
[6759.94 → 6760.02] you
