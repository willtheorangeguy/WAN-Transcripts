[0.00 → 8.32] notification was wrong apparently oops oh, and we're live welcome to the wan show the selected
[8.32 → 12.96] resumed extremely quickly today, and we've got a fantastic show for you today starting of course
[13.60 → 22.88] with the artesian builder scandal why would you take a big dump on your community members
[22.88 → 26.72] in public it's been really entertaining to watch I mean if you want to take a dump on your
[26.72 → 31.44] community members you should at least do it privately like Nintendo does so we'll be talking about both
[31.44 → 38.48] of those what else we got today Luke NVIDIA hacked DLS source DSS source code leaked uh and lots of
[38.48 → 43.60] other bad things yeah it seems to be a pretty substantial hack what else we got epic games
[43.60 → 51.04] bought Bandcamp I did not see that coming I don't know anyone that saw that coming oh I did what
[51.04 → 63.76] 100 I don't believe obviously it just made so much sense to roll the intro
[63.76 → 84.16] the show is brought to you by Squarespace the sonic and Zoho CRM all right let's jump right into our
[84.16 → 89.36] first topic actually I have a spicy take to start us off with what's the title of the show
[89.36 → 96.24] don't never hate on your community never hate on your community yes that mean you can't
[96.24 → 101.76] make fun of twitch chat anymore twitch chat's not my community no they don't count any okay sounds
[101.76 → 108.72] good they're awful people I never want to I never want to be associated with twitch chat love you twitch
[108.72 → 121.92] okay starting us off yeah so I have to confess I was not keeping abreast of this whole drama
[121.92 → 127.84] so it's been it's been summarized for me here by one Nicholas police and I'm going to hope that he's got
[127.84 → 135.60] all the details right but basically Noah Katz CEO of artesian builds who I have to confess I had never
[135.60 → 141.68] heard of before the first thing that I said when I heard all of this was I'm sorry who, and it's like
[141.68 → 149.84] it's not a knock i just there 's's literally a thousand boutique pc builders out there I mean hell
[149.84 → 156.56] I think both you and I probably qualified as boutique pc builders at some point in our lives yep
[156.56 → 164.24] like i i would try to find people who needed builds done and I would go to attic.ca and
[164.24 → 170.96] ncix.com and I would use my premier partner membership to get slightly better pricing and
[170.96 → 175.36] pass my savings on to my pocket while you pay the full price you know like it was that's how
[175.36 → 181.52] contractors work that it's its actually how it works yeah um so i I just can't, I can't keep track of
[181.52 → 186.64] every possible boutique builder out there so it's not it's not a knock against them and I think they
[186.64 → 191.84] if I could make an assumption I believe they mostly sponsored streamers and neither of us really watch
[191.84 → 198.32] streams right so probably part of it that's probably part of it um what is a knock against them is what
[198.32 → 207.92] happened next oh yeah they seem to have some kind of program where they do giveaways of like gaming pcs
[207.92 → 213.84] they stream building them uh apparently they're a pretty significant pc builder streamer the only
[213.84 → 219.04] one that I really know is Logitech yeah and that's only because we collabed with Logitech seems like
[219.04 → 225.20] super swell dude yeah, but apparently they're one of the bigger pc build streamers and on their stream
[225.20 → 234.16] they drew an eligible streamer KIA pay I don't know yeah well whatever this is that sounded cool
[234.16 → 240.96] uh this is the channel okay oh intended for mature audiences well I certainly won't be looking at that
[240.96 → 248.88] I'm not a very mature boy um drew an eligible streamer for a giveaway then refused to give it to
[248.88 → 255.52] her because she was not popular enough she hit which was not part of the criteria she hit every other
[255.52 → 264.56] criteria except uh this was the quote 2 000 followers is under my threshold which was not defined um
[265.76 → 271.92] and then some this is oh okay all followers combined still under 5k across multiple socials I was trying
[271.92 → 278.24] to be generous what trying to be generous here's the reason this person has three months of ambassadorship
[278.24 → 284.00] and not a single click this is an ambassador giveaway said Noah chart CEO of artesian builds which they are
[284.00 → 289.04] to be clear they were an ambassador well not any more they were an ambassador yeah, so my understanding is
[289.04 → 295.36] the requirement is that you have to have a link to them in your bio or like a little banner
[295.36 → 302.88] thing yeah okay and then what were the other requirements you have to honestly I hated the
[302.88 → 307.60] video it was so cringy to watch that I don't fully remember because I haven't re-watched it since like
[307.60 → 312.16] the beginning of the scandal but I think it was just you just had to be an ambassador to be an ambassador
[312.16 → 316.40] uh I know you had to have the thing in the description the banner yeah outside that I'm
[316.40 → 324.40] not really certain I don't think it was very much huh okay sure, so basically the deal was that if is
[324.40 → 332.72] someone clicks through and buys the computer you get a kickback i see okay and basically because
[332.72 → 340.48] there was no click through and no sales they kind of changed the rules on the fly after having drawn
[340.48 → 346.00] someone live and then who had who did have the banner and had the banner as well like they
[346.00 → 349.68] didn't just add it quickly for the stream it was already there it had already been there
[351.84 → 357.04] so here's the thing, and then they roasted them it's its not it's not like they just said no which was
[357.04 → 361.68] already bad because honestly if you wanted to do a giveaway, and you're like okay to be eligible for the
[361.68 → 367.60] giveaway you have to have this many click through or this many subscribers or whatever that's that's
[367.60 → 373.92] its own thing but if is there's none of those terms laid out and then the person doesn't meet your
[373.92 → 380.88] magical in your head requirements, and then you just roast them for it live and then like do this like
[380.88 → 386.80] success fist bump like yes we were able to not give it to this small struggling streamer I don't he
[386.80 → 391.20] obviously didn't say that but like he was very stoked with himself that he was able to deny this
[391.20 → 396.64] person the computer so here's the thing if you're going to have an ambassadorship program if you want to
[396.64 → 402.96] get the benefit of a whole whack load of small streamers going out there and putting your banner
[402.96 → 410.56] under their streams um which cumulatively I have to assume is non-negligible then you're going to have
[410.56 → 415.84] to eat it once in a while and give a prize to someone that might not have an amazing ROI for your
[415.84 → 421.84] business from like a dollars and cents standpoint and at the end of the day you know the attitude is
[421.84 → 430.08] a problem the attitude's obviously a problem but to me, it's just a matter of integrity um i I'm not
[430.08 → 436.16] going to name any names for what I think are pretty obvious reasons but one year at our Christmas party
[436.16 → 448.64] we had a very substantial um perk i will call if it was uh it was a large valuable interesting
[448.64 → 457.04] thing that happened, and we had someone who attended who we knew was probably not going to make it and it
[457.04 → 464.48] was one of those things where we uh we had made the decision, but we were in a position where it wasn't
[464.48 → 470.00] about stringing someone along it was about that it was Christmas, and they'll, you know I just don't
[470.00 → 476.96] have it in me to give someone the boot you know two three weeks before Christmas that in my
[476.96 → 484.24] mind is it is a monstrous is a monstrous thing to do um I mean obviously there's never a good time to
[484.24 → 492.16] to dismiss someone i hate firing people it's its caused problems for me in the past how much I hate
[492.16 → 501.76] firing people, but it's um we decided to do this thing and there was a big debate among senior managers
[501.76 → 513.68] that kind of went um okay so do we give them this thing and the answer was yes because the deal is
[513.68 → 519.68] if you're in the leg family you are in the leg family until such time as you are not in the leg family
[520.32 → 526.48] and then a hilarious thing happened was Luke knows this on a scale of one to ten how would you
[526.48 → 532.72] describe the giveaways at the leg Christmas party oh just I don't want to be cliché but like break the
[532.72 → 539.04] ten like go I've I've never witnessed anything on that scale and i I went to early packs when it was
[539.04 → 544.16] nuts and when my we would literally there would be three of us, and we'd fill my dad's work van with
[544.16 → 550.40] giveaways every year at pax back then that wasn't even close to the Christmas party scale so like
[550.40 → 556.40] yeah we did stuff this year that wouldn't fit in your van yeah it was pretty cool actually had yeah
[556.40 → 559.44] yeah the logistics team was like going around delivering things to people's house
[560.40 → 567.12] had to rent an u-haul anyway yeah the point is that particular individual also walked away with like
[567.12 → 576.64] six or seven grand worth of Christmas party giveaways and the reason I'm telling this story
[577.44 → 585.68] is not because I think I'm some kind of amazing guy for treating people with the basic um of having
[585.68 → 592.24] the basic attitude of if I say I'm going to do something then I need to do if it's that I consider
[592.24 → 600.80] that to be basic and everyone needs to just do that um that's all I have that's all i kind of have
[600.80 → 605.84] to say about that so that whole thing took place a few years ago uh it's its all it's all water
[605.84 → 610.08] completely under the bridge that's why I feel like I can kind of talk about it, I'm not going to name any
[610.08 → 614.24] names nobody I guarantee you people aren't going to be able to guess nobody will be able to guess
[614.24 → 620.80] it uh it's just one of those situations where it doesn't matter if you kind of would have rather that
[620.80 → 628.08] prize went to someone who's going to like maybe still work there in a month um if you said the way it
[628.08 → 636.24] works is if you participate in the games and if you pick the right thing to put your your your name
[636.24 → 641.44] in, and you get drawn then darn it you do it yeah that's it that's all there is to it yeah
[643.92 → 649.28] and I agree with all of that, and then it gets so much worse oh no because he rose to the person
[649.28 → 656.80] and then it goes on the community backlash was really, really intense uh OK parted ways
[656.80 → 664.32] oh sorry who is OK one true king they're like a twitch group is it like a Christian group
[664.32 → 670.16] or something or like no, no no OK network okay I think it stands for one true king okay cool sure
[670.16 → 675.68] it's a twitch streamer group of people cool um shortly after mid chief who I believe is in OK
[675.68 → 684.16] said that apparently the pc that they gave him was absolute garbage bleep poop um yeah poop with an s
[686.64 → 692.08] all right nick mercy a streamer partnered with artesian spoke out and said that he is uh
[692.80 → 698.24] re-evaluating the relationship intel gaming is looking into it testily which is a Markov streamer
[698.24 → 704.16] and video creator cut ties with them uh community outreach in a positive sense has also been really
[704.16 → 710.08] strong Jats two cents is building or this is built so I guess he's already done built her a pc she's
[710.08 → 716.64] already up to almost 20 000 followers now so like bit of a bump I also think that's just on twitch
[717.28 → 722.80] like he mentioned less than 5k for all socials or whatever I think she's above 20 just on twitch
[722.80 → 726.96] and this was probably written a bit ago she might even be higher than now I think it's like 25 000 now i
[726.96 → 737.04] had opened it up before 23 500. Hilarious so that's pretty epic um also artesian's apology video
[737.04 → 745.12] can probably go in the like uh Smithsonian equivalent of terrible apology videos um there's such amazing
[745.12 → 750.88] highlights uh like when he says that future pc giveaways will be able to go to any type of creator
[750.88 → 756.88] regardless of their size he does like a big defeated sigh right before he says that part which is just
[757.68 → 764.24] amazing like super high quality um he has amazing quotes that I'm not going to be able to do because
[764.24 → 769.20] I don't I didn't like just watch the video yeah, but he mentions at some point like we're gonna focus
[769.20 → 775.12] on getting like even better and I'm like dude you need to focus on the better part not even better
[775.12 → 782.64] like you're not you're not in a good situation right now um it's rough Christopher Lee found out that
[782.64 → 787.20] artesian is throttling GPUs to combat thermal issues apparently one creator asked him to take a
[787.20 → 792.72] look at her pc, and he found that Eve's overclocking program had been installed with a 10 throttle applied
[793.28 → 803.60] um what which is just epic a's kind of Sneezy and b completely unnecessary it's a huge
[803.60 → 809.44] throttle and NVIDIA GPU will throttle itself do it on its own what are you doing it's been doing it on its
[809.44 → 817.12] been doing it on its own for like a while now this is not even new um just, just epic just bullet
[817.12 → 822.08] after bullet and then finally apparently we dodged a bullet because as you mentioned we did
[822.08 → 827.52] neither of us have heard of these guys before uh, but apparently they wanted to work with us super
[827.52 → 834.08] bad there are clips on twitch of him like begging his community to reach out uh to get us to work with
[834.08 → 843.20] them etc etc etc, and we just never did it really yeah I mean apparently Noah said on stream that artesian
[843.20 → 849.60] is the pc company Linus would have started if LTT was a pc company oh okay um nope
[849.60 → 852.00] nope
[852.00 → 856.80] um I can't say that I would have throttled a GPU
[857.76 → 866.00] yeah oh that's too bad I mean i oh crap I'm doing the thing I said not to do what right in the title
[866.00 → 870.40] it says not to it says not to hate on your community oh because he's talking about the
[870.40 → 877.44] community artesian is part of my community okay rip um asterisk with some exception how do I get out of
[877.44 → 883.84] this Luke I don't know dude whatever I know I'm I'm I'm everything's a guideline not a rule I was on
[883.84 → 893.12] an I was on a streak no I had one week going with no hot takes no controversy yeah why are you bringing
[893.12 → 899.12] controversy back it's got to happen to Linus tech tips gotta happen oh, oh I see a merch message have
[899.12 → 904.24] people figured out that uh we've got new products available on the store today yeah all right we'll
[904.24 → 909.68] talk about them in more detail later, but we have better and more our cable ties are so much
[909.68 → 915.28] amazing, or now they're like awesome now packaging is sweet to the packaging okay stop stop stop we're
[915.28 → 920.00] gonna talk about it later okay, okay what else uh what else is there to say about this uh there's a
[920.00 → 926.08] comment here uh it doesn't say oh jay's two cents built her a pc yeah I mentioned that yeah oh did you
[926.08 → 933.04] yeah that's sick that was fast too he turned that around quick that's crazy like he's already got a
[933.04 → 939.12] video about its something that I really like she likes local does he like hand it to her or what i
[939.12 → 945.28] haven't watched the video that's a thick machine I'm sure why is this thermal readout sideways come
[945.28 → 950.56] on jay no I'm kidding he thinks he can fix that in software he can fix it with the VGA utility just
[950.56 → 954.00] all you got to do is turn the GPU clock speed down 10 it'll turn right around
[956.88 → 962.48] brutal um something that I've always really liked about being in the like pc hardware community is that
[962.48 → 967.92] yeah the creators in it always seem to have each other's back well heck yeah who else is going
[967.92 → 972.64] to have our backs but like you see a lot a huge range of different other communities on the internet
[972.64 → 977.20] it's not really that way right whether there's manufactured conflicts because they're just trying
[977.20 → 986.32] to like to create fake battles because those get views or there's actual conflicts beef yeah that beef
[986.32 → 991.52] whether it's real or fake seems to be in a lot of other communities that's but the computer
[991.52 → 996.40] hardware community always is actually fairly tight-knit a lot of people in the pc hardware
[996.40 → 1000.16] community are just straight up friends with each other and everyone has their back pretty hard so i
[1000.16 → 1004.72] was I was actually I saw on Twitter that jay said like I'll build you a computer or whatever I thought
[1004.72 → 1013.04] that was super cool and just everyone rushing uh to KIA's defence was uh was awesome it was good
[1013.04 → 1021.76] to see it's good to see it's good to see I love it way to go pc community yeah in other news uh Nintendo
[1021.76 → 1033.84] is removing Nintendo game emulation videos particularly uh on are they're removing videos that feature their
[1033.84 → 1042.88] games being emulated particularly on the steam deck yeah now I actually had a little chat with one of the
[1042.88 → 1048.48] one of the creators that has been affected by this, and we've got a theory that we share but why don't
[1048.48 → 1056.00] we go through Anthony's take here first which is in the wan show doc as steam decks reach consumers hands
[1056.00 → 1064.24] videos of using the steam deck as a switch emulation machine are being taken down by the big n uh for the
[1064.24 → 1071.28] uninitiated you a switch emulator is able to run on the steam deck and pcs and has some pretty desirable
[1071.28 → 1078.88] features such as higher resolution rendering uh game mods higher frame rate support and more it does
[1078.88 → 1087.44] not however support Nintendo's online Nintendo Switch online services Nintendo is famously anti-emulators
[1087.44 → 1096.80] except when it comes to using uh emulation in their own products and uh which was really awkward it was
[1096.80 → 1103.76] the was it the mini ness or the mini SNES didn't they use like emulation code too from somebody else
[1104.40 → 1110.08] if I recall correctly uh yeah the nest classic is based on open source emulation software yeah yeah
[1110.08 → 1116.64] so Nintendo's very against it except when it benefits them let's wait we can sell this let's be very
[1116.64 → 1122.80] clear that they have a line in the sand uh for when it's okay and when it's not yeah um
[1122.80 → 1130.08] um and when it comes to emulating current gen consoles it turns out that they are uh especially
[1130.08 → 1138.80] litigious um now currently the only way to legally dump your own switch games is to have a modded switch
[1139.36 → 1146.72] which is relatively uncommon since Nintendo fixed the recovery mode exploit in 2018 and firmware 8.0.0 patched
[1146.72 → 1152.72] the browser exploit in 2019 I had an OG switch and I actually gave it away at the Christmas party
[1152.72 → 1157.76] because I had treated myself to an ole done and I was like oh that was really stupid I still have
[1159.28 → 1165.76] one yeah I might have access to a second yeah it's fine I'm I'm over it realistically I can afford to
[1165.76 → 1171.12] just buy one one bay if I like need to dump a game or whatever but I'm just very mad at myself yeah yeah
[1171.12 → 1178.00] you can just borrow mine but anyway uh that means most switch emulation is piracy in the legal sense
[1179.76 → 1186.80] that is literally this time literally downloaded from the internet yeah yeah uh the question
[1186.80 → 1193.28] of whether it's that's truly piracy if you own the game is thought to lean towards yes legally uh only
[1193.28 → 1199.60] dumping your own is only dumping your own yeah your own ROMs yeah yeah it's legally protected
[1199.60 → 1206.72] and even that's not settled in Nintendo's eyes which is obviously from an ethical standpoint
[1207.28 → 1215.84] freaking ridiculous if I have a copy of the game sitting right next to me on my desk while I play
[1215.84 → 1222.24] that game not installed not lent to a friend sitting there right in front of me while I play
[1222.24 → 1230.40] that game on my pc because I want save states or I want to play at a higher refresh rate or resolution
[1230.40 → 1238.00] or I want to use a controller that doesn't cost 90 Canadian dollars and is kind of ass right like
[1238.00 → 1245.76] there's a lot of reasons that I might wish to do it that way I personally do not consider that to be
[1245.76 → 1252.24] from an ethical sense wrong Jaden mentioned in flow plane chat uh that there was apparently one
[1252.24 → 1259.20] time when they sold a Mario room downloaded from a room site oh really I vaguely remember something about
[1259.20 → 1267.76] that but yeah oh someone there was like was tasked with like creating a room to sell on some digital
[1267.76 → 1272.48] store, and they're just like yeah I'll skip the work and download it so here's the thing Nintendo
[1272.48 → 1279.68] is within their right to protect their intellectual property from software piracy that is absolutely
[1279.68 → 1290.08] the case however none of what we just said empowers Nintendo legally to take down videos simply for
[1290.08 → 1299.12] showing their gameplay or showing that it is possible to do these things so that's where Nintendo
[1299.12 → 1309.04] utilizing copyright take-downs gets into pretty murky water now this is probably the most interesting
[1309.04 → 1319.84] part of all of this I have a video featuring Nintendo Switch emulation with the you emulator my video is
[1319.84 → 1334.00] still up, but my new friend okay the fox pH a w x not f o x um so not the local radio station no, no not that either
[1334.00 → 1341.12] so um I'm so sorry I don't know how to pronounce your last name dude but carry golem it doesn't matter
[1341.12 → 1348.16] the point is uh carry ended up with a whack of videos taken down and I believe it was one of or
[1348.16 → 1354.40] some of his videos being taken down that ultimately prompted the news story that caught my eye it was
[1354.40 → 1358.88] in my Google News feed uh that made me finally introduce myself to carry because I've been
[1358.88 → 1364.96] aware of him for quite some time but just hadn't really had an occasion to talk to him and uh in
[1364.96 → 1369.44] our back and forth I'm not going to put any words in carry's mouth because I think it's uh it's up to
[1369.44 → 1374.72] him how he wants to address this whole controversy and I don't want to put him in a position where he feels
[1374.72 → 1382.40] like because of what I said he said Nintendo might you know come after him or feel like he would
[1382.40 → 1387.76] whatever right like I don't want to put any words in carry's mouth but I will say what I think and i
[1387.76 → 1395.28] think the reason that this has been this has mostly flown under Nintendo's radar up until now but all of a
[1395.28 → 1404.08] sudden is enough problem that they went and removed not only carry's uh steam deck emulation videos but
[1404.08 → 1411.92] also previous videos showcasing switch emulation was to send a message basically to attack a small
[1411.92 → 1420.16] creator who doesn't have the financial or time a financial means or the time to defend themselves
[1421.76 → 1429.92] as a kind of uh like warning shot because the reality of it is Nintendo did not use the correct
[1429.92 → 1439.92] mechanism to attack carry streaming gameplay footage I don't believe has actually been tested in court
[1440.56 → 1447.52] but my understanding is that it would be it would be pretty defensible from a fair use standpoint
[1447.52 → 1456.16] particularly in the context of reviewing a hardware device and using that software to demonstrate
[1456.16 → 1462.96] and that intellectual property because really it's only the source code would be copyrightable it's the
[1462.96 → 1470.24] trademarks it's it's the imagery that Nintendo feels is being violated when people show
[1470.24 → 1479.28] their gameplay footage um so in the context of using that software to review a hardware device that is
[1479.28 → 1488.08] highly transformative maybe uh arguably affects the market for the original work so that's where some
[1488.08 → 1492.80] game streaming does run into a little bit of trouble I'm trying to remember off the top of my head what
[1492.80 → 1500.88] the other two pillars are pillars of fair use blah blah blah blah blah blah the four factors here we go
[1500.88 → 1505.92] uh purpose and character use the nature of the copyrighted work so it's a game showing a game being
[1505.92 → 1511.04] played on a gaming device I think that's pretty defensible the amount and substantiality of the
[1511.04 → 1517.28] portion taken obviously negligible I mean you're not getting the story you're not getting the gameplay
[1517.28 → 1524.00] experience you're you're not having the fun you're just seeing it running on a screen I think that
[1524.80 → 1532.48] I think that it would be pretty defensible if we actually made it there but Akash Kumar points out in
[1532.48 → 1540.00] the twitch chat that fair use is an argument it's not a legal definition you would actually have to
[1540.00 → 1549.52] litigate it so Nintendo either is kind of going okay we're going to send out a warning to the community
[1549.52 → 1555.28] it's very unlikely we'll actually end up in court over this yep and this is not the correct mechanism
[1555.28 → 1562.16] but we are basically threatening to do something else if you don't get in line and stop showing
[1562.16 → 1571.20] switch emulation so naturally my response to this is that I need to get my hands on a switch that
[1571.20 → 1578.64] allows room dumping and I'm going to make a video I'm going to dump some ROMs and I'm going to run them on the
[1578.64 → 1585.68] switch you ready for the next part all right did I say on the switch I'm going to run them on the steam deck
[1585.68 → 1591.76] yeah I'm going to have the cartridges right next to me showing that i I fully backed them up and I am
[1591.76 → 1598.00] and I'm running them on my steam deck and um I'm going to see what happens I've got my switch has a cool
[1598.00 → 1603.76] clear purple plastic back and should be old enough to roam down all right I can bring that in well that
[1603.76 → 1608.48] sounds pretty interesting to me because the reality of it is I don't think there's any legal foot to
[1608.48 → 1615.68] stand on and I can play my Nintendo games on my steam deck to my heart's content epic using my you
[1615.68 → 1620.48] emulator so I am I'm very excited there's a there's a question right here from Anthony that I think is
[1620.48 → 1626.08] perfect um does the Streisand effect make this much more likely to spread I mean we're talking about
[1626.08 → 1631.12] it on this show or there's probably going to be other people talking about it, I've seen our news articles
[1631.12 → 1637.36] about this already that are not from us um will this literally just make it worse for Nintendo what
[1637.36 → 1645.36] do you think I think absolutely I don't know I mean emulation's not like it's not new I don't think
[1645.36 → 1650.80] people like don't know about well oh I shouldn't say that because there have been some extremely
[1650.80 → 1656.48] ignorant responses to my tweet about this and I'm not like saying like they're you know these people
[1656.48 → 1661.76] are dumb or evil or anything like that they're just extremely ignorant like you'd see people saying
[1661.76 → 1667.84] there is no reason to emulate a game there are lots of reasons to emulate a game I mean we mentioned
[1667.84 → 1672.96] some of them already if you want to play them at a higher resolution or if you want Nintendo games
[1672.96 → 1677.20] that throttle really hard when there are too many things going on screen I mean breath of the wild
[1677.20 → 1686.96] is a launch game, and it like doesn't run great yeah it gets pretty rough like i uh I mean save states
[1686.96 → 1694.08] are a huge one uh speed running in flow plane chat there so I wasn't aware of you uh I am now and i
[1694.08 → 1700.24] will be using it and like in my experience from growing up usually it was generations past that were
[1700.24 → 1706.88] equatable yeah well the fact that the switch is so underpowered like that's fair I mean it's a phone
[1706.88 → 1713.52] from like six years ago like that's what actually runs the thing so it's its not it's not to be clear
[1713.52 → 1719.52] massive respect to the engineering that goes behind creating an emulator for any console
[1719.52 → 1725.12] uh but that particular one we didn't have to wait a long time for the computer hardware to get
[1725.12 → 1736.32] powerful enough to do it yeah um yeah save states save lives it's Conrad 100 so yeah speed running I mean
[1736.32 → 1743.44] that's a community that has absolutely contributed to Nintendo's footprint as a gaming company but they
[1743.44 → 1748.56] just they tend not to see things that way it's in this very black and white sort of
[1749.20 → 1759.92] narrow view and um yeah i i I invite Nintendo to issue a copyright takedown of my video claiming that
[1759.92 → 1766.80] I've infringed upon their footage because I will not have and that'll be that'll be interesting yeah yeah
[1766.80 → 1773.20] I intend to dispute it I think uh in no small part because of these types of things and I genuinely mean it
[1773.20 → 1777.52] quite strongly that in no small part because these types of things Roblox is now worth more than
[1777.52 → 1783.84] Nintendo really yeah well I heard that I haven't I haven't like looked up the information myself but i
[1783.84 → 1790.24] was I was informed that that is the case wow that's crazy Roblox is like birdie's got me for a bunch of
[1790.24 → 1797.36] reasons uh there are videos about that on the YouTube but yeah they're worth like a ton and uh
[1797.36 → 1804.08] Nintendo if they keep going after content creators is they're going to keep having issues I've got
[1804.08 → 1810.32] another really cool example of why emulation is super sick um it's uh it's a great way to be able
[1810.32 → 1817.52] to run like filters on your um like if you like a particular look on the game like if you're playing a
[1817.52 → 1825.76] SNES game on an LCD instead of on a CRT you can add scan lines uh you can add antialiasing for example to
[1825.76 → 1831.68] ps1 games making them actually look better than they did on the original console there's yeah like
[1831.68 → 1837.52] I said it's its just kind of amazing to me like people who think emulation i I there was this
[1837.52 → 1843.44] big argument on I think it was twitter where someone was saying how hard emulation is and I said
[1843.44 → 1848.48] something along the lines of like I'm sure your nephew could do it like it's oh I thought they meant like
[1848.48 → 1856.08] the creation of emulators no like playing running your own emulators it's not it's not hard
[1856.08 → 1862.08] like it's its very it's very in some cases it's like notably easier to be completely honest I don't
[1862.08 → 1871.04] know to be clear like i I don't remember the last time I played a pirated Nintendo game like especially
[1871.04 → 1876.00] a current one like I own a switch I also own a well I don't own that switch anymore I own a switch OLED
[1876.00 → 1882.16] um I actually am I Luke's not going to like this but I buy almost all my stuff through the Nintendo e-shop
[1882.96 → 1887.92] I don't buy physical I don't want to keep track of that I put a big fat micro SD card in that thing
[1887.92 → 1893.20] and I just like download my games I got my kids uh ring fit adventure for Christmas you're like
[1893.20 → 1899.20] very likely just going to lose all those games like but then I guess you can just emulate right yeah so
[1899.20 → 1904.32] there's a valid use for emulation when Nintendo screws you over because of some like shop going
[1904.32 → 1913.60] offline or whatever I will utterly shamelessly emulate those games yeah shamelessly and now that
[1913.60 → 1920.16] you have a steam deck it's like not even that different of a format so that's the big theory
[1920.16 → 1927.36] I wanted to talk about that's why I think Nintendo is issuing a crackdown on this right now because up
[1927.36 → 1935.12] until now emulation of particularly the switch has been a niche use case it's been people who are
[1935.12 → 1940.48] sitting at their computer for the most part nobody has media pcs especially not ones that are powerful
[1940.48 → 1945.36] enough to run you for the most part yeah nobody has handhelds that are actually running this thing
[1945.36 → 1952.40] at least not in any volume like a God win or an AYA neo okay there's there are hundreds of us out there
[1952.40 → 1961.92] right like it's its not the steam deck is going to ship millions of units all of a sudden this is
[1961.92 → 1968.64] and it's in a form factor that is admittedly much larger than the switch and particularly the switch
[1968.64 → 1976.24] light but in a form factor that is now competitive with the switch and so all of a sudden Nintendo's
[1976.24 → 1983.28] going owes to no people are going to figure out this is a thing we better make it go away I changed
[1983.28 → 1988.96] my mind there's definitely some strident effect going on here yeah did you see this is totally off
[1988.96 → 1997.04] topic but did you see gay men was delivering uh steam decks I did see that so I love it I absolutely love
[1997.04 → 2003.44] if it's great i uh I'm still in hashtag no email gang unfortunately uh so I have no idea what I'm going
[2003.44 → 2009.20] to be getting mine, but it'll happen it's fine I would offer to one but I'm using it every day
[2009.20 → 2013.92] how's that going um you know what I haven't actually used a desktop computer since I switched
[2013.92 → 2018.64] to it because I've been like uh it's kind of a hassle i have to like set every i have to plug in my USB
[2018.64 → 2024.24] hub and stuff so I just haven't touched my computer but I've been playing lots of games i I spent
[2024.24 → 2029.20] I've put like 12 hours into horizon zero dawn okay so you've been using the steam deck a lot just not
[2029.20 → 2034.16] as a desktop yeah yeah I haven't actually like used a desktop mode on it yet but no, no I've been
[2034.16 → 2038.24] using it live how's zero dawn running because when it first came to pc it was really problematic
[2038.24 → 2046.48] even on windows it's been okay so I have uh i I definitely have some stuff already to talk about
[2046.48 → 2053.20] in my 30-day steam deck video um for one thing horizon zero dawn ran probably the first like six
[2053.20 → 2058.56] seven hours completely problem free and then I started to get these like really awful stutters as i
[2058.56 → 2062.40] was getting deeper and deeper into the game and I don't know what that has to do with because it's
[2062.40 → 2066.48] not really getting more graphically intensive I would lean on it being harassed and zero dawn's
[2066.48 → 2069.84] problem more than I would lean on it being the steam deck's problem well that's the thing is I don't
[2069.84 → 2079.36] care at the end of the day if you're going to be a console it doesn't matter I bought your hardware
[2079.36 → 2085.12] there are certain standards I bought the game that you said is verified for your hardware oh it's oh it's a
[2085.12 → 2091.92] verified it's a verified title so as a consumer right so you're talking to me Linus the enthusiast
[2091.92 → 2098.88] who understands well proton's hard but as a consumer I don't care that doesn't matter yeah yeah
[2098.88 → 2106.80] I don't even think it's a pro like i I big fan of zero dawn I love the horizon series um when i first
[2106.80 → 2113.84] got it when it came to pc i I got into a situation where I had a repeating game crashing bug I could not
[2113.84 → 2120.08] play the game oh I went up to the next total zero progression bug yeah like right away okay um
[2120.08 → 2126.00] float plane chat says that it's its it's Gouda on pc now better okay cool that's good it's been
[2126.00 → 2130.72] quite a while I'm and they did dedicate to fixing it and there were a lot of patches coming
[2130.72 → 2135.68] out I just haven't retouched it since I trust flow plane chat I'm sure it's fine uh to be clear
[2135.68 → 2141.44] we're talking horizon zero dawn um ducky that not the latest one yeah not, not forbidden yeah uh so anyway
[2141.44 → 2147.44] zero dawn, and then it gets worse so I started to have issues where the right joystick if I put the
[2147.44 → 2152.88] deck to sleep and wake it without completely relaunching the game the right joystick will
[2152.88 → 2158.56] work in the menu but won't work to rotate the camera in game this is just zero dawn or yeah just
[2158.56 → 2162.24] zero dawn so far, but that's what I've spent most of my time playing and these are things that I'm
[2162.24 → 2168.96] noticing more as I'm not benchmarking games as I am playing them like actually putting tens of hours into
[2168.96 → 2175.12] a game yeah um after I started getting those stuttering issues I ran into a complete full system
[2175.12 → 2180.96] hang uh I had the screen just go black and it was gone fortunately I had just saved and then I've
[2180.96 → 2187.44] also had some terrible stutters where for like 10 15 seconds it's running at like one fps and that was
[2187.44 → 2193.28] happening for like a bit and then I did a reboot, and it was fine there's also some kind of hassles um
[2193.28 → 2199.84] um on uh on like a Nintendo console when you update it updates the console and when you update the game
[2199.84 → 2206.48] it updates the game on the steam deck because so much of the software magic that's going on is proton
[2206.48 → 2212.64] when you update the console like half your freaking games update every time as far as I can tell and i
[2212.64 → 2217.28] think that's why but I haven't validated that with valve I'm just I'm just trying to experience it as a
[2217.28 → 2222.00] consumer would and I just feel like every time I turn on the damn thing half my games are running updates
[2222.00 → 2227.28] right and because I threw a one terabyte micro SD in it, I have like a freaking ton of games on it
[2227.28 → 2230.32] just because I wanted to like to have a big game library on my trip and I was like I don't know
[2230.32 → 2234.32] what I'm going to play I'm gonna I'm going to pick up something I ended up picking horizon zero dawn
[2234.32 → 2238.32] I'm sure we could talk about horizon zero dawn a fair bit because honestly I don't think it's very good
[2238.80 → 2247.68] um but uh that's fine okay I shouldn't say it's not very good I should say it's flawed yeah i really
[2247.68 → 2257.60] enjoyed the first 10 hours and what I'm running into now particularly running at like 25 to 30 fps
[2258.48 → 2268.56] on a controller on a little screen is that some of the big dinosaur machine things have extremely
[2268.56 → 2280.48] small weak points oh um yeah and are a real chore to fight and because it has a very light touch
[2280.48 → 2286.56] to its RPG character progression elements where basically you just invest skill points into sort of
[2286.56 → 2293.20] being better into skills like being better at stuff you don't just get like jacked and start just one
[2293.20 → 2302.32] arrowing everything just like getting around is kind of a pain in the butt like the enemies respawn
[2302.32 → 2308.32] so quickly and some of them are so tedious and so resource intensive to fight I don't remember that
[2308.32 → 2313.92] being you can run away from them pretty easily maybe I just did that which is a plus but the other thing
[2313.92 → 2319.44] that really bothers me and this is something I'm sure we could do a full podcast episode on is that
[2319.44 → 2325.60] unlike Zelda breath of the wild with its in my opinion excellent weapon breaking mechanic yeah
[2326.24 → 2334.16] horizon zero dawn has almost no dopamine hit for me when I'm looting yeah oh no that's for sure there's
[2334.16 → 2342.96] like oh yeah no reason to fight i I get like crappy like upgrades for my weapons and my armour of which
[2342.96 → 2350.00] you can only put like at max it seems like three things on it and I'm only you know 20 progression
[2350.00 → 2355.52] through the game and I've already got ones with three slots there doesn't appear to be any meaningful
[2355.52 → 2363.44] difference in defensive benefit other than you know uh elemental defences and stuff like that
[2363.44 → 2368.16] from different gear I don't remember is horizon one of those games where it includes like collectibles
[2368.16 → 2372.56] and stuff and its game progress percentage I don't know because there are a lot of games where you like
[2372.56 → 2379.04] beat it at like 40 percent either way i I'm like not that far in okay I'm pretty sure I'm not that far
[2379.04 → 2386.48] in because I've done a bunch of side stuff as well so um so there's so it's just not that um and the
[2386.48 → 2393.92] crafting materials are just really arbitrary yeah like you just need oh you need one of these to do
[2393.92 → 2400.56] a thing go hunt raccoons and I notably did not like the looting and progression systems i specifically
[2400.56 → 2406.32] remember that extremely extreme, so the cyber pope says breath of the wild had zero meaningful difference
[2406.32 → 2416.48] in gear also that is true, but the difference is that Zelda breath of the wild had the weapon breaking
[2416.48 → 2423.12] mechanic yeah and the weapons got significantly more powerful so you were able to fight more powerful
[2423.12 → 2429.52] foes and there was this inventory management element that as an as a RPG player who actually
[2430.16 → 2437.28] enjoys painstakingly managing my equipment and inventory uh you know like I love Final Fantasy
[2437.28 → 2444.64] tactics for example I enjoy that whereas with horizon zero dawn i I was 10 hours in still using my starting
[2444.64 → 2452.96] bow that's boring I want a new bow that is better and like yeah I got the like accurate like long
[2452.96 → 2460.40] range bow or whatever that takes a thousand years to reload but like give me a rapid shot
[2460.40 → 2466.72] bow or like uh one that makes my knock back way less, or it's like something give me something interesting
[2466.72 → 2470.72] and so it was really yeah it was really it was really boring someone in chat said that you beat the
[2470.72 → 2475.76] story at something like 40 so you're probably like half or slightly over halfway through I've all but
[2475.76 → 2481.60] like I said I've also done a bunch of side stuff so I don't know i I'm just yeah I'm not uh
[2482.72 → 2488.88] and then I reached this point where you have to clear three enemy encampments that is just clear
[2488.88 → 2494.80] gameplay padding just too much yeah you clear one enemy encampment and then there's like this stealth
[2494.80 → 2500.48] segment that's like a pain in the butt and then there's this like bird this like giant freaking bird that
[2500.48 → 2507.20] you're given no briefing whatsoever it has this gigantic area of effect attack and I'm just sitting
[2507.20 → 2512.32] here going I finally shoot the thing down and I get some like weapon enhancement coil that's not even
[2512.32 → 2517.20] better than what I already have I'm like when you only that's one of my big criticisms of the earlier
[2517.20 → 2522.80] Zelda games is there's like nothing to get you get all these rupees and there's nothing to buy you don't
[2522.80 → 2528.48] care, but that's why breath of the wild was so interesting to me because the in-game economy had a meaning
[2528.48 → 2535.68] there was a purpose to it, you actually wanted to sell stuff you wanted to like to turn your raw
[2535.68 → 2540.96] materials into things that you could sell for more so that you could get that that like better armour
[2540.96 → 2545.12] that you needed and get the like that that weapon that you're going to need to take down that thing
[2545.12 → 2551.04] so you could steal its weapons so that you could farm those things and a looting system that uh breath
[2551.04 → 2555.44] of the wild reminded me of that I've been kind of chasing forever and breath of the wild is the first
[2555.44 → 2561.68] thing that's given me kind of taste of it is actually original ever quest because an original
[2561.68 → 2566.88] ever quest way back in the day when I was like 10 uh if you were running around, and you're like
[2566.88 → 2573.44] four pixels of awesome um if you saw a skeleton or whatever enemy, and he had like a sword and a belt
[2574.08 → 2579.84] that was what he had you would get a sword and a belt right it was so cool because you could, you'd
[2579.84 → 2583.44] run it you'd be running by, and you see a bunch of normal skeletons, and you'd see one with a sword
[2583.44 → 2588.40] and you'd be like oh dang he's actually stronger than the other ones can I beat him if I can beat
[2588.40 → 2592.32] him then I get those things and like I don't know it was just it was very cool it was very satisfying
[2592.32 → 2599.76] um do you want to know something interesting I say I'm a fan of the horizon game I haven't played
[2600.40 → 2604.24] forbidden west or whatever it's called I've only played the previous one and I also haven't beat it
[2605.12 → 2610.56] oh so wait I really enjoyed the amount of the game that I played which one did you play just that
[2610.56 → 2615.76] one which one horizon zero dawn oh zero dawn oh really i just never beat it oh I really enjoyed
[2615.76 → 2620.08] the amount that I played and then I had to give the PlayStation back to work i just never oh I see
[2620.08 → 2624.08] I was like I'll play it later and then i never really played it later than it came out on pc
[2624.08 → 2628.96] and then it was just crashing and I was like I'll play it later I still haven't so I probably played
[2628.96 → 2635.60] it is more than you at 20 in probably yeah okay because I played the first like I got out of the first
[2635.60 → 2643.60] area and then I did like a little bit after that, but it wasn't like a ton I found the beginning very
[2643.60 → 2648.08] fun but I have probably not gotten to the parts that you've got I had a lot of fun in the beginning
[2648.08 → 2653.60] too but one of the things that uh is bothering me is that in the very, very beginning you fall into this
[2653.60 → 2660.16] cave and there's these like uh voice recordings that are like holy crap I'm in this dystopian future
[2660.16 → 2665.44] and like was this like a weird cult or something I am now 12 hours in and I haven't revisited that
[2665.44 → 2671.92] oh okay I assumed the storyline went back there um well I'm sure it does oh okay at some point
[2671.92 → 2677.60] yeah just not like assassin's creed does that a lot too assassin's creed will be like you're in the
[2677.60 → 2682.80] you're in like the current year timeline you do like a few things, and then you go into
[2682.80 → 2687.52] some ancient timeline you'd never really come back until like the very end of the game
[2687.52 → 2691.76] for one very short mission that doesn't make a lot of sense, and then it's just over its like what
[2691.76 → 2696.96] it is the more recent games have kind of given up on that a little bit more but apparently forbidden west
[2696.96 → 2702.48] fixes a lot of those things oh yeah that's another one I've seen so many complaints that uh the melee
[2702.48 → 2710.00] combat in zero and uh, uh zero dawn is terrible and here's a terrible thing about it apparently you never
[2710.00 → 2716.56] change your weapon you just start with a spear, and then you can just put like boosters on it and that's it
[2716.56 → 2722.88] you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll, you can use any weapon you want as long as it's the spear you started with
[2722.88 → 2729.36] like okay i really yeah I found the progression to be a little not great I remember that um i really
[2729.36 → 2736.24] liked the world building and the like environments and the and the story that was presented to me at the
[2736.24 → 2742.64] time and beautiful oh yeah absolutely gorgeous at 720p this big but it's beautiful yeah and that's
[2742.64 → 2748.88] the thing is in breath of the wild okay horizon zero dawn you get like these maybe a 30 boost to
[2748.88 → 2753.36] your damage or whatever with one of these things but if you don't hit the enemy in exactly the right
[2753.36 → 2761.12] spot it's 30 boost on three damage yeah is four damage like it's not helpful if you're hitting them
[2761.12 → 2766.80] in the armour whereas in breath of the wild once you get late game weapons you can just walk and if a
[2766.80 → 2770.64] goblin or however you pronounce that Bamako I don't even know it doesn't matter the point is if they
[2770.64 → 2776.16] walk up to you just like done them, and it does barely even any you know endurance damage to your
[2776.16 → 2781.92] weapon, and you can dispatch them and move along like you can move uh i I don't I don't like
[2781.92 → 2788.72] just um not being able to move around freely through areas that I have already cleared and I get that the
[2788.72 → 2796.32] hunting element is a big part of the game like being a becoming a skilled hunter or whatever but i
[2796.32 → 2800.72] don't want to have to be a skilled hunter to just there are ways they could get around that because
[2800.72 → 2805.84] they could like um I don't know that we're getting into like game development stuff but there
[2805.84 → 2813.04] could be like a natural fear because you're you're a predator right so like the lower level
[2813.68 → 2817.68] robot animal things could start to fear you and just run away naturally so you can travel yeah they
[2817.68 → 2824.16] do that in um whatchamacallit that really, really bland RPG that I just played on switch uh briefly
[2824.16 → 2829.28] default 2. yeah they like once you've defeated a certain amount or whatever they just start fleeing
[2829.28 → 2836.48] and then what's great is you can uh you can like sheepdog like kind of herd them into a corner this was
[2836.48 → 2842.72] this was one of my favourite things to do uh was I would uh I would like to take an area where they're all
[2842.72 → 2848.80] kind of wandering around on the overworld and then I would like to get them all into this like one corner
[2848.80 → 2855.68] and then i would throw back one of the like attractor things, and then you chain fights in that
[2855.68 → 2860.88] game if they're all within range of you okay so you would do i I would do I think my record was like
[2860.88 → 2866.96] eight or nine or something like that was it did I break 10 I can't remember so I did so many fights in
[2866.96 → 2872.64] a row and there's this multiplier I think it maxes out at 3x don't quote me on this but I was
[2873.28 → 2878.96] it's a game that is designed to be broken so that was the part that the story was utterly just
[2878.96 → 2883.44] disposable it was bland completely bland um characters had like kind of a little bit of
[2883.44 → 2888.64] personality but overall just not that well done it's one of those games where it's like you, you what
[2888.64 → 2896.96] you think throughout the game is like completely like oh blah blah big plot twist whatever um but what
[2896.96 → 2902.40] I enjoyed was the tinkering like that kind of playing around and like maxing out my jobs on my characters
[2902.40 → 2908.56] and stuff like that and I forget where I was going with this but basically they yes they could have
[2908.56 → 2916.72] an um a mechanic like that, but it doesn't need to be there or I don't know wow we got really far away
[2916.72 → 2923.28] from uh removing Nintendo Switch emulation videos um, but we did it what time is it should we do

[3061.20 → 3068.40] NVIDIA oh oh oh I think we should talk about these how interesting these are new to me, I didn't even know
[3068.40 → 3072.16] this was something we were working on have a look at them, they're cool yeah open it up open it up there's
[3072.16 → 3080.08] lots of different ones that's right ladies and gentlemen our cable ties are now better than ever in
[3080.08 → 3087.28] actually a lot of ways, so there's way more of them in a pack at exactly the same pricing we have a
[3087.28 → 3095.20] whack ton of colours now check this out we've got over 10 different colours, and they now come in
[3095.20 → 3102.80] environmentally friendly packaging legitimately cool they're like little paper bags yep so you can get
[3102.80 → 3110.88] your Ltd cable ties today at ltdstore.com lots of different colours here we can get an example of
[3110.88 → 3117.76] one that is not just the standard black or gray base colour you can have a red one oh yeah sorry I'll uh
[3117.76 → 3124.24] here here here I'll base colour purple check that out hey there we go how fun is that right uh the colours
[3124.24 → 3130.64] were picked by Sarah and then I think I basically was like yep looks good to me because she's always she's
[3130.64 → 3135.84] always so good at that kind of stuff like i just kind of trust her and intrinsically at this
[3135.84 → 3141.60] point just yeah sure Sarah yep it's probably good sounds good you know what I mean it's just one of
[3141.60 → 3146.08] those things right that's actually why I was late for Sancho today I was doing Sarah's intel extreme
[3146.08 → 3154.96] tech upgrade so get excite guys because I set her up with a streaming setup so apparently she's like
[3154.96 → 3160.88] maybe gonna start streaming I guess that's cool yeah right for she going to stream I don't know I mean
[3160.88 → 3165.92] she did that one stream on flow plane where it's they uh where she showed designing the privateer shirt
[3165.92 → 3170.80] yeah yeah so maybe she'll do some design stuff maybe i I mean we put a decent GPU in her rig so maybe
[3170.80 → 3178.88] some gaming stuff nice yeah I'm excited oh people are like I want a mixed colour pack rainbow pack um oh
[3178.88 → 3184.72] that's a pretty good idea we're not there yet, but it could, you should just try to have a bundle
[3185.84 → 3194.56] yeah I guess we could um and yes the colour on the packaging does match the colour of what's inside
[3195.36 → 3200.96] so like the black one with the purple has a purple little thing on the tab here we are trying we're
[3200.96 → 3208.80] not done yet, but we're trying to move to completely recyclable or recycled packaging one
[3208.88 → 3216.96] or the other um I think our goal is by 2023 everything should be plastic and like foam and
[3216.96 → 3222.96] just, just nasty stuff like that free that's the goal I'm not promising we're going to hit that goal
[3223.92 → 3230.32] our CEO doesn't get fired um if we miss that goal, but it's something that I have set for the team
[3230.88 → 3238.08] that we i we all are just completely aligned on wanting to move towards it how many per bag uh 50 50 per bag
[3238.88 → 3245.04] um I couldn't even really tell by holding them but yeah they all say 50 packs on them that's a lot
[3245.76 → 3254.00] yeah nice all right the tech industry responds en masse to Russia's invasion should we go through this
[3254.88 → 3260.08] yeah on Monday Twitter added labels to tweets by Russian state media and has paused ads and
[3260.08 → 3267.60] recommendations features in Russia and Ukraine Microsoft is helping Ukraine defend against cyberattacks
[3267.60 → 3274.40] um they've they've removed RT Sputnik etc from the Windows store and their start platform I don't
[3274.40 → 3280.88] even know what that is uh, and today they suspended sales of hardware and software in Russia also today
[3280.88 → 3287.52] both intel and AMD announced they have halted all chip sales in Russia and Belarus YouTube followed meta
[3287.52 → 3293.04] in pausing monetization for Russian affiliated media channels last week videos from block channels will
[3293.04 → 3298.48] appear less often in recommendations and following a request from Ukraine RT and other channels are no
[3298.48 → 3304.24] longer accessible in the country apple halted sales pulled Russian state media apps from the app store
[3304.24 → 3310.32] and disabled traffic reports on Apple Maps in Ukraine to deter tracking there many game publishers
[3310.32 → 3316.08] including Ea CD project red and others have halted sales in Russia and Belarus there are many more
[3316.08 → 3322.40] examples it appears that any company still conducting business as usual with Russia is now the exception not the
[3322.40 → 3330.80] norm we are no longer working with any Russia or Belarus based entities, and we are not shipping LTT store
[3330.80 → 3339.36] products to Russia or Belarus that was set up earlier this week it's not huge, but you know for our part
[3339.36 → 3347.28] we're just kind of looking at it going well um it seems like the correct thing to do so there you have
[3347.28 → 3353.28] it something that I feel like a lot of people are getting confused about here is that just because
[3353.28 → 3360.08] we're condemning what's going on right now this totally unprovoked invasion of Ukraine doesn't mean
[3360.08 → 3364.40] that there aren't other horrible things happening in the world and that we do approve of those things
[3364.40 → 3368.00] just to be very clear and that there hasn't been other horrible things that have happened in the past
[3368.80 → 3375.04] uh any we approve of those either any violence towards civilians you know what honestly I'll take it further
[3375.04 → 3383.76] uh any violence is you know harming another human being i I don't think there's a major religion on
[3383.76 → 3389.76] earth that's like yeah you should definitely harm other human beings like i I'm pretty sure like as
[3389.76 → 3398.72] a species we've all kind of agreed for a long time that it's not cool but um you know hey people in power
[3398.72 → 3407.44] they do it anyway uh and that sucks its kind of where I'm at on that yeah yeah it's been it's been
[3407.44 → 3415.92] rough um the Russian ruble fell 30 percent in value on Monday apparently uh hasn't fallen further because
[3415.92 → 3421.44] MOX the Moscow stock exchange has been closed all week this is an Anthony young note notably on Monday
[3421.44 → 3427.28] a Ukrainian official sent a letter to can requesting they block Russian domains today they responded that they
[3427.28 → 3431.68] won't be able to as they have no sanction levying authority saying essentially can has been built
[3431.68 → 3436.00] to ensure that the internet works not for its coordination role to be used to stop it from working
[3438.00 → 3443.20] yep Russia blocked access to Facebook in the country Russia is blocking many western media
[3443.84 → 3452.08] western media based outlets uh so BBC reporting um to using shortwave radio just like in World War ii
[3452.08 → 3458.96] that's hilarious uh Elon apparently sent Starlink stuff to Ukraine which I thought was not necessarily
[3458.96 → 3469.44] uh a huge you know starry-eyed fan of Mr musk, but that's a cool move good move in a decent amount
[3469.44 → 3474.88] of places in Ukraine right now that's the only form of communications that are reliably working uh he's
[3474.88 → 3481.04] also made it so that you can use it on like moving vehicles and stuff which I do not believe was possible
[3481.04 → 3488.80] before cool so that's pretty sweet uh there's also been this feud going on between Elon and Roscosmos
[3488.80 → 3495.04] um the Russian space agency oh uh there's been a few different things there was a threat more or less
[3495.04 → 3502.00] from the Russian space agency saying like hey we could drop the is sum because Russia's generally they
[3502.00 → 3506.96] they have oh I'm going to say something wrong here I'm sorry but as far as my understanding goes they are in
[3506.96 → 3516.16] control of thrust basically keeping it up there um, and he was like if is is we're no longer able to do
[3516.16 → 3520.80] this because of various reasons like sanctions and all this kind of stuff who's going to it'll just drop
[3520.80 → 3524.32] out of the sky it might drop in Europe it might drop in the US it doesn't fly over Russia it's not
[3524.32 → 3530.72] a problem to us um and apparently Elon just responded with a SpaceX logo, and apparently they've already
[3530.72 → 3535.44] figured out how to just like click in dragon modules there's going to have to be some like adapters made and
[3535.44 → 3541.04] stuff, but they can do it um and then there was another thing saying like oh well you're like
[3541.92 → 3545.44] you're you're not going to be able to get people into space anymore like Russia has always gotten people
[3545.44 → 3551.12] into space and that's that's true generally people have flown on Russian rockets yeah um and then Elon
[3551.12 → 3559.12] again was like we'll do it um so I think this has been quite beneficial for SpaceX to be completely honest
[3559.12 → 3564.40] true Scott says Linus the vast majority of Russians do not appear to be in support of the war
[3564.40 → 3572.64] even a large number in the Russian army so don't hate on Russians hate on that bleeped word Putin fair
[3572.64 → 3580.24] enough yeah I mean i i I have never said I don't hate on Russians yeah Russians the people
[3581.92 → 3591.60] no problem yeah the individuals be they Russian or not who are launching missiles at civilians well they're
[3591.60 → 3600.40] monsters um, but unfortunately we're not in a position to do anything uh the only way that anyone
[3600.40 → 3607.44] else can put pressure on the Russian government is to put pressure on Russia the country and unfortunately
[3607.44 → 3614.64] the Russian citizens are caught in the crossfire here so at the end of the day the only people who can
[3614.64 → 3622.24] do anything about the regime that is leading their country are the people who live there I can't yeah
[3623.92 → 3626.32] so that's where we're at yeah
[3629.04 → 3635.84] yep it's uh you don't you don't hold the people accountable for the leaders actions you know
[3635.84 → 3645.20] anyway in other news uh NVIDIA hacked DSS source code leaked maybe switch to question mark yeah this
[3645.20 → 3652.08] is pretty rough they've now confirmed that they were hacked uh la la p SUS dollar sign lapsus I don't know
[3652.08 → 3659.20] uh is claiming responsibility apparently they made off with one terabyte of data demanding NVIDIA releases
[3659.20 → 3666.88] their drivers as open source and distribute under a Foss license um they also want mining limiters turned
[3666.88 → 3674.16] off of course uh if they don't they've threatened to leak chipset files graphics can I just say I called it
[3675.04 → 3682.16] do you remember do you remember when I was like hey the mining limiter when there's this many billions
[3682.16 → 3689.20] with a b when there's this many billions of dollars at play there it's a matter of time until someone
[3689.20 → 3696.16] gets bribed, or something nothing can keep that mining limiter in place yeah I think this wasn't the
[3696.16 → 3702.16] exact way that we expected it to happen nope it sure is we also don't know exactly how they know
[3702.16 → 3708.96] they were hacked the mechanism could have been social engineering we don't know that yeah anyway carry on
[3708.96 → 3712.72] yeah they also want the mining limiter turned off if they don't they've been threatened to leak chipset
[3712.72 → 3718.96] files graphics and silicon info uh for existing and upcoming GPUs they've already leaked some names
[3718.96 → 3725.92] Ada hopper were well known but Blackwell is new tech power up was uh handed a list of files claiming
[3725.92 → 3732.08] to be the DSS source code uh apparently it looks credible enough includes a programming guide document
[3732.08 → 3738.48] that makes sense of the code data miners found references to nvn2 and no in the source code
[3738.48 → 3744.72] nvn2 is thought to be the switch graphics API no is the switch code name it also includes references
[3744.72 → 3752.88] to t234 and t239 chips which are ampere based SOCS and some of the data goes back as far as 2019 which
[3752.88 → 3758.72] is when the switch pro rumours started wow um also yeah it has now been added to the dock because this
[3758.72 → 3763.44] happened I believe very recently so I'm I'm actually I'm happy that it's in the dock I'm kind of
[3763.44 → 3768.80] surprised it's good um it's good it's in the dock it's not good that it happened because doxing this
[3768.80 → 3774.56] is the same thing as as we were just talking about how you shouldn't be hating on the Russians
[3774.56 → 3781.60] right like this is the same thing uh NVIDIA hackers apparently leaked the credentials for 71 355
[3781.60 → 3786.72] employees that's not what to do no it's not
[3790.56 → 3796.64] what credentials I'm not 100 email addresses I mean if they're just NVIDIA email addresses those
[3796.64 → 3801.44] are easy enough to get it was my understanding before the show that it was like personal information
[3801.44 → 3807.36] if it is just email addresses that's still I mean it's annoying uh but I thought it was like actual
[3807.36 → 3812.72] personal information NVIDIA also only has like more like in the neighbourhood of 20 000 employees
[3812.72 → 3822.24] according to the tom's hardware article about this so interesting I haven't I mean I haven't seen
[3822.24 → 3832.40] the information myself so I don't know what exactly it is um the hacking group is also asking for a
[3832.40 → 3838.96] million dollars for access to NVIDIA's light hash rate cryptocurrency mining limiter uh so I guess
[3838.96 → 3845.84] we'll see if anyone pays that I suspect it's a matter of time before someone does what's going to happen
[3845.84 → 3851.28] if NVIDIA caves we might see more cyberattacks if they don't how useful could the chipset files and
[3851.28 → 3857.76] other information be to competing brands oh very useful like the source code for DSS if I'm NVIDIA I'm
[3857.76 → 3862.80] absolutely quaking in my boots they do have a hardware component that makes it more difficult to
[3862.80 → 3870.64] compete with but my belief is that access to the source code for DSS would give engineers at
[3870.64 → 3877.12] competitors like AMD or intel or even like a Qualcomm for example would give them a lot of hints as to
[3877.12 → 3884.48] what they need to do in their hardware to utilize this software I was going to say like even if you don't
[3884.48 → 3890.32] use like say you don't copy and paste any part of it uh the ability for that source code to expand your
[3890.32 → 3898.48] knowledge base is enormous oh yeah yeah utterly enormous, so this is intense this is this
[3898.48 → 3903.12] is one of this is maybe bigger than the twitch leak I was going to say this is one of the biggest hits I've
[3903.12 → 3911.84] like ever seen like this is actually crazy um and a terabyte might not sound like that much if
[3911.84 → 3920.56] we're talking about you know video Blu-ray rips a terabyte of code that is a lot of code uh is that
[3921.20 → 3925.20] uh I don't we don't know that it's all code no we don't know that it's all code but if it is
[3925.76 → 3929.52] that's a there's a lot of code it's an enormous there's like no way that's not a lot of code
[3929.52 → 3934.64] but there's clearly a lot of it in there um yeah and i and I don't think it's like all videos
[3934.64 → 3943.36] so it's got to be just a monstrous amount of data this is absolutely crazy um lapsus you got
[3943.36 → 3953.60] to be got to be terrified of them boys um them people epic games buys band camp is this news
[3954.64 → 3962.00] it's its weird like why it's really weird I think that's basically everyone's response to it was like
[3962.00 → 3972.16] huh what yeah I don't know um I thought band camp was owned by apple oh that's a different band camp
[3972.16 → 3980.16] oh that's like band camp the software for making music yeah there's like other more different band camp
[3980.16 → 3988.80] yeah independent music platform yeah okay so you didn't even know what band camp was actually
[3988.80 → 3994.16] literally more weird twitch chat is half oh no garage band never mind garage band is
[3994.16 → 4000.16] the software half of twitch is like what's band camp and the other half is like oh I love band camp
[4002.96 → 4010.88] what even is this indie music platform okay I had yeah I had no clue band camp is famous
[4011.76 → 4017.60] uh for being one of the best platforms for independent music that provides artists with an average 82
[4017.60 → 4023.76] percent revenue share that's pretty cool whoa the rest is split between band camp and payment
[4023.76 → 4030.96] processors that uh doesn't fit with the split that epic games takes yeah that could be interesting
[4031.76 → 4037.76] unlike many other platforms band camp takes 15 by default but actually drops their cut once an artist
[4037.76 → 4043.28] makes over five thousand dollars annually this is to enable artists to make the transition from hobbyist
[4043.28 → 4047.92] to professional that's pretty cool during the pandemic band camp introduced a program called
[4047.92 → 4053.68] band camp Fridays where the company waived its revenue share for all sales on the platform to
[4053.68 → 4060.40] artists who were unable to tour I haven't heard of these guys, but they sound freaking cool yeah this is
[4060.40 → 4066.24] awesome I love it um but why in the press release epic states that they have a vision to build out a
[4066.24 → 4072.48] creator marketplace ecosystem for content technology games art and music and more uh could epic want band camp for
[4072.48 → 4079.28] their back end and web storefronts uh maybe to help improve the awful epic game store that's fair
[4079.84 → 4086.88] uh or could this be related to unreal engines ever-growing presence in Hollywood perhaps epic has much
[4086.88 → 4092.40] larger media aspiration dude epic does so much stuff like epic worked on I don't remember the name of the
[4092.40 → 4099.44] system but I was watching a video on it recently where um there are architects like legitimately using VR as part of
[4099.44 → 4104.48] their workflow now yeah you know how like in a lot of different spaces VR has been used in these like
[4104.48 → 4110.16] uh demos yeah yeah, but it wasn't like it was mostly to like kind of show off to clients yeah this is
[4110.16 → 4117.84] like legitimate use of VR in an architecture space because they're using uh unreal oh I see, and they're
[4117.84 → 4123.28] like actually they're they're they built some system where they can import their I don't know what it is
[4123.28 → 4128.24] cat or whatever of these buildings or these giant spaces, and they're making it so you can walk
[4128.24 → 4132.48] through them right because a big problem that they had with the cad designs on a computer is when you
[4132.48 → 4138.40] try to like to enter the building it doesn't really feel like you're doing it yeah so the experience of
[4138.40 → 4144.80] the architecture was hard to mentally absorb right yep um it makes a lot of sense, and you add like new
[4144.80 → 4150.48] unreal features to it and actually looks perfect, and it's like okay that's pretty cool uh so yeah i
[4150.48 → 4155.84] don't know epic like they do a lot of stuff they don't just do games so maybe it makes sense
[4155.84 → 4163.04] yeah I had never heard of band camp before apparently it's pretty darn cool so sweet
[4164.16 → 4171.60] Rivian bumps their prices up by 20 people get mad Rivian says never mind I saw snazzy was yeah snazzy was
[4171.60 → 4173.68] all over this super mad
[4178.48 → 4184.72] to be clear I mean yeah I'd be mad if you say the price is you know whatever and not that long ago
[4184.72 → 4189.68] and you go on a big media tour, and you say the price is that, and you have everybody saying what
[4189.68 → 4196.16] a great deal your truck is, and then you jack up the price by 20 percent because uh a deposit for a
[4196.16 → 4206.48] reservation is not a down payment it's just a reservation um yeah it it it's a little uh, uh
[4206.48 → 4214.24] uh disingenuous I guess would be the best word for that this is yet another reminder of why you
[4214.24 → 4220.32] shouldn't pre-order did do people have reservations for cyber truck right doesn't it
[4220.32 → 4227.44] nick I think so I think he does that's a thing right I think so was f-150 lightning even announced
[4227.44 → 4233.76] when that reservation went in I don't think so it's like out now it's yeah yeah you can buy
[4233.76 → 4238.16] assuming you can find one in stock theoretically you can buy one it's a bit of a problem
[4239.28 → 4246.40] Doug de Euro called it out in his review um the truck is way too cheap oh that's interesting okay
[4248.00 → 4252.56] what else we got here, so this wasn't just new orders the price hike included all current reservation
[4252.56 → 4258.80] holders yep news came alongside announcement of a dual motor all-wheel drive variant of the r1s SUV
[4258.80 → 4265.36] and r1t pickup trucks um Rivian basically blamed it on inflationary pressures increasing component
[4265.36 → 4272.24] costs unprecedented supply chain shortages and delays which is fair enough customers were peeved began
[4272.24 → 4276.16] cancelling their pre-orders in droves, and they rolled back the price hike on pre-orders as of march
[4276.16 → 4280.16] 1st and are offering customers who cancelled their pre-orders the ability to reinstate them
[4280.16 → 4286.88] so that's good there's a discussion question saying will Rivian be able to build back uh consumer
[4286.88 → 4294.08] trust after trying to pull this charade yeah uh probably they said never mind yeah and if the
[4294.08 → 4302.40] product is ultimately great then I feel like I mean okay I shouldn't say this because I don't really
[4302.40 → 4307.28] understand truck buyers very well like I'm not it's its a hard mindset for me to put myself in as
[4307.28 → 4313.60] someone who doesn't own a truck and will never own a truck i I just don't really get it so maybe
[4313.60 → 4319.60] you guys just need to tell us will Rivian get your trust back like as someone who doesn't have a
[4319.60 → 4326.32] pre-order in I'm not that mad if I had a period I'd have been pretty made the reason why I think i the
[4326.32 → 4331.76] reason why I said that I believe it'll be okay is because the sentiment that I've seen online so far
[4331.76 → 4338.64] is kind of like uh oh okay like people were furious, and then they said oh never mind you're fine
[4338.64 → 4342.00] and if you cancel the order you can reinstate it, and you'll still be fine we'll honour your previous
[4342.00 → 4346.72] price everything's okay and then the whole inner when it kind of went all right on to the next thing
[4347.28 → 4352.72] like the amount of care doesn't seem to be super strong anymore so I think they kind of clawed that
[4352.72 → 4357.76] back probably fine so yeah i I wasn't mad because I don't have one but I also don't have one because i just
[4357.76 → 4363.04] like you're not going to pre-order I'm not yeah I'm not gonna I don't put down deposits for vehicles
[4363.04 → 4367.28] that don't exist, yet that's not going to be a thing that sounds like a pretty good way to go
[4367.92 → 4372.72] well I mean the flip side of it is that if I'm like a snazzy or something like that I saw a tweet
[4372.72 → 4377.84] from him like a while back saying that I think it was his model three like paid for itself in the
[4377.84 → 4382.32] videos he did about it or like almost did or something like that yeah so I could see why he might you
[4382.32 → 4387.68] know put in an order and be mad if it's going to cost 20 grand more than he expected that's of course
[4388.16 → 4392.88] gosh darn it that's another video he's going to have I don't I don't know if he's making 20 grand on a
[4392.88 → 4397.92] single video probably not but i I don't know like car content it would help if you joined float plane
[4397.92 → 4407.60] finally yeah maybe car content apparently drives like massive um CPMs for some people we haven't
[4407.60 → 4413.60] seen it so I don't really get it but I've heard from other car creators that car videos are just like
[4413.60 → 4418.56] stones CPMs I feel like you'd have to do it more often maybe yeah maybe I don't know maybe
[4418.56 → 4425.52] we're just too like pigeonholed into the tech niche yeah the newest crypto is
[4425.52 → 4434.40] review that's funny um do you have anything else do we do merch matches merch yeah we should we
[4434.40 → 4440.32] should do them now is your last chance to get in a merch message um if it doesn't come in like real
[4440.32 → 4445.12] soon we're not going to do it uh nick says looking forward to reading the ABCs of gaming with my
[4445.12 → 4453.28] daughter what are your thoughts on Sam on Rx series AMD GPUs I just got it running and I'm unsure if it
[4453.28 → 4464.64] helps with my fps does it depend on the game s an m uh this is a thing I'm not familiar with the old
[4464.64 → 4472.32] one moment please s an oh smart access memory that's right uh it makes a small difference
[4473.28 → 4476.24] there you go and yes it is uh heavily game dependent
[4479.04 → 4482.96] archive Josiah what do you think of the as rock server motherboards that
[4483.60 → 4489.76] uh take consumer grade CPUs I think it can make a ton of sense as long as you don't need features
[4489.76 → 4497.28] that are specific to server grade CPUs like say for example support for much greater amounts of
[4497.28 → 4503.12] memory and that's whatnot it's like a huge differentiator right yeah Michael will you be
[4503.12 → 4509.76] testing the steam deck with an external USB hub that supports both power delivery and holds a NVMe i
[4509.76 → 4516.72] haven't yet I have tested it with hubs that have you know USB and Ethernet and power in, and it works
[4516.72 → 4524.72] with those but I haven't tested it with one like that that does sound pretty cool cheaper 2280 NVMe
[4524.72 → 4530.72] still able to plug in and 3d print a holder so it would clip onto the deck seems like a cheaper option
[4530.72 → 4534.72] to add more storage with power delivery yeah that's uh that's a pretty cool use case why don't you make
[4534.72 → 4542.40] a video about it huh I'll shout it out on Sancho hey Dawson if you did a budget build a thousand
[4542.40 → 4547.20] us dollars is the budget rig right now would you recommend the same things you did on your most
[4547.20 → 4552.64] recent budget build or would you make any changes okay so GPU prices seem to be falling a little bit
[4552.64 → 4562.00] yeah arc theoretically should be showing up imminently I would say hold on a second i know i normally
[4562.00 → 4568.16] I say buy what you can afford at the time when you have the budget and enjoy it and don't look
[4568.16 → 4573.76] back don't look forward just you know focus on the now and enjoy yourself, but that is not the case today
[4573.76 → 4582.32] today I am going to say I would wait a little bit I would hold off particularly on a GPU nick how many
[4582.32 → 4586.72] cable ties do I need to buy to get a water-cooled steam deck video I mean it's honestly I think
[4586.72 → 4591.04] someone smaller and more agile than us is going to end up doing it first we've got so much stuff in
[4591.04 → 4596.08] the queue right now I just don't see how we're going to be first to market on that one anonymous
[4596.64 → 4602.72] Linus or Luke what are your thoughts on Pokémon or slash did you grow up with it, I'll let you handle this
[4602.72 → 4609.84] one we both did didn't we um I mean I played like Pokémon blue I didn't watch the show did you play
[4609.84 → 4616.96] did you do anything with cards nope what are your thoughts on Pokémon as a parent uh I think that as
[4616.96 → 4621.84] long as my kids don't waste too much money on if it's fine they like sorting their little cards and
[4621.84 → 4627.68] trading them with their friends I have only taken the Pokémon cards away from them twice and both times
[4627.68 → 4633.36] it was because they were once they were fighting about them and another time uh one of the cousins
[4633.36 → 4640.00] was over and made an unfavourable trade evidently and was really upset about it and I was like look
[4641.44 → 4647.20] if it's a game where not everyone is having fun is it a good game no okay Pokémon cards away I don't
[4647.20 → 4651.36] want to see them for the rest of the weekend so that was that's about it that's my that's my
[4651.36 → 4655.60] parent stance yeah on Pokémon cards as long as I don't fight about them, I don't give two hoots i
[4655.60 → 4660.48] liked a lot I'm honestly I'm going to put a hot take out there I'm very disappointed with modern
[4660.48 → 4667.36] Pokémon games like deeply disappointed and I deeply think they should like deeply be ashamed um like
[4667.36 → 4672.88] genuinely I think it's I think they have done nothing with one of the best IPS that has ever been made
[4673.44 → 4679.68] um the games have really not evolved much further than they have been in the past people have made
[4679.68 → 4686.48] third party games that are knock offs of the Pokémon IP in some cases just straight up doing it knowing
[4686.48 → 4691.44] that they're like pirating the IP that have been hugely successful and then crushed because they're
[4691.44 → 4696.08] stealing the IP obviously, but it was hugely successful and the whole fan base that was playing
[4696.08 → 4703.28] it was like yes finally a Pokémon game that isn't red and blue version 82 this is great and then they
[4703.28 → 4709.52] just close it down, and they make red and blue version 83, and it's really lame do something with
[4709.52 → 4716.16] your darn IP Arceus or whatever it's called I haven't even played it I've heard from a lot of people that
[4716.16 → 4721.76] it is a fantastic game if you've never played open world games before and if you've ever played an open
[4721.76 → 4727.28] world game before it's terrible and I'm not surprised it also looks like it's 10 years old what are you doing
[4727.28 → 4736.32] right stop make something cool I don't know that's fair like think about the amount of money that
[4736.32 → 4743.92] Pokémon Go has made yeah has the feature set really evolved as much as it should have I like it
[4745.60 → 4752.80] no it hasn't okay stop it anyway or better yet don't stop it yeah Bryson what are your thoughts on
[4752.80 → 4757.84] bungee threatening to ban destiny 2 players okay yeah sorry, sorry one second legends Arceus is
[4757.84 → 4762.48] actually a huge change to the classic formula yes you're right finally that should have happened
[4762.48 → 4769.20] like a decade ago don't kid yourself also it's not enough sorry let's keep going I saw a tweet earlier
[4769.20 → 4777.04] that we should do a LTT store oven mitt for our hot takes I think that's a great idea that'd be great so
[4777.04 → 4782.16] thoughts on bungee threatening to ban destiny 2 players for trying to play the game on steam deck
[4782.80 → 4796.40] so it is ironic to me for a game developer and the key word is developer to be so closed-minded to
[4796.40 → 4804.72] have what almost feels like a kind of irrational Norrie fear of Linux and Linux users that's my
[4804.72 → 4809.68] perception of this I haven't dived into it enough is it just like an anti-cheat thing i yeah it's an anti-cheat
[4809.68 → 4816.64] thing so I feel like there's this perception that if we try to support Linux it will open the door to
[4816.64 → 4823.68] more cheating is sort of my guess and on the one hand that is sort of fair enough every platform
[4823.68 → 4828.72] that you have to support with your anti-cheat is another bunch of mitigations that you now have to
[4828.72 → 4839.60] deal with but I also feel like um there's just kind of an unwillingness to tackle this that this is
[4839.60 → 4847.52] stemming from as opposed to an actual rational analysis of the reality yeah that we're
[4847.52 → 4853.44] living in uh i I think it's a not good look for a company that just got acquired in like this battle
[4853.44 → 4861.12] that's going on between Sony and Microsoft um toxic mantis says they will ban users who try to
[4861.12 → 4866.96] bypass anti-cheat anyone on steam deck will get put back in their game library, so guys maybe get us
[4866.96 → 4871.44] a little bit of maybe get us a little bit of clarification on that one in the chat sorry guys
[4871.44 → 4875.68] we don't have a ton of detail on this because it's just like a merch message that someone sent so
[4875.68 → 4879.60] two things from flow plane chat one person said Pokémon goes money mostly goes to antic not the
[4879.60 → 4884.16] Pokémon company yeah then they I think they haven't done enough with it, I don't care who's behind it
[4884.16 → 4889.68] um and the Pokémon company has plenty of money yes they literally print it yeah if you could have okay
[4889.68 → 4894.80] if you could have a machine that prints dollar bills or if you could have a machine that prints Pokémon
[4894.80 → 4901.60] cards which would you take oh the Pokémon obviously yeah like it's worth more than a dollar bill
[4901.60 → 4907.92] it's actually a money printing machine there's also another person that said lapsus uh has another data
[4907.92 → 4914.48] leak from Samsung apparently 190 gigabytes including uh stuff to unlock the bootloaders' oh wow
[4915.92 → 4927.12] spicy that group is going nuts this is going to go down in history wow oh wow apparently bungee's
[4927.12 → 4931.92] anti-cheat and filters ban people for using utilities and like hardware monitoring software and stuff
[4931.92 → 4943.92] oh wow that's pretty stupid okay uh Michael b steam deck looks sick I put in my reservation for one do you think the steam deck will get support for Windows 10 and 11 yes it will
[4946.40 → 4959.92] uh anonymous I love all the products you guys develop I know you get a lot of questions about upcoming merch that people want to see my question is are there any products you have already looked into in the past but can 100 confirm you will never offer in the store
[4959.92 → 4967.92] huh a product we will never offer um
[4969.36 → 4973.76] no why would you commit to something like that yeah i I don't think there's anything that we've confirmed
[4973.76 → 4979.04] we will, I mean there's stuff we will probably never offer I don't think we have industrial fishing boats yeah
[4979.04 → 4985.52] I don't think we can contribute a lot to the fashion jewellery industry I don't know if I'd say that
[4985.52 → 4990.88] uh that might happen yeah I don't know yeah hard to say I mean we don't want to yeah we don't want to
[4990.88 → 4993.68] close the door on anything we want to we want to keep exploring new ideas
[4997.84 → 5004.24] so someone in chat has challenged dildo confirmed thanks twitch chat never change uh yeah
[5004.24 → 5008.88] someone in chat has challenged me on my Pokémon Go innovation thing I have a really easy example
[5008.88 → 5014.32] just literally off the top of my head uh they're they've based all the nodes in Pokémon Go off of
[5014.32 → 5024.08] uh wow is antic the name of the company what is the name of the original game that they made that i
[5024.08 → 5030.40] played a billion years ago I'm trying to find why can I not remember that ingress oh right uh all the
[5030.40 → 5035.12] nodes are based off ingress this was like I remember when Pokémon Go first came out I did like
[5035.12 → 5040.40] no research on it, I saw it on my phone I went for a hike because I was like I want to find like Geodude
[5040.40 → 5044.64] because Geodude's one of my favourite Pokémon so I'm going to go for a hike I found like three Pokémon on
[5044.64 → 5049.12] the entire hike and then figured out that you're supposed to go to like McDonald's because that's
[5049.12 → 5054.72] where the freaking things are I'm like this doesn't make any sense for the Pokémon universe for on launch
[5055.28 → 5060.24] sure that kind of makes sense the fact that it's still based on ingress nodes at this point
[5060.40 → 5066.64] or at least uh most of them are I haven't been keeping up with it is crazy how is it not based
[5066.64 → 5072.32] on trails and parks and like all the stuff that Pokémon is supposed to be freaking based on if you
[5072.32 → 5081.20] play the games this whole time it makes no sense, and it sucks and that is so solvable dude they made
[5081.20 → 5087.12] so much money you should be mad if you're a fan you should be mad I play Pokémon Go with my family
[5087.12 → 5092.64] we play like every summer like kind of quit in the winters then when it's like good weather to go
[5092.64 → 5098.80] walk around we all play together and I like it for that it's cool it's also nowhere near where it should be
[5099.36 → 5105.76] that's fair okay that's fair sorry um glad you're enjoying your expensive edition pillows Seville
[5105.76 → 5110.88] and Uber fuzzy says he did never say children's clothing because regulations no I said not
[5110.88 → 5116.48] children's clothing now because we're not insured for it that's where I'm at on that uh Mr mine heads
[5116.48 → 5122.24] says condoms question mark uh it is very unlikely that we would do anything that has that kind of
[5122.24 → 5127.12] liability yeah there's got to be intense liability with that or maybe there isn't I mean if you just
[5127.12 → 5134.16] say like hey it's not 100 then well I guess you're the guess you're the unlucky one got him
[5135.68 → 5140.64] every 100th one has a hole poked through it kyle says if colour accuracy of monitors drift over time
[5140.64 → 5148.40] do camera sensors too can you colour calibrate a camera sensor yes and yes if for in general it's not
[5148.40 → 5153.44] really necessary but for scientific use absolutely you would need to you would need to calibrate any kind
[5153.44 → 5159.60] of sensor ace a Linus I've been wanting to ask you about your raccoon story since in an earlier stream
[5159.60 → 5166.32] pre-teen show with the one true Jake what is it being your story with raccoons oh crap what is my
[5166.32 → 5176.56] raccoon story I don't remember your raccoon story I'm sorry I don't remember I do remember saying I was
[5176.56 → 5180.88] going to tell a raccoon story but I don't remember the context of what we were talking about yeah I don't
[5180.88 → 5186.80] know and I don't remember the story I don't like I can't even give you any context clues because i
[5186.80 → 5190.24] don't remember either I don't remember what it had to do with at all
[5193.20 → 5201.28] huh all right oh I'm sorry guys Ryan says hey Linus and Luke what's to
[5201.28 → 5209.68] what to what would be the feature you're each most excited about for the upcoming LTT backup
[5211.28 → 5220.48] I'm assuming means backpack oh backpack um most excited about I don't know the
[5220.48 → 5227.20] backup is you sure are you sure I don't know
[5229.36 → 5234.48] well I like if we stick with backup what does that mean I don't know I'm not sure if that's
[5234.48 → 5240.40] why I just well we're we're working on that data restoration thing from the vault what feature are
[5240.40 → 5245.44] you most excited about oh yeah I don't know that's why that's that's all I had we only you haven't uh
[5245.44 → 5250.00] responded to that email by the way I know okay I know I'm way behind on my emails okay
[5251.52 → 5256.72] uh I like that the size is right can fit a ton of stuff in it, but it's like perfectly fits under
[5256.72 → 5262.40] an airline seat which I benchmarked on my last uh flight yeah it's great that I think would
[5262.40 → 5269.52] probably it still fits a ton of stuff but isn't as ginormous as my current bag would probably be a
[5269.52 → 5275.12] big benefit for it as well because I yeah like if I go on a plane with my current, but there's no way it
[5275.12 → 5279.04] doesn't even remotely fit under the seat it has to go in overhead compartment with everyone else's
[5279.04 → 5286.80] like full luggage right yeah so I don't know uh oh someone asked something that I thought was a
[5286.80 → 5291.28] good question how's the vault going uh vault restoration is actually going really well Wendell's
[5291.28 → 5300.72] helping so you know that that's like op uh Garrett says I love the neon design how do you think
[5300.72 → 5306.56] steam deck will affect the desktop Linux market share in general oh a lot I think a lot of gamers
[5306.56 → 5313.60] are going to run steam OS like 100 I think basically every other gaming distro see you later buddy
[5314.40 → 5320.48] are you going to do any content on running it on a standard desktop instead of a steam deck uh I think
[5320.48 → 5324.56] that what I'm actually more tempted to do is run it on something like an Roneo
[5324.56 → 5331.04] like I want to run it on competing handhelds because even though the current Roneo is not
[5331.76 → 5338.24] uh is not competitive with the steam deck in terms of price to performance I think that smaller
[5338.24 → 5344.00] companies like a God or like AYA like a one x player I think that those guys are probably going to
[5344.00 → 5352.80] iterate faster and like pcs to consoles a console like a steam deck might come out and be the king for
[5352.80 → 5359.92] price to performance and pcs might start to make up ground while a console has this longer development
[5359.92 → 5366.32] cycle so I'd be really interested to see what it's like to run steam deck software on one of these other
[5366.32 → 5371.20] consoles and the fact that valve is being so open about everything is so cool I mean I shouldn't say
[5371.20 → 5376.56] it's that cool like they profit from it either way, but it's cool that unlike the other companies that
[5376.56 → 5381.60] profit from you buying games either way they're being sensible about it that's cool
[5383.28 → 5390.00] I'm reading in fill paint chat that potentially Wendell is running steam oz that's cool Wendell runs
[5390.00 → 5400.40] like everything but that's cool I think that's the kind of thing that Wendell would do but um I don't
[5400.40 → 5405.68] think it's like ready to freaking rock for just your average user, yet that's my understanding of its
[5405.68 → 5410.72] current status I'm still waiting to hear back from right Wendell's also like OS agnostic so he's
[5410.72 → 5416.08] probably just checking out because he's interested yeah it's team OS Xbox how cool would that be
[5416.08 → 5420.16] Chris says hey guys been watching since the Langley house days keep up the excellent work I just picked
[5420.16 → 5425.20] up a pair of bone conduction headphones and I've been enjoying them just curious what your opinions are
[5426.24 → 5432.72] everyone that I've tried doesn't sound good enough for me to be willing to accept the trade-off I think
[5432.72 → 5441.52] Conrad runs them really um Conrad if you're in Chatham I think you do uh h Christophe I'm talking
[5441.52 → 5443.04] about Wendell from level one TeX
[5443.04 → 5451.92] uh Gregory find gift cards for the future backpack release okay all right is there a spot for an air
[5451.92 → 5457.36] tag and maybe a Lamb pink interior colour in the future I don't think we have an air tag spot but
[5457.36 → 5467.20] we probably should air tag spot for backpack the second part of his question is also Luke have you
[5467.20 → 5472.80] ever considered allowing musicians to use flow plane as an online ticketed concert streaming service
[5473.44 → 5482.56] um they could uh right now we have uh we have garbage time on the platform uh who it's extremely
[5482.56 → 5487.92] entertaining i mostly unfortunately have to watch his gods because I can't always watch his streams
[5487.92 → 5492.56] because they happened like right in the middle of my work day and I usually can't do that but um
[5493.36 → 5500.16] there it's fantastic and his whole channel is like exclusively music so yeah why not Jacob i
[5500.16 → 5505.36] believe Alex is planning to cover the KIA ev6 uh don't quote me on that but I'm pretty sure he is
[5505.92 → 5511.84] Christopher I've been a fan since OG kitchen love you guys question do you ever think certain
[5511.84 → 5516.88] components will be fast enough will there be a time when the focus will be on size and power only
[5516.88 → 5521.44] not raw performance being the leading stat for consumer gear I mean I think that happened already
[5521.44 → 5528.80] look at phones definitely has right like that was that shift from computing needing to be about go
[5528.80 → 5534.88] faster faster faster to okay this is good enough laptops tablets phones actually went
[5534.88 → 5539.84] laptops phones tablets but whatever that's not the point yeah I think it already happened because you're
[5539.84 → 5548.48] you have to consider various use cases right so the like internet browser music player email or word
[5548.48 → 5555.68] editing use case that a lot of people have uh picture editing very basic video editing that kind of
[5555.68 → 5560.00] stuff is coverable by relatively low-end hardware at this point yeah and a lot of people are only doing
[5560.00 → 5567.76] that once you end once you uh bring high-end stuff into it whether it's like high-end video editing or
[5568.32 → 5576.08] or gaming or whatever else that's where your top end kind of blows up uh and gadget says that if
[5576.08 → 5583.04] you try to run destiny 2 on the steam deck you could get banned um but ban those players who try to
[5583.04 → 5589.12] circumvent the restriction okay so maybe you have to actually try to circumvent the restriction I'm
[5589.12 → 5595.04] not sure if it seems pretty brutal to just outright ban anyone that tries to launch it, but then it's also
[5595.04 → 5598.24] might be hard for them to tell the difference between someone who's just trying to launch it on
[5598.24 → 5602.80] it doesn't seem that hard to tell the child I don't know I don't know enough about anti-cheat to
[5602.80 → 5607.92] to speak authoritatively so I'm just gonna not talk about it uh pirate or ninja
[5607.92 → 5616.00] uh ask all age I'm going to go ninja all right thanks for the order Andrew says hi Linus uh
[5616.00 → 5621.12] thanks for the great merch hey no problem do you think shelling out 200 plus is worth it for a
[5621.12 → 5626.08] thunderbolt 4 dock well if you need a thunderbolt dock that's pretty much what they cost I run dual
[5626.08 → 5631.04] external monitors with my XPS 15 and I'm plugging two USB dongles and a c charger is a pain have a great
[5631.04 → 5637.68] show so I mean yeah it just comes down to how much is that one cable solution worth to you, it's
[5637.68 → 5643.44] certainly convenient thunderbolt's amazing but I think a lot of people would say yeah two cables is
[5643.44 → 5650.64] fine and a dongle uh Jeff says got my first Ltd underwear last week they ain't cheap but dang they're
[5650.64 → 5657.84] good question when Windows 11 oh you got two more packs nice we see so we see that so often one pack
[5658.72 → 5662.96] two more packs because that's the right amount for a full week and then a little bit of a buffer yeah
[5662.96 → 5668.88] yeah yeah uh when Windows 11 came out I heard it was not good for gaming needed optimization bug
[5668.88 → 5674.64] fixing whatever um how has that evolved uh my understanding is it's in pretty reasonable shape
[5674.64 → 5679.60] now, but it's still early in the Windows 11 life cycle and there's nothing wrong with sticking with
[5679.60 → 5686.48] Windows 10 for the time being I have a little bit of interesting Windows 11 news yeah um mr Sam I got
[5686.48 → 5693.20] your message people have gotten around the requirement to log into an account thing really
[5693.76 → 5699.84] uh I don't think I should say how because I had a super annoying experience today I installed windows
[5699.84 → 5706.24] 11 on Sarah's machine let me tell you not only did it require me to log into an account but before we
[5706.24 → 5711.68] were connected to the internet and Wi-Fi drivers weren't included with windows conveniently so I had to go
[5711.68 → 5718.56] get a switch I said I called this out on there was no way to I called this out I was so mad yeah
[5719.52 → 5725.92] windows is terrible with that so it's just going to be a problem yeah so um I don't think I want to call
[5725.92 → 5732.32] it out because I don't want them to fix it oh I see but I'll, they're just going to fix it anyway okay I don't
[5732.32 → 5738.32] know the exact uh mechanism for doing it, but there's a thing where you go in purposefully with no internet
[5738.32 → 5744.64] and then you do a command line thing oh like tell the computer like to force it to think something's
[5744.64 → 5750.24] going on, and then you can get through oh it's so annoying yeah Jacob says Luke what are some tech
[5750.24 → 5755.44] companies that you would consider developing for if you were not at leg I just got my CS degree in
[5755.44 → 5761.36] December and looking for interesting new places to apply keep up the good work bought an expensive
[5761.36 → 5770.72] edition pillow dang celebrating the new job before you got it enjoy the pillow I have no idea um
[5771.44 → 5776.88] come on you can be a little more imaginative than that I have suggested to people that are Canadians
[5776.88 → 5783.04] to apply at Shopify um I know two different people that work there, and they have personally
[5783.04 → 5790.16] told me that they have had very good experiences so I don't know but yeah I mean I haven't looked
[5792.32 → 5797.44] in a long time so I don't know uh my aspirations when I was growing up was to be a part of a game
[5797.44 → 5804.96] development studio um that sounds awful these days yeah and the one that I wanted to join has been
[5805.68 → 5812.16] really terrible so I don't know dude i and I know that's like an annoying answer but I'm not sure I'd
[5812.16 → 5818.24] I would knowing better understanding my personality as I'd grown up as I've grown up I would probably try
[5818.24 → 5827.84] to find some small team that was making something new and like really different yeah yeah and there's
[5827.84 → 5831.84] a lot of that, and you can genuinely find those things there are tons of startups out there so i
[5831.84 → 5838.48] would probably do that type of stuff i actually man I really love the more doing things the old way
[5838.48 → 5844.32] projects these days and I think that's just because I'm like getting old there's a game that I saw that I'm
[5844.32 → 5852.88] really excited about um I haven't researched it nearly enough so you know maybe my excitement is
[5852.88 → 5858.80] totally unjustified um but here I'll bring it up and I'll show it to you oh it's called sea of stars
[5858.80 → 5864.32] and it looks amazing someone in chat said hello I'm glad you didn't work for blizzard that's funny i
[5864.32 → 5869.44] was actually talking about uh another bee company oh I thought you were talking about blizzard oh right
[5869.44 → 5877.76] right right right Elder Scrolls fanboy yeah until it went oh what yeah um stars you said yeah
[5877.76 → 5886.00] the art style just looks so beautiful and like it looks amazing oh I do like the art it's a retro
[5886.00 → 5892.72] inspired turn-based RPG very krone trigger inspired I'd jump on this in a heartbeat yeah it looks awesome it
[5892.72 → 5900.48] do I really enjoyed cross code which is another sort of similar thing where it's uh modern gaming
[5901.12 → 5907.76] advancements applied to a more retro aesthetic really enjoyed it oh i really once I scrolled
[5907.76 → 5913.12] down I saw the playable characters I really like that art that's fantastic yeah so I'm super excited for
[5913.12 → 5919.20] that is this like out or no, no it's still in development right now okay yeah, yeah so I'll uh I've got it in
[5919.20 → 5928.96] my in my stuff I want to do Trello spot yeah I don't know I'm very business apparently Liz says uh
[5928.96 → 5934.16] hopefully getting my steam deck next week what's the best game you've played on the deck so far well
[5934.16 → 5938.48] that's the great thing about the deck is that the games are as good as the games are the deck doesn't
[5940.40 → 5945.04] determine what games you can, I mean it do you know from a compatibility standpoint but any game that
[5945.04 → 5949.68] will run on the deck should theoretically be a pretty darn good experience on the deck if I could
[5950.56 → 5956.16] add something potentially what is the best experience deck wise you've had so far because you mentioned
[5956.16 → 5962.00] there were problems with horizon zero dawn I'm still really enjoying it okay yeah uh that's the game I've
[5962.00 → 5970.88] put the most hours into on the deck for sure yeah yeah I'd say I'm I'm I'm really enjoying it I mean the
[5970.88 → 5976.80] fact that it runs it all is such a just computing miracle to me that I'm sort of forgive the crashes
[5976.80 → 5982.48] so I'm an atypical consumer in that sense sure yeah uh Christopher says my wife would like to know
[5982.48 → 5987.28] why there isn't any branding or design on the women's clothing since that's what she would like to purchase
[5988.00 → 5996.96] I had a fascinating um debate conversation I don't know what to call it with the ladies in the
[5996.96 → 6001.52] creator warehouse team when we had our merch meeting this week when I was pretty surprised by that too
[6001.52 → 6008.00] I'm sorry my girlfriend was pretty surprised by that too okay so what I said was i was also
[6008.00 → 6019.28] surprised because I did not know about our first few women's uh apparel projects until they literally
[6019.28 → 6028.00] landed in our office oh I was not aware of them at all, and it was not my expectation that they would
[6028.00 → 6034.80] be the things that they were I did not know that they were in development and the problem here is that
[6034.80 → 6043.76] as not a woman I'm not um really you know I don't want to mansplain what women want right but as someone
[6043.76 → 6053.44] who has had my fingers on the pulse of this community for 13 years I feel like I know what our audience is
[6053.44 → 6062.08] asking for I know what my woman is asking for and what Yvonne wants is what I have but fits her yeah and
[6063.52 → 6073.44] that was what I was expecting and I feel like what we did instead was all equally valid we tried to
[6074.08 → 6085.36] make a like good as heck the thing that is um like trendy right now and and and popular, and so I feel like
[6085.36 → 6095.36] those are two very valid um approaches and I feel like and this is kind of what I said during the meeting
[6095.36 → 6105.20] is I feel like we um we might have subverted the expectations of many of our viewers, and we might
[6105.20 → 6111.12] have made something for a customer that we haven't that we haven't really figured out a business model
[6111.12 → 6118.24] to address yet because in my mind that's the customer buying just high quality like trendy merch from us
[6118.24 → 6126.40] for a female like doing that um is a different customer from who we might want to address first
[6126.40 → 6131.92] which would be uh viewers of LTT who have been looking at the mail merch for so long going yeah
[6131.92 → 6137.52] I'd really just like one of those but i was expecting and so's yeah I was expecting like couples
[6137.52 → 6145.36] photos level stuff you know it's the same thing, but it fits us both properly um and to be clear when i
[6145.36 → 6150.32] said my girlfriend was wondering about that too she wasn't like why isn't it there I wish it was there
[6150.32 → 6156.80] yeah I was just surprised yeah um and Yvonne was the same way and uh one in particular that Yvonne's
[6156.80 → 6164.88] really jazzed about is that um that 3d printed like uh liner jacket that I've been wearing the early
[6164.88 → 6171.68] samples of for the last like few months she's like I want one of those and um the design that i the
[6171.68 → 6178.56] initial design that I got from the merge team was like a women's style jacket and I told Yvonne that
[6178.56 → 6184.80] and she was like oh because she just wants the one that I have but like fitted, and so I think there's
[6184.80 → 6190.96] two sort of very different sort of camps here and I feel like what we need to do is we need to figure out
[6192.16 → 6197.20] what we're because at the end of the day we're going to have to address both, but we need to figure out
[6197.20 → 6204.40] our order of operations here and um it's hard because you also don't want like 10 billion skews and
[6205.36 → 6210.16] things get difficult yeah and like we had this interesting debate around
[6210.80 → 6218.72] what is a standard sweat pant right um, so my understanding was well it would be not low rise
[6218.72 → 6222.96] and not high waist it would be like the middle, and they're like well it doesn't really work that way
[6222.96 → 6229.60] because particularly in women's fashion it is like this will be the standard and
[6229.60 → 6232.96] then this one is the standard and then this one is the standard, and it's like cyclical like that
[6233.52 → 6237.92] yeah and then my response to that well it was like well yeah but is it sort of self-perpetual
[6237.92 → 6243.44] is it an is it a perpetual motion machine does everyone buy this and then everyone makes only this
[6243.44 → 6247.92] and then that's the only thing you can buy because that's one of the things that um Yvonne talks about a
[6247.92 → 6252.56] lot is how difficult it is for her to buy clothing because her tastes are her tastes
[6252.56 → 6256.80] and she doesn't care what does trendy do you remember empire waist like tops
[6259.44 → 6263.92] they look like maternity clothes I remember empire I don't remember them saying basically they were like
[6263.92 → 6268.64] they had like a bust here, and then they were tight around here and then flowy I remember the yeah yeah
[6268.64 → 6274.24] so for a period of like four years Yvonne couldn't buy a shirt that fit her, and it was just stupid right I did
[6274.24 → 6280.24] not like those i I was like one of my least favourite periods and yeah anyway yeah anyway the
[6280.24 → 6285.20] point the point is that uh you know what I was trying to say was well maybe there's maybe there's
[6285.20 → 6292.40] another way of maybe we could just make the standard one, and then it's like well hold on a second you
[6292.40 → 6297.44] can't use the word standard I'm like that's totally fair yeah who decides who the standard one is yeah am
[6297.44 → 6302.24] I mansplaining women's fashion right like so I'm just kind of sitting here going I don't know what the
[6302.24 → 6307.52] answer is actually I do know what the answer is the answer is as the only other person in this
[6307.52 → 6313.52] building who actually signs checks I think Yvonne is going to work with the merge team and talk to
[6313.52 → 6318.72] them about the women's stuff because what I think she brings to the table is that understanding of our
[6318.72 → 6324.56] community and yeah no it totally makes sense even if she's not the be all and end all of our customers
[6324.56 → 6329.28] I think she understands our community and she at least buys women's clothing whereas I don't
[6329.28 → 6338.88] like that's another thing too is I feel like we have to kind of speak to um the uh the 98 of
[6338.88 → 6345.12] you who are supposedly male according to YouTube's internal stats that they provide us who might be
[6345.12 → 6350.32] buying something for and so and choosing something to you know do like a couple's matching thing or
[6350.32 → 6357.12] whatever the case may be so that's kind of where I'm at um danger panic says excuse me but Yvonne
[6357.12 → 6363.92] absolutely is the be all and end all thank you very much not really I mean we do need to address
[6363.92 → 6370.96] her, but she's sort of got an unusual figure and is you know a millennial like me not exactly you know
[6370.96 → 6376.00] a young kid anymore with the trendiest taste right like Yvonne and i both understand that we're not the
[6376.00 → 6382.16] be all and end all a lot of the time when I give feedback it's really around fit it's around quality
[6382.16 → 6388.40] it's around comfort i a lot of the time I'll say look I like that colour but ultimately I leave
[6388.40 → 6394.48] this to you guys right like i you got to let experts be experts yeah and so that's where i just how what
[6394.48 → 6400.00] am I how am I supposed to comment on the fit of a women's garment what do I know I might have wide
[6400.00 → 6408.96] childbearing hips but I certainly don't have breasts right so it's tough yeah all right uh I can say she
[6408.96 → 6414.40] she has an unusual figure on broadcast I mean i I think that you have never heard those two roast
[6414.40 → 6419.84] each other before i I have watch the I don't even mean it as a roast I think she's got especially for
[6419.84 → 6426.16] mother of three she's rocking so like that's pretty unusual I'm just saying like if is that fazed you uh
[6426.16 → 6433.68] go watch the roast yeah no kidding I think it's pretty unusual to be 35 with three kids and looking
[6433.68 → 6439.28] like that I'll say that much all right and I think that's pretty much it for the LAN show today we will
[6439.28 → 6452.72] see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
