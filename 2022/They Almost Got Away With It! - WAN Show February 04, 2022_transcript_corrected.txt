[0.00 → 8.52] What is up ladies and gentlemen welcome to the WAN show we've got a fantastic show for you guys lined up today
[8.52 → 16.08] Gamers Nexus has been making big news this week calling out New egg's scummy return policies
[16.08 → 25.44] so we're going to be definitely weighing in on that in other news Sony acquires Bungee for 3.6 billion
[25.44 → 40.08] Facebook loses 252 billion well yeah and valuation magic money and
[40.08 → 47.64] yeah you stole my other topic, so I'm looking for another one oh yeah I think you mean I privateered
[47.64 → 55.88] topic you pirated my topic also New York Times uh purchased Wordle because everyone has to buy
[55.88 → 64.70] every game every company has to buy a game we should buy a game um okay PewDiePie here's my offer
[64.70 → 72.18] okay YouTuber simulator we want it dude I'm offering you two ABCs of gaming plushes from
[72.18 → 80.94] lttstore.com and this lock of my hair okay if you accept the offer if you accept the offer PewDiePie
[80.94 → 87.66] right now live on stream I will go get scissors I will chop off this lock of hair okay and I will
[87.66 → 92.28] mail it to you, I want YouTuber simulator this is how business let's roll that intro
[102.18 → 120.96] the show is brought to you today by grid studio graphics and Squarespace all right let's jump right
[120.96 → 129.24] into our first topic this has been quite the saga according to gamers nexus New egg has been running what
[129.24 → 138.96] amounts to a scam yeah so what exactly is it, and I am expecting to be able to contribute at least a
[138.96 → 144.18] little bit of my experience actually having worked on the retail side of things but let's go on and
[144.18 → 151.04] let's kind of let's kind of walk through what happened here according to uh gamers nexus the
[151.04 → 158.88] problem is that customers are being denied refunds for ineligible products specifically motherboards
[158.88 → 165.92] the problem with this is that the motherboards are often new in box Jake just showed up Jake what
[165.92 → 175.36] can I do for you, I can yeah I think I can show it sure I'm pretty sure it's fine I'm pretty sure I'm
[175.36 → 186.48] allowed to show wait are we allowed to show it not on uh I think so right okay yeah yeah yeah okay
[186.48 → 193.80] I think so do not turn it on I won't turn it on I won't turn it on have you held it yet no okay we're
[193.80 → 198.00] gonna talk about you're not allowed to talk about it, we're going to talk I know I can talk about whatever
[198.00 → 204.96] he wants he doesn't know anything I know nothing oh yeah you can't talk about the feel or anything
[204.96 → 212.52] all we're allowed to tease no expression all we're allowed to tease is that we've got one
[212.52 → 216.28] so don't react to it in any way
[216.28 → 229.24] laughing is not a unique reaction for me everyone knows this oh I'm so excited not being able to say
[229.24 → 235.96] anything feels so like functionally wrong I know I know I know the problem though is
[235.96 → 241.12] that this is a final unit so while I have actually commented on things like ergonomics, and we've even
[241.12 → 247.60] pointed a thermal camera at it when we did our early hands-on sneak peek that was on pre-production
[247.60 → 252.76] hardware this is the actual one that will be delivered to actual consumers have you placed a
[252.76 → 258.28] pre-order yet yeah, yeah okay all right remember I told you were like not stoked, but I did it
[258.28 → 263.86] during WAN show right yes I want to get early in like you right yeah that's uh that that's fair
[263.86 → 269.62] that's fair I would love to ask you if you have any regrets, but I can't because you can't, I have things
[269.62 → 275.42] to say, but I can't, I have things to say he says all right well uh there will definitely there will
[275.42 → 281.62] definitely be opportunities to say things I've got a lot of content planned for the steam deck
[281.62 → 289.32] when uh are you allowed to say when you can say things no I that I'll usually when the NDA is
[289.32 → 297.04] expired is covered by the NDA right um one of the things that I am planning to do, and I'm actually
[297.04 → 303.58] really excited about this one is I am going to switch to the steam deck as my only computer for a
[303.58 → 310.66] month whoa why not I mean you literally just did the Linux challenge, so I think you can answer that
[310.66 → 318.12] question why not because of the problems, but it's the steam deck theoretically and this
[318.12 → 323.42] is something I haven't tested I haven't I haven't touched yet because people in the chat are telling
[323.42 → 332.36] me to run no I mean I would do it yeah so like why not it's a quad-core zen 2 processor
[332.36 → 339.04] right rdna2 graphics these are all things that are publicly known it's got up to a 512 gig
[339.04 → 345.12] SST what about it USB type c so you can plug into an external dock no I think it's a great idea what
[345.12 → 351.42] about it is not daily driver capable I think it's a great idea, so I'm I'm going to do it I'm going to run it
[351.42 → 358.10] for a month, and I'm going to report on my findings because valve has already got games on their
[358.10 → 365.60] validated list that I had trouble with when I was left to my own devices so if valve says hey it's
[365.60 → 373.70] going to do it I you probably I'm excited on this but they said the entire steam library they said that
[373.70 → 381.96] very early on and I pressed x to doubt and right now what I can say is that steam's validated game
[381.96 → 387.98] or valve's validated game list is not the entire steam library far from and that doesn't surprise me
[387.98 → 394.52] at all no that's what I can say right now okay yep yeah I mean good you remember me calling BS on
[394.52 → 399.54] that right out of the gate right yeah so that's that's actually insane like oh yeah it's impossible
[399.54 → 404.12] there 's's unless, and I know they're working on it, and they've actually made huge grounds and
[404.12 → 407.84] there's still that website you can look at it is has been getting slightly better etc etc etc but
[407.84 → 414.48] the anti-cheat problem is like a thing and that's just I don't know they'd have to convince a lot of
[414.48 → 420.46] old games to do updates to be compatible with this which is a very hard thing to convince developers
[420.46 → 426.34] to do yes that's fair let me go back to this old game that we haven't made any money from in a long
[426.34 → 433.96] time and like spend dev time on it that seems like good business all right speaking of good business
[433.96 → 441.90] apparently consumers who buy motherboards on new egg are being denied refunds for what are claims to be
[441.90 → 447.52] ineligible products except that this doesn't make any sense because apparently the motherboards are
[447.52 → 456.26] often new in box, so new egg makes the claim that the CPU sockets have customer caused damage to the
[456.26 → 462.44] CPU pins, and they're saying that that's their reason for withholding funds from people seeking
[462.44 → 469.44] a RMA gamers nexus stumbled into this situation by returning a 500 motherboard that was purchased but
[469.44 → 475.82] no longer required which they actually mentioned in their refund request new egg responded that customer
[475.82 → 485.88] caused damage had been done to the CPU pins and denied gamers nexus's RMA i have to say when we've done
[485.88 → 492.20] things like secret shopper in the past we've actually jumped through a lot of hoops even going as far as
[492.20 → 500.92] to use the credit cards of relatives of employees when placing orders to ensure that no one catches that it's us
[502.12 → 513.00] and apparently you didn't even need to gamers nexus can just contact customer support for new egg get some Rube who has no idea who they are
[513.00 → 523.64] who denies them a RMA for some BS reason because and we know that this is BS gamers nexus never opened the motherboard
[523.64 → 533.40] it was a brand-new inbox motherboard now for the uninitiated LGA sockets are very fragile they have these
[533.40 → 540.44] little tiny pins in them have you ever bent them uh yeah yeah me too uh they are extremely easy to
[540.44 → 546.44] accidentally bend and once you bend them you're I mean here I can bleep you let's try and time it ready
[547.00 → 552.44] once once once you bend them you're I hope we got it
[554.20 → 560.28] pretty much we tried you can sometimes perform delicate surgery pick them up sometimes if you just
[560.28 → 564.20] squish them down you can lift them back up again yeah, but it's a little sketchy and everyone's a
[564.20 → 569.80] little spooked about that socket from there on yeah oh absolutely yeah you're always
[569.80 → 574.92] concerned you never want to swap that CPO once you get it working and typically a brand-new board comes
[574.92 → 581.16] with a hard plastic shield over those delicate pins to protect them during shipping but in spite of this
[581.16 → 588.28] many retailers actually require a visual inspection of the socket at the point of sale just as a way of
[588.28 → 594.76] covering their own butts because and I can tell you this from experience how often it happens that
[594.76 → 602.20] customers claim they didn't touch it or claim that it was unopened when actually they did touch it and
[602.20 → 607.72] actually it was not unopened and people are going to do that for sure is a lot more than you'd think
[607.72 → 615.32] because I think for a lot of people the rationalization is as simple as I simply cannot afford another
[615.32 → 620.68] motherboard and a lot of people cannot that's that's just reality this was literally everything
[620.68 → 629.08] I had i I need to do something um I feel like this wasn't my fault the universe conspired against
[629.08 → 637.32] people like whatever hoops they jump over to piracy to rational to rationalize it he's not gonna
[637.32 → 643.32] let this go I'm trying to move on today I told him before the show started I was like look we're not
[643.32 → 651.56] going to have I'm not going to have any hot takes today I'm keeping it ice-cold like in a Ltd water bottle
[651.56 → 664.04] like in this lttstore.com no hot takes today he keeps drawing me back in so it is extremely common um
[664.04 → 674.04] for customers to do that oh okay sorry okay point of clarification uh gamers nexus's motherboard was brand new to him
[674.04 → 680.04] but it was open box okay so they did actually buy a refurbished motherboard in the first place, but they had not
[680.04 → 686.04] opened it yeah it shouldn't matter yeah which doesn't which doesn't matter for the purposes of our conversation here
[686.04 → 693.64] for gamers nexus they had never touched the motherboard they never even opened the box yes it was opened at some point
[693.64 → 699.24] so anyway coming back to the coming back to customers claiming that they didn't touch stuff
[699.24 → 707.56] the amount of times that we have seen obvious physical damage in the form of everything from
[707.56 → 714.76] shorts that no we're not from a capacitor being soldered on backwards like AMD's AMD like Asus's recent fiasco
[714.76 → 722.36] uh or like water damage right like terrible stuff is a lot more than you'd think and I think
[722.36 → 728.68] that most people out there most people most of you in the chat are probably by and large imagining that
[728.68 → 734.68] people who would try to pull that kind of scam are few and far between but from my experience it's
[734.68 → 741.48] absolutely not true it's not true there's a lot of people out there like I'd worked in retail and had
[741.48 → 746.36] people try and pull them pull one over on me all the time but because I'm pretty sad actually is that
[746.36 → 752.44] potentially an exposure problem because like I remember when I worked at geek squad um I used
[752.44 → 758.60] to think and I mean they weren't exactly doing great but I used to think uh that hp laptops were just the
[758.60 → 764.12] the worst thing ever because it was like the only thing that we would ever get coming in with problems was
[764.12 → 770.20] hp laptops and then I was talking to one of my mentors in geek squad uh, and he was like well have you
[770.20 → 775.24] looked at like the sales numbers that were pushing through the store for laptops like well no and
[775.24 → 779.00] then you pointed out that it's like 80 something percent hp laptops at that time so he's like what
[779.00 → 784.68] do you think is going to come back it's like okay they weren't great obviously yep, but it still was
[784.68 → 790.36] skewed by that whole stuff do you think it's potentially an exposure problem you were noticing
[790.36 → 797.56] these issues largely like what percentage of RMA things do you think were actual user problems that
[797.56 → 804.12] they were covering up oh absolutely most of them were legitimate problems but what I'm trying to say
[804.12 → 811.88] is that if you see a hundred threads on Reddit of people claiming that something like that something
[811.88 → 819.08] was physically damaged out of an out of a new box a not insignificant percentage of them are lying
[819.08 → 823.64] I mean you see a lot of that kind of stuff across the board divided says your experience is also
[823.64 → 830.20] outdated you're right in the last 12 years people have gotten so much better and more honest that's
[830.20 → 834.44] absolutely a thing that happened we've definitely seen that globally we've seen a really positive trend
[834.44 → 839.64] yeah um yeah I mean you see this across the board right you see this with cheaters video games you see
[839.64 → 847.48] this with everything so okay who knows now let's talk about the other chance here okay
[847.48 → 853.80] because gamers nexus purchased an open box motherboard it is entirely possible that it was
[853.80 → 860.68] actually a missed bent pin or missed socket damage from the previous customer you know what else is
[860.68 → 868.28] possible it's possible that this particular motherboard there could have been nothing wrong with it at all
[868.28 → 874.04] we haven't actually gotten word from new egg about that particular chance and I've actually got
[874.04 → 878.20] an additional chance for you there's a lot of people in chat that are like so Linus says blame
[878.20 → 885.40] the customer no that's not what i said that it's absolutely a chance so don't take on what
[885.40 → 891.80] I'm saying is don't take one side automatically at all because there are a lot of different possible
[891.80 → 900.12] outcomes now for the motherboard itself the odds that the retailer damaged the socket are extremely low
[900.12 → 908.12] yeah like minuscule low because even at NCI where we did put our own label on motherboards up
[908.12 → 914.60] until like 2007 or something like that even though they obviously have serial numbers i was like why
[914.60 → 918.92] are we doing this why do we put our own serial number on every product um they were like because
[918.92 → 924.60] that's the way we've always done it I'm like okay sure I guess so uh 2006 2008 I don't remember but
[924.60 → 929.64] some sometime around there they actually put their own labels on everything um I remember that so even
[929.64 → 934.28] though NCI did that they would act they actually had a way of doing it that they wouldn't even
[934.28 → 940.68] open up the tape over the ESD bag on the motherboard they would slit the bag slide in using
[940.68 → 945.48] a knife slide in the thing press it down and pull the knife out and apply it that way so there is
[945.48 → 951.16] no reason for a retailer to open up the box of a product other than the one that they might open to
[951.16 → 957.40] take pictures, and you'd notice if the socket was bent um in fact even that one would just be sold as open
[957.40 → 966.28] box uh probably, but that's another that's another thing okay motherboards don't come shrink-wrapped
[969.32 → 973.56] okay because i something I've been thinking of this whole time is wouldn't they wouldn't
[973.56 → 978.36] they said they didn't open it wouldn't it just be shrink-wrapped but yeah no so that's something that
[978.36 → 984.52] I have wondered about for many years really this is a 500 board though a lot of high-end boards don't
[984.52 → 990.52] they have a sticker over the not necessarily motherboard manufacturers for whatever reason
[990.52 → 997.16] and I've never I've never actually asked but I've always been curious good I'm not against that but
[997.16 → 1004.84] motherboard manufacturers do not generally shrink wrap even their very high-end products, and it seems
[1004.84 → 1014.84] to me that if they really wanted to put this to rest forever sealing the product would probably be a
[1014.84 → 1023.32] pretty good way to do it yeah but here's the issue I have seen bent pins and sockets uh geom aster
[1023.32 → 1027.96] yeah three seven on flow plane chat said but gamers nexus didn't open the box it was shipped in
[1027.96 → 1033.80] okay that's a whole separate conversation that's okay we're not even we're not even talking about
[1033.80 → 1039.56] the gamers' nexus uh scenario in particular I'm talking about in general because here's the problem
[1040.20 → 1048.60] I have had this experience I have had the experience of opening up a brand-new board and because I'm me
[1048.60 → 1056.12] it didn't even go to a retailer it came straight from the manufacturer and I was the first person to open
[1056.12 → 1069.24] it and I've seen bent pins so what I'm saying right now is that let's take every account of this
[1069.24 → 1076.68] happening with a grain of salt understanding that there are multiple chances here a chance
[1077.32 → 1084.20] is that the customer is lying another chance is that because motherboards do not come in sealed
[1084.20 → 1091.48] packages the retailer could easily be let's say for example throwing together a quick test bench
[1092.04 → 1099.48] yeah in order to something putting it really nicely back into the box and selling it as new that's a
[1099.48 → 1107.08] possibility number three it could have just actually been bent straight from the factory so
[1107.08 → 1113.80] there are three possible avenues for actual damage to the CPU socket yeah now in the case of
[1113.80 → 1120.76] Steve what I suspect is most likely because this was an open box board in the first place is that
[1120.76 → 1126.12] whoever are made it in the first place validation was poor whether that damage came from the factory
[1126.12 → 1133.00] or whether they caused it they managed to get one in under the radar whoever was the tech at new egg
[1133.00 → 1138.44] who inspected it or maybe didn't even bother I don't know whoever was the tech who inspected it didn't
[1138.44 → 1143.56] catch the bent pin it can be a little bit tricky to see them sometimes you can get it just right yeah and it
[1143.56 → 1149.32] ended up back on the shelf, and it was sent to Steve now because Steve didn't actually open the box
[1151.24 → 1157.56] he actually wouldn't know if there was any thermal compound on the socket or if it had any bent pins
[1157.56 → 1163.64] or if there was any other kind of physical damage to it because he never looked at it and then new egg
[1163.64 → 1169.96] is basically going well it's impossible that there was anything wrong with it before we sent it
[1169.96 → 1177.88] which by the way as I already outlined for you guys is not impossible doing a typical computer
[1177.88 → 1185.64] retailer thing which is going not my problem and pushing it back to the customer do I think that
[1185.64 → 1194.52] new egg is actually running some kind of concerted scam where they are trying to take people's RMA
[1194.52 → 1204.92] motherboards back and keep their money I sincerely doubt it um I feel like that's the kind of thing that
[1204.92 → 1210.44] would be whistle blown at some point I think they could be pushing those people to be abnormally strict
[1210.44 → 1218.20] though I think so not like a concerted scam of like hey, hey uh RMA specialist people just
[1218.20 → 1223.72] refuse all of them tell them all they have socket damage but like maybe weighing really heavily on
[1223.72 → 1228.68] employee reviews or something on like oh you accepted too many motherboards with sketchy
[1228.68 → 1233.64] pins and being really really really hard on them well the right amount of motherboards to accept with
[1233.64 → 1239.40] sketchy pins from a new egg point of view where apparently you're making the assumption that it can't
[1239.40 → 1247.24] happen um would be zero yeah and here's another problem is that the retailer is often the first
[1247.24 → 1252.68] line of defence against the customer when a lot of the time it's actually not their policy so here's
[1252.68 → 1259.56] something that you guys might not realize is that Asus gigabyte and MSI they also as rock for that
[1259.56 → 1265.40] matter they also live in a magical fantasy land where it is entirely possible impossible for a motherboard
[1265.40 → 1271.72] to leave their factory with bent pins in it so if you try to RMA as a retailer if you try to RMA a
[1271.72 → 1276.44] motherboard with socket damage they will refuse it, and you will be out the entire value of that motherboard
[1277.16 → 1288.20] so the question now to ask is okay who's where should this burden lie should it lie with new egg knowing
[1288.20 → 1295.48] that and I know this for a fact people damage things and lie about it should it lie with new egg should
[1295.48 → 1301.24] it lies with the manufacturer should it lie with the consumer the honest answers to all three of those
[1301.24 → 1310.52] questions are no yeah because there is so much uncertainty who should have to eat it every single time
[1310.52 → 1318.28] because I can tell you guys the retailer does not make the kind of margin that you might imagine
[1318.28 → 1328.44] that they do i know a lot of motherboards get individually validated I don't know if that's
[1328.44 → 1334.44] true about everything 500 board might part of individual validation is potentially screwing it up
[1334.44 → 1340.52] yeah but i wonder how expensive documenting that validation would be
[1343.16 → 1348.84] because if you could have like photo evidence of your socket as it's leaving, and you can and if
[1348.84 → 1352.68] someone's like oh this was screwed up at the manufacturer, and they can be like nope picture
[1354.36 → 1361.40] that would kind of exclude one of those and then if I think especially for open box products
[1361.40 → 1368.92] if new egg would would would document the status of the product as it's being repackaged that would
[1368.92 → 1376.20] probably help their stance as well, so the problem is that new eggs whole situation with gamers nexus was
[1376.20 → 1382.36] a comedy of errors so it's a lot more than just this debate over pins which I did want to talk about
[1382.36 → 1387.80] because there's a lot of there are sides of it that I feel like people might not have considered
[1387.80 → 1395.08] yeah the issue though is that he never opened the board new egg claimed there was thermal compound in
[1395.08 → 1402.12] the socket despite the motherboard having never been opened by him and making problems even worse they
[1402.12 → 1407.08] actually asked to have the board sent back to them new egg claimed they sent it back and then so far
[1407.08 → 1417.64] to my knowledge has not actually provided a tracking number so making this even more complicated
[1417.64 → 1422.04] since the release of their video exposing the situation gamers nexus has apparently been flooded
[1422.04 → 1426.84] with similar accounts from viewers who have tried to return their gear and a number of their followers
[1426.84 → 1435.16] are now pledging to boycott new egg um lewis Grossman has apparently weighed in asking what even
[1435.16 → 1439.80] happened to new egg who actually used to be known for their good service apparently I'm not American so
[1439.80 → 1444.92] i never really shopped there because by the time they opened up in Canada I was working at a competitor so
[1444.92 → 1449.56] I wasn't going to like shop there yeah I would just walk into the warehouse and buy something if i really
[1449.56 → 1455.08] needed to um, but the response seems to be that they were purchased by liaison interactive a Chinese
[1455.08 → 1467.08] tech company in 2016. All right who do you boycott them with I mean man there used to be there used to be
[1467.08 → 1474.04] so many more options man fries there used to be uh tiger direct there used to be zip zoom fly
[1474.76 → 1481.32] uh it's m wave still around I feel like that's been a hot minute uh you've got micro centre
[1482.60 → 1487.64] so micro centre still exists oh yeah they're not in Canada right yeah oh not in Canada no but in
[1487.64 → 1493.80] I'm we're talking Americans yeah uh tiger direct LMAO yeah yeah a lot of people are talking about
[1493.80 → 1499.56] micro centre in the twitch chat uh in the flip plane chat I did a sponsored event where I'm not
[1499.56 → 1506.12] going to say who, but a company flew me out to go do a thing uh, and we were building computers and the
[1506.84 → 1512.28] parts showed up late, and we were unboxing all the parts or not unboxing but taking all the parts out
[1512.28 → 1519.16] and then we realized that there was a component missing yeah um, and we had to go to a micro centre
[1519.16 → 1526.44] to go pick up said component yeah it's a cool place yeah there's a really, really big store like i
[1526.44 → 1533.72] and I know that's like just some Canadian dude in America going like whoa, but it was huge it was
[1533.72 → 1538.28] crazy and I heard that fries electronics was significantly bigger which is cool I'm
[1538.28 → 1545.40] used to like the I mean going to CX when I was growing up it's this little like tiny little sliver hole in
[1545.40 → 1549.88] the wall yeah you basically go up to an order desk and just get your stuff like there 's's
[1549.88 → 1556.28] extremely limited browsing if basically any like the Langley location had like two shelf things
[1556.84 → 1562.12] and I was like it then it was usually filled with just like cases that I assumed they couldn't fit in
[1562.12 → 1567.40] the back because it covered most of the floor um so yeah it was an I don't know its kind of a cool
[1567.40 → 1572.12] experience man honestly this just makes me feel like LTT stores should just be a computer store
[1572.12 → 1579.24] like seriously the margins are just so thin though you know what so here's a crazy concept
[1579.96 → 1585.80] what if we just what if our margins just weren't that thin what if we just took an extra two percent
[1585.80 → 1594.20] and then just had no customer service like there's a novel idea but i I don't know I don't I don't know
[1594.20 → 1602.92] I mean you look at how price driven it purchasers are right like in what other space does a site like
[1602.92 → 1611.32] pc part picker even exist in the makeup space is there a pc part picker is there a face paint picker.com
[1611.88 → 1616.28] right where you could, you can make that you can actually probably be good money in that
[1616.28 → 1623.80] your lip eye uh facial compound whatever you like you, you put in your whole regimen, and it tells you
[1623.80 → 1629.24] the cheapest site to go buy it like honestly I don't think there is I don't think there is airline
[1629.24 → 1636.52] tickets okay that that's a good one probably actually navy a big money idea yeah is like
[1637.32 → 1645.08] a face painting thing where once you were done like creating your person yeah there would be like if you
[1645.08 → 1653.16] buy this shopping list of products you can achieve this look, and it just adds to cart yeah that would
[1653.16 → 1658.04] actually probably be oh it would do great, but there's just it's just I've never seen anything
[1658.04 → 1665.16] quite like the way that its enthusiasts are driven by price like I remember having this conversation with
[1665.16 → 1670.52] Asus one time when they came out showing us their whole lineup of upcoming motherboards for I mean
[1670.52 → 1676.20] it must have been z68 or something like that at this point z77 I don't know it was like it was way
[1676.20 → 1681.88] way back a thousand years ago and I was looking at going I think this is madness I mean these are the
[1681.88 → 1686.28] only two skews that sell anyway deluxe the pro actually three skews you got deluxe the pro and
[1686.28 → 1693.80] the lx or LE or whatever the like the basic one is, and then you got your mate nothing else
[1693.80 → 1699.72] actually moves in any appreciable volume at least from our perspective so why don't you just take
[1699.72 → 1704.92] those two and this was pre-lab right I was like why don't you just take those two ship them in three
[1704.92 → 1711.08] different colours do a blue one a red one and like an all black one and like honestly I think that would
[1711.08 → 1717.00] be that would be more to customers taste because remember I was coming at it from like an enthusiast
[1717.00 → 1723.32] system standpoint right so I'm I'm looking at it going you guys have no idea do you how many people
[1723.32 → 1728.92] choose a gigabyte motherboard for the blue colour scheme compared to your product like actually i
[1728.92 → 1733.96] think Asus's was blue at that point as well, but maybe it was MSI and some other colour uh but I was
[1733.96 → 1738.04] just sitting here going you have no idea how many people choose a motherboard based on the colour do
[1738.04 → 1743.48] you could just say you could have the same number of skews and just have a few different colours
[1743.48 → 1748.60] of the ones people actually buy and I think you'd be better off, and they were like no Linus you have
[1748.60 → 1754.44] no idea the three dollar difference between these two allow us to capture like this some
[1754.44 → 1760.36] percentage additional sales because someone else will have one will undercut us by two dollars and
[1760.36 → 1770.44] like people will flock to it, I'm like really okay fine sure I guess that's I guess that's apparently how
[1770.44 → 1778.04] it works um people are talking about Amazon as an alternative to new egg but Amazon has their own set of
[1778.04 → 1783.48] issues guys like let's not pretend that Amazon is some kind of saint that's going to rescue us from
[1783.48 → 1789.96] big bad new egg good customer service yes good everything else it gets a little bit more challenging
[1789.96 → 1798.84] with Amazon DFI yeah bring back DFI heck yeah love it oh that's a that's and that's an old memory yeah
[1798.84 → 1805.32] no kidding right oh I'd love it what was that graphics card brand that had lifetime warranties
[1805.32 → 1811.80] uh oh was it gainward did gainward have a lifetime warranty at some oh bfg yeah good old BFG oh
[1812.76 → 1819.40] awesome uh they were doomed to fail it was awesome Alden Comey says hey Linus wouldn't the two percent
[1819.40 → 1825.56] extra margin basically be the warranties that dell and others pedal I mean yeah you could think about it
[1825.56 → 1833.00] that way that is an important realization that you just had Aiden comely there is no free lunch
[1834.68 → 1840.60] it's true though yeah it's true though a lot of people don't consider it that same buddy I told you
[1840.60 → 1846.84] about yeah that uh I said mentor at geek squad or whatever yeah he had that tattooed on his arm just
[1846.84 → 1853.00] just the acronym there's no such thing as a free lunch it's very true it's so true and i I think
[1853.00 → 1857.56] that there's just this expectation like a lot of the times we fall victim to the monsters we've created
[1858.36 → 1866.44] why is it that you know you're why is it that you know service at this chain restaurant is so bad
[1867.08 → 1872.28] because you went there you went to that chain restaurant instead of supporting a local
[1872.28 → 1879.16] entrepreneur that actually cares yep that that's why yeah and because the server doesn't get paid
[1879.16 → 1883.96] enough you're going there, so other people saw that this place is being attended so they're like it's
[1883.96 → 1889.96] probably not that bad so then they might go there etc so we we all contribute to these problems
[1889.96 → 1895.16] that we than that we then suffer from, and you know things like I said not being willing to pay
[1895.16 → 1899.72] another dollar or another two dollars more or whatever the case may be means that yeah at some point
[1899.72 → 1906.36] customer service is going to suffer and it industry is notoriously low margin there are a
[1906.36 → 1912.04] couple of big fish that are making the vast majority of the money in it industry and their names are
[1912.04 → 1921.88] intel AMD only lately though um Microsoft uh who else is actually making money NVIDIA actually makes money
[1923.88 → 1929.64] NVIDIA let's see is there anyone else that's I mean I know that the guys like in Asus are making money
[1929.64 → 1936.76] but it's only due to their just astronomical scale and when you're someone like an VGA you know you
[1936.76 → 1942.28] are you are trying to find you're always trying to find new higher margin businesses to expand into
[1942.28 → 1949.24] because I know for a fact they're not making money on selling GPUs apple absolutely makes money
[1949.96 → 1955.88] apple I left out because I don't really consider apple an product company they're a consumer electronics
[1955.88 → 1963.40] company and i the reason I draw that line is because they don't sell any components if that kind of
[1963.40 → 1969.96] makes sense to you guys everything that apple sells is already based on the user experience rather than
[1969.96 → 1976.60] the speeds and feeds of the component that they are shipping to you, and so they're a little bit uh
[1976.60 → 1981.08] they're they're a tier they're a tier above there's a lot of people in chat just listing
[1982.04 → 1987.72] companies that develop software or websites that's not the point yeah it or hardware yeah
[1987.72 → 1993.56] and especially enthusiast computer hardware yep um because once you get into you mentioned it once
[1993.56 → 1999.72] you get into enterprise stuff margins start to kind of oh yeah totally different definitely come back
[1999.72 → 2010.44] totally different story totally different story IBM come on what what what I okay come on guys yeah
[2010.44 → 2016.76] IBM is a technology company yes but I wouldn't call them I wouldn't call them like an company in
[2016.76 → 2021.32] the sense that we're talking about when we say it industry we're we're talking about like the computer
[2021.32 → 2027.96] hardware industry and maybe that's just one of those things where I'm used to using that lingo because
[2027.96 → 2033.00] within it industry that's how we refer to ourselves so we would talk about things like
[2034.12 → 2040.28] a receiver or a television as consumer electronics because they're sort of a pre-packaged
[2040.28 → 2046.84] thing, and we would talk about software as like software and services industry um so there that's
[2046.84 → 2050.60] the clarification that I should give you guys that's why I'm using that terminology the way that
[2050.60 → 2057.48] I do Noctua yep, yep part path arty or whatever your name is yeah like fans and cases yep that's a
[2057.48 → 2062.20] company that makes money hand over fist as far as I can tell they're smart they're super smart
[2062.20 → 2067.88] peripherals have always kind of survived with better margins peripherals seem like they're getting pretty
[2067.88 → 2074.12] tough man probably do you see how much you see how much a g502 Proteus or g502 hero goes for now
[2074.68 → 2081.80] it's like 45 bucks yeah for a hero sensor like the tooling cost so much on a device like that space
[2081.80 → 2085.48] and so many new companies coming in well it's because everyone flocked to it going oh well
[2085.48 → 2088.76] there's margin here it's kind of like what happened with power supplies there used to be great margin
[2088.76 → 2094.20] in power supplies and then everyone and their dog came in dumped all over it oh we're a fan company we
[2094.20 → 2099.40] make power supplies now yeah exactly that happened like crazy we put a power supply around our fan
[2101.00 → 2106.92] you're welcome good job hey fun fact uh speaking of power supply companies did you know that adtech still
[2106.92 → 2113.88] exists no yeah I thought we did a show on them not existing no, no no they totally still exist check this
[2113.88 → 2124.60] out so I was thinking of doing an adtech build like an all adtech pc right how cool would that be i
[2124.60 → 2130.12] haven't even heard this name they even have DF as a product line name still does it still stand for
[2130.12 → 2140.12] dark fleet I have no idea the original dark fleet was awful whoa whoa a cash for 51 you need to
[2140.12 → 2153.24] sit down adtech are a PSU company cases surely are you serious right now no, no no, no no, no you need
[2153.24 → 2162.28] you need you need to sit down okay adtech is the OG power supply company oh yeah along with
[2162.28 → 2167.48] enter max I think pretty much everyone I knew had an adtech power supply at least at one point for
[2167.48 → 2175.48] enthusiasts for gamers adtech was the yeah okay back in the day oh yeah apparently they're huge in
[2175.48 → 2186.76] Bangladesh still it's sitting yeah for real yeah man my first enthusiast build adtech land boy with built-in
[2186.76 → 2196.44] blue led lit 350 watt power supply love is one of my good buddies uh used to have a lamb boy air nice
[2197.00 → 2203.88] just the dust machine dude that was a unique that was a unique case yeah okay it was an unusual case it
[2203.88 → 2211.88] definitely was this is cool i I really thought they didn't are they still like in North America I don't
[2211.88 → 2217.00] know as far as i as far as I can tell yes I haven't actually tried to buy any of their stuff but it
[2217.00 → 2222.04] kind of seems like it, and they're they're doing a lot of sorts of normal looking stuff they're also
[2222.04 → 2227.16] doing some weird stuff they've got this reverse fan which is what actually brought them back on my radar
[2227.16 → 2236.28] so it's a fan that blows air away from the hub instead of the other way why don't you just
[2236.28 → 2245.88] why you need this I have no idea oh okay no I get it I actually get it now for aesthetics so you don't
[2245.88 → 2255.72] have to see the label okay it's uh a very champagne problem for sure, but it okay i I get it at least
[2256.44 → 2262.68] I understand okay what are we supposed to be talking about now Australia Bangladesh Belgium Canada
[2262.68 → 2273.88] yeah where's us so USA yeah back to new eggs uh scummy return system um I guess yeah what I want
[2273.88 → 2279.40] to know is I want to hear from you guys if you've had the same experience I want you guys to know that
[2279.40 → 2287.96] there's probably a mixture of blame to go around it certainly doesn't all lie on new egg however in the
[2287.96 → 2294.68] case of what happened with Steve it looks like it's pretty clear that this was either new egg
[2294.68 → 2302.44] screwing up or new egg ripping him off, and it's very hard for me to tell exactly which one either way
[2302.44 → 2310.52] they picked the wrong guy to screw with like yeah I would absolutely be creeping like major tech
[2310.52 → 2316.12] media outlets and seeing who works there and making sure that they're all just on the do fly list
[2316.12 → 2320.20] yeah I was like I didn't even really want to say it because like I don't want to give them ideas
[2320.20 → 2327.88] but yeah I would if I worked there like why would you not I would absolutely do that and like yes your
[2327.88 → 2332.92] your company should have standards that are high enough that it shouldn't matter absolutely but i
[2332.92 → 2340.04] would make sure that if Steven Burke buys something from lttstore.com and sends in a support ticket he is
[2340.04 → 2346.20] getting the white glove service I will personally Steven Burke I will personally reply to your support
[2346.20 → 2352.84] ticket oh crap I probably won't yeah now you have to tell the customer support people that yeah no
[2352.84 → 2357.24] what forget you know what I take it back I take it back I will not personally reply to your support ticket
[2358.28 → 2365.16] oh man you guys should have a reverse policy where like if Steven Burke buys something on store you
[2365.16 → 2370.28] like screw him over I know right we should just ship him a bag of sand at his cost
[2374.44 → 2379.32] oh man like this is how companies usually treat you so it's probably fine yeah exactly you're used
[2379.32 → 2388.12] to it, you're used to it Steve give him the new egg special yeah I love it all right um what else are we
[2388.12 → 2397.72] supposed to talk about today uh oh yeah Sony to acquire bungee for 3.6 billion how ironic is this
[2398.60 → 2405.88] very, very funny very interesting I mean I'm a little I'm a little rough around the edges on the history
[2405.88 → 2416.36] here okay but was it not bungee that put the Xbox on the map at all wasn't the Xbox kind of just a black
[2416.36 → 2427.32] box until like come on man and i I can try to go find the quote right now but um the head of
[2427.32 → 2434.36] Xbox if I remember correctly fairly recently in an interview was talked to about bungee, and he talked
[2434.36 → 2441.64] about how like he feels that modern Xbox like the company not the console yeah would be able to retain
[2441.64 → 2447.56] bungee, and he was like yeah like we didn't like maybe I don't know how he worded it and I'm not
[2447.56 → 2449.88] reading the article in front of me, but it's something along the lines of like we didn't
[2449.88 → 2453.96] necessarily deserve them at the time like we weren't doing the right things we weren't facilitating
[2453.96 → 2458.20] right properly all this kind of stuff but I think we would now we are now all that kind of stuff
[2459.16 → 2465.32] I would not be surprised if there was conversation going on there, and then they went to Sony which is
[2465.32 → 2476.44] fascinating it's just crazy also 3.6 billion when like I'm pretty sure it's just destiny right
[2476.44 → 2481.72] now they do say like uh bungee of course is studio behind the original halo which is still owned by
[2481.72 → 2487.72] Microsoft and the following franchises marathon pre-halo fps that's like I really don't see them
[2487.72 → 2497.32] doing anything with marathon yeah myth ONI and destiny so destiny okay is this only as
[2497.32 → 2504.20] an ONI of the dark forest it's worth mentioning that while other titles from acquired
[2504.20 → 2509.48] studios have remained cross-platform for contractual reason bungee's future contractual reasons bungee's
[2509.48 → 2515.00] future plan titles are still slated to come out on other platforms in addition bungee says that they
[2515.00 → 2521.48] will be retaining creative freedom although I mean yeah I don't know I don't I don't I don't know how
[2521.48 → 2529.00] you I don't know how you can say that with complete certainty like if I sold Linus media group and the
[2529.00 → 2537.96] buyer said you will retain creative freedom maybe there's a way to write a contract that actually guarantees
[2537.96 → 2544.20] it but I also feel like the buyer would be crazy some type of loophole there's something they can do
[2544.20 → 2548.84] they'd be crazy not to have a clause in the contract that says I mean well if you screw it up then
[2548.84 → 2554.12] we're coming in, and they could probably also just fire you yeah we'll oust you yeah um it's like you
[2554.12 → 2558.76] look at oculus, and they just fired them right they just fired like everybody from the original team
[2558.76 → 2564.28] ONI is uh is not what I thought it's not only in the dark forest it's just called ONI, and it was
[2564.28 → 2570.92] released in 2001. So as far as I can tell all these uh all these things are just done except for
[2570.92 → 2578.28] destiny is big destiny is a big game it's been very successful every time they release an
[2578.28 → 2582.68] expansion whatever it sells really well people in that community seem pretty happy for the most part
[2582.68 → 2592.36] yeah so like it's a big thing for Sony to get but 3.6 billion bang bang it's um yeah consolidation bad
[2592.36 → 2598.44] I don't think we need to go over that way too much more um yeah there's uh there's some
[2598.44 → 2605.08] speculation that Sony is after IP there uh game engine technology there's some speculation that
[2605.08 → 2610.20] Sony might want to move into more of a publishing role um maybe it's a cloud gaming move
[2610.84 → 2617.32] um Sony does cite bungee's experience with multi-platform development and live game services as
[2617.32 → 2622.28] a primary motivator for the purchase which they're honestly they're they're multi-platform live game
[2622.28 → 2628.04] service is having been just killing it for a long time so that's very legit uh people in chat are also
[2628.04 → 2633.72] saying new IP is coming so yep that probably makes sense as well that's pretty that's pretty fair it's
[2633.72 → 2640.52] I would, I also think and I'm sure everyone is aware of this that buying bungee is a bit of a blow to
[2640.52 → 2646.68] Microsoft oh oh i I think it's pretty clear that there's a message being sent here and I wouldn't be
[2646.68 → 2654.76] surprised if a little bit of that price tag was like hey come on you are uh you are buying bungee away
[2654.76 → 2659.56] from Microsoft even if they don't own it um because they were kind of dangling out there on their own
[2659.56 → 2665.72] for a little while right and uh being attached to something that is not Microsoft now is a statement
[2665.72 → 2673.48] even though they weren't owned by microsoft can still just buy Sony oh my god well
[2674.68 → 2680.36] I don't see that I don't see that ever happening that's not going to be allowed yeah the Japanese
[2680.36 → 2685.64] government is just not going to let that be a thing I just think the American government would either
[2685.64 → 2689.96] like I don't think anyone's going to be cool with that yeah i I don't think that's happening guys
[2690.60 → 2695.56] what is happening though sponsor spots absolutely let's do it uh the show is brought to
[2695.56 → 2703.48] you today by grid studio uh grid studios art frames show off the art hidden inside technology
[2703.48 → 2709.16] oh okay you talk about the next bit i have to grab something uh okay like the next monster spot
[2709.16 → 2718.12] no, no just the next talking oh okay uh apparently over a billion of the money for bungee no, no no, no
[2718.12 → 2725.80] for grid studio okay hold on oh using the art of knelling every part from your favourite phone or console
[2726.44 → 2736.28] is carefully extracted laid out this is actually super cool and labelled in clear view oh they sent an

[2909.64 → 2913.64] know which one is right but one of them is you'll figure it out you'll, I believe that this is smart
[2914.92 → 2921.48] you know it's not smart Facebook you know what's sad what I wore this in morning today
[2921.48 → 2930.20] oh Ltd 2019 shirt thanks for that yeah anyway yeah Facebook 252 billion dollars gone uh as far as
[2930.20 → 2937.16] Wikipedia is concerned the GDP of Finland um wow amazing and to be clear we're not talking actual
[2937.16 → 2944.92] dollars we're talking valuation calculated value um yeah brutal apparently average usage of Facebook
[2944.92 → 2951.96] dipped for the first time ever leading to concern that Instagram may not be far behind uh meta's CFO
[2951.96 → 2959.32] Dave Werner blames when part winner I don't know sure uh blames part of the decrease on fewer
[2959.32 → 2965.48] covet 19 lockdowns darn you should really uh crank on that a little more uh which historically generated a
[2965.48 → 2975.96] boom in online activity I mean he's not wrong but like why would you say that exactly why that sounds
[2976.60 → 2985.00] uh like you're the CFO of meta um yeah kind of doesn't it also blamed the rising internet costs in
[2985.00 → 2990.04] India and rising interest in ticktock which analysts say is hurting Instagram's growth to combat
[2990.04 → 2994.92] ticktock Instagram has been investing billions of dollars and lots of development time into the
[2994.92 → 3000.04] development of more video related features which they say is their like fastest growing thing on
[3000.04 → 3006.92] Instagram Reels fastest growing format by far but is not popular yet to attract similar ad
[3006.92 → 3016.84] sales to traditional Facebook services yeah so um as a result of these challenges including lower than
[3016.84 → 3024.36] expected revenue megabook has lost 252 billion that's with nine zeros on the end, and they aren't alone
[3024.36 → 3029.48] twitter snap and Pinterest all closed lower on Thursday however Shopify has been struggling too
[3029.48 → 3034.44] a lot of tech stocks have been struck this is interesting megabook's wideout here is the biggest
[3034.44 → 3044.84] crash in a single day in stock market history 26.3 of the company's value evaporated nice and this
[3044.84 → 3050.84] isn't the first time their stock crashed in 2018 they also lost 19 of their value over slowing user growth
[3050.84 → 3057.16] yeah like a lot of the speculated value of that company is based on projected eventual growth yes
[3057.16 → 3062.36] so if is they stop growing then everyone goes whoa whoa whoa and if they even stop growing like crazy
[3062.36 → 3068.84] yeah because so much of it is just based on speculation that they can only go to the moon yeah
[3069.40 → 3076.92] which is not it's not true stocks only go up oh man that's how it works um yeah brutal
[3076.92 → 3085.64] so our discussion question here is Facebook dying or is this just more of a more of a snap
[3085.64 → 3090.84] back to a more realistic valuation after pandemic highs Facebook that we're talking about right now is
[3090.84 → 3095.08] is the greater Facebook services or whatever you want to call them that includes Instagram
[3095.08 → 3101.08] yes, yes I think Facebook, so meta fine let's call them meta sure megabook I like megabook better
[3101.08 → 3105.88] mine yeah megabook because that maybe doesn't include VR stuff I don't know no it does because it's
[3105.88 → 3110.68] like the meta quest yeah which is horrible yeah I know right you had such a good brand why would
[3110.68 → 3118.44] you just burn it yeah like oculus is such a cool name compared to meta that is just stupid yep can we
[3118.44 → 3124.84] just like can we just trash on this whole metaverse thing for a little bit here sure tell me something
[3124.84 → 3128.84] why do people think it's going to be one thing this has been the most confusing thing for me the entire
[3128.84 → 3134.04] time why why why does anyone think it's me wife one thing and why does every company individually
[3134.04 → 3138.84] think they are going to have sole ownership of the one thing that exists it has made no sense to me
[3138.84 → 3145.88] the entire time here's what I want to know why does anyone think this is new that to have I ever
[3145.88 → 3155.16] talked on the wan show about the palace the palace was a chat room that I used to
[3155.16 → 3161.96] use yeah back in the late 90s early 2000s not many people are going to remember that as far as I can tell
[3163.00 → 3169.80] was the metaverse okay because they here this is what it looked like so rudimentary by today's standards
[3170.52 → 3177.88] you would go into you would go into rooms so you can see here um you can see how many people were in a
[3177.88 → 3184.20] room, and you would have avatars which were actually not a single image so you could actually you could mix and
[3184.20 → 3189.88] match them you could have a like a top middle and bottom and like skater boy avatars were super
[3189.88 → 3195.08] popular at the time I'm sure they were because it was the late 90s and like skater girl avatars kids
[3195.08 → 3200.52] look like uh people traded avatars they had an actual like there was some there was some commerce
[3200.52 → 3206.44] and then there was some commerce around avatars where you could pay people to make them for you
[3206.44 → 3211.16] because the skill of actually creating these avatars at that time was not something that was common
[3211.16 → 3216.60] cool right supporting artists directly um why not let's see if I can find some of those just like
[3217.16 → 3221.56] uh this seems to be more modern it's actually apparently been resurrected so I'm trying to
[3221.56 → 3226.92] find some original stuff this is this looks OG uh because your default was this weird smiley face
[3228.12 → 3232.44] um yeah let me see if I can find any screenshots that actually look like they're from way back than
[3232.44 → 3241.88] but basically you would join a palace and a palace would contain multiple rooms so uh corns uh south
[3241.88 → 3248.28] park had one like it was actually kind of mainstream within certain circles and then different rooms could
[3248.28 → 3254.68] have different themes and the way that the chat worked was you could whisper to people so okay you'd see
[3254.68 → 3259.56] people right next to each other like these two they're probably whispering so nobody else can see what they're
[3259.56 → 3266.92] typing, but you could also communicate openly kind of like this, and you would just have a speech bubble
[3266.92 → 3274.12] that would come up like this is as far as I can tell pretty much the metaverse but like 2d metaverse
[3275.16 → 3282.12] correct me if I'm wrong help me out here there's also like if we want to move past this a little bit
[3282.12 → 3294.76] as well there's uh second life here we go here we go this is it this is palace avatars circa 1999 in a nutshell
[3296.20 → 3303.56] this was basically everything they've got gene code jeans too everyone and their dog was rocking this
[3303.56 → 3310.92] oh I love it and there was a bunch of these right it wasn't just the palace well Hana hotel came later
[3310.92 → 3315.40] I would say Hana hotel was kind of the spiritual success oh I'm not saying there's a bunch that were
[3315.40 → 3319.40] before this, but there was a lot of different like chat room things where you could get different
[3319.40 → 3325.96] avatars and whatnot um and then second life is like legitimately it yeah right like there was you could
[3325.96 → 3331.56] set up businesses there yeah you could build buildings you could do all the normal
[3331.56 → 3336.76] things you'd do in normal life land um, and it was mostly filled with weird people by the end but
[3336.76 → 3343.56] that's okay um no comment there was uh I can tell you the palace definitely had some weird people on it
[3344.12 → 3349.32] anytime you have an anonymized internet chat room thing it's just going to happen there's a lot of ASL
[3349.32 → 3355.96] going around let me say that and I don't mean American sign language yeah that's what I'm talking about
[3355.96 → 3362.68] um I have no idea who I chatted with all those years ago I mean I was smart enough to never meet
[3362.68 → 3371.96] up with anyone in person but I know people that were not okay I shouldn't use the term smart I was
[3372.52 → 3379.88] savvy enough educated sure cautious enough there because smart people can make big mistakes oh
[3379.88 → 3383.16] yeah you want me to tell you about a big mistake I made once or do you want to do are you in the middle
[3383.16 → 3387.96] of a story go ahead uh no I mean not particularly all I was saying is i I know people personally
[3387.96 → 3392.60] that made the mistake of meeting up with people in real life that they only knew online
[3392.60 → 3397.48] especially back then because these days it's a little bit easier you can see with stuff like
[3397.48 → 3404.04] Facebook and webcam conversations you can see people more directly but back then you had no idea
[3404.04 → 3409.80] usually um even now it's very dangerous, and you should be very careful but anyway um yeah second life
[3409.80 → 3414.52] is like legitimately it and is still totally around VR chat a lot of people have positioned
[3414.52 → 3418.76] people have mentioned this in chat and I've seen it previously as well VR chat has been positioned as
[3418.76 → 3426.92] what this thing is um yeah I think right now it's extremely buzzword oh yeah and I think there's
[3426.92 → 3431.88] some internet of things I think there's some savvy business people and tech people that are going to get
[3431.88 → 3438.52] themselves in positions in companies based around work on the metaverse in order to make very large amounts of
[3438.52 → 3444.92] money produce probably nothing and then move on to the next thing that's yeah sorry story of when you
[3444.92 → 3452.36] made a mistake you want to hear about the day I turned into a cynical jaded misanthrope oh my yeah yes
[3452.36 → 3461.48] so I generally believed in the fundamental goodness of people and I was a pretty trusting person
[3461.48 → 3470.52] um until I had a very, very bad experience that really came down to my own naivety okay
[3472.92 → 3480.04] when I was in high school I had someone approach me on the street saying that they were in a bind
[3481.16 → 3487.80] they had a had a check that they needed to cash for whatever reason their bank uh wouldn't do it
[3487.80 → 3493.40] they would endorse it to me and if I could give them like at least most of the cash that it was for
[3494.28 → 3498.36] and it was like a hundred and some dollars or something like that so it was a non-trivial amount
[3498.36 → 3504.60] of money and somehow I let them sweet talk me into cashing a check for them essentially
[3506.76 → 3515.08] I even knew that it was sketchy so i I like I was like okay well i I'm going to take a picture with you
[3515.08 → 3520.04] so that I know who you are and I can report this if you're scamming me here, and they took the
[3520.04 → 3527.00] picture with me and everything but i got talked into going to an atm withdrawing cash handing
[3527.00 → 3534.44] it to someone having them endorse this check putting it in and not only was I obviously out the money
[3534.44 → 3541.64] because yeah it didn't go through but I got charged for trying to cash a bad check and that was when i that
[3541.64 → 3549.40] was when i I realized I was like oh someone can seem totally nice totally chill swear on their
[3549.40 → 3556.36] mother's grave that they are not out to hurt you and stab you right in the face and I was like
[3556.36 → 3563.56] oh okay well this is perfect to know um yeah that's rough yeah yeah, and it was just it was just one
[3563.56 → 3570.12] of those things like i was young I was naive I didn't know better and i i I guess what I'm saying
[3570.12 → 3577.08] is like I understand how people can make mistakes I'm really tech-savvy I've spent my entire life on
[3577.08 → 3585.08] the internet so i I saw some you need the experience to not make a similar or related
[3585.08 → 3591.00] mistake in the future you kind of have to screw up well everyone I feel like I shouldn't say everyone
[3591.00 → 3597.48] because maybe some people just can get wisdom by just knowing from someone else or whatever speaking of
[3597.48 → 3602.52] getting wisdom I just realized we should probably tell people what's happening which merch messages
[3602.52 → 3606.84] right now um oh because we didn't tell them about the replies' thing oh yeah I've been going on this
[3606.84 → 3612.36] whole show oh yeah cool uh well hopefully people noticed that when they send in merch messages a lot
[3612.36 → 3618.12] of the time the reply comes up right with your merch message yeah I would hope people would notice that
[3618.12 → 3625.48] but it looks very similar to a merch message though so anytime you see the LTTE with RGB lights behind it
[3625.48 → 3633.08] that's a reply to the very thing you saw right before it yeah so we have a producer now which
[3633.08 → 3638.76] is fantastic yeah, and he's, and sometimes it might be us so far I think it's pretty much just been the
[3638.76 → 3644.52] producer but uh they have the ability to respond to you because sometimes we've gotten feedback that a lot
[3644.52 → 3647.64] of times we're answering the same question that we've been answering for the last over and over and
[3647.64 → 3653.56] over again um so we're trying to address some of those questions with text now so that it doesn't eat into
[3653.56 → 3661.64] the showtime um it's ski blue asks what do you gain from doing a scam like that you gain my money
[3661.64 → 3667.80] yeah because I gave the guy cash because remember Linus would get a small portion of it yep which
[3667.80 → 3673.00] realistically you probably got a fee for trying to cash a false check, and he had a whole story
[3673.00 → 3680.52] about how he really needed it and his bank uh was closed and what bank did I bank at are they still open
[3680.52 → 3691.00] it was like it was a whole thing it was I just um yeah i uh yeah i I made a mistake right and
[3691.00 → 3699.24] where I was going with that was that recently we did a video where I basically condemned people piling on to
[3699.24 → 3705.00] folks that fall for online scams because we need people to have the confidence to come forward and
[3705.00 → 3710.68] talk about it because that's a big part of how you educate people like you can't you can't just say
[3710.68 → 3715.80] you can't just keep it hush, hush every time you condemn someone for falling for that you're you're
[3715.80 → 3720.68] making sure the scammers win again some other time exactly you're part of the problem at that point so
[3720.68 → 3726.36] we just need to we need to say okay you know hey here's what we could do better next time but try
[3726.36 → 3731.32] not to shame people about it is what I'm what I'm trying to say feel free to shame me my feelings won't be
[3731.32 → 3736.92] hurt but in general you don't everyone's used to just being a public figure and being
[3736.92 → 3740.44] constantly shamed for their horrible hot takes right
[3743.24 → 3748.36] yeah it's true private privateering my my feelings
[3750.36 → 3755.64] uh actually now's uh now's a good time for you to make it up to me uh you can head to ltdstore.com
[3755.64 → 3766.68] uh where we just launched two adorable plushes we've got the controller plushier we've got the
[3766.68 → 3772.12] computer plushier these are based on the same characters from the ABCs of gaming board book
[3772.12 → 3778.44] that Sarah and I worked on together uh I guess oh man I guess it was over a year ago, and we have a
[3778.44 → 3786.36] special promo to run with it if you pick up a plushier with code abc plush you can get an ABCs of
[3786.36 → 3794.12] gaming book for only five bucks so it's a combo deal where you are saving I think that works out to a
[3794.12 → 3800.76] ten dollar saving savings if you pick up the plushier and the book I don't know how long that's running but
[3800.76 → 3805.80] computer monitor not for very long probably because that's a pretty aggressive promo, so thank you for that
[3805.80 → 3816.76] nick um sure why not oh, oh this is cool apparently the first newsletter of the year went out today
[3816.76 → 3822.68] uh shoot I'm not logged into the account that is on the newsletter does it automatically publish to a
[3822.68 → 3828.84] blog yet no oh crap we're working on that we are I mean it probably would have been there Conrad
[3828.84 → 3834.84] wanted to push it and I was like no oh crap wait till Monday uh okay I'm going to try and get logged
[3834.84 → 3837.48] into that account in the meantime do you want to do another topic sure
[3842.52 → 3846.44] or were we in the middle of something had i just I don't remember to be completely honest
[3847.16 → 3853.00] um Facebook losing money did we finish that topic yeah i kind of feel like it uh there was a question
[3853.00 → 3858.60] at the end saying is this a good thing I mean megabook is popular is a popular punching bag but should
[3858.60 → 3867.24] they really crash and burn um a wise take was yes CW's yes that's Colin an s's take was yes that's uh our
[3867.24 → 3877.16] new guy okay what do you think the team is the team is unanimous um it's a complicated question
[3877.16 → 3883.48] because like Facebook losing value uh a publicly traded company so that means people with stocks lose
[3883.48 → 3888.92] value yeah it means real people actually like lost money today i I don't have a decent amount of the
[3888.92 → 3894.28] ownership of Facebook is probably in the hands of people that I'm not very concerned about that's
[3894.28 → 3903.00] fair as well but Facebook also has a lot of retail investors there is probably a lot of uh yeah non-one
[3903.00 → 3907.48] percent or two presenters that have ownership there as well and I'm never rooting for that no
[3907.48 → 3912.76] uh I mean even the one percent I think we need to stop vilifying the one percent quite as much
[3913.64 → 3918.04] because it's it's the okay here hold on a second hold on are you saying we should widen it
[3918.76 → 3924.84] widen it well you can't widen it because it's one percent no scope like should you go beyond one
[3924.84 → 3932.12] no, no no, no no okay so hold on one percent top earners hold on where is it one percent top earners in
[3932.12 → 3940.68] Canada okay so the one percent in Canada is hold on is this household income much lower Canada's lower
[3940.68 → 3945.48] population than California yeah but it's a dollar value, but this is Facebook ownership so
[3945.48 → 3954.04] you'd have to include Americans okay sure okay top one percent earners in U.S. okay so what is that the
[3954.04 → 3959.80] top one percent represents about 1.3 million households who roughly make more than five hundred thousand dollars
[3959.80 → 3966.44] a year okay that's higher than it is in Canada okay that seems like a bit of a problem because
[3966.44 → 3972.12] in Canada I'm not very worried if people who make over 500 grand a year see a loss in Canada we're
[3972.12 → 3978.84] talking 320 000 Canadian so that's a that's like under a quarter million U.S. a year so you're talking
[3978.84 → 3982.92] like potentially like a neurosurgeon or something like that you're not talking someone who's just
[3983.56 → 3989.32] making money through flexing their money these are people that conceivably are actually
[3990.36 → 3996.92] working it depends uh day to day not all of them but I'm saying what I'm trying to say is I don't
[3996.92 → 4004.44] think neurosurgeon person who has to pay off their immense student debt and might have Facebook
[4004.44 → 4011.96] shares yeah I don't wish that sure stuff goes down I think a huge percentage of people that are in that
[4011.96 → 4017.32] section that are not neurosurgeons and maybe inherited a bunch of wealth or whatever else well that's not
[4017.32 → 4023.72] earnings though so you are okay because there's two there are two different ways of measuring the one
[4023.72 → 4029.80] percent okay yeah right because you can either measure it by income and there are actual working
[4029.80 → 4034.28] people that make a quarter million dollars a year because they just happen to be like really
[4034.28 → 4039.16] good at something specialized I have no problem with that whatsoever yeah but once you get into we're
[4039.16 → 4045.16] not saying whether we have a problem with it, we're saying if we uh feel bad because Facebook
[4045.16 → 4051.72] stock this is a weird conversation we're saying uh if we feel bad because they lost money or value or
[4051.72 → 4058.68] whatever um because Facebook stock went down sure I guess what I'm trying to say is
[4060.36 → 4067.00] I feel bad because not every investor in Facebook is some kind of cartoon villain yeah
[4067.56 → 4072.20] there's retail investors certain that there are people that are invested in Facebook
[4072.20 → 4077.72] that are grinding super hard in very, very low paid jobs sure I've been saving everything they
[4077.72 → 4081.80] possibly can to try to get into the stock market because that's what a lot of people tell you to do
[4081.80 → 4085.16] and they're trying to dig themselves out of whatever they can by doing that type of stuff
[4085.16 → 4089.48] and they might be invested in Facebook, and they might have just lost a lot of potential money and
[4089.48 → 4094.20] that could be very damaging unfortunate I think that is probably few and far between and to be
[4094.20 → 4100.12] clear I'm not saying that someone in the top one percent in Canada is somehow a pauper right I'm not
[4100.12 → 4107.48] saying that they're living in poverty I'm saying that compared to the 0.1 percent which averaged apparently
[4107.48 → 4115.64] 1.7 million dollars in 2018 um they are relatively speaking probably actually spending a significant
[4115.64 → 4119.48] amount of that money putting it back into circulation because hoarding is the problem
[4120.44 → 4126.44] if the top 0.1 percent if the top earners were actually spending all of it because that's something
[4126.44 → 4131.64] that gets talked about a lot of people who want to defend the wealthy they'll say well you know
[4131.64 → 4141.40] they they they trickle-down economics they create jobs Reagan they only create jobs if they spend the
[4141.40 → 4148.92] money on jobs that's that's the only way if they're is they're buying more art if they're using more
[4148.92 → 4155.40] services if they're is they're going out, and it's spending a lot of money tipping a thousand dollars sure or
[4155.40 → 4162.60] whatever if they're actually spending it then it's not really a problem that they're earning an insane
[4162.60 → 4168.12] amount of money, but you can't control what people do with their money but at a certain point you reach
[4168.12 → 4176.20] you reach a level where you can't really spend that kind of money like it's not it's not hard time it's
[4176.20 → 4183.16] not practical, and it just becomes this like penis measuring contest um so I guess what I'm saying is
[4183.16 → 4188.92] that compared to the one percent who conceivably are actually spending that kind of money on a yearly
[4188.92 → 4195.48] basis live indefinitely that good life like I'm not I'm not saying i I feel bad for them necessarily
[4195.48 → 4200.52] but I'm also not saying that I don't think they're villains I think that the 0.1 percent especially if
[4200.52 → 4205.96] they're not spending it are a much, much bigger problem because I think speaking from personal
[4205.96 → 4210.44] experience I think spending one and a half million dollars a year would be extremely difficult
[4210.44 → 4217.08] like extremely difficult tell me how to do it on something other than Vancouver real estate
[4217.96 → 4221.40] because I knew that was coming you don't have enough money if it's Vancouver real estate yeah
[4221.40 → 4228.60] fair enough you need more come on pump it up that's your down payment boys yeah um yeah no i i i
[4229.80 → 4235.88] my brain doesn't really go there but what I'm sure I'm sure Mr beast could find a way well, but that's it
[4235.88 → 4242.12] he's spending it on his business he's employing people yeah that's fine oh, oh to be clear I spend
[4242.12 → 4247.80] a lot more than a million half dollars a year on employing people our payroll here oh monstrous
[4249.80 → 4257.16] I would not be surprised and this is going to be terrifying I would not be surprised if in 2023 2024
[4257.16 → 4260.36] by the time we hit that time frame if our payroll cracks
[4265.72 → 4266.36] eight figures
[4268.52 → 4272.84] I would not be surprised I'm like really getting close to finalizing some of my positions and even
[4272.84 → 4277.48] though the rest are not I think I'm just going to have to pull triggers on some of them because like
[4277.48 → 4286.04] I don't want to drag people along for so long um and yep that's all I have to say um developers
[4286.04 → 4290.44] are expensive we're we're hiring more people in that realm we're hiring more engineers we're hiring
[4290.44 → 4295.96] more stuff like that that's all very expensive roles very expensive roles this is interesting guys
[4295.96 → 4303.48] this is a terrible take um it has begun openly complaining about paying people did I complain
[4303.48 → 4310.28] no he's not you did not complain I said I do I said that spending a million and a half dollars is
[4310.28 → 4318.12] really easy when you employ a gigantic team of people, but that's not what i asked you to
[4318.12 → 4323.00] try to spend it personally in your community and stuff like that yeah yeah I don't know i
[4323.00 → 4327.08] mean you could go to a movie every day, and you wouldn't even get close uh like you couldn't okay what
[4327.08 → 4331.00] does that work out to here hold on let's do the math let's do the math this is fun
[4331.00 → 4344.04] a million and a half dollars okay divided by 365 is 4 109 a day okay so you're only you can only be
[4344.04 → 4351.80] awake for let's say 16 hours a day right you let's say you sleep okay so divided by 16 means that you
[4351.80 → 4359.16] are making 256 an hour not for being at work just for existing for being conscious yeah you're making
[4359.16 → 4369.24] 256 an hour okay divided by 60 you're making four dollars and two cents a minute so what that means
[4369.24 → 4374.92] is that like you said are we counting things like rent and stuff no right going to a movie okay
[4374.92 → 4381.64] Luke going to a movie hold on going to a movie which takes about two hours right two and a
[4381.64 → 4387.08] half hours yeah sure so what's that work out to about a hundred and let's say 160 minutes okay you buy
[4387.08 → 4394.76] some popcorn 160 you would have to spend 684 on that movie experience in order to come out
[4396.04 → 4400.68] with less money than you walked in hopefully that's that popcorn's got some of that like gold
[4400.68 → 4407.40] filigree on top of it or something so no Luke tell me how to spend money faster what did I
[4407.40 → 4412.76] divide by 160 okay hold on tell me how to spend money faster than four dollars a minute I think this
[4412.76 → 4419.48] is it just naturally and paintball the same okay you could if you can walk your trigger right you
[4419.48 → 4424.44] can go to the paintball field you buy paint at the field okay super marked up paint you go like this
[4425.08 → 4430.04] okay you are spending money faster than you make it giving me give me one other activity really buff
[4430.04 → 4435.56] fingers like even stuff you can't let up even extreme activities right like skydiving well you could
[4435.56 → 4444.28] you scuba diving you can only do them so often you cannot conceivably spend even a flight okay you
[4444.28 → 4450.84] go to a tropical location you're flying for 10 hours okay what's 10 hours work out to 600 minutes okay so
[4450.84 → 4458.52] times 600 they're 2500 you literally made more sitting on the plane than it cost you to fly to Mexico I think
[4458.52 → 4465.40] a lot of people solve this problem if you want to show it that by buying property but then that problem
[4465.40 → 4469.24] that's investment just goes that's not spending money no I know that's what I'm saying, but that's
[4469.24 → 4474.12] that movie called Brewster's millions I think it's called there's this bad movie from the 80s where this
[4474.12 → 4483.72] guy gets an uh, uh an inheritance but the rich uh the rich benefactor has this these strings attached
[4483.72 → 4491.64] where in order to get the big inheritance they have to spend the small inheritance without um retaining
[4491.64 → 4497.32] any meaningful assets at the end of it and I think the idea is that they like to have to get it out of
[4497.32 → 4502.52] their system okay or something like that and the I'm giving away the plot it's kind of a crap movie
[4502.52 → 4508.92] anyway so it doesn't really matter but spoiler alert he ends up running for office and then trying to
[4508.92 → 4516.92] lose because if he wins then he would have a would have actually gained terrible plan yeah whatever
[4516.92 → 4521.88] that's why the movie sucks um they should just come up with they should have just made a movie
[4521.88 → 4526.12] of some guy who shoots paintball constantly golden plated paintball you know what twitch chat
[4526.12 → 4532.04] apparently likes the movie I enjoyed it but I watched it when I was a literal child so and
[4532.04 → 4538.28] I've heard it's like a bad movie so just take all this for the ignorant rambling that it is
[4539.48 → 4545.16] NFTs easy people would argue that those are investments yeah people would argue that those are
[4545.16 → 4551.88] investments so come on hit me i I don't know i this isn't me you can't yeah you actually cannot i uh
[4551.88 → 4558.04] you could live that jet set life and not be able to spend that kind of money yeah I could, I don't I
[4558.04 → 4564.84] yeah it would be a job for cocaine says the spunky I don't know how much cocaine costs but I would
[4564.84 → 4572.12] I would hazard consume safely I would hazard a guess that you actually could not consume enough cocaine
[4572.12 → 4578.68] to overcome that kind of income could you consume four thousand dollars worth of cocaine in a day i
[4578.68 → 4585.48] legitimately have no idea what cocaine costs no clue okay yeah float plane chat hookers and blow okay all
[4585.48 → 4593.40] right okay my understanding is that ladies of the evening actually are quite expensive but i literally
[4593.40 → 4601.08] cannot speak to that from personal experience i yeah I don't know it would be to be clear not shaming
[4601.08 → 4608.20] sex work is work I just want to make that very, very clear i just I really should cost a lot I'm married
[4608.20 → 4617.00] yeah so i and I'm not okay I'm not kink shaming if you and your married partner are into it hey cool
[4617.00 → 4621.96] oh man how do I back my how do I get myself out of this corner you personally are in a monogamous
[4621.96 → 4629.40] relationship yes got it we got him but yeah I don't know for me this would actually be like a
[4629.40 → 4640.28] difficult job Luke monogamous there are carved outs yeah um yeah this would be a very difficult job
[4640.28 → 4647.56] not that you know no problems there but spending that much money that fast would be people
[4647.56 → 4651.96] are like throw banging parties fair enough, but you're not going to throw a party every day of
[4651.96 → 4657.48] the week some people try I think don't they wasn't that like a wasn't like socialite
[4657.48 → 4666.84] culture basically that yeah I mean I guess so I just yacht parties buy a yacht buying a yacht yes
[4666.84 → 4671.64] that's a popular one is that an investment you see this not buying supercars is like sort of
[4671.64 → 4677.24] investment yeah especially if they're limited edition that can apparently be a perfect investment so is
[4677.24 → 4682.12] is buying a yacht an investment does that have that same thing going on I'm not I think yachts
[4682.12 → 4687.88] depreciate I have no idea i I honestly don't know you see Bezos is having them like to tear down a
[4688.60 → 4694.76] historic bridge yeah to like to float his yacht out to the ocean or something like that we don't actually
[4694.76 → 4701.88] know for sure that it's Bezos, but it's rumoured to be Bezos say no just leave it there good luck
[4701.88 → 4711.88] hope you like floating in the river oh man yeah invest in meta that's an investment yeah yeah it's
[4711.88 → 4719.48] an investment I'm talking actually spending it yeah it's it would be hard it would be legitimately hard
[4719.48 → 4724.76] to be fair the scenario where they have to actually spend that amount just doesn't really exist because
[4724.76 → 4728.36] what's going to be coming out of that money is your mortgage or your rent or whatever
[4728.36 → 4732.76] um I don't think you have a mortgage if you're paying if you're making a million and a half
[4732.76 → 4741.96] dollars a year I mean you could what if your house is 30 million dollars okay that ah see this is where
[4741.96 → 4750.20] you and i I feel like have trouble with these kinds of conversations because um I have always and I know
[4750.20 → 4757.40] you have always been um a life within my means kind of person when Ivan oh no so I agree if I was
[4757.40 → 4763.80] making that much I would not have a mortgage yeah but I'm sure people do is all I'm yeah I mean
[4763.80 → 4771.16] I know there are houses that cost that kind of money it's just i i i no matter I would have to have
[4771.88 → 4778.12] 30 million dollars in the bank to actually maybe not 30 million because I'm thinking back to when
[4778.12 → 4782.28] Ivan and I bought our house we were approved for a mortgage that was either double or triple or something
[4782.28 → 4787.32] like that what we ultimately spent on our home and that was back 11 years ago or 12 years ago
[4787.32 → 4795.08] almost now, and we didn't do it because we were just totally uncomfortable with that level of debt
[4795.08 → 4803.40] so I guess what it would work out to now because we did 20 down is I would have to have six million down
[4803.40 → 4809.96] and I would have to expect to have I would have to expect to be able to pay it off within about five to
[4809.96 → 4816.20] seven years five to eight years I think was our goal I think we had wanted we had set the stretch
[4816.20 → 4822.44] goal of like uh five assuming that everything went amazing and I like crushed it and actually I don't
[4822.44 → 4827.00] even think that was no I don't even think that was a dream yet at the point that we were actually buying
[4827.00 → 4832.36] it I think that came later when we were like we should start a company and stuff like that so I'm
[4832.36 → 4836.60] trying to I'm trying to think back to the timeline your house yeah you had I think 10 years I think
[4836.60 → 4843.72] 10 years was mortgage shredding goal with a stretch target of beating it, and we were not willing to
[4843.72 → 4849.00] take on a mortgage payment that we couldn't comfortably pay double every month, so our mortgage was actually
[4849.72 → 4854.20] um half of the payments that we made, and then we made sure that we had an agreement with the bank
[4854.20 → 4859.24] where we could pay twice as much because that second that first payment is almost all interest yeah and
[4859.24 → 4865.24] that second payment is all principle the way that are the way that our mortgage worked anyway um
[4867.64 → 4873.80] where was I going with this right so even if I made like that that kind of money i I would have to
[4873.80 → 4878.84] have I'm not 30 million dollar house I don't see the point how many people would have to live in it
[4879.40 → 4885.72] to make any sense like basically small hotels like they're they're insane yeah i I don't know but then
[4885.72 → 4890.28] you hear about these like uh and I know this isn't necessarily the scenario we're talking about
[4890.28 → 4895.56] but we're so off-topic right now yeah funny so who cares uh but you constantly hear about sports
[4895.56 → 4902.84] stars that just make huge money many million dollars a year contracts like just big big big money and
[4902.84 → 4908.20] then they're out they're retired for like two three years, and they're broke yeah so like
[4909.88 → 4914.44] I don't know I think one of the things is when you start making that type of money people will try
[4914.44 → 4922.28] to float into your life that will you know find ways for you to spend it um that's fair so yeah i
[4922.28 → 4928.68] don't know uh people are saying no, no they're talking about theoretical 30 million dollar homes oh ladies
[4928.68 → 4936.76] and gentlemen we are not talking theoretical homes we are talking we live in Vancouver ladies and gentlemen
[4936.76 → 4948.52] literally the least affordable city on earth ladies and gentlemen here it is 33 990 got a few more zeros
[4948.52 → 4958.92] after that 1233 Tecumseh avenue oh yeah nice looking place nice looking place and I ain't talking I ain't
[4958.92 → 4966.52] talking some estate here ladies and gentlemen this is probably on like a half acre hold on a second what is it
[4966.52 → 4977.00] yeah half acre lot he's nailed it oh Lord it's only a 1200 wait what is this a 1200 square foot
[4977.00 → 4982.52] household on i I've lost track is that a lot oh that's a lot yeah yeah that's a lot sorry there's
[4982.52 → 4990.52] an extra zero in here because my current place is uh 2200 and I thought this was less I thought it was
[4990.52 → 4998.52] I thought it was 1200 it is 12 000 square feet yeah i i totally served there uh oh shoot
[4998.52 → 5003.88] I just unplugged my headphones for monitoring that oh I need a phone plane chat saying California and Vegas
[5003.88 → 5008.84] have those 30 million plus dollar homes yeah New York like there's their definitely around the world
[5010.12 → 5015.00] Vancouver overall I think we're still in the lead though for most unaffordable city on earth
[5015.00 → 5021.24] probably um roughly we don't technically live in Vancouver that's a that's always a nice little
[5021.24 → 5027.40] thing obviously we feel it out here brutally, but it's not quite as bad as it is in Vancouver proper
[5027.40 → 5033.48] hold on a second I know that like there's some Australian Sydney oh we're number two we're number
[5033.48 → 5036.44] two behind Hong Kong what is that article from this is from
[5036.44 → 5045.16] December 2021 this is recent with that said Hong Kong there's apparently an exodus going
[5045.16 → 5049.88] on there right now because of the uh crackdowns and everything else so
[5050.60 → 5057.88] maybe the situation will change there, and we can be back on top yay yeah we're the best at being the
[5057.88 → 5067.32] the worst sweet yeah um crazy though right yeah I don't remember where we were going with this
[5067.32 → 5072.84] buying multiple houses that's a big one and renovations I can speak from experience renovations
[5072.84 → 5079.32] can be a really, really good way to spend an insane amount of money that you will never get a return on
[5079.32 → 5085.32] oh yeah um the builder upgrading your car the builder we were talking to was uh telling us actually I think
[5085.32 → 5091.00] it was the ones who did the uh the boiler system were telling us about a place that they did uh I believe
[5091.00 → 5100.92] it was up in whistler for an athlete that apparently had on tap beer like plumbed into the house
[5101.96 → 5110.28] so not just like in a bar but like there were beer taps like everywhere like if you can dream it
[5110.28 → 5118.20] there are boutique home builders that can build it for you yeah and I was like what my uncle has
[5118.20 → 5124.92] has done some just absolutely incredible builds um and like they pride themselves on really high
[5124.92 → 5129.40] quality and all this kind of stuff and like I can appreciate the craftsmanship but some of the costs
[5129.40 → 5135.16] of the houses and stuff that they build they're just like what the even who how did they even possibly
[5135.16 → 5143.16] make this much money like i just oh man I don't know yeah flipped a mattress says how the f do you
[5143.16 → 5147.80] keep it cold well remember I did say that the company that was talking about this was the one
[5147.80 → 5153.96] that did the boiler system for our uh for our house it's just in floor heat there's no beer taps okay
[5154.60 → 5159.40] um so that I'm sure they have experience with heating and cooling and all that kind of stuff isn't that
[5159.40 → 5166.60] crazy though that is absolutely nuts oh I love it I love it um apparently one of the uh one of the tech
[5166.60 → 5174.84] giant uh executives also has a place up there that has snow melts across like hundreds I think they said
[5174.84 → 5182.04] thousands of square feet of outside area so it just has these like banks of boilers that just sit
[5182.04 → 5189.16] and burn fuel to keep snow off of the patio and off of the driveway for the like three days a year that
[5189.16 → 5199.48] they actually go there like just mind-bending stuff guys mind-bending, although they spent money
[5200.28 → 5205.40] at least they spent at least they spent it on something yeah at least those trades got work
[5205.40 → 5210.68] yeah, and we're doing stuff yep that's fair enough yep oh no Jaden's gone full eat the rich
[5210.68 → 5221.16] fair enough but like I've said to David on many occasions here please don't eat me I like to feel
[5221.16 → 5228.60] like I'm I haven't gone full filthy capitalist where I actually like work every day for my money okay can
[5228.60 → 5235.08] can we can you get behind that are you going to eat me uh no I'm good Jeff bell you're going to eat me
[5235.08 → 5242.76] he's giving me he's giving me after all the scraps that I let fall off my table for you
[5244.20 → 5252.12] I got oh my god I called him Jeff instead of Jake I always call him bell I totally called him Jeff
[5252.92 → 5258.12] oh man you're screwed man that was terrible well yeah I don't I don't blame you I mean I had your last
[5258.12 → 5268.84] name right jeff oh on that horrible note um thanks for your painstakingly spent all this time
[5268.84 → 5273.96] thanks for your hard work Jake going through all the merch messages and curating them for us why
[5273.96 → 5280.52] don't we why don't we do some of them so you can actually go home at some point here oh man oh no oh
[5280.52 → 5287.16] no the chat's full of eat the rich oh no come on guys come on no for real I'm making new investments
[5287.16 → 5291.72] into the company we're hiring way more people I swear to you, I'm spending that's true labs think
[5291.72 → 5298.92] of labs think of LTT labs think of all the new people we're hiring for LTT store oh man yummy Linus
[5298.92 → 5304.68] burger all right lets uh let's do some merch messages here please spend money don't eat me
[5306.12 → 5313.56] I swear it supports so many people uh all right curated ones uh I know running a permanent open air
[5313.56 → 5317.80] test bench setup is not commonly recommended but I've been doing it for five years these are coming
[5317.80 → 5322.28] in so fast that it completely shifted off my screen I've been doing it five years now without
[5322.28 → 5327.32] issues I think besides dust and dander what problems would I look out for airflow no
[5327.32 → 5333.00] airflow will be as good as anything the only way you could have bad airflow is if you didn't
[5333.00 → 5339.56] really have any fans at all and that that heat pocket is allowed to just kind of sit there
[5339.56 → 5345.80] stagnant or anything going on yeah that's so if you're trying to run a passive computer you might
[5345.80 → 5351.72] want to don't assume that an open bench means that magically you get magic airflow through it or
[5351.72 → 5357.88] something like that you might still need a one slow fan just circulating air in the room that was
[5357.88 → 5363.48] something that we saw with the hp omen 45l was that depending on where we put our temp sensors in the
[5363.48 → 5368.84] room it actually heats up a pocket near it and that's normal so that's the only thing that I would be
[5368.84 → 5372.28] aware of and making sure that you blow it off once in a while that's that's it, it's probably
[5372.28 → 5377.88] more not recommended because like stuff might fall into a fan, or you might spill a drink on it more
[5377.88 → 5381.32] easily or whatever yeah but if you put a grill on it something like that it's not a problem I've been
[5381.32 → 5387.72] benched my systems for a long time all right Nicholas says hey Linus and Luke I just built my second pc
[5388.52 → 5395.00] and I plan to use it as a server slash home theatre pc I installed Debian and virtualized windows for VR
[5395.00 → 5402.60] gaming I don't know if I'd recommend that for the best like low latency experience but if you're
[5402.60 → 5407.40] happy with it then I'm happy for you yeah I planned on setting up next cloud for file storage but what
[5407.40 → 5412.92] other software improves daily life that you host on your own hardware I mean Plex is really the heaviest
[5412.92 → 5418.28] one for me, I was going to say Plex yeah Plex is awesome, but it sounds like you're already using it as
[5418.28 → 5423.64] a server slash home theatre so I'm assuming you thought of Plex um one of the other things that
[5423.64 → 5430.04] will be running on mine at the new place is home assistant so it's so that's that's whoa i just
[5430.04 → 5434.28] lost my headphones that's home automation stuff yes yeah that's direction I was going to go, and it ties
[5434.28 → 5441.64] in all the disparate ecosystems that don't otherwise talk to each other it's super cool those I'd say are
[5441.64 → 5451.08] are the pretty big ones for me uh Erin a what is your opinion on the 8 gig Rx 580 does it still hold
[5451.08 → 5457.48] up uh in today's games or should I look into 3060 when they're available well if you've got one you
[5457.48 → 5462.44] are the only one who can answer that question because I feel like being compelled to upgrade by
[5462.44 → 5468.76] the availability of some new widget is a mistake that's that's meaningless yeah yeah the only times i
[5468.76 → 5474.84] usually look towards upgrading my hardware is if there's an if there's an issue with the performance
[5474.84 → 5479.80] that I'm getting whether a game that i currently play has updated and has become more difficult to
[5479.80 → 5485.96] run exactly or if I'm trying to play a new game and I can't have it run at an acceptable frame rate no
[5485.96 → 5493.00] I don't have a disadvantage or yeah I don't expect everything to run at like uh at maximum like 144 hertz
[5493.00 → 5499.64] refreshing ultra settings all the time and like as I keep the same computer as new games come out
[5499.64 → 5504.84] maybe I'll lower my like average settings per game for a little while but then eventually it'll become
[5504.84 → 5508.76] at a level where it's unsatisfaction it's nice having a brand-new rig and running everything at high but
[5508.76 → 5513.48] it's not necessary we did a video about that a while ago about how ultra settings really don't
[5513.48 → 5520.84] look very different when you are engaged in the game sure if you pixel peep if you pixel peep you
[5520.84 → 5525.48] can find it you can yeah you can find it, but you have to be real with yourself about whether it
[5525.48 → 5531.24] even matters 100 and a lot of times it doesn't really i really, really like games where when you're
[5531.24 → 5537.56] changing settings there's a little example mm-hmm, and it shows like what it will how it will look
[5537.56 → 5542.60] different based on that setting change and that yeah I've seen so few like that though oh it's
[5542.60 → 5547.56] extremely rare, but it's really nice when they do it Luke d I'm currently saving to build a new
[5547.56 → 5551.00] computer in about a year or so how do you personally design your system's airflow there's
[5551.00 → 5555.16] a lot of overwhelming and conflicting information maybe a job for labs this is absolutely something
[5555.16 → 5559.16] we'll investigate with labs, but there's two main principles one is that you want a little bit
[5559.16 → 5563.56] more air coming in than going out you want to maintain positive pressure inside your system
[5563.56 → 5569.88] and you want those intakes to be filtered which remember will affect how much air is drawn through
[5569.88 → 5574.84] them so you might need three fans coming in two fans going out, and the other is making sure that
[5574.84 → 5580.20] you are actually delivering fresh air to the areas that need it so we showed recently in a video how
[5580.20 → 5586.60] if we had a big changes GPU and a fan blowing across it like this but it kind of blocked off the
[5586.60 → 5592.76] bottom part of the case and there was no way for the fans uh for the heat sink of the GPU to get
[5592.76 → 5597.32] the air that's going constantly being recirculated back into it out of the case you could end up
[5597.32 → 5603.00] with a problem so i would just recommend making sure that for every heat generating component
[5603.00 → 5608.36] which is predominantly your CPU and your GPU you have a clear path for the air to take in with the
[5608.36 → 5617.48] fresh out with the less fresh anonymous says let's hear a random fact that you know about each other
[5618.04 → 5619.72] love the content keep it up
[5622.76 → 5632.12] I know that Luke lived for the better part of two years on nothing but sous vide chicken breast
[5632.92 → 5633.16] yeah
[5635.88 → 5641.24] yep so we chicken breast rice and broccoli that was the that was the meal yeah
[5642.28 → 5646.20] what do you get I know you really like pickles that was the first thing that came to mind
[5646.20 → 5652.68] I don't know like I don't know we both went food yeah interesting I think uh yeah it's
[5652.68 → 5657.88] 6 50 we're both late for dinner it makes sense yeah that actually makes a lot of sense
[5659.40 → 5666.92] um oh and I see what's happening I'm pushing them back up to the okay yeah I need to hit archive
[5666.92 → 5673.24] um Venusian says first time Ltd store buyer also watching on float plane for the first time any chance
[5673.24 → 5679.32] for motorcycle content in the near future I want to leave that to the folks that are just experts at
[5679.32 → 5685.88] it i I love my bike and I ride my bike but i I don't have track experience I don't I don't know about
[5685.88 → 5690.92] all the different you know kinds of suspension you can get and tuning and all that kind of stuff so
[5690.92 → 5696.44] I feel like with motorcycles I just don't have as much to contribute at least until they get a little
[5696.44 → 5702.76] bit more computer on two wheels which will happen you know like i I feel like I could review a heads
[5702.76 → 5709.00] up display for example but I also feel like in that space a lot of the features that might be built into
[5709.00 → 5714.60] a product like that might be very race oriented features so it's hard for me to say there's a lot
[5714.60 → 5720.92] of comments about the chicken rice and broccoli things someone said I remember Luke from a really
[5720.92 → 5726.36] old channel super fun video really just ate an entire head of broccoli yeah I don't know um don't
[5726.36 → 5733.16] take diet advice from random tech people on the internet yeah that would be not best so don't
[5733.16 → 5737.88] uh don't take any of that as suggestion please let's keep going uh yes Ben we are working on a
[5737.88 → 5744.12] water bottle lid with a straw mechanism it's a matter of time um grant what do you think about 3d printed
[5744.12 → 5750.28] residential and commercial construction for example extruded concrete sounds so cool definitely a lot of
[5750.28 → 5755.16] logistical issues to solve because when you're talking construction like this didn't even occur to me
[5755.16 → 5764.36] but intel this video is not up, yet there are a lot of potential issues but i think the tech is
[5764.36 → 5769.08] super, super cool and I think a lot of construction is going to go in that direction eventually I think
[5769.08 → 5774.84] there are still a lot of hurdles to solve because right now um like okay use it for foundation or whatever
[5774.84 → 5780.36] I've seen examples where they essentially print the whole darn house like walls and everything and
[5780.36 → 5787.16] that's sweet wiring and stuff becomes really right interesting um and they like pre-lay things
[5787.16 → 5791.96] for windows and all this kind of stuff, but it's there are unique complications with that construction
[5791.96 → 5796.60] style I'm sure there's people that know significantly more about it than me um but maybe look into it and
[5796.60 → 5802.04] I'm sure there's a lot more like r d that needs to happen to it um, but automation is
[5803.80 → 5808.28] is a big deal, and it's going to come to every industry including that one um and I think that's one of the
[5808.28 → 5813.56] the ways that it's going to come to construction I had an email from valve and I was like we didn't
[5813.56 → 5819.40] do anything bad when we showed the steam deck that we know it's all good that's good telling me about
[5819.40 → 5828.68] some stuff I said nothing trust me um kernel says do you think a new mainstream CPU manufacturer will
[5828.68 → 5838.60] even be possible well apple I would have said no and then apple did it I consider apple sort of
[5838.60 → 5844.68] manufacturer yes that they're made by TSMC or Samsung or whatever, but they are they top to bottom have
[5845.32 → 5853.40] not quite top to bottom okay it's arm based but they they have made a new CPU essentially um
[5853.40 → 5857.80] and I would have said that couldn't be done, but then they did it, and then you've got Amazon with their
[5857.80 → 5863.40] graviton or whatever they call it, but that's not mainstream apple I would argue is mainstream
[5864.20 → 5872.84] man hard to say I'm rooting for risk 5 but there's just so much legacy x86 code out there that we still
[5872.84 → 5878.12] got to run, but then apple showed it might be possible to emulate in a performant way
[5879.64 → 5883.88] i I'm afraid to I'm afraid to even try to look into my crystal ball on that one to be honest with you
[5883.88 → 5890.84] uh Justin asks have you seen the corridor with digital website and have you ever thought to
[5890.84 → 5894.44] implement anything like their point system into float plane that way subscribers could choose what
[5894.44 → 5899.72] content or products their sub money gets allocated to so the reason that we haven't done anything like
[5899.72 → 5906.52] that is because i um i I'm a control freak I like to maintain control of our editorial direction I like
[5906.52 → 5912.36] the writing team to come up with what we want to do and as much as we know love to hear from you
[5912.36 → 5919.32] guys, and we take comments and suggestions I don't want to be beholden to you guys it's also much
[5919.32 → 5924.36] different content yeah I don't want people to feel ripped off because we didn't cover the product that
[5924.36 → 5928.12] they want us to this like motherboard they really wanted us to review well to be fair this isn't a
[5928.12 → 5934.12] suggestion box it's a voting thing yeah so you would come up with the topics yeah but what if one what is
[5934.12 → 5937.96] one of them was an a and the rest of them were kind of b's and I was really hoping they voted for
[5937.96 → 5945.16] the like i just yeah it's tough I don't think we're going to be doing that anytime soon uh Evelyn
[5945.16 → 5949.08] are you expecting the price of steam deck competitors to come down significantly when the deck releases
[5949.08 → 5956.76] like the ionic for example no I'm not no, no the steam deck is inexpensive because valve it went really
[5956.76 → 5963.56] aggressive hyper aggressive on it that's the answer man the people who are complaining about the steam deck
[5963.56 → 5968.92] price when it launched I'm like guys this is a laptop with a game controller built into it, you and
[5968.92 → 5975.72] i both massively went in on how cheap it was actually yes and i I still back that up very much
[5975.72 → 5982.20] so Joshua says hey Luke I've heard you and Linus talk about how frugal you can be frugal's such a nice
[5982.76 → 5990.12] soft word for it is there any kind of technology or whatever that you like to splurge on yeah I mean i
[5990.12 → 5998.44] instantly bought the steam deck oh okay um and VR i had basically I had I think literally
[5998.44 → 6006.76] every single oculus prototype you could acquire for me, it's yeah it's just gaming pcs that's
[6006.76 → 6013.24] that's kind of it i oh oh oh headphones are a guilty pleasure time you bought a gaming pc
[6013.24 → 6019.32] well I'm talking about when I spent money okay yeah yeah but okay so yeah my computer but I have
[6019.32 → 6027.48] literally never purchased a cell phone not once I got my first cell phone from my parents
[6028.04 → 6034.60] and then when it died I inherited one from my than girlfriend who had gotten a new one and then when i
[6034.60 → 6042.68] went to work at NCI they issued me a blackberry then my contract uh allowed for uh like a and I gave
[6042.68 → 6048.84] me an allowance for a new phone and NCI purchased me an iPhone 4 which by the time I left NCI was
[6048.84 → 6056.04] irrelevant, and they didn't care to have it back and then after that HTC sent me a Windows phone
[6056.04 → 6060.84] which I then did an I switched thing to i took my sim out of my iPhone I put it into my Windows phone
[6060.84 → 6066.44] and we got into reviewing phones and the rest is history we now have a bin of phones so I would not
[6066.44 → 6071.24] buy a phone today yeah I have never purchased a cell phone I have never purchased a television
[6071.24 → 6077.64] so those are things that I'd certainly enjoy but are not ones that I have allocated my personal
[6077.64 → 6084.12] funding to but I did blow a bunch of money on a receiver and nice speakers I did blow a bunch of
[6084.12 → 6090.68] money on expensive headphones back in the day I would still do that I'm considering treating myself to
[6090.68 → 6099.08] a pair of Sennheiser items um I'm just I'm AirPods pros are nice, but they just don't sound the same
[6100.28 → 6106.92] yeah a lot of my stuff like back when I used to have to buy it my computer was always good it was
[6107.96 → 6114.60] it was never like crazy i never went way too nuts, but it was always good i almost always
[6114.60 → 6119.96] bought secondhand even when I did splurge yeah i would do things like the intel retail edge stuff
[6119.96 → 6126.04] i would do things like um hey I'll build your computer for you but I mean we're going to throw
[6126.04 → 6131.24] in like a couple extra fans I'm going to take those um yeah or whatever thanks for the fans yeah I would
[6131.24 → 6136.92] like to build people's computers or whatever in order to gain some extra part or if they had something cool
[6136.92 → 6141.96] in their previous one or something I would take that or whatever um obviously they knew every time yes
[6141.96 → 6151.00] obviously um outside that um experiences I guess is my other technology no, but they didn't ask for
[6151.00 → 6155.32] that yeah they did is there any other kind of technology or whatever oh, oh sure sure sure yeah
[6155.32 → 6163.32] okay yeah experiences is definitely a thing um like something I really enjoyed doing in Taiwan was this like
[6164.12 → 6170.20] craze called river tracing yeah um and I had to i had to essentially hire a guide for the whole day to go with
[6170.20 → 6179.40] me and i I hiked up a river up a mountain essentially in the river it was super cool um and when we were
[6179.40 → 6185.88] when we went on the company trip to Mexico I like did some of my own excursion things in addition to the
[6185.88 → 6193.80] company ones um I love that type of stuff I'm super into that yeah thoughts on high-end portable audio
[6193.80 → 6201.56] players gotta say I'm not uh I don't get it for me the phone is good enough and sure yeah fine the
[6202.44 → 6210.76] DAC sucks and whatever else but um for me, we've it's at that point of diminishing returns um especially
[6210.76 → 6218.84] for the amount of attention that I'm giving it when I'm listening on my phone i I mean in my life I don't
[6218.84 → 6226.44] have time to sit and listen to music almost always I'm doing something else I'm playing a game or I'm
[6226.44 → 6233.56] writing a script or I like I'm always doing something and so for the amount of attention
[6233.56 → 6241.96] that I'm giving it is just doesn't make a difference for me uh okay hey Linus after the vault recovery
[6241.96 → 6246.68] series is over would you guys make a proper tutorial on how to set up true Nazi with raid z2 and multiple v devs
[6246.68 → 6250.76] for beginners who have multiple hard drives lying around uh yeah honestly if you just have multiple
[6250.76 → 6254.60] hard drives lying around though you may want to consider unpaid instead the performance is not the
[6254.60 → 6261.16] same as true Nazi, but it's way more flexible and for home use it makes a ton of sense like even though
[6261.16 → 6267.32] Jake and I are super into uh true Nazi and like higher end stuff at work both of us run unpaid at home
[6267.32 → 6272.76] because it's just so much easier to expand your storage you just put in a drive you don't have to add a
[6272.76 → 6277.32] whole additional v dev of drives the consumers don't buy stuff like that or at least they don't
[6277.32 → 6288.76] want to right um Matthew asks uh lovesick section couch with stealth tech review when no one on YouTube
[6288.76 → 6292.44] has a review of this, yet it's a modular sectional couch with built-in speakers I think we actually
[6292.44 → 6299.48] reached out to them asking for a review unit and then um basically we have a policy that we will not
[6299.48 → 6304.60] trade coverage for product you're welcome to send us a product, but we're not promising anything
[6304.60 → 6311.16] because as soon as we trade coverage for product there are um tax and conflict of interest issues
[6311.16 → 6316.36] so we like to be up front we're like hey look you're we are interested is what we'll say we're
[6316.36 → 6322.04] interested in reviewing this, and we would like to review it, but we don't promise anything because
[6322.68 → 6326.04] uh I don't want to be stuck making a video about something that is like
[6326.04 → 6331.48] bad, but not bad in an entertaining way like just bad but uninteresting it's just boring like I don't
[6331.48 → 6340.04] want to make boring videos right so um we basically said no and then I forget if it ever came back up
[6340.04 → 6345.96] again but I think my intention was to just buy one, but we have not dealt with that so it's its on our
[6345.96 → 6352.44] radar, but we haven't gotten around to it yet um jams y asks what type of metal are the screwdriver bits
[6352.44 → 6356.84] going to be oh uh okay do you want to do a couple of other super chats while I run and grab we've
[6356.84 → 6366.60] actually got packaging for the bit clips yep uh I don't know about that one moving forward
[6369.56 → 6373.96] storage server stuff lines will probably want to respond to that I have no idea who this is
[6373.96 → 6382.92] uh I'll address it anyway have you guys heard of ZAM half I actually think I have but I think it's
[6382.92 → 6388.52] not pronounced that way and I think I've heard it um he's a 22-year-old dude who manufactures actual
[6388.52 → 6394.76] semiconductor chips in his jaw in his garage uh using now vintage equipment his last chip has
[6394.76 → 6400.52] 1000 plus transistors wow that's crazy possibly cool video he seems like a pretty interesting guy
[6400.52 → 6411.56] I love the show that's cool that's sweet uh you have featured products that would be a great benefit
[6411.56 → 6417.56] to people who are blind uh the webcam with AI for example could the lab please test the accessibility
[6417.56 → 6424.52] of the apps and product um you have to own before you find out they aren't um
[6424.52 → 6430.36] uh that could be, and it's what the lab is going to do and how it's going to do it and all
[6430.36 → 6438.20] that kind of stuff is still so nebulous and up in the air um I would make sure that you bring that up
[6438.20 → 6442.76] again I'm not telling you to make another merch message if there isn't something that you want to
[6442.76 → 6447.80] buy, but you could tweet us or if there is something you want to buy yeah do another rich message I'd bring
[6447.80 → 6454.60] that up again once the lab has people that have been hired for it um because at this time no one
[6454.60 → 6459.88] has been hired for the lab there is nothing actually happening yet um people are going to be hired a lot
[6459.88 → 6464.84] of the hiring for the lab is in its final stages are getting close to it, but it's not there yet so make
[6464.84 → 6470.76] sure you bring it up again later oh and there's no guarantee that if you haven't heard back that we
[6470.76 → 6476.28] won't reach out we just haven't finalized how many positions we're hiring yeah um but a lot of the
[6476.28 → 6481.80] ones that we do know we're hiring are quite uh quite far in yeah did this get unplugged oh how'd
[6481.80 → 6487.88] that happen whoops uh okay so I thought it said on the packaging um what they were made of but it
[6487.88 → 6496.20] actually just says uh blah blah blah 20 millimeters so it doesn't come in the screwdriver it just comes
[6496.20 → 6503.08] in its own little box yes you put it in yourself because basically the labour cost of doing it that way
[6503.08 → 6508.44] was like really high, and we were like this doesn't make any sense I mean I'd because yeah who cares
[6508.44 → 6513.40] we expect a lot of people to build out their own bit load anyway so at launch we're going to try and
[6513.40 → 6522.20] have all of these available which are additional bit uh like bit sets so we'll have ones that mirror the
[6522.20 → 6527.40] uh the shipping one the one that it comes with in case you just want more of them, and then we'll have
[6527.40 → 6533.72] ones that are basically tuned for everything so we'll have a Philip set which has two Philip zeros
[6533.72 → 6540.68] can I open this yeah four Philips one's four Philips twos and two Philips threes just in case you want to
[6540.68 → 6546.12] have extra Philippe we'll have a metric hex set that'll have everything from 1.5 all the way to six
[6546.12 → 6554.44] we'll have an imperial hex set that goes from 0.05 to quarter inch uh we'll have a torn security torn set
[6554.44 → 6563.16] that is t3 t4 t5 t6 7 8 9 10 15 20 25 and 30, and then we'll have the FM set which we're calling the
[6563.16 → 6570.52] specialty set which is basically when manufacturers say FM, and it'll have things like tricking pantalone
[6570.52 → 6579.08] um super, super tiny Philippe so uh y 000 y 00 y y1 y2 actually that's not Philips is if it's something
[6579.08 → 6583.72] else is that like positive drive or something I can't remember what that one is what is why oh no it oh
[6583.72 → 6588.52] oh why is try why is that tricking if I recall correctly yep uh, and then it'll also have that
[6588.52 → 6595.88] weird like spanner bit um, so these will all be available for like pretty, pretty reasonable prices
[6595.88 → 6601.40] at launch but all it says is black phosphate finish unfortunately it's not actually on the package and i
[6601.40 → 6610.84] don't remember but I told kyle to get the best one so hopefully it's the best one he went all engineering
[6610.84 → 6616.28] on the answer to me, and he was like um actually there isn't the best metal to make bits out of
[6616.28 → 6622.76] because there are trade-offs between malleability different things and uh are like uh rigidity
[6622.76 → 6629.64] and uh like uh shatter proneness and this stuff like that and I'm just like okay that's that's fair
[6629.64 → 6638.20] enough but I want the best one for the what we're doing he's like okay uh someone asked and i
[6638.20 → 6642.36] accidentally click archive but I remember what it was um how's the how's the house coming along
[6644.28 → 6651.56] you keep getting unplugged I know right dang it house is coming good not great uh we're hoping to
[6651.56 → 6657.96] be moved in soonish uh there's an update video coming so it's actually shot and edited already so
[6657.96 → 6664.44] it should be coming really soon and uh basically we caught them the day before they started putting up
[6664.44 → 6671.56] drywall so it's kind of oh yeah it's a tour of behind the drywall all the tech that we've built
[6671.56 → 6677.00] into the house over the last few months I'm really excited to show you guys that it's my it's
[6677.00 → 6683.32] my dream tech house there's just no other way to put it uh will there ever be something on product
[6683.32 → 6690.36] pages that names the designer or designers uh main planner or planners of a product I would love to see
[6690.36 → 6697.16] who has had their hand in doing which products interesting um that's not something that
[6697.16 → 6703.88] we had planned but something that you can do if you want to get insight into that is subscribe to the
[6703.88 → 6710.76] newsletter uh we actually had one that went out today uh happy 2022 you all um nick put this
[6710.76 → 6715.88] together we had a busy start to the year lots that's why we haven't sent any out this year uh if you
[6715.88 → 6720.28] haven't seen the recent LTT videos featuring our new cable tester they're recommended but not required
[6720.28 → 6725.56] to boost your understanding of some of the concepts outlined in this update because kyle put together a
[6726.60 → 6736.84] sick like absolutely awesome little lesson for you guys about how crap USB cables are and why check
[6736.84 → 6742.36] this out, so this is the kind of this is the kind of stuff that like a good engineer can do if you
[6742.36 → 6749.00] actually give them time so he's going he's disassembling the cables finding um let's have a
[6749.00 → 6754.76] look here but about this is probably a really long one he actually gave me the in person uh when we
[6754.76 → 6760.12] had our merch meeting on uh Tuesday morning shielded differential pair yeah all of them failed our signal
[6760.12 → 6768.12] integrity testing uh here we go, so this is really important shielding is not wireless it's like putting
[6768.12 → 6774.12] on an ungrounded ESD band and expecting the static to be magically absorbed because the cables that we
[6774.12 → 6779.56] got out they have shielding you can see the shielding wrapped around these uh differential pairs
[6779.56 → 6785.16] here or signal pairs or whatever you want I think they're differential pairs look I'm not an engineer
[6785.16 → 6792.20] my lingo might not be quite right but the shielding here it's not grounded to anything yeah so
[6792.20 → 6798.44] it's just it's just sitting there it doesn't do anything amazing right uh so he shows what it
[6798.44 → 6805.40] looks like when one is actually grounded correctly which is super cool uh explains how there needs to
[6805.40 → 6811.64] be a third conductor in with the twisted pairs uh it's almost like following the spec actually makes
[6811.64 → 6818.44] a cable work haha who could he make the bad cables work this is not something I would have necessarily
[6818.44 → 6824.84] told him to spend time on, but he did um so he tried to take the not properly shielded ones and ground
[6824.84 → 6831.32] the shield to see if they'd get any better no they still failed um so we're we are hard at work on our
[6831.32 → 6837.64] cables I promise you that when we launch them they will be awesome and if you guys want to know more
[6837.64 → 6840.92] about the behind the scenes of what's going on at creator warehouse you're definitely going to want
[6840.92 → 6846.12] to sign up for the newsletter because you can expect more educational stuff like that it's not just
[6846.12 → 6850.44] about selling you stuff yeah we're going to want to let you know when there's something new for you
[6850.44 → 6857.88] to buy because like that's how we survive but uh we also want to make sure that it's another content
[6857.88 → 6863.72] stream for us so uh make sure you go uh iceberg says hey there's still no archive available
[6863.72 → 6869.40] for the newsletters which for really cool ones like this there really should be its coming oh Tynan's
[6869.40 → 6874.76] in the float plane chat hey thanks Tynan it is s2 tool steel with a black phosphate coating oh
[6876.12 → 6881.40] didn't even occur to me to message Tynan or uh kyle because it's like after hours but hey if Tynan's
[6881.40 → 6886.12] going to be in the chat answering questions might as well so Tynan is one of our other engineers in
[6886.12 → 6894.84] creator warehouse it's also super cool also has improved in badminton a lot in the last year and i
[6894.84 → 6899.72] haven't you've improved a little well I haven't been there well not lately, but you still improved a little
[6899.72 → 6904.84] before you stopped coming yeah I want to go back my shoulder's just been messed up for people that don't have
[6904.84 → 6912.36] context there uh are we going to test the steam deck running windows uh oh of course okay yeah
[6912.36 → 6915.32] yeah of course i just yeah wasn't 100 sure
[6918.68 → 6921.64] okay that's the general one I'm checking the incoming by the way if you want to keep going
[6921.64 → 6926.28] through curated yeah I was just having a look at some of the topics that we like didn't cover today
[6927.08 → 6932.04] oh uh maybe we'll just push them to next week or something i have to know where to be I don't know I was
[6932.04 → 6936.36] just no, no I don't I don't want to I don't want to cover them let's do it when show till midnight
[6936.36 → 6943.80] no let's go no um also when the lab is up and running will you be evaluating your own products
[6943.80 → 6947.24] to see how they hold up and also publishing those results that's not the first time we've had that
[6947.24 → 6954.04] request I think I forgot to ask you about that um I don't see why not I would think we'd have to but
[6954.04 → 6961.32] the thing is that they would be collaborating in the early stages like we would use the lab to internally
[6961.32 → 6965.32] validate things I guess, and you'd probably see that type of stuff in the newsletter and whatnot so
[6965.32 → 6970.76] like it might not be in the exact same way that other products are I mean if it's something that we
[6970.76 → 6979.80] if it's a tech product that we ultimately release than yeah yeah why not right like we obviously it
[6979.80 → 6984.60] would be to our benefit to have our product in the database right it's like almost more advertising at
[6984.60 → 6991.32] that point yeah yeah I'm super I'm super down Tristan first time making wan show all this talk
[6991.32 → 6996.04] on motherboards has me wondering what's your oh my goodness they're still coming in so fast what's
[6996.04 → 7000.12] your recommendation for motherboard brands I've had bad experiences with gigabyte and I want to move away
[7000.12 → 7005.00] from them in my next build frankly I've had bad experiences with every single major brand all of them
[7005.00 → 7014.52] all of them what you my the best motherboard buying advice that I can give you is buy the most popular
[7014.52 → 7022.04] model okay the most popular model that is somewhere in the neighbourhood of like four and a half to five
[7022.04 → 7029.96] stars because odds are that compared to really low-end stuff which never gets any love and really high-end
[7029.96 → 7036.60] stuff that they don't sell enough of to justify paying attention to that mid-range mid to high-end
[7036.60 → 7041.48] is where you get the real r d effort put in and where you are more likely to get better long-term
[7041.48 → 7045.72] support that's all I can really tell you because we've had experience of this too when you go on
[7045.72 → 7051.72] the ultra high-end uh no one owns it so you're going to be the only one that runs into certain problems
[7051.72 → 7057.32] then there are no fixes for it, and it's like what so we're going to piss off like 800 people
[7057.32 → 7063.80] yeah you know when you're a company at that kind of scale for almost any of them really yeah I've
[7063.80 → 7070.68] seen it I've seen it uh there's a there's a question here asking if we think we will ever sell our own
[7071.24 → 7077.32] mice or keyboards uh absolutely that's something that we would want to explore I think that for us
[7077.32 → 7083.08] the big question has to be what are we contributing what are we adding right because
[7083.08 → 7088.52] let's take a mouse for example are we going to be able to go toe-to-toe with Logitech for cost
[7089.72 → 7097.08] no obviously not are we going to be able to go up against racer for branding no come on right are we
[7097.08 → 7106.44] going to go and sponsor esports teams like uh hyper x no, no right so we have to figure out what is
[7106.44 → 7113.24] our place, and then we have to figure out if we can actually build something that matches what we
[7113.24 → 7118.92] imagine our place to be so those are big questions that you have to have the answers to
[7118.92 → 7124.36] before you can undertake a project like that Sean says from New Zealand I've recently built a storage
[7124.36 → 7127.72] server running on read to consolidate a number of hard drives that have a lot of duplicate files
[7128.60 → 7132.52] can you recommend any tools to help sort through duplicate files I've actually looked for this not
[7132.52 → 7137.80] that long ago I was trying to get rid of duplicate photos I wanted something like the old canon zoom
[7137.80 → 7144.60] browser software but modern and like just to deduplicate things and I didn't find anything
[7144.60 → 7150.68] good I found a couple open source ones but my library was so enormous that they just weren't able to
[7150.68 → 7156.28] handle it in a reasonable amount of time and I got distracted because I had other things to do and I gave up
[7156.28 → 7162.12] so that's where I'm at on that um maybe the chat we'll have some ideas there's stuff out there but
[7162.12 → 7168.44] I haven't used anything in forever I wouldn't know of a particular recommendation uh dupe guru is
[7168.44 → 7177.96] recommended by full the mattress so be careful yeah uh it could be terrible though it could be adware
[7177.96 → 7186.04] for all I know so I'm not recommending anything sorry Alexandra says Alexander uh very excited about
[7186.04 → 7190.68] the lab any plans covering the privacy aspect of different devices when analyzing them in the lab
[7190.68 → 7196.44] for example when comparing phones VR headsets set-top boxes smartwatches etc that's a difficult thing
[7196.44 → 7200.68] for us to tackle now it's something that we want to consider in the future something we've talked
[7200.68 → 7207.08] about for example is the percentage of your TV home screen that is taken up by ads it's like it's a
[7207.08 → 7211.88] simple benchmark right, but it's I think it's a meaningful one in regard to privacy stuff too there's
[7211.88 → 7217.24] maybe some stuff that the software engineer that works in the labs department could do to
[7217.80 → 7225.24] uh try to monitor things like homo uh like various internet of things devices that are around your
[7225.24 → 7230.36] house yeah what type of calls they're making out to the internet for sure um it could be something
[7230.36 → 7237.08] interesting to check for uh Paul's asks uh do you plan on doing more videos on non-terrestrial ISPS
[7237.08 → 7241.56] uh similar to the Starlink video I know a lot of people are still without high speed internet or an internet
[7241.56 → 7246.28] connection in general it's something we're very interested in, but it's something that is not
[7246.28 → 7252.60] always trivial to get your hands on and then get rid of in a timely manner like Starlink was super easy
[7252.60 → 7257.00] we just ordered it set it up said hey we don't want it anymore and shipped it back they have like
[7257.00 → 7261.32] Starlink pro or whatever is coming it's way faster oh really I haven't seen that yet I don't really know
[7261.32 → 7268.28] a lot of details but uh Darren says it's my 22nd birthday today hey happy birthday Darren um for Luke and
[7268.28 → 7272.36] Linus I'm in penetration testing class and was wondering how LTT and float plane handle testing
[7272.36 → 7275.88] their platforms do you do internal testing only or do you hire up for verification what a good
[7275.88 → 7280.76] question Luke what do we do internal testing internal hiring out for verification is a very good idea
[7281.32 → 7287.64] it can also be extremely expensive um it's its not something that I would recommend against but you
[7287.64 → 7292.28] do have to consider your company size and the type of money that you can spend on that type of
[7292.28 → 7299.40] stuff um and the type of data and whatnot that you're dealing with right like if you're is you're
[7299.40 → 7304.68] a law firm website that actually deals with important documents through the platform for some
[7304.68 → 7311.40] reason like yeah you should have internal and external uh looking at your service making
[7311.40 → 7316.84] sure it's really secure um but yeah we just do internal at this time I'm not saying it'll be that way
[7316.84 → 7325.16] forever um and actually luckily we have a very good and positive community um that has poked around
[7325.16 → 7329.64] and sent us stuff to our like support channels and be like hey this thing is maybe not great for
[7329.64 → 7336.92] whatever reason and we look into that so we don't pay for external um but thanks bros but
[7336.92 → 7343.96] thanks bros and gals and everything in between yeah bastion says I'm making a studio desk with a
[7343.96 → 7348.20] rack mount pc do you have any advice about rack mount cases on the market oh man most of them are
[7348.20 → 7353.72] just terrible for a desktop pc that was why I ultimately built my own for my water cooled system
[7354.52 → 7361.24] um unfortunately I just haven't looked into it for a long time um and bastion also asks Luke when you
[7361.24 → 7368.76] code what kind of music helps you get in the zone mine is warcraft 2 or jazz coffee shops uh jazz coffee
[7368.76 → 7376.12] shops is a pretty standard one um that I've used for a long time uh you mentioned warcraft 2 Klein
[7377.72 → 7384.36] yeah okay that's been one that I've used since I was like 14 Klein Rubin says I started watching
[7384.36 → 7388.52] when I was pretty green in it, I am now the endpoint architect for a large healthcare provider nice
[7388.52 → 7392.60] thanks for helping me stay inspired and entertained through the journey love seeing LTT grow hey thanks so
[7392.60 → 7399.16] much Ruben heck yeah and final merch message for the night car right will there ever be something on
[7399.16 → 7402.52] the product pages that names the design oh we already did that one oh we already talked about
[7402.52 → 7407.88] that just didn't press archive okay see you later uh oh wait here we go anonymous says can you post a
[7407.88 → 7414.44] list of all the tech in your new house and how much it costs as a fellow one-percenter I want to deck out
[7414.44 → 7422.28] my house as well but I don't know where to begin so pay someone you're a one-percenter also if you don't
[7422.28 → 7428.76] know you need it you don't need it no we want them to spend money we want the 0.1 presenters to spend
[7428.76 → 7436.84] money okay I mean also yeah they should spend money too but like I said oh man see that's the thing
[7436.84 → 7441.72] I don't want to advocate for people just mindlessly consuming either well I'm not worried if one
[7441.72 → 7450.84] presenters do that ah okay outside that I would strongly agree as per usual but okay I mean that's my
[7450.84 → 7457.32] take on it, you don't have to share it that's fair um okay thanks Tyler f snuck one last one in
[7457.32 → 7465.40] there all right I think we're calling it for today thank you guys so much for tuning in to the
[7465.40 → 7472.04] Wang show today we actually had a ton of viewers today this is crazy you guys are you guys are amazing
[7473.00 → 7478.84] we uh we had a bit of a lull there in viewership, and then it's like stormed back today you guys you
[7478.84 → 7497.32] guys are awesome uh we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
