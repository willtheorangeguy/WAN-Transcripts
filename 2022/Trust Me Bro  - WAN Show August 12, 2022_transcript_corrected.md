[0.00 → 4.10] What's up and welcome to the WAN show!
[4.24 → 6.94] We've got a fantastic show lined up for you guys this week.
[7.50 → 9.52] I promise.
[14.68 → 20.84] The main topics this week, Luke, are obviously going to be
[20.84 → 24.66] War and Seagate, as I've been affectionately referring to it.
[24.66 → 27.02] I thought you were going to say War and Peace, and I thought it was fair.
[27.02 → 31.40] I mean, there's some War, but there's not a lot of Peace lately.
[34.10 → 38.74] In other news, New egg reacts to a pricing error in the worst way.
[39.42 → 40.88] Yeah, deflection.
[42.38 → 43.42] Look at New egg.
[43.88 → 46.20] We'll be talking about that in a little bit.
[46.24 → 47.54] What else we got going on here?
[48.20 → 49.10] Oh, nothing.
[50.44 → 51.78] Meta's tracking you.
[51.94 → 52.86] Yeah, Meta's bad.
[52.86 → 53.86] Also...
[53.86 → 58.68] No, I want to live in the Metaverse!
[59.40 → 62.08] If I lived in the Metaverse, I wouldn't have to wear these pants!
[62.90 → 63.82] Oh, wow.
[63.94 → 64.96] He's doing it.
[65.02 → 66.32] Actually, it's a little chilly in here.
[66.32 → 67.26] It is a little cold today.
[67.26 → 69.66] You guys have the AC down way too low in here.
[69.72 → 70.58] You know that, right, Dan?
[70.82 → 72.46] Yes, it upsets me quite a lot, too.
[72.54 → 74.20] Okay, who is responsible for that?
[74.26 → 77.42] Because it's actually like, when it's 35 degrees Celsius outside,
[77.42 → 79.52] and you guys have it set to freaking like 18 in here,
[79.82 → 82.44] that's a not insignificant expenditure.
[83.04 → 84.12] Yeah, sometimes you have to wear a sweater.
[84.32 → 86.00] And they leave it on over the weekend.
[86.26 → 89.70] It's on all hours of the day, just like a walk-in fridge here.
[89.76 → 90.92] Is there anything we can do about that?
[90.98 → 91.72] Who's responsible?
[91.94 → 92.22] You know what?
[92.24 → 95.62] You can tell me off the show, but I think there are two...
[95.62 → 95.64] Yeah!
[96.04 → 96.60] I'm upset.
[96.70 → 97.60] Where did he get him?
[97.80 → 100.04] I'm cold right now, and it's summer.
[100.16 → 100.86] It's August.
[101.06 → 103.42] Personally, I like it, but it's also...
[103.42 → 104.20] I think there's a problem with it.
[105.02 → 105.82] It's also...
[105.82 → 107.12] Yeah, it's too cold.
[107.12 → 108.38] Netflix has games!
[108.62 → 108.86] What?
[108.96 → 109.56] That's crazy.
[109.68 → 110.52] Time to start the show.
[110.52 → 110.70] Netflix has games?
[111.32 → 112.46] All right, let's do it.
[132.62 → 134.70] The show is brought to you today by Wealth front,
[134.70 → 137.12] Sea sonic and Vulture.
[137.28 → 139.82] You know, I heard Sea sonic has really long warranties on their power supplies.
[140.02 → 140.66] Real long ones.
[140.92 → 146.32] All right, let's get started with our most important topic today,
[146.46 → 147.70] and that is that...
[148.70 → 150.10] Let's see.
[150.90 → 151.54] You're just gonna...
[151.54 → 153.70] Google is trying to evolve texting.
[154.54 → 155.18] That's right.
[155.70 → 156.84] That's an important topic.
[156.84 → 158.10] The Burke and Mac rumours.
[158.10 → 160.52] This week, Google launched a campaign...
[160.52 → 161.22] Oh, we're really doing it.
[161.30 → 161.42] Okay.
[161.80 → 164.24] ...explicitly asking Apple to adopt RCS.
[164.88 → 170.04] On their page, they outlined the substandard green bubble experience of iPhone users,
[170.18 → 175.20] like low-resolution multimedia messages, broken and limited group chats.
[175.28 → 175.84] That's true.
[176.26 → 182.70] No typing indicators or red receipts, and no ability to send over Wi-Fi or with end-to-end encryption.
[182.70 → 184.32] This is how you get more watch time, kids.
[184.78 → 187.84] Despite a very chaotic instant messaging strategy,
[188.36 → 192.92] Google has been trying to get RCS more widely adopted for a while now.
[193.06 → 196.14] But thanks to reticence from carriers and ignorance from Apple,
[196.52 → 198.48] Google's been the sole torch bearer.
[199.38 → 202.54] Maybe if they hadn't crushed all their other competition,
[202.68 → 203.68] we'd still have Windows Phone.
[203.82 → 205.66] Not that Microsoft is exactly, you know,
[205.72 → 209.06] the shining star of making sure that there's no monopoly or duopoly.
[209.06 → 212.56] Basically, implementing the service from their servers
[212.56 → 216.58] and implementing features like end-to-end encryption on their own.
[217.44 → 219.16] Our discussion question is,
[219.66 → 220.82] how many iPhones...
[220.82 → 222.20] They're editing it in real time.
[222.28 → 224.30] Are you really going to avoid talking about the warranty thing?
[224.32 → 226.02] No, I'm going to talk about the warranty thing.
[226.04 → 226.44] Oh, my goodness.
[226.44 → 228.40] I said right at the beginning of the show,
[228.50 → 230.36] I'm going to talk about the warranty thing.
[231.06 → 231.66] Jeez, no.
[231.84 → 232.56] These are...
[232.56 → 234.16] Bring back my discussion questions.
[235.06 → 236.84] Okay, these are from Jonathan Horst,
[236.84 → 238.24] our host for Mac Address.
[238.24 → 242.60] How many iPhone users have you met that are snobby towards green bubbles?
[243.24 → 243.88] I don't know,
[243.96 → 247.48] but I heard it actually like dramatically harms your dating prospects
[247.48 → 248.64] to have a green bubble.
[248.76 → 250.20] Yeah, there was an article that I was reading.
[250.28 → 252.82] They like actually like studied this
[252.82 → 255.26] with a not insignificant sample size.
[255.46 → 257.92] And it was like the conclusion,
[258.62 → 259.88] people are shallow.
[261.08 → 262.22] I mean, it's good.
[262.28 → 263.22] It's good we know this.
[263.32 → 264.28] I don't text often.
[264.28 → 266.94] Most of my text messages are for like service alerts.
[266.94 → 270.28] Like, like, like full plane servers and stuff.
[270.28 → 273.64] Well, that's because you're a gig chad who uses like Signal or something.
[274.02 → 274.16] So...
[274.16 → 274.72] That's true.
[274.90 → 275.10] Yeah.
[275.34 → 277.90] So, like, iMessage what?
[278.18 → 278.82] Yeah, I don't know.
[279.34 → 280.74] Every time that we talk about this,
[280.76 → 281.76] I'm just like, I don't know.
[281.96 → 283.74] Maybe it's an Androidification thing
[283.74 → 285.78] that I don't use the text messaging thing
[285.78 → 286.62] that comes with my phone.
[286.62 → 287.94] I use Signal instead.
[288.38 → 291.40] Maybe that's like, maybe if it was better, I wouldn't.
[292.12 → 292.90] I don't know.
[293.08 → 296.92] People in flow plane chat are like, um, actually, you know,
[297.04 → 299.20] banned from group chats because of green messages.
[300.38 → 303.44] I prefer blue chats, but not a dealbreaker.
[303.86 → 307.36] I get my balls busted for being a green bubble all the time.
[308.60 → 309.80] I've never experienced it.
[309.80 → 311.78] I just, I have never experienced it either.
[311.78 → 314.82] I mean, part of it is that I wasn't in high school or middle school
[314.82 → 316.76] when iPhones were a thing, right?
[317.48 → 317.60] Yeah.
[317.66 → 319.18] And I mean, nobody had a BlackBerry.
[319.26 → 321.06] That was for like your dad.
[321.20 → 321.46] Yeah.
[321.62 → 323.60] The guys with the hip holsters and stuff.
[323.60 → 323.80] Right?
[323.90 → 324.78] It was like, it was...
[325.30 → 326.96] None of the kids had BlackBerry's.
[327.04 → 328.38] Or none of the people that I knew, at least.
[329.26 → 331.28] My school was also like kind of in the boonies.
[331.48 → 332.12] So, you know.
[332.60 → 333.54] Yeah, fair enough.
[333.62 → 334.58] This is wild, though.
[334.64 → 337.06] The number of people that are like, yeah, it's...
[337.06 → 338.94] You hear this all the time.
[339.10 → 340.78] It's like a super persistent thing.
[340.78 → 343.60] And there are some things that aren't really legit that you hear all the time
[343.60 → 347.34] because the people that it's pointed at like to complain that it's happening,
[347.46 → 348.02] even though it's not.
[348.26 → 350.82] But like, this seems to be one of those things that's actually real.
[350.90 → 352.86] But I have no experience with it, so I don't know.
[352.90 → 354.72] It makes my brain hurt every single time.
[355.28 → 355.64] Yeah.
[355.96 → 357.60] Who cares?
[359.30 → 363.80] The banning because of it, I feel like there might be some more going on there.
[363.84 → 365.20] I feel like that was an excuse.
[365.32 → 367.46] No, it can also, it can break some interactions.
[367.46 → 371.98] So, it'll do things like, for example, when I'm texting someone on an iPhone,
[372.10 → 375.72] my sister has an iPhone, and if she reacts to a message,
[375.96 → 378.44] I will get a full-on SMS notification,
[379.32 → 383.36] Bella reacted thumbs up to your message.
[383.46 → 385.92] And like, I think it copies the contents of my message.
[386.20 → 387.82] I don't want a text message for this.
[388.08 → 388.70] Oh, I actually like that.
[388.70 → 390.82] I also don't want a notification for people just going,
[390.98 → 392.48] boo-boo, on my messages.
[392.84 → 394.16] So, that's maybe the same problem.
[394.58 → 395.66] That should just be a setting thing.
[395.74 → 396.84] But I do like that, personally.
[397.02 → 400.86] Because for me, it's like, this is a full confirm that I have read,
[401.54 → 403.90] and I'm good with whatever this is.
[404.20 → 404.42] You know?
[404.74 → 407.00] Maybe, okay, maybe I mostly like that because of Slack.
[407.98 → 408.38] Yeah.
[408.48 → 411.32] Because I like the work confirmation of someone being like,
[411.44 → 411.70] got it.
[411.70 → 414.04] This is just you from like a business perspective.
[414.04 → 414.32] Maybe.
[414.44 → 417.58] And whereas people in just having personal conversations,
[417.66 → 420.80] and again, a lot of people treat their social lives very business-like.
[421.32 → 423.76] You know, everything's like scheduled, and they're coordinating.
[424.10 → 424.90] Yeah, I definitely don't do that.
[425.24 → 426.22] Yeah, yeah.
[426.42 → 429.72] I'm just like, I'm making burgers.
[430.36 → 431.66] I wonder if Luke is hungry.
[432.80 → 434.32] What if I could also get him to move?
[434.52 → 434.82] Yeah.
[434.96 → 437.10] Yeah, maybe he could also help me move a dresser.
[437.34 → 437.52] Yeah.
[437.64 → 438.64] This could work.
[438.74 → 439.22] And a bed.
[439.54 → 440.14] Boo-book-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.
[440.14 → 441.02] I don't remember everything else.
[441.02 → 442.54] That was kind of a fun day, though.
[443.70 → 445.58] I almost needed to call you again.
[445.68 → 448.10] We had other dressers, but Yvonne's shoulder's feeling a little better,
[448.18 → 448.82] so she helped me move.
[448.82 → 448.98] Okay.
[449.22 → 449.48] All right.
[449.64 → 450.74] But I was very close.
[450.80 → 452.46] I was very close to calling Luke again.
[452.48 → 453.62] I see you, Yvonne, trying to replace me.
[453.68 → 454.12] I get it.
[454.74 → 456.96] Um, well, I...
[456.96 → 458.82] Don't think about it too hard, okay?
[459.10 → 461.02] Yeah, and that's probably for the best.
[462.30 → 463.02] All right.
[463.22 → 466.42] Should we now get into...
[466.42 → 467.06] Oh, man.
[467.14 → 467.60] I don't know.
[467.64 → 468.08] Are we doing it?
[468.26 → 469.06] Are we diving right in?
[469.06 → 469.88] Well, I don't know.
[470.00 → 470.36] It depends.
[470.36 → 473.00] It depends on which one you want first.
[473.20 → 473.82] I think warranty.
[474.02 → 475.14] I think that's what people are here for.
[475.20 → 476.56] You want to do warranty first?
[476.70 → 477.16] I think so.
[477.96 → 480.70] Um, are you sure?
[481.22 → 484.80] I mean, the allegations are quite scandalous, though.
[485.12 → 486.16] It's whichever one you want to do.
[486.32 → 487.26] Flip a coin at this point.
[487.40 → 488.08] Google Flip a Coin.
[488.08 → 488.58] Let's do it.
[488.58 → 488.62] Let's do it.
[488.62 → 489.48] Let's flip a coin.
[489.62 → 490.10] Let's flip a coin.
[490.16 → 490.78] Who's got a coin?
[491.40 → 492.54] Oh, you can literally just Google it.
[492.56 → 493.32] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[493.38 → 493.82] That's...
[494.92 → 495.48] Please.
[496.14 → 498.58] Why don't you play some D&D with digital...
[498.58 → 500.04] Why don't you just use an Excel...
[500.04 → 500.44] That's fair.
[500.48 → 501.66] Why don't you use an Excel sheet?
[502.12 → 502.40] Okay?
[502.64 → 504.12] Just put random...
[504.12 → 504.82] Like...
[504.82 → 506.26] Please.
[506.88 → 508.14] Flip a digital coin.
[508.46 → 508.62] What?
[508.68 → 508.78] What?
[508.84 → 508.92] What?
[508.92 → 508.94] What?
[508.94 → 508.96] What?
[508.96 → 509.02] What?
[509.02 → 509.04] What?
[509.04 → 509.08] What?
[509.08 → 509.32] What?
[509.32 → 509.44] What?
[509.44 → 510.14] You got to call it now.
[510.50 → 510.64] Yeah.
[510.78 → 511.08] Well, no.
[511.18 → 512.32] You call it.
[512.36 → 512.86] You call it.
[513.10 → 513.22] Okay.
[513.28 → 514.16] Heads is backpack.
[516.70 → 517.32] It's heads.
[517.60 → 518.02] It's heads.
[518.20 → 518.98] We do backpack first.
[519.08 → 519.52] Thanks for the loonies.
[519.54 → 519.78] That's mine!
[520.10 → 520.60] Got them.
[520.98 → 521.64] It's actually...
[521.64 → 522.44] Loonies are cool.
[522.76 → 523.20] All right.
[524.12 → 526.92] I was going to say it's worth a lot of money, but these days with inflation, it's a little
[526.92 → 527.52] bit less, you know?
[528.84 → 530.56] Let's jump right into it.
[530.66 → 534.04] I said a lot of things last week.
[534.04 → 534.40] Oh!
[535.26 → 535.84] Sure did.
[535.92 → 536.48] And this week.
[536.80 → 538.20] There were some things I said this week.
[538.20 → 539.74] You're going to next week as well.
[540.64 → 541.30] Thanks, Luke.
[541.44 → 541.84] That's really helpful.
[541.84 → 542.84] You just said a lot of things.
[542.94 → 543.90] You didn't say they're controversial.
[544.10 → 544.72] That's true.
[544.72 → 545.32] You say lots of things everywhere.
[545.36 → 546.24] I said a lot of...
[546.24 → 550.82] I said a lot of things that I didn't necessarily think were that controversial.
[551.10 → 555.42] And a lot of what I said could be interpreted a number of ways.
[555.76 → 558.96] The charitable interpretation could even be good.
[559.30 → 563.34] Whereas the cynical interpretation, in most cases, was pretty terrible.
[563.60 → 563.80] Okay.
[563.80 → 565.66] So I want to jump in on a few of these things as well.
[565.66 → 565.72] Sure.
[565.92 → 569.30] I take some of this flat because I should have stepped in during the show and I didn't because
[569.30 → 571.34] I don't know a lot about warranties.
[571.46 → 572.74] I'm just being open about that.
[572.86 → 577.56] I didn't know what normal warranties on backpacks are ever since I've looked that up.
[577.56 → 579.76] I didn't know, especially...
[579.76 → 584.00] Like I know what I would expect from warranties in the computer hardware space.
[584.12 → 587.44] But outside that specific space, I know basically nothing about warranties.
[587.62 → 588.72] I have no idea what...
[588.72 → 593.72] I've never tried to warranty return a shirt because I didn't even know that was a thing,
[594.02 → 594.28] et cetera.
[594.38 → 594.68] Yeah, for sure.
[594.68 → 596.44] So I mostly stayed out of it.
[596.54 → 600.84] You can warranty a bag of lemons that wasn't juicy enough at Costco if you really want
[600.84 → 601.04] to.
[601.24 → 602.10] Yeah, that's cool.
[602.50 → 603.54] After you've juiced them.
[604.96 → 606.22] These were not juicy enough.
[607.60 → 608.60] I didn't know that was a thing.
[608.60 → 609.84] That's an anecdote from Twitter.
[609.96 → 611.18] That's actually from a Twitter user.
[611.38 → 615.86] But I have a person in my life who has pulled very similar stunts.
[617.94 → 622.08] Like buy a watermelon, eat half of it, be like, this is not very delicious.
[623.12 → 626.40] And take half a watermelon back for a refund to Costco.
[626.62 → 626.78] Yes.
[627.78 → 628.18] Wow.
[628.34 → 632.20] The time of even getting a parking spot sounds like it probably wasn't very worth it.
[632.44 → 632.96] But...
[632.96 → 633.90] Hey, you do you.
[634.40 → 635.26] Also the...
[635.26 → 636.22] So there's...
[636.22 → 637.76] Maybe I'll let you talk a little bit more.
[637.92 → 638.22] Keep going.
[638.22 → 638.58] Sure.
[639.08 → 639.44] All right.
[639.50 → 641.88] So the first thing I said was, warranty?
[642.64 → 643.32] What warranty?
[644.14 → 646.60] Effectively amounted to, trust me, bro.
[647.06 → 648.92] And the two interpretations here.
[649.76 → 654.28] Interpretation number one is, this is the cynical interpretation that a lot of people went
[654.28 → 654.54] for.
[654.70 → 655.66] A lot of people didn't.
[656.76 → 662.84] You know, the cold hard facts are that the total number of backpack cancellations numbered
[662.84 → 663.84] in the few dozens.
[664.38 → 665.24] It was not a lot.
[665.24 → 671.52] For the most part, I think this community knows what I'm about, knows what our company stands
[671.52 → 674.78] for, and went, yeah, they'll figure it out.
[675.04 → 678.34] And to those of you who saw it that way, hey, thank you.
[678.84 → 679.70] Appreciate you.
[679.70 → 685.18] But there was clearly a very, very negative interpretation of what I said.
[685.24 → 689.30] He's clearly a weasel, knows these things are going to fall apart, putting him out of
[689.30 → 690.56] business if he stands behind it.
[690.60 → 691.88] And in that case, good riddance.
[691.88 → 694.76] Also, no warranty is, it's illegal.
[694.86 → 695.64] It's anti-consumer.
[695.76 → 696.90] What an**hole, right?
[697.50 → 701.82] So that's a valid interpretation, quite frankly.
[701.94 → 703.24] I didn't word it very well.
[703.58 → 705.68] Sorry, I want you to get through both of your interpretations.
[706.02 → 706.60] And then I'll respond.
[706.74 → 707.72] Second interpretation.
[708.50 → 711.00] What I meant was that from my point of view, this is not urgent.
[711.62 → 715.46] And I don't give, I don't care what the legal requirements are for a warranty.
[715.46 → 721.02] We already dramatically exceed any legal requirements for a warranty or customer service.
[721.74 → 726.32] So from my point of view, I was going, well, this is, this is non-urgent.
[727.14 → 729.22] We can deal with this whenever.
[729.94 → 731.14] Another point of clarification.
[731.48 → 732.90] The backpack's not going to sink us.
[733.04 → 734.46] The screwdriver's not going to sink us.
[734.86 → 736.26] I see a lot of speculation.
[736.60 → 742.30] It's amazing where people will go with me saying something that was off the cuff,
[742.62 → 745.28] not worded very well, not thought out very well.
[745.46 → 748.08] And take that ball and run.
[749.28 → 751.92] You know, apparently the situation here is dire.
[752.24 → 754.08] I am cracking under the strain.
[754.32 → 755.10] I'm stressed.
[756.02 → 757.86] You know, truth is actually I am pretty stressed.
[758.00 → 759.62] I was going to say, some of that is fairly true.
[759.62 → 760.56] I have a lot going on.
[760.62 → 761.20] We've got merch.
[761.32 → 762.04] We've got labs.
[762.34 → 765.82] Yeah, we've got backpack and screwdriver, which were major investments for us.
[766.80 → 768.34] Some weird nerds are making a website.
[768.50 → 769.48] But here's the thing, guys.
[770.20 → 771.46] I also have Yvonne.
[773.12 → 774.84] She wouldn't let me overextend.
[774.84 → 780.22] And every single backpack, every single screwdriver could sink into the sea.
[781.62 → 782.92] Labs could fail.
[783.62 → 786.50] Or, you know, let's say it doesn't fail outright.
[786.88 → 792.82] But let's say it takes three to five years to even begin to generate anything in return,
[792.88 → 793.32] which it won't.
[793.32 → 795.24] We've got an amazing team we're building.
[795.32 → 796.04] It's going to be awesome.
[797.14 → 798.36] All of that could happen.
[798.70 → 800.26] And no one would lose their jobs.
[800.60 → 801.34] Not even Colton.
[801.98 → 802.66] I know, right?
[803.04 → 803.82] We will survive.
[804.60 → 809.14] It would be a long, painful road back to where we could start to reinvest again.
[809.14 → 815.18] But the good news is that because we're built on a really strong foundation, we own our buildings.
[815.62 → 815.78] Right?
[816.46 → 817.40] I got no landlord.
[817.86 → 822.86] I got no one who's going to say, you know, your rent's going up like this.
[823.04 → 825.12] Or, I mean, even interest rates.
[825.40 → 825.60] Right?
[825.82 → 826.82] The main studio?
[827.56 → 828.84] Here, full disclosure, guys.
[829.06 → 830.12] We own it outright.
[830.12 → 830.64] Right.
[830.74 → 836.24] Well, interest rates mean nothing to LMG for its main operating studio.
[836.36 → 837.02] We got this.
[837.68 → 840.94] So there's, like, property tax goes up and stuff too, right?
[841.02 → 843.14] Like little things and, like, utilities and whatnot.
[843.50 → 844.42] But the impact of that compared...
[844.42 → 848.12] If interest rates go up, property values are likely to go down.
[848.66 → 850.78] So my property taxes would probably actually go down.
[851.06 → 851.40] Got it.
[851.48 → 852.08] I got this.
[852.16 → 852.70] Utilities and stuff.
[852.74 → 855.52] But, yeah, it's insanely smaller than...
[855.52 → 857.32] We could also pinch some pennies on utilities.
[858.22 → 859.48] There are levers we could pull.
[859.48 → 860.74] Like the cold.
[861.08 → 861.64] Yeah, we could go.
[861.86 → 862.12] We could go.
[862.16 → 862.68] Yeah, yeah.
[862.72 → 863.26] Like that.
[863.42 → 868.52] Like the frigid temperature here in the podcast set, Dan.
[869.00 → 869.12] Yeah.
[869.44 → 870.52] You know, we could also...
[870.52 → 872.30] We could try and work some deals.
[872.60 → 875.10] You know, try and get a discount on some solar panels.
[875.48 → 877.40] Make some content about solar installations.
[877.56 → 878.26] Put them up on the roof.
[878.42 → 878.68] Boom.
[878.78 → 881.38] We've nailed down some of our utility fees.
[881.64 → 882.38] I think it'd be sweet anyway.
[882.62 → 883.98] There's just not a lot of sun in BC.
[884.30 → 884.86] I do want to do that.
[884.92 → 885.94] But, hey, it doesn't hurt.
[886.04 → 886.82] Like, at the house...
[886.82 → 886.88] Oh, absolutely.
[887.10 → 887.24] Yeah.
[887.24 → 889.44] Our utility bills are half of what they would be.
[889.74 → 890.24] Yeah, that's cool.
[890.28 → 891.14] It's pretty substantial.
[891.36 → 891.48] Yeah.
[892.98 → 895.22] So we got this.
[895.96 → 897.30] I have a kind of snarky bit.
[897.36 → 897.60] You know what?
[897.62 → 898.12] I'm just going to...
[898.12 → 898.70] I'm just...
[898.70 → 898.88] Yeah.
[899.16 → 900.46] I've made some notes about this.
[900.86 → 901.84] I'm just going to read it.
[901.90 → 903.38] Thank you for your analysis.
[903.38 → 907.20] But I will listen to the person who actually looks at the books.
[907.80 → 908.74] So thank you.
[909.12 → 909.92] But don't worry.
[910.02 → 910.42] We're okay.
[911.08 → 911.44] Okay.
[911.84 → 912.20] Yes.
[912.32 → 913.48] Maybe this is time to chime in.
[913.48 → 917.04] I get where you're coming from.
[917.16 → 918.56] And I think a fair amount of people did.
[918.90 → 929.16] But at the same time, this is not how we've highly suggested, is how I'll word it, that other people approach any other company.
[929.28 → 929.68] That's fair.
[929.68 → 935.08] We have always communicated that companies are not your friends.
[935.52 → 938.76] And we have also echoed that up with we are a company.
[939.16 → 939.26] Yeah.
[939.26 → 943.00] So having implicit trust without anything in writing is highly questionable.
[943.28 → 950.34] We've said in the past, and I was reminded about this by a comment that I saw somewhere, but it's not like I haven't heard it.
[951.56 → 963.00] We've said in the past, I think you specifically have said in the past, and you mentioned Sea sonic earlier in the show, that you can almost measure the quality of a power supply by how long its warranty is.
[963.64 → 968.28] We've gone after companies for having bad or non-existent warranties, all this type of stuff.
[968.28 → 976.58] We've done this type of stuff before to other companies, so I don't think that we should just be magically immune to it because of your or our reputation.
[976.70 → 982.12] I don't know that I've ever gone after someone for a bad warranty term.
[982.52 → 986.84] I've certainly gone after someone for treating customers poorly.
[987.98 → 989.56] So from my point of view.
[989.90 → 993.98] Having no shown warranty could be interpreted as treating customers poorly.
[994.12 → 997.48] We also stated that we would have a warranty, and then we started selling them with none posted.
[997.48 → 1004.94] And I do understand that you can make an argument of like, oh, we said we're going to have one by the time it ships, but we're expecting purchases now.
[1005.96 → 1007.46] So there isn't one right now.
[1007.58 → 1010.72] So currently, right now, as stated, there is nothing.
[1011.68 → 1017.72] Theoretically, there will be something, and we have some potential news on that coming up, which is perfect.
[1017.72 → 1021.08] But the purchase and stuff that we've been taking in so far have been without one.
[1021.32 → 1021.72] That's fair.
[1021.86 → 1022.48] And you know what?
[1022.56 → 1024.40] I think I actually have something.
[1024.54 → 1035.30] I don't know if you've looked at any of this, but I have a bit later where I kind of talk about, yeah, I clearly got this wrong.
[1035.44 → 1035.70] You know what?
[1035.72 → 1040.16] I'm just going to go through the next couple of things first, and then we'll get to that later.
[1040.16 → 1041.12] I can chime in again, too.
[1041.26 → 1047.46] But one thing I'll say before you get into that is we also critique people's responses to these types of situations.
[1047.86 → 1050.54] There's that computer building company that went down.
[1051.18 → 1052.12] I don't remember their name.
[1052.22 → 1052.42] I'm sorry.
[1052.54 → 1053.02] Oh, Overkill?
[1053.26 → 1053.58] Overkill?
[1053.66 → 1054.12] No, no, no.
[1054.14 → 1055.04] Overkill didn't go down.
[1055.46 → 1056.60] Sorry, I didn't mean down.
[1056.74 → 1058.26] I meant went down on the show.
[1058.62 → 1060.94] We conversed about it on the show.
[1061.00 → 1061.68] I worded that poorly.
[1061.76 → 1061.92] Sorry.
[1061.92 → 1066.90] But we conversed about their response to allegations on the show, and we've done that before.
[1067.42 → 1076.92] And I think that accepting that the response from us on this was honestly really rough and problematic in a bunch of ways is good.
[1077.00 → 1084.84] Because the same way that we instructed to them, at a certain point, you need to just be like, yep, and we're doing that, which is great.
[1085.28 → 1090.84] But accepting that we screwed up a little bit and just moving forward is the easier way and better way to do it.
[1090.84 → 1100.00] Another thing I said that has two possible interpretations, that our audience and our customers are okay with the current situation.
[1101.26 → 1108.64] One way of interpreting that is it sounds like I'm gatekeeping, basically saying, look, you need to get on board with the cult of LTT.
[1109.20 → 1109.52] Yeah.
[1109.68 → 1110.84] Or you can GTFO.
[1111.14 → 1111.38] Yeah.
[1111.82 → 1113.42] That's one possible interpretation.
[1113.74 → 1114.22] Join us.
[1114.22 → 1124.14] What I actually meant, and this also ties back into what you were talking about, what I actually meant is that anyone who's ever actually dealt with our support would already know that we go above and beyond.
[1124.84 → 1130.72] There is no warranty term internally in terms of the guidance that's given to support.
[1131.36 → 1132.68] There are no guidelines.
[1133.22 → 1134.58] The guideline is make it right.
[1135.22 → 1135.86] That's it.
[1136.30 → 1137.38] Make sure they're happy.
[1137.60 → 1137.74] Yeah.
[1137.74 → 1141.90] We have the same type of, same level of internal policy at Flow plane.
[1141.90 → 1143.22] Because it comes from the same person.
[1143.34 → 1143.80] That's true.
[1144.58 → 1149.40] The policies for our customer service representatives are very simple.
[1149.60 → 1150.56] There was actually a conversation.
[1150.72 → 1152.80] This is a little anecdotal and off-topic, so I'm sorry.
[1152.86 → 1157.74] But there was a conversation really early in Flow plane when we were kind of defining how we were going to do refunds.
[1157.74 → 1158.74] Right.
[1159.46 → 1166.64] And I was pushing back against you because I was like, well, if I can prove this person watched like 200 hours in the last week.
[1166.80 → 1167.62] I actually remember this.
[1167.62 → 1168.54] And they've had it for a week.
[1168.74 → 1170.44] Like, why should we refund them?
[1170.48 → 1171.12] Like, that's crazy.
[1171.18 → 1172.34] And you're like, no, I don't care.
[1173.02 → 1173.66] Just do it.
[1173.72 → 1174.96] And I was like, oh, fine.
[1175.18 → 1180.80] So, like, yeah, the internal policies on that type of stuff are very customer friendly, I will say.
[1180.90 → 1181.74] And very consistent.
[1182.46 → 1184.58] And I can talk more about why that is later.
[1184.58 → 1188.46] You don't have to trust me, but I would ask that you at least not think I'm an idiot.
[1188.74 → 1190.24] So we'll get into that in a bit.
[1190.80 → 1207.50] The last big one I think that people went two different directions with were the part where I was discussing, you know, what these commitments mean in the event that, you know, there's some kind of life-ending event for me.
[1207.82 → 1211.14] I basically was like, yeah, like, how does this work in the event of a succession?
[1211.14 → 1221.16] And, you know, there were, man, there were a lot of really, you know, to me, unexpected ways that people went with that.
[1221.32 → 1224.64] Like, oh, he's trying to make it, like, like, make us feel guilty.
[1224.84 → 1227.64] Or he's trying to distract from the real problem.
[1228.14 → 1229.68] Or he's trying to.
[1229.86 → 1230.90] If I tried to put on a hat.
[1230.90 → 1232.38] Or he doesn't understand how it works.
[1232.38 → 1240.32] If I tried to put on a hat of a strict viewer that didn't know you very well, I get it, though.
[1240.80 → 1241.74] Yeah, I get it, too.
[1241.82 → 1244.34] That's why I have these possible interpretations.
[1244.64 → 1245.42] Because I get it.
[1245.42 → 1245.56] No, totally.
[1245.66 → 1245.96] Yeah, yeah.
[1246.08 → 1250.22] And this has been pointed out by a few people that watching that, like, it was a live show.
[1250.30 → 1251.68] That was a guttural response.
[1251.68 → 1256.58] And you and me had actually had that exact conversation within the last, like, 24 hours.
[1256.78 → 1261.26] So I knew it was fresh on your mind, which is probably why it got regurgitated when the question was asked.
[1262.84 → 1268.56] So what I was really thinking about was that whatever commitment we make, it needs to outlive me.
[1268.58 → 1269.88] And it needs to be well-thought-out.
[1269.88 → 1275.80] It's my intention every, I talk about it all the time.
[1275.90 → 1281.68] It's my intention every year, every month, every week to make us more and more like a real company.
[1281.78 → 1282.84] I want to be a real company.
[1284.46 → 1288.40] And, you know, sometimes whether I'm ready or not, that sneaks up on me.
[1288.40 → 1306.22] So we went from selling some merch to our, you know, YouTube viewers to being an e-tail monster that suddenly pushed one-day revenue numbers that would have made the 200-person company I used to work for blush.
[1307.00 → 1310.84] Like, it was incredible what happened.
[1311.00 → 1314.46] And I wasn't entirely ready for it.
[1314.46 → 1321.34] And one of the things that is on my mind a lot, I mean, here's something, guys.
[1321.66 → 1324.98] Like, you know, yeah, I did that stream a few years ago, right?
[1325.08 → 1328.36] The 10 million subscriber stream where it was like, I'm thinking of retiring.
[1329.04 → 1331.20] Those thoughts didn't magically go away.
[1333.02 → 1337.50] It's not like everything that I was considering then.
[1337.56 → 1339.26] It's not like everything I was feeling then.
[1339.90 → 1344.44] You know, I made a video about it, pressed publish, and, oh, it's up.
[1344.46 → 1345.28] It's out of my mind now.
[1345.52 → 1347.42] I have no thoughts about this whatsoever.
[1349.42 → 1352.68] I think about it a lot.
[1353.32 → 1360.12] And I think the mistake that I made was that I was just, I was too open, honestly.
[1360.72 → 1362.80] And I'm not going to stop, to be very clear.
[1362.80 → 1369.14] But I think what I did was I let you guys into a thought process that I have and had.
[1369.70 → 1378.86] And that was, you know, hey, how do I ensure that, you know, whatever commitment I am making can be followed through on?
[1379.22 → 1382.76] How do I ensure that there is continuity?
[1382.76 → 1388.78] And, yeah, honestly, I probably went off the rails a little bit there.
[1389.26 → 1391.34] It's very unlikely to be a problem.
[1392.26 → 1402.78] But to the people who were saying, actually, they wouldn't have to deal with anything because, you know, if they decided they didn't want to rent it anymore, and they folded it up, it wouldn't be a concern if you have a warranty.
[1402.78 → 1404.26] And I'm like, yeah, that's exactly the problem.
[1406.00 → 1407.64] I don't want that to happen.
[1408.88 → 1409.78] Probably won't.
[1411.76 → 1418.04] But whatever commitment we make, I want to make sure that whether I am breathing or not, we're following through on it.
[1420.76 → 1423.60] There are ways to, I don't think that.
[1424.58 → 1425.14] There are ways.
[1425.20 → 1425.94] We just haven't done it.
[1425.94 → 1427.66] Exactly, which is the problem.
[1427.98 → 1428.06] Yeah.
[1428.40 → 1431.88] Because I think a lot of the complaints was that there just was no warranty.
[1432.36 → 1432.50] Yeah.
[1432.52 → 1438.08] So saying, like, warranty hard doesn't really excuse the fact that there wasn't one.
[1438.26 → 1439.48] And there are ways around it.
[1439.66 → 1442.26] And you can always, like, extend it later.
[1442.42 → 1446.78] So having at least something, I think, would have solved a lot of those problems.
[1447.24 → 1451.28] Like, I understand that, as I said, we had had the conversation before that show and all that kind of stuff.
[1451.28 → 1452.34] I understand those concerns.
[1452.44 → 1453.74] And I think they're coming from a good place.
[1454.06 → 1454.18] Yep.
[1454.18 → 1456.84] But, like, it just doesn't solve not having one at all.
[1458.88 → 1468.02] With everything said, I was obviously wrong about the importance of this issue with a large portion of our community.
[1468.40 → 1469.70] I should have been more clear.
[1469.84 → 1471.54] I should probably have a PR team.
[1472.16 → 1474.24] I probably shouldn't do this podcast.
[1474.82 → 1476.00] But I hate that stuff.
[1477.58 → 1479.04] CEO of Ford does a podcast.
[1479.04 → 1482.20] For better or for worse, you guys are getting my real thoughts.
[1482.20 → 1488.42] You know, I think I was pretty prickly in my response.
[1489.16 → 1493.18] I think the thing that really rubbed me the wrong way was people calling me a liar.
[1493.80 → 1499.16] I don't think it's unfair to say that anyone who's been following for a long time should probably know better.
[1499.62 → 1500.82] I don't always get it right.
[1501.30 → 1502.48] I really don't.
[1502.48 → 1505.56] I don't always express myself perfectly at the moment.
[1506.30 → 1507.40] But I shoot straight.
[1508.26 → 1510.78] What you hear is what you get for better or for worse.
[1510.94 → 1512.78] And I'm always trying to improve.
[1513.04 → 1515.52] I get things wrong all the time.
[1515.94 → 1518.60] But I like to think I don't get them wrong three times in a row.
[1518.74 → 1519.82] If you kind of get what I mean.
[1520.18 → 1521.74] I'm saying I might get them wrong twice.
[1521.74 → 1526.92] But very rarely three times in a row.
[1527.90 → 1528.86] Maybe sometimes.
[1529.06 → 1529.46] But rarely.
[1530.56 → 1534.90] Another thing that probably came across wrong, since we're piling on things that I did wrong.
[1536.00 → 1537.58] That's me piling on, so I guess I'm allowed.
[1538.16 → 1543.10] Is me saying this is basically a professional outrage storm and not reflective of the community at large.
[1543.10 → 1543.92] Who knows what I'm about?
[1543.92 → 1546.54] What I said was true.
[1546.88 → 1548.90] We didn't actually have a ton of cancellations.
[1548.98 → 1552.66] And we did have a ton of people reaching out saying, actually, I've had great experiences.
[1552.84 → 1553.84] I trust them completely.
[1554.60 → 1562.16] But for everyone else, it was probably extremely crappy to hear me be dismissive of the concerns of their fellow enthusiasts.
[1562.16 → 1569.72] I think also, while there might not have been a ton of cancellations, there are potentially people that would have ordered that didn't because of that.
[1569.84 → 1570.40] And that's fair.
[1570.40 → 1575.52] But again, my mindset was, we'll deal with this.
[1575.96 → 1577.38] There's no particular hurry.
[1577.76 → 1578.50] We got this.
[1579.06 → 1581.00] Nobody has been screwed over.
[1581.54 → 1585.52] No consumer, no viewer was actually screwed over.
[1586.96 → 1588.36] So, all right.
[1588.56 → 1589.32] We'll deal with it whenever.
[1589.98 → 1590.62] But you guys are right.
[1590.78 → 1594.22] I would raise an eyebrow if a company didn't have a formal warranty.
[1594.22 → 1599.10] But, you know, and this comes back to what I was saying before.
[1600.18 → 1604.92] The bigger issue than the actual written policy is the behaviour of the company.
[1604.92 → 1607.44] Because at the end of the day, this is all going to come down to trust.
[1608.08 → 1608.86] Even if you have.
[1608.94 → 1609.30] Yeah, go ahead.
[1609.56 → 1610.50] So, I agree.
[1611.38 → 1612.42] But that doesn't.
[1612.54 → 1612.86] It's still.
[1613.14 → 1613.80] We got to.
[1613.96 → 1615.32] I have to keep stating this.
[1615.48 → 1615.98] Yeah, that's fine.
[1616.00 → 1618.00] I know that someone's going to jump partway into the show.
[1618.00 → 1620.70] But I know you understand.
[1620.84 → 1623.98] But I'm just saying it again because of how viewers watch things.
[1625.02 → 1625.64] But having this.
[1625.90 → 1628.24] Being like a strong internal policy is more important.
[1628.64 → 1629.52] Is good.
[1629.64 → 1634.58] But it doesn't dismiss not having an acceptable public policy.
[1634.76 → 1634.96] Yep.
[1635.62 → 1636.62] Or external policy.
[1636.76 → 1638.46] So, let's say you have a written policy.
[1638.92 → 1647.72] There are lots of ways that companies with written policies can just completely avoid dealing with the cost of a warranty replacement.
[1648.00 → 1652.16] They can weasel out of it through terms and conditions in their written warranty policy.
[1652.26 → 1657.58] If for whatever reason they feel it's not worth it, or they just don't feel like it.
[1657.90 → 1658.74] They can fold out right.
[1658.96 → 1659.38] Also just dressing things.
[1659.48 → 1660.02] Which happens.
[1660.42 → 1662.18] And that's something that, you know, yeah.
[1662.18 → 1668.36] I think any business owner who's not anxious right now is deluded.
[1669.06 → 1672.94] Like we are heading into an unprecedented time right now.
[1673.30 → 1676.90] We're on the cusp of potentially a global recession right now.
[1676.90 → 1681.12] If you're a business owner who's not a little anxious right now, you got to like to read the news.
[1681.44 → 1682.28] Like for realties.
[1682.82 → 1682.92] Yeah.
[1683.58 → 1686.28] Then there's just like outright refusing to honour it.
[1686.44 → 1687.56] Just like ghosting people.
[1688.14 → 1689.28] So, what are you going to do?
[1689.62 → 1693.80] Someone ghosts you over your phone warranty or your mouse warranty.
[1694.50 → 1695.28] What do you do?
[1695.92 → 1697.04] Well, you have to take them to court.
[1697.12 → 1698.38] Are you really going to do that?
[1698.84 → 1700.16] Over a couple of hundred dollars?
[1700.28 → 1702.06] Do you have any idea how much time that takes?
[1702.08 → 1703.02] How much that's going to cost?
[1703.14 → 1705.18] Some people might, but not the average person.
[1705.18 → 1711.24] So, at the end of the day, as someone who has seen both sides of all of those coins.
[1711.40 → 1712.78] Like working as a product manager.
[1713.04 → 1715.32] Where you are this in between, right?
[1716.28 → 1722.68] On the one hand, you're working at this company who has their own policies and their own actual behaviour.
[1723.18 → 1724.66] Which don't always align.
[1725.00 → 1726.36] And your customer facing that way.
[1726.36 → 1728.70] And then you work with all these manufacturers.
[1728.94 → 1731.56] You work with all these brands or distributors or whatever else.
[1731.70 → 1734.46] Who also have their policies.
[1735.04 → 1738.22] And in addition to their policies, the way that they actually behave.
[1738.72 → 1742.52] And so, for me, reputation is everything.
[1743.22 → 1744.58] Like, yes.
[1744.78 → 1745.00] Yes.
[1745.14 → 1745.34] Yes.
[1745.48 → 1745.86] Yes.
[1746.14 → 1746.98] Warranty matters.
[1746.98 → 1752.44] It's a written version of what you would like, I believe, in an ideal world.
[1752.62 → 1754.04] Your reputation to be.
[1755.12 → 1755.98] But it's...
[1756.84 → 1760.08] The writing doesn't always match up with the real world.
[1760.70 → 1760.98] And there's stuff...
[1761.70 → 1763.12] So, I hear you on that.
[1763.28 → 1766.98] But at the same time, what if someone...
[1766.98 → 1772.66] What if the first video someone ever saw with you in it was the short circuit of the backpack?
[1772.66 → 1774.50] Because they were looking to buy a backpack.
[1774.84 → 1777.86] And they were like, hey, that's a cool backpack.
[1778.16 → 1780.42] You keep getting into stuff that I'm about to talk about.
[1780.50 → 1781.28] You're so good at it.
[1781.40 → 1783.02] I'm driving the conversation forward.
[1783.04 → 1786.20] It's almost like I had a bit of a flow to what I was going to talk about.
[1786.38 → 1786.94] And you're ready.
[1788.52 → 1791.02] So, I felt our reputation spoke for itself.
[1791.20 → 1791.98] Was that hubris?
[1794.46 → 1795.06] Go ahead.
[1795.18 → 1795.60] Just do it.
[1795.64 → 1795.86] Yes.
[1796.04 → 1796.32] Okay.
[1797.00 → 1801.72] I assumed that the people I was talking to had, like, ordered from us.
[1801.72 → 1804.00] That they had already seen the quality and service.
[1804.20 → 1807.10] That it wasn't going to be a major issue.
[1807.38 → 1808.18] I was clearly wrong.
[1808.48 → 1809.74] That was clearly my bad.
[1810.30 → 1814.72] I also assumed that the community wouldn't jump straight to how anti-consumer I am.
[1816.84 → 1817.96] This is hilarious.
[1818.08 → 1826.16] I had some stuff in here about discussing how a lot of the community went straight to Steve's seven-year warranty on his screwdriver.
[1826.74 → 1827.80] He has since made a video.
[1827.94 → 1828.88] I haven't watched it yet.
[1828.88 → 1834.88] But, frankly, I probably won't because the summary that I've gotten already is that he made it based on out-of-date information.
[1835.08 → 1835.82] So, that's unfortunate.
[1836.56 → 1839.74] But maybe he'll get around to covering it again after this.
[1839.76 → 1841.50] It wasn't out-of-date when he made it, to be fair.
[1841.50 → 1843.94] There were tweets clarifying stuff that he didn't cover.
[1844.26 → 1844.92] So, yeah.
[1844.98 → 1847.20] I mean, you can't be expected to read every tweet.
[1847.32 → 1847.74] It's not reasonable.
[1847.74 → 1850.32] There was a lot of talking from you boys.
[1850.34 → 1851.24] So, it's not reasonable.
[1851.78 → 1854.94] But, basically, what I said was, you know, I love Steve.
[1855.02 → 1856.26] He's a force for good in the industry.
[1856.78 → 1866.52] But to imagine that the seven-year warranty on his screwdriver is any better than his will to follow up on it is imaginary.
[1866.52 → 1868.68] He will follow up on it.
[1868.70 → 1869.38] I believe he will.
[1869.44 → 1870.38] He's a principled guy.
[1870.94 → 1877.50] And, honestly, I think that if a shaft fell out of his screwdriver in eight years, he'd probably replace it.
[1878.38 → 1880.10] Assuming he's still around doing this gig.
[1880.24 → 1882.06] And I think that because he's a stand-up guy.
[1882.20 → 1883.74] But that's the assumption.
[1884.02 → 1886.08] It's that he's still doing this gig.
[1886.08 → 1890.62] So, it ultimately comes down to trust, no matter what.
[1890.68 → 1893.52] And I thought you guys saw me the same way, which was kind of heartbreaking, actually.
[1894.58 → 1896.02] But also eye-opening.
[1896.60 → 1903.92] The number of people out there who will assume the worst of me just because I let you into my very real and, yes, sometimes flawed thought processes.
[1903.92 → 1905.82] I don't think you're necessarily reading this the right way.
[1906.10 → 1908.70] I don't think it necessarily means that people don't trust you.
[1908.70 → 1912.76] I think that a lot of people go with the stance of trust but verify.
[1912.76 → 1917.60] And to verify in this situation would be to have a warranty that they can look at.
[1917.60 → 1921.74] There was a lot of else.
[1921.96 → 1923.50] I'm sure there was as well.
[1923.58 → 1925.22] But I think that would be a disproportionate.
[1925.40 → 1928.16] We've talked before about vocal minorities and stuff.
[1928.44 → 1930.48] I don't think it's a huge proportion of the audience.
[1930.78 → 1932.20] There is always going to be.
[1932.52 → 1934.38] We're big enough now, and you're the front.
[1934.54 → 1939.58] So, there will always be a certain amount of people with daggers ready to go, literally, no matter what the topic is.
[1939.58 → 1940.32] Well, it's frustrating.
[1940.68 → 1941.12] For sure.
[1941.12 → 1941.58] It's frustrating.
[1941.58 → 1945.10] And, again, I know because I see the numbers.
[1945.82 → 1949.54] The majority of you are like, yeah, he's got this.
[1950.04 → 1950.96] And I know that.
[1951.50 → 1956.44] But you read 100 comments on a video.
[1956.84 → 1958.36] Which is the one that stands out?
[1958.48 → 1959.04] The negative one.
[1959.44 → 1963.62] My English teacher in grade 9 told me this.
[1963.72 → 1969.36] I don't even know how the topic came up, but it was about how it takes – and this math is obviously whatever.
[1970.04 → 1970.80] English math.
[1970.80 → 1971.36] Yeah.
[1971.36 → 1971.92] Yeah, exactly.
[1971.92 → 1972.08] Arts math.
[1972.32 → 1972.46] Yeah.
[1972.64 → 1972.78] Okay.
[1973.12 → 1973.78] Fair enough.
[1973.78 → 1978.42] But it was – for every negative comment, it takes 10 or 100 or something.
[1978.48 → 1979.12] I don't remember what she said.
[1979.72 → 1982.60] Positive comments to make you, like, forget the negative comment.
[1982.66 → 1982.80] Right.
[1982.80 → 1984.64] It's the same situation here.
[1984.64 → 1986.88] It's not exactly the context that she was talking about.
[1986.88 → 1990.52] But, like, I don't think trust is that big of a problem.
[1990.64 → 1992.08] I don't think it's a problem at all, actually.
[1992.18 → 1992.26] Okay.
[1992.30 → 1992.88] Yes and no.
[1992.96 → 1994.58] Because you had –
[1994.58 → 1995.28] It's the verify stage.
[1995.28 → 1999.64] The mods of the Subreddit consolidated the warranty hurricane into a mega thread, right?
[1999.64 → 2002.46] And I was accused of censoring discussion around it.
[2002.46 → 2003.82] People thought it was the –
[2003.82 → 2011.70] Which I was extremely, honestly, like – I was more personally upset by that than I should have been.
[2011.88 → 2013.56] A lot of people in the comments on that.
[2013.56 → 2018.32] That censor negative or critical posts about me.
[2018.56 → 2024.10] Our stance from the beginning of the forum, which, just in case you didn't know, is the beginning of the company.
[2024.60 → 2031.28] It was just formalized because of the forum, is that we would remove inflammatory comments about other people.
[2031.52 → 2031.88] Users.
[2032.14 → 2032.42] Users.
[2032.42 → 2033.42] Our users, our community.
[2033.42 → 2036.06] But we would not remove inflammatory comments about us.
[2036.10 → 2036.96] We are fair game.
[2037.30 → 2037.46] Yeah.
[2037.52 → 2040.30] And that has always, always been the policy.
[2040.30 → 2045.06] And I was just – I was looking at it going, when have I ever done that?
[2045.54 → 2050.20] And then – and then it kind of gets worse because I explained we have staff.
[2050.70 → 2057.18] We do have people who are on staff as moderators on the unofficial Subreddit, r slash Linus Tech Tips.
[2057.70 → 2058.84] That's there for emergencies.
[2059.36 → 2061.42] The example that I used was doxing.
[2061.82 → 2063.76] I was outright called a liar over this.
[2063.76 → 2071.34] Even after the creator of the Subreddit came out, said, hey, look, I checked the logs.
[2071.74 → 2073.80] They didn't touch a single thing.
[2074.16 → 2074.60] It was kind of funny.
[2074.60 → 2075.86] Well, then the goalposts moved.
[2076.20 → 2083.22] And now it was unethical for us to have staff moderators on an unofficial Subreddit, even if we weren't going to touch anything.
[2083.98 → 2085.86] And I just – I don't know what to say.
[2086.26 → 2087.54] I wasn't lying.
[2087.54 → 2098.44] Stuff happens in a community this size at our scale, whether it's doxing or whether it's – maybe I didn't want to tell you exactly what kind of problems they are.
[2098.66 → 2098.86] Right?
[2099.16 → 2100.10] That's a possibility.
[2101.10 → 2102.98] Whatever it is, stuff happens.
[2103.10 → 2104.06] And there's a huge difference.
[2104.16 → 2107.06] Like, honestly, the moderators there, they do a great job, but they're volunteers.
[2107.64 → 2113.48] I can't call them in the middle of the night on a Saturday because something's like an emergency.
[2113.48 → 2117.04] There's a big difference between acting fast and acting now.
[2117.04 → 2119.72] Some of the old school forum mods are like, wait, you wouldn't do that?
[2119.74 → 2121.00] Because I used to bug people like that.
[2121.18 → 2121.70] I don't.
[2121.84 → 2122.04] Sorry.
[2122.36 → 2122.64] Sorry.
[2122.86 → 2123.12] Okay.
[2123.20 → 2123.52] Anyway.
[2126.16 → 2127.06] So, yeah.
[2127.14 → 2128.96] I need someone on payroll that I can call.
[2129.04 → 2129.70] It's that simple.
[2130.00 → 2132.58] And it's not because someone said something mean about me.
[2132.68 → 2138.08] Like, if we were moderating the discussion, you don't think we would have just blocked the word warranty and called it a day?
[2138.36 → 2138.72] Sick.
[2138.84 → 2140.08] That would have been pretty simple, right?
[2140.40 → 2141.06] Let's go.
[2141.06 → 2143.48] So, you know, if it makes you uncomfortable, I'm sorry.
[2143.90 → 2146.04] But safety comes first.
[2147.04 → 2149.64] And if you don't believe me, then okay.
[2149.96 → 2153.20] Like, there's really nothing else that I can say about it.
[2153.20 → 2160.28] Now we get to the part where I was like, come on, guys.
[2160.32 → 2160.52] Really?
[2160.92 → 2168.90] I think the WAN show viewers, I think the people watching this probably understand that whole guy who drops everything and has 50 people to do all the hard stuff for him.
[2168.98 → 2170.26] Hashtag lie-ness.
[2170.26 → 2178.38] I think you understand that that bit is an excellent way for us to make topics more approachable and to create a safe environment for people to make mistakes and learn.
[2178.38 → 2181.80] I could absolutely polish everything.
[2182.28 → 2185.84] There is no reason whatsoever that I ever have to make a mistake on camera.
[2185.94 → 2186.62] Think about it, right?
[2186.70 → 2187.16] We edit.
[2187.66 → 2188.46] Other than WAN show.
[2188.54 → 2190.24] I can make lots of mistakes on WAN show, which I do.
[2190.76 → 2193.58] But I also make mistakes in our pre-recorded videos.
[2195.58 → 2197.02] There's a reason.
[2197.80 → 2198.48] There's a reason.
[2198.48 → 2205.40] I also would like to think that you guys know that the success over here is not some kind of random accident.
[2205.60 → 2206.28] I did get lucky.
[2206.64 → 2208.10] I was in the right place at the right time.
[2208.18 → 2208.92] But I know what I'm doing.
[2209.08 → 2211.36] Even if, even if, so here's the thing.
[2211.70 → 2213.20] I'm not an idiot.
[2214.08 → 2227.72] Even if I didn't care about any of you, not even a little, don't you think I'm smart enough to know that if we denied any reasonable warranty claim or support claim,
[2227.72 → 2229.40] there'd be rioting?
[2230.20 → 2233.34] Do you honestly think I'm that stupid?
[2236.04 → 2237.38] Even if I didn't.
[2237.50 → 2238.58] I have to come back.
[2238.68 → 2243.84] Yeah, even if I didn't want our policy to be bend over backwards for everybody.
[2244.16 → 2244.78] I have to.
[2244.78 → 2248.38] Would I be, would I be, would I be deranged enough?
[2248.56 → 2249.56] I have to bring it back.
[2249.60 → 2249.96] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2249.96 → 2254.70] But what about that person who just watched the there's got to be one of them.
[2255.10 → 2257.60] The first video they ever watched was the short circuit backpack video.
[2257.60 → 2258.56] They have no idea who you are.
[2258.66 → 2259.98] They were shopping for a backpack.
[2260.68 → 2261.80] They found that video.
[2263.08 → 2264.86] What if this is a brand-new viewer?
[2265.04 → 2266.82] They don't, they don't have that stuff established.
[2267.04 → 2269.22] And they, and people should be able to, yes.
[2269.32 → 2269.60] Okay.
[2269.62 → 2270.60] Well then we're good.
[2270.84 → 2276.24] I know, but I just, every, every time you go down that road, I got, I got to bring it back, which, and I understand why you are.
[2276.24 → 2276.98] And I get it.
[2276.98 → 2277.86] And I think it's good.
[2277.86 → 2279.92] And you should, you should do this, et cetera.
[2279.92 → 2282.84] But I have to, I have to keep jumping in there.
[2282.92 → 2283.98] So I have a summary thing.
[2284.36 → 2284.72] Okay.
[2284.72 → 2284.88] Okay.
[2284.88 → 2287.04] Thank you, Luke, for helpfully getting ahead of me again.
[2287.16 → 2287.28] Yeah.
[2287.34 → 2287.50] Yeah.
[2287.58 → 2287.86] No problem.
[2287.86 → 2289.96] I think most of you understand my jam over here.
[2290.06 → 2292.48] I just didn't realize how many of you would jump on me.
[2292.92 → 2295.56] Not even due to this, due to some past grievance.
[2295.68 → 2302.20] The, the speed with which both the main forum thread and the main backpack thread before they were consolidated.
[2302.20 → 2310.62] The speed with which they pivoted to, remember when he said ad block is tantamount to privacy, was incredible.
[2310.76 → 2313.96] Well, this is, this is like I said, there's people sitting there with daggers ready to go about anything.
[2314.10 → 2316.34] And then they're going to want to turn it into the thing that they actually care about.
[2316.52 → 2318.02] So that, I mean, that makes sense to me.
[2318.08 → 2318.40] And.
[2318.58 → 2319.04] That's a.
[2319.04 → 2319.86] I get it.
[2320.96 → 2322.32] That bottom line is fair enough.
[2323.78 → 2326.78] Skepticism is absolutely something that me.
[2327.06 → 2327.48] We've praised it.
[2327.48 → 2328.32] We probably need more of.
[2328.38 → 2329.18] We say it's a good thing.
[2329.62 → 2330.48] Corpse aren't your friends.
[2330.74 → 2331.68] Influencers aren't your friends.
[2331.82 → 2333.10] I happen to be both of those things.
[2333.28 → 2334.14] Corps influencer.
[2334.40 → 2334.74] Great.
[2335.64 → 2337.48] So for the people posting that, fair enough.
[2337.74 → 2339.74] But even if I'm not your friend, I'm not stupid.
[2340.16 → 2342.40] To those of you who think I'm some kind of lucky idiot.
[2343.50 → 2344.38] Hey, thanks for that.
[2344.38 → 2346.76] But I, I really don't think so.
[2346.86 → 2347.66] I'm not a genius.
[2348.12 → 2349.42] My mother had me tested.
[2349.86 → 2353.20] I'm definitely not a genius, but I'm super-duper not an idiot either.
[2353.20 → 2353.28] Sorry.
[2355.24 → 2360.08] So yeah, we didn't, we didn't actually screw over a single customer and look at what we
[2360.08 → 2360.68] got this week.
[2360.78 → 2365.40] I know, I know what would happen if we actually boned anyone.
[2365.84 → 2366.54] For real.
[2366.80 → 2369.58] Like it would, it would go, it would go mega viral.
[2370.26 → 2371.14] I don't, I don't think.
[2371.38 → 2372.64] So I hear you.
[2372.76 → 2373.48] I get that.
[2373.68 → 2373.92] Yep.
[2374.34 → 2375.02] I know.
[2375.06 → 2375.38] I know.
[2375.44 → 2375.66] I know.
[2375.70 → 2377.24] What if it was the first thing they ever saw?
[2377.52 → 2377.74] I know.
[2377.82 → 2380.16] I don't think that's the point.
[2380.26 → 2382.48] You haven't had an not, I'm not saying you would.
[2382.48 → 2387.38] I know the internal policies, but there has been no opportunity to do so.
[2387.62 → 2389.98] So saying that we haven't does really have any value.
[2390.66 → 2390.78] Sure.
[2391.02 → 2391.90] But we also haven't.
[2391.96 → 2392.84] We have lots of other products.
[2392.98 → 2393.00] Sure.
[2393.10 → 2395.02] But we're talking, we've had four years.
[2395.04 → 2398.40] We don't have any other products that are in this category in regard to premium nature.
[2398.62 → 2399.60] I, yeah.
[2399.60 → 2402.52] We don't have any other products that like, say there was, say there was a fundamental
[2402.52 → 2402.84] flaw.
[2402.88 → 2403.74] We have a hundred dollar hoodie.
[2404.02 → 2405.46] The bottom just falls off.
[2405.54 → 2406.02] Actually, yeah.
[2406.06 → 2407.40] Swag, it's well over a hundred dollars.
[2407.54 → 2407.74] Sure.
[2407.98 → 2409.44] Say there's a fundamental flaw with this one.
[2410.08 → 2410.28] Right.
[2410.80 → 2411.66] There isn't.
[2411.66 → 2411.94] Whatever.
[2411.94 → 2412.02] Whatever.
[2412.40 → 2413.12] But say there is.
[2413.42 → 2413.68] Sure.
[2415.26 → 2417.50] Someone from the outside and like, yes, you know what?
[2417.52 → 2417.88] They're wrong.
[2417.96 → 2418.12] Okay.
[2418.14 → 2418.36] Whatever.
[2418.44 → 2419.68] We can stomach backpack problems.
[2419.98 → 2420.46] It's fine.
[2420.48 → 2420.58] Yeah.
[2420.58 → 2420.98] We got this.
[2421.04 → 2421.22] Don't worry.
[2421.24 → 2422.04] But they don't know that.
[2422.36 → 2422.72] All right.
[2422.82 → 2425.94] So without these things being in place, I can totally understand the skepticism.
[2426.10 → 2428.52] I can totally understand the frustration, all that type of stuff.
[2428.94 → 2434.60] I, it might've been volume boosted pretty darn high, but then I think a lot of that was
[2434.60 → 2436.76] our horrific response to it.
[2436.88 → 2437.20] Yes.
[2437.20 → 2438.14] And I think we just got to.
[2438.14 → 2439.94] Thank you for charitably using the word our.
[2440.82 → 2441.18] Yeah.
[2441.18 → 2442.30] I appreciate that.
[2442.36 → 2443.34] I'm throwing myself in here.
[2443.92 → 2449.60] So bottom line, here's our plan for the trust me, bro guarantee of quality.
[2449.60 → 2455.36] We are, we will be offering a limited lifetime warranty guarantee guaranteeing no manufacturing
[2455.36 → 2455.92] defects.
[2456.34 → 2460.12] These will lead to replacement or repair at our discretion in accordance with local law.
[2460.24 → 2466.08] It does not cover misuse, neglect, user modification, or intentional damage, obviously, nor does it cover
[2466.08 → 2467.30] normal wear and tear.
[2467.30 → 2472.74] We will, we will, we're going to get all this drawn up in legal terms that will, you know,
[2472.76 → 2475.58] obviously cover our butt in like any actual warranty.
[2475.72 → 2476.56] Look closely at them.
[2476.64 → 2481.64] They basically amount to the will of whoever it is to fulfill them.
[2481.64 → 2483.98] And I have a lot of will to fulfill them.
[2483.98 → 2489.86] I do not wish to have a poo storm on my hands because like over what a couple of hundred dollars,
[2490.06 → 2490.34] honestly.
[2490.92 → 2495.06] Even if it was all the backpacks, I wouldn't, I wouldn't tarnish our brand that way.
[2495.14 → 2495.68] It's not worth it.
[2495.72 → 2496.48] It's not worth it.
[2496.68 → 2500.46] Like genuinely just in a, in a like raw, brutal financial sense.
[2500.54 → 2502.16] It's even then it's not worth it.
[2502.16 → 2504.34] Without our community, we're nothing.
[2504.44 → 2505.66] I've said it time and time again.
[2505.86 → 2509.62] If this is the first video you're watching, which Luke says is a possibility, he's right.
[2513.72 → 2514.28] That's it.
[2514.86 → 2515.74] That's the bottom line.
[2516.12 → 2517.76] Which chat is blowing up with first time messengers?
[2518.28 → 2522.74] In the meantime, while we get all that drawn up in a way that my lawyer doesn't yell at me,
[2523.18 → 2523.80] nothing changes.
[2524.20 → 2528.94] Our 100% local, not outsourced support, they might be a little slow sometimes,
[2529.06 → 2531.58] but they will take care of you.
[2531.58 → 2533.32] And if they don't, then Nicker, I will.
[2533.58 → 2534.18] It's that simple.
[2534.60 → 2537.20] You either believe that I have the integrity to follow through on my word,
[2537.28 → 2539.86] or at the very least that I'm not enough of an idiot to break it.
[2540.40 → 2541.20] Or you don't.
[2541.30 → 2542.06] I can't make you.
[2542.46 → 2544.12] All I can do is keep doing my thing.
[2544.40 → 2546.84] And eventually you guys will come around.
[2547.16 → 2547.96] So that's it.
[2548.34 → 2552.36] The trust me, bro, guarantee of quality, which I'm going to be pushing hard to make sure we call it that.
[2557.02 → 2558.48] Oh, I don't think you should.
[2558.82 → 2559.74] I don't think you should.
[2559.78 → 2560.30] Oh, I'm doing it.
[2560.30 → 2561.22] I know I moved away from the mic.
[2561.22 → 2567.62] I don't think you should because when this goes away, and you're stuck with that naming in eight years from now,
[2568.52 → 2572.60] it's just going to be weird and bring this back up for no reason.
[2573.30 → 2574.34] I'll think about it.
[2574.64 → 2576.40] I will take your feedback.
[2576.74 → 2579.60] Maybe just do an acronym and don't explain it to anyone.
[2579.78 → 2581.20] The TMB guarantee of quality?
[2581.30 → 2581.42] The TMB guarantee.
[2581.88 → 2582.10] All right.
[2582.24 → 2583.58] I could come around to that.
[2583.80 → 2585.46] Just no explainer.
[2585.46 → 2589.08] shbingo on Twitch asks, can we define normal wear and tear?
[2589.18 → 2590.88] With all due respect, it's an expensive bag.
[2590.94 → 2594.20] And while we know your quality, I'd hope it would hold up for a number of years.
[2594.68 → 2596.34] Well, that's exactly it.
[2597.28 → 2599.26] That's how warranties are structured.
[2599.66 → 2601.76] Like, go, go, like, go read them.
[2602.26 → 2604.18] It's usually at the discretion.
[2604.28 → 2604.68] Not usually.
[2604.68 → 2610.12] It's basically always at the discretion of the manufacturer if you have done anything that voids your warranty.
[2610.42 → 2612.12] So it comes down to trusting me.
[2612.44 → 2613.50] And yeah, we got your back.
[2614.34 → 2615.06] Of course.
[2615.18 → 2616.50] Just like we always have.
[2616.58 → 2617.34] That's my point.
[2617.60 → 2623.78] Is that whatever warranty we write down, it ultimately comes down to our will to fulfill it.
[2623.84 → 2624.54] And we have a lot.
[2625.80 → 2626.50] Full will.
[2627.40 → 2628.58] No limit to the will.
[2629.58 → 2630.10] Sort of.
[2630.94 → 2632.04] Someone could sue you.
[2632.72 → 2634.64] And at that point, it doesn't just come down to your will.
[2634.66 → 2635.50] Well, why would they sue me?
[2636.32 → 2637.26] Well, what if you didn't?
[2637.72 → 2638.62] Well, why would we do that?
[2638.68 → 2638.98] That's stupid.
[2639.12 → 2639.60] No, I know.
[2639.94 → 2641.70] But you're saying it just comes down to that.
[2641.78 → 2643.54] And technically, it doesn't just come down to that.
[2644.62 → 2645.28] Oh, I see.
[2645.32 → 2645.54] Okay.
[2645.62 → 2645.92] Yeah, yeah.
[2645.92 → 2646.42] I see what you mean.
[2646.50 → 2646.66] Sorry.
[2646.72 → 2648.62] There is no reality where we don't just cover it.
[2648.62 → 2648.88] No, I know.
[2649.00 → 2650.04] I totally agree.
[2650.60 → 2652.24] Yes, technically, they could sue me.
[2652.32 → 2653.16] Yes, they could.
[2653.36 → 2653.50] Yeah.
[2653.64 → 2656.80] I'm just saying, when you say it just comes down to this, it only comes down to this.
[2656.88 → 2658.22] And it's like, well, no, not technically.
[2658.22 → 2662.36] It will only because we're going to honour this very highly.
[2663.06 → 2664.80] But, you know.
[2664.88 → 2670.26] But just like any other warranty, ours will be worded in such a way that it would be very difficult to take it to court anyway.
[2670.36 → 2671.02] Because we're, probably.
[2671.28 → 2671.76] But they could.
[2671.90 → 2673.28] Just going to copy someone else's.
[2674.40 → 2674.84] Sorry.
[2675.30 → 2676.96] We will have a lawyer look at it.
[2677.04 → 2679.24] But, like, someone else did the work already.
[2679.72 → 2681.62] I mean, a lot of legal documentation is.
[2681.72 → 2682.40] I know.
[2682.64 → 2682.84] Just.
[2682.84 → 2683.12] Just.
[2683.64 → 2684.26] So, anyway.
[2684.38 → 2690.94] With all that in mind, we have a special edition shirt created by the one and only Sarah Butt.
[2691.44 → 2694.10] The Trust Me Bro Warranty T-shirt.
[2694.38 → 2694.74] Okay.
[2694.88 → 2699.02] I spent an embarrassing amount of time verifying that this was actually our website.
[2699.02 → 2702.76] Because the first time I ever saw this, someone posted it in a float plane chat.
[2702.88 → 2704.78] And I was like, you must be kidding me.
[2705.00 → 2707.50] There's no way we're actually releasing this.
[2707.80 → 2708.38] We are.
[2708.38 → 2710.36] And it's our website.
[2711.00 → 2712.38] It's definitely it.
[2712.50 → 2713.26] It's real.
[2713.52 → 2714.42] It's a pre-sale.
[2714.50 → 2715.40] This isn't a spoof.
[2715.52 → 2720.20] All shirts will be printed following purchase and may take three to four weeks to print and ship.
[2722.08 → 2723.98] All order items will be shipped together.
[2724.12 → 2729.14] This is not like backpack where your initial items will ship now, and then your backpack will ship later.
[2729.48 → 2730.08] Unless you also buy a backpack.
[2730.40 → 2732.24] Oh, unless you also buy a backpack.
[2732.24 → 2736.46] In which case your other items will ship together but, like, delayed by this shirt.
[2736.64 → 2737.84] And then the backpack will ship later.
[2737.84 → 2739.38] Unless the backpack comes in first.
[2739.46 → 2740.42] It depends which wave you're on.
[2741.14 → 2741.54] Okay.
[2741.70 → 2741.92] No.
[2742.06 → 2742.56] Probably not.
[2742.68 → 2742.76] No.
[2742.80 → 2743.52] I don't think that'll happen.
[2744.56 → 2745.76] But there it is, guys.
[2746.08 → 2747.34] The Trust Me Bro warranty.
[2747.52 → 2749.20] I think she did an amazing job.
[2749.28 → 2750.84] It actually looks perfect.
[2751.36 → 2752.38] It does look pretty good.
[2752.60 → 2752.92] It looks so good.
[2752.92 → 2755.12] I still don't know if we should have done it.
[2755.20 → 2756.08] But it does look pretty good.
[2756.08 → 2757.34] Oh, of course we shouldn't have done it.
[2757.40 → 2762.12] We should be a mature company that does the right, you know, responsible PR thing.
[2762.12 → 2763.08] You know, not only.
[2763.40 → 2763.56] Look, man.
[2764.06 → 2764.24] Yeah.
[2764.38 → 2765.90] Not is always what I meant to say.
[2765.90 → 2771.86] But, you know, when we're getting destroyed and we, up until hopefully now, responded very poorly.
[2772.48 → 2773.36] You know, maybe.
[2773.60 → 2774.06] I don't know.
[2775.06 → 2776.32] I like the pink one.
[2779.70 → 2780.52] Look, guys.
[2780.66 → 2782.24] I have to have some fun.
[2782.34 → 2783.78] I have to have fun.
[2784.02 → 2784.96] I have to have fun with this.
[2785.04 → 2785.96] These are our shirts, right?
[2786.00 → 2787.08] I want to see the burgundy one.
[2787.24 → 2788.50] I normally really like that colour.
[2788.58 → 2790.04] But I haven't seen our shirts in burgundy yet.
[2790.16 → 2790.80] Oh, yeah.
[2791.32 → 2792.24] Well, I don't know.
[2792.62 → 2793.14] Request one.
[2793.28 → 2793.64] Yeah, yeah.
[2793.64 → 2794.26] Request one.
[2794.34 → 2794.80] Wear it for when.
[2794.86 → 2795.92] I don't know if I'm going to wear a Trust Me Bro T-shirt.
[2795.92 → 2797.98] You don't know if you're going to wear the Trust Me Bro T-shirt?
[2798.08 → 2798.58] Maybe not.
[2798.74 → 2799.16] Ooh, guys.
[2799.50 → 2800.18] I have a bit of news.
[2800.56 → 2800.78] Okay.
[2800.82 → 2803.64] There's only 19 bags left in Wave 2.
[2803.74 → 2805.56] There's only 19 bags in Wave 2.
[2805.68 → 2807.64] Hey, thanks, Anonymous, for taking number 20 there.
[2807.70 → 2810.44] That looked like a backpack order on the monitor thing.
[2810.48 → 2811.28] Oh, there's a lot of those.
[2811.28 → 2816.92] Yeah, so the bottom line is, guys, we got you.
[2817.74 → 2822.32] And I promise we're going to get into some tech discussions at some point here.
[2822.66 → 2824.90] But I've got another.
[2825.42 → 2826.20] I've got another.
[2826.34 → 2827.92] This is a much smaller storm.
[2828.28 → 2830.30] But it's a much more serious storm.
[2830.66 → 2833.20] And so it's pretty important to me.
[2833.56 → 2833.86] Okay.
[2834.02 → 2835.04] There's still some confusion.
[2835.56 → 2836.30] Oh, there's confusion?
[2836.38 → 2837.96] We are putting it in writing.
[2838.56 → 2838.78] Yeah.
[2838.78 → 2841.40] Sorry, I was previously responding to some people on Flow plane Chat.
[2841.48 → 2842.68] They're like, you have to put it in writing.
[2842.78 → 2842.96] We are.
[2842.98 → 2843.50] It's happening.
[2843.80 → 2845.00] He literally read it out.
[2845.30 → 2845.54] Yeah.
[2845.86 → 2846.30] It's coming.
[2846.70 → 2848.30] And in the meantime, nothing changes.
[2848.58 → 2848.90] It's coming.
[2848.90 → 2849.48] We'll deal with it.
[2849.56 → 2849.76] Yeah.
[2850.22 → 2850.76] We'll deal with it.
[2850.78 → 2852.08] There's a warranty on the way.
[2852.22 → 2853.20] There's a bunch of confusion.
[2853.30 → 2856.86] I think people are thinking that this whole conversation was an excuse to not do it.
[2857.16 → 2857.52] No.
[2857.98 → 2859.74] It was a mistake to not do it in the first place.
[2859.90 → 2860.88] We are doing it now.
[2860.94 → 2862.44] We talked about everything we did wrong.
[2862.76 → 2862.90] Yes.
[2862.90 → 2864.70] We talked about my feelings for a bit.
[2864.94 → 2865.12] Yeah.
[2865.12 → 2867.26] And then we said we're formalizing the warranty.
[2867.50 → 2867.72] Yes.
[2867.72 → 2868.18] It's coming.
[2868.56 → 2868.72] Yeah.
[2868.72 → 2870.74] It should have been here already, but it is officially coming.
[2870.86 → 2872.44] It will be in place before orders ship.
[2872.78 → 2874.74] As far as I know, it's like mostly done.
[2874.78 → 2875.70] It just needs lawyer approval.
[2877.30 → 2877.70] Okay.
[2878.76 → 2879.44] This is awesome.
[2879.84 → 2882.48] Bradley says, I never cared!
[2882.78 → 2884.62] Four exclamation marks.
[2885.02 → 2886.02] Wave one, baby!
[2887.36 → 2888.10] Thanks, Bradley.
[2888.10 → 2888.60] Wait.
[2888.60 → 2889.10] Wait.
[2889.10 → 2889.40] Wait.
[2889.40 → 2889.80] Oh my god.
[2889.80 → 2892.16] A shirt with a full written version of the warranty on it.
[2892.16 → 2894.20] That should be on the back of the Trust Me Bro warranty.
[2894.20 → 2895.20] Oh, I'm super down.
[2895.20 → 2895.86] I'm super down.
[2896.24 → 2896.64] Oh, man.
[2896.64 → 2898.08] That would look ugly, though.
[2898.20 → 2900.10] Maybe we do that as a second edition.
[2900.56 → 2900.88] Okay.
[2901.04 → 2901.20] Yeah.
[2901.36 → 2901.94] Or, oh.
[2902.00 → 2902.70] Where would you put it?
[2902.72 → 2903.32] Oh my goodness.
[2903.88 → 2907.44] I could, I could, oh, I don't know if our printer's going to want to do this.
[2907.54 → 2908.48] Our shirts are printed locally.
[2908.48 → 2909.04] Do it on the inside.
[2909.04 → 2910.18] Do it on the inside.
[2910.56 → 2912.58] If you put it in the right spot, so it's behind your face.
[2912.76 → 2914.64] You read it like a Star Wars text scroll.
[2914.92 → 2916.14] We'll do it bottom to top.
[2917.10 → 2919.72] So you can read it when you pull on your shirt.
[2920.02 → 2923.50] I don't think this is a worse idea than making the shirt in the first place.
[2923.50 → 2924.30] So, you know.
[2924.48 → 2924.92] Yeah.
[2925.18 → 2925.98] Oh, it's great.
[2926.22 → 2928.38] Apparently, apparently, yeah.
[2928.62 → 2929.32] Discount code.
[2929.44 → 2930.12] Deal of the week.
[2930.26 → 2935.42] Buy any t-shirt, excluding a mystery t-shirt, and get a sweatband set for 50% off.
[2935.48 → 2935.76] Heck yeah.
[2935.76 → 2936.96] Buy it automatically at checkout.
[2937.14 → 2937.54] Heck yeah.
[2937.54 → 2938.50] All right.
[2938.60 → 2939.18] Thanks, Luke.
[2939.50 → 2940.16] That's awesome.
[2940.66 → 2941.04] Gotcha.
[2941.50 → 2942.28] Oh, man.
[2943.52 → 2947.62] Do we want to take a break and talk about other topics?
[2947.86 → 2948.16] Sure.
[2948.28 → 2949.06] Yeah, let's do that.
[2949.26 → 2950.62] Is there, wait, merch messages?
[2950.70 → 2952.80] Is there more questions about the warranty thing?
[2952.94 → 2954.04] Well, we'll cover it at the end.
[2954.18 → 2954.48] Okay.
[2954.64 → 2955.88] I just, I want to be.
[2956.18 → 2957.46] Let's talk about something else.
[2957.46 → 2958.16] I want to be done.
[2959.14 → 2960.64] Let's talk about something else for a bit.
[2960.84 → 2961.22] All right.
[2961.34 → 2961.72] It's good.
[2962.04 → 2962.38] Okay.
[2962.42 → 2963.20] Should we talk about your pool?
[2964.78 → 2967.16] They finally, they finally shot the concrete.
[2967.16 → 2968.14] They actually did.
[2968.24 → 2969.40] They actually did.
[2969.48 → 2971.16] My belief level was low.
[2971.40 → 2971.66] Yeah.
[2971.92 → 2972.20] Yeah.
[2972.32 → 2973.56] It's the shortage.
[2973.90 → 2981.88] So apparently the issue comes down to the mix of, you'll have to forgive me, the manly
[2981.88 → 2987.34] men who work in construction and, and women and others and anyone who works in the construction
[2987.34 → 2990.10] industry, all of you, uh, you'll have to forgive me.
[2990.18 → 2996.42] I'm probably going to get this wrong, but I think it's the ratio of cement in the concrete.
[2997.20 → 2998.18] Does that make sense?
[2998.52 → 2998.66] Yeah.
[2998.66 → 2998.94] Sorry.
[2998.94 → 3002.98] I said, Oh my God, because LTT labs, Jake just had a very good point that we should
[3002.98 → 3005.84] have had like frat bro shirts for the trust me bro t-shirt.
[3005.96 → 3006.62] It's our shirts.
[3006.92 → 3007.30] So yeah.
[3007.30 → 3008.08] Oh, that makes sense.
[3008.16 → 3008.36] We don't.
[3008.44 → 3008.64] Okay.
[3008.80 → 3009.00] Yeah.
[3009.00 → 3009.24] Yeah.
[3009.24 → 3011.28] We don't have like tank chops.
[3011.40 → 3011.76] That makes sense.
[3011.86 → 3012.02] Yeah.
[3012.22 → 3013.20] It's a good point though.
[3013.30 → 3014.42] What would have been the collared one?
[3016.02 → 3017.06] Oh yeah.
[3017.18 → 3017.54] Okay.
[3017.76 → 3018.10] It's fine.
[3018.14 → 3019.18] We don't have those anyway.
[3019.32 → 3019.46] Yeah.
[3021.78 → 3022.10] Sorry.
[3022.18 → 3022.34] Okay.
[3022.38 → 3022.56] Yeah.
[3022.56 → 3023.70] So concrete is shot.
[3023.86 → 3024.26] That's cool.
[3024.76 → 3025.04] Yeah.
[3025.24 → 3028.58] So, um, but that doesn't mean that we're going to swim this summer, Luke.
[3028.94 → 3029.62] Oh, why?
[3029.68 → 3030.86] It needs a month to cure.
[3031.20 → 3032.02] A month.
[3032.10 → 3035.08] And at that stage, they can put on plaster.
[3035.92 → 3036.12] Yeah.
[3036.12 → 3038.90] And then after that, they can tile.
[3039.38 → 3044.08] And then after that, they can like, you know, do the, the like deck.
[3044.08 → 3046.02] Is there like ceiling on the tile as well?
[3046.02 → 3047.42] I would assume so.
[3047.48 → 3047.62] Yeah.
[3047.72 → 3048.06] Yeah.
[3048.08 → 3052.82] I mean, I'm not a pool construction expert, which is why I hired hopefully experts to
[3052.82 → 3053.24] do it.
[3053.68 → 3053.84] Yeah.
[3053.84 → 3054.96] We'll see how it goes.
[3055.04 → 3055.78] Well, that's unfortunate.
[3055.90 → 3056.48] I don't even know.
[3057.30 → 3060.42] Oh, apparently I got it right.
[3061.04 → 3062.70] Concrete is made of cement.
[3062.88 → 3063.20] Okay.
[3063.38 → 3063.68] Good.
[3063.76 → 3065.74] And the ratios matter depending on what you're making.
[3065.84 → 3066.24] Right, right, right.
[3066.38 → 3069.56] So that's apparently the problem is that there was a shortage.
[3069.74 → 3075.20] So there's been a bit of backlog to get through and the concrete, which is really cool.
[3075.20 → 3077.44] I, I, uh, I happened to be off that day.
[3077.66 → 3081.40] So I went out, I brought them a bowl of watermelon, and I was just kind of hanging back.
[3081.40 → 3083.96] Like watch, man, I painted houses, man.
[3084.28 → 3085.22] I know what's up.
[3085.36 → 3089.84] If you are out there working in the sun and the homeowner doesn't at least like bring you
[3089.84 → 3092.34] out a lemonade or something from the fridge, man.
[3092.34 → 3095.24] Don't take this the wrong way, but you suck.
[3096.32 → 3097.54] One of my favourite ones.
[3097.66 → 3103.56] It was probably bad in the end, but, uh, there's this picture going around where a like internet
[3103.56 → 3106.06] install technician is laying on the floor.
[3106.22 → 3106.50] Yeah.
[3106.68 → 3108.38] Doing what he got to do.
[3108.38 → 3111.34] Um, and he fell asleep and they just left him.
[3111.52 → 3112.40] They were like, Oh, he'll be fine.
[3112.50 → 3112.98] They just let him.
[3113.04 → 3114.54] He's like, I probably deserve a nap.
[3115.60 → 3119.98] It's like, that's kind of a bro move, but also like, yeah, probably not.
[3120.06 → 3121.54] I'd have appreciated being woken up.
[3121.66 → 3121.94] Yeah.
[3122.66 → 3125.56] Anyway, I was watching them shoot the they call it concrete.
[3125.84 → 3126.06] Yeah.
[3126.46 → 3128.62] And it's wild.
[3128.62 → 3131.72] So they had two cement mixers in the back alley.
[3132.12 → 3138.26] They had this like machine that, I mean, the pump must've just been incredible.
[3138.40 → 3144.62] Because it's this, it's this like thing they hold, and they just like blow it vertically
[3144.62 → 3145.44] at the side.
[3145.62 → 3149.12] Wait, I thought, yeah, I thought they would have, I thought they would have put down moulds
[3149.12 → 3150.20] and they would have cast it.
[3151.08 → 3152.74] No, that's nuts.
[3153.00 → 3153.14] No.
[3153.20 → 3157.94] So they, they shoot it, and it's kind of like, man, I don't even know what I would compare
[3157.94 → 3158.46] it to.
[3158.72 → 3161.90] Like, it was kind of like painting almost like, like, so there's like, they're like
[3161.90 → 3166.54] layering it or like when they applied the, uh, the cellulose insulation, like the spray
[3166.54 → 3167.06] foam, right.
[3167.08 → 3169.02] But most people won't have that as a frame of reference.
[3169.02 → 3169.88] That's why I didn't bring it up.
[3170.00 → 3170.10] Yeah.
[3170.10 → 3170.28] Yeah.
[3170.32 → 3171.08] I don't know.
[3171.12 → 3174.66] So I don't know what to compare it to that most people would have a frame of reference
[3174.66 → 3177.00] for, but, but they're, they're just like, they're blowing it up.
[3177.06 → 3178.86] They're like layering it on like this.
[3178.98 → 3186.10] And then they go back, and they actually like hand sculpt it like with tools, but like hand
[3186.10 → 3186.44] tools.
[3186.58 → 3186.72] Right.
[3186.72 → 3186.76] Right.
[3187.38 → 3189.38] And so I wouldn't have expected any part of this.
[3189.64 → 3195.24] So in one day it went from rebar with gravel and like insulation on the sides, like foam
[3195.24 → 3201.96] board insulation in one day it went from that to, uh, this like super rough thing.
[3201.96 → 3204.90] And they had like 10, 12 people there, like huge crew.
[3205.06 → 3209.62] I had, so they go, and then someone's coming behind, like going, like smoothing it out, checking,
[3209.74 → 3211.04] making sure everything's true.
[3211.04 → 3214.38] And like the stairs, it's one of those stupid things, right?
[3215.00 → 3220.88] Like, obviously if, if someone had a gun to my head and said, try to figure out how they
[3220.88 → 3226.60] make stairs in concrete pools, I'd have been like, uh, uh, I mean, I guess they probably
[3226.60 → 3228.26] formed them when the concrete's wet.
[3228.26 → 3231.08] Um, and then the tile over them after, Oh yeah.
[3231.08 → 3232.02] Am I, am I dead yet?
[3232.10 → 3232.36] Right.
[3232.78 → 3234.26] But I just never thought about it.
[3234.50 → 3234.70] Yeah.
[3234.76 → 3241.42] And so watching them just like, you know, like, like basically make sandcastle stairs out of,
[3241.42 → 3244.12] out of partially hardened concrete.
[3244.12 → 3247.02] Because they, like they have to work on it, uh, in stages.
[3247.18 → 3251.00] So they have to do the stuff that they can do while it's still really runny and then
[3251.00 → 3254.04] do the stuff that they need to do when it's a little less runny.
[3254.04 → 3258.16] And like, they're just like going around like, man, it is a really cool process.
[3258.80 → 3259.16] Actually.
[3259.54 → 3260.58] That's my foot by the way.
[3261.10 → 3262.00] Oh, that's okay.
[3262.00 → 3262.20] Here.
[3263.48 → 3263.88] More.
[3264.04 → 3264.68] More good.
[3266.16 → 3269.12] I didn't want to like interrupt you, but I was like, I think he doesn't know.
[3272.48 → 3273.14] That's funny.
[3273.32 → 3273.68] Oh.
[3274.12 → 3277.98] Um, the t-shirt discount code.
[3278.02 → 3278.40] We said it.
[3278.44 → 3278.92] We said it.
[3279.20 → 3280.12] At least twice.
[3280.80 → 3281.16] Yeah.
[3281.16 → 3281.86] You said it.
[3282.04 → 3283.52] Oh, the actual code itself.
[3283.62 → 3285.32] Oh, uh, sorry.
[3286.86 → 3288.66] No, it says automatically applied at discount.
[3289.06 → 3289.92] There is no code.
[3290.04 → 3290.20] Yeah.
[3290.20 → 3293.42] So a t-shirt and sweatband set, and you get a discount on this.
[3293.42 → 3298.00] Buy any t-shirt, excluding mystery shirt, get a sweatband for 50% off applied automatically
[3298.00 → 3298.40] at discount.
[3298.50 → 3298.58] Yeah.
[3298.58 → 3299.14] We got this.
[3299.78 → 3300.18] Yeah.
[3300.22 → 3300.54] All right.
[3300.64 → 3300.86] Cool.
[3302.28 → 3303.22] Oh man.
[3304.16 → 3308.34] I don't, I don't even know if I want to talk about this other thing now.
[3308.38 → 3310.78] I'm so like, I'm so drained.
[3311.08 → 3311.90] Netflix has games.
[3312.32 → 3312.68] Yeah.
[3312.82 → 3313.54] Let's talk about that.
[3313.54 → 3313.84] Hit me.
[3313.84 → 3317.28] Included with every Netflix subscription is Netflix games.
[3317.28 → 3318.36] A handful of games.
[3318.36 → 3319.84] It's a little bit more than a handful, to be honest.
[3320.08 → 3323.10] A handful of games are released as individual mobile apps on iOS.
[3323.56 → 3324.06] Oh, I see.
[3324.40 → 3327.90] A full catalogue of 24 titles is in the Netflix app.
[3328.12 → 3332.18] There are no ads, no fees, and no in-app purchases.
[3332.18 → 3336.56] These are meant to serve as a sort of bridge to cross while waiting for the next instalment
[3336.56 → 3337.40] of a running series.
[3337.52 → 3341.18] They don't want you to cancel your subscription between seasons of Stranger Things.
[3341.46 → 3341.74] Okay.
[3342.50 → 3345.00] Stranger Things has a couple of games based around it.
[3345.14 → 3347.32] The Queen's Gambit has an upcoming chess game.
[3350.06 → 3350.46] Okay.
[3350.58 → 3350.90] Okay.
[3350.90 → 3355.14] Well, I mean, you know, it's about, it's like a chess thing, right?
[3355.84 → 3355.98] Huh?
[3356.16 → 3357.06] The Queen's Gambit.
[3357.06 → 3358.22] No, I know, but is it just chess?
[3358.52 → 3360.46] Or like, is there more to it?
[3360.90 → 3361.30] Like, is it?
[3361.34 → 3363.66] Maybe there's a campaign and like they have voice actors.
[3364.26 → 3365.06] That'd be kind of cool.
[3365.06 → 3365.64] That'd actually be cool.
[3365.82 → 3367.26] I'd actually be totally down.
[3367.36 → 3368.52] Yeah, that's actually a perfect idea.
[3368.52 → 3369.92] Like, I think that's why I answered it.
[3369.92 → 3370.64] Maybe that's what they're doing.
[3370.76 → 3374.70] That way, it's like, if they do something more than just a generic chess game, it could be
[3374.70 → 3375.72] fascinating, but we'll see.
[3375.72 → 3381.14] Um, there's also some decent indie games that reported to mobile, like into the breach.
[3381.26 → 3381.86] I had no idea.
[3381.98 → 3384.78] That's from the developers of FTL, uh, Moonlighter.
[3384.84 → 3389.18] They apparently paid $72 million for finished developer next games.
[3389.30 → 3393.40] Netflix says the catalogue will grow to 50 titles before the end of the year.
[3393.54 → 3399.12] And then here's where things get a little interesting because I have potentially a non-normal
[3399.12 → 3403.64] take on this, but it says the only problem is less than 1% of their users are playing them.
[3403.64 → 3407.30] They average 1.7 million daily users.
[3407.42 → 3409.92] I mean, that's a lot of people, but yes, yes.
[3410.62 → 3415.66] I think this is saying for the games, but they have 221 million subscribers.
[3416.48 → 3416.92] Right.
[3417.18 → 3423.98] So that's, man, if you had, like, let's say you run a store, you run a supermarket and
[3423.98 → 3430.52] you realize that you have an entire department that only 1% of people even like walk into.
[3430.64 → 3430.90] Yeah.
[3431.12 → 3431.32] Yeah.
[3431.32 → 3432.06] That's pretty bad.
[3432.06 → 3433.28] See, I think so.
[3433.34 → 3436.66] But then it's also like this super weird tertiary thing.
[3437.00 → 3437.32] Yeah.
[3437.38 → 3441.78] It's like if the supermarket randomly offered go-karts and only 1% of the customers used
[3441.78 → 3442.90] go-karts, and they were pissed.
[3442.98 → 3446.76] It's funny you used go-karts as an example, because I was like, where's he going with this?
[3447.20 → 3449.58] What's he going to come up with that they don't have at a supermarket?
[3449.58 → 3449.74] Yeah.
[3449.74 → 3450.24] I don't know.
[3450.50 → 3451.50] I mean, they have got-
[3451.50 → 3451.52] Because it's kind of hard.
[3451.98 → 3454.98] Sears became known for having a photography studio in it.
[3455.36 → 3457.70] Like, how random is that?
[3457.70 → 3459.90] There's McDonald's in half the Walmart's.
[3460.98 → 3465.76] I mean, the megacorporation-caption is real at this point.
[3465.88 → 3466.62] Like, what could-
[3466.62 → 3467.70] And I wonder about that.
[3467.80 → 3469.12] It wouldn't surprise me.
[3469.30 → 3471.32] We got West Edmonton Mall, Luke.
[3471.56 → 3475.08] There's literally a water park in an f***ING mall in Canada.
[3475.08 → 3476.38] The West Edmonton Mall is actually awesome.
[3476.42 → 3477.32] On this timeline.
[3477.52 → 3478.78] The West Edmonton Mall is fantastic.
[3479.06 → 3482.66] I haven't been there in a super long time, but I was there for a provincial hockey tournament,
[3482.96 → 3485.86] and the mall was pretty sweet.
[3486.02 → 3486.20] Yeah.
[3487.56 → 3488.62] But yeah, I don't know.
[3488.82 → 3495.96] Like, yes, 1% of the users is low, but 1.7 million daily active users for a series of 24 games?
[3496.54 → 3497.88] Yeah, I guess that's not that many games.
[3498.02 → 3499.48] Is pretty good, I think.
[3499.50 → 3500.58] Yeah, that's actually-
[3500.58 → 3502.04] I mean, unless it's like bejewelled.
[3502.04 → 3508.54] Like, what, are you expecting every single person that watches Netflix to want to play the Stranger Things game?
[3508.54 → 3511.16] To want to play that particular subset of games.
[3511.16 → 3512.00] And play it like through their app.
[3512.00 → 3513.28] To sign in that day.
[3513.42 → 3513.66] Yeah.
[3513.82 → 3515.62] It's a lot of ducks to align, actually.
[3516.38 → 3518.70] And it's 1.7 million daily users.
[3518.82 → 3520.00] A lot of stars to align, sorry.
[3520.10 → 3521.68] See, okay, again though, I don't know.
[3521.78 → 3523.26] This is worded kind of oddly.
[3523.88 → 3528.46] They average 1.7 million daily users, 221 million subscribers, though.
[3528.46 → 3533.34] Is that saying that Netflix averages 1.7 million daily users, or that the games do?
[3533.96 → 3535.90] It doesn't like, it's worded.
[3535.90 → 3538.54] But I'm really not 100% certain what's going on there.
[3539.62 → 3541.80] But either way, like 1% of the-
[3541.80 → 3548.02] I actually don't think there's as much of a crossover as they would think between people that would want to play games on Netflix.
[3548.38 → 3548.64] Yeah.
[3549.40 → 3551.28] And people like-
[3551.28 → 3556.06] So maybe this is just one of those things where an executive was like, yeah, gaming.
[3556.52 → 3557.86] Like gaming, we got to get a piece of that.
[3557.92 → 3560.32] I mean, Netflix wouldn't be the first to try that strategy.
[3560.82 → 3562.94] Turns out gaming's like really tough.
[3562.94 → 3563.30] Yeah.
[3563.50 → 3564.94] Like I don't think-
[3564.94 → 3565.14] It's really, really tough.
[3568.86 → 3570.34] That would not be my go-to.
[3570.76 → 3576.58] Like as a gamer, if I had a Netflix subscription, which I don't, I don't think I would bother checking it out.
[3576.58 → 3583.46] I think this is more of like you were kind of positioning, like executive decision problem or not a problem.
[3583.72 → 3584.82] I think it's one of the two.
[3585.18 → 3585.68] Or maybe the-
[3585.68 → 3586.92] Yeah, maybe it's not a problem.
[3586.92 → 3589.86] And what they need to do is double down and have more than 24 games.
[3589.86 → 3596.22] That or maybe like the way that they present it to users should be more different, whatever.
[3596.64 → 3604.34] But I think it's going to be extremely hard to get people to subscribe to Netflix for their games.
[3604.82 → 3605.22] Right.
[3605.32 → 3609.24] And I think that's the only way that this solves the problem that they're trying to get it to solve.
[3609.64 → 3609.96] Right.
[3609.96 → 3612.58] Because you would have to-
[3612.58 → 3613.64] You'd have to be a destination.
[3614.00 → 3614.30] Yes.
[3614.34 → 3614.86] It's that simple.
[3614.92 → 3620.60] And you'd have to want to retain your subscription if there's no content that you wanted to watch for this to actually function.
[3621.46 → 3624.18] So like, is there enough games?
[3624.22 → 3624.80] That's another one.
[3624.90 → 3626.18] Like how big are these games?
[3626.72 → 3631.32] Like if I'm just going to beat this Stranger Things game in a week, it doesn't tide me between seasons.
[3631.32 → 3634.38] It's going to have to hold for like a year or two years?
[3634.56 → 3637.18] And like you look at how much Apple's invested in Apple Arcade.
[3637.52 → 3638.92] They have way more titles.
[3639.02 → 3648.76] And even with that, there's only one that as someone who's not already on the service scrolling this, there's only one that I've gone, oh, that's a killer app.
[3648.82 → 3648.98] Yeah.
[3649.22 → 3650.88] I should consider Apple Arcade.
[3651.54 → 3654.32] And that's that, I think it's called Fantasia.
[3654.32 → 3660.64] I still haven't played it because I don't have Apple Arcade and I don't want any cloud saves or anything stuck in iCloud.
[3660.86 → 3663.86] So I'll just wait for it to come to another platform where I can control my save data.
[3664.14 → 3675.52] But yeah, even though we talk about the tech industry a lot, I had no idea that Netflix was like, that this was a major push at least.
[3675.78 → 3675.94] Yeah.
[3676.36 → 3678.14] Like I remember hearing rumblings about it.
[3678.14 → 3678.76] I'd heard about it.
[3678.80 → 3679.02] Yeah.
[3679.16 → 3681.98] I didn't know it was like out and stuff like that.
[3682.14 → 3683.44] People keep on saying they have Into the Breach.
[3683.44 → 3683.88] Yeah.
[3684.28 → 3687.52] And Into the Breach is a short but very replayable game.
[3687.70 → 3690.04] I don't think it's going to keep someone interested for two years.
[3691.20 → 3691.36] Yeah.
[3692.52 → 3693.18] Oh my.
[3693.34 → 3693.54] Sorry.
[3695.38 → 3699.44] I think a lot of people don't like subscriptions for things.
[3700.28 → 3701.92] There's gaming subscriptions out there.
[3702.08 → 3707.88] Like how much is the let's go with a company that is not actually super positive in the news lately.
[3708.54 → 3709.88] Other than us.
[3710.42 → 3712.44] Ubisoft subscriptions.
[3713.18 → 3713.42] Wow.
[3713.44 → 3719.10] So, um, how many more times are you going to, are you going to take those pot shots?
[3719.12 → 3719.58] Not too many.
[3719.82 → 3720.38] Not too many.
[3720.46 → 3722.58] Because yeah, by all means, come at me, bro.
[3723.00 → 3723.72] Come at me, bro.
[3725.00 → 3725.82] Oh man.
[3726.16 → 3729.18] Ubisoft just asked me to verify my age to subscribe, to continue.
[3729.32 → 3729.98] And I was sad.
[3729.98 → 3730.68] Uh, okay.
[3730.68 → 3732.66] So Ubisoft plus is 20 bucks a month.
[3733.14 → 3737.82] Enjoy 100 plus games on PC or select titles across your devices from the cloud, et cetera.
[3739.26 → 3742.78] That's a lot of games from a huge studio.
[3742.90 → 3745.30] These are very expansive games, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3745.76 → 3747.98] It's 19 or 20 bucks a month.
[3747.98 → 3749.06] How much is Netflix?
[3749.58 → 3753.22] Netflix subscription cost?
[3755.32 → 3756.38] 20 bucks a month.
[3756.38 → 3759.80] So you're paying the same amount.
[3760.00 → 3761.10] I didn't prep this.
[3761.16 → 3761.78] I didn't know that.
[3761.94 → 3762.04] Right.
[3762.04 → 3762.80] You're paying the same amount.
[3762.92 → 3772.90] If you don't have anything to watch right now on Netflix, you have to make that subscription the same value of at least that, that, uh, you play plus thing.
[3772.90 → 3777.18] Someone's saying Microsoft game pass, which we actually know is a perfect value.
[3777.32 → 3780.16] We dog on Microsoft all the time, but game pass is like crazy.
[3780.78 → 3782.80] Um, it's 16 bucks a month.
[3783.34 → 3795.30] So like, really, man, like trying to make it so that it's worth it while having nothing to watch is going to be insanely hard and require probably like multiple studios.
[3795.66 → 3798.40] Like this is, this is a big deal thing.
[3798.96 → 3801.28] I don't think it's really going to tide people over.
[3801.28 → 3806.76] I don't think anyone's going to want to cancel the Netflix subscription and be like, ah, I want to play that game though.
[3807.88 → 3808.36] Maybe.
[3809.04 → 3816.88] I don't think it's going to be too common, but yeah, it's, it is technically a maybe.
[3817.26 → 3817.68] No way.
[3817.72 → 3818.68] Netflix is 20 bucks a month.
[3818.72 → 3819.48] I thought it was 12.
[3819.94 → 3824.56] Uh, let me re Google this Netflix subscription cost.
[3824.64 → 3826.10] It shows 20 bucks there.
[3827.88 → 3829.94] Um, well, that's for premium.
[3829.94 → 3832.62] Standard is 1649.
[3832.80 → 3835.98] I'm talking Canadian dollars to be clear for both of these though.
[3836.64 → 3837.82] Um, premium.
[3837.98 → 3838.96] What is different with premium?
[3839.38 → 3840.84] Ultra HD is available.
[3842.86 → 3846.36] HD is HD becomes available with standard.
[3846.36 → 3850.50] So I think you're looking at least 1649 a month.
[3850.88 → 3854.06] And if you have like a sweet TV, you're looking at $21 a month.
[3854.46 → 3854.78] Canadian.
[3858.22 → 3859.58] Say something about wave three.
[3860.14 → 3861.64] The backpacks are in wave three now.
[3861.80 → 3862.84] I don't know what else to say.
[3865.64 → 3866.04] Okay.
[3866.04 → 3867.94] Oh, wow.
[3868.02 → 3868.28] I forgot.
[3868.28 → 3868.64] I forgot.
[3868.78 → 3869.28] I have a mouse.
[3869.40 → 3871.06] I like pulled my mouse out before the show.
[3871.06 → 3871.50] That's so sweet.
[3871.68 → 3871.88] Yeah.
[3872.02 → 3874.16] I should just, I should just always use my mouse.
[3874.66 → 3875.14] All right.
[3875.14 → 3878.62] We should probably do a couple of merch messages because they're getting a little bit out of
[3878.62 → 3880.00] control in terms of volume.
[3880.40 → 3883.80] Um, Dan, do you want me to, yeah.
[3883.80 → 3888.74] Uh, uh, by the way, uh, trust the only thing that's selling better than backpack today is
[3888.74 → 3889.42] trust me, bro.
[3889.46 → 3890.16] Warranty shirt.
[3890.64 → 3891.82] Just so you know.
[3892.14 → 3892.48] Oh my goodness.
[3892.48 → 3893.32] I can barely keep up.
[3894.30 → 3898.82] I do want me to just read them, and you can keep curating because there's like half a dozen
[3898.82 → 3899.24] incoming.
[3899.60 → 3899.76] Yeah.
[3899.78 → 3902.42] Why don't you pick a couple and just go for it, and I'll get one after that.
[3902.60 → 3904.50] Uh, Josh asks, how's your riding season going?
[3904.60 → 3906.08] How about a video on the bike and your gear?
[3906.84 → 3909.54] Uh, I've barely touched it.
[3909.96 → 3913.60] I just wasn't able to for one reason or another for a while.
[3913.60 → 3916.74] Like there's just no reason to ever be by myself going somewhere.
[3916.74 → 3924.62] And then finally I had this string of opportunities to ride the bike, and it was Tetris inside shelves
[3924.62 → 3930.14] and construction materials and crap in my lower garage, uh, while they were painting the walls.
[3930.26 → 3934.38] So it was just this Island of debris with my motorbike at the centre of it.
[3934.54 → 3940.52] And I was like, even if I had the strength and time to move all of this, I wouldn't be able
[3940.52 → 3943.38] to because the painters need access to the walls.
[3943.60 → 3946.38] So I would have to not only move on, I have to put it all back.
[3946.62 → 3948.24] And that's all, that's a lot for one ride.
[3948.34 → 3950.32] My riding season is going terrible.
[3950.50 → 3951.84] Thank you for asking Josh.
[3951.94 → 3953.02] Thank you for the order though.
[3953.38 → 3957.04] Uh, anonymous asks, oh my goodness, this is moving so fast.
[3957.74 → 3961.92] Uh, for Luke is float plane background play being worked on?
[3962.12 → 3965.22] Yes, actually that is the current task of our mobile developer.
[3965.88 → 3966.28] Nice.
[3966.28 → 3967.14] What's up, Jayden?
[3967.30 → 3973.42] And he, he got it like to a working state superfast, but now he's trying to make it
[3973.42 → 3976.26] more like usable and stuff before we launch it.
[3976.32 → 3978.90] So it's, it's coming and probably sooner than you think.
[3978.98 → 3979.24] Cool.
[3979.48 → 3980.12] Luke asks,
[3980.12 → 3983.08] Hey Linus, another Luke.
[3983.46 → 3986.10] You re-inspired my interest in tech five years ago.
[3986.24 → 3989.00] Today I'm helping implement an e-sports team at a university.
[3989.88 → 3990.64] Oh, that's cool.
[3990.80 → 3990.90] Cool.
[3990.90 → 3994.78] Have you considered sponsoring an e-sports team or player under the LTT umbrella?
[3995.16 → 3996.14] That's a good question.
[3996.54 → 3998.60] Um, you know, it's, it's a funny thing.
[3998.60 → 4006.56] Like the way I, it kind of feels like, I don't know what would I, I think if you got someone
[4006.56 → 4016.80] on staff who like, even then, like, okay, we are an influencer like company sort of, you
[4016.80 → 4018.96] know, like we sell, we sell, we sell, yeah.
[4019.06 → 4021.02] Influencer marketing essentially.
[4021.20 → 4021.42] Right.
[4021.42 → 4030.84] So then do we take our influencer marketing and spend it on influencer marketing to be
[4030.84 → 4031.24] clear?
[4031.96 → 4035.12] It's happened, and you're going to see more of it.
[4035.34 → 4036.28] It will happen again.
[4036.44 → 4038.12] Particularly around LTT store.
[4039.34 → 4044.86] But in terms of like the gaming scene, I, I can't say I've given it a ton of thought.
[4046.26 → 4048.42] I don't really see it.
[4048.42 → 4053.66] Cause like, in my opinion, uh, okay.
[4055.18 → 4063.50] I prefer when, when sponsors don't just sort of like half butt, uh, sponsorships for, for
[4063.50 → 4064.10] e-sports team.
[4064.22 → 4069.62] I like it when they, they push it harder and like really try to help enable the players
[4069.62 → 4073.86] and like, it becomes a part, like it really becomes a thing that like help with management
[4073.86 → 4075.78] and stuff like that to try to like to push them forward.
[4075.78 → 4080.90] Um, and I'm not a huge fan of just companies that just like, ah, we'll throw money at this
[4080.90 → 4087.16] e-sports team, which is usually much cheaper, like wildly cheaper than a sports team or something
[4087.16 → 4087.62] like that.
[4087.68 → 4091.02] Even if you're getting the same views and stuff, we'll throw money at this team to throw a
[4091.02 → 4093.66] logo on their shirt and call themselves our name or whatever.
[4094.26 → 4100.22] Um, so just like, and we don't have the bandwidth to like to do all of that stuff, and it wouldn't make
[4100.22 → 4101.28] a ton of sense for us anyway.
[4101.28 → 4105.66] So I would prefer that the e-sports organizations that are going to do it really well would
[4105.66 → 4108.04] do it instead of, instead of us.
[4108.24 → 4108.94] It's not our focus.
[4109.24 → 4112.10] With that said, I sponsored a local badminton club.
[4112.54 → 4113.40] I sponsored their team.
[4113.56 → 4114.02] Oh, that's sweet.
[4114.14 → 4116.56] But honestly, that was not about the marketing.
[4116.84 → 4118.04] So again, it comes back to like.
[4118.04 → 4118.64] Yeah, that's a different situation.
[4118.72 → 4118.92] Yeah.
[4119.00 → 4121.30] Why am I, why am I buying marketing?
[4121.44 → 4122.68] I literally am marketing.
[4122.98 → 4125.88] So why am I paying someone else to do my job for me?
[4126.38 → 4126.56] Yeah.
[4126.56 → 4128.78] And if I am doing that, why aren't I just hiring them?
[4128.98 → 4132.26] Sponsoring a local sports team that like needs it.
[4132.50 → 4132.70] Yeah.
[4132.72 → 4133.78] They get no funding.
[4133.96 → 4134.14] Yeah.
[4134.30 → 4134.86] Yeah, exactly.
[4135.02 → 4136.76] This is, this is a different situation.
[4136.92 → 4139.12] And I'm not just sponsoring the team.
[4139.30 → 4145.36] So the, the sponsorship, um, covers like, like logo placements and stuff.
[4145.40 → 4149.16] Honestly, I, I told the I told the head coach, I was like, dude, I don't care.
[4149.52 → 4151.00] You can put the logo on the shirt.
[4151.08 → 4152.40] You could not put the logo on the shirt.
[4152.40 → 4156.86] Quite frankly, like no offence, but the literal dozens of people that are going to see the
[4156.86 → 4157.44] logo there.
[4157.66 → 4159.42] And like, what are you going to do?
[4159.46 → 4162.82] A reverse, a reverse Google image search to find out what it is.
[4162.84 → 4165.68] Because I don't even have the name on it.
[4165.92 → 4166.24] Like it's.
[4166.60 → 4167.96] Oh, it's just the logo.
[4167.98 → 4169.14] It's just the circle logo.
[4169.32 → 4171.96] It's like, dude, this is not moving the needle for me at all.
[4171.96 → 4176.08] Something that the snowboarding community has done is, uh, they just replaced that stuff
[4176.08 → 4181.42] with drink water because it's, it's like a it's a counter to all the energy drink.
[4181.48 → 4181.68] Yeah.
[4181.68 → 4182.22] I like it.
[4182.42 → 4182.66] Okay.
[4182.80 → 4183.96] And the energy drinks are bad for you.
[4184.02 → 4187.16] So they, the people have started putting stickers and stuff on their boards that just say drink
[4187.16 → 4187.42] water.
[4187.60 → 4190.60] If they do a great job, and we do another round, then maybe I'll do something like that.
[4190.60 → 4194.30] Because he was like very insistent that they like wanted to display the logo.
[4194.36 → 4198.28] I'm like, okay, dude, you do you, uh, water badminton actually sounds awesome.
[4198.28 → 4198.48] Yeah.
[4198.48 → 4200.06] But I really, but I really don't care.
[4200.06 → 4206.46] Um, for me, uh, what I was interested in was he laid out a plan to set aside a significant
[4206.46 → 4212.42] portion of the funding for grassroots badminton, um, camps in schools in the lower mainland.
[4212.42 → 4212.82] Oh, that's cool.
[4212.82 → 4218.00] Uh, because one of the big challenges for them is getting enough momentum while they
[4218.00 → 4223.36] build up attendance at these things to afford, even, uh, like renting a school gym, you still
[4223.36 → 4223.88] have to pay.
[4223.88 → 4229.16] So to be able to afford the startup costs of the coaches and the gyms, um, it would
[4229.16 → 4230.68] have just been too much out of pocket.
[4230.68 → 4233.62] And so I said, yeah, I'd actually love to fund that.
[4233.68 → 4234.36] I love the sport.
[4234.56 → 4236.64] I think it's a really complete sport.
[4236.96 → 4238.38] Um, you have to be fast.
[4238.42 → 4239.40] You have to be strong.
[4239.48 → 4245.24] You have to, you have to think, um, it is a far more, especially singles is a far more
[4245.24 → 4247.50] cerebral sport than I think people give it credit for.
[4247.60 → 4249.42] I have a lot of sports are like that.
[4249.60 → 4253.58] Like you see something like football and if you don't know how it works, you go, Oh, big
[4253.58 → 4253.90] guys.
[4254.16 → 4255.14] You think they're all right.
[4255.36 → 4258.24] There's also this like common thought that a lot of football players are dumb.
[4258.42 → 4261.70] And it's like, I mean, there are probably some that are, I'm sure.
[4261.92 → 4262.08] Yeah.
[4262.08 → 4264.28] But, but you'd also be surprised.
[4264.40 → 4268.48] There's some that are extremely not, um, I like the idea of the school funding.
[4268.54 → 4272.94] A lot of schools very, uh, a lot of schools struggle with funding in general, I will say.
[4273.00 → 4273.14] Yeah.
[4273.14 → 4274.22] So they rent out the gym.
[4274.34 → 4275.72] The schools get a bit more funding.
[4276.00 → 4279.24] Uh, I get to, I get to share my passion for a sport that I love.
[4279.28 → 4283.56] Uh, it was kind of a no-brainer for me, but this is something where again, like,
[4283.58 → 4285.64] I'm super involved in that community.
[4285.98 → 4287.92] So like Luke was saying with the e-sports' thing.
[4287.98 → 4288.12] Yeah.
[4288.12 → 4291.58] I don't, I don't feel like I have anything to contribute there.
[4291.66 → 4294.58] I feel like there's other people that are doing it better than I would already.
[4294.74 → 4295.94] And, and yeah.
[4296.00 → 4298.56] So I think just, just let them do that basically.
[4298.96 → 4299.14] Yeah.
[4300.62 → 4301.30] Oh my goodness.
[4301.38 → 4302.20] There's so many merge messages.
[4302.30 → 4304.88] I don't know if we're going to get through them all today, but we will do our darnedest.
[4305.12 → 4306.38] We will do our darnedest.
[4307.00 → 4307.60] Um, okay.
[4307.62 → 4308.50] No, we will do it.
[4308.70 → 4309.18] We'll do it.
[4309.26 → 4309.46] Sorry.
[4309.58 → 4309.98] Sorry guys.
[4310.06 → 4310.42] Sorry, Dan.
[4310.48 → 4310.82] Sorry, Luke.
[4310.96 → 4311.40] We'll do one.
[4311.40 → 4311.86] I can pull them.
[4312.02 → 4312.56] I can pull them.
[4312.64 → 4315.28] Just if you want to uncrate one, go for it.
[4315.66 → 4317.78] Um, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4317.84 → 4318.50] Well, we got this.
[4318.86 → 4321.24] Uh, Brendan says long time viewer, first time caller.
[4321.54 → 4324.92] Would love to see you all talk about less commonly known tech careers.
[4325.26 → 4327.18] DevOps is not less commonly known.
[4327.54 → 4328.30] Come on.
[4328.42 → 4329.02] Well, what are they?
[4329.04 → 4329.90] Come on.
[4330.30 → 4332.54] Uh, we have a DevOps on staff.
[4332.54 → 4333.06] No, no, no, no.
[4333.06 → 4334.84] I just mean, no, I don't mean what are DevOps.
[4334.84 → 4338.82] I mean, what are the less commonly known tech careers?
[4339.18 → 4342.86] I mean, there's a bunch, but like, I don't, I would love to be talking about it.
[4342.86 → 4346.30] Like the thing you trained for is something that I don't feel like gets talked about a lot.
[4346.60 → 4347.34] The like communication bridge?
[4347.34 → 4347.50] Yeah.
[4347.52 → 4349.72] The liaison like role.
[4349.72 → 4353.98] I don't think it's as needed these days to be fair.
[4354.30 → 4357.54] Um, but something that I was, I was effectively training for in school.
[4357.54 → 4371.46] My program did a lot of education around this was being a communication bridge for your team, uh, between like the technical people on your team, the people that you generally work with and the like business people on the team.
[4371.46 → 4379.10] And the idea was a bit more of an old business approach to things, but it is still definitely applicable to certain modern companies.
[4379.58 → 4391.28] Um, but it's, it's, it's where the, the business people, a lot of people making decisions in the company, a lot of the C levels just have no clue whatsoever, any technical terms, anything that has to do with anything that you're working on, all that type of stuff.
[4391.28 → 4402.60] And you have to try to translate the challenges that your team has, uh, to those people so they can understand why certain budgets need to go certain places, and they can try to make as informed decisions as possible.
[4402.88 → 4412.58] And it's a super important job because when you've got the people who understand and the people with the money, and they literally don't speak the same language.
[4412.78 → 4413.38] It's a problem.
[4413.48 → 4418.88] And it's not, I'm not even just trying to like point at the business and C level people in that situation and be like bad.
[4418.98 → 4419.84] Because I mean.
[4419.84 → 4421.62] And they probably know other stuff.
[4421.78 → 4422.10] Exactly.
[4422.76 → 4423.02] Right.
[4423.06 → 4425.64] And like, there might be situations where they are just like.
[4425.90 → 4426.12] Yeah.
[4426.18 → 4430.94] There are, there are very ignorant, terrible executives who literally like don't do anything.
[4430.94 → 4435.62] But there's also some people that are just super not technical, but they might be perfect, like CFOs or something.
[4435.82 → 4436.66] Perfect negotiators.
[4436.82 → 4437.10] Sure.
[4437.20 → 4438.32] They could have some other value.
[4438.44 → 4444.44] And they, they need to understand, but they're not going to go read like tech, technical documentation to figure out why your stuff matters.
[4444.64 → 4446.48] You should be able to communicate that to them.
[4447.06 → 4449.12] Um, so yeah, I don't know.
[4449.16 → 4449.48] That's a thing.
[4449.48 → 4454.82] Anyway, you all accelerated my career slash interest into tech and would love to see your angle on it.
[4455.04 → 4455.54] I don't know.
[4455.60 → 4459.66] All, all, literally all the things that you mentioned, we like to have on staff.
[4459.72 → 4459.92] Yeah.
[4460.14 → 4462.72] DevOps data and, and all we don't really have.
[4462.76 → 4464.80] And our dev team is like less than 10 people.
[4465.54 → 4467.54] It's less than, oh, our dev team.
[4467.58 → 4468.22] I thought you were saying it.
[4468.36 → 4471.26] This is all like what I would kind of put under like infrastructure stuff.
[4471.52 → 4471.84] Sure.
[4471.84 → 4473.78] Our infrastructure team is less than three people.
[4473.78 → 4477.34] Um, but yeah, DevOps, CCD, it's all very good stuff.
[4477.42 → 4479.20] It's also, you're saying less commonly known.
[4479.20 → 4480.56] It's very common these days.
[4480.82 → 4483.08] Um, but yeah.
[4484.46 → 4485.04] All right.
[4485.04 → 4485.52] It's good stuff.
[4485.60 → 4485.96] Thanks, Luke.
[4485.96 → 4486.76] Get into it if you're interested.
[4487.60 → 4489.10] Uh, Astro Parrot King.
[4489.60 → 4492.72] Do you both think the Steam store is full of spam?
[4493.72 → 4494.90] Do you think it's harmful?
[4495.06 → 4498.52] Asking because there are a lot of spam games on the PlayStation store.
[4498.88 → 4502.18] I mean, there's a lot of garbage in the Steam store.
[4502.38 → 4508.50] Luke and I have gone out of our way to just buy the cheapest games on Steam that are really poorly reviewed and just play them.
[4508.96 → 4510.04] Honestly, it's a lark.
[4510.14 → 4512.12] It's some of the most fun I've had gaming in years.
[4512.42 → 4512.76] It's super fun.
[4512.88 → 4513.02] Yeah.
[4513.16 → 4519.74] I think hands down the best one was, this wasn't on Steam, but in that like way of us playing games was Where's Waldo?
[4519.84 → 4520.58] Like easily.
[4521.22 → 4523.14] Best, best one by far.
[4523.60 → 4524.26] Hilariously bad.
[4524.34 → 4525.70] Where's Waldo for Super Nintendo?
[4526.66 → 4527.06] Insane.
[4527.54 → 4528.64] Play it with a goofy friend.
[4529.22 → 4530.42] Uh, it's worth it.
[4530.46 → 4531.20] You'll have some fun.
[4531.20 → 4535.04] However bad you think it is, it's so much worse.
[4535.28 → 4535.60] It's actually worse.
[4535.60 → 4540.36] I, we, uh, one that we'll, we'll joke about all the time is Barrow.
[4540.46 → 4542.06] Is it, it's Barrow 2020, right?
[4542.20 → 4542.92] Barrow 2020.
[4543.20 → 4544.54] Barrow 2020 is awesome.
[4544.54 → 4545.26] Classic game.
[4545.36 → 4545.56] Yeah.
[4545.66 → 4546.32] Classic game.
[4546.58 → 4548.42] Um, but yeah, I don't think so.
[4548.54 → 4549.24] To be completely honest.
[4549.24 → 4550.50] I don't think it's ruining the Steam store.
[4550.66 → 4551.82] I don't think it's full of spam.
[4552.10 → 4555.56] Uh, I think the Steam store is very, I haven't looked at the PlayStation store in forever,
[4555.56 → 4560.48] but I think the Steam store is very effective at what it tries to do in regard to pushing top sales,
[4560.48 → 4561.72] top trending items.
[4561.72 → 4568.04] Um, their curated list for you, I think is like never full of what I would call spam.
[4568.42 → 4572.04] Um, in order to find the spam on Steam, you have to look for it.
[4572.10 → 4574.28] You have to launch the Steam client.
[4576.12 → 4582.16] Where you will find 11 slides of crap, but then you can just close that and it goes away.
[4582.40 → 4582.62] Yeah.
[4582.62 → 4586.02] That's the one kind of really aggressive advertising behaviour.
[4586.14 → 4587.38] Oh, the pop-up at the start.
[4587.58 → 4589.68] I, I didn't even know what you're talking about.
[4589.70 → 4592.64] Because I just instinctively immediately close that every time.
[4592.74 → 4593.12] Yeah.
[4593.12 → 4593.64] That's annoying.
[4593.64 → 4599.26] The only reason it bothers me is that I often open up Steam after having not used it for a while
[4599.26 → 4601.66] on my VR PC where I do not have a mouse.
[4601.98 → 4607.76] So I have to use my stupid gyroscopic air mouse to get rid of the stupid thing.
[4607.76 → 4612.38] And so that's the only reason it even registers that it exists for me as well.
[4613.22 → 4613.62] Yeah.
[4613.66 → 4615.14] That like actually took me a second.
[4615.50 → 4616.80] Um, but yeah, I don't know.
[4616.88 → 4618.66] RTX 710 makes a good point.
[4618.86 → 4620.66] Porn games feel like 50% of Steam.
[4620.78 → 4621.62] You can turn that off.
[4621.86 → 4622.38] You can turn that off.
[4622.48 → 4628.88] And I've noticed that you've got to scroll pretty far in most genres to get into the just
[4628.88 → 4631.70] obviously pornographic stuff.
[4631.88 → 4632.78] You can also turn it off.
[4632.78 → 4634.72] I doubt it's perfect.
[4635.36 → 4639.56] I don't think I have anything filtered on mine, but, but I haven't come across almost
[4639.56 → 4641.02] anything by accident.
[4641.64 → 4641.76] Yeah.
[4643.84 → 4646.30] Oh, Conrad says you can disable that pop-up.
[4646.66 → 4647.70] Oh, maybe that's what I did.
[4647.90 → 4650.54] Because I, I don't, I haven't even thought about it in like forever.
[4651.62 → 4651.98] Okay.
[4652.04 → 4653.72] Well maybe I should deal with that.
[4653.84 → 4654.06] Yeah.
[4654.56 → 4655.24] I don't know.
[4655.24 → 4662.48] I am honestly, I am the king of just not bothering to change settings when it's so much faster
[4662.48 → 4664.86] for me to just quickly click off of it and get on with my life.
[4665.46 → 4672.58] On my desktop for years, I've had that stupid share X has an update, blah, blah, blah thing
[4672.58 → 4674.16] that comes up every time I boot my computer.
[4674.16 → 4677.26] And I'm always like, I should really disable this for years.
[4677.30 → 4680.70] Every time I've turned on my computer, I've thought I should really disable this pop-up.
[4680.76 → 4681.20] I don't care.
[4681.22 → 4682.08] Maybe you go to do something else.
[4682.08 → 4684.26] And then I just click off of it and I, I, I'm working.
[4684.50 → 4685.14] Immediate memory.
[4685.14 → 4686.10] I'm using my computer.
[4686.40 → 4686.64] Yeah.
[4687.10 → 4688.28] I'm, I'm the worst.
[4688.52 → 4689.16] I'm the worst.
[4689.40 → 4691.96] I can be that way with work computers too, for that exact same reason.
[4691.96 → 4696.06] If I'm turning the computer on, it's usually because I need to get to doing something real
[4696.06 → 4696.92] quick, you know?
[4697.30 → 4700.68] So like, yeah, but my personal computer is all nicely tailored.
[4700.78 → 4702.58] My startups are all nicely done.
[4702.70 → 4706.70] And yeah, I know that pop-up exists, but I haven't seen it in forever.
[4707.20 → 4711.76] Um, I don't know if that's because I'm dismissively closing it really quickly or if I change the
[4711.76 → 4712.52] setting, I don't know.
[4713.10 → 4718.90] You can stop seeing porn games by, by adding nuts, uh, NSFW to the tags that you filter out
[4718.90 → 4720.58] is another thing that Conrad said.
[4720.58 → 4722.48] Um, maybe that's what I did.
[4723.24 → 4724.18] I don't know.
[4724.42 → 4728.64] Because I, I don't really see those things ever, which is why I thought the you can, that you
[4728.64 → 4733.58] can filter them out, solved it, but maybe it's a little attack from both sides or maybe
[4733.58 → 4735.38] the filter is actually just like pretty good.
[4735.48 → 4735.96] I don't know.
[4737.44 → 4739.04] I've got another one here from Weston.
[4739.54 → 4744.50] Out of the entire house renovation, what has been your favourite non-tech related upgrade
[4744.50 → 4745.94] you have done, or you're going to do?
[4749.16 → 4756.10] Um, I tuned out because I was making some notes on something.
[4756.40 → 4759.16] So I'm going to find that one, and I'm going to read it unless you've pushed it down already.
[4759.16 → 4763.40] This, this is tech related, but something that you did with the, with the cameras in your
[4763.40 → 4764.90] new place inspired me.
[4764.98 → 4766.58] I know someone, I'm not going to name them.
[4766.76 → 4768.26] I'm telling you that just so that you know.
[4768.32 → 4768.50] Sure.
[4768.66 → 4774.22] Um, I know someone who, uh, is going to be having a baby relatively soon, and I had a
[4774.22 → 4774.82] thought process.
[4775.04 → 4775.36] I'm kidding.
[4775.42 → 4775.74] I'm kidding.
[4775.86 → 4776.18] Stop.
[4776.64 → 4777.04] Jeez.
[4778.00 → 4778.80] Get him going.
[4779.06 → 4780.14] Look in his eyes.
[4781.34 → 4781.74] Please.
[4781.74 → 4788.16] Um, I was thinking of doing something similar, but not actually so much for security.
[4788.16 → 4788.36] You're going to have a baby?
[4788.64 → 4788.98] No.
[4790.82 → 4793.72] I just, you know, it's so much fun to bother.
[4793.90 → 4794.98] Like how can I help it?
[4795.06 → 4795.26] You know?
[4795.64 → 4797.78] I was thinking of doing something similar for them.
[4797.86 → 4798.10] Yeah.
[4798.32 → 4800.88] So that they like baby's first steps moment.
[4801.04 → 4802.08] Maybe you don't have the camera out.
[4802.48 → 4802.86] Yeah.
[4803.20 → 4803.90] You've got this thing.
[4803.98 → 4807.64] Oh, just having like, uh, not as much for security, but a little bit more for like life
[4807.64 → 4808.06] recording.
[4808.70 → 4809.10] Interesting.
[4809.10 → 4811.76] So it's basically you've reinvented IBO.
[4815.32 → 4815.68] Yeah.
[4816.18 → 4820.94] But it's like, I like the closed circuit nature of it and like those types of things.
[4820.98 → 4823.94] So it's, it's like life recording, but it doesn't go on to anyone else's servers.
[4824.12 → 4825.06] You have it yourself.
[4825.72 → 4826.18] Ada, Ada.
[4826.26 → 4827.06] I like those things.
[4827.32 → 4827.60] Luke Jr.
[4827.72 → 4829.56] No, it is not me.
[4830.14 → 4830.68] Trust me.
[4831.34 → 4831.56] Yeah.
[4831.58 → 4833.66] I wouldn't have joked about it if it was actually him.
[4834.00 → 4837.90] I'm fairly sure that if Luke was having a baby, I would know about it.
[4839.10 → 4841.92] Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[4841.92 → 4843.76] Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[4845.88 → 4846.86] Next merch message.
[4848.28 → 4849.14] Uh, hold on.
[4849.18 → 4851.10] Should we do an actual topic for a sec here?
[4851.22 → 4853.14] Or like, I don't even, what is this show even?
[4853.18 → 4853.98] I have no idea.
[4854.32 → 4854.92] I don't know.
[4855.20 → 4855.60] Sponsors?
[4855.68 → 4856.06] I don't know.
[4856.16 → 4857.10] Oh, sponsors.
[4857.22 → 4857.88] Good Lord.
[4857.98 → 4858.58] Do you want to do those?
[4858.64 → 4859.46] We should do that.
[4859.52 → 4859.76] Yeah.
[4859.90 → 4862.26] Because we'll never get out of here if we don't do the sponsors.
[4862.52 → 4862.70] True.
[4862.70 → 4865.38] The show is brought to you by Wealth front.

[4878.66 → 4880.12] I think the chat's finally getting the video.

[4942.84 → 4947.94] Vulture provides high-performance cloud servers, bare metal storage, and managed Kubernetes at a
[4947.94 → 4949.34] fraction of the cost of big tech.

[4953.42 → 4954.80] and there's the ability to bring your own ISO.

[4968.30 → 4969.70] That was earlier in the sentence.
[4970.78 → 4975.32] With Vulture Talon Cloud GPU, you can deploy fractions of NVIDIA A100s because let's face
[4975.32 → 4977.04] it, it's hard to afford the whole thing.
[4977.60 → 4979.62] So you can handle even the most advanced workloads.

[4997.62 → 5001.82] Wish I could get that $150 code for non-new signups because we use them.
[5002.06 → 5006.64] Finally, the show is brought to you by Sea sonic, who in place of their regular talking points
[5006.64 → 5011.74] has asked me to say, up to 12-year warranty, over and over and over again.
[5012.34 → 5014.40] Sea sonic, up to 12-year warranty.
[5014.86 → 5017.30] Sea sonic, up to 12-year warranty.
[5017.30 → 5019.18] Hey, how long is that warranty for Sea sonic?
[5019.26 → 5026.18] Their warranty is up to 12 years on their Prime TX 1000-watt power supply, actually the
[5026.18 → 5027.40] rest of the Prime TX series.
[5027.86 → 5032.24] And that warranty length, in case you missed it before, is 12 years.
[5032.34 → 5032.84] That's right.
[5033.24 → 5039.02] Sea sonic warrants their power supplies for a whopping one dozen years, which is the same
[5039.02 → 5041.16] as two half-dozens or 12.
[5041.16 → 5049.08] It has other features too, but out of respect for Sea sonic's wishes, I will only be telling
[5049.08 → 5050.86] you about the 12-year warranty.
[5051.22 → 5052.44] The best thing about Sea sonic...
[5052.44 → 5053.42] Okay, I'm going off script now.
[5053.46 → 5056.38] The best thing about Sea sonic, though, is everyone I've met there is just good people.
[5056.68 → 5059.76] And that is very important too.
[5059.86 → 5062.92] So yes, they have a written warranty that's long.
[5063.04 → 5064.18] Is it industry-leading?
[5064.18 → 5064.78] I think so.
[5064.96 → 5068.36] I don't think there's anyone who does a longer guarantee period than Sea sonic in the power
[5068.36 → 5069.02] supply industry.
[5069.60 → 5070.76] And why shouldn't they?
[5070.92 → 5073.74] They've been doing it since as long as I've been alive, actually.
[5073.84 → 5075.04] I think we were born in the same year.
[5075.04 → 5078.12] I googled longest PSU warranty in the first thing that came up.
[5078.40 → 5083.88] It literally, word for word, Sea sonic offers industry-best 12-year warranty on its Prime Plus,
[5083.98 → 5084.46] Tom's Hardware.
[5084.86 → 5085.70] There you go.
[5086.14 → 5087.90] There you freaking go, ladies and gentlemen.
[5087.90 → 5092.80] You can learn more at seasonic.com or at the links down below.
[5093.58 → 5094.22] Love it.
[5096.32 → 5098.36] Had a fantastic question in Flow play chat.
[5098.70 → 5102.18] But does Sea sonic guarantee that you can trust me, bro, if you need support?
[5102.94 → 5103.30] 100%.
[5103.30 → 5104.56] I'd trust them, bro.
[5105.56 → 5106.58] I'd trust Sea sonic, bro.
[5106.58 → 5107.40] I'd trust Sea sonic.
[5107.72 → 5109.76] It's one of the reasons we love working with them so much.
[5109.84 → 5110.92] They're just like, they're chill.
[5111.20 → 5113.10] They're just like, yeah, we make good power supplies.
[5113.22 → 5113.38] What?
[5115.26 → 5115.66] What?
[5116.22 → 5116.58] What?
[5116.58 → 5116.66] What?
[5117.90 → 5118.94] What are you going to do about it?
[5118.94 → 5120.70] Have they ever, have they made anything else?
[5120.78 → 5121.66] Do they make anything else?
[5122.06 → 5124.12] They did that case, which was also cool.
[5124.44 → 5124.72] Okay.
[5124.96 → 5125.26] Yeah.
[5125.48 → 5131.36] I was going to say, like, so many old schools, like, just power supply brands have split
[5131.36 → 5132.50] out into a bunch of other things.
[5132.60 → 5133.30] Oh, yeah, for sure.
[5133.42 → 5136.02] Well, it's mostly brands that didn't make power supplies.
[5136.04 → 5136.88] It's mostly brands that marketed.
[5137.70 → 5138.16] Oh, no.
[5138.32 → 5142.52] Enema and Aztec used to be the big names in power supplies, and they totally broadened their
[5142.52 → 5143.22] portfolios.
[5144.34 → 5147.88] I kind of think who else was like the old school big power supply maker.
[5148.16 → 5150.86] PC power and cooling wasn't big, but they were reputable.
[5151.42 → 5151.52] Yep.
[5151.90 → 5153.46] But they got acquired by OCC.
[5153.60 → 5155.70] I don't think they actually ended up branching out.
[5155.92 → 5159.80] Speaking of companies whose warranties didn't end up panning out pretty well, they offered
[5159.80 → 5161.02] a lifetime warranty on their memory.
[5161.12 → 5163.24] I dare you to RMA some OCC memory today.
[5163.24 → 5170.08] Then the way the founder skipped town was pretty legendary.
[5170.58 → 5172.54] Apparently, he ended up somewhere in, like, South America.
[5172.92 → 5173.02] Yeah.
[5173.58 → 5173.76] Yeah.
[5173.76 → 5174.74] That's the rumour I heard.
[5174.80 → 5178.72] I have no idea if it's actually true, but I know for a fact he ain't in America anymore,
[5178.72 → 5180.98] because that would have been a big, big problem.
[5182.08 → 5183.40] Oh, good old OCT.
[5183.40 → 5183.44] Okay.
[5185.28 → 5189.42] New egg reacts to a pricing error in the worst way, is my headline here.
[5189.50 → 5191.00] This was prepared by Riley Murdoch.
[5191.30 → 5199.36] As someone who has caused pricing errors in the past, I apologize in advance for the somewhat
[5199.36 → 5204.58] more sympathetic read that I might have on this.
[5204.58 → 5205.86] In fact, I'm going to let you do it.
[5205.90 → 5206.92] I haven't actually read this yet.
[5206.94 → 5207.92] I have no idea what happened.
[5207.98 → 5208.48] It's possible.
[5208.64 → 5215.06] It's just outrageous and inexcusable, but I made mistakes before, and I was very grateful
[5215.06 → 5218.04] when people didn't try to pin me to the wall for them.
[5219.56 → 5228.72] On August 7th, around 4 p.m. EST, there are some typos here, but New egg Canada listed a gigabyte
[5228.72 → 5239.04] RTX 3090 Ti model for $1,084.99, an $855 discount off of its previous $1,940.
[5239.80 → 5240.34] Nice.
[5240.34 → 5247.72] This deal was posted on r slash BAPCSalesCanada and RedFlagDeals.com.
[5248.02 → 5249.12] RedFlagDeals.com.
[5249.20 → 5250.28] That brings me back.
[5250.48 → 5256.14] RedFlagDeals was the bane of my existence when I was working as a product manager and was
[5256.14 → 5260.12] one of my top three bookmarks before I was a product manager.
[5260.26 → 5261.18] I also remembered that.
[5262.26 → 5262.82] Where many...
[5262.82 → 5264.92] I remember you talking about RedFlagDeals literally all the time.
[5264.92 → 5266.54] Man, RedFlagDeals was my jam.
[5266.64 → 5267.50] That was my haunt.
[5268.34 → 5272.58] NCI Forums and RedFlagDeals actually might have been my top two bookmarks back when I
[5272.58 → 5272.86] was...
[5272.86 → 5273.10] It was similar.
[5273.28 → 5274.96] I was just OCN and RedFlagDeals.
[5275.06 → 5275.20] Yeah.
[5276.16 → 5278.96] I was on RedFlagDeals, just not as much as you were.
[5279.12 → 5284.42] Where many users reported receiving order shipping confirmations for these graphics cards.
[5284.42 → 5289.88] Seems like almost everyone had their orders cancelled, and it appears that New egg forced
[5289.88 → 5295.18] an RMA slash return and told the shipping company to return packages to HQ.
[5296.64 → 5297.12] Okay.
[5297.58 → 5300.08] I'm going to have to look at that a little more closely.
[5300.22 → 5304.88] It's possible that's not quite how it went down, but I'll explain that in a little bit.
[5305.32 → 5308.90] Many contacted support and were told conflicting information.
[5309.18 → 5310.66] It's not a price error.
[5311.00 → 5312.56] Actually, it is a price error.
[5312.56 → 5320.88] The GPU was out of stock, even though it was in stock after all the packages had been returned.
[5321.20 → 5323.50] No, actually, the free game bundle was out of stock.
[5324.34 → 5324.82] Ada, Ada, Ada.
[5325.06 → 5329.24] RedFlagDeals looks exactly like it did 10 years ago, except with more ads.
[5329.24 → 5336.66] Some customers were charged for the game bundle price and given a $25 gift card for their trouble.
[5338.00 → 5343.56] New egg's actions may violate Canadian consumer rights law, which requires retailers to honour
[5343.56 → 5345.86] the lowest advertised price.
[5346.62 → 5348.68] In some cases, Quebec especially.
[5349.16 → 5352.52] Quebec always has special asterisks on literally everything.
[5352.52 → 5361.02] Judges have sided with the retailer in a case of extremely drastic price errors, like a computer
[5361.02 → 5364.04] being listed for $2, which was clearly an accident.
[5364.68 → 5366.46] But was it a pricing error?
[5366.62 → 5374.16] Earlier this week, VGA officially slashed 1K off of some of their RTX 3090 models.
[5374.50 → 5374.92] Crazy.
[5374.92 → 5375.00] Crazy.
[5376.12 → 5379.82] So, I have some speculation.
[5381.38 → 5383.20] So, take this for what it is.
[5383.40 → 5384.04] Speculation.
[5384.50 → 5394.12] For the shipping confirmations that were supposedly recalled, what is possible there is that the label was created.
[5394.32 → 5395.56] A lot of people don't know this.
[5395.92 → 5403.30] But when you get a shipping confirmation from a retailer, what that means is a tracking label has been created in the system.
[5403.30 → 5409.98] It does not mean that that consolidated palette of boxes has actually left the warehouse.
[5410.32 → 5418.72] So, it is quite possible that these were not actually shipped and therefore, from New egg's point of view, not shipped.
[5419.94 → 5429.06] Now, that doesn't necessarily make me lean one way or the other in terms of, you know, were their actions right or not right.
[5429.20 → 5431.44] It's just something that a lot of people misunderstand.
[5431.44 → 5436.70] They think that a shipping confirmation means the parcel is in the air.
[5437.30 → 5439.30] And it doesn't actually mean that.
[5441.10 → 5441.98] Another thing.
[5442.64 → 5443.18] Oh, shoot.
[5443.44 → 5444.36] What was I going to talk about?
[5445.06 → 5445.86] Oh, crap.
[5446.10 → 5446.90] There was another, man.
[5447.08 → 5448.24] There was another fascinating.
[5449.26 → 5449.98] Oh, yeah, right.
[5450.08 → 5453.02] So, the bit with customer support having different stories.
[5453.02 → 5455.92] That is pretty normal.
[5456.62 → 5461.42] And a company of that size, they would have probably multiple teams of customer support.
[5461.68 → 5467.58] And it is quite possible that some people thought one thing and others didn't get the memo.
[5467.80 → 5469.88] That's just pretty obviously human error.
[5470.16 → 5472.48] There are ways to fix that, New egg, by the way.
[5472.60 → 5472.76] Yeah.
[5472.76 → 5483.28] If you have a managed team-based CAN response system, and you see a problem coming in like this and someone orchestrates a CAN response, then the entire team gets the update, and it should all be unified.
[5483.40 → 5486.32] But one person might have sent out a different one before that happened.
[5486.70 → 5486.90] Yep.
[5487.70 → 5488.48] So, stuff happens.
[5488.72 → 5489.26] It's definitely possible.
[5489.36 → 5489.82] I'm just saying.
[5489.94 → 5490.02] Yeah.
[5490.02 → 5494.26] Now, here's where I get into super speculation territory.
[5496.00 → 5499.20] VGA officially slashed the price by $1,000, right?
[5499.68 → 5505.04] New egg discounted this GPU, this gigabyte GPU, by $855.
[5505.98 → 5519.52] Something I know about VGA from dealing with them is that aside from their policies, by and large, within the constraints of the industry they operate in because they don't have a ton of margin, by and large, they try to do the right damn thing.
[5520.02 → 5521.04] As a company.
[5521.52 → 5523.56] And that goes for end users.
[5523.74 → 5524.82] That also goes for partners.
[5525.62 → 5533.44] So, while it is possible that if it was an VGA GPU, they might have been able to...
[5533.44 → 5534.06] Okay, so hold on.
[5534.16 → 5537.60] First, it's very likely that if VGA is slashing the price by...
[5537.60 → 5538.16] Not very likely.
[5538.20 → 5538.70] It is a guarantee.
[5539.08 → 5543.18] If VGA is slashing the price by $1,000, NVIDIA adjusted the price.
[5543.84 → 5544.32] Period.
[5544.66 → 5545.46] That's how that works.
[5545.46 → 5549.68] VGA doesn't have $1,000 of margin in an RTI, in an anything.
[5550.30 → 5551.28] They just don't have it.
[5551.94 → 5554.56] So, NVIDIA altered the price.
[5555.20 → 5561.36] But, remember guys, NVIDIA has their own inventory of chips.
[5561.60 → 5563.08] And sometimes it's virtual inventory.
[5563.24 → 5564.94] It's allocations of future productions.
[5565.32 → 5570.22] In the case of the 3090 Ti, I suspect it's actual inventory, not allocations, because it seems to be overstocked.
[5570.22 → 5572.96] But NVIDIA has their own inventory.
[5573.32 → 5578.66] Then, once it reaches the board partner, there are different layers of inventory.
[5578.98 → 5582.54] They have inventory that is on allocation or is raw chips.
[5582.86 → 5586.48] They have inventory that is completed boards.
[5586.82 → 5590.06] They have inventory that is binned to a specific SKU.
[5590.44 → 5595.88] So, whether it's a super clock, or a super clock, or a super ultra clock, or whatever else.
[5596.34 → 5600.12] Then, they have inventory that is in their retail partners.
[5600.94 → 5610.90] So, the way to deal with all those different layers of inventory comes down to whatever the agreement was, whatever the purchase agreement was, for those GPUs.
[5611.26 → 5615.82] So, an example of how it might normally work would be that NVIDIA drops the price.
[5616.52 → 5624.82] And VGA goes, hey, we've got tens of thousands of these things sitting in our warehouse and sitting inbuilt and sitting built in our warehouse.
[5625.06 → 5627.10] What on earth are we supposed to do with these?
[5627.10 → 5641.94] And NVIDIA would, in those cases, typically, if there isn't a special arrangement, they would offer what's called price protection, or some kind of MDF, or kickback, or some way to take that new inventory and bring it down to the new cost.
[5641.94 → 5645.60] There are lots of creative ways that you can play around with to do this.
[5645.68 → 5650.24] Sometimes, they might, and I'm not saying NVIDIA does it this way, but I've seen lots of different strategies.
[5650.78 → 5655.40] Sometimes, they will simply offer you a credit on your next order.
[5655.40 → 5659.68] Very rarely, they would issue a cash back to you.
[5660.16 → 5676.06] Sometimes, if it's a smaller amount, and it's not critical to maintain your business, they might offer you an MDF, like a marketing discretionary funding, where you just have to send out some email blasts that promote whatever this brand is, and then they'll send you cash for that.
[5676.26 → 5678.10] However, they can justify it on their books.
[5678.10 → 5680.32] Another way they might do it is a blended cost.
[5680.76 → 5692.22] So, they might sell you this new lower-cost inventory at an even lower rate, so that you'll load up on more and push this new aggressively-priced product, and that'll help bring down the cost of your existing inventory.
[5692.32 → 5695.56] There's lots and lots of different strategies that you can use around this.
[5695.56 → 5705.40] And so, what I suspect is happening right now is some GPUs are being covered in such a way, and some of them are hanging in limbo.
[5705.62 → 5708.16] And it depends on whatever the agreement was.
[5708.40 → 5722.48] If I'm NVIDIA, and I'm clearing all of my old 7900 GTX GPUs to VGA, and I think it was one other partner, to rebadge as the GTO that was just like this weird one-off card, and I'm using this example because it's a very real-world example,
[5722.48 → 5730.34] it was so cheap, it was like $299 for what was essentially a GTX, which was a $500, $600 Canadian card at the time.
[5731.08 → 5733.68] What I suspect is that that's a final sale.
[5734.50 → 5736.00] No refunds, no exchanges.
[5736.56 → 5738.90] You want these old chips, right, when the new generation's coming in?
[5739.02 → 5739.76] You deal with them.
[5740.36 → 5745.28] But on a current-gen product, in order to support their partner, NVIDIA doesn't want their board partners going out of business, right?
[5745.34 → 5746.36] That's not good.
[5746.78 → 5749.08] They want them scraping by.
[5749.08 → 5750.76] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5750.86 → 5752.96] But they don't want them going out of business, right?
[5752.98 → 5756.68] They don't want the other teams to lose, but they want to win by as much as possible.
[5756.84 → 5763.60] So they would have some kind of price protection agreement in place on VGA's existing inventory.
[5763.98 → 5771.84] But where it gets a little bit more gray is what about VGA's inventory that belongs to a retailer?
[5772.00 → 5773.36] What about a retailer's stock?
[5773.36 → 5782.72] So that comes down to that board partner's specific agreement, not just with that retailer, but maybe even for that specific shipment.
[5783.34 → 5795.30] Maybe these are ancient, ancient cards, these gigabyte cards at New egg that were bought back at the peak of the GPU crisis that were sold as is.
[5795.94 → 5797.84] No, you guys got your allocation.
[5798.32 → 5799.66] These things move on their own.
[5799.66 → 5808.14] We don't want any part of it, and that was part of the condition for a price or an allocation or a promotion or whatever the case may be, right?
[5808.40 → 5811.60] It's possible that that's where the wires got crossed.
[5811.68 → 5816.50] And I realize it sounds very convoluted to you guys, but these are very real things that really happen.
[5816.88 → 5820.78] So maybe VGA went to New egg and was like, hey, we're price protecting everything.
[5821.02 → 5822.40] Let's get the new prices in place.
[5822.46 → 5822.82] Don't worry.
[5822.88 → 5823.44] We got you.
[5823.74 → 5824.80] Maybe gigabyte didn't.
[5824.92 → 5826.32] Maybe there was a different arrangement there.
[5826.32 → 5839.98] Maybe someone went and started making price adjustments to ensure that all of their 3090TIs were in line with the rest of the industry thinking, oh, well, it should be fine because we're going to get MDF, or we're going to get price protection back on all of this stuff.
[5840.04 → 5840.92] So we'll deal with it later.
[5841.20 → 5847.80] But maybe they didn't realize that the PM had struck a special deal on these particular cards and there wasn't going to be any price protection.
[5847.80 → 5851.64] So was it a pricing error?
[5851.74 → 5852.58] Almost certainly.
[5853.26 → 5856.84] But was it a pricing error where they just like fat-fingered the keyboard?
[5857.00 → 5866.00] I suspect that's very unlikely looking at the size of the discount and the other moves that are being made by other players in the same space.
[5866.80 → 5868.98] That's my takeaway.
[5868.98 → 5878.58] As for them lying about stock and leaving customers with $25 gift cards, at the end of the day, I think it's going to come down to a court.
[5878.58 → 5888.68] If people ultimately do decide to pursue legal action, I think it's going to come down to a court to decide if this constitutes a reasonable expectation that the price was accurate.
[5888.88 → 5890.46] Because in Canada, that's the bar.
[5890.72 → 5896.48] The main thing that bugs me is like forcing a return and giving them all their money back is like very annoying.
[5896.48 → 5899.50] Yeah, but they didn't like scam you.
[5899.60 → 5901.82] They wasted your time, which has a value.
[5902.02 → 5902.98] They definitely wasted your time.
[5903.28 → 5906.60] The one that bugs me is this line right here.
[5906.92 → 5917.54] Some customers were charged the game bundle price, which is I think means the non-discounted price, and were given a $25 gift card for their trouble.
[5917.88 → 5919.52] And then there's just like a little smiley face.
[5919.52 → 5926.92] If that's the full price, and then they gave them a $25 gift card for their trouble, that's some like major BS.
[5928.40 → 5930.90] I want to like to look into this a little bit more.
[5931.20 → 5932.54] So we'll see what happens.
[5933.92 → 5937.70] There's the inside baseball of what might have gone down.
[5937.70 → 5942.34] I hope that it was an innocent mistake.
[5942.78 → 5946.78] I hope that nobody actually ended up out any money over this.
[5947.28 → 5950.90] And I sympathize with anyone's disappointment in not getting the deal.
[5951.40 → 5952.42] Bad situation.
[5952.78 → 5956.32] So they weren't charged the full price of the pre-discount.
[5956.54 → 5960.50] They were charged $160 for the game bundle.
[5960.50 → 5964.98] And then given a $25 gift card.
[5965.46 → 5972.72] And there's a response to it that says that it has a credit card chargeback written all over it.
[5972.98 → 5974.26] And it sure does.
[5976.06 → 5976.50] Yeah.
[5976.70 → 5977.08] I don't know.
[5977.62 → 5978.28] Not great.
[5979.10 → 5979.94] Not great.
[5983.14 → 5983.80] All right.
[5983.90 → 5986.04] I'm just going to do this.
[5988.72 → 5990.30] I didn't want to bring this up.
[5991.02 → 5998.64] But I've been put in a position where I feel like I have to.
[6007.18 → 6008.42] When was this?
[6009.50 → 6010.14] Hold on.
[6010.18 → 6010.64] Let me check.
[6010.80 → 6012.28] I don't have my email open anymore.
[6012.38 → 6013.88] I'm pretty sure it was in 2018 though.
[6014.50 → 6020.86] In 2018, I was heading to Shenzhen in China for a OnePlus sponsored video.
[6021.46 → 6025.98] On the way over, I believe it was, it might have been Colton.
[6026.18 → 6035.36] I think it was someone from our team that suggested, this was right around the time that Scotty from Strange Parts was blowing up with his like rebuilt iPhone stuff.
[6035.36 → 6036.18] Stuff like that.
[6036.18 → 6041.00] So someone on our team had suggested I reach out to Scotty about doing some kind of collab.
[6041.08 → 6041.44] Was it you?
[6041.94 → 6042.42] Oh, all right.
[6042.52 → 6044.76] Well, apparently I think you're Colton now.
[6045.06 → 6045.44] Hey, nice.
[6045.92 → 6049.22] I mean, it might have been multiple people, but I pushed pretty hard for it.
[6049.22 → 6064.78] Anyway, on the way over, I also heard from a YouTuber slash content creator, because, you know, YouTube's a bit of a gray area over in China, named Naomi Wu, who I was like, wow, this is so serendipitous.
[6064.78 → 6066.08] I'm literally on a plane.
[6067.00 → 6068.32] This is great.
[6069.50 → 6070.86] I'm heading over there.
[6070.96 → 6073.52] Who was interested in joining Float plane?
[6075.70 → 6078.18] So I suggested a collab while I was there.
[6078.28 → 6084.28] My idea was a studio tour, because I assumed she had like kind of a cool maker space or something.
[6084.66 → 6086.80] She said it was at her home and her boyfriend wouldn't be around.
[6087.24 → 6088.32] Okay, fair enough.
[6090.72 → 6093.22] How about we just meet up and talk about Float plane then?
[6093.22 → 6095.26] I'll be back at my hotel in the evening.
[6095.42 → 6096.10] We could meet there.
[6096.26 → 6097.24] She didn't want to.
[6097.40 → 6098.46] And I want to stress this.
[6098.78 → 6100.88] That is totally fair.
[6101.32 → 6102.96] There's different cultural norms.
[6103.20 → 6106.72] There are different thresholds for what constitutes a public meeting place.
[6107.12 → 6114.14] For me, I thought a hotel lobby is a very public meeting place, but everyone has a different perception.
[6114.82 → 6122.30] And I want to make it while I want to make it clear that I said nothing about my room and I had no intention of doing anything other than pitching Float plane.
[6122.30 → 6137.20] I respect that women, man, in the tech industry in particular, run into unsolicited advances from who are supposed to be professional contacts a lot.
[6137.20 → 6144.56] Now, with all of that said, let me see if I can find my thing here.
[6144.56 → 6148.90] This is what was tweeted.
[6150.10 → 6151.56] Good gravy.
[6151.68 → 6154.06] Was this actually three years later?
[6155.06 → 6155.42] Okay.
[6155.68 → 6167.20] Well, at any rate, this is what Naomi tweeted three years later in response to a video that we posted on 3D printing chocolate.
[6167.20 → 6170.52] Um, he had no interest in the 3D print mill.
[6170.74 → 6171.02] Really?
[6172.76 → 6173.08] Eh.
[6173.32 → 6176.48] I passed in the evening hotel visit when Linus was in Shenzhen.
[6176.60 → 6182.98] It's one of those I'd really have preferred you hadn't done that because it could have been totally innocent, and you could be a 100% perfectly decent guy.
[6183.14 → 6185.52] But I'll always question if that cost me things.
[6186.00 → 6191.20] My response to this was a textbook horrible, horrible response.
[6191.20 → 6198.34] The truth is, I am an emotional creature sometimes.
[6199.20 → 6202.88] The implication of that tweet was pretty clear to me.
[6203.00 → 6207.76] The words evening hotel visit had a pretty clear meaning to me.
[6208.54 → 6212.00] So, I responded in the worst possible way.
[6212.38 → 6216.18] I said, we discussed it, the 3D printer, during our writers meeting.
[6216.28 → 6218.36] Couldn't come up with a good project for it for the time being.
[6218.36 → 6219.66] So, we put it on ice.
[6220.22 → 6224.42] Even with the novelty factor, the chocolate printer is our second worst performing out of our last 10 videos.
[6224.62 → 6225.52] And it's a common thing.
[6225.76 → 6226.36] Sad face.
[6227.24 → 6230.32] Then I said, also, my reputation is impeccable.
[6230.52 → 6232.34] So, this probably doesn't even merit acknowledgement.
[6232.52 → 6234.14] But are you even serious right now?
[6234.82 → 6237.62] Video of me wrapping my other collab at night.
[6237.96 → 6242.84] But I guess trying to squeeze in a float plane meeting before my morning flight is an evening hotel visit.
[6243.52 → 6244.86] Snoring, smiley.
[6244.86 → 6249.76] By the way, I find it ironic that you've got recent tweets about the potential damage to baseless accusations.
[6250.22 → 6259.22] That was not a good response because I didn't do a good job of acknowledging the inherent risk in just being a woman.
[6259.72 → 6260.38] Going anywhere.
[6262.88 → 6263.52] Yeah.
[6263.84 → 6264.82] It sucked.
[6265.16 → 6266.06] Terrible response.
[6266.06 → 6267.06] Terrible response.
[6267.06 → 6279.66] However, what I ultimately decided to do at that point was just gone, okay, well, it's pretty clear that we're pretty far away in terms of what happened here.
[6281.18 → 6283.70] I've said my piece, which is no.
[6284.60 → 6286.94] And I just don't really have anything else to say.
[6287.20 → 6290.24] And honestly, if I open my mouth again, I'm probably going to make it worse.
[6290.24 → 6296.02] So I have not opened my mouth making things worse until now.
[6299.34 → 6310.50] Because in the wake of the backpack warranty saga, somehow this turned into something to do with Naomi.
[6311.18 → 6311.96] I don't know.
[6312.22 → 6313.62] It has something to do with 4chan.
[6313.88 → 6315.48] It's not a site I spend time on.
[6315.74 → 6316.88] I just don't know.
[6316.88 → 6321.84] And here is how the story has changed.
[6324.88 → 6327.00] Let me just bring this up.
[6331.40 → 6336.68] Imagine for a minute, a woman said, I'm not really comfortable coming to your hotel at night.
[6337.00 → 6338.12] And you were professional.
[6338.68 → 6343.00] Told her, regretted you had no other time this trip, but would follow up via email.
[6343.60 → 6343.92] Nope.
[6344.30 → 6344.78] Ghosted.
[6346.88 → 6348.68] Men don't creep because they can have professional.
[6348.74 → 6351.82] So this is responding to another tweet.
[6352.94 → 6353.30] Okay.
[6354.50 → 6356.20] That didn't happen.
[6357.66 → 6359.50] Now we're past implications.
[6359.50 → 6366.80] And we're into utterly baseless accounts of events.
[6366.80 → 6379.44] So in the interest of transparency, I have screenshotted before the show my entire communication history with this particular individual.
[6380.72 → 6382.08] So let's go ahead.
[6382.18 → 6382.96] That happened through email.
[6383.18 → 6384.98] Was there any communication not in email?
[6385.14 → 6385.38] Yes.
[6385.40 → 6387.98] There was some communication through not email.
[6388.36 → 6389.84] But that's in here.
[6390.04 → 6390.46] Oh, okay.
[6390.46 → 6393.20] So I say when we switch over.
[6394.40 → 6395.20] All right.
[6395.20 → 6399.72] So at some point in the trip, I sent you WeChat requests.
[6399.80 → 6401.32] So we did correspond via WeChat.
[6401.66 → 6404.42] That was where we ultimately decided not to meet up.
[6405.06 → 6405.40] Okay.
[6405.40 → 6408.48] Then when I returned.
[6408.66 → 6410.00] So this is one week later.
[6410.50 → 6411.22] Here we go.
[6411.86 → 6412.22] All right.
[6412.26 → 6414.10] I'm back, and my jet lag is better now.
[6414.56 → 6416.82] Did you want to have a call about this at some point this week?
[6416.92 → 6417.92] What day is good for you?
[6418.00 → 6421.74] I can walk you through the details, show you how the platform works, and hopefully get you signed up.
[6421.86 → 6422.50] Smiley face.
[6423.28 → 6428.66] Sure, if that works best, my listening comprehension, et cetera, this time works.
[6429.18 → 6432.52] If that works for you, I can chat tonight in about an hour.
[6432.62 → 6433.42] It is now the next day.
[6433.48 → 6436.40] It is April 18th at 4.45 p.m.
[6436.48 → 6437.38] What platform works best?
[6437.44 → 6438.38] Can you use WhatsApp voice?
[6438.50 → 6439.36] Do you still have WeChat?
[6439.48 → 6440.22] I have WeChat.
[6440.34 → 6441.08] Didn't see a voice option.
[6441.14 → 6442.12] If it has it, that's fine.
[6442.22 → 6443.06] It does talk soon.
[6444.10 → 6447.54] Then I sent a follow-up email after our voice conversation.
[6448.00 → 6449.54] This is super nice that I have this.
[6449.54 → 6455.12] Per our conversation, future incidents of illegal actions like doxing would be likely to result in disciplinary action.
[6455.24 → 6459.50] We want to be an open and welcoming platform, but we cannot allow illegal activity to take place on our site.
[6460.00 → 6464.40] Right now, we only have a $3 tier with early video access.
[6464.94 → 6466.00] You can decide how early.
[6466.08 → 6467.76] We are doing one week early for Linus Tech Tips.
[6468.34 → 6472.64] In the future, we will offer more support tiers with higher resolution video so you can charge more,
[6472.78 → 6474.48] and also no video so you can charge less.
[6474.48 → 6478.78] The basic tiers without early access videos should be quite a bit cheaper for people who just want to support you.
[6478.78 → 6481.38] I have CCD Vaughn in this email who will help you with payment options.
[6481.84 → 6483.82] Please let her know how you were handling it through Patreon.
[6484.22 → 6486.06] She will also, because China, right?
[6486.64 → 6488.44] She will also provide you with a creator contract.
[6488.58 → 6491.58] Please read it through and return it signed if you'd like to come on board.
[6492.78 → 6502.46] So, the bit about how I supposedly ghosted her is just an utter fabrication.
[6502.46 → 6507.40] I don't really know what else to say about that other than what.
[6508.76 → 6509.44] All right.
[6510.00 → 6510.84] It gets better.
[6512.42 → 6513.80] Ba-BA-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[6516.32 → 6516.76] Oops.
[6516.92 → 6518.40] No, that's the same one again.
[6519.02 → 6519.38] Okay.
[6520.18 → 6521.46] This is an interesting one.
[6523.36 → 6525.92] Or literally just, oh, s***.
[6525.92 → 6527.60] Oh, not like that.
[6527.66 → 6528.08] My bad.
[6528.18 → 6530.56] Listen, let's do this over email or chat when I get back.
[6530.72 → 6533.70] I didn't even think this through when I said I was really uncomfortable.
[6534.28 → 6534.92] No problem.
[6535.14 → 6535.40] Nope.
[6535.72 → 6536.16] Ghosted.
[6536.42 → 6538.64] And if I said anything about it, gotta blame me.
[6538.84 → 6539.04] Okay.
[6539.14 → 6539.96] So, I did.
[6540.40 → 6543.44] We did chat about it via email when I got back.
[6543.84 → 6544.92] So, that's good.
[6545.58 → 6546.28] I guess.
[6546.98 → 6548.48] And then, where was it?
[6548.62 → 6549.02] Blah, blah, blah.
[6549.16 → 6549.60] Ah, yes.
[6549.64 → 6550.08] Here we go.
[6550.20 → 6553.68] Did he CC his wife with his evening invitation to his hotel?
[6553.68 → 6555.96] No, he removed her from the conversation.
[6556.28 → 6556.98] Ah, okay.
[6557.06 → 6558.86] Well, why don't we revisit the screen capture?
[6559.56 → 6566.36] What actually happened was Yvonne was not in the conversation from the initial outreach.
[6566.98 → 6574.80] And what I actually did was got back home and added my wife.
[6576.82 → 6581.96] So, once again, no, that did not happen.
[6581.96 → 6583.96] All right.
[6589.34 → 6594.44] And there it goes.
[6594.52 → 6596.34] Actually, it's my fault for not understanding.
[6596.46 → 6599.64] He has to drop his wife from conversation and make my access to float plane conditional
[6599.64 → 6601.18] and visiting his hotel room at night.
[6601.18 → 6608.72] Oh, Chloe asks, you pride yourself on honesty and transparency.
[6608.92 → 6609.90] What's the deal with this?
[6611.64 → 6612.04] This.
[6612.64 → 6614.60] A thing that didn't happen.
[6615.98 → 6617.56] In fact, hold on.
[6617.62 → 6618.24] Let's go.
[6619.04 → 6619.88] Let's go here.
[6619.88 → 6621.58] Oh, no.
[6621.66 → 6625.16] This is just asking for advice on sponsorships.
[6626.90 → 6628.16] Blah, blah, blah.
[6629.50 → 6632.16] We generate baseline views per video.
[6633.00 → 6635.94] It's just giving some guidance on how much you can charge for sponsorships.
[6636.72 → 6638.06] Some guidance on conversion.
[6638.06 → 6641.50] This is all ancient numbers.
[6642.02 → 6644.38] So, don't read too much into it in terms of like float plane.
[6645.18 → 6645.28] Yeah.
[6645.34 → 6649.72] Just even hearing the guidance on how float plane is used is like, yeah, this was a...
[6649.72 → 6650.40] This is ancient.
[6650.52 → 6651.18] This is 2018.
[6651.46 → 6652.74] This is literally over four years ago.
[6652.90 → 6653.78] Quite a few minutes ago.
[6653.78 → 6655.86] I forget what this...
[6655.86 → 6657.10] I forget what the implication was here.
[6657.16 → 6657.48] Yeah, yeah.
[6657.52 → 6658.44] So, that's not what happened.
[6658.68 → 6659.58] I thought we had a deal.
[6659.64 → 6660.92] We literally sent over our contract.
[6661.34 → 6663.84] So, that's not how it went.
[6665.92 → 6666.28] Okay.
[6666.46 → 6667.18] This is...
[6667.18 → 6669.40] This is an important lesson.
[6671.36 → 6672.64] Who was CC'd?
[6672.76 → 6675.82] Last time, Linus offered me float plane, but I have to go to his hotel at night.
[6675.92 → 6678.94] I can start paying rent again, but he can only see me at night in his hotel.
[6679.80 → 6682.00] I think it was pretty gross to try.
[6682.40 → 6682.70] Yeah.
[6683.78 → 6685.50] Okay.
[6686.22 → 6686.62] Yeah.
[6686.72 → 6688.36] Oh, that's an interesting implication.
[6689.42 → 6694.28] Who was CC'd in our email conversations because I'm very careful about such things.
[6694.70 → 6700.40] Until he found out about his trip to Shenzhen, and then she got dropped, and he moved to chat.
[6702.58 → 6703.38] Uh...
[6703.38 → 6705.12] No.
[6706.34 → 6706.86] Nope.
[6707.06 → 6707.52] Just no.
[6707.74 → 6709.40] That's just completely not what happened.
[6709.40 → 6717.82] Part of being careful about email conversations would be checking your email conversations to see what happened.
[6718.62 → 6720.48] Because that is not what happened at all.
[6720.64 → 6721.04] Even a little.
[6722.94 → 6724.88] His explanation is he has an impeccable reputation.
[6725.02 → 6725.84] Yeah, that was a bad explanation.
[6726.84 → 6727.24] That was bad.
[6727.44 → 6727.64] Yep.
[6727.64 → 6729.86] I maintain it was a sh** thing to do.
[6729.98 → 6730.18] Yep.
[6730.36 → 6730.76] You know what?
[6730.90 → 6731.34] Fair enough.
[6731.50 → 6731.80] This is...
[6731.80 → 6732.28] Here we go.
[6732.54 → 6733.28] Here is a...
[6733.28 → 6734.32] This is a...
[6734.32 → 6735.08] This is a truth.
[6736.24 → 6738.18] And ghosting me after the fact made it even more suspect?
[6738.44 → 6738.72] No.
[6738.94 → 6739.18] No.
[6739.42 → 6739.64] No.
[6739.76 → 6740.64] That's not what happened.
[6741.20 → 6743.46] He's not going to own it was poorly handled, and that's fine.
[6743.68 → 6744.24] I own it.
[6744.24 → 6748.12] Part of it was poorly handled, but the other part is just not...
[6748.12 → 6749.34] That's just not true.
[6749.42 → 6750.06] You weren't ghosted.
[6751.60 → 6752.04] Yeah.
[6754.80 → 6756.04] Do-do-do-do.
[6756.20 → 6756.84] Do-do-do.
[6757.84 → 6758.56] No, man.
[6758.64 → 6759.16] It's just...
[6759.16 → 6760.54] Man, this was quite the tweet storm.
[6760.74 → 6761.98] We never chatted regularly.
[6762.20 → 6767.28] That email and then the one very short chain asking about reviewing the 3D printer.
[6767.56 → 6773.36] The phone conversation and the WeChat trying to arrange a time to meet up is it.
[6773.36 → 6774.86] That's the extent of our contact.
[6775.88 → 6780.96] How many of you going from regular chat slash email to zero contact after you decline a
[6780.96 → 6781.80] late night hotel visit?
[6781.90 → 6784.28] What regular chat and email?
[6784.44 → 6785.54] I literally...
[6785.54 → 6787.46] The first outreach was while I was on the plane.
[6788.48 → 6790.38] It was within hours.
[6791.86 → 6794.88] A lot of communication with other creators happened specifically around a trip.
[6796.16 → 6797.40] Oh, I got one more bit.
[6797.46 → 6797.88] This is good.
[6798.12 → 6799.34] I was busy shooting all day.
[6799.52 → 6800.98] That is what I said.
[6800.98 → 6806.04] Yes, you decided to come to Shenzhen and do a collab with a white guy, not a local Chinese
[6806.04 → 6810.10] woman in tech YouTuber, and have a white guy show you around the electronics market and
[6810.10 → 6814.12] save the Chinese girl for the only time left, late night hotel visits.
[6814.12 → 6818.12] So, what actually happened...
[6819.34 → 6821.60] Let me see if I can find it.
[6821.66 → 6822.16] Here we go.
[6823.38 → 6823.92] Oh, man.
[6824.00 → 6825.36] I don't have a game.
[6825.38 → 6825.78] Oh, yeah.
[6825.88 → 6826.78] Good time for a reminder.
[6827.04 → 6830.70] This is pointed out by someone in Float plane Chat, but that is a good idea, and it's a good
[6830.70 → 6831.32] time for a reminder.
[6831.90 → 6833.12] Do not go after...
[6833.78 → 6835.12] That would be really stupid.
[6835.28 → 6836.56] That would be incredibly dumb.
[6836.96 → 6837.70] Do not bug her.
[6837.80 → 6838.74] Do not harass her.
[6840.78 → 6841.98] It shouldn't have to be said.
[6842.30 → 6842.46] Yeah.
[6842.46 → 6843.62] Just leave it alone.
[6843.72 → 6844.18] Scotty Allen.
[6844.48 → 6844.62] Do not be a jerk.
[6844.86 → 6847.48] That will not help in any way at all.
[6847.56 → 6848.04] Be nice.
[6848.30 → 6849.34] Strange Parts Shenzhen.
[6849.64 → 6850.52] Thanks for reaching out.
[6850.74 → 6851.42] WhatsApp is this.
[6851.54 → 6852.36] WeChat's good too.
[6852.84 → 6855.46] If you've got some time and want to tour the markets or just want to meet up for a beer
[6855.46 → 6856.52] or something, let me know.
[6857.04 → 6857.98] Would love to meet up.
[6858.24 → 6859.64] We're in town for our sponsored gig.
[6859.72 → 6863.90] This is April the 9th with OnePlus, but we're totally down to make some other videos.
[6864.14 → 6868.22] I saw your tweet saying you'd love to show some cool techie places, and after we chat
[6868.22 → 6870.68] for a little bit, I'm sure we could find a cooler fun angle.
[6870.68 → 6873.66] I need to have a look at my scheduling, but it would likely be in the evening.
[6873.90 → 6875.56] What's your next couple of days look like?
[6875.86 → 6878.96] I'll switch to WhatsApp when I land, but I wanted to get this message off to you so you
[6878.96 → 6880.14] know I got yours.
[6881.06 → 6881.46] Nope.
[6881.68 → 6885.02] It was just my schedule was really busy.
[6885.16 → 6887.32] And no, I didn't go there to collab with Scotty.
[6887.40 → 6890.42] I went there to shoot the OnePlus Factory tour.
[6890.54 → 6891.66] That's why I was actually there.
[6891.70 → 6894.54] It was an extremely tight schedule.
[6894.54 → 6900.26] Um, and we were also trying to do a video that never ended up getting published about
[6900.26 → 6903.06] how to circumvent the Great Firewall.
[6903.28 → 6907.64] So I had the OnePlus video, which was a multi-day project.
[6907.88 → 6911.64] I've actually got my itinerary here for the trip.
[6912.22 → 6914.16] Uh, but, but, but, here it is.
[6914.36 → 6917.98] Oh man, this is really inconvenient the way that Google Docs handles Zoom now.
[6918.32 → 6920.14] Here is my itinerary.
[6920.48 → 6921.14] Pretty busy.
[6921.14 → 6926.36] I arrived the evening before April 11th, worked all day, had a work dinner.
[6927.04 → 6932.16] Then on April 12th, um, I was up in the morning, not too early in the morning.
[6932.26 → 6936.02] You got to remember, I'm like nine hours out of my regular time zone or something stupid
[6936.02 → 6936.58] like that.
[6936.90 → 6937.78] Work all day.
[6937.96 → 6943.74] And then this is when I ended up going to the market with Scotty, uh, not with OnePlus.
[6944.48 → 6947.18] Uh, so I turned what was supposed to be a OnePlus thing in.
[6947.44 → 6948.42] Uh, very gracious hosts.
[6948.52 → 6949.20] Thank you very much.
[6949.20 → 6950.78] Uh, particularly shout out Nicole.
[6951.14 → 6955.40] Um, I turned that into a video for myself, and I was like, I don't know, maybe I'll mention
[6955.40 → 6956.00] them or something.
[6956.38 → 6956.92] Mention OnePlus.
[6957.56 → 6959.06] Uh, but it was, it was really tight.
[6959.18 → 6961.86] And as you guys probably saw in that video, I wasn't at my best.
[6961.96 → 6963.68] I pushed myself really hard on that trip.
[6963.94 → 6969.14] And there were a lot of people that commented that I was, that I was rude or cranky or whatever
[6969.14 → 6970.32] else in that video.
[6970.68 → 6975.16] Uh, if you look closely, you'll probably notice that it was actually night by the time Scotty
[6975.16 → 6975.72] and I finished.
[6975.72 → 6981.04] So it was just a really tight trip and I didn't have a lot of time.
[6981.12 → 6983.58] That's just all there is to it.
[6983.68 → 6988.40] And my flight out the next morning, I've got my, got my ticket here as well, was at 1115,
[6988.40 → 6991.46] which sounds like I've got a lot of time in the morning, but not, not really.
[6991.66 → 6992.34] You have to like pack.
[6992.34 → 6994.18] You have to back up all your media.
[6994.20 → 6995.74] It's very international as well.
[6995.94 → 6998.02] Um, well, no, no, it was a domestic flight first.
[6998.12 → 6998.92] Actually, I don't remember.
[6999.52 → 7003.26] I, I, I tend to err on the side of, I need to get home from China.
[7003.26 → 7004.98] Like when I'm very, very far away.
[7005.46 → 7007.02] So I'm always there.
[7007.08 → 7012.02] I've, I've had my, uh, flights get missed because of like really unfortunate things before.
[7012.12 → 7014.36] So I'm always there like three plus hours early.
[7014.36 → 7017.48] So no, there, there wasn't time the next morning either.
[7018.22 → 7027.56] Um, so there, uh, the first time around with this, the implication of impropriety was there,
[7027.56 → 7032.84] but there still seemed to be an awareness that the perception of wrongdoing was a perception
[7032.84 → 7036.46] rather than something that I actually said or did.
[7036.66 → 7038.82] Uh, my response was cringe.
[7039.26 → 7042.26] Uh, but I got completely blind sided by this.
[7042.34 → 7043.56] I had no idea what else to say.
[7043.56 → 7048.36] Uh, my bad, as we've talked about a lot today, I'm not exactly the king of PR.
[7048.94 → 7055.76] Um, at this point though, it's clear that, uh, the story has morphed in a very significant,
[7055.76 → 7063.90] very, um, very harmful, very negative, um, way that, that is not connected with the reality
[7063.90 → 7065.32] of what happened on that trip.
[7065.68 → 7069.50] Uh, I, I can't speculate about Naomi's motivations in any of this.
[7069.58 → 7072.04] I just want to set the facts straight.
[7072.04 → 7075.18] I tried to schedule a meeting when I was on a very tight timeline.
[7075.48 → 7077.08] We were not able to make it work.
[7077.94 → 7083.38] The truth is I also wasn't super comfortable navigating an unfamiliar city at night without
[7083.38 → 7084.00] Google Maps.
[7084.00 → 7090.72] So I had my own concerns about meeting some random place, and she wasn't comfortable meeting
[7090.72 → 7091.46] in a hotel lobby.
[7092.10 → 7093.86] Fair play stuff happens.
[7094.38 → 7095.84] We weren't able to make it work.
[7095.84 → 7101.72] Where we're really running into trouble here is that the claim is that because that meeting
[7101.72 → 7106.58] didn't happen, I somehow ghosted or withheld float plane access or anything.
[7106.70 → 7109.26] That's, that's just completely, that's a complete fabrication.
[7109.48 → 7114.82] I don't, I don't know how this has happened, especially when these are just, these are emails.
[7115.06 → 7118.08] Presumably she has access to the same email chain that I do.
[7118.08 → 7120.72] So I don't, um, I don't know.
[7122.02 → 7125.10] So, so having them, she can check for herself.
[7125.44 → 7127.44] She can also know that I have them.
[7128.02 → 7130.56] Why would, I don't know.
[7130.84 → 7136.32] There's also the yeah, the implications with the hotel, but, um, it's not to the room.
[7136.66 → 7142.24] Inviting, inviting almost anyone up to your room can always be kind of a weird moment.
[7142.82 → 7143.38] Which I didn't.
[7143.38 → 7144.20] Yeah, no, I know.
[7144.36 → 7144.58] I know.
[7144.88 → 7150.58] I'm just on my, so like I've, I've had a bunch of random, I filmed a video, um, talking to
[7150.58 → 7155.10] a bunch of tech creators in my hotel room once at an NVIDIA event, but it was like Paul and
[7155.10 → 7157.06] Kyle, and I've been friends with those guys for years.
[7157.06 → 7158.52] So it didn't really matter.
[7158.94 → 7160.06] I think Jay was there too.
[7160.18 → 7161.26] It's been a long time.
[7161.72 → 7170.06] Um, but like in regard to other, um, women, I'm trying to think.
[7170.06 → 7176.36] Yeah, I've met with some in lobbies, but I think it's basically always been my, like,
[7177.00 → 7182.40] my, like, uh, sponsor contact at the event, and they're staying in the same hotel building
[7182.40 → 7182.90] that I am.
[7182.96 → 7184.22] So like, it just made sense.
[7184.36 → 7190.72] Other than that, um, it's, it's, it's a tough, it's a tough road to be on because you have
[7190.72 → 7194.80] to remember how things are going to be perceived by the other party.
[7194.80 → 7201.78] But when you have no bad intentions, it's sometimes hard to recognize that bad intentions
[7201.78 → 7202.62] might be interpreted.
[7202.86 → 7203.34] Sure.
[7203.42 → 7207.60] So it's, it's a it's a tough thing to, it's tough ground to kind of navigate.
[7207.60 → 7211.94] There's also the, the implications, like it was mentioned at times in here, like, oh,
[7212.36 → 7214.30] paying my rent is, is difficult.
[7214.50 → 7218.88] That can add pressure in these types of situations, but that's another thing that's going to be
[7218.88 → 7223.06] extremely hard to have optics on as the person inviting someone to something else.
[7223.06 → 7226.30] Um, it's, it's a very tough landscape.
[7226.76 → 7229.74] Um, and yeah.
[7230.00 → 7230.38] Yeah.
[7230.42 → 7237.36] I mean, clearly, clearly I, I did, I did not nail the, you know, the, the cultural norm
[7237.36 → 7239.48] of meeting in a hotel lobby here.
[7239.72 → 7240.30] Super normal.
[7240.94 → 7243.40] Um, like they're set up for it.
[7243.52 → 7246.28] There are tables and meeting rooms.
[7246.28 → 7250.50] Well, just aside from meeting rooms, like there are just places to sit and talk to people.
[7250.50 → 7251.60] I meant just meeting areas.
[7251.74 → 7251.86] Yeah.
[7251.96 → 7252.12] Sure.
[7252.12 → 7257.00] Um, you know, if that's not normal in China, it was news to me.
[7257.36 → 7260.72] I, you know, I, I was either my first or second time to China.
[7260.82 → 7263.14] Like I hadn't spent a bunch of time there or anything like that.
[7263.50 → 7268.62] Uh, you know, I did have experience meeting with, you know, Chinese business partners here
[7268.62 → 7274.44] and, you know, whether it's in Las Vegas at CES or, um, you know, whether it's, uh, actually,
[7274.52 → 7275.00] okay.
[7275.00 → 7281.62] One super weird meeting that I had, um, was at the, uh, at the hotel at YVR airport.
[7282.34 → 7286.46] They were in town on the way somewhere else, had a layover and were like, Hey, can we meet?
[7286.46 → 7288.16] So we met in the hotel lobby there?
[7288.16 → 7289.96] Like it's, it's happened a lot to me.
[7289.96 → 7294.06] So I didn't, I didn't think for a second that that was not a completely normal thing.
[7294.06 → 7298.26] And yeah, I didn't handle that well last time around, but.
[7298.26 → 7302.50] All this other stuff.
[7302.92 → 7303.32] Wow.
[7304.66 → 7305.06] Wow.
[7305.46 → 7305.66] Yeah.
[7305.68 → 7309.68] Even then, like you can, you can super define that it's the lobby, but like, yeah, I don't.
[7309.80 → 7310.78] And I probably didn't.
[7311.02 → 7312.32] I probably thought it was obvious.
[7312.38 → 7313.22] But you didn't say room.
[7313.30 → 7313.72] But I don't remember.
[7314.06 → 7314.46] No.
[7314.76 → 7315.04] Right.
[7315.06 → 7315.88] And that's a big difference.
[7315.88 → 7316.44] Good gravy.
[7316.56 → 7316.76] No.
[7316.84 → 7317.96] That's a very big difference.
[7318.56 → 7319.86] Um, yeah.
[7320.30 → 7320.68] I don't know.
[7321.34 → 7321.72] All right.
[7323.12 → 7324.38] Do we have anything else?
[7324.50 → 7325.66] Let's move on.
[7325.88 → 7327.72] Back to the WAN show document.
[7327.72 → 7329.78] We're talking about other things.
[7330.22 → 7332.02] Uh, uh, something.
[7332.26 → 7333.30] There's got to be something.
[7333.42 → 7334.06] There's got to be something.
[7334.18 → 7334.40] It works.
[7334.52 → 7335.18] Worst case scenario.
[7335.38 → 7336.92] Oh, there's Meta's tracking you.
[7338.00 → 7338.88] I think.
[7339.18 → 7344.66] In a in an article that everyone was really surprised to hear about, um, Instagram and
[7344.66 → 7346.32] Facebook's use of in-app.
[7346.62 → 7347.98] You want to get that?
[7348.22 → 7352.18] Uh, Instagram and Facebook's use of in, of an in-app browser within.
[7352.82 → 7353.38] Whoa.
[7353.42 → 7354.16] This is written oddly.
[7354.16 → 7361.36] Instagram and Facebook's use of in-app browser within both iOS apps track interactions with
[7361.36 → 7362.20] external websites.
[7362.36 → 7364.14] This includes passwords.
[7364.34 → 7364.46] Okay.
[7364.48 → 7365.78] That one's actually pretty surprising.
[7366.10 → 7371.56] It's includes passwords, addresses, ad clicks, text selection, screenshots, and button presses.
[7371.56 → 7375.70] Uh, they're using a loophole to bypass app tracking transparency rules.
[7375.70 → 7379.26] Thanks to custom JavaScript code in the in-app browsers.
[7379.26 → 7384.30] It enables a communication bridge between, uh, in-app website content and the host app.
[7384.30 → 7394.06] Meta responded, uh, in quotes, we intentionally developed this code to honour people's, uh, in brackets, asked to track choices on our platforms.
[7394.06 → 7401.74] The code allows us to aggregate user data before using it for targeted, uh, advertising and measurement purposes.
[7401.74 → 7404.10] We do not add any pixels.
[7405.56 → 7406.08] Okay.
[7406.52 → 7407.30] Like tracking pixels.
[7407.50 → 7407.92] Oh, right.
[7408.04 → 7409.78] Uh, code is injected.
[7410.62 → 7412.86] I remember they said screenshots earlier.
[7413.00 → 7414.94] So it's like pixels into your skin.
[7415.14 → 7417.48] See random Instagram logos on all your screenshots.
[7417.48 → 7422.38] It's like, um, oh Geez for purchases made through the in-app browser.
[7422.38 → 7427.46] We seek user consent to save payment information for the purposes of autofill.
[7427.56 → 7429.38] This is all just like super whack.
[7429.52 → 7432.08] Don't, don't use in-app browsers as much as you can avoid it.
[7432.32 → 7435.54] Um, and I don't even just mean for this just in general, it's weird.
[7435.84 → 7436.22] Use the browser.
[7436.22 → 7437.08] They also suck.
[7437.60 → 7437.86] Yeah.
[7437.98 → 7438.58] So there's that.
[7438.64 → 7441.16] They're like, why does LastPass have a browser in it?
[7441.18 → 7441.72] It's dumb.
[7442.06 → 7445.10] Every time it comes up, I'm like, no, of course not.
[7445.10 → 7447.20] I'm trying to find my freaking passwords.
[7447.20 → 7448.20] Why would I, empties?
[7448.24 → 7449.14] Why would I want this?
[7449.26 → 7449.44] Yeah.
[7449.88 → 7453.76] And I understand LastPass thing is like kind of containerized and stuff, but you can do
[7453.76 → 7454.92] that on your own.
[7455.22 → 7455.46] Yeah.
[7456.00 → 7456.32] Anyway.
[7456.64 → 7458.22] Um, yeah.
[7458.24 → 7460.72] And there's like more to it, but I, I don't know.
[7461.22 → 7463.38] Um, it was discovered by Felix Krause.
[7463.46 → 7464.40] Hopefully I said that correctly.
[7464.40 → 7467.36] Thank you very much for finding that and discovering that and sharing it with everyone.
[7467.46 → 7468.86] It is important that people know.
[7469.42 → 7474.42] Um, it's, it's just the reason why I'm being dismissive is not because it's something that
[7474.42 → 7475.32] people should dismiss.
[7475.46 → 7478.00] It's because I'm just super not surprised.
[7478.60 → 7484.02] Um, and I would, I would recommend avoiding honestly, Facebook as much as possible, but,
[7484.46 → 7488.76] um, more specifically just other people's embedded browsers.
[7488.76 → 7489.94] Just, just avoid it.
[7490.04 → 7491.32] If you can screw it.
[7492.04 → 7497.10] Um, many Facebook advertisers were unable to target users on the social network after
[7497.10 → 7502.62] a prompt went live, uh, because it's something to do with, uh, meta trying to claw back what
[7502.62 → 7507.66] they lost when Apple introduced the ask user permission to track users across all apps' thing
[7507.66 → 7508.36] a little while ago.
[7508.48 → 7511.50] Apparently that has actually been super brutal.
[7511.88 → 7516.00] Um, I've done some reading about like how that affected Facebook, and apparently it's been
[7516.00 → 7517.86] like really, really rough.
[7518.22 → 7523.72] Uh, because, and that's one of the reasons what apparently inspired an even bigger push
[7523.72 → 7524.76] into the VR stuff.
[7524.76 → 7527.64] It's because they're like, Oh, we need to own devices.
[7528.20 → 7528.32] Right.
[7528.54 → 7532.32] Um, we can't just work through other people's devices because they can just like wreck our
[7532.32 → 7533.18] company at any time.
[7533.68 → 7539.62] Um, and they want to look past phones because diving into phones now would be like crazy.
[7540.10 → 7543.08] So they decided to push with VR even harder.
[7543.58 → 7545.58] Um, yeah.
[7546.14 → 7547.16] All right.
[7547.96 → 7549.18] Well, that's interesting.
[7549.18 → 7553.88] We've got some, uh, merch messages to get through here and unfortunately, uh, Dan had
[7553.88 → 7554.82] to go deal with something.
[7554.94 → 7555.90] So I guess I'll read them.
[7556.02 → 7560.24] Kevin, your recent videos on losing some data on your servers got me thinking whatever happened
[7560.24 → 7562.80] to the magnetic tape backup that you did a few years back?
[7563.16 → 7571.02] We played around with it and ultimately decided that unless we were going to go for like a proper
[7571.02 → 7576.42] archival tape drive system where there's like a robot that, you know, moves it into the
[7576.42 → 7580.28] thing and copies the thing and then like puts it in a thing, and it's all, it's all, it's
[7580.28 → 7581.00] all automated.
[7581.00 → 7582.60] Like what's on that one.
[7582.60 → 7584.38] And it's, it's stored in a database somewhere.
[7584.38 → 7587.94] So you can recall the right tape when it's time to get it.
[7587.94 → 7593.94] Just without that, it wouldn't really be useful to us.
[7594.28 → 7598.16] What we use the vault for is on the off chance, we're going to need some footage.
[7598.32 → 7600.64] It's nice to be able to grab it and chuck it into a timeline.
[7600.64 → 7607.88] If it was as much work as going and checking some kind of Excel sheet or database, trying
[7607.88 → 7613.74] to find like what a clip, a clip number, like a file name, going, digging that tape
[7613.74 → 7616.68] out, manually inserting it into a thing and copying it off.
[7616.76 → 7618.52] Like it's, it would never happen.
[7618.78 → 7620.20] It would just never happen.
[7620.48 → 7625.22] So what we determined was that we can only afford to keep whatever we can afford to keep
[7625.22 → 7626.04] on spinning rust.
[7626.50 → 7629.48] And even then the vault is not that important.
[7629.48 → 7633.82] The worst case scenario for us is we re-download the footage from YouTube or actually this
[7633.82 → 7637.12] has been, this has saved our bacon a couple of times or from float plane where there's
[7637.12 → 7638.02] a higher quality version.
[7638.12 → 7640.44] In fact, an original, you store original quality for us, right?
[7641.52 → 7641.88] Yeah.
[7642.42 → 7643.26] You don't do you?
[7643.82 → 7644.64] I thought you did.
[7644.82 → 7645.62] I think we still do.
[7645.68 → 7645.88] I don't know.
[7645.92 → 7646.44] It looks pretty good.
[7646.56 → 7646.74] Anyway.
[7646.86 → 7648.20] We used to, I think we still do.
[7648.44 → 7650.92] We've pulled video off float plane before.
[7650.92 → 7659.46] And so because we already have an offsite globally redundant backup of the footage that actually
[7659.46 → 7662.48] made it into videos, the vault is a convenience.
[7663.48 → 7664.82] It's, it's, it's a nice to have.
[7664.90 → 7665.78] It's not a need to have.
[7665.84 → 7667.40] That's why we don't have any redundancy for it.
[7667.40 → 7670.80] It would cost tens of thousands of dollars to have redundancy for the vault.
[7670.84 → 7672.56] And it's just not worth it for us.
[7672.56 → 7679.26] Sorry to bring it back to this topic, but apparently some toxic fans of ours are brigadier
[7679.26 → 7684.88] against the against Naomi Wu.
[7686.04 → 7686.44] Stop.
[7687.04 → 7689.30] Telling them to stop is, I don't know.
[7689.42 → 7691.54] I don't know what the right way to tell you guys to stop is.
[7691.74 → 7692.50] Don't do that.
[7692.56 → 7693.22] That's ridiculous.
[7693.74 → 7694.90] We really don't want you to.
[7695.16 → 7698.12] This isn't like a we're telling you not to, but we actually want you to.
[7698.26 → 7699.88] No, we don't want you to.
[7700.12 → 7700.54] Stop.
[7700.92 → 7701.32] Please.
[7701.32 → 7702.88] You're really not helping anyone.
[7703.16 → 7703.88] This isn't good.
[7704.16 → 7704.88] It's not helpful.
[7705.14 → 7705.90] It's not positive.
[7707.96 → 7709.38] Just stop.
[7709.70 → 7710.06] I don't know.
[7710.26 → 7710.34] Whatever.
[7710.34 → 7713.16] I think we just need to move on because we've said, we've said our piece.
[7713.32 → 7713.46] Yeah.
[7714.28 → 7714.64] Okay.
[7714.68 → 7715.60] I've got another one here for you.
[7715.72 → 7715.98] Nice.
[7716.88 → 7719.06] Thomas from Australia.
[7719.56 → 7720.38] Hello from down under.
[7720.86 → 7723.48] Thoughts on battery technology in houses and when to buy.
[7723.68 → 7723.96] Thanks.
[7726.98 → 7727.34] Hmm.
[7727.86 → 7729.46] You ever thought about putting batteries in your house?
[7729.92 → 7730.08] Yeah.
[7730.08 → 7737.60] So here, the only time a battery would be useful for me would be in the event of a power outage.
[7737.98 → 7740.00] I'd be able to limp along on battery.
[7740.46 → 7752.94] And if we had an extended power outage, like, let's say, let's say our power was out for like days at a time, which in an urban area like I live in, it's like, it snowballs chance in today's climate.
[7752.94 → 7753.86] Sorry.
[7754.82 → 7756.78] Very unlikely, basically.
[7756.78 → 7762.94] Because we have what's called net billing with our local utility monopoly.
[7762.94 → 7780.02] So BC Hydro allows you to buy or sell back any amount of energy continuously depending on whatever the production is of, say, you know, let's say you have like a water turbine or something on your small farm.
[7780.02 → 7783.86] There's like a stream that passes through, and you want to get some power out of it.
[7783.98 → 7786.02] Or if you have solar panels like I do.
[7786.58 → 7792.70] So any additional power, you would just sell back to the grid at the same price.
[7792.70 → 7802.50] One of the big reasons people like batteries in places where they don't have a, oh, yeah, and our power costs the same no matter what time of day because water is always falling, and it's mostly hydropower here in BC.
[7802.96 → 7815.12] So what a lot of people might use batteries for is to store up energy that they might need during a high cost peak, like a peak cost time, like in the afternoon when everyone has their air conditioning on.
[7815.12 → 7820.60] They might use it to store excess energy that they've generated from their solar panels so they can use it at night.
[7820.80 → 7822.78] But I don't have to because of net billing.
[7822.98 → 7826.48] I can essentially use our provincial power grid as a giant battery.
[7826.84 → 7831.52] I can sell any excess anytime I want, and I can buy it back anytime I want.
[7831.58 → 7832.76] And it's always at the same price.
[7833.32 → 7834.76] So it's super cool.
[7839.36 → 7842.74] Yeah, super cool, but it's not useful for me.
[7845.12 → 7845.82] Fair enough.
[7848.06 → 7849.52] Got another one here from Tara.
[7850.34 → 7853.96] If you happen to know, what are the demographics of the LTT audience?
[7854.38 → 7857.54] I can't be the only LTE lady, can I?
[7857.82 → 7858.66] You are not.
[7859.28 → 7860.18] You are not.
[7860.36 → 7861.54] You are in good company.
[7862.20 → 7863.74] There are literally dozens of you.
[7863.92 → 7867.74] I was going to say, it's a proud few, but they do exist.
[7867.84 → 7868.80] I'll bring it up for you guys.
[7868.86 → 7869.52] Here, give me a sec.
[7875.12 → 7876.44] Uh, studio.
[7877.08 → 7877.92] Here we go.
[7879.22 → 7881.30] While you look that up, there's another question.
[7881.62 → 7886.80] Hey, Linus and Luke, I've been feeling very overwhelmed at work lately, as I'm sure you have been as well.
[7886.96 → 7892.40] How do you, if you do, turn off your brain and forget about work when it's time to go home?
[7893.26 → 7894.48] I work from home.
[7895.28 → 7897.66] So, I don't really, to be completely honest.
[7899.20 → 7902.38] But, uh, I've said this before, physical activity is perfect.
[7902.44 → 7902.90] Go for a walk.
[7904.10 → 7904.42] Yeah.
[7904.60 → 7907.38] Going for a walk is, like, way better than I think a lot of people realize.
[7907.44 → 7909.02] Physical health is mental health.
[7909.08 → 7910.06] Your brain is in your body.
[7910.38 → 7914.36] Yeah, and you don't have to, like, you don't have to go lift weights or do anything too crazy.
[7914.76 → 7916.50] Literally, I mean, that's great.
[7916.74 → 7917.30] Do it if you want.
[7917.30 → 7919.68] But, literally, just going for a walk is good.
[7919.88 → 7922.14] Are you ladies, gentlemen, and user-specified ready?
[7922.34 → 7923.66] Because here we go.
[7924.48 → 7926.80] We are three, wow, that's actually higher than before, I think.
[7926.98 → 7935.16] 3.6% identifying as female, 95.3% identifying as male, and 1.2% user-specified.
[7935.68 → 7938.34] As for ages, I guess you guys can't really see that.
[7938.42 → 7940.26] Dan, do you mind just, uh...
[7940.26 → 7940.68] He's on it.
[7940.86 → 7941.46] He's on it.
[7941.76 → 7942.60] Oh, what a guy.
[7942.66 → 7943.20] Oh, my goodness.
[7943.34 → 7943.76] Thanks, Dan.
[7945.04 → 7950.44] We have some minors, bearing in mind, of course, that most of these are probably grouped into
[7950.44 → 7953.64] these next two groups because they lie about their age so they can have access to the full
[7953.64 → 7954.08] platform.
[7954.48 → 7960.18] Then, we, in terms of age, are solid in the 18 to 34 year range, and we start to trail
[7960.18 → 7961.86] off once you get to 35 to 44.
[7962.32 → 7967.70] Apparently, I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm no longer my own core demographic, Luke, as of very soon.
[7967.82 → 7968.30] Oh, no, now.
[7968.42 → 7968.62] Now.
[7968.74 → 7969.14] Yes, now.
[7969.70 → 7973.64] Uh, and then the, the senior crowd is pretty small.
[7973.74 → 7975.34] I'm pretty sure this is my grandma and grandpa.
[7975.34 → 7979.08] Um, and this is probably Luke's parents.
[7979.34 → 7979.50] Yep.
[7979.64 → 7979.92] Yep.
[7979.92 → 7982.62] So, that's about, that's about it.
[7982.68 → 7984.36] Yeah, definitely trails off pretty hard.
[7984.36 → 7985.36] Yeah.
[7988.06 → 7988.54] Yeah.
[7988.62 → 7989.44] 1.2%.
[7989.44 → 7990.10] Let's go.
[7991.42 → 7992.00] Love it.
[7993.74 → 7994.64] What else we got?
[7995.90 → 7996.32] Hmm.
[7996.94 → 8000.48] Uh, Jacob's asking, when is Luke's extreme Intel upgrade?
[8000.48 → 8000.84] Hmm.
[8001.22 → 8002.18] Oh, I'd have to be drawn.
[8002.42 → 8007.26] There's no, like, as far as my understanding goes, there's no, like, it's just a pile and
[8007.26 → 8007.84] we draw names.
[8008.04 → 8013.04] Like, I don't get, my, uh, slip of paper isn't larger than anyone else's slip of paper.
[8013.04 → 8018.80] Um, I also had a non-Intel upgrade, but sort of upgrade thing that wasn't even, like, that
[8018.80 → 8019.30] long ago.
[8019.92 → 8021.30] Um, I'm chilling.
[8021.72 → 8022.44] My stuff's fine.
[8023.78 → 8024.26] Yeah.
[8025.54 → 8027.34] I think this is kind of an interesting one.
[8027.84 → 8032.80] Based on a comment from last week that all major players are in the CPU and GPU markets,
[8033.16 → 8035.66] uh, do you think NVIDIA should branch out into CPUs?
[8037.16 → 8038.10] Well, they tried.
[8038.42 → 8039.80] They tried to buy ARM, remember?
[8040.54 → 8041.62] That was that whole thing.
[8041.62 → 8043.62] But you can't just, like, start making CPUs.
[8044.30 → 8045.06] We've talked about this a bunch.
[8045.14 → 8047.88] Getting into x86 is, like, super complicated.
[8047.98 → 8049.08] Yeah, it's not a thing, basically.
[8049.30 → 8051.06] So you need to buy a company that's in it, basically.
[8051.06 → 8051.24] Yeah.
[8051.36 → 8053.92] So either you buy AMD or you buy Intel.
[8055.16 → 8055.94] Good luck with that.
[8056.00 → 8056.64] Yeah, have fun.
[8056.80 → 8056.98] Yeah.
[8057.84 → 8063.38] I think in the same vein, Oliver's asking, are we going to get the get to see an AMD
[8063.38 → 8065.62] CPU show like we did with the Intel Arc GPUs?
[8066.56 → 8068.66] Uh, would love to see some great Team Red content.
[8068.66 → 8072.00] Um, I mean, they haven't reached out.
[8073.80 → 8076.92] I, uh, bloody hell, where'd it go?
[8077.24 → 8078.68] Did you, uh, archive it already?
[8079.48 → 8079.70] Yes.
[8080.00 → 8080.58] Oh, man.
[8080.76 → 8081.14] I got it.
[8081.68 → 8086.06] I'm not on that team anymore, but I would wager if they wanted to send out technical people,
[8086.06 → 8091.66] uh, that aren't like incredibly PR by the book, and we can dive into some things that it might
[8091.66 → 8092.06] be welcomed.
[8092.20 → 8092.40] Yeah.
[8092.44 → 8096.90] I mean, the big one for me guys is like content is everything.
[8097.02 → 8101.76] When AMD gave us early access to what was it like Vega or something like that?
[8101.76 → 8108.14] We were the first to unbox the Alienware with, uh, with like Vega graphics in it at LTX 2017
[8108.14 → 8109.20] or something like that.
[8109.20 → 8109.38] Yeah.
[8109.70 → 8111.02] We were all over it.
[8111.06 → 8117.92] Like, well, we'll trip over ourselves to, to bring fresh, interesting info and coverage
[8117.92 → 8118.56] to our viewers.
[8118.92 → 8125.26] But if you just want us to do a puff piece where we just like, you know, jerk you off for
[8125.26 → 8128.46] a little while and talk about how great you are, like save yourself the plane ticket.
[8128.46 → 8129.20] We're not going to do it.
[8129.20 → 8129.42] Right.
[8129.50 → 8134.88] Like we got invited down to someone's HQ and I pretty much said like, okay, what are we
[8134.88 → 8135.18] seeing?
[8135.28 → 8140.22] They were like, oh, it's going to be, it's going to be our, our, our lab where we create
[8140.22 → 8141.54] our vision of the future.
[8141.66 → 8144.50] And this was like a Silicon Valley, like tech giant.
[8144.72 → 8146.50] And I'm like, what even is that?
[8146.54 → 8147.98] That doesn't mean anything to me.
[8148.04 → 8150.12] Let someone else do your puff piece.
[8150.30 → 8154.00] Um, if you have anything, if you want to tear down a server, if you want to talk about
[8154.00 → 8157.66] like the nitty-gritty of some, you know, custom AI card that you guys designed.
[8157.66 → 8158.22] Yeah, absolutely.
[8158.34 → 8159.70] I'm in, I'm down.
[8159.98 → 8164.78] Like, even though I don't travel anymore, I've gotten on a plane for IBM.
[8165.10 → 8168.50] I've gotten on a plane to see the fab, uh, to see Intel's fab.
[8168.96 → 8173.08] Uh, I was down for the exclusive hands-on, the early hands-on with Steam Deck.
[8173.16 → 8176.82] Like if it's cool enough, and you got my, you got my attention, I'm going to do it, but
[8176.82 → 8180.92] make it, make it worth my, make it worth my while basically is, is what I'm trying to
[8180.92 → 8181.12] say.
[8181.18 → 8186.26] Not me, make it worth my while in that you've made it worth the while of a million or two
[8186.26 → 8188.68] million people turning their eyeballs at it.
[8192.02 → 8192.38] Okay.
[8192.48 → 8192.92] You want some more?
[8195.24 → 8199.36] Anon's asking, have you guys heard about the Half-Life 2 VR mod that will come out next
[8199.36 → 8199.66] month?
[8199.82 → 8202.16] Are either of you interested at all?
[8202.56 → 8203.66] I haven't even played Alex.
[8204.20 → 8204.52] Uh-oh.
[8204.76 → 8207.28] I'm not a huge Half-Life guy, to be honest with you.
[8207.32 → 8210.86] I know, I know it's like sacrilege in the PC gaming community.
[8210.86 → 8214.50] I'm also not though, which I'm surprised neither of us have gotten flamed harder for
[8214.50 → 8214.70] that.
[8214.80 → 8220.18] But, um, I don't have a room scale area for VR.
[8220.94 → 8222.18] My place is too small.
[8222.46 → 8230.50] So, um, a lot of VR stuff has been, I like to experience it at the office or at Linus's house
[8230.50 → 8231.08] at this point.
[8231.46 → 8233.18] Um, hopefully that will change at some point.
[8233.18 → 8235.92] But, but as of right now, I'm like, I'm seated only.
[8236.32 → 8241.34] So it's not, it's not super cool because the whole seated only experience feels very old
[8241.34 → 8242.00] at this point.
[8242.72 → 8246.92] X War 2 says, to play devil's advocate, this is in Flow plane chat, could someone say you
[8246.92 → 8248.88] puff pieced Intel Arc a few weeks back on when?
[8249.04 → 8249.80] Not my perspective.
[8250.26 → 8251.08] I don't think so.
[8251.14 → 8256.76] I think that we presented a pretty clear story that wasn't just Intel's story.
[8257.10 → 8259.94] We said stuff, but they were like, um.
[8260.04 → 8261.94] We also asked some questions they weren't super happy about.
[8261.94 → 8262.26] Yeah.
[8262.44 → 8263.20] Like, well, I mean, okay.
[8263.24 → 8263.52] They weren't.
[8263.68 → 8263.96] Yeah.
[8264.52 → 8269.80] We did our jobs within the constraints of having a human understanding that, you know,
[8269.80 → 8270.76] there are certain questions.
[8270.76 → 8274.04] Like I could have asked questions that I know they can't answer.
[8274.18 → 8278.20] I could have dug in and, and yelled at them knowing they're not going to answer because
[8278.20 → 8278.96] they're going to get fired.
[8278.96 → 8281.28] Like I, like I understand the dynamics at play.
[8281.36 → 8283.44] So we pushed as hard as we could.
[8283.76 → 8286.10] It's not like you can even buy the thing right now.
[8286.18 → 8290.58] So, you know, oh, well, we didn't show the, the edge cases where it's terrible.
[8290.58 → 8293.92] It's like, yeah, fair enough, but we will, we're going to show it when we review it.
[8294.00 → 8299.28] So by the time it's actually a money decision factor, uh, we'll have given you guys the
[8299.28 → 8299.96] complete story.
[8299.96 → 8301.78] So no, I felt like it was fine.
[8306.58 → 8311.24] Carl is asking, uh, well, he's saying congrats on launching the backpack.
[8311.48 → 8314.92] The radical transparency on sales numbers is kind of fun to watch.
[8314.92 → 8320.46] How terrifying is it to have another 20,000 bags on the way waiting to sell?
[8320.84 → 8322.50] Actually not bad.
[8322.68 → 8330.44] Uh, we settled into what I think might be our, our somewhat sustainable run rate today.
[8330.62 → 8334.14] Today sales before Sancho even, and you guys have been amazing.
[8334.26 → 8336.76] A ton of you were like, warranty, let's go.
[8336.88 → 8337.90] And ordered backpacks.
[8337.96 → 8340.14] I've been watching them come across the screen here the whole time.
[8340.14 → 8345.88] Um, but, uh, even before that today was the first day, uh, cause you usually you'll start
[8345.88 → 8348.44] like this, and you'll see a curve like this, right?
[8348.44 → 8355.28] So we're making our way into that asymptote, uh, portion of our, of our parabolic sales
[8355.28 → 8356.06] curve here.
[8356.70 → 8362.06] Um, today was the first day sales were up compared to the last day, looking like we're, we're kind
[8362.06 → 8362.68] of settling in.
[8362.68 → 8368.36] And based on my numbers, we're actually out ahead of where we would need to be to just
[8368.36 → 8370.00] regularly stock the backpack.
[8370.12 → 8373.86] Cause you guys got to understand wave one's not even going to ship out till September 20th,
[8373.86 → 8374.40] right?
[8374.48 → 8377.92] Wave two isn't going to ship out till three weeks after that.
[8377.96 → 8382.42] And wave three isn't going to ship out until three weeks after that.
[8382.54 → 8389.92] We still have two and a half months to sit and sell wave three before we have a single
[8389.92 → 8392.28] backpack that is actually in stock.
[8392.28 → 8396.74] Now we're maybe not going to move through all wave three in that time, although we
[8396.74 → 8397.10] might.
[8397.72 → 8398.74] Um, but like, yeah, yeah.
[8398.80 → 8399.70] What are those numbers?
[8399.80 → 8403.42] Actually, we might move through wave three in that time, meaning that by the time wave
[8403.42 → 8408.34] four arrives, we'll be in the holiday season when sales are naturally higher.
[8408.90 → 8413.76] And based on if it, if they, but if they settle in a little lower, the math I did was for,
[8413.84 → 8415.58] I think about 50 a day or something like that.
[8415.64 → 8418.58] Our production time and shipping time is about five months.
[8418.58 → 8424.70] So in order to just have stock of it, we need to have like thousands and thousands in the
[8424.70 → 8426.94] warehouse once the end of wave four hits.
[8427.14 → 8428.38] So it's still possible.
[8428.52 → 8432.46] We actually won't have enough and there will be a gap where we don't have stock before we
[8432.46 → 8434.54] can reorder and get more stock.
[8434.62 → 8439.04] It's not like super normal to get to an order page and see the waves that are shipping.
[8439.04 → 8442.86] So eventually it will just turn into a normal product that you can just buy on the store.
[8442.96 → 8446.36] When you buy it, it will chip when the people put it on the truck, and you're good.
[8446.54 → 8448.02] We just felt it was really important.
[8448.12 → 8451.52] This was a Nick initiative and Luke's, uh, Luke's team executed it.
[8451.60 → 8458.84] But, uh, Nick really felt, um, that we wanted to make it, we would rather deter people from
[8458.84 → 8463.76] placing an order by saying, Hey, it's not going to be here for the first day of school.
[8463.76 → 8467.94] Let's make that abundantly clear rather than have people disappointed.
[8467.94 → 8468.24] Right.
[8468.30 → 8471.94] And it'll be the same for, you know, if screwdriver were to launch around the holiday season,
[8471.94 → 8477.76] we'd rather say it won't be here for Christmas than let people think maybe it will.
[8478.24 → 8478.34] Yeah.
[8478.38 → 8479.32] And I'm not to be clear.
[8479.34 → 8480.46] I wasn't bashing that approach.
[8480.46 → 8484.92] I'm just saying it's like, we are currently in that situation, but having some extra backpacks
[8484.92 → 8487.48] doesn't mean like, Oh no, everything's wrecked.
[8487.48 → 8492.48] It means it becomes a normal product instead of this product that has a bunch of waves on it.
[8492.48 → 8495.76] Um, which is, is how stores work.
[8495.92 → 8499.86] So I think we're going to see another wave of orders, not like a wave, like a shipment
[8499.86 → 8503.14] wave, but I think we'll see another rush of orders when it's actually in stock.
[8503.14 → 8508.20] Because right now, anyone who is like splurging, you know, it's not an impulse buy.
[8508.30 → 8509.16] You don't get it for a while.
[8509.20 → 8509.30] Yeah.
[8509.44 → 8509.76] Wait.
[8509.84 → 8514.02] I mean, at this point you have to wait until wave three, which is in like October or something.
[8514.36 → 8515.54] When, when, when's wave three?
[8515.54 → 8516.50] I'm looking it up right now.
[8516.56 → 8517.14] I'm on the store.
[8518.36 → 8519.58] I flipped over to my store.
[8519.66 → 8520.92] I'm like, yeah, trust me, bro.
[8521.00 → 8521.46] Warring t-shirt.
[8521.56 → 8521.86] I love it.
[8521.86 → 8524.00] We actually launched two other shirts today.
[8524.06 → 8525.88] I was just so excited about the trust me, bro.
[8525.96 → 8526.12] One.
[8526.22 → 8527.82] That's October 30th for wave three.
[8528.00 → 8530.14] Uh, components is super nice.
[8530.22 → 8532.30] I absolutely love this one.
[8533.26 → 8534.50] Um, Oh, look at that.
[8534.52 → 8537.02] We've got Yvonne as our, as our model for this one.
[8537.44 → 8538.90] Uh, apparently I'm here too.
[8539.14 → 8541.60] Dennis, uh, this, I love this colour.
[8541.92 → 8543.84] Uh, this is our, what colour is this?
[8543.88 → 8544.24] I don't know.
[8544.40 → 8545.32] It doesn't actually say.
[8545.40 → 8547.50] Apparently we don't have a description for this, but whatever.
[8547.56 → 8548.04] It looks neat.
[8548.04 → 8554.42] And then the other one that launched today is the key switch shirt, which has a review,
[8554.64 → 8558.86] which we will probably have to get rid of because it's probably spam because they don't
[8558.86 → 8559.50] have the shirt yet.
[8559.50 → 8560.38] Because we just launched it.
[8561.38 → 8563.50] Uh, any who.
[8563.50 → 8565.44] Okay.
[8565.52 → 8566.10] Moving on again.
[8566.90 → 8567.26] Joshua.
[8567.94 → 8570.40] Love the backpack and all the work you put into LMG.
[8570.60 → 8574.86] Something I wanted to ask both of you is, do you ever deal with imposter syndrome, imposter
[8574.86 → 8575.80] syndrome on YouTube?
[8575.80 → 8578.90] And if so, how'd you manage to get past it and reach the heights you have?
[8579.42 → 8581.92] I think everyone deals with imposter syndrome a little bit.
[8582.74 → 8584.98] You know, do I, do I deserve this?
[8584.98 → 8593.78] Uh, you know, I think, I think, uh, oh man, Richard, Richard Smalley, Richard Smalley, SNL.
[8594.10 → 8594.58] No.
[8594.88 → 8595.48] Oh man.
[8595.88 → 8597.66] Uh, man.
[8598.98 → 8599.50] SNL.
[8599.60 → 8600.86] Was it a Mike Myers bit?
[8602.36 → 8603.26] Molly SNL.
[8603.34 → 8603.68] Dang it.
[8604.72 → 8605.26] No, no.
[8605.34 → 8605.78] It's someone else.
[8606.20 → 8606.62] Stuart Smalley.
[8606.72 → 8609.32] Stuart Smalley, uh, performed by Al Frankel.
[8610.08 → 8614.96] Um, man, my memory was clearly way off there, but he basically has this character.
[8614.96 → 8617.34] It's a catchphrase where he says, uh, I'm good enough.
[8617.52 → 8618.40] I'm smart enough.
[8618.52 → 8619.36] And gosh darn it.
[8619.40 → 8620.04] People like me.
[8620.12 → 8625.96] Actually, in, in all seriousness though, uh, comedy aside, the, the importance of positive
[8625.96 → 8630.04] self-talk cannot be overstated.
[8630.36 → 8632.54] It's super, super important.
[8633.00 → 8634.34] Oh, apparently the echo's back.
[8634.42 → 8635.00] Yeah, he's on it.
[8635.44 → 8635.80] Okay.
[8636.60 → 8638.54] Uh, if you say something, does it go away?
[8638.56 → 8638.76] Maybe.
[8638.76 → 8639.62] Because that was one of our theories.
[8639.64 → 8641.82] Actually here to troubleshoot it today, which is exciting.
[8642.02 → 8642.42] Nice.
[8642.56 → 8643.16] Nice, Dan.
[8643.30 → 8643.58] Yeah, yeah.
[8643.58 → 8648.30] Um, I think that you have to, I think you have to find a balance.
[8648.36 → 8650.98] I think you have to find a balance that works for your own mental health.
[8651.24 → 8657.70] I, I think that telling yourself that you're just like the king and the greatest and everything
[8657.70 → 8661.96] you do, you absolutely deserve and was all 100% skill.
[8661.96 → 8663.24] I think that's ridiculous, right?
[8663.76 → 8664.44] There's an element.
[8664.44 → 8670.90] I mean, just being, having the, the luck of being born in a place where I was able to
[8670.90 → 8674.48] pursue an entrepreneurial, uh, endeavour, right?
[8674.52 → 8676.02] That's, you can't take that.
[8676.12 → 8677.14] You can't take that for granted.
[8677.34 → 8678.50] Benefit or privilege on its own right.
[8678.94 → 8679.20] Let alone.
[8679.32 → 8684.14] You know, and I mean, there's, there's luck things that are sort of luck and sort of, you
[8684.14 → 8685.94] know, skill in a way.
[8685.94 → 8692.74] Like I was kind of lucky that I just am really into tech and that I was, I was motivated to
[8692.74 → 8695.76] pursue knowledge about it and to help people learn about it.
[8695.76 → 8699.82] Like there's, there's also something to be said about luck where a lot of people will,
[8699.96 → 8703.96] will potentially be in that similar situation, but they don't take it.
[8704.88 → 8709.74] Um, and, and there's risk involved with it and all this other type of stuff.
[8709.78 → 8710.80] It's, it's tough.
[8710.88 → 8716.32] Sometimes you'll work with someone who's just like amazing, and it's like, Oh, can I, can
[8716.32 → 8718.08] I like to stand up to this type of stuff?
[8718.14 → 8720.50] Can I, can I stand beside these people?
[8720.50 → 8728.58] Um, but try to find someone who can give you like real feedback that is both, both positive
[8728.58 → 8732.78] and negative and accept the things that you might not be good at and work on them.
[8732.82 → 8737.88] But just like, don't worry about being necessarily number one in that situation and, uh, do the
[8737.88 → 8739.34] best you can at the things that you are good at.
[8739.48 → 8739.94] I don't know.
[8740.02 → 8740.54] It is what it is.
[8741.44 → 8741.80] Joshua.
[8742.20 → 8744.28] So no, that was the one we just did.
[8745.16 → 8747.04] Ashley says, just wanted to say you guys are awesome.
[8747.14 → 8747.94] Hey, thanks, Ashley.
[8747.98 → 8748.60] You're awesome too.
[8748.60 → 8751.02] Uh, my husband and I love everything we've gotten.
[8751.12 → 8752.88] We look forward to what you guys will do in the future.
[8753.14 → 8755.12] Also has Luke gotten his steam deck?
[8755.20 → 8759.44] Is this going to be, this is going to be a question on land show every freaking week.
[8759.96 → 8760.68] Bell has.
[8761.12 → 8761.48] Really?
[8761.98 → 8762.18] Yeah.
[8762.24 → 8764.06] Well, when did he get his order in before you?
[8764.14 → 8764.58] I would guess.
[8764.66 → 8765.22] It was mine.
[8765.94 → 8766.76] Oh, yeah.
[8767.20 → 8767.78] You do.
[8767.82 → 8769.18] You're not going to have a steam deck.
[8769.28 → 8769.46] Yeah.
[8769.92 → 8770.58] You're out.
[8770.74 → 8771.44] You're done.
[8771.60 → 8772.06] I decided.
[8773.00 → 8776.08] In very, he decided in very stereotypical fashion for me.
[8776.22 → 8776.94] You cheaper out.
[8776.94 → 8779.56] I got to the order screen and was like, that's a lot.
[8785.86 → 8786.26] Yeah.
[8786.56 → 8788.62] I have hands on with the Roneo air now.
[8789.32 → 8791.84] There's cool handhelds coming that are not the steam deck.
[8791.94 → 8798.30] That's the other thing is like, if I did really want it, the order, like wait time from order is getting shorter.
[8798.30 → 8802.36] And there's like an end in sight for having a huge wait time in front of your order.
[8802.52 → 8808.78] And it seems like due to the community's general excitement around it, that they're going to keep developing.
[8808.92 → 8810.80] So if like, if I wanted one in the future, I could get one.
[8811.34 → 8813.02] I didn't like to need it right now.
[8813.02 → 8816.72] And it was like really expensive.
[8816.84 → 8818.44] And I've got other things to save for right now.
[8818.50 → 8822.60] So I was like, this just, I, the amount of times that I would end up using this, like what am I going to do?
[8822.78 → 8824.86] Walk around, do my walks with a steam deck?
[8824.98 → 8825.86] No, probably not.
[8825.86 → 8826.08] It's pretty good for the toilet.
[8828.44 → 8829.10] Just saying.
[8829.38 → 8829.90] Just saying.
[8830.44 → 8833.48] So I'm going to play for like an extremely, yeah, I don't know.
[8833.62 → 8835.28] I just, I don't think I would get enough.
[8835.52 → 8839.94] There's no way I would get enough use out of it to justify the price tag in my opinion.
[8840.14 → 8841.56] And I do think other people would.
[8841.76 → 8842.54] So like, whatever.
[8842.80 → 8848.10] You're so, I don't think I'm so GD cheap because I wouldn't buy like a thousand dollar device.
[8848.44 → 8849.24] Come on.
[8851.08 → 8854.92] I would have, if I was in like the first wave, I would have done it.
[8856.52 → 8860.04] But yeah, it was so late.
[8860.04 → 8862.08] Like, it's not, it's not exactly like I'm one of the first people.
[8862.18 → 8864.24] I'm not even really like an early adopter anymore.
[8864.24 → 8866.88] Like I, it, it, yeah, I don't know.
[8867.00 → 8871.26] I just, I wasn't nearly as interested because the early adopter flare was effectively gone
[8871.26 → 8873.00] and it was super expensive.
[8873.24 → 8876.14] There are other things for me to save for that I'm like actively saving for.
[8876.26 → 8878.80] So whatever, just move it on.
[8878.94 → 8879.48] That's fair.
[8879.76 → 8880.46] That's fair.
[8881.42 → 8886.60] Uh, Dan, I don't know if you saw this, but Tim Sent said, is it the USB audio encoder
[8886.60 → 8887.14] you're using?
[8887.14 → 8891.20] There used to be one with a memory leak that would break on podcasts after an hour.
[8891.44 → 8893.02] Unplugging and rep lugging the DAC fixed it.
[8893.02 → 8894.62] Leo Lahore and CNET used to have it.
[8895.82 → 8897.78] I don't believe so.
[8898.94 → 8900.26] Uh, let me check memory.
[8901.24 → 8902.54] Steam decks cost money.
[8902.76 → 8903.86] Not on my watch.
[8903.96 → 8904.60] Luke probably.
[8905.28 → 8906.22] Fern 182.
[8908.66 → 8909.14] Memory.
[8909.14 → 8916.88] And Races says, no, you're goddamn cheap because you won't even buy new shoes.
[8917.22 → 8918.34] Has nothing to do with Steam Deck.
[8918.48 → 8918.62] Okay.
[8918.78 → 8920.68] But that's not, that's a different thing.
[8921.16 → 8921.98] Come on.
[8922.08 → 8922.36] Okay.
[8922.48 → 8926.66] So the shoes thing is because if I, I, I thought, okay, when we talked about the shoes' thing,
[8926.66 → 8928.42] I told, I said the bounty too.
[8928.48 → 8929.38] And just everyone ignored it.
[8929.38 → 8935.34] I put up a bounty for this exact pair of shoes for like over four times the original cost.
[8935.74 → 8939.34] And I was, you know, in like, you know, sneaker heads, Ooh, four times original cost.
[8939.44 → 8940.36] Ooh, big spender.
[8940.74 → 8944.46] But these aren't, I know, but these aren't like fancy shoes that anyone cares about.
[8944.46 → 8948.40] So I was, I was really hoping to be able to find them because these aren't, these aren't
[8948.40 → 8949.14] like collectible.
[8949.26 → 8952.30] No one cares at all, but yeah, I could never find them.
[8952.42 → 8958.04] I've tried on quite a few other shoes and I just, they don't fit me the same way.
[8958.04 → 8961.40] Like I, I was doing a technical thing.
[8961.46 → 8964.40] I'm not going to get way into it, but it was, it was a technical walk thing the other day.
[8964.82 → 8968.60] And I was like thinking in my head, like, wow.
[8968.68 → 8968.90] Yeah.
[8969.48 → 8971.14] These shoes are still great.
[8971.14 → 8973.70] And I really wish I could just have more pairs of them.
[8973.70 → 8978.72] My mistake there in, in being cheap was like a week after I got them.
[8978.72 → 8980.06] And I was like, wow, these are perfect.
[8980.18 → 8982.24] I should have gone and bought like a ton.
[8982.76 → 8986.74] I should have gone and bought like at least five just so that I would have them moving
[8986.74 → 8987.18] forward.
[8987.36 → 8988.56] That's what I screwed up.
[8991.84 → 8993.30] Luke is the watermelon returner.
[8993.36 → 8994.24] I'm not.
[8994.94 → 8996.16] Leave me alone.
[8996.94 → 8998.48] Um, all right.
[8998.50 → 8999.34] We've got a couple more.
[8999.72 → 9002.32] Are you still diagnosing Dan or do you want to hit us with this?
[9002.32 → 9005.52] I have absolutely no, what, what idea the issue could be.
[9005.58 → 9006.34] It's driving me nuts.
[9006.66 → 9007.28] Keeps me up at night.
[9007.28 → 9009.92] Uh, I can't pronounce this.
[9010.30 → 9011.50] Says audio dude here.
[9011.62 → 9012.36] It's instant.
[9012.48 → 9016.76] So sounds like the activation of another mic farther away in the room than Linus and Luke.
[9016.86 → 9017.82] So not an echo.
[9018.00 → 9019.82] And we do have two other mics here.
[9019.82 → 9021.24] I don't have inputs for either of them.
[9021.32 → 9021.86] You do not have.
[9021.86 → 9022.66] Mine was muted.
[9022.94 → 9027.78] There are no other extraneous resources, no other microphones, no other anything.
[9027.96 → 9029.48] The signal chain is really nice and clean.
[9029.90 → 9035.32] Uh, one thing that I think it might be is active, uh, the one of the noise cancelling,
[9035.32 → 9036.34] uh, plugins.
[9036.34 → 9038.52] Because I disabled that and then it came back.
[9038.52 → 9039.98] So I'll have to experiment with that.
[9040.36 → 9040.70] All right.
[9040.92 → 9043.02] I see, I see four devices.
[9043.94 → 9044.30] Yeah.
[9044.30 → 9044.88] They're all muted.
[9045.00 → 9045.86] So they're not coming.
[9045.86 → 9048.38] No, there's four unmuted devices right now.
[9049.48 → 9050.84] Bleep sound is the one.
[9051.16 → 9052.10] Oh, bleep sound is one of them.
[9052.10 → 9052.68] Got it.
[9052.76 → 9052.96] Yeah.
[9052.96 → 9054.02] So it's, it's my mind.
[9055.40 → 9055.94] Got it.
[9056.02 → 9056.26] Okay.
[9056.86 → 9057.04] Yeah.
[9059.02 → 9059.92] It's maddening.
[9060.04 → 9060.88] It's maddening.
[9062.16 → 9062.68] All right.
[9062.70 → 9063.24] Hit us again.
[9063.24 → 9065.24] Uh, oh yeah.
[9065.40 → 9068.06] Uh, Licks Wolf is asking, hi Linus and Luke.
[9068.18 → 9071.18] Do either of you use windows virtual desktops at all?
[9071.54 → 9075.92] Uh, I always feel it's an underused workflow feature on Windows as opposed to Linux.
[9077.52 → 9079.86] I tried it for a while.
[9080.74 → 9082.28] It's been a long time.
[9082.48 → 9085.96] So my feedback wouldn't be accurate if I tried to give it now.
[9085.96 → 9092.46] Um, but I did not find like it was as good as the Linux one was.
[9092.46 → 9093.92] I don't remember why.
[9094.18 → 9095.32] And I know that's not very helpful.
[9095.82 → 9098.30] Um, but I, I did actively use the Linux one.
[9098.56 → 9100.68] I tried with the windows one and I stopped.
[9101.94 → 9102.94] Uh, Oh, Aries.
[9103.02 → 9105.06] I accidentally, um, archived this one.
[9105.18 → 9107.48] Have you checked out game stream and remote desktop on the steam deck?
[9107.92 → 9113.24] Uh, currently using it as a daily driver to stream our VMs with VMware horizon and steam
[9113.24 → 9114.02] stream games.
[9114.30 → 9116.64] Power usage is minimal enabling max battery life.
[9116.70 → 9116.86] Yeah.
[9116.94 → 9118.82] That's a super cool use case for it.
[9118.88 → 9120.92] I'm super into remote game streaming.
[9120.92 → 9125.96] I think we were one of the first ones to really dive into it back in the day when valve first
[9125.96 → 9129.70] launched that feature, and it was run by as far as I could tell one dev.
[9130.28 → 9134.06] Um, and yeah, it's a super, super smart way to optimize your battery life.
[9134.12 → 9137.94] And the screen is so small that the kinds of compression artifacts that you're dealing
[9137.94 → 9143.92] with at the bit rates that we can now encode nearly instantaneously to, I's, it's minimal.
[9144.16 → 9145.16] It's freaking awesome.
[9145.16 → 9150.36] Like if you're trying to run 60 megabits on a giant 4k TV or something like that, you're
[9150.36 → 9153.98] game streaming like that, you're going to see a lot of compression, but on a tiny little
[9153.98 → 9155.78] display like that, man, it looks perfect.
[9156.62 → 9157.32] Perfect.
[9157.96 → 9158.06] Yeah.
[9160.72 → 9164.00] Oh, anonymous with the Cathar Storm G5.
[9164.00 → 9168.42] I will give you, it's the silver one.
[9172.68 → 9173.16] Hmm.
[9174.62 → 9175.86] I'll give you a grand.
[9176.84 → 9177.10] What?
[9177.22 → 9177.34] Sorry.
[9177.42 → 9177.90] What is this?
[9178.30 → 9185.68] It's like the it's a piece of water cooling history that no one but me probably cares about.
[9185.94 → 9186.74] Oh, okay.
[9186.74 → 9189.74] That's a really, it's a good price.
[9189.82 → 9190.68] It was a good investment.
[9192.84 → 9194.70] So there, that's my, that's my offer.
[9195.24 → 9200.68] You can get in touch via the publicly available email on the channel, but that's, that's all
[9200.68 → 9201.44] I have to say about that.
[9201.52 → 9202.24] Okay, Dan, hit me.
[9203.68 → 9205.60] James is asking, challenging situation.
[9205.94 → 9207.24] Way to end up doing the right thing.
[9207.32 → 9212.40] What is the product category that bearing all expense and reason you would love to tackle?
[9212.76 → 9213.42] Oh my goodness.
[9213.42 → 9214.18] I don't know.
[9215.44 → 9216.14] Would you do cars?
[9216.74 → 9217.92] Oh, heavens no.
[9218.30 → 9218.62] Lamborghini.
[9218.90 → 9219.84] No, heavens no.
[9219.84 → 9220.04] Remember.
[9220.74 → 9221.02] Okay.
[9221.12 → 9226.08] So I don't think it would change your answer, but remember, barring all expense and reason.
[9226.12 → 9227.66] I don't have a ton of passion for it.
[9227.90 → 9228.36] No, I know.
[9228.54 → 9230.48] Which is why I said, I think the answer stays the same.
[9230.76 → 9231.58] I'm just making sure.
[9232.26 → 9232.36] Yeah.
[9232.36 → 9232.40] Yeah.
[9232.48 → 9234.82] That's, that's the why do I have this hanging off my ear?
[9234.86 → 9236.06] I've had this off the whole time.
[9236.76 → 9238.36] That's, that's the that's the reason.
[9238.42 → 9243.14] I mean, the things that I'm really kind of simple, the things I'm really passionate about,
[9243.14 → 9246.48] I, I, we're kind of doing, making screwdriver.
[9246.76 → 9248.12] We have awesome water bottles.
[9248.52 → 9250.34] What about your own line of motorcycles?
[9251.06 → 9253.66] Um, see, that's the thing though, is what would I contribute?
[9253.78 → 9254.96] I'm not a professional rider.
[9255.56 → 9256.62] I like it.
[9256.62 → 9257.54] You build it for you.
[9257.70 → 9257.98] Yeah.
[9257.98 → 9262.20] But I don't think that, no, no, we should let the I think that's one of those categories
[9262.20 → 9266.94] where we should really let the professionals and the engineers work together and come up
[9266.94 → 9268.66] with something, and I'm just going to enjoy it.
[9268.90 → 9269.12] Right.
[9269.16 → 9272.60] Like the, the, the most I might change is going to be the aesthetic anyway.
[9272.60 → 9273.98] So I'll get a body kit, right?
[9273.98 → 9277.22] Like I, I can customize my own if I really want to.
[9277.26 → 9279.64] I don't think it needs to be a mass, mass market product.
[9280.02 → 9281.10] Audio equipment that doesn't echo.
[9281.44 → 9281.78] Hmm.
[9282.96 → 9283.40] Hmm.
[9283.66 → 9284.02] Yes.
[9284.02 → 9285.40] Mine would be games.
[9286.04 → 9287.06] Losing my mind.
[9287.52 → 9287.92] Uh, okay.
[9288.00 → 9288.16] Sorry.
[9288.46 → 9288.96] I think you can.
[9289.76 → 9290.48] We've got another one.
[9290.84 → 9291.24] The doctor.
[9292.02 → 9295.92] Hey Linus, you showed the Steam Deck fitting into the LTD backpack without the case, but
[9295.92 → 9299.14] will it fit with the Steam Deck case or the D brand kill switch cover?
[9299.94 → 9301.16] Uh, one moment, please.
[9302.40 → 9303.96] Uh, Luke, you're handling the next one, I guess.
[9304.04 → 9304.40] Okay.
[9304.68 → 9306.90] Uh, it's a question for you specifically.
[9307.68 → 9308.08] Nice.
[9308.80 → 9309.28] Um.
[9309.98 → 9310.74] Well, do your best.
[9312.38 → 9312.78] Okay.
[9312.84 → 9313.82] So it says, hey Linus,
[9313.82 → 9320.24] trying to avoid cat cables running around in a house I am renting a room at, but need
[9320.24 → 9324.56] 600 to 700 megabits per second speed for my PC.
[9324.74 → 9327.08] Do you suggest Ethernet over power or mesh network?
[9327.50 → 9330.24] Oh, personally, neither.
[9330.82 → 9333.06] Um, I would just figure it out.
[9333.44 → 9334.82] Road network cables.
[9335.22 → 9335.38] Yeah.
[9335.88 → 9337.92] Um, just find a way to do it nicely.
[9337.92 → 9338.20] You couldn't answer that for me.
[9338.54 → 9338.98] I did.
[9339.50 → 9341.00] No, I just mean you could have just said.
[9341.20 → 9341.82] Oh, I hadn't.
[9341.82 → 9342.70] I hadn't read the whole thing.
[9342.76 → 9344.18] This will be Linus's answer.
[9344.30 → 9344.48] Yeah.
[9344.56 → 9344.70] Yeah.
[9344.70 → 9344.84] Yeah.
[9344.84 → 9347.78] I think you and I both know each other's position on that pretty well.
[9347.78 → 9353.18] And have, uh, given examples to each other of it multiple times.
[9353.58 → 9355.80] Um, but yeah, just find, just find a way to run it.
[9355.90 → 9357.38] That isn't super bad.
[9358.42 → 9359.36] Cable manage it nicely.
[9359.60 → 9359.98] There are ways.
[9360.40 → 9360.88] And there are ways.
[9360.98 → 9362.24] I understand you included.
[9362.38 → 9363.88] I'm renting a room in this house.
[9364.30 → 9367.08] Um, there are ways to do it non-destructively for sure.
[9367.08 → 9370.34] Um, but yeah, just, just run the cable.
[9370.52 → 9372.46] You're not, you're not going to be happy with either of the other solutions.
[9372.64 → 9374.12] There is also power line.
[9374.30 → 9375.76] You're not going to get 600, 700.
[9376.22 → 9381.48] He suggests, uh, Ethernet over power or mesh network, but he's saying six to 700.
[9381.92 → 9382.66] Ethernet over power.
[9382.74 → 9383.84] I switched it around in my mind.
[9383.88 → 9384.76] I went power over Ethernet.
[9384.78 → 9385.86] That's how I usually say it as well.
[9385.98 → 9386.52] I've just said.
[9386.64 → 9386.94] Well, no, no.
[9386.96 → 9387.94] POE is a different thing.
[9388.24 → 9389.38] Oh, that's right.
[9389.46 → 9389.66] Yeah.
[9389.66 → 9389.84] Yeah.
[9389.92 → 9390.20] Right.
[9390.26 → 9391.36] So I was thinking.
[9391.56 → 9392.92] Well, I just call it power line.
[9394.14 → 9394.50] Yes.
[9394.74 → 9395.14] But whatever.
[9395.14 → 9398.66] Um, those speeds are very specific.
[9399.18 → 9399.54] Yes.
[9399.60 → 9400.96] I'm like, what could he need that for?
[9402.12 → 9405.64] So I'm assuming it's something that's like relatively important, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[9405.64 → 9405.82] blah.
[9405.92 → 9409.94] And at that point, like, I don't really want to, the fluctuations that are involved with
[9409.94 → 9412.80] both of those solutions are just, just, just, just run a cable.
[9412.88 → 9413.44] Run the cable.
[9413.72 → 9414.88] It's, it's worth it.
[9415.22 → 9415.44] Yeah.
[9417.18 → 9418.82] Um, oh, right.
[9420.16 → 9421.26] So here it is.
[9421.76 → 9422.66] Don't worry about it, Dan.
[9423.40 → 9424.10] Oh, never mind.
[9424.10 → 9425.52] He wasn't going to spring into action anyway.
[9426.18 → 9431.34] So the idea here was that we've got one of those like soft.
[9432.04 → 9432.48] Oh, whoops.
[9432.54 → 9432.68] Sorry.
[9432.78 → 9433.44] In the main pocket.
[9433.62 → 9433.74] All right.
[9433.78 → 9435.76] The laptop pocket, not the main pocket.
[9435.98 → 9439.18] We've got one of those soft facing things here in the bottom.
[9439.72 → 9440.12] Okay.
[9440.24 → 9440.74] Right here.
[9440.94 → 9443.10] So the idea was you could put your steam deck in unsheathed.
[9443.10 → 9451.24] You can also put it in, in the case, but note that that will, if you have a laptop as well.
[9451.24 → 9452.74] Oh, he is springing into action.
[9453.42 → 9453.70] Okay.
[9453.82 → 9455.90] If you have a laptop in there as well, which I do.
[9456.34 → 9456.80] Okay.
[9456.80 → 9458.80] It's, it's pretty tight.
[9459.16 → 9468.30] So when you close it, like, yeah, it works fine, but that's pretty, uh, that's pretty tight.
[9468.30 → 9468.74] Okay.
[9468.74 → 9475.24] So like it doesn't interfere with the main pouch of holding or anything like that.
[9475.38 → 9475.86] Oh my goodness.
[9475.86 → 9478.94] This is really hard to do, but it does bulge a little bit at the bottom.
[9478.94 → 9480.50] I mean, you can't break the laws of physics.
[9480.50 → 9482.68] It takes up as much space as it takes up.
[9482.68 → 9486.78] Uh, what I would typically do just because you have to kind of unzip it.
[9486.86 → 9487.70] So, well, I don't know.
[9488.00 → 9490.44] It's also got the little handle on it actually comes out pretty easily.
[9490.88 → 9491.14] Okay.
[9491.18 → 9491.74] It kind of works.
[9492.06 → 9497.92] It wasn't what we had in mind, but because it's just the right width already, it's fine.
[9497.98 → 9502.40] I guess what I would probably do with it is throw it in the main compartment just because
[9502.40 → 9504.98] like, yeah, this is so bulky.
[9504.98 → 9509.38] Anything that's going to be that big should go into the area of holding.
[9509.52 → 9511.30] And it's got a protective cover on it anyway.
[9511.30 → 9514.40] So it's not like you have to worry about it banging on things or anything like that.
[9514.62 → 9514.70] Yeah.
[9515.76 → 9516.18] Oh no.
[9516.28 → 9518.20] Matt asks, what's the latest with my home smart switches?
[9518.34 → 9520.06] Well, half of them are no longer visible.
[9520.74 → 9524.96] Um, I don't know if that's home assistants fault or their switches fault.
[9525.64 → 9527.88] Uh, so I can't change any of the parameters.
[9528.80 → 9532.64] Um, I, I, I don't know.
[9532.64 → 9538.00] Maybe I'll email back the Novel CEO and be like, yeah, we need to do the line of switch.
[9538.20 → 9539.48] I'll, I'll, I'll promote it.
[9539.52 → 9539.92] I'll fund it.
[9539.96 → 9540.38] I don't care.
[9540.38 → 9545.42] I just want to get rid of these things, but, but it might not be their fault.
[9545.50 → 9549.02] I have more diagnosis to do and be like, we're not even, we don't even have a lot of boxes
[9549.02 → 9549.62] unpacked.
[9549.70 → 9554.66] So diagnosing smart switch things is just lower on my list of priorities.
[9554.66 → 9557.42] Although we did do RGB in the gaming room today.
[9557.84 → 9559.16] Ooh, there's a lot.
[9559.50 → 9561.50] An RGB vendor sponsored the video.
[9561.64 → 9562.16] Oh boy.
[9562.28 → 9566.12] So it's like, oh Geez.
[9566.12 → 9568.88] I think that's it.
[9569.28 → 9569.92] Is that it?
[9570.08 → 9570.70] I think that's it.
[9571.18 → 9572.76] Oh, there's another one.
[9575.36 → 9579.26] Uh, hey, thanks Samuel.
[9581.00 → 9585.58] Message me on the OG forums about extending the silver tech tips limited shirt time.
[9585.58 → 9587.82] You responded back with, I will talk to Nick from then on.
[9587.88 → 9588.86] I knew I could trust you, bro.
[9588.98 → 9589.68] Thanks for being real.
[9589.72 → 9590.00] Always.
[9590.06 → 9590.70] I do my best.
[9591.22 → 9592.42] Sometimes I screw it up.
[9593.94 → 9595.64] Sometimes I screw it up.
[9595.90 → 9596.44] Things happen.
[9597.00 → 9597.46] But darn it.
[9597.48 → 9597.86] I try.
[9597.98 → 9598.48] Thanks Samuel.
[9600.90 → 9601.26] Okay.
[9601.66 → 9604.04] And I'm going to try to end this show.
[9604.04 → 9607.28] Thank you for tuning in.
[9607.60 → 9608.56] We'll see you again next week.
[9608.72 → 9609.52] Same bad time.
[9609.62 → 9611.96] Same bad channel with no controversy.
[9612.68 → 9613.94] And you can trust him on that, bro.
[9614.76 → 9615.20] Bye.
[9618.70 → 9619.44] Trust me, bro.
[9619.52 → 9619.92] Warranty.
[9622.06 → 9622.38] TMB.
[9634.04 → 9643.86] Oh, yeah.
[9643.98 → 9646.78] So brought to you by Sea sonic Vulture and the other one.
[9646.98 → 9647.36] Oh, crap.
[9647.66 → 9648.28] This is awkward.
[9648.72 → 9649.86] They probably won't watch this.
[9650.88 → 9652.38] Well, that's the one.
[9655.20 → 9656.36] Sig Stack Fault.
[9656.66 → 9658.28] Make sure you send another message.
[9658.48 → 9661.86] Because, like, that should never happen on purpose.
[9662.04 → 9663.90] Worst case scenario, tweet it, Nick or me.
[9664.48 → 9664.78] All right.
[9664.96 → 9665.12] Okay.
[9665.34 → 9665.48] Bye.
[9666.02 → 9666.58] Preferably, Nick.
