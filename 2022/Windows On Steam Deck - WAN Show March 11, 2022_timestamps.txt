[2022-03-12T07:06:50Z] Video: Windows On Steam Deck - WAN Show March 11, 2022 
Sometimes I'll start watching early into the stream, and then finish watching 5 hours later. Having to refresh so that the video time shows up properly (and is kept track of properly) is important, but it can be difficult to find where I left off (especially if the "remaining video length" shown isn't accurate so it can't be math'd out). That is to sayâ€”thank you Linus, for your very expressive hand gestures. Every gesture is so unique that it makes finding the right timestamp so much easier (without needing to listen to half the show again).
