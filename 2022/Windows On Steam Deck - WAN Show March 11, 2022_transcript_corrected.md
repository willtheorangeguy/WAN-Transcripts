[0.00 → 1.52] okay I've resumed the selected
[4.40 → 8.96] welcome to the wan show hey we've got a great show for you guys today ladies and gentlemen
[8.96 → 14.24] that's right this is an episode of a podcast that will not get pulled down by big tech
[15.28 → 20.64] I thought you weren't going to bring it up because it will not have any misinformation in it well it
[20.64 → 25.04] might have misinformation and I can't guarantee that yeah lots of great topics this week guys
[25.04 → 31.12] apple's peak performance event product announcements were many and actually exciting
[31.84 → 40.00] uh artesian builds who generated significant controversy last week has formally completely
[40.00 → 45.52] pooped all over itself and the bed and the floor so we're going to get through that what else we got
[45.52 → 51.28] today we got windows on a steam deck what maybe windows on a steam deck yeah well where what do
[51.28 → 59.52] you look through to see a door a wheel well what one has more doors or wheels okay
[59.52 → 66.80] who knows also lime wire is back what whoa your had fiddle dee being a pirate is
[69.92 → 78.80] except this time it's worse
[81.28 → 93.84] the show is brought to you by jump cloud vulture and dream host now this is not fair the Ryan the
[93.84 → 100.88] Ryan asks in float plane chat is it a great show if every show is a great show yes, yes yeah because
[100.88 → 107.04] it's relative to I don't know what it's relative to i was going to say other shows but I don't know
[107.04 → 115.52] that other shows are probably better let's jump right into our big topic which is windows on steam
[115.52 → 121.60] deck now I was actually expecting to get windows support for the steam deck before we did our
[121.60 → 128.96] initial hardware review right so that was way back like over a month ago I was expecting Windows drivers
[128.96 → 136.40] and valve kept saying oh we have them, but we can't send them something legal review
[136.40 → 141.52] something something something okay sorry we can't give them to you but apparently there
[141.52 → 147.60] were working drivers which makes sense because while there was obviously a lot of work to be done by
[147.60 → 152.64] AMD and valve software teams particularly I would think AMD for something like a closed source windows
[152.64 → 160.64] driver I mean these were mostly known quantities right there's n3 cores, and they're
[160.64 → 168.80] bolted to a rdna2 onboard graphics chip rather than um a Vega based graphics chip but fundamentally that
[168.80 → 173.84] architecture exists already so they're not starting from scratch right like they're there's a
[173.84 → 181.28] starting point that they have to work from um so i was expecting it to be pretty mature and
[181.28 → 188.00] pretty fleshed out and I was expecting it to come before our hardware review where we looked at uh we looked at
[188.00 → 195.52] thermals uh we looked at uh performance we looked at acoustics and pretty much ran all the way
[195.52 → 202.16] through the deck, and you know major kudos to valve they did a great job of transparency and allowing us
[202.16 → 207.84] to really fully test it even though we were limited in terms of game selection just because the software
[207.84 → 212.96] really wasn't ready yet, and they knew that and that was fine, but they told us that the windows
[212.96 → 218.08] drivers were going to come like I didn't I didn't just pull that out of thin air oh well I am expecting
[218.08 → 222.48] Windows drivers because I am a Windows user it wasn't like that they told us they were going to
[222.48 → 229.12] come give me what I want then in between the hardware review so we had the lead up to the hardware
[229.12 → 234.00] review so then we published the hardware review and then in between the publishing of the hardware review
[234.56 → 241.36] and the release of our software review I was expecting Windows drivers again and when i shot the
[241.36 → 248.64] software review it was actually the morning of my family's ski trip to um right I don't know what it's
[248.64 → 253.68] called anymore, but it used to be called hemlock mountain, and we were going there and basically i
[253.68 → 260.96] had to shoot it then because I kept putting off and putting off and putting off starting the software
[260.96 → 269.12] review because valve kept sending just they kept inundating me with software updates and I was still
[269.12 → 276.16] expecting a Windows driver so I went and I did like I played on it, I used it i I did spend a lot of time
[276.16 → 282.16] with it and i I wrote down a lot of thoughts I threw a lot of things at the page but I couldn't write the
[282.16 → 288.96] video because I couldn't tell the whole story because I hadn't like if they were going to drop a windows
[288.96 → 297.36] driver on me two days before publication I was going to have like a big section comparing Linux to
[297.36 → 303.04] windows performance for example like if I'm is I'm supposed to say this is the software review
[303.04 → 309.36] i it changes the angle of the video right yeah what I'm going to cover in it so I ended up staying
[309.36 → 317.12] up until 7 30 in the morning and then I only slept for about two hours and then I went I met a camera
[317.12 → 321.28] crew at like the new house because that's where they were set up doing some sponsored thing for Telus
[321.28 → 328.48] already anyway shot the roll and then drove to the mountain afterward because I had to leave it to
[328.48 → 335.36] the very last second, so again there was a period of time when I was expecting Windows drivers well they
[335.36 → 342.48] finally arrived this week like yesterday, and naturally we dropped absolutely everything and
[342.48 → 347.04] immediately set to work testing them and I got to tell you guys are going to want to watch the full
[347.04 → 353.20] video because the exact numbers matter and i I don't remember everything off the top of my head but
[353.20 → 359.52] Anthony and I had a perfect meeting about sort of what we want the scope of this video to be because
[360.16 → 365.92] i I don't think that okay in the state they're in
[365.92 → 378.80] I don't want to invest too much time investigating the performance differences between the in between
[378.80 → 387.36] the nvidia between the Linux and the Windows drivers oh my okay yeah so uh we had a really
[387.36 → 395.12] good chat about what we want the scope of the video to be and man did we ever find a ton of interesting
[395.12 → 403.04] stuff going on almost immediately um and then also we had a really we sat down we did a full script
[403.04 → 407.92] review we almost never get to like to sit down and talk to Anthony about stuff anymore because he hosts
[407.92 → 413.04] so many of the videos that he writes now instead of me editing and me hosting them so it was actually
[413.04 → 418.96] really nice to say because we often will just chat about stuff and I feel like we end up with
[419.52 → 424.08] regardless of whether it's me who reviews it I think we end up with a better script a better video
[424.08 → 429.04] if a second pair of eyes looks at it and starts to you know ask those questions right that someone
[429.76 → 433.44] sometimes you just you got your nose buried in it for too long there are certain questions that you've
[433.44 → 437.68] had answered for so long but you don't really think about it or you take something for granted one of
[437.68 → 442.72] our new writers came in uh talking to me about a video that we were doing about whether it matters if
[442.72 → 448.88] your GPU is still getting drivers so we took drivers that have been unsupported for in some cases
[448.88 → 456.72] years yeah and tried to run very new games on them to see well just how far does direct x get you
[456.72 → 462.00] you know can you just limp along and probably have compatibility or do you need a game ready driver
[462.00 → 470.16] right and fascinating findings, but we went into this whole explanation without having any kind of
[470.16 → 475.84] paragraph outlining like a pepper what is direct x yeah or something like that I can't remember if it was
[475.84 → 480.88] exactly that, but we were missing some key piece of information like hey you actually can't
[480.88 → 486.80] take that for granted this could be something that you know uh some young kid just getting into pc gaming
[486.80 → 491.84] watches, and we need to give them at least okay it might be a little jargon, but we need to give them at
[491.84 → 498.96] least a basic explanation of what purpose this serves before we can move past it so anyway I sat down
[498.96 → 507.92] with Anthony and we talked through it and boy is it ever a mixed bag so first up good guy valve
[508.80 → 513.76] providing Windows drivers sure yeah they could have just as easily not done it in fact it would have
[513.76 → 521.44] been a lot less work for them and AMD because you got to remember even though these are zen 3 CPU cores
[521.44 → 532.80] cores and rdna2 based GPU cores they are bolted together glued in a custom SOC this is a
[532.80 → 540.80] custom chip, so there is absolutely extra work that needed to be done compounding matters is that aside
[540.80 → 548.16] from being a custom chip it has at least in the pc space from my experience a pretty unique
[548.16 → 558.00] um system architecture it doesn't have main system memory and GPU memory right which is normal for an
[558.00 → 566.24] integrated GPU but with an integrated GPU at this kind of performance level were there unique challenges
[567.28 → 574.48] presumably these are challenges AMD is probably going to have to face as they move into uh their upcoming uh
[574.48 → 581.60] rdna2 base dig uh like Apus yes, but definitely they could have saved themselves some work and they
[581.60 → 590.00] could have kicked some work down the road but absolutely also as soon as valve provides a driver
[590.00 → 598.24] they will start receiving support tickets and even if every message they get about running windows
[598.24 → 604.40] on the steam deck they just send back a canned response that says we don't support windows on the
[604.40 → 612.64] steam deck which is their formal stance right they have provided these drivers, but it is not a supported
[613.20 → 622.96] use case it is still creating extra busy work for valve corporation oh for sure absolutely and from our
[622.96 → 631.84] experience with it is could create more support tickets than less so there are a few things to keep
[631.84 → 639.60] in mind one is that not all drivers are available first and foremost the Wi-Fi drivers are not baked into
[639.60 → 646.64] windows actually no first and foremost you will not be running the latest version of windows support for
[646.64 → 654.32] the TPM so the trusted platform module that is required for Windows 11 is not baked into the
[654.32 → 661.44] firmware yet I do not want Windows 11 anyway so you cannot well remember this is a touch screen device
[661.44 → 668.48] Windows 11 has a lot of improvements for touch screen devices that's fair yeah so you might want windows
[668.48 → 673.76] 11 whether you are correct or not um that's a whole separate conversation that we're not going to get into
[673.76 → 678.08] today but so first and foremost you can't install the latest version of windows so you are stuck with
[678.08 → 684.56] Windows 10 for better or for worse second of all when you install windows you're going to have to go get
[684.56 → 692.08] some kind of network adapter or something because I don't know if you've had this experience but
[692.08 → 700.16] Windows installers recently have stopped allowing you to go to proceed past the setup phase unless you have
[700.16 → 705.60] an internet connection and unless you sign in to a Microsoft account there are workarounds to be
[705.60 → 712.08] clear yeah but for most people like for the is a console that's the way we have to be fair I don't
[712.08 → 715.76] think if you're looking at it from the perspective of a console gamer I don't think they're going to
[715.76 → 720.88] install windows that's too much of an advanced move unless there's a game they like really want to
[720.88 → 727.52] play, and they find a super basic tutorial to get them through it, they might if it's a super basic tutorial
[727.52 → 731.84] it would probably include this portion though it might include it, but you might have to go out and
[731.84 → 736.64] buy one yeah unless you already have a type c to Ethernet adapter for your switch for example or
[736.64 → 742.00] something like that so you may have to go out and get some other network adapter because the onboard
[742.00 → 748.00] Wi-Fi module is doing not have support baked into windows yeah so you'll need a network connection in
[748.00 → 753.92] order to get a network connection I'm so surprised this networking device did not have support baked into
[753.92 → 760.08] windows I know right okay once you're in windows you can install Wi-Fi drivers Bluetooth works which
[760.08 → 766.56] is great valve does not have an audio driver yet for the onboard speakers or for the three and a
[766.56 → 772.24] half mid jack they are working on that okay that's coming and then there were also some other devices
[772.24 → 777.84] in device manager that just were still yellow exclamation marks we don't know exactly what they were
[777.84 → 785.28] what they were yeah yeah um did you try all the different input types and everything okay well yeah
[785.28 → 792.56] yeah yeah yeah we tried Bluetooth and USB, and they were both fine uh thumb sticks pads on the back so
[793.76 → 802.24] windows navigation on the steam deck oh boy not great okay because the default behaviour for the steam deck
[802.24 → 812.88] is an is enter b is escape and the ability for applications okay, so first valves did uh
[812.88 → 818.88] valve does allow a steam controller to be used as like a joystick to mouse device okay so you can
[818.88 → 823.12] actually use it to move the mouse around and remember trackpads yeah so you can actually move the mouse
[823.12 → 831.92] around with the trackpad work okay except when it stops okay right yikes all right and if you close
[831.92 → 839.20] steam then is it the trackpad you know the trackpad still works, but the joystick input stops working
[839.20 → 846.08] for the mouse no or something like that but if you have steam open in the background so you can use
[846.08 → 851.60] the joystick or whatever, and you go to open software like retroarch which has controller support
[853.20 → 860.24] retroarch will not grab the controller properly it's being used so what happens is even trying to
[860.24 → 866.24] do something as simple as navigating the menu in retroarch you try to go back you try to just like to go back a
[866.24 → 869.76] couple menus escape retroarch is closed oh no
[872.48 → 880.48] so it's pretty freaking rough it's pretty rough right now and I haven't even gotten to game performance
[881.92 → 890.00] my expectation was that compatibility we didn't test a really broad set of games because quite frankly
[890.24 → 897.12] i I don't feel there was a ton to be learned from that like yeah game compatibility is going to be
[897.12 → 902.96] more windows so if there's anti-cheat software that doesn't run in Linux or that the developer
[903.84 → 909.44] you know intentionally prevents from running on Linux because realistically that's what most of it is these
[909.44 → 915.28] days as far as we can tell if is there's it's either preventing or it's they haven't taken the action to
[915.28 → 924.08] allow it yeah so uh you know whether it's anti-cheat or whether it's just games that proton or what's
[924.08 → 931.76] it called steam play now I think so I forget steam play hasn't caught up to um game compatibility is
[931.76 → 939.60] going to be better but performance well I was expecting it to be I was expecting it to trade blows
[939.60 → 946.08] because we've looked at this before we've run into situations where Linux underperforms windows because
[946.08 → 953.36] trans translation can have a cost we've run into situations where uh the translation has a cost but
[953.36 → 958.72] Linux is also just like lighter, and you end up with them cancelling each other out you get performance
[958.72 → 964.80] parity, and we've even seen situations where the drivers on Linux are better than the proprietary
[964.80 → 969.36] drivers that exist on Windows and Linux actually manages to squeeze more out of the hardware than
[969.36 → 976.88] windows but there tends to be like that back and forth on the steam deck it was just annihilation
[977.68 → 985.36] in all the titles we tested like Linux just ran away from windows and some of this we expected like
[985.36 → 992.72] Elden Ring for example valve has put work specifically into fixing uh I think it's some kind of um
[992.72 → 1002.32] uh oh man like texture optimization thing that they've done uh what is it compiling shaders and
[1002.32 → 1006.16] this was like a big issue on Windows to the point where people were saying it was like almost unplayable
[1006.16 → 1013.52] huge issue on Windows um and so what valve has actually done it's its kind of insane is they've
[1013.52 → 1020.56] taken a feature that um the Elden Ring developers should have implemented in direct x, and they've
[1020.56 → 1026.72] hacked it in as part of the direct x to Vulcan translation very funny and moving out the game
[1026.72 → 1033.84] big move because elder rings freaking huge right now shader yeah shader cache okay um so what's crazy
[1033.84 → 1039.84] about it Elden Ring is so bad that it's its not it's not as simple as just seeing a new asset and
[1039.84 → 1045.60] waiting for it to compile you could even stand in one room and spin around, and it'll stutter constantly
[1046.24 → 1051.76] because it's just not cashing them so right yeah now i remember to be clear Elden Ring itself
[1051.76 → 1057.28] is not bad um I haven't played it yet i actually I started horizon zero dawn on my recent trip and so
[1057.28 → 1060.88] I've been making my way through that I have new thoughts on that by the way I can talk about that
[1060.88 → 1065.60] more later on the show but I'm done now so I've seen you launching I keep on wanting to ask you to
[1065.60 → 1069.68] play halo but I'm like I can't play halo I'm playing I'm steam deck only right now
[1069.68 → 1078.40] man i honestly I have used it almost zero as a desktop though because i I have I i I said it's
[1078.40 → 1084.88] not for work and almost all of my desktop computer usage has been work so I'm just happily gaming on my
[1084.88 → 1092.08] steam deck sort of I'm gonna talk about that later so it was a bloodbath though which really
[1092.08 → 1102.80] surprised me because on paper the rdna2 graphics on the steam deck were terrifying for competitors
[1102.80 → 1107.36] who are stuck with Vega graphics right yeah on their own windows based handhelds but then those
[1107.36 → 1113.92] guys have windows based handhelds, but the thing is that maybe that's if you were able to if the steam
[1113.92 → 1121.60] deck was performing up to its expectations though it is should be better than those windows first
[1121.60 → 1128.32] handhelds running last generation GPU technology that might be interesting because that might actually
[1128.32 → 1135.28] keep a space carved out for those other devices because if like I don't know valve is going to make it
[1135.28 → 1141.12] better well the thing is it's a proprietary driver so should it mostly be down to AMD to make it better
[1141.12 → 1148.72] in that case though I don't know if AMD has much pressure on them from valve yeah maybe AMD has
[1148.72 → 1153.68] very little motivation to make these anything other like if they're straight up saying like
[1153.68 → 1159.12] we are not supporting this then what's the what's the pressure on them to support it better
[1159.12 → 1166.24] you know what I mean yeah so much nothing it might just not get better and if so then at least
[1166.24 → 1170.96] those other devices have a space which is kind of cool yeah and valve has said that when
[1170.96 → 1176.64] the full steam OS 3.0 installer launches they will have support for dual booting, so maybe that's
[1176.64 → 1182.24] just a price they're willing to pay there will be a performance hit, but you can have compatibility
[1182.24 → 1187.36] but we took the safest possible path for everything rather than pushing the performance to the bleeding
[1187.36 → 1192.32] edge because we expect you to do the vast majority of your gaming in steam OS yeah having the ability
[1192.32 → 1201.84] to do a boot on there would be sweet actually now I have uh we get into this in a bit more detail on in
[1201.84 → 1208.64] the video so you'll, you'll still have to watch it haha got him but I want to talk about doing the
[1208.64 → 1214.08] majority of your gaming on steam OS a little bit actually no first I'm going to talk about how there
[1214.08 → 1218.24] are other interface issues with the steam deck like the fact that it doesn't have a task manager
[1218.24 → 1222.96] or a control delete button the quick access menu button doesn't do anything it doesn't have a task
[1222.96 → 1226.56] manager what do you like it doesn't have a task manager button oh so if you're like stuck in a
[1226.56 → 1233.52] full screen application and it, and it hangs just turn it off your sol plug it goes find a keyboard
[1234.24 → 1238.88] plug it in and press control alt delete like you, you're stuck a lot of the windows handhelds will have
[1238.88 → 1244.48] a show desktop button or something or uh like AYA has a software interface that you can bring up to slide
[1244.48 → 1249.92] over top of full screen apps, and you can assign some way to force yourself out exactly, exactly like it's
[1251.44 → 1258.40] it's made to compensate for windows right, so the one not built for windows doesn't have that system
[1258.40 → 1263.92] yeah exactly you're you're going to have these problems so we're ready for you right all right
[1263.92 → 1271.68] which isn't to say that running steam OS on a steam deck is necessarily a flawless victory you know
[1271.68 → 1281.04] perfect experience yeah horizon zero dawn is a verified title on the steam deck and man I was
[1281.04 → 1290.80] blown away I think I'm running at medium 800p like 7 1280 by 800. yeah, uh getting like solid 30 fps uh
[1290.80 → 1297.28] playable you know playable I ran into a weird issue where like aim assist is enabled but I swear it's not
[1297.28 → 1306.16] working like i as far as I can tell and that game I think I talked last week about how tedious a lot of
[1306.16 → 1314.08] the encounters were okay if you don't hit the exact weak points on these fast moving enemies it can be
[1314.08 → 1321.44] like a controller snapper in terms of difficulty you really don't want to snap that controller yeah
[1321.44 → 1327.68] right and I think a big part of the problem is that my auto aim was not doing anything
[1329.28 → 1334.16] which raises some questions that might make sense because I know you brought that up and I remember
[1334.16 → 1338.32] thinking like I don't think I really had a lot of trouble with that but yeah it's probably because
[1338.32 → 1345.04] the aim assist it's probably because something about the steam deck or the steam controller
[1345.04 → 1354.40] is showing up differently to a normal like x input device or something like that so that's
[1355.28 → 1364.24] interesting uh defiance says horizon zero dawn is not a hard game Linus tell you what you go play it
[1364.24 → 1373.44] you go fight a thunder whatever a thunder jaw with a controller with no aim assist I'll wait i actually I got
[1373.44 → 1378.64] significantly better I was playing doom eternal as part of an another video today you're so much better
[1379.44 → 1384.56] and I'm like way better with the controller now after spending like 25 hours in horizon zero dawn
[1384.56 → 1389.84] that makes sense I like people keep what most people talk all the time about how aim assist is like
[1389.84 → 1395.28] cheating, and it's like okay there are maybe some arguments there but using a controller without aim assist
[1395.28 → 1401.60] is just horrible yes so like i yeah you have to have it on yeah thunder jaws aren't that hard actually
[1401.60 → 1407.36] i i I know it's no problem if you can start knocking off components and if I was on a mouse and
[1407.36 → 1413.36] keyboard it would be a non-issue the problem is that I'm on a controller and any controller is going
[1413.36 → 1419.28] to have subtle dead zones so when you're like leaping for bullet time and trying to like to make that really
[1419.28 → 1426.96] small adjustment for that you like jumped it yeah it can be it can be it can be very frustrating uh anyway
[1426.96 → 1432.64] where was I were was I going with this right the first five hours of the game though solid 30 fps
[1432.64 → 1440.08] great experience you get you know the noise bothers me more than it did in the review just the wine
[1440.08 → 1444.16] of the fan like Yvonne was even asking about it, I'm sitting there in bed playing horizon zero dawn and
[1444.16 → 1451.28] she's like what's that noise yeah it's the steam deck fan um I spent most of my time pre-software review
[1451.28 → 1457.52] with earphones in but I've actually been using speakers with it now more just because circumstances
[1457.52 → 1461.84] have dictated that that's been that's been sensible and I'm finding the I'm finding the fan kind of
[1461.84 → 1470.16] annoying basically under half volume it's pretty overpowering after about five hours in I started getting
[1470.16 → 1476.56] all manner of weird issues and I didn't think to whip out a camera and record any of it unfortunately so Anthony's
[1476.56 → 1483.36] asked me to replicate it and the the the good and bad news is that it's going to be real easy
[1483.36 → 1488.64] because at first I started running into these issues like after two continuous hours of gameplay
[1488.64 → 1495.92] where I would get stuttering down to like one fps yikes for 10 30 seconds at a time, and then it would
[1495.92 → 1502.56] like like like catch up oh it does the like fast-forward thing a little bit not quite okay yeah especially
[1502.56 → 1508.56] if it was a cut scene it would be like but like not all the time was accounted for it was very strange
[1508.56 → 1514.56] right yeah, yeah like I wouldn't miss anything even if it was only a short I don't know yeah super weird
[1514.56 → 1523.36] okay uh i saw game crashes just hard crash back to steam interface I even saw
[1524.08 → 1530.56] black screen device unresponsive steam button does nothing quick access menu does nothing
[1531.28 → 1540.00] long press power button full reboot is the only way to solve it and the problem for me is that those as i
[1540.00 → 1552.00] got into the late game started to come up every 20 minutes or so which is pretty bad everything from
[1552.00 → 1563.68] worse stutters to completely game breaking like progress losing issues those are the worst was
[1563.68 → 1569.60] happening so frequently that I mean I told Anthony because he hadn't had that experience he only
[1570.16 → 1576.88] has benchmarked steam deck so far so i was contributing that to our video today and I told
[1576.88 → 1583.44] Anthony like it's it I have gotten more game crashes in my play through of horizon zero dawn than I've
[1583.44 → 1592.72] probably had with every game all combined in the last five years yeah like I get so many crashes and
[1592.72 → 1597.92] again this is and I know you're reviewing the steam deck and this is a verified title and all that kind
[1597.92 → 1603.60] of stuff, but this is why I stopped playing it on pc really oh so you had a lot of crashes in that game on
[1603.60 → 1609.20] yes didn't they mostly fix that though maybe I've heard that they have from the community I have not
[1609.20 → 1614.32] gone back and tried it since um I will at some point because I really want to eventually like to beat that
[1614.32 → 1620.96] game but um yeah it was crashing so hard on me on Windows that I just like refused to keep playing
[1620.96 → 1626.64] because I kept on losing progress and that just rose oh that I hate that it's I think everybody does
[1626.64 → 1634.24] it's just absolutely hate that uh someone said 25 hours is not late game lmao uh for the first
[1634.24 → 1639.28] five to eight I was doing a lot of the side quests but honestly i I figured out what was bothering me
[1639.28 → 1644.96] about the game so much they've built this incredible world they've done all this world building, and it's
[1644.96 → 1652.40] populated with all of these Muppets yeah like almost everyone you talk to like if you turn is you turn
[1652.40 → 1656.96] off the uh the quest indicator that just takes you straight to the person you're supposed to talk to
[1657.60 → 1664.08] you've got all these unique looking people that just repeat the same dozen pre-baked I'm sorry I have
[1664.08 → 1669.92] nothing to talk to you about right now so not having that indicator on is just an utter waste of time
[1669.92 → 1678.40] so if it's this enormous world full of all these settlements and cities that have absolutely no life
[1678.40 → 1684.16] it has a little bit of uh first game in a series syndrome uh like I used to talk about this with
[1684.16 → 1690.00] assassin's creed a fair amount where the first assassin's creed game is like a really cool uh proof
[1690.00 → 1696.64] of concept right there are a lot of things that are like yup that should be a lot better or a lot more
[1696.64 → 1699.76] fleshed out or whatever, and then you get assassin's creed 2, and it's like okay sweet
[1699.92 → 1705.44] here we go this is what we actually wanted um and I have a feeling that uh forbidden west like I've
[1705.44 → 1708.96] heard from a lot of people that these types of problems that you're that you're mentioning
[1708.96 → 1716.16] are fixed or better in forbidden west um so i I think it's I think it's a lot of like they built
[1716.16 → 1722.08] this massive new world it's an it's a similar game to some other games, but they do a fair amount
[1722.08 → 1726.64] of things uniquely, and it's a new IP and all this kind of stuff, so certain things are not really all that
[1726.64 → 1732.08] fleshed out, so after that first like five to eight hours I just got really bored with samey side quests
[1732.08 → 1737.60] and realized that you don't need to grind at all because there's almost zero levelling up progression
[1737.60 → 1741.76] anyway so I just started chasing the main quest and that's a weird problem with modern games some
[1741.76 → 1746.48] modern games if you don't do the side quests you're just like screwed yeah, and then you have to go back
[1746.48 → 1750.16] and do side quests which feels horrible and then there are other games where you don't have to do side
[1750.16 → 1754.56] quests at all, and they like kind of aren't very good because they weren't designed for you to do all of
[1754.56 → 1760.00] them so then you're like oh this sucks when you should have just been doing the main quest it's yeah
[1760.00 → 1766.56] it's kind of weird ran into that a few times recently so I have experienced a ton of instability
[1766.56 → 1775.12] and it really raises questions for me about the QC that's going into verified games right because I have
[1775.12 → 1785.44] no doubt that if I was Sony right I would be not that happy to have you know my name flash up as a
[1785.44 → 1793.28] splash screen on this verified title on some verified console like you think about how defensive companies
[1793.28 → 1800.24] are of their image yeah I mean the verified badge horizon zero dawn on Windows when it was just
[1800.24 → 1805.68] like a broken piece of trash that's fair, but they fixed it apparently maybe yeah yeah people in the
[1805.68 → 1811.20] chat are saying yeah it was a joke at launch, but it's been it's been good I played it recently, and it was
[1811.20 → 1823.12] fine okay um so i, so there's definitely sensitivity around your product yeah being badged as works
[1823.12 → 1831.04] perfectly by someone else, and then it doesn't, and then you're kind of going okay because it's absolutely
[1831.04 → 1836.08] they will get messages about it oh hey why is your game such a buggy mess on steam deck it's verified what
[1836.08 → 1843.28] did you guys do yeah someone will yeah and i just I feel like I feel like with how many titles valve is
[1843.28 → 1849.44] verifying they might be going a little YOLO and a little rubber stamp because my experience with
[1849.44 → 1857.12] horizon zero dawn was that I went five hours in with not a single hiccup and then after that it basically
[1857.12 → 1861.52] got worse and worse and worse and worse and worse they probably didn't you know test it all that much
[1861.52 → 1867.76] so they probably didn't like never mind play testing it they probably didn't play the whole game
[1867.76 → 1874.96] yeah, and you can't, you can't expect it's a fair amount to ask yeah you can't expect you know 20 hours
[1875.52 → 1883.44] in every game or even 10 hours in every game uh for valve to just you know be a charity and contribute
[1883.44 → 1888.72] that time to third-party developers title I was just going to say now you have like whole game studio level
[1888.72 → 1894.40] QA departments just sitting there and playing right that's a weird thing for valve to hire at this
[1894.40 → 1900.56] point except maybe they should are they a console manufacturer now but I don't think console
[1900.56 → 1905.68] manufacturers do that that's on the game developers I'm sure they contribute some QA on their own I mean
[1905.68 → 1911.60] Nintendo made the uh like NVIDIA style where they like employees into companies and stuff oh I'm I'm
[1911.60 → 1916.08] a hundred percent sure that they contribute to QA sure yeah yeah
[1920.24 → 1927.44] very interesting so I'm I'm antsy for mine dude I still don't have an email you can put windows on
[1927.44 → 1933.76] the steam deck but right now we shouldn't for a variety of reasons it looks like an utterly terrible
[1933.76 → 1940.40] idea which i think you nailed it earlier when you said well the silver lining I guess is this
[1940.40 → 1947.84] creates a small opening for those smaller companies that are trying to compete in the handheld pc
[1947.84 → 1954.32] space hopefully actually that small opening is bigger than what already existed before the steam deck
[1954.88 → 1960.48] came into play because steam deck is bringing so many eyes onto this medium because I think a ton of
[1960.48 → 1967.44] people didn't know or if you saw one you'd think it was just a gimmick yeah, but now there's like this
[1967.44 → 1973.04] main line thing adding a bunch of legitimacy to the space and if you're like okay yeah but the game
[1973.04 → 1978.24] that I want to play is Halo Infinite or something that isn't on Linux, and then you see oh there's a
[1978.24 → 1983.12] windows option that actually looks fairly highly reviewed, yet maybe they'll get it yeah it could be i
[1983.12 → 1989.36] mean uh actually I haven't checked uh i and to next I haven't checked in on their Indiegogo
[1989.36 → 1995.84] um and I haven't heard from the I haven't heard from the CEO lately they've uh they've got 382 backers
[1995.84 → 2002.32] and they raised three quarters uh 700 000 Canadians so that's about 550 us just over a half a million
[2002.32 → 2009.68] dollars us so yeah not bad I mean I guarantee you it's not steam deck numbers, but it's not bad
[2009.68 → 2016.32] uh chino chili says Nintendo seal of quality is worthless I think it is now but when they used to be
[2016.32 → 2021.52] primo when they first introduced it, it was a big deal it was one of the things that Nintendo did to
[2021.52 → 2029.04] set themselves apart from just the gaming crash that took place before the n's took hold uh which
[2029.04 → 2036.88] was to keep low quality repetitive crappy games off of their platform they even uh they even enforced
[2036.88 → 2043.12] a limit to how many games a publisher was allowed to submit per year just to ensure that they wouldn't
[2043.12 → 2050.64] just short out more games yeah yeah try to make it up in volume you know, and they would even it wasn't
[2050.64 → 2056.64] even just technical validation they would even offer gameplay suggestions say like hey you should do this
[2056.64 → 2061.84] and you should do that if you want the game to be better it used to be really intense yeah
[2062.56 → 2068.16] yeah i that I don't know talk about it like pretty often yeah I haven't heard it brought up in forever i
[2068.16 → 2073.52] don't know anything about it now yeah me neither uh we should probably bring up merch messages as
[2073.52 → 2080.56] well as the new feature yeah that we are launching on LTT store so we don't have any new products this
[2080.56 → 2085.44] week so still the cable ties that we talked about last week lots of different colours these are actually
[2085.44 → 2090.56] selling really, really well they're a way better deal than they used to be and there's a ton more variety
[2090.56 → 2097.04] also eco-friendly packaging but I love the packaging what we're doing this week is announcing actually you
[2097.04 → 2102.08] know what Luke you should announce it because your team worked on this it's the bonus bin made by the
[2102.08 → 2107.92] same guy that made merch messages which makes sense uh but if you add something to cart uh you can now
[2107.92 → 2114.80] see the bonus bin I'm sharing thing at the top oh yep okay sweet um and there's a kind of what is going
[2114.80 → 2120.96] to be a rotating set of things that you can decide individually uh to add to your cart for free in the
[2120.96 → 2126.64] past I believe you guys had sticker packs yep um now there's two different sticker packs the 2021 one or
[2126.64 → 2134.00] the 2022 one and the GPU wasteland postcard um the postcards currently says post dot dot dot so we
[2134.00 → 2139.60] should probably have some word wrap there or something but um yeah it's there it's cool uh
[2139.60 → 2144.24] we're like I said we're going to add some rotating stuff in the future, so there'll be new things that
[2144.24 → 2148.80] show up here um, and you don't have to add it if you don't want it, but it's just a cool little thing
[2148.80 → 2155.12] that you get for free there's stuff in here uh and there's stuff planned to be in here in the future
[2155.12 → 2161.60] that are like not necessarily cheap from some people um like yeah we're gonna talk about having
[2161.60 → 2166.64] pins and stuff yeah I want to do things like that's not a small item so yeah maybe check out
[2166.64 → 2170.64] the bonus I can tell you they don't cost much so anyone who's charging you a ton of money for a pin
[2170.64 → 2176.24] is I see them go for like 15 bucks I'm not into pins, but there's people that like collect like tons
[2176.24 → 2183.60] of pins I don't know I don't know um but yeah I mean I'll happily charge 15 for them do you guys
[2183.60 → 2188.72] do you guys want them in the bonus bin or should I charge 15 for them because I'm down I'm down I can
[2188.72 → 2195.76] tell you there's a lot of margin in it at 15. I bet i just know I've seen it for like around
[2195.76 → 2202.72] that amount, but yeah bonus bin super cool um I would strongly encourage you guys to uh do the
[2202.72 → 2210.56] GPU wasteland postcard and then send it to us our address is on Google Maps and the idea is that if
[2210.56 → 2217.84] people get these colour them or otherwise decorate them and then send them back to us, we want to
[2217.84 → 2223.44] decorate a wall in the new creator warehouse space with these GPU wasteland postcards so we can all
[2223.44 → 2232.48] remember the glory days of 2020 to 2022. Maybe glory is not the right word that's a little uh you know
[2233.52 → 2247.52] um the glory days hey there you go um but yeah it should be good 15 let's go for 50. Indeed indubitably
[2247.52 → 2255.76] you should have you should make like one like pure gold pin yeah we'll make it a loot box so you won't
[2255.76 → 2263.36] know yeah you won't know if you're going to get like a tin one or a gold one people jokingly bring up in
[2263.36 → 2269.52] float plane meetings every once in a while that we should have loot boxes for emotes so it's just a
[2269.52 → 2278.16] random a random emote which is horrible just completely terrible um but yeah why don't we talk
[2278.16 → 2282.64] about apple's peak performance event well should we do a couple of merch messages uh oh sure yeah
[2282.64 → 2290.40] yeah some curated ones hi Linus I have to get all new network gear for my house long story, and we'll
[2290.40 → 2300.00] soon get 10 gig internet really that's uh that's intense okay that's really intense I'm considering
[2300.00 → 2305.92] ubiquities unify ecosystem do you have any gripes or regrets with your system are there any alternatives
[2305.92 → 2313.04] you'd recommend we've been pretty happy with unify gear at the office here and that includes everything
[2313.04 → 2320.16] from their access points to their switches we have definitely run into some speed bumps, but it should
[2320.16 → 2326.88] be noted that apparently the square ap's that I got way back in the day were just notoriously awful
[2326.88 → 2333.36] they were like the worst product ubiquity ever made and so the fact that i that was my first unify
[2333.36 → 2340.56] experience was I picked up three of those and tried to you know do up my house, and it was just it was it
[2340.56 → 2349.76] was terrible I remember that and I ended up going ruckus after the fact um so I've had some bad
[2349.76 → 2356.88] experiences but a lot of it has been caused by us often using early access unified gear where the
[2356.88 → 2364.48] hardware is baked, but the software is not done yet so yes we've run into issues but man when you want
[2364.48 → 2372.08] bang for the buck prosumer network gear what would you I mean what would you compare it to you pretty
[2372.08 → 2377.28] much kind of come down to ubiquity yeah microtech is pretty sick if you're is you want to get down and
[2377.28 → 2384.48] dirty, and you want to you want to get nerdy and um other than that like what like most of the big
[2384.48 → 2390.88] guys these days want subscription fees for everything and ubiquity is still providing a lot of the same
[2391.60 → 2397.68] software and monitoring and tools, but there's no subscription you just buy the hardware, and you get
[2397.68 → 2408.72] access to that so yeah I would say I would say ubiquity is a an 8.75 out of 10 recommend from me we
[2408.72 → 2414.72] actually just rolled some new ubiquity gear between here and one of the new satellite offices right
[2416.24 → 2426.48] we were up on the roof okay, but we are getting uh greater than gigabit speeds between the two and
[2426.48 → 2433.60] and sub one millisecond latency accessing machines that are in a completely different building
[2434.16 → 2442.08] on the same land that's so we don't get any of the security and overhead issues involved in doing
[2442.08 → 2450.48] like a VPN from one location to the next no like no, no encryption overhead is this a static installation
[2450.48 → 2454.80] like you're leaving it there yeah oh that's just straight over the air that's really cool yeah I'm
[2454.80 → 2465.28] really excited that's awesome super cool uh oh what am I looking at here oh click to view more oh, oh
[2465.28 → 2471.84] there's a new interface here uh oh Landon everything including gaming hardware is getting more expensive
[2471.84 → 2476.40] fast with things like steam deck and laptops getting more and more powerful what does an entry-level setup
[2476.40 → 2481.52] look like in five to ten years will game desktops eventually die out I mean that was part of the idea
[2481.52 → 2490.16] behind me daily driving the steam deck for a month was to find out is this handheld which realistically
[2490.16 → 2496.72] has hardware in it that would have been gaming laptop grade only a few short years ago good enough
[2496.72 → 2502.88] to daily drive I think are we already there I think even if it's just for one day like it's a portable
[2502.88 → 2510.16] device you should use it at work as your work computer yeah it's just a lot of software crap to figure out
[2510.16 → 2517.36] to use for one day that's probably fair i just I feel like have you done like any actual personal
[2517.36 → 2523.20] computing on it has it just been games I've only gamed yeah like I feel like you're going to get to the
[2523.20 → 2528.16] end of this and have done no personal computing and that's like a pretty important part of well
[2528.16 → 2533.52] what's my boss going to do get mad at me, I just mean I'll just extend the video I'll extend the challenge
[2533.52 → 2538.00] another 30 days and I'll like force myself to do it if I feel like it, I mean don't do that because you
[2538.00 → 2542.56] you have to come back and play halo you've seen how stuck on horizon zero dawn I've been lately yeah
[2542.56 → 2548.48] I'm like constantly in their yeah and I feel left out because every time I'm on steam I'm the
[2548.48 → 2553.20] bottom right-handed Coltrane is playing elder burnt banana is playing everyone's just I haven't played
[2553.20 → 2557.84] it, yet everyone's just playing elder everyone's playing elder rings and I'm like i picked
[2557.84 → 2563.28] completely the not trendy open world game to play oh what I have no idea what I'm doing
[2566.00 → 2573.92] oh man but yeah i I think it's entirely possible at the price of the steam deck it's the best computer
[2573.92 → 2580.96] you can buy for 400 hands down oh yeah I'd say go for it absolutely especially because you can't even
[2580.96 → 2589.36] get a desktop computer with a GPU in it for 400 yeah hey Linus asks Joshua how did the twitch chat is
[2589.36 → 2597.28] awful things start and why be so mean to twitch viewers well that's actually a fascinating
[2597.28 → 2602.88] story and to answer it we kind of have to go way back to before it was twitched TV we have to go all the
[2602.88 → 2609.44] way back to when it was justin.tv and rather than being a game focused site it was actually more focused
[2609.44 → 2618.64] on like uh bootleg live shows and uh sporting events yeah and um pretty much everyone was toxic
[2618.64 → 2628.16] and awful and I made the astute observation that as a community they are toxic and awful and um they
[2628.16 → 2636.48] never changed nice yeah yeah twitch chat I love you're awful yeah that's a perfect i I love you
[2636.48 → 2642.88] you're awful is a wonderful way of saying that yeah yeah twitch prime by the way uh also any updates
[2642.88 → 2649.28] on backpack screwdriver or short circuit hoodie no I have no updates other than soon
[2652.64 → 2655.52] uh we'll do one more and then let's jump into the Apple event
[2658.00 → 2661.44] no idea how to pronounce that been watching for years love your hot takes oh thanks
[2662.32 → 2669.20] what do you think about hardware VPNs slash decentralized VPNs saw a video from unbox therapy
[2669.20 → 2678.72] and I'm not sure about the privacy aspect ah yes I saw that video from unbox therapy as well
[2678.72 → 2685.52] and it's something that's been on our radar basically what it is the idea that I think I pitched to you
[2685.52 → 2691.04] on wan show at some point I either pitched it to you on wan show or I've talked about it internally
[2691.04 → 2699.12] like oh wouldn't that be a really cool way to do a VPN where basically everyone is um it's kind of like
[2699.12 → 2704.64] how yeah everyone's a node, and it's kind of like how windows is our windows it's kind of like how Microsoft
[2704.64 → 2711.44] is rolling Windows updates now where you contribute to the network to make sure that you know okay say Luke
[2711.44 → 2716.80] and I live in the same apartment building rather than him downloading off of a Microsoft server in
[2716.80 → 2721.92] Redmond obviously that's not typically how it would be that Microsoft would have the files cached on a
[2721.92 → 2728.00] data centre closer to Luke but rather than pulling the files out of a data centre he would just grab them
[2728.64 → 2735.52] in as few hops as possible from a newer node like me in order to accelerate download speeds as well as
[2735.52 → 2740.40] reduce latency and overall internet congestion it's actually like a win-win-win
[2740.40 → 2746.80] to have multiple nodes for downloads rather than centralized servers in some cases like we've
[2746.80 → 2752.56] seen situations where a major gaming launch has dragged the internet down to a crawl and that
[2752.56 → 2758.32] wouldn't have necessarily had to happen with a decentralized file distribution system like uh
[2758.32 → 2766.80] like bit torrent for example um so the product that Lou was taking a look at
[2766.80 → 2773.68] was pretty much the idea that I had talked about before where instead of being for file distribution
[2774.24 → 2784.88] these nodes were for um internet access from that location what's really cool about this approach is
[2784.88 → 2789.60] that by contributing a little bit of your bandwidth and many people have unlimited data plans these days
[2789.60 → 2794.96] by contributing some of your bandwidth and some of your both download and upload speed right because the
[2794.96 → 2801.52] traffic has to come all the way through you are gaining access to other users in other regions
[2802.24 → 2809.28] who are contributing their bandwidth to you so that you can access services and uh and websites as
[2809.28 → 2815.84] though you are from that region just like a VPN would but what gives it a big advantage over a traditional VPN
[2815.84 → 2823.84] is that service providers are constantly trying to block VPNs from accessing their services and there's
[2823.84 → 2829.76] a hundred reasons that might exist for this whether it's authoritarian regimes that don't want access to
[2829.76 → 2835.92] outside information coming across their borders or whether it's companies that have complicated licensing
[2835.92 → 2842.00] agreements that allow them to display content in one country but not in another country because the internet
[2842.00 → 2849.60] doesn't exist in their world view um there are lots of reasons why they will aggressively pursue
[2849.60 → 2855.68] these users who are accessing their content from another region because in some cases it can open them
[2855.68 → 2861.68] up to serious legal liability if they are found to be not doing their due diligence to enforce the terms
[2861.68 → 2868.48] of their license and so there's this constant game of whack-a-mole where VPN providers are trying to find ways
[2868.48 → 2877.12] to use safe non-blocked IPS that are registered to that region and service providers are trying to find
[2877.12 → 2885.12] ways to play whack-a-mole and ban IP blocks that are associated with these VPN services and it's at the
[2885.12 → 2890.48] point now where a company like shadow tech you remember shadow tech they had like gaming servers
[2890.48 → 2894.16] they're still around in data centres I don't know if they're still doing it but they were for a
[2894.16 → 2900.96] while anyway and then they had a whole like insolvency thing but shadow tech um had the challenge of
[2900.96 → 2908.16] trying to find a way to get their like they actually had to work through services like Netflix to get
[2908.16 → 2918.16] their IP blocks unbanned because it got to the point where service providers just basically said okay we're
[2918.16 → 2928.24] just going to just block list ever yip that's associated with a data centre because any commercial
[2928.24 → 2933.52] VPN service that is running out of a data centre is going to be on these IP blocks and really there's
[2933.52 → 2940.40] no reason that you know some cloud server for some infrastructure is going to need to watch movies on
[2940.40 → 2947.28] Netflix anyway so the fact that there were consumers using these data centre IPS was a challenge that
[2947.28 → 2952.16] they had to solve and it was as simple as getting Netflix to allow them they were just they just had
[2952.16 → 2959.12] to demonstrate that it was not inordinate use coming through this IP which is pretty trivial for
[2959.12 → 2965.20] them to detect okay you know five people or whatever the amount they allow per account it could not
[2965.20 → 2973.36] possibly be watching this much Bridgerton or whatever right um and where was I going with this right
[2973.36 → 2979.12] right right right, so the advantage is that by having all of these nodes it becomes extremely
[2979.12 → 2986.96] difficult to play that game of whack-a-mole efficiently right to just mass ban anything that
[2986.96 → 2992.24] could possibly be associated with a commercial service and move on to the next thing and because
[2992.88 → 3000.64] theoretically if the network gets large enough that traffic could be spread out so much it would be
[3000.64 → 3006.08] it would be really hard for them to even detect it through like a brute force method like looking
[3006.08 → 3011.12] at how much use is coming through it and blocking that IP now they could get aggressive and start
[3011.12 → 3017.60] trying to to to block everything that they suspect is a multiple user, but they'd end up irking a lot of
[3017.60 → 3023.04] customers and now that Netflix charges so much you don't want to you don't want to create friction with
[3023.04 → 3030.56] your legitimate paying customer right so any overly aggressive attempt to curb undesirable behaviour
[3030.64 → 3036.72] like hosting a VPN that other users are tunnelling through that runs the risk of causing people
[3036.72 → 3041.52] to cancel your service which doesn't look great on your you know quarterly revenue reports because
[3041.52 → 3045.92] you're a public company right I mean there are a lot of places where there isn't really ISP competition
[3047.12 → 3052.56] that's that's fair especially in the states but I meant for Netflix people could cancel that service
[3052.56 → 3060.80] yeah yeah and that's not a good look yeah um winter says just use a Pia static IP and generate a new
[3060.80 → 3066.32] one each month that service that Pia offers if I recall does it cost more I can't remember uh but
[3066.32 → 3075.92] that service that Pia offers is difficult to maintain finding new especially ipv4 IPS these days
[3075.92 → 3082.48] it's not well it's easy, but it's not cheap yeah is what I will is what I will say about that
[3084.16 → 3093.20] I don't know there 's's so the downside yeah all of your internet traffic is going through some
[3094.16 → 3104.48] midpoint that you do not control kind of same vice versa on that coin theoretically there's a
[3104.48 → 3113.20] a bunch of you are encrypting it before it goes through, but my understanding is that there's no
[3113.20 → 3119.68] way to encrypt what comes back to you yeah um
[3122.56 → 3129.20] yeah I mean almost everything is http snow like it's there's still some that isn't though you're right
[3129.20 → 3131.92] it's there's still some that's a lot of people who are in the states especially like government websites
[3131.92 → 3138.24] which I find very funny um low level like uh municipal government websites I find a lot of them
[3138.24 → 3149.36] kind of still aren't um I don't know i I've read some stuff that apparently like certain uh what are they
[3149.36 → 3155.92] called deeper or whatever uh deeper network apparently I don't know I've read some stuff on this i I wasn't
[3155.92 → 3161.84] prepared for this topic so I'm sorry um but I've read that they're they're looking to be more open
[3161.84 → 3167.12] about certain things not that they've necessarily been notably closed off about certain things but
[3167.12 → 3172.08] they're they're interested in being more open about certain things like it's it I don't know it could be
[3172.08 → 3178.56] very interesting it's a little sketch though in my opinion I'm gonna maybe invite a surprise guest to
[3178.56 → 3185.68] the show let's see if he picks up uh hey Dan you're um wait I forget is it Dan or Dany Dann's good
[3185.68 → 3192.40] great um you're on the wan show so you're you're live right now I was talking about how ipv4 addresses
[3192.40 → 3197.92] are getting I won't say difficult to obtain but certainly expensive to obtain, and we've had some
[3197.92 → 3203.20] people in the chat kind of saying well they can't be that expensive uh you know surely you know you
[3203.20 → 3208.40] could afford them easily Linus but I remember the last time I talked to you about this being just
[3208.40 → 3215.52] utterly blown away by how expensive it was for a block of ipv4 addresses and I was wondering if
[3215.52 → 3222.00] you'd be willing to kind of give us the latest on that yeah it's about 50 bucks us and IP right now
[3222.00 → 3230.72] buying in bulk per IP and that's up from a year ago about 24 and that's that's you know finite resource
[3230.72 → 3238.08] rapidly depleted, and the price is raising by almost 100 a year so you're saying that if I wanted to
[3238.08 → 3246.00] invest instead of Vancouver real estate I should actually buy ipv4 addresses you could, you'd have
[3246.00 → 3252.88] to get an ASN, and you know be an ISP and then get a in to let you have an allocation and then you
[3252.88 → 3258.64] could go buy them, but you could do that okay, but you'd sort that out for me right sure okay all right
[3258.64 → 3263.44] all right cool uh thanks Dan good chat I guess we haven't talked in a long time, but that means the
[3263.44 → 3269.84] service is working well so that's a good thing um yeah good to hear no problem all right talk to you
[3269.84 → 3277.44] later man yeah have a good one okay bye um that that's item our ISP is amazing um I don't know if
[3277.44 → 3283.68] everyone gets the same kind of service but I can literally call up their CTO pretty much whatever i
[3283.68 → 3288.96] want and ask them stuff uh so they've they've helped us do some really, really cool stuff with our connection
[3288.96 → 3293.68] we pay dearly for the service yeah uh and I'm not sure how much sense it's going to make forever
[3293.68 → 3298.40] hopefully he doesn't watch this because Telus now has two and a half gig residential connections
[3298.40 → 3306.48] just like bond a couple of those probably fine, but anyway the point is yeah 50 freaking bucks yeah
[3308.24 → 3315.60] we have to get IPS for flow plane right so it's a lot of freaking money yeah and that's bulk yeah do you
[3315.60 → 3319.36] oh do you know how much we pay through flow plane because we're buying it much lower volumes than
[3319.36 → 3325.44] them uh I mean I could figure it out yeah it's okay don't worry too much about it though but um
[3326.88 → 3331.84] oh crap what was I going to say yeah just everything's getting worse like you, you know we're working on the
[3331.84 → 3339.12] the infrastructure 2.0 stuff servers that we want to get for that like when we first started working
[3339.12 → 3344.08] with OVH you probably even remember this I would procure a server, and it would be up in like minutes
[3345.60 → 3349.68] superfast some of the stuff that we're getting now is like we're getting them to customize the
[3349.68 → 3353.52] hardware and stuff so yeah that's going to take a moment longer yeah but like you expect okay maybe
[3353.52 → 3360.56] you know tomorrow or something right now it's like hmm not sure might be done by the end of the month
[3361.52 → 3367.68] yeah like oh man heart like everything in that space is just getting so rough it makes sense though
[3367.68 → 3373.68] with like I mean we've had chip shortage for going on for so long now and so many things are going
[3373.68 → 3380.08] online and the online space is just massively exploding as it has been for years so yeah I don't
[3380.08 → 3385.60] know it's interesting how much the internet has changed even in the last 10 years because like yeah
[3385.60 → 3392.48] sure it's existed but the amount the degree to which it's ubiquitous at this point is its web 3.0 now
[3395.04 → 3401.60] it's the metaverse have we talked about this on the show how painful is it for you someone who
[3401.60 → 3407.20] participated in wow classic like wow vanilla I shouldn't say classic I should say wow vanilla
[3409.36 → 3418.72] like in a big way in the community of wow vanilla how painful is it for you to have what you did and
[3418.72 → 3427.52] lived through over 10 years ago co-opted into a marketing term that for something that makes no
[3427.52 → 3433.20] sense, and it's been driving me nuts i i I don't know if we've talked about this too much I know i
[3433.20 → 3440.48] think I brought up on wan show before but what is it I don't know it's not anything how are you
[3440.48 → 3444.96] start you just talking about this you're like oh yeah we're gonna work on the metaverse what is it
[3445.52 → 3450.72] what's the metaverse because it's not one thing that's been the crazy thing for me like yeah Facebook
[3450.72 → 3457.12] is making something sure but not everyone's just going to use Facebook's thing so then
[3458.00 → 3464.48] it's not one thing then like what are you doing oh man it's driving me nuts there's no like
[3464.48 → 3470.48] centralized one service and no one's ever going to be wants to be if it's not going to happen and no
[3470.48 → 3475.44] one's ever going to be cool with that you think Microsoft's just going to be chill that like Facebook
[3475.44 → 3482.40] owns the entire metaverse no that's not going to happen i just god it's been driving me so nuts
[3483.28 → 3491.20] oh there's like there's no there 's's one buzzword and no plan at all but there's so much
[3491.20 → 3496.24] money being poured into this thing that just like doesn't oh we should just change our name to
[3496.24 → 3505.04] Linus metaverse group uh I mean you could, it wouldn't and then go IPO be like yeah we're working on we're
[3505.04 → 3512.56] working on educational content for the metaverse first we had text then we had pictures then we had
[3512.56 → 3520.16] video in the future we'll have leg content whatever you want to call it yeah you got to call it something
[3520.16 → 3524.80] yeah it's like choose it's choose your own adventure information delivery in the metaverse never been
[3524.80 → 3532.48] done before yeah yeah we should do it we should totally do it so we we do like we do um uh, uh
[3532.48 → 3540.72] what are they called uh tuber we do tuber Linus okay yes, and we do like uh because
[3540.72 → 3545.76] you can totally do this with animation software you record the voiceover and it just automatically
[3545.76 → 3551.36] syncs the gum flapping yeah yeah yeah um i honestly i I've talked I've talked about this before if I was
[3551.36 → 3559.04] smart okay I would be tuber transitioning now so it's a video but like the whole background is transparency
[3559.04 → 3564.08] so it's you you you host it on like a green screen, but it's a tuber so whatever but everything other
[3564.08 → 3568.88] than the tuber is a green screen yeah and the green screen is just what's actually in front of you and
[3568.88 → 3575.12] so when you're wearing AR glasses you just have like the little tuber in the corner yeah and metaverse
[3575.12 → 3582.00] Linus sits and like talks to you yeah about and then and then we build a software team like an AI
[3582.00 → 3589.20] machine learning software team so that you can ask for tech tips and metaverse Linus will give you tech tips
[3589.20 → 3592.24] and it's basically bonsai buddy, and you can
[3593.84 → 3599.20] or like there's an old reference like Microsoft paperclip so you can have like what's that what's
[3599.20 → 3604.00] that burger place in Taiwan that you don't like moss burger oh it's disgusting okay so you can have
[3604.00 → 3608.48] it so that when you're walking out with your AR glasses what do you think of this restaurant line
[3608.48 → 3613.92] look at moss burger Linus can be like it's not good you shouldn't go there because blah blah blah blah
[3615.92 → 3624.48] metaverse linus metagroup oh man I'm ready what metaverse I'm so ready well it doesn't matter
[3625.12 → 3632.08] because you just raise VC money from people who have more so much money that making more of it is just a
[3632.08 → 3638.08] game like it's its like I remember when we reached a point in our business and i I still don't
[3638.08 → 3643.52] behave like this personally but when it comes to the business we reached a point where our budgeting
[3643.52 → 3651.60] changed when we started out our budgeting was based on how many dollars and cents um we have in our bank
[3651.60 → 3660.56] account yeah that was how we budgeted and at some point it changed, and it changed to k's we just we
[3660.56 → 3666.24] stopped talking in terms of dollars, and we started talking in terms of k's okay this new salary is going
[3666.24 → 3674.32] to be this many k's and the expected ROI stages you go to m's we're not going to m's I could, I can tell
[3674.32 → 3680.96] you that I'm just saying some people do actually oh we do have some m level projects yeah we're not
[3680.96 → 3686.08] gonna we're not going to get there though we're we're we're we're we're a k's driven company yeah so we
[3686.08 → 3692.00] reached a point where it started to become okay uh this is the outlay in case and this is the expected
[3692.00 → 3698.64] return in case over some period of time x and that started to be how we thought about things and
[3699.52 → 3707.28] for your VCS where it's just you know the don't actually think about anything in terms of whether you
[3707.28 → 3713.92] can afford it or not you're just thinking about it in terms of m's and percentage uplift year over
[3713.92 → 3722.00] year it's just like growing the dragon horde right uh there's just so much money flying around
[3723.12 → 3730.48] that it's its just it's one fad after another yeah, and it's just it's bizarre to me, it's like
[3730.48 → 3737.20] it's like the no one remembers the dot-com bubble ever happened you see the winners right they won
[3737.20 → 3742.32] another one you see the Amazon that came out of the dot-com bubble did anybody else emerge from the dot-com
[3742.32 → 3751.36] bubble well yeah probably but like that yeah no, no I was looking at who was I looking at that like
[3751.36 → 3757.04] still hadn't recovered their dot it was like a major company that still hadn't restored their
[3757.04 → 3763.52] they're like fortune Fortune 500 but still were not valued the way they were in the dot-com bubble
[3763.52 → 3769.20] I don't know like there's not many companies uh PayPal eBay are a couple that people yeah okay
[3769.20 → 3775.20] there are some that did, but it's like a handful the number that went just completely
[3775.20 → 3782.64] disappeared with all trace of any money put into them vanished in a flurry of Herman miller chairs on
[3782.64 → 3792.08] Craigslist like what do you want jams when you want nothing he wants for nothing ladies and gentlemen
[3792.08 → 3796.96] I'll have a licorice thank you oh I don't want the whole thing oh there's not that many okay yeah
[3796.96 → 3802.00] that's fine I accept it then you want a licorice take a single one all right heck yeah I haven't eaten
[3802.00 → 3813.20] on Sancho in forever this might work this is great um it's a metaverse yeah all right it's just
[3813.76 → 3818.48] it's actually it actually triggers me there aren't that many things that just can immediately set
[3818.48 → 3824.48] me off but whenever I see anything talking about metaverse i just I flip because like there's this
[3824.48 → 3833.12] there's just nothing there what are you talking about NFTs at least like at least that has a clear
[3834.24 → 3842.40] the like yeah it's total BS but at least it's clear what the BS is trying to do its horse armour
[3842.40 → 3848.24] yeah at least you get some armour for the horse I guess I don't know the metaverse is just like
[3848.24 → 3852.88] remember the Walmart thing was it Walmart I think it was Walmart the like Walmart metaverse shopping
[3852.88 → 3858.32] experience video did you ever see that I didn't see if it's just like what is this where is this
[3858.32 → 3865.12] supposed to go like is this going Facebook or is this just another VR application and if it's just
[3865.12 → 3871.12] another VR application why are you calling it metaverse it's just VR shopping which is completely fine
[3872.40 → 3877.52] like there's no problem with that that's I mean people were Memling on it because it's like weird
[3877.52 → 3882.96] to shop in Walmart and VR, and it's like yeah sure you know what I'm not going to defend that part but
[3882.96 → 3888.08] like it's its whatever it's just a's a VR thing maybe it becomes normal maybe it doesn't who cares
[3889.04 → 3896.32] but it's not meta like why are we co-oping this name from a book from quite a while ago which
[3896.32 → 3901.36] is apparently cool or whatever I haven't read it, but apparently it's good and that's fine but why are we
[3901.36 → 3906.80] just co-oping this word for like something that Facebook is potentially doing which sounds like
[3906.80 → 3913.36] uh Zuckerberg is just going nuts and wants to spend money on something um and wanted to like shift
[3913.36 → 3919.52] attention from his company getting sued by everyone on the planet to just the stupidest name slash
[3919.52 → 3923.84] project that has like ever existed in the tech space in a long time i just yeah
[3923.84 → 3930.96] it actually just bothers me so much because it's nothing like someone I watched
[3930.96 → 3935.68] someone talking about how I didn't think he was going to go for this long sorry I watched someone
[3935.68 → 3941.92] talking about how uh mark must have never played VR chat yeah because like everything that they've
[3941.92 → 3948.80] tried to show off for Facebook metaverse is just a bad version of VR chat, and it's like yeah i completely
[3948.80 → 3956.48] agree i I know anyway sorry we can go talk about something else no I love it I'm having so much fun
[3956.48 → 3961.60] right now I mean it was already feeling like kind of a Linus heavy episode, and so I was like hmm
[3962.56 → 3968.80] you know what I said i just I haven't I haven't played with steam deck right so I can't really say
[3968.80 → 3977.04] a lot about it, I know it's great okay I will defend one aspect of the metaverse to you okay you have
[3977.04 → 3985.68] to try not to bite my head off about it sure if they achieve some level of interoperability okay so
[3986.80 → 3997.28] if Facebook's metaverse where you are like cross play sure where there's a café in the
[3997.28 → 4004.48] McDonald's in the Walmart or there's a there's a seating area stop okay, so there's a seating area
[4004.48 → 4017.92] in the Walmart's McDonald's where you can sit stop where you can where you can sit
[4017.92 → 4023.60] and you can pull up your VR sorry metaverse phone
[4025.84 → 4030.00] and call one of your Facebook contacts probably your aunt
[4032.80 → 4036.16] there won't be anyone young it's the only reason why anyone uses Facebook anymore
[4036.16 → 4045.36] extended family, and then they appear, and you could you and your metaverse avatars could leave what an
[4045.36 → 4051.76] amazing there okay you leave there you go into the Walmart, and you help her pick out a TV
[4052.88 → 4062.48] okay in the metaverse and then the TV arrives at her house okay if there's some kind of movement
[4063.20 → 4073.68] between like these islands of experiences then it will be compelling but you can mark my
[4073.68 → 4079.28] words here was that you guys met at McDonald's and went to Walmart the movement was the integration
[4079.28 → 4085.44] between multiple platforms okay, so the multiple platforms are McDonald's and Walmart so Walmart has
[4085.44 → 4091.28] contributed their layout of their store and their product selection and shopping experience and
[4091.28 → 4098.88] McDonald's has contributed creating meetup places, and they have engaged with Facebook to have integration
[4098.88 → 4104.80] for your contacts so that you can meet and make recommendations to each other, so this is part of
[4104.80 → 4111.28] my core problem, but you can mark my words that will never happen and this is part of my core problem
[4111.28 → 4116.40] is like what you're kind of talking about is almost apps working with each other on a platform
[4116.40 → 4122.64] and Facebook metaverse is the platform yeah but no one's going to let that happen yeah I know without
[4122.64 → 4127.52] having competing platforms and so like yes that might be a thing it's going to be smart homes all over again
[4127.52 → 4132.40] yeah so yes that might be a thing maybe there's going to be competing platforms right so Microsoft
[4132.40 → 4138.80] has one Amazon has one Facebook has one google has one apple has one everyone under the Netflix somehow
[4138.80 → 4145.84] finds a way to insert themselves um whatever then there's going to be the Walmart shopping experience
[4145.84 → 4152.16] for all of those and the Microsoft meetup or sorry the McDonald's meetup experience for all of those
[4152.16 → 4160.96] videos, but you still have people stuck on other metaverses, or you know versions of VR chat whatever
[4160.96 → 4169.20] you want to call it uh and so like what's the point I just keep coming back to like why because we
[4169.20 → 4175.04] already have this problem where there's okay we have VR, but some people are on index and some people are on
[4175.04 → 4180.08] oculus and some people are on different versions of oculus so they can't run the same thing and yeah some
[4180.08 → 4185.04] people are playing uh beat safer, but some people have custom beat safer so they can play custom
[4185.04 → 4188.72] songs and other people don't and like there's already these problems, and it's just going to
[4188.72 → 4194.96] fragment it even more and developing something for v metaverse doesn't mean anything because there isn't one
[4196.72 → 4202.56] and I just keep coming back to that core problem it's like okay this app transferability the
[4202.56 → 4209.52] cross play whatever it doesn't matter because there isn't one metaverse chasing Saul says
[4210.08 → 4215.04] metaverse is entirely a method of removing money from someone else and giving it to someone else yeah
[4215.84 → 4226.32] uh this is uh this xkcd comic um is basically it in a nutshell some of you guys go go go buy the
[4226.32 → 4233.52] book go buy their book or something because technically this is their copyrighted comic, and we're being bad
[4233.52 → 4238.48] right now um but help, help us make sure that they get some money I don't see a donated
[4239.20 → 4243.76] I wanted to donate but I don't see a donate link on the thing so you guys can also throw in the chat but
[4243.76 → 4252.16] this is amazing this is it in a nutshell how standards proliferate yes ac chargers character encodings
[4252.16 → 4260.00] instant messaging etc situation there are 14 competing standards 14 ridiculous we need to develop one universal
[4260.00 → 4267.44] standard that covers everyone's use cases yeah soon situation there are 15 competing standards and that
[4267.44 → 4276.16] yep is why the metaverse will never happen oh apparently it's creative commons uh attribution so I'm good
[4276.80 → 4283.36] heck yeah, thank you xkcd you go buy their book anyway yeah do it anyway yeah people gotta eat all right
[4283.36 → 4289.92] there's not even any ads on this page limit zero in full plane chat said uh just make metaverse an
[4289.92 → 4295.36] industry standard of intercompatibility so your steam VR avatar is working oculus etc no they won't
[4295.36 → 4300.72] yeah, but that's the comic I just showed you yeah someone else will want to own the platform yes and
[4300.72 → 4305.20] that's that's what I'm saying is the people at play right now are not going to allow it to be
[4305.20 → 4309.84] one system owned by one person and all those people at play are going to want to own the system
[4309.84 → 4316.24] because you're talking about like you were just talking about how we deal in k's you're talking
[4316.24 → 4323.12] about companies that deal in bees yes these guys want to own the whole thing yes because there will
[4323.12 → 4328.72] be lots more bees where they came from yeah I mean you're talking you're talking someone who literally
[4328.72 → 4338.96] is building a volcanic island fortress okay you're talking someone who is literally going to space yeah in
[4338.96 → 4345.76] a giant penis rocket for fun that would be trying to race each other that would be such a fun like
[4345.76 → 4353.68] Saturday night live sketch like guess that billionaire they just say these like comically
[4354.40 → 4360.80] comically evil things that actual billionaires are actually doing or have done deconstruct a historical
[4360.80 → 4365.92] bridge to move their yacht yeah exactly build a new island that's an eye that's that's a duplicate one
[4365.92 → 4371.84] now there's more than one oh the yacht no, no no I mean uh I mean I was already uh I already had a
[4371.84 → 4379.92] Bezos one oh yeah yeah he's just so easy I know he's so easy yeah actually looks like dr evil
[4383.92 → 4395.52] that'd be pretty good invaded a country yeah oh, oh on that note oh yeah oh sponsors no, no uh uh uh cross code
[4395.52 → 4401.04] cross code is part of the Ukraine support bundle where is it oh that's cool it's one of my favourite
[4401.04 → 4405.20] games you guys should go buy it this is not I don't think it's part of the Ukraine support bundle but i
[4405.20 → 4411.20] was going to stream uh and then I wasn't able to sorry I was busy uh but I was going to stream metro
[4411.20 → 4417.92] because metro this metro series of games is from a Ukrainian developer and the publisher for it is doing
[4417.92 → 4423.28] this like huge supporting thing they donated like a million dollars or something it was huge
[4423.28 → 4430.24] they did I think they did 500 grand of their own money, and then they did 500 grand of employee matched
[4430.24 → 4436.32] funds so I think if you include the employees it ends up being 1.5 million I think but I'm not certain
[4436.88 → 4447.76] okay rock paper shotgun has an article about it where is it itching.io is it still available yeah here it is
[4447.76 → 4454.48] okay so we're going to throw this in the chat guys uh there's a ton of games in here just it's awesome
[4454.48 → 4460.72] one of my all-time favourites is cross code it's a retro style action RPG whoa I didn't realize how many
[4460.72 → 4468.40] oh yeah 992 yeah what the heck yeah we're going to have to wait can you change your contribution
[4468.40 → 4472.72] amount there's got to be a way to change your contribution amount oh yeah yeah yeah so I'll, I'll
[4472.72 → 4479.36] I'll make sure that I buy it another copy of that game won't hurt and uh also support for Ukraine
[4479.36 → 4485.68] can't hurt they've raised over 4.2 million dollars I guess I know they have a new game in the works uh
[4485.68 → 4493.36] Rubí Sendai I'm very excited because honestly the best way for me to describe cross code is it's the game
[4493.36 → 4500.48] that I would have made if I stopped doing everything I was doing and started a game development studio and was
[4500.48 → 4505.52] good at it there's some really legit games in here by the way um I'm just like scrolling through really
[4505.52 → 4513.12] quick super hot if you enjoy fps games is just fantastic unique um which is good
[4513.12 → 4519.20] in that universe there 's's lots of really tower falls great just lots of fun with the bros and
[4519.20 → 4525.68] rosettes yeah uh what else we got in here let's let's pick some lets have some Linus and Luke's picks
[4525.68 → 4530.16] here as we go through here well there's Celeste up above I scrolled past because I didn't
[4530.16 → 4536.88] know we were going to keep going but slashed is very good but you guys are going to want to come
[4536.88 → 4543.20] check this out for sure there's a lot of stuff I've never heard of which is fine makes sense there's a
[4543.20 → 4550.00] lot of games out there but I would buy it for cross code alone super hot also I think that one's worth the
[4550.00 → 4555.20] price of admission alone have you played super hot in VR I have its lots of fun it's so good
[4555.20 → 4561.84] yeah it's really fun save cracking simulator that's probably pretty cool might be terrible
[4561.84 → 4566.96] I haven't actually seen almost anything else that I recognize but I don't even care there's so many
[4566.96 → 4570.08] that it would take you so long to go through all of them anyway yeah
[4572.64 → 4576.16] there are a bunch of things in here that I've I've like to come across them but I haven't played them
[4576.16 → 4584.32] myself hi name I'm dad how to be a dad in two simple steps okay that seems like it might be a
[4584.32 → 4589.12] bit of a stretch to call that a game but I don't again I don't know maybe you just showed out in
[4589.12 → 4594.40] chat if there's uh cool games in here that you would recommend people try out yeah for sure guys go have a
[4594.40 → 4601.44] look all right uh we should definitely do sponsor spots though you're right yeah also didn't I say we
[4601.44 → 4606.56] were going to start talking about the Apple event, and we just never did I think so okay yeah we will
[4606.56 → 4616.80] do that we will do that I promise um we are sponsored by jump cloud is launching a
[4616.80 → 4622.40] new i.t community for i.t professionals when they talk about all where they talk about all things i.t
[4622.40 → 4627.44] and share best practices career guidance industry topics and jump cloud products they're creating a
[4627.44 → 4630.88] variety of guides and templates that are helpful for i.t admins in their everyday work
[4630.88 → 4634.88] as well as career spotlights for those in the field so you can watch for experts to join and
[4634.88 → 4639.52] provide even more value jump clouds i.t meetup network is also kicking off so you'll have
[4639.52 → 4645.68] opportunities to meet local colleagues and share virtually and in person now that in-person meetups
[4645.68 → 4652.32] are a thing yeah bc just removed the mask mandate last night at midnight so we are uh we officially
[4652.32 → 4658.16] removed ours here in the office today we're especially beard people are very excited about that
[4658.88 → 4663.68] it's been it's been rough so join jump cloud as they build one its community to rule them all at

[4771.20 → 4777.76] percent when you use the link in the video description we should talk about the Apple event yeah
[4779.12 → 4783.84] I feel like the whole world already has yeah but in standard wan show fashion you get the news at the
[4783.84 → 4790.32] end of the week so you too can get a four thousand dollar computer with one terabyte of storage and I think
[4790.32 → 4800.00] it's a 20 core CPU and 64 gigs of ram so that's pretty cool for four thousand dollars that is a pretty
[4800.00 → 4807.20] special CPU the well the GPU is probably the specialist thing I mean NVIDIA and AMD have been
[4807.20 → 4815.60] trying to bolt together two GPUs with the same performance as a much larger GPU forever yeah basically
[4815.60 → 4821.84] forever I mean you could even go back all the way to uh 3dfx who NVIDIA acquired along with their
[4821.84 → 4832.08] together SLI technology yeah and the m1 ultra does this by using a silicon interposer that connects
[4832.08 → 4840.24] across 10 000 plus signals providing two and a half terabytes per second of bandwidth that allows for a
[4840.24 → 4848.96] fusion architecture that is so fast that software will recognize these two discrete chips as one very
[4848.96 → 4856.48] cool which could just completely change the game pun intended what few games you can play on apple
[4856.48 → 4863.52] silicon no seriously though that's so cool though yeah this no it actually is its crazy if you guys
[4863.52 → 4870.88] haven't already uh Ryan smith from anon tech did uh did a good write-up on why this is so mind-blowing
[4870.88 → 4878.24] it didn't include any um one thing that I feel like was missing from it hey Ryan if you're hi one
[4878.24 → 4883.44] one thing I feel was missing was some analysis of previous attempts and how much bandwidth was available
[4883.44 → 4891.12] between GPUs uh so I would have liked to see him talk about how traditional SLI was actually very low
[4891.12 → 4896.00] bandwidth it was basically just for them to synchronize their workload and most of the
[4896.00 → 4902.88] rendering was actually done or most of the workload sharing was done by having each GPU render an
[4902.88 → 4910.16] alternate frame which added stutter because they wouldn't deliver at an even cadence, and it also added
[4910.16 → 4915.84] I mean it mostly added stutter it also added inefficiency because you had to kind of sort of know
[4915.84 → 4920.80] what this GPU's frame is going to be before you could like work on everything so it was never very
[4920.80 → 4927.52] efficient and then stepping it up a tier you've got interfaces like envy link which are oh yeah
[4927.52 → 4931.84] right so because they were both working on essentially their own frames they both had to
[4931.84 → 4936.80] store all data in their own frame buffer you couldn't combine memory then you could step it up a bit and
[4936.80 → 4944.24] you could go to envy link which is high speed enough that the two GPUs can actually pool their video memory
[4944.24 → 4950.24] which is pretty sick, but they still can't just be treated as a single GPU that you can only use
[4950.24 → 4956.16] them together for highly parallel workloads like you know whether it's its mostly non-gaming stuff
[4956.16 → 4961.12] at this oh yeah it's all non-gaming it's like scientific applications which is sweet and there's a lot
[4961.12 → 4967.76] more of that these days but super cool yeah but not applicable to gamers and then you've got apple
[4967.76 → 4976.56] creating this on chip die to die interposer thing that is so freaking fast that you can basically
[4976.56 → 4982.96] treat every functional unit of this GPU as though of these GPUs as though they are just one which is
[4982.96 → 4989.44] absolutely the coolest thing that came out of the entire Apple event because from my point of view the
[4989.44 → 5000.32] mac studio itself is not particularly exciting it's its for thunderbolt four ports is definitely not as good
[5000.32 → 5008.56] from a professional user standpoint as the mac pro with like PCIE slots for actual cards we're going
[5008.56 → 5016.32] back to we're going back to octopus computers why are we doing that 10 gig thought it was over 10 gigs
[5016.32 → 5025.36] great HDMI 2.0 whatever that even means any more it's 2.0 not 2.1 so I'm glad whoever did up these specs for
[5025.36 → 5031.68] us uh it looks like this was Jonathan horst our resident apple uh apple user um so it would be the
[5031.68 → 5040.08] 2.0 level bandwidth it's the big mac I love that thank you for that NATO SD card reader USB ports USB
[5040.08 → 5049.60] a port nice that it's got a couple USB a port at least but the m1 ultra processor is just man apple is
[5049.60 → 5056.72] just flexing on the rest of the industry at this point the chip is so big the performance per watt
[5056.72 → 5064.72] if they're to be believed which so far they haven't been they've been disingenuous but I don't think you
[5064.72 → 5071.20] could say that they outright have lied yeah they haven't been any more disingenuous than like NVIDIA
[5071.20 → 5079.20] or intel um it depends NVIDIA and intel both have periods of extreme transparency and honesty
[5079.20 → 5084.00] like when NVIDIA released frame view basically giving the entire industry access to the same
[5084.00 → 5091.44] tools that they use to yeah, but then they evaluate the products just like completely not at all so
[5091.44 → 5098.24] yeah yeah that's fair well with apple it's perpetual state okay, okay so can we just recognize the glimmers
[5098.24 → 5106.00] of goodness sure okay it's its it's hard for me because I've been personally screwed over by NVIDIA so hard
[5106.00 → 5113.12] so many times that i just i uh yeah anyway on the GPU side of things they said the m1 ultra is
[5113.12 → 5120.88] comparable to a RTX 3090 while consuming 200 watts less power in industry standard benchmarks which is
[5120.88 → 5129.52] yeah just but man crazy, but then we saw what AMD's uh killer approach to dozen did to CPU performance
[5129.52 → 5135.60] back when they launched it all of a sudden I mean obviously the first iteration was not perfect yeah
[5135.60 → 5142.00] but boy especially if you want to talk power consumption that approach looks so good compared
[5142.00 → 5146.64] to what intel is doing right now with alder lake has the performance absolutely it packs
[5147.20 → 5158.72] but it packs heat mm-hmm yeah get it packing heat yeah yeah okay um at the end of the event senior VP of
[5158.72 → 5164.56] hardware engineering john turns mentioned that the mac pro is still yet to be replaced, so this is a
[5164.56 → 5171.68] mid-tier which means that even though Apple Silicon has been in some cases kind of bargain if pricing
[5171.68 → 5181.36] on this bad boy is anything to go by the uh who yeah you come out with a m1 ultra max, and it's like
[5181.36 → 5187.36] four of them together sorry, sorry I misspoke uh prices start at two thousand dollars that's for a
[5187.36 → 5192.64] relatively entry-level unit with 512 gigs of SSD and the ultra model starts at four thousand dollars
[5192.64 → 5200.16] with a one terabyte SSD in other news apple finally has a 27-inch standalone monitor after many years of
[5200.16 → 5205.36] not kind of doing their own monitors so now they've got the Pro Display XDR and the apple studio display
[5205.36 → 5213.36] sixteen hundred dollars I was going to say, but you'd think it was a whole computer yes boom roasted six
[5213.36 → 5230.48] speaker array with spatial audio ultra-wide webcam with centre stage which is actually very cool like keeps you in focus as you're moving around you can get pc stuff like that but a lot of it is kind of a lot of its kind of Fuji there's a cool one we did a sponsored video on that's actually like it moves the whole camera and actually tracks you shockingly well
[5231.92 → 5236.56] oh is that the one you used when you were at your place with Jake yeah yeah I remember seeing that and
[5236.56 → 5240.24] being like whoa this is actually pretty good it's like really impressive yeah okay yeah uh three
[5240.24 → 5246.32] stand options available one can choose a simple tilt stand or vase amount um for four hundred dollars you
[5246.32 → 5255.04] can get tilt and height adjustments an a13 chip uh like is a computer yeah pretty much the heck and the
[5255.04 → 5261.76] NATO texture glass is available for three hundred dollars so that's cool there's an iPhone SE gets an a15 chip
[5261.76 → 5268.40] from the iPhone 13 and 5g uh no millimetre wave, and it's only two by two memo so all right, but that's
[5268.40 → 5274.96] probably fine everything else is unchanged but the camera and battery improvements um that mostly come
[5274.96 → 5281.04] from the chip prices up thirty dollars to 429. Man that's iPhone SE is just like kind of a killer value
[5282.72 → 5288.96] four hundred and thirty bucks not bad and the iPad Air now has a m1 chip like the iPad Pro raising
[5288.96 → 5294.88] everything more questions about whether the iPad Pro has any reason to exist unless you absolutely
[5294.88 → 5299.92] need the much larger screen pricing is now six hundred dollars and other miscellaneous you can
[5299.92 → 5304.72] now get a green iPhone some people use them as uh art tablets I think actually want the bigger screen oh
[5304.72 → 5309.44] yeah yeah but if I said unless you need a bigger screen yeah yeah I think Marquez said it probably best
[5309.44 → 5316.08] he devoted exactly 59 seconds to the new colours of iPhones and did it as a YouTube short uh short that seemed
[5316.08 → 5320.72] appropriate to me yeah uh Apple TV plus has movies and exclusive MLB games man there are so many
[5320.72 → 5325.20] baseball games did you know they play like 160 games in the season or something stupid like that
[5325.20 → 5330.00] they just pack them in yeah it's crazy yeah it's not as like physically demanding as a lot of other
[5330.00 → 5335.68] sports they just slam them in because you don't need as much recovery time I mean except the pitchers
[5335.68 → 5340.48] I'm sure the pitchers get wrecked well they do like they all are, and they won't even pitch
[5340.48 → 5345.04] nine innings like yeah yeah I was being serious when I was saying that but like outside of that it's not
[5345.04 → 5356.88] as yeah in other exciting news artesian builds uh exciting news okay has completely soiled all over
[5356.88 → 5364.56] itself yeah they became infamous in the pc building community when their CEO Noah cats that's right Noah
[5364.56 → 5375.92] cats only dogs oh it's not funny um when their CEO Noah cats denied the streamer KIA Pia a pc that
[5376.64 → 5381.92] she had been drawn for on stream which was illegal by the way you can't just like change the terms of
[5381.92 → 5388.24] your giveaway mid-giveaway, so the story is oh well whatever under 5 000 on all socials if you know what
[5388.24 → 5395.52] forget it let's just re-roll let's re-roll um that's the re-roll and although cats actions sucked
[5395.52 → 5399.36] it is the kind of thing where you'd expect them to just put their tail between their legs for a bit
[5399.36 → 5405.44] and keep cats off camera unfortunately for the 40 to 50 employees that work there
[5406.88 → 5411.12] how have I never heard of these guys, and they have the same number of employees as us
[5411.12 → 5418.08] who is buying artesian build computers they popped off they're not very old if I remember correctly they
[5418.08 → 5426.32] started in like 2018 or 2019 or something um they popped off through just pushing i I think a lot
[5426.32 → 5432.24] of these like affiliate accounts through twitch, and they're very like twitch focused builder I guess
[5432.88 → 5440.80] what yeah they had a place where they built the bulk of their computers which was in the east
[5440.80 → 5447.92] that was run by the former coo i I know this just from watching like Steve's video um it's a great video
[5448.88 → 5455.36] and then the CEO was in the west, and he had a smaller kind of area they did build computers there yeah it
[5455.36 → 5461.52] was mostly these stream computers that they would build them on stream and then give them away but
[5461.52 → 5467.68] they also built some other computers there um and apparently the CEO quit a while back I don't know
[5467.68 → 5474.96] exactly when because of uh clashing differences with Noah cats and apparently the side of the business
[5474.96 → 5481.28] that the CEO was running was allegedly this is all everything here is allegedly yes if
[5481.28 → 5486.88] you want better information probably just watch Steve's video yeah sure um but a lot of this
[5486.88 → 5492.24] is just ripped off from Steve's video anyway to be completely honest hi Steve um but yeah apparently
[5492.24 → 5499.68] that side of the company was run a little bit more you know better um a little better yeah Steve would
[5499.68 → 5507.76] have said it and there's been a fair amount of kind of you know assumptions that from employees
[5507.76 → 5514.00] that worked there and also people trying to look at the company from the outside that Noah cats at kind
[5514.00 → 5519.20] of near the end barely even cared and just wanted to work on the twitch side of things he just wanted
[5519.20 → 5527.44] to like get twitch famous talk to twitch streamers do that type of stuff um pretty rough yeah the company was
[5527.44 → 5534.24] very clearly on its last legs because it's gone now so this week the company's bank accounts were
[5534.24 → 5540.48] frozen with the people in purchasing no longer being able to purchase things after these things
[5540.48 → 5545.12] are bad cats essentially ghosted the company for a couple of days this is all allegedly okay I don't even
[5545.12 → 5550.08] care yeah the company was allegedly investigated for tax fraud their twitter password was allegedly
[5550.08 → 5555.60] changed, so employees couldn't post refunds were allegedly stopped for customers after several days of
[5555.60 → 5560.16] nearly no communication the employees were hit with an email saying that all the financial assets
[5560.16 → 5566.16] are frozen while an outside council performs a reorganization and all employees are suspended
[5566.16 → 5571.84] until further notice I believe that email included a thing saying like hopefully we'll be able to bring
[5571.84 → 5578.40] you back if we figure things out so if you have recently bought an artesian builds pc, and you do not
[5578.40 → 5586.56] have it yet in your hands you need to call your credit card company and get a chargeback now yeah huh
[5587.60 → 5595.04] this is all crazy through all this allegedly cats doesn't seem to grasp that he just caused 50 people
[5595.04 → 5601.28] to lose their jobs and employees feel like he saw the company as more of a cool sandbox instead of like a
[5601.28 → 5606.16] company with real people working for it cool sandbox make him twitch famous to be clear so yeah if viewers of
[5606.16 → 5610.88] the wan show are currently hiring people with pc building experience um maybe kind of reach
[5610.88 → 5617.04] out there might be some there might be some pc system integrator experienced people out there who are
[5617.04 → 5626.64] looking for work uh Steve we got a quote from Steven Burke uh from gamers nexus Steven Burke the thing
[5627.20 → 5632.48] the thing that's really troubling about this one is just how absolutely idiotic the collapse of this company was
[5636.16 → 5641.84] wow uh and this is in the comments of the video an employee allegedly said uh working for this
[5641.84 → 5648.16] company was so rewarding when you weren't talking to Noah or working with Noah so sad that so many
[5648.16 → 5653.20] staff lost their jobs I hope my colleagues can find comfort elsewhere uh Abe Bradshaw
[5653.20 → 5665.76] yeah or Abby I think I don't think it's ape, but yeah yeah really rough um talk about going out in a
[5665.76 → 5672.32] ball of fire yeah that was pretty wild uh Steve talks in his video about like how this was
[5672.32 → 5679.60] terrible but probably fixable by any like reasonable company yeah make a proper apology video yeah find a way
[5679.60 → 5685.04] to kind of fix it says like we're going to spend some time working on making sure that effectively
[5685.04 → 5690.56] this never happened thank you for your feedback we have taken it seriously just give me the computer
[5690.56 → 5698.96] yeah like immediately when this started gaining any momentum you needed to be like that was super stupid
[5698.96 → 5705.84] here's a computer I am so sorry dumb our bad yeah you can revise your giveaway rules going forward
[5705.84 → 5714.48] fine right like i from a business standpoint i also personally do not see the value of
[5715.68 → 5720.16] you know having someone like thousand dollar computers yeah giving away thousand dollar computers
[5720.16 → 5725.36] or multi-thousand dollar computers to people who are not going to generate thousands or multiple
[5725.36 → 5732.80] thousands of dollars in profit because right like at the end of the day marketing has to have some
[5732.80 → 5737.92] kind of return on investment I can understand some of it because they're trying to get all like
[5737.92 → 5742.80] new up-and-coming streamers to start working with them, they're trying to like to buy out all the up-and-coming
[5742.80 → 5747.52] streamers and there's a cost to that yeah, but they try okay they tried to they tried to offer it to
[5747.52 → 5753.92] her the problem is that they should have done it right away yeah like right away problem is jay was on it
[5753.92 → 5759.12] by the time I even knew about this jay already had a computer he had already yeah exactly I was like
[5759.12 → 5765.20] a needy reaction that's fantastic wow and to be honest he just straight up insulted her and like
[5765.20 → 5769.20] made fun of her so she probably just straight up didn't want I actually didn't watch the whole thing
[5769.20 → 5774.08] because it was just kind of painful to watch it's really like stupid oh yeah okay it's its
[5774.08 → 5778.80] well that's fair enough um so like yeah I mean even if they did reach out to her, it's it would be
[5778.80 → 5783.92] something that would be difficult to recover from, but it's I mean it's possible you pull Noah off camera
[5783.92 → 5789.32] for an extended period of time potentially ever yeah, but you just pull him off camera, and you go
[5789.32 → 5795.72] like yeah that was terrible we're working on fixing this whatever I mean people have been making
[5795.72 → 5802.66] apology videos and then recovering from it for years now it's not exactly a new thing um you thank jay i
[5802.66 → 5809.48] mean that would be an interesting way to go yeah like it's cool that the wow that's a next level move
[5809.48 → 5814.00] yeah it's cool the computer industry like has each other's back so much I'm really unhappy that
[5814.00 → 5818.44] this time we were on the wrong side of it but I'm happy to see that, or you like you replace jay's
[5818.44 → 5823.58] computer or something like that you'd be like hey jay, or you know thanks for that
[5823.58 → 5830.08] give this away to your viewers sure yeah something like that you try and turn an l into a w yeah you
[5830.08 → 5836.90] know you could just you take two l's, and you just yeah perfect uh but yeah it's I mean it would
[5836.90 → 5842.20] have been rough but like you don't expect that issue to just delete your entire company of 50
[5842.20 → 5848.02] employees yeah within a week or whatever it was right honestly you know I'm looking at this going
[5848.02 → 5852.92] wow you can make a system builder with that kind of momentum just by having a few people watch you
[5852.92 → 5858.74] build computers on twitch I should make a computer company well maybe you can't, it's kind of the side
[5858.74 → 5865.10] story right because it sounds I mean they weren't able to do business in California they were being
[5865.10 → 5870.74] looked at for tax fraud all this kind of stuff so like the company was on the company was limping
[5870.74 → 5875.74] it might have been better when the coo was there everything I've been finding is that all the all
[5875.74 → 5882.66] the people were much happier with that person um and maybe the company ran more uh what is it
[5882.66 → 5890.52] called flushed when he was around I don't know um but yeah, yeah okay that's another one Steve is
[5890.52 → 5895.42] helping the employees he's getting them all to reach out to him and I believe he's trying to find
[5895.42 → 5900.16] like system integrator companies that are hiring people so he can try to help them get jobs and
[5900.16 → 5907.02] stuff Steve's being really cool about all this um so that's I mean that's awesome and if you are
[5907.02 → 5910.84] watching this, and you're an employee there, and you somehow haven't already heard about that
[5910.84 → 5918.36] uh reach out to Steve and I'm sure you have yeah I'm sure they have as well yeah all right well
[5918.36 → 5927.68] that's uh that's very it's not even unfortunate because it's not fortune that caused this well
[5927.68 → 5932.24] it's unfortunate for the people it's unfortunate for the employees yeah yeah and hopefully they
[5932.24 → 5943.50] they land on their feet oh man here's some big news AMD asks motherboard manufacturers to remove
[5943.50 → 5952.20] overclocking options for the dozen 7 5700 x3d so we've been talking for years about how companies
[5952.20 → 5958.12] aren't your friends so when people have been bringing up like am dare the good guys it's like
[5958.12 → 5964.16] it may be a little more nuanced than that Luke I don't mean it probably is I'm just saying
[5964.16 → 5972.10] I'm just saying this will be the first chip out of AMD with their 3d v cache okay so it's got way
[5972.10 → 5980.56] way more cache than we've seen on AMD CPUs in the past, but it seems like it comes with a bit of a catch
[5980.56 → 5988.28] compared to the regular 5800 x it has lower base and boost clocks the same price tag at launch
[5988.28 → 5994.62] and currently no overclocking so tech power up verified the rumour posted on video cards
[5994.62 → 6003.14] and AMD is refusing to explain why the chip can't overclock uh and I don't believe that they have
[6003.14 → 6009.26] given any indication whether it will be unlocked by the time consumers can actually get
[6009.26 → 6016.04] their hands on these things so basically they sent this note to manufacturers 5800 x 3d
[6016.04 → 6029.64] 8 core 16 thread 100 dash part number 105 watt Alisa uh pi 1206b 1 slash 28 please hide Vermeer x CPU OC
[6029.64 → 6036.06] bios setup options to my knowledge even motherboard manufacturers haven't been given any explanation
[6036.06 → 6045.78] as to yeah why overclocking is blocked, but it seems like this massive 96 megabytes of level 3
[6045.78 → 6053.44] cache probably has something to do with it there has to be there has to be something that AMD is
[6053.44 → 6060.54] trying to protect in this chip by not allowing users to overclock because they've actually been
[6060.54 → 6066.16] pretty cool about overclocking for the most part every dozen's chip has been unlocked there's a bunch
[6066.16 → 6071.14] of people in flipping chat saying AMD bad now that's not what I was trying to say I'm not saying they're bad
[6071.14 → 6077.70] I'm just saying they're not your friend no company is your friend not, not bad they're just
[6077.70 → 6085.30] they're in it to win it and win it is your money not your feelings yeah 100 unless your feelings lead
[6085.30 → 6094.28] you to want to give them your money yes in other news LimeWire is back hey stick to Austria to Austrian
[6094.28 → 6101.94] entrepreneurs bought the rights to LimeWire, and they're launching a new company LimeWire GmbH
[6101.94 → 6107.86] Paul and Julian not going to try to say that last name uh spun up the company they think it'll evoke
[6107.86 → 6114.60] nostalgia for millennials and gen z which I'm sure gen z I don't think so LimeWire was dead by the time we
[6114.60 → 6120.82] were in high school wasn't it I can't imagine gen zero being too nostalgic about LimeWire um but yeah
[6120.82 → 6127.38] like very early high school for me LimeWire was super gone yeah, or you'd like to go over to your
[6127.38 → 6130.88] friend's house who's not very computer savvy, and they'd still have it and their computer would just
[6130.88 → 6135.90] be wrecked because of all the viruses, and it's just like oh okay that's why um like are you sure you
[6135.90 → 6142.34] don't want to use sherry as a or whatever yeah uh the platform will be used
[6142.34 → 6151.94] for nfts attached to music content and artworks using LimeWire you'll be able to create
[6151.94 → 6160.66] buy and trade NFT collectibles with ease you can join a wait list I guess they have a roadmap I guess
[6160.66 → 6168.82] our discussion question written by Nicholas Plough is why does music need NFTs it doesn't because music
[6168.82 → 6175.94] evokes emotion which evokes opening your wallet hey, hey there it is reference horse armour yeah
[6176.82 → 6182.74] very nice we all know what happened to the mustang album we don't want that to happen again I want to
[6182.74 → 6188.90] hear from you guys flow plane chat are there any gen zero in there that have any nostalgia whatsoever for
[6188.90 → 6194.66] LimeWire I seriously don't I'm trying to remember what the order was of like the main
[6195.54 → 6203.70] the main file sharing so it was Napster first obviously then you had Kazan I believe came after
[6203.70 → 6210.74] Napster sort of at the same time and then after yeah sherry as a way like a fork of Kazan or something
[6210.74 → 6218.66] like that if I recall this is all completely from it's been a minute like teenager me's memory um and
[6218.66 → 6226.10] then I thought LimeWire was in there somewhere yeah gen z never used LimeWire yeah I used it but
[6226.10 → 6236.74] it wasn't an emotional experience roasted one person said I do looking I guess gen z started mid
[6236.74 → 6243.78] to late 1990s that's way yeah that's way too late like they would have been actual children yeah at this
[6243.78 → 6249.30] point yeah you must have been pretty young if that was nostalgia I'm borderline gen z millennial and I got
[6249.30 → 6260.10] a lot of viruses as a kid oh man I feel like dealing with viruses is like was much more of a thing back
[6260.10 → 6265.70] then it's funny uh Jaden's like I'm on the edge of millennial don't remember it after elementary school
[6265.70 → 6271.38] which is so funny to me because using your parents' computer wasn't really as much of a thing when I was in
[6271.38 → 6278.82] elementary school oh yeah right like for sure yeah I like I wasn't why I'm sitting here going oh
[6278.82 → 6283.38] well why would an elementary school kid be like allowed on the internet oh okay a lot of my friends
[6283.38 → 6290.26] in elementary school didn't have the internet it wasn't until I'm trying to think like no joke man did
[6290.26 → 6297.14] I have I don't think I had internet when I lived at my dad's place exactly that's my point until 97.
[6297.14 → 6306.42] wow yeah I mean like later elementary school like in grades six it was quite common yeah but i
[6306.42 → 6311.14] specifically remember like grade three grade four like a lot of people didn't have yeah a lot of people
[6311.14 → 6321.06] didn't have the internet crazy all right aging ourselves a little bit oh this is great did you dude
[6321.06 → 6326.66] millennial you haven't heard three doors down kryptonite without hearing all the screeching beeps
[6327.30 → 6332.90] remember when they used to seed corrupted files into the file sharing networks that was so
[6332.90 → 6342.50] awesome boom boom boom the file you're listening to is available on but like Universal Music oh man i
[6342.50 → 6351.38] remember that oh it's so great yeah it's been a long time there was Nutella I never used Nutella
[6351.38 → 6360.34] I don't remember that one at all codependent says holy shrikes supposedly eMule still works oh no
[6361.78 → 6365.94] we should do some uh we should do some I almost said super chats we don't do those in here uh we should
[6365.94 → 6372.34] do some merch messages yeah Gianna says hey Linus and Luke you said you'd like Ltd store to be sort of
[6372.34 → 6377.70] a lifestyle brand besides more plain stealth items what are some lifestyle products you envision for Ltd
[6377.70 → 6384.66] store well I mean the screwdriver backpack yeah there's the women's clothing doesn't I guess that's
[6384.66 → 6390.10] plain that's still clothing yeah uh we have its says stealth and I was like there are no logos we have puzzles
[6390.10 → 6396.66] coming so that's cool like basically we just don't want to be constrained by traditional merch there's
[6396.66 → 6403.70] the I think there's only one right now but the kid products yeah the book yeah it's pretty unique to
[6403.70 → 6408.34] have a book yeah, yeah so we just want to make things we want to make that we think are cool
[6408.90 → 6416.10] yeah Rachel says hey Linus by now I'm sure you've seen the suggestions for Anthony to have a channel
[6416.10 → 6424.82] focused on Linux do you have any plans for that um the problem with so we're getting into like
[6424.82 → 6431.86] business talk now the problem is that if I have one Anthony and that is the number of Anthony's that
[6431.86 → 6437.78] we have here at Linus media group yeah so I've got one Anthony trying to clone, but it's hard we've got
[6437.78 → 6445.86] this chessboard right Anthony's like the queen or the king you've got one of them okay, and so they can
[6445.86 → 6456.34] only do one thing at a time and I could take that Anthony and I could assign him to work on things that
[6457.14 → 6463.70] a million or two million or five million people will watch and learn from him or I could assign him to
[6463.70 → 6471.94] things where 30 000 30 000 or 50 000 people might watch and learn from him and Anthony might really enjoy
[6471.94 → 6479.38] what he's working on but in the interest of the greater good both to us and to the tech community
[6479.38 → 6486.42] should I put the Anthony in front of as many people as possible working on high profile projects or should
[6486.42 → 6494.66] I sideline Anthony into a niche channel that will never grow beyond a certain ceiling so what you're
[6494.66 → 6499.94] saying is we need to get more writers to the end of the board um, and then they become Anthony's
[6502.34 → 6505.62] I don't know if that's what I was saying but I guess it's chill
[6508.26 → 6512.58] that's where that's where I'm at on it that's where that's where I'm out on if it's uh Anthony is great
[6513.22 → 6522.66] but I think that uh a channel focused on Linux has a ceiling and I think that it's also a community that's pretty well served like why are we why are we going in and trying to
[6522.66 → 6529.22] to take over someone else's there's like almost a disproportionately large amount of Linux creators
[6529.22 → 6534.98] yeah, so there 's's a lot of content out there with mac for example we saw a unique opportunity for
[6534.98 → 6546.10] ourselves as sort of the not but kiss apple coverage right and but that still you know we
[6546.10 → 6551.46] want hosts, and we want writers that do love the products and love the ecosystem but are not
[6551.46 → 6556.90] constrained in any way by having to have a relationship with apple we will just buy horsed
[6556.90 → 6562.50] anything that he needs so he never has to worry about that so we're untethered in that way which
[6562.50 → 6567.86] is cool and I saw that as a differentiating factor but for the Linux one i just don't see what it
[6567.86 → 6573.78] would be uh so it goes I feel like Anthony could work on a Linux video once or twice a month do you have
[6573.78 → 6581.22] any idea how long it takes to make a video once or twice a month would be like 40 of his output
[6582.42 → 6591.78] especially if it's twice in a month like no, no no, no no, no uh Kushal been watching since USB sticks
[6591.78 → 6597.06] killed servers and that guy was called slick if you could bring back one failed product or company
[6597.06 → 6604.26] but make it successful what would it be oh man I want to say engage
[6607.14 → 6611.86] I wish and I wish Nintendo had a competitor in the mobile gaming space all these years
[6613.70 → 6619.14] case labs a case labs would be pretty cool no they're not back someone bought the name but I think
[6619.14 → 6623.46] it's like not back yet yeah and I don't know if it will be what it was
[6626.26 → 6631.62] what else is what else has failed I can't think of a ton, but my knee-jerk was case labs but I can't
[6632.26 → 6637.70] I'm trying to think of things that have failed that I actually liked a cork says June yeah yeah oh
[6638.58 → 6642.82] June software was awesome yeah that's fair June software was so legit
[6642.82 → 6648.58] I wouldn't want to zoom right now to be honest but June software on my phone could be interesting
[6648.58 → 6657.14] la saga says vita yeah vita would be very legit man what a missed opportunity that was
[6657.14 → 6661.30] for them to just make June the primo streaming platform oh yeah people would have people would
[6661.30 → 6667.06] have installed the crap out of that so for sure man Microsoft for a company that is so big and so
[6667.06 → 6675.30] successful so many balls like man yeah if you ever wanted to sell out on NFTs you could always NFT
[6675.30 → 6680.10] the early badges on the forum that's hilarious I didn't really think about that we kind of did an
[6680.10 → 6686.82] NFT sale when we did the contributor badges on the forum how was that NFT well it's like people just
[6686.82 → 6692.90] buying the rights to use an image that anyone could copy as like um a badge on their user
[6692.90 → 6698.42] account no well no I know it's not a NFT I just mean it's your just buying digital how it works
[6698.42 → 6703.22] no oh that's true it's because it's a function on the site you actually cannot just put it there yes
[6704.18 → 6708.10] but okay we don't care if people download the image that wasn't that wasn't the point but
[6709.38 → 6715.78] hold on NFTs if you set them as your profile picture on Twitter do actually integrate with the
[6715.78 → 6721.06] platform it's not a profile picture what is if it's not a user intractable area of the website
[6721.06 → 6728.10] it's an award that you get oh you are splitting hairs I don't think I am I actually completely
[6728.10 → 6733.94] disagree this is not no user can just do this you can't like because on okay so you get a
[6733.94 → 6737.70] hexagon around it and everyone makes fun of you because you have a hexagon picture on your twitter
[6737.70 → 6742.82] profile so whatever that's the only difference on there you get a hexagon, or you don't but no one
[6742.82 → 6747.06] gives a crap, and they just make fun of you if you have it on the forum it's its a non-user
[6747.06 → 6752.82] intractable section it's a badge holder area you can't add things there you can't subtract things
[6752.82 → 6755.86] from there they're just there if you've earned them or purchased them
[6758.90 → 6765.94] I think it's got a pretty similar vibe you're buying digital artwork you're not though well you
[6765.94 → 6771.14] kind of are no you're not well you're okay you're buying rep like you're you're buying you're flexing
[6771.14 → 6777.14] yes by buying an image 100 yeah then it's the same thing, but you're buying you're buying an award
[6777.14 → 6784.66] the image part doesn't matter the image part was actually so bad that remember we drew some of them
[6784.66 → 6790.42] in paint and tried to make them intentionally bad wow the chat is very divided on this
[6790.42 → 6800.26] wow some of it was artwork oleic I mean some artists created it and also uh I did some hand
[6800.26 → 6808.26] drawn ones that were very expensive, and they were intentionally awful um, and it's just one of them
[6810.10 → 6816.66] but yes but theoretically a NFT is just one but anyone can download it, and we knew that from the
[6816.66 → 6821.54] start but no one else can add it as their badge on their profile that's true Ryan Carson points out
[6821.54 → 6829.22] that it can't be resold yeah so it's worse than a NFT yeah sure I don't know I'm just saying it's
[6829.22 → 6835.06] not a NFT that that's like that's like saying skins and video games are NFTs it's like no I think they
[6835.06 → 6839.78] are certainly precursors that's why I keep bringing up horse armour every time we talk about it because
[6839.78 → 6848.34] it's paying actual real actual money for intangible pixels, but it's its a lot of NFTs even though they
[6848.34 → 6853.78] they don't have exclusivity built into it at all because you can just mint more of them like it's
[6853.78 → 6859.06] literally part of the whole idea there's literally artists that have just minted like 50 of one photo
[6859.06 → 6865.22] and they've been like whatever um they come with an assumption of exclusivity game skins do not
[6865.22 → 6870.10] it's just a thing that you buy it's an art attribution that you buy that has nothing to
[6870.10 → 6874.98] do with NFTs right but in the same so game skins whether we're talking game skins or whether we're
[6874.98 → 6880.10] talking a badge on the forum the scarcity is determined by the provider you can't just say
[6880.10 → 6886.34] anything in the world that has a scarcity element to it is a NFT no but I'm not saying it is a NFT
[6886.34 → 6892.18] I'm saying it's a very like one okay we're going to let the community decide I think Luke and I have both
[6892.18 → 6896.42] had an opportunity to make our cases here this drop hole actually gonna work this time I don't know
[6896.42 → 6901.06] it's been pretty broken lately so I've dropped it in the float plane chat I've dropped it in the twitch
[6901.06 → 6906.82] chat against my better judgment because those are all the talks because AF JK love you twitch chat and
[6906.82 → 6912.18] I'm dropping it in YouTube now which moves so fast that I can't even no one's going to be able to click on
[6912.18 → 6920.74] it i have to wonder you know YouTube chat what's up we don't talk much but um the reason is that it moves
[6920.74 → 6928.58] so fast that there can't possibly be any meaningful interaction in it so why do you guys bother you type
[6928.58 → 6934.58] yeah it's i I saw an interesting conversation about it because we're it was like a comparison of a bunch
[6934.58 → 6941.78] of different streaming tools and like um the value of slowness was part of the conversation and twitch chat
[6942.18 → 6948.42] there's just as much interaction in twitch chat but twitch chat loads in like chunks so
[6948.42 → 6953.38] you'll see a bunch of messages and then it'll go and it'll take off but then you'll see they'll sit
[6953.38 → 6958.90] there for a sec yeah you'll be able to read them and then they'll take off again and then YouTube is
[6958.90 → 6965.14] a continuous thing it's actually much faster which makes it unreadable so it's almost good that the
[6965.14 → 6970.50] twitch version is slower because you can actually interact with it even though it's so fast well three
[6970.50 → 6975.22] quarters of the community agrees with you but I realize i actually kind of phrased the question
[6975.22 → 6980.02] you put the put the question wrong yeah i kind of asked wrong I'm going to take this w anyway
[6981.94 → 6992.02] well you're welcome but you yeah you just you said it wrong all right um fine I'm over it
[6992.02 → 6999.62] back to merch messages I should just I should just sell out and sell NFTs no I should just sell out
[6999.62 → 7007.30] and then buy a Hawaiian island you should just you should get like one of the crater
[7007.30 → 7013.38] where I warehouse people to draw like a poo and then sell it for like a million dollars well that's
[7013.38 → 7020.98] exactly it is'd be hilarious if someone actually buys it does it make it better if you openly mock
[7020.98 → 7026.90] it and sell it i we decided I think we talked about this before and we decided no, no it doesn't make it
[7026.90 → 7033.94] any better because you are still cynically taking advantage of someone else's belief that it will
[7033.94 → 7039.38] appreciate in value someone will end up holding that bag and that bag is full of turds
[7039.38 → 7048.58] oh that that's a NFT collection that I don't think has been made yet bag of turds yeah and each bag is
[7048.58 → 7055.86] like unique so when you buy it you get a picture of what kind of turds were inside it
[7059.62 → 7068.74] oh boy that's rough yeah all right back to it from uh Brayden love the show currently looking for a
[7068.74 → 7075.30] new mouse my old MX vertical broke and I wanted a better mouse for gaming preferably ergonomic any
[7075.30 → 7086.18] recommendations oh boy um Brayden if you liked the MX vertical um I don't know what to recommend you
[7086.18 → 7093.06] because I definitely did not jibe with the MX vertical it's a weird mouse it's a weird mouse can I
[7093.06 → 7098.66] show your screen uh yeah sure here one sec oh I already did it no it's fine okay it's just loading
[7098.66 → 7105.46] there we go yeah that's the vertical so suggesting a different mouse than the vertical is like
[7106.98 → 7113.70] kind of tough yeah thanks for writing into the show though but I just don't even know
[7113.70 → 7120.82] where to begin you're showing yours whoops wrong screen uh Robert why do screens have a minimum
[7120.82 → 7125.70] brightness I get the max but why can't I turn it all the way down to zero percent that is a wonderful
[7125.70 → 7133.78] question and it has to do with the way that screen brightness is modulated so whether it's PWM modulation
[7133.78 → 7140.42] which used to be more common on earlier CDs and was good because it allowed you to effectively go
[7140.42 → 7150.34] down to zero brightness just by pulsing the um the power to the backlight more or less often um but
[7150.34 → 7157.38] had the drawback of flickering uh and strobing like it was annoying and could give people uh
[7158.42 → 7165.86] mild side effects like headaches or whatever the case may be so now we use DC modulation or and it's not
[7165.86 → 7172.18] really modulation at that point we use DC control so we adjust the voltage being provided and the reason
[7172.18 → 7179.06] that you can't just keep taking the voltage down to zero is that electronics have a minimum voltage that
[7179.06 → 7187.78] is required for them to run now I would love to see some innovation um around something like um
[7187.78 → 7196.58] uh ND filters for example oh like interesting so we have uh lenses for example in the studio where
[7196.58 → 7204.10] there 's's two ND filters that you can uh counter rotate to allow more or less light to pass through
[7204.10 → 7210.98] and they are mostly transparent in terms of not, not colouring the light that passes through them, I think
[7210.98 → 7217.14] something like that would be an amazing way to achieve uh lower light output but maybe that's just
[7217.14 → 7222.90] something that could be an accessory for a product like uh like a portable handheld gaming system or
[7222.90 → 7228.26] or something along those lines but the reality of it is you just can't turn the voltage lower and
[7228.26 → 7233.38] lower and lower because eventually you just won't be able to drive the screen off yeah yeah
[7235.62 → 7241.54] uh next one was from kyle he said would you ever consider doing a collab with the guys at NASA space flight
[7241.54 → 7248.26] it'd be super cool to see the camera robotics and networking they've developed uh and use for rocket
[7248.26 → 7254.50] launch tracking and live streams uh maybe petabyte build for them too yeah we actually have a contact
[7254.50 → 7261.06] of the Canadian space agency now do we really yeah he reached out saying like I can't join full-time but
[7261.06 → 7270.26] we would be interested in like consulting or helping with labs interesting um so I mean that could be cool
[7270.26 → 7276.18] yeah that's super cool I mean we yeah we're down to collab um it's I think you guys
[7277.54 → 7284.74] overestimate the simplicity of making a video about science stuff like that yeah it's kind of a
[7284.74 → 7292.42] challenging thing to make engaging to an average viewer, and we're at a point where LTT can't upload a video
[7292.42 → 7298.74] that only appeals to a hundred thousand people that is not sustainable for our company everything we upload
[7298.74 → 7305.38] has to at least appeal to a million people so whenever we do something that's like holy crap look
[7305.38 → 7315.78] at this thing there has to be enough that is relatable to our um to our consumer our predominantly
[7315.78 → 7323.70] consumer audience if you were able to check out like the control centre at Houston I think that might
[7323.70 → 7329.22] be transferable enough yeah you but okay the problem with that is that you'd have to have
[7329.22 → 7334.66] complete enough access to it oh yeah that you're able to make a compelling video which might not be
[7334.66 → 7340.18] possible if they came in, and they were just like you get a standard tour here's this room what does that
[7340.18 → 7345.86] do that's classified yeah what does that do classified that's not a video there's no video agree so that's
[7345.86 → 7354.02] one of the that's one of the ground rules that we have anytime someone brings us in to do a piece of
[7354.02 → 7358.58] content about something that's more industrial or more enterprise is we basically go okay look it's
[7358.58 → 7364.90] going to have to be unfettered if I ask you to pull up your uh you know your raised cable management
[7364.90 → 7370.90] floor you say how high how many tiles do you want removed if I say I want to crawl around in it, you say
[7370.90 → 7378.66] when will that be like it's we have to be able to come in and do our jobs did I ever tell you about
[7378.66 → 7385.62] uh remember when I went to you probably don't um but I went to IEM intel extreme masters yes I do
[7385.62 → 7391.06] remember that and wasn't that where you beat up that girl in like Mario Kart no that was pax
[7391.06 → 7397.22] no that was a specific Nintendo event was it yeah all right yeah he's an awful person i really
[7397.22 → 7405.70] ugh people I'm not going to go over that story but um uh no we were able to go backstage and we
[7405.70 → 7411.70] wanted we were going to make a video of the like oh that's right of the big like uh video wall or
[7411.70 → 7417.94] whatever or like uh some display or networking it was the control centre how they manage all the
[7417.94 → 7422.74] incoming streams and how they like mix it all together to send it out right, and we made a video
[7422.74 → 7430.50] back there and what what is it yes ESA or something the sea I'm not sure yes yeah the
[7430.50 → 7434.66] company that like runs the I think it's sea yes yeah
[7437.78 → 7442.42] oh I think it was I don't remember the company that was running the tournament yeah um
[7442.42 → 7451.86] they saw the video go up we're like what because intel was like yeah sure that's fine and then just
[7451.86 → 7457.94] got us back there and then none of the people that were there were like this is a problem because i
[7457.94 → 7462.90] was clearly being escorted by intel people so they were like I don't know but the people that actually
[7462.90 → 7468.58] owned that section which was not intel were like huh, and it ended up all being totally fine right
[7469.22 → 7475.78] uh, but there can be very sensitive information right yeah and um foster pay go over on twitch chat
[7475.78 → 7482.90] says that's right I agree but Linus uh put it in a way that sounded pretty bossy well yeah I did
[7482.90 → 7491.06] because if you expect me to come in and do my job which is to make your thing be interesting I think it
[7491.06 → 7498.18] was how high part well got a little that's the answer don't tell me how to do my job I've been doing
[7498.18 → 7505.86] it is longer than you that's the reality of it and so if your goal is to have me come in yeah, thanks uh if
[7505.86 → 7512.10] your goal is to have me come in and make an interesting video then you have to facilitate it
[7512.10 → 7518.02] it can't, it can't, you can't be blocking me we're on the same team is pretty much what I'm trying to
[7518.02 → 7524.74] say and I potentially be certain things, but if there needs to like I'm reasonable yeah obviously yeah but
[7524.74 → 7529.62] that's the reason that I specifically said that this is really challenging when it comes to
[7529.62 → 7537.62] industrial or enterprise applications because it's not immediately relatable like making a video
[7537.62 → 7547.14] about say for example an enterprise storage appliance okay making that interesting to a million people
[7547.14 → 7553.46] or two million people is not simple, and it's not something that's necessarily intuitive to the kinds of
[7553.46 → 7559.30] people that work in PR or corporate communications for a company that produces a product like that
[7559.30 → 7564.34] especially if you can like only look at it from the outside or something exactly so if I show up and
[7564.34 → 7570.34] I'm like hey I want to see the backplate, and they're like no sorry and I go okay I need to open the chassis
[7570.34 → 7576.18] and they're like no and i kind of go well I need to see the cooling system, and they go sorry we can't show
[7576.18 → 7582.26] you that right then you're basically asking me to come and do my job while you put up obstacles that
[7582.26 → 7586.82] prevent me from doing my job yeah right so they just want a bad advertisement at that point but
[7586.82 → 7592.66] they don't even realize it would be bad and that's it so they just want an advertisement it's like no
[7592.66 → 7599.94] it has to be interesting exactly, exactly there's nothing that grinds my gears more than someone who
[7599.94 → 7606.50] expects me to come in and produce an ad for them like no this is a give and take relationship
[7606.50 → 7616.26] I need content you want content let's work together is the point that I was trying to make
[7616.26 → 7624.34] and so when it comes okay hp had a sand years ago right so when it comes to creating obstacles for me no
[7624.34 → 7632.66] I don't tolerate it I just won't go I'll say look these are the terms you have to you have to be open with
[7632.66 → 7640.02] us you have to give us access we have to be able to climb up on a thing if that's what we need for an
[7640.02 → 7646.58] interesting shot you got to accept that and if you don't then have someone else do your corporate
[7646.58 → 7652.58] tour video and no one will watch it because there's a reason people watch what we do, and they don't watch
[7652.58 → 7658.74] that because that's boring yeah I'm not going to go in and make not boring content because I can't upload that
[7658.74 → 7670.10] that's the way it is yeah uh we've got some more merch messages here Jason says my 11-year-old wants
[7670.10 → 7675.70] to create YouTube videos any recommendations on where to start gear applications etc your phone
[7675.70 → 7683.70] your phone and some free or cheap video editing software on your phone because the first
[7683.70 → 7688.18] thing any 11-year-old needs to figure out is if they're actually passionate about this or if they're
[7688.18 → 7693.46] going to do it one time and forget about it not even that there 's's extremely successful
[7694.10 → 7700.34] many million views per video many million subscriber channels that work exclusively off of iPhones like
[7700.34 → 7705.94] straight up robin 5693 asks Linus what if there's a safety reason you're not allowed like a radiation area
[7705.94 → 7712.18] then the next thing I'll say is okay I want to see the control centre for the radiation control system
[7712.18 → 7716.34] or something or something yeah you have to give me something like you said
[7717.30 → 7724.90] to be reasonable it's a visual medium right and uh Negev says um oh wait why was Luke escorted by intel
[7724.90 → 7729.54] people because you just are when you're in a restricted area you need an escort that's normal
[7729.54 → 7736.90] like it's not it's not that we don't understand how the world works it's just that a lot of the time the
[7736.90 → 7741.70] people working in these jobs don't understand how content works they don't do it day to day they
[7741.70 → 7746.10] don't get it they watch the video, and they go wow that's a lot of views and a lot of the times they
[7746.10 → 7752.90] just haven't even watched any of our actual content like I've shown up, and they didn't realize that i
[7752.90 → 7757.78] was going to start taking things apart and I go well did you even know who I am why did you even call me
[7758.90 → 7764.98] you know what are which is fine I don't expect everyone to know who I am it's just that if you went to the
[7764.98 → 7774.10] trouble to fly me here I figured you might that's all yeah um Nathaniel are there any videos you
[7774.10 → 7782.34] regret making e.g. ASMR build guide well that's certainly one of them uh I regret that wan show where
[7782.34 → 7789.14] I was like crypto will never be a thing it's going nowhere when the guy bought the house oh there's
[7789.14 → 7794.18] a lot of takes on wan show that I'm sure yeah for sure I'm sure there are a lot of takes on wan show
[7794.18 → 7798.66] that we probably regret and there are a lot of takes on wan show that also like end up ended becoming
[7798.66 → 7808.82] like prophetic statements um I don't know who knows videos you regret making man that WD sponsorship at
[7808.82 → 7815.38] computer that first year was pretty rough yeah so we inked a deal with it's all people who aren't there
[7815.38 → 7820.18] anymore so I feel like I can tell this story, but we inked a deal with our WD rep man where we ever we
[7820.18 → 7826.74] were scrappy we were desperate back then the deal was they would be our sponsor for computer
[7827.54 → 7835.30] but on every day of the show we had to make a separate individual video from the WD booth
[7836.66 → 7844.26] and there was like getting one video out of the WD booth that year would have been a struggle been really
[7844.26 → 7851.86] tough I remember because that that was the that was the first show that I did kind of on my own in
[7851.86 → 7858.10] regards to hosting stuff and I remember like feeling kind of cheese because you just dumped all the trash
[7858.10 → 7865.62] on me um that's but yes but then I also remember feeling so stoked because I didn't have to do any of the
[7865.62 → 7872.26] WD videos all the WD stuff it was like so time-consuming because they always wanted to bring
[7872.26 → 7877.78] some director or VP to talk to me about stuff Brandon and I would cruise by you guys see you're
[7877.78 → 7883.54] doing something go film a whole video cruise back, and you had like not progressed very far and I knew
[7883.54 → 7889.86] you were faster and more efficient than me so I'm just like oh my goodness this must be really rough
[7889.86 → 7900.34] I made an entire video this is amazing I made an entire video about the stupid hard drive inspired
[7900.90 → 7906.26] car that they had in the booth what didn't you specifically have to make that one too yes you
[7906.26 → 7912.82] had to make it about the car yeah I wanted to just integrate the car into like other thing else yeah
[7912.82 → 7917.22] content I remember you specifically telling me that you had to make a dedicated video just about the car
[7917.22 → 7928.18] and I was just like what oh no like it was kind of neat in that it's all like uh inspired by actual
[7928.18 → 7936.34] hard drive components like these are uh the actuator arms and stuff like that so it's like neat but man
[7936.98 → 7944.02] some of the like art projects that get made for shows there were not five videos worth of things in
[7944.02 → 7953.86] that oh six hold on how long were there six days holy crap yeah um
[7955.38 → 7962.66] there okay oh this reminds me of something we uh we regretted making so much that we never made it
[7962.66 → 7974.50] public so oh, oh no okay are you sure you even want to go over that you guys are oh no so oh no one of the
[7974.50 → 7984.66] one of the like industry computer traditions for better or for worse I'm using the word better very
[7984.66 → 7993.06] charitably here not better um is it's a bit of a different culture over there I guess i
[7993.06 → 7998.26] would say I mean this used to be a thing in at western shows as well oh for sure I mean it's still
[7998.26 → 8003.78] a thing depending on what western show you go to that's probably fair like I went to a car show not
[8003.78 → 8008.66] that long I'm sure still thinking car show booth babes were definitely still a thing to use the i
[8008.66 → 8013.46] i in my opinion slightly derogatory term but I need you guys to understand what I'm talking about
[8013.46 → 8019.22] and that's the only word i really generally referred the only really word I really know for it um but
[8019.22 → 8027.70] we were like oh okay should we do like a booth compilation that includes like the the
[8027.70 → 8032.26] the presenters at each booth because it's pretty typical at computer for them to have people that
[8032.26 → 8039.38] obviously don't work at these companies that in some cases are definitely not wearing enough clothing
[8039.38 → 8048.34] and we were just like many this is the clingiest thing ever, and it doesn't matter if this is a thing
[8048.34 → 8053.78] that everyone do we're just not going to participate in this was what we ultimately decided and I'm
[8053.78 → 8061.86] extremely glad that we never uploaded that yeah like extremely glad I could not be more
[8061.86 → 8068.26] glad that that did not happen it was just it would have been one of the yeah go ahead computer
[8068.26 → 8073.22] was the only one because again there was there were booth babes or however you refer to them, i genuinely
[8073.22 → 8080.82] don't know if there's another name for it, I don't know um CES it was pretty big there there were summit packs
[8080.82 → 8087.94] but it was not very big there um but at computex was the only show that I knew photographers went there
[8088.50 → 8094.42] purely to take photos of them yeah not to cover anything to do with the show other than the
[8094.42 → 8098.82] the booth babes and that was like a big what the heck moment for me
[8105.54 → 8112.26] time for our next uh merch message Jason when you released the stealth pins shirt you did a golden
[8112.26 → 8116.98] ticket design for something like five shirts what was the design and what did the prize end up being done
[8116.98 → 8122.42] everyone claim the prize model okay sure uh promotional model thank you that is the that is
[8122.42 → 8129.46] the pc term yeah uh what was the design what did we do it said something else on it what was it sorry
[8129.46 → 8136.02] oh, oh I think we gave away CPUs it was the CPU uh stealth pins shirt and I think there were different
[8136.02 → 8144.98] letters in it or something or the pin yeah like because it's LTT it spells out LTT kind of subtly yeah on the
[8144.98 → 8152.58] normal ones, and it was something else for the special ones um and I believe everyone claimed
[8152.58 → 8158.02] them, but that's a question for nick I said here's your budget to do a giveaway, and then it was off my
[8158.02 → 8163.30] desk anonymous asks how easy was it to swap out the SSD in the steam deck actually pretty easy
[8163.94 → 8169.62] uh we haven't upgraded our steam deck SSDs yet though but we will soon it valve has perfect guides for
[8169.62 → 8178.34] how to do a fresh installation on it so it's no big deal uh Aiden next question uh from Aiden is would
[8178.34 → 8182.98] you consider doing a what's in my bag video with the release of the LTT backpack what if that was
[8182.98 → 8188.26] we were talking today I didn't end up being able to have that meeting with nick uh for other reasons
[8188.26 → 8192.42] but we were talking today about like how we could make the product pages unique and I mentioned videos
[8192.42 → 8197.14] what if that was the video for the backpack yeah like a tour through the backpack with your stuff in it
[8197.14 → 8201.70] but that could just be a channel upload I think that the one on the product page should actually be
[8201.70 → 8209.78] we're talking about doing maybe for the first time ever pre-orders on a product and uh screwdriver
[8209.78 → 8216.26] and backpack are obvious candidates for it because they've been such cash sinks, and so we're thinking
[8216.26 → 8222.66] about uh doing like special content for the page and um Luke came up with the idea of doing like product
[8222.66 → 8229.22] tours of the prototypes uh kind of like a kickstarter video but actually i I'm kind of imagining it with
[8229.22 → 8235.14] like really crappy production values just like me in a room you might even film if it's like the
[8235.14 → 8245.46] cameraman sweet um we'll just show it off yeah uh yeah so yes we would consider that yeah absolutely I don't
[8245.46 → 8250.10] think what's in my bag is very interesting though I have a pretty boring bag I like the little
[8250.10 → 8254.90] the little pouch yeah but I showed the pouch recently oh okay yeah like I just talked about
[8254.90 → 8260.10] it in I think uh a stream uh the steam deck disassembly stream I think I did it right Julian
[8260.10 → 8264.98] l uh just out of curiosity would you ever be doing interested in doing a LTT video on the tech behind
[8264.98 → 8269.06] tubers and try turning yourself into one yeah I think it'd be fascinating it is pretty
[8269.06 → 8273.46] interesting and I think from a business standpoint it would actually make a ton of sense to get into it
[8273.46 → 8281.14] it's really advanced stuff like it's actually really cool I don't know one any chance of products
[8281.14 → 8288.26] making their way back onto Amazon or was that a one-off yes they're supposed to in all seriousness
[8288.26 → 8294.50] though the creator warehouse team is super busy we have a new uh we have a new like logistics
[8294.50 → 8299.22] person, and she hopefully is going to do a way better job of smoothing out our ordering
[8299.22 → 8307.30] so really excited about that cool, but it's going to take time yeah and our restocks right uh Zachary
[8307.30 → 8312.66] hey thanks for making night shift great hey heck yeah Zachary another water bottle for the collection
[8312.66 → 8317.06] any tips for a small tech content creator I mean it's the same thing I tell everyone right like
[8317.62 → 8323.06] you have to find you have to find your own voice you have to find something that you are really passionate
[8323.06 → 8328.98] about i think the way the met is going now is it's less about trying to
[8328.98 → 8338.50] be a huge um do everything creator and more about finding a niche and absolutely killing it like
[8338.50 → 8347.94] Vincent from HDTV test for example just gets so far into the weeds on TV and panel technology that
[8351.86 → 8358.90] he puts himself in a position where he can get big enough in that niche that if he decided to branch out
[8358.90 → 8364.74] he's got this captive audience and I think that's the best way to gain a foothold these days versus
[8364.74 → 8370.34] just trying to be another tech YouTuber people like passion so if you're super passionate and
[8370.34 → 8374.74] super knowledgeable about one particular thing just run with that thing super hard like Linus was saying
[8375.62 → 8380.18] hey Larson Luke now that most online computer parts places are kind of shady can we trust pc part
[8380.18 → 8385.46] picker and tiger direct for our pc parts ordering didn't tiger directly I didn't know they existed
[8385.46 → 8391.70] anymore go down at some point are they still a thing holy crap they're still a thing whoa march mayhem
[8391.70 → 8400.34] hot picks this is so city basketball has something to do with computers uh wow
[8401.86 → 8404.74] 3.89 dell i5 14-inch laptop
[8407.22 → 8413.22] wow um yeah I don't really know what to tell you about that who knows
[8413.22 → 8419.46] um we don't vet computer shops yeah pc part picker I don't think actually sells anything
[8419.46 → 8423.38] directly I think they did yeah I don't I've heard very good things about me or uh
[8426.34 → 8432.82] what are they called micro centre yes micro centre yeah yeah we haven't seen too many complaints about
[8432.82 → 8437.46] micro centre so that's always I mean that's really the only gauge we have because we don't have personal
[8437.46 → 8444.58] experience sorting from any of these us only sites yep and I think that's the end thank you guys very
[8444.58 → 8463.70] much for tuning into the wan show we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
