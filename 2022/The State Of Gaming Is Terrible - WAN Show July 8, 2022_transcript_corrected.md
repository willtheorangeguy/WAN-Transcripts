[0.00 → 8.60] welcome to the wan show we have a fantastic show lined up for you guys today with hot topics
[8.60 → 17.54] including ubisoft they went so long without us having anything too negative to say about them
[17.54 → 22.64] the whole NFT thing okay that was pretty bad well anyway it's even worse this week they're
[22.64 → 29.20] decommissioning online services for a number of their old games with no alternatives to be seen
[29.20 → 35.72] we'll be talking about that alongside just I mean I guess just the state of gaming in general you can't
[35.72 → 41.50] talk about games getting decommissioned without also talking about how much it costs to pay for
[41.50 → 51.78] these gaming experiences that are so, so fleeting uh in other news an m.2 MacBook Pro teardown confirms
[51.78 → 58.76] it is basically a m1 did I say m.2 you did a m2 MacBook Pro teardown confirms it's
[58.76 → 67.90] basically a m1 except you if you wanted to uh oh I don't know just reuse that chassis and change
[67.90 → 73.32] the logic board so we'll be talking a little bit more about that later uh YouTube is just randomly
[73.32 → 79.14] deciding that definitely adult content is actually for kids, and it's flagging it for kids, and it's
[79.14 → 87.42] giving it to kids so that's bad also NVIDIA is unable to back out of TSMC orders because actually
[87.42 → 94.66] yes your sales numbers were inflated by mining yes they were uh yes they were oh and I'm going to have
[94.66 → 102.10] an update on the whole YouTube spam comment situation i have been personally contacted by
[102.10 → 108.62] more than one YouTube employee about my comments from last week so we'll be chatting about that as well
[108.62 → 109.34] interesting
[109.34 → 137.12] the show is brought to you today by graphic Zoho desk and vulture why don't we jump right into our
[137.12 → 144.56] first topic this was actually flagged for me by a viewer unfortunately I'm sorry i i I didn't save
[144.56 → 149.76] your tweet and i I forget which one it was but thank you they asked me whether I play Anna 2070 because
[149.76 → 157.68] that's one of the games that Ubisoft is decommissioning the online services for uh here's uh here's a quote
[157.68 → 164.24] here closing the online services for some older games allows us to focus our services on delivering
[164.24 → 169.90] great experiences for players who are playing newer or more popular titles and some of the ones that
[169.90 → 177.54] are being booted include Anna 2070 assassins creed 2 3 brotherhood liberation HD and revelations
[177.54 → 183.90] Far Cry 3 and space junkies it's a lot more than that too it is a lot more than that do you want to
[183.90 → 190.30] actually pull up oh yes this topic definitely needs a look at the Ubisoft website because the
[190.30 → 195.26] notes are not I've got it um but yeah you can kind of scroll through the games I think you listed a
[195.26 → 199.16] lot of these first ones and there's driver San Francisco ghost Brecon future soldier prince of
[199.16 → 207.46] Persia forgotten sands for them right now etc, etc now we did some we did some pre-show digging
[207.46 → 214.00] we looked through some stuff there are some oddities in here uh I think what Ubisoft is really trying to
[214.00 → 219.38] communicate to people is that their own platforms are absolutely the worst and if you ever want to play
[219.38 → 225.14] an Ubisoft game you should play it anywhere else ever or just don't play an Ubisoft game um the
[225.14 → 230.60] reason for that as you can dive through here and see all of this if you scroll down to
[230.60 → 236.52] splinter cell blacklist there's something fascinating if you look at what happens to pc it
[236.52 → 243.30] says you are unable to play multiplayer link Ubisoft accounts in game or use online services if you look at
[243.30 → 248.90] splinter cell blacklist for console blacklist for console it doesn't say you can't play multiplayer
[248.90 → 255.52] that is a consistent theme throughout pretty much all of this if the multiplayer is handled by
[255.52 → 265.10] consoles it's fine if it's handled by you play you can't do it anymore and that is trash and literally
[265.10 → 269.92] just means you're bad so stop doing it start putting your games on like steam or something and
[269.92 → 275.32] if you're going to decor something decor you play because it's garbage you are the worst one out of all
[275.32 → 281.64] of them give up worse than origin yes okay all right I mean what's what's what's what's what does
[281.64 → 287.84] you play do better than origin well download rates are faster on origin's actually stable I don't
[287.84 → 297.94] thin kea has recommend games off of it origin the platform is better than like Ea games okay let me be
[297.94 → 304.80] let me play devil's advocate here okay, okay if I am Ubisoft and I have specific infrastructure set
[304.80 → 309.84] up to run multiplayer for these games that functionally nobody is playing multiplayer that
[309.84 → 315.80] takes borderline no maintenance but who plays zero server space I'm trying to play devil's advocate
[315.80 → 320.96] you're making it very difficult okay I'm advocating for the devil so you have to at least let me talk
[320.96 → 326.82] okay I have to maintain these online services that are specific to these games to these
[326.82 → 333.28] titles um functionally no one is playing them I mean who is playing assassin's creed 2
[333.28 → 338.76] multiplayer probably no one literally probably nobody is playing assassin's creed 2 I would argue there are
[338.76 → 347.20] alternatives okay can i finish Luke I want to advocate for the devil here okay, okay I have a hard
[347.20 → 353.38] enough job as it is without you interrupting constantly why wouldn't I take those resources
[353.38 → 359.98] and reallocate them as a developer as someone who leads a development team what is pretty much the
[359.98 → 371.80] the worst sorry really, really mature what is literally the worst like anchor that drags back current development
[371.80 → 379.08] uh yeah like just code rot maintenance like that maintenance for sure and are there potential
[379.08 → 385.48] security concerns with having these services running when they are not being maintained probably very
[385.48 → 391.86] minor ones but probably yes probably okay, so devil's advocate is it not in the best interest of the
[391.86 → 398.12] current game player base that they discontinue these services for older games that nobody is playing the
[398.12 → 406.22] best interest that they don't do anything I'm advocating I don't what am I supposed to do I don't
[406.22 → 412.90] think this is an extensive amount of work to be completely honest considering as far as I can tell the console
[412.90 → 420.68] maintainers just don't care at all because like if is Ubisoft and we'll talk about uh not caring at
[420.68 → 425.96] all a little bit more later when we start talking about space junkies specifically uh but if Ubisoft is
[425.96 → 430.14] discontinuing uh discontinuing support for multiplayer you think the consoles would be like oh sweet we
[430.14 → 436.44] get to drop it too as far as I can tell they genuinely don't care because it is such a small amount of
[436.44 → 445.26] work it is so small it takes so little there's even little things like oh the ability to download DLC
[445.26 → 447.96] is being turned off yeah why
[447.96 → 455.32] why that's not a multiplayer feature I can almost understand the multiplayer stuff no I can definitely
[455.32 → 459.36] understand the multiplayer stuff more right there's more maintenance that goes into it there's more of
[459.36 → 463.54] this other kind of stuff this is just a file download okay my devil's advocate hat is off the answer
[463.54 → 471.38] is legislation that makes it so that the user owns the software because the fundamental problem right now
[471.38 → 481.10] is that when you buy a game you are not buying a copy of the game you are buying a license to use the game
[481.10 → 489.92] whatever state it happens to be in and that's the way that the software industry as a whole
[489.92 → 498.08] has managed to slowly but surely push things because it gives them a much greater degree of control if I was
[498.08 → 507.10] someone who was super into Anna 2070 for example and I wanted to play multiplayer Anna darn it my only
[507.10 → 513.88] option now is to either play an older game from back when there were alternate multiplayer options
[513.88 → 520.32] and it is possible I actually don't know I haven't tried multiplayer Anna 2070 it's possible there is a
[520.32 → 525.46] LAN multiplayer although I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't I will say i you and I have to match or
[525.46 → 530.20] something you and I have both played Anna a fair amount at this point I played a lot less than you
[530.20 → 535.08] but still you have exposed to me that the Anna developers seem to be quite beloved by the
[535.08 → 540.88] community yeah they care people like them very not interesting if you know that but I think a lot of
[540.88 → 547.08] people that don't play Anna don't know that um is Ubisoft mains the studio behind Anna are working on
[547.08 → 553.06] upgrading the aged online services infrastructure to a new system they're not guaranteeing that it's going
[553.06 → 558.62] to be successful, but it is not surprising to me and makes me quite happy that like the Anna team is
[558.62 → 565.96] like oh Geez we should try to save this, so the problem is that publishers are basically in control
[565.96 → 570.94] they're they are creating these situations where your only option is to either play an older one that
[570.94 → 575.86] supported LAN multiplayer which you could then play over the internet using a service like Karachi or
[575.86 → 580.88] something better or whatever else now or something I don't know some something like that some kind of
[580.88 → 588.82] some kind of VPN yeah um, or you're pushed to buy the new one the newer one that gets them more
[588.82 → 596.46] money because as we know gaming has gone from a product that you buy, and then you own service to a
[596.46 → 603.08] service that you are expected to continue to pay for and if you think that this is the only
[603.08 → 608.42] manifestation of that I mean we need to look no further than uh that tweet I sent out earlier this
[608.42 → 612.76] week about Diablo immortal I don't think we're ready for this we'll talk about that soon but first
[612.76 → 619.30] the solution to this is pretty straightforward, but it would require a grassroots movement that i just
[619.30 → 625.16] I don't see any foreseeable path to because a lot of these games that are going to die because of this
[625.16 → 630.48] don't have huge player bases exactly it's not it's not throwing anyone up in arms exactly this will
[630.48 → 637.58] be one of those things where slowly silently gaming will have changed completely we're going to wake up
[637.58 → 642.96] one day, and we're going to go holy crap I want to play that game from 10 years ago that I loved
[642.96 → 648.84] and there is literally no way to play it and enjoy it with my friends or my children because it has been
[648.84 → 655.18] wiped from the face of the earth what we need is legislation that forces these companies to if they
[655.18 → 661.08] are not going to maintain it we can't force them to maintain it I mean that's that's fair enough right
[661.08 → 667.66] fine you released this product, and we bought it, and ultimately you know what you can't maintain
[667.66 → 672.80] the service for it any more okay but if there's a community that is willing to put the effort in or
[672.80 → 680.68] the resources into it, they need to open source it then it's that simple you must either maintain the
[680.68 → 688.82] tools or release the tools yeah, yeah like subcom right yep super, super cool I also think I would
[688.82 → 692.26] like to make a note here there are a lot of things we have to talk about but I'll talk about this very
[692.26 → 698.14] shortly uh my family like my brother my dad and i and Joe actually have been playing this game
[698.14 → 704.44] called snow runner uh my dad's super into it that's really cool the multiplayer is rough there are often
[704.44 → 710.36] disconnects and if you disconnect you lose all your progress from that section that one player
[710.36 → 714.34] just loses every because you go all the way back to the garage, and it's a trucking game um, and it's
[714.34 → 718.68] like man if I could just host this server on my local computer yeah this probably wouldn't be a
[718.68 → 723.88] problem, but we have to go through server in OVH or something sure yeah if I have some way to control
[723.88 → 728.22] this won't actually be a problem and that makes us, so there's less maintenance and stuff for
[728.22 → 732.38] the companies to actually do in a lot of situations I think dedicated servers are the
[732.38 → 737.36] are the option and the answer in these cases but moving on you just talked about not being able to
[737.36 → 742.22] play a game that's 10 years old yeah now we have to talk about space junkies right space junkies is
[742.22 → 748.82] three years old is being recommend right now it is not highly rated I don't think a lot of people play
[748.82 → 756.98] it, but it's a multiplayer only online VR game from 2019 that is getting recommend there's some other
[756.98 → 761.46] interesting things as well about this if you look at the Uecomm list, and you find space junkies
[761.46 → 769.34] this is that game that I tried that made me absolutely nauseated in like 30 seconds yeah I've
[769.34 → 774.70] been trying to figure out what freaking game it was because I've talked about it before whenever i
[774.70 → 780.32] talk about nausea in VR I'm like yeah I'm usually pretty good, but there was this one awful game i
[780.32 → 787.64] played it drops you at least this was the okay if this is the one it dropped me right into the game
[787.64 → 793.90] with an open mic and everyone else had an open mic so it was literally like going back to original
[793.90 → 800.14] Xbox days of just children shrieking into your ears for no reason like there was no obvious way to turn
[800.14 → 805.18] it off at least quickly I think I did figure it out eventually um yeah if this is the game I think it is
[805.18 → 812.84] then it's an f***ING awful game yeah um and on here if you look at the list if you notice how
[812.84 → 817.94] all these things have like screen like okay yeah sure splinter cell blacklist it shows pc and then
[817.94 → 821.86] consoles right there are two different things happening there's a pc happening there's a console
[821.86 → 828.36] happening space junkies it only shows pc HTC five and oculus I think they maybe forgot that space
[828.36 → 837.32] junkies came out for PS4 um so I have no idea what's happening to space junkies for PlayStation VR
[837.32 → 844.22] because like they don't list it so maybe you'll still be able to play it on uh PS on PS4 what I do
[844.22 → 854.86] know pretty much for sure is they're becoming it for pc right except you can still buy it for 27
[854.86 → 861.54] dollars on the Ubisoft store they're decommissioning it in like what is it like two months or something
[861.54 → 864.96] wow it's still purchasable 27 bucks
[864.96 → 874.90] why oh so much of this is just so annoying and to be clear if you enjoy space junkies maybe you have a
[874.90 → 880.58] different opinion than I do that's fine that's super cool that's super normal sucks for you and
[880.58 → 886.96] this sucks because if they were forced to make the tools available at least if you and some friends
[886.96 → 892.88] wanted to get together and play some space junkies old school style you'd still be able to now this
[892.88 → 901.58] experience however good or bad it was is gone, and you might not care right now but there are releases in
[901.58 → 908.42] here uh like Far Cry 3 Far Cry 3 is a really legendary game yep you might think right now of the
[908.42 → 914.34] far cry series being extremely cookie cutter it became cookie cutter off of the success of Far Cry 3
[914.34 → 918.74] Far Cry 3 was so successful that they're like we're just going to make this game for 10 years
[918.74 → 926.30] um and they're making it so that you can't download or install DLC like no I'm not sitting here
[926.30 → 931.58] thinking that a ton of people are playing Far Cry 3 multiplayer but I do think that someone might feel
[931.58 → 937.08] nostalgic about Far Cry 3 down the line I want to go back and play it with all the DLC, and now they can't
[937.08 → 940.68] the bottom line is that the games' industry has just
[940.68 → 951.02] consolidated to the point where I feel like it's so difficult for a small independent studio to compete
[951.02 → 959.80] and the large players are so focused on how to extract the greatest amount of money possible
[959.80 → 966.98] from their audience that there's no room for anything else these smaller niche experiences no
[966.98 → 974.42] matter how little they cost to continue to maintain are just not even worth the time of bringing up to
[974.42 → 981.00] an executive because they just don't present the tiny budget that is required for it so it just gets cut
[981.00 → 989.06] and i you know this finally does come back to the tweet that I posted earlier this week
[989.06 → 994.34] where I said something along the lines of I mean it's probably easier to just pull it up at this point
[994.34 → 1000.06] something along the lines I've got it actually oh you got it okay no I don't whoop there you go
[1000.06 → 1009.64] gaming may be poo now but as gamers at least we can take comfort knowing it's all our fault and the
[1009.64 → 1017.78] thing that prompted this thought for me was that Diablo immortal is bringing in allegedly this is from
[1017.78 → 1027.08] Ars Technica so it's not exactly some random crap website allegedly over a million dollars a day
[1027.08 → 1035.52] in microtransactions, and it's like as long as we like as long as we lie down and take if it's a third
[1035.52 → 1045.12] of a billion dollars a year it's its never going to stop and I've seen I've seen man the kinds of the
[1045.12 → 1049.62] kinds of conversations that took place in the replies to this tweet I'd wish i I wish I could
[1049.62 → 1056.10] unread because they're just come on guys like the amount of gatekeeping oh well mobile games are ruining
[1056.10 → 1061.70] everything or this is mobile gamers are not true gamers and just all that kind of nonsense it's
[1061.70 → 1069.54] like no, no no gamers as a whole are allowing this change to happen we've been slowly boiled
[1069.54 → 1080.60] we're frogs guys it started with horse armour, and now you literally will hear true gamers real gamers
[1080.60 → 1085.60] you know whatever gatekeeping term you want to use for it, you'll hear them say well as long
[1085.60 → 1093.80] as it's just cosmetic it's totally fine I'm super into it don't you remember how outrageous it was
[1093.80 → 1100.24] for a developer to ship a game that wasn't done yet and make you pay piecemeal for the rest of the
[1100.24 → 1107.40] pieces of it later don't you remember and i I don't I'm some partially against that argument
[1107.40 → 1114.48] okay compared to a lot of what we've got now where you've got pay to win mechanics that people are just
[1114.48 → 1122.06] like okay with the weird fanboys defending lost ark's pay to win was an interesting thing to
[1122.06 → 1127.30] witness, but you got to remember there's this is an entire generation of people who grew up with this
[1127.30 → 1137.12] what the f*** are Pokémon cards if not pay to win, and it's and gambling yeah from the very start i
[1137.12 → 1145.62] mean my childhood had pay to win gambling as an integral part of it yeah so no wonder we accept
[1145.62 → 1153.56] this now yeah yeah i I think you talked about cosmetics and I don't like being able to buy
[1153.56 → 1158.14] cosmetics I've talked about that a lot on way I show because I would rather cosmetics be a reward for
[1158.14 → 1163.38] in-game accomplishment um but in some games like I would argue League of Legends like if you want to
[1163.38 → 1170.20] make League of Legends free how else are you going to monetize it I don't mind cosmetics and honestly
[1170.20 → 1174.88] actually i kind of do because they're getting to the point where I can't recognize champions anymore
[1174.88 → 1179.20] I don't play League of Legends enough every once in a blue moon I'll jump in with some friends
[1179.20 → 1183.54] and something will attack me and I'll be like who the heck is this and I'll, I'll assume it's a champion
[1183.54 → 1187.96] that came out after I quit playing and then I'll be like oh no that's a champion I've known for 10
[1187.96 → 1194.32] years but couldn't recognize it because now they're a fire god demon and I'm just like what is this yeah
[1194.32 → 1201.16] that was a big problem for me with tf2 I was super into tf2 and then along came hats and not just hats
[1201.16 → 1206.88] but all of a sudden there were these infinite different variations of weapon loadouts when
[1206.88 → 1213.40] the beauty of tf2 was that it was perfectly balanced voice orders yeah perf absolutely
[1213.40 → 1223.40] perfectly balanced and every class was so just perfectly instantly recognizable maybe that's
[1223.40 → 1228.46] something we should do at the land we should play tf2 classic vanilla tf2 yeah vanilla tf2 no
[1228.46 → 1234.18] no hats I'd be super into that no modded weapons mostly just because I want to play tf2 i I have
[1234.18 → 1238.78] heard from people that are like still into tf2 these days that they like those weapons because
[1238.78 → 1244.42] there's you can effectively make new classes by doing specific right that unbalances the game
[1244.42 → 1251.66] that's the whole problem with it the game so fine have your modded server with your crap other
[1251.66 → 1257.28] classes and don't make me play it yeah it'd be I'd be cool if there was like vanilla servers I wonder
[1257.28 → 1262.70] if there are I don't know there might be people are saying it's still balanced
[1262.70 → 1272.56] I mean it might be I have no idea sure this is great under over in the float plane chat says i
[1272.56 → 1275.96] actually had my nephew complain today that a mobile game didn't have a cash skin shop
[1275.96 → 1282.18] yeah I mean that's that's what we're used to now but that's where it's going blaming mobile
[1282.18 → 1289.48] gaming alone blaming mobile gaming alone is missing the point I mean compared to a franchise like FIFA
[1289.48 → 1295.98] yeah that too yeah I mean there's huge money that goes into FIFA whatever it's called ultimate team
[1295.98 → 1302.30] or whatever I don't I don't but remember halo like people were angry about the cash shop in halo
[1302.30 → 1309.78] and I read it all wrong because people were originally stuffed that I read about their anger
[1309.78 → 1314.24] about the cash shop was how expensive things were and that already for me is just like dude just don't
[1314.24 → 1318.84] buy it like why I don't know why is this even a conversation this is literally not an essential
[1318.84 → 1322.78] item yeah you the option of just not buying it I mean
[1322.78 → 1332.58] just don't buy i the best way to like get angry and protest this is to not buy it but clearly
[1332.58 → 1339.08] gamers as a whole have proven themselves at this point to be incapable of doing that yeah and
[1339.08 → 1344.28] the thing that I didn't understand about it wasn't just that it was expensive people wanted more
[1344.28 → 1352.48] they were unhappy that there wasn't enough stuff and I was like what you want more things
[1352.48 → 1358.56] in the cash shop and people were like livid about there not being enough stuff in the cash shop
[1358.56 → 1365.22] I was it was so confusing and then this Subreddit that I thought was complaining about the fact
[1365.22 → 1371.66] that there like was a cash shop or that how expensive and stuff that it was would start pinning
[1371.66 → 1377.12] the weekly things that were in the cash shop at the top of the Subreddit this isn't Microsoft doing this
[1377.12 → 1384.22] this is the community encouraging people to buy from the cash shop which is like whoa like i I don't
[1384.22 → 1391.14] remember my friends encouraging each other to buy legal legend skins you know what I mean yeah like that
[1391.14 → 1399.16] it's just it's so weird to me and like i i I ended up following more into the like the depths of
[1399.16 → 1404.14] trying to figure out why people were trying to defend lost ark being a pay-to-win game even though
[1404.14 → 1408.48] it like clearly is and I started looking into it and people were getting frustrated that there was
[1408.48 → 1417.98] caps on how much they could spend right, but the caps were like huge amounts of money, and they were
[1417.98 → 1422.46] like that's frustrating I want to spend more I have a daily cap on how much I can spend this is BS
[1422.46 → 1430.34] what is happening what is going on yeah I don't know i have chats with my son
[1430.34 → 1438.68] and actually my daughters too now that they're getting into uh gaming more that goes you know uh
[1438.68 → 1447.12] what is this does this exist in the real world no do we spend money on this no okay cool yeah
[1447.12 → 1455.26] i I have stuff I have bought cosmetics like i I bought rocket league for like four dollars I think
[1455.26 → 1462.16] it's fair million years ago up to uh up to a reasonable sticker price for a game yeah
[1462.16 → 1468.56] somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30 to 100 dollars I think is fair um and I have no problem
[1468.56 → 1477.18] to a point with DLC as long as it's I mean and again maybe it's just a generational thing as long
[1477.18 → 1483.10] as the DLC is styled after something along the lines of an expansion pack it's adding substantial
[1483.10 → 1490.54] content then absolutely exactly like i have oh man I've spent like probably 150 dollars on um
[1490.54 → 1500.02] on Anna DLC but every time it's like adding an entire new like biome that you can explore and
[1500.02 → 1505.26] like new characters and new missions and stuff that clearly wasn't actually part of the original game
[1505.26 → 1513.00] like we've talked about this before too like I don't feel like I need a new ANO no more stuff to do
[1513.00 → 1518.42] more things to explore more new mechanics stuff like that sounds great I don't need to like new graphics or
[1518.42 → 1524.22] it to be set in a different environment I mean it is there was the arctic one yeah so like yeah i
[1524.22 → 1528.58] mean I don't need a new ANO that's fine just give me more DLC stuff every once in a while yeah beat
[1528.58 → 1534.72] safer DLC is another example of what I would consider to be good DLC more content you licensed songs you
[1534.72 → 1542.28] actually like did work making new maps and stuff and I have no problem with that whatsoever
[1542.28 → 1547.86] you want to talk about cash shops and adding skins what about twitch bits yeah we've I think we've
[1547.86 → 1553.12] unanimously always said twitch bits are crazy yeah don't put don't use don't give us twitch
[1553.12 → 1559.16] don't give us twitch bits why are you why are you giving twitch like what is it like this wasn't
[1559.16 → 1568.32] the gotcha that I think you thought it was um we we literally tell our viewers hey
[1568.32 → 1575.62] don't send super chats on YouTube do not cheer anything we made it so that you get that part for free
[1575.62 → 1581.04] and you also get merch so we wanted to give you something we made merch messages so that you can
[1581.04 → 1587.52] just you can interact with the show, and you also get your order in the mail yeah it's not
[1587.52 → 1593.24] just nothing you actually get something yeah yeah and like so like I was talking about rocket league i
[1593.24 → 1598.20] bought it for like four dollars and then I ended up playing it like crazy so I bought some skins I bought
[1598.20 → 1603.32] a season pass at one point i I put money in that I thought was highly appropriate for the amount of time
[1603.32 → 1609.70] that I played the game, and then they were bought out by epic and then I stopped yeah like whatever
[1609.70 → 1614.56] that was the thing when it was like insomniac games or whatever it was before I was like yeah this is a
[1614.56 → 1619.70] small studio I want to support I really like this game I really like that there's like this competitive
[1619.70 → 1625.84] but like extremely family friendly it's literally just cars driving around game that is able to make
[1625.84 → 1633.86] it is like that's cool I want to support this so yeah why not speaking of the merch store if you are
[1633.86 → 1638.98] looking for something to order today if you want to send a merch message to appear in the little marquee
[1638.98 → 1645.08] down there or maybe get curated so that we can address it uh maybe bell will choose you today
[1645.08 → 1652.20] we've actually got a new shirt we just launched, and it is freaking awesome I wish we'd had the camera
[1652.20 → 1660.26] rolling in the pre-show when Luke was like unpacking it from uh these really awesome bags by the way did
[1660.26 → 1664.74] you notice this I didn't actually notice that I thought that was just like generic I am not a
[1664.74 → 1671.06] plastic bag 100 biodegradable that's cool yeah that's legit really cool we're working towards it
[1671.06 → 1675.90] feels exactly like a plastic bag much that's why it needs the label yeah we're working towards better
[1675.90 → 1681.22] more environmentally friendly packaging but I even thought the tag was pretty cool there's no way you're
[1681.22 → 1686.92] going to be able to see this unfortunately yeah it says RGB edition RGB collection all right yes sorry
[1686.92 → 1691.80] maybe there's more coming in the future don't know it's called the multistep t-shirt I know that's
[1691.80 → 1698.50] a really sort of boring um technical name for it but what it basically means is there's these little
[1698.50 → 1704.34] flecks of different colours that are woven into the base colour which is kind of like an off-white
[1704.34 → 1711.42] it's got a LTT logo embroidered in the front, and it is both extremely comfortable and in my opinion
[1711.42 → 1716.60] super cool looking I've actually gotten more comments on this particular piece of merch than
[1716.60 → 1720.30] most other ones you should get down to this photo, so people can really see it
[1720.30 → 1724.44] did I I think I already saw that one oh did you already see it yeah that one was okay my bad yeah
[1724.44 → 1732.82] we've got a cool little rainbow liner inside the neck to go along with the like rgb collection
[1732.82 → 1741.12] theme of it and again all this is also in my humble opinion it is very reasonably priced 24.99 it is
[1741.12 → 1746.10] a fair bit more expensive than our regular t-shirts it's a bit more of a complicated product, and it took a
[1746.10 → 1754.40] long time to get exactly right, but it looks really, really fun and cool in my opinion I'm so tired
[1754.40 → 1760.46] of wearing black t-shirts so this little splash of colour in my wardrobe is extremely no
[1760.46 → 1764.64] that's awesome welcome yeah definitely why don't we jump right into another topic you want to pick one
[1764.64 → 1773.72] sure let's jump over uh should we talk about the million dollars a day thing more or just
[1773.72 → 1781.96] no just it's equivalent of like two million subscribers to an MMO yeah wow 15 bucks a month
[1781.96 → 1789.02] that's a lot like wow so because the reason why I wanted to bring that up is like you're comparing
[1789.02 → 1796.46] business models right yeah crazy and like people are proud of it like there's twitch streamers that
[1796.46 → 1801.74] were showing on stream this is how much money I've spent so far, and it was like a counter so as they
[1801.74 → 1805.66] were playing, and they're spending more money it was constantly going up and like people were watching
[1805.66 → 1810.18] like that was a hype point people were watching because they wanted to like effectively see the number
[1810.18 → 1820.64] go up which is definitely helping people not do that um okay moving on your content it's actually
[1820.64 → 1828.94] for kids says YouTube um YouTube's AI is doing some really fun cool things there's a channel called local
[1828.94 → 1838.02] 58 TV that found that his explicitly 18 plus horror content was suddenly changed to made for kids, and he was
[1838.02 → 1843.74] unable to change it back without going through an appeal process the video was labelled as inappropriate
[1843.74 → 1849.92] for kids manually by him before it was changed by YouTube it took nearly 40 hours from when the
[1849.92 → 1855.64] creator went public on Twitter so, so much for the uh standard appeal process with his complaint for the
[1855.64 → 1863.08] change to be reverted why YouTube would automatically lower the age range for content is anyone's guess
[1863.08 → 1868.00] especially when YouTube kids is supposed to be this like kind of like safe content safe space for
[1868.00 → 1875.20] kids I thought it was supposed to be manually curated like YouTube kids the whole idea because back in
[1875.20 → 1880.12] the day there was already that problem with those weird like really weird like spider-man Elsa things
[1880.12 → 1889.34] yeah, yeah so they were supposed to fix it after that uh clearly not a thing what garbage I don't know
[1889.34 → 1895.46] what else to say about it other than that I mean it's this isn't just harmful to the platform
[1895.46 → 1901.12] and the user this is extremely harmful to the creator on the one hand you can get a ton of views in YouTube
[1901.12 → 1905.72] kids because you've just got these like zombie children some of which don't even know how to use
[1905.72 → 1911.62] the phone just staring at whatever the next autoplay just comes up yeah well their parents cook dinner
[1911.62 → 1917.18] or sleep in on a weekend or whatever the case may be and so you can rack up a ton of views but
[1917.18 → 1924.18] um if your video is getting served to the wrong audience it can actually be extremely damaging
[1924.18 → 1931.50] because if it will increase abandonment from the video which can drank you, so other creators like
[1931.50 → 1939.06] your movie sucks have also been affected and without any kind of manual fix for something like that which
[1939.06 → 1946.16] I sincerely doubt they would have this could result in long-term damage to their channel which raises
[1946.16 → 1952.62] lots of interesting questions like I don't think anyone's ever actually been able to prove that
[1952.62 → 1962.70] googled e-listed them or deranged them but if they could do that open does that open them up to a
[1962.70 → 1968.54] potential lawsuit could you sue for damages yeah i think I would be very interested
[1968.54 → 1975.34] yeah I don't know because what recourse is there for a parent who's been assured that YouTube
[1975.34 → 1980.04] kids is all family-friendly content and then there's 18 plus horror content which like
[1980.04 → 1985.26] could actually like really mess with a small child depending on what it is
[1985.26 → 1992.88] um I don't know that's spooky i i I'm assuming they're trying to stop ad abuse
[1992.88 → 2000.52] uh because I think you get more lucrative ads if you make content that isn't for kids or if you flag
[2000.52 → 2006.56] it is not for kids, but then it starts like trending with kids uh-huh I think you get better ads on it
[2006.56 → 2012.34] so I think they're trying to stop that but in trying to stop that they served horror content to children
[2012.34 → 2019.98] yeah and like i and I mean okay here's a question what difference does it make if you do
[2019.98 → 2025.60] allow your content to be viewed by adults if you want to pull it out of YouTube kids it just means you
[2025.60 → 2035.70] will get less views to kids okay I don't really see why they wouldn't just allow you to do that then
[2035.70 → 2046.64] yeah very frustrating in other news NVIDIA how bad do you feel for them right now not at all I think
[2046.64 → 2056.76] NVIDIA had ordered five nanometre wafers from TSMC before crypto winter hit what that means is that
[2056.76 → 2065.78] while NVIDIA and AMD let's be clear neither of them is some kind of white knight no saviour for gamers
[2065.78 → 2073.28] here no they're giant corpus at all they will sell GPUs to whoever is most profitable to sell GPUs to
[2073.28 → 2080.86] it's that simple, and we saw it proven over the last couple of years both of them so it's pretty
[2080.86 → 2087.08] amusing for us now to see that they forecasted their five nanometre wafer production
[2087.08 → 2094.40] or their wafer allocation with TSMC based on the kinds of volumes that they were moving selling to
[2094.40 → 2102.02] miners and NVIDIA has already been fined for not properly disclosing what percentage of their sales
[2102.02 → 2108.16] were the result of the GPU mining craze and NVIDIA it's hilarious they've gone they flip-flopped
[2108.16 → 2112.38] on the issue they've gone from we know exactly where every one of our chips goes to well we have
[2112.38 → 2118.80] no we have no way of knowing how many of them are being mined on versus game oh you so do you so do
[2118.80 → 2126.52] miners do not install g-force now for instance so you would know if your sales triple and your g-force
[2126.52 → 2134.68] now instances go up by 10 that probably some of it went to mining I would think right NVIDIA
[2134.68 → 2140.32] you can do data analysis right and as much as I tried to get people to not install g-force now
[2140.32 → 2146.30] because of all the telemetry crap I'm sure the vast majority of people do so it's convenient it is
[2146.30 → 2156.74] anyway the point is NVIDIA um booked five nanometre wafers with TSMC before they realized that their
[2156.74 → 2169.56] sales were going to go which means that the upcoming RTX 4000 series GPUs could have um a very good supply
[2169.56 → 2175.50] perfect supply potentially to the point where NVIDIA was trying to back out of
[2175.50 → 2180.12] a pretty significant amount of the wafers as far as I can tell or else I don't think this would be
[2180.12 → 2188.48] in the news um they TSMC just straight up was like nope they are apparently unwilling to make any
[2188.48 → 2194.40] major concessions they have agreed oh i I think this has got to be allegedly I'm not actually
[2194.40 → 2198.18] sure if this is confirmed so I'm just going to say allegedly because I'm not double-checking it
[2198.18 → 2203.78] but they've apparently agreed to delay first shipments by one quarter or even to q1 2023
[2203.78 → 2210.04] but if NVIDIA wants to bail on any of these orders they will apparently be responsible for finding
[2210.04 → 2217.30] replacement customers our discussion question this is funny our discussion question is who could NVIDIA
[2217.30 → 2227.00] find to take their orders well let's see there's intel's GPU which as far as we can tell so far is an
[2227.00 → 2233.76] absolute dumpster fire intel isn't going to need any more of those um wait is that even now is that even
[2233.76 → 2239.90] TSMC 5 nanometre I don't even think so TSMC 5 nanometers I mean there's the upcoming iPhone but
[2239.90 → 2247.08] isn't apple actually forecasting a reduction in demand as well, so apple probably has as much if not
[2247.08 → 2253.84] more allocation than they need I know Samsung is sitting on apparently piles of smartphones like
[2253.84 → 2260.78] way more than they usually would be because of the uh weakening of demand heading into what appears to
[2260.78 → 2272.20] be a potential global economic recession um yeah I don't know why I don't know I don't think anyone's
[2272.20 → 2281.08] really going to be clamouring at the bit to bail them out yeah okay uh Humboldt over on twitch says
[2281.08 → 2289.06] automakers that's a good question but actually no that's exactly its automakers don't need that kind
[2289.06 → 2295.32] of performance so they don't operate on the cutting edge node they don't even operate a node or a
[2295.32 → 2301.20] couple of nodes back unless their name is maybe tesla is on I was going to say modern there might be some
[2301.20 → 2308.84] like really expensive automated driving cars yeah, but that was a whole that was a whole drama around
[2308.84 → 2315.02] the whole automotive chip shortage where chip foundries were telling the automakers hey you guys
[2315.02 → 2320.88] got to update your crap because we can't, we can't keep these ancient manufacturing processes running
[2320.88 → 2327.60] like this is actually not feasible we can't ramp up more of this garbage you guys need to redo your
[2327.60 → 2334.42] designs on modern nodes so that we can take advantage of the economies of scale at these modern nodes that
[2334.42 → 2340.30] everything else is freaking running on and I mean of course the smaller transistors and smaller chip sizes
[2340.30 → 2345.80] and better power efficiency like guys get with the program so no they would be they would be the last
[2345.80 → 2352.94] ones to step in and take over five nanometre production um landmark says drone manufacturers no not
[2352.94 → 2363.86] even not even five nanometers they don't they don't need it um yeah, yeah new Nintendo Switch asks whiffs but I mean
[2363.86 → 2369.74] that would probably be awesome a Nintendo Switch with five nanometre performance and power efficiency I'm
[2369.74 → 2377.30] super down Nintendo enjoys releasing on last generations uh last generations a low performance
[2377.30 → 2384.14] yeah fair enough hardware yeah I don't think so flying crocodile says AMD yeah but you have to understand AMD
[2384.14 → 2391.10] probably has the same overbooking issue the exact same problem whatever is being reported about NVIDIA
[2391.10 → 2401.70] almost certainly applies to AMD as well like there 's's yeah cheap chips for gamers
[2401.70 → 2407.74] we're saying data centres, but data centres would buy completely products yeah yeah yeah they're going to buy
[2407.74 → 2412.74] the GPUs they're going to buy whatever they're not going to buy the wafers because these are
[2412.74 → 2417.82] they're trying to sell wafers they're not selling like they're selling fab capacity yeah right
[2417.82 → 2431.24] that's really expensive yeah yeah it's rough oh that is rough um something that isn't rough if we want
[2431.24 → 2436.94] to transition off this topic yeah sure no more Facebook account requirement for quest 2 we literally
[2436.94 → 2444.60] talked about this on last wan show yeah and uh apparently they heard this podcast and no one else's
[2444.60 → 2453.42] complaint no uh they're right did I say good guy Facebook finally uh yeah I mean it's a good thing
[2453.42 → 2458.88] it's a good thing I don't think they did it out of the kindness of their hearts I don't think this was a
[2458.88 → 2465.68] a good guy move as much as they saw it to be a logical necessity moving forward because there's some
[2465.68 → 2471.00] really weird things like if you're a company, and you want to set something up with uh I was
[2471.00 → 2477.56] going to say oculus but if you want to set something up with the meta quest it's such a terrible name
[2477.56 → 2484.74] um you have to set up like Facebook accounts with real people's names and assign them to those
[2484.74 → 2491.12] headsets that's really weird because it has to be like a verifiable name, or you have to like trick
[2491.12 → 2496.00] them with something that sounds realistic which is what as far as I know most like uh corporate
[2496.00 → 2501.46] outfits are actually doing uh but it just it gets very odd and yes you can buy whatever the
[2501.46 → 2506.28] enterprise one as if most corporations are actually doing that if they're is they're small if you're
[2506.28 → 2510.80] like some giant massive corporation sure but if you're some small corporation you're going to go uh no
[2510.80 → 2516.74] I'm going to buy the cheaper one and fake o a Facebook account and make it work that way um well plane chat
[2516.74 → 2523.82] is so mad they're like no lapsed memory says that's like saying good job to Thanos for adopting a child
[2523.82 → 2531.58] whose parents he just murdered and they point out that even though you no longer need a Facebook
[2531.58 → 2538.38] account you do still need a meta account which is owned by Facebook let's go um that it that
[2538.38 → 2545.70] helps a little bit I mean it's it is better um because you don't have to necessarily like to tie it to a
[2545.70 → 2550.60] public Facebook account that like has your name and everything on it which is whacked you can link your
[2550.60 → 2555.80] meta account to Facebook and Instagram if you want um so that's that's real cool hope you're
[2555.80 → 2561.80] stoked about that um oculus account users will be able to continue using that account until January
[2561.80 → 2568.64] 2023 uh then you will need to move to a meta account and a meta horizon profile I heard that's the new
[2568.64 → 2575.40] meta to continue using the meta VR device with your meta blah blah blah blah blah blah blah hate it
[2575.40 → 2580.52] hate it so much join the metaverse um as of now many users attempting to log in via Facebook have
[2580.52 → 2585.56] faced issues um some people reactivating counts these requests to have met have been met with
[2585.56 → 2591.58] instant suspension it's nice oh remember when we owned our software we talked about that earlier
[2591.58 → 2600.40] yeah remember when we owned our hardware peppering farms remembers um yeah then there are some notes
[2600.40 → 2605.76] about how meta's next VR headset might be called the quest pro uh the name was found in code from
[2605.76 → 2611.56] meta's august mobile app uh codename project Cambria which is what I've heard of yeah um has been shown
[2611.56 → 2617.16] off already and could be quest pro and could have full colour path pass through capability depth sensors
[2617.16 → 2622.94] yada some people are estimating the final retail price to be 800 to a thousand USD which sounds
[2622.94 → 2629.70] expensive unless they are fully planning on maintaining previous products along with this one
[2629.70 → 2634.14] right if they're discontinuing previous products it's too expensive they're not going to launch it
[2634.14 → 2639.98] at that yeah um but if quest 2 and quest pro exist simultaneously yes probably fine then I could see
[2639.98 → 2646.92] it i have to tell you I don't think that I'm going to be able to go inside out tracking if valve goes
[2646.92 → 2654.10] inside out I think I might just have to keep my I might just have to keep my index forever unless it
[2654.10 → 2659.14] gets wildly better yeah I well one of the things that it doesn't work very so for one thing
[2659.14 → 2664.36] when you are swinging your arms around really fast and a lot sometimes they can be easily carried
[2664.36 → 2670.92] outside what can be tracked conveniently from a head-mounted device and number two is that because
[2670.92 → 2676.78] when I stream bead safer I put on full body trackers i I don't I don't see any way that you would manage
[2676.78 → 2683.80] that with inside our tracking not with tech we have currently um, but it may not be feasible to
[2683.80 → 2690.92] even continue to compete with meta uh in the space like i I was looking at the market they even are i
[2690.92 → 2695.28] was looking at the market share numbers, and it's like not even on the same yeah there's a note in
[2695.28 → 2701.96] here that says is meta going to take over the VR space they already have liked it's they I hope valve
[2701.96 → 2707.40] keeps bothering or someone else keeps bothering I mean there are other niche high-end headsets there
[2707.40 → 2710.86] was one that we were talking about on when show I think a couple of weeks ago or a few weeks ago that
[2710.86 → 2714.46] looks amazing, but it's what it was like two grand or three grand or something stupid like that
[2714.46 → 2720.52] yeah i when I like pissed off the whole world um so I think it was around eight years ago when I said
[2720.52 → 2725.40] that VR wasn't going to take off for five to ten years I don't know if you remember that um and then
[2725.40 → 2732.76] it took about five to ten years, and then it took off so that was pretty cool um but i I think the
[2732.76 → 2740.58] like first jump was uh the quest two because that was huge right especially when you mean
[2740.58 → 2749.74] the first quest uh the first quest was oh you're saying the quest two is it is the jump it hit
[2749.74 → 2755.82] it hit pretty mainline there oh I see yeah I mean other companies tried Samsung had that weird
[2755.82 → 2761.42] like thing you could put your phone in that was dumb that was super dumb I hated that that just made
[2761.42 → 2768.10] people think VR was bad um but yeah with quest two like what what what was the one that went just
[2768.10 → 2776.68] like gang busters was that quest one or quest two launch date yeah October 13th 2020 I think
[2776.68 → 2786.66] that's right because uh covid hit and then that Christmas quest two just went crazy they were sold out like
[2786.66 → 2792.38] everywhere that was the first big first like notable jump I think I called that a little that
[2792.38 → 2797.78] happened later than I expected and then I think there's going to be another one um and then I think
[2797.78 → 2801.82] there's going to be another one after that when companies other than just oculus start making
[2801.82 → 2807.72] headsets um that like can actually compete loud face bob on float plane makes a good point says first
[2807.72 → 2812.12] jump was when they dropped the price of the original oculus to 300 bucks it still wasn't mainstream then
[2812.12 → 2817.96] yeah, and it still didn't really pop off that was a very good thing that needed to happen um
[2817.96 → 2823.88] but for mainstream adoption not for the health of the VR hardware market in general in my opinion
[2823.88 → 2829.34] because it's basically just subsidizing the hardware with your data something that no one other than
[2829.34 → 2836.24] Facebook has the capability or willingness to do yeah for sure, but yeah like quest two that Christmas was
[2836.24 → 2844.08] huge the amount of quest two sales was monstrous um and like uh VR games actually started to sell like
[2844.08 → 2850.56] pretty okay it's cooled down a fair amount since then um which is why I don't think it's like actually
[2850.56 → 2857.12] really here yet is because it has cooled down um and like indexes are still like two grand and like it's
[2857.12 → 2864.70] it's still a's still a bit of a rough space to get in um but yeah but hey at least the show is

[3002.50 → 3013.48] rogers went down I don't think it's an interesting topic well the most interesting thing about the
[3013.48 → 3021.28] have a telecom here whose cellular network absolutely pooed itself at 5 a.m today um and one of the most
[3021.28 → 3030.62] interesting things about it was that my aunt had her home alarm system start beeping because it lost
[3030.62 → 3036.94] cellular connectivity starting at about 2 in the morning that sounds very annoying they were able
[3036.94 → 3044.84] to disable it for five minutes at a time so because she had to come and take care of the kids today
[3044.84 → 3053.24] my poor uncle had to sit next to the alarm panel for the rest of the night and disable it every five
[3053.24 → 3060.60] minutes so that she could sleep poor thing because otherwise it would just go can't you like to shut it
[3060.60 → 3068.18] off somehow I mean they're not savvy enough to like to find the speaker and resolder it okay you know yeah
[3068.18 → 3073.46] yeah, yeah pretty rough hey you can't like break or flip it because that would be a security problem
[3073.46 → 3078.30] so there's some battery backup somewhere yeah she didn't tell us I mean obviously if we could have
[3078.30 → 3083.94] there's probably ways around it get it she didn't tell us because she rogers anyway sorry yeah she
[3083.94 → 3088.60] didn't tell us otherwise we could have told her hey you know just chill stay at home take care of
[3088.60 → 3093.14] take care of you know my uncle who didn't sleep you know guys why don't you guys take it easy today
[3093.14 → 3095.84] she just showed up at our house and was like yeah this happened last night lol
[3095.84 → 3102.80] okay uh so just so you know I'm not a monster I wouldn't have been like yeah come in and take
[3102.80 → 3108.88] care of the kids anyway but pretty rough so that was the whole that was the thing apparently the
[3108.88 → 3113.42] Ottawa police had to tweet out telling people to stop calling 9-1-1 to ask when their cell phone will
[3113.42 → 3121.34] be working again oh man every once in a while yeah every once in a while humanity just disappoints me
[3121.34 → 3131.52] this is hilarious um Alex did up this topic and put an I told you so in here I don't really
[3131.52 → 3138.30] have a discussion question or a discussion topic more just and I told you so for Colton who switched
[3138.30 → 3142.24] a large portion of the office to rogers this week despite me telling him they are crap
[3142.24 → 3150.02] every telco is crap they're all just crap in different ways I don't I don't know the last
[3150.02 → 3155.66] time that there was like a service provider that had a national outage uh I mean that's fair but I've
[3155.66 → 3164.46] also had my fair share of issues with Telus our current provider and I drop calls all the time I have
[3164.46 → 3170.34] better connectivity in my house with rogers i i i honestly I was happiest with bell even though
[3170.34 → 3174.64] everyone told me bell was garbage I was like I don't know my data speed I don't know if my data
[3174.64 → 3178.80] speed's fast or whatever but like my calls don't drop that was a while ago probably because you stayed
[3178.80 → 3182.98] in specific areas yeah it could be that I was just as far as my understanding goes bell's really spotty
[3182.98 → 3187.72] yeah, but that's the thing is everyone told me that if you're in a good spot then and yet here I was
[3187.72 → 3193.30] sitting thinking that calls disconnecting was some kind of like third world thing because I hadn't had a
[3193.30 → 3202.56] call drop in literally years uh hate it yeah yeah that's about it though I don't think this is
[3202.56 → 3209.94] really a ton to say you know what I don't hate let's talk about wide care oh man what a name I know
[3209.94 → 3216.00] right what a name it's an extended warranty service that is only available in Japan provided by Nintendo
[3216.00 → 3224.46] called yeah wide care uh it grants customers up to uh 750 in repairs or six repairs per year
[3224.46 → 3230.78] uh the warranty covers both accidental and water damage to your switch controllers and the dock
[3230.78 → 3239.98] price is 15 bucks a year or a dollar 50 a month or 2 000 yen and 200 yen um and the yearly subscription
[3239.98 → 3245.16] can actually be used outside the warranty period I would actually that's not really even a warranty
[3245.16 → 3253.94] in my opinion at that price that's closer to an insurance policy and in a way extended warranties
[3253.94 → 3260.72] are kind of an insurance policy but the fact that this can be as far as I can tell done on just an
[3260.72 → 3267.46] ongoing basis makes it different from an extended warranty that's what makes it an insurance policy
[3267.46 → 3272.28] I'm sure they'll stop providing it at some point well yeah, but the switch has already been out four or
[3272.28 → 3278.52] five years or whatever, and it says that as far as I can tell anyway that you can sing up for it
[3278.52 → 3283.90] like now you have to buy extended warranties typically at the time of purchase or within
[3283.90 → 3290.58] some short period, and they're for a finite amount of time just being able to have peace of mind that
[3290.58 → 3297.70] my whatever thing will continue to serve whatever purpose I would have been ongoing basis I pay 15
[3297.70 → 3303.44] bucks a year for that that's not bad I would have been viciously against it if it wasn't really cheap
[3303.44 → 3309.78] yeah, but that's what I'm saying like the price super cheap it's not extended warranty pricing it's like
[3309.78 → 3315.80] insurance pricing probably something won't go wrong but if it does hey great I've got insurance right
[3315.80 → 3322.48] like that's that's the whole point of it apparently they will cover up to 750 in repairs or six repairs
[3322.48 → 3329.88] a year and in my opinion I think it's a perfect deal especially for a mobile device I would hope
[3329.88 → 3338.80] that this doesn't address right to repair concerns no, and it doesn't make Nintendo suddenly a good
[3338.80 → 3344.30] consumer pro consumer company yes uh people in chat are pointing this out I was thinking about this
[3344.30 → 3348.56] already, and it's already in the dock so I think there's quite a unified conclusion on this
[3348.56 → 3359.24] if this covers joy-con drift like everyone should get it yeah I mean basically I don't know joy-con drift
[3359.24 → 3368.10] shouldn't be a problem no absolutely we installed third-party hall effect joysticks in the steam deck
[3368.10 → 3378.54] today oh good I have never used a like game controller that made me feel like i really
[3378.56 → 3389.48] had fine control i I never played dream cast never had a dream cast um it was awesome because you got to
[3389.48 → 3397.32] remember not only does a hall effect sensor have a much uh much better longevity because it's its
[3397.32 → 3405.36] magnetic based rather than potentiometer based um if it's centred perfectly it will be centred
[3405.36 → 3413.10] perfectly every time and valve also has a tool on the steam deck to allow you to adjust your dead
[3413.10 → 3419.76] zones so if you know you have an outstanding reliable joystick that will always centre perfectly
[3419.76 → 3425.16] and always read perfectly in every direction because it uses freaking magnets how do they work
[3425.16 → 3432.82] then you can reduce the size of your dead zone oh cool so my dead zones were so small that even
[3432.82 → 3437.78] playing a fps game because that's what happens when I try to play fps games on a controller so I'm
[3437.78 → 3444.02] like oh it's not moving it's not moving it's not moving and oh off we go right but I was actually
[3444.02 → 3450.28] able to fine tune it and aim that's pretty sweet oh cool oh I love it so one thing that I just thought
[3450.28 → 3456.40] of about the current topic started derail slightly but uh is that they entirely get to decide how
[3456.40 → 3465.54] much the repairs cost who does Nintendo oh they're the only one offering the service right so up to
[3465.54 → 3472.00] 750 in repairs but like how much does it cost to replace a joy-con yeah that's fair I don't know
[3472.00 → 3478.82] that's a good question um yeah we'll have to see I don't know I'm not like overjoyous about this
[3478.82 → 3484.24] because I would rather it was more of a right to repair situation I would rather that there was some
[3484.24 → 3489.80] form of solution given for joy-con drift i I don't think uh Nintendo is a saint of a company
[3489.80 → 3496.80] they have a lot of issues in this regard it's cheap it is only provided in Japan yep I wouldn't
[3496.80 → 3502.32] be surprised if this didn't go outside of Japan yeah there's a lot of only Japan stuff that companies
[3502.32 → 3507.32] like Sony and Nintendo do yeah or sharp or someone's saying joy-con repairs are free you can send them
[3507.32 → 3512.06] to Nintendo, and they will repair for free yeah for now but I think what Luke's saying is there needs
[3512.06 → 3519.54] to be a long-term solution um hold on a second constantly sending your controllers out and
[3519.54 → 3527.04] needing to wait like a super long time stop spamming it by the way um but okay I'm just gonna start
[3527.04 → 3535.16] banning people loud face bob says mad cats made a good one uh oh a good dream cast controller I mean I find
[3535.16 → 3541.68] that very I don't very difficult I doubt that did mad cats ever make anything good apparently they still
[3541.68 → 3549.12] exist really which I was surprised did they get bought out I mean I don't know maybe yeah look at
[3549.12 → 3556.46] this mad cats dare to lead aren't these the same products that they had like a decade ago I don't
[3556.46 → 3562.84] think so like this is a different rat I mean a lot of the branding is the same I remember them having
[3562.84 → 3568.48] like a strike keyboard back in the day the rat looks very similar it might technically be different but
[3568.48 → 3574.06] this looks really, really similar it's a triumphant return of the beloved rat apparently so yeah I think
[3574.06 → 3579.32] it's supposed to look similar Luke I don't think anyone I mean their site is not even loading pictures
[3579.32 → 3587.16] for me right now this is amazing I don't think anyone loved the rat uh I mean the other pm that i
[3587.16 → 3595.70] worked with at NCI who was in charge of mad cats loved the rat he was so desperate to sell rats man
[3595.70 → 3606.06] oh no uh what else we got today oh, oh uh we also have a deal of the week
[3606.06 → 3615.16] okay this is odd uh if for whatever reason you were to find yourself needing a lot of hats
[3615.16 → 3619.58] uh hats for you and all your friends the deal
[3619.58 → 3631.16] the deal of the week is bought four dad hats of any style on LTT store and get them for 50 off
[3631.16 → 3642.98] four hats for 40 dollars so yeah need lots of hats in lots of different styles let me tell you
[3642.98 → 3652.20] where you can go you're going to want to go clothing okay wait are hats clothing are they clothing or gear
[3652.20 → 3664.40] there we go dad hat and here you will find all the different styles like washed black khaki gray blue red
[3664.40 → 3670.92] and other more different black deep black all right cool so there you go guys you need a fresh
[3670.92 → 3677.18] supply of dad hats we got you covered we should probably do a couple merch messages actually bell hit me
[3677.18 → 3687.16] hello uh first question here speaking of Nintendo any updates did we ever hear from Nintendo after the
[3687.16 → 3693.92] video was posted nope I mean it's still early there's plenty of time realistically I don't think
[3693.92 → 3701.60] there's a lot that they can say about it everything that we did was here legal um it's just
[3701.60 → 3709.24] one of those things where my you know my position is that Nintendo has a lot of growing up to do as a
[3709.24 → 3716.90] company they need to just chill out a little bit figure out what their value add is to
[3716.90 → 3721.68] gamers and stop intentionally antagonizing them I think they could actually be more successful
[3721.68 → 3729.44] if they took a more open approach to both their hardware and their software and um i just i I get
[3729.44 → 3736.08] very frustrated with their hypocrisy where they'll go after emulation as a whole and the developers of
[3736.08 → 3745.84] emulators, and then they'll go and use emulators um like okay are you against it or do you view it as a
[3745.84 → 3751.22] as a valuable tool you can't really have it both ways it frustrates me when companies have games that
[3751.22 → 3761.08] have like very prevalent competitive scenes, and then they just like pretend they don't exist um it'd be
[3761.08 → 3765.40] nice to see Nintendo like engaging with the smash community or whatever also though that community is
[3765.40 → 3775.52] like super sketched so a little questionable but yeah from Alan as a guy who runs a high school esports
[3775.52 → 3780.44] team and helps the tech department do you have any thoughts on high school esports teams oh hold on i
[3780.44 → 3786.10] want to clarify something I think it was actually Sony that um used an emulator in a product that they
[3786.10 → 3791.06] that they ended up releasing that was not developed by them was it that was it them guys help me out in
[3791.06 → 3796.38] the chat here it was Nintendo as well I thought so too but I'm not immediately finding it so
[3796.38 → 3804.84] uh sorry what was that bell uh from Alan he runs an esport team at a high school and wonders what
[3804.84 → 3812.28] your thoughts are on high school esports teams uh I mean I don't really see it as any different from a
[3812.28 → 3819.38] high school chess club or like uh I was in our group that I was in the group that represented our
[3819.38 → 3826.58] school at the physics Olympics hey me too like i it what's the what's the difference between that and
[3826.58 → 3832.38] any other organized school activity I don't know that
[3832.38 → 3841.86] I don't know that I would want it to become like an all-consuming thing for my kids at that age like
[3841.86 → 3846.42] I'd like them to make sure that they're also getting their fair share of physical activity but
[3846.42 → 3855.40] i i I think that it's its like any other school club it's a great way to foster relationships with
[3855.40 → 3862.00] like-minded people and build friendships and uh i I think there's a lot of opportunity to learn a lot
[3862.00 → 3866.60] of the same things that you would in any other organized sport for example like teamwork and
[3866.60 → 3872.94] communication yeah I mean I don't know what else to say about if it's a school club I would focus on
[3872.94 → 3881.00] those things that you just said focus on getting them to effectively don't make it very
[3881.00 → 3888.38] hard for them to tell that that's your goal um but teach them like life skills leadership um communication
[3888.38 → 3896.84] stuff like that from Sam we're looking for another Linus paint tips anything any suggestions for outdoor
[3896.84 → 3903.98] painting or porch painting oh porch painting is tough pretty much anything you walk on will wear
[3903.98 → 3912.32] off so if I had to if I had to paint a walk-on surface I would be sure to use a stain um something
[3912.32 → 3919.40] that soaks into the material like an oil or a stain um because when you redcoat that kind of stuff
[3919.40 → 3929.14] it's uh it's sometimes not always a lot less work because it's like it soaks into it soaks into
[3929.14 → 3934.88] the material which means that it's not going to flake off in quite the same way that uh that a paint
[3934.88 → 3940.84] would and once paint starts to fail, and it starts to flake you have to go at it hard and get everything
[3940.84 → 3946.52] possible off before you decode it otherwise it will continue to flake under the new paint, and it will
[3946.52 → 3951.50] create like cracks where moisture can get in, and it will start to lift all the paint so you'll
[3951.50 → 3958.66] basically just be wasting your time um as for outdoor I mean yeah the main thing is prep is
[3958.66 → 3965.04] most of the job applying the paint to the wall is like a third of the battle so you got to make sure
[3965.04 → 3971.06] you get everything scraped off scrape sand white prime paint anywhere the paint is failing cracking
[3971.06 → 3976.04] alligator peeling it's a lot of work
[3976.04 → 3983.64] from Nathaniel hi Linus question on your role as CEO and the future of Yvonne and partners
[3983.64 → 3989.00] do you envision becoming too big for you to candidly engage with your community or everything in the
[3989.00 → 4000.04] works oh i I mean there's lots of stuff that's going on that we don't necessarily talk about
[4000.04 → 4005.68] yeah I mean i I want to talk about more things we shot a lab update today that I think is going to
[4005.68 → 4012.56] be a really cool video we basically went through every member of the lab both new like on probation
[4012.56 → 4019.50] and established and looked at what they're working on the the the probation the probationary people had
[4019.50 → 4027.64] to wear a fallout guy masks and a guy fox mask so because they're still anonymous but anyway um
[4027.64 → 4039.20] is that the yeah okay yeah yeah um it's the development team yeah yeah i hmm is it just the
[4039.20 → 4044.72] development team is anyone else no everyone else is cleared for camera uh do you envision becoming
[4044.72 → 4051.96] too big to candidly engage with your community man I don't want to I don't want to be so big that
[4051.96 → 4059.24] the lawyers have to do a sanity check on what I say and I don't want to get to the point where I'm
[4059.24 → 4066.16] so detached that I don't have our own internal checks and balances to make sure that I don't say
[4066.16 → 4072.16] anything too stupid I mean as it is we're not at any risk of that because I can, I need both my hands
[4072.16 → 4077.90] to count the number of people that will just tell me I'm an idiot when I say something stupid and
[4077.90 → 4085.32] uh you know that are able to get me to back down on a bad idea I mean we actually had
[4085.32 → 4091.84] something like that happen this week i I had I was in a conversation with Colton, and we were like hey
[4091.84 → 4097.96] we should embrace the whole name of the whale land and just make every ticket like a whale ticket
[4097.96 → 4105.84] so every ticket includes admission a wan hoodie a desk pad a tour of the office up a food truck
[4105.84 → 4112.48] voucher you know thing for three meals a day and all this, and we should just have like put all
[4112.48 → 4118.06] these like bundles together, and it should be like 500 tickets, and we were like yeah let's yeah let's do
[4118.06 → 4123.76] it and on the surface it's actually not a terrible idea from a business standpoint because
[4123.76 → 4129.58] the reality of it is we only have a couple of hundred seats and there was a lot of value being baked into
[4129.58 → 4135.96] those tickets we are going to sell through that couple hundred seats like that if it was a thousand
[4135.96 → 4143.74] dollars it would sell through in like 15 minutes so really whatever price we ultimately settle on
[4143.74 → 4152.46] is how much revenue do we want to make from the land we have no way of expanding the capacity because
[4152.46 → 4157.08] it's going to be in lab two we're actually going to be in the warehouse of lab two running the land it's
[4157.08 → 4165.30] going to be freaking awesome um and that was a way for us to maximize that revenue for the company
[4165.30 → 4172.34] which we need while also providing a really solid value to anyone who buys the ticket because it was
[4172.34 → 4180.02] going to be like a bundle deal however you know Luke made a perfect point that was like hey like
[4180.02 → 4185.60] my dad and my friends won't be able to like to afford that and go it's its especially
[4185.60 → 4193.16] okay fair enough we haven't announced a date, but the date will not be super far out from when we do
[4193.16 → 4202.76] announce it um and if the ticket's like 250 500 um that's a lot of spending money to come up with
[4202.76 → 4209.26] on a like a super short notice if it was planned like six months ahead maybe even then it's still a
[4209.26 → 4213.24] lot of spending money to throw at one event um and like yeah you are getting other stuff you're getting
[4213.24 → 4217.52] the mouse pad potentially you're getting this hoodie like it there's a lot of value in there
[4217.52 → 4225.04] and my pitch to Luke how sick would it be if all the pictures and video from the land were people
[4225.04 → 4230.24] in this like uniform gaming like everyone's wearing the same hoodie that would have been so cool pretty
[4230.24 → 4234.86] cool, but there's also issues with that if people are coming to land they're very likely super fans
[4234.86 → 4240.68] they might already have one of the hoodies yeah so we don't want them to end up with a second hoodie
[4240.68 → 4246.38] so yeah to be pretty rough clear we're not doing that yep so we'll, we'll figure out something that
[4246.38 → 4252.36] kind of makes sense and I think we'll try to we'll try to have like bundles and add-ons as things that
[4252.36 → 4258.84] people absolutely can buy as part of the experience like i I think we'll probably do studio tours we've
[4258.84 → 4262.78] done them during Ltd before in the past, and it's been a pretty fun way to engage with the community
[4262.78 → 4267.48] coming back to that question do you envision becoming too big to candidly engage with the community I think
[4267.48 → 4276.12] if I do we will completely lose i think we'll fail ultimately so i I don't think that
[4276.12 → 4281.16] i or I mean I'd love to think that we have a leadership team that could carry on without me
[4281.16 → 4286.38] i I'd like to think that we will not stop engaging with the community whether it's reading comments or
[4286.38 → 4292.42] talking to people like this or whatever that ends up looking like and I mean Luke and i both intend to sit
[4292.42 → 4298.46] in with the general population at the land not because we have to because but because that's
[4298.46 → 4303.70] something we want to do um I don't I don't see that changing anytime too soon
[4303.70 → 4310.84] from Joshua hey Luke we all know starting flow plane and running it hasn't been easy over the years
[4310.84 → 4314.96] but according to you have there been any memorable or best parts of running the flow plane
[4314.96 → 4322.52] uh system and team um I will say that that's one of the downsides of having an all remote team
[4322.52 → 4330.16] um is like i I think we've done a good job of um especially like talking to other people that have
[4330.16 → 4334.48] that have worked on remote teams and talking to my friends who have managed remote teams and
[4334.48 → 4339.20] and stuff I think we've done a pretty good job of like keeping productivity up and and and doing
[4339.20 → 4343.64] things like that I think our meeting structure has been good and mentally healthy for people and
[4343.64 → 4351.50] Ada Ada Ada um but not having everyone together all the time definitely reduces or ever because
[4351.50 → 4356.14] of covid or ever yeah because it was supposed we were supposed to have these like yearly meetups
[4356.14 → 4362.10] around Ltd and then that's obviously not a thing hey we should fly them in for the land
[4362.10 → 4368.36] I'm down some of them are in like overseas
[4368.36 → 4372.46] okay I'll ask um
[4372.46 → 4381.56] he's like land I want to land okay well i guess there 's's at least one
[4381.56 → 4389.96] um okay yeah well I'll try to figure that kind of stuff but yeah it limits the chance of some
[4389.96 → 4395.40] of those types of moments right some of those team building kind of moments um so we I try to
[4395.40 → 4401.34] create that as much as possible but yeah it's it is limiting I remember uh one of my favourite times
[4401.34 → 4405.52] I think there was a there was a crunch I don't even necessarily remember what it was for but i
[4405.52 → 4412.72] remember verified actual gamer no, but that one was actually perfect that one was cool it was it
[4412.72 → 4417.94] was a float plane feature crunch and I was it was when I had my office was your current office
[4417.94 → 4424.62] and I remember being there until like six in the morning or something and just like anytime you're in
[4424.62 → 4431.66] voice chat with people working on something, and it gets past like 3 a.m things get a little wild
[4431.66 → 4440.84] yeah, yeah so that was good um and I mean there's been there's been a lot of them there's been
[4440.84 → 4446.94] it's its mostly like the things that we have created have been like really cool, and it's the
[4446.94 → 4451.02] accomplishments and stuff it's not necessarily the like day-to-day moments because we are
[4451.02 → 4459.34] literally disconnected right so yeah yeah let's just let's bring them out for the land cool sounds
[4459.34 → 4467.30] good yeah from David sad to see the LDT intros disappearing how's that experiment been going
[4467.30 → 4474.64] any insights to share um overall viewership is up on the channel um pretty consistently over the last
[4474.64 → 4479.88] six months it's been slow-going it's really noticeable how much YouTube is emphasizing shorts
[4479.88 → 4485.08] and I think a lot of it's coming out of promotion for back catalogue that's my gut feeling i I don't have
[4485.08 → 4490.46] detailed analytics to share with you guys where I can where I can prove it like that's the that's
[4490.46 → 4495.94] the challenge right is it's, and it's always changing it's like it's shifting sands under you so
[4495.94 → 4501.00] you just you do your best with it, you pick up your divining rod you try and find water algorithm
[4501.00 → 4506.70] water right um it's hard to say because we're always changing so many things whether it's topic
[4506.70 → 4515.46] selection or um you know writing style or uh like the text that we have at the beginning of the
[4515.46 → 4520.02] videos now that's designed to improve retention when people are scrolling with their audio off try
[4520.02 → 4524.62] to kind of hook them into the video it's just you're changing so many things it's hard to tell
[4524.62 → 4533.30] what exactly is making the difference, but overall viewership is super, super healthy across the
[4533.30 → 4541.48] empire um I actually have a dashboard that allows me to see all of them at once now but I'll need a
[4541.48 → 4549.82] minute if I'm going to try to sign in to it to show it to you guys um I would say though
[4549.82 → 4558.50] gut feeling wise that reducing the amount of filler in the first 30 seconds of the video is
[4558.50 → 4563.26] almost certainly a good thing for long-term viewer satisfaction yeah
[4563.26 → 4573.00] in the meantime from Thomas question for Linus and Luke what kind of quality control and continuous
[4573.00 → 4580.56] improvement processes are there at leg we do so much stuff that's a difficult question to answer
[4580.56 → 4584.98] because we do so many different things and each department is going to have different ways of
[4584.98 → 4591.58] handling that yeah that's a lot i I don't even know I don't even know what I mean we review every video
[4591.58 → 4597.82] uh I mean okay you and your in your development digest you were talking about that super cool new
[4597.82 → 4603.72] thing that allows you to roll back stuff oh that's not that's not out yet but yeah um I don't know
[4603.72 → 4608.56] that we're we're going to be working with a system that's going to allow us to do a b testing and
[4608.56 → 4614.66] rollbacks um but in regard to quality control like we have a CCD pipeline um
[4614.66 → 4619.54] we could talk about this for a super long time
[4619.54 → 4632.30] um all right I feel like it would probably be a bad idea for me to show this particular
[4632.30 → 4639.08] um number so I'm just gonna I'm hold on don't worry I'm being very responsible Luke
[4639.08 → 4644.18] I'm being a very responsible boy who only shares analytics that don't matter
[4644.18 → 4651.68] there okay, okay coming with no pen I think that seems fine Argo that was any of it yeah yeah uh
[4651.68 → 4656.82] yeah it's not out yet though hold on let me just let me just fix this up okay all right yeah that this
[4656.82 → 4663.74] this should be this should be completely fine, so this is a super cool little dashboard that I have
[4663.74 → 4667.84] that actually has all of our almost scrolled the page
[4667.84 → 4676.98] so close you didn't do it though that's a win it has all of our all of our channel videos on it we
[4676.98 → 4684.42] can see things like what's um performing better than it was what's performing worse than it was
[4684.42 → 4692.36] what's getting views in the last 48 hours or uh I believe this real-time one can also show
[4692.36 → 4697.82] 60 minutes no this this one doesn't I don't think and then if I dig deeper into
[4697.82 → 4705.26] the analytics I can see more here we go well I just need to make sure I don't show anything
[4705.26 → 4713.16] that'll get me in trouble because I think if i just straight up and look yep here's our CPMs I am
[4713.16 → 4719.06] going to I'm going to cause some headaches for some people that I like a lot and want to continue working
[4719.06 → 4731.38] with I hate how this dashboard works now I actually cannot understand why it doesn't just
[4731.38 → 4745.06] show me the overall views not by content I just want to see views i yeah I can't
[4745.06 → 4755.34] use by channel how do i just how do I just combine them which one's hide metric okay all right here
[4755.34 → 4762.08] maybe you guys can help me with this there you go so you can see all the channels here if I can I
[4762.08 → 4768.72] unselect LTT oh no I can show only LTT okay cool so if we look at only LTT we only got this dashboard
[4768.72 → 4774.40] a little while ago so it's only going back to February, but you can see overall this trend line is up
[4774.40 → 4782.04] obviously we have our spikes and our dips and then if we take LTT out and take out also the
[4782.04 → 4788.18] channels that really don't get a lot of views like uh they're just movies um channel super fun
[4788.18 → 4795.40] spiky so I'm going to pull that out you can see that the overall trend is towards more views which
[4795.40 → 4801.18] is you know obviously the objective of what we're doing more importantly the business team the merch team
[4801.18 → 4809.08] um labs team is all working on ways constantly to help us monetize the content better because
[4809.08 → 4816.36] at the end of the day if the only lever that you have to pull is make more content eventually you're
[4816.36 → 4822.50] going to collapse under your own weight we can't have 300 channels that we're managing and expect to
[4822.50 → 4828.22] do it with the kind of polish and quality that we do care it's like when you go to a restaurant
[4828.22 → 4835.54] and the menu is like 10 pages deep and dense and there's like a just a bazillion things it's
[4835.54 → 4840.06] like oh this probably isn't going to be very good because they're probably not cheesecake factory
[4840.06 → 4847.86] I love cheesecake I don't know if I've ever oh their menu is ridiculous I've been there once it's a novel
[4847.86 → 4851.94] I've been there one time and I know it's trashy I like it anyway
[4851.94 → 4861.90] all right I don't want to stir up any controversy oh no this really this stood out this is from
[4861.90 → 4868.70] Patrick Linus why do I see you in regular shoes during the YouTube shorts are the socks and sandals
[4868.70 → 4875.34] a scam that is concerning yeah this is a problem my sandals broke and I've been too lazy to replace them
[4875.34 → 4884.48] wow yeah it's actually surprising it's like next level yeah um fun fact the only reason i ever
[4884.48 → 4890.44] replaced any of my sandals ever I have never bought a pair of those sandals those like echo sandals that
[4890.44 → 4895.32] I wear my aunt would always buy them for me yeah and then I told her I'm a grown-ass man you can stop
[4895.32 → 4903.68] buying me shoes at some point, and so she did and now I don't have shoes except the vessels that Jessie
[4903.68 → 4905.48] sent me for free so I put those on
[4905.48 → 4913.38] i uh these shoes yes you know what I got those
[4913.38 → 4921.62] was it around the time you started working here sure was there are massive holes in them the right
[4921.62 → 4926.24] foot i I put them in the dryer one time, and it got caught in part of the dryer because I didn't
[4926.24 → 4930.34] have a dryer bag for my shoes because I was too cheap, and it got caught in the sidewall of the dryer
[4930.34 → 4938.10] so it has a permanent like uplift on the end of it uh there are identical rips on each
[4938.10 → 4943.60] shoe uh because I stopped because of covid but when I used to do boxing training every week
[4943.60 → 4950.30] the like side to side movement would stress out the same part of the shoe they are ratty but they
[4950.30 → 4956.14] don't sell these anymore I actually put a bounty out for a pair that were this size that was like
[4956.14 → 4962.16] I think it was like 300 bucks or something yeah I was like i really just want these shoes and you
[4962.16 → 4968.28] just can't get them I have never worn a pair of shoes that fit as nicely as these, and it's not like
[4968.28 → 4972.08] oh it's because they're worn in I remember when I first put them on the store I was like whoa these
[4972.08 → 4976.38] are perfect I should have bought like a bunch that's what I did with the badminton shoes that i
[4976.38 → 4980.78] have now I should have done a pair of court shoes that was like these fit me like a glove I bought six
[4980.78 → 4988.54] pairs yeah and like these are just like racked right I've gone and tried to like tried to spend
[4988.54 → 4992.98] good money and buy nice shoes because I think you should have like shoes that fit you well and stuff
[4992.98 → 4998.64] um and i I can't find anything that even remotely compares I've tried a bunch of different brands
[4998.64 → 5004.54] I've tried to like I don't know I can't figure it out oh man never change Luke never change
[5004.54 → 5012.56] from Andy it's been just over a year since your don't build a Hackintosh video do you think
[5012.56 → 5020.32] Hackintosh is dead oh wow yeah pretty much I mean it's very clear that the software innovation that
[5020.32 → 5029.96] apple is putting into macOS is Apple Silicon centric going forward I think they still sell some intel
[5029.96 → 5036.98] based max do they I don't even I don't even know I know nobody's talking about them no one cares about
[5036.98 → 5044.52] them can tell yeah the mac pro is still for sale for the time being so it will be at least
[5044.52 → 5052.22] some years after the last intel mac rolls off the line that you will still be able to run macOS on
[5052.22 → 5059.92] intel silicon but i i just don't see it being viable in the long term
[5059.92 → 5067.46] from sense op hi Linus and Luke hope you're doing well I wonder if either of you like Lego or if
[5067.46 → 5075.64] you have any favourite sets I feel like I'm feeding into my own stereotype today but Lego is really
[5075.64 → 5085.30] expensive um it is okay i uh I never got way too into Lego when I was a kid um I think partially
[5085.30 → 5091.20] because uh my family had some financial struggles and Lego is really expensive but I think it's pretty
[5091.20 → 5099.72] cool uh my girlfriend for Christmas bought me uh these this little like uh there was like a plant
[5099.72 → 5106.20] and animals Lego release thing, and she found one that was two budgies, and they like somewhat colour
[5106.20 → 5110.32] matched the budgies that we have so she bought me those and I built that and put it together and it
[5110.32 → 5114.64] was it's pretty cool I enjoyed that I thought that was cool the ones that you have are sweet
[5114.64 → 5120.00] I didn't know those existed at all I actually ended up looking them up after I got home and then was
[5120.00 → 5126.10] like I'll leave that to him um, but they're really cool like they're like piano and stuff, and they have
[5126.10 → 5132.76] this whole architecture line I think that's awesome um yeah really cool stuff just really pricey and i
[5132.76 → 5135.62] don't know what I would really want to do with it when I was done that's another
[5135.62 → 5143.60] Ivan really likes the uh the flower ones we are actually using Lego flowers in place of
[5143.60 → 5149.78] real flowers in our house because they just look like if you don't look closely they actually look
[5149.78 → 5154.74] pretty convincing and then if you look closely like oh cool that's kind of cool yeah, yeah so that seems
[5154.74 → 5160.04] like a very us thing to do, but it's not the kind of thing that I do enjoy putting the sets together but
[5160.04 → 5165.92] I've just never found that I had the vision to come up with my own stuff like my eight-year-old
[5165.92 → 5170.98] daughter will put together more creative stuff out of the spare parts bin that I would be able to
[5170.98 → 5175.74] come up with i just that's what I really liked with Lego is like back in the day we had just like
[5175.74 → 5180.78] I don't think I don't think we ever had sets when we were growing up but we had just like a bin of
[5180.78 → 5184.74] like some whatever I don't know if we got it from what it doesn't matter, but we had just like a bin
[5184.74 → 5191.14] and I had a fun time just like making whatever I would make things to like to push my little model
[5191.14 → 5197.94] cars through or whatever I don't know that's fine AJ techie 369 asked me if there's an update on the
[5197.94 → 5204.38] on YouTube following up with me regarding the comment spam so I do need to give you guys that
[5204.38 → 5210.26] um maybe we can take a merch messages break and go over that for yeah maybe just let me just make
[5210.26 → 5216.00] sure that this is not like controversial or anything like that uh yeah it looks like I have
[5216.00 → 5225.86] been invited to speak with YouTube they're um they're continuing to investigate and uh they want me
[5225.86 → 5233.06] to talk about any of my experiences on any of our channels around impersonation porn bots or scams
[5233.06 → 5239.38] crypto bots or scams ad scams users being directed toward telegram signal WhatsApp etc conversations
[5239.38 → 5246.64] between seemingly fake users and comments other types of spam or scummy behaviour and uh i I am going
[5246.64 → 5252.70] to try to make time for this I would really like to see an end to this problem on the platform so
[5252.70 → 5258.70] anything that I can do to help I think would be a positive thing especially if I'm going to call them
[5258.70 → 5265.12] out you know the least I can do is if they do reach out and say you know hey we value your feedback
[5265.12 → 5270.78] you know what can we do about it um the least I can do is actually provide that feedback right
[5270.78 → 5276.56] um so I also heard from a friend who works at YouTube sort of I mean it's like a business
[5276.56 → 5283.06] relationship, but you know we chat about business too yeah friendly um just kind of clarifying if i
[5283.06 → 5288.18] have increased strictness turned on all my channels clearly our discussion last week has
[5288.18 → 5295.34] penetrated the YouTube bureaucracy um am I correct in understanding that the majority of these are in
[5295.34 → 5301.04] replies rather than root comments and apparently there's uh yeah there 's's there's action
[5301.04 → 5309.46] there's action being taken and I'm glad I'm glad to see it, and hopefully they will take strict enough
[5309.46 → 5317.64] decisive enough action that we can get rid of the problem expunge the scammers and then slowly work
[5317.64 → 5322.44] our way back towards you know the features that are nice to have as long as they're not
[5322.44 → 5329.66] being abused yeah like I'm going to hold praise back until they do something um and I still think it's
[5329.66 → 5335.12] ridiculous that are like that they're like are you telling me these are mostly in replies instead of
[5335.12 → 5342.42] like look yeah at your own platform I mean i I literally screen capped as we live discovered
[5342.42 → 5350.10] yeah the problem last week but yes still so i I think the amount of credit that is due for them
[5350.10 → 5356.44] reaching out is not super high but if they do something about it, it's better than nothing yes if
[5356.44 → 5360.52] they do well I don't know I don't actually think it has any value if they don't do anything about it
[5360.52 → 5366.76] um that's why I'm kind of like withholding praise personally for now if they take action if they do
[5366.76 → 5373.04] things about it then sweet that's good but yeah Jim sent on float plane says there is apparently a
[5373.04 → 5379.66] deal at Walmart on the Lego flower bouquet the marketing AI is listening that is the creepiest
[5379.66 → 5386.56] stuff I can't prove it you know I can't prove it, but anecdotally boy does it ever feel like that
[5386.56 → 5390.90] happens doesn't it yeah you're talking about something and all of a sudden your ad feed is full
[5390.90 → 5395.50] of like you know make an offhand comment about blow-up dolls and all of a sudden all my ads are for that
[5395.50 → 5401.08] I mean I've never searched for that before of course not yeah why would you
[5401.08 → 5407.34] I've genuinely never understood the appeal it's very weird but blow-up dolls yeah you're more of
[5407.34 → 5412.94] a real doll guy right I mean i probably if I was choosing between the two then yes, yes he can afford
[5412.94 → 5420.52] it he won't buy shoes but like can he ever buy a real doll oh man that's funny
[5420.52 → 5428.80] uh to add more to people's search from tau what are your thoughts on blue light filtering glasses
[5428.80 → 5437.32] I think that they seem to filter some of the blue light and that there seems to be some evidence that
[5437.32 → 5443.32] that could be good how good um whether it's worth the money or the inconvenience of wearing glasses if
[5443.32 → 5450.10] you don't already need them that I don't know I personally don't bother with them um
[5450.10 → 5456.80] yeah no me neither and that's I thought they were fascinating when I first heard them me too
[5456.80 → 5463.28] um I tried them and then I tried them and seemed like they might help a little, but it's its so hard
[5463.28 → 5469.88] to tell like it's so hard to tell because there's no way to run a controlled experiment to know if they're
[5469.88 → 5476.36] working for you, it's all completely subjective really hard to trial as far as I know as well
[5477.08 → 5485.44] from max any updates on the spammer you called last week no I got a message back from them and then I was
[5485.44 → 5493.72] lazy they asked me to send them the comment that and I was like oh I could go check the wan archive and i
[5493.72 → 5499.40] could go find the and I could go into my YouTube dashboard and I could go look for that comment
[5499.40 → 5506.32] but it's my weekend so I didn't I'm sorry I know I said I would because they want to rope you and they
[5506.32 → 5513.04] want you to they want to get you to do things for them yeah that is not difficult to do and then
[5513.04 → 5517.86] eventually the next because you there 's's this like mental concept thing
[5517.86 → 5523.68] whereas as you do tasks for people and as people do tasks for you there's like trust built
[5523.68 → 5530.14] oh okay regardless basically of what the task is so am I just too lazy to get scammed in this case
[5530.14 → 5535.34] yeah I guess so nice yeah nice
[5535.34 → 5545.64] from anon my 16-month internship at AMD has shown me the fact that pc hardware is insanely complex and
[5545.64 → 5550.26] is a miracle that it works yeah is there anything about CPU or GPU design that is just black magic
[5550.26 → 5554.56] to you, and you would love to know how it works is designed etc all of it I was going to say the whole
[5554.56 → 5560.02] thing I love if it's super cool it's its one of those things where I'm I know I'm not smart enough
[5560.02 → 5566.28] to make it so I just sit here and publicly love it lots that's literally my job
[5566.28 → 5576.86] yeah from those bagels what did you think of devour's CPU contact frame and would you suggest it to
[5576.86 → 5584.92] others or is it snake oil asks this bagel uh I don't think Roman would ever try to sell anyone's
[5584.92 → 5591.92] snake oil and yes it works it does what he says it do I don't know that I would recommend it just
[5591.92 → 5599.68] because it will void your warranty assuming you tell anybody you used it um so i you know I don't
[5599.68 → 5605.22] want to I don't want to take a position on that, but we have validated on multiple instances using
[5605.22 → 5611.84] different kinds of coolers that it does in fact work cool or haha
[5611.84 → 5618.18] but yeah debater is legit he's not going to sell you oops I accidentally curated the wrong thing
[5618.18 → 5623.72] uh do we have any more topics we want to talk about I don't really know let's let's skim through
[5623.72 → 5628.08] I could talk about some of the cool lab stuff that's in that video I think they should watch the
[5628.08 → 5633.78] video yeah they can but like the automated game benchmarking the automated like keyboard tester
[5633.78 → 5641.90] dude out of a jig yeah watch the video yeah man we're going to be able to test like okay did you know
[5641.90 → 5647.72] that active noise-cancelling headphones will compensate if you're wearing glasses and there's like
[5647.72 → 5654.92] whoa no I didn't have that your base response sucks huh yeah they have like pressure sensors or something
[5654.92 → 5659.98] no, but they have a microphone inside so if they figure out hey we're not getting enough bass in
[5659.98 → 5666.88] here they'll boost it huh so cool right smart when you really start diving into the like the
[5666.88 → 5672.46] engineering of things it gets you yeah it's its that whole like you don't know enough to know that
[5672.46 → 5684.46] you don't know enough concept holy crap what we're announcing the whale land event yeah okay July 29th
[5684.46 → 5692.56] 6 p.m to July 31st 10 a.m you heard it here first there will be approximately 200 tickets available
[5692.56 → 5700.10] they will go live later next week the location will be new lab or lab 2 depending on which name you
[5700.10 → 5708.18] prefer for it so just right near the office here uh there will be Linus power hour game of the hour
[5708.18 → 5714.46] oh okay events include Linus power hour so game of the hour when you have no choice but to play the
[5714.46 → 5718.78] game that I decide is an hour long enough yeah I think so because there's setup time right
[5718.78 → 5726.26] it'll start like we'll figure it out I think an hour is long enough as long as we're actually
[5726.26 → 5729.54] playing for an hour are you are these like back to back like how does the
[5729.54 → 5734.92] Linus power no there will be gaps of do whatever you want in between Linus okay sweet then it's
[5734.92 → 5739.34] then it's great there will also be tournaments and challenges for prizes I want to cast a rocket
[5739.34 → 5742.68] league tournament there will be food and drink options you should let you should let chase know
[5742.68 → 5748.16] then yeah uh there will be a ltdstore.com merch booth maybe some other booths and members of our team
[5748.16 → 5755.22] will be at the event um I don't know that any of them will be like paid to be there so I can't
[5755.22 → 5760.68] guarantee that they'll be there or that they will stay or whatever else if it's boring then you'll
[5760.68 → 5767.18] have to just excuse them for off and going home um they may decide to sleep at home because they
[5767.18 → 5773.38] live around here or whatever else I'm going to stay as much as I can but yeah i I don't I'm not quite
[5773.38 → 5777.72] the whippersnapper I once was I don't think I'm going to be able to stay up on Friday morning when I have
[5777.72 → 5782.50] to start work do wan show and everything and then stay all the way up until Sunday at 10 a.m I might
[5782.50 → 5787.18] have been able to do that at one time yeah no not now if I do that now I'll be I'll be out for
[5787.18 → 5792.06] like two weeks no i would like I would definitely come down with something yeah exactly i
[5792.06 → 5798.46] reached a point around 25 I guess where i just I started getting a sick every time I pulled an
[5798.46 → 5802.28] all-nighter every single time Nixon would be like look are you not seeing the pattern here I'm
[5802.28 → 5810.40] like no I have no pattern I can't do that anyway super exciting I asked the float plane the local
[5810.40 → 5814.08] float plane guys I'll extend it to the rest of them but I asked the local float plane guys like
[5814.08 → 5820.12] hey do you guys want to go in they're like yes so they'll be there which is going to be cool yeah that
[5820.12 → 5826.78] could be a problem what we have 80 employees and approximately 200 seats at this land are we even
[5826.78 → 5834.70] going to sell any tickets I think there's I think there's 50 reserved okay all right cool well that's
[5834.70 → 5839.80] good like I don't mean out of the 200 I mean I believe our actual maximum capacity is 250
[5839.80 → 5845.66] okay, okay all right people are saying that they don't they can't get off work and travel with
[5845.66 → 5851.74] that little notice um don't take this the wrong way but we kind of did that on purpose this is not Ltd
[5851.74 → 5860.24] no this is not a worth travelling for spectacle wait for Ltd if you're not local this is intended for
[5860.24 → 5867.04] people who are at most maybe driving up from Seattle AJ asked can we play from the main LTT office
[5867.04 → 5873.12] what you're just going to like hide no you're going to fly all the way over here and then hide in a
[5873.12 → 5879.90] separate building play World of Warcraft over in the office while everyone else is no yeah world of
[5879.90 → 5887.08] warcraft will be banned we should do we should do like some form of like uh router rules that
[5887.08 → 5892.84] block certain like MMOs and stuff, and it's just like no you need to play land games I'd be super
[5892.84 → 5900.34] I'd be super extra down yeah anything else we oh yeah there was the whole uh the m2 MacBook Pro
[5900.34 → 5906.64] teardown confirms it's basically a m1 I fixed it tore down a m2 MacBook Pro in a recent video
[5906.64 → 5912.10] cables standoff screws grounding pins etc all the same uh the logic board though is a little different
[5912.10 → 5917.78] and supports the m2 chip uh the one the heat sink has square corners rather than rounded ones
[5917.78 → 5923.48] ooh the only major change aside from the chip is actually a downgrade the storage on the entry level
[5923.48 → 5929.04] m2 is slower than the m1 due to uh the different configuration of the SSD so it has fewer NAND chips
[5929.04 → 5935.14] which means that reading and writing in parallel is no longer possible this is only true for the base
[5935.14 → 5939.64] model though this is the part that I thought was interesting sounds like you should be able to take an
[5939.64 → 5947.38] m2 board and just stuff it into your m1 MacBook Pro right wrong I fix it tried this and made the swap
[5947.38 → 5954.22] successfully but the trackpad keyboard and touch id sensor no longer functioned post swap thank you Tim
[5954.22 → 5963.48] apple very cool discussion question here why would apple so blatantly and unnecessarily block repairability
[5963.48 → 5971.32] if someone had a failed logic board in a m1 MacBook Pro why couldn't they just put a m2 logic
[5971.32 → 5978.28] board in there hooked up to their old battery and screen and everything else because f**k you yeah
[5978.28 → 5981.54] that's pretty much if there 's's really nothing other than they just want you to buy
[5981.54 → 5988.62] new computers that that's it hey yeah yeah yeah I could get into it, I could get more mad, but that's
[5988.62 → 5993.32] that's all that is coming down to you, they don't care if you waste a bunch of stuff they want you to
[5993.32 → 6003.06] buy new computers also sort of relatively breaking news uh as expected Elon Musk pulled out of his
[6003.06 → 6009.58] twitter purchase deal and is getting a lot of much sued by a twins yeah
[6009.58 → 6017.60] I don't know if you read the story either uh let's just talk about the twitter thing though i I didn't
[6017.60 → 6022.12] know anything about this uh until you mentioned it when you first allegedly twins
[6022.12 → 6028.30] let's just say allegedly everything um but yeah allegedly he's trying to pull out of this
[6028.30 → 6034.50] twitter deal and then twitter was like we will bring legal action blah blah blah yeah you must buy us
[6034.50 → 6042.98] yeah or at the very least boy could he ever get sued for a lot because on the one hand I think the
[6042.98 → 6047.48] it's like stock manipulation there's a pullout yeah there's a pullout clause of the deal that would
[6047.48 → 6052.68] cost him a billion but then twitter could also probably sue for very significant damages because
[6052.68 → 6061.04] of all the stock uh price movement that has taken place all the um the sort of intangible damage
[6061.04 → 6068.34] that has been done by employees leaving and um just general unrest at Twitter that's taken place because
[6068.34 → 6077.52] of this whole saga this is going to be this is going to be interesting there are some folks jumping
[6077.52 → 6082.98] into uh chat saying well they lied on their numbers so he would win anyway yeah it's not going to be that
[6082.98 → 6091.94] straightforward boys going to be a pretty complicated one wait musk pulled out he recently tweeted letting
[6091.94 → 6097.04] everyone know he's not pulling out any more sorry what is this I'm seeing news articles from 40 minutes
[6097.04 → 6104.10] ago saying that he pulled out uh I don't even know what his twitter handle when we're just using
[6104.10 → 6110.20] it's probably just Elon Musk well it probably is except oh yeah it is okay when we're when we're
[6110.20 → 6115.50] just using the term pull out this gets a little confusing based on recent musk news yeah I know right
[6115.50 → 6122.92] because he was also tweeting recently about like doing his part for the U.S. uh birth rate yes so like if
[6122.92 → 6129.36] people are referring to that like yeah maybe you know maybe he's still all up in their stay classy
[6129.36 → 6136.98] Elon all right and you guys stay classy until we see you next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[6136.98 → 6144.70] how are we going to deal with wan and the land wan land yeah we're going to do it from there, or we're
[6144.70 → 6147.34] going to do it from here and then just go over there oh yeah we'll do it here
[6147.34 → 6167.02] oh hold on a second we can't end just yet sierras 13 asks at Luke hammer update
[6167.02 → 6175.46] I can look you should look the last time I looked it had been over a year and there was no update so
[6175.46 → 6186.58] this is going to take me like a while I can just check for next show okay yeah I'll check for next
[6186.58 → 6192.02] show, but there's almost certainly no update I think it might actually be abandoned now, but we'll see
[6192.02 → 6195.78] this thing going to like work at all or oh there we go
