[0.00 --> 6.96]  just don't cut the feed no matter what happens test your bleep button and we're live
[6.96 --> 12.54]  welcome to the show everyone we have fantastic topics this week including
[12.54 --> 18.94]  linus hopefully staying alive throughout the entire show um linus potentially apologizing
[18.94 --> 25.16]  uh or at least clarifying some comments was i wrong about elon musk let's talk about that
[25.16 --> 31.34]  more at 11. i'm definitely going to be talking about the big update on the uh fraudulent the wire
[31.34 --> 36.82]  fraud that yvonne and i were victims of yeah uh maybe as part of that i can give you guys some
[36.82 --> 43.50]  updates on the house and the pool and all of that good stuff because uh yeah that was it was it was
[43.50 --> 50.10]  the pool uh contractor that was ultimately the problem what else we got today uh but but tim cook
[50.10 --> 55.12]  hates sideloading which is uh basically a continuation of a topic that we've talked about a few
[55.12 --> 59.94]  times yeah it's not exactly news but it's uh definitely something that's in the news right
[59.94 --> 68.42]  now and also hey honda screw you man yeah i'm actually so annoyed about this uh what is my
[68.42 --> 70.42]  stream deck doing how do i show the intro
[70.42 --> 83.92]  what happened there we go uh i think you can press it now can i press it hey
[83.92 --> 110.38]  the show is brought to you by ovh cloud squarespace and vulture it's a vulture filter i never know how to
[110.38 --> 118.46]  pronounce it let's jump right into our first topic it's story time ladies and gentlemen i am ready now
[118.46 --> 124.36]  that it is resolved to give you guys the full update on what happened with the wire fraud for
[124.36 --> 130.64]  those of you who haven't caught either the clip or the original wandshow basically yvonne and i
[130.64 --> 137.44]  got tricked i mean there's really there's really no other way to put it because if we had proper
[137.44 --> 146.02]  procedures in place but yeah we could have avoided accidentally sending i don't believe i have talked
[146.02 --> 155.44]  to you guys yet about the amount but it was 90 000 canadian dollars yeah dang had i told you that before
[155.44 --> 161.32]  yeah i did okay i did tell you that before the show so 90 grand they got us for and you might be
[161.32 --> 169.24]  thinking linus you know how could you guys be that stupid to wire 90 000 to someone without verifying who
[169.24 --> 180.58]  they were and the answer is we did not consider you know that you're only as secure as the security of
[180.58 --> 187.14]  your business associates the weakest link right and so this particular contractor company i'm not gonna
[187.14 --> 192.82]  i'm not gonna name and shame it's not it's not what i'm about as a general rule when it comes to my
[192.82 --> 199.78]  personal dealings and this was personal money which if you're familiar with how taxes work is actually a
[199.78 --> 206.42]  lot more painful than losing business money if i lose ninety thousand dollars through the business
[206.42 --> 214.10]  business that's ninety thousand dollars if i lose ninety thousand dollars personally that's the ninety
[214.10 --> 220.18]  thousand dollars that remains after i earned about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars and paid a whole
[220.18 --> 226.90]  bunch of it in taxes to the provincial and federal canadian governments so losing ninety thousand dollars
[226.90 --> 233.22]  personally is a lot worse uh for our american friends watching that's somewhere in the neighborhood of
[233.22 --> 243.14]  around sixty five to seventy thousand us dollars so what happened was their email was compromised to
[243.14 --> 249.86]  the point where we were exchanging emails back and forth over a span of multiple days emails were coming
[249.86 --> 257.38]  back to us in the style uh documents on the letterhead because they had been in this company's email system for
[257.38 --> 263.14]  probably quite some time collecting information about their clients looking at the communication styles of their
[263.14 --> 271.54]  different employees and they offered us a deal where if we paid for all the remaining landscaping and
[271.54 --> 278.66]  pool work up front they would offer us it was either a 10 or a 15 discount i can't remember exactly and
[278.66 --> 287.14]  yvonne and i were in such a position in the project where we were like okay um our our personal cash flow is
[287.14 --> 292.50]  actually okay right now this is all money that we know we're like we've set aside to pay for in the next
[292.50 --> 298.50]  three to six months anyway we've got it yeah i mean if there's a discount let's do a discount so we
[298.50 --> 303.54]  figured out the terms of how it was going to work and they had us they had us wire it to them and they
[303.54 --> 309.06]  had a convincing story for why the wire was going to a bank in toronto which is in canada it's not like
[309.06 --> 316.50]  they had to send it to a bank in you know i don't know syria or nigeria or something right like it was
[316.50 --> 323.14]  going to a canadian bank france so we sent the money and a little while later we got contacted
[323.14 --> 331.22]  by the contractor who in my opinion um did not do a good enough job of letting us know right away
[332.02 --> 340.74]  they should have told us immediately because you can typically recall a wire within the first 24 to 36
[340.74 --> 347.78]  hours after that who does it ever get tougher because if they withdraw that money if their
[347.78 --> 353.70]  account has it's basically handing people cash yeah it's a wire transfer cash money yeah so once it's
[353.70 --> 363.62]  moved out of the bank that it was sent to it's gone yes i'm talking about a scam i was defrauded for
[363.62 --> 374.10]  90 000 canadian dollars okay so i am ready to provide and this part i don't know on what happened
[374.10 --> 381.70]  so the first thing that we did obviously was we got in touch with our bank and our bank basically said
[383.46 --> 390.66]  like it's it's been like over two days what what do you want us to do we sent the money and we're like
[390.66 --> 397.46]  we're like what we want you to do is tell us what to do yeah because i'm sure this isn't the first time
[397.46 --> 404.58]  it's come up yeah and they said contact law enforcement now i am generally pretty supportive
[404.58 --> 413.70]  of law enforcement um i think that there are a lot of bad eggs i think there are a lot of bad eggs in
[413.70 --> 421.30]  any profession you could go to lawyers teachers law enforcement sports coaches and you could find
[422.18 --> 431.94]  pedophiles murderers monsters um i do think that in positions of power people have tendencies that
[431.94 --> 439.06]  might bring out worse aspects of their personality so i'm not going to say that there is no correlation
[439.06 --> 447.38]  between people who abuse authority and authoritative figures so i will say that much but by and large
[447.38 --> 455.30]  i am i i i understand that it is a job that actually does need to be done anarchy is not better yeah um
[458.02 --> 464.66]  but things are the royal canadian mounted police were utterly useless i think that's pretty normal yeah in
[464.66 --> 473.22]  this situation and i get it when you call the cops to your house because your 200 stereo was stolen um
[473.22 --> 480.34]  there is a there's a certain degree of what do you what do you want me to do about this it's it's it's
[480.34 --> 486.18]  literally less than your insurance deductible and the cost of me doing paperwork to report this like i'm
[486.18 --> 493.78]  sorry this this bad thing happened and that sucks you know i'd love to i can help you commiserate but
[493.78 --> 500.02]  realistically putting actual law enforcement resources into dealing with this petty crime is
[500.90 --> 506.34]  probably a a bigger waste of taxpayer dollars than even me standing here and explaining it to you
[506.34 --> 512.98]  like i i understand that perspective even if i am very frustrated by it and that is a situation that i
[512.98 --> 519.38]  have in fact been in and yes maria z 200 is a lot of money for most people you're right and it was for
[519.38 --> 527.30]  me when my car window got smashed and my stereo got taken but ultimately i also understand the cost
[528.10 --> 536.50]  of investigating this crime is much greater than 200 so in the big picture i like kind of get it
[536.50 --> 549.06]  but we are talking about 90 000 and you are telling me that it is not even worth i don't know picking up a
[549.06 --> 557.06]  phone and calling a canadian bank who presumably would actually cooperate with you if you did the
[557.06 --> 564.34]  paperwork like you are supposed to no dude is it's oh yeah you know what yeah that's rough too busy doing
[564.34 --> 570.90]  speeding that's rough afraid we can't do anything about that are you kidding me i mean maybe i've
[570.90 --> 578.82]  watched too many movies right read too many thrillers but it seems to me that if the money went to a
[578.82 --> 586.90]  canadian bank a canadian person somewhere is going to have to retrieve it at some point and it would
[586.90 --> 594.50]  probably be a pretty good idea to find them and put them in jail no someone probably registered that
[594.50 --> 600.42]  bank account they might have also like identity theft you know jacked a bank account sure well then
[600.42 --> 605.70]  that person should probably know their identity was stolen instead of us just ignoring it was one thing
[605.70 --> 611.78]  allowing it to continue is like by investigating smaller crimes you might uh unveil someone that's
[611.78 --> 616.66]  doing an extremely large amount of smaller crimes but that's uh it's not always going to work
[618.42 --> 626.82]  but yeah so nothing so nicola run says no no no and no every crime has to be investigated i mean
[626.82 --> 638.10]  so like what are you doing yeah i mean i think that's a pretty good example fund philosophically i
[638.10 --> 645.54]  guess you know we could debate this but i live in the real world where if luke steals that pen
[645.54 --> 652.18]  realistically dude the only consequence is going to be me calling him out when we finally do an intel
[652.18 --> 661.62]  extreme tech upgrade um the point is that there actually are different tiers of criminal liability
[661.62 --> 669.46]  depending on the severity i would prefer that more more time went into investigating like murders and
[670.34 --> 675.94]  and other things i don't even necessarily want to bring up then investigated like the gameboy that
[675.94 --> 681.94]  was stolen from me when i was like 12. i was really sad that heavily impacted me at that age
[681.94 --> 689.14]  yep but it's it's genuinely just not as important as certain other things so you know man oh man i
[689.14 --> 693.70]  see i'm trying i don't want to have i don't want any hot takes today but we're already there yeah i know
[693.70 --> 698.58]  i guess i guess we're already there it's like hot zone ladies and gentlemen it's like uh you know for
[698.58 --> 705.94]  for me how's that classist for me life is your life is is essentially all of the time that you have
[705.94 --> 714.74]  combined right and the way that i see it the severity of a crime is directly uh is directly
[714.74 --> 722.74]  correlated not not not necessarily one for one but is correlated with the amount of that time that it
[722.74 --> 730.50]  steals or that it that it robs someone else of so obviously from from that from that perspective
[730.50 --> 738.66]  the murder of an infant child could be considered to be the worst crime because you have robbed that
[738.66 --> 745.94]  entire undefined potential life and accomplishment what could have been contributed contributed to the
[745.94 --> 752.82]  world okay not only have you done that but you have also probably damaged or completely destroyed the
[752.82 --> 759.22]  lives of the parents and the other family members who brought that child into the world and the greater the
[759.22 --> 764.18]  magnitude of this destruction of life the worse it is that's sort of my general philosophy and
[764.74 --> 770.34]  from frau and you can you can kind of take pretty much anything whether it's whether it's rape
[770.34 --> 775.78]  or whether it's theft and you can bring it to time if you steal a hundred dollars from someone
[775.78 --> 781.62]  who works minimum wage you have stolen a day you stole a day of their life is the way that i see it or more i think
[782.66 --> 789.06]  uh uh it depends where you are yeah i think it's 14 something way too low basically everywhere
[789.38 --> 799.78]  um bc minimum wage 15 1565 so yeah my math is about right so you have you have essentially stolen a day
[799.78 --> 808.58]  of that person's life from my point of view and so it's really it's really frustrating to me particularly
[808.58 --> 815.70]  financial crimes are a big one when someone steals like a billion dollars to me that is an enormous deal
[815.70 --> 821.86]  like you have actually you have actually stolen the waking hours of hundreds or thousands upon
[821.86 --> 828.82]  thousands of people that they will never have back they chose to spend that time earning money you took
[828.82 --> 835.70]  it therefore they spent that time earning nothing and that has that has a psychological toll as well
[836.50 --> 841.06]  as well as just that time that's lost so that's that's the way that i see it and when someone is
[841.06 --> 850.50]  conducting this kind of scam not only have they taken an extremely large amount of labor created wealth
[851.06 --> 856.18]  but they're probably doing it to others in fact we know for a fact they tried to do it to others because
[856.18 --> 862.02]  they accessed the systems of this contractor and we were not people at the same time the only ones they
[862.02 --> 868.50]  hit yeah and so to me it was outrageous that they kind of looked at it and went we're we're not going to
[868.50 --> 873.62]  do anything about this so that makes it more interesting to me because like i mentioned with
[873.62 --> 880.50]  the uh the stereo example like by investigating that one you might find that that is a a not a
[880.50 --> 884.98]  single occurrence right no and if they stole stereos from like hundreds of people then okay this is a
[884.98 --> 890.90]  really big deal and that but they do actually do that oh yeah like i you know obviously i'm in like
[890.90 --> 895.86]  my neighborhood watch facebook try to notice stuff like that so so obviously i'm not saying you shouldn't
[895.86 --> 900.42]  continue to report crimes even if you know they're not going to investigate we go out of our way even
[900.42 --> 904.18]  if we know they're not going to do anything to make sure that we report everything whether it's through
[904.18 --> 909.94]  the business or whether it's personally because like you said once they start to notice these patterns
[909.94 --> 913.94]  actually they do apprehend like petty criminals quite often so
[917.70 --> 925.06]  i was very frustrated by the response from both our bank who i didn't expect to be able to do anything
[925.06 --> 930.98]  but i hoped would be able to these are next steps i yeah i hoped would it didn't go to nowhere it went
[930.98 --> 937.94]  to a canadian bank account therefore somebody has to get it at some point right so let's figure out who
[937.94 --> 945.46]  that is find out if they've been defrauded or had their identity stolen right find out who they're
[945.46 --> 951.22]  cooperating with there's got to be some way to track this money as it moves whether it's within the
[951.22 --> 957.14]  country or around the world i thought that's the whole point of a centralized banking system no
[958.58 --> 965.86]  isn't it yeah sorry aren't there like actual anti-money laundering and anti-fraud laws and and
[965.86 --> 971.06]  policies and procedures in place aren't there mechanisms for finding out where money came from
[971.06 --> 978.82]  and where it went isn't it all electronic how is it even possible that we can't figure out who it
[978.82 --> 985.46]  went to yeah kind of nuts it is kind of nuts i was stunned locked there for a second because someone
[985.46 --> 992.50]  told me to look up the the minimum wage in georgia and wyoming and i was like okay and they're
[992.50 --> 999.38]  apparently five dollars and fifteen cents but there's a there's a federal uh fair labor standards act which
[999.38 --> 1006.98]  means that they have to pay the federal minimum wage which is seven dollars and 25 cents 58 for an
[1006.98 --> 1017.38]  eight-hour work day okay dang if we want to start talking about raising the american minimum wage we
[1017.38 --> 1023.54]  are going to end up in hot take territory extremely quickly all i'm saying is it's far from 100 bucks but
[1023.54 --> 1029.46]  yeah um and when you're a lot closer to 100 canadian dollars you're saying that's true that's true
[1030.10 --> 1035.06]  when you only make 58 bucks the the distance to 100 bucks is going to feel extremely far
[1035.62 --> 1041.54]  um yep but anyway anyways yeah so so it didn't work you didn't get it back so
[1043.86 --> 1047.22]  what happened was i am lucky enough
[1047.22 --> 1054.66]  i am lucky enough in my life and the personal contacts that i have okay that i was able to reach
[1055.54 --> 1063.38]  someone who knows someone who has some kind of connection at the financial institution that received
[1064.02 --> 1064.50]  the money
[1067.46 --> 1070.82]  they were not supposed to find out if it was still there and tell me
[1070.82 --> 1083.38]  oh my okay got it i think i understand are we stopping there what happened okay was somehow
[1083.38 --> 1088.74]  and i have no idea how this occurred the money was frozen in the recipient's account
[1090.50 --> 1098.18]  while an investigation was conducted okay we got it back two days ago wow not by the rcmp so there's
[1098.18 --> 1104.10]  no police involvement not as far as i'm aware just the banks uh i i don't know the exact mechanism so
[1104.10 --> 1107.94]  it could be that the police did end up being involved i imagine they might have been involved
[1107.94 --> 1116.34]  at some point what i suspect is that our our own provincial rcmp or municipal detachment or whatever
[1116.34 --> 1122.02]  didn't feel like dealing with something over provincial lines so once it was flagged by an organization
[1122.02 --> 1127.38]  in the same province that the crime appeared to have been committed it may have actually received
[1127.38 --> 1133.94]  some proper attention but the bigger problem here the bigger problem is that that's what it that's
[1133.94 --> 1139.94]  what it took exactly anyone this before anyone whether they were defrauded of a hundred dollars
[1140.58 --> 1149.22]  fifty dollars a hundred thousand dollars should be able to figure out where that that fraudulent
[1149.22 --> 1158.02]  transaction went and this should not be complicated in the digital age yeah how is that even possible
[1160.82 --> 1163.78]  yeah and it shouldn't like any time that it takes
[1165.06 --> 1170.82]  the public influence that that one of us has in order to fix a problem the system's broken yes a hundred
[1170.82 --> 1176.18]  percent yeah yeah it's not good like i'm happy for you that it was solved but also
[1176.18 --> 1183.38]  that's like that's still big bad um at least you you got that should i transition here go for it at
[1183.38 --> 1189.78]  least you got that money back because now you can afford to buy uh an nft that was originally
[1190.50 --> 1196.74]  2.9 million dollars but now as far as my understanding goes is only 6 800 bucks
[1196.74 --> 1202.42]  it's amazing you got your 90 grand back you've got way more than enough money to buy this nft that is
[1202.42 --> 1210.82]  definitely worth uh almost three million dollars can i just say can i just say that i was delighted to
[1210.82 --> 1218.98]  read this headline this is great this is so funny okay this is the this uh original article is from the
[1218.98 --> 1224.74]  guardian here massive props the guardian love you guys i need to donate i haven't yet i really should
[1224.74 --> 1234.66]  uh this is the mona lisa of the digital world says crypto entrepreneur cena estavi who bought the nft in
[1234.66 --> 1244.98]  march of 2021 2.9 million dollars for an nft of jack dorsey's first tweet which to be clear guys it is
[1244.98 --> 1254.58]  non-fungible okay this cannot simply be replicated by right clicking and save as oh geez it's non-fungible
[1254.58 --> 1263.62]  oh man inspect element type it in yourself beautiful and you know the last thing you would want is to
[1263.62 --> 1269.94]  spend 2.9 million dollars on on a fungible token if you could have a non-fungible one
[1273.06 --> 1280.74]  so he bought it in march 2021 because this is definitely a very valuable sensible asset one of my
[1280.74 --> 1285.70]  favorite quotes in here is when he's when he's putting it up for sale he says it's important
[1287.38 --> 1292.02]  have you read this it's sorry this is actually just amazing and it's it's almost difficult to get
[1292.02 --> 1298.74]  through it's important for me who wants to buy it i will not sell this nft to anyone because i do not
[1298.74 --> 1307.30]  think everyone deserves this nft it's a picture of a tweet okay and this is great come on so he bought it in
[1307.30 --> 1315.86]  march 2021 for 2.9 million dollars but apparently his efforts to resell it regardless of who's actually
[1315.86 --> 1325.46]  allowed to bid have apparently been uh pretty unsuccessful so far with a top bid of just six
[1325.46 --> 1332.02]  thousand eight hundred dollars nice which is a lot of money but compared to 2.9 million
[1332.02 --> 1337.46]  like literally doesn't change the number it's still 2.9 million that he's losing
[1339.78 --> 1349.94]  amazing oh man oh man yeah conrad's like give you 350 for it best i can do i just
[1351.70 --> 1360.26]  i find it i okay with cryptocurrency we are actually in the process of trying to figure out a way to
[1360.26 --> 1366.74]  accept cryptocurrency for some of our products and services i think that cryptocurrency does have
[1367.54 --> 1375.06]  the potential to have a value i i think that with refinement it can be an amazing technology a force
[1375.06 --> 1383.94]  for change maybe a force for good in the world that much i can say nfts yeah i don't know there it's just
[1383.94 --> 1392.18]  there's such a blatantly obvious drift i think there's also probably utility there as well sure
[1392.18 --> 1397.30]  i think it just essentially has like maybe if there's if there's i don't even know if there has
[1397.30 --> 1401.06]  been because i haven't looked into it enough but maybe there's some amount of utility that's already
[1401.06 --> 1405.54]  being used for it that's actually legit and then like 90 of the scams let's talk about the dumb stuff
[1405.54 --> 1411.62]  the games industry is doing with nfts right so nfts one of the big pitches that i've heard for nfts in
[1411.62 --> 1417.70]  gaming is that you can have an nft of say some digital artwork that could even be transported
[1417.70 --> 1424.98]  across games games right okay except here's the problem with that what's the difference between
[1424.98 --> 1437.14]  having it centralized and stored on valve servers or uh ea servers or ubisoft servers or nintendo's servers
[1437.14 --> 1442.66]  or whatever the case may be what's the value of having it stored somewhere else or having this
[1442.66 --> 1449.86]  token if ultimately the exact same actions that could cause it to stop working uh like if that
[1449.86 --> 1455.94]  that particular game it shuts down or whatever right so they delete your your your digital item
[1456.50 --> 1460.18]  would also cause it to stop working because now you just own a digital item for a game they shut down
[1460.18 --> 1466.10]  like what's the difference also also real chads just don't buy any skins whether you can transfer
[1466.10 --> 1473.46]  them to game to game or not it's true so you you don't need it anyways no utility just don't buy it
[1473.46 --> 1482.50]  it's true the day i i i'm i'm making a promise i'm making a commitment right now the day that one of my
[1482.50 --> 1491.94]  kids spends money on a on a digital on a digital thing to look at they're off the computer for a
[1491.94 --> 1498.42]  quarter for a quarter for a quarter for a kid that's a long it's a long time they will learn that's a long
[1498.42 --> 1505.70]  and they will learn a value i remember like if i got grounded for like a month it felt like an eternity
[1506.42 --> 1510.74]  that's a that's a that's a minute one one more thing before we get off this topic um
[1510.74 --> 1518.18]  um he said okay it's not a he said while announcing the nft sale in a tweet on the 6th of april
[1518.18 --> 1525.62]  as davi pledged to give 50 of the proceeds which he expected to be at least 25 million dollars
[1528.66 --> 1534.82]  to charity oh hey thanks thanks for the hypothetical money for your hypothetical asset
[1534.82 --> 1542.02]  so good oh man i mean if you're gonna spend money you should at least actually get something in
[1542.02 --> 1554.58]  return why don't we head over to lttstore.com we have actually got some very good stuff this week
[1554.58 --> 1560.42]  first of all guys if you want a merch message to show up so those are those little messages that show
[1560.42 --> 1565.94]  up uh at the bottom of the stream ooh as long as i'm not in a window like this have we thought of
[1565.94 --> 1572.90]  that luke do merch messages do anything when we're like this no they do not oh uh okay uh well uh
[1572.90 --> 1577.54]  hopefully you didn't send them just need the banners to be added to these now yeah i guess we'll need
[1577.54 --> 1582.10]  to do that okay cool we'll figure that out later anyway if you pick something up on the store while
[1582.10 --> 1588.90]  we're streaming you will get a chance to fill in a merch message and it'll either pop up or our producer
[1588.90 --> 1593.38]  will reply to you or we might address it on the show and we've got a couple of cool things for
[1593.38 --> 1601.22]  you guys to check out uh sarah could not resist the urge to create a egg shell t-shirt yeah what
[1601.22 --> 1609.06]  what is this and oh from the paint rant oh this is gonna be really cool we're actually doing something
[1609.06 --> 1615.14]  special with this shirt this is a pre-sale so we are going to print only the exact number of shirts
[1615.14 --> 1619.54]  that we order so this is a digital reference mock-up that sarah did are you gonna damage the
[1620.66 --> 1630.18]  six of the shirts they will be randomly selected one of each size will not be eggshell
[1630.74 --> 1637.06]  they will be satin and they will be covered in little masking tape pieces just like the walls of
[1637.06 --> 1644.90]  my house there you go they will also come with a uh a note that i'm actually i'm gonna write it i'm
[1644.90 --> 1650.50]  gonna write it live on the show i'll create a note we're gonna do six copies okay then we're gonna like
[1650.50 --> 1657.78]  label them one of six two of six all the way to six of six and you will you will get an ugly
[1657.78 --> 1665.38]  an ugly stupid satin shirt and you will also get a little a little note that i i will write you here on
[1665.38 --> 1670.50]  the here on the show today that's amazing that that that that's it that's the big that's the big uh
[1670.50 --> 1677.30]  that's the big pitch so you might get you might get eggshell shirt or i might decide to screw you
[1677.30 --> 1684.18]  over with satin now actually ah i'm glad we're talking about this because some folks pointed out
[1684.18 --> 1692.10]  that um satin they said that it actually has more resin than eggshell maybe that's a regional thing
[1692.10 --> 1699.86]  because not only is every satin paint that i've ever seen here in canada uh more matte than eggshell
[1699.86 --> 1707.06]  but i actually checked the exact product they were using on the like master painter whatever
[1707.06 --> 1715.86]  organization thing that like rates paints and it's it's it's resin content its hardness was lower than
[1715.86 --> 1722.74]  an eggshell product from that same brand there's also some confusion interesting um in sherwin
[1722.74 --> 1726.18]  williams so that's the brand of paint that we're using i wish we'd just use cloverdale i'm much more
[1726.18 --> 1731.06]  comfortable with their products anyway there's some confusion in the way that sherwin williams labels
[1731.06 --> 1738.10]  their paint and they apparently do have some products where satin and eggshell are used interchangeably
[1738.10 --> 1745.14]  at least by them but as for whether they are actually the same uh that i don't know so there
[1745.14 --> 1752.02]  you go there you go by satin no by satin i mean the paint finish this was a rant that i did during a
[1752.02 --> 1758.82]  live stream and then we also uploaded as a clip to lmg clips yeah so if you guys uh if you guys want a
[1758.82 --> 1765.38]  an eggshell shirt then hey cool go for it the real product the not limited time one that we are actually
[1765.38 --> 1771.54]  launching is a really good one man we have been working on this one for far too long considering
[1771.54 --> 1779.78]  how of a sweater simple it looks on the surface it's a waffle like a waffle pattern fabric long
[1779.78 --> 1786.66]  sleeve shirt it's made of a hundred percent organic cotton super minimal ltt branding there's just a
[1786.66 --> 1792.58]  little tiny tag on the bottom you can you can barely even see it down here it's available in charcoal
[1792.58 --> 1802.66]  as well as ultramarine and man is this thing ever comfortable and breathable and it just i think
[1802.66 --> 1808.90]  man the fashion team just nailed this one i like a lot i'm also seeing some people in chat say weird
[1808.90 --> 1814.82]  timing um i sort of thought the same thing and that comes out when it comes out and then remembered that
[1814.82 --> 1823.46]  i i was out for a run yesterday and it was negative one degrees celsius outside so like maybe it's not
[1823.46 --> 1830.50]  i don't know really as a thing yeah like i you know just saying and it'll still be available when it's
[1830.50 --> 1837.06]  slightly less weird timing so who cares yeah it's it's it's great they they just they absolutely nailed
[1837.06 --> 1842.66]  it like it it manages to be like nice and fitted in the chest it hangs nicely uh but it's still it's like
[1842.66 --> 1849.70]  super stretchable oh yeah so like if you're if you're a little wider in the you know girthy parts
[1850.26 --> 1854.50]  then it can accommodate that as well so yeah we're really excited about this one
[1856.18 --> 1860.82]  real excited so you guys yeah you're gonna want to go check that out i don't know how many we have in
[1860.82 --> 1868.74]  stock but um wow okay apparently it works pretty well for for the ladies too that's sarah she manages to
[1868.74 --> 1874.66]  make anything look good look at that that's awesome oh yeah and of course you can mouse over
[1874.66 --> 1879.86]  and you can see who the who the model is and what size they're wearing so if you you know see a body
[1879.86 --> 1884.26]  type that you're like oh yeah that's um yeah i'm kind of like that it matches me a little bit better
[1884.26 --> 1890.18]  then you can person i'm shopping for you can scroll through all our pictures and get a good pretty good
[1890.18 --> 1900.34]  idea of how that's gonna fit on you all right let's move on shall we our next topic is called linus
[1900.34 --> 1909.54]  apologized to daddy elon okay i had some takes last week that were sort of half based on articles that i
[1909.54 --> 1915.22]  half read over the last five years some of which were a long time ago and the bottom line for me was
[1915.22 --> 1927.06]  that i don't think that elon musk is a particularly considerate and kind thoughtful uh person is is my
[1927.06 --> 1931.94]  take based on his public actions we were talking about him purchasing twitter so that doesn't and
[1931.94 --> 1941.46]  his willingness to uh his willingness to put his own desires above those of others unilaterally is sort
[1941.46 --> 1949.78]  of i guess how i could summarize it um basically being a douchebag right just kind of going yeah
[1949.78 --> 1954.98]  that's that's the way that i wanted and that last time everyone else can just i don't know not believe
[1954.98 --> 1962.42]  we're suck a popsicle so so basically we're gonna go through everything i talked about last week i had
[1962.42 --> 1968.90]  the i had the writing team go through and clarify some of the things i got wrong expand upon some of the
[1968.90 --> 1976.02]  things i got not so wrong and i'm just gonna kind of go through it here so uh misleading statements
[1976.02 --> 1982.66]  and or posturing around charity um and or you know hey look at that good thing i'm doing look at me i
[1982.66 --> 1988.02]  would like attention sort of actions so we've got the trapped thai kid situation uh this was the source
[1988.02 --> 1995.94]  of the whole pedo guy lawsuit um musk helps by sending a submarine okay so no i don't think this is
[1995.94 --> 2001.38]  entirely fair so the okay the pedo guy thing yeah is its own thing i don't want to address really
[2001.38 --> 2010.18]  stupid that was really stupid 100 i'm on board he was asked for help and he was asked to design a
[2010.18 --> 2016.34]  backup solution and he brought the thing there and then he left it with them and when the rescue was
[2016.34 --> 2021.38]  successful he said great job to the rescuers all that kind of stuff and then there was this fight that
[2021.38 --> 2027.62]  happened afterwards and he called the dude pedo guy or whatever but it was above board until then
[2027.62 --> 2034.90]  and the guy did lose the defamation suit but what does that probably because mean big big bank take
[2034.90 --> 2040.18]  little bank more than anything else i i don't know but yeah i know that guy was like attacking him first
[2040.18 --> 2047.22]  that doesn't make it okay um etc etc but like but saying but putting it in like helps is that's not fair
[2047.22 --> 2052.02]  he was asked to help and he helped donating ventilators this one was pretty funny to me
[2052.58 --> 2057.22]  early in the covid pandemic musk committed to donating ventilators to hospitals they turned out
[2057.22 --> 2063.62]  to be cpap machines which is not the same thing don't forget he was a covet denialist and in my opinion
[2063.62 --> 2071.38]  his behavior towards his workers during the pandemic was extremely anti-labor and when you are anti-labor you
[2071.38 --> 2082.98]  are anti basically 99 of people it's that simple um yeah not not cool at all starlink in ukraine so
[2082.98 --> 2088.82]  starlink worked with usa to send 5000 starlink terminals after ukrainian prime minister uh mikhael
[2090.02 --> 2094.98]  fedorov asked elon on twitter to activate satellites for use in ukraine to which elon replied starlink
[2094.98 --> 2100.74]  service is now active in ukraine yes they are satellites uh upon receiving the satellites fedorov thanked
[2100.74 --> 2105.70]  elon again on twitter probably the most effective charity to date they we've got hold on this is
[2105.70 --> 2112.98]  another uh this is another one i okay so if you look into this it was if i remember correctly the
[2112.98 --> 2118.34]  majority of the direct expenditure was from usaid there is some stuff that was thrown in from starlink
[2118.34 --> 2121.70]  though and if i remember correctly starlink is planning to support them for longer than
[2122.26 --> 2130.18]  usaid paid for etc etc etc all right uh lawsuit against the founder uh the lawsuit was reversed martin
[2130.18 --> 2135.46]  eberhard sued elon for libel slander and breach of contract it alleged that elon pushed eberhard out
[2135.46 --> 2140.34]  of the company the case was probably settled nothing was publicly disclosed um
[2144.26 --> 2147.70]  okay there's a bit of editorializing here but it's not mine so i'm gonna go with it
[2148.18 --> 2152.90]  uh horse's guess is that probably elon fired eberhard because he was mad about not being in the limelight as
[2152.90 --> 2158.50]  much as the co-founder uh there's a quote here from elon i'm not merely unmentioned in the new york
[2158.50 --> 2163.70]  times coverage but whereas martin is actually referred to as the chairman okay and we've got
[2163.70 --> 2170.42]  elon's treatment of his family so i don't have a ton of respect for people who don't treat their
[2170.42 --> 2176.02]  family well we don't have a ton of information about the kids other than that they have weird names
[2176.02 --> 2183.62]  that seem to be designed solely to get headlines um the kind of attention-seeking behavior honestly
[2183.62 --> 2191.46]  strikes me as extremely childish but that sort of is what it is as for your kid a weird name is like
[2192.50 --> 2198.42]  as for the whole treatment of sos uh vanity fair interview from march grimes complained about her
[2198.42 --> 2203.38]  poor living conditions um like bro wouldn't even get a new mattress there was a hole in her side of
[2203.38 --> 2210.26]  the bed uh he suggested they replace it with her mattress bro does not live like a billionaire uh why do we
[2210.26 --> 2214.26]  live in this insecure forty thousand dollar house where the neighbors like film us and there's no
[2214.26 --> 2219.06]  security and i'm eating peanut butter for eight days in a row she does frequently speak positively
[2219.06 --> 2224.50]  of elon um her admiration for his accomplishments plans for mars electric cars future of humanity etc
[2224.50 --> 2229.54]  still seems to be content having him in her life as for his first wife seems to be much less fond
[2229.54 --> 2234.98]  describes herself as a starter wife um filed for divorce then six weeks later got engaged to a second
[2234.98 --> 2242.10]  wife that usually doesn't happen unless there was some kind of lead up to it um elon took very little
[2242.10 --> 2245.94]  time before trying to ensure she would not be able to have any impact on his wealth in the form of
[2245.94 --> 2252.26]  post-nuptial agreements that's cool that's like that's partnership um i guess as someone who feels that
[2252.26 --> 2258.58]  a marriage is a partnership i i have zero respect for that kind of behavior um he would apparently
[2258.58 --> 2262.58]  continuously criticize her saying things like if you were my employee i would fire you
[2262.58 --> 2269.62]  um referred to her grief after losing their child to sidz as emotionally manipulated pressured her to dye
[2269.62 --> 2276.90]  her hair more blonde um oh this the sidz one is really brutal yeah there's just i mean again this is all
[2276.90 --> 2292.26]  alleged um but you know we've got anyway back to the twitter thing so yeah i'm i'm not a fan
[2293.14 --> 2299.46]  and you know what you can be but i don't have to be and i'm not my whole point on the clarifications and
[2299.46 --> 2306.90]  honestly just to be like completely real this doesn't fully satisfy my my desire for clarifications
[2306.90 --> 2314.74]  like a lot of these are are still editorialized as i would say like the trap kids thing yep that's
[2314.74 --> 2320.18]  fair that wasn't properly covered the satellites thing was not properly covered etc uh well thankfully we have
[2320.18 --> 2327.22]  you here thank you luke yeah hooray um if you're gonna attack people you should just do it properly
[2327.22 --> 2333.06]  that i'm not i'm not a fan that's fine i'm not a fan of elon i i had the same feedback for people back
[2333.06 --> 2338.82]  when trump was president of the united states and people used to just say like oh orange man bad it's
[2338.82 --> 2344.42]  like you're not you're not accomplishing anything if anything you're attacking that weekly is just like
[2344.42 --> 2351.14]  offering up you to be like parried more aggressively like just if you're gonna if you're gonna go at
[2351.14 --> 2356.34]  them just go for the throat so it's better like that it's better to yeah better to clarify and be
[2356.34 --> 2363.70]  able to back up your statements what so what do you think about the the attempt to purchase all of
[2363.70 --> 2376.42]  twitter for 43 true it's not trillion is it pretty sure that's a typo billion 43 billion um i find it
[2377.62 --> 2393.06]  i find it deeply ironic that there is a certain subset of um of people that are looking for saviors from
[2393.06 --> 2403.62]  the elite and turn to figures like donald trump and or elon musk the likes like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2404.34 --> 2415.86]  for sure these people's lives and experiences are nothing like yours they are actually the elite and
[2415.86 --> 2425.22]  if you are expecting someone who has so such disdain for the questions and commentary of others
[2425.22 --> 2431.94]  that they actually dissolved their press relations department for tesla so that they wouldn't have to
[2431.94 --> 2438.26]  answer uncomfortable questions if you imagine that kind of thin-skinned individual is going to be some
[2438.26 --> 2448.10]  kind of champion for free speech or for the rights of the people i i don't follow you i i'm sorry i can't
[2448.10 --> 2454.82]  go where you're going i expected this type of stuff to to get in the dock as well but there's there's
[2454.82 --> 2461.46]  examples of him trying to like squash or or or or at least heavily negatively reacting to free speech as
[2461.46 --> 2466.50]  well like there was some and uh this is fair are we going to talk about the private jet tracker or
[2466.50 --> 2470.90]  something else the private jet tracker is interesting sure is but that isn't what i was going to talk
[2470.90 --> 2477.22]  about um the private jet tracker guy by the way has has tweeted out talking about how like if elon
[2477.22 --> 2483.62]  buys twitter he feels like he's gonna get banned um but there's there's other stuff like i i should
[2483.62 --> 2489.62]  have prepared this for the show to make claims on it but um there's like i i believe there was a someone
[2489.62 --> 2496.42]  who wrote an article about tesla that he didn't like uh but they had like pre-purchased a model x or
[2496.42 --> 2502.82]  something so he canceled their order and it's just like like come on man like there's there's a lot of
[2502.82 --> 2510.98]  there's a lot of examples of like yeah and like man guys you know i see comments like well who's going
[2510.98 --> 2518.82]  to take on the elite other than the elite us everyone yeah everyone not the elite the elite are not going to
[2518.82 --> 2526.42]  save you replacing your your your your all-powerful god king with another all-powerful god king never
[2526.42 --> 2540.18]  worked for anyone no literally never worked it's bad news dude so um you know it's honestly it's it's
[2540.18 --> 2545.46]  hard for me it's hard for me to fathom because sometimes i think he's playing 4d chess and other
[2545.46 --> 2551.22]  other times i think he's just behaving like an actual child and trolling people on the internet
[2551.22 --> 2559.30]  so is he is this some kind of scheme to uh grossly increase the value of the nine point whatever
[2559.30 --> 2565.30]  percent stake that he already bought to make a quick buck is it honestly he does gamer moves like that all
[2565.30 --> 2571.22]  the time i wouldn't be surprised yeah yeah could be that is it just to is it just to be in the headlines
[2571.22 --> 2577.38]  because as far as i can tell he can't go 48 hours without just doing something so everybody's
[2577.38 --> 2582.58]  looking at him there's i've seen some claims that there's other stuff going on with him i don't know
[2583.22 --> 2588.42]  um like things that he's doing at his different companies that are bad i don't know i'm not informed
[2588.42 --> 2592.98]  on this and that he's trying to make splashes with this twitter thing to distract from it i don't know
[2592.98 --> 2602.90]  um dude uh dude uses social media stuff for for super gamer moves so yep i would be very sus of like
[2604.42 --> 2608.66]  i mean you should just be really suspicious of anything that anyone with that amount of power
[2608.66 --> 2615.30]  does ever people like boosting stocks is illegal yeah so was not disclosing in the correct amount of
[2615.30 --> 2621.14]  time that he had acquired the stake that he had acquired before but this is like this is what i'm talking
[2621.14 --> 2629.78]  about where for some reason that kind of white collar criminality doesn't get prosecuted you know
[2629.78 --> 2637.62]  you have someone literally take 300 out of the out of the cash register of a convenience store and they
[2637.62 --> 2644.66]  are going to the slammer oh yeah and and and so they should it's traumatic for the staff and and and
[2644.66 --> 2652.90]  like it's a it's a crime that it's a crime but then you know you you manipulate the value of a stock
[2653.86 --> 2659.30]  you don't disclose that you're buying large amounts of it so this is what happened he didn't disclose
[2659.30 --> 2666.18]  correctly that he was acquiring quietly behind the scenes a vast amount of twitter stock and then disclosed
[2666.18 --> 2672.58]  it after he was supposed to and was like boom i have it all now and what typically happens if you're
[2672.58 --> 2678.66]  not stealthy about it which you're not allowed to be is as a high profile figure acquiring a bunch of
[2678.66 --> 2683.70]  stock that gets in the headlines and it drives the price up so what he did is he saved himself a bunch
[2683.70 --> 2688.34]  of money at the expense of all the people that he bought from and then he announces it to the price
[2688.34 --> 2694.18]  spikes right yeah one of my favorite ones is just like and this is speaking as a canadian before the
[2694.18 --> 2700.18]  americans get all spicy um as far as i can tell just western countries in general uh politicians
[2700.98 --> 2705.94]  being able to track their stock portfolios i've heard uh i haven't looked into this directly but
[2705.94 --> 2712.26]  i've heard that wall street bets has started tracking uh like politicians investments and finding that
[2712.26 --> 2719.46]  it's like hey if we just follow them you get really rich because you'll see they'll make like weird moves
[2719.46 --> 2724.90]  right and then some information will be publicized and then it's like oh i guess they knew ahead of
[2724.90 --> 2730.82]  everyone else so they made like investment stuff based on it it's so brutal the fact that that's
[2730.82 --> 2738.66]  just like oh that's fine it's like what ever short of infinity careful this comment says saying you
[2738.66 --> 2742.42]  should go to jail for stealing a candy bar is the hottest take linus has ever had
[2744.18 --> 2751.06]  i didn't say that i said you would i also said it was 300 from the cash register which implies that
[2751.06 --> 2754.98]  someone was coerced into giving it to you it's not a candy which is a really big deal so it's not
[2754.98 --> 2763.06]  a candy bar i didn't say you should i said you would so real real careful i've had a lot of words
[2763.06 --> 2776.02]  put into my mouth over the last little bit here oh man anyway um yeah
[2776.02 --> 2792.26]  so i think that um the whole thing is a stupid publicity stunt personally um i i i don't uh i don't
[2793.38 --> 2800.34]  yeah i i'm i'm very i'm much more interested in this than any other story that i've heard that's
[2800.34 --> 2805.94]  highly related to this lately because i feel like i almost have personal investment in just watching
[2805.94 --> 2811.38]  twitter burn because i hate the platform that's fair and if like there's a bunch of people posting
[2811.38 --> 2818.18]  like if he buys it we should all leave i'm like please buy it then because if everyone just leaves
[2818.18 --> 2823.06]  i would be stoked yeah can we can can i can i can i have a hot take though here that's sort of it's
[2823.06 --> 2827.78]  related to what you were talking about before politicians and investments yeah how is that a thing
[2828.82 --> 2835.70]  oh yeah i don't know honestly honestly right left centrist i don't care it's all the
[2835.70 --> 2842.74]  side we should all agree that that should not be it's like how is that how is it open for debate
[2842.74 --> 2848.18]  that if you are able to affect the policies that affect the valuation of these companies
[2848.74 --> 2854.50]  that that is a clear conflict of interest genuinely inside information on how things are going to be
[2854.50 --> 2865.14]  affected even like i'm i'm just a lowly media tech media peon and and i'm sitting here going you know yes i
[2865.14 --> 2872.18]  i i own zero stake i made an exception for framework whether they succeed in their mission
[2872.18 --> 2878.50]  i don't know i explained my whole reasoning for it but that was an utterly exceptional circumstance
[2878.50 --> 2887.38]  that should not be the norm like i shouldn't be just running around buying amd shares even if i know
[2887.94 --> 2893.54]  that it's gonna crush it like man do you know how often i look at what happened to amd's shares
[2893.54 --> 2898.02]  after i made that video being like you should buy amd stock i am not a financial advisor but you should
[2898.02 --> 2902.42]  probably buy amd stock right now like or i like i think i said i wish i could buy it or something like
[2902.42 --> 2909.06]  that like i knew where they were heading because just as someone who follows the industry closely i knew
[2909.06 --> 2916.02]  that nobody else had anything for at least two years and i know that a lot of the time stock number go up
[2916.74 --> 2922.98]  because of just good news and so i knew it was going to be a an endless parade of good news for amd
[2922.98 --> 2928.74]  and i knew there was going to be at least a solid six to 18 months of bad news for intel that was going
[2928.74 --> 2933.22]  to just make them go like this and they let they i think they tripled or something like that in that
[2933.22 --> 2938.82]  time i'm sitting here going have some freaking restraint you people
[2941.78 --> 2947.78]  yeah like whether we're talking nancy pelosi or oh man who was that yeah it's both sides of the aisle
[2947.78 --> 2953.38]  it's not particularly egregious uh one on the right i can't remember well it doesn't matter this
[2953.38 --> 2959.94]  this is like brutal trading on inside political government information in order to make tons of money is
[2959.94 --> 2965.78]  a they bipartisanly seem to agree that they want to do that like when you look at like the people
[2965.78 --> 2970.98]  that have been uh successful at trading it's but it's both colors it's it's absolutely red and blue
[2970.98 --> 2975.14]  all over the place it's uh it's interesting anyways
[2979.14 --> 2984.98]  yeah i'm just mad yeah me too okay let's talk about something else let's let's do some merch messages let's
[2984.98 --> 2991.54]  let's talk about how i made some money like actually you know producing something that's of value not just
[2991.54 --> 2998.82]  manipulating people's fears and sentiment about you know their gambling stocks
[3000.26 --> 3008.90]  don't go in doge don'ts to the moon i own no dogecoin no zero me neither hit me dan
[3008.90 --> 3015.46]  oh yeah oh we have a we have a stand-in producer today yeah yeah well first one's about paint
[3016.10 --> 3020.58]  ready to talk about paint i'm ready to talk about paint some more are there really 22 incoming ones
[3020.58 --> 3026.90]  i can't keep up you can't keep up what are people what's going on today it's holy crap what the heck
[3026.90 --> 3031.38]  it's my first time doing march messages there were two messages in between when i said holy crap
[3031.38 --> 3035.46]  and there's another one now i can't read them fast enough there's another one please help
[3036.42 --> 3038.88]  there are new or there's another one there are new orders in the world
[3038.90 --> 3042.34]  coming in every two days there's another one this has been the whole time i thought this is what
[3042.34 --> 3048.74]  bell dealt with what the hell is happening uh okay you know what no you stay you stay on the
[3048.74 --> 3052.10]  incoming ones okay yeah i've got a pitch for you i've got a pitch for you before we do this
[3052.10 --> 3054.42]  yeah what about help flamethrowers
[3058.58 --> 3059.06]  got him
[3059.06 --> 3066.02]  so good all right it sounds boring to me
[3070.58 --> 3077.38]  all right uh what am i looking at here this is from anonymous hey love the work you guys are doing
[3077.38 --> 3087.38]  against russia it's not that enough hey linus the so and i recently bought a new house and we're
[3087.38 --> 3093.22]  looking to repaint neither of us love eggshell i was wondering if there are any other color slash brands
[3093.22 --> 3100.34]  that you would recommend okay common misconception eggshell is not a color because eggs actually come in
[3100.34 --> 3106.18]  many different colors depending on the kind of chicken that they get pooped out of not actually
[3106.18 --> 3116.10]  poo but poo can get on them um eggshell is a sheen it's a surface finish and the reason it's called eggshell
[3116.10 --> 3123.22]  is because it has a little bit of texture kind of like an egg and it catches the light it has a little bit of shine
[3123.22 --> 3130.42]  like an egg and the reason that eggshell is good for walls is that it is a good balance between
[3130.42 --> 3135.70]  scattering the light that hits it which reduces like hot spots like shiny spots like you would see
[3135.70 --> 3142.58]  on a semi-gloss or a high gloss um and because of the bumpliness it hides surface imperfections
[3142.58 --> 3150.82]  and because of the slight um gloss to it it it has more more it has more resin that sits on the surface so
[3150.82 --> 3156.34]  it's more likely that you're going to be able to scrub it without doing damage to either the finish
[3156.34 --> 3163.70]  because it's inherently kind of bumpy and uneven or to the wall or like the paint adhesion in total
[3163.70 --> 3170.50]  so that's why that's why eggshell is good for walls your eggshell paint can be in any tint or color that
[3170.50 --> 3177.14]  you like so don't worry about don't sweat the color go pick a color put eggshell on your walls okay
[3177.14 --> 3179.38]  that's what you want to do new idea new pitch
[3182.18 --> 3189.70]  hear me out you call it a flamethrower but it's mini and you just use it to to work with heat
[3189.70 --> 3197.46]  shrink tubing and it's it's just a lighter i i kind of need one of those actually i kind of like it
[3198.10 --> 3202.66]  you know it's actually not that far off a product that i wanted to develop for ltt store
[3202.66 --> 3209.70]  i wanted to make uh and it's it's it's on the it's on the list but i want to make a like a handheld
[3209.70 --> 3217.38]  torch for lighting candles but that also has like a secondary trigger that just like is like a blower
[3217.38 --> 3221.54]  you can put it out yeah so it's like a lighter and blower and because i just want it next to my bath so
[3221.54 --> 3227.22]  when i light my scented candles for my bath because i'm a chick like that um he makes the candles himself
[3227.22 --> 3232.02]  i it they're actually pretty nice like i'm not even like i'm not throwing shade he does a pretty
[3232.02 --> 3237.86]  good job i'm kind of get i'm kind of an i'm learning to be an enthusiast yeah yeah and by the way one is
[3237.86 --> 3243.70]  candle tips hey guys can i just please make it very clear for the people to whom it was not already
[3243.70 --> 3251.22]  that when i'm like i'm a chick like that i am parodying i it's satire i'm making fun of toxic masculinity
[3251.22 --> 3257.30]  okay thank you carry on oh that was the pitch i think i was yeah yeah i like it yeah no that's
[3257.30 --> 3263.54]  it yeah like i like it just in the shape of a flamethrower yeah for sure i'm into it yeah max asks
[3263.54 --> 3269.46]  does buying an ltd store gift card help ltts cash flow or are there additional barriers we as viewers
[3269.46 --> 3276.26]  don't see seems like an alternative to pre-ordering since funds can be used towards any product max did you
[3276.26 --> 3286.82]  just spend a thousand dollars whoa what to buy one eggshell t-shirt and four two and four 250 gift
[3286.82 --> 3298.98]  cards so i actually i actually don't know how it works one moment please holy crap i need to call nick light
[3298.98 --> 3308.42]  for a second i was like oh no merch message is glitched out uh nick you're on speaker on the wan show
[3309.14 --> 3316.90]  okay so i know that uh gift cards do not show up on my sale report in the shopify dashboard
[3317.46 --> 3322.66]  does that mean shopify holds the gift card money or do they send it to us
[3322.66 --> 3333.46]  uh i believe that they hold it until it's used okay so then if people just like buy a bunch of gift
[3333.46 --> 3343.14]  cards that does not help our cash flow no okay um use a bunch of gift cards to help our cash flow i see
[3343.14 --> 3351.38]  okay uh well i'ma let max s here know that it was a really good effort good thought um should tell him
[3351.38 --> 3357.30]  how much and yeah so uh poor max bought a thousand dollars in gift cards to try and help us out with
[3357.30 --> 3367.14]  screwdriver and backpack cash flow wow yeah um okay thanks nick okay okay all right see you later
[3368.90 --> 3370.90]  oh okay um
[3370.90 --> 3383.14]  um um uh right so max if you if you wanna send a ticket to support we'd be happy to refund that for
[3383.14 --> 3393.86]  you um to hmm okay uh that's pretty beneficial for shopify to hold on to the gift yeah that's actually
[3393.86 --> 3402.02]  kind of bs yeah wow like what happens if people never spend the gift card do they just keep keep
[3402.02 --> 3408.42]  can keep it i don't know i kind of want to figure that out now that's kind of why don't we do a couple
[3408.42 --> 3414.18]  more before we uh before we do our sponsor spots zachary asks what's the hardest choice you made when
[3414.18 --> 3421.46]  building lme lmg the lmg flow plane that you can tell us about hardest choice
[3423.30 --> 3434.34]  jeez i can think of like a lot of very big yeah choices hardest choice i mean i think probably
[3434.34 --> 3438.42]  one of the hardest choices that i ever made was buying this building that's what i that's what i
[3438.42 --> 3444.34]  expected it was going to be was the first building that was such a leap i was i as far as i could tell
[3444.34 --> 3450.34]  i was going into debt for 10 years yeah um i literally remember that conversation spoiler alert
[3450.34 --> 3460.50]  we crushed it in like one and a half thanks guys but yeah i i remember sitting down and having a
[3460.50 --> 3467.54]  conversation where you were like oh like oh i know we need this to grow but like i don't know about
[3467.54 --> 3475.62]  being under debt for for a decade yeah over a building yeah yeah it worked out yeah what about
[3475.62 --> 3483.54]  you oh wow um i'm going with taking a job at a company that probably has no future whatsoever but
[3483.54 --> 3488.74]  you feel free and let me know if it's a different one yeah i know that's i mean that's that was it i i
[3488.74 --> 3496.90]  like uh i was doing really well in school i had yeah i had recruiters on me already yeah taking this job
[3496.90 --> 3500.18]  was undercutting the amount that the recruiters wanted to pay me
[3502.18 --> 3508.10]  by like and it was like way less stable and yeah by a lot as well but it just it seemed so much more
[3508.10 --> 3512.82]  interesting and it was and i'm very happy that i did it but like i'm glad too and honestly
[3515.62 --> 3520.74]  i don't it i don't know if i can say it was that hard i think like telling my parents was harder than
[3520.74 --> 3526.26]  actually making the choice oh i remember your parents level of impress being extremely low
[3527.30 --> 3533.62]  now it's very high they're both super stoked yeah yeah luke's parents and we're good yeah
[3534.98 --> 3539.30]  but like i still i can't even say it on the show but i still remember what my dad said you probably
[3539.30 --> 3546.18]  remember what my dad said why don't you just say it on the show i'd have to bleep it uh okay i'll try
[3546.18 --> 3551.30]  and time it i'm i'm just i'm still gonna say it short i'm just gonna say the letter sure just in
[3551.30 --> 3557.78]  case um after like a little bit of silence being like okay just don't it up
[3560.10 --> 3567.86]  it's like all right your your dad's so supportive yeah he's great yeah i mean for both of them like at
[3567.86 --> 3573.62]  that point in time they were helping me quite a bit financially yep um and and like i was i was close to
[3574.18 --> 3578.50]  finishing school but i was leaving and they had helped me financially for like a while at this
[3578.50 --> 3584.34]  point so i was effectively throwing away a pretty significant amount of their investment and calling
[3584.34 --> 3590.98]  them on the phone to be like yeah i'm gonna yolo this youtube thing dude so the fact that they weren't
[3590.98 --> 3596.02]  like more negative about it was really cool and then very quickly yeah like once they i guess
[3596.02 --> 3600.18]  understood more about it because for a long time it was just like this thing i did to help fund my
[3600.18 --> 3605.22]  schooling yeah and now they're like oh wait what once it started becoming more of a thing they were
[3605.22 --> 3612.02]  very quickly on board um like my mom was full on board when we were still in the in the house right
[3612.02 --> 3617.94]  so like like they were yeah they were i mean by then by then we like were hiring more people and we
[3617.94 --> 3623.38]  like actually had recurring revenue i mean okay so no that's not fair they were both on board before
[3623.38 --> 3627.46]  then as well i don't know if you remember but my brother and my mom helped us move that's true
[3627.46 --> 3632.42]  out of your garage to the yeah i remember that it didn't take them that long yeah luke's parents are
[3632.42 --> 3638.50]  super cool his whole family is super cool yeah um i was once threatened by one of his relatives with a
[3638.50 --> 3643.54]  knife man have we told we've probably told that story we have told the story but even then super cool
[3643.54 --> 3651.22]  i'm over it there's a significant amount of land between those two people like man i still i still
[3651.22 --> 3655.06]  i don't remember the words you said because it's just kind of not the way my memory works but i still
[3655.06 --> 3662.02]  remember the tone of your voice when you it felt like you just you really needed reassurance when you
[3662.02 --> 3669.70]  told me that you had told your parents that we were doing this yeah it was like you really needed to hear me
[3669.70 --> 3676.90]  say this is gonna be okay yeah and at that time i didn't really know the answer because we hadn't
[3676.90 --> 3683.86]  locked down the ownership of the ltt channel from ncix yet yeah i remember having already committed
[3684.58 --> 3690.42]  and knowing you were down the hall because i like lived with you at this point updating your linkedin
[3690.42 --> 3695.54]  because you weren't sure if we were gonna get the channel i'm like this is bad
[3695.54 --> 3703.86]  i don't know if i've ever talked about hey i did tell you though that wherever i went i would try to
[3703.86 --> 3711.54]  take you with me i'm just like yeah i made it clear that like luke was part of the package yeah you
[3711.54 --> 3714.90]  had my back you had my back i'm not saying you didn't have my back i'm just saying in that situation
[3714.90 --> 3720.66]  that was a very i'm sure you remember that was a very doom and gloom because i mean it i don't think
[3720.66 --> 3725.94]  either of us were that convinced we were going to get the channel well we certainly weren't sure yeah
[3726.90 --> 3732.26]  there was some there was some drama around me trying to poach another ncix employee that almost
[3732.26 --> 3741.46]  submarined the whole deal yeah submarine torpedoed jeez son of a submariner um some of you will get it
[3741.46 --> 3748.18]  yeah so so i was actually creating this linkedin profile look at this picture it was the only somewhat
[3748.18 --> 3752.90]  professional looking picture of me that existed and the only reason it looked professional is
[3752.90 --> 3761.54]  because the cheesy slogan t-shirt that i'm wearing was cropped out i mean i literally put my high
[3761.54 --> 3768.34]  school on here because what am i going to say that i flunked out of ubc you know what's great you know
[3768.34 --> 3777.54]  there's that whole stereotype or that whole um that whole um i don't know trope right where uh startup
[3777.54 --> 3787.54]  founders uh like like startup people quit school but i flunked out luke quit like what a year from
[3787.54 --> 3794.82]  completion something like that okay ed was the worst because as far as i remember is he still here oh i
[3794.82 --> 3801.78]  wish he was still here in the office to tell the story it's terrible okay ed was like one half of a
[3801.78 --> 3809.94]  semester from completion he actually started working for us on like a uh like a school uh a school endorsed
[3810.58 --> 3818.98]  like a work study like program like for credits and then he literally as far as i can tell just
[3818.98 --> 3821.78]  never went back and stopped replying to emails
[3821.78 --> 3830.10]  i don't know why did you people have so much faith in me i don't know did i look like i knew what i was doing
[3832.58 --> 3837.54]  a lot of the stories from that time like trying to trying to recall them like this was the same with
[3837.54 --> 3843.22]  the mountain story like when i was talking about the lightning it doesn't feel real and then i i like
[3843.22 --> 3847.86]  pick up some evidence like after watching after i told that story about the lightning i said it was really
[3847.86 --> 3853.22]  close yeah in my head i was like 30 feet ish but then i'm like that doesn't sound real i can't say
[3853.22 --> 3857.78]  that and then i went back and i watched some of those old videos and there's austin who was with
[3857.78 --> 3862.82]  me at the time talking about how close it was at that time because it's on film yeah i'm like oh my
[3862.82 --> 3868.82]  goodness my memory was actually correct that's insane another thing i want to bring this up now before
[3868.82 --> 3874.26]  i forget it yeah if you you mentioned the old shirt that you had on for the linkedin profile yeah if you
[3874.26 --> 3881.78]  google ltt store on the sidebar it comes up with uh line of sebastian canadian youtuber like your
[3881.78 --> 3887.54]  your like wikipedia page yeah and then it's just this picture of this really old picture of you
[3887.54 --> 3892.34]  wearing your old badminton shirt like everyday badminton every day i'm shuttling yeah and then
[3892.34 --> 3898.98]  if you if you click images i don't know why i did this if you click images it's like almost all just
[3898.98 --> 3907.86]  like you wearing very little clothes like so many of the results are just partially partially nude
[3907.86 --> 3921.86]  like by the way this is amazing oh man what is that oh that's funny that's actually really funny oh no
[3921.86 --> 3928.98]  all right uh what what are we supposed to be talking about right now i don't remember uh oh
[3928.98 --> 3934.50]  i'm really enjoying the show today i'm having a great time uh the store oh the show is brought to
[3934.50 --> 3943.78]  you by uh something ovh cloud hey let's let's do this uh ransomware and other cyber attacks are the
[3943.78 --> 3948.66]  enemy of today's data-driven organizations an fbi center that collects cybercrime complaints said that
[3948.66 --> 3954.74]  it received over 845 000 reports last year with estimated potential losses totaling 7 billion
[3955.38 --> 3959.78]  strengthen your disaster recovery capabilities then with ovh cloud built on a vmware v-sphere
[3959.78 --> 3963.70]  environment to help ensure your business critical data is available at all times and in multiple
[3963.70 --> 3969.38]  locations ovh cloud owns its networks so there are no hidden fees no ingress or egress fees except for
[3969.38 --> 3975.22]  object storage or changes for or charges excuse me for api calls with no fluctuating invoices you can
[3975.22 --> 3980.42]  plan for and manage your operational expenses and their proprietary networking technology vrac which
[3980.42 --> 3985.54]  by the way is really cool enables networking of multiple ovh cloud servers from any ovh cloud data

[4177.30 --> 4183.14]  there's your spelling all right what do you want to talk about next i i found that very interesting
[4183.14 --> 4189.30]  because we use literally every single one of those i know right that was one heck of a sponsor rack um
[4190.26 --> 4196.58]  it's like why do we even bother exchanging money yeah just like yeah let's just simplify this process
[4201.14 --> 4208.34]  uh let's talk about honda because this yeah honda um you guys can yourself yeah yeah yeah i mean you
[4208.34 --> 4214.82]  know i talk a lot about anti-consumer behavior from tesla because tesla kind of is their own worst enemy
[4214.82 --> 4219.54]  when it comes to making headlines for being complete jackasses to their customers but that
[4219.54 --> 4225.46]  doesn't mean that i am any more tolerant of it when anybody else does it and this is not cool this was
[4225.46 --> 4232.02]  posted on the drive okay honda orders big takedown of honda related 3d printing models from maker
[4232.02 --> 4239.86]  communities we're not just talking things that for which there exists a honda exact part or things with
[4239.86 --> 4246.66]  honda logos on them or things with even honda the word honda as part of you know where you could make
[4246.66 --> 4251.38]  an argument that it's against their trademark you know in their font or whatever they took down
[4252.50 --> 4259.78]  everything from stuff anything that was compatible with a honda and honda can quite frankly eat a
[4259.78 --> 4268.74]  gigantic dick like that is not cool i really hope that like throughout all of these communities people are
[4268.74 --> 4274.58]  able to uh compile together all of these different files and just like throw them up somewhere and
[4274.58 --> 4284.10]  let people download them like because like that's this drives me nuts a lot of the parts were even just
[4284.10 --> 4290.50]  compatible there was no first party other solution so you're just taking all this work that people have
[4290.50 --> 4304.26]  done to make your product better yeah and you're like why to what end so rough annoying too because
[4304.26 --> 4309.70]  that's the parent company of my car and i've been holding off getting a different car i shouldn't say
[4309.70 --> 4314.74]  new car because i have no real interest in buying a new car but i've been holding off uh updating my car
[4314.74 --> 4321.46]  car because i really like my car so i would want just like a newer more electrified version right but
[4321.46 --> 4330.18]  now uh i don't really want to support this so now no this is extremely extremely anti-consumer behavior
[4330.18 --> 4337.06]  there is no excuse no excuse i don't even care someone in flow plane chat mentioned streisand effect
[4337.06 --> 4342.50]  yeah that's what i'm kind of saying is like i i hope people bring together all these files and keep
[4342.50 --> 4347.86]  pushing them in other ways uh that honda's not as easily able to take down and i hope more people
[4347.86 --> 4353.70]  use them and more people either repair their cars or add features or do whatever um i'm gonna stay angry
[4355.62 --> 4365.46]  why next topic yep what is it instion's gone so okay yeah what this is a huge problem in iot now instion
[4365.46 --> 4370.50]  was not one of the biggest brands in the space by any stretch of the imagination but they were a home
[4370.50 --> 4377.22]  automation uh brand that made hubs switches uh lights basically
[4379.78 --> 4387.46]  they are gone the system status still says online which i guess is hilarious but they have essentially
[4388.10 --> 4397.86]  shut off their servers uh everyone's hubs are offline um and yes right here from simulane on reddit
[4397.86 --> 4403.14]  this is the problem with having a single provider for the entire technology stack and this is why i was
[4403.14 --> 4411.86]  so angry about having any kind of cloud integration for anything in my home because you cannot guarantee
[4411.86 --> 4420.42]  to me that you will still be around in a year 10 years a hundred years homes do not just you don't
[4420.42 --> 4427.14]  replace them you upgrade them you upgrade them you repair them certainly but you don't just replace them
[4427.14 --> 4433.14]  it's a very different mentality when you are buying something to integrate into your home
[4433.78 --> 4441.94]  versus when you are you know buying a essentially more of a consumable like a consumer electronic device
[4441.94 --> 4449.22]  or a or a couch things that actually do tend to be replaced every so often like i don't mind if a
[4449.22 --> 4456.34]  piece of cutting edge technology like a television um you know has some kind of uh change in its
[4456.34 --> 4460.58]  cert actually no that makes me pretty angry too because we had that whole situation around nintendo
[4460.58 --> 4466.66]  closing the uh the wii u shop as well as uh which was the other one they closed tvs inserting ads
[4466.66 --> 4472.98]  and like weird stuff like that inserting ads changing the experience yeah that sucks but killing
[4472.98 --> 4478.10]  the functionality after the fact this is why an entire generation of gaming experiences is not going
[4478.10 --> 4488.42]  to exist for the people that come after yeah and it it's just it's extremely frustrating yeah yeah the
[4488.42 --> 4491.78]  ziffu over on twitch says i got an error code on one of the controllers for my heated floors
[4491.78 --> 4500.98]  past service got an error that says replace the unit past serviceable age unreal so no everything
[4500.98 --> 4506.18]  needs to be locally controlled so that the worst case scenario is that you can keep running whatever
[4506.18 --> 4516.58]  software you had bugs and all that has to be the worst case scenario so rip insteon i'm really frustrated
[4516.58 --> 4522.98]  that this is happening but you know every i'm not the only one who called it this this is what happens
[4522.98 --> 4528.34]  when every company creates proprietary crap that only works with their own proprietary crap
[4529.94 --> 4536.98]  speaking of which uh do you know how many times brandon's model x has been back to tesla no like three
[4536.98 --> 4541.78]  and they wanted like 900 for some stupid thing he wants to do like a whole video about it just like the
[4541.78 --> 4547.14]  the joys of electric ownership like three years later how how glad am i that i spent this much
[4547.14 --> 4554.34]  money on this car um because like man most most uh service centers like won't touch them really in
[4554.34 --> 4560.50]  other anti-consumer news tim cook hates sideloading tim cook delivered the keynote speech at the global
[4560.50 --> 4566.50]  privacy summit in washington dc and his he mostly highlighted apple's privacy features and their ongoing
[4566.50 --> 4570.66]  fight to protect privacy this is a quote as a company we're profoundly inspired by what technology can
[4570.66 --> 4574.90]  make possible but we know too that the technology is neither inherently good nor inherently bad it is
[4574.90 --> 4578.98]  what we make of it it is a mirror that reflects the ambitions of the people who use it the people
[4578.98 --> 4584.58]  who build it and the people who regulate it it's good script writers um or speech right i guess
[4584.58 --> 4588.58]  technically it's a speech not a script script of a speech he also highlighted apple's features that
[4588.58 --> 4592.90]  give users control over their data like the app tracking transparency he is against proposed
[4592.90 --> 4596.90]  regulations that would diminish these features and expose users to privacy and security risks
[4596.90 --> 4601.54]  here in washington and elsewhere said cook policy makers are taking steps in the name of competition
[4601.54 --> 4606.02]  that would force apple to let apps onto iphone that circumvent the app store through a process called
[4606.02 --> 4611.54]  sideloading said cook this means data hungry companies would be able to avoid our privacy rules
[4611.54 --> 4617.22]  and once again track our users against their will it would also potentially give bad actors a way around
[4617.22 --> 4623.22]  the comprehensive security protections we have put in place putting them in direct contact with our users
[4623.22 --> 4629.62]  if we are forced to let unvetted apps onto iphone the unintended consequences will be profound warned cook
[4629.62 --> 4634.50]  and when we see that we feel an obligation to speak up and ask policy makers to work with us to advance goals
[4634.50 --> 4637.62]  that i truly believe we share without undermining privacy in the process
[4639.06 --> 4647.22]  boy it definitely has nothing to do with how much money they make having a monopoly on software sold on their mobile platform
[4647.22 --> 4653.78]  yeah because there's other solutions here right oh absolutely treating it like this is the only possible solution
[4653.78 --> 4660.02]  to completely have no barriers whatsoever to malware on the iphone do you imagine for a second
[4660.66 --> 4667.54]  that apple is going to just be like okay yeah well you know what let's go i'll take you three steps further
[4667.54 --> 4674.10]  we're going full root access to everything here we go boys like considering okay two things not only does the app
[4674.10 --> 4678.18]  store take a cut which is the main thing that people only ever talk about because honestly the other
[4678.18 --> 4684.82]  one is is not that big of a deal yeah but they also take a fee to be on the platform at all sure do um
[4685.62 --> 4692.74]  i would be much more okay with it if like if we had to handle the the uh the uploading of the files
[4692.74 --> 4698.98]  to the to the users all this other type of stuff and they just ensured that it was all privacy okay
[4698.98 --> 4705.70]  right and then maybe we have to list it on the app store or whatever but um we pay this fee it gets
[4705.70 --> 4709.62]  a privacy check mark from them and then we have to handle everything certification process or something
[4709.62 --> 4713.94]  fine with that that's an easy workaround you don't want to do that though because your whole actual
[4713.94 --> 4719.46]  point is just to make sure you keep getting your cut and that it doesn't get extremely transparent dude
[4720.50 --> 4724.42]  man stop trying you've seen the whole thing where apple like claims they don't know how much they
[4724.42 --> 4728.82]  make on the app store oh yeah and jaden just brought this up too you have to use a mac to develop for
[4728.82 --> 4738.34]  them like dude it's brutal oh oh there's a there's a thing i'm supposed to there's a thing i'm supposed
[4738.34 --> 4744.26]  to uh show where's uh where is it there's another ltt store thing i forgot about i need your guys's i need
[4744.26 --> 4751.30]  your guys opinion ask the audience about the duvets linus the duvets we are working on the bedripper
[4751.30 --> 4762.74]  so it's actually inspired by um like green pcb green and cpu pin gold so if you look really
[4762.74 --> 4768.42]  closely we can't get in close enough it's shaped like the pads on the bottom of an lga cpu here do
[4768.42 --> 4774.02]  you want to just look at mine sure there you go and we've got a couple of different colorways this one
[4774.02 --> 4782.58]  is actually uh more like it's the same uh pin it's the same pin shape for this design it increases
[4782.58 --> 4790.02]  in size or decreases in size and density in order to uh get this kind of this pixely uh gradient-y
[4790.02 --> 4797.30]  kind of thing so we want to hear from you guys uh which ones do you like do you like the the more cpu
[4797.30 --> 4803.46]  colored one or would you prefer something that's a little more monochromatic and more likely to match
[4804.18 --> 4810.58]  um yes jayden other this is how you get your other decor um yeah i don't know i would say straw
[4810.58 --> 4817.06]  pull it but that didn't exactly work out that great yeah is there a better i i why is straw pull crappy
[4817.06 --> 4823.14]  now i don't know i think twitch implemented their own polling thing and i think twitch was the main
[4824.10 --> 4829.46]  reason why people use straw polls so maybe there's like something else now oh okay i don't know i'm
[4829.46 --> 4833.70]  you know what i'm gonna give them one more try i'm gonna give them one more chance and then if this
[4833.70 --> 4839.38]  sucks and doesn't work then we will we will just have to move on people are telling me to make my
[4839.38 --> 4846.10]  own straw poll we've been thinking about making a polling thing um but there's honestly just so much
[4847.14 --> 4852.90]  there we go sorry about that guys so i'm dumping that into the chat youtube chat is moving
[4852.90 --> 4857.14]  pretty fast but guys go ahead and take a crack at trying to click on one of these
[4858.90 --> 4866.02]  in the meantime uh why don't we jump into our oh oh in the meantime we should definitely do some more
[4866.02 --> 4873.38]  merch messages uh there are not too many curated ones which is good and it looks like dan are you
[4873.38 --> 4877.86]  in are you in slightly better under control shape over there yeah i think it calmed down which is always
[4877.86 --> 4883.54]  nice okay do you want to want to read us a few yeah sure had a conversation with a bud a few times
[4883.54 --> 4889.54]  how do you feel about using chinese smartphones from brands that send user data to china or have in
[4889.54 --> 4899.54]  the past uh blue the only uh one plus hawaii uh that sort of huawei huawei yeah do you care at all is it
[4899.54 --> 4910.66]  better than google um okay so i as a non-chinese citizen and as someone who doesn't really have to go to
[4910.66 --> 4918.10]  china um to me sending my information to the chinese government is frankly not really that
[4918.10 --> 4922.50]  different than sending my information to the american government i think the chinese government
[4922.50 --> 4929.22]  has made it very clear that they can and will use citizens data against them uh there's some very
[4929.22 --> 4938.02]  alarming footage coming out of china right now um they're they're if their authoritarianism was not
[4938.02 --> 4945.70]  apparent before for some reason i think it's pretty clear now uh how they intend to use the information
[4945.70 --> 4953.06]  that they harvest from their citizens um but as a non-citizen i i don't really see what difference it
[4953.06 --> 4959.14]  makes if they know what apps i'm using on my phone or whatever the case may be so for me personally no
[4959.14 --> 4966.82]  i don't care i don't especially want to benefit the ccc uh the ccp in any way but someone said cccp
[4966.82 --> 4971.86]  you know the codec pack anyway uh i don't want to benefit them in any way but i
[4974.58 --> 4979.54]  i have other reasons for not using those brands of chinese phones just generally speaking i find that
[4979.54 --> 4985.06]  their android skins like kind of suck and they tend to be a china first experience preloaded with apps
[4985.06 --> 4989.38]  that i don't care about some of which aren't necessarily removable so that's where i'm at on
[4989.38 --> 4996.74]  that we have another update from max here who spent more money uh to tell you that there's no ticket
[4996.74 --> 5002.74]  needed because uh it's no difference buying now or later uh the first order was to funnel money to you
[5002.74 --> 5005.54]  thank you for answering his question thanks max
[5005.54 --> 5016.10]  okay hit me again um this one's from andrew any plans for more streams with other lmg team members
[5016.10 --> 5021.78]  uh sarah's was pretty entertaining as for my friend mythos turkey bacon is better than regular bacon turkey
[5021.78 --> 5028.58]  bacon is amazing have you tried turkey bacon no oh it's so good plans for more streams sarah's yeah sarah's
[5028.58 --> 5034.58]  was great it's it's something that i think we absolutely should and could do more of but it's
[5034.58 --> 5040.10]  not something that's on our radar right now just because man are there ever a lot of balls in the
[5040.10 --> 5045.70]  air at the moment with the labs coming by the way uh we're pushing that another week i'm so sorry next
[5045.70 --> 5052.58]  week i promise for real okay so also we've been working with this uh startup company to do the call
[5052.58 --> 5058.34]  for this uh and they they like walked me through how it should work and everything it's very it's an
[5058.34 --> 5064.90]  extremely streaming friendly calling service uh and it i think it's going to be great we'll have to
[5064.90 --> 5069.86]  try it for us to see uh but every single week they're like hey are we doing it this week we're all ready
[5070.66 --> 5075.94]  we're all ready to go we're excited to like to see it go live and then i'm just like uh no
[5077.14 --> 5086.90]  sorry guys next week we're working on it oh man okay it'll happen it'll happen uh do you want more
[5086.90 --> 5092.26]  yeah keep keep hitting me sure uh this one's from nick i live out in the woods in the southern us
[5092.26 --> 5097.06]  and my internet is less than three megabits per second on a good day there's no major isps in the
[5097.06 --> 5105.54]  area any way possibly to get decent internet speeds uh no hot spots either probably not no no i mean starlink
[5106.42 --> 5112.10]  like that's a good yeah that's that's about as good as it's going to get unfortunately also you mentioned
[5112.10 --> 5120.34]  woods and you mentioned bacon uh if you go camping in bc and you go past a indigenous ran gas station
[5120.34 --> 5128.18]  it's pretty common that they'll have bacon there it's like incredible every single time yeah wow
[5128.18 --> 5132.82]  i'm gonna have to try it's actually amazingly good just a just a recommendation if you come by bc and
[5132.82 --> 5138.42]  you're going camping it's like you get a bag on the way there you get a bag on the way back it's great
[5138.42 --> 5143.86]  it's worth it both ways oh this one's uh this one's kind of exciting this for matt hey linus
[5143.86 --> 5149.46]  luke and bell i'll have to let him know i work for asml uh we supply sorry i keep getting messages
[5149.46 --> 5155.06]  here yes i know who asml is hi you have my attention we supply lithography machines uh have
[5155.06 --> 5160.02]  you heard of samsung or intel i've been chatting with bell about this already but i was curious to be
[5160.02 --> 5167.46]  interested in touring our factories i mean does a bear shit in the woods well there's bacon there
[5167.46 --> 5173.78]  apparently so um yeah i meant jerky i don't know why i said yes i and my audience would be quite
[5173.78 --> 5181.86]  interested in fact in seeing asml's facilities drag him there personally yeah uh there there's
[5181.86 --> 5187.22]  absolutely no way that i would that i would give up the opportunity to go check that out
[5187.22 --> 5191.14]  um all right

[5210.58 --> 5215.22]  deal with the incoming very much and i'll switch to going through the curated ones and you're asked are you
[5215.22 --> 5218.98]  still happy with your security camera setup will you be having a similar setup in the new home yes
[5218.98 --> 5224.74]  i will have a similar setup it will all be not on the cloud thank you ubiquity for not having
[5224.74 --> 5232.66]  subscription fees or uh cloud access unless i authorize it um for any of my security stuff
[5233.30 --> 5239.06]  uh by the way we are hope we were hoping to have ubiquity come on and talk about that lawsuit against
[5239.06 --> 5245.22]  the blogger um it looks like for legal reasons that might be a bit of a challenge that makes sense
[5245.22 --> 5250.82]  so all we're gonna have to do is like i said i love the products i love the mission uh i i am
[5250.82 --> 5255.62]  hoping for the best when that is all resolved i'm i'm hoping they come away clean i just don't like
[5255.62 --> 5261.30]  the optics right now yeah uh by the way before you do more of these there's a couple more topics that
[5261.30 --> 5266.10]  i feel like we should probably touch on are you getting through these because you have to go i do have to go okay
[5266.10 --> 5272.50]  got it ian says i found out you ride as well how's the new backpack fit on the motorcycle good for for
[5272.50 --> 5279.22]  my body type and for my bike i have a street bike bram says hey linus with three kids and running lmg
[5279.22 --> 5284.02]  floatplane creator warehouse how do you keep yourself mentally sane with the life you're living and giving
[5284.02 --> 5287.62]  it everything you have do you think your lifestyle is sustainable thanks for all the videos in it
[5288.18 --> 5292.26]  there might have been more to this but it got cut off um i have a lot of help guys like that's the
[5292.26 --> 5296.74]  thing it's like luke runs floatplane i don't know i don't want to float plane nick runs creator warehouse
[5296.74 --> 5302.18]  i don't want to create a warehouse yeah right like what about lmg like we've got we've got yvonne
[5302.18 --> 5308.66]  and colton we've got james we've got uh just we've got ed we've got all these people who are
[5308.66 --> 5314.58]  running these departments um if anything i actually think the team has really stepped up in a big way in
[5314.58 --> 5320.26]  the last six months to make my life way more manageable i mean there's always going to be crazy days
[5320.26 --> 5326.74]  we did a collab with call me chris yesterday where i was there's 400 minutes of footage
[5327.46 --> 5334.34]  and i was in front of the camera for probably 11 hours it's a challenging day for sure like it's not
[5334.34 --> 5342.66]  like i'm you know not still not still going for it but guys i have a ton of support and you know i have
[5342.66 --> 5349.62]  to give myself um and yvonne credit for building a team to support us for having the foresight to do that
[5350.10 --> 5356.58]  but that doesn't take anything away from the actual efforts of the people actually doing it uh this is
[5356.58 --> 5364.18]  not it's not just me and yeah i i think i think that what i'm doing is sustainable for some time i'm
[5364.18 --> 5370.10]  excited i'm actually really pumped right now uh screwdriver backpack some of the other products that we have
[5370.10 --> 5377.70]  coming labs um we you know i think i read a comment on floatplane that really it hit me so hard that i
[5377.70 --> 5385.78]  i blasted it out to the entire company uh calling what we've been doing lately the golden age of ltt
[5386.34 --> 5394.18]  and considering how many times i've seen our community claim that we are in the golden age i honestly i'm
[5394.18 --> 5401.62]  energized i'm starting to feel like the golden age never ends golden decade like why why stop here
[5401.62 --> 5405.70]  yeah why don't we just make it more golden yeah bring on the xbox controllers
[5405.70 --> 5413.54]  that might not have been golden age yeah yeah i'm ready boys
[5415.78 --> 5420.02]  uh anonymous says what part of the tech space really needs more competition to create better products
[5420.02 --> 5428.58]  and more innovation man cpu gpu looking pretty good right now what else we got i feel like i've had
[5428.58 --> 5435.54]  this thought printers i like it yeah sure okay i feel like i've had this thought recently but i can't
[5435.54 --> 5440.26]  remember what man there's so much competition even like streaming gear now like
[5442.10 --> 5447.38]  i mean i'd say that i'd say that the linux community is underserved still in a in a big way but i'm
[5447.38 --> 5450.10]  expecting that to change with steam deck taking off the way that it is
[5452.58 --> 5455.54]  man where do we what really needs to improve
[5457.54 --> 5465.54]  oh i swear i had the thought of like so and so is using this thing because it is the only option i
[5465.54 --> 5469.62]  feel like i had that thought in the last like week but i can't remember what it was vr headsets is one
[5469.62 --> 5474.98]  from your headsets definitely just to be completely honest yeah e-ink display stuff says laddie okay yeah
[5474.98 --> 5480.74]  yeah i think i think the vr headsets thing though i think we're still not completely not crap tablets
[5480.74 --> 5485.22]  yeah it's hard for there to be any more competition amazon is so dominant in the cheap tablet space
[5487.30 --> 5490.98]  yeah monitors there's a lot of great monitors out there you know i feel like monitors are doing
[5490.98 --> 5497.70]  pretty good yeah there's a lot of innovation in monitors right now man cutie oled uh zachary
[5498.26 --> 5503.62]  hey linus any update on the emulator video i'm wondering if you got into soft mods like playing ps2 games over

[5567.62 --> 5576.42]  thank you nick what about the printout photocopy the poll hey we are we are still live uh but just
[5576.42 --> 5582.02]  barely what's up oh um somebody tweeted at me so i thought we should correct the record apparently
[5582.02 --> 5587.22]  we do get the payout for the gift card at the time that it's sold it's just not listed in literally
[5587.22 --> 5592.50]  anything except the actual payout report which you or i never really look at so apparently we do get
[5592.50 --> 5598.74]  that money so yeah rock on that seems a lot more correct okay hey thanks it makes way more sense yeah
[5598.74 --> 5604.50]  yeah you know you just have to look that deep into it so correcting the record thanks nick all right
