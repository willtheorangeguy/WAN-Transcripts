[0.00 → 11.14] interesting what is up everyone welcome to the wan show we've got a great show lined up for you
[11.14 → 18.18] today uh thank you Luke that's really helpful lots of fantastic topics starting of course
[18.18 → 28.12] with YouTube hiking the price of YouTube premium literally a day after i go to bat
[28.12 → 33.68] talking about how well the service is really expensive to run and there are a lot of challenges
[33.68 → 40.40] and data storage so we'll be talking a little bit about that uh also we're going to be talking about
[40.40 → 48.32] AMD being kind of uh boned right now the situation is not looking good they've apparently cut
[48.32 → 56.06] production of their dozen 7000 chips uh what else we got lined up today Luke LTT in other languages
[56.06 → 62.22] we actually have videos that we can show you on the actual channel we can show you how it works
[62.22 → 68.04] and we can show you the dubs i have not listened to them, i will be first time reacting to this
[68.04 → 75.80] we'll see how it goes also they are on espanol i honestly wasn't entirely sure that i
[75.80 → 80.20] could nail the pronunciation of that and i hadn't heard you say it yet so i didn't want to do it
[80.20 → 85.96] um but I'm pretty sure i didn't nail it Luke is that the only one are we doing more languages beyond
[85.96 → 94.36] that oh we're starting with Spanish starting with Spanish very cool um also g4 TV is done
[94.36 → 102.14] again it's done it again not again maybe not forever who knows but certainly for now but
[102.14 → 106.38] the most recent one is done Comcast pulled the plug we'll talk about that later
[106.38 → 115.26] intro do i run the intro i guess so i certainly can't uh intro auto boom got him yeah it worked
[115.26 → 121.44] and Linus you're uh you're clipping a little bit on your side could you move on away or speak
[121.44 → 122.98] quieter i don't think you can do that
[122.98 → 129.98] i don't think i can do either of those things okay we'll just deal with it
[129.98 → 140.98] nice Messi MSI and 45 drives thank you very much uh i think this is going to be an interesting show
[140.98 → 146.44] because i realized during the intro that Linus does not have a swear button oh yeah I'm gonna
[146.44 → 151.50] have to control myself today it's also going to be an interesting show because Luke disclosed to me
[151.50 → 157.20] before we started that he's on painkillers I'm on painkillers let's go i don't know if you guys
[157.20 → 162.02] can notice, but this side of my face is a little swollen we'll maybe talk about that later even
[162.02 → 166.86] though it's like kind of gross and not that interesting let's go oh yeah yeah it's an injury
[166.86 → 172.92] you know it's an injury to the one side of Luke's mouth you know what I'm saying just to the one side
[172.92 → 180.52] had some blunt force trauma and Linus isn't here i wonder what's going on um
[180.52 → 187.08] she's cheating oh wow that actually hurt okay oh sorry i have to not react to things too
[187.08 → 194.46] let's jump right into YouTube hiking the price of premium plans in several countries that's right
[194.46 → 202.08] literally the day after i uploaded the video that i teased on when show last week when i was defending
[202.08 → 210.22] YouTube charging for 4k video so putting it behind a premium paywall YouTube turned around and increased
[210.22 → 217.34] the price of my premium family plan from 18 Canadian dollars to 23 Canadian dollars
[217.34 → 224.68] 23 Canadian dollars it's a big job that is a substantial increase what does that what does
[224.68 → 233.34] that work out to like a 30 hike or something like that i thought it was like 25, and we are not the only
[233.34 → 242.08] ones to have our prices increased the U.S. and the UK went from 17.99 of their currency to 22.99 and
[242.08 → 249.84] 19.99 respectively and other regions are getting similar hikes uh in Argentina where inflation has
[249.84 → 258.76] reached 95 the jump is particularly aggressive individual plans went from 78 U.S. cents to two dollars
[258.76 → 272.98] and 53 U.S. so that's like wow over tripling um and then family plans went from a dollar 17 to 455
[272.98 → 280.94] again tripling that is brutal that's crazy additionally now this is something that i feel like we can
[280.94 → 286.70] really dig our teeth into YouTube is hiking the price of family plans for users who subscribe
[286.70 → 295.98] through Apple's app store from 22.99 uh to 29.99 taking that route has always been more expensive but
[295.98 → 301.58] YouTube is now explicitly disclosing this in their announcement email so for the people who are not
[301.58 → 308.74] familiar with why YouTube premium would cost more Luke what's the deal with that the app store takes a
[308.74 → 316.32] monstrous cut this is true on android and uh and iOS platforms I'm not trying to just
[316.32 → 325.94] go after them but the yeah these app stores take huge cuts uh i think generally in the 30 percent
[325.94 → 332.42] range which is a lot just for hosting some downloads in a store um now my understanding
[332.42 → 340.24] is that you weren't allowed to charge essentially a 30 percent surcharge amount more yeah to account for
[340.24 → 344.84] it yeah but like i thought that was actually against they've been shifting the rules on that
[344.84 → 349.72] um i don't know exactly where it stands right now because the last time that they shifted their rules
[349.72 → 355.76] uh we matched exactly what their rule change was, and then our app got denied for following their rules
[355.76 → 360.46] and then i had to have like an hour-long phone conversation about that and then our app got approved
[360.46 → 368.98] because nothing matters apparently um so i don't know but yeah the the the line keeps moving
[368.98 → 375.20] because lawsuits and whatnot keep on happening um that makes sense yeah that makes sense I'm not sure
[375.20 → 380.34] but i guess you can now unless we're going to see a huge legal battle between them but i I'm
[380.34 → 385.66] pretty sure you can, I think you're allowed to charge a differing amount at this point i think that this
[385.66 → 391.42] raises some pretty interesting questions let's get through the price increases so original subscribers to
[391.42 → 398.00] YouTube red family plans who were grandfathered in at 14.99 a month are going to be subject to the new
[398.00 → 406.08] 22.99 price but not until April 2023 with everyone else getting the new price on their next billing cycle
[406.08 → 416.24] and i think that the conversation needs to be why is this allowed this is not a free or or or ad supported
[416.24 → 422.86] service uh whereas people so helpfully pointed out when we were talking about the whole does ad block
[422.86 → 431.34] equal piracy discussion um it does not actually have any kind of explicit uh you know contractual
[431.34 → 436.82] agreement between the platform and the user i think that there's certainly a terms of service and you
[436.82 → 442.94] know there are conversations to be had around what the implied agreement is for the use of the platform
[442.94 → 451.32] but this is a is a paid agreement how is it exactly that lawmakers have no sort of identified
[451.32 → 460.26] this as something that absolutely needs to be stopped this single party um renegotiation of
[460.26 → 464.60] the deal like do you feel a little bit like land oat this point Lando Christian
[464.60 → 471.96] i like that i enjoy the reference um i don't know it's weird because like
[471.96 → 477.72] with inflation we've seen really intense inflation lately um
[477.72 → 484.20] the mentioned here but in Argentina where inflation has reached 95 it hasn't been that bad
[484.20 → 489.74] in like Canada or the states, but it's still been really, really bad if you have inflationary periods
[489.74 → 494.48] if you if you sign an agreement with some companies okay I'm going to pay um what was the original
[494.48 → 500.62] YouTube red one 14.99 i believe yeah oh I'm going to pay 14.99 yeah well in 10 years that 14.99
[500.62 → 505.20] doesn't have the same power that it had when you originally signed that agreement so maybe it could
[505.20 → 512.68] be a situation where like uh rate increases have to be within a reasonable margin or something i don't
[512.68 → 520.20] know um i mean yeah it's also not until next billing cycle, so people could cancel we saw that in the
[520.20 → 526.38] early days of the pandemic where they mandated that rent could not be increased um certainly not
[526.38 → 531.74] over a certain amount i know there are places where rent increases need to be within uh a certain
[531.74 → 539.38] percentage or they are considered to be illegal, but you know i guess from my point of view it's just
[539.38 → 546.02] it's its not what i agree to i don't see why that should be i don't see why that should be permitted
[546.02 → 552.66] for a service i mean you're right obviously if you don't like it you can just not pay for it but
[552.66 → 559.20] they're not even they're not even they're not even putting up a facade do you think the timing
[559.20 → 565.42] feels suspicious trying to do the right thing um the timing feels very suspicious to me not based
[565.42 → 571.54] on not based on your video to be clear no what I'm talking about is the changes coming to chrome
[571.54 → 580.70] oh when i first read this i was like oh yeah so they're going to like completely screw over ad blockers
[580.70 → 588.16] and right before they do that they're going to do a massive rate hike to YouTube premium this might
[588.16 → 593.62] this might just be me like finding things where they don't exist but the timing's not you know
[593.62 → 601.18] exactly lined up, but it's pretty close if i remember correctly um the i don't remember the exact
[601.18 → 607.82] verbiage for the change but what they're doing um to chrome that is going to impact ad blockers and
[607.82 → 614.32] probably some other things but very notably ad blockers um is going to happen i believe in January
[614.32 → 622.08] which at this point is a few months away it's not that far off yeah that's pretty soon yeah there's
[622.08 → 628.44] some perfect questions about this coming in from float plane chat so first of all cast 54 points out
[628.44 → 637.60] that they should at least at the very least not be able to charge people the new rate until they click a
[637.60 → 643.32] button that says they're okay with it, and they could absolutely cancel your service but to me like
[643.32 → 649.76] i remember when we migrated float plane from the LTT forum to its own site to floatplane.com
[649.76 → 656.78] and i remember it being extremely complicated to change the terms of a recurring service agreement
[656.78 → 664.44] um man this word keeps escaping me um when you know unilaterally there we go that's the word I'm
[664.44 → 670.74] looking for to just unilaterally change the terms of the agreement, and we ended up having to have
[670.74 → 678.30] people manually go through and um sign up again for the new site we lost a lot of interesting that
[678.30 → 683.46] interestingly enough I'll throw some context in there um that is completely correct that was very
[683.46 → 688.18] difficult one of the main reasons why that was difficult is because we were actually changing business
[688.18 → 694.42] entities so when it was through the forum it was under Linus media group when it was through the
[694.42 → 698.72] float plane website it was under float plane so we were changing business entities there's a bunch of
[698.72 → 704.64] issues there because we were transferring uh payment agreements from one company to another um and i think
[704.64 → 710.12] that might be possible, but it was way beyond us at the time if it is even possible at all i don't know
[710.12 → 715.72] um so we had to have people manually move themselves over the other interesting tidbit is we can
[715.72 → 722.80] absolutely change people's agreements and increase or decrease prices at will the reason why it's
[722.80 → 729.36] never come up is we're obviously not going to do that because that's incredibly stupid uh speak for
[729.36 → 733.64] yourself you'll just get you'll get wrecked as a company if you do that at least that's been our
[733.64 → 738.44] opinion on it so obviously we don't do that uh, but there is ways that you can set up where you
[738.44 → 743.18] can totally change people's uh the monthly value i love the idea of needing to press a button
[743.18 → 750.88] though because something that we know this at float plane and anybody who has ever done twitch
[750.88 → 757.80] streaming at a professional level knows this as well when you have paid subscriptions you will have
[757.80 → 761.76] and this I'm saying we know this at float plane I'm not saying it's a good thing it's just something
[761.76 → 767.06] that we have knowledge of because if we didn't, we would just be stupid yeah um but if you have paid
[767.06 → 773.28] subscriptions at all there are going to be people that forget about them maybe the five
[773.28 → 778.18] bucks or the three bucks or the ten bucks isn't a ton to them maybe they aren't really uh
[778.18 → 784.12] really on top of their credit card statements whatever else it's even worse um when you sign up
[784.12 → 789.04] for things on yearly plans because when people go to review their credit card statements they don't
[789.04 → 796.16] see it coming in one in 12 chance to catch it yes, yes um so it's totally a thing so if you don't
[796.16 → 801.54] if you don't have and a lot of people will also see a charge coming in, and they're like oh that's
[801.54 → 809.58] uh Amazon or or YouTube or google or Walmart or whatever like i recognize what this is
[809.58 → 814.56] and this is a payment that i pay every month okay that's fine so not necessarily paying too much
[814.56 → 817.96] attention to what the value is, but they're like oh yeah i subscribe to YouTube premium that's the
[817.96 → 822.22] YouTube premium payment sounds good yeah um especially people that have currency conversions
[822.22 → 828.50] so that makes sense changing the price sure they send an email when's the last time you read a
[828.50 → 835.38] marketing email from YouTube i mean i did read this email because it was like your price is going up
[835.38 → 844.22] i tweeted about it because i just i felt so uh i don't know i appreciated the irony of the
[844.22 → 850.36] timing you know how i learned about this because i felt i filter it out i never even this email
[850.36 → 854.28] never hit my inbox on my personal email because it's a marketing email i just filter it out i don't
[854.28 → 860.56] care i learned about this because your tweet oh really oh that's hilarious because i didn't see
[860.56 → 867.94] the email and I'm a YouTube premium person, so this sucks like I'm not stoked get ready to pay another
[867.94 → 873.54] five dollars or six dollars or whatever it is yeah um black spectre over in float plane chat asks
[873.54 → 881.66] I'm still keeping my three dollar plan right um yeah i mean i am also on the 4k plan, but it's always
[881.66 → 887.32] good knowing i can fall back to the three dollar plan if i need to wait you have two active subscriptions
[887.32 → 894.80] to float plane so that you can have the 4k tier, and you can also maintain your grandfathered OG tier
[894.80 → 902.18] status in case you need it so you're actually paying 13 a month to retain the ability to
[902.18 → 907.20] pay three dollars a month if you need it in the future they would need two accounts i think you
[907.20 → 913.78] need a financial advisor because that is not great planning actually but hey thank you for the 13
[913.78 → 918.76] dollars a month someone in chat said i never got an email and my payment is ten dollars am I special
[918.76 → 924.46] um i don't know how your payment is ten dollars I'm not sure what currency you're paying in
[924.46 → 929.26] uh but you i haven't heard of a different region premium ever being ten dollars yeah so you must be
[929.26 → 936.44] in a different region maybe your region isn't uh isn't affected by this i don't know i don't know
[936.44 → 941.80] this is hilarious i wonder how many of our float plane subscribers are duplicates now i want the team to go
[941.80 → 946.72] look into that like how many of these accounts are coming from the same IP all the time and stuff
[946.72 → 954.34] oh um or like have identical names and use the same credit cards or whatever yeah that would have
[954.34 → 959.32] that would be a fair amount of digging um yeah you guys should just not pay us twice
[959.32 → 965.38] so uh yeah i mean you can if you want I'm not gonna I'm not going to like refuse to take it but
[965.38 → 970.54] yeah um you should just buy more stuff on Ltd store that's uh that's smarter because then you get like
[970.54 → 976.80] shirts and stuff um Nicholas m asks what i want to know is if this five dollar increase is going to
[976.80 → 983.20] benefit the creators that i watch and that is one silver lining that is one part of the argument that
[983.20 → 992.32] i made in the 4k should be paid video that at the very least what YouTube is doing um through their
[992.32 → 999.84] really like unprecedented the way that YouTube shares revenue is unlike any other platform the
[999.84 → 1006.64] degree of transparency and the percentage that they share are way more generous than anyone else and
[1006.64 → 1014.48] so there's a reason that creators are constantly trying to figure out how to grow on YouTube whatever
[1014.48 → 1022.48] platform people come from the really successful online creators ultimately end up on YouTube and the
[1022.48 → 1029.52] reason for that is because of the way that they share revenue and yes the answer is yes uh this would be
[1029.52 → 1036.46] um this would be subject to the same revenue sharing agreement that regular premium is that ad
[1036.46 → 1044.66] senses, and it's one of the ways that google attracts talent to the platform so so so effectively in a way
[1044.66 → 1050.04] that just nobody else has figured out how to match and i shouldn't say has figured out how to match i think
[1050.04 → 1055.78] everyone else has figured out how to match it you have to choose like actually pay money to creators
[1055.78 → 1062.50] but companies like bite dance don't want to do it so they just don't and i think that's one of the
[1062.50 → 1068.70] reasons that YouTube has stood the test of time while other platforms like vine and like i ultimately
[1068.70 → 1076.18] believe TikTok um come and go and come and go and come and go while YouTube remains, and you've got a lot
[1076.18 → 1083.54] of people talking about like especially in the comments on that video you know angrily and justifiably
[1083.54 → 1090.18] angry right like i get it but angrily talking about how this is the last straw YouTube taking away 4k is
[1090.18 → 1097.02] this is going to be the last straw and I'm going for an alternative, and it's like guys there is no
[1097.02 → 1103.86] alternative because at the end of the day content is king that is always going to be true
[1103.86 → 1113.56] and so yeah it's tough right there's some people in chat saying oh sorry go for it no, no go for it
[1113.56 → 1118.58] there's some people in chat saying that they have uh YouTube premium at 7.99 apparently that's a student
[1118.58 → 1122.40] plan thing there's other people in chat saying that they have YouTube premium at 10 bucks which is
[1122.40 → 1130.12] apparently if you had Google play music and like maybe something else you got grandfathered multiple
[1130.12 → 1134.58] times something something something i don't know what's going to happen to all of those uh but in
[1134.58 → 1141.54] general there is an it's a big rate do you know uh so it is what the creators take from
[1141.54 → 1151.34] premium views a percentage of the premium price correct it is okay, so the whole premium dollars go into a big
[1151.34 → 1158.42] fat bucket and then uh i think i tweeted out the percentage share incorrectly actually i believe it's 55
[1158.42 → 1165.96] to the creators 45 to the platform and that 45 is not all profit for the platform that includes payment
[1165.96 → 1172.60] processing fees which as Luke knows yeah he's nodding can be quite substantial and that which I'm sure
[1172.60 → 1177.34] helps they do run their own which is cheaper, but they're still going to be paying to you know AMEX or
[1177.34 → 1181.92] visa or whatever other credit card processors that they support or whatever else and there's cost of
[1181.92 → 1188.10] making and maintaining your own payment professor yes and the cost of actually uh hosting the
[1188.10 → 1197.40] data and uh delivering it so it's a pretty it's a pretty good deal for creators which is why the creator
[1197.40 → 1206.94] ecosystem has just blossomed into this vibrant community that they have now, and they have so much
[1206.94 → 1212.66] first movers' momentum on this i just don't see realistically how anyone is going to catch them
[1212.66 → 1218.26] yeah I've always kind of seen YouTube that way we had i don't think i don't know if it was last week
[1218.26 → 1224.58] uh, but we were talking about uh like what resolutions would you still watch YouTube at
[1224.58 → 1230.72] and it was like basically whatever because where else am I going to go for this um yeah, and it's like
[1230.72 → 1237.78] it's it gets to the point where it's like um if the resolution goes so low you just don't watch videos
[1237.78 → 1244.80] because where else are you going to go twitch God is does not cover what YouTube does at all daily
[1244.80 → 1249.48] motion does not cover what YouTube does at all like no one else is in that game like Vimeo get real
[1249.48 → 1256.18] Vimeo if anything has made themselves has made it even more clear in the last like year that they are
[1256.18 → 1264.02] not interested in chasing that ad supported free content uh mega site it's really hard audience
[1264.02 → 1271.34] they yeah it's its super hard um lumber wand over in YouTube chat i know there's a first time for
[1271.34 → 1277.68] everything uh says so if i have premium and ad block does that money still get properly attributed
[1277.68 → 1283.74] to the creators that i watch uh well my question is why do you have ad block if you have premium
[1283.74 → 1292.04] yeah um but also yes your premium watch time as long as you're signed in gets divvied up according to
[1292.04 → 1297.22] watch time or sorry your premium money gets divvied up to the creators you watch according
[1297.22 → 1303.10] to watch time ratios yes that's right yeah people have asked a bunch of times like what why don't you
[1303.10 → 1309.08] make free ad supported tiers on flow plan I'm like because it's an insane amount of work like it's its a
[1309.08 → 1315.56] massive amount of work to broker those advertising deals, or you're just jumping on something like
[1315.56 → 1322.78] YouTube AdSense anyway yeah yeah you're giving google a cut then you can't be competitive with
[1322.78 → 1330.30] them regardless so like what is what does the value add here like it's its it's tough it's an it's a
[1330.30 → 1335.82] hard space to be in okay this kind of leads into one of our discussion questions which is why does
[1335.82 → 1341.76] YouTube seem so unconcerned about the potential for moves like this to push users towards ad blockers
[1341.76 → 1346.60] so they're not concerned i don't think about users just leaving the site altogether i think
[1346.60 → 1355.08] maybe they've gotten a little complacent but also rightfully so but as for ad blockers i mean Luke
[1355.08 → 1363.08] you have the have the technical capacity to block ads on YouTube, but you subscribe to YouTube
[1363.08 → 1369.12] premium, and you seem to have telegraphed earlier in the show that you intend to pay the new 2299
[1369.12 → 1376.78] price for premium as opposed to uh setting up an i mean i don't even know how to completely block
[1376.78 → 1383.66] YouTube ads like i know on mobile it's a little challenging on TV it's very challenging um
[1383.66 → 1389.46] well on mobile you can just use mobile like brave or whatever with an ad blocker but on
[1389.46 → 1395.88] on TV i believe it's quite challenging and you won't get your 4k anyway if that was your goal on mobile
[1395.88 → 1405.60] if you use an alternate browser well uh there are other ways on mobile um, and you can
[1405.60 → 1409.80] still get your 4k uh but i have premium so i don't care and i don't want to talk about it uh
[1409.80 → 1416.92] but there yeah on TV i have no idea because I've never been interested in watching YouTube on TV
[1416.92 → 1422.96] to be completely honest um so i haven't looked into it myself on mobile it's definitely possible
[1422.96 → 1432.12] um on computer it's definitely possible i did mention earlier uh in and i believe it's January
[1432.12 → 1439.76] um someone manifest v3 is coming that's gonna mess with ad blockers maybe we'll see if that'll that'll
[1439.76 → 1445.36] push that down in regard to add blocking i do think this will cause a little bit of that
[1445.36 → 1454.90] i do question how many people would go from paying for it to add blocking it because of this change
[1454.90 → 1460.42] I'm sure it will be some but will it offset the increased amount that they'll make from charging
[1460.42 → 1467.88] way more like this is a massive increase you know what i actually i want to play devil's advocate
[1467.88 → 1475.52] here counterpoint i actually think the odds of someone who was paying before turning to add block
[1475.52 → 1480.42] assuming they for whatever reason couldn't keep paying their premium subscription if this was one
[1480.42 → 1488.08] cappuccino too far right you know okay um so they unsubscribe it's a lot i actually i disagree
[1488.08 → 1494.82] i think that they would be more likely than a typical user because they are a probably an enthusiast
[1494.82 → 1501.26] user of the platform one that was willing to pay so one that probably consumes a lot and b have
[1501.26 → 1508.74] probably grown very accustomed to not seeing ads on YouTube so i would actually imagine these
[1508.74 → 1515.30] people digging pretty hard for an alternative i mean I'm going to I'm going to reiterate my my my
[1515.30 → 1520.66] privateering stance and that's that using the platform in a way that does not compensate creators
[1520.66 → 1527.52] for their work is detrimental to the platform that you appear to be enjoying and may claim to like
[1527.52 → 1534.70] the content on um and so you know make of that what you will and make your decision accordingly
[1534.70 → 1540.92] but that doesn't change that people are going to be i think surprised especially if they've been on
[1540.92 → 1549.72] premium for a while by how many flipping ads are on YouTube now yeah yeah i mean i wouldn't even know
[1549.72 → 1556.28] anytime i open in the wrong browser i run away immediately because i i hate seeing the
[1556.28 → 1562.86] ads for me, it's its an it's a big multi-tiered thing where i i i want to support other creators
[1562.86 → 1569.60] on YouTube because i watch a bunch of YouTube um and i know they get better cuts when I'm watching as a
[1569.60 → 1575.36] premium subscriber so i think that's cool i like that part of it i like that there are no ads and i
[1575.36 → 1582.22] don't feel bad about it um i understand that there is actually a huge amount of cost um so just blocking
[1582.22 → 1588.88] all the ads on YouTube um feels a little wonky when i feel quite strongly about the whole malvertising
[1588.88 → 1595.00] thing i don't think i need to go over that for like the 20th time on wan show um but i don't
[1595.00 → 1602.08] necessarily think that malvertising on YouTube is actually a big problem um maybe it is but I've
[1602.08 → 1607.74] never heard of it being a problem i mostly am interested in stopping those types of problems
[1607.74 → 1615.34] outside on other parts of the internet um but yeah supporting a platform that i use a ton
[1615.34 → 1620.30] that i know costs a lot to run and being able to support other creators that i actually want to support
[1620.30 → 1624.24] through doing that knowing that they make more money off of it all of those things together
[1624.24 → 1630.16] makes it pretty reasonable instead of just presenting problems then why don't we why don't
[1630.16 → 1635.70] we talk solutions i mean i would never advise someone to circumvent the terms of service of a website
[1635.70 → 1645.42] um I'm sorry excuse me sorry i thought excuse me uh you know i would never say something
[1645.42 → 1651.28] like that but if it really is a step too far i mean one of the things that struck me about this
[1651.28 → 1657.14] price increase is that even though it's like a 30 increase or 25 increase or whatever it's still
[1657.14 → 1666.80] three dollars and 33 cents U.S. per member of my family a family plan is 23 a month or whatever
[1666.80 → 1673.24] Canadian and i have five people using it and I'm kind of sitting here going you know what it's its kind of
[1673.24 → 1680.54] funny how common it is right for people to share a Netflix account, and yet i almost never see anyone
[1680.54 → 1686.22] talking about sharing a YouTube premium account and i understand it's less convenient to share a
[1686.22 → 1690.52] YouTube premium account just because there's so many other google services that you might use
[1690.52 → 1698.78] that you might want you might actually want um to contribute to informing your recommendations
[1698.78 → 1705.50] and things like that like it's such a personalized service but i mean we used to talk choices
[1705.50 → 1710.54] yeah if the choice is to not that's true we used to talk about it because you shamelessly were
[1710.54 → 1714.40] piggybacking off of my family plan yeah actually yeah now that i think about it, you're not sharing
[1714.40 → 1721.94] how can you do this to me, I'm sorry first child Luke um actually now that i think about it no i was
[1721.94 → 1726.46] being done before you don't actually have to share the login anyway no you get up to five
[1726.46 → 1731.56] accounts on the single family plan so i wouldn't, I wouldn't talk about you know circumventing terms
[1731.56 → 1736.78] of service that would never be a thing that i would talk about i just i think that it's worth you know
[1736.78 → 1744.44] considering if maybe there could be ways that are not as detrimental to creators for people to help to
[1744.44 → 1754.10] offset some of the um increasing cost yeah for sure there's i think there are debs and just like you can
[1754.10 → 1760.56] talk about uh exploits and bugs and systems um without encouraging people to do them there are
[1760.56 → 1769.92] definitely ways uh to uh yeah reduce the impact of this change for sure um like using Firefox
[1769.92 → 1778.48] in January for no specific reason um or or or yeah potentially um expanding your family
[1778.48 → 1786.30] yeah i mean really aren't we all family yeah in the tech community yeah why not i feel like we're
[1786.30 → 1794.12] just all family and so you know with that family yeah with that family spirit in mind uh it really
[1794.12 → 1800.08] does just seem like kind of a kind of an obvious middle ground like i pay literally you know for myself
[1800.08 → 1806.56] i pay 350 right a month for YouTube premium that seems sustainable forever they could double
[1806.56 → 1812.80] the price and i would still find that to be quite reasonable and i just want to say you know no
[1812.80 → 1821.28] matter who you are you probably have four friends and if you don't I'm so sorry to hear that uh but
[1821.28 → 1827.88] you know it's it could be a goal for you, you might not have four friends that all want to pay
[1827.88 → 1839.12] for YouTube um, but you might find them i wouldn't be surprised if there was like a discord server
[1839.12 → 1845.50] or something that sprung up which was like oh man to find the amount of feels bad man and forever alone
[1845.50 → 1849.08] i mean that's in twitch chat though i mean we knew they didn't have friends because they're hanging out
[1849.08 → 1852.20] with like people who don't know they exist in hot tubs so
[1852.20 → 1866.34] oh man all these par asocial relationships i know right if you have four non-par asocial friends
[1866.34 → 1871.22] you can't attack them for par asocial relationships wait why not
[1871.22 → 1874.98] because we're not going to have any viewers yet
[1874.98 → 1879.48] oh whatever they'll keep watching
[1879.48 → 1886.02] yeah that's the thing about par asocial relationships is you can make fun of them for it, and they'll still
[1886.02 → 1894.36] do it anyway yep it's all what's up Barrington whoa no JK love you Barrington he's one of our most
[1894.36 → 1904.96] OG oh g oh g followers yeah um all of float plane chat feels extremely called out
[1904.96 → 1917.04] oh no amazing all right is it six people you and five others no i think it's no five total i believe
[1917.04 → 1923.66] i don't know yeah I'm not sure yeah because otherwise i have no excuse for not having Luke on our
[1923.66 → 1933.50] any more yeah oh man bullying everyone this has gone extremely well this last little bit why don't
[1933.50 → 1942.02] we move on to our next topic here uh should we do AMD yeah let's do AMD because uh they they they
[1942.02 → 1948.44] they about to get done yeah after launching with a fairly strong showing with dozen 7000 AMD looked like
[1948.44 → 1956.00] they might be doing pretty okay, but intel was looming with 13th gen raptor like CPUs and they
[1956.00 → 1962.12] may have cut the celebration short apparently it's been a little rough launched yesterday the new CPUs
[1962.12 → 1971.14] posted impressive numbers with the core 9 13 900k these names are getting really long uh apparently it is
[1971.14 → 1976.76] manager plus five by the way so yeah six people even cheaper than i thought okay sorry carry on
[1976.76 → 1986.94] bring me back again um but yeah apparently they're topping the charts over AMD's more expensive 16 core
[1986.94 → 1994.48] dozen 9 7950x in all but the most heavily multithreaded workloads which does make sense can we talk about
[1994.48 → 2003.68] that for a moment i feel like much there much ado gets made of multithreaded performance but for the
[2003.68 → 2009.44] average consumer what most people are doing um outside of like maybe four threads four to eight
[2009.44 → 2014.52] threads is anything you do actually heavy heavily multithreaded like to be clear it's pretty rare we're
[2014.52 → 2020.36] not going to stop talking about multithreaded performance in reviews because it has been and
[2020.36 → 2025.90] continues to be a very forward-looking way of measuring the performance of a CPU because
[2025.90 → 2032.82] theoretically in the future workloads will come but for the average consumer who doesn't spend all day
[2032.82 → 2041.60] you know doing that CPU video encoding for peak quality or um you know rendering out complex scenes in
[2041.60 → 2046.88] blender i mean show of hands like Luke want to throw up a poll in the float plane chat how many of you
[2046.88 → 2056.00] actually use blender like other than to link around with it once a quarter you know how important is
[2056.00 → 2062.46] multithreaded performance oh this is a great comment in twitch chat was bound to happen eventually
[2062.46 → 2068.34] Kelton says scores are cine bench enhancers yeah oh
[2068.34 → 2077.86] let's get this poll going to do you actually use blender on a regular basis 20 we've got 80 82 83
[2077.86 → 2086.22] saying no uh we've got a couple percent saying yes, and then we've also got like 15 percent liars in
[2086.22 → 2091.94] there i also yeah yeah i was going to say like i really wonder how many of the yeses are people just
[2091.94 → 2103.28] being like AMD is good okay come on i regret my thread ripper every single day oh yeah yeah how's
[2103.28 → 2109.54] that upgrade path going for you Dan i yearn for death i spent so much money on that computer so
[2109.54 → 2117.90] much money um, and it's its uh yeah multi-thread is sad this is one of the reasons why uh future
[2117.90 → 2123.96] proofing is something that we always kind of scoff at a little bit I'll be f word yeah because when
[2123.96 → 2130.04] when people talk about like oh i want to like really multi-thread capable CPU because
[2130.04 → 2139.62] the future um if it's not really happening it's kind of hard to dev software like that um
[2139.62 → 2148.98] so people just don't do it uh VT roseless in twitch chat says every last furry is destined to
[2148.98 → 2157.32] learn blender for VR there's literally dozens of us yes that's that that is true though i guess that
[2157.32 → 2163.80] makes sense i wanted to build myself an uh i wanted to build myself a model for uh beat safer streaming
[2163.80 → 2171.06] and i realized that even though there are kinds of pre-done no not a furry one necessarily but
[2171.06 → 2177.10] even though there are pre-done like uh starting points and there are guides you have to really
[2177.10 → 2183.48] get into the weeds with modelling software to uh to like to draw it and rig it up and I'm like
[2183.48 → 2188.96] oh this is far beyond my skills it would be i would be far better off just paying someone to do this
[2188.96 → 2195.14] then i looked into how much it costs and i was like uh ready player now or whatever it's called
[2195.14 → 2200.96] that uh that service that just like you pick some generic attributes and assets, and it just starts
[2200.96 → 2207.96] out a model for you uh that'll do for me, it's its totally free man i so back when i was in high
[2207.96 → 2212.98] school I've talked about uh my high school computers teacher a few times and i mentioned a few shows back
[2212.98 → 2218.80] that he created this like 3d game programming course for us, we had to do some basic
[2218.80 → 2226.88] 3d modelling in that class, and we used this program called milk shape so it sounds like milkshake but
[2226.88 → 2231.80] it's milk shape yeah and i just googled it to see if it was still a thing and i don't think so
[2231.80 → 2238.62] but yeah i used to do some of that stuff a long time ago it's kind of cool
[2238.62 → 2246.72] anyway um yeah we should continue that also people are asking if merch messages are not a thing today i
[2246.72 → 2252.18] don't actually have the dashboard open are they a thing yeah they are um I've only gotten eight
[2252.18 → 2257.92] oh maybe it's because we didn't talk about them guys so if you want to send a message into the show
[2257.92 → 2263.06] the way to do it is through merch messages not twitch bits not super chats nothing like that you
[2263.06 → 2268.18] want to send a merch message all you got to do is head over to lttstore.com and in the checkout
[2268.18 → 2274.12] you're going to see a field where you can enter your merch message, and it'll either be replied to by Dan
[2274.12 → 2278.66] it'll show up at the bottom of the screen if you just want to do like a shout-out or something like
[2278.66 → 2285.28] that uh or Luke and i might address your comment or your question live towards the end of the show
[2285.28 → 2292.88] uh the lttstore.com deal of the week is the jerry rig knife is back in stock and if you pick up a 1200
[2292.88 → 2302.06] by 700 desk pad and add a knife to your cart the knife is free also oh this is sick Luke bring them up
[2302.06 → 2308.58] we have shoelaces now there they are they come with this adorable little power supply shaped box
[2308.58 → 2314.34] that has the shoelaces coming out like cables and the reason that these are notable is if you have
[2314.34 → 2322.70] or want to get the RGB hoodie these are actually the same laces so you can get that drip going on or
[2322.70 → 2328.86] however it is that you use that word yeah by having your shoelaces match your hoodie drawstring which
[2328.86 → 2335.16] um i thought was pretty cool oh you guys can see this, but there's like there's a fan on this side
[2335.16 → 2340.38] of the power supply and there's even like the grill the power switch and the plug on the back it's kind
[2340.38 → 2345.22] of cool this is pretty I'm not going to claim there's anything special about the shoelaces other
[2345.22 → 2351.16] than that they match the hoodie drawstring they've got some like white stitching pattern on them
[2351.16 → 2358.64] yep i don't know yeah they feel nice and sturdy i wonder if we can do a close-up with a producer cam
[2358.64 → 2365.72] let's see so the 1200 by 700 desk pad then add a knife and the knife is free it's a sick deal that
[2365.72 → 2372.10] is a 15 us dollar value, and you can use it to send in a merch message you have the box we also
[2372.10 → 2376.56] we also just generally have the knives in stock so if you don't need a desk pad you can always just
[2376.56 → 2381.30] like pick up a jerry rig everything knife i think there's probably a conversation to be had around
[2381.30 → 2388.84] should we just carry more influencer merch like is there any reason not to just have other people's
[2388.84 → 2394.40] merch on our store i don't think so why not maybe we should yeah i don't see why not
[2394.40 → 2401.34] yeah all right let's continue the AMD discussion especially if there's something that isn't just like
[2401.34 → 2407.76] a shirt yeah you know sort of have a bunch of shirts uh yeah continued AMD discussion
[2407.76 → 2417.82] so all of this all of this AMD crushing power does come at a currently trendy cost which is kind of
[2417.82 → 2424.96] surprising to me that this is currently trendy, but the power consumption is monstrous apparently our
[2424.96 → 2431.32] testing saw a peak of 350 watts, but other outlets measured power draw up to 400 watts
[2431.32 → 2439.10] and beyond with the limiters removed and with throttling on 360 millimeters AI o coolers
[2439.10 → 2448.76] wow so you basically need chilled water dang yeah we're bringing it back we're bringing the chiller
[2448.76 → 2456.10] going sub ambient voice yeah sub ambient and uh Anthony has a note saying this means it's
[2456.10 → 2464.20] possible to approach a kilowatt of sustained draw for a personal home computer i added that little
[2464.20 → 2475.32] bit in between CPU and GPU alone with a 4090 test rig wow that's crazy especially when like so many
[2475.32 → 2481.90] other things are trending in the other direction and going down in power draw we have the uh the top end
[2481.90 → 2487.58] performance on and on personal computers just cranking power draw as far as i can tell pretty much as hard
[2487.58 → 2497.36] as they can, you know what we've actually got a video coming where we run uh a RTX 4090 and a dozen 9
[2497.36 → 2509.72] 70 900 x on a 550 watt power supply, and we play cyberpunk sustained on a 550 watt power supply so and
[2509.72 → 2516.12] this is giving up like less than five percent performance one of the cool things about uh the
[2516.12 → 2521.46] new dozen 7000 series we haven't tested it with 13th gen, yet it's possible others have I just i haven't
[2521.46 → 2530.92] looked yet but um with dozen 7000 and with the RTX 4090 is that they actually undervolt extremely well
[2530.92 → 2537.04] and you can achieve very surprising wasn't undervoting i thought it was lowering the power target
[2537.04 → 2544.24] uh well it's a combination so you lower your power target until you find a point where it starts to
[2544.24 → 2552.18] behave kind of weird and then you set your uh you set your turbo target to kind of whatever
[2552.18 → 2556.48] megahertz you're running at that point then you adjust your voltage current anyway we show it in the
[2556.48 → 2563.72] video it's an it's a process though uh, but basically we managed to get it running stably on a 550
[2563.72 → 2568.76] watt power supply without actually giving up a ton of performance to be clear that wasn't with me
[2568.76 → 2575.68] running two power viruses at once that was with me running an actual game uh but in real world usage
[2575.68 → 2581.98] i think it would probably be stable which isn't to say you should ever do that no, no no I'm just saying
[2581.98 → 2589.34] that you can lower the power consumptions of these new of these new um components it just
[2589.34 → 2594.30] might take a little bit of work, but the thing is that we've reached the point where the work might
[2594.30 → 2600.48] be worth it man like it used to be that we would put all this work into tuning for more performance
[2600.48 → 2605.94] right with overclocking but now with energy prices going the way they are particularly in Europe right
[2605.94 → 2611.80] it could actually save you hundreds of dollars over the lifespan of this computer to undervolt it
[2611.80 → 2616.14] yeah yeah someone said uh let me see if i can find it again
[2616.14 → 2625.78] with someone in I'm a flanker in flow plane chat says uh with current UK pricing for electric that's
[2625.78 → 2632.78] 34p an hour for gaming wow that's going to add up
[2632.78 → 2641.78] yeah it's going to add up a lot actually that's uh i mean man that's a question that's like that's like
[2641.78 → 2648.74] what it cost at the arcade you know when we were young right like if you had to put a coin
[2648.74 → 2654.86] right if you had to put a quarter in the machine every hour would you game as much as you do or is
[2654.86 → 2658.56] it just the fact that you're not really thinking about it because it's coming in on a monthly billing
[2658.56 → 2666.22] cycle if i had to put a quarter in every hour i probably wouldn't I i think i would genuinely play
[2666.22 → 2673.42] those games right like that's that's a pretty high friction transaction actually yeah and to be
[2673.42 → 2680.80] clear i still believe that gaming remains one of the best bang for the buck entertainment
[2680.80 → 2687.46] mediums right like you can there's especially with free-to-play games that you really do not
[2687.46 → 2694.50] have to put money into you know games like League of Legends for example um like there 's's
[2694.50 → 2699.54] nothing that comes even close you know you look at it compared to like a movie going to the movies or
[2699.54 → 2704.86] going paint balling or whatever else it is like gaming is an unbelievable bang for the buck
[2704.86 → 2711.80] assuming you actually do it enough to offset the upfront cost but man that starts to eat into it
[2711.80 → 2717.60] a little bit 25 cents every hour my goodness, and it's a lot more than that that's closer to 50 cents
[2717.60 → 2723.98] so if you had to put you had to pop a quarter into your desk every half hour i do not see you doing
[2723.98 → 2732.24] that sir yeah no that's yeah sometimes sure but not i would probably reduce yeah
[2732.24 → 2740.24] um to that's wild i want to figure out exactly how much it is
[2740.24 → 2750.66] what is so that's sense right p pence is it yeah, yeah so 0.334
[2750.66 → 2758.08] yeah yeah you're right 52 cents that's a lot yeah that's actually like a ton
[2758.08 → 2766.42] yeah my solar panels are starting to look like a pretty smart investment yeah yeah i remember when
[2766.42 → 2771.58] solar panels up here were not um obviously they've gotten a lot more they've got a lot more
[2771.58 → 2777.70] efficient since then um they're still stupid here sir because our power is still cheap i didn't want
[2777.70 → 2781.98] to rub it in for everybody falling water, but you know the whole falling water might not keep happening
[2781.98 → 2790.10] thing is coming yeah so we did an um we did a little work field trip to Banff a number of years ago
[2790.10 → 2795.50] uh Luke didn't come he didn't technically work for Linus media group at that time long story anyway
[2795.50 → 2801.92] the point is we went to see this glacier, and they had all these markings on the ground for where the
[2801.92 → 2808.34] glacier used to be where it is now and where it is like used to be and where it's going to be
[2808.34 → 2816.80] and so just tracking this receding giant glacier and um they were like yeah so you know 30 to 50 years
[2816.80 → 2824.16] this thing will be gone and guess what that means for hydroelectric power and i was like uh like i could
[2824.16 → 2832.16] live to see the end of cheap energy in western Canada which is sort of mind-blowing what are we going to
[2832.16 → 2838.44] do i don't think anyone's talked about it yeah yeah yeah and because like everyone that i know
[2838.44 → 2844.54] just kind of shrugs it at power that lives here to be clear uh because we've always been like
[2844.54 → 2853.82] it's falling water it's fine um and i mean it is for now a lot of people asking why I'm in
[2853.82 → 2861.32] two dimensions uh budget cuts sorry yeah i have to afford my new more expensive YouTube premium somehow
[2861.32 → 2867.72] yeah it's true yeah yeah we are we got to spread the burden out you know um
[2867.72 → 2878.88] but yeah yeah yeah so these new amd chips um the biggest advantage the new chips have
[2878.88 → 2885.74] over AMD is one that AMD wants to be held, and it's the platform unlike dozen 7000 13th gen core can run on
[2885.74 → 2891.18] last gen motherboards with a simple bios update, and they can run with ddr4 memory which continues
[2891.18 → 2899.04] to be much less expensive than ddr5 in fact fast ddr4 didn't harm performance much if at all versus
[2899.04 → 2905.76] fast ddr5 um speaking of our testing we've got another sort of conversation topic here, and it's
[2905.76 → 2912.76] what the heck is going on with all the errors in the videos lately, and you know I've talked to the
[2912.76 → 2917.48] team about this and from my point of view um you know i didn't really want to say much about it
[2917.48 → 2923.52] because my goal would not be to throw any particular person or team under the bus because
[2923.52 → 2930.34] it's a little more complicated than that all i really wanted to say publicly was we owe you guys
[2930.34 → 2937.72] nothing but the best we are striving to deliver nothing but the most accurate coverage um but the
[2937.72 → 2945.08] reality of it is that we are going through a bit of a learning period right now um one of the comments
[2945.08 → 2951.92] that has come up quite a bit is why is it that publications with teams literally a tenth or a
[2951.92 → 2959.10] twentieth the size of our company are able to have their videos go up more accurately and the answer
[2959.10 → 2964.96] is that actually adding more cooks to the kitchen does not necessarily make it a smoother process
[2964.96 → 2972.58] and we're learning a lot every single time it's a different breakdown if that helps you guys at all
[2972.58 → 2979.10] to understand what's happening on our side and every single time we are patching those holes so we
[2979.10 → 2984.92] won't break down there again, and it's just going to take us a little while to get the hang of this
[2984.92 → 2993.04] between the writing team and labs and the editing team there are a lot of moving parts, and we are we
[2993.04 → 3002.36] absolutely going to do our best to um get to the point where you guys don't feel like you need
[3002.36 → 3009.22] to read reviews from multiple outlets, but we will still absolutely recommend that you always
[3009.22 → 3014.20] yeah you always look at coverage from multiple outlets that's something I've always said it's
[3014.20 → 3020.88] something that i will always say yeah okay i didn't know that was a problem the video
[3020.88 → 3030.70] um we should probably talk sponsors yeah good call the show is brought to you by Messi footwear
[3030.70 → 3037.68] Messi footwear is known for being water-resistant and lightweight easy to pack and breathable you don't

[3166.22 → 3171.36] here to help to learn more about their custom storage solutions check out the link in the video description
[3171.36 → 3182.22] why don't we go ahead and chat about another big topic here and that is oh where's the one that i
[3182.22 → 3191.78] wanted to yes Ltd on Español yeah yeah let me see if i can find this here so Luke uh should we
[3191.78 → 3196.30] play it for them now or should we play it for them a little bit later i feel like we should maybe a
[3196.30 → 3201.44] little later play it for them and then talk about it because it's cool, and it's not like it's
[3201.44 → 3207.72] happening now it has happened it's live you know and let's do it if people don't want to watch it
[3207.72 → 3211.32] through the stream I'm going to play it through the stream so if you want to watch it through the stream
[3211.32 → 3215.50] you can just do that, but you can also bring it up on your own end like it's its live and
[3215.50 → 3221.16] it functions now something that i didn't know until i sat down, and we went over this is that uh you don't
[3221.16 → 3227.58] have to make a new channel for it anymore, so this is just on the actual main channel uh this is a
[3227.58 → 3232.64] really cool feature so we can see what you're doing uh it's so cool that's not what i meant to press
[3232.64 → 3238.26] there we go I've had a lot of people commenting too whether it's on the is that you don't have to
[3238.26 → 3245.04] make a new channel for it anymore so this is just on the actual main channel uh this is a really cool
[3245.04 → 3251.06] feature technical difficulties great we'll get there anyway let's turn off that screen sharing right
[3251.06 → 3258.30] away i think it's causing echo whether it's on the is that all right well i can i can walk you
[3258.30 → 3263.82] through the visual experience without a natural visible indicator so you guys all know what
[3263.82 → 3267.82] I'm talking about if you're on YouTube in the bottom right-hand corner of a video there's the
[3267.82 → 3273.00] settings cog wheel we all know it we all love it you click on it there's the audio track section now
[3273.00 → 3277.40] so instead of just like playback speed annotations quality the things you're used to having
[3277.40 → 3288.18] got it we should um it's worth mentioning a lot of people during the 4k premium controversy
[3288.18 → 3294.08] commented criticizing you know YouTube for not innovating like what is there to even do
[3294.08 → 3300.44] um and you know again i don't want to bootlick a trillion-dollar corporation or whatever but like
[3300.44 → 3307.30] scaling the way YouTube scales is really, really hard yeah and building new features at scale
[3307.30 → 3311.96] is really hard, and they absolutely do build new features and this one is one of the coolest ones
[3311.96 → 3318.62] I've seen in a very, very long time okay Luke is showing it to us now so down in the cog you can have
[3318.62 → 3327.14] multiple audio tracks on a video now, and it appears to be something that you can actually do um that you can
[3327.14 → 3334.96] actually add in post like after the fact to existing uploads so what we've done with this particular
[3334.96 → 3345.44] video is using google aloud uh we have uh created a transcript a Spanish translation transcript of the
[3345.44 → 3355.48] videos, and then we have used um i forget exactly what tool we're using to turn that into like an AI voice
[3355.48 → 3363.06] and then we've done our own uh conversion from our own voices to an AI voice to kind of fill in the
[3363.06 → 3368.50] gaps in the translation, so the idea is not to do a perfect job of localization actually here let's
[3368.50 → 3371.90] let's play it first yeah play it first, and then we'll talk a little bit more about it, i haven't heard
[3371.90 → 3373.54] this so lets's go

[3440.16 → 3448.72] I'm seeing a lot of people um I'm seeing a lot of people going either way on this you know gross
[3448.72 → 3457.60] doesn't sound human or wow it's surprisingly good almost nothing in between which is fascinating
[3457.60 → 3465.28] to me um and i want to clarify that the point of allowed this is google's translation quote unquote
[3465.28 → 3473.36] startup is to increase accessibility it's not about perfection uh but 80 of the world does not speak
[3473.36 → 3482.80] English while the majority of video content online is in English, so bilingual users might be likely to
[3482.80 → 3489.84] notice issues with pacing tone and minor translation errors because they can compare against the native
[3489.84 → 3497.76] English version but what google has found is that non English speakers are more often just impressed
[3497.76 → 3504.96] that they can access the content at all uh so if we think about it from an accessibility standpoint as
[3504.96 → 3516.56] opposed to a perfection standpoint um fern 182 in float plane chat says native Spanish speaker sounds like a
[3516.56 → 3521.68] dub show on TV a few mistakes here and there but overall way better than last time that's good that
[3521.68 → 3527.84] was our that was our goal yeah uh yeah pretty much across the board people are saying not the most accurate
[3527.84 → 3534.88] but it's okay and yes i know you know if we hired uh like a translation company and a bunch of voice actors
[3534.88 → 3540.80] you know Mr beast style that might work but okay you got to think about the scale of what Mr beast is
[3540.80 → 3547.84] doing if he's getting 30 to 50 million views on an English video, and he can assume maybe 25 as much on
[3547.84 → 3556.32] an alternate language channel um you know if we only got 25 as many views on one to two million views all of
[3556.32 → 3563.12] a sudden that would pretty much eat up whatever money we could have made on that video like it's not
[3563.12 → 3569.84] it doesn't make good business sense but if it's something that we can do relatively easily right like if it's
[3569.84 → 3578.88] something that we can do using AI and then just doing spot corrections ooh that's that's the way
[3578.88 → 3583.52] for us to tackle it because we upload so much i mean he uploads one video every like two weeks these
[3583.52 → 3589.12] days right we're uploading daily so just the scale of the cost is enormous i mean we've run into
[3589.12 → 3594.64] issues with our um with our Chinese translation where it's not even a matter of not being willing to pay
[3594.64 → 3599.76] for it, we just upload so freaking much that it's hard to find enough people who want to
[3599.76 → 3608.16] work on it yeah yeah i mean i being a not able to understand it at all
[3609.28 → 3615.68] because i can't speak a single word of Spanish i think the tech is really cool um our implementation
[3615.68 → 3620.56] completely regardless having it so that you can switch audio tracks like that and having it support
[3620.56 → 3627.76] uh languages for the use case of that feature is sweet and i think we should all be
[3627.76 → 3633.04] pretty happy that that exists on YouTube because of like what Linus is saying the accessibility stuff
[3633.60 → 3639.28] um maybe it could be better maybe it could be worse um i just think it's a really cool feature
[3639.28 → 3647.12] and I'm I'm stoked i like it when sites like YouTube innovate because there's so much that can be done
[3647.12 → 3653.76] when you have an audience that is like as close to the entire planet as you could basically get
[3655.12 → 3661.12] um so yeah i think it's really cool and i like that we're using it because why not and from like
[3661.12 → 3665.52] you know not everything is going to get translated, but this could be a great tool for people looking to
[3665.52 → 3672.00] learn English as well-being able to listen to it in Spanish and then listen to it in English i know that's
[3672.00 → 3677.92] that's how all the way around too if people want to learn Spanish well i wouldn't learn Spanish from
[3677.92 → 3684.88] an AI that's fair it's the only reason i didn't bring that up yeah never mind yeah yeah no yeah
[3684.88 → 3691.12] you're going to walk around sounding like a bad translation which is actually oh man that actually
[3691.12 → 3695.44] would make for like a good comedy short or something like that so someone who learned from
[3695.44 → 3701.76] bad translations how to speak a language yeah and just like i actually i could even see it being a show
[3702.00 → 3707.28] like back in the 80s or 90s like a Mr bean style like you have a character whose entire sort of
[3707.84 → 3714.24] shtick is that they learned you know the language from poor translations so they just
[3714.24 → 3719.84] are constantly using idioms that make no sense and i yeah that could be that could be interesting
[3720.48 → 3726.64] um digital we already uh have a translation service in China, and we have almost a million subscribers on
[3726.64 → 3731.60] billy, but thank you for the suggestion yeah yeah already a thing yeah
[3731.84 → 3737.60] i wonder if i get another gold play button i got such a kick out of getting a Chinese knock off of a
[3737.60 → 3743.44] silver you got the silver one right yeah yeah yeah I'm getting i saw the silver one years ago
[3744.56 → 3748.88] yeah i don't know if there's a gold play button on billy but I'd be super, super down
[3750.16 → 3754.64] is Spanish the only other option at the moment or is Spanish just the one you went with for the test
[3754.64 → 3763.84] uh Spanish is the one that probably has the greatest overlap of people who want to watch LTT
[3763.84 → 3771.04] and who don't speak English so like we could have gone for German for example but from my time in
[3771.04 → 3775.52] Germany i would say that that was probably going to be a big fat waste of time because practically
[3775.52 → 3778.96] everyone i met there spoke better English than half the people i went to high school with
[3778.96 → 3785.68] like their English schooling is outstanding it's always interesting when you talk to someone and
[3785.68 → 3789.52] they're like oh my English is terrible, and it's like oh it's fine it's fine it's fine and then they
[3789.52 → 3792.64] that you actually start having conversations with them, and you start kind of wondering like
[3793.36 → 3795.20] is their English might be better than mine
[3796.72 → 3805.52] exactly, exactly uh apparently Monty Python did a bit with a dodgy translation book like way back in the
[3805.52 → 3812.88] day so yep there you go yeah it's been done it's been done uh people are talking about Indian uh
[3812.88 → 3819.04] yeah one of the benefits of Spanish for us is we happen to have someone on staff who speaks native
[3819.04 → 3824.80] uh Spanish so that helps a lot uh one of the challenges with Spanish though is that there are a
[3824.80 → 3832.48] lot of regionalisms that make Spanish localization really tricky oh wait she doesn't speak Spanish oh
[3832.48 → 3839.36] whoa, whoa hold on ed's ed's messaging me in real time here Hindi is apparently coming soon do we have
[3839.36 → 3848.08] someone on staff who speaks Hindi who can like check that well i don't know all right there you go I'm
[3848.08 → 3854.40] I'm finding out I'm finding out new things that's all real time here uh anyway uh so it's really tricky
[3854.40 → 3860.00] because for Spanish different countries and even regions have their own vocabulary accents and idioms
[3860.00 → 3865.76] that can make it really, really challenging to translate but i think it's going to be one of
[3865.76 → 3871.20] those things where you just have to kind of settle on something, and it's at least better than nothing
[3871.20 → 3884.96] yeah yeah for sure um should we talk about g4 oh i mean i guess so as long as we don't say anything
[3884.96 → 3891.68] mean because it's its rude to speak ill of the dead oh i have to say this before we start so rest in
[3891.68 → 3899.68] peace zombie g4 TV uh those of you who were super stoked on the return of g4 um maybe what I'd
[3899.68 → 3907.04] like to hear is why because as someone who wasn't really didn't really have any access to traditional
[3907.04 → 3913.12] media at the time that g4 was taking off like we didn't have a cable TV subscription at that time like
[3913.12 → 3920.88] i didn't watch any TV at that time so i don't have any nostalgia for g4, but it seems like there's
[3920.88 → 3929.36] a contingent of people that were like super miss g4 and and and loved it and I'd love to hear from you
[3929.36 → 3937.04] guys like why yeah people are saying like tech TV was the bomb i know Chris peril lo had his
[3937.04 → 3942.08] break on like g4 tech TV i think tech TV was like a sub brand of g4 something like that
[3942.08 → 3952.72] yeah lots of people never even heard of it ogg4 was better i didn't hear about it until years later
[3952.72 → 3960.88] because i ended up watching um Adam seller on a game review channel that i don't remember the name of
[3960.88 → 3969.12] any more um that i believe like all the hosts left, and then it was not cool anymore um but i used to like
[3969.12 → 3975.36] that game review channel bought out tech TV but i had never that's the only reason why i knew that
[3975.36 → 3980.96] g4 existed was people would comment about him being on it back in the day on that show people talking
[3980.96 → 3987.36] about screensavers attack of the show so basically they just had a lot of like perfect hosts back
[3987.36 → 3994.08] in the day it sounds like a bunch of people call it like a lot of people calling out play
[3994.08 → 4002.16] i don't even know what i don't know what that is yeah nice right didn't have cable so we're very
[4002.16 → 4008.72] ignorant in all this so yeah when it came back i didn't have the nostalgia so i didn't uh i didn't
[4008.72 → 4013.84] go to start watching it because i never watched it in the first place i got nothing against it
[4013.84 → 4015.60] um it sucks that it went down
[4015.60 → 4023.52] uh I've heard a lot of different various commentary on this about how they think that um
[4024.56 → 4033.36] the that space is now pretty well covered by a lot of smaller independent like one to two bit
[4033.36 → 4037.52] outfits here and agile yeah um like i know um
[4039.36 → 4044.56] one that i check out all the time is game ranks that's a relatively small team that have just been
[4044.56 → 4050.80] killing it for years so trying to pull together the game explain is another tiny one that i
[4050.80 → 4057.44] know absolutely yeah um trying to bring together this massive group bunch of big names a bunch of
[4057.44 → 4063.76] fantastic hosts i have heard actually very, very good things about a lot of the people that worked on g4 TV
[4064.32 → 4069.28] and i know that there are already people trying to poach them uh both the people that worked behind
[4069.28 → 4075.76] the scenes and on camera so i suspect that the people that worked there are going to do well
[4075.76 → 4081.20] uh because apparently purple kid and twitch uh says they had good hosts even today, and it still got shut
[4081.20 → 4086.88] down Comcast sucks but i mean I'd like to talk a little bit more about that later lets let's talk
[4086.88 → 4092.96] more about that later but yeah let's carry on yeah so like i i i have heard that the the the behind
[4092.96 → 4100.24] the scenes team was just absolutely fantastic um I've heard that the hosts were all really
[4100.24 → 4106.96] good um but they just weren't really getting the viewership that they needed to sustain the cost
[4106.96 → 4113.12] of having this apparently again i don't know but i have heard this apparently massive studio and very
[4113.12 → 4122.80] extensive staff um because it's its expensive it's going to be expensive so yeah yeah it's hard it is hard
[4122.96 → 4133.04] to make quality content on an online budget and traditional media like g4's last run ended in uh
[4133.04 → 4142.40] 2013. Uh back in 2013 it was a lot easier to make money through traditional TV advertising and cable
[4142.40 → 4149.52] subscriptions that those numbers have only fallen since then and when you account for you know inflation
[4149.52 → 4155.60] your production costs have not gone down so you've got the've got these lines that are trending in
[4155.60 → 4162.32] in the opposite directions that would be helpful for making a production sustainable and so as much
[4162.32 → 4168.40] as you might say Comcast sucks and as much as i might not necessarily disagree with you, i think the
[4168.40 → 4172.24] thing that sucks about them was that they ever thought this was going to work in the first place this
[4172.24 → 4176.88] was just clearly a stupid idea there 's's a bunch of people in chat like what one person um
[4176.88 → 4182.40] um Sydney broke it says Comcast did very little marketing they had an abysmal business and
[4182.40 → 4187.68] marketing plan they could not figure out how to uh make things people wanted to watch and that's
[4187.68 → 4192.96] yeah maybe the production is fantastic, and the hosting is fantastic but if you like what marketing
[4192.96 → 4198.88] do we do i didn't know marketing is dead sure but i didn't know where to watch g4 i don't were they
[4198.88 → 4204.88] on YouTube i don't think so why would you care like if you don't if you didn't find it then you'd
[4204.88 → 4211.04] like you won't find it like if it was perfect we rely on virality these days algorithmically if
[4211.04 → 4217.44] it was if it was suitable for our given viewer it would get served to them yeah so I'm looking at
[4217.44 → 4222.48] g4 TV's YouTube channel, and they're getting like three or four thousand views a video um
[4225.60 → 4229.36] that's just not going to do it for the staff that they had i don't I don't know if
[4229.36 → 4235.04] everything actually hit the YouTube channel um a lot of places use YouTube channel as like
[4235.04 → 4242.88] partial archive side business thing um but yeah they uh the budget was extremely high and
[4242.88 → 4246.80] when budgets are extremely high you're going to have to perform at a level that can pay for the budget
[4246.80 → 4250.48] and it seems like that wasn't happening um
[4254.00 → 4262.80] so that's it yeah sucks uh but i do think that a lot of these people are going to land on their feet
[4263.60 → 4270.00] my clop lip says the guy whose entire business is supported by marketing uh yes but not
[4270.00 → 4278.32] marketing the show the content speaks for itself we don't we don't market Linus tech tips we don't
[4278.32 → 4284.88] like buy what like what would you even a lot of marketing for something like a lot of marketing for
[4284.88 → 4292.08] something like a YouTube channel is through recommended stuff right um and is the platform
[4292.08 → 4296.16] that you're on i again i don't know if they were fully on YouTube but if they were fully on YouTube
[4296.16 → 4301.12] um then getting three to four thousand views with the team that they had is just not
[4301.12 → 4306.48] going to support the um the math just doesn't work right um
[4309.76 → 4314.40] i don't know ran rail and twitch chat says I'm sure you guys know better than i but i assume it
[4314.40 → 4318.80] failed because of corporate bloat and idiotic budgeting costs on infrastructure that isn't needed
[4318.80 → 4324.16] for what they were producing, but that's the thing apparently it was like perfect it's just
[4324.16 → 4331.12] I've heard a lot of perfect things yeah it does cost a lot it legitimately costs a lot to
[4331.12 → 4338.96] approach a production like that in a traditional media manner uh and to make it good and so that's
[4338.96 → 4344.24] why i mean that's why i think it was dumb that they even tried not because you know the hosts weren't
[4344.24 → 4349.28] great or the showrunners weren't great or whatever else but because it was pretty clear to me that there
[4349.28 → 4359.04] just wasn't enough money in it to sustain something like that as as a startup like if it's very
[4359.04 → 4360.24] very, very difficult
[4363.84 → 4371.20] yeah either way condolences for the team there um i know I've said it like 14 times but i think
[4371.20 → 4376.72] they're going to be okay there's i know of two different outfits that are currently putting out like
[4376.72 → 4383.20] hey if you worked there hit us up because we're we're hiring people like you um so i think they'll
[4383.20 → 4389.52] be all right but i hope that's true for all of them obviously you want people to be able to find
[4389.52 → 4391.28] gainful employee um
[4394.08 → 4400.08] apparently they attack their followers a lot i yeah i don't know how much that would necessarily
[4400.08 → 4415.60] um hey we don't like to admit that fair enough oh man apparently talent were expected to play a role
[4415.60 → 4421.20] in managing public relations and little action would be taken by the company in times of controversy
[4421.20 → 4424.24] i don't know what that means um
[4426.88 → 4432.00] yeah i don't know a ton about it, i just i hope that uh i heard it was good from some people that
[4432.00 → 4438.88] i trust and i hope that the people that were doing a good job in order to make it good land on
[4438.88 → 4449.04] their feet and that's pretty much it yeah rips g4 again see you later yeah it's uh it's especially
[4449.04 → 4454.96] troubling just how sudden the shutdown was employees were informed via email that the la facility would
[4454.96 → 4459.60] be closed, and all streams postponed but no word that the network was actually shutting it down
[4459.60 → 4464.96] many employees only found out via a memo published on Twitter that's just gross yeah I'm
[4467.20 → 4473.68] really not enjoying this like modern people getting fired through figuring it out through hearing it on
[4473.68 → 4480.08] the news thing um I'm sure to be fair that was a thing in the past as well but it I've been hearing
[4480.08 → 4491.92] a few of those lately um so yeah uh there's a bunch of employees uh said there was a ton of
[4491.92 → 4497.92] mismanagement and a lack of direction in an interview with the Washington Post uh apparently they wasted a
[4497.92 → 4504.56] bunch of funding on guest stars and cut staff and uh people said they were underpaid um
[4506.32 → 4514.48] yeah all right discussion question LTT video game channel when it feels like a matter of time doesn't
[4514.48 → 4524.00] it i want to do one for a long time, but it's hard there isn't there isn't a ton of money in it um
[4524.00 → 4531.12] um gaming is something that the people that are doing well on YouTube in gaming are
[4532.32 → 4539.84] huge, and they're doing well because their volume is just enormous um and a lot of them have honestly
[4539.84 → 4544.32] pivoted slightly out of gaming so that they can get their advertising dollars from segments that
[4544.32 → 4550.16] aren't just gaming they can use their audience to uh their audience that is interested in not just
[4550.16 → 4553.92] the fact that they talk about games, but they're interested in the person so I'm not saying they're
[4553.92 → 4559.76] using their audience negatively uh, but they're making forms of content that aren't just
[4559.76 → 4565.76] gaming content uh because maybe they don't want to just make gaming content, and also they get to put
[4565.76 → 4571.68] that video in a different advertising segment than just gaming which is often a perfect thing for
[4571.68 → 4582.16] for money um so yeah i don't know it's tough it's such a saturated space it's also like honest yeah
[4582.16 → 4591.76] the fans are vicious that's true just to put that out there and I've I've been one of them
[4591.76 → 4594.80] um there was I i don't know if you guys remember this but
[4598.00 → 4602.80] do i bring this up yeah let's go for it um cuphead do you remember the launch of
[4602.80 → 4607.36] cup head i think we even talked about this on Sancho back in the back in the day there was a there was a
[4607.36 → 4616.96] game reviewer who couldn't make it through the tutorial oh no it was actually hilarious uh and
[4616.96 → 4626.40] and a lot of a lot of reviews coming out about games that are hard or like let's say cup head the
[4626.40 → 4627.60] cup head one was like
[4627.60 → 4636.80] pretty bad um watching the person's play through where they spend whatever it is like 25 minutes
[4636.80 → 4642.24] trying to get through the tutorial that should take people like 30 seconds was uh was pretty
[4642.24 → 4648.96] intense um but watching reviewers rate difficult games really poorly because they couldn't accomplish
[4648.96 → 4656.80] it um is not fun it's not good um but i think i feel like the gaming audiences is
[4656.80 → 4662.16] is more ready to go after the reviewer in those situations than a lot of other audiences
[4662.16 → 4670.08] uh which is fine and fair um but when the money's low and the audience is brutal
[4670.96 → 4676.40] it makes the business decision competition is high, and the competition is very high because there's a
[4676.40 → 4682.32] lot of game reviewers and there are a lot of good game reviewers as well we named two of them on the
[4682.32 → 4687.12] show it's not like it's not like there's a there's a hole there that we need to fill
[4687.92 → 4693.28] um yeah so like what could we do differently in that space there's a bunch of people that do
[4693.28 → 4699.76] really long form like video essay type content on games that is just amazing like the amount of
[4699.76 → 4706.32] research that goes into it is incredible they make these works of art there's a lot of people that make
[4706.32 → 4713.76] shorter form more review punchy type of stuff that is also perfect like it doesn't need us to join
[4713.76 → 4720.96] it i would enjoy making gaming content definitely doesn't need us in that space so it's a difficult
[4720.96 → 4727.76] I'd be happy to talk about uh beat safer map packs yeah but like other than that it's like what would I
[4727.76 → 4734.16] even contribute and honestly like that's cool how many views is that going to get how do we make how
[4734.16 → 4739.60] do we make a good business call out of Linus talking about map packs on beat safer i think it
[4739.60 → 4746.88] would probably be a thing where it's just like a passion project um, but then you're you're you're
[4746.88 → 4752.48] paying people's wages for a passion project because it's going to need to get edited and then if we
[4752.48 → 4758.96] make a mistake over there uh the people that are angry about it are going to cleave all the other
[4758.96 → 4765.52] companies and groups that we have which is pretty extensive at this point um so it's just it's tough
[4765.52 → 4770.48] it's tough someone on twitch chat talking about that uh untitled goose game stream that you and i did
[4770.48 → 4776.32] saying it was funny to watch like yeah it was but from like a work standpoint that was the least
[4776.32 → 4782.08] productive thing that either Luke or i could have been doing yeah like what what what were we making
[4782.08 → 4787.92] like three dollars an hour to play untitled goose game i have no idea the opportunity cost of
[4787.92 → 4796.40] that is enormous yeah, and you know we've got people on twitch also pointing out that
[4796.40 → 4801.44] you don't have to do reviews you can do niche content yeah but niche content it's right in the name
[4802.08 → 4807.68] how do you make money on it and there's you know there's people that can and be very successful
[4807.68 → 4813.76] and make perfect money, but it's often one to two bit outfits we're big exactly like that's the
[4813.76 → 4820.08] thing is you can make money as an individual, but we're not an individual anymore yeah like all of a
[4820.08 → 4827.52] sudden anything we do has to make more than just the person working on it because there are other teams
[4827.52 → 4833.28] that support those people if you're just an individual fine but if you have to also pay your share of the
[4833.28 → 4837.52] overhead from our accounting department and logistics department and to be clear you know
[4837.52 → 4845.04] it's not fair to call accounting overhead, but they don't make money they count it right and what
[4845.04 → 4850.96] they do is super important keeping us compliant with various tax regulations and things like
[4850.96 → 4858.32] that you know we can't operate without them, but it means that we can't just take every dollar that
[4858.32 → 4862.48] comes in and go oh well that covers the salary of the people who work on this show it's just more
[4862.48 → 4869.28] complicated and like the galactic asks what's the rationale behind carpool critics uh the rationale
[4869.28 → 4878.08] there is that they really wanted to do a movie podcast and i said i okay uh give it a shot, and we'll see how
[4878.08 → 4882.80] it goes, and they really, really like doing it still i guess because otherwise they don't have to
[4882.80 → 4890.80] i mean they're just movies they're just movies podcasts yeah and like for me the type of
[4890.80 → 4899.44] content that i would want to make if i made content like that would be content similar to uh like ahoy or
[4899.44 → 4908.32] naker Jake or channels like that and there's no way i would be as good so you should probably just watch
[4908.32 → 4913.68] them and I'm just being real about that i would probably just want to like i would probably i
[4913.68 → 4919.04] think untitled goose game is honestly a perfect sandbox for me that that is my gaming personality
[4919.92 → 4927.28] in a nutshell really is uh i probably had the most fun that I've had gaming in the last like five years
[4927.28 → 4935.44] playing star citizen with you and Riley for his tech longer episode just being an absolute piece of
[4935.44 → 4942.32] garbage the entire time like i had way more fun ruining this utterly broken game for everyone
[4942.32 → 4948.16] than i would have actually trying to role-play in it yeah you know we should release that
[4948.16 → 4955.60] as a float plane exclusive if Riley still has the uncut footage because that was hilarious it was so fun
[4955.60 → 4961.36] i wish it made i don't think it made it into the cut or maybe, maybe like one version of it did or
[4961.36 → 4967.44] something but Linus figured out how to like KO your character I'm going to say it that way
[4968.32 → 4972.88] um and i it was like holding backspace or something and your character would just knock themselves out
[4972.88 → 4978.08] and you'd fall on the floor we started running around the hangar both of us just like launching
[4980.96 → 4986.96] and just rag dolling in the middle of this like starwort and morphologist who's a fantastic
[4986.96 → 4992.32] creator he's a architect who does reviews of the ships and stars, and he does other stuff as well
[4992.32 → 4997.12] uh, but he's trying to like show us this game and how cool it can be able to like
[4998.56 → 4998.80] boom
[5002.56 → 5010.40] i managed to almost PK the entire squad yeah yeah yeah no i thought you did get everyone
[5011.20 → 5015.92] no i didn't get everyone they got the gun away from me no because you crashed the ship into the planet
[5016.72 → 5017.84] oh well yeah i did that
[5020.80 → 5023.04] yeah i do remember the gun part though yeah
[5024.72 → 5026.88] oh i was so close to getting you all
[5028.24 → 5034.00] yeah i i i would have fun i could have some fun making so I've had some video ideas in my head for
[5034.00 → 5041.12] like years uh that i would really like to explore um yeah me too honestly it's the thing that kind of
[5041.12 → 5046.08] sucks about doing this professionally because there are video ideas that i would love to do that
[5046.08 → 5052.24] have been like swimming around in my head twinkle in the eye you know that are just not worth the
[5052.24 → 5057.52] time yeah, and it's like what is worth you know yeah like there's a there's a few that I've
[5057.52 → 5062.40] wanted to do I've even started writing scripts on a few of them over the years and then just been
[5062.40 → 5070.32] like this is so this is way too similar to what i do for work releasing this on my personal channel would probably be really weird
[5070.88 → 5076.40] i don't like really want to do that so then they haven't become anything, but it's still something that like
[5076.40 → 5082.24] like but then if i do it during work hours the whole time i try to do it I'm just going to be
[5082.24 → 5088.00] like holy crap there are other things i should be doing so i don't know it just doesn't really line up
[5088.96 → 5093.76] i feel the same way about a lot of stuff i mean even stuff that i really like kind of should be doing
[5093.76 → 5099.76] for work like the know Colton's been chasing me to do a course forever and like i should write
[5099.76 → 5105.92] that book and stuff like that it's just i know it's not the quote unquote the best use of my time but
[5105.92 → 5111.52] there are things that i kind of feel like would be a lot more creatively fulfilling um but just
[5112.56 → 5120.08] are i you know i think the big problem is I'm really just not done with LTT yet i feel like once
[5120.08 → 5129.20] we get labs up and running smoothly um once we have you know like this great host stable, and we've got
[5129.20 → 5135.68] labs just like churning through product in the background you know maybe the time will come yeah
[5135.68 → 5142.00] maybe the time will come for maybe you need to spend more time fighting Dennis on channel super
[5142.00 → 5147.92] fun or something you know yeah maybe uh you could have your own um i haven't been doing it as much
[5147.92 → 5154.24] lately because we're we're crunching pretty hard we're behind on a bunch of things but flow plane in
[5154.24 → 5160.40] theory has this thing where on the last Friday of every month uh except for right now uh we do something
[5160.40 → 5166.16] where we do creative day when people are supposed to work on their own like something that they find
[5166.16 → 5171.04] interesting that might potentially be a benefit, but we don't measure it based on like benefits and
[5171.04 → 5175.68] stuff it's just could it potentially bring any value to the company and there's been some really
[5175.68 → 5179.28] cool stuff that is that has come from that that has actually been really valued there's also been
[5179.28 → 5184.80] stuff that has come from that that has had effectively no real major value and that's completely fine
[5184.80 → 5191.44] uh, but it's a cool creative outlet um so if is you're able to have the time to be able to do
[5191.44 → 5197.12] that but one of the problems with those types of systems is being able to have that time is hard
[5197.84 → 5205.52] um so yeah yeah Conrad just pointed out points merch messages was originally a creative day
[5205.52 → 5212.32] thing yeah it was a there was a suggestion from a viewer i don't remember exactly how detailed it was
[5212.32 → 5220.88] and then Conrad took it way further and turned it into merch messages um and now that's like a
[5220.88 → 5226.08] core part of LAN show and a notable part of the business really really really cool there's been other
[5226.08 → 5231.84] stuff that has come out that has been uh very good from creative day as well um, and it's something that i
[5231.84 → 5238.16] i want to get back into we're just behind on some stuff but um yeah i think those things can be
[5238.16 → 5243.44] valuable i think virus having some time to just riff on things that he finds interesting would be cool
[5243.44 → 5245.76] um, but time is very leveraged right now
[5248.80 → 5251.44] yeah i don't know video game reviews it's something it's something we've been thinking
[5251.44 → 5256.96] about for years because before we started channel super fun it was like uh which one do we do type of
[5256.96 → 5263.52] conversation um yeah yeah it was either video games or toys and toys and other more different kinds of games
[5263.52 → 5273.60] yeah yeah uh Ea speaking of games is shutting down servers for many old but still good games
[5274.48 → 5279.68] uh this was first spotted by true achievements on Monday, but Electronic Arts has confirmed it has
[5279.68 → 5284.48] started the process of shutting down online servers for some of their older games which means
[5284.48 → 5290.64] players will no longer be able to play multiplayer online and any achievements that require that feature
[5290.64 → 5299.60] will be forever unwinnable IGN assembled a list of when and what games are getting shut down, and it is
[5299.60 → 5306.88] October 20th 2022 army of two the 40th day and army of two the devil's cartel as well as dragon age
[5306.88 → 5314.56] origins the multiplayer screenshots server on November 9th 2022 they're shutting down command and conquer
[5314.56 → 5319.04] red alert 3 command and conquer 3 Tiberius wars and command and conquer 3 Kane's wrath
[5319.04 → 5326.64] alongside mercenaries 2 world in flames November 30th sees the end of onrush and January 19th of 2023
[5327.20 → 5332.64] we'll see the end of mirror's edge NBA jam on fire edition gating gears and shank 2
[5334.56 → 5342.88] oh rest in peace i really wish there was legislation to force these guys to release community server
[5342.88 → 5352.16] software why not because they are clearly shutting it down anyway very, very frustrating yeah Anthony's
[5352.16 → 5358.32] uh discussion question it's not really a question but uh bring back dedicated servers you cowards
[5358.96 → 5364.72] games with servers shut down like this should have their server software released ab so freaking
[5364.72 → 5372.48] likely preach it Anthony yeah i uh i feel the same way there 's's a question which is like Adam says
[5374.08 → 5381.36] uh mirrors edges online content only consists of leaderboards and ghost downloads how hard is it to keep those going
[5384.56 → 5393.84] yeah unreal extremely frustrating entire generations of gaming experiences will be lost
[5393.84 → 5398.00] to this always online multiplayer paradigm
[5400.56 → 5404.32] it's really quite sad um I've always really
[5406.08 → 5406.96] because you don't
[5408.72 → 5413.44] like maybe you don't care too much right now about some of these things closing down
[5413.44 → 5417.52] maybe you haven't thought about mirror's edge for a while right um
[5417.52 → 5423.20] um, but there are a bunch of games where i don't think about them for a decade
[5424.64 → 5429.28] and then one day I'll talk to a buddy about it, and we'll reminisce over some good times with some
[5429.28 → 5434.24] game that i forgot the name of oh yeah remember worms Armageddon yeah it's like man we should play
[5434.24 → 5439.68] worms Armageddon that's actually really fun and with worms Armageddon you can, and you can have a
[5439.68 → 5446.40] just fire up some Karachi and yeah, and it's really quite genuinely entertaining it's fun to go back and play that game
[5446.40 → 5454.24] some fun parts of it can even be going wow this is a bad game um just figuring out like okay in the last however
[5454.24 → 5461.92] many years a lot of good quality of life things have happened to gaming like that part is interesting I'm not saying that with worms Armageddon to be clear
[5461.92 → 5468.40] uh, but that has been something that has happened to me a couple of times that I've I've put some rose-tinted glasses on about a certain game
[5468.40 → 5474.24] gone back to play it and then I'm like oh wow okay usually i think i have a pretty good memory for that stuff but not all the time
[5474.24 → 5482.24] but i want to be able to do that um and i think it's crazy that it's becoming a thing
[5482.24 → 5489.76] that you can't um and this is something that we talked about on Sancho when it started becoming more popular
[5489.76 → 5495.52] that games are becoming always online multiplayer experience blah blah blah blah um and no one seemed to care
[5495.52 → 5501.52] yeah, and now it's starting to happen and i think we're running into a situation where a decent amount
[5501.52 → 5506.64] of people don't care and i think the reason why is it havingn't happened to a game that they care about
[5506.64 → 5512.48] and it's going to be one of those things where it's like they came for the x and i didn't care because it
[5512.48 → 5517.12] didn't affect me they came for the y i didn't care because it didn't affect me now they're coming for me
[5517.12 → 5524.48] who's there to care about this i don't remember how that quote works um but like i think that's
[5524.48 → 5534.48] happening you should care this sucks this is bad the there are groups out there that try to um
[5534.48 → 5544.48] preserve old gaming experiences um and i think that's more that uh matrix online MMO uh like server
[5544.48 → 5552.32] reverse engineering project was wild yeah i don't think it ever ultimately succeeded but like
[5552.96 → 5558.24] with that kind of dedication you have to know that if the source code was released they would have made
[5558.24 → 5566.80] it happens yep probably would have made it better yeah um so i don't know this is sad the question
[5566.80 → 5572.00] of what gave me most disappointed to see offline uh i don't know I'm just disappointed to see any of them
[5572.00 → 5579.44] offline i think yeah no none of these games should be offline it should be only if nobody wants to play
[5579.44 → 5587.12] it anymore, but instead we're not given the option we're not given the choice yeah and even if no one
[5587.12 → 5594.08] wants to play it anymore maybe someone wants to play it further out on the line and to be clear i don't
[5594.08 → 5602.32] think stop looking to the error off camera yeah sorry I'll look at cardboard Linus a little bit more
[5602.32 → 5610.96] often um i don't think anyone is i don't think that these companies should have to necessarily like
[5611.52 → 5617.52] host the online servers for these in perpetuity forever they should do um
[5617.52 → 5624.00] um what i think someone else mentioned i think Anthony or maybe Linus they should make it
[5624.00 → 5631.12] so that other people can if they want um like uh DD and twitch chat says uh battle for just one game
[5631.12 → 5634.88] where the community fought hard with the a actually ended up getting the source code as long
[5634.88 → 5639.84] as they swore never to monetize the game, and it's a similar situation good enough uh supreme commander
[5639.84 → 5644.96] forged alliance exactly good enough we don't want to make money off the IP we just want to play our
[5644.96 → 5652.48] freaking game yes forged alliance is i think it's actually brilliant because they handed it over to
[5652.48 → 5659.36] community members that are doing an amazing job the lord's work the forged alliance team uh
[5660.64 → 5665.68] it's actually just wild what they've accomplished really really really impressive, and they made an
[5665.68 → 5672.80] agreement you have to have a legit copy of the game to be able to play, so people still buy it because
[5672.80 → 5679.12] you can buy it through steam the original company it's actually a win-win yeah everybody wins sounds
[5679.12 → 5686.64] good you I'm not even asking you to stop profiting off of it exactly all i want is for there to be a
[5686.64 → 5691.92] route and if people don't want to put the effort in if you have made the path clear if people don't
[5691.92 → 5698.64] want to put the effort in that's fine, but the path needs to be clear there needs to be a path
[5698.64 → 5706.32] just shutting it down creating no potential path forward that's not cool i don't like that at all
[5706.32 → 5713.84] and i would really love it if something happened i don't know if it has to happen legally or what
[5713.84 → 5718.32] uh but something happened so that this couldn't happen anymore because we're we're legitimately losing
[5718.32 → 5725.68] history, and it's not it's not good or cool yeah someone said Acheron's call apparently there's multiple
[5725.68 → 5732.24] community servers now because you can do that that's great Acheron's call is an ancient MMO um
[5734.00 → 5738.48] and i suspect Microsoft does not expect that they're going to be able to make money off of
[5738.48 → 5745.44] the original Acheron's call um and that might be a very accurate thing um but yeah just let the
[5745.44 → 5750.96] community host some stuff and if you want to put in stuff hey you can't profit off of this, or they have
[5750.96 → 5756.56] to have official uh license keys for the software to be able to play on your server whatever sure
[5757.12 → 5759.68] whatever just make it possible
[5762.64 → 5771.76] uh or alternate solution you can just get rich enough to buy these companies outright like Kanye West
[5772.40 → 5780.72] acclaimed rapper ye is buying social media platform parlour after being banned from Instagram and
[5780.72 → 5786.72] twitter for making uh what were i havingn't actually seen them but what were apparently anti-Semitic
[5786.72 → 5793.12] comments Kanye West now legally known as ye i actually didn't know he legally changed his name
[5793.12 → 5801.12] to ye that's a thing um has decided to take matters into his own hands by purchasing parlour in a Tuesday
[5801.12 → 5806.00] press release parent company parliament technologies i don't know how you're supposed to pronounce that
[5806.00 → 5814.72] parliament uh announced it agrees to be sold to ye in the same release ye said in a world where
[5814.72 → 5818.88] conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure they have
[5818.88 → 5826.00] the right to freely we have the right to freely express ourselves CEO George farmer said this deal will
[5826.00 → 5832.32] change the world and change the way the world thinks about free speech ye is making a groundbreaking
[5832.32 → 5837.76] move into the free speech media space and will never have to fear being removed from social media
[5837.76 → 5845.84] again parliament than doxxed numerous verified users and investors by cc'ing instead of bcc'ING the
[5845.84 → 5858.64] announcement apparently it's yay not ye is it yay uh oh really wait so it's yay right, but they're called
[5858.64 → 5866.24] Yeezy what they would be Yeezy they'd be Yeezy I'm concerned we're getting trolled
[5869.44 → 5872.48] it's yay like Kanye yeah that's what i thought
[5874.56 → 5877.92] yay it's yay then so they're Yeezy oh wait that's not what i thought
[5877.92 → 5879.04] Kanye
[5882.00 → 5888.48] Kanye West there is some conjecture that yay all right sorry might be getting played
[5888.48 → 5896.24] for a sucker by parliament technologies tech dirt noted that parlour has around 50 000 daily
[5896.24 → 5903.84] active users and that the twitter for people removed from twitter it has a limited audience that is now
[5903.84 → 5910.40] split between multiple social networks like parlour and truth social uh they have apparently been trying
[5910.40 → 5914.40] to offload parlour for some time but have demanded very high prices
[5914.40 → 5921.12] uh yay has recently garnered controversy after being spotted wearing a white lives matter shirt
[5921.12 → 5928.40] and going on tirades on social media and making false statements regarding George Floyd's death along
[5928.40 → 5935.20] with other rants uh there are some discussion questions here but frankly i don't think we're going to get
[5935.20 → 5944.72] into any of them discussion question a what is a free speech media platform discussion question b are you
[5944.72 → 5952.40] a yays tan or a hater c would you ever invest in a social media platform which one
[5954.48 → 5961.52] and oh actually d is pretty good this is from jams doesn't yay know that Elon plans to pardon most
[5961.52 → 5967.84] twitter bans and bring back trump which would leave how many people on parlour I'm thinking a big fat
[5967.84 → 5974.96] less than the 50 000 they have today apparently uh Elon also plans to drop like i think it's like two
[5974.96 → 5979.52] thirds of the twitter staff or something like that i thought it was three quarters wow so
[5980.08 → 5987.60] uh given actually you know what hold on a second if he actually does that and actually just like
[5987.60 → 5993.68] slashes the entire content moderation staff and twitter turns into an even more toxic cesspool than
[5993.68 → 6000.00] it is today nice it might be a perfect time to own parlour and be an alternative to it
[6006.08 → 6009.84] yeah really fun one uh i don't maybe you mentioned this and i just didn't hear it but
[6009.84 → 6016.96] uh parliament part i don't know whatever the parent company uh docs numerous verified
[6016.96 → 6023.84] users and investors by CC'ing them instead of backing the announcement yeah that's great that is that
[6023.84 → 6038.40] is an plus um we run a tech company move right there yeah sheesh yeah i uh i don't have too much
[6039.84 → 6046.40] to say about this other than hey plants need water and float plane chat Obama made my frogs gay too
[6046.40 → 6054.88] let's move on uh better pixels there's a report claiming that is reallocating resources from
[6054.88 → 6062.40] software to first party hardware uh this is from Ars Technica a report from the information details
[6062.40 → 6068.40] changes google CEO Sandra pacha is making across the company including cuts to divisions focused on
[6068.40 → 6074.64] software for non-google devices and more resources for Google's first party hardware divisions why well
[6074.64 → 6079.76] apparently google views apple as more of a threat than it has previously Samsung is apparently in
[6079.76 → 6085.52] decline in many established markets and apple is topping us market share at greater than 50 percent
[6086.40 → 6094.56] and global premium smartphone sales at 78 of the thousand dollar segment uh google is worrying too
[6094.56 → 6100.24] that regulators might shut down its agreement with apple to put google search on iPhones a loss of
[6100.24 → 6106.00] Google Ads on iPhones would be apparently a major blow to google's revenue the effects may already be
[6106.00 → 6111.68] noticeable somewhere OS watch users are reporting that assistant no longer works on their device oh
[6111.68 → 6118.48] wow what the heck apparently Samsung OnePlus and Xiaomi are being singled out as premium android
[6118.48 → 6125.44] partners, but many other manufacturers may not get the same attention the discussion question here is what
[6125.44 → 6129.92] effect will google abandoning other android partners have in the long run i would say not good ones
[6129.92 → 6134.64] because one of the biggest perceived problems with android is the lack of long-term software support
[6135.36 → 6140.72] and b is it wise for Google to switch to a more apple-like model if you'd asked me five years ago
[6141.76 → 6147.44] six seven years ago in the nexus days I'd have said yes it's extremely wise for Google to go more
[6147.44 → 6152.48] vertically integrated if you asked me today i would say that sounds like a terrible idea
[6152.48 → 6162.00] um they have proven time and time again that they just can't handle it um for lack of a better way of
[6162.00 → 6169.60] putting that yeah yeah i don't know i in my opinion
[6171.76 → 6176.24] the quality level of a lot of Google's hardware was best when they didn't make it
[6176.24 → 6189.04] uh like the nexus devices sorry i just kicked you um the nexus device is out there you go there you go
[6189.04 → 6196.72] um the nexus devices were sweet the pixel devices almost immediately started their ups and downs a
[6196.72 → 6202.00] little bit downhill yeah um i don't remember a nexus device not being good though
[6202.00 → 6211.04] i mean they weren't perfect they were no, but they were cheap yeah yeah they were really great for
[6211.04 → 6216.88] how cheap they were um so if you go in not expecting them to be the absolute best thing on the market
[6216.88 → 6221.44] uh but to very likely be the best thing in that price segment they were perfect
[6222.32 → 6228.00] um i don't know as as a pixel person i have been disappointed over the last few years
[6228.00 → 6231.36] years um more than few years i guess
[6234.00 → 6239.60] yeah I'm not too surprised i we've been hearing for quite a while about how apple's market share
[6239.60 → 6243.44] has been increasing increasing increasing you wonder who they're taking that from its like well
[6245.44 → 6248.48] probably Windows phone that's for sure yeah yeah exactly
[6250.72 → 6252.08] so yeah
[6254.24 → 6257.76] yeah i don't know i think it's time for us to get to some merch messages what do you think
[6257.76 → 6260.80] sure let's do it okay that sounds good to me
[6263.52 → 6270.00] hit it Dan well I'm going to get there um okay this is from Garrett uh Linus Ubisoft sent out an email
[6270.00 → 6276.24] today that they are uh bringing Anna 1800 consoles and are having people try it out are you going to
[6276.24 → 6282.56] try Anna 1800 on a console uh yeah while I'm at it, I'm going to play some warcraft 2 on PlayStation 1.
[6282.56 → 6284.64] excellent
[6285.84 → 6291.20] technically a thing that you can do that sounds like a terrible very, very stupid yeah I feel like
[6291.20 → 6298.48] you should really play it on a computer uh yeah wow I feel like it would I mean I'm glad that the
[6298.48 → 6304.88] I'm glad the franchise is getting this kind of support from Ubisoft I'm glad that it's successful it's it
[6304.88 → 6311.28] really is a very different gaming experience than almost any other quote-unquote RTS yeah um it's a
[6311.28 → 6316.88] really cool game yeah I don't see why it needs to be on console it already runs really well on pc you
[6316.88 → 6322.40] can run it on like integrated intel graphics um if anything it's poorly optimized for high-end hardware
[6322.40 → 6328.08] but it does really well on low-end hardware like low details i I don't see why this needs to be on
[6328.08 → 6335.68] console I think playing high difficulty Anna on console will be really hard um yes just with how
[6335.68 → 6340.00] fast you can get things done because a lot of at a lot of times you're kind of fighting against the
[6340.00 → 6345.76] clock in that game um yeah you got to make decisions quickly, and you have to make them very well you have
[6345.76 → 6351.28] to do the various emergencies everything's on fire you know that kind of thing pirates are coming like
[6351.28 → 6355.44] there 's's stuff going on you have to react really fast hopefully they do a perfect job of it
[6355.44 → 6362.64] um because more fans of Anna would be more cool uh but yeah it sounds really tough Conrad says uh
[6362.64 → 6369.44] star craft 64 it's a good example yeah, yeah maybe not uh this one's from Tyler uh hey Linus
[6369.44 → 6373.68] what are your next plans for your smart home I have been following your journey and using it to avoid
[6373.68 → 6381.28] issues you had or take ideas that worked well oh well one of the things I really need to figure out
[6381.28 → 6386.96] is what switches uh in a valley is apparently still working on their motion sensing switch so
[6387.68 → 6395.04] hopefully that'll come sometime in the new year and I can replace those uh GE task ones task did
[6395.04 → 6399.60] ultimately do the right thing in release firmware updates but I'm still having a lot of just general
[6399.60 → 6405.92] bugginess with them so I would like to just wholesale replace them at this point and in a valley's new
[6405.92 → 6411.28] upcoming switch uses millimetre wave for presence detection which is apparently a lot more accurate
[6411.28 → 6422.08] than motion sensing so with that swap out done I think that the next goal would be motion sensing and
[6422.08 → 6428.88] timed light intensity throughout the house because right now it's like you're it's cool to walk around
[6428.88 → 6433.44] and all futuristic like lights just magically turn on as you're walking around the house but the brightness
[6433.44 → 6438.48] is almost never correct so you end up touching the light switch a lot anyway, and it would be really
[6438.48 → 6445.44] nice to be able to schedule that kind of stuff um I'd say that's the next big one also I still have not
[6445.44 → 6451.92] even touched those eco bees that are alongside the American standard thermostats in all the locations so
[6452.56 → 6457.76] I'm going to need to figure out now that it's getting chilly for the winter how to make sure that the
[6457.76 → 6463.20] heat and the cool are not fighting with each other so that's going to be a project for Jake
[6463.44 → 6470.64] realistically but um I will have to assign it to Jake so that's my role uh someone pointed out you can
[6470.64 → 6474.88] plug in keyboard and mouse to consoles these days um I don't know how many people do that
[6475.52 → 6483.76] I suspect it's very interesting I'd be really interested to know how yeah yeah it sounds like a
[6484.48 → 6490.48] good video for your new gaming channel maybe not how do you pull those people though
[6490.48 → 6494.48] because it's not going to be it's not going to be like putting up a poll on flow plane chat is not
[6494.48 → 6502.96] going to accurately answer that question at all now that we know that 15 of them lie yeah um but
[6502.96 → 6508.48] even then like you're you're pulling the wrong group of people um you'd need a wider group of
[6508.48 → 6512.08] non-technical people to get a more accurate answer on how many people are going to play out
[6512.08 → 6514.80] dang zing wow
[6517.36 → 6525.68] what did you just call console people non-technical people no hot take Luke I didn't
[6527.52 → 6531.12] i was saying that we have a concentrated audience of technical people here
[6531.76 → 6537.84] and yeah and to find out how people game on console you'd have to ask non-technical people
[6537.84 → 6543.20] to find out how people game on computers you'd have to do the same thing because if you pulled
[6543.20 → 6550.00] the right line if you pulled the full flight audience no you're cancelled if you pull honestly
[6550.00 → 6554.00] console players are probably less technical than computer players that just wasn't my point
[6554.00 → 6559.60] we did it as a second time this isn't my point i uh the
[6561.44 → 6566.88] if you why do you hate console gamers if you wanted to figure out the resolution of monitors that people had
[6566.88 → 6572.08] on steam, and you pulled the float plane audience it's going to be wrong because you'd have to find
[6572.08 → 6580.72] the delays no the delay's over chat's exploding the average steam user which is not the average
[6580.72 → 6586.00] person in float plane chat it's a problem the sample size is wrong, and you're also saying
[6586.00 → 6594.40] that they have lower IQs as well oh my goodness look how could you look oh
[6596.16 → 6603.68] and they're, and they're ugly you have to stop texting me this stuff off the show you can't, you're
[6603.68 → 6608.56] just adding fuel to this fire I can't and their moms are ugly well I mean that makes sense I mean if
[6608.56 → 6611.60] they're ugly their moms are probably ugly like it's got to come from somewhere
[6611.60 → 6617.84] uh shall we move on before um this becomes an issue we don't want to be trending on Twitter again
[6617.84 → 6624.08] yeah uh this is this one's from IAN uh good evening guys love the channel and all you do
[6624.08 → 6630.72] my wife and I are expecting our first can't wait to play space kids in dos box with a little one
[6630.72 → 6636.16] in my lap just like my dad did with me what gaming memories do you have and want to share recreate with
[6636.16 → 6642.40] your own kids you know what I actually went through this pretty recently there's this um I think it's
[6642.40 → 6651.04] called pc emu pc PCN uh it's a pc emulator, and it allows you to actually emulate like a Windows 95
[6651.04 → 6660.08] Windows 98 older era CPU on a modern computer, and it's one of the few ways to play old like point and
[6660.08 → 6665.76] click adventure games from that time and one of the games that my kids actually had a blast playing
[6665.76 → 6672.96] is called mixed up mother goose and game experiences like that simply do not exist anymore I think
[6672.96 → 6680.48] they're just kind of considered too low-fi for today, and it was an it was a really uh it was really cool
[6680.48 → 6688.40] seeing them play and enjoy the exact games that you know I was playing back in like 1993 you know three
[6688.40 → 6694.40] or whatever back when that came out um there are actually a lot of those kinds of games that was how
[6694.40 → 6701.92] at least two of my siblings learned to read was these interactive uh computer like books um the
[6701.92 → 6706.56] George shrinks was one of the ones that we had and there's a paper copy of it obviously but we also
[6706.56 → 6710.72] had the digital one that would read it to you, and you could kind of interact with the illustrations on
[6710.72 → 6715.04] the pages um yeah I think that's uh
[6715.04 → 6722.00] that's one that I was able to successfully share and recreate but I think that you know
[6722.80 → 6727.44] in line with what we were talking about earlier on the show that may not be an option for kids that are
[6727.44 → 6733.04] growing up today their gaming experiences might be not irretrievable
[6736.56 → 6737.44] yeah I mean
[6737.44 → 6744.32] what gaming memories do you have something that i really deeply enjoyed was borrowing talk about
[6744.32 → 6751.36] borrowing a lot I know uh borrowing was a game that my dad and I played a lot no one else
[6751.36 → 6755.76] like my brother didn't really care he wasn't that into it but my dad and I played a bunch and
[6757.20 → 6761.12] I've told the story before but I didn't realize that I had never actually started the main quest
[6761.12 → 6766.96] until we were like we had never bought a player's guide before um, but the internet was in its
[6766.96 → 6771.52] infancy still a little bit were expensive man, and they were expensive I never bought one and
[6771.52 → 6776.64] it's still the only game I've ever bought one for um but at I don't know what really compelled us to
[6776.64 → 6781.36] do it but at one point we were just like there's clearly a lot to this game we're clearly missing a
[6781.36 → 6786.80] ton let's check out a player's guide, and we did, and we got one uh and then immediately figured out
[6786.80 → 6790.96] that there was a main quest, and we just had no idea it existed because you could
[6790.96 → 6796.24] sell the item that started the main quest so I just sell it every time I don't need this thing
[6796.88 → 6806.72] um and that turned into my dad and I like playing borrowing co-op style where one of us would be
[6806.72 → 6810.56] piloting the character, and we'd trade back and forth all the time it wasn't like just me all the time or
[6810.56 → 6815.60] anything um one of us would be piloting the character and the other one would be reading from
[6815.60 → 6820.40] the player's guide and figuring out like what should we go do next and the player's guide was written in a
[6820.40 → 6828.32] really, really cool way um like if it was genuinely really well written where they would keep spoilers
[6828.32 → 6833.68] out of things, and they would keep context and information at the end of what they were talking
[6833.68 → 6838.64] about um and they communicated that to you at the beginning of the player's guide so they made it
[6838.64 → 6846.40] very clear that like there's gonna if is is you're looking up like you can use it in a way that if you see
[6846.40 → 6851.04] some cave or if you read through the player's guide, and it's like oh there's a cave here and
[6851.04 → 6855.76] you didn't know that was there or something you could use it to get you there, and then you could
[6855.76 → 6860.16] explore it on your own, and then you could check with the player's guide to make sure you got everything
[6860.16 → 6864.56] so it may, it tried to make it so that you were still exploring the world on your own, but you could
[6864.56 → 6870.00] use the player's guide to make sure that you weren't missing entire whole experiences like the whole main
[6870.00 → 6876.64] quest um and my dad and I playing borrowing is probably one of if not genuinely my favourite
[6876.64 → 6880.88] memory of gaming but i that's not I'm not going to share that if is I had a child I'm not going to
[6880.88 → 6885.68] share that with my child it's its not going to be the same way um so I don't know I have no idea
[6888.40 → 6894.88] okay let's have a look this one's from Ryan hi Linus uh did you test IOPS on the one million
[6894.88 → 6900.88] dollar server also will we ever be able to buy your blanks I prefer plain tees and quality ones
[6900.88 → 6908.24] are hard to find especially in non-bland colours well now that I only shoot blanks I'd say that uh
[6908.96 → 6914.64] it should be pretty easy to get one if you really want hey sorry I'm sure you meant
[6914.64 → 6920.24] it's hard to procreate as a piece of cardboard isn't if it is it's challenging your best could
[6920.24 → 6930.16] make paper babies um yes we do plan to make the blanks available I think that uh our costs
[6930.16 → 6935.84] have actually gone up on t-shirts we've stubbornly maintained them at 1999 throughout all the price
[6935.84 → 6942.24] increases that have gone on over the last five years um so what I think will happen is we will
[6942.24 → 6949.76] continue selling our printed tees at 1999, but we are going to absorb uh some of that additional cost by
[6949.76 → 6953.92] also selling the blank tees at the same price which I think is a perfectly good
[6953.92 → 6963.04] price for a quality shirt like the one that we have finally found um and made so it's going to
[6963.04 → 6968.88] not really yield any kind of savings for you but yes you will be able to buy a blank tee
[6969.92 → 6974.48] and it'll just be all different colours I think actually they're going to sell really, really well
[6974.48 → 6980.96] because they're great shirts and not everybody wants like a tech picture or slogan on their shirt
[6981.84 → 6988.00] especially on weekends actually I often reach for my blank because I just don't want to walk around
[6988.00 → 6997.60] like and have been even more recognizable than I was so 1999 is here to stay uh also oh actually i just
[6997.60 → 7002.96] realized we never addressed this a lot of people asked if float plane is planning to increase pricing
[7002.96 → 7009.36] in light of you know Netflix cracking down on multi-users YouTube increasing pricing for premium
[7009.36 → 7017.12] the answer is no at our scale we have not felt the need to do anything like that and especially as long
[7017.12 → 7021.36] as the platform is growing like that's one of the things that I actually addressed in the YouTube should
[7021.36 → 7027.04] charge for 4k video is that the issue is that the proliferation of content has outpaced
[7027.04 → 7035.04] uh membership growth but float plane has actually seen a huge surge in membership recently uh between
[7035.04 → 7039.28] the call me Chris collab the really great behind the scenes content that we've been doing the better
[7039.28 → 7045.52] image quality and the fact that wan show was missing for a few hours last week apparently drove about 500
[7045.52 → 7051.52] of you to sign up for float plane which is hilarious got to get that fix um but float plane is growing like
[7051.52 → 7057.28] crazy right now to the point where it's like you know dang why aren't there more creators on
[7057.28 → 7063.20] float plane I don't understand if it's like actually a really it's perfect but whatever I can't, I can
[7063.20 → 7071.44] only make the horse to water I can't make it drink yeah oh yeah okay we've got another one here from
[7071.44 → 7079.44] anonymous how's daily driving the new AirPods pros oh they're great uh if anything the active noise
[7079.44 → 7085.28] cancellation is too good I used to be able to like at least hear my kids if they really needed my
[7085.28 → 7093.36] attention and now i just really can't when I just have them in a noise-cancelling so it's blissful
[7093.36 → 7098.64] actually, and they're even better for sleeping than the old ones I'm I'm super happy with them so far i
[7098.64 → 7104.24] hope they don't develop the same driver rattle that my previous like two pairs of AirPods Pro ones did
[7104.24 → 7112.64] I mean that's always a possibility I guess this one's from lewis my brother wants to know if you
[7112.64 → 7119.60] would consider making a cologne yeah we're going to call it gamer sweat it's coming next year i uh I'm
[7119.60 → 7124.56] kidding it's not happening Luke I see the look on your face okay I'm disappointed Linus
[7126.40 → 7133.76] um I don't know like we could, but it's its one of those it always comes down to that question that i
[7133.76 → 7140.96] always talk about what are we contributing you add yeah what value are we adding here that are there
[7140.96 → 7147.84] not enough smells to choose from is there not enough toilet water in the world i just I mean
[7147.84 → 7154.32] you could take that same approach to uh t-shirts and things like that you know well no I think our
[7154.32 → 7159.68] t-shirts actually have a reason for existing you know like that like the commenter said it's actually
[7159.68 → 7165.20] really hard to find a decent quality shirt that doesn't suck that's fair I've been violently
[7165.20 → 7170.40] impressed with all your merchandise yeah there 's's me being a corps shill but no it's its
[7170.40 → 7178.16] surprising how good quality it is well the thing is that it's surprising how much how little it costs to
[7178.16 → 7183.60] make something good like you can make something crap for six dollars, and you can make something really
[7183.60 → 7188.56] good for seven dollars and fifty cents and people like it is amazing all the time it's crazy it is
[7188.56 → 7196.32] amazing how often people choose the six dollar option it drives me crazy it shouldn't be a business model
[7196.32 → 7202.88] that makes you stand out to spend the extra dollar fifty to make it twice as good as I just don't get it
[7203.84 → 7212.16] but here we are yeah it's uh it's very strange it makes me feel bad for uh having bought things before and
[7212.16 → 7217.44] than just being bad you should make I would do a deodorant before I would do it before I would do
[7217.44 → 7223.60] cologne you should make gamified deodorant that'd be cool like you have to wear it every day or you
[7223.60 → 7229.68] like lose point or something somehow yeah it so it has to like the lid has to come off every day or
[7229.68 → 7234.64] something um smart deodorant and if it doesn't, they're just gonna bought that you know you're not
[7234.64 → 7243.28] going to win like RuneScape deodorant uh here's one from Daniel uh Linus Anthony's hold on Anthony is
[7243.28 → 7250.24] suggesting scents for the uh for the cologne or deodorant we've got new electronics magic smoke
[7250.24 → 7259.04] dusting day chiller coolant and uh RTX 2080 ti foam packing foam I want one that smells like
[7259.04 → 7264.88] exploded capacitors you know that burnt electronics smell yeah magic smoke smell yeah exactly
[7264.88 → 7273.76] yeah yeah I would definitely wear that um anyway yeah I mean make that make it as a joke uh Linus
[7273.76 → 7279.44] have you ever felt limited by not having a college degree related to tech what if you did
[7279.44 → 7286.80] being interrupted what if you did uh like a LTT store discount if you actually, and we'd have to find
[7286.80 → 7291.12] some way to track it and I don't necessarily know how, but you get like a Lt store discount or like
[7291.12 → 7296.88] a free full plane subscription or something if you actually use the deodorant are you talking
[7296.88 → 7302.56] about IOT internet of things deodorant yeah so because the whole thing is just getting nerds to
[7302.56 → 7307.60] actually wear it because that that's yeah that's the problem right no, no that's easy because you would
[7307.60 → 7313.60] just make the deodorant a subscription and if they cancel this if they have the subscription they are
[7313.60 → 7319.76] they're either using it or they are accumulating copious amounts of deodorant and I know a lot of
[7319.76 → 7325.28] I know a lot of nerds and geeks and I think that we're all about min maxing right guys yeah you know
[7325.28 → 7331.36] so I don't think it's min maxing to accumulate piles of deodorant so yeah if you're going to buy it i
[7331.36 → 7336.88] think you'll I think you'll use it I think you'll use it if you're going to get it in the mail anyway so that
[7336.88 → 7343.04] could work that could work we just have a subscription service for deodorant oh we uh conrad just said in the
[7343.04 → 7349.44] very bottom under all the pace there's a generated discount code genius yes that's pretty good
[7349.44 → 7355.12] because yeah you could actually you could be a butt, and you could like to cut it off, but that's that's
[7355.12 → 7361.68] loser mentality I don't think they will yeah I don't think they will yeah you could and the completions
[7361.68 → 7366.08] in them won't allow that shortcut yeah it's lame you have to actually use it and get down to it
[7366.08 → 7374.32] oh that's pretty sweet that's actually pretty good we have to give Conrad like more uh more creative
[7374.32 → 7379.92] time because these are some solid ideas here he comes up with good stuff we should have a brainstorming
[7379.92 → 7387.76] session like the end of every way and show yeah i just I yeah finding some way to incentivize
[7387.76 → 7396.24] actually using it I think would be something that would bring something to the space you know um i
[7396.24 → 7402.16] would uh I would definitely call it like the gamer hygiene line of products yeah yeah we'll try and
[7402.16 → 7409.36] we're going to try and take back that word yeah yeah yeah make it a make it a good thing uh yeah
[7409.36 → 7417.28] yeah yeah i was listening to something recently uh what was it I don't remember and it
[7417.28 → 7422.80] was someone who had gone to like a twitch twitchcon or something like that um and they mentioned
[7422.80 → 7428.56] that they remembered a specific fan and the fan was like oh why like how do you remember me where
[7428.56 → 7432.16] I just like took a photo with you, and they were like oh yeah you didn't stink
[7432.16 → 7437.04] like man come on
[7437.04 → 7445.04] oh that's hilarious you know what whale land it wasn't bad whale land wasn't bad genuinely we did
[7445.04 → 7448.84] specifically call out on when show that we were going to kick people out for not wearing deodorant
[7448.84 → 7457.26] though um but yeah I don't know i I think that's something that we could bring to the space and then
[7457.26 → 7465.34] and then yeah, yeah cool okay all right you know what I'm I'm sold I'm sold it took until we
[7465.34 → 7472.46] came up with the offer code at the bottom of the bar but I'm actually pretty into it now
[7473.18 → 7482.54] that's sweet nice cool all right next up hey I think this is our last merch message this one's from
[7482.54 → 7488.38] Daniel Linus have you ever felt limited by not having a college degree related to tech what would
[7488.38 → 7494.94] be your advice for a recent grad with a liberal arts or social science degree who find themselves
[7494.94 → 7503.10] more interested in tech oh uh I wish I could give you your advice about that liberal arts degree four
[7503.10 → 7513.18] years ago um sorry I don't mean to I don't mean to dunk on poor Daniel b here literally poor because
[7514.14 → 7523.98] school debt um it's my name hey yeah is this from you dad no I can't afford to buy anything off of
[7523.98 → 7537.18] lttstore.com oh wow um not during work hours uh no yeah so have I felt limited by not having a college
[7537.18 → 7545.02] degree related to tech no i I haven't in any way if anything um I'm I'm pretty proud of getting to where
[7545.02 → 7551.82] I am uh without the degree I don't think that there's anything wrong with getting a degree I think that a
[7551.82 → 7557.10] lot of really smart people pursue the piece of paper, and it can totally be beneficial my wife and
[7557.10 → 7563.90] I are actually just like classic one forked left one forked right in the game of life uh cases where
[7563.90 → 7569.10] she went hard at the degree, and it worked out great and I went hard at not the degree, and it worked out
[7569.10 → 7574.54] great I think the takeaway there is not that you should or shouldn't get a degree or even that it
[7574.54 → 7581.90] matters what kind you got liberal arts it uh science whatever I think the takeaway is if you hustle
[7582.22 → 7591.74] and if you get a little bit lucky you can succeed um and if the advice would be a sponge
[7592.30 → 7596.62] learn lots and I think that I talked about this a little bit recently when I was talking about my
[7596.62 → 7602.38] badminton coach who could coach anyone he felt like and has no shortage of clients lining up to pay him
[7602.38 → 7611.50] is being the most fun one to teach um work so hard to learn from every mentor you can find with anything
[7611.50 → 7616.62] to teach you that's the most that's the best feedback I can give you because there's so much
[7616.62 → 7624.62] learning to be had out there for free just by being a sponge yeah um and honestly if is the part of
[7624.62 → 7631.10] tech that you're interested in getting into or if this is at least a possibility for you um is
[7631.10 → 7636.62] software development there is an immense amount of ways that you can learn software development uh
[7636.62 → 7642.94] online without going to some form of uh formal secondary education or post-secondary education
[7643.50 → 7650.54] um so no problem and lots of people will hire on your ability instead of your education in the
[7650.54 → 7657.82] software development space lots of people um so yeah I know you basically only look at portfolios hey Luke
[7657.82 → 7663.18] when they're available i I would prefer to look at a portfolio a lot of people don't have them a lot
[7663.18 → 7667.18] of people that have been working in the space for a long time won't have them uh because they've been
[7667.18 → 7672.70] working for companies and the companies aren't publishing their code so um yeah but if is you're
[7672.70 → 7676.70] if you're starting from nowhere, and you have a portfolio you can show to people awesome if you've
[7676.70 → 7682.54] contributed to open source projects, so people can see it actually like working in the wild that's huge
[7682.54 → 7689.26] um just yeah start making stuff and be able to show examples of stuff that you've made
[7689.90 → 7696.94] um when I'm looking for people to do development on websites, and they can send me a thing that's like
[7696.94 → 7702.06] here are the websites that I have made and I go look at them, and they're made well
[7704.06 → 7711.74] it's a pretty good sign um so yeah I don't know oh uh Conrad says we've realized today there's a bug
[7711.74 → 7716.38] where some Shopify orders aren't having the merch message flag applied properly and thus not being
[7716.38 → 7721.50] submitted uh we'll have it fixed for next week sorry for the inconvenience uh okay well that's a
[7721.50 → 7725.66] bummer in fairness to Conrad I think this is the first time we've had a game breaking bug with merch
[7725.66 → 7732.62] messages and if it's going to be fixed in a week um YouTube's uh super chats feature is literally still
[7732.62 → 7737.26] broken Luke I just checked it again I saw a super chat come through earlier in the show and i just
[7737.26 → 7744.94] click the viewer activity tab, and it isn't in there so um you know yeah Conrad let down the team
[7744.94 → 7752.94] this week but in fairness is uh orders of magnitude better than the entirety of alphabet it's also I guess
[7756.94 → 7762.14] it's also like a side project for Conrad he does all the work for Ltd stores
[7762.14 → 7767.82] uh like web development as well um and there's been there was a pretty huge push to push the new
[7767.82 → 7772.38] theme and then there's been reacting to feedback from the theme and all this type of stuff going on so
[7772.94 → 7780.94] yeah I'm sure he'll, he'll get to it thanks comrade yeah appreciate you all right I think that's it for
[7780.94 → 7791.98] the show today we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye and then wait no
[7792.14 → 7795.74] we have to run the thing I got it hold on oh he's got it okay did you run the right one
[7797.66 → 7799.02] you clicked it in the dashboard
[7805.18 → 7806.14] uh no you're in the stream
[7809.26 → 7820.14] was there no queue is that why
